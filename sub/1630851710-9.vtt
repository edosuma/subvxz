why did you not defend her?

40:53.167 --> 40:56.459
In the moment, I felt like she
was looking for a reaction.

40:56.459 --> 40:58.501
-This is not--
-Sandoval thinks that he

40:58.501 --> 40:59.584
can do whatever the [bleep]
he wants.

40:59.584 --> 41:00.751
-No, he does not.
-Yes, he does.

41:00.751 --> 41:02.375
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-Hey, just because you say it,

41:02.375 --> 41:05.209
doesn't make it true.
I'm watching it.

41:05.209 --> 41:06.709
Lala, Lala, Lala, just be--
exactly.

41:06.709 --> 41:07.501
-I'm watching him.
-Just because you say it

41:07.501 --> 41:09.709
doesn't make it true.

41:09.709 --> 41:12.584
I know I'm supposed to have
my wife back.

41:12.584 --> 41:15.751
Is it wrong to be objective
with someone you love?

41:15.751 --> 41:17.417
When Randall doesn't
have my back,

41:17.417 --> 41:20.792
he sleeps in another room.
-[laughs] Lala.

41:20.792 --> 41:22.667
Which doesn't happen often,
actually, at all.

41:22.667 --> 41:25.042
What if you're way out of line
and what if you're wrong?

41:25.042 --> 41:26.459
He talks to me about it
behind closed doors.

41:26.459 --> 41:27.709
And I do that, too.
And I do that, too,

41:27.709 --> 41:28.501
but that was a heated--
-And he lets me know

41:28.501 --> 41:29.751
in the moment...
-Yes.

41:29.751 --> 41:32.709
..."I'm ride or die for you,
even though you done ----ed up."

41:32.709 --> 41:33.542
He's good about that.
You're right. You're right.

41:33.542 --> 41:35.667
-Yes.
-You're right, you're right.

41:35.667 --> 41:38.000
And Katie is
a strong mother----er,

41:38.000 --> 41:39.501
and she gets--I don't know why
I'm getting upset about this.

41:39.501 --> 41:42.250
-Lala, Lala, you know I'm--
-Can you hand me a thing?

41:42.250 --> 41:44.083
Oh, sorry, yeah.

41:44.083 --> 41:48.042
Katie and I have been friends
for a minute now.

41:48.042 --> 41:50.709
And to see that she can't be
vulnerable with her partner

41:50.709 --> 41:54.542
because she feels like she's
gotta be in defense mode,

41:54.542 --> 41:56.292
it is heart-breaking for me.

41:56.292 --> 41:58.709
If Sandoval says, "I don't want
her involved in the bar,"

41:58.709 --> 42:01.417
say, "Sandoval, this is my wife.

42:01.417 --> 42:02.542
I need you
to back your sh-- up."

42:02.542 --> 42:04.417
They are like
brother and sister.

42:04.417 --> 42:06.000
They have a deep-rooted history.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.334
What are you talking about?

42:07.334 --> 42:08.834
No, I'm saying they have
a deep-rooted friendship,

42:08.834 --> 42:10.375
and there's a lot
of history there.

42:10.375 --> 42:11.876
Oh, my God.
I can't understand you.

42:11.876 --> 42:13.459
-You're iso--
-I think you have--

42:13.459 --> 42:15.584
Oh, it's 'cause Sandoval's dick
is in your mouth.

42:15.584 --> 42:17.375
Sorry.

42:17.375 --> 42:20.584
Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:20.584 --> 42:24.459
-Look, I'm doing it!
-Do it, do it, do it, yes!

42:24.459 --> 42:27.751
Whoa! Whoa! Whoo!

42:27.751 --> 42:30.834
So we're doing this
because of your nose?

42:30.834 --> 42:31.792
Yeah.

42:31.792 --> 42:34.375
There's a customer
for every type of feet.

42:34.375 --> 42:37.042
This is, like,
quite possibly, like,

42:37.042 --> 42:39.542
the dumbest, most amazing thing
that we've ever done.

42:39.542 --> 42:43.250
-Basically, he lost a bet.
-Ah. Ah.

42:43.250 --> 42:45.542
I pray Katie's not gonna
kill me.

42:45.542 --> 42:46.876
Tom.

42:46.876 --> 42:48.125
One of the dudes, like,
grabbed me,

42:48.125 --> 42:49.584
like, right here, like...

42:49.584 --> 42:50.876
Did you say anything
to Brock or Scheana?

42:50.876 --> 42:52.125
No, Scheana was standing
right there.

42:52.125 --> 42:53.626
She didn't say anything to him.

42:53.626 --> 42:55.834
And I feel like I've been
so loyal to you,

42:55.834 --> 42:58.375
and it has not been
reciprocated at all.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.167
[crying] I, like,
wanna go home to my baby.

43:00.167 --> 43:04.209
I don't even wanna be here
anymore.
