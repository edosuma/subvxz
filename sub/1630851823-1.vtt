About once a month,

03:05.582 --> 03:07.437
my friends and I get together

03:07.502 --> 03:09.771
and do something different
for fun.

03:09.838 --> 03:11.212
Sometimes we go bowling

03:11.278 --> 03:12.619
or miniature golf

03:12.686 --> 03:14.541
or a movie or something.

03:14.606 --> 03:15.589
One night,

03:15.662 --> 03:18.445
we went down
to a Gypsy palm reader

03:18.542 --> 03:20.397
on 34th and Vine.

03:24.846 --> 03:26.701
Let me see your palm.

03:47.630 --> 03:50.477
You do very badly with women.

03:51.502 --> 03:54.251
No. I... I... I...
I do all right.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.693
No, you don't.

03:55.758 --> 03:57.613
There are no women here.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.251
What's this?

04:05.838 --> 04:06.797
No women.

04:07.694 --> 04:09.669
Are you
a boy-kissy-boy?

04:09.742 --> 04:11.684
Excuse me?

04:11.758 --> 04:13.219
You a homosexual?

04:14.990 --> 04:16.331
No.

04:16.398 --> 04:19.213
I want my sister to see this.

04:27.918 --> 04:29.293
No, I don't.

04:29.358 --> 04:30.317
No.

04:30.318 --> 04:33.133
I see no women in your life

04:33.198 --> 04:35.434
for a long, long time.

04:35.502 --> 04:36.779
Maybe...

04:38.894 --> 04:40.388
forever.

04:40.462 --> 04:42.436
Well, that's
kind of depressing.

04:42.510 --> 04:43.884
Yes, it is.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.667
But I have something for you.

05:09.454 --> 05:10.829
Let me see.

05:10.894 --> 05:11.853
Number 17,

05:11.854 --> 05:13.709
number 13.

05:13.774 --> 05:15.879
Where the hell is it?

05:15.950 --> 05:17.576
Ahh.

05:17.646 --> 05:19.434
Number eight.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.473
This is what you need.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.700
Dilute this with water
1,000 to 1.

05:26.798 --> 05:29.132
You don't want it
to be too strong.

05:29.198 --> 05:32.013
You take a sip,
and you swallow.

05:32.078 --> 05:33.452
And when you speak,

05:33.518 --> 05:36.267
women will find you
fascinating.

05:36.334 --> 05:38.636
I'm a biochemist.

06:03.469 --> 06:04.844
You take this.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.752
You'll be back.

06:09.229 --> 06:11.564
So, tell me,
there was this woman

06:11.630 --> 06:13.964
I saw you having lunch
with the other day.

06:14.029 --> 06:14.988
Huh?

06:15.054 --> 06:17.355
She's just...
just somebody I work with.

06:17.422 --> 06:18.381
Uh-huh.

06:18.414 --> 06:20.138
Were there any
romantic possibilities?

06:22.094 --> 06:23.053
No.

06:23.054 --> 06:24.013
No?

06:25.102 --> 06:26.214
Why not?

06:27.374 --> 06:28.748
No, you see, I'm...

06:28.814 --> 06:30.636
She's, um, she's not my type.

06:30.734 --> 06:32.108
Oh, she's not your type.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.548
That was a lie.

06:33.614 --> 06:35.948
Except for the fact
that she had

06:36.014 --> 06:37.388
kind of a boyfriend,

06:37.454 --> 06:38.861
Diane was exactly my type.

06:38.958 --> 06:41.773
I'm a comparative
psychobiologist.

06:41.838 --> 06:43.561
I put, uh, primates...

06:43.630 --> 06:45.005
chimpanzees...
through tests.

06:45.070 --> 06:47.404
I note the behavior
of the subject,

06:47.470 --> 06:49.925
and I hope the results
are analogous to humans.

06:49.998 --> 06:52.519
Do you put electrical things
in their brains?

06:52.590 --> 06:53.669
No.

06:53.742 --> 06:54.701
No.

06:54.702 --> 06:56.524
But that's done, isn't it?

06:56.590 --> 06:57.549
Yes.

06:58.510 --> 06:59.590
Why?

06:59.662 --> 07:01.036
You can measure
electrical activity,

07:01.134 --> 07:03.468
or, with a minute
amount of current,

07:03.534 --> 07:05.803
you can stimulate a feeling
or... or a thought.

07:05.869 --> 07:07.430
You can stimulate a feeling?

07:07.534 --> 07:08.493
Yes.

07:08.494 --> 07:09.453
For example,

07:09.454 --> 07:10.829
there was this experiment

07:10.894 --> 07:12.749
where an electrode was planted

07:12.814 --> 07:15.629
in the pleasure center
of a monkey's brain.

07:15.694 --> 07:18.028
When the monkey hit a button,

07:18.094 --> 07:20.909
it sent a signal
to the electrode,

07:20.974 --> 07:23.756
in effect exciting
the monkey sexually.

07:23.822 --> 07:24.781
You're kidding.

07:24.782 --> 07:25.796
No.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.725
Can you guess what happened?

07:27.790 --> 07:29.284
Was it a male monkey?

07:29.358 --> 07:30.569
Yes.

07:30.638 --> 07:33.004
He slammed the button
till he died.

07:33.070 --> 07:35.241
Oh, so, you know
this experiment.

07:35.342 --> 07:37.065
I know men, honey.

07:38.190 --> 07:39.149
Oh, stop.

07:41.742 --> 07:45.038
I think she is definitely
Paul's type.

07:45.102 --> 07:46.476
She's got that, uh...

07:46.542 --> 07:48.200
je ne sais quoi,

07:48.270 --> 07:49.229
that, uh...

07:49.230 --> 07:50.604
Very sexy girl.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.004
You should go talk to her.

07:53.069 --> 07:54.028
Really.

07:54.029 --> 07:55.404
You should do it.

07:57.998 --> 07:58.957
Do it.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.300
I don't know her.

08:00.366 --> 08:01.740
Well, that is the point.

08:01.805 --> 08:03.180
You go talk to her,

08:03.246 --> 08:04.620
then you'll know her.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.020
Well, maybe she doesn't
want to talk to anybody.

08:07.118 --> 08:08.077
Maybe.

08:08.078 --> 08:09.452
Maybe she does, huh?

08:09.518 --> 08:11.373
You got to keep taking chances,

08:11.438 --> 08:12.812
keep rolling the dice

08:12.878 --> 08:15.627
till you find someone
who does want to talk.

08:15.694 --> 08:16.839
Expert advice.

08:16.909 --> 08:17.868
Go.

08:17.869 --> 08:19.363
Go.

08:19.437 --> 08:21.128
I'll tell you what.

08:21.198 --> 08:24.493
I'll pay you $20
to go talk to her.

08:26.350 --> 08:28.652
$20.Just go
talk to her.

08:28.718 --> 08:29.765
No.

08:31.565 --> 08:32.743
$40.

08:33.774 --> 08:36.076
I don't want to do it.

08:36.142 --> 08:37.188
$60.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.236
$80.

08:41.998 --> 08:43.307

Hi. Hi.

Hi.

09:28.430 --> 09:29.389
Uh-oh.

09:29.390 --> 09:30.764
I don't believe this.

09:30.829 --> 09:31.942
Can I, uh, uh,

09:32.014 --> 09:34.348
can I buy you a drink?

09:34.414 --> 09:36.716
Can I ask you a question?

09:36.782 --> 09:37.960
Sure.

09:38.030 --> 09:40.364
Why do you think
I'd be interested in you?

09:40.429 --> 09:42.764
Did I look at you
or smile at you?

09:42.861 --> 09:44.236
Did I flirt with you?

09:44.302 --> 09:45.414
No.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.787
Well, then what makes you
think I'd be interested?

09:47.854 --> 09:50.188
Are you somebody special?
Is that it?

09:50.254 --> 09:52.108
Do you do something
really fascinating?

09:52.174 --> 09:54.508
What do you do for a living?

09:54.574 --> 09:56.429
Uh, I'm...
I'm a biochemist.

09:56.494 --> 09:59.364
Do I look like
a biochemist groupie?

09:59.437 --> 10:02.950
Well, biochemists
don't have groupies.

10:03.021 --> 10:05.126
Why do you think that is?

10:05.197 --> 10:08.361
Well, it's not
a very glamorous job.

10:08.429 --> 10:12.041
No, it's not one of your
drop-dead glamorous jobs.

10:12.109 --> 10:13.353
I mean,

10:13.422 --> 10:16.553
I'm sure that you find chemicals
very fascinating,

10:16.654 --> 10:18.988
but do I look like somebody
who'd be interested

10:19.054 --> 10:20.013
in a...

10:20.014 --> 10:20.973
a... a...

10:20.974 --> 10:22.796
a chemical person?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.124
No. Hey, wait.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.045
I'm doing this
for your benefit.

10:28.110 --> 10:30.444
I mean, you wouldn't want this
to happen again,

10:30.509 --> 10:31.589
would you?

10:31.662 --> 10:33.386
No.

10:33.454 --> 10:35.308
No. What's very
obvious to me

10:35.374 --> 10:36.748
is not to you.

10:36.814 --> 10:38.188
Look at your clothes

10:38.254 --> 10:39.595
and then look at mine.

10:39.661 --> 10:42.444
Do you see any kind
of a difference here?

10:42.510 --> 10:43.884
Clothes aren't
important to you,

10:43.949 --> 10:45.324
but they're important to me.

10:45.421 --> 10:46.763
Taste is very important.

10:46.862 --> 10:49.196
I like designer clothes.
I like nice things.

10:49.261 --> 10:51.628
I drive a BMW.
What about you?

10:51.725 --> 10:53.994
Uh, I drive a Volkswagen.

10:55.438 --> 10:56.812
- Fahrvergnugen.
- Fahrvergnugen.

10:56.877 --> 10:58.765
You know what that
really means?

10:58.830 --> 11:00.291
Can't afford the Mercedes.

11:02.670 --> 11:04.044
Well, you're right.

11:04.109 --> 11:06.924
We're not really
suited for each other,

11:06.989 --> 11:08.844
and, uh, so I'll just go

11:08.909 --> 11:11.244
and get myself a chemical girl.

11:11.310 --> 11:12.171
I'm sorry.

11:12.237 --> 11:14.790
I was just trying
to make a point.

11:14.862 --> 11:16.236
I tell you what.

11:16.302 --> 11:18.156
I'll go home with you tonight

11:18.253 --> 11:20.675
and be your total sex slave...

11:21.806 --> 11:25.101
if you can answer
one question correctly.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.759
Ahem.

11:26.830 --> 11:28.106
All right.

11:28.174 --> 11:29.668
Who designed this top?

11:32.974 --> 11:34.348
I wouldn't know.

11:35.789 --> 11:38.157
Bye-bye, now.

12:00.366 --> 12:03.562
You're supposed to come
to a complete stop at the sign.

12:03.629 --> 12:05.801
Can I see your driver's license,
your registration,

12:05.870 --> 12:07.724
your proof
of insurance, please?

12:07.790 --> 12:08.837
Yeah.

12:08.910 --> 12:11.659
What the hell
kind of car is this?

12:11.725 --> 12:13.449
It's an Alta Pazzoli.

12:17.933 --> 12:19.395
My car s-stalls

12:19.501 --> 12:21.836
unless I keep
my... my foot on the gas,

12:21.902 --> 12:25.382
and I was just trying to get...

12:25.453 --> 12:27.787
I've already had
two moving violations this year,

12:27.854 --> 12:31.628
and if I get a third,
they might cancel my insurance, so...

12:31.694 --> 12:34.694
do you think
that maybe you could...

12:34.765 --> 12:36.620
please make this a warning?

12:37.645 --> 12:39.915
Is this your correct address?

12:41.229 --> 12:42.188
Yeah.

13:14.702 --> 13:15.661
Hello.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.320
You have zero messages.

13:20.173 --> 13:21.132
Hello.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.693
You have zero messages.

13:37.965 --> 13:38.924
Bad.

13:38.925 --> 13:40.300
This is bad.

13:40.366 --> 13:41.325
Bad.

13:41.326 --> 13:42.503
Bad.

13:42.573 --> 13:43.532
Bad.

13:46.605 --> 13:47.980
Come here.
Come here.

14:23.822 --> 14:24.781
Bad rice.

14:24.782 --> 14:25.741
Bad rice.

14:25.742 --> 14:26.701
Be quiet.

14:27.822 --> 14:29.196
I am very serious.

14:30.605 --> 14:31.979
So am I.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.164
I love you so much.

14:37.229 --> 14:39.596
I want to tell you
that I love you.

15:10.702 --> 15:11.661
Hello.

15:14.094 --> 15:15.468
It's all right.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.388
You don't have to apologize.

15:17.453 --> 15:20.268
I made 100 bucks
off of it, didn't I?

15:22.765 --> 15:24.521
A gift?

15:24.589 --> 15:25.571
Right now?

15:27.182 --> 15:28.141
Well, yeah.

15:28.142 --> 15:29.898
Well, what kind of gift?

15:33.038 --> 15:34.499
Hi.

15:35.566 --> 15:36.875
Ahem.

15:36.942 --> 15:38.120

Yeah.

Are you alone?

15:51.981 --> 15:53.836
Yes, of course I'm alone.

16:47.533 --> 16:50.348
No. I've had it
about a year.

16:54.894 --> 16:56.268
It looks new.

16:58.253 --> 17:01.068
Well, I keep it in good shape.

17:02.893 --> 17:05.227
Are you still working
with your father?

17:05.292 --> 17:06.252
Yeah.

17:06.252 --> 17:07.212
Yeah.

17:07.213 --> 17:08.172
Yeah.

17:09.550 --> 17:10.509
What?

17:14.477 --> 17:15.786
I...

17:24.396 --> 17:25.356
Oh, man.

17:33.389 --> 17:34.764
Got to go.

17:40.589 --> 17:41.548
Did you...

17:41.549 --> 17:43.404
put on a little weight?

17:57.709 --> 17:59.564
Uh, can I get you something?

17:59.629 --> 18:01.003
What do you got?

18:01.069 --> 18:02.924
I have some terrific wines.

18:02.989 --> 18:04.996
Do you have any, uh...

18:07.662 --> 18:08.621
gin?

18:08.718 --> 18:09.677
Gin?

18:09.678 --> 18:10.637
Sure.

18:10.638 --> 18:12.012
Gin on the rocks.

18:12.077 --> 18:13.451
Gin on the rocks.

18:13.518 --> 18:14.477
Um...

18:15.949 --> 18:16.908
gin.

18:16.909 --> 18:18.796
Tangueray, if you got it.

18:18.861 --> 18:20.236
O.K.

18:28.301 --> 18:30.090
Can I use your bathroom?

19:12.845 --> 19:14.219
How'd it go?

19:14.285 --> 19:15.660
Great.

19:15.725 --> 19:17.580
He just wanted to talk.

19:18.829 --> 19:21.163
Oh, you should've
seen his stereo.

19:22.189 --> 19:24.774
I bet it's worth thousands.

20:53.229 --> 20:54.440
Oh!

21:05.358 --> 21:06.317
Pay attention.

21:06.318 --> 21:07.430
Pay attention.

21:08.461 --> 21:09.922
Number six.

21:20.941 --> 21:23.210
I've got to talk to you.

21:23.277 --> 21:25.611
I've got to tell you something.

21:25.677 --> 21:28.011
About four hours later,
they started to leave.

21:28.077 --> 21:29.451
Whatever had happened

21:29.517 --> 21:30.891
had stopped happening.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.291
And then,
when I was cleaning up,

21:33.357 --> 21:35.211
I found this in some milk.

21:35.277 --> 21:36.236
Milk.

21:36.237 --> 21:37.611
You get it?

21:37.677 --> 21:40.328
I mean, cats like milk.

21:40.397 --> 21:41.379
Yeah?

21:41.453 --> 21:43.722
Well, the Gypsy said
when you speak, right?

21:43.789 --> 21:46.123
So, maybe it has something
to do with sound.

21:46.189 --> 21:48.523
I mean, after all,
you scratch a blackboard,

21:48.589 --> 21:50.891
and it drives you up the wall.

21:50.988 --> 21:52.843
Maybe there's a sound that...

21:52.908 --> 21:55.723
you know, drives you up
another wall.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.123
You don't believe me?

21:58.189 --> 22:01.004
No. I'd... I'd like
to believe you.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.240
What do you want from me?

22:05.421 --> 22:07.276
Now,
are... are you sure?

22:07.341 --> 22:08.715
Are you absolutely positive?

22:08.781 --> 22:09.740
I'm positive.

22:09.741 --> 22:11.115
Nothing to worry about.

22:11.181 --> 22:12.555
It's a...
It's a salt.

22:12.621 --> 22:14.475
It's a condensed liquid salt.

22:15.565 --> 22:17.899
You want me to take it?

22:17.965 --> 22:18.924
No.

22:21.645 --> 22:22.604
O.K.

22:44.013 --> 22:45.868
Didn't sound unusual to me.

22:47.053 --> 22:49.158
How'd it sound to you?

22:49.229 --> 22:52.044
Well, I... I mean,
I... I wouldn't know.

22:52.109 --> 22:55.273
Is that an unusual sound
for a chimp?

22:55.373 --> 22:56.332
No.

23:03.853 --> 23:05.227
That... That's Romeo.

23:05.293 --> 23:07.627
He's trying to break
through the wall!

23:07.693 --> 23:09.383
What's he trying to do?

23:10.541 --> 23:12.516
He's breaking through the wall!

23:33.549 --> 23:34.924
No, no, no. Don't.

23:34.989 --> 23:36.363
He'll rip your arm off.

23:36.429 --> 23:37.388
Don't. Don't.

23:37.389 --> 23:38.348
Well, I...

24:03.757 --> 24:05.131
Is he dead?

24:09.933 --> 24:10.892
No.

24:14.317 --> 24:15.910
He's asleep.

24:17.485 --> 24:19.786
After weeks of testing,

24:19.853 --> 24:21.227
we discovered how it works.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.140
When swallowed, it affects
the vocal cords directly,

24:24.205 --> 24:25.317
so when you speak,

24:25.389 --> 24:28.106
microtremors encoded
within your voice

24:28.173 --> 24:29.864
stimulate tiny little hairs

24:29.933 --> 24:32.486
in the inner ear
of the opposite sex.

24:32.557 --> 24:34.629
The vibration sends
a signal to the brain,

24:34.733 --> 24:37.122
which, in turn,
produces a combination

24:37.228 --> 24:38.887
of mood-altering
endogenous chemicals

24:38.988 --> 24:41.803
responsible for
the biochemical process

24:41.868 --> 24:42.827
of feeling in love.

24:42.893 --> 24:44.234
We also discovered that, one...

24:44.300 --> 24:46.886
It made members
of the same sex hostile.

24:46.957 --> 24:47.916
Two...

24:47.917 --> 24:49.859
It had to be diluted.

24:49.933 --> 24:51.755
Full strength
was far too strong.

24:51.821 --> 24:52.934
And three...

24:53.005 --> 24:55.655
It would only work
for four hours at a time.

24:55.725 --> 24:58.539
The next logical step
was to test it on humans,

24:58.605 --> 24:59.619
but who?

25:01.517 --> 25:03.524
We felt a deep
moral obligation to mankind

25:03.596 --> 25:06.630
to make sure this
potentially dangerous drug

25:06.732 --> 25:08.587
didn't fall into
the wrong hands,

25:08.652 --> 25:12.962
but where could we find
test subjects we could trust?

25:13.069 --> 25:15.884
Th-this is
scientifically unorthodox,

25:15.949 --> 25:17.323
but...

25:17.388 --> 25:19.243
perhaps we could
both take samples

25:19.308 --> 25:21.796
and test it ourselves in
a real-world environment.

25:23.308 --> 25:25.829
I mean, Diane, we're both...

25:25.901 --> 25:29.316
prudent and... and
responsible people.

25:32.685 --> 25:34.725
So, for the sake
of all mankind,

25:34.797 --> 25:36.804
we divided up the remainder
of the potion

25:36.877 --> 25:39.299
and agreed not to speak
for three weeks.

25:51.213 --> 25:53.220
Can I see your driver's license,
your registration,

25:53.293 --> 25:54.820
your proof of
insurance, please?

26:51.085 --> 26:52.775
Let's just...

26:55.085 --> 26:56.940
let this go with a warning.

26:58.509 --> 26:59.556
Thank you.

27:00.685 --> 27:01.644
Heh heh.

27:01.676 --> 27:05.899
I... I get off
in... in about an hour...

27:05.965 --> 27:08.104
and, uh...

27:08.173 --> 27:11.239
I was... I was
wondering...

27:11.309 --> 27:12.738
could we maybe...

27:15.501 --> 27:16.875
have a drink?

27:16.940 --> 27:20.236
I don't think so.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.192
Insurance has been canceled.

27:43.468 --> 27:45.192
"R.T. Moreno."

28:04.940 --> 28:05.922

very beautiful, isn't it?

30:01.612 --> 30:03.106
Yes, it is.

30:05.773 --> 30:06.732
Dino!

30:11.372 --> 30:12.485
Si, signore.

30:16.653 --> 30:18.027
Has anybody ever told you

30:18.092 --> 30:19.467
how beautiful you are?

30:21.293 --> 30:22.438
No.

30:22.509 --> 30:24.549
Nobody in their right mind.

30:40.333 --> 30:42.023
Excuse me, please.

30:47.373 --> 30:50.188
I have met beautiful
women before...

30:50.253 --> 30:52.424
many beautiful women...

30:52.492 --> 30:53.451
but you...

30:53.452 --> 30:55.110
you are the most
beautiful woman

30:55.180 --> 30:57.035
I have ever seen in my life.

31:07.052 --> 31:08.907
I know this sounds ridiculous,

31:08.972 --> 31:12.834
but do you believe in
love at first sight?

31:15.788 --> 31:16.836
Bravo!

31:20.428 --> 31:21.475
La via!

31:24.749 --> 31:27.170
I want you to have this.

31:34.509 --> 31:35.883
I can't.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.091
Please, indulge me.
Take it.

31:41.164 --> 31:43.019
I don't feel
this way very often,

31:43.084 --> 31:45.637
and I would like
you to have this.

31:45.708 --> 31:46.756
Oh!

31:46.829 --> 31:47.974
This is your car?

31:55.885 --> 31:58.602
This is an Alta Pazzoli.

31:58.668 --> 31:59.878
I know.

31:59.948 --> 32:01.225
I am Enrico Pazzoli.

32:01.293 --> 32:03.846
I own the company
that manufactures this car.

32:08.268 --> 32:09.577
Thank you.

32:14.125 --> 32:17.420
The governor is giving
a little party this evening.

32:17.484 --> 32:20.266
I have nobody to accompany me.

32:20.333 --> 32:22.187
Would you please come with me?

32:25.645 --> 32:27.881
I... I really
don't think so.

32:27.948 --> 32:29.093
Why? Are you married?

32:29.164 --> 32:30.342
No, no.

32:30.412 --> 32:32.419
You are engaged?
You have a fiance?

32:32.492 --> 32:33.451
No, no.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.827
A lover?
A boyfriend?

32:34.893 --> 32:35.940
Um... no.

32:36.045 --> 32:37.004
A girlfriend?

32:37.005 --> 32:37.964
No!

32:37.965 --> 32:40.004
Then, uh, your
grandmother is sick,

32:40.108 --> 32:41.799
and you must stay with her?

32:41.868 --> 32:42.827
She's dead.

32:42.828 --> 32:43.787
I'm sorry.

32:43.788 --> 32:45.697
It's O.K.
She died 20 years ago.

32:45.772 --> 32:48.227
Then why don't you
come with me?

33:05.868 --> 33:07.078
Buona sera.

33:12.941 --> 33:15.242
Is something wrong?

33:18.060 --> 33:20.231
You're wearing a tuxedo.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.259
Oh, of course.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.537
The party's a formal affair.

33:22.604 --> 33:24.230
Didn't I tell you?

33:24.301 --> 33:25.260
No.

33:25.261 --> 33:26.951
Ohh...
I'm sorry.

33:27.020 --> 33:28.068
I'm so sorry.

33:28.141 --> 33:29.995
But we have plenty of time.

33:30.061 --> 33:31.435
Please, put on a gown.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.355
I will be happy to wait.

33:36.429 --> 33:39.020
I don't own a gown.

34:09.516 --> 34:12.101
Royalty usually arrives
after the guests.

34:12.172 --> 34:16.427
However, Prince Geoffrey didn't
want to miss meeting any of the girls.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.558
It is all right.

34:59.628 --> 35:01.002
Don't be afraid.

35:02.188 --> 35:03.879
You look, uh...

35:03.948 --> 35:05.322
meravigliosa.

35:13.228 --> 35:15.400
And in the alpha males,
seratonin receptor levels

35:15.468 --> 35:17.158
were found to be
up-regulated,

35:17.228 --> 35:18.603
and cetohybridization has shown

35:18.668 --> 35:20.740
that they will co-localize
with dopamine.

35:20.812 --> 35:22.089
- Well! - Hmm!
- Oh!

35:22.156 --> 35:27.077
What's the difference between
ignorance and indifference?

35:27.148 --> 35:29.003
I don't know, and I don't care.

35:51.404 --> 35:53.259
Enrico, thank you.

35:53.324 --> 35:54.283
Good night.

35:55.404 --> 35:56.931
Oh, my God.

35:59.884 --> 36:00.931

Oh, yeah.

it would scare you.

Nope.

Is that direct enough for you?

40:11.212 --> 40:12.171
Yeah, yeah.

40:12.236 --> 40:13.480
That was excellent,

So why don't we just
get out of here?

O.K. I-I'll

you've ever wanted in a man

40:31.020 --> 40:33.158
if...

40:33.227 --> 40:37.483
you can answer one
question correctly.

40:37.548 --> 40:39.523
What?

40:39.595 --> 40:41.984
How do you synthesize
a methylated alkaloid?

40:42.060 --> 40:44.580
I don't know.

40:48.268 --> 40:49.315
Bye, now.

40:53.452 --> 40:54.411
Yes.

40:54.412 --> 40:56.037
Yes! Yes!

40:56.108 --> 40:57.701
Yes!

40:57.804 --> 40:59.145
Whoo!

41:00.780 --> 41:03.081
It was late,
but the bars were open,

41:03.148 --> 41:05.002
and I still felt the urge

41:05.068 --> 41:06.791
to continue with my research.

41:33.804 --> 41:35.659
It was 100% effective.

41:35.724 --> 41:37.579
No matter what they were doing

41:37.644 --> 41:39.018
or whoever they were with,

41:39.084 --> 41:40.545
they wanted you!

41:40.620 --> 41:43.402
You were the one they were
looking for their entire lives.

41:43.467 --> 41:44.929
You were funny, intelligent,

41:45.004 --> 41:48.517
but above all,
you were very, very sexy.

41:50.700 --> 41:53.514
It worked,
and it worked miracles.

41:53.580 --> 41:56.394
It absolutely eliminated
any fear that they

41:56.460 --> 41:58.794
wouldn't like you or that
you weren't good enough.

41:58.860 --> 42:01.730
Instead of taking years of painfully
coming to grips with reality,

42:01.836 --> 42:03.014
you change reality.

42:03.115 --> 42:04.544
Reality comes to you.

42:06.444 --> 42:08.419
You didn't have to be
good-looking,

42:08.523 --> 42:10.050
well-dressed, or rich.

42:10.124 --> 42:11.979
It didn't matter.

42:12.044 --> 42:15.492
You just had to speak.

42:15.564 --> 42:17.090
So...

42:17.163 --> 42:19.716
how do you like those pretzels?

42:26.444 --> 42:28.866
And you didn't have to
be funny, intelligent,

42:28.939 --> 42:29.921
or insightful.

42:29.995 --> 42:31.686
It didn't matter what you said.

42:31.756 --> 42:34.626
Content had nothing
to do with it.

42:34.732 --> 42:35.747
So...

42:35.852 --> 42:37.641
you like those radials?

42:54.220 --> 42:56.074
They say that power corrupts,

42:56.140 --> 42:59.271
and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

42:59.340 --> 43:01.347
Well...

43:01.420 --> 43:02.467
they're right.

43:03.660 --> 43:05.831
They also say that
the path of excess

43:05.931 --> 43:08.004
leads to the palace of wisdom.

43:08.108 --> 43:10.311
My palace of wisdom

43:10.380 --> 43:13.991
was the Sigma Delta Pi
Sorority House.

43:35.627 --> 43:37.482
I learned a lot that night.

43:37.547 --> 43:39.205
I learned a lot about myself.

43:39.308 --> 43:40.682
I learned a lot about women.

43:40.748 --> 43:43.366
I also learned about
an obscure panty raid law

43:43.436 --> 43:46.218
which prohibits men
to be in a sorority house

43:46.284 --> 43:47.877
after 9 p.m.

44:35.211 --> 44:37.121
How's it going?

44:37.227 --> 44:38.307
Can I help you?

44:38.412 --> 44:40.779
No. I'm here
to see a friend.

44:40.875 --> 44:41.988
And who is that?

44:42.060 --> 44:43.270
Diane Farrow.

44:43.339 --> 44:44.714
I'm sorry, but Miss Farrow

44:44.780 --> 44:45.860
isn't expecting company.

44:45.932 --> 44:48.103
Oh, I'm just dropping by.

44:48.172 --> 44:49.666
I'm sorry.

44:50.988 --> 44:53.322
Listen, why don't
you go tell her

44:53.387 --> 44:56.354
that Gary Logan is here?

44:56.427 --> 44:57.442
All right.

44:57.516 --> 45:00.167
Stan, there's a
Gary Logan out here

45:00.236 --> 45:01.610
to see Miss Farrow.

45:07.020 --> 45:08.427
I'm sorry.

45:08.524 --> 45:10.531
You're kidding.

45:10.635 --> 45:12.578
No.
She has company.

45:13.900 --> 45:14.859
Oh.

45:17.387 --> 45:19.013
Who is that guy?

45:19.084 --> 45:21.058
Prince Geoffrey.

45:21.131 --> 45:23.171
Prince?

45:23.244 --> 45:25.219
Prince of what?

45:25.292 --> 45:26.753
England.

45:33.867 --> 45:35.242
Unbelievable.

45:37.676 --> 45:39.650
Ahem.

45:39.756 --> 45:41.250
Is, uh...

45:41.355 --> 45:42.730
Thank you.

45:42.796 --> 45:44.170
Right through here?

45:46.507 --> 45:47.466
Diane?

45:53.964 --> 45:55.338
Wow!

45:57.804 --> 45:58.949
- Bye!
- Bye, Diane!

45:59.980 --> 46:02.849
Jesus Christ,
you... you look great!

46:02.923 --> 46:05.095
What did you do?

46:05.164 --> 46:07.171
You got a haircut?

46:07.244 --> 46:10.986
Well, that is a great haircut.

46:11.084 --> 46:12.328
You got your teeth fixed.

46:12.427 --> 46:14.729
Oh, you're on the potion!

46:14.795 --> 46:15.810
You're on the po...

46:20.011 --> 46:21.670
So, uh...

46:21.740 --> 46:23.594
nice... nice clothes.

46:23.660 --> 46:25.547
Did you buy those?

46:26.763 --> 46:27.722
Really?

46:27.723 --> 46:29.992
Ah. Having fun, huh?

46:32.139 --> 46:33.830
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

46:33.899 --> 46:35.590
Yeah.

46:35.659 --> 46:37.252
"What were you doing

46:37.323 --> 46:39.112
in the sorority?"

46:39.180 --> 46:40.227
Uh...

46:40.300 --> 46:42.722
what was I doing
in the sorority?

46:42.827 --> 46:45.577
Ha ha ha ha ha...

46:47.052 --> 46:48.426
Oh, no.

46:50.892 --> 46:53.063
I... I was, um...

46:53.132 --> 46:54.626
I was, uh...

46:56.620 --> 46:58.475
I can't tell you.
I'm sorry. I can't.

46:58.540 --> 47:00.231
I was doing research.

47:00.300 --> 47:01.609
I... I was.

47:01.675 --> 47:02.853
What?

47:02.924 --> 47:03.883
What?

47:06.860 --> 47:07.819
What?

47:09.259 --> 47:10.633
Oh, you're kidding.

47:10.700 --> 47:13.350
Heh. Uh... heh heh.

47:13.419 --> 47:14.794
Uh... ahem.

47:14.892 --> 47:16.801
All right,
all right, all right.

47:16.907 --> 47:19.242
Can you keep a secret?

47:19.307 --> 47:20.714
So can I.

47:22.347 --> 47:24.038
I'm sorry.
I... I just...

47:25.516 --> 47:27.371
Oh, look, that is not fair,

47:27.436 --> 47:28.810
because you're on the potion.

47:28.875 --> 47:29.988
You can't talk.

47:30.060 --> 47:31.915
How do I know you
haven't been doing

47:31.980 --> 47:33.354
some unspeakably sordid things?

47:33.419 --> 47:34.378
What?

47:39.595 --> 47:40.555
You're kidding.

47:45.164 --> 47:46.244
What are you,

47:46.347 --> 47:48.965
dating the president?

47:49.067 --> 47:50.441
Who's in there?

47:59.212 --> 48:02.059
You look familiar.

48:02.123 --> 48:04.905
Uh, I'm the prince of England.

48:09.195 --> 48:10.570
Ow.

48:10.636 --> 48:11.813
Oh.

48:11.883 --> 48:15.844
Paul, we're going to
a charity arts auction tonight.

48:15.915 --> 48:17.290
Would you like to come?

48:17.387 --> 48:18.980
You're not speaking.

48:21.131 --> 48:22.506
Why aren't you speaking?

48:23.627 --> 48:25.536
You notice Diane
isn't speaking?

48:27.371 --> 48:31.200
Oh! You're playing the mute game
again, aren't you?

48:31.275 --> 48:32.584
Yes, you are!

48:33.899 --> 48:35.623
She's playing
the mute game again.

48:35.692 --> 48:36.772
Really?

48:39.915 --> 48:42.087
So, you are coming
to the party.

48:42.156 --> 48:44.163
Tell him to come to the party.

48:46.699 --> 48:48.488
That's mute for,

48:48.555 --> 48:50.246
"you must come."

48:50.348 --> 48:52.617
Oh, uh...
you have a tux?

49:00.267 --> 49:02.569
Your highness,
how wonderful to see you.

49:02.635 --> 49:04.490
Jane Childs from
the arts council.

49:04.555 --> 49:07.370
Miss Childs,
so nice to see you.

49:07.435 --> 49:09.769
These are my friends
Paul and Diane.

49:09.835 --> 49:11.144
How do you do?

49:11.212 --> 49:14.114
This is one of our
new South American sculptors.

49:14.187 --> 49:17.002
He's going to be
having a one-man show here.

49:20.331 --> 49:21.290
Thanks.

49:38.700 --> 49:40.522
Uh, shall we go?

49:40.587 --> 49:41.546
Coming, Paul?

49:42.892 --> 49:45.412
No? All right, then.

49:54.316 --> 49:56.650
Have you met
our mayor Mr. Cox?

49:56.715 --> 49:59.530
No, I haven't had the pleasure.

50:32.299 --> 50:33.674
Plaster cast mold,

50:33.739 --> 50:36.554
and then it was done
in the lost wax method,

50:36.587 --> 50:39.970
which is why it's so
anatomically correct.

50:40.044 --> 50:41.418
Excuse me, Your Highness.

50:41.483 --> 50:45.160
He's awfully good
with the ladies.

50:47.339 --> 50:51.049
A 2. Oh, deuces are wild.
I got the 2.

50:51.115 --> 50:53.002
Uh, the 3 is yours.

50:55.179 --> 50:59.107
Uh... the king is for me.

50:59.211 --> 51:01.066
Here's a 4.

51:01.131 --> 51:02.757
4 and, um...

51:02.859 --> 51:05.674
I'm sorry.
We can't do this.

51:13.003 --> 51:14.858
Could I talk to you?

51:25.003 --> 51:27.818
Uh, would you excuse me
for a minute?

51:27.883 --> 51:30.731
Ladies and gentlemen,
the auction is about to begin.

51:30.795 --> 51:33.129
Please join us at the forum.

51:55.884 --> 51:58.218
Prince Geoffrey
may be turning in

51:58.283 --> 51:59.657
his wicked, wicked ways

51:59.724 --> 52:02.342
for American monkey
psychiatrist Diane Farrow.

52:02.443 --> 52:05.345
Miss Farrow, who
as a comparative psychobiologist

52:05.451 --> 52:08.266
has had considerable
experience taming wild beasts,

52:08.331 --> 52:11.146
has tamed the untamable
king of the jungle

52:11.211 --> 52:12.585
Prince Geoffrey of York.

52:12.651 --> 52:14.823
As far as Buckingham Palace
is concerned,

52:14.891 --> 52:17.379
sources tell us
the queen mum is staying mum

52:17.451 --> 52:20.747
until she gets to meet
the pretty American psychologist.

52:26.379 --> 52:27.492
Hi.

52:27.564 --> 52:29.090
Hi.

52:29.163 --> 52:30.122
Guess what.

52:30.123 --> 52:31.082
What?

52:31.083 --> 52:32.993
Geoffrey proposed
to me last night.

52:33.067 --> 52:35.784
W-W-W-What'd
you tell him?

52:35.883 --> 52:38.982
I told him I would
think about it.

52:39.051 --> 52:40.425
Think about it.

52:40.491 --> 52:42.215
W-Why'd you
tell him that?

52:53.259 --> 52:54.666
You know...

52:55.979 --> 52:57.986
all my life,

52:58.059 --> 52:59.466
I've felt...

53:00.523 --> 53:01.603
ugly.

53:03.275 --> 53:07.072
And now I have
the world's most desirable man

53:07.147 --> 53:09.481
telling me that I am beautiful.

53:09.547 --> 53:13.290
I have the prince of England
at home pining for me.

53:13.355 --> 53:15.210
This is a dream come true.

53:15.275 --> 53:18.820
I could be a princess.

53:23.179 --> 53:24.456
You're disturbed.

53:26.219 --> 53:27.594
W-What causes this?

53:27.659 --> 53:31.041
Well, I haven't had
a date in four years.

53:38.891 --> 53:41.379
What?

53:41.483 --> 53:44.386
Uh, well, your... your...
the joke about the date.

53:44.491 --> 53:46.051
Well, what about it?

53:46.155 --> 53:50.563
Well, Diane...
we had a date.

53:50.635 --> 53:52.577
We had a date?

53:52.651 --> 53:54.626
Yeah. Remember?

53:54.699 --> 53:56.641
No, I don't.

53:56.715 --> 53:58.886
The lunch...
we went out to lunch.

53:58.955 --> 54:00.384
That was a date?

54:00.459 --> 54:02.401
Yeah.

54:02.475 --> 54:06.250
I thought a date was when
you went to somebody's house

54:06.315 --> 54:08.170
and you picked them up

54:08.235 --> 54:10.242
and you took them out
to dinner.

54:10.315 --> 54:12.649
Well, that is
a conventional date,

54:12.715 --> 54:15.649
but you... you don't
have to do that.

54:15.755 --> 54:17.129
Gosh, I'm sorry.

54:17.195 --> 54:19.399
I had no idea that
that was a date.

54:19.467 --> 54:22.850
Was there a second date
that I'm not aware of?

54:22.923 --> 54:26.567
No. Because you said you
had kind of a boyfriend.

54:26.635 --> 54:27.977
Oh.

54:29.355 --> 54:31.559
Well, he's not a boyfriend.

54:32.811 --> 54:34.022
No?

54:34.091 --> 54:35.105
No.

54:45.643 --> 54:47.018
Are you hungry?

54:48.043 --> 54:50.083
Yeah.

54:50.187 --> 54:54.410
Do you want to go out
and get something to eat?

54:54.475 --> 54:57.061
You know, I'll drive
to your house,

54:57.131 --> 54:58.505
and I'll pick you up and...

54:58.571 --> 55:00.164
talk to your father.

55:01.451 --> 55:03.306
So this is a date?

55:03.371 --> 55:04.745
This is definitely a date.

55:05.771 --> 55:06.818
O.K.

55:48.011 --> 55:50.280
And then something
magical happened.

55:50.379 --> 55:52.714
For the first time in my life,

55:52.779 --> 55:54.153
I felt something perfect.

55:54.219 --> 55:57.481
Once you feel that feeling,
that perfect feeling,

55:57.547 --> 55:59.882
you want it to last forever,

55:59.947 --> 56:02.762
but since love
comes with no guarantee,

56:02.827 --> 56:05.161
you do what you can do,

56:05.227 --> 56:05.893
and the only thing you can do

56:05.963 --> 56:07.337
is get married.

56:07.403 --> 56:09.924
So you plan
your moment carefully,

56:09.995 --> 56:13.311
making it as enticing
and romantic as possible.

56:13.387 --> 56:15.940
And if they accept, you marry

56:16.011 --> 56:18.596
and cross your fingers
and hope it lasts.

56:18.667 --> 56:22.945
I couldn't wait to spend
the rest of my life with Diane.

56:23.019 --> 56:25.354
I booked this great old
bed and breakfast

56:25.419 --> 56:27.688
on a bluff
overlooking the ocean.

56:27.755 --> 56:30.537
We'd go out
and watch the sunset...

Where are you?

58:20.394 --> 58:21.353
Hi.

58:21.354 --> 58:22.313
Hi.

58:24.234 --> 58:25.696
Where have you been?

58:25.771 --> 58:27.047
Huh?

58:27.114 --> 58:28.129
Paul...

58:29.194 --> 58:31.366
so much has happened.

58:31.466 --> 58:32.873
So much.

58:32.971 --> 58:34.051
Tell me.

58:35.146 --> 58:37.034
Well, um...

58:38.155 --> 58:39.114
last week...

58:40.075 --> 58:42.628
something happened between us.

58:42.699 --> 58:44.008
Uh-huh.

58:45.258 --> 58:47.200
Well, we became...

58:48.523 --> 58:49.930
friends.

58:49.995 --> 58:52.100
Friends?

58:52.171 --> 58:54.408
Yeah, I mean...

58:54.475 --> 58:57.290
it's important, isn't it,
to be... friends?

58:57.355 --> 59:00.170
Well, yeah, but, uh,
I mean, uh...

59:00.235 --> 59:04.032
I thought we became
more than friends.

59:06.443 --> 59:10.152
There's something
I think I should tell you.

59:10.218 --> 59:13.863
I've been seeing someone...

59:13.931 --> 59:19.201
off and on for about,
um, 10 years,

59:19.275 --> 59:21.063
and... and there
were problems.

59:21.130 --> 59:23.683
I mean, it never, never
really worked out,

59:23.754 --> 59:26.788
but all of a sudden,
it's like he's come around.

59:26.859 --> 59:27.939
He's changed.

59:28.010 --> 59:30.825
It's like a dream
come true for me.

59:30.890 --> 59:31.850
It's great.

59:31.915 --> 59:33.125
Gary...

59:37.643 --> 59:39.977
um, Gary, this is Paul.

59:40.043 --> 59:42.246
Paul, this is Gary.

59:51.339 --> 59:52.298
Paul...

59:54.667 --> 59:56.642
Paul, please, don't be upset.

59:58.251 --> 01:00:01.186
We can still be
friends, can't we?

01:00:10.539 --> 01:00:13.321
At first I was a mess,

01:00:13.387 --> 01:00:18.340
and then things just got worse.

01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:19.687
I couldn't eat.

01:00:19.755 --> 01:00:21.609
I couldn't sleep.

01:00:21.675 --> 01:00:23.682
I couldn't do anything
but think of Diane.

01:00:23.755 --> 01:00:27.137
I had no choice.
I had to get her back.

01:00:27.211 --> 01:00:28.837
I did what everybody does

01:00:28.907 --> 01:00:30.761
when they're in love
with somebody

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.681
who's in love
with somebody else...

01:00:32.747 --> 01:00:35.081
You pretend you're willing
to be just friends,

01:00:35.146 --> 01:00:37.480
but really you're out to sabotage
their relationship.

01:00:37.578 --> 01:00:41.091
I'd gently steer Diane into
the morass of Gary's many faults.

01:00:41.195 --> 01:00:42.755
Since I didn't know Gary,

01:00:42.859 --> 01:00:46.120
I had to find out what
exactly these faults were.

01:00:46.187 --> 01:00:48.521
So how's it with, uh, Gary?

01:00:48.586 --> 01:00:49.545
Gary's great.

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:50.920
He's a handsome guy.

01:00:50.987 --> 01:00:52.361
You think so?

01:00:52.426 --> 01:00:54.760
He looks great in a towel, too.

01:00:54.827 --> 01:00:57.161
He could be a big towel model.

01:00:57.226 --> 01:00:58.600
What's he like?

01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:01.733
I didn't really get
a chance to meet him.

01:01:01.803 --> 01:01:03.428
Well, um...

01:01:06.507 --> 01:01:09.322
can you imagine feeling
something with someone

01:01:09.418 --> 01:01:11.971
that just feels...
perfect?

01:01:12.075 --> 01:01:13.984
Yeah.

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:16.327
That's how I would
describe Gary.

01:01:16.394 --> 01:01:18.085
He's just... perfect.

01:01:18.154 --> 01:01:19.169
Perfect?

01:01:20.203 --> 01:01:21.894
Wow... perfect.

01:01:23.019 --> 01:01:26.434
Besides perfect,
w-what is he like?

01:01:26.507 --> 01:01:29.256
Well, he's, uh...

01:01:29.322 --> 01:01:31.657
he's kind of a perfectionist.

01:01:31.723 --> 01:01:35.018
So... So he's perfect,
and he's a perfectionist.

01:01:35.082 --> 01:01:36.041
So, yeah.

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:38.890
I mean...
but what does that mean?

01:01:38.955 --> 01:01:39.914
He's punctual?

01:01:39.915 --> 01:01:41.737
Well, he's, um...

01:01:41.835 --> 01:01:44.169
Oh, he's very resolute.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:47.202
He wants to do
what he wants to do.

01:01:47.306 --> 01:01:48.648
Is that good?

01:01:48.714 --> 01:01:50.372
Do you like that about him?

01:01:50.442 --> 01:01:52.133
Usually.

01:01:52.202 --> 01:01:53.576
Not always?

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.169
Well, it...

01:01:55.242 --> 01:01:59.017
Sometimes he just
likes to do things

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:01.766
that I... I really
don't like to do.

01:02:07.114 --> 01:02:08.969
Oh. I'm sorry.

01:02:10.283 --> 01:02:11.330
Hello?

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:13.321
Hi.

01:02:14.282 --> 01:02:17.097
Oh, I was just talking to Paul.

01:02:18.122 --> 01:02:20.097
Gary, we're just friends.

01:02:20.202 --> 01:02:21.893
Gary, I...

01:02:23.051 --> 01:02:24.098
O.K.

01:02:25.194 --> 01:02:26.153
O.K.

01:02:27.114 --> 01:02:28.707
I love you.

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:30.666
All right.

01:02:30.731 --> 01:02:32.105
I love you.

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:34.374
O.K. Bye.

01:02:38.219 --> 01:02:41.153
Gary doesn't want me
talking to you anymore.

01:02:43.146 --> 01:02:45.154
Diane, what do you want?

01:02:48.011 --> 01:02:50.345
I don't want to lose him.

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:51.784
I love him.

01:02:53.258 --> 01:02:55.560
Sorry.

01:02:55.626 --> 01:02:58.922
This plan was clearly
not going to work.

01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:01.354
Gary's influence
over Diane was too powerful.

01:03:01.419 --> 01:03:03.753
She'd do anything
to make him happy.

01:03:03.818 --> 01:03:07.364
It was like she'd joined
some kind of cult.

01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:13.706
I went from feeling I'd be
in love with Diane forever

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:18.048
to wondering if I'd ever fall
in love with anyone again.

01:03:18.123 --> 01:03:19.333
I would.

01:03:40.298 --> 01:03:41.509
Oh, hi.

01:03:42.699 --> 01:03:45.448
Hi. I was
in the area.

01:03:45.515 --> 01:03:48.329
I thought I'd stop
by and say hello.

01:03:48.395 --> 01:03:51.264
Oh, that was very nice of you.

01:03:51.371 --> 01:03:54.088
Uh... do you
want to come in?

01:03:55.115 --> 01:03:56.074
O.K.

01:04:07.659 --> 01:04:09.928
Can I use your bathroom?

01:04:58.346 --> 01:05:02.470
So, uh...
what is it you do again?

01:05:02.538 --> 01:05:04.065
Accountant or something?

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:16.105
There we go.

01:05:16.171 --> 01:05:17.545
So is that everything?

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:19.465
Yeah, this is the whole thing.

01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:20.905
Cables?

01:05:20.971 --> 01:05:23.305
The cables are in with
the instruction books.

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:24.745
Good job, buddy.

01:05:24.811 --> 01:05:26.698
You're coming right
back, right?

01:05:26.762 --> 01:05:27.721
You bet.

01:05:27.722 --> 01:05:29.610
O.K. Bye-bye.

01:05:31.562 --> 01:05:34.246
I gave her anything I had
of value,

01:05:34.314 --> 01:05:36.169
including all the love potion.

01:05:36.234 --> 01:05:38.655
I tried explaining how it
affects the pharyngeals,

01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:41.578
but this was clearly
a woman more interested

01:05:41.642 --> 01:05:43.944
in fiduciary gain
than in science.

01:05:44.011 --> 01:05:45.985
Great girl.

01:05:46.058 --> 01:05:49.703
For four hours, I could
think of nothing but Marisa...

01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:53.895
Beautiful, intelligent,
all-around wonderful gal Marisa.

01:05:53.963 --> 01:05:55.818
Then four hours later...

01:05:56.939 --> 01:05:58.280
I could've strangled her.

01:05:58.378 --> 01:06:00.745
I couldn't believe
how powerful an influence

01:06:00.842 --> 01:06:02.216
the potion had over me.

01:06:02.282 --> 01:06:04.999
I would've done anything
to make Marisa happy.

01:06:05.066 --> 01:06:08.841
It was like I had joined
some kind of cult.

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:13.636
You sold all of it,
the whole bottle?

01:06:13.706 --> 01:06:15.048
Yes.

01:06:15.114 --> 01:06:17.602
The person who bought this,
what did they look like?

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:21.384
Tall, very handsome,
dark eyes, dark hair.

01:06:21.451 --> 01:06:23.622
Did he wear a ring?

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:25.632
Yes.

01:06:25.706 --> 01:06:28.772
A gold snake with
rubies for eyes.

01:06:35.339 --> 01:06:36.298
Hello?

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:38.599
Diane, I just got back
from Madame Ruth's.

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:41.001
Gary is using
the potion on you.

01:06:41.066 --> 01:06:42.495
I'm in love with him.

01:06:42.571 --> 01:06:44.840
No, you're not.
Go away for four hours

01:06:44.906 --> 01:06:47.721
and see if you're still
in love with him.

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:49.160
Paul, this is ridiculous.

01:06:49.226 --> 01:06:52.041
Why does he make you take
the telephone everywhere?

01:06:52.106 --> 01:06:54.441
Does he call you
every four hours?

01:06:54.506 --> 01:06:57.321
He thinks you're using
the love potion on me.

01:06:57.386 --> 01:06:59.241
Don't tell him!
He's the enemy!

01:06:59.306 --> 01:07:01.095
Just hang up
the phone, Diane.

01:07:01.194 --> 01:07:03.529
He must have
found out about it.

01:07:03.594 --> 01:07:04.968
Did you write it down?

01:07:05.034 --> 01:07:06.409
I have to go.

01:07:06.474 --> 01:07:07.848
Hang up the phone.

01:07:07.914 --> 01:07:10.696
He must have read
your journal and...

01:07:16.875 --> 01:07:17.834
Diane.

01:07:17.835 --> 01:07:19.689
I'm not listening to you.

01:07:19.755 --> 01:07:22.569
I am not using it.
He is.

01:07:22.635 --> 01:07:24.009
It'll wear off someday,

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:27.009
and you'll be pregnant,
and you'll be married,

01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:28.937
and you'll have
that asshole's children.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:32.298
It'll wear off.
You'll be married to a man you hate

01:07:32.362 --> 01:07:34.378
with a bunch of little
assholes running around!

01:07:34.507 --> 01:07:35.750
I kept calling her,

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:38.306
but she wouldn't take my calls.

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:39.752
I wrote her letters,

01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:41.192
but they came back unanswered.

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:42.338
I tried confronting Gary.

01:07:43.562 --> 01:07:45.700
That didn't work.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.876
There was only one stone
left unturned.

01:07:47.947 --> 01:07:49.801
Do you have an antidote

01:07:49.867 --> 01:07:52.103
or something
more powerful or...

01:07:54.059 --> 01:07:55.073
Sit down.

01:08:41.514 --> 01:08:44.099
Years ago there was a plague.

01:08:45.642 --> 01:08:47.584
It affected many people.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:51.465
It did not in any way
make them feel ill.

01:08:51.529 --> 01:08:54.432
They lived long lives, but...

01:08:59.145 --> 01:09:01.513
something inside of them
died...

01:09:01.578 --> 01:09:03.966
The capacity to love forever.

01:09:05.482 --> 01:09:07.816
This is the cure.

01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:18.341
Love Potion Number Nine
does not create emotion.

01:09:18.443 --> 01:09:20.581
It purifies it.

01:09:20.649 --> 01:09:22.276
Love is often obscured

01:09:22.345 --> 01:09:26.819
by doubt, prejudice, suspicion.

01:09:28.522 --> 01:09:30.595
With number nine,

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:33.962
all that is eliminated.

01:09:34.026 --> 01:09:35.935
It becomes pure.

01:09:37.162 --> 01:09:39.649
The greatest tragedy in life

01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:41.576
is when love fades.

01:09:42.921 --> 01:09:45.737
With Love Potion Number Nine,

01:09:45.801 --> 01:09:47.176
it never fades.

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:51.618
So if you ever loved each other

01:09:51.721 --> 01:09:53.991
and you both take this potion,

01:09:54.058 --> 01:09:56.393
you will love each other again,

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:59.273
as much as you ever
loved each other...

01:09:59.338 --> 01:10:00.680
forever.

01:10:04.906 --> 01:10:07.906
Are you absolutely sure
she was in love with you?

01:10:07.978 --> 01:10:09.188
Uh...

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:12.233
mm-hmm.

01:10:13.482 --> 01:10:14.441
Why?

01:10:14.442 --> 01:10:16.384
If you both take this potion

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:18.792
and you were in love with her

01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:21.672
but she really never
was in love with you,

01:10:21.738 --> 01:10:25.033
you will love her for
the rest of your life,

01:10:25.098 --> 01:10:28.359
and she will hate you
for the rest of hers.

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:35.875
Great.

01:10:46.346 --> 01:10:48.201
How does it work?

01:10:49.322 --> 01:10:52.289
She said drink from
the same cup, then kiss.

01:10:52.394 --> 01:10:54.728
Five minutes later,
it will take effect.

01:10:54.794 --> 01:10:57.609
If your heart is willing and can
be pleased, wait and listen,

01:10:57.674 --> 01:11:00.293
and you'll hear a song
from the breeze.

01:11:00.362 --> 01:11:02.882
So if you're willing
to fall in love,

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:05.288
and five minutes
after the big smooch,

01:11:05.354 --> 01:11:07.209
you'll hear
this wind musical thing,

01:11:07.274 --> 01:11:09.730
and whoosh,
you're in love forever.

01:11:09.802 --> 01:11:13.381
If your heart is stubborn
like the heart of a fool,

01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:15.970
you will taste
the sweat of a mule.

01:11:16.042 --> 01:11:19.206
So if you're an asshole
and not willing to commit,

01:11:19.274 --> 01:11:21.129
then five minutes
after the kiss,

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.568
you'll taste mule sweat,

01:11:22.634 --> 01:11:23.911
which, I imagine, is terrible.

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:26.377
So if I take this potion
with Diane,

01:11:26.474 --> 01:11:28.329
I kiss her,
five minutes later...

01:11:28.394 --> 01:11:30.729
assuming that she's
still in love with me...

01:11:30.794 --> 01:11:32.649
number nine
will override number eight,

01:11:32.714 --> 01:11:35.048
no matter how much
Gary takes number eight.

01:11:35.114 --> 01:11:37.503
That's assuming
she's in love with me.

01:11:37.578 --> 01:11:39.138
Paul...

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:42.244
And this is the reason
why you guys are here...

01:11:42.314 --> 01:11:43.688
Diane's not talking to me,

01:11:43.754 --> 01:11:46.089
so she's not going to
willingly take the potion.

01:11:46.154 --> 01:11:47.528
I'm going to need your help.

01:11:47.594 --> 01:11:49.383
The plan is very simple.

01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:52.265
We go to her house,
I knock on the door...

01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:54.185
You guys wait on the foyer...

01:11:54.282 --> 01:11:57.064
If she answers, I burst in.
You guys follow.

01:11:57.130 --> 01:11:59.464
If she doesn't,
we knock down the door,

01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:01.919
grab her, hold her down,
I tickle her knee,

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:04.098
and her mouth will open.

01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:07.618
I force the potion in,
get her to swallow it.

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:10.505
I kiss her. Then we wait
for five minutes.

01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:12.425
Of course, getting her
to swallow

01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:15.305
is going to be
the toughest part

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:17.890
'cause, hey, you know,
women don't want to swallow.

01:12:17.962 --> 01:12:19.872
Sorry. Uh...

01:12:19.946 --> 01:12:22.280
Oh, also, if Gary is there,

01:12:22.346 --> 01:12:24.201
it's going to get physical,

01:12:24.266 --> 01:12:25.225
'cause, uh...

01:12:25.226 --> 01:12:27.299
But there are four of us,

01:12:27.402 --> 01:12:30.184
and I think we can take him...

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.104
unless he has a gun,

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:33.544
but chances are pretty remote.

01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:35.465
You guys have any questions?

01:12:37.962 --> 01:12:39.784
What? What?
What's with that look?

01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:41.159
You don't believe me?

01:12:41.226 --> 01:12:44.041
It's not a matter
of not believing you.

01:12:44.106 --> 01:12:45.535
It's just...

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:48.905
I think it is a matter
of not believing you.

01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:51.304
Not only that,
but you're asking us

01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:53.377
to break a number of laws...

01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:55.304
breaking and entering,
assault, battery.

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.890
Ron, do you believe me?

01:12:57.962 --> 01:13:00.777
I'd sooner believe
the Single Bullet Theory.

01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:11.201
Hold on.

01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:20.778
I'm running kind of low,
sweetheart.

01:13:20.842 --> 01:13:24.420
This Gary guy has the rest
of the potion, right?

01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:25.864
Yeah, that's right.

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:26.889
Great.

01:13:37.642 --> 01:13:39.017
Bye-bye, now.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.292
Bye-bye.

01:13:40.362 --> 01:13:41.922
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:13:48.906 --> 01:13:50.761
My God.

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.866
She's an angel.

01:13:52.938 --> 01:13:53.897
That bitch.

01:13:53.898 --> 01:13:56.713
She took my Rolex
and my wallet.

01:13:56.778 --> 01:13:58.152
Yes. Yes,
that's right.

01:13:58.217 --> 01:14:01.032
I'd like to report
a stolen Visa Card.

01:14:01.097 --> 01:14:02.057
Thank you.

01:14:03.786 --> 01:14:06.600
What am I going to tell Judy?

01:14:06.666 --> 01:14:09.000
Tell her you're a schmuck.

01:14:09.066 --> 01:14:12.295
You guys going
to help me now or what?

01:14:22.026 --> 01:14:24.840
Remember. What do you
do if Marisa shows up?

01:14:24.906 --> 01:14:27.240
Beat the living shit
out of her.

01:14:27.306 --> 01:14:29.640
Cover your ears.
Yell and scream.

01:14:29.706 --> 01:14:30.665
Don't listen to her.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:32.520
What if Gary shows up?

01:14:32.586 --> 01:14:34.920
Beat the living shit
out of him.

01:14:35.018 --> 01:14:36.065
Good.

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:37.249
Shh.

01:14:40.178 --> 01:14:41.137
Hi.

01:14:41.161 --> 01:14:42.120
Hello.

01:14:42.121 --> 01:14:43.550
Are you Diane's friend?

01:14:43.658 --> 01:14:45.513
- Yeah. Who are you?
- Paul.

01:14:45.578 --> 01:14:46.854
You're the Paul she works with?

01:14:46.921 --> 01:14:47.880
Yeah.

01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:50.664
The one she hit it off with?

01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:52.518
She told me not to talk to you.

01:14:52.585 --> 01:14:55.400
There's something strange
going on here, isn't there?

01:14:55.465 --> 01:14:56.840
Yes, there is.

01:14:56.906 --> 01:14:59.328
Suddenly she's dating
the prince of England,

01:14:59.401 --> 01:15:01.256
then she's crazy about you,

01:15:01.321 --> 01:15:03.296
now she's marrying the schmuck.

01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:04.744
Marrying?
She's marrying him?

01:15:04.809 --> 01:15:05.889
- Yes.
- When?

01:15:05.962 --> 01:15:07.271
In about an hour.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:08.483
Oh, Jesus.

01:15:08.586 --> 01:15:11.783
She forgot this
in all the excitement.

01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:13.279
Uh, hi.

01:15:14.346 --> 01:15:15.720
What's happening here?

01:15:15.786 --> 01:15:17.957
Would you like me to tell you?

01:15:18.026 --> 01:15:20.841
You get her to drink
from the glass,

01:15:20.906 --> 01:15:23.328
then bring the glass
back to me.

01:15:23.401 --> 01:15:26.336
I'll sip from it,
come in, and kiss her.

01:15:32.842 --> 01:15:35.657
So this guy Gary, is he big?

01:15:35.722 --> 01:15:36.769
Yeah.

01:15:40.138 --> 01:15:42.952
Now, you said that she
was crazy about me.

01:15:43.018 --> 01:15:45.832
Is that the word
she used, crazy?

01:15:45.898 --> 01:15:47.272
Yes.

01:15:47.338 --> 01:15:51.593
Did she ever say that
she was in love with me?

01:15:51.658 --> 01:15:53.512
Did she use that word?

01:15:53.578 --> 01:15:54.984
No. She said crazy.

01:15:58.282 --> 01:16:00.703
If your heart is decisive

01:16:00.778 --> 01:16:03.112
and your heart can be pleased,

01:16:03.178 --> 01:16:04.552
wait and listen.

01:16:04.618 --> 01:16:08.131
You will hear
a song from the breeze.

01:16:08.202 --> 01:16:09.347
Oh, great.

01:16:09.418 --> 01:16:10.792
This is great.

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:11.719
Oh, O.K.

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.672
Now, it is a tradition

01:16:13.738 --> 01:16:16.552
for the bride
and the matron of honor

01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:17.577
to drink champagne

01:16:17.578 --> 01:16:19.432
out of each other's glasses.

01:16:19.498 --> 01:16:20.457
It is?

01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:21.417
It is?

01:16:21.418 --> 01:16:22.377
It is.

01:16:22.378 --> 01:16:24.766
It's sort of an Irish thing.

01:16:24.841 --> 01:16:26.630
Did you know that?

01:16:26.698 --> 01:16:27.657
No.

01:16:27.658 --> 01:16:29.032
Well, uh, pour.

01:16:29.098 --> 01:16:30.472
Grandma.

01:16:30.538 --> 01:16:31.497
O.K.

01:16:31.498 --> 01:16:32.457
Um...

01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:39.237
Here.

01:16:39.306 --> 01:16:41.640
O.K. Now, hold
your glass up

01:16:41.706 --> 01:16:43.080
really nice and high.

01:16:43.178 --> 01:16:44.291
O.K.

01:16:44.393 --> 01:16:47.208
And... to Diane

01:16:47.273 --> 01:16:48.648
and... whoever.

01:16:48.714 --> 01:16:49.673
Gary.

01:16:49.674 --> 01:16:50.633
Right.

01:16:51.594 --> 01:16:54.277
You look beautiful.

01:16:54.345 --> 01:16:55.392
Mmm.

01:16:55.465 --> 01:16:57.473
Gary, get out of here!

01:16:59.145 --> 01:17:02.440
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride

01:17:02.506 --> 01:17:04.000
before the wedding.

01:17:04.074 --> 01:17:05.928
Well, then,

01:17:05.994 --> 01:17:08.361
here's to bad luck.

01:17:18.409 --> 01:17:21.224
There is something you can do.

01:17:21.289 --> 01:17:24.104
You must drink
from the same glass,

01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:25.151
then kiss her.

01:17:25.225 --> 01:17:27.527
Drink from
the same glass, then kiss her?

01:17:27.593 --> 01:17:28.967
She will fall in love

01:17:29.034 --> 01:17:30.888
with the man she loved most

01:17:30.954 --> 01:17:32.328
and hate the other forever,

01:17:32.393 --> 01:17:35.524
but if you wait too long,
it won't work.

01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:50.569
Hmm...

01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:51.529
No...

01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:52.489
Whoa...

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:53.635
No...

01:17:53.706 --> 01:17:54.665
Aah!

01:17:54.666 --> 01:17:55.625
Aah!

01:17:55.626 --> 01:17:56.585
Back up.

01:17:56.586 --> 01:17:57.545
Oh!

01:17:58.506 --> 01:17:59.880
Just get out.

01:17:59.945 --> 01:18:00.904
No!

01:18:00.905 --> 01:18:02.760
O.K., move.
I'll crack this...

01:18:02.825 --> 01:18:04.200
Put it down!

01:18:04.266 --> 01:18:05.640
Just step aside.
Diane...

01:18:05.705 --> 01:18:07.778
Oh, God!

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.890
Diane. Diane.

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:17.864
Mmm!

01:18:17.929 --> 01:18:19.784
Look, fellas,
I... I... I...

01:18:19.849 --> 01:18:21.224
I'm not crazy,
O.K.?

01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:22.664
I'm not insane.

01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:25.795
Mmm, oh, no!

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.821
Hello, Gary.

01:18:30.890 --> 01:18:33.639
Now, listen.
I know you're in a hurry

01:18:33.706 --> 01:18:36.095
to get married,

01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:38.504
so let's skip the small talk.

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:40.610
You've got something I want.

01:18:43.914 --> 01:18:45.321
Oh.

01:18:48.874 --> 01:18:50.565
It's so...

01:18:50.634 --> 01:18:51.648
thick.

01:18:51.721 --> 01:18:54.209
You're supposed to dilute it.

01:18:56.554 --> 01:18:59.172
Completely pure?

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:09.094
If your heart is stubborn

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.528
like the heart of a fool,

01:19:11.593 --> 01:19:12.968
you'll wait, hear nothing,

01:19:13.034 --> 01:19:15.849
but taste the sweat
of the mule.

01:19:15.914 --> 01:19:16.873
What?

01:19:16.874 --> 01:19:18.467
What are you doing?

01:19:26.922 --> 01:19:28.132
Stop!

01:19:29.258 --> 01:19:30.436
Gary.

01:19:32.938 --> 01:19:35.174
Let me do this.

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.312
Gary, don't!

01:19:38.377 --> 01:19:39.621
Stop!

01:19:47.369 --> 01:19:48.744
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:51.849 --> 01:19:53.376
Come on.

01:19:56.905 --> 01:19:58.945
If any present knows any reason

01:19:59.018 --> 01:20:01.735
why they may not lawfully
be joined in marriage,

01:20:01.801 --> 01:20:03.524
let them speak now

01:20:03.594 --> 01:20:05.448
or forever hold their peace.

01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:39.808
Yecchh!

01:20:39.882 --> 01:20:41.223
Yecchh!

01:20:43.913 --> 01:20:45.288
Do you, Diane Farrow,

01:20:45.386 --> 01:20:48.681
take this man to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

01:20:48.745 --> 01:20:50.600
in sickness and in health,

01:20:50.665 --> 01:20:53.632
as long as you both shall live?

01:20:53.705 --> 01:20:55.199
I do.

01:20:56.233 --> 01:20:57.248
The ring.

01:21:33.673 --> 01:21:35.429
Excuse me.

01:21:43.625 --> 01:21:45.665
What's going on?

01:21:45.737 --> 01:21:47.842
You bitch!

01:21:47.913 --> 01:21:49.888
You god damn whore!

01:21:49.993 --> 01:21:51.171

01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:55.944
You bitch!

01:22:18.089 --> 01:22:19.048
Jesus Christ!

01:22:19.049 --> 01:22:21.864
Uh, guys, we got
a major code 29

01:22:21.961 --> 01:22:22.920
right outside.

01:22:24.266 --> 01:22:25.225
Everybody out!

01:22:25.226 --> 01:22:26.567
Get with it, guys!

01:22:28.553 --> 01:22:29.764

to your nose.

01:27:07.081 --> 01:27:09.502
Hop on one foot.

01:27:09.609 --> 01:27:11.943
Put your hands in the air

01:27:12.009 --> 01:27:12.968
and go...

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:18.340

real hard.

01:27:21.225 --> 01:27:24.127

Now I think it's time
for a little magic.

01:28:01.449 --> 01:28:03.783
Well, I'd like to tell you

01:28:03.849 --> 01:28:06.599
that five minutes
after I kissed Diane,

01:28:06.665 --> 01:28:09.480
she came running out
into my arms

01:28:09.545 --> 01:28:12.360
and that we fell in love
forever,

01:28:12.425 --> 01:28:14.400
but that's not what happened.

01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:17.480
It took six minutes.

01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:30.211
I'm sorry.

01:28:33.993 --> 01:28:36.327
It's all right.

01:28:36.393 --> 01:28:38.248
