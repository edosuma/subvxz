I've been saying it ever since we hit this mudball,

02:23.356 --> 02:24.690
we're all gonna die.

02:24.790 --> 02:26.289
We're not scrap yet.

02:49.494 --> 02:52.595
The moon. It's gone.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.328
The aliens have destroyed it.

02:55.428 --> 02:58.062
Don't. It was never a moon.

02:58.162 --> 03:00.028
And it's far from gone.

( ominous theme playing )

03:26.800 --> 03:28.767
What is it?

03:28.867 --> 03:33.068
I'd say it was the instrument of our destruction.

03:33.168 --> 03:36.402
Impressive. Yes.

03:36.502 --> 03:38.335
What do we do?

03:38.435 --> 03:40.702
Seal the base and charge all shields.

03:40.802 --> 03:42.636
I will see to the rest.

03:42.736 --> 03:45.870
Computer, activate program "Zero Hour."

03:45.970 --> 03:49.804
COMPUTER: Activating. Scanning for transwarp signature.

03:49.904 --> 03:51.437
Now we'll see if my faith

03:51.537 --> 03:54.138
in Tarantulas' abilities is justified.

03:54.238 --> 03:58.105
COMPUTER: Signature located. Establishing position.

Oh, yes.

Perfect.

04:31.811 --> 04:34.677
COMPUTER: Transwarp drive functioning at tolerable levels.

Force shields at 55 percent.

04:36.779 --> 04:39.712
Excellent.

04:39.812 --> 04:42.246
It's a bit small for both of us.

04:42.346 --> 04:45.579
Of course, it could be kind of romantic.

04:45.679 --> 04:48.046
No, this planet will be extinguished

04:48.147 --> 04:49.547

( dramatic theme playing )

06:28.230 --> 06:30.164
The shield's down!

06:30.264 --> 06:33.297
And unless my opticals are malfunctioning,

06:33.397 --> 06:35.831
so is one of the moons.

06:35.931 --> 06:39.365
Rhinox said something was happening out there.

06:40.899 --> 06:43.032

06:43.132 --> 06:45.200
Cheetor and Tigatron are coming.

06:45.299 --> 06:46.599
Oh, terrific.

06:46.699 --> 06:50.001
Now we can all get reduced to hot burning slag together.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.201
BOTH: Shut up, Rattrap!

06:52.301 --> 06:54.301
( dramatic theme playing )

06:58.169 --> 07:01.235
Uh-uh-uh. Mustn't touch.

07:08.437 --> 07:09.503
( screams then grunts )

07:09.603 --> 07:12.304
So you're still functional.

07:12.404 --> 07:15.438
I'll soon remedy that mistake.

Don't count on it...

07:37.542 --> 07:38.708
Huh?

07:38.809 --> 07:41.209
Ant breath.

07:41.309 --> 07:42.776
Hyah!

07:47.444 --> 07:49.444
( laughing )

07:54.111 --> 07:56.578
( yells )

07:59.845 --> 08:02.479
That'll teach you to back shoot a Widow.

08:07.146 --> 08:09.513
Oh, poor Tarantulas.

08:09.613 --> 08:11.613
More to the point, poor me.

08:11.713 --> 08:16.382
If he was right, this planet is about to go boom.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.415
Sorry about this partner,

08:20.515 --> 08:24.016
but I need your data tracks to finish that ship.

09:02.622 --> 09:05.789
Rhinox? Dinobot?

09:05.889 --> 09:09.091
Oh, great, the planet's about to get zorched,

09:09.190 --> 09:11.957
and those two are on a positron break.

09:15.558 --> 09:17.991
AIRAZOR: Huh?

09:18.092 --> 09:19.425
Optimus!

09:19.525 --> 09:21.525
RATTRAP: The spiders.

09:21.625 --> 09:24.992
Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse.

09:25.092 --> 09:26.493
Tigatron, Cheetor,

09:26.593 --> 09:29.327
get Dinobot and Rhinox to the R chamber, quickly.

09:29.427 --> 09:32.060
Rattrap, you and Airazor search the base.

09:32.160 --> 09:35.794
Our Predacon visitors might still be here.

09:35.894 --> 09:38.328
So let Sentinel handle 'em.

09:38.428 --> 09:40.162
We can't spare the power.

09:41.962 --> 09:44.629
So I get to do it the hard way.

09:44.729 --> 09:46.297
As usual.

09:47.696 --> 09:49.063
Let's hit it.

09:49.163 --> 09:50.931
One more thing.

09:51.031 --> 09:52.964
If you find them,

09:53.064 --> 09:54.864
I want them functional.

09:54.964 --> 09:58.932
Eh, you just have to spoil my fun, don't you?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.032

10:07.233 --> 10:10.167

10:11.533 --> 10:14.634
So Tarantulas' plan proceeds.

10:14.734 --> 10:16.301
He must have-- SCORPONOK: Megatron!

10:16.401 --> 10:18.268
The alien machine.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.368

All available power to shields.

Shields holding.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.440
By the matrix, no!

10:49.540 --> 10:52.373
They're going to ignite the energon deposits.

10:52.474 --> 10:54.475
( dramatic theme playing )

11:18.479 --> 11:21.278
Brilliant. They're causing a chain reaction,

11:21.378 --> 11:23.413
which will rip this planet to atoms

11:23.512 --> 11:25.680
and destroy all traces of them.

11:25.780 --> 11:28.947
Simply to deal with us.

11:29.047 --> 11:30.713
What sheer ruthlessness.

11:30.813 --> 11:33.747
What disregard for sentient life.

11:33.848 --> 11:36.548
I rather like these aliens.

11:36.647 --> 11:39.982
Like them? They're trying to destroy us!

11:40.082 --> 11:42.782
Waspinator not want to be destroyed.

11:42.882 --> 11:45.950
Waspinator has plans.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.117
Megatron will save us.

11:48.217 --> 11:50.317
I think not.

11:50.417 --> 11:53.517
I've reserved that task for Tarantulas.

11:53.617 --> 11:55.751
Computer, reestablish signal.

All systems online.

12:26.556 --> 12:28.857
It's ready. We--

12:28.957 --> 12:31.757
I did it.

12:31.857 --> 12:33.791
Hooray for you.

12:35.891 --> 12:38.892
Did you know we have a truce?

12:42.359 --> 12:45.726
COMPUTER: External temperature at 300 rads and climbing.

12:45.826 --> 12:48.726
Modulate shields as necessary.

12:53.061 --> 12:55.127
Leaping lasers!

12:55.228 --> 12:57.495
How long before Rhinox is functional?

12:57.595 --> 12:59.095
At least a mega-cycle.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.162
He took a pretty big dose of cyber venom.

13:07.863 --> 13:10.630
Ugh. Not enough time.

13:10.730 --> 13:13.164
Rattrap to Optimus.

13:13.264 --> 13:14.664
Optimus here.

13:14.764 --> 13:17.731
Get down to the stasis hold quick, fearless leader.

13:17.831 --> 13:21.232
There's something here you gotta see.

13:21.332 --> 13:22.966
Incredible.

13:23.066 --> 13:25.199
It just might fly.

13:25.299 --> 13:27.900
Of course it'll fly, you ape.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.600
But it won't do you any good.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.067
The systems will only respond to me.

13:32.167 --> 13:35.101
Then change them to respond to me.

13:35.201 --> 13:37.702
Dream on, Captain Hairball.

13:37.801 --> 13:39.401
Computer, projection.

13:39.502 --> 13:43.269
COMPUTER: Planetary destruction in 22.5 cycles.

13:43.369 --> 13:45.970
I hate to put a bug in the program,

13:46.070 --> 13:48.070
but Tarantulas didn't build this thing

13:48.170 --> 13:50.337
to duke it out with a planet-buster.

13:50.437 --> 13:52.337
Every one of these alien structures

13:52.437 --> 13:55.438
have been designed for a specific purpose, Rattrap.

13:55.538 --> 13:56.872
This one is busy.

13:56.971 --> 13:59.239
And I'm betting I can fly close enough to take it out.

13:59.338 --> 14:03.739
With what? One of your famous "We can do it" speeches?

14:03.839 --> 14:06.106
A transwarp explosion.

14:06.206 --> 14:07.906
( dramatic theme playing )

14:08.006 --> 14:11.440
Ha, ha. You'll blow yourself to atoms.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.474
( laughing )

14:13.574 --> 14:16.241
If it saves this planet, it'll be worth it.

14:16.341 --> 14:19.975
If not, I'm no worse off.

14:20.075 --> 14:24.243
Either way, it's the only chance any of us have right now.

14:24.343 --> 14:26.343
( gasps )

14:28.343 --> 14:30.444
Unhand me, pussycats.

14:30.543 --> 14:33.844
I've got work to do.

14:33.944 --> 14:35.978
You can't do this, big bot.

14:36.078 --> 14:37.278
I'll fly the ship.

14:37.378 --> 14:38.911
No, let me.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.912
I owe this world.

14:41.012 --> 14:43.579
I'm grateful, but only a flyer

14:43.678 --> 14:45.679
has a chance of getting clear of the blast.

14:45.779 --> 14:48.746
Exactly why I'm the one to go.

14:50.213 --> 14:51.747
What about you, Rattrap?

14:51.847 --> 14:54.981
Hey, suicide ain't in my job description.

14:55.081 --> 14:57.248
Hm, or mine.

14:57.348 --> 15:00.282
Now start rigging an auto-charge in that transwarp cell.

15:00.382 --> 15:02.982
I'll need about 30 nano-clicks to clear the ship.

15:03.082 --> 15:04.983
You got it.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.083

15:16.317 --> 15:18.484
In you go.

15:23.986 --> 15:25.553

15:25.652 --> 15:28.486
Cozy. Just like a coffin.

15:28.586 --> 15:31.387
( growling )

15:31.487 --> 15:34.021
You realize this is crazy.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.054
Sometimes crazy works.

15:37.154 --> 15:39.154
Thanks for your help.

15:39.255 --> 15:41.288
Hmph, better you than me.

15:41.388 --> 15:43.389
( dramatic theme playing )

15:46.222 --> 15:47.890
Take care, Optimus.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.656
Come back to us.

15:49.756 --> 15:53.690
May the matrix protect your spark for all eternity.

15:55.724 --> 15:59.791
Eh, just in case you don't come back,

15:59.892 --> 16:01.459
can I have your quarters?

16:01.559 --> 16:04.292
No. Whatever happens out there,

16:04.392 --> 16:07.026
I want you to know that you're the finest crew

16:07.126 --> 16:09.026
I've ever served with.

16:12.094 --> 16:16.427
Ugh, do Maximals always talk such slop?

16:16.528 --> 16:19.228
( grunts )

16:19.328 --> 16:22.061
My sentiments exactly.

16:22.161 --> 16:24.162
( dramatic theme playing )

17:11.837 --> 17:14.137
Well, by the pit,

17:14.237 --> 17:16.237
the command codes have been changed.

17:16.337 --> 17:18.905
Optimus is flying the ship.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.872
How delicious. Yes.

17:21.971 --> 17:24.605
Come on, come on.

17:24.705 --> 17:25.805
Got it!

17:25.906 --> 17:27.172
There's big bot.

17:27.273 --> 17:29.640
How'd you get a signal through the shields?

17:29.740 --> 17:32.507
I opened a hole big enough for a spectrum pulse.

17:32.607 --> 17:34.774
Rhinox showed me how.

17:34.874 --> 17:37.141
I wish he was here.

17:37.241 --> 17:41.675
COMPUTER: Podship will close with objective in 15.7 seconds.

17:43.975 --> 17:46.809
Optimus.

17:46.910 --> 17:48.910
( dramatic theme playing )

18:00.578 --> 18:02.078
Nearly there.

18:02.178 --> 18:04.646
And no sign of any defense yet.

18:04.746 --> 18:08.647
He's closing in. Computer, how much time?

18:08.746 --> 18:12.380
COMPUTER: Planetary destruction in 5.3 cycles.

18:12.480 --> 18:16.214
Oh, man. Leave it to the monkey to take it to the wire.

18:16.314 --> 18:19.415
COMPUTER: Alien construct in range.

18:19.514 --> 18:21.749
Let's do it.

18:21.849 --> 18:23.482
Commence ignition sequence.

18:23.582 --> 18:27.683
COMPUTER: Commencing ignition in 60 nano-clicks.

18:28.950 --> 18:30.883
Prepare to blow podhatch.

18:30.983 --> 18:34.050
Unable to comply. Podhatch is magna-sealed.

18:34.150 --> 18:36.051
That's impossible.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.251
MEGATRON: Oh, I assure you it is not.

18:41.351 --> 18:42.685
Megatron?

18:42.785 --> 18:45.419
Hm, ironic, isn't it?

18:45.519 --> 18:48.452
Both of us hitting upon the same plan

18:48.553 --> 18:50.320
to destroy the alien machine.

18:50.420 --> 18:54.587
Fortunately, in my version, the pilot goes down.

18:54.687 --> 18:57.655
Or should I say "up" with the ship?

18:57.755 --> 18:59.755
( dramatic theme playing )

19:06.589 --> 19:09.123
He's almost inside the alien structure.

19:09.223 --> 19:10.823
Why doesn't he ditch?

19:10.924 --> 19:14.157
Oh, come on, fearless leader. Get it in gear.

19:14.257 --> 19:15.457
Too late.

19:15.558 --> 19:17.591
Goodbye, Optimus.

19:17.691 --> 19:20.425
( laughing )

19:20.525 --> 19:22.225
( dramatic theme playing )

19:22.325 --> 19:24.092
Oh, you Optimuses do love

19:24.192 --> 19:26.026
to sacrifice yourselves, don't you?

19:26.126 --> 19:28.893
Fortunately, this time your foolishness

19:28.993 --> 19:32.494
will destroy you and your Maximals.

19:32.594 --> 19:35.727
The Beast Wars are over, Optimus.

19:35.827 --> 19:39.228
You lose.

19:39.328 --> 19:41.028
COMPUTER: Ten, nine, eight...

19:41.128 --> 19:43.162
( laughing )

19:43.262 --> 19:47.496
COMPUTER: Seven, six... OPTIMUS: No!

19:47.596 --> 19:51.564
COMPUTER: Five, four... OPTIMUS: Megatron!

19:51.664 --> 19:54.530
Three, two...

19:54.630 --> 19:57.765
one, zero.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.801

20:47.339 --> 20:50.340
