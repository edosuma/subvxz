WEBVTT

00:04.680 --> 00:06.442
- Nietzche once said,

00:06.478 --> 00:09.080
"The secret of reaping
the greatest fruitfulness

00:09.115 --> 00:11.618
and the greatest
enjoyment from life

00:11.653 --> 00:13.252
is to live dangerously."

00:14.618 --> 00:17.355
He would've loved it here
on the Eastern Front.

00:59.063 --> 01:00.662
- Proceed, Proceed.

01:32.328 --> 01:34.663
- Comrade Stalin orders you!

01:36.604 --> 01:37.605
- Up there.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.936
Get to the trench, now!

01:38.972 --> 01:41.406
Put them out of there, go!

02:33.223 --> 02:35.196
- Prepare yourselves.

02:36.258 --> 02:38.126
Here they come.

03:01.518 --> 03:02.756
- Headquarters, we
need to break out.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.387
We need reinforcements!

03:04.422 --> 03:05.790
We've been waiting
for over an hour!

03:05.826 --> 03:06.793
Where are they?

03:10.294 --> 03:11.432
- Watch out for the plane.

03:11.467 --> 03:12.299
- Cover.

03:18.773 --> 03:19.770
- Here they come.

03:19.805 --> 03:20.637
Fire!

03:22.005 --> 03:23.810
Fire!

03:27.249 --> 03:29.782
- Headquarters,
need to break out.

03:33.485 --> 03:35.854
- Achtung, they're
coming from the tree,

03:35.890 --> 03:37.756
from the tree line.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.214
- Where are they?

04:35.484 --> 04:37.312
- You know, this reminds me
of that night in Hamburg.

04:37.348 --> 04:39.782
You know, the two sisters?

04:42.890 --> 04:43.924
- The blondes?

04:43.959 --> 04:45.254
- I thought they were brunettes.

04:45.289 --> 04:46.824
We were a little drunk.

04:46.860 --> 04:47.757
- Always.

04:49.090 --> 04:51.227
- We wanted to build a
campfire and have Schnapps

04:51.263 --> 04:52.864
for the two girls we met.

04:52.899 --> 04:53.763
It was dark.

04:54.964 --> 04:59.565
Lit the campfire in the
mayor's backyard.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.438
- Just your luck.

05:01.473 --> 05:03.773
- The luck was, he
was their father.

05:08.313 --> 05:09.213
- Those were good times.

05:09.248 --> 05:11.979
- Oh, '38 was a great year.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.382
- We did so much.

05:16.418 --> 05:17.490
- We did indeed.

05:19.525 --> 05:21.395
- Do you ever think
we'll make it home?

05:24.694 --> 05:28.633
- Yes, we will
absolutely make it home.

05:31.537 --> 05:33.999
20 years from now, I
will sit in my house

05:34.034 --> 05:38.340
in Flensburg with my
beautiful grandchildren

05:38.375 --> 05:39.642
and tell them stories.

05:39.677 --> 05:41.811
- What are you gonna
tell them about this?

05:43.985 --> 05:45.912
- Not a damn thing.

05:45.948 --> 05:49.456
I will tell them about
camaraderie, soldiering,

05:50.424 --> 05:52.888
the bands, the music,
and maybe the girls.

05:52.924 --> 05:55.825
I'm not telling them a damn
thing about the Russians.

05:56.693 --> 05:57.992
- So you're going
to lie to them?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.166
- Yes.

06:01.201 --> 06:02.365
I don't think they'll appreciate

06:02.400 --> 06:05.001
the truth of this, do you, Daug?

06:05.036 --> 06:05.868
- No.

06:07.405 --> 06:09.773
I know I wouldn't want to.

06:26.894 --> 06:27.721
- Captain.

06:27.757 --> 06:29.556
- What
the hell is that?

06:29.591 --> 06:30.860
- Goliath.

06:31.726 --> 06:32.798
- Morning, Sergeant.

06:32.834 --> 06:33.794
- Captain.

06:33.829 --> 06:35.460
- They brought them
in this morning.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.297
Worthless.

06:36.332 --> 06:37.135
- Good luck.

06:37.170 --> 06:37.999
- Thank you.

06:45.013 --> 06:45.875
- What are you doing?

06:48.350 --> 06:50.250
- I thought it was
time for a cigarette.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.079
- You know how bad
those are for you?

06:53.648 --> 06:54.814
- You're probably right.

06:54.850 --> 06:55.951
- They haven't
done him any good.

06:57.789 --> 06:59.520
- They keep sending us
people like Steinbeck,

06:59.555 --> 07:00.824
what are we gonna do?

07:01.791 --> 07:02.892
- Get ready for
the next quarter.

07:11.470 --> 07:13.400
- Good
morning, doctor.

07:13.436 --> 07:14.868
- Good morning.

07:14.903 --> 07:16.370
- How
are you holding up?

07:16.406 --> 07:17.640
- Not very good.

07:17.675 --> 07:19.739
- How many did you
lose this morning?

07:19.774 --> 07:21.174
- Do you really want to know?

07:25.052 --> 07:26.916
- No, not really.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.421
- Look how young they are.

07:30.457 --> 07:32.152
They're getting
younger every day.

07:34.963 --> 07:36.290
- I understand.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.157
- 16.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.563
- High Command say there's
a relief column on the way.

07:42.599 --> 07:43.933
- I've heard this before.

07:45.641 --> 07:48.971
- They should break in this
morning, tonight, tomorrow.

07:50.271 --> 07:52.271
- I don't think we're
gonna hold out that long.

07:54.977 --> 07:57.177
- I will get you out
of here, I promise.

07:58.185 --> 07:59.619
- I hope so.

08:04.486 --> 08:05.284
- Excuse me.

08:13.865 --> 08:17.036
Now, what did you
promise mother not to do?

08:17.071 --> 08:18.664
- Not to get shot.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.499
- What did you do?

08:19.535 --> 08:20.574
- I got shot.

08:21.938 --> 08:24.108
You know, you always
say girls love scars.

08:24.143 --> 08:25.205
So I did it.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.474
- I'm never gonna
hear the end of this.

08:27.510 --> 08:28.307
- You know it.

08:31.813 --> 08:33.620
So are we still winning the war?

08:34.617 --> 08:35.681
- Oh, most gloriously.

08:35.717 --> 08:36.953
Haven't you noticed?

08:37.821 --> 08:40.759
- So the noise I
hear, it's not ours?

08:42.929 --> 08:46.996
- Nope, but they have promised
to break us out any moment.

08:55.373 --> 08:56.803
- You know what?

08:56.838 --> 08:58.645
If the Russians comes closer,

08:58.680 --> 09:01.948
I'm gonna pack up the nurse
and crawl out of here,

09:01.984 --> 09:03.144
trust me Klaus.

09:03.179 --> 09:06.113
- You find a nurse around
here, I'll crawl with you.

09:06.149 --> 09:09.018
- I guess you don't come
to the rear much, do you?

09:10.092 --> 09:11.251
We have one right there.

09:16.161 --> 09:17.026
- What?

09:19.662 --> 09:21.261
- Son, can you hear me?

09:22.602 --> 09:23.500
- What the hell
is she doing here?

09:23.535 --> 09:25.097
What is a woman doing here?

09:25.133 --> 09:28.341
- Well, well, she
was a radio operator

09:28.377 --> 09:30.972
and she had some
medical training,

09:31.008 --> 09:34.212
so she decided to stay
when the trains left.

09:34.248 --> 09:35.845
That was a week ago.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.083
- You know what the
Russians will do to her?

09:38.119 --> 09:39.614
- Yeah, we know.

09:39.649 --> 09:41.382
I know, and she does.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.249
- Shit.

09:48.230 --> 09:49.490
- Captain, you look tired.

09:49.526 --> 09:50.726
Are you well?

09:50.762 --> 09:52.060
- Well the captain
is always tired,

09:52.096 --> 09:53.500
but you know, he's very
surprised to see you here.

09:53.535 --> 09:55.030
- Someone had to take
care of the wounded.

09:55.065 --> 09:57.262
There's a small sacrifice
for my country so--

09:57.298 --> 10:00.370
- Please don't give me
the Fatherland speech,

10:00.406 --> 10:01.708
not here in Russia.

10:02.871 --> 10:04.673
How long have you been here?

10:04.708 --> 10:06.304
- I volunteered seven weeks ago.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.878
- Do you have any idea
what will happen to you

10:08.913 --> 10:11.347
if the Russians break
through our lines?

10:11.383 --> 10:12.283
- I am aware.

10:12.319 --> 10:14.087
- Klaus, she's here.

10:14.122 --> 10:15.117
Just get her out.

10:18.127 --> 10:19.558
- What's your name?

10:19.593 --> 10:21.662
- My name is Gudrun
Herr Captain.

10:23.298 --> 10:24.460
- Where are you from, Gudrun?

10:24.496 --> 10:26.398
- I am from Berlin.

10:26.433 --> 10:28.064
Look, I appreciate your concern.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.298
I insist you let me stay to
take care of the wounded.

10:32.739 --> 10:35.274
- Gudrun, I don't
know if you're aware,

10:35.309 --> 10:36.974
but we are surrounded.

10:37.009 --> 10:40.074
I could not send you
anywhere, even if I wanted to.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.848
We have 30 kilometers
to our closest lines.

10:43.817 --> 10:44.913
You should never have
been here in the first--

10:44.948 --> 10:47.551
- Captain, my brother
was surrounded

10:47.586 --> 10:49.654
in Stalingrad for four months.

10:49.689 --> 10:50.985
A Russian shell
took both his legs,

10:51.020 --> 10:54.091
but he made it out
on the last plane.

10:54.126 --> 10:57.126
Ever since he recovered, he's
been trying to make it back.

10:58.262 --> 11:02.901
- Gudrun, you were assigned
as a radio operator, yes?

11:02.936 --> 11:06.239
- Yes, I was assigned to
General Schroder's headquarters.

11:06.275 --> 11:07.299
And I also have medical--

11:07.335 --> 11:09.542
- So you have knowledge
of all our radio codes,

11:09.577 --> 11:11.778
transmission,
deciphering of messages?

11:13.476 --> 11:14.242
- Yes.

11:15.242 --> 11:19.313
- Klaus, who's
coming to get us out?

11:20.489 --> 11:22.115
- They put together
a battle group.

11:22.150 --> 11:24.887
It says Michael
Wittmann is to lead it.

11:24.922 --> 11:26.224
- Then
we'll be just fine.

11:26.259 --> 11:27.519
- Take this.

11:27.555 --> 11:30.758
- I'm sorry, Captain, but
I could never shoot anyone.

11:30.793 --> 11:32.090
- It's not for anyone.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.329
The last bullet is for yourself.

11:34.364 --> 11:37.637
The Russians break through
our lines, you'll die anyway.

11:37.672 --> 11:40.037
This way it'll be faster
and more merciful.

11:46.478 --> 11:47.308
This is not good.

11:50.011 --> 11:52.579
Listen, you can still shoot?

11:52.614 --> 11:53.446
- Yeah.

11:55.654 --> 11:57.252
- If the Russians break through,

11:59.119 --> 12:01.058
don't let them take her alive.

12:04.333 --> 12:05.392
You know what they'll do.

12:07.202 --> 12:09.000
- Yeah, I know.

12:11.369 --> 12:12.201
- Shit.

12:12.934 --> 12:14.808
I'll get us out of here.

12:31.820 --> 12:32.859
- Can you hear me?

12:41.064 --> 12:43.064
In the name of
the German people,

12:43.099 --> 12:45.839
I award you the Wound
Badge in silver.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.240
Congratulations, my son.

12:53.414 --> 12:54.243
You're a brave man.

13:00.287 --> 13:01.250
- Doctor.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.958
What the hell is the
nurse doing here?

13:07.262 --> 13:08.088
- There's a nurse?

13:08.124 --> 13:09.395
- There's a nurse
over with Anton.

13:09.431 --> 13:10.663
Why wasn't she pulled out?

13:10.698 --> 13:11.863
- I need all the
fucking help I can get.

13:11.898 --> 13:13.260
- You should have put
her on the trains.

13:13.295 --> 13:14.934
- She volunteered.
- Do you have any idea

13:14.969 --> 13:15.630
what they'll do to her?
- You know what the Russians

13:15.666 --> 13:16.731
will do to her.

13:16.767 --> 13:17.901
- She's doing it for

13:17.936 --> 13:18.798
the Fatherland.
- They rape thousands

13:18.833 --> 13:20.034
over there.

13:20.070 --> 13:21.201
- Oh, please with
the Fatherland.

13:21.237 --> 13:22.570
- Yeah, but tell the
Fuhrer that, huh?

13:22.606 --> 13:23.437
- Damn it.

13:25.776 --> 13:26.944
- Don't you understand?

13:26.979 --> 13:28.476
I need the fucking
help here, all right?

13:28.511 --> 13:31.311
- I understand, but I'm not
letting this happen on my watch.

13:31.346 --> 13:33.918
- Like I don't have
enough to worry about.

13:33.953 --> 13:36.255
We've lost too many
good men and women.

13:36.290 --> 13:37.217
- I under--

13:37.252 --> 13:38.483
- Yeah, here's another
one right here.

13:38.519 --> 13:39.854
- Damn it, we're gonna
send you some guards.

13:39.889 --> 13:41.222
I'll find you two men

13:41.257 --> 13:42.461
to set up here.
- I got no one else left.

13:42.497 --> 13:44.394
- We'll have to find some.

13:44.429 --> 13:45.824
Come on.

13:45.860 --> 13:46.900
Good luck.

13:48.129 --> 13:49.628
- God, I hate this place.

13:56.511 --> 13:58.342
- Good morning, Steinbeck.

13:58.378 --> 13:59.710
- Captain.

13:59.745 --> 14:01.445
- We have a little problem.

14:01.481 --> 14:02.413
- Another one?

14:02.449 --> 14:03.279
- Another one.

14:04.282 --> 14:06.882
One of the nurses got
left behind by the trains.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.254
She's at the field hospital.

14:09.289 --> 14:10.017
- I see.

14:10.052 --> 14:11.419
- Go watch over them, please.

14:12.821 --> 14:13.589
- Yes, sir.

14:13.624 --> 14:14.455
- Thank you.

14:26.771 --> 14:27.738
- See that it is done.

14:27.774 --> 14:29.406
The Motherland's
counting on you.

14:29.442 --> 14:30.474
Good luck.

14:30.509 --> 14:31.340
- Good luck.

14:57.506 --> 14:58.769
- Are you ready to attack?

14:59.772 --> 15:01.406
- The Germans are surrounded.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.168
Kill them all.

15:02.203 --> 15:04.208
- Kill the fascist invaders, go.

15:15.285 --> 15:17.716
- Lieutenant, how
are you holding up?

15:20.427 --> 15:21.491
- I'm okay.

15:21.526 --> 15:22.358
- Yeah.

15:26.367 --> 15:27.198
I'm scared.

15:29.571 --> 15:31.169
- Oh, it would be all right.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.403
Klaus is gonna
get us outta here.

15:35.540 --> 15:36.506
- Right?

15:36.541 --> 15:37.640
Right.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.528
- Come with me

16:30.564 --> 16:31.892
Come with me.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.070
- Klaus.

17:16.709 --> 17:17.671
Klaus, Klaus.

17:21.649 --> 17:22.742
Russians in the woods.

17:24.213 --> 17:26.082
- Get back to the trench.

17:26.118 --> 17:28.118
Turn the anti-tank
cannon around.

17:28.153 --> 17:30.090
They're coming from
the other side.

17:37.798 --> 17:39.858
- Position two reporting.

17:42.398 --> 17:44.263
Position two report.

17:44.298 --> 17:46.168
- We are coming, copy.

18:27.879 --> 18:29.578
- Go to the right.

19:10.323 --> 19:14.326
- The Russians are
fighting us from the woods.

19:21.768 --> 19:22.800
- Fire.

22:20.914 --> 22:21.810
- Hello, yeah.

22:25.685 --> 22:28.751
- Wittmann here, I have a
stand by the field hospital,

22:29.753 --> 22:32.788
we have plenty of fuel
here, Wittmann's out.

22:34.028 --> 22:35.824
We have to get our comrades out.

22:37.963 --> 22:38.996
- Unretreat.

22:39.032 --> 22:40.565
Come on, move, move.

22:41.362 --> 22:42.402
- Yes sir.

22:43.867 --> 22:47.171
- Our friends are getting
overrun by the Russians.

22:47.206 --> 22:48.202
- Everybody moves up?

22:48.238 --> 22:49.772
- No.

22:56.915 --> 22:58.278
- Up, up

23:36.089 --> 23:37.856
- How many did we lose?

23:37.892 --> 23:38.887
- At least five.

23:39.993 --> 23:40.823
Is that Ronald?

23:41.962 --> 23:42.792
- That's Herman.

23:44.031 --> 23:44.893
- What's left of him?

23:47.534 --> 23:49.898
- How we holding up on
ammunition and water?

23:50.900 --> 23:55.700
- Ammunition, food,
bullets, water, all gone,

23:55.736 --> 23:57.004
maybe enough for tonight.

23:58.006 --> 24:00.840
- I'm sure they'll get
us out any moment now.

24:00.875 --> 24:01.879
- You know what
I've been thinking?

24:01.914 --> 24:03.180
- What?

24:03.215 --> 24:06.182
- Leave back to Hamburg.

24:06.217 --> 24:08.083
Start my own bar.

24:08.118 --> 24:08.846
- Oh.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.251
- You know, be my own beer bar.

24:10.286 --> 24:11.087
- Bar maids.

24:11.122 --> 24:11.816
- Of course.

24:11.851 --> 24:12.921
- I like the way you think.

24:14.057 --> 24:17.926
When were you planning on
this momentous change of life?

24:21.761 --> 24:23.162
- Is noon tomorrow okay?

24:24.270 --> 24:25.898
- That's a very short notice.

24:25.933 --> 24:27.365
I'm not sure the
Führer will like it.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.268
- I was hoping my commanding
officer can tell him for me.

24:31.479 --> 24:32.775
- You know, it's funny
you should mention it.

24:32.811 --> 24:35.575
I'm seeing him for tea
and coffee in a few days.

24:35.610 --> 24:36.877
I'll tell him in person,

24:36.912 --> 24:39.011
these things are best
heard from a friend.

24:39.046 --> 24:41.019
- It's good to have
friends in high places.

24:41.055 --> 24:42.054
I'm glad I met you.

24:42.089 --> 24:42.951
- That's why I'm here.

24:44.888 --> 24:48.093
So you aren't planning
on a military discount

24:48.129 --> 24:49.795
in this bar of yours, yes?

24:49.831 --> 24:50.925
- For you?

24:51.027 --> 24:53.599
You never pay anyway, I
carried you for four years now.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.134
- You break my heart,
there's no respect

24:56.170 --> 24:57.102
for a commanding officer.

24:57.137 --> 24:58.499
- But I'm here for you.

24:58.534 --> 25:00.071
- So are the Russians.

25:06.780 --> 25:10.175
- At borders please break
out, we need reinforcements

25:10.211 --> 25:13.580
we ain't ready for war
right now, where are they?

25:33.839 --> 25:37.236
- They're coming from the
trees, from the tree line.

25:43.082 --> 25:43.913
Steinberg.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.141
- We're dying here,
can't wait any longer.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.940
How far away are you?

26:15.446 --> 26:17.276
Can't wait any longer.

27:03.025 --> 27:04.724
- They're coming from
all directions now.

27:04.759 --> 27:06.561
- What are they saying?

27:51.275 --> 27:52.276
- Fire.

28:00.049 --> 28:03.382
- The drummers are
coming down the road.

28:52.169 --> 28:54.939
- We been waiting for over
an hour, where are they?

29:01.314 --> 29:02.412
- Are they coming?

29:14.292 --> 29:15.755
- Hold.

29:32.611 --> 29:34.708
- We have to go to the right.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.056
- Keep an eye on your flank.

29:56.264 --> 30:00.438
- We've got too many
wounded soldiers left.

30:00.474 --> 30:01.407
- Give me that telephone.

30:01.442 --> 30:03.540
- We need reinforcement now.

30:14.015 --> 30:16.020
- He said they met opposition.

30:27.433 --> 30:28.763
- Over, get ready.

30:47.419 --> 30:48.316
- Get ready.

31:02.231 --> 31:05.600
- They're coming from
all directions now.

31:05.636 --> 31:06.964
- Fire up high.

31:28.293 --> 31:30.028
- Keep an eye on the flanks,
they're coming from the tanks.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.198
- I have been
waiting for two days.

31:38.233 --> 31:40.431
I have concluded
we're gonna evacuee.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.370
I have dead Russians
in my trench.

31:43.236 --> 31:46.209
- No, no, waiting is over.

31:52.683 --> 31:54.316
- Here they come.

32:03.490 --> 32:06.959
- Guys, get over to
the guys over there.

32:20.982 --> 32:25.416
Find your favorite
barricade, over to the creek.

33:31.552 --> 33:32.276
- Take cover, plane.

34:47.727 --> 34:49.392
- Come on, let's go.

35:01.841 --> 35:03.340
- We stop them over there.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.825
- T-34 to the right.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.883
- German butchers.

36:03.899 --> 36:05.669
- Load.

36:08.837 --> 36:13.806
- Klaus, Klaus, hang in there
old friend they are coming.

36:29.993 --> 36:30.928
- You see them?

36:30.963 --> 36:31.927
- I see them, they're here.

36:50.546 --> 36:54.319
- Let's go, let's go
over there, help them.

37:09.967 --> 37:11.600
- They're coming.

37:12.902 --> 37:13.734
- Hey.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.002
- Hey Airborne.

37:46.037 --> 37:47.202
- Hey pretty boy Floyd.

37:47.237 --> 37:48.703
- How's your day treating you?

37:48.738 --> 37:50.769
- Trying to get these planes
ready for when we drop.

37:50.805 --> 37:53.574
- Yeah, Lang was pretty
nice though, ain't it?

37:53.609 --> 37:55.011
- Well rather be back
home in Mississippi,

37:55.046 --> 37:56.547
but this'll have to do.

37:56.582 --> 37:58.212
- Yeah, well it'll be a lot
nicer when we get to France,

37:58.248 --> 37:59.648
all those beautiful women.

37:59.684 --> 38:01.579
- Oh yeah, if I get there first,
I'll try to save you some.

38:01.614 --> 38:02.954
- Like we're gonna save your ass

38:02.989 --> 38:04.684
when we show up off the beach.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.389
- Yeah, like when I'm
gonna come up behind you

38:06.424 --> 38:08.758
and get that German
that's gonna plug you.

38:08.793 --> 38:10.822
- Hey, listen to all
seriousness, y'all
keep your head down

38:10.857 --> 38:13.359
and be safe, we'll
see you on the beach.

38:13.394 --> 38:14.561
- See you on the beach.

38:14.596 --> 38:15.894
- See you on the
beach .

38:15.996 --> 38:18.535
- See you on the beach,
private, Keep your head down.

38:21.205 --> 38:22.672
- Keep your ass down too,

38:22.707 --> 38:27.676
they'll shoot you there before
they shoot you in the head.

40:14.950 --> 40:18.749
- What wonder witness is,
the war is lost anyway.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.220
- Ulli, are you serious feel.

40:20.255 --> 40:21.152
- Seriously.

40:22.293 --> 40:24.625
- Ulli, don't be so pessimistic.

40:35.739 --> 40:37.468
- Why are you hiding
things from the Führer.

40:37.504 --> 40:38.439
- No we are not.

40:38.474 --> 40:40.136
- It is a heart attack with you.

40:40.172 --> 40:42.806
- I know what you're
hiding from the Führer.

40:42.841 --> 40:43.948
- Good to see you again Captain.

40:43.983 --> 40:44.980
- Let's be honest.

40:45.015 --> 40:45.842
- Yeah.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.110
- We're all hiding something.

40:47.146 --> 40:49.316
- How many pregnancies
have you left to France.

40:49.351 --> 40:51.385
- Will, tell him.

40:51.421 --> 40:55.689
- Not that many, come on.

40:55.725 --> 40:57.226
- On your salary,
you can afford them.

40:57.262 --> 40:58.728
- Yeah, that's the thing.

40:59.929 --> 41:03.027
I just use another name.
You know, it usually works.

41:03.063 --> 41:04.533
- Don't use my name, I
can't afford it either.

41:04.569 --> 41:05.968
- Oh, you it's over
with that earlier?

41:06.003 --> 41:06.730
Yeah.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.071
- You've holes in you.

41:08.106 --> 41:09.137
- You like to see.

41:11.944 --> 41:12.742
- Captain.

41:14.580 --> 41:18.211
- So, now it's down to
important army business.

41:18.246 --> 41:19.481
- Yes.

41:19.517 --> 41:20.714
- I know you were
here before me.

41:20.750 --> 41:25.119
So you must know the
best bar in town.

41:25.154 --> 41:26.023
- Yeah.

41:26.058 --> 41:26.954
- Don't tell him.

41:27.786 --> 41:28.959
- Does he deserve it?

41:28.995 --> 41:29.687
I don't know.

41:29.723 --> 41:30.855
- Remember the last time,

41:30.891 --> 41:32.296
we don't want that
to happen again.

41:32.332 --> 41:33.558
- Don't make me
demote you again.

41:33.593 --> 41:34.797
- Let's negotiate.

41:35.696 --> 41:37.830
The first five rounds are in you

41:37.865 --> 41:40.404
and we'll show you
where it is, okay?

41:40.439 --> 41:41.831
- After a year of
the Russian front,

41:41.867 --> 41:43.603
I haven't seen many bars.

41:43.638 --> 41:45.008
It's a deal, on me.

41:45.043 --> 41:45.973
- Done deal.

41:47.309 --> 41:48.305
- All right.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.990
- I'm sure it is.

42:06.793 --> 42:08.229
- Excuse me, the field hospital.

42:08.265 --> 42:09.065
- It's that way.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.296
- This way?

42:10.331 --> 42:11.133
- Yes.

42:11.168 --> 42:12.036
- Thank you.

42:27.949 --> 42:31.018
- Yep, we're gonna
bring him down this way.

42:34.225 --> 42:35.658
- Yeah, okay.

42:35.694 --> 42:37.954
- And I'm sure you've
noticed the readiness

42:37.989 --> 42:40.298
of our forces here in Normandy.

42:40.334 --> 42:43.234
- They do seem
rather unprepared.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.536
- My God, half the men here

42:45.571 --> 42:50.774
are either Russian,
Ukrainian, or Polish.

42:51.742 --> 42:52.972
They'll scatter like
flies in the wind

42:53.008 --> 42:55.006
at the very first sign
of approaching danger.

42:55.041 --> 42:57.945
I want you to inspect
our defense here

42:57.981 --> 43:01.081
and give me a report on
how they can be improved.

43:02.249 --> 43:04.722
- I will be honored to
help in any way that I can.

43:06.025 --> 43:06.617
- Gentlemen.

43:06.652 --> 43:07.692
- Hi Hitler.

43:09.326 --> 43:10.156
- Field Marshall.

43:11.528 --> 43:13.126
I have seen information for you.

43:14.665 --> 43:16.996
- You always have
something for me,

43:17.032 --> 43:20.934
but it never seems to
be anything I can use.

43:20.970 --> 43:23.868
- Captain, General
Frank's here will show you

43:23.903 --> 43:25.402
the layout of the countryside.

43:27.180 --> 43:29.076
- What's up gentlemen.

44:11.992 --> 44:12.583
- Morning.

44:12.619 --> 44:13.417
- Morning.

44:14.525 --> 44:16.789
So what do you think Klaus?

44:16.824 --> 44:18.125
- I think it looks like hell.

44:18.993 --> 44:20.124
We don't have
enough of anything.

44:20.159 --> 44:21.197
How are we gonna
hold the allies back?

44:21.233 --> 44:22.597
We have nothing.

44:22.632 --> 44:24.131
- We have mindless optimism.

44:24.967 --> 44:27.331
- Found a way to shoot
that out of a gun.

44:27.367 --> 44:30.302
- Any day now, our
scientists are working on it.

45:12.647 --> 45:13.752
- Hey, wake up.

45:14.715 --> 45:16.183
Mines my friend.

45:17.219 --> 45:19.554
It better be important,
I just finished my watch.

45:19.589 --> 45:20.390
- But it's important.

45:20.425 --> 45:21.620
- What is the problem?

45:21.655 --> 45:22.824
- It's Ulli.

45:22.859 --> 45:25.394
- Ulli, what the
hell did he do now?

45:25.429 --> 45:26.393
- He's gone again.

45:26.428 --> 45:27.229
- Gone?

45:27.264 --> 45:28.363
- Yeah.

45:28.399 --> 45:29.198
- For how long?

45:29.234 --> 45:30.060
- No idea.

45:30.095 --> 45:32.165
- And what do we do about it?

45:32.201 --> 45:34.305
- You go to town, ask
some just good questions.

45:34.340 --> 45:35.673
And I'll go tell Klaus.

45:35.708 --> 45:37.470
- It better not be
the resistance again.

45:37.505 --> 45:38.308
- Yeah.

45:38.344 --> 45:39.305
Or the MPs got him.

45:40.345 --> 45:41.241
- I'll go to town.

45:52.092 --> 45:53.354
- Morning.

45:53.390 --> 45:54.221
- Morning.

45:58.357 --> 46:01.563
- Year and a half on
the Eastern Front.

46:01.598 --> 46:03.063
I've never seen an egg.

46:03.099 --> 46:05.462
If I wanted the eggs I'd
have to lay it myself.

46:05.498 --> 46:08.097
Or steal it from some
pissed off Russian farmer.

46:08.133 --> 46:10.237
Life in France, it's good.

46:11.410 --> 46:12.408
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:12.443 --> 46:13.708
We appreciate it.

46:13.743 --> 46:15.506
It's an enjoyable time here.

46:17.981 --> 46:20.318
- If I could, I would
send this breakfast

46:20.353 --> 46:22.417
to everybody in Russia.

46:22.453 --> 46:23.354
They deserve it.

46:23.390 --> 46:24.856
- Always a good way Klaus.

46:25.755 --> 46:28.026
- Well, when I had my share.

46:28.061 --> 46:28.655
- Yeah.

46:28.690 --> 46:29.491
- What's going on?

46:29.527 --> 46:31.225
- We have a problem.

46:32.762 --> 46:34.263
- Are the Americans here?

46:34.298 --> 46:35.262
- Nope.

46:36.369 --> 46:37.398
- Are the Russians here?

46:37.433 --> 46:38.265
- Nope.

46:39.097 --> 46:40.300
- involved.

46:41.306 --> 46:42.269
- Not yet.

46:44.342 --> 46:45.473
- That bad?

46:45.509 --> 46:46.339
- It might be.

46:47.876 --> 46:49.642
- All right, what's going on?

46:49.677 --> 46:50.508
- It's Ulli.

46:51.550 --> 46:53.148
- What the hell did he do now?

46:53.183 --> 46:56.250
Did he get drunk again and
piss on the General's car?

46:56.884 --> 46:58.586
- That was a good one.

46:58.622 --> 46:59.723
That would be nice.

46:59.758 --> 47:02.157
No, he's been
missing two days now.

47:04.056 --> 47:05.193
- Anybody reported?

47:06.496 --> 47:07.294
- Not yet.

47:10.835 --> 47:13.632
It's a matter of
tough time though.

47:13.667 --> 47:14.499
- Shit.

47:16.168 --> 47:18.142
He just can't help it, can he?

47:18.177 --> 47:19.009
- No.

47:20.975 --> 47:23.310
- I'd just go look for him.

48:36.522 --> 48:37.547
- Are there maneuvers?

48:37.582 --> 48:39.621
- No, the resistance
has been very active

48:39.657 --> 48:41.392
the last few weeks.

48:52.968 --> 48:54.933
- Just the past few weeks?

49:02.009 --> 49:03.377
- Let's get out of here.

49:33.338 --> 49:34.542
- Is Captain Miller here?

49:34.577 --> 49:35.445
- Yes.

49:35.481 --> 49:36.608
Just over there.

49:38.051 --> 49:40.447
- Captain Miller, I have
a order for Gerald Frank.

49:41.750 --> 49:42.581
I'm sorry.

51:00.327 --> 51:03.101
- So you got the
orders to do it.

51:07.032 --> 51:07.864
- Yeah.

51:09.075 --> 51:12.770
The general thought it
was best if I did it.

51:19.352 --> 51:20.151
- Yeah.

51:21.686 --> 51:22.917
Well that's good.

51:22.953 --> 51:24.452
It's better with a friend.

51:30.927 --> 51:32.658
- I have to ask, why?

51:42.472 --> 51:45.374
- I just had enough of
this whole thing, you know?

51:48.340 --> 51:49.840
And I met this girl.

51:51.517 --> 51:52.315
- A girl.

51:53.586 --> 51:54.581
- Classic story.

51:58.622 --> 51:59.784
Yeah.

51:59.819 --> 52:01.619
I mean, why else do men do
the stupid things men do?

52:01.654 --> 52:04.894
I mean, sometimes I
think the war started

52:04.929 --> 52:06.527
because of a girl involved.

52:08.031 --> 52:08.993
- It wouldn't be the first time.

52:09.028 --> 52:09.827
- No.

52:11.637 --> 52:12.467
Hellen of Troy.

52:14.133 --> 52:15.173
- For a one.

52:22.708 --> 52:26.313
So you think this
whole thing started

52:26.349 --> 52:31.552
just because Hitler,
Churchill, Stalin.

52:32.454 --> 52:35.355
They all just show
after their girlfriends.

52:35.391 --> 52:37.423
- Well, it did make
sense, doesn't it?

52:37.458 --> 52:40.627
I mean, stupid men
do stupid things.

52:42.096 --> 52:42.959
And that's it.

52:44.595 --> 52:47.601
- This is getting pretty stupid.

52:49.536 --> 52:50.767
- Yeah, I know
some of those guys,

52:50.803 --> 52:52.709
I mean, they could just
have sent them flowers

52:52.745 --> 52:54.677
and let that be it.

52:54.713 --> 52:55.813
Make it easy.

52:55.848 --> 52:56.876
- Flowers would've been good.

52:56.911 --> 52:58.115
- Yeah.

52:58.150 --> 53:00.545
I mean, that's how it
started, wasn't it?

53:00.580 --> 53:02.750
I mean, do you
remember Sudetenland?

53:02.785 --> 53:03.650
- Yeah.

53:05.151 --> 53:06.991
Austria too.

53:07.026 --> 53:09.493
Everybody threw
flowers at us then.

53:09.528 --> 53:10.360
- Yeah.

53:12.696 --> 53:13.556
Yeah.

53:13.591 --> 53:15.365
Well that suddenly changed.

53:20.671 --> 53:21.437
- Yeah.

53:36.250 --> 53:37.950
Sit down, sit down.

53:37.986 --> 53:38.820
- Captain.

53:38.856 --> 53:39.953
- Good morning.

53:39.989 --> 53:40.791
- Good morning.

53:40.826 --> 53:41.823
- Good morning Captain.

53:41.859 --> 53:42.452
- Good morning.

53:42.487 --> 53:43.824
- We got some coffee.

53:43.859 --> 53:44.587
- Yep.

53:44.622 --> 53:46.561
- Yuri, coffee for the captain.

53:48.361 --> 53:49.766
- Where was Yuri from?

53:49.801 --> 53:51.302
- Poland, I think.

53:52.199 --> 53:52.999
- I don't know.

53:53.035 --> 53:54.497
- I'm not sure.

53:54.533 --> 53:56.071
- Big one world of German.

53:56.106 --> 53:58.304
Well, it could be from Ukraine.

54:04.410 --> 54:06.548
- Thank you, thank you.

54:09.018 --> 54:09.980
- Eastern Poland.

54:12.124 --> 54:14.754
And how do you all
can communicate?

54:16.862 --> 54:19.262
- You make it work.

54:19.298 --> 54:22.598
- And how do you make
it work during battle?

54:22.633 --> 54:26.166
- Well, we try not to let him
too close with the weapons.

54:26.201 --> 54:27.802
He's a Ruski after all.

54:27.837 --> 54:28.839
- Ruski.

54:28.874 --> 54:29.632
- Yeah, you're Ruski.

54:29.667 --> 54:31.169
- Why you all call me Ruski huh?

54:31.205 --> 54:32.338
- You're Ruski.

54:32.373 --> 54:34.711
- I hate Ruski, they're pigs.

54:34.747 --> 54:35.877
I'm a Prussian.

54:35.913 --> 54:36.779
- Yes, you are.

54:36.814 --> 54:37.744
Goddamn it.

54:40.181 --> 54:41.011
What's so funny?

54:42.284 --> 54:43.816
- I have something to tell you.

54:47.659 --> 54:48.491
Ulli.

54:49.223 --> 54:50.658
- What is that?

54:51.358 --> 54:52.830
Oh, they found him?

54:52.865 --> 54:54.464
- Yes, they found him.

55:03.369 --> 55:04.408
- When Captain?

55:07.242 --> 55:08.412
- Tomorrow morning.

55:11.179 --> 55:12.081
- Yeah, right.

55:15.217 --> 55:16.281
- You're a good man.

55:16.317 --> 55:17.784
For a good solution.

55:20.859 --> 55:21.788
Drink, drink.

55:26.561 --> 55:28.663
- Spending all
the time together.

55:30.763 --> 55:32.799
- It's to good
men in the ground.

55:33.837 --> 55:35.398
- Yeah.

55:35.433 --> 55:36.638
Another one.

55:37.975 --> 55:39.039
- Another one.

55:39.075 --> 55:40.444
- Another one.

55:44.676 --> 55:46.516
- Go see him in the prison.

55:48.052 --> 55:49.852
He's over there now.

55:49.888 --> 55:50.718
Bring some wine.

56:19.879 --> 56:21.513
- So have you seen
any vulgares around?

56:21.548 --> 56:23.850
- Still thinking about women.

56:24.984 --> 56:27.518
- You still think they'd
nag you like women do.

56:27.553 --> 56:29.526
- Yeah, especially you.

56:46.208 --> 56:47.707
Want a cigarette?

56:47.742 --> 56:49.942
- No thanks, those
things will kill you.

56:52.815 --> 56:54.881
- You know, you're starting
to sound like my mother.

56:55.780 --> 56:58.181
- Well, so should be.

57:00.693 --> 57:01.492
- Yep.

57:15.304 --> 57:16.573
- I'm scared as shit.

57:18.871 --> 57:20.709
But this is the
way it has to be.

57:48.038 --> 57:49.034
- It's okay.

57:52.041 --> 57:52.873
- Okay.

58:30.277 --> 58:31.109
Ready?

58:39.121 --> 58:39.953
Aim.

58:50.033 --> 58:50.627
Fire.

59:38.209 --> 59:40.978
- This whole thing is
not going very well.

59:41.014 --> 59:43.419
We have to convince
the higher command

59:43.455 --> 59:45.321
to use the all
resources to repel

59:45.356 --> 59:47.589
an invasion on the beaches.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:02.365
- Nobody wants to admit
they might be wrong

1:00:03.542 --> 1:00:05.269
and lose their face
in front of the fear.

1:00:07.039 --> 1:00:10.076
- It's the same
shit it always was.

1:00:11.076 --> 1:00:13.550
They are wars run
by desk generals

1:00:13.585 --> 1:00:18.516
who never shed any
blood and any dirt ever.

1:00:18.552 --> 1:00:20.123
- That's right.

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:21.125
- Of course it is.

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:22.625
- That's why you and I,

1:00:22.660 --> 1:00:25.894
we have to make the
most compelling report

1:00:25.930 --> 1:00:29.359
that the Field Marshall can
present to Hitler himself.

1:00:31.202 --> 1:00:32.065
- I understand.

1:00:32.964 --> 1:00:34.265
I'm gonna do my very best.

1:01:22.186 --> 1:01:24.115
- Get ready.

1:01:24.150 --> 1:01:26.715
- Gotta put your gas
as soon as possible.

1:01:26.751 --> 1:01:27.653
- Stand up

1:01:27.689 --> 1:01:28.990
- Straight line let's go.

1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:38.467
Sound of equipment check.

1:01:38.503 --> 1:01:39.700
Everything okay.

1:01:39.736 --> 1:01:40.700
Everything okay.

1:01:40.736 --> 1:01:41.701
Everything okay.

1:01:41.737 --> 1:01:42.701
Everything okay.

1:01:52.448 --> 1:01:54.081
- Go, go, go, go.

1:02:02.623 --> 1:02:04.091
Go, go, go, go.

1:02:12.103 --> 1:02:12.935
Go, go.

1:02:43.930 --> 1:02:45.297
- Remember our motto gentlemen.

1:02:45.332 --> 1:02:49.403
No mission too typical for
a sacrifice to the grave.

1:02:49.438 --> 1:02:50.265
Duty first.

1:02:50.301 --> 1:02:52.139
We're the first
infantry division.

1:02:53.139 --> 1:02:54.873
We've done Africa,
we've done Sicily,

1:02:54.908 --> 1:02:57.077
and now we're doing France.

1:02:57.113 --> 1:02:59.976
They know we're coming,
they know we're the best.

1:03:00.011 --> 1:03:01.680
- How you guys feeling?

1:03:01.715 --> 1:03:02.749
- Good Lieutenant.

1:03:02.784 --> 1:03:05.020
- I'm nauseous sir.

1:03:05.055 --> 1:03:07.455
- I don't
blame you, I'm nauseous too.

1:03:07.491 --> 1:03:09.358
- Are you all right?

1:03:09.393 --> 1:03:11.123
Are you all right?

1:03:11.158 --> 1:03:15.064
All the new guys,
stick with your mate.

1:03:15.099 --> 1:03:17.831
All the obstacles are gonna
be pre-sighted on the beach.

1:03:17.867 --> 1:03:21.032
Do not bunch up
near an obstacle.

1:03:21.068 --> 1:03:22.571
Spread out and
get up to the hill

1:03:22.606 --> 1:03:25.139
as fast as you possibly can.

1:03:56.407 --> 1:03:57.567
- Sound it up.

1:04:04.075 --> 1:04:06.114
- Alarm, quick, quick,

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:13.319
- Hello

1:04:14.953 --> 1:04:16.592
- This is it.

1:04:16.627 --> 1:04:19.325
- Alarm, alarm.

1:04:23.668 --> 1:04:24.963
- I need to know
what's going on.

1:04:24.998 --> 1:04:26.503
The men are confused out there.

1:04:26.538 --> 1:04:28.098
First you call

1:04:28.133 --> 1:04:29.538
- Horizon is full of ships.

1:04:31.540 --> 1:04:32.338
- Come out.

1:04:34.238 --> 1:04:35.839
Come out, Americans coming.

1:04:40.450 --> 1:04:41.347
- Oh my God.

1:05:12.113 --> 1:05:14.812
- Tell the cannons
to fire at will.

1:05:14.847 --> 1:05:15.648
- Yes, sir.

1:05:15.684 --> 1:05:16.484
- Well in range.

1:05:16.519 --> 1:05:17.518
- Yes, sir.

1:05:25.431 --> 1:05:26.321
- Is there any hope?

1:05:26.356 --> 1:05:28.930
The Luftwaffe will show today?

1:05:28.965 --> 1:05:31.401
- I will spend a
lot of

1:05:31.436 --> 1:05:32.398
We'll do our best.

1:05:44.346 --> 1:05:48.986
- Where the hell did they
get all those ships from.

1:06:05.834 --> 1:06:07.537
- That was position one.

1:06:09.500 --> 1:06:11.437
- Position one is
lost, report it.

1:06:17.715 --> 1:06:19.780
- One minute to the beach.

1:06:19.815 --> 1:06:21.744
One minute to the beach.

1:06:27.986 --> 1:06:28.985
- Get ready.

1:06:29.020 --> 1:06:30.287
- Stand by.

1:06:30.323 --> 1:06:32.825
- Go, get the hell
outta my boat.

1:06:32.860 --> 1:06:34.460
- Go, go, go, go.

1:06:35.599 --> 1:06:36.532
Get off the boat.

1:06:36.567 --> 1:06:38.733
Get off the boat.

1:06:47.875 --> 1:06:49.342
Jesus Christ.

1:06:49.378 --> 1:06:51.807
Jesus Christ, I just lost
every guy on my boat.

1:07:11.997 --> 1:07:13.103
- Go go go.

1:07:23.779 --> 1:07:25.412
- Go, go, go, go.

1:07:35.859 --> 1:07:36.923
- We're getting killed out.

1:07:36.959 --> 1:07:38.089
Move up towards the banks.

1:07:38.125 --> 1:07:39.626
Soldier, move your men up.

1:07:39.662 --> 1:07:40.526
Let's go.

1:08:21.506 --> 1:08:22.337
- Oh God.

1:08:33.751 --> 1:08:38.350
- Make room, we're here.

1:08:38.385 --> 1:08:40.017
- Come on second
squad, move in now.

1:08:40.052 --> 1:08:41.257
Move in now.

1:08:46.896 --> 1:08:48.490
- Sir, I'm the last one.

1:08:48.525 --> 1:08:51.366
- Where the rest of the guys?

1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:03.642
- Hold your head.

1:09:08.115 --> 1:09:09.311
- Get off the boat.

1:09:09.346 --> 1:09:11.117
Get off the boat.

1:09:11.152 --> 1:09:12.918
- Right here, and here, boom.

1:09:12.954 --> 1:09:14.251
- Then find him.

1:09:14.286 --> 1:09:15.621
This is not an exercise.

1:09:19.725 --> 1:09:22.461
- I suggest that we move
two infantry regiments

1:09:22.496 --> 1:09:24.497
and one artillery
regiment into the area

1:09:24.532 --> 1:09:26.429
to provide proper support
should the invasion

1:09:26.464 --> 1:09:28.271
occur in that particular sector.

1:09:50.259 --> 1:09:50.920
- Okay, we gotta
get off this beach.

1:09:53.697 --> 1:09:54.624
Fuck you.

1:09:54.660 --> 1:09:56.695
- That time the ally
would be in Paris.

1:09:58.364 --> 1:10:00.564
- Jesus, block them on purpose.

1:10:00.599 --> 1:10:03.134
Jesus, I lost every
guy on my boat.

1:10:03.169 --> 1:10:03.969
- You got a smoke?

1:10:04.005 --> 1:10:04.835
- Oh yeah, sir.

1:10:05.743 --> 1:10:06.872
- You got a light?

1:10:06.907 --> 1:10:08.176
Fuck.

1:10:08.211 --> 1:10:09.910
- We gotta get off
the fucking beach.

1:10:09.945 --> 1:10:11.147
- I'm fucking wet.

1:10:11.182 --> 1:10:12.010
- I'm damn wetter
than you fucking are.

1:10:12.045 --> 1:10:12.843
- Fuck you.

1:10:15.181 --> 1:10:16.483
- Jesus Christ.

1:10:16.519 --> 1:10:18.550
- The ally of France that
made attack in Normandy.

1:10:18.586 --> 1:10:21.090
I have no time to wait,
do you not understand?

1:10:21.125 --> 1:10:23.293
I see a thousand
ships on the ocean.

1:10:24.191 --> 1:10:26.525
No, I'm dead serious.

1:10:26.561 --> 1:10:29.733
Why do you not come here
and see for yourself?

1:10:36.873 --> 1:10:38.506
- I need a medic.

1:10:39.577 --> 1:10:40.170
Medic

1:10:41.909 --> 1:10:42.708
- Move

1:11:03.031 --> 1:11:04.664
- Go, go, go, go.

1:11:19.918 --> 1:11:21.780
- Lower your fucking head.

1:11:22.887 --> 1:11:25.315
What is everyone else?

1:11:25.351 --> 1:11:27.757
- I'm the last one.

1:11:38.033 --> 1:11:39.094
Anton, Anton.

1:11:44.503 --> 1:11:47.140
- You, I want that 42 taken out.

1:11:47.175 --> 1:11:50.043
- MG 42 on the right.

1:12:04.996 --> 1:12:06.893
- We gotta get off this beach.

1:12:06.928 --> 1:12:07.656
- Yeah.

1:12:07.691 --> 1:12:08.862
- We gotta get off the beach.

1:12:08.897 --> 1:12:09.795
- Go.

1:12:13.270 --> 1:12:18.474
- Patrol, let's
move, let's move.

1:12:19.844 --> 1:12:21.536
- Everyone fire.

1:12:24.013 --> 1:12:25.514
- Get up here now.

1:12:27.344 --> 1:12:28.916
Move.

1:12:28.951 --> 1:12:29.782
- Let's go.

1:12:45.098 --> 1:12:45.930
- Move.

1:12:49.874 --> 1:12:53.074
- Coming fire.

1:13:10.127 --> 1:13:11.155
- I can't wait till morning

1:13:11.191 --> 1:13:12.724
- Oh shit.

1:13:12.759 --> 1:13:14.930
- I'll get the blood
pumping, all right.

1:13:15.693 --> 1:13:16.931
Where are your boys from?

1:13:16.967 --> 1:13:17.965
- Oh, Tennessee.

1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:18.834
- Tennessee?

1:13:18.869 --> 1:13:19.934
- Wisconsin.

1:13:19.969 --> 1:13:20.936
- Wisconsin.

1:13:20.971 --> 1:13:21.564
- What about you?

1:13:21.599 --> 1:13:22.604
- No way cheese head.

1:13:29.639 --> 1:13:30.441
- What do we now?

1:13:30.476 --> 1:13:31.274
- We get off this beach.

1:13:31.309 --> 1:13:32.812
- Why?

1:13:32.847 --> 1:13:34.378
Because if the blood foot
happens, where do we move?

1:13:35.414 --> 1:13:36.583
- We're gonna die.

1:13:36.618 --> 1:13:38.252
- The only people
that you're gonna see

1:13:38.287 --> 1:13:39.220
if you don't get off this beach,

1:13:39.255 --> 1:13:40.617
is great registration and God.

1:13:40.652 --> 1:13:42.651
Now, get up over that hill.

1:13:46.262 --> 1:13:48.564
Move out, go, go, go, go.

1:14:49.687 --> 1:14:50.886
- All clear, let's go.

1:14:50.922 --> 1:14:54.062
Five, six quarters
get out of here.

1:14:54.098 --> 1:14:54.960
- This is not good.

1:14:56.034 --> 1:14:57.132
- They're too strong.

1:15:00.138 --> 1:15:01.563
- We have a close defense.

1:15:01.598 --> 1:15:02.704
- Yes, sir.

1:15:39.972 --> 1:15:41.809
- Sir, we have contact
with the beaches.

1:15:42.776 --> 1:15:43.940
- This
is not, this is--

1:15:53.287 --> 1:15:54.223
- General.

1:15:54.258 --> 1:15:56.156
- What's the situation soldier?

1:15:56.192 --> 1:15:57.355
- It's hopeless.

1:15:57.391 --> 1:15:58.758
- I understand.

1:15:58.794 --> 1:16:01.257
- This will be the final
report from Normandy.

1:16:03.033 --> 1:16:04.330
Yes, sir.

1:16:04.365 --> 1:16:05.327
God bless Germany.

1:16:06.630 --> 1:16:07.670
All right.

1:17:01.818 --> 1:17:03.253
- I'll fight too.

1:17:05.228 --> 1:17:06.921
- Let's go fight.

1:17:06.957 --> 1:17:09.325
- Let's go fight, come on.

1:17:40.693 --> 1:17:41.525
- Good luck my friend.

1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:46.333
- Good luck

1:18:37.915 --> 1:18:39.888
- Let's go, let's go.

1:18:48.498 --> 1:18:49.931
- Let's get to the artillery.

1:19:02.774 --> 1:19:04.209
- Hey move, move.

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:38.842
- Where the hell
have y'all been?

1:19:38.877 --> 1:19:39.877
- Where have we been?

1:19:39.912 --> 1:19:41.548
- Yes, where have you been?

1:19:41.584 --> 1:19:42.517
I've been here all night.

1:19:42.552 --> 1:19:44.450
- I lost every guy on the boat.

1:19:44.486 --> 1:19:45.316
- Well welcome--

1:19:46.390 --> 1:19:47.189
- Everybody on the...

1:19:47.225 --> 1:19:47.951
Hey, hey, hey.

1:19:47.986 --> 1:19:50.291
- Krause, where do you need us?

1:19:50.326 --> 1:19:51.353
- This way?

1:19:51.389 --> 1:19:52.821
You feeling froggy sir
or you want me on point?

1:19:52.857 --> 1:19:53.758
- After you Tom.

1:19:53.793 --> 1:19:55.428
- Appreciate it, sir.

1:19:55.463 --> 1:19:56.261
- Airborne.

1:20:01.303 --> 1:20:02.435
- Hey.

1:20:02.471 --> 1:20:03.271
- Hey, Colorado.

1:20:03.306 --> 1:20:04.267
- Tennessee.

1:20:04.302 --> 1:20:05.408
- How're you doing
bud, good to see you.

1:20:05.443 --> 1:20:06.167
- You made it off the beach.

1:20:06.202 --> 1:20:07.408
- Yeah, see you did too man.

1:20:07.444 --> 1:20:08.336
- What's your name?

1:20:08.371 --> 1:20:09.511
- It's Garonne,
everybody calls me Gar.

1:20:09.546 --> 1:20:10.779
- Gar, nice to meet you, Lee.

1:20:10.815 --> 1:20:12.447
- Lee, you wanna help
me with these prisoners?

1:20:17.419 --> 1:20:18.418
- Sergeant?

1:20:18.454 --> 1:20:19.647
- Yes, Major.

1:20:19.683 --> 1:20:21.454
- Understand none of your
officers made it off the beach.

1:20:21.489 --> 1:20:22.350
- Yes, sir.

1:20:22.385 --> 1:20:23.618
To my understanding,
that is correct.

1:20:26.126 --> 1:20:28.457
- I'm gonna make you
a second Lieutenant.

1:20:28.493 --> 1:20:30.663
Get your unit together,
get down that course way.

1:20:30.699 --> 1:20:31.799
Link up with the airborne,

1:20:31.834 --> 1:20:33.934
they're pretty
strapped in down there.

1:20:33.969 --> 1:20:35.336
- Yes, sir Major, I'll
take care of it sir.

1:20:35.371 --> 1:20:36.435
- Carry on.

1:20:36.471 --> 1:20:37.335
- Yes sir.

1:20:44.548 --> 1:20:47.246
- So, is that a good thing?

1:20:49.783 --> 1:20:51.751
Come on, get your gear.

1:20:51.786 --> 1:20:53.047
Let's go help out the airborne.

1:20:53.083 --> 1:20:54.286
- Roger, Lieutenant.

1:20:57.153 --> 1:20:59.021
- Second up, second up.

1:21:25.721 --> 1:21:27.719
- We made it off the beach,

1:21:27.755 --> 1:21:29.420
- We're getting out.

1:21:43.908 --> 1:21:46.371
- Burn the papers and
kill all the prisoners.

1:22:18.708 --> 1:22:20.201
- There's more Germans coming.

1:22:20.236 --> 1:22:21.373
When I say go, we go.

1:22:22.810 --> 1:22:24.475
Three, two, one, go.

1:22:35.622 --> 1:22:36.421
- Alarm.

1:23:14.631 --> 1:23:15.429
- Come on, let's move.

1:23:15.465 --> 1:23:16.296
Let's go.

1:23:30.141 --> 1:23:32.114
- First one, come on.

1:24:03.474 --> 1:24:05.646
Put your weapons
down, come on get up.

1:24:05.682 --> 1:24:07.479
- Get up right now.

1:24:13.616 --> 1:24:16.818
- They're just a
bunch of kids Serg.

1:24:22.259 --> 1:24:23.695
- Get up right now.

1:24:23.730 --> 1:24:24.562
Get up.

1:24:27.769 --> 1:24:28.669
- Don't shoot.

1:24:28.705 --> 1:24:30.469
Please don't shoot.

1:24:46.454 --> 1:24:49.521
- I haven't taken a decent
shit since the D-Day.

1:24:57.964 --> 1:25:00.866
Oh, God.

1:27:29.985 --> 1:27:30.950
- You can't shoot us.

1:27:30.986 --> 1:27:31.986
You can't shoot us.

1:27:32.021 --> 1:27:33.853
It's against the convention.

1:27:39.024 --> 1:27:40.258
- Hey.

1:27:40.293 --> 1:27:42.727
No, what the hell are you doing?

1:27:43.796 --> 1:27:47.835
This is not, how we do
things in the German army.

1:27:47.871 --> 1:27:48.733
- How do we behave?

1:27:49.667 --> 1:27:51.736
- Who the hell do
you think you are?

1:27:52.569 --> 1:27:54.007
We can not behave like this.

1:27:54.043 --> 1:27:55.507
If we behave like animals,

1:27:55.543 --> 1:27:57.640
history would have
justified contempt for us.

1:27:57.675 --> 1:28:00.074
This is not how German
officers behave.

1:28:20.596 --> 1:28:22.168
- What's going on here?

1:28:22.203 --> 1:28:24.173
- This man has interrupted us.

1:28:24.208 --> 1:28:26.172
- They're shooting
on prisoners general.

1:28:26.207 --> 1:28:27.772
This is not how we do things.

1:28:29.774 --> 1:28:31.177
- Do you know how
many German soldiers

1:28:31.212 --> 1:28:32.810
will lose their lives over this?

1:28:34.746 --> 1:28:36.781
The German army does
not shoot prisoners.

1:28:37.988 --> 1:28:39.784
You better leave this out to us.

1:28:52.398 --> 1:28:54.769
Captain, you have a situation.

1:28:54.805 --> 1:28:55.668
Take care of it.

1:29:07.111 --> 1:29:11.214
- When you remember Germans,
we are not all like this.

1:29:11.249 --> 1:29:13.318
- Thank you.

1:29:13.353 --> 1:29:14.986
- I remember you, thank you.

1:29:15.022 --> 1:29:16.152
Thank you.

1:29:16.188 --> 1:29:16.986
Thank you.

1:29:29.336 --> 1:29:31.806
- Well, we made it Lieutenant.

1:29:31.842 --> 1:29:32.672
- Yes we did.

1:29:35.210 --> 1:29:36.841
- Guess that's all we can do.

1:29:38.075 --> 1:29:41.579
Make it through today,
make it through tomorrow.

1:29:41.614 --> 1:29:43.683
Make it through
the day after that.

1:29:43.719 --> 1:29:46.620
And just keep making it till
the end of this damn war.

1:29:48.423 --> 1:29:51.119
- Well, I've made
it perfectly clear

1:29:51.154 --> 1:29:55.860
I have no intention of dying
in this place, you know?

1:29:56.696 --> 1:29:59.732
20 years from now,
when this is all over,

1:30:00.801 --> 1:30:03.703
back in Tennessee, I'll be
sitting around a campfire,

1:30:03.738 --> 1:30:08.136
just like this telling
stories to my grandchildren.

1:30:10.776 --> 1:30:12.844
- What are you gonna
tell 'em about today?

1:30:22.685 --> 1:30:24.119
- Not a goddamn thing.

1:30:41.776 --> 1:30:44.044
- Sergeant, sergeant,
the Americans are coming.

1:30:44.079 --> 1:30:45.011
- All right, men.

1:30:45.047 --> 1:30:46.482
Take positions.

1:31:10.701 --> 1:31:12.974
- Hey, the Americans in here.

1:31:23.485 --> 1:31:24.746
- Yeah, I'll be
damned if I'm gonna

1:31:24.781 --> 1:31:27.186
get killed here at this bridge.

1:31:29.323 --> 1:31:30.625
- We made it this far.

1:31:38.034 --> 1:31:39.031
- You got a smoke?

1:31:39.066 --> 1:31:39.898
- Yeah.

1:31:41.335 --> 1:31:42.604
- So what's going on?

1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:45.370
- Just bear that at least.

1:31:45.406 --> 1:31:46.905
- Didn't mean for you Tom.

1:31:47.936 --> 1:31:49.405
- All right, So what's the deal?

1:31:49.441 --> 1:31:51.379
- Well, I got--

1:31:51.415 --> 1:31:53.014
- Will you get that
fucking thing out?

1:31:53.049 --> 1:31:54.410
- I'm trying, Sir.

1:31:54.446 --> 1:31:55.914
- Jesus Christ.

1:31:57.450 --> 1:31:58.782
- Sir, I need some help.

1:31:58.818 --> 1:32:00.280
I got guys pinned
down at this bridge,

1:32:00.316 --> 1:32:02.787
but we've been trying to
all morning and all night.

1:32:02.822 --> 1:32:04.956
I need as much help
as you can give me.

1:32:05.624 --> 1:32:07.358
- Where's your fucking bridge?

1:32:07.393 --> 1:32:08.291
- It's right here.

1:32:08.327 --> 1:32:09.496
All right.

1:32:09.531 --> 1:32:10.929
You come up this
road about two clicks

1:32:10.965 --> 1:32:12.359
and then take a left, you'll
run right into the bridge.

1:32:12.395 --> 1:32:14.303
We got German forces right
here that are plummeting us

1:32:14.338 --> 1:32:15.802
with machine gun
and small arms fire.

1:32:15.838 --> 1:32:18.638
I need every guy that can
breathe and pull a trigger.

1:32:18.673 --> 1:32:20.141
- We're gonna have to
go around the flank.

1:32:20.176 --> 1:32:21.575
It's gonna take time.

1:32:21.610 --> 1:32:23.276
- Doesn't do us any
good taking that bridge

1:32:23.311 --> 1:32:24.478
without taking the town.

1:32:24.513 --> 1:32:25.411
- You come past
this village about--

1:32:25.446 --> 1:32:26.745
- Are you fucking happy now?

1:32:26.780 --> 1:32:29.114
- Yes Private, damn,
do you want a cookie?

1:32:29.149 --> 1:32:30.546
- Jesus.

1:32:33.751 --> 1:32:35.157
- We gotta help him take it.

1:32:35.192 --> 1:32:36.320
So come on, let's move out.

1:32:36.355 --> 1:32:37.252
Keep going.

1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:41.425
- You, hold this bridge,
hold this at all costs.

1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:42.593
Do you understand?

1:32:42.628 --> 1:32:44.560
I'm going for reinforcements.

1:32:59.911 --> 1:33:01.083
- We got 'em pushed
off the bridge.

1:33:01.118 --> 1:33:02.046
We gotta make it over.

1:33:05.719 --> 1:33:07.650
- Supported by tanks
and half tracks.

1:33:07.686 --> 1:33:08.815
- All right guys, move on.

1:33:08.851 --> 1:33:10.224
Let's go, let's go.

1:33:10.259 --> 1:33:11.585
Push up on the right.

1:33:11.621 --> 1:33:12.826
- Lively.

1:33:34.512 --> 1:33:35.343
- Out, out

1:33:39.518 --> 1:33:41.085
- A single there.

1:33:54.163 --> 1:33:55.365
- But we have some
more tanks coming.

1:33:55.400 --> 1:33:56.570
- Good.

1:33:56.605 --> 1:33:57.904
- What do you
think we should do?

1:33:58.973 --> 1:34:00.773
- Well, I don't want to go
back to the Eastern Front.

1:34:00.808 --> 1:34:03.043
So I suggest we try to
get back to Germany.

1:34:03.078 --> 1:34:03.910
- Yes.

1:34:06.909 --> 1:34:08.112
- Put him in the house.

1:34:30.972 --> 1:34:34.402
- Klaus I tell you, this
has been a very tough day.

1:34:35.642 --> 1:34:37.141
- Tomorrow will be longer.

1:34:48.356 --> 1:34:50.322
- Over there.

1:34:59.633 --> 1:35:01.763
- General, there's water inside.

1:35:01.799 --> 1:35:03.002
It's an aid station.

1:35:10.039 --> 1:35:11.541
Good to see you again, sir.

1:35:11.576 --> 1:35:12.479
- Well done.

1:35:12.514 --> 1:35:13.980
- Let's have a look at that.

1:35:14.016 --> 1:35:15.315
Would you have a look at the
general's arm here please

1:35:15.350 --> 1:35:16.376
- Quickly though.

1:35:16.412 --> 1:35:18.380
I don't want too much
time away from the men.

1:35:22.159 --> 1:35:23.256
- I understand.

1:35:23.292 --> 1:35:24.356
Right this way.

1:35:24.392 --> 1:35:25.986
- Come sit down.

1:35:26.021 --> 1:35:27.122
- What's the situation?

1:35:27.157 --> 1:35:29.258
- We've been spotted
from the air.

1:35:29.293 --> 1:35:32.233
Last I heard, the beaches
were no longer ours.

1:35:32.268 --> 1:35:33.300
What did you hear?

1:35:33.336 --> 1:35:34.268
- I heard the same.

1:35:34.303 --> 1:35:35.698
- That's not good.

1:35:35.734 --> 1:35:36.838
- It is not indeed.

1:35:37.805 --> 1:35:39.166
We'll have shelter
for the moment.

1:35:39.202 --> 1:35:40.976
Spend the best of
it and regroup.

1:35:41.011 --> 1:35:41.843
- Right.

1:35:42.905 --> 1:35:43.944
- Stay with us.

1:35:45.777 --> 1:35:47.380
- I've got the morphine.

1:35:47.415 --> 1:35:48.811
- Thank you, Mike.

1:35:52.081 --> 1:35:55.054
- Airplane, airplane.

1:35:56.724 --> 1:35:58.151
- Get everything
under the trees.

1:35:58.187 --> 1:36:00.393
Under the trees,
everything, now.

1:36:11.505 --> 1:36:12.440
- Take cover.

1:36:12.475 --> 1:36:14.605
Take cover, under the trees now.

1:36:32.659 --> 1:36:34.495
- Captain, Captain.

1:36:34.530 --> 1:36:36.062
American tanks on the road.

1:36:36.730 --> 1:36:38.129
- That's your department.

1:36:38.164 --> 1:36:39.964
- Do you wanna come
along for the ride Klaus?

1:36:39.999 --> 1:36:41.433
- No, I take my
chance on the ground.

1:36:41.468 --> 1:36:42.665
- Good luck.

1:36:42.701 --> 1:36:43.500
- See you after.

1:36:43.535 --> 1:36:44.367
- Yeah.

1:36:57.520 --> 1:36:59.017
- What will happen to us?

1:36:59.053 --> 1:37:01.450
- These are the Americans,
not the Russians.

1:37:09.793 --> 1:37:10.696
- Captain.

1:37:10.731 --> 1:37:11.933
- What's going on out there?

1:37:16.671 --> 1:37:17.604
- We're holding the bridge here,

1:37:17.639 --> 1:37:18.767
but we don't have enough men.

1:37:18.802 --> 1:37:20.274
I need help.

1:37:22.077 --> 1:37:24.576
- We have two tank destroyers
that are in the woods,

1:37:24.612 --> 1:37:25.907
waiting for defense.

1:37:25.943 --> 1:37:27.414
- Go bring them in.

1:37:27.449 --> 1:37:28.442
They're over here.

1:37:28.477 --> 1:37:30.178
Bring one in for the
defense of the village.

1:37:30.214 --> 1:37:31.716
Send the other
one to the bridge.

1:37:31.752 --> 1:37:33.383
- We can, we can do that.

1:37:33.418 --> 1:37:35.187
- If we can hold long
enough to get the civilians

1:37:35.222 --> 1:37:38.392
and the wounded out of the
village, there's a chance.

1:37:38.428 --> 1:37:39.592
- My men can do it.

1:37:39.627 --> 1:37:41.061
- Let's make it happen.

1:37:43.465 --> 1:37:44.427
- Off kids, Lewis.

1:37:48.768 --> 1:37:50.103
- Get him up that road.

1:38:21.267 --> 1:38:24.300
- I sure ain't giving
up that place easily.

1:38:24.335 --> 1:38:26.173
- City brass hanging
around up in there?

1:38:26.208 --> 1:38:28.508
- Yeah, there was some, but
they've already lost one tank.

1:38:28.544 --> 1:38:29.637
We'll get in there.

1:38:33.110 --> 1:38:34.277
- Man, they're surrounded.

1:38:34.312 --> 1:38:35.542
What the hell do they
keep fighting for?

1:38:35.578 --> 1:38:37.850
- Probably 'cause they're
arrogant bastards.

1:38:37.886 --> 1:38:40.217
Look, let's just
call the air core.

1:38:40.252 --> 1:38:42.687
Have 'em come in,
flat the fucking place

1:38:42.723 --> 1:38:43.890
and be done with it.

1:38:43.925 --> 1:38:45.585
- Now look, there's
some of the guys

1:38:45.620 --> 1:38:48.162
already seen nurses
running around in there.

1:38:48.197 --> 1:38:50.828
- I'm not gonna be the guy
that kills a bunch of nurses.

1:38:50.863 --> 1:38:52.363
Even if they are krauts.

1:38:53.063 --> 1:38:54.335
- I'll tell you what?

1:38:54.371 --> 1:38:55.601
We take a squad.

1:38:55.636 --> 1:38:57.133
Flanking maneuver.

1:38:57.169 --> 1:38:58.639
We'll go around
through the back,

1:38:58.674 --> 1:39:00.139
come up through the middle,

1:39:00.175 --> 1:39:02.670
cut the bastards in half,
or make 'em surrender.

1:39:06.847 --> 1:39:08.580
- Yeah, I'll go with you.

1:39:08.616 --> 1:39:09.845
- Outstanding.

1:39:09.881 --> 1:39:11.115
- Let's do it.

1:39:11.151 --> 1:39:12.451
- They'll take any
unnecessary chances.

1:39:12.486 --> 1:39:13.621
- Right?

1:39:13.656 --> 1:39:14.750
- Like it should in the war.

1:39:14.786 --> 1:39:15.588
- Ballsy.

1:39:15.624 --> 1:39:17.355
Stupid, but ballsy.

1:39:24.532 --> 1:39:25.429
- Get that.

1:39:44.048 --> 1:39:45.451
- I need a scout up here

1:39:45.486 --> 1:39:46.818
You go.

1:39:46.853 --> 1:39:47.985
Keep it on that post.

1:39:48.020 --> 1:39:48.953
When you see them, let me know.

1:39:48.988 --> 1:39:50.887
- We'll come back and get you.

1:39:51.921 --> 1:39:52.753
What?

1:39:57.226 --> 1:39:58.627
All right, let's do it.

1:40:03.332 --> 1:40:05.040
Let's clear this area right now.

1:40:17.587 --> 1:40:18.878
Shoot down that road.

1:40:18.914 --> 1:40:22.049
We're gonna get online with
the rest of the infantry.

1:40:38.606 --> 1:40:39.602
- Pull back.

1:40:40.336 --> 1:40:43.177
- There they're at 20 meters.

1:40:56.691 --> 1:40:58.390
- Get on the back.

1:41:04.830 --> 1:41:05.661
- Out out.

1:41:09.266 --> 1:41:13.240
- Hey, in here.

1:41:25.655 --> 1:41:26.550
- You come with me.

1:41:41.969 --> 1:41:44.238
Don't let 'em in the village.

1:42:13.998 --> 1:42:14.829
- Go, go.

1:42:17.132 --> 1:42:18.173
Go.

1:42:18.971 --> 1:42:20.406
Go, go, now go.

1:42:23.512 --> 1:42:24.240
- Klaus

1:42:24.275 --> 1:42:25.073
- Take the general to safety.

1:42:25.108 --> 1:42:25.911
- Hurry up.

1:42:25.946 --> 1:42:27.582
- Take him out of here.

1:43:55.737 --> 1:43:56.700
- Let's go.

1:44:08.717 --> 1:44:09.811
- Colonel.

1:44:09.847 --> 1:44:11.618
Colonel, I would ask that
you accept my surrender.

1:44:11.654 --> 1:44:12.485
- I will.

1:44:31.301 --> 1:44:32.805
- Hey Lieutenant.

1:44:32.841 --> 1:44:34.438
- Hello Major.

1:44:34.473 --> 1:44:36.377
- Glad to see you're
still with us.

1:44:37.746 --> 1:44:38.338
- Yes, sir.

1:44:38.374 --> 1:44:39.275
Glad to be here.

1:44:39.311 --> 1:44:40.477
- If you hop in back here,

1:44:40.512 --> 1:44:41.542
we're gonna run down
the road and see

1:44:41.577 --> 1:44:42.777
if Jerry's got a line set up.

1:44:42.812 --> 1:44:44.544
Or if they're still
running like rabbits.

1:44:44.579 --> 1:44:46.321
- Outstanding, will do.

1:44:47.522 --> 1:44:48.887
- It'll be all right son,
medics are on the way.

1:44:48.923 --> 1:44:50.253
- I'll be fine.

1:44:55.330 --> 1:44:56.458
- Do you know where
the hell you're going?

1:44:56.493 --> 1:44:58.394
Don't fall off there airborne.

1:44:58.429 --> 1:45:00.060
- I made it first before you--

1:45:00.995 --> 1:45:04.498
- You know you could
always get off and walk.

1:45:22.451 --> 1:45:23.523
- Is that loaded?

1:45:26.963 --> 1:45:28.396
Hit that tank over there.

1:45:29.866 --> 1:45:31.025
But wait for my signal.

1:45:39.909 --> 1:45:41.101
Wait for my signal.

1:45:56.618 --> 1:45:58.218
- Hey, we got one there.

1:45:58.254 --> 1:45:59.086
Hey.

1:46:34.556 --> 1:46:36.763
- Get up, get up.

1:46:36.798 --> 1:46:37.630
Come on.

1:46:39.834 --> 1:46:40.666
Oh God.

1:46:44.336 --> 1:46:45.605
- I know that voice.

1:46:46.570 --> 1:46:47.904
- I'm glad you're not dead.

1:46:51.046 --> 1:46:53.775
What are you doing here?

1:46:53.810 --> 1:46:56.743
Well, since you
decided to get yourself

1:46:56.778 --> 1:46:58.453
blown up in Russia with me,

1:46:59.619 --> 1:47:02.418
we got sent to the same
hospital in France.

1:47:02.453 --> 1:47:04.118
Not that you remember.

1:47:05.756 --> 1:47:07.687
- It's hard to
remember a damn thing.

1:47:07.722 --> 1:47:09.789
Not even your ugly face.

1:47:09.824 --> 1:47:11.565
- It's good to see you too.

1:47:17.303 --> 1:47:18.873
Let's get outta here.

1:47:18.908 --> 1:47:19.804
- What do you see?

1:47:28.143 --> 1:47:32.052
- Americans on one side,
British on the others.

1:47:32.087 --> 1:47:33.114
along there, Germans.

1:47:34.253 --> 1:47:35.116
- No Russians?

1:47:36.286 --> 1:47:37.419
- No.

1:47:37.455 --> 1:47:38.658
- That will be okay.

1:47:39.424 --> 1:47:40.627
- You're optimistic.

1:47:42.295 --> 1:47:44.128
- It'll be just fine.

1:47:54.204 --> 1:47:57.375
The Americans will shoot up
anything moving on the ground.

1:47:57.410 --> 1:47:59.008
- Well, except one of their own.

1:48:11.159 --> 1:48:13.486
- You mean like a jeep?

1:48:13.521 --> 1:48:14.562
- Yep.

1:48:16.495 --> 1:48:17.824
- You wanna hand me that sir?

1:48:17.859 --> 1:48:19.633
- Here, hold this for a minute.

1:48:21.265 --> 1:48:22.097
- Yeah.

1:48:25.602 --> 1:48:27.641
- Well, this is smart.

1:48:29.111 --> 1:48:30.006
- We need a diversion.

1:48:31.477 --> 1:48:33.075
- So we started here, sir.

1:48:41.024 --> 1:48:42.417
- The hell was that?

1:48:42.453 --> 1:48:43.352
Was that ours?

1:48:43.388 --> 1:48:45.156
- No, can't be.

1:48:45.191 --> 1:48:46.022
- Let's go.

1:48:50.396 --> 1:48:51.426
- You know I heard--

1:48:51.462 --> 1:48:52.633
- Nick Sheeson?

1:48:55.630 --> 1:48:57.101
- Oh, shit.

1:48:57.137 --> 1:48:58.402
Cigarette?

1:48:58.437 --> 1:48:59.937
- Smoking's bad for you.

1:49:02.871 --> 1:49:04.242
Major, if you don't mind,

1:49:04.277 --> 1:49:05.173
I need your jeep.

1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:14.820
- Wait, I know you.

1:49:18.989 --> 1:49:21.059
- I'm just another
ugly kraut to you, yes?

1:49:21.094 --> 1:49:22.196
- No.

1:49:22.231 --> 1:49:23.890
- You were on the motorcycle.

1:49:23.925 --> 1:49:26.029
You almost ran over my ass.

1:49:27.971 --> 1:49:28.933
- That was you?

1:49:30.105 --> 1:49:31.203
I'm very sorry.

1:49:31.238 --> 1:49:32.200
I didn't mean to.

1:49:33.101 --> 1:49:35.005
- What are you
talking about Klaus?

1:49:36.379 --> 1:49:38.041
- Take care of
yourself Sergeant.

1:49:39.114 --> 1:49:40.043
- You too, sir.

1:49:41.180 --> 1:49:41.874
- Major.

1:49:41.910 --> 1:49:43.618
- Come on Klaus, let's go.

1:49:59.267 --> 1:50:00.065
- What do you think?

1:50:00.100 --> 1:50:00.693
Go east?

1:50:00.729 --> 1:50:01.768
- Let's go east.

1:50:03.035 --> 1:50:05.832
- You wanna tell me what
the hell that was all about?

1:50:13.281 --> 1:50:14.306
- Sir, that is a story

1:50:14.342 --> 1:50:17.451
I'll definitely share
with my grandchildren.

- We got a long walk
and I'm all ears.

1:50:19.049 --> 1:50:21.084
- Yeah, that's a story
I'd like to hear.
