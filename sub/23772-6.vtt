WEBVTT

00:08.360 --> 00:09.950
You're so annoying.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.600
Hurry up, bell's gone.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074

00:31.640 --> 00:35.590
- Blimey, lunch at nine? That
even beats my record. - Hungry.

00:35.640 --> 00:39.640
- Ten past nine. You're late,
Rose. Got an excuse? - No.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.510
Crikey, have you finally
cracked and topped Limahl?

00:49.080 --> 00:51.950
No, no, I haven't. Just please ignore me.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.750
No, really, Ingrid, what's in there?

00:53.800 --> 00:55.390
Mind your own fucking business!

00:55.440 --> 00:56.750
Ooh!

00:56.800 --> 00:59.790
Oh, right. Well, you leave me
with no alternative other than

00:59.840 --> 01:03.840
to break out the never before
deployed howling face red sticker.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.630
Late with insubordination.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.110
Oh, Ingrid!

01:08.160 --> 01:12.410
Ah, Adrian. Now, L is for
lamentable, A is for for abominable,

01:12.460 --> 01:15.190
T is for a terrible and E is
for early which you are not.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.990
Please, don't make me spell it out again.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.630
- Oh, God. - What's that?
Abusive text from Denise's ex?

01:22.680 --> 01:25.750
No, it's not Crazy Hazel from Bulky Waste.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.350
No, I told Lee about Dennis last night

01:28.400 --> 01:30.750
and I completely misjudged his reaction.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.990
Don't tell me, it was like that actress

01:33.040 --> 01:35.510
sob-snotting in Truly, Madly, Deeply.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.830
- Well, I didn't think he'd give a shit.
- Rose, Rose, Rose,

01:37.880 --> 01:39.430
you know so little of the male psyche.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.910
Oh, enlighten me, great
testosterone telepath!

01:41.960 --> 01:45.110
Well, Lee might be thinking you're
going to make a go of it with him

01:45.160 --> 01:47.470
and even if he didn't want you
he can't bear to think of you

01:47.520 --> 01:48.750
in the arms of another.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.030
Oh, well, big wobbly bollocks
to him. He can piss off.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.710
Nat, you know I said I was
doing something for you?

01:54.760 --> 01:58.760
- Oh, not buying sweets, then?
- You shouldn't be eating sweets.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.270
Indeed, sugar generally
is really bad for you

02:02.320 --> 02:05.350
and there are things you need to
be doing to prevent your child

02:05.400 --> 02:08.270
from becoming severely disabled
or, potentially, a vegetable.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.320
- Like a potato?
- No, that, to some extent, is why I have

02:12.960 --> 02:16.960
compiled your health and wellbeing
dossier with lots of advice.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.670
Gut flora and pregnancy.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.710
"Moz... art" and your "foitis"?

02:24.760 --> 02:26.950
Anyway, take your time to absorb it,

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
like mercury through
the umbilical cord, ha!

02:33.760 --> 02:36.310
And then we'll have an
informal quiz later on today.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.070
I'm just doing it for the baby,
Nat, because someone's got to.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.670
- Are you feeling broody?
- Oh, God, no. There are...

02:41.720 --> 02:44.870
I've got lots of lovely ladies
to please before I find the one.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.550
But, anyway, back to your diet.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.150
I see the father hasn't
stopped you guzzling sugar

02:49.200 --> 02:51.790
- or taking no exercise.
- He really cares about me.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.840
- Yesterday...
- Oh, there's my phone.

02:57.480 --> 03:00.070
Hello, Elm Heath Children's Services.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.230
Who's this?

03:01.280 --> 03:04.350
(It's Al. Shall we have that
chat with Professor Plum)

03:04.400 --> 03:07.390
in the conservatory today?

03:07.440 --> 03:11.440
- What? - It's code, you fuckwit.
We talked about it yesterday.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.750
Oh!

03:13.800 --> 03:15.030
Yes.

03:15.080 --> 03:19.080
Yes, the eagle has landed, or will land.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.590
November India Tango India November?

03:23.640 --> 03:26.310
- What?
- Well, it's code, you fuckwit!

03:26.360 --> 03:29.230
- It's Matthew Wenden here from
Our Lady... - Oh, Mr Wenden!

03:29.280 --> 03:32.470
- How can I help you? - Just get
down here as soon as you can, please.

03:32.520 --> 03:36.520
Right, I will be there immediately.

03:41.400 --> 03:45.400
Knobhead.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.720
Nat! Put the doughnut in the bin.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.600
Put it in the bin! Come on,
it's for your own good.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.070
Oh, forget it.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.470
Elm Heath Children's
Services, can I help you?

04:01.480 --> 04:02.750
Anybody there?

04:04.800 --> 04:05.830
Hello?

04:05.880 --> 04:08.710
I'm wondering, is it illegal
to fake your own death

04:08.760 --> 04:10.310
to get away from your kids?

04:11.360 --> 04:13.990
You two! Fucking shut
up, I'm on the phone!

04:14.040 --> 04:16.829
Just had a call about some Mormon family

04:16.880 --> 04:20.029
who were home-educating their
kids a couple of years ago

04:20.079 --> 04:22.230
that we were meant to
be keeping an eye on?

04:22.280 --> 04:23.950
Oh, yeah, I remember them.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.870
A relative thinks the parents
aren't really doing the job,

04:26.920 --> 04:28.030
but no-one's noticed.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.780
I might pop round there and check.

04:33.120 --> 04:36.030
- Text from your boyfriend?
- No, it's a picture of your cock!

04:36.080 --> 04:38.270
Actual size on that phone, I imagine.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.360
- How is Dennis the Menace?
- It's so nice spending time with someone

04:43.520 --> 04:47.190
not wanting to rip off their scrotum
and create a collage with it.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.430
- Serious?
- Ugh, I don't know.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.630
I try not to think about it.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.230
So, how's the job hunt going?

04:53.280 --> 04:56.590
I wasn't going to tell you, but...

04:56.640 --> 04:58.230
- .. I've had a job offer.
- What?

04:58.280 --> 05:01.630
Managing holiday cottages
on a remote Scottish island.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.070
- No!
- Well, I need a new challenge.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.470
Or just at least a happy work life

05:06.520 --> 05:08.590
because this is really getting to me.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.550
Well, you could get
married and start a family

05:11.600 --> 05:15.600
before your sperm get Alzheimer's
and don't know which way to go.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.510
I'm handing in my notice today.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.150
River Barrett? It doesn't ring a bell.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.070
- She's how old?
- 14.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.070
- And she gave birth in the
loo. - Yes. - Poor kid.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.270
Didn't even know she was
pregnant, apparently.

05:30.320 --> 05:34.320
- Well, how's that possible?
- You tell me.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.520
I ca.. I can't. Why would I be able
to tell you? I... I don't have...

05:38.600 --> 05:41.670
It was rhetorical.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.830
- OK, how's she doing?
- Well, they're keeping her in

05:43.880 --> 05:47.150
for a couple of nights
just to check all's well.

05:47.200 --> 05:50.030
Good. Good, that gives us
a chance to make a plan.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.070
- Yeah. - So we need to find out if the
parents are helping her and, if not,

05:53.120 --> 05:56.190
then we need to explore sending her
to a supported mother and baby unit

05:56.240 --> 05:59.190
or perhaps finding specialist
foster parents for her.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.590
Have you managed to get in touch
with any of the parents, relatives?

06:02.640 --> 06:06.640
Not yet, no. I wondered perhaps
if you might like to contact them.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.270
What's the mother's name? Barrett, is it?

06:09.320 --> 06:12.190
No, she's been married
a few times since then.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.910
It's now...

06:13.960 --> 06:16.870
- Shaz Middleton.
- Shaz Middleton? - Yeah.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.670
Oh, my fucking God.

06:21.220 --> 06:22.150
Sorry.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.950
She's a legendary nightmare.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.870
Not sure I've ever met her.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.710
She's not the type to
come to parents' evening.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.070
Hopefully, because she's in jail.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.950
Rose is going to have a bloody fit.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.350
Shaz Middleton was the
bane of her life for years.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.190
When she went down for GBH,
Rose broke open the bubbly.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.310
Chaps!

06:44.360 --> 06:48.360
What's this, a union meeting? Ha!

06:48.680 --> 06:51.790
- Can we have a little chat?
- Oh, that's a bit serious.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.350
Well, spit it out.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.630
You and me meet at your flat.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.670
Everyone thinks it's perverted and creepy.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.390
Well, you certainly did spit that out.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.790
People are talking.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.670
Yes, I know.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.510
Probably time I had a word.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.670
- Doughnut?
- What?

07:08.720 --> 07:11.550
Would either of you like a
doughnut? I've brought some in.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.950
Hi. Hannah, isn't it?

07:35.000 --> 07:38.990
- Yeah. - I'm Rose Denby,
from Social Services.

07:39.040 --> 07:43.040
I'm sorry, I realise that no-one's
been to see you for a long time.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.190
That's all right. We've been fine.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.390
Is it all right if I just come
in and say hello to the children?

07:48.440 --> 07:52.440
Yeah.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.070
Jesus wept.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.030
John, chapter 11, verse 35.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.630
What do you mean?

08:02.680 --> 08:06.680
"Jesus wept" is the shortest
verse in the New Testament.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.710
- What are you both doing?
- We are doing Bible study.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.270
How often do you do that?

08:12.320 --> 08:13.750
Once a day.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.310
- For how long?
- For all day.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.030
- You don't go to the park? - No. - No.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.590
- Sport?
- No.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.550
- Blimey. - That means
"blind me" and is a profanity.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.190
Christ.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.240
Sorry. Can we have a word?

08:31.360 --> 08:34.590
Arms up, breathe in.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.630
Arms down, breathe out.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.510
Aw, that's complicated.

08:39.559 --> 08:43.559
Arm up, breathe out.
arm down, breathe out.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.630
- Oh, thank God. - Oh! - Thank you, God.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.470
No, it's fine, Ingrid. Just keep
trying, Nat, you're doing slightly

08:50.520 --> 08:54.150
better than you did at the
beginning of the session.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.600
Everything all right, Ingrid?

08:57.400 --> 09:00.390
Wow, Ingrid, that really
is a massive trolley.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.630
- Promise you won't tell anybody?
- What, that your trolley's massive?

09:03.680 --> 09:07.550
- No, look.
- So what? Boring old files.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.790
It's the missing files.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.470
Ha-ha, very funny.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.630
- Look.
- What happened?

09:14.680 --> 09:17.590
Well, when we moved office I was
supposed to help digitalise them,

09:17.640 --> 09:20.550
but I got a bit muddled and so
I brought a load of them home

09:20.600 --> 09:23.830
to sort out but then my
anxiety got really bad and...

09:23.880 --> 09:26.870
So I just shoved them up in the
attic and forgot about them.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.590
So how come you remembered them?

09:28.640 --> 09:31.270
Well, Limahl sometimes
goes up to the attic to...

09:31.320 --> 09:33.030
Oh, I use the airing cupboard.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.430
To masturbate?

09:34.480 --> 09:37.550
No, to have a little
cry when I'm emotional.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.150
Oh, well, I went up there
to clear up his mess

09:40.200 --> 09:43.950
and I noticed all the boxes of files.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.590
Have you told Denise?

09:45.640 --> 09:48.630
Now, I know how much you wanted
to be the one that found them

09:48.680 --> 09:52.680
- so I wondered if you wanted
to tell her? - Really? Cool!

09:53.480 --> 09:55.750
I'll have to think of a
believable place I've found them.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.950
Maybe your attic?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.350
No.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.150
Of course. Um.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.830
My attic? No, I haven't got one.

10:01.880 --> 10:05.630
Never mind, I'll think of something.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.680
Right, we've got a lot to get
through today. Let's push on.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.070
Rose, what have you got?

10:11.120 --> 10:15.110
- Uh, Denise, could I say something?
- You already did. Rose?

10:15.160 --> 10:17.750
Well, I visited a family
today, a Mormon family.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.590
The children are being home-schooled.

10:19.640 --> 10:23.640
The house was spotless, the children
were clean and well-dressed, but...

10:23.760 --> 10:25.150
Moving on.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.990
But I felt there was something
a bit weird and sterile,

10:29.040 --> 10:31.110
a sense of foreboding.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.990
Rose, just make a bloody decision.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.390
School Attendance Order
if you like or leave them

10:35.440 --> 10:38.070
to baste in fevered fundamentalism.
Whatever. Just sort it.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.070
You wouldn't say that
about a Muslim family.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.070
OK. Can we just move on to me?

10:42.120 --> 10:44.710
I got a call from Mr Wenden this morning

10:44.760 --> 10:46.990
who's the head teacher at Our Lady Academy

10:47.040 --> 10:49.270
to tell me that an incident
had occurred, so...

10:49.320 --> 10:50.630
Oh, for Christ's sake, Nitin,

10:50.680 --> 10:53.070
this isn't a performance
of social workers' Hansard.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.710
In a nutshell, please.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.710
A 14-year-old girl had a baby
in a toilet at the school.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.670
The girl's River Barrett. She's
the daughter of Shaz Middleton.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.430
She's not out, is she?
That's all I bloody need.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.070
- Denise?
- Shut up, Nat. She's out?

11:07.120 --> 11:10.150
Well, I think if she's out
that's something to be celebrated.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.430
Denise is referring to
her being out of prison.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.430
She went there on the evidence
of our very own Rose Denby.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.910
Interesting fact, 60% of prison
inmates do tend to reoffend.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.430
Well, OK, thanks.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.990
Especially the ones called Shaz.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.750
You'll need a stab vest.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.630
- A stab vest?
- You should wear a stab vest.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.630
Denise?

11:29.680 --> 11:31.590
I found the missing files!

11:31.640 --> 11:33.270
Oh, well done!

11:33.320 --> 11:36.830
Oh, God, I thought you
were having another baby.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.790
They can't get another
one in now, can they?

11:38.840 --> 11:40.910
Once you've got one,
that's your womb occupied.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.470
- Yeah, I know that.
- Where did you find them?

11:43.520 --> 11:45.390
- In the haunted toilet.
- Good grief.

11:45.440 --> 11:49.310
- Elaborate, please. - Yeah, well,
you know the toilet that's been locked

11:49.360 --> 11:52.510
since we got here? Al told me
it was because it was haunted.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.150
Look, leave it and I'll sort them.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.070
I've moved them all into the stock
cupboard on Ingrid's massive trolley

11:58.120 --> 11:59.710
- because of the ghost.
- There is no ghost!

11:59.760 --> 12:01.830
I'll have a good look
through them, Denise,

12:01.880 --> 12:04.350
see if I can find the
relevant files to clear up

12:04.400 --> 12:06.750
the Elm Heath Strollers
football coach allegation.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.190
Did you not hear what I said?
Leave them alone. I will sort them.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.370
Shit, sorry!

12:13.920 --> 12:16.390
I should have sacked her
when I had the chance.

12:16.440 --> 12:20.440
Now I'm saddled with her
fucking maternity package.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.150
Too harsh?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.790
- No. - No. - Mimi, could you
take over the notes, please?

12:24.840 --> 12:27.270
I think you'll find I don't
tend to do secretarial work.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.630
Well, could you tend to do
it just for today, please?

12:29.680 --> 12:33.680
- So, Alistair. - I've just had a call
from Mr Lady at Our Wenden Academy.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.070
Reverse.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.470
No, no, no. Reverse the names.

12:39.520 --> 12:43.230
Mr Wenden at Our Lady Academy. What
did he say that was so important?

12:43.280 --> 12:46.110
Er, he said that River Barrett
has run away from hospital

12:46.160 --> 12:49.610
- and taken the baby with her.
- Shit!

12:58.240 --> 12:59.750
There you are, I've been...

12:59.800 --> 13:02.430
You all right?

13:02.480 --> 13:04.670
Um, the file?

13:04.720 --> 13:08.720
- What are you...
- Martin, Martin, don't!

13:09.040 --> 13:10.990
Oh, my giddy aunt!

13:11.040 --> 13:14.350
"Darren Galloway is a known fantasist,
according to several other boys,

13:14.400 --> 13:17.470
"therefore it's hard not to conclude
that said abuse is a figment of his

13:17.520 --> 13:21.110
"imagination. In short, I find him
to be unreliable and in no way a

13:21.160 --> 13:25.150
"credible witness. Yours
sincerely, Denise Donnelly."

13:25.200 --> 13:28.270
I need that bloody thing to
disappear. I want it to disappear.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.110
No, no, no.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.070
I mean, what are you doing? You
can't destroy public records!

13:33.120 --> 13:35.910
- That would be...
- I know, Martin! I know what it would be.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.670
But, please, I'm begging you,

13:37.720 --> 13:41.720
don't say anything until
I've had a chance to think.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.120
Hiya, I've come to see Shaz.
It's about her daughter, River?

13:54.680 --> 13:57.550
And you are?

13:57.600 --> 14:01.600
Yeah, I'm Al Kavanagh,
from Social Services.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.150
All right, mate.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.670
Come in.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.720
- Social services.
- What?

14:12.240 --> 14:16.240
- All right, Shaz? - Yeah, if it isn't
Mr Curly Cocksucker from the SS.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.030
So, how's Rose doing?

14:19.080 --> 14:23.080
Rose is fine, so... let's try
and keep it that way, shall we?

14:23.240 --> 14:26.110
Try to be nice, Shaz.
Remember what I said.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.310
Sorry, love. What can I do for you?

14:29.360 --> 14:32.630
- I'm looking for River.
- Well, River ain't here, so ta-ra.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.230
Shaz, this is important.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.670
She's just given birth. She needs
attention. She's left hospital way

14:38.720 --> 14:42.510
too soon for the staff
to be sure she's OK.

14:42.560 --> 14:45.830
Shaz, you would tell me wouldn't
you, if you knew where River was?

14:45.880 --> 14:47.950
Yes, of course.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.310
All right? Now, off you go.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.350
- What's that?
- That's nothing.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.790
It's a dog. It's got an infection.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.190
Now, do one.

15:01.240 --> 15:05.110
That's a person. That is a person in pain.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.950
- Oi! Oi!
- Go after him!

15:12.000 --> 15:15.470
Let's just hope she don't declare us, eh?

15:15.520 --> 15:17.190
River?

15:17.240 --> 15:20.950
- Oh, my God.
- I'm going to die, aren't I?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.870
You're not going to die. I'm going
to... I'm calling the ambulance now.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.510
- I don't want to give my
baby to that prick! - What?

15:29.080 --> 15:32.150
Listen, someone's going to come,
OK? Someone's going to come.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.630
- Yeah, Ambulance, please.
- This is all your fault, you know that?

15:38.680 --> 15:41.630
- Oh, shut up, woman! - Oh, fuck
off! - I'm calling an Ambulance.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.590
- You ain't taking her!
- For fuck's sake!

15:43.640 --> 15:46.470
You want to be responsible for
killing your own fucking daughter?

15:46.520 --> 15:49.790
Is that what you want?

15:49.840 --> 15:52.590
Al's on his way back.
He's found River Barrett.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.870
Oh. Hmm. Thank goodness for small mercies.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.750
- You want a hand?
- No, thanks.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.800
But now that you're here, there is
something that we ought to sort out.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.950
Um... You've been staying at mine,

16:06.000 --> 16:09.630
rent-free, for a while now, bless you.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.630
Um, thing is, I can't afford it forever.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.070
Plus, believe it or not,
people are starting to talk.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.110
- The patriarchy always get...
- Mimi, Mimi, please.

16:20.160 --> 16:24.160
Just for once, stop hiding
behind all that stuff.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.630
Sorry! I'm sorry.

16:26.680 --> 16:30.680
I'm sorry. I've been very stressed
with all the extra responsibility.

16:31.120 --> 16:35.120
Look, my mum thinks I've
got a proper paid job.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.630
All right, I told her
I did, to impress her.

16:37.680 --> 16:40.190
And then she asked me to move out
so that she could rent the room,

16:40.240 --> 16:43.510
cos she's broke. And now I feel like a shit
feminist because apparently I need a man

16:43.560 --> 16:47.070
- to look after me! - OK, well, look,
now, I'm sorry I broached the subject.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.150
Stay as long as you like. And don't worry,

16:50.200 --> 16:53.070
I've, uh, I've got some premium bonds.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.630
I don't know what those
are, but thank you.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.110
And you know what, Mimi?

16:57.160 --> 17:01.160
You could help your case around here
by being just a little less earnest.

17:01.600 --> 17:05.599
Why don't you try to
just... lighten up a bit?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.790
That sort of thing, yes.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.829
'Hi, Denise. Jenny thingy for
you. Your boss, I think.'

17:16.880 --> 17:20.880
Yes, thank you, Natalie,
I know who she is.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.589
Hello, Jenny.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.950
Thank you. I was literally
just about call you.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Some old files have turned up that
cover that period of historic abuse

17:33.400 --> 17:37.400
at the football club, and it
appears I may have dealt with a...

17:38.880 --> 17:42.880
- 'Yes, Denise, yes, we are aware
of these and of your...' - Oh.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.270
- 'There will be an immediate enquiry.'
- May I ask who told you?

17:47.320 --> 17:50.670
'No.'

17:50.720 --> 17:52.630
That's all right.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.750
I can imagine.

17:54.800 --> 17:58.550
Apparently you can get 20
grand now for a new baby.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.600
And Shaz knows some local
gangster whose wife can't conceive,

18:02.760 --> 18:06.760
so he puts the word out
that he wants to buy a baby.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.430
So they roped this kid River in,

18:09.480 --> 18:12.070
and they give her five grand and an

18:12.120 --> 18:14.670
underage sex session with Mr Gangster.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.150
- Oh, God. - And after the birth, the
placenta wasn't completely ejected,

18:18.200 --> 18:20.670
and she very quickly
became dangerously ill.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.720
- That's what Mary Wollstonecraft died from.
- Mary Woolycraft?

18:24.920 --> 18:27.950
Yeah, very similar, except
that was in the 18th century.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.910
Yeah, everyone knows Mary
Woolycraft died in 18th century.

18:30.960 --> 18:34.350
- Anyway, would anyone like to go to
the pub? - Yeah, I'm in. - No, thanks.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.950
You'll have to play gooseberry.
I've got a date with Dennis.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
- That little creeping shit!
- Any news?

18:42.640 --> 18:45.150
- Bastard!
- What happened?

18:45.200 --> 18:47.670
Like you don't know.
It was you, wasn't it?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.830
- What? - Traitor! After
all I've done for you.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.670
I stood by you when you
were off your fucking rocker!

18:52.720 --> 18:55.910
Denise! I have not said a word to anyone.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.350
I swear. You've got to believe me!

18:58.400 --> 19:00.310
Are you all right?

19:00.360 --> 19:04.360
Well, obviously not! Anyone else
care to contribute some meaningless

19:04.720 --> 19:08.720
drivel to this discussion? Except Nitin!

19:09.440 --> 19:13.830
'Mr Galloway, how do you feel, now
that you know that Elm Heath Social
Services shut down your case?'

19:13.880 --> 19:15.670
It'd a victory, innit?

19:15.720 --> 19:17.630
Shit, Denise, you've been suspended?

19:17.680 --> 19:21.030
- 'I'm not a liar.'
- Is suspended the same as sacked?

19:21.080 --> 19:23.670
'I told people what happened
then, nobody listened...'

19:23.720 --> 19:26.790
I would like to just say, none of
you know what it was like back then!

19:26.840 --> 19:30.310
We were hated. We were seen as amateurs.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.190
We were drowning in work!

19:32.240 --> 19:34.870
Do you honestly think
anything has changed?

19:34.920 --> 19:36.910
The cuts are driving us to breaking point!

19:36.960 --> 19:39.630
I feel like I'm going round
a World War I battlefield

19:39.680 --> 19:41.290
with some Calpol and a wet wipe.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.910
Fucking Hazel! It was her!

19:46.960 --> 19:49.590
Alistair? I'm going on a break!

19:49.640 --> 19:52.310
You and Martin can take
over in the interim.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.070
- Good luck!
- Denise, I'm handing in my notice...

19:55.120 --> 19:58.950
Good luck! Come on,
everybody, start celebrating!

19:59.000 --> 20:00.300
Hurrah!

20:03.360 --> 20:07.360
Oh, this fucking, shitting door!

20:08.680 --> 20:11.990
It's all right, Denise,
I changed the code there.

20:12.040 --> 20:16.030
You OK, Mart? You could
do with a drink, eh?

20:16.080 --> 20:19.350
You know what, I'm feeling a
bit too choked. You all go.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.670
If we go home and watch a film together?

20:21.720 --> 20:24.030
Yes, a lovely idea, Mimi.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.990
"Netflix and chill."

20:26.040 --> 20:30.040
Martin, "Netflix and chill" means
to watch half a film and then have

20:30.120 --> 20:34.120
- rampant sex.
- What? No, it doesn't. What? Well, I,

20:34.760 --> 20:37.870
I mean, you know, just watching
together, the film, or something.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.920
Popcorn between us. Just the usual.
We'll be all right. Catch you...

20:47.280 --> 20:49.990
She's on her fourth brandy and Babycham.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.110
Hazel's really dumped her in it.

20:52.160 --> 20:56.160
- Oh, cheer up. - I bought a
windcheater and some special gloves.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.550
Yeah, but you don't belong
up there, you belong here.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.630
- Christ, I'll be the boss now.
- Eewww, yeah.

21:02.680 --> 21:06.590
- Another one?
- Yeah.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.470
- Cheer up, Denise.
- Fuck off, Alistair.

21:09.520 --> 21:12.190
All right? Hey.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.510
- Hello, Rose.
- Oh, hi.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.760
Come on, she's not that bad!

21:20.040 --> 21:21.590
What happened?

21:21.640 --> 21:24.030
- Suspended.
- Oh, Christ!

21:24.080 --> 21:26.750
- I'll go chat to her in a sec.
- Oh, Rose!

21:26.800 --> 21:29.830
- God. - We're all waiting at home,
I've cooked your favourite dinner.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.470
- Why?
- It's our anniversary.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.550
- No, it isn't.
- Of when we first met.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.870
- Pint, please.
- Tosser.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.790
Look, I'm going to shoot.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.110
- Oh, no.
- My first marriage broke up,

21:43.160 --> 21:47.030
I don't want to be the guy that
does that to another family.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.670
Please stay. I've no idea
why Lee is doing this.

21:50.720 --> 21:54.190
Right. Now, Rose...

21:54.240 --> 21:56.510
I want this to work.

21:56.560 --> 22:00.560
For the sake of the kids!

22:00.800 --> 22:04.190
Oh.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.390
Mum, please.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.830
- Dad's wonderful. - Right, come
on, the, let's all go and sit over

22:10.880 --> 22:13.350
there and we'll get you
drinks in a moment.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.910
That's it. Right. Who wants what, then?

22:16.960 --> 22:19.390
- I want a fizzy orange and
a packet of nuts. - Lee! Lee!

22:19.440 --> 22:21.630
What do you think you're doing?

22:21.680 --> 22:24.630
It's inappropriate for them to be in
the pub. Take them back to the car.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.870
- All right. Sorry.
- Dad, you said we were having a drink.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.550
Yes, but Mum says no.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.670
Come on, I'll catch you up. I'm
coming, I'm coming right now.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.710
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.870
Look, Rose, neither of
us is ready for this.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.920
I'm sorry. It's been really great.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.190
- I'll see you around.
- Dennis...?

22:44.240 --> 22:46.430
Come on, stinker, let's get you home.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.150
- Oh, God.
- Put that down, down, down.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.750
- Hi, Denise. - Fuck off. - Bye, Denise.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.590
- There you are.
- My bloke can't come to the birth,

22:56.640 --> 23:00.230
