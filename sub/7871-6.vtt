BASEBALL ANNOUNCER:
It's the World Series, two outs,

01:08.970 --> 01:10.368
bottom of the ninth.

01:10.369 --> 01:11.670
Yes, we're at the point

01:11.704 --> 01:13.972
where baseball becomes
mildly interesting.

01:14.006 --> 01:17.309
Can Homer Simpson,
fresh off an anxiety dream

01:17.343 --> 01:19.344
about not studying
for a high school test,

01:19.378 --> 01:22.547
come into this dream
and knock one out of the park?

01:22.582 --> 01:24.316
And who'da thunk it?

01:24.350 --> 01:25.750
We're food too!

01:25.785 --> 01:28.236
And apparently I'm married
to a pork chop

01:28.271 --> 01:30.405
and have drumstick children.

01:30.439 --> 01:32.407
How did that happen?

01:32.441 --> 01:35.310
(snoring)

01:35.344 --> 01:36.878
BASEBALL ANNOUNCER: We're back...
(belches)

01:36.913 --> 01:39.064
The pitcher,
Steroid Santa Claus,

01:39.098 --> 01:40.699
kicks and deals.

01:40.733 --> 01:43.985
It's a long fly ball,
going back! Back!

01:44.019 --> 01:46.154
And the ball shatters the sky,

01:46.188 --> 01:49.624
bringing the ocean itself
down into the stadium!

01:49.659 --> 01:53.378
Whoa, Simpson just broke this
dream's reality wide open!

01:53.412 --> 01:55.830
The groundskeepers are
trying to put on the tarp,

01:55.864 --> 01:59.384
but it turned into a manta ray
and stung them all.

01:59.418 --> 02:02.070
Now, we'll be right back
after this word from oxygen,

02:02.104 --> 02:04.706
which Homer desperately
needs to live.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.241

MARGE:
Homer! The roof is leaking!

02:12.131 --> 02:13.815
Water's coming in the house,

02:13.849 --> 02:15.650
and we've got carpet mushrooms.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.989
Dad, all the jury summons
you buried in the back yard

02:21.023 --> 02:22.257
are coming back up.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.045
(humming)

02:29.598 --> 02:31.566
While you were out
there daydreaming,

02:31.600 --> 02:33.351
this rain has ruined the house.

02:33.386 --> 02:34.786
(sighs deeply)

02:34.820 --> 02:36.905
Marge, in a crisis like this,

02:36.939 --> 02:39.607
I need time for
quiet contemplation.

02:44.930 --> 02:46.414
What's wrong, Homer?

02:46.432 --> 02:48.633
You got an expression on your
face I ain't never seen before.

02:48.684 --> 02:51.019
Like one of them Charlie Brown
wiggle-frowns.

02:51.053 --> 02:55.190
I'm in an abusive
relationship with life.

02:55.224 --> 02:56.791
It keeps beating
the hell out of me,

02:56.826 --> 02:58.443
and I'm too cowardly
to leave it.

02:58.477 --> 02:59.611
(sighs)

02:59.645 --> 03:01.613
Maybe I could drink myself
to death.

03:01.647 --> 03:02.981
Eh, well, you can't.

03:03.015 --> 03:04.549
Your tolerance is too high.

03:04.583 --> 03:09.454
Man, I've never seen Homer
looking this bad.

03:11.757 --> 03:12.874
You're right.

03:12.908 --> 03:14.893
He needs some
professional help.

03:15.828 --> 03:17.796
♪ Oh yeah...

03:19.498 --> 03:22.667
Ooh, someone is
down in the Duff!

03:22.702 --> 03:25.136
Life is too fragile.

03:25.171 --> 03:27.872
One minute you're lying in
your hammock drinking beer,

03:27.907 --> 03:31.910
the next thing you know you're
sittin' here drinkin' beer.

03:31.944 --> 03:36.314
Homer, your bleak outlook has
sent a smooth, icy chill down...

03:36.348 --> 03:38.483
Ah, screw it. I quit.

03:38.517 --> 03:40.752
Janette, Cheryl,
get your own ride home.

03:44.623 --> 03:47.642
Aw, come on, Chief.
I've had a rotten day.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.927
Can't you help me out?

03:48.961 --> 03:50.795
Sorry, I'm afraid
the most I can do

03:50.830 --> 03:52.230
is pretend to drive you home.

03:52.264 --> 03:55.050
Okay, now hop on my
imaginary motorcycle...

03:55.084 --> 03:56.668
arms around my belly...

03:56.702 --> 03:59.687
(imitates motorcycle revving)

03:59.722 --> 04:02.490
Um, I'm gonna need you
to chip in for gas.

04:02.525 --> 04:03.892
Argh.

04:03.926 --> 04:06.594
This is where
the pretending ends.

04:13.569 --> 04:15.053
Oh...

04:15.087 --> 04:16.254
Now what?

04:16.288 --> 04:18.523
You're coming with us
to the school fundraiser.

04:18.557 --> 04:20.425
Can this day get any worse?

04:20.459 --> 04:21.993
The dog's got the mumps.

04:22.027 --> 04:23.695
Dogs can't get mumps.

04:23.729 --> 04:25.196
Well, then, explain this.

04:25.231 --> 04:27.499
The only thing we know is
it'll cost $800.

04:27.533 --> 04:28.533
Ooh!

04:28.567 --> 04:30.568
(Western music playing)

04:37.993 --> 04:39.761
Willie, I love your chaps.

04:39.795 --> 04:42.080
Me pants are ripped out!

04:43.916 --> 04:46.084
I don't care
for silent auctions.

04:46.118 --> 04:48.553
It just encourages hovering.

04:50.556 --> 04:51.589
Oh...

04:51.624 --> 04:53.224
Mm-hmm...

04:56.245 --> 04:57.745
Oh!

05:00.616 --> 05:02.717
You know you just pushed
it up to list price.

05:02.751 --> 05:04.786
You know that, right?

05:04.820 --> 05:06.521
Edna, I'm not one
for costumes,

05:06.555 --> 05:08.323
but I sure do like that
feather in your hair.

05:08.357 --> 05:12.093
I like how you make me feel good
about the littlest things.

05:13.963 --> 05:15.597
It's just you and me tonight,
Buttermilk.

05:15.631 --> 05:17.282
(imitating hoofbeats)

05:17.333 --> 05:18.533
Whoa.

05:18.567 --> 05:21.503
Howdy, pardners,
I'm much obliged to y'all

05:21.537 --> 05:23.872
for comin' out to
the ol' corral here...

05:23.906 --> 05:24.906
Skinner!

05:24.940 --> 05:27.408
People want to get home!
Speak regular.

05:27.443 --> 05:30.378
Fine, we'll start the raffle and
skip the things no one wants,

05:30.412 --> 05:32.347
like art projects
by your children

05:32.381 --> 05:35.150
or a spaghetti dinner
with the Van Houtens.

05:35.184 --> 05:37.585
So let's get right to the item
I'm sure you're waiting for:

05:37.620 --> 05:39.721
the latest Mapple myPad!

05:39.755 --> 05:41.422
(all exclaiming)

05:41.457 --> 05:43.791
I could do my cyber-bullying
on the bus!

05:43.826 --> 05:46.294
Remember when me gettin'
a cell phone was a big deal?

05:46.328 --> 05:48.863
I bought you a ticket
for the myPad raffle, Dad.

05:48.898 --> 05:51.966
Aw, that's Tooth Fairy money
down the drain, sweetie.

05:52.001 --> 05:53.668
I never win anything.

05:53.702 --> 05:56.571
It's always some stupid jerk
you've never heard of.

05:56.605 --> 05:57.939
And the winner is...

05:57.973 --> 05:59.741
Here it comes...

05:59.775 --> 06:00.742
Homer Simpson!

06:00.776 --> 06:01.809
Get him!

06:01.844 --> 06:03.645
I mean, woo-hoo!

06:03.679 --> 06:05.180
(crowd cheering)

06:05.214 --> 06:08.299
I just want to say I was having
the worst day of my life.

06:08.334 --> 06:09.901
Three cheers for Homer,

06:09.935 --> 06:11.436
minus the one
we gave him already.

06:11.470 --> 06:13.321
(crowd cheers twice)

06:13.355 --> 06:14.722
Okay, what else...

06:14.757 --> 06:16.691
Free Tibet! You heard me!

06:16.725 --> 06:18.660
Free him now!

06:18.694 --> 06:19.961
Thank you.

06:19.995 --> 06:22.363
Oh, my luck has changed!

06:22.398 --> 06:24.148
ANNOUNCER: <i>This is Homer Simpson's</i>

06:34.993 --> 06:37.261
Greetings, I am Steve Mobbs,

06:37.295 --> 06:39.697
welcoming you
from beyond the grave.

06:39.731 --> 06:42.750
I left a half-eaten apple
outside your store...

06:42.784 --> 06:44.952
the greatest tribute of all.

06:44.986 --> 06:48.589
The product you hold is like
a giant expensive smartphone

06:48.623 --> 06:51.592
that can't call anyone--
it's that incredible.

06:51.626 --> 06:53.394
Now press the "submit" icon,

06:53.428 --> 06:56.130
and agree to buy
all our future products.

06:56.181 --> 06:59.583
And we're gonna be making
a lot of stuff.

07:00.585 --> 07:02.586
Submit. Submit.

07:02.621 --> 07:03.754
I don't know, I...

07:03.788 --> 07:05.756
Submit.
I don't want to.

07:05.774 --> 07:09.243
Or you could buy something
from Hewlett-Packard.

07:09.277 --> 07:10.611
I submit! I submit!

07:10.645 --> 07:12.613
Yes.

07:12.647 --> 07:14.048
Yes...

07:15.567 --> 07:17.100
(humming happily)

07:17.118 --> 07:19.470
Ooh, that adult Etch-A-Sketch

07:19.504 --> 07:21.288
certainly has
brightened your mood.

07:21.323 --> 07:22.840
Oh, yeah!

07:22.874 --> 07:24.391
You can look at it this way...

07:24.426 --> 07:25.626
or this way...

07:25.660 --> 07:26.794
whether you want to or not...

07:26.828 --> 07:30.397
and it's got awesome games
like "Tapped Out."

07:30.432 --> 07:31.665
Oh...

07:31.700 --> 07:33.934
"Virtual Stapler!"

07:33.969 --> 07:36.236
Sounds just like a stapler,
and it never runs out...

07:36.271 --> 07:37.638
unless you tell it to.

07:37.672 --> 07:40.991
Here's one that gives you
a cool '70s moustache.

07:41.026 --> 07:42.393
I'm Sonny Bono.

07:42.427 --> 07:44.028
Watch out for that tree!

07:44.062 --> 07:45.596
(giggles)

07:45.630 --> 07:47.031
So, which do you
prefer, m'lady?

07:47.065 --> 07:50.668
Tom Selleck, Rollie Fingers,
or Pringles Man?

07:50.702 --> 07:54.905
I always thought the Pringles
Man had the kindest eyes.

07:58.143 --> 08:00.844
Are you doing an app
behind my back?

08:00.879 --> 08:03.280
Submit... Submit... Sub...

08:05.717 --> 08:07.451
There ya go, Homer.

08:07.485 --> 08:08.986
Boy, you know,
when you're just here alone,

08:09.020 --> 08:10.521
I can really smell ya.

08:10.555 --> 08:11.722
But I'm not alone.

08:11.756 --> 08:13.574
I'm doing some FaceTime
with Lenny.

08:13.608 --> 08:15.509
It's like I'm skydiving
with all my friends!

08:15.543 --> 08:16.694
Let me text Carl.

08:16.728 --> 08:19.046
So, uh, what are you
pullin' the ripcord with?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.214
Uh-oh.

08:20.248 --> 08:21.815
Maybe there's a ripcord app
I can use.

08:23.551 --> 08:25.552
(Homer hums happily)

08:26.938 --> 08:29.023
MARGE:
Homer, pay attention!

08:29.057 --> 08:31.075
Huh? What?

08:31.643 --> 08:32.626
Put that down!

08:32.660 --> 08:34.010
We're being audited.

08:34.044 --> 08:36.530
The old stupid moustache'll
win him over.

08:36.563 --> 08:38.332
I'm really stupid.

08:38.366 --> 08:41.018
Is that the myPad you're
claiming as a business expense?

08:41.052 --> 08:42.503
I'm standing by that.

08:42.537 --> 08:43.537
(groans)

08:45.907 --> 08:46.957
Simpson!

08:50.378 --> 08:52.613
Unhand your Edison slate

08:52.647 --> 08:55.816
and bring your gold-brickery
to a caesura!

08:55.850 --> 08:59.653
Put down your myPad
and get back to work.

08:59.688 --> 09:00.921
Sorry, boss.

09:00.955 --> 09:03.257
Your remonstrances
are a welcome boon

09:03.291 --> 09:05.392
and surely will redouble
my diligence.

09:05.427 --> 09:07.594
Excellent!
Awesome!

09:07.629 --> 09:09.096
Woo hoo!
Pip-pip!

09:09.130 --> 09:10.197
Hmm...

09:12.033 --> 09:13.517
Hey, Dad!
Dad, check this out!

09:13.551 --> 09:16.220
Dad, over here!
Dad, a mother giraffe is giving birth!

09:16.254 --> 09:18.372
Dad, look, I'm walking on
the wall around the lion pit.

09:18.406 --> 09:20.708
Dad, the baby giraffe is
taking its first steps.

09:20.742 --> 09:22.009
Dad, I'm walking on my hands,

09:22.043 --> 09:23.243
and the lions think
they're gonna eat me!

09:23.278 --> 09:24.511
Will you kids pipe down?

09:24.546 --> 09:26.380
I'm trying to get
"Churro-Chaser" to tell me

09:26.414 --> 09:28.015
where the freshest churros are.

09:28.049 --> 09:29.683
What country is Mexico in?

09:29.718 --> 09:32.853
Dad, pay attention
to your children.

09:32.887 --> 09:34.521
Ugh, okay.

09:35.724 --> 09:36.690
Aww.

09:36.725 --> 09:38.192
That'll be my screensaver.

09:41.696 --> 09:43.464
(yells)
Just my arm.

09:43.498 --> 09:44.648
(yells)
(chuckles)

09:44.682 --> 09:45.649
Gotcha!

09:45.683 --> 09:47.701
Why, you little...
(screams)

09:47.736 --> 09:49.887
(screaming)

09:51.289 --> 09:53.290
(Tchaikovsky's <i>Pathétique</i> plays)

09:56.027 --> 09:59.396
Homie, you want to read to
Maggie before she goes to sleep?

10:00.832 --> 10:01.799
(scoffs)

10:01.833 --> 10:03.033
A paper-based read-a-majig?

10:03.068 --> 10:04.768
What are we, cavemen?

10:04.803 --> 10:05.886
(imitates caveman grunting)

10:11.459 --> 10:13.977
Sweetie, in the future
all you'll need is this.

10:14.012 --> 10:15.512
Homie... it looks
like you're putting

10:15.547 --> 10:17.648
all your eggs in one basket.

10:17.682 --> 10:18.882
What would you have me do?

10:18.917 --> 10:20.217
One basket for each egg?

10:20.251 --> 10:21.835
Hmm, I guess you're right.

10:21.886 --> 10:23.771
I guess I'll have
to scratch that off

10:23.805 --> 10:25.205
the list of things I say.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.558
Now, Maggie, let's find
a good game for us.

10:27.592 --> 10:30.160
Hmm, "Krusty's Kosher
Karnival..."

10:30.195 --> 10:31.762
"Words with Enemies..."

10:31.796 --> 10:33.063
"Don't Burn the Toast,"

10:33.098 --> 10:34.465
"Lenny Dykstra's
Prison Break..."

10:34.499 --> 10:36.133
ooh, "Pizza Clock!"

10:36.167 --> 10:38.669
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

10:38.703 --> 10:40.270
Dough, sauce,
cheese, topping.

10:40.305 --> 10:41.839
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

10:41.873 --> 10:43.373
Having fun, Maggie?

10:43.408 --> 10:45.459
How long have I been playing?

10:45.493 --> 10:47.928
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

10:47.962 --> 10:49.797
So that's how
you make a pizza?

10:49.831 --> 10:51.832
Ooh, we really have
been off-a the mark.

10:52.851 --> 10:54.318
Mmm...

10:54.352 --> 10:57.121
(raspy): Dough, sauce,
cheese, topping.

10:57.155 --> 11:00.874
Dough, sauce, cheese, topping.

11:00.909 --> 11:02.442
D'oh!

11:02.477 --> 11:03.994
(thud)
Sauce, cheese, topping.

11:04.028 --> 11:05.496
(groans)

11:05.530 --> 11:08.782
Flushy, go get help.

11:10.780 --> 11:14.916
Homer, you're gonna be fine, but
there's no hope for the myPad.

11:14.951 --> 11:19.321
(sobbing):
It still had 88% of its charge.

11:19.355 --> 11:21.356
This is the part
of the job I hate most.

11:21.390 --> 11:23.758
Talking to crazy people.

11:23.793 --> 11:25.260
(laughs)

11:25.294 --> 11:27.262
(groans)

11:27.296 --> 11:29.381
(grunting)

11:29.415 --> 11:30.849
Which of you is the YouTube

11:30.883 --> 11:33.051
of the kid high
on dentist's gas?

11:33.085 --> 11:34.486
Is it you?

11:34.520 --> 11:37.155
Is it... you?
Is it you?

11:37.189 --> 11:40.175
(moaning)

11:40.209 --> 11:43.311
Oh, Lord, when things looked
darkest, you gave me light,

11:43.346 --> 11:45.213
then you switched it off,
knowing full well

11:45.248 --> 11:47.782
I had declined
thy infernal Mapple Care.

11:47.817 --> 11:50.318
Please grant me the wisdom
to understand

11:50.353 --> 11:52.537
your capricious nasty mind.

11:52.555 --> 11:56.291
And please, please make the next
swing of the yo-yo an up.

11:56.325 --> 11:57.459
Amen.

11:57.493 --> 11:58.994
ALL:
Amen.

12:03.916 --> 12:05.817
(sighs)

12:05.851 --> 12:07.218
Everybody hear that?

12:07.253 --> 12:08.720
Homer, Homer,
it's a miracle.

12:08.754 --> 12:11.089
Keep your pants on,
Flanders.

12:11.123 --> 12:12.407
(laughs):
Oh, I will.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.175
Till I go to bed and take
them off under the covers.

12:14.210 --> 12:16.077
But come outside
and see the miracle.

12:16.112 --> 12:17.679
Has the myPad risen?

12:17.713 --> 12:19.514
No, it's still
where you buried it.

12:19.548 --> 12:21.733
(Flanders humming)

12:21.767 --> 12:24.369
Here it is, the Holy Ooze.

12:24.403 --> 12:26.404
This is your miracle--
a tree?

12:26.439 --> 12:30.342
Ooh, look at me, I turn sunlight
into complex sugars.

12:30.376 --> 12:31.610
Big whoop.

12:31.644 --> 12:32.844
Look a little closer.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.713
Huh? "Hope."

12:34.747 --> 12:36.548
Is this one
of those coincidences

12:36.582 --> 12:37.682
like Jesus on a tortilla,

12:37.717 --> 12:40.101
or George Washington
on a dollar bill?

12:40.136 --> 12:43.755
Well, I like that its message
is in sap and not in blood.

12:43.789 --> 12:45.590
Like some miracles
I could mention.

12:45.625 --> 12:47.025
(clears throat):
Passover.

12:47.059 --> 12:50.562
Well, this is how God would send
me a message: in my backyard,

12:50.596 --> 12:53.565
hammock-adjacent,
one short word in large print.

12:53.599 --> 12:55.934
What do you think he's trying
to tell me, Flanders?

12:55.968 --> 12:57.535
Well, sir, if you ask me,

12:57.570 --> 12:58.936
somebody up there
is trying to tell you

12:58.954 --> 13:01.623
that whatever flat tires
you've got in your life,

13:01.657 --> 13:03.742
God's there
with his little spare

13:03.776 --> 13:05.543
and it enables you
to drive real slow

13:05.578 --> 13:06.944
till you get
to the next station.

13:06.962 --> 13:08.963
Don't eat the miracle.

13:08.998 --> 13:11.516
Fine, I'll just go eat
the body of God.

13:11.550 --> 13:13.551
<i>That's</i> not crazy.

13:16.622 --> 13:18.006
Ah, looks like you're really

13:18.040 --> 13:20.442
turning something over
in your mind there, Homer.

13:20.476 --> 13:22.844
Moe, I could believe
this was a random occurrence

13:22.878 --> 13:25.096
or I could believe some
higher power reached down

13:25.131 --> 13:27.699
and squeezed the sap
out of that tree.

13:27.733 --> 13:29.434
I'm choosing hope.

13:29.468 --> 13:31.736
Moe, a bottle
of your finest beer.

13:31.771 --> 13:32.721
Here you go.

13:32.755 --> 13:33.855
Duff Adequate.

13:33.889 --> 13:35.907
To hope!

13:35.941 --> 13:38.610
Wow, no one's ever been happy
in this place before.

13:38.644 --> 13:42.013
And when I started it was Moe's
Ice Cream Carnival-- not good.

13:42.048 --> 13:43.748
(organ playing)

13:43.783 --> 13:46.351
Of all the gifts
the Lord gives us,

13:46.385 --> 13:49.421
perhaps the greatest is hope.

13:49.455 --> 13:53.058
Uh, excuse me, Reverend,
but I'm here to talk

13:53.092 --> 13:56.795
about something a little
more important: hope.

13:56.829 --> 13:58.196
But I was just... (sighs)

13:58.230 --> 14:01.266
Oh, fine-- I can get an early
start on mountain biking.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.318
Hope is here, people,
and it's real.

14:03.352 --> 14:06.104
It's not just
inside the house of God,

14:06.138 --> 14:09.607
it's outside the house of me.

14:09.642 --> 14:12.043
So come and see
the sticky brown truth.

14:12.078 --> 14:14.612
(all cheering)

14:14.647 --> 14:16.848
♪ Ooh-ooh, child

14:16.866 --> 14:20.068
♪ Things are gonna be easier

14:20.119 --> 14:24.622
Hope is all around me!
♪ Ooh, child, things'll be brighter ♪

14:24.657 --> 14:27.892
(grunting)
♪ Ooh-ooh, child...

14:27.927 --> 14:31.346
Hmm. As promised, the miracle.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.001
Really? "Other"?

14:37.036 --> 14:38.937
Cletus, what does
that tree say?

14:38.971 --> 14:40.422
Now, now,
let's spell it out

14:40.456 --> 14:43.224
like that social worker
taught us to do.

14:43.259 --> 14:46.060
Huckleberry, Overbite,
Picklefoot,

14:46.095 --> 14:47.328
Edumacation.

14:47.363 --> 14:49.230
Oh, it says hope!

14:49.265 --> 14:52.901
Just like in <i>Hope Floats,</i> that
Sandra Bullock movie I wrote.

14:56.071 --> 14:58.056
This is newsman Kent Brockman,

14:58.090 --> 15:01.059
vowing I will debunk
this so-called miracle.

15:01.093 --> 15:03.862
The idiotic things
people believe in.

15:03.896 --> 15:05.964
Now, stay tuned
for your lucky lotto numbers.

15:05.998 --> 15:08.600
It's your turn for sure.

15:10.865 --> 15:12.866
(crowd clamoring)

15:14.902 --> 15:17.737
A hundred dollar bill
for anyone who will give me

15:17.772 --> 15:21.074
the truth behind this
so-called miracle tree.

15:21.108 --> 15:24.210
I'll take your money.
The tree's a fraud.

15:24.245 --> 15:27.313
I just got a hundred.
The tree is real!

15:27.348 --> 15:29.015
What you got
against hope anyway?

15:29.050 --> 15:32.452
I bet something
disillusioned you as a child.

15:32.486 --> 15:33.820
(gasps)

15:38.292 --> 15:40.860
This is junior reporter
Kenny Bockelstein,

15:40.895 --> 15:43.830
investigating the stories
that kids want to know.

15:43.864 --> 15:45.231
(locker opens)

15:46.600 --> 15:48.334
Mr. Mouse, how come
you haven't been

15:48.369 --> 15:51.371
in any funny cartoons
since 1933?

15:54.842 --> 15:56.893
I'm on a break, kid,
and when I'm on a break,

15:56.927 --> 15:57.894
the mouse is dead.

15:59.747 --> 16:01.981
The mouse was a man.
His teeth were yellow.

16:02.016 --> 16:03.216
His breath was rancid.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.385
My innocence was lost
in a plywood castle.

16:05.419 --> 16:07.320
The castle is plywood?!

16:07.354 --> 16:09.556
(groans)

16:09.590 --> 16:10.990
TV ANNOUNCER:
<i>Bumblebee Man is moving</i>

16:11.025 --> 16:12.892
to Channel 6.

16:12.927 --> 16:14.060
<i>Adios, ocho.</i>

16:14.095 --> 16:15.662
You no pay.

16:15.696 --> 16:17.597
Uh-oh, he's got
his own chimp.

16:17.631 --> 16:18.865
(chimp yelling)

16:18.899 --> 16:20.066
Senor Chango!

16:20.101 --> 16:21.918
Teeny's a girl?

16:21.936 --> 16:24.237
Oh, wait, he's just a bottom.

16:25.206 --> 16:26.706
This is Kent Brockman
at the site

16:26.741 --> 16:29.008
of the so-called
"Springfield Miracle."

16:30.111 --> 16:31.411
The question is...

16:31.445 --> 16:33.012
Is the hope tree a miracle?

16:33.047 --> 16:34.514
Most decidedly not.

16:34.548 --> 16:36.099
<i>Flying the Channel 6</i>
<i>traffic copter</i>

16:36.117 --> 16:38.267
<i>without official clearance</i>
<i>and below legal levels,</i>

16:38.285 --> 16:39.769
<i>we obtained</i>
<i>the following footage.</i>

16:39.787 --> 16:42.956
<i>As you can see here,</i>
<i>a shadowy figure emerges</i>

16:42.990 --> 16:44.808
<i>from the darkness,</i>
<i>walks up to the tree</i>

16:44.842 --> 16:46.342
<i>in the Simpsons' backyard,</i>

16:46.377 --> 16:48.411
<i>and if we freeze</i>
<i>and zoom in on the image,</i>

16:48.445 --> 16:51.514
We clearly see the figure
holding a syrup bottle

16:51.549 --> 16:53.833
with which he writes
the word "hope."

16:55.636 --> 16:57.570
Supermarket maple syrup.

16:57.605 --> 16:59.506
It was no miraculous tree of God

16:59.557 --> 17:02.125
and there is no hope
on Evergreen Terrace.

17:02.159 --> 17:05.561
Just a run-of-the-mill,
syrup-spraying mystery man.

17:05.596 --> 17:08.298
We can add this
to the list of...

17:08.332 --> 17:11.634
Kent's Closed Cases.

17:11.669 --> 17:14.002
Would you please
get the segment straight?

17:14.038 --> 17:15.538
Just lose the graphic.

17:15.573 --> 17:16.638
(groans)

17:16.674 --> 17:17.906
(groaning)

17:17.942 --> 17:19.175
It was all a hoax.

17:19.210 --> 17:21.644
Let's burn our hats!

17:21.679 --> 17:23.946
ALL (chanting):
Hope is dead! Burn the lies!

17:23.981 --> 17:25.949
Thank God there's no alcohol
in this bar,

17:25.983 --> 17:27.517
or this place
would really go up.

17:27.550 --> 17:29.252
(groans)

17:29.286 --> 17:31.121
(groaning)
Homie?

17:31.155 --> 17:32.839
Aren't you going
to come in?

17:32.873 --> 17:34.707
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

17:34.742 --> 17:36.776
Maybe it's time to call Satan.

17:36.811 --> 17:37.944
Is that a 212?

17:37.978 --> 17:39.579
Don't call Satan.

17:39.613 --> 17:42.749
So what if the message
wasn't the miracle.

17:42.783 --> 17:47.287
The answer isn't in syrup
from God or a computer tablet.

17:47.321 --> 17:51.024
The answer is that you hope
you felt was real.

17:51.058 --> 17:52.358
Marge, up till now,

17:52.393 --> 17:54.861
I thought your hair
was just blue cotton candy,

17:54.895 --> 17:58.665
but now I know
it's a solid loaf of brain.

17:58.699 --> 18:01.601
Homie, you have such
a way with foods.

18:01.635 --> 18:03.436
Let's go inside.

18:03.470 --> 18:05.672
Who do you think painted
the word on the tree?

18:05.706 --> 18:09.175
No idea-- the important
thing is that they did.

18:09.210 --> 18:10.510
Guess it must've
been the person
