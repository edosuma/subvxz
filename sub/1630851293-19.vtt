00:36.500 --> 00:38.500
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL ONLY

00:38.566 --> 00:40.566
TAKING PLACE HERE FOR FOUR MORE

00:40.633 --> 00:41.666
SHOWS.

00:41.733 --> 00:43.233
>> CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.800
>> John: I THINK I LIKED IT

00:44.866 --> 00:47.900
BETTER WHEN YOU WERE SILENT.

00:47.966 --> 00:51.500
>> YOU KNOW WHAT WASN'T SILENT?

00:51.566 --> 00:56.100
WHEN YOU FUCKING BLEW ME UP.

00:56.166 --> 00:56.866
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

00:56.933 --> 00:58.033
>> John: I DO.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.500
BARCODING KIRK SCARED EVERYONE,

01:00.566 --> 01:05.066
AND THE HOUSE BEGAN THE

01:05.133 --> 01:07.433
INVESTIGATION OF THE IN SPIRIT

01:07.500 --> 01:08.733
INSURRECTION.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.366
BUT WHEN JIM JORDAN STRUGGLED TO

01:11.433 --> 01:13.233
ANSWER A BASIC QUESTION.

01:13.300 --> 01:13.866
>> YES OR NO, DID YOU SPEAK TO

01:13.933 --> 01:14.866
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON JANUARY

01:14.933 --> 01:15.200
SIXTH?

01:15.266 --> 01:15.966
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I SPEAK -- I

01:16.033 --> 01:16.566
SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT LAST

01:16.633 --> 01:17.666
WEEK.

01:17.733 --> 01:18.533
I SPEAK WITH THE PRESIDENT ALL

01:18.600 --> 01:19.100
THE TIME, I SPOKE WITH THE

01:19.166 --> 01:19.633
PRESIDENT ON JANUARY 6TH.

01:19.700 --> 01:20.233
I MEAN, I TALK WITH PRESIDENT

01:20.300 --> 01:21.166
TRUMP ALL THE TIME.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.366
>> ON JANUARY 6, DID YOU SPEAK

01:23.433 --> 01:26.433
WITH HIM BEFORE, DURING, OR

01:26.500 --> 01:30.400
AFTER THE CAPITOL WAS ATTACKED?

01:30.466 --> 01:33.200
>> UH, I'D HAVE TO GO -- I

01:33.266 --> 01:34.166
-- I SPOKE WITH HIM THAT

01:34.233 --> 01:34.933
DAY AFTER?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.166
I THINK AFTER?

01:36.233 --> 01:36.900
I DON'T KNOW IF I SPOKE WITH HIM

01:36.966 --> 01:37.400
IN THE MORNING OR NOT.

01:37.466 --> 01:38.166
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.433
I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND -- I

01:39.500 --> 01:40.200
MEAN, I DON'T, I DON'T, I DON'T

01:40.266 --> 01:42.100
KNOW WHEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:42.166 --> 01:43.766
HAPPENED, BUT WHAT I KNOW IS, I

01:43.833 --> 01:46.800
SPOKE WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.

01:46.866 --> 01:47.566
>> John: OH, OKAY THEN!

01:47.633 --> 01:48.266
THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE!

01:48.333 --> 01:49.266
YOU SEEM TO BE EMPLOYING BOTH

01:49.333 --> 01:50.000
THE NERVOUS ENERGY AND DEEPLY

01:50.066 --> 01:50.800
SUSPICIOUS DENIALS NORMALLY

01:50.866 --> 01:58.866
RESERVED FOR WOODY ALLEN.

01:58.933 --> 01:59.800
WHY WOULDN'T I FIND THAT

01:59.866 --> 02:00.733
REASSURING?

02:00.800 --> 02:01.600
BUT INSTEAD OF THAT, I'D LIKE TO

02:01.666 --> 02:02.433
BRIEFLY FOCUS ON AFGHANISTAN.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.100
THE U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM THERE

02:03.166 --> 02:03.833
IS NEARLY COMPLETE, AHEAD OF THE

02:03.900 --> 02:04.600
AUGUST 31 DEADLINE SET BY THE

02:04.666 --> 02:05.600
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION.

02:05.666 --> 02:06.666
BUT MANY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:06.733 --> 02:08.200
WHO'S BEING LEFT BEHIND.

02:08.266 --> 02:10.066
>> AS AMERICA ENDS ITS LONGEST

02:10.133 --> 02:11.200
WAR, THE TRANSLATORS LEFT BEHIND

02:11.266 --> 02:12.566
ARE BEGGING THE BIDEN

02:12.633 --> 02:14.366
ADMINISTRATION TO CUT THROUGH

02:14.433 --> 02:16.100
THE RED TAPE AND GRANT THEM

02:16.166 --> 02:20.600
SPECIAL VISAS TO COME TO THE

02:20.666 --> 02:21.700
U.S.

02:21.766 --> 02:22.833
TODAY, INDEPENDENT SENATOR

02:22.900 --> 02:23.433
ANGUS KING TOLD REPORTERS THE

02:23.500 --> 02:24.200
PRESIDENT'S HAIR SHOULD BE ON

02:24.266 --> 02:25.300
FIRE OVER THIS SITUATION.

02:25.366 --> 02:26.600
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

02:26.666 --> 02:27.866
THIS IS A SITUATION BIDEN'S HAIR

02:27.933 --> 02:28.800
SHOULD BE ON FIRE ABOUT -- BOTH

02:28.866 --> 02:29.566
METAPHORICALLY AND LITERALLY.

02:29.633 --> 02:30.933
IT'D FRANKLY BE A HUGE

02:31.000 --> 02:32.933
IMPROVEMENT ON HIS CURRENT LOOK,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
WHICH I'D DESCRIBE AS

02:37.066 --> 02:41.100
"BUSINESS GHOST," ALSO KNOWN AS

02:41.166 --> 02:43.000
THE "SANE DOC BROWN" OR

02:43.066 --> 02:43.566
"THE FLAT JAMIE LEE CURTIS."

02:43.633 --> 02:44.200
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, THERE ARE

02:44.266 --> 02:44.833
THOUSANDS OF AFGHANS WHO HELPED

02:44.900 --> 02:45.433
U.S. TROOPS DURING THE WAR WHO

02:45.500 --> 02:46.400
BADLY NEED TO BE EVACUATED

02:46.466 --> 02:47.133
BECAUSE THE TALIBAN VERY MUCH

02:47.200 --> 02:48.166
WANTS TO KILL THEM.

02:48.233 --> 02:50.233
SINCE 2014, MORE THAN 300

02:50.300 --> 02:51.366
TRANSLATORS OR THEIR FAMILY

02:51.433 --> 02:53.100
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN KILLED.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.833
AND I WILL SAY, PUBLICLY, BIDEN

02:54.900 --> 02:56.466
HAS BEEN SENDING ENCOURAGING

02:56.533 --> 03:00.066
MESSAGES.

03:00.133 --> 03:01.133
>> OUR MESSAGE TO THOSE WOMEN

03:01.200 --> 03:03.266
AND MEN IS CLEAR.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.766
THERE IS A HOME FOR YOU IN THE

03:04.833 --> 03:06.433
UNITED STATES IF YOU SO CHOOSE,

03:06.500 --> 03:08.300
AND WE WILL STAND WITH YOU JUST

03:08.366 --> 03:13.400
AS YOU STOOD WITH US.

03:13.466 --> 03:14.133
>> John: OH, WELL, THAT SOUNDS

03:14.200 --> 03:14.700
GREAT!

03:14.766 --> 03:18.533
ALTHOUGH THAT "IF THEY SO CHOOSE

03:18.600 --> 03:19.633
PART" IS DOING A LOT OF WORK.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.400
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SO MUCH THEIR

03:20.466 --> 03:21.000
CHOICE AS OURS.

03:21.066 --> 03:21.733
WE'RE THE ONES IN CHARGE OF THE

03:21.800 --> 03:23.433
PROCESS, SO PUTTING THE CHOICE

03:23.500 --> 03:25.200
ON THE APPLICANTS IS BASICALLY A

03:25.266 --> 03:26.800
SURGEON HANDING YOU A SCALPEL,

03:26.866 --> 03:28.100
SAYING, "THERE IS A TUMOR-FREE

03:28.166 --> 03:29.333
PANCREAS IN YOUR BODY IF YOU SO

03:29.400 --> 03:31.333
CHOOSE, AND I WILL STAND WITH

03:31.400 --> 03:32.466
YOU."

03:32.533 --> 03:34.300
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE

03:34.366 --> 03:35.166
FUNDAMENTALLY CONFUSED ABOUT WHO

03:35.233 --> 03:37.433
HAS POWER OVER THE OUTCOME HERE.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.566
AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS HAS

03:38.633 --> 03:40.433
BEEN A MESS FOR A LONG TIME.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.333
AS WE DISCUSSED ON THE FIRST

03:42.400 --> 03:44.900
SEASON OF THIS SHOW --

03:44.966 --> 03:46.866
PRESUMABLY 40 YEARS AGO -- JUST

03:46.933 --> 03:48.266
APPLYING FOR A SPECIAL IMMIGRANT

03:48.333 --> 03:50.300
VISA CAN BE A NIGHTMARE.

03:50.366 --> 03:52.100
AND WHILE 18,000 AFGHANS HAVE

03:52.166 --> 03:53.733
APPLIED ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES

03:53.800 --> 03:56.766
AND THEIR FAMILIES --

03:56.833 --> 03:57.533
REPRESENTING AN ESTIMATED 53,000

03:57.600 --> 04:00.033
PEOPLE IN TOTAL -- MANY HAVE

04:00.100 --> 04:01.466
BEEN STUCK WAITING, IN SOME

04:01.533 --> 04:03.066
CASES FOR YEARS.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.600
>> MONEER NOORI HAS BEEN WAITING

04:05.666 --> 04:06.633
ON A SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA FOR

04:06.700 --> 04:08.600
NEARLY A DECADE.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.833
HE FIRST APPLIED FOR A

04:10.900 --> 04:12.366
SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA IN 2013

04:12.433 --> 04:13.266
AND SAID HE'S BEEN REJECTED FOUR

04:13.333 --> 04:14.033
TIMES.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.300
MONEER WAS TOLD BY THE STATE

04:15.366 --> 04:15.966
DEPARTMENT THAT HIS DOCUMENTS

04:16.033 --> 04:16.733
WERE FRAUDULENT BUT WAS NOT

04:16.800 --> 04:17.633
GIVEN ANY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE TO

04:17.700 --> 04:19.366
APPEAL.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.333
>> THERE IS MORE THAN HUNDREDS

04:20.400 --> 04:22.000
AND HUNDREDS MORE SPECIAL FORCE

04:22.066 --> 04:25.466
INTERPRETERS LEFT BEHIND.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.100
THEY HAVE THE SAME ISSUES.

04:28.166 --> 04:29.066
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT

04:29.133 --> 04:30.800
BEHIND.

04:30.866 --> 04:33.433
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE NOT.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.866
AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.133
BECAUSE IT'S PRACTICALLY A

04:37.200 --> 04:38.466
DEATH SENTENCE.

04:38.533 --> 04:39.733
BEING LEFT BEHIND, IN THIS

04:39.800 --> 04:41.233
CONTEXT IS EVEN WORSE THAN

04:41.300 --> 04:42.600
SEEING "LEFT BEHIND," THE 2014

04:42.666 --> 04:44.166
NICOLAS CAGE FAITH-BASED

04:44.233 --> 04:45.766
THRILLER ABOUT THE SECOND COMING

04:45.833 --> 04:49.100
THAT BOASTS -- AND THIS IS

04:49.166 --> 04:51.833
TRUE -- A SOLID 1%

04:51.900 --> 04:52.266
ON ROTTEN TOMATOES.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.966
CLEARLY, THERE AREN'T MANY

04:54.033 --> 04:55.600
THINGS WORSE THAN SEEING

04:55.666 --> 04:56.666
"LEFT BEHIND," BUT I'M GOING TO

04:56.733 --> 04:57.900
SAY GETTING ABANDONED TO BE

04:57.966 --> 04:59.100
MURDERED BY THE TALIBAN IS

04:59.166 --> 04:59.600
DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM.

04:59.666 --> 05:00.500
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT

05:00.566 --> 05:02.200
INTERPRETER WHO'S FRUSTRATED --

05:02.266 --> 05:03.666
THE U.S. SOLDIERS HE WORKED

05:03.733 --> 05:05.133
ALONGSIDE ARE ALSO APPALLED BY

05:05.200 --> 05:08.000
THE SITUATION.

05:08.066 --> 05:08.800
>> WE'RE FILLING OUT ALL THE

05:08.866 --> 05:09.333
PAPERWORK.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.166
WE'RE GOING THROUGH ALL THE DUE

05:10.233 --> 05:10.900
DILIGENCE AND THE PROCESS TO

05:10.966 --> 05:12.133
MAKE THIS RIGHT.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.566
AND NOBODY IS RESPONDING WITH

05:13.633 --> 05:14.866
ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE

05:14.933 --> 05:19.266
CRITICAL TO GETTING HIM OUT OF

05:19.333 --> 05:19.900
COUNTRY.

05:19.966 --> 05:20.800
>> LIKE, THIS IS, LIKE,

05:20.866 --> 05:21.400
BOTH A HUGE LEADERSHIP FAILURE

05:21.466 --> 05:22.533
FOR ME, LIKE, PERSONALLY, AND

05:22.600 --> 05:23.066
THE MILITARY.

05:23.133 --> 05:24.066
THE -- THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T

05:24.133 --> 05:24.800
BEEN ABLE TO GET MY -- MY GUY

05:24.866 --> 05:26.433
OUT.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.300
>> John: THAT DOES SOUND

05:29.366 --> 05:30.233
MADDENING.

05:30.300 --> 05:31.166
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE "GETTING MY

05:31.233 --> 05:33.600
GUY OUT" IS BASICALLY WHAT WE'VE

05:33.666 --> 05:34.400
BEEN CONDITIONED TO THINK THE

05:34.466 --> 05:35.400
MILITARY DOES.

05:35.466 --> 05:36.500
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE "SAVING

05:36.566 --> 05:37.900
PRIVATE RYAN," NOT "FILING

05:37.966 --> 05:39.300
PAPERWORK ON PRIVATE RYAN'S

05:39.366 --> 05:41.000
BEHALF, WAITING A FEW MONTHS,

05:41.066 --> 05:42.500
FILING REQUISITION PAPERWORK TO

05:42.566 --> 05:43.433
TRACK DOWN THE INITIAL

05:43.500 --> 05:44.333
PAPERWORK, AND THEN LEARNING

05:44.400 --> 05:45.833
PRIVATE RYAN WAS SHOT IN THE

05:45.900 --> 05:48.066
HEAD BY A NAZI LAST MONTH."

05:48.133 --> 05:50.266
AND THERE IS REAL URGENCY HERE,

05:50.333 --> 05:51.433
AS THE TALIBAN CURRENTLY

05:51.500 --> 05:52.100
CONTROLS ABOUT HALF OF

05:52.166 --> 05:53.700
AFGHANISTAN'S 419 DISTRICT

05:53.766 --> 05:55.233
CENTERS, AND WHILE THEY'VE YET

05:55.300 --> 05:56.033
TO CAPTURE ANY OF THE PROVINCIAL

05:56.100 --> 05:57.233
CAPITALS, THEY ARE PRESSURING

05:57.300 --> 05:59.333
ABOUT HALF OF THEM.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.366
THIS IS BASICALLY THE BILL COSBY

06:01.433 --> 06:02.433
COMEBACK TOUR OF POLITICAL

06:02.500 --> 06:04.300
CRISES: WE CAN ALL SEE WHERE

06:04.366 --> 06:05.633
IT'S GOING, AND IF WE DON'T ACT

06:05.700 --> 06:07.366
QUICKLY, SOMETHING TERRIBLE IS

06:07.433 --> 06:09.866
GOING TO HAPPEN.

06:09.933 --> 06:11.766
AND INCREDIBLY, THERE ARE

06:11.833 --> 06:16.866
SOME -- LIKE SUPERCUTS SUPERFAN

06:16.933 --> 06:17.966
RAND PAUL -- WHO HAVE QUESTIONED

06:18.033 --> 06:19.200
WHETHER WE SHOULD BE EVACUATING

06:19.266 --> 06:19.733
ALL THESE PEOPLE AT ALL.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.366
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM RATHER

06:20.433 --> 06:22.666
TO STAY AND FIGHT.

06:22.733 --> 06:24.666
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE

06:24.733 --> 06:25.566
MANY ENGLISH SPEAKERS IN

06:25.633 --> 06:26.433
AFGHANISTAN.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.500
THE FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN COULD

06:27.566 --> 06:29.000
BE A BRIGHT FUTURE, BUT THEY'RE

06:29.066 --> 06:30.700
GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT

06:30.766 --> 06:31.833
AND, ULTIMATELY, IT IS THEIR

06:31.900 --> 06:32.333
FIGHT.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.266
>> John: OKAY, FIRST -- FUCK ALL

06:33.333 --> 06:36.133
THE WAY OFF.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.100
AND SECOND -- FIGHT WITH FUCKING

06:37.166 --> 06:37.800
WHAT, EXACTLY?

06:37.866 --> 06:38.733
THEIR WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE

06:38.800 --> 06:40.166
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THERE, THEIR

06:40.233 --> 06:40.800
AND THEY'RE?

06:40.866 --> 06:42.033
ALSO, TELLING TRANSLATORS TO

06:42.100 --> 06:44.066
"STAY AND FIGHT THE TALIBAN" IS

06:44.133 --> 06:45.500
PRETTY RICH COMING FROM A GUY

06:45.566 --> 06:46.600
WHO COULDN'T EVEN WIN A FIGHT

06:46.666 --> 06:48.033
AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR ON HIS OWN

06:48.100 --> 06:50.033
FRONT LAWN.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.600
AND THE ADMINISTRATION MAY POINT

06:51.666 --> 06:53.933
TO THE FACT THAT, THIS MONTH,

06:54.000 --> 06:54.566
2500 AFGHANS ARE BEING FLOWN IN

06:54.633 --> 06:55.100
STAGES TO AN ARMY BASE IN

06:55.166 --> 06:56.300
VIRGINIA.

06:56.366 --> 06:58.000
AND THAT THEY'RE NEGOTIATING

06:58.066 --> 06:59.066
WITH THIRD COUNTRIES LIKE QATAR

06:59.133 --> 07:00.133
AND KUWAIT TO HOUSE AFGHANS AT

MILITARY BASES WHILE THEY AWAIT

07:01.666 --> 07:03.733
VISA APPROVAL.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.166

07:05.233 --> 07:06.733
THE PEOPLEIN THE PIPELINE HAVE

07:06.800 --> 07:08.833
BEEN EVACUATED.

07:08.900 --> 07:09.766
AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE JUST

07:09.833 --> 07:15.066
SCRAMBLING FOR A PLAN NOW IS

07:15.133 --> 07:17.100
INEXCUSABLE WHEN WE'VE HAD 20

07:17.166 --> 07:18.266
YEARS TO DEVELOP ONE, AND FOR

07:18.333 --> 07:19.433
AROUND HALF THAT TIME, BIDEN WAS

07:19.500 --> 07:20.533
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.766

07:21.833 --> 07:26.266
THESE APPLICANTS ARE SAFE, WE

07:26.333 --> 07:27.933
COULD BRING THEM TO THE U.S. FOR

07:28.000 --> 07:28.233
PROCESSING.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.433
GUAM HAS BEEN SUGGESTED.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.666
AND WE SHOULD DO THAT RIGHT NOW

07:30.733 --> 07:32.133
BECAUSE THE CLOCK IS TICKING,

07:32.200 --> 07:33.066
AND THE TRANSLATORS IN

07:33.133 --> 07:33.700
AFGHANISTAN ARE WELL AWARE OF

07:33.766 --> 07:35.200
THAT FACT.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.633
>> PHONE CALLS?

07:45.700 --> 07:47.866
>> YES.

07:47.933 --> 07:49.600
AND THEY TOLD ME, "SOON WE WILL

07:49.666 --> 07:50.600
COME TO KABUL, AND WE WILL FIND

07:50.666 --> 07:52.366
YOU AND WE WILL KILL YOU."

07:52.433 --> 07:54.766
>> THE TALIBAN HAVE SAID

07:54.833 --> 07:56.566
INTERPRETERS WILL NOT BE IN

07:56.633 --> 07:58.000
DANGER, AS LONG AS THEY SHOW

07:58.066 --> 07:59.000
REMORSE FOR THEIR TREASON.

08:01.766 --> 08:03.500

08:07.066 --> 08:09.133
DOESN'T BELIEVE THE TALIBAN.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.966
A "TALIBAN PROMISE" SOUNDS

08:11.033 --> 08:12.166
INHERENTLY LIKE BULLSHIT.

08:12.233 --> 08:13.400
IT ALSO SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY

RACIST SOFT-CORE ROMANCE

08:14.300 --> 08:14.966
PAPERBACK WRITTEN BY A WHITE

WOMAN WHO'S NEVER MET ANYONE

08:16.000 --> 08:16.933
FROM THERE.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.266
BUT MOSTLY IT SOUNDS LIKE

08:18.333 --> 08:19.200
BULLSHIT.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.666
THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE

08:20.733 --> 08:22.433
THINGS WILL END WELL FOR ANYONE

08:22.500 --> 08:24.166
WE LEAVE BEHIND.

08:24.233 --> 08:26.200

RISK TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR

08:27.600 --> 08:28.833
FAMILIES.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.600
AND IF YOU DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

08:31.666 --> 08:33.400
GIVE THEM A SAFE HOME HERE IN

08:33.466 --> 08:39.666
RETURN, THEN ALL I HAVE TO SAY

08:39.733 --> 08:41.200
IS THIS:

08:41.266 --> 08:42.033
ACTUALLY, CAN I GET A TRANSLATOR

08:42.100 --> 08:43.200
FOR THAT?

08:43.266 --> 08:44.533
>> HE SAID, "FUCK YOU."

08:44.600 --> 08:45.000

12:42.733 --> 12:44.233
THINK ABOUT IT LIKE THIS: IF YOU

EVERYTHING THAT THE SITUATION

DEMANDED.

12:56.533 --> 12:57.200

13:00.666 --> 13:02.366

13:06.966 --> 13:08.233

14:02.366 --> 14:03.966
AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO FIX

14:04.033 --> 14:05.933
THINGS.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.733
AND THE FIRST THING TO KNOW IS,

14:07.800 --> 14:09.100
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

14:09.166 --> 14:10.600
CONSISTENCY WHEN IT COMES TO EMS

14:10.666 --> 14:11.966
IN THIS COUNTRY.

14:12.033 --> 14:13.400
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT "EMERGENCY

14:13.466 --> 14:14.766
MEDICAL SERVICES," YOU'RE

14:14.833 --> 14:17.200
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT 19,000

14:17.266 --> 14:18.266
LOCALLY RUN EMS PROVIDERS WITH

14:18.333 --> 14:21.100
WILDLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES.

14:21.166 --> 14:22.766
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF JUST HOW

14:22.833 --> 14:24.500
MUCH VARIANCE EXISTS: IN

14:24.566 --> 14:25.700
HOUSTON, EMS IS PROVIDED BY

14:25.766 --> 14:27.200
FIREFIGHTERS CROSS-TRAINED AS

14:27.266 --> 14:29.033
PARAMEDICS OR EMTs.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.433
IN NEW YORK CITY, IT'S UNDER THE

14:31.500 --> 14:32.133
FIRE DEPARTMENT UMBRELLA, BUT

14:32.200 --> 14:33.500
IT'S A SEPARATE DIVISION AND

14:33.566 --> 14:35.166
SUPPLEMENTED BY PRIVATE

14:35.233 --> 14:36.600
COMPANIES.

14:36.666 --> 14:37.533
IN PITTSBURGH, IT'S A

14:37.600 --> 14:38.500
FREE-STANDING MUNICIPAL

14:38.566 --> 14:39.833
DEPARTMENT OF ITS OWN.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.033
AND IN RURAL WYOMING, EMS IS

14:41.100 --> 14:41.800
MOSTLY PROVIDED BY

14:41.866 --> 14:44.033
VOLUNTEER-BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.433
AND FRUSTRATINGLY, IN NO PARTS

14:46.500 --> 14:51.300
OF THE COUNTRY DOES EMS HAVE

14:51.366 --> 14:52.033
AMBULANCES THAT SOUND LIKE THIS:

14:52.100 --> 14:53.766
[WARBLING SIREN]

14:53.833 --> 14:55.600
THE VERY FACT OUR SIRENS COULD

14:55.666 --> 14:58.000
SOUND LIKE A PUCCINI ARIA

14:58.066 --> 14:59.566
PERFORMED BY A FLUSTERED

14:59.633 --> 15:01.233
PARAKEET, AND YET, WE CHOOSE FOR

15:01.300 --> 15:05.900
THAT NOT TO BE THE CASE, MAKES

15:05.966 --> 15:07.100
US A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS.

15:07.166 --> 15:07.666
BUT ALL OF THIS IS TO SAY:

15:07.733 --> 15:08.866
IF YOU'VE SEEN ONE EMS SETUP,

15:08.933 --> 15:09.433
YOU'VE SEEN EXACTLY ONE EMS

15:09.500 --> 15:10.566
SETUP.

15:10.633 --> 15:13.966
AND ONE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT

15:14.033 --> 15:15.733
THERE IS NO SINGLE FEDERAL

15:15.800 --> 15:16.633
AGENCY OVERSEEING AND SUPPORTING

15:16.700 --> 15:18.433
EMS IN THE SAME THE WAY THAT,

15:18.500 --> 15:19.866
FOR INSTANCE, FIRE DEPARTMENTS

15:19.933 --> 15:20.866
HAVE THE U.S. FIRE

15:20.933 --> 15:23.333
ADMINISTRATION.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.533
AND THE FRUSTRATING THING IS, IT

15:24.600 --> 15:25.800
DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.

15:25.866 --> 15:27.733
BACK IN 1973, CONGRESS ENACTED

15:27.800 --> 15:28.966
THE EMS SYSTEMS ACT, WHICH

15:29.033 --> 15:31.066
CREATED A NEW PROGRAM TO HELP

15:31.133 --> 15:31.766
DEVELOP REGIONAL EMS SYSTEMS,

15:31.833 --> 15:33.600
SOMETHING THAT WAS BADLY NEEDED.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.866
PRIOR TO THAT, AMBULANCE

15:34.933 --> 15:36.133
SERVICES WERE FREQUENTLY

15:36.200 --> 15:37.966
PROVIDED BY HEARSES, SIMPLY

15:38.033 --> 15:39.200
BECAUSE THEY WERE LONG ENOUGH TO

15:39.266 --> 15:40.633
TRANSPORT A HUMAN BODY.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.633
UNFORTUNATELY, UNDER THE REAGAN

15:43.700 --> 15:45.133
ADMINISTRATION, BUDGET CUTS

15:45.200 --> 15:47.800
ELIMINATED DIRECT FEDERAL

15:47.866 --> 15:49.333
FUNDING AND OVERSIGHT, SHIFTING

15:49.400 --> 15:51.500
THE RESPONSIBILITY ONTO THE

15:51.566 --> 15:52.366
STATES -- MANY OF WHICH OPTED TO

15:52.433 --> 15:54.966
DIRECT THEIR MONEY AWAY FROM EMS

15:55.033 --> 15:56.333
AND INTO OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH

15:56.400 --> 15:57.433
SERVICES INSTEAD.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.966
WHICH BRINGS US TO AN INCREDIBLE

16:00.033 --> 16:02.100
FACT: UNLIKE OTHER FIRST

16:02.166 --> 16:03.600
RESPONDERS, SUCH AS POLICE AND

16:03.666 --> 16:08.833
FIRE DEPARTMENTS, RIGHT NOW, IN

16:08.900 --> 16:09.933
ALL 39 OF THESE STATES, EMS IS

16:10.000 --> 16:11.133
NOT CONSIDERED AN ESSENTIAL

16:11.200 --> 16:12.200
SERVICE, MEANING LOCAL

16:12.266 --> 16:13.533
GOVERNMENTS DON'T HAVE TO

16:13.600 --> 16:15.466
PROVIDE IT TO THEIR CITIZENS.

16:15.533 --> 16:17.066
WHICH, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER,

16:17.133 --> 16:18.366
MEANS EMS GENERALLY HAS LESS

16:18.433 --> 16:21.433
ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT FUNDING.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.066
THIS IS A HUGE DEAL.

16:23.133 --> 16:24.600
AND IF THIS IS SURPRISING NEWS

16:24.666 --> 16:25.633
TO YOU, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.166
JUST LISTEN TO THIS UTAH STATE

16:27.233 --> 16:29.000
REPRESENTATIVE.

16:29.066 --> 16:30.966
>> I BECAME AWARE OF THE FACT

16:31.033 --> 16:34.300
THAT THIS ISSUE EXISTED WHEN I

16:34.366 --> 16:36.033
ASKED THE QUESTION TO CHIEF BRAD

16:36.100 --> 16:40.700
HANNIG, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

16:40.766 --> 16:45.166
HE STARTED EXPLAINING TO ME THIS

16:45.233 --> 16:47.933
ISSUE AND I WAS LIKE, REALLY?

16:48.000 --> 16:48.566
'CAUSE I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN

16:48.633 --> 16:49.566
ESSENTIAL SERVICE TOO.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.466
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

16:50.533 --> 16:51.366
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE HE WAS

16:51.433 --> 16:52.833
SURPRISED!

16:52.900 --> 16:54.600
FINDING OUT THAT EMS IS NOT

16:54.666 --> 16:55.833
DEEMED ESSENTIAL IS LIKE FINDING

16:55.900 --> 16:57.100
OUT THAT MOST STATES DON'T

16:57.166 --> 16:59.166
CONSIDER GEESE TO BE BIRDS.

16:59.233 --> 17:00.466
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE.

17:00.533 --> 17:01.700
THEY HAVE BEAKS, WINGS,

17:01.766 --> 17:03.666
FEATHERS, THEY RAIN SHIT FROM

17:03.733 --> 17:05.500
THE SKY, SULLY SULLENBERGER IS

17:05.566 --> 17:06.966
THEIR JEFFREY DAHMER --

17:07.033 --> 17:08.033
THEY'RE FUCKING BIRDS!

17:08.100 --> 17:09.133
I DIDN'T REALIZE ANYONE WAS EVEN

17:09.200 --> 17:11.833
DISPUTING THAT.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.700
EMS PROVIDERS CAN BE SO STRAPPED

17:13.766 --> 17:14.933
FOR CASH -- ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

17:15.033 --> 17:15.866
AREAS -- THAT THEY HAVE TO

17:15.933 --> 17:16.933
FUNDRAISE FOR THEMSELVES.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.433
DO A QUICK SEARCH ON GOFUNDME

17:18.500 --> 17:21.600
RIGHT NOW, AND YOU'LL FIND

17:21.666 --> 17:22.433
MULTIPLE OUTFITS TRYING TO RAISE

17:22.500 --> 17:23.966
MONEY FOR EQUIPMENT, GEAR, AND

17:24.033 --> 17:27.633
UPDATED AMBULANCES.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.800
AND YOU KNOW OUR HEALTHCARE

17:30.866 --> 17:32.100
SYSTEM IS FUCKED UP WHEN

17:32.166 --> 17:33.366
PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ARE

17:33.433 --> 17:34.466
RELYING ON THE SAME CROWDFUNDING

17:34.533 --> 17:34.966
PLATFORM.

17:35.033 --> 17:36.366
SOME PEOPLE EVEN DO FUNDRAISING

17:36.433 --> 17:37.300
STUNTS FOR THEIR LOCAL EMS,

17:37.366 --> 17:39.666
WHETHER IT'S THIS GUY DOING A

17:39.733 --> 17:40.300
POLAR BEAR PLUNGE FOR A THOUSAND

17:40.366 --> 17:41.233
BUCKS OR THIS DJ DOING A

17:41.300 --> 17:42.900
THREE-HOUR LIVESTREAM THAT

17:42.966 --> 17:43.533
RAISED MONEY FOR EMS WORKERS IN

17:43.600 --> 17:44.866
NEW YORK.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.633
AND I HAVE TO SAY -- MY

17:46.700 --> 17:47.433
ADMIRATION FOR THAT MAN'S

17:47.500 --> 17:49.333
GENEROSITY IS ALMOST ENOUGH TO

17:49.400 --> 17:50.500
OVERCOME MY HORROR AT THE IDEA

17:50.566 --> 17:52.266
OF A THREE-HOUR LIVESTREAM DJ

17:52.333 --> 17:54.166
SET.

17:54.233 --> 17:55.266
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE DONATING A

17:55.333 --> 17:56.466
MILLION DOLLARS TO CANCER

17:56.533 --> 17:57.933
RESEARCH BY WRITING OUT A CHECK

17:58.000 --> 17:58.666
IN TURTLE BLOOD.

17:58.733 --> 18:02.900
LOVE THE END, HATE THE MEANS.

18:02.966 --> 18:04.833
AND THESE MASSIVE FUNDING

18:04.900 --> 18:06.133
DEFICIENCIES START TO EXPLAIN

18:06.200 --> 18:08.066
WHY IT IS THAT EMS WORKERS LIKE

18:08.133 --> 18:09.566
THAT GUY YOU SAW EARLIER ARE SO

18:09.633 --> 18:11.266
TERRIBLY PAID.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.966
THE MEDIAN ANNUAL WAGE IS JUST

18:14.033 --> 18:16.033
OVER $36,000 -- WELL BELOW WHAT

18:16.100 --> 18:17.666
POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS

18:17.733 --> 18:19.533
MAKE -- AND FOR A DANGEROUS AND

18:19.600 --> 18:21.466
STRESSFUL JOB: EMTs AND

18:21.533 --> 18:22.733
PARAMEDICS HAVE AN INJURY RATE

18:22.800 --> 18:24.133
ABOUT THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL

18:24.200 --> 18:25.533
AVERAGE AND THEY'RE ROUGHLY TEN

18:25.600 --> 18:26.766
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE

18:26.833 --> 18:31.400
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR BEHAVIORS.

18:31.466 --> 18:32.566
SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT AMBULANCE

18:32.633 --> 18:34.533
SERVICES CAN HAVE REAL TROUBLE

18:34.600 --> 18:36.233
FINDING OR RETAINING WORKERS AND

18:36.300 --> 18:37.433
VOLUNTEERS, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

18:37.500 --> 18:39.600
COMMUNITIES.

18:39.666 --> 18:40.766
>> EXPERTS NOW WARN CLOSE TO ONE

18:40.833 --> 18:43.133
THIRD OF ALL RURAL MEDICAL

18:43.200 --> 18:45.566
SERVICES ARE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

18:45.633 --> 18:48.500
OF CLOSING DOWN.

18:48.566 --> 18:50.066
>> IN RURAL MARMARTH,

18:50.133 --> 18:51.866
NORTH DAKOTA, NO ONE REMEMBERS

18:51.933 --> 18:52.433
THE LAST TIME THE TOWN HAD A

18:52.500 --> 18:52.900
DOCTOR.

18:52.966 --> 18:53.900
THE AMBULANCE IS THE COMMUNITY

18:53.966 --> 18:55.300
SAFETY NET.

18:55.366 --> 18:56.733
>> WE'RE LITERALLY ONE PERSON

18:56.800 --> 18:57.400
AWAY FROM CLOSING IF WE LOSE ONE

18:57.466 --> 18:58.300
OF OUR EMTs, ONE OF OUR CARE

18:58.366 --> 18:58.766
PROVIDERS.

18:58.833 --> 18:59.933
WE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT SHUTTING

19:00.000 --> 19:01.333
DOWN AND CLOSING OUR DOORS.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.066
>> John: THAT'S TERRIBLE.

19:03.133 --> 19:04.533
NO WORKPLACE SHOULD BE IN DANGER

19:04.600 --> 19:06.300
OF SHUTTING DOWN BECAUSE IT

19:06.366 --> 19:08.400
LOSES ONE PERSON.

19:08.466 --> 19:10.333
UNLESS THAT WORKPLACE IS THE

19:10.400 --> 19:13.100
"SEX AND THE CITY" REBOOT.

19:13.166 --> 19:15.100
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

19:15.166 --> 19:16.333
IT'S NEVER GOING TO WORK WITHOUT

19:16.400 --> 19:16.800
KIM CATTRALL.

19:16.866 --> 19:17.366
IT'S NOT THAT ANY OF YOU ARE

19:17.433 --> 19:18.533
BAD, IT'S THAT YOU ONLY WORK

19:18.600 --> 19:19.333
TOGETHER.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.733
I CAN'T APPRECIATE MY PURITAN

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
CHARLOTTE IF I DON'T HAVE MY

19:21.866 --> 19:23.300
NAUGHTY SAMANTHA.

19:23.366 --> 19:26.700
AND I LIVE FOR MIRANDA HOBBES,

19:26.766 --> 19:28.566
BUT IF SHE'S NOT SERVING

19:28.633 --> 19:29.866
SIDE EYE WHILE SAMANTHA USES

19:29.933 --> 19:30.833
PENNE PASTA TO DESCRIBE HER NEW

19:30.900 --> 19:32.133
ITALIAN LOVER'S DICK, WHAT'S THE

19:32.200 --> 19:33.166
POINT?

19:33.233 --> 19:34.900
AND TO BE CLEAR, THIS ISN'T JUST

19:34.966 --> 19:37.733
A RURAL PROBLEM.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.200
SOME BIG-CITY SERVICES ARE

19:39.266 --> 19:39.800
STRETCHED TO BREAKING POINT,

19:39.866 --> 19:42.333
TOO.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.933
TAKE CHICAGO, WHERE ITS EMS IS

19:44.000 --> 19:45.433
OPERATED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.466
BOTH WORKERS AND CITY OFFICIALS

19:47.533 --> 19:48.966
HAVE COMPLAINED FOR YEARS THAT

19:49.033 --> 19:49.933
NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES HAVE BEEN

19:50.000 --> 19:51.433
ALLOCATED TO EMS, LEADING TO AN

19:51.500 --> 19:52.966
AMBULANCE SHORTAGE.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.533
AND WHILE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

19:54.600 --> 19:55.900
SAYS ITS FLEET MEETS THE NEEDS

19:55.966 --> 19:59.900
OF RESIDENTS, A LOCAL-NEWS

19:59.966 --> 20:00.466
OF RESIDENTS, A LOCAL NEWS

20:00.533 --> 20:01.133
INVESTIGATION FOUND SOME PRETTY

20:01.200 --> 20:02.433
HARROWING STORIES

20:02.500 --> 20:04.300
>> ONE ANALYSIS OF 700,000

20:04.366 --> 20:05.633
MEDICAL 911 CALLS FOUND IN 19%

20:05.700 --> 20:07.100
OF THEM IT TOOK AN AMBULANCE

20:07.166 --> 20:08.933
MORE THAN SEVEN MINUTES TO GET

20:09.000 --> 20:10.466
TO THE SCENE.

20:10.533 --> 20:11.333
SOMETIMES THERE JUST ISN'T

20:11.400 --> 20:12.133
ONE.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.033
>> WE'RE OUT OF AMBULANCES.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.000
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

20:16.066 --> 20:17.266
>> John: WOW.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.266
"WE'RE OUT OF AMBULANCES."

20:18.333 --> 20:19.200
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT

20:19.266 --> 20:21.466
TO HEAR.

20:21.533 --> 20:22.533
I THINK WE ALL KNOW, WHEN YOU

20:22.600 --> 20:24.300
CALL AN AMBULANCE, YOU

20:24.366 --> 20:24.900
WANT IT TO SHOW UP

20:24.966 --> 20:25.600
LIKE THAT.

20:25.666 --> 20:26.766
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

20:26.833 --> 20:29.233
>> John: AW, NO.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.500
I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

20:31.566 --> 20:31.866
I DID IT AGAIN.

20:31.933 --> 20:32.233
I'M SORRY.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.066
>> HOW HARD IS IT NOT TO SNAP

20:33.133 --> 20:34.200
YOUR FINGERS?

20:34.266 --> 20:36.333
>> John: Y'KNOW, IT TURNS OUT,

20:36.400 --> 20:40.200
IT IS SURPRISINGLY HARD.

20:40.266 --> 20:41.233
>> YOU KNOW, I GOT THE POWER TO

20:41.300 --> 20:41.866
CLAP MY HANDS AND SUMMON KERMIT

20:41.933 --> 20:42.800
THE FROG, DO YOU THINK I DO IT?

20:42.866 --> 20:43.400
NO, I DO NOT.

20:43.466 --> 20:44.233
BECAUSE I RESPECT KERMIT.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.600
>> John: I GET THAT.

20:45.666 --> 20:46.766
BUT, HEY, GEORGE?

20:46.833 --> 20:50.166
DO IT.

20:50.233 --> 20:52.300
DO IT NOW.

20:52.366 --> 20:55.966
PLEASE.

20:56.033 --> 20:57.400
[CLAPS]

20:57.466 --> 20:58.033
>> ALL RIGHT.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.433
>> THIS BETTER BE GOOD, GEORGE.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.766
>> IT'S NOT.

21:00.833 --> 21:01.533
>> John: WELL, I THOUGHT THAT

21:01.600 --> 21:02.333
WENT VERY WELL.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.266
ANYWAY, WHERE WERE WE?

21:04.333 --> 21:05.066
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.566
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES IN

21:06.633 --> 21:07.900
AMERICA ARE UNDERFUNDED, BECAUSE

21:08.000 --> 21:09.133
IN MOST PLACES, THEY'RE NOT

21:09.200 --> 21:10.866
SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL PROGRAMS

21:10.933 --> 21:12.033
AND LOCAL DOLLARS THE WAY THAT

21:12.100 --> 21:17.033
POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.166
AND THE FACT THEY ARE SO

21:18.233 --> 21:19.300
UNDERFUNDED STARTS TO EXPLAIN

21:19.366 --> 21:20.233
WHY THEY CAN COST SO MUCH.

21:20.300 --> 21:21.833
BECAUSE FOR MANY, THE WAY THEY

21:21.900 --> 21:23.300
RECOUP THEIR COSTS IS BY BILLING

21:23.366 --> 21:24.466
PATIENTS.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.033
ALTHOUGH INTERESTINGLY, IF THEY

21:26.100 --> 21:27.333
DON'T PHYSICALLY TRANSPORT THOSE

21:27.400 --> 21:28.700
PATIENTS TO A HOSPITAL, THEY CAN

21:28.766 --> 21:31.333
BE OUT OF LUCK.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.900
>> YOU'RE REIMBURSED BASED ON

21:32.966 --> 21:34.733
THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT YOU

21:34.800 --> 21:36.300
TRANSPORT TO A HOSPITAL.

21:36.366 --> 21:37.366
SO YOU COULD GET CALLED 1,000

21:37.433 --> 21:39.733
TIMES A YEAR AND ONLY TRANSPORT

21:39.800 --> 21:41.466
750 PATIENTS.

21:41.533 --> 21:42.500
THOSE OTHER 250 CALLS, YOU MADE

21:42.566 --> 21:45.666
NO MONEY ON.

21:45.733 --> 21:46.333
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.066
AND POLICIES LIKE THAT CAN NOT

21:47.133 --> 21:48.500
ONLY PUT EMS PROVIDERS EVEN

21:48.566 --> 21:49.300
FURTHER INTO A FINANCIAL HOLE,

21:49.366 --> 21:50.700
IT CAN ALSO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO

21:50.766 --> 21:52.000
TAKE PATIENTS TO THE HOSPITAL,

21:52.066 --> 21:52.566
EVEN IF IT'S NOT TOTALLY

21:52.633 --> 21:55.166
NECESSARY.

21:55.233 --> 21:57.233
WHICH MAKES NO SENSE.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.133
IT'S A PRACTICE KNOWN THROUGHOUT

21:59.200 --> 22:00.300
THE EMS INDUSTRY AS "YOU CALL,

22:00.366 --> 22:02.600
WE HAUL," WHICH IS A FUN PHRASE,

22:02.666 --> 22:04.266
ALTHOUGH TO BE HONEST, NOWHERE

22:04.333 --> 22:05.766
NEAR AS FUN AS THE FIRE

22:05.833 --> 22:08.133
DEPARTMENT'S MOTTO:

22:08.200 --> 22:08.733
"YOU HURT?

22:08.800 --> 22:09.833
WE SQUIRT."

22:09.900 --> 22:11.100
AND EMS'S FUNDING STRUCTURE

22:11.166 --> 22:11.900
DOESN'T JUST SERVE PROVIDERS

22:11.966 --> 22:12.800
POORLY -- IT SERVES PATIENTS

22:12.866 --> 22:16.333
POORLY TOO.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.166
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, PATIENTS AND

22:18.233 --> 22:23.733
THEIR INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS,

22:23.800 --> 22:25.333
ARE MOST EMS OUTFIT'S PRIMARY

22:25.400 --> 22:27.466
FUNDING SOURCES, WHICH IS NOT A

22:27.533 --> 22:28.266
GOOD SITUATION FOR EITHER SIDE.

22:28.333 --> 22:29.066
SOME PATIENTS HAVE MEDICARE AND

22:29.133 --> 22:29.933
MEDICAID -- AND BY LAW, EMS

22:30.000 --> 22:32.066
PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO ACCEPT

22:32.133 --> 22:32.633
THEIR REIMBURSEMENT RATES,

22:32.700 --> 22:33.233
DESPITE MANY SAYING THEY'RE SET

22:33.300 --> 22:34.200
TOO LOW.

22:34.266 --> 22:44.066
BUT FOR PATIENTS WITH PRIVATE

22:44.133 --> 22:44.766
INSURANCE, THE FACT IS, EMSes

22:44.833 --> 22:45.400
ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ACCEPT THAT

22:45.466 --> 22:46.166
AT ALL.

22:46.233 --> 22:46.900
IN FACT, MANY CHOOSE TO KEEP

22:46.966 --> 22:47.533
THEMSELVES OUT OF NETWORK FOR

22:47.600 --> 22:48.166
MOST INSURERS, MEANING THEY CAN

22:48.233 --> 22:48.866
GENERALLY SET THEIR RATES

22:48.933 --> 22:49.633
WHEREVER THEY WANT.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.666
THIS SITUATION CAN OFTEN LEAVE

22:50.733 --> 22:51.300
PATIENTS FACING SO-CALLED

22:51.366 --> 22:52.133
"SURPRISE BILLS."

22:52.200 --> 22:53.466
SOME OF WHICH CAN BE ABSOLUTELY

22:53.533 --> 22:56.000
RIDICULOUS.

22:56.066 --> 22:57.666
>> BABY SAWYER JUST COULDN'T

22:57.733 --> 22:59.200
WAIT TO ENTER THE WORLD.

22:59.266 --> 23:00.466
KATIE MORAIDA'S WATER BROKE A

23:00.533 --> 23:02.366
WEEK BEFORE HE WAS DUE.

23:02.433 --> 23:03.300
SHE AND HUSBAND DANIEL RACED

23:03.366 --> 23:05.866
TO SUTTER ROSEVILLE.

23:05.933 --> 23:09.766
WITH THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN

23:09.833 --> 23:12.500
SIGHT, KATIE SCREAMS FOR HIM TO

23:12.566 --> 23:13.166
STOP THE CAR.

23:13.233 --> 23:14.433
>> HE SAID, "DON'T PUSH."

23:14.500 --> 23:15.033
AND I SAID, "I HAVE TO PUSH."

23:15.100 --> 23:15.500
>> SHE WENT LIKE THIS.

23:15.566 --> 23:16.300
>> AND I PUSHED.

23:16.366 --> 23:17.066
AND THEN POP!

23:17.133 --> 23:18.233
AND HE CAME OUT!

23:18.300 --> 23:18.766
>> ROSEVILLE PD CALLED THE

23:18.833 --> 23:19.266
PARAMEDICS, WHO CUT THE

23:19.333 --> 23:19.866
UMBILICAL CORD AND DROVE KATIE

23:19.933 --> 23:20.466
AND SAWYER A MATTER OF A FEW

23:20.533 --> 23:21.066
HUNDRED YARDS TO THE HOSPITAL

23:21.133 --> 23:22.333
DOOR.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.133
THE ENTIRE TIME WITH A

23:23.200 --> 23:24.500
PARAMEDIC, 10 MINUTES.

23:24.566 --> 23:26.300
>> IT IS SUCH A BLUR.

23:26.366 --> 23:28.700
>> BUT LATER IT WOULD COME INTO

23:28.766 --> 23:29.933
FOCUS WHEN TWO EQUAL AMR

23:30.000 --> 23:31.666
AMBULANCE BILLS SHOWED UP, ONE

23:31.733 --> 23:33.066
FOR KATIE, ONE FOR BABY SAWYER,

23:33.133 --> 23:35.633
TOTALING MORE THAN 3,500 BUCKS.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.233
>> NOT EVEN A FULL MINUTE WORTH

23:37.300 --> 23:37.866
OF AN AMBULANCE RIDE.

23:37.933 --> 23:39.033
WE HAD ALREADY DONE THE HARD

23:39.100 --> 23:39.500
PART.

23:39.566 --> 23:43.400
WE DELIVERED OUR CHILD IN THE

23:43.466 --> 23:43.866
FRONT SEAT OF OUR CAR.

23:43.933 --> 23:46.333
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON THERE.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.633
DID "WE" REALLY DO THE HARD

23:49.700 --> 23:50.533
PART, DAN?

23:50.600 --> 23:51.633
BECAUSE FROM WHAT I JUST HEARD,

23:51.700 --> 23:52.233
YOU DID SOME DRIVING, AND THEN

23:52.300 --> 23:53.033
SAT BACK WHILE YOUR WIFE -- IN

23:53.100 --> 23:54.033
YOUR WORDS -- "POPPED" OUT A

23:54.100 --> 23:56.766
HUMAN, SO I'M NOT SURE YOU

23:56.833 --> 23:57.533
REALLY "DID THE HARD PART," SO

23:57.600 --> 23:58.500
MUCH AS YOU WERE JUST SORT OF

23:58.566 --> 23:59.466
THERE.

23:59.533 --> 24:00.133
C'MON, DAN.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.000
BE AN ALLY.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.766
READ A TWEET.

24:02.833 --> 24:03.800
AND THERE CAN BE ABSOLUTELY

24:03.866 --> 24:04.833
CRAZY EXAMPLES OF SURPRISE

24:04.900 --> 24:05.966
BILLING, EVEN WHEN EMS IS RUN BY

24:06.033 --> 24:08.100
THE CITY.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.133
IN HOUSTON, LITERALLY ALL

24:09.200 --> 24:10.733
CITY-RUN AMBULANCE SERVICES ARE

24:10.800 --> 24:12.133
OUT-OF-NETWORK FOR ALL INSURERS.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.600
AND A STUDY OF ONE LARGE

24:14.666 --> 24:16.166
NATIONAL INSURANCE PLAN FOUND

24:16.233 --> 24:17.800
THAT 71% OF AMBULANCE RIDES HAD

24:17.866 --> 24:19.566
THE POTENTIAL TO GENERATE A

24:19.633 --> 24:22.366
SURPRISE BILL.

24:22.433 --> 24:23.933
AND WHEN YOU KNOW THAT, IS IT

24:24.000 --> 24:25.466
ANY WONDER THAT WOMAN BEGGED

24:25.533 --> 24:28.100
PEOPLE NOT TO CALL AN AMBULANCE?

24:28.166 --> 24:29.400
OR THAT THIS INCREDIBLY GRIM

24:29.466 --> 24:30.866
TREND HAS EMERGED:

24:30.933 --> 24:34.266
>> AMBULANCE OR UBER?

24:34.333 --> 24:35.733
THAT'S NOW THE CHOICE AS MORE

24:35.800 --> 24:37.133
AMERICANS ARE USING UBER AND

24:37.200 --> 24:38.533
OTHER CAR SERVICES TO GET TO THE

24:38.600 --> 24:42.000
EMERGENCY ROOM.

24:42.066 --> 24:42.900
42-YEAR-OLD TECH MAGAZINE WRITER

24:42.966 --> 24:43.866
CHANDRA STEELE DID IT.

24:43.933 --> 24:44.733
>> WHAT WERE YOUR SYMPTOMS?

24:44.800 --> 24:45.733
>> I HAD SOME INTERNAL BLEEDING

24:45.800 --> 24:46.766
WHICH I ALREADY --

24:46.833 --> 24:47.766
>> YOU HAD INTERNAL BLEEDING AND

24:47.833 --> 24:48.466
YOU TOOK AN UBER TO THE

24:48.533 --> 24:50.566
HOSPITAL?

24:50.633 --> 24:51.400
>> EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR ROBERT

24:51.466 --> 24:52.333
GLATTER OF LENOX HILL HOSPITAL

24:52.400 --> 24:53.433
IN NEW YORK SAYS UBER E.R., AS

24:53.500 --> 24:54.866
IT'S BEEN NICKNAMED, IS NOT A

24:54.933 --> 25:05.366
SMART IDEA IN A CRISIS.

25:05.433 --> 25:06.866
>> THEY DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF

25:06.933 --> 25:07.366
OXYGEN, THEY DON'T HAVE

25:07.433 --> 25:08.000
INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS OR IVs, THEY

25:08.066 --> 25:08.500
DON'T HAVE PARAMEDICS.

25:08.566 --> 25:09.266
THAT'S THE MAIN DIFFERENCE.

25:09.333 --> 25:12.966
THEY HAVE A DRIVER.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.166
>> John: RIGHT!

25:14.233 --> 25:14.500
THEY ALSO MAY

25:14.566 --> 25:15.133
NOT KNOW WHICH LOCAL HOSPITAL

25:15.200 --> 25:16.200
HAS A TRAUMA, STROKE, CARDIAC,

25:16.266 --> 25:16.600
OR PEDIATRIC UNIT.

25:16.666 --> 25:17.200
BECAUSE THEY'RE UBER DRIVERS.

25:17.266 --> 25:17.766
THE MOST THEY HAVE ARE TINY

25:17.833 --> 25:18.733
WATER BOTTLES YOU'RE AFRAID TO

25:18.800 --> 25:19.633
DRINK FROM AND A CHARGER FOR A

25:19.700 --> 25:20.300
SAMSUNG PHONE YOU DO NOT OWN.

25:20.366 --> 25:21.033
SO TO RECAP: INSTEAD OF ALL OF

25:21.100 --> 25:22.700
US PAYING A LITTLE BIT ALL THE

25:22.766 --> 25:24.800
TIME FOR AMBULANCES, WE HAVE A

25:24.866 --> 25:26.266
SYSTEM WHERE SOME OF US PAY AN

25:26.333 --> 25:28.400
AWFUL LOT ALL AT ONCE WHEN WE

25:28.466 --> 25:30.833
HAVE A TERRIBLE EMERGENCY.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.266
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "HOW

25:32.333 --> 25:33.333
COULD THIS POSSIBLY GET ANY

25:33.400 --> 25:36.066
WORSE?"

25:36.133 --> 25:37.366
WELL, WAIT, IT CAN.

25:37.433 --> 25:38.700
BECAUSE FOR-PROFIT BUSINESSES

25:38.766 --> 25:40.100
ARE ALSO INVOLVED HERE -- IN

25:40.166 --> 25:40.666
FACT, CURRENTLY, PRIVATE

25:40.733 --> 25:42.800
COMPANIES REPRESENT ABOUT 25% OF

25:42.866 --> 25:45.833
ALL AMBULANCE PROVIDERS.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.200
AND MANY OF THEM ARE OWNED BY

25:47.266 --> 25:48.533
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS WHO'VE BEEN

25:48.600 --> 25:49.700
ACQUIRING DISTRESSED LOCAL

25:49.766 --> 25:51.200
AMBULANCE PROVIDERS FOR DECADES.

25:51.266 --> 25:52.266
REMEMBER THAT BABY WHO GOT A

25:52.333 --> 25:56.133
BILL FOR BEING BORN?

25:56.200 --> 25:57.000
THAT CAME FROM A PRIVATE

25:57.066 --> 25:58.600
FOR-PROFIT COMPANY, AMERICAN

25:58.666 --> 26:00.966
MEDICAL RESPONSE.

26:01.033 --> 26:02.166
THEY'RE CURRENTLY THE LARGEST

26:02.233 --> 26:03.833
AMBULANCE COMPANY IN THE U.S.

26:03.900 --> 26:04.400
AND ARE OWNED BY ONE OF THE

26:04.466 --> 26:05.300
COUNTRY'S LARGEST PRIVATE EQUITY

26:05.366 --> 26:07.033
FIRMS.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.100
AND WHEN A PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM

26:09.166 --> 26:11.633
SWOOPS IN TO HELP WRING PROFITS

26:11.700 --> 26:12.533
OUT OF AMBULANCE SERVICES BY

26:12.600 --> 26:13.900
KEEPING COSTS LOW AND REVENUES

26:13.966 --> 26:15.166
HIGH, THINGS GENERALLY DON'T

26:15.233 --> 26:18.500
CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.

26:18.566 --> 26:19.600
TAKE TRANSCARE, AN EMS COMPANY

26:19.666 --> 26:21.233
ACQUIRED OUT OF BANKRUPTCY BY A

26:21.300 --> 26:23.466
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM RUN BY THIS

26:23.533 --> 26:25.266
WOMAN, LYNN TILTON.

26:25.333 --> 26:28.433
AND A FEW THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT

26:28.500 --> 26:31.700
ASIDE FROM SERVING LOOKS THAT

26:31.766 --> 26:33.266
CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS

26:33.333 --> 26:35.300
"MY STYLE ICONS ARE WAYNE NEWTON

26:35.366 --> 26:36.700
AND A FERRERO ROCHER CANDY,"

26:36.766 --> 26:39.333
LYNN TILTON IS A SELF-DESCRIBED

26:39.400 --> 26:40.966
POET, ALREADY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

26:41.033 --> 26:41.533
RED FLAGS IMAGINABLE.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.633
WE LOOKED, AND ONE OF THE ONLY

26:42.700 --> 26:43.966
THINGS CLOSE TO POETRY WE COULD

26:44.033 --> 26:45.300
FIND FROM HER WAS THIS INSTAGRAM

26:45.366 --> 26:47.533
POST: "I AM A WOMAN OF STRENGTH,

26:47.600 --> 26:49.866
NOTHING CAN BREAK MY SPIRIT,

26:49.933 --> 26:52.800
I AM WILD AND FREE,

26:52.866 --> 26:53.833
I AM A WARRIOR OF LIGHT,

26:53.900 --> 26:54.733
I AM ME."

26:54.800 --> 26:55.466
WHICH FEELS LESS LIKE REAL

26:55.533 --> 26:56.466
POETRY AND MORE LIKE SOMEONE

26:56.533 --> 26:57.400
WITH A CONCUSSION TRYING TO

26:57.466 --> 26:58.366
REMEMBER KESHA LYRICS.

26:58.433 --> 26:59.666
LYNN TILTON WAS ALSO THE STAR OF

26:59.733 --> 27:01.466
THE SADLY CANCELED REALITY

27:01.533 --> 27:03.300
SERIES "DIVA OF DISTRESSED,"

27:03.366 --> 27:04.366
WHERE SHE PORTRAYED HERSELF AS A

27:04.433 --> 27:06.100
SAVIOR OF TROUBLED COMPANIES IN

27:06.166 --> 27:09.900
INSPIRATIONAL MOMENTS LIKE THIS:

27:09.966 --> 27:11.933
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO IS WE

27:12.000 --> 27:13.466
ALL COMMIT.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.266
SO I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ALL TO

27:15.333 --> 27:16.766
COMMIT WITH ME THAT WE WILL NOT

27:16.833 --> 27:18.666
STOP UNTIL WE'VE ACHIEVED OUR

27:18.733 --> 27:20.566
GOAL.

27:20.633 --> 27:21.300
I COMMIT!

27:21.366 --> 27:22.366
>> WE COMMIT.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.433
>> THANK YOU.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.833
COMMIT, COMMIT!

27:24.900 --> 27:27.200
NO PUSSIES IN MY MILL!

27:27.266 --> 27:32.866
>> John: SHE SEEMS GREAT.

27:32.933 --> 27:34.200
AND LYNN TILTON CERTAINLY KNOWS

27:34.266 --> 27:35.366
HOW TO INSTILL A SENSE OF

27:35.433 --> 27:36.233
COURAGE IN THOSE AROUND HER.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.133
REMINDS ME OF THAT FAMOUS FDR

27:37.200 --> 27:37.733
QUOTE: "THE ONLY THING WE HAVE

27:37.800 --> 27:40.466
TO FEAR IS PUSSIES IN MY MILL."

27:40.533 --> 27:41.833
AND TILTON PROMISED TO BRING

27:41.900 --> 27:43.100
THAT UPLIFTING LEADERSHIP TO

27:43.166 --> 27:45.333
TRANSCARE.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.800
BUT MANY WHO WORKED THERE

27:46.866 --> 27:48.566
DESCRIBED ROUGH CONDITIONS ON

27:48.633 --> 27:50.433
HER WATCH, WITH ONE FORMER

27:50.500 --> 27:51.733
EMPLOYEE SAYING THEY WERE SENT

27:51.800 --> 27:53.433
OUT IN A VEHICLE WHERE THE

27:53.500 --> 27:54.833
BRAKES DIDN'T WORK PROPERLY AND

27:54.900 --> 27:56.000
DURING THE 2014 EBOLA SCARE HAD

27:56.066 --> 27:57.333
TROUBLE GETTING ENOUGH SANITARY

27:57.400 --> 27:58.100
WIPES TO DISINFECT THEIR

27:58.166 --> 28:00.366
AMBULANCES.

28:00.433 --> 28:02.100
FORMER STAFF EVEN SAID THEY WERE

28:02.166 --> 28:03.800
PRESSURED BY TRANSCARE

28:03.866 --> 28:05.266
SUPERVISORS TO GO "E.R.

28:05.333 --> 28:08.100
SHOPPING," MEANING THEY'D STEAL

28:08.166 --> 28:08.900
MEDICAL SUPPLIES FROM THE E.R.s

28:08.966 --> 28:11.233
TO RESTOCK THEIR AMBULANCES.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.133
AND WHEN TRANSCARE INEVITABLY

28:13.200 --> 28:15.000
ENDED UP FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY

28:15.066 --> 28:18.466
IN 2016, ITS EMPLOYEES FOUND OUT

28:18.533 --> 28:19.100
THAT THEY'D LOST THEIR JOBS LIKE

28:19.166 --> 28:19.900
THIS.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.266
>> WORKERS WERE TOLD THEY HAD 30

28:21.333 --> 28:22.000
DAYS LEFT ON THE JOB.

28:22.066 --> 28:23.366
THEY SHOWED UP TODAY TO FIND

28:23.433 --> 28:25.533
THIS.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.633
TRANSCARE WAS SHUTTERED.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.000
>> I WAS IN SHOCK.

28:30.066 --> 28:31.100
WE WERE ALL IN SHOCK.

28:31.166 --> 28:36.666
>> IT WAS HORRIBLE.

28:36.733 --> 28:37.333
IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.033
>> A WORK EMERGENCY FOR DOZENS

28:38.100 --> 28:38.533
OF PARAMEDICS.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.266
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO FIND

28:39.333 --> 28:40.100
ANOTHER JOB.

28:40.166 --> 28:40.966
I HAVE ANOTHER SIDE JOB TO

28:41.033 --> 28:42.100
SUPPORT ME RIGHT NOW, CURRENTLY,

28:42.166 --> 28:44.666
BUT THAT DOESN'T PAY THE BILLS.

28:44.733 --> 28:45.666
>> LAST NIGHT WE WERE TOLD, "SEE

28:45.733 --> 28:47.433
YOU TOMORROW.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.433
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT."

28:50.500 --> 28:51.066
>> John: WELL, THAT'S FUCKED UP.

28:51.133 --> 28:51.700
THERE ARE CERTAIN BUSINESSES YOU

28:51.766 --> 28:52.500
ASSUME MIGHT DISAPPEAR

28:52.566 --> 28:54.866
OVERNIGHT, LIKE A KID'S LEMONADE

28:54.933 --> 28:55.500
STAND OR ANY CIRCUIT CITY IN

28:55.566 --> 28:57.000
THE LATE 2000s.

28:57.066 --> 28:58.866
INCIDENTALLY, THEY ALL BECAME

28:58.933 --> 29:01.000
KINGDOMS OF OPTICAL CABLES AND

29:01.066 --> 29:01.900
LOOSE BATTERIES GOVERNED BY

29:01.966 --> 29:02.466
RATS, AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

29:02.533 --> 29:05.166
FINE.

29:05.233 --> 29:06.100
BUT IT IS NOT GREAT WHEN WHAT'S

29:06.166 --> 29:06.700
DISAPPEARING IS A COMMUNITY'S

29:06.766 --> 29:08.133
LIFE-SAVING MEDICAL SERVICE.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.733
AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT TRANSCARE

29:09.800 --> 29:11.366
FOLDED -- IT'S THAT, IN A

29:11.433 --> 29:12.800
BANKRUPTCY COURT RULING LAST

29:12.866 --> 29:14.166
YEAR, A JUDGE RECOMMENDED

29:14.233 --> 29:15.933
FINDING TILTON LIABLE FOR NEARLY

29:16.000 --> 29:17.266
$42 MILLION FOR STRIPPING VALUE

29:17.333 --> 29:18.866
OUT OF THE COMPANY.

29:18.933 --> 29:21.933
WHICH ISN'T TOTALLY SHOCKING

29:22.000 --> 29:23.566
FROM A WOMAN WHOSE EMPLOYEES

29:23.633 --> 29:27.500
WERE ENCOURAGED TO STRIP VALUE

29:27.566 --> 29:28.300
OUT OF FUCKING EMERGENCY ROOMS.

29:28.366 --> 29:29.333
NOW, I HAVE TO SAY: TILTON

29:29.400 --> 29:30.333
DENIES HAVING DONE ANYTHING

29:30.400 --> 29:31.866
WRONG AND HAS CHALLENGED THAT

29:31.933 --> 29:33.233
RECOMMENDATION IN FEDERAL COURT.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.500
AND THE THING IS, I'M NOT JUST

29:35.566 --> 29:37.233
MAD WITH LYNN TILTON HERE.

29:37.300 --> 29:38.733
I'M MAD THAT WE'RE OPERATING A

29:38.800 --> 29:40.500
SYSTEM WHERE A VITAL SERVICE IS

29:40.566 --> 29:41.933
LEFT VULNERABLE TO THE

29:42.000 --> 29:44.200
LYNN TILTONS OF THE WORLD.

29:44.266 --> 29:45.400
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS?

29:45.466 --> 29:47.033
WELL, AS I'VE SAID BEFORE,

29:47.100 --> 29:48.000
IDEALLY, WE'D TRANSITION TO A

29:48.066 --> 29:49.266
MEDICARE FOR ALL APPROACH, BUT

29:49.333 --> 29:49.866
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN THE

29:49.933 --> 29:51.300
CARDS RIGHT NOW.

29:51.366 --> 29:52.833
AND IN THE MEANTIME, THERE ARE

29:52.900 --> 29:55.600
SMALLER THINGS WE COULD DO.

29:55.666 --> 29:57.233
FOR PATIENTS, WE NEED TO PUT AN

29:57.300 --> 29:59.300
END TO SURPRISE BILLING.

29:59.366 --> 30:01.100
THE GOOD NEWS IS, CONGRESS

30:01.166 --> 30:04.033
PASSED A BILL LAST YEAR CALLED

30:04.100 --> 30:05.133
THE "NO SURPRISES ACT," MAKING

30:05.200 --> 30:07.466
IT ILLEGAL TO SEND PATIENTS

30:07.533 --> 30:08.266
STEEP MEDICAL BILLS WHEN AN

30:08.333 --> 30:09.166
OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDER IS

30:09.233 --> 30:10.000
UNEXPECTEDLY INVOLVED IN THEIR

30:10.066 --> 30:11.200
CARE.

30:11.266 --> 30:13.066
THE BAD NEWS IS, WHILE THAT

30:13.133 --> 30:15.700
APPLIES TO AIR AMBULANCES, THE

30:15.766 --> 30:16.166
BILL, FOR SOME REASON,

30:16.233 --> 30:17.666
EXPLICITLY CARVED OUT GROUND

30:17.733 --> 30:17.966
AMBULANCES.

30:18.033 --> 30:18.933
IN OTHER WORDS: MOST FUCKING

30:19.000 --> 30:21.500
AMBULANCES.

30:21.566 --> 30:22.733
AS FOR EMS PROVIDERS: WE SHOULD

30:22.800 --> 30:24.066
ESTABLISH A LEAD FEDERAL AGENCY

30:24.133 --> 30:26.433
DEDICATED TO THEM.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.466
AND THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

30:27.533 --> 30:29.066
LABELED AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE.

30:29.133 --> 30:30.566
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

30:30.633 --> 30:33.000
EVERYONE THINKS THEY ARE.

30:33.066 --> 30:34.600
BUT FOR THAT LABEL TO MEAN

30:34.666 --> 30:36.500
SOMETHING, IT HAS TO COME WITH

30:36.566 --> 30:37.900
FUNDING AT THE LOCAL, STATE, AND

30:37.966 --> 30:39.600
FEDERAL LEVELS.

30:39.666 --> 30:40.866
AND THERE'S NO BETTER TIME TO

30:40.933 --> 30:43.033
MAKE THOSE BIG CHANGES THAN

30:43.100 --> 30:43.900
RIGHT NOW, WHEN WE STILL

30:43.966 --> 30:44.966
REMEMBER THE ABSOLUTE HELL OF

30:45.033 --> 30:46.733
WHAT THESE WORKERS WENT THROUGH

30:46.800 --> 30:49.133
LAST YEAR.

30:49.200 --> 30:49.966
REMEMBER THAT PARADE THAT BILL

30:50.033 --> 30:51.133
DE BLASIO PROMISED?

30:51.200 --> 30:52.833
IT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE LAST

30:52.900 --> 30:53.700
MONTH, BUT YOU KNOW WHO NOTABLY

30:53.766 --> 30:55.466
DIDN'T ATTEND?

30:55.533 --> 30:57.066
EMTs, MANY OF WHOM BOYCOTTED IT

30:57.133 --> 30:58.966
BECAUSE OF STAGNANT WAGES AND

30:59.033 --> 31:01.066
THE FACT THAT THEY WORKED DURING

31:01.133 --> 31:04.566
THE PANDEMIC WITHOUT HAZARD PAY.

31:04.633 --> 31:06.500
LOOK: LAST YEAR, EVERYONE WAS

31:06.566 --> 31:09.033
ANXIOUS TO SHOW HOW MUCH THEY

31:09.100 --> 31:11.233
SUPPORTED EMTs.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.066
WELL, NOW'S THE TIME TO PROVE IT

31:13.133 --> 31:14.200
AND MAKE BIG CHANGES ON THEIR

31:14.266 --> 31:15.700
BEHALF.

31:15.766 --> 31:18.666
AND IF WE DO THAT, MAYBE WE'LL

31:18.733 --> 31:20.966
COLLECTIVELY BE WORTHY OF A

31:21.033 --> 31:21.933
SIREN THAT SOUNDS LIKE THIS:

31:22.000 --> 31:28.266
[WARBLING SIREN]

31:28.333 --> 31:29.766
GET YOURS, MICKEY, YOU FILTHY

31:29.833 --> 31:30.333
MOUSE.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.300
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

31:31.366 --> 31:33.100
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

31:33.166 --> 31:33.700
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

31:33.766 --> 31:34.766
GOOD NIGHT!
