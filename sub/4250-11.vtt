- OKAY, WELL, FIRST,
FIND OUT WHO SLEEPY IS,

10:30.629 --> 10:32.590
AND SECOND, STOP GREAT EVIL.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.632
ANY QUESTIONS?

10:41.515 --> 10:44.393
- WHOA.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.854
- YEP.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.230
- FABIAN, LETS JUST TAKE A PHOTO

10:48.314 --> 10:51.650
AND GET BACK
BEFORE WE'RE MISSED.

10:51.734 --> 10:56.697
- IT'S TOO BLURRY
THROUGH THAT GLASS.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.450
IT'S ON THE INSIDE.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.661
- OKAY, THEN LETS LOSE
THE GLASS.

11:11.879 --> 11:12.797
[all shouting]

11:12.880 --> 11:14.340
- PUT IT BACK!

11:14.423 --> 11:16.884
[bell ringing]

11:16.967 --> 11:18.594
PUT IT BACK!

11:22.765 --> 11:23.599
[bell ringing]

11:23.682 --> 11:26.352
- PUT IT BACK.
PUT IT BACK!

11:29.563 --> 11:31.107
- FABIAN, WHAT HAVE WE DONE?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.733
- WAIT.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.738
[bell stops ringing]

11:39.615 --> 11:41.659
- [sighs]

11:44.870 --> 11:46.247
IT'S HIM.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.460
IT'S FROBISHER,

11:51.544 --> 11:53.504
FROBISHER-SMYTHE.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.929
[indistinct chatter]

12:04.098 --> 12:05.975
- I HOPE THIS HALF-EMPTY CLASS
IS UNRELATED

12:06.058 --> 12:07.601
TO THE FACT
YOUR HISTORY PRESENTATIONS

12:07.685 --> 12:08.602
ARE DUE TODAY.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.603
[P.A. humming]

12:09.687 --> 12:10.729
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

12:10.813 --> 12:12.481
PLEASE PROCEED
IN AN ORDERLY FASHION

12:12.565 --> 12:13.649
TO THE COMMON ROOM,

12:13.732 --> 12:15.067
WHERE WE'RE PERFORMING

12:15.151 --> 12:17.153
A SHORT, ENLIGHTENING
HISTORICAL PRESENTATION...

12:17.236 --> 12:18.779
- UNORTHODOX.

12:18.863 --> 12:19.822
- WITH FREE REFRESHMENTS!

12:23.993 --> 12:25.661
- HOW?
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.329
- THERE'S NO QUESTION IT'S HIM.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.999
IT'S AMAZING.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.709
- VICTOR ALWAYS THOUGHT
FROBISHER

12:31.792 --> 12:34.879
POSSESSED THE SECRET
TO ETERNAL LIFE.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.255
- IF THAT'S ETERNAL LIFE,

12:36.338 --> 12:38.507
THEN I AM SO GLAD
THAT I'M MORTAL.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.467
- [chuckles]

12:39.550 --> 12:41.135
- STUCK IN A TANK FOREVER?

12:41.218 --> 12:43.262
- WELL, NOT IF THEY
COMPLETE THE CEREMONY,

12:43.345 --> 12:45.347
WHICH WE'RE NO CLOSER
TO WORKING OUT.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.183
- YEAH, BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

12:47.266 --> 12:48.142
OF WHERE TO LOOK.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.268
- YEAH, FROBISHER'S ANTECHAMBER.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.604
- THE ANSWER MUST BE
IN ONE OF HIS BOOKS.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.772
I VOTE WE GO NOW, TONIGHT.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.191
- BUT WHAT ABOUT ALFIE?

12:55.274 --> 12:58.486
ISN'T HE STILL
TAKING COVER FROM ZOMBIES?

12:58.569 --> 12:59.904
- LEAVE HIM TO ME.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.407
- MARA MUFFINS, EVERYBODY?

13:03.491 --> 13:05.618
FRESHLY BAKED THIS MORNING.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.411
THERE'S ONE FOR YOU
AND ONE FOR YOU.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.331
THERE YOU ARE.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.043
FOLLOW ME.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.378
HAVE A SEAT, EVERYONE.
HAVE A SEAT.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.296
- [whispering]
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:17.379 --> 13:20.049
- I'LL SHOW YOU.
HAVE A SEAT.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.608
- GREAT WOMEN
HAVE SHAPED THE WORLD

13:37.691 --> 13:39.944
SINCE TIME BEGAN.

13:40.027 --> 13:44.240
OUR STORY STARTS
WITH HELEN OF TROY,

13:44.323 --> 13:46.492
WHOSE FACE LAUNCHED 1,000 SHIPS.

13:46.575 --> 13:50.454
WE GO NOW TO ANCIENT BRITAIN,

13:50.538 --> 13:52.248
AS BOUDICCA REPELS
THE ROMAN ARMIES.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.707
- EVERY TIME YOU GIVE THAT LOOK,

13:53.791 --> 13:56.210
I'M GONNA HIT YOU WITH THIS.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.587
CALL IT AVERSION THERAPY.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.422
- THE SPANISH ARMADA.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.131
- I'M JUST GONNA HIT HER.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.551
I'M JUST GONNA HIT HER.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.387
- PRESENT DAY...

14:06.470 --> 14:08.597
[chuckles]

14:08.681 --> 14:10.266
AND THE MOST AMAZING GIRL
I'VE EVER MET.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.767
- OR MAYBE I'LL JUST HIT JEROME.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.853
- MARA, I WANT TO BE
BY YOUR SIDE

14:14.937 --> 14:17.731
WHEN YOU MAKE HISTORY.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.693
I DON'T WORK PROPERLY
WITHOUT YOU.

14:20.776 --> 14:24.947
I AM REALLY SORRY
I MESSED UP.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.617
- HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE
BEING DUMPED, DOES HE?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.828
- VERY TOUCHING, JEROME,

14:30.911 --> 14:34.081
BUT THIS IS A HISTORY PROJECT,
NOT A MARRIAGE PROPOSAL.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.457
FAIL.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.458
- [clapping]

14:36.542 --> 14:39.795
EVERYONE BACK
TO THEIR CLASSROOMS NOW.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.634
NOT YOU, JEROME.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.310
HIJACKING ASSIGNMENTS,
INTERRUPTING LESSONS,

14:54.393 --> 14:56.353
BREAKING INTO MY OFFICE,

14:56.437 --> 15:00.024
ZEN GARDENS?

15:00.107 --> 15:03.944
I SHOULD CALL YOUR PARENTS.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.155
- SHOULD BUT WON'T?

15:06.238 --> 15:09.658
- YOU WILL SERVE DETENTION,
BOTH OF YOU,

15:09.742 --> 15:14.371
AND AS YOU'RE SO FOND
OF "CREATING DRAMA,"

15:14.455 --> 15:17.833
THE COSTUME CUPBOARD
IS OVERDUE A SPRING CLEAN,

15:17.916 --> 15:23.297
WHICH YOU WILL DO EVERY DAY
FOR A WEEK!

15:23.380 --> 15:24.840
OUT.

15:24.923 --> 15:26.342
- BUT WE'RE JUST STARTING
THE NEGOTIATING--

15:26.425 --> 15:28.177
- GET OUT!

15:32.931 --> 15:35.225
- EPIC ROMANTIC FAIL, JEROME.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.228
MARA'S NOT THAT STUPID.

15:38.312 --> 15:42.024
- SO SPEAKS OUR RESIDENT
RELATIONSHIP EXPERT.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.150
TELL ME, JOY.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.361
HOW ARE THINGS
WITH YOU AND FABIAN?

15:45.444 --> 15:47.279
SORRY?

15:47.363 --> 15:48.238
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

15:48.322 --> 15:52.534
THERE IS NO YOU AND FABIAN.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.036
DON'T KNOW IF YOU GOT
THE MEMO, JOY,

15:54.119 --> 15:56.246
BUT IT'S BRING
YOUR OWN CLOTHES TO SCHOOL DAY,

15:56.330 --> 15:57.623
NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S.

15:57.706 --> 15:57.956
AMBER.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.753
- HELLO!

16:02.836 --> 16:04.880
OH, WOW, IS THAT--

16:04.963 --> 16:06.674
- AMBER'S DRESS?
YES.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.760
YES, IT IS.

16:09.843 --> 16:10.844
[camera shutter clicks]

16:10.928 --> 16:12.513
WHAT?

16:12.596 --> 16:14.306
- WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.577
- ALFIE?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.204
LOOK.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.124
I COME IN PEACE
BEARING GIFTS.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.297
COME ON.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.465
- WOW!

16:48.549 --> 16:50.551
WATER WOWZA 3,000!

16:50.634 --> 16:54.179
- WELL, YOU KNOW AN ANCIENT
OSIRIAN ZOMBIE WEAPON,

16:54.263 --> 16:56.098
AND YOU KNOW--

16:56.181 --> 16:58.100
YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING
TO KNOW ABOUT ZOMBIES, RIGHT?

16:58.183 --> 16:59.101
YOU CAN ALWAYS
HEAR THEM COMING.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.394
I MEAN, THEY COME
AT YOU LIKE...

17:00.477 --> 17:01.562
[groans]

17:01.645 --> 17:03.689
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

17:03.772 --> 17:05.148
WE'RE GOOD.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.400
[sighs]

17:06.483 --> 17:10.445
SO YOU JUST GOT TO MAKE
A LOT OF NOISE, ALL RIGHT?

17:10.529 --> 17:12.114
THEY HATE NOISE.
- REALLY?

17:12.196 --> 17:13.323
- WELL, SURE.

17:13.406 --> 17:18.162
I MEAN, IT REMINDS THEM
OF WHEN THEY HAD EARS,

17:18.244 --> 17:19.788
BEFORE THEY FELL OFF.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.540
- HEY, THAT'S KIND OF SAD.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.459
- YEAH.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.542
- [shouts]
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.171
HEY, HEY, LOOK,
JUST AIR THROUGH THE VENT,

17:27.253 --> 17:27.796
JUST WIND THROUGH THE VENT.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.964
- YOU CRAZY, MAN?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.592
THERE'S ZOMBIES DOWN THERE!

17:31.675 --> 17:34.178
- YEAH, BUT WE JUST--JUST--

17:38.098 --> 17:40.017
ALL RIGHT.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.191
HEY.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.651
ALL RIGHT, YEAH,
SO ALFIE'S NOT QUITE READY

17:49.735 --> 17:50.694
TO GO BACK IN THE FIELD.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.197
- OKAY.
DO YOU HAVE NINA'S LOCKET?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.323
- YEAH.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.657
- HERE'S HOPING IT WORKS
FOR THE OSIRIAN

17:55.741 --> 17:57.034
AS WELL AS THE CHOSEN ONE.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.076
- YEAH.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.495
- ALL YOU NEED TO DO,
PUT IT HERE.

17:59.578 --> 18:02.164
- OKAY.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.046
[magical whooshing]

18:09.129 --> 18:10.297
[bell ringing]

18:10.380 --> 18:11.965
- YES, YES, I'M COMING.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.342
- WE NEED TO GO NOW.
GET DOWN RIGHT NOW.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.968
- COME ON.
HURRY UP.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.656
[mechanical clacking]

18:35.739 --> 18:39.409
- WHOA, SERIOUSLY?

18:39.493 --> 18:41.286
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME
WITH THIS HOUSE.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.121
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING TO DO

18:43.205 --> 18:45.999
WITH REAWAKEN RITUALS,
ALL RIGHT?

18:46.083 --> 18:48.836
- OKAY.
- LET'S GO.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.392
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
- HUH?

19:03.475 --> 19:05.060
-<i> ANCIENT EGYPTIAN</i>
<i>BOOK OF THE DEAD?</i>

19:05.144 --> 19:07.729
- OKAY, GIVE IT A LOOK,
SEE IF YOU FIND ANYTHING.

19:13.610 --> 19:14.778
-<i> THE CURSE OF ANUBIS.</i>

19:19.074 --> 19:20.659
- HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.831
"ONLY THOSE OF PURE INTENT
MAY WAKE THE SLEEPING MAN,

19:25.914 --> 19:27.791
"FOR IF HE'S AWOKEN BY THOSE
OF IMPURE HEART,

19:27.875 --> 19:31.503
HE'LL BE AWOKEN TO SERVITUDE
TO THE UNDERWORLD."

19:34.923 --> 19:36.550
THIS MEANS HE'S
GOING TO WAKE UP EVIL.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.429
- SWEET AND VICTOR
ARE REALLY ANNOYING,

19:40.512 --> 19:43.098
BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY
IMPURE OF HEART.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.894
- BUT DENBY MIGHT BE,
YOU KNOW, IF SHE'S AN IMPOSTER.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.562
- "AS TO THE CURSE
OF ANUBIS CEREMONY,

19:48.645 --> 19:51.440
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
FOR THIS AUTHOR TO RELATE."

19:51.523 --> 19:53.567
GREAT, SO WHAT WAS THE POINT
IN THIS BOOK?

19:53.650 --> 19:55.152
- GUYS?

19:55.235 --> 19:57.070
WE HAVE COMPANY.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.739
- "LIFE WITHOUT LITERATURE"

19:58.822 --> 20:02.951
CLEARLY REFERS
TO ONE OF FROBISHER'S BOOKS.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.662
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE
IT'S GOING TO BE.

20:05.746 --> 20:06.788
- THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OUT.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.165
- ONLY THROUGH
THE SECRET TUNNEL.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.124
- SECRET TUNNEL?

20:09.207 --> 20:10.375
PERFECT.
LET'S GO.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.336
- PRIVATE STUDY.
MY WORD.

20:12.419 --> 20:15.297
- WE NEED A PROTECTIVE AMULET
TO GET THROUGH.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.673
IT'S BOOBY-TRAPPED.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.135
BIG BEAM OF LIGHT, SHH,
AND THEN EVERYTHING GOES DARK.

20:20.218 --> 20:21.803
- [whispering]
HE'S PUTTING IN THE CODE.

20:25.223 --> 20:26.600
- IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.481
[whispering]
ALFIE?

20:35.817 --> 20:38.570
- [shouts]

20:38.654 --> 20:39.863
- HELLO?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.615
- THE BRATS ARE UP TO SOMETHING.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.783
COME WITH ME.

20:42.866 --> 20:47.162
COME ON, HARRIET!

20:47.245 --> 20:48.664
- THEY'RE GOING.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.666
- WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

20:53.293 --> 20:57.756
- NO ZOMBIE'S GONNA HAVE ME
AS BRAIN CHOW.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.884
[shouting]

21:02.344 --> 21:03.178
- BLAST!

21:03.261 --> 21:06.306
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?

21:06.390 --> 21:08.934
- SHH!

21:09.017 --> 21:10.060
- EDDIE?

21:10.143 --> 21:11.937
- HER BAG.

21:12.020 --> 21:12.771
THE LETTER!

21:12.854 --> 21:13.981
- LETTER?
WHAT LETTER?

21:14.064 --> 21:15.190
EDDIE?

21:15.273 --> 21:17.484
WE'RE KIND OF IN AN ESCAPING
SITUATION HERE.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.819
- THE LETTER.

21:18.902 --> 21:19.861
THERE COULD BE PROOF
OF DENBY BEING AN IMPOSTER.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.947
- GIVE ME THAT!

21:22.030 --> 21:23.532
- OH, MY BAG.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.200
I LEFT MY BAG DOWN THERE.

21:25.283 --> 21:26.493
- EDDIE, COME ON!

21:29.705 --> 21:31.873
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GUESS
WHO DENBY IS.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.668
- YOU WILL GO TO BED
IMMEDIATELY.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.681
THE BRATS HAVE BEEN HERE.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.850
WE CAN FEEL IT.

21:49.933 --> 21:53.186
- MY BAG.
WHERE'S MY BAG?

21:53.270 --> 21:53.937
- PERHAPS THEY THOUGHT
THEY'D GO AND SEARCH

21:54.021 --> 21:56.690
IN ROBERT'S STUDY.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.201
- OH, NO.
BOOBY TRAP.
