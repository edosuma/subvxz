00:00.100 --> 00:02.600
???

00:02.600 --> 00:05.000
Only I want to give you my reasons
for not having sex.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.900
I'm going to be speaking about
that at my TAG group tonight.

00:07.900 --> 00:11.000
Ashley's made a commitment
not to date in high school.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.400
I don't want
to go out with her.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.200
I just want to marry her
and have children with her.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.800
Don't you think Amy's just
going to hate you more

00:15.800 --> 00:18.000
if you make friends
with Ashley?

00:18.400 --> 00:19.500
Yes.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.500
Grace is going to talk about
not having sex.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.100
What will Jack
be talking about?

00:23.200 --> 00:25.000
Everything's not fine
if you're on bed rest.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.200
Everything is fine
as long as I'm on bed rest.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.400
Mom said she wants us
to be there.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.900
- Why?
- She does not want us to have sex.

00:32.901 --> 00:34.456
It's not her decision.

00:34.456 --> 00:35.900
You won't believe
what this guy can do.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.800
George, we don't need a dog.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.400
I'm still thinking about
doing it again.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.500
So are you.
I'm sorry, Jesus.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.600
He might be right.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.900
I want to have sex with guys who could
potentially be a husband for me.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.900
I want to see other people.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.700
Thanks for standing past me
this past year.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.400
Not this past year.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.300
My whole life.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.200
- It's going to be fine.
- Sure it is.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.800
I was thinking you could move in
with Amy, share a bedroom with her,

01:13.800 --> 01:15.400
and we could keep the babies
in the nursery together.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.600
Wow.
Lucky me.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.000
Did you bring home a couple of
bunk beds from the store?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.600
One of those ones with the little desk.
Maybe a slide.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.000
Pumpkin, anything for you.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.200
- How about something
in a nice maple finish?
- Why not?

01:26.200 --> 01:28.600
Amy's going to have the closet full,
so I could bring a matching armoire.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.500
- All right.
- You're serious, aren't you?

01:30.500 --> 01:31.900
Yeah, unfortunately.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.300
You would live
in the same room as Amy?

01:33.300 --> 01:34.800
Where else would I live?
In the nursery?

01:34.800 --> 01:36.800
The nursery was your room.
Amy could put John in her room.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.000
We'll keep the baby
in our room.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.600
If thought that would
keep Mom or Amy

01:39.600 --> 01:41.600
from having another baby,
I would do that.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.600
Frankly, I don't think Amy
wants John back in her room,

01:44.900 --> 01:46.900
and I don't think you or Mom
want a baby in your room,

01:46.900 --> 01:50.300
so that's how it is.

01:50.300 --> 01:52.100
That's the way
it could have gone,

01:52.200 --> 01:53.800
but I got a surprise.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.800
Oh, joy.
Another surprise.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.600
I wasn't just moving things around in
the garage the last couple of weeks.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.700
I reinstalled the urinal,
more as an art piece.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.200
- Why would you do that?
- ???

02:04.000 --> 02:06.600
I made the garage into a room for you.
You want to see it?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.100
You didn't furnish it,
did you?

02:08.100 --> 02:09.699
No, no, no. I'm going
to give you some cash,

02:09.800 --> 02:11.800
and then you can do
whatever you want.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.400
Good morning.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.000
It's not a good morning
unless you get in here and help me.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.300
What are you and Dad
doing anyway?

02:23.400 --> 02:25.100
How much packing
could there be?

02:25.100 --> 02:28.200
Oh, and Mom said she doesn't want
any of that stuff back over here.

02:28.300 --> 02:30.000
Good morning, sunshine.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.200 --> 02:41.600
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.300
For what?

02:43.300 --> 02:44.800
This.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.200
When did this happen?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.300
Past few weekends.
Little something I was working on.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.700
- So now we don't have to live together.
- What?

02:50.700 --> 02:51.900
Dad built this for me.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.100
And for Amy, in that now...

02:54.200 --> 02:56.400
Ashley will not have to share
your room with you.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.100
Your mother and I
thought it would be a good idea.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.300
You and Mom are not
going to let her move in here.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.600
Oh, yes they are.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.200
Why does she get
the big new room?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.900
'Cause your spawn
is in my room.

03:04.900 --> 03:08.300
If anyone's moving in here, it should
be me, because I have a spawn.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.900
I have a baby.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.800
And I need the bigger room.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.700
Ames.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.200
I hope that's the last time
I see her in here.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.800
THE SECRET LIFE OF
THE AMERICAN TEENAGER S02EP11

04:01.800 --> 04:03.600
Hey.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.600
Hi.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.400
Who let you in?

04:07.500 --> 04:10.400
I ran into your mom and Ruben.
They're going to get boxes.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.900
Yeah, I know.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.600
- You could have called.
- I'm waiting for an e-mail.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.000
On your phone?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.300
Yeah, I get e-mail
on my new phone,

04:18.300 --> 04:20.600
so I don't need
to wait around by a computer.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.300
And since I don't need
to wait around by a computer,

04:23.300 --> 04:25.800
I figured I'd drop by
because I thought...

04:25.900 --> 04:29.400
Maybe we could have sex one last time
before you move? One for the road.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.500
Aw, Mr. Sentimental.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.700
We had a lot
of good times in here.

04:33.800 --> 04:34.600
Yeah.

04:34.600 --> 04:37.000
Laying out there,
and on the patio,

04:37.000 --> 04:38.300
and in the parking lot.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.600
And still, you're not
in love with me

04:40.600 --> 04:42.700
and we're never
going to get married,

04:42.900 --> 04:45.000
so I'm never
going to have sex again...

04:45.200 --> 04:46.400
- With you.
- Come on.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.700
You know you want to.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.400
I might want to,
but I'm not going to.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.000
You bought a house
so we could do it

04:51.000 --> 04:52.800
and so I wouldn't be doing it
with anyone else.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.800
Yeah, well,
I still like the house.

04:54.800 --> 04:55.500
I just don't like you.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.800
Come on,
don't hurt my feelings.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.800
You don't have feelings,
do you?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.700
Well, not feelings
for me, anyway.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.000
You know I care about you.
I love you, Adrian.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.400
No, you don't.
You don't love me.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.900
You just tell me you love me
when you're trying to have sex with me.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.400
I know you love me, Adrian.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.900
Yeah, well, I will love again.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.800
Oh, here's your white belt.

05:16.800 --> 05:20.300
And I think this is
your t-shirt, isn't it?

05:20.700 --> 05:21.900
You think?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Look, I don't want to have
any bad mojo between us.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.900
Let's just be friends, okay?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.500
Friends with benefits?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.800
- I'm okay with that.
- Well, I'm not.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.800
I'm going to find
a new beneficiary,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.700
and you should, too.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.000
I'm moving. I'm changing my life.
I'm starting over.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.400
I don't just
want sex anymore.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.300
I want someone to love.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.000
Someone who is the someone.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.300
Someone that I can
marry someday.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.400
Someone that I can
have children with someday.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.500
I think I deserve that.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.200
Okay, would you put down
that phone?

05:58.200 --> 06:02.500
I can't put down my phone. Amy sent me a
shopping list of stuff she needs for John.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.400
This is the e-mail I was waiting for.
That's why I got the phone.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.500
Good, then your next girlfriend
can e-mail you on your phone.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.100
I don't care.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.100
I'm looking for a relationship,

06:12.100 --> 06:15.600
and I'm going to find someone else
who's looking for a relationship.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.800
I deserve to be in a
committed relationship.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.300
You do. You do, Adrian,

06:21.300 --> 06:23.700
but I'm just not going to
marry you or anyone else,

06:23.700 --> 06:26.900
and John is the only baby
I ever want to have with anyone.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.700
Bye, Ricky.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.600
Amy, she's giving up
the whole house, not--

06:48.600 --> 06:49.700
Moving day.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.200
Ashley and George are
moving back into the house,

06:52.200 --> 06:55.700
and George decided to make the
garage into a room for Ashley.

06:56.100 --> 06:56.800
So?

06:56.800 --> 06:59.700
So Amy thought that
she should have the garage.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.500
Hey, did you tell him?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.200
Did he tell you?

07:03.300 --> 07:05.000
No, I didn't tell him.
I didn't get a chance.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.600
Why don't you tell him?

07:07.300 --> 07:09.200
I'm moving in.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.000
Uh, that's great.
Congratulations. Welcome.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.100
Oh, hey, thank you
for saying that.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.800
Even if you don't mean it,
thank you.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.200
No, I mean it.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.500
I love having you here, Betty.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.600
But weren't you
already living here, kind of?

07:26.600 --> 07:29.000
Kind of, but...

07:29.200 --> 07:33.200
now Mr. King says. I can move in
some of my stuff, if I want,

07:33.400 --> 07:34.800
and I want.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.400
- I can't wait to see.
- I can't wait for you to see.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.000
All right, I got to go
meet the movers. Bye.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.300
You want me to come?

07:42.300 --> 07:43.700
No, I can handle it.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.600
- Bye, Ben.
- Bye.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.700
I don't know why I said
she could bring her things.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.800
I do.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.500
Just joking around, Dad.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.900
Well, don't joke around
like that.

07:54.900 --> 07:55.900
I love this woman.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.300
I know.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.200
Question is, do you love her things?

08:01.400 --> 08:02.600
Not that much.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.000
Mom?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.300
Oh, Grace. Hi.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.500
Okay, see you later.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.700
Where you going?

08:13.700 --> 08:15.300
Nowhere. Bye.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.100
- Mom?
- Yes, Grace?

08:17.100 --> 08:18.500
You don't want to tell me
where you're going?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
Oh, nowhere really.
I'll be back.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.900
You're not--

08:22.200 --> 08:23.800
Going on a date
or something, are you?

08:23.800 --> 08:26.500
Grace? No, please.
A date?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.300
Your father hasn't
been dead six months.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.800
Five months, three days
and eleven hours.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.799
Right.
Not six months, even.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.799
I got to run. I told Tom I'd be back
by five, so see you for dinner.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.200
Grace, I'm helping deliver food
to the homeless, okay?

08:41.299 --> 08:43.700
I volunteered. I want to get
out of the house.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.600
Get over here. We've got
seven hours of freedom.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.500
Seven hours of freedom?

08:54.600 --> 08:55.700
Sorry, what?

08:55.700 --> 08:57.900
You and Tammy cannot spend
all day in the house.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.900
Oh, but we can.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.100
No, but you're not going to.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.300
I know what you're up to.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.500
- I know what you're up to.
- What is that?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
The same thing I'm up to.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.300
I am never having sex again.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.200
- What?
- I'm never having sex ever again,

09:13.200 --> 09:14.700
- until I'm married.
- What?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.100
Tom, I said I'm never
having sex ever again,

09:17.100 --> 09:19.200
until I'm married.
And I mean that.

09:19.200 --> 09:23.600
Say it over and over,
'cause no one will believe that.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.700
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.900
- Jack?
- Yeah?

09:38.900 --> 09:43.300
I just found out my mom's out of the house for
the next seven hours feeding homeless people.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.800
Although now might not be
a good time.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.200
So we're doing it again?

09:48.200 --> 09:51.100
I don't know, but maybe today
will be a good day

09:51.100 --> 09:54.200
to just talk about
avoiding temptation.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.100
And we can do that
in the privacy of my bedroom.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.200
Is Tom going to be around?

09:58.200 --> 10:00.400
Yeah, but he'll probably
be in his room with Tammy.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.000
Are you sure
they're not doing it?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.500
They'd better not be.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.000
I'm going to shower
and I'll be right over.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.300
I'll be here.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.800
Oh, and do you have that book
on how to avoid sex?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.700
Yeah, but believe me,
this isn't how.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.200
Bring it anyway.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.400
She was willing to move
into your room with you.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.200
Who said she could
move into my room?

10:21.200 --> 10:23.100
Ashley gave John her room.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.200
You don't have to
give her the garage.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.300
Mom gets a dog,
Ashley gets the entire garage.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.200
What do I get?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.200
Let me see. A new SUV?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.900
I knew it. That's what
this is about. Revenge.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.700
You don't want me to have
a place to park my new car

10:34.700 --> 10:36.600
because you didn't want me
to have that car.

10:36.600 --> 10:38.800
- Revenge, revenge, revenge.
- No, it is not.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.900
The car's in your mother's name,

10:39.900 --> 10:41.100
so the car's between
you and your mother.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.000
I don't care if she gives it to you
or doesn't give it to you.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.700
Whatever she decides
is okay with me.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.400
By the way, the dog
is going back.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.300
- You tell Mom that?
- Not yet, but I'm going to.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.700
She doesn't want a dog,
so we're not keeping the dog.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.500
What makes you think
she doesn't want the dog?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.900
- She said so.
- She said she doesn't want Moose?

10:54.900 --> 10:56.300
Moose is going?

10:56.700 --> 10:58.500
Your mom doesn't want him.
She doesn't want a dog,

10:58.500 --> 11:00.400
so I called the guy
and told him to pick him up.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.000
- Wait, a guy's coming
to pick up Moose?
- Afraid so.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.400
Because you think Mom
doesn't want him.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.600
That's what she said.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
- That won't happen.
- Of course not.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.100
Nothing bad ever happens
in Ashley world.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.700
- Oh, shut up.
- You shut up.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.900
Both of you shut up.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.100
Your mother's having a baby,

11:14.100 --> 11:16.500
and she doesn't want to hear the
two of you arguing, and neither do I.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.100
This is when we all have to
come together as a family.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.100
We're living under one roof
as one family,

11:21.100 --> 11:22.900
so let's start acting
like a family again.

11:22.900 --> 11:25.900
A real family that loves and supports
and respects each other.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.200
You and Mom are not married,

11:27.200 --> 11:29.100
so we're not
a real family anymore.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.500
She has a point.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.000
Do you think you could give me some cash
to go shop for my room?

11:37.100 --> 11:38.400
And could you take me
shopping for my room?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.800
It's a little difficult
to get furniture on my bicycle.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.700
I forgot that we're not
married anymore.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.700
I forgot that your mother
and I are divorced.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.800
It's just a piece of paper,
the divorce and the marriage.

11:46.900 --> 11:50.600
Right, but we're not married legally,
and the baby's coming.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.400
You're not going to have time
to get married before the baby comes.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.600
And she's certainly
not going to marry you

11:55.600 --> 11:57.200
if a guy shows up
to take Moose.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.600
She doesn't want the dog.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.600
It breaks my heart
to give him up,

11:59.600 --> 12:02.800
but I'm going to do whatever your mother
wants, and so are you and so is Amy.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.000
Yes, all right.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.100
Can you take me shopping?

12:05.100 --> 12:06.900
I can't take shopping.
I have to take care of your mother.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.200
By taking her dog?

12:08.200 --> 12:10.900
One more time, she said
she didn't want him.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.300
She doesn't want him.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.100
Well, You're her husband.
You should know.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.200
Oh, wait.
You're not her husband.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.300
Thanks.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.400
What's with all the stuff?

12:35.400 --> 12:40.400
Diapers, food, juice, baby wipes,
lotions, soap, et cetera, et cetera.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.000
I'll get Amy.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.600
That's okay. I can
put this stuff away.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.900
I know where it goes.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.900
What's she in
such a bad mood about?

12:47.900 --> 12:50.400
Are you sure she's in a bad mood?
How can you tell?

12:50.400 --> 12:53.300
Alright, don't say anything bad
about my son's mother, okay?

12:53.400 --> 12:55.800
- If you insist.
- I insist.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.600
My sister's upset
that I got the garage.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.900
- It's my new room.
- Why does she care about that?

13:00.900 --> 13:02.400
I don't know. It's bigger
than her room.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.600
This is why I got sent
on the errand from hell,

13:04.600 --> 13:06.600
because you got
the bigger room?

13:07.700 --> 13:09.500
Sorry, I'm having a bad day.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.600
Maybe you just need
to get out for a while.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.000
I'm supposed to watch John
while Amy's watching your mom.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.400
My dad's watching my mom.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.800
I don't have any place to go.
Really.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.200
I just wasn't excited about bulk
shopping and then coming over here.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.200
I want to look
for furniture for my room.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.500
Maybe some yard sales
or something.

13:24.700 --> 13:26.500
Second-hand stores.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.100
You want to take me?

13:29.300 --> 13:31.100
Yeah, I'll take you.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.400
You want to ask your dad first?

13:33.400 --> 13:35.300
No, I told you,
he's watching my mom.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.700
I'll leave them a note.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.000
I do have these in black.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.000
Oh, boys, over here.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.300
Yeah, I don't think
I'm going to take that.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.600
Why do you have
a dentist chair?

14:07.600 --> 14:09.600
They're very comfortable.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.500
They're the most comfortable
chairs in the world.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.700
When you spend a lot of hours
at the dentist,

14:14.700 --> 14:16.300
you want to be
comfortable, right?

14:16.300 --> 14:18.500
Right. Yeah. I'm going to take
the red heels.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.400
They look as if
they've hardly been worn.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.100
Yeah. I mean, they've hardly
touched the floor.

14:23.900 --> 14:27.700
Oh, Mom, come on.
Let me get the handcuffs. Please?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.800
Sure. Enjoy.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.200
Thank you.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.600
And don't forget
to wear protection.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.700
Why you giving
all this up?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.700
'Cause I'm getting married...

14:45.500 --> 14:47.600
to the Sausage King.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.300
You okay?
I'm fine.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.000
What's wrong?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.700
It's okay. Don't stop.
I'm fine.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.400
Ow, ow. I'm sorry.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.400
I just think
it's that time of the month.

15:14.300 --> 15:17.500
I think I just got
my monthly visitor.

15:18.900 --> 15:21.500
Jack, my Aunt Flo
is in the house.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.100
The painters are here.
I fell off the roof.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.100
Sounds like your vagina's
really busy.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.600
Maybe I should
come back later.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.700
Jack Pappas,
what's wrong with you?

15:29.700 --> 15:32.000
What is wrong with you,
Dr. Grace Bowman?

15:32.100 --> 15:33.900
If you started your period,
you can tell me.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.100
I was being polite.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.800
What does polite
have to do with it?

15:36.800 --> 15:38.300
You don't have to
hide that from me.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.800
It was just me and my mom
in my house growing up.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.900
I used to ride my bike
to pick up tampons.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.100
- Really?
- Really.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.000
Grace, you and I had sex.
We've seen each other naked.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.500
I'm completely comfortable
with bodily functions.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.800
Yours and mine.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.300
I'm completely uncomfortable
with you saying that.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.700
- Why?
- I don't know.

15:54.701 --> 15:59.558
I just feel like I have to hide my
period from you or any other guy.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I mean, I was okay
with my dad knowing about it,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.700
but he was a doctor
and we didn't even talk about it.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.500
That's something we're going to have to
get comfortable with,

16:06.500 --> 16:08.300
you and I,
if we're going to have sex.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.500
We're not having sex
while I'm having my period.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.200
Whatever you're
comfortable with.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.300
I'd be okay with that.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.200
- I'm not.
- All right.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.800
But if you don't mind
getting on your bike

16:18.800 --> 16:20.300
and making a trip
to the drug store,

16:20.300 --> 16:22.800
I do find myself
out of a few things.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.000
Sure.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.900
Just write it down.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.000
Hey.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.200
Where are you going?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.000
I'm just going to the store
to pick something up for Grace.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.500
Yeah, right.
You're going to buy condoms.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.200
Whoa, no, I'm not.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.300
And if I were, that'd be my
business, not yours. Okay, Tom?

16:43.300 --> 16:45.100
Still hurts, huh?

16:49.900 --> 16:51.800
They are doing it.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.500
I know they are.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.700
That doesn't mean anything.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.000
We don't have to do
what they do.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.600
If they ran out and played in traffic,
would you?

17:02.600 --> 17:05.099
Would it feel good?
Yes.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.500
Tom.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.500
I can't help it.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.599
I love you, Tammy.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.500
I want you.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.400
I like it when
you talk like that.

17:16.500 --> 17:20.200
But I like it better
when it's over the phone.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.300
I have to go.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.000
- Call me, Tom.
- Bye.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.200
Hi there.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.200
Oh, Benjamin.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.500
Hey, you just couldn't wait to see
what I was bringing over, huh?

17:42.500 --> 17:45.800
Uh, you've met
Henry and Alice, right?

17:45.800 --> 17:47.300
Hi, little friends.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.800
You have a lot
of fun things here.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.300
- How much are the handcuffs?
- Henry.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.500
I tried to give
those away earlier.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.400
They were given to me
by a friend.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.500
He was a magician.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.400
We didn't really come
to buy anything.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.500
We just came by to see
if you needed any help moving.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.300
You're not taking
the dentist chair?

18:05.400 --> 18:06.700
It's a really cool chair.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.500
- That would look good in Ben's room.
- Henry.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.000
I-- I--

18:10.000 --> 18:12.500
I don't think I have
room for that in my room.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.000
Although it is
a very nice chair, Betty.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.500
It was also given to me
by a friend.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.000
He was a dentist.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.200
Ah! The dentist makes sense.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.200
I am going to keep
the spit basin.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.800
You know, it's that little sink
where you spit in it,

18:28.800 --> 18:31.400
and then the water
takes it around and around.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.900
Yeah, I never had it
hooked up here,

18:32.900 --> 18:36.000
but I'm sure your dad
must know someone.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.500
You know, it looks so cute.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.800
A little sink, next to
the big sink in the bathroom.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.400
Uh, I don't know if that would fall into
our plumber's wheelhouse.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.700
You may have to get a special plumber
who specializes in dentistry.

18:48.700 --> 18:52.100
Oh. Do you think
I should leave it behind?

18:52.100 --> 18:54.100
Yeah, what the heck?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.600
If you weren't using it here.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.600
And it does go
with the chair.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.800
Yeah.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.700
How much is the pogo stick?

19:00.700 --> 19:03.700
- What's that used for?
- Jumping up and down.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.400
Oh, I never thought of that.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.400
You can have it
for a dollar.

19:09.900 --> 19:13.900
Oh, hey. There's that nice boy
you work with. Ricky.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.000
Oh, this is about to get
a whole lot more interesting.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.300
How could it get
more interesting?

19:35.200 --> 19:38.700
Ricky.

19:47.700 --> 19:48.600
How are you?

19:48.600 --> 19:50.600
Why do you keep
asking me that?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.100
I found a home for Moose.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.900
- You did what?
- I found a home for Moose.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.500
There's a long waiting list
for those dogs.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.100
As much as I hate to give him up,
there's another family that wants him.

19:58.300 --> 19:59.500
That's all right.
We can keep him.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.400
We can't. I already called the service.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.300
They're picking him up.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.200
Well, call them back.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.900
I told them my wife is on bed rest
and she doesn't want a dog.

20:05.900 --> 20:06.400
??

20:06.500 --> 20:07.700
Tell them I changed my mind.

20:07.900 --> 20:10.012
They're already on their way over here.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.200
You were right. We're going to have
our three children and our grandson

20:13.200 --> 20:16.000
living in a three-bedroom house
and you're looking after a baby.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.800
Moose understands, don't you, Moose?

20:18.600 --> 20:20.500
No, Moose does not understand.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.900
Moose has already been in two homes,
and this is his third,

20:22.900 --> 20:24.900
and he doesn't want a fourth home.
Do you, Moose?

20:28.400 --> 20:31.700
George, I swear, if you let anyone
take this dog away from me,

20:31.800 --> 20:35.394
you're never moving back
into this house ever again. Ever.

20:35.394 --> 20:36.600
Ashley can sleep in the garage,

20:36.600 --> 20:37.600
but I don't know
where you're going to sleep.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.700
Anne, Moose will be fine. They only
let these dogs into the very best homes.

20:40.800 --> 20:41.800
They let him come here.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.300
This is a very best home.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.400
And it's my home,
and I'm not giving up my dog.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.500
We are ??, because you wanted
to give up our dog.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.600
No, we are not doing anything like that,
because we are not a we.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.000
We may be someday, but we're not right now.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.500
Hey, Moose. How's it going?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.200
Your daughter let me in.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.200
Moose, call 911.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.500
- What's going on?
- She's having a baby. She's nuts.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.300
- Ugh!
- Don't scream. What are you screaming at?

21:25.300 --> 21:27.300
- Ashley and Ricky.
- Ah!

21:27.400 --> 21:29.100
This is all your fault.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.100
You gave her the garage,
so you're responsible if she gets pregnant.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.400
She's not going to get pregnant.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.000
I don't want her out with him,
but she's not going to get pregnant,is she?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.743
He's not answering. That's not a good sign.

21:40.743 --> 21:42.900
- I'll e-mail him.
- Do you think they're at his apartment?

21:42.800 --> 21:45.900
He has mobile e-mail. He doesn't have to be
by his computer to get e-mail.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.400
That's why I made him get that phone.

21:47.600 --> 21:51.500
I'm going to keep e-mailing,
texting and calling him until I find him.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.100
When you find him, I'm going to kill him.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.500
Hi. Do you mind if I put
a few more boxes in the garage?

21:58.600 --> 22:00.400
- Where's your boyfriend?
- Who, Ricky?

22:00.900 --> 22:03.221
Probably out looking
for someone to have sex with.

22:03.221 --> 22:04.200
We broke up.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.600
- Told you so.
- You told him that we broke up?

22:08.600 --> 22:10.700
No, I told him that he's out with Ashley.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.800
He's probably going to get her pregnant, too.

22:12.800 --> 22:15.300
Does anyone in this house
know about birth control?

22:18.600 --> 22:19.300
What's going on?

22:20.300 --> 22:22.200
- Hi, Adrian.
- Yeah, hi.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
All right, everybody out of the room
except Ricky.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.148
Dad, what are you doing?
Ricky was doing me a favor.

22:27.148 --> 22:28.000
What's the matter with you?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.600
Didn't you see the favor
he did for your sister?

22:29.800 --> 22:32.400
And ask me before you go on a date,
especially with him.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.100
A date? No, this wasn't a date.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.200
I'll just be next door.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Neighbors.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.800
Yeah, she'll just be next door,
for the rest of my life.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.300
Thanks, Dad.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.393
Just when I was starting to trust you.

22:50.393 --> 22:51.980
- What did I do?
- You didn't do anything.

22:51.980 --> 22:53.500
Dad, he didn't do anything.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.000
She asked me to take her to a garage sale.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.100
- I took her. So what?
- So what? She's 14.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.400
She's Amy's sister. She's my son's aunt.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.600
I would never go anywhere near her.
I'd never do anything with Ashley.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.100
I do have boundaries. You know?

23:08.200 --> 23:10.700
Do you? Where were your boundaries
last year at band camp?

23:11.000 --> 23:15.400
Wow. Isn't this the pot
calling the kettle black?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.100
Why are you any better than I am?

23:17.100 --> 23:19.200
Why does everyone always think
they're better than I am?

23:19.300 --> 23:21.700
Because apparently,
you never learn from your mistakes.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.642
Don't, okay? Just don't.

23:23.828 --> 23:25.900
I'm trying. I'm really trying.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.794
I've got a job, I'm living on my own,
I'm giving Amy every dime I can give her.

23:29.794 --> 23:32.000
I'm spending all the time I can
here with my son.

23:32.100 --> 23:35.062
And I would never think
about touching Ashley. Never.

23:35.062 --> 23:37.632
I think you would.
I think you would think about it.

23:37.632 --> 23:39.858
- But I wouldn't do it.
- But you would think about it.

23:39.858 --> 23:42.300
Believe me, I'm not the one
you have to worry about.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.000
It's not me. I'm not going there.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.500
But there are plenty of guys
at school who would,

23:46.500 --> 23:49.800
and her hanging out with some guy who's gay
is not going to discourage any of them.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.900
And don't forget,
if she does get in trouble,

23:52.200 --> 23:55.400
it's because you provided
a place for her to get in trouble.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.100
And that's because he trusts me.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.500
Completely.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.200
Don't you, Dad?

24:17.500 --> 24:20.200
Can I help you find your choice
in feminine protection, son?

24:20.400 --> 24:22.600
I've been to three places,
and I can't find these.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.300
Did they take them
off the market or something?

24:24.300 --> 24:26.606
I don't know. I'll check.

24:26.606 --> 24:27.597
I'll be right back.

24:38.700 --> 24:40.100
Is that a lamb or a goat?

24:40.300 --> 24:42.783
It's a lamb. Lambs say baa, right?

24:42.783 --> 24:46.100
I don't know. But you are
definitely the sexiest lamb.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.700
Oh, do you go near lambs often?

24:48.900 --> 24:49.900
I do not.

24:58.000 --> 24:58.900
Do you know him?

25:00.100 --> 25:02.400
Yeah. He's my daughter's boyfriend.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.700
- Oh, no. That's not good.
- No, it's not.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.600
- You're still here.
- Yup, I'm still here.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.900
I didn't do anything wrong,
so there's no reason I wouldn't be here.

25:16.700 --> 25:18.500
I don't think you should be
with Ashley by yourself.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.500
Because I might try to have sex with her?

25:21.300 --> 25:25.100
And of course, if I was so stupid as to try
to do something like try to have sex with her,

25:25.200 --> 25:27.600
of course she'd just give in
because she didn't learn anything

25:27.600 --> 25:28.900
from watching what you've been through.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.500
What was she supposed to learn?

25:30.600 --> 25:32.242
To use birth control?

25:32.300 --> 25:35.200
Maybe she learned to use birth control.
She has condoms.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.300
- For what?
- I don't know.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.400
But I imagine she wants to be prepared
in case she decides to have sex.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.100
- She's too young to have sex.
- I was too young to have sex.

25:44.500 --> 25:48.300
You still had sex with me.
You talked me into having sex.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.900
I didn't talk you into having sex.
We were making out, and we just had sex,

25:52.300 --> 25:53.600
because that's what happened, Amy.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.500
And I thought you were prepared.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.200
I thought if you didn't stop me,
you were on the pill or something.

25:59.200 --> 26:02.600
If I'd planned on taking advantage of you,
I would have had a condom.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.600
But I didn't, because I didn't plan it.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.500
So this isn't all my fault. You know?

26:10.800 --> 26:12.700
Yeah. That's why I'm so angry all the time.

26:14.500 --> 26:17.700
- I'm angry at myself, and you.
- And the world.

26:17.700 --> 26:21.500
- What a stupid, stupid, stupid thing to do.
- Yeah.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.500
But let's make sure
our son doesn't pay for it.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.100
You think I'm taking this out on John?

26:27.100 --> 26:29.357
I think you're a good mother, Amy.

26:29.700 --> 26:31.600
But I think you don't enjoy him.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.700
Well, I'm a little too tired to enjoy him.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.700
Then give yourself a break.
Let me take him, or let me do more.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.900
- I know you broke up with Adrian.
- Yeah.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.400
Well, sooner or later,
I'll get back with Adrian.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.514
And if I don't get back with Adrian,
I'll get with someone else.

26:45.514 --> 26:49.900
So maybe you should realize you can't control
who holds John and who doesn't.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.600
I really hate you.

26:52.700 --> 26:53.700
Do you know that?

26:53.800 --> 26:55.800
Oh, Amy. I know that.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.200
Even when you're nice to me,

27:00.900 --> 27:01.900
I know that.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.400
Oh, hi. You're home.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.400
Hey. Yeah, I've been home
for a couple hours.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.200
You were asleep.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.700
- Cramps.
- Oh. You okay?

27:30.800 --> 27:32.000
I feel a lot better now.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.600
Good. You want something to eat?

27:34.300 --> 27:36.300
I don't know. Maybe, like,
some soup or something.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.800
What'd you and Tom have?

27:38.300 --> 27:42.356
We had hamburgers from Burger Shack.

27:42.356 --> 27:43.400
Delicious.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.900
We brought one for you, too,
but it's probably not that good now.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.000
So if you want soup, I'll make you soup.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.900
Maybe I'll microwave a hamburger.
That sounds really good.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.700
Did you guys get a shake, too?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.400
Yeah, but that's probably
not that good, either.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
You know what, you guys?

27:55.300 --> 27:57.134
Why don't we all just go
and drive through again?

27:57.134 --> 27:58.000
It'll be fun.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.600
You are in a good mood, Mom.

27:59.700 --> 28:02.200
Why are you in a good mood?

28:02.500 --> 28:04.100
Yeah. You are in a good mood.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.500
I don't know. I just-- I am.
I'm in a good mood.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.900
I had a great day.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.900
Next time you go feed the homeless,
I want to come, too.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.200
I like doing that.
It does make everyone feel good.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.000
Yeah. It does.

28:14.100 --> 28:19.300
No. I fed the homeless.
It doesn't make you feel that good.

28:19.700 --> 28:20.500
What's up, Mom?

28:20.700 --> 28:22.500
Nothing. Come on, you guys. Let's go.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.300
I told Jack I'd call him when I got up.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.800
Call him when you get back,
after you've had something to eat.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.400
Okay. I'll get my jacket.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.800
Tom, why don't you go get your jacket too?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.700
All right. I'm not cold, but all right.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.500
All right.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.900
- Hi.
- You didn't say anything to Grace?

28:45.300 --> 28:46.800
- About?
- About--

28:48.400 --> 28:49.300
The drugstore.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.600
- What drugstore?
- Thanks.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.900
- Okay. I'm warm now.
- Good.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.300
I want you to be warm.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.800
Who are you having sex with?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.400
Just kidding.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.700
All right, you guys.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.500
The reason I'm in such a good mood
is because...

29:17.800 --> 29:18.700
I met someone.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
A guy.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.300
And I went with this guy
to feed the homeless.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.800
And then we just hung out for a while.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.600
Good for you. Let's go.

29:32.100 --> 29:33.300
I hate you.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.700
- Adrian.
- Yeah.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.100
<i>Let me in, please.</i>

29:56.600 --> 29:59.000
I'm not going to let you break up with me.
I don't deserve it.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.500
I don't deserve to be with a guy
who's not serious about me.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.700
We're too young to be serious.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.500
We're not that young.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.000
And we've been together for over a year,
and it's going nowhere.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.200
If we know we're never going
to be married, then why be together?

30:14.300 --> 30:15.900
Because we want to be together.

30:16.700 --> 30:18.000
Ow, what are you doing?

30:18.600 --> 30:21.100
I want to have sex,
and I want to have sex with you.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.800
Okay. Calm down, okay.
I don't like you like this.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.600
Like what?

30:25.700 --> 30:28.300
I don't know, something's scaring me.

30:28.300 --> 30:32.600
What? What am I doing that's so scary?
Why are you suddenly afraid to be with me?

30:32.900 --> 30:36.100
Why is Amy's dad suddenly afraid
for me to be around her sister?

30:36.100 --> 30:38.700
I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.600
Okay, okay. It's okay, Ricky, all right?

30:41.600 --> 30:42.800
It's not okay. It's not.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.600
I'm tired of people judging me.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.400
Poor Amy, she's a teenage mother.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.100
Poor Amy, she's got a baby.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.400
Poor Amy, nothing.
I'm a teenage father.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.300
I've got a baby and Amy.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.200
And no matter what I do, no matter
how much I take care of her and my kid,

30:56.200 --> 30:57.300
she still hates me.

30:57.500 --> 31:00.200
And she doesn't give me any credit
for anything, just like you.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.600
You don't give me credit
for being honest with you.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.800
I'm just being honest with you, Adrian.

31:05.300 --> 31:08.600
If I told you I would marry you
when we're older, I'd be lying.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.300
I'd be lying to myself

31:11.000 --> 31:14.400
if I had sex with you right now
and told myself it was okay.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.600
I'd be lying to myself

31:16.900 --> 31:18.800
if I said I was comfortable
having sex with you

31:18.800 --> 31:20.600
just because I'm feeling sorry for you.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.700
Don't feel sorry for me. Forget it.

31:23.100 --> 31:25.100
Wait, wait. Just wait.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.400
I'd like to go to therapy with you.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.500
The two of us.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.200
No.

31:40.700 --> 31:41.700
No.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.000
I think we need to talk to someone.

31:44.600 --> 31:49.000
I need to talk to someone,
but we don't need to talk to my therapist.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.900
- Please.
- No.

31:52.700 --> 31:55.000
Come on, Adrian, I just want to have sex.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.100
I don't think so, Ricky.

31:59.800 --> 32:04.100
I love you, but I don't think so.
It doesn't feel right for me anymore.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.500
That might change, but right now?

32:13.200 --> 32:14.200
No.

32:18.100 --> 32:21.900
Ashley. I'm such an idiot.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.100
Yeah, I agree.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.200
I trust you. I do.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.800
I just got scared, that's all.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.500
Scared I'd have sex,
which means you really don't trust me.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.700
No, Ashley, I do.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.200
- But Ricky, he's--
- He's what?

32:33.500 --> 32:36.000
He's an abused kid who stuck it out,
gone to years of therapy

32:36.000 --> 32:37.900
and tried to make a better life for himself?

32:39.300 --> 32:41.700
He's not a bad guy, Dad.
He's just a guy who's had a bad life.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.800
That's what scares me.
That right there.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.400
I asked him to take me.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.400
I just felt like getting
out of the house for a while.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.300
Look, I'm excited about the new room.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.400
I'm just not excited about being back
in the house it's attached to.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.200
I thought I wanted you and Mom
to get back together,

33:00.200 --> 33:03.900
but that means I have to
get back together with Amy,

33:03.900 --> 33:05.200
and I really don't want to.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.700
You didn't ask Ricky to take you just
to torture Amy, did you?

33:08.200 --> 33:09.100
No.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.100
I would really be upset with you
if you did that.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.700
The thought might have occurred to me
once I was out with him.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.600
But I didn't go out thinking that.

33:16.800 --> 33:17.800
You and Amy should talk.

33:18.100 --> 33:19.800
I don't feel like talking to Amy.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.100
Ashley, I wasn't asking you.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.200
I was telling you.

33:36.900 --> 33:38.400
Look at you.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.700
Isn't that a perfect chair for this room?

33:42.100 --> 33:43.200
It's comfortable, isn't it?

33:43.400 --> 33:44.300
Totally comfortable.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.200
Ben, I just want to give you a hug.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.600
I just want to give you a hug, Betty.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.000
You make my father really happy.

33:52.200 --> 33:56.900
Oh, and I want to thank you for
talking me into leaving that stuff behind.

33:57.300 --> 34:00.700
I was just afraid that if I didn't take
at least some of my stuff,

34:00.700 --> 34:04.700
and it doesn't work out here,
I wouldn't have anything at all.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.100
Even if things don't work out here--

34:06.300 --> 34:09.100
And they will,
I know they will--

34:10.300 --> 34:11.800
You would never leave here with nothing.

34:12.100 --> 34:14.500
- My dad would never let you do that.
- I know.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.505
That's why he gave me a pre-nup.

34:16.505 --> 34:18.699
- Good night.
- Good night.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.900
- Hi. See you in our room.
- I'll be right there.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.199
You're the best.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.100
I saw an opportunity,
and I seized it. That's all.

34:29.100 --> 34:32.300
How often do I get a chance
to do something for my dear old dad?

34:34.100 --> 34:37.900
Why? Why do I get this funny feeling
I'm about to be asked for something?

34:38.300 --> 34:40.900
No, it's nothing.It's just--

34:42.800 --> 34:44.800
Do you think Amy can spend the night here?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.100
We're not going to do anything.

34:46.400 --> 34:50.000
Long as her parents say it's okay,then--
Did her parents say it's okay?

34:50.300 --> 34:52.699
She's just feeling upset about the garage,

34:52.699 --> 34:56.199
and Ashley asked Ricky if he could take her
garage sale shopping,

34:56.199 --> 34:58.400
and it's just been a bad day.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.500
But not because of you?

34:59.600 --> 35:01.300
No, not because of me. Because of Ashley.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.100
Then Amy needs to talk to Ashley.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.100
I mean those two should be spending
the night in a room together, not you two.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.100
You're right.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.600
I was wondering--

35:10.900 --> 35:12.900
Wondering about something more than that?

35:15.900 --> 35:18.526
Do you think that Amy could move in here?

35:18.526 --> 35:22.100
I know that you're happy with Betty here,
and I just thought--

35:22.100 --> 35:22.800
Good night.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.600
So that's a no.

35:25.300 --> 35:26.200
As much as I love you,

35:26.400 --> 35:27.800
and appreciate what you did today,

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
that's a good night.

35:30.900 --> 35:33.000
- Good night, Dad.
- Love you, Ben.

35:33.100 --> 35:34.700
I love you, too. Oh, wait.

35:57.700 --> 36:00.600
<i>Ciao. How are you?</i>

36:20.900 --> 36:22.200
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

36:22.900 --> 36:23.900
It's something.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.800
What are you doing here?

36:24.900 --> 36:28.400
- I need to talk to your dad. Is he here?
- No. He isn't.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.900
???

36:41.500 --> 36:43.700
- Hey. How're you feeling?
- I don't want to talk right now.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.000
I brought you a burger and fries.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.400
Actually, I just brought it up.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.500
Your mom and Tom picked it up.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.700
I'll take it.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.900
How you feeling, Miss Crampy?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.500
My mom is dating.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.500
- Oh.
- Oh?

36:59.400 --> 37:01.300
My mom met my step-dad in grief counseling.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.000
My mom's not going to marry this guy.

37:03.300 --> 37:05.200
- Well, you never know.
- I know.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.100
I know she's never getting married again.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.907
You better take another look at your mom.

37:08.907 --> 37:10.200
She's--

37:12.700 --> 37:14.000
A really nice woman.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.500
Come on now, Grace. She deserves to be happy.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.600
My dad deserves to be happy, but he's dead.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.900
We can't do anything about his happiness,

37:21.000 --> 37:22.800
but we can do something about your mom's.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.000
Are you hoping to ever have sex
with me again at some point?

37:25.400 --> 37:28.200
I knew it. You have been warned.

37:28.600 --> 37:29.900
I'm not warned. I wasn't warned.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.300
I was attacked.

37:31.600 --> 37:32.723
And still, I'm here.

37:32.723 --> 37:34.400
I'm right here,
and I'm not going anywhere.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.651
We'll see about that.

37:36.651 --> 37:42.200
Come on, Grace.
Mom's boyfriend is downstairs.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.500
Let's go get him.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.400
You knew my mom's gigolo was downstairs?

37:46.500 --> 37:47.700
Friend. Her friend.

37:47.800 --> 37:48.700
I don't want to meet him.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.100
I do.

37:56.600 --> 37:57.800
So Jack didn't tell her?

37:58.500 --> 38:01.100
No, no. I told her.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.600
Well, about you. Not bumping into Jack.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.000
And what did you tell her?

38:05.500 --> 38:07.100
Oh, I told her I met a guy.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.500
Kind of a younger guy.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.400
- Go on.
- That's it.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.500
You're leaving out quite a bit
of information there.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.500
I know. I'll tell her
when the time's right.

38:17.500 --> 38:20.000
Tell me, tell me.
The time is right for me.

38:20.100 --> 38:23.000
Hi, Tom. Jeff, this is my son Tom.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.000
You're the boyfriend?

38:24.500 --> 38:26.500
- Friend.
- Or boyfriend.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.600
Whatever you want to call me.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.900
Jeff Sagay. Dr. Sagay.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.400
Dr. Sagay. Didn't you kill my dad?

38:33.800 --> 38:34.700
No, that was my brother.

38:34.700 --> 38:37.900
It was an accident, Tom.
Mechanical failure. You know that.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.800
Jeff and I met at the attorney's office

38:40.800 --> 38:42.600
when the insurance company
was trying to reach a settlement.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.100
I'm really sorry about your dad, Tom.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.900
Yeah. Sorry about your brother.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.700
When Grace finds out about you,
you're next.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.200
Good night.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.700
- I'll see you later, buddy.
- Buddy?

38:56.500 --> 38:57.700
You play football?

38:58.200 --> 39:00.700
Yeah, yeah. I like to throw the ball
around a little bit, sure.

39:00.800 --> 39:01.600
Can't wait.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.500
Got to make a phone call.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.400
I warned you.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.900
- Yeah, well, warn me again.
- Okay.

39:15.900 --> 39:18.800
Uh, you sure about this?

39:19.000 --> 39:19.900
Oh, it's just sex.

39:20.100 --> 39:23.600
Last time I had sex just to have sex,
it got me into a whole lot of trouble.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.400
Yeah, well, you're already
in a whole lot of trouble.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.000
I told my mom about you.

39:32.100 --> 39:36.879
Look. We're both adults,
so if you want to wait--

39:37.290 --> 39:41.700
I know we've talked about this before,
but I'm a Christian, and--

39:41.700 --> 39:44.100
And I'm Jewish. So we'll have a good time.

39:44.100 --> 39:45.400
We'll feel guilty for different reasons.

39:48.500 --> 39:51.200
I can't.
I'm just not ready.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.800
Well, maybe I am ready.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.100
But this isn't the right time.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.300
I need to be a parent tonight.

40:05.300 --> 40:08.500
Your daughter's in her room
with her boyfriend, and Tom's on the phone.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.100
George.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.200
George.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.800
- Moose, call 91--
- No, it's not an emergency.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.500
I'm just hungry.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.700
I'm really, really hungry.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.200
I'm so hungry, I can't sleep.

40:30.500 --> 40:31.500
All right. What do you want?

40:31.800 --> 40:35.700
A big stack of pancakes,
with hot syrup and melted butter.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.200
And not the frozen kind.

40:37.300 --> 40:38.800
I want real ones made from scratch.

40:39.200 --> 40:42.200
And a big, tall glass of cold milk.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.100
Yeah. That's what I want.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.700
- You got it.
- Really?

40:46.900 --> 40:48.500
Really. Anything you want.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.800
For the rest of your life.

40:54.300 --> 40:55.300
Hey, Moose.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.000
We had pancakes the night
the baby was conceived.

40:58.300 --> 40:59.300
Think that means anything?

41:49.200 --> 41:50.000
Hi.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.300
Ricky went home.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.000
He saw you looking at us.

41:54.700 --> 41:55.800
Yeah, I was looking at you.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.700
But I didn't come over there
because I trust you.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.500
Want some pancakes?

42:00.600 --> 42:02.600
- Are those for Mom?
- Yup.

42:02.900 --> 42:04.000
Yeah, I might have one.

42:06.300 --> 42:08.000
So what are you and Ricky talking about?

42:08.200 --> 42:09.100
Lots of stuff.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.300
Please, please, please don't go there.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.000
I have no interest in going there.

42:13.800 --> 42:16.500
I like him as a friend and because
he's the father of Amy's baby.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.700
Don't encourage him to be
more than that, Ash. Please.

42:18.700 --> 42:21.100
Don't encourage him to be
more than the baby's father.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.200
I know he's trying.
I know he wants to be a good guy,

42:23.500 --> 42:25.800
but Amy's been through enough already,
and she's got a good guy.

42:26.000 --> 42:26.900
Yeah, I know.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.300
And besides,
Ricky's not in love with Amy.

42:30.700 --> 42:31.900
He's in love with Adrian.

42:32.100 --> 42:34.600
Well, maybe Adrian can handle him,
but not Amy.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.400
And certainly not you.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.300
No kidding.

42:39.900 --> 42:43.300
Hey, uh, when do you think
you might be coming here?

42:43.900 --> 42:48.300
And by here, do you mean
America or right here?

42:51.500 --> 42:54.400
Oh, yeah. Summer.

42:55.100 --> 42:58.400
Summer would be a much,
much better time to come.
