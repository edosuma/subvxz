<i>Has anyone ever given anything to you?</i>

45:30.022 --> 45:33.525
<i>In all your darkest sorrow</i>

45:35.068 --> 45:38.405
<i>Did you ever just give it back?</i>

45:43.952 --> 45:46.371
<i>Well, I have</i>

45:49.249 --> 45:52.711
<i>I have given that to you</i>

45:54.213 --> 45:57.132
<i>And if that's all</i>

45:57.216 --> 46:00.511
<i>All I ever do</i>

46:02.221 --> 46:08.101
<i>I want you to remember me</i>

46:12.439 --> 46:14.983
<i>Mmm</i>
