WEBVTT

00:09.860 --> 00:12.827
Hold on a second.

00:12.829 --> 00:17.298
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.434
I feel like you're not
hearing me, 'cause if you were,

00:19.436 --> 00:21.636
I wouldn't be repeating myself,
that's why.

00:21.638 --> 00:24.506
No, because I told...look,
I told you three times, okay?

00:24.508 --> 00:27.308
Look...
We'll get going in two.

00:27.310 --> 00:29.444
No, the Nagasaki merger
has to happen at 15.6.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.678
That's black and white.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.347
There's no doubt
about that, okay?

00:32.348 --> 00:33.548
And then you blend
the assets

00:33.550 --> 00:35.784
as I pointed out
in the prospectus, okay?

00:35.786 --> 00:40.055
Trust me, we'll come out of this
smelling like a rose.

00:40.057 --> 00:41.856
You don't trust me?

00:41.858 --> 00:46.628
What am I, a fool?
You...

00:46.630 --> 00:48.163
No, you're not gonna
look like an idiot.

00:48.165 --> 00:50.432
If anyone looks like an idiot,
it's me.

00:50.434 --> 00:52.233
Slap me.
I've been naughty.

00:52.235 --> 00:54.803
Wow, all right.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.604
Now tell me
I'm not gonna get any dessert.

00:56.606 --> 00:57.906
You're not getting
any dessert.

00:57.908 --> 00:59.474
What? Oh!

00:59.476 --> 01:01.609
And you're banned
from TV and Internet for a week!

01:01.611 --> 01:03.711
Yeah.
Ah, yeah.

01:03.713 --> 01:05.880
Tell me I can't watch
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

01:05.882 --> 01:08.183
- What?
- Just tell me!

01:08.185 --> 01:09.184
You're banned
from watching <i> Game of Thrones,</i>

01:09.186 --> 01:10.518
you little shit!

01:10.520 --> 01:12.420
Ah! All right, good,
good, good, good, good.

01:12.422 --> 01:15.023
Yeah, tell me, uh...
run down the whole lineup

01:15.025 --> 01:17.358
of HBO Sunday night shows.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.726
You're banned
from watching <i> Girls.</i>

01:18.728 --> 01:21.162
- No!
- And <i> Veep!</i>

01:21.164 --> 01:24.232
- Ah!
- No more <i> Bored to Death!</i>

01:24.234 --> 01:26.601
Oh!
They canceled <i> Bored to Death.</i>

01:26.603 --> 01:30.738
Oh, um...
no more <i> Boardwalk Empire.</i>

01:30.740 --> 01:31.940
Bullshit!
Ahh!

01:31.942 --> 01:34.075
Ride that shit.
Ride that shit.

01:34.077 --> 01:36.111
Ride that shit
like Evel Knievel.

01:36.113 --> 01:38.646
Ride it.
Oh, God.

01:42.986 --> 01:44.519
Hey, Victoria.
It's Sunday night.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.555
You want to watch
some HBO?

01:47.557 --> 01:49.757
Would you pay me more?

01:49.759 --> 01:52.393
I wasn't planning on it.

01:54.397 --> 01:57.132
No.

02:00.303 --> 02:07.976
¶ ¶

02:07.978 --> 02:14.582

Hey.

04:22.412 --> 04:23.511
I know, man.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.613
Look, I'm just
running a little behind.

04:25.615 --> 04:26.914
I'll be there soon.

04:26.916 --> 04:30.051
I was just saying how
Corinne is a big movie fan.

04:30.053 --> 04:31.386
Yeah, I make it a point

04:31.388 --> 04:34.522
to see all the Oscar-nominated
movies every year.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.658
Well, that's...that's great.

04:36.660 --> 04:38.526
Do you have any, uh,
any favorites or...

04:38.528 --> 04:41.863
Let's see, um,
well, I'm gonna have

04:41.865 --> 04:44.165
to break it down
genre by genre.

04:44.167 --> 04:47.468
Family, uh,<i> Up</i> is
a really good family film.

04:47.470 --> 04:48.670
- So good.
- Beautiful movie.

04:48.672 --> 04:49.937
I cried.

04:49.939 --> 04:51.306
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. I cried.

04:51.308 --> 04:52.974
Within, like, the first minute.

04:52.976 --> 04:54.208
- You both cried.
- Did you?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.010
If I had to pick
my favorite action,

04:56.012 --> 04:57.478
it'd be <i> Saving Private Ryan.</i>

04:57.480 --> 04:59.113
- Classic.
- It's so visceral.

04:59.115 --> 05:01.582
A lot of guys like action films,
but I do too.

05:01.584 --> 05:03.685
Mitch, you love
<i>Saving Private Ryan.</i>

05:03.687 --> 05:04.986
- He does?
- Yeah.

05:04.988 --> 05:06.521
Wow, a lot of things
in common.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.222
Yeah, I think we've watched
it together, maybe.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.091
I just think
it's really disappointing how

05:10.093 --> 05:12.927
in so many movies
they use sex

05:12.929 --> 05:15.029
in such a gratuitous fashion.

05:15.031 --> 05:16.631
It's really,
really tasteless.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.566
You know,
I couldn't agree more.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.968
And the film industry
thinks we want to see tits

05:20.970 --> 05:22.503
in every other scene
to be satisfied.

05:22.505 --> 05:24.372
It's ridiculous.
Am I right? Thank you.

05:24.374 --> 05:27.075
Okay, well, that's one point
we don't agree on.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.109
- Love your...
- Just the one.

05:28.111 --> 05:29.944
Well, yeah.

05:29.946 --> 05:31.245
You know, I'm gonna run
to the bathroom.

05:31.247 --> 05:34.182
I'm gonna...I'll be right back.

05:56.906 --> 05:58.272
How are you doing tonight?

05:58.274 --> 05:59.741
Good, good, thank you.

05:59.743 --> 06:00.875
Yourself?

06:00.877 --> 06:03.044
- Oh, I'm doing great.
- What the fuck, man?

06:03.046 --> 06:04.812
Excuse me.

06:04.814 --> 06:07.382
You're looking at Corinne
like she's some kind of leper.

06:07.384 --> 06:08.816
I'm not looking
to get set up, okay?

06:08.818 --> 06:10.385
You insisted.
It's the only reason I'm here.

06:10.387 --> 06:11.886
Yeah,
you're in the goddamn bathroom.

06:11.888 --> 06:13.654
Hey, hey, hey,
what's wrong with the bathroom?

06:13.656 --> 06:15.490
He didn't mean anything by it.
I'm sorry, he was just...

06:15.492 --> 06:17.291
You got to get
your shit together, man.

06:17.293 --> 06:18.926
You can't keep living like this.

06:18.928 --> 06:21.496
How's he living?

06:21.498 --> 06:22.663
Yeah, how am I living?

06:22.665 --> 06:24.599
- You've got real issues.
- Like what?

06:24.601 --> 06:26.134
Like having to get up
in the middle of dinner

06:26.136 --> 06:28.069
and come in here
and rub one out.

06:28.071 --> 06:29.871
I knew that.
Yup, that's what I thought.

06:29.873 --> 06:32.306
JP, I'm trying here, man.
I just...I don't want to be here.

06:32.308 --> 06:33.508
You're on the app again,
aren't you?

06:33.510 --> 06:34.843
What app?

06:34.844 --> 06:36.177
You know what the fuck app
I'm talking about, the sex app.

06:36.179 --> 06:37.478
- Sir, sir, please keep...
- God damn it!

06:37.480 --> 06:40.014
You are so fucking intrusive
for a bathroom attendant.

06:40.016 --> 06:41.316
I just...
is there a sex app?

06:41.317 --> 06:42.617
Well, I mean, yeah,
it just kind of connects you

06:42.619 --> 06:44.352
with other people looking
to get it in, in your vicinity.

06:44.354 --> 06:45.686
Heard about this, heard...yeah,
my cousin told me about this.

06:45.688 --> 06:47.455
- Oh, man, I got to get on that.
- What the fuck?

06:47.457 --> 06:49.357
- You'd clean up. You should.
- Think so?

06:49.359 --> 06:51.692
In fact, I actually just made
a connection, so I'm gonna go.

06:51.694 --> 06:53.027
- There we go.
- No, no, no, no, no.

06:53.029 --> 06:55.363
Do not bail out on me.
You cannot do this to me.

06:55.365 --> 06:56.864
Look, it's...
tell her I'm not feeling well.

06:56.866 --> 06:58.533
If you want to go with IBS,
I'm fine with that, all right?

06:58.535 --> 07:02.170
- Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.
- I'm sorry, man.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.372
Shit, w-which app is it?
Is it this one? Which...

07:04.374 --> 07:06.040
- What was the name of the app?
- I don't know, man.

07:06.042 --> 07:07.383
Could you give me
one of those little...

07:07.384 --> 07:08.725
- I think this is probably it.
- Are those eye drops or mints?

07:08.726 --> 07:10.067
Oh, these are mints
and eye drops. I have both, man.

07:10.068 --> 07:11.409
- Whatever you need, please.
- Just give me one of each.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.448
This is sort of a weird thing
to say.

07:13.450 --> 07:14.599
Okay.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.749
But I feel like
I can imagine

07:15.752 --> 07:18.719
what our baby
would look like.

07:18.721 --> 07:22.323
Oh, wow.
That's amazing.

07:22.325 --> 07:24.859
- They would be really cute.
- Really good-looking.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.695
- Yeah.
- And smart.

07:29.833 --> 07:32.099
Where's Mitch?

07:32.101 --> 07:34.769
Um, are you familiar
with IBS?

07:54.457 --> 08:02.463
¶ ¶

08:09.439 --> 08:17.445
¶ ¶

08:34.464 --> 08:42.470
¶ ¶

09:05.328 --> 09:08.863
Sure, you can buy me
a drink.

09:08.865 --> 09:11.299
Good to know.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.534
Is that how you treat
a lady who shows interest?

09:13.536 --> 09:15.736
You asked for a free drink.
You didn't show interest.

09:15.738 --> 09:18.205
Were you expecting a blow job
right out of the gate?

09:18.207 --> 09:20.207
Offering something
would indicate more interest

09:20.209 --> 09:21.742
than asking for something, so...

09:21.744 --> 09:24.679
You don't want to get
to know each other first?

09:24.681 --> 09:29.317
Before I buy you a drink
or before the blow job?

09:29.319 --> 09:33.487
Fine, I'll start.

09:33.489 --> 09:34.855
My name is Victoria,

09:34.857 --> 09:37.258
and I moved here
two years ago

09:37.260 --> 09:39.493
after I graduated
from Stanford.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.196
I'm currently reading
a book on Gandhi.

09:42.198 --> 09:44.031
I continue to sleep
on my stomach,

09:44.033 --> 09:45.566
no matter how many times
my chiropractor

09:45.568 --> 09:46.567
tells me not to.

09:46.569 --> 09:47.868
You shouldn't do that.

09:47.870 --> 09:50.071
And I call bullshit
on anyone

09:50.073 --> 09:53.374
suddenly becoming allergic to
gluten in the last five years.

09:53.376 --> 09:56.611
Liars.

09:56.613 --> 09:59.814
You must be MsJuicy34.

09:59.816 --> 10:00.948
What?

10:00.950 --> 10:04.785
From the, uh,
sex app, Climax.

10:07.256 --> 10:12.360
So you're not here
to have sex with me?

10:12.362 --> 10:15.463
Uh, I don't know
what you're talking about,

10:15.465 --> 10:19.467
but, um...
it's 1,000 for the hour,

10:19.469 --> 10:21.702
3,000 for the night.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.907
You're a hooker.
I didn't peg you.

10:26.909 --> 10:29.477
I'm an escort.

10:29.479 --> 10:33.114
Yeah, you escort men's penises
inside you for money.

10:33.116 --> 10:35.650
Fuck you.

10:35.652 --> 10:37.918
Look, you're barking
up the wrong tree, all right?

10:37.920 --> 10:39.153
I couldn't afford you anyway.

10:39.155 --> 10:41.122
Well, then maybe dress
in your tax bracket

10:41.124 --> 10:42.423
and don't come
to swanky hotels.

10:42.425 --> 10:44.558
For your information,
this is all H&M,

10:44.560 --> 10:45.793
and I'm here
to meet a girl.

10:45.795 --> 10:48.062
Yeah, from a sex app,
pervert.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.664
Pervert?
You're the hooker.

10:49.666 --> 10:50.965
Escort.

10:50.967 --> 10:53.934
Is your name even Victoria?

10:53.936 --> 10:55.836
What do you think?

10:55.838 --> 10:57.138
For what it's worth,

10:57.140 --> 10:58.839
everything else I told you
was true.

10:58.841 --> 11:01.709
Yeah, even the Stanford thing?

11:01.711 --> 11:03.711
Everything.

11:20.630 --> 11:22.129
All right.

11:27.970 --> 11:30.237
How are you?

11:32.241 --> 11:33.274
Fine.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.042
I need the obituary
for Dr. Filler

11:35.044 --> 11:36.210
and Elaine Ackerton.

11:36.212 --> 11:38.279
Yeah, got that right here.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.582
Um, Filler, Ackerton.

11:41.584 --> 11:43.117
There you go.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.319
I can always count
on you, Mitch.

11:45.321 --> 11:48.055
And hey, can you stop
by my office in about ten?

11:48.057 --> 11:49.356
I want to run
something by you.

11:49.358 --> 11:51.092
Yeah, sure. Is it
about getting new computers?

11:51.094 --> 11:54.028
Because I think
that would really...

11:54.030 --> 11:55.463
boost morale.

11:56.866 --> 12:00.601
There is no easy way
to say this,

12:00.603 --> 12:04.271
but you know
how you're currently

12:04.273 --> 12:05.806
an employee of the company?

12:05.808 --> 12:09.710
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah, I do.

12:09.712 --> 12:13.114
You're not going to be
when you leave this office.

12:14.884 --> 12:20.521
Um, but you just said
everything was all right.

12:20.523 --> 12:22.056
Interesting. No.

12:22.058 --> 12:23.724
I just needed you
to come to my office,

12:23.726 --> 12:26.727
and I didn't want you to think
I was firing you.

12:26.729 --> 12:28.529
But I'm the best journalist
you have on the team.

12:28.531 --> 12:30.331
You even said
to me last week,

12:30.333 --> 12:32.066
"Mitch, you're the best
journalist we have on the team,"

12:32.068 --> 12:33.200
so I'm just a little confused
as to...

12:33.202 --> 12:34.635
If it makes you feel
any better,

12:34.637 --> 12:38.706
this decision had nothing to do
with merit.

12:38.708 --> 12:42.643
Uh, then...then...then what?

12:42.645 --> 12:46.580
If I let Patty go,
here comes the ageism lawsuit.

12:48.785 --> 12:51.252
If I fire Darnell...

12:53.055 --> 12:57.158
Well, you can connect the dots.

12:57.160 --> 13:01.662
And I was very clear
about not fucking the interns.

13:03.266 --> 13:11.272
¶ ¶

13:40.937 --> 13:49.143
¶ ¶

14:07.563 --> 14:09.563
You know, that guy
is a slimy fucking bastard.

14:09.565 --> 14:12.967
He's lucky
I don't rip his head off.

14:12.969 --> 14:15.603
Told him not to act like a big
swinging dick with you around,

14:15.605 --> 14:17.171
or you'd shove it
right back up his ass.

14:17.173 --> 14:18.572
Yeah, right.

14:18.574 --> 14:21.008
Hey, Don, you've met
my cousin Mitch, right?

14:21.010 --> 14:23.177
- The sex addict dude?
- Yup.

14:23.179 --> 14:25.479
Just taking a little survey.

14:25.481 --> 14:27.915
- Well, have fun with that.
- Thanks, bud.

14:27.917 --> 14:30.117
I'll talk to you soon.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.919
That how you like being known?

14:31.921 --> 14:33.053
The only reason
that's my rep

14:33.055 --> 14:34.321
is 'cause you
tell people that.

14:34.323 --> 14:35.422
How do you think
small talk works?

14:35.424 --> 14:36.590
When there's an awkward silence,

14:36.592 --> 14:37.892
what else do you expect me
to say?

14:37.894 --> 14:39.026
Like, anything else.

14:39.028 --> 14:40.327
Seriously, anything else.

14:40.329 --> 14:41.762
You know, I used to think
any guy would be

14:41.764 --> 14:43.397
a sex addict if he could,
and now that I know one,

14:43.399 --> 14:45.499
it's...it's real,
and it is scary.

14:45.501 --> 14:47.234
Look,
are we getting lunch or what?

14:47.236 --> 14:50.337
I'm just saying, Mitch,
you're 27 years old.

14:50.339 --> 14:53.173
You're unemployed,
no money, no girlfriend.

14:53.175 --> 14:54.675
You don't talk
to anyone anymore.

14:54.677 --> 14:56.443
I'm talking to you
right now, aren't I?

14:56.445 --> 14:58.846
There are 20 billion people
in the world.

14:58.848 --> 15:00.781
I don't think that's true.

15:00.783 --> 15:02.449
Mitch, I'm your only friend.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.385
Do you know how much pressure
that puts me under?

15:04.387 --> 15:06.387
Look, man, I don't get
on your ass for going

15:06.389 --> 15:08.455
to all those dubstep concerts
you're way too old for.

15:08.457 --> 15:10.824
I'm right in the middle
of the demographic!

15:10.826 --> 15:12.293
Okay, what you did to me
and Allie

15:12.295 --> 15:13.961
the other night
really made us look bad,

15:13.963 --> 15:15.129
and the Mitch I used to know

15:15.131 --> 15:16.597
would never have bailed
like that.

15:16.599 --> 15:18.065
Clearly, you've got
something going on.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.366
If you're not
working right now,

15:19.368 --> 15:20.968
maybe it's time
to get some help.

15:20.970 --> 15:22.870
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.

15:22.872 --> 15:24.972
- You said, "Let's get lunch."
- Why do you keep putting?

15:24.974 --> 15:26.373
Because you kept
putting on your tie.

15:26.375 --> 15:31.045
¶ ¶

15:31.047 --> 15:33.948
I'm sure I don't have
to tell you how tough it is

15:33.950 --> 15:36.483
in the newspaper business
right now.

15:36.485 --> 15:41.322
Our only hope is if something
should happen to the Internet,

15:41.324 --> 15:44.925
something like, say,
a solar flare event

15:44.927 --> 15:47.661
that knocks out
all the electricity,

15:47.663 --> 15:50.497
then we'd be in business.

15:50.499 --> 15:52.433
We can only hope.

15:52.435 --> 15:54.635
So is there,
like, a job opening?

15:54.637 --> 15:56.670
Nothing.

15:56.672 --> 15:58.739
Our numbers are tight as is.

15:58.741 --> 16:00.574
Unless you could work for free,

16:00.576 --> 16:04.144
I don't really see
how we would make it work.

16:04.146 --> 16:07.247
You won't work for free,
will you?

16:09.919 --> 16:11.418
No.

16:30.706 --> 16:32.539
Um, this is <i> Mission Magazine.</i>

16:32.541 --> 16:35.242
We don't cover obituaries
and local interest.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.444
Right, well, sure,
I covered obituaries,

16:37.446 --> 16:39.346
but I also wrote features
for other sections as well.

16:39.348 --> 16:40.781
They're...they're on there.

16:40.783 --> 16:44.118
"Finding the right
gastroenterologist for you"?

16:44.120 --> 16:45.753
Believe it or not,
a reader wrote in

16:45.755 --> 16:48.222
actually saying how that article
saved her life, so, I mean,

16:48.224 --> 16:50.124
I kind of feel good
about that one.

16:50.126 --> 16:51.825
You know what,
thank you for coming in,

16:51.827 --> 16:54.194
but I just don't think I see
anything here that indicates

16:54.196 --> 16:56.897
your sensibilities
would resonate with our readers.

16:56.899 --> 16:58.532
But thanks.

16:58.534 --> 17:01.468
Well, thanks.
Thanks for your time.

17:06.142 --> 17:07.574
You know what?

17:07.576 --> 17:08.976
Just give me a shot.

17:08.978 --> 17:10.310
I'll write something on spec,

17:10.311 --> 17:13.747
something your audience
would actually read.

17:13.749 --> 17:16.983
What do you have to lose?

17:18.820 --> 17:20.319
I have an open position,

17:20.321 --> 17:22.222
but I've got two writers
writing something for it,

17:22.223 --> 17:25.125
so I can throw you into the mix,
but you are going to need

17:25.127 --> 17:27.094
to write something
that I can actually print.

17:27.096 --> 17:30.798
I can't publish "What Using
the Semicolon Says about You."

17:30.800 --> 17:32.566
Yeah, no...no more semicolons.

17:32.568 --> 17:35.702
We're gonna...we're gonna write
something interesting here.

17:35.704 --> 17:36.937
Uh, should I leave this here?

17:36.939 --> 17:39.239
No, I think I've seen enough.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.046
Why you make me
track you down like a criminal?

17:46.048 --> 17:47.414
Junior, hey, you know,

17:47.416 --> 17:48.715
I was just about
to stop by your apartment.

17:48.717 --> 17:49.983
You stop nowhere.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.618
Rent is due by the end
of this week,

17:51.620 --> 17:53.220
and you still haven't paid me
in full for last month.

17:53.222 --> 17:55.022
And I was just about to...

17:55.024 --> 17:57.491
Look, I'm not gonna play this
game with you no more,<i> cabrón.</i>

17:57.493 --> 18:00.694
You pay the rent by Friday,
or I'll evict you,

18:00.696 --> 18:04.665
and I'll take whatever stuff
you have in there

18:04.667 --> 18:06.533
that looks...

18:06.535 --> 18:09.903
nice to me.

18:09.905 --> 18:11.638
That's expensive stuff.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.907
If you can afford milk
of coconuts

18:13.909 --> 18:15.976
like some prince,

18:15.978 --> 18:18.612
you can afford
to pay the rent.

18:20.816 --> 18:23.183
Should I assume I'm not gonna
see that back, or...

18:23.185 --> 18:25.419
It's yours, yup.

18:36.265 --> 18:46.340
¶ ¶

18:52.414 --> 18:55.048
¶ ¶

18:55.050 --> 18:56.817
Hey, man, do you happen
to know a regular here

18:56.819 --> 18:57.751
by the name of Victoria?

18:57.753 --> 18:58.886
She comes around a lot.

18:58.888 --> 18:59.953
You a cop?

18:59.955 --> 19:01.455
Do I look like a cop?

19:01.457 --> 19:03.290
'Cause if you're a cop,
you got to tell me.

19:03.292 --> 19:04.758
I mean, I don't...
I don't think that's true,

19:04.760 --> 19:06.393
but, no, I'm not a cop.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.961
Prove it.

19:07.963 --> 19:09.229
I mean,
I just said I'm not a cop.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.297
I don't know what more I can do.

19:10.299 --> 19:12.065
You know, certain women,

19:12.067 --> 19:14.434
they have their clients
take out their junk

19:14.436 --> 19:17.037
just to prove
that they're not a cop.

19:17.039 --> 19:18.872
So why don't you
show me a ball?

19:18.874 --> 19:20.107
That should do it.

19:20.109 --> 19:21.308
I'm not gonna take
my balls out

19:21.310 --> 19:22.809
in the middle of the bar,
man.

19:22.811 --> 19:24.878
I said one ball.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.246
Look, this is getting weird.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.514
I just...can you just tell me
if Victoria...

19:27.516 --> 19:31.185
- Forget it, pig.
- Yeah, fuck this.

19:31.187 --> 19:33.053
You're not gonna
pay for this?

19:43.599 --> 19:45.299
Victoria?

19:45.301 --> 19:47.501
Or whatever your real name is.

19:47.503 --> 19:49.503
Oh, God, are you, like,
one of those guys

19:49.505 --> 19:51.238
that's seen <i> Pretty Woman</i>
too many times?

19:51.240 --> 19:53.574
I've never seen <i> Pretty Woman.</i>

19:53.576 --> 19:55.242
I don't believe you.

19:55.244 --> 19:57.010
Of course
I've seen <i> Pretty Woman.</i>

19:57.012 --> 19:58.245
Who hasn't seen
<i>Pretty Woman?</i>

19:58.247 --> 19:59.246
It's Gere and Roberts
at their finest.

19:59.248 --> 20:00.480
It's a great movie.

20:00.482 --> 20:03.517
Wait, I just have to ask
you something.

20:03.519 --> 20:05.319
Look, I'm not
trying to save you

20:05.321 --> 20:06.820
or sleep with you,
for that matter.

20:06.822 --> 20:07.921
Oh.

20:07.923 --> 20:09.223
All I want to do
is write a story,

20:09.225 --> 20:10.424
an interesting one,
and I think you have that.

20:10.426 --> 20:11.858
Well, that's great,
so my family

20:11.860 --> 20:13.193
can find out
I'm an escort

20:13.195 --> 20:14.461
on some idiot's Tumblr.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.230
No, no, no, look,
it's not for a blog.

20:16.232 --> 20:18.165
It's for, like,
a legit magazine.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.534
Well, let me see a card.

20:20.536 --> 20:22.936
Well, I don't technically
work for them yet.

20:22.938 --> 20:25.505
- This is my application piece.
- You're full of shit.

20:25.507 --> 20:28.208
Usual...vodka, rocks,
two limes.

20:28.210 --> 20:29.476
You know this guy's a cop?

20:29.478 --> 20:31.144
- Oh, my God.
- You're a cop?

20:31.146 --> 20:33.046
- I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, he was in here earlier.

20:33.048 --> 20:34.147
He wouldn't show his nuts.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.583
- That's a tell.
- What?

20:36.585 --> 20:37.884
How is that a tell?

20:37.886 --> 20:40.053
- 'Cause you didn't do it.
- You know...

20:40.055 --> 20:41.822
Just...just get the lady
her drink, please.

20:41.824 --> 20:45.926
Look, I know you have to have
your guard up doing what you do,

20:45.928 --> 20:50.264
but I'm a decent guy,
I swear.

20:50.266 --> 20:55.168
I just lost my job
working at this newspaper,

20:55.170 --> 20:57.938
and I'm trying to land
this gig at this magazine.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.973
All I want to do is tell
an interesting story,

20:59.975 --> 21:01.975
and I think you have one.

21:01.977 --> 21:03.710
Yeah?

21:03.712 --> 21:06.013
What story would that be?

21:06.015 --> 21:11.585
You know, you're
a Stanford-educated, uh...

21:11.587 --> 21:14.254
- Escort. Yeah.
- Sure.

21:14.256 --> 21:15.856
We...we can take
that angle if you want.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.157
All right, buddy, look.

21:17.159 --> 21:18.425
I'm not interested
in being your hooker

21:18.427 --> 21:20.360
with a heart of gold
or being some pity piece

21:20.362 --> 21:21.762
about how the system
failed me

21:21.764 --> 21:23.664
or whatever bullshit angle
you're taking.

21:23.666 --> 21:25.832
Look, I'm not out
to make you look bad.

21:25.834 --> 21:26.833
Just let me follow you
around for,

21:26.835 --> 21:28.035
like, a week or two.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.069
You won't even
notice I'm there.

21:29.071 --> 21:31.071
No.
Final answer, sorry.

21:31.073 --> 21:33.006
Wait, just...here, just...

21:33.008 --> 21:34.408
You asked for a card
the other day.

21:34.410 --> 21:37.678
Take that in case
you change your mind.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.547
Think about it.

21:43.085 --> 21:44.985
You fucked that one up, huh?

21:44.987 --> 21:53.193
¶ ¶

22:03.839 --> 22:05.605
I'm so into you, baby.

22:05.607 --> 22:07.474
I'm getting wet just thinking
about what you're gonna do.

22:07.476 --> 22:09.142
Fuck, come here.

22:09.144 --> 22:10.777
Ah.
Oh, jeez.

22:10.779 --> 22:12.212
Hey, hey,
I said no kissing.

22:12.214 --> 22:14.147
- I'm not gonna say it again.
- Come on, baby.

22:14.149 --> 22:16.016
I can be your boyfriend.

22:16.018 --> 22:18.185
Oh, come on.

22:18.187 --> 22:21.021
Stop it.
It's over, asshole.

22:21.023 --> 22:24.091
Don't be such a goddamn bitch.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.360
No, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

22:26.362 --> 22:29.329
I'm getting what I paid for.

22:29.331 --> 22:32.432
Shh, shh, shh.

22:35.170 --> 22:38.038
I'll kill you,
you fucking whore!

22:40.542 --> 22:48.548
¶ ¶

22:53.055 --> 22:55.088
Dad. Hey.

22:55.090 --> 22:59.159
Um, I need a bit of a favor.

23:05.567 --> 23:08.101
Babe, I swear to God,
I can't fucking do this anymore.

23:08.103 --> 23:09.636
Why, what happened?

23:09.638 --> 23:15.575
Oh, I'm fine, I'm just,
like, a little bit rattled.

23:15.577 --> 23:17.677
Fucking scumbag.

23:17.679 --> 23:21.281
What, he try to stick it
in that beautiful ass again?

23:21.283 --> 23:24.918
No, he's just a...

23:24.920 --> 23:28.388
just drunk, coked-out bullshit.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.359
Still think my ass is beautiful?

23:33.962 --> 23:35.695
It's a dangerous world
out there.

23:35.697 --> 23:38.031
You ever think about getting
back with Sebastian?

23:38.033 --> 23:40.100
Hell, no.
I...I don't want a pimp.

23:40.102 --> 23:42.869
It makes it feel way too real.

23:42.871 --> 23:44.704
Plus, that fucker
took half my money,

23:44.706 --> 23:46.273
and I did all the work.

23:46.275 --> 23:48.008
Well, what happened tonight
would not happen

23:48.010 --> 23:49.709
if you had someone there
with you.

23:49.711 --> 23:52.546
That's all I'm saying.

23:52.548 --> 23:54.481
Yeah.

23:54.483 --> 23:57.050
Maybe.

24:00.289 --> 24:08.295
¶ ¶

24:18.073 --> 24:20.340
Hey, you find
a parking spot okay?

24:20.342 --> 24:23.143
I actually walked here.
I don't have a car.

24:23.145 --> 24:24.578
You don't have
a car in LA?

24:24.580 --> 24:29.816
Yeah, or any other city.
I don't have a car.

24:29.818 --> 24:31.351
Speaking of, nice one.

24:31.353 --> 24:34.020
- I like it.
- Thanks.

24:34.022 --> 24:36.823
Is that, like,
an environmental issue or...

24:36.825 --> 24:39.259
No, my life's just pretty
contained to this area,

24:39.261 --> 24:42.095
so I don't need a car.

24:48.203 --> 24:51.071
- So what made you come around?
- Does it matter?

24:51.073 --> 24:52.606
You seemed really desperate
and pathetic.

24:52.608 --> 24:54.841
Just be glad
I'm letting you do this.

24:54.843 --> 24:58.945
Oh. A charity case.
I'll take it.

24:58.947 --> 25:00.413
So are you
from around here or...

25:00.415 --> 25:02.816
Shouldn't you have something
to write this down with?

25:02.818 --> 25:04.150
No, I just prefer
to listen.

25:04.152 --> 25:06.019
Oh, God, are you, like,
one of those waiters

25:06.021 --> 25:07.287
who doesn't write
anything down

25:07.289 --> 25:09.456
and then fucks
the order all up?

25:09.458 --> 25:11.658
Uh, no, I'm like
one of those waiters

25:11.660 --> 25:14.194
who doesn't write anything down
and gets it all right.

25:14.196 --> 25:16.596
By the way, no names,
places, pictures,

25:16.598 --> 25:18.098
nothing that can tie me
to this article,

25:18.100 --> 25:19.399
or I will rip
your balls off.

25:19.401 --> 25:21.401
I don't even know
your real name.

25:21.403 --> 25:24.204
- Where are we going, anyway?
- I have an 11:00.

25:24.206 --> 25:26.640
In the morning?

25:30.546 --> 25:32.279
Hey, Ruth,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

25:32.281 --> 25:34.080
Oh, no problem, Natalie.
Jared's waiting in the kitchen.

25:34.082 --> 25:35.582
- Okay.
- Did you hear that, Natalie?

25:35.584 --> 25:37.617
Jared's waiting
in the kitchen, Natalie.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.886
- And who's this?
- Oh, hi, I'm Mitch.

25:39.888 --> 25:41.288
A friend from out of town.

25:41.290 --> 25:43.657
He has nothing to do today
because he has no friends.

25:43.659 --> 25:46.092
Also, he's a little slow.

25:46.094 --> 25:48.161
Do you mind if he hangs out here
for the hour?

25:48.163 --> 25:50.630
Oh, bless his heart.
Of course, come in.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.966
Thanks.
Hey, this is weird.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.669
- Who's Jared?
- Her ten-year-old son.

25:55.671 --> 25:57.437
She's paying you to have sex
with her ten-year-old son?

25:57.439 --> 25:58.505
This is...you know what?
I can't do this.

25:58.507 --> 25:59.940
Shut up.
Pretend you don't exist.

25:59.942 --> 26:00.941
I thought I could do it.
I can't.

26:00.943 --> 26:03.276
And shut the door.

26:03.278 --> 26:06.613
For the record,
I'm not comfortable with this.

26:06.615 --> 26:08.782
¶ ¶

26:08.784 --> 26:11.585
Great, so what do all
these equations have in common?

26:18.627 --> 26:20.026
So why do you tutor
when you're pulling in

26:20.028 --> 26:21.728
over 1,000 bucks a night?

26:21.730 --> 26:25.031
Escorts have family members
that ask questions too.

26:25.033 --> 26:27.434
Believe it or not,
I actually enjoy teaching.

26:27.436 --> 26:29.402
You know, my tutor
was a 300-pound guy

26:29.404 --> 26:31.304
whose breath
smelled like salami.

26:31.306 --> 26:32.572
Lovely.

26:32.574 --> 26:34.774
How'd you get into this
in the first place?

26:34.776 --> 26:36.576
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

26:36.578 --> 26:38.979
Don't ask questions.

26:38.981 --> 26:41.314
I...how am I supposed
to do my job then?

26:41.316 --> 26:43.149
Just don't make it feel like
an interview, you know?

26:43.151 --> 26:44.784
Let's just be friends.

26:44.786 --> 26:48.321
You do have friends, right?

26:48.323 --> 26:52.392
Yeah, and I ask them questions
when I want to know things.

26:52.394 --> 26:53.593
God, I can already tell
you're gonna be

26:53.595 --> 26:55.295
so fucking annoying.

26:55.297 --> 26:59.699
¶ Onion, two carrots,
two cups of adzuki beans ¶

26:59.701 --> 27:05.005
¶ My baby, she knows
how to keep that figure lean ¶

27:05.007 --> 27:06.706
That was cute, babe.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.108
Well, there's more
where that came from.

27:08.110 --> 27:10.944
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

27:10.946 --> 27:12.512
- That was for you.
- Oh, yeah?

27:13.415 --> 27:14.814
Hey, guys,
please stop having sex.

27:14.816 --> 27:15.882
We have company.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.350
- Hi, babe.
- Hey, babe.

27:17.352 --> 27:18.785
Mmm, hey!

27:18.787 --> 27:20.253
Dominick, Dana,
this is Mitch.

27:20.255 --> 27:21.888
- Mitch, my friends.
- Hey.

27:21.890 --> 27:22.889
Hey, how you guys doing?

27:22.891 --> 27:25.125
- Good.
- Hey, man.

27:25.127 --> 27:26.926
What'd you think of my song?

27:26.928 --> 27:30.730
Oh, it was, uh...inspiring.

27:32.367 --> 27:35.301
Rock on.

27:35.303 --> 27:37.103
Dominick's gonna be
the next Bob Dylan

27:37.105 --> 27:38.672
or John Mayer.

27:38.674 --> 27:41.408
- Bruno Mars or something.
- Certainly a wide range.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.910
Mm-hmm.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.912
Hey, thanks, man.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.647
Appreciate that.

27:47.649 --> 27:49.649
Means a lot.

27:52.988 --> 27:54.954
You guys should totally
stay for lunch.

27:54.956 --> 27:57.057
Yeah.

28:00.362 --> 28:03.430
- Shit, we just ate.
- Yeah, really full.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.699
Which is unfortunate,
'cause this all

28:05.701 --> 28:07.100
looks delicious, but...

28:07.102 --> 28:10.437
So the nice car,
the downtown loft.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.940
Is this all you,
or did your parents

28:13.942 --> 28:15.542
have money
when you were growing up?

28:15.544 --> 28:17.243
They help you out?
What's...what's going on here?

28:17.245 --> 28:20.080
Single mom,
high school teacher.

28:20.082 --> 28:23.249
- What about your dad?
- Never met him.

28:26.421 --> 28:28.354
I'm still having trouble kind of
wrapping my head around you.

28:28.356 --> 28:30.023
I mean, you went
to a great school

28:30.025 --> 28:31.291
and got a great education.

28:31.293 --> 28:35.128
You're not awful-looking.

28:35.130 --> 28:38.198
I just don't understand.

28:45.640 --> 28:49.442
Look, come on,
you gotta give me something.

28:49.444 --> 28:51.277
After graduation,
I had to get a job

28:51.279 --> 28:52.479
that paid enough
to put a dent

28:52.481 --> 28:53.313
in my student loans.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.181
This checked off
all the boxes.

28:55.183 --> 28:57.117
Okay, well,
there are plenty of normal jobs

28:57.119 --> 28:58.051
that pay well, right?

28:58.053 --> 28:59.519
Yeah, not like this.

28:59.521 --> 29:01.654
Once I hit a certain number,
I'll call it quits.

29:01.656 --> 29:03.490
I've got some ideas
of what I want to do,

29:03.492 --> 29:05.125
but for now, this is it.

29:05.127 --> 29:07.093
Number...what kind of number
are we talking about?

29:07.095 --> 29:11.030
Last year, I made
213,000 tax-free.

29:11.032 --> 29:13.600
I figure at that rate,
another 21/2 years

29:13.602 --> 29:17.437
and I'll have the flexibility
to do what I want.

29:17.439 --> 29:19.973
Holy shit.

29:19.975 --> 29:22.742
Got to get ready.
Don't be so shocked.

29:24.646 --> 29:28.581
So tell me about yourself.
Who is Mitchell Cooper?

29:28.583 --> 29:30.250
Can't we just be,
like, friends

29:30.252 --> 29:32.018
and, like, hang out
and chill and not ask questions?

29:32.020 --> 29:34.954
Hey, asshole.
I don't sound like that.

29:34.956 --> 29:36.456
What do you want to know?

29:36.458 --> 29:38.424
I don't know, anything,
whatever.

29:38.426 --> 29:42.195
Just people
with normal lives fascinate me.

29:42.197 --> 29:45.665
Normal, is that what
you think of me?

29:45.667 --> 29:47.467
Mm, I don't know.

29:47.469 --> 29:48.835
Uh, let's see.

29:48.837 --> 29:52.272
Well, I...I worked
at <i> The Los Angeles Review.</i>

29:52.274 --> 29:54.974
I mostly wrote
for the obituary section.

29:54.976 --> 29:59.112
That's kind of cool in, like,
a gothic loner kind of way.

29:59.114 --> 30:01.548
I don't know,
I just kind of...

30:01.550 --> 30:04.250
kind of enjoyed finding
the best possible combination

30:04.252 --> 30:07.487
of words to tell
someone's story, you know?

30:07.489 --> 30:09.055
I like it
when I read the obituary

30:09.057 --> 30:10.490
and I look at the picture

30:10.492 --> 30:13.293
of the person
smiling and looking all happy,

30:13.295 --> 30:15.762
and you forget
about the pancreatic cancer

30:15.764 --> 30:17.697
or whatever shit happened.

30:17.699 --> 30:22.302
It's nice.
Zip me up?

30:22.304 --> 30:24.571
Um...

30:24.573 --> 30:26.239
yeah, sure.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.941
Sure.

30:31.980 --> 30:35.114
¶ I know ¶

30:35.116 --> 30:38.184
¶ Know there's a way ¶

30:38.186 --> 30:43.189
Yeah, well,
zipped up.

30:43.191 --> 30:44.257
If you're gonna be seen
with me,

30:44.259 --> 30:46.626
I can't have you
wearing that.

30:46.628 --> 30:50.597
What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

30:50.599 --> 30:52.098
You look like Mr. Rogers.

30:56.638 --> 31:00.440
What the fuck am I wearing?

31:00.442 --> 31:01.774
What?

31:01.776 --> 31:03.509
I look like a band member
from Jesse and the Rippers

31:03.511 --> 31:05.311
from <i> Full House,</i> that's what.

31:05.313 --> 31:07.347
I think you look hip
and handsome,

31:07.349 --> 31:08.448
like you belong.

31:08.450 --> 31:11.951
- In a Robin Thicke video.
- A little bit.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.120
Well, if you're gonna be
seen with me,

31:14.122 --> 31:15.755
this is what you're wearing.

31:15.757 --> 31:17.657
You just get a couple
different color T-shirts.

31:17.659 --> 31:18.925
You rotate them around.

31:18.927 --> 31:20.860
It'll be like
a whole new outfit.

31:20.862 --> 31:22.495
- The chain looks great on you.
- I...

31:22.497 --> 31:24.697
It does.

31:24.699 --> 31:26.599
You're gonna wait at the bar
until I land a client.

31:26.601 --> 31:28.167
Don't leave.

31:28.169 --> 31:30.236
When I do get somebody,
I'm gonna go to room 1516.

31:30.238 --> 31:32.171
Just wait in the hall
until I'm done.

31:32.173 --> 31:34.173
- Remember, you're a ghost.
- Got it.

31:34.175 --> 31:38.978
But if I do summon you,
you may engage me.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.315
Engage you?
What are you, the NSA?

31:42.317 --> 31:44.017
Do I look like I'm laughing?

31:44.019 --> 31:46.085
On the outside, no,
but maybe on the inside?

31:46.087 --> 31:48.554
- No.
- Okay.

31:50.558 --> 31:51.925
All right.

31:51.927 --> 31:54.861
Can I have a drink or...

31:54.863 --> 31:58.064
Would you pay
to have sex with me?

31:58.066 --> 31:59.999
I thought we've already
been through this.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.334
I can't afford you.

32:01.336 --> 32:05.305
I know, but, like,
am I fucking hot enough?

32:05.307 --> 32:08.641
Oh, even the pros
need a pep talk

32:08.643 --> 32:11.911
once in a while, huh?

32:11.913 --> 32:15.882
I mean, yeah, you're hot.

32:18.586 --> 32:20.586
I understand
it's a part of aging,

32:20.588 --> 32:24.357
but I still think of myself
as a young guy.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.926
- Oh?
- I think it's manly.

32:26.928 --> 32:28.361
All right, here.

32:28.363 --> 32:31.364
I'll let you feel something
that's manly, huh?

32:32.634 --> 32:34.233
That's funny,
but if you try that shit again,

32:34.235 --> 32:35.535
I'm gonna have my guy over there

32:35.537 --> 32:40.073
snap off that puny excuse
for a dick.

32:40.075 --> 32:41.107
Oh, hey, I was just...

32:41.109 --> 32:43.576
I was just messing around.

32:43.578 --> 32:45.778
Come on, there's no need
to get worked up here.

32:45.780 --> 32:47.213
Come on,
we're just having drinks.

32:50.785 --> 32:55.188
Fuck yes! Oh!
Oh, my God.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.456
Bullshit.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.091
What, you don't think
it's possible

32:58.093 --> 32:59.926
for me to enjoy the sex?

32:59.928 --> 33:01.527
Not to that degree
and certainly not

33:01.529 --> 33:02.662
with a guy like that.

33:02.664 --> 33:04.697
I got to have something
for them to come back for.

33:04.699 --> 33:07.033
I mean, it's all
about generating regulars.

33:07.035 --> 33:09.202
What, you think
those artificial orgasm noises

33:09.204 --> 33:10.837
is what brings them back?

33:10.839 --> 33:12.739
Dude, I get rave reviews.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.608
I'll be sure to check out
your Yelp page when I get home.

33:15.610 --> 33:18.478
You should.
Five stars.

33:21.149 --> 33:22.582
Who's texting so much?

33:22.584 --> 33:23.850
Girlfriend?

33:23.852 --> 33:26.619
No, just people.

33:26.621 --> 33:29.655
All right, meet me here
tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

33:29.657 --> 33:32.992
All right.
Hey.

33:32.994 --> 33:37.397
Seriously,
thanks for doing this.

33:37.399 --> 33:39.465
Ride's on me.

33:43.271 --> 33:46.172
It's nice of them to give me
a complimentary tea.

33:46.174 --> 33:49.042
So do you have a pimp, or do you
do all your own bookings?

33:49.044 --> 33:51.210
All generated
by yours truly.

33:51.212 --> 33:55.281
Ah, an entrepreneur.
Why go pimp-less?

33:55.283 --> 33:56.315
They take too much
of the pie

33:56.317 --> 33:58.184
for what they're worth.

33:58.186 --> 33:59.585
But isn't it, like,
dangerous for you

33:59.587 --> 34:01.421
to be out there all alone?

34:01.423 --> 34:02.855
I'm not gonna answer
another question

34:02.857 --> 34:05.324
until you man up
and get a pedicure.

34:05.326 --> 34:07.093
No, I'm not...I'm not gonna
get a pedicure.

34:07.095 --> 34:08.194
I've never had
a pedicure before.

34:08.196 --> 34:09.429
I'm not gonna
get a pedicure.

34:09.431 --> 34:11.998
Hey, do manicures
come with this?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.199
No, that's extra.
Would you like one?

34:14.202 --> 34:16.702
Well, I just figure
since we're here.

34:16.704 --> 34:17.703
- Hmm.
- Right?

34:17.705 --> 34:18.771
Right.

34:18.773 --> 34:22.542
One-stop shopping
sort of thing.

34:22.543 --> 34:24.577
- No polish, though.
- No, of course not.

34:24.579 --> 34:25.578
No polish.

34:25.580 --> 34:28.014
Yeah...yeah, it varies

34:28.016 --> 34:30.650
anywhere from two to eight guys
a week.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.385
Most of them are regulars.

34:32.387 --> 34:33.753
Wait, let's just back up
a little bit.

34:33.755 --> 34:36.222
How do you even get into this
in the first place?

34:36.224 --> 34:37.489
Dana had just
started working,

34:37.492 --> 34:39.659
and she was making
all this money

34:39.661 --> 34:42.360
while I was barely
covering the rent from tutoring,

34:42.362 --> 34:45.297
and, um, one night,
she took me to a club

34:45.300 --> 34:47.033
and introduced me
to her pimp.

34:47.034 --> 34:50.670
Oh, so you did have a pimp
at one point?

34:50.672 --> 34:53.739
- Yes!
- Fucker.

34:53.741 --> 34:55.942
- Yeah, for a minute.
- Fuck.

34:59.047 --> 35:03.983
Yeah.
For a minute.

35:03.985 --> 35:06.152
He gave me the $900 price tag

35:06.154 --> 35:08.521
and called over
one of his clients,

35:08.523 --> 35:09.789
and before I knew it,

35:09.791 --> 35:12.892
his client came over
and pulls out a wad of cash

35:12.894 --> 35:16.362
and, um, puts it
right in front of me.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.164
You tell yourself that
you would never do something

35:18.166 --> 35:21.234
like that for money,

35:21.236 --> 35:25.304
but when it's staring at you
right in the face...

35:30.345 --> 35:33.479
Come on,
let's play another game.

35:33.481 --> 35:34.614
Let's go.

35:34.616 --> 35:36.516
Yeah, another game
where I kick your ass.

35:36.518 --> 35:38.784
All right, this is unfair.
I don't have this version.

35:38.786 --> 35:39.852
I've got two years ago.

35:42.490 --> 35:44.991
Well, aren't you guys
in a celebratory mood?

35:44.993 --> 35:48.060
Celebrating Benny's promotion,
huh?

35:48.062 --> 35:49.662
You little prick, right?

35:49.664 --> 35:52.832
Now, I bet he has sucked
more dick than you

35:52.834 --> 35:54.567
to get where you are,

35:54.569 --> 35:55.668
right there, Benny?

35:55.670 --> 35:57.837
Right?

35:57.839 --> 36:00.139
God, relax, sweet tits, okay?

36:00.141 --> 36:01.941
We're just having some fun,
all right?

36:01.943 --> 36:03.576
Let's have another shot.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.245
Hey, you want to move
this party upstairs?

36:06.247 --> 36:09.182
Whoa, whoa, group...
group table here.

36:09.184 --> 36:11.450
Come on, Warren, man, quit
giving her such a hard time.

36:11.452 --> 36:13.619
Shut the fuck up,
Benny, all right?

36:13.621 --> 36:15.788
Drink your drink, all right?
She can take it.

36:15.790 --> 36:19.525
She can take pretty much
anything I can give her, right?

36:19.527 --> 36:21.794
Huh? Oh!

36:21.796 --> 36:26.666
Ohh, you fucking slut.

36:26.668 --> 36:28.968
You know how many cocks
you would have to sit on

36:28.970 --> 36:30.236
to pay for a shirt like this?

36:30.238 --> 36:31.437
All right,
that's fucking enough.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.240
Mitch.

36:34.242 --> 36:38.044
Uh...something going on
over here?

36:38.046 --> 36:39.345
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:39.347 --> 36:43.216
Mind your own
fucking business, pal, okay?

36:43.218 --> 36:44.650
No, he's not gonna
mind his own business

36:44.652 --> 36:45.985
because he's my bodyguard,

36:45.987 --> 36:47.453
and if you don't
shut the fuck up,

36:47.455 --> 36:49.388
he's gonna beat the crap
out of you.

36:49.390 --> 36:53.025
Oh. Wow.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.730
Tough guy, huh?

37:00.101 --> 37:01.801
You heard her.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.069
If you don't shut the fuck up,

37:03.071 --> 37:05.338
I'm gonna beat the crap
out of you.

37:08.209 --> 37:10.009
Why don't you get the fuck
out of here?

37:10.011 --> 37:12.211
Fuck this.

37:23.925 --> 37:25.358
Wait, wait.

37:29.364 --> 37:31.631
Wait, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.
Wait, wait, wait.

37:31.633 --> 37:34.133
What are you, using me as, like,
some sort of pimp or something?

37:34.135 --> 37:35.401
Okay, we're using each other.

37:35.403 --> 37:36.936
You get what you want,
and I get what I want.

37:36.938 --> 37:38.738
I can't beat up five guys.
I'm not Bruce Lee.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.906
They're all talk. They're not
gonna actually do anything.

37:40.908 --> 37:42.174
Probably.

37:44.579 --> 37:47.513
Think how great
your article will be.

37:52.420 --> 37:55.621
Just don't get me killed,
okay?

37:55.623 --> 37:56.989
Thanks.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.693
Who keeps texting you?

38:00.695 --> 38:01.794
People text.
Friends text.

38:01.796 --> 38:03.162
I'm sure you text.

38:03.164 --> 38:04.163
Yeah, but that's,
like, the text frequency

38:04.165 --> 38:06.232
of a very desperate woman.

38:06.234 --> 38:08.167
Hey, we're done here, right?

38:08.169 --> 38:10.469
Yeah, I guess.

38:10.471 --> 38:14.573
All right.
I'll see you later.

38:14.575 --> 38:16.375
Just like that?

38:16.377 --> 38:21.180
Since when does a pimp have
to explain anything to his ho?

38:22.950 --> 38:31.157
¶ ¶

39:52.840 --> 39:55.908
Don't stop.
Don't stop, don't stop!

39:55.910 --> 39:58.978
Like I said,
I'm not planning on it.

40:14.762 --> 40:16.962
Fuck.

40:18.933 --> 40:20.433
I only caught the end,

40:20.435 --> 40:22.668
but I think you were doing
a little too much...

40:22.670 --> 40:25.004
- You followed me.
- Yeah, I followed you.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.539
All that text messaging,

40:26.541 --> 40:29.675
you were giving me, like,
a creepy drug pin vibe.

40:29.677 --> 40:33.512
I needed to know what it was,
and now I know.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.047
Oh, a prostitute was worried

40:35.049 --> 40:36.816
about being linked
to a seedy underworld.

40:36.818 --> 40:38.717
Yeah, if you're gonna be
in charge of my safety,

40:38.719 --> 40:40.719
I need to know that you're not
gonna just sketch off

40:40.721 --> 40:43.189
and leave me with
a potentially dangerous client.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.657
I thought you said
this wasn't gonna be dangerous.

40:44.659 --> 40:46.258
It's not gonna
be dangerous for you.

40:46.260 --> 40:48.160
I'm a sitting duck out there.

40:48.162 --> 40:50.963
Look, you're my ticket
to that job, okay?

40:50.965 --> 40:53.666
I'm not just gonna leave you.

40:53.668 --> 40:56.268
- I just wanted to be clear.
- We're clear.

40:56.270 --> 40:58.237
Perfect.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.806
How'd you meet her?

41:00.808 --> 41:02.241
Who?

41:02.243 --> 41:03.943
The girl you had bent
over the bathroom sink.

41:03.945 --> 41:06.245
I'm sure she has a name.

41:13.554 --> 41:14.820
I'm sure she does,

41:14.822 --> 41:17.289
but I don't know it.

41:17.291 --> 41:19.692
Okay, look, that app
connected us, all right?

41:19.694 --> 41:24.563
What do I care
if she's on her shift break?

41:24.565 --> 41:27.666
Is this a rare occurrence?

41:27.668 --> 41:29.568
No.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.537
This is fascinating.

41:31.539 --> 41:33.939
Do you get tested?

41:33.941 --> 41:35.174
Often.

41:35.176 --> 41:36.675
What's been your worst scare?

41:36.677 --> 41:37.676
Hep B.

41:37.678 --> 41:39.178
Hep C.

41:39.180 --> 41:40.746
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.615
- But you're all, like...
- Yeah, everything's fine, you?

41:42.617 --> 41:45.551
Oh, I'm...I'm fine.
But that two-week wait?

41:45.553 --> 41:46.952
Holy shit, right?

41:46.954 --> 41:47.953
I couldn't eat.

41:47.955 --> 41:50.689
I couldn't sleep.

41:52.493 --> 41:55.227
The worst part
is going to that clinic

41:55.229 --> 41:58.664
and sitting all alone.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.633
It's awful.

42:00.635 --> 42:04.670
And the place smells
like a funeral home.

42:04.672 --> 42:08.040
Yea...the hung poster
of the ethnically diverse

42:08.042 --> 42:10.943
STD-free people
just kind of smiling there?

42:10.945 --> 42:13.212
Yeah, what the fuck
is that about?

42:16.784 --> 42:18.684
Hey, I don't know
what you're doing on Sunday,

42:18.686 --> 42:21.887
but I'm heading to my dad's
house for dinner, and if...

42:21.889 --> 42:24.623
You want me to meet
your family?

42:24.625 --> 42:26.725
Not my fam...I mean,
it's just my dad

42:26.727 --> 42:29.495
and my sister,
but yeah.

42:29.497 --> 42:31.196
It'd be fun.

42:31.198 --> 42:34.099
What's this really about?

42:34.101 --> 42:35.167
What do you mean?

42:35.169 --> 42:36.235
I thought
it was poor form

42:36.237 --> 42:37.636
to bring your work
home with you.

42:37.638 --> 42:41.807
Well, you're a presentable
piece of work.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.476
Okay, look, my family
thinks that I'm kind of,

42:44.478 --> 42:46.312
like, a big fuck-up,
and, well,

42:46.314 --> 42:49.214
you're smart and pretty
and personable.

42:49.216 --> 42:51.483
And if I were to bring
someone like you home,

42:51.485 --> 42:54.520
they'd, you know, think
I'm getting my shit together.

42:56.557 --> 42:58.524
You think I'm pretty?

42:58.526 --> 43:00.593
Look, just...

43:00.595 --> 43:02.595
deal or no?

43:02.597 --> 43:05.464
I suppose
I'll wear something tasteful

43:05.466 --> 43:08.901
and girlfriend-y,

43:08.903 --> 43:10.135
but I'm not holding your hand,

43:10.137 --> 43:11.737
and you can't call me
babe or boo

43:11.739 --> 43:13.172
or anything
that starts with a B.

43:13.174 --> 43:14.740
Oh, my God, monkey,
you're gonna be great.

43:14.742 --> 43:17.576
Don't even.

43:19.981 --> 43:21.847
With all the time
you're spending on this article,

43:21.849 --> 43:23.482
it better be good, man.

43:23.484 --> 43:26.986
It's good, I think.
I don't know.

43:26.988 --> 43:30.022
Wow, you sound
super confident.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.457
How far into it are you?

43:31.459 --> 43:35.027
It's still in the, uh,
researching stage.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.996
You gonna tell me
what it's about or what?

43:36.998 --> 43:38.564
Nope.

43:38.566 --> 43:39.765
Why?

43:39.767 --> 43:42.201
You're just gonna
be annoying about it.

43:42.203 --> 43:44.737
Am I ever annoying?

43:44.739 --> 43:46.305
All right, fine, it's, um,

43:46.307 --> 43:48.207
just some profile
on some girl.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.709
It's nothing.

43:50.711 --> 43:53.412
And she's topical?
Why?

43:53.414 --> 43:56.749
Well, uh,
she went to Stanford.

43:56.751 --> 43:58.517
Second-tier school, but...

43:58.519 --> 44:01.020
And, um, you know,

44:01.022 --> 44:03.288
men pay her for...for sex.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.495
You're doing a profile
on a prostitute?

44:09.497 --> 44:11.997
Well, if you want
to get technical about it,

44:11.999 --> 44:13.432
I guess, but...

44:13.434 --> 44:15.234
Well, I mean, they do say
write what you know.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.369
What are you fucking doing?

44:20.374 --> 44:28.781
¶ ¶

44:28.783 --> 44:30.649
All right, this one?

44:38.192 --> 44:41.260
You didn't tell me
you were Bruce fucking Wayne.

44:41.262 --> 44:45.831
Is this new money, old money?
What's going on here?

44:45.833 --> 44:48.400
My dad was a songwriter
in the '70s.

44:48.402 --> 44:50.602
Probably a bunch
of classics that

44:50.604 --> 44:53.672
you've never heard of and none
that I care to remember.

44:57.378 --> 44:59.611
Okay.

45:03.350 --> 45:06.118
You look like
Betty White's granddaughter.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.386
Did you win
your chess tournament?

45:07.388 --> 45:10.055
- I did, actually.
- I look great.

45:10.057 --> 45:11.523
Shit, how do I
address the butler?

45:11.525 --> 45:13.959
- I've never done this.
- I don't have a butler.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.627
Em, hey.

45:15.629 --> 45:17.362
I was beginning to think
you forgot about me.

45:17.364 --> 45:19.832
- You? Come on.
- Hey, I'm Natalie.

45:19.834 --> 45:22.134
Holy shit.
You're pretty.

45:22.136 --> 45:24.169
Well, you're adorable
yourself, little lady.

45:24.171 --> 45:25.504
This is my sister...

45:25.506 --> 45:29.308
But you're, like,
so fucking pretty.

45:29.310 --> 45:30.809
You're, uh,
you're so fucking pretty.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.311
I like her.

45:37.351 --> 45:39.418
I see Dad's not getting on you
about the cursing.

45:39.420 --> 45:41.220
If he's gonna
make me play JV football,

45:41.222 --> 45:44.990
he's gonna have to deal
with the cursing I'm exposed to.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.425
Why is he making you
play football?

45:46.427 --> 45:48.093
Because Mitch quit
when he was in high school,

45:48.095 --> 45:49.962
and he doesn't want me
ending up like him.

45:49.964 --> 45:51.396
Why, what's wrong with Mitch?

45:51.398 --> 45:53.532
Dad says he's poor
and will continue to be poor

45:53.534 --> 45:56.335
if he keeps working
in a dying industry.

45:56.337 --> 45:57.569
Wait here.

45:59.140 --> 46:01.507
Home.
I love it.

46:01.509 --> 46:05.277
Mitch is here.

46:05.279 --> 46:08.113
He's on to some workout video
these days.

46:12.553 --> 46:14.253
Mitchell.

46:15.990 --> 46:17.856
Dad, hey.
Good to...

46:17.858 --> 46:19.958
- Ha, yeah.
- See you.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.960
Yeah, you too.

46:21.962 --> 46:23.896
You're wearing your contact
lenses again, aren't you?

46:23.898 --> 46:25.197
Yeah.

46:25.199 --> 46:28.500
You look a lot less anal
without your glasses.

46:28.502 --> 46:31.103
Thank you, I think.

46:31.105 --> 46:32.471
And this must be?

46:32.473 --> 46:33.472
I'm Natalie.

46:33.474 --> 46:35.641
Gorgeous, just gorgeous.

46:35.643 --> 46:37.910
- I'm Charles.
- You have a beautiful home.

46:37.912 --> 46:39.344
Eh, it's all right.

46:39.346 --> 46:41.313
It's been a while
since Mitchell

46:41.315 --> 46:42.981
brought a girlfriend
around here.

46:42.983 --> 46:45.551
How long you two been dating?

46:45.553 --> 46:48.187
- Uh, four...
- Six...

46:48.189 --> 46:49.288
Four to six months.

46:49.290 --> 46:50.389
We...we average it
out to five.

46:50.391 --> 46:51.957
The beginning
is always weird.

46:51.959 --> 46:53.525
Does it start
with the first text message,

46:53.527 --> 46:54.326
the first kiss?

46:54.328 --> 46:56.295
First kiss.
Totes.

46:56.297 --> 46:58.463
Totes. Monkey,
why don't you write that down?

46:58.465 --> 47:00.332
First kiss.

47:00.334 --> 47:03.402
Stanford?
That's impressive.

47:03.404 --> 47:06.672
I knew a girl
from Stanford once.

47:06.674 --> 47:09.174
Twice, actually.

47:09.176 --> 47:11.777
Natalie's running
her own tutoring business.

47:11.779 --> 47:13.245
Can you tutor me
in biology?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.513
My teacher's got it out
for me.

47:14.515 --> 47:17.115
- She's a grade-A cunt.
- Language.

47:17.117 --> 47:19.251
JV football.

47:19.253 --> 47:21.420
I wish I could,
but I only teach math.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.689
Ha, Mitchell was never
any good at math.

47:23.691 --> 47:25.123
Emily here's a whiz.

47:25.125 --> 47:27.526
Look at that, ten minutes
before putting me down.

47:27.528 --> 47:28.861
That's a new record.

47:28.863 --> 47:31.163
Not everybody is good
at the same things, Mitchell.

47:31.165 --> 47:33.165
Dad doesn't think Mitch
applies himself and says

47:33.167 --> 47:36.468
he looks to blame
other people for his problems.

47:36.470 --> 47:38.804
I think
Mitch is gonna be just fine.

47:38.806 --> 47:40.005
I've actually been
reading the article

47:40.007 --> 47:41.240
that he's writing
for that magazine,

47:41.242 --> 47:43.775
and it's really good.

47:43.777 --> 47:45.344
He's a great writer.

47:45.346 --> 47:47.412
Well, that's great news,
Mitchell.

47:47.414 --> 47:48.947
What's it about?

47:48.949 --> 47:51.984
The article, uh, it's, um...

47:51.986 --> 47:55.420
Well, you know when, um...

47:55.422 --> 47:59.424
How...how would I
describe this?

47:59.426 --> 48:03.795
It's about me
and my business.

48:03.797 --> 48:04.997
The learning habits
of children

48:04.999 --> 48:08.033
and what motivates them
and such.

48:08.035 --> 48:10.402
Wow, can't wait
to read that one.

48:10.404 --> 48:11.670
No offense.

48:11.672 --> 48:13.705
Yeah, no disrespect
to your profession, Natalie,

48:13.707 --> 48:16.208
but it seems like if this is
a one-shot audition thing,

48:16.210 --> 48:17.876
why not just do something
a little more,

48:17.878 --> 48:20.212
I don't know, risqué?

48:20.214 --> 48:22.047
Oh, I have a feeling
if the article gets published,

48:22.049 --> 48:24.650
the risqué will pop out.

48:30.758 --> 48:34.159
Yeah?

48:34.161 --> 48:38.196
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:38.198 --> 48:39.531
She's pretty great, huh?

48:39.533 --> 48:42.334
Yeah, you might want
to hang on to that one.

48:42.336 --> 48:44.069
Yeah.

48:44.071 --> 48:47.005
Hey, do you mind if I...

48:47.007 --> 48:49.975
Uh...sure.

48:49.977 --> 48:52.411
What can I do for you?

48:55.783 --> 49:00.118
So you remember last week?

49:00.120 --> 49:02.654
Do you remember last week
when I was short on rent?

49:02.656 --> 49:04.756
Well, since I'm not gonna
find out about this article

49:04.758 --> 49:07.826
for a few more weeks, I'm gonna
be short next week too.

49:07.828 --> 49:09.861
Mitchell, you know that
I don't mind helping you out,

49:09.863 --> 49:11.496
even though my therapist
is begging me

49:11.498 --> 49:12.597
to stop enabling you.

49:12.599 --> 49:14.066
Well, it's just
until I get this job,

49:14.068 --> 49:15.600
and by the way,
it's looking good,

49:15.602 --> 49:17.836
so I'm sure your therapist
would be fine with that.

49:17.838 --> 49:20.238
It's not just Dr. Polanski.

49:20.240 --> 49:21.640
No?

49:24.445 --> 49:26.745
- It's Krystal as well.
- Who's Krystal?

49:26.747 --> 49:28.580
- She's my astrologist.
- I'm sorry, your what?

49:28.582 --> 49:29.915
My astrologist.

49:29.917 --> 49:33.785
She says when Mercury
is in retrograde,

49:33.787 --> 49:34.886
like it is right now,

49:34.888 --> 49:36.555
I can't do anything financial.

49:36.557 --> 49:38.690
In fact, she's instructed me
to freeze all my accounts

49:38.692 --> 49:40.158
for the month.

49:43.797 --> 49:45.664
Dad, th...

49:45.666 --> 49:49.701
this is the last time,
I swear.

49:49.703 --> 49:53.638
Mitchell, I'm sorry.
I wish I could help you out.

49:53.640 --> 49:57.142
Retrograde is retrograde.

49:57.144 --> 49:59.678
Right, uh, retrograde.

49:59.680 --> 50:01.179
Yeah.

50:04.418 --> 50:06.918
Okay, Dad.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.420
Oh, have you gone
to any of those meetings

50:08.422 --> 50:10.489
that Dr. Polanski
suggested for the sex thing?

50:10.491 --> 50:12.657
- No, I didn't.
- You really might want to go.

50:12.659 --> 50:14.159
He can help you.

50:15.262 --> 50:16.461
- 31/2.
- Can you do that?

50:16.463 --> 50:18.430
Okay, no big.

50:22.202 --> 50:24.569
Hey, just text us when
you get picked up, all right?

50:24.571 --> 50:27.639
I'll get a ride home
from one of the girls.

50:27.641 --> 50:30.275
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

50:30.277 --> 50:32.711
Hey, thanks for being
so cool at dinner tonight.

50:32.713 --> 50:36.048
I know my dad
can be a little much.

50:36.050 --> 50:38.483
No, they're cool.

50:38.485 --> 50:39.584
I had fun.

50:39.586 --> 50:41.453
Although, if you do
get this job,

50:41.455 --> 50:44.656
don't tell your dad
that I'm your prostitute muse.

50:44.658 --> 50:46.191
It'll break his heart.

50:46.193 --> 50:49.294
I really think
he likes you.

50:49.296 --> 50:52.798
I know.

50:52.800 --> 50:57.969
So, uh...you probably
want to go home now.

50:57.971 --> 50:59.404
What, are you kicking me out?

50:59.406 --> 51:02.374
No, no,
I'm just saying here's your out,

51:02.376 --> 51:04.543
if you want it.

51:04.545 --> 51:07.446
Yeah, what I want to do is
I want to drink wine

51:07.448 --> 51:10.048
on the porch of that giant
fucking <i> Scarface</i> mansion.

51:10.050 --> 51:11.716
That's what I want to do.

51:11.718 --> 51:14.286
Then let's do that.

51:14.288 --> 51:17.656
Why do you go to a bar
to pick up guys?

51:17.658 --> 51:19.391
Why don't you have, like,
an online profile?

51:19.393 --> 51:21.126
I'm not a fan
of the Internet.

51:21.128 --> 51:22.828
That's trending
downwards anyway,

51:22.830 --> 51:26.364
so I wouldn't worry
about it.

51:26.366 --> 51:29.201
No, really,
why are you an escort?

51:29.203 --> 51:30.368
And I don't want
to hear any bullshit

51:30.370 --> 51:32.204
about how bad
the economy is.

51:32.206 --> 51:36.942
You could do
anything you want.

51:36.944 --> 51:38.910
- I can't get a job.
- Bullshit.

51:38.912 --> 51:40.946
I don't believe that.

51:43.050 --> 51:46.251
Okay, look,
this is off the record.

51:46.253 --> 51:48.920
- Okay.
- No, I'm serious.

51:48.922 --> 51:50.989
You cannot put this
in the article.

51:50.991 --> 51:52.557
Okay.

52:02.469 --> 52:04.169
When I was a senior
in college,

52:04.171 --> 52:06.404
I made a list of the guys

52:06.406 --> 52:07.973
that I had sex with
in school,

52:07.975 --> 52:11.109
and I put it into
this PowerPoint presentation

52:11.111 --> 52:14.112
with pictures and things
like dick size estimates,

52:14.114 --> 52:16.281
and, I mean,
it was awesome.

52:16.283 --> 52:17.549
And I forwarded it
to a bunch

52:17.551 --> 52:20.485
of my girlfriends
as a stupid joke.

52:20.487 --> 52:24.456
Was there, like,
a lot of guys on this list?

52:24.458 --> 52:26.358
What's a lot?

52:26.360 --> 52:31.897
I don't know, like,
20s, 30...9...

52:31.899 --> 52:35.500
There was a lot.

52:35.502 --> 52:36.968
I was in college.

52:36.970 --> 52:38.570
I enjoy sex,
and I don't think

52:38.572 --> 52:41.640
that that is anything
to be ashamed of.

52:43.944 --> 52:46.678
But one of my asshole friends

52:46.680 --> 52:49.014
decides to forward it
to one of her guy friends,

52:49.016 --> 52:50.949
who forwards it
to one of his guy friends,

52:50.951 --> 52:52.617
and before you know it,

52:52.619 --> 52:56.354
it's hit all the major blogs,
<i>The Huffington Post.</i>

52:56.356 --> 52:59.257
Piers Morgan
was gracious enough

52:59.259 --> 53:02.260
to use me
as an example on CNN

53:02.262 --> 53:05.297
in supporting his claim
that our selfie generation

53:05.299 --> 53:07.532
is the demise
of civilization

53:07.534 --> 53:10.135
as we know it.

53:10.137 --> 53:11.903
I remember reading
about this.

53:11.905 --> 53:13.672
- That was me.
- That's you?

53:13.674 --> 53:16.975
That's me.

53:16.977 --> 53:18.743
Try getting a job
when every Google search

53:18.745 --> 53:22.614
of your name has the word
"whore" next to it.

53:22.616 --> 53:26.918
I figure, if I'm gonna
be called a whore,

53:26.920 --> 53:29.654
I might as well
get paid like one.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.227
I'm sorry.

53:37.231 --> 53:39.364
Yeah.

53:39.366 --> 53:42.334
Everybody's got something,
I guess.

53:42.336 --> 53:44.436
No, but that's, like,
a big something.

53:44.438 --> 53:46.471
Thanks, dick.

53:51.011 --> 53:52.644
- What's up?
- Oh, shit.

53:52.646 --> 53:55.513
Uh, we got to go
pick up Emily.

54:00.087 --> 54:02.654
- What the...
- What happened?

54:07.294 --> 54:09.661
The girls wouldn't stop
calling me Ice Box,

54:09.663 --> 54:11.796
and now I feel sick too.

54:11.798 --> 54:12.931
I just want to go home.

54:12.933 --> 54:14.065
They called you what?

54:14.067 --> 54:15.934
Ice Box, the girl
who plays football

54:15.936 --> 54:18.003
in the <i> Little Giants.</i>

54:18.005 --> 54:21.273
<i>Little Giants,</i>
that's pretty funny.

54:21.275 --> 54:23.275
No, it's not funny at all.

54:23.277 --> 54:24.809
Why are they so mean to me?

54:24.811 --> 54:26.344
- What did I do wrong?
- You know what?

54:26.346 --> 54:28.413
I'm gonna say something.
Nobody bullies my little sister.

54:28.415 --> 54:30.148
- No, I got this.
- No, you don't have to.

54:30.150 --> 54:32.717
No, I got this.

54:35.722 --> 54:41.059
¶ ¶

54:41.061 --> 54:43.795
She looks like
one tough motherfucker.

54:43.797 --> 54:47.299
Language.
But yeah.

54:47.301 --> 54:55.240
¶ ¶

54:55.242 --> 54:56.675
You're not what I expected.

54:56.677 --> 54:57.976
- Oh, shit.
- What?

54:57.978 --> 54:59.044
That's the wrong house.

54:59.046 --> 55:00.445
Listen, you little bitch,

55:00.447 --> 55:02.013
I knew girls like you
in high school,

55:02.015 --> 55:03.014
and you know
what happened to them?

55:04.217 --> 55:05.283
Come on.

55:05.285 --> 55:07.085
You better get
your shit together

55:07.087 --> 55:08.119
and stop picking on other girls.

55:09.222 --> 55:10.522
You don't make yourself taller

55:10.524 --> 55:12.590
by standing on the toes
of others, got it?

55:12.592 --> 55:13.892
Dad?

55:13.894 --> 55:16.461
Yeah, go ahead.
Call your daddy.

55:16.463 --> 55:18.763
I'd like to have a word
with him too.

55:20.367 --> 55:21.700
What?

55:21.702 --> 55:23.668
Hey, you're at the wrong house.
Get back to the car.

55:23.670 --> 55:24.936
Wrong house,
get back to the car.

55:24.938 --> 55:26.438
Let's go.

55:26.440 --> 55:30.975
¶ ¶

55:30.977 --> 55:32.510
You couldn't get
in the driver's seat?

55:32.512 --> 55:34.245
My license expired
five years ago.

55:34.247 --> 55:35.647
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- I'm going.

55:35.649 --> 55:37.482
Got a ponytail and everything.
Let's go.

55:37.484 --> 55:40.118
Why do I have
to be the getaway driver?

55:47.461 --> 55:49.761
Don't let those girls
get to you.

55:49.763 --> 55:51.363
I wish it were that easy.

55:51.365 --> 55:53.064
They're threatened by you.

55:53.066 --> 55:54.532
You're on the football team,
getting to spend

55:54.534 --> 55:56.768
all that intimate time
with all the cute guys

55:56.770 --> 55:58.937
that they have crushes on.

55:58.939 --> 56:00.338
And they're not confident,

56:00.340 --> 56:04.876
so they try and make you
feel as sad as they do.

56:04.878 --> 56:06.478
You really think that?

56:06.480 --> 56:10.515
Yup, and if you let them
get to you,

56:10.517 --> 56:13.485
then they've won.

56:24.931 --> 56:27.031
Do you want to go
to my bedroom?

56:27.033 --> 56:29.067
My bedroom's upstairs,
if you want to go to sleep.

56:29.069 --> 56:31.369
Your bedroom's upstairs?
Is that what you said?

56:31.371 --> 56:33.605
Yeah, you can sleep up there.
I'll sleep here on the couch.

56:33.607 --> 56:35.306
Look, we have to sleep
in the same bedroom

56:35.308 --> 56:37.876
if your dad's gonna think
we're dating.

56:37.878 --> 56:39.411
I'm being a gentleman.

56:39.413 --> 56:41.379
Don't be weird.

56:41.381 --> 56:43.081
- I am not being weird.
- You're totally being weird.

56:43.083 --> 56:46.384
- I'm not being weird.
- Okay, shh.

56:58.665 --> 57:01.399
You need help there, Shrek?

57:08.308 --> 57:11.476
That was really sweet,
what you did for Emily tonight.

57:11.478 --> 57:14.412
Even if it meant
making a harmless girl cry.

57:14.414 --> 57:17.649
There are no harmless
high school girls.

57:17.651 --> 57:20.885
You really took charge.

57:20.887 --> 57:22.353
Sometimes you got
to read a situation

57:22.355 --> 57:26.958
and take the bull
by the horns.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.426
When was the last time
you kissed a guy off the job?

57:28.428 --> 57:30.428
I don't kiss guys on the job.

57:30.430 --> 57:33.698
When was your last kiss?

57:33.700 --> 57:38.002
I don't know,
it's been a while.

57:38.004 --> 57:42.807
Any new techniques
I should know about?

57:42.809 --> 57:44.309
¶ So you're there ¶

57:44.311 --> 57:50.048
¶ From the mirror's other side ¶

57:50.050 --> 57:54.853
¶ So you can feel truth see ¶

57:54.855 --> 57:59.691
¶ Through you ¶

57:59.693 --> 58:02.427
¶ Come inside ¶

58:02.429 --> 58:03.995
¶ Whoa oh oh ¶

58:03.997 --> 58:05.163
- See you later?
- Yeah.

58:05.165 --> 58:08.399
¶ Your wounds will heal ¶

58:08.401 --> 58:10.134
¶ Whoa oh oh ¶

58:10.136 --> 58:13.037
¶ And all is revealed ¶

58:13.039 --> 58:14.472
Hey, Mitch.

58:14.474 --> 58:18.176
¶ But what would we know
of the sentient life? ¶

58:18.178 --> 58:20.845
I want you to have this.

58:20.847 --> 58:22.113
What is it?

58:22.115 --> 58:23.581
I overheard your conversation
with your dad.

58:23.583 --> 58:26.351
- No, I-I can't take this.
- No, no, take it.

58:26.353 --> 58:28.786
You'll pay me back
after you get your new job.

58:28.788 --> 58:32.257
¶ From the mirror's other side ¶

58:32.259 --> 58:34.959
Just take it.

58:34.961 --> 58:37.095
¶ So you can feel ¶

58:39.533 --> 58:43.368
Uh, what...
hey, so what are you doing now?

58:43.370 --> 58:46.971
Uh, run home and then I have
an appointment at the clinic,

58:46.973 --> 58:48.540
you know,
the one over on Grand Avenue?

58:48.542 --> 58:50.174
Yeah, yeah, I like that one.

58:50.176 --> 58:51.509
Comfortable waiting room chairs
over there.

58:51.511 --> 58:53.478
Yeah, they're a little worn
for my liking,

58:53.480 --> 58:55.647
but it's not as bad
as the one on Wilshire.

58:55.649 --> 58:57.649
No, those are bad.

58:59.786 --> 59:03.821
- Um...
- Go already.

59:03.823 --> 59:06.024
Hey, uh...

59:08.261 --> 59:10.495
Thank you.

59:10.497 --> 59:15.099
¶ It only wants,
it only wants us all ¶

59:18.038 --> 59:21.472
¶ Come inside ¶

59:21.474 --> 59:23.141
¶ Whoa oh oh ¶

59:23.143 --> 59:26.878
¶ So we can feel ¶

59:26.880 --> 59:28.780
¶ Whoa oh oh ¶

59:28.782 --> 59:32.550
¶ That all is revealed ¶

59:32.552 --> 59:35.019
¶ Whoa oh oh ¶

59:37.557 --> 59:40.858
¶ Come inside ¶

59:40.860 --> 59:42.694
¶ Whoa oh oh ¶

59:42.696 --> 59:46.464
¶ So we can feel ¶

59:46.466 --> 59:48.232
¶ Whoa oh oh ¶

59:48.234 --> 59:52.503
¶ Your heart out of steel ¶

59:52.505 --> 59:58.142
¶ But what would we know
of the sentient life? ¶

59:58.144 --> 01:00:03.548
¶ We only know,
we only know a lie ¶

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:09.253
¶ It only wants,
it only wants us all ¶

01:00:15.161 --> 01:00:17.495
Can I read that
when you're done?

01:00:17.497 --> 01:00:20.031
What are you doing here?

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:23.735
You said how much
you hated these places, so...

01:00:23.737 --> 01:00:26.604
I didn't want you
to be alone.

01:00:32.245 --> 01:00:35.647
What is...
This looks depressing.

01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:44.756
How long you been here?

01:00:44.758 --> 01:00:46.724
Hours.

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.426
Hitting the clinic, huh?

01:00:48.428 --> 01:00:52.563
Quite a thoughtful gesture
for a work associate.

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:56.634
I'm a...I'm a good friend,
you know?

01:00:56.636 --> 01:00:59.837
I'm helping you build
this desk, aren't I?

01:00:59.839 --> 01:01:02.807
Yeah.
Your dad know about this escort?

01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:04.308
He's met her, yeah,

01:01:04.310 --> 01:01:07.879
but he...he doesn't, like,
know what she does.

01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:09.480
And you're not gonna tell him.

01:01:09.482 --> 01:01:11.416
Nothing to tell
if nothing's going on, right?

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:13.151
Look, man, I can just talk
to her about things

01:01:13.153 --> 01:01:14.786
that I can't talk about
with just anyone.

01:01:14.788 --> 01:01:17.355
What's that mean, you can't
talk to me about stuff?

01:01:17.357 --> 01:01:19.724
She doesn't judge me, man.

01:01:19.726 --> 01:01:21.726
Mitch, I don't judge.

01:01:21.728 --> 01:01:23.394
I observe,

01:01:23.396 --> 01:01:25.296
and I think it's great
that you got a new buddy,

01:01:25.298 --> 01:01:27.265
but why not bond with someone

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:30.201
who's into <i> World of Warcraft</i>
or Sudoku or water parks?

01:01:30.203 --> 01:01:34.138
Anything other
than sex with dudes for money.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.540
That's dangerous.

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.275
What are you...
why are you standing?

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:39.644
You call me over here
to help you build a desk,

01:01:39.646 --> 01:01:40.845
and I'm doing all the work.

01:01:40.847 --> 01:01:42.380
I help you sometimes.

01:01:42.382 --> 01:01:43.514
When?

01:01:43.516 --> 01:01:45.850
Like last week,
I gave you a fully loaded iPod.

01:01:45.852 --> 01:01:47.151
That was a first generation

01:01:47.153 --> 01:01:48.753
with a bunch of Celtic music
on it.

01:01:48.755 --> 01:01:50.221
I don't even know
what I'm gonna do with that.

01:01:50.223 --> 01:01:52.056
Listen to it.
Go for a fucking jog.

01:01:52.058 --> 01:01:54.492
- I ca...
- It's very rousing music.

01:01:54.494 --> 01:01:55.893
- Where are you going?
- You know what?

01:01:55.895 --> 01:01:57.228
Like, every time
we hang out,

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:59.297
all you do is just
point out my problems.

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.799
Well, here's your problem, man.
You're an asshole.

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.836
I don't feel the need to
tell you that every single day.

01:02:04.838 --> 01:02:08.106
No...Mitch.

01:02:08.108 --> 01:02:10.308
I can't do
these kinds of things!

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:17.348
¶ ¶

01:02:19.285 --> 01:02:21.586
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah.

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:32.396
¶ ¶

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:49.981
What is this?

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:52.083
Uh, why don't you
have a seat, Mitch?

01:02:52.085 --> 01:02:55.086
We just want to talk to you.

01:02:55.088 --> 01:02:56.788
Uh, about what?

01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:58.823
Mitch, take seat.

01:02:58.825 --> 01:03:00.525
Or you can stand, if you're
more comfortable like that.

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:04.695
This is...
this is for you, so...

01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:07.398
Why is Junior here?
Why...why is my landlord here?

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.134
They needed me
for unlock apartment.

01:03:10.136 --> 01:03:13.204
I ask what for.
They tell me.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:16.140
I am here to support.

01:03:16.142 --> 01:03:17.275
What did they tell you?

01:03:17.277 --> 01:03:18.676
That you have a problem

01:03:18.678 --> 01:03:20.711
that's been taking over
your life for years.

01:03:20.713 --> 01:03:24.448
Even though you think
you don't hurt people, you do.

01:03:25.652 --> 01:03:28.686
So, JP,
you've staged an intervention?

01:03:28.688 --> 01:03:30.254
There...there's four people here.

01:03:30.256 --> 01:03:32.490
Typically there...
there's more than four.

01:03:32.492 --> 01:03:34.592
Well, that's...that's part
of the problem.

01:03:34.594 --> 01:03:37.395
These are the only people
that cared enough to show up.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.996
You couldn't even get
Allie here?

01:03:38.998 --> 01:03:40.832
No, Thursday tennis lessons

01:03:40.834 --> 01:03:42.967
that she missed last week,
which turned into this thing...

01:03:42.969 --> 01:03:47.138
JP told me about the sex app
thing or whatever.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.907
This is just
getting out of hand, son.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:53.211
Mitch, you have to stop
the drinking.

01:03:53.213 --> 01:03:56.781
It hurts the people you love
who love you back so much.

01:03:56.783 --> 01:03:59.083
I'm, uh, not an alcoholic.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:02.186
Drugs.
That's even worse.

01:04:02.188 --> 01:04:05.923
- My son is addicted to sex.
- What?

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.425
I think we got it
from here, bud.

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:09.393
Thank you.

01:04:09.395 --> 01:04:12.263
Son, I think it's time
that you get serious

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:14.198
about getting some real help.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.902
I'm sorry, you say
he's addicted to sex

01:04:17.904 --> 01:04:19.937
as if it's a bad thing?

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.472
We all care
about you, Mitch.

01:04:21.474 --> 01:04:24.976
We all just want
to see you get better.

01:04:24.978 --> 01:04:28.079
Em, what have I ever
done to you?

01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:29.747
Whenever I have plans
to visit you,

01:04:29.749 --> 01:04:31.616
you cancel last minute.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:35.953
You've been home, like, four
weekends in the past two years.

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:37.421
You always say
you're there for me,

01:04:37.423 --> 01:04:40.224
but you're never actually there.

01:04:40.226 --> 01:04:43.160
Mitchell, it doesn't matter
how you ended up here.

01:04:43.162 --> 01:04:46.931
The important thing
is where you go from here.

01:04:46.933 --> 01:04:48.232
How I ended up here?

01:04:48.234 --> 01:04:50.101
You want to use
this weak-ass intervention

01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:52.203
to figure out
how I ended up here?

01:04:52.205 --> 01:04:56.207
- Krystal says...
- Fuck Krystal.

01:04:56.209 --> 01:04:59.343
Hell, I'm surprised
you're even here.

01:04:59.345 --> 01:05:01.779
Shouldn't you be out
walking the Great Wall

01:05:01.781 --> 01:05:06.584
or hanging out with some
energy healing voodoo master?

01:05:06.586 --> 01:05:07.885
But you know what I do remember?

01:05:07.887 --> 01:05:11.822
I remember
my high school graduation,

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:15.126
you not being there 'cause
you had fucking Burning Man.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.697
- No, Mitch...
- This is bullshit, JP.

01:05:19.699 --> 01:05:22.166
- Mitch?
- Come on, man.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.402
We didn't even...this was just
the intro part.

01:05:24.404 --> 01:05:27.204
This sex app...
how you search?

01:05:27.206 --> 01:05:28.839
Sex? Sex app?
Just...

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.541
No, you just...
you have a ton of apps.

01:05:30.543 --> 01:05:31.575
I know.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:42.586
¶ ¶

01:05:46.459 --> 01:05:48.859
All right,
I'm gonna head out there.

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:51.128
I'm here if you need me.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.268
All right.
What is the deal?

01:05:58.905 --> 01:06:00.838
What?
Nothing.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.106
Nothing?

01:06:02.108 --> 01:06:03.341
You were acting weird
on the way over here,

01:06:03.343 --> 01:06:06.644
and now you're not even
looking at me.

01:06:06.646 --> 01:06:08.579
I'm fine.

01:06:11.684 --> 01:06:16.587
Does this have anything
to do with the other night?

01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:18.990
I don't give a shit
about that.

01:07:02.969 --> 01:07:05.202
Hey, I...I said
not on the lips.

01:07:05.204 --> 01:07:09.073
I said not on the lips.

01:07:11.077 --> 01:07:15.046
Hey. I can't.

01:07:20.586 --> 01:07:22.453
- Just...
- Hey.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:25.289
Jesus, the waiters here
get creepier every day.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.490
Mitch, I can
handle this, okay?

01:07:26.492 --> 01:07:27.458
Wait, you know this guy?

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.759
Hey, buddy, I think
you better leave.

01:07:28.761 --> 01:07:29.927
Look, I've got a better idea.

01:07:29.929 --> 01:07:32.463
Maybe you
and your faggot necklace

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.331
could get the fuck out
of my face,

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:36.500
and later on I'll take a picture
of me fucking your friend,

01:07:36.502 --> 01:07:38.035
so you have something
to jerk off to.

01:07:38.037 --> 01:07:41.539
Hey. Mitch, stop it!

01:07:41.541 --> 01:07:42.773
Stop it!
Mitch!

01:07:42.775 --> 01:07:45.276
Hey, hey!

01:07:45.278 --> 01:07:46.644
Get the fuck out of here!

01:08:00.893 --> 01:08:03.060
¶ And there's nothing left ¶

01:08:03.062 --> 01:08:05.796
¶ Nothing left for me ¶

You know, you should really
lock your door

01:08:13.506 --> 01:08:17.108
if you don't want
people barging in.

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:19.577
Since when do you give a shit
about protecting me?

01:08:19.578 --> 01:08:22.145
That's what you wanted, right?
You wanted protection.

01:08:22.148 --> 01:08:23.413
You wanted someone
to care about you,

01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:24.782
so that's exactly
what I gave you.

01:08:24.783 --> 01:08:26.149
Oh, don't give me that.

01:08:26.152 --> 01:08:28.319
You're using me just like
everybody else does,

01:08:28.321 --> 01:08:29.819
but it's
for your magazine article

01:08:29.822 --> 01:08:31.555
and to con your Dad
into giving you money.

01:08:31.557 --> 01:08:32.890
And you're perfect?

01:08:32.892 --> 01:08:34.325
You became a hooker
because you bragged

01:08:34.327 --> 01:08:37.127
about fucking a bunch
of guys in college.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.899
You know, you could say
that Victoria's

01:08:41.901 --> 01:08:44.435
just a character
that you play,

01:08:44.437 --> 01:08:46.937
but you like this job.

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:48.506
You revel in it.

01:08:48.508 --> 01:08:51.675
You're comfortable in it
because you're in control.

01:08:51.676 --> 01:08:53.611
You dictate the terms.

01:08:53.613 --> 01:08:55.279
You don't have to worry
about being rejected

01:08:55.281 --> 01:08:56.647
by a bunch of guys
who just want

01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:59.649
to come all over you.

01:08:59.652 --> 01:09:01.152
And you're just a sad person

01:09:01.154 --> 01:09:03.921
who revels
in his own self-loathing.

01:09:03.923 --> 01:09:06.157
I'll end the debate
for you right now, Mitch.

01:09:06.158 --> 01:09:07.892
You're not a sex addict.

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.894
You're just
an emotionally crippled child

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.761
with low self-esteem
who uses sex

01:09:11.764 --> 01:09:13.330
to numb his feelings.

01:09:13.332 --> 01:09:16.466
Your problem isn't sex.
Your problem is reality.

01:09:16.469 --> 01:09:19.970
Sex is just
your pathetic fucking Band-Aid.

¶ Oh, Los Angeles, be kind ¶

01:11:08.981 --> 01:11:12.216
You asked me
for an opportunity.

01:11:12.218 --> 01:11:15.152
I didn't have to give you
a chance, and I did,

01:11:15.154 --> 01:11:17.054
and now you're telling me
you have this great story

01:11:17.056 --> 01:11:19.923
and you can't write it?

01:11:19.925 --> 01:11:22.593
I guess
that's accurate, yeah.

01:11:22.595 --> 01:11:26.997
Huh. Okay.

01:11:26.999 --> 01:11:28.766
That's it?
You're not mad?

01:11:28.768 --> 01:11:30.067
Mad?
Fuck do I care?

01:11:30.069 --> 01:11:31.302
I've got two writers
out there

01:11:31.304 --> 01:11:33.037
who'd club a baby seal
for the job.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:35.072
Well, look,
I could write something else.

01:11:35.074 --> 01:11:36.507
I'd just need
a little bit more time.

01:11:36.509 --> 01:11:39.410
I make my decision
at the end of the week.

01:11:39.412 --> 01:11:41.078
Oh.

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:47.718
All right, well, uh,
thanks for the opportunity.

01:11:50.323 --> 01:11:53.190
Hey, it's none of my business,

01:11:53.192 --> 01:11:55.793
but when you came in here,
you were hungry.

01:11:55.795 --> 01:11:56.994
You were inspired.

01:11:56.996 --> 01:11:59.263
I mean,
you really wanted this job.

01:11:59.265 --> 01:12:01.865
It's, what, just not important
to you anymore?

01:12:01.867 --> 01:12:03.967
No, it still is.

01:12:03.969 --> 01:12:07.104
If you are a journalist,
you write.

01:12:07.106 --> 01:12:11.175
If you can do anything else,
you do anything else.

01:12:11.177 --> 01:12:13.210
If you're stuck,
go back to the heart.

01:12:13.212 --> 01:12:15.379
Go back to what inspired you
in the first place, you know,

01:12:15.381 --> 01:12:16.680
what really got you...

01:12:16.682 --> 01:12:17.848
Oh, I've got to take this.

Hi, any news?

01:12:21.287 --> 01:12:22.686

01:13:20.079 --> 01:13:21.712
I do call.
You don't pick up my calls.

to accept it,

to admit it,

01:13:37.229 --> 01:13:40.464
that I didn't think
I was capable.

01:13:40.466 --> 01:13:41.932
I know how much money's
in my wallet.

You've never needed that.

Victoria's a character

And tonight,
some schlepp of a guy

01:15:14.293 --> 01:15:16.426
will sit along the bar

buried in his phone
ordering vodka after vodka.

that tonight is his night,

01:15:26.238 --> 01:15:29.540
an escort named Victoria

tell him he can buy her a drink,

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:34.344
and blink
those beautiful blue eyes,

01:15:34.346 --> 01:15:39.283

he'll never let her slip away.

your institution tarnished

But your essay's the reason

01:16:18.223 --> 01:16:22.426
we're accepting you
into our MBA program.

01:16:24.597 --> 01:16:26.296

Your honesty about what happened
to you was refreshing.

Three of the five members

MBA candidate

You look good.

Oh.
Hi, son.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.492
Good exercising...

01:18:35.494 --> 01:18:39.629
Yeah, uh,
the whole exercise thing, yeah.

01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:44.801
Um, one of Emily's friend's
asshole father told Emily

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:47.370
that when you get over 50,
you got to work out every day,

01:18:47.372 --> 01:18:50.474
so she thinks
if I don't exercise, I die.

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:52.743
- It's crazy.
- Sounds crazy.

01:18:52.745 --> 01:18:56.913
So look, I got some more money
for you if you still need it.

01:18:56.915 --> 01:18:58.815
What happened to Krystal
and Mercury in retrograde?

01:18:58.817 --> 01:19:00.951
- She left me.
- You were dating.

01:19:00.953 --> 01:19:03.253
- My astrologer.
- Of course.

01:19:03.255 --> 01:19:05.722
Son, she was 35
and a Pilates instructor.

01:19:05.724 --> 01:19:09.893

Pilates does to a woman's ass?

01:19:09.895 --> 01:19:12.395
So how's Natalie?

01:19:12.397 --> 01:19:15.866
Or should I say...

01:19:15.868 --> 01:19:17.734
Victoria?

01:19:17.736 --> 01:19:20.971
I think it's a great article.
I'm proud of you.

01:19:20.973 --> 01:19:23.473
Where'd I put the thing?

01:19:23.475 --> 01:19:25.475
Here.

01:19:28.547 --> 01:19:30.147
Thank you.

01:19:33.285 --> 01:19:36.119
You know, I used to steal
your weed when I was a kid.

01:19:36.121 --> 01:19:37.888
Really?
That was you?

01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:39.256
I always thought
that was Rosalita.

01:19:39.258 --> 01:19:42.692
- No, it was me.
- Well, that's all right.

01:19:42.694 --> 01:19:44.427
It was your mom's weed.

01:19:44.429 --> 01:19:47.097
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Oh, yeah.

01:19:47.099 --> 01:19:49.599
I was on the straight
and narrow till she came along.

01:19:49.601 --> 01:19:53.203
So what about Natalie?

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:56.239
Ah, I fucked that up.

01:19:56.241 --> 01:19:58.542
Well, you need
to un-fuck that up.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:02.212
Look, if what you wrote
in this article is the truth,

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.713
then you can't
ignore your feelings.

01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:06.016
That regret is gonna
grow inside of you

01:20:06.018 --> 01:20:08.218
and twist you
into a dark and thorny place.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.823
I know, I've been there.
It's not good.

01:20:12.825 --> 01:20:14.124
Smoke some weed.

01:20:17.963 --> 01:20:20.330
So I've been thinking.

01:20:20.332 --> 01:20:22.532
I know you said I don't have
to play football next season,

01:20:22.534 --> 01:20:23.800
but I kind of want to.

01:20:23.802 --> 01:20:25.535
- Yeah, why is that?
- I don't know.

01:20:25.537 --> 01:20:30.340
I guess I don't mind the hitting
and all the yelling and stuff.

01:20:30.342 --> 01:20:32.609
What?

01:20:32.611 --> 01:20:34.444
- What?
- It's a boy.

01:20:34.446 --> 01:20:36.379
- It's definitely a boy.
- It's not a boy.

01:20:36.381 --> 01:20:38.014
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

01:20:38.016 --> 01:20:39.683
- It's not a boy.
- What's his name?

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:43.019
His name is Jonathan,
and he plays wide receiver,

01:20:43.021 --> 01:20:44.721
and he has the cutest ass
on the team.

01:20:44.723 --> 01:20:46.723
- Language.
- Sorry, butt.

01:20:47.726 --> 01:20:49.426
Do I even know this kid?

01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:51.428
Do you remember the guy
who scored all the touchdowns

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:52.429
at my games last year?

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:53.964
Wait, Jonathan?
Touchdown Jonathan?

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.566
- Yeah.
- He's pretty good.

01:20:56.568 --> 01:20:57.734
- I'll go get it.
- And I think he likes me.

01:20:57.736 --> 01:21:00.370
Ah, dear God.

01:21:08.647 --> 01:21:10.814
Hey.

01:21:10.816 --> 01:21:13.884
Hi.

01:21:13.886 --> 01:21:17.120
I read your article,
and, well,

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.955
I think you misquoted me.

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:21.358
Nobody even knows it's you,
just like you asked.

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.828
But there are some lines in here
I would have never said.

01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:26.796
Like what?

01:21:26.798 --> 01:21:28.465
"You see
enough unfaithful husbands,

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:33.403
"and you start to get sickened
by the whole notion of love.

01:21:33.405 --> 01:21:34.971
"How can you trust men
when you see them

01:21:34.973 --> 01:21:36.406
"call their wives
in front of you and say

01:21:36.408 --> 01:21:39.009
"they love them
after they just paid for sex?

01:21:39.011 --> 01:21:40.310
"I don't think
you can be in my industry

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:41.878
"and still believe in love.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.448
It's like being a scientist
and believing in God."

01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:47.984
Yeah, you definitely
said all of that.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:51.321
I'd really like you to publish
a retraction of that statement

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:56.126
and revise it to say, "You see
enough unfaithful husbands,

01:21:56.128 --> 01:22:00.096
"and you start
to question the notion of love,

01:22:00.098 --> 01:22:04.134
"and then when you finally
experience it for yourself,

01:22:04.136 --> 01:22:07.170
"you see
what all the fuss is about,

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:11.541
"and you can't imagine not
having that person in your life,

01:22:11.543 --> 01:22:14.110
"and you feel like the luckiest
person in the world,

01:22:14.112 --> 01:22:15.712
"and you would do anything
to make them

01:22:15.714 --> 01:22:18.381
feel the same way
about you."

01:22:24.589 --> 01:22:26.456
I quit.

01:22:28.593 --> 01:22:32.696
I'm officially a grad student
in September.

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:37.867
Get an MBA and make this
tutoring thing a real business.

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:40.070
I'll have to pay taxes.

01:22:40.072 --> 01:22:42.205
Well, that's...that's good.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:45.442
That's...that's really good
for you.

01:22:45.444 --> 01:22:47.310
I'm happy for you.

01:22:50.515 --> 01:22:52.382
Yeah.

01:22:57.322 --> 01:22:58.955
Okay.

01:23:02.894 --> 01:23:04.928
Wait.

01:23:21.613 --> 01:23:24.247
Yeah, over my dead body.
