[Black Hood]
This is the Black Hood.

00:12.429 --> 00:15.140
-I want to cleanse Riverdale of sinners.
-No.

00:17.183 --> 00:19.269
Mr. Svenson, you scared me.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.521
I mean, really, Mom.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.691
You talk trash about the Serpents,
when you were one.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.152
-FP had a little accident.
-What can we do?

00:27.235 --> 00:30.613
[Penny] Pick up a crate on the Southside,
deliver it to an address in Greendale.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.533
You don't wanna be in bed
with the Snake Charmer.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.119
And if Penny Peabody reaches out,
don't respond.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.621
No. You said that this was gonna
be a one-and-done.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.457
And I am just getting started with you.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.542
[Jughead] The Riverdale Reaper
is the Black Hood?

00:42.625 --> 00:46.212
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was the same man.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.715
There was a family living out
near Fox Forest.

00:48.798 --> 00:51.176
Someone broke in, shot them all dead.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.345
Some say he never left Riverdale.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.934
[Jughead]  Like the Red Death showing up
in an Edgar Allan Poe story,

01:00.018 --> 01:02.228
the Black Hood had come to Riverdale.

01:02.645 --> 01:06.483
With that grimmest of reapers
looming over us, how did we cope?

01:07.358 --> 01:09.486
In the case of Archie and Veronica...

01:10.195 --> 01:12.155
it was through carnal defiance.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.116
Ugh. Get a room, Xenomorphs.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.828
[Jughead]  With every kiss and embrace,
they seemed to be saying:

01:18.912 --> 01:21.372
"You have no power over me, Death."

01:22.540 --> 01:25.543
In fact, Varchie became
the opposite of death.

[Jughead]  Even in The Pembrooke.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.778
After all, if our young lovers dared
to defy the Black Hood,

01:51.945 --> 01:54.739
why not risk Hiram Lodge's wrath as well?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.866

01:57.700 --> 01:59.035
-Hey.
-Hmm?

01:59.994 --> 02:02.455
Are you sure your parents aren't gonna
come back any time soon?

02:02.539 --> 02:03.915
What if they catch us like this?

02:04.082 --> 02:07.335
The tasting menu at Pourquoi
is 13 courses, Archie.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.712
We have hours yet.

02:10.338 --> 02:11.381
[chuckles]

02:12.423 --> 02:16.344
What? You've always wanted
to make it in front of a roaring fire?

02:16.427 --> 02:18.388

02:18.471 --> 02:20.807
No, just-- I love you, Ronnie.

[Archie clearing throat]

02:26.813 --> 02:29.107

-I wonder what's on HBO.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.067
I should go, on the chance
your parents come back.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.111
Yeah, or at the minimum,
we should get dressed.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.073
I'm gonna go. I have to do this thing.

02:37.157 --> 02:37.991
I'll text you.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.534
Archie.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.371
This was, as always, amazing.

Sorry, there's no service

What did you find? Any truth
to what that creepy truck driver said

03:02.390 --> 03:03.892
about that murdered family?

03:03.975 --> 03:07.270
Yes. Shockingly,
Freddy Krueger didn't lie to me.

03:07.353 --> 03:11.733
A family of four was murdered by someone
the press called the Riverdale Reaper.

03:11.816 --> 03:15.528
The victims were Jim
and Mary Ellen Conway and their kids.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.530
Tommy was 10 and Sue was 9.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.700
The Reaper was never caught or identified,
so he could be our Black Hood.

03:20.783 --> 03:23.369
But I'm dubious.
He would be in his 60s by now.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.580
Why did he do it? Kill them?

03:25.747 --> 03:28.374
The reporter of the article talked
to a sheriff at the time,

03:28.458 --> 03:32.629
who thought the killer chose at random
or because their house was isolated.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.506
-Where was it?
-Edge of Fox Forest down a service road.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.383
Here. There's a picture of it.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.391
Oh, my God.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.978
Jughead, I've been to this house.

03:49.103 --> 03:52.732
The Black Hood sent me to it
as part of his game.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.652
Well, then, there's definitely a link
between the Hood and the Reaper.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.862
We should talk to Keller,
pull files from the murders.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.489
At least get a list of all the players.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.532
No, I can't go to Sheriff Keller.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.661
Not after I accused him
of being the Black Hood.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.330
Right. Yeah, that would be awkward.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.751
-We could go to the house.
-I can't go back there, Jug.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.170
He made me look in a mirror,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.714
and what I saw staring back at me,
I don't wanna do that again.

04:16.798 --> 04:17.715

04:35.316 --> 04:37.151
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.570
So, the reason
we called you guys in here--

04:39.654 --> 04:41.322
My dad is getting out of jail.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.951
-Jug, that's great.
-[Veronica] Yeah.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.370
What heralded this miracle?

04:49.289 --> 04:53.835
Uh... Overcrowding at the jail.
I guess the judge reviewed my dad's case,

04:53.918 --> 04:57.588
and after Cheryl's testimony,
it was a perfect storm.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.133
-What do you need from us, Jug?
-[Betty] Both of us.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.468
We have a new lead on the Black Hood case.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.888
And Jughead and I were wondering
if you guys would follow up on it for us.

05:05.972 --> 05:10.101
We can give you all of the details,
the articles.

05:10.184 --> 05:13.479
It's just that I have to be there for
my dad, to help with his re-entry, so...

05:13.563 --> 05:17.108
Uh, yeah, and I'm just taking a break
from the Black Hood.

05:18.484 --> 05:24.032
Wait, so, you want us to be... you guys?

05:24.115 --> 05:25.616
Essentially, yes.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.746
What, is there a problem with that?

05:36.044 --> 05:39.338
Oh, my God. Josie, your back.
It's like a sailor's rope.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.383
-What?
-All those tension knots.

05:42.467 --> 05:47.096
Luckily, I just picked up a new bottle
of lavender essential oil. Turn around.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.223
Uh, okay.

-No, it's okay, Mr. Svenson.
-Oh, my God, Josie, it's so not okay.

Take your male gaze and male privilege
and get out of the women's locker room.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.576
Of course, my apologies.
I should have knocked.

and investigated, the Peeping Tom.

-Sheriff Keller.
-Veronica.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.307
What was he doing here?

06:32.600 --> 06:36.104
The shadow of the Black Hood
has finally landed on our home.

06:36.687 --> 06:37.939
We received a letter.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.024
What? What did it say?

06:40.108 --> 06:44.028
The usual. That we'll be targeted
and punished for our sinful ways.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.823
Well, don't let it ruin your day.

06:46.906 --> 06:51.410
According to Keller, dozens of households
received the exact same letter.

06:51.494 --> 06:55.081
I don't know about those other people,
but we're actually sinners.

06:56.165 --> 07:00.253
The Pembrooke is a fortress.
And Andre is trained in the martial arts.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.713
What about when I go to school,
or shopping?

07:02.797 --> 07:05.800
He'll drive you. If he's not available,
we'll hire a car service.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.302
[Hermione]
Also, your father and I have talked,

07:08.386 --> 07:11.013
and we wouldn't mind
seeing more of Archie.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.433
He's brawny and devoted to you.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.567
[cell phone beeps]

07:30.199 --> 07:32.994
Wait, uh, Mom. Before you leave,
I wanted to ask

07:33.077 --> 07:34.871
if I could borrow
the station wagon tomorrow.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.916
-Why?
-FP's getting released from jail.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.669
So, Jughead and I were gonna
pick him up and treat him to Pop's.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.504
They're letting FP out?

07:43.588 --> 07:46.340
And you're gonna hear it eventually,
so it might as well be from me.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.009
Don't freak out.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.136
Jughead is a Serpent now.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.096
-Officially.
-Betty.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.433
I wish I could say I was surprised.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.811
Jughead is important to me.
FP is important to Jughead.

07:58.895 --> 08:03.858
So, I'm asking, Mom, will you try
to give him the benefit of the doubt?

08:04.108 --> 08:05.067
For me?

08:06.277 --> 08:09.447
I have an announcement to make.
My dad's getting out.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.491
Yeah.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.537
When he does, I'll bring him up to speed
about our plans with Mayor McCoy.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.247
[Tall Boy] That's brilliant.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.959
-You have a problem with that, Tall Boy?
-Your old man?

08:22.793 --> 08:23.920
No.

08:24.462 --> 08:28.674
I got no problem with him. But you want us
to sit down with the mayor.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.760
I do. He's right.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.889
I think we can bring the Southside back.
But it's gonna take work.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.683
And it's going to take compromise.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.519
[Tall Boy]
We can bring the Southside back.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.063
-You've been here all five minutes.
-[Jughead] Tall Boy,

08:42.146 --> 08:45.066
I am sick of you acting
like a little bitch,

08:45.191 --> 08:49.612
whispering behind my back that I'm half
a Serpent or that I don't belong here.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.988
Why don't we put it to a vote?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.699
If you guys think
what I'm doing is wrong, I'll step aside.

08:54.742 --> 08:59.372
All those who stand with Jughead and think
Tall Boy should shut the hell up?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.137
-[Veronica] My parents are in their room.
-Good.

09:25.022 --> 09:28.526
That thing Betty and Jughead asked us
to do, investigate the murder house?

09:29.110 --> 09:30.820
-I wanna do it.
-Yeah, me, too.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.990
My parents got a threatening letter.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.992
-What? From the Black Hood?
-Maybe.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.411
Or maybe it was somebody
pretending to be the Black Hood.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.328
Ronnie.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.250
Are we good?

09:44.375 --> 09:45.501
Don't stop, Archie.

09:46.836 --> 09:47.795
I don't want to.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.091
Can we talk about what I said?

09:52.174 --> 09:56.262
Archie, I wanna be with you,
and you wanna be with me.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.264
Can't that be enough for right now?

09:58.848 --> 10:00.474
While we focus on the case?

10:15.197 --> 10:17.992
What's wrong, Archie?
Something you wanna get off your chest?

10:18.075 --> 10:19.493
[sighs] Yeah, actually.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.498
Me and Ronnie are in a weird place.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.250
Things have been pretty intense lately.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.919
Something weird happened with Archie.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.257
Well, to be honest, I'm not sure
if it even really happened...

10:34.050 --> 10:38.387
but he may or may not have
said the L-word to me?

10:39.055 --> 10:42.433
I said "I love you" to her, Dad.
[scoffs]

10:42.516 --> 10:45.478
And she didn't say it back.
And yes, she heard me.

10:45.561 --> 10:49.565
Which, if he did,
I think it's... too soon.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.359
Don't you guys agree?

10:51.442 --> 10:53.778
I wouldn't get too in your head
about that, son.

10:54.695 --> 10:57.907
Those words,
people are often on different schedules.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.661
-It doesn't matter what Archie said.
-Or didn't say. That's my preference.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.538
It's about whether or not
you're ready to hear it.

-Is it true what they say about men

11:28.270 --> 11:29.980
who have just been released
from prison, FP?

11:30.689 --> 11:34.110
-What do they say?
-They're incredibly sexually frustrated.

-Mom. What?
-Wow.

11:52.002 --> 11:56.173
The Black Hood is targeting sinners,
so I'd watch my back if I were you, FP.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.468
Especially once you rejoin
that gang of hoodlums.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.388
-Serpents aren't hoodlum--
-I'm not going back to the Serpents.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.641
I thought a lot about this
while I was in Shankshaw,

12:05.724 --> 12:07.435
and I'm done with Serpent life.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.603
It's gonna be one last ride
for my boy and I,

12:09.687 --> 12:12.523
but it's too much
of a slippery slope for me.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.942
-The Serpents need you, Dad.
-Jughead needs you, Mr. Jones.

12:15.025 --> 12:19.029
And what, pray tell, will you be doing
with all of your extra time, FP?

12:19.113 --> 12:22.825
Working, Warden Cooper.
I saw a "help wanted" sign in the window.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.494
Thought I'd talk to Pop
about picking up some shifts.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.956
Let's hope your plans don't come crashing
down once you start drinking again.

12:29.039 --> 12:33.794
Actually, I'm in AA. Started in jail,
and I don't plan on stopping.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.920
Mm.

[chuckles]

12:39.091 --> 12:39.925
[Archie]  Sheriff.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.011
We wanted to talk to you
about a cold case.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.222
About a family murdered
in Fox Forest 40 years ago.

12:45.306 --> 12:48.058
Your receptionist said
the files were missing.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.519
Is it possible they were stolen
as part of a cover-up?

12:50.603 --> 12:53.731
Now, now, hold on.
Sometimes with cold cases,

12:53.814 --> 12:57.109
the lead officer will take the files home
so they can keep working on them.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.653
Who would have been
the lead officer on this case?

12:59.737 --> 13:03.407
Back then? Multiple homicide?
My guess would be Sheriff Howard.

13:03.491 --> 13:07.161
-Do you know where he is?
-Sheriff Howard died two years ago.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.497
But his daughter still lives
in town here. Margaret.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.041
I've got her contact information.
Maybe she can help you.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.251
[Veronica]
My name is Veronica Lodge.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.129
I'm calling about one
of your father's cases.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.464
The Conway murders.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.925
[Maggie over phone]
Here we go again. What about them?

13:21.008 --> 13:23.886
My colleague and I are writing
a retrospective on the murders,

13:23.969 --> 13:25.429
and we were wondering--

13:25.513 --> 13:27.139
My dad was obsessed with the killings.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.434
He called the house
where they happened the devil's house.

13:30.518 --> 13:34.813
He'd go to that place day and night,
for hours, trying to put pieces together.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.900
If you ask me,
my father lost his mind in that house.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.111
Now, I'm done talking about this.
Don't call me again.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.279
[phone hangs up]

13:43.113 --> 13:44.490
-Ronnie.
-Don't say it.

13:44.573 --> 13:47.409
-We have to go to that house.
-The devil's house?

13:48.869 --> 13:49.954
What if he's home?

13:53.999 --> 13:55.501
[rock music playing]

14:20.860 --> 14:22.945
Things got ugly when you were away.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.907
I asked myself every day
what you would do if you were here.

14:28.033 --> 14:32.329
Has Penny bothered you? I figured
she's the one who greased my wheels.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.332
I did a job for her.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.667
What kind of job?

14:36.750 --> 14:41.171
It was a one-time thing. I figured it best
not to ask too many questions.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.466
We're squared away, for good.

14:46.635 --> 14:51.223
You know, when I was 16, my old man
kicked me out and told me to go to hell.

14:51.515 --> 14:56.604
Instead, I joined the Serpents.
And then the Army, and then back again.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.232
I don't want that life for you.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.361
I want you to go to college,
get out of this godforsaken town.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.654
I ran the gauntlet.

15:06.614 --> 15:10.242
I fought with the Serpents, and for them.
I have to stay.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.121
I wanna stay.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.916
But I need your blessing.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.464
-Just promise me you'll keep writing.
-I will.

15:25.049 --> 15:25.966
I do every day.

15:30.888 --> 15:31.889
[FP sighs]

15:45.736 --> 15:47.947
-You all finished?
-Yeah. Thanks, Dad.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.991
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.160
-[Cheryl] Josie.
-[Josie] Yeah.

15:53.243 --> 15:57.122
Playing a car dealership opening
is barely a step above amateur porn.

15:57.206 --> 16:03.003
Reggie is texting me that his dad
is gonna pay me $5000 for five songs.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.297
As long as he gets to escort me.

16:13.889 --> 16:17.267
Clean that up, plebe.
The way you did my brother's blood.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.604
Jug, don't.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.778
I'll get you another milkshake.
On the house.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.041
My dad used to be a king, a leader of men.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.293
Now he's being demeaned
by the likes of Cheryl Blossom?

16:44.586 --> 16:47.006
He deserves to be honored,
not humiliated.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.009
-[scoffs]
-So, why don't we do just that?

16:50.592 --> 16:55.180
Seriously? Why not throw your dad
a retirement party, fit for a king?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.766
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.857
You have a stage. Would you be open to me
bringing in a karaoke machine?

17:04.940 --> 17:06.400
For FP's retirement?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.318
Sure, why not.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.071
Also, Toni, one of the reasons
I wanted to talk to you,

17:11.155 --> 17:13.032
beyond the party planning is...

17:13.907 --> 17:17.578
I've been walking the razor's edge
since Jughead joined the Serpents.

17:17.661 --> 17:22.458
And all I've been thinking is as soon as
FP gets home, everything will get better,

17:22.541 --> 17:26.253
because he'll be there to protect Jughead
and make sure he doesn't get hurt.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.006
Yeah, I'm following you.
I mean, with FP out of the picture--

17:29.089 --> 17:31.717
That's my whole point. I do worry.

17:33.218 --> 17:37.347
So, I wanna keep an eye on Jughead myself.

17:38.974 --> 17:42.895
Make sure that as deep into these
snake-infested waters as he goes,

17:43.395 --> 17:47.066
he doesn't do something that,
you know, puts him in danger.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.277
So, what, you wanna be a Serpent?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.615
Let's say Serpent-adjacent.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.827
But yeah, a part of his world, this world.

17:59.661 --> 18:00.746
[Byrdie laughing]

18:01.413 --> 18:02.915
Shut it, Byrdie.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.375
Sorry, Sweet Valley High.

18:05.459 --> 18:10.089
If you wanna join the club, you gotta do
the dance. The Serpent Dance.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.007
Excuse me, Serpent Dance?

18:12.091 --> 18:14.718
It's some outdated,
sexist Serpent tradition.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.888
I tried to get it outlawed,
but misogyny dies hard.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.849
You don't wanna know.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.435
Yeah, I do.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.647
I wanna know everything.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.689
[rock music playing]

18:34.238 --> 18:37.157
A party? No. No, no, no.

18:37.241 --> 18:41.078
The problem is, I'm trying to keep the
Serpents in my rearview mirror, remember?

18:41.161 --> 18:42.579
It's one night.

18:42.663 --> 18:46.667
Not even. It's like, three hours.
You've done right by the Serpents.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.253
More than right. Let them do right by you.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.923
Come on, it's the end of an era.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.133
[sighs]

18:55.217 --> 18:56.051
Okay.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.220
-Okay, let's do it.
-Great.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.264
[cell phone buzzing]

19:01.014 --> 19:04.017
It's Archie. Don't bogart the egg rolls.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.939
-The hell do you want, Penny?
-[Penny]  We have business.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.357
How fast can you get to Pop's?

19:10.440 --> 19:13.152
No. No, I told you I'm out, that I'm done.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.572
Don't keep me waiting long, little doggie,
or I'll have your father back behind bars

19:16.655 --> 19:18.240
before I finish my cup of burnt coffee.

19:21.368 --> 19:24.496
I won't be held hostage by you.
I did my one favor. I'm out.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.749
No, no. You have debts to pay.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.127
And ours is an ongoing arrangement.

19:30.210 --> 19:34.339
You know what, Penny? I'm about to have
a sit-down with Mayor McCoy.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.758
She's not really so big
on the whole drug-dealing thing.

19:36.842 --> 19:40.637
I'm sure that she would love to know who
took over Clifford Blossom's operation.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.640
You'd need proof
to make an accusation like that stick.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.519
Like the video I have of you and your pal
making that delivery.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.937
What do you think of that?

19:49.021 --> 19:51.857
I think that an attack against me,
or my father,

19:52.441 --> 19:54.860
is an attack against all of the Serpents.

19:55.444 --> 19:59.239
And not even some fuzzy footage
of me delivering a crate

19:59.323 --> 20:01.325
is going to stop us from coming for you.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.453
Your girlfriend.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.457
Betty Cooper, I believe?

20:10.417 --> 20:11.668
She's quite fetching.

20:15.714 --> 20:16.840
What did you say?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.343
All snakes have a soft underbelly.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.055
She's yours. Am I right?

20:31.897 --> 20:35.025
Now I'm regretting throwing your gun
in Sweetwater River.

20:35.192 --> 20:39.529
If Sheriff Howard kept coming back here,
there must be a reason why.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.949
Something that didn't, or doesn't, add up.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.869
So, what does the article say happened?

20:45.953 --> 20:50.499
The Reaper came at night, when the rest
of the town was getting ready for bed.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.835
[gun cocks]

21:00.259 --> 21:02.135
[man on TV]  ...were a sharp surprise.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.973
He killed the mother,
Mary Ellen Conway, first.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.810
Maybe over there.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.039
He killed the father, Jim Conway,
in the kitchen.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.129
He was rushing to save his wife.

21:42.050 --> 21:44.261
He was shot point-blank in the chest.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.430
The kids were still in their bedrooms.

21:46.972 --> 21:47.806
Hiding.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.100
My God, Archie.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.529
[Archie]  They were hiding under the bed.

22:04.614 --> 22:05.991
[gunshot]

22:27.220 --> 22:30.891
Archie? It was a family of four
that was killed, right?

22:30.974 --> 22:31.975
Yeah, why?

22:32.059 --> 22:35.103
[Veronica] There's something weird here.
Three sets of initials.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.661
These are Sheriff Howard's files.
His notes.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.955
He kept them here so he could keep
working on the case.

22:55.040 --> 22:59.711
Does it say anything about a third child?
With the letters J and C?

23:01.296 --> 23:02.547
Wait, turn that back.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.135
Oh, my God, Archie. There.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.889
The Conways were a family of five.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.230
[rock music playing]

23:18.313 --> 23:20.857
Why so sad?
It's great news about your dad.

23:23.193 --> 23:25.779
I guess that means
the Snake Charmer came through.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.784
What? She hasn't called you
for any more favors, has she?

23:30.867 --> 23:35.080
That deal was a favor. My one favor.
Technically, I don't owe her anything.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.999
Oh, Jones. Let's hope you're right.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.170
It's no problem, we can pick the trays up.

23:42.796 --> 23:45.132
Thanks, Pop. Sorry for the short notice.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.509
-Bye.
-Trays for what?

23:49.094 --> 23:52.222
Juggy is throwing a retirement party
for FP at the Whyte Wyrm.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.015
And I'm helping him organize.

23:54.099 --> 23:58.979
Before you object, Mom,
need I remind you, you were a Serpent.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.066
-Betty won't listen, so I'm telling you,
-Alice--

24:03.150 --> 24:05.110
if she thinks about putting on
a Serpent jacket,

24:05.193 --> 24:06.528
-I'll have your head.
-I'm working.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.405
I won't have our kids
make mistakes we did.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.531
They weren't all mistakes.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.741
If you're worried, come to the party.
Chaperone her.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.411
-Are you high on fumes? I can't.
-Yes, you can.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.913
Stop by. Say hi to some old friends.

24:16.997 --> 24:17.914
[sighs]

24:18.498 --> 24:20.292
-Hal would never come.
-Well, then, leave him.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.420
At home.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.677
So, the real story
was in the sheriff's notebook.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.681
There was a third child, Joseph Conway,
who survived the massacre.

24:34.764 --> 24:38.268
They hid his identity, changed his name,
so he could lead a normal life.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.187
-Yeah.
-[Veronica] According to Howard's notes,

24:40.270 --> 24:42.647
he was adopted by another family
in Riverdale,

24:42.731 --> 24:45.817
and presumably
enrolled at a local high school.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.110
We got a picture of the kid.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.406
If we match that boy to one
of the students at Riverdale High

24:51.489 --> 24:53.116
during the years he would've attended--

24:53.200 --> 24:56.286
He might be able to tell us how the
murders are connected to the Black Hood.

24:56.369 --> 24:57.787
Or he is the Black Hood.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.665
Just go with me here.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.793
Let's say that our mystery kid
did end up surviving the slaughter,

25:03.877 --> 25:06.421
maybe he even saw it.
It would've messed him up for life.

25:06.504 --> 25:10.008
And somehow, he could be blaming the town
for what happened.

25:10.091 --> 25:11.927
And now is punishing us for it.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.597
So, we have to go through
all these yearbooks, page by page,

25:15.680 --> 25:18.767
and see if we find a match,
so not quite a needle in a haystack.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.061
What?

25:21.144 --> 25:23.438
Uh, we have to get ready
for a party that we're hosting.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.774
It's my dad's retirement party, so...

25:26.441 --> 25:27.442
[both] Oh.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.444
-No, you guys should come.
-[Jughead] I-- I--

25:29.527 --> 25:32.405
-If you don't want to, you don't have to.
-I'm renting a karaoke machine.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.698
It's not a big deal.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.326
-You should come. You guys should come.
-If you want.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.254
-Can we take a break and talk about--?
-Oh, my God.

25:47.629 --> 25:48.672
Is that him?

25:51.258 --> 25:52.259
Could be, yeah.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.188
Mr. Svenson.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.106
Yes?

26:07.357 --> 26:09.985
We know who you are, Joseph Conway.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.529
Hey!

26:13.071 --> 26:13.905
Hey.

26:17.659 --> 26:19.452
Why did you run, Mr. Svenson?

26:20.161 --> 26:24.040
I got scared. No one's called me
Joe Conway in decades.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.960
We read about your family.
We know you're the only one that survived.

26:27.043 --> 26:30.338
-If you've been tempted to find justice--
-I found justice.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.841
-What do you mean?
-The night it happened.

26:34.467 --> 26:38.930
I heard gunshots,
and I escaped out of my bedroom window.

26:39.973 --> 26:42.517
I could've run into the woods,
but I didn't.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.770
I wanted to see him leave my house.

26:46.604 --> 26:49.149
I saw him covered in my family's blood.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.192
I saw his face.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.696
You know who killed your family?

26:54.779 --> 26:58.033
A con man.
A preacher passing through town.

26:58.616 --> 27:02.537
Next day, a group of men took me
to the motel where he was staying.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.372
I pointed him out.

27:06.499 --> 27:09.669
They took him away... and they killed him.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.254
I'm not sure how.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.341
-What happened to the men who did that?
-Nothing.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.801

Where were you the morning
Fred Andrews was shot?

27:32.108 --> 27:34.235
-Ronnie.
-And the night Miss Grundy was killed?

27:34.319 --> 27:37.072
-Moose and Midge, and the Sugarman?
-Ronnie. Ronnie, that's enough.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.036

It's not him.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.539

28:27.622 --> 28:29.666
I wanted to ask how things
are with you and Archie.

28:29.749 --> 28:32.502
We've been working on this side project

28:33.044 --> 28:37.715
and I'm realizing that one of the reasons
I threw myself into it

28:37.799 --> 28:41.761
was to avoid talking about the love
that dares not speak its name.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.973
Why can't I say it, Mom?

28:45.515 --> 28:48.601
Why does it have to be such a big deal?
I mean, you and daddy never say it.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.687
I mean, I don't think
I've ever heard you say it...

28:52.397 --> 28:53.231
once.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.153

29:01.698 --> 29:04.159
-No, I'm just gonna meet her there.
-Oh.

29:06.035 --> 29:10.749
So, I take it things didn't go so well
on the other side of the four-letter word.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.625
When I'm with Veronica,

29:12.709 --> 29:15.712

and they've been getting pretty dark...

29:16.463 --> 29:19.716

like everything's gonna be fine.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.259

29:21.968 --> 29:24.554
-I don't wanna lose that.
-You won't.

29:25.096 --> 29:28.224
You just gotta give her a little time.
A little space.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.977

You know what? I've been in and out of the
Serpents since I was younger than my son.

the Serpents stuck by my side

turned their backs on me.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.548
