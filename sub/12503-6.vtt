WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:04.502
You and someone had a kid.

00:04.503 --> 00:05.629
You gave up that kid.

00:05.630 --> 00:08.939
I am that kid, and now
I'm applying for emancipation.

00:08.940 --> 00:10.412
Cate Cassidy. That's your mom.

00:10.413 --> 00:11.607
I am Cate Cassidy.

00:11.608 --> 00:13.766
Ryan and I have been up since 5:00.

00:13.767 --> 00:16.222
And as usual arguing since 6:00.

00:16.222 --> 00:18.304
I am not granting you emancipation.

00:18.305 --> 00:22.542
I'm releasing you back into
their temporary joint custody.

00:22.543 --> 00:23.942
I needed this.

00:24.776 --> 00:27.011
I see you've met Mr. Daniels.

00:27.377 --> 00:28.783
- You're a...
- Teacher.

00:30.873 --> 00:31.870
Eric?

00:32.049 --> 00:33.817
I'm your new tutor.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.440
Uh, Lux.

00:37.441 --> 00:38.602
Uh, you've met Eric, right?

00:38.603 --> 00:39.181
Oh!

00:39.288 --> 00:40.412
Mr. Daniels.

00:40.589 --> 00:41.852
Yeah, we know each other.

00:41.853 --> 00:43.657
You guys know each other?

00:43.658 --> 00:45.205
Paige is my aunt.

00:48.042 --> 00:48.984
You're late.

00:48.985 --> 00:50.980
I'd also like to remind you

00:50.981 --> 00:53.128
that you're no longer
working in a bar anymore.

00:53.129 --> 00:55.219
So... Define "crazy in bed".

00:55.220 --> 00:56.162
- No.
- Come on.

00:56.163 --> 00:57.988
Seriously. Because I think
you and I, the two of us,

00:57.989 --> 00:59.528
we could be highly compatible.

00:59.529 --> 01:00.736
You so wish.

01:00.737 --> 01:02.082
What if there is a part of me

01:02.083 --> 01:03.908
that is in love with you, too?

01:03.909 --> 01:05.602
I'm not in love with you.

01:05.603 --> 01:07.145
And now by the powers

01:07.146 --> 01:09.667
vested in me, I pronounce you

01:09.668 --> 01:11.846
husband and wife.

01:17.053 --> 01:18.464
Who's Julia?

01:18.465 --> 01:20.396
Um, I don't know.

01:20.397 --> 01:22.489
Friend of my parents, I think.

01:24.457 --> 01:26.718
Julia, you don't need to apologize.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.694
The wedding happened.
SheÂ›never knew anything was wrong.

01:28.695 --> 01:30.557
It's over. It's done. Bye.

01:51.984 --> 01:52.843
Oh.

01:54.408 --> 01:55.297
Hey.

01:57.085 --> 01:59.836
Sorry. Paige thought
that you slept at Cate's.

01:59.837 --> 02:01.586
I wish I had.

02:02.746 --> 02:04.835
Shower curtains for walls.

02:04.836 --> 02:07.101
It's not exactly sound-proof.

02:10.228 --> 02:11.995
Lux, I'm sorry.

02:12.970 --> 02:14.195
I thought that...

02:22.252 --> 02:23.623
Good morning.

02:23.624 --> 02:24.626
I hope I'm not interrupting.

02:24.627 --> 02:26.886
Coffee, black. And hold my calls.

02:26.887 --> 02:28.729
Right. Now, before I get that...

02:28.730 --> 02:30.081
You got a minute?

02:30.082 --> 02:33.641
I, um... I made you this.

02:33.642 --> 02:36.175
It's a little mix CD.
I'm kind of known for them.

02:36.176 --> 02:38.363
Uh, it's got a lot of
music from the concert

02:38.364 --> 02:39.925
that I think you'd like.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.187
Nate, we're not stuck at
some coachella knock-off.

02:42.188 --> 02:44.247
This is the office, and I'm your boss.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.204
Right, I know. But I was just...

02:45.205 --> 02:45.819
I was thinking, maybe...

02:45.820 --> 02:47.688
Have you audited the reported to ROI

02:47.689 --> 02:49.803
on the Fenmore Biotech 4 fund yet?

02:50.550 --> 02:51.550
Uh, yes.

02:51.551 --> 02:54.033
Yes, I'm through the first
four months of the year.

02:54.034 --> 02:55.370
Working on getting the
rest of the numbers.

02:55.371 --> 02:56.038
Good.

02:56.039 --> 02:57.949
And don't forget I need
a copy of my itinerary

02:57.950 --> 02:59.961
for the company retreat this weekend.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.920
The retreat? Right. Hey.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.443
Crazy idea.

03:04.444 --> 03:06.174
How about when you get back, we can...

03:06.175 --> 03:07.475
None of these documents are signed.

03:07.476 --> 03:09.511
Get Tom from accounting down here.

03:11.467 --> 03:13.445
Tom from accounting. Right.

03:20.840 --> 03:21.417
Hey.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.249
Hey.

03:22.690 --> 03:24.027
All right. I got your 711 text.

03:24.028 --> 03:26.082
I cannot remember if that's
our code for "hurry home"

03:26.083 --> 03:28.082
or "get some milk".
What's going on?

03:28.083 --> 03:29.790
We're going on a staycation.

03:29.791 --> 03:31.127
Okay, I don't think that's a real word.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.176
Yes, it is. You know?
Staycation, a vacation

03:33.177 --> 03:34.820
where you stay in town.

03:34.821 --> 03:35.961
Look, the Carlow hotel,

03:35.962 --> 03:37.832
they just opened in
Portland and I figure

03:37.833 --> 03:39.594
that we could try it
out for the weekend.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.894
You mean, like, leave right
this minute, try it out?

03:41.895 --> 03:45.572
Why not? We never went
on a real honeymoon alone

03:45.573 --> 03:48.418
after the wedding and,
you know, with work,

03:48.419 --> 03:51.024
a weekend is all either
one of us can take.

03:51.025 --> 03:52.472
Plus, you know,

03:52.473 --> 03:54.124
we're trying to have a baby.

03:54.809 --> 03:55.881
Right? There's a major amount

03:55.882 --> 03:58.152
of uninterrupted

03:58.153 --> 04:00.348
we could spend the next 48 hours in bed.

04:00.349 --> 04:01.243
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

04:03.194 --> 04:04.038
I'm in.

04:04.039 --> 04:05.879
All right. Good.
Uh, you change your clothes.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.870
I will meet you in the car.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.683
I have already packed your bag.

04:08.684 --> 04:10.925
Hey. You're good.

04:14.666 --> 04:16.600
Hey. Um, I can't really talk,

04:16.601 --> 04:17.793
unless it's about Lux.

04:17.793 --> 04:20.997
I am leaving in two
minutes for my staycation.

04:20.998 --> 04:22.258
Is that a real word?

04:22.259 --> 04:23.429
Yes.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.785
Okay, well...

04:24.786 --> 04:26.848
This is weird and a little awkward.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.405
But, uh, you know, given...

04:29.127 --> 04:30.468
everything, um...

04:30.469 --> 04:31.976
But I can't talk to the guys about this,

04:31.977 --> 04:34.247
- and I need your advice.
- Okay.

04:34.248 --> 04:35.925
You remember Emma?
Slightly uptight.

04:35.926 --> 04:37.309
A little neurotic. A lot like you.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.505
All right, get to the point.

04:38.506 --> 04:41.569
Yeah, well, I thought at the
concert that we kind of bonded.

04:41.570 --> 04:43.575
But now she's mean. Unlike you.

04:43.576 --> 04:45.788
You're nice and helpful and nice.

04:45.789 --> 04:49.138
Well, you are at work,
and she is your boss.

04:49.139 --> 04:50.594
That's what she said.

04:50.595 --> 04:52.218
It's scary how alike you are.

04:52.219 --> 04:54.056
Look, just find some time alone

04:54.057 --> 04:55.883
with her away from the office.

04:55.884 --> 04:57.201
Yeah, well, I tried, but she's leaving

04:57.202 --> 04:58.487
for a company retreat this weekend.

04:58.488 --> 04:59.425
A retreat?

04:59.426 --> 05:00.562
No, no, that is perfect.

05:00.563 --> 05:02.215
- You got to get in on that.
- Okay.

05:02.216 --> 05:04.504
There is alcohol, there
is expense accounts,

05:04.505 --> 05:05.980
there is room service.

05:06.702 --> 05:07.872
Alcohol.

05:07.873 --> 05:09.806
I love all those things.

05:09.807 --> 05:12.017
You know, the first time
that Ryan and I had sex

05:12.018 --> 05:13.543
was at a company retreat.

05:13.544 --> 05:15.642
Yep, kind of awkward.

05:16.264 --> 05:17.548
But thanks.

05:17.549 --> 05:18.777
I got to go.

05:22.132 --> 05:22.941
Hey, dad.

05:22.942 --> 05:24.885
- Morning, Nate. Emma in?
- Yeah, yeah.

05:24.886 --> 05:27.011
But, hey, can I... can I
talk to you for a second?

05:27.012 --> 05:27.931
Shoot.

05:27.932 --> 05:30.931
The whole company retreat
that's happening this weekend,

05:30.932 --> 05:33.035
do you mind if I tag along?

05:33.863 --> 05:34.909
I'm just... I'm... I'm...

05:34.910 --> 05:36.375
I feel like I'm kind of
playing catch up compared to

05:36.376 --> 05:39.007
everyone else around
here, and, you know,

05:39.008 --> 05:41.998
I just, I want to do the
best job possible, you know?

05:42.472 --> 05:43.878
You know what?

05:43.879 --> 05:45.475
You absolutely should come.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.223
Way to take initiative, Nate.

05:48.224 --> 05:49.099
All right.

05:52.244 --> 05:53.109
Yeah.

06:01.383 --> 06:02.576
What's this?

06:02.577 --> 06:03.794
That is my essay test

06:03.795 --> 06:05.024
on The Outsiders.

06:05.025 --> 06:06.682
And that would be an F on the top.

06:06.683 --> 06:07.548
Again.

06:07.549 --> 06:08.895
This whole tutoring thing,

06:08.896 --> 06:11.788
it's not working for me anymore.

06:14.071 --> 06:16.231
Lux, I apologized for this morning.

06:16.232 --> 06:17.283
I'm sorry it's awkward.

06:17.284 --> 06:18.953
This is not about this morning.

06:18.954 --> 06:20.369
This is about wasting my time.

06:20.370 --> 06:21.385
I've read the book,

06:21.386 --> 06:22.975
I've shown up to all these sessions.

06:22.976 --> 06:24.793
Clearly, I don't understand this stuff.

06:24.794 --> 06:26.036
Well, you're required to be here,

06:26.037 --> 06:27.776
so you can't just quit on yourself.

06:28.903 --> 06:31.041
I'm not quitting on me.

06:31.042 --> 06:33.653
I'm quitting you, for good.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.009
I want a new tutor.

06:49.346 --> 06:50.474
What is in this suitcase?

06:50.475 --> 06:51.211
It weighs a ton.

06:51.212 --> 06:52.278
Oh, just some wedding stuff.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.587
You know, videos, photos,

06:54.588 --> 06:57.466
maybe a piece of wedding
cake on 12 pounds of dry ice.

06:58.119 --> 07:00.043
What? I am trying to
recreate our wedding.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.805
This is the honeymoon that
we never took, remember?

07:01.806 --> 07:03.981
All I'm saying is maybe a
suitcase on wheels next time.

07:03.982 --> 07:06.884
Okay, why don't we just
check in and get to the room?

07:06.885 --> 07:09.002
Got some business to attend to.

07:13.991 --> 07:14.741
That's weird.

07:14.742 --> 07:17.936
That looks like, uh, Baze's boss.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.659
And that's definitely

07:19.660 --> 07:21.735
Baze's dad...

07:21.736 --> 07:24.005
Oh, which means... Oh, my God.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.454
The retreat.

07:26.455 --> 07:28.808
Hey, guys.

07:28.809 --> 07:30.112
I get it now.

07:30.113 --> 07:33.188
A vacation where you stay in town.

07:33.189 --> 07:34.598
Staycation.

07:43.344 --> 07:53.176
Sync by YYeTs.net - Corrected by 4be1
www.addic7ed.com

07:55.009 --> 07:57.288
I mean, who cares if he's here?

07:57.289 --> 07:58.821
It's a huge hotel...

07:59.777 --> 08:01.547
We're never gonna see him.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.246
Especially since I don't
plan on leaving the room.

08:07.450 --> 08:09.409
That's our champagne and caviar.

08:18.387 --> 08:20.704
You are not my champagne and caviar.

08:20.705 --> 08:21.658
Really?

08:21.954 --> 08:23.927
Hi.

08:23.928 --> 08:26.281
I need to switch rooms with you guys.

08:26.282 --> 08:27.694
And now he's in our room.

08:27.695 --> 08:28.297
No.

08:28.298 --> 08:29.511
No way.

08:29.512 --> 08:31.293
Cate, come on.

08:31.294 --> 08:32.515
Emma is in the adjoining room,

08:32.517 --> 08:34.635
and I'm... I'm at the
other side of the hotel.

08:34.635 --> 08:35.227
So?

08:35.227 --> 08:37.763
So, adjoining room means adjoining door.

08:38.230 --> 08:39.239
You're the one

08:39.240 --> 08:40.809
who told me to score
some alone time with Emma.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.251
I'm just trying to follow
your very sage advice.

08:46.179 --> 08:47.520
I'm sorry.

08:50.602 --> 08:51.778
All right, I'll get the bags.

08:51.779 --> 08:52.414
Cool.

08:54.980 --> 08:55.980
All right.

08:57.457 --> 09:00.220
Hey, um, would you,
would you mind hurrying?

09:00.221 --> 09:02.646
I just want to hit the sauna
before the welcome party.

09:03.818 --> 09:05.474
Don't push it.

09:08.651 --> 09:09.980
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

09:19.969 --> 09:22.029
He was only here an hour.

09:22.030 --> 09:22.900
How is it possible

09:22.901 --> 09:24.380
to make this much mess?

09:25.670 --> 09:27.446
Whatever. You know, I... I'm just,

09:27.447 --> 09:28.331
I'm glad that Baze

09:28.332 --> 09:30.681
has someone to fixate on,
because if he has a girlfriend,

09:30.682 --> 09:32.949
he is gonna have less time to bother us.

09:32.950 --> 09:37.751
Put it like that, switching
rooms sounds like a win-win.

09:39.733 --> 09:41.446
Let the honeymoon begin.

09:41.447 --> 09:42.588
Oh, yeah.

09:43.327 --> 09:44.234
Ow!

09:44.235 --> 09:45.000
What?

09:45.283 --> 09:47.688
What happened? What?!

09:48.060 --> 09:49.048
Back.

09:49.226 --> 09:50.598
Spasms.

09:50.599 --> 09:52.090
Major pain.

09:52.091 --> 09:52.973
Ah...

10:03.562 --> 10:06.731
So, you stoked for movie night?

10:06.732 --> 10:08.376
Uh, yeah.

10:08.377 --> 10:09.583
Sure.

10:12.897 --> 10:15.715
So, uh, you and Mr. Daniels.

10:15.716 --> 10:19.063
Yeah, it's funny, I don't really
picture you guys together.

10:19.064 --> 10:20.081
Yeah, I know.

10:20.082 --> 10:22.565
I usually date guys taller than me.

10:24.263 --> 10:25.887
Ah, this is so fun!

10:25.888 --> 10:27.801
Cate, Ryan, Baze out of town.

10:27.802 --> 10:29.041
Me in charge.

10:29.042 --> 10:30.831
Funny, they were so worried.

10:30.832 --> 10:32.380
Like I don't know how to
take care of a teenager

10:32.381 --> 10:33.609
for a couple days.

10:33.610 --> 10:34.321
Right?

10:35.285 --> 10:37.123
Apple or chocolate Martini?

10:37.537 --> 10:38.389
Apple.

10:38.390 --> 10:41.473
Good choice. Baze said to
make sure you had fruit.

10:43.449 --> 10:44.210
Awesome.

10:44.211 --> 10:47.060
So, um, you and Mr. Daniels.

10:47.061 --> 10:48.324
How did you guys...

10:48.325 --> 10:50.128
I wonder who that could be.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.149
- Hi!
- Hi.

10:55.694 --> 10:57.214
How are you?

10:57.215 --> 10:58.131
Hi.

10:58.601 --> 11:00.589
Um, hi.

11:00.590 --> 11:03.378
Um, I didn't realize that you were...

11:04.684 --> 11:06.909
You know what, I'm just gonna,
I'm gonna go to Cate's

11:06.910 --> 11:08.145
and leave you guys alone.

11:08.146 --> 11:10.682
Oh, um, no, I'm here for you.

11:10.683 --> 11:11.778
Surprise!

11:11.779 --> 11:13.156
Look, Eric told me

11:13.157 --> 11:14.432
that you were having
some problems in school.

11:14.433 --> 11:15.506
And we thought that this

11:15.507 --> 11:18.085
would be a really fun
way to do your homework.

11:18.787 --> 11:20.249
The Outsiders.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.833
Patrick Swayze.

11:21.834 --> 11:22.732
Sad.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.302
Um, listen,

11:25.303 --> 11:26.950
I know that you had
trouble on that essay test,

11:26.951 --> 11:28.125
so I thought that
watching the movie would

11:28.126 --> 11:29.778
help you understand the book better.

11:29.779 --> 11:31.788
Okay, well, I already failed the test,

11:31.789 --> 11:33.421
so you're a little bit late.

11:33.422 --> 11:36.053
Yeah, but I emailed Math
to see about a makeup one.

11:36.054 --> 11:37.244
It's worth a shot, right?

11:37.245 --> 11:38.200
Popcorn's ready!

11:45.561 --> 11:46.398
Get out.

11:46.399 --> 11:47.879
You're in the room next to me?

11:48.779 --> 11:51.933
Hello. May I escort you
to the party, madame?

11:51.934 --> 11:52.584
No.

11:55.525 --> 11:56.752
Hey.

11:57.218 --> 11:58.531
What's up, Emm?

11:58.532 --> 12:01.246
Just... I'm gonna grab
a drink before the party.

12:01.247 --> 12:02.293
Want to?

12:11.861 --> 12:14.882
Uh... Hi.

12:14.883 --> 12:17.113
- Can I help you?
- Um...

12:17.633 --> 12:18.587
Uh, yeah.

12:18.588 --> 12:20.022
I... I just wanted to make sure

12:20.023 --> 12:20.868
that I was... You know, that I'm

12:20.869 --> 12:22.635
not being too loud over here.

12:22.636 --> 12:24.075
Uh, nope.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.085
You're good.

12:25.086 --> 12:26.689
Okay, all right, cool.

12:26.690 --> 12:27.534
Hey, actually,

12:27.535 --> 12:28.679
you know what?
I'm sorry.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.382
I... I thought that my boss
was staying in this room.

12:31.383 --> 12:32.887
She is.

12:32.888 --> 12:35.151
Steve, this is my assistant Nate.

12:35.152 --> 12:36.539
Okay.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.874
Pleased to meet you, buddy.

12:37.875 --> 12:39.941
Yeah. You... call me Baze.

12:39.942 --> 12:40.629
I didn't know you were

12:40.630 --> 12:41.973
staying next door.

12:41.974 --> 12:44.111
Did you need something?

12:44.851 --> 12:45.491
No.

12:50.681 --> 12:52.000
Here.

12:52.799 --> 12:54.261
And your drugs.

12:54.934 --> 12:55.754
Mmm.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.148
Maybe we should just go home.

12:59.149 --> 13:00.996
Oh, no way.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.785
I was promised some baby-making time,

13:03.786 --> 13:05.766
and I am not going
home until I get some.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.186
Look, the pills will
kick in soon, all right?

13:09.187 --> 13:11.628
And besides, this is
our honeymoon, remember?

13:13.103 --> 13:14.265
We could look at wedding photos.

13:14.266 --> 13:15.039
Oh, my God.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.092
Come on, the photographer
sent them over this morning.

13:17.093 --> 13:17.893
Bring 'em on.

13:19.107 --> 13:21.673
Okay. Uh, so these must be the photos

13:21.674 --> 13:23.367
taken at the church.

13:23.368 --> 13:24.612
God, you know, my parents...

13:24.613 --> 13:25.925
They can't even pretend to like

13:25.926 --> 13:27.862
each other on my wedding day.

13:27.863 --> 13:29.451
Look at Lux.

13:29.452 --> 13:30.902
How cute is she?

13:31.471 --> 13:33.984
Wait, is my mother holding
a flask in that photo?

13:33.985 --> 13:35.308
Well, technically she's not holding it,

13:35.309 --> 13:37.610
'cause it's tucked into her bra there.

13:40.344 --> 13:41.918
Who's that?

13:45.114 --> 13:47.700
Um, I can't remember.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.476
Oh, come on, it wasn't that long ago.

13:50.477 --> 13:51.594
Uh...

13:53.279 --> 13:54.450
Oh, yeah, right.

13:54.451 --> 13:55.582
That's, um, huh.

13:55.583 --> 13:58.018
Um, Julia.

13:58.019 --> 13:59.385
Your parents' friend Julia?

13:59.386 --> 14:01.377
The one that sent us the crystal vase?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.656
Did you send her a thank you note?

14:03.657 --> 14:05.767
Because I tried and we
don't even have her address.

14:05.768 --> 14:06.886
She wasn't on the guest list.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.096
I told you I was gonna
take care of that, Cate.

14:10.495 --> 14:12.142
She's not even dressed up.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.085
Who cares what she's wearing?

14:13.086 --> 14:14.221
Why are you obsessing about this?

14:14.222 --> 14:15.206
I am not obsessing.

14:15.207 --> 14:17.443
She was at the wedding
and she gave us a gift.

14:17.444 --> 14:19.386
I would like to send
her a thank you note.

14:19.387 --> 14:21.281
I mean, how am I supposed
to send her a thank you note

14:21.282 --> 14:23.311
if I'm not even sure we invited her?

14:23.312 --> 14:24.672
All right, well, you want to talk about

14:24.673 --> 14:26.320
uninvited guests at our wedding,

14:26.321 --> 14:28.696
I can think of someone else
we should be talking about.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.525
Why are you doing this?

14:36.526 --> 14:38.563
Why are you picking a fight about Baze?

14:38.564 --> 14:39.112
I...

14:39.876 --> 14:41.286
I just...

14:42.301 --> 14:44.628
It's my back, okay? It hurts.

14:47.472 --> 14:49.297
I'll get you more ice.

15:05.312 --> 15:06.752
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:07.305 --> 15:08.885
That was fast.

15:08.886 --> 15:12.041
Well, I called, you picked up.

15:12.042 --> 15:12.990
I'm here.

15:12.991 --> 15:14.183
You're drunk.

15:14.184 --> 15:16.313
And engaged.

15:17.013 --> 15:18.541
Yeah, we broke up.

15:19.559 --> 15:21.634
Cate... She, uh, she cheated on me.

15:21.635 --> 15:22.698
I just found out in the middle

15:22.699 --> 15:26.679
of this stupid car.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.032
It's a long story.

15:28.683 --> 15:30.054
I'm a good listener.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.965
I didn't come here to talk.

16:17.525 --> 16:18.592
Hi.

16:18.593 --> 16:19.863
You look great.

16:20.468 --> 16:21.417
Thanks.

16:21.418 --> 16:24.449
Okay, so who is this Steve guy?

16:24.450 --> 16:26.673
I mean, you never mentioned
him at the concert,

16:26.674 --> 16:27.926
and I'm just wondering...

16:29.213 --> 16:30.378
Sorry for the wait, babe.

16:30.379 --> 16:31.863
It's a free-for-all at the bar.

16:31.864 --> 16:32.833
What's up, Buzz?

16:32.834 --> 16:34.305
- Baze.
- Right.

16:34.306 --> 16:36.251
I'm sorry, man,
I'm really bad with names.

16:36.252 --> 16:37.775
No, no, don't worry about it.

16:37.776 --> 16:39.112
After all the weeks
I've worked with Emma,

16:39.113 --> 16:40.897
she's failed to mention yours, so...

16:40.898 --> 16:42.627
Stephanie, Josh.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.608
This is my son Nate.

16:44.609 --> 16:46.765
Jack, this is the guy
I was telling you about.

16:47.809 --> 16:49.482
You got to tell that story again...

16:49.483 --> 16:51.616
You climbing Kilimanjaro hungover.

16:52.981 --> 16:53.533
Well...

16:53.534 --> 16:54.933
You better watch it, Emm.

16:54.934 --> 16:56.365
The girls in asset management

16:56.366 --> 16:58.217
were all over him.

16:59.079 --> 17:00.574
Hi. I'm Jack.

17:00.575 --> 17:01.295
How you doing?

17:01.296 --> 17:02.386
Good. How are you?

17:02.387 --> 17:04.765
Steve's a managing director
over at Morgan Stanley.

17:04.766 --> 17:06.223
Morgan Stanley?

17:06.224 --> 17:07.997
Loved him in driving miss Daisy.

17:08.383 --> 17:09.989
Am I right, people?

17:12.555 --> 17:15.012
Hey, you hear about Morgan
Stanley's Biotech fund?

17:15.012 --> 17:16.823
It's up 18% year to date.

17:16.824 --> 17:18.498
Best-performing fund of its kind.

17:18.499 --> 17:20.499
He's right, Jack, we really
should get on top of that.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.519
Actually, I think your
numbers are off, Steve.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.827
The Fenmore Biotech 4 fund is...
It's up 20% year to date.

17:27.828 --> 17:28.947
Ergo, how could yours be

17:28.948 --> 17:30.898
the best-performing fund in its class?

17:30.899 --> 17:32.423
I'm impressed.

17:33.351 --> 17:35.345
You have been learning a thing or two.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.801
I guess we can all afford

17:36.802 --> 17:38.903
to stay on top of things
a little bit better.

17:39.365 --> 17:40.792
Yeah, yeah, we could.

17:41.588 --> 17:42.854
Unfortunately, numbers have

17:42.855 --> 17:44.625
never been one of Emma's strong suits.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.442
So now that you watched the

17:51.443 --> 17:52.896
outsiders, what those names?

17:52.897 --> 17:56.427
Oh, that was the worst
fake blood I've ever seen.

17:57.150 --> 17:58.789
High cheese factor, I'll give you that.

17:58.790 --> 17:59.870
I blame the '80s.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.090
Oh, that explains the hair.

18:01.091 --> 18:04.030
God, did they use gel
or actual motor oil?

18:04.696 --> 18:06.599
And what's with those names?

18:06.600 --> 18:08.404
Sodapop, Ponyboy,

18:08.405 --> 18:09.125
Cherry.

18:09.126 --> 18:11.070
Oh, 'cause Lux is such a normal name.

18:11.071 --> 18:13.002
And you call me Minnesota.

18:13.003 --> 18:14.801
That makes sense. Johnny.

18:15.218 --> 18:16.752
Johnny's a perfectly normal name.

18:16.753 --> 18:18.273
Okay, but Johnny's just an excuse

18:18.274 --> 18:20.165
for the greasers to act all gangster.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.036
Without him, they would just be
a boy band without a band.

18:23.037 --> 18:24.940
Johnny represents hope.

18:24.941 --> 18:25.439
Hmm...

18:25.440 --> 18:26.934
Okay, I knew that you'd like this.

18:26.935 --> 18:29.010
All right, this is all
about the have and have-nots.

18:29.011 --> 18:30.189
The gap between rich and poor.

18:30.190 --> 18:31.609
This is not about the gap.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.908
That's the point. I mean,
sure the Socs have a nicer ride,

18:37.519 --> 18:38.896
you know, they're
afraid of being jumped,

18:38.897 --> 18:40.168
they fall in love,

18:40.169 --> 18:41.963
they have the same awful
taste in hair products.

18:41.964 --> 18:43.277
I... I thought the point was that there is

18:43.278 --> 18:44.926
no real difference between them.

18:44.927 --> 18:49.044
Lux, you realize, you do understand

18:49.045 --> 18:50.385
this stuff.

18:51.611 --> 18:54.226
You should take the test over.

18:57.421 --> 19:02.098
Wow. You know, I don't want
to take that test over.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.367
I don't want you to talk to Math.

19:03.368 --> 19:04.831
I don't want your help!

19:04.832 --> 19:06.479
God, dude!

19:07.035 --> 19:08.411
Take a hint!

19:08.739 --> 19:10.145
Go home.

19:14.424 --> 19:16.576
Right, you can't.

19:16.577 --> 19:19.213
You're on a date with your girlfriend.

19:20.389 --> 19:22.485
If you're not leaving, I am.

19:23.112 --> 19:24.951
Lux, wait.

19:24.952 --> 19:26.250
Wait.

19:37.009 --> 19:37.940
Hello.

19:37.941 --> 19:39.487
Hey, it's Cate.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.123
Hey, Cate.

19:41.124 --> 19:43.115
How's the second honeymoon going?

19:43.116 --> 19:44.241
It's pretty much consisted

19:44.242 --> 19:45.445
of me walking back and forth

19:45.446 --> 19:47.325
to the ice machine
for the last two hours.

19:47.326 --> 19:49.198
But, uh, it's fine.

19:49.199 --> 19:51.131
Look, I was just calling
to check in on Lux.

19:51.132 --> 19:51.835
Is she there?

19:53.059 --> 19:55.091
You know, she's doing
her homework right now,

19:55.092 --> 19:57.309
so it's probably best not to bother her.

19:57.310 --> 19:58.529
I'll tell her you called, though.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.673
Uh, Paige, hang on.

20:01.168 --> 20:02.708
Um, can I ask you something?

20:02.709 --> 20:03.393
Yeah.

20:04.622 --> 20:07.251
What do you know about
your parents' friend Julia?

20:07.252 --> 20:08.761
My parents don't have any friends.

20:08.762 --> 20:10.280
They hate each other.

20:11.850 --> 20:13.766
Oh. Oh.

20:13.767 --> 20:16.881
You mean Julia Julia, like, Ryan's ex?

20:18.749 --> 20:20.537
Um, yeah.

20:20.538 --> 20:22.484
Yeah. Uh, were they serious?

20:23.340 --> 20:24.668
You're kidding, right?

20:24.669 --> 20:27.360
I mean, you know, she's,
like, the one that got away.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.923
Ryan never told you about Julia?

21:03.159 --> 21:05.488
- What are you doing here?
- Your mom said you'd be here.

21:05.489 --> 21:06.892
I didn't know what else to do.

21:06.893 --> 21:08.235
You weren't answering my calls.

21:08.236 --> 21:08.981
Yeah, for a reason.

21:08.982 --> 21:10.099
We have the rehearsal dinner tonight,

21:10.100 --> 21:11.339
and the wedding is tomorrow, Julia.

21:11.340 --> 21:14.663
Ryan... I think...

21:15.976 --> 21:17.473
I'm pregnant.

21:18.487 --> 21:19.365
What?

21:20.097 --> 21:22.389
I, uh, I took a home test.

21:22.390 --> 21:24.336
Oh, my God, Julia.

21:24.337 --> 21:26.066
I am marrying Cate tomorrow.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.041
I mean, what, am I supposed
to tell her today,

21:28.042 --> 21:29.221
before the rehearsal?

21:29.222 --> 21:30.733
Well, listen, listen,
calm down... calm down?

21:30.734 --> 21:33.163
I'm going to the doctor to confirm it.

21:33.164 --> 21:35.492
I just felt like you should know.

21:35.493 --> 21:37.254
But there's no reason
to say anything to Cate

21:37.255 --> 21:39.012
until we know for sure.

21:40.965 --> 21:43.075
Julia, I'm here for
you no matter what, but

21:44.697 --> 21:46.769
I... I got to go before she sees us.

21:46.770 --> 21:47.279
Just...

21:50.585 --> 21:52.708
Just call me when you know.

21:53.114 --> 21:53.758
I will.

22:01.659 --> 22:03.087
Hey, hey!

22:03.784 --> 22:06.020
I got the rings.

22:06.021 --> 22:07.774
Talked to the minister.

22:07.775 --> 22:11.357
Uh, the rehearsal is
on for tonight at...

22:11.832 --> 22:13.208
5:00.

22:13.873 --> 22:15.457
So, is it official?

22:15.458 --> 22:17.348
It's all legal, you're
a part of the family?

22:17.349 --> 22:18.034
Mm-hmm.

22:19.799 --> 22:21.496
I guess tomorrow is my turn, huh?

22:24.337 --> 22:26.129
Oh, my God, it's my mom.

22:26.130 --> 22:27.507
Hello, mom.

22:27.508 --> 22:28.288
What's up?

22:40.976 --> 22:42.162
Lux, you can't make this

22:42.163 --> 22:43.866
personal or fail at school

22:43.867 --> 22:45.215
Just because you're
upset about me and Paige.

22:45.216 --> 22:47.251
Oh, my God! I am not
failing out because of you.

22:47.252 --> 22:49.109
I was failing out long
before you showed up.

22:49.110 --> 22:51.296
How is that possible when
you clearly know the material?

22:51.297 --> 22:53.049
Okay. For the bazillionth
time, I don't know!

22:53.050 --> 22:55.130
Here, here, take this stupid test

22:55.131 --> 22:56.220
and the pathetic essay

22:56.221 --> 22:57.451
and you figure it out for yourself

22:57.452 --> 22:59.277
if you think you're
such a brilliant teacher!

22:59.278 --> 23:00.884
- Lux, stop it!
- No. Why do you care?

23:00.885 --> 23:03.437
Why do you care if I show up
for stupid tutoring or not?

23:03.438 --> 23:04.949
'Cause maybe tutoring is the only way

23:04.950 --> 23:06.468
I can actually spend time with you

23:06.469 --> 23:08.580
without it being wrong, okay?!

23:14.446 --> 23:15.589
It's the only thing that we're

23:15.590 --> 23:17.495
actually allowed

23:19.476 --> 23:21.041
I don't want to give that up.

23:22.129 --> 23:24.511
I don't want to give up
getting to know you.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.099
I like that part.

23:26.352 --> 23:27.432
A lot.

23:29.734 --> 23:32.197
Well, who's making it personal now?

23:34.183 --> 23:36.845
So what... what... what does it change?

23:42.006 --> 23:43.042
That's what I thought.

23:47.216 --> 23:48.202
Lux.

24:05.329 --> 24:08.656
So, um, Julia's your ex.

24:11.042 --> 24:13.317
Kind of buried the
lead on that one, huh?

24:13.830 --> 24:16.462
Yeah, I, uh, I... I talked to Paige.

24:17.444 --> 24:18.388
Why didn't you tell me?

24:18.389 --> 24:19.533
Why did you lie?

24:20.333 --> 24:23.652
Okay. Yes, Julia and I dated.

24:23.832 --> 24:26.195
But Cate, that was a long time ago.

24:26.662 --> 24:28.939
Well, according to Paige,
she was the love of your life,

24:28.940 --> 24:30.032
which is a pretty big thing

24:30.033 --> 24:31.759
to never mention in three years.

24:31.760 --> 24:35.638
I... I don't understand what your
ex was doing at our wedding.

24:36.944 --> 24:38.054
Cate.

24:40.370 --> 24:45.378
When you and I broke up,
Julia and I slept together.

24:46.592 --> 24:47.226
Uh, h-hold on.

24:47.227 --> 24:49.466
It was only one time, okay?
And that was it.

24:49.467 --> 24:51.201
I... I... I knew it was a mistake.

24:51.202 --> 24:54.470
I was, I was drunk, and...
and I was... I was hurt.

24:54.471 --> 24:57.404
And Julia and I didn't even
really talk after that...

25:00.047 --> 25:02.039
until the day before our wedding.

25:04.220 --> 25:06.804
Julia came to me, and she said

25:06.805 --> 25:09.053
that she thought she was pregnant.

25:11.708 --> 25:13.119
Oh, my God.

25:13.481 --> 25:14.862
No, I...

25:15.571 --> 25:17.073
I thought you had doubts,

25:17.074 --> 25:18.673
and I asked you.

25:18.674 --> 25:19.720
I came to you,

25:19.721 --> 25:22.826
and you... no, you did,
you told me, you promised me

25:22.827 --> 25:24.045
that it was all in my head!

25:24.046 --> 25:25.855
That wasn't true, was it?

25:25.856 --> 25:27.695
And when you were talking to Lux

25:27.696 --> 25:29.259
and you were being that great guy

25:29.260 --> 25:31.159
and you were putting her first,

25:31.753 --> 25:32.744
were you just looking

25:32.745 --> 25:34.406
- for a way out?
- No, Cate!

25:34.407 --> 25:36.499
Everything I said to Lux was the truth.

25:37.491 --> 25:38.665
Look, I would have called

25:38.666 --> 25:40.942
the wedding off for her,
if that's what she wanted.

25:42.171 --> 25:43.049
But yeah...

25:46.151 --> 25:48.205
I had my own reasons, too.

25:48.404 --> 25:49.081
Uh, look.

25:49.082 --> 25:51.336
If this is all too much for you, um...

25:51.758 --> 25:52.923
We can wait.

25:52.924 --> 25:54.920
We can postpone it, 'cause...

25:56.080 --> 25:58.304
If you're not ready, neither am I.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.299
Shouldn't you talk to Cate?

26:03.792 --> 26:06.355
If this is what you want, uh...

26:07.645 --> 26:09.589
She should probably hear it from you.

26:31.838 --> 26:32.716
Julia.

26:34.222 --> 26:35.143
I tried calling, but...

26:36.917 --> 26:38.531
It was just a false alarm.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.079
I'm not pregnant.

26:44.524 --> 26:45.428
Okay.

26:45.863 --> 26:47.141
So what?

26:47.428 --> 26:50.342
I'm just supposed to be okay
because she's not pregnant?

26:51.222 --> 26:52.958
What if she had been pregnant?

26:53.910 --> 26:55.600
Would you have called off the wedding?

26:59.037 --> 27:00.041
I don't know.

27:19.858 --> 27:20.820
Hey.

27:23.295 --> 27:24.466
Where's Steve?

27:25.276 --> 27:26.746
Steve had a headache.

27:27.248 --> 27:28.578
On my behalf.

27:29.829 --> 27:32.219
Well, I'm sorry about earlier.

27:32.220 --> 27:35.449
He just... He mentioned the one thing

27:35.450 --> 27:40.402
that I happen to know something
about, and I jumped on it.

27:41.241 --> 27:45.126
No... you're good with numbers.

27:47.821 --> 27:49.188
I, on the other hand...

27:49.386 --> 27:50.980
No, Emm, look.

27:51.620 --> 27:55.584
I know what it is like to
suffer the wrath of my dad.

27:57.471 --> 27:58.892
I thought he went easier on his

27:58.893 --> 28:00.665
kids than he did right now.

28:00.666 --> 28:01.288
No way.

28:01.289 --> 28:02.887
Believe me, I get it.

28:03.209 --> 28:05.492
I mean, that guy beat
me down for a long time.

28:05.493 --> 28:07.404
Little comments here and there.

28:07.674 --> 28:09.321
They chip away at you.

28:10.017 --> 28:11.500
And before you know it,

28:11.726 --> 28:13.572
you're a 30-something-
year-old guy,

28:13.889 --> 28:15.243
you're sitting around in your boxers,

28:15.244 --> 28:18.074
living with roommates,
playing video games,

28:18.075 --> 28:19.389
running a bar...

28:19.865 --> 28:21.428
Sounds pretty good right now.

28:21.429 --> 28:23.093
Yeah, well...

28:23.094 --> 28:24.918
Well, things with him, they can change.

28:26.372 --> 28:27.252
He and I...

28:30.993 --> 28:32.802
We've come a long way.

28:33.761 --> 28:35.917
And it's, you know...

28:35.918 --> 28:37.587
I mean, he's a large part of the reason

28:37.588 --> 28:39.114
why it took me so long to get to

28:39.115 --> 28:41.040
where I wanted to be in my life.

28:41.654 --> 28:42.195
You know...

28:42.732 --> 28:44.718
Where'd you want to be in your life?

28:45.176 --> 28:46.098
With my kid.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.757
At this company.

28:51.209 --> 28:53.115
On this retreat.

28:53.346 --> 28:56.511
Here. With you.

28:59.407 --> 29:00.624
Buy you a drink?

29:00.625 --> 29:02.832
Well, I think the bartender left.

29:02.833 --> 29:05.874
Well, you know, not so
long ago, I was a bartender,

29:05.875 --> 29:08.286
so let's see if I can
go work some magic.

29:14.376 --> 29:15.196
Aha!

29:17.642 --> 29:19.120
Oh, wow!

29:19.444 --> 29:21.758
I mean, that's class.

29:21.759 --> 29:23.508
Yeah, well, you can just be happy

29:23.509 --> 29:25.265
that I didn't offer to buy you dinner.

29:25.266 --> 29:26.764
'Cause I think I see some...

29:26.765 --> 29:29.008
- I see some leftovers right there.
- Mm.

29:30.707 --> 29:31.895
This is nice.

29:32.090 --> 29:32.808
Yeah.

29:33.123 --> 29:34.175
Yeah, it is.

29:35.885 --> 29:38.699
No, I meant I'm glad
I'm here with you, too.

29:49.434 --> 29:50.539
I'm so sorry.

29:50.540 --> 29:51.660
We shouldn't...

29:51.661 --> 29:53.029
This is, um...

29:53.030 --> 29:54.442
Just wrong.

29:54.443 --> 29:56.418
Emma, no, it's not.

29:56.419 --> 29:59.001
It is for, like, a million reasons.

29:59.002 --> 30:00.408
I'm sorry.

30:00.409 --> 30:02.516
Steve's probably waiting; I should go.

30:13.739 --> 30:15.717
Hey, Ryan, sorry.

30:15.718 --> 30:17.688
I know it's so late, but, um...

30:18.450 --> 30:20.287
I need to talk to Cate.

30:20.288 --> 30:21.902
She went home.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.601
What? What happened to your honeymoon?

30:25.215 --> 30:27.486
We got into an argument.

30:27.487 --> 30:29.739
Let's just say getting
together with your ex

30:29.740 --> 30:32.686
before your wedding...
Not a great idea.

30:35.465 --> 30:36.904
Okay. Um...

30:38.567 --> 30:41.561
Look, I don't know what
Cate told you, but...

30:43.125 --> 30:44.515
it wasn't all her fault.

30:44.516 --> 30:45.580
It was mine, really.

30:45.581 --> 30:47.012
I mean, if I hadn't had
feelings for Cate,

30:47.013 --> 30:48.652
then she wouldn't have had doubts

30:48.653 --> 30:50.739
and been wondering if she had...

30:52.374 --> 30:55.451
feelings for me, but...

30:57.254 --> 31:00.156
Okay, you know what, this...
this is the alcohol talking.

31:00.157 --> 31:01.707
Ryan, I'm a little drunk right now.

31:01.708 --> 31:05.123
Okay, Baze, just tell me what happened.

31:21.935 --> 31:24.303
Hey, it's Cate. Leave a message.

31:24.657 --> 31:27.327
Cate, yeah, it's me; we need to talk.

31:27.945 --> 31:29.773
I screwed things up big time.

31:29.774 --> 31:32.307
Not with me and Emma...
Well, yeah, yeah, that, too...

31:32.308 --> 31:33.814
but I talked to Ryan.

31:33.815 --> 31:35.168
Anyway, call.

31:35.169 --> 31:36.593
I'll explain.

31:37.275 --> 31:38.473
Hey, what's up, babe?

31:41.024 --> 31:42.734
Hi, Steve.

31:44.118 --> 31:45.511
Who's your friend?

31:50.422 --> 31:52.773
So Steve likes dudes, huh?

31:53.125 --> 31:55.746
Oh, God. What did he tell you?

31:55.747 --> 31:57.538
That you guys aren't dating.

31:57.539 --> 32:00.613
But you do see each other
twice a week... in spin class.

32:00.614 --> 32:03.458
Oh... fine. It's true.

32:05.836 --> 32:09.480
Look, I hate coming to these
things single and alone.

32:09.481 --> 32:12.648
I can't stand the looks I
get from people, you know.

32:12.649 --> 32:14.530
"Poor Emma doesn't have
anyone in her life."

32:14.531 --> 32:16.277
"Poor Emma only has her career."

32:16.278 --> 32:19.041
Okay, so you pretend to
be in a fake relationship?

32:19.042 --> 32:20.573
I mean, that's like...

32:20.574 --> 32:22.788
Well, something I would do.

32:22.789 --> 32:24.320
Now I'm even more depressed.

32:24.321 --> 32:26.758
You don't have to be alone.

32:26.759 --> 32:30.811
I mean, there's plenty of guys
who would date you for real.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.417
Okay, first of all,

32:35.067 --> 32:36.230
you're Jack's son.

32:36.231 --> 32:37.133
Second, you seem

32:37.134 --> 32:38.451
- to forget I'm your boss.
- So?

32:38.934 --> 32:41.006
And third, even if I could,

32:41.007 --> 32:43.458
relationships just aren't my thing.

32:43.459 --> 32:45.307
They take up too much time and effort,

32:45.308 --> 32:48.730
someone always gets hurt,
and I would just rather be alone.

32:48.731 --> 32:50.659
No one would rather be alone.

32:50.891 --> 32:53.617
Only people who really want
to be with someone say that.

32:54.120 --> 32:54.721
And...

32:54.995 --> 32:56.091
Putting yourself out there doesn't

32:56.092 --> 32:58.010
automatically mean that
you're going to get hurt.

32:58.011 --> 32:58.734
Really?

32:59.321 --> 33:00.893
'Cause you put yourself
out there with Cate

33:00.894 --> 33:02.641
and where did that get you?

33:14.276 --> 33:15.235
Hi.

33:16.838 --> 33:18.841
I want to talk about last night.

33:19.534 --> 33:21.262
Listen, you were right.

33:21.704 --> 33:23.749
You weren't the only one
making things personal.

33:33.184 --> 33:36.834
Lux, I... I can't show you

33:36.835 --> 33:39.511
that I care about you
like normal people can.

33:39.898 --> 33:42.732
The only way that I can show
it is through your schoolwork.

33:44.033 --> 33:45.547
You know all those tests and essays

33:45.548 --> 33:46.898
that you threw at me?

33:46.899 --> 33:49.304
Well, I went through all of them.

33:51.743 --> 33:54.894
Lux, have you ever been tested
for a learning disability?

33:56.320 --> 33:57.107
What?

33:57.407 --> 33:59.396
Because I think that you might have one.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.368
But if you just give me a chance

34:02.369 --> 34:04.259
to help you the one way that I can...

34:06.912 --> 34:10.190
I know that everything can't change.

34:12.103 --> 34:13.478
But some things can.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.219
Cate.

34:22.039 --> 34:23.056
Can we talk?

34:23.386 --> 34:27.797
Uh... Not really sure
that I'm ready to talk.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.190
Are you really doing this?

34:29.627 --> 34:30.379
Doing what?

34:30.380 --> 34:32.317
I mean, what is it
that I am doing, Ryan?

34:32.318 --> 34:33.873
Pretending like I was
the only one that had

34:33.873 --> 34:35.897
a secret at the wedding.

34:37.887 --> 34:38.605
Yeah.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.632
Baze told me everything, Cate.

34:40.634 --> 34:42.420
He said you were over at his loft.

34:42.652 --> 34:44.040
He said it was you

34:44.041 --> 34:45.428
that was having doubts.

34:45.429 --> 34:48.313
He said you were afraid that
you were in love with him?

34:48.315 --> 34:50.951
No, Ryan... I mean, God,
well, yes, I mean, I said that.

34:50.952 --> 34:54.005
But, you know, obviously
it was, it was just because

34:54.007 --> 34:55.195
I was sensing your doubts,

34:55.196 --> 34:56.795
which is why I went over
there to begin with...

34:56.795 --> 34:58.607
- No, don't even pin this on me.
- I put those feelings to bed

34:58.608 --> 35:00.461
the second that I said "I do."

35:00.462 --> 35:02.445
Okay, but what would you have done?

35:02.798 --> 35:03.893
Not now, but then.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.881
If he had told you that he loved you?

35:08.673 --> 35:10.243
Would you have called off the wedding?

35:18.112 --> 35:19.522
I don't know.

35:37.780 --> 35:39.460
Whoa. You okay?

35:39.461 --> 35:40.061
No.

35:41.279 --> 35:44.109
This is why I don't date
guys shorter than me.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.661
Eric broke up with me.

35:50.179 --> 35:52.069
I... I'm sorry.

35:54.660 --> 35:55.548
Whatever.

35:56.254 --> 35:57.520
What'd he say?

35:59.430 --> 36:01.985
That he has feelings for somebody else.

36:18.586 --> 36:20.402
Cate, hey. Hey.

36:20.403 --> 36:22.069
I... I just came to get Lux.

36:22.737 --> 36:24.220
I got your messages.

36:24.221 --> 36:25.274
I mean, not in time,

36:25.275 --> 36:28.111
but I don't really think it
would've made a difference.

36:28.455 --> 36:30.066
I'm so sorry.

36:31.592 --> 36:34.087
I thought my days of messing
up you and Ryan were done with.

36:34.088 --> 36:35.606
You didn't mess us up.

36:38.535 --> 36:39.616
God, for so long,

36:39.617 --> 36:42.115
we thought the root of
all our problems was you.

36:43.578 --> 36:46.334
If you had told me, you
know, two months ago,

36:46.335 --> 36:47.856
when I was standing
on this deck with you,

36:47.857 --> 36:49.847
that I would be in a
better place with you

36:49.848 --> 36:51.485
than I am with Ryan...

36:51.666 --> 36:53.196
Look, I am sorry.

36:53.829 --> 36:55.615
That night... That was my fault.

36:55.616 --> 36:57.071
And I told Ryan that.

36:57.072 --> 36:58.989
It's not what you did that night...

37:00.599 --> 37:01.709
You know, it's what I did.

37:01.710 --> 37:03.353
I came over here looking...

37:06.382 --> 37:08.178
looking for something.

37:08.838 --> 37:10.470
I was looking for answers.

37:13.546 --> 37:15.539
All you did was not say you love me.

37:24.235 --> 37:25.386
We need to talk.

37:27.131 --> 37:30.074
You're wrong, about what
you said at the hotel.

37:30.075 --> 37:32.682
I didn't get hurt because I put
myself out there with Cate.

37:32.683 --> 37:36.604
I got hurt because I didn't
put myself out there.

37:36.605 --> 37:38.531
When she came to me the
night before her wedding,

37:38.532 --> 37:41.318
I didn't say what I should have said.

37:41.319 --> 37:44.097
In fact, I didn't do anything.

37:44.098 --> 37:45.704
And when I tried to,

37:45.705 --> 37:47.340
I was too late.

37:47.784 --> 37:49.443
And I don't want to be too late again.

37:49.444 --> 37:51.600
And I don't want to
make the same mistakes.

37:51.601 --> 37:53.812
I am not afraid of getting hurt.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.921
I'm afraid of not having the balls

37:55.922 --> 37:58.825
to put myself out
there to even get hurt.

37:59.679 --> 38:01.399
So I'm going balls out.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.841
So to speak.

38:04.399 --> 38:05.797
Oh, God.

38:06.056 --> 38:07.372
I like you, Emma.

38:07.373 --> 38:10.670
I think you're crazy
hot and scary as hell,

38:10.671 --> 38:12.446
but I like you and...

38:19.517 --> 38:21.997
I want to know if you like me, too.

38:31.788 --> 38:32.762
Cate...

38:32.763 --> 38:36.017
I... I don't know what to say.

38:36.557 --> 38:37.624
I know.

38:38.444 --> 38:41.648
You and Ryan... You guys
are gonna be okay, right?

38:41.649 --> 38:43.826
You're gonna get through this?

38:43.827 --> 38:46.246
Of course, we're... we're
gonna get through it.

38:50.073 --> 38:52.166
It's gonna be okay, Lux.

38:53.792 --> 38:55.528
We're all gonna be okay.

38:58.091 --> 38:58.899
Okay.

39:01.366 --> 39:04.252
Well, now that I am playing hooky today,

39:04.253 --> 39:05.691
do you want me to take you to school?

39:05.692 --> 39:07.871
I know that Baze went early.

39:08.332 --> 39:09.378
Uh, no.

39:09.379 --> 39:13.817
Um, I still have time before
tutoring with Mr. Daniels,

39:13.818 --> 39:15.891
so I will just bike.

39:17.394 --> 39:18.345
Bye.

39:21.639 --> 39:22.539
Lux.

39:30.799 --> 39:31.933
Have a good day.

40:13.492 --> 40:14.029
Oh.

40:14.030 --> 40:16.085
Uh, where's Mr. Daniels?

40:16.086 --> 40:17.592
You must be Lux.

40:17.593 --> 40:18.627
Mr. Daniels asked me

40:18.628 --> 40:21.296
to step in as your tutor going forward.

40:21.297 --> 40:23.078
So, have a seat.

40:23.079 --> 40:25.489
Let's get started on some tests.

40:25.689 --> 40:35.889
