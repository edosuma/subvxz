00:52.800 --> 00:53.700
Hi.

00:54.800 --> 00:55.800
Hi.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.600
My name is, Kent.
What's your name?

00:58.700 --> 00:59.700
Daphne.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.600
Daphne. That's a really beautiful name.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.700
It sounds like a
name of a flower.

01:03.700 --> 01:06.700
Obviously I know that it's not a flower, 
but it sounds like it could be.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.600
I like flowers.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.800
Smelling them, stuff like that.
Sending them to people, it's good.

01:17.700 --> 01:18.700
Where are you from?

01:19.700 --> 01:20.700
Connecticut.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.600
Really? I'm a big fan of, Connecticut.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.600
I'm a... Who isn't, right?
You're close enough to the city...

01:25.600 --> 01:27.600
...and you can really enjoy it.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.700
But your also far enough that 
you got a small town field.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.700
- Did you go to school out there?
- Yeah, I did. I went to Wesslam.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.000
That's perfect, that's a great school.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.500
- What's did you major in..?
- Psychology.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.700
It's great.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.700
Those are really beautiful
earrings, by the way.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.700
They do a nice job 
of complementing your...

01:42.700 --> 01:44.600
I'm gonna stop you right there.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.800
Because on paper
you've done everything right.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.600
You've took an interest
in my personal history.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.600
You've complemented
my accessories.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.800
Blah, blah, blah.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.800
If we'd met in college, our relationship, 
probably would've developed between us.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.600
Which I would have come to regret 
because I would have found out...

02:00.600 --> 02:02.700
...that you're just as boring
and polite in the bedroom...

02:02.700 --> 02:05.600
...as you have been during
this, god awful conversation.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.700
Okay, Daphne...

02:06.700 --> 02:08.699
If I wanted a nice
sexual pen pal...

02:08.699 --> 02:09.699
...you'd be at the top of my list.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.500
We'd just, l-chat all night long.
LOL. Tickles.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.700
But unfortunately, that's
not what I'm looking for.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.800
I want a man whose
hand doesn't shake...

02:19.600 --> 02:22.500
...when he puts it up my shirt.
Do you know what I'm saying?

02:22.700 --> 02:24.700
Okay.
Daphne, if I could just...

02:24.700 --> 02:26.800
Save it, Kent.
I'm not looking for a BFF.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.600
Daphne, please.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.600
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

02:33.700 --> 02:35.800
-What did you call me?
-I didn't stutter.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.600
Oh you sure can talk the talk,
you crazy little slut.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.600
But, can you
deliver the goodies?

02:42.600 --> 02:44.600
I don't give a damn
about, Connecticut.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.700
I hate those cheap buildings.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.700
I'm from, North Dakota and this
is how we handle our business...

02:50.800 --> 02:52.700
...in the vice and state, mamma.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.800
Get your hands off me, right now.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.600
Or I will take you to your knees 
in front of this entire bar.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.600
Promise?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.700
Hold on, angel crossing!
Angel crossing!

03:18.800 --> 03:21.500
Get on there. Here we 
come. Watch out!

03:39.700 --> 03:40.800
What a beautiful view.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.800
So, this is where you live?

03:47.700 --> 03:50.600
This is where you live 
too, honey. Come on.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.700
What do you think
about, Daphne?

03:57.800 --> 03:59.700
- I really liked, Daphne.
- You did?

03:59.700 --> 04:01.600
- Yeah.
- Definitely naughty.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.700
She's was a lot naughty,
but in the fun way.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.700
What about, Kent,
did you like him?

04:05.700 --> 04:06.800
- Kent was hot.
- Really?

04:06.800 --> 04:08.700
I like those glasses,
that was a nice touch.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.800
You want to try fill in 
the whole great planes vibe?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.600
Like he was an angry 
cowboy who drives a van.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.600
- Hot.
- But also has ninja equipment...

04:15.600 --> 04:17.700
...back in his apartment.
A lot's happening.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.800
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.600
Like a transformer.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.500
- I'd like to meet, Kent again.
- Yeah, come here.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.500
Toothpaste and all.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.700
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you, Brad.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.500
You are the best girl
in the whole world.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.700
Let's get these off, of you.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.600
That was fun.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.800
- That feels good.
- It's the acupressure.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.800
- Oh really?
- No, I just like to rub it.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.700
You know, this stuff is connected 
to all different stuff inside your tummy.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.800
- I know that.
- I push the wrong thing...

05:11.800 --> 05:13.800
- You know what that's for?
- Not till later.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.800
Okay.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.600
So when's the big day?

05:18.600 --> 05:19.600
- Hmm.
- I'm sorry?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.700
We're getting married in the
spring in, South Carolina.

05:22.700 --> 05:25.500
- Yeah, what about you guys?
- We're not getting married.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.700
So, why do you take
the dance classes?

05:28.700 --> 05:31.600
We do a lot of stuff together.
That's one of many thing we do together.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.600
Yeah, it's fun.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.800
Can't think of what
we don't do together.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.700
Right, so why wouldn't you
wanna get married?

05:37.600 --> 05:38.700
- Yeah.
- We are happy.

05:38.700 --> 05:39.700
- We're happy.
- Yeah.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.800
And I love her.
Marriage kind of brings pressure...

05:41.800 --> 05:43.700
...and stress and all kinds of stuff.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.700
We don't want our relationship
to turn into work.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.700
We just wanna be together
'cause we enjoy it.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.500
Not because we have to, you know?.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.800
There's a reason that they
use the expression:

05:52.500 --> 05:54.500
"Tying the knot"
or "Ball and chain".

05:54.600 --> 05:56.600
Have you ever listened to the
words of a wedding ceremony?

05:56.600 --> 05:59.500
Like: "l promise to obey."
Or "Till death do us part."

05:59.600 --> 06:01.600
I'd rather be like stuck
on an island...

06:01.700 --> 06:04.600
...with some weird millionaire, 
hunting me and trying to kill me...

06:04.600 --> 06:05.700
...and trying to escape
than be involved...

06:05.800 --> 06:08.800
...in something with those. That's like 
a time bomb, waiting to explode.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.800
So, what about children?
You do want to make them, no?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.600
- No, no.
- No.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.700
- I don't wanna make them.
- Uh-uh.

06:17.700 --> 06:20.700
I just don't want to be like,
responsible for this kid...

06:20.700 --> 06:22.600
...and hurt their feelings 
and disappoint them.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.800
Yeah, that's what 
happened to our families.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.800
We're both from
divorced families.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.800
We've seen it play out. We don't
need to repeat the pattern.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.600
But anyway, congratulations
on getting married.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.700
That sounds like a really cool 
thing, and to each their own.

06:33.800 --> 06:34.800
Yeah, absolutely.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.800
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas!

06:37.500 --> 06:38.500
Bye-bye.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.500
- Big-bad Brad!
- Hi!

07:04.600 --> 07:06.700
- How are you guys doing?
- Look at this. How are you?

07:06.700 --> 07:08.500
You remember
my girlfriend, Kate.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Hi.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.700
What are you guys
doing for, christmas?

07:12.700 --> 07:15.500
We got the entire
family flying in.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.600
13 airport pick-ups.

07:17.700 --> 07:21.600
4 days of listening
to how gifted my nieces are.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.600
My brother thinks his daughter,
the four year old...

07:25.600 --> 07:27.500
...is gonna be the next, Beyonce.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.600
She's bad and she sucks.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.700
I'm vacationing in tropical
Albany this year...

07:37.700 --> 07:39.600
...with, Tricia's family.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.600
They got us a cot,
which is awesome.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.700
But we'll probably end up sleeping...

07:42.700 --> 07:44.800
...on the musty couch
in the basement with the cats.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.600
All seven of them.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.600
We'll get to be there
the whole week.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.800
Sounds like
a prison sentence.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
Why do you guys put
yourselves through that?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.600
It's, christmas, right,
don't you have to?

07:55.700 --> 07:56.800
We don't need to do it.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.800
We don't.
We don't do it.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.800
- We're done.
- Why, what are you doing?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.500
- We're going to Fiji. Just the two of us.
- Yeah.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.500
Fiji?

08:04.600 --> 08:05.600
Yeah.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.800
Don't your families
get upset?

08:06.800 --> 08:08.800
Not if you tell them 
you're doing charity work.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.500
Like building houses
in third world countries.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.600
Teaching english as a second 
language in, Puerto Rico.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.600
Helping orphans in, Somalia.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.600
Helping, Chinese kids capture lobsters.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.600
Boil them, cut them, clean the 
weird stuff out the middle.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.700
We find it that the more
details you give...

08:25.700 --> 08:27.700
...kinda throws them off the set.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.700
You lie to your families
at, christmas time?

08:30.700 --> 08:33.500
You really can't spell 
families without lies.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.700
Try it.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.799
But don't you
ever feel guilty?

08:38.500 --> 08:40.600
For taking a vacation
on our vacation?

08:40.600 --> 08:41.600
No, not really.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.500
- You do look pretty sexy with a tan.
- Thanks, babe.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
You could take this one.
This one here.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.600
- Like that.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.800
Oh by the way I made a couple's
massage reservation for this weekend.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.600
- You did? That's great.
- Yeah.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.800
I should probably check 
us in online, after this.

09:01.800 --> 09:02.800
I did it.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.700
You checked us in already?
You're the best, sweetheart.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.600
I picked up a pair of those noise 
canceling headphones, you wanted.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.700
- You did not.
- For the next time.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.700
- Oh my God.
- I'm excited.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.600
We should probably sign up for 
the scuba boat as soon as we get there...

09:16.600 --> 09:18.500
I heard it fills up
really quick.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.600
Do you feel like we've
been on this vacation before?

09:21.700 --> 09:25.600
The scuba diving, we did that
in Bali and Costa Rica.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.700
Yeah, but this is Fiji.
We've never been to Fiji.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.700
That's a whole different island.
and the resort there is beautiful,

09:32.700 --> 09:35.600
and the scuba diving
there's gonna be totally different.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.500
It's different water different fish.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.700
It's gonna be really good.
I'm excited.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.700
- lt's gonna be amazing.
- Are you excited?

09:41.700 --> 09:43.700
- I am. I'm really excited.
- I am excited.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.700
- I love you.
- I love you too.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.700
Hey, Mom, merry, christmas.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.700
Yeah.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.700
Listen. Actually I'm sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.800
We're actually heading 
out today to, Burma.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.800
Yeah. That's exactly
the island in, Asia, Burma.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.800
We're inoculating babies there.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.700
Yeah, we'll be helping 
out with these kids.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.800
It's such a great cause, but honestly...

10:25.800 --> 10:29.600
it just sucks that we're not able to 
be there with you and the entire family.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.700
You know how much. I know, mom it's been 
three years since I've been there for, christmas.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.700
I wish I would've
called you sooner.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.600
But, Kate sent all
the gifts and stuff to you.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.600
Okay.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.600
That's Merry Christmas
in Burmese.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.700
All right, I'll tell her.
I love you too. Bye.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.700
You learned "Merry Christmas" in, Burmese.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.600
I gotta take everything
to the next level.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.700
Come on, let's do this.
I'm excited.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.600
Attention, San Francisco
passengers.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.700
All flights
have been grounded...

11:22.700 --> 11:24.600
...due to extreme
weather conditions.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.600
Sir, excuse me.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.800
Well the phone's will be in 
and your flight's not going out.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.800
But what I can do
is get you set up for standby...

11:30.800 --> 11:33.500
...on the first flight
to Fiji tomorrow. Okay?

11:33.600 --> 11:34.700
Tomorrow's not going to be great for us.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.800
We've already scheduled
a couple's massage...

11:36.800 --> 11:39.700
I'm sorry, sir. I don't make
the fog, I deal with it.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.700
The best I can do is get you
guys set up a suite at the, Radisson.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.600
They have lovely accommodations, 
it's right next to the airport.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.700
You promise?
At the, Radisson?

11:48.700 --> 11:50.600
- Did you hear that?
- Brad.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.600
No, no that's terrific.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.600
Would it be possible
to take us out...

11:53.700 --> 11:55.600
and get us, McDonald's as desert?

11:55.700 --> 11:57.600
I'll start missing
flights more often.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.700
With this kind of
red carpet service is available.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.600
- Because that's terrific. A suite.
- Brad, please.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.600
That's not helping, Brad, okay.
Is there another airline...

12:04.600 --> 12:07.700
that you're possibly affiliated with?
Like a sister airline that we can transfer to?

12:07.700 --> 12:10.700
- No, I'm sorry.
- Do you have a cousin airline?

12:10.800 --> 12:13.700
How about an airline that 
your airline's filled out before?

12:13.800 --> 12:17.700
The FAA has ruled that the, Bay
area fog is simply too thick.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.700
No flights are coming in
and no flights are going out...

12:20.700 --> 12:22.700
until at least tomorrow morning.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.800
Let's see how travelers
are coping in all of this chaos.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.500
We have a couple over here.
Excuse me, sir? Excuse me.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.500
Where are you headed
for this, christmas?

12:34.700 --> 12:36.500
We're live on the air.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.700
You certainly look
dressed for a vacation.

12:43.700 --> 12:46.700
We're taking...
And we take the trips.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.700
We'll take a different trip.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.800
What he's trying to say is
that we plan a trip every year.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.500
This is actually
ruining our Christmas.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.700
You must be pretty upset.
Are you visiting friends and family?

13:02.800 --> 13:03.800
This is, Kate.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.700
Hi, mom.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.700
I know, mom. All the flights
were cancelled for today.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.800
- But they're not really...
- Sweetheart It's, my dad.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.600
They're not sure, 
whether or not if it'll be today.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.700
You want me to answer it?
Do I answer or no?

13:16.700 --> 13:18.500
Do I pick it up or not?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.800
Yes, I know. I understand
you have feelings.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.600
What? What do you want me to do? I don't know 
what this means, I don't know what your saying to me.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.600
Alright he's gonna give you a big 
hug when he see's you, mom.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.700
- I'm not hugging anybody.
- He's really excited about the hug.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.700
- Alright we'll see you at noon.
- Noon?

13:36.700 --> 13:38.800
Kate, are you crazy?
Did you just commit us to go?

13:38.800 --> 13:42.600
What did you want me to say?
They saw us on the news.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.600
We're obviously not
inoculating babies in, Burma.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.800
- No...
- We are stuck here.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.800
By the way, what did you say to your dad?

13:47.800 --> 13:50.700
I told my dad that of course 
we'll be going over there.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.600
Don't compare
your situation.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.600
- You kidding?
- There's new stuff...

13:54.600 --> 13:55.700
...that you're missing here, Kate.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.500
My Dad's a unique specific
animal. Your mother's not.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.800
My dad, your mom.
My mom, your dad.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
Great.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.500
We'll see all four families in one day, Kate.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.700
Do you have any idea what this means?
Do you have any idea what you committed us to?

14:06.800 --> 14:09.700
I know exactly
what this means.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
Brad.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.600
Baby.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.600
I don't want to fight.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.800
Honey, I don't wanna fight either.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.600
- I hate this.
- We never fight, honey. I'm sorry.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
I love you.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.700
This is what our families do, you 
know that? This is what happens.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.800
My mother makes me crazy
every time I talk to her.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.600
You're absolutely right.
Here's all we got to do.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.600
We just gotta get through these, Four Christmases...

14:46.600 --> 14:48.800
as quickly and as painlessly as possible.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.800
Exactly. Promise me that no
matter what happens today...

14:52.600 --> 14:53.800
we'll still have each other, right.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.500
- Honey, of course we will.
- Okay.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.600
Hey listen. If one of these
houses gets a little too intense...

15:09.700 --> 15:11.700
- I think we're gonna need a exit strategy.
- Yes.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.600
We'll need a word that both of us know
that means it's time to leave.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.600
What do you think our 
safe word, should be?

15:16.600 --> 15:17.800
It's a good idea.
Mistletoe.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.800
- Mistletoe is really good.
- Okay.

15:20.700 --> 15:24.500
By the way, my father's house
can get particularly uncomfortable.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.700
Please sweetheat, do not feel 
embarrassed if you feel the need...

15:27.700 --> 15:29.700
to pull the rip cord early,
say, Mistletoe...

15:29.800 --> 15:31.800
if this house gets too 
uncomfortable for you.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.600
- Okay.
- Even if we're there for 10 min.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.500
All right, I'll let you 
know where I'm at.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.700
I'm just looking out for you 
on this one. I want you to be cool.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.600
Brad, I'm gonna go see your 
dad and your brothers right now.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.800
Unless you're too weird
with it, then we're out.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.700
- I'm going in.
- And going out would be...

15:47.700 --> 15:50.600
- Mistletoe.
- Done. Let's get out of here.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.800
Brad, we're going in. Let's go.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.600
Son of a bitch.
The TV stars actually came.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.700
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Dad.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.700
Merry Christmas, tiny.
Good to see you.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.700
- Thanks for having us.
- Good to see you.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.800
- Come on in.
- Okay.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.700
Let's... Let's celebrate.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.500
Okay. Sounds good.

16:22.700 --> 16:24.700
That's a lot of presents 
you sent there, boy.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.600
You're trying
to out do us?

16:26.700 --> 16:28.600
The biggest one is 
for you, Howard.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.500
Yeah? What is it?

16:31.500 --> 16:32.600
I'm not gonna tell you.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.700
What, are you crazy?

16:37.800 --> 16:38.700
- Bro.
- Hey, buddy.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.500
Baby!

16:47.800 --> 16:50.800
Kate, these are my brothers:
Denver and Dallas.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.600
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.600
You must be, Orlando's girl.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.700
Orlando?

16:57.800 --> 17:00.800
We're named after the cities
in which we were conceived.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.700
I'm, Denver that's, Dallas.
And this is, Orlando.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.500
Orlando?

17:07.500 --> 17:10.599
My given name is, Orlando.
But I changed it to, Brad.

17:11.700 --> 17:12.700
I'm, Brad.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.800
What?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.599
Well, merry christmas one and all.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.700
- Orderves for anyone.
- Come on.

17:20.599 --> 17:22.500
Who are you trying
to impress, Suze?

17:22.700 --> 17:24.700
We also got beer moses in the back.

17:24.700 --> 17:25.599
Ladies first.

17:26.599 --> 17:27.599
Thank you so much.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.600
What is this?
Is this cheese?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.600
Yeah, spray.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.800
Spray cheese from the famous
family of aerosol cheeses.

17:45.700 --> 17:46.700
Give me a hand.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.700
Here we go.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.600
Do you have something
to say about my wife's cheese?

17:56.700 --> 17:57.800
Hump it! Hump it!

17:57.800 --> 17:59.800
I haven't seen
that move in a while.

17:59.800 --> 18:03.600
Shut it, soldier boy!

18:03.800 --> 18:06.500
The spray cheese!
The spray cheese!

18:06.700 --> 18:08.800
Bring it home, soldier boy.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.700
Oh my, god, honey. I am so sorry
that you had to see that.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.800
Let me apologize for them.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.800
If you wanna say "Mistletoe"
because it's too heavy for you, I get it.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.700
I get it. I totally get it. Don't 
feel weird about that.

18:34.700 --> 18:37.700
If you need to get out of here, you let me
know where your comfort zone is.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.700
Beacause that was weird.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.800
I can not believe you didn't
tell me your real name.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.600
- What are you talking about?
- l just...

18:44.700 --> 18:46.800
It's just crazy to me. We've 
been together for 3 years now

18:47.500 --> 18:49.700
and I don't even know your real name.
doesn't that strike you as a little bit odd?

18:49.700 --> 18:53.500
No, it's not a little bit odd. I 
hated my name, so I changed it.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.500
You don't say hey: "My name used
to be asshole, but it's, Bob."

18:56.600 --> 18:59.600
- You just say: "My name is, Bob."
- Maybe to a stranger on the street...

18:59.600 --> 19:00.800
but to somebody you're 
sharing your life with,

19:00.800 --> 19:02.700
Yeah you tell them your real name.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.700
Sweetheart, I really don't want 
to get into this right now.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.700
By rhe way this is exactly why I was
afraid if we came here.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.700
this is isn't us, it's them.
We're letting them in.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.700
Okay but your real name isn't asshole.
It's like your middle name.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.700
Don't wanna be
blindsided again.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.600
That's very funny. Go ahead
and take a shot at me.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.600
It's bad enough, I have to deal
with those, Neanderthals

19:19.600 --> 19:21.500
but now I gotta take it from you too?

19:21.600 --> 19:24.800
No, you shouldn't. You shouldn't
let them walk over you either.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.700
Kate, they are trained, UFC fighters.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.600
They know pressure
points on people.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.600
But you're twice their size.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.700
They're semi-professional
cage fighters.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.700
Like one person comes out,
one person doesn't.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.600
A cock fighting
but with dudes.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.700
- I thought you said they were personal trainers.
- They're dude cock fighters.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.600
Like that thing you see on the pay-per-view.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.600
Yes exactly. Except they don't
actually get paid for it.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
They mostly just brawl 
in people's backyards...

19:48.700 --> 19:50.700
and then they upload
the footage to, YouTube.

19:50.700 --> 19:54.500
Honey, my childhood was just
like the, "Shawshank Redemption".

19:54.600 --> 19:57.800
Except I didn't have some kind,
older, soft spoken black man...

19:57.800 --> 19:59.600
to share my struggle with.

19:59.700 --> 20:01.800
But you're not
that child anymore, okay?

20:01.800 --> 20:06.500
You're a grown, strong,
confident, successful man.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.700
I really don't want to get into this.

20:08.700 --> 20:12.600
Brad, let me just let you know 
the truth. They're intimidated by you.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.600
What you need to do
is go out there...

20:14.700 --> 20:15.800
and set some
healthy boundaries...

20:16.500 --> 20:19.500
and demand that they respect 
you. You know what I'm saying?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.700
Hey, big city, come to
open up some presents!

20:21.700 --> 20:24.600
- Come on son, we gotta go!
- This is your opportunity.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.600
You can do this, baby.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.700
Right, right.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.700
Okay, gentlemen.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.700
Can we take it down
a notch, please?

20:38.600 --> 20:40.700
I'm not a kid, you can't
talk to me like that anymore.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.600
We're adults.
Do you understand?

20:42.600 --> 20:44.700
I'm a grown man
with hair on my chest, right?

20:44.800 --> 20:47.700
There's gonna be certain boundaries 
that are gonna exist between us.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.800
They might be invisible. I know you 
gentlemen won't be able to see them,

20:52.500 --> 20:55.600
but you're certainly gonna be able 
to respect the fact that they're there.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.600
These boundaries
are not to be crossed.

20:58.700 --> 21:02.700
And if they are crossed, there's
gonna be real consequences to that.

21:06.700 --> 21:07.700
Thank you.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.500
Welcome back, stud!

21:15.600 --> 21:16.600
Don't!

21:16.700 --> 21:17.700
Stop!

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
Stop it!

21:29.700 --> 21:30.800
Come on, can I go in?

21:30.800 --> 21:33.700
No, you boys could get hurt.

21:33.700 --> 21:34.700
Come in!

21:34.700 --> 21:36.500
- Come on!
- Take us in!

21:36.600 --> 21:37.700
- Go!
- Yes!

21:42.600 --> 21:43.600
Get it!

21:46.700 --> 21:47.700
Google me, bitch!

21:48.600 --> 21:48.800
What?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.800
Google me. You might wanna
look me up sometime, Barbara!

21:52.800 --> 21:54.600
No! Dad!

21:54.700 --> 21:55.700
Stop!

21:56.600 --> 21:57.700
Let's open the presents...

21:57.800 --> 22:00.600
so, Orlando can get
to his other, christmases alright.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.800
Let's do it.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.600
Baby.

22:12.700 --> 22:14.600
It's me. It's me.
Are you okay?

22:15.600 --> 22:16.700
Did you break anything?

22:19.700 --> 22:21.600
I am so proud of you.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.600
Orlando, you're closest 
to the tree, you distribute.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.800
Gosh, wasn't it so
hard to find gifts...

22:33.800 --> 22:35.600
under the 10 dollar cap this year?

22:35.700 --> 22:37.600
The first gift is to, Connor.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.700
- The 10 dollar what?
- 10 dollar spending cap.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.600
Uncle Brad and his special
friend Kate, maybe...

22:42.600 --> 22:43.600
Brad?

22:43.800 --> 22:45.600
I'll be your nice uncle...

22:45.700 --> 22:47.700
...after you see what I got you.
Go ahead open it up.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.500
- Brad?
- Yeah.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.700
What?

22:51.800 --> 22:54.600
- X-Box. This is awesome.
- Whoa.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.700
Top shelf for you, pal.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.700
It's got the triple core processor, 
wireless controllers the whole deal.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.800
It was a 10 dollar
spending cap.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.700
How in the hell did you find
an X-Box for under 10 dollars?

23:04.600 --> 23:07.600
Looks like someone's trying to 
show off how much money he makes.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.700
Maybe someone's family
didn't tell him that,

23:09.800 --> 23:10.800
there was a 10 dollar spending cap.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.800
Or maybe if you came home
you'd know crap like that.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.800
Guys can we try
to stay positive here?

23:15.800 --> 23:18.800
What's the problem? We're trying 
to give some gifts to some children.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.600
It's, christmas. Let's keep
the momentum going here.

23:21.600 --> 23:26.600
The next gift is to, Cody
and this is from your dad.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.700
I'm sure this is
a good gift too. Okay?

23:31.800 --> 23:33.500
Dig in there, tear it up.

23:35.700 --> 23:36.800
A flashlight?

23:37.800 --> 23:39.500
That's it?

23:39.800 --> 23:41.700
Why don't you love me,
Daddy?

23:41.700 --> 23:44.800
Okay, okay. Honestly,
I think it's my fault.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.800
I didn't know there was 
a 10 dollar spending cap.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.800
Well my gift from, Santa Claus
better be straight cool.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.700
I have a feeling that your
gift from, Santas 

23:52.700 --> 23:54.700
probably going to ring
around 10 dollars too.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.700
Why? Is, Santa Claus
cheap like my daddy?

23:57.700 --> 24:00.600
No, Santa is dad.
Dad is...

24:01.800 --> 24:02.800
Right.

24:03.800 --> 24:04.800
I don't understand.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.600
What's happening? What's happening?
What's the problem?

24:09.600 --> 24:11.600
There's no, Santa Claus.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.700
You're joking with me, right?
You're kidding me.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.600
They know there's
no, Santa Claus, right?

24:18.700 --> 24:19.700
They do now.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.700
How could you lie to us, Daddy?

24:21.700 --> 24:22.800
There is a Santa Claus.

24:23.500 --> 24:23.800
Cody, come on.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.600
You and Santa Claus
don't love me.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.700
That's not gonna
bring back Santa. That's not...

24:29.700 --> 24:31.700
When he gets hurt inside
and can't get...

24:31.800 --> 24:34.600
...his emotions into words,
he takes to streaking.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.600
Don't worry, he always comes back.

24:38.700 --> 24:40.600
Nobody loves me!

24:42.800 --> 24:45.600
Okay, look.
I'm really, really sorry.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.600
- I just assumed...
- All right. All right.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.600
Let's keep it moving.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.600
I'm starting to lose my balls over here.

24:51.800 --> 24:52.800
All right?

24:54.700 --> 24:57.600
What's this one here?
You're gonna love this, poppy.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.600
That's a satellite dish, Howard.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.600
Why would I want a satellite?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.700
That's not a satellite,
it's a satellite dish.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.800
Terrific. You got so many more
channels and viewing options.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.700
You don't think I get enough channels?

25:09.700 --> 25:11.800
Well, your TV right now
is a radio, so...

25:11.800 --> 25:12.800
Wait.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.600
How much is this gift
gonna cost me a month?

25:17.700 --> 25:19.700
Apparently it's not going to cost you.
We're paying for the services.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.700
- So, nothing actually.
- Wait, wait.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.600
Just because I drive
a combine for a living...

25:24.600 --> 25:26.700
doesn't mean I need me
a fancy pants lawyer son...

25:26.700 --> 25:28.800
- paying the bills for me.
- Okay, you win.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.600
If you want to pay, for 
the stuff, you pay for it.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.600
The installation guy comes on Tuesday, 
he's gonna install it for you.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.800
Cancel it. We install things 
ourselves in this house.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.700
Dad, I think you gonna want
a professional to handle this.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.500
If you think I'll allow
a sex predator...

25:43.700 --> 25:45.800
...in a uniform to wander
around my house...

25:46.600 --> 25:47.700
...and touch my underwear...

25:48.700 --> 25:51.600
You got another thing coming, no.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.800
I'll see you top side in five.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.700
All three on the roof.

25:55.700 --> 25:56.700
- Let's go.
- Okay.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
To her mother.
I gotta take a grumpy.

26:02.700 --> 26:03.700
What don't you...?

26:04.700 --> 26:06.600
You wanna go over
to your mom?

26:07.600 --> 26:11.600
Yeah, okay, come here.
Careful. There you go.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.500
Ain't it nice to have everybody 
home for the holidays?

26:15.600 --> 26:16.800
Yes, it is.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.600
We're gonna make
bologna sandwiches I think.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
Okay, here we go.

26:28.700 --> 26:29.700
Okay.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.800
Take her before
it explodes.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.700
Thank you.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.600
Gotta go and do
some man's work.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.600
You gotta use
a lock nut on that.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.600
I know what I'm doing.
I don't need any lock nut.

26:52.600 --> 26:53.800
Sorry, I know that you major...

26:53.800 --> 26:56.700
...in a satellite dish
installation at, Stanford.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
Yeah.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.700
Great, dude. Mock me
for being educated. That's awesome.

27:02.800 --> 27:04.600
- Hey, Grandpa!
- Hey!

27:05.600 --> 27:06.700
Come play, war with me!

27:07.800 --> 27:09.700
Maybe later, grandpa is busy.

27:11.600 --> 27:14.500
Grandma's boyfriend
plays with me whenever I want.

27:14.700 --> 27:18.600
Your grandmother's boyfriend
is a first class ass sniffer.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.700
You can tell him I said so.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.800
Connor, go get us
some beers, man.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.800
Sounds like you and mom
really turned a corner there.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.700
I don't want to speak ill
of your mother on, christmas.

27:30.700 --> 27:31.600
But...

27:32.600 --> 27:33.800
she's nothing but a 
common street whore.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.800
Okay, that's great.
Nicely said.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.500
What?
What do you call a woman...

27:38.600 --> 27:40.700
...who throws away a career,
abandons her kids...

27:40.700 --> 27:42.600
...and runs off
with another man?

27:42.600 --> 27:44.600
- What are you talking about?
- What do you call her?

27:44.700 --> 27:47.600
Dad, she was a cashier,
that's not really a career.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.700
That would fall in the category of a job, 
and she left you because you wouldn't talk to her.

27:50.700 --> 27:53.800
Stopped spending time with her. You 
completly shut her out of your life.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.600
I fed her, I put a roof over her head
and I never lied to her face.

27:57.700 --> 27:59.700
I spoiled her, that's what I did.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.600
Let that be a lesson to you kids...

28:01.600 --> 28:03.600
about being honest with your wives.

28:03.700 --> 28:07.600
You can't spell "families"
without lies, am I right?

28:07.800 --> 28:09.600
- Amen, Dad.
- Yeah.

28:12.700 --> 28:15.600
What is she like...
two or three months?

28:16.700 --> 28:18.600
- Nine.
- Wow.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.700
- Yeah.
- Nine months.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.500
She's not walking or
taking care of herself by now?

28:23.600 --> 28:26.600
Are you kidding me?
Most days I'm lucky to get...

28:26.600 --> 28:28.600
my boob out of her mouth
so I can shower.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.700
- Yeah.
- Does that hurt?

28:30.700 --> 28:31.700
What, breast feeding?

28:31.700 --> 28:32.700
No.

28:33.700 --> 28:36.700
Maybe at first, but
the nipples get tough.

28:37.700 --> 28:39.600
I can hardly
feel mine anymore.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.500
You wanna flick one?

28:42.700 --> 28:43.700
- No.
- Please.

28:43.700 --> 28:44.700
- No, no.
- Go ahead.

28:44.800 --> 28:48.600
That's okay. I have a set of my 
own. So I'm just gonna pass.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.800
- Sure. Of course.
- But thanks.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.500
Okay, we're all set!

28:53.600 --> 28:54.500
Hey!

28:54.800 --> 28:56.600
The picture's all fuzzy.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.800
Did you get me some
sort of cheap old satellite?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.800
No, it's not a cheap
old satellite.

29:01.800 --> 29:05.500
I just gotta adjust it.
How about now?

29:05.700 --> 29:06.700
Even worse!

29:06.700 --> 29:07.800
I can make it work! Hold on!

29:08.500 --> 29:09.500
How about now?

29:09.700 --> 29:10.700
Dad...!

29:10.700 --> 29:13.700
Could you hold her?
I need to bake another thing.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.600
No, actually... Okay.

29:16.700 --> 29:17.700
Okay.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.500
Come on, you can't break her.

29:19.700 --> 29:20.700
- Okay.
- Yeah.

29:20.700 --> 29:21.800
Okay, you know what...?

29:22.600 --> 29:24.700
It's a satellite, you gotta 
point it up at the satellite.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.600
How about now, is it better now?

29:26.600 --> 29:28.500
No, it's worse.
It's still crappy.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.800
I don't think she likes me.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.700
She likes you fine.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.600
Just give her a chance
to warm up to you.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.600
- How about now?
- Worse. It's worse.

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
Son of a bitch.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.800
Take the damn thing down. I
can do better with my rabbit ears.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.600
I love my rabbit ears!

29:49.600 --> 29:50.800
Can you tell me "hot or cold".

29:50.800 --> 29:52.600
- What?
- Hot or cold.

29:52.600 --> 29:56.500
Hot or cold what? What the hell 
does that mean, hot or cold?

29:57.600 --> 29:59.600
How long until
she warms up to me?

29:59.800 --> 30:01.600
Not long at all.

30:03.700 --> 30:04.800
- Horrible.
- Point it up!

30:04.800 --> 30:06.600
Shut up, and let me work!

30:06.600 --> 30:09.700
I don't want a fancy satellite.
I don't want any kind of satellite.

30:09.700 --> 30:13.500
It's not a satellite, genius!
It's a satellite dish!

30:14.600 --> 30:15.500
Okay.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.800
- Pull the thing and...
- Get off my roof!

30:18.800 --> 30:20.500
Pull the damn thing!

30:34.600 --> 30:35.600
It's too much.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.700
Whatever you're doing,
stop it right now!

30:37.800 --> 30:39.700
- Leave my TV alone!
- I'm fine!

30:42.700 --> 30:43.700
She stopped crying.

30:44.800 --> 30:45.700
I did it!

30:45.800 --> 30:47.700
You idiot! Stop it!

30:49.600 --> 30:51.700
- This is all right.
- Leave my TV alone!

30:53.600 --> 30:54.500
I'm fine.

30:55.800 --> 30:56.800
That's awesome.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.700
Okay, I'm coming up.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.000
Give me back my baby!

31:24.700 --> 31:25.700
Mistletoe.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.500
Mistletoe.

31:37.600 --> 31:39.800
I can't believe I nailed
that baby's head.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.500
I feel kind of bad about that.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.700
That's my brother's kid. You couldn't 
have possibly blown it's, IQ. It's fine.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.800
I did get it to stop 
crying there for a second.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.800
I think it kind of liked me.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.600
Yeah.

31:50.600 --> 31:53.700
Oh my, god! Do you know what happens 
to your nipples after your breast feed?

31:54.700 --> 31:55.800
I don't think I wanna know either.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.500
No, I don't think you do.
It's violent.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.600
- They crack up like tire rubber.
- Okay.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.700
Just so you know, it's a bit of
a cougar den here at my Mom's.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
This is different.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.500
Maybe she has
a new boyfriend.

32:25.700 --> 32:26.800
Merry christmas, mom.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.600
Merry christmas, Kate.
Come on in.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
Merry christmas.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.600
Give me a hug, Kate.

32:35.700 --> 32:36.700
Oh, okay.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.500
Good to see you.

32:39.600 --> 32:40.700
And you must be, Brad.

32:40.700 --> 32:41.600
Mrs. Kincaid.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.500
Call me, Marilyn 
and get over here...

32:44.600 --> 32:46.700
and give me a hug, you big, 
fat, purple teddy bear.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.600
Bring it!

32:48.700 --> 32:50.600
- Yes, yes!
- Hey, merry christmas.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.600
Shit, that feels good.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.600
You're so tall and firm
like a giant oak.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.700
He's tall.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.800
- Brad, this is my aunt, Sarah.
- Hi.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.700
- This is my aunt, Donna.
- Hi.

33:05.700 --> 33:08.600
- Is that genuine leather.
- Nice to meet you, ladies.

33:08.700 --> 33:11.800
The one in the canarian hanging
on your belt is, gram, gram.

33:11.800 --> 33:14.700
I'm sorry, gram, gram, but that's 
my belt. That's attached to me.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.600
Sorry, merry christmas to you.
It's a great sweater.

33:17.800 --> 33:18.800
I get it.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.500
This is the den. Well,
everyone's in here.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.700
I can't believe you came.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.700
- Hi, Courtney.
- Hi, sweetie.

33:29.700 --> 33:32.600
Hey listen, I can't get up, 
Jackson is very gassy...

33:32.600 --> 33:33.800
and I gotta keep
bouncing him.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.800
Okay.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.700
- Well, this is, Brad.
- Hi.

33:37.800 --> 33:38.700
Hi.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.500
I'm, Courtney.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.500
- Brad. merry christmas.
- merry christmas.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.600
And that's granddad

33:46.600 --> 33:48.600
and this is, Courtney's husband, Jim.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.500
- Take, Jackson.
- All right.

33:50.700 --> 33:53.600
He's so good with kids.
Yeah.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.700
- We're gonna try again.
- Well...

33:55.700 --> 33:58.700
Oh I forgot you're too cool for kids.
It cramps your independence.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.600
I never said, I was too cool for kids.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.800
I know you didn't say it.
But you don't have any.

34:03.800 --> 34:07.600
And you have really strong
concrete ideas about not having any.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.600
Well, that's actually not...

34:10.600 --> 34:12.500
You know, I'd rather just not get into it.

34:12.699 --> 34:13.699
Where's, Kasi?

34:13.800 --> 34:16.800
She's outside in the jump-jump
with the rest of the neighbourhood kids.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.699
There's a jump-jump?

34:21.600 --> 34:22.800
Kate always hated the jump-jump.

34:22.800 --> 34:26.600
In the 5th grade, bunch of kids trapped
Kate inside the jump-jump.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.500
- She never got over it.
- I got over it.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.600
They tortured her
for about an hour.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.600
Why would they trap 
you in there that long?

34:34.699 --> 34:35.600
Because she was...

34:36.699 --> 34:37.699
"Cootie Kate".

34:37.699 --> 34:38.699
Courtney.

34:39.600 --> 34:40.600
Who's cootie, Kate?

34:40.699 --> 34:43.800
- She didn't tell you about cootie, Kate?
- Mom, I really don't think this is necessary.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.699
All the kids pretended
that, Kate had cooties...

34:46.699 --> 34:48.500
...and no one talked to her.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.800
If Kate even touched you,
you'd have to wipe it off...

34:50.800 --> 34:53.600
and spray with disinfectant
to get off the cooties.

34:53.699 --> 34:56.699
That sounds like it could be really hurtful.
How long did that go along for?

34:56.699 --> 34:58.700
Not long. I don't 
remember, but it wasn't long.

34:58.700 --> 34:59.800
Seven years. Until 6th.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.700
That was a long time ago.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.800
I'm sure you don't
have cooties now.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.800
Let's test it out.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.500
Ahh... cooties!

35:10.800 --> 35:14.800
Pastor Phil has encouraged us to dispense...

35:14.800 --> 35:17.700
with the commercial
trappings of the holidays.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.600
- Who's, Pastor Phil?
- Mom's new beau.

35:19.600 --> 35:20.700
It's a whole new thing.

35:21.700 --> 35:22.700
So...

35:22.800 --> 35:25.500
what I had in mind
was that...

35:25.600 --> 35:28.600
we would go around 
the room and each of us...

35:28.600 --> 35:31.800
would speak to the spiritual
gifts that we might give.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.700
A verbal gift giving of sorts.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.800
Wait. There's
really no presents.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.700
Kasi.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.500
None that you can see.

35:41.700 --> 35:42.800
Okay, I'll go first.

35:43.800 --> 35:46.700
I would like to give more
of myself to my church...

35:46.700 --> 35:48.600
and to, Pastor Phil.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.700
gram-gram,
would you like to go next?

35:56.600 --> 35:59.700
I could increase the frequency
with which...

35:59.800 --> 36:03.700
...I pleasure, Milton with
my hand and with my mouth.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.600
Did she just say that?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.700
Brad, why don't you go next?

36:13.600 --> 36:15.500
I follow, gram, gram with that...

36:16.700 --> 36:19.700
...hand stuff and what she
does with her... Yeah, okay?

36:20.600 --> 36:21.600
I'd like to umm...

36:22.800 --> 36:24.500
with Kate...

36:25.700 --> 36:26.700
would be too...

36:28.600 --> 36:31.700
Vacationing more frequently
and doing it with, Kate.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.700
That is lovely, Brad.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.700
- He's so well spoken.
- Thank you. Thank you.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.600
Courtney, what would you give?

36:40.600 --> 36:42.600
Well, I'd like
to give myself a gift.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.700
And that is the gift
of being pregnant.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.700
I know that comes with its
own challenges for 9 months...

36:49.700 --> 36:52.600
Iike getting fat and having
people stare at you funny

36:52.700 --> 36:53.700
when you sneak a cig, but.

36:54.700 --> 36:56.700
I'd also like to give
myself another gift.

36:56.700 --> 36:58.800
And that is a scheduled, 
C-section that goes routinely

37:01.700 --> 37:04.600
Don't most women want
to have a natural birth?

37:04.700 --> 37:06.800
Yeah, those women 
who haven't done it before.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.800
Right.

37:10.600 --> 37:11.700
You just come here.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.600
Auntie, Kate will you 
please hold him whilst I..?

37:15.600 --> 37:16.700
What do I do?

37:16.700 --> 37:18.700
You gotta hold him.
Okay, got him?

37:18.700 --> 37:21.800
I'll fix myself here.
There we go.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.700
- What should I do with him?
- See if he made a stinky.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.700
How do I do that?

37:25.800 --> 37:28.600
Just lift up his diaper
and see if he made one.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.600
Oh... Oh yeah there's something in here.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.600
It's a really disgusting...

37:36.700 --> 37:37.600
Jackson...

37:39.600 --> 37:41.600
Your projectile on auntie, Kate.

37:43.700 --> 37:45.800
- I'm gonna vomit.
- Brad, are you okay?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.600
Get him some water.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.700
- I'm about to throw up.
- Oh, God.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.800
I'll get sick. I can't be here.

37:53.700 --> 37:54.700
What do I do?

37:54.800 --> 37:56.800
Take it away from me. 
I'm sorry. I love you.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.700
You gotta get out of here. I can't breathe.

37:59.700 --> 38:00.700
I want to do it too!

38:01.700 --> 38:02.800
- Kate!
- What?

38:08.800 --> 38:11.800
Are you joking me? These are the only 
clothes we have in the entire house?

38:12.700 --> 38:13.700
How's that even possible?

38:14.600 --> 38:17.600
It's not like you ever come around.
You haven't been here in like... Forever.

38:17.700 --> 38:20.600
I can not believe you told him
about "Cootie Kate".

38:20.600 --> 38:22.600
How was I supposed to 
know you hadn't told him?

38:22.600 --> 38:24.700
Like you would tell, Jim you're
"Cootie, Courtney".

38:24.700 --> 38:26.800
Jim and I know everything there 
is to know about each other.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.600
He knows I slept with
the entire water polo team.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.600
Just like I know he
experimented with men.

38:32.700 --> 38:35.700
- I didn't need to know that.
- Listen, Kate my point is, after three years...

38:35.700 --> 38:37.600
I would think that
you and, Brad...

38:37.600 --> 38:39.700
would know a little bit more about 
each other than you already do.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.800
How can you really appreciate
someone for who they are...

38:43.600 --> 38:44.800
until you really know them?

38:51.700 --> 38:52.600
Thank you.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.700
I kind of feel like a
Saudi prince in here.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.700
We're just so glad that
Kate has a boyfriend.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.600
You're the longest relationship
she's ever had with a man.

39:05.700 --> 39:06.700
With a man?

39:34.700 --> 39:35.700
What' is this?

39:53.700 --> 39:54.700
Oh, my God.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.500
Who's that?

40:18.700 --> 40:19.700
That's, Josephine.

40:19.800 --> 40:22.700
Everyone called her, Joe.
She was, Kate's only friend.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.600
Last I heard, Joe coaches
women's wrestling.

40:32.700 --> 40:33.600
Check that out!

40:34.700 --> 40:36.600
- That's, Kate?
- Yeah.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.700
She looks like, Shaq.

40:54.600 --> 40:55.600
Hi, auntie Kate.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.600
- Hi, Kasi.
- What are you doing?

40:59.800 --> 41:02.600
Not much. Do you need
to use the bathroom?

41:02.800 --> 41:04.500
What's this?

41:07.500 --> 41:09.700
That is my
special magic marker.

41:11.800 --> 41:12.800
What?

41:12.800 --> 41:14.800
We not allowed to have 
magic markers in the house.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.700
- I have to tell my mom.
- No. You don't need to tell your mom.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.700
Actually, can I have it back because...

41:23.600 --> 41:24.600
Kasi.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.600
You want this?

41:26.600 --> 41:28.600
This is not a joke,
this is not game.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.600
Auntie Kate needs
her marker back, okay?

41:34.600 --> 41:35.800
Kasi, this is not funny!

42:02.700 --> 42:04.600
Kasi,
please come out of there!

42:04.700 --> 42:06.600
Don't make me
come and get you.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.500
Kasi!

42:09.800 --> 42:10.700
Come on!

42:10.800 --> 42:12.500
Come and get it!

42:35.600 --> 42:36.800
Wait a minute.
Kate went to a fat camp?

42:36.800 --> 42:40.600
Yeah, she lost three pounds.
It only took her all summer.

42:40.700 --> 42:41.700
A pound a month.

42:42.600 --> 42:43.600
Courtney.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.500
Kasi, honey. Please
give me back that marker!

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
Keep away!

42:52.800 --> 42:54.600
Come and get it, old lady!

42:54.600 --> 42:55.600
What?

42:55.600 --> 42:56.700
Keep away! Keep away!

42:56.800 --> 42:57.800
Give it to me!

42:58.600 --> 42:59.600
"Give it to me."

42:59.600 --> 43:00.800
Just give me the marker.
Okay?

43:00.800 --> 43:03.600
"Just give me the marker.
Okay?"

43:04.600 --> 43:06.600
Come and get it!
Sucker!

43:10.700 --> 43:11.700
Get it!

43:16.700 --> 43:17.600
Yeah!

43:18.800 --> 43:19.800
- That's Kate?
- Yes.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.600
Wait a minute. Hold on.
You told me... Who's that?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.700
- That's Kate.
- That's not a boy named, Bjorn?

43:35.700 --> 43:38.600
Can't believe it, Kate is
actually playing with, Kasi.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.700
I've never seen her
play with my kids before.

43:41.700 --> 43:43.700
Hey! Okay!

43:47.600 --> 43:48.600
Mistletoe!

43:50.600 --> 43:52.600
Brad! Mistletoe!

43:53.800 --> 43:55.500
Mistletoe!

43:55.700 --> 43:58.600
- We're so glad you're here, Brad.
- I'm having so much fun.

43:59.700 --> 44:02.700
What did she take so long to
bring you here? Is what I wanna know.

44:21.700 --> 44:23.600
I came here for a marker...

44:23.800 --> 44:26.600
and I'm not leaving
without one!

44:45.800 --> 44:46.700
Kasi!

44:49.600 --> 44:52.600
That marker in your mouth,
I peed on it!

45:32.500 --> 45:33.500
Hey,hey!

45:34.700 --> 45:36.800
Sweetheart you never told me
you went to a fat camp.

45:37.700 --> 45:39.600
Okay it was called, "Get fit camp".

45:39.600 --> 45:42.500
I can't believe my family is showing 
you all the pictures of my childhood.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.600
You know what my favorite ones 
are though, of when you're a baby...

45:44.600 --> 45:46.700
'cause it looks almost like you 
were almost meant to be a twin...

45:46.800 --> 45:48.700
- but you ate the other baby in the womb.
- Brad.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.700
- That's why you're so powerful.
- Stop.

45:50.700 --> 45:53.700
Because you ate your twin sister,
and you took all of her powers.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.500
- Cut it out.
- Baby, I love you.

45:55.700 --> 45:59.700
It doesn't bother me if you
were a really abnormally large child...

45:59.800 --> 46:01.600
with lesbian tendencies, 'cause
if that was your journey...

46:01.700 --> 46:04.600
- then I'm cool with it.
- What are you saying, lesbian tendencies?

46:04.700 --> 46:07.700
- I saw the pictures of, Joe.
- Joe wasn't gay.

46:07.800 --> 46:11.700
Haircuts don't lie.
What did you do with Joe...

46:11.700 --> 46:13.800
Iike play baseball
and ride motorcycles?

46:13.800 --> 46:16.700
We're just kids.
She was really imaginative.

46:16.700 --> 46:19.700
We played in the basement.
She had this game: "Sun tan".

46:19.700 --> 46:22.600
We pretended we're on the
beach, she'd take lotion...

46:22.600 --> 46:24.800
she never wanted me 
to burn, so she would rub it...

46:26.600 --> 46:29.600
Okay, listen and look 
at me. You're better kisser for it.

46:29.800 --> 46:33.700
All I'm saying to you is, it's not fun when
the shoes on the other foot, right.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.800
You shouldn't have been so shitty 
with me with the whole, Orlando stuff.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.700
when you have so many
skeletons in your own closet, right.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.600
Do not throw rocks when
you live in the house of, Joe.

46:42.800 --> 46:43.800
Okay, I see your point.

46:43.900 --> 46:46.600
I love you.
I'll see you in a little bit.

46:51.700 --> 46:52.700
Mom.

46:53.800 --> 46:55.800
I really need to talk
to you for a sec.

46:55.800 --> 46:59.500
Kate, I don't have time for this. I don't
wanna be late for, Pastor Phil.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.500
But I just...

47:00.800 --> 47:02.600
But I just... I kinda want 
to talk about this now.

47:02.600 --> 47:05.600
Well if it's important now, it'll be
important after church, right?

47:06.800 --> 47:07.800
Well yeah but...

47:07.800 --> 47:10.700
Clean yourself up a little,
this is a nice church.

47:22.700 --> 47:24.700
And now...

47:25.600 --> 47:29.700
...the, Pastor Phil!

47:30.500 --> 47:33.800
Hello. There's a new born King.
Hallelujah!

47:34.800 --> 47:36.600
Hallelujah!

47:36.800 --> 47:38.700
Praise Him!
Hallelujah!

47:39.700 --> 47:42.700
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Talk to Him, lady!

47:44.600 --> 47:46.500
Glory to the new born King!

47:47.800 --> 47:49.500
Hallelujah!

47:52.800 --> 47:53.700
Please be seated.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.600
I've been given a note.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.700
The, Walshes who
performed the role...

48:01.700 --> 48:04.600
of, Mary and Joseph
for the last three years...

48:04.600 --> 48:07.000
and done a great job of it, they had 
some food that didn't agree with them.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.600
So, we're gonna need 
a pair of volunteers...

48:09.600 --> 48:11.600
to perform the roles
of, Mary and Joseph.

48:15.600 --> 48:16.600
You should do it.

48:16.700 --> 48:17.600
What?

48:17.700 --> 48:20.700
No, I won't get in front
of a bunch of strangers.

48:20.700 --> 48:23.700
You're staged trained. You
played Pippin in High School.

48:23.800 --> 48:26.800
No. I wasn't Pippin,
I was in Pippin.

48:27.600 --> 48:30.600
I played a tree because I had a bad 
stage fright, do you remember this?

48:30.600 --> 48:33.700
I know this seems like I'm putting you
on the spot and in fact I am.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.700
Honey, Pastor Phil needs you.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.700
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Do I have a volunteer?

48:39.700 --> 48:41.600
Or do I still need
a volunteer?

48:43.600 --> 48:44.800
Kate will play
the, Virgin Mary.

48:44.800 --> 48:45.800
What?

48:45.800 --> 48:47.800
Hallelujah! The cure of the world!

48:47.800 --> 48:49.600
I just said I wouldn't.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.600
Hallelujah! Kate, you stand up!

48:52.700 --> 48:53.800
Stand up, please!

48:54.600 --> 48:57.700
Look at the joy you've brought
to this congregation, Kate...

48:57.700 --> 48:59.600
by your volunteering
to be, Mary.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.700
Hello. I still need a, Joseph.

49:03.700 --> 49:04.700
Brad be, Joseph.

49:04.800 --> 49:07.600
I'm not staged trained.
I never played Pippin.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.700
You don't have to give the performance.
You just have to get up there.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.600
- because I don't wanna be alone.
- It's not gonna happen.

49:12.700 --> 49:13.800
Oh rub a pon-pon, Brad, you stand up!

49:14.800 --> 49:16.600
You are a part of this, Brad!

49:35.700 --> 49:38.600
Listen to me, Brad. I'm going to really 
need you to look out for me up there.

49:38.700 --> 49:41.600
Because I'm starting
to get like really nervous.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.700
- That stage fright thing.
- How do I look?

49:45.500 --> 49:47.700
- What do you think?
- You look fine. I'm trying to get...

49:47.800 --> 49:50.500
My man's skirt, is it
short or is it okay?

49:50.700 --> 49:51.700
- Honestly.
- It's a little short.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.700
Okay here's, Jesus.

49:54.800 --> 49:56.600
They don't use a doll?

49:57.600 --> 49:59.500
- Here are your scripts.
- Scripts?

49:59.700 --> 50:01.700
- I'm not ready for scripts...
- Hi, Jesus.

50:01.800 --> 50:03.700
No one ever told me
there's gonna be lines...

50:03.800 --> 50:06.600
- Hi, Jesus.
- Actually, his name's, Bernard.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.600
Okay.
Hi, Bernard.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.600
Okay, I got lines. I gotta
try to get my voice ready.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.700
Red leather. Yellow leather.
Red leather. Yellow webber.

50:14.700 --> 50:16.500
This is a good baby.

50:16.700 --> 50:18.500
Look at this baby.

50:18.700 --> 50:21.600
Baby, baby Jesus
is really kind of cute.

50:21.800 --> 50:24.600
This child is a blessing
to the both of us.

50:24.800 --> 50:25.800
Really?

50:26.700 --> 50:28.700
What, do you think
I should do it bigger?

50:28.800 --> 50:32.500
Should I do it maybe like, "This child's
a blessing for the both of us.

50:32.600 --> 50:33.800
But not angry. Inspired.

50:33.800 --> 50:36.700
Oh, my God. There's so many
different ways to play this thing.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.800
Can I ask you
a question seriously?

50:38.800 --> 50:41.600
My wife is pregnant,
but it's not my child.

50:41.600 --> 50:44.600
But do you think I'm cool with it because
god's the one that got her pregnant?

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
Are we ready
to see the result...

50:50.600 --> 50:52.500
of that immaculate conception?

50:52.700 --> 50:54.500
Hallelujah!

50:54.600 --> 50:56.600
Brad, I don't feel good.

50:56.800 --> 50:58.600
Maybe you should
hold the baby.

50:58.600 --> 51:00.700
Sweetheart, I gotta get ready.

51:00.700 --> 51:03.500
Just remember,
acting is reacting.

51:03.700 --> 51:06.500
And Joseph and Mary,
went up from, Galilee...

51:06.600 --> 51:07.800
and out of the city
of, Nazareth.

51:08.500 --> 51:12.500
Okay, find your truth.
I'll blow the roof of this bitch.

51:18.700 --> 51:19.600
Brad.

51:20.600 --> 51:21.600
I can't do this.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.700
Check it out, baby.
They're digging my walk.

51:31.700 --> 51:35.700
Because there was no room in 
the inn, they stayed in the stable.

51:38.600 --> 51:41.500
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

51:41.500 --> 51:42.700
and placed him
in a manger.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.800
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

51:56.800 --> 51:59.600
and placed him in a manger.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.600
Put it, in it.

52:06.800 --> 52:08.700
Brad, help me swaddle.

52:08.700 --> 52:10.800
I've gotta save my line,
we're losing the audience.

52:10.800 --> 52:12.600
It's deadlier out there.

52:12.700 --> 52:13.700
Come on, Mary!

52:16.700 --> 52:19.500
This child is a blessing
to the both of us.

52:20.700 --> 52:21.600
Amen!

52:22.700 --> 52:23.700
That's right!

52:27.800 --> 52:28.800
Your line.

52:31.600 --> 52:32.600
I forgot my line.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.500
- What?
- I forgot my line.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.800
Thank goodness
I memorize yours too.

52:38.600 --> 52:39.700
We shall name him, Jesus.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.600
Glory to, god!

52:44.800 --> 52:47.800
And peace on earth
to the highest point on earth!

52:52.600 --> 52:54.700
This thing isn't big
enough to swaddle him.

52:54.800 --> 52:56.800
Someone's got to give
a performance.

52:56.800 --> 52:59.700
I'm nervous. I can't feel my
legs. Please don't do this to me.

52:59.700 --> 53:01.700
It'd appear that my wife is better at...

53:02.600 --> 53:05.700
making babies than
swaddling them, no? Yes?

53:09.600 --> 53:12.500
Brad, you're wearing the
swaddle cloth on your belt.

53:12.600 --> 53:16.700
Woman, do your job
and swaddle this baby!

53:16.700 --> 53:20.500
Brad, I can't. You're wearing
the swaddle around your belt!

53:20.500 --> 53:23.600
Enough! This child's
life is now in jeopardy.

53:23.600 --> 53:26.600
Unfit mother, give me this baby.

53:29.600 --> 53:34.600
And l, Joseph,
shall swaddle this baby!

53:35.600 --> 53:39.800
And l, Joseph,
will protect this child.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.600
Forgive her, son...

53:42.800 --> 53:47.500
for she knows not
what she's done!

53:53.700 --> 53:54.700
Yeah!

54:02.800 --> 54:03.800
Hallelujah!

54:03.800 --> 54:05.800
That's the message
of, christmas.

54:07.700 --> 54:08.700
Hallelujah!

54:12.700 --> 54:13.700
Hallelujah!

54:16.800 --> 54:18.500
Brad, that was...!

54:20.600 --> 54:23.700
# All is calm #

54:24.500 --> 54:27.600
# All is bright #

54:27.800 --> 54:34.700
# Round young
Virgin Mother and Child #

54:35.600 --> 54:41.600
# Holy infant
so tender and mild #

54:42.500 --> 54:44.700
I know how, Celine Dion
feels after one of those shows,

54:44.700 --> 54:46.800
because she gives so much, it's not like
you're getting a lot back.

54:46.800 --> 54:49.800
- 'cause I got a lot back to.
- Celine Dion. You feel like, Celine Dion?

54:49.800 --> 54:51.800
How do you calm down
of a such a high?

54:51.800 --> 54:53.600
It's difficult to do that.

54:53.700 --> 54:55.700
I can't believe you threw me down...

54:55.700 --> 54:57.600
in front of the entire congregation.

54:57.700 --> 54:59.000
You were just thinking 
about yourself up there.

54:59.500 --> 55:01.600
I was thinking about
the entire show.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.700
And quite frankly 
with you, Kate, I think I...

55:02.700 --> 55:04.600
I brought the whole thing home.

55:04.600 --> 55:05.600
- My God.
- I did.

55:05.700 --> 55:07.700
- ls this how it's gonna be with us?
- ls this how it's gonna... What's..?

55:07.700 --> 55:09.800
- What are you saying?
- I'd like to know...

55:09.800 --> 55:11.700
you'll be there for me in a crisis.

55:11.700 --> 55:13.800
If we're on a plane,
and it  was going down.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.600
and I was passed out and I say,

55:15.600 --> 55:16.700
"Everyone needs to put 
on your oxygen mask."

55:16.800 --> 55:19.700
I would like to know that were gonna 
put mine on before you put your own. You know?

55:20.700 --> 55:23.600
I wouldn't and the, FAA wouldn't
want me to do it either.

55:23.700 --> 55:25.700
- I'm not... FAA?
- lf you'd listen...

55:25.700 --> 55:27.800
- What?
- Do you ever listen to the stewardesses?

55:28.500 --> 55:30.800
Or are you too busy moving your, BlackBerry 
and having them tell you to shut it off?

55:31.500 --> 55:33.700
- I listen to the stewardesses.
- When they say...

55:33.700 --> 55:36.700
...that you're supposed to put
your mask on in case of an emergency...

55:36.800 --> 55:38.800
before you try to help out a child 
or an unfit adult next to you.

55:39.600 --> 55:40.800
- I've heard her.
- Because lf you pass out...

55:40.800 --> 55:43.700
you're not helping anybody.
"Put the mask on this one."

55:43.700 --> 55:46.600
Now I'm passed out. Now I'm 
not living I won't help anybody.

55:46.600 --> 55:47.600
It's not the point I'm trying to make.

55:47.700 --> 55:49.800
What is the point? Sweetheart I'm 
sorry, maybe I got this wrong.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.500
What's your point?

55:52.800 --> 55:55.800
I feel like we're not really connecting.
It's like you're not even present.

55:55.800 --> 55:58.600
I have been present.
I've been here all day.

55:58.700 --> 56:00.700
We've been doing things
alongside each other

56:00.800 --> 56:03.500
but I'd like for us to do
somethings together.

56:03.800 --> 56:06.600
Kate, I that you're upset
with your family...

56:06.600 --> 56:08.500
and I think you're 
taking it out on me.

56:08.600 --> 56:10.600
They've been
my family for years.

56:10.600 --> 56:13.600
This is not about my family,
this is about you and me.

56:13.700 --> 56:14.700
I just...

56:15.600 --> 56:17.000
I just want something different for us.

56:17.800 --> 56:19.700
- Merry christmas.
- Mom!

56:20.700 --> 56:22.800
- God I've missed you!
- Good to see you, Mom!

56:22.800 --> 56:23.800
It's been so long.

56:24.800 --> 56:26.800
- And you must be, Kate.
- Yes.

56:27.700 --> 56:29.500
She's a darling.

56:29.800 --> 56:32.600
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.
- Oh It's so wonderful to meet you.

56:32.600 --> 56:34.600
- Should I call you...
- Just call me, Paula.

56:34.600 --> 56:35.700
- Just, Paula.
- Okay.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.800
I am so glad you came.

56:38.700 --> 56:40.700
You've been
taking good care of him.

56:40.700 --> 56:42.600
Certainly hasn't missed many meals.

56:42.600 --> 56:44.600
- That's great.
- He likes a snack.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.600
- I do like the snack.
- Yes, he does.

56:46.600 --> 56:47.600
Come on in and relax.

56:47.700 --> 56:50.600
I've fixed all of your
favorite dishes, Bradford.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.600
Denver and Susan
are watching TV.

56:52.600 --> 56:54.700
Let's sit here and 
catch up for a minute.

56:54.700 --> 56:56.800
- Your house is beautiful.
- Oh thank you.

56:57.500 --> 56:58.600
This is gorgeous.

56:58.600 --> 57:00.700
Well you knew, Bradford lived
with me after the divorce.

57:00.700 --> 57:03.600
Denver and Dallas were more
comfortable with, Howard.

57:03.600 --> 57:05.800
But, Bradford was
the more sensitive type.

57:06.500 --> 57:08.600
- Okay you know I was thinking...
- Oh we were just best friends.

57:08.600 --> 57:09.600
Just inseparable.

57:10.600 --> 57:12.700
My god, he breastfed
until he was five.

57:12.700 --> 57:14.700
Thought l was going to have
to take you to college.

57:14.700 --> 57:15.700
Okay, I think 
we've had enough...

57:15.700 --> 57:17.700
The only one who 
was on my tits more...

57:17.700 --> 57:19.700
was a professor that 
I dated after his father.

57:19.700 --> 57:21.600
Could you not say "tits", please?

57:21.600 --> 57:24.600
- Hey, kids.
- Okay this is, Darryl.

57:24.800 --> 57:26.600
Hi, nice to meet you.

57:26.600 --> 57:28.700
It is so nice to meet you,
young lady.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.600
And always great
to see you, big guy.

57:32.600 --> 57:34.700
Hey, how was traffic
getting out here, huh?

57:34.800 --> 57:38.500
You know what, can I get your gas 
money? I'd like to get your gas money.

57:38.600 --> 57:40.800
Actually, I don't need you
to get my gas money.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.800
Thank you. I actually make
a lot more than you do.

57:42.800 --> 57:45.800
- So, no thank you.
- Bradford, be nice.

57:46.700 --> 57:47.800
It's okay, sweetie.

57:50.800 --> 57:51.800
Look...

57:52.700 --> 57:53.700
Brad...

57:54.700 --> 57:56.700
I'm not trying
to be your father.

57:56.700 --> 57:57.800
You already got one of those.

57:59.600 --> 58:01.700
I'm just hoping for a 
chance to be your friend.

58:02.700 --> 58:05.600
You were my friend, Darryl.
You were my best friend.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.800
We grew up together,
we rode bikes together.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.800
we used to smell
each other's hands.

58:09.800 --> 58:12.500
But now you're sleeping with my 
mom and it's a little bit weird for me

58:12.600 --> 58:13.700
can you appreciate that?

58:13.800 --> 58:16.800
I never had a sexual thought
about your mom until I was 30.

58:16.800 --> 58:19.700
Can you leave it alone. You can't 
be my friend anymore.

58:19.700 --> 58:21.700
You can't be sleeping
with my mom...

58:21.700 --> 58:24.600
- and still be my friend, okay?
- I'm thirsty, is anybody else thirsty?

58:24.700 --> 58:25.700
Kate, what can
I get you to drink?

58:25.700 --> 58:26.800
- I'm good.
- Look, your mother...

58:26.800 --> 58:29.700
- is a very sexual being, Bradford.
- She's a very what?

58:29.700 --> 58:30.800
She's a great lover.

58:30.800 --> 58:33.700
Say that again and I'm gonna 
bust your mouth open.

58:33.700 --> 58:36.800
Hey, look it. This is, christmas
and we're not gonna go there.

58:37.500 --> 58:39.700
Kate has been kind enough
to send us some games.

58:39.700 --> 58:42.800
We are gonna play them
and we're gonna have fun. Okay?

58:51.800 --> 58:53.800
Why are you staring at me 
when you eat the wings?

58:53.800 --> 58:55.700
That's... uncomfortable.

58:58.700 --> 59:00.600
Oh, Conner honey 
don't eat those brownies.

59:00.600 --> 59:02.600
Those are grandmothers
special brownies.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.800
Kate, could you be a lamb
and explain the rules?

59:05.800 --> 59:08.700
Of course. So, you try to
get your team mate...

59:08.800 --> 59:10.600
to say the word
on the top of the card...

59:10.600 --> 59:12.700
but you can't say any 
of the words listed beneath.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.800
And if you say any
of the taboo words...

59:14.800 --> 59:16.700
- then you get buzzed.
- Okay.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.500
That makes sense?

59:18.500 --> 59:20.800
I'm so excited to have you
all here to play this game together.

59:20.800 --> 59:22.600
It's gonna be so much fun.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.600
Hey, it's good to have
my friend back.

59:26.700 --> 59:28.500
So, who wants to go first?

59:28.500 --> 59:29.500
- I'll go.
- Okay.

59:29.500 --> 59:31.500
Brad, why don't you
buzz your mom...

59:31.600 --> 59:33.700
- and then I'll do the timer.
- Okay.

59:33.700 --> 59:34.700
Thanks.

59:36.700 --> 59:38.600
On your mark, get set, go!

59:39.800 --> 59:42.600
Okay, this is a town in, France.

59:42.800 --> 59:43.800
What?

59:43.800 --> 59:46.500
- You can't say, "France" it's on the.
- You don't have to buzz me like that, Brad.

59:46.600 --> 59:47.800
It's the same, loud for everybody.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.600
It's okay sweetie, just 
do the next card.

59:51.600 --> 59:52.600
Okay.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.600
This is me, I'm a...

59:54.800 --> 59:55.800
Cradle robber.

59:55.800 --> 59:57.700
- What did he say?
- Keep going.

59:57.800 --> 59:59.700
Don't worry about it.
You're a therapist, keep going.

59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.800
- No, no, not Capricorn but...
- a, Libra.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.800
Yes!

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
It's fun.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.600
Okay.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.700
This is what you dripped on me?

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.700
Ohh, wax!

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.800
No, after that.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.500
It's brown.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.800
Okay make this stop, please.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.800
Ohh, oh, chocolate.

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.700
- No, before that! After the wax!
- Oh my god.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.600
- The syrup!
- Yes!

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.800
Way sticky dude, I 
would not recommend that.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600
- Okay.
- Okay, time.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:29.800
Time.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.600
- Good job. Good job.
- We only got two.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.700
Who wants to go next?

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.600
- We'll go.
- Okay, great.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.700
I'll do the buzzer.

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:41.700
Are you gonna actually 
eat while you play that?

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.800
- Just flip the tube.
- Excuse me?

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:44.800
Flip the tube.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.700
Okay. On your mark,
get set, go!

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.600
- Capital of, China.
- Hong Kong.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600
Yes.

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.700
Thing next to your bed
on the night stand.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.700
- A sock.
- Yes.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.700
I helped you come up
with this, when you were drunk...

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.800
and came home from
the bar last, thursday.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.600
- Alibi.
- Yes.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.800
Alright, the thing I'm not
allowed to wear to, supercross.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500
- Mini skirt.
- Yes!

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.500
Me and you dry humping
on the beach.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.700
- A screensaver.
- Yes, baby!

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.600
This game is so easy.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.700
The only man I'm allowed
to cheat on you with.

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.700
- John Grisham.
- Yes!

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.600
- Mexican dude.
- Ricardo Montealban.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.500
- Yes!
- Time.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.500
- Right here. Right here!
- Come on!

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.700
Okay, this is like
an animal attack video.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.700
Guys there's other people 
on this table, uncomfortable.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.500
Stop. Oh, God.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.600
You guys got a lot.
How many was that?

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.700
- Seven.
- Seven.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.600
- Pollie, can you do the buzzer?
- Oh, yeah!

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.700
We can do this, baby.
You ready?

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.700
Yeah.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.600
Okay let's light a fire. Let's light a fire.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.500
- Ready? Go!
- Okay.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:50.700
This is the thing, I'm most 
scared of in the whole world.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.700
- Snakes.
- No, no, no.

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.700
- The thing I'm most scared of.
- Jump-jumps! 4 year-olds.

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.700
More than anything, this
scares me to my core.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.600
You got to come up with 
a differnet... Use a lifeline.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.600
- Ask the audience
- Spiders, Brad. I'm scared of spiders.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.700
Sweetheart, you don't 
have to say the answer.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.500
You can say an "eight-legged
animal" or a "superhero"...

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.800
- Can't say superhero!
- Mom, I'm not actually the one with the...

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.700
Try again.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.500
Okay, in high-school,
my senior year spring break...

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.600
I was in Cancun, and I was wearing 
this bikini top, I'd lost all this weight...

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.700
- Tourists. Skinny.
- No, no, no.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.700
- Thin?
- No, I was standing at the bar.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.600
- I was shaking around...
- Dancer.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.700
- My stuff fell out and then all the bar tenders...
- Your what fell out?

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.800
My stuff fell out.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.600
Everybody would call me 
when I went to the bar and say

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.600
"Oh, here comes..."

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800
Peek-a-boo.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.700
Peek-a-boo.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.600
Okay, honey, you can say,
like, "look" or...

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.700
- Can't say "look".
- Okay, mom I'm not the one with the card.

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:44.800
I'm giving examples.
I have a thing here.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.600
- You see this...
- Can't say, "see"!

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.800
I'm explaining the game.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.500
Can't say "game"!

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.800
Mom, the answer's been said.
She said the answer.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.800
- Let's just do the next one.
- Okay.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.700
- Let's... you know?
- I get it.

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:58.700
Okay, so this is something
that you would eat...

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.700
- and you put it on a barbecue and...
- Chicken.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:02.700
- It's my favorite.
- Beef.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:03.800
You can't say, "beef"!

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.700
Mom, I'm not the 
one saying the things!

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.600
- Do you get that? Just shush.
- You can't say, "shush."

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.800
Okay, Mom,
I can say "shush."

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.700
- You can't say "shush."
- Okay Lets just move on... Kebab.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600
It's kebab.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.700
It says I can't say "shish"!

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.800
Shish. Shish. Shish.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.700
And I could say it, 
because, I don't have it.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.700
and that's why, there's this thing
here so that I can't see what it is.

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:24.500
Let's just move on.
Let's just move on.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.700
Our time's up.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.700
What's this attitude, Brad?

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.600
I don't have an attitude.
I've shut down.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.800
She buzzes me,
I'm trying to explain to you...

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:36.800
how to play the game, you 
obviously don't understand

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.600
the best ways to play the
game and I'm shutting down.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.600
I wanna talk to you
about something.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.800
Baby, I know what you want 
to talk to me, about me.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800
You do?

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.600
I don't want you to apologize
for it because, love...

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.500
means never having to say that your, 
sorry. You know what I mean?

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.500
For the record,
I do forgive you.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.700
But the thing is when you're
playing a board game...

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.600
you shouldn't go so conceptual, 
you do want to go a lot more literal.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.700
- Look how else will you know...?
- No, Brad.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.700
I took a pregnancy test today.

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.700
You took what?

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.600
I took a pregnancy test today.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.700
At my mom's house.
It was in my sister's bag...

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.600
I was in the bathroom, and
I'd been a couple of days late

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.600
so I just thought I should
probably take a test.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.700
- Honey, you pulled the goalie?
- What?

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.900
You can't pull the goalie without checking 
with your team mate, this is insane.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.800
I did not pull the goalie. That's not
what this conversation is about.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:42.800
What are you talking about? 
What am I missing here?

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.800
Relax, Brad. It was negative.
I'm not pregnant.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.800
Well jeez, why don't you just hit
me with that right from the start?

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.800
Instead of making me take laps
around the anxiety pool.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.600
What is this reaction?

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.600
Listen, If there's one 
thing we've learned

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.600
by being forced to being
around our families today

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.700
it's about the dangers
of procreating.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.700
Besides, that's not the 
things that we want in life.

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.700
Brad, I realized it today.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.500
I thought for sure, I'd 
always known that

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.700
I didn't want to have kids
and I took this test,

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.800
I'm waiting to see if it's
positive or negative

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.800
and I thought, 
for just a second. I felt...

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.600
different. You know?
I felt hopeful.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.600
Like maybe it would 
just happen and

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.600
we'd be forced to get 
over all of our fears.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.800
We have spent so 
much of our relationship 

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.600
creating all these boundaries you 
know, and making sure that 

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.800
we don't limit ourselves
with responsibility...

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.500
and obligation, and I don't 
wanna live like that anymore.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.700
Because that's not loving at all.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.700
- ls that an eighties song?
- No, Brad.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.700
- Your throwing, eighties songs at me?
- I'm tired of being one foot in.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.700
I want us to be open,
to love each other...

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.800
however it's going to be.
and if one day that means...

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.800
we get married or
if we have kids one day

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.800
I feel like that's okay.
I wanna be in a relationship...

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.600
that goes where 
it needs to go.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.700
Okay. And I'd like the 
relationship to go to, Fiji.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.800
Brad, this is very important.
I wanna have this conversation.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.700
I don't want to have this conversation.
I don't wanna have it.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.800
I feel the same way that
I did when we first met,

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.600
and I've been honest 
the whole time.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.700
I don't want a 
conversation about it

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.600
because I don't 
want those things.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.800
Okay.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.600
It's okay, you 
don't have to come in.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.500
Sweetheart, I'm not going to make 
you go into the house by yourself.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.500
I'm fine. I'll just have my sister
drive me back to the city.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.600
We'll go in there together
and I'll drive you home.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.700
I'm not gonna go
and in there and pretend

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.700
we're something that we're 
not, Brad. I can't do that anymore.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.700
Baby, listen to me, please.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.700
Okay let's not over 
react to this situation here.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.600
I'm not over 
reacting, Brad. I get it.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.800
I'm the one changing
the rules.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.700
and If you don't want to change
them with me, I understand.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.500
I just can't do this anymore.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.500
Honey?

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.800
Coming in?

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.600
Hey, Dad.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.700
She made it!

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.500
Auntie, Kate!
Auntie, Kate!

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.800
Merry christmas again!

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.700
Hi, Kasi.
Merry christmas.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.600
Come see the cool stuff
grandpa, Creighton got me!

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.600
Okay.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.800
Hi, I'm, Cheryl. I'm
your dad's girlfriend.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.500
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Excuse me.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:11.800
- Hey, Kate!
- Hi, Mom.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.800
I got a, Dora the Explorer backpack...

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:19.600
a matching, Dora thermos,
a big girl necklace...

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.800
and princess shoes!

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.500
Hey, guys!

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.500
Hi, Auntie, Kate.
Where's, Brad?

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.700
Kasi, why don't you go
tell grandpa thanks...

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.800
for all your new toys?

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.600
You'd better go or
I'm going to tickle.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.500
Go!

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.800
This is amazing.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.700
Dad and Mom
in the same room?

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.600
They hated each other.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.700
Well they've been getting together
for stuff since, Kasi turned one.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.600
It must be really nice
for, Kasi.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.500
It's really nice for everyone.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:00.700
- Where is, Brad?
- He's not going to make it.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.600
But, If it's all the 
same to everybody

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.700
I'd really just rather
not talk about it.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.800
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
- It's okay.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.600
It's not something I want
to get into right now.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.800
Sorry, we won't talk about him.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:18.500
I have a great idea!
Internet dating.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.000
You should do it. It's great.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.700
You just pay 20 bucks,
and you put in your profile.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.700
Susan, next door, did it and she 
found her husband that way.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.700
It's great.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:28.700
He doesn't have a job
yet but they're working on it.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.800
You should totally do it!

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.500
- I'll think about that.
- Yes.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.500
I'm gonna take a 
minute and just.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.600
Okay. I got your back.
Gotcha.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.800
Thanks.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:04.700
Hi, kiddo.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.600
Hey, Dad.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.800
Did, Brad leave 
to get a jumpstart

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.700
on inoculating babies
in, Burma?

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.800
What?

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.700
Maybe he's making
sock monkeys

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.700
for foster kids.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:24.700
Or weaving ponchos
for pregnant women

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:25.800
in the, Yucatan?

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.700
So, I guess you knew
we were lying?

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:31.700
Oh, boy.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.800
Unfortunately, I've had
a lot of experience

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.600
bending the truth
to avoid my family.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.800
And I'll tell you, honey.
I would give anything...

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.700
to have that time
back again.

01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:50.700
I would too.

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.700
It's taken me a lot of years

01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:00.800
and several divorces
to learn that

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.800
nothing really beats
being honest.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.600
Honest about who you are,
what you need...

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.500
all the rest tends
to work itself out.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:16.600
I was honest...

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:18.700
and I think he was too.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.700
It just wasn't what 
I wanted to hear.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.800
Cheryl made the 
dressing I like so much

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.800
and I did some of the 
cooking too, I even

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.800
I put the ice cubes
in the glasses

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.700
and salt in the saltshakers.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.500
All right, well.

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.600
Not long ago, I wouldn't
have been able to...

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.700
to put this group
of people together...

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.600
in my wildest imagination.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.600
The changes we've 
all been through

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.700
the little hurts we've 
given each other

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.600
we hope we're 
forgiven for them.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.600
We thank you, dear, lord

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.500
because there's nothing
more important than family.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.600
 - Amen.
 - Amen.

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:26.700
Amen.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.800
What the hell
do you want?

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.700
You forgot your tampons?

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:57.500
No, I didn't forget anything.

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.600
I just came by to see you.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:02.700
What for?

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.600
You already destroyed
my, TV and family room.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.800
You want to bust up
my kitchen as well?

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.700
Look, I'm sorry
about that, Dad.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:11.700
I didn't mean to do all of that, 
I was actuall just trying to...

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.600
Where's tiny?
She didn't come?

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.600
Oh, Kate uh...

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.600
she's not with me.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.800
She finally smelled the 
pathetic on you, did she?

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.600
No. In fact, she said
she wanted to get

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.700
more serious with me.
She said that

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:31.600
you know,
she loved me

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.600
and she wanted to see herself
having a family with me

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.700
having kids with me.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:40.600
Well congratulations. That's 
what you want to hear?

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.600
- I said no, Dad.
- You what?

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.600
Yeah, I told her I didn't 
want to get married.

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:55.500
- Are you shitting me?
- Uh-uh.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.700
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.500
That's my boy.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:04.700
I always said you were
the smart one, Lando.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.600
Your mind and spirit
are strong, like mine.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.600
I tell ya. It's always the one
you fight with the most

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.800
who is the most like you.

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:20.700
Well why are we 
standing out here for?

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.700
Let's go inside, have a 
drink. Just the two of us.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.700
Man to man.
Father to son.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.800
- Alright. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.500
You're a big boy now.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:30.500
Let's go in.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.600
Take appraisal of the 
damage you've done.

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:42.600
Would anyone like
anything else?

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.700
- No, no.
- This one's out.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.600
Dad, can you check
on, Jackson?

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.700
- Yeah. The blanket.
- He's got the pillow.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.600
- This is hers?
- Yeah.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:11.700
Hey.

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.700
Okay, listen.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.600
If you get one, you might as well 
get two 'cause they're like dogs.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.600
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about, kids.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.700
If you leave one by itself,
at home, you're never gonna leave.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.600
'cause you're gonna feel so guilty about
leaving it there by itself.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.800
But if there's two, you don't feel
bad they got someone to play with.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.800
The other big thing to 
think about is, school.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.600
Do you send them to private school?
Because then you got sweater vests 

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.600
and lacrosse coming at you all day.
But if you go to a public school 

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.700
you got to worry about some 
art student, who's hyperactive 

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.800
who's all hopped up on medication,
who might try to shank the little guy,

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.600
and that's uncomfortable too.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.800
Are you having this conversation with me, because 
you're comfortable having this conversation with me?

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.700
Or are you just having this conversation, 
because you wanna go to, Fiji?

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:53.700
I wanna go to, Fiji.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.700
Because the tickets 
are already paid for

01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.700
and the hotel rooms
aren't transferable.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:01.600
But, honey, I do 
feel comfortable now

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.500
I think having this conversation
because in my heart 

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.700
I know I've found
the one person in life 

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:09.600
that I want to have
these conversations with.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:10.800
And that person's you.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.600
- I love you so much.
- Come here.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.600
So it's like, this doesn't mean
we're getting married

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.500
- or having kids right away.
- No, no, no.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.800
But we should talk about it,
because these things do happen.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.500
Not that we're planning on it. We're just talking 
about it, because these things happens.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.800
And if we do have them,
then, you know...

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.800
- there's a lot of advantages.
- Yeah. They wonderful, 

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.700
I mean, they give 
you love, unconditionally.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.800
Also, they're like little
walking tax shelters.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.800
Because you can 
write a lot of stuff off.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.500
Yeah, and not to mention all the 
yard work. You save so much money.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.600
I mean, once they become a certain age, 
we're not gonna have them on the lawnmower.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.600
- When they're seven.
- I know what your talking about, not slave labor.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.600
- No, no, no.
- We're talking about teaching them discipline.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.600
- Chores for money.
- And we're not like even planning for like our future.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.700
We would've ended up living in some
home playing Bingo in, Florida.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.800
But now we can 
live with them.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.600
- They're gonna sell us out.
- This is exciting. We never thought about it like this.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.600
Honey, I want you to feel 
comfortable to talk to me

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.700
about anything you 
want to talk about.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.600
Unless there's like, you know a 
play-off's game or something like that.

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.700
You know what I mean? We 
can find an appropriate time.

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:15.600
- I'm kidding. Kind of.
- Okay, babe.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.600
Listen, just to be clear,
this doesn't mean

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:19.600
that we're getting 
married right away 

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.600
or having kids right away.
just means that we're open

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.700
to let love grow
where it wants to grow.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.500
- Exactly.
- We're open to letting it grow.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.600
But, it doesn't mean kids.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.500
- Wow, I can't believe we did it.
- We did.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.700
I don't even know what happened,
I can't even remember the procedure

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:40.600
but here's this beautiful
thing here. You know what I mean?

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.700
I did feel
like an air traffic controller.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.600
Between the huffs,
and the signals and stuff

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.600
it just kind of all 
happened. But, god.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.500
It's awesome, baby.
You're so awesome.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.600
You were amazing.
You were like this.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.700
- Thanks, babe.
- We have a baby!

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:57.500
- How's she doing?
- Good. She's sleeping.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.600
Just wanted to let you and
our little new year's baby know 

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.800
that you're welcome to start 
bringing in family members now.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.500
- Oh that's not gonna happen.
- No, no family.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:07.800
Your families don't 
know you had a baby?

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.600
To be honest, I think they'd be shocked
to even hear that, Kate was even pregnant.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.600
Our families can be 
a little much sometimes.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.600
I like to think that we're
keeping it special for us 

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.700
rather than not
including them.

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:19.800
Happy New Year, Bay Area!

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.600
We are here live
