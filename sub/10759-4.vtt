WEBVTT

00:07.874 --> 00:08.842
Until tomorrow, then,

00:08.842 --> 00:10.744
this is Dr. Frasier Crane

00:10.744 --> 00:11.978
wishing you...

00:11.978 --> 00:12.812
Hmm?

00:12.812 --> 00:14.314
Oh, yes.

00:14.314 --> 00:17.817
Be sure to tune in later
for the final broadcast

00:17.817 --> 00:22.222
of KACL's lovable curmudgeon,
Chester Ludgate.

00:22.222 --> 00:24.591
You know, most of us
here at the station

00:24.591 --> 00:27.127
were surprised to hear
that he was retiring.

00:27.127 --> 00:29.629
I, for one,
thought he'd never leave.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.131
(sighs)

00:31.131 --> 00:32.631
So, should we
order a pizza?

00:32.631 --> 00:34.100
Hmm? Sorry?

00:34.100 --> 00:36.603
Those PSAs
you promised you'd help me with

00:36.603 --> 00:37.570
are due tomorrow.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.572
Oh, gosh, Roz,
I really am sorry.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.574
You know, it seems
Mrs. Delafield's daughter

00:41.574 --> 00:43.943
is coming here
to join us as an intern.

00:43.943 --> 00:46.646
I promised Kenny I'd show her
around and take her to dinner.

00:46.646 --> 00:48.048
Oh, so while I'm working late,

00:48.048 --> 00:49.049
eating my vending machine
dinner,

00:49.549 --> 00:51.885
you'll be out having a gourmet
meal with some cute, rich girl?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.720
Oh, you can make anything
sound unfair.

00:55.155 --> 00:56.056
Hey, Doc.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.490
Kenny.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.825
And whom have we here?

00:58.825 --> 00:59.692
Dr. Frasier Crane,

00:59.692 --> 01:02.062
I'd like you to meet
Miss Poppy Delafield.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.164
Well, got to run.

01:04.164 --> 01:05.598
Poppy.

01:05.598 --> 01:06.633
What a pleasure

01:06.633 --> 01:08.535
to meet the daughter
of our beloved

01:08.535 --> 01:09.936
station owner.

01:09.936 --> 01:11.171
Well... so,

01:11.171 --> 01:12.972
what brings you to KACL, hmm?

01:12.972 --> 01:13.840
Well...

01:13.840 --> 01:15.241
I was in Paris last month--

01:15.241 --> 01:17.744
or was it Madrid? No. Paris--
and I said to myself

01:17.744 --> 01:20.246
"that's enough gallivanting
for you, young lady.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.548
"It's time you get a job."

01:21.548 --> 01:24.184
So, I flew home
and asked my mother, Mummy,

01:24.184 --> 01:26.986
if I could nose around
and see if some job, you know,

01:26.986 --> 01:29.489
spoke to me at one
of her TV stations

01:29.489 --> 01:31.291
or radio stations
or newspapers

01:31.291 --> 01:33.893
but not her brewery--
thank you very much!

01:33.893 --> 01:36.096
So, here I am.

01:36.096 --> 01:36.996
Uh-huh.

01:36.996 --> 01:38.865
Sleeves rolled up,
ready to learn.

01:38.865 --> 01:39.666
Well, good for you.

01:40.233 --> 01:41.234
Is this where
you do your show?!

01:41.234 --> 01:42.235
Yes, it is...
Of course it is.

01:42.235 --> 01:43.736
There's your mike
right in front of me.

01:43.736 --> 01:46.606
Earth to Poppy!

01:46.606 --> 01:47.941
Oh, there's Gil.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.942
I met him earlier.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.443
Hi, Gil!

01:50.443 --> 01:52.245
Hey...
Um...

01:52.245 --> 01:53.580
Nice man.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.483
I think it's marvelous
what you do--

01:56.483 --> 01:57.984
to really help people,

01:57.984 --> 02:00.487
unlike the psychiatrists
I've been to,

02:00.487 --> 02:03.790
both of whom had some sort of--
I don't know-- narcolepsy.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.859
I sympathize.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.026
But if you can't stay awake,
don't be a psychiatrist!

02:08.026 --> 02:09.329
But to do what you do,

02:09.829 --> 02:12.332
to face that microphone
day after day

02:12.332 --> 02:14.834
and know that
for the next three hours

02:14.834 --> 02:18.338
you're going to have
to talk and talk and talk...

02:18.338 --> 02:20.340
I could not do it!

02:20.340 --> 02:21.841
I would freeze!

02:21.841 --> 02:23.343
Literally freeze!

02:23.343 --> 02:24.844
(phone ringing)
I mean...

02:24.844 --> 02:25.845
Excuse me.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.147
Hello?

02:27.147 --> 02:27.914
Yes.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.449
Yes, Dad.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.451
All right, all right,
calm down, calm down.

02:31.451 --> 02:32.452
Was there much blood?

02:32.452 --> 02:33.453
Oh, my gosh!

02:33.453 --> 02:35.188
All right, Dad,
I'll be there

02:35.188 --> 02:36.990
as soon as I can.
Hang on a second.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.992
I'm terribly sorry. There's a
small emergency at home.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.493
I'm going to have
to pass on dinner.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.761
May I take a rain check?

02:41.761 --> 02:43.396
Oh, and we were having
such a nice chat.

02:43.396 --> 02:44.230
Yes, well, I...

02:44.764 --> 02:46.766
Oh, this is Roz Doyle,
my producer.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.235
You know, Roz, I'll gladly
do those promos

02:49.235 --> 02:51.704
if you would be so kind
as to take Poppy to dinner

02:51.704 --> 02:52.672
and answer her questions.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.674
Sure! If you
don't get bored

02:54.674 --> 02:56.176
listening to me
drone on about radio.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.946
Oh, I don't think
there's much chance of that.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.086
Eddie, come on, get in here.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.390
What the hell's happening?

03:10.390 --> 03:11.791
Well...

03:11.791 --> 03:13.626
remember last week
when Eddie killed his first rat

03:13.626 --> 03:15.161
how proud I was?
I told you that story, right?

03:15.161 --> 03:16.563
Yes, Dad,
you told us.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.432
If you'd had a guitar,
you'd have written a ballad.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.201
Well, we were just

03:21.201 --> 03:23.036
down in the basement,
and I saw another rat.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.037
I said, "Go get him, boy."

03:24.037 --> 03:26.539
So, just as he picked him up,
had him in his teeth,

03:26.539 --> 03:27.540
shaking the life out of him,

03:27.540 --> 03:29.475
I hear this little bell
tinkling.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.877
And I thought,
"Well, that's funny.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.246
Rats don't wear bells."

03:33.246 --> 03:35.048
Oh, my God, little Robbie
Greenberg's missing hamster.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.616
Yes, I read that flyer.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.484
He was offering
a ten-dollar reward.

03:38.484 --> 03:41.354
Well, the most we can claim
at this point is about $6.50.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.856
Oh, my! You know what?

03:43.856 --> 03:46.226
Dad, this is actually
your fault, you know.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.094
If you hadn't encouraged him
after he killed his first rat,

03:48.094 --> 03:50.063
he wouldn't have moved on
to murdering hamsters.

03:50.063 --> 03:50.997
Well, what are you
talking about?

03:51.497 --> 03:52.498
We don't know
it was Eddie who killed him.

03:52.498 --> 03:53.499
He might have
had a heart attack

03:53.499 --> 03:55.401
or-or some kind
of seizure

03:55.401 --> 03:57.303
when he bounced off
the boiler.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.305
(doorbells rings)
(groans)

04:00.106 --> 04:01.407
Niles.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.443
Prepare to whoop
like a sweepstakes winner.

04:03.443 --> 04:04.444
Cancel our dinner.

04:04.444 --> 04:06.446
I've scored us two seats,
front row,

04:06.446 --> 04:07.847
for the event of the season.

04:07.847 --> 04:09.048
You mean...?
Yes! But...

04:09.048 --> 04:10.783
I know.
Niles!

04:10.783 --> 04:12.185
I love it
when they do it this way.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.988
I can pretend
it's a Seahawks game.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.790
My God! No, Dad!

04:17.790 --> 04:20.226
It's for
the Cecilia Bartoli concert.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.226
My God, it's been sold out
for months!

04:21.226 --> 04:23.229
How on earth did you ever score
these tickets?

04:23.229 --> 04:24.697
I simply phoned
the box office

04:24.697 --> 04:26.065
and said, "This
is Niles Crane,

04:26.065 --> 04:28.735
the new arts critic
for The Monocle."

04:28.735 --> 04:29.602
(Frasier gasping)

04:30.103 --> 04:31.037
DAPHNE:
The Monocle?

04:31.037 --> 04:33.439
Isn't that that magazine
they hand out to rich people

04:33.439 --> 04:35.275
in all the snootiest
apartment buildings?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.110
And the snootiest
hotels.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.044
How did this happen, Niles?

04:38.044 --> 04:40.613
I was at a party thrown
by the publisher,

04:40.613 --> 04:41.914
Olga Swarbreck.
Mm-hmm, yes.

04:41.914 --> 04:43.216
The pretentious fop

04:43.216 --> 04:45.218
who had the job before me
was there, too,

04:45.218 --> 04:48.154
spouting sheer drivel
about Leonard Bernstein.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.723
Being polite,
I kept my tongue sheathed,

04:50.723 --> 04:53.693
until he referred to Bernstein's
conducting as "overrated."

04:53.693 --> 04:54.661
I assume you pounced!

04:54.661 --> 04:56.663
Like a ninja!

05:00.133 --> 05:02.602
By the time I'd finished
with him, Olga could see

05:02.602 --> 05:05.104
I was a far better critic
than that arrogant poseur.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.472
She fired him right there?

05:06.472 --> 05:07.840
Well, he was leaving anyway

05:07.840 --> 05:09.142
for his junior year abroad.

05:10.443 --> 05:11.411
Well, I suppose

05:11.411 --> 05:12.912
that congratulations
are in order.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.280
You know,
who would have thought,

05:14.280 --> 05:16.649
my little brother,
a professional music critic.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.518
Oh, oh, and
not just music.

05:18.518 --> 05:21.287
I can review anything I want:
Theater, dance, art exhibits.

05:21.287 --> 05:23.089
You don't say?
Yes. From now on

05:23.089 --> 05:24.457
wherever we go,
I'll be armed

05:24.457 --> 05:25.958
with my trusty pad
and pen light.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.460
Wherever we go.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.461
What fun!

05:28.961 --> 05:29.962
(chuckling):
Yes.

05:30.463 --> 05:31.964
I have to take a damp cloth
to these opera glasses--

05:31.964 --> 05:34.467
although I don't know
what we use them for

05:34.467 --> 05:35.468
sitting in the front row.

05:35.968 --> 05:39.439
Unless it's to scan the faces
of the jealous people behind us.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.909
So... are
you, uh, sure

05:42.909 --> 05:45.411
you're okay with Niles
getting this critic job?

05:45.411 --> 05:47.280
Why wouldn't I be, Dad?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.581
Oh, come on, I know
what it's like with you two

05:48.581 --> 05:51.084
when one of you gets something
that the other one doesn't have.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.352
It's just like
when you were kids.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.586
Niles had a telescope,

05:53.586 --> 05:55.121
you had to have
a telescope.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.056
You got that
funny-looking guitar,

05:57.056 --> 05:58.925
Niles had...
Dad, it was called a lute.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.727
Yeah, oh, yeah. Okay.

06:00.727 --> 06:04.097
Dad, believe me, I do not envy
Niles his critic's job.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.432
But as kids, we would
aggravate the situation

06:06.432 --> 06:08.301
by flaunting our toys
in each other's faces.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.737
We're much more mature
than that now. All right?

06:10.737 --> 06:12.171
Niles, you know what?

06:12.171 --> 06:13.172
It's about time we got going.

06:13.172 --> 06:14.674
We don't want to be late
for the curtain.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.175
Don't be silly.
I'm press now.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.177
They'll hold it.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.122
POPPY:
So, that's how it ends.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.124
B-minus average,
ten extra pounds

06:31.124 --> 06:32.992
and still no boyfriend!

06:32.992 --> 06:35.895
I see Poppy's having
a little party.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.864
That is not a party.

06:37.864 --> 06:40.400
That's a hostage situation.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.902
Thank God
today is her last day.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.903
You know, this morning

06:43.903 --> 06:45.905
she cornered me
by the coffee machine

06:45.905 --> 06:47.407
and told me
her whole life story.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.909
I just wanted
to grab her by the throat

06:49.909 --> 06:51.377
and say, "What am I,
your biographer?

06:51.911 --> 06:52.712
Shut up!"

06:52.712 --> 06:54.280
GIL:
Dear God!

06:54.280 --> 06:55.548
I thought I'd never break free.

06:55.548 --> 06:59.485
I feel like a mongoose
at the mercy of a chatty cobra.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.524
Oh! Hello, all.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.026
I... oh, I see you
already have the Times.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.961
I'm quoted there today.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.730
In the Times?

07:10.730 --> 07:12.899
Yes. Here, it's in this ad
for Shaw's Saint Joan.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.300
"Incandescent.

07:14.300 --> 07:15.802
Niles Crane, The Monocle."

07:15.802 --> 07:17.003
ROZ:
Wow!

07:17.003 --> 07:18.371
Excuse me while I go tell

07:18.371 --> 07:20.373
all my friends I know you.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.375
(chuckling)

07:22.375 --> 07:23.376
Oh...

07:23.376 --> 07:24.377
(yawning)

07:24.377 --> 07:25.378
Forgive me.

07:25.378 --> 07:26.379
Hmm.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.314
Olga and I
were up till all hours

07:28.314 --> 07:29.715
at a party for
the Royal Shakespeare Company.

07:31.384 --> 07:35.521
I'm rubbing some pretty
impressive shoulders these days.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.160
And to think, it's all
because I have a small column.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.096
That would certainly be
the Freudian interpretation.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.069
If I were to review
that attitude,

07:50.069 --> 07:52.839
I'd say it was a chilling
portrait of malice and envy.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.640
Oh, Niles,
I'm not the least bit envious

07:54.640 --> 07:57.109
that you get to spout off
in that glorified cat box liner.

07:57.109 --> 08:01.514
You just can't stand it that my
opinion means more than yours--

08:01.514 --> 08:03.316
that the arts community
looks to me

08:03.316 --> 08:06.586
for my insight, my approval,
my thumbs up.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.388
I think we both know
what your thumb's up these days.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.291
That's a good one, Frasier.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.794
Perhaps you should use it
in your column.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.662
Oh, that's right,
you don't have one!

08:20.032 --> 08:23.069
That smug jackass!

08:23.069 --> 08:25.571
Frasier, you have
a radio show.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.073
If you wanted to say what
you thought of a play,

08:27.073 --> 08:28.074
who's stopping you?

08:28.074 --> 08:31.077
It's not the same thing
as being a real critic, Roz.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.578
You don't get free tickets.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.081
You don't get quoted.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.082
Forget hobnobbing.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.085
My God,
this competition

08:39.085 --> 08:41.587
between you and your
brother is sick.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.054
Your obsessive one-upmanship.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.057
You're both going to end up

08:45.057 --> 08:47.360
bitter, old cranks
like Chester Ludgate.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.161
You do raise a good point,
Roz. Thank you.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.162
Chester's time slot
is free.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.598
I could do
my own arts show.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.066
Yes. Kenny, Kenny.

08:54.066 --> 08:57.069
Listen, Roz just had
the most wonderful idea.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.371
Yeah, Doc?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.673
What do you say
about yours truly

09:00.673 --> 09:02.708
hosting a...
a bouncy little show

09:02.708 --> 09:04.610
about the arts in Seattle?

09:04.610 --> 09:06.979
Culture...

09:07.513 --> 09:09.015
Wow.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.017
Oh, it-it's a great idea.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.986
Let me chew on that, and I'll,
uh, I'll get back to you.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.454
Great! You see, Roz?

09:15.454 --> 09:16.455
He loved your idea.

09:16.455 --> 09:17.456
That was not
my idea.

09:17.456 --> 09:18.457
It was, too, your idea.

09:18.457 --> 09:19.725
It was not...
Doc?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.027
I feel kind of bad
about what I just did.

09:21.527 --> 09:22.995
I, uh, I let you think
that there was a chance

09:22.995 --> 09:24.530
that I might let you
do this culture show

09:24.530 --> 09:28.501
and, uh, there's not.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.970
No chance at all?

09:30.970 --> 09:32.438
No.

09:32.438 --> 09:33.439
Oh.

09:33.439 --> 09:34.407
I mean,

09:34.407 --> 09:35.841
come on, Doc.

09:35.841 --> 09:36.876
You, culture, opera.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.377
Who's listening?

09:38.377 --> 09:39.345
(chuckling)

09:39.345 --> 09:40.346
Not me!

09:44.784 --> 09:46.252
Damn! I think

09:46.252 --> 09:47.687
my show's a good idea.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.655
Kenny's the station
manager, and he doesn't.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.657
Yes, you know, frankly,
I didn't like his attitude.

09:51.657 --> 09:54.660
He acts like he owns
the station, but he doesn't.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.028
Someone else does.

09:56.028 --> 09:56.796
Poppy!

09:56.796 --> 09:57.730
The next best thing.

09:57.730 --> 09:58.631
Her mother!

09:58.631 --> 09:59.999
No. Poppy!
Oh, right.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.467
Hi, Frasier!

10:01.467 --> 10:02.969
Hello, Poppy.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.870
Gosh, would you care to join me?

10:04.870 --> 10:06.706
Oh, I can't.
Mummy's taking me shopping.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.174
She spoils me
something horrible.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.610
I guess
it's an only-child thing.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.979
Anything I want,
I just have to ask.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.347
Anything you want?

10:14.347 --> 10:15.848
Oh, well,
isn't that interesting.

10:15.848 --> 10:18.351
You know, Poppy, perhaps, um,
we could, uh,

10:18.351 --> 10:20.820
join each other for lunch
after your shopping spree.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.254
I'd love it!

10:22.254 --> 10:23.723
Would you really?
It seems a shame

10:23.723 --> 10:25.157
you leaving the station

10:25.157 --> 10:27.126
and us never having really
gotten to know one another.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.628
Oh, it hasn't been easy--

10:28.628 --> 10:31.631
I mean, with your having those
dental appointments every day.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.898
Oh, yes.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.935
Well, you know,
let me walk you out.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.203
I should get
the name of your dentist.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.704
I can't find one I like.

10:38.704 --> 10:40.706
They're always giving me
Novocain when I don't need it

10:40.706 --> 10:42.708
and then it's hours
before I can talk again.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.211
Oh, yes, well...
I could give you his number

10:45.211 --> 10:48.214
although I'm not sure
he'd be any different.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.588
(symphonic music ending)

10:55.588 --> 10:58.424
Divine Beethoven.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.426
It's extraordinary, isn't it?

11:00.426 --> 11:02.194
Ah, yes.

11:02.194 --> 11:04.430
And you know what makes it
even more amazing?

11:04.430 --> 11:05.865
What?

11:06.766 --> 11:09.235
He was deaf!

11:14.407 --> 11:18.077
Daphne, uh...
more pate, please.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.721
Poppy, I-I can't tell
you how wonderful it is

11:28.721 --> 11:33.092
to meet someone who shares
my passion for the arts.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.628
It's a rare thing to find
in Seattle,

11:35.628 --> 11:36.595
believe me.
Is it?

11:36.595 --> 11:38.531
Oh, yes, sadly.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.966
If only more people
were better informed

11:40.966 --> 11:44.036
about our city's
rich cultural treasures.

11:44.036 --> 11:50.509
Ah... but what can we,
as mere radio folk, do?

11:50.509 --> 11:51.911
Well...

11:55.281 --> 11:58.784
What about...
a radio show

11:58.784 --> 12:01.287
all about the arts
in Seattle?

12:01.287 --> 12:04.757
Oh, my God, Poppy,
that's a wonderful idea!

12:04.757 --> 12:06.258
How do you do it?

12:06.258 --> 12:08.594
You just pull these things
out of the air.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.129
Oh, heavens.

12:10.129 --> 12:13.432
Of course, we'll have to find
ourselves a proper host.

12:13.432 --> 12:14.800
But who?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.168
Well, someone very smart...

12:16.168 --> 12:18.170
Oh, indeed.
And cultured...

12:18.170 --> 12:20.506
Bien sur.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.575
And with a lovely
speaking voice.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.311
Oh, I don't think
we need to look too far.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.746
Here you go.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.247
It's very rich

12:28.247 --> 12:30.649
so don't spread it on too thick.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.219
Frasier,

12:33.219 --> 12:36.155
I'm so glad
you're on board with this.

12:36.155 --> 12:39.558
You know, my only concern is,
will Kenny go for it?

12:39.558 --> 12:41.961
You see,
he's a bit of a philistine.

12:41.961 --> 12:43.596
It might be better

12:43.596 --> 12:45.898
if the suggestion came
not actually from us

12:45.898 --> 12:49.368
but from... someone else.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.604
Who?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.439
Well, someone with...

12:53.939 --> 12:57.710
more authority, power...
influence.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.448
Someone older.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.618
A woman, perhaps.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.521
Your mother.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.022
He means your mother.

13:10.022 --> 13:11.457
Oh...

13:14.126 --> 13:16.061
Great idea!
I'll call her.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.563
Oh, here, here, use mine.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.833
(laughing):
Oh... thank you.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.636
Hello, Mummy?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.037
I'm with Frasier Crane,

13:25.037 --> 13:29.842
and we think there should be
an arts show on KACL.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.612
But I really like this idea.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.148
So you'll call Kenny

13:36.148 --> 13:38.651
and tell him
you want this, okay?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.985
Love you, too.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.320
Okay, bye.

13:42.755 --> 13:44.190
And the first show
should be...?

13:44.190 --> 13:45.691
Why don't we
start tomorrow?

13:45.691 --> 13:48.194
But we'll need something
to review. (gasps)

13:48.194 --> 13:50.696
That revival of A Streetcar
Named Desire opens tonight.

13:50.696 --> 13:52.198
Splendid! Let's
go together.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.067
All right... I'll see
you at the theater.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.468
(both laughing)

13:56.468 --> 13:57.903
Oh, Poppy...

13:57.903 --> 13:59.872
(baby talk):
Hewwo, widdle Eddie!

13:59.872 --> 14:02.741
Did you have
a good walk?!

14:04.543 --> 14:06.679
Actually, we've just been
to the vet's.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.480
I had the cutest little
dog when I was young

14:08.981 --> 14:09.982
named Mr. Oops.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.984
Every time we took him
to the vet, he...

14:15.287 --> 14:16.822
You took Eddie
to the vet?

14:16.822 --> 14:18.190
Is he sick?
MARTIN: No.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.025
Turns out
the building security camera

14:20.025 --> 14:23.863
caught Eddie taking out
Robbie Greenberg's hamster.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.432
So... this
Greenberg kid's

14:26.432 --> 14:29.201
trying to make Eddie out
to be some kind of pit bull.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.703
He's organizing some petition

14:30.703 --> 14:32.605
to get him banned
from the building.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.039
Oh, Dad, that's terrible.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.007
Yeah, it is.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.508
So, uh, I don't know.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.777
I just wanted
everybody to see

14:38.777 --> 14:42.481
what a nice, calm,
friendly dog Eddie was.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.916
So why'd you take him
to the vet?

14:43.916 --> 14:45.684
Tranquilizers.

14:45.684 --> 14:48.320
They don't even
work anyway.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.089
I gave Eddie one of those
pills on the ride home.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.090
They didn't do
a thing to him.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.591
I don't know.

14:52.591 --> 14:53.592
I think maybe he
needs something else.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.594
Uh, Mr. Crane...

14:59.765 --> 15:01.533
(doorbell rings)
Looks like all he needs

15:01.533 --> 15:04.536
is a lava lamp
and some sitar music.

15:07.039 --> 15:08.540
Niles!

15:08.540 --> 15:11.043
Well, uh, I'm glad to see
you're in a better mood.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.045
I-I was... hoping you'd lend me

15:13.045 --> 15:14.546
your Tennessee
Williams biography.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.448
I have to review that revival
of Streetcar tonight,

15:16.448 --> 15:18.450
and I wanted to throw in
some background stuff.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.785
Well,
I'm sorry, Niles.

15:19.785 --> 15:21.620
You know, normally I would,
except that I'm going

15:21.620 --> 15:23.622
to be needing it myself
for my own review.

15:23.622 --> 15:24.924
Oh. Well, in that
case, I'll...

15:24.924 --> 15:27.726
Wha...?

15:27.726 --> 15:29.528
What?

15:29.528 --> 15:31.330
Oh, that's right--
you wouldn't have heard.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.831
You see, starting tomorrow,

15:32.831 --> 15:34.700
I'll be doing my own
little arts show on KACL,

15:34.700 --> 15:37.036
twice weekly.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.871
You envious reptile.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.506
Pate?

15:40.506 --> 15:42.341
I achieve one thing,
one tiny distinction

15:42.341 --> 15:43.876
you don't have,
and what do you do?

15:43.876 --> 15:45.878
You run whining to Kenny
for extra air time.

15:45.878 --> 15:46.812
I did no such thing.

15:46.812 --> 15:48.781
No. He went to that
Poppy woman instead.

15:48.781 --> 15:49.682
Poppy?

15:49.682 --> 15:51.083
Is this a panel discussion?

15:51.083 --> 15:52.084
You loathe Poppy.
I do not.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.019
I think she's delightful.
Isn't she?

15:54.019 --> 15:56.755
She's an idiot.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.090
You conniving copycat.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.059
You have to have
whatever I have.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.593
I do not have
what you have.

16:01.593 --> 16:03.529
My audience is twice
as large as yours is.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.564
Oh, well, at least
my audience can read.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.466
How dare you
review my audience!

16:07.466 --> 16:08.834
NILES: I'll review
whatever I want!

16:08.834 --> 16:11.103
I've never seen him
like this--

16:11.103 --> 16:12.871
eyes bulging,
tongue lolling out...

16:12.871 --> 16:14.173
Oh, he always
gets that way

16:14.173 --> 16:16.275
when he fights with Niles.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.013
Good morning, Roz.
Oh, hi.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.548
(chuckling)

16:22.548 --> 16:23.549
You ready for our debut?

16:23.549 --> 16:26.051
Listen, I'm thinking
of calling the show

16:26.051 --> 16:27.920
"Frasier Crane's Aisle Say"

16:27.920 --> 16:31.123
but with the "I'll"
spelled like a theater "aisle."

16:31.123 --> 16:33.025
That should work real well
on radio.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.526
You better watch
out for Kenny.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.028
I hear he's
pretty mad at you

16:36.028 --> 16:37.029
for going over his head.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.530
Oh, he can't be mad at me.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.032
The whole thing
was Poppy's idea.

16:40.032 --> 16:42.368
Oh. Here she is now,
come to wish me luck.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.236
(chuckling)

16:44.236 --> 16:46.705
Poppy. I was afraid
I wouldn't get here on time.

16:46.705 --> 16:47.706
Oh, here, here.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.708
We've got a few minutes
before the show starts.

16:49.708 --> 16:50.642
Take a seat.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.644
Catch your breath.

16:52.644 --> 16:53.545
Oh, gosh,

16:53.545 --> 16:54.913
I'm really glad you made it.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.682
It wouldn't be
a proper debut without you.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.484
Wow. All these buttons.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.485
How do you do it?

16:59.485 --> 17:01.487
Oh, it's not that
complicated, really.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.988
You know, I turn on
the mike here,

17:02.988 --> 17:03.989
these are my call buttons

17:03.989 --> 17:06.492
and, uh... oh,
I push this button here

17:06.492 --> 17:07.459
if I want to cough.

17:07.459 --> 17:10.396
How does it make you cough?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.800
You know, Poppy,
I hate to rush you,

17:14.800 --> 17:17.803
but we've just got a couple
of minutes before the show, so...

17:17.803 --> 17:19.805
Whoo! I'd better
get a move on.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.775
(laughing)

17:23.308 --> 17:25.077
Poppy, what are you doing?

17:25.077 --> 17:26.678
Getting ready for my show.

17:26.678 --> 17:29.114
One minute.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.116
Your show?

17:31.116 --> 17:32.618
Well, okay, our show.

17:32.618 --> 17:36.088
After all, it was your idea
for me to do it.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.890
Everyone!

17:37.890 --> 17:40.059
Everyone, come
in here, please.

17:41.427 --> 17:42.861
Before I begin my new show,

17:42.861 --> 17:45.230
I just want to
say a few words.

17:45.230 --> 17:49.334
Yesterday,
I was ready to leave KACL

17:49.334 --> 17:52.905
to run away, as I have from
so many other challenges.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.207
It was the support of one man--

17:55.207 --> 17:57.076
Frasier Crane--

17:57.076 --> 17:59.445
that helped me
overcome the shyness

17:59.445 --> 18:01.947
many of you
may have observed in me

18:01.947 --> 18:05.951
and to follow my dreams.

18:05.951 --> 18:09.321
Oh, God... I want to cry.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.491
We all do.

18:12.491 --> 18:13.792
ROZ:
Ten seconds!

18:13.792 --> 18:15.661
(Poppy yells)

18:17.362 --> 18:19.231
How could you
do this to us?

18:19.231 --> 18:21.300
I had no idea she
intended to stay.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.702
That's not
what her mother told me.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.905
And I thought I'd seen
some cruel pranks in the army.

18:29.074 --> 18:30.909
I assure you, she is
way out of her depth here.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.945
Any moment she'll realize
she's in over head,

18:32.945 --> 18:35.247
and she'll be begging me
to take over for her.

18:35.247 --> 18:37.549
"A Streetcar Named Desire

18:37.549 --> 18:40.385
"is a very powerful
Broadway play.

18:40.385 --> 18:43.622
"It was made into a movie
starring Marlon Brando.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.023
"This gave the play

18:45.023 --> 18:47.025
"a very personal
relevance for me

18:47.025 --> 18:48.994
"as I once sat
next to Mr. Brando

18:49.495 --> 18:51.997
"on the Concorde,
and we had a very lovely chat

18:51.997 --> 18:55.267
until a sudden cramp
forced him to change seats."

18:57.402 --> 18:59.738
"Streetcar...

18:59.738 --> 19:03.242
"tells the tragic
tale of Blanche DuBois

19:03.242 --> 19:06.745
(with Southern accent):
"who's a very genteel

19:06.745 --> 19:10.516
"very proper
Southern lady...

19:10.516 --> 19:13.218
(deep voice):
or is she?"

19:30.636 --> 19:33.639
Go ahead, Niles.
I know you were listening.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.641
Well...

19:35.641 --> 19:38.610
I wish you'd lent her your
Tennessee Williams biography.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.579
She wouldn't have kept
forgetting his name

19:40.579 --> 19:42.915
and calling him Indiana Jones.

19:47.052 --> 19:51.456
If it's any consolation,
I got fired from The Monocle.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.826
Oh, Niles, I'm sorry.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.094
Mm.

19:56.094 --> 19:57.896
I panned a wretched musical

19:57.896 --> 20:02.401
not realizing the lead was
the person who does Olga's hair.

20:02.401 --> 20:05.204
She fired you
just to placate her hairdresser?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.905
Electrolysist.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.774
And if you'd ever

20:08.774 --> 20:11.710
seen her in a sundress,
you'd forgive her as I have.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.680
Oh, I am sorry, Niles.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.215
Gosh, it's such
a shame, really.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.217
You know, I know how much
you loved that job

20:18.217 --> 20:20.586
and to lose it in such
an unceremonious fashion.

20:21.486 --> 20:23.488
Well, you know...

20:23.488 --> 20:25.958
I was thinking
of quitting that job anyway.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.893
Oh?
Mm-hmm.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.295
I felt I was
spreading myself too thin.

20:30.295 --> 20:32.564
Getting distracted
from my real work.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.865
I had the exact same thought.

20:33.865 --> 20:35.867
Even as I was preparing my show,
I thought,

20:35.867 --> 20:37.636
"Am I being fair
to my regular listeners?"

20:37.636 --> 20:38.737
They do depend on you.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.572
As do your patients.
Thank you.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.573
Gosh, you know,
is it any wonder

20:41.573 --> 20:43.976
we find ourselves
ex-critics?

20:43.976 --> 20:46.311
We were meant
to lose those jobs.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.779
It's as if
the Gods of psychiatry,

20:47.779 --> 20:48.780
jealous of our dalliance,

20:48.780 --> 20:51.149
have quietly stepped in
and put things right.

20:51.149 --> 20:52.484
Well put.

20:52.484 --> 20:53.919
Oh, thank you, thank you.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.954
You know, Niles,
if you're feeling a bit hungry,

20:55.954 --> 20:57.322
we could catch an early dinner
and then...

20:57.322 --> 21:00.125
Oh, oh, and then catch
the new Stoppard play. Splendid!

21:00.125 --> 21:01.560
You know,
it's just a shame

21:01.560 --> 21:04.563
my listeners never got to hear
my review of Streetcar.

21:04.563 --> 21:06.465
Oh, insightful,
was it? Groundbreaking.

21:06.465 --> 21:07.699
Mm, as was mine.

21:07.699 --> 21:09.034
Yes, well, it takes
a psychiatrist

21:09.034 --> 21:09.968
to interpret that play.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.704
Mm-hmm. Indeed.
All right, you go first.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.106
All right.
Go.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.607
"A descent into madness
proves well worth the trip

21:15.607 --> 21:18.110
in this incandescent revival
of A Streetcar Named Desire."

21:18.110 --> 21:19.111
Just a moment, Niles.
Incandescent--

21:19.111 --> 21:20.612
isn't that the same tired word

21:20.612 --> 21:22.114
you used
for that Saint Joan review?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.115
