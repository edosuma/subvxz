WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:04.636
Granger:<i> Let us know</i>
<i> when you have a positive id</i>

00:04.638 --> 00:06.071
<i> On the white ghost.</i>

00:06.073 --> 00:07.673
Yeah, I see him.
Take the shot, agent blye.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.508
(men shouting)

00:09.510 --> 00:11.510
We have a situation.
Blye's missing.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.545
Hetty:
They were engaged ten years ago.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.581
And I sent kensi

00:15.583 --> 00:17.383
To be his executioner.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.517
And your wife?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.085
She was killed
in a drone strike.

00:20.087 --> 00:21.687
I just want to find
my partner and go home.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.123
Give me a name!

00:26.060 --> 00:27.426
I'm really glad you're alive.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.569
(gunshots)

00:40.708 --> 00:42.474
(tires screech)

00:50.618 --> 00:53.652
You told me you were in trouble.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.156
Looks to me like you
brought it with you.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.725
¶ ¶

01:22.650 --> 01:23.315
I saw that.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.650
Saw what?

01:24.652 --> 01:25.651
You looked at what
I was writing.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.252
Did not.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.821
How you know what I'm writing
isn't classified?

01:28.823 --> 01:30.756
Since when is your grocery list
classified, huh?

01:30.758 --> 01:32.324
Don't try to guess, g.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.392
Deeks:
Morning!

01:33.394 --> 01:35.327
Morning.
Morning.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.795
Go ahead.
(whispering)

01:36.797 --> 01:38.363
Now is the time.
Please.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.400
(stammers) guess what.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.602
According to sam,
I'm not allowed to.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.087
Just tell them.
No, no.
You can have the honors.

01:45.088 --> 01:46.571
Go for it.
Okay, fine, we're
moving in together.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.373
In fact, I'm moving
in with deeks.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.776
This is true. What she's saying
is her words that are truth.

01:51.712 --> 01:52.544
That's great.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.645
"great."

01:53.647 --> 01:55.414
Seriously, that's
all you have to say?

01:55.416 --> 01:56.815
"that's great"?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.350
You, you don't have
anything to say?

01:58.352 --> 02:00.385
I thought you already
were living together.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.554
Eric:
You guys, congratulations!

02:02.556 --> 02:04.323
Oh, my gosh, this is so great.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.591
When's the big occasion?

02:05.593 --> 02:06.859
Well, not that big occasion.
You know,

02:06.861 --> 02:08.193
Could be a little premature.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.595
Not that I don't believe in you.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.662
It's tonight. It's tonight.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.397
And I'm very excited.
Yep.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.166
That's so cool.
Congrats, guys.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.234
Kensi: Thank you.
Your enthusiasm

02:15.236 --> 02:17.736
Means a lot to me.
Us.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.171
Eric: Aw, yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)

02:19.173 --> 02:20.439
Are you guys
gonna get a puppy?

02:20.441 --> 02:21.673
A little sibling for monty.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.742
They'd be so cute.
Oh. No.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.744
We weren't gonna get a puppy.
Baby steps.

02:25.746 --> 02:26.778
We're just gonna
move in together.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.247
No big deal.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.648
Puppies are a big deal.
(clears throat)

02:29.650 --> 02:32.251
Well, uh, the final destination
is, uh, hetty's office.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.519
That's a...

02:33.521 --> 02:34.553
Puppy-free zone.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.756
Hetty:
<i> Don't lose this,</i>

02:37.758 --> 02:39.458
Mr. Deeks.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.760
These, uh, the keys
to the shelby cobra?

02:41.762 --> 02:43.829
You wish.
You and kensi

02:43.831 --> 02:45.931
Are now on protection detail.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.634
(phones chime)
that's eric sending you

02:48.636 --> 02:50.802
The address
to one of my residences.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.538
Great. Who are we protecting?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.506
Time's wasting. Go.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.377
You'll be relieving
a very tired ncis agent

02:58.379 --> 02:59.678
Already on duty.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.580
Cryptic.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.714
Okay.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.651
Ms. Jones.
Yes. Late last night,

03:05.653 --> 03:08.453
Cameras caught this car fleeing
a downtown shootout.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.955
Sam: That looks like
a home security system.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.757
And a good one.
Oh, it is.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.625
I bought that building

03:13.627 --> 03:14.943
Earlier this year.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.260
Did you say
you bought the building?

03:16.263 --> 03:17.796
A modest building,

03:17.798 --> 03:18.797
Mr. Hanna.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.532
Henrietta lange, slumlord.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.868
One of my contacts
was on his way

03:22.870 --> 03:26.638
To see me last night,
but the man in that car

03:26.640 --> 03:27.673
Tried to kill him.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.308
The driver aborted the attack

03:29.310 --> 03:33.212
After an unidentified shooter
shot out the windshield.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.782
My contact was
to meet a man

03:36.784 --> 03:38.650
Named sy riggs.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.253
When mr. Riggs didn't show up,

03:41.255 --> 03:43.889
My contact called me, worried,

03:43.891 --> 03:46.425
And I told him to come meet me.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.626
Nell:
Sy riggs works out

03:47.628 --> 03:49.761
Of an la field office
for a division

03:49.763 --> 03:51.763
Of immigration
customs enforcement.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.599
He was recently sent
to afghanistan

03:53.601 --> 03:55.634
To catalogue antiquities sites.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.302
According to intel
I've received,

03:57.304 --> 03:59.838
Mr. Riggs is very motivated

03:59.840 --> 04:03.742
To sell this information
to the highest bidder.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.977
Homeland security
believes that

04:04.979 --> 04:07.279
Should terror groups get
their hands on this list

04:07.281 --> 04:09.581
Of sites,
they could potentially

04:09.583 --> 04:11.850
Loot the artifacts and then
sell them on the black market

04:11.852 --> 04:13.285
To raise funds for operations.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.386
Callen:
Well, digging this stuff up

04:14.388 --> 04:16.388
Would be better
than blowing it up,

04:16.390 --> 04:18.523
But either way
it would be a huge loss

04:18.525 --> 04:19.858
To history and culture.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.026
I'll say.
Sam:
Where's riggs now?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.728
We don't know.
He flew into la

04:22.730 --> 04:24.863
Late last week
on a flight from kabul,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.398
Hasn't been seen since.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.866
Cell phone?
Turned off.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.001
What about the shooter's car?
Registered

04:29.003 --> 04:31.336
To a mabel perkins
of garden grove,

04:31.338 --> 04:33.388
82 years old.

04:33.389 --> 04:35.439
Kaleidoscope tracked the car
to a nearby warehouse.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.608
Ms. Jones,

04:36.610 --> 04:38.644
You and mr. Beale
need to figure out

04:38.646 --> 04:41.380
Which antiquities dealers
would be interested

04:41.382 --> 04:42.748
In buying this list.

04:42.750 --> 04:43.849
Will do.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.952
Thank you.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.620
And you're still here.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.788
Callen:
You still haven't told us

04:49.790 --> 04:50.956
Who your contact is.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.025
Right.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.034
Does she know?

05:03.804 --> 05:07.806
No, but she's about to find out.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.944
Wow.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.982
Hetty has a knack
for old buildings, evidently.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.618
I got to be honest,
not what I had in mind.

05:24.058 --> 05:26.591
Kensi: Four apartments
per floor, three stories.

05:26.593 --> 05:28.060
Looks pretty empty to me.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.595
Smells empty. Hetty's
probably its sole occupant.

05:30.597 --> 05:31.863
She's probably
thinking of flipping it.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.065
You should help her.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.433
Go into business with hetty?

05:34.435 --> 05:35.567
(chuckles) are you serious?

05:35.569 --> 05:36.968
You're the flipping expert.
Why not?

05:36.970 --> 05:38.704
First thing I'd do is
lose these light fixtures,

05:38.706 --> 05:40.505
Adios to this wallpaper,
cover that conduit,

05:40.507 --> 05:41.873
Put in some crown molding.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.041
See this linoleum floor?

05:43.043 --> 05:45.844
That's gone,
because it's not 1971.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.579
Just spitballing here.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.747
Man:
Who is it?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.415
Hetty sent us.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.984
You guys took your time.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.420
Come in.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.923
Wow.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.391
Yeah. Did not see this coming.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.128
I'm beat.
Been here all night.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.063
I've been there.
Where's our protectee?

06:05.065 --> 06:06.465
Bedroom.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.899
Not much of a talker.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.968
All right, we'll take it
from here. Go get some sleep.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.636
Anything for ms. Lange.

06:11.638 --> 06:12.637
Thanks.

06:12.639 --> 06:13.638
(door shuts)

06:13.640 --> 06:16.007
What do you think?

06:16.009 --> 06:18.477
(whistles, chuckles)

06:19.446 --> 06:20.512
Jack:
Hello, kensi.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.715
Deeks.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.950
Jack?

06:53.714 --> 06:54.713
Shooter's car

06:54.715 --> 06:56.581
Should be in there.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.717
Mabel perkins, 82 years old.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.720
The name mabel doesn't exactly
sound threatening to me.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.522
Neither does
the name henrietta.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.590
You have a point.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.692
Why does hetty always do that?

07:07.694 --> 07:09.761
You mean withholding
stuff from the team?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.564
She could've told kensi and
deeks who they're protecting.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.666
Maybe it was classified.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.934
I didn't say it was classified.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.769
I said it was personal.
Hetty's contact

07:17.771 --> 07:19.137
Was personal.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.205
Mine wasn't work-related.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.773
Eh, it kind of was.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.708
Oh, so you did read it.
I only saw one name.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.577
I promise.
Doesn't matter.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.480
You won't be able to figure out
what I was working on anyway.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.516
Name was elwain spencer.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.953
Let's see. Spencer worked
on a dod contracting case

07:34.955 --> 07:37.022
For us about two years ago.

07:37.024 --> 07:40.559
He's a robotics expert for
the under secretary of defense.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.794
He's about your age.

07:42.796 --> 07:46.131
Robotics, engineering.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.467
I'm gonna guess he likes math.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.703
He's one of
your mathlete buddies, isn't he?

07:51.705 --> 07:54.706
You were planning
a mathlete reunion.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.641
I'm right, aren't I?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.510
(laughs) I am so right!

07:58.512 --> 07:59.578
You got lucky.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.179
Uh-huh.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.948
I got lucky twice.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.916
Look at that.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.958
(drill whirring)

08:16.029 --> 08:17.963
(chuckles)

08:17.965 --> 08:21.032
Someone's gonna have to tell
mabel she needs a new car.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.071
Coming into my house uninvited?

08:26.073 --> 08:27.806
That's just plain rude.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.207
Get out.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.642
Or you'll regret it.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.244
Not till you tell us
where you got this car.

08:32.246 --> 08:33.612
(chuckles)

08:33.614 --> 08:35.247
Listen, junior,

08:35.249 --> 08:37.182
We're not interested
in your business here.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.184
We're only interested
in that car

08:39.186 --> 08:42.120
And whatever you found
inside of it. All right?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.922
Rude and demanding.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.924
I don't think you realize

08:45.926 --> 08:46.925
What you've stepped into.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.994
A chop shop, maybe?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.229
Or who you're up against.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.164
(whirring)

08:55.302 --> 08:57.302
(grunting)

09:06.079 --> 09:08.146
(whirring)

09:10.584 --> 09:11.550
(whirring slows)

09:11.552 --> 09:12.284
Federal agents,

09:12.286 --> 09:13.151
Junior.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.219
Hey.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.021
Hey, why didn't you say so?

09:16.023 --> 09:17.756
I didn't know, okay?

09:17.758 --> 09:19.558
We're cool, right?

09:19.560 --> 09:22.694
Uh, one of my guys found the car
abandoned this morning.

09:22.696 --> 09:23.728
Abandoned?

09:23.730 --> 09:24.763
Well, you know,

09:24.765 --> 09:26.097
Unlocked.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.566
So he brought it here.

09:27.568 --> 09:28.700
Uh-huh.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.102
Uh, wait. Here. Um...

09:31.104 --> 09:33.171
Everything from the car

09:33.173 --> 09:34.973
Is in this bag.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.210
Uh...

09:38.211 --> 09:40.178
You're not gonna
arrest us, right?

09:40.180 --> 09:42.247
Only if you're still
here in ten seconds.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.316
Uh, come on, guys.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.985
Come on, man. (grunts)

09:48.589 --> 09:50.956
(door opens)

09:50.958 --> 09:52.958
Hetty didn't tell us.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.026
Thought there was a good
chance she'd send you guys.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.363
So are you allowed to tell us
what this is all about or...

09:58.365 --> 10:01.633
Six months ago, I was approached
by the state department.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.635
They heard about me
when hetty appeared

10:03.637 --> 10:05.236
Before
the congressional hearing.

10:05.238 --> 10:09.240
I ended up acting as a guide
for this guy, sy riggs.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.977
I took him all over the province
where I live in afghanistan.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.179
He was cataloging
historic sites.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.281
That's what he said, anyway.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.467
You didn't trust him?

10:18.468 --> 10:20.652
Uh, he kept a lot of stuff
from the security detail.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.855
The people we met,
things like that.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.857
Then I discovered
he was keeping a separate list

10:25.859 --> 10:27.192
Of places and contacts.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.294
I realized there were two lists,

10:29.296 --> 10:31.329
One for the state department,
one for him.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.031
So I contacted hetty.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.800
She flew me out to debrief me.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.802
(sighs)
someone tried to kill me

10:37.804 --> 10:39.988
When I went to meet her.

10:39.989 --> 10:42.173
You think riggs found out
you were in town?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.209
Looks that way.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.413
And here we are.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.122
I wonder if hetty has
anything to nosh on.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.223
You know?

10:58.225 --> 10:59.924
I think I'm about to get hungry.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.993
I'm gonna take a look.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.269
You look a lot better than
you did the last time I saw you.

11:11.271 --> 11:15.907
Bruises and shackles
aren't really my thing, so...

11:18.879 --> 11:20.712
You okay?

11:20.714 --> 11:23.114
Any nightmares?

11:25.986 --> 11:28.186
Not as many as before. You?

11:30.891 --> 11:33.091
Every night.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.328
Deeks:
So...

11:37.330 --> 11:39.397
Hetty's got the tv,
and I got the popcorn.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.335
We're on the clock.

11:45.472 --> 11:48.273
That is hetty's popcorn,
that is hetty's tv,

11:48.275 --> 11:49.941
And this...

11:49.943 --> 11:53.144
This is quite clearly
hetty's... Desk.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.946
Yeah, but here's the deal--
jack's not on the clock,

11:54.948 --> 11:57.315
Maybe jack wants to, you know,
watch a movie, eat some popcorn.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.383
Uh, no, thank you.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.285
Uh, the quiet is nice.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.204
Well, I'm gonna contact nell

12:02.205 --> 12:04.122
And find out
what she has on riggs.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.391
Now kensi's in case mode.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.194
(chuckles): There's not gonna be
a lot of quiet.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.730
(sighs)

12:12.499 --> 12:14.466
(footsteps approaching)

12:16.269 --> 12:19.771
Are you sure you weren't the one
that tried to poison me?

12:19.773 --> 12:21.306
(chuckles)

12:21.308 --> 12:23.775
When I was a girl,

12:23.777 --> 12:25.276
An old romany woman

12:25.278 --> 12:29.814
Taught me how to muddle
cypress and lavender.

12:29.816 --> 12:32.217
It's for the relief of stress.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.419
Sounds like a messy case, huh?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.421
It's too early in the day
for scotch.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.456
Listen, I know

12:38.458 --> 12:40.358
That what happened
in afghanistan

12:40.360 --> 12:43.762
May have complicated
your relationship with jack.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.930
Well, we saved his life.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.300
After he was targeted
by the cia.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.803
You need to debrief jack,

12:51.805 --> 12:54.339
Find out everything he knows.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.475
So you're giving
the orders today?

12:58.411 --> 13:00.311
The important ones.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.116
Oh, listen-- make sure

13:05.118 --> 13:07.218
They take good care of my stuff.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.159
You know what's weird?

13:14.161 --> 13:15.260
One day hard drives

13:15.262 --> 13:18.229
And sim cards
will be antiquities.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.431
Archaeologists
will dig 'em up,

13:20.433 --> 13:22.567
Download the data
of ancient societies.

13:22.569 --> 13:25.303
Hmm. Kind of like
a computer science version

13:25.305 --> 13:27.138
Of indiana jones.
Ooh.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.440
But he'd still wear a fedora
and carry a bullwhip.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.341
Definitely.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.442
You know what?

13:31.444 --> 13:32.443
My history professor

13:32.445 --> 13:34.212
Used to call me indiana jones.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.280
Hmm.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.448
I was
nell "indiana jones" jones.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.550
I could see you

13:38.552 --> 13:39.818
Rocking a fedora.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.152
But you'd still need a bullwhip.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.387
Watch it.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.122
What? No, no,
because you'd be, like...

13:44.124 --> 13:45.123
Dressed up like indiana jones.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.157
No, I know,

13:46.159 --> 13:48.326
I like it.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.195
Eric: Callen.
Bring us some takeout?

13:50.197 --> 13:52.297
Evidence from the chop shop.
Sam's making some calls.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.399
I thought we could try
and figure this out.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.267
Hmm.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.503
Let's see.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.004
Ah.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.040
Receipt from a parking garage
on figueroa.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.276
Here's a donut wrapper.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.378
A flyer for
a burlesque show.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.981
If we triangulate
the three pieces of evidence

14:09.983 --> 14:12.317
And put them on a map
like so...

14:12.319 --> 14:14.385
Oh. The pod inn.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.855
The driver who shot
at jack must have stayed

14:16.857 --> 14:18.389
At the pod inn on 3rd street.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.059
I know this, because the pod inn
is part of a national chain

14:21.061 --> 14:23.194
That only sells
this type of donuts

14:23.196 --> 14:25.196
In their vending machine.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.131
Wow. You really<i> are </i>
indiana jones.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.366
Well, my friends and I stayed

14:28.368 --> 14:30.201
At a lot of those motels
one summer.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.404
We would have parties,

14:32.405 --> 14:34.606
And then buy a bunch of donuts
from the vending machines.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.507
Sounds to me like
someone spent a summer

14:36.509 --> 14:37.442
Following a band around.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.978
Send me the address.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.046
(imitates whip cracking)

14:43.316 --> 14:44.515
(beeping)
(sighs)

14:44.517 --> 14:46.117
Can't get through.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.086
You calling home?
Yeah.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.954
Deeks: You know,
our ops team's

14:49.956 --> 14:51.122
Got a pretty powerful telecom.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.557
I could see
if they could help out.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.192
(clears throat):
No, that's okay.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.627
I'll, uh, I'll try again later.

14:55.629 --> 14:57.528
Sat phone coverage
gets kind of flaky

14:57.530 --> 14:59.063
In my village sometimes.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.597
Just want to check
on my wife and kids.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.667
You're remarried?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.435
I didn't know.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.138
Last year.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.473
Oh.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.174
Uh, what's her...
What's her name?

15:10.176 --> 15:12.110
Laila.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.278
That's a beautiful name.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.479
She's a good woman.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.414
You'd like her.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.585
(phone rings)

15:20.587 --> 15:23.554
Nell, uh, said that
riggs's phone is still off.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.423
Callen and sam
are headed to a motel

15:25.425 --> 15:26.691
With a lead on the shooter.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.628
How do we know you're not
just back there playing tetris?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.230
Really?

15:32.232 --> 15:34.032
(laughs softly)
when I was home on furlough,

15:34.034 --> 15:35.333
Kensi and I
would play tetris

15:35.335 --> 15:37.635
And eat burritos
one night a week.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.270
Called it tetritos night.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.705
Deeks:
Huh. That's funny.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.440
We call that a Wednesday night.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.374
(knocking)

15:43.376 --> 15:45.376
Bedroom.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.613
(groans)

15:50.016 --> 15:51.449
Granger.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.351
That's how you get shot.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.585
Can I come in?

15:54.587 --> 15:56.321
By all means.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.527
Hey, jack.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.778
It's been a while.

16:03.779 --> 16:05.028
Can't say I'm pleased
to see you.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.465
Aw, we're all friends here.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.501
Why don't you do a sweep
of the perimeter.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.636
We just did one.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.574
Although, you can never do
too many perimeter sweeps.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.080
(door closes)

16:22.082 --> 16:23.348
(lock clicks)

16:23.350 --> 16:25.016
Sam:
<i> We're looking for a guy.</i>

16:25.018 --> 16:26.517
He may have been driving
a car like this.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.052
Yeah.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.586
Yeah, he checked in
last night around 9:00.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.189
He nearly ran me over

16:31.191 --> 16:32.991
On his way
into the parking lot.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.726
The car's gone,
but he's still here.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.394
What room?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.132
Room 129.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.433
The far end.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.444
Federal agents!

16:54.381 --> 16:56.080
(footsteps in distance)

16:57.317 --> 16:58.449
Hey!

17:02.655 --> 17:04.322
(gunshots)

17:06.426 --> 17:08.393
(groans)

17:13.767 --> 17:16.034
(slides gun away)

17:22.308 --> 17:23.508
Call's dead.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.477
So is he.

17:38.124 --> 17:41.092
Sam: Yeah, the front desk
employee's name was al yasin.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.594
I'm sending you a number he
was calling as he did a runner.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.730
Eric: Al yasin. All right,
I'll run it, get back to you.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.665
(sighs)
there's nothing in the car.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.400
(sighs):
Yep.

17:51.504 --> 17:55.139
Yasin received a text
about an hour ago.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.407
Whoever texted him

17:56.409 --> 17:57.475
Signed their name geb.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.444
Jeb as in bush?

17:59.446 --> 18:01.712
G-e-b.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.248
G-e-b.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.783
Ancient egyptians worshipped geb
as a god of the underworld.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.319
Huh.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.620
Well, I don't think
any egyptian gods

18:09.622 --> 18:11.289
Were texting this guy.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.524
Nell and eric are trying
to find out who was.

18:16.696 --> 18:20.598
I left my family halfway
around the world once, too.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.666
You served?

18:21.668 --> 18:22.767
Marines.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.335
Like you.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.536
I appreciate

18:25.537 --> 18:26.736
You trying to get me
on your side,

18:26.739 --> 18:28.372
But you don't have to do that.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.544
So, this list riggs kept...

18:33.546 --> 18:35.513
Tell me about it.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.216
I guess he was like me.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.751
Wrote everything down.

18:40.753 --> 18:44.122
Everything.
Like some kind of historian.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.223
Okay.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.692
I want you to do me a favor.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.193
Write down the names

18:49.195 --> 18:51.896
Of all the villages
you went to with riggs.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.802
So, you call hetty up,

18:57.804 --> 18:59.604
She tells you to hop on a plane

18:59.606 --> 19:02.540
And fly 8,000 miles...

19:02.542 --> 19:04.675
And you do it.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.244
Why?

19:08.481 --> 19:09.847
The taliban and al-qaeda

19:09.849 --> 19:12.283
Are trying to break our cities.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.585
Our villages, our very culture.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.756
I want to help my new country
stand on its feet.

19:20.793 --> 19:21.726
You know, when...

19:21.728 --> 19:24.162
When my first wife...

19:24.164 --> 19:25.897
Was killed by that drone strike,

19:25.899 --> 19:27.665
I hated the u.S.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.335
I wanted to pick up a rifle.

19:33.806 --> 19:37.241
But I knew if I did that,
the violence would never stop.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.414
I'm doing this for my country,
not yours.

19:45.652 --> 19:47.251
Deeks:
<i> Being around jack</i>

19:47.253 --> 19:49.720
Is getting to you, isn't it?

19:49.722 --> 19:51.856
I think I'm managing
just fine.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.257
You're the one
who's trying to be a hero.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.692
(scoffs) I offered him
popcorn and a movie,

19:54.694 --> 19:55.893
Neither of which were mine.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.828
You have to admit
it's crazy, though--

19:57.830 --> 20:00.331
He shows up the day
we move in together.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.532
I mean, not that that's fault.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.733
I'm not saying it's his fault.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.802
I'm just saying it's,
you know, crazy.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.840
When jack broke off
the engagement, um...

20:12.912 --> 20:15.313
...I felt pretty helpless.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.782
I-I... (sighs)

20:17.784 --> 20:20.384
I didn't really know
how to be there for him.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.720
Um, and he had...

20:22.722 --> 20:25.856
Posttraumatic stress,
and all I could do was cry.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.291
(clears throat)

20:27.293 --> 20:28.559
And that's what
anyone would do

20:28.561 --> 20:30.895
In that situation,
and you got through it.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.663
Yeah, till afghanistan.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.233
Just... Finding him there

20:35.235 --> 20:38.502
And saving his life and almost
losing mine in the process...

20:38.504 --> 20:39.604
(sniffles)

20:39.606 --> 20:41.739
Yeah, but you got
through that, too.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.341
Listen, here's the deal, kens.

20:43.342 --> 20:44.942
If you got stuff
you need to say to him,

20:44.944 --> 20:46.611
Then you need to say it.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.446
You know, otherwise,
it just...

20:48.448 --> 20:50.615
Just lives inside you.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.853
Yeah?

20:55.855 --> 20:57.922
I know.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.859
The call we pulled
from yasin's phone

21:01.861 --> 21:03.661
Was made
from a prepaid sat phone.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.730
And riggs called jack
from a sat phone

21:05.732 --> 21:06.931
When he got to the u.S.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.366
Riggs finds out
that jack's in town,

21:08.368 --> 21:09.934
Panics that
he may tell all,

21:09.936 --> 21:11.502
Hires yasin to kill him.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.837
What about
the text from geb,

21:12.839 --> 21:14.839
Our egyptian god?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.040
(line ringing)

21:16.042 --> 21:17.642
Granger:
Yeah?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.877
Granger, ask jack
if the name geb--

21:19.879 --> 21:21.912
G-e-b--
means anything to him.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.682
The name geb-- g-e-b--

21:24.684 --> 21:26.717
Does that mean
anything to you?

21:26.719 --> 21:28.686
No.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.654
Could have been a code name,
maybe, for someone else?

21:30.657 --> 21:33.024
There-there was one guy
he-he mentioned a lot,

21:33.026 --> 21:34.692
But I never met him.

21:34.694 --> 21:37.228
Salib.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.763
Riggs would text him on
his sat phone nearly every day.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.116
All right, thanks, jack.

21:42.117 --> 21:44.467
The names salib and geb
both have egyptian ties.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.470
Maybe salib
used the name geb

21:46.472 --> 21:48.673
When he texted yasin and riggs.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.608
Hey, check this out--
so there's a guy

21:50.610 --> 21:53.577
Named salib,
he's an antiquities dealer.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.880
Egyptian-american
and lives in los angeles.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.348
Specializes in

21:57.350 --> 21:58.949
Insuring rare items.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.318
Business looks legit.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.386
Well, let's see how legit.

22:03.890 --> 22:04.889
(line ringing)

22:04.891 --> 22:06.975
Man: Yes?

22:06.976 --> 22:09.060
Yeah, uh, I understand
you insure rare items.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.828
Uh, so, listen,
my grandfather keeps telling me

22:10.830 --> 22:12.697
About this rare coin he has.
He keeps it

22:12.699 --> 22:14.899
In a cigar box,
and a friend of mine suggested

22:14.901 --> 22:16.901
That I call and ask for geb?

22:16.903 --> 22:18.803
He's not here.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.971
Okay, I'll, uh, I'll call back.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.973
Thanks.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.942
Looks like a new buyer's
about to give riggs

22:24.944 --> 22:27.712
An offer he can't refuse.

22:27.714 --> 22:28.913
(knocking)

22:28.915 --> 22:30.381
Kensi:
Kensi and deeks.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.018
Come bearing gifts.
Yeah,

22:34.020 --> 22:35.686
Cream, no sugar.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.821
You remembered.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.023
Yeah. Where's granger?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.358
Jack:
Uh, in the other room,

22:40.359 --> 22:41.692
Catching up on e-mails.
(scoffs)

22:41.694 --> 22:42.927
Or secretly taking a nap.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.029
(chuckles)

22:45.031 --> 22:46.630
Oh, sorry, you gonna...
Are you praying?

22:46.632 --> 22:47.998
N-no, no, just, uh,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.134
Used to sitting
on the ground.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.969
Well, that's good news,
'cause it turns out

22:51.971 --> 22:54.105
That chair-sitting
is actually bad for your health.

22:54.107 --> 22:57.408
Oh, my gosh, he's gonna
sell you on a treadmill desk.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.776
I get lots of exercise.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.077
Not just herding goats.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.879
Got a weekly
village basketball game.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.381
(computer trilling)

23:04.117 --> 23:05.449
Guys...

23:05.451 --> 23:07.118
Riggs just turned on his phone.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.586
And the hunt is on.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.020
Ready to trace.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.989
(line ringing)

23:11.991 --> 23:13.124
Hello?

23:13.126 --> 23:15.760
Mr. Riggs.
As-salaam alaikum

23:15.762 --> 23:18.763
How did you get this number?

23:18.765 --> 23:21.132
My apologies on the unexpected
call, but I'm ready

23:21.134 --> 23:22.967
To pay a lot of money
for something you're selling.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.102
Who says I'm selling anything?

23:25.104 --> 23:28.539
No need to hide
your intentions, mr. Riggs.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.842
How much do I need to prove
I'm a genuine buyer?

23:31.844 --> 23:35.045
Half a million dollars.

23:35.047 --> 23:37.148
That's a lot of money.

23:37.150 --> 23:38.883
But it's worth it
if my associates

23:38.885 --> 23:40.985
Can benefit
from your information.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.086
Of course, I'll need to see
what it is I'm buying, first.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.056
Meet me at arbor hills,
north side lot.

23:46.058 --> 23:49.126
Bring cash. You'll be in
competition with another buyer.

23:49.128 --> 23:52.062
You have 30 minutes to show
or else I leave.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.598
I'll be there.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.000
Nell: All right,
we've narrowed riggs' location

23:56.002 --> 23:57.902
Down to a four-block radius.

23:57.904 --> 24:01.038
Arbor hills is
an empty retail space.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.175
No working security
cameras on premises,

24:04.177 --> 24:06.177
Couple of cameras
on adjacent properties.

24:06.179 --> 24:08.012
He knew what he was doing
when he picked it.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.146
30 minutes-- clock is ticking.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.148
Brief granger,
tell him to bring kensi.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.883
Will do.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.952
Nell just called--

24:14.954 --> 24:16.520
Sam's meeting with riggs
to buy the list.

24:16.522 --> 24:17.588
I need you on overwatch.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.557
Deeks, you're with jack.

24:20.526 --> 24:21.525
Good luck.
Kensi: Thanks.

24:21.527 --> 24:22.760
(door opens)

24:22.762 --> 24:24.495
Go get 'em, tiger.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.965
Did you see that look?

24:27.967 --> 24:31.168
I just got the "do not say
anything inappropriate" look.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.670
Oh, yeah, I-I know that look.

24:32.672 --> 24:33.938
(short chuckle)

24:38.678 --> 24:40.945
No sign of riggs.
Or anyone else, for that matter.

24:46.219 --> 24:48.018
Granger:
Kensi, you got sam?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.119
I got him.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.021
Jack and kensi
getting along okay?

24:51.023 --> 24:53.858
I'm still on comms.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.192
And yes, we are.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.561
Thank you for asking.

24:57.563 --> 25:00.164
Eric:
Okay, here we go.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.566
Riggs just got out
of a cab at an intersection

25:02.568 --> 25:04.268
On the north side
of the meeting spot.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.971
Granger:
You sure it's him?

25:07.907 --> 25:09.073
No mistake--

25:09.075 --> 25:10.541
That's our man.

25:10.543 --> 25:11.642
Where is he now?

25:11.644 --> 25:13.844
(phone rings)

25:13.846 --> 25:14.945
Running late?

25:14.947 --> 25:16.847
Took you for a smaller guy.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.883
I don't see you anywhere--
how do I know you're here?

25:18.885 --> 25:20.951
Riggs:
The black kufi is a nice touch.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.786
Come meet me, we'll talk.

25:22.788 --> 25:23.988
Kens, can you see him?

25:23.990 --> 25:26.123
I'm looking.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.997
I got him.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.935
Second floor of
an industrial garage, northwest,

25:37.937 --> 25:39.803
About 100 yards out.

25:39.805 --> 25:41.171
Riggs is with someone.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.773
It looks like salib.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.810
And sam,

25:46.812 --> 25:48.112
Riggs is watching you
with optics.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.914
Someone here
wants to talk to you.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.248
Okay.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.952
Who's this?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.258
Kensi:
Guys, I lost sight of him.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.961
He hung up.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.880
(tires screeching)

26:05.881 --> 26:07.798
Kensi: And they're
making a break for it.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.966
Callen:
On our way, sam.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.101
It's too late, guys.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.269
They're gone.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.605
Sam:
Nell, track those guys.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.062
Tell me we at least have
eyes on them, guys.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.763
Eric: Salib and riggs
are heading north

26:39.765 --> 26:40.864
On the freeway.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.232
Traffic cam coverage
is patchy at best.

26:42.234 --> 26:43.767
We might lose 'em.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.237
Don't.

26:46.238 --> 26:48.706
There was something about
the way salib talked to me.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.807
What, threatening?

26:50.776 --> 26:52.376
Smug.

26:52.378 --> 26:55.813
They weren't interested
in selling the list.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.881
Salib just wanted
to see my face.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.986
And now we've seen his.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.727
Half of these books
are in languages

27:09.729 --> 27:10.861
I don't even recognize.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.396
We got a tech
operator that swears

27:12.398 --> 27:14.665
He saw hetty read
via osmosis.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.335
Riggs got away.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.336
He left with salib.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.704
We're tracking them now.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.308
They'd be easier to track
back in afghanistan.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.243
Well, we like everything
instant here, you know?

27:26.245 --> 27:29.647
Instant gratification,
instant streaming on netflix.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.715
What's netflix?

27:34.687 --> 27:35.720
(chuckles)

27:35.721 --> 27:36.754
Oh, you're serious.
You don't-you don't know what...

27:36.756 --> 27:37.788
You don't know what netflix is?

27:37.790 --> 27:39.790
I...

27:39.792 --> 27:42.793
No, I...

27:42.795 --> 27:45.796
Come to find
the greatest happiness

27:45.798 --> 27:48.432
Comes from, uh, simple things.

27:48.434 --> 27:51.168
The love of a family.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.836
Or a woman.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.941
Was kensi really messy
when you guys were together?

27:57.943 --> 27:59.109
(sighs)

27:59.111 --> 28:01.812
Clothes and trash everywhere.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.147
There was this
one time where

28:03.149 --> 28:05.149
She left a trail of crumbs--
like, muffin crumbs--

28:05.151 --> 28:07.284
That started in her car
and went all the way

28:07.286 --> 28:09.186
Into the house, up the steps
and into her closet.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.422
Like, hansel and gretel could
have followed these crumbs.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.357
Yeah.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.291
I-I found her t-shirt
in the microwave once.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.827
(laughs)

28:18.698 --> 28:20.764
We're moving in together.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.400
Congratulations.

28:23.402 --> 28:24.468
It's her idea.

28:24.470 --> 28:25.736
Not that I'm not
excited about it,

28:25.738 --> 28:26.937
'cause I am excited about it.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.205
It's just, you know, it's...

28:28.207 --> 28:29.940
It's a big step.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.475
Yeah, it's a big step
for both of us.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.444
I don't know
why I just said that.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.847
You did torture someone for her.

28:36.849 --> 28:39.149
Boy, you don't...
You don't hold back, do you?

28:39.151 --> 28:40.884
Don't need to.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.721
You know
what's crazy about that?

28:43.723 --> 28:46.757
Is that as awful
as that experience was...

28:46.759 --> 28:48.726
In torturing that guy...

28:48.728 --> 28:50.794
I'd do it again in a heartbeat

28:50.796 --> 28:53.197
If it meant
saving somebody that I love.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.866
Still weighs on you.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.468
And last month
I woke up yelling,

28:57.470 --> 28:58.902
Top of my lungs,

28:58.904 --> 29:01.205
And now that's gonna be...

29:01.207 --> 29:03.207
In front of kensi.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.776
Then don't push her away.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.845
Like I did.

29:09.014 --> 29:11.115
(knocking)

29:11.117 --> 29:12.750
Hetty give you a gun?
She offered,

29:12.752 --> 29:14.017
I declined.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.819
That might have been
a mistake.

29:15.821 --> 29:16.987
Kensi:
It's us.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.158
Thank you.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.893
(phone rings)

29:22.895 --> 29:24.361
Excuse me.
That'll be my family now.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.904
Hetty:
Hello there.

29:33.906 --> 29:34.838
Oh.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.140
Hetty: Hi.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.341
Coming. Hey.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.809
Uh-huh.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.944
Okay, how's that?

29:40.946 --> 29:42.312
Hmm. You look as though

29:42.314 --> 29:44.782
You have some kind
of posture problem, mr. Deeks.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.217
No, no. It's not
so much my posture

29:47.219 --> 29:51.021
As much as it's the-the desk
is for... It's... Mm.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.257
Listen to me.
We need kensi and granger

29:53.259 --> 29:55.392
Back with callen and sam.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.461
Nell.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.897
We picked up riggs' car
in marina del rey.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.498
Coordinates are already
on your phones.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.567
Okay, we're on it.
(grunts)

30:09.241 --> 30:10.541
Is everything okay?

30:10.543 --> 30:12.009
Yeah, yeah.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.344
Um, my family's safe.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.913
Everyone's good.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.080
Cool.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.949
Kensi, ready?

30:18.951 --> 30:20.250
Yes.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.922
Uh, actually, I'm gonna go.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.590
I need to stretch my legs.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.331
Granger.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.935
(door closes, locks)

30:40.105 --> 30:42.306
I have something
I'd like to say about

30:42.308 --> 30:45.209
The way I treated you
after we split up.

30:45.211 --> 30:48.011
(sighs)
no need to go there.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.613
But I still want to apologize

30:49.615 --> 30:53.083
For never having called you
after they rescued us.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.252
I didn't call you, either.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.120
Okay, so we're both jerks.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.094
You know, after we broke up,

31:04.096 --> 31:06.230
I was, uh...

31:06.232 --> 31:08.398
I was living in afghanistan.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.900
Mm-hmm.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.870
Trying to decide
if I'd convert to islam.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.205
It was...

31:15.207 --> 31:17.007
It was hard.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.345
Life was hard.

31:21.347 --> 31:24.982
Uh, one day I-I bought
a plane ticket

31:24.984 --> 31:25.949
Back home to the states.

31:25.951 --> 31:28.018
I was gonna...

31:29.288 --> 31:31.555
...Gonna try and get you back.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.157
Why didn't you?

31:36.061 --> 31:38.629
Realized I'd be running away
from who I really am.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.167
Doesn't mean
I didn't love you, kensi.

31:45.638 --> 31:47.671
I get it.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.642
So, you and deeks
are-are moving in together.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.444
(chuckles)
yeah.

31:54.446 --> 31:55.646
Today, supposedly.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.681
You two are gonna do great.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.017
I hope so.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.053
Although I hear
he's kind of messy.

32:03.054 --> 32:05.087
That is the last time
I leave you two together alone.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.556
The last time.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.566
Body.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.572
Callen:
It's riggs.

32:22.574 --> 32:23.573
He's dead.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.175
Looks like
he was beaten.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.243
Tortured.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.179
Fingers are broken.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.014
Salib and riggs left
in the same car.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.599
(line ringing)

32:32.600 --> 32:34.183
There's only one reason
why salib kills riggs.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.385
The list.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.322
Where exactly did riggs
keep this list?

32:38.324 --> 32:40.557
Jack said it was a notebook.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.193
A notebook like this?

32:44.596 --> 32:45.595
Granger: Salib tortures
and kills riggs

32:45.597 --> 32:47.664
For the list, then destroys it.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.132
Doesn't add up.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.267
Maybe it was more

32:50.269 --> 32:51.969
Than just a list
of antiquities sites.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.070
What if it's about
people he met?

32:53.072 --> 32:54.604
Important people.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.107
Jack thought some
of 'em might be taliban.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.076
Jack was with riggs
in afghanistan.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.011
That explains why salib tried
to kill him.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.580
Riggs had
jack's sat phone number.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.415
Jack got a call
at the apartment.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.650
Yeah, but that was his wife.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.186
Come on. No.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.054
No, no. There's no way

33:11.056 --> 33:12.255
That jack would give salib
his location.

33:12.257 --> 33:15.125
Not even to save his family
in afghanistan?

33:32.478 --> 33:34.295
(grunts)

33:34.296 --> 33:36.113
Remember those dirt bikes
we rode in joshua tree?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.514
Oh, yeah, of course I do.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.549
Best camping trip ever.

33:39.551 --> 33:40.784
Wide open desert.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.552
Beautiful starry sky.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.087
Mmm.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.089
That's every night
in my village.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.391
Wow.

33:48.327 --> 33:49.559
(phone rings)

33:52.231 --> 33:53.296
What's up?

33:53.298 --> 33:54.731
Deeks:
Ask jack who called him.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.234
Jack, who called you

33:57.236 --> 33:58.668
On the sat phone?

33:59.471 --> 34:01.271
I'm sorry.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.407
Jack, who called you
on the sat phone?

34:03.409 --> 34:05.275
It was salib.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.643
What?
He said it was my life

34:06.645 --> 34:08.078
Or my family's.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.313
He said if I didn't tell him
where I was,

34:10.315 --> 34:12.182
His people would kill my wife,

34:12.184 --> 34:13.683
My daughters
back in afghanistan.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.052
Deeks,

34:15.053 --> 34:16.420
Salib is coming for jack.
Tell eric and nell

34:16.421 --> 34:17.788
To keep eyes on the building.
Hang tight.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.256
We're on our way.

34:19.258 --> 34:21.324
Where you going?
I told salib

34:21.326 --> 34:23.360
I'd wait in the alley.
No, no, no, no, no.
Are you kidding me?

34:23.362 --> 34:26.363
You can't do that. Jack, stop.
Jack, stop it! Jack...

34:26.365 --> 34:27.347
Down!

34:27.348 --> 34:28.330
(rapid gunshots)

34:35.808 --> 34:37.607
Nell: Kens, we've got eyes
on the hallway.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.376
There are three shooters.

34:39.378 --> 34:40.477
Tell me when, nell!

34:47.252 --> 34:48.719
Now.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.187
One down, two to go.

34:50.189 --> 34:51.421
I need backup.

34:51.423 --> 34:52.856
The guys are almost with you.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.391
Jack, go.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.460
(gunshots)

34:58.430 --> 35:00.130
Eric:
Two more entering the building

35:00.132 --> 35:01.665
And two still in the hallway.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.366
One on the balcony.

35:03.368 --> 35:05.168
It's turning out to be
a very bad party.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.207
Oh, no.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.709
Kens, we are now blind
in the hallway.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.344
Guys, where are you?!

35:19.384 --> 35:20.317
(tires screech)

35:20.319 --> 35:22.452
(distant gunfire)

35:22.454 --> 35:23.753
We got the balcony.

35:23.755 --> 35:24.654
Sam, on your right.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.160
(distant gunfire continues)

35:32.364 --> 35:33.130
Jack!

35:35.367 --> 35:36.533
(grunting)

35:38.804 --> 35:40.904
(neck cracks)

35:42.474 --> 35:45.575
(grunting)

35:47.479 --> 35:48.812
You're done.

35:48.814 --> 35:51.314
No, wait. It's me you want.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.482
(panting)

35:57.222 --> 35:59.189
Nell:
Ten seconds.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.491
(quietly):
Tell them to come in shooting.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.392
Kill him.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.527
Jack, get down.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.328
Get down.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.363
Kill him!

36:14.506 --> 36:15.939
Kens!

36:15.940 --> 36:17.373
Another nice place.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.675
It was.

36:19.845 --> 36:20.844
You okay?

36:20.846 --> 36:22.245
(groans)

36:22.247 --> 36:23.713
What took you so long?

36:23.715 --> 36:25.282
Clear.

36:25.284 --> 36:25.916
Clear.

36:25.918 --> 36:27.417
My family.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.453
They're gonna kill my family.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.591
Your family is safe, jack.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.262
Hello?

36:44.670 --> 36:46.736
(sniffles)

36:50.809 --> 36:51.875
(beep)

36:53.645 --> 36:56.580
Jack, I would never ask you here

36:56.582 --> 36:58.481
Without considering

36:58.483 --> 37:00.550
The risks involved.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.520
There was a seal team
watching over them

37:03.522 --> 37:05.722
From the moment you left them.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.492
Thank you, hetty.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.762
Owen, we need

37:12.764 --> 37:14.831
To get this young man home.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.677
(phone chimes)

37:27.679 --> 37:29.479
(chuckles)

37:29.481 --> 37:31.982
Craig nassir's opening
a tab down at pelican's.

37:31.984 --> 37:34.985
Ncis-- 50 years young.

37:34.987 --> 37:36.786
That's not till next week.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.521
You know craig likes a party.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.557
Ah. Kens?

37:40.559 --> 37:42.459
A little pre-50th cocktail?

37:43.695 --> 37:44.995
Uh, no, I'm good, actually.

37:44.997 --> 37:46.463
I got some stuff
to wrap up here.

37:46.465 --> 37:47.464
All right.
You sure?

37:47.466 --> 37:48.465
Yeah. You guys have fun.

37:48.467 --> 37:49.466
Good night.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.634
Bye.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.979
(clears throat)

38:05.450 --> 38:06.783
(sighs)

38:13.959 --> 38:16.559
I handed jack's account
of his trip with riggs

38:16.561 --> 38:18.361
To the proper authorities.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.148
They'll watch extra carefully

38:21.149 --> 38:22.999
For anything from that region
coming into the country.

38:23.001 --> 38:25.335
And the list of names?

38:26.538 --> 38:29.339
I already sent a copy
to the pentagon.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.574
Our intel people are putting

38:31.576 --> 38:34.544
The names into the database.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.513
At least six of them
are high value targets

38:36.515 --> 38:38.348
We've been trying to locate
for months.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.983
So, all in all,

38:39.985 --> 38:41.484
A successful outcome.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.721
Almost a costly one, owen.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.891
Ms. Blye.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.503
Good night, hetty.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.905
Good night, owen.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.973
Good night, blye.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.710
You wanted to talk to me?

39:06.712 --> 39:09.045
No, I think it's you

39:09.047 --> 39:12.449
Who wants to talk to me,
ms. Blye.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.588
I don't understand why jack had
to come all the way out here.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.123
After everything
he's been through already.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.026
You're questioning my judgment?

39:23.028 --> 39:24.461
No.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.696
Yes.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.931
We used him, hetty.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.632
We used jack.

39:31.436 --> 39:34.070
In our line of work,

39:34.072 --> 39:37.707
Sometimes we ask people

39:37.709 --> 39:40.610
To put themselves

39:40.612 --> 39:41.878
In harm's way.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.480
I know that.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.715
It's just a really hard lesson
to keep learning.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.051
It is, indeed.

39:53.458 --> 39:54.924
Come here.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.498
(chuckles)

40:01.500 --> 40:03.133
Ooh.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.668
I'll see you tomorrow, ms. Blye.

40:05.670 --> 40:08.071
Yes, you will.

40:12.677 --> 40:14.744
No! That doesn't look
as... Oh, my god,

40:14.746 --> 40:16.613
You play this
exactly like kensi.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.581
No, she plays
exactly like I do.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.116
What does that mean?
You taught her this?

40:20.118 --> 40:21.518
A long time ago.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.853
Okay, here's the deal:
You have to teach me

40:23.855 --> 40:26.589
What you taught her
so I can then beat her.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.925
Some advice about kensi...

40:28.927 --> 40:30.126
Get a maid.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.594
Got it.

40:31.596 --> 40:32.829
Never let her go.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.031
The maid or kensi?

40:35.033 --> 40:36.733
Both.

40:36.735 --> 40:37.801
(door closes)

40:37.803 --> 40:39.169
Fair enough.

40:39.171 --> 40:40.804
I got it.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.140
(clears throat)

40:44.142 --> 40:45.742
Oh, I see you're
playing cards.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.143
We're not gonna talk
about that.
(chuckles)

40:47.145 --> 40:50.547
Listen, so I was thinking
maybe, uh, jack should stay

40:50.549 --> 40:51.648
With us tonight.

40:51.650 --> 40:52.882
That is a good idea.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.184
I mean, 'cause our couch

40:54.186 --> 40:55.785
Doesn't have bullet holes in it.
Seems like the...

40:55.787 --> 40:56.920
It does not.
Thank you,

40:56.922 --> 40:58.788
But, uh,
I have a plane to catch.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.791
Okay. Well, in that case,
we'll drive you to the airport.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.928
Uh, actually, kensi can drive
you to the airport,

41:04.930 --> 41:07.730
'cause I have very important
things to attend to.

41:07.732 --> 41:10.133
Well, thanks, but, uh,
I've already got a ride.

41:10.135 --> 41:11.768
Deeks:
Oh.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.136
Granger danger.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.205
All right. Good luck with that.

41:16.741 --> 41:17.740
Be safe.

41:17.742 --> 41:19.242
You, too.

41:19.243 --> 41:20.743
I'm gonna go talk to granger
about my feelings.

41:23.515 --> 41:25.048
Bye.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.883
Thank you again.

41:26.885 --> 41:27.951
Deeks is a good one.

41:27.953 --> 41:28.952
(chuckles)

41:28.954 --> 41:30.620
He is.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.021
(chuckles)

41:34.159 --> 41:36.626
Be safe. And take care, okay?

41:36.628 --> 41:38.695
Yeah. You, too.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.802
All set.

41:50.108 --> 41:52.041
Well, I'm not gonna lie,

41:52.043 --> 41:53.776
That was a hell of a day.

41:53.778 --> 41:56.246
Yes, it was.

41:56.248 --> 41:58.181
Started off okay though.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.916
Did it? I don't remember.
Mm-hmm.

41:59.918 --> 42:00.917
Mmm.

42:00.919 --> 42:03.086
Mmm.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.754
We moved in together.

42:04.756 --> 42:05.722
Oh, that's right.
Now I remember.

42:05.724 --> 42:07.190
We moved in together.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.292
Speaking of which, we should
probably take the audi,

42:09.294 --> 42:11.027
Go to your house,
grab the first load,

42:11.029 --> 42:13.563
Go back to my house,
unpack it.

42:13.565 --> 42:16.099
Or we could just
go get takeout noodles.

42:17.536 --> 42:19.536
Let's go grab my stuff.

42:19.538 --> 42:20.837
What about the noodles?

42:20.839 --> 42:23.840
I think we'll always make time
for noodles.
