you're not a good role model

03:16.947 --> 03:19.370
for girls because you only care
about beauty and fashion,

03:19.370 --> 03:20.621

09:19.850 --> 09:21.481
What? How?

09:21.481 --> 09:23.023
They could be anyone
in the world.

09:23.023 --> 09:24.274
Well, then I better
start looking

09:24.274 --> 09:26.607
because until I meet
this slime-ball face-to-face,

09:26.607 --> 09:28.068
I may never be funny again.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.279
Frankie, wait.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.032
When someone messes with you,

09:32.032 --> 09:33.904
they mess with "Bizaardvark."

09:33.904 --> 09:35.075
Let's find this troll.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.907
Thanks, Paige.

09:36.907 --> 09:39.960
Right now I feel like
the biggest loser in the world.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.202
(muffled screams)

09:43.914 --> 09:45.876
Okay, second biggest.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.878
(muffled screams)

09:47.878 --> 09:49.129
(coughs)

09:55.806 --> 09:58.058
To help find this hater,
I called the best

09:58.058 --> 10:00.020
cyber forensics team
in the city.

10:00.020 --> 10:02.983
But they were busy
solving real crimes.

10:02.983 --> 10:06.026
Ah-ha. I found something
with my microscope.

10:06.026 --> 10:07.728
I don't get it.

10:07.728 --> 10:09.609
What does a microscope
have to do with finding
a hater online?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.992
Oh, it doesn't.

10:11.992 --> 10:14.074
I was just trying
to look smart.

10:14.074 --> 10:15.495
Did you buy it?

10:15.495 --> 10:18.078
Well, considering
this is a kaleidoscope, no.

10:24.414 --> 10:27.087
Dirk, looks like
you're making progress.

10:27.087 --> 10:29.089
Oh, this?
This is about something else.

10:29.089 --> 10:31.011
You don't need
to worry about it.

10:31.011 --> 10:33.924
You don't want
to worry about it.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.137
Okay.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.349
-I found him!
-You found the hater?

10:39.349 --> 10:42.763
No, this video of a squirrel
jumping on a trampoline.

10:42.763 --> 10:44.815
Look how high he's bouncing.

10:44.815 --> 10:46.066
Higher...

10:47.067 --> 10:49.069
-higher...
 -(hawk screeches)

10:49.069 --> 10:50.110
Oh!

10:50.110 --> 10:52.612
That hawk came out of nowhere!

10:52.612 --> 10:53.864
(phone chimes)

10:55.035 --> 10:56.236
Another mean comment?

10:56.236 --> 10:57.577
What am I supposed to do?

10:57.577 --> 10:58.909
I have an idea.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.492
If they're online right now,

11:02.492 --> 11:03.994
we can search
the I.P. address

11:03.994 --> 11:05.746
and determine
the computer's exact location.

11:06.957 --> 11:07.958
(computer beeps)

11:09.339 --> 11:10.500
Hollander Prep.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.342
Our school! Of course!

11:12.342 --> 11:14.925
They're all a bunch
of smarty pants who think
they're better than us.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.176
I should've known.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.968
I shoulda known!

11:20.010 --> 11:21.601
Paige, frantically follow me!

11:24.144 --> 11:25.305
I cracked the case!

11:25.305 --> 11:26.646
(suspenseful music playing)

11:26.646 --> 11:28.148
Bernie...

11:28.148 --> 11:30.070
we need to talk.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.026
Is it you?

11:36.026 --> 11:37.117
Is it you?

11:37.117 --> 11:38.819
Is it you?

11:38.819 --> 11:42.662
Oh, yes,
it's me, Amelia!

11:42.662 --> 11:43.874
Amelia?

11:43.874 --> 11:45.325
Yes, from "Perfect Perfection"--

11:45.325 --> 11:46.917
We know who you are.

11:46.917 --> 11:48.128
What are you doing here?

11:48.128 --> 11:49.790
I'm undercover.

11:49.790 --> 11:52.212
You said your school
was full of smart kids,

11:52.212 --> 11:53.924
so I figured
I could research them

11:53.924 --> 11:55.335
to help me be
more of a role model.

11:55.335 --> 11:57.387
Okay, but if you want
to blend in,

11:57.387 --> 11:58.638
you might want to lose that.

12:02.552 --> 12:03.764
Goodbye, gorgeous.

12:05.185 --> 12:07.227
Anyway, we have
bigger problems.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.349
We're tracking down
Frankie's hater.

12:09.349 --> 12:11.021
You're right.
And as your friend,

12:11.021 --> 12:12.813
I'm committed
to helping you--

12:12.813 --> 12:14.064
Ooh, Science Club!

12:16.817 --> 12:18.819
Okay, back to the manhunt.

12:18.819 --> 12:20.200
How do we find a hater

12:20.200 --> 12:21.782
in a school full of people
who don't like us?

12:21.782 --> 12:22.993
I have an idea.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.627
Let's use one of our songs
to flush out the hater.

12:27.627 --> 12:30.080
Whoever has the most
negative reaction
is our suspect.

12:32.132 --> 12:34.084
♪ There's a... ♪

12:34.084 --> 12:35.675

12:38.218 --> 12:40.090
Okay, new plan.

12:40.090 --> 12:41.842
(loud typing)

12:41.842 --> 12:43.723
(dramatic music plays)

12:43.723 --> 12:44.885
Think it's that kid.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.191

12:54.154 --> 12:56.276
Hi, I'm Amel...

12:56.276 --> 12:57.157
Ameel.

12:57.157 --> 12:58.899
That makes sense
as a name.

12:58.899 --> 13:01.161
I'm a new student
and I was looking to meet

13:01.161 --> 13:02.993
other girls
who are into science.

13:02.993 --> 13:04.114
Science.

13:04.114 --> 13:05.575
That makes sense
as a word.

13:05.575 --> 13:07.537
Hi, Ameel.
I'm Celeste.

13:07.537 --> 13:08.909
I'm the Science Club president.

13:08.909 --> 13:10.961
We're making
a potassium iodide fountain.

13:10.961 --> 13:16.086
Hm, yes, the most sciencey
of all the fountains.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.468
Hey, since you're new,
you can have the honor

13:18.468 --> 13:21.341
of mixing the potassium iodide
and FD&C Green No. 3.

13:22.592 --> 13:24.014
No, that's okay.

13:24.014 --> 13:26.056
I mix potassium and...

13:26.056 --> 13:28.268
that other thing
all the time.

13:28.268 --> 13:29.229
I insist.

13:29.229 --> 13:31.231
And of course,
don't forget the PMR.

13:31.231 --> 13:32.812
Of course.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.895
The PMR.
The... pretty...

13:34.895 --> 13:36.606
-Precise...
-...makeup...

13:36.606 --> 13:39.109

13:39.109 --> 13:40.280
-ratio.
-...ratio!

13:40.280 --> 13:42.242
The PMR. Obviously.

13:43.653 --> 13:44.905
Be careful.

13:44.905 --> 13:47.577
If the mixture is even
a hair off, if forms a pigment

13:47.577 --> 13:49.709
that will stain your skin blue
for a week.

13:49.709 --> 13:52.332
You know, beach season
is coming up.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.875
Do you have anything
that would stain my skin bronze

13:54.875 --> 13:56.046
for a month?

13:57.547 --> 14:00.260
What, they don't have
beaches in science?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.558
All right, we gotta get this guy
to admit he's the hater.

14:08.558 --> 14:11.271
Thinkin' a good cop/bad cop
just like on TV.

14:11.271 --> 14:13.733
Love it.
I'll be bad cop.

14:13.733 --> 14:15.315
But you're too nice
to be bad cop.

14:15.315 --> 14:16.356
No, I'm not.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.777
What is this all about?

14:17.777 --> 14:20.320
I ask the questions
around here, Leon!

14:20.320 --> 14:23.073
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell.

14:23.073 --> 14:24.905
I'm a nice person.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.156
Do you want to see
your kids again?

14:26.156 --> 14:28.248
I don't have kids!
I'm 12!

14:29.539 --> 14:31.491
Well, if you don't tell me
what I wanna know,

14:31.491 --> 14:33.293
you're not gonna live
to see 11!

14:33.293 --> 14:35.916
I don't even know
what that means!

14:35.916 --> 14:38.919
So you want to do this
the hard way, huh, Leon?

14:38.919 --> 14:40.710
I have ways
of getting you to talk.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.132
No! My computer!

14:44.004 --> 14:45.465
(gasps)

14:45.465 --> 14:48.178
There are 25 more letters.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.971
Not to mention F1 through 12.

14:50.971 --> 14:52.272
Not the function keys!

14:52.272 --> 14:54.184
How will I ever easily
open the "Help" page

14:54.184 --> 14:56.476
of a working program?

14:56.476 --> 14:59.279
Guess you'll just
have to use the mouse

14:59.279 --> 15:00.780
like everybody else.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.733
All right, I'll talk!

15:07.367 --> 15:10.200
I feel like maybe
I did it a little wrong.

15:11.621 --> 15:13.203
It's okay.
Just make sure not to...

15:13.203 --> 15:15.125
-(Amelia gasps)
-touch your face.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.128
Is it bad?

15:21.251 --> 15:23.303
when I became president
of Science Club,

15:23.303 --> 15:25.385
I took an oath
to never lie.

15:25.385 --> 15:26.967
Girls...

15:26.967 --> 15:28.888
I resign as president
of Science Club.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.222
Aah! My face!

15:32.222 --> 15:34.224
It's one of my top
three features.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.436
Tied with my
incredible everything

15:36.436 --> 15:38.188
and my modesty.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.269
Don't panic.

15:39.269 --> 15:40.440
I have an idea.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.691
Sit.

15:45.405 --> 15:46.656
What are you doing?

15:46.656 --> 15:49.119
Neutralizing the blue tones
with an orange base.

15:49.119 --> 15:50.410
It's a trick I learned

15:50.410 --> 15:52.242
on "Perfect Perfection
with Amelia."

15:52.242 --> 15:53.373
(gasps)

15:53.373 --> 15:55.415
You watch PPWA?

15:55.415 --> 15:57.207
Of course.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.538
We're all Ameliacs.

15:58.538 --> 16:00.630
I mean, a girl
can be a scientist

16:00.630 --> 16:03.133
and have perfectly
glossed lips, right?

16:04.294 --> 16:05.795
I am a role model.

16:05.795 --> 16:08.218
Ladies, there's something
I need to show you.

16:09.549 --> 16:12.092
-(all scream)
-Yes, it's me!

16:12.092 --> 16:13.513
Amelia!

16:13.513 --> 16:15.395
It was the whole time.

16:15.395 --> 16:16.896
Mind-blowing, right?

16:16.896 --> 16:18.438
Yes.

16:18.438 --> 16:21.021
But also you just knocked over
some very noxious chemicals.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.652
And noxious means--

16:22.652 --> 16:23.653
Run!

16:29.319 --> 16:31.821
I will not leave
a perfectly good wig behind!

16:34.874 --> 16:36.996
Okay, no use hiding it.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.918
The reason I shut
my laptop so fast

16:38.918 --> 16:41.421
was because I was...
watching basketball.

16:41.421 --> 16:43.423
Ah-ha! Wait, what?

16:43.423 --> 16:44.624
Oh, please don't tell anyone.

16:44.624 --> 16:46.126
You know how kids
at this school look down

16:46.126 --> 16:48.388
on non-academic
recreational activities!

16:48.388 --> 16:49.589
This could get me kicked off

16:49.589 --> 16:52.302
-the Varsity Algebra team!
-(phone chimes)

16:52.302 --> 16:54.344
I'm not buying it.
He's the hater!

16:54.344 --> 16:55.895
He keeps posting comments.

16:55.895 --> 16:58.058
How can I?
My computer's over there.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.270
And all the keys
are right here.

17:01.641 --> 17:03.523
Oh, you're innocent, huh?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.484
Then how do you explain this?

17:05.484 --> 17:06.526
That's not me.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.946
Have you checked the metadata?

17:09.449 --> 17:11.570
Both:
Uh...

17:11.570 --> 17:13.363
What is this, preschool?

17:14.324 --> 17:16.415
The profile picture
was geo-tagged

17:16.415 --> 17:17.827
with a location
of where it was taken.

17:17.827 --> 17:19.618
523 Hartwick Street.

17:19.618 --> 17:20.750
Can I go now?

17:20.750 --> 17:22.252
I don't know,
can you?

17:23.463 --> 17:24.834
Yeah, I guess.

17:32.632 --> 17:33.763
Frankie...

17:33.763 --> 17:35.135
you have that look
in your eye.

17:35.135 --> 17:36.516
That look you get
when you're thinking

17:36.516 --> 17:37.977
of doing something
very stupid.

17:37.977 --> 17:39.309
Relax.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.350
There's nothing
to be worried about.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.772
I'm just gonna go
to this person's house

17:42.772 --> 17:45.525
and calmly explain
why their comments are hateful.

17:45.525 --> 17:48.528
If that doesn't work,
I'll just (mumbles).

17:48.528 --> 17:49.779
What was the last part?

17:49.779 --> 17:51.951
-Don't worry about it.
-Don't worry about it?

17:51.951 --> 17:54.364
You don't (mumbles)
something good.

17:55.455 --> 17:56.406
Frankie, no!

17:56.406 --> 17:59.329
I cannot let you go
to some random kid's house!

17:59.329 --> 18:03.253
You're either gonna get hurt,
get in trouble, or...

18:03.253 --> 18:05.545
tie me to a chair.

18:06.966 --> 18:08.508
Amelia! Oh, thank goodness!

18:08.508 --> 18:10.380
Paige, great news!

18:10.380 --> 18:12.592
I'm a role model!

18:12.592 --> 18:15.175
So how was your day?

18:15.175 --> 18:17.427
Oh, my day?
My day was pretty good.

18:17.427 --> 18:18.978
Thanks for--
untie me.

18:23.393 --> 18:24.934
♪ Hey! Hey! ♪

18:24.934 --> 18:26.526
Frankie, wait!

18:26.526 --> 18:27.857

18:29.649 --> 18:32.572
Wow, the school
is far from here.

18:33.693 --> 18:36.696
Do you have sports drink
or a banana or something?

18:38.328 --> 18:40.540
If you came here to stop me,
you're wasting your time.

18:40.540 --> 18:42.412
Being funny is the one thing

18:42.412 --> 18:43.833
I thought nobody could
take away from me,

18:43.833 --> 18:45.165
but this hater did.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.336
He has to pay.

18:46.336 --> 18:48.508
I get why you're upset,
but think about it.

18:48.508 --> 18:50.710
"Bizaardvark" is gonna
keep getting more popular,

18:50.710 --> 18:53.253
which means we're gonna get
more and more comments.

18:53.253 --> 18:54.884
What are you gonna do,
spend the rest of your life

18:54.884 --> 18:57.427
knocking on doors like
some kind of crazy hater police?

18:57.427 --> 19:00.019
Hater police.
What is that, like,

19:00.019 --> 19:01.561
cover me.

19:01.561 --> 19:03.763
Suspect has posted
three frowny faces

19:03.763 --> 19:05.435
followed by a poop emoji.

19:05.435 --> 19:06.526
Request backup.

19:06.526 --> 19:08.478
-(laughs)
-And emotional support!

19:10.860 --> 19:12.482
Wait, that sounded
like a real laugh.

19:12.482 --> 19:14.444
Of course it's a real laugh.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.535
You're funny.

19:15.535 --> 19:17.076
You never weren't funny.

19:17.076 --> 19:18.658
You just lost
your confidence.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.280
-So you're saying...
 -(reflective music plays)

19:20.280 --> 19:22.622
the truth was within me
the whole time,

19:22.622 --> 19:25.495
I just didn't know
where to look?

19:25.495 --> 19:26.746
It's a new character
I'm working on:

19:26.746 --> 19:28.998
"The Overly Dramatic
Lesson Learner."

19:28.998 --> 19:30.420
Let's get out of here.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.422
Ladies, heard you were here.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.884
-Bernie knew... somehow.
 -(suspenseful music plays)

19:36.216 --> 19:37.507
You told me.

19:37.507 --> 19:38.558
We'll see about that.

19:38.558 --> 19:40.510
Let's bring
this jerk to justice.

19:40.510 --> 19:41.721
No, Dirk.
You don't have to--

19:46.976 --> 19:48.107
Can I help you?

19:48.107 --> 19:49.649
Whoa, he's big.

19:49.649 --> 19:52.522
I heard you were talking smack
about my friends online.

19:52.522 --> 19:54.073
Not cool, bro.

19:54.073 --> 19:56.486
Not cool, bro!

19:56.486 --> 19:58.488
You got my back
if this goes down, right?

20:00.280 --> 20:02.081
What? I don't even--

20:02.081 --> 20:03.623
oh, no, not again.

20:03.623 --> 20:04.914
Eva, come here.

20:07.747 --> 20:09.419
Have you been using my laptop

20:09.419 --> 20:10.590
to post mean things
on the Internet?

20:11.631 --> 20:13.172
You know you're not
allowed to do that.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.504
Frankie:
Wait, you were the one

20:14.504 --> 20:16.546
who wrote all
those mean things about me?

20:16.546 --> 20:20.260
You cute little thing!

20:20.260 --> 20:22.141
She probably didn't even know
what she was saying.

20:22.141 --> 20:23.343
I did, actually.

20:23.343 --> 20:25.144
I was just using
your comment section

20:25.144 --> 20:26.976
as a forum
to passive aggressively

20:26.976 --> 20:28.978
vent out my own
inner frustrations

20:28.978 --> 20:30.980
even though they have
nothing to do with you.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.904
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to go make boom-boom.

20:36.856 --> 20:38.778
She's in the gifted program.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.411
Yo, man, you lifting?

20:41.411 --> 20:43.623
Mind if I get
my swole on with ya?

20:43.623 --> 20:45.325
-All right.
-Me too.

20:45.325 --> 20:47.917
What are you curlin'?
Fiddies? Hundos?

20:47.917 --> 20:49.168
Pass the iron, brah.

20:52.872 --> 20:54.464
Heh. You know what?

20:54.464 --> 20:56.506
I think Ill just do
some power pilates.

21:02.642 --> 21:05.385
What the heck just happened?

21:06.766 --> 21:07.727
Hey, guys!

21:07.727 --> 21:09.479
There's always gonna be
haters out there,

21:09.479 --> 21:11.230
but that doesn't mean
you should interrogate

21:11.230 --> 21:12.692
an innocent kid
for an hour.

21:12.692 --> 21:14.103
Long story. Heh.

21:14.103 --> 21:15.525
(whispers)
Sorry, Leon.

21:16.656 --> 21:18.358
The best thing is
just not to take

21:18.358 --> 21:19.819
what they take
too seriously.

21:19.819 --> 21:21.571
'Cause here's what happens
