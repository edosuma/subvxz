00:13.000 --> 00:15.875
[DJ on radio] Today, the State Department
announced the arrival of members

00:15.958 --> 00:19.875
of the provisional government of Penamstan
at Dulles International Airport.

00:19.958 --> 00:21.875
They are scheduled to meet
with the US Government

00:21.958 --> 00:24.708
to discuss future support
for their country. After that…

00:24.791 --> 00:27.291
[eerie music]

00:27.375 --> 00:29.291
[engine rumbles]

00:30.250 --> 00:32.791
[tires screech]

00:32.875 --> 00:35.875
President Graham has announced
that he'll be attending the ceremony,

00:35.958 --> 00:38.250
-to deliver a speech advocating peace.
-[engine whirs off]

00:39.958 --> 00:43.125
[car door opens, closes]

00:43.208 --> 00:46.583
[eerie music continues]

00:49.708 --> 00:51.791
[wood creaking]

00:57.791 --> 00:59.500
[insect buzzing]

01:06.750 --> 01:09.958
[ominous music]

01:15.083 --> 01:16.750
[objects clanging]

01:19.625 --> 01:20.708
[Leon] Jason?

01:21.375 --> 01:23.541
-Hey, Jason.
-[gasps, panting]

01:26.375 --> 01:27.625
You wanna talk about it?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
[theme music]

02:43.000 --> 02:45.416
[siren wails in distance]

02:48.000 --> 02:49.416
-[loud thud]
-[Claire exhales]

02:53.250 --> 02:56.041
[keyboard clacking]

02:56.125 --> 02:59.291
[Claire] As a result of the civil war
that broke out in 2000,

02:59.375 --> 03:03.166
Penamstan was more or less reduced
to a state of anarchy.

03:03.250 --> 03:07.875
Before the UN could pass a resolution,
the US deployed troops to the country.

03:07.958 --> 03:10.416
Penamstan militia resisted
what they thought was an invasion.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.458
[man 1] What we're doing to Penamstan
violates international law.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.791
I mean, what's the point
of the UN field survey?

03:15.875 --> 03:17.041
When the UN Security Council

03:17.125 --> 03:19.250
can't implement
effective measures promptly,

03:19.333 --> 03:22.541
military intervention is sanctioned
for humanitarian purposes.

03:22.625 --> 03:25.500
[man 1] "Humanitarian"? Anyone
in the world who can read a map

03:25.583 --> 03:28.041
knows exactly what the US is after.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.250
This isn't humanitarian aid.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.083
They're trying to gain
a foothold into China.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.250
[man 2] China has nothing to do with this.

03:35.333 --> 03:38.041
Look, if Penamstan wants to get out
from under their civil war

03:38.125 --> 03:40.125
and make the transition to a democracy,

03:40.208 --> 03:42.291
they're gonna need
a military force backing them up.

03:42.375 --> 03:46.416
But the provisional government
already started that process, remember?

03:46.500 --> 03:48.500
[man 1] It's obvious
we're picking a fight with them

03:48.583 --> 03:50.583
to trigger a new war.
If the US Government…

03:52.166 --> 03:54.083
[Claire] "A battle of futility."

03:55.833 --> 03:58.750
"Withdrawal leaves path of destruction."

03:58.833 --> 03:59.958
[key clacks]

04:00.041 --> 04:02.083
"Hero of Penamstan."

04:02.166 --> 04:05.291
[mysterious music]

04:06.208 --> 04:08.958
[footsteps]

04:09.041 --> 04:12.375
"Major General Wilson
greets the Mad Dogs unit

04:12.458 --> 04:15.541
on their return
from their mission in Penamstan."

04:19.833 --> 04:22.166
[clacking]

04:24.583 --> 04:25.916
[hums in wonder]

04:26.000 --> 04:29.166
[mysterious music continues]

04:37.791 --> 04:40.250
[photos rustling]

04:43.791 --> 04:45.125
[Claire exhales]

04:50.791 --> 04:52.791
All suicides…

04:54.125 --> 04:55.791
[hums in wonder]

04:55.875 --> 04:59.875
The only survivors are Jason
and one other person.

05:02.208 --> 05:03.708
[Claire sighs]

05:03.791 --> 05:06.000
[helicopter whirring]

05:06.083 --> 05:09.583
[operator] Command to Mad Dogs,
stand down and return to formation!

05:09.666 --> 05:11.666
[guns firing]

05:28.375 --> 05:29.375
-[MD 1] Clear!
-[Jason] Go!

05:33.083 --> 05:36.000
-[guns firing]
-[blood splatters]

05:36.666 --> 05:38.875
-[MD 2] Clear!
-[MD 3] Bastards took our guys!

05:38.958 --> 05:40.958
[focused breathing]

05:41.750 --> 05:44.916
-[men grunting]
-[helicopter whirring]

05:47.291 --> 05:48.750
-Fuck.
-[Jason] There's one here.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.250
[men grunting]

05:51.333 --> 05:53.416
US Army Mad Dogs, can you move?

05:55.458 --> 05:56.833
Oh, shit.

05:56.916 --> 06:00.041
-[tires screech]
-[man grunting]

06:00.791 --> 06:02.750
Okay. He's still alive.

06:02.833 --> 06:05.125
-[loud explosion]
-[men groaning]

06:08.333 --> 06:09.750
[grunting]

06:09.833 --> 06:12.833
[guns firing]

06:12.916 --> 06:14.833
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

06:14.916 --> 06:16.125
[gun reloading]

06:16.208 --> 06:19.375
Okay. We got this guy.
Cover us until we get to that building.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.791
Go!

06:20.875 --> 06:22.458
[tense music]

06:22.541 --> 06:24.291
-[gun firing]
-[grunting]

06:24.375 --> 06:26.041
-[grenade clangs]
-[man grunts]

06:26.125 --> 06:28.500
[loud explosion]

06:36.250 --> 06:38.416
-[loud explosions in distance]
-[fire crackles]

06:44.041 --> 06:46.708
[MD 4] Command. This is Mad Dogs.
We need evac for seven.

06:46.791 --> 06:48.708
We got one survivor,
and he's torn to shit.

06:48.791 --> 06:50.916
Hostiles inbound. Get us out of here.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.375
[comms beeping]

06:53.208 --> 06:54.166
Fuck!

06:55.375 --> 06:56.333
[groaning in pain]

06:56.416 --> 06:58.875
[MD 5] Let's light these bitches up
and get the fuck outta here.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.458
[MD 6] Sure. We're just gonna
walk back to base through that shit.

07:01.541 --> 07:02.750
You fucking high?

07:02.833 --> 07:04.750
All right. Goggles.

07:04.833 --> 07:07.166
[eerie music]

07:07.250 --> 07:08.666
[man grunts]

07:12.250 --> 07:13.458
[MD 1] Jesus Christ.

07:13.541 --> 07:16.375
-What the fuck were those things, man?
-[MD 2] How the fuck should I know?

07:16.458 --> 07:19.166
We need to get our asses
back to base and report this.

07:19.250 --> 07:22.208
We can't go back to base. It's not safe.

07:22.291 --> 07:25.541
Bullshit. They need to know
what's going on out here.

07:25.625 --> 07:28.000
The fuck's wrong with him?
Why ain't he dead?

07:28.083 --> 07:30.208
-We saw something we shouldn't have.
-[MD 3] We need to tell someone.

07:30.291 --> 07:32.250
People need to know
what happened back there.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.375
Tell them what? Who'd believe us?

07:34.458 --> 07:36.666
His unit must have been
on a top-secret mission.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.666
That's why they had to blast the site.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.875
[MD 3] They were dead.

07:39.958 --> 07:43.125
Those militia motherfuckers
dragged 'em out and killed 'em all.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.333
And they turned into that.

07:44.416 --> 07:46.166
Either way, we need to tell
somebody about it.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.708
Command dropped MK77s on the town.

07:47.791 --> 07:49.708
They wanted to burn everything,
including us.

07:49.791 --> 07:51.500
-If we talk, we're dead.
-[cloth rustles]

07:51.583 --> 07:53.083
-Shit.
-[guns clinking]

07:53.166 --> 07:54.208
Hold your fire!

07:57.000 --> 07:57.916
Who are you?

07:59.416 --> 08:03.208
Warrant Officer Fifth Class,
Shen May, sir.

08:03.291 --> 08:04.541
[Jason] What are you doing here?

08:05.583 --> 08:07.833
I was going over
your last transmissions and…

08:07.916 --> 08:10.000
[strange snarling]

08:10.083 --> 08:12.208
[flesh squelching]

08:15.875 --> 08:18.916
[strange snarling continues]

08:22.708 --> 08:25.958
[eerie music]

08:32.458 --> 08:34.166
-[clicks]
-[Shen May sighs]

08:36.500 --> 08:37.708
[Shen May] Jun See.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.583
[submarine whooshes]

08:58.833 --> 09:00.708
[water burbling]

09:02.083 --> 09:04.208
[crew 1] We're entering
Chinese waters, Captain.

09:04.291 --> 09:05.583
No trackers detected.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.625
[Captain] Good. Keep her steady.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.666
[strange squeaking]

09:15.000 --> 09:17.125
[ominous music]

09:21.833 --> 09:22.833
Have a seat.

09:28.708 --> 09:30.583
Looked like you were having a nightmare.

09:34.166 --> 09:37.083
They call me the hero of Penamstan.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.125
Some fucking hero.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.041
[exasperated sigh]

09:47.333 --> 09:49.041
[deep inhale]

09:49.125 --> 09:51.291
Every night, I have the same nightmare.

09:53.583 --> 09:55.250
About Penamstan.

09:55.958 --> 09:57.125
That day.

09:57.666 --> 09:59.958
[troubled breathing]

10:00.041 --> 10:01.583
[Jason] Penamstan.

10:04.041 --> 10:05.250
That was hell.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.208
Yeah.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.291
I bet.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.541
You have no idea.

10:15.666 --> 10:19.458
Look. I can't imagine
what it was like for you.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.583
But I have been through some shit myself.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.750
Raccoon City.

10:28.208 --> 10:29.958
They sterilized that place.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.416
[dramatic music]

10:32.500 --> 10:34.666
-You were there?
-Yeah.

10:35.416 --> 10:36.416
[sighs]

10:36.500 --> 10:39.125
I was just a rookie cop
late as hell on his first day.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.250
That's why I'm still alive.

10:45.666 --> 10:47.333
[Leon] There were zombies everywhere.

10:48.791 --> 10:52.458
I remember… people screaming.

10:53.708 --> 10:54.875
Moaning.

10:57.416 --> 10:59.125
They'd get bit, and then they'd turn.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.458
It was terrifying.

11:03.833 --> 11:06.166
[dramatic music continues]

11:06.250 --> 11:08.041
There's no way to describe it except…

11:09.125 --> 11:10.583
Hell.

11:12.416 --> 11:13.583
Yeah.

11:16.375 --> 11:19.250
The government wiped the city
off the map and covered it all up.

11:19.333 --> 11:22.708
Sure. They didn't want it to spread.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.875
You destroy a city to save the country.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.375
That's a tough call,
but someone's gotta make it.

11:30.916 --> 11:35.250
There were people alive in there.
There were families alive in there.

11:35.333 --> 11:38.500
And they didn't even try to get them out.
So, tough call my ass!

11:38.583 --> 11:41.666
Look, I get it. You were a cop.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.541
[Jason] It was your job
to protect those people

11:43.625 --> 11:45.000
and you want justice for them.

11:45.791 --> 11:50.166
But agents like us, we don't get
to think that way anymore.

11:50.250 --> 11:53.375
It's a new world
and we just gotta roll with it.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.083
You cannot save a country,

11:55.166 --> 11:57.541
if you don't give a damn
about the people in it.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.333
[scoffs]

12:02.083 --> 12:05.291
Before, you said "terrifying".

12:07.875 --> 12:10.833
[Jason] Do you know where the root
of terror comes from?

12:10.916 --> 12:11.916
I don't follow.

12:13.791 --> 12:15.458
It starts with fear.

12:19.250 --> 12:20.208
[Jason] Yeah.

12:22.583 --> 12:23.500
Humans.

12:24.958 --> 12:26.875
Humans fear the unknown.

12:27.750 --> 12:31.250
And there is nothing
more unknowable than us.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.250
As a species…

12:34.375 --> 12:37.291
oh, we're unpredictable. We're cruel.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.583
Especially when we're trying to survive.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.666
[grunts]

12:44.500 --> 12:47.500
Yeah. The Greeks said it best.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.833
"There is much to fear in this world…

12:53.083 --> 12:55.333
but nothing more so than humans."

12:56.125 --> 12:58.208
-[loud clonk]
-[both groaning]

12:58.291 --> 12:59.791
What the fuck was that?

13:07.083 --> 13:09.458
[rapid breathing]

13:11.083 --> 13:14.125
[machine beeping]

13:23.416 --> 13:25.041
[Leon] Hey. You all right?

13:25.750 --> 13:26.833
[flesh squelches]

13:26.916 --> 13:30.041
[grim music]

13:31.208 --> 13:32.458
Shit.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.500
[grim music continues]

13:45.666 --> 13:49.291
[Jason] Hey. We're in a pressurized tube
underwater. Remember?

13:51.416 --> 13:52.625
[swishes]

14:26.208 --> 14:29.125
-[flesh squelching]
-[munching]

14:32.708 --> 14:35.416
I can't get the engine room
on the horn. What's going on?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.750
The sub might be infected
by an unknown virus.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.541
We need to isolate it. Shut all the doors.

14:40.625 --> 14:42.625
-But the air will still--
-It's a temporary measure.

14:42.708 --> 14:45.333
-Hurry up and shut the door.
-[crew 2] Prepare for lockdown.

14:45.416 --> 14:47.708
-[crew 3] Which compartment's infected?
-Near the bow.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.791
-Lock it down.
-[door clangs]

14:50.833 --> 14:51.916
[grunts]

14:52.000 --> 14:53.250
[crew 2] Hatch secure.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.250

[flesh crunching intensifies]

16:16.666 --> 16:18.375
-[blood splatters]
-Jesus.

16:18.458 --> 16:19.500
[rat snarls]

16:19.583 --> 16:24.916
-[sniffing, screeches]
-[Leon] You gotta be shitting me.

This submarine

16:55.125 --> 16:59.166
All crew, board the ASDS2 and evacuate.

16:59.250 --> 17:02.916
Commencing countdown.
Five minutes to self-destruct.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.458

I'm not a rat.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.333
Fifty-one…

18:45.416 --> 18:47.041
[Leon] You wanna get that out of my face?

18:48.375 --> 18:49.833
You'll kill us all.

18:51.958 --> 18:53.500
Am I interrupting something here?

19:12.125 --> 19:14.291
[Wilson] We received
their SOS an hour ago.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.666
We haven't picked up any signal
on the radar since then.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.291
It's vanished.

19:19.375 --> 19:23.083
Also, we spotted a Chinese fleet
near their last ping.

19:23.166 --> 19:24.208
[Ryan sighs]

19:24.291 --> 19:25.708
That's the last thing we needed.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.708
I'm going to raise the DEFCON level.

20:44.666 --> 20:48.166
[Leon] All right, we made it to shore.
You wanna brief us?

20:51.916 --> 20:54.541
You can start by telling me
what you're really after.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.208
I mean, you killed the crew.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.208
Must be a major op, right?

21:03.916 --> 21:08.125
If you're not gonna break
into the facility, what are you here for?

21:09.625 --> 21:12.166
Shen May and I are on a different mission.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.166
We're looking for something else.

21:16.916 --> 21:17.958
[Leon] What?

21:19.791 --> 21:23.083
Proof that will expose a conspiracy
by the US Government.

21:29.083 --> 21:32.666
[scoffs]
Treason. Fun.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.708
I'll be sure to put that in my report.

21:38.041 --> 21:41.041
[tense music]

21:48.333 --> 21:49.833
[Jason scoffs]

21:53.875 --> 21:55.291
[Jason] It won't do you any good.

21:55.375 --> 21:58.250
They'll just cover it up,
like they always do.

21:59.375 --> 22:02.083
And you know how good they are
at covering things up.

22:03.208 --> 22:05.625
They're the bad guys here.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.583
Where's your proof?

22:10.250 --> 22:11.625
[Jason] That's what we're here for.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.375
And you're going to help us get it.

22:15.416 --> 22:16.791
You want my help?

22:18.125 --> 22:20.208
You just killed a sub full of people.

22:20.291 --> 22:23.583
[tense music continues]

22:24.375 --> 22:25.708
[tensed inhale]

22:25.791 --> 22:28.041
[Jason] Remember when I
told you about terror?

22:30.291 --> 22:32.083
It starts with fear.

22:33.166 --> 22:37.708
You cultivate it, and you
watch it spread, and then…

22:39.416 --> 22:41.041
then you've got terror.

22:41.958 --> 22:43.291
[scoffs]

22:43.375 --> 22:46.958
You can tell them all about it
at your court-martial.

22:48.666 --> 22:50.083
So you're not gonna help us, then?

22:52.625 --> 22:54.333
[exhales]

22:55.500 --> 22:56.333
Nope.
