17:40.159 --> 17:41.617
So we're clear now.

17:41.784 --> 17:43.875
'Cause I don't want to
have to say it again.

17:53.794 --> 17:55.137
Sue.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.949
Well, that came out of nowhere.

18:22.978 --> 18:25.004
<i>We had high hopes</i>
<i>Brick's visit with Dr. Fulton</i>

18:25.107 --> 18:26.422

<i>and we'd find him</i>

18:26.509 --> 18:28.551
<i>sleeping peacefully in bed.</i>

18:28.878 --> 18:31.674
<i>But the higher the hopes,</i>
<i>the farther the fall.</i>

18:34.262 --> 18:36.115
Check under the table.

18:39.083 --> 18:42.070
[ Keyboard clacking ]

18:43.589 --> 18:44.959
What's going on, Brick?

18:45.092 --> 18:46.491
I thought you were gonna
sleep in your bed.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.491
Oh, hey.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.774
Actually, I was asleep in bed,
and then I woke up

18:49.876 --> 18:52.397
and started to worry about
the Asian stock market.

18:52.484 --> 18:53.917
It opens early, you know.

18:54.037 --> 18:54.955
Of course.

18:55.041 --> 18:56.640
Well, I started to feel
a little anxious,

18:56.729 --> 18:58.282
so, taking Dr. Fulton's advice,

18:58.378 --> 19:00.211
I came out here
to do some jumping jacks,

19:00.307 --> 19:02.904
and while I got
the jumping part right,

19:03.002 --> 19:05.784
when it came to the jacks, my
coordination was a little off,

19:05.887 --> 19:07.604
and I bumped into
the fireplace,

19:07.701 --> 19:10.953
and mom's royal baby goblet
fell and broke.

19:11.094 --> 19:12.202
- Brick.
- That's okay.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.102
I wanted to fix it,

19:13.220 --> 19:15.130
so I Googled
"Gluing a broken goblet,"

19:15.229 --> 19:16.767
and it took me to
this interesting web page

19:16.856 --> 19:18.009
about Buddhism.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.715
It said a person should imagine

19:19.822 --> 19:21.639
the things they love
broken and destroyed

19:21.736 --> 19:22.579
because in the future,

19:22.704 --> 19:24.941
everything ends up
that way anyway.

19:25.361 --> 19:26.496
Okay.

19:26.594 --> 19:28.055
So, I imagined
the house burned down

19:28.182 --> 19:30.447
and you and Sue and Axl
all dead

19:30.543 --> 19:31.428
and all my books gone

19:31.514 --> 19:32.968
and I had no one left
in the world,

19:33.099 --> 19:35.322
and it started to make me
feel better.

19:35.434 --> 19:36.475
It did?

19:36.570 --> 19:38.924
Yeah. Suddenly,
things made sense.

19:39.063 --> 19:40.759
It's like
this Buddhist guy says.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.149
"You see this goblet?

19:42.295 --> 19:44.295
For me, it is already broken.

19:44.413 --> 19:45.403
I enjoy it.

19:45.497 --> 19:46.664
I drink out of it.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.978
But when I put this glass
on the shelf

19:49.078 --> 19:51.074
and the wind knocks it over
and it shatters,

19:51.171 --> 19:52.729
I say, 'Of course.'

19:52.862 --> 19:55.358
When I understand that
the glass is already broken,

19:55.475 --> 19:58.053
every moment with it
is precious."

19:58.618 --> 20:00.023
So I've decided, from now on,

20:00.137 --> 20:01.540
I want to spend
every moment I can

20:01.634 --> 20:03.409
with the things I cherish most.

20:04.827 --> 20:06.507
So, I'll be in my room
with my books.

20:06.602 --> 20:07.879
Try not to bother me.

20:09.239 --> 20:11.342

20:11.471 --> 20:14.784

<i>so we were happy.</i>

20:14.927 --> 20:17.425
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>it didn't quite work for Axl.</i>

20:17.540 --> 20:18.722
It's a different way
of looking at it.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.983
Imagine the store
not opening on Saturday.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.036
See? The worst outcome
has already happened.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.219
Now, don't you feel better?

20:24.514 --> 20:25.603
You're fired.

20:26.245 --> 20:29.313
Well, I already imagined that,
so I'm not upset.

Look.

20:41.335 --> 20:43.202
I know you think me kissing you
four times was--

20:43.287 --> 20:44.575
Five times.

20:44.673 --> 20:46.687
Yeah, well,
don't worry about it,

20:46.837 --> 20:48.831
'cause I'm not gonna
kiss you again.

20:49.978 --> 20:51.605
Good, 'cause it's gross

20:51.739 --> 20:54.909

at night while I fall asleep.

20:55.027 --> 20:56.599
Look, I've been
thinking about this.

20:56.711 --> 20:59.457
I'm used to just taking
what I want when I want it.

20:59.595 --> 21:00.772
Uh-huh.

21:00.858 --> 21:05.121
Thing is, I know I'm not
worthy of you yet.

21:05.327 --> 21:06.734
I will be someday.

21:06.856 --> 21:08.336
I want to make something
of myself--

I'm gonna kiss you so hard,
