and fill my club
with punters?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.915
Do you get me?

13:48.915 --> 13:52.092
Oh, and none
of your usual attitude.

13:52.092 --> 13:55.878
Yes... boss.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.533
-Oh...
-[door opens]

13:58.533 --> 14:01.188
can zombies swim?

14:01.188 --> 14:03.190
[door closes]

14:03.190 --> 14:05.018
[moaning and snarling]

14:43.099 --> 14:45.014
-What are you doing?
-Oh.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.625
Standing there
just lurking.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.454
Hi, Ellie, um, well,
I was just wondering if--

14:50.454 --> 14:52.108
well, if you wanted
to come out

14:52.108 --> 14:53.718
to the town with me
and the boys tonight.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.895
And why would I want
to do that?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.722
I think I'’ll just stay here
and wait for James

14:57.722 --> 14:59.811
to tag the pictures
on Facebook.

14:59.811 --> 15:04.729
It'’s not gonna be like that.
And... we wereon a break.

15:04.729 --> 15:07.123
Look, Alex,
I don'’t care what you do.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.951
You said I was boring.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.127
Then the next thing I know,
a picture of you

15:11.127 --> 15:13.260
and some random
pops up online.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.740
How do you think
that made me feel, Alex?

15:15.740 --> 15:17.742
I'’m not going through
that again.

15:17.742 --> 15:21.007
Well, it-- it was Big Jim
who said you were boring--

15:21.007 --> 15:22.965
And it was Jim who took
the photo, I know that,

15:22.965 --> 15:24.793
but it wasn'’t Jim
with his tongue

15:24.793 --> 15:26.229
down some girl'’s throat,
was it?

15:26.229 --> 15:28.101
Well, obviously.
Like that would ever happen.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.580
[laughs]

15:29.580 --> 15:34.324
Well, I thought that maybe
that you came to Ibiza

15:34.324 --> 15:36.065
t-to maybe, you know,
get back together.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.937
I came because you
were too tight

15:37.937 --> 15:40.243
to change the name
on the ticket.

15:40.243 --> 15:44.639
Look, you can go and be exciting
with your stupid mates,

15:44.639 --> 15:47.381
but I'’m staying here
and being boring.

15:55.911 --> 15:59.175
Jim, you said there'’d
be wireless here.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.829
What are you
on the Internet for?

16:00.829 --> 16:02.613
You can see lovely tits
if you just look outside.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.094
I just wanna know
what'’s going on back home.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.183
What if there'’s
been another attack?

16:07.183 --> 16:08.837
For all we know,
England could be

16:08.837 --> 16:10.534
completely overrun
by the plague.

16:10.534 --> 16:13.581
Mate, we'’ve been away
for like three hours.

16:13.581 --> 16:16.323
-Besides, you wanna
hope it doeskick off.
-Uh, why?

16:16.323 --> 16:19.587
"Uh," because then
we'’d be stuck here on,

16:19.587 --> 16:22.851
like, the ultimate party island
with those dirty bitches

16:22.851 --> 16:24.853
tasked with restarting
the human race.

16:24.853 --> 16:28.248
They'’d be obligated to shag us
which, for a guy like you,

16:28.248 --> 16:30.076
is pretty much the only
chance you'’ve ever got

16:30.076 --> 16:33.862
of seeing any action
with your little raisin dick.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.472
[groans]

16:35.472 --> 16:37.213
Don'’t wanna know.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.954
He'’s having imaginary sex

16:38.954 --> 16:40.912
with one
of the girls outside.

16:40.912 --> 16:43.393
-It'’s probably your sister.
-I said I don'’t wanna know.

16:43.393 --> 16:46.440
-It isyour sister, mate.
-At least it'’s not Ellie.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.355
It'’s not gonna be her,
is it?

16:48.355 --> 16:50.052
Do you know what, mate,
I don'’t think we'’ve given you

16:50.052 --> 16:51.749
nearly enough shit for inviting
your ex-girlfriend

16:51.749 --> 16:53.055
on our lads holiday.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.188
She wasn'’t my ex
when I invited her.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.755
Even worse!
You'’re just lucky me and Az

16:57.755 --> 17:00.062
are even talking to you after
pulling a stunt like that.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.325
Did you temporarily
lose your mind or something?

17:02.325 --> 17:06.155
Well, I-- I thought it might be
a good idea

17:06.155 --> 17:09.028
to combine a lads holiday with--
with a romantic holiday.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.420
Are you fucking nuts?

17:10.420 --> 17:12.161
Have you literally gone
full retard?

17:12.161 --> 17:14.032
Can you even understand
the words that come out

17:14.032 --> 17:15.946
of your mouth when you say them?
You'’re ridiculous.

17:15.946 --> 17:18.298
It'’s not like you two know what
it'’s like to have a girlfriend.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.907
That'’s because
I'’m a player, Alex,

17:19.907 --> 17:21.518
and I don'’t like
to get tied down

17:21.518 --> 17:23.128
to just one bitch,
you know that.

17:23.128 --> 17:26.001
-Yeah, me too.
-What?

17:26.001 --> 17:29.396
-What are you doing, anyway?
-Exercising, obviously.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.137
It'’s always good
to get pumping

17:31.137 --> 17:33.052
before you got out
to get some bitch to pump.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.749
You always look bigger as well

17:34.749 --> 17:36.881
when you'’re just fresh
from working out.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.709
-Sure you wanna look
any bigger, Jim?
-Fuck off, mate.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.103
This is all muscle.
Az, get on.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.191
All right.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.194
[sighs]

17:47.109 --> 17:48.806
[bellows]

17:48.806 --> 17:50.504
[crack]

17:50.504 --> 17:52.332
[groans]

17:52.332 --> 17:54.334
Fucking idiots.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.292
You only need one
of the big ones anyway.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.164
Any more than that and it'’s
actually counterproductive

17:58.164 --> 17:59.600
and you'’re gonna lose
muscle density.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.169
Whatever man.
Look, boys.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.823
I say we get out of here
as quick as possible,

18:05.823 --> 18:08.348
go to some bars,
hit some clubs,

18:08.348 --> 18:10.567
and just get absolutely
fucking wankered.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.788
Fuckin'’ A, first decent thing
you'’ve said since we got here.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.619
Az, hurry up, man.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.494
[groans weakly]

18:24.494 --> 18:25.626
Lads?

18:29.543 --> 18:34.461
Hi, girls, so,
uh, me and Alex here

18:34.461 --> 18:37.768
were just off to
the local nightclubs

18:37.768 --> 18:39.944
to harvest them
for all the pussy

18:39.944 --> 18:42.121
they can yield,
so don'’t wait up, ladies.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.340
James, I don'’t give
a rat'’s ass what you do,

18:44.340 --> 18:46.647
I just want Alex back
in one piece, all right?

18:46.647 --> 18:50.825
So that means no drugs,
and if by some insane miracle

18:50.825 --> 18:53.088
that you happen to pull a bird,
just be careful,

18:53.088 --> 18:55.308
-if you know what I mean.
-No, it'’s not gonna--

18:55.308 --> 18:57.223
I got this, mate,
I got this.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.486
You-- you don'’t need to worry
your pretty little head

18:59.486 --> 19:02.924
about that, Liz, because
I actually happen to have

19:02.924 --> 19:05.796
knob protection
in every flavor of the rainbow.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.407
So you needn'’t worry,

19:07.407 --> 19:09.800
I got your five a day
right here, you know?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.890
I'’d actually rather rub sand
up my vagina.

19:12.890 --> 19:15.545
Interesting you should say
that, Zara, because so would I.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.939
So would I.
Anyway, we'’re off.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.941
See you later, bitches.
Let'’s roll.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.986
Az, you ready?

19:21.986 --> 19:23.727
We'’re gonna go without you
if you'’re not careful.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.381
Get a move on and you better not
be wanking again,

19:25.381 --> 19:26.774
you disgusting little man!

19:28.819 --> 19:31.431
Thanks for letting me
stay in with you tonight.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.563
It'’s really good
to get out here and relax.

19:33.563 --> 19:37.088
[laughs] Sweetheart,
I'’ve been relaxing all day.

19:37.088 --> 19:40.527
We'’re going out and partying
very hard tonight.

19:40.527 --> 19:43.443
I thought you said we were
having a girlie night in?

19:43.443 --> 19:46.054
No, I just said that to Alex
and his dickhead mates

19:46.054 --> 19:47.838
so they didn'’t tag along.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.666
No, tonight we'’re gonna go out,
and we'’re gonna get

19:49.666 --> 19:52.365
-absolutely shit faced.
-Oh, yeah.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.540
Oh.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.150
-Yep.
-[giggles]

19:56.934 --> 19:58.545
[thumping electronic music]

20:06.509 --> 20:08.555
What?

20:08.555 --> 20:10.687
I'’m-- I'’m not used
to this sun, all right?

20:10.687 --> 20:12.298
Az...

20:12.298 --> 20:15.039
it'’s nearly dark,
and we'’re inside.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.825
So? I'’d rather
be safe than sorry.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.654
You look like you'’re in one
of them bukkake videos, mate.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.569
You literally look
like 12 German blokes

20:22.569 --> 20:25.136
split the cost of a room
in a youth hostel

20:25.136 --> 20:27.530
just to jizz all over
your disgusting little body.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.880
It'’s filthy.
And you smell like piña colada.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.796
[grunts] It smells better
than this tastes, though.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.885
Tastes like piss.
Diseased piss.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.583
You'’d know what
diseased piss tastes like.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.411
I expect you'’ve sucked off
enough diseased penises

20:38.411 --> 20:39.673
to last you a lifetime, Alex.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.544
This is a little
invention of mine

20:41.544 --> 20:44.547
I got the barman to mix up--
I call it the Big Jim, baby!

20:44.547 --> 20:46.767
Inventive Jim.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.725
So it isyour piss, then?

20:48.725 --> 20:51.511
Yeah, yeah, there'’s a bit
of my spunk in there as well.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.252
Anyway,
you need to drink up boys.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.557
We need to be nice and toasted

20:54.557 --> 20:56.124
for when we get
into them super clubs.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.648
Jim, have you seen
the price of these clubs?

20:58.648 --> 21:00.868
It'’s like 60 Euros
just to get in.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.609
[Jim] You'’re the tightest man
I'’ve ever met.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.350
You'’re tighter
than your ex'’s vagina

21:04.350 --> 21:05.829
and there'’s nothing
that'’s ever been up that.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.267
-[Alex] I'’m not tight, okay?
-Hi.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.617
She is-- but-- I don'’t--

21:10.617 --> 21:12.880
-will you stop talking about
Ellie, all right?
-Hi!

21:12.880 --> 21:16.144
You'’re the one who'’s always
going on about her-- oh, hello.

21:16.144 --> 21:19.756
Looking for somewhere
to party tonight?

21:19.756 --> 21:21.671
Can you recommend
anywhere at all?

21:21.671 --> 21:24.021
Yeah, I can.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.154
I'’m the fucking promo girl!

21:26.154 --> 21:29.723
Or do you think I choose
to wear this fucking T-shirt?!

21:31.681 --> 21:34.728
Don'’t need to be so rude.

21:34.728 --> 21:37.600
I think I'’m in love.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.472
I think you'’re
in dream world.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.996
I think we found
tonight'’s destination.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.867
[upbeat electronic music]

22:01.363 --> 22:04.714
I just--
I just wish it was vampires.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.368
Vampires?

22:06.368 --> 22:08.675
You'’re so fucking random,
Zara.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.982
Vampires are just,
you know, sexier.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.855
If it was vampires,
I'’d be out there right now

22:14.855 --> 22:16.378
with some pale Twilight dude

22:16.378 --> 22:19.686
sticking his fangs
right into me.

22:19.686 --> 22:23.516
Instead... zombies.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.169
They'’re fucking disgusting.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.432
Yeah.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.608
Iwouldn'’t wanna be one,

22:28.608 --> 22:30.653
and I sure as hell
wouldn'’t want to fuck one.

22:30.653 --> 22:34.309
[Liz laughs] Well, at least
you do have somestandards.

22:34.309 --> 22:37.704
Babe, you know I'’m not
some sort of mega slut.

22:39.488 --> 22:40.663
Hola.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.317
-Hola.
-Ooh, la, la.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.802
So, um, Ellie.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.370
First night in Ibiza.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.677
-Anything tickle your fancy?
-[chuckles] No, I don'’t--

22:54.677 --> 22:56.592
Nonsense.

22:56.592 --> 23:00.204
You do with some hot lovin'’
to get you over, you know...

23:00.204 --> 23:03.033
what'’s-his-name,
uh, Liz'’s brother.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.426
No, really, I'’m fine.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.473
Bollocks on you.
Wait here.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.302
Where--
where is she going?

23:11.302 --> 23:13.087
I really don'’t know.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.871
She'’s a force of nature,
that one.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.961
If her pussy had a password,
it'’d be "password."

23:17.961 --> 23:19.833
[both laugh]

23:19.833 --> 23:21.878
Thanks for letting me
hang out with you girls.

23:21.878 --> 23:24.141
Mm, no worries,
no worries.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.274
Look, I don'’t have
a clue what happened with you

23:26.274 --> 23:28.102
and my dickhead little brother,
and to be honest,

23:28.102 --> 23:30.974
I don'’t care as long
as we have a good time, Yeah?

23:30.974 --> 23:32.062
-Yeah.
-Good.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.412
[Zara] Ladies?

23:33.412 --> 23:37.328
the party
has officially begun.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.505
-30 seconds?
-That definitely beats

23:39.505 --> 23:42.203
-your personal best, Zara.
-[laughs] Babe!

23:42.203 --> 23:45.511
Um, Liz, Ellie darling?

23:45.511 --> 23:48.514
Meet...
thingie and thingie.

23:48.514 --> 23:52.387
Hey, hi, I'’m Rupert.
This is my good friend Todd.

23:52.387 --> 23:54.389
You'’ll have to excuse
him, he'’s American.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.218
Yeah, bro, I'’m having the best
night of my fucking life.

23:57.218 --> 23:59.089
-Yeah.
-Get krunked up, baby!

23:59.089 --> 24:01.788
Oh, yeah. [laughs]

24:01.788 --> 24:04.138
I don'’t suppose you girls
fancy moving on, do you?

24:04.138 --> 24:06.488
I know this cracking spot
to watch the sunset.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.360
-Oh, really?
-Mmm.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.276
[thumping dance music]

24:12.276 --> 24:13.626
[camera clicks]

24:18.369 --> 24:20.154
[snarling]

24:26.160 --> 24:29.511
You boys
know how to read?

24:29.511 --> 24:31.078
No fucking photos.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.126
Hello.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.999
I'’m, uh, Karl.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.262
Owner of the establishment.

24:41.262 --> 24:44.047
So is this-- is she--
is that a real zombie?

24:44.047 --> 24:47.486
[Karl]
Oh, she'’s real all right.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.226
Worked for me for years.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.533
Only now
I don'’t have to pay her.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.710
But I thought that the island
was clear from infection?

24:54.710 --> 24:58.235
Well, you shouldn'’t believe
everything you read, cupcake.

24:58.235 --> 25:00.629
On this island,
for the right price,

25:00.629 --> 25:02.936
everything'’s available.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.286
So what happens if you
feed '’em alcohol, then?

25:05.286 --> 25:07.723
Oh, no, no, no. No.

25:07.723 --> 25:11.466
No, we tend to ah, pump
our dancers full of MDMA.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.989
Keeps them chilled.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.817
Means they'’re less
likely to bite.

25:14.817 --> 25:19.779
Booze on the other hand--
bad vibes.

25:19.779 --> 25:23.043
Gunter, why don'’t
we show these boys

25:23.043 --> 25:25.393
how we motivate our dancers?

25:25.393 --> 25:28.614
[German accent]
Yes, boss. My pleasure.

25:28.614 --> 25:32.443
[prod buzzes, Gunter laughs]

25:35.795 --> 25:37.753
[prod buzzes, zombie growls]

25:37.753 --> 25:39.973
It'’s all in the timing.
Look.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.583
[prod buzzes, zombie hisses]

25:41.583 --> 25:43.019
Yes, quite.

25:43.019 --> 25:45.456
Well, who'’s for a--
a proper drink?

25:45.456 --> 25:48.329
Hmm? You? Yes.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.073
Piña coladas, maybe?

25:58.861 --> 26:00.428
[growls]

26:02.430 --> 26:04.084
Pretty romantic, eh?

26:04.084 --> 26:08.697
Um... yeah, I suppose so.

26:08.697 --> 26:12.571
Champagne,
a beautiful sunset,

26:12.571 --> 26:14.660
and an even more
beautiful girl.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.313
-[coughs]
-What more can a guy ask for--

26:16.313 --> 26:18.185
-you okay?
-Yeah.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.230
I'’m fine.

26:20.230 --> 26:24.931
I'’m just not used to
all of this.

26:24.931 --> 26:27.237
But it'’s something you could
get used to, right?

26:27.237 --> 26:29.022
Yeah, maybe.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.589
Fast going, Ellie.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.373
Listen,
keep your knickers on.

26:32.373 --> 26:36.464
we'’re going to the pool party
back our the house.

26:36.464 --> 26:39.206
[Todd]
Woo-hoo! Pool party!

27:39.658 --> 27:41.355
[distorted music]

27:50.190 --> 27:51.408
[faint scream]

28:05.422 --> 28:06.685
[groans]

28:10.645 --> 28:12.647
Are you all right, mate?

28:12.647 --> 28:14.127
Yeah.

28:14.127 --> 28:17.260
But it-- it'’s too loud.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.393
You know,
I'’m gonna go ask the DJ

28:19.393 --> 28:21.569
if he'’ll play
a bit of Morrissey.

28:21.569 --> 28:25.007
You know, with some real--
oh, what'’s it named?

28:25.007 --> 28:26.182
Lyrics!

28:29.403 --> 28:31.231
It'’s that Karl bloke, mate.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.450
He'’s be giving him free drinks
all night.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.626
You don'’t reckon
he spiked '’em, do ya?

28:35.626 --> 28:38.368
Or put a date rape
in his drink?

28:38.368 --> 28:41.284
Do you reckon he'’s put
a date rape in all our drinks?

28:41.284 --> 28:43.069
Probably, that'’s why I'’ve
been giving all my drinks

28:43.069 --> 28:46.159
-to that zombie over there.
-Are you fucking mad?

28:46.159 --> 28:48.204
Did you not hear
what the owner said?

28:48.204 --> 28:50.816
I don'’t give a shit.
I wanna see what happens.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.731
Anyway,
never mind that undead slut.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.125
You see who'’s over there?
It'’s that bird from earlier.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.693
She'’s definitely
getting down downstairs

28:58.693 --> 29:00.869
thinking a meet with Big Jim,
do you know what I'’m saying?

29:00.869 --> 29:03.524
Jim, it'’s her job
to flirt with guys

29:03.524 --> 29:05.221
to get '’em into the club,

29:05.221 --> 29:06.962
and she didn'’t even
bother with us.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.747
Do you know what?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.487
I'’m gonna be the
bigger man here, yeah?

29:10.487 --> 29:12.359
You'’re the one
who'’s pining for his ex.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.056
So why don'’t you go over there
and give it a go?

29:14.056 --> 29:16.842
Oh, well,
that'’s really generous of you.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.279
Speaking of your ex,
she was looking pretty smoking

29:19.279 --> 29:21.020
in that bikini of hers today.

29:21.020 --> 29:24.110
Don'’t talk about Ellie
like that, all right?

29:24.110 --> 29:26.068
It'’s bad enough
you perv on my sister.

29:26.068 --> 29:29.332
Look, mate, if me and your
sister doend up gettin'’ it on,

29:29.332 --> 29:31.378
which is entirely possible
given the way

29:31.378 --> 29:33.902
she'’s been looking at me,
that'’s nature taking its course.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.164
You can'’t hate on
a player for that.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.732
In the meantime,
you need to get yourself

29:37.732 --> 29:40.517
back on the minge horse,
get balls deep in some sluts.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.606
Starting
with that one over there.

29:42.606 --> 29:45.348
I don'’t want sluts!

29:45.348 --> 29:46.741
Sorry.

29:46.741 --> 29:48.134
I just want Ellie.

29:48.134 --> 29:51.354
I want sluts.

29:51.354 --> 29:52.355
What, you?

29:54.009 --> 29:55.489
You and her?

29:55.489 --> 29:57.099
Yeah, why not?

29:57.099 --> 29:59.406
Go on mate, be my guest.
This'’ll be hilarious.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.585
[chuckles]

30:04.585 --> 30:05.978
Bastard!

30:05.978 --> 30:07.980
[laughs]

30:07.980 --> 30:09.633
Great stuff.

30:09.633 --> 30:14.247
Now, Maria,
don'’t insult the customers.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.510
You know what, Karl?

30:16.510 --> 30:19.861
You can stick your
shitty job into your ass! Huh?

30:19.861 --> 30:22.777
You are not turning me into
one of your fucking zombies.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.433
[grunts angrily]

30:36.312 --> 30:38.358
Crazy woman.

30:38.358 --> 30:40.708
I have absolutely no idea
what she'’s talking about.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.101
Let'’s get you another drink.

30:47.584 --> 30:50.500
[crickets chirp]

30:50.500 --> 30:52.938
[electronic dance music]

31:17.527 --> 31:18.964
You okay, hon?

31:18.964 --> 31:21.836
Yeah.
Just a bit pissed, you know?

31:21.836 --> 31:23.272
I think I might go to bed.

31:23.272 --> 31:26.580
No way, babe,
the night is young.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.235
Plus, I swear that smoldering
guy had his eyes on you.

31:31.280 --> 31:35.284
Nah.
Not interested in me.

31:35.284 --> 31:37.417
Not with you girls around.

31:37.417 --> 31:41.073
It'’s okay, hon.
Go hit the sack if you want.

31:41.073 --> 31:44.946
Not everyone'’s made
for partying all night.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.253
[Todd] Fuck, yeah!
That'’s what I'’m taking about.

31:47.253 --> 31:51.779
I took a couple of these
bitches back at the beach.

31:51.779 --> 31:54.434
Let me tell you,
they are fucking singing to me.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.001
[group laughs]

31:56.001 --> 31:57.480
Let'’s turn it up, baby!

31:57.480 --> 31:59.526
[snarling]

32:02.659 --> 32:04.966
[Todd] Fuck yeah!

32:04.966 --> 32:07.447
[gurgling]

32:09.536 --> 32:12.669
[music continues]

32:18.110 --> 32:21.243
Last one in the pool'’s a loser!
[whoops]

32:21.243 --> 32:23.463
Whoo! Fuck, yeah!

32:23.463 --> 32:25.508
-Whoo-hoo!
-[laughs]

32:25.508 --> 32:28.555
-Pool party Ibiza!
-Whoo!

32:28.555 --> 32:31.732
[all laughing and cheering]

32:31.732 --> 32:33.821
[snarling]

32:39.305 --> 32:42.482
-Oh, it'’s that guy.
-Oh, yeah, off the telly.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.354
Hey, everybody
having a good time?

32:45.354 --> 32:48.183
[crowd cheers]

32:48.183 --> 32:50.185
Yeah, I was
until you turned up, you twat.

32:50.185 --> 32:53.536
Thank you.
So, ladies and gentlemen!

32:53.536 --> 32:56.496
On this night of nights,

32:56.496 --> 33:00.152
I bring to you a spectacle
the likes of which

33:00.152 --> 33:03.024
you'’ve never seen!

33:03.024 --> 33:05.679
Well, not me, I'’ve seen
pretty much everything.

33:05.679 --> 33:11.641
A show that will challenge
your minds,

33:11.641 --> 33:16.342
your souls,
your very principles!

33:16.342 --> 33:19.562
[crowd cheers]

33:19.562 --> 33:21.695
Again, I haven'’t got
any principles,

33:21.695 --> 33:24.089
so it doesn'’t count for me.

33:24.089 --> 33:27.744
And brace yourselves.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.616
Let the entertainment begin!

33:29.616 --> 33:31.270
[crowd cheers]

33:31.270 --> 33:32.749
[upbeat electronic music]

33:32.749 --> 33:36.231
[growls]

33:37.928 --> 33:40.148
[engine buzzing]

33:43.978 --> 33:45.545
[chainsaw revs]

34:16.619 --> 34:18.230
[groans softly]

34:18.230 --> 34:21.059
I would love to cut
someone'’s arm off like that.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.583
[Jim]
This is the second-greatest
thing I'’ve ever seen in my life.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.933
As if you'’ve seen
anything better than this.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.152
[Jim] I saw a little bit
of your sister'’s nipple

34:28.152 --> 34:29.763
-in the swimming pool
-Oh, I'’m gonna be sick.

34:29.763 --> 34:31.460
Absolute twat.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.873
[snarls]

34:53.873 --> 34:55.963
[Gunter yelping]

35:03.623 --> 35:06.016
[women screaming]

35:09.150 --> 35:10.804
[music continues]

35:37.439 --> 35:39.006
[snarling
and screaming continue]

35:48.624 --> 35:51.279
-Is this the way out?!
-How am I supposed to know?

35:51.279 --> 35:54.152
-[Alex] Oh, shit!
-[zombies snarling]

35:55.414 --> 35:57.111
She'’s too slippery, mate!

36:00.114 --> 36:03.596
[gurgles]

36:03.596 --> 36:05.685
-Just leave her, she'’s dead.
-Let'’s not take any chances.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.340
because if she wakes up
again and bites then--

36:08.340 --> 36:09.689
oh, just check.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.560
She'’s definitely dead.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.388
-She'’s dead, just leave her.
-No, she is dead, mate.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.260
I'’ve got a bit of a semi.

36:15.260 --> 36:18.045
Fine, absolutely fine,
let'’s go, let'’s just go.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.658
[laughs]
Oh, that was nuts!

36:22.658 --> 36:24.486
Can you just stop
enjoying yourself?

36:24.486 --> 36:26.271
We just saw people get killed.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.229
No, Alex, we just saw
people get killed by zombies.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.709
That'’s different.
That'’s cooler.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.072
No, it'’s fine, man.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.248
They can'’t--
look, it'’s a push door.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.816
-[laughs]
-[zombie snarls]

36:49.816 --> 36:52.775
Oh, oh, please don'’t--
please don'’t bite me.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.429
Tell you what,
you'’re just perfect ho for that.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.083
And I'’ll kiss
your friend as well.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.346
Oh, yeah, not the--
fuck off the guys, just the--

36:58.346 --> 37:00.218
I'’m calling Ellie,
see if she'’s okay.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.220
What are you
calling her for, man?

37:02.220 --> 37:05.179
At this time of night,
she'’ll just be tucked up in bed,

37:05.179 --> 37:09.227
lightly touching herself
to a Jane Austen novel.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.837
Oh, yeah.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.419
[phone buzzes]

37:27.419 --> 37:31.988
Ellie, Ellie.
Leave it, okay?

37:31.988 --> 37:35.818
You need to relax.
Okay, just relax.

37:38.343 --> 37:40.562
Ah, she'’s not answering.
I'’ll call Liz.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.608
Duh, she'’s not
gonna answer either.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.131
Why not?

37:44.131 --> 37:46.089
[sighs] Because
she'’ll be lezzing off

37:46.089 --> 37:49.876
with Zara, of course,
real life, not like a porno.

37:52.095 --> 37:53.880
[light electronic music playing]

38:03.498 --> 38:05.718
Oh, babe,
he'’s not even looking.

38:05.718 --> 38:08.373
-Losing your touch.
-Shut up.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.723
This is unbelievable,
Miss Goody Two Shoes there

38:10.723 --> 38:12.333
is like getting some action

38:12.333 --> 38:14.814
whilst I'’m here lezzing
it off with you.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.163
No offense, of course.

38:16.163 --> 38:19.993
Shut up, Zara.
You wish you could have me.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.082
Right, if I'’m not gonna get
any action,

38:22.082 --> 38:23.692
I'’m gonna go to bed.

38:23.692 --> 38:24.998
You gonna come into bed?

38:24.998 --> 38:26.565
No, I think I might go
for a swim,

38:26.565 --> 38:28.349
wait for Alex to get home.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.177
If he finds out Ellie'’s
with that bloke,

38:30.177 --> 38:31.831
he'’s gonna go mental.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.094
Look, no offense
to your brother, babe,

38:34.094 --> 38:37.097
but she deserves
to have some fun.

38:37.097 --> 38:38.533
Yeah, I know.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.274
I know my brother'’s
a little dickhead,

38:40.274 --> 38:43.277
but I can'’t have him
getting any more pathetic

38:43.277 --> 38:45.366
than what he already is.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.412
Right.
I'’m gonna take this.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.718
-Good night, babe.
-Good night.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.241
Oh, my God,
this one'’s gonna have

38:51.241 --> 38:53.026
-a headache tomorrow.
-[chuckles]

38:56.203 --> 38:59.424
Oh, so you'’re calling Az,
then?

38:59.424 --> 39:01.948
-No.
-No? Well, what you doin'’?

39:01.948 --> 39:04.472
[zombies snarl,
camera clicks]

39:04.472 --> 39:06.213
Well, I'’ll call him then,
shall I?

39:06.213 --> 39:08.563
For goodness sakes.
He should be home by now.

39:08.563 --> 39:09.956
Come on, Az.

39:09.956 --> 39:12.524
[phone buzzing,
playing "La Cucaracha"]

39:20.749 --> 39:24.927
[grunts] Something'’s wrong.
None of them are answering.

39:24.927 --> 39:27.930
Right, we'’ve got to get
back to the villa now.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.192
Come on!

39:31.630 --> 39:33.675
Oh, Alex, man, come on!

39:33.675 --> 39:35.634
Granted there are zombies,
damn it,

39:35.634 --> 39:37.331
but the villa'’s miles away!

39:37.331 --> 39:38.811
There'’s literally no chance

39:38.811 --> 39:41.422
there'’ll be zombies
up there as well.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.641
[groans]

39:50.300 --> 39:51.432
[zombie growls]

39:58.657 --> 39:59.658
[gasps and yelps]

40:19.417 --> 40:20.461
[gulping gasps]

40:33.474 --> 40:34.693
[screams]

40:38.740 --> 40:40.525
[Jim] It does not stink
of rotten fish.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.265
It'’s actually
a bloody nice kebab

40:42.265 --> 40:44.485
made by a really nice
bloody kebab maker.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.965
You'’re out of your mind.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.489
Shit.

40:48.489 --> 40:52.188
-[Jim] Fuck.
-[snarling]

40:52.188 --> 40:53.625
Fucking come.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.543
[Jim whispering]
Zombies in the nightclub.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.328
Now zombies here.
What are the chances of that?

41:01.328 --> 41:03.504
-It'’s madness.
-I told ya.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.201
[zombies groaning]

41:09.118 --> 41:11.730
Maybe we could
just go back that bar,

41:11.730 --> 41:13.558
get a few beers,
check out the birds.

41:13.558 --> 41:16.212
No way!
Ellie'’s in there.

41:16.212 --> 41:18.737
Yeah, maybe we could
just go back to that bar,

41:18.737 --> 41:20.739
get a few beers,
check out the birds?

41:20.739 --> 41:22.218
My sister'’s in there, too.

41:26.919 --> 41:29.138
Did you just look at your penis
thinking about my sister?

41:29.138 --> 41:31.706
-No.
-You-- you did.

41:31.706 --> 41:34.883
I didn'’t.
Definitely didn'’t. I didn'’t

41:34.883 --> 41:38.147
We should--
we can get around the back.

41:38.147 --> 41:40.759
-Yeah, fine.
-Come on.

41:40.759 --> 41:43.326
[zombies snarling]

41:47.287 --> 41:48.984
[snarling and gurgling]

41:55.643 --> 41:59.386
Stop smiling,
you fucking son of bitch.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.431
Can'’t believe you made me hold
this bloody kebab!

42:01.431 --> 42:03.346
Yo, give it to me.
Just give me the kebab, Alex!

42:03.346 --> 42:05.958
-I'’m gonna, I'’m gonna swing.
-Just give me the kebab

42:05.958 --> 42:07.916
-and I will let you down.
-How are we gonna do this?

42:07.916 --> 42:09.614
-You'’re just gonna hand it to--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:09.614 --> 42:11.311
Whoa, whoa, okay, okay,
I'’m gonna give to you,

42:11.311 --> 42:13.139
-I'’m gonna give it to you.
-Hand me the kebab.

42:13.139 --> 42:15.402
-See, how easy was that?
-You almost
just bloody killed me.

42:15.402 --> 42:16.969
Just given me
the kebab in the first place--

42:16.969 --> 42:18.536
That doner'’s gonna be
the killer of us, man!

42:18.536 --> 42:20.102
Oh, shit!
Hands off my bloody doner!

42:20.102 --> 42:21.713
Alex, do something!

42:21.713 --> 42:24.106
Just throw the kebab.
Kebab might distract him.

42:24.106 --> 42:26.195
No, Alex, you throw
yourkebab at him.

42:26.195 --> 42:28.458
-Well, I haven'’t got a kebab.
-Well, then use something else.

42:28.458 --> 42:29.503
-What?
-Use that!

42:33.028 --> 42:33.986
[grunts]

42:35.988 --> 42:37.293
Dude.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.080
[Jim groans]

42:41.080 --> 42:42.516
[blows landing]

42:45.519 --> 42:47.521
[blood splattering,
bones crunching]

42:49.654 --> 42:52.657
Oh, that is disgusting.

42:52.657 --> 42:54.572
Oh, it'’s almost enough
to put me off my...

42:57.052 --> 42:59.751
-Mmm.
-Come on, let'’s go.

42:59.751 --> 43:01.927
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

43:01.927 --> 43:03.102
Alex?

43:03.102 --> 43:05.539
Yeah?

43:05.539 --> 43:07.106
Did that zombie
just say "dude"?

43:09.456 --> 43:10.631
No.

43:10.631 --> 43:15.244
No, I mean, that was a--

43:15.244 --> 43:16.724
that was a zombie growl,
wasn'’t it?

43:16.724 --> 43:19.466
Yeah. Yeah.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.947
That-- that was
a zombie growl, wasn'’t it?

43:21.947 --> 43:23.601
-Yeah.
-That was, yeah?

43:23.601 --> 43:26.299
Yeah, definitely, yeah.
Yeah.

43:26.299 --> 43:28.649
Yeah.
Zombie, definite zombie.

43:30.956 --> 43:35.569
Jesus.
Oh, thank God you'’re all right.

43:35.569 --> 43:37.353
Yeah, we'’re fine.

43:37.353 --> 43:39.704
But there are shit load
of zombies out there.

43:39.704 --> 43:42.924
Whoa, did you mash up
a zombie, too, Liz?

43:42.924 --> 43:44.752
-Is Ellie okay?
-Yeah, she'’s fine.

43:44.752 --> 43:46.362
-Well, where is she?
-She'’s inside.

43:46.362 --> 43:47.668
No, but I--
I wouldn'’t-- I wouldn'’t--

43:50.192 --> 43:52.978
-What, no hug for me?
-[scoffs] Fuck off.

43:52.978 --> 43:55.981
-Do you wanna share this?
-Fuck off.

43:55.981 --> 43:57.722
Fuck it, I have some
interracial stuff on my laptop.

43:57.722 --> 43:59.637
I'’ll just have a wank instead.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.682
Ellie! Ellie--

44:01.682 --> 44:04.990
Dude, what the fuck?

44:04.990 --> 44:07.732
This is totes not cool,
I just spent the last

44:07.732 --> 44:09.734
long, arduous 20 minutes
on foreplay.

44:09.734 --> 44:12.345
[Ellie] What? You said you
were a trained masseuse.

44:14.913 --> 44:17.567
Alex, is that blood
on your shoes?

44:17.567 --> 44:20.570
What the hell is going on?

44:20.570 --> 44:24.096
Well... there'’s loads
of zombies outside.

44:24.096 --> 44:26.098
A-and I'’ve had to kill some.

44:26.098 --> 44:27.577
I come to warn you,

44:27.577 --> 44:29.884
but I don'’t know why
I bothered now.

44:29.884 --> 44:31.756
Look, this is total
bertie bollocks.

44:31.756 --> 44:35.368
Okay, come on Ellie.
We'’ve got business to finish.

44:35.368 --> 44:37.065
It'’s your turn
to give mea rubdown,

44:37.065 --> 44:38.458
if you know what I mean,

44:38.458 --> 44:41.026
and you, wanker,
if you interrupt us again,

44:41.026 --> 44:42.723
I will knock
your bloody block off.

44:42.723 --> 44:44.682
Alex,
are you telling the truth?

44:44.682 --> 44:46.509
-Yeah.
-He is.

44:46.509 --> 44:47.815
Zombies, thousands of them.

44:49.948 --> 44:53.212
What-- are you two--
that'’s a bit awkward, isn'’t it?

44:53.212 --> 44:54.561
Shut up, Jim.

44:54.561 --> 44:56.781
Look, there'’s not
thousands of '’em,

44:56.781 --> 44:59.044
but there'’s at least 30
surrounding the house.

44:59.044 --> 45:00.915
Oh, God.

45:00.915 --> 45:03.788
Look, Ellie, if you'’re not
gonna nosh me off,

45:03.788 --> 45:05.746
then I'’m getting out of here,
all right?

45:05.746 --> 45:07.052
It'’s been fun guys,

45:07.052 --> 45:09.097
but this is Rupes
saying sayonara.

45:09.097 --> 45:10.838
I'’m gonna call a cab.

45:10.838 --> 45:13.058
Like you'’re gonna
have any luck with that, mate.

45:13.058 --> 45:14.450
There'’s a zombie
apocalypse outside.

45:14.450 --> 45:15.669
You'’re not gonna have
any signal.

45:15.669 --> 45:17.279
Three bars, actually.

45:20.543 --> 45:22.458
Oh, yeah, so do I.
That'’s weird.

45:22.458 --> 45:25.418
Anyway, catch you around,
sugar tits.

45:25.418 --> 45:28.508
Oh, uh, by the way,
has anybody seen Todd?

45:28.508 --> 45:30.510
Who'’s Todd?

45:30.510 --> 45:33.339
[sighs] Ciao, losers.

45:33.339 --> 45:35.428
Look, never mind Todd.
Have you seen Az?

45:35.428 --> 45:38.300
-He'’s nowhere to be found.
-Wasn'’t he with you?

45:38.300 --> 45:40.215
You'’ve not lost him,
have you?

45:40.215 --> 45:43.218
No. He said
he was coming back here.

45:43.218 --> 45:44.611
Well, is one of you
gonna call him?

45:44.611 --> 45:47.701
Jim can.
I-- I haven'’t got any signal.

45:47.701 --> 45:49.703
You'’re not gonna have any
signals on airplane mode.

45:49.703 --> 45:51.879
Are you, Alex?
Such a tight bastard.

45:51.879 --> 45:53.098
[Alex] Thank you.

45:55.404 --> 45:57.624
[phone buzzing,
playing "La Cucaracha"]

46:03.499 --> 46:04.849
[zombie growls]

46:26.000 --> 46:29.264
Voicemail,
he could be anywhere.

46:29.264 --> 46:32.833
God.
His mom'’s gonna bloody kill us.

46:32.833 --> 46:33.791
[Rupert shouts]

46:38.404 --> 46:39.884
[Ellie] Does it hurt?

46:39.884 --> 46:42.582
Of course it bloody well hurts.
Look at it.

46:42.582 --> 46:46.891
Some madman just ate my phone
and took a piece of me with it.

46:46.891 --> 46:48.806
Well, just chill, yeah?

46:48.806 --> 46:51.112
And pleasetry not
to get blood on the sofa.

46:51.112 --> 46:53.071
My deposit'’s already fucked.

46:53.071 --> 46:56.074
-Is that supposed to be
some sort of joke?
-Have you seen the pool?

46:56.074 --> 46:59.338
Look at him. He has to go.
He'’s gonna turn.

46:59.338 --> 47:01.819
No way, piss off,
I'’m not leaving anywhere

47:01.819 --> 47:03.603
unless it'’s in an ambulance.

47:03.603 --> 47:06.693
You, Kenan and Kel
with three bars, you call one.

47:06.693 --> 47:10.871
Right, that is both offensive
and probably also racist, right?

47:10.871 --> 47:14.222
But given the situation
we find ourselves in...

47:14.222 --> 47:15.180
[phone beeps]

47:18.052 --> 47:19.967
They'’re not even answering,
anyway.

47:19.967 --> 47:21.882
Did me and Alex not explain
that we came from a nightclub

47:21.882 --> 47:23.797
that turned into
a zombie bloodbath earlier?

47:23.797 --> 47:26.539
- They'’re probably busy.
-If we'’re not
gonna turf him out,

47:26.539 --> 47:29.150
well... we'’re just gonna
have to kill '’em ourselves.

47:29.150 --> 47:30.891
Alex, we'’re not
killing anyone.

47:30.891 --> 47:33.241
-He'’s infected.
-Look, you prick.

47:33.241 --> 47:34.982
Okay, I'’m sorry that
your girlfriend fancies me.

47:34.982 --> 47:36.984
This is all getting a bit
too dramatic for my liking.

47:36.984 --> 47:41.162
Ex-girlfriend.
And I don'’t fancy you.

47:41.162 --> 47:43.904
-Oh, come on.
-Um, guys?

47:43.904 --> 47:46.820
I don'’t mean to alarm you,
but there'’s a bunch of ugly

47:46.820 --> 47:48.778
motherfucking zombies
outside the villa.

47:48.778 --> 47:51.869
Yeah, cheers, anyone got
anything constructive to say?

47:51.869 --> 47:54.610
-We need to kill him.
-Alex,
we'’re not killing anybody.

47:54.610 --> 47:57.657
W-wait, why are we even
discussing killing someone?

47:57.657 --> 47:59.659
He'’s been bitten
by a zombie.

47:59.659 --> 48:03.358
Well,
have you considered, uh,

48:03.358 --> 48:05.404
maybe amputating his hand?

48:05.404 --> 48:08.668
What?
I need my bloody hand.

48:08.668 --> 48:10.583
Wait, that--
that could work.

48:10.583 --> 48:13.760
If we get to the infection
before it hits his brain.

48:13.760 --> 48:16.154
[scoffs] G-girls.

48:16.154 --> 48:18.199
Come on, you'’re not
gonna let him do this.

48:18.199 --> 48:20.027
You can'’t chop
my fucking hand off.

48:20.027 --> 48:21.507
Look, man, I'’ve had enough
of this, yeah?

48:21.507 --> 48:22.987
You'’re doing my head in.

48:22.987 --> 48:24.727
Five minutes ago,
it was your bloody hand.

48:24.727 --> 48:26.904
Any more of your
little procrastination,

48:26.904 --> 48:29.210
I'’m gonna have to take
more of your physique off.

48:29.210 --> 48:30.864
Probably be
your whole arm next.

48:30.864 --> 48:33.432
And any more delay,
it'’s gonna be your head.

48:33.432 --> 48:35.608
[Liz] I don'’t say this
very often,

48:35.608 --> 48:38.263
but I think these
dickheads might be right.

48:38.263 --> 48:39.829
Rupert,
it'’s your choice, all right?

48:39.829 --> 48:42.180
We try amputating your hand,
or you leave now

48:42.180 --> 48:44.008
and take your chances
with the zombies.

48:44.008 --> 48:45.357
We can'’t risk you turning.

48:52.190 --> 48:53.408
[Rupert] Ellie...

48:59.762 --> 49:02.809
Okay. Okay.

49:02.809 --> 49:04.463
[shuddering breath]

49:04.463 --> 49:06.552
Um-- [clears throat]

49:06.552 --> 49:08.249
just need to do
something first.

49:19.695 --> 49:21.828
[sniffs]

49:21.828 --> 49:23.830
[inhales deeply]

49:28.617 --> 49:30.402
That'’s ketamine.

49:30.402 --> 49:34.275
Five minutes time,
I won'’t be able to feel my arm.

49:34.275 --> 49:36.538
Oh, I'’ll take that.

49:36.538 --> 49:39.933
Alex, go and find
a knife or something.

49:39.933 --> 49:42.588
-Yes.
-[sighs]

49:42.588 --> 49:45.243
I actually think it might be
better if we just got a gun,

49:45.243 --> 49:46.984
Like a shotgun and just took
the whole thing clean off.

49:46.984 --> 49:48.768
Jim, if you can'’t say
anything fucking useful,

49:48.768 --> 49:50.248
then just stay out of it.

49:50.248 --> 49:53.860
Can'’t say anything useful,
eh?

49:53.860 --> 49:56.906
How about...

49:56.906 --> 49:59.431
ordering a bloody rescue,
getting us out of here?

49:59.431 --> 50:01.085
Hmm?

50:01.085 --> 50:04.218
[atmospheric electronic music,
phone buzzing]

50:09.223 --> 50:11.095
[tires screech, car crashes]

50:12.879 --> 50:15.447

[zombies snarling]

50:21.061 --> 50:24.847
[gunfire and screaming continue]

50:30.157 --> 50:32.855
Yo.

50:32.855 --> 50:36.468
Hello, mate, hi, how you doing?
It'’s, uh-- it'’s Jim.

50:36.468 --> 50:39.166
The guy that you picked up
with the other two guys

50:39.166 --> 50:43.518
and the girl in the van
to take the villa earlier.

50:43.518 --> 50:47.044
Yeah, um, I was just wondering
if maybe, I don'’t know,

50:47.044 --> 50:49.263
you wanted to come up here
and sort of maybe rescue us?

50:49.263 --> 50:52.005
No, man.

50:52.005 --> 50:53.833
[sirens wailing]

50:53.833 --> 50:56.270
I ain'’t going nowhere.

50:56.270 --> 51:00.187
-[gunfire continues]
-Have you not looked outside?

51:00.187 --> 51:01.797
[explosions]

51:01.797 --> 51:06.106
That'’s some end-of-days shit,
right there.

51:06.106 --> 51:10.110
Yeah, uh, that'’s kind of what
I'’m calling you about, actually.

51:10.110 --> 51:11.851
We'’ve-- we'’ve sort
of got a few zombies

51:11.851 --> 51:14.158
up here as well and stuff,
and I wondered if maybe

51:14.158 --> 51:16.116
you wanted to come down here
and rescue us

51:16.116 --> 51:18.814
and bring your shotgun?

51:18.814 --> 51:20.381
I mean,
we'’ll pay you, obviously.

51:20.381 --> 51:21.774
[whispers]
Has anyone got any money?

51:21.774 --> 51:24.124
-[siren wailing]
No, man.

51:24.124 --> 51:27.084
Money'’s no good to me.

51:27.084 --> 51:29.999
[laughs, gunfire continues]

51:29.999 --> 51:33.525
Not much you can
buy in an apocalypse.

51:33.525 --> 51:35.570
You get me? [laughs]

51:39.444 --> 51:41.185
Yeah, right.

51:41.185 --> 51:43.970
Yeah, he'’s not--
he'’s not having it.

51:43.970 --> 51:46.233
Don'’t be long.
Do not be long.

51:46.233 --> 51:48.105
[clears throat] Hello?

51:48.105 --> 51:52.152
[gunfire continues]

51:52.152 --> 51:54.023
Who is this?

51:54.023 --> 51:57.549
There are three
hot-ass bitches here.

51:57.549 --> 52:01.335
Yeah? And we would
really appreciate it

52:01.335 --> 52:03.598
if you came and rescued us.

52:03.598 --> 52:08.473
And how do I know you are not
one of your English...

52:11.040 --> 52:13.217
munters?

52:13.217 --> 52:15.654
Munters?

52:15.654 --> 52:20.224
Sir, look, I will send you
a photo, okay?

52:20.224 --> 52:24.358
I don'’t care about your face.

52:24.358 --> 52:27.927
I just wanna see your titties.

52:27.927 --> 52:29.407
Titties?

52:29.407 --> 52:31.409
All three of you.

52:31.409 --> 52:33.715
[sirens wailing]

52:33.715 --> 52:35.369
And then maybe...

52:37.545 --> 52:40.200
I'’ll think it over.

52:40.200 --> 52:43.725
Um...

52:43.725 --> 52:45.074
great.

52:45.074 --> 52:47.512
Start your engine, thanks.

52:52.517 --> 52:55.215
-Okay, take a photo.
-You sure about this, yeah?

52:55.215 --> 52:57.130
-Yeah.
-Do you want me--
I should probably do this.

52:57.130 --> 53:00.089
Fuck off, Jim.
Go help Alex or something.

53:00.089 --> 53:03.180
Are we just gonna do tits?
What about some ass shots?

53:03.180 --> 53:04.964
-We don'’t know what he likes.
-I mean it.

53:04.964 --> 53:07.140
Yeah, okay.

53:07.140 --> 53:10.099
Are you sure this
is a good idea, Zara?

53:10.099 --> 53:11.927
This guy'’s a real creep.

53:11.927 --> 53:14.408
Have you got a better idea?

53:14.408 --> 53:17.455
Look, I'’m sorry for snapping,
but desperate times,

53:17.455 --> 53:20.936
and these arethe only things
we can bargain with.

53:26.028 --> 53:27.421
[camera clicks]

53:27.421 --> 53:30.076
-Yep. Yeah, nice.
-Yeah?

53:30.076 --> 53:31.773
Okay, your turn.

53:34.559 --> 53:36.387
Fucking hurry up, Zar.

53:36.387 --> 53:39.955
Hold on, I'’m just trying to get
the right Instagram filter.

53:39.955 --> 53:42.088
-[camera clicks]
-Yep, got it.

53:42.088 --> 53:44.221
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.179
Right, Ellie, pop them out.

53:46.179 --> 53:49.095
What?
You can leave me out of it.

53:49.095 --> 53:52.011
This might be our only way
out of here.

53:52.011 --> 53:54.927
I'’m not texting some weirdo
topless pictures.

53:54.927 --> 53:57.103
You girls didn'’t see
this guy earlier.

53:57.103 --> 53:58.800
I really don'’t trust him.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.324
Oh, he'’s not that bad, Ellie.
For God'’s sake.

54:00.324 --> 54:01.890
Trust you to make
a big deal of it.

54:01.890 --> 54:03.936
They'’re not even that big,
anyway.

54:03.936 --> 54:06.286
You didn'’t mind getting them out
for this loser, did ya?

54:06.286 --> 54:08.027
[cries]

54:08.027 --> 54:09.942
Look, Ellie, I-I'’m sorry.

54:09.942 --> 54:13.032
Forget it, Alex!

54:13.032 --> 54:15.469
You girls
can sort yourselves out.

54:15.469 --> 54:17.384
I want no part of this.

54:17.384 --> 54:19.386
Oh, well done, lads.

54:19.386 --> 54:23.260
I see why you'’re such
a fucking hit with the ladies.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.087
Oh, well this is great,
isn'’t it?

54:25.087 --> 54:27.264
Where are we gonna find a
third pair of tits for him now?

54:33.139 --> 54:34.967
Oh-- oh,
you can all piss off.

54:34.967 --> 54:36.316
[phone chimes]

54:36.316 --> 54:38.275
[gunfire, car alarms blaring]

54:55.509 --> 54:59.383
Oh, mama.

54:59.383 --> 55:02.037
[groans]

55:02.037 --> 55:04.997
I feel fucking violated, man.
Get off me.

55:04.997 --> 55:08.653
Uh, guys, I don'’t mean
to interrupt a deep moment,

55:08.653 --> 55:12.178
but his whole arm
is turning black.

55:14.876 --> 55:18.271
Jim...
grab his arm, mate.

55:18.271 --> 55:19.925
My pleasure, doctor.

55:19.925 --> 55:22.101
Alex, are you sure
you know what you'’re doing?

55:22.101 --> 55:23.929
-Do you want me to do it?
-No, no.

55:25.887 --> 55:27.846
I'’ll do this.

55:27.846 --> 55:30.892
I'’m gonna--
I'’m gonna go pack.

55:34.722 --> 55:36.594
I think I'’m gonna be sick.

55:45.211 --> 55:47.082
[Rupert murmurs]

55:50.042 --> 55:52.610
[Alex] Fuck.
Fuck, shit.

55:52.610 --> 55:54.176
-Fuck.
-[Rupert mumbling]

56:00.400 --> 56:02.359
-Oh, shit.
-[laughs]

56:10.976 --> 56:14.806
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Shit, fuck.

[belches]

56:34.739 --> 56:35.914
Hello?

56:40.875 --> 56:42.007
Jim?

56:46.664 --> 56:47.926
Alex?

56:59.459 --> 57:00.808
Stay there.

57:00.808 --> 57:03.898
[all laughing]

57:10.688 --> 57:13.081
Where'’s my other arm?

57:13.081 --> 57:14.822
What are you doing?

57:14.822 --> 57:17.999
[laughter continues]

57:17.999 --> 57:21.263
[Rupert, weakly] Maybe we
should do this in the morning?

57:21.263 --> 57:23.483
No, it'’s not breaking.
Jim?

57:23.483 --> 57:25.659
Jim, just fucking smash it.

57:25.659 --> 57:27.661
Just fucking break it.

57:27.661 --> 57:29.271
-[grunts]
-Fucking Ellie.

57:29.271 --> 57:31.491
[bone cracking]

57:31.491 --> 57:32.884
Go, go, break it.

57:32.884 --> 57:34.494
[bone cracks]

57:34.494 --> 57:36.931
Fuck. Fuck.

57:36.931 --> 57:37.932
Fuck.

Hello.

[muffled screaming]

58:38.210 --> 58:40.560
[Maria grunting]

58:46.610 --> 58:48.176
[tape ripping]

58:50.614 --> 58:53.399
Ah, shit!
Watch the door!

58:53.399 --> 58:55.923
Well, w-what about him?

58:55.923 --> 58:59.492
I handle him.
Look out for Karl.

59:10.416 --> 59:13.550
Oh, hi, Karl!
We'’re down here.

59:17.336 --> 59:18.555
Yeah, come on.

59:21.253 --> 59:24.082
Well, aren'’t you
a sight for sore eyes.

59:24.082 --> 59:27.912
Just in time, too,
I'’m about to fuck off the island

59:27.912 --> 59:31.002
-before the cops turn up.
-[Maria] Leave him alone.

59:31.002 --> 59:33.526
He came back for me,
not for you.

59:33.526 --> 59:35.833
Well, actually I was
just looking for a way out.

59:35.833 --> 59:38.966
I hardly think he'’s gonna be
interested in... that.

59:38.966 --> 59:42.056
So, what do you say,
young Az?

59:42.056 --> 59:44.668
How do you fancy sailing off
into the sunset

59:44.668 --> 59:46.800
on Uncle Karl'’s yacht?

59:46.800 --> 59:49.020
Thanks for the offer.

59:49.020 --> 59:52.240
And I really appreciate this.

59:52.240 --> 59:56.201
And I'’m sure you'’re a--
a lovely man and everything,

59:56.201 --> 59:59.813
But, you know, [grunts] with
a [grunts] and a [whistles]?

59:59.813 --> 01:00:01.336
Well, your loss.

01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:03.991
Oh, if you'’re looking
for the yacht keys,

01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:05.427
they'’re in that drawer.

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:07.821
Be a sweetheart
and throw them over, would you?

01:00:17.831 --> 01:00:19.703
Thanks. Now--

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:22.444
Don'’t move,
you fucking freak.

01:00:25.447 --> 01:00:28.712
Sorry, what are you gonna do?
Shoot me, huh?

01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:32.672
You?
The worst promo girl in Ibiza?

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:34.805
[chuckles]

01:00:34.805 --> 01:00:37.546
Oh, yeah.

01:00:37.546 --> 01:00:40.114
-[gun lighter clicks]
-Ooh!

01:00:40.114 --> 01:00:43.509
You see what'’s happened
there is...

01:00:45.337 --> 01:00:47.600
I'’ve got the real gun.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.081
Kind of similar,
aren'’t they?

01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:53.519
-[snarls]
-Easy to get confused.

01:00:53.519 --> 01:00:55.216
Now--

01:00:55.216 --> 01:00:57.392
You'’ll have to go
through me first.

01:00:57.392 --> 01:00:59.568
Oh, don'’t worry.

01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:01.483
I was planning to.

01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:03.268
Do you mean
in like a gay way?

01:01:03.268 --> 01:01:04.835
[Antonio growls]

01:01:04.835 --> 01:01:08.360
Sorry,
I'’m no good with innuendo.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:12.016
[snarls]

01:01:12.016 --> 01:01:13.234
Good night, sweetheart.

01:01:13.234 --> 01:01:15.236
[roars]

01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:16.673
[muffled screaming]

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:23.767
[sighs]

01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:29.729
Thought you were supposed
to be looking after Rupert?

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:32.601
Chill, bitch.
Alex is looking after Rupert.

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:35.039
And Ellie'’s looking after Alex
to make sure

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:38.259
Alex doesn'’t cut any more
of Rupert'’s limbs off.

01:01:38.259 --> 01:01:40.348
It'’s all fine.
What are you up to, anyway?

01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:43.569
Come here.

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:45.832
I mean,
you know about all these...

01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:47.355
things.

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:51.359
Do you think they
remember who they were?

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:54.406
Remember who they used to be?

01:01:54.406 --> 01:01:55.407
I don'’t know.

01:01:56.887 --> 01:01:59.977
They seem so...

01:01:59.977 --> 01:02:01.195
sad.

01:02:03.023 --> 01:02:04.068
[sighs]

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:12.772
We'’re going to end up
like that, aren'’t we?

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:14.643
You never know, it might be--

01:02:14.643 --> 01:02:16.776
might be fun being a zombie.

01:02:16.776 --> 01:02:18.822
Shut up, you twat.

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:20.824
You'’re supposed to be
making me feel better

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:24.044
and saying
it'’s all gonna be fine.

01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:26.133
Sorry.

01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:28.962
You really are
a useless prick, aren'’t ya?

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:31.704
Yeah, and you'’re a bossy cow.
With great tits, though.

01:02:31.704 --> 01:02:34.272
Bossy?
Do you think I'’m bossy?

01:02:34.272 --> 01:02:37.014
I'’m only trying
to look after everyone.

01:02:37.014 --> 01:02:39.190
With great tits
come great responsibility.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.453
Fuck, can you be serious
for just one minute?

01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:44.543
Is there ever an end
to your bullshit?

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:46.893
No, I mean it, I mean,
we'’ve all got our roles.

01:02:46.893 --> 01:02:49.243
I mean,
you'’re the kick-ass bitch.

01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:50.897
-I'’m the funny one--
-Sorry...

01:02:50.897 --> 01:02:52.333
the funny one?

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:55.119
You think
you'’re the funny one?

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:57.904
No, you'’re about
as funny as bowel cancer.

01:02:57.904 --> 01:03:00.080
I thought the funny one
was that--

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.169
what'’s his name,
that little one?

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:03.605
I thought
he was the funny one.

01:03:03.605 --> 01:03:05.520
-What, Az?
-Yeah.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.392
No.

01:03:07.392 --> 01:03:10.917
Suppose we probably should try
and find him, though, you know?

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:14.007
Hang on.

01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:16.009
If I'’m not the funny one,
then what have I got left?

01:03:16.009 --> 01:03:17.489
The fat one?

01:03:17.489 --> 01:03:19.230
The one who'’s man boobs
you laugh at?

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.275
I don'’t know, who knows?

01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:22.842
You might actually
be a nice person

01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:24.888
underneath all that crap.

01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:30.502
I just want to go home
and just...

01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:33.810
s-see my parents, you know?

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.856
Zombie apocalypse
isn'’t all it'’s cracked up to be.

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:39.598
It'’s more--

01:03:39.598 --> 01:03:41.600
more real, you know?

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.863
I know.
We'’ll be home soon.

01:03:43.863 --> 01:03:46.910
No.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:49.216
No. I know how
this is gonna end for me.

01:03:49.216 --> 01:03:51.871
I'’m destined to be
an all-you-can-eat buffet

01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:54.265
for-- for zombies.

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:58.660
It'’s ironic, really, considering
that'’s the only thing

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.316
I'’ve ever been any good at
in my whole stupid life.

01:04:02.316 --> 01:04:04.492
I'’m too young to die, Liz.

01:04:04.492 --> 01:04:09.019
Too many all-you-can-eat buffets
yet to conquer.

01:04:09.019 --> 01:04:11.325
Too many sluts to bang,
you know?

01:04:11.325 --> 01:04:13.545
You might actually have a bit
of luck with the women

01:04:13.545 --> 01:04:15.852
if you didn'’t call them sluts
and bitches all the time, James.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.332
Just a bit of little friendly
advice for you there.

01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:21.248
Nah, it doesn'’t matter
what I call them.

01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:24.512
They'’re not interested in me.

01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:29.082
Destined to die alone a virgin
on this stupid fucking island.

01:04:29.082 --> 01:04:32.390
Oh, God,
I can'’t believe I'’m about to--

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:34.348
if you tell anyone this,
I will kill you.

01:04:34.348 --> 01:04:36.220
I mean that,
I'’ll fucking kill you.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.265
You saw the zombie in the pool.
You know I'’m capable.

01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:42.574
Tell anyone what?

01:04:42.574 --> 01:04:44.881
And I'’m doing this because
I actually think

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.231
we'’re not gonna live to see
another day on this island.

01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:49.842
Oh, Jesus Christ, I can'’t
believe I'’m gonna do this.

01:04:49.842 --> 01:04:51.583
God, I must be fucking ill.

01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:57.458
Do what?

01:04:57.458 --> 01:05:01.245
Look you dickhead, do you wanna
die a virgin or not?

01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:02.768
No.

01:05:08.948 --> 01:05:10.341
[zombies snarling]

01:05:17.522 --> 01:05:19.698
[Rupert groans]

01:05:22.092 --> 01:05:24.659
[wheezing]

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.968
Alex, wake up.

01:05:28.968 --> 01:05:30.709
What?

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:32.580
It'’s Rupert.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.973
He'’s making noises.

01:05:33.973 --> 01:05:37.324
[wheezing groan]

01:05:37.324 --> 01:05:41.894
Did that sound like a--
you know, a human groan

01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:43.548
Or a zombie one?

01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:46.029
I don'’t know,
you'’re the one who knows

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.508
what sound he makes
when he groans.

01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:51.121
Oh, leave it.
I'’m gonna check for a pulse.

01:05:57.127 --> 01:05:58.693
Wait. Wait.

01:05:58.693 --> 01:06:00.434
I'’ll do it.

01:06:00.434 --> 01:06:01.870
Are you sure?

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.524
Well, yeah.

01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:06.875
Well, if he does turn,
it could get quite nasty,

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:09.791
and I'’ve already killed
two zombies already,

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:11.880
so, uh, well,
it shouldn'’t be too hard.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.579
This macho stuff
does not suit you, Alex.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.942
I can'’t-- I can'’t
really feel anything.

01:06:29.942 --> 01:06:32.771
[growling]

01:06:32.771 --> 01:06:34.512
Ellie, Ellie!

01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.296
-Alex!
-Get the knife!

01:06:36.296 --> 01:06:38.864
Get the knife!
Get the knife!

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:42.650
Brains!
Get him in the brains!

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:46.176
Brains! Not in the back of
the head, through the eye!

01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:47.786
-Really?!
-Yes!

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:50.310
[roaring]

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:52.095
-I can'’t go through the eye!
-Wherever!

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:55.576
-Through the ear!
-Wherever!

01:06:55.576 --> 01:06:57.796
Fuck off, Rupert,
you prick!

01:06:57.796 --> 01:06:59.058
[knife squelches]

01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:01.930
[roaring fades]

01:07:06.283 --> 01:07:08.850
Ellie...
could you give us a hand?

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:25.954
Liz, Big Jim number two
has reawoken.

01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:27.434
Ready for deployment.

01:07:27.434 --> 01:07:30.481
We should probably
go again straightaway.

01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:34.398
Liz. Liz, let'’s go.

01:07:34.398 --> 01:07:36.574
Oh, too hung over, eh?

01:07:36.574 --> 01:07:38.445
I think what you need
is probably some breakfast.

01:07:38.445 --> 01:07:42.014
Oh, I'’ll just take
this opportunity to just...

01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.151
-Oh, that'’s a video.
-[phone beeps]

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:54.157
Oh, that'’s lovely.

01:07:54.157 --> 01:07:55.723
See that'’s what
I like about you.

01:07:55.723 --> 01:07:57.725
is a normally
the big-titted bitches,

01:07:57.725 --> 01:07:59.771
they don'’t have a good ass
unless they'’ve had implants,

01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:01.338
but you,
you got both areas covered

01:08:01.338 --> 01:08:04.819
which is why
I like you a lot, good stuff.

01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:10.303
So is there anything
that I should get

01:08:10.303 --> 01:08:12.697
while I'’m down at the fridge,
for us to incorporate

01:08:12.697 --> 01:08:15.439
into the next part
of our sexual adventure?

01:08:15.439 --> 01:08:18.658
I'’m talking things like
whipped cream, strawberries?

01:08:18.658 --> 01:08:21.140
I think I saw chocolate mousse
down there, actually.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:24.100
I'’ll surprise you.
[sighs]

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.102
Lovely day out there,
isn'’t it?

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.800
Shame we'’re not gonna see any of
it '’cause of all these zombies,

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.063
and obviously the fact
that I'’ll be in here

01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:33.020
hanging out the back of you.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.938
-Jesus, all right.
-[groans]

01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:38.549
[fades]
Fuckin'’ Liz in the bed...

01:08:41.247 --> 01:08:44.424
Oh, Liz, yeah,
suckin'’-- suckin'’ me off

01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:47.252
all damn night
and all through to the morning!

01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:49.081
Taking it doggy style!

01:08:49.081 --> 01:08:50.517
When I give it to
you doggy style,

01:08:50.517 --> 01:08:52.737
I'’m begging for more,
a dirty bit--

01:08:52.737 --> 01:08:56.567
-the fuck have you been up to?
-He turned.

01:08:56.567 --> 01:08:58.350
I did tell you he would,
didn'’t I, come on.

01:08:58.350 --> 01:09:00.005
Why the fuck
are you so cheerful?

01:09:00.005 --> 01:09:03.703
You know Alex, just a post-sex
with Liz glow.

01:09:03.703 --> 01:09:05.706
You know how it is.

01:09:05.706 --> 01:09:08.622
I'’m just gonna go in there
and rustle up some breakfast,

01:09:08.622 --> 01:09:11.799
-Sex makes you really hungry.
-James, we really haven'’t
got time for this now.

01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:15.194
-We need to make a run for it.
-What about
the rescue I ordered?

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:17.370
Well, he'’s obviously
not coming, is he?

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:20.068
Come on, we need to get Liz
and Zara and get out of here.

01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:22.375
Yeah, be my guest, go up
and get Liz, but I warn you,

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:24.247
she'’s looking pretty
shagged out about right now.

01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:27.118
Can you just shut
the fuck up about my sister?

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:29.077
Jim, you'’ve had those condoms
in your pocket

01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:31.254
since you were seven,
and I'’m pretty sure

01:09:31.254 --> 01:09:33.691
they'’re gonna stay there
until the day you die.

01:09:33.691 --> 01:09:35.736
Yeah, well,
that would be fine Alex,

01:09:35.736 --> 01:09:37.564
except I didn'’t bother
using the condoms.

01:09:37.564 --> 01:09:40.350
I barebacked her at her request,
and you should have seen me.

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:42.700
It was like
a prime silverback gorilla

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.441
going at a fucking lioness,
yeah?

01:09:44.441 --> 01:09:46.006
And not just any gorilla.

01:09:46.006 --> 01:09:48.488
It was like King Kong
fucking the sexy lioness

01:09:48.488 --> 01:09:51.709
-out of Lion King.
-Fucking dick.

01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:54.538
Look guys, can you have
this discussion somewhere else?

01:09:54.538 --> 01:09:56.888
I really don'’t wanna stay
here a second longer.

01:09:56.888 --> 01:09:59.543
Yeah, yeah.
Ellie'’s right.

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:02.198
We need to get out
of here as quick as possible

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.243
and somehow find Az.

01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:06.898
Well, I just wish we had
some weapons, you know?

01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:09.205
Just some real big sort of--
some guns coming out.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.337
Oh, yeah?
Real big guns?

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:12.947
-Yeah, just-- [grunts]
-Yeah?

01:10:12.947 --> 01:10:15.689
-This ain'’t Playstation, Jim.
-[gunshot]

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:28.789
Taxi.

01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:33.359
Taxi for the titties.

01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:38.495
[Torval snarling softly]

01:10:44.936 --> 01:10:47.852
Where are your
other lady friends?

01:10:47.852 --> 01:10:49.506
[clattering]

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:58.950
[sighs]

01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:01.953
Oh,
you must be the taxi guy.

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:04.085
Guys, why have you
not packed yet?

01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:05.565
We need to get out of here.

01:11:05.565 --> 01:11:10.091
First,
Torval gets his sexy time.

01:11:10.091 --> 01:11:14.182
Then we can all go
for a little ride.

01:11:14.182 --> 01:11:15.401
That'’s the deal.

01:11:15.401 --> 01:11:19.840
And a deal is a deal.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.974
Excuse me.

01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:25.237
We'’ve all had...

01:11:25.237 --> 01:11:29.110
a very traumatic night, yes?

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:31.852
Now,
I have a banging headache,

01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:35.421
and all we want
to do is go home.

01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:38.250
Whoa, just don'’t point
that thing at me.

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:40.948
So where is she?

01:11:40.948 --> 01:11:45.562
The one with the big...
brown...

01:11:45.562 --> 01:11:47.607
boobies.

01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:54.353
I find her myself.

01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:56.921
You lot, don'’t move.

01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:02.492
Oh! You can'’t.

01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:05.712
Because I have the keys
to the van.

01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:12.589
I could probably
just hot-wire it anyway,

01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:14.721
-if you want me to.
-Oh, shut up.

01:12:14.721 --> 01:12:18.159
Anyways, I'’m not leaving
my sister with him.

01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:20.379
[Torval screams]

01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:22.033
Liz!

01:12:22.033 --> 01:12:23.948
Liz--

01:12:23.948 --> 01:12:25.645
-Liz?
-[growls]

01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:28.953
-Alex, no, don'’t go in there.
-[Torval groans]

01:12:28.953 --> 01:12:32.260
Since when was my sister
a zombie?

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:35.089
Well, that'’s what
we all want to know.

01:12:35.089 --> 01:12:39.006
No James, don'’t, we need
the keys to the van, remember?

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:41.052
She'’s my friend guys.
I'’ll do it.

01:12:41.052 --> 01:12:44.708
-[snarls]
-She won'’t hurt me.

[Liz growls,
flesh squishing]

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.320
Liz?

01:12:51.018 --> 01:12:54.239
It'’s your friend, Zar.
Remember?

01:12:55.893 --> 01:12:58.330
[growls]

01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:59.592
Oh, fuck.

01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:00.898
[flesh squishing]

01:13:04.902 --> 01:13:07.426
Liz...

01:13:07.426 --> 01:13:09.776
we had some good times,
didn'’t we?

01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:14.651
Ayia Napa.

01:13:14.651 --> 01:13:16.043
Magaluf.

01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:21.048
[voice breaks]
Even that time in Skegness.

01:13:27.054 --> 01:13:30.449
Liz, I need you to move.

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:32.190
I need to get those keys.

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:33.713
[hisses]

01:13:33.713 --> 01:13:38.588
Liz, I really don'’t want
to do this.

01:13:38.588 --> 01:13:40.024
Liz?

01:13:40.024 --> 01:13:42.243
[roars]

01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:43.375
[shotgun fires]

01:13:55.256 --> 01:13:56.910
[snarling distantly]

01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:05.397
All right, guys,
we need to get to that van.

01:14:05.397 --> 01:14:08.661
Yeah, sorry, who died
and put you in charge?

01:14:08.661 --> 01:14:12.012
No, yeah, fair enough.
I'’m sorry about that, mate.

01:14:12.012 --> 01:14:14.145
I didn'’t think
that through, that'’s--

01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:17.017
As I was saying, I'’ve got
the keys so I'’m driving.

01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:19.237
-Yeah, shotgun?
-[Zara] What do you mean?

01:14:19.237 --> 01:14:21.326
It doesn'’t matter
who sits where.

01:14:21.326 --> 01:14:23.197
No, you dumb bitch.
Just give me the shotgun.

01:14:23.197 --> 01:14:24.547
Oh, here take it.
I don'’t want it.

01:14:24.547 --> 01:14:26.940
Jim, the moment
you'’ve been waiting for.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.640
You'’ve got the gun.
Now fucking shoot '’em!

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.337
All right, now what you
guys wanna think about here

01:14:32.337 --> 01:14:34.731
is it'’s very important to keep
the butt of the gun tight

01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:36.646
to your shoulder, otherwise
you'’ll do yourself an injury.

01:14:36.646 --> 01:14:38.299
-James!
-All right, fucking hell.

01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:40.476
[trigger clicks]

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:42.608
James, I thought you said
you knew what you were doing!

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.741
Fucking Ellie,
for fuck'’s sake!

01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:47.439
-[Alex] For fuck'’s sake!
-For God'’s sake, just shoot!

01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:48.701
Pull!

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:53.663
Oh, shit, no, what are
the chances of that?

01:14:53.663 --> 01:14:55.839
There'’s literally
no way that could happen.

01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:57.667
-It just did!
-As if a bullet

01:14:57.667 --> 01:14:59.538
-would actually ignite--
-[Zara screams]

01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:03.586
Oh, my God!!
My fucking leg!

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:05.588
Look what you did
to my fucking leg!

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:08.591
-You motherfucker!
-Should we go back inside?

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:12.029
So this is it.
Our last stand.

01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:14.727
Except some of us
can'’t actually stand.

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:17.077
-Oh, my fucking leg you--
-Gimme that!

01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:19.079
We'’re gonna go out fighting!

01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:21.647
Be my guest,
I'’ve used that shell anyway.

01:15:21.647 --> 01:15:24.041
[car horn blares, thump]

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:25.695
[tires screech]

01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:27.566
[hip hop music]

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:37.489
Any of you cats
order a rescue?

01:15:37.489 --> 01:15:38.969
[yelps]

01:15:49.196 --> 01:15:51.198
[Az] What the fuck did
you guys do to that?

01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:00.512
So we going to the airport
then, yeah?

01:16:00.512 --> 01:16:02.383
Airport'’s closed.

01:16:02.383 --> 01:16:04.255
The whole island
is in quarantine.

01:16:04.255 --> 01:16:05.430
So where are we going?

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:07.127
Chill guys.

01:16:07.127 --> 01:16:09.303
We got the keys to a yacht.

01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:11.784
It'’s anchored
a few miles offshore.

01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:14.700
We get on that, and then we sail
back to the mainland.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.093
Yeah, that all sounds great,
but if it'’s offshore,

01:16:16.093 --> 01:16:17.747
how are we gonna
get there?

01:16:17.747 --> 01:16:19.531
Some of us haven'’t got
the use of all of our limbs,

01:16:19.531 --> 01:16:21.446
and I'’m pretty sure
I only got my 200-meter

01:16:21.446 --> 01:16:23.361
swimming badge out of pity.

01:16:23.361 --> 01:16:26.886
There'’s loads of speedboats
and jet skis at this beach.

01:16:26.886 --> 01:16:28.540
Sounds like you got
it all figured out.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.063
Where'’d you get all
this cool shit from, anyway?

01:16:30.063 --> 01:16:33.806
Well, it'’s a pretty
amazing story, actually.

01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:36.417
-Oh, my fuck--
-Shh!

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:38.245
[zombies growling]

01:16:48.821 --> 01:16:50.170
[car alarm beeps]

01:17:06.099 --> 01:17:09.799
Okay, you distract them.
I run to the car.

01:17:09.799 --> 01:17:12.236
No, no.
You distract them.

01:17:12.236 --> 01:17:17.023
I mean, you are more...
distracting.

01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:19.635
Do you know how to drive
a limo?

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:20.984
Hmm?

01:17:20.984 --> 01:17:23.639
Do you know
how to drive a limo?

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:24.857
No.

01:17:24.857 --> 01:17:26.729
See?

01:17:26.729 --> 01:17:29.645
If we get on that car,

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.472
you see that backseat?

01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:33.083
-Mm-hmm.
-Uh-huh?

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:37.087
I gonna ride you
like a mechanical bull.

01:17:37.087 --> 01:17:39.350
-Hmm?
-[chuckles]

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.438
Run, then.

01:17:45.835 --> 01:17:48.664
Come on, do something.

01:17:49.882 --> 01:17:51.841
Uh, hi.

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:53.756
Zombies.

01:17:53.756 --> 01:17:58.108
Um, I'’m Az from London.

01:17:58.108 --> 01:17:59.849
England.

01:17:59.849 --> 01:18:01.807
Uh, as you can see,

01:18:01.807 --> 01:18:05.376
there'’s not a lot
of meat on me.

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:07.117
Some noise, huh?

01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:10.642
It'’s not working!
Nobody ever listens to me!

01:18:13.819 --> 01:18:14.690
Yes!

01:18:19.564 --> 01:18:21.522
No. Maria?!

01:18:23.263 --> 01:18:26.136
Maria!
I ain'’t got a plan B!

01:19:04.565 --> 01:19:07.525
Let'’s go, let'’s go,
let'’s go, let'’s go, let'’s go.

01:19:07.525 --> 01:19:10.136
[tires screech]

01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:11.964
Yeah, cool story, bro,
but you haven'’t been through

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:14.184
what we'’ve been through--
I'’ve loved and I'’ve lost.

01:19:14.184 --> 01:19:17.578
-My sister'’s dead.
-Liz is dead?

01:19:17.578 --> 01:19:18.754
How?

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.233
Shotgun to the kisser.

01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:22.932
It might just be me
being stupid,

01:19:22.932 --> 01:19:26.849
but I don'’t get how Liz
turned in the first place.

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:28.981
Was it the zombie
in the pool?

01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:31.375
No, I checked
her entire body,

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:33.333
and there was
no sign of scratches.

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.379
She must have swallowed
some blood in the pool.

01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:37.033
She'’s right.

01:19:37.033 --> 01:19:39.296
It doesn'’t
just have to be a bite.

01:19:39.296 --> 01:19:41.864
There'’s loads of ways
you can get infected.

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:44.997
Transfer of blood,
you know, unprotected sex.

01:19:44.997 --> 01:19:47.957
Should have read
the leaflets, guys.

01:19:47.957 --> 01:19:51.525
So, yeah, Jim,
if you did sleep with my sister,

01:19:51.525 --> 01:19:53.745
you'’re infected, too.

01:19:53.745 --> 01:19:55.921
But you didn'’t.
So you'’re not.

01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:59.011
What?
Jim slept with your sister?

01:20:03.146 --> 01:20:05.888
Ow, watch it!

01:20:05.888 --> 01:20:08.412
Right guys,
let'’s get to the beach.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:23.035
So... all we have to do
is get through them.

01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:24.645
[zombies growling]

01:20:27.387 --> 01:20:29.563
Uh, yeah.

01:20:29.563 --> 01:20:32.697
[snarling]

01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:35.918
That'’s, uh,
quite a lot of zombies.

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:37.528
Not too many
we can'’t handle, though.

01:21:09.516 --> 01:21:12.389
Oh, for fuck-- use the machete,
not my fucking--

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:13.912
Slice him,
just slice him with the--

01:21:13.912 --> 01:21:17.046
[both shouting]

01:21:27.491 --> 01:21:29.754
Go have a shower,
bitch!

01:21:32.278 --> 01:21:33.323
Yeah.

01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:39.503
Whoa! Then use them!
[grunts]

01:21:39.503 --> 01:21:43.507
Ow! You fucking retard!
I have a machete!

01:21:43.507 --> 01:21:45.726
[both shouting]

01:22:03.657 --> 01:22:05.877
Ellie, did you see--

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:16.192
Right now, we need--

01:22:16.192 --> 01:22:18.890
Ow! That was my bad leg!

01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:20.761
Oh, another fucking retard!

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.992
Az,
this isn'’t a jet ski.

01:22:33.992 --> 01:22:36.473
Well, it should
still get us there.

01:22:36.473 --> 01:22:38.040
Maybe.

01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:43.393
Hey, less talk,
more pedaling. [claps]

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:50.574
I'’m, uh-- this is it,
guys, game over.

01:22:50.574 --> 01:22:52.315
What are you talking about?
We'’re nearly there.

01:22:52.315 --> 01:22:55.448
No, man, it'’s the end for me.
I don'’t feel well.

01:22:55.448 --> 01:22:58.016
I'’m-- I'’m infected.
I'’m just gonna stay here.

01:22:58.016 --> 01:23:00.845
It'’s just that crusty kebab
you had, you idiot.

01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:02.499
No mate, I--
I fucked your sister.

01:23:02.499 --> 01:23:04.066
I had sex with her.
I ran through her. I--

01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:07.243
-You didn'’t fuck my sister.
-I did.

01:23:07.243 --> 01:23:08.766
-You didn'’t.
-I did.

01:23:08.766 --> 01:23:10.942
We swapped fluids, Alex.
We swapped fluids.

01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:13.249
Okay, sorted.
You'’re staying here.

01:23:13.249 --> 01:23:15.686
The rest of you,
get the fuck back on this thing.

01:23:15.686 --> 01:23:19.037
Really, Jim.
You'’re not coming with us?

01:23:22.084 --> 01:23:23.259
See you later, Jim.

01:23:26.523 --> 01:23:27.959
Gonna miss you, man.

01:23:31.919 --> 01:23:35.184
-Crazy Spanish lady.
-Brazilian, prick.

01:23:35.184 --> 01:23:38.274
Yeah, I, mean,
it looked like at one stage,

01:23:38.274 --> 01:23:41.842
you and I might have a thing,
but obviously I had Liz,

01:23:41.842 --> 01:23:44.323
and she was always
my number-one priority,

01:23:44.323 --> 01:23:46.108
and normally what I'’d do is,

01:23:46.108 --> 01:23:48.501
I'’d fuck
both of you simultaneously.

01:23:48.501 --> 01:23:50.460
You on a Monday,
her on a Tuesday.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:53.985
Hey, bitch, just turn into
a fucking zombie so we can go.

01:23:53.985 --> 01:23:57.032
[Jim] Ellie.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:24:00.774
Look after Alex for me, will ya?
He'’s probably--

01:24:00.774 --> 01:24:03.690
he loves you, so you should
probably take him back.

01:24:03.690 --> 01:24:08.260
Okay, James.
You... look after yourself.

01:24:16.007 --> 01:24:18.444
And I wanted to let you know,

01:24:18.444 --> 01:24:20.403
I don'’t actually think
you'’re that boring.

01:24:20.403 --> 01:24:23.667
You'’ve actually been mildly
interesting on this holiday,

01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:25.625
and sometimes I'’ve even
been thinking about you.

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:28.150
Not sexually or anything,
but just how are you?

01:24:28.150 --> 01:24:30.978
-Hope you'’re safe
and stuff like that, so.
-Thanks.

01:24:33.372 --> 01:24:36.462
Alex, man, it'’s been good,
but you know,

01:24:36.462 --> 01:24:38.421
we just ran outta steam
on the home stretch like--

01:24:38.421 --> 01:24:40.423
like the bobsled
in Cool Runnings

01:24:40.423 --> 01:24:42.686
who ended up losing
to the Germans,

01:24:42.686 --> 01:24:44.427
but there'’s no shame
in that cause they'’re

01:24:44.427 --> 01:24:46.646
the best in the world
at the end of the day.

01:24:46.646 --> 01:24:48.083
You'’re serious?

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:49.954
-Yeah, deadly serious.
-Well...

01:24:51.695 --> 01:24:53.436
Do you want us
to kill you now?

01:24:53.436 --> 01:24:55.177
I'’ll do it.
I'’ll do it.

01:24:55.177 --> 01:24:56.743
Well, before you turn,
you know?

01:24:56.743 --> 01:24:58.658
I think
I'’m just gonna see what

01:24:58.658 --> 01:25:00.747
life'’s like as a zombie,
you know?

01:25:00.747 --> 01:25:03.402
We really
appreciate this, James,

01:25:03.402 --> 01:25:06.144
but if you could hurry up?

01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:07.232
Yeah.

01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:11.976
[Zara]
Thank fuck for that.

01:25:11.976 --> 01:25:14.196
I thought it was gonna
fucking take all day.

01:25:14.196 --> 01:25:15.110
Let'’s go.

01:25:18.504 --> 01:25:22.334
That'’s it guys, you go.
Save yourselves.

01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:24.945
Everyone just hold on!

01:25:24.945 --> 01:25:27.426
Woo-hoo!

01:25:27.426 --> 01:25:28.732
[zombies snarling]

01:25:31.256 --> 01:25:33.258
Tell the world
about what you'’ve seen here

01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:35.826
and the atrocities,
and also remember

01:25:35.826 --> 01:25:39.134
the sea has no backdoor.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.614
Godspeed. Godspeed.

01:26:08.815 --> 01:26:11.296
Hey, big man! Drink?

01:26:11.296 --> 01:26:13.646
Jesus Christ, man,
you scared me.

01:26:13.646 --> 01:26:15.300
You look like
a piña colada man.

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:18.042
No, no, there'’s a beach
full of zombies back there.

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:20.479
And I'’m feeling ill myself.
I'’m probably gonna turn, too.

01:26:20.479 --> 01:26:22.438
You should get out of here.
Just head for the hills.

01:26:22.438 --> 01:26:24.440
Chill. Chill.

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.224
Nothing you can do about now,
is there?

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:28.531
Jesus, I'’m sorry to see that.
That'’s really bad.

01:26:28.531 --> 01:26:32.143
Pull up a stool.
What'’s your story?

01:26:32.143 --> 01:26:35.277
I, uh...
I had sex with a zombie.

01:26:35.277 --> 01:26:37.844
[laughs]
You had sex with a zombie,

01:26:37.844 --> 01:26:39.455
you dirty dog.

01:26:39.455 --> 01:26:41.500
No, she wasn'’t a zombie
when I had sex,

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:43.502
she was still human,
but obviously,

01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:45.722
-she was infected and stuff.
-Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:26:45.722 --> 01:26:48.028
Well, what,
was she a girlfriend, or?

01:26:48.028 --> 01:26:50.901
No, I wish.

01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:53.208
She was
my best mate'’s sister.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.122
But I'’d always fancied her,
so.

01:26:55.122 --> 01:26:59.039
I'’ve got a--
actually, I can show you.

01:26:59.039 --> 01:27:01.477
Nice.

01:27:01.477 --> 01:27:03.174
[chuckles appreciatively]

01:27:03.174 --> 01:27:06.308
That is one nice bottom,
my friend.

01:27:06.308 --> 01:27:08.266
Yeah, well, I mean,
don'’t kid yourself,

01:27:08.266 --> 01:27:11.400
she wanted it just as much
as I did, so.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.577
Ah, what'’s the--
what'’s the point?

01:27:14.577 --> 01:27:17.101
No point anymore.
I didn'’t even have sex with her.

01:27:17.101 --> 01:27:18.755
But you just said you did
have sex with her.

01:27:18.755 --> 01:27:21.714
Yeah, I know,
but she wanted to, and...

01:27:21.714 --> 01:27:25.327
[sighs] she took her top off,
put her hand on my leg,

01:27:25.327 --> 01:27:27.851
and that was it,
it was-- it was all over, man.

01:27:27.851 --> 01:27:30.245
I didn'’t-- I didn'’t even get
the chance to take off my pants.

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:33.160
Ooh, ah, well,
don'’t worry about it.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.380
I mean, you know,
it could happen to anyone.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:36.860
Really, has it
ever happened to you?

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:40.167
No. Not me.

01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:42.561
[sighs]

01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:45.260
So anyway, if you didn'’t
have sex with her,

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.174
how come you'’re so sure
you'’re gonna be infected?

01:27:47.174 --> 01:27:48.785
Well, I bloody kissed her,
didn'’t I?

01:27:48.785 --> 01:27:51.135
It'’s all bodily fluids
at the end of the day, so.

01:27:51.135 --> 01:27:53.268
You haven'’t been reading
the leaflets, have you, fella?

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:55.487
Here, look.

[upbeat tropical music
on speakers]

01:28:07.673 --> 01:28:10.372
-So I'’m not infected?
-No, of course not.

01:28:10.372 --> 01:28:11.982
Not from a bit
of saliva swapping.

01:28:11.982 --> 01:28:15.159
I thought everybody
knew that.

01:28:15.159 --> 01:28:18.336
I'’m not infected?

01:28:18.336 --> 01:28:20.382
I'’m not infected!

01:28:20.382 --> 01:28:22.688
I'’m not infected!
Yes!

01:28:25.169 --> 01:28:27.389
Fuck, I'’m not infected.

01:28:27.389 --> 01:28:29.086
I'’m not infected, fuck!

You okay, Alex?

01:29:27.405 --> 01:29:29.538
Yeah. I'’m okay.

01:29:31.757 --> 01:29:34.499
Liz isn'’t.

01:29:34.499 --> 01:29:37.459
Jim isn'’t.

01:29:37.459 --> 01:29:38.895
I'’ve got no one left.

01:29:38.895 --> 01:29:41.201
I'’m here.

01:29:41.201 --> 01:29:44.161
Me and you back together?

01:29:44.161 --> 01:29:47.730
Well it was Big Jim'’s
dying wish, after all.

01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:51.298
Things can'’t just go back
to how they were,

01:29:51.298 --> 01:29:53.039
not after everything
that'’s happened.

01:29:53.039 --> 01:29:55.868
But everything that'’s happened
has made me realize

01:29:55.868 --> 01:29:57.653
how much I care about you.

01:29:57.653 --> 01:30:01.483
I know,
and I care about you, too.

01:30:01.483 --> 01:30:04.007
But things have changed.

01:30:04.007 --> 01:30:06.923
I'’ve changed.
We all have.

01:30:10.317 --> 01:30:14.104
Look, Alex,
what I'’m saying is,

01:30:14.104 --> 01:30:17.063
I'’m glad you came
to save me.

01:30:17.063 --> 01:30:18.891
Even if, you know,
it was actually me

01:30:18.891 --> 01:30:20.676
that saved you in the end.

01:30:20.676 --> 01:30:23.374
Well, it'’s the thought
that counts, right?

01:30:23.374 --> 01:30:26.377
Yeah, I suppose it is.

01:30:26.377 --> 01:30:28.510
So, yeah.

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:33.776
When we get home,
we can give it another go.

01:30:33.776 --> 01:30:37.257
But if you fuck up again,
I'’ll stab you in the ear, right?

01:30:37.257 --> 01:30:38.781
Right. [chuckles]

01:30:38.781 --> 01:30:40.391
Right.

01:30:40.391 --> 01:30:42.349
[Karl]
Oh, how terribly sweet.

01:30:45.483 --> 01:30:48.094
Oh, look,
a steps reunion.

01:30:48.094 --> 01:30:50.619
So...

01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:56.189
which one of you meddlesome kids
has the key to my boat, hmm?

01:30:59.018 --> 01:31:00.759
Or is it you?

01:31:00.759 --> 01:31:03.893
You skanky street dog.

01:31:03.893 --> 01:31:07.418

-Bitch!
Oh, charming.

01:31:14.773 --> 01:31:18.647
How about you?
You little cock tease.

01:31:20.518 --> 01:31:21.954
Have you got my keys?

01:31:21.954 --> 01:31:26.568
If we give you the keys,
will you let us go?

01:31:26.568 --> 01:31:29.527
What'’s say I let you
have my speedboat.

01:31:29.527 --> 01:31:31.573
Hmm?

01:31:31.573 --> 01:31:34.053
And you can take your chances
with the sharks.

01:31:34.053 --> 01:31:36.578
-The sharks?
-Yes, you see,

01:31:36.578 --> 01:31:38.405
they don'’t normally come
this close to shore,

01:31:38.405 --> 01:31:41.539
but right now the sea'’s
full of walking corpses.

01:31:41.539 --> 01:31:44.673
Anyway,
enough of this chitchat.

01:31:44.673 --> 01:31:46.892
No, don'’t shoot her, please.

01:31:46.892 --> 01:31:49.286
-No!
-Here, take your keys.

01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:53.203
Thanks, cupcake.

01:31:53.203 --> 01:31:56.467
Now, why don'’t you all form
a queue or something.

01:31:56.467 --> 01:31:59.601
-It'’ll make you easier to shoot.
-You said you'’d let us go.

01:31:59.601 --> 01:32:04.301
Well, I say a lot of things,
sunbeam. [chuckles]

01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:08.087
Did you really think I was gonna
let you have my speedboat?

01:32:08.087 --> 01:32:10.916
Just a second.
Who the fuck are you?

01:32:12.918 --> 01:32:14.790
Some cheap champagne?

01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:17.967
Yeah, talking of cheap.

01:32:17.967 --> 01:32:20.056
Go and join your friends.

01:32:26.062 --> 01:32:27.890

this is gonna be fun.

[Rupert] You, Kenan and Kel
with the three bars, you call.

01:33:34.565 --> 01:33:37.046
Right,
that is both offensive

01:33:37.046 --> 01:33:39.962
and quite possibly racist
and--

01:33:39.962 --> 01:33:42.355
but given the predicament
we find ourselves in,

01:33:42.355 --> 01:33:43.922
I'’m not gonna retaliate
and say that I think

01:33:43.922 --> 01:33:45.184
you look like one
of the Thunderbirds

01:33:45.184 --> 01:33:46.969
with your long head
or anything,

01:33:46.969 --> 01:33:50.015

and call an ambulance.

that we were at a nightclub
that turned into a--

Absolutely rubbish.

to go through me first.

Oh, don'’t worry,
I was planning to.

Do you mean
in a gay way?

Yes, I do.

-Cut.

I know what you'’re thinking--
but, Jim,

01:34:21.699 --> 01:34:23.658
I thought you were a player
and I didn'’t know you wanted

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:25.529
to get tied down
to just one bitch,

01:34:25.529 --> 01:34:27.531
and, yes, ordinarily,
you'’d be right.

01:34:27.531 --> 01:34:29.054
Normally what I'’d do is,

01:34:29.054 --> 01:34:31.578
I'’d fuck both
of you simultaneously.
