WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.498
(techno music)

00:07.591 --> 00:10.458
I never got why people would
spend Saturday night lining up.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.796
What, you kidding me?

00:11.845 --> 00:14.632
A sick DJ, a packed dance floor,
beautiful women.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.172
And that could be us right now,
if we'd chosen different paths.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.427
No way, man. Not me.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.968
I mean, I'd probably be working
construction at Timmons,

00:21.021 --> 00:22.977
married to Denise,
baby on the way.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.607
Yeah, but you're not, because
we decided to serve, protect,

00:26.652 --> 00:28.813
and cruise around looking awesome.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.320
(chuckles) Yeah. Yes.
Yes, we did.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.529
1:30 in the morning,
there's still a lineup.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.984
I never had to line up.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.790
All I did was flash my smile,
show my fake ID,

00:42.834 --> 00:45.291
and it was, "Pull that rope aside,
Mr. Bouncer, please."

00:45.337 --> 00:46.952
— Come on.
— (Traci chuckles)

00:47.005 --> 00:52.216
Now it's mac and cheese,
"Finding Nemo," and bed by 9:30.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.712
I know.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.882
— I love that movie.
— (Traci chuckles)

00:56.974 --> 00:59.386
(dispatcher on radio) All units, we have
a disturbance at 2480 Richmond,

00:59.518 --> 01:02.385
Vestibule nightclub.
An officer is involved.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.854
All right. Light 'em up.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.816
(siren wails)

01:13.865 --> 01:16.197
— Noooo!
— (Chris) Dispatch said officer involved.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.325
— Get off him now!
— Where's the officer?

01:18.370 --> 01:19.485
— I don't know, but we're here now.
— Hey! Police! That's enough!

01:19.538 --> 01:21.199
Hey! Hey!

01:21.248 --> 01:22.738
All right!
Everyone just calm down!

01:22.833 --> 01:25.040
— Try it on me.
— She started it!

01:25.085 --> 01:28.202
Hey! Pepper spray, anybody? Huh?

01:28.255 --> 01:30.541
Who wants to spend a night
in the pokey?

01:30.591 --> 01:31.831
Johnny. Stop it.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.374
Because rounding up
a bunch of drunks like y'all

01:34.428 --> 01:36.214
reminds me why I love my job!

01:36.263 --> 01:37.503
Check for weapons, injuries.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.217
Come here.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.052
Yeah, you're gonna want
to get some ice on that.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.011
— Yeah.
— Yeah.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.517
All right. Hey, sunshine!
You're coming with me!

01:45.272 --> 01:47.433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:50.902 --> 01:54.235
— I'll start with her.
— 'Course you will. Let's go.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.109
(man gasping, gagging)

02:05.375 --> 02:06.581
Hey.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.077
Uh, this is Officer Diaz.
l'm downstairs.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.917
Call EMS.
I've got a possible OD.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.378
Hey. Come on, buddy.
Stay with me.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.463
(siren wailing)

02:17.554 --> 02:18.714
You sure you're up to this?

02:18.764 --> 02:21.881
Yeah, of course.
Um, I actually kind of think it's cool.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.553
You know, it's like a do—over.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.593
You're putting away a bad guy
who got away with it six years ago.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.978
(man on tape) I'm not saying any more,
scum bucket.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.272
That would be Nero Musconi,
suspected hit man,

02:30.317 --> 02:33.400
but thanks to new DNA evidence,
soon—to—be—convicted hit man.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.482
Yeah, guy spit on the body
after he popped him. Classy.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.234
So what do l have to do, exactly?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.490
Just listen to the tapes,
make sure our notes line up.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.818
Yeah, we've been over it so many times,
we need a new perspective.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.074
Just make sure it makes sense
to somebody who wasn't there.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.079
Look, I love you for doing this.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.662
Yeah, though I promise you,
by the end of it, you will be saying...

02:49.753 --> 02:52.165
(Musconi on tape) I'm not saying any more,
scum bucket.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.799
(indistinct conversations,
telephones ringing)

03:01.848 --> 03:04.305
How's your Saturday night, McNally?

03:04.351 --> 03:06.012
Oh, just working a murder case...

03:06.520 --> 03:07.600
with Luke and Jo.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.978
Was their last big case
before he came to 15.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.979
Yeah, they were quite a team.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.356
lguess.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.272
So what are you doing, exactly?

03:16.321 --> 03:19.154
— Uh, just double—checking, you know.
— Mm—hmm.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.860
(Gail) I found a baby.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.987
— What?
— No, I did.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.322
In the middle of High Park.
This woman called it in,

03:25.372 --> 03:27.829
said she was walking her dog
and she heard it crying.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.535
Swarek held it
while I took her statement.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.036
You held a baby?

03:31.128 --> 03:34.495
Uh, no, |, uh, took down a purse snatcher,
two drunk drivers,

03:34.548 --> 03:37.005
and a streaking engineer student,
then I held a baby.

03:38.802 --> 03:39.837
Know what? I should go.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.342
Lot of bad guys out there, McNally.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.003
You sure you want to be
doing papenNork?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.466
Well, they need me.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.882
And Luke asked me to, so...

03:46.977 --> 03:49.059
Your call. Enjoy.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.642
(chatter, dance music)

03:52.691 --> 03:55.524
Dispatch said there was
an officer involved.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.854
That would be you, Nash?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.728
I don't see any other uniforms.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.189
Oh, no. Look at this.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.198
Tell me you're not gonna
shut this place down.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.828
Your staff's assaulting its customers
tends to be bad for business.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.411
Yeah. They left 7 bucks on a $90 tab.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.162
What, that's a——that's a bad tip?

04:13.211 --> 04:16.169
Yeah, look who I'm talking to,
huh? Hmm?

04:16.214 --> 04:17.829
(both chuckle)

04:17.883 --> 04:20.090
Aw, good to see you, partner.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.008
"Officer involved,"
I should have known.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.009
Had to say something to get
your lazy ass to show up.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.215
Didn't I, huh?
How are you?

04:26.433 --> 04:27.923
(Noelle) Ooh!

04:29.269 --> 04:30.725
(Oliver)
Traci Nash, Patrick Murphy.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.386
Pleasure.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.226
— She was your waitress?
— She literally threw the tip at us

04:35.275 --> 04:37.561
— and then started shoving me——
— Yeah, the crazy bitch, she goes nuts.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.351
She pulls out some of my hair.
Write that down, buddy.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.395
— (Dov) One at a time.
— "Pulls out some of the victim's hair."

04:41.448 --> 04:43.063
One at a time.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.736
You two reside
at the same address?

04:45.786 --> 04:46.775
— (exhales)
— (Traci) Excuse us.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.736
Oliver says to make this go away.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.906
Disperse everyone.
No one comes back to the Barn.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.574
— Doesn't want anyone pressing charges.
— But Chris got punched.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.619
You know how they said
there was an officer involved?

04:56.713 --> 04:58.419
It's the owner. He's an ex—cop.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.796
He's a friend of theirs
from the Academy.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.254
All right, here's the deal.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.218
You want to press charges,
you got to come back to my division.

05:08.266 --> 05:09.597
That could take a long time.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.634
There's gonna be court dates...

05:11.728 --> 05:13.434
Buddy,no.
I want that skank arrested.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.266
I want her charged.
I want it done now.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.306
— That you don't want to do.
— Johnny——

05:17.400 --> 05:18.810
— Let me do this.
— Oh——ow.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.893
— Let her go.
— Oh, yeah?

05:20.946 --> 05:22.436
Let her go now.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.480
Excuse me.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.951
I hear one of my waitresses
started all this.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.777
She's been fired,
so how about | make it up to you?

05:29.830 --> 05:32.287
Open tab, rest of the night?
Cool?

05:33.291 --> 05:34.155
Yeah.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.079
Have a good night, officer.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.630
(police radio chatter)

05:42.676 --> 05:44.632
(Frank) Your club has a drug problem.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.795
I know, but you can't shut me down.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.840
It took me years to get the club where
the kids actually show up. Come on.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.141
Well, if it wasn't for one of 15's finest,

05:53.186 --> 05:54.847
one of those kids would have OD'd.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.519
I know, and I appreciate it.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.686
Thank you, sir.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.810
Here's what I'll do. I'll put a bouncer
in both bathrooms,

05:59.860 --> 06:01.270
hire a few extra guys
to work the floor.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.777
Not enough. We've had nine complaints
about Vestibule in the past year.

06:04.823 --> 06:08.281
And what's worse?
I heard that from a reporter.

06:08.326 --> 06:11.784
She quite sanely asked why 15 Division's
never done anything

06:11.830 --> 06:13.491
about the drugs spewing out of your club.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.120
I told her anything she reported would
jeopardize our ongoing investigation.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.124
Okay. You're right. It's a problem.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.671
I got a snitch in clubland.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.377
No C.l.s. Nothing complicated.
I want this fast, simple.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.331
I'll make it simple.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.966
Put me undercover.
l'll bust the dealer.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.968
Uaughs)

06:29.014 --> 06:30.174
— What?
— Yeah, Ollie, right.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.179
You gonna try to slide your gut
into a pair of skinny jeans,

06:34.352 --> 06:37.219
Well, anybody got any better ideas?
I'm all ears. Come on.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.308
You fired that waitress last night.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.392
Yes.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.852
Yeah. Send McNally in.
She can do it.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.645
And, uh, and Peck.
Send 'em both in.

06:49.993 --> 06:51.529
—Target.
— (click)

06:51.578 --> 06:53.569
(giggles) Do we have earpieces?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.699
Nah, no point. We're not gonna
be able to hear you.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.206
Music'll be too loud,
but we'll be right across the street,

06:58.251 --> 07:00.207
and you will have...
(beeping)

07:00.253 --> 07:01.333
Uh, can I trade you?

07:02.255 --> 07:04.541
— Fine.
— Okay. (chuckles)

07:05.759 --> 07:07.715
You will have... these.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.377
Personal cell phones stay here.
These are clean.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.671
Got a tiny little mic.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.680
In case you get lucky,
push this button right here

07:14.726 --> 07:16.216
and we'll pick it up.
Plus, they got a camera, okay?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.055
A phone with a camera in it.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.595
That's great. Unbelievably cool.
I... all right.

07:20.690 --> 07:24.353
Figure out who's dealing.
Get pictures, audio if you can.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.779
— And what's the most important thing?
— Success.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.945
— Sensible shoes.
— What?

07:29.032 --> 07:29.896
Make it real.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.111
You're not pretending to be waitresses——

07:32.202 --> 07:33.112
You are waitresses.

07:33.203 --> 07:36.445
Like, what he said, so...
tell the truth whenever you can,

07:36.539 --> 07:37.619
or close to it.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.915
You and Jo are done with me, right?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.622
Yeah, no, it's up to us now.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.703
Means a weekend of
all Nero Musconi all the time,

07:44.756 --> 07:47.964
but hey, be safe, drink coffee,
make good tips.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.962
— We need a new sofa.
— Sounds good.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.213
[pat on bottom]

07:51.721 --> 07:52.801
Augh. Oof.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.720
What's the matter?

07:54.766 --> 07:56.597
| just don't usually take it like this.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.053
Oh, maybe it wasn't for you.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.886
The one undercover job
that I'm perfect for,

08:00.939 --> 08:03.601
and I can't do it 'cause I got burned
at the location last night.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.936
Andy and Gail don't even know
from waitressing.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.476
She keeps saying to me
it's gonna be easy.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.480
And you do know?

08:08.571 --> 08:11.278
The fast—food goddess
till I was old enough to schlep drinks.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.610
Well, you're right. Working an operation
like this is a good thing,

08:13.660 --> 08:14.991
especially if you want
to make detective.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.238
(Jerry) That's my point exactly.
(Oliver) Jerry, listen.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.493
(Jo) Follow me.
(Oliver) Jerry, you put me on this thing, okay?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.241
Patrick's a buddy.
You put me in as a customer.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.417
You can't go there.
You were already at the scene.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.323
— Jerry——
— Just one sec.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.784
You know how these drug cases get.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.828
They get tossed out
for the slightest thing.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.833
— Come on.
— What?

08:27.924 --> 08:30.461
Officer Nash here's spent
some time serving bar.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.466
She knows club life.
You should take her.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.301
Yeah, fine. Good.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.687
I take it you two used to date?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.641
Uh, when you say date, um...

08:44.691 --> 08:47.808
Lots of crazy sex, lakeshore motels,
interrogation rooms?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.601
You are good.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.195
(groans) You know,
the nurse said it wasn't broken,

08:53.283 --> 08:54.864
but it sure feels like it.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.033
Why do women always date
douchebags?

08:57.120 --> 08:57.984
What, instead of you?

08:58.038 --> 09:01.030
No, instead of anyone who's not
a complete aggro meathead.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.831
It's probably a pheromone thing.
Can't let it get to you.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.162
(keystrokes)
I knew it. Guy's in the system.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.497
Two assault charges,
one brought by a woman.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.457
Do you think she knows?

09:08.506 --> 09:09.461
Who are we talking about?

09:09.507 --> 09:13.045
Beatrice, girl from last night.
I... I got to tell her.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.548
No. No, you don't.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.015
— Did you see that guy?
— Yeah, I also saw her.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.218
What's that supposed to mean?

09:20.310 --> 09:21.470
Look, Dov,

09:22.062 --> 09:24.053
people date the wrong people
all the time. Okay?

09:24.147 --> 09:26.559
And we can't do anything
about it until they call us.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.682
Oh, no.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.690
What's wrong?

09:29.736 --> 09:32.569
Oh, no. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna sneeze.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.490
Ah—choo!

09:34.532 --> 09:38.821
Aah! Aah...
Ow, ow, ow.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.995
Ice is in the walk—in.
Keep the bar bucket full.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.706
Soda's there...
sinks...

09:48.755 --> 09:51.212
kegs and wine are in the back,
by the office.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.417
Do we need a key?

09:52.926 --> 09:54.837
Back office is off—limits to new staff.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.384
And don't think you're fooling me
that you've done this before.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.344
I know exactly what's going on here.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.769
Which one of you's
sleeping with Patrick?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.730
We've got a 3—inch minimum.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.111
You're not working retail
at the mall, honey.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.565
— (Andy laughs)
— Shut your face.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.737
(Jerry) I don't like it.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.452
It doesn't matter if we can see
the front of the club.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.578
We can't hear anything.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.084
They're gonna be fine.
They can send us a message.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.792
Until she gets hit with a rush.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.964
My bet, we're sitting here
a few good shifts

10:35.051 --> 10:36.916
before they even begin
to get anywhere.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.551
(Sam) Sushi or Thai, anyone?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.882
Nash likes bulgogi.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.093
What the hell is bul... (babbles)

10:43.143 --> 10:45.759
Delicious Korean meat thing.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.393
There's a cart on Spadina.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.939
Hot dogs it is.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.147
(door slams)

11:04.497 --> 11:07.614
(exales loudly, clears throat)

11:13.840 --> 11:15.580
— H—How's Leo?
— Good.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.333
He's good.
He's starting grade one.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.009
— Grade one.
— He's great.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.461
Huh.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.928
Dating anybody?

11:25.977 --> 11:27.183
No.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.353
Be right back.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.192
Okay. One crantini,
uh, one wine——

11:40.283 --> 11:43.446
chardonnay, I think——
and three gin—and—tonics.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.989
Should I be asking for ID?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.781
— The Jameses do it at the door.
— Oh, okay.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.664
What? Both bouncers
are named James?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.541
Or maybe it's their last name,

11:52.629 --> 11:53.994
and, uh, they're married
and very traditional.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.537
Uaughs)

11:56.549 --> 12:00.838
Two vodka martinis, one dirty,
one with extra olives,

12:00.887 --> 12:01.876
two shots of tequila,

12:01.971 --> 12:04.838
and the guy over there wants something
called a Sunday sling?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.347
Tell him to talk to big James.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.386
Thank God it's a slow night.

12:08.478 --> 12:12.187
Oh, really? 'Cause for a Sunday,
this place is pretty rockin'.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.479
Who had the crantini?

12:20.531 --> 12:21.395
Me.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.191
— White wine?
— (woman) That's me.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.074
Hey, man.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.531
(knocks on door)

12:36.547 --> 12:38.208
Beatrice. Hi.
Sorry to bother you.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.668
Officer Epstein.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.209
Oh, hi. I didn't recognize you
without your uniform.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.675
Ah, yes. That's 'cause
I am not here as a cop.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.886
I'm just here as me.
Is, uh, Johnny home?

12:48.935 --> 12:49.890
Johnny's at work.

12:49.936 --> 12:50.846
Okay.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.760
| just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.689
l——l feel like things didn't get
handled properly last night.

12:56.734 --> 13:00.773
l was under orders to resolve things
quietly, and, anyway...

13:00.863 --> 13:04.196
Uh, I ran your boyfriend's name
through our computer.

13:04.242 --> 13:08.076
Does the name Emily Viner
mean anything to you?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.611
Johnny used to date her.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.748
Are you aware that
on two separate occasions,

13:13.793 --> 13:15.294
she called 911 on him?

13:20.466 --> 13:23.208
I think your boyfriend
has an anger issue.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.718
| just thought you should know.

13:25.763 --> 13:30.257
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to call.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.641
— Call?
— Us.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.434
The police.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.474
Have a good night.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.272
Hey.

13:39.569 --> 13:40.604
Thanks.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.618
Gonna be a long one?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.279
(sighs) Ah.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.618
Monthly reports.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.248
Figure I should read 'em
before I sign 'em.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.910
Well, heavy is the head
that wears the brass.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.464
(Frank chuckles)

14:00.506 --> 14:02.462
Hey, uh, Noelle.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.466
You know, uh,
Max Vermeer over in 22?

14:05.511 --> 14:08.503
(laughs) Yeah.
I drank him under the table

14:08.598 --> 14:10.509
at last year's charity
basketball tournament.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.841
As a matter of fact,
he still owes me 20 bucks.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.312
Oh, well, I ran into him last night.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.767
He's got an offer to go to Dubai.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.976
— Private security consultant.
— Nice.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.483
That means he can definitely
afford that 20 bucks.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.361
Well, that means that
a staff sergeant position

14:25.448 --> 14:27.029
will be opening up.
I think you should go for it.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.859
— Yeah, I don't know.
— Ah, come on.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.489
You know you want these stripes.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.789
I make 'em look good.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.789
Ah, true, true, but, uh, ljust...

14:36.834 --> 14:39.792
I got some things going on.
It's not a good time.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.124
Everything all right?

14:42.173 --> 14:44.380
— Yeah. It's great.
— Yeah?

14:44.467 --> 14:45.502
I mean...

14:45.551 --> 14:48.964
| just don't want to get stuck actually
having to read the stuff I sign.

14:49.013 --> 14:52.551
— But have fun. (laughs)
— All right.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.183
— Don't forget what I said.
— (Noelle) Mm—hmm.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.764
(techno music)

15:04.070 --> 15:05.901
You get better tips if you smile.

15:06.989 --> 15:09.025
One of my customers
asked for a Sunday sling.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.691
Tori said they were your specialty.
What is it?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.736
It's what you take Saturday night
that puts you in a sling Sunday.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.409
Good to know.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.497
(glasses clinking)

15:21.921 --> 15:25.004
Hey. I saw blue shirt
palm the bouncer some money.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.550
No product changed hands, though.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.707
Where'd he go?

15:27.760 --> 15:31.002
Uh... I don't know.
I must've lost him.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.386
There he is.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.923
Know what? I'm gonna go check
what's back there. Cover me.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.591
No, my tables.

15:37.687 --> 15:41.396
Okay, can——can | get another round
for table seven, please?

16:00.209 --> 16:01.710
Watch the bar for a sec.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.038
Wait, there's breaks?

16:04.088 --> 16:05.544
Not for you.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.798
(footsteps approach)

16:14.098 --> 16:16.931
— What the hell are you doing here?
— I came to see you.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.472
(Tori moans)

16:20.563 --> 16:24.476
— You should have waited at my place.
— Yeah, well, ljust got back into town...

16:24.567 --> 16:26.398
You don't call. You don't text.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.730
Three weeks.
I thought you were dead.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.565
| get scared
when I don't hear from you.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.731
Yeah, yeah.
I always come back to see you.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.991
If we can't deal
with the in—between time, then——

16:36.078 --> 16:37.113
I hate the in—betweens.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.950
Yeah. I was away.
I had to pick something up.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.456
Uh, some kid the other night
almost OD'd in here.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.460
— You have to be careful.
— But if this goes down, it's gonna be good.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.793
— Like, how good?
— Like, uh, 600k good.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.174
— And then that's it?
— Yeah.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.171
(Tori giggles)

16:53.262 --> 16:54.843
(unzipping)

16:54.931 --> 16:55.920
(man) That's it.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.180
(man moans)

16:58.267 --> 17:01.100
(kissing)

17:02.480 --> 17:04.016
(Tori moans)

17:15.868 --> 17:17.369
(police radio chatter)

17:17.453 --> 17:20.536
Okay, people.
What's going on with Vestibule?

17:20.623 --> 17:21.487
(Sam) McNally.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.328
Uh, well, last night I overheard
the bartender talking to her boyfriend,

17:24.377 --> 17:27.164
and he mentioned some deal
worth $600,000.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.953
Probably the main supply line.

17:29.006 --> 17:29.961
You get a name?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.872
Uh, we're——we're working on it.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.004
If we get an ID on this guy,

17:34.053 --> 17:35.884
we might be able to cut this off
at the source.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.382
(Frank) I thought I made myself clear.

17:37.431 --> 17:38.807
We are on a clock with this.

17:38.849 --> 17:42.216
I need a bust fast, simple,
tonight if possible.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.812
We're figuring out how it works.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.310
I mean, we know that the bouncer
takes the money——

17:45.356 --> 17:46.311
Good. Bust him.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.847
You know what, Frank?
If it's the bouncers,

17:47.900 --> 17:48.980
then I think Pat Murphy
could help with this.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.641
Patrick Murphy
isn't a cop anymore.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.686
He needs to stay out of this.
So do you.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.648
(lowered voice) Burn.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.064
(Frank) This case is making me sick.
We need a bust tonight, okay?

17:56.158 --> 17:58.570
— So let's go. Let's go!
— Okay.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.868
Hey. You working undercover
again tonight?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.247
That is the plan.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.201
Yeah? Does that mean you're
gonna be wearing that outfit?

18:08.254 --> 18:10.245
lam.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.376
And I'm probably gonna be
very, very tired,

18:13.426 --> 18:16.008
so I'm gonna need you
to help me take it off.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.886
Seriously? Could you please
give it a rest for, like, a day?

18:19.765 --> 18:20.754
Have you seen my sandwich?

18:20.850 --> 18:24.684
No. Hey, it's——it's your, uh...
It's that girl.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.220
Beatrice. Hey——

18:33.070 --> 18:34.571
(Andy) Ohh. Thanks
for helping out with this.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.444
It's actually harder than I thought.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.443
I don't want to say I told you so,
but don't grip it on the sides like that.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.569
— Why?
— 'Cause it's not stable that way.

18:39.619 --> 18:45.034
You wanna take up and under.
Makes it easier.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.621
You better get used to that,

18:49.712 --> 18:52.545
'cause you're gonna be
on your feet again all night.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.376
Oh, thanks, Traci.

18:54.425 --> 18:57.508
Uaughs)

18:57.553 --> 18:58.588
So how was the van?

18:58.638 --> 19:01.050
Hot, stuffy, awkward.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.589
It's not easy being locked up
with your person.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.134
What? What are you talking about,
your "person"?

19:06.228 --> 19:10.062
You know, that person that's wrong
for you or bad for you,

19:10.107 --> 19:11.938
or maybe it's just crappy timing.
I don't know.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.726
It doesn't matter.
You have a history.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.269
They get your jokes.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.278
You can never get them
out of your system.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.484
That person.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.241
Yeah, you really need
to get out of that van.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.901
I don't want to.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.113
Walk. (chuckles)

19:27.166 --> 19:30.124
Well, how was I inappropriate?

19:30.169 --> 19:33.582
I don't know, but she also said
that you made unwanted advances.

19:33.631 --> 19:37.123
— No, sir, I did not.
— Her word against yours,

19:37.176 --> 19:39.007
but I'm still trying to figure out
what the hell you were doing there

19:39.095 --> 19:40.756
in the first place, off—duty.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.170
I had some information
about her boyfriend.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.095
Part of an official investigation?

19:44.141 --> 19:45.130
(sighs) Not exactly.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.175
Not exactly?

19:50.856 --> 19:52.687
So you went to her house,

19:52.775 --> 19:54.640
then inside her house
where these alleged——

19:54.694 --> 19:57.481
No! Not——| did not, okay?
She's lying. Her boyfriend——

19:57.530 --> 19:59.111
Stop talking, Dov!

19:59.865 --> 20:00.854
(sighs)

20:02.159 --> 20:04.115
l have to figure out
how I'm gonna deal with this,

20:05.204 --> 20:06.705
whether or not to send it upstairs.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.996
Any suggestions?

20:12.878 --> 20:14.334
Look, just tell 'em what happened.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.836
(sighs) How? It's like
the whole system's against me.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.133
First Oliver tells me not to do anything,

20:18.175 --> 20:19.381
then I try to do the right thing.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.004
Now Sarge is coming down on me.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.509
| just need to talk to her.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.295
No, you don't.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.054
I know I can't...

20:26.142 --> 20:28.133
(whispers) but maybe you could, right,
woman to woman?

20:29.019 --> 20:32.352
Dov, stick to the facts, okay,
even if it does go upstairs.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.309
I gotta go 'cause the van's
gonna leave without me,

20:34.358 --> 20:37.145
but, Dov, it's gonna be okay.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.686
All right. Let's head out.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.981
(click) Okay?
Take your mind off things.

20:43.033 --> 20:46.196
I can't. Sarge wants me
in booking all night.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.031
All right.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.581
(pats arm)

20:55.588 --> 20:57.374
Cheese,
no pickles, please, Joanna,

20:57.423 --> 21:00.381
and can I get a little, uh,
extra gravy on the side to go?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.166
Thanks.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.255
It's good to see some things
neverchange.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.178
You still eat like a fat guy.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.010
I don't know how you keep
those pounds off, man.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.720
(laughs) Yeah?
Three daughters, that's how.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.759
Ohh.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.060
Lots of energy, big backyard.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.265
How's the beautiful wife?

21:14.356 --> 21:15.937
— Awesome, awesome.
— Good.

21:16.025 --> 21:16.855
You haven't been in here in a while.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.187
Nope, just wanted to know
if you slackasses

21:19.236 --> 21:20.271
have cleaned up my place
yet or not.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.613
I got a business to run, you know?

21:21.697 --> 21:23.562
Yeah, I know. We're on it.
We're on it. We're on it.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.571
— (sighs) Yeah.
— We're on it.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.357
We can't all be supercops
like you used to be.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.071
— Yeah. Look where it got me.
— Hey.

21:28.120 --> 21:28.950
Let me buy you a drink, all right?

21:29.038 --> 21:31.370
I want to see some pictures
of those daughters.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.701
— Soda water for me, buddy.
— Yeah, maybe for you.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.625
These hours are killer.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.078
I haven't seen my boyfriend
in forever.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.712
Plus, he's working with his ex,

21:40.758 --> 21:42.248
which, I'm not worried,

21:42.301 --> 21:44.383
but, you know, they got a history.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.386
The only way to make it work
is with a guy in the industry.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.763
He is. Well, sort of.
Management.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.300
Well, what about you, Tori?

21:52.394 --> 21:53.930
You dating anyone here?

21:53.979 --> 21:56.937
You mean like the owner?
No. I actually earned myjob.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.224
Okay, I'm gonna need that round
for table four, please.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.943
Thank you.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.490
So what does your guy do?

22:05.574 --> 22:06.984
Besides ignore me?

22:07.785 --> 22:09.446
If he wasn't the screen saver
on my phone,

22:09.495 --> 22:11.451
I don't think I'd know
what he looks like.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.572
You want me to watch
the bar for you?

22:16.168 --> 22:17.999
I need a cigarette break.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.664
I'll be in the basement.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.421
(beeps)

22:35.521 --> 22:37.978
— There he is. You know him?
— No.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.604
What? I thought you knew
all the drug guys.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.606
Lot of drug guys, McNally.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.860
But, uh, I'll get this out on the street,
see if I can get an ID, okay?

22:44.947 --> 22:46.483
Okay. I gotta go.
Look, I'm gonna get fired!

22:46.532 --> 22:47.988
(chuckles) You gotta admit,
this is fun, huh?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.649
Way better than papenNork.
We make a good team, you and me.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.193
What are you saying?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.119
Just what I said.
What do you mean?

22:54.164 --> 22:57.201
— Nothing. I gotta go.
— Okay.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.829
Careful.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.369
Don't have too much fun, huh?

23:05.342 --> 23:07.298
(siren wails)

23:07.344 --> 23:09.801
So listen, I was thinking
about this complaint thing.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.304
— Yeah?
— Beatrice says I went inside her house...

23:12.349 --> 23:13.680
(whispers) which I didn't!

23:13.726 --> 23:14.715
Yeah, so it's her word
against yours.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.176
Exactly, but if someone
was waiting in the car,

23:17.229 --> 23:18.685
they would've seen
that I didn't go in.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.472
Yeah, well, it's too bad
you went alone.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.858
Heh. But Sarge doesn't know that...

23:24.904 --> 23:26.895
and neither does Beatrice.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.734
Dov, I'm not gonna lie for you, man.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.986
But she's the one lying about me.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.243
I mean, you believe me, right,
that I didn't do anything to that girl?

23:34.330 --> 23:35.240
Yes, of course I believe you.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.868
Look, I told you not to go in there,
and you did anyway.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.705
l was trying to do my job——
serve and protect, remember?

23:41.754 --> 23:44.587
You sure that's the only reason
you were there?

23:44.673 --> 23:46.504
What are you saying?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.381
Look, I'm sorry, man. I...

23:52.890 --> 23:53.720
(sniffs)

23:53.766 --> 23:55.097
This is the, uh, the lake house.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.765
Just put a new deck on it last year.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.888
Holy——wow.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.428
It all looks like a beer commercial.

24:00.522 --> 24:03.389
(chuckles) Yeah, they, uh,
they shot one up there last summer.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.602
Of course they did.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.935
Yeah. Gotta bring the girls up there
one weekend. You should.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.440
You know...

24:10.783 --> 24:12.774
You really made the most
of taking one in the knee.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.733
Mm. Seriously.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.908
You took the pension, you know,
and you made something happen.

24:19.792 --> 24:20.907
lguess.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.076
Still, some days, I, uh... (sighs)

24:25.089 --> 24:26.420
Well, I miss being out there,

24:26.465 --> 24:29.252
you know, riding around,
king of the city.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.916
Mm.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.926
Drunk guys.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.758
Gettin' peed on.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.593
Yeah. Good times.

24:36.642 --> 24:37.472
— Yeah.
— (chuckles)

24:37.559 --> 24:39.936
Well, it's not much different
than running a nightclub,

24:40.813 --> 24:43.725
except you don't have a bunch of kids
dealing dope behind your back.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.814
Look, Ollie...

24:48.278 --> 24:51.065
(sighs) I can't let these guys
destroy my place. I can't.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.948
I mean, everything I own is——
is tied up in it. Everything.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.326
Just a couple more days.
All right?

24:57.413 --> 24:59.244
Things are just moving a bit slower
than I thought they would.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.621
Why? I thought
this was gonna be simple.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.407
Is it ever?

25:05.170 --> 25:07.832
Look, don't worry, okay?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.247
We're gonna get 'em, okay?

25:10.300 --> 25:11.961
Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
I got it.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.844
You get out there.
Save the world, huh?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.429
All right.

25:17.474 --> 25:18.975
— Thank you for dinner.
— Right.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.471
You owe me.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.689
I know I do.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.309
Cheers.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.647
(Gail, lowered voice)
Little guy at the bar——

25:31.697 --> 25:33.858
he slipped money to big James
when he came in.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.656
I'll follow him. You follow me.
I'll be in the back hallway.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.817
We go on my signal.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.485
(lowered voice) Okay.
Who's gonna cover our tables?

25:40.873 --> 25:44.036
It doesn't really matter
if we make the bust, Andy.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.552
(beeps)

26:01.643 --> 26:03.895
What are you, a teenager?

26:03.979 --> 26:05.139
You can text on your own time.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.145
Right now you work for me.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.861
(Traci) So what's it take
to be detective?

26:15.699 --> 26:18.532
You making conversation,
or you actually want this job?

26:21.163 --> 26:23.529
Oh, I don't know.
I thought it would be fun.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.077
I'd get to order ethnic food and burp

26:26.168 --> 26:29.706
while doing surveillance
with an irresistibly hot rookie.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.212
lrresistibly hot?
Is that what you are?

26:34.384 --> 26:35.669
Yeah, I guess you're right.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.260
Okay, don't look at me like that.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.929
— Ohh.
— Mm—hmm.

26:45.020 --> 26:49.730
Ohh. See, it's important to me
that we're able to work together,

26:49.775 --> 26:51.561
and you know I made a decision...

26:52.569 --> 26:56.061
to be with Leo's dad,
because he's Leo's dad.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.528
Yeah, which makes him
a good babysitter.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.532
Doesn't make him good for you.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.034
(door opens)

27:06.083 --> 27:07.118
(Sam clearing throat)

27:09.962 --> 27:11.042
We gotta hit the brakes.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.579
My C.|. says there's a good chance
this guy is Russell Mackie.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.872
— Russell Mackie?
—Yeah. (chuckles)

27:14.925 --> 27:17.257
— Who's Russell Mackie?
— Oh, he's a dealer from Montreal.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.760
Got outstanding warrants for trafficking,
conspiracy to traffic.

27:20.806 --> 27:21.761
Yeah, and we're never gonna get him

27:21.807 --> 27:24.093
if we bust some meathead doorman
named James.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.974
Text Andy. Tell her it's off.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.972
Whatever they do,
do not bust anyone tonight.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.303
Yeah, I'm doing it,
but she might not hear it.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.308
It's pretty loud in there.

27:32.401 --> 27:33.436
All right. I'm going in.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.101
Okay, wait. Hold on.
You're gonna blow the whole thing.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.146
No,no,no.
I'm a cop answering a call.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.731
All right. Keep this on.

27:40.784 --> 27:41.648
Okay, Dad.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.155
Russell Mackie.

27:48.959 --> 27:52.622
We got a call for a disturbance.
Anybody here call the police?

27:52.671 --> 27:54.957
Folks? Hello?

27:55.007 --> 27:56.998
All right, I don't know
what's going on here,

27:57.092 --> 27:59.003
but whatever it is,
it stops right now.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.630
You got it?
This stops now.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.796
— What the hell?!
— Look, I got him!

28:03.849 --> 28:06.181
— What is going on?
— What is this?

28:06.268 --> 28:07.599
(Tori) What the hell
are you doing?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.803
l th——l thought he was
running out on the bill.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.096
(man) I could sue you, you know?

28:12.149 --> 28:14.356
— Don't worry. She's fired!
— What?!

28:15.110 --> 28:17.852
I don't care who you're sleeping with.
You're done. Now.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.276
(sighs)
Is there a problem, officer?

28:21.325 --> 28:23.316
Because, uh, I think
we've got this under control.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.154
— You got it under control? Yeah?
— Uh—huh.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.320
You sure about that?
Okay.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.114
'Cause we don't need any more drama
in here tonight, right?

28:32.002 --> 28:33.367
Good. Thanks.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.133
So you're sure the guy is Russell Mackie?

28:45.182 --> 28:46.217
Yeah. lD's confirmed. lt's him.

28:46.308 --> 28:49.345
Mm. He's been off the radar
for over a year. That's a big fish.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.680
— All in a day's work.
— (chuckles)

28:51.730 --> 28:54.187
You know, Jerry's working on warrants
to get a wire set up in the club.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.224
What, so you and Peck are just
supposed to play it cool?

28:56.318 --> 28:57.683
Oh, my God. That's the best part.

28:57.736 --> 29:01.320
Gail got fired.
(laughs) It was great.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.230
So you'll be in there without backup?

29:03.325 --> 29:05.486
— Mm. I'll be fine.
— Yeah, I know you'll be fine,

29:05.535 --> 29:08.072
but, uh, Mackie's not some punk dealer.
He's violent.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.654
Jo and I looked into him a couple years ago
on the Kovac murder.

29:10.707 --> 29:14.541
Hmm. You and Jo worked
a lot of big cases together, huh?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.998
Yeah. We're partners.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.537
I know.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.920
All right. Well, I should
probably get going.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.672
(sandwich paper rustles)

29:26.223 --> 29:27.258
Hey, Andy.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.220
I love you, you know?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.681
Yeah, I know.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.769
— So I'm on probation?
— That's right.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.726
There'll be an investigation.
A union rep will be in touch.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.395
Epstein, every cop gets a complaint.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.063
Well, what exactly
does probation mean?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.950
It means you'll ride with
a supervising officer. Always.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.197
— Like a rookie?
— You are a rookie.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.366
Don't forget it.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.747
Yes, sir.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.714
Poor kid.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.586
I heard you and Murphy tilted a few
at the Penny last night.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.126
Yeah. (chuckles)
Yeah, we bumped into each other.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.134
I'd be a little more careful
who we bump into.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.563
You know what?
That's how it goes.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.443
You got your knuckles rapped.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.158
You know,
it happens to the best of us.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.744
(Dov) You ever think about
not being a cop?

30:30.746 --> 30:31.735
Shut up already.

30:32.331 --> 30:33.616
You know what?

30:33.665 --> 30:36.953
Next time...
just do better, you know?

30:37.002 --> 30:38.458
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta get a haircut.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.664
(dispatcher on radio)
1540, available units,

30:40.756 --> 30:43.668
we've got a domestic assault
at 2675 Carlaw.

30:44.426 --> 30:45.791
That's Beatrice's house.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.466
Mark 1505.
We're on our way.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.848
(siren wails)

31:00.859 --> 31:02.850
(voice breaks) You're off the clock.
You can go home now.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.026
Okay, yeah, I was just setting up
for tomorrow.

31:09.368 --> 31:10.323
Are you okay?

31:14.706 --> 31:16.207
You want a drink?

31:18.043 --> 31:19.032
Sure.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.710
(chuckles, sniffles)

31:21.797 --> 31:24.504
(Noelle) Stop struggling, kid,
or I promise, it's gonna get ugly!

31:24.549 --> 31:26.540
— I didn't do anything.
— (Chris) Yeah, except knock on your girlfriend!

31:26.635 --> 31:28.000
— Ohh! Please. (grunts)
— You should, uh...

31:28.053 --> 31:29.293
— Wait in the car?
— Yeah.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.382
— (Noelle) l'm warning you!
— Aah!

31:32.057 --> 31:33.513
Don't test me!

31:33.558 --> 31:36.971
— (grunts) Get off!
— Get in the car!

31:37.687 --> 31:40.349
(Oliver) Ma'am, is there
anyone else in the house?

31:40.399 --> 31:42.685
Are you——
Can you turn for me?

31:42.734 --> 31:44.520
Are you all right?
Do you need an ambulance?

31:44.569 --> 31:45.820
— No. No, I'm fine. (sniffles)
— Are you hurt?

31:45.862 --> 31:46.897
I'm fine.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.734
— Did he do that to you?
— (crying)

31:49.825 --> 31:50.905
Does he live here?

31:51.493 --> 31:53.358
Are you sure you don't want
an ambulance?

31:53.412 --> 31:55.027
l have a first—aid kit in the car.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.661
I'm gonna go get it, okay?
I'll be right back.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.577
(Tori) There's nothing I can do.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.205
Russell's a classic Scorpio——

32:06.258 --> 32:08.340
extreme, intense,

32:08.385 --> 32:09.750
totally frustrating.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.756
Yeah, and he's probably
really sexy, right?

32:11.847 --> 32:13.587
And smart and funny,

32:13.682 --> 32:15.422
and you can't keep your hands
off of him.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.007
Sounds like you know him.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.221
Mm—hmm. I know the type.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.260
(cell phone alert chimes)

32:21.940 --> 32:23.225
He's texting me.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.607
(Andy) So, um, what does
your guy do for a living?

32:35.078 --> 32:38.741
(Tori) Oh, he does all kinds of things,
most of them illegal.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.451
(Andy) That must be hard.

32:40.542 --> 32:41.907
Go, Andy.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.123
(Tori) lt's hopeless.
I keep trying to end it, and...

32:45.213 --> 32:47.750
he just ignores me for weeks.
I don't hear from him.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.414
(clink, pouring liquid)
He doesn't call,

32:49.468 --> 32:51.254
— and then he just shows up, and——
— You can't say no.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.297
— (sighs)
— | get it.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.721
| get it. It's kind of exciting
and gets your heart going.

32:57.309 --> 33:01.222
— So you dated a guy like that?
— Uh...

33:01.271 --> 33:03.307
Yeah. I think we all have.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.225
You know...

33:05.275 --> 33:07.891
Russell's never even said
he loves me.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.480
I'm sure he does.

33:10.906 --> 33:13.773
Why can't guys like that just come out
and say the way they feel?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.658
(chuckles) I wish I knew.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.455
So your guy's like that?

33:19.498 --> 33:20.908
Uh,Luke?

33:22.334 --> 33:23.323
No.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.492
No, he's great.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.287
He tells you he loves you?

33:32.177 --> 33:35.590
Yeah. Actually he does.
(chuckles)

33:36.598 --> 33:37.462
To Luke.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.472
(both laugh)
(clink)

33:39.976 --> 33:42.433
— Whew!
— Oh, boy.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.310
That was great work today,
detective.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.689
(chuckles) Yeah, there's no way
Musconi walks this time.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.813
It was definitely easier than I thought,
going back in time like that.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.022
Yeah.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.323
(sighs)

33:58.620 --> 34:01.612
(laughs) All right.
Come on, scum bucket. One drink.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.285
Okay. (laughs nervously)

34:05.335 --> 34:06.541
— Night then.
— Hey, hey. Come on.

34:06.628 --> 34:07.959
Don't be like that, all right?

34:08.004 --> 34:09.335
Why?

34:09.381 --> 34:11.212
What else do you want to do?

34:14.844 --> 34:15.970
Night, Luke.

34:16.012 --> 34:19.379
(keys jangle, car door opens)

34:21.685 --> 34:23.721
(starts engine)

34:27.691 --> 34:31.730
(Tori laughs) Whoa!
Your ears must be burning.

34:32.988 --> 34:34.194
Who's she?

34:34.239 --> 34:35.695
Uh, my friend.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.196
That's Mackie. He's here.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.984
Andy. You're Russell, right?

34:40.036 --> 34:41.151
How do you know my name?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.865
(Tori) 'Cause you're famous.
Why do you think?

34:42.914 --> 34:44.575
This is Echo 1.
We need backup.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.078
See, | make one friend,
and this is what happens.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.910
— I need to talk to you. Now.
— You're high.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.370
— Let's go.
— No. I already told you,

34:51.423 --> 34:53.004
I'm not dealing with you
when you're like this.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.914
Ow!

34:56.845 --> 34:57.925
(lowered voice)
You been talking to the cops?

34:58.013 --> 34:59.594
What?!
(sarcastic) Yeah. Okay. Right.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.046
I've been talking to the cops.
Ow!

35:01.099 --> 35:02.680
— You are getting paranoid.
— Let's go.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.512
Okay. Okay, wait!
Leave her alone. Let her go.

35:04.561 --> 35:05.892
OthenNise I will call the cops.

35:05.937 --> 35:06.847
Oh, that's what you're gonna do?

35:06.896 --> 35:08.557
— Yeah.
— Huh? You're gonna call the cops?

35:08.607 --> 35:09.767
All right.
You know what? Relax.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.268
Stop waving the gun around.

35:11.860 --> 35:12.724
(Russell) Your friend here——

35:12.777 --> 35:14.392
— how long have you known her?
— Gun! Go, go, go, go, go!

35:14.446 --> 35:15.401
(Tori) Couple of days.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.063
A couple of days, and you're shooting
your mouth off. You stupid bitch.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.949
Okay, you know, we were just sitting around
having a couple drinks, okay?

35:21.036 --> 35:21.900
She didn't even tell me anything.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.693
I don't even know what you're talking about,
so just calm down.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.612
— Don't. Do not tell me what to do!
— Russell, you don't know what you're doing!

35:25.707 --> 35:26.696
— I will go with you!
— Do not tell me what to do!

35:26.750 --> 35:28.706
Get the gun out of my face,
all right?! |——

35:28.752 --> 35:30.288
— (gunshots)
— (Andy and Tori scream)

35:31.087 --> 35:32.952
Oh! Ohh! (gasping)

35:33.048 --> 35:34.709
Police! Don't move!

35:36.301 --> 35:38.257
— McNally?
— I'm okay. I don't know what happened.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.543
I don't know where it came from.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.712
Shots fired. Vestibule nightclub.
We need an ambulance.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.881
Police!

35:44.934 --> 35:46.094
— Put the gun down.
— Whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:46.144 --> 35:48.476
Whoa! It's me, it's me.
Okay?

35:48.563 --> 35:50.599
— Put it down!
— I'm putting it down.

35:50.649 --> 35:51.809
Take it easy.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.436
— Slowly.
— Okay.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.479
l was in the back office.
I heard yelling.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.610
Look, the guy was gonna kill her.
She didn't have any backup.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.946
(Tori crying)

36:15.090 --> 36:19.083
(Tori sobbing)

36:26.643 --> 36:27.473
How's the nose?

36:27.519 --> 36:29.180
(locker rattles)

36:29.521 --> 36:32.137
— Oh, it's——it's better. Thanks.
— Good.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.602
(Velcro rips)

36:34.651 --> 36:37.768
(sighs) So you were right, you know,

36:37.821 --> 36:39.436
about that girl's boyfriend.

36:39.489 --> 36:41.605
Yeah. Didn't really want to be right
about that one.

36:41.658 --> 36:44.445
Yeah, well, she's pressing charges,

36:44.494 --> 36:46.985
so that'll probably help with everything.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.871
I mean, you know, you were just
trying to do the right thing.

36:49.958 --> 36:50.822
Oh, it doesn't matter.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.831
You were right.
I shouldn't have gone over there,

36:52.877 --> 36:55.994
and I never should've asked you to lie.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.793
(locker door clanks closed)

37:04.055 --> 37:05.215
(door release buzzer, beep)

37:06.015 --> 37:07.846
— Here you go, pal.
— Thanks.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.302
(Oliver coughs)

37:10.895 --> 37:14.387
(exhales deeply)
God, I can't stop shaking. This is crazy.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.689
Hey, been a while
since you fired a gun.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.356
Ah.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.896
Just tell me, all right?
Who was he?

37:22.991 --> 37:24.652
I'm sure you guys
have lD'd him by now.

37:24.701 --> 37:28.660
Name's Russell Mackie.
Does that name ring a bell?

37:28.705 --> 37:33.039
No? He was a coke dealer,
you know, back in the day.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.042
I'm surprised you don't,
uh... whatever.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.702
What we're really trying
to figure out is

37:37.756 --> 37:39.747
why he thought his girlfriend
was talking to cops.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.842
Yeah, well... heh.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.502
Come on.

37:45.555 --> 37:48.718
You put two rookies in there.
I'm sure they let it slip.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.382
I wouldn't want
to be held accountable

37:50.435 --> 37:53.017
for our first few times
undercover, right?

37:53.062 --> 37:54.393
You know, it's a hard job.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.225
Ain't that the truth.

37:59.694 --> 38:00.604
So what's next?

38:07.452 --> 38:08.783
You.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.735
When did you start working
with Mackie?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.199
What?

38:13.249 --> 38:15.956
Ex—cop. That——
That has gotta be convenient.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.912
Lots of drug connections,
lots of potential business partners.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.249
Are you serious?

38:22.717 --> 38:24.799
I saved that rookie's life.

38:24.886 --> 38:28.128
And killed the only person
who could connect you to this.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.223
You had to protect your business, right?

38:32.268 --> 38:33.974
Everything you got's tied up in it.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.230
I took a bullet...

38:39.275 --> 38:40.560
on duty...

38:40.610 --> 38:42.146
protecting you.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.647
Yeah, you did. Yeah.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.150
They're executing a search warrant
on the club,

38:51.412 --> 38:52.492
yourcondo.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.122
And I told them to check the lake house.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.328
Go for it.
Check phone records, too.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.415
I know what you're doing.
I know how this works.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.420
Yeah, I know you do, and that's why
we're not gonna find anything.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.513
(sighs)

39:10.515 --> 39:13.928
Brother, you got an enviable life...

39:13.977 --> 39:15.342
(Murphy chuckles)

39:15.436 --> 39:18.849
but I wouldn't want to be you,

39:18.940 --> 39:21.306
not when Mackie's crew
finds out what you did.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.314
Even if they don't.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.647
(chair scrapes)
Ollie.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.941
— Ollie.
— I'm done.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.860
I'm done here.
(door release buzzer, beep)

39:42.839 --> 39:44.045
(horn honks)

39:50.722 --> 39:51.882
(keys jangle)

39:53.141 --> 39:55.132
I miss you.

39:55.184 --> 39:58.312
| just wanted to get that out in the open.
I wanted to say it.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.310
(Marc Robillard's "Unfold" playing)

40:00.356 --> 40:02.017
Now we can forget it.
(chuckles)

40:02.734 --> 40:03.723
Forget it?

40:03.818 --> 40:05.979
J‘ Can I open up those eyes? J‘

40:06.029 --> 40:08.520
— Trace.
— lt's... (sighs)

40:08.573 --> 40:11.406
— J‘ See what lies behind J‘
— Come here.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.911
(Jerry) Ohh.

40:13.995 --> 40:17.533
J‘ I'll put my hands in yours
and hold on tight J‘

40:17.582 --> 40:18.537
It's all right.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.825
J‘ Let's see what we can find J‘

40:23.880 --> 40:26.838
J‘ If I could show J‘

40:29.010 --> 40:31.843
J‘ You are the gold J‘

40:33.932 --> 40:36.014
— J‘ Then you would know J‘
— Hey.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.344
Hey.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.429
Good work tonight.
You were smart.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.390
Kept it real.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.056
| just stuck with it,

40:46.069 --> 40:47.684
the way I was taught.

40:50.907 --> 40:55.571
J‘ But let me open up those pretty eyes J‘

40:55.620 --> 40:58.111
Wow. New look.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.414
Yeah. It's my showered and shaved,
picking up my girlfriend look.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.245
— Oh.
— Even had a nap.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.245
I love you, you know?

41:07.298 --> 41:08.208
I know.

41:08.257 --> 41:11.920
J‘ How it all,
it could unfold J‘
