WEBVTT

00:03.584 --> 00:05.316
So, Mike and Martina,

00:05.351 --> 00:07.686
let's talk about why you're
seeking therapy today.

00:07.721 --> 00:09.387
She made me.

00:11.592 --> 00:13.323
- What are you writing?
- Mike.

00:13.358 --> 00:14.625
He's just taking notes.

00:16.027 --> 00:18.963
He's writing about you now.

00:18.998 --> 00:20.731
You don't know that.

00:20.766 --> 00:22.265
Are you?

00:22.301 --> 00:23.801
Let's get back to why you're here.

00:23.836 --> 00:25.002
Yes.

00:25.037 --> 00:27.437
We're here about a
dilemma Mike's facing.

00:27.473 --> 00:30.473
It all began when I was
counseling a mother and daughter

00:30.508 --> 00:34.110
who were having some problems
since they moved in together.

00:34.145 --> 00:35.511
I just
can't control her.

00:35.546 --> 00:37.346
Coming in at all hours,

00:37.381 --> 00:39.582
drinking, loud music,

00:39.618 --> 00:41.618
an endless parade of men.

00:44.455 --> 00:47.889
I'm just having a little fun.

00:47.925 --> 00:50.826
Well, adult parents and
children living together again

00:50.861 --> 00:52.794
does present a lot of challenges.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.596
It certainly does.

00:54.632 --> 00:56.898
That stupid accent!

00:58.435 --> 00:59.534
It's not a choice.

00:59.569 --> 01:01.837
You married a British man
and raised me in London.

01:01.872 --> 01:05.105
Raised me in London.

01:05.141 --> 01:07.341
Who talks like that?

01:07.376 --> 01:09.977
Everyone in London!

01:10.013 --> 01:12.312
Can you even understand her?

01:14.117 --> 01:15.482
Mom, major emergency.

01:15.518 --> 01:16.450
Stella!

01:16.485 --> 01:17.818
I'm in session.

01:17.854 --> 01:20.354
You know I've said not to come
in when the door is closed.

01:20.389 --> 01:21.621
Yeah, but you also said

01:21.657 --> 01:23.289
you're sad you don't
have enough patients,

01:23.324 --> 01:27.160
so sometimes you just come
in here to cry, so...

01:27.195 --> 01:29.896
Stella, whatever it is,
we'll deal with it later.

01:29.931 --> 01:32.132
Oh, sorry about that.

01:32.167 --> 01:33.900
Now, let's get back...

01:33.935 --> 01:35.401
<i>Martina!</i>

01:35.436 --> 01:38.637
<i>I don't feel so good.</i>

01:38.673 --> 01:40.172
Whoa, whoa.

01:40.207 --> 01:42.607
Yes, I was a little under the weather,

01:42.643 --> 01:44.877
but that is not how it happened.

01:47.447 --> 01:49.281
Mike, what are you doing out of bed?

01:49.316 --> 01:51.349
You're deathly ill.

01:51.385 --> 01:52.751
Yes, I am,

01:52.787 --> 01:55.820
but that wood isn't gonna chop itself.

01:55.855 --> 01:57.989
That is not how it went.

01:58.024 --> 02:00.892
Although I would like
you to chop that wood.

02:00.927 --> 02:03.594
It's a lot of work.

02:03.629 --> 02:05.763
<i>Martina!</i>

02:05.799 --> 02:07.031
That's my husband.

02:07.067 --> 02:08.532
He's not feeling well,

02:08.568 --> 02:10.133
and you know how men get.

02:10.169 --> 02:11.502
She doesn't.

02:11.537 --> 02:12.936
Ugh.

02:12.971 --> 02:14.037
This again.

02:14.073 --> 02:15.806
She's a virgin.

02:17.076 --> 02:19.076
I am not a virgin.

02:19.111 --> 02:20.610
It can lapse!

02:20.645 --> 02:23.513
Like a driver's license.

02:23.548 --> 02:25.381
That's ridiculous.

02:25.417 --> 02:28.018
I was married up until ten years ago.

02:28.053 --> 02:30.786
I will admit it has been a while.

02:30.822 --> 02:34.190
There are cobwebs down there.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.728
Stop pushing me, Mother.

02:38.763 --> 02:40.730
I'll go out again when I'm ready.

02:40.765 --> 02:42.331
Look, we really don't mind

02:42.366 --> 02:43.899
if you need to tend to your family.

02:43.935 --> 02:45.967
Your daughter did say
it was an emergency.

02:46.002 --> 02:49.270
Well, thank you.

02:49.305 --> 02:52.140
I'm sure it's nothing, but
I will be right back.

02:54.677 --> 02:56.945
It must be nice to have a
daughter who needs you

02:56.980 --> 02:58.880
and wants your advice.

02:58.915 --> 03:01.482
You don't give me advice, just insults.

03:01.517 --> 03:03.183
I don't insult you.

03:03.219 --> 03:04.551
Just this morning you asked me

03:04.586 --> 03:08.355
which mortician died and
left me his clothes.

03:08.390 --> 03:12.092
A genuine question.

03:12.128 --> 03:15.028
All right, what's the big emergency?

03:15.064 --> 03:16.696
This is tough, Mom.

03:16.732 --> 03:18.565
Have you ever heard of
Lou Gehrig's disease?

03:18.600 --> 03:20.967
Yes. Oh, my God, Stella.

03:21.002 --> 03:24.771
Well, there's a play about
it, and I have an audition.

03:24.806 --> 03:26.906
But I told them I could
do accents, and I can't.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.440
Mom, help.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.842
It's the first day of my internship,

03:29.878 --> 03:30.943
and I'm freaking out.

03:30.979 --> 03:32.044
Which outfit says,

03:32.080 --> 03:33.146
"Take my seriously, damn it,

03:33.181 --> 03:35.214
but I'm a little fun."

03:35.250 --> 03:37.249
The left one.

03:37.284 --> 03:40.218
Oh, and you, Google "accents"
and do what they say,

03:40.254 --> 03:42.988
then Google "real problems"
and pay attention.

03:45.458 --> 03:50.195
Oh, I am so sorry for that interruption.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.496
Where's your mother?

03:51.531 --> 03:53.498
She went to help your husband.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.999
What?

03:59.172 --> 04:01.305
Is this helping you?

04:01.340 --> 04:02.940
I'm not sure.

04:02.975 --> 04:06.576
It's sure helping me.

04:06.612 --> 04:09.280
Sandy, what are you doing in here?

04:09.315 --> 04:13.316
She showed up and started
rubbing VapoRub on my chest.

04:13.351 --> 04:15.451
And...

04:15.486 --> 04:18.553
I just went with it.

04:18.589 --> 04:20.690
This is wrong. You can't be here.

04:20.725 --> 04:22.458
I'm your therapist.

04:22.493 --> 04:23.960
Oh, not anymore.

04:23.995 --> 04:26.662
This poor man needs me.

04:26.698 --> 04:28.297
That's my job.

04:28.332 --> 04:30.665
I think I can take care of my husband.

04:30.701 --> 04:32.801
So why aren't you feeding him?

04:32.837 --> 04:34.269
Feed a cold;

04:34.305 --> 04:35.670
starve a fever.

04:35.706 --> 04:37.372
I could eat.

04:38.608 --> 04:40.843
How do chocolate chip pancakes sound?

04:40.878 --> 04:43.912
Could you make the chocolate
chips into a smiley face?

04:43.948 --> 04:46.413
With a whipped cream beard.

04:46.449 --> 04:47.748
That sounds good.

04:47.783 --> 04:50.184
Can we keep her?

04:52.000 --> 04:58.074

05:03.631 --> 05:06.299
Excuse me.

05:06.335 --> 05:07.400
When I was in here before,

05:07.435 --> 05:09.970
I noticed you do a great British accent.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.171
It's just how I talk.

05:11.206 --> 05:12.505
Okay, you don't have

05:12.540 --> 05:15.475
to brag about how easy it is for you.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.543
Anyway, I have a play audition tomorrow,

05:17.579 --> 05:19.211
so I could I follow you around tonight

05:19.247 --> 05:20.612
and learn how to talk like you?

05:20.647 --> 05:23.015
I mean, you don't have, like,
a date or anything, do you?

05:23.050 --> 05:23.983
No.

05:25.019 --> 05:25.951
No dates for me.

05:27.121 --> 05:30.122
It's kind of your own fault.

05:30.157 --> 05:32.424
You're like the girl in
a teen move who's ugly

05:32.459 --> 05:35.261
until she takes her glasses
off, and then she's hot.

05:37.830 --> 05:39.264
Huh...

05:39.299 --> 05:42.267
That must just be in the movies.

05:42.302 --> 05:44.135
Anyway, I can help, okay?

05:44.170 --> 05:45.569
You teach me to talk like a Brit,

05:45.605 --> 05:47.438
and I will make you over.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.974
I must say I'm intrigued.

05:50.010 --> 05:54.344
I
must say I'm intrigued!

05:54.380 --> 05:56.579
We've got a lot of work to do.

05:56.615 --> 05:57.948
Oh, don't put yourself down.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.417
You're not that unattractive.

06:04.423 --> 06:07.190
Oh, these pancakes are so good.

06:08.427 --> 06:11.760
Even sick, you're an attractive man.

06:13.697 --> 06:15.298
What the hell's going on, son?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.265
Son?

06:16.301 --> 06:18.567
So that's where you get it.

06:18.602 --> 06:21.971
You need to get out of bed
so we can go watch the game.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.206
- I got a cold.
- Typical.

06:24.242 --> 06:25.541
I don't get colds.

06:25.576 --> 06:27.575
I felt one coming on once,
but I told it to screw,

06:27.610 --> 06:28.876
and that was the end of it.

06:28.912 --> 06:30.445
I could listen to you

06:30.480 --> 06:34.416
telling things to screw all night.

06:34.451 --> 06:36.351
Who is this?

06:36.386 --> 06:37.718
Dad, this is Sandy.

06:37.754 --> 06:40.855
She's a little tiny angel,
and I'm keeping her.

06:40.890 --> 06:42.657
Go watch the game with Alice.

06:42.692 --> 06:45.092
Alice is at Bible study again,

06:45.127 --> 06:47.494
and apparently I'm not allowed to join.

06:47.529 --> 06:50.831
I didn't want my husband to
go to my Bible study either.

06:50.866 --> 06:51.865
Why not?

06:51.900 --> 06:53.767
Because I wasn't there.

06:53.802 --> 06:56.837
I was having an affair.

06:56.872 --> 06:59.306
Well, Alice is not having an affair.

06:59.342 --> 07:00.907
She's studying the good book.

07:00.943 --> 07:02.708
When she comes home from Bible study,

07:02.743 --> 07:04.577
she's full of the Spirit.

07:04.612 --> 07:07.347
Flushed and satisfied.

07:07.382 --> 07:08.747
Happy...

07:08.783 --> 07:10.683
tired...

07:10.718 --> 07:13.419
Good God, I have to investigate.

07:13.455 --> 07:16.755
I have an idea how you
can get back at her!

07:18.993 --> 07:21.126
He'll be back.

07:28.124 --> 07:30.959
Hi, I'm Shea Moore, the new intern.

07:30.994 --> 07:33.661
I'm Nate Johnson, the other new intern.

07:33.696 --> 07:35.463
Nice to meet you.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.431
Whoa...

07:37.467 --> 07:39.767
what are we gonna do about this?

07:39.802 --> 07:41.202
What "this"?

07:41.237 --> 07:43.804
The obvious sexual tension between us.

07:43.839 --> 07:48.809
Well, I don't see
how it could be obvious.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.544
Nice try. Your breath is shallow.

07:50.579 --> 07:52.179
The capillaries in your
cheeks are reddening,

07:52.214 --> 07:54.247
and your pupils are dilating.

07:54.283 --> 07:56.082
Yeah, I'm also an MD.
I was a triple major.

07:56.117 --> 07:57.484
They told me I couldn't do that!

07:57.519 --> 07:58.785
Yeah.

07:58.820 --> 08:00.687
They told me I couldn't park
my motorcycle in my room.

08:00.722 --> 08:02.789
Did I listen to them? I don't know.

08:02.824 --> 08:04.357
Ask the grease stains on my carpet.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.194
A bad boy.

08:08.229 --> 08:10.028
Look, let's just reduce this equation

08:10.064 --> 08:12.331
down to the lowest terms.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.899
Honestly, every cell in my being

08:13.934 --> 08:15.568
is just screaming to make love to you.

08:15.603 --> 08:16.835
They are?

08:16.870 --> 08:18.136
I'm not gonna let that happen.

08:18.172 --> 08:19.605
What?

08:19.640 --> 08:22.107
No, this internship's too
important to the both of us.

08:22.142 --> 08:23.309
We're astrophysicists.

08:23.344 --> 08:26.578
We're not gonna let our
biology screw this up.

08:26.613 --> 08:29.046
Yeah, I'm funny too. You're doomed.

08:33.453 --> 08:36.554
Oh, my God! You're still here.

08:36.590 --> 08:38.690
Why are you still here?

08:38.725 --> 08:41.125
Good genes, I guess.

08:43.462 --> 08:45.362
She's making me pie.
Don't be mad, Martina.

08:45.397 --> 08:46.996
She's just taking care of me.

08:47.032 --> 08:48.632
I take care of you.

08:48.667 --> 08:52.168
Yeah, but then I have to
take care of you back.

08:52.204 --> 08:53.470
Hello, all.

08:53.505 --> 08:56.340
Sweetheart, how was your
first day at the new job?

08:56.375 --> 08:57.374
It was great,

08:57.409 --> 09:00.075
except there's a fellow intern who is...

09:00.111 --> 09:02.845
well, I don't know how to put this.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.813
You want to have sex with him.

09:06.718 --> 09:07.550
Sandy!

09:07.585 --> 09:08.584
No, she's right.

09:10.288 --> 09:13.289
Honey, workplace romances
can be really risky.

09:13.324 --> 09:15.490
What if he's the love of her life?

09:15.525 --> 09:16.658
She's 23.

09:16.693 --> 09:18.993
How can this guy possibly
be the love of her life?

09:19.028 --> 09:20.828
We got married at 23.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.330
We had to.

09:22.366 --> 09:26.167
I met the love of my life at 23...

09:26.202 --> 09:29.937
and 47...

09:29.973 --> 09:33.540
and 65...

09:33.576 --> 09:36.610
I'm just saying be smart.

09:36.646 --> 09:39.413
And I'm just saying there
are other variables.

09:39.448 --> 09:43.049
Mom, as always, your advice is spot-on,

09:43.085 --> 09:45.051
but this lady's advice
is a little bit better

09:45.087 --> 09:46.887
and seems like it might get me laid.

09:49.057 --> 09:50.856
And I am, sadly, only human.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.293
Oh, who wants pie?

09:53.328 --> 09:55.828
- I do.
- Pie? There's pie?

09:55.863 --> 09:57.764
Okay, Sandy,

09:57.799 --> 09:58.864
time to go home.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.367
Do you need a lift?
Should I call an Uber?

10:01.403 --> 10:03.035
A horse-and-buggy?

10:04.673 --> 10:07.005
I'm not going anywhere.

10:07.040 --> 10:07.972
What?

10:08.008 --> 10:10.442
Your family needs me.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.177
I'm filling a vacuum.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.212
By the way, I vacuumed.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.850
I mean, obviously, as a therapist,

10:18.885 --> 10:19.984
I could see that she was

10:20.020 --> 10:21.753
projecting her relationship issues

10:21.789 --> 10:23.321
with her daughter onto us.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.022
Oh, stop showing off.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.159
And since I couldn't reason with Sandy,

10:29.195 --> 10:31.562
I decided to talk to her daughter Gwen

10:31.597 --> 10:33.931
who had spent the day with Stella.

10:33.966 --> 10:37.835
'Ello, Mum, fancy a pint?

10:37.870 --> 10:40.937
It's me, Stella.

10:40.972 --> 10:44.541
Do I make you 'orny?

10:44.576 --> 10:45.675
I'm your mother.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.577
I'm practicing my new accent.

10:47.612 --> 10:49.145
Gwen and I watched some British films

10:49.180 --> 10:50.313
about that Austin Powers guy.

10:50.349 --> 10:52.248
Well, where is Gwen? I
need to talk to her.

10:52.283 --> 10:53.516
She's in the loo.

10:53.552 --> 10:55.385
That's British for toilet!

10:55.420 --> 10:59.020
They have a word for
everything over there.

10:59.056 --> 11:00.989
Hello, Martina.

11:01.024 --> 11:03.992
Wow, you look amazing!

11:04.027 --> 11:05.427
I feel like a whole new woman!

11:05.463 --> 11:07.763
Between Stella's makeover and
not having my mum around,

11:07.798 --> 11:09.498
I've never been happier.

11:09.533 --> 11:10.599
That being said,

11:10.634 --> 11:12.735
wouldn't you like to
have your mom around?

11:12.770 --> 11:13.836
God, no.

11:13.871 --> 11:16.771
But she's driving me crazy.

11:16.806 --> 11:20.875
What I'm hearing sounds
like a you problem.

11:20.910 --> 11:23.310
You know, it's amazing
what not being insulted

11:23.346 --> 11:25.680
24 hours a day does to your self-esteem.

11:25.715 --> 11:28.048
Gwen, as a professional therapist,

11:28.084 --> 11:30.551
let me just say this is no fair!

11:31.820 --> 11:33.687
Whoa, warehouse party.

11:33.722 --> 11:36.890
It's starting right now, and
the Snapchats are dope.

11:36.925 --> 11:38.057
Whatever that is,

11:38.093 --> 11:40.794
it sounds like exactly what I need.

11:40.829 --> 11:42.929
Oh, behave!

11:42.964 --> 11:45.131
That means we're not gonna behave.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.333
Well, after the party,
how about you come by

11:47.369 --> 11:48.734
and pick up your mother?

11:48.770 --> 11:50.636
If you agree, walk out the door

11:50.671 --> 11:53.672
without saying anything!

11:53.708 --> 11:56.442
Oh, looks like it's time for
me to go to Bible study.

11:56.477 --> 11:58.010
Again?

11:58.045 --> 11:59.545
You just went last night.

11:59.580 --> 12:02.014
Oh, it's a long book, Bob.

12:04.585 --> 12:07.485
So what have you been studying?

12:07.521 --> 12:09.120
Obadiah 1:9.

12:09.155 --> 12:10.555
Oh, come on. You made that up.

12:10.590 --> 12:13.024
There's no such thing as Obadiah 1:9.

12:13.059 --> 12:14.125
Yes, there is.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.960
We read that passage at our wedding.

12:15.995 --> 12:19.063
Oh, yeah.

12:19.098 --> 12:20.998
Greatest day of my life.

12:21.034 --> 12:22.800
Alice. Hmm?

12:22.835 --> 12:26.036
Whatever you do, never
forget I'm an ex-cop.

12:26.071 --> 12:28.505
I'm trained to see things
other men don't see.

12:28.541 --> 12:30.707
I notice things other men don't notice.

12:30.743 --> 12:33.510
I hear things other men don't hear.

12:33.546 --> 12:35.946
Nothing gets by me, my love.

12:35.981 --> 12:38.615
Nothing.

12:38.651 --> 12:41.884
Oh... your wedding vow!

12:44.021 --> 12:46.556
But really, I got to go!

12:49.794 --> 12:52.695
So I say we evaluate our
potential relationship

12:52.730 --> 12:55.097
as if it were any other
scientific dilemma.

12:55.132 --> 12:56.932
God, you're perfect.

12:56.967 --> 12:59.133
I'm glad you think so.
I'll factor that in.

13:02.673 --> 13:04.706
Well, there it is.

13:04.741 --> 13:07.642
49% we should act on our attraction,

13:07.678 --> 13:10.044
51% we shouldn't.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.580
Did we factor in my new leather jacket?

13:11.615 --> 13:13.147
Yes, right here.

13:13.183 --> 13:16.416
I was hoping it would change things too.

13:19.154 --> 13:23.056
See you tomorrow, platonic co-worker.

13:23.092 --> 13:24.224
Please don't look back.

13:24.259 --> 13:27.094
Please don't look back.

13:27.129 --> 13:29.296
Damn it.

13:29.331 --> 13:32.665
Good-bye, bad boy.

13:34.302 --> 13:35.969
Wasn't this a good idea?

13:36.004 --> 13:37.003
Absolutely.

13:37.038 --> 13:38.705
Close to the kitchen, bigger TV.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.607
I'm feeling much better.

13:40.642 --> 13:42.809
It's nice to be needed.

13:42.844 --> 13:44.644
Let's drink our tea.

13:47.581 --> 13:50.348
That's whiskey.

13:50.384 --> 13:52.417
Is it?

13:54.121 --> 13:56.154
You know, my mother used
to spoil me like this

13:56.189 --> 13:58.624
when I was sick. Drove my dad nuts.

13:58.659 --> 14:00.325
She was a bit of a free spirit.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.127
One time she pulled me out of school

14:02.162 --> 14:05.630
because it was too nice
a day to stay inside.

14:05.665 --> 14:07.498
Where's your mother now?

14:07.534 --> 14:10.200
I don't know. She left when I was a kid.

14:10.236 --> 14:12.202
She was more into causes and movements

14:12.238 --> 14:13.738
than marriage and motherhood.

14:13.773 --> 14:16.908
She's reached out a few times, but...

14:16.943 --> 14:18.876
I didn't want it.

14:18.912 --> 14:21.878
What kind of a mother
leaves her little boy?

14:21.914 --> 14:23.379
Exactly.

14:25.817 --> 14:28.317
I feel a little tired.

14:37.696 --> 14:40.062
What the!

14:41.732 --> 14:44.833
Shh. I just got him down.

14:49.131 --> 14:50.831
What the hell's going on here?

14:50.866 --> 14:53.467
What? What happened?

14:53.503 --> 14:56.770
The bad lady woke you up.

14:56.805 --> 14:57.738
That's it, Sandy.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.273
I cannot take this for
one second longer.

15:00.308 --> 15:02.909
Get out of my house!
Nobody wants you here!

15:02.944 --> 15:05.145
I need to talk to Sandy.

15:05.180 --> 15:06.979
Sandy, I need to talk to you.

15:07.015 --> 15:07.947
No, me first.

15:07.982 --> 15:09.382
Nate and I ran all the variables,

15:09.418 --> 15:10.683
and it said we shouldn't be together,

15:10.718 --> 15:11.851
and now I'm miserable.

15:11.886 --> 15:12.852
That's nothing.

15:12.887 --> 15:13.986
Sandy, I went to the church,

15:14.022 --> 15:16.022
and Alice isn't at Bible study at all!

15:16.057 --> 15:17.389
You know what? That's it, guys.

15:17.425 --> 15:18.357
Stop.

15:18.392 --> 15:19.891
She's mine.

15:21.762 --> 15:24.063
There's the adulteress.

15:24.098 --> 15:25.931
Shame.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.533
What?

15:27.568 --> 15:29.401
The wife is black?

15:29.437 --> 15:32.604
Oh, I didn't picture that.

15:32.639 --> 15:34.272
What did you picture?

15:34.307 --> 15:35.806
Me.

15:37.810 --> 15:39.143
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello!

15:39.179 --> 15:40.744
I've got to talk to my mother.

15:40.780 --> 15:43.281
- Those are my suitcases.
- They are!

15:43.316 --> 15:46.650
I've discovered a new me, and
she's better without you.

15:46.686 --> 15:48.119
I always thought I'd put you in a home.

15:48.154 --> 15:50.920
Turns out, it's this one.

15:50.956 --> 15:52.889
Fine. I'll live here forever.

15:52.924 --> 15:54.091
That's enough.

15:54.126 --> 15:56.859
I am gonna take care of
all of this right now.

15:56.895 --> 15:59.296
First, Shea, gun to your head,

15:59.331 --> 16:01.198
what's the most important
thing to you right now?

16:01.233 --> 16:04.033
Getting the gun away from my head.

16:04.069 --> 16:05.835
No, don't think, just react.

16:05.870 --> 16:06.970
Your career or this boy?

16:07.005 --> 16:07.936
My career.

16:07.972 --> 16:09.438
There's your answer.

16:09.474 --> 16:10.539
Bob.

16:10.575 --> 16:12.841
Stop projecting your fears on to Alice

16:12.876 --> 16:14.743
and just ask her where she's been going.

16:14.778 --> 16:17.846
All right, Jezebel...

16:17.881 --> 16:19.648
where have you been going?

16:19.683 --> 16:21.883
Fine, I'll confess.

16:21.919 --> 16:23.319
I've been going bowling.

16:23.354 --> 16:24.486
Bowling!

16:24.521 --> 16:25.820
Yeah, I didn't want to tell you

16:25.855 --> 16:28.156
because the team doesn't
want you back this year.

16:28.191 --> 16:31.025
You yell at everybody.
You made Denise cry.

16:31.060 --> 16:32.660
Well, she's a terrible player.

16:32.695 --> 16:36.264
She's in a wheelchair.

16:36.299 --> 16:40.135
I thought they liked to
be treated the same!

16:40.170 --> 16:44.438
Okay, bottom line is Alice
is not having an affair.

16:44.473 --> 16:46.406
Good to know. Well, enjoy my mother.

16:46.442 --> 16:48.175
No, no, no! Wait.

16:48.210 --> 16:50.277
You say you're "a new me"?

16:50.312 --> 16:51.612
But isn't that what your mother's

16:51.647 --> 16:53.180
been telling you all along?

16:53.215 --> 16:54.515
That you need to fix yourself up

16:54.550 --> 16:56.216
and get yourself out there again?

16:57.786 --> 16:59.318
I suppose.

16:59.354 --> 17:03.356
And Sandy, what do you
think of this new Gwen?

17:03.391 --> 17:05.324
- You look like...
- What?

17:05.359 --> 17:06.759
A poorly dressed mannequin?

17:06.794 --> 17:09.162
An ad for a depressing dating website

17:09.196 --> 17:10.530
for the elderly divorced?

17:10.565 --> 17:12.464
A hooker from Cleveland?

17:12.500 --> 17:15.867
Just say it!

17:15.902 --> 17:17.801
You look beautiful

17:17.837 --> 17:19.871
and happy.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.674
Well, thank you.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.976
You see? It's simple.

17:25.011 --> 17:29.514
Sandy, Gwen wants to feel
supported and loved.

17:29.550 --> 17:33.950
And Gwen, your mom wants to feel needed.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.287
I do need you.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.389
And I love you.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.062
Oh, my God.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.297
Emergency, you guys.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.631
They've changed the part.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.599
It's a southern accent now.

17:51.269 --> 17:53.069
Stella, we really need to discuss

17:53.104 --> 17:54.637
the meaning of the word "emergency."

17:54.673 --> 17:56.439
Stella, we really need

17:56.474 --> 17:59.742
to discuss the meaning
of the word emergency.

17:59.777 --> 18:00.910
What?

18:00.945 --> 18:02.044
That's not how I sound!

18:02.080 --> 18:03.045
What?

18:03.081 --> 18:05.114
That's not how I sound!

18:05.149 --> 18:07.216
She has you nailed.

18:07.251 --> 18:08.517
Let's go home.

18:08.552 --> 18:11.886
Or we could go back to
that warehouse party.

18:11.922 --> 18:13.222
Lot of men there.

18:13.257 --> 18:14.556
Anyone my age?

18:14.592 --> 18:15.557
No.

18:15.593 --> 18:16.891
Let's hit it.

18:23.676 --> 18:25.275
How you feeling?

18:25.277 --> 18:26.276
Physically, better,

18:26.278 --> 18:29.580
but I miss Sandy being here.

18:29.582 --> 18:31.816
It's nice having one of those
older ladies in the house

18:31.818 --> 18:33.784
who takes care of you.

18:33.786 --> 18:37.220
A mother?

18:37.222 --> 18:39.756
Yeah, one of those.

18:39.758 --> 18:41.825
Well, do you think maybe
what you're really missing

18:41.827 --> 18:43.159
is your own mother?

18:43.161 --> 18:44.728
Maybe.

18:44.730 --> 18:46.630
You could get in touch with her.

18:46.632 --> 18:48.898
I'm still angry.

18:48.900 --> 18:52.301
You can be angry at someone
and still miss them.

18:52.303 --> 18:53.902
Like Mel Gibson.

18:57.708 --> 19:01.677
I'm angry at him, but I
kind of miss his movies.

19:01.679 --> 19:04.046
He would have been great in "Taken."

19:04.048 --> 19:05.781
You know what Liam Neeson's taken?

19:05.783 --> 19:07.516
Mel Gibson's parts.

19:10.820 --> 19:13.855
Do you think maybe you're deflecting...

19:13.857 --> 19:16.524
to avoid talking about
something painful?

19:16.526 --> 19:20.995
Martina, I really don't want
to be therap-ized by you.

19:20.997 --> 19:23.665
So that's what brought us to you,

19:23.667 --> 19:25.332
to discuss whether or not Mike

19:25.334 --> 19:26.867
should get in touch with his mother.

19:26.869 --> 19:27.934
I see.

19:27.936 --> 19:29.670
Mike, what we need to do now

19:29.672 --> 19:31.071
is explore all the difficult

19:31.073 --> 19:33.073
and contradictory feelings
that come into play

19:33.075 --> 19:35.876
when making such a potentially
life-changing decision.

19:35.878 --> 19:39.012
Yeah, I don't want to do all that.

19:39.014 --> 19:41.782
I'll just call her.

19:45.653 --> 19:48.120
Hey, Mom, it's Mike.

19:48.122 --> 19:51.223
Your son.

19:51.225 --> 19:52.958
It's, uh...

19:52.960 --> 19:55.661
been a long time.

19:55.663 --> 19:57.262
Maybe too long a time.

19:57.264 --> 20:00.799
So if you get this,
please give me a call.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.504
Martina, I know you're
listening at the door.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.505
Not listening.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.741
Just here in case you need me.

20:09.743 --> 20:11.843
Well, what I said was...

20:11.845 --> 20:15.080
I heard the whole thing.

20:15.082 --> 20:16.848
Look, I don't know if
it was the right number

20:16.850 --> 20:18.648
or if I'll ever hear from her,

20:18.650 --> 20:21.752
but I am glad that I did it, so thanks.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.988
You take good care of us.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.326
Well, Nate Johnson, I look forward

20:29.328 --> 20:31.528
to our professional
relationship together.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.130
So do I, Shea Moore.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.372
It seems there's one variable
we neglected to consider,

20:43.374 --> 20:46.909
which is that... that was awesome.

20:46.911 --> 20:49.779
We should consider it again.

20:50.305 --> 20:56.426
