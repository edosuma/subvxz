This is the competition?
Dr. Zach?

00:31.300 --> 00:34.300
Please, it's nothing but suggestive,
smarmy sleaze.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.600
- And he's great at it.
- Roz.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.700
You know, I tell you what.
I give this guy four, five weeks tops.

00:40.900 --> 00:44.200
He's been on the air ten weeks,
and frankly, we're getting spanked.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.100
Oh, he did a whole show on that
yesterday.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.600
FRASIER:
Stop it.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.800

he's the new flavour of the month.

I think this guy's got staying power.

- He did a show on that Tuesday.
- Cut it out, Roz.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.600
Hey, you know, maybe we should
try some of those theme shows.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.500
Actually,
we have done theme shows.

01:10.700 --> 01:14.100
You know, I still get letters about
the show we did on existential angst.

- No, we don't.
- I get them at home.

Well, I'm just saying it wouldn't hurt
to spice things up a little.

You know, mention
people's privates once in a while.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.500
Absolutely not. My show is fine
the way it is. What it needs

01:27.800 --> 01:30.300
is a little support from this station.
How about some advertising?

Whoa, whoa, I don't wanna just
throw money at the problem.

- Thirty seconds, Frasier.
- Right, right.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.100
Well, then how about airing
some more promos on my lead-in?

01:38.300 --> 01:39.500
They get a sizeable audience.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.100
They do. That's why we're
moving them to evening drive time.

- Yeah, they're not too happy about it.

Oh, come on. I'm being good.
I took my cholesterol pill.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.000
Yes. That was the last one.
You better call Dr. Stewart.

02:26.400 --> 02:30.600
Oh, he'll make me go through
a whole physical just to get a refill.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.400
Hey, Niles.
Couldn't you write me a prescription?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.400
- Oh, I can't, Dad. Sorry.
- Why not?

Oh, come on, you see me every day.
You know I'm fine.

Just get your little pad out
and write "more pills."

going to the doctor so much?

02:48.900 --> 02:50.800
- Everybody does.
- Not my brother Billy.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.500
He loved going to the doctor's.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.200
From the time he was a little boy,
he'd start getting undressed in the car.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.400
And, mind you,
that was just for the dentist.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.800
As he got older,
he volunteered for medical studies.

Supported himself getting all sorts of
experimental drugs pumped into him.

- A full-page ad.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.000
"Cuddle up with Dr. Zach."

03:31.100 --> 03:33.900
Yes. As if some airbrushed
picture of a pretty boy

with effective therapy.

Mm. Yet not so much
you hate him for it.

I keep losing to him in the ratings.

to unleash the newest member
of Team Crane.

to address any concerns.

- Doctor who?

For God's sake, Bebe.

And I am just as outraged
as you are.

I see what's going on here. You're
trying to pass me off to your assistant

so you can devote your attention
to your new number one client.

07:39.800 --> 07:43.400
Nonsense. There is no one
more important to me than you.

Frasier, we have done great things,

Would you deny me the chance
to share in that adventure?

- Yes.
- Oh, come on. Don't be selfish.

08:06.100 --> 08:10.500
You'll be fine with Portia.
Don't forget, she reports directly to me.

Bebe, throughout our relationship,
I have put up with a lot,

08:18.100 --> 08:23.300
but I never doubted, for an instant,
your devotion to my career.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.100
Apparently, that is at an end.

08:26.800 --> 08:31.500
And so, therefore,
is my association with this agency.

have that meeting next Tuesday.

I didn't miss her.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.400
I was hiding in the stairwell
till she left.

08:58.300 --> 09:00.100
And Portia is not my new agent.

09:00.400 --> 09:05.500
She is Bebe's minion,
her little winged monkey.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.500
The woman has been hounding me.
I had to turn off my cell phone.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.400

how she got the new number.

Publisher's Clearing House reach you?

09:16.500 --> 09:18.100
She seemed quite insistent.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.200
- She sounds like a real go-getter.
FRASIER: I don't care if she is.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.100
It'll be a cold day in hell
before I go back to Bebe's agency.

Well, uh, you're not gonna send back
the flowers and muffins, are you?

09:30.200 --> 09:34.700
- I don't see any muffins.
- I mean, if she had sent muffins.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.400
Don't worry, Dad,
there will be muffins aplenty.

to start ringing right off the hook.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.300
I know, but how great
would that have been?

09:56.500 --> 09:58.600
You say, "Phone's gonna start ringing,"
and boom.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.400
FRASIER:
Yes, yes, yes.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.000
The truth is I'm excited.

I'm excited
about having a new agent.
