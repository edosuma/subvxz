a social order yet?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.081
Where's your most popular
camper?

18:44.081 --> 18:45.416
Maya! Kenny!

18:45.416 --> 18:47.668
Hello! Hold on.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.879
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:49.879 --> 18:53.007
You didn't want a scene,
but I had to come.

18:53.007 --> 18:56.594
I tried to find a reason that
you'd need me, and I couldn't.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.180
So...I came for me.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.599
I needed to see you.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.518
I needed to see this,
and I needed to say goodbye.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.688
So, I'm sorry if you don't want
me here, but I came for <i>me.</i>

19:09.398 --> 19:13.319
"I want you ‐‐"
H‐E ‐‐ "here."

19:13.319 --> 19:17.698
And that is why I came,
for <i>you.</i>

19:24.622 --> 19:26.457
This moment brought to you
by Summer Kenneth.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.459
I asked
for two minutes.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.504
Anyway, all of the girls at
my school talk to each other.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.965
Why am I telling you how every
girl I meet doesn't like me?

19:34.965 --> 19:36.759
Not that I want you
to like me.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.761
I like you as a friend,
maybe more.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.721
I don't want to rule
anything out.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.723
Remember when I helped you
open that wheelchair?

19:42.723 --> 19:44.266
That sure was nice.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.185
I like you, too.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.104
As a friend.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.730
With nothing ruled out.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.692
Oi, Ray!
Time to go.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.193
Already?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.736
Maybe we can meet after camp.
Where do you live?

19:55.736 --> 19:57.321
California.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.199
I live in California,
Orange County!

20:00.199 --> 20:01.951
What?
I live in Orange County!

20:01.951 --> 20:03.452
This is unbelievable!

20:06.288 --> 20:08.666
Listen, Taylor,
I know this is fast,

20:08.666 --> 20:12.420
but will you be my summer
pen‐pal girlfriend?

20:12.420 --> 20:15.506
Oh.

20:15.506 --> 20:20.177
Actually, I already have
a summer pen‐pal boyfriend...

20:20.177 --> 20:22.096
...is what I'll tell
the next guy who asks

20:22.096 --> 20:23.389
'cause I'm your pen‐pal.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.057
You faked me out!

20:25.057 --> 20:26.809
Your sense of humor
is as wicked as mine!

20:26.809 --> 20:28.018
I love us!

20:41.490 --> 20:44.660
"Thanks
for bringing me here.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.414
I'm sorry I was
a jerk about it."

20:48.414 --> 20:50.332
I'm glad you were.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.169
It kept me from being sad
until this very moment.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.088
‐We love you, buddy.
‐You'll have fun.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.466
Yeah,
but not too much fun.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.926
You got this, baby boy.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.814
JJ!

21:13.814 --> 21:15.191
JJ!

21:20.654 --> 21:23.115
I have a girlfriend!
