WEBVTT

00:03.750 --> 00:07.285
(knocking)

00:07.353 --> 00:08.553
Are you ready to run?

00:08.620 --> 00:09.970
I have my playlist
all ready.

00:09.972 --> 00:12.408
Actually, it's
Diane Keaton's autobiography,

00:12.476 --> 00:13.942
and she just filmed
<i>First Wives Club,</i>

00:14.010 --> 00:15.011
and it's getting me pumped!

00:15.079 --> 00:16.879
I totally forgot
we were going to run today.

00:16.947 --> 00:18.681
I e-mailed you,
like, three times.

00:18.749 --> 00:20.349
Maybe you typed
"gmoil" again.

00:20.417 --> 00:22.083
No more excuses--
we have to train.

00:22.151 --> 00:23.451
We signed up
for this charity run

00:23.519 --> 00:24.519
and now we have to do it.

00:24.587 --> 00:26.088
Why can't we just
donate the money?

00:26.155 --> 00:28.523
Why do we have to run
the six miles first?

00:28.591 --> 00:30.358
That's a good point,
but, no, you're gonna go...

00:30.426 --> 00:31.459
Oh, no, Jess,
look, I can't go.

00:31.527 --> 00:33.561
I am super hungover
right now.

00:33.630 --> 00:35.796
Plus, Masha had
a bit of a crisis.

00:35.864 --> 00:37.565
She accidentally
ate a cookie.

00:37.633 --> 00:39.000
- What?
- Because she fell on it.

00:39.067 --> 00:40.167
I am devastated.

00:40.235 --> 00:42.069
She is devastated.

00:42.137 --> 00:43.671
Well, why don't you
come running with us?

00:43.739 --> 00:45.606
- No, she definitely can't.
- You can run off that cookie.

00:45.674 --> 00:47.174
- It's great.
- You know what? We will

00:47.242 --> 00:49.110
- do it tomorrow, I promise.
- It's more money for charity.

00:49.177 --> 00:50.711
It'll be so fun.

00:52.647 --> 00:53.480
(gasps)

00:53.548 --> 00:55.648
I mean, that was
a close one.

00:55.715 --> 00:56.815
Good thing
I'm a quiet breather.

00:56.883 --> 00:57.817
I learned that as a kid

00:57.884 --> 00:58.918
playing "Who passed out?"
with my mom.

00:58.986 --> 00:59.919
(chuckles)

00:59.987 --> 01:01.387
My mom always won.

01:01.455 --> 01:04.290
Jew in the couch,
Jew in the couch.

01:04.358 --> 01:05.692
(giggles)

01:05.760 --> 01:07.894
Nadia, American manners.

01:07.962 --> 01:08.895
Sorry.

01:08.963 --> 01:11.596
Jew-Jew person in couch.

01:13.332 --> 01:14.933
She's not wrong.

01:22.475 --> 01:23.508
(door opens)

01:23.576 --> 01:25.310
WOMAN:
Okay, bye, Nick.

01:25.378 --> 01:27.712
So you'll call me?

01:27.780 --> 01:30.214
Um, yeah, yeah,
I'll definitely...

01:30.282 --> 01:31.215
(coughing)

01:31.283 --> 01:32.383
Are you, are you okay?

01:32.450 --> 01:33.484
I'm gonna call you.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.619
(coughing)
Um, okay.

01:35.688 --> 01:37.421
Do you hike?
Do you hike?

01:37.489 --> 01:38.556
(coughing)

01:38.623 --> 01:40.524
- Okay, I...
- This was fun.

01:40.592 --> 01:43.293
Okay, I'll call you tonight
to make sure you're okay?

01:43.360 --> 01:44.360
Please.

01:44.428 --> 01:46.462
(coughing)

01:49.067 --> 01:51.001
That was ridiculous.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.402
I can't do this, Winston.

01:52.469 --> 01:53.636
I don't know
how to sleep

01:53.705 --> 01:55.338
with 21-year-old girls,

01:55.406 --> 01:56.740
and for the last couple weeks,
that's all

01:56.808 --> 01:58.107
I've been doing.

01:58.175 --> 01:59.541
What's going on with you?
Are you okay?

01:59.609 --> 02:01.043
I saw something
a few days ago.

02:01.611 --> 02:02.878
Now, I've been
sworn to secrecy,

02:02.946 --> 02:05.480
- but it is just too big.
- You know I can't keep a secret,

02:05.548 --> 02:07.883
- I can't lie, Winston. You saw me with
that girl. - Don't leave me like this.

02:07.951 --> 02:09.151
Even thinking
about keeping a secret

02:09.219 --> 02:11.821
turns my back
into a Slip 'n Slide.

02:11.888 --> 02:13.689
Come on, man, you got to help
me out, okay? I'm dying.

02:13.756 --> 02:15.690
- I don't want to know.
- Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on...

02:15.758 --> 02:17.759
- I'm dying! I'm dying, man!
- I don't want to know.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.194
I don't want to know!

02:19.261 --> 02:21.196
Cece and Schmidt are
sleeping together!

02:25.434 --> 02:27.936
Ew.

02:28.003 --> 02:29.637
(groans)

02:34.307 --> 02:35.342
It's happening

02:35.409 --> 02:36.877
- under our roof.
- No.

02:36.945 --> 02:37.477
- Yes.
- No.

02:37.545 --> 02:38.511
Yes!

02:38.579 --> 02:39.880
This makes me
hate things.

02:39.948 --> 02:42.116
I know, man.
It's like up is down.

02:42.183 --> 02:43.683
Up is the new down, man.

02:43.752 --> 02:46.418
Now my back is sweating.

02:46.486 --> 02:47.720
All right, who knows?

02:47.788 --> 02:48.621
Everybody
but Jess.

02:49.522 --> 02:50.489
Hey.

02:51.307 --> 02:52.223
Hey, Jess.

02:52.225 --> 02:53.259
We're just hanging out
in the hallway.

02:53.326 --> 02:54.593
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.

02:54.661 --> 02:55.895
Yeah, actually,
I'm really annoyed.

02:55.963 --> 02:57.496
Cece bailed on me again.
We were supposed

02:57.564 --> 02:58.731
to train for that race
this weekend.

02:58.799 --> 03:01.367
That is so Cece.

03:01.434 --> 03:02.968
I know... I mean,

03:03.535 --> 03:06.104
and the weird thing is that
she said she was hungover,

03:06.172 --> 03:08.640
but last night she said
she didn't want to go out.

03:10.209 --> 03:11.810
Maybe she had a guy over.

03:11.878 --> 03:13.611
Not like that--
I didn't say anything.

03:13.679 --> 03:15.814
If you think about what I said,
I didn't say anything.

03:16.632 --> 03:17.748
You have a secret.

03:18.116 --> 03:19.183
- You have a secret.
- No, you have a secret.

03:19.251 --> 03:20.717
- Turn around.
- You turn around.

03:20.786 --> 03:21.786
- Let me see your back.
- Please don't.

03:21.853 --> 03:24.121
J- ust be cool about...
- Ew, gross.

03:24.189 --> 03:26.723
<i>J'accuse,</i> Miller,
<i>j'accuse.</i>

03:26.792 --> 03:27.658
You fold
like a lawn chair.

03:27.725 --> 03:29.927
Fold, fold.

03:29.995 --> 03:31.695
(mumbling rapidly) Yes, you-- fold,
fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.

03:31.763 --> 03:33.164
Winston told me Cece and Schmidt
are sleeping together!

03:33.231 --> 03:34.130
- Come on, man!
- What?!

03:34.198 --> 03:37.300
Oh, my God.

03:37.367 --> 03:38.601
They know,
Schmidt.

03:38.669 --> 03:39.702
Sweatback?

03:39.770 --> 03:41.805
You told Sweatback?
Come on, Winston.

03:42.372 --> 03:43.639
- Jess.
- God.

03:43.707 --> 03:48.144
I am so sorry that you had
to hear about this like this.

03:48.212 --> 03:50.478
But, I mean, can we just take
a moment to celebrate me?

03:50.546 --> 03:51.880
Schmidtty really did it
this time.

03:51.948 --> 03:53.548
I mean,
I'm having Indian every night.

03:53.616 --> 03:55.383
- No, no!
- Whoa, whoa!

03:55.451 --> 03:56.584
(Jess screaming)

04:00.356 --> 04:02.724
Jess, I'm really sorry
you found out this way,

04:02.792 --> 04:03.859
okay, but trust
me, it wasn't

04:03.927 --> 04:06.360
some big conspiracy.

04:06.428 --> 04:08.395
It was just something that happened
and then it got out of control,

04:08.463 --> 04:09.831
sort of like
poison oak

04:09.898 --> 04:11.498
and I just couldn't
stop scratching it.

04:11.566 --> 04:12.700
Cece started it.

04:12.767 --> 04:15.169
That's...

04:15.737 --> 04:16.904
I did, I started it.

04:16.971 --> 04:19.606
Why, Cece? Are you trying
to get back at your parents?

04:19.673 --> 04:20.741
When did it start?

04:20.809 --> 04:22.275
Jess, I want
to emphasize

04:22.343 --> 04:23.944
that we are
not dating.

04:24.011 --> 04:25.145
I can't stress
that enough.

04:25.213 --> 04:26.512
This is
just sex.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.848
Mm-hmm, when did it start?

04:27.915 --> 04:32.219
1:03 a.m., February 15,

04:32.286 --> 04:36.156
right on schedule.

04:36.224 --> 04:37.390
Two months ago.

04:37.458 --> 04:38.958
Two months?

04:39.025 --> 04:40.926
Two moons have passed
since you started doing it?

04:40.994 --> 04:42.361
Why do you start talking
like a Native American

04:42.428 --> 04:43.362
when you get angry?

04:43.429 --> 04:44.696
Two moons have passed!

04:44.764 --> 04:46.298
Just a quick sidebar.

04:46.366 --> 04:47.967
Uh, we've done it in every
room of the apartment.

04:48.034 --> 04:49.634
Ugh, even my room?

04:49.702 --> 04:51.237
- Just the one time.
- Oh, God.

04:51.304 --> 04:52.872
(grunts)
How long have you known?

04:53.239 --> 04:54.072
A few days.

04:54.139 --> 04:55.539
- You didn't tell me either?
- Jess,

04:55.607 --> 04:57.708
just as a reminder, I told you
seconds after I found out.

04:57.776 --> 05:00.511
Because you're weak, Nick, weak.

05:00.579 --> 05:02.347
Okay, I agree.
Just chill out. Stop yelling.

05:02.414 --> 05:04.682
Jess, I want to tell
you everything.

05:04.750 --> 05:05.783
What do you
want to know?

05:05.851 --> 05:07.385
I don't know, Cece.
How would I know

05:07.452 --> 05:08.452
if you're telling
the truth?

05:08.520 --> 05:09.320
SCHMIDT:
Come on, Jess.

05:09.388 --> 05:10.187
Are you seriously mad?

05:10.255 --> 05:11.688
(scoffs)

05:11.756 --> 05:14.791
No, no, I'm not.

05:14.859 --> 05:16.693
I'm really glad
you two are having fun.

05:18.596 --> 05:21.498
How cool is that?

05:24.133 --> 05:25.135
For what it's worth

05:25.203 --> 05:27.270
I think what I did
was really brave.

05:29.072 --> 05:30.306
Oh.

05:30.374 --> 05:31.340
Get off of me.

05:31.408 --> 05:33.276
Yeah.

05:37.310 --> 05:38.410
Hey, have you guys seen a scarf?

05:38.978 --> 05:40.344
Holly said she left it out here.

05:40.412 --> 05:41.746
HOLLY:
It's my favorite scarf

05:41.814 --> 05:43.581
because it's a circle,
so you never have to think

05:43.649 --> 05:45.984
about which end goes
on the right or the left.

05:46.051 --> 05:47.585
My therapist
gave it to me.

05:47.653 --> 05:49.286
She's Asian, but
she's the nicest.

05:49.354 --> 05:52.756
(phone ringing)

05:52.824 --> 05:53.757
Who is that?

05:53.825 --> 05:55.291
Nobody, just...

05:55.359 --> 05:57.661
Who was that?

05:57.729 --> 05:59.262
Was it that
stuck-up bitch

05:59.330 --> 06:00.931
from last night
with the fake hand?

06:00.999 --> 06:02.465
- Whoa.
NICK: No, it was no one.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.635
It was just...
it was just beep-beep-beep.

06:04.702 --> 06:05.636
Was...

06:05.703 --> 06:07.337
I'm so old.

06:07.404 --> 06:09.471
I don't even know
how to use a cell phone.

06:09.539 --> 06:10.539
Come on.
Let's go clubbing.

06:10.607 --> 06:11.741
You want to go clubbing?

06:11.808 --> 06:12.908
HOLLY:
Show me the phone.

06:12.976 --> 06:14.309
Let's go back to when
we were having fun.

06:14.377 --> 06:16.211
- Let me see the phone.
- No, just chill out.

06:16.279 --> 06:17.913
- Let me see your phone.
- No!

06:19.249 --> 06:20.415
Smooth.

06:22.719 --> 06:23.652
I'll call you.

06:23.719 --> 06:24.919
Nick, are you kid...?

06:24.987 --> 06:26.254
What, you keep the ringer on?

06:26.321 --> 06:28.056
Amateur move, man.

06:28.124 --> 06:29.691
Yeah, I'm just in over my head.

06:29.759 --> 06:32.827
Schmidt, I hate asking you this,
but how do you do this?

06:32.895 --> 06:34.495
Oh, glory be, are you
asking for my help?

06:34.563 --> 06:36.031
Oh, I-I'm flattered.

06:36.098 --> 06:37.932
Pull up, pull up, Nick.
Yank back on that yoke.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.233
We have to face
the reality of the situation.

06:40.301 --> 06:43.170
Schmidt has been having
consensual sex with Cece

06:43.237 --> 06:45.105
and lying about it.

06:45.173 --> 06:46.206
He's better

06:46.274 --> 06:47.675
than us at this, Winston,

06:47.742 --> 06:49.710
and I hate it as much as you do,

06:49.778 --> 06:50.678
and, Schmidt, I
hate saying this,

06:50.745 --> 06:51.912
but I might...

06:53.614 --> 06:54.648
I might respect you.

06:54.716 --> 06:56.182
Thank you
for saying that.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.984
You've come a long way, man.

06:58.052 --> 06:59.318
Since my 20s,
I've had

06:59.386 --> 07:01.054
a string of lesser paramours

07:01.121 --> 07:02.388
which,
like weathered

07:02.455 --> 07:05.591
stone steps, have led me
to the Hindu temple,

07:05.659 --> 07:08.127
a.k.a. Cece,
because she's Indian.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.563
(both moaning)

07:10.630 --> 07:12.664
You don't have to be
so gentle with me.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.099
(both grunting)

07:14.167 --> 07:15.500
All right, oh, that's
how I like it, baby.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.635
All right.

07:18.204 --> 07:21.307
Sex, man.
It's the real stuff.

07:22.374 --> 07:24.209
I don't know
that I should help you.

07:24.276 --> 07:25.677
You're not a player.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.245
You're a clingy
serial monogamist

07:27.313 --> 07:30.948
with-- well, with a
terrible metabolism.

07:31.016 --> 07:34.051
Schmidt, I need you...

07:35.953 --> 07:37.554
...to teach me
to be a douchebag.

07:37.622 --> 07:39.489
- Let's get to work.
- What's happening in the world?

07:42.159 --> 07:43.660
Hey, babe.

07:43.728 --> 07:45.161
Oh, hey, Cece.

07:45.229 --> 07:46.362
Doing some
stretches?

07:46.430 --> 07:47.296
Good guess, model.

07:47.364 --> 07:48.431
No, just limbering up

07:48.498 --> 07:49.632
in case I want
to have sex

07:49.700 --> 07:51.735
with one
of your roommates.

07:51.802 --> 07:52.936
Do you want some company?

07:53.003 --> 07:54.470
What?

07:54.538 --> 07:56.940
- Do you want some company?
- I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

07:57.007 --> 07:58.108
Diane Keaton
is talking

07:58.175 --> 08:00.743
about her rich life
full of loyal friends.

08:00.810 --> 08:02.044
Oh, Jess,

08:02.112 --> 08:03.278
I hate when we fight.

08:03.346 --> 08:04.847
I get so
stressed out.

08:04.914 --> 08:06.215
I mean, my eye
twitches back.

08:06.282 --> 08:07.816
I'm eating bread,
all right?

08:08.384 --> 08:10.052
Just let me come
on this run with you.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.120
No!

08:11.187 --> 08:12.087
Seriously, Jess,

08:12.155 --> 08:13.856
it was just one secret.

08:13.923 --> 08:15.590
Everybody has got secrets.

08:15.658 --> 08:16.791
Good afternoon.

08:16.859 --> 08:19.493
Uh, my name is
Mr. Schmidt. M-R...

08:19.561 --> 08:21.195
Not even a real
chalkboard.

08:21.763 --> 08:23.731
First of all, Nick, congrats.

08:23.799 --> 08:25.366
- Thank you.
- You're meeting a lot of young women,

08:25.433 --> 08:27.334
and for whatever reason,
they seem to,

08:27.402 --> 08:28.736
you know,
find you appealing.

08:28.804 --> 08:29.971
In the restaurant of life,

08:30.038 --> 08:32.304
you have selected
the tasting menu.

08:32.373 --> 08:33.840
Okay, I changed my mind.
I don't want to do this any more.

08:33.908 --> 08:35.475
Nick, you're terrible
at lying,

08:35.542 --> 08:37.844
so what we want to do is,
we want to focus on

08:37.912 --> 08:39.813
S.S.V.

08:39.881 --> 08:41.114
I cannot believe
you slept with Cece.

08:41.182 --> 08:42.948
- Short, simple...
- Vagina.

08:43.017 --> 08:44.818
Vague. It's actually...
it's actually vague.

08:44.886 --> 08:47.187
Let's apply it. I'm one of these
young girls that's coming in here.

08:47.255 --> 08:49.755
- I want to party. I'm in college.
Let's do this. - I'm in.

08:49.823 --> 08:50.722
Hey, what happened
to your phone?

08:50.791 --> 08:52.457
Jesus took it.

08:52.525 --> 08:54.059
A Jesus hawk
on a speedboat.

08:54.127 --> 08:55.060
The environment.

08:55.128 --> 08:56.695
Bears, family, magic.

08:56.763 --> 08:58.230
Mm-hmm.

08:58.298 --> 08:59.731
- I need your help, Schmidt.
- Yeah.

09:01.134 --> 09:02.334
I'm the girl, and
the whole objective

09:02.402 --> 09:03.669
is to get me out
of the front door

09:03.736 --> 09:06.104
as fast as you
possibly can.

09:06.172 --> 09:07.338
Let's do this.

09:07.406 --> 09:08.873
- Ready?
- Yeah.

09:08.941 --> 09:10.641
- What's your name?
- My name is Janine, all right?

09:11.209 --> 09:12.076
God.

09:12.144 --> 09:14.478
(sighs)

09:14.546 --> 09:16.281
- Don't make that sound.
- Good morning, Nick.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.648
You really gave it
to me good last night.

09:17.716 --> 09:19.117
You gave me the
full business, yeah.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.384
This is really weird,
Schmidt.

09:21.452 --> 09:23.420
It's one of the weirder things
we've done, right?

09:23.487 --> 09:25.189
What you thinking, brown eyes?
Want to grab some brunch?

09:25.256 --> 09:27.057
Sure, Janine,
that sounds fun.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.159
God-- no, you don't want to grab brunch.
(stammering)

09:29.227 --> 09:30.327
- Okay.
- Come on, damn it, Nick.

09:30.394 --> 09:31.561
- I'm all turned around.
- Focus.

09:31.629 --> 09:32.562
I just had sex
with Janine.

09:32.630 --> 09:33.530
I have feelings
for her.

09:33.597 --> 09:34.998
Yeah, so you're done.

09:35.066 --> 09:36.866
Oh, I just sleep with her
and then kick her out

09:36.934 --> 09:38.534
like she's
a piece of meat?

09:38.601 --> 09:40.436
- This is the problem.
- All right, ask me again, Schmidt.

09:40.503 --> 09:42.771
Okay, cowboy, want to
saddle up and go again?

09:42.840 --> 09:44.807
- No, sweetie, I can't.
- Good-- why can't you?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.309
- I got things to do.
I got plans. - You have work.

09:46.376 --> 09:47.877
Plans can
be canceled.

09:47.945 --> 09:49.212
JESS: I don't want to
live in a house of lies.

09:49.279 --> 09:51.180
I can't do
it any more.

09:52.248 --> 09:53.414
Is this
happening, too?

09:53.482 --> 09:54.749
- No, this is not happening.
- No, this is not happening.

09:54.817 --> 09:56.584
This isn't what
it looks like.

09:56.652 --> 09:59.487
Okay, look, fine, from now on,
we are going to be open

09:59.555 --> 10:00.856
and honest
in this loft,

10:00.923 --> 10:02.123
and that means that
I have some secrets

10:02.191 --> 10:03.791
I want to get
off my chest.

10:03.860 --> 10:05.493
- I'd rather not hear those.
- Nobody wants to hear these.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.462
Schmidt, a couple months ago
I found Nick

10:07.529 --> 10:09.964
using your chenille throw
as a napkin.

10:10.031 --> 10:12.299
That is a microfiber blend
from Pakistan, you heathen.

10:12.367 --> 10:14.634
- Stop quoting the catalog like a weirdo.
- Each heirloom-quality...

10:14.702 --> 10:16.237
Good, this is healthy.
Air it out.

10:16.304 --> 10:17.905
All right,
one more.

10:17.973 --> 10:19.940
Schmidt said that
Winston is in danger

10:20.008 --> 10:21.308
of becoming a
nanny for life.

10:21.376 --> 10:23.443
He said you were
going "full Poppins."

10:23.511 --> 10:24.878
Okay, Winston,
I can see

10:24.945 --> 10:26.145
anger in your eyes.

10:26.213 --> 10:27.446
Schmidt said he thinks
about you sometimes

10:27.514 --> 10:28.447
when he's making
love to himself.

10:28.515 --> 10:29.949
- What?
- One time.

10:30.017 --> 10:31.150
What?!

10:31.218 --> 10:32.685
I thought about bangs

10:32.753 --> 10:34.787
and your face
just appeared beneath them.

10:34.855 --> 10:36.256
Okay, by the way,

10:36.323 --> 10:37.723
like I'm the only one.

10:37.791 --> 10:39.925
Nick told me it
happened to him,

10:39.993 --> 10:41.593
- like, like, a bunch of times.
- Winston,

10:41.660 --> 10:43.295
you told me the first week
you got back from Latvia,

10:43.363 --> 10:45.597
you had a sex dream about Jess,
and she had raccoon hands.

10:45.664 --> 10:47.599
- Dreams do not count.
- You've all thought about me

10:47.666 --> 10:50.135
- while self-completing?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:50.203 --> 10:52.070
Look, Jess,

10:52.138 --> 10:53.071
it's not that big a deal.

10:53.139 --> 10:54.439
Really, it's,

10:54.507 --> 10:55.840
it's the sincerest
form of flattery.

10:55.908 --> 10:57.875
We're going back
to keeping secrets.

10:57.943 --> 11:00.011
When I walk through this
door and into my room,

11:00.078 --> 11:01.279
this conversation
never happened.

11:02.447 --> 11:05.716
Oh, my God!

11:06.484 --> 11:08.286
So, what did the
raccoon hands look like?

11:08.353 --> 11:11.422
Oh, man, they were digging
through the garbage.

11:11.489 --> 11:13.089
(Jess screams)

11:17.837 --> 11:20.206
(yawning)

11:24.009 --> 11:24.910
Oh, my God!

11:24.978 --> 11:26.612
Do not drink
my almond milk

11:26.679 --> 11:30.015
when you spent the whole
night drinking Schmidt.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.283
Why are you dressed
like a Mexican wrestler?

11:32.351 --> 11:33.518
Because Cece,

11:33.586 --> 11:35.353
I don't want to live
in a world with secrets.

11:35.421 --> 11:36.988
And that means
that I now know

11:37.055 --> 11:38.756
my three roommates
have all thought about me

11:38.824 --> 11:40.258
while self-completing.

11:40.326 --> 11:41.859
So, I'm gonna wear
my winter clothes

11:41.927 --> 11:43.227
until I can deal
with that fact.

11:43.294 --> 11:44.328
But it's better
than not knowing.

11:44.395 --> 11:46.764
- Is it really better?
- Yeah, it is.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.198
Jess, I don't want to fight
with you any more, okay?

11:48.266 --> 11:50.701
I said I was sorry.

11:50.769 --> 11:52.503
We tell each other everything.
We always have.

11:52.570 --> 11:54.071
I've never not
told you something.

11:54.139 --> 11:56.540
That's what second
base means?

11:56.608 --> 11:58.742
Then I'm not a
virgin any more.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.513
Is it weird that he wants me

12:02.580 --> 12:04.148
to talk in a deep voice
and call myself Kevin?

12:05.216 --> 12:09.186
I had a dream
that I killed you.

12:09.254 --> 12:11.655
<i>You</i> tell <i>me</i> everything,
all right?

12:11.722 --> 12:14.690
I stopped telling you everything
because every time I did,

12:14.758 --> 12:17.893
- you got so judgmental and critical.
- What?!

12:17.961 --> 12:19.828
I had to give it a try, Jess.

12:19.896 --> 12:22.498
I mean, that was the same hand
that was inside Elmo.

12:22.566 --> 12:23.966
Cece.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.335
Okay, yeah, you got me.

12:26.403 --> 12:28.003
You don't have secrets, Jess,

12:28.071 --> 12:29.937
because you never do
anything stupid.

12:30.005 --> 12:32.140
- Look at me!
- With guys.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.609
So, living with Spencer
for six years was not a mistake?

12:34.677 --> 12:36.110
Cece, I'm not
judging you.

12:36.179 --> 12:38.580
It's just... Schmidt?

12:38.648 --> 12:40.282
Judging. See what that is?

12:40.349 --> 12:42.350
No. I'm not judging until now.

12:42.418 --> 12:43.951
Don't look at me!

12:44.019 --> 12:45.419
Oh, Jess, would you please!

12:45.487 --> 12:47.921
A winter hat is not gonna
make us stop thinking

12:47.989 --> 12:49.956
about you from time to time
when we delight ourselves.

12:50.024 --> 12:51.492
Oh, no!

12:51.560 --> 12:53.093
Hey, could you guys keep it
down? I have a lady visitor.

12:54.028 --> 12:54.695
Hi, Nick.

12:54.762 --> 12:56.297
Oh, I get it.

12:56.364 --> 12:57.864
It's actually kind of
a fantasy of mine.

12:57.932 --> 12:59.733
Can you say the following words
out loud?

12:59.801 --> 13:01.267
"The ice roads
are too dangerous!

13:01.335 --> 13:02.868
You're gonna have
to turn back, Chief."

13:02.936 --> 13:05.171
I'm not saying that.
(knocking)

13:05.239 --> 13:06.706
NICK:
Okay.

13:07.573 --> 13:08.441
I want my scarf.

13:08.509 --> 13:10.610
It is 62 degrees out,
and I am freezing.

13:10.678 --> 13:13.513
No. I had work.
I-I have plans. I...

13:13.581 --> 13:15.815
- Get in there! Come on!
- Can I just pay you for the scarf?

13:15.882 --> 13:19.084
Fine. $25.

13:19.151 --> 13:20.785
25...! No, I'll just
help you look for it.

13:20.853 --> 13:24.723
LENA:
Nick, where'd you go?

13:24.790 --> 13:26.558
Are you kidding me?
No, no, no. It's a bear.

13:26.626 --> 13:28.059
There's a magic bear in there!
That's all it is

13:28.127 --> 13:29.160
is a magic bear.
Just stop. Just...

13:29.229 --> 13:30.562
- Hey, Nick.
- Who is this?

13:30.630 --> 13:32.364
Can I have
this circle scarf?

13:32.932 --> 13:34.098
It's my scarf.

13:34.165 --> 13:36.601
No.

13:36.668 --> 13:39.637
HOLLY: It's my scarf!
It's mine! (gasps)

13:39.705 --> 13:41.272
It's mine!
It's mine!

13:41.340 --> 13:42.940
Nick, I just
want you to know

13:43.007 --> 13:44.875
that I am not
judging you right now.

13:44.943 --> 13:46.210
Oh, yeah.
Right, sure.

13:46.278 --> 13:47.678
Ladies, let's not do this.

13:47.746 --> 13:49.446
At least not
with our shirts on.

13:49.513 --> 13:50.947
Do you know how many things
I haven't told you?

13:51.014 --> 13:52.582
Nol I don't,
because, apparently,

13:52.650 --> 13:54.384
I don't know you at all.

13:54.452 --> 13:56.119
Are you running
a 10K tomorrow?

13:56.186 --> 13:58.788
Who knows? Are you even
against MS any more?

13:58.856 --> 13:59.756
- Beats me!
NICK: Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:59.823 --> 14:01.224
They've stopped
hitting each other,

14:01.291 --> 14:02.325
and they're just hitting me!

14:02.393 --> 14:04.160
All right, you want
to go? This New Year's,

14:04.228 --> 14:05.461
I wasn't at my
parents' house.

14:05.528 --> 14:07.296
I was down in St. Barths

14:07.364 --> 14:09.632
with a guy who might
be an arms dealer.

14:09.699 --> 14:11.634
And my feet aren't
whiter than yours.

14:11.701 --> 14:14.803
I just told you that
to make you feel better.

14:14.871 --> 14:17.205
And when we were
ten years old,

14:17.274 --> 14:19.174
I went to the movie <i>My Girl</i>

14:19.242 --> 14:22.443
with Jessica P
before I saw it with you!

14:22.511 --> 14:24.245
NICK:
Ow! Ow! Ow!

14:24.313 --> 14:26.347
And... I own a motorcycle.

14:26.415 --> 14:28.048
Jessica P?!

14:28.116 --> 14:30.251
Jessica freaking P?

14:30.319 --> 14:33.120
- Oh, my God, are you crying
under there now?! - No! No!

14:33.188 --> 14:34.722
- I think you are.
- No, I am not.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.123
(Holly and Lena yelling)
All right, everybody stop!

14:36.191 --> 14:38.057
Wherever you are

14:38.125 --> 14:40.059
right now, just sit down!

14:40.127 --> 14:42.696
Okay, now, Saturday

14:42.764 --> 14:44.063
is a day for sleeping,

14:44.131 --> 14:45.131
and damn it, you will not

14:45.199 --> 14:46.199
take that away from me!

14:46.267 --> 14:47.566
You-- give her her scarf back.

14:47.634 --> 14:50.637
Finders keepers is not a thing.

14:50.705 --> 14:52.071
You-- get out of my house!

14:52.139 --> 14:53.106
Who are you?

14:53.174 --> 14:54.940
Who am I?

14:55.008 --> 14:58.611
Who am I? Well, I am
Theodore K. Mullins.

14:58.679 --> 15:00.846
And Nick is my lover
on the down low.

15:00.914 --> 15:03.683
Tell her, Nick.
Tell her how it really

15:03.750 --> 15:06.419
goes down in apartment 4D.

15:06.486 --> 15:08.487
Oh, great Negro spiritual,

15:08.555 --> 15:10.722
please come down
and loose these chains

15:10.790 --> 15:12.223
on this woman!

15:12.291 --> 15:13.825
Flesh on flesh.

15:13.892 --> 15:14.826
When the lights are off,

15:14.893 --> 15:15.993
we are all
the same.

15:16.061 --> 15:17.094
Not true.

15:17.162 --> 15:19.096
Dear lord, help me, Father!

15:21.099 --> 15:22.166
Get out of my house.

15:22.234 --> 15:23.435
Get out

15:23.502 --> 15:24.669
of my house!

15:24.737 --> 15:26.002
- Yeah. I'm out.
- I'm leaving.

15:26.070 --> 15:27.471
Hey, can you
give me a ride?

15:27.539 --> 15:29.039
- Get out.
- I'm gonna stop and get a manicure.

15:29.106 --> 15:30.741
- Do you want to...?
- Okay. Yeah.

15:30.809 --> 15:32.643
You told Harpo
to beat me?

15:32.711 --> 15:33.944
Bye, guys.

15:34.011 --> 15:35.446
You want them over me?

15:35.513 --> 15:37.381
Over me?! You...

15:37.449 --> 15:40.384
You're sweating so much,
it looks like rain, and you...

15:40.452 --> 15:42.284
You, you're peaking, man.

15:42.353 --> 15:43.853
You're at the prime
of your life. That's actually...

15:43.920 --> 15:47.390
Cece, get rid of the motorcycle!
And Jess, don't act like

15:47.458 --> 15:49.325
you haven't thought about us,
too, when you're going solo.

15:49.393 --> 15:52.027
Okay? I don't work a
9:00-to-5:00. I'm here all day.

15:52.095 --> 15:53.329
I can hear you!

15:53.397 --> 15:54.697
Now, go away,

15:54.765 --> 15:57.199
because I'm... having cereal.

SCHMIDT:
Oh, boy, look at her glisten!

16:36.136 --> 16:37.704
Oh, Cece.

16:37.772 --> 16:39.873
That sports bra is doing
God's work right now.

16:39.940 --> 16:43.109
- Two months. - I can't stop.
I got to beat Jess.

16:43.826 --> 16:45.244
What are you...?
What is wrong with you, sir?

16:45.312 --> 16:46.612
That is Cece's water!

16:46.679 --> 16:48.079
You animal!

16:48.147 --> 16:49.214
This thing with our girls
has gotten out of control.

16:49.782 --> 16:50.682
Our girls?

16:50.750 --> 16:52.317
Yeah, it makes me really sad

16:52.385 --> 16:54.219
to see them fighting
over me like this.

16:54.287 --> 16:55.821
Then why are you smiling?

16:55.889 --> 16:58.056
(panting): Have you guys...
seen... Cece?

16:58.124 --> 16:59.458
Yeah, she's way
down there.

16:59.526 --> 17:01.192
Hasn't even
broken a sweat.

17:01.260 --> 17:03.594
Jess, okay.
Jess, arms up.

17:03.662 --> 17:05.930
Arms up. I need you
long and loose like sea grass.

17:05.997 --> 17:08.665
Moving. Move...
(grunts)

17:08.733 --> 17:10.635
(Winston and Nick groan) Oh, my God, why?!
- I'm sorry.

17:10.702 --> 17:12.069
I'm just mad at you.

17:12.137 --> 17:14.638
My adrenaline is going.

17:14.705 --> 17:16.406
(panting)

17:17.474 --> 17:18.708
Did you make that?

17:18.776 --> 17:21.578
- What?
- And Cece let you wear it?

17:21.646 --> 17:22.979
What? She thought it was funny.

17:26.415 --> 17:28.151
Cece! Cece?

17:29.218 --> 17:30.820
- Cece!
- What's that about, man?

17:30.887 --> 17:32.588
I mean, I think the shirt's
pretty funny, no?

17:32.656 --> 17:34.156
- Not funny at all.
- Puns are creepy,

17:34.223 --> 17:35.891
- and they freak me out,
and you know that. - I like it.

17:35.959 --> 17:38.192
WOMEN: Nick!
- Oh, no, no, no.

17:38.260 --> 17:39.827
I hooked up with both
those girls last week.

17:39.895 --> 17:40.795
I didn't know they knew

17:40.863 --> 17:42.298
each other. I thought they just
lived in the same apartment.

17:42.366 --> 17:45.601
- Why didn't you call me? - Why didn't you
tell me you hooked up with my roommate?

17:45.669 --> 17:48.671
I don't...

17:50.238 --> 17:51.205
Willow, I didn't call you

17:51.273 --> 17:53.475
because I had
a family emergency.

17:53.942 --> 17:54.976
Is everything okay?

17:55.543 --> 17:56.711
Yes, it is.

17:56.779 --> 17:59.013
And Megan, I didn't tell you
about Willow because

17:59.081 --> 18:01.248
the moment we had was
so beautiful and intense,

18:01.816 --> 18:02.817
that for a second I thought

18:02.885 --> 18:04.853
we were the only people
on the planet.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.921
Oh. Okay.

18:07.989 --> 18:09.590
Well, we'll
see you later.

18:09.657 --> 18:11.191
- Bye.
NICK: Bye, guys.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.393
It worked.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.095
Where did that come from?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.063
I don't know.
I'm trembling, but it worked.

18:17.431 --> 18:19.967
That was so good
my pants just got tight, Nick.

18:20.034 --> 18:23.168
- Oh, God, now I hate me as much
as I've always hated you. - Skin.

18:23.235 --> 18:24.837
- See, I have to do this now.
- No, you don't. Don't do it.

18:24.905 --> 18:26.372
- Yes, I do.        - Skin.
- All you have to do is just not do it.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.607
I have to.
No, because it works.

18:31.733 --> 18:32.834
JESS:
Cece?

18:33.733 --> 18:37.234
Cece, I can't... breathe.

18:37.302 --> 18:40.705
Cece, I know why you didn't tell
me about Schmidt-- because

18:40.773 --> 18:42.240
you like him!

18:42.308 --> 18:43.375
What?!

18:43.442 --> 18:44.676
The shirt, Cece.

18:45.243 --> 18:47.245
You thought the shirt
he made was funny.

18:47.313 --> 18:49.814
You obviously like him.

18:49.882 --> 18:53.050
It's the only explanation
for thinking that's funny.

18:53.617 --> 18:55.286
Oh, my God,
I think you're right.

18:55.353 --> 18:56.853
And you didn't want to tell me

18:56.921 --> 18:58.388
'cause you knew
that I would know.

18:58.455 --> 19:00.290
And you weren't ready
to admit it to yourself.

19:00.357 --> 19:01.991
(panting)

19:02.059 --> 19:03.660
Okay, can we just say
that I didn't tell you

19:03.727 --> 19:05.361
because I'm a total bitch?

19:05.429 --> 19:07.997
'Cause I'm way more
comfortable with that.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.000
(softly):
Oh, maybe I like Schmidt.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.070
You... You can't
tell anyone.

19:14.137 --> 19:17.171
Yeah. That's like a secret
only I know.

19:17.439 --> 19:18.273
Heads up.

19:18.341 --> 19:19.641
I'm-I'm peeing.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.310
Oh, my God.

19:22.377 --> 19:23.745
Okay, come on.
We got to finish.

19:23.813 --> 19:25.647
(sobbing):
Oh! No!

19:25.715 --> 19:27.148
Oh, come on, man.
Come on, dude!

19:27.217 --> 19:29.318
(all chattering)

19:29.385 --> 19:31.952
Hey, here they come.
Here they come.

19:32.020 --> 19:34.054
Come on, guys!
Let's go!

19:34.122 --> 19:35.523
Come on, ladies!
Be strong!

19:35.591 --> 19:36.957
Come on!
Come on, ladies!

19:37.025 --> 19:38.593
- Come on, guys.
- All right, let's go!

19:38.660 --> 19:40.160
Come on...
Come on...

19:40.229 --> 19:42.563
- Finish strong!
NICK: Good job, guys.

19:42.631 --> 19:44.398
(grunting)

19:44.466 --> 19:46.199
NICK: Winner! Oh, man.

19:46.627 --> 19:47.633
Thanks for
waiting, man.

19:47.701 --> 19:48.801
Hey, thanks
for the ten bucks.

19:49.369 --> 19:50.870
JESS:
Guess what, you guys.

19:50.938 --> 19:53.606
- My shoes are filled with blood!
NICK: Oh, God.

19:53.673 --> 19:54.874
I think it's time to go home.
A little help. Come on.

19:54.942 --> 19:56.610
All right, Cece,
I got her, I got her.

19:56.677 --> 19:57.977
All right.
Okay, Jess, here we go.

19:58.045 --> 19:59.512
Okay, Schmidt,
grab her feet.

20:00.580 --> 20:01.381
- All right, there we go.
- Lead us away.

20:01.449 --> 20:02.881
Good job, Jess.

20:02.949 --> 20:04.450
(Jess laughs)
Real proud of you.

20:05.517 --> 20:06.618
What are you doing
to that basil, Cece?

20:06.685 --> 20:07.886
You trying to
make it confess?

20:07.954 --> 20:10.789
Easy with the knife,
Robespierre.

20:10.857 --> 20:12.457
I will cut off
your weaker fingers, Schmidt,

20:12.524 --> 20:14.425
and I'm gonna start
with your pinky.

20:14.493 --> 20:16.361
You guys are adorable.

20:16.428 --> 20:17.863
We are not
adorable.

20:17.930 --> 20:19.663
Okay? We are just
two people having

20:19.731 --> 20:21.832
casual, successful sex.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.267
My bad.

20:23.334 --> 20:24.702
(whispers):
Please.

20:24.770 --> 20:27.104
All right.
I can't stand this heat.

20:27.172 --> 20:28.939
I gonna get out
of the kitchen.

20:31.109 --> 20:32.644
Ow. Ow.

20:32.711 --> 20:34.444
You should really
stretch, Jess.

20:34.512 --> 20:35.512
Ow.

20:35.514 --> 20:38.848
You know, Jess thinking
that we're a cute couple is...

20:38.916 --> 20:41.351
I don't... It's
kind of a turnoff.

20:41.419 --> 20:44.053
How do we explain to her that
this is just... it's just sex?

20:44.121 --> 20:45.489
Mm-hmm.

20:46.556 --> 20:48.224
What is that?

20:48.293 --> 20:50.993
( Mumbles) That is shoddy
workmanship is what that is.

20:51.560 --> 20:51.994
I'm taking you
off prep.

20:52.061 --> 20:53.562
Go clean the
garbanzo beans.

20:53.630 --> 20:55.564
- I'm taking my knife.
- Be careful with that knife.

20:55.632 --> 20:57.065
It's from Japan.

20:59.202 --> 21:03.306
Why? Why, Cece?

21:03.373 --> 21:05.140
Why am I sleeping
with Schmidt?

21:05.208 --> 21:06.308
Is it a pity thing?

21:07.375 --> 21:08.876
Is he sick?

21:09.544 --> 21:10.779
Are you working
for the government?

21:10.846 --> 21:12.647
Damn it, he's holding you
against your will, isn't he?

21:12.715 --> 21:14.716
If he is holding you
against your will, blink twice.

21:16.251 --> 21:20.355
(blowing)
Blink twice.

21:20.423 --> 21:22.256
Are you tired
of being turned on?

21:22.324 --> 21:25.158
Hmm? You have a mole fetish?

21:30.197 --> 21:31.532
Is it huge?

21:32.299 --> 21:34.500
(clears throat)
I'm sorry. Let me rephrase that.

21:35.368 --> 21:36.370
Is it huge?
