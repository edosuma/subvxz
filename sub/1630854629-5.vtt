24:14.400 --> 24:17.120
We're releasing a statement
distancing ourselves from you.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.280
It's the only way
to avoid this getting out of control.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.280
I swear to you, I'm innocent.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.120
<i>Then what the fuck happened?</i>

24:23.640 --> 24:26.560
<i>I told you</i>
<i>to stay away from Adam Lawrence.</i>

24:27.360 --> 24:28.840
I was trying to save him.

24:29.360 --> 24:32.320
Angelis will be looking for me now.
I need an exit strategy.

24:32.400 --> 24:36.240
They'll kill me if they find me.
You know that.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.400
I can't help you, Kara.
Don't call this number again.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.400
<i>Wait!</i>

24:41.920 --> 24:44.160
I have something to trade.

24:44.240 --> 24:46.760
Maddy Lawrence thinks that
I killed her husband.

24:46.840 --> 24:48.840
She's on a crusade
to try and clear his name.

24:49.440 --> 24:52.080
She's got hold of a stash
of Angelis' kompromat.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.560
What's she planning to do?

24:58.400 --> 25:03.400
She stole a silver Volvo.
Registration G28 1XPL.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.080
<i>I need more than that.</i>

25:05.160 --> 25:07.680
Look, take it or leave it.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.120
But I wouldnâ€™t want to be you

25:10.200 --> 25:14.600
when the Kremlin finds out
you missed a secret stash of MI6 intel

25:15.200 --> 25:17.760
on every head of state in the world.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.400
I'll make a call.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.360
See if it's worth a ticket home.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.320
I lost the files.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.760
But at least they've done us some good.

34:44.240 --> 34:47.480
Angelis is finished.
And Maddy Lawrence can't prove anything.

34:47.560 --> 34:50.440
She hasn't got
a single piece of evidence against me.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.680
The situation is salvageable.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.720
Yes.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.320
Goodbye.
