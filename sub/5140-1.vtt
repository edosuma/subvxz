00:40.470 --> 00:42.500
Hello. My name is O Song Gyeong.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.960
I'm 28 years old.

00:44.270 --> 00:45.560
I work at the bank.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.640
I am Gang Dong Ju.
I'm 34 years old.

00:48.780 --> 00:51.880
Now working at sports academy.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.020
Mainly

00:54.070 --> 00:57.990
supervising the kids,
teaching them stuff like taekwondo,

00:58.010 --> 01:00.930
and managing their daily lives.

01:00.990 --> 01:02.820
I have a habit of winning.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.230
My motto is "people who are prepared
are more likely to be victorious".

01:06.560 --> 01:07.790
Personal strength is information gathering.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.230
I like to ride on a motorcycle.
It seems like girls don't dig this.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.480
I enjoy tea and movies.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.000
I also like to read.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.210
Can you smile a little?

01:22.510 --> 01:24.330
Aigoo... funny as hell!

01:24.330 --> 01:27.920
It is said recently that even those who work
for a large enterprise will have to retire
once they're over the age of 40.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.380
That is what's rumored.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.020
Steadily arrange life's projects.

01:32.020 --> 01:35.430
I want to find someone who is like me.
Someone who shares the same vision.

01:39.020 --> 01:41.330
The type that I like?

01:41.960 --> 01:44.460
My type is...

01:44.630 --> 01:46.130
women who look good in uniform.

02:48.190 --> 02:49.860
The needle hasn't even gone in yet!

03:18.000 --> 03:25.370
-=Never Ending Story=-

03:28.370 --> 03:30.870
An eminent person to the southeast...

03:37.340 --> 03:39.560
Born in the year 1979.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.350
What are you doing over there?
It's time to eat!

03:42.630 --> 03:44.010
I will.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.750
By the way, do you plan to not address
your husband's elder brother respectfully?

03:49.560 --> 03:52.560
People who don't know us will think
that our family is rude.

03:55.020 --> 03:56.700
Ajubonim.
(Brother-in-law)

03:56.870 --> 03:57.900
That's the right way.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.200
Everything went well yesterday?

04:00.370 --> 04:01.370
Yeah.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.870
In order to help you get married,
I have racked my brain.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.510
Please be on your best behavior
when you go for the blind date.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.540
Someone won a jackpot again.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.050
2.7 billion.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.380
When is it going to be my turn?

04:21.350 --> 04:22.860
Hyeong, you want me to get you some rice?

04:32.360 --> 04:33.700
That punk!

04:41.710 --> 04:45.880
That won't do. I just checked
and it has an issue with hygiene.

04:46.710 --> 04:49.240
The payment due date is almost up.
Don't forget!

04:50.750 --> 04:52.840
- Welcome
- Please sit.

04:58.260 --> 05:01.070
The amount that you owe is way too high.
There's nothing we can do.

05:01.430 --> 05:04.560
On the 17th of next month, you shouldn't
have any problem adapting to the revision
of the schedule.

05:06.070 --> 05:08.200
Just because of that money that I owe,

05:08.630 --> 05:10.970
you people try to charge more in interest?

05:11.440 --> 05:13.940
I'm sorry, there's not much we can do.

05:16.110 --> 05:21.910
You...

05:22.750 --> 05:24.420
Does that look like a sorry face?

05:35.760 --> 05:36.930
Don't mind me!

05:42.770 --> 05:44.100
-=Assistant Manager O Song Gyeong=-

05:44.440 --> 05:45.940
Miss O Song Gyeong.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.440
You look like you'll get married soon.

05:48.770 --> 05:51.940
You can't jinx the upcoming happy event
by doing something like this.

05:53.110 --> 05:55.910
No, I was only helping a friend
with her wedding preparations.

05:56.550 --> 05:59.720
Oh, a friend is getting married?

06:00.050 --> 06:02.720
So, you're in a bad mood because of
your inability to get married?

06:02.890 --> 06:04.720
I can understand that kind of feeling.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.430
You're not getting any younger,

06:07.730 --> 06:11.630
and you're worrying that you'll die lonely.

06:12.130 --> 06:15.130
I can understand that kind of feeling.

06:17.770 --> 06:20.740
No, I'm also going to get married.
Next year.

06:21.410 --> 06:24.410
The year after, I will receive an apartment
in the new Bok-dong Development Zone.

06:24.910 --> 06:27.910
As for kids, I plan to have a boy and a girl
after two years of marriage.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.920
If in-laws are in the picture,
we will move out after I turn 40 years old.

06:31.420 --> 06:33.590
After 8 years,
the education fund for the kids

06:33.750 --> 06:35.390
until college will absolutely not be a problem.

06:38.890 --> 06:42.230
Aigoo, you are not married, sir?

06:44.730 --> 06:46.090
Lean over...

07:03.250 --> 07:07.700
1, 2, 3, 4.

07:07.940 --> 07:09.430
1, 2.

07:11.780 --> 07:13.200
You've worked hard.

07:15.030 --> 07:16.700
Focus... focus.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.970
An eminent person to the southeast...

07:29.310 --> 07:31.450
Tae Min, come over here!

07:33.570 --> 07:35.800
You've worked hard.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.900
Goodbye.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.090
Our Tae Min will do a good job, right?

07:45.220 --> 07:46.720
One by one...

07:49.500 --> 07:52.000
Good. One more.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.340
Aigoo! Our Tae Min's luck is really unusual.

08:02.420 --> 08:04.040
One more.

08:13.150 --> 08:13.990
Aish...

08:15.820 --> 08:17.290
What are you doing?

08:19.090 --> 08:21.430
Things were going great.
Such a disappointment.

08:21.930 --> 08:23.430
Can't I have an interest?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.930
- Make sure you clean.
- You nag all day long.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
That punk!

08:37.840 --> 08:39.780
That's impossible.

08:40.110 --> 08:44.320
<i>It is very normal to be in a denial
in the beginning of such a situation.</i>

08:44.620 --> 08:47.290
Yes. But what I am telling you now is,

08:47.790 --> 08:52.320
however bad it may sound,
you just have to learn to accept the reality
and stabilize your mood.

08:53.330 --> 08:55.960
That way, the progression of the disease
can be slowed down.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.700
<i>Of course it will be very painful.</i>

08:59.200 --> 09:02.370
I am also having a string of such patients.
What a headache.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.340
How come today's patients
are such a headache?

09:09.010 --> 09:12.680
If these results are true,
how long do I have?

09:13.010 --> 09:16.650
3 months to 6 months at most.

09:17.180 --> 09:18.520
If it's very long...

09:19.890 --> 09:20.830
Mr. Gang Dong Ju?

09:22.220 --> 09:24.410
It doesn't make any sense.

09:24.440 --> 09:28.030
Mr. Gang Dong Ju,
I have already told you...

09:28.030 --> 09:29.720
There's nothing to be apprehensive about.

09:29.860 --> 09:33.200
This is really ridiculous!
Look at that head,
it's way too small to be my head.

09:33.330 --> 09:35.880
This is not yours.
Could you leave?

09:36.340 --> 09:39.980
How can it happen out of the blue?
A tumor is a tumor,
why does it have to be malignant?

09:40.010 --> 09:42.290
- You go out first.
- Have a look one more time.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.740
- We can't do that.
- Why not? Why?

09:44.880 --> 09:48.350
Just examine me one more time!
Let go of me!

09:49.240 --> 09:52.960
- Mr. Dong Ju. Mr. Dong Ju.
- Please get up!

09:52.990 --> 09:55.450
Didn't you say you would re-examine it?

09:56.040 --> 09:59.450
Do it one more time to confirm it, okay?

10:00.210 --> 10:02.690
I want to redo it.
Please arrange the appointment for me.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.450
<i>The health inspection for the kindergarten
is done quite often, right?</i>

10:10.670 --> 10:13.680
<i>I saw on the news they said a lot of
E. Coli bacteria is found on the playground.</i>

10:15.350 --> 10:18.680
<i>Please add me to the waiting list.</i>

10:20.690 --> 10:24.320
No, it's a girl.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.190
4 years old.

10:28.790 --> 10:29.510
Yes.

10:33.970 --> 10:36.770
You have a kid?

10:36.820 --> 10:40.770
No. It was my customers
who wanted me to ask.

10:42.690 --> 10:45.980
By the way, which bus are you taking?

10:46.660 --> 10:48.400
I drove here.

10:49.580 --> 10:51.320
Then what are you doing here?

10:52.990 --> 10:56.760
I was just walking around.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.520
Are you following me by any chance?

10:59.630 --> 11:01.460
No. That's not it.

11:02.290 --> 11:06.430
I understand.
It's an instinct to be attracted to pretty girls.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.400
Are you suffering from 'princess syndrome'?

11:10.540 --> 11:11.700
It's a brain tumor.

11:30.990 --> 11:36.910
~ <i>Congratulations to you.
Congratulations to you.</i> ~

11:37.000 --> 11:42.540
~ <i>Wishing you happy birthday.
Song Gyeong! Song Gyeong!
Congratulations to you.</i> ~

11:42.670 --> 11:47.310
~ <i>Congratulations to you.
Wishing you a happy birthday.</i> ~

11:47.340 --> 11:48.640
Tada!

11:50.250 --> 11:52.780
You see, I told you.

11:52.950 --> 11:54.730
This girl does not like surprises.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.120
Honey, how about letting her
check out the gift now?

11:57.480 --> 11:59.620
Guys, let's eat!

12:06.330 --> 12:08.170
How is it? How is it?

12:11.170 --> 12:14.960
We can tell that you like it,
but did we overdo it a little?

12:15.170 --> 12:18.180
Are you crazy?
How long would it take me
to use up everything?

12:18.340 --> 12:20.680
Come on, Song Gyeong.
Blow out the candles!

12:28.990 --> 12:31.790
Hey, if I die, what will you do?

12:32.930 --> 12:36.900
I will turn your room into a study.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.230
Jesu?
(Younger brother's wife or sister-in-law)

12:42.230 --> 12:43.900
I want a cloakroom.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.590
You only have this much clothing and you
want to renovate the whole room into a closet?

12:48.710 --> 12:51.040
How many books do you have, then?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.550
I'll buy more.
I'll buy them!

12:52.710 --> 12:56.220
You don't even like to read.
Why buy books? It's better to buy clothes.

12:56.380 --> 13:00.480
Clothes my foot!
We better invest in something
like literature.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.060
Are you tired of living?
Hand me those flowers!

13:03.720 --> 13:05.730
Don't touch my plants!

13:09.360 --> 13:11.830
The result is still same as the last time?

13:13.830 --> 13:16.700
Prepare for the chemo.

13:17.450 --> 13:19.190
Chemo will make my hair...

13:20.140 --> 13:23.480
Can I keep on living if
I lose all of my hair?

13:28.350 --> 13:33.980
That... your hair won't
fall out completely.

13:34.950 --> 13:37.460
Besides, nowadays there are
many beautiful wigs.

13:39.590 --> 13:42.720
What's my chance of survival?

13:43.130 --> 13:46.040
Well, next time when you come again,
please bring a family member.

13:49.170 --> 13:51.940
I'll be dead in 3 months, right?

13:53.610 --> 13:56.110
Just arrange it according to the schedule.

14:00.450 --> 14:02.780
Let's decide it now!

14:02.950 --> 14:05.280
So, we'll use this as a benchmark to plan.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.590
May I use this?

14:16.400 --> 14:18.900
<i>Chance of rain: 51%</i>

14:19.570 --> 14:21.570
<i>Probability does not lie.</i>

14:57.340 --> 14:59.210
I'm home!

15:29.740 --> 15:31.740
Nothing happened the whole night?

15:32.280 --> 15:33.970
You didn't feel cold, did you?

15:36.240 --> 15:40.010
Pyo Nan, don't drink, okay?

15:40.050 --> 15:41.550
Or you'll end up like my hyeong.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.890
Why aren't you answering your phone?

15:54.060 --> 15:56.560
I'm talking to you.

15:59.370 --> 16:01.500
Do you want to die?

16:02.990 --> 16:03.960
No.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.010
Hello?

16:12.200 --> 16:14.160
Where?

16:16.140 --> 16:17.180
What?

16:19.340 --> 16:23.820
Look at those two!
They must have had a lot to drink.

16:24.980 --> 16:27.290
Ajussi...

16:30.890 --> 16:32.220
It's really refreshng.
Please have a drink!

16:32.390 --> 16:35.730
This is really not so bad.
Only a minor problem.

16:45.570 --> 16:49.070
Why couldn't you just stay
in your room after drinking?
Did you really have to wander out again?

16:52.240 --> 16:54.580
Why did you grab a stranger's hands?

16:56.050 --> 16:57.550
Do you feel lonely lately?

17:04.560 --> 17:06.260
I went to the hospital yesterday.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.430
Aren't you going to ask me why?

17:15.599 --> 17:17.770
- You take care of the check yourself!
- There he goes again.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.109
Even if I won a jackpot,
I wouldn't give them a single penny.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.839
I'm going to spend it all before I die.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.020
Hey!

17:37.990 --> 17:40.030
So, that means...

17:40.360 --> 17:42.030
I won't get my money back, is that right?

17:42.530 --> 17:46.170
Our staff has spent a lot of
time and effort for your sake.

17:46.470 --> 17:49.050
It's you who changed your mind.

17:49.940 --> 17:52.100
We have picked out a quite
decent member for you.

17:52.270 --> 17:53.660
Why don't you meet him
and then we'll talk.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.610
I already told you, there is no need
for me to get married anymore.

17:55.740 --> 17:59.080
Why don't you take a look at the agreement.
The problem isn't on our side.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.420
Look!

18:05.750 --> 18:09.720
A member has the right to terminate
the contract within a period of time.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.220
Therefore...

18:13.790 --> 18:16.960
Call the manager!
Call the manager!

18:18.130 --> 18:20.570
Tell the manager to come out!

18:26.150 --> 18:27.260
I want my money back!

18:28.190 --> 18:30.510
- Follow me.
- Get lost.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.050
Thank you.

18:39.420 --> 18:41.290
But how come you know so much
about stuff like this?

18:42.490 --> 18:45.290
I did some research on
how to get a refund.

18:46.630 --> 18:48.250
You drove here?

18:48.510 --> 18:49.370
Yeah.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.520
Are you following me again?

18:53.520 --> 18:54.600
Huh?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.020
Really, I'm not.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.470
Let's go get some soju.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.790
Three months...

19:15.450 --> 19:18.120
Three months is too short.

19:18.260 --> 19:19.370
I know, right?

19:19.790 --> 19:22.800
Yes, 3 months is too short.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.570
I can't just die like this.

19:29.570 --> 19:34.410
I am trying my hardest to live on.

19:35.570 --> 19:40.050
If only I had known...

19:42.050 --> 19:47.550
As for me...
I owe my brother and his wife too much
and need to pay them back.

19:48.350 --> 19:50.360
But I have no savings at all.

19:50.860 --> 19:55.180
Up until now, I don't have any
beautiful memories or anything.

19:55.430 --> 19:57.400
I haven't even gotten married yet.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.770
The more I talk about it,
the more I feel it's not fair.

20:12.440 --> 20:16.080
Let's rob a bank together.

20:17.750 --> 20:23.060
Incurable illness...
Rob a bank, a walk on the beach...
those are all things you see in the movies.

20:23.220 --> 20:25.060
Where are you going get the gun from?

20:25.390 --> 20:28.060
You know how difficult it is to
get a gun in our country, right?

20:28.390 --> 20:31.200
Don't you know there are 15 CCTVs?
What about the security system then?

20:33.000 --> 20:35.530
How come you know all about this?

20:36.300 --> 20:37.670
I work at the bank.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.740
Where?

21:03.030 --> 21:06.770
What is the opposite of mountain bunny?
<i>("Mountain" sounds the same as "acid" in Korean.)</i>

21:09.310 --> 21:11.280
- Household bunny?
- Wrong!

21:12.450 --> 21:14.780
- Sea bunny?
- Wrong.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.750
- Wild bunny?
- Wrong.

21:17.080 --> 21:20.590
A wild baby bunny, right?

21:24.420 --> 21:26.260
It's alkaline bunny!

21:30.060 --> 21:33.220
- You have time this coming Saturday?
- Huh?

21:33.230 --> 21:35.400
I am asking you whether
you have time this coming Saturday.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.900
I have nothing special to do.

21:39.070 --> 21:42.580
If you have time this Saturday,
would you mind to accompanying me
to Chong Pyeong?

21:42.740 --> 21:47.050
I heard they have a nice crematorium
and I want to take a look with you.

21:50.750 --> 21:53.300
You don't plan to be cremated?

21:54.050 --> 21:56.550
I don't think they have any empty
spots left in the public cemetery.

21:58.220 --> 21:59.890
Public cemetery?

22:01.050 --> 22:03.320
Don't you think it'd be wise
to plan ahead?

22:04.120 --> 22:07.630
Anyway, I have time this Saturday.
Will you go with me?

22:08.460 --> 22:10.300
Just think of it as a date.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.930
A date?

22:14.800 --> 22:18.400
About that, I think I can make it.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.670
But I seem to have a prior engagement.

22:22.010 --> 22:24.010
Who is testing whom now?

22:24.510 --> 22:25.840
Fine, if you don't want to.

22:33.490 --> 22:34.490
Taxi!

22:35.490 --> 22:37.990
Aigoo. What's wrong?
I didn't say I wouldn't.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.020
Call me tomorrow!

22:44.000 --> 22:46.100
- I'm leaving.
- Be careful.

22:52.300 --> 22:53.760
Aigoo, phone number...

23:03.800 --> 23:05.270
Welcome!

23:22.110 --> 23:24.190
- You go first!
- Thank you.

23:35.950 --> 23:38.070
<i>Have a nice day, Ma'am.</i>

23:39.830 --> 23:41.750
Customer number 39.

23:45.140 --> 23:46.850
You never gave me your phone number.

23:46.970 --> 23:49.950
- Why didn't you ask?
- Huh?

23:50.560 --> 23:55.070
You brought it up first, so you should
have been the one who told me.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.540
That would be weird.
A pretty girl gives out her number
without being asked?

24:00.170 --> 24:04.480
I, too, want to experience what it feels like
when a man persistently asks for my number.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.310
- Me?
- Yes, do it once! Like striking up
a conversation or something.

24:07.810 --> 24:10.350
Striking up a conversation is not exciting.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.450
Of course excitement is necessary.
Girls like that kind of stuff.

24:13.490 --> 24:14.930
Isn't it a bit embarrassing to do?

24:14.930 --> 24:16.390
Can't you do it just once?

24:16.430 --> 24:18.100
Hurry and tell me!
Time is running out.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.000
I don't have much time either.

24:20.030 --> 24:22.990
Forget it then.
What a pity!

24:25.330 --> 24:27.020
Customer number 40.

24:30.980 --> 24:33.000
- Hey! How can you cut in like that?

24:43.660 --> 24:45.750
You people have a really lousy way
of dealing with customers here.

24:45.790 --> 24:47.710
Shouldn't you pay more attention to me?

25:03.640 --> 25:08.310
Is this one better or this one?
I'm going to meet Beom Su's parents'
this weekend.

25:08.650 --> 25:10.010
Let me take a look.

25:14.120 --> 25:18.820
Of course the pink one is better.
Compared to black, pink looks brighter.

25:19.130 --> 25:22.580
Pretty. When are you going to wear those?

25:22.630 --> 25:25.770
Ah, one of these days.

25:25.870 --> 25:29.670
You don't even have a boyfriend and yet
you brought yourself wedding shoes?

25:29.670 --> 25:31.500
You are indeed O Song Gyeong.

25:47.350 --> 25:49.160
It doesn't look like a uniform.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.330
I like uniforms.

26:03.670 --> 26:05.000
Which way?

26:07.910 --> 26:12.420
The position and location of our
would-be grave is the best of the best
according to feng-shui.

26:13.180 --> 26:16.070
This is the urns' display room.

26:22.620 --> 26:24.260
How much is this?

26:24.290 --> 26:26.260
This is our best seller.

26:26.290 --> 26:28.200
769 000 Won.

26:28.290 --> 26:30.300
Why is it so expensive?

26:30.600 --> 26:33.200
Because it's hand-carved, sir.

26:33.270 --> 26:35.800
Don't you have anything with
a decorative pattern on it?

26:36.240 --> 26:38.000
This one?

26:39.840 --> 26:43.520
This one is Rasputin.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.220
What do you think?

26:49.820 --> 26:51.270
Let me see this one!

27:17.170 --> 27:19.670
Slow down if you have any conscience.

27:19.810 --> 27:21.970
I heard that people who die from eating
have it best.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.480
Are you the only one who's going to die?
I am too.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.880
It's already unfair that I'm going to die.
I have to suffer too?

27:29.380 --> 27:30.880
Fine, eat then!

27:31.220 --> 27:32.380
I'm full.

27:34.050 --> 27:36.860
By the way, why are we using banmal?
(banmal  -  informal Korean)

27:37.190 --> 27:40.530
Although we're going to die soon,
still we need to keep our good manners.

27:41.690 --> 27:44.200
Since you brought this up,
let's see who is older.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.830
I am 33 years old.
What about you?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.840
You busy next week, oppa?

27:54.670 --> 27:57.510
Why? You want to go and look
at the graveyard?

27:59.010 --> 28:00.010
Grave...

28:01.650 --> 28:03.150
How did you know?

28:03.820 --> 28:05.150
Really, you are...

28:05.320 --> 28:07.820
Why do you have to live like that?

28:07.990 --> 28:10.160
In case it ends up like that,

28:10.160 --> 28:12.320
people will help us with the arrangements.

28:12.990 --> 28:15.960
Shouldn't I plan for my own funeral?

28:16.230 --> 28:18.060
Just like I plan my own wedding.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.870
How can a wedding and funeral be the same?

28:19.870 --> 28:22.700
I am the lead actress in both of them.
So, they're the same.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.840
You clearly know that you're
not acting normal, right?

28:26.170 --> 28:28.010
That's how I am.

28:28.170 --> 28:30.010
If you don't do anything,
who will help you?

28:30.340 --> 28:32.810
I'll do my own things.

28:33.280 --> 28:37.660
I plan things to do for today and tomorrow.
Then I'll do it according to the schedule.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.750
That's my lifestyle.

28:40.590 --> 28:43.260
You have quite a tiring life.

28:43.420 --> 28:45.130
Helping each other to get through the day,
isn't that nice?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.430
Besides, how can life develop as planned?

28:47.890 --> 28:50.400
If you're so stubborn,
why did you go to the hospital then?

28:50.560 --> 28:54.900
Use your own UV radiation treatment
at your own home, treat yourself,
wouldn't that great?

28:56.740 --> 28:58.300
- Oh, shit!
- You scared me!

28:59.340 --> 29:00.600
I should go now.

29:01.110 --> 29:01.940
Why?

29:03.940 --> 29:04.940
Where are you going?

29:09.720 --> 29:12.890
You ran like that to buy just this?

29:13.220 --> 29:16.290
What? What do you mean by "just this?"
This is very important to me, you know.

29:16.460 --> 29:18.290
Number 37.
Phone number 37.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.970
=It's now the drawing time.=

29:33.140 --> 29:35.970
Jump! Is it really that hard?

29:36.310 --> 29:38.980
=The first ball is...
Number 26 red.=

29:39.140 --> 29:42.310
What's "squat with both arms opened
and take a deep breath" in English?

29:42.650 --> 29:45.980
You should learn if you don't know.
How can you live with that spirit?

29:46.320 --> 29:48.290
You don't know what taekwondo
is in English?

29:48.620 --> 29:51.790
I heard Team Leader Lee
taught taekwondo in English.

29:52.930 --> 29:58.430
Go teach it yourself if you're dying for it.
Isn't ballet in English already?
"Arabesque something."

29:58.460 --> 29:59.930
Ah, really.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.970
Is that English? Is it?

30:02.300 --> 30:03.300
What's that?

30:05.140 --> 30:06.310
Geesh...

30:06.470 --> 30:08.640
Why don't you do some reading?

30:10.810 --> 30:12.480
It hurts, it hurts.

30:12.980 --> 30:14.280
Not even once.

30:15.450 --> 30:18.280
- How is it?
- Does your little finger hurt?

30:18.620 --> 30:19.990
Haven't you two fought enough?

30:22.820 --> 30:24.320
That's enough.

30:27.490 --> 30:30.160
Do you know what the opposite
of mountain (acid) bunny is?

30:32.530 --> 30:37.400
Don't tell me it's... alkaline bunny?

30:57.760 --> 30:59.090
Scared me to death!

30:59.430 --> 31:00.730
Why did you turn off the light?

31:01.570 --> 31:02.690
What?

31:03.390 --> 31:05.460
I want to sleep here.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.660
Oppa...

31:09.660 --> 31:11.760
You called because you're worried?

31:12.080 --> 31:14.250
No, we're together.

31:14.870 --> 31:17.650
Being together with that brat
scares me even more.

31:37.340 --> 31:38.360
Hello?

31:38.650 --> 31:40.670
=Aren't you going to call and ask
whether or not I am scared?=

31:40.740 --> 31:41.910
What?

31:42.410 --> 31:45.020
Isn't there a thunderstorm?

31:46.280 --> 31:48.000
How scared can you be?

31:48.010 --> 31:49.610
What's with your voice?

31:52.020 --> 31:53.340
Did you cry?

31:54.520 --> 31:57.820
No, I'm not fully awake yet, that's why.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.870
I'll send you a map.
Rush over here within 20 minutes.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.130
What?

32:10.140 --> 32:13.470
<i>What time is it already?
This will be the last time.</i>

32:13.970 --> 32:15.610
- I know.
- Mi Yeong...

32:15.940 --> 32:17.280
why haven't you introduced
her to me yet?

32:17.440 --> 32:19.780
I know, I know.
I will introduce her to you.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.040
Why keep touching it if
he doesn't plan to buy it?

32:26.290 --> 32:28.310
That's a limited edition item.

32:32.590 --> 32:34.930
Your romance line has increased
with 3 more lines.

32:35.390 --> 32:38.900
The first man was a short-lived first love.

32:39.570 --> 32:42.370
The second one has passed already.

32:42.670 --> 32:45.340
You'll meet the man you're
destined to be with this year.

32:45.670 --> 32:48.240
Liar! What do you mean, destined?

32:48.310 --> 32:52.990
Lately people say I've become like
a holy man and want me to ask God.

32:53.310 --> 32:56.880
You know Eun Ji Won right?
You should know Eun Ji Won well.

32:56.980 --> 32:59.690
That Eun Ji Won couple got married
because of my prediction too.

32:59.820 --> 33:01.490
Let me see your hand.

33:03.160 --> 33:07.330
We'll find whether or not you two are
fit for each other using this method.

33:07.630 --> 33:09.130
Let me take a look.

33:09.630 --> 33:12.800
You are of the philosophical type.

33:13.130 --> 33:17.390
The philosophical type abound in sensitivity,
dying from hanging themselves from trees.

33:17.640 --> 33:18.970
Seriously?

33:19.940 --> 33:21.870
You are of the defensive type.

33:21.940 --> 33:25.130
The defensive type focuses on reality.
They have a strong drive.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.780
Water and wood.

33:28.450 --> 33:31.450
You two are simply inseparable.

33:31.780 --> 33:34.510
It is fate.
A magnet.

33:34.550 --> 33:36.750
Red and blue.

33:36.860 --> 33:39.190
What about my life line?

33:39.360 --> 33:42.010
I am not really good at
predicting from life lines.

33:43.860 --> 33:46.990
Long... long...
You two will be together
for a very long time.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.340
You'll live for a long time,
like people who live up on a mountain.

33:50.470 --> 33:52.440
Just make yourselves at home, okay?

33:52.470 --> 33:56.640
The fortune telling fee and the popcorn
together is 32 500 Won.

33:57.310 --> 33:59.810
Mi Yeong...

34:00.550 --> 34:02.550
That's right! Mi Yeong.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.630
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

34:07.820 --> 34:09.120
Mi Yeong...

34:09.889 --> 34:13.060
If you were born as a fish,
what kind of fish you would want to be?

34:13.219 --> 34:16.780
A tortoise.
A tortoise has a very long lifespan.

34:16.900 --> 34:19.040
I want to be able to live
until I'm 100 years old too.

34:22.600 --> 34:25.130
Also, don't cry anymore.

34:25.940 --> 34:28.280
Crying alone is very embarrassing.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.050
What?

34:33.510 --> 34:35.989
You cried because of those lotto tickets?

34:36.020 --> 34:38.250
But that's ridiculous.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.250
This time it should have won.

34:40.420 --> 34:42.420
It must hit the jackpot.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.000
How come there was
not even one that hit?

34:46.130 --> 34:48.920
The happiness of a person's lifetime
is made in heaven.

34:48.929 --> 34:50.060
Isn't there is a saying?

34:50.100 --> 34:52.409
"In youth, suffer.
In old age, be fortunate."

34:52.429 --> 34:54.340
If you don't suffer when you're young,

34:54.429 --> 34:56.300
you'll suffer when you're old.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.540
That is the truth.

34:59.210 --> 35:02.030
Think about it!
We don't have much time left.

35:02.140 --> 35:04.310
So, how about the luck
that we haven't used?

35:04.640 --> 35:07.030
The remaining luck... is now.

35:07.310 --> 35:10.480
Let's add it together and use it all up!

35:10.820 --> 35:13.620
If it's not a paycheck,
how is it possible to save it?

35:13.650 --> 35:16.480
According to probability calculations,
now would be the most appropriate time.

35:16.620 --> 35:17.880
Baloney!

35:17.960 --> 35:21.240
Look at you!
Don't you watch TV? Endorphin!

35:21.960 --> 35:25.470
The amount of endorphin that can be
secreted in a lifetime is only
as big as half of your thumb.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.860
But the amount used while you're still
alive is not even one-fourth of that.

35:28.970 --> 35:30.970
So when does the rest come out?

35:32.490 --> 35:33.990
On your deathbed.

35:34.270 --> 35:36.000
What's that got to do with lotto tickets?

35:36.020 --> 35:38.440
Think about it!
Of course it has something to do with it.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.840
When is the time when our brain
produce the most endorphin?

35:41.790 --> 35:45.590
It's when we strike a lottery jackpot!

35:57.220 --> 36:00.390
I will apply for a leave of absence soon.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.330
No matter what, it needs to be official.

36:05.310 --> 36:07.330
You will run with me, right?

36:08.370 --> 36:10.830
Both of us holding hands together,
preparing to die?

36:11.510 --> 36:14.040
That too.

36:15.380 --> 36:18.710
You know right, that I am very
good at checking on things.

36:19.080 --> 36:22.410
I have found out a place where
it's easier to hit a lotto jackpot.

36:22.710 --> 36:24.540
Great! That's not bad!

36:25.570 --> 36:27.510
It looks like I will hit it big soon.

36:27.940 --> 36:31.350
I didn't want to tell you actually,
but do you know what bad luck I have?

36:31.710 --> 36:34.350
For example, has a bird
ever crapped on you?

36:34.360 --> 36:35.630
I think not.

36:36.020 --> 36:39.470
Other people managed to avoid that,
but me, I have experienced that
at least 17 times.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.140
One time I was looking up the sky
and a bird shitted in my mouth.

36:42.140 --> 36:43.740
My mouth was stinking of bird poop.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.610
All of my friends fled.

36:47.170 --> 36:48.120
Hello?

36:50.710 --> 36:52.180
You fell asleep? Hello?

36:52.180 --> 36:53.510
Hello?

37:41.040 --> 37:42.710
Why is he like this all of the sudden?

37:43.500 --> 37:44.480
You...

37:46.340 --> 37:48.410
Are you hiding something from me?

37:48.440 --> 37:49.570
No.

37:58.470 --> 38:00.030
I want to take a leave.

38:04.490 --> 38:06.170
Bye.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.200
The food needs to be delicious.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.010
Is it delicious?

39:00.510 --> 39:01.950
Not too bad.

39:07.350 --> 39:09.900
What are they so happy about?
Laughing like that.

39:09.990 --> 39:12.170
How sad the deceased would feel.

39:12.630 --> 39:14.250
That's why they laugh.

39:14.570 --> 39:15.440
Why?

39:15.560 --> 39:20.210
It means the deceased need not worry,
because the people he left behind are doing great.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.180
Number 1, checked.

39:27.170 --> 39:31.680
I don't get how you can be like this
during such a precious time.

39:33.180 --> 39:35.140
Let's go if you're done.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.620
Where is the place?

39:54.830 --> 39:56.270
Hurry up!

40:04.280 --> 40:07.030
What's the use of us doing such things?

40:07.080 --> 40:09.820
This kid, why do you remember such words?

40:09.880 --> 40:13.010
Look at you!
Sorry, sorry!

40:13.070 --> 40:14.510
Where to?

40:14.720 --> 40:16.670
Hey... Hey...

40:17.220 --> 40:18.370
You see...

40:20.200 --> 40:21.300
Where?

40:25.030 --> 40:27.400
It's at the top.
You see that?

40:27.770 --> 40:30.600
Why is the lotto place
located so high up?

40:31.270 --> 40:33.350
Doesn't make any sense at all.

40:34.610 --> 40:37.040
Nothing is free.
Hurry and go up there!

40:37.040 --> 40:38.940
By myself?

40:41.210 --> 40:43.250
Were you ever an outcast
when you were in school?

40:43.380 --> 40:46.990
Nope. Kids who are smart and
good-looking are not outcasts.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.460
What a nuisance.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.050
We came here together,
so we also go up together.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.010
<i>Broken steps.</i>

41:56.120 --> 41:59.790
This shroud is made of gold.

41:59.810 --> 42:01.710
Although the price is a little bit high,

42:01.730 --> 42:03.830
isn't it said that if you wear a gold shroud

42:03.900 --> 42:05.960
you will go to heaven?

42:10.170 --> 42:14.010
Well, actually it's not necessary
to buy an expensive one.

42:14.170 --> 42:17.350
Just prepare accordingly.

42:17.510 --> 42:21.050
This is a top-notch Andong robe.

42:21.050 --> 42:22.860
This one is not bad.

42:23.020 --> 42:29.000
People care about this stuff when they're
alive, but once you're dead who cares?

42:32.160 --> 42:33.620
May I try it on?

42:33.830 --> 42:34.830
What?

42:36.660 --> 42:39.630
Miss, you really are funny.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.670
It's for me.

42:41.930 --> 42:43.030
What?

42:48.110 --> 42:49.590
Come on! Come on!

42:49.780 --> 42:51.120
What?

42:51.240 --> 42:53.570
How could there be such a person?

42:53.750 --> 42:55.690
Let go!
What are you doing?

42:56.920 --> 42:58.960
Are you crazy?

42:59.090 --> 43:00.470
"It's for me."

43:00.590 --> 43:01.590
That's really...

43:01.750 --> 43:03.030
You're still in the mood to worry
about other people?

43:03.090 --> 43:04.870
Did you see that ajumma's expression?

43:04.920 --> 43:07.290
If she got spooked and the baby came out,
would you be responsible for that?

43:07.390 --> 43:09.060
Go somewhere else!

43:12.230 --> 43:14.550
I want to pick one that looks good.

43:14.730 --> 43:15.600
Then,

43:58.080 --> 43:59.130
I'm leaving.

44:07.690 --> 44:08.690
Song Gyeong!

44:09.020 --> 44:11.050
Are you guys just coming in now?

44:12.490 --> 44:13.990
Do they like Jin Ju?

44:14.130 --> 44:15.630
Very much so.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.460
Song Gyeong, how come you've
lost so much weight?

44:17.960 --> 44:21.270
Because I have to worry about
Jin Ju's meals everyday.

44:21.430 --> 44:23.770
I knew it. You must have done
the grocery shopping.

46:48.450 --> 46:52.020
How on earth did I end up with two sons?

46:52.450 --> 46:54.790
Mother-in-law is also...

46:56.960 --> 47:01.000
Hey, are you suffering
from alcohol poisoning?

47:02.130 --> 47:04.970
Also, you came home
in the middle of the night?
And what are these?

47:05.300 --> 47:08.510
I bought these lotto tickets from the
store that has the highest hit rate.

47:08.770 --> 47:12.960
Hold onto these!
This is the only thing I can do for you guys.

47:13.270 --> 47:17.000
The only thing you can do for me is
not buying these lotto tickets,

47:17.180 --> 47:20.530
it's moving out of here as soon as possible.

47:20.650 --> 47:22.070
You got that, brother-in-law?

47:22.110 --> 47:23.620
I told you to keep them!

47:25.580 --> 47:27.930
These are the winning tickets.

47:32.220 --> 47:35.330
Hey, is something bothering you?

47:49.800 --> 47:51.360
Where to?

47:53.210 --> 47:54.710
To Ganghwa-do.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.220
=It's such nice weather today.=

48:02.350 --> 48:05.300
=It's a perfect day for traveling.=

48:25.990 --> 48:27.400
What are you doing?

48:27.630 --> 48:28.900
Come and take a look!

48:41.460 --> 48:43.860
<i>Ramyeon, rice, kimchi...</i>

48:43.960 --> 48:45.750
<i>and a camp stove too.</i>

48:45.800 --> 48:50.100
Coming to such a place with plenty
of good food will lift up the mood also.

48:50.900 --> 48:51.960
Finally...

48:52.770 --> 48:53.530
Here.

48:54.440 --> 48:57.580
Barbecue pork! Barbecue pork!
Pork! Pork!

48:59.010 --> 49:00.790
I'll barbecue some for you.

49:03.250 --> 49:06.420
What? What is it?
Let me see!

49:13.590 --> 49:14.590
Geesh...

49:17.220 --> 49:19.050
This is so you.

49:24.170 --> 49:25.980
You prepared almost everything.

49:26.010 --> 49:29.370
But the tool box really looks like it.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.640
Seriously! What do we do now?

49:44.490 --> 49:45.980
Stupid! Stupid!

49:50.460 --> 49:51.460
Yesterday...

49:53.970 --> 49:55.180
You go first.

49:55.300 --> 49:58.000
Nothing.
Let's go shopping for a shroud!

49:58.100 --> 49:59.430
I'll help you look.

49:59.540 --> 50:02.690
Okay.
But I'll go to a different store.

50:02.710 --> 50:06.380
I checked around and I think
there is another good place.

50:07.220 --> 50:08.200
Fine.

50:10.020 --> 50:12.180
If oppa hits a lotto jackpot,

50:12.650 --> 50:15.330
will you buy me the gold shroud
we saw last time?

50:15.390 --> 50:20.080
If I win, of course I will.
Covered from head to toe
with gold and diamonds.

50:20.730 --> 50:23.500
I will also buy a new car for
my dongsaeng and his wife.

50:23.500 --> 50:27.370
I will renovate my sister-in-law's
art school.

50:27.630 --> 50:30.280
As a hyeong, I haven't
done anything for them.

50:30.470 --> 50:31.850
I need to repay them.

50:31.970 --> 50:34.290
Oh wow, such a gentleman.

50:34.410 --> 50:36.860
Don't you have anything you want to do?

50:36.910 --> 50:40.020
Me? Of course I do.

50:40.910 --> 50:45.350
First of all, I will buy a huge motorcycle.

50:46.190 --> 50:49.110
Right! And wear a very cool leather jacket.

50:49.190 --> 50:51.190
Riding on the motorbike
traveling around the world,

50:51.360 --> 50:53.690
from Europe to Africa.

50:55.030 --> 50:58.450
To travel from Europe to Africa...

50:59.000 --> 51:01.300
you would have to use an airplane
to transport it.

51:01.670 --> 51:06.820
- I think so.
- But, don't you know that we aren't
allowed to board an airplane?

51:07.010 --> 51:12.320
- Why?
- According to the doctor it will increase the
brain pressure and we can die from that.
So, no airplanes.

51:12.350 --> 51:13.350
=Really?=

51:13.650 --> 51:15.520
Why didn't he tell me that?

51:15.580 --> 51:18.190
Then, should we go by boat?

51:18.220 --> 51:21.710
For a person whose life depends
on the lotto tickets,
your dream is a little too simple.

51:26.700 --> 51:29.580
That's true.
I'm not a greedy person.

51:29.730 --> 51:32.070
Then give it to me.

51:32.130 --> 51:34.050
I'll help you hold on to it.

51:34.370 --> 51:36.270
The air is so fresh here.

51:36.370 --> 51:39.010
If we pick this place, which tree
would you like to be buried under?

51:39.040 --> 51:41.260
Me? The chestnut tree.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.290
Don't you think a chestnut tree is a bit...

51:44.310 --> 51:45.580
What?

51:45.710 --> 51:50.010
An unmarried young maiden being
buried under a chestnut tree is a bit...

51:50.520 --> 51:51.790
It's nothing.

51:53.290 --> 51:55.870
I like chestnut flowers.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.750
Can't a young maiden lie under
the fragrant flowers?

51:58.760 --> 52:00.820
Look at you, you knew!

52:00.930 --> 52:03.360
You don't need to know such a thing.

52:03.730 --> 52:05.630
I researched chestnut trees.

52:05.730 --> 52:08.280
Do you know why I insist on
it being a chestnut tree?

52:08.670 --> 52:14.760
I used to think that if I bought a house,
I would plant a chestnut tree in the yard.

52:14.810 --> 52:17.560
Just like my grandmother's house.

52:27.320 --> 52:28.320
Why?

52:29.790 --> 52:32.180
I need to relieve myself.

52:33.130 --> 52:34.420
Don't peep!

52:34.460 --> 52:37.150
What? Can't you hold it?
Is it convenient here?

53:21.010 --> 53:22.880
- You peeped, didn't you?
- Are you nuts?

53:22.980 --> 53:24.950
Quickly wipe your hands!

53:25.140 --> 53:26.290
Nuisance!

53:27.650 --> 53:29.540
But, this is a bit unfair.

53:29.650 --> 53:31.640
You should drive.

53:32.420 --> 53:34.050
- Really?
- Really.

53:34.090 --> 53:35.390
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

53:35.390 --> 53:37.040
- No regrets?
- No regrets.

53:37.720 --> 53:39.220
Slow down!
Slow down!

53:39.440 --> 53:40.580
Really...

53:41.190 --> 53:42.810
You are such a lousy driver!

53:43.030 --> 53:44.310
I don't have a license.

53:44.360 --> 53:45.630
What? Are you crazy?

53:45.660 --> 53:48.000
Then why are you driving?

53:48.170 --> 53:50.490
They keep telling me that I flunk,
so what can I do then?

53:50.500 --> 53:52.320
Don't force me or I'll step on it!
I'll pass it sooner or later.

53:52.340 --> 53:54.460
We'll be dead before you
get your driver license.

53:54.510 --> 53:55.920
Big mouth!

53:56.010 --> 53:57.310
Wait a minute...

53:57.840 --> 53:59.850
- Watch the speed! Watch the speed!
- I know.

54:00.180 --> 54:02.710
Watch the lane!
Merge to this side.

54:09.360 --> 54:10.780
So fun!

54:10.860 --> 54:13.990
I would rather live a longer life
than have such fun.

54:14.030 --> 54:15.480
Slow down.

54:25.270 --> 54:28.520
My neck!

54:28.770 --> 54:33.560
Oh my God, Jesus Christmas!
How the hell did such a big accident happen?
You people...

54:36.620 --> 54:38.670
My leg also feels uncomfortable.
Come over here!

54:38.720 --> 54:41.130
- Over here! We need to talk! Get out!
- You stay here. I'll go.

54:41.150 --> 54:42.760
Get out! Aren't you getting out?

54:42.790 --> 54:44.880
Hit and run.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.330
- Hit and run.
- She just learned.

54:46.430 --> 54:47.430
I'm really sorry.

54:47.590 --> 54:50.240
Ajussi, how could she drive like that?

54:50.600 --> 54:52.400
I was subjected to
a tremendous blow.

54:52.730 --> 54:55.910
From my neck to my leg.
People could die, you know.

54:55.970 --> 54:57.750
- Sorry.
- Excuse me!

54:57.800 --> 55:01.430
Don't be so trashy!
Just call the insurance company.

55:01.470 --> 55:03.730
What?  Trashy? Hey!

55:03.810 --> 55:05.520
You! Come here!
I said come here!

55:05.640 --> 55:07.610
Hey!  Who are you calling trashy?

55:07.780 --> 55:10.110
Damn it! What are you doing?

55:10.120 --> 55:13.770
- Did you just say "damn it"?
- Because I didn't say anything,
do you take me for an idiot?

55:13.790 --> 55:16.290
- This punk seriously...
- What? Say it! What?

55:16.460 --> 55:17.960
What a bum!

55:18.260 --> 55:20.250
Come over here, come here.

55:20.430 --> 55:22.560
You better follow me while
I'm still saying it nicely.

55:22.700 --> 55:25.610
- I'm coming.
- Over here, you bastard!

55:25.700 --> 55:28.200
- Seriously...
- I'm coming.

55:28.370 --> 55:30.800
- Let go of me!
- I'm so sorry.

55:30.840 --> 55:34.920
Did I scare you?
Please take this and treat
yourself to a nice meal.

55:34.970 --> 55:37.440
I was afraid of losing face in front of
the woman. I'm so sorry.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.450
Give me more.

55:39.450 --> 55:41.570
You bastard!

55:41.950 --> 55:45.870
This... this...
I bought this from a lotto shop in Sangjung.
It's a guarantee you'll win. I'm sorry.

55:45.950 --> 55:47.070
Why are you giving me a lotto ticket?

55:47.090 --> 55:49.360
Try to be fierce again and
you'll see, bastard!

55:52.190 --> 55:54.860
Must be tired of living...

55:55.700 --> 55:59.830
That bastard, trying to act tough?

56:02.000 --> 56:03.800
Why are you cursing at others?

56:03.840 --> 56:05.660
You've never cursed others
in your entire life?

56:05.670 --> 56:07.150
No, I haven't.

56:07.170 --> 56:08.670
Seriously? Not even once in your lifetime?

56:08.680 --> 56:10.110
Not even once.

56:10.110 --> 56:11.320
Why?

56:11.380 --> 56:14.590
I had planned to have some fun before
I got married into a decent family.

56:15.050 --> 56:16.690
So old-fashioned.

56:16.720 --> 56:18.850
Sometimes you need to curse and swear
to feel more like a human.

56:18.880 --> 56:21.200
How is it possible to be alive
without cursing?

56:21.690 --> 56:25.460
I'm not sure about other stuff,
but I am quite confident of my physique.

56:25.520 --> 56:29.200
If I didn't curse at people,
I would absolutely die from being angry.

56:29.260 --> 56:31.990
It's so unfair.
I am a good-natured person.

56:32.730 --> 56:35.160
Darn! I feel like cursing again.

56:38.540 --> 56:40.050
Damn it.

56:41.210 --> 56:42.820
How can you vent your anger
by saying it like that?

56:42.840 --> 56:44.110
Louder! Like this.

56:44.110 --> 56:45.820
Damn it!
Like that.

56:45.950 --> 56:47.850
Damn it!
Oh, that's true.

56:47.910 --> 56:50.040
I feel a bit relieved.

56:50.050 --> 56:51.750
Have I ever lied to you?

56:53.760 --> 56:55.450
Damn it!

56:55.890 --> 56:58.040
I feel so wronged!

56:58.690 --> 57:00.610
So do I!

57:02.800 --> 57:05.570
If we can survive this year,

57:05.630 --> 57:09.130
next year will definitely be better, right?

57:10.100 --> 57:12.610
We'll be happier!

57:14.270 --> 57:18.090
I used to think it could happen.

57:20.110 --> 57:22.480
What the hell is this?

57:22.750 --> 57:25.340
Why are you treating me like this
all the time?

58:05.360 --> 58:07.450
I'm leaving.
Thanks for today.

58:07.530 --> 58:08.830
You're welcome.

58:09.500 --> 58:11.800
- Go in!
- I'm going.

58:16.670 --> 58:17.870
Hey.

58:23.210 --> 58:25.750
Nothing. Good night.

58:27.810 --> 58:29.510
In that case, I'm going.

58:29.980 --> 58:30.820
Okay.

58:39.990 --> 58:41.750
Hey, hey, hey!
What's wrong?

58:42.460 --> 58:44.310
Song Gyeong, what's wrong with you?

58:44.330 --> 58:45.500
Are you all right?

58:47.170 --> 58:48.850
Get up, get up.

58:50.890 --> 58:52.620
Did you hurt yourself?

58:52.670 --> 58:54.170
I'm sorry.

58:55.170 --> 58:56.710
Are you really okay?

58:58.840 --> 59:00.560
Are you worrying about me?

59:07.520 --> 59:09.960
Should I give you some of my endorphin?

59:10.020 --> 59:12.130
What endorphin?

59:14.690 --> 59:16.160
Hey...

59:16.960 --> 59:19.450
You should've given me a hint beforehand.

59:19.600 --> 59:23.820
I want to save it.
My entire life, I just spent as much
as the size of my fingernail.

59:32.480 --> 59:35.780
A driver for the sports academy?

59:36.060 --> 59:37.630
How did you...?

59:37.710 --> 59:39.760
Anyway, then what...?

59:40.090 --> 59:41.980
Nothing, it's just...

59:43.820 --> 59:45.550
I kissed him first.

59:46.160 --> 59:48.990
Are you nuts?
You should have waited for him.

59:49.850 --> 59:51.660
What should I do?

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:03.180
I should've kissed her first!

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.850
You're dead meat!

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:17.000
Uhhh...

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.860
Will you be...

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.700
my girlfriend?

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:31.880
I heard that once you've gotten to
a certain age, in order to cut off fate
and destiny you become more ruthless.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:33.640
Why don't we do it like this for now, okay?

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.970
Of course.

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.390
Isn't this what life is all about?

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.240
Everybody is the same.

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:44.420
That's true.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.000
Oppa is very good at driving,

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:49.050
very nice,

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:50.590
and strong enough to move heavy stuff.

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:54.000
Are you picking out a slave or what?

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.790
Well...?

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.100
I'm thinking.

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:04.600
What's there to think about?

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:27.680
I'm excited!

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.530
Are you home?

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:06.070
I had a great time today.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.050
I want to see you tomorrow. Sweet dreams.
You'll only have a sweet dream if you dream
about me. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.940
That...

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.220
Hello?

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.920
I also had a great time today.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.140
I also want to see you tomorrow.
Have a good sleep and sweet dreams.

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:30.790
A sweet dream is when you
dream about me.

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.090
You too.

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:33.590
I know, right?

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:37.760
By the way...

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:40.800
I have a bit of a bad temper.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.340
That's why I sometimes
become so detestable.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.940
If I ever tell you to get lost,
don't listen to me.

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:48.770
After a while, you still have to come back,
you hear me?

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:51.360
You have found the right person.
This is my specialty.

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:57.030
I finally managed to dodge the bird poop!

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.570
We can do it!
We can absolutely do it!

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.520
Victory! I can do it!

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:36.960
Why did we go to such a faraway place?

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:41.640
Because the netizens across the whole
of Korea voted this as the most tasty
vending machine coffee.

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.060
Looks like you did your homework.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.720
As much as I can.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.800
-=Song Gyeong is mine.=-

01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:15.160
That...

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:17.000
Should we head back now?

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.170
It's almost midnight.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:23.260
So... just go home like this?

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.270
You come with a beautiful girl like me
and you want us to leave just like that?

01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:36.580
Then you...

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:38.680
is not going home okay with you?

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:41.510
You should stop me from leaving.
Crying, begging...

01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:44.350
screaming while you jump into the sea.

01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.190
I even brought my uniform with me.

01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:04.400
Do you want to go home early tonight?

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.740
What?

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.080
What then?
You said it's almost midnight.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:13.770
Yes, yes.

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:16.150
It's time to go home.

01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:17.820
Hurry!

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.590
I also wanted to go home early.

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:29.930
Why are you staring at me like that?
It's so nauseating.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.760
Close your eyes!

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:37.070
Men... Okay, I understand.

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:52.020
What's this?
I'm going to open my eyes.

01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:15.170
What are you doing here?

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.700
Take this.

01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:29.990
~ <i>What kind of secret could there be?</i> ~

01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:34.460
~ <i>Us, who are so impatient in the beginning...</i> ~

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.300
~ <i>Although I pretend that I don't really care,</i> ~

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.470
~ <i>I actually like it very much.</i> ~

01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:45.470
~ <i>Everything that's said today...</i> ~

01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:50.480
~ <i>I will keep it all in my heart.</i> ~

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:57.150
~ <i>My love for you is like spring,
warm and fresh.</i> ~

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:02.710
~ <i>If we ever have a falling-out,</i> ~

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:06.790
~ <i>I will be the one who apologizes.</i> ~

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:09.930
~ <i>Although I have a lot of flaws</i> ~

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:13.400
~ <i>I naively sweet talk you.</i> ~

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:18.540
~ <i>I am grateful to you...</i> ~

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.040
~ <i>for accepting plain old me.</i> ~

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:29.550
~ <i>Gathering my courage to tell you,
I love you... I love you.</i> ~

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.020
What's this all about?

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.830
Our 30-day anniversary.

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:42.660
We are different from the rest of the world.

01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:45.830
As long as our hearts still beating,
we have the right to be in love.

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.800
We don't have much time left,

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:51.970
so 30 days, 40 days, 50 days...

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.439
need to be commemorated.

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:58.240
Great! Let's do it like that.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:28.350
Oppa...

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:33.279
You only came back now?

01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:35.609
Where have you been?

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:39.770
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:41.439
What are all these?

01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:44.500
What happened?

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.560
Why didn't you say anything?

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.750
Shouldn't you have told us
from the beginning?

01:09:54.069 --> 01:09:56.070
I wanted to.

01:09:57.570 --> 01:09:59.240
But...

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:10.250
I'm all right, okay?

01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:30.100
Drink this!

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.270
What's this?

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:32.770
Just drink it!

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.940
There isn't any incurable disease nowadays.

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:37.440
Everything is curable.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.250
I heard that for 200 million Won,
even a terminal liver cancer patient
can be cured.

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:43.250
Where are we going to get
that 200 million?

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.260
What's so hard about that?
As long as we're determined,
we can do it.

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:48.490
We can put the house up for auction.

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:51.320
We also have a bit of savings,
so there's no need to be worried.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.660
You won't die.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.330
Everything will be all right.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:59.330
Don't cry!

01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:42.910
I already said nothing's wrong.

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:45.740
It was only a silly dream.

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.410
Mom,

01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:51.880
do you still remember the photo
that used to be in our room?

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:58.060
Every time when I look at that picture,
I think you looked so beautiful at that time.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.890
Of course you're still pretty now.

01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:04.900
Don't tell me that I'm so beautiful
because I take after you?

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:11.340
Mom, don't you miss me?

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:25.750
I did some research about this place.

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:29.960
They say this place has the most
second prize wins. That's why maybe
we should take a look.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.760
There is also a lottery stand that
will go bankrupt soon at the other place.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.260
First, let's have our lunch over there.

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.260
Drink up and then we'll go.

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.230
What's this?

01:12:36.230 --> 01:12:38.600
It's good stuff, but it's better to
pinch your nose while you drink it.

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:42.000
Drink up!

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:46.810
I'm not going to buy
any lotto tickets today.

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:51.810
Then what do you want to do?

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.950
I've never even set foot in here,
and now we're actually coming here?

01:12:57.950 --> 01:13:00.030
Why? You want to be
born again in paradise?

01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:02.970
If it were up to me,
I wouldn't let you have it your way.

01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:05.060
This is also your first time
coming here, right?

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:06.060
Yes.

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:17.020
You always want to do
what other people do.

01:13:17.170 --> 01:13:19.000
Isn't it said that Buddhism
is about compassion?

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.140
It's certainly different
from your bad temper.

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:24.310
Come! Let's pray.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.550
Someone you know?

01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:05.020
Come and say hello.
These are my parents.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.450
They died in a traffic accident
10 years ago.

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:14.160
Mom... Dad...

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:16.760
I have a girlfriend now.

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.700
Isn't she pretty?

01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:23.370
I know you both miss me very much.

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:25.540
Hang in there for a little while.

01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:30.040
She and I will come and look for you soon.

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:03.030
<i>What did you pray for, just now?</i>

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:05.440
<i>It's nothing.</i>

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:07.610
<i>What about you, oppa?</i>

01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:10.520
<i>Me? Of course I prayed that
you'll be saved.</i>

01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:12.280
<i>Only me?</i>

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.920
<i>No, I also prayed that
I would be saved too.</i>

01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:18.660
<i>I knew you'd be like this.</i>

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.530
<i>You idiot!
You should've prayed for me alone.</i>

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:22.390
<i>Why?</i>

01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:25.200
<i>That way Buddha would be moved
by your sincerity</i>

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.700
<i>and answer your prayer.</i>

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.270
<i>What about me then?</i>

01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:34.210
<i>For oppa, I can come and pray for you.</i>

01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:36.940
<i>Oh no! Dear Buddha,
please save Dong Ju oppa.</i>

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.480
<i>I'm really going to be okay.</i>

01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:41.210
<i>I'm going to be just like that...</i>

01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:42.410
<i>That doesn't sound so bad.</i>

01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:44.220
<i>Of course not.</i>

01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:09.810
Really...

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.580
It has shrunk a lot since last time.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.150
What?

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.990
Looks like the family members
were hit hard.

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:26.160
If it stays like this,
perhaps we can give surgery a try.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.210
Anyway,

01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:30.300
there's something to look forward to.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:32.300
That's great!

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.630
See? I told you so.

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:34.800
Thank you very much, Doctor.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.470
What's with you?
Aren't you happy?

01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:39.470
Of course I am.

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:41.810
That's great then.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.920
Tada!

01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:49.480
How is it? Good or not?
Does it fit me well?

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.150
A must-have photo.

01:16:55.650 --> 01:16:57.320
Honey!

01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.830
One more.

01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:03.160
What's that endorphin guy doing lately?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.670
Probably doing nothing
and talking nonsense.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.670
I see that you've been smiling a lot lately.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.340
Bride, please come over here.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.400
What did the doctor say?

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:41.400
Nothing important.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.620
So...

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.740
What exactly did the doctor say?
He must have said something.

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:55.990
I'm tired.

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:58.750
I want to lie down.

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:33.420
How is it? Suitable or not?

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.250
Like a vampire.

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.920
Am I that sexy?

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.590
What kind of logic is that?

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.730
Do you want to step in here and try?

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:49.900
I think it will be better for you to
lie on your tummy in the coffin.

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:51.900
Why?

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.910
Because your ass is very sexy.

01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:57.240
My ass is very sexy?

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.240
Yeah.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.920
It's a little uncomfortable in here,
let's get up.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.560
That's true. How can we talk about
something as uncertain as that?

01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:16.860
Or you don't feel like talking to me?

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:19.030
What's the difference?

01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:23.700
Why do you keep asking me?

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.170
Because I'm curious.

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.340
I think it's going to look great.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.680
What? You want to get your hair done?

01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:41.690
Song Gyeong! What brought you here?

01:19:42.190 --> 01:19:43.360
Song Gyeong!

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.660
I happened to be in the neighborhood,
so I decided to stop by.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:46.830
Who is he?

01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:48.160
Your boyfriend?

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.160
No!

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:55.670
How do you do, miss?
My name is Gang Dong Ju.

01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:59.810
Song Gyeong talked about you a few times.
You look better than I imagined.

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:00.970
I know, right?

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:03.280
I was only telling the truth.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.580
Where did you meet this
handsome guy?

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.410
- Aunt, come on!
- What?

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:10.420
We met at the fan club.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.250
What kind of fan club?

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:14.750
The malignant tumor fan club?

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:16.760
Would you like a cup of coffee?

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.760
Yes, let's.

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.760
Stay a while, okay?

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.260
I planned to.

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:25.930
But then again, why did you bring me here?

01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:28.430
Because today is Saturday.

01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:29.940
What's with Saturday?

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.270
I forgot to buy lotto tickets.
Damn it!

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:40.450
Did you buy these?

01:20:58.130 --> 01:21:01.430
Time really flies.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.600
Well, what can I do?
I still need to match the tickets.

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:12.780
=The first ball.
This ball is...=

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:15.250
=Number 23 red.
Number 23 red.=

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:18.080
It's 23! 23!

01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:20.150
=Number 19 blue.=

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.820
You see! You see!
It's number 19.

01:21:23.290 --> 01:21:24.400
=The third ball...=

01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:26.760
=Also blue... number 14.=

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.930
=The sixth ball is coming up.=

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.030
=Number 21 Red.=

01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:36.870
Look! I hit 4 numbers.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.170
I hit 4 numbers!

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:46.480
I'll buy out all the coffee here.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.570
This is where "The Happy Home" is.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.300
"The Happy Home?"

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.540
Just listening to the name gives me
the feeling of being scammed.

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:17.840
It's nothing like that. A lot of patients who've
been diagnosed with illnesses who came here
for treatment were healed and went home.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:19.850
I found this out after
spending a lot of effort.

01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:26.650
Hello.

01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:28.790
Welcome!

01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:30.420
I called yesterday.
My name is Gang Dong Ju.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.390
Oh, is that so?

01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:35.030
- Please, come this way.
- Yes.

01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:39.500
This place is quite new.

01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:43.670
My only thought when building this place

01:22:43.670 --> 01:22:46.000
was to let these people go through happy
moments during their last minutes of life.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.010
However, I didn't expect that many miracles
would actually happen here.

01:22:51.010 --> 01:22:53.480
So, news spread by word of mouth.

01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:57.420
So, is it coincidental?

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.490
I'm not sure either.
It's probably not entirely coincidental.

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:04.690
You see this person over here?

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:11.200
Since coming here,
he has published a comic on the internet.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.030
It's been 3 years now.

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:15.340
This one is...

01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:18.600
Her name is Seong Eun.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:20.770
She is a novelist and a volunteer.

01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:25.220
One person is painting,
and the other one is writing.

01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:28.380
Those two turned out to be a perfect match.

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:44.870
Stay seated.
I'll get the door for you.

01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:01.410
Let's apply for admission next week.

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.550
Let's go.

01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:11.720
Don't think about anything else
until I come and pick you up.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.730
I'm leaving.

01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.500
Oppa...

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.710
Can you give me a hug, please?

01:24:57.970 --> 01:24:59.140
Sleep well.

01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:00.810
Go on.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.820
I love you.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.050
<i>The tumor has progressed
faster than anticipated.</i>

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.690
<i>Now is the time for you</i>

01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:56.030
<i>to be mentally prepared.</i>

01:26:23.890 --> 01:26:25.360
Are you done packing?

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.200
Don't tell me you haven't even started yet.

01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:32.030
It doesn't take a genius to figure out.

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:34.500
=I'm not going.=

01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:38.300
What's wrong with you all of the sudden?

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:42.140
=I think we should take a break.=

01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:45.980
Stop wanting to do things
like other people do.

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.650
We're different from others.

01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:49.950
We can't afford to take it slow.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.450
Hello?

01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:53.950
Hello?

01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:05.400
=The number you have dialed is switched off.
You will be directed to voice mail.=

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.930
=Please leave a message after the beep.=

01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:18.910
What's wrong with you?
Why? Why? Why? Why?

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:55.980
So beautiful!

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:01.120
Congratulations!

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.530
Wear them well.

01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:14.700
=Bride and groom, please enter.=

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.640
=They look so affectionate together.=

01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:21.640
=Please give them a warm
round of applause.=

01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:24.810
=Let's wish them well in
every step they take.=

01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:43.100
You really don't want to go?

01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:44.760
I already told you so.

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.270
Then let's go to the hospital together
and receive treatment there.

01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:49.770
I think I said that earlier.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.110
If it's worth it, I will go.

01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:54.610
I have done everything I can.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.280
Now, nothing matters anymore.

01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:58.380
What have you done?

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.710
To what extent?

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.880
By the way, did I tell you that
I'm going to go to Ganghwa-do?

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.720
I just paid for that not long ago.

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:06.720
What?

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.890
Although it's a bit far,
of the places that we've been to,
it's the most--

01:29:08.890 --> 01:29:10.890
Enough! O Song Gyeong...

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:12.560
Enough is enough!

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.730
Go pack your stuff and come with me!

01:29:22.730 --> 01:29:24.400
It's not over yet.

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.000
What's not over?

01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:28.470
What's wrong with you all of the sudden?

01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:33.310
Up until now, I have been constantly
planning for my future, persistently trying
to stay alive every minute, every second,

01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:37.620
thinking that if I was together with
that person, perhaps I could
smile happily also.

01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.120
So I don't plan to develop any kind of hope.

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.320
I even had a ridiculous thought that
if I smiled more often, perhaps my
illness would get better.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.160
It feels like I've turned into an idiot.

01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:49.130
I have become a fool like you.

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.800
It's been hard enough to
take care of myself alone.

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.570
What can two sick people
do together, anyway?

01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:57.840
Who dies first?
What's going to happen
to the one left behind?

01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:00.670
What's the other one going to do?

01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:04.680
I'm scared enough already.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:07.350
Being together with you,
I still have to worry about you.

01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:08.650
Haven't you thought about that?

01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:09.820
What are you going to do then?

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.320
You see?

01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:19.590
Your brain can't think straight.

01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:22.860
Day after day,
waiting for death to come.

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.370
You neither think nor plan anything.

01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:29.870
I've had enough of you.

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.210
Song Gyeong, wait!

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:47.720
For you, I want to live a longer life.

01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:49.720
What about you?

01:30:50.890 --> 01:30:52.220
Why can't you think like this?

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.890
I also want to stay alive.

01:30:54.730 --> 01:30:56.400
I really really want to.

01:30:59.230 --> 01:31:00.400
But, never mind.

01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:02.570
It's over now.

01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:50.440
Smile a little!

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.440
Ready?

01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:55.180
1, 2, 3...

01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:31.820
As a patient, your request is quite harsh.

01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:34.450
A bad influence from someone.

01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:38.320
It feels so comfortable here.

01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:43.200
How was the honeymoon?

01:33:44.630 --> 01:33:46.630
We're not ready yet.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.320
Everything is in such a mess.

01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:50.440
How is Song Gyeong?

01:33:54.670 --> 01:33:56.880
I can't contact her, that silly girl!

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:02.980
She left a housing contract,

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.750
deposit book,

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:09.390
and some kind of phone number
of the graveyard in Ganghwa-do.

01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:13.090
She tries to act tough.

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:14.260
In fact, she is a...

01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:17.100
a patient who wishes to be cared for.
O Song Gyeong, that silly girl!

01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:20.430
She said some people complained

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.600
that the funeral parlor is too far away
and wanted some parking coupons.

01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:26.740
So, she has prepared the parking coupons.

01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.210
It seems like she went to the countryside.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.710
Grandma,

01:35:08.110 --> 01:35:10.780
is this number going to be displayed
on the caller ID?

01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:57.100
Here?

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:01.270
Up a bit. Yes...
Feels so good.

01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:02.430
Yes, right there.

01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:07.020
Mom.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:07.870
Yeah?

01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:10.440
Why don't I keep you company everyday?

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:13.280
You want to torture me everyday.

01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:16.280
When are you leaving?

01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:18.650
Tomorrow.

01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:20.950
Is that so?

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:23.290
How about I leave the day after tomorrow?

01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:28.290
It's okay.
You're busy. Just leave.

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.360
It's okay.
Then I'll stay for one more day.

01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:35.570
But then again, do you really

01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:37.600
not have any boyfriend?

01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:41.370
You're not getting any younger.

01:36:41.370 --> 01:36:43.640
Find a decent man and get married.

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.210
Not again.

01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:49.820
It can't be forced.

01:36:50.650 --> 01:36:52.820
I am such a beauty and you're worried
that nobody would want to marry me?

01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.140
Mom,

01:36:59.490 --> 01:37:01.190
let me tell you a joke.

01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:05.260
Do you know the opposite
of a mountain bunny?

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.710
Mom?

01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:26.550
Tomorrow is your surgery,
have a good rest.

01:37:26.690 --> 01:37:28.190
Relax.

01:37:29.150 --> 01:37:30.290
Everything will be okay.

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.390
It feels so quiet when you're not laughing.

01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:37.860
I understand.  Go back now.

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.100
We're leaving then.
Go to sleep.

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:46.940
Gang Dong Min,

01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:48.110
Lee Yu Nab...

01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:53.180
Thank you.

01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:55.050
Gang Dong Ju...

01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.820
be sensible, okay?

01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:22.210
=I saw you taking the medicine.=

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:23.640
=The first time driving=

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.310
=that van.=

01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:26.680
=Really?=

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.350
=Did you take a peek?=

01:38:29.110 --> 01:38:31.120
- =You took some medicine.=
- =Took what medicine?=

01:38:34.650 --> 01:38:35.790
=You liked=

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.420
=me just like that?=

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:39.530
=That's not true.
It's you who liked me first.=

01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:41.860
- =I was only... it was you who asked me out.=
- =It's you, oppa, who liked me first.=

01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:43.400
- =It was you.=
- =When did I ever ask you out?=

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:45.360
=It was you who asked me
to go with you.=

01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:46.370
=That's not it. It was because...=

01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:47.370
=Try saying it!=

01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:48.530
=Oppa, do you like me?=

01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:51.540
=I really can't tell.=

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.170
- =So?=
- =Stop... stop...=

01:38:54.370 --> 01:38:55.370
It's really delicious.

01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:57.340
That's why...

01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:59.180
you shouldn't starve yourself.
Eat more!

01:38:59.650 --> 01:39:00.610
Okay, I understand.

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.540
Someone is coming to fix the heater
this afternoon.

01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:08.390
It's better to fix it now.

01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:10.310
How did you get by all these years?

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.880
I saw that the gas pipe
also needed some work.

01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:15.910
It's perfectly fine.
No need to make a fuss about it.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.480
Prior to the surgery, please remove
any jewelry and contact lenses.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:38.820
I need the guardian's signature as well.
I'll go and prepare.

01:39:38.980 --> 01:39:39.750
Okay.

01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:44.000
Let's go.

01:39:55.930 --> 01:39:58.100
- =Right?=
- =How could I possibly?=

01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:00.940
=Wait! It's backlit.=

01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:02.480
=Over here... come!=

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:05.080
- =Okay, excuse me Miss O Song Gyeong...=
- =Yes?=

01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:08.130
=What is your first impression
of Mr. Gang Dong Ju?=

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:11.060
=I really don't remember
the first time we met.=

01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:22.220
Hello?

01:40:22.730 --> 01:40:23.560
Where are you going?

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.000
Hello?

01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:11.340
May I ask how can I get there?

01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:04.500
She looks smart and very beautiful.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.500
She came from Seoul not long ago.
She didn't live here.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.300
It sounds like Ye Seong's daughter.

01:42:10.300 --> 01:42:11.400
Ye Seong's house.

01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:21.710
Song Gyeong!

01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:23.680
O Song Gyeong!

01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:29.920
Is Song Gyeong here?

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.030
O Song Gyeong.

01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:34.830
O Song Gyeong!

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:37.230
I'm not really sure.

01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:40.360
Isn't this O Song Gyeong's house?

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:41.830
No.

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.340
It's not?

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.510
No.

01:42:50.010 --> 01:42:51.190
I'm sorry.

01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:09.030
Song Gyeong!

01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:11.860
O Song Gyeong!

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:14.430
Song Gyeong!

01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:23.040
Song Gyeong!

01:43:26.210 --> 01:43:26.890
Song Gyeong!

01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:35.590
Song Gyeong!

01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:38.240
O Song Gyeong!

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:44.990
I...

01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:47.330
I'm also very scared.

01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:50.480
How could I possibly not be afraid?

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:53.410
I am more scared because of you.

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.240
Sometimes...

01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.020
I regret the way we came
to know each other.

01:45:01.710 --> 01:45:04.030
The one who is left behind will be very sad,

01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:08.010
will be very scared,

01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.220
very lonely...

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.330
But, Song Gyeong...

01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:16.920
Let's not think about all of that.

01:45:17.890 --> 01:45:20.060
If we feel like laughing,
we'll laugh heartily.

01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:24.980
If we want to see each other,
we just meet. Can't we?

01:45:25.630 --> 01:45:27.310
You miss me too, right?

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:33.340
Yes, I missed you very much.

01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:34.920
I like you.

01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:36.110
But...

01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:38.920
The more time I spend with you,

01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:41.100
the more I'll like you.

01:45:44.650 --> 01:45:46.550
If you died before me,

01:45:47.290 --> 01:45:49.520
I would miss you.
What would I do then?

01:45:49.790 --> 01:45:51.380
If I died before you...

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:53.520
We don't have that much time to waste.

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:56.810
Do you know how many things
we have to do?

01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:00.970
On the 8th, 1 o'clock,

01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:04.070
Busan traditional squid restaurant.

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:05.770
On the 9th, 3 o'clock,

01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:07.990
Apply for a driver license.

01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:09.910
On the 11th, 12 o'clock,

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:13.000
Meet the Chief of the National Cancer Society,
Gim Min Seok.

01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:16.170
- On the 12th, go check out a necklace.
- Okay. Enough!

01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:19.330
Listen to me first.
You will change your mind.

01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:23.040
On the 13th, go to Baehan-san.
14th, to Janghan-do.

01:46:24.490 --> 01:46:26.450
What took you so long to come?

01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:30.180
Didn't I say, if I told you to get lost,
to leave but then come and look for
me again?

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.770
What took you so long to come?

01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:44.280
I miss you till I feel like dying.

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:30.820
Here.

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:32.620
Bride and groom...

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:34.910
please enter.

01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:41.140
So cool!

01:47:41.230 --> 01:47:42.070
Yeah!

01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:51.020
Everyone knows that today
these two people,

01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:53.080
whom I will personally confirm

01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:56.080
can only live for 3 months.

01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:58.030
This man and woman...

01:47:58.050 --> 01:47:59.050
at this very moment

01:47:59.050 --> 01:48:02.050
are standing before me as bride and groom.

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:05.560
You all need not worry.

01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:09.530
These two will take care and accompany
each other in time of need.

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.200
Today, in front of family and relatives,

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.200
they have something to express.

01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:16.660
They have prepared their vows.

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.200
Let them read them out loud for us.

01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:20.990
Please face each other.

01:48:22.170 --> 01:48:22.960
Here.

01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:30.010
Seeing you, Dong Su,
makes me feel so fortunate.

01:48:30.850 --> 01:48:34.160
Just like you said before, no matter
what's going to happen tomorrow,

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.300
I still have to be grateful

01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:38.060
for every moment of life

01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:40.230
to enjoy happiness.

01:48:41.730 --> 01:48:43.400
Thank you for teaching me how to smile.

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.240
According to the truth of the universe,
I should be able to hit a lotto jackpot.

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.760
But how come I've never won anything?

01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:56.240
I obviously could have, but how come
I've never won anything?

01:48:56.410 --> 01:48:58.240
I thought it a thousand times,
even ten thousand times.

01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:02.750
But, since I met you...

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:06.720
I finally found out that I've never won
any lotto because I was going to meet you.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.270
Kiss... Kiss...

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.640
I hereby

01:49:22.130 --> 01:49:23.380
pronounce them

01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:24.970
husband and wife!

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:28.640
Bride and groom...

01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:30.260
chin up!

01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.170
March forward!

01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:33.560
Congratulations!

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.270
Congratulations!

01:50:40.710 --> 01:50:43.050
These people are the
newly-joined members?

01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:44.520
Yes, boss.

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:46.350
But...

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.190
According to my 7 years of experience,

01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:50.520
I feel that

01:50:50.690 --> 01:50:52.020
this person

01:50:53.660 --> 01:50:57.830
and this one here,
are perfect for each other.

01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:59.830
You think these two are perfect
for each other?

01:51:00.170 --> 01:51:03.340
Very much so.
I can feel it.

01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:04.340
You can leave.

01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:11.340
But...

01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:14.010
when there are only two of us in the office,

01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:16.150
can you show some respect for me, honey?

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.600
I told you not to call me "honey" at work!

01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:21.030
Get out!
Get out of here!

01:51:21.090 --> 01:51:22.670
Shorty!

01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:25.260
- Get out!
- Yes, boss.

01:51:25.890 --> 01:51:27.180
How about this one?

01:51:27.730 --> 01:51:29.900
Not this one.
I want the one from Australia.

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:37.370
<i>I have a 48-square meter apartment
listed under my name.</i>

01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:40.040
<i>- Have you been on many blind dates?
- I drive an imported car.</i>

01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.540
<i>- No, I haven't.
- Nowadays, who drives domestic cars?</i>

01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:42.540
I think so too.

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:44.880
<i>You look good in red.</i>

01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:46.150
What do you do for a living?

01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:47.610
A bit here and there.

01:51:47.610 --> 01:51:49.620
My parents live in the countryside.

01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:52.280
<i>They've liked farm work
since they were young.</i>

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.950
<i>They also bought a huge piece of land.</i>

01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:55.450
I'm going to tell you a joke.

01:51:55.950 --> 01:51:56.620
<i>Anyway...</i>

01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:58.460
A burglar broke into a house of a fool.

01:51:58.460 --> 01:51:59.930
The burglar was quite ridiculous.

01:52:00.090 --> 01:52:01.590
He pointed a knife at
the fool's neck and said...

01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:04.600
Name three countries mentioned
in the Three Kingdoms period.
If you get them right, I'll spare you your life.

01:52:04.730 --> 01:52:06.400
<i>Guess, what's the fool's answer?</i>

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:07.730
No idea.

01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:09.740
A Cesarean!

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
- 010.6448.5007
- No manners!

24:39.000 --> 24:41.500
010.6448.5007

24:42.305 --> 24:48.470
