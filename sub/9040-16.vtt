00:11.500 --> 00:14.600
IT'S AS IF I SPEAK
IN TONGUES.

00:14.600 --> 00:17.167
DON'T TELL ME YOU FORGOT
ABOUT TOMORROW.

00:17.167 --> 00:20.300
- I WON'T.

00:20.300 --> 00:22.000

IN YOUR CHILDREN?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.300

00:23.300 --> 00:24.800
YES,

00:24.800 --> 00:26.100
I PICK THEM UP.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.400

YOU ARE INCREDIBLE!

00:49.433 --> 00:51.633
- SARAH!
I KNOW IT'S SARAH, OKAY?

00:51.633 --> 00:53.600
I WAS KIDDING YOU.
I KNOW IT'S SARAH.

00:53.600 --> 00:57.667
- YEAH,

00:59.100 --> 01:03.667
RAY, WHAT'S

01:28.933 --> 01:31.967
DAD, YOU WEARING AFTERSHAVE?

01:31.967 --> 01:34.200

01:34.200 --> 01:35.867

LIKE YOU SHAVED.

01:35.867 --> 01:40.633
- I DIDN'T SHOWER EITHER.
HENCE THE AFTERSHAVE.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.500
- NICE TRY.

01:46.500 --> 01:49.200
- OH.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

01:49.200 --> 01:51.200
- WATCHING THE KNICKS
ON THE DISH.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.567
- AND HOLDING OUR BREATH.
- GREAT.

01:54.567 --> 01:56.100
HEY, NO, GUYS,
GET OFF THE LAWN.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.433
GUYS, GO UPSTAIRS.

01:57.433 --> 01:58.867

01:58.867 --> 02:05.000
[boys yelling]

02:09.233 --> 02:12.700
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO THESE KIDS?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.033
- THEY'RE IN A PLAY.

02:14.033 --> 02:17.900
- LET ME GUESS,
"DEATH OF A SALESMAN."

02:17.900 --> 02:20.367
- JUST THIS THING AT SCHOOL.
THAT'S ALL.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.600
- A PLAY?
THAT'S A MISTAKE.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.267
GET THEM INTO SPORTS,
QUICK.

02:24.267 --> 02:26.367
- LOOK, IT'S A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
THAT'S ALL.

02:26.367 --> 02:27.767
THE WHOLE CLASS IS IN IT.

02:27.767 --> 02:29.400
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.967
LOOK AT THEM RUNNING AROUND
HERE LIKE A COUPLE OF SISSIES.

02:32.967 --> 02:34.167
- THEY'RE NOT SISSIES.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.433
- NO?
- NO.

02:35.433 --> 02:38.900
- WELL, THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE THEY?

02:38.900 --> 02:42.033
- THEY'RE FAIRIES.

02:42.033 --> 02:45.700
- OH, MY GOD!

02:45.700 --> 02:48.767
I'M TELLING YA,

02:48.767 --> 02:51.433
TENNIS, EVEN!

02:51.433 --> 02:52.467

02:52.467 --> 02:54.500
LOOK, THESE ARE THE PARTS

02:54.500 --> 02:55.800
THAT THEY WERE ASSIGNED,
ALL RIGHT?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.700
THAT'S IT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.767
- WELL, LISTEN TO THE KING
OF THE FAIRIES.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.167
- HI.
- HEY.

03:05.167 --> 03:07.600
- I TOOK DEBRA
GROCERY SHOPPING.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.467
NOW SHE KNOWS HOW
TO CHOOSE A CUT OF MEAT.

03:11.467 --> 03:14.433
- AND HUMILIATE A BUTCHER.

03:14.433 --> 03:16.900
- WE SHOULD GO SHOPPING
TOGETHER MORE OFTEN.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.333
- YEAH, I'LL CALL YOU.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.667
- THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE OUT,
YOU SHOULD GET

03:22.667 --> 03:24.633
A COUPLE OF SKIRTS
FOR YOUR TWINS THERE.

03:24.633 --> 03:25.900
- WHAT?

03:25.900 --> 03:27.300
- DAD'S MAD
'CAUSE THE BOYS ARE FAIRIES

03:27.300 --> 03:28.667
IN THE SCHOOL PLAY.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.500
- OH, THEY'LL MAKE
ADORABLE FAIRIES.

03:33.833 --> 03:35.267
- WELL, THEY ALREADY DO.

03:35.267 --> 03:37.733
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM
IN THE LITTLE WINGS.

03:37.733 --> 03:40.200
- SOMEBODY JUST KILL ME.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.467
- OH, FRANK, COME ON.

03:42.467 --> 03:43.467
- LOOK, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

03:43.467 --> 03:44.833
HE DID THE SAME THING TO ME

03:44.833 --> 03:46.533
WHEN I JOINED THE CHORUS
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE.

03:46.533 --> 03:49.067
YOU KNOW,
I WAS BASSO PROFUNDO.

03:49.067 --> 03:54.933
[singing]
OLD MAN RIVER

03:54.933 --> 03:56.100
- ALL RIGHT!

03:56.100 --> 03:59.933
- [singing]
THAT OLD MAN RIVER

03:59.933 --> 04:05.233
HE MUST KNOW SOMETHIN'

04:05.233 --> 04:09.467
HE DON'T SAY NOTHIN'

04:09.467 --> 04:11.267
- ALL RIGHT!

04:11.267 --> 04:13.900
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
ENOUGH!

04:13.900 --> 04:15.567
THAT'S HOW IT STARTS!

04:15.567 --> 04:16.767
- WHAT?

04:16.767 --> 04:18.233
- SINGING, DANCING.

04:18.233 --> 04:23.200
- SHOWERING REGULARLY.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.800
- WHY DON'T YOU GO
HANG SOME DRAPES?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.033
- OH, STOP IT, FRANK.

04:29.033 --> 04:31.767
I WAS SO SAD
WHEN HE QUIT CHORUS.

04:31.767 --> 04:35.300
- I HAD TO.
EVERYONE WAS MAKING FUN OF ME.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.733
- THAT'S WHY YOU QUIT?

04:36.733 --> 04:39.500
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY
MAKING FUN OF YOU.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.833
- DAD TOLD ME PEOPLE
WERE MAKING FUN OF ME.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.767
- WHAT PEOPLE?
WHO?

04:44.767 --> 04:46.200
- PEOPLE.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.533
- WHAT PEOPLE?

04:47.533 --> 04:52.133
- PEOPLE...
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.

04:52.133 --> 04:55.633
- IT WAS JUST YOU,
WASN'T IT, DAD?

04:55.633 --> 04:59.000
- I REPRESENT
THE COMMUNITY.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.533
OH, WHO CARES?

05:00.533 --> 05:02.600
THE NEXT DAY I PUT UP
THE BASKETBALL HOOP.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.633
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

05:03.633 --> 05:05.400
YOU HAD A SHELF FULL
OF TROPHIES.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.633
BY THE WAY,
WHEN ARE YOU

05:06.633 --> 05:09.167
GOING TO GET THAT CRAP
OUT OF MY HOUSE?

05:09.167 --> 05:11.400
- YEAH,
DAD NEEDS THAT SPACE

05:11.400 --> 05:15.600
FOR HIS "FATHER OF THE YEAR"
AWARDS.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.100
- WHAT,
ARE YOU CRACKING WISE?

05:17.100 --> 05:19.500
MY HARD WORK
IS THE ONLY REASON

05:19.500 --> 05:21.367
THE TWO OF YOU
AREN'T FLITTING AROUND HERE

05:21.367 --> 05:24.633
LIKE A COUPLE
OF TINKERBELLS.

05:24.633 --> 05:28.933
EVEN SO,
YOU'RE STILL A "BACHELOR."

05:28.933 --> 05:30.300
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.100
- YEAH, FRANK,
DRESSING THE TWINS LIKE FAIRIES

05:32.100 --> 05:33.767
IS NOT GOING
TO MAKE THEM GAY.

05:33.767 --> 05:39.233
- WELL, IT'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE THEM TEAMSTERS.

05:41.133 --> 05:45.433
- I'M SURE THERE ARE
GAY TEAMSTERS.

05:47.567 --> 05:51.233
- YOU, MADAM,
ARE IGNORANT.

05:51.233 --> 05:52.767
- OH, PLEASE.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.267
THIS WON'T MAKE THEM GAY.

05:54.267 --> 05:56.267
AND EVEN IF IT DOES,
IT'S FINE.

05:56.267 --> 05:58.800
IT'S BETTER THAN FINE;
IT'S WONDERFUL.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.500
WHO CARES WHAT THEY ARE
SO LONG AS THEY'RE HAPPY?

06:01.500 --> 06:05.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HOPE THEY DO TURN GAY.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.967
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
TO MAKE ME MAD!

06:08.967 --> 06:10.500
- AND WHY ARE YOU MAD?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.733
YOU THINK THAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

06:12.733 --> 06:14.200
THEM TURNING OUT LIKE YOU

06:14.200 --> 06:17.633
IS THE WORST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

06:17.633 --> 06:20.667
- SO EVERYONE'S FINE
WITH ALL OF THIS.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.500
HUH?

06:22.500 --> 06:23.633
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

06:23.633 --> 06:25.300
- WHAT ABOUT ME?

06:25.300 --> 06:27.400
- YOU'RE FINE WITH YOUR SONS
DRESSING UP LIKE FAIRIES

06:27.400 --> 06:29.200
FOR ALL OF LONG ISLAND
TO SEE?

06:29.200 --> 06:31.967
- FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S NOT IN FRONT

06:31.967 --> 06:33.633
OF ALL LONG ISLAND, OKAY?

06:33.633 --> 06:36.867
THERE'S 40 PEOPLE IN
THE SCHOOL'S CAFE-GYM-ATORIUM,

06:36.867 --> 06:38.167
ALL RIGHT?

06:43.067 --> 06:44.933
SECOND OF ALL,
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

06:44.933 --> 06:47.533
AREN'T YOU EMBARRASSED
TO TALK THAT WAY?

06:47.533 --> 06:48.567
- WHAT WAY?

06:48.567 --> 06:51.033
- YOU KNOW,
YOUR OLD STUPID IDEAS

06:51.033 --> 06:52.567
THAT YOU
AND YOUR LODGE BUDDIES

06:52.567 --> 06:57.000
SIT AROUND AND LAUGH AT
BETWEEN BOUTS OF GAS.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.700
- DON'T SAY NOTHING
ABOUT MY LODGE BUDDIES!

07:02.700 --> 07:07.033
- WHO, THE GUYS
YOU SWIM NAKED WITH?

07:09.033 --> 07:11.100
- THAT'S LODGE POLICY!

07:11.100 --> 07:14.000
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.400
IS IT--
IS IT LODGE POLICY

07:15.400 --> 07:17.400
TO FORCE YOUR OPINIONS
ON OTHER PEOPLE?

07:17.400 --> 07:18.833
LOOK, DAD,
THEY'RE MY KIDS, ALL RIGHT?

07:18.833 --> 07:20.767
I'LL RAISE THEM THE WAY
I WANT TO RAISE THEM.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.433
AND WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

07:25.367 --> 07:31.500
- HE DIDN'T SHOWER TODAY,
SO HE USED MY JEAN NATE.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.433
- WHAT?

07:33.433 --> 07:37.533
- YOU NEVER LOOK AT WHAT
YOU'RE PICKING UP IN THERE.

07:37.533 --> 07:40.033
- REALLY?
YOU'RE WEARING PERFUME, DAD?

07:42.867 --> 07:45.867
- SHUT UP.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.733
- YOU DO SMELL PURTY, PA.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.233
- WELL, I'M NOT SO SURE
I LIKE THE WAY

08:05.233 --> 08:08.133
I'M BEING TREATED HERE.

08:08.133 --> 08:11.100
IF ANY OF YOU WANT
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME,

08:11.100 --> 08:13.400
I'LL BE IN THE BATH.

08:15.133 --> 08:19.000
- WHO'S GOING TO APOLOGIZE
TO THE TUB?

08:20.767 --> 08:23.267
- OH, YOU MADE HIM
SO ANGRY, RAYMOND.

08:23.267 --> 08:27.033
- EH.
- YOU SHOULD DO THAT MORE OFTEN.

08:27.033 --> 08:28.700
- I'M PROUD OF YOU, HONEY.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.500
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ENOUGH ALREADY.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.767
- OH, I KNOW.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.067
YOU KNOW, I'LL TELL YOU,

08:34.067 --> 08:35.667
FRANK WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE BEEN HAPPIER

08:35.667 --> 08:37.967
IF I'D SIGNED THE KIDS UP
TO RUN THE TAPE RECORDER.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.267
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SIGN THEM UP?

08:40.267 --> 08:43.800
- YEAH, I SIGNED THEM UP.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.433
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU VOLUNTEERED THEM

08:46.433 --> 08:49.000
TO BE FAIRIES?
- YEAH.

08:51.667 --> 08:54.100
- WHY?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.233
- 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE CUTE

08:55.233 --> 08:56.500
TO SEE THEM WEAR
SPARKLY OUTFITS

08:56.500 --> 08:59.800
AND GET A CHANCE
TO DANCE.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.500
- DO THEY HAVE WANDS?
I COULD MAKE THEM WANDS.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.667
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

09:04.667 --> 09:05.900
YOU MADE THEM FAIRIES

09:05.900 --> 09:09.000
WHEN THERE WAS AN OPENING
AT TAPE RECORDER?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.567
- YEAH.

09:10.567 --> 09:12.367
- WELL, WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT?

09:12.367 --> 09:14.367
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:14.367 --> 09:16.067
YOU SAID YOU WERE FINE
WITH IT.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.167
- I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'M
NOT FINE WITH IT, ALL RIGHT?

09:18.167 --> 09:19.333
I AM.
I'M FINE WITH IT.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.200
- YOU DON'T SOUND FINE
WITH IT.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.900
- WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT WE HAD A CHOICE.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.867
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU
PUSHED THEM INTO THIS.

09:24.867 --> 09:26.233
- I DIDN'T PUSH THEM.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.433
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD LIKE IT,
AND THEY DO.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.667
THEY'RE HAVING FUN.

09:28.667 --> 09:31.033
- WH--FUN?
THEY'RE FIVE, OKAY?

09:31.033 --> 09:32.333
THEY HAVE FUN
WITH THE EMPTY ROLL

09:32.333 --> 09:35.000
FROM THE TOILET PAPER.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.867
- WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET?

09:36.867 --> 09:39.433
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SOUNDING
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

09:39.433 --> 09:42.000
- I'M NOT MY FATHER, OKAY?
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THAT.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.600
THIS IS ABOUT YOU
MAKING DECISIONS

09:43.600 --> 09:46.833
FOR OUR CHILDREN
THAT DON'T INVOLVE...

09:46.833 --> 09:49.933
THEIR FREE WILL.

09:49.933 --> 09:52.367
- OH, SO YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THEIR FREE WILL.

09:52.367 --> 09:55.533
- [chuckles]
NO, HE'S NOT.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.933
- WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

09:58.933 --> 10:01.767
- FREE WILL.

10:05.833 --> 10:07.667
- MAYBE YOU'RE MORE LIKE
YOUR FATHER THAN YOU THINK.

10:07.667 --> 10:10.733
- HEY, LOOK,
I AM NOT PREJUDICED.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.867
- YOU JUST DON'T WANT
YOUR BOYS TO BE FAIRIES.

10:12.867 --> 10:13.967
- LISTEN TO ME.

10:13.967 --> 10:15.567
IF MY CHILDREN COME HOME
AND SAY,

10:15.567 --> 10:18.467
"HEY, DAD, WE DECIDED TO BE
FAIRIES IN THE SCHOOL PLAY,"

10:18.467 --> 10:19.900
I'D SAY,
"HEY, GOOD FOR YOU, GUYS.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.233
GOOD, GUYS.
LET'S GO HAVE A ROOT BEER."

10:21.233 --> 10:22.567
HUH?
ALL RIGHT?

10:22.567 --> 10:24.967
MY FATHER DOESN'T DO THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

10:24.967 --> 10:27.200
I'M NOT MY FATHER.
WHAT?

10:27.200 --> 10:28.833
- YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM
A ROOT BEER.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.867
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO--YES.

10:30.867 --> 10:33.467
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE WORSE THAN YOUR FATHER

10:33.467 --> 10:35.000
BECAUSE AT LEAST
HE'S UP FRONT WITH IT.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.333
I MEAN,
YOU PRETEND TO BE LIBERAL,

10:36.333 --> 10:37.567
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED

10:37.567 --> 10:39.533
THAT YOUR BOYS
ARE PLAYING FAIRIES.

10:39.533 --> 10:40.733
- [coughs]
BULL'S-EYE.

10:40.733 --> 10:43.167
- HEY, SHUT UP.

10:43.167 --> 10:47.167
ALL RIGHT, JUST SHUT UP.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.967
- I TRIED TO MAKE RAYMOND
SENSITIVE, DEBRA.

10:49.967 --> 10:51.833
- MA, DON'T YOU START, OKAY?

10:51.833 --> 10:55.200
- I TOOK YOU TO MUSEUMS,
AND I GAVE YOU PIANO LESSONS.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.667
AND I EVEN HAD HIS HAIR CUT
AT MY BEAUTY PARLOR,

10:58.667 --> 11:01.167
BUT THERE'S STILL SOME
OF HIS FATHER IN HIM.

11:01.167 --> 11:04.367
- HE GOT THE MORON GENE.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.333
- WELL,
I'M GOING TO STOP IT

11:08.333 --> 11:09.900
BEFORE IT GETS
TO MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.533
- YOU SEE? THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:11.533 --> 11:13.033
WHO SAYS THAT YOU
GET TO MAKE

11:13.033 --> 11:14.400
ALL THE DECISIONS
IN THIS HOUSE, HUH?

11:14.400 --> 11:16.500
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE MY BOYS TOO, ALL RIGHT?

11:16.500 --> 11:17.700
WHY DON'T YOU WORRY
A LITTLE BIT MORE

11:17.700 --> 11:18.767
ABOUT THE GIRL?

11:18.767 --> 11:22.567
- ALLY.
- I KNOW HER NAME!

11:22.567 --> 11:23.567
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:23.567 --> 11:25.133
AS FAR AS THE BOYS
ARE CONCERNED,

11:25.133 --> 11:27.233
MAYBE THERE'S SUCH A THING
AS TOO LIBERAL,

11:27.233 --> 11:29.667
MISS HIPPIE GO FREE-FREE.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.400
MICHAEL, GEOFFREY,
COME ON DOWN HERE.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.367
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:45.367 --> 11:46.533
- DON'T--DON'T YOU WORRY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:46.533 --> 11:48.500
- BAH-BAH, BAH-BAH, BAH.
I GOT IT.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.767
GUYS, COME HERE.

11:49.767 --> 11:52.767
LISTEN, DADDY PULLED
A FEW STRINGS HERE,

11:52.767 --> 11:54.933
AND HE GOT YOU BETTER PARTS
IN THE PLAY.

11:54.933 --> 11:57.100
OKAY?
ALL RIGHT?

11:57.100 --> 11:59.733
NOW, HERE ARE
YOUR NEW COSTUMES.

12:09.933 --> 12:13.567
- THEY'RE ROCKS?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.433
- NO, BOULDERS!

12:15.433 --> 12:17.367
THESE ARE GREAT PARTS,
GUYS, HUH?

12:17.367 --> 12:18.733
BEST PARTS
IN THE WHOLE PLAY.

12:18.733 --> 12:21.000
THE MIGHTY BOULDERS!

12:21.000 --> 12:23.400
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL THEM
THAT THEY COULD BE BOULDERS.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.833
- SO WHAT DO THEY DO?

12:24.833 --> 12:28.633
- THEY--THEY GUARD
THE ENTRANCE TO THE CASTLE.

12:28.633 --> 12:29.933
- DO THEY HAVE LINES?

12:29.933 --> 12:31.533
- NO, BUT HERE'S
THE THING, GUYS.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.233
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW THE PART
WHERE THE PRINCE COMES HOME,

12:34.233 --> 12:36.400
WEARY FROM HIS LONG JOURNEY?

12:36.400 --> 12:37.800
WELL, HE'S GOING TO COME OVER.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.633
HE'S GOING TO REST
ON ONE OF YOU GUYS.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.300
AND THEN WHILE HE'S RESTING
ON ONE OF YOU GUYS,

12:41.300 --> 12:43.633
HE PUTS HIS KNAPSACK
RIGHT ON THE OTHER GUY,

12:43.633 --> 12:48.067
AND IT'S A HEAVY KNAPSACK,
BUT YOU ARE A BOULDER!

12:49.833 --> 12:52.067
- SO THEY JUST SIT THERE?

12:52.067 --> 12:55.100
- ONLY FOR THE WHOLE PLAY.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.633
IT'S A GOOD PART; IT'S GREAT,
AND THEY'RE PERFECT FOR IT.

12:57.633 --> 12:58.967
COME ON,
LET'S TRY THEM ON, GUYS.

12:58.967 --> 13:00.800
SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.167
OKAY.
SIT, SIT.

13:07.967 --> 13:12.833
AW, YOU LOOK AWESOME!

13:12.833 --> 13:14.333
I'M PROUD OF YOU GUYS.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.467
- RAY,
YOU MADE THEM SCENERY.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.567
- HOW YOU GUYS DOING
IN THERE?

13:26.567 --> 13:27.600
- I'M SCARED!

13:27.600 --> 13:29.133
- ME TOO.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.733
- OKAY, COME ON.
COME ON.

13:30.733 --> 13:34.500
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY,
ALL RIGHT?

13:34.500 --> 13:36.567
MAYBE WE'LL, UH, POKE
A FEW HOLES IN THERE

13:36.567 --> 13:40.100
FOR LIGHT AND AIR.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.600
- DADDY,
CAN I PUT MY WINGS ON?

13:42.600 --> 13:44.167
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
DADDY'S GOT TO BRING

13:44.167 --> 13:46.167
THE WINGS BACK TO SCHOOL NOW.

13:46.167 --> 13:49.633
- I LIKE MY WINGS.
- ME TOO.

13:49.633 --> 13:52.467
- BUT ROCKS
DON'T HAVE WINGS.

13:52.467 --> 13:53.533
HUH?

13:53.533 --> 13:56.367
AND IF YOU'RE A ROCK,
YOU GET--

13:56.367 --> 13:58.933
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
SMOOTH AND COOL,

13:58.933 --> 14:00.700
WHICH WILL COME
IN REAL HANDY LATER

14:00.700 --> 14:03.567
WITH THE LADIES.

14:03.567 --> 14:07.333
YOU'RE SMOOTH.
YOU'RE COOL.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.800
- I WANT TO BE
A FAIRY.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.467
- ME TOO.

14:10.467 --> 14:11.967
- WELL, LISTEN,

14:11.967 --> 14:14.233
MAYBE MISS SARAH
WILL LET YOU HAVE CANDY

14:14.233 --> 14:15.300
UNDER THERE.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.267
- RAY, TAKE THEM BACK.

14:17.267 --> 14:19.433
- HOW WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE
A PUPPY UNDER THERE?

14:19.433 --> 14:21.367
- RAY.
- ALL RIGHT!

14:27.033 --> 14:28.567
MISS SARAH.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.867
- OH, HI, MR. BARONE.
DID YOU BRING THE WINGS BACK?

14:30.867 --> 14:32.333
- YEAH.
- I NEED THE WINGS.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.733
- WELL, UM,
HERE'S THE THING.

14:34.733 --> 14:37.900
THE ROCK IDEA
REALLY DIDN'T FLY.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.067
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID

14:39.067 --> 14:41.500
YOUR BOYS DREAMED
OF BEING ROCKS.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.400
- AH, KIDS
AND THEIR DREAMS,

14:44.400 --> 14:46.567
BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT WOULD BE OKAY

14:46.567 --> 14:48.533
IF THEY JUST WENT BACK
TO BEING FAIRIES.

14:48.533 --> 14:49.967
- OH, ACTUALLY,
I'VE ALREADY GOT

14:49.967 --> 14:50.967
TWO NEW FAIRIES.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.233
I'M SORRY.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.933
- OH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:53.933 --> 14:56.567
HOW ABOUT--YOU COULD HAVE
FOUR FAIRIES, YOU KNOW?

14:56.567 --> 14:58.767
TWO OVER THERE,
A COUPLE MORE OVER THERE.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.767
FOR MY MONEY, YOU CAN NEVER
HAVE TOO MANY FAIRIES.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.300
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.367
MAYBE YOUR BOYS WOULD LIKE
TO WORK BEHIND THE SCENES.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.367
THEY COULD HELP JOSH
WITH THE TAPE RECORDER.

15:06.367 --> 15:07.867
- UH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THE THING IS,

15:07.867 --> 15:10.967
THEY--THEY ACTUALLY
KIND OF WANT TO BE FAIRIES.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.233
- WELL,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

15:12.233 --> 15:14.633
I'M NOT SO SURE
MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY

15:14.633 --> 15:17.333
ARE QUITE CUT OUT
TO BE FAIRIES.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.500
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:19.500 --> 15:20.900
- WELL, THEY WERE HAVING
SOME PROBLEMS

15:20.900 --> 15:23.067
FOLLOWING
THE CHOREOGRAPHY.

15:23.067 --> 15:26.200
- REALLY? THEY LOOKED GOOD
FROM WHAT I SAW.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.633
- ACTUALLY, THEY--
NO.

15:28.633 --> 15:30.100
[clears throat]

15:30.100 --> 15:32.367
THEY JUST
KIND OF RUN AROUND,

15:32.367 --> 15:35.300
AND I CAN'T SEEM TO GET THEM
TO FOLLOW THE MUSIC.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.567
- WELL, MAYBE THEY JUST NEED

15:36.567 --> 15:38.200
A LITTLE MORE PRACTICE,
THAT'S ALL.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.733
- WELL, WE'VE BEEN REHEARSING
FOR A WEEK.

15:39.733 --> 15:42.667
THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO HAVE
THE PROPER COORDINATION.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.133
I'M SORRY.

15:44.133 --> 15:45.500
OH, OKAY, LET'S SEE
THE FIRST LIGHT CUE

15:45.500 --> 15:47.033
FOR THE PRINCE'S ENTRANCE.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.600
- WAIT,
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

15:48.600 --> 15:50.267
'CAUSE MY BOYS,
THEY'RE COORDINATED.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.133
YOU KNOW, I PLAY BALL WITH THEM.
YOU SHOULD SEE THEM.

15:52.133 --> 15:53.833
THEY RUN, THEY CATCH,
THEY HIT IT.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.600
- YEAH, I'M SURE
THEY'RE GREAT AT SPORTS,

15:55.600 --> 15:58.333
BUT THIS IS JUST
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.

15:59.467 --> 16:01.533
- WHAT, DANCING?

16:01.533 --> 16:04.233
NO, NO, NO, NO, COME ON.
THEY CAN DO THIS.

16:04.233 --> 16:06.233
FOUR FAIRIES, COME ON.
I SEE IT.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.667
I SEE IT
RIGHT THERE, HUH?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.400
IT MAKES THE SHOW.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.967
- WELL, I WANT TO BE FAIR
TO MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY,

16:12.967 --> 16:14.533
AND THE TWO NEW FAIRIES,

16:14.533 --> 16:17.133
WELL, THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE
LIGHTER ON THEIR FEET.

16:17.133 --> 16:18.667
- WELL, MY BOYS
ARE VERY LIGHT.

16:18.667 --> 16:23.500
THE DOORS AT THE A&P
DON'T EVEN OPEN FOR THEM.

16:24.800 --> 16:29.800
- BUT THE TWO NEW ONES
ARE REALLY QUITE GOOD.

16:29.800 --> 16:34.000
- SO IS THIS
THE SCHOOL SYSTEM NOW, HUH?

16:34.000 --> 16:37.467
WE--WE JUST SETTLE
FOR "QUITE GOOD"?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.200
- ALL RIGHT.
GUYS, YOU READY?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.433
both: YEAH.

16:50.433 --> 16:51.800
- OKAY.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.733

GOOD, GOOD ENERGY.

17:22.733 --> 17:25.533
LET'S TAKE IT DOWN
A NOTCH, ALL RIGHT?

17:25.533 --> 17:27.600
OKAY, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER,
FAIRIES, THEY'RE--

17:27.600 --> 17:30.333
THEY'RE HAPPY AND LIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

17:30.333 --> 17:33.400
NOT SO MUCH "AAH!"
NO, NO.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.067
THEY'RE NOT LIKE THAT,
OKAY?

17:35.067 --> 17:36.233
SO LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

17:36.233 --> 17:37.700
THIS TIME, STAY TOGETHER
AND JUST--

17:37.700 --> 17:40.733
REMEMBER, TRY TO BE--
BE GRACEFUL, OKAY?

17:40.733 --> 17:43.000
MAKE BELIEVE
YOU'RE FLYING, OKAY?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.467
HAPPY AND LIGHT.

17:44.467 --> 17:47.633
ALL RIGHT, RIGHT FROM THE TOP.
ALL RIGHT?

OKAY, GUYS, YOU READY?

IT'S GOING TO BE FUNNY

OF THE PLAY.

IS THAT GOING TO BE FUNNY?

18:39.467 --> 18:43.167
COME ON.

18:43.167 --> 18:44.867
I'VE SEEN
THE OTHER FAIRIES, GUYS.

18:44.867 --> 18:47.533
THEY PUT YOU AWAY,
ALL RIGHT?

18:51.467 --> 18:52.500
NOW YOU GOT TO--

18:52.500 --> 18:54.300
YOU GOT TO KNOW
THE MOVES.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.300
OTHERWISE, WHAT?
I'M NOT GOING TO TAPE IT.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.467
I'M NOT GOING
TO VIDEOTAPE IT IF YOU'RE...

I WANT YOU GUYS TO BE
THE BEST FAIRIES, ALL RIGHT?

19:01.167 --> 19:02.900
SO HERE'S WHAT
I WANT YOU TO DO,

19:02.900 --> 19:04.667
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GET BY ON YOUR LOOKS, ALL RIGHT?

IT'S NOT, "OH, LOOK
AT THE TWINS WITH BLOND HAIR."

19:06.367 --> 19:09.667
THAT DOESN'T CUT IT ANYMORE,
ALL RIGHT?

19:09.667 --> 19:10.800
SO LISTEN, INSTEAD OF--

19:10.800 --> 19:13.067
INSTEAD OF HOLDING
YOUR ARMS OUT STRAIGHT,

19:13.067 --> 19:14.867
TRY FLAPPING THEM.

19:14.867 --> 19:15.933
FLAP THEM.
YEAH.

19:15.933 --> 19:17.400
OKAY, NOT SO HARD, THOUGH.

NOT SO HARD, THOUGH,
OKAY?

19:20.767 --> 19:21.800
YEAH.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.867
SEE?
THAT'S IT.

19:23.867 --> 19:27.333
THIS IS HOW YOU FLY.
IT'S HOW YOU FLOAT.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.500
FEEL THE AIR.
THE AIR'S UNDER YOUR WINGS.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.733
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.933
NOW, INSTEAD OF RUNNING,
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS SKIP?

19:33.933 --> 19:35.900
TRY TO SKIP.
GOOD.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.067
TRY TO SKIP.
THAT'S GOOD.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.167
GOOD, BUT LIGHTLY.

LIGHTLY, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, GLIDE.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.233
GOOD.
ALL RIGHT.

NOW LET'S TRY IT
ON OUR TOES, ON OUR--

19:47.500 --> 19:50.133
OUR TIPPY TOES,
THE TIPPY TOES.

19:50.133 --> 19:51.300
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.733
FEEL IT.
YOU'RE FLYING.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.033
YEAH, YOU'RE FLYING.

19:54.033 --> 19:55.367
LOOK, I'M FLYING.
I'M FLYING.

19:55.367 --> 19:57.233
I'M FLYING.
I'M FLYING.

19:57.233 --> 19:59.433
I'M FLYING.
I'M--

20:08.767 --> 20:11.100
- HOLY CRAP.

20:23.167 --> 20:25.733
MARIE,
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY!

20:32.267 --> 20:35.900
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
NO PRESSURE, OKAY?

20:35.900 --> 20:37.000
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.300
MICHAEL, WHERE'S YOUR WAND?

20:38.300 --> 20:39.633
MICHAEL, WHAT'D YOU DO
WITH YOUR WAND?

20:39.633 --> 20:40.933
- YOU HAVE IT, DADDY.

20:40.933 --> 20:44.400
- OH, OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
OKAY, HERE.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.733
- RAWR!

20:45.733 --> 20:51.700
- HEY, DO YOU MIND?
WE'RE ON IN A MINUTE HERE.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.467
- MR. BARONE, UH,
WOULDN'T YOU BE MORE COMFORTABLE

20:54.467 --> 20:56.633
SITTING OUT IN THE AUDIENCE
WITH THE REST OF THE PARENTS?

20:56.633 --> 20:58.633
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOOD--I'M GOOD RIGHT HERE.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.767
- OKAY.
WELL, LET'S GO, EVERYBODY.

21:00.767 --> 21:01.967
OKAY,
GOOD LUCK, BOYS.

21:01.967 --> 21:03.233
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
THIS IS IT.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.700
YOU'RE ON, OKAY?
COME ON, PLACES NOW.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.800
HEY, NOW, DON'T FORGET
THE TWIRLY FINISH.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.800
- CURTAIN UP.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.800
[applause]

21:11.800 --> 21:13.900
ONCE UPON A TIME,

21:13.900 --> 21:16.300
THERE WAS A PRINCE
WHO WAS LOST IN THE FOREST.

21:16.300 --> 21:18.500
JUST AS THE PRINCE
HAD GIVEN UP HOPE

21:18.500 --> 21:20.800
AND THOUGHT HE WAS LOST
IN THE FOREST FOREVER,

21:20.800 --> 21:23.000
HE HEARD
A RUSTLING IN THE TREES.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.733
IT WAS THE MAGICAL FAIRIES.

21:26.733 --> 21:32.667
[Geoffrey and Michael screaming]

21:44.833 --> 21:46.267
- OH!
