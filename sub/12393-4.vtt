*

00:03.870 --> 00:06.839
[church bell tolls]

00:12.180 --> 00:14.273
- UH, THANKS
FOR COMING IN, HENRY.

00:14.310 --> 00:16.107
- OH, OF COURSE, FATHER.
OF COURSE.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.879
- I JUST WANTED TO DISCUSS

00:17.910 --> 00:19.639
SHAWN'S ATTITUDE
IN SUNDAY SCHOOL LATELY.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.341
IT SEEMS LIKE I CAN'T
GET THROUGH A LECTURE

00:21.380 --> 00:22.916
WITHOUT HIM QUESTIONING
EVERY DETAIL.

00:22.950 --> 00:26.408
TAKE THIS MORNING'S,
FOR INSTANCE, ON NOAH'S ARK.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.712
- I'M SORRY, DAD.
BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.557
- WHAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,
SHAWN?

00:30.590 --> 00:32.649
- [sighs]
LOTS OF THINGS.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.422
LIKE IF THE ARK WAS BUILT
IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

00:36.470 --> 00:39.166
HOW DID ANIMALS LIKE
THE KOALA BEAR GET TO IT?

00:39.200 --> 00:41.589
- GOD HELPED THEM GET THERE
USING HIS ALMIGHTY POWER.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.505
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, GUS.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.838
- THEN WHY DIDN'T HE USE
THOSE POWERS TO CREATE THE ARK?

00:45.870 --> 00:48.998
WOULDN'T THAT BE MUCH FASTER
THAN GETTING NOAH TO BUILD IT?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.041
- NO, SHAWN.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.378
BECAUSE GOD PREFERS
HIS CREATIONS

00:52.420 --> 00:53.739
ACCOMPLISH THINGS
ON THEIR OWN.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.817
- UNLESS THOSE CREATIONS HAPPEN
TO BE KOALA BEARS, RIGHT?

00:56.850 --> 00:58.249
- SHAWN, I THINK
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE

00:58.290 --> 00:59.359
TOO HUNG UP
ON THE DETAILS.

00:59.390 --> 01:00.880
- AH.
- REALLY?

01:00.920 --> 01:03.320
YOU'VE ALWAYS TAUGHT ME THAT
DETAILS ARE EVERYTHING IN LIFE.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.782
- YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT, SON.

01:04.830 --> 01:07.048
- HOW'D THEY KEEP ALL THE LIONS
FROM EATING ALL THE ZEBRAS?

01:07.100 --> 01:09.056
DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE SEVEN
LIONS WOULD HAVE GONE

01:09.100 --> 01:11.660
THROUGH AT LEAST SEVEN
ZEBRAS BY THEN?

01:14.770 --> 01:16.203
- [sighs]

01:16.240 --> 01:19.676
- THEY--THEY COULD HAVE EASILY
EATEN SEVEN ZEBRAS BY THEN.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.905
LIONS EAT CLOSE
TO 5,000 POUNDS OF MEAT A YEAR.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.601
- AH.

01:23.650 --> 01:26.073
- WHY DON'T WE BREAK THIS DOWN?
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

01:26.120 --> 01:29.214
WE'VE GOT NOAH, WE GOT
A BOATLOAD FULL OF ANIMALS.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.444
WHAT WOULD BE HIS M.O.?

01:30.490 --> 01:32.219
- THIS IS
NOT A DETECTIVE CASE, HENRY.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.148
THIS IS--

01:34.190 --> 01:35.350
HAVE YOU TWO EVER CONSIDERED

01:35.390 --> 01:37.187
VISITING THE METHODIST CHURCH
DOWN THE STREET?

01:37.230 --> 01:38.481
IT'S QUITE NICE.

01:51.010 --> 01:55.606
[labored breathing]

02:01.420 --> 02:03.411
- AGATHA!

02:14.730 --> 02:16.459
AGATHA, WAIT!
- GET AWAY!

02:16.500 --> 02:18.229
GET--STAY, STAY BACK!

02:19.540 --> 02:22.407
NO, DON'T COME
ANY CLOSER TO ME.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.203
STAY BACK.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.902
[cries]

02:26.940 --> 02:28.032
- AGATHA, COME DOWN.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.945
I WANNA HELP YOU.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.948
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, AGATHA.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.782
AGATHA!

02:44.990 --> 02:47.550
[cries]

02:59.710 --> 03:02.770
[church bell tolls]

03:11.820 --> 03:14.812
[camera clicks]

03:24.630 --> 03:26.268
- HOW COME YOU'RE SO QUIET?

03:26.300 --> 03:27.597
- 'CAUSE I'M MAD AT YOU.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.198
- WHAT? HOW COME?

03:29.240 --> 03:30.764
- HOW COME? REALLY?

03:32.710 --> 03:33.836
RING, RING.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.871
"HEY, GUS, YOU WANNA
GO TO THE BEACH TODAY?"

03:35.910 --> 03:37.844
"AH, ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANNA CHECK OUT

03:37.880 --> 03:39.848
THAT JUMPER
OVER AT SAINT ATTALUS?"

03:39.880 --> 03:42.212
"NAW, IT SOUNDS LIKE A
STRAIGHTFORWARD SUICIDE TO ME.

03:42.250 --> 03:43.342
ARE YOU PEEING?"

03:43.390 --> 03:45.085
"NO, SHAWN,
I'M DOING THE DISHES."

03:45.120 --> 03:46.883
"OH, SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE PEEING, EXCUSE ME."

03:46.920 --> 03:48.114
- THE NOZZLE WAS ON SPRAY MODE.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.525
AND SHAWN,
I DO NOT TALK LIKE THAT.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.152
- "SHAWN, MAYBE
WE SHOULD STOP BY

03:51.190 --> 03:52.851
"SAINT ATTALUS
JUST TO BE SURE.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.595
BESIDES, THERE'LL
BE ALL KINDS OF HOTTIES

03:54.630 --> 03:56.689
RUNNING AROUND IN CATHOLIC
SCHOOL GIRL UNIFORMS."

03:56.730 --> 03:58.027
WHAT?

03:58.070 --> 03:59.537
QUESTION...

03:59.570 --> 04:01.037
WHERE ARE ALL THE GIRLS

04:01.070 --> 04:02.935
IN THE CATHOLIC
SCHOOL GIRL UNIFORMS, GUS?

04:02.970 --> 04:04.164
- THERE'S ONE RIGHT OVER THERE.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.632
- NO, THAT IS A MALE BAGPIPER.

04:05.670 --> 04:07.069
WHY IS THIS CASE
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

04:07.110 --> 04:08.475
- IT HAPPENS
TO BE INTRIGUING TO ME.

04:08.510 --> 04:11.547
BESIDES, I'M HERE
TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND.

04:11.580 --> 04:14.777
- BURTON GUSTER,
YOU RANDY LITTLE SPANIEL.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.913
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY SO?

04:16.950 --> 04:18.440
DUDE, YOU KNOW
I LOVE PLAYING WINGMAN.

04:18.490 --> 04:19.650
JUST POINT HER OUT,

04:19.690 --> 04:20.987
WE'LL GET
THIS PARTY STARTED...

04:21.020 --> 04:22.089
* TONIGHT

04:27.160 --> 04:28.422
FATHER WESTLEY?

04:28.460 --> 04:30.360
- HELLO, GUS.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.630
- SCRATCH THE WINGMAN THING,
MAN, I'M OUT.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.865
- THANKS FOR COMING.
- OH, OF COURSE.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.197
- BEEN A LONG TIME.
- YES, IT HAS.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.504
YOU REMEMBER SHAWN SPENCER,
DON'T YOU?

04:38.540 --> 04:41.008
- HOW COULD I FORGET?
HE'S MY FAVORITE LITTLE SKEPTIC.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.200
- THAT'S WHY MY FRIENDS
CALL ME "SKEPTY".

04:42.240 --> 04:43.639
- NO THEY DON'T.
- THEY WILL.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.898
- I WAS SO HAPPY TO HEAR WHEN
YOU MOVED BACK TO SANTA BARBARA.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.178
- WELL, YOU AND I BOTH.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.972
YOU KNOW, I WAS RIGHT
IN THE MIDST OF SHOVELING

04:49.020 --> 04:51.079
FIVE INCHES OF SNOW
OFF MY DRIVEWAY IN BUFFALO.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.850
WHEN I GOT THE CALL
OFFERING ME THE POSITION HERE.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.548
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THE TWO
OF YOU HAVE BECOME DETECT IVES.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.251
- PSYCHIC DETECT IVES
TO BE EXACT.

04:59.290 --> 05:02.088
- ACTUALLY, HE'S THE PSYCHIC,
I'M A PHARMACEUTICAL SALESMAN.

05:02.130 --> 05:03.927
- WE ALSO DO COMMERCIAL JINGLES.
- NO, WE DON'T.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.925
- WE WILL.

05:04.970 --> 05:08.565
* BOOM BOOM BOOM
MUFFINS *

05:10.440 --> 05:11.532
- THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

05:11.570 --> 05:12.776
- THANKS, I MADE IT UP JUST NOW.

05:12.810 --> 05:14.277
- NO, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE DETECTIVE THING.

05:14.310 --> 05:15.402
- THAT TOO.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.976
- OKAY, CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE TRAGEDY

05:17.010 --> 05:18.307
THAT OCCURRED HERE LAST NIGHT?

05:18.350 --> 05:19.874
- IF YOU TWO DON'T MIND,
WE'RE ASKING QUESTIONS.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.319
- IF ONE OF THEM IS,

05:21.350 --> 05:23.716
"DO THE FEMALE STUDENTS WEAR
CATHOLIC SCHOOL GIRL UNIFORMS?"

05:23.750 --> 05:25.843
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO.
- STAY.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.619
FATHER.

05:28.690 --> 05:30.419
- WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE DECEASED?

05:30.460 --> 05:32.451
- AGATHA WAS A MODEL STUDENT.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.718
HARD-WORKING,
WELL-LIKED, OUTGOING.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.762
THEN ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO
SOMETHING CHANGED.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.894
SHE BECAME EXTREMELY SHORT
TEMPERED, EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE.

05:39.940 --> 05:40.929
ALMOST MANIC.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.631
NONE OF US KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.501
THERE WAS NO HISTORY
OF MENTAL ILLNESS

05:44.540 --> 05:46.974
AND HER FRIENDS SAY SHE NEVER
TOUCHED DRUGS OR ALCOHOL.

05:47.010 --> 05:49.171
- WAS SHE A FAN OF
THE GAME GRAND THEFT AUTO?

05:49.210 --> 05:51.349
I KNOW WHEN I PLAY,
I BECOME RAVING MAD,

05:51.380 --> 05:52.540
FOAMING AT THE MOUTH.

05:52.580 --> 05:53.740
- I HAD TO TASER HIM ONCE.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.543
- WHICH I STILL FEEL
WAS EXCESSIVE.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.719
- ST. ATTALUS
DOESN'T ALLOW VIDEO GAMES.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.184
- THEY DON'T ALLOW CATHOLIC
SCHOOL GIRL UNIFORMS, EITHER.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.687
- WILL YOU LET THAT GO?
- NO, I WILL NOT.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.654
- WILL YOU JUST STOP IT?

06:03.690 --> 06:04.918
EXCUSE US FOR A MOMENT.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.029
DETECTIVE...
- MM-HMM?

06:06.060 --> 06:07.391
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
- WHAT?

06:07.430 --> 06:09.990
- I THINK SHE WAS--
- YOU'RE WRONG.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.395
I'M SORRY,
I JUMPED THE GUN ON THAT.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.864
PLEASE CONTINUE.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.664
- I THINK SHE WAS MURDERED.
- ARE YOU FINISHED?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.109
- YES.
- YOU'RE WRONG.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.779
MY SENSES ARE TELLING ME THAT
THIS GIRL COMMITTED SUICIDE.

06:20.810 --> 06:23.677
- WELL YOU CAN TELL YOUR
SENSES TO KISS MY SWEET--

06:25.850 --> 06:29.445
LOVE BISCUITS.

06:31.150 --> 06:33.050
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU MADE
THAT ANY LESS OFFENSIVE.

06:33.090 --> 06:35.456
- LOOK, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT
THERE'S SOMETHING WEIRD HERE.

06:35.490 --> 06:37.355
I MEAN, A GIRL LIKE AGATHA
DOESN'T JUST RANDOMLY

06:38.490 --> 06:39.718
THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPLANATION.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.820
- I HAVE ONE.
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME, PETER.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.019
- NO, NO.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.368
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE
TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

06:50.170 --> 06:52.479
- SHE WAS POSSESSED.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.077
- I GUESS
MY VIDEO GAME THEORY

07:01.120 --> 07:03.441
ISN'T LOOKING
SO STUPID RIGHT NOW.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.387
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

07:08.420 --> 07:09.409
*

07:09.460 --> 07:11.121
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:11.160 --> 07:12.923
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

07:12.960 --> 07:14.518
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:14.560 --> 07:16.357
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

07:16.400 --> 07:17.697
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

07:17.730 --> 07:19.322
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

07:19.370 --> 07:21.190
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

07:21.240 --> 07:23.538
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

07:23.570 --> 07:26.573
*

07:34.120 --> 07:35.348
- SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.018
YOU THINK
THAT SHE WAS POSSESSED?

07:37.050 --> 07:39.041
AS IN FLOATING ABOVE THE BED,
HEAD SPINNING,

07:39.090 --> 07:40.614
PUKES UP ON THE WALL,
THAT SORT OF THING?

07:40.660 --> 07:42.651
- THAT'S THE HOLLYWOOD VERSION.

07:42.690 --> 07:44.282
THE REAL LIFE
SIGNS OF POSSESSION

07:44.330 --> 07:46.059
ARE OFTEN
MORE SUBTLE THAN THAT.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.557
- THOUGH THERE
HAVE BEEN SOME REPORTS

07:47.600 --> 07:49.591
OF LEVITATION IN EXORCISMS.
- THAT'S TRUE.

07:49.630 --> 07:51.222
- YOU'LL HAVE
TO FORGIVE FATHER WESTLEY,

07:51.270 --> 07:52.794
HE COMES FROM
AN ERA OF THE CHURCH

07:52.840 --> 07:54.899
WHERE SUCH BELIEFS
WERE MORE WIDELY ACCEPTED.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.408
TODAY THE MAJORITY OF US
VIEW THE CONCEPT

07:57.440 --> 08:00.500
OF DEMONIC POSSESSION TO BE
A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.303
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

08:02.340 --> 08:05.343
FATHER,
YOU SHOULD COME AS WELL.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.473
- I'M SPEAKING THE TRUTH, GUS.
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.647
I DON'T ARRIVE AT SUCH
CONCLUSIONS EASILY.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.419
- FATHER WESTLEY.
- YES.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.315
[phone rings]

08:13.360 --> 08:15.783
- LASSITER.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.356
- YOU HAVE A LITTLE SHIVER
OVER THERE, JULES?

08:17.390 --> 08:19.483
- NO, IT'S ALL THIS
TALK OF DEVIL AND POSSESSION.

08:19.530 --> 08:20.599
I DON'T SCARE EASILY,

08:20.630 --> 08:22.222
BUT THAT STUFF MAKES ME
SHAKE IN MY BOOTS.

08:22.260 --> 08:23.761
- I'M TALKING TO VICK,
SHE WANTS TO KNOW

08:23.800 --> 08:25.097
IF YOU TWO DOPES
ARE ON THE CASE.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.291
- WELL, LASSIE, MY FRIEND,
I'M AFRAID THE ANSWER

08:27.340 --> 08:29.331
IS A BIG FAT--
- YES.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.668
- AND BY YES, HE MEANS--
- ABSOLUTELY.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.029
- MAY I SPEAK
WITH YOU

08:33.080 --> 08:34.832
IN THE "STOP OPENLY
CONTRADICTING ME" ROOM, PLEASE?

08:34.880 --> 08:37.041
- YOU CAN TELL HER
WE'LL TAKE IT.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.399
WHAT?

08:38.450 --> 08:39.542
- SINCE WHEN
DO YOU ACCEPT A CASE

08:39.580 --> 08:40.877
WITHOUT RUNNING IT
BY YOUR PARTNER?

08:40.920 --> 08:43.184
- YOU DO IT EVERY WEEK.
- OH, SO THAT MAKES IT RIGHT?

08:44.920 --> 08:47.184
- SHAWN, I KNOW
WHO KILLED THAT GIRL.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.653
- WHO?

08:48.690 --> 08:50.783
- [whispers]
THE DEVIL.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.949
- SO, I'VE BEEN THINKING...

08:55.000 --> 08:56.319
IF WE END UP CATCHING
THE DEVIL,

08:56.360 --> 08:58.419
AND HE STARTS
ACTING ALL DEVILY,

08:58.470 --> 08:59.937
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.369
FIRST, I'LL BUY A FIDDLE,

09:01.400 --> 09:03.664
PLAY A QUICK TUNE SO
HE UNDERESTIMATES MY ABILITY,

09:03.710 --> 09:05.735
AND THEN I'LL CHALLENGE
HIM TO A WAGER--

09:05.770 --> 09:07.271
HE WINS,
HE GETS MY SOUL.

09:07.310 --> 09:08.868
I WIN, WE GET
HIS COOPERATION.

09:08.910 --> 09:09.979
- ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

09:10.010 --> 09:11.375
YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN POSSESSIONS.

09:11.410 --> 09:12.843
- OH, BUT I DO.

09:12.880 --> 09:17.419
ESPECIALLY AFTER I SAW THIS
POLICE SKETCH OF THE SUSPECT.

09:17.450 --> 09:19.884
LAST SEEN AT THE LOCAL
CANNED HAM FACTORY.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.911
- HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU
TO DRAW THAT?

09:21.960 --> 09:24.178
- A GOOD HALF HOUR, BUT
I THINK IT SOLD MY POINT.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.119
- LOOK, I KNOW FATHER WESTLEY'S
THEORY IS KIND OF CRAZY.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.321
BUT IF HE BELIEVES IT, THEN
I NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.896
YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOOK UP TO HIM.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.363
- I LOOK UP TO BRETT FAVRE.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.436
IT DOESN'T MEAN I BELIEVE
EVERYTHING HE SAYS.

09:34.470 --> 09:35.892
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.737
IT'S THOSE TEARFUL
PRESS CONFERENCES, MAN.

09:37.770 --> 09:38.964
THEY GET ME EVERY TIME.

09:39.010 --> 09:40.602
- LOOK, I JUST WANNA
AT LEAST LOOK INTO IT.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.528
- BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN HAVE
YOUR BACK ON THIS, GUS.

09:42.580 --> 09:44.639
- I KNOW, THAT'S WHY I WANNA
BE THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR.

09:44.680 --> 09:45.874
- SINCE WHEN
DO WE HAVE TITLES?

09:45.910 --> 09:47.639
- SINCE YOU ORDERED
BUSINESS CARDS THAT SAY,

09:47.680 --> 09:49.443
"SHAWN SPENCER,
LEAD INVESTIGATOR."

09:49.480 --> 09:50.708
- NO, SILLY.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.718
IT'S "LEAD--
LEAD INVESTIGATORS."

09:52.760 --> 09:54.250
A BUSINESS I WAS THINKING
OF STARTING

09:54.290 --> 09:55.780
AFTER WE WATCHED
ERIN BROCKOVICH.

09:55.820 --> 09:57.549
- SHAWN.
- OKAY...FINE.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.285
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE THE LEAD.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.627
- THANK YOU.
- I'M IN THE BACK SEAT.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.252
- THANK YOU.

10:02.300 --> 10:03.324
[knocking]

10:03.370 --> 10:04.894
- YEAH, COME IN.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.034
AH!

10:08.070 --> 10:09.094
COME ON IN, BOYS.

10:09.140 --> 10:10.402
[laughing]

10:10.440 --> 10:15.639
HEY...LET ME GET
ANOTHER LOOK AT
YOU TWO, HUH?

10:15.680 --> 10:16.999
YOU TWO HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.740
[laughing]
HAVE A SEAT, BOYS.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.419
YOU KNOW, I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE FOR EARLIER ON.

10:24.450 --> 10:25.678
YOU KNOW, FATHER BARD,

10:25.720 --> 10:27.779
LIKE A LOT OF THE YOUNGER
MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH

10:27.820 --> 10:30.220
ISN'T VERY TOLERANT
TOWARDS VIEWS

10:30.260 --> 10:31.522
THAT HE DOESN'T AGREE WITH.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.357
- I ACTUALLY
WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.458
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT AGATHA

10:34.500 --> 10:35.819
THAT MADE YOU THINK
SHE WAS POSSESSED?

10:35.860 --> 10:38.693
- WELL, HER EXTREME CHANGE
OF PERSONALITY FOR ONE.

10:38.730 --> 10:41.699
AND THAT, COUPLED WITH
THE FACT THAT I LEARNED

10:41.740 --> 10:44.334
THAT SHE'D BEEN DABBLING
IN THE OCCULT.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.735
ACCORDING TO A FRIEND,
SHE HAD BEEN

10:45.770 --> 10:49.001
CONDUCTING SEANCES
AND USING OUIJA BOARDS.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.440
BOTH OF WHICH CAN
BE USED AS CALLING CARDS

10:51.480 --> 10:53.914
OF SORTS
FOR DEMONIC SPIRITS.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.247
- JUST FOR THE RECORD, FATHER,

10:55.280 --> 10:57.680
I USE OUIJA BOARDS
ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS A KID.

10:57.720 --> 11:01.679
AND NEVER ONCE
WAS I POS--AHH.

11:01.720 --> 11:05.087
YOU'RE GONNA DIE UP THERE.

11:05.130 --> 11:06.927
[laughs]

11:06.960 --> 11:09.155
COME ON, MAN,
IT'S A LINE FROM THE MOVIE.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.361
- IF YOU THOUGHT THAT AGATHA
WAS POSSESSED,

11:11.400 --> 11:13.197
WHY DIDN'T YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE
PERFORM AN EXORCISM?

11:13.240 --> 11:14.992
- BELIEVE ME, I TRIED.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.203
BUT I HAD TO GET
THE APPROVAL OF THE HEADMASTER

11:18.240 --> 11:20.606
WHO HAPPENS
TO BE FATHER BARD.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.074
AND HE SAID NO, OF COURSE.

11:24.010 --> 11:26.001
I THINK I COULD
HAVE PREVENTED HER DEATH.

11:26.050 --> 11:28.371
- THAT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY,
FATHER.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.978
BUT ISN'T IT POSSIBLE...
- BACK SEAT.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.215
- AGATHA WAS JUST
A VERY DISTURBED YOUNG GIRL?

11:32.250 --> 11:34.218
- [whispers] BACK SEAT.
- SHAWN, BELIEVE ME,

11:34.260 --> 11:36.751
I'VE DEALT WITH ENOUGH DISTURBED
PEOPLE TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

11:36.790 --> 11:40.089
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
MAY SEEM A BIT ILLOGICAL TO YOU,

11:40.130 --> 11:42.860
BUT TRUST ME,
POSSESSIONS ARE REAL.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.492
THEY'RE REAL.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.760
I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO IT.

11:58.050 --> 12:01.178
- * BOOM BOOM BOOM...
THIS THING *

12:01.220 --> 12:02.744
COME ON.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.213
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO BAIL ON THE POSSESSED THEORY,

12:05.250 --> 12:06.956
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY
HAVE A REAL IDEA

12:06.990 --> 12:08.389
FOR WHY AGATHA
WAS ACTING CRAZY.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.785
- THERE WILL BE
NO BAILING, SHAWN.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.287
I JUST FOUND THESE ARTICLES
ONLINE ABOUT FATHER WESTLEY.

12:12.330 --> 12:13.752
DID YOU KNOW HE'S ONE
OF THE FOREMOST EXPERTS

12:13.800 --> 12:15.529
ON DEMONIC POSSESSION
IN THE UNITED STATES?

12:15.560 --> 12:18.768
HE PERFORMED A BUNCH OF HIGH
PROFILE EXORCISMS IN THE '705,

12:18.800 --> 12:21.360
INCLUDING THIS ONE IN PERU,
WHICH LASTED OVER A MONTH.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.368
I REMEMBER READING
ABOUT IT AS A KID.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.935
- IN WHAT? THIS NEVER
ACTUALLY HAPPENED MAGAZINE?

12:25.970 --> 12:28.803
- YOU MOCK,
BUT CHECK THIS OUT.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.569
BOOM.
AGATHA'S PAGE.

12:30.610 --> 12:32.669
- YOU FRIENDED
A DEAD PERSON.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.246
- NO, I FIGURED OUT HER PASSWORD
AND LOGGED ON.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.747
- OH, LET ME GUESS.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.884
UH, SHE'S KIND OF GOTHY,
SO IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING

12:37.920 --> 12:40.184
LIKE "BAUHAUS"
OR "SIOUXSIE" WITH AN "X."

12:40.220 --> 12:42.085
- HER BIRTHDAY.
- NO, THAT'S TOO OBVIOUS.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.189
"BJORK"?

12:43.230 --> 12:44.754
- THE PASSWORD
IS HER BIRTHDAY, SHAWN.

12:44.790 --> 12:46.587
- OH, GOOD ON YOU
FOR KNOWING BJORK'S BIRTHDAY.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.349
- HER OWN BIRTHDAY.
WILL YOU CHECK THIS OUT?

12:49.400 --> 12:51.459
LOOK AT HER STATUS UPDATES
FROM THREE WEEKS AGO.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.865
NOTICE HOW
THEY'RE ALL CHEERY?

12:52.900 --> 12:54.788
"AGATHA IS LOVING
SANTA BARBARA RIGHT NOW."

12:54.840 --> 12:56.239
"AGATHA JUST PLAYED
WITH THE CUTEST PUPPY."

12:56.270 --> 12:58.864
- I BET IT WAS A LABRADOODLE.
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

12:58.910 --> 13:01.299
LOOK HERE NOW, THE NEXT DAY,
THEY COMPLETELY CHANGE.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.103
"AGATHA IS OVER EVERYBODY!

13:03.150 --> 13:05.106
AGATHA JUST
WANTS TO BE LEFT ALONE."

13:05.150 --> 13:07.414
THAT IS WHEN
SHE BECAME POSSESSED.

13:07.450 --> 13:10.988
- OR...MAY I GO NOW?
- GO AHEAD.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.544
- OR, THAT IS PRECISELY
WHEN SHE STARTED

13:12.590 --> 13:14.319
HAVING MAN TROUBLE,
COME ON, GUS.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.588
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN?

13:15.620 --> 13:16.951
- [sighs] SHE WAS
WEARING A SWEATSHIRT

13:16.990 --> 13:18.423
THAT WAS AT LEAST
A DOUBLE XL.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.690
THAT MEANS SHE EITHER
SPENT A FEW HOURS IN ONE

13:20.730 --> 13:23.563
OF THOSE CARTOON STEAM BOXES
THAT SHRINKS YOU A FEW SIZES,

13:23.600 --> 13:25.420
OR IT BELONGED
TO HER BOYFRIEND.

13:25.470 --> 13:27.836
SO WHY DON'T WE CHECK
HER PHOTOS AND FIND OUT?

13:27.870 --> 13:29.167
- GO AHEAD.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.264
- MAN, HOW COME
EVERY GIRL POSTS, LIKE,

13:32.310 --> 13:34.005
A MILLION PHOTOS ONLINE
OF HER AND FRIENDS

13:34.040 --> 13:36.179
POSING CHEEK TO CHEEK?
IT'S SO LAME.

13:36.210 --> 13:39.043
- SAYS THE GUY
WHO HAS THAT ON HIS DESK.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.617
- IT'S NOT POSTED ONLINE, GUS.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.538
YET.

13:43.590 --> 13:47.014
BORING. BORING.
BOOM.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.358
I GIVE YOU
AGATHA'S BOYFRIEND.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.823
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SMOOCHIE?

13:50.860 --> 13:52.282
WELL, HELLO, CAMERON.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.628
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT
THEY WERE HAVING TROUBLE, SHAWN.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.548
- OH, REALLY?
[sighs]

13:56.600 --> 13:58.124
WEDNESDAY,
THE 5TH:

13:58.170 --> 14:00.331
"AGATHA IS PISSY
AT HER BOYFRIEND."

14:00.370 --> 14:03.498
THE 9TH: "AGATHA'S
TIRED OF ALL THE DRAMA."

14:03.540 --> 14:07.032
AND THE 14TH:
"AGATHA IS NOW SINGLE."

14:07.080 --> 14:09.139
- THAT LAST ONE WAS
TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.579
- I'LL GIVE YOU
TWO POSSIBLE SCENARIOS.

14:10.610 --> 14:12.077
ONE, CAMERON DUMPED AGATHA,

14:12.110 --> 14:13.941
AND SHE THREW HERSELF
OFF A BUILDING IN DESPAIR.

14:13.980 --> 14:16.676
OR TWO,
AGATHA DUMPED CAMERON,

14:16.720 --> 14:19.041
HE PUSHED HER OFF
THE BUILDING IN A FIT OF RAGE.

14:19.090 --> 14:21.251
BOTH OF WHICH
ARE FAR MORE PLAUSIBLE

14:21.290 --> 14:24.350
THAN THE DEVIL
GOING DOWN TO SANTA BARBARA.

14:24.390 --> 14:25.789
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:25.830 --> 14:27.991
- WE ARE GOING
TO TALK TO CAMERON.

14:28.030 --> 14:29.588
I'M GOING
TO CRACK THIS THING, GUS.

14:29.630 --> 14:32.565
BUT FIRST I'M GONNA NEED
MY LEAD INVESTIGATOR TITLE BACK.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.192
[squishing sounds]
THANK YOU.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.532
[knocking]

14:41.580 --> 14:42.831
- UH, WHAT WAS HER MAJOR?

14:42.880 --> 14:46.145
- IT'S CHRISTIAN STUDIES.
- CHRISTIAN STUDIES.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.579
- UNBELIEVABLE.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.838
LASSIE HAS NOW
BEATEN US TO A SUSPECT.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.586
I'M AFRAID HISTORY
WILL NOT LOOK TOO KINDLY

14:51.620 --> 14:54.009
ON YOUR TENURE
AS LEAD INVESTIGATOR.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.381
HEY, KIDS,
WHAT DID WE MISS?

14:56.420 --> 14:58.559
- THIS IS AGATHA'S
EX-BOYFRIEND.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.729
- LET ME GUESS.
YOUR NAME IS CAMERON.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.988
- THAT'S RIGHT.

15:02.030 --> 15:03.224
- YOU GUYS
BROKE UP TWO DAYS AGO.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.420
- WOW.
- AND YOU WEIGH A SOLID 225.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.734
- YOU'RE ABOUT
50 POUNDS OFF.

15:07.770 --> 15:09.169
- I GOT GREEDY.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.906
- GOSH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT THE BREAKUP.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.760
THOSE CAN BE TOUGH.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.335
LET ME GUESS, YOU DUMPED HER,
BUT SHE WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT?

15:15.380 --> 15:18.941
- NO, AGATHA WAS THE ONE
THAT BROKE UP WITH ME.

15:18.980 --> 15:21.540
I WAS WILLING
TO MAKE IT WORK.

15:21.580 --> 15:24.048
- WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT
WHEN SHE JUMPED?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.911
- I WAS IN THE DESERT
AT BURNING MAN.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.416
- I HOPE YOU
CAN PROVE THAT, BUDDY.

15:34.830 --> 15:37.560
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU GUYS GOT THIS ONE COVERED.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.568
GUS AND I ARE GOING
TO THROW BACK A COUPLE SHOTS

15:39.600 --> 15:42.137
AND HIT
THE CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.004
- THE DUDE'S ALIBI IS GOOD.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.735
THERE WAS A BACKPACK
AND SHOES IN THE CORNER

15:46.770 --> 15:48.306
COVERED IN SAND
FROM BURNING MAN.

15:48.340 --> 15:50.843
- EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU
THE GRIEF COUNSELORS?

15:50.880 --> 15:53.678
- YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT
WE ARE, MARY.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.745
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT WAS MY NAME?

15:55.780 --> 15:57.338
- JUST A HUNCH.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.687
- UM, HOW'S CAMERON DOING?

15:58.720 --> 16:00.153
WE'RE ALL REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

16:00.190 --> 16:02.078
- OH, IT'S TOUGH.
YOU KNOW, HE'S HANGING IN THERE.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.486
I THINK HE'LL FEEL MUCH BETTER
ONCE THE MEDICATION KICKS IN.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.919
- HE'S ON MEDICATION?
- NO, I AM.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.393
JUST AN ANTACID.
- [glggleSJ

16:08.430 --> 16:10.398
- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
YOU CAN THINK OF WHO'S TAKING

16:10.430 --> 16:12.728
THE NEWS OF AGATHA'S
DEATH PARTICULARLY HARD?

16:12.770 --> 16:15.159
FAMILY OR CLOSE FRIENDS?

16:17.210 --> 16:19.735
- WELL, YOU KNOW
ABOUT LUCY, DON'T YOU?

16:19.770 --> 16:20.805
- YES, OF COURSE.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.502
SHE CHARGES, WHAT,
FIVE CENTS FOR PSYCHIATRIC HELP.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.508
AND IF SHE EVER ASKS YOU
TO KICK A FOOTBALL, YOU SAY NO.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.040
- HE'S SAYING
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT LUCY.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.344
- SHE WAS ONE
OF AGATHA'S BEST FRIENDS.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.415
SHE SAW THE WHOLE THING.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.680
AGATHA DIED IN HER ARMS.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.711
- REALLY?

16:36.760 --> 16:39.058
YOU WOULDN'T
HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE

16:39.090 --> 16:41.627
WE COULD
FIND THIS LUCY, WOULD YOU?

16:58.280 --> 17:00.339
- YES?
- HELLO, MRS. RYAN.

17:00.380 --> 17:03.087
MY NAME IS SHAWN,
THIS IS SHAWN--NO RELATION--

17:03.120 --> 17:05.088
WE'RE GRIEF COUNSELORS
FROM THE SCHOOL.

17:05.120 --> 17:07.384
- OH, THANK GOD.
PLEASE COME IN.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.615
- SHAWN.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.829
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST ANOTHER PAIR OF DETECTIVES.

17:14.860 --> 17:17.192
- OH, THERE WERE DETECT IVES
HERE EARLIER?

17:17.230 --> 17:20.165
- YES, TWO BY THE NAME
O'HARA AND LASSITER.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.929
- DUDE, YOU'RE ON FIRE.

17:21.970 --> 17:24.962
- THEY DIDN'T GET MUCH.
LUCY WAS REALLY WITHDRAWN.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.604
YOU TWO COULDN'T
HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.108
IT'S LIKE SHE'S
A SHELL OF HER FORMER SELF.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.744
DO YOU THINK SHE HAS PTSD?

17:32.780 --> 17:34.645
- I'M AFRAID
THIS IS FAR MORE SERIOUS

17:34.680 --> 17:36.910
THAN A MERE MENSTRUAL ISSUE.

17:36.950 --> 17:40.078
- IT COULD BE
POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.418
BUT WE WON'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL
WE TALK WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

17:42.460 --> 17:43.757
- IN PRIVATE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

17:43.790 --> 17:46.156
- OF COURSE.
PLEASE, GO ON UP--

17:46.190 --> 17:49.899
HER ROOM IS THE FIRST LEFT
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS.

17:49.930 --> 17:51.227
CAN I GET
EITHER OF YOU SOMETHING?

17:51.270 --> 17:54.489
- YES, A DIET COKE,
SOME GARLIC HUMMUS,

17:54.540 --> 17:56.132
AND THE NEW TV GUIDE,
IF YOU HAVE IT.

18:31.570 --> 18:37.008
- MRS. RYAN, IS YOUR DAUGHTER
BY ANY CHANCE AN EXPERT YOGI?

18:37.040 --> 18:40.316
- OR AN OLYMPIC GYMNAST,
PERHAPS?

18:41.820 --> 18:43.139
- NO, WHY?

18:43.190 --> 18:46.182
- THERE'S NO
PARTICULAR REASON.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.320
HEY, LUCY.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.295
THAT WAS SOME PRETTY SWEET
SPIDER WALKING.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.497
WE WERE HOPING
YOU COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON

19:01.540 --> 19:03.235
ON WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.067
- DIE.

19:05.110 --> 19:08.739
- YES, WE HEARD YOU
LOST YOUR BEST FRIEND.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.668
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
WE'RE SO SORRY.

19:10.710 --> 19:13.042
- NO, BOTH OF YOU--
DIE.

19:14.850 --> 19:17.011
- DUDE, THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT GIRL.

19:17.050 --> 19:19.189
- SHE JUST SAW HER BEST FRIEND
KILL HERSELF, GUS.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.619
IMAGINE HOW YOU'D BE
IF YOU SAW ME

19:20.660 --> 19:22.787
TORN APART BY
A PRIDE OF ANGRY LIONS.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.583
WHICH REMINDS ME,
I'M HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS

19:24.630 --> 19:26.621
ABOUT OUR SPRING SAFARI TRIP.
- HEAR ME OUT.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.423
AGATHA JUMPED OFF THE BUILDING
TO KILL HERSELF

19:28.460 --> 19:29.893
AND THE DEMON
THAT WAS INSIDE OF HER.

19:29.930 --> 19:31.329
BUT RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED,

19:31.370 --> 19:33.668
THE DEMON TRANSFERRED
OUT OF HER AND INTO LUCY.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.167
JUST LIKE IN THE EXORCIST.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.667
- DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE BASING
THIS ON A FICTIONAL MOVIE?

19:36.700 --> 19:39.203
- YOU ONCE TRIED TO SOLVE A CASE
USING THE MOVIE PRETTY IN PINK.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.332
- THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,

19:40.380 --> 19:43.269
PRETTY IN PINK
IS MORE OF A DOCU-DRAMA.

19:43.310 --> 19:46.609
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
LET'S SAY SHE IS POSSESSED.

19:46.650 --> 19:48.242
HOW COME SHE ISN'T
PROJECTILE VOMITING

19:48.280 --> 19:50.316
AND SPOUTING STUFF
IN LANGUAGES SHE DOESN'T KNOW?

19:50.350 --> 19:52.739
- JEDEN TAG TRIFFST DU

19:52.790 --> 19:56.954
ENTSCHEIDUNGEN DIE DEIN LEBEN
VERANDERN KONNEN!

19:56.990 --> 19:59.982
- YOU MEAN LIKE THAT?

20:03.570 --> 20:07.995
- MRS. RYAN,
HOW MANY FOREIGN LANGUAGES

20:08.040 --> 20:09.393
DOES YOUR DAUGHTER SPEAK?

20:09.440 --> 20:10.634
- JUST FRENCH, WHY?

20:10.670 --> 20:13.230
- BOOM!
IN YOUR FUDGE.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.339
- SHE WAS SPEAKING GERMAN.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

20:15.380 --> 20:18.144
- I WENT TO_COLLEGE.
- [walling]

20:18.180 --> 20:20.512
- LUCY!
LUCY, PLEASE CALM DOWN.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.347
- JUST ADMIT IT,
THE ONLY REASON

20:22.380 --> 20:24.086
WHY YOU WON'T ACCEPT POSSESSION
AS A REAL POSSIBILITY

20:24.120 --> 20:25.917
IS BECAUSE
FATHER WESTLEY CAME UP WITH IT.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.258
YOU'VE ALWAYS
HAD A PROBLEM WITH HIM.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.053
- I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH FATHER WESTLEY.

20:29.090 --> 20:30.421
HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH ME.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.849
BECAUSE I HAVE THE ABILITY
TO SEE THINGS MORE THAN ONE WAY.

20:32.890 --> 20:34.255
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.052
YOU CLEARLY CAN'T SEE THINGS
OBJECT IVELY RIGHT NOW.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.568
THAT'S IT, I'M TAKING BACK
OVER AS LEAD INVESTIGATOR.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.792
[imitating machinery]
SORRY, BUDDY.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.501
ONLY ONE TITLE SWITCH
PER INVESTIGATION.

20:44.540 --> 20:47.031
IT'S IN THE FINE PRINT
ON THE BACK OF MY BUSINESS CARD.

20:49.010 --> 20:50.443
[chuckles]
COME ON, CHILL OUT, MAN.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.777
I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

20:51.810 --> 20:52.845
- DON'T PUNCH ME, SHAWN.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.972
- OW!

20:54.020 --> 20:56.170
THAT WAS WAY HARDER.
- WELL.

20:56.220 --> 20:57.346
- OH, YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

20:57.390 --> 20:58.687
- COME ON.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.119
- YOU WANNA DO THIS RIGHT NOW?
- COME ON.

21:00.150 --> 21:01.686
- COME ON, BABY GIRL.
- COME ON, COME ON.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.384
- EXCUSE ME!

21:05.430 --> 21:08.149
WHAT KIND OF GRIEF COUNSELORS
ARE YOU?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.361
- WE'RE VERY PROGRESSIVE.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.595
THIS IS AN EXERCISE
THAT WE DO.

21:12.630 --> 21:15.167
IT HELPS US EMPATHIZE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER'S PAIN.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.966
- RIGHT, WATCH.
- UGH.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.101
I'M NOW GOING
TO TURN THINGS OVER

21:24.150 --> 21:27.278
TO THE LEAD GRIEF COUNSELOR,
SHAWN.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.941
[whispering]
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

21:33.790 --> 21:38.056
[sports on television]

21:39.260 --> 21:41.694
- ALL RIGHT, WHERE'S IS IT?
WHERE IS MY XBOX?

21:41.730 --> 21:43.322
WHERE IS IT?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT

21:43.370 --> 21:45.326
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.895
- DAD, THIS IS NOT
THE DAY TO MESS WITH ME.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.339
I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT.

21:49.370 --> 21:50.860
AH-HA!

21:52.140 --> 21:54.005
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU STOLE IT FROM ME.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.632
- I PREFER
THE TERM "REPOSSESSED,"

21:55.680 --> 21:57.079
IN THAT YOU
RENEGED ON OUR DEAL.

21:57.110 --> 21:58.839
- I PAINTED YOUR HOUSE,
JUST LIKE WE AGREED.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.769
MINUS THE SPOTS BEHIND THE
BUSHES THAT NO ONE EVER SEES,

22:01.820 --> 22:04.209
AND THE WINDOWS,
AND OF COURSE, THE ENTIRE BACK.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.218
- THAT THING STAYS HERE
UNTIL YOU'RE FINISHED.

22:06.250 --> 22:07.410
END OF STORY.

22:10.360 --> 22:13.397
OH, LET ME GUESS.
RELATIONSHIP TROUBLE?

22:13.430 --> 22:16.490
- YEAH.
I HATE IT WHEN WE FIGHT.

22:16.530 --> 22:18.259
- I'M SURE SHE FEELS
THE SAME WAY.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.530
- I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT ABIGAIL, I MEAN GUS.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.868
- SO AM I.
- I WAS REALLY STARTING TO MAKE

22:22.900 --> 22:24.629
SOME PROGRESS ON
THIS CASE WE'RE WORKING ON,

22:24.670 --> 22:27.969
AND HE REFUSES TO LET GO OF THIS
RIDICULOUS THEORY THAT HE HAS.

22:28.010 --> 22:32.800
- SHAWN, DO YOU REMEMBER
MY EX-PARTNER, STEVIE?

22:32.850 --> 22:34.374
THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME WHEN
STEVIE WAS CONVINCED

22:34.420 --> 22:36.570
THAT A RASH OF BREAK-INS
WAS BEING COMMITTED BY

22:36.620 --> 22:38.417
AN APE WHO HAD ESCAPED
FROM THE LOCAL ZOO.

22:38.450 --> 22:40.816
NOW OF COURSE, I THOUGHT
HE HAD LOST HIS MIND.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.589
BUT I WENT DOWN
THE ROAD WITH HIM ON IT.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.929
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE
A GOOD MOVE, YOU KNOW WHY?

22:44.960 --> 22:46.279
- I DON'T KNOW.
HEADLINES?

22:46.330 --> 22:48.855
"COPS STOP MONKEY BUSINESS:
CRIMINALS GO BANANAS"?

22:48.900 --> 22:50.527
- I'M TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT HERE.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.424
THE POINT IS IT TURNED OUT
TO BE A GOOD MOVE

22:52.470 --> 22:54.563
BECAUSE FROM THAT POINT ON

22:54.600 --> 22:58.161
STEVIE ALWAYS
SUPPORTED MY IDEAS.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.428
YOU GET
YOUR PARTNER'S BACK, SHAWN.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.404
EVEN IF IT MEANS PUTTING
YOUR DOUBTS ASIDE FOR A MINUTE.

23:11.320 --> 23:14.312
[knocking]

23:15.720 --> 23:16.948
- [sighs]

23:16.990 --> 23:18.184
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.380
- I CAME BACK
TO HELP MY PARTNER.

23:20.430 --> 23:22.295
- THAN KS, BUDDY.

23:22.330 --> 23:24.867
BUT I ALREADY CALLED SOMEONE.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.720
- WHO?

23:27.970 --> 23:31.963
[The Exorcist Theme]

23:39.780 --> 23:41.668
- I APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING
AN OPEN MIND ABOUT THIS.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.017
- NO PROBLEM, BUDDY.

23:43.050 --> 23:44.517
NOW TELL ME IF, UH,

23:44.550 --> 23:46.279
THIS GIRL
TURNS OUT TO BE POSSESSED

23:46.320 --> 23:47.810
AND THE WHOLE
EXORCISM THING WORKS--

23:47.860 --> 23:49.987
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US,
AS FAR AS THE CASE GOES?

23:50.020 --> 23:52.454
- IT'S OVER, WE KNOW
WHY AGATHA KILLED HERSELF.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.328
- RIGHT.
NOW WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK--

23:57.360 --> 24:00.329
I'M SORRY,
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,

24:00.370 --> 24:03.237
WILL YOU PROMISE ME THAT WE CAN
GO BACK TO DOING THINGS MY WAY?

24:03.270 --> 24:05.067
- AND WHAT WAY IS THAT AGAIN?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.907
- YOU KNOW,
WE FOLLOW A FEW LEADS,

24:06.940 --> 24:09.135
MAKE SOME INAPPROPRIATE JOKES,
I'LL REMEMBER SOME STUFF,

24:09.180 --> 24:10.431
AND THEN WE'LL
TIP OFF THE POLICE

24:10.480 --> 24:12.038
USING A LITTLE BIT OF THIS.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.843
- YOU GOT IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.314
- ALL RIGHT, NOW I WANT BOTH
YOU BOYS IN THERE WITH ME

24:16.350 --> 24:19.717
IN THE EVENT
SHE NEEDS TO BE RESTRAINED.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.059
NOW, HAVE EITHER OF YOU BEEN
INVOLVED IN AN EXORCISM?

24:22.090 --> 24:23.216
- NO.
- NO.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.558
- YOU NEED
TO BE STRONG IN THERE.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.729
UNDERSTAND?

24:27.760 --> 24:29.728
ALL RIGHT,
NOW LET'S BRING IT IN.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.995
- OKAY.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.792
- [laughing]
THIS ISN'T A BALL GAME, BOYS.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.603
- [laughing]
- YOU.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.858
- I ALWAYS TRY TO START EVERY
EXORCISM WITH A LITTLE HUMOR.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.207
- CHECK THIS ONE OUT.

24:41.240 --> 24:44.243
A PRIEST, A RABB--
- IT'S OVER NOW.

24:44.280 --> 24:45.941
LET'S GO.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.446
NOW.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.289
- RIGHT NOW.
[clears throat]

24:59.530 --> 25:01.327
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT DEMONS
WILL DO EVERYTHING

25:01.360 --> 25:03.248
IN THEIR POWER
TO KEEP FROM GETTING EXPELLED.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.029
AND THEIR POWERS ARE GREAT.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.958
AND THEY KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT US--

25:07.000 --> 25:09.992
FACTS, DREAMS, INNER DESIRES.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.258
AND THEY WON'T HESITATE
TO USE THEM AGAINST YOU.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.305
- HELLO?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:17.340 --> 25:20.912
- SHH, WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.247
- BUT I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.282
I'M FINE.
- SEE THAT? SHE'S FINE.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.083
GREAT WORK.
WHO'S UP FOR SOME FRO-YO?

25:26.120 --> 25:28.953
- SHE'S LYING IN ORDER
TO GET US TO LEAVE.

25:28.990 --> 25:30.924
- IF I WOKE UP AND THERE
WERE TWO RANDOM DUDES

25:30.960 --> 25:34.123
AND A PRIEST STANDING OVER ME,
I'D LIE TOO.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.525
- HOLY WATER.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.597
- IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER--
- STOP IT! STOP IT!

25:38.630 --> 25:40.461
STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT!
- THE HOLY GHOST--

25:40.500 --> 25:41.762
HOLD HER DOWN.
- STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT!

25:41.800 --> 25:43.609
- NOW!
HOLD HER DOWN.

25:43.640 --> 25:48.430
- [screaming]

25:48.480 --> 25:50.505
- YOU'RE OKAY, YOU'RE OKAY,
YOU'RE OKAY, YOU'RE OKAY.

25:50.540 --> 25:53.441
- [giggIeSJ
YOU'RE HOT.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.119
- WHY, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE NOT SO BAD YOURSELF.

25:56.150 --> 25:58.516
MAYBE A LITTLE--
WELL, YOUNG.

25:58.550 --> 26:00.757
- SHE'S USING LIES
TO DISTRACT YOU, SHAWN.

26:00.790 --> 26:03.315
- WELL, IT'S NOT FAIR
TO ASSUME SHE'S LYING.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.725
- SILENCE!

26:04.760 --> 26:06.352
BE GONE, SATAN!

26:06.390 --> 26:09.598
INVENTOR AND MASTER
OF ALL DECEIT, BE GONE!

26:09.630 --> 26:11.996
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
[nervous laughter]

26:12.030 --> 26:14.931
CARSON D.'S GOT SIMON BAKER
ON TONIGHT.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.335
THAT'S A CAN'T-MISS, OKAY?

26:16.370 --> 26:18.338
SO I'M GONNA GO, YOU GUYS
CAN KEEP EXORCISING.

26:18.370 --> 26:21.271
- I KNOW ABOUT MR. RENO.

26:21.310 --> 26:24.177
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

26:24.210 --> 26:26.747
- HE WAS YOUR
SEVENTH GRADE SHOP TEACHER.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.214
YOU PLACED A TACK ON HIS CHAIR.

26:29.250 --> 26:32.378
- [scoffs]
HOW DID YOU--

26:32.420 --> 26:33.785
DID YOU TELL HER THAT?

26:33.820 --> 26:35.651
- NO.

26:35.690 --> 26:37.180
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GAVE HIM BLOOD POISONING.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.824
- NO, WE DON'T
KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.122
- GET HIM OUT OF HERE, GUS.

26:40.160 --> 26:44.119
- THE MAN MADE A LIVING
HANDLING RUSTY METALS.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.365
- FATHER WESTLEY, WHAT IN GOD'S
NAME IS GOING ON IN HERE?

26:46.400 --> 26:49.267
LUCY?

26:50.740 --> 26:52.207
- GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.838
- [screaming]

27:02.880 --> 27:05.189
- [muffled commands]

27:07.290 --> 27:10.589
- YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO HER ABOUT MR. RENO?

27:10.620 --> 27:13.054
- NO.
- [screams]

27:13.090 --> 27:15.126
[crying]
both: STAY HERE.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.627
- IT'S OKAY.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.064
priests: THE MOST HIGH GOD
COMMANDS YOU!

27:20.100 --> 27:24.503
- NOMINE PATRIS, FILII,
ET SPIRITUS SANCTI...

27:27.880 --> 27:31.008
- WHOA.
- UH, DOUBLE WHOA.

27:36.680 --> 27:40.548
- IT'S OVER.
SHE'S CLEAN.

27:44.890 --> 27:46.027
- HOW'S SHE DOING?

27:46.060 --> 27:48.494
- SHE'S EXHAUSTED
AND A BIT CONFUSED.

27:48.530 --> 27:51.363
I HAVE TO SAY, SHE REALLY
SEEMS LIKE HER OLD SELF.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.197
I CAN'T THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.130
- IT'S FATHER WESTLEY
WHO DESERVES THE CREDIT.

27:55.170 --> 27:58.037
- OH, I WAS JUST
DOING THE LORD'S WORK.

27:58.070 --> 27:59.367
- THANK YOU, FATHER.

28:07.110 --> 28:09.670
- [sighs]
THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPLANATION

28:09.720 --> 28:11.540
FOR WHY AGATHA
WAS ACTING NUTS.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.046
TELL ME
YOU HAVE SOMETHING THERE.

28:13.090 --> 28:14.216
- I WISH WE DID.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.989
HER TOXICOLOGY REPORT
JUST CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.580
- WHOA.
- ARE YOU GETTING A PREMONITION?

28:18.630 --> 28:20.359
- NO, JUST A HEAD RUSH.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.153
HAPPENS TO ME QUITE A BIT
WHEN I'M SLEEP DEPRIVED.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.361
- SPENCER,
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THIS ONE.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.822
THAT GIRL WAS MURDERED.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.690
- I'M AFRAID THAT'S
NOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.367
- AND HOW COME?
- FIRST, BECAUSE YOU THINK

28:30.400 --> 28:32.163
SHE WAS MURDERED.
- I GUESS WE'LL SEE.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.700
- YEAH, WE WILL SEE.
- YEAH, WE'LL SEE.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.037
- I JUST SAID THAT.
- NO, I SAID IT--

28:35.080 --> 28:37.139
- BOYS.

28:39.110 --> 28:41.146
- SO, IF SHE HAD ANY DRUG
OF ANY KIND IN HER SYSTEM,

28:41.180 --> 28:42.977
IT WOULD SHOW UP
ON THIS REPORT?

28:43.020 --> 28:45.113
- NO.
- NO?

28:45.150 --> 28:46.447
- NO, JUST THE ONES
THEY TEST FOR.

28:46.490 --> 28:48.549
THE STANDARD NARCOTICS
AND A HANDFUL OF OTHERS, WHY?

28:48.590 --> 28:50.285
DO YOU HAVE
A SPECIFIC DRUG IN MIND?

28:50.320 --> 28:52.254
- NOT YET.

28:53.590 --> 28:55.729
...BURSTS OF ENERGY.
WHOA.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.557
HEY, GUS.
WHAT IS UP?

28:57.600 --> 28:59.488
- WHY ARE YOU
SITTING AT MY DESK?

28:59.530 --> 29:00.861
- JUST WORKING
ON MY STATUS UPDATES, MAN.

29:00.900 --> 29:01.992
CHECK THIS ONE OUT--

29:02.040 --> 29:04.065
"SHAWN SPENCER
IS TRADING IN HIS CHEW

29:04.110 --> 29:07.807
FOR A
CADILLAC-A- LAC-A- LAC-A- LAC."

29:07.840 --> 29:08.977
- THEN WHY--
- A-LAC-A-LAC.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.136
- THEN WHY WERE YOU--
- A-LAC.

29:10.180 --> 29:11.306
- SHAWN!
- WHAT?

29:11.350 --> 29:13.102
- WHY ARE YOU READING
MY INDEX OF MEDICATIONS?

29:13.150 --> 29:14.378
- BECAUSE IT'S HILARIOUS.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.739
THE SECTION ON THE MEDICATIONS

29:15.780 --> 29:19.045
THAT TREAT URINARY TRACT
INFECTIONS MADE ME PEE MY PANTS.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.580
WHICH IS IRONIC
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

29:20.620 --> 29:21.917
- YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING,
AREN'T YOU?

29:21.960 --> 29:23.825
- YEP. GOT TO GO.
THANKS FOR THE CAKE.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.919
- THAT'S A SPONGE
TO MOISTEN STAMPS.

29:28.130 --> 29:30.257
- DAD? YOU KNOW
I HATE COMING HERE,

29:30.300 --> 29:31.961
BUT I NEED
MORE PARTNER ADVICE.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.730
[video game
gunshots and chatter]

29:40.610 --> 29:42.100
WELL, THIS IS SAD.

29:42.140 --> 29:44.404
YOU HAVEN'T
GONE TO BED, HAVE YOU?

29:44.450 --> 29:45.542
- I TRIED,
BUT IT'S THIS GAME.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.002
IT'S LIKE
IT KEEPS CALLING ME BACK.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.813
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DO IT,
BUT IT LETS YOU FEEL LIKE A COP

29:48.850 --> 29:50.670
WITHOUT ALL THE GUILT
AFTER YOU SHOOT SOMEONE.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.541
[gunfire and screams]

29:53.590 --> 29:55.683
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:55.720 --> 29:57.415
AH!
- DAD...

29:58.930 --> 30:00.659
INSIDE PLAYING
VIDEO GAMES ALL DAY.

30:00.690 --> 30:02.294
YOU SHOULD BE
OUTDOORS FEEDING PIGEONS,

30:02.330 --> 30:03.627
AND DRIVING
WITH YOUR BLINKER ON.

30:03.660 --> 30:04.866
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, SHAWN?

30:04.900 --> 30:06.265
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU REMEMBER I ASKED YOU

30:06.300 --> 30:08.495
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO WHEN
YOU THINK YOUR PARTNER'S WRONG?

30:09.840 --> 30:11.705
WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN YOU KNOW THEY ARE?

30:13.140 --> 30:14.505
- THAT'S SIMPLE...

30:14.540 --> 30:16.235
YOU TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.498
BUT IN THE
MOST RESPECT FUL WAY POSSIBLE.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.142
- YOU WERE WRONG.

30:23.180 --> 30:26.013
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.

30:26.050 --> 30:27.688
FINGER-GUNS.
PSHOO, WRONG.

30:27.720 --> 30:29.608
PSHOO, WRONG.
WRONG ON YOUR WEENIE, PSHOO.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.184
- SHAWN,
PUT DOWN THE FINGER-GUNS.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.084
- AGATHA WASN'T POSSESSED.
SHE WAS DRUGGED.

30:33.130 --> 30:35.325
- I SAW THE TOXICOLOGY REPORT,
SHE WAS CLEAN.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.918
- THE PRELIMINARY
REPORT, SURE.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.689
BUT THEY DON'T TEST
FOR EVERYTHING IN THOSE.

30:38.730 --> 30:40.493
WHICH IS WHY
I MADE A LIST OF MEDICATIONS

30:40.530 --> 30:42.236
WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL
SIDE EFFECTS

30:42.270 --> 30:43.635
AND HAD THEM TEST
FOR THOSE AS WELL.

30:43.670 --> 30:47.970
AND GUESS WHICH ONE
THEY FOUND IN HER SYSTEM.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.375
L-DOPA.

30:49.410 --> 30:52.345
- THE PARKINSON'S MEDICATION?
- CORRECTAMUNDO.

30:52.380 --> 30:55.213
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO SOMEONE WHO TAKES L-DOPA

30:55.250 --> 30:57.218
THAT DOESN'T
HAVE PARKINSON'S?

30:57.250 --> 30:59.787
THEY EXPERIENCE
EXTREME EMOTIONAL STATES,

30:59.820 --> 31:02.948
DISILLUSIONMENT, AND
UNCONTROLLABLE BURSTS OF ENERGY.

31:02.990 --> 31:05.185
WHAT'S UP?
SOUND LIKE ANYONE WE KNOW?

31:05.230 --> 31:06.549
_ THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE LAMP,

31:06.590 --> 31:08.854
OR HOW LUCY KNEW THE GERMAN,
OR THE TACK STORY.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.458
- ALL RIGHT, IN ORDER.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.967
TH E LAM P--

31:12.000 --> 31:13.126
THE CHICK WAS FLAILING ABOUT,

31:13.170 --> 31:15.092
SHE WAS
GRABBING AT EVERYTHING.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.232
[shattering glass]

31:16.270 --> 31:18.738
THE GERMAN--

31:18.770 --> 31:20.909
JEDEN TAG TRIFFST
DE EINE ENTSCHEIDUNG

31:20.940 --> 31:23.204
ET CETERA IS A LINE
FROM RUN LOLA RUN,

31:23.240 --> 31:25.902
WHICH ACCORDING TO HER PAGE
IS HER FAVORITE MOVIE.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.669
I MEAN, IT'S A NICE LITTLE FILM,
BUT FAVORITE? REALLY?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.574
IT ENDS IN THE MIDDLE
AND STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN--

31:30.620 --> 31:32.247
- SHAWN.
- ANYWAY, SPEAKING

31:32.290 --> 31:36.010
OF PERSONAL NETWORKING SITES,
I FORGOT THAT OUR GOOD FRIEND

31:36.060 --> 31:38.779
STUMPY FROM GRADE SCHOOL
POSTED THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE

31:38.830 --> 31:40.479
ON MY
PAGE A FEW MONTHS BACK.

31:40.530 --> 31:42.122
[English accent]
"HELLO, SHAWN.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.559
"REMEMBER WHEN YOU PUT
THAT TACK

31:43.600 --> 31:46.489
ON MR. RENO'S CHAIR
AND GAVE HIM BLOOD POISONING?"

31:46.530 --> 31:47.929
- STUMPY WASN'T BRITISH, SHAWN.

31:47.970 --> 31:50.097
- MY PAGE IS
OPEN FOR PUBLIC VIEWING

31:50.140 --> 31:52.404
SO THAT OUR POTENTIAL CLIENTS
CAN CHECK US OUT.

31:52.440 --> 31:56.501
CLEARLY SHE WENT ONTO IT
AFTER WE STOPPED BY YESTERDAY.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.747
- SO, YOU THINK THEY WERE JUST
POPPING PARKINSON'S PILLS?

31:58.780 --> 32:00.509
- NO, THEY WERE
BEING GIVEN TO THEM SECRETLY.

32:00.550 --> 32:02.711
- BY WHO?
- SOMEONE WITH ACCESS

32:02.750 --> 32:05.913
TO THE MEDICATION--
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE BAD NEWS.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.380
- FATHER WESTLEY?

32:10.420 --> 32:13.526
- [sighs] HE WAS
DIAGNOSED TEN YEARS AGO.

32:13.560 --> 32:16.051
I'M SORRY, DUDE.
IT ALL CHECKS OUT.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.727
GUESS WHAT HE TAKES.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.967
- L-DOPA.
- EVERY DAY.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.992
- NO. THERE'S NO WAY.

32:26.540 --> 32:29.976
BACK IN THE '705, WHEN DISCO
AND EXORCISMS WERE ALL THE RAGE,

32:30.010 --> 32:31.409
HE WAS THE MAN.

32:31.450 --> 32:35.568
STRUTTING AROUND, EXORCISING
DEMONS IN HIS POLYESTER CASSOCK.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.679
CUT TO 30 YEARS LATER,
AND ALL THE YOUNGER MEMBERS

32:37.720 --> 32:39.585
OF THE CHURCH TREAT HIM
LIKE A CRAZY OLD MAN.

32:39.620 --> 32:40.848
SO WHAT DOES HE DO?

32:40.890 --> 32:44.849
HE TRIES TO CREATE A POSSESSION
TO PROVE THEM ALL WRONG.

32:44.890 --> 32:46.448
HE DRUGS THE CHICK
WITH THE OUIJA BOARD--

32:46.490 --> 32:48.549
THAT GOES TERRIBLY AWRY.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.194
HE REALIZES
HE HAS ONE LAST CHANCE.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.964
WHEN HE LEARNS THAT LUCY
WAS NEXT TO HER WHEN SHE DIED.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.764
SO HE MAKES HER POSSESSED.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.106
I REALLY AM SORRY, BUDDY.

33:18.390 --> 33:21.791
- YOU'RE DOING OKAY?
- OH, I CAN'T COMPLAIN.

33:21.830 --> 33:24.765
MY VOWS OF POVERTY
AND ABSTINENCE

33:24.800 --> 33:27.621
THAT I TOOK 40 YEARS AGO
PREPARED ME QUITE WELL

33:27.670 --> 33:30.264
FOR PRISON LIFE.
[laughing]

33:31.510 --> 33:35.332
GUS, YOU BELIEVE
I'M INNOCENT, RIGHT?

33:35.380 --> 33:37.109
-IDO.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.108
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
TO PROVE IT.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.675
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO
HAD ACCESS TO YOUR MEDICATION?

33:41.720 --> 33:44.109
- WELL, I SUPPOSE THERE
WERE A LOT.

33:44.150 --> 33:47.187
YOU KNOW, I KEPT IT
IN THE TOP DRAWER OF MY DESK,

33:47.220 --> 33:49.313
I RARELY EVER
LOCKED MY OFFICE.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.124
- DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE WHO MAY
HAVE HAD IT OUT FOR AGATHA?

33:52.160 --> 33:53.752
- NO.

33:54.330 --> 33:56.389
NO, I--

33:57.400 --> 33:58.628
[sighs]
OH.

34:00.370 --> 34:06.104
ACTUALLY, SOMEONE
DOES COME TO MIND.
-WHO?

34:06.140 --> 34:07.869
- I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

34:07.910 --> 34:11.175
THEY REVEALED IT
TO ME DURING CONFESSION.

34:11.210 --> 34:13.440
- YOU CAN'T MAKE
THIS EXCEPTION JUST ONCE?

34:13.480 --> 34:16.415
- AS A MAN OF THE CLOTH,
YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

34:16.450 --> 34:19.044
- HOW ABOUT
A MAN OF THE ORANGE CLOTH?

34:19.090 --> 34:21.615
- [sighs]
- YOUR FREEDOM IS AT STAKE HERE.

34:21.660 --> 34:24.220
- I HAVE TOTAL FAITH
THAT THE LORD

34:24.260 --> 34:26.285
WILL GET ME
THROUGH THIS, GUS.

34:27.360 --> 34:31.968
UNTIL THEN, I HAVE MY BIBLE
TO GIVE ME STRENGTH.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.037
PROVERBS 11:6.

34:35.070 --> 34:38.938
IT'S BEEN ESPECIALLY
COMFORTING TO ME AS OF LATE.

34:38.970 --> 34:43.009
- TIME'S UP.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.043
- DAD?

34:53.090 --> 34:54.409
[can rattles]

34:54.460 --> 34:55.859
- SHAWN?
IS THAT YOU?

34:55.890 --> 34:57.414
- UH, YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S ME.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.087
BUT THERE'S NO REASON
TO COME DOWN.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.779
I'M JUST HERE--

35:00.830 --> 35:03.219
I'M JUST HERE
TO FINISH UP THE PAINTING.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.424
- DUDE, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

35:06.470 --> 35:08.097
- SHH, NOW IS NOT
THE BEST TIME.

35:08.140 --> 35:10.028
- FATHER WESTLEY IS INNOCENT.
- WHAT?

35:10.070 --> 35:12.300
- SOMEONE CONFIDED IN HIM
THAT THEY HAD IT OUT FOR AGATHA.

35:12.340 --> 35:13.534
BUT HE CAN'T SAY WHO IT IS

35:13.570 --> 35:15.299
BECAUSE IT WAS
TOLD TO HIM DURING CONFESSION.

35:15.340 --> 35:16.978
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
ARE YOU SAYING YOU HAVE

35:17.010 --> 35:19.478
A HUNCH BASED
ON UNVERIFIABLE INFORMATION?

35:19.510 --> 35:21.546
- THAT'S WHAT YOU USE
TO SOLVE EVERY CASE.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.116
- OKAY, THAT STINGS.

35:23.150 --> 35:24.344
IT'S TRUE, THOUGH.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.539
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

35:25.590 --> 35:27.012
- HE DID SAY
HE'S BEEN GETTING STRENGTH

35:27.050 --> 35:28.586
FROM A PARTICULAR PROVERB.

35:28.620 --> 35:30.508
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
LET'S DO A QUICK LIST.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.084
"YOU CAN'T TEACH
AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS"?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.950
"A BIRD IN THE HAND'S
WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH"?

35:33.990 --> 35:35.196
"IF IT'S BROWN,
FLUSH IT DOWN"?

35:35.230 --> 35:37.653
- SHAWN, PROVERBS 11:6.
THE BIBLE.

35:41.130 --> 35:42.392
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

35:42.440 --> 35:45.329
- NOTHING IS GOING ON.
WHERE IS YOUR BIBLE?

35:45.370 --> 35:48.339
- I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.940
WHERE DID I PUT IT?
- GOSH.

35:53.510 --> 35:55.944
REALLY?
- HERE, LET ME SEE THAT.

35:55.980 --> 35:57.777
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
THIS IS JUST A SHOT IN THE DARK,

35:57.820 --> 35:59.640
BUT I THINK MAYBE--
MAYBE

35:59.690 --> 36:01.612
FATHER WESTLEY WAS TRYING
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

36:01.660 --> 36:04.117
WITH THE PROVERB
THAT HE MENTIONED.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.980
WHERE'S THE TABLE OF CONTENTS
IN THIS THING?

36:06.030 --> 36:08.191
- WOW.
- TELL YOU WHAT, YOU DO THIS,

36:08.230 --> 36:12.826
I AM GONNA GO PRIME THE OUTSIDE,
'CAUSE I'M GONNA PAINT!

36:12.870 --> 36:15.634
- IF YOU LEAVE WITH THAT BAG,
I WILL PULL OUT MY GUN.

36:15.670 --> 36:17.399
- ALL RIGHT,
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:17.440 --> 36:19.601
YOU NEED HELP.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.677
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

36:22.710 --> 36:24.849
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

36:24.880 --> 36:26.177
- OKAY, HERE IT IS.

36:26.210 --> 36:28.474
"THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF
THE UPRIGHT WILL SAVE THEM,

36:28.520 --> 36:31.387
THE UNFAITHFUL WILL BE
TRAPPED BY EVIL DESIRES."

36:33.090 --> 36:35.217
- THE UNFAITHFUL...

36:36.590 --> 36:38.888
WILL BE TRAPPED BY EVIL DESIRES.
THAT'S GOOD.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.332
- WHAT UP?
- HELLO, CAMERON.

36:48.370 --> 36:51.931
- HEY, GUYS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:51.970 --> 36:53.631
- UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE HERE TO TELL YOU

36:53.670 --> 36:55.706
THAT YOU ARE UNDER ARREST
FOR POSSESSION

36:55.740 --> 36:57.879
OF AN ILLEGAL HOT PLATE.

36:58.980 --> 37:02.279
- WHAT?
- JUST MESSING WITH YOU, MAN.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.548
WE WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

37:03.580 --> 37:04.979
WE THOUGHT
WE'D COME BY AND SAY HEY.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.909
- UM...

37:07.950 --> 37:09.212
- ARE WE INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

37:09.260 --> 37:10.909
- WELL, ACT UALLY--

37:10.960 --> 37:12.723
- CAM?

37:12.760 --> 37:14.819
- [whistles]
- WHOA.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.953
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.093
- PUT A SOCK
ON THE DOOR NEXT TIME.

37:19.130 --> 37:22.293
- LUCY AND I
WERE JUST COMFORTING EACH OTHER.

37:22.340 --> 37:25.002
- IS THAT WHAT THE CHURCH
IS CALLING IT THESE DAYS?

37:25.040 --> 37:26.667
YOU MIND TO TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON, SHAWN?

37:26.710 --> 37:28.473
- I KNOW WHO
WAS DRUGGING AGATHA,

37:28.510 --> 37:31.104
AND IT WASN'T FATHER WESTLEY.

37:31.140 --> 37:33.142
- YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS ME,
DO YOU?

37:33.180 --> 37:35.512
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, LASSIE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

37:35.550 --> 37:38.383
- GREAT, NOW I KNOW
FOR SURE THAT IT WAS...

37:38.420 --> 37:40.479
LUCY.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.919
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:41.960 --> 37:43.757
- COME ON.
ADMIT IT.

37:43.790 --> 37:45.428
YOU WANTED CAM
THE WHOLE TIME

37:45.460 --> 37:46.779
THAT HE AND AGATHA
WERE TOGETHER.

37:46.830 --> 37:48.491
- NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S SO NOT TRUE.

37:48.530 --> 37:50.555
- YEAH, LUCY AND I
HAVE ALWAYS JUST BEEN FRIENDS.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.795
- OH, CAM,
DON'T BE SO NAIVE.

37:52.830 --> 37:54.127
MEN AND WOMEN
CAN'T BE FRIENDS.

37:54.170 --> 37:55.637
- WHEN HARRY MET SALLY
TAUGHT US THAT.

37:55.670 --> 37:59.037
- IT ALSO TAUGHT US
THAT WOMEN OFTEN FAKE ORGASMS.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.367
- MM-HMM.

38:00.410 --> 38:02.605
LUCY, YOU WANTED HIM BADLY.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.449
SO BADLY THAT IT WAS
FILLING YOU WITH GUILT.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.574
SO MUCH GUILT THAT YOU HAD
TO GO AND CONFESS TO SOMEONE

38:07.610 --> 38:09.578
IN ORDER TO GET IT OFF
YOUR CHEST, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

38:09.620 --> 38:11.884
- DID FATHER WESTLEY
TELL YOU ABOUT THAT?

38:11.920 --> 38:14.787
- NO, YOU JUST DID.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.685
- I KNOW HOW
THIS MOVIE ENDS.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.484
- YEP, SHE DESPERATELY
WANTED THEM TO BREAK UP.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.521
SO SHE STOLE
FATHER WESTLEY'S MEDICATION

38:21.560 --> 38:23.824
AND SECRETLY GAVE IT
TO AGATHA IN HOPES

38:23.860 --> 38:25.418
THAT THE POOR GIRL WOULD
ACT SO CRAZY

38:25.470 --> 38:26.960
THAT CAMERON WOULD DUMP HER.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.537
- BUT AGATHA ENDED UP DUMPING
HIM, BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER.

38:29.570 --> 38:31.731
BECAUSE LUCY
GOT WHAT LUCY WANTED.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.135
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

38:33.170 --> 38:35.070
THE MEDICATION
MADE AGATHA TOO CRAZY.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.175
- AH!
- AGATHA!

38:38.210 --> 38:40.542
- AND THEN LUCY WAS TRAPPED.

38:40.580 --> 38:42.138
'CAUSE IT WAS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE

38:42.180 --> 38:43.647
SOMEONE UNCOVERED
YOUR LITTLE PLAN.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.841
- THEN SHE OVERHEARD
FATHER WESTLEY'S PROCLAMATION.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.881
- SHE WAS POSSESSED.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.785
- AND SHE FIGURED
SHE HAD THE PERFECT THING

38:49.820 --> 38:51.481
TO THROW US OFF THE TRAIL.

38:51.530 --> 38:55.022
- PROPS TO YOU FOR YOUR
PERFORMANCE AS A POSSESSED GIRL.

38:55.060 --> 38:56.755
LINDA BLAIR WOULD BE PROUD.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.427
AND NOW YOU CAN DO YOUR
BEST IMPRESSION OF HER

38:58.470 --> 39:00.859
IN CHAINED HEAT.
- AND?

39:00.900 --> 39:02.538
- RED HEAT.
- RIGHT.

39:02.570 --> 39:04.037
- TWO PRISON MOVIES!

39:04.070 --> 39:06.709
- PSHOO, PSHOO!
- IS THIS TRUE?

39:10.740 --> 39:11.877
LUCY?

39:11.910 --> 39:15.448
- NO, NO, I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT HER, HONEST.

39:15.480 --> 39:19.644
I JUST--I JUST KNEW
THAT SHE WASN'T RIGHT FOR YOU.

39:27.790 --> 39:29.894
- LET'S GO.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.742
- OKAY, YOU'RE UP.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.839
- LOOK,
I'M HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS

39:50.880 --> 39:52.780
ABOUT THIS
WHOLE CONFESSION THING.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.959
- YOU PROMISED ME
YOU'D GO JUST ONCE, SHAWN.

39:54.990 --> 39:56.082
- I KNOW, I KNOW I DID.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.759
BUT IT'S FATHER WESTLEY,
AND HE KNOWS ME.

39:58.790 --> 40:00.382
AND IT JUST--
IT FEELS WEIRD.

40:00.430 --> 40:03.490
- TRUST ME, YOU'LL FEEL
BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF.

40:03.530 --> 40:05.998
GO ON.

40:08.070 --> 40:10.368
- WRONG DOOR.

40:16.440 --> 40:21.207
- UM...BLESS ME FATHER
FOR I HAVE SINNED,

40:25.550 --> 40:30.010
15 YEARS
SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.221
- WOW.
- WOW?

40:32.260 --> 40:34.057
THAT'S NOT VERY PRIESTLY...

40:34.090 --> 40:37.423
I DON'T THINK.
[exhales]
WHATEVER.

40:37.460 --> 40:40.588
AS FAR AS THE SINNING GOES,
I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR AS TO

40:40.630 --> 40:41.892
WHAT'S STILL
ON THE LIST NOWADAYS.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.966
I'M ASSUMING THAT STEALING
IS STILL A NO-NO, RIGHT?

40:45.010 --> 40:46.932
- THAT'S CORRECT.
- OKAY, AND THEN GREED?

40:46.970 --> 40:48.506
- YES.
- IMPURE THOUGHTS?

40:48.540 --> 40:49.939
- BIG TIME.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.800
- DO YOU HAVE ANY PLACE YOU NEED
TO BE ANYTIME SOON, FATHER?

40:51.850 --> 40:53.249
'CAUSE THIS
COULD TAKE A WHILE.

40:53.280 --> 40:55.840
LET'S START WITH THE LYING.
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.747
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS:
NATURE OF MY JOB.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.940
- YEAH, GO ON.

41:00.990 --> 41:03.914
- I'D RATHER SWITCH OVER
TO STEALING, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.882
I DON'T DO IT OFTEN,

41:05.930 --> 41:08.285
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S
BEEN GNAWING AT ME LATELY.

41:09.860 --> 41:12.863
GUS, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

41:14.370 --> 41:17.134
HERE'S THE THING,
I'VE BEEN STEALING FOOD

41:17.170 --> 41:20.469
THAT MY GUS HIDES IN HIS DESK
AND EATING IT.

41:20.510 --> 41:23.729
AND THEN BLAMING IT
ON THE CLEANING LADY ONELIA.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.600
- I KNEW IT!
I KNEW IT!

41:25.650 --> 41:27.777
- DAMN IT.
OOH.

41:27.810 --> 41:29.812
WAS THAT WORD A SIN?
- YES.

41:29.850 --> 41:31.818
- WELL, I'M SORRY.

41:31.850 --> 41:35.183
ONE THING I WASN'T LYING ABOUT
WAS THE COMMERCIAL JINGLES.

41:35.220 --> 41:38.758
PERHAPS, I COULD HELP
THE CHURCH OUT WITH A NEW THEME.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.121
UM...

41:40.160 --> 41:43.493
* BOOM, BOOM, BOOM

41:43.530 --> 41:46.658
* WAFERS

41:46.700 --> 41:48.565
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

41:48.600 --> 41:49.737
THAT'S NOT THE ONE.

41:49.770 --> 41:50.839
LET ME--
LET ME TRY THIS.

41:50.870 --> 41:52.337
- MM.

41:52.370 --> 41:54.406
- * BOOM, BOOM, BOOM

41:54.440 --> 42:00.401
* HOLY GHOST

42:00.450 --> 42:03.044
- I LIKE THAT.
HOLY GHOST.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.411
- YEAH?
- YES.
