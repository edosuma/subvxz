MATCHED THE SMILE ON THE CAKE.

03:52.917 --> 03:55.667

CAN YOU DO A CONSULT?

03:55.709 --> 03:57.458

INTO AN ARM BAR,

05:45.083 --> 05:48.041

REMEMBER, WASSERMAN
HAS NEVER BEEN PINNED.

05:48.083 --> 05:50.500

NEXT THING I REMEMBER,

05:50.542 --> 05:53.208
THE COACHES
ARE STANDING OVER ME.
ANY DIZZINESS
BEFORE THAT DAY?

05:53.250 --> 05:55.250
NEVER.
AND HOW ABOUT SINCE?

05:55.291 --> 05:57.417
I WAS A LITTLE LIGHT-HEADED
AFTER PRACTICE YESTERDAY.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.625
YOU'RE BACK
AT PRACTICE ALREADY?

05:59.667 --> 06:01.625
OH, NOT AT SCHOOL.
COACH WON'T LET ME.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.458

06:04.500 --> 06:06.458
PLACE IS GOING TO BE PACKED

TYLER HAS TO PERFORM.

06:09.083 --> 06:12.000

DIVISION I.
OKAY.

06:18.917 --> 06:21.333
DR. BENNETT,
TOOK A LOOK AT HIM.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.583
CAN WE DO THIS TODAY?

06:23.625 --> 06:27.041
IT'S JUST--WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
TY WRESTLES THIS WEEK.

06:27.083 --> 06:29.792
HIS SCHOLARSHIP--EVERYTHING
DEPENDS ON HIM BEING THERE AND--

06:29.834 --> 06:32.041
OKAY, WE NEED YOU
TO SIGN THIS.

06:32.083 --> 06:34.041

HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO YOU.

06:36.542 --> 06:38.500

HIS HEART IS FINE,

06:38.542 --> 06:40.709
I WILL SIGN IT.

06:45.625 --> 06:47.583
THIS ISN'T SOME TAWDRY THING.
IT'S--

06:47.625 --> 06:50.709
CRAZY. I'M--EVEN IF
IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU,

06:50.750 --> 06:53.041
YOU--YOU'RE CHEATING
ON YOUR WIFE WITH HER SISTER--

06:53.083 --> 06:55.083

YOUR CHILD.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.041

06:59.083 --> 07:01.041
NO, NO.

07:01.083 --> 07:03.959
WE DID IN VITRO WITH MY SPERM
AND CLAUDINE'S EGG

07:04.000 --> 07:06.291
BEFORE ANY OF THIS HAPPENED.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.291

WHAT I CAN SAY.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.917
H-HOW DO YOU THINK
THIS IS GONNA TURN OUT?

07:10.959 --> 07:12.917
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO GET IT.

07:12.959 --> 07:15.709
I MEAN,
BEFORE LORRAINE WAS SICK,

07:15.750 --> 07:18.417
THINGS WEREN'T GREAT
BETWEEN US.

07:18.458 --> 07:22.041
AND WE TRIED TO WORK IT OUT,
BUT THEN THE CANCER CAME ON.

07:22.083 --> 07:25.083
AND CLAUDINE AND I,
WE TOOK CARE OF HER.

07:25.125 --> 07:28.458
SPENT A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER,
TALKING AND...

07:28.500 --> 07:32.458
TRYING TO LAUGH THROUGH
HOW SCARED WE WERE.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.542
AND CLAUDINE, SHE--
SHE UNDERSTOOD ME.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.917
THOSE FEELINGS,

07:37.959 --> 07:40.917
THEY KEPT GETTING STRONGER
UNTIL ONE NIGHT--

07:40.959 --> 07:44.041
AND NOW YOU'RE HERE. FINE.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.750
BUT... LORRAINE DESERVES
TO KNOW.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.125
YOU GET THAT, RIGHT?

07:48.166 --> 07:50.667
SH-SHE'LL KNOW. SHE'LL KNOW.

07:50.709 --> 07:52.875
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN...

07:52.917 --> 07:56.000
I'M GONNA LEAVE LORRAINE
TO BE WITH CLAUDINE.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.709
HEY.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.041
HEY.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.709
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

08:07.750 --> 08:09.083
WHAT?

08:09.125 --> 08:11.709
IN THE KITCHEN.
YOU MAD AT VIOLET?

08:11.750 --> 08:12.917
NO.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.041
ARE YOU JEALOUS
OF VIOLET?

08:15.083 --> 08:17.041
(laughs) WHY WOULD I
BE JEALOUS?

08:17.083 --> 08:20.083
WELL, YOU TELL ME.
VIOLET IS A GREAT SHRINK,

08:20.125 --> 08:22.333
AND NOW
SHE'S A PUBLISHED AUTHOR.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.208
NAOMI BUILDS HOSPITALS
ALL AROUND THE WORLD

08:24.250 --> 08:27.500
IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING
MIRACLES AT A FERTILITY CLINIC.

08:27.542 --> 08:29.500
AND PETE,
HE'S ALREADY SAVED LIVES

08:29.542 --> 08:32.083
IN BASICALLY EVERY COUNTRY
NAOMI'S GOING TO, NOT TO MENTION

08:32.125 --> 08:34.709
BEING AN E.R. DOC
AND AN EXPERT IN CRITICAL CARE

08:34.750 --> 08:36.083

08:36.125 --> 08:39.083
AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE YOUNGEST
CHIEFS OF STAFFS IN THE COUNTRY,

08:39.125 --> 08:41.083
AND EVERYONE IS DOING
SOMETHING SPECIAL--

08:41.125 --> 08:43.750
EVERYONE EXCEPT FOR ME.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.834
GROW UP, COOPER.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.250
YOU LOOK LIKE CRAP.

08:54.291 --> 08:56.667
UGH. THANK YOU.

08:56.709 --> 08:59.333
FLU?
YOU DON'T FEEL WARM.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.333
DID YOU EAT ANYTHING WEIRD?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.458
NO.
SO WHAT'S WRONG

09:03.500 --> 09:06.250

I DON'T KNOW.

09:06.291 --> 09:08.250
AMELIA, I JUST DON'T

09:08.291 --> 09:11.208

09:11.250 --> 09:13.583
I JUST... I DON'T KNOW.

09:13.625 --> 09:16.208
MAYBE IT'S JUST SOME SORT
OF... DELAYED REACTION

09:16.250 --> 09:18.208
TO THE BIZZY STRESS.

09:18.250 --> 09:21.166
MAYBE.
HAVE YOU GAINED ANY WEIGHT?

09:21.208 --> 09:23.166
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE
JUST BEING MEAN.

09:23.208 --> 09:27.375
ARE YOU PEEING A LOT?
YOUR BOOBS--ARE THEY TENDER?

09:27.417 --> 09:30.250
OKAY, YOU ARE A NEUROSURGEON.
I AM A GYNECOLOGIST.

09:30.291 --> 09:33.583
ALL RIGHT, IF I WERE,
I WOULD KNOW, AND I'M NOT.

09:33.625 --> 09:36.041
OKAY? I CAN'T BE.
DO YOU AND SAM
USE PROTECTION?

09:36.083 --> 09:39.083
AMELIA, I'M TELLING YOU,
I CAN'T--
ARE YOU LATE?

09:41.083 --> 09:42.208
YES.

09:42.250 --> 09:45.667
BUT I CAN'T BE.
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK--

09:45.709 --> 09:47.667
YOU'RE PREGGERS!

09:47.709 --> 09:49.500
THIS IS AWESOME.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.667
AUNTIE AMELIA.

09:58.709 --> 10:00.709
EVEN THOUGH YOU DIVORCED
MY BROTHER,

10:00.750 --> 10:03.083
I'M STILL GONNA BE
YOUR KID'S AUNT, RIGHT?

10:03.125 --> 10:05.083
(sighs) AMELIA,
FOR ME TO GET PREGNANT,

10:05.125 --> 10:07.041
IT WOULD TAKE A MIRACLE.

10:07.083 --> 10:10.041
A MIRACLE THAT I AM
GOING TO SPOIL ROTTEN.

10:10.083 --> 10:13.417
I THINK I'M GONNA TAKE HER
TO PARIS FOR HER 13th BIRTHDAY.

10:13.458 --> 10:16.625
YOU WANT TO COME?
YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND.
I AM NOT PREGNANT.

10:16.667 --> 10:19.834
IF ONLY THERE WAS
SOME WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.417
WAIT. WAIT.

10:21.458 --> 10:25.041
I WAS OUT SHOPPING,
AND I SAW THESE TESTS--

10:25.083 --> 10:27.542
KNOCK IT OFF.
JUST PEE ON A STICK.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.542
I'M BUSY.
YOU ARE STALLING.

10:29.583 --> 10:32.000
YOU LIKE THE IDEA.
(sighs)

10:32.041 --> 10:34.125
ADMIT IT. ADMIT IT.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.417
I AM NOT GONNA GO AWAY
UNTIL YOU ADMIT THAT--
GO!

10:41.375 --> 10:43.583
(door opens)

10:43.625 --> 10:45.667
(door closes)

10:45.709 --> 10:47.083
(Sam) SEE THAT?

10:47.125 --> 10:49.041
THAT SLIGHT THICKENING
OF THE SEPTAL WALL

10:49.083 --> 10:52.458
AND AN ELEVATED FLOW
ACROSS THE L.V. OUTFLOW TRACT.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.458
LOOKS LIKE
HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.750
IT'S BORDERLINE.

10:56.792 --> 10:58.750
DOES THAT PUT TYLER
AT RISK FOR AN ARRHYTHMIA?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.792
WELL, HE MAY NEVER HAVE
A PROBLEM.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.041
THERE ARE CASES, RARE,
BUT THEY HAPPEN,

11:03.083 --> 11:05.166
WHEN THE MOST
SEEMINGLY HEALTHY KID

11:05.208 --> 11:07.041
COULD JUST DIE SUDDENLY.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.041
IS THERE ANY WAY TO KNOW?

11:09.083 --> 11:11.792
WELL, WE COULD START
WITH AN M.R.I., WATCH HIM

11:11.834 --> 11:14.083
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.
IN TWO DAYS, IT WON'T MATTER.

11:14.125 --> 11:16.083
I MEAN, THIS KID HAS A CHANCE
TO CHANGE HIS LIFE.

11:16.125 --> 11:18.083
HE CAN GET A SCHOLARSHIP
TO COLLEGE.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.333
I DON'T THINK
HE CAN AFFORD IT OTHERWISE.

11:20.375 --> 11:23.000
BUT HE HAS TO COMPETE
IN THE CONFERENCE FINALS,

11:23.041 --> 11:25.959
AND GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES--
WELL, I'M NOT SAYING
HE CAN'T WRESTLE.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.750
YOU SAID HE COULD DROP DEAD
IF HE DOES.
IS THERE A CHANCE? YES.
BUT IS IT GREATER

11:28.792 --> 11:30.792
THAN THE CHANCE HE COULD GET
INTO AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT

11:30.834 --> 11:33.250
ON THE WAY TO THE MEET?
GIVEN THAT HIS ONLY SYMPTOMS

11:33.291 --> 11:36.959
ARE A LITTLE DIZZINESS,
PROBABLY NOT.
SO YOU'D LET HIM WRESTLE?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.959
I MEAN, IF HIS WHOLE FUTURE
DEPENDS ON IT,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.375
IT'S--IT'S A CALCULATED RISK.
WELL, I MEAN,

11:41.417 --> 11:44.125
YOU NEVER TAKE RISKS
WITH KIDS' LIVES, SAM, EVER.

11:44.166 --> 11:47.166
WELL, THAT'S NOT
THE WAY IT WORKS.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.792
YOU DON'T THINK I WANTED
TO LOCK MAYA IN THE HOUSE

11:49.834 --> 11:53.000
AND NOT LET HER RIDE A BIKE
OR DRIVE A CAR OR SKI?

11:53.041 --> 11:54.375
NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

11:54.417 --> 11:56.375
YOU CAN'T ELIMINATE
ALL RISK IN LIFE.

11:56.417 --> 12:00.291
AND GIVEN WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
THIS KID HAS AT STAKE...

12:03.083 --> 12:06.083
(Pete) I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.041
LORRAINE AND ELLIOT HAVE BEEN
MARRIED FOR WHAT, EIGHT YEARS?

12:09.083 --> 12:11.375
YOU UNDERSTAND IT.
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE IT.

12:11.417 --> 12:14.041
YEAH. IT'S JUST--LIFE ISN'T
A CHEAP ROMANCE NOVEL, YOU KNOW?

12:14.083 --> 12:17.041
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT MAKING
A COMMITMENT AND HONORING IT.

12:17.083 --> 12:19.667
SOMETIMES. AND OTHER TIMES,
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,

12:19.709 --> 12:21.583
IT'S ABOUT PASSION.

12:21.625 --> 12:23.834
YOU THINK PASSION
IS ENOUGH?

12:23.875 --> 12:26.041
YOU DON'T?

12:26.083 --> 12:28.667
TO MAKE AN ADULT RELATIONSHIP
WORK, YOU NEED MORE.

12:28.709 --> 12:30.667
COME ON. YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT CLAUDINE AND ELLIOT

12:30.709 --> 12:32.667
LIKE THEY'RE
SOME INSUBSTANTIAL FLING.

12:32.709 --> 12:35.458
I MEAN, THEY'RE BOTH GROWN-UPS
WHO ARE TAKING A RISK--

12:35.500 --> 12:38.208
A HUGE RISK--

12:38.250 --> 12:40.417
BECAUSE THEY FOUND EACH OTHER
AND FELL IN LOVE.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.834
JUST BECAUSE A RISK IS BIG
DOESN'T MAKE IT WORTHWHILE.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.834
I FEEL FOR LORRAINE.
OF COURSE I DO.

12:44.875 --> 12:48.291
BUT ON SOME LEVEL, I MEAN,
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S BRAVE,

12:48.333 --> 12:50.750
WHAT ELLIOT AND CLAUDINE
WANT TO DO?

12:50.792 --> 12:54.041
MM. MNH-MNH. STOP LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT, PETE.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.041
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
SAM AND ME.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.417
OF COURSE IT IS.

12:57.458 --> 13:00.417
SAM AND I TOLD NAOMI
THAT WE WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

13:00.458 --> 13:03.333
OKAY. (sighs)
WHO'S GONNA TELL LORRAINE?

13:03.375 --> 13:05.375
(sighs)

13:07.583 --> 13:10.500
(indistinct conversations)

13:10.542 --> 13:12.709
OKAY, CLAUDINE.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.750
YOU'RE IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES
OF LABOR.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.250
YOU'RE JUST
3 CENTIMETERS DILATED.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.250
SO YOU'RE
GONNA BE HERE A WHILE.

13:19.291 --> 13:22.458
I WILL CALL YOUR REGULAR
OB-GYN.
NO, MY O.B.'s GONE ALL WEEK.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.083
AND I DON'T KNOW THE WOMAN
WHO'S ON CALL FOR HER.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.083
CAN'T YOU DO IT?

13:27.125 --> 13:30.500
OKAY, BUT--
AND MAYBE YOU COULD
CALL LORRAINE.

13:30.542 --> 13:32.375
SHE'S SO EXCITED.
NO.

13:32.417 --> 13:34.792
I THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD CALL LORRAINE.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.166
IF YOU MEAN WE SHOULD
TELL HER, I CAN'T.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.875
WE CAN'T. NOT--NOT YET.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.792
DON'T YOU THINK THAT SHE
HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW?

13:42.834 --> 13:45.417
YOU KNOW I LOVE LORRAINE,
RIGHT?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.709
AND I'D DO ANYTHING FOR HER.

13:47.750 --> 13:50.125
I MEAN, I AM.
I'M DOING THIS.

13:50.166 --> 13:51.750
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:51.792 --> 13:55.125
EVER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE,
LORRAINE WANTED TO BE A MOM.

13:55.166 --> 13:58.291
SHE JUST... SHE KNEW.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.041
I NEVER DID.

14:01.083 --> 14:04.208
MAYBE IT WAS TOO MANY
PRINCESS MOVIES GROWING UP,

14:04.250 --> 14:05.834
BUT ME?

14:05.875 --> 14:08.041
I ONLY
WANTED TO FALL IN LOVE.

14:08.083 --> 14:12.750
(chuckles) WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHY IT NEVER HAPPENED FOR ME.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.959
AND THEN THERE WAS ELLIOT.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.375
(clears throat)

14:17.417 --> 14:20.375
AT FIRST, HE WAS JUST
MY BIG SISTER'S BOYFRIEND,

14:20.417 --> 14:25.125
WHO... I MOSTLY RESENTED
FOR TAKING HER AWAY FROM ME.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.959
BUT ONCE MY SISTER GOT SICK

14:29.000 --> 14:32.208
AND WE REALLY
GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

14:32.250 --> 14:34.041
SOMETHING HAPPENED,

14:34.083 --> 14:37.583
SOMETHING... AMAZING.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.792
AND THE MORE WE TRIED
TO HOLD BACK,

14:39.834 --> 14:41.792
THE HARDER IT GOT,

14:41.834 --> 14:43.166
UNTIL...

14:43.208 --> 14:45.041
(sighs)

14:45.083 --> 14:47.417
I LOVE LORRAINE,
DR. MONTGOMERY.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.417
I DO,
AND I ALWAYS WILL,

14:49.458 --> 14:54.041
BUT NOW, ESPECIALLY SINCE
I'M CARRYING ELLIOT'S BABY--

14:54.083 --> 14:55.458
OKAY, STOP, CLAUDINE.
ALL RIGHT?

14:55.500 --> 14:58.041
JUST THINK ABOUT THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

14:58.083 --> 15:01.041
YOU'RE PREGNANT. YOUR HORMONES
ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.375
THEY CAN OVERWHELM YOU,
AND--
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS.

15:03.417 --> 15:06.041
I MEAN, I WISH IT WAS.
BELIEVE ME.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.041
BUT... REAL LOVE

15:08.083 --> 15:11.250
CAN'T BE CONFUSED
WITH ANYTHING ELSE.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.000
THEN TELL YOUR SISTER THAT.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.041
I UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU CAN'T CHOOSE

15:15.083 --> 15:17.041
WHO YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.291
BUT YOU CAN CHOOSE
TO BE HONEST.

15:19.333 --> 15:23.166
(beeping continues)

15:23.208 --> 15:25.917
I REVIEWED YOUR SCAN
WITH A HEART SPECIALIST,

15:25.959 --> 15:28.917
AND AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE
FOR YOU TO COMPETE AND TO WIN,

15:28.959 --> 15:31.959
I CAN'T LET YOU TAKE
THAT RISK.
(Tyler) BUT I-I FEEL FINE.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.875
I CAN WRESTLE.
I HAVE TO WRESTLE.

15:34.917 --> 15:38.417
IT'S JUST, TYLER HAS WORKED
SO HARD, AND THIS IS HIS DREAM.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.041
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

15:40.083 --> 15:42.125
A POTENTIALLY
FATAL PROBLEM HERE.
WHAT ARE THE ODDS

15:42.166 --> 15:44.542
THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS TO
TYLER--10 TO 1, 100 TO 1, WHAT?

15:44.583 --> 15:47.625
I CAN'T GIVE YOU ODDS.
THEN WHY SHOULD WE LISTEN
TO YOU?

15:47.667 --> 15:49.291
LOOK,
I KNOW MY OWN BODY.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.041
I HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING DIZZY.
I'M--I'M FEELING GREAT.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.709
I CAN MAKE WEIGHT.
YOU'RE WAY OUT OF LINE HERE.
WE'RE HIS PARENTS,

15:54.750 --> 15:56.959
AND WE SAY WHAT HE CAN
OR CAN'T DO, NOT YOU.
EXCEPT THAT YOU NEED
MY SIGNATURE

15:57.000 --> 15:59.250
ON TYLER'S
MEDICAL RELEASE FORM.
WE'LL GET ANOTHER DOCTOR.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.166
RANDY.
I'M SAYING TYLER COULD DIE.

16:01.208 --> 16:03.417
WHAT ABOUT THAT
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:05.333 --> 16:08.041
I'M SORRY, BUT FINALS AREN'T
GONNA HAPPEN FOR YOU, TYLER.

16:08.083 --> 16:11.083
LET'S GO. NOW, TYLER.

16:27.125 --> 16:30.000
(knock on door)
DR. FREEDMAN.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.834
HEY, TYLER.

16:31.875 --> 16:34.041
COME IN.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.750
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:35.792 --> 16:38.041
NOTHING IS OKAY.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.125
UH...

16:40.166 --> 16:42.959
MY MOM GOT LAID OFF
LAST YEAR.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.792
MY DAD IS WORKING DOUBLE SHIFTS
JUST TO PAY THE RENT.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.792
I HAVE A PART-TIME JOB
ON THE WEEKENDS--

16:48.834 --> 16:50.375
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND. I DO.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.792
NO, YOU DON'T.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.000
LOOK, I'M THE ONLY ONE
IN MY FAMILY

16:55.041 --> 16:57.041
WITH THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.166
WITHOUT A SCHOLARSHIP,
I'M JUST GONNA END UP

16:59.208 --> 17:01.375
DOING THE SAME THING
MY PARENTS ARE.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

17:01.417 --> 17:03.625
JUST LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW
SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO ME

17:03.667 --> 17:06.041
IF I WRESTLE TOMORROW.
I CAN'T LET YOU
TAKE THAT RISK.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.458
BUT THAT'S MY DECISION.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.959
SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU ARE
SO CLOSE TO A SITUATION...
(sighs)

17:10.000 --> 17:12.333
YOU CAN'T SEE IT--
YOU CAN'T SEE IT CLEARLY.

17:12.375 --> 17:15.333
AND I'M TELLING YOU--
STOP. JUST STOP
TELLING ME THINGS

17:15.375 --> 17:17.583
A-AND JUST HELP ME.

17:19.083 --> 17:22.125
I THINK I AM, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE IT TO YOU.
YOU'RE NOT.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.750
BUT I-I-TH--I THINK I AM,
OKAY?
YOU'RE NOT.

17:24.792 --> 17:27.041
I MADE A CARDIAC M.R.I.
APPOINTMENT FOR YOU TOMORROW,

17:27.083 --> 17:29.041
AND I LEFT WORD
FOR YOUR FOLKS,

17:29.083 --> 17:33.041
I EXPECT TO SEE YOU THERE.
IT'S THE FIRST STEP.
YOU'RE SCARED TO TAKE A RISK.

17:33.083 --> 17:35.875
I'M NOT.

17:35.917 --> 17:38.041
BUT YOU ARE.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.917

YOU'RE DOING THIS.
