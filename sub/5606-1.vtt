That is

12:09.952 --> 12:12.886
a box for a Betamax tape,
not VHS.

12:12.888 --> 12:15.221
VHS is actually eight
percent larger than Betas.

12:15.223 --> 12:17.690
Incidentally, they were
inferior in every way.

12:17.692 --> 12:19.459

picture, better sound.

12:19.461 --> 12:20.693

12:22.364 --> 12:24.397

No.

12:36.943 --> 12:39.645
Okay, so, can we, uh...
can we get back to Washburn?

12:39.647 --> 12:41.413
So, the guy's name appears

12:41.415 --> 12:43.815
on a publisher's press release
from back in 1975.

12:43.817 --> 12:45.317
Seems a local

12:45.319 --> 12:48.386
history teacher
named Dr. Nathan Exley

12:48.388 --> 12:50.754
was writing a book about a band

12:50.756 --> 12:52.856
<i>of pirates operating</i>
<i>in the Pacific</i>

12:52.858 --> 12:55.626
<i>during the early 1880s,</i>
<i>and Washburn</i>

12:55.628 --> 12:57.961
<i>was the last surviving member</i>
<i>of the crew.</i>

12:57.963 --> 12:59.830
Still had pirates
in the 1880s?

12:59.832 --> 13:02.233
Actually, you know, I remember
hearing about these guys

13:02.235 --> 13:04.134
when I was a kid. My uncle

13:04.136 --> 13:06.536
used to tell me
a bedtime story

13:06.538 --> 13:09.573
about this crew launching
a midnight raid on Oahu.

13:09.575 --> 13:12.875
Legend has it that they laid
siege to the island for hours

13:12.877 --> 13:15.212
<i>before escaping with a treasure</i>
<i>worth millions.</i>

13:15.214 --> 13:16.813
It's a fine haul, gents.

13:16.815 --> 13:18.615
Fine haul indeed.

13:18.617 --> 13:20.149
Of course that's just folklore.

13:20.151 --> 13:22.651
Hardly anyone believes
that they actually were here.

13:22.653 --> 13:24.186
But back in the day,

13:24.188 --> 13:26.288
these pirates actually did hit
dozens of islands,

13:26.290 --> 13:27.989
and they amassed
a huge treasure.

13:27.991 --> 13:29.525
The press release also says

13:29.527 --> 13:32.328
that Nathan Exley conducted
a series of video interviews

13:32.330 --> 13:35.063
<i>with Washburn,</i>
<i>who at the time</i>

13:35.065 --> 13:37.099
was 104 years old.

13:37.101 --> 13:38.799
Most of this treasure
wasn't recovered,

13:38.801 --> 13:41.402
so it's safe to assume
a lot of it's still out there.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.938
Maybe Washburn, on this tape,
said something that could lead

13:43.940 --> 13:45.005
to the rest of it.

13:45.007 --> 13:46.207
Okay, well,
that would definitely

13:46.209 --> 13:47.508
be information
worth killing for.

13:47.510 --> 13:48.943
All right, so let's just
talk to Exley

13:48.945 --> 13:50.311
and see what
Washburn told him.

13:50.313 --> 13:51.446
Unfortunately, we can't.

13:51.448 --> 13:52.680
Why not?

13:52.682 --> 13:54.249
Because dead men tell no tales.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.882
Would you stop with the thing?

13:55.884 --> 13:56.950
I'm sorry. It was right there.

13:56.952 --> 13:58.585
Oh, hold on a second.
Exley's dead?

13:58.587 --> 14:00.220
Presumably.

14:00.222 --> 14:02.356
He vanished right
after he started

14:02.358 --> 14:04.458
working on his book
40 years ago.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.326
Meanwhile, all of his research,

14:06.328 --> 14:08.895
including the Washburn tapes,
ended up in a storage container,

14:08.897 --> 14:11.265
where it remained untouched
for years.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.666
Now, Exley's family kept paying
the tab for that container,

14:13.668 --> 14:15.334
hoping he might come back
someday.

14:15.336 --> 14:17.169
He never did.
Eventually they gave up,

14:17.171 --> 14:19.739
and then, just a few
weeks ago, that container

14:19.741 --> 14:21.874
ended up being sold at an auction.
GROVER: And that's

14:21.876 --> 14:23.208
where the Vic comes in.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.744
Keanu bought that container,

14:24.746 --> 14:25.878
and we think it's because

14:25.880 --> 14:28.046
he was writing a book
on Dr. Nathan Exley.

14:28.048 --> 14:29.681
Whatever info
that pirate shared with Exley,

14:29.683 --> 14:31.115
chances are
he told somebody else.

14:31.117 --> 14:33.184
So let's find out
whatever we can, reach out

14:33.186 --> 14:35.687
to any known family members,
see if they know something.

14:41.059 --> 14:43.027
Some party last night.

14:43.029 --> 14:44.996
Epic. Epic party.

14:44.998 --> 14:46.497
You know, me and
Catherine-- we passed out

14:46.499 --> 14:47.831
as soon as we
walked in the door.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.099
I woke up in my tux.

14:49.101 --> 14:51.735
So, I take it that means
you did not have the talk?

14:51.737 --> 14:53.537
What talk?
What talk? What are you...?

14:53.539 --> 14:55.472
The talk. We talked
about the talk.

14:55.474 --> 14:57.374
Remember? "How long you staying?
What are your plans?

14:57.376 --> 14:58.648
What's going on with you and I?"
The talk.

14:58.672 --> 14:59.242
Oh, the talk.

14:59.244 --> 15:01.077
Yeah.
Yeah. No, we didn't have the talk.

15:01.079 --> 15:02.513
I didn't get around to it.
Well, if

15:02.515 --> 15:04.414
you'd like me to Cyrano that
conversation, I can do that.

15:04.416 --> 15:06.349
You know, you just tell me when
and where, and I'll be there.

15:06.351 --> 15:08.150
Thank you. It's fine.
I got this.

15:08.152 --> 15:10.186
We'll, uh...
we'll have the talk.

15:10.188 --> 15:12.755
You know, if you're scared,
I can understand that.

15:12.757 --> 15:15.391
It's-it's okay to be scared.
You can admit that to me.

15:15.393 --> 15:17.360
Why would I admit that when
I'm not scared? I'm not scared.

15:17.362 --> 15:18.728
You're not?
No.

15:18.730 --> 15:19.895
No, 'cause I understand
that you're a Navy SEAL,

15:19.897 --> 15:21.963
and being fragile is not
something you are allowed to be,

15:21.965 --> 15:23.965
being a Navy SEAL, so, you know,

15:23.967 --> 15:26.034
if she hurt you once
pretty good, I imagine

15:26.036 --> 15:27.436
she... well, she might do it
again. That's understandable.

15:27.438 --> 15:28.503
Hey, listen to me for a second.

15:28.505 --> 15:29.771
Listen, I appreciate
your advice.

15:29.773 --> 15:30.939
I know you're trying
to do me a favor,

15:30.941 --> 15:33.141
but could you please,
please just stop talking?

15:33.143 --> 15:35.977
That's all, just... you know?
Okay.

15:35.979 --> 15:37.578
You want to be alone,
you want to be

15:37.580 --> 15:39.480
miserable for the rest of
your life, don't listen to me.

15:39.482 --> 15:42.316
You are alone and you
are always miserable,

15:42.318 --> 15:44.017
and-and that
is exactly why

15:44.019 --> 15:45.553
I'm not listening to you, okay?

15:45.555 --> 15:47.822
And that's also why I'm gonna
ask Catherine to marry me.

15:47.824 --> 15:50.725
Say that again.

15:50.727 --> 15:52.360
I said you're
always miserable.

15:52.362 --> 15:53.728
The other part!

15:53.730 --> 15:55.628
I'm gonna ask
Catherine to marry me.

15:55.630 --> 15:57.597
Well, it is about time.

15:57.599 --> 15:59.499
I agree with you.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.134
It's, uh, something I should
have done a long time ago.

16:02.136 --> 16:03.737
I am very proud of you, buddy.

16:03.739 --> 16:07.173
Thank you.
This is fantastic, huh?

16:07.175 --> 16:08.508
Look at this. See this?

16:08.510 --> 16:10.042
This is me not miserable.

16:10.044 --> 16:11.977
I am happy right now for you.

16:11.979 --> 16:13.545
Give it time.
It'll pass, I'm sure.

16:13.547 --> 16:14.813
Hey, buddy, that's great!

16:14.815 --> 16:16.715
Hey, hey, I'm driving here.
What, are you crazy?!

16:16.717 --> 16:19.084
Yeah, it's good. Wow.

16:19.086 --> 16:22.721
I'm picking the tuxes.
Fine.

16:25.291 --> 16:28.059
(blows landing)

16:28.061 --> 16:30.728
Stop it!

16:30.730 --> 16:32.062
Nice of you to join us.

16:32.064 --> 16:33.731
Let him go.

16:33.733 --> 16:35.867
Please.

16:35.869 --> 16:38.035
He's done
nothing to you.

16:38.037 --> 16:39.169
(grunting)

16:39.171 --> 16:40.471
What do you
want from him?!

16:40.473 --> 16:42.440
(sighs, coughs)

16:42.442 --> 16:45.309
She's a little late
to the party.

16:45.311 --> 16:48.612
You catch her up?

16:50.114 --> 16:51.782
(Adam panting)

16:51.784 --> 16:53.950
Gabriel wants me
to transfer all my assets

16:53.952 --> 16:56.286
to a holding company
he controls.

16:56.288 --> 16:57.921
GABRIEL:
Shouldn't be difficult, right?

16:57.923 --> 16:59.355
He was scheduled to transfer

16:59.357 --> 17:01.591
all that cash to his father's
ex-partner in three days.

17:01.593 --> 17:05.160
I'm just asking him
to move that money now.

17:05.162 --> 17:07.630
If he does that,
the Yakuza will kill him.

17:07.632 --> 17:11.634
If he doesn't,
what do you think I'll do?

17:13.603 --> 17:18.106
STEVE: <i>Doctor, when was the last time</i>
<i>you spoke to your boyfriend?</i>

17:18.108 --> 17:19.941
A few days ago.

17:19.943 --> 17:21.342
Keanu was in research mode,

17:21.344 --> 17:23.611
gearing up
to write his new book.

17:23.613 --> 17:25.413
Whenever
he started something new,

17:25.415 --> 17:27.848
it was best just
to leave him be.

17:27.851 --> 17:30.117
You know, Keanu very recently--
he bought a, um...

17:30.119 --> 17:31.519
a storage container, uh,

17:31.521 --> 17:33.755
belonged to a guy
named Nathan Exley.

17:33.757 --> 17:35.189
Do you know
anything about that?

17:35.191 --> 17:37.558
Of course. That's who Keanu
was writing about.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.193
The container had all
of Exley's research-- papers,

17:40.195 --> 17:41.829
tapes,

17:41.831 --> 17:43.497
his whole life's work, really.

17:43.499 --> 17:46.567
He was like
this real-life Indiana Jones.

17:46.569 --> 17:48.435
I told Keanu
I thought Exley may have

17:48.437 --> 17:50.337
gone off in search
of pirate treasure.

17:50.339 --> 17:51.905
I figured he probably

17:51.907 --> 17:54.740
died in the field or maybe
at the hands of a competitor.

17:54.742 --> 17:56.576
Keanu was intrigued.

17:56.578 --> 17:58.177
Thought there was a story there.

17:58.179 --> 17:59.679
(sniffles)

17:59.681 --> 18:01.380
So when that container
became available,

18:01.382 --> 18:03.983
Keanu jumped at it.

18:03.985 --> 18:06.819
STEVE: Ma'am, there were
some videotapes

18:06.821 --> 18:08.220
in the container
among Exley's work,

18:08.222 --> 18:11.055
one of which had an interview
with a man named Byron Washburn.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.357
Did Keanu ever mention

18:12.359 --> 18:13.592
anything about that?

18:13.594 --> 18:16.027
Yeah, but he didn't say
what was on it.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.363
He was really excited
about it, though.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.631
(sniffles,
phone beeps on)

18:19.633 --> 18:22.801
Ah, he even left me a message
after he watched it.

18:22.803 --> 18:24.736
KEANU:
Baby, it's me.

18:24.738 --> 18:26.237
You were right
about this professor.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.338
I don't care
if this book sells or not.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.840
We're gonna be rich.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.275
Thank you.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.879
Okay, from the sound
of that voice mail,

18:34.881 --> 18:37.481
Keanu got hit with the same
treasure-hunting bug as Exley.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.350
Right, which means that old sea
dog Washburn had to have said

18:40.352 --> 18:41.952
something
about a missing fortune.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.787
Clues, maybe a location even.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.656
All right, look, buddy, I do
not know what's stranger, okay?

18:46.658 --> 18:49.959
Somewhere out there there's a
130-year-old pirate treasure

18:49.961 --> 18:51.427
that we're looking for,

18:51.429 --> 18:54.564
or that the key to finding it is
on a 40-year-old Betamax tape.

18:54.566 --> 18:55.965
Whatever the case may be,

18:55.967 --> 19:00.202
whoever's after that treasure
is willing to kill for it now.

19:00.204 --> 19:02.303
(alarm sounding)
TOUR GUIDE: Ladies and gentlemen, we've had

19:02.305 --> 19:04.673
a report of a gas leak.
Please use any

19:04.675 --> 19:06.207
available exit.

19:06.209 --> 19:08.043
Let's go.

19:08.045 --> 19:09.077
That's right, come on.

19:09.079 --> 19:11.212
Keep moving.

19:13.249 --> 19:15.450
(alarm continues blaring)

19:25.994 --> 19:28.162
GUARD:
Hold it right there!

19:28.164 --> 19:29.463
Put the painting down.

19:29.465 --> 19:32.867
Place your hands
on your head.

19:32.869 --> 19:36.102
That's right, keep your
hands where I can see them.

19:36.104 --> 19:37.604
(gasps)

19:37.606 --> 19:38.872
MAN:
Leave now.

19:38.874 --> 19:40.707
(gun chamber cocks)

19:48.894 --> 19:53.030
(tires screeching,
sirens blaring)

20:00.704 --> 20:04.073
(sirens blaring)

20:05.608 --> 20:06.508
Lou, what have we got?

20:06.510 --> 20:07.342
Hostage situation.

20:07.344 --> 20:08.376
GROVER:
Somebody calls in

20:08.378 --> 20:09.477
a phony gas leak.

20:10.002 --> 20:12.403
They tried
to evacuate the building.

20:12.405 --> 20:13.871
All of a sudden,
one of the security guards says

20:13.873 --> 20:15.573
this guy wearing
a gas company uniform

20:15.575 --> 20:17.542
trying to steal a painting.

20:17.544 --> 20:19.709
Must be
a very valuable painting.

20:19.711 --> 20:21.278
Well, it belonged to King
Kalakaua, so it's priceless.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.446
You know, I'm starting to think

20:22.448 --> 20:23.680
this was about more
than just an art theft, though.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.014
What do you mean?
Remember that

20:25.016 --> 20:26.683
bedtime story I was telling you
that my uncle told me?

20:26.685 --> 20:27.250
Sure.

20:27.274 --> 20:29.274
In it, the pirates
storm 'Iolani Palace.

20:29.321 --> 20:30.954
<i>And they steal anything</i>
<i>of value, including</i>

20:30.956 --> 20:32.589
<i>a painting of Manoa Valley.</i>

20:32.591 --> 20:34.391
Now the painting our perp
tried to steal?

20:34.393 --> 20:36.125
<i>Also of Manoa Valley.</i>

20:36.127 --> 20:37.560
Now, according
to the museum director,

20:37.562 --> 20:39.228
this particular painting
disappeared from the palace

20:39.230 --> 20:41.482
in 1884, and it only resurfaced

20:41.506 --> 20:42.732
40 years ago in the basement
of an old church.

20:42.733 --> 20:44.967
So, you're saying
it could be the same painting.

20:44.969 --> 20:46.969
I thought you said that your
uncle's story was just a legend.

20:46.971 --> 20:49.037
What if it isn't?

20:49.039 --> 20:50.772
GROVER:
Look, whatever it is,

20:50.774 --> 20:52.707
here's the bottom line.
We got a killer

20:52.709 --> 20:54.008
looking for some
19th century treasure.

20:54.010 --> 20:55.243
Then, all of a sudden,

20:55.245 --> 20:57.145
somebody tries
to rip off a painting

20:57.147 --> 20:59.847
that may or may not be
connected to the same treasure?

20:59.849 --> 21:01.516
This ain't a coincidence.

21:01.518 --> 21:04.352
Our homicide and this
attempted theft are connected.

21:05.154 --> 21:07.155
All right,
we had any communication

21:07.157 --> 21:09.023
with the perp?
Nothing so far.

21:10.725 --> 21:12.659
Tac up. We're going in.

21:22.937 --> 21:25.205
Clear. - Clear.
- Clear.

21:25.973 --> 21:27.440
Clear.
Clear.

21:27.442 --> 21:28.741
Clear.
Clear.

21:28.743 --> 21:31.076
So, where is this guy?

21:31.078 --> 21:33.513
All right, this level has
three possible exfil points.

21:33.515 --> 21:35.114
Maybe he grabbed his hostage

21:35.116 --> 21:36.849
and slipped out
before backup arrived.

21:36.851 --> 21:38.751
Yeah,
but that doesn't make any sense.

21:38.753 --> 21:40.253
He already got away
with the painting.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.987
What the hell
you gonna take a hostage for?

21:53.032 --> 21:55.500
This is good.

21:55.502 --> 21:56.868
What is it?

21:56.870 --> 21:57.935
It's quiche.

21:57.937 --> 22:00.737
Tastes like eggs.

22:07.579 --> 22:08.912
(grunts)

22:11.316 --> 22:14.718
(sniffs, grunts)
What do you say?

22:14.720 --> 22:17.420
What you're asking me to do
is not possible.

22:17.422 --> 22:19.589
I told you that.
Adam, I'm trying

22:19.591 --> 22:21.324
to be professional about this.

22:21.326 --> 22:25.195
There's absolutely no need
for anybody else to get hurt.

22:27.698 --> 22:29.399
Now, all you have
to do

22:29.401 --> 22:31.967
is give my friend Damon
here the account codes.

22:31.969 --> 22:34.136
We'll do
the rest.

22:35.572 --> 22:37.772
No.

22:43.079 --> 22:44.279
KONO (muffled):
Adam.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.880
(muffled protests)

22:47.350 --> 22:48.183
(groans)

22:48.185 --> 22:49.451
(doorbell rings)

22:53.589 --> 22:54.622
(doorbell rings)

22:54.624 --> 22:55.823
It's for me.

22:57.193 --> 22:59.426
(groans)

23:11.841 --> 23:13.908
(exhales)

23:15.378 --> 23:18.479
GROVER: <i>Pulled security footage</i>
<i>from the heist</i>

23:18.481 --> 23:20.648
and ran our thief
through facial rec.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.149
Didn't get any hits
on the guy

23:22.151 --> 23:24.385
but we did get one back
on his hostage.

23:24.387 --> 23:26.921
Hostage?
More like a co-conspirator.

23:26.923 --> 23:28.022
The girl's in on it.

23:28.024 --> 23:29.924
Guys, meet

23:29.926 --> 23:31.725
Miss Cindy Patterson.
She lives in Key West.

23:31.727 --> 23:33.494
She's got
a nice little record

23:33.496 --> 23:35.563
for boat theft
and armed robbery,

23:35.565 --> 23:37.398
and, according to the
paper the FBI has on her,

23:37.400 --> 23:40.134
she likes to run with an
unidentified accomplice

23:40.136 --> 23:42.469
who just so happens to fit
the same description as our guy.

23:42.471 --> 23:45.873
Okay. So Patterson hides out
in the museum somewhere while

23:45.875 --> 23:47.875
her partner jacks
the painting.

23:47.877 --> 23:49.810
The security guard catches him
in the act, so she calls

23:49.812 --> 23:52.513
an audible and pretends
to be an innocent bystander.

23:52.515 --> 23:53.814
JERRY:
Well,

23:53.816 --> 23:55.216
I did it again.

23:55.218 --> 23:56.083
DANNY:
What'd you do?

23:56.085 --> 23:59.119
I think I blew this case
wide open.

23:59.121 --> 24:02.356
Excuse me.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.924
Well, are you gonna tell us what
you did or are you gonna break

24:03.926 --> 24:05.593
your arm, patting
yourself on the back?

24:05.595 --> 24:09.163
Your stolen painting
is a treasure map.

24:09.165 --> 24:12.233
I'm almost sure of
it. Check this out.

24:12.235 --> 24:14.401
Here's the painting
as it looked when it hung

24:14.403 --> 24:16.670
in the palace,
shortly before it disappeared.

24:16.672 --> 24:19.440
And here is how it looked

24:19.442 --> 24:21.442
when it was recovered
40 years ago.

24:21.444 --> 24:22.710
Note...

24:22.712 --> 24:24.812
the tear
in the canvas.

24:24.814 --> 24:26.180
Now, if you believe
the pirate raid

24:26.182 --> 24:27.548
actually happened--

24:27.550 --> 24:29.617
and I think we're all on board
with that now--

24:29.619 --> 24:31.151
then this
damage occurred

24:31.153 --> 24:33.287
while the painting was
in the hands of the crew.

24:33.289 --> 24:34.588
Obviously, it could
have been an accident,

24:34.590 --> 24:37.391
but there is
also another possibility:

24:37.393 --> 24:39.293
the pirates did this on purpose.

24:39.295 --> 24:40.861
See,
I'm thinking,

24:40.863 --> 24:43.230
after they pillaged Oahu,
something happened

24:43.232 --> 24:45.799
which forced 'em to hide
the treasure here on the island.

24:45.801 --> 24:48.235
Maybe the Army was after them.
Who knows?

24:48.237 --> 24:50.070
I think they stashed
the treasure with the intention

24:50.072 --> 24:51.605
of coming back for it later.

24:51.607 --> 24:53.440
Except they didn't have time
to draw a treasure map,

24:53.442 --> 24:55.776
so instead they made
this painting the map.

24:55.778 --> 24:57.945
See, all they had to do

24:57.947 --> 24:59.246
was pick a spot in the painting,

24:59.248 --> 25:02.583
bury the treasure there,
and then mark the canvas.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.917
It's pretty
nifty, right?

25:03.919 --> 25:05.786
It's a total pirate move.
This is like

25:05.788 --> 25:08.255
waiting in line for
a <i> Star Wars</i> movie for you, huh?

25:08.257 --> 25:10.024
Yeah. Kind of.

25:10.026 --> 25:11.091
Anyway,

25:11.093 --> 25:12.493
taking into consideration

25:12.495 --> 25:15.262
a century's worth of foliage
growth and terrain shifts,

25:15.264 --> 25:17.498
I've managed to pinpoint
the location of the treasure.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.868
There. Just east
of Lua'alaea Falls.

25:20.870 --> 25:22.936
That's where your booty is.
Ergo, that's where

25:22.938 --> 25:25.873
your bad guys
are headed.

25:25.875 --> 25:30.678
You do realize that this theory
of yours is completely...

25:30.680 --> 25:33.080
Ridiculous.
GROVER: Damn right.

25:33.082 --> 25:35.349
Jerry, if the
painting is the map,

25:35.351 --> 25:37.584
why not just go to the
museum, pull out your phone,

25:37.586 --> 25:39.486
take a picture of
the damn painting?

25:39.488 --> 25:40.587
Got a point, Jerry.

25:40.589 --> 25:42.189
Your ignorance is adorable.

25:42.191 --> 25:42.972
What?

25:42.996 --> 25:45.013
You're thinking of these perps
as thieves.

25:45.194 --> 25:46.727
They're not thieves.

25:46.729 --> 25:48.896
They steal boats
and chase treasure.

25:48.898 --> 25:50.130
They're pirates.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.232
And pirates pillage
as they go.

25:52.234 --> 25:53.467
It's what they do.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.803
"Take it all.
Leave nothing behind."

25:55.805 --> 25:57.171
That's their
mantra.

25:57.173 --> 25:59.973
This painting belonged
to King Kalakaua himself.

25:59.975 --> 26:03.077
It's priceless. There's no way
they'd leave that behind.

26:03.079 --> 26:07.047
Guys, have I ever
steered you wrong before?

26:07.049 --> 26:10.150
Trust me.
Thar be treasure in that spot.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.420
Yo ho ho.

26:13.422 --> 26:16.290
♪ ♪

26:26.302 --> 26:28.168
Are we there yet?

26:28.170 --> 26:32.639
Well, according to Jerry, it
should be right over this ridge.

26:32.641 --> 26:34.708
I'm just gonna
keep it real, man.

26:34.710 --> 26:36.577
If these perps are up here,
I'm gonna be way too damn tired

26:36.579 --> 26:37.678
to arrest 'em.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.213
We could just shoot the guy
when we get there.

26:39.215 --> 26:40.981
Steve, you're good with that, right?
Yeah, you children

26:40.983 --> 26:42.416
done complaining yet
or what?

26:42.418 --> 26:43.751
Anybody got any bug spray?
I'm getting eaten alive

26:43.753 --> 26:46.553
out here.
Speaking about being eaten alive,

26:46.555 --> 26:48.422
Steve has something that
he would like to share

26:48.424 --> 26:51.024
with everybody, with the group.
I hope it's bug spray.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.960
Danny. Come on. Really?

26:52.962 --> 26:53.534
You should share it.

26:53.558 --> 26:54.562
He's getting married.
(groans)

26:54.563 --> 26:56.063
What?
Hey. - Huh?

26:56.065 --> 26:58.532
(laughing):
Huh?

26:58.534 --> 27:01.301
Yes, I was gonna propose

27:01.303 --> 27:04.505
to Catherine, unless,
of course, Big Mouth here

27:04.507 --> 27:06.306
already blew the surprise.
Well, that's

27:06.308 --> 27:07.941
great news.
Yeah, mazel tov, brother.

27:07.943 --> 27:09.176
Thank you.

27:09.178 --> 27:10.244
When's the big day?

27:10.246 --> 27:11.245
I don't know.
I got to...

27:11.247 --> 27:12.212
I got to get a ring

27:12.214 --> 27:13.313
and find a location.
But soon.

27:13.315 --> 27:14.281
Look, I asked Rachel to marry me

27:14.283 --> 27:15.582
with a soda can ring.

27:15.584 --> 27:17.618
I think we all remember
how that worked out.

27:17.620 --> 27:20.587
Hey, listen, she was,
uh, very surprised.

27:20.589 --> 27:22.589
It was very romantic.
I bet it was.

27:22.591 --> 27:24.725
It's a nice story, Danny, but I
want to do this right, you know?

27:24.727 --> 27:26.093
It's been a long time coming,
so...

27:26.095 --> 27:30.864
You know, not that yours
wasn't right, but...

27:30.866 --> 27:32.199
Well, if you're gonna
do it, do it right.

27:32.201 --> 27:34.034
STEVE:
I appreciate it.

27:35.137 --> 27:36.236
Guys,

27:36.238 --> 27:37.571
over here!

27:44.914 --> 27:47.648
All right,

27:47.650 --> 27:50.884
I'll guard the entrance.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.186
Seriously?

27:52.188 --> 27:54.421
Claustrophobia
does not go away.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.590
Good luck, guys.

28:02.331 --> 28:04.531
Over here.

28:11.941 --> 28:15.042
GROVER: Yeah, he's definitely
been here a while.

28:15.044 --> 28:16.577
You guys,
looks like we just solved

28:16.579 --> 28:18.712
the mysterious disappearance
of Professor Exley.

28:31.312 --> 28:33.512
(indistinct chatter)

28:39.019 --> 28:41.186
(indistinct police transmission)

28:42.957 --> 28:44.923
STEVE: Hey, guys.
Check this out.

28:44.925 --> 28:47.559
According to Exley's journal,
the pirate captain was afraid

28:47.561 --> 28:50.195
there was gonna be a mutiny
when they got out to sea.

28:50.197 --> 28:51.430
<i>He figured</i>
<i>he needed some leverage,</i>

28:51.432 --> 28:52.698
<i>so he had the quartermaster</i>

28:52.700 --> 28:53.999
<i>and the first mate</i>

28:54.001 --> 28:55.133
<i>help him hide the treasure</i>

28:55.135 --> 28:56.935
<i>before they raised anchor.</i>

28:56.937 --> 28:59.137
All right, so the captain
double-crossed his crew

28:59.139 --> 29:00.472
before they could
double-cross him.

29:00.474 --> 29:02.841
Okay, gentlemen. I have
completed my field examination.

29:02.843 --> 29:04.209
What you got?
There were no signs

29:04.211 --> 29:06.345
of foul play.
And based on the damage

29:06.347 --> 29:08.146
to the skull and the positions
of the remains

29:08.148 --> 29:10.215
inside the cave, it appears

29:10.217 --> 29:12.017
that
our intrepid professor

29:12.019 --> 29:13.285
took a bad fall

29:13.287 --> 29:15.754
<i>and sustained</i>
<i>a fatal head injury.</i>

29:17.091 --> 29:19.291
CHIN:
<i>So his death was an accident?</i>

29:19.293 --> 29:21.126
MAX:
I'm afraid so.

29:21.128 --> 29:22.961
I guess we should try
to reach out to the Exley family

29:22.963 --> 29:24.963
if we can,
give 'em some closure,

29:24.965 --> 29:27.165
if nothing else.
GROVER: Well, the techs have mapped

29:27.167 --> 29:29.468
every inch of that cave
and the surrounding area.

29:29.470 --> 29:31.036
There's no sign of buried treasure.
Well, maybe

29:31.038 --> 29:32.268
they moved the treasure
before he got here.

29:32.292 --> 29:33.339
Nope.

29:33.340 --> 29:37.109
CSU said that nothing in the
area has been excavated. Ever.

29:37.111 --> 29:38.844
All right.
Well, then Exley and Jerry

29:38.846 --> 29:40.412
both got the location wrong.

29:40.414 --> 29:42.281
STEVE: Yeah, but according
to Exley's journal,

29:42.283 --> 29:43.949
the treasure's still
on the island.

29:43.951 --> 29:47.119
Which means the killers
are still here.

29:55.629 --> 29:58.630
Yo. Boss man.
Want a slice?

29:58.632 --> 30:00.332
I got pineapple-pepperoni.

30:00.334 --> 30:01.700
A bit Luke, still tasty.

30:01.702 --> 30:03.702
No, I don't. Thank
you. Um, Jerry,

30:03.704 --> 30:05.938
I don't mean to be rude, but do
you have to work in my office,

30:05.940 --> 30:08.941
at my desk... with my stuff?

30:08.943 --> 30:10.142
Not if you gave me an office.

30:10.144 --> 30:11.443
Okay. I'll
consider it.

30:11.445 --> 30:13.145
How about that?
Okay.

30:13.147 --> 30:15.414
But don't take too long.
I do have options.

30:16.250 --> 30:17.716
Noted.

30:17.718 --> 30:18.817
Do you have
something for me

30:18.819 --> 30:20.886
in all this?
Hey, you know the old saying

30:20.888 --> 30:22.988
that the coconut doesn't fall
far from the tree?

30:22.990 --> 30:25.924
I'm pretty sure it's "apple,"
but go on.

30:25.926 --> 30:27.726
Okay, whatever. But that woman
you're looking for,

30:27.728 --> 30:28.760
Cindy Patterson,

30:28.762 --> 30:29.761
it turns out
that not only

30:29.763 --> 30:31.063
is she a modern-day pirate,

30:31.065 --> 30:32.731
she's the descendant of one.

30:32.733 --> 30:35.167
What are you talking about?
Her mother's maiden name

30:35.169 --> 30:36.301
was Washburn.

30:36.303 --> 30:37.502
As in...
As in

30:37.504 --> 30:38.737
Byron Washburn.

30:38.739 --> 30:40.339
She had it legally changed
to Patterson

30:40.341 --> 30:42.608
before Cindy was born.
Chin.

30:42.610 --> 30:43.642
Probably to distance herself

30:43.644 --> 30:45.110
from the legacy
of a murderous pirate.

30:45.112 --> 30:46.411
This is good.
What's up?

30:46.413 --> 30:48.280
All right, check it out.
Cindy Patterson

30:48.282 --> 30:50.148
is Washburn's
great-granddaughter.

30:50.150 --> 30:51.683
Apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

30:51.685 --> 30:53.318
Exactly what I said.

30:55.389 --> 30:59.291
Okay, so Carson buys
Exley's research at auction,

30:59.293 --> 31:01.860
discovers the Washburn
interview, and contacts

31:01.862 --> 31:03.228
the man's family
to offer them a look,

31:03.230 --> 31:04.763
which is what a nice guy
would do.

31:04.765 --> 31:06.465
He makes this call
before he learns

31:06.467 --> 31:07.933
about the buried treasure,

31:07.935 --> 31:10.435
at which point he's already put
himself in danger.

31:11.572 --> 31:13.472
Doesn't this blow your mind?

31:13.474 --> 31:15.240
Your suspect
is a 21st century

31:15.242 --> 31:16.241
Anne Bonny.

31:16.243 --> 31:17.809
How cool is that?

31:18.912 --> 31:20.912
Except for the part
where she kills a guy.

31:20.914 --> 31:22.981
Yeah, except that part.
Oh,

31:22.983 --> 31:24.116
and I did some background

31:24.118 --> 31:25.584
on Cindy Patterson's
great-granddad.

31:25.586 --> 31:28.453
It turns out that he was
on staff here at the palace

31:28.455 --> 31:30.288
for a few years in the '40s,
but he got canned.

31:30.290 --> 31:32.357
What for?
Not sure.

31:32.359 --> 31:33.959
I'm gonna do
some digging

31:33.961 --> 31:36.762
in some old employee records,
see what I can find out. But...

31:36.764 --> 31:38.997
I'm thinking folks discovered
that he had been a pirate.

31:38.999 --> 31:41.466
GROVER: Hey, guys, I
got something.

31:41.468 --> 31:43.669
Come on.
Good work, Jerry.

31:43.671 --> 31:45.637
So, I just got off with TSA.

31:45.639 --> 31:47.639
They told me
that Cindy Patterson flew here

31:47.641 --> 31:49.675
two days ago on a one-way ticket
from Florida.

31:49.677 --> 31:50.809
She was traveling

31:50.811 --> 31:52.611
with this guy.
Notice any resemblance?

31:52.613 --> 31:53.712
Same guy.

31:53.714 --> 31:55.414
Simon Moore's
his name.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.349
What do we know about him?
Not much.

31:57.351 --> 31:59.117
But I checked with his
credit card companies.

31:59.119 --> 32:01.987
As soon as he got into town,
he rented a 40-foot sailboat.

32:01.989 --> 32:02.921
That boat's got to be
how they're planning

32:02.923 --> 32:04.790
to get the treasure
off the island.

32:08.529 --> 32:10.095
GABRIEL:
Wow.

32:10.097 --> 32:12.177
Getting answers out of you two
is like pulling teeth.

32:13.967 --> 32:16.201
I'm sorry.

32:16.203 --> 32:18.503
That was in
poor taste.

32:20.140 --> 32:21.606
This can end.

32:21.608 --> 32:24.810
All you got to do is
give me the passcodes.

32:29.016 --> 32:30.549
No.

32:30.551 --> 32:33.051
No, don't do it!
(muffled shouting)

32:33.053 --> 32:35.587

32:35.589 --> 32:38.490

32:45.065 --> 32:46.732
Something to say?

32:46.734 --> 32:49.234
Okay! Okay, you win.

32:49.236 --> 32:51.103
I'll give you
what you want.

32:51.105 --> 32:52.704
Just don't touch her again.

32:52.706 --> 32:54.039
No, don't do it!

32:54.041 --> 32:56.174
Of course.

32:57.811 --> 33:01.313
No, Adam, no.

33:01.315 --> 33:02.581
Your turn.

33:02.583 --> 33:04.816
Adam, no.
Give Damon the codes.

33:07.187 --> 33:08.620
The codes are useless.

33:08.622 --> 33:11.656
I made specific instructions
with my bank.

33:11.658 --> 33:14.893
The transfer can only
be initiated in person.

Yeah.

recovered the treasure yet.

34:02.876 --> 34:04.836
Or they have and they're
moving it some other way.

Chin, what's that?

34:09.583 --> 34:10.782
Huh.

34:10.784 --> 34:13.217
So much for it
being priceless.

34:16.023 --> 34:17.322
They ripped the frame
off this thing.

34:17.324 --> 34:18.556
There must have been
something inside.

34:18.559 --> 34:20.458
Could've been some clue
on the canvas

34:20.460 --> 34:21.726
or maybe
one of the borders.

All right, this painting

This is wood.

Okay, so the pirates changed it.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.618
But why would they
go through the trouble?

I think the key to finding this
treasure isn't the painting.

Uh-huh.

No, he wasn't.
That's the crazy part.

According to this,
Washburn was born in 1882.

42:26.079 --> 42:28.546

about his age to Exley.

42:28.548 --> 42:30.048
