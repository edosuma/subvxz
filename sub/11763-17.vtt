WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:02.673
OKAY, WE ALL KNOW
WHY WE'RE OVER HERE.

00:02.673 --> 00:04.305
BECAUSE WE'RE
ALWAYS HERE?

00:04.305 --> 00:06.307
PARTLY, BUT TODAY
BOBBY'S HEADING OFF

00:06.307 --> 00:09.240
TO DO HIS FIRST
PRO GOLF TOURNAMENT IN YEARS.

00:09.240 --> 00:11.282
TO BOBBY!
(all cheer)

00:11.282 --> 00:12.783
TO ME!
(clinking)

00:12.783 --> 00:15.786
JULES, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YOU SPONSOR AN AFRICAN CHILD.

00:15.786 --> 00:18.419
OH, YEAH. LITTLE OMARI.
HE'S 10.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.422
I GOT TO SAY, THOSE LETTERS ARE
GETTING A LITTLE REPETITIVE--

00:21.422 --> 00:24.024
"IT'S HOT, I'M HUNGRY,
THERE'S SNAKES," YOU KNOW.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.496
SURE, SURE.

00:27.398 --> 00:30.531
BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE DID
ACTUAL VOLUNTEER WORK, YOU KNOW?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.533
I RAISE MONEY
FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.266
I HELP ERADICATE NON-INDIGENOUS
SPECIES IN THE EVERGLADES.

00:35.266 --> 00:37.268
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:37.268 --> 00:40.341
I VOLUNTEER
AT A SOUP KITCHEN.
BEING A TASTER DOESN'T COUNT.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.613
I VOLUNTEER
AT A WOMEN'S SHELTER.

00:42.613 --> 00:45.616
SO EVERYBODY DOES CHARITY WORK
EXCEPT FOR ANDY AND ME?

00:45.616 --> 00:48.479
I VOLUNTEER AT THE SHELTER, TOO.
DURING SELF-DEFENSE CLASSES,

00:48.479 --> 00:52.253
THE WOMEN TAKE TURNS
KICKING ME IN THE CROTCH.
SO IT'S LIKE A DAY
AT HOME FOR YOU.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.155
(laughing)

00:54.155 --> 00:57.558
LAUGH!
I AM TOTALLY TWEETING THAT.

00:57.558 --> 01:01.061
"ANOTHER DAY,
ANOTHER KICK IN THE CROTCH."

01:01.061 --> 01:05.236
THE LARMY IS GONNA LOVE THIS
ONE. THAT'S MY TWITTER NAME.

01:05.236 --> 01:09.140
"TheLarmy" STANDS FOR
"THE LAURIE'S ARMY."

01:09.140 --> 01:13.844
GOOD GOD.
AN ARMY OF JELLY BEANS.

01:13.844 --> 01:16.507
BOBBY, I WISH
YOU'D LET ME GO WITH YOU.
SORRY, J-BIRD.
IF YOU'RE THERE,

01:16.507 --> 01:18.679
I'LL BE AS NERVOUS
AS A RABBIT AT A RACETRACK.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.412
WHAT DID HE SAY?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

01:21.412 --> 01:24.815
YOU CAN COME SATURDAY
IF I MAKE THE CUT.
WHENYOU MAKE THE CUT.

01:24.815 --> 01:27.818
OKAY, EVERYBODY, LET'S HOLD
HANDS. COME ON. GET...
NO!

01:27.818 --> 01:30.691
COME ON. LET'S DO IT.
BOBBY, GIVE ME YOUR LUCKY VISOR.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.564
NOW, EVERYONE,
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

01:33.564 --> 01:36.867
FEEL YOUR BODY'S
POSITIVE ENERGY, ALL OF IT.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.869
FEEL IT FLOWING THROUGH THE HAT.

01:38.869 --> 01:41.702
THIS IS WHAT I DO
WITH MY LIFE NOW.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.575
I'M INSTRUCTING THE LARMY
TO TWEET POSITIVE VIBES.

01:44.575 --> 01:46.477
THEY'RE CALLED TWIBES.

01:46.477 --> 01:49.340
BOBBY DOESN'T NEED VIBES.
I'M HIS CADDY.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.442
GOT IT COVERED.

01:51.442 --> 01:54.445
HIS PUTTER'S
ON TOP OF THE CAR.
I KNOW THAT.

01:54.445 --> 01:57.218
AND AWAY WE GO.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.619
(engine revs)

01:58.619 --> 02:03.454
POSITIVE VIBES ON THE CAR,
EVERYONE! POSITIVE VIBES!

02:03.454 --> 02:05.196
(exhales)

02:05.196 --> 02:08.199
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT YOUR BAR
COULDN'T GET ANY LESS COOL...

02:08.199 --> 02:10.130
BAR TRIVIA!

02:10.130 --> 02:12.663
WELCOME TO T.G.I. GRAYSON'S,
EVERYONE.

02:12.663 --> 02:15.566
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

02:15.566 --> 02:17.168
UGH.
THESE GAMES ARE DESIGNED

02:17.168 --> 02:20.171
TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL
IN FRONT OF TOTAL STRANGERS.

02:20.171 --> 02:22.142
(chime)
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,
IT'S MY BIGGEST FEAR.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.545
WHEN IT HAPPENS,
I GO INTO TOTAL-BODY SHUTDOWN.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.318
I-I CAN'T SPEAK.
I LOOK LIKE A SUPER-SEXY CORPSE.

02:27.318 --> 02:28.779
WAY TO SELF-COMPLIMENT.

02:28.779 --> 02:31.222
I THOUGHT I SNUCK IT IN THERE.

02:31.222 --> 02:33.884
OKAY. LET'S PLAY. JELLY BEAN'S
OUT, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

02:33.884 --> 02:35.426
WHAT? WHY ME?

02:35.426 --> 02:37.428
JULES IS ALSO OUT...
BIGGEST FEAR.

02:37.428 --> 02:40.431
BIGGEST FEAR. SO THAT LEAVES ME,
COLLEGE, AND THE BARTENDER

02:40.431 --> 02:44.595
WHO PRETENDS HE'S SMART BUT WHO
METHINKS IS SECRETLY A JELLY.

02:44.595 --> 02:46.567
OH, IT'S ON, ICE WOMAN.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.569
WHAT'S BOBBY'S
LUCKY VISOR DOING HERE?

02:48.569 --> 02:51.572
OH, NO. HE AND ANDY
STOPPED BY HERE FOR LUNCH.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.174
THEY MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN IT.
OH, GREAT.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.177
ARE WE SURE ANDY'S THE RIGHT
PERSON TO TAKE CARE OF HIM?

02:57.177 --> 03:00.251
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYTHING'S PUT AWAY.

03:00.251 --> 03:03.254
YOU THINK I CAN FIT
IN THIS DUFFEL BAG?

03:03.254 --> 03:04.885
I DO NOT.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.487
OKAY, WE'RE AGREED.

03:06.487 --> 03:09.220
WHOEVER LOSES TRIVIA HAS TO
DRIVE BOBBY'S VISOR TO HIM.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.622
WHAT?! YOU'RE NOT EVEN PLAYING!
I KNOW.

03:11.622 --> 03:14.225
HE'S JUST PISSY
'CAUSE HE'S IN LAST PLACE.
(buzzer)

03:14.225 --> 03:16.567
YOU OKAY THERE, BUDDY?
YOU SEEM A LITTLEDUMB.

03:16.567 --> 03:18.969
YEAH, WHAT, DOES YOUR COLLEGE
JUST LET ANYONE IN?

03:18.969 --> 03:22.333
NO, YOU HAVE TO BE
REALLY GOOD AT ART... SO YEAH.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.336
I AM SO GLAD I'M NOT PLAYING
THAT GAME. I MEAN, LOOK.

03:25.336 --> 03:27.338
SOME DOCTOR
NAMED BENJAMIN RUSH

03:27.338 --> 03:29.340
SIGNED THE DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE?

03:29.340 --> 03:30.681
HMM.

03:30.681 --> 03:33.984
THE ONLY TWO NAMES I KNOW ARE
JOHN HANCOCK AND RICHARD STANDS.

03:33.984 --> 03:37.748
JOHN HANCOCK IS A REAL PERSON?
I THOUGHT IT WAS A SEX ACT.

03:37.748 --> 03:40.351
OKAY, SO NOW THAT
I FEEL SO GUILTY,

03:40.351 --> 03:43.494
WHAT CHARITY DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD JUMP INTO?

03:43.494 --> 03:46.226
DO MINE! IT'S CALLED
THE WONDER OF READING, AND WE

03:46.226 --> 03:48.629
HELP RAISE FUNDING TO KEEP
LIBRARIES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.231
I WENT TO A CRAP SCHOOL
IN A CRAP NEIGHBORHOOD,

03:51.231 --> 03:53.764
AND READING REALLY GOT ME OUT.
AW, REALLY?

03:53.764 --> 03:55.766
(laughs)
NO, CAR MODELING DID,

03:55.766 --> 03:58.839
BUT IT'S REALLY FUN
TO SAY READING DID.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.240
(buzzer)
DAMN IT!

04:00.240 --> 04:03.514
HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW WHO BOB GRIESE IS?

04:03.514 --> 04:05.916
SORRY, SPORT. GOOD NEWS--WE'LL
NEVER CALL YOU "SPORT" AGAIN,

04:05.916 --> 04:08.319
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY,
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SPORTS.

04:08.319 --> 04:11.322
(chuckles) BAD NEWS IS,
YOU HAVE TO DRIVE TWO HOURS

04:11.322 --> 04:14.254
TO DELIVER A MAGICAL VISOR
FULL OF DREAMS AND RAINBOWS.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.356
(chuckles)

04:15.356 --> 04:17.988
WHICH ARE REAL AND IMPORTANT.

04:17.988 --> 04:20.291
I WILL NOT BE MOCKED.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.533
(imitates Travis)
"I WILL NOT BE MOCKED."

04:22.533 --> 04:23.864
MOM, THEY'RE MOCKING ME.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.836
(imitates Travis)
MOCKING IS BAD.

04:25.836 --> 04:28.369
I KNOW, SWEETIE.

04:28.369 --> 04:32.343
SO YOU DRIVE UP THERE AND YOU
MAKE SURE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY.

04:32.343 --> 04:34.545
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?

04:34.545 --> 04:36.547
GET ME OUTTA HERE, MAN!

04:36.547 --> 04:39.810
MY GOLFING SHOULDER'S
STARTING TO CRAMP UP!
THE ZIPPER'S STUCK!

04:39.810 --> 04:42.713
OH, MY GOD.

04:42.713 --> 04:45.716
FROM NOW ON, I'M IN CHARGE.
DAD, WE HAVE TO SIGN IN

04:45.716 --> 04:48.319
AT THE CLUBHOUSE AT 8:00 A.M.
I SET YOUR ALARM,

04:48.319 --> 04:50.721
LAID OUT SOME CLOTHES,
AND BOUGHT YOU SOME SOCKS.

04:50.721 --> 04:53.724
ANDY, YOU'RE GONNA BE CARRYING
A HEAVY BAG IN THE HOT SUN

04:53.724 --> 04:56.767
FOR HOURS.
ARE YOU READY FOR THAT?
I'VE BEEN TRAINING
IN THE POOL FOR WEEKS.

05:01.772 --> 05:03.774
(indistinct conversations)
I WASN'T POINTING FINGERS,
CAROL.

05:03.774 --> 05:06.306
I JUST THINK
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD

05:06.306 --> 05:08.709
ENOUGH COFFEE AND DANISH
FOR THE TEACHERS AS WELL.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.711
YOU ARE GONNA BE
THE BEST THING

05:10.711 --> 05:12.713
THAT EVER HAPPENED
TO THIS CHARITY,

05:12.713 --> 05:15.045
BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW QUICKLY YOU TOOK OVER.

05:15.045 --> 05:18.519
WATCH THIS. SHH, SHH.
(conversations stop)

05:18.519 --> 05:20.991
I OWN THE SHUSH CLAP.
(chuckles)

05:20.991 --> 05:23.594
WE ARE SO EXCITED
ABOUT OUR NEW LIBRARY.

05:23.594 --> 05:25.996
CAN WE GIVE
A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE

05:25.996 --> 05:29.730
TO THE WOMEN WHO HELPED
MAKE IT HAPPEN?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.934
WOULD YOU LADIES
LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.636
I DIDN'T PREPARE ANYTHING.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.037
READING...

05:37.037 --> 05:39.009
IS EVERYTHING.

05:39.009 --> 05:41.912
I GREW UP IN THE HOOD, Y'ALL.

05:41.912 --> 05:44.915
MY BEST FRIEND JO JO
GOT SHOT IN THE FACE.

05:44.915 --> 05:47.518
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME,

05:47.518 --> 05:50.581
BUT... READING GOT ME OUT.

05:50.581 --> 05:52.022
I THINK IT WOULD
BE APPROPRIATE

05:52.022 --> 05:54.855
IF MRS. COBB LED
THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.527
ALL RISE.

05:56.527 --> 05:58.128
WOW. COOL.

05:58.128 --> 05:59.790
OKAY.

05:59.790 --> 06:02.533
(children reciting along)
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE
TO THE FLAG

06:02.533 --> 06:04.635
OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA

06:04.635 --> 06:09.670
AND TO THE REPUBLIC
FOR RICHARD STANDS...

06:09.670 --> 06:10.971
WHAT?

06:10.971 --> 06:13.944
IT'S "FORWHICHIT STANDS."

06:13.944 --> 06:15.846
OH.
OH, NO.

06:15.846 --> 06:19.610
FULL-BODY SHUTDOWN. BREATHE.
JULES, HONEY, JUST BREATHE.

06:19.610 --> 06:22.152
(strained voice) HELP ME.

06:22.152 --> 06:27.157
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:33.664 --> 06:37.828
I THOUGHT RICHARD STANDS
WROTE THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.

06:37.828 --> 06:40.971
THAT'S WHY HE GOT TO SIGN
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.

06:40.971 --> 06:42.703
OF COURSE.
SURE.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.104
"RICHARD STANDS"SOUNDSREAL,

06:44.104 --> 06:47.107
LIKE ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT YOU
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HE DID,

06:47.107 --> 06:49.079
BUT THERE'S A BEER
NAMED AFTER HIM.

06:49.079 --> 06:52.082
YOU KNOW WHO SHOULD HAVE
A BEER NAMED AFTER THEM?

06:52.082 --> 06:53.684
BEN FRANKLIN.

06:53.684 --> 06:56.817
YEAH, HE INVENTED BASEBALL,
HE WAS AN AWESOME PRESIDENT,

06:56.817 --> 06:59.690
AND HE MADE THE FIRST WIG.

06:59.690 --> 07:02.753
ZERO OF THOSE THINGS
ARE CORRECT.
OKAY.

07:02.753 --> 07:05.155
THOSE KIDS ARE GONNA TELL
THEIR PARENTS WHAT HAPPENED,

07:05.155 --> 07:07.458
THEIR PARENTS ARE GONNA
TELLTHEIRFRIENDS...

07:07.458 --> 07:09.860
THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T
DO CHARITY WORK.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.863
I'M GONNA GO UP AND GET
IN MY BED FOR ABOUT A WEEK.

07:12.863 --> 07:14.465
JUST TELL EVERYONE I HAVE MONO.

07:14.465 --> 07:17.137
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. YOU
SHOULDN'T FEEL STUPID. YOU KNOW,

07:17.137 --> 07:20.671
MOST AMERICANS DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS.

07:20.671 --> 07:22.613
(whispers)
PLEASE DON'T ASK ME.

07:22.613 --> 07:24.014
WELL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

07:24.014 --> 07:26.647
HOW MANY SUPREME COURT JUSTICES
THERE ARE. WE'RE ALL DUMB.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.950
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.
THERE ARE NINE.
NINE.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.023
MM-HMM, AND HOW MANY MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS ARE THERE?

07:33.023 --> 07:35.025
WELL, THAT'S A TRICK QUESTION,
'CAUSE...

07:35.025 --> 07:37.027
YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS ON, UH...

07:37.027 --> 07:41.492
YOU KNOW, WHAT THE LOBBYISTS
ARE DOING IN THE DISTRICTS...

07:41.492 --> 07:43.794
FINE. WE'RE ALL DUMB.
REALLY?

07:43.794 --> 07:45.536
(laughs) I'M SO DUMB.

07:45.536 --> 07:46.567
YES.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.168
AW. THANK YOU.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.071
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD,

07:51.071 --> 07:54.805
WHAT HAPPENED AT THAT SCHOOL
WILL NOT BOTHER ME.

07:54.805 --> 07:56.046
ATTABOY, RICHARD.

07:56.046 --> 07:57.708
(groans)

07:57.708 --> 08:00.150
THAT WILL NEVER
BE SPOKEN OF AGAIN,

08:00.150 --> 08:03.754
WHICH IS WHY IT WILL NOT
BOTHER ME. GOOD-BYE.

08:03.754 --> 08:07.157
SO... I HEAR THAT
SHE KICKED YOUR ASS.

08:07.157 --> 08:10.260
MUST STING TO LOSE
TO OLDIE LOCKS.

08:10.260 --> 08:11.862
I LET HER WIN.

08:11.862 --> 08:13.724
REALLY? LET'S GO AGAIN.

08:13.724 --> 08:15.566
OOH. CAN I PLAY, TOO?

08:15.566 --> 08:20.170
THAT WOULD BE LIKE TAKING CANDY
FROM A BABY. NO. AN ANIMAL BABY.

08:20.170 --> 08:24.134
(chuckles) YOU'RE SO MEAN.
I SWEAR, I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

08:24.134 --> 08:25.736
IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
UH-HUH.

08:25.736 --> 08:29.109
DON'T TAKE ME LIGHTLY. I'M
ACTUALLY BETTER THAN YOU THINK.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.583
YOU'D HAVE TO BE.
(chuckles)

08:34.615 --> 08:38.148
OOH! HOT MUSTARD,
THESE HOLES ARE SMALLER HERE.

08:38.148 --> 08:40.751
LOOK, YOU JUST NEED
TO CALM DOWN, OKAY?

08:40.751 --> 08:43.554
MAYBE STOP RANDOMLY
HOLDING YOUR BREATH SO MUCH?
(exhales)

08:43.554 --> 08:46.557
ANDY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU HAVING A LITTLE STROKE?
I GOT SOME WATER

08:46.557 --> 08:50.561
IN MY EAR THIS MORNING, DOING
MY DRILLS IN THE HOTEL POOL.
YOU WENT IN THAT POOL?

08:50.561 --> 08:53.003
IT'S GROSS.
THERE'S A DEAD SEAGULL IN IT.

08:53.003 --> 08:56.567
I BETTER RUN AND GET SOME
RUBBING ALCOHOL TO DRY IT OUT.

08:56.567 --> 08:57.968
NO. THERE'S NO TIME.

08:57.968 --> 08:59.610
MAN, I'M NERVOUS.

08:59.610 --> 09:01.742
ANDY, CONFIDENCE DANCE.

09:03.774 --> 09:05.876
ANDY...

09:05.876 --> 09:08.749
MAN DOWN, TRAV.
SUB IN, BABY.

09:13.984 --> 09:16.627
(horns honking)

09:16.627 --> 09:18.188
(beeps)

09:18.188 --> 09:20.931
(cell phone rings)

09:20.931 --> 09:22.933
THIS GUY KEEPS LOOKING AT ME

09:22.933 --> 09:24.895
LIKE HE KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE SCHOOL.

09:24.895 --> 09:27.898
I BET HE'S THE DAD
OF THAT LITTLE BLONDE GIRL.

09:27.898 --> 09:30.070
THEY BOTH HAVE
THE SAME STUPID PONY TAIL.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.572
YOU'RE IMAGINING IT.
STAY STRONG.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.974
Thank you.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.575
I'M MUCH BETTER NOW. OKAY.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.810
ALL RIGHT. TIME-OUT ON THE GAME.
IT'S YOUR TURN. THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:39.810 --> 09:42.152
(cell phone rings)
HEY, JULES.

09:42.152 --> 09:46.186
HEY.
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S
WHY HE'S STARING AT YOU.

09:46.186 --> 09:50.861
YOU KNOW, HONEY, HE PROBABLY
JUST THINKS YOU'RE REALLY HOT.

09:50.861 --> 09:52.863
MY CALVES DO
LOOK PRETTY GREAT.

09:52.863 --> 09:56.727
YOU KNOW, THE TRICK IS TO STORE
YOUR COOKIES ON THE TOP SHELF,

09:56.727 --> 09:59.630
AND THEN YOU JUST
GO FOR THEM ONE... AT A TIME.

09:59.630 --> 10:01.071
OKAY, SWEETIE.

10:01.071 --> 10:02.903
(beep)
GAME ON.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.080
(chime)
YES! HA! THE ANSWER IS
GRANDMA MOSES.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.082
YOU SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT,
ELLIE.

10:12.082 --> 10:15.115
WEREN'T THE TWO OF YOU,
LIKE, SORORITY SISTERS?

10:15.115 --> 10:18.018
ALL RIGHT. GAME OFF.
BOBBY'S ABOUT TO PLAY.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.790
NO, WE'RE PLAYING!

10:19.790 --> 10:22.392
I SAID GAME OFF.
(applause)

10:22.392 --> 10:24.955
(man) NEXT UP IS BOBBY COBB.
A GREAT STORY--

10:24.955 --> 10:26.356
A LOCAL CLUB PRO,

10:26.356 --> 10:29.259
AND AT 40, HIS CAREER IS
GETTING A SECOND ACT.

10:29.259 --> 10:31.631
ALL RIGHT, BUD. NOW OR NEVER.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.033
MOMENT OF TRUTH, BOBBY!

10:33.033 --> 10:36.737
(loudly) AM I TALKING LOUD?

10:36.737 --> 10:38.138
LET'S HOLD HANDS.
OKAY.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.409
BOBBY NEEDS POSITIVE VIBES.

10:39.409 --> 10:41.712
VIBES CAN'T BE SENT
THROUGH A TV.

10:41.712 --> 10:44.715
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT VIBES?
OR POSITIVITY, FOR THAT MATTER?

10:44.715 --> 10:46.316
COME ON. HOLD MY HAND.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.379
(whack)

10:49.379 --> 10:51.752
BEAUTIFUL SHOT!
(squeals)

10:51.752 --> 10:53.283
WHOO!

10:53.283 --> 10:55.125
PSYCHICALLY STRONG!

10:55.125 --> 10:58.989
DO YOU TAKE REQUESTS? 'CAUSE I'D
LIKE TO TALK TO MY DEAD PARENTS.

10:58.989 --> 11:01.031
ALL RIGHT,
FINISH THE GAME.

11:01.031 --> 11:03.433
UH-OH. LAST QUESTION,
AND THIS ONE'S GONNA DECIDE IT.

11:03.433 --> 11:07.768
HUH. WHEREISMAURITANIA?

11:07.768 --> 11:10.170
(clatter)

11:10.170 --> 11:14.745
AW, LOOKS LIKE
PRETTY BOY IS OUT.
I KNOW THIS, I KNOW THIS...

11:14.745 --> 11:17.848
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU DO.
AFRICA...
(chime)

11:17.848 --> 11:19.179
BOOM! I WIN!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.250
NO!

11:20.250 --> 11:22.252
"DEAR theLarmy--

11:22.252 --> 11:26.717
OPERATION 'SUCK IT'
IS COMPLETE."

11:26.717 --> 11:28.188
OKAY, PUT BOBBY BACK ON.

11:28.188 --> 11:32.192
WELL, WELL. IF IT ISN'T
GULF HAVEN'S RESIDENT HISTORIAN.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.895
EXCUSE ME?
I WAS TALKING WITH
MY LIFE COACH KENNY--

11:34.895 --> 11:39.329
YES, I HAVE A LIFE COACH,
WHICH IS WHY I'MKICKING ASS!

11:39.329 --> 11:40.931
HIS DAUGHTER TOLD HIM

11:40.931 --> 11:43.273
ABOUT YOUR RECENT PLEDGE GAFFE
AT HER SCHOOL.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.337
IKNEWIT.

11:47.337 --> 11:51.311
(laughs) RICHARD STANDS.
(laughs) YEESH.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.913
OH, BUT THANK YOU.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.245
EVERYBODY'S GONNA KNOW.

11:55.245 --> 11:57.247
HEY, BOBBY'S BACK ON.

11:57.247 --> 12:00.991
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S 260 YARDS TO THE GREEN.

12:00.991 --> 12:04.825
MY BRAIN SAYS PLAY IT SAFE,
BUT MY MAN PARTS SAY GO FOR IT.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.827
ANDY, HAND ME THE HAMMER.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.259
I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.
ACT OUT WHAT YOU SAID.

12:09.259 --> 12:12.102
(exhales)

12:12.102 --> 12:14.304
OH, HAMMER! OKAY.

12:16.506 --> 12:18.238
DEAR LORD,

12:18.238 --> 12:21.211
YOU KNOW I DON'T BOTHER YOU
UNLESS IT'S IMPORTANT.

12:21.211 --> 12:24.875
EXCEPT FOR THE TIME THAT I
ASKED YOU TO SPEED UP MY BANGS.

12:24.875 --> 12:28.378
I'M SORRY. IT WAS JUST--
SEEMED SO SERIOUS.

12:28.378 --> 12:30.380
BUT THIS IS A TRUE EMERGENCY.

12:30.380 --> 12:33.824
PLEASE, PLEASE,
TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT OFF OF ME

12:33.824 --> 12:37.387
AND PUT IT ONTO SOMEONE ELSE.
AMEN.

12:39.329 --> 12:41.191
(whack)

12:43.964 --> 12:45.335
(applause)

12:45.335 --> 12:48.338
OHH! WHOO-HOO!

12:48.338 --> 12:52.002
THAT'S A GREAT--OH, NO.
BOBBY COBB HAS JUST

12:52.002 --> 12:55.105
HIT HIS COMPETITOR'S BALL
ONTO THE GREEN.
WHAT?

12:55.105 --> 12:57.207
(man) I DON'T THINK
HE EVEN KNOWS

12:57.207 --> 12:59.349
THAT HE'S MADE
A HUGE, HUGE ERROR.

12:59.349 --> 13:02.012
BOBBY CELEBRATES, RIDING
HIS CLUB LIKE IT'S A HORSE.
(hooting)

13:02.012 --> 13:05.155
THAT'S A 2-STROKE PENALTY FOR
HITTING ANOTHER PLAYER'S BALL.

13:05.155 --> 13:07.787
WHY DIDN'T HIS CADDY
STOP HIM?
I DON'T KNOW.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.120
UH, HE APPEARS TO BE DRUNK.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.392
WHAT A DEVASTATING START
FOR THIS LOCAL CLUB PRO.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.795
I HOPE OUR GUY IS STRONG
ENOUGHTO BOUNCE BACK

13:15.795 --> 13:18.028
AND NOT LET IT SINK HIM.
UH, HE'S NOT.

13:18.028 --> 13:21.331
NOWYOU LISTEN?

13:27.838 --> 13:30.240
NOT A GREAT DAY
FOR LOCAL GOLF PRO BOBBY COBB,

13:30.240 --> 13:33.243
WHO, AFTER HITTING ANOTHER
PLAYER'S BALL IN A TOURNAMENT,

13:33.243 --> 13:34.814
HAD A FULL-ON MELTDOWN,

13:34.814 --> 13:37.547
NOT TO MENTION HIS CADDY
STUMBLING INTO A SAND TRAP.

13:37.547 --> 13:40.020
WELL, AT LEAST
THEY DIDN'T USE THE NAME.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.953
HATS OFF TO YOU,
BOBBY "WRONG BALLS" COBB.

13:42.953 --> 13:44.424
YOU'RE A LEGEND.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.426
(exhales deeply)

13:46.426 --> 13:50.260
YOU WERE ON TV. THAT'S NEAT!
(slaps leg)

13:50.260 --> 13:52.102
YEAH, I'M GOING HOME.

13:52.102 --> 13:54.434
OH, COME ON, MAN.
NOBODY WATCHES SPORTS.

13:54.434 --> 13:59.539
"WRONG BALLS" IS TRENDING ON
TWITTER. IT'S ABOVE "BIEBER."

13:59.539 --> 14:01.611
HELPFUL.
WHAT?

14:01.611 --> 14:04.514
YOU ALL SOUND LIKE THAT TEACHER
ON THE "PEANUTS" CARTOON.
(door opens and closes)

14:04.514 --> 14:08.418
GET OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT!
OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT! OUT!

14:08.418 --> 14:10.420
THIS IS MY FAULT.

14:10.420 --> 14:13.023
TRAVIS, BLAMING YOURSELF
FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S ACTIONS

14:13.023 --> 14:15.425
IS RIDICULOUS.
BESIDES, I MADE THIS HAPPEN

14:15.425 --> 14:18.158
BY WISHING IT SO.
I REALLY ABUSED MY POWERS.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.130
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY POWERS.

14:20.130 --> 14:23.263
MY PSYCHIC SAID
YOU'D SAY THAT.
PSYCHICS ARE STUPID.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.896
SHE SAID YOU'D SAY THAT.
WELL, I CAN'T WIN
AT THIS GAME.

14:25.896 --> 14:29.199
CALM DOWN. THIS IS MY SCREWUP.
LET ME GO APOLOGIZE TO DAD.

14:29.199 --> 14:32.102
NO. THIS ISMYBAD.
IGET TO APOLOGIZE TO HIM.

14:32.102 --> 14:34.404
COOL! WIZARD VERSUS NERD!

14:34.404 --> 14:37.908
(dramatic voice) "I'LL STRIKE
YOU DOWN WITH MY SPELL!"

14:37.908 --> 14:42.112
(nerdy voice)
"NO, SCIENCE IS THE ANSWER!"

14:42.112 --> 14:43.513
(chuckles)

14:43.513 --> 14:48.018
AH, AHA! I THINK I GOT IT OUT.
SOMEBODY SAY SOMETHING TO ME.

14:48.018 --> 14:51.221
(door opens and closes)
WAH, WAH-WAH, WAH, WAH-WAH.

14:54.664 --> 14:57.367
IT CHEWS GUM WHILE
IT EATS BUFFALO WINGS.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.369
HOW DID IT BEAT US?

14:59.369 --> 15:01.231
(pop)
LOOK...

15:01.231 --> 15:03.233
I USED TO WATCH
"JEOPARDY!" EVERY DAY

15:03.233 --> 15:05.635
BECAUSE I HAD A MAJOR LADY ROD
FOR ALEX TREBEK...

15:05.635 --> 15:09.239
TILL I FOUND OUT
HE WAS CANADIAN. GROSS.

15:09.239 --> 15:11.281
THIS CAN'T END LIKE THIS.

15:11.281 --> 15:14.244
TEAM UP IF YOU WANT. I'LL TAKE
YOU BOTH DOWN TOGETHER.

15:14.244 --> 15:17.147
WANT TO FORM AN ALLIANCE?
TEAM UP LIKE NATO?

15:17.147 --> 15:20.690
ISN'T NATO THE GUY THAT LIVED
IN O.J.'s GUEST HOUSE?
HOW?

15:22.552 --> 15:26.997
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU
CAN'T SEE THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

15:26.997 --> 15:28.999
UM, BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT MAGIC?

15:28.999 --> 15:30.400
AAH! (grunts)

15:30.400 --> 15:33.403
OH, HONEY, I JUST WISH THAT
WATER WOULD COME OUT ALREADY.

15:33.403 --> 15:37.707
AH--AH-HA-HA!
OH-HO-HO! OHH! OHH!

15:37.707 --> 15:39.569
I BELIEVE.

15:39.569 --> 15:41.711
LOOK.

15:41.711 --> 15:44.214
HOW MANY OF THESE HAVE YOU SOLD?
TEN.

15:44.214 --> 15:46.676
OKAY, I'M GONNA
BUY THE REST. HERE.

15:46.676 --> 15:50.280
OKAY. EVERYBODY,
WE GOT TO FIND THE OTHER TEN.
LET'S SPLIT UP.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.382
OKAY. NO, NO.
NO, MOVE IT!

15:52.382 --> 15:55.385
в™Єв™Єв™Є

16:11.571 --> 16:13.143
I NEED THAT SHIRT.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.310
GIVE ME THE SHIRT.

16:22.552 --> 16:25.015
YOU'RE A WEIRDO.

16:25.015 --> 16:27.987
THIS WILL NEVER BE
SPOKEN OF AGAIN.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.290
COME ON.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.162
(buzzer)
WHAT? (sputters)

16:32.162 --> 16:33.563
"'SUP, theLarmy?

16:33.563 --> 16:38.098
I'M SUPER BUSY
WHIPPING SOME CHUMP-HOUSES."

16:38.098 --> 16:39.769
HEY, BARTENDER,

16:39.769 --> 16:42.672
HOW COULD YOU MISS
A QUESTION ABOUT BARTENDING?
I DON'TKNOW,OKAY?

16:42.672 --> 16:45.575
YOU MISSED THE ONE ABOUT
BLOOD-DRAINING PARASITES.

16:45.575 --> 16:48.778
NOT THE SAME.
IT IS... (high-pitched voice)
THE SAME.

16:48.778 --> 16:50.510
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S UP?
(clears throat)

16:50.510 --> 16:53.513
MOM SAID I COULD APOLOGIZE
FIRST, AND THEN SHE'S GOING TO,

16:53.513 --> 16:56.186
AND I QUOTE, "BRING IT HOME
WITH SOME REAL EMOTION."

16:56.186 --> 16:59.189
(clicks teeth)
LOOK, YOU ALWAYS HAVE MY BACK,
AND I FEEL AWFUL THAT--

16:59.189 --> 17:01.651
SHE'S INHALING TO CUT ME OFF
AND START TALKING,

17:01.651 --> 17:04.554
SO I JUST WANT TO
CLOSE WITH I LOVE YOU!
IT WAS MY FAULT.

17:04.554 --> 17:07.557
I WAS SO EMBARRASSED BY
THAT SCHOOL THING, THAT I WISHED

17:07.557 --> 17:10.700
THAT SOMETHING BAD WOULD HAPPEN
TO TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT OFF OF ME.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.233
I WISHED THAT YOU WOULD MESS UP.
OKAY, TRAV, GO AHEAD.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.236
DIVE IN. LET HIM KNOW
WHAT YOU DID WAS WORSE.
NOPE. YOU WIN.
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.438
SO YOU "NOONANED" ME?
WHAT?

17:18.438 --> 17:20.640
"CADDYSHACK" REFERENCE,
MEANS YOU WANTED HIM TO MESS UP.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.243
OH. YES,
THEN I "NOONANED" YOU.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.376
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO TAKE THIS ALL BACK.

17:26.376 --> 17:28.778
I EVEN WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT ALL THESE SHIRTS.

17:28.778 --> 17:34.654
WHAT KIND OF JERK WOULD WANT
TO PROFIT FROM YOUR PAIN?
WHAT UP! (laughs)

17:34.654 --> 17:37.587
(whistles)
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17:37.587 --> 17:39.459
(chime)
YES! (chuckles)

17:39.459 --> 17:41.591
(beeps)

17:41.591 --> 17:44.594
NO FAIR! "MUSIC FROM THE '80s"?
YOU GUYS, I'M TOO YOUNG.

17:44.594 --> 17:47.197
ALL I KNOW ABOUT MUSIC
FROM THE '80s IS...

17:47.197 --> 17:48.738
EVERYTHING!

17:48.738 --> 17:51.741
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS. I SLEPT
WITH A FEW BANDS IN THE '80s.

17:51.741 --> 17:54.744
YEAH, WELL I HOPE YOU BANGED
YOUR WAY FROM a-ha TO ZZ TOP,

17:54.744 --> 17:57.307
BECAUSE WE NEED THIS.

17:57.307 --> 18:00.410
YOU ALWAYS DID HATE
TO BE EMBARRASSED, J-BIRD.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.282
I'M WEIRD THAT WAY.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.315
WHEN SOMEBODY HUMILIATES ME,
I GO STRAIGHT-UP REVENGE.

18:05.315 --> 18:07.457
(cell phone alert chimes)
OH. OH, HEY, DAD,

18:07.457 --> 18:10.120
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT
38 SPECIAL SONG YOU LIKE?

18:10.120 --> 18:11.561
"HOLD ON LOOSELY."

18:11.561 --> 18:14.864
THANK YOU.

18:14.864 --> 18:17.096
"HOLD ON LOOSELY."
(chime)

18:17.096 --> 18:20.530
OH! GAME, SET, MIZ-ATCH!

18:20.530 --> 18:23.533
AW. BAR'S CLOSED!
EVERYBODY OUT, BAR'S CLOSED.

18:23.533 --> 18:26.406
WOW, BIG BRAIN
ANDROCKIN' HOOTS AND STEMS?

18:26.406 --> 18:28.408
JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU,

18:28.408 --> 18:31.511
CAN NEVER JUDGE A BOOK
BY ITS FRONT PART.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.644
I'M SERIOUS! I'M SERIOUS!
EVERYONE OUT!

18:34.644 --> 18:36.146
(all laugh)

18:36.146 --> 18:39.149
I'VE BEEN HELPING HER
DESTROY 'EM ALL DAY.

18:39.149 --> 18:42.652
YOU ARE AN EVIL GENIUS.
(slaps leg)

18:42.652 --> 18:44.894
I'M JUST EVIL.
OKAY. FIRST OFF,

18:44.894 --> 18:47.597
YOU KNOW THESE T-SHIRTS
ARE NON-REFUNDABLE, RIGHT?

18:47.597 --> 18:50.200
YEAH, I SAW THE SIGN
ON THE TABLE.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.402
SECONDLY, YOU DIDN'TMAKE
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO ME.

18:52.402 --> 18:55.134
I KNOW.
I MEAN, I AM VERY POWERFUL.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.336
SO POWERFUL.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.738
YEP. YOU CONTROL THINGS
WITH YOUR MIND.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.240
(mouths word)

19:00.240 --> 19:02.642
I WANTED YOU TO DO SO WELL
IN THAT TOURNAMENT.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.245
BUT THEN I GOT A LITTLE BIT
EMBARRASSED, AND THEN

19:05.245 --> 19:09.249
THAT JUST WENT OUT THE WINDOW.
I'M JUST--I'M SO SORRY, BOBBY.

19:09.249 --> 19:13.223
I GOT A ONE-WORD RESPONSE
TO THAT. (blows raspberry)

19:13.223 --> 19:16.556
HA! COME ON.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHIN'.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.258
WRONG BALLS!

19:18.258 --> 19:19.659
YOU KNOW IT!

19:19.659 --> 19:21.531
(man) NO WAY. WRONG BALLS!
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY!

19:21.531 --> 19:24.594
HEY, BUDDY.

19:24.594 --> 19:26.366
HERE YOU GO.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.368
THANKS, MR. WRONG BALLS.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.671
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
HE CALLED ME "MISTER."

19:31.671 --> 19:33.503
AW, THERE'S ALWAYS A FIRST.

19:33.503 --> 19:36.946
JULES, EMBARRASSING THINGS
HAPPEN TO ME A LOT.

19:36.946 --> 19:39.609
SO WHAT'S THE POINT
IN HIDING FROM IT?

19:39.609 --> 19:42.482
I JUST PUT ON A BIG SMILE,
AND I SAY, "I CHUMPED IT, WORLD,

19:42.482 --> 19:44.854
AND I THINK IT'S FUNNY, TOO."
AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

19:44.854 --> 19:47.257
BOOM, POP CULTURE PHENOM.

NOW THAT I'M FAMOUS, MY GOLF
LESSONS ARE BOOKED SOLID.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.525
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BUY
MY OWN DRINKS ANYMORE.
WELL, YOU NEVER DID THAT.

19:55.525 --> 19:57.467
WELL, NOW IT'S NOT STEALING.

WITH THE KIDS YESTERDAY.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.638
STUPID BLABBY TOWN.

20:08.638 --> 20:11.641
JUST REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T HEAR
THE WORLD LAUGHING AT YOU

20:11.641 --> 20:15.515
IF YOU'RE LAUGHING HARDER.

20:17.517 --> 20:21.220

NOW BEFORE I START READING,

20:27.397 --> 20:29.929
I THOUGHT WE WOULD DO
THE REAL PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.262
ALL RISE.

20:32.262 --> 20:35.265

I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG

20:35.265 --> 20:37.267
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

20:37.267 --> 20:42.542

FOR WHICH IT STANDS,

20:42.542 --> 20:46.876
ONE NATION, UNDER GOD,
INVISIBLE...

THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.

20:58.488 --> 21:00.590
I'VE NEVER SEEN GOD.
NO, I'VE NEVER
SEEN HIM EITHER.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.592
THAT'S SOMETHING
A JELLY BEAN WOULD SAY.
