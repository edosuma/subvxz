WEBVTT

00:23.880 --> 00:25.320
JAKE: Let's go! Come on, Charlie.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.720
We should do this.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.040
Okay, we see the wave,

00:33.080 --> 00:36.680
we turn in, paddle long and smooth,

00:36.720 --> 00:39.680
nose-to-tail. Now, we're going to get up.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.640
Plant the hands. Push up.

00:42.680 --> 00:44.120
Three, two, one...

00:44.920 --> 00:45.960
Plant them, plant them!

00:46.000 --> 00:47.080
-Keep low, low. -Yes!

00:47.120 --> 00:49.280
Yes! You can do this, Charlie.

00:50.440 --> 00:52.480
Just let it go, yeah?

00:52.520 --> 00:55.120
-Show them who you really are. -I can do that.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.280
-Good lad. -Hey, Jake!

00:57.320 --> 01:00.480
-Best it's been for weeks. You've got to get out there.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.480
-Yeah.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.520
Jess, run through it a couple more times,

01:06.560 --> 01:08.000
then take Charlie out. You're ready,

01:08.040 --> 01:09.480
but look after him.

01:09.520 --> 01:10.640
Sure thing.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.480
Hey, hey, hey.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.840
You busy?

01:13.880 --> 01:16.160
Er, let me see. I've got the laundry

01:13.880 --> 01:16.160
to finish.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.920
Dinner to prep. Pay some bills. Get the

01:16.200 --> 01:19.920
phone people out again.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.200
Nothing important, then.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.360
JAKE: This is what it's all about.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.280
Away from the things of man.

01:31.840 --> 01:34.760
You, me, the waves.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.000
You do know I love you, don't you?

01:39.840 --> 01:40.960
What have you done now?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.280
Way to ruin a moment.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.680
-Here she comes. Go hard... -Or go home!

01:55.600 --> 01:57.480
-I need to get back to work. -Hey!

01:59.600 --> 02:03.040
-Oh, no, no. It's fine.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.640
-Go on. -Cheeky!

03:11.880 --> 03:13.000
Smells good.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.480
You joining us?

03:14.520 --> 03:16.720
Oh, no, no, thanks.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.200
Not on poker night, no.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.880
So, where's Jake?

03:20.920 --> 03:22.280
In his man-cave.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.600
He knows you're coming over, he'll be out in a minute.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
Okay.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Well, I'll go and set the cards up.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.600
Excuse me.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.040
Oh, Karl, those pills you gave him for his back.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.040
They don't seem to be doing him much good.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.960
Yeah, well, I have brought some more for him in here.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.880
But you've just got to give it time.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.600
-He's not as young as he was, you know.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.600
-Mmm.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.200
-Don't tell him that. -No, no, I wouldn't dare!

04:02.640 --> 04:04.480
Jake? Jake!

04:04.520 --> 04:06.960
Jake! Are you okay? Jake!

04:11.320 --> 04:12.400
No!

04:14.960 --> 04:16.240
KARL: Jake, Jake...

04:18.440 --> 04:19.600
Jake...

04:19.640 --> 04:21.920
Oh, God, Jake! Jake! Jake!

05:07.080 --> 05:08.160
Sir?

05:10.600 --> 05:11.720
Sir?

05:14.080 --> 05:16.320
I don't suppose you know where he is?

05:22.160 --> 05:23.240
Huh!

05:33.800 --> 05:35.600
Oh, that's better! Mmm.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.120
I just, uh...

05:40.200 --> 05:41.520
I thought I'd get back into my running.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.240
Really?

05:43.280 --> 05:45.320
Yes, I was quite the distance specialist in my youth.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.920
Mmm-hmm.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.720
So, er, to what do I owe this pleasure, Camille?

05:50.600 --> 05:51.680
Murder.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.400
All right. Well, I'd better get changed.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.840
I'll be waiting outside.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.720
HUMPHREY: Right, what have we got?

06:09.760 --> 06:11.920
Where?

06:11.960 --> 06:14.320
-Sandy Cove Surf School. -Oh.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.080
So, why running all of a sudden?

06:16.120 --> 06:18.320
Oh, you know, uh, just need to do

06:16.120 --> 06:18.320
a bit of exercise,

06:18.360 --> 06:19.800
get back to my fighting weight.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.760
Are you trying to impress someone?

06:21.800 --> 06:25.040
Oh, gosh, no! No, no! Nothing like that,

06:21.800 --> 06:25.040
perish the thought!

06:25.080 --> 06:27.720
No, it's just that, uh... Well, I'm not getting

06:25.080 --> 06:27.720
any younger, am I?

06:28.440 --> 06:29.680
Time marches on.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.400
Oh, no.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.560
You're not in bad shape...

06:32.960 --> 06:34.000
Really?

06:34.680 --> 06:35.760
For your age.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.520
-Right.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.640
HUMPHREY: I seem to be wearing odd socks.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.360
Anything I need to know about the Inspector?

06:45.080 --> 06:48.360
How he likes to work?

06:48.400 --> 06:49.960
I do most of the heavy lifting,

06:50.000 --> 06:51.680
the detail work.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.600
He relies on me, I suppose.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.400
We are a well-oiled machine.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.680
Ah. This way.

06:58.720 --> 07:03.040
Our victim is Jake Peters. Former pro surfer,

06:58.720 --> 07:03.040
ran the school here.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.320
He was famous, apparently.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.640
The victim came in here around 4:00 to work.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.720
A gunshot was heard around 5:00.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.640
First person on the scene is Dr Slater, a friend

07:09.760 --> 07:13.640
of the deceased.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.920
He said when he came here, he found the door locked

07:13.680 --> 07:16.920
and had to break in.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.000
Yes, well, key's still in it. So definitely locked

07:16.960 --> 07:20.000
from the inside.

07:21.800 --> 07:22.920
Right!

07:22.960 --> 07:24.720
You can use mine if you want, sir.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.920
Oh, er, gosh, no, this'll do. Thank you.

07:30.480 --> 07:33.160
This is all rather impressive. I've never even heard of

07:30.480 --> 07:33.160
half of these places.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.520
Rincon Point, Manly Beach, Watergate Bay...

07:35.560 --> 07:39.120
Mr Peters was found dead, with a gunshot wound to the chest.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.960
There are powder burns, so it looks like

07:39.160 --> 07:41.960
it was point blank.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.080
There's no sign of the gun, but I found some nine

07:42.000 --> 07:47.080
millimetre bullets in here.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.840
They match this shell I found near the body.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.200
Shot with his own gun?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.520
Seems that way.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.560
I'll bag the evidence.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.080
When did it rain earlier?

07:57.120 --> 07:59.560
Um, 4:00, 4:30, I think.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.480
Before Mr Peters was killed.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.040
Hmm...

08:04.360 --> 08:06.080
So, robbery gone wrong, you think?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.680
It's what the evidence says, Chief.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.840
-HUMPHREY: Yeah. -The victim's wife

08:07.720 --> 08:09.840
says his silver chain

08:09.880 --> 08:12.960
and his watch are missing. Both worth a fair bit.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.360
And he's got marks on his neck where they

08:13.000 --> 08:15.360
pulled off his chain.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.320
Oh, yeah. He's right, sir.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.240
Sir!

08:23.360 --> 08:25.560
I found this near the body.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.280
Could be a link from the missing chain.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.840
Yes, good work, Dwayne.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.520
Thank you, Chief. Well, all seems

08:28.880 --> 08:31.520
fairly clear-cut.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.040
Please, go on.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.040
Ah, okay.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.120
DWAYNE: So...

08:39.160 --> 08:40.920
Mr Peters is in here working.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.800
Our thief comes in, either through

08:40.960 --> 08:43.800
the open back window,

08:43.840 --> 08:45.800
or the front door, locking it after them.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.400
The victim goes for his gun.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.840
There's a struggle.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.000
Look, some of the boards there have been knocked over.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.520
Yes, they all come in different shapes and

08:51.040 --> 08:53.520
sizes, don't they?

08:53.560 --> 08:55.680
Well, they're meant for different kinds of surf

08:55.720 --> 08:57.120
and varying skill levels.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.240
The voice of experience?

08:58.280 --> 09:01.240
Yes, I do love to surf. Don't you?

09:01.280 --> 09:04.360
Well, absolutely yes. Well, actually, when I say

09:01.280 --> 09:04.360
"yes," I mean "no."

09:04.400 --> 09:07.040
Actually, I've never surfed, I don't know why

09:04.400 --> 09:07.040
I said that, I panicked...

09:07.720 --> 09:09.360
Bang! The gun goes off.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.920
The assailant rips off the chain, takes the watch,

09:11.960 --> 09:15.120
-and then goes out the back window and gone.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.120
-Makes sense.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.880
Better check the traffic camera on the coast road.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.000
Already in hand.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.600
HUMPHREY: You're on fire today, Dwayne!

09:21.640 --> 09:22.880
Is it okay if I release the body now, Chief?

09:22.920 --> 09:24.400
HUMPHREY: Yes, don't see why not.

09:26.200 --> 09:28.720
Right, so, I think I can assert with some confidence

09:28.760 --> 09:32.000
that there are definitely only two ways into and

09:28.760 --> 09:32.000
out of this workshop.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.120
This door here was locked from the inside.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.720
So, by your theory, Dwayne,

09:35.760 --> 09:38.280
the killer must've left by the back window.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.960
It's the only way, Chief.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.800
There's just one small problem.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.440
If you care to look, the sand outside

09:42.840 --> 09:45.440
is not only wet,

09:45.480 --> 09:47.440
thanks to the shower before Mr Peters' death,

09:47.480 --> 09:49.920
but pretty much billiard-table flat.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.640
Not a single footprint nor mark of any kind.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.880
Which means that no one left through that way either.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.200
But that's impossible!

09:56.240 --> 09:57.880
Yes.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.160
Isn't it?

10:02.520 --> 10:05.520
Here you are. If we might have a word?

10:05.560 --> 10:06.960
You won't be needing me, will you?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.160
Er, no, please stay, Mr...

10:09.200 --> 10:12.120
Beckett. Charlie Beckett.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.680
Hi, Inspector, I'm Dr Karl Slater.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.080
Sorry, I was with the paramedics.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.280
And that's everyone, I take it?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.520
Mrs Peters?

10:21.560 --> 10:22.720
Yes.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.640
So, you teach surfing here?

10:24.680 --> 10:27.600
Yes, but Jake was the main draw

10:27.640 --> 10:30.200
and, er, I run the place.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.760
Charlie, Jess and Steve were our students.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.320
Uh, actually, I'm a pro.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.120
I'm just here for some fine tuning

10:34.360 --> 10:36.120
with the main man.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.280
Sorry, Steve's right, he's not really a student.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.880
He's already made a bit of a name for

10:38.320 --> 10:40.880
himself on the circuit.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.560
This just isn't fair.

10:46.680 --> 10:50.040
So, where were you all when you heard the shot?

10:50.080 --> 10:52.240
I was in the kitchen getting the dinner ready.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.000
I was just right over there, I ran straight over.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.760
Can't have been more than five seconds.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.440
I was down the beach, fancied a swim.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.280
In my camper van. Crashed out.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.920
I was just in the bedroom, there.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.560
So, you were all on your own?

11:09.200 --> 11:12.120
Doctor, you were first on the scene. The door was

11:09.200 --> 11:12.120
locked from the inside.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.600
You broke it down, finding Mr Peters deceased.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.200
Jake

11:17.240 --> 11:20.520
God, Jake, no! God, no.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.360
Mr Peters' watch and silver chain were missing?

11:25.600 --> 11:29.200
And no one could have been hiding in the workshop

11:25.600 --> 11:29.200
when you arrived?

11:29.240 --> 11:31.320
I don't see how. We would have noticed.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.160
We found some bullets in a drawer.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.560
Did Mr Peters own a gun?

11:37.600 --> 11:39.400
No, no way. He hated them.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.320
Erm, do you mind if we search the school?

11:44.360 --> 11:46.480
Of course.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.440
Thank you. That'll do for now, thank you.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.600
Ooh, one last thing.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.960
Mrs Peters, did your husband usually lock the door

11:57.000 --> 11:58.600
of his workshop when he was inside?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.480
I don't know, I'm not sure. Is that important?

12:03.040 --> 12:04.400
Probably not.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.120
Thank you.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.480
CAMILLE: <i> So,</i> <i>what do you think?</i>

12:17.520 --> 12:19.800
Mmm. Option one.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.720
A rogue burglar is confronted by Mr Peters,

12:21.760 --> 12:23.240
who is killed in a struggle and then robbed,

12:23.280 --> 12:25.400
before his assailant disappears into thin air.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.720
Or option two. Someone killed him and faked

12:25.440 --> 12:29.720
the burglary to throw us off.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.280
But how did the killer get away?

12:31.320 --> 12:33.160
The only way out was through the window

12:33.200 --> 12:35.680
and they would have left footprints in the wet sand.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.200
It doesn't make any sense.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.760
Yes, succinctly put, Dwayne.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.040
You know, we need that search. If it was someone here,

12:42.080 --> 12:44.280
then the gun and valuables can't have travelled far.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.960
Leave that with me, Chief.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.400
FLORENCE: I'll start at the schoolhouse.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.000
And I'll start down on the beach.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.080
Good.

12:54.920 --> 12:55.920
HUMPHREY: Ah.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.760
Is he wearing odd socks?

12:58.800 --> 13:00.200
Sure is.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.240
Ah!

13:09.120 --> 13:11.680
-You being so keen. -I don't know what you mean.

13:11.720 --> 13:16.120
-Dwayne! -Okay, she says she's

13:11.720 --> 13:16.120
heard things about me.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.800
And I don't need that!

13:17.840 --> 13:19.760
She'll be watching me all the time.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.560
-So, I need to show her the real Officer Dwayne Myers!

13:25.120 --> 13:27.120
Look, I need to make an impression,

13:27.160 --> 13:30.960
that way, I get a little wriggle room later on.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.880
This is not just a hat rack, you know?

13:34.280 --> 13:35.520
Sarge.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.120
HUMPHREY: You really think it'll work?

13:42.160 --> 13:44.000
Dwayne on his best behaviour

13:44.040 --> 13:45.240
CAMILLE: Not a chance!

13:48.600 --> 13:52.880
-No, I think I'll come at it

13:48.600 --> 13:52.880
fresh in the morning.

13:55.040 --> 13:58.520
And you

13:58.560 --> 14:01.680
I never did ask, did I

14:01.720 --> 14:03.400
Not good.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.840
-Oh. -As Maman says,

14:05.880 --> 14:08.680
"You have to kiss a lot of frogs before you

14:05.880 --> 14:08.680
find your prince."

14:08.720 --> 14:10.440
Oh, so, you did kiss him, then?

14:15.720 --> 14:17.360
Thank you for the beer.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.320
DWAYNE: Hmm.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.040
-No, nothing.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.560
It's mainly sea and jungle out there.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.960
No real chance of finding anything. And you?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.360
School's clean.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.080
Let's call it a night.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.280
If you say so, Sarge.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.000
So, what do you usually do when you finish?

14:55.040 --> 14:57.280
-I hear you're

14:55.040 --> 14:57.280
a bit of a party animal.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.080
Me? No. Tuesdays I help out

14:59.120 --> 15:00.880
at the church.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.200
-Polishing...

15:04.200 --> 15:05.360
Things.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.880
-Yes.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.040
DWAYNE: Okay, get the boys together.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.040
Bumpa Dupuis,

15:23.080 --> 15:25.160
Crazy Ali, Pete the Shaman.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.200
I'm looking for a gun and some jewellery.

15:27.240 --> 15:30.880
-He's funny.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.440
Trying to make out like he's Supercop,

15:33.480 --> 15:36.080
that he does virtually everything here.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.440
Last night, he told me he was going to help

15:36.120 --> 15:39.440
out at the church.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.960
Now, he's really trying to

15:39.480 --> 15:41.960
impress you.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.400
-I know. -So, are you going to tell him

15:42.000 --> 15:44.400
you're onto him?

15:44.440 --> 15:45.760
Now, where's the fun in that?

15:47.440 --> 15:49.800
The one I can't work out is the Inspector.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.440
Yeah, that takes time.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.720
-Morning. -BOTH: Morning!

15:55.480 --> 15:58.080
He may not look it, but he's brilliant.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.680
He thinks of things you wouldn't believe, and...

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
HUMPHREY: Oh...

16:01.720 --> 16:03.480
Well, he's also very, er...

16:05.320 --> 16:07.120
Very English.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.720
HUMPHREY: Ah, hm...

16:09.760 --> 16:11.040
Ooh...

16:11.080 --> 16:13.720
Right! Let's get cracking, shall we?

16:13.760 --> 16:15.480
Ooh, excellent board, nice and neat.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.640
-Courtesy of Officer Myers. -Ah. No problem, Chief.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.960
Just in at 6:00 and wanted to

16:18.680 --> 16:20.960
crack on as usual. Yes, of course.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.280
How very like you, Dwayne.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.080
So, any developments?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.360
Florence

16:27.400 --> 16:28.720
Florrie, Flo

16:28.760 --> 16:31.320
"Florence." -Florence, Florence.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.680
Nothing from the search.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.360
And there have been no other thefts in the area recently.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.520
Sarge...

16:40.240 --> 16:43.120
Well, there were no other vehicles coming in or out

16:43.160 --> 16:44.960
on the coast road camera.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.480
And the place is isolated. Water on one side,

16:45.000 --> 16:48.480
jungle on the other.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.400
It's too remote to get there on foot.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.920
And none of my contacts have any knowledge of a gun

16:52.960 --> 16:54.840
or valuables being offered for sale.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.960
Okay, if it's not random robbery, it must be someone

16:54.880 --> 16:57.960
at the surf school.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Right.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.720
Mr Peters goes into his workshop.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.560
A shot is heard and the doctor's there in moments.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.160
He breaks down the door which was locked from the inside

17:05.200 --> 17:06.600
and finds his friend dead,

17:06.640 --> 17:08.440
his watch and silver chain missing.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.400
His wife says he didn't own a gun,

17:10.440 --> 17:13.360
though there are bullets for one in a drawer, but

17:10.440 --> 17:13.360
no gun at the scene.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.160
-Which rules out suicide. -HUMPHREY: Indeed.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.040
Someone must have killed Mr Peters

17:17.080 --> 17:19.280
and then made their escape before the doctor's arrival,

17:19.320 --> 17:22.280
and yet, the only possible way out was through

17:19.320 --> 17:22.280
the back window,

17:22.320 --> 17:25.080
and there were no footprints in the wet sand outside.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.040
Are we missing something?

17:28.080 --> 17:30.680
Yeah, one of those things you know,

17:28.080 --> 17:30.680
but you don't know you know.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.160
What is that...

17:32.200 --> 17:35.040
"When you don't know what I am,

17:32.200 --> 17:35.040
then I am something.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.760
"When you do know, then I'm nothing."

17:37.800 --> 17:39.040
Or is it the other way round?

17:39.080 --> 17:40.760
"When you do know what I am, then I'm something.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.120
"When you don't know, then I'm nothing."

17:40.800 --> 17:43.120
Is that right?

17:43.160 --> 17:44.480
What are you talking about?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.440
I really have no idea, Camille.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.440
I thought I knew, but, uh...  Mind

17:46.480 --> 17:49.440
like a sieve sometimes.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.280
Let's focus on the people at the school.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.720
Indeed. Thank you, Camille.

17:52.760 --> 17:54.840
So, what about them?

17:54.880 --> 17:59.000
Jake's wife, Katie. Married over 20 years,

17:54.880 --> 17:59.000
toured the world with him.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.720
Set up the school four years ago.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.600
And the doctor friend who was first on the scene?

18:02.640 --> 18:06.120
Karl Slater. GP, successful practice

18:02.640 --> 18:06.120
in Port Royal.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.120
Known the deceased since infant school.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.360
Yes, seems a long time to wait to kill a best friend.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.280
So, no motives leaping out there.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.360
Keep digging. Erm, and the students?

18:14.400 --> 18:17.240
Charlie Beckett. Works in admin

18:14.400 --> 18:17.240
for a London firm.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.640
New to surfing.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.880
Thank you, Dwayne. Jessica Chambers?

18:20.920 --> 18:23.760
CAMILLE: Uh, 18, from Cornwall. On a year out

18:20.920 --> 18:23.760
before university.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.920
Also a beginner.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.440
And the local boy?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.920
Steve Taylor. Trying to make it

18:26.480 --> 18:28.920
as a pro surfer.

18:28.960 --> 18:32.320
The odd run-in as a juvenile, but nothing recent.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.400
Camille, do you have any contacts in surfer circles?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.320
An inside take on the world would be useful.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.520
Well, yes. Er, my friend Nicky surfs the Point all the time.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.440
-I'll make a call. -Excellent.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.840
Chief! You need to see this.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.520
It's the background checks from the Met.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.000
There's a flag on one of the files.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.920
Ah. Mr Beckett.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.360
He's wanted back home. For theft.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.840
He stole thousands and got out before they

18:55.400 --> 18:57.840
could issue the warrant.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.040
Well, maybe it was robbery

18:57.880 --> 19:00.040
after all.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.160
Come on, Camille!

19:04.520 --> 19:06.760
Is he usually like this?

19:06.800 --> 19:09.160
I mean, all the talking to himself

19:09.200 --> 19:11.720
and the things that don't seem to follow?

19:11.760 --> 19:14.840
Of course. All the time. That's the Chief.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.600
Let's face it, the guy's clever,

19:17.640 --> 19:19.240
even if he is a bit...

19:19.280 --> 19:21.120
-Exactly.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.400
Ah, Mr Beckett. We need a quick word.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.000
Small matter of a theft back in the UK.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.640
I wouldn't if I were you.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.640
I've recently taken up running again and you're

19:39.680 --> 19:41.640
wearing flip-flops.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.840
I've got this!

19:48.200 --> 19:49.360
Ah!

19:58.720 --> 20:01.560
Yes, I went off a bit quick there. Not really cut

19:58.720 --> 20:01.560
out for the sprint.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.720
I'm less Linford Christie and more Mo Farah.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.280
Need to build up a head of steam...

20:05.320 --> 20:06.840
If you say so.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.440
Anyway, er, well done!

20:08.480 --> 20:09.560
Oh, ow!

20:19.760 --> 20:21.400
Want a hand going through the prints?

20:21.440 --> 20:22.960
That's a lot of work.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.560
No need. I love doing this stuff.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.640
Okay. If you say so.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.600
All right, I shouldn't have run, but you've

20:38.640 --> 20:40.600
got the wrong man.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
Oh, you didn't steal thousands of pounds?

20:42.680 --> 20:44.160
It's a valid question.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.920
If you are a thief and we have robbery resulting in murder,

20:46.960 --> 20:48.560
then suddenly you become our prime suspect.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
-Of course not!

20:50.640 --> 20:52.480
-No!

20:52.520 --> 20:55.680
You're a thief on the run and now a man is dead.

20:55.720 --> 20:59.840
Look, I took the money,

20:55.720 --> 20:59.840
in England.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.840
-But I didn't mean to. Not really.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.840
-I'm not sure I follow you.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.200
I'd been at Michelson's 22 years.

21:06.240 --> 21:09.920
I did everything asked of me. Worked all hours, no overtime.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.040
Then they tell me the company's

21:09.960 --> 21:12.040
been taken over,

21:12.080 --> 21:15.440
and I'm out on my ear, but there was no redundancy.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.360
The union was useless.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.840
Nothing I could do about it.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.520
Just sat there, killing the last few hours

21:18.880 --> 21:21.520
on the Internet.

21:21.560 --> 21:24.960
And then I saw this place. It looked amazing.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.400
I still had the company

21:25.000 --> 21:26.400
credit card.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.200
And it paid for you to come out here?

21:28.240 --> 21:29.520
Three weeks in paradise.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.400
Did you think you'd get away with that?

21:31.440 --> 21:33.840
Well, to be honest, I wasn't really thinking.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.560
Yeah.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.440
But it was the best decision I ever made.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.400
Even if you go to prison?

21:39.440 --> 21:42.200
Yes. I met Jake, didn't I?

21:42.240 --> 21:44.000
He really wanted me to get it,

21:44.040 --> 21:45.960
to feel what it's like out there.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.400
He was such an inspiration.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.000
It sounds like you got on well with him.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.800
Well, there was only two of us, so we spent

21:50.040 --> 21:52.800
a lot of time together.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.240
Is that usual? Only two students.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.760
Don't suppose so, but it was great.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.600
I mean, Jess is way better than a beginner,

21:59.640 --> 22:01.440
so he just focused on me.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.240
Look, if you want to take me in,

22:04.440 --> 22:07.240
then so be it.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.040
No regrets. Jake taught me that.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.240
Maybe not right now. If you'll surrender

22:11.080 --> 22:14.240
your passport to us,

22:14.280 --> 22:16.080
and guarantee your return home,

22:16.120 --> 22:18.120
we'll put you on a flight in due course.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.600
-Yeah.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.280
Yes, but you are still a material witness

22:22.320 --> 22:24.360
and a suspect in a murder inquiry.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.480
He's hardly a master criminal.

22:30.520 --> 22:31.960
But admits to theft.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.240
Well, you saw Jess Chambers. She seemed keen to avoid us.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.120
Didn't you also think it odd, what he said,

22:37.160 --> 22:39.880
that there's no way she's a beginner.

22:37.160 --> 22:39.880
Why pretend?

22:39.920 --> 22:43.040
She wanted to be here for some other reason.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.680
Jake, maybe? He was an attractive man.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.480
HUMPHREY: Mmm. Married though.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.960
Dr Slater. One quick question. And we do need to ask,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.640
tricky though it might be.

22:53.680 --> 22:57.280
Uh, Mr and Mrs Peters, their marriage. Was it a

22:53.680 --> 22:57.280
happy one, do you think?

22:59.520 --> 23:02.640
They were devoted to each other.

23:02.680 --> 23:06.120
And shouldn't you be out there looking for the thief

23:02.680 --> 23:06.120
that killed Jake?

23:06.160 --> 23:08.640
Rather than hounding those that are grieving for him?

23:13.280 --> 23:14.440
Touchy!

23:16.240 --> 23:17.320
FLORENCE: Sir

23:17.360 --> 23:19.080
The post mortem's in.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.800
A nine millimetre bullet was recovered

23:19.120 --> 23:21.800
from the heart.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.040
Death almost instantaneous.

23:24.080 --> 23:28.160
Gunshot residue on the victim is consistent with being shot

23:24.080 --> 23:28.160
at close range in a struggle.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.000
I've been through these now, Chief.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.840
All the fingerprints at the workshop

23:31.880 --> 23:34.160
either belong to the victim or those who we know

23:31.880 --> 23:34.160
were at the school.

23:34.200 --> 23:36.120
And Jake Peters' fingerprints are on the bullets.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.680
Implying that he might well have had a gun,

23:36.160 --> 23:38.680
though the wife denies it.

23:38.720 --> 23:39.920
So where is it?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.600
That, and our killer appears to have vanished.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.280
We know they had to be in the workshop.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.640
Mr Peters' death tells us that.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.640
So how did they get out?

23:48.720 --> 23:50.960
Do we have anything else on Jess Chambers?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.440
FLORENCE: Nothing exciting.

23:52.480 --> 23:55.760
She lives with her mum near Watergate Bay, Cornwall,

23:55.800 --> 23:58.480
member of the surf club there.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.640
Dig into the finances of the school,

23:58.520 --> 24:01.640
and Mr and Mrs Peters.

24:01.680 --> 24:05.280
Having only two students doesn't seem a very viable

24:01.680 --> 24:05.280
business model to me.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.680
-Will do, sir. -Hang on,

24:07.720 --> 24:10.280
did you just say something about Watergate Bay?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.600
Yes. Jess Chambers is from round there.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.440
Now, why does that ring a bell?

24:14.480 --> 24:18.280
Manly Beach, Watergate Bay.

24:14.480 --> 24:18.280
Aha! Yes!

24:18.320 --> 24:20.080
Jake here receiving an honourary award

24:20.120 --> 24:23.240
last year at the Surf Festival in Watergate Bay.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.600
So, he and Jess have both been there.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.960
You think he knew her before? She never mentioned it.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.320
People lie when they have something to hide.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.840
CAMILLE: I'll do a search. "Jake Peters, Watergate Bay."

24:36.880 --> 24:39.080
Yeah. The local paper covered it.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.160
Look at this!

24:42.600 --> 24:45.760
There's Jake and that's Jess Chambers.

24:48.920 --> 24:52.640
Dr Slater was rather defensive when I suggested their

24:48.920 --> 24:52.640
marriage might not be happy.

24:52.680 --> 24:55.120
But would they risk it

24:55.160 --> 24:56.960
Maybe that's what got him killed.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.040
Yes... So, why did you come out here?

25:01.080 --> 25:03.920
To this particular school?

25:05.560 --> 25:08.360
JESS: I just wanted to learn from the best.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.200
And this was the first time you met Jake?

25:11.520 --> 25:12.640
Yes.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.200
HUMPHREY: And you've never surfed before?

25:14.800 --> 25:16.120
No. Why?

25:16.160 --> 25:20.640
It's just that you look every inch the surfer girl,

25:20.680 --> 25:22.560
and that definitely looks like Jake.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.440
CAMILLE: You were dazzled by him,

25:22.600 --> 25:25.440
weren't you?

25:25.480 --> 25:27.760
He was away from home and his wife.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.600
It's easy to see how an affair could start.

25:29.640 --> 25:32.240
-Perhaps it ended badly.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.000
-Or his wife found out. -No, you've got

25:32.280 --> 25:35.000
this all wrong.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.800
Then why did you have to kill him?

25:36.840 --> 25:39.240
Kill him I just wanted

25:36.840 --> 25:39.240
to get to know him!

25:39.280 --> 25:40.480
Why?

25:44.840 --> 25:46.360
Look, back home,

25:46.400 --> 25:48.640
I never spoke to him.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.040
And then, when I saw him there,

25:50.080 --> 25:52.280
I told Mum and I didn't even know that she knew him...

25:54.160 --> 25:57.000
She never said a word. She always told me that

25:54.160 --> 25:57.000
it didn't matter.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.160
And I just wanted to know, I suppose.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.440
Jake was your father.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.880
Mum told me about their wild summer together.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.720
How she felt so alive, and nothing else mattered.

26:17.120 --> 26:18.840
She didn't know she was pregnant, not then.

26:18.880 --> 26:21.640
But she knew he was married.

26:23.720 --> 26:24.960
So, it was just me and her.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.040
And that was fine until I knew.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.240
I just, I wanted to know him, that's all.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.120
I wanted to know who I was.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.680
So you came out here?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.320
And you told him?

26:42.560 --> 26:44.760
The day after I arrived.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.640
<i>He was cool, actually.</i> <i>Sweet.</i>

26:46.680 --> 26:51.320
<i>But he said he couldn't</i> <i>be a father to me.</i>

26:52.520 --> 26:54.520
And you were you okay with that?

26:54.560 --> 26:58.480
Well, I tried to be, but once I knew,

26:58.520 --> 27:01.040
I couldn't just let it go and I kept hoping.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.240
And then,

27:04.280 --> 27:07.200
yesterday, before he died, I went to see him.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.160
<i>I just wanted him</i> <i>to change his mind.</i>

27:12.320 --> 27:14.000
I can't do this now.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.880
But, he said that

27:16.920 --> 27:20.480
knowing him would only bring me grief.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.440
And he was right, wasn't he?

27:29.000 --> 27:30.760
CAMILLE: You should have told us about it.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.040
We thought it best not to.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.320
"We?"

27:36.960 --> 27:38.320
Katie and me.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.760
His wife knew? Yeah. Jake told her.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.800
Right!

27:46.840 --> 27:50.000
"If you don't know me, then I'm something.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.360
"If you do know, then I'm nothing."

27:52.400 --> 27:53.600
Huh?

27:53.640 --> 27:55.120
Something the Inspector said. I wonder what it means?

27:59.720 --> 28:02.480
Believe me, I wouldn't try and get into the Chief's head,

27:59.720 --> 28:02.480
you know?

28:03.960 --> 28:06.560
So, how did your polishing go last night?

28:09.800 --> 28:11.920
Ah... Excellent!

28:11.960 --> 28:14.280
Very well. Everything is just...

28:14.320 --> 28:17.160
-Yes, it is!

28:19.720 --> 28:21.720
We need to catalogue and cross reference

28:21.760 --> 28:23.040
the evidence from the scene.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.240
You do catalogue the evidence?

28:28.280 --> 28:32.080
-Of course! All the time.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.600
I'll finish checking out the surf school while

28:43.480 --> 28:46.600
you polish that off.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.320
The kid had enough to deal with.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.400
You concealed vital information.

28:58.440 --> 29:00.840
How's it vital

29:01.640 --> 29:02.920
Jess is 18 years old,

29:02.960 --> 29:04.560
you've been married over 20 years.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.040
Your husband was unfaithful.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.680
She's the walking, talking proof.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.240
You must see that as a possible motive for murder.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.440
You think I'd kill Jake for playing around?

29:16.080 --> 29:17.840
Jess's mum was beautiful.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.640
She liked partying. For Jake, life was for living,

29:17.880 --> 29:20.640
to be experienced.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.320
You knew?

29:24.360 --> 29:27.240
He never lied to me. That's who he was.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.520
He was true to himself. Jake liked women and

29:27.280 --> 29:29.520
they liked him.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.280
-Course I minded!

29:33.320 --> 29:35.480
The pain doesn't go away, you just

29:33.320 --> 29:35.480
learn to deal with it.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.600
Do you think that was why he rejected her?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.240
For the sake of your marriage?

29:41.280 --> 29:44.760
No. It was a surprise for both of us.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.040
But I was cool with it,

29:46.080 --> 29:47.160
I thought Jake would go for it,

29:47.200 --> 29:49.680
but he just, he said it would never work.

29:55.320 --> 29:58.440
She's got motive, but we need to know how she

29:55.320 --> 29:58.440
could have done it.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.200
How could she vanish into thin air?

30:01.040 --> 30:02.200
-Right! -Eh! Eh!

30:04.000 --> 30:05.640
Right. I'm locked in.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.680
HUMPHREY: There must be

30:07.720 --> 30:09.680
another way out.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.720
Oh! Hey, Nicky!

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Oh, hang on, this panel's loose...

30:24.040 --> 30:25.360
You got the message?

30:25.400 --> 30:27.960
Yes, I know. Long time.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.240
Yes, yes!

30:30.280 --> 30:31.440
I just need to talk to you.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.920
-Yes! -Shh!

30:32.960 --> 30:34.600
Oh, just a little further...

30:35.880 --> 30:37.200
Yes...

30:37.240 --> 30:38.400
Ah!

30:39.320 --> 30:40.800
I appear somewhat stuck.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.120
Ah, sorry...

30:52.160 --> 30:56.040
Camille, a hand, please?

30:56.080 --> 30:59.000
Well, yes, sure, see you there. Right.

31:00.800 --> 31:01.920
Please hurry!

31:05.360 --> 31:06.560
Ah! Of course.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.280
I think there's something alive down here!

31:10.200 --> 31:11.400
Sir? I'm down here!

31:13.960 --> 31:15.200
Oh.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.400
I'm just saying, I didn't see anything.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.640
Well, I definitely felt something.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.480
-Dwayne's made a breakthrough, sir.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.240
Chief?

31:25.280 --> 31:27.280
Right, what am I looking at?

31:27.320 --> 31:29.440
I was cataloguing and cross-checking

31:27.320 --> 31:29.440
the crime scene evidence...

31:29.480 --> 31:31.120
Like I always do.

31:31.160 --> 31:33.960
And I noticed that the pills on the scene were

31:31.160 --> 31:33.960
only a month old,

31:34.000 --> 31:35.840
prescribed by Dr Slater,

31:35.880 --> 31:37.520
but according to Jake's medical records,

31:37.560 --> 31:39.240
he hadn't seen the doctor in over a year.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.400
So, I get to thinking, why aren't they mentioned?

31:42.440 --> 31:44.160
Riluzole? Never heard of it.

31:44.200 --> 31:47.200
I looked it up. It's an FDA-approved

31:44.200 --> 31:47.200
drug to alleviate...

31:48.560 --> 31:50.360
Am-yo-trop... No, wait...

31:50.400 --> 31:52.480
Amy-o-tropic... Amy...

31:53.640 --> 31:55.040
That, Chief!

31:55.080 --> 31:57.400
-Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.400
-Yeah, what I said.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.320
"A progressive neuro-degenerative disease

31:59.360 --> 32:01.720
"affecting the brain and spinal cord."

32:01.760 --> 32:03.760
Wait, you said "alleviate," not cure?

32:03.800 --> 32:05.320
Apparently, there is no cure.

32:05.360 --> 32:09.520
Right, so, some time before he was actually murdered,

32:09.560 --> 32:12.640
Jake Peters was diagnosed with a terminal illness.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.600
We'd better pay the doctor a visit.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.200
HUMPHREY: Yes.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.960
I just... I can't think why you'd need to talk to me.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.880
I told you what happened, and all I can think of.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.040
Tell us about these.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.160
Look, I never wanted to lie about them.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.680
I had to.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.200
He made me promise.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.640
So, Jake was dying.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.600
Yeah.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.600
I think you'd better start from the beginning.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.720
KARL: A few months back, uh, Jake came to see me.

32:52.760 --> 32:57.080
Just a check-up really, I think he'd been

32:52.760 --> 32:57.080
feeling his age.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.720
<i>I never expected anything</i> <i>to be wrong with him,</i>

32:59.760 --> 33:01.040
<i>but we did the tests.</i>

33:01.080 --> 33:03.800
<i>And at first, I thought</i> <i>it was a mistake.</i>

33:03.840 --> 33:06.800
<i>Jake was always so fit,</i> <i>so alive.</i>

33:06.840 --> 33:08.600
<i>So, I did the tests again.</i>

33:08.640 --> 33:10.640
<i>Same results. No mistake.</i>

33:12.040 --> 33:13.880
It's not your fault. <i>There was nothing I could do.</i>

33:17.680 --> 33:20.640
Did Katie know

33:20.680 --> 33:22.760
No, he didn't want her to know.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.960
That was the promise.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.680
And you were happy with that?

33:26.720 --> 33:29.360
Well, yeah, you didn't... You don't know me and Jake.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.160
We always kept each other's secrets,

33:32.200 --> 33:33.720
we always told each other everything.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.120
We've done that since we were kids.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.440
We were like brothers.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.760
He was always there for me.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.680
And the one time that he needed me...

33:43.720 --> 33:45.400
And yet, you knew nothing about the gun?

33:46.480 --> 33:48.640
No, no. Why, why, why...

33:48.680 --> 33:50.000
He wouldn't ask me, would he?

33:50.040 --> 33:51.280
I mean, I'm a doctor after all.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.280
I took an oath to protect life.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.200
So, where might he have got it from?

33:57.360 --> 33:58.360
Bah...

33:59.800 --> 34:02.320
Steve, maybe?

34:02.360 --> 34:05.640
But no, no, no, 'cause Jake said Steve was out of all that

34:05.680 --> 34:08.360
and Steve's a good lad.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.200
Are you sure that the gun belonged to Jake?

34:11.240 --> 34:12.640
Yes, it would appear so.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.120
Am I in trouble for this?

34:18.160 --> 34:20.760
-You should have told us. -Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.960
Does Katie really need to know about this?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.720
I mean, that's what Jake wanted,

34:25.000 --> 34:27.720
was to spare her that.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.440
HUMPHREY: Where does all this leave us?

34:34.480 --> 34:36.560
What are the odds of a man with a terminal illness

34:36.600 --> 34:39.840
being murdered before he can die of said terminal illness.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.200
I'd say really, really big.

34:41.240 --> 34:44.280
Quite. That doesn't help, does it?

34:44.320 --> 34:46.440
Only one person seems to have known about it,

34:46.480 --> 34:48.400
and, logically, that should rule him out.

34:48.440 --> 34:53.200
I mean, if he wanted him dead, surely, he'd

34:48.440 --> 34:53.200
just wait for him to die.

34:53.240 --> 34:54.840
We need to focus.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.120
We may have motives... Adultery, abandonment,

34:54.880 --> 34:58.120
possibly,

34:58.160 --> 35:01.320
but none of that gets us closer to answering

34:58.160 --> 35:01.320
the central question.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.920
The only way out of the workshop was through

35:01.360 --> 35:03.920
the open window.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.000
Yes, but no one could have gone that way

35:06.040 --> 35:08.720
-or they would have left footprints in the wet sand.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.720
-Exactly!

35:08.760 --> 35:12.360
Someone appears to be cleverer than us and they're watching

35:08.760 --> 35:12.360
us go around in circles.

35:12.400 --> 35:15.840
We need evidence. We need the gun. It might

35:12.400 --> 35:15.840
still be at the school!

35:15.880 --> 35:17.280
We searched the whole place.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.000
Camille could be right.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.840
It may be well hidden, but my guess is it's still there.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.760
Whoever has it, they'll want to get rid of it.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.200
You think they'll try and move it tonight?

35:27.560 --> 35:29.120
Yeah, you're right.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.600
Any volunteers?

35:32.680 --> 35:35.880
Ey, ey, there's no need to ask, Chief!

35:32.680 --> 35:35.880
I'll head over there

35:35.920 --> 35:38.280
and I'll grab a bite on the way.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.360
-And I'll take over at midnight.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.360
-Great!

35:40.400 --> 35:42.800
And I'd better head over to Dante Point.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.080
See what my friend Nicky knows.

35:44.120 --> 35:45.400
Ah, is that your surfer friend?

35:45.440 --> 35:48.680
Mind if I tag along, get a feel for the scene?

35:48.720 --> 35:50.480
As long as you don't call it "the scene."

35:53.800 --> 35:55.080
Okay!

36:06.680 --> 36:08.240
Nicky!

36:08.280 --> 36:09.640
Cam!

36:09.680 --> 36:11.320
Hey! -Hey.

36:13.760 --> 36:17.120
Sir. This is my very good friend, Nick Dexter.

36:17.160 --> 36:20.600
-Everyone knows me as Nicky. -Apparently so.

36:20.640 --> 36:23.000
That's a good solid grip you've got there, Nicky.

36:23.040 --> 36:26.960
Hey, we need to talk about Jake Peters

36:23.040 --> 36:26.960
and Steve Taylor.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.600
Here's me hoping you'd just come to see me.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.120
Come, let's get a drink. I taught this girl to surf,

36:29.640 --> 36:33.120
you know?

36:33.160 --> 36:35.640
-Uh-huh! -Yes, of course you did.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.080
Yeah, he used to come here all the time.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.480
Yes, what was he like?

37:07.520 --> 37:09.560
The legendary Jake Peters?

37:09.600 --> 37:12.280
Well, he wasn't a legend round here.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.280
He was just Jake.

37:12.320 --> 37:14.320
-That's why he used to come. -Mmm-hmm.

37:14.360 --> 37:17.880
-Yeah, he seems okay.

37:17.920 --> 37:21.720
I mean, he used to be a bit of a bad lad,

37:17.920 --> 37:21.720
but he got some focus.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.400
Can you ask around maybe?

37:23.440 --> 37:25.400
See what you can dig up, please?

37:25.440 --> 37:26.800
What's in it for me?

37:26.840 --> 37:28.880
The eternal gratitude of law enforcement.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.080
Huh?

37:49.960 --> 37:50.960
Uh...

38:08.160 --> 38:09.720
Try that, Humphrey.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.720
Oh. Erm...

38:12.400 --> 38:14.960
It's very, er, green.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Mmm. What's in it?

38:17.040 --> 38:18.680
Mainly green things. Well, it makes

38:18.720 --> 38:20.360
sense, I suppose.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.160
Tastes green, too.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.360
I wondered, would you join me,

38:27.000 --> 38:29.360
Catherine?

38:29.400 --> 38:30.440
Hmm.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.320
I've been pondering Camille.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.000
-Oh, erm, well...

38:39.160 --> 38:43.400
You know, we got talking earlier about her date.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.080
-Didn't go well, apparently. -Oh, they never do.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.360
-And I met Nicky. -Oh, I loved him.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.520
Yes, I'm sure.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.680
But that didn't work out either, did it?

38:55.480 --> 38:56.760
Why is that?

38:56.800 --> 38:57.840
I mean...

38:59.440 --> 39:01.560
She's clever, beautiful.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.840
But she's on her own. Why?

39:05.960 --> 39:08.360
What is it that she's looking for, do you think?

39:09.520 --> 39:11.120
The men she's been out with,

39:11.160 --> 39:14.160
some are so handsome, so beautiful.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.840
And there have been some real brains...

39:15.880 --> 39:17.760
Doctors, architects...

39:17.800 --> 39:21.320
And some are so funny, charming.

39:21.360 --> 39:25.960
But none of them was enough for my Cammy. And why?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.320
Only she knows,

39:29.520 --> 39:32.000
but she obviously wants something more.

39:33.720 --> 39:35.240
Maybe not just a man

39:35.280 --> 39:38.400
who excites her and who she can admire,

39:38.440 --> 39:42.880
but maybe also a man who can inspire her.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.720
Not a tall order, then.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.000
Yes, more green.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.480
How long have you been asleep?

40:13.520 --> 40:17.200
Oh, you know, only a minute.

40:22.160 --> 40:24.160
Look, I couldn't help it, okay?

40:24.200 --> 40:25.920
I was just trying to rest my eyes.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.080
I'm just a bit tired, that's all.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.200
I'm not surprised.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.040
You've spent the last two days running around,

40:35.080 --> 40:38.840
volunteering for everything, trying to make me think

40:35.080 --> 40:38.840
you're RoboCop.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.720
You don't need to impress me.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.160
I've heard all about the infamous Dwayne Myers.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.680
Oh, no...

40:46.720 --> 40:50.640
Some bad. But most of it good.

40:50.680 --> 40:52.000
-Mmm-hmm.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.280
You're a solid officer, Dwayne.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.800
Unorthodox, but you get results.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.760
And that's good enough for me.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.560
You could've said something sooner.

41:13.960 --> 41:16.160
-Morning. -Morning.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.840
-No, sir.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.760
Ah, pity. Well, worth a try.

41:21.800 --> 41:24.080
Florence does have some news, sir.

41:24.120 --> 41:26.920
Yeah, I finished the school financials, like you asked.

41:26.960 --> 41:30.080
They are nearly bankrupt. They owe all their suppliers,

41:30.120 --> 41:33.080
they have two mortgages and are behind on both.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.720
But there is one thing of particular interest.

41:35.760 --> 41:39.040
A life-insurance policy taken out only

41:35.760 --> 41:39.040
three weeks ago.

41:39.080 --> 41:43.440
It covers Jake Peters for accidental death,

41:39.080 --> 41:43.440
including murder.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.640
Now he's dead.

41:45.680 --> 41:47.680
His wife gets half a million dollars.

41:48.680 --> 41:49.840
Hmm.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.880
I really don't know what you're talking about!

41:53.920 --> 41:56.440
-That's rather hard to believe.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.440
-No, I'm telling the truth.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.680
You've kept things back before.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.560
That was different, it was personal!

41:59.600 --> 42:01.240
You always seem to have an excuse.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.640
Your husband's having an affair.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.960
-I wouldn't kill him for that! -So you claim.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.920
Now, we discover you're practically bankrupt.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.720
And all your money worries are gone thanks

42:06.960 --> 42:09.720
to a life insurance policy

42:09.760 --> 42:11.960
conveniently taken out only a few weeks ago.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
Jake must have done it, but it's not like him.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
Not at all...

42:15.320 --> 42:16.600
Why?

42:16.640 --> 42:18.440
Look, the business wasn't doing great

42:18.480 --> 42:21.480
but Jake wasn't interested in that side of things.

42:21.520 --> 42:24.600
He loved teaching, but really he just wanted to surf.

42:24.640 --> 42:28.840
He even talked about going back on the circuit

42:24.640 --> 42:28.840
a few months ago.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.760
He went off the idea, said he always needed

42:28.880 --> 42:31.760
to be the best.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.360
We would have got by somehow. We always did.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.560
I could never hurt him, as much as he hurt me.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.920
I just... I wanted to grow old with him.

42:40.960 --> 42:43.360
But that wouldn't have happened, would it?

42:44.040 --> 42:45.120
What do you mean?

42:48.080 --> 42:50.160
Jake was diagnosed with a terminal condition.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.480
What are you talking about?

42:52.520 --> 42:54.280
You didn't notice him taking his pills?

42:54.320 --> 42:55.520
They were for his back.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.160
-They were to ease his symptoms.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.160
-No.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.720
You must have seen he wasn't well.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.000
No. Really. There was nothing.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.560
The day he died. The surf was perfect...

43:05.600 --> 43:07.480
It was just us out there, no cares...

43:09.440 --> 43:10.480
He was so alive!

43:16.280 --> 43:18.040
Why didn't he tell me?

43:18.080 --> 43:20.520
Dr Slater said Jake didn't want you to know.

43:20.560 --> 43:23.600
What, Karl knew? Of course he did! Typical!

43:23.640 --> 43:24.800
What do you mean by that?

43:27.200 --> 43:29.320
Karl never really liked me.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.320
Kept his distance, was awkward around me,

43:31.360 --> 43:35.040
like I wasn't good enough. He didn't even

43:31.360 --> 43:35.040
come to our wedding.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.320
But Jake, he...

43:40.240 --> 43:41.440
He should've told me.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.440
-Hard to know

43:47.160 --> 43:49.440
when she keeps lying.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.280
But we still need to know how she could have done it.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.880
Oh, hey, Nicky...

43:58.640 --> 44:00.760
Yeah. What have you got for us?

44:14.920 --> 44:16.160
Hey.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.480
Hey.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.240
Okay, so, what have you got?

44:27.280 --> 44:29.360
Well, I asked about like you said.

44:29.400 --> 44:32.760
Uh, most said Steve's okay. But a couple of guys

44:29.400 --> 44:32.760
at Shark Bay

44:32.800 --> 44:35.920
-said that he's bad news and to stay clear.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.240
They said he was trying to get his hands on a gun.

44:37.280 --> 44:39.360
-Ah! -No questions asked.

44:39.400 --> 44:40.880
Now, why would he want a gun?

44:40.920 --> 44:42.960
Well, I can think of one very good reason.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.840
Thank you, Nicky, you may have just helped

44:43.000 --> 44:45.840
us catch our killer.

44:45.880 --> 44:48.600
-Always happy to help law enforcement.

44:45.880 --> 44:48.600
-Come on, Camille.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.480
Does he actually own a shirt?

45:10.080 --> 45:11.640
You'd better come inside.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.760
I think it's time we searched Steve Taylor's camper van.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.280
-It's open. -Mmm-hmm.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.560
So, technically, we don't need a warrant.

45:30.600 --> 45:34.160
Quite right. Go on, then, but be quick about it.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.280
Ah, there's something here.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.360
Bingo!

46:05.400 --> 46:07.040
What are you doing?

46:07.080 --> 46:09.480
Care to explain this, Steve?

46:10.720 --> 46:12.440
Oh. Ugh...

46:12.480 --> 46:13.760
Be my guest.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.880
Now, that's my kind of speed.

46:52.600 --> 46:53.720
Well done.

46:57.960 --> 47:00.320
Well, it's not smoking, but it's definitely a gun.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.520
Nine millimetre. Just like the murder weapon.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.840
-Ballistics will match it. -It's nothing to do with me.

47:04.880 --> 47:06.760
Then we won't find your fingerprints on it, then?

47:06.800 --> 47:09.280
You wanted a gun. You got it, and you killed Jake. Why?

47:09.320 --> 47:11.760
Look, okay, so, I got the gun.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.800
That's why my prints might be on it.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.800
But I got it for Jake.

47:14.840 --> 47:16.600
I owed him, so I couldn't say no.

47:16.640 --> 47:17.880
Why would Jake want a gun?

47:17.920 --> 47:19.680
He said there'd been some break-ins.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.160
That he was worried for Katie.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.400
-He just wanted it for protection.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.400
-You're lying.

47:23.440 --> 47:26.040
We know there haven't been any other break-ins

47:23.440 --> 47:26.040
in the area.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.560
That's what he told me!

47:27.600 --> 47:30.000
We found the gun and Jake's stolen valuables

47:27.600 --> 47:30.000
in your van

47:30.040 --> 47:32.560
and you evaded arrest.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.680
I panicked, okay? Seeing you both

47:32.600 --> 47:35.680
there with that lot.

47:35.720 --> 47:40.000
But I had nothing to do with killing Jake.

47:35.720 --> 47:40.000
You have to believe me.

47:44.800 --> 47:48.120
He's called a lawyer, we need to decide

47:44.800 --> 47:48.120
if we're charging him.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.840
An hour ago, you'd say everything

47:48.160 --> 47:50.840
pointed to the wife.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.760
Now, all the evidence points to Steve.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.040
Yes, but why'd he do it?

47:54.080 --> 47:56.440
I mean, what's his motive?

47:56.480 --> 47:59.280
And how'd he get out of the workshop without

47:56.480 --> 47:59.280
using the window?

47:59.320 --> 48:02.080
See we know fragments, motives, secrets...

48:02.120 --> 48:04.600
But we don't know the bigger picture.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.800
What don't we know?

48:09.360 --> 48:12.480
"If you don't know what I am, then I am something.

48:12.520 --> 48:14.880
"If you do know, then I'm nothing."

48:16.440 --> 48:18.640
That's it! It's a riddle.

48:18.680 --> 48:19.800
We guessed that, Chief.

48:19.840 --> 48:23.720
No! The answer to the riddle is "a riddle."

48:23.760 --> 48:25.480
-That's stupid. -No, it's brilliant!

48:25.520 --> 48:27.400
The work of a brilliantly twisted mind

48:27.440 --> 48:30.720
hiding the all-too-obvious in plain sight.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.000
Can it really be that simple? If you look at it that way...

48:37.560 --> 48:38.760
Follow the chain of evidence.

48:40.360 --> 48:42.320
Yes, and that gives us our how.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.480
<i>That's where they were.</i>

48:46.080 --> 48:47.720
And our who.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.120
But the why.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.280
The why...

48:54.600 --> 48:56.800
Yes! You said it, Camille.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.200
<i>It all points to the wife.</i>

48:59.240 --> 49:01.640
That's why the door was locked!

49:01.680 --> 49:03.240
He knows who did it.

49:03.280 --> 49:05.160
So, who are we arresting?

49:05.200 --> 49:07.320
That's not how we do things around here.

49:07.360 --> 49:09.320
We just need to talk to the pathologist.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.560
You're sure about this?

49:17.600 --> 49:19.840
Relax. Let the Chief do his thing.

49:31.160 --> 49:32.360
Good afternoon.

49:34.280 --> 49:37.040
Um, thank you all

49:34.280 --> 49:37.040
for coming.

49:38.520 --> 49:43.560
Um, we're here to solve an impossible crime.

49:43.600 --> 49:47.560
<i>Two days ago, Jake Peters</i> <i>entered his workshop alone.</i>

49:49.160 --> 49:51.480
<i>A shot is heard. The first on</i> <i>the scene finds him dead.</i>

49:51.520 --> 49:54.560
<i>His jewellery gone,</i> <i>the victim of</i>

49:51.520 --> 49:54.560
<i>an apparent robbery.</i>

49:54.600 --> 49:56.000
The door was locked from the inside,

49:56.040 --> 49:58.680
so the killer had to have left by the back window.

49:58.720 --> 50:00.120
There was no other way out.

50:00.160 --> 50:02.760
It had rained earlier, the sand was wet.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.000
There should have been footprints,

50:02.800 --> 50:05.000
but there weren't any.

50:05.040 --> 50:08.040
As I said, impossible.

50:08.080 --> 50:11.680
There was no trace of the thief or the gun.

50:11.720 --> 50:16.520
Perhaps the killer was someone at the school.

50:16.560 --> 50:20.960
His wife, who would now be half a million dollars richer.

50:21.000 --> 50:24.320
Or the supposed friend, caught with the murder weapon.

50:24.360 --> 50:27.600
Or the long

50:27.640 --> 50:29.640
HUMPHREY: Or the runaway thief?

50:29.680 --> 50:31.160
You see, we had motives.

50:31.200 --> 50:36.560
None of that helped with

50:31.200 --> 50:36.560
the central problem.

50:36.600 --> 50:38.800
Until I considered another riddle.

50:38.840 --> 50:42.200
And then, it all started to make sense.

50:42.240 --> 50:46.360
If the killer had no way out of the workshop,

50:46.400 --> 50:48.680
then they had to still be there!

50:48.720 --> 50:50.480
But we'd have seen him.

50:50.520 --> 50:52.000
Oh, but you did.

50:53.160 --> 50:54.800
Jake Peters killed himself.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.480
Why would he do that?

50:58.520 --> 51:01.080
He'd been diagnosed with a terminal illness.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.840
That's why he said he couldn't be your father.

51:03.880 --> 51:07.000
Jake lived his life on his own terms.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.360
He lived to surf, he loved the freedom

51:07.040 --> 51:09.360
it gives you.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.160
The degenerative nature of the illness was something

51:11.200 --> 51:12.600
a man like him would never be able to cope with.

51:12.640 --> 51:16.080
He would do anything to avoid that.

51:18.600 --> 51:20.200
He got Steve to find him a gun

51:21.920 --> 51:25.080
and then he just needed to pick his moment.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.800
And that day, the surf was perfect.

51:30.720 --> 51:32.560
It was a good day to die.

51:32.600 --> 51:36.920
<i>He spent his last hours</i> <i>with the woman he loved</i>

51:32.600 --> 51:36.920
<i>doing what he lived for.</i>

51:36.960 --> 51:38.800
<i>He then came back</i> <i>to his workshop.</i>

51:38.840 --> 51:40.520
<i>He locked the door.</i>

51:40.560 --> 51:41.960
<i>He staged a struggle.</i>

51:42.000 --> 51:44.360
<i>Stripped himself of his</i> <i>valuables and hid them away.</i>

51:47.320 --> 51:48.600
<i>And then the final act.</i>

51:55.560 --> 51:58.240
It doesn't make any sense. The gun would still be there.

51:58.280 --> 51:59.880
Well, it was.

51:59.920 --> 52:02.920
Until someone else made it disappear.

52:06.160 --> 52:09.880
You knew about it, didn't you? And as his oldest friend,

52:09.920 --> 52:11.440
you had to be first on the scene.

52:12.920 --> 52:15.640
<i>So you could get the gun</i> <i>out of sight.</i>

52:15.680 --> 52:19.240
<i>Later, you'd put it with</i> <i>the valuables into</i>

52:15.680 --> 52:19.240
<i>your medical bag</i>

52:19.280 --> 52:22.800
<i>and get them safely away</i> <i>when you accompanied</i>

52:19.280 --> 52:22.800
<i>your friend's body.</i>

52:22.840 --> 52:25.960
Probably for them to be found later, confirming

52:22.840 --> 52:25.960
the robber theory.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.800
But how did they get in my van?

52:28.840 --> 52:31.000
Because the rain made robbery-gone-wrong impossible

52:31.040 --> 52:33.520
and we started digging. We discovered infidelity,

52:33.560 --> 52:36.120
the insurance, you didn't know about that, did you?

52:36.160 --> 52:38.280
No, no, I thought not.

52:38.320 --> 52:41.360
That was all Jake. Done out of love,

52:41.400 --> 52:43.440
but, er, rather stupid.

52:43.480 --> 52:45.440
The locked door, the open window,

52:43.480 --> 52:45.440
the apparent theft,

52:45.480 --> 52:48.560
all that led to someone outside the school.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.960
But the insurance implicated Katie.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.040
You couldn't have that, could you?

52:55.840 --> 52:57.760
Everything was leading us to Katie.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.240
So you needed a foil,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.640
a scapegoat, a patsy.

53:03.680 --> 53:07.240
You must have known that Jake had got the gun from Steve.

53:03.680 --> 53:07.240
I mean, it was all too easy.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.920
You were laying the ground work

53:07.280 --> 53:08.920
when we came to see you.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.000
Steve

53:11.040 --> 53:13.840
But no, 'cause Jake said Steve was out of all that...

53:13.880 --> 53:16.480
In fact, you've been leading us by the nose

53:13.880 --> 53:16.480
from the start.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.960
Always one step ahead.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
Did Katie call you after our visit?

53:22.040 --> 53:24.040
She was panicked.

53:24.080 --> 53:28.200
You know, she was convinced that you thought

53:24.080 --> 53:28.200
she'd killed Jake.

53:28.240 --> 53:31.280
Um, everything she told you was the truth,

53:31.320 --> 53:33.560
but it just kept on looking more and more like a lie.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.520
So, you had to act.

53:35.560 --> 53:38.160
<i>You planted the evidence.</i>

53:38.200 --> 53:40.240
<i>No doubt</i> <i>planning to tip us off.</i>

53:42.160 --> 53:44.080
Why would you do that?

53:44.120 --> 53:46.360
HUMPHREY: Only one thing makes sense to me.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.320
Makes sense of all your actions.

53:48.360 --> 53:52.120
Staying away from the wedding and not marrying yourself.

53:52.160 --> 53:54.480
Protecting Katie while seeming not to like her.

53:54.520 --> 53:56.280
The awkwardness...

53:56.320 --> 53:57.800
Proximity can be tough,

53:59.160 --> 54:00.280
torture, even.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.160
Being so close to the woman you love

54:04.200 --> 54:06.320
and not being able to tell her.

54:09.360 --> 54:11.080
You do love Katie, don't you?

54:16.880 --> 54:18.440
So, it was suicide, then?

54:18.480 --> 54:21.640
Ah, no, it was in fact murder.

54:21.680 --> 54:23.840
But you just said he killed himself.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.680
Yes, he did, he did. Um, er...

54:25.720 --> 54:29.760
It was murder made to look like suicide masquerading

54:25.720 --> 54:29.760
as murder.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.600
Yes.

54:32.640 --> 54:35.120
You couldn't let him go back out on the circuit,

54:32.640 --> 54:35.120
could you?

54:35.160 --> 54:36.560
He was going to take the woman you love away.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.840
He even talked about going back on the circuit.

54:38.880 --> 54:41.360
He came in for his medical and you saw your chance.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.680
Jake trusted you. Why wouldn't he?

54:45.720 --> 54:47.160
You were a doctor, you'd taken an oath.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.200
You were best friends, since childhood.

54:50.240 --> 54:52.080
You knew him better than anyone.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.840
You knew what he wouldn't be able to bear,

54:52.120 --> 54:54.840
the slow degeneration,

54:54.880 --> 54:58.640
the weakness, the incapacity in someone so vital.

55:00.600 --> 55:03.240
Robbery

55:06.040 --> 55:09.880
His suicide would lead to too many awkward questions.

55:09.920 --> 55:12.720
No doubt you told Jake that it would save Katie pain.

55:15.560 --> 55:19.200
And he saw a chance to look after the

55:15.560 --> 55:19.200
woman he loved

55:19.240 --> 55:22.040
to the tune of half a million dollars.

55:22.080 --> 55:25.520
Our pathologist found no trace of any

55:22.080 --> 55:25.520
degenerative condition.

55:26.640 --> 55:30.000
And we tested the pills to treat his illness

55:30.040 --> 55:32.440
and they were anti-psychotics.

55:32.480 --> 55:36.320
You needed something to induce symptoms

55:32.480 --> 55:36.320
and complete the illusion.

55:36.360 --> 55:37.880
How could you do it?

55:40.440 --> 55:42.640
You might not have pulled the trigger,

55:40.440 --> 55:42.640
but it's still murder.

55:44.400 --> 55:45.880
Take him away.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.440
Katie... Katie...

55:49.480 --> 55:51.280
How could you do it?

56:21.840 --> 56:24.160
He wants to stay out a bit longer.

56:24.200 --> 56:26.320
-Thinks he's getting the hang of it.

56:26.360 --> 56:28.680
-He's certainly enthusiastic. -Yes!

56:28.720 --> 56:32.400
-Well, he's definitely got a style of his own.

56:28.720 --> 56:32.400
-CAMILLE: Ah, yeah!

56:32.440 --> 56:34.000
Eh, look at that!

56:34.040 --> 56:35.920
-Well, I never!

56:41.800 --> 56:43.440
-Cheers! -Cheers!

56:45.600 --> 56:46.680
DWAYNE: Hey, hold on!

56:50.120 --> 56:51.480
He's not waving now, though!

56:51.520 --> 56:52.760
-No. -No.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.200
Oh!

57:00.480 --> 57:03.560
Well, it's not bad for a start.

57:03.600 --> 57:05.200
You think so?

57:05.240 --> 57:06.360
You didn't die.

57:06.400 --> 57:07.680
No, I didn't, did I?

57:08.240 --> 57:09.800
Excellent!

57:09.840 --> 57:11.360
It's all in the roll, you see.

57:11.400 --> 57:13.320
When nature makes a rag doll of you,

57:13.360 --> 57:14.920
then you must be the rag doll.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.040
Okay.

57:18.880 --> 57:20.880
I worry about you sometimes.

57:21.760 --> 57:22.880
Do you?

57:23.840 --> 57:26.280
Sure. You're fearless.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.800
You see something, you go for it.

57:28.600 --> 57:30.000
No matter what the risk.

57:32.040 --> 57:33.920
It's inspiring, I suppose.

57:34.280 --> 57:35.360
Is it?

57:36.000 --> 57:37.640
Sure.

57:37.680 --> 57:40.640
Being around you, it makes me smile.

57:42.760 --> 57:45.360
-Yes, why not.

57:51.120 --> 57:52.360
Be brave.

58:03.960 --> 58:05.160
Be brave.

58:09.320 --> 58:12.760
Welcome to the Saint Marie Heritage Society's tribute.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.960
Humphrey, I think I'm being followed.

58:16.840 --> 58:20.320
One of them managed to get some poison into the stew.

58:20.360 --> 58:22.880
DWAYNE: <i> I'll show you</i> <i>how the island really</i>

58:20.360 --> 58:22.880
<i>marks the anniversary.</i>

58:22.920 --> 58:24.800
Look at the Chief! -Whoo!

58:25.480 --> 58:27.920
FLORENCE: Stop!

58:27.960 --> 58:30.360
In my head, I've talked this through a million times

58:30.400 --> 58:31.800
and it's never come out right...

58:31.840 --> 58:33.120
-Oh! -Ah!
