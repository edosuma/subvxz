WEBVTT

00:13.722 --> 00:15.724
If he sees me, he's gonna run.

00:15.724 --> 00:18.893
- I can't just pull up on him.
- You every day with this shit.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.604
What else am I gonna do in here?
Get ripped? That's stupid.

00:21.604 --> 00:25.442
Oh, just chill. You got seven years
to plan your cousin's death.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.819
Chill? This stupid fuck.
All he had to do was vouch for me.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.155
He wouldn't have done a day.
He would've got fined.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.116
Here, let's talk about something else.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.492
What's your favorite season?

00:34.492 --> 00:36.119
I like summer. Now you go.

00:36.119 --> 00:39.039
I gotta get the fuck out of here, man!
The Filipinos are gonna kill me.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.665
- Oh, shit.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.504
- We're gonna open on cell four.

00:46.504 --> 00:47.672
Isaac.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.008
You're free to go.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.050
For real? Why?

00:51.551 --> 00:52.510
Phone call came in.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.096
Some lady said it was your cousin driving,
not you.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.182
He's gonna kill his cousin.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.100
He's got Nutter Butters behind his back.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.103
- All right, give me the Nutters.
- Whoo!

01:12.113 --> 01:13.948
Got it. Good to know.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.286
So do you have any questions?

01:18.286 --> 01:19.245
Or...

01:19.245 --> 01:21.498
You made some stupid decisions.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.750
You covered your ass to secure the deal.

01:23.750 --> 01:24.667
Pretty clear.

01:24.667 --> 01:28.838
Yeah, again, Jordan, I'm really sorry
that I hid all of that from you,

01:28.838 --> 01:30.840
but I've come clean to everyone:

01:30.840 --> 01:33.927
the police, Naomi, George.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.471
Let's not belabor this, please.

01:37.472 --> 01:38.890
What do you need, Amy?

01:38.890 --> 01:43.186
Well, you see,
George didn't mean to sell the Tamago.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.064
It's a pretty good chair.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.026
I'm willing to pay whatever you want.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.278
Seriously?

01:53.238 --> 01:55.073
Do I look like I need money?

01:55.615 --> 01:57.742
You wanted honey on the side, right?

01:57.742 --> 01:59.494
That's how I always take it.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.830
- Thanks, Naomi.
- Mm-hm.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.874
- Do you want anything to eat or...?
- We're good.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.296
Could you give us some space, please?

02:11.005 --> 02:12.465
All right, yeah, yeah.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.510
- I have emails to do. I'll see you later.
- Thanks.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.889
She's so attentive.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.184
Is that a cultural thing or...?

02:23.184 --> 02:25.937
No, Jordan, it's not a cultural thing.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.565
- Hm.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.448
Um, sorry, just-- Just one second.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.366
Sure.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.123
<i>Amy, are you there?</i>

02:45.123 --> 02:47.000
- Is everything okay?
<i>- He took June!</i>

02:47.000 --> 02:48.793
<i>Danny took her! I can't find her!</i>

02:48.793 --> 02:51.045
- Wait, what?
<i>- He came in and knocked me out.</i>

02:51.045 --> 02:52.839
<i>When I woke up, she was gone.</i>

02:52.839 --> 02:55.341
<i>That piece of shit took her in his truck!</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:57.427
- Oh, my God.
<i>- The police are here.</i>

02:57.427 --> 02:59.596
<i>You've gotta talk to them.
We have to find her.</i>

03:04.893 --> 03:07.520
Yo, one of my shitcoins is mooning, man.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.522
Thank God you took my passwords.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.691
Okay, come on, Junie.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.526
Just gonna sit right here.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.404
And wait right here with your puppy, okay?

03:16.404 --> 03:19.115
I don't have time to explain.
I gotta pack.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.453
Yo, what the fuck?

03:23.453 --> 03:24.621
Did you kidnap her kid?

03:24.621 --> 03:26.039
It was an accident.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.041
She jumped in the truck, I don't know.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.751
Why didn't you leave her?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.544
There was police. I couldn't stop.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.837
So drop her off somewhere.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.423
What if something bad happens to her?
Then that's on me.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.718
- So you brought her here?
- I don't know. I kept driving, I'm here.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.180
Just shut up and call Amy, tell her
her kid's okay, she can pick her up.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.973
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.935
I'm gonna...
drive down to Mexico or something.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.646
No. We can explain everything to the cops.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.272
I knocked out her husband.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.315
I knocked him out.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.650
They'll get me for assault.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.193
Why were you even there?

03:55.193 --> 03:58.279
You got questions?
I was cleaning up your mess.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.490
Zane, the video's done.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.741
Yo, who's Zane?

04:01.741 --> 04:03.952
- Dude, I--

04:03.952 --> 04:06.371
Yo, it's Michael and Bobby! Open up!

04:11.292 --> 04:13.294
Yo, what's taking so long?

04:13.294 --> 04:15.004
Just a second. God.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.131
- Is she good?
I think so.

04:17.131 --> 04:18.466
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, shit!

04:18.466 --> 04:20.301
Thought you could get a W off of me?

04:20.301 --> 04:22.971
- Piece of shit! Get over on me?
Get the fuck out of here!

04:23.846 --> 04:27.892
I swear to God, if the fucking cash
isn't in those rice cookers--

04:27.892 --> 04:29.560
You spent it! You spent it, huh?

04:29.560 --> 04:31.062
Isaac, I can explain!

04:31.062 --> 04:33.982
I need that fucking money today!
I need it today!

04:33.982 --> 04:36.234
The Filipinos are gonna castrate me!

04:36.234 --> 04:38.194
What the fuck is he talking about, Danny?

04:38.194 --> 04:40.655
Stop. No fighting.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.408
Whose fucking kid is that?

04:45.410 --> 04:46.619
It's Paul's new girl's--

04:46.619 --> 04:47.787
It's her kid.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.415
I wasn't gone that long.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.667
It's a different dude from before.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.003
It's been an adjustment for sure.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.890
Yo, how do I turn Amber Alerts off?

05:10.685 --> 05:11.894
Chill, he'll get it.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.189
Oh, shit.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.191
<i>Amy, I'm Detective Doran.</i>

05:17.191 --> 05:19.777
<i>You called this in, but just so I'm clear,</i>

05:19.777 --> 05:23.865
<i>Daniel Cho, he's the man
you got into a road rage with, not Isaac.</i>

05:23.865 --> 05:25.616
<i>- Yes?</i>
<i>Tell them about the brother.</i>

05:25.616 --> 05:27.452
<i>- Maybe he's with him.</i>
<i>George, please.</i>

05:27.452 --> 05:28.494
<i>Let's remain calm.</i>

05:28.494 --> 05:31.122
Yeah, he's got this younger brother, Paul.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.207
- He's about six feet and--
<i>Hmm, 5'11".</i>

05:33.207 --> 05:34.751
<i>More like 5'11".</i>

05:34.751 --> 05:37.337
<i>George, please.</i>
- Sorry, give me one sec.

05:41.632 --> 05:42.675
Hello.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.968
<i>Amy Lau?</i>

05:44.927 --> 05:46.220
Who is this?

05:46.220 --> 05:48.681
<i>Your daughter's safe.
She's ready to be picked up.</i>

05:48.681 --> 05:49.766
Oh, my God.

05:50.933 --> 05:51.851
Thank you.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.729
<i>$500,000 cash. No cops. No husband.</i>

05:55.521 --> 05:56.355
Who is this?

05:56.355 --> 05:59.067
- Is Danny there?
<i>- Five hundred thousand cash.</i>

05:59.067 --> 06:02.403
I don't even know
if I could withdraw that much. Please.

06:02.403 --> 06:06.574
I'm in the middle of nowhere
and the banks aren't even open today.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.367
<i>Shut the fuck up. I know you're rich.</i>

06:08.367 --> 06:10.995
<i>Come up with the money today.
Get the fucking cash today.</i>

06:10.995 --> 06:13.414
<i>Don't tell anyone.
I'll call you with the location.</i>

06:13.414 --> 06:15.792
No, no, no. Please. Do not hang up.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.836
I want to give you the money, okay?
I really do.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.171
<i>Don't fuck with me.</i>

06:20.171 --> 06:21.255
I'm not. I swear.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.550
<i>There are people more dangerous than me
who want this money right away.</i>

06:24.550 --> 06:26.427
I'm at a billionaire's house--

06:26.427 --> 06:28.596
<i>Good for you, bitch. Stop trying to stall.</i>

06:28.596 --> 06:30.056
<i>You triangulating my location?</i>

06:31.599 --> 06:33.810
Jordana Forster. You heard of her?

06:33.810 --> 06:34.977
<i>Yeah, she's hot.</i>

06:35.645 --> 06:37.939
Yeah. Well, she's got these artifacts,

06:37.939 --> 06:39.899
like honest-to-God crowns,

06:39.899 --> 06:42.735
they're worth hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

06:42.735 --> 06:46.072
You could come here
and clear north of a million, easy.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.657
<i>A million? Shit.</i>

06:49.826 --> 06:52.703
<i>- How do I know this isn't a trap?</i>
- Because you have my daughter!

06:52.703 --> 06:54.247
Why would I risk it?

06:54.247 --> 06:57.667
I don't even know
how I would withdraw like 500k.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.878
I would move money between accounts
and that could take days.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.213
<i>Hm...</i>

07:02.213 --> 07:04.215
Look, write down this address.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.593
22 Mountain View Trail.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.221
My car's parked right outside.

07:11.264 --> 07:15.518
Please just leave my daughter
in the car seat, okay?

07:16.060 --> 07:19.105
I'll make sure that nobody,
no one, calls the cops.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.315
You'll be in and out, okay?

07:23.609 --> 07:24.527
Hello?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.903
<i>I'm heading over now.</i>

07:25.903 --> 07:29.115
<i>I swear, if you tell anyone,
I'll kill your fucking daughter.</i>

07:29.115 --> 07:30.741
<i>-</i> [ June ] <i>Mister , where are we ?</i>
- Wait!

07:38.958 --> 07:42.003
- You pack the masks?
- Of course I packed the masks.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.504
The masks were my idea.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.798
There wouldn't be masks
if my mom didn't help us.

07:45.798 --> 07:46.924
Shut up.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.510
It's fucking weird
how much your mom loves Dick Cheney.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.097
You stole his money
for Mom and Dad's house?

07:54.265 --> 07:56.601
- Yeah.
- Are you okay, Zane?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.937
We're gonna go see your mommy now.
Don't you worry, okay?

07:59.937 --> 08:02.231
I'm not. This is fun!

08:04.609 --> 08:07.820
Dude, be careful, man!
She doesn't have a seat belt on.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.114
So cute seeing this side of you, Zane.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.407
Just let them go.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.742
You're mad at me. Not them.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.870
Paul, you really didn't know
big bro was letting family rot in jail,

08:15.870 --> 08:17.038
and robbing them blind?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.664
I would've done the same.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.626
Ooh, ouch. Cho Bros. So mean.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.670
- Yo, you missed the turn.
- Not with the gun, Bobby.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.797
You don't think I know where the turn is?

08:26.797 --> 08:30.134
Kid's the only leverage we have.
I'm not putting her in her car yet.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.344
Stupid fuck.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.139
Thank you, guys.
Please, just keep me posted.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.184
You got it. We'll let you know
if we hear anything.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.235
Hey, are you okay?

08:47.235 --> 08:49.028
Are the police still there?

08:49.028 --> 08:50.613
They just left. Let me grab them.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.073
<i>No, no, George, don't.</i>

08:52.073 --> 08:54.784
I need you to come over to Jordan's now.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.994
What is going on, Amy?

08:56.994 --> 08:58.538
<i>Junie is safe.</i>

08:58.538 --> 08:59.914
Oh, thank God.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.501
Someone called and it wasn't Danny.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.254
They want 500k in cash today.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.713
Let me get the police.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.758
No, George,
they explicitly said no police.

09:10.758 --> 09:11.759
<i>Of course they did.</i>

09:11.759 --> 09:13.386
George, you're not listening.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.513
<i>They said they'd kill her.</i>

09:16.305 --> 09:17.807
Oh, my God.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.976
Please, just come to Jordan's.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.019
They're gonna put Junie in my car

09:22.562 --> 09:24.605
and I need you to come get her.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.649
You can't tell anybody, okay?

09:27.316 --> 09:28.859
<i>They told me not to tell you.</i>

09:28.859 --> 09:32.113
I know I've used up
any trust left between us,

09:32.113 --> 09:33.823
but I'm taking a leap of faith here

09:33.823 --> 09:38.369
that we can get on the same page for June.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.040
Yeah. Okay.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.584
<i>You did the right thing.</i>

09:44.584 --> 09:47.878
<i>Let's do exactly what they say
and get her back safely.</i>

09:48.963 --> 09:49.839
Thank you.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.632
I love you.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.012
I love you too.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.479
And this is my little collection.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.981
Let me show you my favorite.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.524
This one.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.948
This is from the Chimú kingdom.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.409
Wow!

10:18.409 --> 10:19.785
I used to have the earrings,

10:19.785 --> 10:23.205
but I had to return them
to the Peruvian government, whatever.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.666
Yeah, I used to collect Beanie Babies.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.085
I don't know what that is.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.255
Oh, and this one.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.173
This--

10:35.259 --> 10:37.970
Hey, are you sure you want the whole tour?

10:37.970 --> 10:40.473
- You seem distracted.
- Sorry. I...

10:42.725 --> 10:44.560
I'm just thinking about George.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.020
Yeah.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.357
I get it.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.444
Really, I do. Divorce is tough.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.072
But...

10:58.199 --> 10:59.742
Everything fades, Amy.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.954
People, things, experiences.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.041
You just gotta keep...

11:07.750 --> 11:10.211
grabbing what you can. Right?

11:11.212 --> 11:13.506
That's what makes life so wonderful.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.925
There's always something.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.139
Wow, Jordan, you are so insightful.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.101
Can I try one on?

11:25.684 --> 11:27.603
Yes. Of course.

11:27.603 --> 11:28.729
Which one?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.898
Maybe the Marge Simpson.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.400
Great.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.320
It's one of my favorites.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.618
- Wow...
It's getting late.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.038
The roads get dark here, Amy.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.623
You might want to start driving.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.375
Right, yeah.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.793
Thanks, Naomi.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.047
Oof, the traffic is probably
pretty bad, though...

11:55.047 --> 11:56.173
Exactly, exactly.

11:56.173 --> 11:59.218
So stay. Spend the night if you want.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.392
You're really getting
the full tour today, Amy.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.353
This is a lovely room as well.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.729
It's amazing.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.703
Weird. There's no one there--

12:25.703 --> 12:27.329
Hands up!
Move! Move!

12:27.329 --> 12:29.081
In the other room! Let's go!

12:29.081 --> 12:31.333
In the other room! Let's go! Now!

12:31.333 --> 12:32.960
Move over there! Go!

12:32.960 --> 12:34.753
- Move!
- Oh, my God!

12:34.753 --> 12:38.048
Let's all just stay calm
and do exactly what they say.

12:38.048 --> 12:41.051
Give me your fucking phones.
- Where's my fucking phone?

12:41.051 --> 12:43.554
Everything over 10k
in this house goes in these bags.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.930
That's everything in this house.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.265
We'll need more bags.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.726
Hey, did my brother put you up to this?

12:48.726 --> 12:50.311
- Jordan.
What?

12:50.311 --> 12:53.522
If he is that upset about Naomi,
he can have her back.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.691
- Your fucking stores give me migraines!

12:55.691 --> 12:57.109
I can get more bags.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.028
They're Goyard.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.947
I don't know what that is, sounds cool.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.825
Okay. Yeah. We want those bags. Move!

13:04.825 --> 13:05.993
Move!

13:05.993 --> 13:07.828
Panic room, southwest corner.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.164
- Jordan, don't.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.889
She's been good this whole time.

13:26.889 --> 13:30.226
Man, guilt-tripping me.
I bet I'd be a good dad.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.894

- Yeah.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.354
- But this the last time.
- Okay.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.731
Let's close your eyes one more time.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.437
Yeah, Bobby's just very tired.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.232
Hey, why don't we go hide
before he wakes up?

14:18.857 --> 14:22.069

14:22.069 --> 14:23.404
All right.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.697
Give me the gun.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.451
Good boy.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.203
Hey, you're not mad at me?

14:33.163 --> 14:34.915
You looked past my mistakes.

14:36.834 --> 14:37.918
Come on, let's go.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.050
That should do it.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.678
Thanks for the cooperation, ladies.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.097
See, that wasn't so bad.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.932
- Pleasure doing business.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.934
- Wait, are those sirens?
What the fuck?

14:53.934 --> 14:55.352
Fuck. Fuck!

14:55.352 --> 14:58.272
- You promised you wouldn't call the cops!
- I didn't, I swear.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.690
- You called them?
I didn't!

14:59.690 --> 15:02.151
- Where's my daughter?
- She knows them.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.445
You tell your husband?
What's going on?

15:04.445 --> 15:07.031
- Is my daughter in my car?
- This is who you wanna leave me for?

15:07.031 --> 15:08.574
Tell Bobby to bring the car.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.159
I'm calling. He won't answer.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.454
Who called the fucking cops?
Who called the cops?

15:13.454 --> 15:15.331
Fucking bitch. Fuck.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.832
What are we gonna do?

15:16.832 --> 15:20.252
Yo, that Hummer's an older model,
we could hot wire it.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.962
All right.

15:21.962 --> 15:22.880
Okay.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.092
All right, Junie.
I'm gonna lock the doors,

15:27.092 --> 15:30.095
and I promise your mom's
gonna be here soon, okay?

15:30.095 --> 15:33.182
Maybe you could come over,
and we could sing more songs.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.351
Yeah, maybe.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.352
I'd like that.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.479
You'll be good by yourself?

15:38.479 --> 15:40.731
I'm not by myself, silly.

15:40.731 --> 15:41.899
I have Luca.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.693
- Yo. We gotta go.
- Okay.

15:44.693 --> 15:47.071
All right. Hey, watch your foot, okay?

15:48.739 --> 15:49.573
Shit.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.370
Yo, let's hurry.
We can take the other road out.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.913
Let's check the Hummer.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.583
God, I hope rich people are stupid.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.004
Got thems.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.049
Want me to get in there and hot wire?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.218
If we're really lucky...

16:11.804 --> 16:13.263
- What?
- Dude.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.350
Where the fuck is Bobby? Hm?

16:17.226 --> 16:20.646
Okay, fuck, I gotta think.
There's gotta be a way out of this.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.857
- Have you ever heard of zugzwang?
- What the fuck you going off about?

16:23.857 --> 16:27.277
It's the point in chess
where you have to make a move,

16:27.277 --> 16:30.155
but every move is a loss.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.825
Why do you hang out with her?
You know you're Asian, right?

16:32.825 --> 16:33.993
Look what I found.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.497
Danny, is June okay?
- She's fine.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.540
Where's the van?

16:39.540 --> 16:42.251
Where we left it. Bobby's not picking up!

16:44.545 --> 16:46.797
If I don't leave here
with the stash, I'm dead!

16:46.797 --> 16:49.800
- So you might as well be dead too.
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.303
Why don't I call my husband? Okay?
He can talk to the cops.

16:54.096 --> 16:59.101
I'm gonna tell him that Danny and Paul
are holding us hostage, all of us.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.060
Okay?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.980
Hey, it's a good idea.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.567
Hey, Zugzug.
Those doors lock from this side?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.986
- I have no fucking idea.
- Yeah, they do.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.197
Then let's go. Move!
Go, go. Go, motherfucker.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.158
Fucking go! Move!
Okay, go.

17:14.783 --> 17:17.578
These cops better not test me.
I'm not going back to jail.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.621
Isaac.

17:19.621 --> 17:22.166
- What are you doing?
- This is your fault.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.542
Naomi!
- Oh, shit.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.794
- South door's closed!
Get them!

17:25.794 --> 17:26.712
Shit.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.590
I'm right behind you!

17:33.677 --> 17:34.511
Come here!

17:40.809 --> 17:42.144
Where you going?

17:42.144 --> 17:43.479
I'll break your legs!

17:43.479 --> 17:46.607
Naomi! Naomi, not yet!

17:47.566 --> 17:49.151
Come here!
- Naomi!

17:56.575 --> 17:57.826
<i>Obstruction.</i>

17:57.826 --> 17:59.745
Oh, shit.
<i>- Obstruction.</i>

18:01.371 --> 18:02.581
<i>Obstruction.</i>

18:07.961 --> 18:09.713
<i>Room secured.</i>

18:18.388 --> 18:19.348
The fuck?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.559
Isaac, what the fuck is happening?

18:24.561 --> 18:26.271
What kind of house is this?

18:26.271 --> 18:27.231
Fuck!

18:29.858 --> 18:31.318
Here, call your husband.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.071
- Call him now! Hurry!

18:34.071 --> 18:35.239
George!
<i>Amy!</i>

18:35.239 --> 18:36.824
June's in my car outside.

18:36.824 --> 18:37.908
<i>- In the car?</i>
Yes.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.620
In my car outside, and Danny and Paul
are holding us hostage.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.997
George.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.999
George? Hello?

18:48.001 --> 18:51.505
Officers are on scene.
Come out with your hands up.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.006
Fuck. Call 911.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.008
Get up! Call 911!

18:55.008 --> 18:57.177
- Get the fuck up! Call 911!
Isaac, please.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.638
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

18:59.638 --> 19:01.932
I'm at 22 Mountain View Trail.

19:01.932 --> 19:05.394
I have a woman hostage
and I'll fucking kill her!

19:05.394 --> 19:06.645
I'll shoot her!

19:06.645 --> 19:09.648
Did you hear that? I'm fucking serious!

19:13.902 --> 19:15.028
What the fuck?

19:15.028 --> 19:16.655
We gotta get out of here.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.743
Yo, yo, I think if you give me a boost,
I can get up there.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.163
What? No, that's too high.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.081
We don't have any other options. Hurry.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.207
I can do this.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.294
Kneel down and give me a boost.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.545
Right here.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.172
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.923
- I'm gonna climb up.
- All right.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.258
Get-- Yeah.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.509
Put your... leg up.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.679
- Okay. Okay, push it up.
- All right, go up. Yup.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.597
Okay.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.432
Oh, shit!

19:44.516 --> 19:45.434
Holy shit!

19:45.434 --> 19:47.686
Shit!
- I told you.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.896
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.480
- Okay.
- Your turn.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.816
- Fuck.
- That's all right.

19:54.651 --> 19:55.986
Almost there.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.906
- Come on.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.454
Fuck.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.248
You stupid bitch! You think I give a fuck?

20:08.248 --> 20:10.709
I'll kill her. Back the fuck up, now!

20:10.709 --> 20:13.212
- Isaac. Isaac.
<i>-</i> [ dispatcher ] <i>I need you to calm down.</i>

20:13.212 --> 20:15.130
- You don't need to do this.
- Shut up!

20:15.130 --> 20:18.258
- You don't know me!
- You don't seem like a bad guy.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.844
You don't. I'm sure this is Danny's fault.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.847
- I'm sure it is.
<i>- Sir, talk to me or the police will enter.</i>

20:23.847 --> 20:25.891
- Just let me go. Please.
<i>- Hello?</i>

20:25.891 --> 20:30.229
Please. You've seen my daughter.
You've seen my husband.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.440
And I know you don't want
to rip me away from them.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.778
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.196
If you let me go now,

20:39.988 --> 20:42.824
there's a chance you'll get out in,
what, like...

20:43.700 --> 20:45.118
five years? Maybe?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.496
And you can start over.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.580
You can.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.707
Isaac. Isaac!

20:50.707 --> 20:52.251
They're coming in.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.752
Get down on the ground.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.629
Go.
Move, move, move!

20:55.629 --> 20:57.005
Fuck!

20:59.424 --> 21:01.218
Take that, you fucking pigs!

21:15.274 --> 21:16.984
- Come on.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.280
Paul.

21:21.947 --> 21:22.823
Just go.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.367
- I'm not leaving you. Come on.
- You gotta go.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.536
I'm not fucking leaving. Come on!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.338
I burned down the house.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.132
What?

21:41.508 --> 21:42.926
Mom and Dad's.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.720
I put in the wrong wires.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.930
Yo, what are you talking about?
Just come on.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.056
No, I'm serious.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.058
It's all my fault.

21:50.892 --> 21:51.977
It's my fault too.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.396
- Can you jump? We gotta go.
- No, no, no.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.690
I've been holding you down
your whole life.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.401
I can't. We can't.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.361
Danny, come on.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.408
Yo, I threw away
your college applications.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.662
What?

22:10.662 --> 22:13.999
At the motel, I saw them in the lobby
and I threw them in the trash.

22:16.668 --> 22:17.711
I'm sorry.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.843
I just wanted us to be the same.

22:29.806 --> 22:30.849
You gotta go.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.936
You gotta get away from me, man.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.565
You gotta get away from me.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.668
Hey! You! Freeze!

22:58.668 --> 22:59.961
Shit.

23:01.838 --> 23:02.672
Paul?

23:05.884 --> 23:06.760
Paul!

23:09.054 --> 23:10.055
Paul!

23:13.558 --> 23:14.893
Paul!

24:11.992 --> 24:14.244
<i>Hi, it's George. Leave a message.</i>

24:14.244 --> 24:16.204
Hey, sir! Where's my family?

24:16.204 --> 24:17.539
Is my daughter okay?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.292
Your daughter's safe, miss.
We retrieved her unharmed.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.710
Well, can I see her?

24:21.710 --> 24:23.712
- Where's George?
They didn't tell you?

24:23.712 --> 24:26.590
- I'm sorry. They left earlier.
- What?

24:27.382 --> 24:29.718
Your husband
wanted to take your daughter home.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.721
Miss, if you just let the medic
check your vitals.
