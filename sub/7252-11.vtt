05:48.389 --> 05:50.225
STARING AT ME?

05:50.267 --> 05:51.935
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT

05:50.267 --> 05:51.935
IF I TOLD YOU.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.980
THE REVEREND IS BLUSHING.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.980
WHY IS HE BLUSHING?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.523
I'D WALK OUT OF HERE

05:55.022 --> 05:56.523
IF I WAS YOU,

05:56.564 --> 05:58.984
AND TRY NOT TO WALK

05:56.564 --> 05:58.984
TOO SEXY.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.194
OKAY, YOU'LL EXPLAIN

05:59.026 --> 06:00.194
THAT TO ME LATER?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.736
I'D ENJOY THAT.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.030
HI, GUYS.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.156
PRETTY LADY.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.449
TOO THIN.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.827
WELL, IT ISN'T

06:06.491 --> 06:08.827
ABOUT YOUR TASTE, ANDREW.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.829
I'M GOING FOR

06:08.869 --> 06:10.829
HISTORICAL ACCURACY, SY.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.413
WOMEN WERE HEAVIER

06:10.871 --> 06:12.413
BACK THEN.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.581
HOW ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.250
YOU WANT

06:13.623 --> 06:15.250
A SOCK IN THE NOSE?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.711
NO, NO, JEAN, THAT WORKS

06:15.292 --> 06:17.711
PERFECTLY WITH MY SCHEDULE.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.006
AND IT'S BEEN FOREVER

06:17.752 --> 06:21.006
SINCE WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.343
OH, I'D LOVE THAT. MIRABELLE IS

06:21.048 --> 06:24.343
STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITE --

06:24.383 --> 06:25.344
OH!

06:25.384 --> 06:27.929
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

06:27.971 --> 06:32.017
NO, UH -- JEAN,

06:27.971 --> 06:32.017
HANG ON A SECOND, WILL YOU?

06:32.059 --> 06:34.561
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

06:34.602 --> 06:35.812
HELLO?

06:35.854 --> 06:36.855
There's a dog

06:35.854 --> 06:36.855
on the patio!

06:36.897 --> 06:37.856
WHAT? EMILY?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.149
OF COURSE IT'S EMILY.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.441
I'm sorry.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.441
You sound agitated.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.442
DID YOU GET A DOG?

06:41.484 --> 06:42.819
CERTAINLY NOT.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.403
Well, there's a dog

06:42.861 --> 06:44.403
on the patio.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.530
WHERE ARE<i> YOU?</i>

06:45.572 --> 06:46.573
INSIDE.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.573
RICHARD, DO SOMETHING.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.200
I CAN'T SEE IT FROM HERE.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.118
HE'S HERE NONETHELESS,

06:48.242 --> 06:50.118
AND HE'S LOOKING AT ME.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.328
RICHARD, THE DOG

06:50.160 --> 06:51.328
IS LOOKING AT ME.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.954
HOLD ON.

06:52.996 --> 06:56.250
I'M HOLDING, BUT WHAT ARE

06:52.996 --> 06:56.250
WE GOING TO -- RICHARD?

06:57.625 --> 06:59.669
SHOO! SHOO!

06:59.711 --> 07:01.504
NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.257
I WASN'T DOUBTING YOU, EMILY.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.257
I JUST COULDN'T SEE IT.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.008
WHAT IS THAT?

07:05.050 --> 07:07.426
YOU MADE IT SOUND LIKE IT WAS A

07:05.050 --> 07:07.426
RABID BEAST, SO I CAME PREPARED.

07:07.468 --> 07:08.678
DON'T GET TOO CLOSE.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.097
I DON'T SEE ANY FROTH

07:08.720 --> 07:10.097
ON ITS MOUTH.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.639
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.809
I SEE A COLLAR BUT NO TAG.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.809
THAT ISN'T VERY SMART.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.311
You're getting too close.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.021
WELL, WHAT SHOULD I DO?

07:16.353 --> 07:18.021
IT'S FREEZING OUT HERE.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.439
WE CAN'T LET IT

07:18.063 --> 07:19.439
ROAM AROUND.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.441
WELL, IT CAN'T COME

07:19.480 --> 07:21.441
INTO THE HOUSE.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.777
WHY SOMEONE WOULD FAIL

07:21.482 --> 07:23.777
TO PUT A TAG ON A DOG...

07:23.818 --> 07:26.905
TAKE IT TO THE POOL HOUSE.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.905
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IT.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.116
WE HAVE A POOL HOUSE

07:26.947 --> 07:29.116
FOR STRAY DOGS?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.034
LOVE THE INNUENDO, EMILY.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.660
FINE. I WILL TAKE HIM

07:31.076 --> 07:32.660
INTO THE POOL HOUSE.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.121
THANK YOU, RICHARD.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.123
I CAME OUT, AND HE WAS

07:34.162 --> 07:36.123
JUST SITTING THERE.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.292
IT'S A "HE"?

07:36.164 --> 07:38.292
I don't know.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.043
I CAN'T GET A VISUAL

07:38.333 --> 07:40.043
FROM THIS ANGLE.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.211
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

07:41.253 --> 07:44.339
DOG, I WANT YOU

07:41.253 --> 07:44.339
TO COME WITH ME.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.632
COME ALONG, DOG.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.134
HE'S FOLLOWING YOU.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.468
SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.719
GOOD JOB, RICHARD!

07:51.638 --> 07:54.391
HEY. YOU KNOW WHO JUST NIPPED

07:51.638 --> 07:54.391
AT MY NOSE? JACK FROST.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.351
YOU KNOW WHO JUST NIPPED

07:54.433 --> 07:56.351
AT MY EAR? JACK I-DON'T-CARE.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.145
LOOK OUTSIDE, MICHEL.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.021
IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN

07:58.186 --> 08:00.021
THE INN BLANKETED BY SNOW.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.356
IT'S LIKE A POSTCARD.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.233
I KNOW.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.233
I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS EXCITED

08:03.275 --> 08:06.278
SINCE MADONNA JUST DROPPED BY

08:03.275 --> 08:06.278
"TOTAL REQUEST LIVE."

08:06.320 --> 08:08.155
THE FLOOR'S A LITTLE WET.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.155
ARE WE GETTING THE MATS OUT?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.864
WE ARE WITHOUT MATS.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.864
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.491
WE ORDERED THEM EIGHT MONTHS

08:09.906 --> 08:11.491
AGO. WE GOT CONFIRMATION.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.368
THAT THEY WERE BACK-ORDERED

08:11.532 --> 08:13.368
AND DUE WITHIN 2 WEEKS.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.787
2 WEEKS TURNED INTO 8 MONTHS,

08:13.410 --> 08:15.787
AND ALL WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT

08:15.829 --> 08:17.914
IS OUR SPECIAL YELLOW

08:15.829 --> 08:17.914
BACK-ORDER RECEIPT.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.624
IT'S SUCH CHEAP PAPER

08:17.956 --> 08:19.624
THEY USE AT THE MAT PLACE,

08:19.666 --> 08:20.667
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

08:19.666 --> 08:20.667
A CLUE.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.043
WHAT ELSE CAN WE PUT DOWN?

08:22.085 --> 08:23.420
PLENTY. I SAW TWO MOVIES

08:22.085 --> 08:23.420
OVER THE WEEKEND.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.088
THEY WERE BOTH AWFUL.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.215
I MEANT PUT DOWN ON THE FLOOR

08:25.130 --> 08:27.215
SO OUR GUESTS DON'T SLIP.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.883
WE HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.844
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

08:28.925 --> 08:30.844
THERE WILL BE LESS PEOPLE HERE

08:30.885 --> 08:31.970
WHO COULD POSSIBLE SLIP.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.430
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

08:32.012 --> 08:33.430
"LESS PEOPLE"?

08:33.472 --> 08:36.016
WE'VE HAD FOUR CANCELATIONS

08:33.472 --> 08:36.016
IN THE LAST HOUR.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.225
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.227
ALL DUE TO SNOW.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.229
SNOW?

08:39.269 --> 08:41.229
OUR BEAUTIFUL SNOW?

08:41.271 --> 08:43.148
PEOPLE SAY IT IS COLD

08:41.271 --> 08:43.148
AND THE STREETS ARE BAD.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.192
THE STREETS ARE FINE.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.192
THEY'RE PLOWING AWAY OUT THERE.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.027
A GRACEFUL, GORGEOUS PLOW

08:47.068 --> 08:49.446
IS PUSHING THE SNOWY WHITE OUT

08:47.068 --> 08:49.446
OF THE STREET RIGHT BEHIND ME.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.406
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.406
THEY WANTED NICE WEATHER.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.367
THIS IS NICE WEATHER. IT'S

08:51.448 --> 08:53.367
CLASSIC CONNECTICUT-INN WEATHER.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.909
IT'S ALL THE MORE REASON

08:53.408 --> 08:54.909
TO COME.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.454
I WOULD ADVISE THAT YOU CHANGE

08:54.951 --> 08:57.454
OUR CANCELATION POLICY.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.206
THESE PEOPLE CANCEL

08:57.496 --> 08:59.206
AND HAVE TO PAY NOTHING.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.290
I HATE CHARGING PEOPLE

08:59.247 --> 09:00.290
FOR CANCELING.

09:00.332 --> 09:01.749
IT'S TOO CORPORATE.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.126
WE'RE DOING THINGS

09:01.791 --> 09:03.126
DIFFERENTLY HERE.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.421
OH, YES. BANKRUPTCY

09:03.168 --> 09:06.421
WILL BE FUN AND DIFFERENT.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.756
BE SURE TO FILE FOR IT

09:06.463 --> 09:08.756
WHILE IT'S SNOWING, WON'T YOU?

09:08.798 --> 09:12.093
WE'LL GO TO BANKRUPTCY COURT

09:08.798 --> 09:12.093
IN A HORSE-DRAWN SLEIGH.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.136
TRY TO FIND MATS.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.929
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.639
HEY, SOOKIE.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.639
GOOD MORNING.

09:16.681 --> 09:19.393
HOW ARE YOU LOVING

09:16.681 --> 09:19.393
OUR WINTER WONDERLAND?

09:19.434 --> 09:20.477
MY CAR WOULDN'T START

09:19.434 --> 09:20.477
THIS MORNING.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.020
UGH. DRAG.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.730
AND WE'RE ALMOST COMPLETELY

09:22.062 --> 09:23.730
OUT OF COFFEE.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.357
SO MAKE SOME MORE.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.192
I MEAN<i> OUT</i> OUT.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.192
THERE'S NO MORE ON THE PREMISES.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.902
YOU'RE KIDDING.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.902
I WISH I WAS.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.112
BUT, THERE'S MOUNTAINS OF IT

09:28.943 --> 09:31.112
STACKED IN THE WALK-IN.

09:31.154 --> 09:34.241
HEROIN-SNIFFING DOGS GET EXCITED

09:31.154 --> 09:34.241
AND CONFUSED WHEN THEY GO IN

09:31.154 --> 09:34.241
THERE.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.825
WHY DO THEY GET

09:34.282 --> 09:35.825
ALL EXCITED AND CONFUSED?

09:35.867 --> 09:37.077
BECAUSE YOU SMUGGLE HEROIN

09:35.867 --> 09:37.077
IN COFFEE.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.495
NO, I DON'T.

09:38.537 --> 09:39.829
IT WAS IN "BEVERLY HILLS COP,"

09:38.537 --> 09:39.829
REMEMBER?

09:39.871 --> 09:41.331
THE HEROIN AND THE COFFEE?

09:41.373 --> 09:42.541
WHY ARE YOU TAKING EVERYTHING

09:41.373 --> 09:42.541
SO LITERALLY?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.209
MY CAR WOULDN'T START.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.752
SINCE WHEN DOES THAT MAKE YOU

09:44.251 --> 09:45.752
TAKE THINGS LITERALLY?

09:45.793 --> 09:46.920
WAIT, I'M SORRY,

09:46.961 --> 09:48.713
WHEN WERE THERE DOGS

09:46.961 --> 09:48.713
IN THE WALK-IN?

09:48.755 --> 09:51.799
I'M SAYING WE HAD A LOT OF

09:48.755 --> 09:51.799
COFFEE -- UNTIL NOW, APPARENTLY.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.800
BECAUSE WE'RE SWITCHING

09:51.841 --> 09:52.800
SUPPLIERS.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.428
I FOUND THAT NEW BLEND.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.970
REMEMBER? YOU TASTED IT,

09:54.469 --> 09:55.970
YOU SAID IT TASTED GREAT.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.264
I LIKED IT,

09:56.012 --> 09:57.264
I REMMEBER.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.639
SO, I'M LETTING

09:57.305 --> 09:58.639
THE OLD STUFF RUN OUT

09:58.681 --> 09:59.807
BECAUSE THE NEW STUFF'S

09:58.681 --> 09:59.807
COMING IN.

09:59.849 --> 10:00.850
BUT, THE NEW STUFF IS

09:59.849 --> 10:00.850
BACK-ORDERED,

10:00.892 --> 10:02.185
SO IT NEVER CAME IN.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.228
LET'S SEND OUT FOR MORE

10:02.227 --> 10:03.228
IMMEDIATELY.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.229
NOT POSSIBLE.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.522
WHY?

10:05.564 --> 10:07.148
REMEMBER THOSE

10:05.564 --> 10:07.148
WONDERFUL SNOWPLOWS

10:07.190 --> 10:09.692
YOU WERE WRITING A SONNET TO

10:07.190 --> 10:09.692
NOT FIVE MINUTES AGO?

10:09.734 --> 10:13.029
WELL, ONE OF THEM DUMPED

10:09.734 --> 10:13.029
A 10-FOOT MOUNTAIN OF SNOW

10:13.071 --> 10:14.239
IN OUR DRIVEWAY.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.449
THERE IS NO GETTING IN

10:14.281 --> 10:15.449
OR OUT.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.075
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.619
IT'S NOT SO BAD

10:17.117 --> 10:19.619
'CAUSE WITH THE CANCELATIONS,

10:19.660 --> 10:21.788
NO ONE'S COMING TODAY

10:19.660 --> 10:21.788
ANYWAY.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.706
BUT WE HAVE TO GET OUT

10:21.829 --> 10:23.706
TO GO HOME, EVENTUALLY,

10:23.748 --> 10:26.334
AND TO GET COFFEE NOW,

10:23.748 --> 10:26.334
SO START THE GUYS DIGGING.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.087
I SHOULD GET THE<i> ONE</i> GUY

10:26.376 --> 10:29.087
WHO DID NOT CALL IN SICK

10:29.129 --> 10:31.131
BECAUSE OF THE SNOW AND COLD

10:29.129 --> 10:31.131
TO GET DIGGING?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.882
YES, GET HIM DIGGING.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.509
IT'S OKAY.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.509
IT'S ALL GOOD.

10:34.551 --> 10:38.054
SNOW WILL BE DUG,

10:34.551 --> 10:38.054
AND MATS WILL BE FOUND,

10:38.096 --> 10:40.599
COFFEE WILL BE BOUGHT --

10:38.096 --> 10:40.599
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

BUG YOU ANYMORE, OKAY?

16:06.800 --> 16:07.842
OKAY.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.469
I DIDN'T THINK IT THROUGH,

16:09.510 --> 16:11.888
AND I FEEL PRETTY DUMB

16:09.510 --> 16:11.888

16:19.813 --> 16:22.440
TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

16:22.482 --> 16:24.442

16:22.482 --> 16:24.442
AND I'M SORRY.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.693
IT'S OKAY.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.194
I'VE BEEN IN HARTFORD

16:27.236 --> 16:29.113

21:32.959 --> 21:34.752
WELL, HE PROUDLY OFFERED.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.922
HE SAID IT WAS A RECIPE PASSED

21:34.794 --> 21:37.922
DOWN BY SOME DEAD RELATIVE.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.466
STEW? THAT MAY BE

21:37.964 --> 21:40.466
WHAT<i> KILLED</i> HIS RELATIVE.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.135
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.428
PROMISE ME YOU'LL MAKE HIM

21:42.176 --> 21:44.428
PREPARE PROPER FOOD FOR YOU.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.555
PLEASE.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.555
THAT'S WHAT HE'S PAID FOR.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.723
I PROMISE, EMILY.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.809
HERE WE GO.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.809
AHH, LOOKS PERFECT.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.186
AND IT'S CHIPPED, SO JUST

21:49.850 --> 21:52.186
TOSS IT WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.187
THANK YOU, EMILY.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.313
YOU'RE WELCOME.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.065
AND THE STEW IS HISTORY.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.275
GOOD.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.862
FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER,

22:01.904 --> 22:04.198
THIS WOMAN MADE EYES

22:01.904 --> 22:04.198
AT THE BRITISH GENERAL,

22:04.240 --> 22:07.534
AND THE BRITISH GENERAL

22:04.240 --> 22:07.534
WAS FEELING A LITTLE RANDY.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.495
SUCH A SALACIOUS HISTORY

22:07.576 --> 22:09.495
OUR TOWN HAS.

22:09.536 --> 22:12.206
SHE LED HIM INTO HER HOUSE

22:09.536 --> 22:12.206
AND KEPT THE FELLOW OCCUPIED.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.373
OCCUPIED HIS BRAINS OUT,

22:12.248 --> 22:13.373
HUH?

22:13.415 --> 22:14.834
Hey, don't work blue.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.834
SORRY.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.543
But why do you think

22:14.875 --> 22:16.543
they didn't just kill him?

22:16.585 --> 22:17.878
I DON'T KNOW.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.588
MAYBE THEY KNEW THAT WE

22:17.920 --> 22:19.588
WOULD ULTIMATELY

22:19.630 --> 22:21.340
MAKE PEACE WITH ENGLAND,

22:19.630 --> 22:21.340
AND THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO KILL

22:21.381 --> 22:23.884
A POTENTIAL

22:21.381 --> 22:23.884
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER

22:23.926 --> 22:25.845
OF A WINSTON CHURCHILL

22:23.926 --> 22:25.845
OR A BENNY HILL.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.763
WELL, THAT WAS

22:25.886 --> 22:27.763
VERY FORWARD-THINKING OF THEM.

22:27.805 --> 22:30.474
BOY, DO I KNOW HOW TO DRESS

22:27.805 --> 22:30.474
A SLUT OR WHAT? I'M VERY PROUD.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.018
SO, YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING

22:30.516 --> 22:32.018
ABOUT OUR FIRST SNOW.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.186
THAT'S RIGHT, I HAVEN'T.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.812
YOU DON'T SOUND

22:33.227 --> 22:34.812
SO EXCITED.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.106
Snow and I had

22:34.854 --> 22:37.106
a bit of a bumpy ride today.

22:34.854 --> 22:37.106
BUMMER.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.817
I BLAME MYSELF.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.817
I MAY HAVE BEEN TOO NEEDY

22:37.148 --> 22:39.817
WITH SNOW -- TOO CLINGY.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.153
IT HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PUSH ME

22:39.859 --> 22:42.153
AWAY, CREATE A BOUNDARY.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.570
SNOW AND MEN HAVE

22:42.195 --> 22:43.570
A LOT IN COMMON.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.323
What about you?

22:43.612 --> 22:45.323
Anything exciting happen today?

22:45.363 --> 22:48.034
YOU GET IN A SNOWBALL FIGHT

22:45.363 --> 22:48.034
WITH A NOBEL PRIZE WINNER?

22:48.075 --> 22:51.411
NO, NO, NOTHING

22:48.075 --> 22:51.411
OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.665
UH, BUT I'M SORRY THAT SNOW

22:51.453 --> 22:54.665
WAS SO MEAN TO YOU TODAY.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.375
OH, IT'S OKAY.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.375
IT WASN'T SNOW'S FAULT.

22:57.417 --> 22:58.711
WE HAD ONE BAD DAY.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.088
EVERY RELATIONSHIP

22:58.752 --> 23:01.088
HAS ITS BAD DAYS.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.380
DOESN'T MEAN

23:01.130 --> 23:02.380
YOU DROP AND RUN.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.133
YOU KEEP GOING, RIGHT?

23:04.175 --> 23:06.760
PEAKS AND VALLEYS

23:04.175 --> 23:06.760
KEEP A RELATIONSHIP FRESH.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.638
I AGREE.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.638
TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.602
[ SIGHS ]

23:21.525 --> 23:22.484
[ GASPS ]

23:22.526 --> 23:23.610
NO.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.201
[ SIGHS ]

23:32.536 --> 23:33.954
DON'T DO THAT.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.998
I WANT IT GONE! GONE!

23:33.996 --> 23:35.998
I'M GETTING IT GONE.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.499
BUT THIS IS PERSONAL.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.169
I'M PHYSICALLY HURTING THE SNOW

23:37.541 --> 23:40.169
AS I DIG AT IT.

23:40.211 --> 23:42.796
I'M CHOPPING

23:40.211 --> 23:42.796
INTO ITS STUPID WHITE FACE

23:42.838 --> 23:44.422
WITH MY RAZOR-SHARP

23:42.838 --> 23:44.422
FINGERNAIL CLAWS,

23:44.464 --> 23:46.300
AND I'M DELIGHTING IN IT.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.300
I WANT IT TO SUFFER!

23:46.342 --> 23:47.885
YOU LOOK DERANGED.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.553
TAKE THAT! AND THAT!

23:49.595 --> 23:51.222
WHY DID YOU PARK IT

23:49.595 --> 23:51.222
UNDER A TREE?

23:51.264 --> 23:53.640
I HAVE BEEN PARKING THIS CAR

23:51.264 --> 23:53.640
UNDER THIS STUPID TREE FOREVER.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.142
BUT IT'S SNOWING.

23:55.184 --> 23:57.061
YES, BUT SNOW HAS ALWAYS

23:55.184 --> 23:57.061
PROTECTED ME BEFORE.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.272
IT'S BEEN A WHITE BLANKET

23:57.103 --> 23:59.272
OF LOVE.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.023
WE HAD A SYMBIOTIC THING

23:59.313 --> 24:01.023
GOING ON.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.440
SNOW CANNOT PROTECT YOU.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.610
SNOW IS FROZEN WATER

24:02.482 --> 24:04.610
FALLING OUT OF THE SKY.

24:04.651 --> 24:06.195
AS FOR THIS CAR

24:04.651 --> 24:06.195
AND THIS TREE,

24:06.237 --> 24:08.030
YOU CAN PREDICT IT --

24:06.237 --> 24:08.030
IT'S GRAVITY.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.241
THERE'S 4 TONS OF SNOW

24:08.072 --> 24:10.241
ON THIS TREE.

24:10.283 --> 24:12.034
YOU PARK UNDER IT,

24:10.283 --> 24:12.034
GRAVITY'S GONNA COME INTO PLAY

24:12.076 --> 24:13.702
AND TAKE IT OUT.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.702
IT'S BASIC PHYSICS.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.246
I DO NOT NEED

24:13.744 --> 24:15.246
A PHYSICS LESSON RIGHT NOW,

24:15.288 --> 24:17.248
NO MATTER HOW WELL

24:15.288 --> 24:17.248
IT'S INTENTIONED.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.248
SORRY.

24:17.290 --> 24:20.751
IT'S OVER.

24:17.290 --> 24:20.751
OH, YES, IT IS OVER!

24:20.793 --> 24:22.002
WHAT IS?

24:22.044 --> 24:23.837
ME AND SNOW.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.837
WE'RE THROUGH.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.089
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

24:25.131 --> 24:26.715
IT WAS YEARS OF BLISS,

24:25.131 --> 24:26.715
YOU KNOW.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.884
WE HAD SOME GOOD STUFF

24:26.757 --> 24:28.884
AND GOOD TIMES.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.345
I COULD SHOW YOU PICTURES

24:28.926 --> 24:31.345
OF THE SNOW ANGELS I MADE,

24:31.387 --> 24:32.721
BUT I AM DONE!

24:31.387 --> 24:32.721
DONE!

24:32.763 --> 24:34.265
WELL, LET IT DOWN EASY,

24:32.763 --> 24:34.265
OKAY?

24:34.307 --> 24:37.726
OH, AND I AM CHANGING MY

24:34.307 --> 24:37.726
CANCELATION POLICY AT THE INN.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.228
BECAUSE OF SNOW?

24:37.768 --> 24:39.228
YES!

24:39.270 --> 24:40.980
FROM NOW ON,

24:39.270 --> 24:40.980
IF ANYONE CANCELS

24:41.021 --> 24:43.023
FOR ANY REASON

24:41.021 --> 24:43.023
THAT I DON'T AGREE WITH,

24:43.065 --> 24:46.319
WITHIN TWO YEARS OF THE DATE

24:43.065 --> 24:46.319
IN QUESTION -- MAKE IT THREE --

24:46.360 --> 24:48.486
THEN I AM NOT

24:46.360 --> 24:48.486
GOING TO REFUND THEIR MONEY,

24:48.528 --> 24:51.240
<i>AND</i> I'M GONNA KICK THEM

24:48.528 --> 24:51.240
IN THE GROIN!

24:48.528 --> 24:51.240
GEEZ.

24:51.282 --> 24:52.490
BUT WITH MY LEFT FOOT

24:52.532 --> 24:54.285
BECAUSE MY RIGHT FOOT

24:52.532 --> 24:54.285
IS STILL THROBBING

24:54.327 --> 24:56.996
FROM BEING FROZEN

24:54.327 --> 24:56.996
IN ICY HOLE WATER,

24:57.037 --> 24:59.581
WHICH HAS EFFECTIVELY ENDED

24:57.037 --> 24:59.581
MY FOOT-MODELING CAREER.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.499
FOOT MODELING

24:59.623 --> 25:01.499
IS A DYING ART, ANYWAY.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.960
I AM WITH YOU NOW,

25:01.541 --> 25:02.960
BUDDY, 100%.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.420
WITH ME ON WHAT?

25:04.462 --> 25:08.090
SNOW IS NOTHING BUT ANNOYING

25:04.462 --> 25:08.090
ICY FROZEN-WATER STUFF

25:08.132 --> 25:10.426
THAT FALLS OUT OF THE SKY

25:08.132 --> 25:10.426
AT INCONVENIENT TIMES.

25:10.468 --> 25:13.762
IT'S MOTHER NATURE'S ICY

25:10.468 --> 25:13.762
"SCREW YOU, LORELAI GILMORE."

25:13.804 --> 25:15.764
IT'S STUPID STUFF YOU HAVE TO

25:13.804 --> 25:15.764
SHOVEL OUT OF THE WAY

25:15.806 --> 25:17.475
SO CUSTOMERS CAN GET

25:15.806 --> 25:17.475
INTO THE INN.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.643
IT'S THE STUFF THAT MELTS

25:17.515 --> 25:19.643
AND LEAKS THROUGH YOUR ROOF.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.103
IT'S THE STUFF

25:19.685 --> 25:21.103
THAT STALLS YOUR CAR.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.313
IT'S THE STUFF

25:21.145 --> 25:22.313
THAT BURIES YOUR CAR.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.106
OH, NO! NO!

25:24.148 --> 25:26.900
DON'T EVEN TRY TO MAKE UP WITH

25:24.148 --> 25:26.900
ME NOW! YOU AND ME ARE THROUGH!

25:26.942 --> 25:29.862
Lorelai: YOU STUPID --

25:26.942 --> 25:29.862
I HATE YOU.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.700
HELLO, ROBERT.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.700
GOOD EVENING, LADIES.

25:34.741 --> 25:35.701
HELLO, GIRLS.

25:35.742 --> 25:36.869
HI, GRANDPA.

25:35.742 --> 25:36.869
HI, DAD.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.162
YOU COME TOGETHER TONIGHT?

25:38.204 --> 25:39.997
OH, NO,

25:38.204 --> 25:39.997
JUST A LUCKY COINCIDENCE.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.833
WELL.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.833
HELLO, MOM.

25:42.875 --> 25:43.834
HELLO, GIRLS.

25:43.876 --> 25:44.835
HI, GRANDMA.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.128
JUST GO ABOUT YOUR DRINKS.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.587
I'M JUST HERE

25:46.170 --> 25:47.587
TO SIT WITH THE DOG.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.006
THE DOG?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.006
OH, HE'S CUTE.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.757
WHEN DID YOU GET A DOG?

25:50.799 --> 25:52.134
SHE'S NOT<i> OUR</i> DOG.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.134
I'M NO LESS CONFUSED.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.135
AND IT'S A "HE."

25:53.177 --> 25:54.345
THE DOG?

25:54.387 --> 25:55.595
THE DOG IS A BOY.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.972
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

25:55.637 --> 25:56.972
IT WAS A GIRL.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.098
I GOT ANOTHER PEEK.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.392
IT WAS ROLLING AROUND

25:58.140 --> 25:59.392
ON ITS BACK,

25:59.433 --> 26:00.726
AND IT WAS PAINFULLY OBVIOUS.

26:00.767 --> 26:01.727
THEY'RE SO HAIRY

26:00.767 --> 26:01.727
DOWN THERE.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.020
THIS ONE ESPECIALLY.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.813
IT'S GOING FROM WEIRD

26:03.062 --> 26:04.813
TO WEIRDER.

26:04.855 --> 26:05.814
THE USUAL BEVERAGE

26:04.855 --> 26:05.814
FOR EVERYBODY?

26:05.856 --> 26:07.233
SO, HE'S NOT YOUR DOG?

26:07.274 --> 26:09.567
IT JUST SHOWED UP IN OUR YARD

26:07.274 --> 26:09.567
YESTERDAY MORNING.

26:09.609 --> 26:11.695
WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT GOT HERE,

26:09.609 --> 26:11.695
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.030
IT HAS NO TAG.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.823
IT IS A VERY BIG MYSTERY,

26:13.072 --> 26:14.823
THIS DOG.

26:14.865 --> 26:17.535
OH, I'M MONOPOLIZING THINGS,

26:14.865 --> 26:17.535
AND I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

26:17.575 --> 26:19.286
PLEASE, GO ABOUT

26:17.575 --> 26:19.286
YOUR DRINKS.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.914
NO, I'M HAVING ROBERT

26:19.328 --> 26:21.914
MAKE ONE UP FOR YOU, AS WELL.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.999
ARE YOU SURE? BECAUSE I'M NOT

26:21.955 --> 26:23.999
OFFICIALLY HERE.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.834
ABSOLUTELY.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.420
THANK YOU, RICHARD.

26:27.461 --> 26:29.129
SO, HOW LONG ARE YOU

26:27.461 --> 26:29.129
GONNA KEEP HIM?

26:29.171 --> 26:30.672
AS LONG AS IT TAKES

26:29.171 --> 26:30.672
TO FIND THE OWNERS.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.508
RICHARD HAD TO MISS A HALF DAY

26:30.714 --> 26:32.508
OF WORK YESTERDAY.

26:32.550 --> 26:35.761
BUT EMILY HAS AGREED TO WRITE

26:32.550 --> 26:35.761
A NOTE EXCUSING MY ABSENCE,

26:35.802 --> 26:37.513
SO IT SHOULD BE OKAY.

26:37.555 --> 26:40.015
OKAY, NOW PRETEND

26:37.555 --> 26:40.015
I'M NOT HERE.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.599
YOU GIRLS AND I

26:40.057 --> 26:41.599
CAN CHAT LATER.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.018
OKAY. HEH HEH.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.396
WELL, UM, RORY...
