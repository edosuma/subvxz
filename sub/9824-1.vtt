WEBVTT

02:24.394 --> 02:27.396
His Highness Prince Yu arrives!

02:29.732 --> 02:30.899
Your Majesty.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.152
Yu, is everything ready?

02:36.447 --> 02:38.574
Mother, Second Brother
should be here soon.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.409
Has he entered the Palace?

02:40.577 --> 02:43.245
I hear he stopped at the Official Inn
to await orders.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.665
First Brother mentioned
that as soon as Father arrives. . .

02:46.833 --> 02:48.750
. . . he will ask permission to leave.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.128
He wants to go to Qingzhou.

03:13.985 --> 03:14.985
Mother.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.960
Her Majesty the Empress arrives!

03:40.136 --> 03:41.303
First Brother.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.306
Your Majesty.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.414
So you are leaving.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.668
Are you afraid?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.128
You are my mother, Your Majesty.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.633
We have been intimate
for three years.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.843
You, of all people
should know who I am.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.721
I am first and foremost
my father's son.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.940
Mother!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.566
I am not your mother!

04:41.698 --> 04:43.532
Many things can be changed.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.785
In fact, nothing can be changed.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.540
Still, I would like to try.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.710
What are you going to do?

04:55.586 --> 04:58.797
It is time to go and welcome
the Emperor.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.606
The day breaks.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.900
The court presides.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.569
Peace to all.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.988
It is the Hour of the Tiger.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.326
The day breaks.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.578
The court presides.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.288
Peace to all.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.666
It is the Hour of the Tiger.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.548
Your servant kneels
before the Empress.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.134
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is ready.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.136
By the Emperor's command. . .

07:09.303 --> 07:10.887
. . . retire to your chambers!

07:11.055 --> 07:13.098
The welcome ceremony is cancelled !

07:13.599 --> 07:15.434
Retire to your chambers!

07:15.601 --> 07:17.352
The welcome ceremony is cancelled !

07:17.854 --> 07:19.271
The Emperor commands. . .

07:19.439 --> 07:21.022
. . . retire to your chambers!

07:21.190 --> 07:23.191
The welcome ceremony is cancelled !

07:23.526 --> 07:25.193
Retire to your chambers!

07:25.403 --> 07:27.195
The welcome ceremony is cancelled !

07:27.613 --> 07:31.074
Your Majesty, the Emperor commands
everyone to return to their chambers.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.160
The welcome ceremony is cancelled.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.830
-Where is His Majesty?
-The Emperor has diverted his escort. . .

07:36.998 --> 07:38.748
. . .to the Official Inn.
Your Majesty. . .

07:38.916 --> 07:42.335
. . .the Emperor requests the presence
of the Empress and the two princes. . .

07:42.503 --> 07:45.130
. . .on the Chrysanthemum Terrace
tomorrow morning.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.966
THE OFFICIAL INN

07:53.806 --> 07:56.475
Your Highness Prince Jai,
the Emperor has arrived.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.190
Your son kneels before the Emperor.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.086
I am honored
by Father's personal visit.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.731
Come.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.107
Father's prowess is unequalled.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.236
The decision to send you
to the frontier. . .

10:13.404 --> 10:14.863
. . .was clearly the right one.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.490
I came here today. . .

10:17.658 --> 10:19.576
. . .to warn you. . .

10:20.036 --> 10:21.703
. . .against your past mistakes.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.041
There are many things
in Heaven and Earth. . .

10:26.208 --> 10:29.461
. . . but you can only have
what I choose to give you.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.129
What I do not give. . .

10:31.547 --> 10:33.423
. . .you must never take by force.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.593
Father's counsel
is etched into my heart.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.562
Return to the Palace with me.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.834
His Highness Prince Jai arrives!

11:10.002 --> 11:11.753
Jai.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.093
Your son kneels before the Empress.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.682
Mother.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.852
It has been over three years.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.979
Have you been well?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.528
I am very well.

11:40.616 --> 11:41.616
And you?

11:41.867 --> 11:44.160
I have missed Mother. . .

11:44.328 --> 11:46.287
. . .every moment of every day.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.500
Mother.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.672
You must have suffered.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.007
I am fine.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.889
Charity seeks no recognition.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.058
Virtue seeks no reward.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.060
The harvest is abundant.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.562
It is the Hour of the Rabbit.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.817
Your Majesty. . .

13:40.444 --> 13:44.906
. . .the Empress has been taking her
medicine daily without interruption.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.077
Following Your Majesty's instruction. . .

13:49.620 --> 13:52.622
. . .the black fungus is added personally
by my daughter, Chan.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.291
Nobody knows
about the new ingredient.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.171
Has it been ten days now?

14:00.339 --> 14:01.965
Exactly ten days.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.635
Is your relationship
with Father unchanged?

14:13.853 --> 14:16.145
Why is Mother embroidering
so many chrysanthemums?

14:16.647 --> 14:18.815
It is the Chrysanthemum Festival
soon, remember?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.324
Mother! Mother!

14:28.784 --> 14:31.619
-Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
-What is the matter?

14:31.787 --> 14:33.705
Your Highness,
your servant does not know.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.874
It is the third time
this has happened.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.224
Mother's illness is clearly serious.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.685
Have you been
taking your medicine?

15:07.031 --> 15:08.489
Have a rest.

15:09.658 --> 15:13.828
Before the Chrysanthemum Festival,
I must finish all the embroidery.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.337
Why don't you go
and see your brothers?

15:25.257 --> 15:27.383
His Highness Prince Jai arrives!

15:28.510 --> 15:30.929
Jai bows to his First Brother,
the Crown Prince Wan.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.722
Second Brother, please sit.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.265
Thank you.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.351
-Second Brother.
-Yu.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.233
Second Brother, I hear Father changed
his plans and welcomed you in person.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.527
We all waited up half the night in vain.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.698
These years away from home
must have been hard.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.742
It was fine.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.454
Do you know what is wrong
with Mother?

15:57.456 --> 15:59.540
Father says
she suffers from anemia.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.460
She has been taking her
medicine regularly.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.551
She seems to be obsessed
with embroidering chrysanthemums.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.930
They must be for the Festival.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.748
Dad !

16:44.253 --> 16:46.587
Have you been visiting
with the Crown Prince again?

16:46.755 --> 16:50.717
-Why would I visit the Crown Prince?
-Father knows.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.428
What do you know?

16:53.929 --> 16:55.722
Go more often !

17:12.906 --> 17:15.783
This is a Persian black fungus.
Do you know its properties?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.953
Two grams a day,
taken over a few months. . .

17:19.246 --> 17:21.789
. . .will cause a person to lose
all their mental faculty.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.546
And you think you know so much.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.257
-But the Empress--
-Don't breathe a word.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.176
Our entire clan will be executed !

17:49.735 --> 17:51.903
Law of the nation. . .

17:52.571 --> 17:54.447
. . . precept of the home. . .

17:55.157 --> 17:56.824
. . .ancient yet unchanged.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.826
It is the Hour of the Dragon.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.506
Your servant kneels
before the Empress.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.092
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is ready.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.014
So you are Chan.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.308
Yes, Your Majesty.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.853
-The Imperial Doctor is your father?
-Yes.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.320
The Crown Prince
seems a little pale lately.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.826
Is the Empress asking her servant?

18:44.540 --> 18:47.041
My duty is only to prepare
Your Majesty's medicine.

18:47.334 --> 18:50.211
I am not acquainted with
His Highness's state of health.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.213
Is that so?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.469
You may enter.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.245
"To the highest mountains
my brothers ascend. . .

20:06.455 --> 20:09.916
. . . but one is missing,
without berries in his hair."

20:10.459 --> 20:11.959
Prince Jai has returned.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.463
The family is reunited.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.602
Do you know why
every Chrysanthemum Festival. . .

20:29.770 --> 20:32.104
. . .we assemble on this high terrace
as a family?

20:35.108 --> 20:38.527
Father, on the ninth day of the ninth
month the sun and the moon unite.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.780
We call this
the Chrysanthemum Festival.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.366
It symbolizes the strength and harmony
of the family and we always celebrate. . .

20:43.533 --> 20:46.035
-. . .on this high terrace.
-That is a very good answer.

20:46.912 --> 20:50.248
The terrace is round.
The table is square.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.749
What do they represent?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.001
That Heaven is round.
The earth is square.

20:54.169 --> 20:57.004
The law of the Heavens
dictates the rule of earthly life. . .

20:57.172 --> 21:00.841
. . . under the circle, within the square,
everyone has his proper placement.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.135
This is called natural law.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.431
Emperor, Courtier, Father, Son, loyalty,
filial piety, ritual and righteousness. . .

21:07.641 --> 21:10.017
. . .all relationships obey this law.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.103
Do you have any requests?

21:12.521 --> 21:13.604
Your Majesty. . .

21:13.772 --> 21:15.523
. . . I beg permission. . .

21:15.691 --> 21:17.858
. . .to travel to Qingzhou.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.986
You also wish
to be sent to the frontier?

21:20.362 --> 21:21.779
I have never left the Palace. . .

21:21.947 --> 21:24.991
. . .and would like to gain experience
in the outside world.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.039
Is there anything else?

21:32.874 --> 21:34.041
Father.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.669
-I beg your permission also.
-What is it?

21:36.878 --> 21:39.839
I do not know
if it would be appropriate. . . .

21:40.048 --> 21:42.008
Then speak when you do know.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.807
You did not finish the medicine
served at the Hour of the Dragon.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.729
Is there any left?

21:56.231 --> 21:58.566
Your Majesty,
there is a sip or two.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.401
-Serve it to the Empress.
-Yes.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.361
Your Majesty. . .

22:03.030 --> 22:04.530
. . .your consort is not ill.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.532
That is your opinion.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.582
Medicine has to be taken in the
right measure, at the right time.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.835
Everything abides by its own law.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.394
Yu.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.568
Mother, please do not upset Father.

22:50.410 --> 22:53.454
Mother, please take the medicine.

22:57.626 --> 23:01.295
Remain kneeling
until your mother drains the cup.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.556
Father,
Mother does not wish to drink.

23:12.766 --> 23:15.643
-Why not let her be?
-Medicine is governed by dosage. . .

23:16.311 --> 23:20.064
. . .just as life is governed by its own
law. Surely you all know this.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.745
Mother, you have been taking
this medicine for years.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.831
This is only a little sip.

23:37.624 --> 23:38.666
Why refuse?

23:45.424 --> 23:46.841
You are right.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.886
I have been taking
this medicine for years. . .

23:54.433 --> 23:55.850
. . .why refuse now?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.543
Your mother is not well.

24:23.211 --> 24:26.213
-Are you not aware?
-We know, Father.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.800
If a person is sick,
they have to be treated.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.385
Why is this unusual?

24:37.225 --> 24:39.351
What were you trying
to say just now?

24:39.811 --> 24:43.647
Father, I would like on the night
of the Chrysanthemum Festival. . .

24:43.815 --> 24:46.358
. . . I would like to command
the Imperial Guards.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.736
I, too, wish to gain experience.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.573
Since Prince Jai has returned. . .

24:52.908 --> 24:55.242
. . . he will assume this duty.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.038
-Jai.
-Present, Father.

24:59.414 --> 25:02.541
The Imperial Guards
protect our private palaces.

25:03.001 --> 25:07.004
On the night of the Festival,
they will be under your sole command.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.255
Do you understand?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.257
Father's trust will not be misplaced.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.428
You know what to do.

25:22.103 --> 25:25.189
The Empress arrives.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.740
Your consort kneels
before the Emperor.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.541
Do you know why I summoned you?

25:44.793 --> 25:46.126
Today. . .

25:46.753 --> 25:48.629
. . .you acted against
the family's wishes.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.298
Watch closely.

25:54.302 --> 25:58.222
I select each ingredient personally
with utmost care.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.101
This will cure your anemia.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.478
I thank His Majesty for his concern.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.480
All good medicine tastes bitter.

26:06.648 --> 26:10.818
You have excess bile, poor digestion,
Yin and Yang are out of balance.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.861
That is why you are fractious. . .

26:13.029 --> 26:15.823
. . . listless and lethargic. . .

26:16.074 --> 26:18.784
. . .capable of nothing
but cutting remarks.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.661
These are all symptoms of anemia.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.663
It has been more than ten years.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.998
My so-called sickness. . .

26:24.583 --> 26:27.459
. . . is clearly not improving
with Your Majesty's treatment.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.805
If your father
were not the King of Liang. . .

26:40.265 --> 26:44.018
. . . I would scarcely be speaking
with you with such restraint.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.646
You had better understand
that as long as I am the Emperor. . .

26:48.023 --> 26:49.648
. . .and you the Empress. . .

26:50.317 --> 26:52.234
. . .we shall play our parts
to perfection.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.028
The Imperial Family. . .

26:54.279 --> 26:56.614
. . . has to set an example
for the entire country.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.120
For the sake of this family. . .

27:04.706 --> 27:07.625
. . .there is much
that I am prepared to tolerate. . .

27:07.792 --> 27:11.211
. . . because my concern is to
maintain law and order in the home.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.049
Chickens roost.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.384
Gentlemen to rest.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.219
Streams run clear.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.388
It is the Hour of the Snake.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.233
Your servant kneels
before the Empress.

27:33.401 --> 27:35.569
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is served.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.322
Thank you, Your Majesty.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.356
Do you know what day
it is tomorrow?

29:36.858 --> 29:38.484
The Chrysanthemum Festival. . .

29:38.651 --> 29:40.527
. . .the day my birth mother died.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.988
You lost your mother
when you were small. . .

29:43.448 --> 29:45.991
. . .and I was away at war
much of the time.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.202
I never took proper care of you.

29:49.287 --> 29:52.706
This has created a distance
between us. . .

29:53.708 --> 29:56.877
. . . but you have always been
my favorite son.

29:57.712 --> 29:59.463
I asked Jai to come back. . .

29:59.714 --> 30:02.049
. . .and gave him
a heavy responsibility tonight.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.218
Did you wonder why?

30:04.803 --> 30:07.554
Father is thinking of. . .

30:07.889 --> 30:09.807
. . . making Jai the Crown Prince.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.017
If this makes you uncomfortable. . .

30:12.811 --> 30:14.478
. . . I shall not go ahead.

30:14.729 --> 30:15.896
Father need not worry.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.899
I am without talent
and do not deserve the throne.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.194
Twice in the past I begged Father
to appoint another heir.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.779
I had meant it sincerely.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.739
Father's wish is my wish.

30:38.253 --> 30:39.920
How did you manage to sneak away?

30:47.345 --> 30:50.430
Did the Emperor grant you
permission to leave for Qingzhou?

31:02.402 --> 31:05.279
After the Festival,
if Your Highness asks again. . .

31:05.530 --> 31:07.781
. . . I am sure the Emperor
will say yes.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.707
Your Highness, please do not forget
to take Chan with you.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.422
Once there. . .

31:23.590 --> 31:25.632
. . .we shall finally be together.

31:26.467 --> 31:28.385
If only I could get away. . . .

31:29.554 --> 31:31.638
It will happen !

32:24.525 --> 32:27.653
Her Majesty the Empress arrives!

32:45.630 --> 32:46.713
Your Majesty.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.853
You can tell her to come out.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.398
What did Mother say?

33:05.066 --> 33:06.191
Tell her to come out!

33:07.318 --> 33:08.443
Mother. . . .

33:13.533 --> 33:14.908
Come out!

33:26.713 --> 33:29.423
-What is the punishment?
-For seducing the Crown Prince. . .

33:29.590 --> 33:33.051
. . .trespassing into royal chambers,
by law 20 lashes of the whip. . .

33:33.219 --> 33:36.346
. . . branding of the face,
and banishment from the Palace.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.227
Your Highness,
what do you suggest?

33:49.110 --> 33:51.945
What happened here
was entirely my fault.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.448
For my sake, I beg Your Majesty. . .

33:55.199 --> 33:56.783
. . .to exercise lenience.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.041
Mother, please spare her.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.178
Fine.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.473
I shall let her go this time. . .

34:20.975 --> 34:24.311
. . . but I do this for the sake
of another, not you.

34:26.314 --> 34:27.481
You may rise.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.370
I am not trying to make things
difficult for you.

34:42.538 --> 34:46.166
But before the Festival, nothing
untoward must happen in the Palace.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.901
Leave me.

36:22.096 --> 36:25.432
I have made the discovery
Your Majesty requested.

36:31.272 --> 36:34.482
The new ingredient in your prescription
is a black fungus from Persia.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.776
Two grams a day,
over a few months. . .

36:37.028 --> 36:40.572
. . .will cause a person
to lose all their mental faculty.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.374
Thank you.

36:58.257 --> 37:00.175
I did not do this for money.

37:00.593 --> 37:01.801
Then why did you?

37:01.969 --> 37:06.181
The Empress may think that I came
because of the generous reward.

37:10.686 --> 37:14.147
But I came
for my own reasons.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.359
I hate this man.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.945
Only Your Majesty is in a position
to avenge me.

37:20.488 --> 37:24.032
I see that your face is branded.
Why were you in jail?

37:24.492 --> 37:28.161
Your Majesty,
forgive my silence on this subject.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.497
Farewell.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.552
Your Highness, Prince Wan.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.638
The Empress has already retired.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.303
Who are you?

40:14.829 --> 40:16.329
-Father.
-Your Majesty.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.540
This is the wife
of the Imperial Doctor.

40:19.041 --> 40:23.086
Father, this woman broke
into the Palace three days ago.

40:27.883 --> 40:28.925
Raise your head.

40:41.105 --> 40:42.230
Loosen the ties!

40:45.860 --> 40:47.444
Leave us!

40:51.699 --> 40:52.866
Wan. . .

40:53.159 --> 40:56.286
. . .you must never speak
of the events of this night.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.079
Remember!

41:10.217 --> 41:11.384
You may rise.

41:25.941 --> 41:28.067
It has been 25 years.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.445
I thought. . .

41:31.155 --> 41:33.323
. . .that I would never see you again.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.748
And you married the Imperial Doctor!

41:48.756 --> 41:51.591
At the time
you were only a lowly captain. . .

41:51.759 --> 41:53.760
. . . plotting day and night
to become Emperor.

41:53.928 --> 41:58.515
You flattered the King of Liang
into letting you marry his daughter.

41:58.682 --> 42:02.268
You planned meticulously to have
my entire family put in prison. Later. . .

42:02.978 --> 42:04.896
. . . I alone managed to escape.

42:05.814 --> 42:07.982
Far from home, I almost died.

42:08.442 --> 42:10.443
It was the doctor who saved me.

42:10.861 --> 42:13.488
Who, then, do you think
I should have married?

42:21.455 --> 42:24.666
-Why did you come?
-I came to see my son.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.169
I suppose the Empress invited you.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.088
I have never even met the Empress.

42:55.906 --> 42:57.782
What I owe you. . .

42:58.367 --> 43:00.034
. . . I shall repay in full.

43:00.411 --> 43:03.371
The Imperial Doctor. . .

43:03.831 --> 43:05.540
. . . has served us for many years. . .

43:05.708 --> 43:08.167
. . .with impeccable conduct,
loyalty and honesty.

43:08.335 --> 43:11.421
He is promoted
to Governor of Suzhou. . .

43:11.672 --> 43:13.423
. . .also Commander of Chariots.

43:13.632 --> 43:15.800
He will depart immediately. . .

43:15.968 --> 43:17.427
. . .with his daughter, Chan.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.512
This is the order of His Majesty.

43:19.930 --> 43:21.973
We thank His Majesty
for his gracious favor.

43:29.231 --> 43:32.317
Your humble servant kneels
before the Emperor.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.616
Before I leave. . .

43:40.117 --> 43:42.577
. . . I beg to serve Your Majesty
one last time.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.954
How long have you been with me?

43:45.122 --> 43:47.874
Your Majesty, it has been 1 5 years.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.793
If I have ever wronged you. . .

43:52.087 --> 43:53.463
. . . please forgive me.

43:53.881 --> 43:55.757
Your Majesty
must not say such things!

43:56.175 --> 43:58.384
Your servant would willingly
give his life.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.303
Your wife. . .

44:02.848 --> 44:04.474
. . . is she well?

44:06.352 --> 44:07.352
She is.

44:07.519 --> 44:10.438
She will accompany you
to your new post.

44:10.856 --> 44:12.690
Your Majesty is too considerate.

44:13.692 --> 44:15.401
My gratitude is without bounds.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.321
As for the Empress's medicine. . .

44:18.614 --> 44:20.823
. . . I have prepared
two months' supply.

44:21.909 --> 44:24.077
Your Majesty need only command
the pharmacist. . .

44:24.244 --> 44:26.120
. . .to heat up each dose
as necessary.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.543
Your consort
kneels before the Emperor.

45:15.295 --> 45:16.879
Leave us.

45:24.888 --> 45:28.182
I came to pay respects
to the Crown Prince's birth mother.

45:28.851 --> 45:30.977
Today is the anniversary
of her death.

45:46.660 --> 45:49.996
For over 20 years this portrait
has kept Your Majesty company.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.082
In your heart. . .

45:54.585 --> 45:57.253
. . .there is only one woman.

46:04.928 --> 46:07.346
What have you come to say?

46:08.098 --> 46:10.892
I hear that an assassin
was captured last night. . .

46:12.144 --> 46:15.480
. . .and the Emperor spent a long time
interrogating him.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.982
Is anything wrong with that?

46:19.026 --> 46:20.109
Of course not.

46:22.988 --> 46:24.614
I shall take my leave now.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.626
His Highness Prince Jai arrives.

46:37.544 --> 46:39.545
Leave us, all of you.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.639
Mother.

46:51.141 --> 46:53.935
I have been taking your father's
medicine for over ten years.

46:54.102 --> 46:56.854
Ten days ago,
he suddenly changed the formula. . .

47:00.984 --> 47:04.278
. . .and this new ingredient
was added.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.457
Mother was taken ill yesterday.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.793
Was it because of this?

47:25.384 --> 47:26.884
Why is Father doing this to you?

47:29.179 --> 47:30.638
Jai. . .

47:36.436 --> 47:39.939
. . .after the Chrysanthemum Festival,
I shall tell you the whole truth.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.994
Each day, in front of your father. . .

47:53.662 --> 47:56.205
. . . I have to feign ignorance.

47:57.916 --> 47:59.333
Every two hours. . .

47:59.501 --> 48:02.128
. . . I swallow this poison
without protest.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.341
Nobody knows what is happening.

48:10.554 --> 48:14.724
I shall die exactly
as your father intends. A cretin.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.937
But I refuse to submit without a fight.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.155
On the night of the Festival. . .

48:30.157 --> 48:33.242
. . . I shall put an end to all of this.

48:36.622 --> 48:38.122
Do my brothers know?

48:39.166 --> 48:40.499
No.

48:44.880 --> 48:46.547
If I had not come back. . .

48:46.965 --> 48:48.633
. . .would Mother have gone ahead?

48:49.176 --> 48:50.509
Yes.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.181
Then why did you tell me?

48:57.392 --> 48:59.310
Because I want you to be Emperor.

49:07.402 --> 49:09.070
Are you going to kill Father?

49:10.072 --> 49:12.615
I shall force him to abdicate. . .

49:13.450 --> 49:15.660
. . . but it is not my intention
to kill him.

49:16.995 --> 49:18.204
Mother. . .

49:18.705 --> 49:21.874
. . .a son cannot stand in rebellion
against his father!

49:22.125 --> 49:25.419
Whatever the circumstances,
he is still my father and my Emperor.

49:38.517 --> 49:39.934
Jai. . .

49:42.604 --> 49:45.314
. . . I know that this puts you
in an untenable position.

49:45.816 --> 49:48.859
You do not have to do anything
you do not want.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.121
Prayers in the Spring. . .

50:00.455 --> 50:01.998
. . .tranquility in the Fall. . .

50:02.457 --> 50:03.499
. . .the earth yields.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.543
It is the Hour of the Monkey.

50:24.062 --> 50:25.271
Mother.

51:03.393 --> 51:05.102
Your son will help you.

51:12.611 --> 51:15.696
You will never drink
this poison again.

52:34.442 --> 52:36.861
His Highness,
the Crown Prince arrives!

52:37.237 --> 52:39.864
Mother summoned me.
Is anything the matter?

52:47.247 --> 52:48.581
Please leave us.

52:55.172 --> 52:58.716
I have made a new robe for you,
different from the one last year.

53:01.845 --> 53:04.513
I have added
this chrysanthemum specially.

53:07.392 --> 53:08.767
What does this mean?

53:11.396 --> 53:14.648
-It will protect you from harm.
-Protect me?

53:16.109 --> 53:18.319
What exactly are you plotting?

53:19.696 --> 53:20.988
Wan. . .

53:21.990 --> 53:25.201
. . .on the night of the Chrysanthemum
Festival, you must wear this.

53:25.952 --> 53:27.661
I will not wear it.

53:28.079 --> 53:29.288
You must.

53:29.998 --> 53:31.457
I refuse!

53:34.294 --> 53:35.419
I refuse.

53:35.962 --> 53:37.463
I refuse to wear it!

53:47.599 --> 53:50.434
What in Heaven's name
are you trying to do?

55:35.540 --> 55:37.499
Your Highness!

55:50.388 --> 55:51.889
I received the message. . .

55:52.432 --> 55:55.559
. . .that Your Highness was coming
and have been waiting up all night.

55:57.062 --> 56:00.439
I came here to ask you something.

56:01.733 --> 56:03.734
Why was your mother
at the Palace?

56:04.235 --> 56:06.820
-She came to see me.
-Had she visited you before?

56:07.822 --> 56:09.239
No. Why?

56:11.910 --> 56:14.161
-Do not keep anything from me.
-Never!

56:14.329 --> 56:17.539
I always tell Your Highness
everything I know.

56:19.250 --> 56:22.086
Do you know why the Empress
keeps embroidering chrysanthemums?

56:22.253 --> 56:23.796
I hear they are for the Festival.

56:23.963 --> 56:27.591
The eunuch in charge of weaving
has made 1 0,000 flowers for her.

56:29.969 --> 56:31.303
Ten thousand?

56:34.474 --> 56:36.975
Her Majesty had them all delivered
to General Wu.

56:37.310 --> 56:39.686
-Of the State Army?
-That's right.

56:40.647 --> 56:41.772
How did you know?

56:42.857 --> 56:44.650
I heard my father mention it.

56:45.193 --> 56:47.194
-What else do you know?
-Nothing.

57:00.458 --> 57:02.960
Chan.

57:03.128 --> 57:05.212
My mother is coming. Please hide!

57:05.422 --> 57:07.589
Something is about to happen
at the Palace.

57:07.757 --> 57:09.091
I must go back.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.885
Something terrible. . . .

57:17.767 --> 57:20.144
Your servant kneels
before the Crown Prince.

57:21.354 --> 57:23.021
Your Highness,
may I present my wife.

57:23.356 --> 57:24.731
Quick!

57:25.108 --> 57:26.984
Kneel down,
welcome the Crown Prince!

57:28.695 --> 57:30.028
Leave!

57:33.074 --> 57:34.283
I said leave!

57:34.451 --> 57:36.535
How can you speak to His Highness
in this way?

57:38.455 --> 57:39.955
Mom, this is the Crown Prince!

57:40.123 --> 57:41.957
Leave now! Go!

57:45.753 --> 57:48.338
Please forgive her.

57:51.676 --> 57:52.926
Your Highness. . .

57:53.845 --> 57:54.928
. . . please forgive her.

57:55.346 --> 57:56.430
Please forgive her.

58:04.230 --> 58:05.939
I was such a fool.

58:06.900 --> 58:08.901
I should never have let you
enter the Palace.

58:09.110 --> 58:11.487
His Highness's feelings
for me are true.

58:11.863 --> 58:14.406
The two of you
can never be together.

58:14.741 --> 58:16.575
-But why?
-No reason.

58:17.410 --> 58:19.369
You must never see him again.

58:20.663 --> 58:22.748
Something terrible
is going to happen tonight.

58:22.916 --> 58:25.292
-Mom, I have to go and find him.
-You dare!

58:28.963 --> 58:30.506
What is going on?

58:37.680 --> 58:40.057
Chan, go outside.

59:06.334 --> 59:08.752
For more than ten years. . .

59:10.004 --> 59:13.090
. . . I have never once
asked you about your past.

59:15.176 --> 59:18.262
What exactly have you
been hiding from me?

1:00:27.332 --> 1:00:28.415
Where is Chan?

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:30.876
-Gone to the Palace!
-You fool !

1:00:38.384 --> 1:00:40.636
By royal command,
I am the new Governor of Suzhou !

1:00:40.803 --> 1:00:42.346
Who are you?

1:00:45.642 --> 1:00:57.402
Let's go!

1:01:43.366 --> 1:01:46.368
You must be hiding
something important from me.

1:01:46.869 --> 1:01:49.913
Quick! Go and save our daughter!

1:01:51.874 --> 1:01:53.458
No!

1:02:59.650 --> 1:03:02.027
His Highness
the Crown Prince arrives.

1:03:17.084 --> 1:03:19.586
When will you make your move?

1:03:20.546 --> 1:03:21.588
So you know.

1:03:24.801 --> 1:03:25.801
How did you find out?

1:03:26.469 --> 1:03:29.554
It is not your concern. When do you
plan to make your move?

1:03:39.565 --> 1:03:41.566
The night
of the Chrysanthemum Festival.

1:03:49.116 --> 1:03:51.701
What are you afraid of?
This has nothing to do with you.

1:03:51.869 --> 1:03:53.745
How can it have nothing
to do with me?

1:03:54.205 --> 1:03:59.167
I am the Crown Prince. The entire
country is going to think I planned it all.

1:04:02.213 --> 1:04:03.797
So what if you did?

1:04:12.306 --> 1:04:14.057
You lunatic!

1:04:14.559 --> 1:04:16.685
You raving lunatic!

1:04:16.936 --> 1:04:18.603
Father is right.

1:04:18.771 --> 1:04:21.940
You do need to take his medicine
every day until you die!

1:04:22.108 --> 1:04:25.193
-Get out!
-If you proceed with your insane plan. . .

1:04:25.361 --> 1:04:29.322
. . .you are asking me to die.

1:04:30.157 --> 1:04:33.410
All you ever wanted
was for me to die.

1:04:36.289 --> 1:04:37.664
Yes.

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:40.542
I want you to die.

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:16.369
Wan !

1:05:16.537 --> 1:05:19.748
Wan ! Help!

1:05:23.502 --> 1:05:25.754
Your Majesty,
fortunately the wound is not fatal.

1:05:25.922 --> 1:05:27.672
His Highness will recover.

1:06:01.207 --> 1:06:03.291
You must be hiding
something else from me.

1:06:05.294 --> 1:06:07.253
Why are you doing this?

1:06:08.923 --> 1:06:10.715
I have no choice.

1:06:13.594 --> 1:06:14.970
I beg you. . .

1:06:16.597 --> 1:06:17.764
. . . please stop. . .

1:06:19.058 --> 1:06:20.976
. . .for your own good.

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:23.812
I know. . .

1:06:28.567 --> 1:06:30.068
. . . but I cannot do as you say.

1:06:38.411 --> 1:06:39.619
Wan.

1:06:41.580 --> 1:06:44.290
Your father is arriving any moment.

1:08:34.944 --> 1:08:36.694
The secret between the two of you. . .

1:08:37.738 --> 1:08:40.365
. . . has been known to me
for some time.

1:08:40.866 --> 1:08:42.534
Ever since. . .

1:08:43.869 --> 1:08:45.453
. . . night after night. . .

1:08:46.455 --> 1:08:48.748
. . . I have lain in bed
with my eyes open.

1:08:52.128 --> 1:08:54.087
Have you ever considered
how I might feel?

1:08:56.882 --> 1:08:58.216
I do not blame you.

1:08:59.301 --> 1:09:00.927
I know. . .

1:09:01.137 --> 1:09:02.929
. . . it was she who seduced you.

1:09:37.923 --> 1:09:39.507
Father.

1:10:07.703 --> 1:10:09.204
Where is your mother?

1:10:10.372 --> 1:10:12.207
Your Majesty, Mother is dressing.

1:10:12.374 --> 1:10:14.334
I shall go and see if she is ready.

1:10:37.566 --> 1:10:39.067
These berries. . .

1:10:39.568 --> 1:10:41.402
. . .were your birth mother's favorite.

1:10:42.029 --> 1:10:43.321
Even after the Festival. . .

1:10:44.031 --> 1:10:47.492
. . .she would wear them for a few days
to ward off evil spirits.

1:10:48.786 --> 1:10:49.827
Yes.

1:10:50.329 --> 1:10:51.996
Each year, on this day. . .

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:54.582
. . .you too should wear. . .

1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.503
. . .a twig of berries to honor
the memory of your birth mother.

1:10:58.879 --> 1:11:00.338
I shall not forget, Father.

1:12:07.448 --> 1:12:09.282
His Highness!

1:12:12.411 --> 1:12:14.454
His Highness Prince Jai arrives!

1:12:22.671 --> 1:12:24.047
Mother. . .

1:12:26.342 --> 1:12:27.592
. . .what happened with Wan?

1:12:29.553 --> 1:12:31.095
He knows everything.

1:12:37.603 --> 1:12:39.645
Will he tell?

1:12:54.787 --> 1:12:56.954
The chrysanthemums are all ready.

1:12:57.998 --> 1:12:59.957
They deserve to bloom once.

1:13:03.212 --> 1:13:04.712
I understand.

1:13:10.844 --> 1:13:12.261
Jai.

1:13:30.656 --> 1:13:31.823
Go then.

1:15:35.489 --> 1:15:38.824
LOYALTY, FILIAL PIETY,
RITUAL, RIGHTEOUSNESS

1:15:39.326 --> 1:15:40.952
By order of the Commanding Officer:

1:15:41.328 --> 1:15:42.954
To reward your hard work. . .

1:15:43.121 --> 1:15:45.623
. . .a banquet has been prepared.
While at your feast. . .

1:15:45.791 --> 1:15:48.417
. . .your duties will be assumed
by our Commanding Officer.

1:15:48.585 --> 1:15:50.962
Orders received.
We thank our gracious Prince.

1:17:28.727 --> 1:17:30.019
Mom, what is going on?

1:17:30.187 --> 1:17:32.188
The Emperor wants to kill
our entire family.

1:17:32.356 --> 1:17:34.065
Why? Where is Dad?

1:17:46.286 --> 1:17:47.828
The Empress sent help.

1:17:47.996 --> 1:17:50.998
Please, this way.

1:18:01.259 --> 1:18:05.012
Your Majesties, Emperor, Empress,
the Imperial Doctor's family is outside.

1:18:05.597 --> 1:18:06.639
Let them come.

1:18:15.190 --> 1:18:16.649
So it was you who defended them.

1:18:24.241 --> 1:18:25.825
Leave us.

1:18:51.309 --> 1:18:54.061
Your Majesty,
I have come to you still alive.

1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:57.231
It was beneath contempt. . .

1:18:57.649 --> 1:18:59.817
. . .to attack us
under the cloak of darkness.

1:19:00.360 --> 1:19:01.902
Once again you have deceived me.

1:19:03.238 --> 1:19:05.322
You coward and hypocrite.

1:19:10.203 --> 1:19:12.747
My daughter and I stand before you.

1:19:13.498 --> 1:19:14.874
Go ahead, kill us!

1:19:15.333 --> 1:19:17.835
You should not have worked
for the Empress.

1:19:18.879 --> 1:19:20.504
You brought this upon them.

1:19:21.256 --> 1:19:24.258
And my husband and daughter?
They knew nothing about me!

1:19:25.761 --> 1:19:27.845
But they knew
far too much about me.

1:19:30.223 --> 1:19:31.640
Father. . .

1:19:32.267 --> 1:19:33.768
-. . .who is she?
-Wan !

1:19:33.935 --> 1:19:35.019
Wan. . .

1:19:36.188 --> 1:19:38.522
-. . . I shall tell you who she is.
-Your Majesty!

1:19:40.108 --> 1:19:42.526
-She is the woman in the portrait.
-Empress!

1:19:43.236 --> 1:19:46.030
Your father's first wife. . .

1:19:46.907 --> 1:19:48.407
. . .your birth mother.

1:19:52.037 --> 1:19:53.412
Father. . .

1:19:55.081 --> 1:19:56.540
. . . is this true?

1:20:02.297 --> 1:20:03.672
Yes.

1:20:07.177 --> 1:20:08.594
It is true.

1:20:14.226 --> 1:20:16.644
Now are you satisfied?

1:20:16.853 --> 1:20:17.895
Yes.

1:20:18.647 --> 1:20:20.564
I wanted him to know. . .

1:20:20.732 --> 1:20:22.900
. . .what kind of a person his father is.

1:20:23.068 --> 1:20:26.237
Didn't you say she died
a long time ago?

1:20:52.973 --> 1:20:56.183
Chan !

1:21:00.814 --> 1:21:02.481
Mother. . .

1:21:03.441 --> 1:21:06.485
. . .why did you have to tell us?

1:21:23.461 --> 1:21:28.841
Chan !

1:23:25.250 --> 1:23:26.875
What else is there up your sleeve?

1:23:27.168 --> 1:23:28.460
You will find out soon.

1:23:32.465 --> 1:23:35.718
-Yu !
-Mother, this is now out of your hands!

1:23:37.345 --> 1:23:39.930
Your shameful incestuous affair,
you think I don't know?

1:23:40.098 --> 1:23:42.433
You think I am still a child?

1:23:42.851 --> 1:23:45.728
I know what you and Jai
have been planning.

1:23:46.187 --> 1:23:47.730
I am acting first!

1:23:49.607 --> 1:23:53.944
Wan !

1:23:56.322 --> 1:23:58.449
-Have you gone mad?
-I am not mad !

1:23:58.950 --> 1:24:02.119
Abdicate immediately
and offer me the throne!

1:24:02.912 --> 1:24:05.539
I know you have never liked me.

1:24:06.082 --> 1:24:08.000
Who has ever cared about me?

1:24:08.418 --> 1:24:10.878
Who has ever thought about me?

1:24:11.254 --> 1:24:13.172
He is your older brother!

1:24:13.965 --> 1:24:15.257
And I want to kill him !

1:24:16.968 --> 1:24:18.093
I hate him !

1:24:18.470 --> 1:24:20.012
I hate you all !

1:25:17.195 --> 1:25:19.947
I am so sorry.

1:28:03.361 --> 1:28:05.988
Attack!

1:29:24.442 --> 1:29:25.859
Halt!

1:30:08.694 --> 1:30:12.114
Attack!

1:31:19.724 --> 1:31:21.349
Throw!

1:31:24.353 --> 1:31:34.446
Shields up!

1:31:37.575 --> 1:31:42.996
Forward !

1:31:57.386 --> 1:32:00.138
Attack!

1:32:15.029 --> 1:32:21.576
Do not harm Prince Jai !

1:33:20.886 --> 1:33:22.304
Throw!

1:33:23.889 --> 1:33:26.099
Catch !

1:33:28.853 --> 1:33:30.145
Ready!

1:33:30.313 --> 1:33:39.362
Ready! Ready!

1:33:39.614 --> 1:33:41.698
Shoot!

1:34:10.019 --> 1:34:12.854
Hold the gates!

1:36:24.111 --> 1:36:26.988
Take him alive!

1:38:47.296 --> 1:38:49.297
Kneel !

1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:57.972
Rise!

1:39:02.269 --> 1:39:04.228
You took the life of my favorite son.

1:39:06.899 --> 1:39:08.942
He told me everything. . .

1:39:09.568 --> 1:39:12.820
-. . .about your pitiful coup.
-I thought he would.

1:39:21.622 --> 1:39:24.916
You are truly insane.

1:40:16.635 --> 1:40:18.302
Execute!

1:42:44.741 --> 1:42:46.617
I had a plan.

1:42:47.119 --> 1:42:48.953
After the Chrysanthemum Festival. . .

1:42:49.121 --> 1:42:51.539
. . . I was going to remove Wan
as Crown Prince. . .

1:42:51.748 --> 1:42:54.458
. . .and appoint you as my heir.

1:42:56.837 --> 1:42:58.254
I had told you before. . .

1:42:58.463 --> 1:43:00.756
. . .what I do not give you. . .

1:43:01.133 --> 1:43:03.593
. . .you must never take by force.

1:43:06.388 --> 1:43:07.597
The Imperial Flag. . .

1:43:07.931 --> 1:43:11.350
. . .was a final warning to you.

1:43:12.686 --> 1:43:13.936
I always knew. . .

1:43:14.646 --> 1:43:17.690
. . .that this was not a battle
I could have won.

1:43:18.025 --> 1:43:19.859
Kill me or dismember me. . .

1:43:20.152 --> 1:43:22.153
. . .you will do as you wish. . .

1:43:22.779 --> 1:43:25.448
. . . but I need you to know, Father. . .

1:43:25.616 --> 1:43:26.991
. . .that I did not rebel. . .

1:43:27.159 --> 1:43:29.493
. . .for the sake of the crown.

1:43:32.706 --> 1:43:35.875
I did it for the sake of my mother.

1:43:45.010 --> 1:43:47.303
Heaven, earth, and man unite.

1:43:47.638 --> 1:43:49.513
Fortune and prosperity to all.

1:43:50.057 --> 1:43:52.475
Midnight, the Hour of the Rat.

1:43:52.893 --> 1:43:54.727
The Chrysanthemum Festival begins.

1:45:24.568 --> 1:45:26.319
Your servant kneels
before the Empress.

1:45:26.486 --> 1:45:28.696
Your Majesty's medicine
for the hour is ready.

1:45:35.746 --> 1:45:37.496
What is the punishment. . .

1:45:38.749 --> 1:45:40.374
. . .for a prince in rebellion?

1:45:41.418 --> 1:45:44.045
Your Majesty,
to be torn apart by five horses.

1:45:45.339 --> 1:45:46.422
Jai.

1:45:47.716 --> 1:45:49.133
Father. . .

1:45:50.093 --> 1:45:51.761
. . . is prepared to spare you. . .

1:45:52.971 --> 1:45:54.930
. . . if you agree to one thing.

1:45:56.975 --> 1:45:58.726
From now on. . .

1:46:00.395 --> 1:46:01.812
. . .every day. . .

1:46:02.814 --> 1:46:06.525
. . .you will personally serve
your mother's medicine.

1:47:05.293 --> 1:47:06.544
Mother. . .

1:47:07.379 --> 1:47:10.089
. . .your son has failed you.

1:47:10.382 --> 1:47:12.299
Please forgive me.

1:49:32.857 --> 1:49:35.568
Your tears

1:49:36.361 --> 1:49:39.446
Glisten, laced with pain

1:49:39.781 --> 1:49:42.992
The crescent moon
Hangs in the past

1:49:43.368 --> 1:49:46.203
Pale with sickness

1:49:46.746 --> 1:49:49.790
Cool night, too long

1:49:50.250 --> 1:49:53.043
Turns to frost

1:49:53.420 --> 1:49:56.463
Who is on the tower

1:49:56.673 --> 1:49:59.758
Frozen in despair?

1:50:00.885 --> 1:50:03.971
The rain drums lightly

1:50:04.264 --> 1:50:07.349
On a crimson pane

1:50:07.892 --> 1:50:10.936
My destiny is written on paper

1:50:11.313 --> 1:50:14.398
Fluttering in the wind

1:50:14.816 --> 1:50:17.860
Distant dreams

1:50:18.028 --> 1:50:21.113
Rise like incense

1:50:21.615 --> 1:50:23.949
Melting into night

1:50:24.117 --> 1:50:27.202
ls your image

1:50:31.291 --> 1:50:34.376
Chrysanthemums fall
Weeping to the ground

1:50:34.544 --> 1:50:38.672
Traces of your smile
On a yellowing scroll

1:50:39.215 --> 1:50:41.342
Your heart now empty

1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:44.845
My thoughts quietly rest

1:50:45.305 --> 1:50:48.641
The north wind blows
Not yet dawn

1:50:48.808 --> 1:50:52.728
Your shadow clear and close

1:50:53.063 --> 1:50:55.564
Only companion of my soul

1:50:55.732 --> 1:51:01.612
On the lake, a couple mirrored

1:51:28.181 --> 1:51:31.266
Blossoms of evening air

1:51:31.559 --> 1:51:34.186
Beauty undimmed

1:51:35.146 --> 1:51:38.190
Scatter everywhere

1:51:38.566 --> 1:51:41.652
A fate hard to swallow

1:51:41.945 --> 1:51:44.988
Sadness, do not cross the river

1:51:45.448 --> 1:51:48.492
Your autumn heart will sink

1:51:48.827 --> 1:51:51.370
Drowning in longing

1:51:51.705 --> 1:51:55.290
You will not reach the other shore

1:51:55.875 --> 1:51:58.669
Whose hills and rivers

1:51:59.587 --> 1:52:02.673
Echo with the clamor of hooves?

1:52:03.091 --> 1:52:06.093
My armor is shredded

1:52:06.469 --> 1:52:09.555
By the dividing hour

1:52:09.973 --> 1:52:13.016
The sky slowly brightens

1:52:13.476 --> 1:52:16.019
Your sighs, silk soft

1:52:17.188 --> 1:52:19.273
Weave a night of sorrow

1:52:19.441 --> 1:52:23.110
So fragile, so spare

1:52:26.614 --> 1:52:29.825
Chrysanthemums fall
Weeping to the ground

1:52:29.993 --> 1:52:34.037
Traces of your smile
On a yellowing scroll

1:52:34.372 --> 1:52:36.749
Your heart now empty

1:52:37.125 --> 1:52:40.210
My thoughts quietly rest

1:52:40.503 --> 1:52:43.672
The north wind blows
Almost dawn

1:52:43.840 --> 1:52:47.843
Your shadow, clear and close

1:52:48.344 --> 1:52:50.804
Only companion of my soul

1:52:51.014 --> 1:52:56.894
On the lake, a couple reflected

1:52:57.896 --> 1:53:01.064
Chrysanthemums sigh
ln the cool night air

1:53:01.232 --> 1:53:05.152
Traces of your smile
ln yellowing despair

1:53:05.653 --> 1:53:07.988
Your heart now empty

1:53:08.406 --> 1:53:11.450
My thoughts quietly rest

1:53:11.951 --> 1:53:15.120
The north wind blows
Almost dawn

1:53:15.288 --> 1:53:20.751
Your shadow, so close

1:53:21.461 --> 1:53:23.879
The only companion of my soul
