00:04.500 --> 00:07.100
[Clears Throat]

00:07.000 --> 00:09.300
All right. They didn't
even check our fake I.D.'s.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.600
And I wasted a whole day
thinking up my fake name.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.400
Yeah. Sorry, "Pez."

00:18.600 --> 00:21.400
Let's drink.

00:21.300 --> 00:25.000
- So, fellas, school let out early?
- Yeah. We're just-

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
- Kelso, shut up.
- Uh, I mean, no.

00:27.900 --> 00:30.800
No, we're old.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.800
We're workers.
We're all construction workers.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.800
Hey, fellas, did you
see that brick today?

00:36.700 --> 00:39.900
- Whoo!
- Relax, guys.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.300
It's "Serve a Minor Night" at the old
"Don't Have a Liquor License" Saloon.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.100
You look familiar.
Do I know you?

00:47.100 --> 00:50.100
I should hope so... Dad.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.600
Hangin'out

00:58.500 --> 01:02.200
Down the street

01:02.100 --> 01:05.800
The same old thing

01:05.800 --> 01:08.900
We did last week

01:08.800 --> 01:12.600
Not a thing to do

01:12.600 --> 01:15.900
But talk to you

01:15.800 --> 01:18.200
We're all all right

01:18.100 --> 01:20.100
We're all all right

01:20.200 --> 01:23.500
Hello, Wisconsin.!

01:28.500 --> 01:32.800
- [Laughs] Hey! Steven!
- [Laughs] Wow!

01:32.700 --> 01:36.200
- So you're Hyde's Dad?
- [Chuckles] Well, that's what his mother says.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.300
[Laughs]
Kidding.

01:38.300 --> 01:42.900
Hello, Mr. Hyde's Dad.
I am Pez.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.000
- I've heard much about you.
- Good things, I hope.

01:44.900 --> 01:49.400
Well, if running out on your family
and becoming a drunk is good, then, yes.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.900
Okay, guys.
Let's... look over here.

02:00.500 --> 02:04.200
Wow! [Chuckles]
Look at you!

02:04.100 --> 02:08.100
You're... bigger-

02:08.100 --> 02:11.000
and you got
your mom's hair...

02:10.900 --> 02:13.000
and her sideburns.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.900
- So, how long has it been?
- Eight years, 51 days.

02:18.900 --> 02:22.200
Wow! [Laughs]
Time really flies when you're-

02:22.100 --> 02:24.600
- Drunk?
- Y-Well.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.200
I was gonna say "havin' fun,"
but- [Laughs] same thing.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.100
Yeah, so, uh, how long
you been back for?

02:31.000 --> 02:34.500
Well, let's see.
Ah, that must be about a year.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.900
- Ayear?
- Yeah! Hey, I was gonna call ya.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.100
Oh, you were gonna call me?
Oh, man, that makes you, like...

02:40.100 --> 02:42.400
I don't know, what,
father of the year?

02:43.500 --> 02:46.000
I'll see you around, Dad.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.000
Oh, man, Hyde's upset.
Better go see how he is.

02:50.900 --> 02:54.000
Yep. One more round,
we'll go see how he is.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.600
Hello!
[Chuckles]

03:03.700 --> 03:07.200
She is just my type: Naked.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.200
I, too, like the naked ladies.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.000
I find them so... naked.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.400
Yeah, that's realistic.
I think I'm gonna change the oil in my car-

03:19.200 --> 03:23.600
but first I'm gonna take off everything
but my cowboy boots.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.100
Sure, I mean if you're in bare feet,
you could slip in the oil.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.000
Come on, Donna.
Safety first.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.900
Whoa! Surefire ways
to pick up women.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.700
[Scoffs] What kind of lonely losers
read this stuff anyway?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.900
Gimme.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.300
"Look deep into her eyes,
and use her name often...

03:45.100 --> 03:49.200
showing that this conversation
is just for her."

03:49.200 --> 03:52.500
[Clears Throat]
Hey, Donna.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.000
I think they're onto something, Donna.
What do you think, Donna?

03:56.000 --> 04:00.700
Oh, my God. I'm taking off my shirt.
Stop it, hands! Stop it!

04:07.100 --> 04:11.200
Well, Steven, honey,
you haven't touched your sandwich.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.100
- You feel okay?
- Yeah. I'm just not hungry.

04:14.100 --> 04:19.000
Oh, Steven. Are you finally
tired of freeloading?

04:18.899 --> 04:21.500
- Can it, Laurie.
- All I'm saying is Daddy works really hard...

04:21.500 --> 04:23.500
and nothing here is cheap.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.800
- Except you.
- [Hyde Laughing]

04:30.400 --> 04:34.900
- Believe me. I'm not cheap.
- Fine. "Free." Whatever.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.700
Hey, honey,
I'm home!

04:38.600 --> 04:42.600
Oh, good.
The hippie's here.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.200
Hyde, man, your dad
come by lookin' for you, man.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.700
Which is really freaky 'cause I thought
this bald dude was your dad.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.600
Thanks, Leo.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.600
Steven's father is in town?

05:00.500 --> 05:03.500
Yeah, right. Like he
even knows who his father is.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.800
- Eric, you know something about this?
- She's a bitch.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.700
Right. Okay.
Uh, yeah.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.800
We bumped into Hyde's dad
last night.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.600
He'd been back in town, like, a year-
hadn't even talked to his own son.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.900
Cool. Egg salad.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.900
Well, I'm gonna
talk to Steven...

05:25.900 --> 05:28.000
and see how he's
feeling about this.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.800
You know what, Mom? I wouldn't do that.
Hyde likes to bottle those things up.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.500
Good for him. That's where
those feelings should be kept.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.200
Well, what is he gonna do?
Pretend he doesn't have a father?

05:39.100 --> 05:44.100
Kitty, this is a family issue, and,
for once, it's not about our family.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.800
Look, the bond between
a father and a son...

05:47.700 --> 05:50.500
is complex and subtle.

05:50.400 --> 05:54.200
You wipe that damn smirk
off your face!

05:56.500 --> 05:58.500
Red, when we took
that boy into our home...

05:58.500 --> 06:01.500
it became our job to see him
through thick and thin...

06:01.400 --> 06:04.800
and now it's thick-

06:04.800 --> 06:08.400
or thin- I don't know,
but he needs us.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.300
Cool egg salad, man.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.800
Fine. Stick your nose in
where it doesn't belong. Go ahead.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.900
Okay. Will do.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.100
Bud's comin' over
for drinks tonight.

06:18.100 --> 06:22.100
Uh, Mom, do you really want to invite
an alcoholic over for cocktails?

06:21.900 --> 06:25.200
Oh, right. Okay, well,
I'll just, um...

06:25.200 --> 06:27.900
I'll make him a nice
Shirley Temple...

06:27.900 --> 06:29.900
and he can fill up on cheese.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.074

06:43.800 --> 06:46.200
You keep a stack of dirty magazines
under your bed?

06:46.100 --> 06:49.300
What? No!
God, not a stack.

06:52.400 --> 06:56.300
You know, what is
a "stack" really?

06:56.200 --> 06:59.200
- Why do you have these down here?
- Now, wait, Donna...

06:59.200 --> 07:02.200
downstairs you were laughing
and cracking jokes about this stuff.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.400
Eric, that was
in the basement...

07:04.400 --> 07:06.800
with our idiotic friends.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.500
- Why do you need them? Aren't I enough?
- No-Yeah, you're enough.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.800
God, you're-
you're plenty.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.800
It's just, uh,
that, uh...

07:15.700 --> 07:19.200
you see, Donna, you see,
what I do with dirty magazines...

07:19.100 --> 07:21.800
is...

07:21.800 --> 07:23.800
really only interesting to me-

07:25.600 --> 07:29.300
with the reading of the articles
and the solving of the puzzles and whatnot.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.200
You know what? I don't wanna know
about the whatnot.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.500
I'm outta here.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.900
Oh, no, girls.
She's onto us.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.900
Hello, Jackie.
How are you, Jackie?

07:44.900 --> 07:49.700
- Fine.
- I'm glad, Jackie. I, too, am fine, Jackie.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.900
Do I have a sty?

07:53.000 --> 07:57.500
No, Jackie. You, Jackie,
do not have a sty-

07:57.300 --> 08:00.600
- Jackie.
- Okay-

08:00.500 --> 08:02.500
Fez.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.800
I don't know what
you're doing, Fez...

08:04.800 --> 08:07.200
but stop doing it, Fez.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.500
Oh, no. Now I am turned on.

08:15.900 --> 08:21.400
Oh, wow, man. Look at all these different nuts
intermingling in one bowl.

08:22.100 --> 08:25.200
It's like "Nutstock," man.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.100
Kitty, I think
we should rethink...

08:29.100 --> 08:32.200
our "Don't Throw Leo
Out On His Ass" policy.

08:34.400 --> 08:40.400
No, no. Leo stuck around
because he cares about Steven.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.100
And, plus, I can't
find my shoes, man.

08:43.100 --> 08:46.800
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- Oh, good news, Steven.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.700
- Your dad's coming over tonight.
- Screw that!

08:49.700 --> 08:52.100
- No, Steven, it's a good thing, I think.
- [Doorbell Rings]

08:52.000 --> 08:55.100
- I got nothing to say to him!
- Well, we have fancy nut mix.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.000
Hey, Red!
Remember me?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.700
Of course. I wasn't the one
passed out in the gutter.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.900
[Laughs]
Yeah, I have this weird condition...

09:05.900 --> 09:07.900
where I drink a case
of beer and fall down.

09:07.900 --> 09:12.900
[Laughs]
Hey, Red. Man, you're lookin' good.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.900
Have you lost, um... hair?

09:15.900 --> 09:19.000
Steven'll be right out.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.900
Hey, man, nice shoes.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.300
Are those mine?

09:24.600 --> 09:26.700
- Hello, Bud.
- Hi.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.900
- Can I go now?
- It's "May I go" and no.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.900
So, Bud...

09:31.900 --> 09:34.800
can I get you a drink?

09:34.700 --> 09:38.400
[Forced Laugh]

09:38.400 --> 09:40.900
A drink! A drink of soda.

09:40.800 --> 09:46.100
A nice drink of soda,
Bud. Plus, we have cheese.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.900
Soda sounds great, Kitty.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
- Yeah, I'm off the hooch.
- [Kitty] Oh, really?

09:50.900 --> 09:56.200
- So, no more boozing?
- I heard him.

09:56.100 --> 09:59.900
Yep. I can finally
see clearly.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.100
Isn't it great, man?

10:04.300 --> 10:07.700
It is. I got a job
and an apartment.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.400
- Color TV.
- Ooh, color TV. That's nice.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.300
Wow, Bud, you're doing
great now, huh?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.400
Color TV? Man.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.100
I remember when I was a kid,
I didn't even have a father.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.200
[Smacks Lips]
Well, well.

10:26.200 --> 10:30.400
- Who could have foreseen this terrible-
- Can it.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.300
Jackie didn't give me
the time of the day.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.300
I hate this stupid magazine.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.300
Oh, no. I didn't mean it.
I love you.

10:46.300 --> 10:49.300
[Chuckles]
Hey, Fez. Check this out.

10:49.300 --> 10:53.400
"Tight pants turn a man's derriere
into a lady's dream...

10:53.200 --> 10:55.700
"and an open shirt
shows a sexy chest...

10:55.700 --> 10:59.100
and an irresistible
joie de vivre."

11:00.800 --> 11:03.400
Really?

11:03.400 --> 11:05.600
I always thought
my joie de vivre was in my pants.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.300
Okay. I can't believe
I'm asking you guys this...

11:11.300 --> 11:13.600
but if any of you losers
had a girlfriend...

11:13.600 --> 11:16.100
would you still
look at those magazines?

11:16.100 --> 11:21.800
Hey, I had two girlfriends-
and a little action on the side-

11:21.700 --> 11:24.200
and I still looked
at those magazines.

11:24.100 --> 11:28.200
You had action on the side? Who?

11:28.100 --> 11:30.300
You don't know her.
She went to Sacred Heart.

11:30.300 --> 11:34.700
Okay. Anybody here
have an opinion who's not a skeevy pig?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.200
I'm glad you asked, Donna.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.200
If I had Jackie, I would never
look at those magazines-

11:42.100 --> 11:46.600
Unless she's on the phone
or went shopping...

11:46.500 --> 11:49.300
or took a short nap.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
[Sighs]
Look, Donna...

11:52.400 --> 11:54.700
this is just the way
guys are. Okay?

11:54.700 --> 11:59.800
I mean if Forman was actually dating the-
the "Naughty Campus Coeds"...

11:59.700 --> 12:02.600
he'd be locked in a bathroom
looking at naked pictures of you.

12:03.900 --> 12:07.400
He's right, so-
Are there naked pictures of you?

12:08.900 --> 12:10.900
[Groans]
My leg!

12:10.900 --> 12:13.300
- Hey, knee him in the groin!
- [Kelso] Oh.!

12:13.300 --> 12:15.500
Oh, my, God!
She did it!

12:18.800 --> 12:21.300
[Kelso Groans]

12:25.500 --> 12:27.800
So...

12:27.800 --> 12:30.000
how's your cocoa?

12:29.900 --> 12:32.500
Chocolaty good. Thanks.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.500
That's good 'cause I think
your father has really changed.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.700
He is not the same man
I used to know...

12:37.700 --> 12:39.900
and the marshmallows
make it extra good.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.200
Well, at least you knew him,
Mrs. Forman, 'cause I never did.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.100
Okay, well,
here's your chance.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.300
Maybe now you can make
some new, happy memories.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.300
Wouldn't that
be wonderful?

12:57.300 --> 13:01.100
- [Engine Starts]
- [Hyde Cheering]

13:02.200 --> 13:04.000
Yeah!

13:09.700 --> 13:13.200
[Groans]

13:17.800 --> 13:20.100
[No Audible Dialogue]

13:21.200 --> 13:24.200
[Screaming]

13:24.100 --> 13:28.400
[Sobbing]

13:32.500 --> 13:34.600
[Sobs]

13:42.500 --> 13:44.900
Yeah, you know what,
Mrs. Forman?

13:44.800 --> 13:47.700
No.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.900
Are you sure? 'Cause I kinda think
you're bottling things up.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.000
I'm not bottling anything!

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
[Sighs]

14:05.100 --> 14:08.100
Well, hi, there, beautiful.
And how are you?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.800
Not good, you dirtbag.

14:10.700 --> 14:14.100
That's what I thought you'd-
Excuse me.

14:14.100 --> 14:18.700
I am not going to help you cheat
on your girlfriend.

14:18.600 --> 14:23.400
But I don't have
a girlfriend, you...

14:23.300 --> 14:25.800
silly librarian.

14:25.800 --> 14:30.800
Don't you lie to me. I heard everything.
I was right under that mattress...

14:30.700 --> 14:32.900
and that Donna
sounded really upset.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.600
No! No, no.
Sh-She's okay. Really.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
Excuse me.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.000
My turnoffs include
unfaithful men.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.000
Didn't you read
my biography?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.400
Um-

14:45.400 --> 14:48.200
l-You know,
I was just getting to it.

14:49.100 --> 14:54.600
Sorry, but Donna
is a nice girl...

14:54.400 --> 14:58.000
and you are a...
filthy, filthy boy!

14:58.000 --> 15:02.700
You filthy, filthy,
filthy, filthy...

15:02.500 --> 15:06.800
filthy, filthy, filthy,
filthy, filthy, filthy boy!

15:13.300 --> 15:17.200
Hey! You can't ditch me,
then walk back into my life eight years later...

15:17.000 --> 15:19.200
and expect everything
to be okay.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.900
- You screwed me!
- I did. You're right. I know.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.000
And-

15:24.000 --> 15:27.300
You what? You know?
What do you mean you know?

15:27.300 --> 15:29.500
[Sputters]
I got no excuse. I was a jerk.

15:29.500 --> 15:32.900
[Scoffs]
I've been a jerk my whole life.

15:32.800 --> 15:36.500
[Sighs]
And all I can do is tell you I'm sorry...

15:36.400 --> 15:38.400
and hope that you'll
believe me.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.300
You jerk! How am I supposed
to yell at you now?

15:43.200 --> 15:45.500
I was gonna yell!
I was gonna tell you off!

15:45.400 --> 15:48.000
I think you should. I mean, you wanna yell?
Go ahead.

15:47.900 --> 15:51.000
- I deserve it.
- You're ju-You're caving?

15:51.000 --> 15:55.500
That just makes it worse!
Come on, man. Give me something!

15:55.400 --> 15:59.200
- You want a beer?
- Yeah!

16:00.500 --> 16:02.900
Give me a beer!

16:10.400 --> 16:13.300
- Well, hello, Jackie.
- Hey, Fez.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.700
[Laughs]
Hey, Fez.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.100
Nice ass!

16:21.100 --> 16:23.800
Why, thank you, Kelso.

16:23.700 --> 16:26.200
Oh, my God.
What the hell's that smell?

16:26.200 --> 16:29.300
Well, Jackie,
it's a combination of musk...

16:29.300 --> 16:32.800
and a little thing
I like to call "Fez."

16:32.700 --> 16:35.200
Whoa, Fez!
What are you doing?

16:35.100 --> 16:37.100
Showing off
my joie de vivre.

16:37.100 --> 16:40.600
- You like?
- No!

16:40.500 --> 16:43.800
So, what?
This was all a waste?

16:43.700 --> 16:45.700
The pants, the chest,
the manly smell...

16:45.600 --> 16:48.000
the "Jackie, hello,
Jackie, Jackie...

16:48.000 --> 16:50.800
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie,
Jackie"-Worthless?

16:50.700 --> 16:54.000
Not worthless-
Hilarious.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.800
Okay, look, Fez,
you're not bad-looking.

16:58.700 --> 17:02.200
I mean, some girls like
that exotic, grimy look-

17:02.200 --> 17:04.700
but only the cheapest,
most sluttiest girls will like that.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.200
I see.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.099
Damn, Fez!
Looking good.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.400
Hey, so, thanks for the singles
at the nudie bar, huh.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.700
Hey, hey, hey! You gotta tip the girls
or they ignore ya.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.300
- Yeah.
- So, they takin' care of you here?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.400
Yeah, yeah.
It's good. It's great.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.800
- It's a nice place.
- Oh, yeah.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.300
That's nice.
I like my place too.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.900
It's good.
It's got an extra room.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.800
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.400
So, if you ever wanna,
you know, come by or whatever.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.400
You know? I'm not
usin' the extra room.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.400
Hence, the term
"extra room."

17:51.200 --> 17:54.500
Yeah. Yeah,
the rent's due, but...

17:54.400 --> 17:56.500
they don't evict you
for, like, three months...

17:56.400 --> 17:58.700
so, I still got... two days.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.200
So, you lookin'
for a loan, Bud?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.500
Well, will ya look at that?

18:07.400 --> 18:10.100
A father and son
brought together by-

18:10.100 --> 18:13.100
Oh, my goodness!
I think it was me!

18:15.900 --> 18:20.700
- Don't gloat, Kitty.
- Mr. Wrongie!

18:22.800 --> 18:24.800
Fine.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.200
Once in 26 years!

18:28.100 --> 18:30.900
Live it up, Kitty!

18:34.900 --> 18:38.600
Oh, crap.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.300
Ta-da

18:42.300 --> 18:46.000
Wow, Eric.
It's a room.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.600
Not just any room. See?

18:48.600 --> 18:50.900
No more dirty magazines.
I threw 'em all out.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.400
And you know what, Donna?
I don't miss 'em.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.600
Eric, you didn't
have to do that.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.800
I mean, I understand
why you need them.

18:57.700 --> 19:01.800
- You do?
- Yes! You're disgusting!

19:01.700 --> 19:03.800
- What?
- It's okay.

19:03.700 --> 19:07.000
All guys are.
You're a revolting gender.

19:06.900 --> 19:09.700
You know,
we really are.

19:09.700 --> 19:13.900
But you're disgusting
in a cute, harmless way...

19:13.800 --> 19:15.800
and I guess I love you
for that.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.400
I love you too.

19:21.200 --> 19:25.400
Let me make it up to you. I can have
a naked girl in here in 10 seconds.

19:25.300 --> 19:29.600
- Oh, great. Send her in. I'll see you later.
- Shut up!

19:33.200 --> 19:37.700
Steven, good. I wanted
to have a talk with you.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.400
- What are you doin'?
- Oh.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.200
- I'm movin' in with Bud.
- You're movin' in with Bud?

19:43.200 --> 19:47.100
- Yeah, Red. It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.400
Steven, your dad is not...

19:50.300 --> 19:53.700
good.

19:53.700 --> 19:57.700
Yeah. I know, but,
you know, he's my dad.

19:59.900 --> 20:02.600
- Yeah. He's your dad.
- Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.400
Anyway. Red, thanks for everything.
You know? Really.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.600
Hey, do me a favor.
Would you tell Mrs. Forman?

20:10.600 --> 20:14.500
- I don't want to have to deal
with the whole crying thing.
- You think I do?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.800
Nah, I'll just tell her
that, you know-

20:16.800 --> 20:19.100
Anytime you need a place to stay,
you're welcome here.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.600
- That'll make her feel better.
- Yeah. That sounds good.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.800
Thanks.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.800
[Clears Throat] Yeah, so, what?
You don't wanna hug, do ya?

20:26.800 --> 20:29.900
- [Chuckles] God, no.
- Good.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.300
- 'Cause you're not gettin' one.
- Right.

20:45.300 --> 20:49.000
- Well, sis-boom-bah.
- Sure this is okay?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.500
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Before you got here...

20:51.500 --> 20:54.500
I got the thumbs-up
from the old ball and chain.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.300
- She's great. You'd like her.
- Oh.

20:57.100 --> 21:00.800
Well, if she's so great,
are you sure you need me?

21:00.700 --> 21:04.900
Look, I've been over this
again and again and again-

21:04.800 --> 21:07.000
And, yes, I do.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.300
Okay.

21:09.300 --> 21:12.000
Well, yea, team.
