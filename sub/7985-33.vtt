KERRI: Well, I want
her to still do it,

10:56.856 --> 10:58.625
but Abby doesn't want
it under her name.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.560
ASHLEE:
Well, if you compete with us,
you can change her costume

11:31.090 --> 11:33.459
Abby, my daughter
is dancing today.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.462
But she's gonna dance
in the Mother Dance Studio.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.232
Good luck.
Go see how they're...

11:40.667 --> 11:42.035

She was one of the first

11:50.577 --> 11:52.278

11:52.278 --> 11:54.080
I said that to her. I said,

You guys are not a team.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.629

missed doctor's appointments,

12:19.339 --> 12:21.541

ASHLEE:
<i>Brynn is an amazing dancer,</i>

34:28.233 --> 34:30.468
but this season
she hasn't gotten a chance

34:30.468 --> 34:32.337

of her talent at all.

34:32.337 --> 34:36.174
<i>She has got to prove to herself</i>

ASHLEE:
<i>I think that she</i>

35:04.235 --> 35:07.272
did amazing with what was
on her plate this week

35:07.272 --> 35:08.673
and I think doing

35:08.673 --> 35:11.076
<i>a solo this hard</i>
<i>in that short of time</i>

35:11.076 --> 35:12.377

there are not a lot of kids

35:13.545 --> 35:15.447

35:15.447 --> 35:18.950
ANNOUNCER:
We have teen solo.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.653
KIRA: <i>Abby's choreography never</i>

35:21.653 --> 35:23.688

full potential.

35:23.688 --> 35:25.523
<i>Kalani needs to win</i>

35:25.523 --> 35:27.726

...is number 82,
"False."

35:44.075 --> 35:45.477
(cheering and applause)

35:49.981 --> 35:52.884
And first place
in the teen solo category

35:52.884 --> 35:55.854

36:06.097 --> 36:07.599

you're dead to me.

<i>They have the talent</i>
<i>to become stars, just like</i>

36:54.012 --> 36:55.280
<i>the junior elite</i>
<i>competition team.</i>

36:55.280 --> 36:57.615
<i>The difference is</i>
<i>the minis respect me.</i>

36:57.615 --> 36:59.451
And I made the right decision

36:59.451 --> 37:01.219
<i>in not putting Peyton</i>
<i>in the number.</i>

37:01.219 --> 37:04.556
It was just too much pressure
for the child.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.191
Next we have teen group.

37:06.191 --> 37:08.126
STACEY:
<i>Abby won't admit it,</i>

37:08.126 --> 37:09.294
<i>but I'm sure that</i>

37:09.294 --> 37:11.029
she's feeling tons of pressure

37:11.029 --> 37:14.065
<i>because her reputation</i>
<i>is on the line.</i>

37:14.065 --> 37:16.401
<i>The junior elites have not</i>
<i>had a winning season.</i>

37:16.401 --> 37:18.837
<i>So if they win the whole thing,</i>

37:18.837 --> 37:20.672
it makes it look like
it was her fault

37:20.672 --> 37:22.273
that they weren't doing well.

37:22.273 --> 37:23.241
Third place...

HOLLY:
<i>I'm just floored that</i>

37:39.591 --> 37:41.259
<i>the group dance didn't win.</i>

37:41.259 --> 37:43.394
I cannot believe this
is actually occurring.

37:43.394 --> 37:46.364
<i>But I'm really proud</i>

37:46.364 --> 37:48.500
<i>of what our girls</i>

37:48.500 --> 37:49.534
<i>They're resilient.</i>

37:49.534 --> 37:52.303
<i>They should be proud.</i>

37:54.572 --> 37:57.575
So, do you enjoy, like,
clapping really loud when

37:57.575 --> 38:02.247
somebody beats Kalani?

38:02.247 --> 38:04.115
You think that's
good behavior of a teacher?

38:04.115 --> 38:05.884
I didn't want to
say anything, but...

38:05.884 --> 38:08.453
I'd rather speak
when she's present.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.255
I don't think you need to speak
to her at this point.

38:10.255 --> 38:11.656
Your behavior

38:11.656 --> 38:13.691
of clapping that loud

38:13.691 --> 38:16.961
at someone beating Kalani
is disgusting.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.997
I was thrilled that kid won.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.799
KIRA:
That's number one reason,

38:20.799 --> 38:22.433
um, I didn't hate you before

38:22.433 --> 38:25.036
but I absolutely
do hate you now.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.504
How about

38:26.504 --> 38:28.306
let's name ten reasons

38:28.306 --> 38:32.811
why Abby Lee Miller
is a rude, mean, ugly woman.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.145
HOLLY:
Reason number nine

38:34.145 --> 38:35.780
would be, Abby,

38:35.780 --> 38:37.849
that you want minis

38:37.849 --> 38:41.452
to be at a higher level
than your teen group.

38:41.452 --> 38:42.520
That's like a principal saying,

38:42.520 --> 38:43.788
"I want my elementary kids

38:43.788 --> 38:44.889
to beat my seniors."

38:44.889 --> 38:47.458
Is that what you're afraid of?

38:47.458 --> 38:49.194
That they're beating you?

38:49.194 --> 38:51.062
The teens should not be
being beat by the minis

38:51.062 --> 38:53.031
and we're being set up every
week for the minis to beat us.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.900
HOLLY:
So, that would be number nine.
Number eight,

38:55.900 --> 38:59.003
the lies that you told
last week.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.773
Adding two boys until Abby
tells me it's okay.

39:01.773 --> 39:02.974
I cannot do it.
JILL:
Okay.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.642
She will not tell me it's okay.
Okay.

39:04.642 --> 39:05.910
So, they cannot dance.

39:05.910 --> 39:08.079
That's not what I said.
Sir, sir,

39:08.079 --> 39:10.682
didn't I tell you
to let them dance?
Uh, no, you did not.

39:10.682 --> 39:14.285
ABBY LEE:
You have no morsel of respect

39:14.285 --> 39:17.989
or dignity for those
two other little girls.

39:17.989 --> 39:20.658
Abby, you made them come!

39:20.658 --> 39:21.659
You did!

39:21.659 --> 39:23.595
You did that to them!

39:23.595 --> 39:25.864
And you made them dance
and the little girl

39:25.864 --> 39:27.465
wouldn't learn it.
It was a dance that she knew,

39:27.465 --> 39:29.334
that she practiced...

39:29.334 --> 39:30.869
JILL:
<i>I think Abby's lost her mind.</i>

39:30.869 --> 39:32.103
This is her fault.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.905
I really just don't give a damn.
Who cares?

39:33.905 --> 39:35.273
JILL:
<i>We stuck by her side</i>

39:35.273 --> 39:36.574
<i>time and time and time again</i>

39:36.574 --> 39:38.710
<i>only to have Abby</i>

39:38.710 --> 39:41.079
<i>continually berate our kids.</i>

39:41.079 --> 39:42.447
Dip (bleep)!
Why didn't she call it?

39:42.447 --> 39:44.482
Don't call me a dip (bleep)
You're the dip (bleep)

39:44.482 --> 39:46.417
JILL: <i>I thought today</i>
<i>would change Abby</i>

39:46.417 --> 39:49.287
<i>and make her see</i>
<i>her wrongdoings.</i>

39:49.287 --> 39:52.156
<i>But she's just</i>
<i>a vicious human being.</i>

39:52.156 --> 39:53.958
ABBY LEE:
It was bull!

39:53.958 --> 39:55.727
HOLLY: She justifies...
(moms clamoring)

39:55.727 --> 39:57.996
Let's go, ladies.
It's time to go.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.631
KIRA: And that's why
you're the last one standing.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.099
HOLLY:
Yeah, last one standing.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.234
Enjoy being alone.
JILL:
Enjoy the loneliness, Abby.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.136
You're dead to us.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.137
<i>You know what?</i>

40:06.137 --> 40:08.773
Maybe we do hate Abby.

40:08.773 --> 40:11.409
But if we do, it's because
she made us hate her.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.578
<i>I don't know where we're going.</i>

40:13.578 --> 40:15.480
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>we're gonna do,</i>

40:15.480 --> 40:16.814
but we're gonna make it work,

40:16.814 --> 40:18.883
and it won't be at the ALDC L. A.

40:18.883 --> 40:20.151
Nope.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.754
That woman is a beast.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.355
I think she has lost her mind.

40:24.355 --> 40:26.057
Normal people don't
behave that way.

40:26.057 --> 40:29.093
Well, jail is gonna
treat her right.

40:32.530 --> 40:35.900
Karma's a bitch.

ABBY LEE:

40:37.001 --> 40:38.770
We've had eight weeks off.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.705

40:40.705 --> 40:42.440

your studio or not?

40:44.042 --> 40:45.677

40:45.677 --> 40:47.845
