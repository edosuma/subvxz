-No.

it was comforting, you know?

Although I knew he was
trying to tell me something.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.594

understood what it was.

was when he stopped
appearing altogether.

Well, I can't stand you being
in a mood with me today.

36:22.682 --> 36:25.977
I'm not in a mood with you.
You can do what
you like, okay?

36:27.187 --> 36:29.773
Where did you
get that ring from?

36:30.523 --> 36:32.942
Listen, Reeta's a mess.

36:33.026 --> 36:36.780

about postponing
the wedding but...

(SIGHS)

36:39.032 --> 36:41.868
Did you just see something
before I walked in?

36:44.662 --> 36:47.332
What happened?
What happened to the ghost?

36:47.415 --> 36:50.251
I think she died
of a broken heart.

36:50.335 --> 36:51.711
She didn't get
a chance to marry,

36:51.795 --> 36:54.339
she didn't get a chance
to leave this place.

36:54.422 --> 36:57.342
Max,
we can't have another Cass,
we have to stop this wedding.

36:57.425 --> 37:00.929
So, what? You think the ghost
is angry because Reeta's
getting hitched?

37:01.012 --> 37:03.515
No, the ghost thinks
that Reeta's disrespecting

37:03.598 --> 37:05.308
the institution of marriage.

37:05.392 --> 37:08.269
-What do you mean?
-She slept with someone else.

37:08.353 --> 37:11.189
-Forsaking all others,
remember?
-Well, who did she sleep with?

37:11.272 --> 37:12.941
Well, she didn't
really want to tell me

37:13.024 --> 37:16.069
but I think
it's someone
from this building.

37:16.569 --> 37:18.363
Hey.

37:18.446 --> 37:20.907
Mate,
we need to get a move on.
The bar needs setting up.

37:20.990 --> 37:22.826

be arriving soon.

Reeta and Ed's
big day, are we?

37:25.328 --> 37:27.580

before I begin, as formality

-Bloody hell,
it's freezing in here.
-Max, we have to do something.

any reason why
these two people
