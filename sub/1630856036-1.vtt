WEBVTT

00:18.810 --> 00:20.604
I'll grab that. Thank you.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.568
Excuse me.

00:28.820 --> 00:29.821
Sorry.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.448
Excuse me.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.927
Mother, why are you sneaking around?

00:51.927 --> 00:53.971
It's starting soon, and he's not here.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.849
Nan, Lord Richard's not here.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.225
It's fine. Go downstairs.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.810
Well, how can it ever be fine?

00:59.810 --> 01:02.729
- Is Conchita dressed?
- Yes, quite dressed. Go downstairs.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.572
<i>I was never supposed to be
the main character.</i>

01:12.614 --> 01:13.532
<i>Always more than glad</i>

01:13.532 --> 01:15.409
- <i>to let Jinny, my sister...</i>
- He'll come.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.202
<i>...and my friends compete for all of that.</i>

01:17.202 --> 01:18.620
Because I know he'll come.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.127
<i>Girls are taught to believe
that if a story isn't a love story,</i>

01:26.170 --> 01:27.254
<i>it's a tragedy.</i>

01:29.381 --> 01:31.466
- <i>And I had no interest at all...</i>
- What if he doesn't?

01:31.466 --> 01:33.552
<i>...in being involved
with either one of those.</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:38.682
<i>The whole world knew
that my best friend's was a love story.</i>

01:39.391 --> 01:42.519
<i>A whirlwind romance
with a handsome English lord</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:45.147
<i>can only be followed
by a huge society wedding,</i>

01:46.231 --> 01:47.608
<i>to make entirely certain</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:50.944
<i>anyone not envious of Conchita yet,
soon would be.</i>

01:52.571 --> 01:56.283
<i>But nobody's jealous of a bride
whose groom has failed to show.</i>

01:57.701 --> 01:58.619
Anything?

01:59.786 --> 02:03.624
- Nothing. And downstairs?
- Well, the guests have barely noticed.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.584
- Conchie, he will come.
- But today was supposed to be

02:05.584 --> 02:08.503
the most beautiful day--
And the whole world is here.

02:08.503 --> 02:12.007
Gosh, I hate him. You have no idea
how much I loathe him.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.091
God.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.596
Of course, I love him.
I know I love him. I love him.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.640
I just-- I should have known.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.975
Last night
he just seemed so much further away.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.602
Richard's never further away

02:23.602 --> 02:26.021
- than just right here.
- Oh, Nan.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.943
I should have told him, shouldn't I?

02:31.902 --> 02:35.364
But I don't want him to marry me
because he has to,

02:35.364 --> 02:37.491
I want him to marry me
because he adores me.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.825
Yes.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.160
I'm ruined.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.382
Where is he?

02:54.591 --> 02:56.802
- Most of the guests are already on their--
- It'll be fine.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.639
What if we just started
putting on the dress,

03:00.639 --> 03:03.016
- and then he'll get here any second--
- No, Nan. I just don't know.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.777
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm gonna go get it.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.445
No, Nan, you idiot.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.073
What are you doing?

03:18.866 --> 03:21.159
Stop. What are you doing?

03:21.159 --> 03:23.954
- Nan, you're insane.
- I'll get it.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.082
- Oh, my God.
- What is she doing?

03:27.082 --> 03:28.584
That girl!

03:42.097 --> 03:44.141
I'm not escaping or anything.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.976
- No!
- I'm sorry.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.021
Are you sure you ought to--

03:50.439 --> 03:53.567
- I got it! I got it!
- Yes! Yes, Nan!

03:53.567 --> 03:55.527
Nan, you look an absolute fright.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.446
That's always what you wanna hear.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.114
Come inside! The wedding!

03:59.114 --> 04:01.116
- Yeah, my wedding.
- Yes, there's a wedding.

04:01.116 --> 04:04.286
- And nobody likes to talk about it.
- Come in and clean yourself up!

04:04.286 --> 04:06.079
- For the wedding.
- You heard about that.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.915
Apparently you can't be too clean
for a wedding.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.666
- Yeah.
- What a fuss everyone makes.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.918
Do you want to get married?

04:11.835 --> 04:13.545
No-- I'm not-- I didn't-- That wasn't--

04:13.545 --> 04:15.422
That wasn't a proposal.

04:15.422 --> 04:20.928
- Nan. Come on, Nan. I need you. Let's go.
- Annabel, do stop causing a commotion.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.679
Tricky things, mothers.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.890
That's not my mother.
That's my governess, Miss Testvalley.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.309
- And come inside, please.
- Yes.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.936
I really do need to...

04:31.813 --> 04:34.942
Oh, Nan, look! He's here.
It's Dick's carriage.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.069
Of course he's here!

04:37.069 --> 04:39.196
- Nan, come on! I need to get dressed!
- He's here!

04:39.196 --> 04:40.614
I'm getting married!

04:45.285 --> 04:46.161
Nan.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.206
Listen, don't say a word.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.917
I've not slept a wink all night.
I need you to give this to Conchita.

04:51.917 --> 04:55.462
No. And I don't believe
you want her to have it either.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.130
There's not an ounce of bad in Conchita.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.550
No, of course not,
but it's only my parents.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.385
Don't say parents.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.929
They wouldn't want to come, of course.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.639
I'm nothing but trouble
at the best of times.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.516
Well, hasn't this summer been
the best of times?

05:07.516 --> 05:08.642
- With Conchita?
- Yes.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.979
I've never known times like it.
But will she work in England?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.564
Will she fit in?

05:15.065 --> 05:17.067
Conchita's not someone
that goes unnoticed.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.235
She's like the sun.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.737
- And today, it's just s--
- Today's just for show.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.573
Conchita's father is in love
with you being a lord

05:22.573 --> 05:24.992
and for all of New York to see
how much money he's made.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.785
Conchita's in love with you.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.537
Gosh.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.374
Yes. And your parents want you to do what?

05:32.374 --> 05:35.961
I don't know. Go home
and start acting sensibly, I expect.

05:35.961 --> 05:38.088
- Oh, God, Nan. She's a miracle.
- Yes.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.674
- I get drunk on her.
- Yes! It's you and Conchita.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.760
Who wants to act sensibly?
And who wants their life to go unnoticed?

05:49.141 --> 05:51.143
Where are you going?

05:51.143 --> 05:55.522
Inside to marry my beautiful...

05:58.358 --> 05:59.610
wonderful wife!

05:59.610 --> 06:00.861
Nan,

06:02.571 --> 06:05.032
you tell Conchita I love her.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.366
She already knows, you idiot.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.786
Driver, front entrance, please.
I'm getting married.

06:17.711 --> 06:22.257
You are
the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.800
Apart from Jinny.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.719
And Lizzy.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.720
And the poodle.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.890
Well, then you're in my top five.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.100
- Top five?
- No, top six, for sure.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.446
Of course you have no interest at all
in being admired.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.698
Well, I have no interest
in the man doing the admiring.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.534
I can admire myself, can't I?

06:48.534 --> 06:51.537
You're complicated. We're complicated.

06:53.997 --> 06:58.377
- It's fine, I'll pick--
- Conchita, you look so beautiful.

06:58.377 --> 06:59.878
You look amazing.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.464
Girls, here is to a new world.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.384
Marriages, men, parties.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.177
Not particularly in that order.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.346
Which comes first?

07:09.346 --> 07:12.516
Darlings, we always come first.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.976
- Always.
- Always.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.894
Shall we swear on it
in blood or champagne?

07:15.894 --> 07:18.146
- Champagne!
- Of course!

09:02.334 --> 09:03.335
Good luck.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.841
You won't forget me
when you go to England, right?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.009
Who are you again?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.460
Wow.

09:54.887 --> 09:57.347
- Be the party.
- We are the party.

10:05.022 --> 10:08.358
I need to take
these garters off. It's so scratchy.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.527
Ladies.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.531
Sorry.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.163
Meet me.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.094
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.304
I keep bumping into people on staircases.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.057
Yes. Well, it is a hazard
when you dance on them.

11:22.057 --> 11:26.019
Yeah. Well, I'm generally
a strictly walk-down-stairs man.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.020
Perhaps a little skip,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.398
if there's something at the bottom
I'm particularly pleased to see.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.573
It's the worst timing of my life,
but I've really got to go.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.993
- Where you going?
- Home. My mother's going to die.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.122
Sorry, I can't believe
I'm saying that out loud.

11:45.122 --> 11:47.207
And not that doctors always, you know...

11:49.501 --> 11:51.044
They hardly ever know anything.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.383
Anyway,
I couldn't get a boat before tonight,

11:56.383 --> 11:58.427
no matter who I begged.
But I've really gotta...

11:58.427 --> 12:01.305
You'll get home, and your mother
will be delighted to see you.

12:04.808 --> 12:05.976
If only you could come with me.

12:08.187 --> 12:10.480
I did. From there to here.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.609
Our first trip.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.654
By the way, I'm Nan. Nan St. George.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.283
Bye then, Nan St. George.

12:33.212 --> 12:36.256
We're here. We're right in it.

12:36.965 --> 12:41.094
- And it only took five years.
- Yep. Only five short years.

12:46.683 --> 12:50.479
My dear, when we were neighbors
back in little old Saratoga,

12:50.479 --> 12:51.647
who could have thought--

12:51.647 --> 12:53.982
That when we moved here,
you'd be right behind us.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.069
That unbred laugh.

12:57.069 --> 12:59.780
Sweetheart, you are here now.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.783
Enjoy.

13:05.577 --> 13:06.578
Ladies.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.541
Well, I guess over here
is the best view of the party.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.876
Look. It's Mrs. Paramore.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.128
She's here. Look at her dress.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.505
Oh, Mrs. Paramore.

13:17.089 --> 13:21.134
We were hoping to catch you in regards
to invitations to the Assembly Ball.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.305
I'm Mrs. St. George, Mrs. Paramore.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.767
And this is my Jinny.
One of the bridesmaids.

13:28.767 --> 13:32.688
- And my Lizzy.
- Oh, yes. St. George.

13:32.688 --> 13:36.066
- The family from Saratoga.
- We live in the city now.

13:36.066 --> 13:40.070
- My husband did awful well at the stock--
- Good for him. Good for all of you.

13:40.571 --> 13:41.905
Mrs. Closson,

13:41.905 --> 13:45.200
- your canapés are fit for a lord.
- Why thank you.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.743
I'm sorry, Mother, was I supposed--

13:46.743 --> 13:49.872
- No. You did just as you should.
- Mrs. St. George,

13:50.789 --> 13:54.042
I'm afraid you can't attend
a New York ball of any kind this season.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.587
- Well, I see no reason, now th--
- My mother--

13:56.587 --> 13:57.588
Lady Brightlingsea.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.173
Why, yes, of course.

14:00.007 --> 14:04.511
Yes. My mother, she insists
that I invite you and your daughters,

14:04.511 --> 14:06.805
Conchita's bridesmaids, to London.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.725
London?

14:11.560 --> 14:14.897
London, London? England?

14:14.897 --> 14:18.066
- All of Conchita's bridesmaids?
- There was talk, Mrs. Paramore,

14:18.066 --> 14:22.529
that for certain girls of refinement,
New York has become too limited.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.491
- Very limited, I quite agree.
- Yes, I quite agree too.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.118
And there's an urgency...

14:28.118 --> 14:29.494
The start of the season.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.206
...in order that Jinny
and the other debutantes

14:32.206 --> 14:35.709
may be presented at the Debutante's Ball.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.044
To the Queen.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.465
The Queen.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.719
Well, that is very kind
of Lady Brightlingsea.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.222
And Mrs. Paramore,

14:48.972 --> 14:52.935
next season when Jinny returns,
if she returns,

14:53.769 --> 14:57.272
she may be persuaded to drop in
on your little Assembly Ball.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.792
Miss Testvalley, do you know Lord Richard?

15:18.877 --> 15:20.879
Well, Annabel, as you'll soon see,

15:21.421 --> 15:24.299
England is a very small place.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.124
Lady Hopeleigh wrote yesterday
and asked me to remind--

15:57.124 --> 15:59.501
Lady Hopeleigh has no business
reminding me of anything.

16:00.085 --> 16:03.172
Jean Hopeleigh makes her debut this week
at the Queen's Ball.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.382
And you know her future is in your hands.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.509
Mother, Jean Hopeleigh should know

16:07.509 --> 16:10.304
I'll never marry anyone
who hunts me for the sake of my title.

16:10.846 --> 16:15.350
She has clear skin, Theodore,
open eyes, level shoulders.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.269
And she's not vacuous, as some are.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.479
You know those occasions fill me--

16:19.479 --> 16:22.482
I know you'd have yourself replaced
by a mechanical Duke of Tintagel,

16:22.482 --> 16:23.525
if it were up to you.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.904
The staring I can cope with.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.198
But it's the noise and the nonsen--

16:29.198 --> 16:33.160
Just to look, Theodore. For me.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.996
And a young lady of refinement, please.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.713
Do come back in. Nan.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.965
Look, an English tree.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.634
An English hedge!

16:48.634 --> 16:50.844
An English sheep in an English field.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.138
How do you do, sheep?

16:55.474 --> 16:56.725
Nan, please.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.561
Jinny, your hair will be impossible.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.902
How do you think
Jinny will wear her hair tonight?

17:07.486 --> 17:08.362
On her head.

17:08.362 --> 17:12.532
Yes, perhaps. Though, Lizzy, I'm sure
a lord will spot yours is glossier.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.078
I'm just saying your complexion dazzles
compared to Lizzy's.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.704
Lizzy's my best friend, Mother.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.832
We'll be sure of a grand welcome
from Lord and Lady "Brightlingsey."

17:20.832 --> 17:22.209
It's "Brittlesey," Mother.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.961
I've told you a hundred times.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.003
"Brittlesey." That's how you pronounce it.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.298
That's me. I can't get it in my head.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.176
I'm sure Lord Richard's parents
will be quite charming.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.846
You worked for them, Miss Testvalley.
Are they?

17:33.846 --> 17:35.013
Charming?

17:36.014 --> 17:37.933
Yes. Yes...

17:39.977 --> 17:41.061
in their own way.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.064
<i>There's a whole
ghastly, spitting crew of them.</i>

17:44.064 --> 17:46.692
Only Virginia and Elizabeth,
the two eldest, are debutantes.

17:46.692 --> 17:49.194
Yet they insist on coming mob-handed.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.197
James, you do know as the second son,

17:52.197 --> 17:54.741
you must either make a fortune
or marry one.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.996
They're all new money, yes.
And I'm quite sure they'll be frightful,

17:58.996 --> 18:01.874
but if New York's rejects must be
our mended roofs,

18:01.874 --> 18:03.917
then we may have to suffer invasion.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.170
But at least we shall be dry.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.380
So I am to be sold to the highest bidder?

18:10.048 --> 18:11.258
And do I have a choice?

18:11.967 --> 18:14.636
Yes, of course you do.
There are two of them.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.939
Will he be lost without me, Nan?

18:27.900 --> 18:30.986
Father? Of course.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.655
And I hope
you might be taller without him.

18:36.909 --> 18:39.411
I hope you girls will always be tall.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.914
Us? We're giants.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.999
Look at Jinny, she's a skyscraper.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.461
- Mabel!
- I can see you!

18:47.461 --> 18:49.463
And we could all be skyscrapers together.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.722
I wonder
if Conchita's burst yet with happiness.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.790
Girls!

19:25.958 --> 19:27.251
Girls, hi!

19:28.252 --> 19:29.253
Girls!

19:29.837 --> 19:30.671
Conchie!

19:30.671 --> 19:34.216
- Nan!
- Look at you.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.926
You're just perfect.

19:36.635 --> 19:38.053
Goodness.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.179
Girls, girls, girls.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.854
They're never still. Not one of them.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.482
They toss about so.

19:50.482 --> 19:53.777
Well, watch out
as they're tossing in our direction.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.530
Before we know it, there won't be
a family left in England

19:56.530 --> 19:58.740
without American poison in its veins.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.535
But without them,
how shall we afford poison...

20:02.411 --> 20:03.704
or veins?

20:05.873 --> 20:06.874
Window-shopping?

20:09.293 --> 20:10.836
A casual bystander.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.757
You say they're all as rich as Conchita,
Mama?

20:16.508 --> 20:18.969
One of the fathers is
in the American army.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.054
American army? There isn't any.

20:21.763 --> 20:22.764
They call him "Colonel."

20:23.682 --> 20:27.394
In the United States
they call dentists "Colonel."

20:32.649 --> 20:34.359
Girls, you can't imagine what a toll

20:34.359 --> 20:36.320
pregnancy takes on your dancing.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.822
Let's go inside.
Let me show you the house.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.992
Has our dancing suffered,
do you suppose, since pregnancy?

20:41.992 --> 20:43.869
I'm sure I've had no complaints.

20:45.579 --> 20:49.791
What a blessing, Mrs. Elmsworth,
that Conchita is so heavily with child.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.460
Blooming, indeed.

20:52.461 --> 20:55.005
And so very few months since her wedding.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.553
Of course, they pretend the Queen bit
is the start of the season,

21:01.553 --> 21:03.597
but that's just the afternoon appetizer.

21:03.597 --> 21:06.850
The evening's where the fun begins.
The ball.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.895
So I hope you brought your finery
for tomorrow.

21:09.895 --> 21:13.690
Every girl in London is just breathless
for the Debutante's Ball.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.818
They've waited their entire lives
to see a real-life duke,

21:16.818 --> 21:18.904
then parade down stairs for a husband.

21:18.904 --> 21:22.282
They're so proud of how old things are,
they forget that in the modern world

21:22.282 --> 21:23.951
we now have radiators

21:23.951 --> 21:25.661
and electric lights.

21:26.828 --> 21:29.498
Conchie, are you all right?

21:31.500 --> 21:36.213
This place is a pit full of snakes.
Watch you don't get bitten.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.275
Does everybody feel the butterflies,
do you suppose?

21:57.234 --> 22:00.946
My dear, our husbands only made
their money in trade,

22:02.197 --> 22:04.366
so our butterflies are inferior.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.993
How dare we even exist?

22:07.703 --> 22:10.122
Five years of doors in our faces.

22:11.248 --> 22:14.710
I'm surprised our noses
aren't entirely flat with it.

22:21.550 --> 22:25.345
Get used to an ocean of silence,
and swim about in it as well as you can.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.889
I haven't drowned yet.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.083
Isn't the soup heaven?

22:58.045 --> 23:01.507
It's so red. And warm.

23:02.674 --> 23:05.177
- Isn't it warm, Mrs. Elmsworth?
- It's warm soup, all right.

23:05.177 --> 23:07.179
Well, if I've learned anything
about the English,

23:07.179 --> 23:08.472
they sure know how to heat soup.

23:09.973 --> 23:13.936
But not too warm. That's the relief
of it, Lady "Brightlingsea."

23:13.936 --> 23:16.730
- Brightlingsea.
-"Brittlesey". Lady Brightlingsea.

23:22.903 --> 23:24.738
We've missed you in New York,
Lord Richard.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.449
He's been far too busy to miss you.

23:27.449 --> 23:31.537
England's just bursting with activity
and possibility for men.

23:31.537 --> 23:34.790
And what's wonderful for us girls
is that we get to sit home

23:34.790 --> 23:37.209
and wait for them to come back.

23:37.209 --> 23:41.964
What is it tomorrow, Richard?
Riding, shooting, cards?

23:42.548 --> 23:44.341
Not all at once, I hope.

23:45.092 --> 23:46.134
That wouldn't be--

23:46.802 --> 23:47.970
On a horse.

23:53.976 --> 23:55.727
On a horse.

23:58.772 --> 24:01.525
I like your pictures, Lord Seadown.

24:02.401 --> 24:03.944
Do you like all of them?

24:08.782 --> 24:10.158
Oh, well, I--

24:11.994 --> 24:14.746
I like a lot of them.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.416
Worth a flat-out fortune, I bet.

24:17.416 --> 24:19.501
How lucky they haven't had to be sold.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.462
Richard has a knack for picking up things
that are worth money.

24:26.884 --> 24:28.385
Is that Lady Jane Grey?

24:29.052 --> 24:31.138
- La-- Where?
- Yet there are so few portraits of her.

24:31.138 --> 24:32.639
I thought that could be a George Gower.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.474
But if that's Lady Jane Grey,
then that's--

24:34.474 --> 24:37.269
That would be too early for Gower,
wouldn't it?

24:37.269 --> 24:39.605
You know, I always thought
that being a queen for nine days

24:39.605 --> 24:42.774
was a very short time, but that was
before I crossed the Atlantic.

24:45.861 --> 24:46.987
That's very good.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.743
What do you think of the portrait,
Miss St. George?

24:55.245 --> 24:57.623
I like her arms.

25:24.942 --> 25:26.818
Is it really only half past 10:00?

25:27.569 --> 25:30.447
It's not the clocks
that are slow, it's this place.

25:31.865 --> 25:35.160
Girls, I've been
so starved of beauty and chatter.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.788
Seadown wasn't starved tonight.

25:39.331 --> 25:42.459
Perhaps at the ball tomorrow,
you could try not to attract attention.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.503
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

25:44.503 --> 25:47.673
I can make some space
for your expert art observations.

25:47.673 --> 25:49.466
"I like her arms."

25:49.466 --> 25:51.218
I will make sure.

25:51.969 --> 25:52.970
Stop.

25:53.887 --> 25:56.348
Do you even clean your nails?
Look at that.

25:56.348 --> 25:59.643
Wait. Tomorrow, I must show you
the dress that I'm wearing.

26:00.477 --> 26:02.437
I'm gonna-- Stop.

26:02.437 --> 26:03.689
I'm going.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.107
It's gonna be worth it.

26:13.615 --> 26:17.953
Chin up, darling.
You are still the pretty one.

26:17.953 --> 26:20.205
And one day, I'll be
the used-to-be-pretty one.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.544
What on Earth are you all doing in there?

26:25.544 --> 26:27.004
Being human.

26:29.214 --> 26:31.800
- This isn't New York, Conchita.
- I'm aware.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.594
Whatever happened to "being the party"?

26:33.594 --> 26:36.096
Well, now you're Lady Marable,
so it's time to be the wife.

26:37.097 --> 26:41.143
It's not how anybody here behaves.
I did ask you to behave.

26:41.143 --> 26:43.604
- Perhaps you should get a dog.
- You chose to come here.

26:43.604 --> 26:45.606
I chose you. I love you.

26:45.606 --> 26:47.191
And I love you.

26:47.191 --> 26:50.152
But the glaring and the jibes,
everyone on both sides.

26:50.861 --> 26:51.862
It's a battlefield.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.158
I'll be back next week.

26:56.742 --> 26:59.286
You're leaving?
With your wife in this state?

27:00.245 --> 27:02.122
Well, you have weeks yet.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.209
And what about the ball?

27:06.919 --> 27:10.088
I'm sorry.
I need to not be here for a while.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.424
Well, without you, they won't let me go.

27:12.424 --> 27:14.801
- Conchita, I'm sorry.
- So I won't go. Perfect.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.803
- Conchie, are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.096
I'm not gonna go to the ball.

27:18.096 --> 27:21.350
If I want to be ignored
and disapproved of, I can just stay home.

27:25.229 --> 27:26.605
I said it, didn't I?

27:27.981 --> 27:29.483
She might not fit in in England.

27:29.483 --> 27:33.278
- But you also said you get drunk on her.
- Yes, and being drunk is great fun.

27:33.904 --> 27:35.906
Of course it is, but not every day.

27:35.906 --> 27:39.826
Not morning till night.
Not with my parents watching.

28:02.391 --> 28:04.935
One expects it all gets easier
after the funeral.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.728
It doesn't, of course.

28:07.563 --> 28:11.984
So, tomorrow, the Debutante's Ball?

28:11.984 --> 28:13.068
Yes.

28:15.571 --> 28:16.822
What else is to be done?

28:28.375 --> 28:33.130
Your mother was the most beautiful woman
I ever saw.

28:35.174 --> 28:36.592
Utterly unpaintable.

28:49.271 --> 28:51.732
"As low as possible,"
Miss Testvalley said.

28:51.732 --> 28:53.692
And then the Queen extends her hand--

28:53.692 --> 28:54.860
And you lick it.

28:56.236 --> 28:58.780
Do you think the Queen will notice
if a curl comes out?

28:58.780 --> 29:00.324
Mother will notice.

29:00.324 --> 29:03.619
Yes, she will. And remember,
chin up, eyes down.

29:03.619 --> 29:05.913
Speak to every man there,
but only use short words

29:05.913 --> 29:07.789
because we don't want to confuse anyone.

29:08.290 --> 29:10.667
Don't ask. The bird came off worse.

29:12.085 --> 29:15.589
Oh, Jinny. Wait till London sees you.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.761
Girls, you must promise
to dance till you're dizzy.

29:20.761 --> 29:21.845
Dance? Have you seen my shoes?

29:21.845 --> 29:23.096
- I can't walk.
- I can do it.

29:23.096 --> 29:25.682
Dance till you're dizzy. Do you hear me?

29:25.682 --> 29:27.476
Come on, Nan! Come on!

29:27.476 --> 29:28.977
Jinny, come on.

29:30.187 --> 29:33.315
Come on, girls. This isn't playtime.
Please. Carriages are on their way.

29:33.315 --> 29:34.691
Jinny, this is your moment.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.985
You'll only get one,
so let's take it seriously.

29:37.569 --> 29:39.112
- Come, come, come.
- Conchie...

29:41.740 --> 29:43.033
are you all right?

29:45.953 --> 29:48.205
I didn't love him
because he was a lord, darling, did I?

29:50.415 --> 29:52.626
And now, it's like he's not even a man.

29:53.210 --> 29:54.545
We boarded that ship equals,

29:54.545 --> 29:57.005
and it's like every inch
he got closer to home,

29:57.005 --> 29:58.966
he just got further away from me.

30:01.844 --> 30:04.346
Oh, God, I'm so happy that you're here.

30:08.225 --> 30:09.226
Listen, Nan...

30:11.728 --> 30:13.397
when this baby comes, will you...

30:13.981 --> 30:15.566
I will be here.

30:15.566 --> 30:17.276
- Yeah.
- I will be here. Of course, I will.

30:17.276 --> 30:18.694
- Good.
- Yeah.

30:18.694 --> 30:22.155
- 'Cause it's an actual baby.
- Yes.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.532
How do you even...

30:26.785 --> 30:30.289
And it's gonna look like me.
You know, lucky baby.

30:30.289 --> 30:32.207
That's virtually
the whole point of babies,

30:32.207 --> 30:34.376
but it's not gonna look like them.

30:36.086 --> 30:40.257
What if they look at my baby
the same way they look at me?

30:43.927 --> 30:47.556
Well, I will be here. I promise you that.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.976
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.604
Oh, Nan.

31:30.641 --> 31:34.186
So the girls just have to walk
down the stairs,

31:34.186 --> 31:35.729
and then the men all get to pick one?

31:37.064 --> 31:39.191
I wish Conchita was here.

31:39.191 --> 31:40.567
That cake.

31:41.818 --> 31:43.904
I'd go and look at it,
but I can barely walk.

31:51.870 --> 31:53.747
My shoes are really bothering me.

31:55.874 --> 31:57.251
Why's everyone--

32:00.128 --> 32:02.840
- Who is he?
- The guest of honor,

32:02.840 --> 32:04.174
the Duke of Tintagel.

32:04.967 --> 32:06.385
- Duke?
- No.

32:06.385 --> 32:08.303
The greatest match in England.

32:14.017 --> 32:15.477
Oh, Nan.

32:27.573 --> 32:29.700
That's it, girls.
Look at where you're going.

32:46.800 --> 32:49.928
Though I hear the duke's mother
has made her choice for him already.

32:49.928 --> 32:52.973
There, look. Jean Hopeleigh.

32:53.515 --> 32:55.309
And the duke is the perfect son.

33:01.690 --> 33:03.150
There they are.

33:09.615 --> 33:11.617
Head up, Jinny. Shoulders back.

33:26.006 --> 33:27.591
Fourteen on form.

33:42.564 --> 33:43.941
Nan?

33:45.067 --> 33:47.027
Americans, they say.

33:47.611 --> 33:49.530
Outspoken, then, and vulgar.

33:49.530 --> 33:51.406
Imagine the bucketloads of cash.

33:51.406 --> 33:54.117
Imagine them on their backs
with their legs spread.

33:55.827 --> 33:59.164
Or imagine them as human beings
with no interest at all in your opinion

33:59.164 --> 34:02.042
and not caring if you're a king
or a mister.

34:07.965 --> 34:09.466
Nan St. George.

34:14.054 --> 34:16.723
Window, earring, staircase.

34:17.266 --> 34:19.309
Sorry, I'm just blurting out words.

34:19.893 --> 34:21.061
You.

34:22.603 --> 34:24.438
So, have you had enough?

34:25.732 --> 34:26.942
They're like cattle.

34:27.943 --> 34:31.362
That's rather harsh.
I think they're all lovely.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.697
Yes, they are lovely as anything,

34:32.697 --> 34:34.867
but they're also human beings
who are funny and smart.

34:41.123 --> 34:42.416
How is your mother?

34:48.547 --> 34:49.547
I'm so sorry.

34:53.927 --> 34:54.928
Shall we?

34:55.804 --> 34:56.847
Absolutely.

35:10.777 --> 35:11.778
Shall we?

35:38.388 --> 35:41.308
I can't decide if I wanna eat it
or if I wanna hide in it.

35:43.894 --> 35:47.064
Well, it's a long night.
I'm sure we can make time for both.

35:53.737 --> 35:54.738
Do you miss her?

35:58.450 --> 35:59.701
It's almost more than that.

36:01.995 --> 36:03.747
Mothers are irreplaceable.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.543
I miss the world that had her in it.

36:09.378 --> 36:12.172
Well, actually, I also miss my father,

36:13.924 --> 36:15.467
even when I'm in a room with him.

36:30.983 --> 36:33.151
What on earth? What was that?

36:34.278 --> 36:35.988
Just keep dancing.

36:42.327 --> 36:44.538
This is really bad, isn't it?

36:44.538 --> 36:46.456
This is as bad as it gets.

37:10.314 --> 37:12.399
You should absolutely
never be allowed up high.

37:12.399 --> 37:15.360
- Earrings, shoes...
- The earring wasn't my fault.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.237
In future,
if you so much as stand on a chair--

37:17.237 --> 37:19.531
What? What will you do?

37:20.866 --> 37:23.368
Stop you, I suppose,

37:24.703 --> 37:25.787
in some way.

37:26.997 --> 37:28.040
Annabel!

37:28.040 --> 37:30.542
I told you. She's not even
supposed to be interested.

37:33.337 --> 37:35.255
You were the same at dinner last night.

37:35.255 --> 37:37.549
How am I supposed to get people
to notice me with her?

37:37.549 --> 37:39.468
You're doing a good job
of people noticing you now.

37:39.468 --> 37:42.221
But I am trying so hard and I'm so tired,

37:42.221 --> 37:43.514
and this dress is so tight.

37:43.514 --> 37:45.724
And actually, Nan doesn't even
like any of this,

37:45.724 --> 37:48.435
the lords and the titles and so on.
She thinks it's all silly.

37:48.435 --> 37:50.479
True. It's stupid.
Who wants to be a part of this--

37:50.479 --> 37:53.815
I do. I like it. I wanted to meet someone.

37:53.815 --> 37:56.151
And we've come all this way,
and you're causing a commotion,

37:56.151 --> 37:58.362
as always, and everything's ruined.

37:58.362 --> 38:00.948
I'm sure your sister is trying
as hard as you.

38:00.948 --> 38:02.866
She dropped a shoe in a cake.

38:03.534 --> 38:06.411
Why do you always take her side
and stick up for her?

38:06.912 --> 38:08.205
Do you even know why?

38:09.248 --> 38:10.666
Where is your pride?

38:15.045 --> 38:16.713
My pride, Virginia?

38:18.298 --> 38:19.424
Why, it's here.

38:20.217 --> 38:21.468
Right here.

38:22.719 --> 38:26.431
It's in Nan, and it's in you. My girls.

38:34.356 --> 38:35.399
I'm sorry.

38:37.359 --> 38:39.945
- You don't get it, Nan. You don't get it.
- What?

38:39.945 --> 38:43.031
It's no different from New York. Here,
they just hate us for a different reason.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.534
- And it's my job to be noticed.
- But you were noticed.

38:45.534 --> 38:48.161
- Everyone in there was saying--
- I made the tiniest bit of progress.

38:48.161 --> 38:50.080
Meanwhile, you're being fascinating
all over the place,

38:50.080 --> 38:52.749
thinking of something funny
or smart to say,

38:52.749 --> 38:54.626
or having men lick cake from your fingers.

38:54.626 --> 38:57.754
- It wasn't men, it was one man.
- This isn't a joke, Nan.

38:57.754 --> 39:00.549
This is my whole life. It matters.

39:00.549 --> 39:03.760
Mother is forever standing up for you
and putting you ahead of me.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.221
When I say that I'm doing a good job,
she says, "Well, so is Nan."

39:06.221 --> 39:07.764
And, you know, it shouldn't be about you.

39:07.764 --> 39:10.684
It shouldn't ever be about you,
'cause you're not her daughter, Nan.

39:12.686 --> 39:13.770
What?

39:17.191 --> 39:18.275
I shouldn't have said that.

39:18.275 --> 39:20.777
Said what? What did you just say?

39:20.777 --> 39:22.112
- No, Nan.
- What did you just say?

39:22.112 --> 39:23.864
It's not my fault they kept it a secret.

39:23.864 --> 39:26.366
I was only a little girl.

39:26.366 --> 39:28.744
- You know what Daddy's like. It was--
- Kept what secret?

39:30.954 --> 39:33.749
One of Daddy's dalliances had...

39:35.876 --> 39:38.003
Mother wanted to avoid a scandal.

39:39.171 --> 39:40.756
Nobody knew, and nobody knows.

39:41.381 --> 39:43.800
Nan, I really shouldn't have
told you that. I'm sorry.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.761
Please don't tell Mother that I told you.

39:46.428 --> 39:49.181
- Please, Nan.
- There you both are.

39:50.390 --> 39:53.185
Now, Annabel, we have come all this way,

39:53.185 --> 39:55.812
and it does seem
that you are something of a distraction.

39:56.313 --> 39:59.608
So Miss Testvalley has kindly offered
that, tomorrow at first light,

39:59.608 --> 40:03.153
- just for a week or two--
- Some early nights, Nan.

40:03.153 --> 40:07.533
The castles we've talked of.
The fresh sea air in Cornwall.

41:37.164 --> 41:40.584
Lady Hopeleigh says
Jean waited for you at the ball.

41:40.584 --> 41:42.336
She's free to wait.

41:44.087 --> 41:46.089
And what are you free to do, Theo?

41:46.965 --> 41:48.383
To be left alone, Mother,

41:49.801 --> 41:51.595
till I meet a girl who doesn't know
what a duke is.

41:52.471 --> 41:55.224
I can't think where one
would find such a being.

41:56.099 --> 41:58.560
I'm sick of being tracked
like a wild animal.

42:32.803 --> 42:34.471
I think I'll stretch my legs.

43:04.334 --> 43:05.335
Nan?

43:06.587 --> 43:07.588
Nan!

43:33.822 --> 43:35.115
Did you talk to the bank?

43:35.115 --> 43:36.408
It's worse than I thought.

43:37.951 --> 43:39.786
How did it go with the American girl?

43:40.287 --> 43:41.663
Yes, I saw her...

43:43.624 --> 43:45.209
and I believe it's all going to plan.

43:45.209 --> 43:47.878
Then you'll be needing this.

43:49.796 --> 43:50.797
Your mother's.

44:12.528 --> 44:13.403
Oh, for heaven's sake,

44:13.403 --> 44:16.323
English women have been
getting on with the job for generations

44:16.323 --> 44:18.825
with no need for any silly fuss.

44:21.036 --> 44:22.996
- Baby's coming.
- Okay.

44:22.996 --> 44:25.999
Big push. Good girl.

45:33.442 --> 45:34.985
I didn't know anyone was...

45:35.819 --> 45:37.154
I startled you, I--

45:37.863 --> 45:40.240
If I'd known there was somebody else, I...

45:45.913 --> 45:47.497
I'm sorry.

45:47.497 --> 45:48.582
That's okay.

45:50.125 --> 45:51.126
Not mine, I see.

45:51.126 --> 45:54.421
No. They would be--

45:55.797 --> 45:57.674
- They would be rather...
- Restrictive?

45:57.674 --> 45:58.967
- Yes.
- Yes.

46:03.388 --> 46:04.556
You're an artist?

46:06.391 --> 46:09.394
- I paint.
- Really?

46:10.437 --> 46:11.438
I was just...

46:13.607 --> 46:15.150
I was just looking at the light.

46:16.485 --> 46:17.486
Isn't it just...

46:20.322 --> 46:22.741
I can't think of a better place to paint,

46:22.741 --> 46:25.285
though I've barely held a brush
in my life.

46:25.285 --> 46:27.454
Well, the beach makes artists of us all.

46:27.454 --> 46:30.374
Oh, yeah. Well, not just the beach.
I mean, the cliffs.

46:30.999 --> 46:33.585
And the castle.
Have you seen the castle up close?

46:35.712 --> 46:36.922
It's extraordinary.

46:38.924 --> 46:40.050
So I believe.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.729
- Anyway, I--
- Anyway--

46:54.189 --> 46:55.774
- I should...
- Yes.

46:59.695 --> 47:00.821
I'm Nan.

47:02.197 --> 47:03.198
Theo.

47:03.740 --> 47:05.325
- Theo?
- Theo.

47:09.830 --> 47:11.164
May I?

47:12.124 --> 47:13.834
Oh, God. It's just a mistake.

47:13.834 --> 47:15.127
It's a--

47:16.336 --> 47:17.462
- Well, I--
- It's a bird.

47:19.506 --> 47:21.175
- Well, it--
- It's beautiful.

47:21.175 --> 47:23.302
Well, it looks like a...

47:25.304 --> 47:27.431
- frog or something.
- No.

47:27.431 --> 47:30.058
It's hopeless, so I've started again...

47:32.102 --> 47:33.270
kind of.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.108
Well, imagine what it might become.

47:43.947 --> 47:47.659
I'm sorry. It's rare, I believe,

47:47.659 --> 47:50.871
to be able to talk so freely
with a person you know so little.

47:52.581 --> 47:54.625
Do you think so?
I think it's easier somehow.

48:01.089 --> 48:02.341
Perhaps we might--

48:02.966 --> 48:05.427
I'm often down here to paint or swim.

48:05.427 --> 48:07.679
No, I'm afraid we're going home
to New York.

48:10.265 --> 48:12.392
Well, that's a great shame.

48:14.686 --> 48:17.940
Good luck with your frog-birds?

48:18.857 --> 48:19.983
Thank you.

48:22.152 --> 48:24.947
Goodbye.
