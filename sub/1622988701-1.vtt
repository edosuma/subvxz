01:27.778 --> 01:30.580
- You made it.
- I did.

01:30.613 --> 01:33.583
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:33.616 --> 01:35.386
- Good to see you.
- You too.

01:37.387 --> 01:38.689
Erin, Alex.

01:38.722 --> 01:41.425
Alex, this is Erin.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.161
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:46.229 --> 01:48.165
Looking good out there, girl.

01:48.199 --> 01:49.834
Yeah, I know.

01:49.866 --> 01:51.401
Uh, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna grab a beer.

01:51.434 --> 01:53.503
Did... did you want anything,
can I...?

01:53.537 --> 01:54.939
I don't drink.

01:54.972 --> 01:56.506
Well, how about a Coke?

01:56.540 --> 01:57.741
They're free for me.

01:57.775 --> 02:00.478
Save your $5.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.580
- You got it.
- I'll take a...

02:02.612 --> 02:05.715
Uh... okay.

02:07.884 --> 02:10.454
Hello, did you hear me?

02:10.485 --> 02:12.789
I got my final mark
on that major paper I wrote

02:12.823 --> 02:14.759
on Paradise Regained,

02:14.791 --> 02:18.962
which I have now read
for the third time by the way.

02:18.996 --> 02:21.199
The fucking instructor

02:21.231 --> 02:23.533
says that
my interpretation of Milton

02:23.567 --> 02:26.337
doesn't fully explain
his continuing role

02:26.369 --> 02:28.838
in Western literature.

02:28.872 --> 02:30.607
Dick.

02:30.641 --> 02:33.644
- What was your grade?
- A fucking minus.

02:38.015 --> 02:40.517
Oh, did she show, Erin?

02:40.551 --> 02:42.954
What, does everybody
know this girl but me?

02:42.986 --> 02:45.323
Uh, no, I barely know her.

02:45.355 --> 02:46.957
She was in our
Philosophy of Literature class

02:46.991 --> 02:48.759
with me and Zack,

02:48.791 --> 02:52.262
and I think
he kind of asked her out.

02:52.295 --> 02:53.630
Kind of?

02:53.664 --> 02:55.666
Well, I think he thinks he did.

02:57.635 --> 02:59.003
So, he's into her?

02:59.035 --> 03:01.838
Uh, well, she's a female,

03:01.872 --> 03:03.674
so yeah.

03:07.044 --> 03:09.680
Is she into him?

03:09.712 --> 03:11.581
- Hey, Jules.
- Oh, hey, how are you?

03:11.615 --> 03:14.684
Oh, she's devastated,
she got an A minus on a paper.

03:14.718 --> 03:16.354
Oh, buddy.

03:16.386 --> 03:18.656
Oh, shut it.

03:18.688 --> 03:21.458
You know,
I think I wanna go dance.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.694
Is there anybody
I can convince to join me?

03:23.726 --> 03:25.830
- Zack, let's go.
- Absolutely.

03:25.862 --> 03:28.565
Oh, yeah, go show me your moves.

03:28.599 --> 03:29.934
Yes, ma'am.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.806
You sure I can't tempt you?

03:35.838 --> 03:37.942
Uh, no,

03:37.974 --> 03:40.010
I mean, the table.

03:40.044 --> 03:42.313
I should watch the table,
I... I don't want someone

03:42.345 --> 03:43.781
to take it.

03:43.813 --> 03:45.849
No, we wouldn't want that.

04:02.633 --> 04:03.868
Hey, baby, what's going on?

04:03.901 --> 04:05.368
Ow.

04:05.402 --> 04:08.005
Oh, you're a little feisty,
all right.

04:08.038 --> 04:09.674
Okay.

04:13.043 --> 04:14.645
What, it's just a little dance.

04:14.677 --> 04:17.714
- I'm a good dancer.
- Ugh, no, you're not.

04:41.037 --> 04:42.672
Hey.

04:42.705 --> 04:44.075
How's the table?

04:44.108 --> 04:46.677
Fine, I just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.945
Oh, yeah, just perils
of the dance floor.

04:48.979 --> 04:50.781
Did you come to dance with me?

04:50.813 --> 04:54.351
Uh, no, I don't think
I can keep up.

04:54.385 --> 04:57.587
I just... just wanted to
check you're okay, that's all.

04:57.621 --> 05:00.858
Well, you did, and I am.

05:00.890 --> 05:02.659
Okay.

05:04.561 --> 05:06.796
And now I need
to be making sure

05:06.830 --> 05:08.998
that you're okay.

05:09.032 --> 05:10.835
Jeez.

05:16.873 --> 05:19.976
Thank you.

05:20.010 --> 05:23.546
Hey, uh, have a good night,
see you later.

05:23.580 --> 05:24.849
Uh, wait.

05:27.049 --> 05:29.886
- What's up?
- Um, do you wanna

05:29.919 --> 05:31.722
share a cab or something?

05:31.755 --> 05:35.159
I live pretty close,
so I won't be catching a cab.

05:35.191 --> 05:39.162
Um, do you wanna
share a sidewalk?

05:53.142 --> 05:55.546
Oh, shit.

05:55.578 --> 05:57.013
Ah, for fuck's sake!

06:00.950 --> 06:03.820
This is fucked.

06:03.854 --> 06:06.022
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Julia,

06:06.056 --> 06:08.625
what the fuck?

06:08.659 --> 06:10.493
Don't take that tone with me.

06:10.527 --> 06:12.695
Beach, let's go.

06:12.729 --> 06:14.899
Dude, you literally
just woke me up.

06:14.931 --> 06:17.200
I am not ready for the beach,
and it is really early

06:17.234 --> 06:18.868
for your cleavage.

06:18.902 --> 06:22.106
First off, it is not my fault
that you slept in,

06:22.138 --> 06:26.075
and secondly, it's never
too early for my cleavage.

06:26.109 --> 06:27.611
Let's go.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.981
God, I am so glad I went from

06:32.015 --> 06:33.784
a comfortable
laying-down position

06:33.816 --> 06:36.219
to an uncomfortable
laying-down position.

06:36.253 --> 06:38.823
Okay.

06:38.856 --> 06:43.127
Try to think of it
as full-body exfoliation.

06:43.159 --> 06:45.529
But, I'm more thinking
of it as a sunburn,

06:45.561 --> 06:47.864
and sand in my crack.

06:47.897 --> 06:50.934
Are you ever happy
about anything?

06:50.967 --> 06:53.136
Hardly ever.

06:53.169 --> 06:54.904
Room for one more?

06:54.938 --> 06:56.873
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

06:56.907 --> 06:58.709
Yeah, sure.

07:02.678 --> 07:04.582
I didn't know
you were joining us.

07:04.614 --> 07:06.783
- Is that all right?
- Absolutely.

07:06.816 --> 07:09.486
Of course.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.690
Zack likes you,

07:12.722 --> 07:14.724
so you're stuck with us.

07:14.758 --> 07:16.226
Could be worse.

07:21.698 --> 07:23.500
I think I'm gonna go for a dip.

07:23.534 --> 07:25.002
Be right back.

07:27.104 --> 07:29.940
So, is she just,
like, our friend now?

07:29.972 --> 07:31.641
I don't know, why?

07:31.674 --> 07:34.044
You don't like her?

07:34.077 --> 07:35.813
No, I...

07:35.846 --> 07:37.748
I don't know her.

07:37.780 --> 07:40.116
I mean, she seems nice.

07:40.150 --> 07:42.753
She's polite,
and friendly, and...

07:42.786 --> 07:45.022
Alex, you don't
have to convince me.

07:45.054 --> 07:47.525
I don't care if you like her.

07:47.558 --> 07:49.260
I didn't say I didn't like her.

07:49.292 --> 07:51.995
Mhm.

07:52.029 --> 07:54.198
- Oh.
- Oh, thank you.

08:08.745 --> 08:10.314
Oh, no, I'm good, thank you.

08:10.347 --> 08:12.181
It's for me.

08:12.214 --> 08:14.084
If you don't mind?

08:14.116 --> 08:16.087
- Please?
- Oh, yeah.

08:18.589 --> 08:20.858
Yeah.

09:14.144 --> 09:15.946
Oh, okay, well let's just
cover all the bases.

09:15.978 --> 09:18.081
No, none of us are into Zack.

09:18.115 --> 09:20.717
He's like
an annoying younger brother.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.819
- Hm.
- But, you know,

09:22.852 --> 09:24.722
wouldn't be life without him,
though, don't tell him

09:24.755 --> 09:28.125
- I said that.
- Lips are sealed.

09:28.158 --> 09:30.728
So, is he not your type, or...?

09:30.760 --> 09:33.262
I don't know, I haven't
really thought about it.

09:33.295 --> 09:35.765
What is your type?

09:35.799 --> 09:38.401
Confident, attractive, smart.

09:38.434 --> 09:39.969
How about you?

09:40.002 --> 09:42.038
You, generally.

09:42.072 --> 09:43.907
What?

09:43.939 --> 09:46.242
Oh, I mean,
same... same as... as you.

09:46.275 --> 09:48.746
Same as you said just...

09:48.779 --> 09:50.179
Oh, my God, are you okay?

09:50.212 --> 09:52.116
Yeah.

09:52.149 --> 09:55.184
- You're bleeding.
- Yeah.

09:55.217 --> 09:57.121
- Come on.
- No, that's okay.

09:57.154 --> 09:59.657
- Let me take care of it.
- It's totally fine.

09:59.689 --> 10:01.724
It's... yeah.

10:01.757 --> 10:03.726
Ow.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.261
Have a seat.

10:10.900 --> 10:14.737
Wow, this is
a real happening place, huh?

10:14.770 --> 10:16.707
We're closed on Sundays.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.712
Have you worked here
for a long time?

10:21.745 --> 10:24.881
Uh, yeah,
we've had it for a while.

10:24.914 --> 10:27.351
- We?
- My family owns it.

10:29.452 --> 10:32.990
Guess I kind of own it.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.359
Oh.

10:35.391 --> 10:37.226
Wow.

10:39.962 --> 10:42.065
Yeah, my dad has this habit
of buying businesses,

10:42.098 --> 10:44.801
and he kind of left me
in charge of this one,

10:44.834 --> 10:46.469
so.

10:46.502 --> 10:48.438
Hey, that must be nice.

10:51.107 --> 10:53.309
Oh, I... well I didn't... I...

10:53.342 --> 10:56.112
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

10:56.145 --> 10:59.449
I just meant it must be nice.

10:59.482 --> 11:01.017
Yeah.

11:01.050 --> 11:04.020
Yeah, it's as nice as
material things can be I guess.

11:05.489 --> 11:07.324
What do you mean?

11:09.159 --> 11:10.928
I mean that my dad
doesn't really get

11:10.961 --> 11:14.965
the whole feelings thing,
so he uses his money instead.

11:14.997 --> 11:17.400
But hey, it's not like I'm just
some complacent manager.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.770
I do actually work, you know.

11:21.837 --> 11:23.506
Okay.

11:23.539 --> 11:25.842
I mean, I wasn't
suggesting that you were.

11:29.913 --> 11:31.914
I think it's very cool

11:31.948 --> 11:34.918
that you're the boss.

11:34.951 --> 11:37.755
- You think so?
- Yeah.

11:42.259 --> 11:44.327
How about you,
what's your story?

11:46.462 --> 11:49.900
Uh, it was just
me and my mom growing up.

11:49.933 --> 11:54.004
She worked a lot,
but she got the feelings thing.

11:54.036 --> 11:56.506
- Mhm.
- Sounds like you and me

11:56.539 --> 11:59.409
had completely opposite
childhoods.

12:10.986 --> 12:13.122
You know, he's not all bad.

12:13.155 --> 12:16.226
- Who, you're dad?
- Yeah.

12:16.259 --> 12:18.996
I'm not judging.

12:19.029 --> 12:22.399
Just laid my entire
life story out on you.

12:22.432 --> 12:24.433
Sorry about that.

12:24.467 --> 12:27.203
I guess that you're just sort of

12:27.236 --> 12:30.006
easy to talk to.

12:32.475 --> 12:35.445
How about you,
what happened to your dad?

12:35.477 --> 12:38.481
Uh, he left when I was 4.

12:40.549 --> 12:42.986
I didn't really know him.

12:43.019 --> 12:46.089
According to my mom,
that's a good thing.

12:46.121 --> 12:48.424
You see your mom a lot?

12:48.457 --> 12:50.394
Uh, no.

12:50.427 --> 12:52.196
No, she, uh...

12:52.228 --> 12:55.331
she died.

12:55.365 --> 12:57.601
I'm sorry.

12:57.634 --> 13:00.938
Oh, it's okay.

13:00.971 --> 13:02.840
I mean, it's not okay,

13:02.872 --> 13:05.908
but I'm fine.

13:10.480 --> 13:12.916
There's this, uh...

13:12.948 --> 13:16.553
There's this spot
down by the beach

13:16.586 --> 13:18.087
that I like to go to.

13:20.055 --> 13:21.390
It reminds me of her.

13:31.167 --> 13:33.136
Let me see your arm.

13:33.169 --> 13:36.005
I think you got
some gravel in it or something.

13:36.039 --> 13:38.140
Yeah.

13:38.174 --> 13:40.077
It's okay, though,
just throw a Band-Aid on there

13:40.110 --> 13:42.212
or something.

13:42.245 --> 13:44.414
- I'll be gentle.
- Okay.

13:52.923 --> 13:54.524
Are you ready?

13:54.557 --> 13:56.293
I don't know.

13:59.696 --> 14:02.199
That probably hurts.

14:02.231 --> 14:04.601
All good.

14:14.611 --> 14:16.313
- Can you, um...?
- Oh.

14:51.614 --> 14:54.985
Does it feel better?

14:55.018 --> 14:57.087
Yeah.

14:59.688 --> 15:01.958
So, did I tell you
about my movie idea?

15:01.991 --> 15:03.260
- No.
- Yeah, I mean, so I'm writing

15:03.293 --> 15:06.263
this movie, and it's you and me
are the leads,

15:06.295 --> 15:10.166
and I play a character
named Robin Banks, okay?

15:10.199 --> 15:14.637
No, but wait,
you're Greta Waycar.

15:14.670 --> 15:17.373
- You're dumb.
- No, it's genius.

15:19.342 --> 15:22.346
- Hey.
- Hey, Al.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.015
- Where's Erin?
- Ah, she had to work

15:25.048 --> 15:26.549
or something.

15:26.582 --> 15:30.120
Aw, I got her a Coke.

15:30.153 --> 15:32.356
Before you say anything,
it wasn't you.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.057
I didn't scare her away?

15:34.090 --> 15:36.160
- No, Zack.
- Thank God.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.162
But, like,
what'd she say about me?

15:40.196 --> 15:43.133
- Oh, my God, get over yourself.
- What?

15:43.165 --> 15:44.667
I need to know.

15:44.701 --> 15:46.603
I don't know, nothing.

15:46.635 --> 15:48.237
Nothing?

15:48.270 --> 15:50.573
At all?

15:50.606 --> 15:52.342
Really?

15:52.375 --> 15:55.111
No, no, I mean,

15:55.145 --> 15:56.413
you're a good guy or whatever.

15:56.446 --> 15:59.016
Just keep doing that.

15:59.049 --> 16:00.449
I don't know about that.

16:00.482 --> 16:02.752
Good guys finish last.

16:02.785 --> 16:06.323
Unless that's what she likes.

16:06.356 --> 16:09.056
I don't know what she likes.

16:09.058 --> 16:11.694
If you wanna ask her out,
just ask her out,

16:11.727 --> 16:15.097
and if she says, "No,"
then you have your answer.

16:15.130 --> 16:18.267
Yeah, true.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.236
Aw, Zackary,

16:20.270 --> 16:23.106
do you need me
to ask her out for you?

16:23.139 --> 16:25.308
No, I do not.

16:25.341 --> 16:27.344
It's just, you know,
if I ask her out

16:27.376 --> 16:28.811
and she says, "No,"
then she's not gonna

16:28.845 --> 16:31.048
wanna hang with us anymore.

16:31.081 --> 16:33.517
I kinda like her
hanging with us.

16:33.549 --> 16:36.553
Good point.

16:36.586 --> 16:38.789
What, what, it's a good point.

16:38.822 --> 16:40.690
I mean, she's nice.

16:40.722 --> 16:43.159
It's nice to make
new friends who are nice.

16:43.193 --> 16:45.761
Why do you need new friends?

16:45.794 --> 16:48.698
Aw, Jule, you need to
go to jelly school.

16:48.731 --> 16:50.266
Ew!

16:50.299 --> 16:52.835
Never touch me like that again.

16:52.869 --> 16:54.371
I'll never touch you
like that again.

16:56.606 --> 16:59.308
So, Al, can you
talk me up to her?

16:59.342 --> 17:02.678
Please, can you talk about
literally anything else?

17:02.712 --> 17:04.180
I don't know,
what makes you think that

17:04.214 --> 17:06.650
she would listen to me,
or that we even talk?

17:06.682 --> 17:09.486
I figured you guys became pals.

17:09.518 --> 17:11.487
Well, I mean, she's...

17:11.521 --> 17:13.390
Nice.

17:27.369 --> 17:29.673
- What time's happy hour?
- Oh, shit.

17:29.706 --> 17:31.775
I'm so sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

17:31.807 --> 17:34.343
No, it's okay... oh!

17:34.377 --> 17:36.847
- Oh, my God, okay.
- Okay.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.349
Ah, right.

17:42.485 --> 17:43.887
Uh.

17:43.919 --> 17:46.323
Okay.

17:48.725 --> 17:51.495
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yes.

17:51.527 --> 17:54.230
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

17:54.264 --> 17:57.133
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

17:57.167 --> 18:00.704
I, um, came by to see
if you're coming out...

18:00.736 --> 18:03.806
uh, to the club,
after your shift.

18:03.840 --> 18:08.445
I mean, do you want to come out
to the club to dance?

18:08.477 --> 18:10.479
Right, right, um,

18:10.513 --> 18:12.448
I'm off work pretty late, so.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.118
Okay.

18:15.752 --> 18:17.654
Well, I mean,

18:17.687 --> 18:20.256
that was more of
a for-your-information

18:20.290 --> 18:22.292
than... than a no.

18:22.324 --> 18:25.294
Okay, so it's a yes then.

18:25.328 --> 18:27.264
Uh, it's a maybe.

18:27.296 --> 18:29.232
Probably.

18:33.535 --> 18:36.773
I mean, I was
in the neighborhood.

18:36.805 --> 18:39.308
That's why I'm here,
'cause Julia told me

18:39.342 --> 18:41.210
that you worked here,
and I was passing by,

18:41.244 --> 18:43.547
- and so I...
- Right, um,

18:43.580 --> 18:45.814
well it's really nice
to see you, though.

18:45.848 --> 18:47.584
Thank you.

18:49.619 --> 18:54.591
Okay, so I guess I'll maybe,
probably see you later?

18:54.623 --> 18:56.692
- Yeah.
- Maybe, probably.

18:58.727 --> 19:01.965
Yes, um.

19:01.997 --> 19:04.433
Thanks for

19:04.467 --> 19:06.369
stopping by.

19:06.401 --> 19:08.237
You got it.

19:09.738 --> 19:12.342
Hey, before I forget,
do you have a pen?

19:12.374 --> 19:14.777
Uh, yeah, I think I do, sure.

19:27.857 --> 19:30.260
In case you need me
for anything.

19:31.928 --> 19:33.764
I'll see you later.

19:35.698 --> 19:37.534
Uh, see you later.

20:03.426 --> 20:04.961
Okay.

20:04.994 --> 20:06.996
You look good.

20:07.030 --> 20:08.865
You look fine,
you're totally overthinking this

20:08.898 --> 20:11.834
'cause nothing's happening.

20:11.868 --> 20:13.770
Oh, God, what if
something is happening?

20:20.342 --> 20:21.878
Hey, what are we looking at?

20:21.910 --> 20:23.912
A very happy Zack.

20:23.946 --> 20:26.582
Oh, yeah, is he making friends?

20:26.615 --> 20:29.551
Well.

20:38.593 --> 20:40.529
I have to go.

20:40.563 --> 20:42.564
- Uh.
- Yeah, sorry.

20:44.766 --> 20:46.503
Okay.

20:53.676 --> 20:55.445
Alex.

20:55.477 --> 20:57.046
Alex, wait.

20:59.815 --> 21:01.750
I'm sorry.

21:01.784 --> 21:03.652
For what?

21:03.686 --> 21:06.356
I don't usually drink,
and I was dancing,

21:06.389 --> 21:08.824
- and I...
- You don't owe me anything.

21:11.593 --> 21:13.996
I just don't want you to think
I was doing it to hurt you

21:14.030 --> 21:15.699
or something.

21:17.432 --> 21:19.736
I don't know what you mean.

21:21.536 --> 21:24.673
- I'm just nervous.
- Nervous?

21:24.707 --> 21:26.810
About what?

21:26.842 --> 21:28.879
You make me nervous.

21:41.757 --> 21:43.625
Erin, where are you going?

21:43.659 --> 21:46.428
I'm all sweaty,
I'm going for a swim.

21:46.461 --> 21:47.963
I thought I was
walking you home,

21:47.996 --> 21:50.632
not brushing up on my CPR.

21:50.666 --> 21:52.402
So, come in with me then.

21:54.637 --> 21:56.406
That doesn't make any sense.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.984
Are you coming?

22:17.126 --> 22:19.796
Hey, there you are,
I was looking for you.

22:19.829 --> 22:21.798
Thought you left.

22:21.831 --> 22:24.767
No, I'm right here.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.002
Did you wanna get dressed?

22:26.034 --> 22:27.836
I mean, I can wait.

22:27.870 --> 22:30.439
Are you sleeping
with me tonight?

22:32.842 --> 22:34.977
Uh.

22:35.011 --> 22:36.678
I just meant 'cause my bed's
more comfortable

22:36.711 --> 22:40.416
than the couch, so.

22:40.449 --> 22:42.151
Oh, right.

22:42.185 --> 22:44.921
No, cool, um.

22:44.954 --> 22:47.957
No, I was just gonna
head home soon.

22:47.989 --> 22:49.625
Okay.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.893
Sure.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.097
Wait, I'm sorry.

22:54.130 --> 22:56.966
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

22:56.998 --> 22:59.701
Oh, my God.

22:59.735 --> 23:02.472
It's okay.

23:02.505 --> 23:04.474
Hey, it's okay.

23:13.716 --> 23:15.717
Um, listen,

23:15.751 --> 23:18.221
I... I...

23:18.254 --> 23:19.688
I don't know what's happening,
and I don't wanna

23:19.721 --> 23:21.824
misread anything.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.494
I don't think that
you're misreading anything.

23:27.897 --> 23:30.066
Will you look at me, please?

23:54.090 --> 23:56.192
Do you want me?

24:05.967 --> 24:08.537
Yes.

26:56.805 --> 26:58.240
Erin?

27:01.043 --> 27:02.911
Shit.

27:15.357 --> 27:17.694
Alex, what are you doing here?

27:17.726 --> 27:19.996
Oh, well you weren't there
when I woke up, so.

27:20.028 --> 27:23.965
I was, uh...
I needed to get to work.

27:23.998 --> 27:25.400
Right, I...

27:25.434 --> 27:28.171
Uh, could we...?

27:28.204 --> 27:29.906
Sure.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.180
What's up... ah.

27:40.416 --> 27:42.150
Okay, um,

27:42.184 --> 27:44.120
can we talk about
what happened last night?

27:44.152 --> 27:46.389
- No.
- What, are you serious?

27:46.421 --> 27:48.056
Yeah, something happened,

27:48.090 --> 27:51.260
I don't know what, and I...

27:51.293 --> 27:52.928
You... you don't... you don't know...

27:52.961 --> 27:54.463
- Erin, we slept together.
- Okay, can you please

27:54.496 --> 27:56.032
keep your voice down,
because we are at

27:56.064 --> 27:57.332
my work right now?

27:57.365 --> 27:58.867
- So, uh...
- It's not fricking illegal.

27:58.900 --> 28:00.236
- I mean...
- Okay, I need you to

28:00.268 --> 28:01.770
forget about this.

28:03.872 --> 28:06.241
What? No, no.

28:06.275 --> 28:08.977
No, Erin, it was amazing,
and you were right there with me

28:09.011 --> 28:11.114
and I know that
you felt the same way.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.814
- Stop.
- You came on to me.

28:12.848 --> 28:14.283
- I wasn't gonna do anything.
- Please, I need you to

28:14.315 --> 28:17.853
fucking stop, I need you to
fucking stop, Alex!

28:17.887 --> 28:19.856
Can you please fucking stop?

28:23.292 --> 28:24.794
Can you please go?

28:26.795 --> 28:28.397
I need you to go, please.

29:10.272 --> 29:12.942
- Hey, Jule.
- Hey, you.

29:12.975 --> 29:16.111
- What's up?
- How are you?

29:16.144 --> 29:18.313
Yeah, I'm fine.

29:18.346 --> 29:21.449
Great, but how are you actually?

29:21.483 --> 29:23.519
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb,

29:23.552 --> 29:25.021
you completely bailed
last night.

29:25.053 --> 29:28.190
- Where'd you go?
- Yeah, sorry.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.457
Well, don't be sorry,
just tell me

29:29.490 --> 29:30.926
what's going on with you.

29:33.495 --> 29:36.299
Hello?

29:36.332 --> 29:40.268
Can you just trust that
I'll tell you when I'm ready?

29:40.302 --> 29:43.171
Okay.

29:43.205 --> 29:44.439
Should I be worried?

29:47.508 --> 29:49.978
No.

29:50.012 --> 29:51.313
Okay.

29:51.346 --> 29:53.014
Come for a drink tonight?

29:55.316 --> 29:58.153
Uh, yeah, sure.

29:58.187 --> 29:59.388
I mean,
I'll meet you down there.

29:59.420 --> 30:01.591
Cool, see you soon, pal.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.462
Fuck.

30:25.915 --> 30:27.082
Where have you have been?

30:27.115 --> 30:30.118
You almost missed happy hour.

30:30.151 --> 30:31.286
I'm sorry.

30:33.354 --> 30:36.525
Anyway, so as I was saying,
I was on a date with this dude,

30:36.557 --> 30:38.660
and he asks me
what I like to do for fun.

30:38.694 --> 30:40.496
I hate that question.

30:40.528 --> 30:44.232
So, I start telling him about
this book that I'm reading.

30:44.265 --> 30:47.202
Alex, have I told you
about this, book guy?

30:47.236 --> 30:49.639
Uh, yeah, sure, I think...
I think so.

30:49.671 --> 30:51.339
Anyway,

30:51.372 --> 30:53.008
so I'm telling him
about this book,

30:53.042 --> 30:55.410
and he gets this look
on his face,

30:55.444 --> 30:58.614
like either he's never heard
the word "book" before,

30:58.647 --> 31:01.250
or the idea of a woman reading

31:01.283 --> 31:04.419
is way too much for
his tiny brain to comprehend.

31:04.453 --> 31:07.123
I really don't get it, I mean,
guys say that they want a girl

31:07.156 --> 31:09.358
that's smart and interesting,
but I mean,

31:09.390 --> 31:10.993
really they actually don't.

31:12.024 --> 31:13.129
- Right?
- Yeah.

31:13.161 --> 31:16.131
Hey, how's the weather
where you are?

31:16.165 --> 31:19.068
- What?
- Where are you right now?

31:19.101 --> 31:21.370
Uh, I think
I'm gonna get a drink.

31:21.402 --> 31:22.604
Actually, you know, I should go.

31:22.638 --> 31:25.073
I have this thing
that I gotta do.

31:25.107 --> 31:26.575
Uhh, like what?

31:26.608 --> 31:28.411
It's Friday night
during the summer.

31:28.444 --> 31:30.980
What do you have to do?

31:31.013 --> 31:33.316
Early inventory.

31:33.349 --> 31:37.285
Like you've never
done inventory hungover.

31:37.319 --> 31:39.655
Erin, please explain to her

31:39.688 --> 31:43.124
why she needs to stop pretending
to be so responsible.

31:43.158 --> 31:45.428
You really gotta stop it.

31:48.130 --> 31:50.366
Okay.

31:50.399 --> 31:52.668
Alex!

31:52.700 --> 31:56.271
Alex, what the hell?

31:56.304 --> 31:58.673
I just can't.

32:01.709 --> 32:03.278
Hey, Al

32:05.447 --> 32:08.316
All right.

32:08.350 --> 32:10.119
What's wrong with her?

32:10.151 --> 32:12.354
- I don't know.
- Are you sure?

32:12.388 --> 32:15.757
Yeah, Julia,
I don't even know her.

32:15.791 --> 32:18.727
- I don't believe you.
- Hey.

32:18.761 --> 32:21.063
What the fuck was that about?

32:21.095 --> 32:23.298
I have no idea.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.200
- I should go after her.
- No.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.436
Stop mothering her, okay?

32:27.468 --> 32:30.305
Storming off like that,
she needs some time alone.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.308
She went to the beach, just...

32:32.341 --> 32:34.577
she'll be fine.

32:34.610 --> 32:36.611
You know, I think
I'm gonna head out.

32:36.644 --> 32:38.179
Honestly,
I wouldn't worry about her.

32:38.213 --> 32:40.282
She seems like
a really tough girl.

32:40.314 --> 32:42.418
I'm sure
she's gonna be fine, so.

32:44.419 --> 32:45.653
- Erin.
- Hm?

32:45.687 --> 32:48.024
Alex has been through
a lot of shit.

32:48.056 --> 32:51.026
If she is messed up
in something, please tell me.

32:51.060 --> 32:53.596
Yeah, honestly, I'm sorry,
but I don't know.

32:53.629 --> 32:57.466
Jule, why would
she know anything?

32:57.498 --> 32:59.101
Well, have a good night, guys.

33:11.780 --> 33:14.683
Alex.

33:19.321 --> 33:23.458
No, you don't get to come here
and look at me like that.

33:23.492 --> 33:26.361
I didn't mean to hurt you,
I'm sorry.

33:29.331 --> 33:32.333
I don't understand.

33:32.367 --> 33:35.104
We didn't do anything wrong.

33:35.137 --> 33:37.505
You're acting like we've
done this terrible thing.

33:37.538 --> 33:39.842
Are you in a relationship
or something?

33:39.874 --> 33:42.243
You don't get it, do you?

33:42.276 --> 33:43.578
No, I don't get it.

33:43.611 --> 33:46.415
I need you to explain it to me.

33:46.448 --> 33:48.184
I fucking can't.

33:58.226 --> 33:59.562
Did you like it?

34:03.564 --> 34:05.333
You had fun with me?

34:05.367 --> 34:06.669
Yes.

34:08.268 --> 34:09.771
And you like me?

34:11.840 --> 34:14.443
Do we really have to
talk about it all night?

34:20.349 --> 34:22.684
What are you so scared
of talking about?

34:22.717 --> 34:24.219
Are you scared
of the way you feel?

34:26.188 --> 34:28.755
Do we really have to do this?

34:30.791 --> 34:33.428
- Are you scared of being gay?
- Okay, shut the fuck up.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.697
I'm not fucking scared.

34:35.731 --> 34:37.600
You're just wrong.

34:37.632 --> 34:39.568
I need to go.

34:39.601 --> 34:40.902
- Wrong?
- Yeah, you're just

34:40.936 --> 34:42.469
fucking wrong, Alex!

34:42.503 --> 34:44.371
I'm leaving.

34:44.405 --> 34:45.806
Erin!

35:14.202 --> 35:16.438
Hey.

35:16.470 --> 35:18.206
It's Erin.

35:20.242 --> 35:22.144
What are you doing?

35:34.256 --> 35:35.758
What are you doing here?

35:35.791 --> 35:39.628
That's seriously what you wanna
say to me right now?

35:39.660 --> 35:42.697
Alex, what the fuck is going on?

35:44.633 --> 35:46.468
Just having a drink.

35:46.501 --> 35:49.905
You won't answer my calls
and you won't talk to me.

35:49.938 --> 35:51.974
What's happening here, Al?

35:52.006 --> 35:54.209
You're the one with straight As.

35:54.242 --> 35:55.910
I'm sure you can figure it out.

35:55.943 --> 35:58.680
Why are you being a smart ass?

35:58.713 --> 36:01.282
Look, I just came here
to have a drink, okay, alone.

36:01.316 --> 36:04.687
You don't get to come here
and start yelling at me.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.889
Besides,

36:06.921 --> 36:08.923
no one else
wants to fucking talk,

36:08.956 --> 36:11.626
- so why the fuck should I?
- Because there's obviously

36:11.660 --> 36:13.596
something going on.

36:13.628 --> 36:15.363
- So?
- So, I'm your best friend

36:15.396 --> 36:18.266
and I wanna help you.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.635
Yeah, I bet you do.

36:20.668 --> 36:22.637
- Alex.
- I bet you wanna dance in here,

36:22.671 --> 36:24.273
looking all pretty,
and fuck everything up,

36:24.305 --> 36:26.909
and then pretend like
nothing ever happened.

36:26.941 --> 36:28.843
- What the fuck...?
- Well, it did happen!

36:28.876 --> 36:30.478
- It happened!
- What happened?

36:30.512 --> 36:32.615
Leave me alone, don't touch me!

36:34.048 --> 36:37.253
You know what, Alex?

36:37.285 --> 36:39.621
Fuck you.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.857
You know I just wanna help.

36:48.063 --> 36:51.432
Sorry, I can't offer you
anything fun to drink.

36:51.465 --> 36:53.268
That's okay.

36:53.302 --> 36:54.903
Are you all right?

36:54.936 --> 36:57.805
You sounded kind of upset
on the phone.

36:57.838 --> 37:01.543
I didn't invite you
over here to talk.

37:01.575 --> 37:05.813
I am so done talking.

37:05.847 --> 37:07.582
Okay.

37:15.890 --> 37:18.559
Sorry, I thought
that was my cue.

37:18.593 --> 37:19.861
Are you saying, "No"?

37:19.894 --> 37:22.497
No.

37:22.530 --> 37:25.400
Uh.

37:25.434 --> 37:26.901
Just... just wait a minute.

37:26.934 --> 37:28.770
Just a sec.

37:37.713 --> 37:40.916
Okay, so you're saying, "Yes"?

37:40.948 --> 37:44.452
I'm saying, "Just fuck me."

38:22.858 --> 38:25.093
Jesus, I'm coming.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.638
I'm sorry.

38:37.171 --> 38:39.574
I'm sorry.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.510
I'm an asshole.

38:41.543 --> 38:42.845
None of that was meant for you.

38:42.878 --> 38:45.013
Don't ever speak to me
like that again.

38:45.046 --> 38:46.515
Just the whiskey.

38:46.548 --> 38:47.950
I'm serious.

38:50.017 --> 38:52.086
I know, I know.

38:52.119 --> 38:54.756
I'm sorry.

38:54.789 --> 38:56.958
I didn't mean any of it.

39:16.177 --> 39:18.646
What am I going to do with you?

39:20.581 --> 39:22.884
Fix my broken heart.

39:22.918 --> 39:24.986
- What?
- What?

39:25.019 --> 39:27.456
- Why do you have a broken heart?
- Why do you have...?

39:27.488 --> 39:29.490
Alex.

39:33.961 --> 39:35.430
Okay.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.503
Okay, so I am very drunk,

39:41.535 --> 39:43.704
so I think I'm gonna
tell you something right now

39:43.738 --> 39:45.474
that sober Alex
definitely wouldn't tell you

39:45.506 --> 39:47.809
because sober Alex
is scared shitless.

39:47.843 --> 39:49.812
Well, drunk Alex
and sober Alex need to start

39:49.845 --> 39:52.448
trusting their best friend.

39:52.481 --> 39:55.883
They do... I mean, I... I do.

39:55.916 --> 39:59.020
It's nothing to do with
not trusting you.

39:59.053 --> 40:00.889
Then, what is it about?

40:03.992 --> 40:06.061
- I think I need a cigarette.
- Uh, no.

40:08.497 --> 40:10.132
Speak.

40:15.970 --> 40:17.171
You love me, right?

40:17.204 --> 40:19.073
Like...

40:19.106 --> 40:21.610
Like no matter what?

40:21.642 --> 40:24.545
Of course I love you, you idiot.

40:24.579 --> 40:26.582
Nothing you can say
will change that.

40:32.621 --> 40:34.722
Dude, I will help you
bury the body.

40:34.756 --> 40:37.659
I will destroy the evidence.

40:37.691 --> 40:40.661
It honestly can't be that bad.

40:40.695 --> 40:43.731
Whatever it is, man,

40:43.764 --> 40:45.066
it's me.

40:52.740 --> 40:53.976
I'm gay.

41:05.320 --> 41:07.722
Well, I mean, you weren't
hiding that very well.

41:16.731 --> 41:18.800
I'm in love, too.

41:22.070 --> 41:24.673
I'm sorry you were so scared
to tell me that.

41:26.575 --> 41:29.077
I'm so sorry it took me
so long to tell you.

41:29.110 --> 41:31.178
No.

41:31.211 --> 41:32.947
You told me when you were ready.

41:35.749 --> 41:38.019
So, Romeo,

41:38.052 --> 41:40.088
who's the lucky lady?

41:43.592 --> 41:45.059
Are you okay?

41:51.166 --> 41:53.901
- Erin.
- I'm fine.

41:53.934 --> 41:57.338
- If you wanna talk about...
- I don't.

41:57.372 --> 41:59.575
Okay,
just consider this a freebie.

41:59.608 --> 42:01.610
You're off the hook.

42:01.642 --> 42:04.211
What?

42:04.244 --> 42:07.281
Look, I know I may seem
like I'm that kind of guy,

42:07.314 --> 42:09.818
but I'm not that kind of guy.

42:11.653 --> 42:13.221
- Erin.
- Look, Zack,

42:13.253 --> 42:16.023
it doesn't really matter
what kind of guy you are, okay?

42:16.057 --> 42:18.961
Fuck, why is it that when a guy
wants to have casual sex,

42:18.994 --> 42:21.196
it's totally fine,
and when a girl wants to,

42:21.229 --> 42:22.731
there must be a fucking problem.

42:22.764 --> 42:24.765
I never said
there was a problem.

42:24.798 --> 42:26.735
You just seemed upset.

42:26.767 --> 42:28.202
Sorry.

42:28.235 --> 42:30.338
Look, I know
we may have done things

42:30.372 --> 42:34.309
a little backwards here,
but I like you.

42:34.342 --> 42:36.077
- I'd like to...
- No.

42:36.110 --> 42:38.313
- What?
- Whatever you'd like to do

42:38.345 --> 42:40.681
is a fucking terrible idea.

42:40.715 --> 42:42.249
Taking you on a date's
a terrible idea?

42:42.282 --> 42:44.752
- Oh, yeah.
- Why?

42:44.785 --> 42:47.021
Just, fuck, I'm giving you
an easy out here.

42:47.055 --> 42:48.624
I'm not looking for an easy out.

42:48.657 --> 42:52.093
This was just a distraction.

42:52.126 --> 42:53.728
Okay?

42:53.762 --> 42:56.164
This isn't gonna
turn into a whirlwind romance.

42:56.197 --> 42:58.700
It's just sex.

42:58.733 --> 43:01.202
Jesus.

43:01.235 --> 43:03.671
Well,

43:03.704 --> 43:05.306
that's why I don't do this.

43:07.675 --> 43:09.010
Goodnight, Erin.

43:49.483 --> 43:51.786
This is Alex, leave me one.

43:51.820 --> 43:53.354
Alex.

43:55.923 --> 43:57.692
I'm so sorry.

44:21.349 --> 44:23.351
- What happened?
- Ugh, whoa.

44:33.128 --> 44:34.930
Are you gay,
or was that a dream?

44:37.131 --> 44:39.233
Gay.

44:39.267 --> 44:40.836
Not a dream.

44:40.869 --> 44:42.204
Okay.

44:43.972 --> 44:46.807
Cool.

44:48.876 --> 44:50.911
Ugh.

44:50.945 --> 44:52.180
I need a shower.

44:52.213 --> 44:54.850
Mhm.

44:54.883 --> 44:58.086
You stink like a dirty bar.

44:58.119 --> 45:00.088
Yeah.

45:00.121 --> 45:03.224
Probably 'cause
I was at a dirty bar.

45:03.258 --> 45:05.127
Mhm.

45:09.030 --> 45:10.932
Are you okay?

45:13.034 --> 45:15.104
Yeah, I will be.

45:19.039 --> 45:21.744
I love you very, very much.

45:24.211 --> 45:28.249
I have to pee very, very much.

45:37.291 --> 45:39.360
I am so hungover.

45:41.095 --> 45:42.865
It's your own fault.

46:03.383 --> 46:06.021
Erin!

46:15.329 --> 46:18.232
Alex, what are you doing here?

46:18.265 --> 46:19.834
Nice.

46:19.867 --> 46:21.570
- Wait.
- No, you made it quite clear

46:21.602 --> 46:24.238
that you don't want me
to do that.

46:24.271 --> 46:26.440
Why did you call me last night?

46:27.541 --> 46:29.143
Were you...

46:31.012 --> 46:33.849
Were you apologizing
for fucking someone?

46:34.916 --> 46:35.984
I don't know.

46:36.017 --> 46:38.520
I don't know why I called you.

46:38.552 --> 46:40.188
I'm sorry.

46:49.564 --> 46:51.867
What are you doing?

46:53.233 --> 46:55.369
I don't know.

46:55.403 --> 46:57.639
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing.

46:57.671 --> 46:59.573
Okay?

46:59.606 --> 47:01.642
I don't know what this means.

47:03.144 --> 47:04.946
Okay.

47:06.981 --> 47:09.517
I know what it means, okay?

47:09.550 --> 47:11.986
Great, so I'm just
supposed to pretend

47:12.019 --> 47:14.355
like this is normal.

47:14.389 --> 47:16.992
I don't know, Erin.

47:17.025 --> 47:19.327
But I mean,

47:19.360 --> 47:20.495
you should have
some fucking idea

47:20.528 --> 47:22.296
of what you're doing.

47:22.329 --> 47:24.298
Do you give a shit
about me at all?

47:24.331 --> 47:27.134
Yes. Yes.

47:29.369 --> 47:31.005
Okay.

47:33.508 --> 47:37.012
Then how could you have sex
with someone else?

47:38.079 --> 47:40.682
Look, I was just trying to...

47:42.249 --> 47:45.387
I needed to figure out
whether I...

47:45.419 --> 47:47.655
Yeah, okay.

47:49.356 --> 47:52.393
I know what you needed.

47:54.695 --> 47:56.597
Hope you feel better.

47:56.631 --> 47:59.067
It's not like it was
just someone random, Alex.

48:07.742 --> 48:10.678
My God. Making the rounds, huh?

48:10.711 --> 48:13.314
No, wait. Alex...

48:13.347 --> 48:14.615
You know what?

48:14.648 --> 48:19.053
Don't touch me ever again.

48:19.086 --> 48:22.523
And for the record, you can't
fuck yourself straight.

48:31.631 --> 48:33.300
She fucked Zack!

48:36.104 --> 48:37.572
Why the fuck do you care
that I was with Erin?

48:41.209 --> 48:42.677
Alex!

48:44.345 --> 48:45.613
Alex, what the fuck?

48:48.615 --> 48:51.619
You fucked her and she let you
because she's scared!

48:54.488 --> 48:57.057
What the fuck
are you talking about?

49:00.327 --> 49:02.429
I'm in love with her, Zack!

49:02.463 --> 49:04.566
Alex, I didn't... I didn't know.

49:04.599 --> 49:07.202
Yeah, well now you do.

49:25.619 --> 49:27.655
Can I help you?

49:29.456 --> 49:31.425
What are you doing?

49:31.459 --> 49:33.628
What does it look like
I'm doing?

49:38.398 --> 49:41.168
Erin...

49:52.079 --> 49:54.515
Kiss me.

50:14.769 --> 50:17.205
No. No, no. No.

50:17.238 --> 50:19.240
No.

50:19.273 --> 50:20.575
No, I can't wake up
in the morning again

50:20.608 --> 50:22.142
and have you not be there.

50:22.175 --> 50:24.311
I can't be this mistake
that you keep making.

50:24.345 --> 50:28.183
Look, I don't know how to be
with you for real, Alex, so...

50:28.215 --> 50:31.218
You just be with me, Erin.

50:31.251 --> 50:32.586
There's nothing in the way.

50:32.619 --> 50:33.720
I'm all yours.

50:33.753 --> 50:35.522
Yeah.

50:35.555 --> 50:38.559
What am I supposed
to do with that, hm?

50:38.593 --> 50:40.628
I don't know
what to do with that.

50:40.660 --> 50:43.197
And what does that
even mean, Alex?

50:43.231 --> 50:45.867
You don't know
what my life is like.

50:45.900 --> 50:47.802
Okay, so tell me.

50:49.202 --> 50:50.204
Yeah, I fucking can't.

50:52.240 --> 50:55.209
Yeah, so... so that's just it?

50:57.378 --> 50:59.814
God.

50:59.847 --> 51:01.682
You're so fucking void
of emotion

51:01.715 --> 51:03.117
that you can't even see love

51:03.151 --> 51:04.553
when it's staring you
in the face.

51:06.253 --> 51:09.223
God, your dad really did
fuck you up, huh?

51:09.256 --> 51:11.459
Oh!

51:11.492 --> 51:13.628
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

51:13.660 --> 51:17.331
No, I mean, at least
you're feeling something.

51:20.800 --> 51:23.470
Look, I...

51:23.503 --> 51:25.639
Before I met you, I...

51:27.707 --> 51:32.213
I would never have thought
that this would be me, okay?

51:32.246 --> 51:34.715
And I don't know how to...

51:34.749 --> 51:36.451
I don't know
how to process this.

51:36.483 --> 51:40.654
I don't even know
how to begin to process this.

51:40.688 --> 51:44.659
Okay, well,
let's process it together.

51:44.691 --> 51:47.294
I mean, you're not alone
in this.

51:47.327 --> 51:50.797
Julia knows, Zack knows. God.

51:50.831 --> 51:54.302
I mean, who gives a fuck
what anybody else thinks?

51:55.936 --> 51:57.471
You told them?

51:57.505 --> 52:00.608
Yeah, I needed
to talk about it.

52:03.343 --> 52:05.380
Okay, Erin,
I know that you're scared.

52:05.412 --> 52:08.182
I know that this...

52:08.215 --> 52:09.550
...that this derailed you a bit

52:09.584 --> 52:11.186
and it took you by surprise,

52:11.218 --> 52:14.289
but you can't pretend
like this doesn't exist.

52:14.322 --> 52:17.624
Hmm, I, uh, I wish
that you'd met somebody else

52:17.657 --> 52:19.293
that night on the dance floor

52:19.327 --> 52:21.662
and I wish that she could
give you what you need

52:21.695 --> 52:23.464
because I can't.

52:25.465 --> 52:28.936
That's how you feel?
You wish you'd never met me?

52:32.506 --> 52:34.676
Say something!

52:36.876 --> 52:38.445
Fine.

52:38.479 --> 52:41.216
Fine, uh, right,
you want me to forget.

52:41.249 --> 52:42.784
Sure, let's forget,
let's put it all behind us,

52:42.816 --> 52:45.753
one big fucked up mistake.

52:45.785 --> 52:48.423
I can't believe you told them.

52:49.624 --> 52:52.227
Yeah, well, I had to!

52:52.260 --> 52:55.729
I can't just bury this
like you can!

52:55.762 --> 52:57.731
God, it's like...

52:57.764 --> 53:00.667
It's like you... you're living
in this fantasy land

53:00.700 --> 53:02.403
where you think you can fuck
whoever you want

53:02.436 --> 53:03.938
and not have to worry
about the consequences.

53:03.970 --> 53:07.474
It's like you don't think
any of this is real.

53:07.508 --> 53:08.543
Huh.

53:08.575 --> 53:10.911
Whether we talk about it or not,

53:10.945 --> 53:12.981
and whether people
know about it or not,

53:13.014 --> 53:15.282
the way that you're feeling
is fucking real, Erin,

53:15.316 --> 53:16.684
it's real!

53:25.358 --> 53:27.794
That's the part that scares me.

53:27.827 --> 53:29.496
Alex.

53:29.530 --> 53:31.466
It's my feelings.

53:31.499 --> 53:33.368
Okay, how am I supposed
to just one day decide

53:33.401 --> 53:34.969
that I like women?

53:35.001 --> 53:37.738
It wasn't a decision, Erin.

53:37.771 --> 53:41.008
It was a realization.

53:41.041 --> 53:42.809
It's always been there.

53:42.843 --> 53:44.045
You've just been hiding

53:44.077 --> 53:45.813
this part of yourself
for so long.

53:45.845 --> 53:48.416
Erin, this is... this is
who you are.

53:48.448 --> 53:51.785
This is who you've always been
before you ever even met me.

53:51.818 --> 53:53.387
No.

53:55.356 --> 53:57.792
Look, I'm here, okay?

53:57.825 --> 53:59.060
I'm here.

53:59.093 --> 54:02.630
We can do all of this together.

54:02.662 --> 54:06.066
Just... just let me love you.

54:08.968 --> 54:11.673
Sorry, but this just isn't me.

54:13.374 --> 54:15.843
Please, Erin.

54:15.876 --> 54:17.678
No, this isn't me.

54:17.711 --> 54:21.481
- No, come here.
- Don't touch me.

54:21.514 --> 54:23.417
I'm sorry I came here today.

54:24.985 --> 54:26.887
Do you love me?

54:26.921 --> 54:30.058
Yeah, it doesn't fucking matter,
does it?

54:40.034 --> 54:42.537
I come in peace.

54:46.139 --> 54:48.075
How's your face?

54:48.108 --> 54:49.943
You punched it. It hurts.

54:56.983 --> 55:00.954
Oh, uh, this is my cue.

55:03.490 --> 55:06.360
Don't fucking wreck the place.

55:16.771 --> 55:18.973
I'm really sorry.

55:21.409 --> 55:24.646
I was just so mad.

55:26.012 --> 55:28.982
Yeah, I got that part.

55:30.785 --> 55:32.687
You didn't deserve that, though.

55:34.053 --> 55:35.021
You're right.

55:35.055 --> 55:36.524
I didn't.

55:40.961 --> 55:45.033
I'm also sorry because I know
that you were into her first.

55:47.168 --> 55:50.704
I don't think
our feelings compare.

55:50.738 --> 55:54.041
I had no idea.
You know that, right?

55:54.073 --> 55:56.077
Yeah. Of course.

55:56.110 --> 55:57.577
Of course I know that.

55:57.610 --> 56:00.647
It was just
one of those things.

56:00.680 --> 56:03.117
It was late. We were drunk.

56:03.150 --> 56:05.686
- She told me to...
- Okay.

56:05.718 --> 56:09.624
No, I don't need
any of those details.

56:09.657 --> 56:12.126
My imagination is on overdrive
as it is.

56:12.159 --> 56:13.994
Sorry.

56:14.028 --> 56:15.530
If it makes you feel
any better,

56:15.563 --> 56:18.633
I don't think I rocked her world
or anything.

56:18.666 --> 56:21.535
It doesn't make me feel
any better.

56:21.568 --> 56:23.704
Are you okay?

56:25.939 --> 56:28.108
No.

56:28.142 --> 56:29.844
I'm not.

56:41.822 --> 56:43.992
We're closed.

56:49.262 --> 56:51.665
So...

56:51.698 --> 56:53.733
Riddle me this.

56:53.767 --> 56:57.705
I've now found
both of you separately

56:57.738 --> 57:00.140
in your respective places
at work

57:00.173 --> 57:04.111
getting drunk alone
over each other.

57:06.713 --> 57:08.248
I don't know what
you're talking about.

57:09.749 --> 57:11.084
Okay.

57:11.117 --> 57:12.619
If we're gonna get drunk
in a cafe,

57:12.653 --> 57:15.657
let's have some class,
shall we?

57:37.177 --> 57:39.046
To Alex.

57:49.155 --> 57:51.692
So let's have a chat.

57:53.626 --> 57:55.929
I can wait all day.

58:00.166 --> 58:02.135
You don't fucking get it.

58:03.938 --> 58:09.075
Okay, do you have any idea
what my father would say?

58:09.108 --> 58:12.112
Or even worse,
what he would think?

58:14.180 --> 58:18.218
I couldn't be affectionate
with her in public.

58:18.251 --> 58:22.222
People would be looking at us
and making comments.

58:23.890 --> 58:28.162
I don't know
how to make this work, Jules.

58:31.097 --> 58:32.166
And I don't know
how to love her

58:32.198 --> 58:34.834
without hurting her.

58:36.836 --> 58:39.273
I didn't realize
that the entire world

58:39.305 --> 58:42.108
had such a big influence
on who you love.

58:46.146 --> 58:48.783
I'm sorry, Jules.

58:50.284 --> 58:51.718
I know what
I've put her through,

58:51.751 --> 58:53.887
but I just... I just can't
fucking do it.

58:53.921 --> 58:56.957
- I can't.
- Then let her go.

58:59.660 --> 59:02.129
How's Zack?

59:02.162 --> 59:04.198
Which part?

59:04.231 --> 59:07.635
His feelings, his ego,
or his nose?

59:07.668 --> 59:10.604
His nose?

59:10.637 --> 59:12.139
Oh, God, did Alex...

59:12.171 --> 59:14.976
Fuck, I'm such
a fucking asshole.

59:15.008 --> 59:17.378
Yeah, I mean,
you could've worked out

59:17.410 --> 59:20.847
your internalized homophobia
literally any other way.

59:20.881 --> 59:22.283
Jules...

59:22.316 --> 59:24.785
Listen...

59:24.818 --> 59:28.789
I know you're going through
a lot of shit right now,

59:28.822 --> 59:31.092
but try not to drag
the people you care about

59:31.124 --> 59:34.061
through the shit with you.

59:34.093 --> 59:35.729
I'm sorry.

59:36.963 --> 59:38.865
I know two other people
who deserve that

59:38.898 --> 59:39.967
much more than I do right now.

59:42.669 --> 59:45.238
I'll see you at school, okay?

01:00:11.064 --> 01:00:15.702
No, it was seriously inside
the lettuce bag.

01:00:15.735 --> 01:00:16.903
Sorry. I'm sorry, what?

01:00:19.039 --> 01:00:22.176
Yeah, no, I'm serious.

01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:24.211
You ever think they're gonna
close this place down?

01:00:24.244 --> 01:00:27.081
No. Julia. That's blasphemy.

01:00:27.113 --> 01:00:29.684
Well, seriously,
you can't work here forever.

01:00:29.717 --> 01:00:31.017
What are you gonna do
when you graduate?

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:33.220
Oh, I need to graduate first.

01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:36.090
Pardon me?

01:00:36.122 --> 01:00:38.391
I have this killer stats class.

01:00:38.425 --> 01:00:40.260
I don't think
I'm gonna survive it.

01:00:40.293 --> 01:00:42.896
Ooh, I have a friend.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.865
I'm so proud of you.

01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:46.133
Shut up.

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:47.735
No, she's a science major.

01:00:47.767 --> 01:00:50.271
She TAs a lot and loves stats.

01:00:50.303 --> 01:00:51.972
I'll ask her to tutor you.

01:00:52.005 --> 01:00:53.740
That makes me sound
like a real winner.

01:00:53.773 --> 01:00:55.375
Alex, it's okay to ask for help

01:00:55.409 --> 01:00:58.746
when you don't understand
something.

01:01:00.814 --> 01:01:02.349
Help.

01:01:02.381 --> 01:01:05.052
Ugh.

01:01:05.084 --> 01:01:08.354
Let her do what she's gonna do.

01:01:08.387 --> 01:01:13.059
She's gonna walk into my bar
with some dude.

01:01:13.093 --> 01:01:15.129
It's not your problem.

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:21.102
Well...

01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:22.270
I never thought I'd say this,

01:01:22.302 --> 01:01:26.439
but I think I should go study
before I get too drunk.

01:01:26.472 --> 01:01:28.875
Music to my ears.

01:01:28.909 --> 01:01:30.144
Funny.

01:01:30.177 --> 01:01:31.879
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:39.186
Hi.

01:01:39.218 --> 01:01:40.354
What are you doing?

01:01:40.387 --> 01:01:41.921
Um, saying hi.

01:01:41.954 --> 01:01:44.057
In Alex's bar with a guy?

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.291
He's my boyfriend.

01:01:45.325 --> 01:01:47.828
Super.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.130
Just trying to move on
with my life, Julia.

01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:51.765
Wouldn't it be interesting

01:01:51.798 --> 01:01:54.034
if instead of moving on
with your life,

01:01:54.066 --> 01:01:55.969
you actually just lived it?

01:01:56.003 --> 01:01:57.071
I just came to say hi.

01:01:57.104 --> 01:01:59.140
I'm not looking for a lecture.

01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:00.941
Have you talked to somebody?

01:02:00.974 --> 01:02:03.309
Like a counselor?

01:02:03.343 --> 01:02:05.813
Okay, I'm gonna go get back
to my date.

01:02:05.845 --> 01:02:07.247
Oh, he's your date now.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.182
I thought he was
your boyfriend.

01:02:09.215 --> 01:02:11.317
Yeah, um, well, he's...

01:02:11.351 --> 01:02:13.253
A man.

01:02:13.287 --> 01:02:17.892
Which is the only part
that actually matters, right?

01:02:17.925 --> 01:02:20.361
Listen, just talk to somebody.

01:02:20.394 --> 01:02:22.196
This is not your life.

01:02:22.229 --> 01:02:23.831
It's not who you are.

01:02:29.936 --> 01:02:32.572
Hey, are you Alex?

01:02:32.606 --> 01:02:34.475
Uh, yeah.

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:38.445
Billie.

01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:43.217
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:43.249 --> 01:02:45.485
Julia texted me and told me
to meet you in the library.

01:02:45.519 --> 01:02:47.188
She said that you needed
a tutor.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.890
And you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

01:02:50.923 --> 01:02:53.893
Ah, no, yes, I do, I do.

01:02:53.927 --> 01:02:55.229
God, she acts fast.

01:02:55.262 --> 01:02:57.363
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

01:02:57.396 --> 01:02:58.398
Yes, please.

01:02:58.432 --> 01:03:00.334
Uh, save me from the numbers.

01:03:00.367 --> 01:03:02.570
Okay, so where are you at?

01:03:02.602 --> 01:03:07.173
Well, I'm somewhere between

01:03:07.206 --> 01:03:09.943
I have no idea what I'm doing
and I want to quit school.

01:03:09.977 --> 01:03:12.146
Okay, look,

01:03:12.178 --> 01:03:15.883
I find it easier
to write out the whole formula.

01:03:25.626 --> 01:03:28.229
Does that make sense?

01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:31.030
Uh, yeah.

01:03:31.064 --> 01:03:32.533
Yeah, I think... I think it does.

01:04:14.707 --> 01:04:16.577
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:20.113
Wait. Why do you think
you've made a mistake?

01:04:22.115 --> 01:04:23.317
I... I...

01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:27.287
Just come in and listen,
meet some people.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.655
I wouldn't know what to say.

01:04:28.689 --> 01:04:30.257
You don't have to say anything.

01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:32.358
You can even sit in the back
if you want to.

01:04:32.392 --> 01:04:35.629
It's at your own pace,
and there's free coffee.

01:04:35.662 --> 01:04:37.398
I don't have to say anything?

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:38.499
Nothing.

01:04:38.532 --> 01:04:39.633
- Just listen?
- Mm-hm.

01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:46.974
Okay.

01:05:04.992 --> 01:05:06.427
Um...

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:10.164
Did you...

01:05:10.197 --> 01:05:13.166
Did you want
to get a drink with me?

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.234
Right now?

01:05:14.267 --> 01:05:16.203
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:16.235 --> 01:05:18.671
Actually, I know
the perfect place.

01:05:24.043 --> 01:05:25.345
Hello?

01:05:28.514 --> 01:05:30.516
Billie?

01:05:54.307 --> 01:05:56.410
Hello?

01:05:56.443 --> 01:05:59.046
Sorry, I was getting us
refreshments.

01:05:59.079 --> 01:06:01.481
This place is crazy.

01:06:01.514 --> 01:06:03.082
I know, it's pretty great,
right?

01:06:03.115 --> 01:06:05.151
- Do you work here?
- No,

01:06:05.184 --> 01:06:09.389
I just live in the basement
waiting for my Christine.

01:06:09.423 --> 01:06:11.125
Not a theater person?

01:06:11.157 --> 01:06:13.459
Oh, no, not at all.

01:06:13.492 --> 01:06:14.695
Phantom of the Opera?

01:06:14.727 --> 01:06:16.563
Oh, I know that one.

01:06:28.508 --> 01:06:30.511
- So, did we just break in?
- Technically, yes,

01:06:30.543 --> 01:06:33.646
but I have a key,
so they can't prove anything.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.648
I'm friends with the manager.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.717
He owed me a beer.

01:06:36.749 --> 01:06:38.217
What about you?

01:06:38.251 --> 01:06:40.053
Tell me all about Alex.

01:06:40.086 --> 01:06:43.423
- What are your aspirations?
- Business school.

01:06:43.456 --> 01:06:45.825
- That's sexy.
- Thank you.

01:06:45.858 --> 01:06:48.461
Um, I want to start
my own business.

01:06:48.494 --> 01:06:50.830
- Ooh, that's ambitious.
- Yeah, I mean, I work

01:06:50.863 --> 01:06:52.365
at this little dive bar
across town

01:06:52.398 --> 01:06:54.300
and we have regulars

01:06:54.334 --> 01:06:56.370
and everybody knows
everybody else,

01:06:56.403 --> 01:07:00.407
and it's just this, you know,
chill, safe place

01:07:00.439 --> 01:07:03.443
for people to hang out
and, I don't know,

01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:05.079
I just want to create
something like that.

01:07:05.111 --> 01:07:07.247
Like a dyke bar.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.348
Are you okay?

01:07:11.284 --> 01:07:13.186
- Yeah.
- Have you never heard

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:15.789
the word "dyke" before?

01:07:15.822 --> 01:07:17.524
I mean, not in that context.

01:07:17.557 --> 01:07:19.693
What? Where have you been?

01:07:19.726 --> 01:07:21.095
Uh, in the closet.

01:07:21.128 --> 01:07:23.729
Oh, Alex.

01:07:23.762 --> 01:07:26.432
Have you never been
to a gay bar?

01:07:26.465 --> 01:07:27.601
I have not.

01:07:27.633 --> 01:07:29.802
Okay, it is official.

01:07:29.836 --> 01:07:34.140
I am now your tutor in stats
and in being gay.

01:07:36.209 --> 01:07:39.213
And I have a confession to make.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.382
- It's okay.
- You don't even know

01:07:42.414 --> 01:07:45.384
what I was gonna say.

01:07:45.418 --> 01:07:49.222
That Julia purposefully asked
her lesbian friend

01:07:49.256 --> 01:07:52.126
who happens to be good at stats
to tutor me

01:07:52.159 --> 01:07:53.827
in hopes of us
hitting it off.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.329
So, did we?

01:07:56.363 --> 01:07:58.565
Well, I followed you
into a deserted theater,

01:07:58.597 --> 01:08:02.570
so, uh, I would say yes.

01:08:05.604 --> 01:08:07.675
Do you want to follow me
somewhere else?

01:08:10.843 --> 01:08:12.445
How was that for you?

01:08:12.479 --> 01:08:15.448
- Overwhelming.
- That's okay.

01:08:15.481 --> 01:08:17.750
Do you think you might
want to come back?

01:08:17.783 --> 01:08:20.319
Possibly.

01:08:20.353 --> 01:08:22.622
Are you a one-word woman?

01:08:22.656 --> 01:08:26.859
I don't know,
I just never really...

01:08:26.893 --> 01:08:28.629
That's okay.

01:08:28.661 --> 01:08:30.596
It's baby steps.

01:08:30.629 --> 01:08:32.698
You can sit at the back
as long as you like.

01:08:32.732 --> 01:08:33.901
I mean, you can even sit
on the floor

01:08:33.933 --> 01:08:36.301
if you really want to.

01:08:39.572 --> 01:08:42.242
How do you know when to...

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:46.312
I think there
just comes a point

01:08:46.345 --> 01:08:50.350
where it's harder to not say it
than to say it.

01:08:52.818 --> 01:08:56.356
I don't even know
how to say it to myself.

01:08:56.388 --> 01:08:58.758
Well, then that's
a really good place to start

01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:00.660
because the only person
who really matters

01:09:00.693 --> 01:09:02.962
in all of this is you.

01:09:04.464 --> 01:09:06.767
So you've never
been here before?

01:09:06.799 --> 01:09:10.469
No. No, I didn't know
this place existed.

01:09:10.502 --> 01:09:12.973
Or that there were
other lesbians in town.

01:09:13.005 --> 01:09:16.410
Oh, honey, you just wait.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:22.747
Hey.

01:09:22.781 --> 01:09:24.817
You don't have to hide anymore.

01:09:39.665 --> 01:09:41.968
Thank you for not pushing me.

01:09:42.001 --> 01:09:43.636
We're all here
for whenever you're ready

01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:45.272
to find your voice.

01:09:45.304 --> 01:09:46.606
I know it's in there.

01:09:46.639 --> 01:09:48.374
Trust it.

01:09:48.407 --> 01:09:50.977
- I'm really scared.
- And that's okay.

01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:54.281
That probably won't go away
anytime soon.

01:09:54.313 --> 01:09:56.582
But I promise that when you do
find those words,

01:09:56.616 --> 01:09:58.318
everything will change.

01:10:06.593 --> 01:10:07.760
You know, I appreciate
the respect,

01:10:07.794 --> 01:10:10.497
but you can touch me.

01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:15.501
- You are so cute.
- I'm nervous.

01:10:15.535 --> 01:10:18.372
We don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

01:10:18.405 --> 01:10:19.939
No, I'm good.

01:10:19.973 --> 01:10:21.875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:10:28.615 --> 01:10:30.416
- So, you have fun, then?
- Yes!

01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:32.352
Oh my God, I want to go there
every week.

01:10:32.384 --> 01:10:33.352
It was incredible.

01:10:33.385 --> 01:10:34.787
- It felt so...
- Free?

01:10:34.821 --> 01:10:36.290
Yes!

01:10:36.322 --> 01:10:38.392
Like nobody cared
what you were doing

01:10:38.424 --> 01:10:40.059
- or who you were doing it with.
- Yeah, it's called

01:10:40.093 --> 01:10:42.696
being inclusive
and non-judgmental.

01:10:42.728 --> 01:10:45.064
Right, yeah, guess I haven't
really experienced

01:10:45.098 --> 01:10:46.300
all that much of that.

01:10:46.332 --> 01:10:48.669
Ugh, that makes me really sad.

01:10:48.701 --> 01:10:50.070
But it's probably because

01:10:50.103 --> 01:10:51.405
you've only ever been
to straight clubs

01:10:51.437 --> 01:10:54.407
and you can't be yourself.

01:10:54.441 --> 01:10:57.077
Anyway, this is me.

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:59.612
Oh, well, thanks.

01:10:59.646 --> 01:11:01.048
I had a really good time
tonight.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.348
Good.

01:11:02.381 --> 01:11:04.485
We should do this again
sometime.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.689
Do you want to come up?

01:11:10.055 --> 01:11:11.857
Like to your apartment?

01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:14.494
Like to my bedroom?

01:11:17.129 --> 01:11:19.432
Oh.

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:23.704
What happens next?

01:11:23.737 --> 01:11:25.605
Whatever you want.

01:11:41.153 --> 01:11:43.557
So, what's going on?

01:11:44.957 --> 01:11:46.727
Sorry.

01:11:48.728 --> 01:11:50.430
I just...

01:11:50.463 --> 01:11:53.599
I needed to talk to you
and I wanted to do it alone

01:11:53.633 --> 01:11:57.871
without your backup,
so thanks for coming over.

01:11:57.903 --> 01:12:00.107
You know,
she's probably watching.

01:12:00.139 --> 01:12:02.375
She's everywhere.

01:12:02.409 --> 01:12:03.777
Yeah.

01:12:05.144 --> 01:12:08.013
So what do you need to say?

01:12:08.046 --> 01:12:09.715
I'm sorry.

01:12:11.084 --> 01:12:14.988
I guess that's
pretty long overdue.

01:12:15.021 --> 01:12:18.759
I just didn't really have
the courage before now.

01:12:18.791 --> 01:12:20.393
But I'm not gonna make excuses.

01:12:20.427 --> 01:12:22.661
I...

01:12:22.695 --> 01:12:25.732
That night that we, uh...

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.001
Yeah.

01:12:28.034 --> 01:12:30.871
Look, what I did,

01:12:30.903 --> 01:12:34.140
what I said, it was wrong,

01:12:34.174 --> 01:12:36.042
and I'm sorry.

01:12:36.075 --> 01:12:37.911
You didn't deserve that.

01:12:37.943 --> 01:12:39.780
I was a dick.

01:12:39.812 --> 01:12:41.180
Wow.

01:12:41.214 --> 01:12:43.582
Um...

01:12:43.616 --> 01:12:45.051
Thank you.

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:47.019
I appreciate it

01:12:47.053 --> 01:12:48.921
because you were a dick.

01:12:50.522 --> 01:12:54.860
But I should've asked
more questions.

01:12:54.893 --> 01:12:57.930
I knew something was up.

01:12:57.964 --> 01:13:00.167
So, I'm sorry too.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.803
You needed a friend,
not a quickie.

01:13:04.237 --> 01:13:07.007
I would take a friend, though.

01:13:08.607 --> 01:13:09.909
You got it.

01:13:13.112 --> 01:13:15.482
You're such a nerd.

01:13:17.584 --> 01:13:18.652
- Hey.
- Hi!

01:13:20.987 --> 01:13:23.523
So, uh, last night...

01:13:23.555 --> 01:13:26.125
Was fun and spontaneous.

01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:28.995
Absolutely, uh,

01:13:29.027 --> 01:13:30.763
and I think that we should
talk about it.

01:13:30.796 --> 01:13:32.933
Sure!

01:13:32.965 --> 01:13:34.468
Okay.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.035
Okay, so we, um...

01:13:36.068 --> 01:13:38.071
- Had sex.
- Yes.

01:13:38.103 --> 01:13:40.506
And, uh...

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.842
What does that mean?

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:45.011
It means that we had sex.

01:13:45.044 --> 01:13:46.646
Right. Right, right.

01:13:46.679 --> 01:13:48.882
But... but what does that...
what does that mean?

01:13:48.915 --> 01:13:51.551
Like, um, like, are we dating?

01:13:51.584 --> 01:13:53.954
Uh, are you my girlfriend?

01:13:53.987 --> 01:13:56.723
- Uh...
- Do we talk about it?

01:13:56.755 --> 01:13:57.957
Do you not want
to talk about it?

01:13:57.991 --> 01:14:00.894
Okay, okay, okay,
you are so cute.

01:14:00.927 --> 01:14:03.563
Okay, first of all,
we can talk about everything

01:14:03.595 --> 01:14:05.698
and anything, okay?

01:14:05.732 --> 01:14:07.000
And, secondly, I think

01:14:07.032 --> 01:14:09.503
that you might be panicking
a little.

01:14:09.536 --> 01:14:12.539
We had sex last night
and it doesn't have to be

01:14:12.571 --> 01:14:14.106
anything more than that.

01:14:14.139 --> 01:14:15.976
- It doesn't?
- No.

01:14:16.009 --> 01:14:19.713
Two people can find each other
attractive and just have sex.

01:14:19.745 --> 01:14:23.115
I mean, do you want
a relationship?

01:14:23.148 --> 01:14:27.019
No, I don't, actually.

01:14:27.053 --> 01:14:29.155
Okay, so are we
just friends, then?

01:14:29.187 --> 01:14:30.689
Absolutely.

01:14:30.723 --> 01:14:33.793
And we can be
whatever we want to be.

01:14:33.826 --> 01:14:35.829
Does that work for you?

01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:38.031
Yes, that works for me.

01:14:39.765 --> 01:14:41.101
I still really need a tutor,
though.

01:14:41.134 --> 01:14:43.670
Yeah, you do really need
a tutor.

01:14:45.604 --> 01:14:47.107
Okay, where are you at today?

01:14:47.139 --> 01:14:49.608
Oh my God, not much further
than I was last time.

01:14:49.642 --> 01:14:51.044
What is this?

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.050
You know, you don't
have to knock every time.

01:14:58.084 --> 01:15:00.253
I wasn't really sure
if I was gonna go in.

01:15:00.286 --> 01:15:02.289
Well, you showed up,
so that's a good start.

01:15:02.321 --> 01:15:04.256
- Is it?
- Do you want to hang out here,

01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:06.092
or you can follow me in?

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:09.262
I'll pretend not to notice.

01:15:09.295 --> 01:15:12.198
I guess I can keep
the back row warm.

01:15:12.231 --> 01:15:14.067
You're very kind.

01:15:19.938 --> 01:15:23.209
Here we have
your premium back row seat.

01:15:29.781 --> 01:15:32.052
Hey, how's it going? Thank you.

01:15:37.924 --> 01:15:39.192
Hello, everyone.

01:15:39.224 --> 01:15:42.294
Thank you so much
for coming tonight.

01:15:42.327 --> 01:15:44.764
Would anyone like
to start us off?

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.936
I would.

01:15:49.969 --> 01:15:52.306
Awesome. Please do.

01:16:02.048 --> 01:16:03.148
Should I stand up?

01:16:03.182 --> 01:16:05.152
You can do whatever you want.

01:16:15.094 --> 01:16:16.196
Okay.

01:16:16.228 --> 01:16:18.063
Um...

01:16:18.097 --> 01:16:20.265
So I'm Erin.

01:16:20.299 --> 01:16:22.235
And, uh...

01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:27.206
This is all very new for me.

01:16:29.008 --> 01:16:30.943
I guess I've never
really allowed myself

01:16:30.977 --> 01:16:34.147
to feel these feelings before...

01:16:39.852 --> 01:16:41.220
...until I met this person

01:16:41.254 --> 01:16:44.290
that shifted my entire outlook
on the world

01:16:44.322 --> 01:16:46.726
and on everything.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.063
I tried really hard to bury it,

01:16:51.097 --> 01:16:55.835
but I just haven't been able
to keep ignoring it.

01:16:59.738 --> 01:17:04.878
I tried so hard to not,
you know, to not be...

01:17:06.978 --> 01:17:08.682
You know...

01:17:10.383 --> 01:17:12.986
God, I'm scared.

01:17:13.018 --> 01:17:17.956
I'm so fucking scared.

01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:21.995
And I just haven't been able
to even say the words or...

01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:28.333
...or be able to even really

01:17:28.366 --> 01:17:32.438
let myself be this way.

01:17:36.776 --> 01:17:38.111
And I just can't
do this anymore.

01:17:38.143 --> 01:17:39.713
And...

01:17:42.314 --> 01:17:45.751
I've never been able
to admit this, but I just...

01:17:47.487 --> 01:17:49.456
God, I feel like
I'm suffocating.

01:17:49.488 --> 01:17:52.424
I feel like I can't breathe...

01:17:54.059 --> 01:17:58.363
...like I can't keep up
this lie anymore, and...

01:18:00.433 --> 01:18:02.902
I think this is it.

01:18:02.934 --> 01:18:07.874
I think this is it, I think
this is my coming out story.

01:18:07.906 --> 01:18:09.875
Right now.

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.349
So, I, uh...

01:18:22.287 --> 01:18:23.923
...can't keep
doing this anymore,

01:18:23.955 --> 01:18:27.793
so I'm gonna... I'm gonna
finally say this.

01:18:31.363 --> 01:18:33.299
I'm gay.

01:18:42.441 --> 01:18:43.943
I'm gay.

01:18:45.210 --> 01:18:47.446
Do you have a Jack?

01:18:47.479 --> 01:18:50.150
Read 'em and weep,
motherfuckers.

01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:52.318
I win again.

01:18:52.351 --> 01:18:53.786
I think you're making up
the rules.

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.854
It's bullshit.

01:18:55.888 --> 01:18:57.957
Hey, y'all should be
used to it by now.

01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:59.992
I win every time.

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:03.062
I live in hope.

01:19:03.094 --> 01:19:04.496
Hey, get me more beer, please.

01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:06.331
Beer, yes, definitely.

01:19:10.369 --> 01:19:15.474
So, any more sexy time
rendezvous with Billie lately?

01:19:17.043 --> 01:19:19.379
Maybe.

01:19:19.411 --> 01:19:21.380
No, you know, this is actually
a really cool feeling,

01:19:21.414 --> 01:19:24.951
not being heartbroken,
no obligations,

01:19:24.983 --> 01:19:26.919
not worrying about Erin.

01:19:28.353 --> 01:19:29.923
I think I finally feel
like myself, you know,

01:19:29.955 --> 01:19:32.191
like who I'm supposed to be.

01:19:32.224 --> 01:19:33.425
Does that make sense?

01:19:33.459 --> 01:19:36.162
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

01:19:36.195 --> 01:19:38.097
I'm happy for you.

01:19:40.031 --> 01:19:41.601
- All right, there you go.
- Yes.

01:19:41.634 --> 01:19:43.369
Wait, that's yours.

01:19:44.903 --> 01:19:47.607
I don't trust you.
I want that one.

01:19:47.639 --> 01:19:50.410
- No.
- What do you mean?

01:19:50.442 --> 01:19:52.077
You did something, I know it.

01:19:52.111 --> 01:19:53.580
Cheers, cheers.

01:19:53.612 --> 01:19:56.348
Drink your own spit.

01:20:13.933 --> 01:20:16.069
Hi.

01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:17.903
What are you doing here?

01:20:17.937 --> 01:20:20.273
I needed to talk to you.

01:20:20.305 --> 01:20:22.442
Wow, well, you could call me.

01:20:22.474 --> 01:20:25.344
I needed to see you as well.

01:20:28.647 --> 01:20:31.383
What's going on, Erin?
It's late.

01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:32.451
I missed you.

01:20:32.485 --> 01:20:35.921
Mm, okay.

01:20:35.955 --> 01:20:37.591
Are you drunk?

01:20:40.492 --> 01:20:43.463
Okay, come on. Come on.

01:20:59.978 --> 01:21:01.647
Okay, what's up?

01:21:06.518 --> 01:21:09.521
No, no, no, no.

01:21:09.554 --> 01:21:11.189
No.

01:21:16.594 --> 01:21:18.597
Just listen to me
for a minute, please,

01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:21.467
'cause there's something
that I need to say.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.336
Okay.

01:21:26.171 --> 01:21:29.241
I've been thinking and learning
a lot about myself,

01:21:29.275 --> 01:21:33.312
and I came here tonight
because...

01:21:34.647 --> 01:21:37.317
...because,

01:21:37.349 --> 01:21:41.120
because I needed
to tell you something.

01:21:44.089 --> 01:21:48.226
I needed to tell you
that I figured it out.

01:21:48.259 --> 01:21:50.495
Figured what out?

01:21:50.528 --> 01:21:53.131
That I can't hide anymore.

01:21:53.165 --> 01:21:54.500
I can't hide who I am.

01:21:54.532 --> 01:21:57.536
I came out today
to complete strangers

01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.106
and it felt really good.

01:22:01.773 --> 01:22:03.675
I realized that
this entire time

01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:07.213
I thought that I was afraid
of you and of us,

01:22:07.245 --> 01:22:09.681
but really,
I was just afraid of things

01:22:09.714 --> 01:22:11.351
that I couldn't control.

01:22:11.384 --> 01:22:12.685
So I'm ready. I'm ready.

01:22:12.718 --> 01:22:16.356
I'm ready for... for us.

01:22:16.388 --> 01:22:19.092
I'm ready for you to give me

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:20.360
all the things
you wanted to give me.

01:22:20.393 --> 01:22:22.762
I'm ready for you to love me.

01:22:26.432 --> 01:22:28.067
Wow.

01:22:29.602 --> 01:22:32.738
Um, that took a lot.

01:22:34.139 --> 01:22:36.342
I know that.

01:22:36.375 --> 01:22:38.044
But you can't expect
that we can just pick up

01:22:38.076 --> 01:22:39.711
like nothing happened.

01:22:39.745 --> 01:22:42.148
No, I know, I know. I, um,

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:47.186
I was really selfish
and unfair,

01:22:47.219 --> 01:22:49.622
and I'm so sorry.

01:22:49.655 --> 01:22:52.125
And if you'll just, uh,

01:22:52.157 --> 01:22:55.327
if you'll just let me
prove to you that I...

01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:59.098
Erin, I'm not looking
for an apology, okay?

01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:00.732
And I'm not saying this
to try and punish you.

01:23:00.765 --> 01:23:04.070
I'm genuinely happy for you.

01:23:04.103 --> 01:23:05.204
Okay.

01:23:05.237 --> 01:23:07.740
So give me another chance.

01:23:07.772 --> 01:23:10.809
No, it's... it's not about
giving you another chance.

01:23:10.843 --> 01:23:12.577
Okay, then what is it?

01:23:12.611 --> 01:23:14.280
What is it about?

01:23:18.416 --> 01:23:21.286
It's been months, Erin.

01:23:23.089 --> 01:23:27.427
You haven't spoken to me
in months.

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:28.628
Okay?

01:23:30.129 --> 01:23:32.497
A lot has changed.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.736
But you still love me, right?

01:23:40.638 --> 01:23:43.342
This is what you wanted!

01:23:43.375 --> 01:23:44.744
I am giving you
what you wanted.

01:23:44.777 --> 01:23:47.180
No, I wanted you
to be yourself.

01:23:47.213 --> 01:23:49.182
For you.

01:23:49.214 --> 01:23:51.784
You've taken this amazing step.

01:23:51.817 --> 01:23:54.687
But you need to do it for you,

01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:56.421
not because you think
it's what I want.

01:23:56.455 --> 01:23:58.224
I mean, I'm not the one
who suffers here.

01:23:58.256 --> 01:24:01.227
If you can't accept yourself...

01:24:01.259 --> 01:24:02.494
I've been down that road.

01:24:02.527 --> 01:24:03.695
I'm not...

01:24:03.728 --> 01:24:06.098
I can't do that again.

01:24:07.532 --> 01:24:09.634
I don't understand.

01:24:09.668 --> 01:24:12.772
I don't understand,
I thought that you'd be happy.

01:24:12.804 --> 01:24:16.741
I thought that you would be...

01:24:18.376 --> 01:24:19.411
Waiting for you?

01:24:27.286 --> 01:24:28.121
Oh my God.

01:24:29.687 --> 01:24:31.389
Oh my God.

01:24:34.759 --> 01:24:36.862
I can't breathe.

01:24:39.464 --> 01:24:41.700
I don't know what to do.

01:24:43.768 --> 01:24:45.570
I...

01:24:45.603 --> 01:24:49.207
I need you, I can't do this
without you.

01:24:49.241 --> 01:24:50.776
I don't know how to do this
without you.

01:24:53.912 --> 01:24:56.314
It's okay.

01:24:56.348 --> 01:24:57.750
It's
okay.

01:24:59.751 --> 01:25:01.687
It's okay.

01:25:03.388 --> 01:25:05.624
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.742
Good morning.

01:25:23.776 --> 01:25:25.811
Did you sleep on the couch?

01:25:25.844 --> 01:25:26.746
Yeah.

01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:31.551
Thanks.

01:25:31.584 --> 01:25:33.653
How are you?

01:25:36.688 --> 01:25:39.424
Embarrassed.

01:25:39.457 --> 01:25:42.228
Sad.

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.830
Mostly embarrassed, yup.

01:25:44.862 --> 01:25:47.465
Yeah.

01:25:47.499 --> 01:25:49.736
That was, um...

01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:54.207
Um...

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.707
I'm sorry.

01:25:55.741 --> 01:25:58.778
Coming over like that
last night, it was shitty.

01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:03.782
And, um, do you think that
maybe we could try and have

01:26:03.816 --> 01:26:06.419
that conversation again?

01:26:06.451 --> 01:26:07.820
Um...

01:26:07.853 --> 01:26:09.589
Erin...

01:26:11.656 --> 01:26:15.660
You may have been drunk
and upset, but...

01:26:16.995 --> 01:26:19.731
...my words
aren't gonna change.

01:26:26.772 --> 01:26:31.477
I will never forget...

01:26:33.411 --> 01:26:36.915
...that you're the first person
that I ever loved...

01:26:40.052 --> 01:26:42.955
...and you're the first woman
I ever slept with.

01:26:45.723 --> 01:26:47.392
But...

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.896
I need to move forward.

01:26:53.799 --> 01:26:57.503
What we had, it was...

01:26:57.536 --> 01:27:01.841
...intense and terrifying...

01:27:03.909 --> 01:27:06.711
...and unhealthy.

01:27:06.745 --> 01:27:08.347
And...

01:27:09.881 --> 01:27:13.786
And perhaps maybe you think
you need to be with me

01:27:13.818 --> 01:27:14.687
because I was your first,

01:27:14.719 --> 01:27:16.354
but it doesn't need
to be that way,

01:27:16.388 --> 01:27:19.725
it doesn't need to be
all or nothing

01:27:19.758 --> 01:27:23.362
or painful or dramatic.

01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:29.768
I think, for me,

01:27:29.802 --> 01:27:33.673
I need stability...

01:27:36.474 --> 01:27:37.942
I need to explore,

01:27:37.976 --> 01:27:40.946
and I need to learn who I am.

01:27:40.978 --> 01:27:42.647
And...

01:27:45.451 --> 01:27:47.019
I just...

01:27:49.354 --> 01:27:50.955
I just don't...
I just don't think

01:27:50.988 --> 01:27:53.491
that I could do that with you.

01:27:55.794 --> 01:27:57.028
I'm sorry.

01:27:58.429 --> 01:28:00.799
I'm sorry.

01:28:00.832 --> 01:28:04.070
I know that you wanted this
to go a different way.

01:28:06.839 --> 01:28:10.743
No, I, uh, I get it, yeah.

01:28:12.878 --> 01:28:14.580
But, um...

01:28:16.147 --> 01:28:17.949
Maybe one day?

01:28:19.617 --> 01:28:22.487
Maybe one day.

01:28:25.557 --> 01:28:27.660
But not now.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.795
Right.

01:28:35.701 --> 01:28:37.770
We're going to be okay.

01:28:37.803 --> 01:28:39.438
Okay?

01:28:42.607 --> 01:28:46.578
You are gonna be okay.

01:29:13.638 --> 01:29:15.740
Hey, Jule.

01:29:15.773 --> 01:29:17.642
Do you think
we can meet up later?

01:29:17.675 --> 01:29:19.745
There's something
I want to tell you.
