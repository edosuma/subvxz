[thunder crashing]

00:20.520 --> 00:22.814
[in Thai] When it rains,
do the small shrimp come out a lot?

00:23.314 --> 00:24.149
[man speaking Thai]

00:32.407 --> 00:35.660
[Bo Songvisava in English]
Thailand is a hospitality country.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.207
Whatever you ask, it's "Yes.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.380
I can do that for you."

00:49.466 --> 00:54.345
Thais have been serving
what the customer wants.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.307
They dumb down the flavors.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.604
But at my restaurant,
we're not gonna do that.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.024
We want to show them the real thing.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.864
We keep the flavors as traditional Thai.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.330
We're not gonna make it less spicy
because you can't eat spicy.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.919
People walk out from my restaurant.

01:26.836 --> 01:32.217
But... we are happier
if they decide not to eat.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.515
Because if the mind is not going to open
from the beginning,

01:38.598 --> 01:40.225
like, it's not going to work.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.436
[opening theme playing]

03:03.266 --> 03:05.185
[sizzling]

03:11.900 --> 03:15.820
[David Thompson] Most people think
that Thai food is a curry or a pad thai.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.240
But it's so much more.

03:22.035 --> 03:26.497
Great Thai food is
one of the hallmarks of humanity.

03:30.501 --> 03:34.756
Many people don't realize
how complicated and sophisticated it is.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.676
There's a diversity of ingredients

03:39.344 --> 03:41.054
and a provenance of recipes.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.348
It's artisanal.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.683
It is irrational.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.604
And it has a great heritage.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.529
Thais are beginning to articulate
their own understanding of Thai food.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.492
And it started with Bo.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.455
[Amanda Gale] You have
Thai food all over the world,

04:08.498 --> 04:12.627
but Thai food at Bo.Lan is real Thai food.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.798
Bo's working with her partner, Dylan,

04:17.382 --> 04:19.884
together, producing amazing food.

04:21.719 --> 04:26.432
Bo.Lan is the first Thai restaurant
to do things as it should be done,

04:27.850 --> 04:31.521
instead of recreating it
for the tourist palate.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.485
Every single curry paste is pounded out.

04:37.568 --> 04:40.071
Chili paste is made from scratch.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.703
The food is appreciated
more so by the older generations

04:46.786 --> 04:50.373
because it's very similar to the way
that their grandmother used to prepare it.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.170
[Thompson] Old-fashioned Thai food
has disappeared,

04:56.254 --> 05:00.258
apart from in the heads and restaurants
of a few mad fools.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.638
Traditionally, in Thailand,
when somebody died,

05:05.722 --> 05:09.434
the family wrote a eulogy
including recipes.

05:09.934 --> 05:15.273
Bo and Dylan based a lot of their recipes
on these older ideas.

05:18.067 --> 05:23.865
Also, Bo has that desire
to be as ethical as possible,

05:25.533 --> 05:29.287
which means their restaurant is
as sustainable as possible.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.417
For Bo,
it ain't about awards and accolades.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.211
It's about doing something you believe in.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.770
[birds and insects chirping]

05:53.853 --> 05:55.730
[indistinct chatter]

06:05.448 --> 06:06.783
[Songvisava] In Bangkok,

06:06.866 --> 06:12.413
when you ask people
simple questions about Thai food,

06:12.914 --> 06:16.000
people hardly can tell you
the correct answer.

06:21.172 --> 06:25.551
People in Thailand don't know how
to cook things from scratch anymore.

06:26.803 --> 06:29.597
They use all industrial,
processed products.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.682
Canned coconut.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.602
Packaged curry paste.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.063
Processed white sugar.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.862
The roots that we have are disappearing.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.909
If this continues...

06:52.995 --> 06:55.164
we would become industrialized.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.420
All the curry pastes made
from one company.

07:04.173 --> 07:09.429
Traditional Thai cuisine...
is gonna disappear.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.393
And it's like, "Shit."

07:15.893 --> 07:20.440
What, as a cuisine, are we gonna be?

07:25.653 --> 07:31.409
I feel this responsibility in keeping
Thai cuisine the way that it should be.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.708
I have to fight for Thai food.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.849
[utensils clattering]

07:56.142 --> 07:57.810
[Songvisava] New order.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.105
[in Thai] Fish, yes.
Quail, yes. Duck, yes.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.358
Barbecued pork neck, no.
Can we do duck instead?

08:04.442 --> 08:06.486
Forty-eight, two minutes.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.154
[staff] Yes, Chef!

08:10.531 --> 08:14.118
Bo has tenacity.
She's absolutely fearless.

08:18.706 --> 08:23.503
She will pick a fight despite being wrong.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.757
And she'll cut off her nose
to spite her face.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.343
Me and Dylan end up fighting all the time.
[chuckles]

08:30.426 --> 08:34.889
We fight on how we gonna cook this,
what we gonna put in first,

08:34.972 --> 08:37.850
how the flavor profile should be.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.645
I don't get his point.
He doesn't get my point.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.649
It's probably the same point
we see from different angles.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.654
We throw things at each other.
I splash his preps.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.990
He just picks me up
and puts me outside the kitchen.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.535
That is physical violence. You know that.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.662
[Jones] She wiped some curry paste on me.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.330
[in Thai] Yes, Chef.

09:00.164 --> 09:03.876
[in English] It was because I poured
a whole bowl of coconut cream on her head.

09:05.294 --> 09:09.298
But she poured
dirty, dirty dish liquid over me.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.802
And then we didn't speak
for a month and a half.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.262
Okay.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.805
[Jones] For the next two weeks,

09:15.888 --> 09:17.598
it was like, "Yes, Chef," "No, Chef,"
to each other,

09:17.682 --> 09:22.186
and just being uber polite
in a work environment,

09:22.270 --> 09:24.438
so that the other staff
weren't getting too upset.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.899
[in Thai] Add potatoes.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.735
No, you are a Westerner.
That's why you love potatoes.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.779
[Jones] Ha!

09:34.198 --> 09:35.324
[Songvisava] Taste good?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.704
-I am a Westerner. I love it.
-Westerner.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.082
[in English] I don't know
how staff cope with us.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.545
But I think the fighting
makes the relationship stronger.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.673
And it's not superficial love.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.803
And it gives that passion to our food.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.307
And that makes it better.

10:06.522 --> 10:07.648
[Jones speaking Thai]

10:07.732 --> 10:09.650
[Ethan in English] Wait.
Can you hold it, please?

10:09.734 --> 10:10.735
[Songvisava speaking Thai]

10:11.235 --> 10:13.112
Ethan. Ethan.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.117
-[in English] Fast.
-Can you put salt in for Mommy?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.327
Hey.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.828
[speaking indistinctly]

10:21.996 --> 10:22.872
[Songvisava] What's that?

10:22.955 --> 10:27.168
I was born in Bangkok. Grew up in Bangkok.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.966
I grew up in quite a big family.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.552
One of five.

10:39.096 --> 10:42.683
We grew up with food
on the table all the time.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.311
All different types of food:

10:45.394 --> 10:47.980
a lot of Chinese food,
a lot of Western food.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.567
But I loved Thai food the most.

10:53.402 --> 10:56.364
I spent a lot of time cooking with my dad.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.702
I had so much good time
with him in the kitchen.

11:01.786 --> 11:02.787
[Songvisava laughs]

11:04.080 --> 11:06.999
He let me do whatever I wanted to.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.793
It was fun.

11:11.212 --> 11:14.298
And that's how I started to love cooking.

11:16.759 --> 11:20.137
After high school,
I wanted to apply to cooking school.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.558
When I told my mom
that I really want to cook...

11:25.768 --> 11:27.812
Mom's just like, "No, no."

11:28.312 --> 11:30.106
My parents, they don't allow that.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.691
You have to have a degree.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.903
Negotiating with my mom,

11:35.986 --> 11:40.074
I chose a bachelor of business
in restaurant and catering management,

11:41.325 --> 11:45.830
because that is the closest
to cooking with a degree.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.769
[Jones] At Bo.Lan, our tasting menu

12:08.853 --> 12:11.647
lets the customer understand
how Thais used to eat.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.234
And for me, that really showcases

12:15.317 --> 12:19.071
the intensity and the integrity
that we know Thai food has.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.240
[Jones in Thai] Hello! Have you eaten yet?

12:21.323 --> 12:23.367
[staff] Hello! Have you eaten yet?

12:23.451 --> 12:25.870
[in English] Welcome, guys.
Please come in. How are you today?

12:25.953 --> 12:28.330
[in Thai] Hello! Welcome!

12:28.831 --> 12:31.000
Welcome to the kitchen.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.087
[in English] In the kitchen,
we offer our first bite.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.175
[speaking Thai]

12:39.258 --> 12:41.719
[in English]
It literally means "Turn over. Add salt."

12:41.802 --> 12:43.012
It's got only three ingredients.

12:43.095 --> 12:47.016
You've got salt, palm sugar
and toasted teenage coconut.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.273
[Jones] For us, it really emphasizes
and encompasses what

12:54.356 --> 12:57.318
Thai cuisine is,
and what important produce is.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.112
In Bangkok, a lot of the time,

13:00.196 --> 13:02.323
it's all about importing
the best ingredient from here or there.

13:02.406 --> 13:07.036
Whereas, at Bo.Lan, we're only using
product that comes from within Thailand.

13:07.119 --> 13:12.458
Our organic rice from Yasothon Province,
from the northeastern side of Thailand.

13:12.541 --> 13:16.545
[in Thai] It's like the "chili and salt"
my family ate when I was a child.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.841
Exactly what I used to eat.

13:20.925 --> 13:25.012
-I'm so glad. Phew.
-What a relief.

13:26.013 --> 13:29.433
[in English] And the ingredients are
the most important part of any Thai meal.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.478
But it doesn't matter
how good our ingredients are.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.105
They have to be cooked
with the traditional method.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.692
[Songvisava] To make the curry paste,
you can't blend it.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.320
You can't puree it. You can't juice it.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.863
It's not gonna work.

13:44.031 --> 13:48.536
The proper way in making
the curry paste is pounding it.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.912
[pounding paste]

13:49.995 --> 13:52.414
[Jones] When you pound it together,
the flavor's different.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.458
It's more intertwined.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.586
And it tastes the way
Thai cuisine used to taste.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.340
It's not the hard way. It's the right way.

14:03.467 --> 14:07.555
With a Western tasting menu,
you get one dish, one dish, one dish.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.308
We don't do that here at Bo.Lan.

14:13.310 --> 14:16.564
For the main course,
we give them seven dishes at once.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.025
From the framework of Thai cuisine,

14:20.109 --> 14:24.363
you need to have at least a curry, a soup,
a salad, a stir-fry and a relish.

14:26.532 --> 14:30.119
Through that interaction, people start to
understand the complexity of Thai cuisine,

14:30.202 --> 14:34.665
and that they can actually eat Thai food
as it ought to be eaten.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.796
[machine whirring, grinding]

15:13.829 --> 15:15.414
[in Thai] Is Brother Pe's delicious?

15:18.500 --> 15:20.836
It's because the durian is sweet,
but the taro is not.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.172
But this is too sweet.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.260
Really sweet.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.104
The color shouldn't be this clear.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.816
If it's this clear, then it's too sweet,
like dessert sticky rice.

15:48.030 --> 15:52.993
[in English] After I finish my bachelor,
I try to find any job at all.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.664
And I tell them
I do whatever in the kitchen.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.333
No one wants me. [chuckles]

16:00.584 --> 16:05.297
[Gale] Bo is an intelligent woman
and couldn't find a job in the kitchen.

16:06.548 --> 16:09.176
When I met her, she was eager to learn,

16:10.844 --> 16:12.554
but she wasn't cooking Thai food.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.890
She was cooking
in my Mediterranean restaurant.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.646
Bangkok back then, it was hard
to find good Thai food in a restaurant.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.650
[Songvisava] One day,
a foreign chef comes into the kitchen.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.444
They want to know about Thai food,
because they're in Thailand.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.196
And I don't have that knowledge at all.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.409
It's like, "Shit, why don't I know?"

16:37.496 --> 16:40.916
So, I asked my sous chefs, who are Thai.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.378
And they don't know anything
about Thai food,

16:45.254 --> 16:48.298
because they've been
working with Western food, as well.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.052
So, I ask around.

16:52.720 --> 16:59.685
I just found that Thai people don't know
about cooking Thai food anymore.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.854
It's sad. It's shocking.

17:03.731 --> 17:08.027
I decide that I really,
really have to dig into this.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.488
I have to learn Thai food.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.250
[horn honks]

17:24.877 --> 17:25.878
[sizzling]

17:29.631 --> 17:34.094
[Thompson] In Thailand, Thai food is not
a food that works well in restaurants.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.682
It's food that's eaten at home.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.811
Many Thais don't eat Thai food out.

17:42.895 --> 17:47.232
Or, if they do, they'll eat it out
on the street, and it is very cheap.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.072
If they're affluent enough
to eat in restaurants,

17:53.155 --> 17:56.784
they'll have a maid or two
that'll cook Thai food for them at home.

18:01.371 --> 18:05.501
So, restaurant food in Thailand
is expensive foreign food.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.421
One of the biggest pressures on Thai food

18:09.505 --> 18:11.673
is people's expectation
that it should be cheap.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.430
Only way you can cut the costs of the food

18:18.514 --> 18:20.682
is by reducing the quality
of the ingredients.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.853
So, many Thais are using
shoddy ingredients,

18:26.271 --> 18:28.232
reducing the quality of the food.

18:30.025 --> 18:33.529
The taste of Thai food is disappearing,

18:33.612 --> 18:37.157
'cause quality ingredients
are disappearing.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.576
And that's a great shame.

18:58.595 --> 18:59.763
[in Thai] Garlic.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.564
Shallots. We still have a lot. [chuckles]

19:11.483 --> 19:13.277
Okay, that's enough for now.

19:14.528 --> 19:19.366
Traditionally in Thai cuisine,
grilled shallots aren't used.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.660
Back home, my family
doesn't use shallots for this dish.

19:21.743 --> 19:23.162
No shallots at all, right?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.913
-Where are you from?
-From Rayong.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.874
Yes. They only add garlic.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.379
[Gale in English] When she was cooking
in my Mediterranean restaurant,

19:32.462 --> 19:36.341
Bo was quite keen to learn more
about her own cuisine.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.594
And that wasn't gonna happen in Bangkok.

19:39.469 --> 19:40.929
And I was like,
"Why don't you just get out

19:41.013 --> 19:43.765
and go and work
for David Thompson in London?"

19:45.976 --> 19:49.646
David was taking
Thai food to the next level.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.775
No Thai chefs were really doing that.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.196
I mean, it was a shame that it was
an Australian guy living in London.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.869
[Jones] David gave the rest of the world
access to Thai cuisine.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.080
It was real Thai food outside of Thailand

20:07.164 --> 20:09.124
that I don't think anybody
had really seen before.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.834
[scraping]

20:13.462 --> 20:18.675
David needed Thai people in the kitchen
to add, like, a little bit of Thai accent.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.930
Amanda introduced David to me.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.642
So, I landed in David's kitchen, Nahm,
in London.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.562
First week in London, I'm loving it.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.022
I love the architecture.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.691
I love the road. I love the bus.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.236
I just love London.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.614
Yeah, and then the work start. [chuckles]

20:40.989 --> 20:43.033
And then you never see London again.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.704
[Jones] After working
with David at Nahm for two years,

20:48.580 --> 20:51.959
Bo was the first Thai person
in the kitchen that we'd ever worked with.

20:55.629 --> 21:01.385
In the kitchen, I'm, like, the slowest
of the slowest that they ever met.

21:04.388 --> 21:08.558
They throw me a box of prawns,
and then I have to shell it.

21:09.893 --> 21:14.189
People do it in 15 minutes,
and it would take me three hours to do it.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.822
People are just like, "What?
You still doing that?"

21:23.240 --> 21:24.741
[Jones] Kitchens are hard places to work.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.119
You're lifting 20-liter stock pots.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.621
It's physically demanding all day.

21:29.705 --> 21:34.459
It's harder for, especially a young woman
who's still learning, to try and keep up,

21:34.543 --> 21:35.961
and she wouldn't ask for help.

21:36.044 --> 21:39.006
She wouldn't go,
"Can you help me pick up this pot?"

21:39.089 --> 21:41.174
No, she would just try and lift the pot.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.218
She would do everything herself.

21:50.350 --> 21:52.436
[Songvisava] I'd get cut,
like, all the time.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.773
I used all the bandages in the kitchen.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.111
And I end up in the hospital
a lot of times.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.616
When you're that young,
when you're that ambitious,

22:06.700 --> 22:08.452
you think you can do everything.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.995
You make it happen.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.832
[Jones] Eventually,
her skill level got to a point

22:13.915 --> 22:16.376
where she could compete in the kitchen.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.173
From then, she started
to really surpass other people.

22:23.175 --> 22:27.262
[Songvisava] When you catch up
with other people's pace,

22:27.346 --> 22:29.723
I'm now part of the team.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.232
[birds chirping]

22:48.658 --> 22:49.743
[indistinct chatter]

22:52.412 --> 22:53.413
[Jones in Thai]
Is this the water lily flower?

22:53.497 --> 22:55.624
[Songvisava] No,
it's the water hyacinth flower, isn't it?

22:55.707 --> 22:57.167
[woman] No, that is
Monochoria hastata Solms.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.835
[Songvisava] Monochoria hastata Solms?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.003
Can you eat it?

23:00.087 --> 23:03.173
[woman] No, you can't.
It's a type of weed.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.716
[Jones] Bo eats everything.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.634
[Songvisava] Hmm?

23:05.717 --> 23:07.344
[woman and Jones laugh]

23:08.595 --> 23:10.055
No, I don't.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.809
[in English] As a cook...

23:15.685 --> 23:19.231
I'm not a superhero. [chuckles]

23:20.482 --> 23:22.067
I need good ingredients.

23:22.150 --> 23:27.280
If I cannot have a good ingredient
to start with, I can't make good food,

23:27.364 --> 23:31.952
especially with Thai food, when every
single component has to combine together.

23:32.035 --> 23:34.204
[conversing in Thai]

23:37.499 --> 23:39.668
[Jones in English] What's sometimes
misunderstood about Thai cuisine is

23:40.168 --> 23:43.755
there's a lot of sugar in everything,
not just desserts,

23:43.839 --> 23:46.174
because there's a balance
of flavors happening.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.220
So, in a lot of savory items,

23:50.303 --> 23:53.390
salad dressings, curries, soups,
you'll have sugar.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.688
[Songvisava] The sugar
is so cheap in Thailand,

23:59.771 --> 24:01.606
because it's industrialized

24:02.941 --> 24:07.279
and because the government
subsidized the white sugar.

24:12.075 --> 24:16.746
But palm sugar is traditionally used
in Thai cuisine.

24:19.666 --> 24:22.711
[Jones] Palm sugar offers this complexity
that other sugars can't.

24:24.004 --> 24:28.175
Cooks with less integrity will start using
white sugar because it's cheaper.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.888
Aunt Jiang and Aunt Toom,
our palm sugar producer,

24:32.971 --> 24:35.891
use a traditional method
of making palm sugar.

24:43.398 --> 24:47.903
A more industrialized farm will have
chemicals in the receptacle they use,

24:48.403 --> 24:51.531
and they will go up the trees
twice or three times a week.

24:54.117 --> 24:56.536
Aunt Jiang and Aunt Toom
climb twice a day,

24:56.620 --> 24:58.413
since they don't use preservatives.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.543
And it's the best tasting sugar
you'll ever try.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.410
By sourcing the ingredients like this,

25:39.079 --> 25:43.166
Bo is putting the power back
in the hands of the producers

25:43.250 --> 25:46.211
and the people
who are cultivating our foods.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.691
[in Thai] This is the natural way.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.652
-[Jones] Mmm. Very much.
-[both chuckle]

26:10.735 --> 26:11.611
[Songvisava] True.

26:12.946 --> 26:16.032
[in English] We are dealing
with the smaller scale farmers,

26:16.116 --> 26:17.993
so they can grow organically.

26:25.166 --> 26:31.256
If you still support the industrialization
of food industry in general,

26:32.007 --> 26:33.883
we are gonna go nowhere.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.810
[woman speaking Thai]

26:53.445 --> 26:55.780
[all conversing in Thai]

27:04.039 --> 27:05.248
[Songvisava] So yummy, Auntie!

27:20.680 --> 27:24.392
[Jones speaking Thai and chuckling]

27:24.476 --> 27:25.769
[sizzling]

27:30.190 --> 27:34.110
[Songvisava] Wings, legs, intestines.
Stewed.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.404
[waitress] Wings, leg, intestines.
Extra blood?

27:36.488 --> 27:37.489
Yes.

27:38.615 --> 27:41.534
Rice noodles with chewy gizzard only.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.703
-Only the gizzard?
-Only the gizzard.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.331
Thank you, sister.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.879
[Songvisava in English] The second year
in Nahm, in London,

27:53.338 --> 27:55.090
we start seeing each other.

27:58.968 --> 28:01.805
Dylan asked whether, like,
"You want to check out the Tate Modern?"

28:01.888 --> 28:04.724
I was like, "Oh, yeah, not bad.
So, yeah, why not?"

28:16.778 --> 28:19.906
I didn't realize there was
something happening between us.

28:19.989 --> 28:23.493
Like most guys, I'm pretty obtuse
when it comes to women.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.704
[Songvisava] This is the better soup. Try.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.872
[Jones] We started hanging out more
outside of work.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.624
This one is saltier.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.712
[Songvisava] From then on, it's like...

28:34.295 --> 28:38.341
coffee before work,
and things like that happened.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.599
[Jones] It was a friendship, and then
it developed into something even more.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.435
It wasn't, like, this moment of...

28:48.935 --> 28:53.773
like, the sky opened up, and I heard
crickets and birds chirping and whatnot.

28:53.857 --> 28:57.110
It was a gradual thing,
and next thing you know, we're together.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.678
[man in Thai] Another one.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.600
Another one coming up.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.979
-[man 1] It's a barracuda.
-[man 2] Barracuda?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.024
[Songvisava exclaiming]

29:36.107 --> 29:37.108
[Jones] It's big.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.943
[Songvisava]
Careful with the teeth, Dylan.

29:39.027 --> 29:39.986
[Jones] Yeah, yeah.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.989
[both laughing]

29:50.246 --> 29:51.247
[Songvisava chuckles]

29:52.373 --> 29:56.211
-Chop the mango like a guava.
-[speaking Thai]

29:57.086 --> 30:00.423
Then continue from this one. Like this.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.842
It has natural characteristics.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.345
It's already good.

30:09.766 --> 30:14.229
[Thompson] Great Thai food relies upon
instinct inherent in the cook.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.439
And it's not something that's trained.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.733
It's just a natural style
that they have themselves.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.445
Bo, indeed, has that.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.325
[Songvisava] You have to add
a little bit more tamarind water.

30:28.535 --> 30:31.371
[in Thai] The flavor isn't working at all.
Not at all.

30:31.871 --> 30:35.124
[Thompson] Bo's taste
is absolutely outstanding.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.587
[Songvisava] In London,
other people in the kitchen trust me

30:39.671 --> 30:44.759
to taste their food
before the chef comes in and taste it.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.178
I can tell people,

30:47.262 --> 30:49.305
"This is yummy already.
You can serve that.

30:49.389 --> 30:50.515
This is not yummy."

30:50.598 --> 30:53.309
-[in Thai] This, add fish sauce.
-[cook] Okay, Chef.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.193
[Songvisava in English] After two years,

31:02.277 --> 31:06.739
David gave me the foundation
of Thai food that I need.

31:08.616 --> 31:13.371
But I realized there is something
lacking in me.

31:15.623 --> 31:19.627
I don't know what,
but I know I have to find out about it.

31:21.296 --> 31:22.922
I have to quit.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.218
And I have to go back to Thailand.

31:28.636 --> 31:31.014
[tractor engine whirring]

31:39.647 --> 31:40.940
[woman speaking Thai]

31:52.285 --> 31:54.621
[Songvisava in English]
Me and Dylan move to Bangkok.

31:55.663 --> 31:58.291
More like me dragging him here. [chuckles]

31:58.958 --> 32:01.002
[Jones] I love how they
use my head as a headrest.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.463
-[Songvisava] It's hard when you walk.
-Or a handrest.

32:03.546 --> 32:07.216
[Songvisava] We want to showcase
Thai food in Thailand.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.801
[crackling]

32:10.803 --> 32:15.266
I want to show the foreigners
traditional Thai cuisine,

32:16.017 --> 32:21.648
and to show Thai people
that you can be proud of what you got.

32:24.484 --> 32:28.446
Reality check is when no one thinks
it's gonna work.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.784
Everybody's like,
"If you want to open a Thai restaurant,

32:32.867 --> 32:36.746
you open in...
in Sydney, in Melbourne, in LA...

32:37.956 --> 32:39.666
not in Thailand.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.420
Why would you like to sell
ice to an Eskimo?"

32:47.340 --> 32:50.718
But at the back of my heart,
I know that it would have to be Thai.

32:55.890 --> 32:58.309
I have the conversation with my dad.

33:00.478 --> 33:04.440
I asked him,
"But what happens if I fuck up?"

33:09.570 --> 33:13.449
And he said,
"You decide that you want to do business,

33:13.533 --> 33:16.369
it's either fuck up or make profit.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.871
If you fuck up, you fuck up."

33:19.706 --> 33:20.707
[thunder crashing]

33:25.044 --> 33:26.671
[hostess in Thai] Next is reservations.

33:27.171 --> 33:31.092
We have 35 reservations for today.

33:31.676 --> 33:37.223
We have a table of three at 6:00 p.m.
Two adults, one seven-year-old.

33:37.306 --> 33:40.560
[Songvisava]
I still see guests eating just soup.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.396
You have to be more clear with them.

33:43.479 --> 33:46.441
Tell them... [in English]
"If you like, you can start with soup,

33:46.941 --> 33:49.527
but then move on
to other things, as well."

33:49.986 --> 33:55.575
[in Thai] Then encourage them
to use their hands to eat the quail.

33:56.075 --> 33:58.953
Don't forget to tell them
that the quail has bones.

33:59.037 --> 34:02.790
There will be guests that try to use
a spoon and fork to remove the bones.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.625
Some will gnaw on it. Others won't.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.462
That's their problem. Our job is to say,

34:07.545 --> 34:09.047
[in English] "This one have bone."

34:09.922 --> 34:11.924
[in Thai] Are there any more questions?

34:12.967 --> 34:15.011
[in English] Okay. That's it, then.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.929
-[Jones in Thai] Thank you.
-Thank you.

34:22.769 --> 34:24.687
[Songvisava in English]
When we first opened the restaurant,

34:24.771 --> 34:26.522
a customer came in and is like,

34:26.606 --> 34:28.733
"Yeah, there's nothing special
about this."

34:30.902 --> 34:32.445
[sighs] The first six months...

34:33.404 --> 34:34.530
it's sleepless...

34:35.531 --> 34:38.618
because the restaurant is mostly empty.

34:40.620 --> 34:44.624
You don't know, not only whether
you're going to have customers in,

34:44.707 --> 34:47.627
but whether your staff is gonna
show up or not tomorrow.

34:49.921 --> 34:53.341
When we first start, I tell Dylan,

34:53.424 --> 34:57.470
"Do not yell at the staff
the way you yell at the staff in London,

34:57.553 --> 35:00.306
because we are Thai,
and we are not gonna take that,

35:00.389 --> 35:02.100
and they're just gonna walk off."

35:03.601 --> 35:08.064
[in Thai] Waan, you can put
a bit more oil in this, the prawns.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.148
[Waan] Got it.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.400
[Songvisava in English] I end up
being the one who yells at everybody.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.277
[in Thai] This isn't spicy enough, dear.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.740
This, add a little bit of stock.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.702
-Add stock and see how it tastes.
-Yes, Chef.

35:22.286 --> 35:25.873
[Songvisava in English] To recruit people
professionally to work with us,

35:25.957 --> 35:29.252
it's, like, almost zero chance.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.671
Because if they're good,
they want to work with a hotel.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.135
There's one incident.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.387
The cook, he overcooked the squid.

35:39.470 --> 35:43.141
I'm just like, "Can I show you again
how I would like it?"

35:43.224 --> 35:45.518
-[in Thai] Like we did yesterday.
-Yes.

35:45.601 --> 35:47.061
Not enough water, dear.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.982
[in English] He said,
"Your food is too detail-oriented."

35:55.278 --> 35:57.071
"I have been nice three times already.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.992
I have explained to you
what I want. [chuckles]

36:01.075 --> 36:03.369
I'm not gonna be nice to you anymore."

36:05.496 --> 36:07.248
He says, "I quit."

36:09.876 --> 36:11.002
This is Thailand.

36:14.255 --> 36:19.177
But I have to groom
whoever agrees to work with me,

36:19.260 --> 36:20.970
to share the knowledge...

36:24.640 --> 36:26.934
because I have to fight for Thai food.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.199
[indistinct chatter]

36:51.792 --> 36:53.461
[indistinct chatter]

37:13.105 --> 37:15.233
[in Thai] Wow, you have Cambodian garlic?

37:16.025 --> 37:18.903
Cambodian garlic.
One hundred baht per kilo.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.988
Peeled Chinese garlic, 70 baht per kilo.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.991
Thai garlic, 130 baht per kilo.

37:25.117 --> 37:28.371
-[in English] How does that work?
-I don't know. Because obviously--

37:28.454 --> 37:31.958
[in Thai] Is Cambodian garlic good?
Or is Thai better?

37:32.041 --> 37:34.543
-[stall operator] Thai is more aromatic.
-Thai is more aromatic, right?

37:34.627 --> 37:36.712
I'm glad Thai garlic is more aromatic.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.299
[Songvisava speaking Thai]

37:40.383 --> 37:41.926
[Jones in English]
No, we're gonna have some growing...

37:42.009 --> 37:43.594
[Songvisava] When we first opened,

37:43.678 --> 37:45.680
we said we're gonna use
everything 100% local,

37:45.763 --> 37:49.517
make everything from scratch,
and we're gonna be 100% organic.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.851
The reality hit.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.188
We can't get organic produce.

37:56.857 --> 38:00.027
[Jones] For six months,
we went from market to market,

38:00.820 --> 38:04.198
getting up at 6:00 in the morning
to go to Or Tor Kor Market,

38:06.242 --> 38:08.953
and then go to the next market.

38:09.036 --> 38:11.998
And then we'd go to Khlong Toey Market
in the middle of the night.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.255
Asking, "Where are you getting this?
Where are you getting that?"

38:19.338 --> 38:22.717
And half the people selling our produce
was like, "We don't know."

38:23.301 --> 38:25.011
[in Thai] How do you cook this?

38:26.053 --> 38:27.847
-Just poach it.
-Poach?

38:27.930 --> 38:29.849
-It's good to dip in chili paste.
-In chili paste?

38:29.932 --> 38:32.518
-Is it good boiled?
-It's the same as poached.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.562
[Jones] And a lot of the ingredients
that we're finding,

38:34.645 --> 38:36.939
we say, "What do you do with that?"
And they say, "Boil it."

38:37.023 --> 38:40.901
And that was the standard answer
for any ingredient they didn't know about.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.112
We almost gave up.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.532
We thought, "This is ridiculous.

38:46.615 --> 38:49.577
There has to be organic produce
available in Thailand."

38:53.247 --> 38:56.709
So, we decided to visit the farms
to see what's going on.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.843
[Songvisava] We want to see
different farms

39:05.926 --> 39:08.054
to see how they produce their food.

39:08.637 --> 39:11.807
So, we drive everywhere in Thailand.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.894
[Jones in Thai] Is it
mostly vegetable farms here?

39:15.478 --> 39:17.188
[woman] You can eat this one raw.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.231
It's sweet and delicious.

39:21.567 --> 39:25.571
[Songvisava in English] You can tell
from the farms, when we first arrive,

39:26.238 --> 39:28.949
whether they use any chemical.

39:29.617 --> 39:34.914
And we learned that organic suppliers
are disappearing in the society.

39:37.083 --> 39:41.087
Then, we finally find someone
who wants to sell us organic produce,

39:41.170 --> 39:45.049
so we hang on to them,
and we develop a relationship.

39:45.966 --> 39:50.221
These farmers have so much good knowledge
about Thai food.

39:51.222 --> 39:55.893
[in Thai] There is some sap. We prefer
not to eat it raw. We cook it first.

39:55.976 --> 39:57.853
-Okay.
-It's tasty.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.647
It's also high in protein.

39:59.730 --> 40:04.485
This is excellent for vegetarians.

40:07.905 --> 40:11.409
[Songvisava in English] At the farm,
we learned that ingredients in Thailand

40:11.992 --> 40:14.328
are the secret in real Thai cuisine.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.416
Suddenly, everything became clear.

40:25.798 --> 40:31.762
So, we change the menu to emphasize
the flavor of all the Thai ingredients.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.437
And because we use organic produce,

40:40.563 --> 40:43.566
because we cook everything from scratch,

40:46.110 --> 40:48.737
because we use artisan products,

40:49.947 --> 40:51.490
the food tastes better.

40:52.658 --> 40:58.205
More and more people come to Bo.Lan
to experience the real thing.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.586
Over time,
we find the small-scale farmers,

41:04.295 --> 41:06.130
small-scale fishermen,

41:06.964 --> 41:08.674
artisan producers.

41:09.925 --> 41:13.095
And we were able to make Bo.Lan
100% organic.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.266
Talking to farmers,

41:17.349 --> 41:21.937
I learned that industrialized ingredients
are hurting the environment.

41:23.439 --> 41:27.151
If you do things
not sustainable to our farms,

41:27.234 --> 41:28.694
they will disappear.

41:30.279 --> 41:35.493
I realized to have traditional
Thai food in Thailand,

41:35.576 --> 41:39.330
you really have to start caring
about the environment.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.708
[Jones] If we don't make any changes now,

41:42.791 --> 41:45.711
there won't be food for us to eat,
like we know it, in the future.

41:46.879 --> 41:49.590
So, we have to look after the soil,
look after the ocean,

41:49.673 --> 41:51.383
the environment around us.

41:51.467 --> 41:55.638
So, we've decided to really focus
on those aspects within the restaurant,

41:56.305 --> 41:58.557
making the restaurant
as sustainable as possible.

42:00.768 --> 42:03.479
And we're trying to achieve zero carbon.

42:05.189 --> 42:07.900
When Bo was awarded
the best female chef in Asia,

42:08.400 --> 42:09.902
she used that as a platform.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.489
She's speaking about

42:13.572 --> 42:16.200
the environmental issues
we're facing today,

42:16.784 --> 42:21.622
educating people
on why it's bad to use single-use plastic,

42:21.705 --> 42:25.084
why organic farmers are really important.

42:26.794 --> 42:27.878
And Bo will stand up and fight

42:27.962 --> 42:30.756
for something she believes in
until her last breath.

42:34.843 --> 42:37.054
[Songvisava] I decide to use

42:38.013 --> 42:39.265
my power,

42:40.516 --> 42:41.809
as a chef,

42:43.185 --> 42:44.812
to change the world.

42:46.522 --> 42:49.692
We have to fight for our food,

42:50.693 --> 42:52.403
our Thailand,

42:54.822 --> 42:56.282
our whole world.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.952
[Gale] Bo was always destined
for amazing things.

43:43.162 --> 43:47.458
She has emerged
as the authentic Thai food expert.

43:48.709 --> 43:51.920
She is keeping Thai food alive.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.010
I don't see her slowing down at all.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.346
She won't stop.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.932
[Thompson] Bo's food galvanizes people.

44:07.269 --> 44:12.524
There's this wonderful mash
of culture, of custom, of chaos,

44:12.608 --> 44:18.197
of serenity, of taste, of spice,
of confusion, and of charm.

44:18.864 --> 44:19.948
Like Bangkok itself.

44:22.284 --> 44:25.537
Bo is the leader of Thais controlling
Thai culture.

44:27.373 --> 44:30.125
Dylan and Bo believe
in what they're doing,

44:30.209 --> 44:35.255
and they'll continue doing it
because they have that profound desire

44:35.339 --> 44:37.383
to do something they believe in.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.403
[kids chattering]

44:59.655 --> 45:03.075
This one is not hot anymore. Try.

45:03.617 --> 45:07.955
Before, I'd feel this responsibility
in keeping Thai cuisine

45:08.038 --> 45:10.165
the way that it should be.

45:14.753 --> 45:19.091
But... learning about the environment

45:19.466 --> 45:23.095
and what we do with it in the society...

45:24.555 --> 45:28.934
reorganized the priorities
of what is important in life.

45:31.019 --> 45:33.772
It's not only cooking.
It's not only eating.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.691
It's how you live your life.

45:37.568 --> 45:40.529
Not only affect you,
but the next generation.

45:42.322 --> 45:46.869
Now, I feel this responsibility
to preserve and pass on our planet.

45:48.829 --> 45:52.875
If you choose the sustainable approach,

45:52.958 --> 45:57.045
it will last to the next generation.

45:58.839 --> 46:01.091
It can be a way of life.
