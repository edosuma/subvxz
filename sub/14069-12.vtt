How'd it go?

38:23.330 --> 38:25.297
It went well.

38:27.101 --> 38:28.967
I'm glad.

38:31.138 --> 38:34.339
As a matter of fact,
I need your help with something.

38:34.375 --> 38:35.574
Anything.

38:35.609 --> 38:37.442
But there's something
you have to do first.

38:40.681 --> 38:42.214
- Mr. Ross.
- Miss Price.

38:42.249 --> 38:43.894
I wanted to talk to you.
Do you have a minute?

38:43.918 --> 38:45.384
Not really.

38:45.419 --> 38:48.287
They're coming tomorrow.
I've been packing, and--

38:48.322 --> 38:49.688
They're not coming.

38:54.862 --> 38:56.628
$3,600?

38:56.664 --> 38:58.775
Should be enough to cover your
rent for the last three months.

38:58.799 --> 39:00.632
- I don't understand.
- The clinic has a fund

39:00.668 --> 39:02.234
to help
with this kind of thing.

39:02.269 --> 39:03.936
We do it all the time.

39:03.971 --> 39:06.505
But this is from you.

39:06.540 --> 39:08.574
It's just quicker to do it
from my account--

39:08.609 --> 39:12.511
you know, red tape
and all that.

39:12.841 --> 39:14.652
- I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll take that

39:14.676 --> 39:16.710
to your landlord
first thing in the morning.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.145
And if they do anything
but give you a written receipt,

39:19.181 --> 39:21.715
you call me right away.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.783
I will. Thank you.

39:23.819 --> 39:25.819
[both chuckle]

39:31.378 --> 39:33.344
- You're back.
- I am.

39:33.380 --> 39:37.048
And I heard you took care
of my client.

39:37.084 --> 39:38.950
Thanks, Louis.

39:38.985 --> 39:42.053
You're welcome,
but we're partners,

39:42.089 --> 39:43.988
and they're all our clients.

39:44.024 --> 39:46.157
They are.

39:46.193 --> 39:48.560
Louis, I didn't mean it
when I said

39:48.595 --> 39:51.763
you weren't ready to be
managing partner.

39:51.798 --> 39:53.465
Yes, you did.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.967
Maybe I did,
but the truth is,

39:56.003 --> 39:59.037
I'm not ready either.

39:59.073 --> 40:03.241
What do you say we both act
as interim managing partners?

40:04.411 --> 40:06.044
I'd be honored.

40:08.716 --> 40:10.360
It seems to me,
the first order of business is,

40:10.384 --> 40:12.651
what are we gonna do about
the name of the firm?

40:14.421 --> 40:17.656
I don't know
about you, but...

40:17.691 --> 40:20.025
I think we should keep it
exactly the same.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.326
Me too.

40:21.362 --> 40:22.627
I mean, you never know

40:22.663 --> 40:25.464
when she's gonna want
to come back, right?

40:25.499 --> 40:29.368
No, Louis.
You never know.

40:38.344 --> 40:40.478
What are you two
still doing here?

40:40.513 --> 40:41.979
We've still got 12 hours.

40:42.014 --> 40:44.548
We're not going to stop trying
to keep Sofia in her apartment.

40:44.584 --> 40:45.950
Good for you.

40:45.985 --> 40:49.520
But you don't
have to do it tonight.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.492
Turns out she got
a little grace period.

40:54.527 --> 40:55.993
How did she get that?

40:56.028 --> 40:57.628
It's amazing
what you can do

40:57.663 --> 40:59.730
when you care
about your clients.

41:02.201 --> 41:04.268
Then I guess
first thing tomorrow,

41:04.303 --> 41:07.605
we should plan our next move.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.607
I guess we should.
