WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:01.950
Previously on damages...

00:02.000 --> 00:05.100
I believe daniel purcell's
wife may have been murdered

00:05.110 --> 00:08.189
to protect the secrets of
a major energy corporation.

00:08.250 --> 00:11.150
Ultima national resources is
destroying the environment,

00:11.180 --> 00:13.400
and that's the guy who calls the shots.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.450
Walter kendrick, ceo.

00:15.490 --> 00:20.370
We'll need you to testify that aracite is
toxic and that unr ignores your warnings.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.110
I'll do whatever you need me to.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.800
Unr doctored nothing.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.620
Their results are clean.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.110
Motion denied.

00:27.130 --> 00:28.840
You think ultima national got to him?

00:28.880 --> 00:33.350
Mr. Kendrick just wanted you to know
that the first wire transfer went through.

00:33.370 --> 00:36.410
I'm agent harrison, this is
agent werner. We're with the fbi.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.170
The bureau's putting together
a case we want patty to take.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.860
We'll use you to monitor
it from the inside.

00:41.870 --> 00:42.770
Patty.

00:42.790 --> 00:44.960
Don't take the infant mortality case.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.670
You were the one who brought
in that case, weren't you?

00:48.860 --> 00:51.970
Ellen, have you had
any dreams this week?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.240
I can't sleep.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.200
Her fianc? was murdered a month
ago. How is she supposed to sleep?

00:56.210 --> 00:58.990
This is detective rick messer. He
asked if he could take a look around.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.450
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.050
What about david connor?

01:02.070 --> 01:04.360
- Do I have to worry about him?
- No.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.680
Arthur frobisher had your
fianc? killed, didn't he?

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.060 --> 01:20.590
Thanks for inviting me, patty.

01:23.020 --> 01:26.140
- I've been worried about you.
- Worried?

01:27.040 --> 01:31.430
When daniel purcell flipped on the
stand, he humiliated you in open court.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.300
Daniel purcell is in the past.

01:36.310 --> 01:39.570
Come on, patty. Don't
tell me you're not angry.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.640
I ever tell you how i choose a case?

01:46.040 --> 01:48.010
No.

01:48.020 --> 01:51.670
I used to not understand it.

01:51.810 --> 01:55.180
You know, why some cases
grabbed me and others didn't?

01:55.190 --> 01:58.130
Then I realized...

01:58.170 --> 02:02.490
it starts with a seed of anger.

02:03.010 --> 02:08.900
I can feel it in my hands and my
chest, and that seed has to be nurtured,

02:08.949 --> 02:14.250
cultivated until it grows
into a full-blown rage.

02:14.260 --> 02:17.380
Then I know that I can't turn back.

02:17.440 --> 02:23.620
I have no choice but to take the
case because the rage doesn't abate.

02:23.670 --> 02:26.550
Until someone's punished.

02:27.740 --> 02:30.880
Do you feel that, too?

02:30.890 --> 02:36.020
I've begun to recently. Thank you.

02:41.250 --> 02:46.030
Purcell may have betrayed
me, but he's just a pawn.

02:46.780 --> 02:51.990
This is all about ultima
national resources.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.690
We're going after them,

02:56.700 --> 03:01.270
and if daniel purcell
is a casualty, so be it.

03:04.220 --> 03:08.000
I'll do what I can, mr. Purcell, but it's
really not a seller's market right now.

03:08.030 --> 03:10.460
I don't care about the
price. Just get rid of it.

03:10.470 --> 03:12.160
Okay.

03:12.190 --> 03:13.440
The sooner the better.

03:13.470 --> 03:17.590
I understand. I'm sorry about your wife.

03:19.850 --> 03:22.070
- You have to make a decision, daniel.
- I know.

03:22.105 --> 03:22.405
{\a6}5 WEEKS EARLIER

03:22.440 --> 03:26.320
If that company is making people
sick, you have to stop them.

03:28.060 --> 03:29.840
Because I'm not going
to blow the whistle.

03:29.850 --> 03:30.800
What?

03:30.820 --> 03:32.610
I made a deal.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.750
With unr?

03:34.760 --> 03:36.500
They're going to leave us alone now.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.820
You gave in to them.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.110
I had no choice.

03:39.130 --> 03:42.700
If you don't stop them, I will.

04:26.370 --> 04:29.360
<font color=#00FFFF>Damages
Season02 Episode05</font>

04:30.620 --> 04:33.960
My true motivation in
aligning these two companies

04:34.010 --> 04:38.190
is the golden opportunity to
merge corporate philosophies.

04:38.220 --> 04:43.060
This goes way beyond tax incentives,
way beyond the marketization of capital.

04:43.090 --> 04:44.690
The synergy that...

04:44.700 --> 04:48.020
That's why kendrick was so desperate
to cover up the aracite contamination.

04:48.050 --> 04:51.090
A massive class action suit
would have killed his merger.

04:51.150 --> 04:53.230
So what can we do?Without
daniel purcell as a witness,

04:53.240 --> 04:56.340
it's impossible to bring
a lawsuit against unr.

04:56.370 --> 05:00.210
And if this merger goes through, they'll
have twice the resources to fight us.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.890
Unless, of course, we
can stop the merger.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.200
That's what we're going to try to do.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.830
Get me a complete legal and
financial history of unr.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.470
Right, yep, I'm on it.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.580
Um, did you invite her?

05:14.610 --> 05:15.830
Invite me where?

05:15.850 --> 05:18.810
Uh, patty will tell you.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.230
Tom's been with the
firm ten years this week.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.530
Oh, great. I had no idea.

05:27.040 --> 05:32.190
I'm hosting a small get-together
at my place to celebrate.

05:32.580 --> 05:35.350
I'd love to have you come.

05:37.110 --> 05:42.710
I know you haven't been
back to my apartment since...

05:44.250 --> 05:49.560
so if you don't feel comfortable
joining us, I understand.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.280
Thank you.

05:52.310 --> 05:56.510
This isn't a work obligation.
It's just a friendly invitation.

05:57.610 --> 06:00.390
Whatever you decide.

06:05.370 --> 06:10.000
As representative of the energy commission,
I have serious concerns about this merger.

06:10.590 --> 06:13.020
You wouldn't be doing
your job if you didn'T.

06:13.060 --> 06:14.980
Specifically on the environmental front.

06:15.030 --> 06:18.670
Well, we fully intend on
easing your worries, mr. Schiff.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.860
That's why I've brought
mr. Purcell here today.

06:21.890 --> 06:25.480
Daniel is vice president
and head of research.

06:25.490 --> 06:28.330
They do independent scientific analysis.

06:28.370 --> 06:32.920
We were contracted to analyze
risk and environmental sensitivity

06:32.930 --> 06:36.770
at all unr operating sites nationwide.

06:36.820 --> 06:38.600
And what did your firm find?

06:38.630 --> 06:42.910
Our results are
published in this report,

06:42.930 --> 06:47.270
but the upshot is that unr complies
with every standard set forth

06:47.280 --> 06:50.450
in the international
environmental management system--

06:50.500 --> 06:53.850
iso 14001.

06:54.850 --> 06:57.500
I look forward to reading that through.

06:57.530 --> 07:02.770
In your opinion, mr. Purcell, if our
commission were to ratify the proposed merger,

07:02.810 --> 07:08.880
do you have any concerns with regards to
the safety of future unr joint operations?

07:08.900 --> 07:10.910
None.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.170
Environmental protection policies
are built into unr's operations

07:14.180 --> 07:17.760
at every existing site,
both onshore and off.

07:17.810 --> 07:22.710
They pose absolutely no
risk to the environment.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.630
Sure you don't want anything?

07:28.410 --> 07:29.970
Yeah, we're good.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.020
So, what's your feeling
on this dinner party?

07:33.050 --> 07:35.150
I never want to go back
to that apartment again.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.910
If it's not now, you'll
have to go some other time.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.450
Yeah. I get that.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.600
But it's your decision.

07:42.610 --> 07:45.230
If you're not ready, we understand.

07:45.660 --> 07:49.530
If you do go, we want you to record it.

08:05.130 --> 08:06.910
Mr. Schiff is ready.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.970
Thank you.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.330
- Doug.
- Come on in.

08:12.340 --> 08:14.210
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.900
These are serious allegations.

08:20.950 --> 08:22.990
It's an environmental nightmare.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.980
I wouldn't waste your time, doug.

08:24.990 --> 08:26.230
Who else knows?

08:26.280 --> 08:28.860
No one has this information but me.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.530
And what do you aim to do?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.970
Kill the merger.

08:32.980 --> 08:36.669
But the state supreme court will never
take a stand against walter kendrick.

08:36.730 --> 08:39.690
He has west virginia wrapped
around his little finger.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.059
Yeah, I see that.

08:41.090 --> 08:45.670
Your commission may be the
only thing that can stop him.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.560
Nothing can happen without
the approval of this office.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.520
Patty, what I'm reading is
speculative. It may not be enough.

08:53.530 --> 08:56.360
At least you could stall him.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.320
Buy me time to find more.

08:58.350 --> 09:01.260
My office needs to issue a
ruling by the end of next week.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.220
That's all the time I need.

09:10.270 --> 09:12.880
Tremendous view.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.740
So this federal regulator...

09:15.760 --> 09:18.300
- Douglas schiff.
- Yeah.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.670
He's stalling. It's pissing me off.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.630
I've explored that situation.

09:22.650 --> 09:25.080
And where are we?

09:25.090 --> 09:27.820
What do you mean, "no"?
There has to be a way in.

09:27.830 --> 09:31.180
Schiff has no extracurriculars.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.600
He's clean?

09:33.620 --> 09:36.090
Spotless.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.750
I could always get creative.

09:39.770 --> 09:41.650
No. Don'T.

09:41.660 --> 09:44.430
This is a deputy director
of a federal agency.

09:44.470 --> 09:47.230
There's too much attention as it is.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.520
Do you have more instructions?

09:51.560 --> 09:54.160
No, you can go.

09:57.670 --> 10:00.200
But keep in touch.

10:04.930 --> 10:08.670
We're here tonight to
honor walter kendrick.

10:10.810 --> 10:14.600
he was recently voted club president.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.480
it's a night of grand tradition.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.800
And I know it's just a
ritual, but I gotta tell you--

10:19.850 --> 10:23.210
walt, you wear a skirt better
than any president we've had

10:23.250 --> 10:26.330
- since your grandfather shep kendrick.
- All right.

10:27.370 --> 10:30.290
'Course, he turned out to be a fag.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.670
You'd like a little of
this wouldn't you, hank?

10:35.680 --> 10:40.490
As many of you know, walt, was born
in the great state of west virginia.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.800
His roots are there.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.000
Oh, yeah, he loves the place.

10:44.030 --> 10:49.600
He did, however, break with tradition
by not marrying one of his cousins.

10:50.290 --> 10:53.520
apparently, they all had too many teeth.

10:53.530 --> 10:58.980
Seriously though, I always wondered why birds
flew over the state of west virginia upside down.

10:58.990 --> 11:04.090
And then I met this guy-- and i realized
there is nothing there worth shitting on.

11:06.950 --> 11:09.990
looking out over the
crowd, i can see that, uh,

11:10.020 --> 11:13.320
walt's favorite attorney, claire
maddox, is not in attendance.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.990
Any of you folks know claire maddox?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.420
Yeah.

11:16.450 --> 11:18.990
That lady gets around.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.170
I'm not saying I don't want
to throw a hump into her,

11:21.200 --> 11:25.940
but i have a feeling it'd be like
tossing a hotdog down a hallway.

11:35.550 --> 11:37.830
- Great stuff in there.
- Yeah?

11:37.840 --> 11:43.710
Well, I was warned to tone it down, but I
figured, you know, it's tradition, right?

11:44.290 --> 11:47.590
It's nothing personal. You
gotta be able to swallow it.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.020
You're a terrific sport, mr. Kendrick.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.200
I agree. It wasn't funny.

12:07.610 --> 12:10.960
I was told you have a
little merger problem.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.260
I think patty hewes leaked information to
some asshole on the regulatory commission.

12:16.990 --> 12:20.120
How can I help?

12:38.440 --> 12:40.990
Ellen. Good to see you.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.740
- Come on in, make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

12:51.010 --> 12:53.060
You remember, deb. Right?

12:54.590 --> 12:57.060
- Nice to see you again.
- You, too.

12:57.070 --> 13:00.080
Oh, congratulations.
How far along are you?

13:00.090 --> 13:02.110
About four-and-a-half
months.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.340
That's great.

13:03.380 --> 13:06.730
And congratulations
to you-- ten years.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.620
It's amazing that you survived.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.140
It's only because of
this one right here.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.900
Oh, excuse me.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.260
Tom!

13:37.910 --> 13:40.210
Ellen.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.680
Patty asked me to organize the speeches.

13:43.710 --> 13:46.390
Nothing fancy. You'll say
a few words after dinner.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.110
I... I haven't, uh, prepared anything.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.860
Just kidding, ellen.

13:50.890 --> 13:53.670
You know the woman hates speeches.

14:04.230 --> 14:06.140
Everything all right?

14:06.920 --> 14:10.520
Yeah. Just fine.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.190
Cheers.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.660
Cheers.

14:25.450 --> 14:27.800
How'd I do?

14:32.140 --> 14:34.110
I didn't hit him once?

14:34.130 --> 14:36.160
If nothing else, I'm
sure you scared him.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.660
How is that even possible?

14:37.670 --> 14:39.560
It takes time.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.990
Besides, look at his
face, he's terrified.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.680
No way he didn't shit himself.

14:43.690 --> 14:45.500
Shut up. Send him back.

14:45.510 --> 14:49.410
I'm not leaving until I
cap this asshole. Come on.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.590
So why the interest in firearms?

14:56.970 --> 15:02.880
I never told you, but, uh, someone tried
to kill me the night my fianc? was murdered.

15:04.140 --> 15:06.930
- Frobisher's people?
- No.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.120
- Who, then?
- I don't know.

15:09.130 --> 15:13.230
But, uh, I won't ever
feel that vulnerable again.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.590
Yeah, of course.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.870
So, thanks for the lesson.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.140
Yeah. Same time next week, then?

15:21.150 --> 15:25.100
Yeah. I'm gonna put a hole
in that thing if it kills me.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.190
I'll see you, wes.

15:37.450 --> 15:40.770
Suddenly she wants to
learn how to use a gun.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.480
I don't know if you're safe.

15:56.150 --> 15:59.130
5 MONTHS LATER

16:01.180 --> 16:04.180
I told you, you can't be here today.

16:04.670 --> 16:07.440
Oh, I'm sorry. I just, um...

16:08.180 --> 16:10.480
What's wrong?

16:12.200 --> 16:14.700
I just had to see you.

16:14.710 --> 16:17.530
Are you okay?

16:18.230 --> 16:20.330
Yeah.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.390
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

16:30.910 --> 16:34.770
I think the rate of return against
the yen is grossly undervalued.

16:34.780 --> 16:37.410
Clearly, there's a window of
opportunity about to open there.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.740
Well, let's stay on top of
it. I don't want to miss out.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.490
You got it.

16:42.470 --> 16:44.720
I've only got a minute.

16:45.770 --> 16:48.500
Well, dave.

16:48.510 --> 16:50.230
How's life in the private sector?

16:50.280 --> 16:53.510
Excellent. I've been down in
bogota the past couple of months.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.200
I didn't know you were
heading that up. Good for you.

16:56.210 --> 17:00.030
Yeah, thanks. But, phil,
that's not why I'm here.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.600
You didn't hear this from me.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.760
I caught wind of
something you should know.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.760
Okay.

17:07.770 --> 17:10.410
It's about your wife.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.540
You're home late.

17:14.569 --> 17:20.640
Yeah, I was researching ultima
national's legal history.

17:22.980 --> 17:25.069
We need to talk.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.460
What? Is it michael?

17:28.470 --> 17:32.480
No, no. Somebody came to me.

17:32.490 --> 17:35.600
He's connected, and
he's heard rumblings.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.300
What rumblings?

17:37.330 --> 17:41.410
Apparently, there are forces in the business
world that would love to put you out of business.

17:43.370 --> 17:45.170
That's not news.

17:45.210 --> 17:49.500
No, but it's an understatement to say
that there are ceo's who don't like you,

17:49.540 --> 17:53.320
and they're using their influence
in washington against you.

17:53.910 --> 17:56.650
Are you saying I'm under investigation?

17:56.680 --> 17:58.240
I don't know.

17:58.300 --> 18:01.250
But I doubt he'd talk
to me if you weren'T.

18:05.660 --> 18:08.430
I don't know what you've
done. I don't need to know.

18:09.050 --> 18:13.170
But you have to be sure there's nothing
out there that they can hang you with.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.710
You have nothing to worry about.

18:21.740 --> 18:24.020
Scrutiny won't be an issue.

18:24.030 --> 18:25.550
How can you be sure?

18:25.590 --> 18:28.400
Because I don't leave loose ends.

18:28.430 --> 18:30.610
I've never left you vulnerable.

18:30.670 --> 18:32.800
From day one, you've been insulated.

18:32.850 --> 18:37.400
I'm talking about loose ends that could
go all the way back to the old firm.

18:38.050 --> 18:43.720
If I'm under investigation, god knows
what they'll try to use to hurt me.

18:43.750 --> 18:49.420
I've said it before-- the only thing
that can hurt you is ellen parsons.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.950
She brought in the infant
mortality case, don't forget.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.410
I haven'T.

18:55.450 --> 18:58.070
- You almost took that case.
- I know.

18:58.910 --> 19:01.030
Could have been a setup.

19:01.050 --> 19:07.390
Ask yourself, after everything that happened
to her, why did she come back to work?

19:08.590 --> 19:11.370
*******

19:14.550 --> 19:16.970
Something's been bothering me.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.590
Yeah?

19:19.630 --> 19:22.760
That infant mortality case.

19:23.110 --> 19:26.920
I've been thinking about the
plaintiff that wanted to pay off.

19:27.310 --> 19:29.640
What was her name?

19:29.670 --> 19:32.640
- Monique bryant.
- Bryant, right.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.020
How did you find her?

19:35.080 --> 19:38.940
Um, someone in grief
counseling referred her to me.

19:39.930 --> 19:42.090
Who?

19:42.120 --> 19:45.510
They're adamant about privacy.
I... I can't give any names.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.870
Right. I'm sorry. Of course. I...

19:50.460 --> 19:54.550
I'm just concerned that someone
was trying to set you up.

19:55.390 --> 19:56.930
Why would anyone want to do that?

19:56.980 --> 19:59.170
I don't know.

20:00.680 --> 20:03.520
I just...

20:03.570 --> 20:08.300
something about that
case never felt right.

20:15.420 --> 20:20.410
It was wonderful having you at dinner
the other night. I hope you had fun.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.490
I had a lovely time.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.360
Patty's getting nervous.

20:34.840 --> 20:39.490
Yeah, it's about the girl.
We need to take action.

20:55.810 --> 20:58.730
So nothing useful came
out at the dinner party.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.440
- but patty's acting strange.
- How so?

21:01.450 --> 21:02.980
She seems paranoid.

21:02.990 --> 21:06.230
Let's take a walk. Is that your wife?

21:06.760 --> 21:09.000
Sorry.

21:09.570 --> 21:12.930
********

21:23.550 --> 21:27.010
- You off to london?
- Yeah. Just till friday.

21:27.690 --> 21:29.280
I'll be back for the weekend.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.070
Could you do me a favor?

21:31.080 --> 21:32.440
Sure. What's that?

21:32.450 --> 21:34.570
- Could you look this over?
- What is it?

21:34.580 --> 21:39.230
It's an unr financial report.
I'd really like your take on it.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.500
- All right, I'll do my best.
- Thanks.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.540
- Brunch on saturday?
- Of course.

21:44.550 --> 21:46.990
- Bye, babe.
- Bye.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.330
We've got less than a week.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.880
Our scope needs to
be more comprehensive.

21:57.910 --> 22:00.770
doug schiff is on our side, but
we need to convince his commission

22:00.820 --> 22:04.260
that this merger should not go through.

22:06.020 --> 22:09.240
Craig, ari, I want to know more
about unr's environmental record.

22:09.250 --> 22:12.360
Look into every state that they've where
they've done business for the last 20 years.

22:12.370 --> 22:14.000
OK.

22:14.020 --> 22:16.690
Ellen, in my office.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.260
Shut the door.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.970
What do you think you're doing?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.240
- About what?
- In there.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.960
You see anyone else checking
their phone while I'm talking?

22:35.800 --> 22:38.200
- No. I apologize.
- Don'T.

22:38.210 --> 22:39.550
Just tell me the truth.

22:39.570 --> 22:42.680
What do you have in your life
that's more important than work?

22:42.730 --> 22:44.700
Nothing. I'm sorry, patty.

22:44.710 --> 22:47.000
I'm not asking you to be sorry.

22:47.050 --> 22:50.190
I'm asking you who called.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.000
- I was late for a meeting.
- What meeting?

22:52.010 --> 22:53.240
Counseling.

22:53.270 --> 22:55.130
- I thought you stopped going.
- To group.

22:55.140 --> 22:58.340
I'm going one-on-one,
twice a week, during lunch.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.810
You're excused, then.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.740
Leave.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.340
Amazing.

23:20.670 --> 23:22.680
What's amazing, babe?

23:22.710 --> 23:26.050
This ultima national merger.

23:27.070 --> 23:29.970
You have a position in it?

23:32.130 --> 23:34.740
This is for patty?

23:34.750 --> 23:38.110
She's circling a case.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.080
- You want to run it by me?
- Do you mind?

23:41.090 --> 23:42.510
Not at all.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.690
Look at these numbers.

23:44.710 --> 23:47.990
Tell me if you see what I see.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.910
Later. We've only got
one item in london.

23:59.590 --> 24:01.830
I thought you were phil.

24:01.860 --> 24:04.040
He went out of town, remember?

24:05.130 --> 24:08.250
- Where?
- London.

24:09.030 --> 24:12.660
London. Again?

24:13.760 --> 24:17.450
Then he's meeting me in
amherst to look at colleges.

24:30.860 --> 24:34.020
How are your applications going?

24:34.030 --> 24:36.490
Did you show phil your essay?

24:36.510 --> 24:38.120
No.

24:38.130 --> 24:40.530
Why not?

24:40.560 --> 24:43.670
It's about daniel purcell.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.080
Why did you do that?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.880
It's supposed to be a personal essay.

24:51.910 --> 24:53.640
He's my father.

24:53.650 --> 24:56.340
What's more personal than that?

24:57.700 --> 25:03.090
I don't want you having anything
to do with him anymore, michael.

25:03.100 --> 25:05.410
For 17 years, you hide him from me.

25:05.450 --> 25:08.410
Then one day, it's all
reunions and smiles.

25:08.450 --> 25:11.270
And now you don't want me to see him?

25:12.690 --> 25:16.240
He betrayed you, mom.
You're human. Get over it.

25:20.970 --> 25:24.080
I've looked into this thing,
patty, and I'm ready to run and gun.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.520
Consider the merger dead.

25:27.270 --> 25:30.010
Well... well, you're welcome.

25:30.020 --> 25:33.470
This is an opportunity
to do some important work.

25:35.600 --> 25:39.490
Hey, it's me. Meet me at the hotel.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.660
I got a joke for you.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.970
Why do birds fly upside down
over the state of west virginia?

25:54.020 --> 25:55.730
Do they?

25:55.770 --> 25:58.370
Well, now you ruined it.

26:00.020 --> 26:03.240
What's this about, mr. Pell?

26:03.550 --> 26:06.230
Your career.

26:07.580 --> 26:10.400
I think I'm being followed.

26:10.410 --> 26:11.510
How do you know?

26:11.520 --> 26:15.470
The other day, i noticed this guy when I met
with you, and then I just saw him again today.

26:15.480 --> 26:18.100
It can't be a coincidence.

26:18.140 --> 26:19.620
You're sure it was the same guy?

26:19.660 --> 26:20.960
Positive.

26:21.020 --> 26:23.340
We're going to want
a written description.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.420
What?

26:27.460 --> 26:30.860
Patty asked me about the
infant mortality case again.

26:31.320 --> 26:35.020
I'm afraid that she'S...
on to me somehow.

26:36.330 --> 26:40.590
Ellen, if you've been
made, we can't continue.

26:40.630 --> 26:43.620
Let me just work her a little
more, okay? Find out for sure.

26:43.630 --> 26:47.610
No. Don't have any contact with her.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.090
- We have to take this to our supervisor.
- Why?

26:51.620 --> 26:55.280
Because there's a very good
chance this operation is over.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.910
Your girl gets around.

27:32.480 --> 27:36.760
- What do you think?
- Could be lawyers.

27:39.110 --> 27:41.680
Look like feds to me.

27:48.630 --> 27:51.990
Why the hell did ferc
authorize the merger?

27:52.030 --> 27:54.350
Believe me, I went went
beyond due diligence here.

27:54.380 --> 27:56.560
- I climbed way out on a limb.
- And?

27:56.570 --> 27:59.870
And even if we could prove that unr was
dumping contaminants-- which we can't--

27:59.890 --> 28:01.820
we still have no proof of
any fraudulent activity.

28:01.830 --> 28:03.030
Bullshit!

28:03.090 --> 28:06.550
There are impact studies from an independent
consulting firm that back up their claim.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.580
Doug, this is me you're talking to.

28:08.620 --> 28:12.210
You know that report is a lie!

28:14.050 --> 28:17.040
There's no evidence, patty.

28:17.400 --> 28:22.040
I feel terrible about this,
but truly, my hands are tied.

28:33.590 --> 28:35.720
Well, I have good news.

28:35.750 --> 28:38.720
The merger's going through.

28:40.080 --> 28:41.980
Congratulations.

28:42.030 --> 28:44.440
Congratulations to you, too.

28:48.160 --> 28:53.360
I invited you here, dan, because
loyalty goes a long way with me.

28:53.750 --> 28:56.640
I see big things in your future.

28:56.650 --> 29:00.350
My future doesn't
particularly concern me, but...

29:00.850 --> 29:03.630
my daughter's does.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.080
Look at me.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.420
Look at me.

29:14.100 --> 29:18.110
Your concerns are my concerns.

29:18.820 --> 29:21.470
You have my word.

29:23.390 --> 29:26.940
You're going to clean up the
mess down in west virginia?

29:29.170 --> 29:31.240
Everything I heard about you is true.

29:31.300 --> 29:35.310
You guaranteed me, you'd stop using
aracite, and you'd clean it up.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.360
It's already happening.

29:39.310 --> 29:42.060
I want you to come and work for us, dan.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.320
I'd like to make you head of research.

29:44.370 --> 29:48.110
Oversee unr's move
to alternative energy.

29:48.140 --> 29:50.380
The merger's through...

29:50.410 --> 29:52.610
that's what you wanted.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.150
Now I'm done.

29:54.170 --> 29:57.640
I know how you feel, dan, but whatever
happened that night in your house,

29:57.670 --> 30:01.090
with your wife, it's
over, it's done with.

30:01.110 --> 30:05.390
You played ball; this
is a partnership now.

30:18.950 --> 30:23.520
I checked into monique bryant, the
client for the infant mortality case.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.280
What did you find?

30:25.330 --> 30:31.310
48 years of age, daughter died
in childbirth, lost the baby, too.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.860
So, ellen's in the clear.

30:32.910 --> 30:36.580
Well, the hospital records check out,

30:36.590 --> 30:40.230
but the plaintiff came in
here was african american.

30:40.870 --> 30:44.300
And this is the real monique bryant.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.880
Ellen's a liability, patty.

30:55.110 --> 30:57.680
I've said it all along.

31:01.630 --> 31:03.930
Yeah?

31:14.220 --> 31:16.900
So, what's so important?

31:21.720 --> 31:27.060
I know you don't trust me, and
you have a very good reason not to.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.330
What reason would that be?

31:31.710 --> 31:34.590
I was approached by the fbi last night.

31:34.610 --> 31:36.140
This isn't the plan.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.370
What the hell is she doing?

31:38.410 --> 31:40.750
What did they want?

31:41.100 --> 31:44.330
They want to use me as
an informant against you.

31:46.490 --> 31:48.080
What's their leverage?

31:48.110 --> 31:52.360
They have pictures of me leaving the
office the night of fiske's suicide.

31:52.370 --> 31:55.730
We never told the
police that i was there.

31:55.750 --> 31:58.600
I told them to go screw themselves.

31:59.380 --> 32:00.870
That was ballsy.

32:00.900 --> 32:04.410
Well, it was clear nothing they
had on me was going to stick.

32:08.310 --> 32:12.990
I think you were right about the
infant mortality case. It was a setup.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.030
They're trying to catch
you paying off a client.

32:22.770 --> 32:25.600
We have to be very careful.

32:25.630 --> 32:28.930
The problem is, the
feds can approach anyone.

32:28.940 --> 32:32.360
Who else in the office is vulnerable?

32:33.800 --> 32:36.380
Good question.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.920
Patty, we're in this together.

32:40.930 --> 32:44.080
They take you down, I go down, too.

32:48.050 --> 32:51.370
She just sold us out.

32:51.590 --> 32:54.020
I decided to tell patty that
I was approached by the feds.

32:54.050 --> 32:55.960
Okay, that was unbelievably stupid!

32:55.990 --> 32:58.420
It was the only way
to win her confidence.

32:58.470 --> 33:00.870
You heard me. I protected my cover.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.640
I told her I refused to
cooperate with you guys.

33:05.380 --> 33:06.630
Did she believe you?

33:06.660 --> 33:09.300
- I think so.
- You think so? That's great.

33:09.310 --> 33:12.380
Hey, hey, relax. Ellen...

33:12.390 --> 33:15.790
Look, she doesn't trust
anyone right now except for me,

33:15.820 --> 33:20.100
so if you still want to get
to her, I'm your only chance.

33:31.590 --> 33:33.030
So, how's your mother?

33:33.090 --> 33:35.230
Oh, I haven't seen her all month.

33:35.270 --> 33:36.810
You need some help with this?

33:36.840 --> 33:39.230
Oh, no, pete. I got it. Thanks.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.720
Listen, patrick...

33:47.880 --> 33:50.310
I gotta cut through the bullshit.

33:50.340 --> 33:52.680
You have to take a vacation.

33:52.710 --> 33:55.010
The heat is on my boss.

33:55.050 --> 33:57.800
It's because of that girl we went after?

34:13.449 --> 34:16.560
My boss could never know about this.

34:22.230 --> 34:27.850
So take this. But you
gotta leave tonight.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.840
Should be enough for
seven, eight months there.

34:51.760 --> 34:55.850
I made a deal. They're
gonna leave us alone now.

34:56.620 --> 34:59.110
If you don't stop them, I will.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.180
No, you won'T.

35:00.210 --> 35:01.400
I'll call the police.

35:01.420 --> 35:02.790
I can't let you do that.

35:02.820 --> 35:06.020
In fact, I'm gonna call the epa.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.210
We're in trouble.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.780
- Do you want my help?
- Yes.

35:26.540 --> 35:29.120
Which one of these is yours?

35:31.880 --> 35:34.660
Is your daughter expected home tonight?

35:34.670 --> 35:39.070
No, she's upstate with her grandparents.

35:41.430 --> 35:43.890
Give me the keys.

35:47.160 --> 35:51.230
okay, go park your car.

35:51.840 --> 35:55.410
20 minutes, this will all be over.

36:10.810 --> 36:14.560
I looked into the unr merger.
It makes no sense financially.

36:14.570 --> 36:16.670
In what way?

36:16.700 --> 36:19.150
It seems to me that kendrick
is grossly overpaying,

36:19.160 --> 36:22.020
and he's too smart not to realize it.

36:22.330 --> 36:23.800
What's his motive?

36:23.840 --> 36:26.760
To consolidate power. But if you
ask me, that's just his first move.

36:26.770 --> 36:29.000
There must be something
else he's getting out of it.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.340
Such as...

36:31.350 --> 36:34.670
Well, that's what
you've got to figure out.

36:36.010 --> 36:39.090
Your friend was right, you
know? I'm under investigation.

36:39.100 --> 36:40.660
The feds are looking into me.

36:40.710 --> 36:43.390
Then you have to forget
about this whole thing.

36:43.420 --> 36:49.640
Patty, kendrick is too well-connected I want
you to promise me that you will leave unr alone.

37:01.050 --> 37:05.280
Detective messer, are
you still down there?

37:05.290 --> 37:08.000
You got my cheeseburger?

37:12.020 --> 37:14.470
- I said extra ketchup.
- It's in there.

37:17.150 --> 37:19.470
Call csu and get the M.E. Down here.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.530
Well, it's worse than you thought.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.790
She's been meeting with someone.

37:39.830 --> 37:42.470
Looks like law enforcement.
I think it's fbi.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.080
Fbi?

37:47.980 --> 37:50.710
What do you want me to do?

37:51.150 --> 37:53.860
5 MONTHS LATER

38:07.170 --> 38:09.830
I think it's flight
number 84 out of newark.

38:10.680 --> 38:13.060
Right.

38:13.070 --> 38:16.350
Can you cancel the reservation for me?

38:17.900 --> 38:20.440
No, that's it. Thank you.

38:21.870 --> 38:23.540
Ellen.

38:23.570 --> 38:25.980
Wes, what's going on?

38:25.990 --> 38:28.800
They're doing some work
at my building. It'S...

38:28.810 --> 38:30.570
do you mind if I crash here tonight?

38:30.610 --> 38:32.600
- Sure.
- Or two?

38:32.890 --> 38:34.860
Maybe three.

38:34.870 --> 38:36.660
Let's just see how the first night goes.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.970
I can live with that.
