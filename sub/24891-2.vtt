00:00.080 --> 00:02.240
<i>Previously on "Six"...</i>
What are you doing here?

00:02.290 --> 00:05.050
It's Rip.
Someone shot him.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.170
He died alone, man.
Rip died alone.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.880
How did you do it,

00:08.880 --> 00:11.250
the shooting of the SEAL
in Virginia?

00:12.800 --> 00:14.800
You will inspire others
to do as you did.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.379
When do I do
the next one?

00:16.379 --> 00:17.720
They shot him
because he was a SEAL.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.390
We're gonna find
whoever did this,

00:19.390 --> 00:21.680
and we're gonna make them pay.

00:24.270 --> 00:26.310
That's Dragan!

00:26.310 --> 00:28.190
I need Dragan alive.
Do you copy?

00:28.190 --> 00:29.940
Clear out now!

00:29.940 --> 00:32.110
- Moving!
- Stand fast!

00:32.110 --> 00:33.650
Bomb! Bomb!

00:36.690 --> 00:40.030
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
You used me. You used my daughter.

00:40.030 --> 00:41.080
Down!

00:44.370 --> 00:46.370
That notebook the SEALs found?
Gold mine.

00:46.370 --> 00:48.880
Dragan and Muttaqi worked
for our favorite ghost.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.340
The Prince.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.540
If you break this guy,

00:51.540 --> 00:53.170
we find the Prince, we stop this.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.420
Who are you?

00:54.420 --> 00:57.130
Hello, Michael.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:34.380 --> 01:36.460
Welcome to the Brotherhood.

01:42.915 --> 01:45.251
I want the Team down here in 10.
Where's Alex?

01:46.020 --> 01:48.480
- He's in the mind gym.
- Then go get him.

01:51.270 --> 01:53.860
<i>Hard part's
learning to not shoot.</i>

02:01.610 --> 02:03.200
<i>Jackpot on our target!
He's egressing north!</i>

02:03.200 --> 02:05.620
<i>On the ground!</i>

02:08.080 --> 02:10.000
<i>Caulder! Hey.</i>

02:10.000 --> 02:11.500
<i>Caulder.</i>

02:11.500 --> 02:15.300
Hey, Alex. You okay?

02:18.210 --> 02:20.510
How's the head feeling?

02:20.510 --> 02:22.180
Medical cleared me, dude.

02:22.180 --> 02:24.550
Bear wants the Team
in the cage room ASAP.

02:24.550 --> 02:26.470
Okay. All right.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.290
Oh, you hit
the pods, dude.

02:47.290 --> 02:49.200
It's "Invasion of
the Body Snatchers"...

02:49.200 --> 02:50.790
Any news from FBI?

02:50.790 --> 02:53.540
Yeah, they're on it.
Atkins says no funeral for Rip.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.590
What?
They don't want us together
in public.

02:55.590 --> 02:58.670
We have to do something for Rip.
Yeah, when the time is right,
we will.

02:58.670 --> 03:02.300
Okay, let's hogwash this VI.
What happened?

03:02.300 --> 03:04.050
What do you mean,
"what happened"?

03:04.050 --> 03:06.220
The Agency is happy we salvaged
the notebook, right?

03:06.220 --> 03:08.680
It might link Nasry to
some Jihadist heavy hitter...

03:08.680 --> 03:11.890
"The Prince."
- Look, the way I see it,

03:11.890 --> 03:15.980
two of my senior guys violated
an SOP written in blood.

03:15.980 --> 03:18.270
We executed the plan, called
an audible when we needed to.

03:18.270 --> 03:20.190
But we went in too hot.
We lost our flow, okay.

03:20.190 --> 03:22.610
Now I understand that we wanna
get payback for Rip,

03:22.610 --> 03:26.160
but we're lucky that nobody
got hurt, or worse.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.700
Now, Buddha,
you pushed too hard.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.490
And, Alex, I ordered you
to come back to our position.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.330
And what'd you expect me
to do? Leave...
You followed...

03:31.330 --> 03:32.710
I expect you to follow orders.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.250
Hey, hey, bro!
We were committed, bro.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.790
No, you got yourself
in a bad way.

03:35.790 --> 03:38.130
And then you made
a piss-poor situation worse

03:38.130 --> 03:40.300
when you ran off after
a squirter with a suicide belt!

03:40.300 --> 03:42.630
We didn't see it!
Hey, that "squirter"
was our HVI.

03:42.630 --> 03:44.550
What were we supposed to do,
just let the guy go?

03:44.550 --> 03:47.760
Hey! What about Mata Hari?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.310
Rolling in hot like that
on a target?

03:49.310 --> 03:51.640
Who was the... CIA chick?

03:53.690 --> 03:55.650
I did a snatch with her
in Bosnia, way back.

03:55.650 --> 03:58.400
We don't want to see her again.

04:37.770 --> 04:41.610
Did he play
the Aztec Death Whistle for you?

04:44.570 --> 04:47.860
The longest anyone's ever been
able to go was 40 hours...

04:47.860 --> 04:51.240
Tariq Al Wazir.
Then he lost his mind.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.290
Oh. Oh.

05:01.290 --> 05:02.880
Okay.

05:07.590 --> 05:11.550
Hmm.

05:11.550 --> 05:13.470
How's your shoulder?

05:13.470 --> 05:17.060
Where am I?

05:20.270 --> 05:23.610
We caught the Jihadist you sent
to kill SEALs in Virginia.

05:23.610 --> 05:26.400
I didn't send anyone.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.900
I was shot in Chad.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.660
Who else have you targeted
in the States?

05:30.660 --> 05:35.200
What does it matter?
You caught the guy.

05:40.420 --> 05:43.250
And him, in Bosnia.

05:43.250 --> 05:46.010
Dragan was connected to you,

05:46.010 --> 05:47.420
and you're connected
to The Prince.

05:47.420 --> 05:51.050
Now you're gonna help me
find him.

05:52.430 --> 05:57.350
You smoke, don't you?

05:57.350 --> 05:58.810
I can smell it on you.

05:58.810 --> 06:00.850
You really shouldn't lie,
Michael.

06:00.850 --> 06:03.110
We traced phone calls to Dragan
from Virginia Beach.

06:03.110 --> 06:04.610
We know he's part
of your boss's network...

06:04.610 --> 06:08.110
Tamerlin Shishoni,
also known as The Prince.

06:09.650 --> 06:12.820
I'm an American citizen.

06:12.820 --> 06:16.370
Oh. Um...

06:16.370 --> 06:18.790
you're not.

06:18.790 --> 06:21.920
You actually don't exist.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.540
I an your only connection
to the world,

06:24.540 --> 06:26.750
and I'm the only person
who can help you.

06:26.750 --> 06:30.050
But you're gonna have
to help me.

06:30.050 --> 06:31.470
Tell me about the Prince.

06:46.690 --> 06:49.860
One of my early postings
was in Bosnia,

06:49.860 --> 06:52.780
hunting a war criminal.

07:00.460 --> 07:04.330
It was a... Serb general

07:04.330 --> 07:07.460
wanted for genocide
against Muslims.

07:07.460 --> 07:11.010
Vince let me run the op,
let me develop the source.

07:11.010 --> 07:12.470
<i>It was all on me.</i>

07:16.430 --> 07:19.350
Who would you shoot first?

07:19.350 --> 07:22.020
You mean after you?

07:25.310 --> 07:28.520
Little weaselly guy
in the corner. The alpha.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.280
Once he falls,
all the puppies will scatter.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.950
Good thing they're on our side.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.490
<i>Al-hamdu lillah.</i>

07:40.040 --> 07:42.080
Your asset's outside.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.330
- Thank you.
- You guys do your homework?

07:45.330 --> 07:47.040
Do you trust this dude?

07:47.040 --> 07:49.000
We vetted him for six months.

07:53.930 --> 07:56.390
He's a SEAL, not a spy.

07:59.220 --> 08:01.180
Does John trust you?

08:01.180 --> 08:03.940
Vince...

08:03.940 --> 08:05.940
"Trust is our currency.

08:05.940 --> 08:10.230
We earn it by any means,
even by lying."

08:14.900 --> 08:19.120
Ah, Gina, my number one spook.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.040
I find General Stankevich
for you.

08:30.460 --> 08:32.260
That's not Stankevich.

08:32.260 --> 08:35.130
You're right. But my special
Christian friend here

08:35.130 --> 08:37.549
knows where dog likes
to bury his bone.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.260
Don't you, Zoran?

08:39.260 --> 08:42.679
Twice a week, General Stankevich
comes over into Bosnia,

08:42.679 --> 08:45.600
for a girl.
Muslim... taste sweeter.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.610
That's why you kill Muslim men,
huh?

08:51.150 --> 08:54.610
You will take us to Stankevich.
Your boyfriend?

08:54.610 --> 08:58.570
Senior management, John.
That's how important you are.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.660
Bring him.

09:04.660 --> 09:06.580
Let's go.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.470
<i> Approaching
unidentified vehicle.</i>

09:16.470 --> 09:18.010
Park. That car over there.

09:18.010 --> 09:20.470
Ah, they're here.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.650
John, what's going on?
Where's Stankevich?

09:32.690 --> 09:35.650
I want you to meet my family.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.790
Eyes peeled, Ricky.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.300
Wha-paa!

10:04.810 --> 10:10.230
This is my wife, Amina
and my son, Little John.

10:10.230 --> 10:11.940
What are we doing here, John?

10:18.320 --> 10:20.200
This is my blood.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.240
You will take care of them, yes?

10:22.240 --> 10:24.200
Bring them to St. Louis?

10:24.200 --> 10:27.540
That was our deal, remember?

10:27.540 --> 10:30.830
You bring me Stankevich,
I'll take care of all of you.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.630
Get in the car.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.600
- Better than Chechen food?
- We're in Macedonia, right?

10:45.600 --> 10:48.220
The Tavce Gravce.

10:48.220 --> 10:51.060
It's not bad.

10:53.690 --> 10:57.480
My asset from Bosnia... John,
a.k.a., Tamerlin Shishoni.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.820
But you know him as The Prince.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.530
The Prince...

11:02.530 --> 11:04.780
was your lover, wasn't he?

11:04.780 --> 11:08.080
You have no more cards
to play here. None.

11:10.450 --> 11:13.500
I've met a few princes.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.420
That guy?

11:15.420 --> 11:17.710
He looks like
a Russian gangster.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.180
No!

11:30.180 --> 11:33.140
No. No, no, no.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.770
Sweet dreams, Michael.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.170
Stop it!

12:29.690 --> 12:32.400
Hey, it's just bodily fluids.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.860
Well, keep 'em to yourself.

12:34.860 --> 12:37.650
Hey. Hey.

12:37.650 --> 12:39.530
Yeah.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.410
Come on, you just made my
blood pressure spike, baby girl.

12:42.410 --> 12:43.740
I'm sure.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.040
You're a mess. You know,
you should clean yourself up.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.250
Stay.

12:56.250 --> 12:59.090
I have a case.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.820
Don't let Atkins catch you
with classified... down here.

13:16.820 --> 13:18.440
Yeah.

13:20.950 --> 13:24.450
Hey, can you guys
give us a minute, please?

13:31.290 --> 13:33.920
So what's up?

13:33.920 --> 13:35.750
Rip would have never
taken us to task

13:35.750 --> 13:39.460
in front of the Team like that.

13:39.460 --> 13:42.470
Well, Rip's not Team Leader
anymore.

13:42.470 --> 13:44.800
He hasn't been for two years.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.970
Yeah.

13:46.970 --> 13:50.770
See you at the kill house,
Senior Chief.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.330
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

14:12.330 --> 14:18.500
I am Michael Nasry.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.840
I am Michael Nasry!

14:34.980 --> 14:39.690
I... am Michael Nasry.

14:39.690 --> 14:42.190
Good to know.

14:44.030 --> 14:45.700
I have to go to the bathroom.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.030
You'll go when I tell you to.

14:48.030 --> 14:50.450
I have something I wanna
show you.

15:12.890 --> 15:15.730
Are there other targets?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.780
You know, there are other ways
we can do this.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.120
Let's go back to Bosnia.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.080
I don't care about Bosnia.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.420
Yeah, we'll see about that.

15:43.800 --> 15:47.800
The house is empty.
No Stankevich.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.300
Get across the border.
We're going to Serbia.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.630
G-Gina, no, I'm not going
to Serbia.

16:29.630 --> 16:31.760
You... you know what they do
to do my people there.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.760
Stankevich is
a... butcher.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.470
They will kill me
if they find me there.

16:35.470 --> 16:38.690
I'm not going!
You wanna go to America?
You're going.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.610
Hey! What are...

16:51.660 --> 16:55.660
He betrayed us. Me.

16:55.660 --> 16:58.830
His sandbox. His rules.

17:10.550 --> 17:13.510
Alex.

17:15.140 --> 17:16.349
Alex!

17:17.470 --> 17:19.849
Hi, dude.

17:19.849 --> 17:22.480
You all right?

17:22.480 --> 17:25.109
Oh. She was a hellion.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.980
Who?

17:26.980 --> 17:29.900
- Uh, Jenkins, the, uh...
- Hot JAG chick.

17:29.900 --> 17:32.030
Are you still getting
those headaches?

17:32.030 --> 17:34.870
Your fertility surgery...
How'd the pre-op go, man?

17:34.870 --> 17:37.540
I scheduled it
in a couple months.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.250
You really think having
a kid's gonna fix things?

17:39.250 --> 17:41.160
Screw you, okay?

17:43.580 --> 17:45.170
Uh...

17:45.170 --> 17:46.590
- Yeah, you want a beer?
- Yeah, dude.

17:46.590 --> 17:49.210
Put some clothes on.

17:53.180 --> 17:54.970
<i>I'm sorry I never met
your Sarah, Bear.</i>

18:05.020 --> 18:07.230
Don't talk about
my daughter, okay?

18:07.230 --> 18:10.190
<i>Somebody has to,
'cause you won't.</i>

18:12.650 --> 18:15.370
Yeah.
<i>What, you think cutting into
your...</i>

18:15.370 --> 18:17.740
<i>makes you a better husband?</i>

18:17.740 --> 18:19.740
<i>Or having a child actually
makes you a better father?</i>

18:19.740 --> 18:23.750
<i>No. No, no, no, no, no.
It doesn't work that way.</i>

18:23.750 --> 18:27.090
<i>That's why we love the big suck.</i>

18:27.090 --> 18:29.750
<i>Clarity of combat.</i>

18:29.750 --> 18:33.170
<i>The crystal clear immediacy
of what we do.</i>

18:33.170 --> 18:37.930
<i>Life, death, Alpha and Omega,
and everything in between.</i>

18:37.930 --> 18:42.390
<i>Your wife? Your little Sarah?</i>

18:42.390 --> 18:46.310
<i>None of that... matters.</i>

18:48.400 --> 18:51.780
No. That ain't me.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.530
That's <i> you.</i>

18:55.070 --> 18:57.160
<i>I am you.</i>

18:58.870 --> 19:02.000
Yo, yo.

19:08.790 --> 19:10.460
Uh...

19:10.460 --> 19:12.300
You squeeze too tight, bro.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.630
Just let her go.
Let the universe do its thing.

19:14.630 --> 19:16.470
Let's get some food.

19:16.470 --> 19:19.970
Okay.

19:19.970 --> 19:23.310
Hey, I thought we were
eating together.

19:23.310 --> 19:25.190
- Hey.
- Where's Anabel?

19:25.190 --> 19:27.310
Thought she was with you.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.810
No.

19:29.810 --> 19:32.320
Anabel?

19:35.530 --> 19:37.820
Anabel!

19:39.820 --> 19:42.240
Anabel!

20:08.520 --> 20:11.150
What are you doing?

20:11.150 --> 20:12.730
Please do not tell Mom.
Don't tell Mom.

20:12.730 --> 20:16.690
Stop right there.
Stop right there. Stop!

20:16.690 --> 20:18.700
Who gave you this?

20:18.700 --> 20:21.530
Who gave you this ...?

20:24.200 --> 20:26.580
Please don't tell Mom.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.540
Get in the house.

20:44.560 --> 20:48.430
<i> Marissa, you are
the heart of our new Jihad.</i>

20:48.430 --> 20:51.060
<i>The path we have taken together
is lonely,</i>

20:51.060 --> 20:53.610
<i>but the rewards,
both in Heaven and on Earth,</i>

20:53.610 --> 20:55.610
<i>will prove immeasurable.</i>

20:55.610 --> 20:58.240
<i>You will be one
of my proud lionesses,</i>

20:58.240 --> 20:59.990
<i>fighting for the oppressed,</i>

20:59.990 --> 21:05.740
<i>proving your worth every day
to Allah, and to me.</i>

21:30.400 --> 21:32.270
Little-known fact...

21:32.270 --> 21:34.990
Jeb Stuart, late for Gettysburg.

21:34.990 --> 21:36.610
Well-known fact...

21:36.610 --> 21:38.240
The guys who start sentences
with "little-known fact,"

21:38.240 --> 21:39.870
they got little...

21:39.870 --> 21:42.080
Is that true, Peanut?

21:42.080 --> 21:45.450
"Peanut."
That one's gonna stick.

21:45.450 --> 21:47.410
All right, boys,
we start without Graves.

21:47.410 --> 21:48.580
- Caulder, you're good on point?
- When have I not been?

21:48.580 --> 21:49.920
Let's rock and roll.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.420
Sorry.
Drowning in Admin bull....

21:53.420 --> 21:54.960
We're ready to start
without you.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.760
- Oh, good. Chase, breach.
- No, I'm gonna breach.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.130
No, Chase is gonna breach
'cause Chase needs the practice.

21:59.130 --> 22:00.840
Let's go.

22:46.470 --> 22:50.350
Drop! Cease fire!

22:50.350 --> 22:52.940
Buddha, you just got
yourself shot. Congratulations.

22:52.940 --> 22:54.480
- You got ahead of me.
- You have to pick up the pace.

22:54.480 --> 22:57.280
Yeah, let's reset this, please.

23:28.560 --> 23:29.850
Caulder.

23:29.850 --> 23:32.140
Reset.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.330

23:56.330 --> 23:57.920

Aah!

24:29.450 --> 24:31.910
Alex.

24:34.460 --> 24:36.250
Dad? Dad?

24:36.250 --> 24:38.590
Dad! Dad!

24:41.250 --> 24:43.670
Joe, what do we do?
Joe, what do we do?

24:43.670 --> 24:46.430
Don't let him die!

24:46.430 --> 24:49.260
Come on. Alex. Come on.

24:49.260 --> 24:52.470
Alex! Alex, wake up!

24:52.470 --> 24:55.100
We need to call 9-1-1 now!

24:55.100 --> 24:56.770
Alex! Dharma, listen to me.

24:56.770 --> 24:58.600
It is okay.
I've seen this before.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.440
I need you to flush anything
that is not Advil and aspirin.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.940
- Do you understand me?
- We need to call 9-1-1!

25:01.940 --> 25:04.070
If it is not Advil or aspirin,
you flush it.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.320
Okay, Pretty Boy.

25:07.320 --> 25:10.320
Come on! Open your eyes.
Open your eyes, please.

25:10.320 --> 25:15.540
Hey.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.830
Okay. Okay. Is it oxy?

25:18.830 --> 25:21.340
Yeah. Yeah.

25:21.340 --> 25:23.420
This is the last time.

25:23.420 --> 25:26.090
Do you understand what
I am saying?

25:26.090 --> 25:28.590
Okay.
I'm not covering your ass
anymore. Do you understand me?

25:30.970 --> 25:32.810
This is the last time.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.480
Remember what the Prophet,
peace be upon Him, said.

25:55.480 --> 26:00.560
"O, you who believe,
enter absolutely into peace."

26:00.560 --> 26:06.150
Michael, peace is
the heart of Islam.

26:06.350 --> 26:09.520
You must enter it absolutely.

26:34.380 --> 26:37.470
How long has the Imam
worked for the CIA?

26:37.470 --> 26:41.100
He came to us when ISIS killed
his wife and children.

26:43.220 --> 26:45.850
How many wives and children
have your drones,

26:45.850 --> 26:49.730
your Special Forces,
your cruise missiles killed?

26:49.730 --> 26:52.940
Too many.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.770
The only way we end this war

26:54.770 --> 26:58.240
is one moral decision at a time.

26:58.240 --> 27:01.240
I've been opening up to you.
Now you have to open up to me.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.990
Where is the Prince?

27:04.990 --> 27:07.250
I want something in return.

27:07.250 --> 27:12.380
If I cooperate fully,
I want out.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.790
You arrange that,

27:14.790 --> 27:16.250
I'll tell you who the Prince is

27:16.250 --> 27:19.260
and how to find him.

27:23.090 --> 27:24.720
No can do, Mike.

27:27.430 --> 27:29.980
Wait. Hey. Hey!

27:29.980 --> 27:31.980
Come back here! I...

27:31.980 --> 27:33.770
I said... I said
I'll tell you who he is.

27:33.770 --> 27:36.610
I-I said I'll tell you
who he is!

27:36.610 --> 27:39.690
I said I'll tell you who he is.

27:39.690 --> 27:41.400
I'll give you...

27:41.400 --> 27:44.660
I said I'll tell you who he is!
I said I... I said I...

27:44.660 --> 27:47.200
I'll tell... tell...

27:55.040 --> 27:56.540
We're across the border.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.670
Pull up
to that tree up ahead.

27:58.670 --> 28:01.630
Keep it tight,
boys.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.070
<i> Testing,
testing communications.</i>

28:22.750 --> 28:24.090
Vince...

28:24.090 --> 28:26.220
Be careful, old man.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.220
Keep an eye on John.

28:28.220 --> 28:30.510
I'm not that old.

28:32.730 --> 28:34.651
Ortiz, take us out.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.652
On me.

28:37.940 --> 28:41.270
Hey, come on. Let's go.

29:07.380 --> 29:09.630
Vince, post up.

29:15.140 --> 29:18.100
<i> We're in position.
SEALs moving toward target.</i>

29:32.410 --> 29:33.990
<i>Clear so far.</i>

30:06.660 --> 30:07.740
Damn you!

30:07.740 --> 30:09.580
Man:
They knew we were coming!

30:09.580 --> 30:11.500
- This wasn't me, Gina!
- Did you screw us?

30:11.500 --> 30:13.670
Swear to God, I did not
do this. Gina, please!

30:13.670 --> 30:15.250
It wasn't me. Gina, no,
please, listen. Listen!
Are there more coming?!

30:15.250 --> 30:17.420
Listen, it wasn't me!

30:20.170 --> 30:21.210
Uhh!

30:40.230 --> 30:41.730
You ready for this, Bear?

30:43.820 --> 30:46.070
I'm not usually much
for talking,

30:46.070 --> 30:48.320
but let me tell you a story
about Rip,

30:48.320 --> 30:51.160
about what kind of a man he was

30:51.160 --> 30:53.280
and what he taught us.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.910
Right after I graduated
from Green Team,

30:55.910 --> 31:00.080
Delta was doing some
kill house training at Shaw's.

31:00.080 --> 31:04.170
Right after we finished,
Rip took us to this, uh...

31:04.170 --> 31:07.550
this honky-tonk bar.

31:07.550 --> 31:11.930
Well, the... the local boys
did not appreciate us

31:11.930 --> 31:13.970
as much as the local girls did.

31:13.970 --> 31:16.850
So we had to bust some heads
and make a run for it.

31:16.850 --> 31:21.520
And the cops...
The cops, they stopped us,

31:21.520 --> 31:23.900
and then Rip just steps up

31:23.900 --> 31:27.980
and... and he takes the hit
for... for me,

31:27.980 --> 31:30.150
for the whole Team.

31:30.150 --> 31:33.280
And they put him in the lock-up
for two days.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.580
The Command were gonna take
his Trident away.

31:36.580 --> 31:42.670
And he did that because the Team
mean...

31:42.670 --> 31:48.670
The Team meant <i> everything
</i> to him.

31:48.670 --> 31:51.170
At the risk
of everything else...

31:51.170 --> 31:56.300
His promotions, his career...

31:56.300 --> 31:58.810
his family.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.440
He loved us.

32:06.440 --> 32:12.110
- This...
- This, uh...

32:12.110 --> 32:14.320
Guess that's it.

32:26.170 --> 32:29.170
Yeah, Big Boy.
I got you.

32:29.170 --> 32:31.670
Okay, um...

32:31.670 --> 32:33.550
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with this one. Huh?

32:33.550 --> 32:35.390
Okay, right?

32:35.390 --> 32:37.550
- Is that a small?
- So... Richard Taggart.

32:39.100 --> 32:43.690
Richard Taggart was a hard-ass.

32:43.690 --> 32:46.100
Ahh.

32:46.100 --> 32:51.030
Rip put me through BUD/s.

32:51.030 --> 32:57.030
He handpicked each and every one
of us to fight with him.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.490
So, uh...

33:03.370 --> 33:06.040
I love you, man.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.920
We love you,

33:07.920 --> 33:10.880
and we will never forget you.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.260
That's right.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.930
We will never forgive

33:18.930 --> 33:21.890
and we will bury the bastards
who did this to you.

33:26.270 --> 33:31.610
You know, I had a different
relationship with Rip than...

33:31.610 --> 33:34.030
most people got to experience,
right?

33:38.110 --> 33:42.290
We had our moments,
you and I, man.

33:42.290 --> 33:46.250
I wanna continue
this conversation one day.

33:54.420 --> 33:57.260
I'm gonna miss you.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.770
Be well, brother.

34:09.980 --> 34:12.940
All right?

34:16.610 --> 34:20.110
- Hey.
- That was nice, Joe.

34:24.449 --> 34:27.290
I'm, uh...

34:27.290 --> 34:30.170
I'm glad you... glad you came.

34:30.170 --> 34:33.210
Well...

34:33.210 --> 34:37.130
he was going to be
Sarah's godfather,

34:37.130 --> 34:39.719
and he was my friend.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.800
- Come here. Come here.
- Joseph.

34:41.800 --> 34:45.600
What?
I need you to stop sleeping
outside my sister's place.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.810
I went to see a surgeon,

34:50.810 --> 34:52.860
and I got an appointment
in a couple months,

34:52.860 --> 34:54.440
and we'll able to have
another baby together,

34:54.440 --> 34:56.150
like you wanted.
- I need to figure things out.

34:56.150 --> 35:00.110
- Like you wanted.
- For myself.

35:00.110 --> 35:01.910
We need to spend
some time apart.

35:01.910 --> 35:05.830
We're doing that.
Well, maybe...
maybe see other people.

35:05.830 --> 35:08.580
What?

35:08.580 --> 35:10.370
Okay, Lena, we...
We have been together

35:10.370 --> 35:12.880
since we were 16 years old.
- I-I know, but that...

35:12.880 --> 35:14.380
You don't come to
Rip's... wake...

35:14.380 --> 35:16.920
- That is not...
- and say to me...

35:16.920 --> 35:18.670
that you wanna see other people.

35:18.670 --> 35:21.680
Things have to change.
We have to change.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.850
Hey, Hey. Hey.

35:27.850 --> 35:31.600
Well, I-I-I will.
I will change.

35:31.600 --> 35:35.520
- I will change. Look at me.
- We'll see.

35:35.520 --> 35:38.570
- We'll have to see.
- Yeah, okay. Okay.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.150
- That's cool.
- I'm gonna go.

35:40.150 --> 35:42.030
That's cool. Yeah.

36:01.380 --> 36:04.390
<i>It's lonely at the top, Joe.</i>

36:04.390 --> 36:06.970
<i>It's real lonely at the top.</i>

36:06.970 --> 36:10.270
<i>You got a long row to hoe,

36:10.270 --> 36:11.980
<i>I wish I could tell you that</i>

36:11.980 --> 36:13.730
<i>I'd be there with you
every step of the way.</i>

36:13.730 --> 36:16.440
<i>But the truth is, you gotta
take this walk by yourself,</i>

36:16.440 --> 36:19.610
<i>with no God to believe in,</i>

36:19.610 --> 36:23.030

<i>and a long-gone daddy</i>

36:25.490 --> 36:28.410
<i>that you will never make proud.</i>

36:28.410 --> 36:34.120
What did you know about
being a father, huh?

36:34.120 --> 36:39.170
You couldn't do it, could you?

36:39.170 --> 36:43.590
You couldn't do any of it.

36:43.590 --> 36:48.550
So... I want you...

36:48.550 --> 36:51.430
to leave me alone.

36:51.430 --> 36:54.270
I want you to go away now.

36:59.270 --> 37:02.030
<i>I'm only here because you
want me here, son.</i>

37:11.620 --> 37:13.160
Yeah.

Your father's cancer is back.

39:04.340 --> 39:06.670
Stage III. He lost
his insurance last year,

39:19.850 --> 39:21.560
<i>It wasn't me, Gina!</i>

39:21.560 --> 39:23.690
<i>Did you screw us?!
Are there more coming?</i>

39:23.690 --> 39:25.020
Are there more coming?

39:30.070 --> 39:31.530
Uhh!

39:35.280 --> 39:37.700
Get in the van!

39:39.500 --> 39:42.920
- This is it!-
- Get in the van!

39:42.920 --> 39:46.210
Go! Go! Go! Go!

39:46.210 --> 39:47.500
Get us out of here!
Come on! Go! Go!

39:47.500 --> 39:49.090
Gina...

39:49.090 --> 39:50.590
We're moving back
towards Bosnia. One wounded.

39:50.590 --> 39:54.260
Vince, hang on.
There's so much blood.

39:54.260 --> 39:56.350
- Put pressure on.
- Any eyes on John?

39:56.350 --> 39:57.890
<i> Negative.</i>

39:57.890 --> 40:00.230
John burned us.
Where is that son of a bitch?

40:00.230 --> 40:02.730
- He ran northeast.
- Can we get a team out there

40:02.730 --> 40:04.900
to track down the asset?

40:04.900 --> 40:06.900
Vince, I'm right here.
Vincent.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.190
<i>Negative. It's too hot. We'll
have to come back tomorrow.</i>

40:09.190 --> 40:11.740
Oh, no!

40:11.740 --> 40:13.860
No.

40:13.860 --> 40:18.580
No. Oh.

40:39.100 --> 40:42.310
Vince <i> was</i> your lover.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.400
John betrayed me.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.610
The FSB put out a story
that he was murdered.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.070
We think there's a possibility

40:50.070 --> 40:52.440
the Russians helped him
become "The Prince".

40:52.440 --> 40:54.740
That's quite a story.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.030
But it has nothing
to do with me.

40:56.030 --> 40:57.780
Right.

40:57.780 --> 41:01.410
You know that avatar.
Golden Boy. The Prince.

41:01.410 --> 41:05.460
Where is he?

41:05.460 --> 41:07.380
He ordered your death, Michael.

41:07.380 --> 41:11.550
He told Muttaqi to give you
to Boko Haram.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.720
Where is he?

41:16.970 --> 41:19.550
And my end of the deal?

41:21.560 --> 41:22.970
We will make sure that you have

41:22.970 --> 41:25.690
a very comfortable life
in confinement.

41:25.690 --> 41:27.150
Your father will get
the best care,

41:27.150 --> 41:29.810
and depending on
how cooperative you are,

41:29.810 --> 41:32.480
I will make sure that you
get to see your family.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.200
Put her on.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.790
Woman:
<i>Michael? Are you there?</i>

41:44.790 --> 41:46.710
<i>You think he can hear me?</i>

41:46.710 --> 41:49.130
<i>Baby, please. talk to me.</i>

41:49.130 --> 41:52.000
<i>Your father's dying.
Come home.</i>

41:57.180 --> 42:01.010
He killed the one person
I trusted.

42:01.010 --> 42:03.220
He tried to kill you.

42:06.140 --> 42:10.400
Help me find him.
