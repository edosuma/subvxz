ANDRE:
Something's happening
in my neighborhood.

00:06.315 --> 00:07.616
There's more money
on the streets...

00:07.649 --> 00:08.818
-(gunshot)
-...more shootings.

00:08.918 --> 00:10.052
-(laughs)
-(shouts)

00:10.086 --> 00:11.220
It's called "rock."

00:11.253 --> 00:12.621
What are you doing?

00:12.654 --> 00:14.156
Getting you packed up,
taking you to school.

00:14.256 --> 00:15.657
JULES:
You think bringing our child

00:15.758 --> 00:17.659
into the middle of this
is safe?

00:17.760 --> 00:19.896
I can keep you both clear of
the more dangerous parts of it.

00:19.929 --> 00:22.298
-Hi.
-TONY: Who exactly is
Teddy McDonald?

00:22.331 --> 00:24.133
He also went under an alias:

00:24.166 --> 00:25.734
"Reed Thompson."

00:25.768 --> 00:27.469
Track him down,

00:27.503 --> 00:29.939
you'll find out
what happened to my agent.

00:36.412 --> 00:38.414
HERNAN: We might not be able
to leave after all.

00:39.782 --> 00:41.617
He threatened to kill me.

00:43.285 --> 00:45.287
I'll go to school.

00:45.321 --> 00:47.323
Come on. I only got
one more night left with you.

Shit, you got your six.
It's time for my nine.

01:34.236 --> 01:35.671

01:35.704 --> 01:37.473
Uh, you know

01:37.506 --> 01:39.141
Other than my dick?

01:41.577 --> 01:44.180
Yo, you just gonna do me

No, I'm fresh out.

What's happened?

03:57.479 --> 03:59.881
-You've been sick, ma'am.
-(sighs)

03:59.982 --> 04:02.684
Awful sick.

04:02.718 --> 04:04.353
Have I?

04:04.386 --> 04:07.289
Two, three days now, you...
-(sighs)

MELODY:

(Melody moaning, panting)

04:45.327 --> 04:48.330
(moaning) Don't stop.

04:48.364 --> 04:49.831
Right there, Franklin.

04:49.865 --> 04:51.867

05:06.882 --> 05:08.850
Take it.

05:10.219 --> 05:12.088

cartoon sound effects playing)

I am Edward,
prince of tyranny...

...defender of
innocent citizens

(dog barking, kids chattering
playfully in distance)

05:54.096 --> 05:55.631
Where's my fucking car?

05:55.664 --> 05:57.299
(bicycle bell dings)

06:02.638 --> 06:05.073
(ticking)

06:06.742 --> 06:09.077
-ANDRE: I'm gonna kill her.
-NIX: Goddamn.

06:09.111 --> 06:11.680
Little Melly-Mel,
stealing cars now.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.482
They grow up so fast.

06:13.515 --> 06:15.584
Oh, her little ass thinks
she's slick.

06:15.617 --> 06:17.486
Thinks she's bulletproof
'cause she's going to college,

06:17.519 --> 06:18.987
but she got
another think coming.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.456
Hey, slow down.

06:20.489 --> 06:22.258
Here. Drink.

06:22.291 --> 06:25.494
Come on, big guy.

06:25.527 --> 06:27.028
Attaboy.

06:27.129 --> 06:29.331
All right, so what do we know?

06:29.365 --> 06:31.099
(breathes deeply)

06:31.133 --> 06:33.702
Karina said Eva came in
around 2:00 a.m.,

06:33.802 --> 06:36.338
so that mean Mel must have
come in, took the keys,

06:36.372 --> 06:38.874
then went out joyriding
in my goddamn car.

06:38.974 --> 06:40.776
VICKS:
How have things been at home?

06:40.809 --> 06:42.611
You two been arguing a lot
recently?

06:42.644 --> 06:45.113
Hey, the last dipshit
to raise a 17-year-old

06:45.147 --> 06:48.884
without an argument was
Helen Keller's old man, so...

06:48.984 --> 06:50.786
Seeing as how you're not exactly

06:50.819 --> 06:54.055
the most agreeable son of
a bitch, maybe she ran away?

06:54.156 --> 06:56.057
Why would she run away now?

06:56.158 --> 06:57.526
I'm supposed to drive her

06:57.559 --> 06:59.461
clear across the country
this afternoon.

06:59.495 --> 07:02.364
You can't get much farther away
unless you had a goddamn boat!

07:02.398 --> 07:05.734
Did she have a boyfriend?

07:05.834 --> 07:07.736
No.

07:07.836 --> 07:10.306
Well, we're already running
the APB and running your plates.

07:10.339 --> 07:13.475
Don't worry.
We're gonna find her.

07:13.509 --> 07:15.477
Hell yeah, we're gonna find her.

07:15.511 --> 07:17.513
And then I'm-a kill her.

07:18.580 --> 07:20.582
(phone ringing)

07:24.353 --> 07:26.021
Yeah. Hello.

-Damn.

07:52.614 --> 07:55.684

07:55.717 --> 07:57.886
-Pros did this.
-Pros?

07:57.919 --> 07:59.688
Mm-hmm.

07:59.721 --> 08:01.723

tearing apart a carcass.

08:01.757 --> 08:03.759
Jesus.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.303
What the fuck is that?

08:14.403 --> 08:16.872
It's Melody's nail.

08:16.905 --> 08:18.307
Oh, shit.

08:31.086 --> 08:33.221
You know y'all broke
my granny front door

08:33.255 --> 08:34.823

08:34.923 --> 08:37.493

08:37.593 --> 08:39.395

-No, you not.

08:39.428 --> 08:42.063
She 83. Damn near gave her
a heart attack.

08:42.097 --> 08:43.999
I promise you,
that was an accident.

08:44.099 --> 08:46.001
Accident? (laughs)

08:46.101 --> 08:48.804
Yeah. It's a lot of those
around here, huh?

08:48.837 --> 08:50.506

08:50.606 --> 08:52.341
After y'all broke her door,

08:52.441 --> 08:54.776
smokers ran up in there,
stole her TV.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.612
Now she can't even
watch her stories.

08:56.645 --> 08:59.515
Okay, look, I am truly sorry,

08:59.615 --> 09:01.783
but I'm looking for my daughter.

09:01.817 --> 09:03.985
And I'm looking
for my granny TV.

09:05.287 --> 09:07.255
I guess

09:07.289 --> 09:09.090

09:09.124 --> 09:12.260
Yeah, I get it.
Y'all don't like me.

09:12.294 --> 09:15.331
But that ain't got nothing
to do with my daughter.

09:15.364 --> 09:17.333
(laughs) Hey, cuz.

09:17.366 --> 09:20.836
PKs-- preachers' kids
and pigs' kids.

09:20.869 --> 09:22.471
Them the ones
you got to watch out for.

09:22.504 --> 09:25.206
-What's that supposed to mean?
-I don't know what to tell you.

09:25.307 --> 09:29.878
All I do know is,
if you really knew her,

09:29.978 --> 09:32.681
you damn sure wouldn't be
looking for her around here.

09:32.714 --> 09:35.651

-MAN: That's it. That's it.

got to do with my breakfast.

something like th...
-Yes. Please.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.365
(chatter stops)

12:39.535 --> 12:41.670
Sorry to bother y'all
this Sunday morning,

12:41.703 --> 12:43.705
but I was looking for...

12:43.739 --> 12:45.473
You're looking for
one ass whupping.

12:45.507 --> 12:47.576
-That's what you're looking for.
-State your business, Andre.

12:47.676 --> 12:50.478
Mel didn't come home last night.

12:54.516 --> 12:57.385
Was hoping
Franklin might know something.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.690
If you could tell me anything,
anything at all...

13:01.723 --> 13:03.659
-(mutters)
-Hey.

13:04.926 --> 13:07.529
ANDRE:
Anything at all.

13:09.531 --> 13:12.000
I know if I was leaving
to go to college,

13:12.033 --> 13:15.203
after I'd done everything that
everybody had ever asked of me,

13:15.236 --> 13:17.739
including holding down a job
my senior year,

13:17.773 --> 13:20.041
getting all "A"s,

13:20.075 --> 13:23.444
I'd appreciate if my pops
cut me a bit of slack.

13:23.545 --> 13:26.247
She stole my car,
and I found it stripped.

13:26.281 --> 13:29.450
Looks like signs of a struggle.

13:29.551 --> 13:32.688
You still want to talk
about slack?

13:32.721 --> 13:34.723
Look, I'm hoping
that you got a better read

13:34.756 --> 13:37.593
on where she could be than I do.

13:37.626 --> 13:39.628
I know you all are close.

13:46.401 --> 13:48.403
I'll ask around.

13:49.404 --> 13:51.406
Sorry to bother y'all.

14:05.987 --> 14:08.456
Franklin, find that girl.

14:08.489 --> 14:10.491
*

14:17.498 --> 14:20.335
-(birds chirping)
-(kids shouting playfully)

14:20.435 --> 14:22.170
(rap music playing
over car stereo)

14:22.270 --> 14:23.905
* 'Cause I relax and chill *

14:23.939 --> 14:26.241
* But ready to ill
if you're up in my grill *

14:26.274 --> 14:28.576
* So just step back,
stay on the crack *

14:28.610 --> 14:31.279
* And check the funky rhythm
that my deejay scratch... *

14:31.312 --> 14:33.314
-(honks horn)
-(music stops)

14:36.117 --> 14:38.586
(house door opens)

14:38.620 --> 14:40.856
-(door closes)
-(sighs)

14:40.956 --> 14:43.859
-I see Sunday starting off
with some bullshit already.
-Mm.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.593
That's just fine.
The last thing I need

14:45.627 --> 14:47.595
is Andre knocking
on my mama front door.

14:47.629 --> 14:49.130
Yeah, that'd be all bad.

14:49.164 --> 14:51.099
Where you think she at?

14:51.132 --> 14:53.201
Why everybody think
I know where she is?

14:53.301 --> 14:54.703
-'Cause that's your girl.
-Shit.

14:54.803 --> 14:56.772
She ain't been my girl
for a minute.

14:56.805 --> 14:59.107
Hey, the first nigga through
the door always got a key.

14:59.140 --> 15:01.509
-And Andre know it.
-Mm-hmm.

15:03.344 --> 15:04.780
(engine starts)

15:04.813 --> 15:06.547
* 'Cause I don't need
a nameplate *

15:06.648 --> 15:08.383
* When the brothers say "ho,"
ladies say... *

15:08.483 --> 15:09.384
(radio station changes)

15:09.484 --> 15:12.053
(woman singing gospel song)

15:14.990 --> 15:16.858
-What?
-I know your ignorant ass

15:16.892 --> 15:19.127
ain't about to smoke
to no damn gospel music.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.897
You in a glass house, homey.
Put your stone down.

15:21.997 --> 15:23.732
At least I got
a spiritual practice.

15:23.832 --> 15:25.233
Shut your ass up.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.136
"Spiritual practice."

15:28.169 --> 15:30.706
(chuckles)
You're going to hell.

15:30.739 --> 15:32.640
(gospel song continues)

15:32.674 --> 15:34.642
(both laughing)

15:36.644 --> 15:38.847
Eva would've stayed with Mel,
we wouldn't be in this shit.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.882
Nigga, don't be bitter
she was with Maurice last night

15:40.916 --> 15:42.417
and not your ass.

15:42.517 --> 15:44.519
Hey, right here.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.388
-Nigga, you ain't slick.
-What you talking 'bout, Lee?

15:47.422 --> 15:49.925
Stay your ass from my chair
is what I'm talking about.

15:50.025 --> 15:53.328
Fatback, open the door.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.497
Ha-ha! What up, Saint?

15:56.531 --> 15:57.665
-Mm!
-What you doing?

15:57.699 --> 16:00.902
I'm not doing anything.
(exclaims)

16:00.936 --> 16:03.071
-Maurice.
Where he stay at again?
-Mm. Oh.

16:03.104 --> 16:04.239
You know Reece.

16:04.272 --> 16:06.107
He stay knee-deep in some pussy.

16:06.207 --> 16:07.776
Say he does.
Where can I find him?

16:07.876 --> 16:09.778
Hmm. Where he at?

16:09.878 --> 16:11.446
There? Over there?

16:11.546 --> 16:13.414
Nigga, don't act like you
wasn't following him around

16:13.448 --> 16:16.184
like a fat-ass puppy waiting for
him to drop some pussy crumbs.

16:17.385 --> 16:18.754
Damn.

16:18.787 --> 16:20.588
You act like folks
can't change, homey.

16:20.621 --> 16:22.423
FRANKLIN:
Mel ain't come home last night.

16:22.457 --> 16:24.292
Heard she hooked up with Reece.

16:24.392 --> 16:26.694
Ain't nobody seen her since.

16:26.728 --> 16:27.896
Shit.

16:27.929 --> 16:29.597
(sighs):
Uh...

16:30.698 --> 16:32.367
All right, matter of fact,

16:32.400 --> 16:35.103
I think he's been staying
with his grandmama off Western.

16:35.136 --> 16:37.138
-Thought you ain't know
where he was.
-No.

16:37.238 --> 16:38.740
That ain't for sure, but...

16:38.774 --> 16:41.042
What, you need me
to roll up on him,

16:41.076 --> 16:42.477
send him a message?

16:42.577 --> 16:44.445
Nah, nothing, like that.
Just put the word out.

16:44.479 --> 16:46.714
Anybody find Mel,
tell 'em to hold her,

16:46.748 --> 16:48.283
page me or Lee.

16:48.316 --> 16:51.086
-All right.
-(clears throat) Hey, Saint?

16:51.119 --> 16:53.154
Nigga, don't you see
some grown folks talking?

16:53.254 --> 16:55.590
Dang. Stall me out, Lee.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.625
You got something to say,
Eager Kid, say it.

16:57.658 --> 16:59.594
-Hold on, why you calling me
eager, man?
-'Cause you

16:59.627 --> 17:01.897
fucking eager, nigga, speak.

17:01.930 --> 17:03.498
I saw her this morning
with Wanda.

17:03.598 --> 17:05.266
(scoffs)
Wanda who?

17:05.300 --> 17:07.068
FATBACK:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wanda Bell

17:07.102 --> 17:08.937
-Don't Tell-Ass Wanda?
-Yeah.

17:08.970 --> 17:10.471
What were they doing?

17:10.505 --> 17:12.507
I don't know,
they just got in a car together.

17:12.607 --> 17:14.575
-What time?
-It was like,

17:14.609 --> 17:16.644
-like 7:30.
-You mean to tell me you saw Mel

17:16.677 --> 17:20.015
-get in a car with Wanda
at 7:30 in the fucking morning?
-Yes.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.683
Come on.

17:26.354 --> 17:27.823
FATBACK:
Stupid. (laughs)

17:27.856 --> 17:29.357
Damn.

17:29.457 --> 17:32.260
If Mel with Wanda,
that only mean one thing.

17:32.293 --> 17:34.329
-Rock.
-(laughs)

17:34.362 --> 17:36.331
-What's so funny?
-Come on, man,

17:36.364 --> 17:37.632
we talking about Mel.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.100
Yeah, we also talking
about rock.

17:39.134 --> 17:41.436
Yeah, but M... Mel ain't Wanda.

17:41.469 --> 17:43.271
What you saying?

17:43.304 --> 17:45.040
Is Wanda going to Spelman?

17:45.140 --> 17:48.276
-Shit, is Mel?
-Look, let's just find her,
all right?

17:48.309 --> 17:50.879
-You think Mel too good
to smoke rock?
-You think Eva's

17:50.979 --> 17:53.714
-too good to smoke rock?
-Eva's ass ain't with Wanda.

17:53.815 --> 17:55.783
-Eva went to church
this morning.
-That's what I'm saying.

17:55.817 --> 17:58.186
Eva and Mel are strong,
and that's why they're friends.

17:58.219 --> 17:59.821
Wanda, she's
always been fucking weak.

18:01.222 --> 18:03.391
I called Wanda everything
but a child of God,

18:03.491 --> 18:04.960
but one thing she ain't is weak.

18:04.993 --> 18:07.195
Man, what you think,
we making all this money

18:07.228 --> 18:08.864
'cause this shit
ain't addictive?

18:08.897 --> 18:11.699
Once the rock
get ahold of they ass,

18:11.732 --> 18:14.335
the person you knew, they gone.

18:14.369 --> 18:16.304
-Slave to the pipe now.
-Look,

18:16.337 --> 18:18.173
I know you've been
through it with Wanda.

18:18.206 --> 18:19.841
I know that she's real to you.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.642
What you mean, real to me?

18:21.676 --> 18:24.512
I know that shit hurt you,
but you got to get over it.

18:24.545 --> 18:26.915
-'Cause Wanda's gone.
-Yeah, and if Mel is
with her ass,

18:27.015 --> 18:28.149
then she gone, too.

18:30.886 --> 18:32.420
Well, maybe you're right.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.655
Maybe I ain't over her.

18:34.689 --> 18:36.657
But you're lucky I'm not,

18:36.691 --> 18:39.227
'cause maybe I know
where to find Wanda.

18:48.904 --> 18:50.405
LEON:
Look, nigga, I already know

18:50.438 --> 18:52.607
you've been fucking her,
so that means you know

18:52.707 --> 18:54.042
exactly where the fuck she at.

18:54.075 --> 18:55.877
Nigga, ain't nobody fucking
no smokers.

18:55.911 --> 18:57.946
Shit, and even if I was,

18:58.046 --> 18:59.847
I ain't telling
your punk ass shit!

18:59.881 --> 19:01.249
MANBOY:
Goddamn.

19:01.282 --> 19:03.384
You Westside niggas
sure got a problem

19:03.418 --> 19:04.785
with keeping
y'all bitches in line.

19:04.886 --> 19:06.087
This ain't about no bitch.

19:06.121 --> 19:09.024
Mel's pops is LAPD.

19:09.057 --> 19:12.127
Find her before he does
and having a cop owe us a favor,

19:12.227 --> 19:13.794
that's just good business.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.065
Hey, Bootsy, tell these niggas

19:17.098 --> 19:19.200
how you be getting
ahold of Wanda.

19:19.234 --> 19:20.902
How many times
I got to tell y'all?

19:20.936 --> 19:23.204
Ain't nobody still fucking
with no Wanda.

19:23.238 --> 19:25.206
Nigga, you lying.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.075
Everybody know Wanda
be humming the alphabet

19:27.108 --> 19:28.443
when she sucking dick.

19:28.476 --> 19:30.912
And I'll be damned if your ass
ain't been strolling

19:30.946 --> 19:32.914
in this motherfucker,
humming on the regular.

19:32.948 --> 19:35.583
Sound like one of them niggas
from Sesame Street.

19:35.616 --> 19:36.918
Nah.

19:36.952 --> 19:39.887
Shit, the alphabet
was last month.

19:39.921 --> 19:42.490
She be humming
"Happy Birthday" now.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.792
-She be humming, nigga?
-Don't make me ask you again

19:44.825 --> 19:46.661

19:47.996 --> 19:50.631
BOOTSY:
I don't know exactly

19:52.067 --> 19:56.004
But I do know
where she cop her rock from.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.406
Bo and Lamont.

19:58.439 --> 19:59.907
Who they?

19:59.941 --> 20:02.110
Lee, that's your neighborhood,
ain't it?

20:03.144 --> 20:05.080
Hey, look, don't worry about it.

20:05.113 --> 20:08.283
I make it a point to know
all the hustlers, big and small.

20:09.317 --> 20:11.319
I can take you straight to 'em.

20:12.620 --> 20:13.989
Good.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.661
MANBOY:
Like, trust me,
if I would've known how bad

20:20.695 --> 20:22.697
you had it for Wanda,
I would've never let Bootsy

20:22.797 --> 20:23.864
put his hands on her.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.500
Fuck you talking 'bout?

20:25.533 --> 20:27.202
I'm just saying, bro.

20:27.302 --> 20:30.205
I think a man should never put
his hands on a woman.

20:30.305 --> 20:32.440
Nigga like me...

20:32.473 --> 20:34.275
I'm just saying.

20:35.843 --> 20:38.313
I just follow orders.

20:38.346 --> 20:41.949
Franklin say get rid of her,
that's what I'm-a do.

20:41.983 --> 20:44.986
How I'm supposed to know
Bootsy gonna take it that far?

20:45.020 --> 20:47.555
Shit, one thing
about Wanda is she tough.

20:47.655 --> 20:49.057
She know how to take a punch.

20:49.157 --> 20:50.858
You ever get tired
of hearing yourself talk?

20:50.891 --> 20:52.227
Not really.

20:52.327 --> 20:54.895
Hey, Drew, how you know
these folks again?

20:54.996 --> 20:56.531
I don't.

20:56.564 --> 20:59.134
LEON:
Oh, shit.

20:59.167 --> 21:00.501
FRANKLIN:
Fuck.

21:00.535 --> 21:03.071
* A lyrical monster... *

-You Bo or Lamont?

21:13.248 --> 21:14.749
I ain't nobody
unless you buying.

21:14.849 --> 21:16.517
You know who I am?

21:16.551 --> 21:18.686
* To ever handle a mic,
the strongest in a fight *

21:18.719 --> 21:20.521
* You've ever seen

21:20.555 --> 21:22.323
Shit. Okay, I got you.

21:22.357 --> 21:23.891
We're looking for two girls.

21:23.924 --> 21:25.826
One of 'em might've had
this sweatshirt on.

21:25.860 --> 21:29.164
The other one's Wanda-- we know
she gets her rock from y'all.

21:29.197 --> 21:30.831
Who the fuck is Wanda?

21:30.865 --> 21:33.368
MANBOY:
Brown skin. She got big lips.

Yeah.

21:46.781 --> 21:49.016
Yeah, she was up here earlier
with some other broke bitch.

21:49.050 --> 21:51.018
What'd the other girl look like?

21:51.052 --> 21:52.187
Cute.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.521
BO:
Cute?

21:53.554 --> 21:55.423
Nigga, that bitch
was fine as shit.

21:55.456 --> 21:57.558
Slim, long hair, about five-six?

21:57.592 --> 21:58.959
Uh-huh.

21:59.060 --> 22:01.462
Yeah, something like that.

22:01.562 --> 22:02.930
* DJs love to spin
everything... *

22:02.963 --> 22:04.732
Was she bleeding?

22:04.765 --> 22:06.401
Nah.

22:06.434 --> 22:08.035
* I was born to do this
and do it all the time... *

22:08.069 --> 22:09.637
Where they at?

22:09.737 --> 22:12.373
LAMONT:
Mm. Aw, shit.

22:12.407 --> 22:15.310
Let me find out y'all niggas up
here tripping over some bitches.

22:15.410 --> 22:17.078
-Man, come on.
-(laughter)

22:17.112 --> 22:19.114
This ain't
no fucking game, nigga!

22:19.147 --> 22:20.981
He asked you a question.

22:21.082 --> 22:23.651
Nigga, fuck you.

22:23.751 --> 22:26.287
Where the fuck they at, nigga?

22:26.321 --> 22:28.589
-Speak, nigga!
-Y'all steal any cars today?

22:28.623 --> 22:30.825
BO:
Nigga, we hustlers, a'ight?

22:30.925 --> 22:32.727
Nigga, that's my granny purse.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.994
Leon, shoot this motherfucker.

22:34.095 --> 22:35.396
-Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait-wait...
-(pager beeping)

22:35.430 --> 22:38.399
Just put that shit down
and-and let me explain.

22:38.433 --> 22:39.634
Explain!

22:39.667 --> 22:41.836
-Hey, Saint!
-(dialing)

22:41.936 --> 22:43.971
(line ringing)

22:44.004 --> 22:45.005
Saint.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.342
FRANKLIN:
What's up?

22:47.442 --> 22:49.244
* You never let 'em
see you sweat *

22:51.612 --> 22:54.014
* You never let 'em
see you sweat... *

22:54.115 --> 22:55.316
(slams phone)

22:57.485 --> 23:00.288
Leon, let's go.
They found her.

23:00.321 --> 23:01.989
She all right?

23:02.022 --> 23:03.824
No.

23:08.663 --> 23:11.266
Checking in with our
morning traffic report.

23:11.299 --> 23:12.300
-(snoring)
-(door opens)

23:12.333 --> 23:13.334
(door closes)

23:16.437 --> 23:18.873
(sighing)

23:21.976 --> 23:23.378
...all major commuter routes,

23:23.478 --> 23:25.346
including the 405
and 10 freeways.

23:25.380 --> 23:29.517
It seems that Mayor Bradley's
plan to increase public transit

23:29.550 --> 23:32.820
and the fact that many people
have simply stayed off the road

23:32.853 --> 23:34.822
has paid off in a big way.

23:34.855 --> 23:36.857
(newswoman speaking
indistinctly on TV)

23:53.541 --> 23:55.543
(Andre snoring)

24:05.753 --> 24:07.755
(indistinct newscast continues
on TV)

24:09.257 --> 24:11.559
(Andre sighs)

24:18.199 --> 24:20.201

(indistinct chatter)

24:36.351 --> 24:37.952
(turns engine off)

24:39.754 --> 24:41.589
(indistinct chatter in distance)

24:46.561 --> 24:47.695
-Hey, Mel!
-Shit.

24:47.728 --> 24:50.064
-What you doing here?
-What? (sighs)

24:50.097 --> 24:52.132
Looking for $20 worth of rock.

24:52.233 --> 24:54.735
Shit! $20?

24:54.769 --> 24:56.036
-Shit.
-What you doing?

24:56.070 --> 24:57.204
That's all?

24:57.238 --> 24:58.473
Wanda, no.

24:58.573 --> 25:00.275
Ooh.

25:00.308 --> 25:02.710
This is nice.
This real leather?

25:02.743 --> 25:04.479
Hello? What do you want, Wanda?

25:04.579 --> 25:08.983
Oh, um... these niggas,
they-they stingy with the rock.

25:09.083 --> 25:11.218
-I know somewhere we can get
more for our money.
-We?

25:11.252 --> 25:13.988
-Yeah, if you want some rock,
it's got to be we.
-Wanda, everybody know

25:14.088 --> 25:16.123
-you ain't got no damn money.
-Nah, nah, see,

25:16.156 --> 25:18.626
my cousin, he owe me $20,
so, then,

25:18.659 --> 25:22.830
we gonna have $40 soon
as you take me to go get it.

25:24.299 --> 25:26.133
-Come on.
-Shit.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.406
-It better not be far.
-No.

25:31.439 --> 25:33.341
-Right around the corner.
-Damn.

25:33.441 --> 25:35.476
(starts engine)

25:35.510 --> 25:37.612
Look at Keisha.
Hey, Keisha!

25:37.645 --> 25:39.179
(chuckles)

25:40.315 --> 25:42.283
(indistinct chatter)

25:42.317 --> 25:44.319
Cool, cool, cool.

25:52.192 --> 25:54.161
That's why I don't fuck with
niggas from Long Beach no more.

25:54.194 --> 25:56.531
-Hey, just stop right here.
It's this house right here.
-Shh.

25:56.631 --> 25:57.765
* Call you up and talk... *

25:57.798 --> 25:59.367
-Damn.
-Who would've thought?

25:59.467 --> 26:02.837
Wanda Bell and Pretty Girl Mel.

26:02.870 --> 26:05.272
* Pick you up
and take you out... *

26:05.306 --> 26:06.541
-(squeals)
-Wanda.

26:06.641 --> 26:08.509
I'm only gonna say this once.

26:08.543 --> 26:10.545
Don't play with me or my money.

26:10.645 --> 26:12.713
(laughs): Don't play you?
Girl, I thought we was girls.

26:12.813 --> 26:14.649
You thought wrong.
This is a simple transaction.

26:14.682 --> 26:16.283
So you ain't
gonna smoke with me?

26:16.317 --> 26:17.818
No, Wanda, I got shit to do.

26:17.852 --> 26:19.487
Okay, so, then I'm
gonna take your $20,

26:19.520 --> 26:21.556
then run in my cousin's house
and get my $20,

26:21.656 --> 26:24.325
then we gonna have $40,
and then we can run to this spot

26:24.359 --> 26:25.726
and cop and have enough rock

26:25.826 --> 26:27.395
-for the day!
-As fun as that sounds,

26:27.495 --> 26:29.229
-I'm going to college today.
-College?

26:29.330 --> 26:31.566
Where you going, CSUN?

26:31.666 --> 26:35.235
-Spelman.
-Damn! That's far as shit!

26:35.336 --> 26:37.304
You know, my aunt went there,
but she gay,

26:37.338 --> 26:39.306
-so she loved it.
-Look, I am just grabbing some

26:39.340 --> 26:41.642
to take with me so I can party
like I'm still at home.

26:41.676 --> 26:44.044
Right, thank you. Okay,
so I'm gonna be right back.

26:44.078 --> 26:45.680
Don't go nowhere.

26:45.713 --> 26:47.247
I'll be right back.

26:47.348 --> 26:50.084
Oh, my God.
(sighs)

26:50.184 --> 26:52.387
Shit.

26:53.754 --> 26:55.923
(sighs)

26:56.023 --> 26:57.692
Goddamn, girl.

26:57.725 --> 26:59.394
-You cute as shit.
-Yeah!

26:59.427 --> 27:00.895
-Kick rocks, ho,
get the fuck out the car.
-Whoa-- wait, wait.

27:00.928 --> 27:02.397
-Get the fuck out the car.
-N-No, wait, wait!

27:02.430 --> 27:03.664
-Wait! Wait!
-Get the fuck out.

27:03.698 --> 27:05.165
Wait, n-n-no-no,
wait, wait, please.

27:05.199 --> 27:06.601
Come on, this is my daddy's car.

27:06.701 --> 27:08.569
-Shit, fuck him.
-Please don't take-- n-n-n-no.

27:08.603 --> 27:09.937
Wait, let's talk about this.

27:10.037 --> 27:10.838
-Don't take my daddy's car.
-You'll be all right.

27:10.871 --> 27:12.339
No, no, no, no, no! No, no!

27:12.373 --> 27:14.274
Stop! Shit!

27:15.275 --> 27:16.911
Fuck! Oh, my God, he's gonna...

27:16.944 --> 27:19.346
Relax, girl,
they always play like that.

27:19.380 --> 27:21.015
Ain't nobody play
like that, Wanda!

27:21.048 --> 27:23.050
Bitch, your daddy the police.
You really think

27:23.083 --> 27:25.920
-they dumb enough
to steal his car?
-Fuck. Fuck.

27:25.953 --> 27:27.855
Where the hell you get that?!

27:27.888 --> 27:29.690
-My cousins.
-Your cousins?

27:29.724 --> 27:32.460
-Damn, you slow.
-You said your cousins
owed you money,

27:32.560 --> 27:34.929
and we had to get the rock
from somewhere else.

27:34.962 --> 27:37.565
-Fuck! Damn!
-Bitch, you want to play
20 questions, or you want

27:37.598 --> 27:40.968
-to smoke this rock?
-Ain't nobody trying
to smoke right now, Wanda! Damn!

27:41.068 --> 27:42.970
Girl, you ain't making
no sense at all.

27:43.070 --> 27:44.104
(Melody exhales)

27:45.139 --> 27:47.141
My daddy gonna kill me.

27:47.241 --> 27:49.477
He gonna whup my ass.

27:49.577 --> 27:51.111
Fuck.

27:51.145 --> 27:54.582
At least
he can't kill you twice.

27:54.615 --> 27:57.552
Damn. Ain't nobody trying
to smoke that.

27:57.585 --> 28:00.421
-(exhales) Shit!
-Look, we gonna chill out

28:00.455 --> 28:02.790
and smoke, and by the time
we finish, they gonna come back

28:02.823 --> 28:04.391
and w... we gonna be done.

28:04.425 --> 28:06.293
Shut up! If you don't shut
the fuck up, Wanda...

28:06.326 --> 28:07.462
Probably went to get
some Fatburger.

28:07.495 --> 28:09.129
Man, ain't nobody...

28:11.098 --> 28:13.434
I'm only gonna ask
one more time.

28:13.468 --> 28:15.736
-(exhales)
-Get high with me.

28:15.770 --> 28:17.171
Fuck.

28:19.173 --> 28:22.743
(flicking lighter repeatedly)

28:25.412 --> 28:27.414
(birds chirping)

28:32.086 --> 28:34.188
(Wanda laughing)

28:35.189 --> 28:37.191
*

28:54.809 --> 28:57.011
-You still high?
-Huh?

28:58.713 --> 29:00.815
That's a nice-ass necklace.

29:02.016 --> 29:04.451
My mama gave it to me.

29:04.485 --> 29:05.720
Is it real?

29:05.820 --> 29:07.287
Yeah, it's real.

29:07.321 --> 29:09.624
My mama had class.

29:09.657 --> 29:11.726
Huh.

29:11.826 --> 29:13.894
I'm thirsty.

29:13.994 --> 29:16.296
Me, too.

29:16.330 --> 29:18.799
You sure you ain't got
no more money?

29:19.800 --> 29:21.201
No.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.740
But I do know a place
we can get free drink

29:25.840 --> 29:27.875
and free food.

29:27.908 --> 29:30.511
-Can we smoke there?
-Uh-huh.

29:30.545 --> 29:31.746
Is it heaven?

29:31.846 --> 29:33.313
Yeah, bitch, let's go.

29:33.347 --> 29:34.314
(laughing)

29:34.348 --> 29:37.217
Get my lighter.

29:37.251 --> 29:39.219
WANDA:
Damn!

29:39.253 --> 29:42.723
This place is big as shit
when it's empty.

29:42.757 --> 29:44.091
("Sail On" by Commodores
playing)

29:44.191 --> 29:46.527
What size shoe you wear?

29:46.561 --> 29:47.928
Six.

29:48.028 --> 29:50.164
Bitch, ain't no way
you wear a six.

29:50.197 --> 29:52.066
Eight and a half.

29:54.101 --> 29:55.570
Eight and a half.

29:55.603 --> 29:56.571
Right there.

29:56.604 --> 29:57.705
First things first.

29:59.540 --> 30:02.276
* Don't really wanna know *

30:02.376 --> 30:04.378
* Where you're goin' *

30:05.613 --> 30:09.083
* Maybe once or twice, you see *

30:09.116 --> 30:11.752
* Time after time I tried *

30:11.786 --> 30:14.722
* To hold on to what we got *

so good. *

This is, like,
the greatest day of my life.

31:24.291 --> 31:26.761
(chuckles)
We can come whenever you want.

31:26.794 --> 31:28.796
As long as it's before 5:00.

31:34.334 --> 31:36.837
* Let the sun beat me
getting home... *

31:36.871 --> 31:39.006
What happened to that last rock?

31:40.307 --> 31:43.043
(chuckles):
I think we smoked it.

31:43.143 --> 31:45.612
* When I finally got there... *

31:45.646 --> 31:48.282
Look, Mel,
it's-it's been fun and all,

31:48.315 --> 31:51.485
really, but I'm-a need you
to come up off of that necklace.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.320
(chuckles)
What?

31:53.353 --> 31:55.956
* There was a note
that said... *

(grunts)

31:57.024 --> 31:58.025
* I've taken Junior *

What the fuck is your problem?

32:00.527 --> 32:02.830
(panting)

32:02.863 --> 32:05.966
* Won't be back no more, no *

32:06.000 --> 32:07.668
No, Wanda,
that's my mama's necklace...

32:07.702 --> 32:09.303
* I found somebody who knows *

32:09.336 --> 32:12.239
* How to get home *

32:12.339 --> 32:15.375
* Before the break of day *

32:15.409 --> 32:18.478
* And, oh... *

32:18.512 --> 32:21.215
* I fell asleep one time... *

32:27.521 --> 32:29.724
Get the fuck
up out of here, Wanda.

32:29.757 --> 32:31.158
This shit faker
than a three-dollar bill.

32:31.191 --> 32:32.659
No, no, no, this is real gold.

32:32.693 --> 32:35.195
I'll give you a rock for it.

32:35.229 --> 32:37.331
A rock?!
Man, come on, man.

32:37.364 --> 32:39.333
You-you know
how good this'll look

32:39.366 --> 32:40.768
around your girl neck.

32:40.868 --> 32:43.437
-Come on! Oh...
-I said I'll give you a rock.

32:43.537 --> 32:45.740
-I can call you
at this number, right?
-WANDA: Fuck you!

32:45.773 --> 32:48.542
Okay, baby,
I'll call you, I'll call you.

32:50.711 --> 32:52.079
So, what's up, Mel?

32:54.214 --> 32:56.050
What the fuck you gon...?

32:57.551 --> 32:59.553
Give me the fucking necklace.

33:07.094 --> 33:09.696
Hey, homey...

33:09.730 --> 33:11.398
I'm sorry.

33:11.431 --> 33:13.901
I didn't want
this shit to be true.

(car doors close)

33:31.551 --> 33:33.487
You sure it's her?

33:34.621 --> 33:37.057
Go get your girl, Saint.

33:44.164 --> 33:45.599
(dog barking)

33:47.667 --> 33:49.904
(car alarm blaring)

33:53.841 --> 33:55.843
(woman shouting nearby)

33:58.312 --> 34:00.314
(groans)

34:05.452 --> 34:07.454
(indistinct chatter
and clattering)

34:14.294 --> 34:16.296
(coughing)

34:21.802 --> 34:23.804

34:26.640 --> 34:28.642

34:32.546 --> 34:34.548
(woman coughing)

34:38.052 --> 34:40.354
(woman giggling)

34:44.558 --> 34:46.326
-(door creaks)
-(kissing)

34:46.360 --> 34:48.562
Close the fucking door.

34:50.564 --> 34:52.867
(lighter flicking)

34:56.203 --> 34:58.372
(man coughing)

35:15.689 --> 35:18.258
(Melody humming)

35:26.666 --> 35:29.103
-Mel.
-(gasps) Franklin?

35:29.203 --> 35:30.404
Franklin!

35:30.437 --> 35:32.539
(laughs):
I'm so happy to see you.

35:32.572 --> 35:35.442
Oh, I like it
when you take charge.

35:35.542 --> 35:37.177
Oh, Franklin...

35:37.211 --> 35:39.279
Whoa. Whoa. Franklin.

35:39.379 --> 35:41.281
(laughing):
Where we going?

35:41.381 --> 35:43.283
-We're going home.
-Why are we gonna go home?

35:43.383 --> 35:45.085
I was having fun.

35:45.119 --> 35:47.521
Franklin, Franklin, I miss you.

35:47.554 --> 35:49.356
I missed you so much.

35:49.389 --> 35:52.526
Oh! Oh! Bye, girl!

35:52.559 --> 35:54.628
Ooh, I like to touch.

35:54.728 --> 35:56.730
What? Lee?

35:56.763 --> 35:58.198
What up, Lee?

35:58.232 --> 35:59.866
You came to see me, too?

35:59.900 --> 36:01.701
(panting):
Oh. Damn.

36:01.735 --> 36:02.869
I forgot something.
I'll be right back.

36:02.903 --> 36:04.471
-No, no.
-Franklin, wait!

36:04.571 --> 36:05.906
-Why don't you just relax?
-You're coming with us.

36:05.940 --> 36:07.574
-That's out.
-Baby, why don't you just relax?

36:07.607 --> 36:09.476
Wait. Wait.

36:09.576 --> 36:11.645
Hey! Fuck! Let me go back!

36:11.745 --> 36:13.480
Franklin, let me go back!

36:13.580 --> 36:15.282
Why don't you... Franklin!

36:15.315 --> 36:16.716
What the fuck
is your problem! No!

36:16.750 --> 36:18.218
-Get in the fucking...
-Damn! What the fuck

36:18.252 --> 36:19.253
is your problem?!

36:19.286 --> 36:21.588
Franklin, fuck!

36:21.621 --> 36:24.724
You never let me have
any fucking fun!

36:24.758 --> 36:27.327
Hate this shit!
(sobbing)

36:27.427 --> 36:29.930
You never let me have
any fun in here!

36:29.964 --> 36:32.266
You never let me have any fun.

36:32.299 --> 36:34.434
(Melody laughing)

36:34.468 --> 36:36.136
Are you mad?

36:36.170 --> 36:38.072
You mad at me now.

36:38.105 --> 36:39.673
I'm in trouble.

36:39.773 --> 36:41.275
Uh...
(laughs)

36:41.308 --> 36:42.642
(starts engine)

36:42.676 --> 36:44.979
You're a fucking asshole,
Franklin.

36:45.012 --> 36:46.613
(laughs)

36:57.291 --> 36:59.626
Muévese.

37:11.471 --> 37:13.473
(muffled conversation nearby)

37:20.847 --> 37:22.216
(sighs)

37:22.316 --> 37:24.284
-(door closes)
-(keys clatter)

37:32.026 --> 37:34.028
(screams)

37:34.061 --> 37:36.130
(children scream)

37:37.831 --> 37:39.833
(bystanders speaking Spanish)

38:22.676 --> 38:24.944
Run away with me.

38:25.045 --> 38:27.281
(snickers)

38:27.381 --> 38:30.050
With the duffel bags or without?

38:34.221 --> 38:36.223
You're serious?

38:38.458 --> 38:40.760
Do you remember our first date?

38:40.794 --> 38:42.462
-(chuckling)
-What?

38:42.562 --> 38:43.897
Don't do that.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.532
-Don't do this.
-You take me horseback riding

38:45.565 --> 38:47.967
in...
(speaks foreign language)

38:48.068 --> 38:49.969
except you don't want
to horseback-ride.

38:50.070 --> 38:51.938
The horse was crazy.
It wouldn't listen to anyone.

38:51.971 --> 38:54.274
-In English or in Persian.
-(laughs): And so you decide

38:54.308 --> 38:55.742
to follow behind on foot.

38:55.775 --> 38:57.144
In my defense,

38:57.244 --> 38:59.379
no one told me that horses
kick backwards.

38:59.413 --> 39:01.648
Who doesn't know horses
kick backwards?

39:01.748 --> 39:02.882
Goddamn thing
could've killed me.

39:02.916 --> 39:05.152
(Jules laughs)

39:05.252 --> 39:07.554
And despite having
a bruised sternum...

39:07.587 --> 39:11.758
when you realized I'd been
thrown off... (laughing)

39:11.791 --> 39:14.094
you were overwrought.

39:14.128 --> 39:15.662
Overwrought?

39:15.762 --> 39:17.964
-That's-that's not my way.
-(laughing)

39:17.997 --> 39:20.600
(both laughing)

39:20.634 --> 39:22.502
Oh...

39:22.602 --> 39:26.773
For weeks I couldn't figure out
if it was, um, sexist or...

39:26.806 --> 39:29.476
if you were the nicest guy
I'd ever met.

39:31.178 --> 39:33.413
And after...

39:33.447 --> 39:36.450
a few months, uh...

39:38.352 --> 39:41.621
I didn't care.

39:41.655 --> 39:44.158
Because I was in love.

39:46.760 --> 39:49.363
After everything
we've been through,

39:49.463 --> 39:54.134
I didn't think
I could feel like that again.

39:56.636 --> 39:59.206
I was wrong.

40:01.875 --> 40:03.643
You said you want it all.

40:05.279 --> 40:08.282
Well, I'm offering you
the chance to have it all.

40:08.315 --> 40:12.886
Me, Paul... us.

40:14.454 --> 40:17.123
And the job, of course.

40:18.558 --> 40:20.860
Just not here.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.566
Yeah, but I can't leave here,
Jules, you know that.

40:26.666 --> 40:28.535
I think you can, Teddy.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.972
Money for the Contras
is pouring in.

40:33.006 --> 40:35.475
The arms sale in Taiwan.

40:35.509 --> 40:38.178
Cash from the Middle East.

40:38.212 --> 40:40.180
The Saudis alone
are contributing

40:40.214 --> 40:43.082
a million dollars a month.

40:43.183 --> 40:45.985
You've done enough here.

40:46.019 --> 40:48.154
You've risked enough.

40:48.188 --> 40:52.091
Shit, Teddy. (sighs)

40:53.260 --> 40:56.162
There are other ways to serve.

41:01.868 --> 41:03.503
Like where?

41:20.620 --> 41:23.523
You know Spelman is named
after a white woman?

41:29.062 --> 41:31.965
Rockefeller's wife.

41:35.769 --> 41:38.472
Thanks for the ride.

41:40.206 --> 41:44.110
So... I guess this is it, hmm?

41:44.143 --> 41:47.547
At least until Christmas break.

41:52.319 --> 41:55.154
What happened to your necklace?

41:58.492 --> 42:01.661
I must have lost it
at the party.

42:06.666 --> 42:08.768
Hey, you gonna miss me?

42:11.137 --> 42:12.739
Jesus Christ.

42:13.973 --> 42:15.575
-Hey, Mel, hey.
-(car door opens)

42:15.609 --> 42:17.176
(car door closes)

42:17.277 --> 42:18.678
Hey. Oh, my God, Jesus Christ.

42:18.778 --> 42:20.980
Oh, you had me worried sick.

42:21.014 --> 42:23.182
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay. I'm just--
Can we talk about this later?

42:23.283 --> 42:25.585
ANDRE:
Hell no, we can't talk
about it later.

42:25.619 --> 42:27.787
MELODY:
Daddy, I'm tired.
I have a headache

42:27.821 --> 42:30.590
and I just need some rest.

42:30.624 --> 42:32.359
ANDRE:
The fuck?

42:34.361 --> 42:36.363
Where did you find her?

42:37.931 --> 42:40.300
If I was you...

42:41.335 --> 42:44.304
I wouldn't let that girl
out of my sight.

42:44.338 --> 42:46.940
(door closes)

42:49.142 --> 42:52.546
What the fuck just happened?

42:59.886 --> 43:02.221
Hold on.

43:07.394 --> 43:11.164
Hey! What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

43:12.999 --> 43:15.735
It means I don't want
to talk about it.

43:15.835 --> 43:18.137
Don't want to talk about it?

43:18.171 --> 43:21.040
Mel. Melody.

43:21.074 --> 43:23.510
What happened?

43:23.543 --> 43:26.212
Is she okay?

43:26.245 --> 43:27.714
No.

43:29.916 --> 43:33.086
She on the rock now.

43:36.189 --> 43:37.824
ANDRE:
Melody Nicole Wright.

43:37.857 --> 43:41.828
You'd better answer me
when I'm talking to you.

43:41.861 --> 43:44.330
(panting)

43:44.364 --> 43:48.502
Daddy, where's my fucking
money?!

44:10.056 --> 44:12.892
* Once I had a little girl *

44:15.061 --> 44:18.765
* Sometimes I think about her *

44:20.366 --> 44:22.135
* But you know *

44:22.235 --> 44:28.374
* She's not really there... *

44:29.809 --> 44:32.579
* When memories do call *

44:34.548 --> 44:39.886
* I just, I just can't live
without her *

44:39.919 --> 44:42.789
* But tryin' all the time *

44:42.822 --> 44:47.226
* Is so hard to bear *

44:47.260 --> 44:51.565
* Heartbreaker *

44:51.598 --> 44:57.270
* Can't take her *

44:57.303 --> 45:01.140
* Heartbreaker. *
