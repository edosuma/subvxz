01:22.915 --> 01:24.683
No, don't do this!
Don't do it!

01:24.750 --> 01:27.802
No! No! No!

01:27.887 --> 01:31.940
No! Why are you
doing this?!

01:32.024 --> 01:33.625
Get me out of here!

01:33.693 --> 01:36.561
Where'd you go?

01:38.431 --> 01:39.648
Why are you doing this
to me?!

01:39.732 --> 01:41.333
Please don't do this,
man.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.468
No!

01:43.536 --> 01:45.971
No, please!

01:46.038 --> 01:47.872
Can't somebody
help me?

01:47.940 --> 01:49.741
Help me!

01:50.743 --> 01:52.344
No!

02:00.619 --> 02:03.355
Help!

02:17.353 --> 02:20.105
Hey, Jack, are you ready?
We gotta go.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.325
Hey, where's the costume?

02:23.409 --> 02:24.659
It's itchy.

02:24.744 --> 02:27.379
Did you try the long sleeves
on underneath?

02:27.446 --> 02:29.381
I don't want to be
Spider-man anymore.

02:29.448 --> 02:30.882
Why not?

02:30.950 --> 02:32.317
I don't know.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.886
Ok. Well, you have to make up
your mind by tomorrow, ok?

02:34.954 --> 02:36.688
Ok.
Ok.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.556
You did a good job
on the cookies.

02:38.624 --> 02:39.874
Teamwork, right?

02:39.959 --> 02:41.259
Teamwork, right.

02:42.561 --> 02:44.963
Can I have one?

02:45.014 --> 02:47.365
You want a cookie?

02:47.433 --> 02:48.733
Can I have a cookie?

02:50.236 --> 02:52.270
What do you want,
black cat or a pumpkin?

02:52.338 --> 02:53.337
Black cat.

02:53.389 --> 02:55.240
Black cat. Good choice.

02:58.861 --> 03:00.478
The cool thing about Halloween

03:00.529 --> 03:02.280
is that it's a uniquely
American holiday.

03:02.347 --> 03:03.782
I mean, despite
it's obvious origins

03:03.849 --> 03:07.035
in the Celtic Festival of Samhain
and the Christian All Saints Day,

03:07.119 --> 03:09.854
it really is a melting pot of various
immigrants' traditions and beliefs.

03:09.905 --> 03:12.223
It became a little more commercialized
in the 1950s with trick-or-treat,

03:12.291 --> 03:15.710
and today it rivals only Christmas
in terms of popularity.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.629
All I asked was what
he was doing this weekend.

03:17.696 --> 03:19.330
I'm toying
with the notion

03:19.398 --> 03:21.633
of either going to the Edgar
Allan Poe Shadow Puppet T

03:21.700 --> 03:24.202
or the reenactment of the
19th century Phantasmagoria.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.670
I don't want to know.

03:25.721 --> 03:27.005
Oh, yeah, you do.
Phantasmagorias

03:27.073 --> 03:30.341
are these amazing pre-cinema
projected ghost shows

03:30.409 --> 03:32.243
invented in France, where the showman
attempted to spook the audience

03:32.311 --> 03:35.413
using science magic.
And it just so happens

03:35.481 --> 03:36.915
that I have an extra ticket.

03:37.950 --> 03:38.883
Tempting.

03:38.934 --> 03:41.653
Guys, I wouldn't
have to worry

03:41.720 --> 03:44.055
about losing
my feminine curves

03:44.123 --> 03:46.057
if you all
paid more attention

03:46.108 --> 03:48.193
to all the trees
we're consuming around here.

03:48.260 --> 03:50.028
When did you become
an eco-freak?

03:50.079 --> 03:51.029
Baby, I was born green.

03:51.097 --> 03:52.397
We're going to Detroit.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.299
It's Halloween weekend.

03:54.366 --> 03:55.834
Arson investigators
have noticed a 3-year trend

03:55.901 --> 03:57.368
in the days leading up
to Halloween.

03:57.436 --> 03:58.703
Devil's Night.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.905
This unsub is killing only
these 3 days out of the year.

04:00.956 --> 04:02.273
How's he doing it?

04:02.341 --> 04:03.942
He's burning
his victims alive.

04:04.009 --> 04:05.743
He's abducting
seemingly random people

04:05.811 --> 04:07.595
and dumping their bodies
in abandoned parts of town.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.880
He struck again last night.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.215
Yeah. Tony Torrell, 40.

04:10.266 --> 04:12.617
He lives in the suburbs,
but he was found 20 miles away

04:12.685 --> 04:13.952
in the Rivertown District.

04:14.019 --> 04:16.821
He's attacking the city
at its most vulnerable time.

04:16.889 --> 04:18.589
What does he do during
the rest of the year?

04:18.656 --> 04:20.125
He's dormant.

04:20.192 --> 04:23.161
You know, arsonists are typically
white males between 17 and 25

04:23.229 --> 04:24.629
who can't stay away from fire.

04:24.697 --> 04:26.464
Yeah, they're addicted to
it and there's no rehab.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.566
And they target dwellings,
not people.

04:28.634 --> 04:31.603
So you're saying he burns his victims
alive but he's not an arsonist?

04:31.670 --> 04:33.271
Fire is simply his weapon.

04:33.322 --> 04:35.773
And Devil's Night gives him
the perfect cover to kill.

04:35.841 --> 04:39.077
Then we've got 48 hours
before he disappears again.

04:39.128 --> 04:41.479
Well, his last victim
was athletic.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.081
He wouldn't be easy to subdue.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.250
The offender must be
just as strong

04:45.317 --> 04:46.584
or might have an upper hand
if he's younger.

04:46.652 --> 04:50.588
Still, how does he transport
his victims across the city

04:50.639 --> 04:52.390
and get them inside buildings

04:52.458 --> 04:54.392
without being noticed?

05:28.677 --> 05:31.679

05:41.858 --> 05:43.275
Niccolo Machiavelli wrote,

05:43.326 --> 05:45.277
"if an injury
has to be done to a man,

05:45.345 --> 05:46.778
"it should be so severe

05:46.830 --> 05:49.448
that his vengeance
need not be feared."

05:49.516 --> 05:52.017
Now, I thought Devil's Night
was Halloween Eve.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.620
The moniker "Devil's Night"
is somewhat deceiving.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.388
In Detroit, it's actually
a 3-day citywide

05:56.456 --> 05:57.556
cultural phenomenon,

05:57.624 --> 06:00.225
complete with masks,
chaos, and costumes.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.060
Say that 3 times fast.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.662
Yeah, a violent one.
Sounds like Mardi Gras.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.265
Vandals and amateur arsonists
literally set hundreds of fires.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.933
Who burns their own city?

06:08.001 --> 06:09.935
It started as pranks
in the 1930s

06:10.003 --> 06:12.471
but escalated in the 1970s
with disenfranchised youth.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.706
Well, given today's economy,
it must be a free-for-all.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.976
They've got record-breaking
unemployment and foreclosures,

06:18.044 --> 06:19.912
leaving a lot of displaced,
desperate people.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.413
And every single one
of these victims

06:21.481 --> 06:23.315
suffered
unimaginable pain.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.351
I'm sure that's what gets
him off, watching them burn.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.719
It gives him
power and control.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.621
The top of the whodunit
list is first responders.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.089
Firefighters,
arson investigators,

06:31.157 --> 06:32.424
cops, and paramedics.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.426
Civil servants
with a hero complex.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.295
All of whom
will be helping us.

06:36.362 --> 06:37.362
This guy's angry.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.363
Aren't they all?

06:38.414 --> 06:40.165
Not like this.

06:40.216 --> 06:42.467
Have you seen these?

06:42.535 --> 06:45.237
Extreme anger usually
manifests from a quick temper,

06:45.305 --> 06:46.305
but this guy's patient.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.340
I'm gonna ask Garcia
to notify us

06:48.408 --> 06:50.275
the minute that someone's
reported missing.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.843
Burns 3 people annually.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.912
It's like his Christmas.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.381
And the rest of the year
he just plans--

06:56.449 --> 06:57.716
targeting his victims
and then choosing

06:57.784 --> 06:59.217
the buildings
he wants to kill them in.

06:59.269 --> 07:01.253
There's a flaw in his plan.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.522
We know about it.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.190
We're stretched
as it is,

07:05.258 --> 07:07.292
but we've set up
a joint task force

07:07.360 --> 07:08.894
with the Detroit P.D.
to catch this guy.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.061
It's pretty extensive.

07:10.113 --> 07:11.563
I'd say don't profile me,

07:11.614 --> 07:13.064
but you're in a roomful
of suspects, right?

07:13.116 --> 07:14.533
A city full.

07:14.584 --> 07:16.568
Victims abducted across
every socioeconomic divide.

07:16.636 --> 07:17.970
And this son of a bitch

07:18.037 --> 07:20.305
is about to burn
a few of them alive.

07:20.373 --> 07:21.573
Problem is, we've
gotta catch up.

07:21.641 --> 07:24.242
And we know
he's gonna be watching.

07:24.294 --> 07:26.912
Well, we're gonna
bust him this year.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.314
We've got two agents on the way
to last night's crime scene.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.916
Great.
I'll meet them there.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.417
I hope we find
something soon.

07:32.485 --> 07:34.419
It gets dark early
this time of year.

07:34.487 --> 07:35.938
And we'll head to the morgue.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.889
Hope you have
a strong stomach.

07:44.314 --> 07:45.764
Gasoline was the accelerant?

07:45.815 --> 07:47.816
Gas vapors collect
in a low, enclosed space.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.936
When he ignited, those vapors
burned down to his bone.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.938
We call this
a fourth-degree burn.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.940
There's a fracture
on the back of his skull.

07:55.008 --> 07:55.941
That's right.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.643
Was that postmortem?

07:57.710 --> 07:59.911
No, it was antemortem bruising.
He was struck from behind.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.279
Blitz attack.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.249
What's this on her face?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.785
Charred fabric.
All of the victims

08:06.853 --> 08:08.387
have the same material
on them.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.756
The fire fused the original
garment to his flesh,

08:10.807 --> 08:13.592
then burned away,
leaving behind these remains.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.760
He's covering their faces?

08:14.827 --> 08:16.061
That's my best guess, yes.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.430
He doesn't want his victims
looking at him,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.165
even though we wants
to watch them die.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.068
It could be a sign of guilt
or inadequacy.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.269
Now, wouldn't a guy
like this

08:24.337 --> 08:26.571
want to see the terror
in their eyes?

08:26.639 --> 08:28.440
Instead, he keeps them
in the dark.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.676
He's covering their faces
and setting them on fire.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.445
It's an execution.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.782
It's easy to see
why he sets fires down here.

08:36.832 --> 08:38.850
It's completely isolated.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.285
He can beat, torture, or burn
somebody and nobody would hear it.

08:41.337 --> 08:43.154
I never thought the FBI
would be here

08:43.206 --> 08:44.823
for our fine
city's tradition.

08:44.891 --> 08:46.324
I'm Al Garner with the DFD.

08:46.392 --> 08:48.093
Agents Morgan
and Prentiss.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.429
I guess Devil's Night
keeps you pretty busy, huh?

08:50.496 --> 08:52.330
Not as much
as it did in the eighties.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.700
Used to get up to 600, 700
fires back then.

08:54.767 --> 08:55.867
In 3 days?

08:55.935 --> 08:58.003
Down to 115 last year.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.388
It still takes
everything we got,

08:59.472 --> 09:02.024
but fortunately
we've had some help.

09:02.108 --> 09:04.860
Have the police increased their
patrols in the Rivertown District?

09:04.944 --> 09:07.896
I wish they could, but the
city's reeling from budget cuts.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.733
No. Detroit's finest
is a community group

09:11.818 --> 09:13.985
with over a thousand
volunteers.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.158
A thousand volunteers?

09:20.209 --> 09:22.210
Well, that just added
another thousand names

09:22.295 --> 09:24.379
to Garcia's list.

09:24.464 --> 09:25.564
Do you think
he's one of them?

09:25.631 --> 09:26.998
Can't rule anyone out.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.513
What is this place?

09:41.581 --> 09:44.900
It's an old engine
factory.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.018
It's massive.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.420
And medieval.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.921
From
the industrial age,

09:49.989 --> 09:52.224
when this city was pumping
out more cars and hit songs

09:52.291 --> 09:53.759
than anyplace else
in the world.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.495
This is where we found
Tony's charred remains.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.697
The char pattern
tracks back to here.

09:58.748 --> 10:01.817
That's where he stood
when he started the fire.

10:01.884 --> 10:04.035
Not the best vantage point.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.438
There's your
escape exit.

10:06.506 --> 10:09.040
Yeah, except
he didn't want that.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.075
He needs to watch the show.

10:11.127 --> 10:13.078
This is the moment he's
been waiting for all year.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.680
One where he doesn't feel
inadequate or rejected.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.432
So he watches
as long as he can.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.934
Yeah, but fire's unpredictable.

10:19.018 --> 10:22.086
Every second in here he's
putting his own life at risk.

10:22.138 --> 10:23.722
And this guy's
obviously confident

10:23.773 --> 10:25.624
that he can get out of
here before it's too late.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.958
But there was
a fire alarm.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.627
My men were here
in 5 minutes.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.612
How?
And he knew it.

10:30.696 --> 10:33.298
This unsub doesn't leave
anything to chance.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.500
He knows exactly how long
he's got with his victims.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.904
He probably knows response times
or at least listens to them.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.472
Police dispatcher:
All units, be advised

10:40.540 --> 10:43.492
of a robbery in progress
at 9760 East Mills.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.744
Radio DJ:
This is your man DJ Cutz
with an instant blast.

10:45.795 --> 10:48.630
The feds are in town cracking down
on this year's Devil's Night.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.149
So I'd advise everyone
to stay off of the streets

10:51.217 --> 10:54.118
and keep them radios locked
to FM 99 Detroit.

11:10.019 --> 11:13.188
The first time I looked at these
victims on the map, none of it made sense.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.841
7 different victims, various
ages, sex, and ethnicity.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.442
What do you see now?

11:17.510 --> 11:18.443
The first victim...

11:18.511 --> 11:19.945
Often tells us the most.

11:19.996 --> 11:21.029
Tommy Proctor.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.147
Well, his rap sheet
is longer than the Nile.

11:23.199 --> 11:26.318
It looks like he's always
walked on the dark side.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.520
The first kill inspired him.
What's different about it?

11:28.588 --> 11:30.956
Two things. First of all,
his body wasn't found for days.

11:31.057 --> 11:32.858
He was buried
deep in the building.

11:32.925 --> 11:34.526
That often tells us
that they know each other.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.495
Not to mention it took many
botched attempts to burn them.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.297
Because the unsub didn't
realize how difficult it is

11:39.365 --> 11:40.799
to actually burn
a human body.

11:40.850 --> 11:43.535
Or it's overkill.
He wanted Proctor to suffer the most.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.770
Which definitely
makes it personal.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.639
If he knew the first victim, it's
a good chance he knew them all.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.140
We just have to
find out how.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.943
We can start by talking
to Tony Torrell's wife.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.597
How you doing?

12:12.665 --> 12:15.600
Uh...I'm fine.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.086
Uh, I'm here to see
Agent Rossi.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.772
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
I'm Agent Prentiss.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.007
Oh, I'm Kiersten Torrell.

12:22.058 --> 12:25.543
Uh...My husband Tony
was killed last night.

12:25.611 --> 12:26.544
I know.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.380
And I'm very sorry.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.115
May I sit down?

12:30.182 --> 12:32.183
Oh, yeah.

12:36.989 --> 12:38.890
Are--are you working
on his case?

12:38.958 --> 12:41.059
Yes, I am.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.447
Is there a picture
of him in your folder?

12:45.531 --> 12:47.799
I want to see him.

12:51.287 --> 12:54.372
Kiersten, uh, your husband
was very badly burned.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.242
I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.378
What do you mean,
he was burnt?

13:01.480 --> 13:04.482
The person who did this
uses fire as a weapon.

13:04.550 --> 13:07.252
Was Tony set on fire alive?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.920
We don't know that--

13:08.971 --> 13:10.255
Oh, my God.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.658
Oh, my God,
this can't be happening.

13:15.695 --> 13:19.097
Ohh...Next week
was our anniversary.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.266
I'm so sorry.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.435
Are you married?

13:23.502 --> 13:26.738
No, I'm not,
and I can't imagine

13:26.789 --> 13:28.807
what you're going through.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.643
But everything you tell us

13:31.711 --> 13:34.746
can help us find the person
who did this to Tony.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.414
I know this is hard,

13:36.482 --> 13:38.450
but I want you to try
to remember that

13:38.517 --> 13:40.485
when you're talking
to Agent Rossi.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.520
Mm-hmm.

13:46.058 --> 13:50.996
Now, I'd like you to close
your eyes and relax.

13:51.063 --> 13:53.298
I want to walk you
through an exercise

13:53.366 --> 13:55.100
that's going to
help you recall

13:55.167 --> 13:56.968
everything that happened
last night.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.370
No, no, no.
What, like hypnosis?

13:58.437 --> 14:00.238
Not at all.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.507
Now, just close
your eyes

14:02.575 --> 14:06.544
and do the best
that you can. Ok?

14:06.612 --> 14:08.213
All right.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.881
Think about last night.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.584
You and Tony, you went to the
Halloween FItestival in Greektown.

14:12.651 --> 14:14.586
What time was it?

14:14.653 --> 14:16.254
Uh, around 9:30.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.089
Crowded?

14:23.095 --> 14:24.529
Yeah.

14:24.597 --> 14:28.767
Uh, there were drums
and loud music,

14:28.834 --> 14:31.603
some people wore costumes.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.938
Tony and I went
to the festival every year.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.107
We actually met there
when we were in high school.

14:36.175 --> 14:39.644
But this year we decided
not to dress up.

14:47.403 --> 14:48.903
Ohh!

14:50.022 --> 14:51.189
What is it?

14:51.257 --> 14:55.193
A kid dressed in a mask
jumped out, scared me.

14:55.244 --> 14:57.361
It made Tony laugh.

14:57.413 --> 14:58.830
Where's his mama?

14:58.898 --> 14:59.898
What type of mask?

14:59.965 --> 15:02.033
Uh, round, like a baby.

15:02.101 --> 15:06.037
Ok. What do you see next?

15:09.308 --> 15:11.509
Fire.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.895
They were grilling lamb,

15:13.979 --> 15:15.847
and, uh, people were cheering.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.016
All right. It was
a Greek restaurant.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.734
Baby, me and gyros?

15:19.819 --> 15:20.735
No, thanks.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.253
What?

15:22.321 --> 15:23.271
I'm gonna go check out
this Mexican food.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.589
Oh, baby, no.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.091
Baby, I'm be right back.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.909
All right.
I'll come and get you.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.594
All right.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.530
Now, do you remember
anyone in the crowd,

15:32.598 --> 15:35.567
anyone
that didn't fit in?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.104
No.

15:39.171 --> 15:42.373
But to be honest, I was
already looking at the menu.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.909
All right, that's good.
Now, don't look up from the menu.

15:44.977 --> 15:47.278
Just listen to me.

15:47.346 --> 15:50.248
When you love someone
and they step away,

15:50.316 --> 15:54.252
there's an instinctive
response to glance up

15:54.320 --> 15:56.054
to make sure that
they're still there.

15:56.105 --> 15:59.891
Now, you did that last night
even if you don't remember.

15:59.959 --> 16:04.395
Ok. You're getting ready
to place an order.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.098
I already know what I'm getting.
I'm getting the gyro.

16:07.149 --> 16:08.950
Kiersten, where's Tony?

16:10.002 --> 16:12.570
He's at the Mexican restaurant.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.005
Is someone around him?

16:15.007 --> 16:16.741
Yes.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.977
Uh, but I can't really
make out his face.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.796
What about his body?
Is it young? Is it old?

16:21.881 --> 16:24.749
Uh...25 maybe.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.017
Wait.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.920
He's wearing a mask.

16:28.988 --> 16:29.921
Like the kid?

16:29.972 --> 16:31.256
No, no, no, no, no.

16:31.307 --> 16:34.425
It only covers
one side of his face.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.594
His ear is gone.

16:36.645 --> 16:39.197
And, um...

16:39.231 --> 16:41.866
What do you see?

16:41.934 --> 16:43.801
It's a black guy.

16:43.853 --> 16:46.070
He's black.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.992
You make him sound like he's
Freddy Krueger or something.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.111
No, but I do think
he's severely burned.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.163
It explains why he chooses
this time of the year.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.347
He doesn't have to hide
his scars.

16:56.415 --> 16:57.549
What about his victims?

16:57.616 --> 16:59.551
He's punishing them
for wronging him.

16:59.618 --> 17:02.320
Wronging him?
What about his second victim?

17:02.371 --> 17:05.205
Have you looked at
Josephine Davis' life?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.392
She was the nicest
woman in the world.

17:07.459 --> 17:08.843
How did she wrong this guy?

17:08.928 --> 17:10.528
He's had interactions
with all of his victims,

17:10.596 --> 17:12.797
some more personal
than others.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.566
So he's acting
out of revenge.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.233
Kiersten and Tony didn't
even speak to him.

17:16.301 --> 17:17.801
Maybe not that night,

17:17.869 --> 17:19.404
but at some point
in the past.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.838
Now, wait a minute.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.906
Josephine was abducted
from her husband.

17:22.974 --> 17:24.642
Tony was abducted
from his wife.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.512
You think these couples represent
the happiness he covets?

17:28.614 --> 17:29.898
Or something he lost.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.316
He's a young guy
with a deformity.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.151
Major insecurities
come with that.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.020
A trauma like that
would be devastating for him

17:36.088 --> 17:38.089
and anyone in his life.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.605

18:37.650 --> 18:38.783
Daddy?

18:38.851 --> 18:40.285
Daddy!

18:40.352 --> 18:43.254
Please, please, daddy!

18:43.305 --> 18:46.257
Daddy!

18:46.325 --> 18:47.925
Daddy!

18:47.977 --> 18:49.093
Daddy!

18:49.161 --> 18:50.895
Daddy, please!

19:05.929 --> 19:08.617
Do you know how rare it is for
an arsonist to be a burn victim?

19:08.701 --> 19:09.835
Less than 3.5%.

19:09.902 --> 19:11.837
This guy's not an arsonist.

19:11.904 --> 19:13.605
He's a serial killer
who uses fire.

19:13.673 --> 19:15.273
And that choice of weapon
tells us that he's aggressive,

19:15.341 --> 19:17.576
driven, and destructive,
just like fire itself.

19:17.643 --> 19:19.778
But why would someone
so controlling

19:19.846 --> 19:21.496
choose the most
unpredictable weapon?

19:21.581 --> 19:23.148
This juxtaposition tells us

19:23.216 --> 19:25.750
there's more going on
with him than we realize.

19:25.818 --> 19:28.153
He's probably experienced
some kind of loss

19:28.221 --> 19:31.389
these past few years that
started him down this path.

19:34.994 --> 19:37.462
We should look at accidents
where couples were burned.

19:37.530 --> 19:39.431
We're talking about
hundreds of fires.

19:39.498 --> 19:41.666
Focusing on ones where
gasoline was the accelerant.

19:42.885 --> 19:45.170
Leaving his victims
in the heart of Rivertown,

19:45.238 --> 19:47.472
in the center
of these buildings themselves,

19:47.523 --> 19:49.541
may be subconscious
on his part,

19:49.609 --> 19:51.943
but it says that this
affected his very core.

19:52.011 --> 19:54.546
All right, hold on.
Somebody else has just been abducted.

19:54.614 --> 19:56.615
How do we know
this is our guy?

19:56.682 --> 19:58.783
Because his daughter said a
monster took her daddy away.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.692
Kaman!

20:07.760 --> 20:10.028
Kaman, come on, man.

20:10.079 --> 20:11.630
What are you doing?
My little girl's back there.

20:11.697 --> 20:13.198
You gotta let me go.

20:13.266 --> 20:14.633
The victim's name
is Christopher Edwards.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.301
He's 35.
He lives in the suburbs.

20:16.369 --> 20:17.903
- Birmingham.
- What part?

20:17.970 --> 20:19.671
How far is that from
the Rivertown District?

20:19.722 --> 20:21.039
Not more than 40 minutes.

20:21.107 --> 20:22.440
He might already be inside.

20:22.508 --> 20:24.075
Let's lock it down.
We'll trap him.

20:24.176 --> 20:25.644
I'll go with you.
I'm going down there.

20:25.711 --> 20:28.346
Garcia, have Detroit
P.D. set up roadblocks.

20:28.414 --> 20:29.614
Got it.

20:34.553 --> 20:37.856
Chris Edwards is a husband,
he's a father,

20:37.924 --> 20:39.958
he's a general contractor.

20:40.026 --> 20:41.826
I would check any
subcontractors who've worked with him.

20:41.894 --> 20:44.496
Ok, that is a humungous list.
What do you want me to do with it?

20:44.563 --> 20:48.833
Anything that requires flames--plumbers,
electricians, welders.

20:48.901 --> 20:51.369
Did he fire a welder
recently?

20:51.437 --> 20:53.905
Ok. Uh, he's been using

20:53.956 --> 20:55.240
Vinnie's Welding and Fence,

20:55.308 --> 20:57.609
but he hasn't hired them
back in months.

20:57.677 --> 20:59.444
List of employees coming up.

20:59.512 --> 21:01.279
It's still a lofty handful.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.381
Ok, we think he's been
following the investigation.

21:03.449 --> 21:05.951
Look at volunteers
with Detroit's finest.

21:06.018 --> 21:08.103
Ok, I'm crossing employees
with volunteers.

21:08.170 --> 21:09.354
Nothing.

21:09.455 --> 21:11.189
Come on, baby girl,
keep checking.

21:11.257 --> 21:12.958
There's gotta be
a connection here.

21:13.025 --> 21:14.960
Ok, I'm gonna long-shot it
and I'm gonna cross

21:15.027 --> 21:17.929
the Michigan Business Directory
with the payroll company

21:17.980 --> 21:20.765
and see if I still got
what it takes to find stuff.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.267
And I do.
His name's Kaman Scott.

21:22.335 --> 21:24.936
I'm working on that.
You got an address?

21:28.291 --> 21:29.374
Kaman.

21:29.441 --> 21:30.825
Kaman, come on, man.

21:34.914 --> 21:37.682
Kaman, you gotta let me go.
Please, let me go.

21:38.851 --> 21:40.585
What do you want?

21:40.653 --> 21:42.170
I'll give you anything you want.
You want money?

21:42.254 --> 21:43.455
You want a job?

21:43.522 --> 21:48.643
Just don't do anything
stupid, man, all right?

21:48.728 --> 21:51.496
Damn it, come on, man!

21:56.369 --> 21:58.470
Ok, from the look
of Kaman Scott's early years,

21:58.537 --> 22:01.606
he was on a fast track to be some kind
of hoodlum bad boy super convict,

22:01.674 --> 22:05.443
but something happened in 2004 that
made him change his evil tune,

22:05.511 --> 22:07.679
'cause then there's no arrests,
there's no suspicions,

22:07.747 --> 22:09.447
there's no sign of rehab,
but he totally cleaned up.

22:09.515 --> 22:10.949
Maybe that's when
he met someone.

22:11.017 --> 22:14.219
Has he ever been arrested
with a man named Tommy Proctor?

22:14.286 --> 22:17.122
Yeah, once, uh, 2002...

22:17.173 --> 22:19.224
Yikes, and then they collided
again in 2005,

22:19.291 --> 22:22.827
like literally collided.
Kaman was in an accident and his car blew up.

22:22.895 --> 22:24.496
Well, there's
your gas accelerant.

22:24.563 --> 22:26.164
He was hit
by that guy, Tommy Proctor.

22:26.232 --> 22:28.499
There's your revenge.

22:28.551 --> 22:31.369
Twist of fate. The life he left
behind came back to haunt him.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.405
So Tommy walks away
without a scratch

22:33.472 --> 22:35.740
and Kaman suffers a ton
of third-degree burns,

22:35.808 --> 22:38.526
had a boatload of skin grafts, was
in a coma for a couple of months,

22:38.611 --> 22:39.844
lost his apartment.

22:39.912 --> 22:41.146
Oh, and then
there's that guy--

22:41.213 --> 22:42.647
his landlord
was Tony Torrell.

22:42.715 --> 22:44.582
So we were right.
He does have a revenge list.

22:44.650 --> 22:47.585
What about family,
friends, acquaintances?

22:47.653 --> 22:48.787
No, that Kaman
is a lone wolf.

22:48.854 --> 22:50.739
And his address
just came up.

22:50.823 --> 22:53.425
Big bad lives at 5923 Mills.

23:21.187 --> 23:23.254
Clear here.

23:23.322 --> 23:24.823
Clear.

23:26.125 --> 23:28.276
It's like a cave.

23:30.196 --> 23:32.580
This guy hides out
all year long.

23:32.665 --> 23:37.135
With burns like that, he's
probably sensitive to light.

23:37.203 --> 23:38.770
And his own skin.

23:38.838 --> 23:41.306
When you look around, there's
not a mirror in sight.

23:41.373 --> 23:43.574
This guy doesn't want any
reminder of what he looks like.

23:43.626 --> 23:46.461
There's nothing
personal in here.

23:46.545 --> 23:48.930
Well, we said he'd have
nothing to live for.

23:49.014 --> 23:52.750
For a planner like Kaman, tonight's
abduction was irrational.

23:52.818 --> 23:55.653
He went on private property
and took Chris Edwards

23:55.721 --> 23:57.605
with a witness present.

23:57.690 --> 24:00.592
Maybe he's finally starting to feel
the pressure and he's reactive.

24:00.659 --> 24:02.694
More than that,
he's meticulous.

24:02.761 --> 24:04.462
He'd have a plan
if he got cornered.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.264
He'd have an endgame.

24:06.332 --> 24:09.600
Well, he already killed the man
he blames for his accident.

24:09.652 --> 24:12.570
The other victims are slights
compared to that.

24:12.621 --> 24:15.273
And now he needs to hurt the
person that hurt him the most.

24:15.341 --> 24:17.609
The one who drives
all of this.

24:17.676 --> 24:19.677
The one
who broke his heart.

24:19.745 --> 24:22.514
Yeah, but who the hell
is that?

24:29.421 --> 24:31.856
I swear I won't tell
anybody about this.

24:33.826 --> 24:35.960
Aah! Aah! Son of a bitch!

24:36.011 --> 24:38.630
Oh, God!

24:38.697 --> 24:41.132
I'm sorry, man.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.433
I'm so sorry.

24:42.501 --> 24:44.502
It wasn't my call.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.404
No! What are you doing?!

24:46.472 --> 24:48.973
What are you doing?!

24:50.676 --> 24:53.311
No, Kaman, please, no!

24:53.379 --> 24:56.581
Oh, God! Let me go!

24:56.649 --> 24:58.482
Aah!

25:25.925 --> 25:27.476
Kaman Scott
worked for Chris Edwards.

25:27.550 --> 25:29.051
He was fired 7 months ago.

25:29.119 --> 25:30.319
Why did he
kill him here?

25:30.386 --> 25:32.121
Roadblocks forced him
out of his comfort zone.

25:32.189 --> 25:34.356
Anything in the van?

25:34.424 --> 25:36.025
Welding equipment,
cans of gasoline.

25:36.093 --> 25:38.427
And a cage.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.130
I'm getting everyone in
the city down here on this.

25:41.198 --> 25:44.867
Without his car, he's going to lie
in wait until he can't anymore.

25:47.871 --> 25:50.306
Then he's gonna
lash out again.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.323
Prentiss.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.259
I think I found something.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.927
What do you got?

26:44.995 --> 26:47.096
A girl.

26:47.164 --> 26:49.265
There's two more
of the same girl in here.

26:49.332 --> 26:51.466
Oh, jeez, we gotta find out
who she is.

26:51.518 --> 26:54.636
If this guy's feeling
cornered, all bets are off.

26:54.688 --> 26:57.973
Tonight's his last chance to get revenge
on anyone who's ever wronged him.

26:58.041 --> 27:00.609
She's most likely
his next target.

27:03.446 --> 27:06.015
Garcia, we're gonna send you
some photographs.

27:06.082 --> 27:07.783
What do you want me
to do with them?

27:07.851 --> 27:09.718
Blow up the background,
see if you can find anything

27:09.786 --> 27:11.654
that tells us
who this girl is.

27:11.721 --> 27:12.922
I'll hit you back.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.371
Uh-uh! We're closed!

27:29.439 --> 27:31.440
No, you not.

27:36.213 --> 27:37.580
Not to me.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.620
Boy, what's wrong with you?
Get out.

27:44.688 --> 27:46.288
Not tonight.

27:52.362 --> 27:54.296
Where is she?

27:55.332 --> 27:56.866
Where is Tracy?

27:58.668 --> 28:00.336
Kaman, I said...

28:00.387 --> 28:01.770
Get out.

28:01.838 --> 28:03.205
I can't.

28:03.273 --> 28:05.875
I can't do that tonight.
They comin' after me.

28:05.942 --> 28:09.011
What have you done?

28:09.079 --> 28:10.980
I just need to see her.

28:11.047 --> 28:13.115
I told you,
don't come back in here.

28:13.183 --> 28:14.149
It's over.

28:14.217 --> 28:15.818
Son...

28:15.886 --> 28:18.737
You need to get
some help.

28:20.607 --> 28:22.191
Don't you do it, old man!

28:22.242 --> 28:24.777
Aah!

28:24.861 --> 28:26.779
Aah! Aah!

28:26.863 --> 28:28.280
Aah! Aah! Aah!

28:31.001 --> 28:32.868
Where is she?!

28:32.936 --> 28:35.504
You go to hell!

28:36.873 --> 28:38.774
You gonna burn.

28:39.876 --> 28:40.793
Garcia.

28:40.877 --> 28:41.810
Friends, we're on 3-way.

28:41.878 --> 28:43.379
What's going on?
Hotch, we found

28:43.446 --> 28:45.614
some pictures of Kaman's
girlfriend at his apartment.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.616
So I blew up those pictures.
In one of them

28:47.684 --> 28:49.318
she appears to be
in a restaurant,

28:49.386 --> 28:51.420
so I zoomed in on the sign
that says "o" apostrophe "s,"

28:51.488 --> 28:53.222
cross-checked that
with restaurants in the area,

28:53.290 --> 28:55.257
and there are 5 diners.

28:55.308 --> 28:56.759
3 are in the suburbs,

28:56.826 --> 28:59.028
2 are in Highland Park,
and one is in Rivertown.

28:59.095 --> 29:00.262
Jay-mo's.
What's the name?

29:00.330 --> 29:03.132
And this appears to be
Kaman's and that girl's

29:03.199 --> 29:04.600
favorite place 'cause all
the pictures were taken there.

29:04.668 --> 29:05.601
Have you heard of Jay-Mo's?

29:05.669 --> 29:07.169
It's a few blocks from here.

29:07.237 --> 29:09.305
Good work, Garcia.
We're on the way.

29:14.077 --> 29:16.245
You're sick, Kaman.

29:16.313 --> 29:18.464
We done talkin'.

29:18.548 --> 29:20.382
This ain't the way.

29:20.450 --> 29:21.884
You tell me where she is.

29:23.687 --> 29:26.388
She ain't with you,
I know where she is.

29:26.456 --> 29:30.092
Don't do it.
Leave Tracy alone.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.143
Kaman.

29:35.015 --> 29:36.398
It's too late for her.

29:39.703 --> 29:41.737
And it's too late for you.

29:47.310 --> 29:48.644
Kaman!

29:50.380 --> 29:52.831
Hotch, a fire alert
just went out,

29:52.916 --> 29:55.484
it's at Jay-Mo's diner.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.010
Backup's on the way.

30:21.077 --> 30:22.177
There isn't time.

30:22.245 --> 30:24.013
All units, 565 East Jefferson.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.616
I repeat, all units,
565 East Jefferson.

30:34.424 --> 30:38.360
This is Lieutenant Al Garner, requesting
available Fire and EMS Units.

30:38.428 --> 30:40.662
We got a man inside.
Requesting additional alarms.

30:40.730 --> 30:44.433
Repeat, all units,
565 East Jefferson.

30:58.797 --> 30:59.730
BP's 84 over 36.

31:00.416 --> 31:01.749
The owner's car was stolen.

31:01.801 --> 31:03.084
I need to ask him
some questions.

31:03.135 --> 31:04.636
He's in and out
of consciousness.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.888
I'm with the FBI.
Can you give me a thumbs-up

31:06.955 --> 31:10.091
for yes
and a thumbs-down for no?

31:10.159 --> 31:11.476
Did Kaman Scott
do this to you?

31:11.560 --> 31:13.928
We have 15 minutes to
get him to the hospital.

31:13.979 --> 31:15.463
Do you know this girl?

31:15.564 --> 31:17.899
Tracy. Tracy.

31:17.966 --> 31:19.334
Don't let him.

31:19.401 --> 31:20.401
Please stop him.

31:20.469 --> 31:21.903
Is Tracy nearby?

31:21.971 --> 31:25.306
Go, go. Yes.
Yes. Get him.

31:25.357 --> 31:27.826
Ok, let's move.
Resuscitator.

31:27.910 --> 31:29.160
Hotch, you ran into
a burning building?

31:29.245 --> 31:30.445
I didn't have a choice.

31:30.496 --> 31:32.447
Her name's Tracy.
Kaman's trying to find her.

31:32.498 --> 31:34.582
That man put his life on
the line to protect her.

31:34.650 --> 31:36.084
So she means
something to him.

31:36.152 --> 31:37.485
She means everything.

32:02.912 --> 32:05.113
Ooh. Hey.

32:05.181 --> 32:07.615
Got to finish
the dishes.

32:08.851 --> 32:11.119
All right, well,
hurry up.

32:14.406 --> 32:15.924
Jay-Mo's real name
is James Morris.

32:15.991 --> 32:17.725
He was married
to Loretta Butler.

32:17.793 --> 32:18.860
Does he have
any children?

32:18.928 --> 32:20.044
Yes, they has one daughter.

32:20.129 --> 32:22.397
Her name is Tracy Anderson.
She was born in 1987.

32:22.464 --> 32:24.332
Why does she have
a different last name?

32:24.400 --> 32:28.169
When James' wife died, his sister
Susan Anderson adopted Tracy.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.054
And where is she now?

32:30.139 --> 32:31.239
She currently lives in Ohio.

32:31.307 --> 32:32.307
No, he says she's nearby.

32:32.374 --> 32:33.808
Where do the Andersons live?

32:33.876 --> 32:35.643
Uh, Indian Village.

32:35.711 --> 32:36.844
That's 3 miles away.

32:36.912 --> 32:38.580
Let's go.

32:38.647 --> 32:41.549
Here you go, hon.
I found a few more glasses for you.

32:45.921 --> 32:47.355
Tom.

32:47.423 --> 32:50.158
Oh, my God, Tom!

32:54.396 --> 32:56.798
Where is Tracy?

32:59.118 --> 33:02.337
Sorry. I keep trying the Anderson
house, but the line's busy.

33:02.404 --> 33:04.172
He must
already be there.

33:04.239 --> 33:05.673
Garcia, have any fires
been reported in the area?

33:05.741 --> 33:07.675
Negative, but medics and fire
suppression are on the way.

33:07.743 --> 33:09.611
Good.
Tell them to stand by.

33:09.678 --> 33:11.512
Roger that. Sir, there's
one more thing I gotta tell you.

33:11.580 --> 33:12.947
What is it?

33:48.917 --> 33:52.136
Now let's just get honest
with each other.

33:52.221 --> 33:53.721
Where's Tracy?

33:54.923 --> 33:55.857
She's not here.

33:55.924 --> 33:57.025
You're lying.

33:58.093 --> 33:59.794
I know she's back.

33:59.862 --> 34:03.698
Tracy's going to medical
school in Ohio.

34:03.766 --> 34:07.035
I don't believe a damn word
come out your mouth.

34:07.102 --> 34:08.969
We have no reason to lie.

34:09.038 --> 34:10.705
It's been 5 years, Kaman.

34:10.773 --> 34:12.607
She's moved on
with her life.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.509
Why can't you just accept that?

34:14.576 --> 34:15.743
Shut up!

34:36.197 --> 34:38.533
I'm calling backup.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.668
If anybody moves,
we're in trouble.

34:41.737 --> 34:43.638
We need a shooter.

34:43.706 --> 34:44.972
We're here.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.076
Your man wants everyone
to hold their position.

34:48.143 --> 34:50.043
We need a single rifle.

34:50.112 --> 34:54.181
I say again, all units,
hold your position.

34:54.233 --> 34:56.067
Copy that.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.404
This is the street.

34:59.488 --> 35:02.824
Hotch is going inside.

35:02.891 --> 35:04.542
And he's on his own.

35:04.626 --> 35:07.528
Hotch won't do
anything to spin him.

35:07.596 --> 35:09.197
It's not Kaman
I'm worried about.

35:09.264 --> 35:11.199
This isn't his first time
at the dance.

35:11.266 --> 35:12.834
We gotta trust him on this.

35:26.849 --> 35:30.618
Kaman,
why are you doing this?

35:30.686 --> 35:32.920
We never did anything
to you.

35:32.988 --> 35:34.021
You kept Tracy
away from me.

35:34.089 --> 35:36.624
Look what you've done.

35:36.692 --> 35:39.761
What you're about to do now.

35:39.828 --> 35:42.463
I wasn't always like this.

35:43.699 --> 35:47.435
People don't change, Kaman.

35:47.503 --> 35:49.537
This is all your fault.

35:49.605 --> 35:52.507
Baby, you can't keep blaming the
world for what happened to you.

35:57.846 --> 35:59.680
Baby, look at me.
Look at me.

35:59.748 --> 36:01.983
Kaman.

36:05.587 --> 36:08.523
What...

36:08.590 --> 36:11.025
What is going on?

36:12.394 --> 36:14.395
I needed to see you.

36:14.463 --> 36:17.198
And this is how
you do it?

36:21.170 --> 36:23.471
You abandoned me.

36:23.539 --> 36:25.907
You walked away from me
when I needed you the most.

36:25.974 --> 36:28.743
That's not good enough!
I'm sorry.

36:29.878 --> 36:31.379
After the accident,

36:31.446 --> 36:33.464
I had to get my life together.

36:33.549 --> 36:35.583
And what about my damn life?

36:35.634 --> 36:39.153
It took me 2 years
to get back on my feet.

36:39.221 --> 36:42.924
You were the only thing
that kept me going.

36:42.991 --> 36:45.993
Kaman...

36:46.061 --> 36:48.629
What happened to you?

36:48.697 --> 36:52.033
What do you think
happened to me?

36:52.100 --> 36:53.818
Mommy?

36:55.904 --> 36:57.505
Who else is here?

36:59.875 --> 37:02.176
Mommy, what's wrong?

37:07.499 --> 37:09.834
That's my sister's son.

37:09.918 --> 37:12.486
Uh, go back upstairs, baby.
Go back upstairs.

37:12.538 --> 37:13.654
Wait, wait, wait.

37:13.722 --> 37:14.989
He said mama.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.692
The boy's confused, Kaman.

37:19.928 --> 37:21.696
Is that your son?

37:21.763 --> 37:23.831
No, Kaman.

37:23.899 --> 37:26.868
Don't you stand in front of me
and lie to my face.

37:26.935 --> 37:28.469
Kaman, drop it.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.942
You shoot me, I drop this
and they burn. Then what?

37:35.010 --> 37:37.545
You move, you die.

37:37.613 --> 37:40.047
I'm already dead.
I ain't got nothin' else to live for.

37:40.115 --> 37:42.149
Tracy, you need
to tell him.

37:42.217 --> 37:43.818
Tell me what?

37:43.886 --> 37:46.521
What the hell's
going on here?

37:46.588 --> 37:48.489
He needs to know.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.558
Kaman...

37:50.626 --> 37:52.159
While you were in a coma,

37:52.227 --> 37:54.395
I found out I was pregnant.

37:54.463 --> 37:56.931
No...

37:59.902 --> 38:01.402
I didn't know
what to do.

38:01.470 --> 38:02.837
I thought
you were gonna die.

38:02.905 --> 38:04.272
Baby, I'm so sorry.

38:06.308 --> 38:09.010
You're telling me...

38:09.077 --> 38:10.745
That's my son?

38:13.415 --> 38:16.350
Kaman, you don't want to
do this in front of your son.

38:16.418 --> 38:19.153
Put it down.

38:19.221 --> 38:22.456
Baby, if you don't
do it for me, do it for him.

38:26.128 --> 38:28.996
Don't you want
to know his name?

38:48.650 --> 38:51.118
What's your name?

38:51.219 --> 38:54.956
Daniel Kaman Anderson.

39:28.924 --> 39:31.525
Thomas Kemp wrote,

39:31.593 --> 39:33.027

39:50.312 --> 39:51.846
Dad, don't look at me.

39:51.913 --> 39:53.681
I'm not looking.
Are you almost ready?

39:53.749 --> 39:54.682
Yes.

39:54.750 --> 39:55.883
Do you need any help?

39:55.951 --> 39:56.884
No.

39:56.952 --> 39:57.952
Ok.

40:00.122 --> 40:03.557
Whoa. That is definitely
not Spider-man.

40:03.625 --> 40:06.627
He's not a real superhero.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.763
He's not?

40:08.830 --> 40:10.297
Ok, I give up.

40:10.365 --> 40:11.565
Who are you
supposed to be?

40:11.633 --> 40:14.068
I'm you, daddy.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.310
Come here, buddy.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.897
Ok.

40:26.982 --> 40:29.417
Let's go get some candy,
my little G-man.
