01:19.600 --> 01:22.480
What about if we went to
a proper salon?

01:23.560 --> 01:28.760
Salon? Yes. It's a place you can go
for someone to cut your hair.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.240
Properly!

Not a bad likeness.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.160
Finished yours, Sarah?

02:04.160 --> 02:06.680
Not even started.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.880
So, how about that haircut, eh?

03:34.520 --> 03:36.800
SHE GASPS
Can I get a wig instead?

03:36.800 --> 03:40.720
Wouldn't you prefer your
hair to be shorter?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.760
Oh, yeah.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.640
Fancy one of those?

03:49.840 --> 03:52.280
Er... No.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.720
Perhaps not.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.680
There, all done!

03:55.680 --> 03:57.720

So, what can we do for Madame today?

04:28.240 --> 04:29.680
MUFFLED: Nothing.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.120
MUFFLED: I'm scared.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.480
Maybe just a trim?

04:35.720 --> 04:37.640
Perfect.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.320
Better if I put your hat up here.
Ah!
