You know, it was really unclear.

I have to admit, Prince Zuko,
I really find you attractive.

find out about this?

That's right, she did.

on my bad side?

and I'm still waiting.

I hate this play.

I know it's upsetting, but it
sounds like you're overreacting.

you can get me backstage?

to give to the actor me.

for many years in the art of stealth.

get you backstage.

Geez, everyone's getting
so upset about their characters.

and that's saying something.

You don't get it.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.240
It's different for you.

16:30.530 --> 16:33.790
You get a muscly version of yourself
taking down 10 bad guys at once

16:34.040 --> 16:35.500
and making sassy remarks.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.750
Yeah, that's pretty great.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.040
But for me, it takes
all the mistakes I've made in my life

16:41.170 --> 16:42.790
and shoves them back in my face.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.420
My uncle, he's always been on my side,
even when things were bad.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.010
He was there for me.

16:49.430 --> 16:52.300
He taught me so much,
and how do I repay him?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.100
With a knife in his back.

16:54.810 --> 16:58.390
It's my greatest regret, and I
may never get to redeem myself.

You have redeemed yourself
to your uncle.

but you already have.

17:04.480 --> 17:05.530
How do you know?

17:05.650 --> 17:08.280
Because I once had a long conversation
with the guy

17:08.450 --> 17:10.360
And all he would talk about
was you.

17:11.070 --> 17:12.070
Really?

17:12.160 --> 17:14.080
Yeah, and it was
kind of annoying.

17:14.540 --> 17:15.740
Oh, sorry.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.540
But it was also very sweet.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.670

your own path and see the light.

what you said in there?

18:41.290 --> 18:42.750
What are you talking about?

On stage, when you said I was
just like a brother to you

18:47.250 --> 18:48.920
and you didn't have
feelings for me.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.340
I didn't say that.

we were gonna be together, but we're not.

to worry about.

better, and Katara was the painted lady
