- Yeah, it's a terrible idea.
Sorry.

41:58.603 --> 42:00.605
Anyway, we don't have
to decide right now.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.432
Come on.

42:02.476 --> 42:03.738
- Where are we going?

42:03.782 --> 42:05.958
- I vote Tarantino's.

42:06.001 --> 42:09.962
Spaghetti bolognese.
Caesar salad. Veal piccata.

42:10.005 --> 42:11.790
Should we take the bottle?

42:11.833 --> 42:14.009
- It would be irresponsible
not to.

42:14.053 --> 42:15.489
- Let's go.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.624
You are messy, you know that,
right?
