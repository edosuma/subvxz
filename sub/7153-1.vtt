Get out of the way! Move!

01:00.860 --> 01:01.918
Come on.

01:03.295 --> 01:05.489
Come on, man.
Get up.

01:05.598 --> 01:06.860
Come on.

01:08.801 --> 01:09.927
Shoot!

01:15.307 --> 01:17.741
<i>Suspect out of the way.
Heading toward Exchange.</i>

01:19.945 --> 01:21.572
Move it!
Out of the way!

01:27.686 --> 01:29.586
Hold it!

01:37.997 --> 01:41.455
Don't move! Don't move!
Get away from that window!

01:41.567 --> 01:43.694
Get over there!
Do what I say!

01:44.737 --> 01:46.932
Oh, shit. Pick up my meat.

01:50.776 --> 01:54.837
- You hungry, brother?
- Do I look hungry? Get over there!

01:57.650 --> 02:01.051
I might be a little hungry,
but get your hands up!

02:01.153 --> 02:03.883
- He ain't got no gun.
- You think I ain't got a gun?

02:03.989 --> 02:07.152
- Shoot me, goddamn it!
- I'll shoot you.

02:09.261 --> 02:10.990
You mother...

02:11.096 --> 02:12.757
No. Come on, Hank!

02:12.865 --> 02:14.856
Back up, back up!

02:14.967 --> 02:16.457
What you know about
a brother needing a job?

02:18.187 --> 02:20.382
- Big Floyd Patterson haircut head.
- You don't look like Floyd.

02:20.489 --> 02:22.821
Shoot. I just wanted
to barbecue.

02:22.925 --> 02:25.359
It's the goddamn Fourth of July.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.724
Can't a black man have
a goddamn Fourth of July, too?

02:29.831 --> 02:31.731
- Open up! It's the police!
- Sweet Jesus.

02:33.468 --> 02:34.935
Kick it in!

02:35.837 --> 02:39.068
- Don't mess with my conk.
- You want a barbecue?

02:42.210 --> 02:44.872
Is there a problem, officers?

02:44.980 --> 02:48.541
Yeah. We're looking for a thief.
You seen one?

02:49.418 --> 02:51.682
Me? No, I haven't seen a thi...

02:51.787 --> 02:53.880
Hank, you seen
a thief around here?

02:53.989 --> 02:57.049
- No, no, not around here.
- No, me, either.

02:57.159 --> 02:58.285
No thief.

03:02.164 --> 03:04.428
You guys aren't
celebrating the holiday?

03:04.533 --> 03:07.297
Sure. We're just finishing up
our last customer.

03:15.410 --> 03:17.810
I said play
like you cuttin' it.

05:52.167 --> 05:54.135
Eddie, you can't talk about people
just 'cause they biracial.

05:55.552 --> 05:57.144
- Why not?
- 'Cause that's silly.

05:57.254 --> 05:59.188
They can take it
like anybody else.

05:59.289 --> 06:02.816
All I'm saying, Calvin,
is black folk love to take credit

06:02.926 --> 06:06.089
for they half-black brothers
and sisters till somethin' goes sour.

06:06.196 --> 06:09.563
You know, like Tiger Woods...
we claim him.

06:09.666 --> 06:12.294
<i>Jennifer Beals. What the boy mama
used to be on The Jeffersons?</i>

06:12.402 --> 06:15.371
- Lenny Kravitz.
- Lenny Kravitz... count him.

06:15.472 --> 06:18.373
As soon as they go freak out
just a little bit,

06:18.475 --> 06:21.410
go a little crazy, get a little glitter
like Mariah Carey,

06:21.512 --> 06:26.347
then all of a sudden it's the other half
that went looney tunes.

06:26.450 --> 06:31.046
- What about Vin Diesel?
- I don't know what he is. Half car.

06:31.154 --> 06:32.985
What black man
do you take credit for?

06:33.090 --> 06:37.527
<i>I'll tell you who I don't want
to take credit for... that D.C. Sniper.</i>

06:37.628 --> 06:38.720
I was mad when I found out
dude was black.

06:40.063 --> 06:42.031
Hold on there, Terri.

06:42.132 --> 06:45.863
The D.C. Sniper is like
the Jackie Robinson of crime.

06:45.969 --> 06:47.402
What?!

06:48.539 --> 06:50.234
Tell them, Eddie.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.241
He broke into the white leagues
with that crime.

06:54.962 --> 06:58.420
That crime took planning.
Not only planning, it took math.

06:58.532 --> 07:02.992
You know, it took math
to figure out all them trajectories

07:03.103 --> 07:05.628
to shoot from the back
of an automobile.

07:05.739 --> 07:08.537
That's white-folk shit right there.

07:08.642 --> 07:11.736
With the problems we got,
black folks used to could say,

07:11.845 --> 07:13.210
"At least we ain't crazy. "

07:13.313 --> 07:14.746
Our crimes made sense.

07:14.848 --> 07:18.113
Ain't got no money,
rob somebody with money.

07:18.218 --> 07:21.244
Black folks are just as crazy
as white folks.

07:22.956 --> 07:25.322
Mike Tyson...
he's like three crazy people.

07:25.425 --> 07:26.392
Prince?

07:26.493 --> 07:28.085
Hold on, hold on now.

07:28.195 --> 07:30.663
He half Cherokee or something.
Don't put him in with us.

07:31.598 --> 07:33.065
DVDs, CDs. Ike Turner's
greatest hits with Tina on the cover.

07:34.483 --> 07:36.110
Got something
you ain't gonna believe...

07:36.218 --> 07:37.913
R. Kelly on tape
with grown women.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.989
<i>I got Grandmas Gone Wild.
You ever seen wrinkles in a thong?</i>

07:41.090 --> 07:43.285
Fred, don't buy nothing
from that fool.

07:43.392 --> 07:46.020
<i>That Nemo tape I got for my son
has a crack deal on it.</i>

07:46.128 --> 07:48.995
- Why you always lyin' on me?
- Ain't nobody lyin' on you.

07:49.098 --> 07:52.067
Line me up.
I got a meeting in 19 minutes.

07:52.168 --> 07:54.762
Head to your meeting
'cause I got next.

07:54.870 --> 07:57.031
K- Rod called and booked
the spot after that,

07:57.139 --> 08:01.974
but I can get you at 3:45
or 11:00 on Tuesday.

08:03.179 --> 08:06.979
You a superstar now?
The Eminem of the barber world?

08:07.082 --> 08:09.516
Yeah, that's why
they call me Slim Fadin'.

08:09.618 --> 08:11.779
This used to be my chair.

08:11.887 --> 08:14.355
Wasn't but two seconds ago
your pasty Pilgrim ass

08:14.457 --> 08:15.685
was sitting at that front seat
and nobody was feeling you.

08:17.026 --> 08:19.620
Well, they're feeling me now.

08:19.728 --> 08:21.559
I'll touch you up.

08:30.406 --> 08:33.203
My customer's running late,
so I can take you.

08:34.342 --> 08:35.605
Cool.

08:40.182 --> 08:41.149
Hi.

08:41.250 --> 08:42.511
Hello.

08:47.289 --> 08:49.553
So...

08:49.658 --> 08:52.354
what's it like
working for Alderman Brown?

08:52.461 --> 08:56.921
It's good.
The alderman is a great mentor.

08:57.032 --> 08:59.660
Must be nice doing
what you said you'd always do.

09:00.402 --> 09:02.461
I really admire that.

09:04.607 --> 09:06.575
- Apple juice?
- What's going on here?

09:06.675 --> 09:08.870
Who set this up?
This shit ain't funny.

09:08.978 --> 09:11.674
- What?
- This. You being nice to me?

09:11.780 --> 09:14.840
You admire me? You got back
together with Kevin, didn't you?

09:14.950 --> 09:18.044
I do not need a man
to make me feel good.

09:18.153 --> 09:20.314
Plus, I'm trying to be
at peace with myself.

09:20.422 --> 09:21.252
I don't know this woman.

09:22.976 --> 09:24.671
Would you know me if I shoved
my foot up your ass?

09:24.777 --> 09:26.836
Oh, yes, there she goes.

09:27.413 --> 09:28.402
Let's go.

09:28.514 --> 09:30.914
Lookin' good, Mr. Stewart.
Now you can get your swerve on.

09:31.017 --> 09:33.383
Calvin, when you get my age,
you don't swerve.

09:33.486 --> 09:36.421
You just be happy gettin'
that bad boy out of park.

09:36.522 --> 09:37.955
You tell him.

09:38.057 --> 09:40.719
You got something smaller?
I don't got change.

09:40.827 --> 09:43.421
- Just keep it.
- You ain't got to tell me twice.

09:43.529 --> 09:45.394
What'd you do,
hit the lotto?

09:45.498 --> 09:47.625
- I sold the cleaners.
- What?

09:47.734 --> 09:50.635
Yep, sold it.
Time for early retirement.

09:50.737 --> 09:53.535
Quality Land Development came in
and made me an offer.

09:53.639 --> 09:56.699
More money than I'd ever seen.
I jumped at it.

09:56.809 --> 10:00.609
- What are they going to put in?
- A Kinko's or something.

10:00.713 --> 10:04.046
I heard they was gonna move
a Subway over there.

10:04.150 --> 10:06.141
A Subway and a Blockbuster.

10:06.252 --> 10:08.447
Yep. White folk
is coming back.

10:08.554 --> 10:10.522
They tryin'
to make money on a brother.

10:10.623 --> 10:13.456
This ain't about
white folks comin' back.

10:13.559 --> 10:15.049
Most of these businesses
coming in are black-owned.

10:16.478 --> 10:18.378
This whole block
is gonna get upgrades.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.176
They can tear down
all this mess around here.

10:21.283 --> 10:22.511
Change is a good thing.

10:22.885 --> 10:26.446
Long as they ain't buildin' liquor stores
and titty bars, I'm cool with it.

10:26.555 --> 10:28.147
Wait a minute now, Calvin.

10:28.257 --> 10:31.522
If they build a titty bar across
the street, I ain't never goin' home.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.627
Hey, babe!

10:36.732 --> 10:38.131
Here's your shit.
I burned the rest of it.

10:39.635 --> 10:41.500
The next time
you want to call yourself

10:41.603 --> 10:43.935
sleeping around
behind somebody's back,

10:44.039 --> 10:46.098
make sure
she look like something

10:46.208 --> 10:47.869
'cause I heard
all of your little shit.

10:47.976 --> 10:52.106
Your cell called the house,
and I heard all two minutes of it.

10:53.782 --> 10:56.444
No, I didn't hear it?
Are you trying to call me a liar?

10:56.552 --> 11:00.113
I don't even see how you could
cheat on me with your toddler penis.

11:00.222 --> 11:01.655
I hope you had a good time.

11:01.757 --> 11:05.318
The next time you come back,
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.

11:07.045 --> 11:09.878
I got a sword, I got an ax,
a box of bullets,

11:09.981 --> 11:13.974
and I'm gonna get both of my babies'
daddies to jump on that ass!

11:16.503 --> 11:17.834
What does she gotta have
both of them for?

11:17.938 --> 11:18.768
Shut up!

11:23.310 --> 11:29.476
Like I was sayin', if they
build a titty bar across the street,

11:29.583 --> 11:31.175
I ain't never goin' home.

11:32.903 --> 11:34.803
You couldn't go home
if you wanted to.

11:39.909 --> 11:42.742
You act like you know
what you're doing.

11:42.846 --> 11:43.938
Please, man.

11:59.211 --> 12:02.510
Now watch this. Balance.
No. Balance.

12:02.615 --> 12:03.741
Balance.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.477
What is all that Circus Dee Soleil
that you're doin'?

12:06.585 --> 12:09.679
All that flippity hippity
stompity stoobily-doo.

12:09.789 --> 12:11.222
It ain't necessary
to cut nobody head.

12:15.027 --> 12:18.326
What's up, dawg?
I don't get the "I"?

12:18.431 --> 12:22.197
Come on, dawg.
You know I gotta have the "I."

12:22.301 --> 12:23.268
Stop playin'.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.800
- Where do you want it?
- Right here.

12:38.517 --> 12:41.418
Tight!

12:42.955 --> 12:45.583
That mess ain't right.
I want my rent money on the first.

12:45.691 --> 12:48.854
Not the second, not...
Hold on, let me finish my thought.

12:48.961 --> 12:51.953
Not the second,
'cause I'm not the bad guy here.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.656
Am I the bad guy here?

12:56.969 --> 12:58.266
Come here.

13:00.239 --> 13:01.206
Check it out, little man.

13:01.307 --> 13:02.797
One thing you're gonna constantly
have to deal with in your life,

13:05.560 --> 13:07.528
and that's broke-ass
black folks.

13:07.629 --> 13:11.030
They gonna be hard to spot
'cause they dressed real nice.

13:11.132 --> 13:14.363
Don't let that fool you,
'cause the nicer they dress,

13:14.469 --> 13:16.699
usually the broker they are.

13:17.438 --> 13:20.100
I like hanging with you.

13:20.208 --> 13:23.644
You know, this is gonna
be yours one day... all of this.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.314
Hey, Calvin, you goin'
over to Emma's?

13:27.415 --> 13:31.317
Tell her my niece sent her
a graduation picture Friday.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.252
- Bring me back a sweet potato pie.
- I ain't bringing you back nothin'.

13:40.378 --> 13:42.573
Hey, Keisha.
Where Janelle at?

13:42.680 --> 13:44.648
She's not here yet.
Hey, boo.

13:44.749 --> 13:46.512
Now, why you even go there?

13:46.618 --> 13:50.145
You can read a calendar.
You know she called in sick.

13:50.254 --> 13:54.281
I need my rent money.
The bank want they money on the first.

13:54.392 --> 13:57.190
I need my money on the first,
not the second and not the 15th.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.956
Come here, Coley.

13:59.063 --> 14:02.863
Come here. Your mommy
leave you with this crazy man?

14:02.967 --> 14:06.095
Crazy? I'm about to
drop him off at Miss Emma's.

14:07.071 --> 14:08.595
Ain't that right?

14:08.706 --> 14:11.732
You know, your daddy used to like
to play with those, too.

14:11.843 --> 14:14.141
- And this.
- Watch your mouth, girl.

14:14.245 --> 14:16.213
They can remember that shit...
I mean stuff.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.782
- Y'all see Calvin baby boy?
- Hey, Coley.

14:18.883 --> 14:21.113
You know that should have
been your baby.

14:21.219 --> 14:22.709
I know.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.813
After Calvin and I stopped dating,
he started thinkin' small.

14:26.924 --> 14:30.325
He opted for the Happy Meal
instead of the Super Size.

14:30.428 --> 14:32.055
No, he opted for less drama.

14:33.781 --> 14:37.410
- It's her six-foot Pocahontas weave.
- That's what it is.

14:37.518 --> 14:40.646
She ain't weavin' it up
like most of y'all in here.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.951
Y'all just mad 'cause she got
a little Indian in her family.

14:44.057 --> 14:47.151
Please. That girl got
perm in her family.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.058
Why every time I come in here,
you start up with me?

14:49.162 --> 14:51.426
You know I got love for you.

14:51.532 --> 14:55.798
If you got that much love for me,
tell Janelle to give me my rent

14:55.903 --> 14:57.962
before I turn off the power in here

14:58.071 --> 15:00.869
and have all you ladies
runnin' out screaming.

15:01.542 --> 15:02.634
Bye, Gina.

15:03.010 --> 15:05.843
How come you not
playing with Coley?

15:05.946 --> 15:09.177
You're just my baby.
Yes, he is.

15:13.754 --> 15:16.188
Stop. Say grace first.

15:18.892 --> 15:20.484
Jesus wept.

15:20.594 --> 15:21.686
Why?

15:22.529 --> 15:23.655
Why what?

15:23.764 --> 15:26.528
Why did Jesus weep?

15:26.633 --> 15:29.864
- 'Cause he was sad.
- Why was he sad?

15:31.171 --> 15:33.867
'Cause they didn't let him
eat his biscuit.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.568
Now, you know I helped
raise you better than that.

15:36.677 --> 15:38.736
Raised you like you was
my own son.

15:38.845 --> 15:40.779
Okay. I gotta go, Miss Emma.

15:41.815 --> 15:45.376
When you get back here,
you better tell me why Jesus wept.

15:50.107 --> 15:51.734
You know what?
He probably was mad

15:51.842 --> 15:55.573
'cause they wouldn't let him put
jelly on his biscuit before he left.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.600
I ain't seen you in two days.

16:19.703 --> 16:22.263
And why you look so damn tired?

16:22.373 --> 16:24.534
Ricky, just be a man
and let me know.

16:24.642 --> 16:25.700
I'm being a man.

16:25.810 --> 16:28.142
If you got somebody else,
then just say it.

16:28.245 --> 16:30.907
You don't need to be slippin'
and slidin' and hidin'.

16:31.015 --> 16:33.347
Nobody hidin'.
This ain't no subterfuge.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.749
- I just been busy.
- Doin' what?

16:35.853 --> 16:38.822
'Cause you sure ain't doin' me.
Who you doin'?

16:38.923 --> 16:41.517
And what the hell
is a subter-fudge?

16:41.625 --> 16:44.253
Listen, you know how it is,
all right?

16:44.361 --> 16:46.591
When we together,
we together.

16:46.697 --> 16:48.665
And when we not, we not.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.868
That Ricky, he's the man.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.834
Please. He's a clown.

16:53.938 --> 16:55.997
Be like Mike,
not like Rick.

16:56.107 --> 16:59.338
If I was like Mike,
would you like me?

16:59.443 --> 17:00.705
- Brad Pitt.
- Mel Gibson.

17:02.429 --> 17:03.896
- Bill Clinton.
- Bill Clinton?

17:03.997 --> 17:07.397
He's a freak,
and I likes me a freaky man.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.025
If I had to choose me
a white boy to sleep with,

17:10.136 --> 17:11.762
- I'd have to say Mini-Me.
- Mini-Me?

17:11.871 --> 17:12.769
Use your head.

17:14.190 --> 17:16.214
- What?
- What?

17:16.326 --> 17:18.988
Use your head.

17:19.095 --> 17:20.493
You bad girl!

17:23.398 --> 17:26.027
Excuse me, Miss Watson.
I'm sorry.

17:26.136 --> 17:27.694
Hey, Dinka.

17:27.804 --> 17:29.396
- Good morning.
- What's up, D?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.838
Thank you, Dinka.
They look great.

17:31.941 --> 17:34.102
- Beautiful shoes.
- Thank you, Dinka.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.351
Damn a Mini-Me.
I'll take me one of those.

17:43.453 --> 17:46.718
All I'm saying is we need
to keep our eye on Trent Lott.

17:46.823 --> 17:48.916
We need to know where
his ass is at all times. He racist!

17:50.643 --> 17:53.077
He's the poster child
for stupid white men.

17:53.178 --> 17:56.238
I don't know about that.
Dan Quayle couldn't spell "potato. "

17:56.348 --> 17:59.249
You know what?
You right about that, Checkers.

17:59.351 --> 18:00.409
You know what?

18:00.519 --> 18:04.615
You can be a stupid white man
and get elected president. Twice!

18:04.723 --> 18:08.420
All I'm saying is
if you're gonna have oral relations

18:08.527 --> 18:12.019
with an ugly, fat white girl
with low self-esteem, lock the door.

18:15.117 --> 18:17.017
Lock the door! Click.

18:17.119 --> 18:18.848
Handle your business.

18:18.954 --> 18:20.251
There it is.

18:22.858 --> 18:24.018
Calvin, come look.

18:24.126 --> 18:27.220
They're gonna lock your ass up
for talkin' like that.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.228
When did they put that up?

18:34.336 --> 18:36.304
Guess it ain't no titty bar.

18:39.608 --> 18:40.836
Hold up.

18:44.513 --> 18:46.105
I can't believe this.

18:47.549 --> 18:49.642
- Quentin!
- Hey, Calvin.

18:50.485 --> 18:53.283
You like our sign?
Not too flashy, I hope.

18:53.388 --> 18:56.414
I don't want it to fight
the funk of the neighborhood.

18:56.525 --> 18:59.619
I thought this was a club.
What is Nappy Cutz?

18:59.728 --> 19:01.127
You never heard of us?

19:01.229 --> 19:04.596
It's a franchise, the black man's
answer to Supercuts.

19:04.699 --> 19:06.291
Got ten locations nationwide.

19:07.335 --> 19:10.168
This'll be the first one
in Chicago.

19:10.272 --> 19:14.003
Ten chairs with every amenity
the African-American male desires.

19:15.727 --> 19:16.751
- On my block?
- It's just an alternative.

19:16.861 --> 19:18.726
You the man.
Your shop is legendary.

19:18.830 --> 19:21.355
Only business on the block
to survive the riots of '68.

19:21.466 --> 19:22.933
We can't compete with you.

19:25.870 --> 19:27.064
I gotta go.

19:27.171 --> 19:31.540
Listen, when 24/7 opens,
I'd love to buy you a latte.

19:31.642 --> 19:34.406
I can buy
my own damn latte.

19:34.512 --> 19:38.676
I know what this is.
You're tryin' to compete with us.

19:40.818 --> 19:42.752
It's not a competition.

19:44.021 --> 19:45.648
It's a rout.

19:45.756 --> 19:48.589
Your business will be closed
in six months, seven at the most.

19:48.693 --> 19:50.684
When the bank forecloses,
I'm gonna buy your shop

19:50.795 --> 19:52.854
and turn it
into a more viable cash cow,

19:52.964 --> 19:55.194
like a Bally's
or a Jamba Juice.

19:55.299 --> 19:58.666
We could bypass all the stress
if you would sell it to me now.

20:00.371 --> 20:03.704
But of course you wouldn't
do that... too much pride.

20:03.808 --> 20:05.605
And I respect that.

20:10.448 --> 20:12.109
I respect that, too.

20:19.724 --> 20:21.123
You be safe out there.

20:21.225 --> 20:23.693
I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

20:27.298 --> 20:30.062
What did slick-head negro want?

20:30.167 --> 20:33.068
These guys fittin'
to open a shop on our block?

20:33.170 --> 20:35.138
They're gonna take
all our customers.

20:35.239 --> 20:37.036
Quality Land Development
buyin' up everything.

20:37.141 --> 20:38.938
We just gotta
step up our game.

20:39.677 --> 20:42.237
Hey, Rick, you handled
that deposit for me?

20:46.217 --> 20:49.118
You gonna have to cool it
on these extra activities.

20:49.220 --> 20:52.951
I don't care about your vampire hours
as long as you do what I ask.

20:53.057 --> 20:54.752
It's not what you think.

20:54.859 --> 20:56.759
- I had some...
- Some bullshit to do.

20:56.861 --> 20:59.489
You should've asked me,
someone more dependable.

20:59.597 --> 21:01.121
Both of you can kiss my ass.

21:01.232 --> 21:04.599
Hold up, don't fall apart.
Don't fall apart.

21:04.702 --> 21:06.033
Not right now, okay?

21:06.137 --> 21:08.367
We got competition on the block.

21:08.472 --> 21:10.667
And I guess change,
that's a good thing, right?

21:12.093 --> 21:15.426
Well, it's free enterprise.
This is America.

21:15.530 --> 21:16.622
Shut up, Dinka.

21:16.731 --> 21:20.258
- Survival of the fittest.
- Says the privileged white boy.

21:20.368 --> 21:23.201
The privileged white boy
do a better job on that fade.

21:24.339 --> 21:26.830
You're starting to cross the line.
Relax yourself.

21:26.941 --> 21:28.875
Quit it. Quit it.

21:29.911 --> 21:32.471
Don't sweat it, Cal.
We got your back no matter what.

21:32.580 --> 21:36.209
Come on, everybody, let's go back.
This ain't nothin'.

21:36.317 --> 21:39.081
I've seen this many times.
They come and they go.

21:39.187 --> 21:41.883
We gonna be all right.
We gonna be fine.

21:41.990 --> 21:45.585
- Man, why you trippin' back there?
- Why you frontin', man?

21:45.693 --> 21:47.684
I know you're
supposed to be the superstar,

21:47.796 --> 21:50.788
but don't you ever
roll up on my customers.

21:50.899 --> 21:53.094
- What was you thinkin'?
- You're right, man.

21:53.201 --> 21:56.466
Okay, it's my bad.
It's my bad.

21:56.571 --> 21:58.869
His fade was
a little crooked, though.

22:01.076 --> 22:03.442
It's hard being that good, ain't it?

22:03.545 --> 22:06.309
Look, Cal,
it's nappy-cutz. Com.

22:07.415 --> 22:08.848
<i>It's the professionalism
that is bestowed upon me</i>

22:11.402 --> 22:13.666
<i>when I come into Nappy Cutz
that I appreciate.</i>

22:13.771 --> 22:15.602
Did that boy say
"bestowed upon me"?

22:15.706 --> 22:16.832
That's what it sounded like.

22:16.940 --> 22:18.965
<i>It's the bikini waxes
that I love...</i>

22:19.076 --> 22:20.737
Look at the couches, man,
and the lighting.

22:20.844 --> 22:22.072
Look at that.

22:22.179 --> 22:23.942
<i>Last week
I had me a milk bath.</i>

22:24.048 --> 22:25.640
What?

22:25.749 --> 22:26.943
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

22:27.051 --> 22:29.519
They dippin' sisters
in milk over there?

22:29.620 --> 22:33.750
Give me some cookies.
I'll go over there myself.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.291
Was that...

22:38.395 --> 22:40.955
- That was him!
- It looked like him.

22:41.065 --> 22:43.033
That's a look-alike.
How can they get him?

22:43.133 --> 22:44.464
Turn that mess off.

22:45.602 --> 22:48.036
That little girl is nasty!

22:49.139 --> 22:50.231
Back to work.

22:50.341 --> 22:52.935
Checker Fred, back to checkers.

22:53.043 --> 22:55.511
My boys up in Memphis
go to Nappy Cut.

22:55.612 --> 22:57.603
They said it's off the chain.

22:57.715 --> 22:59.546
They got honeys in bikinis,

22:59.650 --> 23:01.584
be serving wine when they
walk through the door.

23:01.685 --> 23:02.913
That ain't nothin'.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.148
I heard they got fish
in the floor, swimming.

23:06.256 --> 23:07.814
You standin' on top of them.

23:07.925 --> 23:10.587
You could pick a fish out,
get it baked, broiled,

23:10.694 --> 23:14.061
fried, grilled,
fondued, souffléd,

23:14.164 --> 23:16.223
- sautéed, sushied, all that.
- Fondued?

23:16.333 --> 23:18.631
I like that whole massage thing.

23:18.736 --> 23:19.964
That's tight.

23:20.070 --> 23:21.799
Let me tell you all somethin'.

23:21.905 --> 23:23.736
That's not a real barbershop.

23:23.841 --> 23:28.039
That's a fake, franchise,
corporate version of a barbershop.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.669
That's why they got gimmicks.

23:29.780 --> 23:32.408
They ain't got
no real character up in there.

23:32.516 --> 23:36.077
A real barbershop got real people,
real conversation,

23:36.186 --> 23:39.155
and most of all, real barbers,
and that's what we got here.

23:40.324 --> 23:41.985
Calvin, my man!

23:42.092 --> 23:43.582
Oh, God.

23:43.694 --> 23:46.288
Kenard. Hold up.
Dude, look...

23:46.397 --> 23:48.262
I love you, cuz.
I love you, man.

23:48.365 --> 23:50.458
I finished barber school
on Wednesday,

23:50.567 --> 23:52.364
and now I'm working
in a shop today.

23:52.469 --> 23:55.563
That's how family
supposed to do for each other.

23:55.672 --> 23:58.607
- Did Jennifer call you?
- I spoke to her this morning.

23:58.709 --> 24:01.439
Did she tell you that
maybe I'll try you out? Maybe?

24:01.545 --> 24:02.978
I'm down with trying out.

24:03.080 --> 24:06.743
I'm about to be
Rookie of the Year up in here.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.743
That's me, man?

24:11.321 --> 24:14.290
Baby, you're putting me
in the front chair?

24:14.391 --> 24:16.291
The best chair in the shop.

24:16.393 --> 24:18.588
That's how family
supposed to do.

24:18.695 --> 24:20.390
You right, too much love.

24:20.497 --> 24:23.523
What's up, player?
How you feelin'? All right.

24:23.634 --> 24:26.125
Freddie Douglass!
You old school! Come on.

24:26.236 --> 24:29.171
You can do it.
Come on, now. All right!

24:29.273 --> 24:30.604
What's up, girlfriend?

24:32.242 --> 24:34.073
Okay, okay.
What's up, brother?

24:34.178 --> 24:35.736
Everything cool?

24:35.846 --> 24:37.609
Don't leave me hanging.

24:37.714 --> 24:39.807
Mutombo!
What'd you shave your head for?

24:39.917 --> 24:42.886
I'm with you, brother.
We goin' back to Africa.

24:46.190 --> 24:47.521
Beauties.

24:48.959 --> 24:50.119
Hello.

24:50.694 --> 24:51.820
Mia!

24:54.364 --> 24:55.353
Naomi!

24:55.466 --> 24:57.627
You know you know me.

24:58.669 --> 25:00.933
I know you not gonna let him
put them pictures up,

25:01.038 --> 25:03.836
not when you made me
take Lola Falana down.

25:03.941 --> 25:05.203
Kenard.

25:05.309 --> 25:07.470
It's a probationary period.

25:07.578 --> 25:10.741
You understand probation,
don't you?

25:10.848 --> 25:12.042
Who is this orphan?

25:13.667 --> 25:14.531
All right, all right.

25:15.703 --> 25:17.637
Rich, where you at, man?

25:17.738 --> 25:21.174
Ain't never seen nothin'
like that in your life.

25:22.643 --> 25:23.905
Yeah, that's good.

25:25.346 --> 25:26.643
Tighten myself up.

25:26.747 --> 25:29.511
Yo, Big C, explain him.

25:30.284 --> 25:32.616
Call my wife, man.
That's her people.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.982
Damn.

25:34.755 --> 25:36.882
Who's next?
Come on.

25:36.991 --> 25:39.892
Have a seat right here.
Kenard's chair.

25:43.864 --> 25:46.298
That aroma is
kind of gettin' to me.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.230
What kind of coffee is that?

25:48.953 --> 25:52.389
It's not a coffee.
It's a chai with soy.

25:52.489 --> 25:54.957
Okay, so it's herbal.
Yeah, it's herbal.

25:55.059 --> 25:58.119
You must be a lot like me.
You lactose intolerant.

25:58.228 --> 26:01.129
Yeah, I'm lactose intolerant.
I go near a cow,

26:01.231 --> 26:04.462
and my behind blow up
like Dizzy Gillespie.

26:05.135 --> 26:06.830
Downright flatulent.

26:07.771 --> 26:09.068
And the smell.

26:09.173 --> 26:11.437
Man, the smell that come
out of there,

26:11.542 --> 26:14.102
it's so bad, sometimes
I have to set myself outside.

26:14.211 --> 26:16.679
I'm not lactose intolerant,
all right?

26:16.780 --> 26:20.011
I have a very healthy metabolism.

26:20.117 --> 26:24.816
I tried to have some of them little,
bitty Milky Ways... the small one.

26:24.922 --> 26:27.254
I ate two of them
at a party one night,

26:27.357 --> 26:29.484
and, man, it just got...

26:32.396 --> 26:36.264
I just couldn't control it.
It was the lactose intoleration.

26:36.366 --> 26:38.459
Listen, I'm not lactose intolerant.

26:38.569 --> 26:42.801
Look, man, all that's fine.
I'm trying to help you.

26:42.906 --> 26:44.999
It's just not fair
for your date.

26:45.109 --> 26:47.669
You gotta think about
if you on a date

26:47.778 --> 26:50.042
and you up here
sneakin' 'em off,

26:50.147 --> 26:52.274
and she's trying to wonder,

26:52.382 --> 26:56.751
"He seem like he dressed nice,
he seems clean, but what is that smell?"

26:56.854 --> 26:59.914
And you tryin' to act like
you ain't got no...

27:00.023 --> 27:02.548
Take care of yourself.

27:02.659 --> 27:05.992
Sir, I am very nice
to black people, okay?

27:06.096 --> 27:07.188
Nice to black people?

27:07.297 --> 27:09.390
You better be,
especially me.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.060
I keep my stuff with me, okay?
I cut you.

27:12.169 --> 27:16.697
You can look me up on the Internet,
www. cut-a-mother. com.

27:16.807 --> 27:19.435
That's me right there
lookin' at you.

27:26.984 --> 27:28.918
- Hey, watch it!
- Move!

27:43.367 --> 27:45.699
Your precious love

27:50.874 --> 27:52.774
Your precious love

27:54.778 --> 27:59.078
Heaven must have sent you
from above

27:59.183 --> 28:01.549
Must have sent you, baby

28:01.652 --> 28:05.850
Heaven must have sent
your precious love

28:05.956 --> 28:09.221
Your precious love

28:09.326 --> 28:12.124
To find a love like ours

28:12.229 --> 28:13.423
Stop!

28:14.264 --> 28:17.495
- To find
- To find

28:17.601 --> 28:18.727
With your finger.

28:18.836 --> 28:20.201
To find

28:20.404 --> 28:22.304
To find

28:22.406 --> 28:24.499
Your finger goin' up there,
but you not.

28:24.608 --> 28:27.236
I need to find a new tenor.

28:27.344 --> 28:31.178
Man. I wish
my brother Darnell was out.

28:44.094 --> 28:46.119
Eddie, where you goin'?

29:00.393 --> 29:02.691
What the hell's
the matter with you?

29:04.964 --> 29:06.488
Taxi!

29:09.102 --> 29:11.866
- Get out of the way, fool!
- I can't wait for you.

29:25.218 --> 29:27.914
There's a guy
on the other side of the rig!

29:31.391 --> 29:34.258
Get off the truck!
Get off!

30:08.444 --> 30:10.412
You wanna know my name, right?

30:10.513 --> 30:11.980
Yeah.

30:12.081 --> 30:13.742
Loretta.

30:16.285 --> 30:17.616
Yeah.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.187
I'm not saying
we made out of money.

30:28.297 --> 30:30.891
I'm just saying we need
to step it up a little bit.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.332
We're about to get punked
by Nappy Cutz.

30:33.436 --> 30:35.631
If you don't think big,
you'll never be big.

30:35.738 --> 30:39.538
Calvin, you run a family operation.
You do not need to step it up.

30:39.642 --> 30:43.408
Them clowns at Nappy Cutz, they're not
about to take away your business.

30:43.512 --> 30:46.777
Your shop is
a neighborhood institution.

30:46.882 --> 30:47.940
Come on.

30:48.050 --> 30:51.042
People don't care about institutions.
They got fish in the floor.

30:52.021 --> 30:53.488
Just swimmin' around.

30:53.589 --> 30:57.685
You can get it fried, baked,
sautéed, sushi...

30:57.793 --> 31:01.194
- Who told you that?
- Little Rodney at the shop.

31:01.297 --> 31:04.391
Little Rodney told you
he sawfish in the floor.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.196
Well, he actually didn't see
the fish in the floor,

31:07.303 --> 31:08.827
but his cousin in Atlanta
sawfish.

31:08.938 --> 31:09.927
You know that's ridiculous.

31:11.356 --> 31:13.415
Little Rodney probably
heard it from somebody

31:13.525 --> 31:15.755
who heard it from somebody else
who was at Nappy Cutz

31:15.861 --> 31:18.159
<i>when they dropped their
Filet-O-Fish on the floor.</i>

31:24.236 --> 31:26.932
That's ridiculous.
I can't believe you said that.

31:35.080 --> 31:38.572
Sun salutation, ladies.

31:38.684 --> 31:42.643
Feet together,
bringing it to prayer pose.

31:42.754 --> 31:45.882
And reach!

31:47.609 --> 31:50.077
Butterfly, butterfly.

31:50.845 --> 31:52.676
Bringing it back to prayer pose.

31:54.182 --> 31:56.309
<i>Deep ujjayi breath.</i>

31:56.417 --> 31:58.408
Breathing in radiance,

31:58.519 --> 32:01.545
beauty, light.

32:02.323 --> 32:05.019
Breathing out
any heavy burdens.

32:05.126 --> 32:09.825
The key to enlightenment
is to work through your anger,

32:09.931 --> 32:12.729
not have your anger
work through you.

32:14.469 --> 32:15.834
First position.

32:18.106 --> 32:19.664
One, two, three.

32:19.774 --> 32:22.072
He ain't shit!
He ain't shit!

32:34.756 --> 32:37.190
Jimmy! What's the deal?

32:37.291 --> 32:38.553
What's up?

32:40.595 --> 32:42.722
Lookin' good, baby boy!

32:42.830 --> 32:44.695
Always, always.

32:44.799 --> 32:46.027
Still ain't shit.

32:46.134 --> 32:47.396
Just a little while ago,
he was cuttin' hair.

32:50.988 --> 32:53.889
- Good morning. Good morning.
- Alderman Brown's office.

32:53.991 --> 32:55.458
- Good morning, Maggie.
- Good morning, sir.

32:55.559 --> 32:58.926
- Any messages?
- Yes, sir. A whole stack.

33:01.432 --> 33:02.990
- Good morning, Alderman.
- Good morning.

33:03.100 --> 33:05.967
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Jimmy.

33:06.070 --> 33:09.471
- I'd like a moment if you have it.
- I don't. This faithful constituent

33:09.573 --> 33:11.768
is in need of counsel,
and I have to provide it.

33:11.876 --> 33:14.208
Reach one, teach one.
Remember that.

33:14.311 --> 33:17.712
It's an issue of vital importance
and it'll only take a minute.

33:19.984 --> 33:22.544
- You have 59 seconds.
- Thank you.

33:24.588 --> 33:27.056
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

33:27.158 --> 33:28.182
Not you.

33:31.428 --> 33:33.896
I wanted to bring to your attention
a particular concern of mine.

33:33.998 --> 33:36.023
Are you familiar with Calvin's Barbershop
on 79th and Exchange?

33:38.052 --> 33:40.714
Yeah, I'm aware of it.

33:40.821 --> 33:43.381
They're opening a Nappy Cutz
across the street.

33:43.491 --> 33:46.119
Yeah, I know all about it.

33:46.961 --> 33:49.259
Shouldn't we do something
about that?

33:52.466 --> 33:53.763
Why should we?

33:53.868 --> 33:57.201
Competition is
a cornerstone of democracy.

33:57.304 --> 34:00.273
The future is not what it used to be.
Remember that.

34:00.374 --> 34:04.743
But you did say you wanted
to keep that particular area fertile

34:04.845 --> 34:06.540
for small-business interests.

34:06.647 --> 34:10.047
Fertile.
I did say that, didn't I?

34:10.150 --> 34:14.610
This boy is gonna be the governor
of the state of Illinois one day

34:14.722 --> 34:17.246
if he learns to do what I say
when I say it.

34:18.125 --> 34:22.619
Now, I'm not one for explanations,
explanatory things explained.

34:22.730 --> 34:25.824
Write a report and have it
on my desk by the end of the month.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.424
Sir, I think we should move
faster than that.

34:28.536 --> 34:31.369
Think need, not speed.

34:31.472 --> 34:36.101
It's better to measure
a thing ten times and cut once

34:36.210 --> 34:39.407
than to measure once
and cut ten times.

34:39.513 --> 34:41.879
Your minute is up, son.

34:49.623 --> 34:51.784
This is gonna be great
for the neighborhood.

34:51.891 --> 34:53.324
We'll see.

34:53.427 --> 34:54.951
Here he comes.

34:58.265 --> 35:00.324
- What's up, Samir?
- Not much.

35:00.434 --> 35:01.901
- How are you doing?
- All right.

35:02.002 --> 35:04.368
Very nice shirt on you.

35:04.471 --> 35:06.496
We need to talk to you, Calvin.

35:06.607 --> 35:07.972
What's going on?

35:08.075 --> 35:10.475
We've been approached
by Quality Land Development.

35:10.578 --> 35:13.342
They're building a cineplex there
and they're making us an offer.

35:13.447 --> 35:15.506
We're thinking
about taking that offer.

35:15.616 --> 35:17.641
The money isn't bad.

35:17.751 --> 35:20.219
Plus, the money isn't bad.

35:20.321 --> 35:24.348
Stew sold him his cleaners and took
his Viagra-popping ass to Miami.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.187
I ain't mad at the brother.

35:26.293 --> 35:29.524
What's that got to do with me?
You got your mind made up.

35:29.630 --> 35:32.793
No, we haven't.
But I bet if you came on board

35:32.900 --> 35:36.199
and sold them the barbershop,
they'd probably pay us double.

35:36.303 --> 35:38.635
- That would change my mind.
- Absolutely.

35:38.739 --> 35:41.037
- Y'all know I can't do that.
- Why not?

35:41.141 --> 35:42.608
We've been there since '58.

35:43.644 --> 35:46.306
So if y'all wanna sell
and go down to Florida

35:46.413 --> 35:49.507
with them funky-ass voting booths,
you can go ahead.

35:49.617 --> 35:51.585
But I've gotta keep mine.

35:51.685 --> 35:52.379
You're making a mistake, bro.

35:53.803 --> 35:57.068
No, my friend, you're thinking
about this all the wrong way.

35:57.173 --> 36:00.336
Calvin, there's a lot of money
to be made here, son.

36:00.443 --> 36:01.842
Go talk to your boy.

36:02.879 --> 36:05.848
Come on, babies.
Today is the day.

36:05.949 --> 36:08.679
We came a long road
to get here.

36:08.785 --> 36:09.945
Pay attention.

36:10.053 --> 36:11.645
Lighten up.

36:11.755 --> 36:14.383
You come in here some days

36:14.491 --> 36:16.482
looking like Joe Frazier
in Jamaica.

36:16.593 --> 36:20.154
People don't like that.
You're too pretty.

36:20.263 --> 36:21.662
Learn how to cook.

36:21.765 --> 36:23.027
I know how to cook.

36:23.133 --> 36:26.193
Make him hush puppies
or a Spanish omelet.

36:28.138 --> 36:29.503
- Hey there, Calvin.
- Hey, Calvin.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.432
- What's up, Cal?
- Yo, Isaac.

36:32.542 --> 36:34.271
What's up, boss man?

36:34.377 --> 36:36.504
You all know
why I called this meeting.

36:36.613 --> 36:40.572
Nappy Necks, whatever they want
to call theyself across the street,

36:40.683 --> 36:42.776
is openin' up in three weeks,

36:42.886 --> 36:44.979
and they're tryin' to get
our ass out of here,

36:45.088 --> 36:47.579
like it or not,
and we ain't havin' it.

36:47.690 --> 36:49.749
- You know what I mean?
- Damn straight.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.554
So my plan is this.

36:51.661 --> 36:54.323
Fire up the barbecue in the back,

36:54.430 --> 36:57.888
have a little
customer-appreciation cookout.

36:58.001 --> 37:00.026
That's smart.
That's good thinking.

37:00.703 --> 37:04.537
Just burgers and dogs,
free haircuts for the kids.

37:05.308 --> 37:08.004
Show the people
we care about 'em.

37:08.111 --> 37:10.477
Show them that
whatever they goin' through,

37:10.580 --> 37:12.138
we down with them.

37:12.248 --> 37:13.237
- You feel me?
- I feel you, Calvin.

37:14.968 --> 37:15.662
Definitely.

37:15.768 --> 37:18.066
Man, I feel all of that.

37:18.171 --> 37:19.638
It all makes sense.

37:19.739 --> 37:22.572
That's why I got to raise
your booth rent.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.233
What?

37:24.343 --> 37:25.935
You can't do that.

37:26.045 --> 37:28.639
- It's my first day.
- Why, Calvin?

37:29.182 --> 37:31.446
We got to pay
for this somehow.

37:32.151 --> 37:36.781
Forget about it. We in a crisis,
and you can double my rent.

37:36.889 --> 37:38.880
- You don't even pay no rent.
- What?

37:39.892 --> 37:41.826
In that case, triple it, then.

37:41.928 --> 37:45.159
Not to throw salt, but why
you don't pay no booth rent?

37:45.264 --> 37:49.633
I don't pay rent
'cause I don't pay rent. Okay?

37:49.736 --> 37:53.069
So pour out your cup of haterade
and sop it up off the floor

37:53.172 --> 37:54.764
and get some business.

37:54.874 --> 37:58.469
Also, I want to institute
a couple of new rules.

37:58.578 --> 38:01.308
You comin' at me with too much.

38:01.414 --> 38:03.882
That's all for one day.
Take baby steps.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.097
Rule number one...
no more profanity.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.693
I know you about to say something.
Don't even say it.

38:09.805 --> 38:13.468
I ain't sayin' nothin'.
I'm thinkin' it.

38:14.409 --> 38:16.240
Rule number two...
don't be late.

38:16.345 --> 38:19.473
Who was it that said, "Be on
time for something other than... "

38:19.581 --> 38:22.141
- "... before 11:00 at the club. "
- That's what it was.

38:22.251 --> 38:25.311
Y'all got jokes.
My bad.

38:25.420 --> 38:28.617
<i>Kenard, them Jet beauties,
they got to go, man.</i>

38:28.724 --> 38:30.123
Good.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.989
They're my inspiration,
my muses.

38:33.095 --> 38:35.563
He made me take down
my picture of Lola Falana.

38:35.664 --> 38:37.996
I can't cut without the butt.

38:38.100 --> 38:41.228
That's perfect for me
'cause maybe you'll quit.

38:42.704 --> 38:43.898
That's what I thought.

38:44.006 --> 38:47.737
We're going to be more
family friendly around here,

38:47.843 --> 38:50.505
and I want everybody to start
greeting the customers by name.

38:52.497 --> 38:55.489
How are we supposed to know
everybody's name?

38:55.600 --> 38:56.862
That's ridiculous.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.565
He's not even showing up.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.730
Yap! Yap! Yap! Yap!

39:02.941 --> 39:06.468
All that yapping leads me
to rule number three...

39:06.578 --> 39:09.069
no more loud talking.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.273
What?!

39:25.964 --> 39:27.488
Watch it.

39:36.742 --> 39:37.970
Thank you, Calvin.

39:38.076 --> 39:41.477
Horace, thanks, man.
I appreciate your coming through.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.979
All right, Calvin.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.106
- Take care, man.
- No problem.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.618
- Appreciate your business.
- All right, Calvin.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.415
God bless.

39:51.423 --> 39:52.617
All right, Calvin.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.021
Bye, Horace.

40:00.365 --> 40:01.423
You're next.

40:01.533 --> 40:03.125
What's up, Cal?

40:04.503 --> 40:07.165
Thanks for what you're doing.
We appreciate it.

40:12.444 --> 40:15.379
- Hi, Jimmy!
- Hey, everybody.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.744
This is not happening.
We got an appointment.

40:17.849 --> 40:21.580
You gotta get out of the chair.
Eight Mile gave me this time exactly.

40:21.686 --> 40:22.948
We're almost done.

40:23.055 --> 40:25.717
I'll be right with you.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.691
I'm terribly sorry
about the inconvenience.

40:29.761 --> 40:33.094
Calvin, this is why
black business does not succeed.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.426
We're never on time.

40:34.533 --> 40:38.333
You're always coming in late.
You leave early.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.769
Giving to the needy and the greedy
instead of the deserving.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.306
And double-booking our clients!

40:43.408 --> 40:46.241
Why do you have a schedule
if you ain't gonna use it?

40:46.344 --> 40:50.405
It is 11:02. That means your man
has to get out of the chair.

40:50.515 --> 40:53.643
That means it's my time,
and I'm not havin' it.

40:53.752 --> 40:57.017
Come on, man, you gotta bounce.
This is ridiculous.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.851
Vamoose.
Come on, let's go.

41:00.092 --> 41:03.084
- Get him.
- Sit your ass down!

41:06.765 --> 41:09.325
Come on, have a seat.
Enough of it already.

41:09.434 --> 41:10.025
Sit on down, West Wing.

41:11.452 --> 41:13.920
<i>Up in here like you're from
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.</i>

41:14.021 --> 41:17.582
Only reason you're in here is 'cause
your daddy didn't use a Life Style.

41:17.692 --> 41:21.321
I'll tell y'all one thing...
all y'all are doomed to fail.

41:21.429 --> 41:25.559
It was nice and quiet in here,
the way I like it.

41:25.666 --> 41:29.033
Just hush.
Everything was hush.

41:31.272 --> 41:35.299
Free barbecue... food, fun,
and free haircuts for the kids.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.901
Bring 'em on down.
Bring all the kids.

41:38.012 --> 41:41.743
Here you go, girl.
We should have kids

41:41.849 --> 41:45.341
so we can bring 'em down
to this barbecue Friday.

41:45.453 --> 41:48.581
I think we can squeeze four
out of that ass.

41:48.689 --> 41:50.680
I didn't mean to insult you.
We could probably get five.

41:52.410 --> 41:55.072
What's up, Tyson?
Free barbecue this Friday.

41:55.179 --> 41:58.876
Don't be eyeballin' me.
You ain't hard. I'm just playin'.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.382
Boy, it's hot out here.

42:00.484 --> 42:04.215
I'm tired of handing out these fliers,
but my cousin say I gotta do it.

42:04.321 --> 42:07.654
Before they got his ass,
they was all over there together...

42:07.758 --> 42:11.489
Saddam, Osama, all of them
livin' in a big old beach house

42:11.595 --> 42:12.926
just kickin' it.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.794
Got all the money in the world

42:15.900 --> 42:18.266
and some of them ho's
from the Snoop video.

42:18.369 --> 42:22.305
They just freakin' 'em.
Freakin' em all, boy.

42:22.406 --> 42:25.034
- And Idi Amin over there, too.
- I thought he...

42:25.142 --> 42:28.111
No, no, he ain't dead.
No, he ain't dead.

42:28.212 --> 42:32.512
You can't kill no big
Yaphet Kotto-looking Zulu nigga.

42:32.616 --> 42:35.710
- You know better than that.
- Eddie, you need to quit it.

42:35.819 --> 42:36.911
Let me get some ribs!

42:37.021 --> 42:41.390
- Can I fix you a plate, Dinka?
- No, I'm trying to watch it.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.187
You don't need to watch it.

42:45.829 --> 42:48.059
She throwin' it at you, dawg.
What's up with that?

42:48.165 --> 42:52.625
Shawna is a nice woman,
but I don't know if she's the one for me.

42:52.736 --> 42:55.170
Who the one for you? Terri?

42:55.272 --> 42:57.740
You need to let that go.
That's not gonna happen.

42:57.841 --> 42:59.138
That's the good news.

42:59.243 --> 43:03.577
You don't need a loud, evil,
neck-rollin' chicken-head like Terri.

43:03.681 --> 43:05.945
That's what you need.
Go on.

43:06.884 --> 43:08.579
Go on over there.

43:12.022 --> 43:13.182
Go on.

43:13.757 --> 43:17.921
Isaac, run to the store
and grab me some ice.

43:18.028 --> 43:19.859
We're running short on ice.

43:19.964 --> 43:21.989
Kenard ain't doin' nothin'.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.032
Yeah, man, but I asked you.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.462
Don't do me like that, man.

43:28.572 --> 43:30.802
Can you get me
some ice or not?

43:30.908 --> 43:34.901
No disrespect, Cal, but I've been
bustin' my ass in there for you.

43:35.012 --> 43:37.378
I've been bringin' in
a lot of business.

43:37.481 --> 43:40.006
- I see you.
- So why you treatin' me like a scrub?

43:40.117 --> 43:43.280
I treat you like
everybody else around here.

43:43.387 --> 43:46.788
I'm happy you got it goin' on now,
but I need some ice.

43:46.890 --> 43:48.824
Can you handle that for me?

43:49.860 --> 43:52.021
- Yeah.
- Get the ice.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.687
Two bags.

43:54.898 --> 43:56.661
Thank you, Isaac.

43:57.201 --> 43:58.668
Where you goin'?

43:58.769 --> 44:00.498
Cal wants me
to handle some business.

44:00.604 --> 44:02.128
Store run.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.332
Can you bring back
some toothpicks?

44:05.442 --> 44:08.900
The minty kind.
Minty freshness.

44:09.013 --> 44:10.241
Right on.

44:10.614 --> 44:13.777
Oh, yeah. She want
one of Uncle Eddie's burgers.

44:15.519 --> 44:18.613
That is one right there.
That's delicious.

44:19.690 --> 44:20.884
This is burnt.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.016
No, baby, that ain't burnt.

44:23.127 --> 44:24.458
That's barbecue.

44:25.896 --> 44:27.386
See that brother over there?

44:29.099 --> 44:30.396
That's burnt.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.492
Well, why can't I have
another one?

44:32.603 --> 44:35.333
'Cause you can't.
Now, look, it's free, ain't it?

44:35.439 --> 44:38.465
There's people over
in Ethiopia starvin',

44:38.575 --> 44:40.702
and you sittin'
over here complainin'.

44:40.811 --> 44:43.541
- I'm not gonna eat it.
- You sure ain't.

44:45.349 --> 44:48.614
I hate you!
I'm gonna tell my auntie.

44:49.887 --> 44:51.718
Go to the crack house and tell her.

44:51.822 --> 44:54.256
Ain't nobody scared!
Tell your auntie!

44:54.358 --> 44:56.690
This is Eddie.
I ain't scared of nothin'.

44:56.794 --> 44:59.922
You can tell whoever you want to.

45:00.030 --> 45:03.090
- What'd you do to that little girl?
- I ain't do nothin' to her.

45:03.200 --> 45:06.431
Little Moesha tryin' to criticize
my culinary skill.

45:06.537 --> 45:09.028
I ain't scared!
Get your auntie!

45:09.139 --> 45:11.232
Eddie, man, don't be so crazy.

45:11.342 --> 45:14.470
I should've known your old ass
was startin' trouble.

45:14.578 --> 45:16.910
- Hold on, Gina.
- Oh, shit.

45:17.014 --> 45:19.278
- It was just a misunderstanding.
- Ain't no misunderstanding.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.613
I should've known
you was out here actin' a fool.

45:21.719 --> 45:26.622
I'm tryin' to teach little
Sister Souljah here some discipline.

45:29.075 --> 45:30.872
Now, it's obvious
the way she bein' raised,

45:30.977 --> 45:33.309
she headed
straight for the peniten-sherary.

45:33.413 --> 45:36.712
Raised? Maybe if you stopped
raising your hand to your mouth,

45:36.816 --> 45:39.717
you wouldn't look like Shamu
of the South Side.

45:40.353 --> 45:42.913
Okay. I see where you're
trying to go with it.

45:43.023 --> 45:45.218
What kind of man
treat a little girl that way?

45:45.325 --> 45:47.259
I wouldn't expect you
to know what a man is.

45:48.979 --> 45:50.241
But I'm gonna give you a clue.

45:50.346 --> 45:52.507
Give you a hint,
Throw you a lifeline.

45:52.615 --> 45:55.140
It's one of them things
you can't keep!

45:55.251 --> 45:57.913
Oh, I can keep a man.
I can keep a man.

45:58.021 --> 45:58.988
No, you can't.

45:59.089 --> 46:01.250
I ain't want you, Calvin.
What about you?

46:01.357 --> 46:03.689
The last woman you slept with
was battery-operated.

46:04.227 --> 46:06.593
So? And she was white, too.

46:06.696 --> 46:09.790
I had a black one, but the bitch
didn't knowwhen to keep her mouth shut.

46:11.568 --> 46:14.662
- Why's she gotta be a bitch?
- Why you gotta get up on me?

46:14.771 --> 46:16.966
- Be cool, now.
- Shut up, Calvin.

46:17.073 --> 46:19.132
- Who you tellin' to shut up?
- You.

46:19.242 --> 46:23.144
Everybody get out of here,
little kids and big kids.

46:23.246 --> 46:25.976
I'm gonna tell you
what the problem is.

46:26.082 --> 46:28.983
What's the problem?
What's the problem?

46:29.085 --> 46:32.350
- You don't know your role.
- Know your role. Speak on.

46:32.455 --> 46:35.117
Is you living
in the dark ages or something?

46:35.225 --> 46:38.023
- Do I look like Gina Cleaver?
- Hell, no.

46:38.128 --> 46:41.791
What's your role, watching ESPN
and holding your shit all day?

46:43.900 --> 46:46.596
Ain't nothin' wrong with that.
Nothin' wrong with that.

46:46.703 --> 46:47.795
What you tryin' to say?

46:47.904 --> 46:51.203
Get your lazy ass
off my couch and get a job.

46:51.307 --> 46:52.899
Get a damn job.

46:53.009 --> 46:54.340
Y'all got all the jobs.

46:54.444 --> 46:56.309
- That's kind of true.
- Shut up, Calvin.

46:56.412 --> 46:59.904
You got one more time
to tell me to shut up.

47:00.016 --> 47:02.075
You got a lot of nerve
charging these sisters out here

47:02.185 --> 47:05.382
money to get their hair did,
and you lookin' like Chewbacca.

47:08.358 --> 47:11.521
Don't listen to him.
You look good, girl.

47:11.628 --> 47:14.324
What about you?
Look at that damn 'fro.

47:14.430 --> 47:17.297
What you be doin',
sweepin' up the shop with it?

47:20.103 --> 47:24.563
I do what Calvin
need me to do every now and then.

47:24.674 --> 47:28.770
What Calvin needs you to do is get
off your fat ass and cut some heads.

47:28.878 --> 47:32.211
How you gonna talk about size
when you one Reese's Pieces away

47:32.315 --> 47:34.215
from Jenny Craig yourself?

47:34.317 --> 47:35.477
What you doin'?

47:36.186 --> 47:39.519
I know you ain't...
Don't get in my pool.

47:39.622 --> 47:40.782
I'm in your pool.

47:40.890 --> 47:43.688
Let me tell you something,
you old negro spiritual.

47:43.793 --> 47:45.784
Wadin' in the water

47:45.895 --> 47:48.887
The next time you snatch some food
out of my niece's hand,

47:48.998 --> 47:50.488
I'm gonna kick your ass,

47:50.600 --> 47:52.761
and then I'm gonna burn
your freedom papers.

47:52.869 --> 47:55.303
And trust me,
I'm just big enough to do it.

47:55.405 --> 47:58.533
Can't nobody argue with that.

47:58.641 --> 48:01.109
Don't worry.
She ain't about to do nothin'.

48:01.211 --> 48:05.545
I got a reputation
to keep up around here.

48:05.648 --> 48:08.139
And that little girl
is a devil child, now.

48:08.251 --> 48:10.617
Look, I know she bad.
That's why you come to me.

48:10.720 --> 48:13.211
She got to snappin'
her neck around,

48:13.323 --> 48:14.722
I got to get back at her.

48:14.824 --> 48:18.954
I'm sorry. You make sure
she get that, okay?

48:20.797 --> 48:22.628
Put one of them links on.

48:22.732 --> 48:25.257
- You think she want a link?
- She want a link.

48:25.368 --> 48:27.529
Which one? Right here?

48:27.637 --> 48:30.003
Give me that one right there.

48:30.106 --> 48:32.006
Okay. You give her that, now.

48:32.108 --> 48:34.941
You make sure she get that
and tell her Uncle Eddie's sorry.

48:35.044 --> 48:37.911
- Me and you cool, all right?
- Yeah, we cool.

48:38.014 --> 48:41.245
You got a little somethin'
right there. Get that.

48:41.351 --> 48:43.148
Now get your elbow.

48:43.253 --> 48:45.016
I ain't got nothin'
on my elbow.

48:45.121 --> 48:47.612
Look like a gingerbread man.

48:48.591 --> 48:51.492
I bet that link
don't make it on the inside.

49:43.446 --> 49:45.141
How'd you get with a girl like that?

49:45.248 --> 49:47.478
Get that door
for little Calvin, Junior.

49:47.583 --> 49:50.211
I got what they call
that savoir faire.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.288
She fine.

50:11.407 --> 50:14.240
Now, I know you ain't payin'
that nappy negro no heed.

50:14.344 --> 50:17.871
- Why you even sweatin' it, Cal?
- That Web site's been in my head.

50:17.981 --> 50:20.677
That Web site don't
mean nothin', Cal, man.

50:20.783 --> 50:24.014
Don't even tell you what
it might be like on the inside.

50:24.120 --> 50:26.088
Come on, let's get ready
for our customers.

50:26.189 --> 50:28.180
- Jimmy, hold it there.
- All right.

50:28.291 --> 50:29.849
Yeah, yeah.

51:01.591 --> 51:03.252
What the hell goin' on?

51:07.296 --> 51:11.198
Since y'all wanna be funny,
no rap before 12:00 now.

51:11.300 --> 51:12.597
Come on, man.

51:14.270 --> 51:17.535
Y'all just clownin' up in here.

51:17.640 --> 51:20.473
- Eddie, where the hot wings?
- I tried to tell 'em.

51:22.412 --> 51:25.176
You need a man
that's gonna take care of you.

51:25.281 --> 51:27.340
I'm talkin' about a good man.

51:28.051 --> 51:29.609
A Muslim man.

51:29.719 --> 51:32.313
- And you that man?
- Could be.

51:32.422 --> 51:35.755
Sorry. Once you a customer,
can't have no relations.

51:35.858 --> 51:36.984
Bad for business.

51:37.093 --> 51:38.720
She just had a pork chop.

51:38.828 --> 51:40.955
She ain't tryin' to hear nothin'
about no Nation of Islam.

51:41.064 --> 51:42.554
- Shut up.
- I heard that.

51:42.665 --> 51:45.225
That pork be callin' me, too.

51:45.334 --> 51:46.858
Let me tell you somethin'.

51:46.969 --> 51:49.802
Nation of Islam is more
than a pork-free diet.

51:49.906 --> 51:52.875
It is the word of Allah
as told to the Prophet Muhammad.

51:52.975 --> 51:55.341
Look, all I know
is I'm down with Jesus.

51:55.445 --> 51:58.608
Watch what you say
'cause I'm holdin' the clippers.

51:58.714 --> 52:01.012
- Change the subject.
- Exactly.

52:01.117 --> 52:02.744
I got a question.

52:02.852 --> 52:05.912
You don't find it odd,
as a black woman,

52:06.022 --> 52:08.547
to have a savior
who looks like Kenny G?

52:08.658 --> 52:10.216
- Kenny G?
- That's right.

52:10.326 --> 52:12.794
Now, his Christmas album
was tight.

52:12.895 --> 52:14.863
Look, Jesus is not white.

52:14.964 --> 52:17.125
He's Caublinasian,
like Tiger Woods.

52:17.233 --> 52:19.793
And you just about workin'
my last nerve.

52:19.902 --> 52:21.699
Pay Calvin.

52:22.572 --> 52:25.439
Speaking of Muslims,
is Ahmad Rashad Muslim?

52:25.541 --> 52:27.532
I don't ever see him wear
one of those bowties.

52:40.690 --> 52:42.248
Sorry. Did I wake you?

52:43.459 --> 52:45.120
Late night of creepin'?

52:45.928 --> 52:48.726
You don't know jack
about me, girl.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.725
You know what your problem is?

52:54.770 --> 52:57.898
<i>You know what one
of your problems is?</i>

52:58.007 --> 53:00.407
- You're bitter.
- I'm through, is what I am.

53:00.510 --> 53:05.038
That nice Terri routine?
Ain't nobody fallin' for that.

53:05.148 --> 53:08.242
A nice woman wouldn't
be doggin' my man Dinka.

53:08.351 --> 53:10.285
Dinka?
Ain't nobody doggin' him.

53:10.386 --> 53:12.445
That boy's in love with you, girl.

53:13.890 --> 53:16.381
But you don't want
a good man, right?

53:16.492 --> 53:18.084
What you want, a roughneck

53:18.194 --> 53:20.560
to cheat on you
and slap you around?

53:20.663 --> 53:22.563
- What about them bitches you roll with?
- Watch your mouth.

53:22.665 --> 53:23.996
All of them skanky as hell.

53:24.100 --> 53:27.092
"Ooh, I met Shaniqua
in the strip club last night. "

53:27.203 --> 53:28.534
Those are nice girls?

53:28.638 --> 53:30.731
- You don't know everything.
- I know enough.

53:30.840 --> 53:33.434
Hidin' behind some tattoos
and a prison record.

53:35.059 --> 53:36.890
- Grow up, be a real man.
- Why you even care?!

54:15.600 --> 54:17.192
Showyou what to do with this.

54:17.301 --> 54:19.667
Take this right up here,
put it on the door,

54:19.771 --> 54:21.705
twist it... pop!

54:21.806 --> 54:23.774
It'll put you in like Flynn.

54:23.875 --> 54:27.003
You know what else you could do?
You get a half pound of C-4,

54:27.111 --> 54:29.602
put a little timer on it...
tick, tick, tick, boom!

54:29.714 --> 54:32.979
Blow up the whole block.
I got some at the crib.

54:37.172 --> 54:38.161
What's goin' on?

54:40.341 --> 54:42.673
- No.
- What?

54:42.777 --> 54:44.904
- Don't even think about it.
- That's what I told 'em.

54:45.013 --> 54:47.004
I said the same thing.

54:47.115 --> 54:50.485
It's killin' me, man.
I just gotta know for myself.

54:50.551 --> 54:52.178
We not breakin' in
to Nappy Cutz.

54:52.287 --> 54:54.152
You want to know
what's in there.

54:54.255 --> 54:55.847
No. The answer's no.

54:56.824 --> 55:01.022
We're not breakin' in.
I will not allow it.

55:03.731 --> 55:04.857
Hurry up.

55:05.433 --> 55:08.163
Five minutes.
We in, we out.

55:08.269 --> 55:11.204
<i>This is like Ocean's Eleven.
This is my kind of stuff.</i>

55:11.306 --> 55:12.967
Check this out.

55:13.908 --> 55:16.274
- It's huge!
- Size isn't everything.

55:16.377 --> 55:17.571
Keep telling yourself that.

55:21.816 --> 55:23.078
Eddie, what you doin'?

55:23.184 --> 55:25.243
Didn't we come over here
to see it?

55:25.353 --> 55:26.980
I can't see diddly.

55:30.391 --> 55:34.088
This is the joint, B!
Look at this.

55:34.195 --> 55:37.323
I don't see no fish in the floor.
Where the fish at?

55:41.703 --> 55:43.603
That's crazy!

55:43.705 --> 55:45.070
What?

55:47.775 --> 55:49.709
You can say that again.

55:49.811 --> 55:51.836
- Goodness!
- What?

55:56.250 --> 55:58.115
You can't fry
none of that, though.

55:59.336 --> 56:01.566
You can play ball
up in here, man.

56:01.672 --> 56:03.833
No, you can play ball
down the street.

56:03.940 --> 56:07.307
Like a brother can't get a haircut
without trying to play some ball.

56:09.212 --> 56:11.009
<i>They got the Wall Street Journal.</i>

56:16.153 --> 56:17.381
Top of the line.

56:17.487 --> 56:20.183
This is what a barbershop's
supposed to look like.

56:20.290 --> 56:22.053
- This is leather.
- Word?

56:22.159 --> 56:23.922
- That's pleather.
- It's leather.

56:24.027 --> 56:25.187
It's ugly.

56:25.295 --> 56:30.028
Lookin' around, it's a nice shop,
but it don't have no character.

56:30.133 --> 56:31.225
Exactly.

56:31.335 --> 56:33.735
What we got across the street
is character.

56:33.837 --> 56:38.103
We got character,
we got conversation, and we got...

56:40.143 --> 56:41.701
We ain't got one of these.

56:43.013 --> 56:45.880
Lord have mercy!
This is pillow top!

56:47.984 --> 56:50.544
Come on, City Hall,
show me what you got.

56:52.122 --> 56:54.249
You're startin' to get on my nerves.

56:56.059 --> 56:58.391
<i>You're startin' to get on my nerves.</i>

57:00.263 --> 57:01.389
Let's crack it.

57:01.498 --> 57:04.365
I checked it already.
Let's crack it.

57:05.135 --> 57:06.261
You got me.

57:07.371 --> 57:08.804
Put the ball down.

57:16.913 --> 57:18.039
Oh, shit.

57:18.148 --> 57:19.445
Hey, y'all open?

57:19.549 --> 57:21.312
No, bro, we closed.

57:21.418 --> 57:24.012
Look at all the people.
Let me in.

57:24.121 --> 57:25.816
Hey, bro, we're closed.

57:25.922 --> 57:28.584
- Help a brother out.
- We goin' to jail.

57:28.692 --> 57:30.216
Two seconds, two seconds.

57:30.327 --> 57:32.921
- Just let him in, Big C.
- Don't let him in.

57:33.029 --> 57:35.463
- We can't leave him out there.
- Then let him in.

57:35.565 --> 57:37.658
I'm trying.
Kenard, let him in.

57:37.768 --> 57:40.566
Put that paper back up.

57:46.076 --> 57:48.101
Yes!
Hey, y'all!

57:49.513 --> 57:50.741
This place is nice!

57:50.847 --> 57:53.839
We closed. Go across the street
and get your hair cut.

57:53.950 --> 57:57.716
Kind of raggedy over there.
Just a quick touch-up.

57:57.821 --> 58:00.984
I'm flying back to L.A. Tonight.
How about it?

58:01.091 --> 58:03.958
- Who can do me?
- Not me, I got carpal tunnel.

58:04.060 --> 58:05.220
I got you.

58:05.328 --> 58:08.024
You got me? My man.

58:10.500 --> 58:14.368
We got Nappy Cutz on Crenshaw.
Love it.

58:14.471 --> 58:15.870
Everybody loves it.

58:15.972 --> 58:19.499
Hey, man,
get these clippers goin', player.

58:21.478 --> 58:23.207
These ain't supposed to be out yet.

58:23.313 --> 58:26.146
This is German-engineered,
titanium teeth,

58:26.249 --> 58:28.740
silent-whisper engine.
Listen.

58:30.287 --> 58:32.778
- King shit.
- They just clippers.

58:32.889 --> 58:34.857
This would double,
triple your business.

58:36.192 --> 58:38.558
You know what?
I'm gone. Have fun.

58:38.661 --> 58:39.821
Y'all hurry up.

58:39.929 --> 58:42.989
Don't steal nothin'
and don't break nothin'.

58:43.633 --> 58:46.193
Just close the back door
when you leave.

58:49.739 --> 58:53.175
Hey, Detective.
We was just lookin' for you.

58:53.276 --> 58:55.801
What the hell's going on here?

58:55.912 --> 58:57.379
We heard something...

58:57.480 --> 58:58.913
You broke into Nappy Cutz?

59:00.550 --> 59:01.574
- You take anything?
- No.

59:04.137 --> 59:05.570
- Damage anything?
- No.

59:06.372 --> 59:08.203
Kind of nice in there?

59:09.342 --> 59:10.809
No.

59:15.114 --> 59:18.083
Oh, man, they got
a basketball court!

59:21.954 --> 59:23.319
He's beautiful, isn't he?

59:26.059 --> 59:29.517
I just want him to have
everything I never had.

59:29.629 --> 59:32.462
I know you do.
And he will.

59:33.099 --> 59:35.761
So you coming to bed?

59:35.868 --> 59:37.130
Yeah.

59:43.676 --> 59:45.769
You tryin' to get
something started?

59:45.878 --> 59:47.311
I was hoping so,

59:47.413 --> 59:50.814
but you better catch me
before the rollers go in.

59:53.786 --> 59:56.311
Looks like you gonna have
a little brother or sister.

59:56.422 --> 59:59.255
Put them rollers in.
I might like that.

59:59.358 --> 01:00:02.987
I got contact lenses... blue, green,
bloodshot red... left ones only.

01:00:03.096 --> 01:00:04.461
Ray!

01:00:04.564 --> 01:00:07.499
Just the man I wanted to see.
Come back and talk to me.

01:00:09.735 --> 01:00:11.896
- I didn't know you was workin'.
- Come holler at me.

01:00:13.889 --> 01:00:15.686
How's life been treating you?

01:00:16.359 --> 01:00:17.587
It's been cool.

01:00:17.693 --> 01:00:19.752
Me and my girlfriend's husband
got in a fight.

01:00:19.862 --> 01:00:22.888
He only won
'cause she helped him.

01:00:22.999 --> 01:00:25.058
Good to see you.
Come on back.

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:26.896
- In the back-back?
- Yeah, in the back-back.

01:00:27.003 --> 01:00:29.233
With the scissors and everything?

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.307
How you been, Cal?

01:00:32.408 --> 01:00:33.340
You been going to church

01:00:35.061 --> 01:00:37.188
and living your life right
and everything?

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:40.924
- What you jumping for?
- I ain't know what you was comin' with.

01:00:41.033 --> 01:00:42.660
My nerves bad.
I'm light-skinned.

01:00:42.768 --> 01:00:44.668
Can you get this stuff
on this list?

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:48.035
I'm looking to get high-end stuff
at low-end prices.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:50.370
- You know I can.
- Legally.

01:00:50.476 --> 01:00:54.105
You mean like with a receipt legally?
Like I ain't steal it.

01:00:54.213 --> 01:00:57.376
If the police walk up,
do I gotta drop it and run?

01:00:57.483 --> 01:00:59.007
I can get anything you need.

01:00:59.118 --> 01:01:00.949
Nappy Cutz won't know
what hit 'em.

01:01:01.053 --> 01:01:02.816
This is not about Nappy Cutz.

01:01:02.922 --> 01:01:07.552
This is about personal enhancement,
personal growth.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:10.959
Expansion.
Not Nappy Cutz.

01:01:11.497 --> 01:01:14.591
Right.
They won't know what hit 'em.

01:01:32.251 --> 01:01:35.448
Come on over here
and get your hair cut.

01:01:35.554 --> 01:01:39.388
I'm working at Calvin Jr's.
Come be my first customer.

01:01:39.491 --> 01:01:41.152
What you mean, "Uh-uh"?

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.057
Can you hook me up with Isaac?

01:01:43.162 --> 01:01:45.187
The one with the "I"
cut in the back?

01:01:45.297 --> 01:01:49.427
You got a 'fro! You can't be gettin'
the "I" cut in the back.

01:01:49.535 --> 01:01:52.129
Condoleezza. With all that
White House money she makin',

01:01:52.238 --> 01:01:54.263
you'd think she could
afford herself a makeover.

01:01:54.373 --> 01:01:58.002
If I was in the White House,
I'd be fly all the time.

01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:01.204
If you was in the White House,
you'd be ghetto as hell.

01:02:01.313 --> 01:02:03.474
She'd have the president
all corn-rowed out,

01:02:03.582 --> 01:02:06.346
talking about,
"U.S., fool. U.S., fool. "

01:02:06.452 --> 01:02:07.749
The president would be a thug.

01:02:07.853 --> 01:02:10.117
She think a head of state's
a sexual position.

01:02:10.222 --> 01:02:12.884
"I'm inviting heads of state today. "

01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:17.459
Oh, my God.

01:02:17.997 --> 01:02:19.259
Please stop.

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:27.299
Gina, do I look like Beyoncé?

01:02:30.342 --> 01:02:31.366
Just like her.

01:02:31.477 --> 01:02:34.310
I knew you was gonna say that.
Give me some.

01:02:35.147 --> 01:02:37.672
This is like the world
coming together,

01:02:37.783 --> 01:02:40.581
like all the gangs
coming together.

01:02:40.686 --> 01:02:43.382
There's beauty in there.
You gotta love it, man.

01:02:43.489 --> 01:02:45.684
This came
from my grandmama church.

01:02:45.791 --> 01:02:47.759
They might want that back.

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:51.023
Who's been chewing on this thing?
It look like Holyfield's ear.

01:02:51.897 --> 01:02:53.023
Picture and picture.

01:02:53.132 --> 01:02:57.501
This one get channels 2 through 5,
and this one get 9 through 13.

01:02:57.603 --> 01:02:59.503
Give me the big one.

01:02:59.605 --> 01:03:02.904
Take the little one, too.
You got to take the little one.

01:03:03.008 --> 01:03:06.535
- You keep it.
- Cal, you gotta get this little one.

01:03:06.645 --> 01:03:08.044
Come on, Cal!

01:03:08.147 --> 01:03:10.138
Thought I'd add
a little style to the place.

01:03:12.384 --> 01:03:14.784
That's that Picassio stuff
right there.

01:03:14.887 --> 01:03:16.821
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:16.922 --> 01:03:18.617
Beautiful.

01:03:20.025 --> 01:03:21.492
What is it, a uterus?

01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:27.263
Calvin, I hooked you up
with the alderman.

01:03:27.366 --> 01:03:29.493
What'd you do,
get me some handicapped plates?

01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:32.331
Better. You're gonna be
on the news.

01:03:32.438 --> 01:03:33.530
The news?

01:03:33.639 --> 01:03:35.903
The alderman's taking
a walking tour of the block

01:03:36.008 --> 01:03:36.906
before Friday's
city council meeting

01:03:38.326 --> 01:03:40.521
to let the constituency know
that he's concerned.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:44.328
Concerned?
About November, right?

01:03:44.432 --> 01:03:47.401
I talked him into
talking to you... good publicity.

01:03:47.502 --> 01:03:49.993
- You could've asked me first.
- I know.

01:03:50.105 --> 01:03:52.630
But it was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:55.733
We don't do politics in here.
It's a place of business.

01:03:55.844 --> 01:03:57.402
This ain't no community center.

01:03:57.512 --> 01:03:58.638
You know what?

01:03:58.747 --> 01:04:02.114
You sound just like
your daddy right now.

01:04:02.217 --> 01:04:05.015
We will not be silenced.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.452
When the FBI
gassed the Black Panthers out,

01:04:09.607 --> 01:04:10.801
we found a place
to be today.

01:04:11.642 --> 01:04:13.769
Thank you, Brother Calvin.

01:04:13.877 --> 01:04:15.242
Brother Calvin!

01:04:15.346 --> 01:04:18.577
We will continue to provide
books and classes,

01:04:18.682 --> 01:04:21.378
food and clothing
through our outreach program.

01:04:21.485 --> 01:04:22.611
That's right, brother.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.280
And when the pigs show up,
they're gonna show up with guns.

01:04:25.389 --> 01:04:28.517
<i>We ain't gonna do nothin'
but show up with our guns!</i>

01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:32.322
Then they gonna start shootin'.
Then we gonna start shootin'!

01:04:32.429 --> 01:04:33.760
That's right, brother!

01:04:33.864 --> 01:04:37.129
I'm tellin' you, every last
one of them's gonna get shot!

01:04:37.234 --> 01:04:38.758
That's right.

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:41.337
Then all of us
is gonna get shot!

01:04:42.206 --> 01:04:43.969
And all of us
is gonna die together!

01:04:46.744 --> 01:04:48.803
Let's make it happen!

01:04:48.912 --> 01:04:50.174
Black power!

01:04:50.381 --> 01:04:51.780
Black power!

01:04:51.882 --> 01:04:53.645
Black power! Yeah!

01:04:53.751 --> 01:04:56.276
Black power!
That's us! Black power!

01:04:56.387 --> 01:04:57.581
Power to the people!

01:04:58.789 --> 01:05:01.189
Shit, man, them fools crazy.

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:04.185
Well, if it ain't Lalowe Sharpton.

01:05:05.496 --> 01:05:07.157
My goodness, my goodness.

01:05:08.365 --> 01:05:10.526
The barbershop.
How you doin'? Lalowe Brown.

01:05:10.634 --> 01:05:11.862
Checker Fred, sir.

01:05:11.969 --> 01:05:13.960
How you doin', Checker?

01:05:14.071 --> 01:05:16.232
Lalowe Brown.
Good to see you.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.637
How you doin', sir?

01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:21.370
My, my.
Well, well, look at this.

01:05:21.478 --> 01:05:23.673
Look what we got...
we got a lady barber.

01:05:23.781 --> 01:05:26.944
We didn't have this
back in the day.

01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:28.517
- What's your name?
- Terri.

01:05:28.619 --> 01:05:30.450
- Sarah?
- Terri.

01:05:32.322 --> 01:05:35.223
Lalowe's gonna have to come back
and let you give me a little trim.

01:05:35.325 --> 01:05:37.190
- Trim?
- A haircut.

01:05:37.294 --> 01:05:40.354
Terri, if you wanna be down,

01:05:40.464 --> 01:05:42.864
vote Lalowe Brown.

01:05:43.066 --> 01:05:44.590
You remember that.

01:05:46.837 --> 01:05:49.362
This is Calvin's Barbershop.

01:05:49.473 --> 01:05:52.636
This is a cornerstone
of the black community

01:05:52.743 --> 01:05:54.574
for some 40-odd years.

01:05:54.678 --> 01:05:57.078
I've been coming down here
many a Saturday afternoon,

01:05:57.181 --> 01:05:58.978
get myself straight
for Sunday morning.

01:05:59.082 --> 01:06:01.812
But I wanna introduce you
to the man himself,

01:06:01.919 --> 01:06:05.616
the man who quantifies
and epitomizes

01:06:05.722 --> 01:06:09.658
the institutional possibilities
of black hair.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.527
He is a potentiating progenitor
in all kinds of fine ways.

01:06:14.631 --> 01:06:18.590
He's my fine friend,
this brother right here, Calvin.

01:06:18.702 --> 01:06:20.260
How you doin'?
Calvin Palmer.

01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.895
- How you doin', son?
- All right.

01:06:23.006 --> 01:06:26.373
Calvin, you are a pillar
of this fine community.

01:06:26.477 --> 01:06:28.411
How is everything going for you

01:06:28.512 --> 01:06:31.072
with all this social change
happening down here?

01:06:31.181 --> 01:06:34.548
Well, Mr. Brown, as you know,
there is a lot of change...

01:06:34.651 --> 01:06:37.279
There is a lot of change,

01:06:37.387 --> 01:06:39.287
and change
is hard sometimes, right?

01:06:39.389 --> 01:06:43.689
But if we want to stand
together as a community,

01:06:43.794 --> 01:06:46.592
- we will find a way to survive.
- Tell it!

01:06:46.697 --> 01:06:47.891
- Tell it, Lo.
- That's right.

01:06:47.998 --> 01:06:50.762
You let Lalowe lay it down for you.

01:06:50.868 --> 01:06:52.768
If you wanna stay afloat,

01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.269
we got to...

01:06:56.507 --> 01:06:58.737
...you gonna have to
rock the boat.

01:06:58.842 --> 01:07:02.835
<i>Because if they want
to send us packin',</i>

01:07:02.946 --> 01:07:04.413
baby, it's on and crackin'!

01:07:04.515 --> 01:07:07.040
And if they try to mess
with this brother,

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:09.778
then it's gonna be on
like a mother!

01:07:11.088 --> 01:07:12.817
That's a little rough.

01:07:12.923 --> 01:07:15.983
If you want to stay around,
y'all know what you gotta do.

01:07:16.093 --> 01:07:18.425
Vote for Lalowe Brown!

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:23.488
Hey, Calvin, why don't you
get me a little shape-up?

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.591
'Cause I've been running around.

01:07:25.702 --> 01:07:27.932
- You got a chair for me?
- Yeah, right here.

01:07:28.038 --> 01:07:31.701
Of course we got one for you.
Kenard! Kenard!

01:07:32.576 --> 01:07:35.340
- Let Kenard cut your hair.
- Hold on, hold on.

01:07:35.445 --> 01:07:37.436
Wait a minute. No.

01:07:37.548 --> 01:07:40.711
Get on over there, Get-low.
Sit right on down, So-low.

01:07:40.817 --> 01:07:42.808
Nice to meet you.
How you doin'?

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.821
- Wait a minute.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:45.923 --> 01:07:47.982
It's okay. It's okay.

01:07:48.559 --> 01:07:52.620
Kenard here is one
of our prima donna barbers.

01:07:52.729 --> 01:07:53.753
Front chair.

01:07:53.864 --> 01:07:57.732
You ain't had
your hair cut till...

01:07:57.834 --> 01:07:59.199
- Kenard.
- Yeah.

01:07:59.303 --> 01:08:03.239
- Yeah. Let's take a picture.
- Thank you, brother.

01:08:06.176 --> 01:08:09.373
Yeah, okay. All right.
Enjoy yourself, Low-below.

01:08:09.479 --> 01:08:11.777
You just relax, Down-low.

01:08:11.882 --> 01:08:13.747
We on TV, man.

01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:17.581
I know. This is must-see TV.
It's gonna be good.

01:08:18.822 --> 01:08:21.290
This is why
I love this community,

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:25.054
'cause there's a historical context
for every action that takes place here.

01:08:25.162 --> 01:08:27.153
I plan to die here.

01:08:27.264 --> 01:08:29.960
We're running short on time.
If we could speed this up?

01:08:30.067 --> 01:08:32.558
You can't rush the best, Jimmy.

01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:35.569
- He ain't the best.
- He ain't ask you, man.

01:08:37.006 --> 01:08:39.840
Well, who's the best, then,
youngblood?

01:08:40.978 --> 01:08:44.709
- You the best?
- No doubt. Isaac Rosenberg.

01:08:44.814 --> 01:08:47.545
The best barber
in the state of Illinois.

01:08:47.651 --> 01:08:49.743
The best barber
on this rock we call Earth.

01:08:49.853 --> 01:08:51.343
Come on down to Cal's.

01:08:51.455 --> 01:08:53.184
Our rainbow coalition right here.

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.384
Yeah, this is integration
right here.

01:08:56.493 --> 01:08:57.892
What's up, Ma? Richie?

01:08:57.995 --> 01:09:00.054
You're feelin' yourself
way too much.

01:09:00.162 --> 01:09:01.823
Don't sweat the technique.

01:09:01.932 --> 01:09:04.526
What technique?
You cut like a bitch.

01:09:04.635 --> 01:09:06.761
Carvin' I's in the back
of people's head?

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:09.270
- Your skills is limited.
- My skills are limited?

01:09:09.372 --> 01:09:11.705
- Where your skills at?
- This ain't the time.

01:09:11.808 --> 01:09:14.935
Ain't in cuttin' hair.
Must be slobbin' Terri in the locker room.

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:17.640
What? No.

01:09:19.883 --> 01:09:23.546
You ain't supposed to air our
dirty laundry like that. We on TV.

01:09:23.654 --> 01:09:26.020
- What is he talking about?
- Dinka, it wasn't like that.

01:09:26.122 --> 01:09:28.216
...of populist politics.

01:09:28.325 --> 01:09:31.260
- Thug love! Thug love!
- It was not like that.

01:09:31.361 --> 01:09:33.761
Everybody's hatin' on me.
'Cause I'm competent?

01:09:33.863 --> 01:09:36.196
- You don't make this shop.
- I have lately.

01:09:36.299 --> 01:09:40.234
I will confront all of those
forces that are trying to change,

01:09:40.337 --> 01:09:42.395
that are trying
to make things happen.

01:09:42.506 --> 01:09:45.202
They don't treat barbers
like this at Nappy Cutz.

01:09:45.308 --> 01:09:47.242
Why don't you go find out?

01:09:47.344 --> 01:09:50.040
You on that bullshit.
Go find out.

01:09:50.147 --> 01:09:53.241
We don't need you around here
if you don't wanna be here.

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:54.942
Fine, man.

01:09:56.053 --> 01:09:58.248
All right.
Get out of the chair, man.

01:09:58.355 --> 01:09:59.287
No, you stay here.

01:10:00.707 --> 01:10:04.643
In November, I plan to establish
this barbershop as my headquarters.

01:10:04.745 --> 01:10:07.805
At Calvin's Barbershop,
we're gonna make this institution

01:10:07.914 --> 01:10:11.509
one of the leading institutions,
like a torpedo moving towards the future.

01:10:11.618 --> 01:10:13.245
Yes, indeed. All right.

01:10:13.353 --> 01:10:15.787
Kenard, just a little off the top.

01:10:15.889 --> 01:10:18.551
I really think it's time
for us to move along.

01:10:18.659 --> 01:10:21.150
Come on, Jimmy,
just two seconds.

01:10:27.668 --> 01:10:30.466
My bad, brother.
I skipped you.

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:32.868
Why don't you just let me
fade you up?

01:10:32.973 --> 01:10:35.066
- How about a nice Quo Vadis?
- What'd you do to my head?

01:10:36.793 --> 01:10:38.454
- Don't even look at that.
- Is that my head?

01:10:38.561 --> 01:10:42.463
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

01:10:42.565 --> 01:10:44.192
You a grown man!

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.064
You don't do that to Kenard!

01:10:47.169 --> 01:10:49.000
Get out of here!

01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:59.579
<i>And far from its roots
as a family establishment,</i>

01:10:59.682 --> 01:11:01.843
<i>this was the scene today
at 79th and Exchange</i>

01:11:01.951 --> 01:11:05.352
<i>at Calvin's Barbershop when
Alderman Lalowe Brown stopped by</i>

01:11:05.454 --> 01:11:07.684
<i>for a photo opportunity
and haircut.</i>

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:09.348
<i>Or shall I say scalping?</i>

01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:13.053
<i>Needless to say, I doubt
very seriously if the alderman</i>

01:11:13.162 --> 01:11:16.029
<i>will be frequenting
Calvin's Barbershop anytime soon.</i>

01:11:18.768 --> 01:11:20.167
Nice.

01:11:35.451 --> 01:11:37.783
- Who is it?
- It's Rick.

01:11:37.887 --> 01:11:39.320
What do you want?

01:11:39.422 --> 01:11:41.720
I wanna talk to you.
I feel bad.

01:11:41.824 --> 01:11:43.257
Good. I'm busy.

01:11:43.359 --> 01:11:45.554
Open the door.
We gotta talk about this.

01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:49.028
- There's nothing to discuss.
- Dinka, I messed up.

01:11:50.099 --> 01:11:53.865
What happened
between me and Terri was foul.

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:57.201
It should have never happened.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:11:59.275 --> 01:12:00.606
I'm sorry.

01:12:03.094 --> 01:12:05.062
Apology accepted.

01:12:05.163 --> 01:12:07.688
Can we discuss this tomorrow?

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.530
You remember Shawna, right?

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:12.696
Hi.

01:12:13.738 --> 01:12:14.864
What's up, Shawna?

01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:18.600
Handle that.

01:12:19.144 --> 01:12:20.611
I'll get at you tomorrow.

01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:22.509
Maybe the day after.

01:13:15.949 --> 01:13:18.008
You should see her
when I'm drinkin'.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.851
'Cause I know her.

01:13:24.158 --> 01:13:26.319
Exactly right, exactly right.

01:13:31.165 --> 01:13:32.860
What are you doing here?

01:13:32.966 --> 01:13:35.264
The question is,
what you doin' here?

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:37.929
Look a little shady to me.

01:13:38.572 --> 01:13:40.335
You come up to my shop today

01:13:40.441 --> 01:13:42.602
and got the nerve
to be huddled up with this shark.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:46.703
Don't come in here accusing me
of some malicious and egregious act

01:13:46.814 --> 01:13:48.975
when what you should be doin'
is apologizing

01:13:49.083 --> 01:13:51.677
for making me look
like a goddamn fool today.

01:13:51.785 --> 01:13:54.345
- That's what you should be doing.
- Lalowe.

01:13:57.424 --> 01:13:59.187
Ease up. It's cool.

01:14:00.527 --> 01:14:02.495
All right there, youngblood.

01:14:03.664 --> 01:14:07.100
Ain't nothin' going on in here,
just business.

01:14:07.868 --> 01:14:09.961
- I'll bet.
- It's true.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:13.062
In fact, the alderman and I
were just talking about you.

01:14:13.173 --> 01:14:14.538
Well, about your business.

01:14:15.175 --> 01:14:18.372
I undervalued the importance
of your shop to this community.

01:14:18.479 --> 01:14:20.140
That's my bad.

01:14:20.881 --> 01:14:23.076
It'd be a shame to see it
all go away for naught.

01:14:23.183 --> 01:14:26.277
Man, I'm from the South Side.

01:14:26.386 --> 01:14:27.375
- Don't try to hustle me.
- No hustle.

01:14:28.739 --> 01:14:31.333
A hustle implies one side wins,
the other side loses.

01:14:31.441 --> 01:14:33.432
I'm proposing a win-win.

01:14:33.543 --> 01:14:36.706
I'm proposing that Nappy Cutz
never sees the light of day.

01:14:38.248 --> 01:14:41.513
- Is that right?
- I'll turn it into a nightclub.

01:14:41.618 --> 01:14:44.018
Your barbershop
will continue to thrive

01:14:44.121 --> 01:14:48.023
without any interference from me
or from anyone else.

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:50.218
And this miracle happens
if I do what?

01:14:50.327 --> 01:14:52.557
Not tell people
what I saw here tonight?

01:14:54.831 --> 01:14:56.526
What'd you see tonight?

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.000
What'd you see in here
tonight, Calvin? Nothing.

01:15:01.104 --> 01:15:02.594
Nothing.

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:05.568
Have a seat.

01:15:08.979 --> 01:15:10.537
No, I'd rather stand.

01:15:11.248 --> 01:15:13.216
All you have to do is talk.

01:15:14.584 --> 01:15:17.075
The city council meeting
is tomorrow.

01:15:17.187 --> 01:15:21.351
We need those other
business owners on your block to sell.

01:15:21.458 --> 01:15:23.323
If you were to express to them

01:15:23.426 --> 01:15:26.452
and to the governing board that you
believe in Quality Land's proposal,

01:15:26.563 --> 01:15:29.760
your voice could be
the determining factor.

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.961
At least, I think so.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:41.142
This could be a shitload of money
for the whole district.

01:15:41.244 --> 01:15:43.838
Not to mention, it could be
a nice little windfall for Calvin.

01:15:45.282 --> 01:15:46.214
A $200,000 windfall.

01:15:50.202 --> 01:15:53.069
Now, that's a nice piece
of pocket change.

01:15:53.172 --> 01:15:57.768
You could take your wife
on down to Jamaica.

01:15:57.877 --> 01:16:00.437
The real one,
not that one in Queens.

01:16:00.546 --> 01:16:03.310
It'd be a nice kick-start
to your kid's college fund.

01:16:03.416 --> 01:16:05.509
You have a son, don't you?

01:16:06.585 --> 01:16:08.450
Yeah, I got a son.

01:16:11.557 --> 01:16:13.855
All you gotta do is talk.

01:16:16.429 --> 01:16:18.021
$200,000.

01:16:18.998 --> 01:16:22.092
I'm not asking you
for a whole lot, just to...

01:16:22.201 --> 01:16:23.998
come on down and...

01:16:26.672 --> 01:16:28.196
...just talk.

01:16:28.307 --> 01:16:30.741
Just talk.

01:16:39.985 --> 01:16:41.213
All right.

01:16:42.955 --> 01:16:44.513
See you tomorrow.

01:16:50.396 --> 01:16:51.886
Win-win.

01:17:17.139 --> 01:17:18.071
You stalking me?

01:17:18.174 --> 01:17:20.540
- Just wanna talk.
- Ain't nothin' to say.

01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:27.146
Let me drive you to work.

01:17:27.249 --> 01:17:30.582
How am I gonna look
rollin' up in your freak-mobile?

01:17:30.686 --> 01:17:34.315
Terri, we work together.
We need to have a conversation.

01:17:35.024 --> 01:17:36.548
Listen to what I got to say.

01:17:36.659 --> 01:17:39.958
After that, you ain't got to
speak to me ever again.

01:17:42.531 --> 01:17:45.056
I'll drop you off around the corner.

01:17:46.368 --> 01:17:47.892
Get in the car.

01:17:49.205 --> 01:17:50.638
Please.

01:17:55.578 --> 01:17:58.012
Terri, I really ain't
been myself lately.

01:17:58.114 --> 01:18:02.483
Ricky, before you even say anything,
I need you to know

01:18:02.585 --> 01:18:05.019
that thug-gangta-player
bullshit is over for me.

01:18:05.121 --> 01:18:05.712
I'm done with that in my life.

01:18:07.522 --> 01:18:10.150
But you don't even know me,
what I'm about.

01:18:10.258 --> 01:18:11.816
I see you every day...

01:18:11.926 --> 01:18:14.360
late, sleepin'
in the locker room,

01:18:14.462 --> 01:18:15.861
runnin' ho's day and night.

01:18:15.964 --> 01:18:18.228
How is that not knowing you?

01:18:19.133 --> 01:18:20.100
Boy!

01:18:21.569 --> 01:18:22.399
I'm just gettin'
my backpack. Relax.

01:18:26.573 --> 01:18:28.598
What is this, a warrant?

01:18:44.558 --> 01:18:46.025
Why didn't you say anything?

01:18:46.126 --> 01:18:49.118
I couldn't tell nobody I was
studying for the fuckin' GED.

01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:50.423
It's embarrassing.

01:18:51.298 --> 01:18:52.595
But you passed.

01:18:54.101 --> 01:18:55.068
Yeah.

01:18:57.137 --> 01:19:00.698
Yeah, but honestly, though,
Now that I got it,

01:19:00.808 --> 01:19:03.299
I don't even know what it means.

01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:05.571
It means you give a damn
about your life.

01:19:07.347 --> 01:19:08.609
You should be proud.

01:19:10.651 --> 01:19:12.585
I'm proud of you.

01:19:14.388 --> 01:19:17.050
Don't start paying me
compliments and stuff,

01:19:17.157 --> 01:19:19.125
'cause then I gotta
give one back to you.

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:23.887
We'd be all over each other again,
and don't nobody want that.

01:19:23.997 --> 01:19:25.123
I don't want it.

01:19:33.373 --> 01:19:34.965
For the record...

01:19:37.344 --> 01:19:41.440
I kind of liked the old Terri
before all the changes.

01:19:41.548 --> 01:19:44.073
Loud and angry all the time?

01:19:44.184 --> 01:19:45.310
Real.

01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:48.683
All the time.

01:20:06.306 --> 01:20:08.137
Man, I hope you hittin' that!

01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:12.144
Miss Emma, is somethin' wrong?

01:20:12.246 --> 01:20:15.943
Nothing a little prayer
can't handle, or my pistol.

01:20:16.049 --> 01:20:17.346
What's the matter?

01:20:17.451 --> 01:20:21.410
They wanna make this
funky little place into a co-op.

01:20:21.522 --> 01:20:22.887
What?

01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:26.425
I can't afford that down payment.
I'm gonna have to move.

01:20:26.527 --> 01:20:28.791
Don't you own this place?

01:20:28.896 --> 01:20:30.989
Just because I don't own it
don't mean it's not mine.

01:20:37.287 --> 01:20:39.346
You've been livin' here, like, what?

01:20:39.456 --> 01:20:43.586
A long time, long enough
to wipe your nasty little butt.

01:20:43.693 --> 01:20:46.253
And a whole lot
of others, too.

01:20:46.362 --> 01:20:47.124
But it's been worth it, though.

01:20:49.649 --> 01:20:51.844
We can't lose you, Miss Emma.

01:20:51.952 --> 01:20:55.581
It's about time
for me to retire anyway.

01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:58.886
My brother has a nice place
out in Arizona.

01:20:58.992 --> 01:21:00.391
You ever been to Arizona?

01:21:00.494 --> 01:21:04.726
Hot as hell,
but I got some nice hats.

01:21:05.732 --> 01:21:07.859
How can you leave Chicago?

01:21:07.968 --> 01:21:09.697
On the bus.

01:21:09.803 --> 01:21:12.101
Same way I got here.

01:21:23.416 --> 01:21:25.247
Good morning there, youngblood.

01:21:25.352 --> 01:21:28.412
You up early.
They fumigating your crib again?

01:21:28.522 --> 01:21:32.322
I thought it'd be a good day
to walk and see the trees and dew.

01:21:32.425 --> 01:21:33.858
Yeah, they fumigating.

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.828
I had a cockroach in my house
so big, I thought it was Shaq.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.428
You're crazy.

01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:44.828
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

01:21:46.656 --> 01:21:48.783
You done worked and lived
around here for what, 34, 35 years?

01:21:48.891 --> 01:21:52.657
Yeah, I guess 30 and some change.

01:21:52.762 --> 01:21:54.525
I ain't tryin' to clown, but...

01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:59.829
I hope not. You know I got jokes.
Don't you start nothin'.

01:21:59.935 --> 01:22:02.495
Let me ask you...
is this the life you wanted?

01:22:03.739 --> 01:22:05.798
Or did you ever think
you could do better?

01:22:06.876 --> 01:22:10.835
What the hell keeps you
comin' back here every day?

01:22:10.946 --> 01:22:14.712
Well, Calvin, you know,
if I was a bettin' man,

01:22:14.817 --> 01:22:18.184
I'd say the reason I come back in
day in and day out

01:22:18.287 --> 01:22:21.381
is the free chair.

01:22:24.193 --> 01:22:25.353
Get real.

01:22:29.565 --> 01:22:31.465
Hold it!
Get off him, pig!

01:22:31.567 --> 01:22:35.230
<i>...some very sad news
for all of you,</i>

01:22:35.337 --> 01:22:39.398
<i>and that is that Martin Luther King
was shot and was killed tonight</i>

01:22:39.508 --> 01:22:41.373
<i>in Memphis, Tennessee.</i>

01:22:41.477 --> 01:22:44.469
<i>In this difficult day,</i>

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.844
<i>in this difficult time
for the United States,</i>

01:22:46.949 --> 01:22:50.441
<i>it's perhaps well to ask
what kind of a nation we are...</i>

01:22:50.553 --> 01:22:52.248
This ain't right.

01:22:52.922 --> 01:22:55.891
We should be honoring the man's
memory, we shouldn't be doing this.

01:22:55.991 --> 01:22:58.551
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

01:23:00.362 --> 01:23:04.389
I'm gonna get on out of here.
I need to go check on Loretta.

01:23:05.034 --> 01:23:07.229
She's talking about
moving back to Georgia.

01:23:07.336 --> 01:23:11.238
<i>I would only say
that I can also feel in my own heart</i>

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:13.501
<i>the same kind of feeling.</i>

01:23:13.609 --> 01:23:15.975
<i>I had a member
of my family killed.</i>

01:23:17.213 --> 01:23:19.204
<i>But he was killed
by a white man.</i>

01:23:19.315 --> 01:23:22.216
<i>What we need
in the United States...</i>

01:23:26.121 --> 01:23:28.055
You be safe out there.

01:23:28.157 --> 01:23:31.092
Yeah, I will, man.
Don't worry about me.

01:23:31.193 --> 01:23:33.525
I'll probably
stop by Montgomery Ward's,

01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:35.995
pick up a TV,
washer and dryer, lamps.

01:23:36.098 --> 01:23:37.395
You need anything?

01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:43.570
- Move, Eddie!
- No!

01:23:43.672 --> 01:23:45.765
- Eddie, get out of there!
- No!

01:23:46.342 --> 01:23:47.309
No!

01:24:00.489 --> 01:24:02.480
I'll stay a little while longer, man.

01:24:08.497 --> 01:24:11.193
Yeah, so after all that
quieted down,

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.633
your daddy told me I ain't never
have to pay for my chair again.

01:24:15.437 --> 01:24:18.099
That's the kind of man
your father was.

01:24:18.207 --> 01:24:20.232
He was a man's man.

01:24:20.342 --> 01:24:22.537
He used to always
call me a hero.

01:24:23.579 --> 01:24:27.071
The funny thing is
I never saw it that way.

01:24:27.182 --> 01:24:30.345
I didn't save the shop, Calvin.
The shop saved me.

01:24:30.452 --> 01:24:32.920
A lot like it did for Ricky.

01:24:33.022 --> 01:24:35.786
I ain't have no life before this.

01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:39.957
As far as I'm concerned,
my life began

01:24:40.062 --> 01:24:43.793
on July 4, 1967,
when I came through that back door

01:24:43.899 --> 01:24:45.992
and your father gave
my black ass a break.

01:24:46.101 --> 01:24:49.798
So I'd be sad if somethin'
was to ever happen to this place.

01:24:51.473 --> 01:24:52.167
But I'd be all right, though.

01:24:53.592 --> 01:24:55.924
Oh, yeah, Eddie be fine.

01:24:57.496 --> 01:24:58.724
Hey, what's up, y'all?

01:24:58.831 --> 01:25:01.527
Calvin, can I have a word
with you for a second?

01:25:01.634 --> 01:25:02.828
What you want, man?

01:25:02.935 --> 01:25:05.995
Well, I know these are
tough times for you, cuz.

01:25:06.105 --> 01:25:10.872
It's times like these when men
must rise up and make the right choice.

01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:13.843
- Is that right?
- Yeah. It's about the truth.

01:25:13.946 --> 01:25:16.642
Each and every one of us
has our own truth,

01:25:16.749 --> 01:25:21.049
a truth that we must live with
for the rest of our lives.

01:25:21.887 --> 01:25:23.320
Is there a point to this?

01:25:23.422 --> 01:25:25.287
My truth is across the street.

01:25:25.391 --> 01:25:29.088
I appreciate the job, cuz.
I'll always love you for it.

01:25:29.194 --> 01:25:30.456
But I gotta bounce.

01:25:30.563 --> 01:25:34.158
Y'all goin' broke
around this mug. Boy, I swear.

01:25:37.303 --> 01:25:38.497
All right, all right.

01:25:38.604 --> 01:25:41.596
And if anybody wanna come over
anytime and hoop it up,

01:25:41.707 --> 01:25:43.937
ring a player, you know?

01:25:48.897 --> 01:25:50.364
All this silence
got my gut grumblin'.

01:25:50.465 --> 01:25:52.626
I'm gonna run down to Berry's,
get me a pastrami and fries.

01:25:52.734 --> 01:25:57.068
Eddie, a man at your age
should be watching what he eats.

01:25:57.171 --> 01:25:59.935
If you don't knock the fork
out of my hand,

01:26:00.041 --> 01:26:02.407
I won't knock the spear
out of yours, okay, Somalia?

01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:06.947
Eddie, get me that chicken tamale
and strawberry shake special.

01:26:07.048 --> 01:26:09.380
Get old Checkers a ham and cheese
on some honky bread,

01:26:09.484 --> 01:26:11.418
mustard, hold the mayo.

01:26:11.519 --> 01:26:13.646
Get me a Mountain Dew
and chopped salad.

01:26:13.755 --> 01:26:16.747
I'll take some chili fries,
onion rings,

01:26:16.858 --> 01:26:18.723
and a pot pie with egg on it.

01:26:18.826 --> 01:26:23.354
Okay, that's gonna be
three orders of "Hell, no"

01:26:23.464 --> 01:26:25.591
and two sides
of "Ask your mama"

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:29.500
and a large cup
of "Negro, please. "

01:26:29.604 --> 01:26:30.969
Grumpy old man.

01:26:33.107 --> 01:26:34.870
Hey, Big C, where you headed?

01:26:34.976 --> 01:26:37.809
Nowhere.
Just got a little business to handle.

01:26:37.912 --> 01:26:39.140
I'll be back.

01:27:08.993 --> 01:27:10.688
And when they build all this stuff,

01:27:10.795 --> 01:27:12.729
they make it totally unaffordable

01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:15.526
for the people
who live here to stay here.

01:27:17.652 --> 01:27:19.847
Now, we're South Side people
with South Side money,

01:27:19.954 --> 01:27:21.182
and that ain't much.

01:27:21.288 --> 01:27:26.453
So I'm against the proposed
Quality Land development project

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.688
on 79th and Exchange.

01:27:33.667 --> 01:27:34.793
You tell it, sister!

01:27:34.902 --> 01:27:37.302
That's right!
Very good!

01:27:37.405 --> 01:27:38.599
That's right!

01:27:38.706 --> 01:27:40.606
Quiet. Okay.

01:27:41.509 --> 01:27:44.171
Before we adjourn
and make our decision,

01:27:44.278 --> 01:27:49.181
is there anyone else who'd like
to be heard on this matter?

01:27:51.952 --> 01:27:53.579
Let's get this thing over with.

01:27:54.822 --> 01:27:56.687
I'd like to say somethin'.

01:27:58.793 --> 01:27:59.851
Sir.

01:28:10.204 --> 01:28:12.729
- What's he gonna say?
- Shut up. Shut up.

01:28:18.078 --> 01:28:19.545
A little nervous.

01:28:22.383 --> 01:28:25.614
I haven't felt like this
since I met my wife's pops.

01:28:32.226 --> 01:28:34.251
My name is Calvin Palmer.

01:28:34.361 --> 01:28:37.524
I own Calvin's Barbershop
over on 79th.

01:28:37.631 --> 01:28:40.361
Been there since 1958.

01:28:41.202 --> 01:28:45.901
And all I'd like to say
is that all change isn't bad.

01:28:46.006 --> 01:28:47.803
Who can argue with progress?

01:28:48.676 --> 01:28:51.509
Better schools, cleaner streets...

01:28:51.612 --> 01:28:54.342
something we need
on the South Side.

01:28:54.448 --> 01:28:56.780
And I want the best for my son

01:28:56.884 --> 01:29:00.285
just like my parents
wanted the best for me.

01:29:00.387 --> 01:29:02.912
So some change on 79th

01:29:03.023 --> 01:29:05.753
is well-needed
and well-deserved.

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.918
Oh, yeah.

01:29:08.863 --> 01:29:12.230
Also, I'm happy that people
outside our community

01:29:12.333 --> 01:29:16.531
are starting to find the value
in our neighborhoods.

01:29:16.637 --> 01:29:18.628
But...

01:29:18.739 --> 01:29:22.368
if that means selling our soul
just to make a quick buck,

01:29:22.476 --> 01:29:24.603
I ain't with that shit.

01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:30.949
It's not worth it.

01:29:31.519 --> 01:29:34.920
That's why I'm not sellin' out...

01:29:37.758 --> 01:29:39.749
...like some people I know.

01:29:47.685 --> 01:29:50.017
Sir, do you know
why Jesus wept?

01:29:53.391 --> 01:29:55.325
No. No, I don't.

01:29:55.426 --> 01:30:00.363
Well, when Lazarus died,

01:30:00.465 --> 01:30:04.424
Martha and Mary,
they cried over his body.

01:30:04.536 --> 01:30:06.561
When Jesus sawtheir pain,

01:30:06.671 --> 01:30:08.730
he couldn't help but cry, too.

01:30:09.874 --> 01:30:11.535
So that's why Jesus wept.

01:30:13.645 --> 01:30:17.274
That's how I feel when I look
at people like Hank Tolliver

01:30:17.382 --> 01:30:19.782
and Gertrude Rose

01:30:19.884 --> 01:30:23.047
and Miss Emma
bein' driven out...

01:30:24.355 --> 01:30:28.485
...'cause they don't fit the plan
of the new developers.

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:33.558
We gotta realize that people
make this community,

01:30:33.665 --> 01:30:36.862
not $5 coffees
and $20 mugs.

01:30:36.968 --> 01:30:38.458
It's the people.

01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:42.768
And once you lose the people,
you lose the neighborhood.

01:30:42.874 --> 01:30:45.399
So if I had to say,
I would deny

01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:50.447
Quality Land Development's
proposal to tear up 79th

01:30:50.548 --> 01:30:52.607
because it just ain't worth it.

01:30:53.518 --> 01:30:55.076
Thank you.

01:30:55.787 --> 01:30:58.756
That's my friend!
That's my friend!

01:31:08.599 --> 01:31:12.899
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

01:31:14.072 --> 01:31:16.506
We'll take a brief recess
and we'll come back with our decision.

01:31:24.948 --> 01:31:27.416
You're through.
You know that, don't you?

01:31:36.593 --> 01:31:39.255
- That was beautiful, man.
- Thanks.

01:31:39.363 --> 01:31:42.389
- How much they offer you?
- Not enough.

01:31:51.208 --> 01:31:54.041
We have reached
a unanimous decision.

01:31:56.246 --> 01:31:59.647
The proposal
from Quality Land Development

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:01.581
has been approved.

01:32:02.152 --> 01:32:03.915
This meeting is over.

01:32:08.058 --> 01:32:09.457
What have you done?

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.461
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Money, money, money!

01:32:12.563 --> 01:32:15.293
What in the world
you people thinkin' about?

01:33:42.636 --> 01:33:44.160
Well, I'll be.

01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:50.872
How you gonna leave town
without givin' my ring back?

01:33:52.295 --> 01:33:54.263
I've been lookin'
for your ass for 35 years.

01:33:54.364 --> 01:33:56.958
And I've been carrying
that cheap-ass thing with me

01:33:57.067 --> 01:33:59.058
'cause I knew
that's all you wanted.

01:33:59.169 --> 01:34:02.969
Cheap? You saddity ho,
give me my shit.

01:34:03.073 --> 01:34:04.700
- You ain't changed.
- You ain't, either.

01:34:07.944 --> 01:34:09.969
Piece of shit, my ass.

01:34:17.287 --> 01:34:19.482
- Come here, girl.
- No, you come here.

01:34:19.589 --> 01:34:21.489
- You come here.
- No, you come here.

01:34:21.591 --> 01:34:24.025
- Get your butt over here.
- No, you come here.

01:34:24.127 --> 01:34:26.459
Look at you.
Lord have mercy.

01:34:26.563 --> 01:34:28.030
You look good.

01:34:31.534 --> 01:34:33.593
You look pretty, too.

01:34:34.271 --> 01:34:37.900
- Don't make me chase your ass again.
- I like when you chase me.

01:34:38.008 --> 01:34:40.806
I been 35 years
chasin' after you.

01:34:42.279 --> 01:34:45.442
You still got that mattress
on the floor?

01:34:47.217 --> 01:34:48.946
What you thinkin'?

01:34:49.052 --> 01:34:52.886
We might be able to get down there.
I don't know if we gonna get up.

01:34:54.024 --> 01:34:56.049
Nothin' to worry about.
They ain't even real Chicago barbers.

01:34:57.777 --> 01:34:59.472
- Mornin', fellas.
- Mornin', young fellow.

01:34:59.578 --> 01:35:02.411
- You finally got a day off?
- I quit.

01:35:02.515 --> 01:35:04.415
- They fired you?
- No, no.

01:35:04.517 --> 01:35:06.075
You know you got fired.

01:35:06.185 --> 01:35:08.653
Look at you...
your shirt's still smokin'.

01:35:08.754 --> 01:35:11.814
No, I quit on principle.
Politics ain't my thing.

01:35:11.924 --> 01:35:15.451
What's going on here?
Look at you.

01:35:15.561 --> 01:35:17.461
Well, lookit here.
If it ain't Bobby and Whitney.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.314
Don't try
the opposite-direction thing.

01:35:21.416 --> 01:35:22.906
Richard and I are just friends.

01:35:23.018 --> 01:35:24.485
"Richard. "

01:35:24.586 --> 01:35:26.816
It's "Richard" at work
and "Big Daddy" in the bedroom.

01:35:26.922 --> 01:35:30.414
Listen, little man, I got a daddy.
I don't need another one.

01:35:30.525 --> 01:35:32.652
So keep your mouth shut
before I punch you in it.

01:35:32.761 --> 01:35:35.093
She's back.

01:35:35.197 --> 01:35:37.062
- What you doin' here?
- He got fired.

01:35:37.165 --> 01:35:38.530
I did not get fired.

01:35:40.435 --> 01:35:41.561
All right, fellas, how you doin'?

01:35:43.289 --> 01:35:44.313
Clown.

01:35:47.426 --> 01:35:48.984
Clown!

01:35:49.094 --> 01:35:52.188
Well, Jimmy,
first chair is open.

01:35:52.831 --> 01:35:56.494
Your old chair is open.
Quiet as it's kept.

01:35:56.602 --> 01:35:58.593
I don't know how long
we gonna be open.

01:35:58.704 --> 01:36:00.865
We gonna find out today.

01:36:12.317 --> 01:36:15.115
- Hey, Calvin.
- Good morning.

01:36:28.467 --> 01:36:29.695
All right!

01:36:31.236 --> 01:36:33.568
My chair open.
Come on.

01:36:37.409 --> 01:36:38.569
Snap.

01:36:38.677 --> 01:36:41.407
What the hell he do?

01:36:41.513 --> 01:36:43.344
Well, I'll be da...

01:36:44.016 --> 01:36:46.985
Hold on. Where the hell
is my uterus?

01:36:47.086 --> 01:36:49.520
In the Dumpster
with the rest of that mess.

01:36:49.621 --> 01:36:51.589
If we goin' out,
we goin' out like us.

01:36:51.690 --> 01:36:52.816
That's right.

01:36:54.159 --> 01:36:56.423
- We back, Big C?
- Yup.

01:36:56.528 --> 01:36:58.587
- What you doin' here?
- He got fired.

01:36:58.697 --> 01:37:00.858
- Whatever.
- You quit?

01:37:02.034 --> 01:37:03.592
I ain't a politician.

01:37:04.937 --> 01:37:07.838
- Don't tell me you quit.
- What was I supposed to do?

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:10.568
Is Lalowe Brown
the only politician in Chicago?

01:37:19.151 --> 01:37:21.346
Listen, Cal...

01:37:21.453 --> 01:37:24.115
Don't even worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

01:37:24.823 --> 01:37:26.313
Good to have you back.

01:37:27.192 --> 01:37:28.352
Good to be back.

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:31.258
Archie Bunker and George Jefferson
back together again.

01:37:33.265 --> 01:37:35.961
- Respect, man.
- All right, respect.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.138
Yo, what's up?

01:38:40.399 --> 01:38:43.368
- What's happenin', y'all?
- What's goin' on?

01:38:43.468 --> 01:38:44.992
Can somebody tighten me up?

01:38:45.103 --> 01:38:47.298
Come on over here, Wakefield.
Sit down.

01:38:47.406 --> 01:38:48.805
Serve you right.

01:38:48.907 --> 01:38:50.772
What's up, Cal?

01:38:50.876 --> 01:38:52.810
What's up, y'all?
Quick lineup?

01:38:52.911 --> 01:38:53.878
What's happenin'?

01:38:53.979 --> 01:38:55.344
I got you, playboy.

01:38:55.447 --> 01:38:59.042
Calvin, I like
what you said yesterday.

01:38:59.151 --> 01:39:00.641
What's up, man?

01:39:01.653 --> 01:39:03.314
Dinka, can you hook me up?

01:39:03.422 --> 01:39:05.856
Yes, sir.
No problem.

01:39:05.958 --> 01:39:07.550
Leave my customers alone.

01:39:07.659 --> 01:39:09.251
That's Rick's.

01:39:12.731 --> 01:39:15.199
Hey, Rick, I'm next with you.

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:17.291
All right.
Whatever you want here.

01:39:17.402 --> 01:39:19.996
It looks to me
like the village has spoken.

01:39:20.606 --> 01:39:24.098
It's okay.
Just a minor setback.

01:39:25.077 --> 01:39:26.374
Minor.

01:39:26.478 --> 01:39:28.105
We can get through this.

01:39:31.683 --> 01:39:32.877
"We"?

01:39:34.586 --> 01:39:38.352
Young man, you're on your own.

01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:41.381
Remember that.

01:39:47.232 --> 01:39:48.995
Hey, Isaac, play somethin'.

01:39:49.101 --> 01:39:52.730
Anything but R. Kelly. Please.
Somethin' wrong with that boy.

01:39:52.838 --> 01:39:56.001
He need some serious help.
We ain't listenin' to no R. Kelly.

01:39:56.108 --> 01:39:59.168
Hold, now. Don't start
talkin' about R. Kelly.

01:39:59.278 --> 01:40:01.508
I saw the tape.
Y'all see the tape?

01:40:01.613 --> 01:40:03.877
- Yeah, I saw the tape.
- How that boy gonna say it ain't him?

01:40:03.982 --> 01:40:07.349
You can't believe everything.
The media likes to spin stuff.

01:40:07.452 --> 01:40:09.044
- That was him.
- You don't know.

01:40:09.154 --> 01:40:11.748
- I think he was set up.
- He was set up.

01:40:11.857 --> 01:40:15.725
He set up the camera.
That's what he did!

01:40:15.827 --> 01:40:19.627
He had his head so far
up that girl's behind,

01:40:19.731 --> 01:40:21.358
you thought it was Groundhog Day.

01:40:21.466 --> 01:40:24.594
But that ain't him.
It ain't just him.

01:40:24.703 --> 01:40:27.570
Michael Jackson... his problem
is he got a Ferris wheel.

01:40:27.673 --> 01:40:31.040
How you gonna be a pedophile
with a Ferris wheel?

01:40:31.143 --> 01:40:35.102
Kobe Bryant... everybody thought
he was Mr. Goody Two-shoes.

01:40:35.213 --> 01:40:37.841
Come to find out
he ain't have on no shoes.

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:39.974
He didn't have on
no socks, either.

01:40:40.085 --> 01:40:41.609
Man, and Luther Vandross.

01:40:44.356 --> 01:40:45.323
You done gone too goddamn far.

01:40:46.675 --> 01:40:49.371
Don't talk about
Luther Vandross, okay?

01:40:49.477 --> 01:40:51.001
Luther's sick, man.

01:40:52.113 --> 01:40:54.673
- I can't talk about Luther Vandross?
- No!

01:40:54.783 --> 01:40:58.219
Everybody in here sayin'
I can't talk about Luther Vandross?

01:40:58.319 --> 01:40:59.718
No!

01:40:59.821 --> 01:41:01.880
I can't talk
about Luther Vandross?

01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:04.857
What you gonna do
about it, then?

01:41:05.493 --> 01:41:08.656
Eddie, that's what I'm talkin' about.
That's enough!

01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:10.258
That's enough!
