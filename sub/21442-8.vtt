WEBVTT

00:07.540 --> 00:09.042
- Thanks for joining us
on another episode

00:09.109 --> 00:10.110
of "The Dude Perfect Show."

00:10.176 --> 00:11.678
I'm Ty.
- And I'm Garrett.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.913
- And it's a great day
here at DPHQ2.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.515
One thing that me and Gar
have always thought

00:15.582 --> 00:17.417
that we'd be wonderful at
is doing a little bit

00:17.484 --> 00:21.287
of sideline reporting,
color commentary, in the action.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.990
To take sportscasting
to the next level.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.892
We've got our good buddy Cods
out in the field.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.861
- Hey, Ty, Cody here
out in the field.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.362
Uh, man, have you not tried--

00:29.429 --> 00:30.997
- Cods, just wanted
to introduce ya.

00:31.064 --> 00:33.900
Didn't need to get any
commentary from ya right now,

00:33.967 --> 00:35.869
but anyways--but we think
we can bring something

00:35.935 --> 00:37.170
to the play-by-play action game.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.538
What do you think, Gar?

00:38.605 --> 00:40.540
- That's right, Ty, something
I personally dreamed of.

00:40.607 --> 00:41.875
What about you, Cody?

00:41.941 --> 00:44.277
- Yes, sideline reporting
has been a big dream of mine.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.346
That's how raisins
become grapes.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.148
Back to you, Ty.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.816
- Obviously, we need
a little bit of work.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.786
So let's get started.

00:52.852 --> 00:55.155
And this is the part where they
leave the camera on you

00:55.221 --> 00:57.724
way too long, so you just smile
and look pretty.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.527
And eventually they'll cut away
to another reporter.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.063
- So they're not gonna do that.

01:04.129 --> 01:05.532
This is just a test.

01:05.598 --> 01:08.034
- Dang, can we redo that thing,
I had something in my teeth.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.236
- We're live, Cody.
- Oh, my bad.

01:10.303 --> 01:15.175
- ♪

01:15.241 --> 01:18.878
♪ La, la, la,
here we go, go, go ♪

01:18.945 --> 01:21.614
♪ Oooh, oooh, go, go, go ♪

01:21.681 --> 01:24.751
♪ La, la, la, here we go ♪♪

01:24.818 --> 01:26.886
- ♪

01:26.953 --> 01:28.221
- Alright, Marc,
these are the guys.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.390
Garrett, this is Marc.
- Good to meet ya.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.859
- This is Cody.
- Good to see you.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.028
- Sportscaster extraordinaire.
- Oh, nice.

01:35.094 --> 01:36.830
{\an8}- I heard you guys
needed some help.

01:36.896 --> 01:39.265
{\an8}So I did major league baseball,
did some Braves' games.

01:39.332 --> 01:41.100
{\an8}Thrashers when I was in Atlanta.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.303
Did a lot of sideline stuff.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.338
And I understand you're doing
something a little different.

01:45.405 --> 01:47.040
- So, what we're trying
to do is dive

01:47.106 --> 01:48.475
into the sportscasting world,

01:48.541 --> 01:50.510
put a little bit different spin
on it, where we get

01:50.577 --> 01:53.413
in the action, in the game
as much as possible.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.815
- They kinda frown on that
when you're on the sideline

01:55.882 --> 01:57.116
a little bit,
getting in the game.

01:57.183 --> 01:58.585
You gotta be careful.

01:58.651 --> 02:00.553
I understand you guys are doing
a little something different.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.021
- Yeah, so that's the goal.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.057
So me and Garrett
are gonna be up in the box.

02:04.123 --> 02:05.725
Cody is gonna be
our sideline reporter.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.328
Cody's not gonna be able to see
where he's at, what environment.

02:08.394 --> 02:10.096
Me and Garrett will be able to.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.798
We'll kinda give him clues,
walk him through it.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.666
- We like to train
in odd scenarios.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.169
- That's good, because you just
gotta roll with what's going on.

02:16.236 --> 02:18.204
And you might not even know
what's going on behind you.

02:18.271 --> 02:19.939
Gotta be on your toes
at all times.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.174
- First things first,
let's make sure

02:21.241 --> 02:22.976
the mic's turned the right way.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.477
Alright, are you guys ready
to get started?

02:24.544 --> 02:25.612
- Let's do it.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.414
- Here we go.
And, Cods, your first clip.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.583
- Oh, I thought--
- And Cody down to you.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.752
Wow, it looks like you've got
some bad weather down there.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.421
- Bad weather, Ty, I can feel
the weather from here.

02:35.488 --> 02:38.358
Let me tell you,
this section mainly is--

02:38.424 --> 02:39.893
- TYLER: Whoa, there's
a guy blowing away!

02:39.959 --> 02:41.227
- Oh!

02:41.294 --> 02:43.129
- How are you staying so dry?

02:43.196 --> 02:46.132
- You know, Gar,
I put on a moist spray

02:46.199 --> 02:47.800
that's actually
a--it's waterproof.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.035
- Yeah, absolutely.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.570
You might wanna check
on that guy down there.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.605
- Okay, I will do that.
- TYLER: Okay.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.841
- You know, don't be afraid
to fake it either, you know?

02:54.908 --> 02:57.477
Talk about a play that happened,
even if something's going on

02:57.544 --> 03:00.179
behind you that's different,
just kinda give 'em some advice.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.714
And let's try another one.
- TYLER: Okay.

03:01.781 --> 03:02.882
- Alright, well, Ty,

03:02.949 --> 03:04.117
that's seems like
a dangerous situation.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.985
I'm glad Cody's okay.

03:06.052 --> 03:07.186
Let's hit him
with the next clip.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.721
- Absolutely, Gar.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.857
Oh, Cods.
- What? What's going on?

03:10.924 --> 03:11.958
- GARRETT: That is unexpected.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.626
He is very high up there.
- Oh wow.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.863
- Have you ever seen a mascot
that high up on a fence, Cods?

03:16.930 --> 03:19.098
- You know, Ty, I've seen
a lot of mascots

03:19.165 --> 03:22.702
and a lot of tall objects,
but not that high.

03:22.769 --> 03:23.836
- I agree.
- Oooh!

03:23.903 --> 03:27.073
- Oh, he fell off. He fell off.
Didn't he?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.908
- Go with it, go with it,
right, he fell.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.176
- Oh my word.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.711
- Tell 'em you're gonna
go work on something.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.713
You're gonna find more
information for them.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.181
While I get it, back to you.

03:35.248 --> 03:37.016
- Hey, guys, I'm gonna go
and get an interview

03:37.083 --> 03:38.084
with the guy that fell.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.485
It doesn't look good,
but I'll get you

03:39.552 --> 03:41.454
some more insight
coming up next.

03:41.521 --> 03:42.722
Back to you guys.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.857
- You don't even have
to say, "Back to you, guys."

03:44.924 --> 03:46.359
You can just go with, "Guys?"

03:46.426 --> 03:48.695
And then they'll--
- Short it up.

03:48.761 --> 03:49.996
- Mix it up a little bit.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.431
- MARC: --sportscaster thing,
too.

03:51.497 --> 03:54.133
I want you to sum up the story
again, and then the game's over,

03:54.200 --> 03:56.603
kinda put a bow on it
is what we're trying to do here.

03:56.669 --> 03:58.104
- And that's all for tonight,
folks.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.138
Thanks for joining us.

03:59.205 --> 04:00.473
I'm Ty.
- And I'm Garrett.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.675
- And you're watching
Dude Perfect Sports Network.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.876
Have a good night.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.445
- Man, you guys are ready.

04:05.511 --> 04:07.246
I think you're ready.
- TYLER: I like it.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.982
- You're ready for
little league baseball maybe.

04:09.048 --> 04:10.483
- That is a start.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.418
- Well, thanks for your help,
Marc. 'Preciate it.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.954
- I think we came a long way
in a short period of time.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.490
I think you've got interesting
angle on the sportscasting.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.625
Definitely different,
but I wish you the best of luck.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.728
Keep working at it.
We'll see you guys.

04:21.793 --> 04:22.862
- You want that back, sir?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.131
- Hey, listen,
let's keep working on that.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.265
- Give me this.

04:26.332 --> 04:28.434
- We've got a lot of work to do.
- Okay.

04:28.501 --> 04:29.669
- ♪

04:29.736 --> 04:31.771
- So, Ty, I think
we send this to Cody.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.972
He has a better angle on this.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.540
- I agree. Cody?

04:34.607 --> 04:36.242
- Yeah, thanks, Ty,
I'm down here with Coby.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.577
I've got a great angle on it.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.079
He's using a--yep, pretty
standard golf ball.

04:40.146 --> 04:41.447
He's got a 2 ball, a putter.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.483
Uh, the shaft seems to be bent
right at the bottom.

04:43.549 --> 04:45.351
Uh, pretty thick grip
for my liking,

04:45.418 --> 04:46.719
but he seems to enjoy it.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.355
Uh, these are actually--nope,
they're not golf shoes.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.524
And these are definitely
skinny sweatpants.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.259
Back to you, Ty.
- Thanks, Cods.

04:53.326 --> 04:54.594
'Preciate all that information.

04:54.661 --> 04:57.163
Wow, that's--I mean, you don't
get that kind of intel

04:57.230 --> 04:58.531
unless you got
a man on the green.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.633
- GARRETT: Yeah,
I agree with ya.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.535
- Ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for joining us tonight.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.537
And welcome to
The Dude Perfect Sports Network.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.172
I'm Ty.
- And I'm Garrett.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.341
- And it is a beautiful night
for baseball.

05:08.408 --> 05:11.177
And I gotta say, Gar, it's
windier than a bean-eating troll

05:11.244 --> 05:13.546
out here right now.
- It sure is, Ty.

05:13.613 --> 05:16.716
We got an epic showdown tonight
of team blue versus team white.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.718
And I gotta say, you're not
supposed to be biased here,

05:18.785 --> 05:23.322
but my favorite color is blue.
- BOTH: [laughs]

05:23.389 --> 05:26.359
- We are here to take
sportscasting to the next level.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.627
- Yes, we are, Ty.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.763
- We are literally
in second base right now.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.299
- I gotta say, if there's any
lefties coming up to bat,

05:33.366 --> 05:35.001
I am gonna have to be
on my toes.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.137
- Oh, no worries, Gar, 'cause
I've got us covered right here.

05:38.204 --> 05:40.339
- I did not get the memo
to bring a glove.

05:40.406 --> 05:43.342
- Oh, well, shotout to our
sideline reporter Cody Jones,

05:43.409 --> 05:45.411
who will be on the field
with the players

05:45.478 --> 05:46.813
getting in-depth interviews.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.614
- Cody, how's it going
down on the field?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.450
- Hey, Gar, I'm here
live on the sidelines

05:50.516 --> 05:52.085
here with Thomas
the right fielder.

05:52.151 --> 05:53.553
Thomas, how old are ya?

05:53.619 --> 05:55.621
- I'm 10 years old.
- Ten years old.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.824
Thomas, I gotta be honest,
have you had braces?

05:57.890 --> 05:58.891
- Yes, sir.

05:58.958 --> 05:59.992
- Great teeth, young man.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.194
Any chest hair yet?

06:01.260 --> 06:03.029
- ALL: [laughing]

06:03.096 --> 06:04.697
- No.
- We'll work on that.

06:04.764 --> 06:05.732
You guys look shipshape.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.133
I'm ready to see ya play.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.168
Back to you guys in the booth,
Ty and Gar.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.470
- GARRETT: Thanks, Cody.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.338
Oh, the players are
taking the field I see, Ty.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.140
- Oh, yes.
Let's go down to Cody.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.042
Looks like he's with
the pitcher right now.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.377
- Hey, Gar and Ty, I'm here--
I'm here with the pitcher.

06:18.444 --> 06:19.779
He's about to throw
the first pitch.

06:19.846 --> 06:20.713
What are you gonna throw?

06:20.780 --> 06:21.814
- Fastball.
- Oh, it's coming.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.083
Okay, fastball, you
heard it here first.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.284
- Thanks, Cods.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.253
- Ryan Clayton has stepped up
to the plate.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.421
- Okay.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.790
- And you know they call him
Big Red.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.959
Oh, and there's a ball
right over our heads.

06:33.025 --> 06:34.427
- Oh my, this is
a dangerous idea.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.728
- Oh, and what a catch.

06:35.795 --> 06:36.763
Cutoff man.

06:36.829 --> 06:37.964
Here you go.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.199
There it is.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.768
Right to the pitcher there.
Ooh, ooh.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.803
- Very nice.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.138
- Wow.
- [laugh]

06:45.204 --> 06:46.973
- ♪

06:47.039 --> 06:48.875
- Oooh, wow!

06:48.941 --> 06:52.211
- ♪

06:52.278 --> 06:54.547
- And that will do it
for the first inning.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.449
- Ty, I say we move
our broadcast booth

06:56.516 --> 06:59.018
by the first baseman so we are
more in the action.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.654
- Sounds good to me, Gar.
- Alright.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.823
- What do you say we hang out
about right here?

07:03.890 --> 07:05.491
- This is a great spot.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.326
- Nathan Heart batting .357.

07:07.393 --> 07:08.928
Oh, hard hit ball to third.

07:08.995 --> 07:11.430
Oh, Cods, over to you,
did that ball catch your foot?

07:11.497 --> 07:13.199
- Yeah, guys, I don't wanna
blame myself,

07:13.266 --> 07:14.367
but I'm gonna blame myself.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.635
I got in
the third baseman's way.

07:15.701 --> 07:16.869
What's your name, buddy?
- Adam.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.005
- Adam, what happened there?
- I just missed it.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.174
- No, I'm telling you right now,
I was right here.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.275
It wasn't his fault.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.010
It hit a rogue rock,
dove to the right.

07:24.076 --> 07:25.311
Not his fault.
Back to you guys.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.046
- I gotta say, Cody,
was it partially due

07:27.113 --> 07:28.648
to your size 14 shoe?

07:28.714 --> 07:30.750
- Gar, I'm 13 1/2,
thank you very much.

07:30.817 --> 07:33.586
Uh, and it was not because
of the shoe, it was the rock.

07:33.653 --> 07:34.987
- Got it. I don't know, man,

07:35.054 --> 07:36.923
I feel like we should
wheel over to second.

07:36.989 --> 07:38.558
- TYLER: Okay.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.393
- Yeah, we'll really get close
to the back here,

07:40.459 --> 07:42.662
see if this guy
decides to steal.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.330
Oh, it's a ball hit to second.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.098
- We're ging home!
And we're safe!

07:46.165 --> 07:48.734
- Cods, down to you
with the first run of the game.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.270
- How'd it feel to get
in the first run of the night?

07:51.337 --> 07:52.405
- Good.
- Cods, you're interviewing

07:52.471 --> 07:54.740
the wrong kid.
- Oh right here. Here we go,

07:54.807 --> 07:56.909
wrong--well, they're all wearing
the same color uniform.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.211
It's kinda tough down here.

07:58.277 --> 07:59.679
Hey, so what'd it feel like
on third

07:59.745 --> 08:01.781
when you heard
the crack of the bat?

08:01.848 --> 08:04.817
- Uh, I just went straight home.
- Hey, you heard it here first.

08:04.884 --> 08:07.286
Back to you guys.
- Thanks, Cody, wow.

08:07.353 --> 08:09.021
- Ty, how 'bout this inning,
we make our way

08:09.088 --> 08:11.224
to the pitcher's mound so we can
see what he's throwing?

08:11.290 --> 08:12.692
- [mumbling] I like
the sound of that.

08:12.758 --> 08:16.762
- ♪

08:16.829 --> 08:19.866
- I gotta say, Ty, I am really
wishing I had a glove right now,

08:19.932 --> 08:22.602
because, boy, I could
take a shot to the face.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.671
- Oh, and a hard hit ball
deep to center.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.373
Oh, and it's over his head.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.309
That is an extra base hit.

08:30.376 --> 08:31.944
- Boys, how is it
being in the field?

08:32.010 --> 08:34.013
- I'll tell you what, it's
a little bit more dangerous

08:34.080 --> 08:36.215
than we thought it would be.
- You really gotta have

08:36.282 --> 08:37.884
your head on a swivel.
- Heads up, Gar.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.419
Oh. [laughs]

08:40.486 --> 08:43.789
And Wylie swings, and it's
a high ball to shortstop.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.592
He's back, he's got it.
Runner goes home!

08:46.659 --> 08:48.294
We got a play at the plate!

08:48.361 --> 08:50.696
Oh! He's safe!

08:50.763 --> 08:52.398
And the runner moves over.

08:52.465 --> 08:56.135
And just like that, we got
ourselves a tie ballgame.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.603
No we don't.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.372
What's the score, Gar?

08:59.438 --> 09:01.807
- Pretty sure
it's two to one, Tyler.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.077
- Well, it sounds better
when you say tie ballgame.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.313
You know, Gar, I gotta say
getting in the game

09:07.380 --> 09:08.981
was the best idea
we have had yet.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.584
But it is the bottom of
the sixth, so I think it's time

09:11.651 --> 09:13.519
we get closer
than we've ever been before.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.954
- That seems like
a terrible idea.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.757
But I gotta trust my broadcast
partner, so let's do this.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.426

09:20.493 --> 09:22.094
- Alright, Gar,
that feels about right.

09:22.161 --> 09:25.264
And let's go down to Cody
for a quick in-game interview.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.532
- Yeah, I'm here
with the batter.

09:26.599 --> 09:27.633
Batter, what's your name?
- Jacob.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.868
- Jacob. Jacob, you're a leftie.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.403
Are you nervous about
hitting one of 'em?

09:30.469 --> 09:31.804
- No.
- I'm not either.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.940
Back to you guys in the booth.
- Good job, Cody.

09:34.006 --> 09:35.574
- Alright, we've got
a runner on second.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.777
Tying run is at the plate.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.113

09:41.180 --> 09:43.983
- Wow.
- Over to first base. Oh.

09:44.050 --> 09:48.621
- I gotta say, Ty, my life
flashed before my eyes there.

09:48.688 --> 09:51.657
- We've got two outs, bottom
of the sixth, runner on third.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.259
Big at bat right here.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.462

and he pops it up.

10:03.536 --> 10:07.940
Hit is short! He does it.
That's the ballgame.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.643
And the blue team
comes out on top.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.479
And the crowd goes wild.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.781
And I gotta say, Gar,
this on the field thing

10:15.848 --> 10:17.850
is absolutely spectacular.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.119
- You gotta take risks
if you wanna be the best.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.621
- Special thanks to Cody,
sideline reporter--

10:22.688 --> 10:24.890
- Thank you all for having me.
I had a great night.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.526
It was a lot of fun.
- Yep, Cods, thank you.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.595
And I'm Ty.
- And I'm Garrett.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.397

The Dude Perfect Sports Network.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.499
And as always, don't try
to catch a mongoose

10:33.566 --> 10:38.437
with your bare hands.
- [laughs]

10:38.504 --> 10:40.373
- Keep smiling, Gar.

10:40.439 --> 10:41.540
Don't break eye contact.

to "The Dude Perfect Show."

11:04.397 --> 11:06.032
Our editor Chad recently
went on a lake trip.

11:06.098 --> 11:07.533
Came back, and showed me a photo

11:07.600 --> 11:09.568
of him doing a flip
on a wakeboard.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.370
Pretty impressive, my man.
- Thanks, man.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.705
- It was pretty sweet.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.673
I got inspired and asked Chad
to help me perform

11:14.740 --> 11:17.076
my very first ever
flip on a wakeboard.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.844
What do you think, Chadster?
- Let's do it.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.013
- Okay. And like any
good barter system,

11:21.080 --> 11:23.783
it would only be fair for me to
return the favor and teach Chad

11:23.849 --> 11:25.885
something
that I'm familiar with.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.753
Like bullwhip cracking.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.888
- [whip cracks]
- What?

11:28.954 --> 11:30.389
- Yeah.
- No.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.758
- You can try it on your
friends. It's gonna be great.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.960
- I didn't sign up for this.
- Guys, get in here.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.495

11:48.007 --> 11:49.475

- Yeah.

11:50.676 --> 11:51.644

like this.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.048
- Yeah.

11:56.115 --> 11:58.117
- Quick feet. How was that?

11:58.184 --> 12:00.252
- Oh, so what does this
have to do with wakeboarding?

12:00.319 --> 12:02.054
- Nothing.
I just have a few key things

12:02.121 --> 12:04.056
I gotta do every time I get
to a trampoline park.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.325
- Why is he even here?
- What?

12:06.392 --> 12:08.427
- Chad, I'm not gonna be there
for the real thing.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.030
And once I heard that you
were gonna be coach of him,

12:11.097 --> 12:12.398
I couldn't miss this, man.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.699
This is gonna be hilarious.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.202
But I don't wanna
learn bullwhipping.

12:16.268 --> 12:17.203
- Are you sure?

12:17.269 --> 12:18.737
I'll teach you two
at the same time.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.873
- First off, we probably
need to learn

12:20.940 --> 12:23.309
actually get on the water. So--

12:23.375 --> 12:25.744
- Is this the end I hold?
- Yes, that is.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.546
So the hardest part is,
you're gonna be actually

12:27.613 --> 12:29.949
starting off standing up.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.617

- It's not a boat.
We're not on a boat.

12:33.352 --> 12:35.121
- I don't start in the water?
- No.

12:35.187 --> 12:40.459
We need to engage the core and
to be able to jump out on it.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.828
So what we're gonna do is
I'm just gonna pull you back,

12:42.895 --> 12:44.430
and you're just not
gonna fall down, okay?

12:44.497 --> 12:47.166

than that.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.644

it goes to the right.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.014
- Okay, well you
didn't tell me that.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.449

supposed to know.
