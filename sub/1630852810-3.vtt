[opening theme music playing]

00:09.884 --> 00:11.302
[man] Hey!

00:25.650 --> 00:29.195
[Derek] Star light, bar fight,
first star I see tonight,

00:29.279 --> 00:33.575
I wish I may, I wish I might,
eat the dish I fish tonight.

00:33.658 --> 00:36.411
-[scoffs]
-Please bring Dad and Bean back.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.456
A shooting star! Did it work?

00:39.539 --> 00:40.790
Oh, God.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.292
Prayer games are over.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.085
Hurry up and get into bed.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.881
It's Tuesday night.
You-know-what begins in 20 minutes.

00:47.964 --> 00:48.923
Sex bingo!

00:49.007 --> 00:50.425
Shh. Tuck him in.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.136
Tsk-tsk.

00:53.219 --> 00:56.473
The pillow goes under his head,
not over it.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.515
[grunts]

00:58.391 --> 00:59.642
And remember, Derek,

00:59.726 --> 01:03.772
shooting stars are angels
plummeting to Hell.

01:03.855 --> 01:04.814
Good night.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.111
Well, that's no angel.
It's a seagull on fire.

01:12.572 --> 01:13.698
[seagull squawks]

01:14.616 --> 01:17.285
[Odval] What is that?
Some kind of clown car grave?

01:17.368 --> 01:19.496
[gasps] I can't believe my various eyes!

01:19.579 --> 01:21.706
Archdruidess, we have a problem.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.918
All these things ever see is a problem.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.503
[groans]

01:26.586 --> 01:28.588
Rising from the dead is witchcraft.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.632
Could Tiabeanie actually be a witch?

01:30.715 --> 01:32.133
Ah, no such thing.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.969
You know it's just a good excuse
to dispose of all the weirdos

01:35.053 --> 01:38.181
and free-thinkers and masturbators. Ugh.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.271
Hi, Pendergast.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.065
Dad, what are you talking about?

01:47.148 --> 01:48.316
That's not Pendergast.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.819
That's the poet who wrote
those mean nursery rhymes about you

01:50.902 --> 01:52.779
that all the babies
in Dreamland memorized.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.572
Listen, you can hear it right now.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.450
[toddlers singing] ♪ Old King Zøg
Dumb as a frog ♪

01:57.534 --> 02:00.286

02:00.370 --> 02:01.871
-[toddlers laughing]
-See?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.456
Bye, Pendergast.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.458
[Odval] And the king lives, too.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.418
What happened? We burnt them at the stake,

02:07.502 --> 02:10.004
but now they're alive
and completely raw and ungrilled.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.633
There's no other explanation.
Bean possesses powerful magic.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.427
She'll kill us all with her
goo-goo hoo-doo voodoo walla-walla--

02:16.511 --> 02:17.595
Ow!

02:17.679 --> 02:19.472
[grunts and yelps]

02:19.556 --> 02:21.224
Shut up and let me think.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.226
I'll tell you exactly what's happening.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.062
Someone must have helped
those troublemakers escape death,

02:26.146 --> 02:29.566
and I'm gonna find out who.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.277
Derek, honey,
you have some special visitors.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.571
Now, all you have to
tell those sweet boys… [groans]

02:34.654 --> 02:36.573
Where is the little bastard?

02:36.656 --> 02:38.158
[Derek] Yay!

02:38.241 --> 02:41.494
He's remarkably speedy
for such a beachball of a boy.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.458
Oh, Bean, you're alive!
I'm sorry for everything.

02:47.542 --> 02:51.379
Never ever, ever, ever
burn me alive at the stake again.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.881
All right, Luci, your turn.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.841
I should torment you
for the rest of your life,

02:54.924 --> 02:56.759
but I got my hands full with your sister.

02:56.843 --> 02:57.969
Okay, your turn, Elfo.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.221
I'm gonna break all your toys. Oh!

03:00.305 --> 03:02.765
And Old Daddy, you're back home.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.311
Oh! I love you
so much more than New Daddy.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.979
I won't say that doesn't hurt.

03:08.062 --> 03:10.940
Why, hello, sire. How are you feeling?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.442
About me, in particular?

03:12.525 --> 03:15.486
Huh? Who said that?
Who wanna know how I'm feelin'?

03:15.570 --> 03:17.405
Oh, I'll tell you how I'm feelin'.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.656
Raise the drawbridge.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.492
I'm feelin' great!

03:21.576 --> 03:22.660
Lower the drawbridge.

03:24.078 --> 03:28.833
'Cause down there I realized
important stuff I wasn't aware of before.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.084
Raise the drawbridge.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.045
[Zøg] About myself.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.630
Lower the drawbridge.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.343
I learnt there's an enemy
lurkin' among us.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.510
Raise the drawbridge.

03:40.470 --> 03:45.266
And its name is mental illness
and the stigma that accompanies it.

03:45.350 --> 03:49.062
Believe me, I know,
'cause I've been to Hell and back.

03:49.145 --> 03:52.315
I've seen things
no human eyeballs should ever see.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.985
I made noises
no human earholes should ever hear.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.573
[mimicking echo] I, I, I…
What, what, what…

04:00.657 --> 04:04.827
But I also discovered
the most important thing in life.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.120
And then I forgot it.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.581
And now, I just wanna lie down.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.376
So lower the goddamn drawbridge,
will ya, huh?

04:12.377 --> 04:15.213
Lower the goddamn drawbridge,
will ya, huh?

04:19.300 --> 04:21.052
I think we're getting away with it.

04:21.135 --> 04:24.138
Zøg's too crazy
to remember anything we did to him.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.807
How can we be sure?

04:25.890 --> 04:29.394
[Zøg mimicking echo and grumbling]

04:29.477 --> 04:31.062
[chuckles]

04:39.654 --> 04:42.240
Ugh! I swear, these tight, sexy clothes

04:42.323 --> 04:44.701
were designed
to cut off cognitive thinking.

04:48.329 --> 04:51.624
I was hoping you'd at least
keep that look for the party, Dagmar…

04:51.708 --> 04:52.667
I mean, Bean.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.962
Um… Hmm.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.801
[sighs] Now these boots
were made for thinking.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.177
[sarcastically] Yay.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.100
[blows trumpet]

05:09.183 --> 05:10.685
[crowd clapping]

05:13.021 --> 05:16.399
Fellow Dreamlanders,
our difficult period has passed.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.985
A beloved king
and father was gravely wounded,

05:19.068 --> 05:20.737
but miraculously recovered.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.489
I know that blue kid.
He lives in my building.

05:23.573 --> 05:27.535
A sister was accused of being a witch
and a brother burned her at the stake.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.538
These are the things
that we will look back on at holidays

05:30.621 --> 05:31.831
and laugh and laugh.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.333
[crowd laughing]

05:35.960 --> 05:37.545
[clears throat]

05:37.628 --> 05:41.090
So, Bean, I want you to know
I love you, and you're pardoned.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.925
Your crimes are forgiven.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.635
[crowd] Aw.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.929
-Wait, all of them?
-Uh, yeah, sure.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.973
Yes! Oh.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.309
Once again,
the rich white girl gets away with it.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.226
Justice!

05:52.310 --> 05:55.980
And in this spirit,
I would also like to pardon the following.

05:56.064 --> 06:00.902
"Elfo, Luci,
and last but not least, Old Man Touchy,

06:00.985 --> 06:04.155
on the condition that
you promise you will never touch again."

06:04.238 --> 06:05.531
I promise.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.827
I lied! [babbling]

06:10.411 --> 06:13.081
To be honest,
I'm glad the execution didn't take.

06:13.164 --> 06:16.000
That's what happens
when you ask a bonfire to do an ax's job.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.211
Otherwise, you'd be one dead witch.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.713
Thanks, Stan, but once again, not a witch.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.299
Just what a resurrected witch would say.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.718
Oh! Act casual, she's looking right at us.

06:25.802 --> 06:26.636
Hey, girl.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.264
Weird. Why is Odval being so friendly?

06:30.348 --> 06:32.391
And why is everyone
so casual about the fact

06:32.475 --> 06:34.143
that Dad and I are supposed to be dead?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.269
What about me?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.897
Nobody cared
either time I came back to life.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.317
I was disappointed both times.
Disappointment's a form of caring.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.905
Excuse me, but is anyone else
bothered by the rules of this world?

06:45.988 --> 06:49.200
I mean, people get
turned to stone or burned alive,

06:49.283 --> 06:52.203
and the next thing you know,
they're walking around, no harm, no foul.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.914
I mean, I myself
was shot with a flaming arrow--

06:54.997 --> 06:55.957
[groans]

06:57.875 --> 06:58.709
Who did that?

06:58.793 --> 07:02.338
They say,
"Heavy is the head that wears the crown."

07:02.421 --> 07:05.216
That's why it belongs
on the heaviest fathead around.

07:05.299 --> 07:10.179
And here he comes now.
My dad, your king, King Zøg.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.849
-[unenthusiastic clapping]
-[man 1] Yay.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.811
Give me that. [grunts]

07:16.894 --> 07:18.438
Get outta here.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.775
Thank you! Thank you very much.

07:22.859 --> 07:27.280
This is for all the kids out there
who dream of becomin' a king.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.950
Keep dreamin',
'cause I'm the only king here forever.

07:31.033 --> 07:34.454
All hail our only king here forever!

07:34.537 --> 07:37.874
And if you forget,
you get your head chopped off!

07:39.083 --> 07:40.460
Now, start cheerin'!

07:40.543 --> 07:43.087
[crowd cheering]

07:44.839 --> 07:48.176
Free drinks in the courtyard,
ya boozebags!

07:48.259 --> 07:49.677
[crowd cheers louder]

07:50.261 --> 07:53.181
[man 2] Okay, revolution's postponed
for another day.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.725
Anyway, I guess
it's better to be respected

07:55.808 --> 07:58.311
for who I am, not what I am, right?

07:58.394 --> 08:02.315
Who you are is a nobody,
and what you are ain't nothin'!

08:02.398 --> 08:03.983
[groans]

08:04.484 --> 08:06.903
[Archdruidess] Raise the drawbridge!

[Derek whimpers]

08:18.873 --> 08:20.416

08:20.500 --> 08:22.627
Who's that lurking in the dark alley?

08:22.710 --> 08:23.794
[grunts]

08:23.878 --> 08:24.754
[laughs]

08:24.837 --> 08:26.422
Perhaps new friends?

08:26.506 --> 08:29.967
-Greetings, ragamuffins! May I play?
-Sure.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.386
Wanna play a little game
called "Like This Whapsee"?

08:32.470 --> 08:35.014
Like This Whapsee? Well, how do you play?

08:35.097 --> 08:37.308
-Like this. Whap! See?
-Ow.

08:37.391 --> 08:39.101
Hey, ain't you a king or somethin'?

08:39.185 --> 08:43.564
Oh, I'm not a majesty anymore.
I'm a common idiot just like you fellas.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.900
Then I guess
you won't be needin' this crown.

08:45.983 --> 08:49.278
Yeah. I suppose I don't need it. Huh.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.240
Say, what's the big idea agreein' with us?

08:52.323 --> 08:54.325
Zippidee, Doo-Dah, barrelize him!

08:54.408 --> 08:57.912
But we ain't got no barrel.
We traded it for these crates.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.539
I can pretend I'm in a barrel.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.290
Stop bein' so agreeable!

09:01.374 --> 09:02.959
-All right.
-[all grunt]

09:03.543 --> 09:04.919

09:05.503 --> 09:06.963

09:07.505 --> 09:08.756
Ow, ow, ow.

[continues yelping]

09:21.852 --> 09:24.188
[Zøg laughing hysterically]

09:24.272 --> 09:26.274
Wow! Listen to Zøg's laughter.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.276
Someone must be getting executed.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.361
[muttering and laughing]

09:30.444 --> 09:33.197
Oh, Bean, get over here.
You gotta look at this.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.699
Again, sire?

09:34.782 --> 09:36.033
Mmm-hmm.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.535
[jingling]

09:37.618 --> 09:38.786
[laughing]

09:40.913 --> 09:44.458
Pendergast! Oh, it's funny
'cause it's true.

09:44.542 --> 09:49.213
I dreamed of this moment for so long,
but I'm more worried than validated.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.216
I ain't talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to the head.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.093
[chuckling] Ah!

09:54.176 --> 09:55.886
Dad, what's wrong with you?

09:55.970 --> 09:57.930
Ask Pendergast.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.223
[groaning]

10:02.059 --> 10:04.687
He knows everything.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.896
[Bean] Yikes.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.273
Okay, that's enough.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.151
Oh, no! I hope I die this time!

10:10.234 --> 10:12.737
Ow. Ow. Ow.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.988
[continues yelping]

10:15.323 --> 10:16.282
[grunts]

10:16.365 --> 10:20.244
I don't belong in the castle.
I don't belong with the common folk.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.370
[sighs wearily]

10:21.454 --> 10:23.748
Maybe the scary woods will accept me?

10:24.332 --> 10:28.586
Oh, a warning sign! "Beware of…" Uh-oh.

10:28.669 --> 10:31.505
I better not finish reading it
or I'll get too frightened.

10:31.589 --> 10:35.509
[suspenseful music playing]

10:35.593 --> 10:36.844
[Mertz's mother] Are you sure?

10:36.927 --> 10:39.055
Yes, Ma, I did wash my taint.

10:39.764 --> 10:40.598
I didn't.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.850
You're a sociopath.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.020
Murbish, Tertz, we're looking
for Pendergast. Have you seen him?

10:46.103 --> 10:49.774
Not since he told us to meet up with him
to help Zøg. Remember?

10:49.857 --> 10:52.360
Oh, yeah. Pendergast never showed up.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.528
Good thing, 'cause we didn't either.

10:54.612 --> 10:57.114
What was Pendergast
supposed to help my dad do?

10:57.198 --> 10:58.783
We'll never know.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.368
Well, where is Pendergast now?

11:00.451 --> 11:01.869
We'll never know.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.704
Well, this has been a waste of time.

Hey, Detective Dumbass,
have you checked his locker?

11:09.585 --> 11:11.587
-What the--
-[all exclaiming]

11:12.213 --> 11:13.589
It's Pendergast!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.675
Oh, my God! Who did this?

11:15.758 --> 11:19.011
He looks so different
with his head sliced off.

[suspenseful music playing]

11:24.767 --> 11:26.519

11:27.937 --> 11:29.355
Oh, hello, pretty pony.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.733
Don't be afraid.
Here, you want something to eat?

11:35.444 --> 11:36.779
Aw.

11:36.862 --> 11:37.947
Huh?

11:38.030 --> 11:39.573
Ah! Cut it out! Ouch!

11:41.367 --> 11:42.410
[Derek grunts]

11:48.791 --> 11:50.376
All right, eager beaver.

11:50.459 --> 11:53.671
Find the queen, win the dough.
Where she stops, nobody knows.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.884
It's in the middle.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.220
That one there, in the middle.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.431
[animals cheering]

12:05.766 --> 12:07.059
You gotta play this, pally.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.187
Oh, I don't know. How much does it cost?

12:10.271 --> 12:11.355
Whatever you got.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.982
That's what I got.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.781
I know. It's in the middle again.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.326
Wha… But I'm sure I saw--

12:24.410 --> 12:26.245
Sorry, pally, better luck next time.

[siren wailing in distance]

-Coppers! Skedeedle!

[mouse imitating siren]

12:36.672 --> 12:39.383
Aw, it's just a tender little mouse.

12:39.467 --> 12:43.137
Oh, help me. Help me, I need help.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.681
[Derek exclaiming]

12:45.764 --> 12:49.602
Hey! I don't hear any coins droppin'.
Where's all your goddamn money?

12:49.685 --> 12:52.938
I just lost everything
in a card game except my pants.

12:55.649 --> 12:59.278
You have the worst luck
I've ever seen. [cackles]

12:59.361 --> 13:02.198
I don't know how
this can get any more degrading.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.157
Hey, there.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.242
My name's Derek. Who are you?

13:05.326 --> 13:07.369
Well, no one's ever asked before.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.787
Name's Sagatha.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.164
You're beautiful.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.373
What are ya, blind?

13:11.457 --> 13:14.210
Please, don't tell me
you're gonna rob and beat me, too?

13:14.293 --> 13:16.795
-Why, you got any money?
-Well, not anymore.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.632
Well, you look rich.
Maybe we can work somethin' out.

13:19.715 --> 13:22.301
But right now,
I gotta get you outta here fast.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.981
Turn him over, boys.

Look, a hole in his armor.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.991
-[flesh squelching]
-That's disgusting.

13:46.075 --> 13:46.909
A bullet.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.328
If we find the gun,
we've got the murderer.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.663
Okay, let's split up.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.582
Elfo, you start on the top floor.
Luci, you start on the bottom.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.834
-You two stay here and guard the body.
-Yes, ma'am.

13:55.918 --> 14:00.464
We'd never let something happen
to our headless friend Pendergast.

For free?

14:22.486 --> 14:24.488
Maybe I will drown you.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.536
Don't ever walk barefoot around here.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.746
And never eat at the strip clubs.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.125
You know what really freaks me out?

When I opened that locker
and Pendergast's body fell forward,

14:39.962 --> 14:43.173
it's as if the killer
planned it that way, you know?

14:43.257 --> 14:46.260
Leaning the body
right up against the door like that.

No, wait, wait, wait.
That's not it. That's not it.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.371
I have it. This is the real question.
Here we go.

Who killed Pendergast?

16:09.593 --> 16:13.514
Unless she cast a spell on me
to make me believe she's a witch.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.557
Which would make her a witch.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.809
In which case, the witch…

Oh, Sorcerio, am I crazy?

16:18.852 --> 16:19.979
Yes, darling.

But often, the craziest thoughts
are the most true, ya nutloaf!

in Odval's office.

you're a delicate dandelion puff.

Shut up, you're both little jerks.
Now, look for the gun.

are out to get you.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.027
Four, only date someone
who actually likes ya.

Who's there to cheer you on,
who makes you laugh,

18:34.947 --> 18:38.575
who brings you soup when you're sick,
and ice cream when you're lazy,

18:38.659 --> 18:40.577
who gives you that special tingle.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.539
And when you meet this gal,
don't let her go.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.541
Well, that sounds like you.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.961
The hell are you talkin' about?
I was thinkin' someone more like Snarla.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.880
He can't handle what I got.
It's incurable.

18:51.964 --> 18:55.134
[Miss Moonpence] When I said "help,"
I meant with a cup of tea or a biscuit.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.677
I don't know where the gun is.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.930
And even if I did,
I couldn't say, only hint.

19:00.013 --> 19:03.725
Odval would have my job.
I hate that it's a man's world.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.937
Come on, guys,
we gotta find that gun fast.

-[Bean] The gun?

-Yes, Minister?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.555
I have a council meeting.
Did you finish those budgetary amendments?

19:41.638 --> 19:42.472
[Miss Moonpence] Yes, Minister.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.725
You made sure they're in my handwriting?

19:44.808 --> 19:46.894
[Miss Moonpence] Yes.
I sent them down with Sorcerio.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.061
Sorcerio?

19:48.145 --> 19:51.732
Oh, no, that wrinkled old buffoon
always mixes up the pages.

Sorry, Elfo, I tried jiggling the latch.
You live in there now.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.377
We gotta get outta here.
Odval could be back any second.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.630
[Miss Moonpence] Ahem.
Sometimes, it takes a woman

20:14.713 --> 20:16.840
to pick up the man's world
and run with it.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.929
[Elfo] Put me down.
I don't like being carried.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.850
At least we found the gun.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.937
Do you think my eyes
and bowels will stop spinning eventually?

21:12.020 --> 21:15.565
Yeah, probably, but please
stop making eye contact in the meantime.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.237
Without this gun,
Odval won't be able to shoot anybody else.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.322
Okay, Elfo.
[snapping fingers and whistling]

21:22.406 --> 21:24.116
Ow! I'm cured.

21:24.199 --> 21:27.661
Point out all of Bean's hiding spots
so we can stash the gun.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.464
And this is where I hide.

I'm not in there now.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.342
[Bean] Done. Gun hidden.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.678

Okay, kid,
we're gonna work on your gullibility.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.574
You're too trusting.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.201
Now go up there,
but don't get bamboozled by the cards.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.911
Watch the dealer.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.205
Watch his hands, watch his sleeves,

22:12.289 --> 22:15.042
watch his pockets,
and watch your watch while you're at it.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.461
Hey, it's the guy who always loses.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.713
Wanna try again? Everyone's a winner.

Not so fast! Caught you!

Go ahead. I don't need you.
I don't need nobody.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.109
[Derek] Hmm.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.237
[mouse gasps]

22:44.321 --> 22:47.157
You're not getting away
this time, you trouser-taker!

22:47.240 --> 22:49.576
-[crunching]
-Ow! She bit me!

22:49.659 --> 22:51.828
Ow! Hmm.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.041
-[mouse shrieks]
-Hmm. Ah.

22:56.875 --> 22:57.876
[mouse] Ow!

23:02.631 --> 23:05.383
[gasps] Breaking an old woman's cane.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.552
I hope you're proud of yourself.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.638
Hey! I am proud.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.600
You did it.
And you got your pants back, too.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.019
Thanks to you, Sagatha.

23:16.103 --> 23:19.439
You were a baby,
but now you're a man, baby.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.398
[kisses]

23:22.567 --> 23:25.070
It's time to go home. [whistles]

23:30.826 --> 23:32.619
What the hell happened to Prince Derek?

23:32.702 --> 23:34.913
He looks like someone
who just came of age, he does.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.876
[gasps]

23:41.253 --> 23:44.714
Guess you ain't
king of the crates no more, huh?

23:50.137 --> 23:51.054
[grunts]

23:52.347 --> 23:54.724
Oh, hi, Bean. I'm a man now.

23:54.808 --> 23:57.185
Shut up, Derek. I'm looking for a traitor.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.104
Oh, you're always doing that.

23:59.187 --> 24:02.482
Yeah, well, this one shot Pendergast.
With a gun.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.900
The gun you shot Dad with?

24:03.984 --> 24:06.361
You pardoned me for that. No backsies.

24:09.489 --> 24:13.493
Your attention, please!
Derek has a mustache now!

24:15.328 --> 24:18.290
Greetings! I have
something important to say.

24:19.082 --> 24:22.919
Sagatha, will you give me
your hand in marriage?

24:24.754 --> 24:26.631
My hand? Wha…

24:27.340 --> 24:28.925
Ah, I've married worse.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.677
What say you, Father?

24:41.521 --> 24:44.608
I've always wanted
teeny tiny grandchildren!

24:44.691 --> 24:46.443
They can ride around in your pocket, sire.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.362
Oh, wow. I did not expect that.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.907
I had a whole passionate speech
ready to go.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.450
Anyone still wanna hear it?

24:54.701 --> 24:55.535
No?

24:55.619 --> 24:57.704
Well, okay, then, let's have a wedding!

25:03.043 --> 25:05.795
[announcer] Now arriving
on his cute little pony,

25:05.879 --> 25:08.506
believe it or not, that's the bridegroom!

25:09.758 --> 25:12.928
Girls, girls, girls,
this is a classy affair.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.638
More cleavage.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.848
I meant butt cleavage.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.893
And last but not least or she'd kill me,

25:19.976 --> 25:25.148
former Queen of Dreamland,
now Pirate Queen of the Seventeen Seas,

25:25.232 --> 25:27.734
you guessed it, Oona!

25:30.737 --> 25:32.405
Hello, darlings!

25:33.698 --> 25:35.200
Oh, mother! You came!

25:35.283 --> 25:39.079
Yes. And I bring lovely wedding gift
for new bride.

25:40.121 --> 25:42.958
Oh, sorry. I forget to take off price tag.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.343
There you are. In your face.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.387
You think you're better than me? Oh.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.097
Yeah? Yeah?

25:57.180 --> 25:59.182
There you go, bitch. Suck on it!

25:59.266 --> 26:03.979
Zøggy, I'm so proud
our little boy is marrying anything.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.898
This means so much to whoever I am.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.442
Are you all right? Or are?

26:09.526 --> 26:10.986
-[babbling]
-Zøggy.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.113
-[continues babbling]
-Shh.

26:13.196 --> 26:15.323
[Oona] Quiet! Don't do that!

26:17.200 --> 26:18.118
[both exclaim]

26:20.412 --> 26:24.874
Don't we just look
absolutely bewitching in our dress?

26:24.958 --> 26:27.043
What about you, mister?

26:27.127 --> 26:30.422
If looks could kill,
you'd be arrested for double murder.

26:30.505 --> 26:31.798
What a lovely couple.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.134
Are you kidding? I'm so out of his league!

26:34.926 --> 26:36.678
Hey, Oona, hey!

26:36.761 --> 26:38.388
Crazy girl!

26:38.471 --> 26:41.391
Hey, what is wrong with your father?
I ask because--

26:41.474 --> 26:43.226
-[babbling]
-Zøggy!

26:43.310 --> 26:45.478
He was buried alive
and he didn't take it too well.

26:45.562 --> 26:46.980
[joyful music playing]

27:08.918 --> 27:14.841
Dearly beloved and the accursed,
we are gathered here today to celebrate--

27:14.924 --> 27:15.925
[Zøg babbling]

27:16.009 --> 27:19.971
Who in the world
is making that god-awful noise?

27:20.055 --> 27:21.973
-It's Zøg!
-[continues babbling]

27:22.057 --> 27:23.016
Zøg did it.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.186
Are you finished?

27:26.269 --> 27:27.854
[mimicking echo] Yes, yes, yes!

27:27.937 --> 27:32.108
To celebrate a truly bizarre
whirlwind romance--

27:32.192 --> 27:33.151
[Zøg] Wait, hold on.

27:33.234 --> 27:35.111
[babbling]

27:35.195 --> 27:36.279
Okay, I'm done.

27:38.239 --> 27:43.119
And finally, I promise never
to use a fly swatter, even in anger,

27:43.203 --> 27:46.873
and to believe in you
just like you believe in me.

27:46.956 --> 27:50.085
And now, Sagatha, your vows.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.961
Oh, this ought to be good.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.588
I got a nice thing going.

27:53.671 --> 27:56.132
I don't wanna mess it up
by opening my big mouth.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.259
[Archdruidess clears throat]

28:05.517 --> 28:06.351
[Sagatha grunts]

28:09.729 --> 28:14.943
If any of you has reason why
these two should not be married, clam up.

28:15.026 --> 28:18.113
They obviously don't care
what you or anyone thinks.

28:18.196 --> 28:21.866
Now, everyone bow their heads in prayer.

28:22.450 --> 28:23.326
Or disgust.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.912
But do it, 'cause all the other
major religions do it,

28:25.995 --> 28:27.205
so it must mean something.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.540
[gasps]

28:35.004 --> 28:37.424
Stop the wedding!
There's a traitor in the church!

28:37.507 --> 28:38.383
[crowd gasping]

28:38.466 --> 28:41.302
It's Odval! Odval killed Pendergast.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.013
He shot him
and then he chopped his head off!

28:44.097 --> 28:47.642
Nonsense. Why, look,
Pendergast is right here.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.603
Pendergast! You're alive!

28:51.312 --> 28:53.481
-[shrieking]
-[crowd gasping]

28:54.733 --> 28:56.901
Odval never had the nerve.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.154
[crowd gasping]

28:59.237 --> 29:00.572
How did you get the gun?

29:00.655 --> 29:04.075
Lots of people
have access to your room, Bean.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.286
I'm sorry, Bean.
She threatened to shoot me.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.704
Shut up, Turbish.

29:07.787 --> 29:10.540
But I now realize
she couldn't have without the gun.

29:10.623 --> 29:13.168
-[gunshot]
-[laughs mockingly] Missed me!

29:13.251 --> 29:14.711
-[gunshot]
-Ow.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.045
[crowd gasping]

29:16.129 --> 29:18.923
And now, it's time for the final shaddup.

29:19.007 --> 29:19.966
Don't do it!

29:20.049 --> 29:21.551
-Shaddup!
-No!

29:21.634 --> 29:23.094
[crowd gasping]

29:29.142 --> 29:31.269
Oh, Turbish! Turbish, are you dead?

29:31.352 --> 29:35.607
No, I'm alive.
I hid big skillet under tunic.

29:35.690 --> 29:37.776
[gasps] Did you say "big skillet"?

29:40.570 --> 29:43.323
-[engine revving]
-[crowd exclaiming]

29:44.532 --> 29:46.785
[Archdruidess cackling]

29:57.670 --> 30:00.215
I wish you had more horsepower, Smokey.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.976
[engine sputtering and dying]

30:12.060 --> 30:16.397
-[crowd gasping]
-[engine turning over]

30:16.481 --> 30:18.483
[crowd groaning]

30:18.566 --> 30:20.235
Well, she's gone forever.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.362
I wonder if she'll miss her road map.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.113
Give me that.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.367
Steamland.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.665
[Archdruidess cackling]

30:33.748 --> 30:35.917
[closing theme music playing]
