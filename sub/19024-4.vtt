WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:06.389
Ican't stress enough how much
you gotta avoid the red meat.

00:06.480 --> 00:09.552
Cirrhosis is preventing your liver
from filtering out toxins,

00:09.640 --> 00:14.077
and you could become encephalopathic,
leading to a mental status change.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.435
I'm gonna start acting crazy
or something?

00:16.520 --> 00:19.432
You'll need a tinfoil hat
to hold in all your thoughts.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.592
I can still have a tiny bite
of my wife's carne asada, right?

00:22.680 --> 00:25.240
- Well...
- The greatest thing about Carla

00:25.320 --> 00:27.914
is I always know I can count on her
to be the bad cop.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.831
What part of "no meat" don't you get?

00:29.920 --> 00:32.673
- I just thought...
- Carla!

00:32.759 --> 00:36.594
So if you don't listen to Dr Dorian,
you're gonna have to answer to me.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.955
- OK. Ix-nay on the eat-may.
- That's right.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.679
We're a team.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.753
- What?
- Eat-may sounds like eat me.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.434
Of course, on some teams
there's gonna be friction.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.318
All right, we're done here.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.709
- Bonnie, you close.
- Damn.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.473
Don't be mad. Just be the good
little bee-atch you are

00:56.560 --> 00:58.551
and wipe the sweat off my forehead.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.029
Look, don't say "bee-atch."
You can't pull it off.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.998
Interesting, being that you're
the queen mother of all...

01:05.080 --> 01:08.550
Dr Wen, my forehead's
feeling a little misty.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.835
Dr Turk, are your hands broken?

01:10.920 --> 01:13.229
No.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.471
- Here you go.
- That's nice.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.039
Bee-atch.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.957
And some teams
never really seem to get together.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.679
- I'm so glad I caught you...
- And there it is again.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.318
That ringing in my ears.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.868
It's kind of an...
but more piercing.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.918
It's more of an...

01:34.000 --> 01:36.116
She's trying to ask you a question.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.714
Now, you, you're more
of a low-pitched...

01:40.000 --> 01:42.992
It's more masculine,
which, quite frankly, is surprising,

01:43.080 --> 01:47.039
considering the source, but make
no mistake, oh, just equally annoying.

01:47.120 --> 01:52.433
Luckily, though,
I know how to make the pain go away.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.637
- Much better.
- Can you believe that?

01:55.720 --> 01:58.632
Every time we talk to him,
he goes off on a random tangent...

02:03.080 --> 02:06.629
-...you know?
- Clearly, we're on the same page.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.518
We're residents.
We should be treated like colleagues,

02:09.600 --> 02:12.068
and I can't even get him to notice me.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.151
Oh, God.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.317
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.795
OK.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.591
Maybe if you wore your hair up...

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.960 --> 02:53.188
What's up?

02:53.280 --> 02:55.748
Be careful here.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.115
Don't give him anything.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.839
Nothing. What is up with you, man?

03:00.920 --> 03:04.674
I always get this way in the fall.
Summer's gone, the days are shorter.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.832
It just makes me feel so...
What's the word?

03:07.920 --> 03:11.879
- Sad?
- Yes, that's it.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.475
I'm a janitor, so I couldn't
think of the word "sad."

03:15.560 --> 03:17.915
I was going to say
"it makes me feel so mop."

03:18.000 --> 03:21.276
- Let me explain. I...
- Go ahead. I'm mopping.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.432
- Maybe I shouldn't bother.
- Maybe you mopn't.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.512
I guess after a while,
you just stop being surprised by people.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.831
Yeah, I'm going to be needing a room.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.514
Who can say no
to 49-cent cheeseburgers?

03:33.600 --> 03:37.229
T ack on the medicine, your room,
and pumping your stomach,

03:37.320 --> 03:41.108
and that 49-cent cheeseburger's
in the neighbourhood of $1,300.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.634
- See, that's how they get you.
- That's right.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.517
- Carla, your brother called.
- Cool.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.592
- You have a brother?
- That's my pet name for Turk.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.558
You know, cos he's mine,
and he's a black man, my brother.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.757
That is adorable.
Think he'd mind if I call him that too?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.673
- JD, I was kidding.
- I know.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.115
But I'm still gonna ask.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.475
So how come I know nothing
about your family?

04:02.560 --> 04:06.269
I don't know. I'm just not big
on sharing my personal life with people.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.113
But you know everything about me.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.589
You even know I have them
switch Lauren's shifts

04:11.680 --> 04:13.477
so we always end up working together.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.152
- I didn't know that.
- You do now.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.552
- Because I'm sharing with you.
- OK, I'm leaving now.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.755
- Well...
- Another Friday night?

04:21.839 --> 04:24.479
- That's three in a row!
- I know. It's so unfair.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.676
I'm mad about it.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.514
Bonnie is killing me. I cannot beat
this woman no matter what I try.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.592
- She's like a ninja, but worse.
- Nothing's worse than a ninja.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.716
They're masters
of every style of combat.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.156
Can we please talk about something
other than Bonnie?

04:42.240 --> 04:44.071
You should give Bonnie a break.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.310
It's really hard being
a woman around here.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.709
You walk through walls
and nobody notices you.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.394
Not entirely unlike a ninja.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.311
Whatever. I'm out.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.436
Catch you later, my brother.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.469
- I'll holler.
- He said "holler."

05:03.280 --> 05:06.272
Mr Tillman's results are back.
It's bad.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.670
Dammit, Laverne,
why can't I ever be the one dying?

05:09.760 --> 05:12.752
- I don't know.
- It was rhetorical.

05:12.840 --> 05:16.435
Tell Mrs Tillman I'll be right out.
That would be terrific.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.273
- Mr Tillman is my patient too.
- He is?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.794
I was in the room with you
this morning, remember?

05:23.040 --> 05:24.029
No.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.391
Well, I was. Anyway, if you want,
I could talk to his wife.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.789
Because I just really enjoy
that kind of stuff.

05:31.880 --> 05:35.077
Wait a minute. Are you actually
saying you enjoy telling people

05:35.160 --> 05:37.879
their spouses are going to die?

05:37.960 --> 05:40.349
Yep. I mean,
I know that sounds a little bit weird,

05:40.440 --> 05:42.795
but I just really like being there
for people.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.713
It's kind of why I became a doctor
in the first place.

05:45.800 --> 05:49.793
Well, it's nice to know
where the magic began.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.279
There you go.

05:51.360 --> 05:56.070
So, how are my girls today?
Fantastic. Listen...

05:56.160 --> 05:58.799
If you're here to do one of your
"How are my girls today,

05:58.880 --> 06:01.952
now let me tell you some things
you don't want to hear" routines,

06:02.040 --> 06:04.554
I'm in a mood, so it's probably
in your best interest

06:04.640 --> 06:06.471
to make up some lame excuse and leave.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.473
Young lady,
I will not be spoken to like that.

06:10.560 --> 06:15.634
Luckily for you, I have to go see
Miss Fitzstrafoler.

06:15.720 --> 06:19.599
- Attaboy.
- Rough day, huh?

06:19.680 --> 06:23.309
Well, maybe it would help
to share with someone.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.678
OK, you want in?
You want me to open up?

06:27.760 --> 06:31.230
- I think I can handle it.
- Fine.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.914
I don't like the way I look,
I don't like the way I think,

06:34.000 --> 06:35.991
or the way I feel
about how I look and think.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.753
I have too much hair,
my boobs are too low,

06:38.840 --> 06:41.035
my butt is too big,
and I am too short.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.033
Plus, I woke up and cried because
I thought I was getting wrinkles,

06:45.120 --> 06:48.954
but it turns out I just fell asleep
on Turk's corduroy pants.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.998
There. Now you think
I'm the craziest woman here.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.318
Dr Cox let me tell a woman
that her husband's dying.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.592
No, I don't.

07:02.680 --> 07:06.229
Huh. So I'm doing
a nissen gastric fundoplication,

07:06.320 --> 07:10.836
and you're doing
yet another appendectomy.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.878
- How fun for you.
- You call that smack talk?

07:13.960 --> 07:16.428
You should ask how it feels
to be so far below you

07:16.520 --> 07:18.511
I wouldn't be able to read
"Suck it, Turk"

07:18.600 --> 07:21.956
if you wrote it
on the bottom of your shoe.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.270
OK. How does that feel?

07:24.360 --> 07:25.918
- Damn.
- Doctors.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.434
Something I've taken
great pride in over the years

07:28.520 --> 07:29.999
is Sacred Heart's involvement

07:30.080 --> 07:32.719
in the esteemed "Doctors
Without Borders" programme.

07:32.800 --> 07:37.430
Now, every year I single out
the most qualified surgical resident

07:37.520 --> 07:40.637
to accompany me
to Mexico for a weekend.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.429
- Anyway, I've made my decision.
- Thank you, sir.

07:44.520 --> 07:48.479
You haven't lived
until you've tasted El Todd's guac.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.074
Dr Turk, pack your bag.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.872
- Shove it, Turk!
- I'm gonna shove it,

08:04.960 --> 08:07.679
and love it,
and dance around above it.

08:07.760 --> 08:10.194
Hey, shove it, and love it

08:10.280 --> 08:12.157
And dance around above it
Come on.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.869
You see,
that's what's really bothering me.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.713
What? Turk and Bonnie?
They hate each other.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.837
Then why's he doing his
"You're getting a piece of this" dance?

08:21.920 --> 08:24.559
He's not. That's his
"ln your face" dance.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.949
Or it's his
"There's a sale on lotion" dance.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.917
I don't know.
He's got so many dances.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.197
Please, they might as well
be naked. Slut.

08:32.280 --> 08:36.592
Carla. Trust me, there's no way
that he's cheating on you.

08:36.679 --> 08:40.592
Yeah, you're probably right.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.830
Wait, that's it?
You were just freaking out.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.229
Hey, you wanted in.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.399
Crazy.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.432
- Barbie.
- Yessie?

08:50.520 --> 08:54.798
- How'd it go with Mrs Tillman?
- It was awesome.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.791
It's not possessed.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.189
- It's for sitting.
- Excuse me?

09:02.280 --> 09:04.919
For God's sake, you must park it.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.319
Of course,
what we generally do now is eat. Eat.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.751
I can't. I'm too nervous.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.509
Christopher.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.353
Sorry, sir. I just can't believe
Kelso chose me.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.078
Yeah, me neither.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.913
- I told him to take Bonnie.
- So, then, why'd he pick me?

09:31.000 --> 09:35.073
Among all the surgery residents, what's
the difference between you, Bonnie,

09:35.160 --> 09:37.594
Todd, Steve, Erik, and Vijay?

09:37.680 --> 09:40.035
- First of all, she's a...
- There it is.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.712
- Wait. Because she...
- Yep.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.155
- She?
- Exactly.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.791
It's because she's a woman. Damn!

09:54.000 --> 09:57.197
Fork. Me can't eat soup!

10:00.080 --> 10:02.469
Look, I don't think you're stupid, OK?

10:02.560 --> 10:04.596
Your job requires a lot of know-how.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.990
It's not like you're ladling out
sloppy joes or something.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.197
You know, my uncle
was a "joer." Yeah.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.551
Troy, let me fill you in on this guy.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.232
JD.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.276
Oh, thank God.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.999
A lot happens in the cafeteria.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.833
Whether you've accidentally
just stolen your lunch,

10:25.920 --> 10:28.992
or you've finally gotten
someone to notice you.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.390
Or you've connected with a friend
on a level you didn 't know you could.

10:32.480 --> 10:36.029
The cafeteria is just a happy place.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.269
What's wrong with him?

10:37.360 --> 10:40.352
I'm only going to Mexico
cos Bonnie's not a guy.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.793
I'm sorry, baby.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.474
I can't believe you think
I got a thing for her.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.152
Oh, no.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.276
Who told you that?

10:59.520 --> 11:01.238
JD told you that?

11:01.320 --> 11:03.231
When did you guys learn sign language?

11:04.520 --> 11:08.069
Night classes?
Wait, when did I learn sign language?

11:08.160 --> 11:12.358
JD said you're a big old can of crazy.

11:12.440 --> 11:16.479
A little can. A very tiny, small can.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.632
No, you said "big can".

11:24.600 --> 11:27.068
Mr Hogan, I've come up
with a little mantra for you.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.720
- Hit me.
- "lf meat is your treat,

11:29.800 --> 11:32.678
your oesophageal varices
will bleed into your intestines,

11:32.760 --> 11:34.796
Ieading to a horrible, horrible death."

11:34.880 --> 11:37.348
- Catchy.
- Say it over and over again.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.591
Horrible, horrible death.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.272
OK, you can fix this.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.396
Carla, look,
I messed up and I'm so sorry.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.472
Bambi, we're good, OK? We're pals.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.549
Oh, thank you.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.029
You think it's funny
to switch people's shifts?

11:51.120 --> 11:52.838
Bye, pal.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.434
I missed my baby's first steps.

11:55.520 --> 11:59.672
I'm so sorry.
Does this mean you're married?

12:02.680 --> 12:05.672
- Can I bother you for a second?
- Based on history, I'd say yes.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.478
I know Dr Wen recommended Bonnie.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.269
I chose you over that nice young lady
because we're going to be moving around.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.316
I can't be pulling over
every two minutes

12:13.400 --> 12:16.039
for pee-pee stops and nylons
that come in plastic eggs.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.714
Dr Kelso, don't you think
that's a little sexist?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.233
I don't know, sport.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.118
Is it sexist
to hold the door for a woman?

12:23.200 --> 12:26.715
Is it sexist to keep the pretty nurses
and unload a few uggos?

12:26.800 --> 12:30.395
The rules have changed so much,
I just can't keep up.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.597
Tell you what, let's stop jiggling
each other's marbles.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.672
You decide who should go.
That way, when you choose yourself,

12:36.760 --> 12:40.309
I won't have to deal
with all this horrible guilt.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.877
- Dr Cox!
- Jeez, Edith.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.598
Hi.

12:50.560 --> 12:53.358
This chair won't pull out.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.830
Maybe that's because
my ankles are wrapped around it.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.593
Look, I actually need some "me time."

13:00.480 --> 13:02.789
- Yeah.
- OK.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.077
I just wanted to say if you had
any other bad-news situations,

13:10.160 --> 13:12.196
I would gladly handle them for you.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.919
- Really?
- Gladly.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.869
Well, welcome aboard.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.674
Why would you get turkey
when there's egg salad?

13:32.760 --> 13:34.990
Dude, there's no egg salad today.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.593
You missed a spot.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.359
- So we're even, right?
- Even?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.271
I told a nurse you switched her shift.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.157
You babbled all my crazy to the person

13:53.240 --> 13:55.231
I plan on spending
the rest of my life with.

13:55.320 --> 13:58.232
I could spend the rest of my
life with Lauren, or her tushie.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.073
I just want to wash it. Is that weird?

14:01.160 --> 14:03.515
- You think this is funny?
- Come on.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.876
I told you how hard it is for me
to let my guard down.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.396
And that quick you burn me.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.675
- Never again.
- Well, don't walk away.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.671
Carla, come on.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.037
Bonnie, I found out that Dr Wen
actually recommended you

14:21.120 --> 14:23.554
for that trip to Mexico.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.359
I'm sure you know how hard it is
for me to admit that to you,

14:26.440 --> 14:29.477
so I was hoping that we can use this
as an opportunity

14:29.560 --> 14:32.199
to repair our relationship.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.191
What do you say?

14:38.360 --> 14:42.558
Oh, my God. OK, fine.
Look, you go to Mexico, OK?

14:42.640 --> 14:45.438
And by the way, dolor en el asno
means "pain in the ass."

14:45.520 --> 14:48.193
I thought it would help you
when you introduce yourself.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.350
I don't want your charity.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.635
You go, and every second
you're down there,

14:52.720 --> 14:54.711
I want you to think
about how I kick your ass

14:54.800 --> 14:58.349
up and down these halls all day long.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.557
Now, where was l?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.191
Oh, yeah.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.998
There you go, prom queen.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.150
There is some really tragic stuff
in there,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.356
so, you know, go nuts.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.238
All of these are your patients?

15:13.320 --> 15:15.788
No. But when word got out
about your little offer,

15:15.880 --> 15:17.677
a bunch of other docs wanted in.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.354
Oh, great. More for me.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.675
I'm afraid you have hepatitis.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.511
Meningitis.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.152
Esophogeo-gastro-duodeno-colitis.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.949
Yes, it's like being blind in one eye...

15:41.040 --> 15:43.634
except you'll be blind in both.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.431
I'm really sorry.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.909
There's nothing more
that we can do.

15:55.960 --> 15:59.669
Hello! We can hear you! Hello!

15:59.760 --> 16:02.320
- Why won't it stop ringing?
- Hello!

16:02.400 --> 16:05.278
- For the love of God, hello!
- All right, look.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.318
OK, I never meant to insinuate
you guys were stupid, all right?

16:08.400 --> 16:10.868
Everyone knows
you're a hundred times smarter

16:10.960 --> 16:13.155
than the jackasses
that run this place.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.835
- Is that so, sport?
- No, sir. It's not so.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.638
Would you just go ahead
and answer it already? Hello?

16:21.720 --> 16:23.836
Hello?

16:26.880 --> 16:29.110
Hey, take that, smart guy.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.839
Troy, that's not how we do it.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.356
- Mr Hogan, what the hell?
- What would you do

16:36.440 --> 16:39.432
if your five-year-old begged you
to have a bite of his dinner?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.556
- You had two dozen ribs.
- I know.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.279
- I don't even have a kid.
- That's it. I've had enough.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.715
- This is ridiculous.
- Will you lay off Mr Hogan?

16:46.800 --> 16:49.189
So he made a mistake.
People make mistakes.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.953
It wouldn't hurt you to cut 'em
some slack once in a while.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.996
- Thanks, man.
- This isn't about you.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.638
Don't eat meat. Carla.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.553
Every time you screwed up with me,
I've let you off the hook.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.598
When have I ever screwed up with you?

17:01.680 --> 17:03.955
OK, never, but we both know
that if you ever did,

17:04.040 --> 17:05.758
I would give you a break.

17:05.839 --> 17:09.116
Now, let's see how you like it
when I walk away from you.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.710
Actually, I need to go this way.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.237
Right the first time.

17:26.040 --> 17:29.874
- Awesome.
- You're gonna love this one.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.794
25-year-old woman, dancer, actually.
Well, not anymore.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.553
We had to take both of her legs.
Bilateral gangrene.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.949
And seeing as her husband
recently passed away,

17:39.040 --> 17:41.076
and her insurance at the dancers' union

17:41.160 --> 17:43.754
probably is not going to cover it,
you should tell her

17:43.840 --> 17:46.638
she won't be able to stay
here with us for her rehab.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.598
What room is she in?

17:49.680 --> 17:53.514
There is no room.
In fact, in the history of medicine,

17:53.600 --> 17:56.876
there's never actually been
a patient that depressing.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.712
I made her up!
Come on, now, Barbie.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.598
Keep going down this road,
you're gonna go up to the roof

18:01.680 --> 18:03.272
and jump the hell off.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.191
Mind you, it's only five stories high,

18:05.280 --> 18:08.317
so you'll just wind up back down here,
where I will treat you.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.391
Then I'll be forced
to jump off the roof,

18:10.480 --> 18:13.358
which, as I was suggesting to you,
is only five stories high.

18:13.440 --> 18:17.115
And are you starting to see
a pattern forming here?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.714
I just wanted to be colleagues.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.997
Barbie, as long as you stay
and work at this hospital,

18:23.080 --> 18:25.071
I'm always gonna be your superior.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.991
That's just the way it goes.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.072
Don't get me wrong,
you can keep trying to connect with me.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.311
I mean, hell,
you're so damn entertaining,

18:33.400 --> 18:35.470
you just might make some headway.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.835
But still, you might be better served,

18:37.920 --> 18:41.754
and this is a crazy notion,
if you could stop worrying so much

18:41.840 --> 18:45.594
about who does
and doesn't notice you.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.750
Even for a second.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.229
That'd be good.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.276
That'd be real good.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.272
I think every day
is made up of tiny little tests.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.831
Some are tests of character.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.275
Some are tests of fortitude.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.271
Others are tests of friendship.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.992
- I spoke to my brother today.
- Really?

19:20.920 --> 19:23.309
He's having some problems.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.198
And if you're lucky,
when it really matters,

19:26.280 --> 19:29.511
you'll pass with flying colours.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.951
Hola, K-Dog.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.996
Yeah! Full bar!

19:36.680 --> 19:38.875
T ake us to Mexico!
