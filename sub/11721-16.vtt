I didn't do that.

03:47.753 --> 03:49.920
But I was thinking maybe
that clothes could be optional

03:49.922 --> 03:51.755

03:51.757 --> 03:54.358
Huh.
Huh?

Yeah?
Yeah.

03:57.263 --> 03:59.596
It's good to see you.
You, too.

04:06.272 --> 04:09.940
Brother, you're playing what
we like to call military golf.

04:15.413 --> 04:17.147

you're swinging like a gorilla.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.152
Don't you remember what I said
in the parking lot?

04:22.154 --> 04:23.921
This is a game of finesse.

04:23.923 --> 04:25.956
The easier you swing,

04:25.958 --> 04:27.624
the further that little
white ball goes.

04:27.626 --> 04:29.893
Okay, that doesn't make
any sense to me.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.296
See if this makes sense.

04:32.298 --> 04:33.730
You see that
little white thing

04:33.732 --> 04:35.732
way out there in
the middle of the fairway?

04:35.734 --> 04:37.301
Yes, Lou.
That's my ball.

04:37.303 --> 04:39.002
That's swinging easy.

04:39.004 --> 04:40.637
Now, where's your ball?

04:40.639 --> 04:42.239
I'll tell you where
your ball is--

04:42.241 --> 04:44.575
all the way at the bottom
of that little pond.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.543

No, no, that's not the reason
why I came over.

05:25.251 --> 05:26.984
- What's the matter with you?
- If you don't mind,

05:26.986 --> 05:28.118
I just want to give you a tip.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.319
I just saw something
from back there.

05:29.321 --> 05:31.188
Oh, I would... yes, please.

05:31.190 --> 05:32.489
By all means, yeah,
especially if it's free.

05:32.491 --> 05:34.191
His motto is, "If it's for free,
then it's for me."

05:34.193 --> 05:35.892
Please, go ahead.
I'd-I'd appreciate it.

05:35.894 --> 05:37.461
Thank you very much.
Yeah, of course.

05:37.463 --> 05:38.895
I just saw from back there...
Okay.

05:38.897 --> 05:40.764
maybe just want to go
a little bit more behind,

05:40.766 --> 05:42.032
widen your stance a little bit.

05:42.034 --> 05:43.734
Like, further away
from the ball?

05:43.736 --> 05:44.901
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

05:44.903 --> 05:47.337
Perfect.
Just bend your knees.

05:47.339 --> 05:48.872
How's that, yeah?
Yep, great. Looks great.

05:48.874 --> 05:50.407
And then, now, just keep your head down,
Okay.

05:50.409 --> 05:52.576
keep your eyes on the ball
and just swing through.

05:52.578 --> 05:54.745
Okay, and swing through.
Mm-hmm.

05:57.081 --> 05:58.949
What the hell...?

Wow, see?
You're a natural.

Uh, you know what,
if my current job

06:13.299 --> 06:14.631
doesn't work out,
then I'll think about it.

06:14.633 --> 06:15.799
Yeah, you should think about it.
Yeah.

U.S. Open champion.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.284

06:34.286 --> 06:36.219
Yeah. Seriously.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.121

were drooling, huh?

06:38.123 --> 06:40.257
I wasn't drooling.

06:40.259 --> 06:41.291
I was just
admiring how...

06:41.293 --> 06:42.826
a professional
golfer like that

06:42.828 --> 06:46.330
would take the time with
a charity case like yourself.

06:46.332 --> 06:48.231
I'm sorry, are you done?

06:48.233 --> 06:51.201
Because you see that
little white ball

06:51.203 --> 06:54.071
out there on the fairway,
that's much closer to the hole

06:54.073 --> 06:56.606
than your little white ball.

06:56.608 --> 06:58.408
It looks like
it's getting lonely...

06:58.410 --> 06:59.743
Do me a favor,
answer that

06:59.745 --> 07:01.511
so I don't have to hear
any more of this.

07:01.513 --> 07:03.046
McGarrett.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.148
Thanks again.
See you around.

07:10.422 --> 07:12.322
Hey, what do we got?
So, we have a confirmed arson.

07:12.324 --> 07:13.357
Two fatalities.

07:13.359 --> 07:16.326
Young couple,
Sabina and Hagan Mahoe.

07:16.328 --> 07:18.295
They didn't stand a chance.

07:18.297 --> 07:19.463
What do you mean?

07:19.465 --> 07:21.865
Well, all the windows have
security bars on them,

07:21.867 --> 07:23.200
but the front and back doors

07:23.202 --> 07:24.401
were secured from the outside

07:24.403 --> 07:26.002
with a wood plank
screwed to them.

07:26.004 --> 07:27.337
Huh.

07:27.339 --> 07:28.872
So it's premeditated, then.

07:28.874 --> 07:30.073
Yeah, looks that way.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.175
Why is there nobody
inside processing?

07:32.177 --> 07:34.478
Yeah... about that.

07:37.348 --> 07:38.648
Excuse me...

07:38.650 --> 07:40.417

don't touch anything,

07:46.892 --> 07:48.358

Mm, that's where

08:07.713 --> 08:10.647

10:11.512 --> 10:13.246
Danny's Amber?

10:13.248 --> 10:14.714
You sure about that?

10:14.716 --> 10:16.650
He had a picture
with them together.

10:16.652 --> 10:18.451
They looked pretty cozy, brah.

10:18.453 --> 10:20.787
You think
she's stepping out on Danny?

10:20.789 --> 10:23.089
Uh...

10:23.091 --> 10:24.891
I don't know; I'll look into it.

10:24.893 --> 10:26.426
Did you get a last name?

10:26.428 --> 10:29.563
No, but I took a picture of the
perp's ride as he drove away.

10:29.565 --> 10:31.731
The perp? Now he's the perp?

10:31.733 --> 10:33.500
Hey, that's my
professional opinion, partner.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.534
Mm-hmm.

10:34.536 --> 10:36.303
Picture's on its way.

10:36.305 --> 10:39.239
If you need any more assistance,
you know where to reach me.

10:44.512 --> 10:46.613
Okay, this is where the
accelerant was poured.

10:46.615 --> 10:48.081
It extended around
the entire room

10:48.083 --> 10:49.549
and then across into the center,

10:49.551 --> 10:51.418
where the fire started.

10:55.256 --> 10:56.890
It's not gasoline.
No,

10:56.892 --> 10:57.924
it's liquid petroleum.

10:57.926 --> 10:59.726
It's used in camping stoves.

10:59.728 --> 11:01.328
Fire bugs call it white gas.

11:01.330 --> 11:03.263
The fumes are less volatile
than gasoline,

11:03.265 --> 11:05.999
making it less likely
that our torch

11:06.001 --> 11:07.634
would injure himself
when setting the fire.

11:07.636 --> 11:08.802
This guy really knew his stuff.

11:08.804 --> 11:10.937
You have no idea.

11:22.917 --> 11:24.451
Your first fire
was five days ago.

11:24.453 --> 11:25.752
Vacant house a few blocks away.

11:25.754 --> 11:27.921
Second fire, two days ago.

11:27.923 --> 11:30.924
Family was away on vacation.

11:30.926 --> 11:33.093
Now, HPD arson guys
uploaded these cases

11:33.095 --> 11:36.363
onto the national TAPS database;
I linked them to the fires

11:36.365 --> 11:38.531
in California.
All right, so the pour pattern

11:38.533 --> 11:41.034
and the use of white gas
is this guy's signature.

11:41.036 --> 11:42.047
Yeah.

11:42.071 --> 11:43.804
Camera part
of the signature, too?

11:43.805 --> 11:45.272
No. That's something new.

11:45.274 --> 11:47.407
And when he started
in California,

11:47.409 --> 11:50.343
he went for vacant homes,
abandoned buildings.

11:50.345 --> 11:54.180
But then, as time went on,
he evolved.

11:54.182 --> 11:56.650
The last three arsons
in my county

11:56.652 --> 11:58.918
were similar to this one--

11:58.920 --> 12:01.388
a single-story home,

12:01.390 --> 12:04.524
bars on the windows,
doors secured from the outside,

12:04.526 --> 12:07.861
victims trapped on the inside.
So we're looking for someone

12:07.863 --> 12:09.562
who recently moved to Oahu?

12:09.564 --> 12:10.897
Not necessarily.

12:10.899 --> 12:13.466
The torch we're looking for
was active in California

12:13.468 --> 12:14.801
for about three years.

12:14.803 --> 12:16.369
Then, two years ago,

12:16.371 --> 12:17.871
the fires suddenly stopped.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.440
Now he shows up here.

12:20.442 --> 12:22.609
Any idea why he
took a break?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.811
Maybe he got locked up
for something else.

12:24.813 --> 12:26.413
I don't think so.

12:26.415 --> 12:29.082
This guy is too good,
too careful.

12:29.084 --> 12:30.717
Any number of triggers

12:30.719 --> 12:33.019
could have made him stop
and start again.

12:33.021 --> 12:34.688
But now that

12:34.690 --> 12:36.690
he's taken lives
and gotten away with it,

12:36.692 --> 12:39.859
he's not gonna stop again
until <i>he</i> decides to move on.

12:39.861 --> 12:42.295
What else
can you tell us about him?

12:42.297 --> 12:43.930
<i>The torch we're looking for</i>

12:43.932 --> 12:47.400
<i>is someone who's able to</i>
<i>function normally in society.</i>

12:47.402 --> 12:49.669
<i>On the surface, there's</i>
<i>nothing remarkable about him.</i>

12:49.671 --> 12:52.939
<i>He's disarming, personable,</i>

12:52.941 --> 12:55.308
<i>may even be charming.</i>

12:55.310 --> 12:56.443
Hi.
Hi.

12:56.445 --> 12:58.345
I'm a licensed
exterminator.

12:58.347 --> 12:59.646
I'm doing a job up the street.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.614
It's been a really bad year
with all the rain,

13:01.616 --> 13:02.916
especially for older homes
like yours.

13:02.918 --> 13:04.517
Since I was in
the neighborhood,

13:04.519 --> 13:06.119
I thought I'd
offer folks

13:06.121 --> 13:08.321
a free,
no-obligation inspection.

13:08.323 --> 13:10.557
He's persistent and persuasive.

13:10.559 --> 13:12.926
Well, even if you don't
see them, they can be there.

13:12.928 --> 13:16.262
Get ahead of it now, you save
yourself a ton of money in the future.

13:16.264 --> 13:18.631
Like I said, it's free.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.500
All right...
<i>He targets victims</i>

13:20.502 --> 13:21.735
<i>who are young and attractive,</i>

13:21.737 --> 13:23.737
<i>whose lifestyle and happiness</i>
<i>he envies.</i>

13:23.739 --> 13:28.041
<i>He then manages to ingratiate</i>
<i>himself somehow...</i>

13:28.043 --> 13:31.678
<i>gets inside their homes,</i>
<i>studies the layout...</i>

13:36.450 --> 13:37.751
Awesome.
Thank you.

13:37.753 --> 13:39.219
Thank you so much.
You have yourself a great day.

13:39.221 --> 13:41.254
<i>This interaction with his</i>
<i>victims is the final step</i>

13:41.256 --> 13:43.089
<i>to determining</i>
<i>if they will die.</i>

14:26.973 --> 14:29.541
Well, you were right.

14:31.010 --> 14:33.178
My being right
didn't save these people.

14:33.180 --> 14:35.280
I get a feeling
this is more

14:35.282 --> 14:37.316
than just a
collar for you.

14:39.486 --> 14:41.153
Looks like our guy escaped

14:41.155 --> 14:43.288
through a trapdoor
in the laundry room,

14:43.290 --> 14:45.691
that led to a crawlspace
under the house.

14:45.693 --> 14:47.526
This guy knew this place
inside and out.

14:47.528 --> 14:49.528
We need to canvass
the whole area,

14:49.530 --> 14:51.130
see if anyone saw anything.

14:51.132 --> 14:54.366
Yeah, HPD's on it, and we got
CSU searching for a camera.

14:54.368 --> 14:57.336
He didn't use one this time.

15:07.046 --> 15:08.881
What is that?

15:08.883 --> 15:11.984
A fire retardant gel-- it's
sprayed on the outside of homes

15:11.986 --> 15:14.720
that are in the pathway
of an oncoming brushfire.

15:16.623 --> 15:19.057
He stood right here.

15:27.501 --> 15:30.536
Help!
We need help! Help!

15:30.538 --> 15:33.205
He wanted to be in the room...

15:33.207 --> 15:35.674
when these people were dying.

16:00.733 --> 16:02.301
Hey.

16:04.204 --> 16:05.504
Good morning.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.778
Somebody had a rough night
last night.

16:12.780 --> 16:14.947
Come here.

16:14.949 --> 16:15.881
Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:15.883 --> 16:17.115
I was, uh...
Oh!

16:17.117 --> 16:19.751
Ooh...

16:19.753 --> 16:21.153
Sorry if I woke you up.

16:21.155 --> 16:22.654
I was just, um...

16:22.656 --> 16:23.922
couldn't sleep,
kept walking around.

16:23.924 --> 16:26.391
I came out here, it was like
3:00 in the morning

16:26.393 --> 16:27.759
and I fell asleep out here.

16:27.761 --> 16:30.028
Mm...

16:30.030 --> 16:32.130
Mmm...

16:32.132 --> 16:34.299
Who's Reyes?

16:34.301 --> 16:35.667
Hmm?

16:35.669 --> 16:39.404
You-you mentioned his name
in your sleep last night.

16:39.406 --> 16:41.039
I did?

16:41.041 --> 16:42.875
Yeah.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.343
Marco Reyes.

16:44.345 --> 16:45.444
He's, uh...

16:45.446 --> 16:47.045
he's the guy that
killed my brother.

16:49.015 --> 16:50.616
Oh, Danny, I'm sorry.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.818
I didn't...
It's okay.

16:54.387 --> 16:55.587
It's all right.

16:57.524 --> 16:59.725
What... what
happened to him?

17:02.795 --> 17:04.796
Let's go swimming.
You want to go swimming?

17:06.598 --> 17:08.333
Hmm?

17:08.335 --> 17:10.368
You hate the water.

17:10.371 --> 17:11.970
I don't know if
I hate the water.

17:11.972 --> 17:13.805
But I was just thinking, if you
were wearing something skimpy,

17:13.807 --> 17:15.406
maybe it would be a...

17:15.409 --> 17:17.476
more pleasurable
experience, you know?

17:17.478 --> 17:19.144
Mmm...
Huh?

17:19.146 --> 17:20.746
I'm happy to oblige.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.814
All right, let's go.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.487
Let's go.
Okay.

17:28.489 --> 17:30.155
Wait, come back.
Let's not go yet.

17:30.157 --> 17:32.324
Okay.

17:37.196 --> 17:38.230
Chin.

17:38.232 --> 17:39.531
Hey, what's up?

17:39.533 --> 17:41.233
So that plate
that Kamekona gave you

17:41.235 --> 17:42.668
came back to a car

17:42.670 --> 17:45.671
rented by a Frank Simpson,
out of New York City.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.673
TSA has him landing here
a week ago.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.007
Well, Amber's
from New York City.

17:49.009 --> 17:50.309
Maybe, uh...

17:50.311 --> 17:52.644
maybe this guy's
an old boyfriend or something.

17:52.646 --> 17:53.679
He's more than an old boyfriend.

17:53.681 --> 17:54.813
He's her husband.

17:54.815 --> 17:57.382
Turns out our Amber Vitale
was actually born

17:57.384 --> 17:58.417
Melissa Armstrong.

17:58.419 --> 18:00.886
Her married name
is Melissa Simpson.

18:00.888 --> 18:02.287
She travels 5,000 miles,

18:02.289 --> 18:03.889
she changes her name,

18:03.891 --> 18:05.557
and now the husband shows up?
She had to have been

18:05.559 --> 18:06.625
running from him.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.327
Yeah, and for good reason.

18:08.329 --> 18:09.595
NYPD arrested Simpson
back in 2013

18:09.597 --> 18:11.229
for felony assault.

18:11.231 --> 18:13.565
Amber, AKA Melissa Simpson,

18:13.567 --> 18:14.566
was the complainant victim.

18:14.568 --> 18:16.602
He nearly killed her.

18:16.604 --> 18:18.236
She's got an order
of protection against him.

18:18.238 --> 18:20.038
Yeah, all right.
Well, you and I both know

18:20.040 --> 18:21.707
that thing's not worth
the paper it's written on.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.176
All right?
I bet Amber knew that, too.

18:24.178 --> 18:25.577
Yeah. I tried calling Danny...
and Amber, as well.

18:25.579 --> 18:27.112
Both phones went
straight to voice mail.

18:27.114 --> 18:28.380
Danny told me that he was

18:28.382 --> 18:29.514
going off the grid.

18:29.516 --> 18:30.682
He wants to spend
some time with Amber.

18:30.684 --> 18:32.050
They must have turned
their phones off.

18:32.052 --> 18:33.652
Well, that explains why
I can't ping their location.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.653
He say where he was taking her?

18:34.655 --> 18:35.655
No. No, he didn't.

18:35.656 --> 18:36.755
I'll reach out to friends

18:36.757 --> 18:38.624
and work and see if
anyone knows anything.

18:38.626 --> 18:39.958
Have HPD help.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.159
Put an APB out on Simpson.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.362
If he's going after Amber...

18:43.364 --> 18:46.064
<i>she and Danny</i>
<i>could be in danger.</i>

19:03.650 --> 19:05.117
What is it?

19:05.119 --> 19:06.585
Ball cap.

19:06.587 --> 19:08.387
Everyone's looking
at the house.

19:08.389 --> 19:10.322
He's looking at us.

19:13.159 --> 19:14.359
That's him.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.263
Steve!

19:45.258 --> 19:46.591
Damn it.

19:46.593 --> 19:48.460
He was just here.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.595
You!
Green jacket.

19:50.597 --> 19:51.897
Show me your hands!
Right now!

19:51.899 --> 19:52.964
Put 'em on your head!

19:52.966 --> 19:54.900
Turn around, slowly.

19:58.004 --> 19:58.970
That's not him.

19:58.972 --> 20:02.207
Are you Agent Kathy Millwood?

20:03.609 --> 20:04.743
How do you know my name?

20:04.745 --> 20:06.445
Don't do that!
Do not do that!

20:06.447 --> 20:07.813
Get your hands back
on top of your head!

20:07.815 --> 20:09.614
What's the matter
with you?

20:09.616 --> 20:11.316
Get on your knees.

20:11.318 --> 20:13.685
Your hands.
Give me your hands!

20:16.589 --> 20:18.590
What did he tell you?

20:18.592 --> 20:20.025
Nothing.

20:20.027 --> 20:22.894
He gave me $100
to put on this hat and coat

20:22.896 --> 20:24.396
and he told me to make sure

20:24.398 --> 20:26.531
you got that envelope.
That's it.

20:27.734 --> 20:29.401
What are those?

20:30.236 --> 20:32.404
I said, what are those?

20:44.450 --> 20:46.218
The torch knows you?

20:46.220 --> 20:48.253
Huh?

20:48.255 --> 20:49.554
What are you
not telling us?

20:49.556 --> 20:51.389
What are you not
telling us?

20:51.391 --> 20:52.924
The man we're chasing...

20:52.926 --> 20:55.961
he burned down my house
and he killed my husband.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.764
What?
So how are you still on this case?

20:59.966 --> 21:02.100
I'm not.

21:10.025 --> 21:13.260
<i>The arsonist's desire</i>
<i>to destroy and kill</i>

21:13.262 --> 21:14.262
is born out of

21:14.263 --> 21:16.230
a chronic sexual dysfunction

21:16.232 --> 21:19.300
fueled by feelings of anger,

21:19.302 --> 21:20.968
inadequacy and shame.

21:20.970 --> 21:24.238
His IQ is well below
the normal range.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.708
Fire makes him feel powerful

21:27.710 --> 21:29.477
and in control...

21:29.479 --> 21:31.846
but these feelings
only temporarily mask

21:31.848 --> 21:35.316
the pain of knowing
who he really is:

21:35.318 --> 21:39.120
a weak, frightened coward.

21:44.326 --> 21:45.993
You wanted to antagonize him

21:45.995 --> 21:47.161
so he'd contact you, right?

21:47.163 --> 21:49.663
Yes.
Mm.

21:49.665 --> 21:51.198
And he did.

21:54.970 --> 21:57.938
Two nights later,
he broke into my house

21:57.940 --> 22:00.574
and set the fire
that took my husband's life.

22:04.913 --> 22:07.882
Mitch and I had
gotten into a horrible fight

22:07.884 --> 22:09.884
that night and, um...

22:11.854 --> 22:14.455
...he accused me of being
obsessed with the case

22:14.457 --> 22:17.525
at the expense of our marriage.

22:17.527 --> 22:20.194
He wasn't wrong.

22:20.196 --> 22:22.563
<i>He ended up sleeping</i>
<i>on the couch in our guest room.</i>

22:22.565 --> 22:23.697
Mitchell? Mitch!

22:23.699 --> 22:25.533
<i>About 4:00 a.m.,</i>
<i>the alarm went off, and...</i>

22:25.535 --> 22:26.801
Mitch!

22:26.803 --> 22:28.869
<i>...by the time I got to him,</i>
<i>it was too late.</i>

22:28.871 --> 22:30.037
Mitch?

22:30.039 --> 22:31.972
Come on, baby.

22:36.445 --> 22:39.580
Coroner said he had already
passed from smoke inhalation.

22:42.017 --> 22:44.251
So how did you get out?

22:44.253 --> 22:45.686
Firemen dragged me out.

22:46.988 --> 22:49.223
I didn't want
to leave Mitch in there.

22:54.729 --> 22:57.231
You know, Kathy, I'm...

22:57.233 --> 22:58.966
I am sorry,
I really am.

23:00.936 --> 23:02.636
But you lied to us.

23:03.705 --> 23:05.172
This isn't a job
for you anymore,

23:05.174 --> 23:06.841
you got to see that.
The only reason

23:06.843 --> 23:08.275
you're here
is to take this guy out

23:08.277 --> 23:09.810
and avenge your
husband's death.

23:09.812 --> 23:11.612
No.

23:11.614 --> 23:13.581
I want to stop him.

23:13.583 --> 23:15.082
For what he did to my husband

23:15.084 --> 23:17.418
and for killing
all those other people.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.653
And if the ATF thinks
that's a conflict of interest,

23:19.655 --> 23:21.021
well, then that's too damn bad

23:21.023 --> 23:24.158
because I'm the only one
who's gotten this close.

23:27.863 --> 23:29.563
Yes, I blame myself

23:29.565 --> 23:32.466
for what happened
to my husband...

23:32.468 --> 23:34.635
but, damn it...

23:37.539 --> 23:39.907
...tracking this guy down

23:39.909 --> 23:42.543
is the only thing
that gives me purpose.

23:42.545 --> 23:44.778
Please...

23:44.780 --> 23:48.048
Please don't
take that away from me.

23:52.854 --> 23:54.555
All right.

23:57.325 --> 23:59.226
My boys spoke to one
of Amber's coworkers.

23:59.228 --> 24:01.929
He said that their boss might
know where Amber and Danny are.

24:01.931 --> 24:03.731
He also said that
an old friend of hers

24:03.733 --> 24:05.633
came by the office this morning,
asking the same question.

24:05.635 --> 24:07.101
<i>We're trying to track down</i>
<i>the boss.</i>

24:07.103 --> 24:08.502
<i>As soon as that</i>
<i>information comes in,</i>

24:08.504 --> 24:09.803
<i>I'll get it to you.</i>

24:09.805 --> 24:11.372
<i>All right, well,</i>
<i>let's make it fast, Duke.</i>

24:11.374 --> 24:13.741
<i>Obviously we're not</i>
<i>the only one looking for 'em.</i>

24:21.816 --> 24:23.384
Babe...

24:23.386 --> 24:25.619
whatever you're cooking
smells really good.

24:30.992 --> 24:33.027
Hey.

24:36.565 --> 24:39.533
<i>Hey, so I just</i>
<i>got off the phone with the lab.</i>

24:39.535 --> 24:42.102
Turns out the gel that you guys
recovered from the last scene

24:42.104 --> 24:43.571
only comes in a
powdered form.

24:43.573 --> 24:46.040
It has to be mixed with water
to create the gel.

24:46.042 --> 24:47.675
Well, Fong found
a chemical, cypermethrin,

24:47.677 --> 24:49.109
mixed in with the
recovered sample.

24:49.111 --> 24:52.213
It's a pesticide used
to kill termites.

24:52.215 --> 24:54.014
So wait a minute, the gel
was mixed in a container

24:54.016 --> 24:55.783
that once held the pesticide?
Yeah.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.651
And cypermethrin
is legal for use

24:57.653 --> 24:59.220
only by licensed exterminators.

24:59.222 --> 25:00.854
Wait, so our torch

25:00.856 --> 25:02.489
is an exterminator.

25:02.491 --> 25:04.458
I'm sorry.

25:04.460 --> 25:06.694
Anybody else see
the irony in that?

25:06.696 --> 25:08.429
That's how
he got into their homes,

25:08.431 --> 25:10.030
got to know who
the victims were.

25:10.032 --> 25:11.765
Yeah, so we
cross-referenced names

25:11.767 --> 25:13.100
on purchase orders
with the names

25:13.102 --> 25:15.002
of all the exterminators
on the Island.

25:15.004 --> 25:16.770
And we got a hit.

25:19.374 --> 25:20.441
That's him.

25:20.443 --> 25:22.309
<i>Jason Duclair,</i>

25:22.311 --> 25:23.978
Five-O!

25:30.885 --> 25:32.353
Clear.

25:32.355 --> 25:34.355
Clear.

25:41.963 --> 25:44.331
Well, I guess we found
the arson wing

25:44.333 --> 25:46.300
of the museum.

25:46.302 --> 25:48.535
Guy's proud of his work.

25:52.474 --> 25:54.008
These red pins
must be the homes

25:54.010 --> 25:55.743
he's already torched.

25:55.745 --> 25:56.745
And the yellow ones

25:56.746 --> 25:57.945
must be
the potential targets.

25:57.947 --> 26:01.248
Okay, I'll get HPD Dispatch
to these addresses.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.850
Hold on.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.718
I got an e-mail here,
it's a reservation

26:04.720 --> 26:07.621
for a hotel room tonight
at the Lava Gardens,

26:07.623 --> 26:09.056
room number 2104.

26:09.058 --> 26:11.725
Well, that... that's just
three miles down the road.

26:11.727 --> 26:13.560
Why would he need
a room there?

26:13.562 --> 26:17.097
Because he's gonna go for
something big this time.

26:17.099 --> 26:19.867
<i>That hotel's his next target.</i>

26:28.076 --> 26:30.311
Hey, how you doing?
Hey.

26:32.647 --> 26:35.449
Enjoy your stay.

26:35.451 --> 26:37.618
Thanks.

27:12.621 --> 27:15.489
Frank, please!

27:15.491 --> 27:16.990
Do you love him?

27:16.992 --> 27:18.359
Answer me!

27:18.361 --> 27:20.794
Do you love him?!

27:20.796 --> 27:23.630
Frank, please...

27:29.371 --> 27:31.805
All I wanted to do was
take care of you.

27:31.807 --> 27:33.107
To love you!

27:34.442 --> 27:36.176
Love me?

27:36.178 --> 27:38.011
You put me in the
hospital twice, Frank.

27:38.013 --> 27:39.980
Oh, I know...
I know I did, baby.

27:39.982 --> 27:42.282
I made a mistake.

27:42.284 --> 27:44.985
I told you I was
sorry about that.

27:44.987 --> 27:46.086
Put the knife down.

27:46.088 --> 27:48.622
Put the knife down,
Frank, please.

27:48.624 --> 27:51.058
I want to.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.927
But I can't.

27:54.996 --> 27:58.132
I need you to tell me
that you still love me.

28:01.469 --> 28:02.870
I can't.

28:02.872 --> 28:06.540
I can't... anymore.

28:06.542 --> 28:08.909
I can't...
Why not?

28:08.911 --> 28:12.346
Why not? Because of him?

28:12.348 --> 28:15.749
You're gonna tell me
that you love him?

28:15.751 --> 28:18.419
Because I didn't
fly 5,000 miles

28:18.421 --> 28:21.155
for you to tell me
that it's over!

28:23.292 --> 28:24.425
Danny!

28:26.662 --> 28:27.861
Danny!

28:38.773 --> 28:40.140
Danny!

28:40.142 --> 28:42.376
Danny, stop!

28:42.378 --> 28:43.710
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

28:48.950 --> 28:51.151
I got you.

28:54.622 --> 28:56.790
Okay.

28:58.526 --> 28:59.793
Keep pressure on it.
All right.

28:59.795 --> 29:03.530
I'm gonna get
you to the hospital, okay?

29:16.212 --> 29:17.411
Where do you think you're going?

29:17.413 --> 29:20.514
You can't run from me!

29:52.447 --> 29:54.047
All right, Kathy...

29:54.049 --> 29:55.649
you stay down here, all right?

29:55.651 --> 29:57.251
Coordinate the evac
with HPD and Fire.

29:57.253 --> 29:58.785
Okay. Be careful.

29:58.787 --> 29:59.987
Yeah. Let's move.

30:05.660 --> 30:07.494
Clear.

30:07.496 --> 30:08.762
Clear.

30:11.933 --> 30:13.000
Where the hell is he?

30:13.002 --> 30:14.935
Well, the front desk said

30:14.937 --> 30:16.837
he definitely
checked in to this room.

30:16.839 --> 30:18.272
Well, something's off.

30:24.979 --> 30:27.314
Jason!

30:56.322 --> 30:57.922
<i>Hi. This is Kathy.</i>

30:57.924 --> 30:59.190
<i>Leave a message.</i>

30:59.192 --> 31:01.726
Kathy's not answering.

31:01.728 --> 31:03.361
There's got to be
another room.

31:06.398 --> 31:10.301
I know there's a part
of you that's afraid.

31:13.272 --> 31:16.040
Part of you that just
wants this all to end.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.642
Yeah, that's why you stopped

31:17.644 --> 31:21.546
and went away after you tried
to kill me the first time.

31:21.548 --> 31:23.448
Isn't that right, Jason?

31:32.091 --> 31:33.224
Hi. This is Kathy.

31:33.226 --> 31:34.359
Nothing.

31:34.361 --> 31:36.461
She's still not
answering her phone.

31:36.463 --> 31:37.562
HPD and Fire haven't seen her.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.264
Guys, look at this.

31:40.599 --> 31:41.966
It's blood and it's fresh.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.535
Well, that other room theory's

31:43.537 --> 31:44.903
looking pretty good.

31:44.905 --> 31:47.839
All right, we need
to check every floor.

31:55.915 --> 31:56.948
Next.

31:56.950 --> 31:58.283
Up, up, up, up.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.998
There's our matching
blood trail.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.804
The police know who you are.

32:19.806 --> 32:20.872
They're here.

32:20.874 --> 32:23.975
You're never gonna get away.

32:26.211 --> 32:29.981
Don't you see,
Agent Millwood?

32:29.983 --> 32:32.951
I never planned to leave.

32:32.953 --> 32:35.920
I'm right where I want to be.

32:35.922 --> 32:38.222
I've been waiting for you.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.197
You don't have to do this.

32:47.266 --> 32:50.768
No, I do.

32:50.770 --> 32:54.806
We have to finish
what we started.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.787
You already killed my husband.

33:09.789 --> 33:11.956
There's nothing that can be
more painful than that.

33:11.958 --> 33:15.026
Jason, do you hear me?

33:15.028 --> 33:17.195
Jason?

33:35.381 --> 33:38.116
You have no idea how close
you were to catching me,

33:38.118 --> 33:40.084
Agent Millwood.

33:40.086 --> 33:43.221
We could've been
famous together.

33:44.623 --> 33:48.559
But then you went on TV and
told those lies about me.

33:50.295 --> 33:51.562
I told the truth.

33:51.564 --> 33:53.765
You called me
an uneducated deviant.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.434
And look now.

33:56.436 --> 33:58.803
Here you are, at my mercy.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.374
Who's the smart one now?

34:05.444 --> 34:06.711
Oh, God!

34:06.713 --> 34:08.612
Oh, God...

34:09.481 --> 34:11.581
Before we die,
I want you to know

34:11.583 --> 34:14.418
I have no remorse
for what I'm doing.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.719
Burning people and things

34:15.722 --> 34:19.623
is the only real pleasure
I found on this earth.

34:26.532 --> 34:29.634
I can only pray that death
is no worse than this life.

34:29.636 --> 34:32.003
Oh, my God!

34:36.775 --> 34:37.942
I got him!

34:37.944 --> 34:39.577
Grover, now!

34:46.752 --> 34:49.954
Gotcha. Gotcha.
Thank you.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.757
All right, I got him.

34:52.759 --> 34:54.025
You clear?

34:55.628 --> 34:56.994
On your back, on your back.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.297
On your knees.

34:59.299 --> 35:01.199
Wait, look at me.

35:01.201 --> 35:03.101
Look at me, you son of a bitch!

35:05.771 --> 35:06.871
I promise you

35:06.873 --> 35:08.873
you'll get exactly
what you want someday.

35:08.875 --> 35:10.074
You will burn in Hell.

35:10.076 --> 35:12.210
Let's go.

35:23.123 --> 35:25.823
McGarrett.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.026
What?

35:29.028 --> 35:30.995
When?

35:30.997 --> 35:32.830
How bad is it?

35:39.638 --> 35:41.405
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

35:41.407 --> 35:43.608
I should've told him.

35:44.443 --> 35:45.743
He's in Recovery.

35:45.745 --> 35:48.379
It may take a little time,
but he's gonna be okay.

35:48.381 --> 35:50.281
He's gonna be all right?
He's gonna be all right.

35:50.283 --> 35:51.649
Thank you.
You're welcome...

35:51.651 --> 35:53.017
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

35:53.019 --> 35:54.619
Take good care of him.
All right.

36:07.132 --> 36:09.667
I didn't have much
of a family as a kid.

36:11.003 --> 36:14.372
And when I was 19,
I met Frank.

36:14.374 --> 36:17.675
And he was older
and charming and...

36:19.178 --> 36:22.079
he was the first man
who ever made me feel special.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.982
A year later,
we were married,

36:24.984 --> 36:28.719
and everything changed.

36:28.721 --> 36:31.956
He wanted to control
every aspect of my life.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.495
And when I stood up for myself,
he got violent.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.465
One night, he, uh,

36:41.467 --> 36:45.002
he almost killed me,
so I-I...

36:45.004 --> 36:49.774
left the city and ran as fast
and far away as I could.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.945
And then I met you.

36:56.149 --> 36:57.915
I got lucky, huh?

36:57.917 --> 36:59.350
Right, babe?

36:59.352 --> 37:01.085
I wouldn't call it lucky.

37:01.087 --> 37:02.453
No?
No.

37:02.455 --> 37:03.654
I-I mean,

37:03.656 --> 37:05.156
I was, I was afraid

37:05.158 --> 37:07.491
you would think
I was damaged goods.

37:07.493 --> 37:09.427
That you wouldn't want me
with all that baggage.

37:09.429 --> 37:10.995
Baggage?

37:10.997 --> 37:12.797
Look, I got, um,

37:12.799 --> 37:16.701
I got plenty of baggage
my-my-myself, you know?

37:18.137 --> 37:20.504
I think between the two of us,
we may be able, be able

37:20.506 --> 37:22.073
to open up a luggage
joint one day, you know?

37:23.643 --> 37:25.576
Yeah.

37:25.578 --> 37:28.112
Look, um...

37:28.114 --> 37:30.214
I say that-that...

37:30.216 --> 37:32.250
that part of your life
is over with now.

37:32.252 --> 37:33.818
You know, it's finished.

37:33.820 --> 37:36.187
I mean, we... we can
start over right now.

37:36.189 --> 37:37.388
What do you say?

37:37.390 --> 37:39.123
Hmm?

37:39.125 --> 37:40.925
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah?

37:40.927 --> 37:43.227
Be good?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.864
I'm... Melissa Armstrong.

37:46.866 --> 37:49.200
Melissa Armstrong?

37:50.270 --> 37:51.802
Oh...

37:51.804 --> 37:53.170
Melissa Armstrong, I'm, uh,

37:53.172 --> 37:55.072
Danny Williams;
nice to meet you.

37:55.074 --> 37:57.241
It's nice to meet you.

38:05.785 --> 38:08.653
I'm so happy that
your partner's gonna be okay.

38:08.655 --> 38:10.354
Thank you.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.523
No, thank <i>you.</i>

38:15.327 --> 38:17.261
So what do you plan
to do with yourself

38:17.263 --> 38:19.697
now that Duclair's
crossed off the list?

38:19.699 --> 38:23.534
Walk away, retire,
start over.

38:23.536 --> 38:25.536
Try to let go of
all that guilt.

38:25.538 --> 38:28.039
You know, I spent
the last two years

38:28.041 --> 38:30.007
of my life just existing.

38:30.009 --> 38:32.476
I think it's time to
start living again.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.845
You know...

38:36.882 --> 38:38.416
...don't look back,

38:38.418 --> 38:40.584
okay?

38:41.386 --> 38:44.388
Just don't look back,
whatever you do.

38:44.390 --> 38:45.589
You can't change the past.

38:45.591 --> 38:48.092
Trust me on that.

38:48.094 --> 38:49.226
All right?

38:50.763 --> 38:52.096
You saved my life.

38:52.098 --> 38:53.397
You get a hug, okay?

38:56.668 --> 38:58.869
Thank you.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.240
Take care of yourself.

39:03.242 --> 39:04.475
I will.

39:04.477 --> 39:05.943
You do the same, okay?

39:05.945 --> 39:08.045
I will.

39:08.047 --> 39:10.047
Bye.

39:10.049 --> 39:12.216
Bye.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.672
Hey, boss, can I bum a smoke?

39:34.674 --> 39:37.141
Move.
Just kidding.

39:37.143 --> 39:39.343
Three.

40:04.236 --> 40:06.504
♪

40:25.824 --> 40:28.059
All right, all right...

40:28.994 --> 40:31.362
Grab that putter for me,
little girl.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.334
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

40:37.336 --> 40:38.836
So, Dad,

40:38.838 --> 40:40.237
how was my driving?

40:40.239 --> 40:42.640
Little mama, your driving
has been outstanding.

40:42.642 --> 40:46.077
Although not quite as
good as my driving.

40:46.079 --> 40:47.878
Off the tee, that is.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.146
Hey, don't hurt your shoulder

40:49.148 --> 40:51.015
patting yourself
on the back, okay?

40:51.017 --> 40:52.049
Is he always like that?

40:52.051 --> 40:53.784
Only when my mom
is not around.

40:53.786 --> 40:55.553
Let's leave your
mother out of this.

40:55.555 --> 40:57.154
Okay, well, Daddy,
I don't understand.

40:57.156 --> 41:00.791
How can you have 20 less strokes
than Uncle Steve

41:00.793 --> 41:02.126
and still be tied?

41:02.128 --> 41:05.329
Because despite
Uncle Steve having

41:05.331 --> 41:09.633
an LPGA Major-winning
golf professional

41:09.635 --> 41:10.734
as a caddy,

41:10.736 --> 41:13.437
he still has
a very large handicap...

41:13.439 --> 41:15.873
in more ways than one.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.176
It's easy putting.

41:19.178 --> 41:20.878
Hey, buddy!

41:20.880 --> 41:22.780
Yo, if you ever
play golf again,

41:22.782 --> 41:24.081
which you shouldn't,

41:24.083 --> 41:26.517
the idea is to get the ball
close to this little,

41:26.519 --> 41:28.085
uh, pin thing.

41:28.087 --> 41:29.153
That's my partner.

41:29.155 --> 41:30.254
Yeah, that's very
funny; well done.

41:30.256 --> 41:31.256
What are you doing here?

41:31.257 --> 41:33.524
You're supposed to be
at home resting.

41:33.526 --> 41:35.126
Yeah, the-the doctor thought
it would be a good idea

41:35.128 --> 41:37.194
for me to come out, get some
fresh air, and watch you

41:37.196 --> 41:39.597
humiliate yourself
on the golfing course here.

41:39.599 --> 41:41.198
If these are your friends,
I would hate

41:41.200 --> 41:43.534
to meet your enemies.
Yeah, tell me about it.

41:43.536 --> 41:45.402
Okay, I know it doesn't
look like it,

41:45.404 --> 41:46.770
but it's a very,
very makeable putt.

41:46.772 --> 41:47.905
You got this.
I got this?

41:47.907 --> 41:49.106
You got this.

41:52.278 --> 41:54.478
Excuse me.

41:56.515 --> 41:57.882
What?

41:57.884 --> 42:00.251
Listen, I didn't want
to shout this out

42:00.253 --> 42:01.218
and embarrass you

42:01.220 --> 42:02.953
in front of all
these folks, but, uh,

42:02.955 --> 42:04.155
would you mind

42:04.157 --> 42:06.323
if I just make this little
short putt to win it

42:06.325 --> 42:07.558
before you miss yours?

42:07.560 --> 42:09.560
Knock yourself out.

42:14.966 --> 42:17.134
All right.

42:21.373 --> 42:23.641
Here we go.

42:32.919 --> 42:34.919
Excuse me again.

42:34.921 --> 42:36.220
I thought you said
it broke away

42:36.222 --> 42:37.588
from the water?

42:41.993 --> 42:43.861
What do you want?
Oh, hey, buddy.

42:43.863 --> 42:48.065
Listen, uh, from way back here
it was hard for us to tell,

42:48.067 --> 42:49.300
but did that go in?

42:50.835 --> 42:52.536
All right.

42:54.406 --> 42:56.640
This is it.

42:56.642 --> 42:57.741
Last hole, last putt.

42:57.743 --> 42:59.743
You make this, you win.

42:59.745 --> 43:01.512
No pressure, right?

43:01.514 --> 43:03.013
No, no pressure.
You got this.

43:03.015 --> 43:04.815
Any time you're ready, Tiger.

43:05.617 --> 43:06.951
I got this.

43:07.786 --> 43:11.255
Okay, just visualize the ball

43:11.257 --> 43:12.523
falling into the cup.

43:12.525 --> 43:14.325
Yes, just
visualize the trophy

43:14.327 --> 43:15.793
falling into my hands.

43:15.795 --> 43:17.127
Don't listen to him,
just-just focus.

43:17.129 --> 43:18.495
You got this.
Just focus.

43:18.497 --> 43:20.764
Falling into the cup.

43:38.883 --> 43:40.317
Uh-huh.

43:40.319 --> 43:42.386
No...
Uh-huh!

43:42.388 --> 43:44.622
Oh, hell, no!
Oh!
