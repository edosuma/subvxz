how painful that might be.

Yeah, like you care.

44:25.975 --> 44:28.873
[SCOFFS]
Yeah, that'd be right.

44:28.875 --> 44:30.507
Don't need any carry on, Stan.

44:30.509 --> 44:31.507
STAN: <i>He</i> decked <i>me.</i>

44:31.509 --> 44:33.407
Every reason to,
by the sound of it.

44:33.409 --> 44:35.307
And what's a man
meant to do, huh?

44:35.309 --> 44:36.840
Stirring up his wife like that?

44:36.842 --> 44:38.440
FRASER:
She's gone, Stan.

44:38.442 --> 44:39.307
What?

44:39.309 --> 44:41.140
I took her to the station.

44:41.142 --> 44:43.040
Her and the kids.

44:43.042 --> 44:44.607
They're well on their way.

44:44.609 --> 44:46.042
What are you talking about?

44:46.609 --> 44:48.509
No, no, no, she can't.

44:51.476 --> 44:54.607
This is all you, hmm?
You and No-Nuts.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.840
Hey, watch your tongue.

44:56.842 --> 44:58.973
Your hens have come home
to roost, mate.

44:58.975 --> 45:02.207
And they're all yours.
The whole ruddy chook house.

45:02.209 --> 45:03.574
I'm gonna get you for it.

45:03.576 --> 45:06.641
You'll be gettin' no one,
or you'll be getting locked up.

45:06.643 --> 45:08.340
Come on.
I'll see you home.

45:08.342 --> 45:11.240
And you doped me up
so he can sneak my family off.

45:11.242 --> 45:12.940
Oh, you wait till people
hear about this, huh?

45:12.942 --> 45:14.340
There's gonna be plenty
on my side.

You wait!

45:17.376 --> 45:18.973
First sign of trouble, ring.

45:18.975 --> 45:20.474

Second-rate quacks.

45:20.476 --> 45:22.042
No wonder she died.

[DOOR SLAMS]

45:28.009 --> 45:30.840
First hint of that last bit
doing the rounds,

45:30.842 --> 45:32.908
stomp on it, hmm?

45:34.942 --> 45:36.808
Don't think I didn't
have my own doubts.

45:40.509 --> 45:42.042
Only defend me if you can.

45:44.142 --> 45:45.940
I hope you can.

45:45.942 --> 45:48.942
We will, Mr. Fox.

Thank you.

46:35.009 --> 46:39.743
DELIA: Ahh.
Dry as the Sahara in summer.

46:41.643 --> 46:43.407
Willy Maugham's boyfriend
taught me.

46:43.409 --> 46:46.407
DELIA: Alan? Oh, darling,
the only thing she does better

46:46.409 --> 46:49.442
than making martinis
is knocking them back.

46:51.075 --> 46:53.007
It's a good business model.

46:53.009 --> 46:54.906
Let's see what Caro makes of it.

46:54.908 --> 46:57.140
It's a bit of a lifeline.

46:57.142 --> 46:59.073
Her husband's
a stick in the mud.

46:59.075 --> 47:02.040
A darling one, I'm sure,
if she's with him.

47:02.042 --> 47:05.242
He's a good man, just stolid.

47:05.975 --> 47:08.540
I doubt he'd understand
her Sapphic phase.

47:08.542 --> 47:10.607
And that's all it was.

47:10.609 --> 47:12.707
She dipped her toe in the water

47:12.709 --> 47:15.407
while I embraced
the full plunge.

47:15.409 --> 47:17.376
[LAUGHS]

47:17.942 --> 47:20.643
Enough double entendre.
I shall behave.

47:21.808 --> 47:22.641
Good.

47:22.643 --> 47:24.307
But should she wish not to...

47:24.309 --> 47:26.107
[CHUCKLES]

47:26.109 --> 47:28.743
The suspense is delicious.

47:35.242 --> 47:37.476
I've set the alarm for 6:00.

47:39.842 --> 47:42.009
What a beautiful night.

47:47.042 --> 47:49.173
I might quit.

47:49.175 --> 47:51.209
These might not be good
for the baby.

OLIVIA:
I don't see how they could harm.

47:53.643 --> 47:55.274
ANNA:
Mm, one never knows.

47:55.276 --> 47:56.676
Or this.

47:57.808 --> 47:59.576
I'd ask Henry if he were here.

48:03.676 --> 48:06.576
Going back may well bring it
to a head.

48:07.309 --> 48:10.873
His relative proximity
will increase my guilt.

48:10.875 --> 48:11.840
OLIVIA: Guilt?

48:11.842 --> 48:13.374
Yes.

48:13.376 --> 48:14.842
There is guilt.

48:17.142 --> 48:18.509
What to do?

48:21.042 --> 48:22.743

Still a bed on the veranda.

49:07.442 --> 49:09.240

Sleep inside.

Ah, you know me and fresh air.

Ohh.
