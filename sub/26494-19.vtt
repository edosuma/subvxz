WEBVTT

00:02.292 --> 00:04.258
Stacy!

00:04.260 --> 00:06.828
We knew Jack was dangerous.
We always knew.

00:06.830 --> 00:08.496
Jack, stop.

00:11.167 --> 00:13.635
- So, what do we do?
- We fight.

00:15.338 --> 00:16.938
I killed Mary.

00:18.575 --> 00:20.174
- You're dead to me.
- I failed you.

00:20.176 --> 00:21.275
And I failed Jack.

00:21.277 --> 00:23.444
Go to Heaven
and find her!

00:25.382 --> 00:27.915
- Where's Naomi?
- Castiel, run!

00:27.917 --> 00:29.250
It's none
of your business.

00:29.252 --> 00:31.052
- I'm looking for someone.
- Mary Winchester?

00:31.054 --> 00:33.087
There may be a way
to bring her back.

00:33.089 --> 00:35.623
- "Necromantiorum."
- I don't want your help.

00:35.625 --> 00:37.892
I'm your, you know,
subconscious or whatever.

00:37.894 --> 00:39.761
Y-You whipped me up to
help you figure this out.

00:39.763 --> 00:41.729
You know it's not gonna work.
Admit it.

00:41.731 --> 00:43.631
You don't feel anything
anymore.

00:43.633 --> 00:46.401
Jack is using magic
to bring your mom back.

00:48.905 --> 00:50.238
It didn't work.

01:28.111 --> 01:30.144
We know it wasn't easy
for some of you to get here,

01:30.146 --> 01:32.313
and we thank you.

01:32.315 --> 01:34.282
We, uh...

01:34.284 --> 01:36.818
We gave her a Hunter's send-off
a few days ago.

01:38.154 --> 01:41.656
But we know that her family
went beyond just us.

01:41.658 --> 01:45.159
Some of you Hunted
alongside her.

01:45.161 --> 01:48.196
Some of you fought Michael
with her in the other world.

01:48.198 --> 01:50.631
You know,
we lost our mom once before.

01:52.302 --> 01:55.470
But we got a second chance
with her.

01:55.472 --> 01:59.607
And we got to know her
not just as "Mom," but...

01:59.609 --> 02:05.313
as someone who was tough
and strong.

02:05.315 --> 02:06.848
Stubborn as Hell.

02:08.884 --> 02:12.820
Someone who had opinions
and wasn't shy to use them.

02:15.625 --> 02:18.559
She could handle a machete.

02:18.561 --> 02:22.130
She could handle a vampire.

02:22.132 --> 02:24.198
She could handle our old man.

02:27.337 --> 02:29.170
She couldn't cook worth a damn.

02:32.909 --> 02:36.744
Mom, you weren't here
long enough.

02:36.746 --> 02:38.813
But we're, uh...

02:42.685 --> 02:44.685
we're so glad
for the time that we had.

02:48.725 --> 02:49.824
Goodbye, Mom.

02:49.826 --> 02:51.559
Bye, Mom.

02:51.561 --> 02:54.095
To Mary.

Damn wraith.

03:30.526 --> 03:33.194
Knew him from a nest
your mom and I busted up

03:33.196 --> 03:35.029
on our last Hunt.

03:35.031 --> 03:37.798
Probably here to gloat.
The bastard.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.000
Thanks for
coming out.

03:40.002 --> 03:43.804
A Hunter's memorial,
complete with monster.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.373
Mary would have
appreciated that.

03:46.375 --> 03:50.544
Now that
you mention it, yeah.

03:50.546 --> 03:52.046
How are <i>you?</i>

03:53.216 --> 03:56.217
Hey, you know. It's tough.

03:56.219 --> 03:58.786
And the other one?

04:02.091 --> 04:06.026
Yeah, Dean...
seems to be doing okay.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.161
Hard to say.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.396
Yeah.

04:09.398 --> 04:11.232
Maybe he's like me.

04:11.234 --> 04:15.402
Bein' teary in public's
not my style.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.612
Hey. Uh, most
everybody's headed out,

04:24.614 --> 04:27.047
but Bobby's
gonna stick around.

04:27.049 --> 04:31.085
I thought maybe we could open
that Scotch Ketch left and...

04:31.087 --> 04:32.553
hang out,
talk about Mom.

04:32.555 --> 04:34.255
"Talk about Mom"?

04:34.257 --> 04:35.890
Yeah.

04:35.892 --> 04:38.225
Isn't that
what we've <i>been</i> doing?

04:58.781 --> 05:00.548
Thanks.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.783
Memory lane?

05:02.785 --> 05:04.385
Yeah.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.720
I mean, Dean couldn't have
been but 4 years old.

05:06.722 --> 05:08.422
I wasn't even 6 months.
Just --

05:08.424 --> 05:10.057
Hmm.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.992
You know, at one time,
you boys were good-lookin'.

05:11.994 --> 05:14.428
Thanks.

05:14.430 --> 05:15.930
Sam.

05:15.932 --> 05:19.066
What exactly
happened to her?

05:19.068 --> 05:21.502
Because I'm hearin'
the kid...

05:23.940 --> 05:26.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.842
You need anything?

05:28.844 --> 05:30.678
Yeah, I need a drink.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.079
Bar's open.

05:32.081 --> 05:35.683
Nah, I need to get
outta here for a while.

05:35.685 --> 05:38.485
But, dude, we got to
talk about Jack.

05:38.487 --> 05:40.654
We will.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.924
About that.

05:43.926 --> 05:48.329
I liked the kid.
We fought together.

05:48.331 --> 05:50.864
But there's only
one way this ends.

05:50.866 --> 05:54.668
Bobby's right. We have to
find Jack and help him.

05:54.670 --> 05:59.106
What? That kid --
he killed Mary!

05:59.108 --> 06:01.041
I know that.

06:01.043 --> 06:03.110
Ah-ah.
Don't say "but."

06:03.112 --> 06:05.679
But...he --

06:05.681 --> 06:08.282
Jack may not even realize
what he did was wrong.

06:08.284 --> 06:12.886
If his human side is gone,
you know what's left -- Lucifer.

06:12.888 --> 06:15.356
Now, if you boys want to
sit around and talk, fine.

06:15.358 --> 06:17.291
But me?
I'm gonna get on the horn

06:17.293 --> 06:20.127
to some of my people
and go find that boy.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.729
And what then?

06:25.201 --> 06:29.169
An unstoppable monster
who don't know right from wrong

06:29.171 --> 06:30.738
gets put down --

06:30.740 --> 06:32.906
or the closest
we can get to it.

06:32.908 --> 06:36.810
And anybody who don't know that
needs to go back to school.

06:52.762 --> 06:55.896
<i>- Take me home, Jack.</i>
<i>- Tell me it's okay.</i>

06:55.898 --> 06:57.998
If Sam and Dean
saw what you did...

06:58.000 --> 07:00.734
<i>they would be</i>
<i>as worried as I am.</i>

07:00.736 --> 07:03.037
<i>Are you gonna</i>
<i>tell them?</i>

07:03.039 --> 07:05.039
- Leave me alone!
- Please!

07:05.041 --> 07:07.841
- Listen! Jack?
- Leave me alone.

07:09.278 --> 07:11.045
- Listen to me!
- Leave me alone!

07:13.549 --> 07:17.618
I wish you were here.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.187
Mom...

07:20.189 --> 07:23.524
I need you to tell me
what to do.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.225
Well...

07:26.562 --> 07:27.961
Next best thing.

07:27.963 --> 07:31.932
You're just in my head.
I'm making you up.

07:31.934 --> 07:36.070
Or you see me because you know
I tell you the truth.

07:37.873 --> 07:40.140
- No.
- Hmm.

07:40.142 --> 07:44.144
And, by the way, buddy.
Um, I'm real.

07:44.146 --> 07:46.213
You're part of my DNA.

07:46.215 --> 07:49.149
I'm locked in your head
and your heart forever.

07:53.089 --> 07:54.988
- I'm not listening to you.
- So what are you gonna do?

07:54.990 --> 07:58.125
You just gonna pine away for
Mommy and the Winchesters?

07:58.127 --> 08:01.795
Only they --
they never loved you.

08:01.797 --> 08:03.497
You're nothing to them.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.733
You're just their -- You're
just a little pet monster.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.134
Their -- Their muscle.

08:07.136 --> 08:09.603
No, they --
They'll understand

08:09.605 --> 08:13.240
about...what happened.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.008
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'll explain it to them.

08:15.010 --> 08:16.276
It -- It was an accident.

08:16.278 --> 08:20.314
And I tried to
bring her back, and...

08:20.316 --> 08:22.216
They've made mistakes, too.

08:23.686 --> 08:26.553
Okay. Dude...

08:27.690 --> 08:29.323
They hate you.

08:29.325 --> 08:32.793
Okay? They don't even want you
for a pet anymore.

08:32.794 --> 08:35.962
From here on out,
you're all you got.

08:37.533 --> 08:41.034
Well, and me.

08:41.035 --> 08:43.169
Especially me.

09:30.557 --> 09:33.057
Castiel.
What a pleasant surprise.

09:33.059 --> 09:34.726
It's urgent
that I see Naomi.

09:34.728 --> 09:37.428
And, like I told you before,
she is unavailable.

09:37.430 --> 09:39.430
What does that mean?
Just tell me.

09:39.432 --> 09:44.269
It means the Empty invaded.
Under her watch.

09:44.271 --> 09:47.572
We almost died.
Under her watch.

09:47.574 --> 09:49.407
Heaven needs a leader.

09:49.409 --> 09:50.975
A leader like you?

09:50.977 --> 09:54.412
Oh, I'm not my first choice,
either, but here we are.

09:56.416 --> 09:58.549
A-And Naomi, she's...?

09:58.551 --> 10:00.818
In a very small cell.

10:00.820 --> 10:03.888
Not that you should care.
She wasn't your biggest fan.

10:03.890 --> 10:05.390
No, but I needed
her help.

10:05.392 --> 10:06.424
With?

10:06.426 --> 10:08.126
To find an archangel.

10:08.128 --> 10:09.594
Really?

10:09.596 --> 10:12.130
I mean, 'cause,
after Michael, there's --

10:12.132 --> 10:13.498
there's none of those left.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.434
This isn't exactly a --

10:16.436 --> 10:17.936
It's the Nephilim.

10:17.938 --> 10:19.837
Lucifer's love child.

10:19.839 --> 10:23.007
Jack has grown
massively powerful.

10:23.009 --> 10:24.442
Dangerously so.

10:24.444 --> 10:26.277
And I thought that
it was his "mother's side"

10:26.279 --> 10:28.246
that was supposed to
give him self-control.

10:28.248 --> 10:32.684
Well, in the sense that he
inherited her decency, yes.

10:32.686 --> 10:35.420
But that was before.

10:35.422 --> 10:36.888
Before what?

10:38.258 --> 10:41.359
Before he burned through
his soul.

10:41.361 --> 10:44.395
To save me.
Among others.

10:46.266 --> 10:51.169
So he lost his capacity for good
through an act of goodness.

10:54.374 --> 10:56.274
What about
the Winchesters?

10:56.276 --> 10:58.476
Jack's no longer
with them.

10:58.478 --> 11:03.781
He's on the run.
He's fearful of their fury.

11:03.783 --> 11:05.316
I bet he is.

11:05.318 --> 11:09.053
But I am hopeful
that he can be salvaged.

11:09.055 --> 11:14.959
He can be rehabilitated, with
patient molding and guidance.

11:14.961 --> 11:17.161
I'll see what I can do.

11:27.374 --> 11:29.807
Hey.
You just getting back?

11:29.809 --> 11:31.709
Yeah.

11:31.711 --> 11:34.145
- How you feeling?
- What you working on?

11:34.147 --> 11:37.081
I, uh --
I'm trying to find Jack.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.916
We got to find him
before Bobby and his crew,

11:38.918 --> 11:40.351
'cause if they
find him first --

11:40.353 --> 11:41.753
He's gonna kill 'em all?

11:41.755 --> 11:43.388
I don't know.

11:45.692 --> 11:48.760
You know, I can't stop
thinking about Mom.

11:50.263 --> 11:52.597
Yeah.

11:52.599 --> 11:55.466
I-I can't stop
thinking that...

11:59.539 --> 12:01.539
Most people,
it's -- it's --

12:01.541 --> 12:05.576
it's -- it's hope
and faith, right?

12:05.578 --> 12:10.748
That's all they have.
But we know the truth.

12:10.750 --> 12:13.518
We know God is real.
We know angels are real, too.

12:13.520 --> 12:17.288
God writes paperback books
in his underwear, okay?

12:17.290 --> 12:19.090
And angels are dicks.

12:19.092 --> 12:21.559
But they're real, right?

12:21.561 --> 12:25.430
We know that Mom's not sitting
on a cloud playing a harp.

12:25.432 --> 12:26.964
She's in a good place.

12:26.966 --> 12:29.834
Or she's in a <i>great</i> place.
She's with Dad.

12:31.538 --> 12:33.137
Hmm.

12:33.139 --> 12:36.374
You know what else?

12:36.376 --> 12:39.544
There wasn't enough left of her
to even try to bring her back.

12:51.291 --> 12:54.559
Hello, Jack.

12:54.561 --> 12:57.061
Remember me?

12:57.063 --> 13:00.331
We met -- in Heaven.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.266
Yes, we did.

13:02.268 --> 13:03.768
How did you find me?

13:03.770 --> 13:06.571
Jack, I came here
to tell you something.

13:06.573 --> 13:09.707
Something important.

13:10.844 --> 13:12.176
It wasn't your fault.

13:13.847 --> 13:15.947
What happened
with Mary Winchester.

13:15.949 --> 13:18.316
You know about that?

13:18.318 --> 13:21.519
Jack, it was a mistake.

13:21.521 --> 13:24.422
That doesn't mean that you
don't deserve redemption.

13:24.424 --> 13:26.324
I know...

13:26.326 --> 13:28.659
Heaven knows...

13:28.661 --> 13:33.831
your mother knew that you have
a <i>glorious</i> destiny.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.266
I do?

13:38.271 --> 13:41.139
Look at the world
around you, Jack.

13:41.141 --> 13:44.675
You know, there was a time
when Earth had moral order.

13:44.677 --> 13:47.378
When God would punish those
who did wrong

13:47.380 --> 13:49.847
and who didn't respect
Heaven.

13:51.985 --> 13:56.020
But when he left,
it all fell apart.

13:56.022 --> 13:57.622
You could change that.

13:57.624 --> 14:00.491
You couldn't save
Mary Winchester, but...

14:00.493 --> 14:03.327
but you can save
so many others,

14:03.329 --> 14:06.631
even Heaven itself.

14:06.633 --> 14:09.534
You could make the world
so much better.

14:11.504 --> 14:16.240
And think how happy
that would make Sam and Dean.

14:36.696 --> 14:38.162
Dr. Tate.

14:38.164 --> 14:39.804
You've come about the leak
in my bathroom?

14:41.868 --> 14:43.768
Hardly.

14:44.871 --> 14:46.938
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

14:46.940 --> 14:52.176
"Fake News:
Biblical Lies."

14:52.178 --> 14:54.579
Quite the best seller,
I believe.

14:54.581 --> 14:57.682
People are hungry
for the truth.

14:57.684 --> 15:00.351
And your call to
reject God and Heaven --

15:00.353 --> 15:01.786
that is the "truth"?

15:01.788 --> 15:04.021
It's an attempt to replace
wishful thinking

15:04.023 --> 15:05.556
with rational thought.

15:07.427 --> 15:10.461
In more civilized times,
that was called heresy.

15:10.463 --> 15:13.631
And those ideas
were an affront to Heaven.

15:13.633 --> 15:15.733
If there <i>were</i> a Heaven.

15:15.735 --> 15:18.102
Oh, there is.
I've been there.

15:18.104 --> 15:22.106
I see.
And I suppose you saw God?

15:22.108 --> 15:25.443
No.

15:25.445 --> 15:27.144
But he is my grandfather.

15:27.146 --> 15:31.282
Huh. So then that would
make your father...

15:31.284 --> 15:32.450
Lucifer.

15:34.287 --> 15:36.787
Professor Tate,
Heaven is not unreasonable.

15:36.789 --> 15:39.557
You can avoid divine
retribution by announcing

15:39.559 --> 15:45.329
to your considerable audience
that you've had a revelation...

15:45.331 --> 15:48.933
that everything you've
written to date is false...

15:48.935 --> 15:50.635
that God is good.

15:50.637 --> 15:54.272
Yeah. You're insane. And I would
rather call security.

16:15.109 --> 16:17.524
So, the angels --
they're gonna help us?

16:17.525 --> 16:19.358
I was promised
every effort

16:19.360 --> 16:21.727
would be made
to, uh, locate Jack.

16:21.729 --> 16:23.562
Oh. Heaven promised?
Great.

16:23.564 --> 16:25.865
Well, we should take that
to the bank.

16:25.867 --> 16:29.101
Jack's powers
could also be a threat.

16:29.103 --> 16:31.337
It serves them
to help find him.

16:31.339 --> 16:32.705
Yeah, about that.

16:32.707 --> 16:34.874
Um, I've been looking
for anything weird.

16:34.876 --> 16:38.077
And a university professor
was found dead

16:38.079 --> 16:40.446
in his office in Ohio.

16:41.849 --> 16:46.352
His body was crystallized
into a block of salt.

16:46.354 --> 16:50.122
Salt. Why's that
sound familiar?

16:50.124 --> 16:54.627
It's a pillar of salt.
It's Biblical.

16:54.629 --> 16:57.630
Lot's wife.
Punished by Heaven.

16:57.632 --> 16:59.598
This guy
was an atheist.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.400
He wrote a bunch
of best-selling books

17:01.402 --> 17:04.303
trying to disprove
God and Heaven.

17:04.305 --> 17:05.871
Okay. So you think
an angel iced him?

17:05.873 --> 17:08.273
No ordinary angel could do
something like that.

17:08.276 --> 17:10.242
Just wait.
There's another.

17:10.243 --> 17:12.044
A few hours after
the professor was killed,

17:12.046 --> 17:16.214
a lady in Texas fell into
a crevice that opened up,

17:16.217 --> 17:17.750
and she was killed.

17:17.752 --> 17:19.718
- Like a sinkhole.
- That's what I thought, too.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.252
But a witness said
it was more like

17:21.255 --> 17:23.289
"a fissure opened
under her feet

17:23.290 --> 17:25.657
then closed back up
with her inside."

17:25.660 --> 17:29.295
"And the Earth opened her mouth
and swallowed them up,

17:29.297 --> 17:31.163
and their houses,

17:31.165 --> 17:33.732
and all of the men that
appertained unto Korah."

17:33.734 --> 17:35.901
It's Numbers 26:10.

17:35.903 --> 17:38.671
This lady was a --
a TV evangelist.

17:38.673 --> 17:40.472
Um, she was
under investigation

17:40.474 --> 17:43.409
for stealing thousands of
dollars through fake charities.

17:43.411 --> 17:45.911
So either Chuck
came back, which --

17:45.913 --> 17:48.781
That ain't
gonna happen, or...

17:48.783 --> 17:50.149
Jack.

17:50.151 --> 17:55.688
You've done
excellent work, Jack.

17:55.690 --> 17:59.792
When God was in his prime,
Heaven was in its glory.

17:59.794 --> 18:02.461
Working as a team,
we can bring that back.

18:02.463 --> 18:04.263
Sam and Dean
will like that?

18:04.265 --> 18:07.533
Words can't begin to express
how Sam and Dean will feel.

18:07.535 --> 18:09.134
Now...

18:09.136 --> 18:12.137
here is the real test.

18:12.139 --> 18:14.807
We need more angels.

18:14.809 --> 18:19.178
You're not God. You can't just
make them out of thin air.

18:19.180 --> 18:23.482
But if a human
were predisposed to it,

18:23.484 --> 18:25.618
maybe you could
take their soul

18:25.620 --> 18:27.820
and forge them
into one of us.

18:29.490 --> 18:31.323
What do you say?

18:38.833 --> 18:43.469
This is where your grandfather
received prayers.

18:45.706 --> 18:50.075
Make yourself still.
And available.

18:50.077 --> 18:52.511
Focus.

18:52.513 --> 18:54.546
You'll hear.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.764
<i>Dear God, please help...</i>

19:26.766 --> 19:28.536
<i>Please, God, let the Giants</i>
<i>win the World Series.</i>

19:28.537 --> 19:30.236
Please, God....

19:30.238 --> 19:34.340
we beseech you
to hear our prayer.

19:34.342 --> 19:37.977
We humbly ask that you receive

19:37.979 --> 19:40.246
our gratitude for your gifts...

19:40.248 --> 19:43.516
and pray that you deliver us
unto Heaven

19:43.518 --> 19:45.218
and the greater glory.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.519
Amen!

19:46.521 --> 19:48.221
Amen!

19:48.223 --> 19:53.026
Okay. I sure hope everyone
did the reading last week.

19:53.028 --> 19:54.928
- Uh-huh.
- Yes.

19:54.930 --> 19:58.097
Small surprise --
Pastor Ames is coming by

19:58.099 --> 20:00.867
to discuss the Book of Samuel.

20:03.438 --> 20:07.407
Oh! Sorry.
I-I didn't see you come in.

20:07.409 --> 20:09.609
Please. Join us.

20:10.879 --> 20:12.445
Take a seat,
mister...?

20:12.447 --> 20:15.748
Jack.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.417
My name is Jack.

20:22.624 --> 20:26.292
Did you mean it when you said
you wanted to go to Heaven?

20:26.294 --> 20:27.594
- Yes.
- Yes.

20:27.596 --> 20:30.363
That's the goal of everyone
in this room.

20:30.365 --> 20:31.864
Mm-hmm.

20:31.866 --> 20:34.067
And you don't mind
becoming angels?

20:35.770 --> 20:37.637
Mind?

20:37.639 --> 20:38.972
Yeah!

20:38.974 --> 20:40.440
That would be a dream.

20:41.810 --> 20:44.077
It doesn't
have to be a dream.

20:45.547 --> 20:48.414
I-I'm not sure
I understand.

21:07.936 --> 21:09.435
Ohh!

21:12.307 --> 21:14.841
Who are you?

21:14.843 --> 21:17.577
Come with me.

21:17.579 --> 21:19.979
To Heaven.

21:21.483 --> 21:24.083
So, who's ready to take
on the Book of Samuel?

21:24.085 --> 21:26.019
Hello.

21:26.021 --> 21:29.589
I was just taking your
friends -- to become angels.

21:29.591 --> 21:31.591
You -- What?

21:31.593 --> 21:32.992
Would you like
to join them?

21:36.698 --> 21:42.001
Son. This isn't funny.
It's not even possible.

21:42.003 --> 21:46.039
So...you're saying
you don't believe?

21:46.041 --> 21:48.808
It's not that
I don't believe.

21:48.810 --> 21:50.643
I just don't believe <i>you.</i>

21:50.645 --> 21:52.512
And --

21:54.649 --> 21:56.215
Shelley?

21:56.217 --> 21:58.685
Sir, please don't interfere
with Heaven's work.

21:58.687 --> 22:00.353
All right. Get out!

22:02.924 --> 22:08.127
"He was eaten by worms
and breathed his last."

22:33.388 --> 22:35.088
Sir...

22:42.564 --> 22:44.897
Pastor Ames? Hi.

22:44.899 --> 22:48.234
Agent Kilmister.
Clarke and Taylor. FBI.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.403
We want to ask you
about last night.

22:50.405 --> 22:51.938
What happened
to your congregation?

22:51.940 --> 22:55.108
You want to know w--

22:55.110 --> 22:57.877
They're all -- They're gone.
They're all gone.

22:57.879 --> 23:01.247
We're trying to figure out
exactly what happened.

23:01.249 --> 23:04.550
You're just
gonna think I'm crazy.

23:04.552 --> 23:06.252
The cops did.

23:06.254 --> 23:11.057
About that, uh, the police
report stated that you said

23:11.059 --> 23:13.126
the group "disappeared"
right in front of you.

23:13.128 --> 23:14.393
Yeah.

23:14.395 --> 23:15.928
Did he say where
he was taking them?

23:15.930 --> 23:20.466
To Heaven.
To become angels.

23:21.970 --> 23:25.171
Did he look
anything like this?

23:27.542 --> 23:28.708
That's him.

23:28.710 --> 23:31.878
I tried to
stop him, but --

23:31.880 --> 23:33.412
And he did
all this to you?

23:33.414 --> 23:37.950
He just waved his hand,
and I landed on the floor,

23:37.952 --> 23:41.754
and these cuts opened up
all over my body.

23:43.658 --> 23:46.058
And worms crawled out of 'em.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.260
Worms!

23:47.262 --> 23:49.162
Worms.

23:49.164 --> 23:52.832
He said he was carrying out
Heaven's orders...

23:52.834 --> 23:55.201
and that I wasn't
a believer.

23:58.573 --> 24:01.374
- Well, feel better.
- Yeah.

24:09.818 --> 24:13.119
"Immediately an angel of
the Lord struck him down,

24:13.121 --> 24:15.755
because he did not give God
the glory,

24:15.757 --> 24:19.425
and he was eaten by worms
and breathed his last."

24:19.427 --> 24:21.160
Wait. So this is
another Bible thing?

24:22.297 --> 24:23.896
What the Hell
is going on?

24:35.443 --> 24:37.276
I didn't want it
to come to this, either.

24:37.278 --> 24:39.011
But I know that that kid's
head's not right.

24:39.013 --> 24:40.646
And now that Heaven
has its hooks in him,

24:40.648 --> 24:42.215
we don't have a choice.

24:42.217 --> 24:44.217
Wait. Come to what?
What are you talking about?

24:44.219 --> 24:46.219
Stopping Jack.
Once and for all.

24:46.221 --> 24:50.790
All right. Fine. Say I agree.
Dean, he can't be killed.

24:50.792 --> 24:52.658
No, but he can be
contained.

24:55.496 --> 24:57.897
How are we
supposed to do that?

25:06.975 --> 25:09.575
With this.

25:09.577 --> 25:15.014
Are we seriously talking
about locking Jack in this?

25:15.016 --> 25:17.416
No, we're seriously talking
about not having a choice.

25:17.418 --> 25:18.918
We can't kill him, okay?

25:18.920 --> 25:22.555
And this is warded
to lock down an archangel.

25:22.557 --> 25:24.657
Yeah. So -- So, what?

25:24.659 --> 25:33.232
We -- We just...
force him inside?

25:33.234 --> 25:35.735
Maybe.

25:35.737 --> 25:38.537
But he might.

25:38.539 --> 25:40.940
He might if he only has to
stay in there long enough

25:40.942 --> 25:44.744
for us to finish the spell
to fix his soul.

25:44.746 --> 25:47.380
Spell?

25:47.382 --> 25:50.082
What spell?
There <i>is</i> no spell.

25:50.084 --> 25:53.586
<i>We</i> know that.

25:56.190 --> 25:59.358
So you want
to lie to him.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.595
No. Well, I mean, I <i>want</i>
Zeppelin to get back together.

26:02.597 --> 26:04.964
But what I need --
What <i>we</i> need is to stop Jack.

26:04.966 --> 26:06.532
Big difference.

26:06.534 --> 26:08.801
But here's the deal.
We both got to sign off on it.

26:08.803 --> 26:11.237
This might be our only shot,
and if he even catches a whiff

26:11.239 --> 26:13.272
that this is a scam,
he's off into the wind.

26:13.274 --> 26:14.874
Exactly.

26:14.876 --> 26:17.076
And how do you think he's not
gonna know something's up?

26:18.212 --> 26:20.880
Because you're gonna be
so damn sincere.

26:20.882 --> 26:22.315
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

26:22.317 --> 26:23.983
Why me?

26:23.985 --> 26:25.952
Because you've always been
in his corner, all right?

26:25.954 --> 26:27.753
You're his go-to guy.

26:27.755 --> 26:29.422
Sam, if you reach out,
he'll come.

26:29.424 --> 26:32.825
If I do it, after what happened
to Mom, I could lose it.

26:35.063 --> 26:36.595
I <i>will</i> lose it.

26:56.829 --> 27:01.065
Eremiel,
open the portal.

27:01.067 --> 27:03.534
No can do, my brother.

27:03.536 --> 27:05.302
Heaven is now closed.

27:05.304 --> 27:07.404
No, it's not.
I was just there.

27:07.406 --> 27:09.540
I'm sorry.
I said that wrong.

27:09.542 --> 27:13.177
Heaven is closed to <i>you.</i>

27:13.179 --> 27:14.545
Orders.

27:14.547 --> 27:17.581
Eremiel.

27:17.583 --> 27:19.850
I <i>am</i> going to Heaven.

27:19.852 --> 27:24.221
That's what everyone thinks.

27:41.107 --> 27:43.541
Ohh!

27:43.543 --> 27:44.909
It's working, Jack.

27:53.352 --> 27:55.219
Really, Eremiel?

27:55.221 --> 27:57.588
Huh!

27:58.658 --> 28:01.458
Castiel! Good news.

28:01.460 --> 28:03.360
I found Jack.

28:03.362 --> 28:06.564
Cass! Look!
I'm making angels.

28:06.566 --> 28:10.768
Yes, you, uh --

28:10.770 --> 28:12.903
Dumah. A word?

28:15.808 --> 28:17.474
Now!

28:18.978 --> 28:22.446
I-I don't think
this is gonna work.

28:22.448 --> 28:24.148
One way to find out.

28:33.659 --> 28:36.493
Jack.

28:36.495 --> 28:39.096
I hope you can hear this.

28:39.098 --> 28:40.497
<i>I hope you can hear this.</i>

28:40.499 --> 28:42.233
<i>Some things...</i>

28:42.235 --> 28:44.134
Some things,
some bad things happened.

28:44.136 --> 28:46.904
But we're family.
We're your family.

28:46.906 --> 28:49.907
A-And bad things
happen in families.

28:49.909 --> 28:51.508
<i>...bad things happen</i>
<i>in families.</i>

28:51.510 --> 28:52.977
But we, uh...
<i>We, uh...</i>

28:52.979 --> 28:54.745
We want to talk with you.

28:54.747 --> 28:58.249
That's how we can all...
get through this.

28:58.251 --> 29:01.785
<i>That's how we can all</i>
<i>move forward.</i>

29:01.787 --> 29:05.589
I know
what you're doing.

29:05.591 --> 29:09.693
You're using Jack to
solidify your hold on Heaven.

29:12.131 --> 29:14.665
Someone has loose lips.

29:18.604 --> 29:20.838
You're establishing
a reign of terror,

29:20.840 --> 29:24.642
beating humans into submission,
stripping Heaven of its mercy.

29:24.644 --> 29:27.177
Oh, Heaven never really
had any mercy, Castiel.

29:27.179 --> 29:28.679
You know that.

29:28.681 --> 29:31.448
I am <i>saving</i> Heaven.

29:31.450 --> 29:36.053
I am saving our kind.
I am saving the world.

29:37.890 --> 29:40.024
Jack, we want --

29:40.026 --> 29:43.227
We <i>need</i> to see you.

29:43.229 --> 29:46.563
Our mother would want it.

29:46.565 --> 29:48.866
<i>Your</i> mother would want it.

29:48.868 --> 29:51.035
<i>Your mother would want it.</i>

29:51.037 --> 29:55.973
I can't control Jack.
You've seen his strength.

29:55.975 --> 29:59.843
He's strong, yes,
but still a child

29:59.845 --> 30:01.812
and without a soul
to guide him.

30:01.814 --> 30:04.315
I can guide him.

30:04.317 --> 30:07.551
Jack, we just want things
to be the way they were.

30:07.553 --> 30:09.853
<i>We just want things</i>
<i>to be the way they were.</i>

30:09.855 --> 30:12.423
Are you hearing this?
<i>Are you hearing this?</i>

30:12.425 --> 30:13.857
I am.

30:13.859 --> 30:15.659
I'm getting Jack
out of here.

30:15.661 --> 30:18.429
No...you're not.

30:18.431 --> 30:21.598
You really want
this fight, Dumah?

30:21.600 --> 30:24.935
Fight? I'm holding
the high cards here.

30:24.937 --> 30:26.503
Ma and Pa Winchester,

30:26.505 --> 30:30.007
they're living in
their own personal Heaven.

30:30.009 --> 30:35.713
One snap of these fingers,
and all of that ends.

30:48.361 --> 30:50.627
Jack? Jack!

30:56.402 --> 31:00.070
Guess he didn't hear.

31:02.208 --> 31:05.809
I heard.
And I was so glad.

31:05.811 --> 31:09.346
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

31:11.150 --> 31:14.151
I've been working with the
angels to purify the world.

31:14.153 --> 31:18.055
Oh, and making angels.

31:18.057 --> 31:19.723
Yeah. I make angels.

31:21.394 --> 31:24.094
But...I really
missed you guys.

31:24.096 --> 31:28.632
Yeah. Us too.
Right, Sammy?

31:28.634 --> 31:30.634
Tell Jack how, uh --

31:30.636 --> 31:33.804
how we want to clear things up,
you know, between us.

31:33.806 --> 31:37.508
I know -- I know
things have been bad.

31:37.510 --> 31:41.045
A-And, if it helps,
I regret it.

31:42.581 --> 31:44.381
The accident.

31:46.619 --> 31:48.952
The -- The accident?

31:48.954 --> 31:50.554
What happened to Mary.

31:51.957 --> 31:55.959
She kept talking about my soul,
t-that I didn't have a soul,

31:55.961 --> 31:57.528
and she kept pushing.

31:57.530 --> 32:00.764
Oh, so...
she <i>made</i> you do it.

32:00.766 --> 32:05.002
No, it -- it was me,
but I didn't want

32:05.004 --> 32:09.940
this no-soul thing to
become an issue between us.

32:09.942 --> 32:12.009
I guess I snapped.

32:17.283 --> 32:20.617
Before I knew it,
it was all over.

32:20.619 --> 32:23.754
"It" being the "accident."

32:30.296 --> 32:33.730
I wish it didn't happen.

32:33.732 --> 32:35.699
Yeah, Jack. So do we.

32:37.570 --> 32:39.136
But...

32:39.138 --> 32:42.206
w-we understand.

32:42.208 --> 32:43.707
And we forgive you.

32:43.709 --> 32:47.845
You know, for the,
uh, "accident."

32:49.748 --> 32:52.382
That's what you want,
right, Jack?

32:52.384 --> 32:56.086
I mean, you -- you --
you'd like that?

32:57.890 --> 33:01.391
I'd like for things to
go back the way they were.

33:04.430 --> 33:05.963
I knew you'd understand.

33:07.933 --> 33:11.668
So if we told you
that we were close

33:11.670 --> 33:14.238
to being able
to fix your soul,

33:14.240 --> 33:18.742
we just need to keep you safe
until everything is ready,

33:18.744 --> 33:20.344
you -- you'd be okay
with that?

33:20.346 --> 33:23.747
"Safe"?
What do you mean?

33:23.749 --> 33:27.117
Well, you could hurt
other people.

33:27.119 --> 33:30.654
Have another, uh,
accident.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.291
Oh.

33:34.293 --> 33:38.862
We -- We want to
keep you safe, Jack.

33:38.864 --> 33:43.400
That also means we -- we have to
keep you safe from yourself.

33:44.737 --> 33:47.437
You know,
just so nobody else gets hurt,

33:47.439 --> 33:50.607
just until
we get you better.

34:04.723 --> 34:06.456
Well, there she is.

34:08.327 --> 34:10.060
It's actually
kind of comfortable.

34:10.062 --> 34:13.130
Uh, and its best feature
is that it's warded,

34:13.132 --> 34:17.067
so it keeps your powers
below the meltdown level.

34:17.069 --> 34:19.803
Yeah, so you
can't hurt anyone...

34:19.804 --> 34:22.639
and n-nobody can hurt you.

34:25.610 --> 34:27.177
I understand.

34:31.449 --> 34:34.016
So, uh...

34:39.692 --> 34:41.190
Okay.

34:49.868 --> 34:53.337
Um, do I just --

34:53.339 --> 34:54.638
Just hop on in.

35:12.391 --> 35:15.626
Hm. Not bad.

35:15.628 --> 35:17.327
Hey. Told ya.

35:20.566 --> 35:22.466
How long before
I can come out?

35:22.468 --> 35:26.436
Not too long.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.576
Jack, we got this.

35:43.088 --> 35:44.354
Okay.

36:22.683 --> 36:24.316
Are you guys still there?

36:24.773 --> 36:25.905
Sam?!

36:25.907 --> 36:27.106
Dean?!

36:34.949 --> 36:36.349
Sam?

36:41.456 --> 36:44.190
Sam?

36:47.595 --> 36:51.397
Dean? You still there?

36:57.105 --> 36:58.538
So what do we do now?

36:58.540 --> 37:04.310
Just...go on with Jack
locked up in there forever?

37:05.380 --> 37:06.546
If we have to.

37:08.817 --> 37:10.650
I don't know
if I can do that.

37:14.122 --> 37:17.356
I tell you what. This stuff
Ketch left, it's not bad.

37:26.334 --> 37:29.168
You know, I never thought it
would end like this with Jack.

37:29.170 --> 37:31.471
Sammy, we knew
from the beginning

37:31.473 --> 37:33.106
it was a long shot
with him.

37:35.009 --> 37:38.077
Yeah.

37:38.079 --> 37:41.481
Yeah, but long shots
are kind of our thing.

37:47.088 --> 37:49.655
Guys?

37:49.657 --> 37:52.425
I don't think I like this!

37:52.427 --> 37:54.360
Look at you, buddy.

37:54.362 --> 37:58.431
Ahh.
You got played, man.

37:58.433 --> 38:01.734
Uh, I got to hand it
to the Winchesters.

38:01.736 --> 38:03.202
They still got game.

38:03.204 --> 38:06.072
They -- They said
I should trust them.

38:07.842 --> 38:09.442
And you believed
that crap?

38:09.444 --> 38:13.546
Buddy, buddy, trust
is a two-way street, man.

38:13.548 --> 38:17.550
If they trusted you,
why did they lock you up?

38:17.552 --> 38:20.887
You, my friend,
are screwed.

38:25.260 --> 38:29.395
Sam. Dean.
There's news.

38:29.397 --> 38:32.465
Dumah was manipulating Jack
into doing those things.

38:32.467 --> 38:34.901
She told him
it would please you.

38:34.903 --> 38:36.736
Oh, so now
it's <i>our</i> fault?

38:36.738 --> 38:39.739
I'm just saying it's urgent
that we find him and tell him.

38:39.741 --> 38:42.008
Cass, he's here.

38:43.144 --> 38:44.410
What?

38:44.412 --> 38:47.880
He's locked up, safe.

38:47.882 --> 38:49.415
He's in the Ma'lak box.

38:49.417 --> 38:51.384
No!

38:51.386 --> 38:53.486
And that's where
he's gonna stay.

38:57.559 --> 38:59.625
Am I getting
through to you?

38:59.627 --> 39:02.128
Did they tell you the specifics
of their "cure"?

39:02.130 --> 39:04.163
Are you getting
a new soul?

39:04.165 --> 39:06.766
Does it have
a factory warranty?

39:06.768 --> 39:09.302
Why didn't they tell you
how much time it would take?

39:11.272 --> 39:12.572
I don't know.

39:12.574 --> 39:14.974
You don't know
because you, my friend,

39:14.976 --> 39:18.911
are naive,
clueless, trusting.

39:18.913 --> 39:21.514
And you know what?
They suckered you.

39:21.516 --> 39:23.416
"Why," you may ask?
Okay.

39:23.418 --> 39:26.752
One, 'cause you're
no longer useful to them.

39:26.754 --> 39:29.188
And, two, you killed
their mother.

39:29.190 --> 39:31.824
Okay? There's no
coming back from that.

39:31.826 --> 39:35.294
So <i>this</i> is it,
for the rest of time.

39:50.612 --> 39:53.679
I'm sorry. Is that it?

39:55.283 --> 39:57.883
You have to do way better
than that, buddy.

39:57.885 --> 39:59.785
Even after hearing
what I said,

39:59.787 --> 40:04.056
you want to keep Jack sealed
in a living death?

40:04.058 --> 40:06.459
He agreed to it.

40:06.461 --> 40:08.561
Because deep down,
I think he knows it's best.

40:08.563 --> 40:12.999
No. You're doing what Dumah --
You are manipulating him.

40:15.069 --> 40:17.370
Bring it.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.693
Cass.

40:40.695 --> 40:42.261
What? You just want
to forget about him?

40:42.263 --> 40:45.031
I wish I could forget about him!
After what he did?

40:45.033 --> 40:48.067
And you know what he can do.
This is our only play.

41:30.278 --> 41:31.744
Jack.
