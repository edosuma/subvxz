WEBVTT

00:12.554 --> 00:13.805
Prescription for Adderall.

00:13.889 --> 00:16.391
-You found this in Edgar's pocket?
-Yeah.

00:16.475 --> 00:19.019
And Grace told us that Edgar
wasn't taking pharmaceuticals.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.605
And let me guess,
you think Grace is lying.

00:21.688 --> 00:25.359
What? No, of course not. Unless you do.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.237
-No.
-Well, yeah, me either. I-- We agree.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.073
Yeah. Well,
Edgar also had this weird third cuff link.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.617
Edgar was already wearing cuff links.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.661
Exactly. So, whose cuff link is that?

00:35.744 --> 00:38.497
Well, this cuff link has a G on it for…

00:40.040 --> 00:41.333
not Grace.

00:41.416 --> 00:42.835
Yep, I know that.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.295
There are a lot of things
that start with G.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.091
All I know is find the other cuff link,

00:49.174 --> 00:51.510
-find the killer.
-That's good.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.972
I mean, I'm not entirely sure I follow,
but you did find the time of death,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.557
-and that's huge.
-Thank you.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.685
Thirty-five minutes after
Grace took Edgar to bed, he's dead.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.270
Whatever killed him, killed him fast.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.938
So now I just gotta figure out who did it.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.649
-Aniq, you coming?
-All right. Well, I should go.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.733
Okay.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.404
-You should take these off. Totally.
-Yeah, can you take this?

01:10.487 --> 01:12.030
-And then maybe get the-- No.
-Yeah. Got it.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.157
And don't put your hand in it
'cause it's very sweaty.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.017
This whole thing is so much more
complex than you guys realize.

02:22.100 --> 02:28.482
Everything in that folder adds up to
a hidden scheme with Edgar at the center.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.983
Now, if you give me an hour,

02:30.067 --> 02:35.572
and if we could get a blank wall
and maybe, like, 300 thumbtacks--

02:36.573 --> 02:38.825
You're one of those conspiracy guys.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.036
-Truth guys.
-Here's a truth.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.622
You told Edgar
he was gonna die last night.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.290
That was taken out of context.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.125
I-- Once again, the folder would prove--

02:47.209 --> 02:49.211
Yeah, we'll keep the folder, okay?

02:49.294 --> 02:52.172
And you talk to us, Travis…

02:52.256 --> 02:53.507
Gladrise.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.967
Gladrise.

02:55.050 --> 02:59.429
Well, Mr. Gladrise,
you've been acting a little…

03:00.013 --> 03:02.099
super weird all weekend.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.226
Skulking around, obsessed with Grace.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.979
I am not obsessed with Grace.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.606
I have a girlfriend. In Poland.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.775
Why do you have all this?

03:11.859 --> 03:14.736
The truth is that Edgar is a crumb.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.574
-And Grace knows that I'm…
-What's that?

03:18.657 --> 03:20.325
Pretty handy with a broom.
That was a broom.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.411
That's how I could tell
you've never swept before.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.495
Looks like a lightsaber.

03:23.579 --> 03:27.416
She literally invited me to look into it.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.587
Delivered via Pony Express.

03:35.007 --> 03:39.469
My tale begins in a 10-by-15
of drywall and hard luck.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.473
I was on my own as an online private dick.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.976
I answer the questions Google can't.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.645
Mucking around in a place
where no one feels lucky,

03:48.729 --> 03:50.105
the dark web.

03:50.189 --> 03:55.277
A seedy bazaar where a digital hood
can find just about any brand of vice.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.113
Guns, dope, orphan parts.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.615
-Poison?
-Oh, yeah.

03:59.698 --> 04:04.536
I mean, no. I mean, yes, but no, not me.
My lay is information.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.873
I had this feeling
when I got to the office

04:07.956 --> 04:09.666
there'd be a case waiting for me.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.335
Or a woman.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.337
Turns out, it was both.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.839
-Mom!
-Yes, dear?

04:15.923 --> 04:20.302
-Did I get any mail today?
-On your chair, honey.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.845
Thanks, Mom!

04:39.530 --> 04:40.531
Grace.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.950
Never thought I'd hear from her again.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.578
We had a little number
back in the late good times.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.330
She was a good kid,

04:48.914 --> 04:51.458
back in our carefree steampunk days.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.173
Question now was,

04:58.257 --> 05:01.468
why would Grace summon an old flame
to her wedding altar?

05:01.552 --> 05:02.678
A cry for help?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.680
Had to be.

05:04.763 --> 05:10.477
So I put her intended's chassis on blocks
and tinkered with his undercarriage.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.126
And there it was.

05:34.209 --> 05:38.005
Grace's soon-to-be plus-one
had launched his own cryptocurrency.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.424
You see, there's this thing
called the blockchain--

05:40.507 --> 05:41.925
Uh-uh. Stop, no.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.761
-Aniq, do you understand this blockchain?
-Well, yes.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.264
You see, there's a ledger. Basically,
that's the-- Individual blocks--

05:47.347 --> 05:50.017
No. Don't care. As long as you know it,

05:50.100 --> 05:51.435
-I don't have to know it.
-Yeah.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.813
-Carry on.
-The legacy banking system is rigged

05:54.897 --> 05:56.231
for corporations,

05:56.315 --> 05:58.734
so crypto was supposed
to be the great equalizer.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.028
Till the scammers came in.

06:01.111 --> 06:04.406
I know this because I fell for one of 'em.

06:04.907 --> 06:05.908
A scam.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.287
That mook took every last dollar I had.

06:10.871 --> 06:14.875
So when I saw that invite
I saw a second chance.

06:14.958 --> 06:19.421
You know, I couldn't go back
and stop the man behind CoinusInterruptus,

06:19.505 --> 06:22.007
but maybe I could stop Edgar
from getting away with it.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.634
Getting away with what?

06:23.717 --> 06:24.801
It's all there in the folder.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.554
The five biggest investors

06:27.638 --> 06:32.392
in Edgar's crypto coin
are shell companies owned by Edgar.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.853
-That's not good.
-Why is that not good?

06:34.937 --> 06:36.730
Well, he's saying
that Edgar used his own money

06:36.813 --> 06:38.899
to artificially inflate the value
of his crypto.

06:38.982 --> 06:39.900
Yahtzee.

06:39.983 --> 06:44.947
And the proof was right there
in that RSVP.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.365
-Do you mind?
-Go ahead.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.419
What the fuck?

06:59.503 --> 07:01.672
"Tech scam."

07:01.755 --> 07:05.384
Okay, so you think that Grace left
a secret code for you

07:05.467 --> 07:07.302
in the food choices of the wedding invite?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.097
He cute.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.182
Keno, baby.

07:14.059 --> 07:17.771
Edgar was as dirty
as the boots on a box turtle.

07:17.855 --> 07:21.817
Grace knew it,
and she knew she needed me to prove it.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.779
Mom, I'm going to a wedding!

07:25.863 --> 07:28.240
I can't hear you. I'm in the tub.

07:43.046 --> 07:46.425
I know I sometimes say the wrong thing,

07:46.925 --> 07:50.596
but you know I'm just trying
to help, right?

07:53.265 --> 07:54.266
Okay.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.145
Okay, actually I do need your help.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.981
I can't get out of this dress,
and it's like--

08:01.064 --> 08:03.692
Like, look at how many buttons there are.
It's like a straitjacket.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.652
-And I--
-Yeah, let's get you out of it.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.070
Yeah, great.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.907
So, how did the rest of it go?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.575
With Aniq and Danner.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.744
Yeah, really good.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.830
I'd say really-- like, okay. It was fine.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.751
Yeah, it was really bad.
I think I'm gonna go to jail.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.461
-Okay, I think I can help you.
-No.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.713
No. I know, but I have a lead.

08:25.714 --> 08:26.840
Does this look familiar to you?

08:26.924 --> 08:28.300
I found it on Edgar.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.718
-What's that?
-It's a cuff link.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.512
It was in his pocket when he died.

08:32.804 --> 08:33.972
I have a theory.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.933
Find the cuff link, find the killer.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.393
Yeah, it's not a cuff link.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.979
-It's a typewriter key.
-What?

08:43.148 --> 08:45.442
Wait, why would he have a typewriter key?

08:45.526 --> 08:46.527
Hannah.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.030
-She collects typewriters.
-Oh, my God, she would.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.573
Okay, let's go. New lead.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.409
-Where?
-To Hannah's big, dumb tent.

08:54.493 --> 08:55.786
To see if she's missing a G key.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.914
-Okay, but what would it prove?
-That she knows something.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.918
Find the missing typewriter key,
find the killer.

09:03.669 --> 09:04.878
It's not as catchy.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.630
-No.
-Find the--

09:07.214 --> 09:08.715
-G-spot--
-What?

09:09.383 --> 09:13.095
Okay. I will go, but clearly just because
you need my help more than I need yours.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.556
Like, it's not called a tent.
It's called a yurt.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.016
Oh, my God.
It's like we're the Hardy sisters.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.893
You're too young.

09:19.977 --> 09:20.978
Okay.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.646
In the interest of full disclosure,

09:22.729 --> 09:24.898
I should reveal that while I was invited
to the wedding,

09:24.982 --> 09:28.318
I was not invited to the rehearsal dinner.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.570
That I was crashing.

09:48.839 --> 09:49.840
Wow.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.102
She was just as I remembered her.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.605
Minus the brass goggles
and leather duster.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.107
-Travis.
-I got your message, baby.

10:07.191 --> 10:08.317
You mean the invitation?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.943
All's I know is it had my name on it.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.695
Surprised you actually came.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.447
She had fear in her eyes.

10:13.530 --> 10:17.910
Not fear like there's a scary clown
in my window, but dread.

10:18.535 --> 10:23.498
I got an inkling as to why
you fed that analog e-vite to my mailbox.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.542
Well, I was hoping you'd read
between the lines.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.419
That's the only place I read, baby.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.005
Grace.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.799
I have to go.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.676
I was on the case.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.221
This place was a nest of dormy birds.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.014
Time to see who I could get to squawk.

10:39.598 --> 10:40.849
Hey there, stretch.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.727
Something's up around here and it stinks.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.812
You keep your ears open,

10:45.896 --> 10:47.981
got a couple of hams with your name on it.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.068
Hamilton-- Sawbucks.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.819
Ten-spots.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.988
I don't know how to help you.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.784
Hey, I don't deal in crypto.

10:59.368 --> 11:02.162
My game is ice.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.207
Dangerous game.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.544
I knew an iceman myself,
guy by the name of Eddie Canino.

11:08.627 --> 11:11.004
His online handle was "the iceman cumeth."

11:11.588 --> 11:15.342
But cum spelled with a U.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.427
I'm gonna talk to somebody else.

11:18.011 --> 11:22.432
I kept striking out,
so I decided to get closer to the source.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.560
He's up to something, isn't he?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.270
Your firstborn.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.399
What do you know about it?

11:30.482 --> 11:32.818
I know about cryptocurrency, lady.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.529
Webcheddar, cybercabbage.

11:36.071 --> 11:40.033
And your face tells me you're waist-deep
in the same dirty deal as your womb-fruit.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.120
That felt like an answer.

11:44.454 --> 11:47.332
I only got two chee--
Talking about crypto.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.418
I'm running out of cheeks.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.211
Fuck.

11:52.504 --> 11:56.550
How dare you wear white at a wedding.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.142
Where's the iceman when you need him?

12:17.779 --> 12:19.281
Good evening, amigo.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.868
-Got a moniker?
-The name's Aniq.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.120
I'm a puzzle master. You?

12:25.204 --> 12:28.916
Professional know-it-all by another name.
What's your rumpus?

12:29.791 --> 12:31.543
I'm fixin' to steal the sister
of the bride away

12:31.627 --> 12:33.253
from little Lord Fish-and-Chips.

12:36.757 --> 12:37.799
I can't help you with that,

12:37.883 --> 12:40.594
but I do got a riddle for you,
Stanley H. Sphinx.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.763
What's a squirrel like Edgar,

12:42.846 --> 12:44.681
with all the acorns in the world,

12:44.765 --> 12:47.726
doing dipping his maw
in the crypto trough?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.102
Time to switch tables.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.355
Switch tables? That a code?

12:53.857 --> 12:56.443
That was definitely a code.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.820
It wasn't a code.
Just wanted to switch tables.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.864
You made that very clear.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.952
Well, no. No, don't wink.
It wasn't a code.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.787
It was a code.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.623
I was getting nowhere fast.

13:09.706 --> 13:13.210
Then the nowhere-fast found me.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.379
-Spare me a minute, Charley?
-What?

13:16.797 --> 13:18.465
She was all trouble.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.303
The kind of dame
who smashes your heart into little pieces

13:23.387 --> 13:27.891
like you'd find in a puzzle too confusing
for your cousin's idiot twins.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.852
Well, aren't you a box of goodies.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.689
You're quite the taffy sampler yourself.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.941
Here I come.

13:36.608 --> 13:41.113
Gosh, I love how your hair sticks to
your head in all these unexpected places.

13:41.738 --> 13:45.242
It's like spaghetti
that's been cooked to high hell.

13:47.286 --> 13:49.079
Yeah, well, you've got a nose

13:49.580 --> 13:55.460
that looks like an ice pick stuck
in a Jeep's trunk.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.343
Yes. You're a riot.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.055
What do you say you and me,
we get out of here?

14:07.556 --> 14:09.725
We pop some hoobidy-doobidy fun-petals

14:09.808 --> 14:12.644
and kiss each other's faces and so forth.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.774
-How do you know the couple?
-Sister of the bridegroom.

14:18.442 --> 14:19.610
Adopted.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.486
I see where your loyalties are buttered.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.696
W--

14:23.572 --> 14:24.990
And for the record,

14:25.908 --> 14:27.868
I don't have a boner right now.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.328
That was a lie.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.954
My luck wasn't the only thing

14:31.038 --> 14:32.080
that was hard.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.250
I won't write that down.

14:35.334 --> 14:36.710
You was a only child, huh?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.046
Yes, very intuitive.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.172
Thank you.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.385
Then fortune's merry-go-round
spun its carousel horse my way.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.305
Ladies and gentlemen, Uncle Ulysses.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.558
Funcle Ulysses.

15:16.792 --> 15:21.046
So while the rest of the mopes
were distracted by a two-bit pony show,

15:21.129 --> 15:24.508
I decided to slip in fresco
for some hard evidence.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.412
All right.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.711
What have we got here?

16:00.794 --> 16:02.588
Pilot's license.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.048
Issued a month ago.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.510
Looks like Minnows is a flying fish.

16:13.223 --> 16:14.850
List of names.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.186
Accomplices maybe.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.939
Come on.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.153
He had books on disappearing,

16:26.236 --> 16:29.907
close-up magic
and an Italian called Houdini.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.783
What does him being Italian
have to do with anything?

16:31.867 --> 16:34.953
Exactly. These are the questions.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.748
Patagonia, eh?

16:40.042 --> 16:42.461
And what in high hell are you doing
in here?

16:42.544 --> 16:45.005
I was caught phone-handed.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.549
Weren't trying to break into that safe,
were we, old boy?

16:48.592 --> 16:51.345
Several hundred million dollars
of crypto in there.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.013
I had to play dumb.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.598
What safe?

16:56.475 --> 16:57.851
Well, that safe.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.437
The one
that quite clearly looks like a safe.

17:00.521 --> 17:01.647
That. Yeah.

17:02.231 --> 17:06.484
Don't play silly sausages with me.
What are you doing in here?

17:06.568 --> 17:08.403
Don't make me beat it out of you.

17:08.904 --> 17:11.865
No one wants to see a man shit his pants
in a white suit.

17:12.991 --> 17:18.789
I'm here to purchase a few fingers
of Edgar's crypto,

17:18.872 --> 17:22.209
and I thought you might be able
to spread me some.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.337
I know all about Bookie-Phallus.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.214
I beg your pardon?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.218
It's "Bucephalus."

17:31.301 --> 17:32.261
Yeah.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.596
Edgar named it after
Alexander the Great's horse.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.558
You see, his father was obsessed with…

17:40.352 --> 17:43.313
The name of the horse. Of course.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.734
I already knew that
that was the name of the horse!

17:48.318 --> 17:50.487
I just couldn't pronounce it
because I'm a reader.

17:50.571 --> 17:53.699
I knew I had to get out
before someone else came in.

17:54.491 --> 17:57.035
I also knew I had to have a go
at that safe.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.207
It was uncrackable.

18:06.920 --> 18:11.049
Then I remembered the deaf lady upstairs
in my building who I cat-sit for.

18:11.133 --> 18:15.095
She kept her passwords written down
on a Post-it in her desk.

18:15.179 --> 18:16.763
And there it was.

18:16.847 --> 18:20.100
Okay. Wow. You know,
this is definitely a code.

18:20.184 --> 18:23.145
It's like you said, Aniq. "Switch tables."

18:23.228 --> 18:24.438
What? No. That's not what I--

18:24.521 --> 18:28.108
"S-E-C-4." What does it mean?

18:28.192 --> 18:32.196
Securities and Exchange Commission four?

18:32.279 --> 18:34.615
I just can't seem to work it out.

18:34.698 --> 18:37.701
Don't sweat it, pal.
I already cracked the ciph.

18:44.416 --> 18:47.127
I knew that code
was the key to Edgar's scheme.

18:48.629 --> 18:49.755
But I couldn't see it yet.

18:52.966 --> 18:56.261
Bucephalus. Macedonian horse.

18:56.345 --> 19:00.182
Like a Trojan horse. Horse on the outside,
what's on the inside?

19:00.849 --> 19:02.976
Trojan horse had people inside.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.853
So what's inside this horse?

19:07.439 --> 19:09.024
More horse.

19:10.776 --> 19:13.028
More horse. Morse.

19:24.248 --> 19:25.249
Morse code.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.321
"Death."

19:58.365 --> 19:59.783
"Freedom."

20:00.367 --> 20:01.785
I got you, you bastard.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.204
It's all there.

20:04.288 --> 20:06.456
Edgar was going to fake his own death,

20:06.540 --> 20:08.584
and he was going
to take the money he would make

20:08.667 --> 20:10.919
from his artificially juiced crypto.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.255
And this list of potential names?

20:13.338 --> 20:16.508
No, it is not accomplices
as I had previously thought.

20:16.592 --> 20:20.596
They're new identities that he was going
to take on and just go vanish.

20:20.679 --> 20:26.393
Just disappear as
"Mason Matsushima" or "Pat Strickland."

20:27.895 --> 20:29.563
Aniq, is that right?

20:29.646 --> 20:31.106
I mean, I don't know that it's wrong.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.817
But this "Morse-more-horse" thing
is making me feel like it is.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.362
You guys really don't believe me.

20:37.446 --> 20:38.488
Okay.

20:40.490 --> 20:44.244
Are you saying Edgar, who is dead,
faked his own death?

20:44.328 --> 20:46.121
No, but he was planning to.

20:47.539 --> 20:50.125
Marrying Grace was part
of Edgar's plan.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.252
She'd be his legally bound patsy,

20:52.753 --> 20:55.422
left to take the heat
for his Bucephalus bunco.

20:56.048 --> 20:59.092
I had to warn Grace
before she took the big plunge.

21:00.511 --> 21:02.262
But I couldn't do it alone.

21:02.346 --> 21:04.014
And I wouldn't have to.

21:04.890 --> 21:05.891
Hello, Chazwell.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.685
Couldn't stay away?

21:09.311 --> 21:10.354
Where's Grace?

21:10.854 --> 21:11.980
Under lock and key.

21:12.064 --> 21:14.274
Your sibling-on-paper's pulling
an exit scam.

21:14.358 --> 21:17.986
Set to leave my ex-girl high and dry
with the phony crypto fallout.

21:18.070 --> 21:18.904
What do you care?

21:18.987 --> 21:21.406
I'm gonna save Grace,
and I'm gonna stop this wedding.

21:21.490 --> 21:23.617
Wouldn't mind stopping
this wedding myself.

21:25.577 --> 21:26.578
Wanna join me?

21:32.793 --> 21:35.587
Now see here, Charlez.
I'm piloting this nuptial spitfire.

21:35.671 --> 21:38.924
I can steer the ship any way we need.
So I say the word, you drop the bomb.

21:39.007 --> 21:39.842
Sounds Jake.

21:39.925 --> 21:43.762
So you're saying Hannah
wanted to stop her brother's wedding?

21:44.596 --> 21:45.973
What did she have against Grace?

21:46.056 --> 21:47.975
Or what did she have against Edgar?

21:56.233 --> 21:57.609
Yeah, okay.

22:02.614 --> 22:06.159
What in the world is all this?

22:06.243 --> 22:07.369
Yeah.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.162
Hannah has a lot of hobbies.

22:09.246 --> 22:12.833
Okay, find a missing G key.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.042
Hey, Zo?

22:14.126 --> 22:16.086
-Yeah?
-You know, on your last murder…

22:16.670 --> 22:18.463
-Don't say it like that.
-I didn't mean it like that.

22:19.173 --> 22:21.341
How did Aniq and Danner catch the killer?

22:22.426 --> 22:25.095
Little things. Discrepancies in stories.

22:25.179 --> 22:26.972
In the end,
it was all about finding out why.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.349
Which is what we're after here.
Hannah's motive.

22:29.433 --> 22:30.434
We'll figure it out.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.187
Oh, my God. Look!

22:33.270 --> 22:37.107
It's a match. This is Hannah's G key.

22:38.859 --> 22:40.027
Shit.

22:40.903 --> 22:44.323
What? Okay, it's Hannah.
She's coming. What do we do?

22:44.406 --> 22:45.949
Is she holding the dead lizard?

22:46.033 --> 22:47.075
-Hide.
-Shit.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.327
Can't see? Nope. Stupid.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.079
-Okay. I'll go under-- I can't--
-Get it off me.

22:52.039 --> 22:53.040
Wait. There's a window.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.166
-Window.
-Yes. Wise.

22:55.501 --> 22:56.710
Go.

22:58.712 --> 22:59.713
Oh, my God.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.799
Zoë. Quiet.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.552
Go.

23:09.306 --> 23:10.849
Okay, I don't think she saw us.

23:10.933 --> 23:11.975
We're in the clear.

23:12.059 --> 23:14.436
But what are you up to, missy?

23:15.354 --> 23:16.355
What's the point?

23:16.438 --> 23:20.192
None of this matters. When the cops come,
they're still gonna arrest me.

23:20.275 --> 23:22.194
Okay. See,
this is why I have to look out for you.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.488
Because you refuse
to look out for yourself.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.783
Stop it. That's what I'm talking about.
This "big sister to the rescue."

23:28.283 --> 23:32.538
Yeah. Well, I am gonna rescue you.
With or without your stupid help.

23:33.038 --> 23:36.458
Hey, Zoë. Be careful.
Some of those plants are poisonous.

23:40.838 --> 23:41.880
What did you just say?

23:41.964 --> 23:44.424
I said, some of those plants are p--

23:45.509 --> 23:49.888
So, you and Hannah were set out to
stop the wedding.

23:49.972 --> 23:51.890
That was the plan, Jack.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.226
But the plan was a risky one.

23:54.309 --> 23:59.064
I'd be laying on Edgar's train tracks,
nude and shivering as danger raced my way.

24:05.070 --> 24:08.907
A snap of his fingers
and I'd be in a wooden kimono.

24:10.367 --> 24:11.994
He was onto me.

24:12.786 --> 24:15.038
I needed a fall guy. A stoolie.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.542
Excuse me.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.546
How would you like to walk outta here
with a pocketful of hams?

24:23.338 --> 24:28.468
When I give you the word,
you stand and read this. Got it?

24:29.011 --> 24:30.012
No.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.017
Four hams, you yammer as my proxy.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.228
-No.
-Six hams. That's a lot of lettuce.

24:41.231 --> 24:45.110
Your handwriting is so poor.
Does that say "blockchain"?

24:45.694 --> 24:47.154
Yeah, so there's this ledger.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.114
Oh, my God.

24:49.198 --> 24:51.366
We don't have time. You're ruining
the ruining of this wedding.

24:51.450 --> 24:55.787
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

24:55.871 --> 24:56.872
No.

24:59.791 --> 25:03.170
There was no signal.
It was a double cross.

25:07.925 --> 25:10.886
Sorry, Chucky. Snake eyes for us both.

25:11.845 --> 25:14.097
So Hannah didn't want to stop the wedding?

25:14.765 --> 25:17.017
She was either in on it from the top
or Edgar got to her.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.435
I'm still not sure which.

25:18.519 --> 25:21.396
But I know that if I couldn't stop Grace
from marrying Edgar,

25:22.105 --> 25:25.734
maybe I could at least stop him from
running off and screwing her over.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.454
Sorry, friend. This is staff only.

25:37.538 --> 25:38.997
Official business.

25:39.081 --> 25:42.125
Need a line of sight.
There's a crime about to go down.

25:43.043 --> 25:44.294
What kind of crime?

25:44.378 --> 25:47.464
The kinda crime you smell for miles,
but you gotta get up close to see.

25:48.674 --> 25:50.008
I'm about to bust it up.

25:53.095 --> 25:54.096
Where's he going?

25:54.596 --> 25:56.682
This was it. His escape plan.

25:56.765 --> 26:00.102
Edgar was running straight
from the dance floor to sunny Patagonia.

26:00.769 --> 26:03.355
Hey! Off of the floor. Have some dignity.

26:03.438 --> 26:05.065
I'm looking for something.

26:05.148 --> 26:06.191
Aren't we all?

26:08.068 --> 26:09.987
-You again.
-They're doing the jitterbug.

26:10.070 --> 26:12.948
Jitterbug-shmitterbug.
Jitterbug's just a fad.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.074
You're a bunch of sheep!

26:29.214 --> 26:31.967
You know what they say
about hot stoves, don't ya?

26:32.467 --> 26:33.635
Get too close…

26:35.971 --> 26:38.515
and you'll burn your pubes off.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.270
So, you fell?

26:43.353 --> 26:46.648
Oh, no. Clubbed in the back of the head.
Lights out.

26:47.316 --> 26:48.317
Or you fell.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.862
I think I was getting a little
too close to the truth.

26:51.945 --> 26:54.364
And when I woke up…

27:01.205 --> 27:03.665
Edgar. Where's Edgar Minnows?

27:04.416 --> 27:06.668
Forget it, Jake. Party's over.

27:12.257 --> 27:17.304
I'd blown it. Edgar was gone.
And worse, I'd dropped the ball for Grace.

27:17.387 --> 27:20.933
So I headed inside to find a couch
or a soft table to crash on.

27:22.351 --> 27:24.520
Maybe a quart of gin on the way there.

27:27.356 --> 27:29.274
Pour me a jigger, Shetland Sam.

27:29.858 --> 27:33.070
Not on the clock, Johnny Rock.
Sling your own Singapore.

27:40.077 --> 27:42.538
That's not hygienic.

27:45.123 --> 27:46.542
Have a seat, Mother.

27:47.543 --> 27:48.877
And there he was.

27:49.461 --> 27:51.213
I know what you're up to, Edgar.

27:51.713 --> 27:52.965
He was still here.

27:53.465 --> 27:56.844
I wasn't about to let that moment pass.
Not this time.

27:58.387 --> 28:00.055
You're gonna die tonight.

28:04.893 --> 28:06.854
At least, that's what
the world's gonna think.

28:08.063 --> 28:12.651
Whether there's no trace, or whether
we discover the body of some drifter

28:13.652 --> 28:17.739
who you were kind enough to give a final
meal of lobster potpie and flat cola.

28:17.823 --> 28:22.494
By the time that corpse is cold,
you'll have hightailed it to Patagonia

28:23.662 --> 28:28.166
and assumed the identity of a one
Carlos Bustamante, MBA.

28:30.127 --> 28:37.050
I am sick and tired of you fat cats
who make doo-doo pies

28:37.134 --> 28:42.055
in our bowls of clam chowder and
try to pass it off as saltine crackers.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.101
I had my entire life stripped from me,

28:47.936 --> 28:49.521
from a scammer like you.

28:49.605 --> 28:54.443
And I will jump off the Bay Bridge
before I see that done to Grace.

28:56.236 --> 28:58.197
You think death is freedom?

28:58.947 --> 29:04.119
Well, your so-called death will certainly
be your last day of freedom, Buster Brown.

29:04.203 --> 29:06.163
Because no matter where you run to,

29:06.246 --> 29:08.999
I will hunt you
to every plane of existence

29:09.583 --> 29:13.045
to ensure that you never,
ever get away with it!

29:17.716 --> 29:20.969
You, sir, are melting.

29:21.762 --> 29:23.805
-Bloop.
-The fuck?

29:24.389 --> 29:25.516
So that's your play, huh?

29:25.599 --> 29:26.892
Melt your own head?

29:26.975 --> 29:30.312
Your face looks like one of those
hot clocks from that Spaniard's painting.

29:30.395 --> 29:32.731
Well, I'm sorry, Dalí,
but this guy ain't buying it.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.316
I don't know what you speak of.

29:34.942 --> 29:36.318
Now your horns are growing.

29:38.237 --> 29:39.530
-Devil.
-Stop it.

29:39.613 --> 29:40.989
-You're a devil!
-That's enough.

29:41.073 --> 29:43.700
-Stop. Stop it.
-He's a devil! You're all devils!

29:43.784 --> 29:45.494
-Stop it.
-Demony little devils.

29:45.577 --> 29:48.705
-Stop. Okay.
-Baskerville rides in the nighttime.

29:48.789 --> 29:51.041
-Hey, you're okay.
-Hey, don't fall for it, Grace.

29:51.124 --> 29:52.584
It's too late. Isn't it?

29:57.214 --> 29:58.173
Regards.

29:58.674 --> 29:59.675
I'm so sorry.

30:02.636 --> 30:04.304
The knight is wearing skorts.

30:04.388 --> 30:06.014
-Definitely.
-That's progress.

30:06.098 --> 30:08.100
-Good job.
-Thank you for your service.

30:08.183 --> 30:11.687
-Don't touch the--
-Stop herding me.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.275
I'm in no condition to make whoopee.

30:17.609 --> 30:19.403
I wasn't buying Edgar's little show.

30:19.486 --> 30:22.948
But if he was looking to escape,
I'd be right there waiting for him.

30:23.699 --> 30:26.159
After all,
I was Grace's knight in shining…

30:26.827 --> 30:27.828
that.

30:31.039 --> 30:33.834
Yeah, right. Just in case.

30:33.917 --> 30:37.337
Lucky for me,
I always have pistachios in my pockets.

30:37.421 --> 30:40.549
The perfect snack and the perfect trap.

30:41.049 --> 30:45.262
If he tried to escape tonight,
I'd hear every crunch of his footsteps.

30:45.345 --> 30:49.725
You and me, pal.
Gonna stand guard all night.

30:51.226 --> 30:53.187
I'll take the first shift.

31:01.403 --> 31:02.404
Grace.

31:04.990 --> 31:05.991
Help!

31:09.077 --> 31:09.995
Grace.

31:12.372 --> 31:13.749
It's Edgar.

31:13.832 --> 31:18.045
Edgar, he's dead. He's dead.

31:19.004 --> 31:20.130
He's dead.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.389
So, you were wrong.

31:29.473 --> 31:32.518
-Edgar wasn't trying to escape.
-No, he was trying to escape.

31:32.601 --> 31:35.729
But before he could fake his own death,
someone killed him.

31:35.812 --> 31:39.608
I don't know, Travis. I mean,
you're basing all that on "tech scampi"

31:39.691 --> 31:41.068
and "more horse."

31:42.069 --> 31:43.987
You know how all this sounds, right?

31:44.071 --> 31:46.990
No, yeah. I know how I sound.

31:48.242 --> 31:49.451
I'm the loser, right?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.663
I'm the sucker who got tricked
out of all his own money.

31:54.873 --> 31:57.709
I'm not dumb though.
You know, I know stuff.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.629
I know that Edgar was a bad man.

32:01.880 --> 32:06.134
He was using those shell companies
to dump cash to pump up his own crypto.

32:06.218 --> 32:10.889
I mean, he was not a good guy.
And it is all there.

32:10.973 --> 32:12.558
All the evidence is in that folder.

32:13.308 --> 32:17.729
I may have gone out on a limb
for some of it, true.

32:17.813 --> 32:22.150
But I knew he was still up to something.
I still know it.

32:23.819 --> 32:25.571
And I couldn't let him trick Grace.

32:26.905 --> 32:28.699
You know how special she is.

32:32.244 --> 32:34.913
Don't get me wrong. I am over her.

32:34.997 --> 32:36.415
I'm very happy with Weronika.

32:36.498 --> 32:39.751
But I still don't want to see
Grace get hurt.

32:42.921 --> 32:46.133
I couldn't just sit by and do nothing.

32:47.926 --> 32:49.136
I screwed up enough.

32:52.347 --> 32:53.682
I found the murder weapon.

32:53.765 --> 32:54.600
-You what?
-Where?

32:54.683 --> 32:56.101
Hannah's garden.

32:56.185 --> 32:59.479
I went over every flower in there
with this app that identifies plants.

32:59.563 --> 33:01.565
Three of them are poisonous if ingested.

33:02.524 --> 33:04.276
Do any of those three cause hallucination?

33:04.359 --> 33:07.112
'Cause I don't think that Edgar
was drunk at the after-party.

33:07.196 --> 33:09.573
You think he really saw people
turning into the devil?

33:09.656 --> 33:10.657
I mean, maybe.

33:11.158 --> 33:12.743
"Causes hallucinations." Just one.

33:12.826 --> 33:13.911
Okay.

33:13.994 --> 33:16.038
-"Datura stramonium."
-"Devil's trumpet."

33:16.121 --> 33:18.832
Oh, my God.
These flowers were in the centerpieces.

33:18.916 --> 33:21.668
See. "If mixed into tea,
it could cause hallucination."

33:21.752 --> 33:24.755
"And if strong enough,
30 minutes after you hallucinate…"

33:25.547 --> 33:27.883
-You die.
-You die.

33:29.468 --> 33:32.179
That tracks with the time of death
you found on Edgar's watch.

33:32.262 --> 33:35.265
And those flowers.
Somebody must've known. Who knew?

33:35.349 --> 33:37.351
The person that put together
those centerpieces

33:38.060 --> 33:41.813
and wanted to stop the wedding.
Before she didn't.
