00:47.756 --> 00:49.724
<i>Whose idea was this?</i>

00:49.883 --> 00:52.602
<i>What idea?
Meeting here.</i>

00:53.512 --> 00:55.105
Theirs.

00:55.264 --> 00:58.438
<i>Why?
It looks like we're dealing dope.</i>

00:59.810 --> 01:02.814
<i>You like listening to static?
It's tough getting FM, okay?</i>

01:02.980 --> 01:06.530
<i>Sure, under a fucking freeway
and high tension wires.</i>

01:06.692 --> 01:07.989
<i>These guys are late.</i>

01:08.151 --> 01:10.324
<i>What time did they say
they were gonna meet you?</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:12.410
<i>Seven.
Yeah, they're real late.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:15.292
<i>Okay, what do I do about it now?</i>

01:15.450 --> 01:19.171
<i>Why don't you just back up
and see if you can get K-EARTH?</i>

01:29.214 --> 01:33.185
<i>Boy, this is not too cool. He ought
to lower his brights, at least.</i>

01:33.343 --> 01:35.721
<i>Lights, goddamn it!</i>

01:35.887 --> 01:38.015
<i>Jesus Christ! We're
just meeting here...</i>

01:38.181 --> 01:39.899
<i>...to make sure we
weren't followed.</i>

01:44.813 --> 01:47.066
<i>Christ, how did I get here?</i>

01:51.570 --> 01:55.120
<i>He's got the cash.
Now we got to go weigh it and test it.</i>

01:55.282 --> 01:57.660
<i>Why not just do it
on the hood of the car?</i>

02:02.998 --> 02:04.625
Stop here.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.270
What are you looking at?

02:18.180 --> 02:19.853
Peanut shells.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.984
Right! Jesus!

02:27.147 --> 02:30.947
Go in the room and leave the door
unlocked. I'll be there in a minute.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.039
What were you doing in there?

03:20.784 --> 03:22.752
Who is it?
Answer it.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.584
It's Leland, man.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.297
Andy, how you doing, baby?
Great.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.966
Say hello to Nick.
Nick's my partner.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.435
Hold it.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.267
Who the fuck is that?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.314
It's a friend.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.693
He's not my friend.
And I got all the friends I need.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.068
He's my ride.
He drove me, that's all.

03:59.197 --> 04:02.701
Let him wait in the car.
I don't like meeting strangers.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.791
Look, he's just a friend of mine.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.421
Hey, that's cool.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.719
Just let me take a quick leak
and I'll be out of here.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.300
Deal's still good.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.927
How do you want
to weigh it and test it?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.892
We'll work it out, Andy.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.895
It's none of my business...

04:30.061 --> 04:33.861
...but I don't think you should be looking
for any new faces in your life, either.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.530
Fine with me. I'll wait outside.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.041
Hey.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.955
Pfft. I thought you retired.
I am retired.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.840
Then what are you doing here?
A favor.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.592
Oh, you mean a felony favor.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.594
A client paid him
with a pound of coke.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.926
He wanted me to hold his hand
while he sells it.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.762
Man, that is one flimsy fucking excuse.
Oh, yeah?

04:59.925 --> 05:03.680
He also tells me his customer asks more
questions about me than the dope.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.598
My phones have
funny little noises on them.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.859
You're setting me up, Nick.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.067
Not tonight, pal.
I got here by accident.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.029
Ha! Talk about a
flimsy fucking excuse!

05:16.233 --> 05:19.203
Later.
This is going down right now.

05:19.361 --> 05:23.457
And do yourself a favor.
Don't go back to the car.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.959
Don't you go back to the room.
There's no evidence.

05:26.117 --> 05:30.372
I'm sorry. I couldn't afford to have
him busted, as dumb as he is.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.212
He's my lawyer.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.519
Who authorized this shit?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.563
You did, lieutenant.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.448
Look, Nick,
that's what we were told, okay?

06:02.571 --> 06:04.073
What a waste of time.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.911
<i>Units 3,
4 and 5, return to parking lot.</i>

06:19.129 --> 06:20.802
<i>Units 6 and 7...</i>

06:20.964 --> 06:25.470
<i>...check all of the exits and the
stairwell. Look at those vents...</i>

06:25.635 --> 06:28.263
Got a runner
going across the freeway!

06:29.431 --> 06:32.435
Fucking A!
Forty-five minutes.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.690
It's the only fucking phone
I've ever met that don't...

07:16.770 --> 07:17.987
Get in there!

07:22.734 --> 07:25.738
<i>Vallenari's. Good evening.</i>
Hi, this is Dale McKussic.

07:25.904 --> 07:30.034
<i>Yeah, Mr. McKussic, I'm sorry.
It's a little noisy at the moment.</i>

07:30.241 --> 07:31.834
<i>Aren't we seeing you this evening?</i>

07:31.993 --> 07:34.462
I don't think
I'm gonna make my reservation.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.214
I'm gonna be a little late.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.796
<i>How late will you be?
Uh...</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:41.963
I don't know.
How late is the kitchen open?

08:13.368 --> 08:14.790
Tell me something, Hal.

08:15.036 --> 08:19.462
When you asked for my help, you didn't
know who you were asking me to bust?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.470
I knew who it was.
Why didn't you bust him?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.097
Well, you know that too.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.842
He's a friend of mine.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.890
The first thing I heard
when I came to L.A...

08:35.097 --> 08:38.398
...Nick wouldn't work South Bay because
he didn't wanna bust McKussic.

08:38.559 --> 08:42.405
Tonight you proved that point.
You not only let him walk...

08:42.605 --> 08:45.609
...you kicked him out and gave
him a personal escort. Why?

08:45.775 --> 08:50.497
Because you're predictable, Hal.
You're very predictable.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.794
Mac saw you coming a mile away.
How did you know he wasn't holding?

08:55.952 --> 08:58.296
Was Andy Leonard?
You busted him.

08:59.622 --> 09:04.128
Okay. No coke. No sale.
No conspiracy to sell.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.467
All you've got is a
lightweight conversation...

09:06.629 --> 09:08.631
...with a chickenshit
Century City lawyer.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.392
And a probable lawsuit
for entrapment.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.474
Mac's lawyers would make
mincemeat of you.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.685
I let him walk to save you
from a bad bust.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.108
Hal.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.607
I did you a favor.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.703
<i>How are you?</i>
<i>Fine, thank you.</i>

09:29.861 --> 09:31.738
What is it?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.204
It's McKussic.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.582
You're kidding.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.164
He's in and out of this
place all the time.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.543
Andy Leonard's the lawyer
for this restaurant.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.258
McKussic and the Vallenaris
talk drugs and money?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.011
They're real careful what they say.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.807
Let me hear.

09:53.885 --> 09:57.890
I told you, Nick, they're real careful.
I'm sure you're right. Could I hear?

09:58.056 --> 09:59.683
Yeah, sure!

10:01.059 --> 10:03.903
<i>In that case,
why don't I give you a taste...</i>

10:04.062 --> 10:05.939
<i>...of something different tonight?</i>

10:06.856 --> 10:08.483
<i>How about...</i>

10:09.359 --> 10:10.406
<i>...rigatoni?</i>

10:11.694 --> 10:14.538
<i>Rigatoni?
Rigatoni quattro formaggi.</i>

10:14.697 --> 10:16.699
<i>A creamy blend of
four Italian cheeses.</i>

10:16.866 --> 10:19.745
<i>Fontina, taleggio,
gorgonzola, and parmigiano.</i>

10:19.953 --> 10:21.375
<i>Sounds good.</i>

10:21.538 --> 10:23.586
Sounds good to me too.

10:23.873 --> 10:27.173
Look, before we spend another
five grand to hear Mac's dinner...

10:27.335 --> 10:29.929
...take my guys off the clock
and let me ask him.

10:30.088 --> 10:33.513
Unless you guarantee the Federal
government's picking up the tab tonight.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.640
Thanks.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.900
What's good here?

10:51.317 --> 10:53.570
Everything.
Why, are you hungry?

10:54.112 --> 10:56.035
I missed dinner.
Oh.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.120
What are you having?
A little pasta.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.536
Something like
rigatoni quattro formaggi?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.455
Good guess.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.337
Dinner's over, Bart.
Pay the tab at the bar.

11:10.670 --> 11:15.267
You just had the head of Narcotics arguing
with the DEA about what you're doing here.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.472
Why?
What do you mean?

11:16.634 --> 11:18.557
You're a drug-dealer and
don't pay taxes.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.063
I'm not active these days.

11:20.263 --> 11:24.063
But you're a legend around here, man.
Not only that, you're white.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.399
When they print your picture in the
paper, they'll be able to see it.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.610
So, what do you figure, Nick?

11:30.565 --> 11:32.112
I made lieutenant.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.995
It'll be announced next week.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.828
I'm the head of Narcotics
for L.A. County.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.627
Gee, uh, congratulations.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.913
That's all you got to say?

11:45.079 --> 11:48.208
What about your law degree?
I thought you were trying to get--

11:48.374 --> 11:51.844
Stop worrying about my career. The
government swears you're doing business.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.640
I'm not, here or anywhere.
And you couldn't catch me if I was.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.345
Try the sand dabs.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.271
Try the sand dabs.
Okay.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.690
Here, look. Watch!

12:04.349 --> 12:05.601
That's terrific.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.736
You know, I just...

12:14.901 --> 12:16.824
...think something's going on.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.705
I don't stop being a detective
because there's no crime.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.459
What do you think's going on?
Something you don't want me to know.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.459
How are we treating you
this evening, Mr. McKussic?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.377
Uh, fine, thank you.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.011
Can I offer you anything more?
More?

12:34.170 --> 12:36.923
There are two fish you haven't
tried. They're excellent.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.559
Sure.
What are they?

12:41.219 --> 12:43.096
I thought I'd surprise you.

12:44.889 --> 12:49.144
Uh, this is my friend,
Nick Frescia.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.022
A pleasure, Jo Ann Vallenari.
Can I bring you a plate?

12:52.730 --> 12:54.403
Thanks,
I've got to be going.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.656
Try us another night.
What I tried tonight was terrific.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.117
I'm pleased to hear it.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.513
She's attractive.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.179
Huh? Oh, yeah.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.602
So, how about it?

13:29.225 --> 13:31.023
How about what?

13:31.853 --> 13:33.776
Whatever you're doing...

13:34.063 --> 13:36.236
...do it somewhere else.
Don't make me look bad.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.743
There is one last thing.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.655
There's no new business.
It's, uh, an accounting problem.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.448
Accounting?
The Colombians.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.662
Always some discrepancy
about money.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.702
Sure. They don't
know how to count.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.084
I got your word, Mac?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.378
Yeah.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.339
One more thing.
Jesus.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.721
How about another bite of that
fucking fish, man? It's great.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.053
I give him two drinks.
That's two too many.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.849
If my brother sees Nino like this--
What's he gonna do, fire him?

14:09.015 --> 14:11.109
No, he's not going to
fire the chef, Arturo.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.861
But one bartender less
is not the end of the world.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.864
I don't want him driving that car.
He can have mine.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.242
Your Cadillac?
You want to kill him?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.698
I'll drive. I could dance.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.204
No, no.
Yes.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.956
No, you're going home.
Why?

14:33.581 --> 14:35.583
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

14:36.000 --> 14:38.173
<i>How did you know it was my birthday?</i>

14:38.336 --> 14:40.634
<i>Oh, uh, Arturo told me.</i>

14:43.591 --> 14:45.685
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:51.140 --> 14:52.266
Well?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.524
Well, uh...

14:55.686 --> 14:57.563
In the course of last night...

14:57.730 --> 15:00.324
...something came up
which persuaded me...

15:00.483 --> 15:04.113
...that Mac dining in that restaurant
is a non-drug related activity.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.326
Yeah.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.627
Your friend's not gonna get away
with what he's gotten away with...

15:10.785 --> 15:13.004
...for 15 years and just retire.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.923
What do you suggest?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.050
I suggest you make sure
we have a case.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.055
After all, what are friends for?

15:24.632 --> 15:27.055
<i>We haven't seen you in a while.</i>

15:27.218 --> 15:31.439
<i>I've been a little busy lately.
And I took a break, you know?</i>

15:31.597 --> 15:33.520
<i>Did you go away
for Thanksgiving?</i>

15:33.683 --> 15:36.857
<i>Yeah, I went up to
Aspen and put the skids on.</i>

15:37.019 --> 15:40.819
<i>Put skids on?</i>
<i>Yeah, I went skiing-</i>

15:42.400 --> 15:44.619
<i>Are you good?
No.</i>

15:44.777 --> 15:46.654
<i>Well, passing.</i>

15:47.822 --> 15:50.325
<i>I'm not an expert.
Are you?</i>

15:50.491 --> 15:51.663
<i>No.</i>

15:52.618 --> 15:54.586
<i>You should
go sometime. It's fun.</i>

15:54.745 --> 15:56.497
<i>Maybe I will.</i>

15:59.083 --> 16:01.586
Goddamn it, that the fuck
is the matter with you?

16:01.752 --> 16:04.096
I don't need you
flying in from Washington...

16:04.297 --> 16:08.177
...taking over my office,
telling me to manufacture evidence.

16:08.718 --> 16:13.144
This is my backyard, Hal! I don't grow
weeds in my backyard so I can pull them.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.490
Mac.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.410
Mac.

16:34.327 --> 16:38.548
I swear to God I wasn't trying to use you.
I was just trying to pay some bills.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.046
Well now you got another one to pay.

16:41.584 --> 16:44.212
Man, if I don't come through,
these guys'll kill me.

16:44.378 --> 16:48.053
Ha, no, they won't kill you. They'll
probably just break your legs.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.889
Here comes the
money junkie.

16:50.092 --> 16:54.643
I've been calling and calling.
And I just broke a fucking nail!

16:54.847 --> 16:57.100
I sent your
lawyer the check, Shaleen.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.110
Tomorrow's the first.
You might as well write another one.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.862
Shaleen, uh...

17:02.897 --> 17:05.820
I'm at a critical point in
this business that requires cash.

17:05.983 --> 17:10.113
So do I. Sorry, I'm not starving
so you can tell your little boy...

17:10.279 --> 17:13.031
...you're a rubber hose salesman
instead of a drug dealer.

17:13.741 --> 17:17.086
Cody gets old enough to ask
what his father does for a living...

17:17.244 --> 17:18.917
...he suddenly develops a conscience.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.128
Greg, I'll deal
with that other stuff later.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.964
Leave my kid out of this.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.298
Our kid.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.427
Anyway, I need another 10,000.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.271
The Mercedes burned up.
The SLC?

17:35.471 --> 17:38.190
It's under warranty.
Take it back, make them fix it.

17:38.432 --> 17:43.154
You know those assholes. They claim I
didn't have any oil in the engine.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.544
I made an improper suggestion.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.960
I overreacted. It was uncalled for.
No, no.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.424
No. It was my fault.
Well...

18:08.004 --> 18:09.221
Okay.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.718
Ha-ha-ha.
Look, I wanna lay my cards on the table.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.763
Whatever questions you have
about our operation...

18:17.471 --> 18:18.768
...go ahead, ask me. Shoot.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.935
Okay. Who's your snitch?
I can't tell you that.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.656
Ahem. We got to start
somewhere, Hal.

18:29.817 --> 18:34.072
How about, uh, July 17, 1963?

18:35.031 --> 18:36.954
"Frescia and McKussic
were arrested...

18:37.116 --> 18:39.369
...for curfew violation
on Hermosa Beach."

18:39.535 --> 18:41.333
Seven years later you
were with Mac...

18:41.495 --> 18:43.873
...when he was arrested for drugs
on Rosarito Beach.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.384
No, he was on the beach.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.716
I was in the water. Otherwise I'd
have been smoking a joint with him.

18:49.879 --> 18:53.725
Ended up in the same Mexican jail
for 2 years. What can I say?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.556
Hal, you have really
done your homework.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.063
Nick, this is not about
you being a cop.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.228
I know you're one
of the best.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.814
You're close to Mac.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.900
Mac is close to Carlos.
And he is coming to town.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.360
Who says?

19:08.522 --> 19:12.026
He's getting ready to move
1200 kilos of coke...

19:12.443 --> 19:13.740
...personally.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.740
That's the word.

19:18.783 --> 19:23.163
For $1100 a week a local snitch is liable
to tell you anything you want to hear.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.299
I'm also hearing it
from the Federal Mexican Police...

19:26.457 --> 19:28.676
...and believe me,
I'm not paying them.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.842
Like you say,
this is your back yard.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.470
Has Carlos ever made a move in it
without Mac's help?

19:36.384 --> 19:39.388
No. If Carlos is back in town,
Mac's back in business.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.433
So, what do you want from me?
Use your relationship with Mac...

19:43.599 --> 19:45.272
...to get to Carlos.
How?

19:45.434 --> 19:47.186
Any way you can.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.490
If Mac is clean,
it's gonna do him a lot of damage.

19:52.566 --> 19:56.321
Say he is working with Carlos
and we bust him.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.954
I will personally
guarantee that Mac...

20:01.117 --> 20:03.415
...does not have to stand trial
in federal court.

20:04.787 --> 20:07.882
You're liable to save him
15 years of his life.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.308
I've cleared out of
your office, Nick.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.905
It's me, Mac.
<i>Hey, my buddy.</i>

20:32.356 --> 20:33.983
No, you called me, buddy.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.035
Hey, not now, man.
They're watching me everywhere 1 go.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.832
Chrissake.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.628
I'm telling you, man,
there's renewed interest in me here.

20:49.790 --> 20:53.420
My cousin used my name
as a guarantee of delivery.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.943
It's not my cousin
I'm not worried about. It's you.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.521
Don't come here now.
Not now.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.857
Your chef's visa has expired.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.612
He does have a work permit.

21:53.771 --> 21:56.445
My brother's hired a lawyer
working through Immigration...

21:56.607 --> 21:58.234
...to get Nino his green card.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.868
You mean Andy Leonard?

22:00.778 --> 22:01.825
Yes.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.911
Have you ever seen Andy Leonard
in your restaurant...

22:05.074 --> 22:06.496
...with a Mr. Dale McKussic?

22:07.868 --> 22:11.122
Yes, they're both
very good customers.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.382
What's that?
What's what?

22:13.541 --> 22:15.418
A "good customer."

22:16.293 --> 22:18.546
Someone who is on time.

22:18.712 --> 22:23.058
And doesn't make personal requests
or demands for unusual dishes.

22:23.217 --> 22:25.265
In other words, you're telling us...

22:25.427 --> 22:29.648
...you've never had to satisfy any
personal requests from Mr. McKussic.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.689
No, Mr. Maguire,
he usually orders off the menu.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.695
Who are you and what's this about?

22:35.229 --> 22:37.106
Agent Maguire.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.237
Federal Drug Enforcement.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.820
Has Andy Leonard been arrested
on some sort of drug charge?

22:42.987 --> 22:44.034
We arrested him.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.494
What makes you think
my restaurant's involved?

22:46.657 --> 22:48.830
For one thing,
Leonard's in there all the time.

22:48.993 --> 22:52.167
So is the District Attorney.
Does that mean he's selling drugs?

22:52.329 --> 22:56.584
Mr. Leonard doesn't have dinner
with the DA He has it with McKussic.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.424
Mr. McKussic
is selling drugs in my restaurant?

22:59.587 --> 23:01.134
Maybe.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.053
Well, all I do is see him eat.

23:11.223 --> 23:16.150
Miss Vallenari, we know
how important your chef is to you.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.491
We have our problems.
We certainly...

23:21.692 --> 23:23.865
...don't have to help
Immigration with theirs.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.791
In other words,
if I'll spy on my customers...

23:28.949 --> 23:31.793
...you'll make sure my chef
isn't deported for drunk driving?

23:31.952 --> 23:33.829
I didn't say that, Miss Vallenari.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.248
Don't bother to explain.

23:35.414 --> 23:40.011
At 8:00, I'll be seating my lawyer
and his ex-partner, a federal judge.

23:40.169 --> 23:43.548
I'm sure they'll understand what
you meant and explain it to me.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.137
Okay, Hal.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.054
Hello, I'm Lieutenant Frescia
from the Sheriff's Department.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.145
We've met,
with Mr. McKussic.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.358
Absolutely.
And when you sue him...

23:55.559 --> 23:58.654
...I don't want to be anywhere
in sight. Get me out of here.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.576
Doesn't matter.
We'll have Arturo come--

24:12.785 --> 24:14.833
Take care of it.
Everything okay?

24:14.995 --> 24:17.714
It's nothing. Somebody
dropped last night's evidence...

24:17.873 --> 24:20.672
...including Nina's urine specimen.
What's that mean?

24:20.834 --> 24:23.633
It means we'll have to drop the case.
No court?

24:25.631 --> 24:27.633
No court.
No court!

24:28.509 --> 24:32.514
Hey. Hey! Take it easy, for chrissake!
I work here.

24:34.390 --> 24:35.687
What's on your mind?

24:36.517 --> 24:40.112
The way I met you with Mr. McKussic.
You seemed like friends.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.114
Yeah. Well...

24:42.272 --> 24:45.446
I'm sorry.
It's really none of my business.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.201
You've been terrific.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.744
Oh, don't worry about it. Just...

24:51.907 --> 24:53.955
...buy me dinner one of these days.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.911
Any goddamn day you want, Nick.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.919
Heh. Thank you so much.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.175
Bye-bye.

25:11.010 --> 25:14.139
We got the word your friend
McKussic has got a deal cooking.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.853
Yeah?
We're gonna nail him.

25:17.016 --> 25:20.566
If anybody can do it, Hal, you can.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.276
Why'd you let her chef go?

25:24.732 --> 25:26.985
She's tough, isn't she?
Ha, ha.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.745
She beat the shit out of you, Hal.
The hell she did.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.871
Ha, ha. The hell she didn't.
Ask anybody.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.287
Frescia,
what you got going on here?

26:05.814 --> 26:07.816
Shit.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.700
Mac! Hi.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.411
Where've you been?
I've been looking for you.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.581
In Chula Vista,
trying to sell farm equipment.

26:23.874 --> 26:26.172
So, what are the
Sin Sisters doing here?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.261
They're just
cranking on the coke.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.308
Mac, I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.
They're just leaving.

26:32.466 --> 26:36.016
What can I do for you?
I'll do anything.

26:36.678 --> 26:37.804
Name it.

26:38.430 --> 26:43.357
You can start by cleaning off that table
there, and get some new paddles and balls.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.066
Suddenly up for some Ping-pong?

26:45.229 --> 26:48.950
And I want you to drop something off
at Vallenari's for me.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.951
Who for?
Jo Ann Vallenari.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.034
Aren't you going there tonight?
I want to clean up first.

26:54.196 --> 26:57.291
Besides, it'll give her a chance
to look that over before we talk.

26:57.449 --> 27:01.625
And Greg, could you give it a rest?
Whatever, man. I hear you.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.381
What is it?

27:08.836 --> 27:11.555
The cop. He's waiting for you.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.641
How nice.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.516
It's not nice, he's a cop who
thinks he did you a favor.

27:17.678 --> 27:19.271
And cops are the worst barflies.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.682
It's not worth it,
I'm telling you.

27:21.849 --> 27:24.147
You just don't like
his looks, Arturo.

27:29.231 --> 27:32.208
It's quite an experience
watching you work.

27:32.234 --> 27:32.977
Oh?

27:33.110 --> 27:35.283
Like you're in a play,
everything's on cue.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.532
You are kind of letter-perfect.
Ha, ha. Thank you.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.503
Tell me, do you ever flub your lines?
Ha.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.585
Is that a polite way of suggesting
I lack spontaneity?

27:48.208 --> 27:49.300
Have you seen Mac?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.133
M r. McKussic.
Oh.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.424
He's going to ask you
to cater a party.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.969
That is our business.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.439
We think it involves his business.

28:03.599 --> 28:08.571
What are you suggesting? That I refuse
because it's a party for drug dealers?

28:08.729 --> 28:14.407
No. It's just that it's for this one
particular guy, he's particularly unpleasant.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.162
You mean violent?
No, I doubt that.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.119
Unless he doesn't like your lasagne.

28:20.282 --> 28:23.286
I'm sure Mr. McKussic's friend
will be very well-behaved.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.421
Why would you call him a friend?

28:26.622 --> 28:29.546
Just a figure of speech.
Who else would you give a party for?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.130
A business associate.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.471
As it happens,
Carlos and Mac are friends.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.803
And you and Mac are friends.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.683
That's right.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.812
Sounds like a pretty friendly
situation all around.

28:42.012 --> 28:43.264
Oh, no, not exactly.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.894
Nobody knows Carlos.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.651
Nobody even knows what Carlos
looks like but Mac.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.937
And you want to know
what Carlos looks like...

28:50.103 --> 28:52.447
...and you're asking me to spy
so you can find out?

28:52.606 --> 28:53.823
Absolutely not!

28:54.024 --> 28:57.995
<i>Look, let's not discuss my business
or his business or your business, okay?</i>

28:58.946 --> 29:01.165
But that leaves us
nothing to talk about.

29:01.657 --> 29:02.829
Let's eat.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.054
Good evening.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.724
<i>She's having dinner with him.</i>

29:19.883 --> 29:21.180
She can't be.

29:23.345 --> 29:27.851
The chef is with them right now
checking out their Caesar salads.

29:31.979 --> 29:33.981
What do you want me to do
with the envelope?

29:34.147 --> 29:35.899
You want me to drop it off anyway?

29:36.066 --> 29:38.694
Yeah, I'm beat.
I'll never make it in there.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.909
Um, thanks.

29:50.664 --> 29:54.419
You meet at Orville and Wilbur's
maybe once every Christmas, right?

29:54.584 --> 29:56.586
He throws his Chevrolet keys
on the bar.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.972
You throw your Porsche keys
on the bar.

30:00.590 --> 30:03.469
You pick up your drink,
you got a gold Rolex on your wrist.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.512
He's wearing a Timex.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.857
Even if he wasn't a cop,
he'd have to hate your guts.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.901
<i>Deputies
seized over 700 kilos of cocaine...</i>

30:12.060 --> 30:14.313
<i>...with an estimated street value
of $27 million.</i>

30:14.479 --> 30:16.777
Street value, $27 million.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.533
On what street is that?

30:18.692 --> 30:21.571
You show me how to get there
just once.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.582
Man, aren't you listening to me?

30:26.950 --> 30:31.251
Nick Frescia came in to that restaurant
looking for a way to bust your buns.

30:31.413 --> 30:35.088
Well he's gonna have to drag me
out of bed to do it. I'm...

30:35.250 --> 30:37.673
...under the weather. Heavily.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.594
Hey, Mac.
Yeah?

30:41.757 --> 30:44.476
What I'm telling you
is for your own good, man.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.897
That swordfish was great.
Mm. Excellent piece.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.232
And the Cristal.
You know it.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.063
We serve it at the
Lomita station.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.902
What do cops drink?

30:58.106 --> 31:01.610
Ah, hell, depends. I recommend
my men stay away from vodka.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.654
And stick to Scotch and bourbon.
Why?

31:03.820 --> 31:06.869
So the brass will know
they're drunk, not stupid.

31:07.908 --> 31:10.878
You have an answer for everything.
So do you.

31:11.953 --> 31:15.833
Every question Maguire asked, you answered
like you were reading off a menu.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.876
Your keys, Jovana.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.512
Thank you, Arturo.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.172
And yours.

31:26.176 --> 31:27.223
Want me to lock up?

31:27.386 --> 31:30.435
No, I'll lock up. Make sure
the kitchen is closed.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.690
Good night, Arturo.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.870
You were saying.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.907
You're still suspicious
of me and Mr. McKussic.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.701
Yeah.
You actually think...

31:50.867 --> 31:53.040
...we're in business together.
No.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.002
Oh.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.919
I--I don't date the customers,
Nick.

32:01.086 --> 32:05.432
Especially when they drive
$50,000 cars and always pay in cash.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.892
Then you'd heard about Mac.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.516
Sooner or later, you hear everything
in a restaurant.

32:10.679 --> 32:14.024
And he's never asked you out?
No.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.402
You're still suspicious.

32:17.602 --> 32:21.106
If I was, what difference would it make?
You'd talk me out of it.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.359
That's not it.
No?

32:24.526 --> 32:28.497
No, you're just suspicious of any
woman who hasn't slept with you.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.367
Jo Ann...
Heh.

32:31.533 --> 32:34.161
...that is a wildly off-the-wall
assumption on your part.

32:34.327 --> 32:37.251
What is it, Nick? You need
some Chap Stick or lip gloss?

32:37.414 --> 32:41.669
Your lips keep getting stuck on your
teeth, or is that your idea of a smile?

32:45.046 --> 32:47.174
That's my idea of a smile.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.932
Oh, man, you are.
You're tough.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.015
You're a bad boy, Nick.

32:57.601 --> 32:59.444
You're a very bad boy.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.531
What's this mean?

33:05.525 --> 33:07.448
Redondo Union High.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.330
You smoked in high school?

33:10.489 --> 33:13.038
Oh, yeah. We were a bunch
of rowdies, Jo Ann.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.870
How about an espresso?
What?

33:17.037 --> 33:20.462
I've got to lock up
and I'll never do it like this.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.806
Oh, no!

33:37.599 --> 33:39.272
Jo Ann, what are you doing?

33:39.434 --> 33:40.686
I--

33:40.852 --> 33:43.275
I want this under there.
Here, let me--

33:43.438 --> 33:46.408
No, no, you'll get dirty.
Don't be silly.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.952
Ugh. That skylight's indented
for some reason, so rain...

33:50.111 --> 33:54.992
...fills it up into a puddle
until it becomes a pond, and then...

33:55.158 --> 33:56.375
And then what?

33:57.786 --> 34:00.414
And then you're all wet.

34:00.872 --> 34:06.345
I'm sorry. Oh, Nick, I'm sorry.
I really should have just left it.

34:24.396 --> 34:28.071
<i>I don't know what it is...</i>

34:28.233 --> 34:31.112
<i>...about going to high school
with someone...</i>

34:31.987 --> 34:36.163
<i>...that makes you feel you're
automatically friends for life.</i>

34:37.826 --> 34:39.293
<i>Who says?</i>

34:40.661 --> 34:44.667
<i>Who says friendship lasts forever?</i>

34:46.626 --> 34:49.094
<i>We'd all like it to, maybe...</i>

34:50.005 --> 34:55.387
<i>...but maybe it just wears out
like everything else.</i>

34:55.552 --> 34:56.974
<i>Like tires.</i>

34:57.178 --> 34:59.397
<i>There's just so much
mileage in them...</i>

34:59.556 --> 35:02.150
<i>...and then you're riding around
on nothing but air.</i>

35:06.479 --> 35:08.152
Okay, keep your shirt on.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.703
Any word on, uh, where
McKussic's giving the party?

35:20.910 --> 35:25.086
How would I know? I'm waiting to hear
it from your snitch, whoever that is.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.001
I don't know, I keep coming back to this.
What do you think?

35:30.253 --> 35:32.847
Frescia. Hi.

35:34.090 --> 35:37.390
Uh, excuse me, Hal.
This is a personal call.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.643
How about a movie?

35:44.809 --> 35:47.232
<i>I can't tonight. We're booked solid.</i>

35:47.395 --> 35:48.738
This afternoon.

35:49.022 --> 35:52.151
<i>Don't you ever work?</i>
Yeah, I'm working now.

35:52.317 --> 35:56.697
Don't say that or I'll believe you.
I always believe the worst.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.451
I'm gonna die if I don't see you.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.912
Well, we can't have that. Um...

36:04.079 --> 36:06.298
Check out the competition with me
this week...

36:06.456 --> 36:07.958
...and we can both keep working.

36:20.345 --> 36:24.225
Where's Jo Ann?
She's taking a few days off.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.862
Mr. McKussic?
Your table is ready.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.773
I'll have the drink sent over.
Thank you.

36:56.798 --> 36:58.425
Where the fuck have you been?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.427
Working my ass off, Hal.

37:01.136 --> 37:04.015
Mac's party is a week from tomorrow
at his house...

37:04.180 --> 37:06.353
...at 1:00 in the
afternoon for 56 guests.

37:06.516 --> 37:07.768
You like cappuccino?

37:13.440 --> 37:16.159
<i>We got two, uh, coming out.</i>

37:16.317 --> 37:18.160
<i>Down front, two males.</i>

37:18.611 --> 37:20.659
I got them.

37:20.822 --> 37:24.042
<i>She won't talk
as long as the checks keep coming.</i>

37:25.160 --> 37:27.003
Surprise!

37:58.860 --> 38:00.328
What would you like?

38:02.655 --> 38:06.159
What's with the hotdog?
Doesn't anybody like hotdogs anymore?

38:09.829 --> 38:11.046
That's a good one.

38:34.813 --> 38:39.319
And I place mystery dust over it,
and it becomes an egg.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.361
You know how I do it?

38:50.578 --> 38:53.252
Ha, ha.
What's so funny?

38:53.414 --> 38:55.291
That dogcatcher.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.633
He's not catching the dog.
Yeah, that's right.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.889
Wrong size handcuffs.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.643
I'm leaving right now.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.608
Bye.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.773
Uh, thank you. Nice food.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.614
Thank you. Nice party.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.959
You're a real magician.
I was surprised.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.961
Well, it was a surprise party.
Ha, ha.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.539
Did it surprise your boy?
Oh, yes.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.255
Not as much as it surprised
the 25 cops on the beach...

39:37.417 --> 39:39.169
...but it did, yeah.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.555
You're gonna tell me
that's a surprise?

39:43.965 --> 39:45.012
No.

39:46.759 --> 39:51.060
Mr. Frescia said there was a possibility
the police would be watching you.

39:53.474 --> 39:54.976
Did he say why?

39:57.645 --> 39:58.942
Yes.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.441
Do you want me to be specific?

40:02.150 --> 40:03.743
I'd appreciate that.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.955
He said you were
a serious drug dealer.

40:12.118 --> 40:15.793
And that you promised to quit, but
that you lied and are still doing it.

40:17.165 --> 40:19.509
He called me a drug
dealer and a liar?

40:19.709 --> 40:22.588
What a bummer.
I guess I can't blame you.

40:22.754 --> 40:23.880
Blame me for what?

40:24.047 --> 40:27.176
Telling Nick about the party.
Thanks again.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.190
I didn't tell Nick about the party.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.272
He told me.

40:43.232 --> 40:45.234
What was I supposed to do?

40:46.027 --> 40:48.530
I didn't know it was
for your child's birthday.

40:48.696 --> 40:52.121
You didn't order the cake from us.
I didn't even know you had a child.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.377
I thought it was for someone
called "Carlos."

40:59.999 --> 41:02.878
Just pretend like
none of this ever happened.

41:07.548 --> 41:08.720
Yeah, thanks.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.601
We got the harbor patrol involved?

41:14.430 --> 41:16.273
They do surveillance in the marina.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.230
There's boats in the marina.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.732
You see, this is a house.

41:21.062 --> 41:24.487
A house is not gonna float away.
It's not gonna fucking move!

41:28.403 --> 41:29.871
Frescia.

41:30.530 --> 41:32.077
Yeah, put him through.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.830
Hey! How you doing?

41:36.285 --> 41:39.710
In my office. How about you?
In my office.

41:39.872 --> 41:42.591
I was wondering, Nick,
if we could get together somewhere.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.878
Well, yes, any particular time?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.679
Well how about right now?
Yeah. Sure, why not?

41:50.842 --> 41:53.220
When you say the man
is giving a party in a week.

41:53.386 --> 41:54.729
Hang on.

41:54.887 --> 41:58.187
And Carlos is coming to town in a week--
Who's your snitch, Hal?

41:58.599 --> 42:01.352
Huh? He hasn't gotten
a goddamn thing right.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.988
You look for Mac in L.A.,
he's in San Francisco.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.650
You go for Carlos,
you get Mac's kid.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.193
Sin Sisters?

42:08.359 --> 42:10.737
Listen, I'm not authorizing
any more county funds--

42:10.903 --> 42:12.621
Hey. Shit.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.829
Unless you get someone
who can actually identify Carlos.

42:15.992 --> 42:19.667
What the fuck are you talking about?
I don't know any-- Is he right there?

42:19.829 --> 42:21.422
Just about.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.090
Everything all right?

42:31.215 --> 42:34.936
How come you tried to get me
kicked out of my favorite restaurant?

42:35.762 --> 42:37.935
You told Jo Ann about
me, didn't you?

42:43.061 --> 42:44.483
Yeah, I did.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.400
You got a reason?

42:51.194 --> 42:54.448
I didn't want her getting
into something that might hurt her.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.867
Is that why you
told her about Carlos?

42:58.034 --> 43:00.036
So that she could identify him?

43:00.203 --> 43:03.298
Is that your way of making sure
that she doesn't get hurt?

43:06.125 --> 43:08.127
Okay, I fucked up.

43:11.631 --> 43:13.383
Look, Mac...

43:13.633 --> 43:18.355
...I've been seeing a lot of Jo Ann and
obviously it affected my judgment here.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.813
Nick...

43:27.855 --> 43:30.574
...if you want to go after Carlos,
go after him.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.073
Just don't use me to do it, okay?

43:37.782 --> 43:41.127
I don't get it, Mac.
I mean, what?

43:41.744 --> 43:43.712
Guy saves your life
in a Mexican prison...

43:43.871 --> 43:46.750
...so you owe him for the
next 20 years, is that it?

43:46.916 --> 43:48.509
Huh?

43:49.585 --> 43:51.883
None of my business.
Exactly.

43:56.926 --> 44:01.147
Oh, by the way, you, uh, told Jo
Ann about the party, didn't you?

44:01.305 --> 44:04.434
No, Mac.
You got it backwards.

44:05.184 --> 44:06.686
She told me.

44:07.603 --> 44:10.607
Oh, well, then I guess
she got it backwards, huh?

44:11.107 --> 44:12.984
Well, that's understandable.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.620
You confronting her like that,
she probably got flustered.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.198
After all...

44:18.781 --> 44:20.783
...she's not used to
that sort of thing.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.915
She's a very traditional girl.

44:26.831 --> 44:30.836
By the way, wish Cody
a happy birthday for me, will you?

44:31.544 --> 44:32.716
Sure.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.845
Jovana!

44:41.012 --> 44:42.810
Could you hold a moment?

44:49.645 --> 44:51.113
Yes?

44:51.272 --> 44:54.071
What do you want me to do
with Mr. McCussky's tip?

44:54.233 --> 44:58.158
McKussic. What you normally do, divide it
among everyone who worked the party.

44:58.321 --> 45:00.949
It was a pretty good tip.
What are you talking about?

45:01.115 --> 45:03.038
Well, his bill is $2500..
Yes.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.750
...and his tip is $2500.

45:09.248 --> 45:11.842
There's $5000 in there?

45:12.501 --> 45:14.754
Must have
been a pretty good party.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.219
Arturo, give me that envelope.

46:11.894 --> 46:15.489
If you're looking for Mac,
he's down at the competition.

46:16.983 --> 46:18.530
Thanks.

46:26.993 --> 46:28.290
Cody!

46:28.911 --> 46:30.254
Get...

46:30.413 --> 46:32.006
...away from the pier!

46:35.167 --> 46:37.420
Holy smoke, it's you!
Yes, it is.

46:37.586 --> 46:40.760
Look, Mr. McKussic, I don't want
your money. I don't want any of it.

46:40.923 --> 46:44.097
Uh, how come?
What did you think you were paying for?

46:45.761 --> 46:48.765
What? I don't get it,
if it's not enough...

46:48.931 --> 46:51.980
No, it's not enough.
Did you think you could buy me?

46:52.893 --> 46:55.396
Buy you what?
There's $5000 in there!

46:55.563 --> 46:56.655
Lower your voice, okay?

46:56.814 --> 47:00.193
I don't want anybody to think there's
something going down. $5000?

47:00.359 --> 47:03.112
That's right.
I must have grabbed the hundreds.

47:03.279 --> 47:04.997
Uh, you owe me.

47:06.032 --> 47:08.660
What? This was a mistake?

47:09.660 --> 47:13.005
Wrong envelope.
Um, Shaleen must have the fifties.

47:13.789 --> 47:15.883
She'll be pissed. Uh--

47:17.585 --> 47:21.431
What did you think
I was trying to buy for $5000?

47:39.440 --> 47:43.195
Hey, man, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

47:43.361 --> 47:46.410
Could you get everybody out of here?
I'll get the gate.

47:50.659 --> 47:52.627
What do you see?
What do you see?

47:52.787 --> 47:54.255
A Kleenex.

47:54.413 --> 47:56.507
Blow your nose on that!

48:00.252 --> 48:01.674
Still hurt?

48:01.837 --> 48:05.137
I feel like shit.
Mom's gonna blame this on you.

48:06.509 --> 48:09.308
Cody, uh, watch your language.

48:09.470 --> 48:12.724
How about if I send over
some angel hair pasta?

48:12.890 --> 48:15.234
Would you like that?
Okay.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.487
Thank you.
Thank you.

48:18.187 --> 48:19.905
Be well, Cody.

48:27.822 --> 48:30.826
I don't know what I'd have done
if you hadn't come along.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.372
Greg had my car.

48:33.119 --> 48:36.123
God, I'm sorry about that,
I don't usually do things like that.

48:36.330 --> 48:39.174
How can somebody make you sign forms
when your kid's neck--?

48:39.417 --> 48:41.260
Why don't you sit down?

48:41.502 --> 48:43.846
I'll just have some Herradura.

48:50.094 --> 48:51.767
Your boy lives with you?

48:54.140 --> 48:55.437
That depends.
On what?

48:55.641 --> 48:57.314
Money and his mama's mood.

48:57.518 --> 49:00.146
Don't you think you've
had enough of that?

49:00.312 --> 49:04.033
You want to hear Cody if he wakes up
and needs something, don't you?

49:08.904 --> 49:12.124
You're not gonna answer me, are you?
I don't think you want me to.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.705
Yes, I do.

49:13.868 --> 49:16.371
Okey-dokey. Uh...

49:16.537 --> 49:20.132
I'll answer any question you
care to ask. How about that?

49:21.667 --> 49:22.964
Okay.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.220
Bet I know the first one.

49:29.758 --> 49:31.476
Oh, what's that?

49:31.677 --> 49:35.147
How can you feel about your boy
the way you do and sell drugs?

49:35.306 --> 49:38.150
Cocaine. It is cocaine, isn't it?
Well, it was.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.606
But not anymore?
No.

49:39.768 --> 49:42.738
You were out with Andy Leonard
the night he was arrested.

49:42.897 --> 49:46.572
Nick tell you that?
What, you weren't out with him?

49:47.193 --> 49:48.786
Yeah, I was outwith him. Yeah.

49:48.944 --> 49:52.744
And you weren't selling cocaine?
No, I wasn't.

49:53.365 --> 49:56.460
He was.
Then what were you doing?

49:56.619 --> 49:59.714
I was trying to teach
him how to sell it.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.501
You're serious?

50:03.751 --> 50:07.301
That's what it came to. That fellow,
he's smart enough to be a lawyer...

50:07.463 --> 50:09.431
...but he's way too
dumb to be a crook.

50:09.590 --> 50:13.060
You had to be getting something.
Yeah, he's my lawyer.

50:13.219 --> 50:15.267
Yes.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.687
He's your lawyer, too.

50:20.601 --> 50:26.028
Okay. So he's your lawyer and he's my
lawyer. What does that do for you?

50:26.190 --> 50:27.863
Look, um...

50:30.110 --> 50:34.160
I pretty much knew that you knew...

50:34.323 --> 50:38.794
...what I had done for a living.
I wanted him to let you know...

50:40.704 --> 50:44.049
...that I now had
a legitimate business. Uh...

50:44.750 --> 50:47.128
Naturally, I didn't want him busted
in the meantime.

50:47.294 --> 50:51.344
So you thought Andy Leonard
would give you respectability?

50:52.841 --> 50:54.058
Yes, ma'am.

50:54.218 --> 50:57.643
Well, what do you need it for?

51:00.140 --> 51:01.608
You.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.612
So, uh...

51:10.234 --> 51:13.613
So if I asked you out,
maybe you'd accept.

51:15.781 --> 51:17.783
You don't need a lawyer for that.

51:18.033 --> 51:22.209
Dating is not a criminal activity,
Mr. McKussic. I think your...

51:22.371 --> 51:24.749
...profession has clouded
your judgment here.

51:28.377 --> 51:31.347
I'm flattered and I...

51:32.923 --> 51:34.470
I believe you.

51:38.012 --> 51:39.389
It was awful dumb.

51:51.317 --> 51:52.910
I'm...

51:54.028 --> 51:55.496
I'm late as hell.

52:16.634 --> 52:18.636
Arturo, pour me a
glass of champagne.

52:20.304 --> 52:22.227
You're never gonna
believe what happened.

52:22.431 --> 52:26.231
If it's bad news, I generally believe it.
I went to return Mr. McKussic's money.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.612
You gave back my tip.
I don't believe it.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.318
Good evening, lieutenant.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.445
You're early.
You're late.

52:35.819 --> 52:38.242
Disappointed?
Yeah. What kept you?

52:38.447 --> 52:41.326
You don't want to know.
We're over here.

52:42.368 --> 52:45.463
Uh, no, we're not.

52:45.621 --> 52:48.545
Where do you suggest?
The wine cellar, where else?

52:48.707 --> 52:53.213
Come on. Nick, come on.
Stop kidding around. I mean it.

52:53.379 --> 52:56.053
I have customers all over the place.

52:57.257 --> 52:58.804
I'll scream.

52:58.967 --> 53:00.969
That would be quite
unnecessary, señorita.

53:01.136 --> 53:05.141
Jo Ann Vallenari, may I present Commandante
Xavier Escalante-Portero y Vega...

53:05.307 --> 53:07.150
...of the Mexican <i>Federales.</i>
Pleasure.

53:07.601 --> 53:09.729
Lt. Frescia seems to
have alarmed you.

53:09.895 --> 53:12.990
I surprised Miss Vallenari with a
private party in the wine cellar.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.238
Because I phoned ahead
and made reservations.

53:15.401 --> 53:18.575
She arrived late
and didn't realize we were here.

53:19.279 --> 53:24.581
You go to a good deal of trouble to explain
an inconsequential event, lieutenant.

53:25.577 --> 53:28.421
Hal. You remember
Jo Ann Vallenari.

53:29.581 --> 53:31.583
Yes, of course.
How are you?

53:31.750 --> 53:33.218
Nice to see you.

53:36.296 --> 53:38.674
You were going to
tell me about your day.

53:38.841 --> 53:40.639
Oh, with Mr. McKussic.

53:40.801 --> 53:44.681
You were with Mac? How come?
if this is a professional question...

53:44.847 --> 53:47.066
...I don't want to answer.
Purely personal.

53:47.224 --> 53:50.273
Jovana, please,
the judge is waiting for you.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.605
I'll be right back.

53:53.814 --> 53:55.612
Hi, honey, how are you?
Judge.

53:55.774 --> 53:58.243
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
Not at all.

54:02.906 --> 54:07.377
Here is a green card for Nino.
I had to pull some strings.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.478
Come on, Nick, Escalante's waiting.

54:29.224 --> 54:31.727
He wants to give you a
token of his friendship.

54:31.753 --> 54:33.987
What?
A gun.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.984
He's Mexican.
What can I tell you?

54:38.525 --> 54:42.075
You wanted someone to ID Carlos.
I've got him for you.

54:43.071 --> 54:45.244
I have worked with Escalante
for eight years.

54:45.407 --> 54:47.501
He does not get involved
in an operation...

54:47.701 --> 54:49.544
...unless he can bring it off.

54:49.703 --> 54:50.875
Don't mess with him.

54:51.914 --> 54:53.712
You can mess with her anytime.

54:56.752 --> 55:00.382
Think it was an accident
Nino was arrested for drunk driving?

55:00.547 --> 55:03.517
Frescia had the police
waiting for him every night.

55:03.675 --> 55:05.393
Why?
He figured you knew more...

55:05.552 --> 55:09.682
...about Mac than you did and he was going
to use Nino to find out what you knew.

55:10.432 --> 55:12.275
How did the judge get involved?

55:12.434 --> 55:16.029
He's the Federal judge Frescia
went to for the deportation order.

55:16.605 --> 55:20.326
I pointed out to the judge he was about
to deport his fettuccine verde...

55:20.484 --> 55:24.034
...his ossobuco
and his rigatoni quattro formaggi.

55:26.573 --> 55:29.452
Our informants assure us that
Carlos will contact McKussic...

55:29.618 --> 55:32.588
...before he goes elsewhere else
to conclude his business.

55:32.746 --> 55:35.215
Would he risk
going to McKussic's house?

55:35.374 --> 55:39.800
Well, he hardly expects me to be
there to identify him, Mr. Maguire.

55:40.003 --> 55:43.803
After all, beaches are a crowded,
friendly place, aren't they?

55:44.132 --> 55:47.978
People don't wear much
in the way of clothing.

55:48.220 --> 55:53.067
Guns and surveillance equipment
are that much more difficult to hide.

55:54.476 --> 55:57.525
Mr. McKussic
thinks about such things.

55:58.146 --> 56:00.399
Which brings me to the point.

56:00.566 --> 56:04.241
A group of Mexicans patrolling
the strand will look conspicuous.

56:04.403 --> 56:08.249
I suggest your people
patrol the beach...

56:08.448 --> 56:13.170
...and keep a wide perimeter with some
sort of frozen surveillance for us.

56:13.328 --> 56:14.580
Where do you wanna be?

56:14.746 --> 56:17.374
There's a lot on the highlands
above his home.

56:17.541 --> 56:21.341
But I'm told Mr. McKussic
has a boat stored on this lot.

56:21.545 --> 56:24.344
That could prove, uh,
awkward.

56:24.506 --> 56:26.474
That can be handled.

56:27.509 --> 56:29.102
How?

56:29.595 --> 56:31.393
With a phone call.

56:35.058 --> 56:37.231
Don't you have to
get back to your party?

56:37.394 --> 56:39.021
In a minute.

56:46.361 --> 56:47.408
Excuse me.

56:47.571 --> 56:49.665
Is there something wrong?

56:50.490 --> 56:52.913
You asking about McKussic,
what did you want to know?

56:53.076 --> 56:55.704
I was asking about you.
I wanted to know why you saw him.

56:55.871 --> 56:58.875
I thought he owed me an explanation.
Did you get it?

56:59.041 --> 57:01.885
Oh, yeah.
Would you like to hear it?

57:03.170 --> 57:05.013
I'm not sure.

57:05.672 --> 57:08.642
Mr. McKussic, it seems,
has been engaged in his business...

57:08.800 --> 57:10.473
...for purely
romantic reasons.

57:10.636 --> 57:14.766
While you, it seems, have been engaged
in romance for purely business reasons.

57:14.932 --> 57:17.105
I'm not sure I understand that.

57:17.267 --> 57:19.110
A little vague for you?

57:19.269 --> 57:20.361
A little.

57:20.520 --> 57:25.651
Then let me spell it out. You want to
fuck your friend? Fuck him, not me.

57:35.410 --> 57:37.879
How you doing?
I gotta go to work, okay?

57:38.038 --> 57:39.130
See you.

57:39.289 --> 57:41.007
Well, is everything okay?

57:41.166 --> 57:43.919
I'll end up irrigating
half the county before this is over.

57:44.086 --> 57:45.804
So who's gonna sit me?

57:45.963 --> 57:48.466
Uh, Ann Marie downstairs.
She's very good.

57:48.674 --> 57:50.017
You ever date her?

57:50.175 --> 57:51.893
Well, no.
I don't date the sitters.

57:52.052 --> 57:54.146
Why couldn't Jo Ann babysit me?
Who?

57:54.304 --> 57:56.102
Jo Ann Vallenari.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.522
How do you know
her name?

58:00.310 --> 58:02.779
Well, she promised to make me
angel hair spaghetti.

58:03.563 --> 58:07.864
Well, I wouldn't count on that now, Cody.
She's a very busy girl.

58:08.026 --> 58:09.619
Well, doesn't she
like you, Dad?

58:09.778 --> 58:13.499
Well, gee, we never really
got around to that. Uh...

58:14.199 --> 58:16.042
How come she doesn't
like you, Dad?

58:17.536 --> 58:19.129
I didn't say she
didn't like me.

58:19.287 --> 58:22.541
I don't know what she likes
or if she likes a goddamn thing.

58:22.708 --> 58:25.177
There's some people
who don't like much of anything.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.884
They just have nice manners
and live, you know?

58:28.046 --> 58:29.923
Cody, take your
shoes off the bed.

58:35.929 --> 58:37.181
What are you doing?

58:37.347 --> 58:39.770
I got a ticket.
Noise abatement ordinance.

58:40.017 --> 58:43.066
Not allowed to do any work
on machinery in the neighborhood.

58:43.228 --> 58:48.200
Haven't worked on this thing in a month.
Anyway, I better move it or they will.

58:50.527 --> 58:53.371
I ran into Rudi
Samudio's customers.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.658
They're desperate
for product.

58:55.824 --> 58:58.122
Not as desperate as Rudi.
He's doing 100 years.

58:58.827 --> 59:01.125
They'll go up to half
a million in advance.

59:01.288 --> 59:06.044
Greg, I couldn't help you if I wanted to,
and I don't want to.

59:06.209 --> 59:07.756
Okay. Okay.

59:09.046 --> 59:11.140
But you got to know
where something is...

59:11.298 --> 59:15.849
...even if it's bad shit.
I mean, Mac, half a million bucks!

59:21.266 --> 59:26.022
Greg, I thought we agreed you weren't gonna
hit me with this kind of stuff anymore.

59:26.188 --> 59:27.906
Why do you keep talking?

59:28.065 --> 59:31.319
I just had a feeling
you were gonna change your mind.

59:34.112 --> 59:35.955
Yeah.

59:36.948 --> 59:39.417
Look, Greg,
enough of this shit, huh?

59:42.079 --> 59:45.424
I got to stick this thing in the water.
See if it floats.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:11.817
What can I do for you, Jovana?
I'm okay.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.577
You don't have to be
here yet.

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:16.079
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Thanks.

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:18.491
Go home and rest
and come back tonight.

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:20.250
No, I'm fine.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:32.471
It's okay.

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.020
I didn't know you.

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:53.576
I didn't know your relationship with Mac.
I only knew he was hiding something.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.954
It turned out to be his feelings.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.033
But you're so smooth...

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:05.079
...I figured you were hiding
something too.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.872
How could you tell?

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.297
You lie to me about Mac.
You lie to Mac about me.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.595
You lie to the judge
about everybody.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:17.348
Sooner or later, you have to lose
sight of the facts, don't you?

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.724
No.

01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:22.434
No, you don't lose sight of the
facts, not unless you're nuts.

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:25.766
You just...

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:29.065
You lose sight of
your feelings.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.071
Mac knows how he feels.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.949
He's crazy about you
and doesn't want to get caught.

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:40.160
For a crook, it's crystal clear. On the
other hand, for a cop, it's confusing.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.328
Mac's my friend and I like him.

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.210
Maguire's my associate
and I hate him.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:52.343
I probably have to bust my friend
if I'm gonna do my job and I hate that.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.888
But I hate drug dealers and
somebody's got to get rid of Carlos.

01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.344
How do I do that?

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.179
With my powers of deduction,
I walk into your restaurant...

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:06.144
...take one look at
you and realize...

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:10.561
...no matter how good the food is,
Mac's not here to eat. He's in love.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:16.867
Then I have to wonder if you're not as
good about concealing your feelings...

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:21.030
...as you are at taking care of your customers.
I know you're not in the drug business.

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:24.325
But you've got guilty knowledge
that can help me do my job.

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.372
So I checked you out.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:36.720
You've had, as near as I can tell,
three affairs in the last seven years.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:41.471
One with a lifeguard who was more
a high school buddy than anything else.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.477
The other a painter who did
frescoes for your restaurant.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:48.558
And the third a married man where you broke
off the relationship almost immediately.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:52.523
So you're not exactly
wild and crazy in this area.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:57.323
I figured if you got involved with me,
you're probably not involved with Mac.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.279
But given his interest in you...

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:03.163
...you're as likely to find out what's
going on in his life as anybody.

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:07.167
What I didn't figure is
that you're not like me.

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:11.542
You're honest and kind
and principled.

01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:15.625
And I trust you.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.547
Suddenly, I'm...

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:24.805
...ashamed.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:33.519
You're the most beautiful thing I've
ever seen and I'm nuts about you.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.358
Now I've only got one question.
It's not about Mac.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:42.778
I don't want to know
what you know about Mac.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.908
Man, I just want to see you tonight.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:54.130
Will you?

01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.213
See me?

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.555
So, what else you
know about me, Nick?

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:22.701
God, didn't somebody
turn the machine on?

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:26.697
No, somebody didn't,
because I'm supposed to do it.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.623
Vallenari's, good morning.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:38.216
Uh, no, I do too know who it is.
How did you get my number?

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:44.598
I'm really surprised you'd be left alone
all morning without any supervision.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:47.009
I don't believe you.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:02.111
Okay. Well, I'll see
what I can do.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:14.210
Um, I'll be over as
soon as I can.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:16.542
Okay?

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:18.665
Okay.

01:05:19.207 --> 01:05:20.584
Bye.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.599
So, do you think there's a chance?
Of what?

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:39.018
Of seeing you tonight.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:42.230
Let's play it by ear.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:44.532
Call me later.

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.030
Okay.

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:06.258
<i>We're continuing...</i>

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:09.595
<i>...with the full-spectrum
rock and roll on KMPC-FM.</i>

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:11.634
<i>Beautiful Southern
California day.</i>

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.350
<i>I tell you, that song was made
for girl-watching.</i>

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:17.891
<i>Just, the fantasies come
just by hearing the lyrics.</i>

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:20.606
<i>Looks like the low
clouds and haze...</i>

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.373
<i>Female Caucasian, late 20s.</i>

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:43.291
<i>Fair hair, medium height.</i>

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.670
No makeup.
No visible jewelry.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.298
<i>What's she doing?</i>

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:55.182
Right now, she's taking
some cloths out of the car.

01:06:55.803 --> 01:06:58.022
Obviously, she's
going back to the house.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.518
<i>Earlier she was cooking spaghetti.</i>

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.812
Fancy dish, cooking spaghetti.

01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:10.284
<i>How about that call, Hal?</i>

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:14.289
<i>It's okay. our guy is set to drop
off the half million at McKussic's.</i>

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:17.038
<i>Carlos is gonna pick
it up there tonight.</i>

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.794
<i>What about McKussic?</i>

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:22.797
<i>Yeah, could
you hold on a second?</i>

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:25.709
Where you going?
Carlos is due at McKussic's.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.297
Not till 12:30.

01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:33.680
Jo Ann Vallenari is not an informant, Hal.
I don't want her mistaken for one.

01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:37.937
Forget it. She let herself in,
she can let herself out.

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:43.860
I just left half a million dollars with somebody
at the chapel. it was not for religious purposes.

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:45.565
I'm telling you, Nick...

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:49.991
...if you call her, you go anywhere
near Mac's, I'll have you shot.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:51.943
You hear me?

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:57.248
You mean arrested, don't you, Hal?

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:04.039
<i>I'm sorry, Xavier,
what were you saying?</i>

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:06.708
<i>What about McKussic?
Where's he going to be?</i>

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.877
<i>Well, we're not sure.</i>

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:10.886
<i>He hasn't been very cooperative.</i>

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:15.425
<i>But it's no problem. Our guy has
made contact with Carlos directly.</i>

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.613
How long have you been here?

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.283
How long have you been here?

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:15.861
Mind if we discuss
this somewhere else?

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:20.286
After I got through dealing with
the fact you left him alone...

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:24.586
...Cody admitted he dismissed
the babysitter to get me over here.

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:29.545
I didn't know when you were coming back,
so I called his mother to pick him up.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:32.130
How did he know where to reach you?

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.258
He called the restaurant.
Called the restaurant?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.095
Yes, he called the restaurant.
Care for a glass of wine?

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:40.975
It's not a bad Chardonnay.
Where'd he get the number?

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.143
Your bed stand.

01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:52.529
I'm late for work.

01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:55.446
When was you last time
you saw Nick Frescia?

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.402
This morning.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:02.745
I didn't realize you're
open for breakfast.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.911
When you gonna see him again?
I can't answer that.

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:10.753
That's right, you don't talk about customers.
Especially not after I've slept with them.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:13.759
If you want to know anything more
about Nick, talk to him.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:17.297
And he'll tell me to talk to you.
Thanks for the bullshit, Slick.

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:27.937
Did you call me "Slick"?
I'll say.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.272
Okay.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.646
Ask me anything.
Ask anything?

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:34.655
Whatever you want to know about me.

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:36.365
Okay.

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:39.702
Anything, Mr. McKussic.
Listen, mind not calling me Mr. McKussic?

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:43.365
I'll call you anything you want. Contrary
to what everyone seems to think...

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:46.535
...I'm not good at undercover work.
I don't know your first name.

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:51.628
It's Dale. But don't call me that either.
Then don't call me "Slick."

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:02.050
<i> Alpha, Beta, Charlie teams.</i>

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:06.187
<i>We meet at 1020 Western and P.C.H.
Equipment van is waiting.</i>

01:11:17.315 --> 01:11:19.659
It's called leaky-pipe irrigation.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.036
Trade name is Hydro-pore.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.280
Hm.
Made from old vulcanized tires.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:28.372
You stick it about 14 inches under the
soil and it kind of sweats out the water.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:32.755
I got an order last week for 50,000 feet
from a lemon grower in Encinitas.

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:36.418
I didn't think there were any
groves left in California.

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.628
You said she was leaving.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:41.260
She was.

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:43.345
Well, what's the delay?

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:46.227
<i>They're watering the lawn-</i>
Heh.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:49.894
Watering the lawn.

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.192
So, what do you think?

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.399
I think...

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:59.691
...you're a legitimate businessman.
Heh.

01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:02.861
Yeah, well, I hope so. If it
doesn't work, I'm a crook forever.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:06.076
Why haven't you gotten out of
that other before?

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:08.662
It's a lot tougher to
quit than you think.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.168
<i>Just say no.</i>

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:14.498
Nobody wants me to quit.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.918
You know?
Don't quit. Don't get caught.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.303
Stay on top long enough
for us to knock you off.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:23.510
That's the motto around here.
Nobody wants me to quit.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.345
Cops want to bust me.

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:27.727
The Colombians want my connections.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:29.307
My wife, she wants my money.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:33.058
<i>Her lawyer agrees. Mine likes
getting paid to argue with them.</i>

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.401
Nobody wants me to quit.

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:41.278
I haven't even mentioned my customers.
You know they don't want me to quit.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:46.162
That is completely paranoid.

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:48.865
Hey, I'm just talking here.

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:51.204
I'm not trying to convince you
of a damn thing.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:54.830
I may be paranoid, but then again...

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.794
...nobody wants me to quit.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:02.129
No, I-- I'm sorry.
I was just joking.

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.218
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:07.425
Oh, come on.
It didn't hurt that bad.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.769
Just looking at you
hurts more.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:34.989
I thought you said
she was leaving.

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:38.456
<i>Well, sir, it was a
miscommunication. I'm sorry.</i>

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:41.166
How much longer do
you think she'll be?

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:32.255
I can't leave just yet.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.765
My clothes are still in the dryer.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:37.472
Okay.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.333
Jesus, God.
Get out of there!

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:35.113
Look, I believe you that
you're out of that other business.

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:36.948
And--

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:40.698
What's that?

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.876
Oh, nothing.
It's just my service.

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:45.502
I better call.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.589
Right now?
Yeah.

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:50.966
I'll be right back.

01:18:27.494 --> 01:18:29.292
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:33.380
Are you nuts? They're covering me like a
blanket! Didn't I tell you to call first?

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:36.295
Oh, Jesus. Not only that,
you scared the shit out of me!

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:39.090
Get away, this is not funny.
I'm wearing a fucking towel.

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:42.100
You know who is in charge
of all that surveillance out there?

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:45.559
The U.S. Government and
the Federal Republic of Mexico...

01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:49.476
...have me watching you
waiting for me to show up.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:53.613
Which reminds me. I talk into the
wrong one of these, buddy...

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:55.990
...and it costs us
50 years apiece.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:58.697
Yeah?

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:10.538
I told you, buddy. I told you on
the phone. I take care of everything.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:14.834
<i>I've been instructed to
tell you that Carlos has entered the house.</i>

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.968
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:21.177
But you, Mac, I trust with my life.
You keep me waiting all night...

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:24.472
...without showing the slightest sign
of being worried about me.

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:27.184
Forget it. You had your hands full.
I could see that.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:31.943
What's more, you fuck like a world
champion. Four fucking hours!

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:35.904
Those cops out there are terrified
their wives are gonna hear about this.

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:39.818
I got starved just watching you.
She can cook too, this girl.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:45.536
Believe me, if she's willing to take out
the garbage, marry her. Trust me, buddy.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.426
You think this the
best idea right now?

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:09.104
When's the next time
we'll get a chance to play?

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.440
In jail.

01:20:11.598 --> 01:20:14.021
What's going on with you
and Lindroff?

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.607
I don't want my cousin
involved in anything.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:18.321
I realize...

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:23.069
Yeah?

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.030
I'll take care of it.

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:38.334
Hello?

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:40.052
Who?

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:43.051
You've got company.
Company?

01:20:45.132 --> 01:20:46.384
It's for you.

01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:05.740
You've got to be out of here in less
than 20 minutes, for chrissakes.

01:21:05.903 --> 01:21:08.076
We're never gonna finish the game!

01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:14.583
Vittorio's wife called.
He had to go home.

01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:17.877
I've got to go close up.

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:40.271
What are you doing?
There's nothing wrong with Vittorio's wife.

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:43.156
I had Arturo call you.
Jo Ann, listen to me.

01:21:44.525 --> 01:21:48.155
Mac is gonna get busted tonight.
There's an informant making sure of that.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.790
Because of what's been going on,
your behavior could be misconstrued.

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:52.569
Misconstrued?

01:21:52.595 --> 01:21:54.978
You are in the wrong
place at the wrong time!

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:59.293
That could get you hurt.
Give me your purse.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:07.883
I want you to, uh,
go inside and lock the door.

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:12.053
Detective Torres will be here
in a few minutes.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:15.389
He'll take care of you
until this is over.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:17.975
There.

01:22:18.142 --> 01:22:22.192
That's ready to fire.
All you really care about is arresting Mac.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.028
Get inside.

01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:01.936
Hey, don't smoke. I got some
kind of leak in the fuel line.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:07.988
Well, everything's set.
Not quite. Carlos is still at your house.

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:55.364
Wait a minute.
Now I recognize you.

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:58.663
From the restaurant with
Lieutenant Frescia.

01:23:58.825 --> 01:24:01.624
Jo Ann Vallenari.
Where is Mr. McKussic?

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:04.040
I recognize this, too.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.504
You gotta watch
out for her.

01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:09.967
Is that right?
Oh, yeah.

01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:13.181
She's friendly with a cop
that knows Mac.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:15.680
Where is Mac, by the way?

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:18.895
You think she could be dangerous?

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:23.059
Be some sort of informant?

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:27.529
I do.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.858
Mac's nuts about her.
He wouldn't see it.

01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:32.822
That's terrible.

01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:36.329
Have you mentioned this to him?

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:40.288
Oh, yeah!
I do what I can for Mac.

01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:41.747
Well.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.036
It's all here.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:45.293
Yes, it is.

01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:47.507
Speaking of information...

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:51.921
...you were busted by the Drug
Enforcement Agency four months ago.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:57.309
You didn't happen to mention that
to Mac, did you? No, I didn't think so.

01:24:58.051 --> 01:24:59.928
What a shame.

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:06.189
When you're in trouble, people need to talk
to somebody. if it's not their friends...

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:09.025
...it's usually your enemies.

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:14.827
Federal narcotics number 7-2-4-4.

01:25:20.532 --> 01:25:23.706
<i>Maguire claims he's the one
that has contact with Mac's cousin?</i>

01:25:23.869 --> 01:25:26.463
Yeah, why?
<i>At 7:00, we spotted a couple...</i>

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:30.547
<i>...of Escalante's men with Mac's cousin.</i>
Near the Wayfarer's chapel?

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:33.428
Right.
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:46.475
He's got some
interesting holes in him.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:48.770
He went down,
what can I tell you?

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:50.903
For only getting hit
once or twice...

01:25:51.063 --> 01:25:54.158
...he sure got him in the best spots,
wouldn't you say?

01:25:54.775 --> 01:25:57.369
All right, who fired their gun?

01:25:57.527 --> 01:26:02.124
Everybody to the edge of the pier.
Let's go, let's have a show of hands.

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:05.248
Come on, people, hands in the air!

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:11.500
How the fuck did this guy get dead?

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:16.468
Escalante's men got here ahead of us.
That's when there was gunfire.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:27.099
This stinks.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:30.398
It's gas fumes. So what?

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:33.818
<i>You know...</i>

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:38.364
...I've been hearing for months now
how Carlos was real upset because...

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:42.907
...he shipped cocaine on a tanker where it got
soaked in gasoline and he couldn't sell it.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:47.206
What is this?
Yeah.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:51.840
Twelve-hundred kilos exactly. I think you
just paid half a million for it, Hal.

01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:55.879
You're full of shit, Frescia. Carlos
wouldn't go to that trouble for half--

01:26:56.044 --> 01:27:00.140
Half a million dollars? Probably not, but
who knows what he's really up to, huh?

01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:02.972
I mean, your snitch
isn't gonna tell us.

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:12.644
Where's Escalante?

01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:15.197
I don't know.

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:18.658
He said something about
going back to his boat.

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:21.328
His boat?

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.455
He sailed up here from Ensenada.

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:28.828
Said he wanted to go fishing
for albacore on the way home.

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:32.335
Gone fishing?
Yeah.

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:34.629
What is wrong with that?

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:46.436
Escalante is Carlos,
you miserable shit.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:57.155
She works hard
at a fashionable restaurant...

01:27:57.314 --> 01:28:00.693
...but never takes the time
to enjoy a good meal.

01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:04.070
She starts taking the time.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:07.866
She enjoys it.

01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:11.248
She goes from one customer
to another...

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:15.583
...from your friend Nick Frescia
to his friend Dale McKussic to...

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:18.130
...who knows?

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:22.589
I'm sure the girl has
friends of her own.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:27.136
The point is she's discarded
her traditional values.

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:29.976
She's lost.

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:35.687
Then she uses cocaine,
for chrissake.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.196
Naturally, she dies.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:43.444
It's an American tragedy.

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:49.325
Don't worry, buddy,
I won't kill her unless you approve.

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.743
And if I don't approve?

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:54.333
Then we talk until you do.

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:07.593
Come on, when was the last time
we smoked some really good shit, huh?

01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:10.224
Come on.

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:14.187
Life is serious enough.

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:21.583
Where is she?

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:36.732
I should be the one calling you for
help. It's been rowdy down here tonight.

01:30:37.182 --> 01:30:39.480
What's up?
We've got to find a boat.

01:30:39.643 --> 01:30:44.570
Probably out of Ensenada. Put in
for mooring in the last five days.

01:30:44.731 --> 01:30:46.699
You want me to call
every harbor master...

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.906
...between here and Mexico?
Yeah.

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:52.869
<i>Torres
at Vallenari's. She's not here, Nick.</i>

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:57.335
Check McKussic's and get
back to me right away.

01:30:57.661 --> 01:31:00.130
Yeah, this is
Woody Trainer, Tyler 12.

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:04.338
Why would I do something like that?
What for? What would I gain?

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:06.629
Believe me, Jo Ann,
we've been sitting here...

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:10.174
...doing nothing but asking ourselves
that same question.

01:31:11.925 --> 01:31:17.147
I haven't seen any matador stand his ground
in front of the horns like that since Abruza.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.267
He's a pussy.

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:25.822
He's the finest matador in Mexico.

01:31:27.607 --> 01:31:29.280
He's a pussy, man.

01:31:30.777 --> 01:31:32.199
Heh.

01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:35.456
Why is that, buddy?

01:31:35.949 --> 01:31:38.327
I don't know why.
Look at him.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.334
I mean, look at the matador, man.
What does he fucking do?

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:43.123
He dresses up in his little...

01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:47.044
...spangles and puts on
his fucking sequined jacket...

01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:49.679
...and wraps that sash
around his waist.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:52.557
Then puts on his little
pink stockings...

01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:56.812
...and his hair up in a little pigtail.
I mean, that's a pussy.

01:31:58.221 --> 01:32:00.770
Agh. Whoa.

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:04.979
I mean, that's what a bullfight is.

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:09.532
It's saying he's a pussy.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:14.071
And we're the bull.

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:19.167
They got that thing
and they wave it like a red flag.

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:22.204
What do we do?
We charge that sucker!

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:24.168
And so they always
got the edge.

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:26.753
They know what we're gonna do.
We're predictable.

01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:29.669
They're just gonna
stick it in...

01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:32.715
...and break it off.
There's not a fucking thing to say.

01:32:32.881 --> 01:32:35.259
Bravo, buddy!

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:38.512
What are we gonna
do about it?

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:43.354
What are we gonna do about it? You die.
You fucking die. That's what you do.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:46.816
Wait, I've seen him this way.
He's very serious.

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:56.781
Are you coming with me
or are you gonna stick around here?

01:32:58.281 --> 01:33:01.626
This is a tragic fucking
mistake, buddy.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:06.506
She'll testify and she'll get us all.
She's the only one who can.

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:14.473
What are you gonna do about that?
What about your boy, family, friends?

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:17.176
What are you gonna do?
Get in the boat.

01:33:29.687 --> 01:33:32.315
I urge you to reconsider.

01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:36.703
Meet me at Pier 17. Stay up on
channel 12. I'll tell you when.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:02.603
Son of a bitch.

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:08.109
Could you go down below
and get me a flashlight?

01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:10.896
I think there's one near
the companionway. -Mac?

01:34:11.062 --> 01:34:14.657
Can you do that right now, please?
We haven't got all night here.

01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:40.053
How about that light?

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:45.726
Could you turn it on?

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:51.649
Here. Just, right--
Could you hold it, please?

01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:54.106
Right, just there.

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:56.525
That's an awful lot of money.

01:34:57.901 --> 01:35:00.074
Shit. Fifteen million dollars.

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.994
That's an awful lot of money.
Yeah, well.

01:35:03.156 --> 01:35:07.127
Money makes people predictable, at least.
They're never gonna be reliable.

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:11.923
There's nothing Nick doesn't know about me.
I didn't talk about you.

01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:14.129
Forget it.
I don't want to forget.

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:16.966
I don't care what you want.
Soon as I drop you off...

01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:19.426
...you better take a long vacation
to Bora Bora...

01:35:19.589 --> 01:35:21.762
...because you're never
gonna live to testify.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:24.678
I was never going to testify.
You're telling me.

01:35:24.844 --> 01:35:26.892
Mac, I'd die before
I'd hurt you.

01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:29.023
Well, that was being arranged.

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:32.152
If you believe what Carlos said,
why didn't you let him kill me?

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:34.654
Why did you do what you did?

01:35:38.233 --> 01:35:40.201
Could you hold the
light, please?

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.078
Could--?
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.118
Mac.
Ugh.

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:47.333
Mac, I love you.

01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:50.666
You got to stop talking,
you know?

01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:54.124
I got to fix this boat
or somebody will get killed.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:58.588
Let me put it to you like this. Shut up
or I'll smack you. Now hold the light.

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:02.890
I love you.
Agh! Damn it!

01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:14.401
Mac, I love you.

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:16.278
Don't say that again.

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.323
I love you.

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:29.334
I love you.

01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:43.052
I tell you right now, Nick...

01:36:44.257 --> 01:36:47.386
...if we find McKussic
anywhere near Escalante...

01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:49.891
...I'm gonna put him
away for 25 years.

01:36:50.054 --> 01:36:52.933
That's not what we agreed on.
You're reneging on a deal.

01:36:53.099 --> 01:36:57.354
You are a lying no-good cocksucker
and a four-flushing son of a bitch.

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.147
But, no matter.

01:36:59.314 --> 01:37:00.816
Hang on a sec.

01:37:01.774 --> 01:37:03.947
You didn't tell me Mac was involved.

01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:06.701
What difference does that make?
Mac's a friend.

01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:09.867
He's a drug smuggler.
What do you mean, Frescia?

01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:11.956
Let's see.

01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:17.461
You've lost half a million dollars,
confiscated a ton of useless coke...

01:37:17.707 --> 01:37:22.679
...and been responsible for the murder of a
federal informant, and that's just tonight.

01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:24.802
That's all bullshit, and you know it.

01:37:26.174 --> 01:37:27.972
Well have you thought about this?

01:37:28.801 --> 01:37:30.974
Mac can identify
Escalante as Carlos...

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:34.141
...and prove you've been partners
with the biggest drug dealer...

01:37:34.307 --> 01:37:37.106
...in Mexico for eight years,
whether you knew it or not.

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:41.398
And when you put Mac away,
he puts you away.

01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:43.150
Any luck, Woody?

01:37:43.733 --> 01:37:45.326
Yeah, see you.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.079
I got to go post warning signs.

01:37:52.241 --> 01:37:54.710
Can you give me a hand?
Yeah, sure.

01:37:55.745 --> 01:37:58.043
Oh, it's gonna make
for messy headlines, Hal.

01:37:58.206 --> 01:38:01.210
At least the CIA does it on purpose.

01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:08.049
When will I see you?
Well...

01:38:08.508 --> 01:38:09.760
How about dinner?

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:13.013
What time do you want
your reservation?

01:38:13.513 --> 01:38:14.935
Seven thirty?

01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:16.933
I'll put it down.

01:38:19.769 --> 01:38:21.112
Anything else I can do?

01:38:24.774 --> 01:38:26.026
Marry me.

01:38:27.443 --> 01:38:28.695
Let's go.

01:38:29.028 --> 01:38:30.280
Let's do it now.

01:38:38.913 --> 01:38:41.883
Hey, Woody. Nick,
thanks for showing up.

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:45.671
How did you two get here?
Boat. Could you excuse us?

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:49.633
Did Woody have any trouble
getting ahold of you?

01:38:49.799 --> 01:38:51.722
No, none at all.

01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:55.013
I need you to look
after her for a while.

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.557
Either you tell me where Carlos is
right now...

01:38:57.723 --> 01:39:00.226
...or you become an accessory
to your cousin's murder.

01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:02.987
Nick, don't-- Look--
Mac, you're under arrest.

01:39:03.146 --> 01:39:06.025
I hate to pull a gun on you
but that's the way it is.

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:10.195
Oh, well, at this point, that's nothing new.
I mean, here's another gun you pulled.

01:39:15.825 --> 01:39:19.546
Well I don't believe you'll use that.
Yeah, I know how you feel, Nick.

01:39:20.663 --> 01:39:23.917
I don't get it.
I mean, you're not this stupid, Mac.

01:39:24.083 --> 01:39:27.257
I caught you.
You can't pretend you're not caught.

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:30.924
What, are you gonna spend your life
in Mexico? You can't hide there, either.

01:39:31.090 --> 01:39:33.518
You got one chance, buddy.
Turn yourself in.

01:39:33.544 --> 01:39:34.244
What for?

01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:36.895
What for?
Yeah, what for?

01:39:37.889 --> 01:39:41.063
I told you I had an accounting
problem in the restaurant.

01:39:41.225 --> 01:39:45.025
I've been holding money for someone and
he's here to pick it up. It's his money.

01:39:45.188 --> 01:39:48.067
I want to get this straight.
You'd kill me over drug money?

01:39:50.359 --> 01:39:52.111
Well, it's a lot of money.

01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:59.498
What's it gonna be, Nick?

01:40:00.536 --> 01:40:02.959
Man, I can't believe this.

01:40:04.165 --> 01:40:05.587
I really can't believe this.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:08.344
I can't believe what you've done
with your fucking life!

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:10.050
I can't believe what you've done.

01:40:10.213 --> 01:40:12.887
You figure you can do anything
you want, just like Carlos.

01:40:13.049 --> 01:40:15.802
You try to fuck her,
he tries to kill her.

01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:20.148
Woody's the only one of us worth
anything. He's got a decent job.

01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:23.852
I'll be back in an hour
and you can lock me up.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.520
Hey. Hey!

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:27.480
Oh, shit.

01:40:28.814 --> 01:40:30.111
You lied to me.

01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:34.203
You wouldn't shoot me over money.

01:40:52.588 --> 01:40:55.091
Jo Ann, you gotta tell
me where Mac's gone.

01:40:55.299 --> 01:40:57.017
Why should I?

01:40:58.135 --> 01:41:02.811
He's going to try to kill Carlos
because Carlos is trying to kill you.

01:41:18.322 --> 01:41:21.667
Ensenada, this is Little Red.
I'm approaching Pier 17.

01:41:21.826 --> 01:41:25.046
Ensenada, this is Little Red
approaching Pier 17. Over.

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:31.669
...pier 17...

01:41:34.672 --> 01:41:36.345
...pier 17...

01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:56.092
You son of a bitch!
How could you do this?

01:42:56.253 --> 01:43:01.054
Friendship is the only choice
in life you can make that's yours!

01:43:01.425 --> 01:43:06.306
You can't choose your family!
Goddamn it, I've had to face that!

01:43:07.139 --> 01:43:10.734
No man should be judged for
whatever direction his dick goes!

01:43:10.976 --> 01:43:15.823
That's like blaming a compass
for pointing north, for chrissake!

01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:18.993
Friendship is all we have.

01:43:20.903 --> 01:43:23.076
We chose each other.

01:43:23.906 --> 01:43:25.908
How could you fuck it up?

01:43:26.742 --> 01:43:29.370
How could you make
us look so bad?

01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:31.752
Welcome aboard.

01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:33.924
Here. Careful,
it's loaded.

01:43:34.083 --> 01:43:37.212
Keep it. You're gonna spend
the rest of your life in jail.

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:41.099
I'm not gonna be there to take care
of you. I'll be in a Mexican jail.

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:44.932
She's never gonna testify.
How can you say that, goddamn you?

01:43:45.094 --> 01:43:49.270
Not against her husband, and if she can't
testify against me, she can't you.

01:43:49.432 --> 01:43:51.275
She's gonna marry you? She said?
Yeah.

01:43:51.434 --> 01:43:55.314
Oh, no! No! No!

01:43:55.479 --> 01:43:59.154
Under the circumstances,
she would have said anything!

01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:01.239
She would have
fucked a snake!

01:44:02.778 --> 01:44:07.033
Come on now, be serious!
I am serious.

01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:22.675
Don't you even want to check the--
You know, wanna check below?

01:44:23.174 --> 01:44:26.269
When it comes to money,
buddy, I trust you.

01:44:26.427 --> 01:44:28.646
So, how are we gonna do this?

01:44:28.804 --> 01:44:30.477
Well, I...

01:44:31.015 --> 01:44:33.063
I don't feel like
unloading $15 million.

01:44:33.225 --> 01:44:34.693
What do you say
we swap boats?

01:44:34.852 --> 01:44:38.322
That is not exactly fair.
This is a real nice boat.

01:44:38.856 --> 01:44:40.403
The hell With it.

01:44:40.566 --> 01:44:43.069
So this is it, huh?

01:44:44.195 --> 01:44:46.038
I hope she's worth it.

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:49.500
And I hope she keeps her mouth shut.
That's all I can say.

01:44:56.999 --> 01:44:58.876
Get out of here.

01:45:01.796 --> 01:45:03.798
No, don't. Hold it.

01:45:05.549 --> 01:45:08.849
I got that thing rigged
to blow sky high.

01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:14.393
Oh, God. I'm sorry. I hated like hell having
to do that, but I didn't want her hurt.

01:45:16.185 --> 01:45:19.280
You mind undoing it?
Sure.

01:45:22.399 --> 01:45:26.029
Well, look at it this way. If you tried
anything, we both would have gone.

01:45:26.237 --> 01:45:28.035
You love her that much?

01:45:28.531 --> 01:45:30.374
Well, uh...

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:32.993
Yeah.

01:45:47.341 --> 01:45:50.561
When I first heard that, I thought
you rigged the butane stove.

01:45:50.719 --> 01:45:53.393
Well, I thought of that.
Uh, yeah, butane stove.

01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:55.809
But that's a little too
hard to control.

01:45:55.975 --> 01:45:58.569
No, the ignition
system is best.

01:46:01.063 --> 01:46:03.407
You knew?
I know you, buddy.

01:46:07.778 --> 01:46:10.156
Yeah, well,
could you hand me the--

01:46:35.014 --> 01:46:36.436
Shit.

01:46:43.856 --> 01:46:48.487
Oh, Jesus Christ,
look at that! You shot me.

01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:50.370
So what?
You shot me.

01:46:50.571 --> 01:46:54.576
Look at that! Look at my stomach!
You went too far, goddamn it!

01:46:54.742 --> 01:46:58.417
Because you're my friend, that means
you get to kill anybody you want?

01:46:58.579 --> 01:47:02.254
What the fuck is that?
Will you stop talking? It's making me sick.

01:47:02.833 --> 01:47:04.676
Jesus, that looks bad,
don't it?

01:47:04.835 --> 01:47:07.634
That's what I've been telling you,
for chrissake.

01:47:08.047 --> 01:47:09.720
Oh, shit.

01:47:09.882 --> 01:47:13.728
Now I got to get you a doctor.
Wait, wait. Don't move. Don't move.

01:47:13.886 --> 01:47:15.763
Wait a minute.

01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:17.898
I feel seasick.

01:47:19.058 --> 01:47:22.437
I think it's time for
both of us to quit.

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:24.738
I know.

01:47:26.231 --> 01:47:30.577
I've seen it coming for some time.
Cocaine is no damn good for anybody.

01:47:33.197 --> 01:47:35.199
The future...

01:47:35.366 --> 01:47:39.291
The future is grass.
Grass, buddy!

01:47:40.996 --> 01:47:44.626
I got 60 ton of Thai
stick coming in.

01:47:44.792 --> 01:47:46.760
It's on the way.

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:50.639
Oh, no.

01:47:51.715 --> 01:47:54.434
Don't do this, goddamn it!
Don't do this.

01:47:54.593 --> 01:47:56.687
Goddamn it.

01:47:58.222 --> 01:48:00.099
Oh, fuck.

01:48:06.105 --> 01:48:08.233
Freeze! I said freeze!

01:48:08.399 --> 01:48:10.902
I'm unarmed! Don't shoot!
I'm unarmed.

01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:13.704
Sure.
I'm turning myself in!

01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:15.614
Sure, go ahead.

01:48:37.636 --> 01:48:39.104
Goddamn it! Stay still!

01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:48.356
The fuck are you doing,
Maguire? Hey!

01:48:48.647 --> 01:48:50.991
He's turning himself in!

01:48:54.445 --> 01:48:56.914
Let it go, Hal!

01:49:07.124 --> 01:49:08.592
Mac!

01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:36.116
<i>Jo Ann? Nick.</i>

01:49:36.278 --> 01:49:40.249
<i>Before you open for dinner,
can you meet me down by Tower 12?</i>

01:49:47.915 --> 01:49:52.045
<i>Attention.
We have a strong riptide in this area.</i>

01:49:52.211 --> 01:49:54.805
<i>And all lifeguards
will be off duty soon.</i>

01:49:54.963 --> 01:49:58.217
<i>For your own safety,
please stay out of the water.</i>

01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:32.168
How's our friend?

01:50:32.334 --> 01:50:35.053
Fine.
<i>Fine?</i>

01:50:35.212 --> 01:50:37.385
Aside from a concussion
and powder burns...

01:50:37.548 --> 01:50:39.801
...and being generally
pissed off, yeah.

01:50:53.647 --> 01:50:55.524
Did my name come up?

01:50:55.691 --> 01:50:57.568
<i>Repeatedly.</i>

01:50:59.444 --> 01:51:02.948
Well, they're probably talking
about me right now.
