[man grunting]

00:45.170 --> 00:46.870
[man shouting]

00:47.610 --> 00:49.260
[banging]

00:59.790 --> 01:03.020
- Good evening, sir.
Looking for a little fun?

01:03.220 --> 01:06.930
- Always.
- No one will bother us
if you'd care to join me.

01:08.150 --> 01:10.340
We can do anything you want.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.420
- Get your fucking hands
off of her.

01:13.370 --> 01:17.720
I told you
you're not welcome here, Jack,
so piss the fuck off!

01:24.080 --> 01:25.700
- If this is a matter
of payment...

01:25.900 --> 01:28.610
- It's a matter of you being
a sick fucking pervert.

01:34.310 --> 01:37.670
- You should know
that that walking stick
is worth more

01:37.870 --> 01:41.750
than your putrid, rat-infested,
pathetic life.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.940
A man does have a right
to protect himself.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.940
A woman does, too.

01:56.680 --> 02:01.900
Except my girls can't
against sick, rich bastards
like you.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.900
Stay away from my girls
and boys.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.300
Or I'll carve you.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.660
[rattling]

[distant shouting]

02:27.230 --> 02:29.100

[Jack whistling]

02:48.860 --> 02:51.250

[whistling]

03:26.200 --> 03:27.810
[whistling]

03:32.560 --> 03:35.700
- Not safe is this part of town
for a...

03:35.900 --> 03:38.910
young widow at this hour.

03:44.310 --> 03:46.000
What are you hiding?

03:50.830 --> 03:52.710
Might need to take
a little peek...

03:53.530 --> 03:55.230
...at that pretty face.

03:58.490 --> 04:01.150
Although I don't know
if it's gonna stay pretty...

04:02.110 --> 04:04.020
...much longer.

04:06.550 --> 04:09.070
Oh! Ah!
[groaning]

04:09.680 --> 04:13.200
Just let me go.
I will disembowel you alive.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.340
[exclaiming]

04:18.990 --> 04:23.530
Wait. What are you... No.
Oh, what are you doing?
No, no, just... just stop.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.440
That's it. Just... just stop.
No, no, no.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.480
Let me go. No!
Let me go! Let me go.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.890
Stop! No, no, stop! Stop!
Leave me alone!

04:33.080 --> 04:34.700
Set me free at once!

04:35.400 --> 04:36.790
What are you doing?!

04:39.010 --> 04:40.450
[panting]

04:53.380 --> 04:54.990
[clanging]

04:55.770 --> 04:57.250
[exhaling]

05:10.310 --> 05:12.870
[grunting]
[eerie soundscape]

05:17.180 --> 05:18.490
[screaming]

05:20.530 --> 05:21.750
[screaming]

05:25.280 --> 05:28.320
[screaming and sobbing]

05:29.540 --> 05:31.240
[screaming]

05:41.210 --> 05:42.990
[bell tolling]

05:56.740 --> 05:58.750
You know, it's not easy,

05:58.950 --> 06:02.930
waiting here with this thing
dripping blood and God knows
what else beside you.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.710
This thing has a name.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.970
It's Alistair Simcoe.

06:09.450 --> 06:11.280
- You told me
he was called Jack.

06:12.190 --> 06:17.070
- Society man wandering
around this side of town,
he'd go by an alias.

06:17.550 --> 06:20.210
- Well, he wasn't fooling anyone
with the Jack bullshit,

06:20.410 --> 06:22.690
getting off on pretending
to be Jack the Ripper.

06:22.890 --> 06:24.650
Unless he was.

06:24.850 --> 06:28.960
You remember that woman
all chopped up years back
not too far from here?

06:29.160 --> 06:32.430
- Ah, no,
they caught the sick fuck
who trapped her...

06:34.080 --> 06:38.140
Hung him up by the neck
until it stretched out,
right, Detective? Gah!

06:38.340 --> 06:42.700
- I just don't understand.
How does someone do that
to another living being?

06:50.710 --> 06:53.970
- Looks like her killer was
using a double-bladed weapon.

06:54.710 --> 06:57.120
Yeah, here and here.

06:57.320 --> 07:01.200
Got the telltale pinching
of the skin
where two blades would meet.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.250
Large pair of shears,
I were to guess.

07:05.450 --> 07:07.740
- Yeah, I think that was
a moral question, Detective.

07:07.940 --> 07:10.260
- And how did you happen
across him?

07:10.460 --> 07:12.040
I was with a fella.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.090
He was going down
the alley there,

07:14.290 --> 07:17.880
and a lady in black raced past,
all bloody and breathy.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.130
- A woman?
- Saw her with my own eyes.
I did.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.400
And I...

07:23.600 --> 07:25.220
found him.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.490
The alleyway is very dark.

07:28.530 --> 07:31.320
How could you have possibly seen
what she was wearing?

07:31.620 --> 07:33.200
They was widow's weeds.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.750
Widow?

07:35.840 --> 07:37.450
Perfect name for a killer.

07:38.840 --> 07:42.250
- But why did you call
Mr. Simcoe Jack the Ripper?

07:42.450 --> 07:46.770
- He'd get a hard-on carving up
some of my working girls.
Carved up their faces.

07:48.290 --> 07:50.330
You ask me, he had this coming.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.290
The fuck's lucky it wasn't me.

07:55.470 --> 07:58.910
- I don't know
if I'd call that lucky.
- Outta' the way.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.090
[huffing]

08:12.270 --> 08:14.230
Glad I skipped breakfast.

08:15.580 --> 08:18.420
- Wh-what was he doing
down there?
- Tsk. My selfless sister,

08:18.610 --> 08:21.940
Venetia, has often ventured
to the dark corners of the city

08:22.140 --> 08:24.460
to administer to the needs
of the downtrodden,

08:24.660 --> 08:27.720
but only during daylight hours,
of course.

08:28.850 --> 08:31.240
Your dear, departed Alistair
was a...

08:32.380 --> 08:35.510
...a saint among men,
to be down there at night.

08:36.420 --> 08:39.260
Did he often venture
to the Devil's Elbow?

08:39.460 --> 08:41.220
Hmm?
[doorbell ringing]

08:41.420 --> 08:43.270
Ah... Oh.

08:43.470 --> 08:45.960
You have a guest.
I must be off.

08:46.160 --> 08:50.970
Our half-sister arrives
from Boston this very day.
Remember, Regina,

08:51.170 --> 08:54.960
Venetia and I
are only three houses down
if you need us.

09:07.670 --> 09:11.210
- Mrs. Simcoe,
I'm Detective Kenneth Rijkers
with the Toronto Police.

09:11.410 --> 09:15.380
- I'm afraid my neighbour,
Viviana Botticelli,
has already beaten you to it.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.650
[sighing]

09:17.850 --> 09:19.950
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.820
- If my husband
was down there...

09:24.560 --> 09:26.560
...he was down there
to help someone.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.350
Someone in desperate need of it.

09:30.430 --> 09:32.010
- Did your husband
have any enemies?

09:32.210 --> 09:34.580
Anyone that would have reason
to murder him?

09:34.780 --> 09:39.230
- He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.
- That may very well be true--

09:39.430 --> 09:41.100
It is the truth, sir.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.590
My... my husband
could not possibly...

09:44.790 --> 09:46.420
have become the target
for some kind of...

09:46.620 --> 09:49.190
premeditated murder;
he is...

09:51.930 --> 09:55.210
He was an upstanding member
of society, sir.

09:55.410 --> 09:59.390
- Mrs. Simcoe...
we want to catch who did this.

09:59.580 --> 10:02.480
And that means asking
some uncomfortable questions.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.030
I promise we will catch them.

10:06.380 --> 10:08.170
"The Widow is Here"?

10:08.690 --> 10:10.830
"Is the Widow stalking the rich,

10:11.030 --> 10:15.220
or have the poor of Toronto
finally had enough?"
Ah, bullshit.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.620
Alistair loved mucking around
in the gutter,
the poor, stupid bastard.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.580
Enid Jenkins keeps trying
to fan the flames.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.590
That Cockney bitch
will need a reminder:

10:25.790 --> 10:28.750
I own the Echo Tribune, not her.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.280
- Would you like me
to pay her a visit, Mr. Garvey?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.190
- I'd like you to rip
her fucking throat out.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.990
Get your ass down
to the Devil's Elbow,
Queen's Chamber,

10:40.190 --> 10:42.250
any dark corner where people
sell their bodies.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.730
Somebody killed Alistair, so...

10:45.420 --> 10:47.470
...somebody will have to be
dealt with.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.210
[door opening]
[barking]

10:54.950 --> 10:57.620
- I got a licence.
I own this property.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.360
I pay you fuckers
and that shit-stain Basil Garvey
enough as it is already.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.530
- If you're here to try--
- Mr. Crenshaw,
that's not why I'm here.

11:05.090 --> 11:06.790
There was a murder last night.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.460
- There's a murder every night.
- Yes.

11:09.650 --> 11:12.670
But this was a john murdered
down in the Devil's Elbow.

11:13.620 --> 11:14.810
So?

11:15.010 --> 11:17.060
- So he was a member
of the upper classes.

11:17.850 --> 11:19.330
Alistair Simcoe?

11:23.290 --> 11:24.680
You knew him?

11:26.420 --> 11:28.330
- Everyone knew
that sick sadist.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.830
Alistair did that to you?

11:45.180 --> 11:47.310
It was his idea of a tip.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.570
For my services.

11:52.660 --> 11:55.320
- Was he charged?
- A gentleman like that?

11:56.800 --> 11:59.840
I banned that piece of shit
from the Queen's Chamber
for life.

12:01.110 --> 12:02.900
We had nothing to do
with his death.

12:03.100 --> 12:07.380
- No? Because that looks
like pretty good motivation
for revenge.

12:07.580 --> 12:09.550
- We were all here last night,
Detective.

12:10.510 --> 12:13.160
Got a bar full of patrons
to verify it.

12:14.510 --> 12:16.520
You do, huh?

12:16.720 --> 12:20.870
Men who'll go on record
about spending an evening
in an establishment like this?

12:23.170 --> 12:24.430
Hey.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.870
I protect my girls and boys.

12:29.310 --> 12:32.100
Queen's Chamber is a safe place
for them and my clients,

12:32.300 --> 12:36.710
and because of that,
that demonic prick was reduced
to hunting street walkers.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.580
You want to know
who might've wanted revenge
against Alistair Simcoe?

12:41.890 --> 12:44.630
Any of the cheap pimps
and lost souls out there.

12:49.850 --> 12:52.040
When you find out who it was...

12:52.240 --> 12:53.560
tell me.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.770
I'll buy them a fucking drink.

13:03.780 --> 13:05.430
[neighing]

13:06.520 --> 13:08.130
Whoa, whoa.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.130
[horse snorting]

13:13.220 --> 13:14.960
[whinnying and snorting]

13:29.500 --> 13:31.150
[clucking]
Yah!

13:39.940 --> 13:41.290
Hello?

13:43.560 --> 13:44.780
Hello?

13:44.980 --> 13:46.430
Verdi!

13:48.210 --> 13:49.820
[chuckling]

13:51.480 --> 13:53.520
- [giggling]
- Ah.

13:55.130 --> 13:58.760
- My word.
- Look how pretty you are.
Prettier than your picture even.

13:58.950 --> 14:01.190
- It is incredible
to finally meet you

14:01.390 --> 14:03.620
after the passing
of our dear father.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.890
Sisters united in grief.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.330
- Let's get you inside,
you poor dear.

14:12.530 --> 14:13.990
You must be exhausted.

14:14.190 --> 14:16.150
- Travelling all the way
from Boston.

14:16.940 --> 14:20.390
It is so good that you're here.
[Verdi giggling]

14:20.580 --> 14:25.210
- I hope Toronto
isn't too provincial
for someone as worldly as you.

14:32.130 --> 14:33.610
Verdi, my dear?

14:34.430 --> 14:37.450
Pardon. Uh... worldly, no.

14:37.650 --> 14:39.100
Exhausted, however.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.480
- Ah.
- But you're here now.

14:42.270 --> 14:43.890
The Botticelli sisters.

14:44.090 --> 14:46.110
Finally together.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.100
[laughing]

14:49.970 --> 14:51.840
[background chatter]

14:56.850 --> 14:58.720
[man clearing throat]

15:01.290 --> 15:02.680
Hmm.

15:04.990 --> 15:08.560
- Today, I will be performing
a radical nephrectomy

15:08.760 --> 15:11.090
for a patient who suffers
from kidney disease.

15:11.290 --> 15:14.600
Now, to get to the kidney,
I must cut through muscle.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.820
[gasping]

15:19.480 --> 15:20.830
Oh.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.660
Remove some perirenal fat.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.060
Our patient enjoys his food
and his drink.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.140
- [laughter]
- Ahem.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.760
- Next,
I must remove the ureter.

15:42.940 --> 15:45.730
The tube that transfers urine
to the bladder.

15:45.930 --> 15:47.990
- She means piss.
[laughter]

15:48.680 --> 15:50.210
[laughter]

15:51.640 --> 15:53.340
And once I've snipped...

15:54.690 --> 15:56.600
...the last
of the blood vessels...

16:02.960 --> 16:05.190
[exclamations]

16:05.390 --> 16:07.360
...I can remove the kidney.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.230
[background chatter]

16:09.430 --> 16:11.880
[woman gasping]
[background chatter]
- Wait.

16:12.790 --> 16:14.330
Is that my...

16:14.520 --> 16:16.200
- Looks like somebody dropped by
for a visit.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.360
- Is that my--
- Shhh...
- My...

16:19.230 --> 16:20.940
My...
[background chatter]

16:21.140 --> 16:22.770
[woman gasping]
[laughter]

16:22.970 --> 16:25.990
- [background chatter]
- Nighty-night.
[laughter]

16:26.190 --> 16:29.730
No fingerprints or trace.
He was alive at the start
of the attack,

16:29.930 --> 16:33.650
which began at his groin
and continued up
along his spinal column.

16:33.850 --> 16:35.350
Most likely bled to death,

16:35.550 --> 16:38.000
but not before suffering
extensive damage
to his internal organs.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.570
- The knots
that were around his wrists...

16:40.770 --> 16:44.490
seem to be of a kind
common in Japan...
called the <i>hayanawa.</i>

16:44.690 --> 16:47.090
How on Earth do you know that?

16:47.910 --> 16:50.050
- I'm curious
about detective work everywhere.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.800
So our victim suspended,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.630
incapacitated, like a butterfly
on a mounting board.

16:56.830 --> 16:59.020
Yes. Why?

16:59.220 --> 17:03.770
- The victim's arms restricted,
the killer could get to work
with the shears.

17:03.970 --> 17:08.250
- And what I find interesting
about this is the attack.
It's overkill.

17:08.450 --> 17:11.860
- Not if you want to display
the body on a horse post.

17:12.060 --> 17:14.160
- Makes the murder--
- Personal.

17:14.590 --> 17:16.470
The killer is strong.

17:16.670 --> 17:18.210
Or very angry.

17:18.990 --> 17:21.080
The anger could supply
the strength.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.650
- This isn't
just a random murder.

17:24.950 --> 17:26.910
The killer's sending a message.

17:30.260 --> 17:32.830
- Bullshit.
- Please, sir, hear me out.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.880
The violence visited
upon Alistair Simcoe,

17:36.080 --> 17:37.580
it's... it's not random.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.500
This is years of hate.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.930
H-his body was put
on a horse post--

17:42.130 --> 17:45.200
- Because the killer wants
to know if a horse post
could fit in a man's ass.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.940
Now we all know.
He's a pervy, sick fuck,
just like the rest of his kind.

17:49.140 --> 17:50.460
Her kind.

17:52.150 --> 17:53.770
Witnesses say they saw a woman.

17:53.970 --> 17:55.510
- A woman?
Tying a man to a wall,

17:55.710 --> 17:59.390
giving him an ass extension
up to the back of his neck?
Come on.

17:59.590 --> 18:02.000
Son, you've been newly promoted
to detective,

18:02.200 --> 18:05.600
so you're missing
a little of the obvious.
One:

18:06.520 --> 18:10.480
You got a man with a history
of slicing the faces of guys
and gals he fucks.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.010
Two: You got a lot
of angry pimps and whores.

18:13.210 --> 18:15.400
Add some booze
and a dark, desolate street

18:15.600 --> 18:18.490
and Mr. Fancy Pants winds up
with a cave for an ass.

18:18.690 --> 18:21.150
- Sir, I suppose
I just don't see it that way.
- Mm-hmm.

18:21.350 --> 18:25.270
That's 'cause you're new, fresh.
You think you gotta
reinvent the wheel...

18:26.010 --> 18:31.150
...when the wheel just keeps
rolling through the same shit
year after year after year.

18:32.980 --> 18:35.860
- You wouldn't want us walking
on the carpets,
let along fuckin' in your beds.

18:36.060 --> 18:37.900
- I'm inviting you.
Please, come on.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.300
What we do doesn't have to be
a gutter trade.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.650
- You want to know
the biggest thing
keeping me away from there?

18:42.850 --> 18:45.950
- Pay me 10%. It's nothing.
- See, you, I can handle.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.300
It's Basil fuckin' Garvey.

18:48.950 --> 18:52.790
We work at the Queen's.
I'm putting money
in his pockets, yeah?

18:52.990 --> 18:57.130
- He owns the entire district.
Can't buy a meal down here
without giving him money.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.840
- Leave.
- Ah! Get your hands off of me!

19:01.040 --> 19:03.670
- Hey!
- Get off my street
and maybe I will!

19:03.870 --> 19:06.230
- Your street?
What are you going on about,
your street?

19:07.230 --> 19:08.850
My boss sent me down.

19:09.050 --> 19:11.550
- He doesn't own
the fuckin' pavement!

19:11.750 --> 19:15.380
- No. But he owns the walls
you and your sluts fuck against.

19:15.580 --> 19:18.630
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Calm down! Calm down.

19:20.810 --> 19:23.120
You can't force people
off a public street.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.040
Oh, really, Terrence?

19:25.240 --> 19:28.480
You want to go back
to Mr. Garvey and tell him
that's what you think?

19:28.680 --> 19:32.170
- That's what I'm talking about.
Come to the Queen's Chamber--
- You can fuck off.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.860
Yeah?

19:35.600 --> 19:37.740
And you can fuck off.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.050
And so can Basil Garvey.

19:40.250 --> 19:44.970
'Cause we're no longer gonna
be taking crap
from you rich bastards.

19:45.170 --> 19:49.020
You hear me?
Us street rats are rising up!

19:49.220 --> 19:51.020
So why don't you run off
to your bastard,

19:51.220 --> 19:53.070
and you tell him
that if he keeps this up,

19:53.270 --> 19:56.070
I'm gonna have my fist so far
up his fuckin' ass

19:56.270 --> 19:59.060
that he'll be licking
his own shit pipe
when I'm done with him.

20:01.890 --> 20:04.200
[thug chuckling]

20:05.420 --> 20:07.460
- You're gonna be sorry
you said that.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.340
Yeah... we'll see.

20:13.950 --> 20:15.690
[thug snorting]

20:16.780 --> 20:19.820
- It's for Daisy.
[man]: Go on, get off of here!

20:22.220 --> 20:23.910
[distant shouting]

20:26.310 --> 20:30.270
- [sniffling]
- Hmm. Maybe you aren't ready
for the Queen's Chamber.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.140
That was a mistake.

20:36.930 --> 20:38.580
[background chatter]

20:43.800 --> 20:45.460
[crickets chirping]

20:47.980 --> 20:51.160
- Your bedroom, it's--
- My Shangri-La.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.260
Isn't it... otherworldly?

20:54.460 --> 20:56.420
Yes, truly.

20:56.860 --> 20:59.000
Tell us, sister ours,

20:59.200 --> 21:02.090
do you have a dress
befitting a night full of magic?

21:02.290 --> 21:05.400
- I have the one I arrived in.
A-and another one
very much like it.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.710
Oh, that will not do.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.570
No, it will not do at all.
No, no.

21:12.830 --> 21:15.270
Hmm.
[gasping]

21:18.270 --> 21:20.590
This, however...
[Venetia gasping]

21:20.790 --> 21:23.110
...will make you positively...

21:23.310 --> 21:24.720
incandescent.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.720
Oh, yes! Yes.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.810
[laughing]
You'll be the belle of the ball.

21:30.630 --> 21:32.420
We're going to a ball?

21:34.200 --> 21:35.690
Even better.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.640
- Mm.
[giggling]

21:38.600 --> 21:41.650
- His bullheadedness
is putting his boys and girls
in grave danger.

21:41.850 --> 21:44.790
- It's not our problem.
- I've worked those streets
for years.

21:44.990 --> 21:46.950
- And then you built
this pleasure dome.

21:47.610 --> 21:52.970
And when Horatio winds up
spread-eagled with a hot poker
up his ass,

21:53.170 --> 21:55.840
his boys and girls
will flock to us

21:56.040 --> 21:58.320
and we'll get them at a bargain.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.270
Win-win.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.930
Please.

22:06.710 --> 22:10.370
You don't build
a business like this
without thinking like that.

22:14.070 --> 22:17.240
You're not a saint
and neither am I.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.940
That's the nature of our bond.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.690
You didn't perform last night.

22:25.430 --> 22:26.960
Oh.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.740
So...

22:28.940 --> 22:30.910
so where were you, then?

22:35.440 --> 22:37.570
Every lady has her secret.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.890
- Georges Rondeau
is an evil occultist!

22:47.090 --> 22:49.680
He is a Satanist
who cohorts with the dead!

22:49.880 --> 22:53.250
God sees it and God will punish
all who condone it!

22:53.450 --> 22:55.730
And he smote the men
of Bethshemesh,

22:55.930 --> 22:57.900
because they had looked
into the ark of the Lord,

22:58.100 --> 23:02.910
over 50,000 men,
simply for looking at
what was not theirs to admire!

23:03.110 --> 23:05.130
And you would risk this
for entertainment?

23:05.330 --> 23:07.520
We believe you will entertain
demons in hell...

23:07.720 --> 23:09.510
[woman]: Yes.
[man shouting]

23:11.390 --> 23:14.880
- I'm sure our friend over there
has strayed from the path
of righteousness

23:15.080 --> 23:16.660
at least once in his life.

23:16.860 --> 23:18.660
Every man has. Trust me.

23:18.860 --> 23:23.180
- Would you think ill of me
if I told you
even I have had impure thoughts?

23:23.880 --> 23:27.370
- Viviana, my dear,
I've encountered them before,
remember?

23:27.570 --> 23:29.020
And I hope to again.

23:29.220 --> 23:32.370
- You can have every last
thought of mine, good sir.
- Oh.

23:32.570 --> 23:36.410
- All you have to do
is get down on one knee...
and ask me to marry you.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.370
I'll be back momentarily.

23:46.250 --> 23:49.430
- Where's our sister?
- Talking to an eligible
bachelor.

23:49.630 --> 23:52.520
His father's in the pork trade,
which, of course, is déclassé,

23:52.720 --> 23:54.960
but he's richer than sin,
a perfect match.

23:55.160 --> 23:59.400
- And you'll make it clear
that we require compensation
for any love connection?

23:59.600 --> 24:03.710
- Ah, can't happen soon enough.
Selling Papa's Chippendale desk
was a bolt through my heart--

24:03.910 --> 24:05.400
- Shh-shh-shh.
Here she comes.

24:05.600 --> 24:08.800
- My sisters,
what a glorious evening.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.150
I'm so lucky.
I can't imagine a better way
to be introduced to society.

24:13.350 --> 24:17.160
- Of course.
And perhaps you might find
your Prince Charming.

24:17.350 --> 24:20.330
- Perhaps you already have.
[chuckling]
Mr. Garvey,

24:20.530 --> 24:23.510
may I introduce you
to Verdi Botticelli,

24:23.710 --> 24:26.430
our youngest sister,
newly transplanted from Boston?

24:26.630 --> 24:29.990
- Verdi, this is Basil Garvey,
the most prominent man in--

24:30.190 --> 24:33.520
- No, no, no, no.
I'm but your humble servant.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.340
And so very pleased to meet you.

24:36.950 --> 24:39.860
- And I you, Mr. Garvey,
I'm sure.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.530
My sisters speak
so very highly of you.

24:42.730 --> 24:45.710
- Oh, I don't know
how they've managed
to keep you such a secret.

24:45.910 --> 24:47.880
You Botticellis really are...

24:48.080 --> 24:49.660
a trove of treasures.

24:50.090 --> 24:52.760
Would you permit me
to escort you both...

24:52.960 --> 24:53.800
into the theatre?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.400
[chuckling]

25:06.980 --> 25:09.020
- I can't believe we're
actually seeing this...

25:09.290 --> 25:11.340
[overlapping chatter]

25:11.540 --> 25:15.420
[indistinct chatter]

25:17.600 --> 25:18.910
...I can only hope

25:19.110 --> 25:19.870
[gasping]

25:20.070 --> 25:21.000
[soft music]

25:21.200 --> 25:21.950
[shushing]

25:36.490 --> 25:38.880
[audience cheering]

25:44.930 --> 25:49.670
- Greetings, worthy supplicants
to the darkest of arts.

25:50.590 --> 25:54.680
Welcome, timid hearts
and frightened souls.

25:56.030 --> 25:58.550
If you doubted coming here,
it's too late.

25:59.550 --> 26:03.000
If you feared
what I might do to you,

26:03.200 --> 26:04.990
it is already done.

26:05.910 --> 26:09.140
You are under my power

26:09.340 --> 26:13.920
and ready to receive that
which you so secretly crave.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.400
Welcome...

26:15.600 --> 26:17.100
to the...

26:17.300 --> 26:19.360
underworld.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.630
[audience gasping]
[applause]

26:22.830 --> 26:24.800
[gasping]
[applause]

26:29.670 --> 26:31.590
You're perfectly safe, Verdi.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.710
[exclamations]
[delighted laughter]

27:04.910 --> 27:07.270
- [laughter]
- Oh!

27:23.510 --> 27:25.200
[audience gasping]

27:33.300 --> 27:36.520
- We don't know
what might happen here tonight.

27:38.560 --> 27:43.440
The forces I work with are...
peculiar... and deadly.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.180
[sinister music]

27:59.460 --> 28:01.410
[audience murmuring]

28:12.420 --> 28:15.570
No one is immune to the danger
in this world,

28:15.770 --> 28:20.090
as I'm sure the rich men
in this city
are now only too aware.

28:20.290 --> 28:22.660
[man chuckling]
Ah, well.

28:22.860 --> 28:25.480
While they all nurse
their tender backsides...

28:26.090 --> 28:30.710
...let us begin
with a ceremonial bloodletting,

28:30.910 --> 28:33.710
as I take my dear assistant,
Shanika...

28:34.800 --> 28:37.150
...and saw her in half!

28:40.890 --> 28:42.810
Dark agents...

28:43.010 --> 28:46.940
abide by the rules of life
and decency.

28:53.770 --> 28:56.160
I've never used this saw before.

29:00.650 --> 29:02.260
[groaning]

29:03.740 --> 29:07.880
[panting]
The last one broke
on my previous assistant's bone.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.010
- Jeez!
[screaming]
[audience exclaiming]

29:12.140 --> 29:14.100
[screaming]

29:15.400 --> 29:18.020
So I made sure
this one was very...

29:18.220 --> 29:19.850
[grunting]
...very...

29:20.050 --> 29:21.760
[screaming]
...sharp!

29:23.060 --> 29:24.980
I cannot bear to witness this!

29:25.180 --> 29:28.630
- [Shanika sobbing]
- It's just a magic trick,
my dear.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.300
That's the thing about magic.

29:43.860 --> 29:47.170
It comes... at a great cost.

29:53.130 --> 29:54.700
Shanika.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.490
My dear.

30:00.750 --> 30:02.490
My beauty.

30:03.140 --> 30:04.840
Oh, what have I done?

30:08.450 --> 30:09.770
Gone.

30:09.970 --> 30:11.940
And all my fault.

30:12.630 --> 30:14.420
- Oh.
- Ah...

30:16.590 --> 30:18.690
[gasping]

30:18.890 --> 30:20.340
Thankfully...

30:20.540 --> 30:23.640
I possess the power of Osiris.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.170
I shall restore her...

30:29.000 --> 30:30.780
...at great cost.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.960
[groaning]

30:41.920 --> 30:43.620
[groaning]

30:45.190 --> 30:47.230
[reciting incantation]

30:51.630 --> 30:53.590
[incantation continues]

31:00.420 --> 31:02.200
[incantation continues]

31:04.730 --> 31:06.080
...to life!

31:14.480 --> 31:16.430
[audience exclaiming]

31:17.570 --> 31:19.060
[exclaiming]

31:19.250 --> 31:21.310
[audience cheering]

31:24.180 --> 31:26.880
[applause]
[wild cheering]

31:30.060 --> 31:31.710
<i>Magique, mes amis.</i>

31:32.450 --> 31:33.840
<i>Magique...</i>

31:34.500 --> 31:36.110
<i>...pour vous.</i>

31:43.900 --> 31:45.680
[sinister music]

32:23.760 --> 32:25.290
Needles.

32:41.650 --> 32:43.350
You have a fetish, Detective?

32:44.310 --> 32:45.960
I don't think so.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.090
- I'd hate to have to tell
Superintendent Kashtinsky
that I suspected that.

32:52.360 --> 32:56.940
- I was certain there had to be
some sort of clue on the body.
- You don't trust my work?

32:57.140 --> 32:59.420
Uh... no.

32:59.620 --> 33:01.980
No, that's not it. I....

33:03.320 --> 33:06.460
I can have a hard time
letting go of things.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.680
I obsess.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.510
Our friend had a lot of vices.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.080
- Not unusual in those
who frequent sex workers.

33:26.650 --> 33:28.570
Right there.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.220
You feel that?

33:34.620 --> 33:36.660
What do you suppose that is?

33:53.980 --> 33:55.590
[grunting softly]

34:17.620 --> 34:19.140
[exhaling]

34:19.790 --> 34:21.230
Oh.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.200
Quite unique, Detective.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.020
You realize that?

34:42.950 --> 34:44.690
[panting softly]

34:46.600 --> 34:48.170
[groaning]

34:50.040 --> 34:51.880
- The boa-constrictor knot...

34:52.080 --> 34:54.870
is a secret
of the Egyptian royal family.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.960
[groaning]

34:58.870 --> 35:03.620
There are only three people
who have managed to escape it...
ever.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.360
[groaning]

35:07.930 --> 35:10.290
[strained]: Two of them...

35:10.490 --> 35:14.020
eventually died...
from its mysteries.
[panting]

35:15.850 --> 35:17.470
- Sir.
- One...
- Shhh.

35:17.670 --> 35:19.380
...muscular consort...

35:19.580 --> 35:21.120
- Shhh.
- ...of the queen...

35:21.320 --> 35:23.390
of the Ptolemaic Kingdom
itself...

35:23.590 --> 35:25.390
[whispering]

35:25.590 --> 35:27.520
...Cleopatra is said

35:27.720 --> 35:30.510
to have witnessed
his beautiful head...

35:31.520 --> 35:35.350
[panting]
...constricted until
it popped right off

35:35.550 --> 35:37.880
and landed in her lap.
[groaning]

35:38.080 --> 35:42.140
- If it gets too scary,
just close those beautiful eyes
of yours.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.490
So if I die...

35:46.920 --> 35:49.280
[groaning]
...its dark secret

35:49.480 --> 35:51.100
dies with me

35:51.800 --> 35:53.840
and my severed head.

35:54.410 --> 35:57.680
- Sir, we found this
in Alistair Simcoe's body.

35:57.880 --> 36:01.630
- I don't need to see everything
shoved up his ass.
- Just read it.

36:05.070 --> 36:06.910
- "Alistair was first,
one of many.

36:07.110 --> 36:10.250
The other gents will bleed
from wounds aplenty.

36:10.860 --> 36:12.560
Friends of Margaret...

36:14.650 --> 36:16.730
...are my target."

36:19.430 --> 36:22.230
- I can head
to the Simcoe residence
first thing in the morning.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.060
You'll go there now.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.970
- Sir, it's late.
Mrs. Simcoe's in mourning.

36:27.170 --> 36:28.970
- That maniac is out there,
free as a bird.

36:29.170 --> 36:32.760
I don't want them taunting us
and lining up their next kill.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.150
On the double, then, sir.

36:35.350 --> 36:37.410
Report back whatever you find.

36:38.190 --> 36:40.190
- Any update
on Alistair's murder?

36:40.890 --> 36:42.420
We don't know just yet.

36:42.620 --> 36:44.550
But one thing is clear.

36:45.110 --> 36:47.910
Things are very dangerous
for people like us.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.690
- People like us?
What do you mean?

36:49.890 --> 36:51.860
- People who were there
that night...

36:53.120 --> 36:55.340
[distant barking]
...12 years ago.

37:06.830 --> 37:10.320
- Why could this not wait
until morning?
- My apologies, Mrs. Simcoe,

37:10.520 --> 37:12.400
but I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

37:13.140 --> 37:15.840
We found new evidence
on your husband's body.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.320
On his body?

37:21.060 --> 37:23.890
- It begins,
"Alistair was but--"
- I prefer to read it myself.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.280
- Well, there's...
there's bloodstains on it,
Mrs. Simcoe. You...

37:45.520 --> 37:47.910
- I can make neither heads
nor tails of it.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.710
Who's Margaret?

37:50.910 --> 37:52.870
- Well, I was hoping
you could tell me.

37:56.490 --> 37:59.450
- I've never ventured inside
my husband's office before.

38:02.100 --> 38:04.760
[creaking]
It's like I can feel him.

38:06.280 --> 38:09.370
[door closing]
Like Alistair is in here
with us.

38:10.940 --> 38:12.590
Right beside me.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.290
I've been told I have the gift.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.260
[dissonant music]

38:31.300 --> 38:33.180
Well, this is a revelation.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.090
[gasping]

38:45.060 --> 38:46.980
- Mrs. Simcoe--
- If you continue
to presume yourself

38:47.180 --> 38:50.580
to be of stronger mettle
than me,
I will ask you to leave.

39:05.340 --> 39:06.770
[rattling]

39:07.510 --> 39:10.210
- I don't have a key.
- You won't need one.

39:29.930 --> 39:33.640
- What a truly wondrous evening!
However did you learn
all those tricks?

39:33.840 --> 39:36.330
And all those lovely people
wearing such finery!

39:36.530 --> 39:39.950
I've never experienced
such an enchanting evening
in my entire life!

39:40.150 --> 39:43.300
- [exclaiming]
- Enchanting?!
I think you mean bewitching!

39:43.500 --> 39:47.640
Like how you tried
to bewitch Basil Garvey
and steal him from me!

39:48.210 --> 39:51.440
- I did nothing of the sort.
- We opened our doors
and our arms to you.

39:51.640 --> 39:55.430
Our hearts!
And this is how you repay us?
How you repay me?!

39:55.870 --> 39:59.350
For replacing
your flea-bitten clothes
with one of my gowns?!

39:59.910 --> 40:03.310
Basil's the man I love.
He is promised to me!

40:03.830 --> 40:07.890
And he will see through you,
because his love for me is pure!

40:08.090 --> 40:10.150
His love for me is pure.

40:10.350 --> 40:15.330
- I swear to you, sister,
I have no designs on Mr. Garvey.
- I see through you, you viper!

40:15.530 --> 40:19.550
You cast off my dress
like a serpent sloughs off
its skin!

40:19.750 --> 40:21.420
[Verdi exclaiming]
Go!

40:21.620 --> 40:23.210
[exclaiming]

40:23.410 --> 40:25.680
And let me not see you anymore
this night!

40:40.390 --> 40:43.310
- I... I swear to you, Venetia,
our sister has misconstrued
things.

40:43.510 --> 40:45.450
I would never try to steal
her true love.

40:45.650 --> 40:46.790
Wouldn't you?

40:47.740 --> 40:49.490
No, that's not who I am.

40:50.270 --> 40:53.180
And who are you, Verdi? Truly.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.410
Our father's
illegitimate daughter,
the spawn of a whore.

41:01.280 --> 41:06.070
Your blood is tainted with hers,
which is why on his deathbed,
our dear father sent you to us.

41:06.850 --> 41:10.290
So that Viviana and I
might forge a virtuous woman
out of you.

41:11.070 --> 41:15.770
So that you might become
worthy enough to be betrothed
to a man of your station.

41:24.130 --> 41:25.780
Drape yourself over me.

41:27.610 --> 41:28.840
What?

41:29.040 --> 41:31.140
Disease requires medicine.

41:33.220 --> 41:34.840
I have the cure.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.120
That's a good girl.

42:01.690 --> 42:03.430
There's hope for you yet.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.220
[crying out]

42:07.420 --> 42:08.960
Oh, no.

42:10.610 --> 42:12.350
We're only getting started.

Toronto's biggest oak

in that sweet ass of yours
in exchange for a bank note
or two?

42:31.540 --> 42:33.690
What? Too girthy for ya?

42:33.890 --> 42:37.770

to have a good time,

I suggest you

Alistair left everything to me

It seems I've kept you up
for no reason.

43:50.530 --> 43:54.060
- No. No,
you had a very good reason.

Unfortunately,
Alistair is being of no help
from beyond the grave.

- The cab drawers.
