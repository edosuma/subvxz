00:03.699 --> 00:06.397
<i>Dr. Marcel,
you saved Nathaniel's life</i>

00:06.397 --> 00:08.443
<i>in spectacular fashion.</i>

00:08.443 --> 00:10.314
Got 30 million
social media followers waiting

00:10.314 --> 00:11.620
<i>to hear how this story ends.</i>

00:11.620 --> 00:13.535
Get ready
for what comes next.

00:13.535 --> 00:14.666
What's that?

00:14.666 --> 00:16.146
Fame.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.626
What the hell is going on?

00:17.626 --> 00:19.367
<i>Will and Vanessa bought
meds off a drug dealer.</i>

00:19.367 --> 00:20.977
It's a little more
complicated than that.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.892
You want to risk
your own career, that's fine.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.676
Don't risk Vanessa's.

00:24.676 --> 00:25.677
April?

00:25.677 --> 00:27.462
Are you back in Chicago?
- Yeah.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.507
You didn't get married
or anything, did you?

00:29.507 --> 00:30.508
No.

00:30.508 --> 00:33.381
<i>Well, I'll see you around.</i>

00:54.706 --> 00:58.188
Did you really ask Jack
to dislocate your shoulder?

00:58.188 --> 01:00.843
Uh, didn't have much
of a choice, really.

01:00.843 --> 01:01.974
I couldn't believe it.

01:01.974 --> 01:03.280
Didn't even hesitate.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.805
Well, my arm was trapped,
uh, at the time.

01:06.805 --> 01:10.548
I felt it was the--the best way
to continue treating Mr. Perry.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.246
Well, no wonder people
are calling you a hero.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.770
But is that how you would
characterize yourself?

01:16.511 --> 01:18.774
Did you know that he, um,
jerry-rigged a lung transplant

01:18.774 --> 01:21.255
just days after the incident?
Yes.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.996
Confident, creative,
future of medicine, this guy.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.520
Uh, it--it was a team effort.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.217
Look, I'm--
I'm sure you'd rather talk

01:27.217 --> 01:28.436
to Mr. Dayton here.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.655
And my shift is
starting soon, so--

01:30.655 --> 01:34.659
Dr. Marcel exemplifies the
kind of selfless dedication

01:34.659 --> 01:36.705
we here at Gaffney
pride ourselves on,

01:36.705 --> 01:39.577
and it's what has attracted
a new crop

01:39.577 --> 01:42.406
of generous donations
to this institution.

01:42.406 --> 01:44.539
Dr. Marcel's heroics
that day saved

01:44.539 --> 01:47.063
way more than just one life.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.151
- That's very generous.
- Mm.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.761
- Thank you.
- And we're cut.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.067
- Hey.
- Yeah?

01:51.067 --> 01:52.982
So I got you lined up
for a few phoners...

01:52.982 --> 01:54.418
- Uh-huh.
- Later in the day.

01:54.418 --> 01:56.159
And then we got "Today Show"
end of the week, okay?

01:56.159 --> 01:57.204
Friday, we're gonna try
to do that.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.820
Morning, Mags.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.864
How's it going?

02:05.864 --> 02:07.257
It's going.

02:07.257 --> 02:10.391
I have a twisted ankle
for you in 5.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.827
Be there in a minute.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.179
You're still mad at him?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.616
CPD and the hospital
cleared us both.

02:18.616 --> 02:21.967
They're letting it go.
Why can't you?

02:21.967 --> 02:25.797
Because you brought drugs
into the hospital, Vanessa.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.582
It was irresponsible.
It was dangerous.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.845
We were out of options,
and it saved our patient.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.455
I expect that kind
of foolishness from Will,

02:31.455 --> 02:32.630
but he should have
known better than

02:32.630 --> 02:33.718
to drag you down with him.
- No, no.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.111
Will didn't drag me
into anything.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.678
It was my call.
- You don't have to defend him.

02:36.678 --> 02:39.333
I get it--the Halstead School
of Medicine has its appeal,

02:39.333 --> 02:40.682
but it's not who you are.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.249
What is that
supposed to mean?

02:42.249 --> 02:43.815
It means you're not reckless.
You're smarter than that.

02:43.815 --> 02:46.166
And you don't have to be
a cowboy to be a good doctor.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.562
Hey, Dean.
How you doing?

02:51.562 --> 02:53.521
Oh, well, I thought a
patient's bowel was nicked

02:53.521 --> 02:56.001
during surgery, but it was
just a flatulent intern,

02:56.001 --> 02:57.612
so I'm excellent.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.962
Great, but I meant
how are your injuries?

02:59.962 --> 03:01.311
You're looking a little stiff.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.704
I've had worse.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.401
Oh, than being brutally
attacked by a patient

03:04.401 --> 03:05.968
on PCP-laced cocaine?

03:05.968 --> 03:07.143
I need to hear your life story.

03:07.143 --> 03:08.666
Oh, another time.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.016
Uh, I seem to remember
being in considerable pain

03:11.016 --> 03:12.583
when you patched me up.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.585
So if I do need anything,
I'll be looking elsewhere.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.370
Well, lucky me,
seeing as doctors,

03:16.370 --> 03:18.546
especially surgeons
with God complexes,

03:18.546 --> 03:20.330
make the worst patient.

03:20.330 --> 03:22.463
Help! Someone, please!
crying]

03:22.463 --> 03:23.942
Please, I need help!

03:23.942 --> 03:25.944
- Okay, what happened?
- Please, take him!

03:25.944 --> 03:28.425
T--tell me what's wrong.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.775
It's me.
I'm what's wrong.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.736
I'm gonna hurt him.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.840
I'll be right back.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.363
Her son, Edison,
is in Treatment 2.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.713
He shows no signs
of abuse or neglect.

03:55.713 --> 03:57.759
He's an entirely
healthy newborn.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.761
Oh, that's a relief.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.893
Penelope, however,
is not in great shape.

04:01.893 --> 04:05.593
She's dehydrated, anemic,
and is low in vitamin D.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.116
It certainly doesn't
look like she's been taking

04:07.116 --> 04:08.335
very good care of herself.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.163
Well, that's not unusual
for a new mother,

04:11.163 --> 04:13.340
but it could mean she doesn't
have much of a support system.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.428
Yeah.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.604
Listen, I don't
want to call DCFS,

04:16.604 --> 04:19.215
but she did say that
she was gonna hurt her baby.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.261
Are you guys comfortable
holding off for now?

04:21.261 --> 04:24.046
Absolutely--that's
a drastic step for something

04:24.046 --> 04:26.962
that just might be postpartum
depression and treatable.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.964
Yeah, we're not there yet,
but I--I should have

04:28.964 --> 04:30.487
a little chat with her, though.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.749
Yeah.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.493
Halstead!

04:36.493 --> 04:37.929
Incoming. Going to Baghdad.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.801
Says she doesn't
want any doc but you.

04:39.801 --> 04:42.194
Okay.

04:42.194 --> 04:44.806
76-year-old female.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.851
Tell the whole world, madonna.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.810
Maria. What happened?

04:48.810 --> 04:50.464
Crush injury
to the right upper arm.

04:50.464 --> 04:51.726
Lacerations above the elbow.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.162
Denied pain meds on the ride.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.946
I was just moving the stove.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.557
What,
Anthony couldn't move it?

04:56.557 --> 04:58.080
He's useless.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.560
Okay, in we go. On my count.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.648
I can do it myself!

05:00.648 --> 05:02.345
Please lie still, okay?

05:02.345 --> 05:04.782
Okay. One, two, three.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.436
I need an X-ray!

05:06.436 --> 05:09.744
All this fussing, Guglielmo. <i>Basta.</i>

05:09.744 --> 05:10.788
All right, I'm sorry.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.400
So you two know each other?

05:13.400 --> 05:18.143
Maria owns Marguerite's.
Taylor Street institution.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.406
When my folks were alive,
we'd go there

05:19.406 --> 05:20.755
every Sunday for dinner.

05:20.755 --> 05:22.452
Not so much recently, huh?

05:22.452 --> 05:25.107
You look skinny.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.587
Uh, diminished
right radial pulse.

05:26.587 --> 05:27.936
Any numbness, tingling?

05:27.936 --> 05:28.937
- Mm-mm.
- Good.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.765
Let's get a CT angio.

05:36.988 --> 05:38.338
X-ray up.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.776
Hey, no fractures,
but those lacerations

05:41.776 --> 05:42.951
still need to be repaired.

05:42.951 --> 05:43.908
Let me get you some pain meds.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.345
Oh, so I go to sleep?

05:45.345 --> 05:48.173
No, I have a dinner
service tonight.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.523
Uh, Maria, I'm sorry,
but I--I doubt

05:49.523 --> 05:50.959
that's gonna be possible.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.308
We'll know more once
we get better imaging,

05:52.308 --> 05:53.962
but I'm gonna call
a surgical consult.

05:53.962 --> 05:56.051
Surgery? No, no, no.

05:56.051 --> 05:59.228
If you think Antonio can
run Marguerite's--oh-ho!

05:59.228 --> 06:01.709
Let's worry about that later.
You just relax.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.799
Hey, I'm gonna
take care of you.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.017
<i>Va bene.</i>

06:09.760 --> 06:11.414
Hi, Caitlin. I'm Dr. Asher.

06:11.414 --> 06:12.633
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:12.633 --> 06:13.808
This is my husband, Steve.
- How are you?

06:13.808 --> 06:15.418
Hi, Steve. Okay.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.985
So Caitlin, I saw that
you're nine weeks pregnant

06:16.985 --> 06:18.595
and experiencing spotting?
- Yes.

06:18.595 --> 06:21.163
It just started a day ago,
but it hasn't been super heavy.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.991
- Okay. Any pain or cramping?
- Nope.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.385
I read it could be normal
this early, right?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.474
It doesn't necessarily mean
that something's wrong?

06:27.474 --> 06:29.432
That's true, but it is wise
to get checked out.

06:29.432 --> 06:34.350
So let's get a type and screen,
a CBC, and a quantitative HCG.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.874
It's taken us some time
for us to get pregnant,

06:36.874 --> 06:39.268
so we're probably
a little more neurotic

06:39.268 --> 06:41.270
than most first-time parents.

06:41.270 --> 06:44.012
Okay, so Caitlin,
I'd like to do an ultrasound.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.014
It'll have to be
transvaginal this early.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.929
Ah, yes.
The joys of being a woman.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.018
Yes.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.455
Okay, let's get you set up.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.631
Here we go.

06:54.631 --> 06:55.676
A little bit of pressure.

06:55.676 --> 06:56.894
Mm-hmm.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.420
Let's see.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.601
What? What is it?

07:10.386 --> 07:13.258
I'm very sorry,
but it's an ectopic pregnancy.

07:13.258 --> 07:16.218
The embryo has implanted
in your fallopian tube.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.524
What does that mean?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.743
Won't it move to the uterus?
- No.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.484
No, it's not even viable.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.268
Unfortunately,
that's correct.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.053
We need to remove the ectopic

07:25.053 --> 07:26.533
before it can rupture
the fallopian tube,

07:26.533 --> 07:28.970
which would be fatal
for Caitlin.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.279
Okay, so, uh, what, uh--
what do I have to do?

07:34.279 --> 07:35.542
Well, we have
two different options.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.632
The first is a chemo drug
called methotrexate.

07:38.632 --> 07:41.635
It stops the cells
from rapidly dividing

07:41.635 --> 07:43.071
and ends the pregnancy.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.813
The embryo ultimately
reabsorbs back in the body,

07:45.813 --> 07:47.597
and it successfully
treats about 90%

07:47.597 --> 07:49.773
of ectopic pregnancies.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.253
And how do you get that?

07:51.253 --> 07:52.515
It's an intramuscular shot,

07:52.515 --> 07:54.212
typically in the buttock
or the thigh.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.823
What are your other options?

07:55.823 --> 07:58.216
We would operate to remove
the embryo and, if necessary,

07:58.216 --> 07:59.566
the entire fallopian tube.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.438
The shot.
Please, no surgery.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.048
We're hourly workers
at a bookstore.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.528
We don't get sick days.

08:05.528 --> 08:06.834
I understand.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.271
We'll just have to do
some additional labs,

08:09.271 --> 08:11.273
and then we'll go
from there, okay?

08:13.231 --> 08:14.972
Try and get some rest.
- Thank you.

08:17.105 --> 08:20.282
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.588
I'm sorry.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.504
It'll be okay, all right?
Look at me.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.337
Penelope?

08:32.337 --> 08:33.948
How's Edison? Is he okay?

08:33.948 --> 08:35.297
Oh, he's fine.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.125
He's just next door.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.475
Does he need breast milk?
I express him.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.129
He's not always great
about waking up to eat,

08:41.129 --> 08:42.652
even if it's been two hours.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.437
You know what?
I'll--I'll tell the nurses.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.787
I'm Dr. Charles.

08:46.787 --> 08:49.224
Psychiatry.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.748
Maybe I have
postpartum depression?

08:51.748 --> 08:53.968
You know, I don't know.
Tell me what's been going on.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.273
How you been feeling?

08:56.797 --> 09:01.149
Oh, um, I'm not like myself.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.193
Okay.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.544
I cry so easily.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.372
My moods are all
over the place, and--

09:07.372 --> 09:09.331
and I have this ringing
in my ears,

09:09.331 --> 09:12.552
but my OB says it's all part
of the recovery process.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.857
Hmm.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.077
But Edison was crying
so loudly, and I was--

09:16.077 --> 09:17.644
I was so tired.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.298
And it's not an excuse,
I know, but...

09:22.387 --> 09:25.260
I thought about, uh...

09:26.914 --> 09:28.393
I thought--I--

09:28.393 --> 09:30.613
I thought about throwing
him against the wall?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.006
Okay.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.616
Well, it was just a thought, though.

09:33.616 --> 09:34.965
Right?
- Mm-hmm.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.837
Has--has Edison's dad
been around to help out?

09:36.837 --> 09:40.623
Turns out
he wasn't ready for a kid.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.191
Well, gosh, I mean,
that's got to be so hard,

09:43.191 --> 09:45.672
facing a life-changing
situation like this

09:45.672 --> 09:47.456
all--all by yourself.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.634
My mom came out
for the first week,

09:51.634 --> 09:53.418
but she had to get back
to Ohio.

09:53.418 --> 09:54.724
How's it been since she left?

09:54.724 --> 09:57.553
Mm, hard.

09:57.553 --> 10:00.208
Uh, my job doesn't have
paid maternity leave,

10:00.208 --> 10:03.080
so I've been working
from home, you know,

10:03.080 --> 10:06.083
juggling phone calls while
I breastfeed every two hours.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.389
And there are no breaks

10:07.389 --> 10:11.567
and there's no time
to, like, turn off.

10:11.567 --> 10:16.093
And his cry,
like a screech, it--

10:16.093 --> 10:17.878
it's just--it's too much.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.097
I--I can't.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.751
I know it's his only way
to communicate,

10:21.751 --> 10:24.536
but it sets my teeth on edge,
and I feel like I'm losing it.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.582
So I just--

10:26.582 --> 10:28.453
I'm sorry.

10:28.453 --> 10:31.587
Can you please just--
just tell me what--

10:31.587 --> 10:33.154
You know what?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.330
We're gonna--we're gonna get
to the bottom of this, okay?

10:35.330 --> 10:37.158
I promise you, we will.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.121
Thank you.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.914
No, no, I will make that
flight, and I'm fine.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.089
My doctor just walked in, okay?

10:59.180 --> 11:00.616
- It's good to see you, Samir.
- You too.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.923
Mr. Baqri, I'm Dr. Taylor.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.359
Yeah. So sorry about that.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.578
My work never stops.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.450
And please, call me Samir.

11:08.450 --> 11:09.625
What seems to be the problem?

11:09.625 --> 11:12.410
Um, lethargy, myalgia.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.585
It's hard to pin down.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.065
Ah, you're a physician.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.806
Oh, no.
I--I work with them.

11:16.806 --> 11:19.853
Samir runs the Hamsa
Community Health Foundation,

11:19.853 --> 11:21.071
sets up clinics all
around the world.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.159
Mm-hmm.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.595
Mm, I get your
fundraising emails.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.293
Ah, wow.
Hopefully, not too many.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.904
I haven't unsubscribed yet.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.514
Okay, let's check this out.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.342
Open up.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.562
You know, your polio
vaccination program

11:33.562 --> 11:35.607
in Pakistan, incredible.
- Ah.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.348
I was obsessed
with infectious disease

11:37.348 --> 11:39.655
in med school, but they would
always talk about polio

11:39.655 --> 11:40.743
in the past tense,
and I wanted to shout

11:40.743 --> 11:41.918
at my professors that--

11:41.918 --> 11:43.398
We were still
fighting it, right.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.965
You know, we almost
had it beat, but then the world

11:44.965 --> 11:47.271
took its foot off the gas,
started reallocating funding,

11:47.271 --> 11:49.360
and now it's back,
and well, you know,

11:49.360 --> 11:51.623
we are struggling to get
buy-in from our partners.

11:51.623 --> 11:54.801
It's just, uh--ugh, I'm sorry.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.977
I will step off
of my soapbox now.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.761
No, do not apologize.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.328
You're doing something.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.808
I wish I knew how to help.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.592
It's the entire reason
that I got into medicine.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.637
But instead,
I just turn off the news,

12:05.637 --> 12:07.291
and I eat a sleeve of Oreos.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.728
But you know what?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.120
At least now
I can help the helper.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.295
Right.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.950
So how long have you
felt this way?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.299
Um, a couple of weeks.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.954
I've been traveling
for work a lot recently--

12:17.954 --> 12:21.001
Indonesia, Pakistan,
Sierra Leone.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.003
I leave for the Philippines
on Friday.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.700
I'm opening up a new clinic.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.311
Well, the most exotic place
I've ever been is San Antonio,

12:27.311 --> 12:29.923
and that was for a conference.
- So no interest in travel?

12:29.923 --> 12:31.925
No, I'd love to.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.144
But between school
and residency, it's just--

12:34.144 --> 12:35.972
Well, let me tell you,
it's not always so glamorous.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.453
I'm glued to my phone,
and I survive

12:38.453 --> 12:40.716
off of peanut butter
protein bars and coffee.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.198
Temp's normal.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.808
Well, you know,
I'm not seeing

12:45.808 --> 12:47.331
any obvious signs of infection,

12:47.331 --> 12:49.464
but given your travel history,
uh, I just want to cast

12:49.464 --> 12:50.639
a bit of a wide net
with your bloodwork,

12:50.639 --> 12:51.901
if that's okay.
- Yeah.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.555
Anything that gets me
on a flight, I'm good.

12:53.555 --> 12:56.819
Uh, CBC, CMP,
bacterial and viral cultures,

12:56.819 --> 12:59.039
O&P, and a sputum.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.823
On it.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.216
I don't understand.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.000
You said that most people
can do the drug option.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.262
Unfortunately,
your liver function tests

13:05.262 --> 13:06.524
were a little
too elevated,

13:06.524 --> 13:09.049
so you are not a candidate
for methotrexate.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.703
Is there something you can do
so that I can get the shot?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.009
I can't do a big surgery.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.490
It'll put me out
of work for weeks.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.797
If we were to fully
open up your abdomen, yes,

13:17.797 --> 13:19.929
the healing time
would take a lot longer.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.018
Fortunately, this procedure
is laparoscopic,

13:22.018 --> 13:24.455
minimally invasive,
meaning we could likely

13:24.455 --> 13:26.718
send you home tonight
and have you back at work

13:26.718 --> 13:27.981
in a day or two.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.550
Okay.
I guess I can do a day or two.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.509
Okay. I'll see you soon.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.250
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

13:46.608 --> 13:49.089
Hey. How'd it go?

13:49.089 --> 13:50.960
A couple of red flags
for postpartum,

13:50.960 --> 13:52.919
but I'm not convinced yet.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.790
You know, she was talking
about this ringing

13:54.790 --> 13:56.574
she had in her ears.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.446
Well, tinnitus could be
caused by multiple things.

13:58.446 --> 14:00.404
It could be idiopathic, medications,

14:00.404 --> 14:01.884
hypo or hyperthyroidism.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.277
You know, I can work
all of those up,

14:03.277 --> 14:05.061
but what do you want
to do in the meantime?

14:05.061 --> 14:08.499
Honestly, I want
to see her with her kid.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.936
Wait, Dr. Charles.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.589
You didn't see her
when she came in.

14:11.589 --> 14:12.895
She was frantic.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.854
And we can't be sure
how she'll react to him,

14:14.854 --> 14:16.986
especially without
a definitive diagnosis.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.901
Absolutely gonna make sure
the kid is safe, okay?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.903
It's just that
I can learn so much

14:20.903 --> 14:22.078
from watching them interact, right?

14:22.078 --> 14:23.906
How are they bonding?

14:23.906 --> 14:25.560
Any warning signs
of a lack of connection?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.823
And if it is postpartum,
it sort of helps me

14:27.823 --> 14:30.086
gauge the severity, you know?

14:30.086 --> 14:33.481
While I understand
your concerns, Dr. Choi,

14:33.481 --> 14:37.224
since Dr. Charles
will be there and Penelope

14:37.224 --> 14:39.835
had the wherewithal
to ask for help

14:39.835 --> 14:41.576
before anything happened,

14:41.576 --> 14:43.926
I think we should proceed.

14:43.926 --> 14:48.061
Also, I'd like to be present.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.019
All right. Hey, thank you.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.982
- Hey, Archer!
- Yeah?

14:55.982 --> 14:57.635
Nursing said
there's no fiber optic cables

14:57.635 --> 14:59.942
for the laparoscopic tower.
Where'd they all go?

14:59.942 --> 15:01.465
I've got to do
an urgent ectopic.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.902
I know we're down two.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.468
Supply chain issue
strike again.

15:04.468 --> 15:05.905
Can't you just open?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.341
No, it's explicitly
against my patient's wishes.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.733
She needs it
to be laparoscopic.

15:08.733 --> 15:09.952
Oh.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.998
So both options are bad.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.608
Either wait it out,
running the risk

15:13.608 --> 15:16.916
it ruptures and kills her,
or turf it to another hospital.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.961
Or you can go
old school without video

15:18.961 --> 15:22.486
and just look straight
down into the scope.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.749
No one's learned how to do it
that way since the Stone Age.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.229
That's like performing surgery

15:26.229 --> 15:27.709
with one hand tied
behind your back.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.928
Eh, yeah.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.668
I'm ancient enough, all right?

15:30.668 --> 15:32.844
It's how I was trained.

15:32.844 --> 15:35.847
Well, this doesn't
do me any good.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.681
Oh, hi. Hey.
So, uh, what's the good news?

15:43.681 --> 15:45.031
We're not seeing
any signs of infection,

15:45.031 --> 15:46.423
though you are slightly anemic.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.816
Which would explain
your lethargy.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.513
Excellent, so I guess I can
just take a couple

15:49.513 --> 15:51.167
of iron supplements,
be on my way?

15:51.167 --> 15:52.952
I'm actually not comfortable
discharging you quite yet.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.170
You just said
I'm not infectious.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.606
That's true,
as far as I can tell.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.087
But without an explanation
for why you're deficient,

15:58.087 --> 15:59.610
I'd just like to run
a couple more tests.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.351
No, look, if I'm not sick,
I really got to get going.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.613
I've got, like,
1,000 planning calls to make.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.006
And not to mention,
I think there's people

16:04.006 --> 16:05.312
who need this bed
more than I do, so I think--

16:05.312 --> 16:06.704
- Samir--oh!
- Oh!

16:07.923 --> 16:09.272
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

16:09.272 --> 16:10.404
I'm not--
- Let's get back on the bed.

16:10.404 --> 16:14.364
- I'm fine.
- Both legs, please.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.368
Dr. Taylor?

16:20.457 --> 16:21.589
It's both legs.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.025
Do you know
how long you've had this?

16:23.025 --> 16:25.158
I don't know.
I thought it was a heat rash.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.076
This is not
from the anemia, is it?

16:30.076 --> 16:31.816
I don't know.

16:31.816 --> 16:32.948
Look, don't BS me.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.341
I know
what bad news looks like.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.821
What is it?

16:36.821 --> 16:39.563
These are petechiae,
a breakdown of red blood cells.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.391
It's usually associated
with a bleeding disorder.

16:41.391 --> 16:42.958
But it could be
any number of things.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.481
So what are we looking at?

16:44.481 --> 16:47.441
I mean, is it an autoimmune
disease or leukemia? What?

16:47.441 --> 16:49.051
We don't know until
we do further workup.

16:49.051 --> 16:52.663
Um, Maggie, let's get a lupus
panel, an ANA, and an X-ray.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.839
- Hmm.
- On it.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.058
Thank you.

16:59.844 --> 17:01.107
Maria.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.412
This is Dr. Marcel.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.284
Apologies for the wait,
Ms. Piscotta.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.068
You didn't tell me
the handsome doctor

17:06.068 --> 17:08.244
from the news was coming.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.290
I look a mess.
- No, please.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.727
Uh, apparently,
I'm addressing royalty.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.859
The doctor also tells me
you're the, uh, queen of pasta.

17:14.859 --> 17:18.037
Only woman in America who
can make the threads of God.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.081
Oh.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.300
It's all done by feel.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.171
You have to have the touch.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.999
Well, I look forward
to stopping by

17:23.999 --> 17:26.001
once we get you patched up.

17:26.001 --> 17:29.918
So your angiogram revealed an
injury to the brachial artery,

17:29.918 --> 17:33.095
a pseudoaneurysm
like, um, a balloon

17:33.095 --> 17:34.792
pushing out from the vessel.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.403
What does that mean?

17:36.403 --> 17:39.319
Well, unfortunately,
you'll need a surgical repair.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.756
But it'll remove
the risk of rupture

17:41.756 --> 17:43.540
while preserving healthy
blood flow to your arm.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.238
Now, Maria,
there are non-surgical

17:45.238 --> 17:46.804
options like stenting.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.241
It's less invasive.

17:48.241 --> 17:52.114
Let Dr. Handsome finish.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.421
Uh, my opinion,
surgery would offer

17:54.421 --> 17:56.423
the best long-term results.

17:56.423 --> 18:00.775
I know it seems like a lot,
but it's standard procedure.

18:00.775 --> 18:03.821
And if we did the repair today,
we can send you home tomorrow.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.823
And you will do the surgery?

18:05.823 --> 18:07.086
I would.

18:09.871 --> 18:13.004
If that's what you
think is best, andiamo.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.268
Okay. I'll make the call.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.144
You have a visitor.

18:22.144 --> 18:25.974
There's my boy.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.149
Sit.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.674
Hi.

18:30.674 --> 18:31.849
Ooh.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.810
Shh, shh, shh.

18:35.810 --> 18:39.030
Oh, no, Eddie, it's okay.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.772
It's okay. Come on. Don't cry.

18:41.772 --> 18:42.817
It's okay.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.691
Hmm.

18:47.691 --> 18:48.997
Please, Eddie, please.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.740
Okay.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.350
You see what I mean
about this cry?

18:54.350 --> 18:57.136
It's like a--it's like
a drill in my head.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.009
Okay.

19:01.009 --> 19:05.187
Stop, baby. Please, stop.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.536
Quiet, please.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.277
Penelope, take a deep breath.
You got this.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.670
You got this. You got this.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.846
I'm sorry.
Can you please take him out?

19:11.846 --> 19:14.196
I can't stand it.
- I've got it. I've got it.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.893
Shh, shh.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.463
It's okay. It's okay.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.162
Penelope?

19:25.294 --> 19:26.948
- What's happening?
- Penelope? Penelope?

19:26.948 --> 19:28.558
- What's happening to me?
- Okay.

19:28.558 --> 19:30.430
- Ah, help me.
- Okay, all right.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.171
Look at me. Look at me.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.346
- We got you.
- Look at me.

19:33.346 --> 19:34.738
Look at me. Look at me.

19:34.738 --> 19:35.913
Okay, can you smile?

19:35.913 --> 19:37.176
Try to smile.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.307
Okay.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.874
Trigger the stroke alert!

19:39.874 --> 19:40.918
Little help in here!

19:44.487 --> 19:46.359
We got you. We got you.
We got you.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.542
What the--hey, where's Maria?

19:55.542 --> 19:57.239
They just took her to pre-op.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.588
Look, I've been
thinking about it.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.024
We should hold off on surgery.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.243
I want to pitch her
the stent one more time.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.723
Come on, Will.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.159
We both know that's
not a long-term solution.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.205
No, but given her age
and her livelihood,

20:06.205 --> 20:07.989
we shouldn't be
so eager to flay her arm,

20:07.989 --> 20:09.904
risk nerve injury, put her
through extensive rehab.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.906
No, no. Her hands are her life.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.516
We cannot take that from her.

20:13.516 --> 20:16.911
All the more reason to stick
with a vascular repair.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.869
Deal with the pseudoaneurysm
with a stitch

20:18.869 --> 20:21.481
and keep her
off anti-platelets.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.309
And besides,
she's already consented.

20:23.309 --> 20:26.268
That's because
she saw you on TV.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.576
She's starstruck being treated
by the hotshot doctor

20:29.576 --> 20:31.534
from the news.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.328
Hey, you called me, remember?

20:42.328 --> 20:45.418
You don't think all that
influenced her decision?

20:45.418 --> 20:48.290
I don't know, but maybe your
connection with the patient

20:48.290 --> 20:49.726
is influencing yours.

20:53.774 --> 20:56.124
Hey, Will?

20:56.124 --> 21:00.259
I'm gonna take
good care of her, okay?

21:01.825 --> 21:03.479
Thank you.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.480
You got it.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.661
Hey, Dr. Asher?

21:11.661 --> 21:13.620
I think something
might be wrong?

21:13.620 --> 21:16.275
Okay.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.320
Hey, Caitlin.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.365
Are you in pain?

21:19.365 --> 21:21.454
Uh, it's--
it's not super bad,

21:21.454 --> 21:22.803
but, yeah, it hurts.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.152
Yeah, heart rate's
in the low hundreds.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.632
All right, I want to do
a quick ultrasound.

21:25.632 --> 21:26.981
Do you mind?
- Mm-hmm.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.983
Can you lift up, please?
- Sure.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.550
Here we go.
It's gonna be a little cold.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.203
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

21:33.857 --> 21:36.338
There we go.

21:36.338 --> 21:38.297
Okay, Caitlin, your
fallopian tube is ruptured,

21:38.297 --> 21:39.646
and there's blood
in your belly.

21:39.646 --> 21:40.821
Oh, my God.
Is she gonna be okay?

21:40.821 --> 21:43.171
Yes, but we need
to operate now.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.694
And I need to open
your abdomen.

21:44.694 --> 21:45.913
No, no, you said that
you could do it the other way.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.349
I can't be out of work.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.785
I understand, but we don't
have fiber optic cables.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.918
But we do have a camera
scope, so we're still able

21:50.918 --> 21:52.833
to operate laparoscopically,

21:52.833 --> 21:55.531
just in a different way,

21:55.531 --> 21:58.360
if you're good with that?

21:58.360 --> 22:02.016
Um, yeah, okay.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.234
Yes.

22:05.976 --> 22:07.674
Can you open
the hybrid OR, please?

22:07.674 --> 22:09.066
What do you think
you're doing?

22:09.066 --> 22:10.981
You jump in like that
without consulting me?

22:10.981 --> 22:12.896
I'm sorry, but we don't
have time for niceties.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.376
You said yourself
it was emergent,

22:14.376 --> 22:15.856
and this way,
we don't have to open her up.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.553
Oh, so now it's we?
This is my patient.

22:17.553 --> 22:18.989
This is her wish.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.469
Your way, she'd be in
for a lot more pain

22:20.469 --> 22:22.558
and a much longer recovery.

22:22.558 --> 22:23.951
Come on, you'll see.

22:23.951 --> 22:25.692
We'll make a good team.

22:25.692 --> 22:26.910
Come on.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.522
Okay.

22:29.522 --> 22:30.566
Clamps are off.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.046
Check the flow.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.534
Triphasic flow is good.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.100
Nice work.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.885
<i>You almost finished
in there?</i>

22:44.885 --> 22:47.235
Yeah. Just about to close.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.324
<i>Good, because
the lieutenant governor</i>

22:49.324 --> 22:51.848
<i>is here with cholecystitis,
and she's requested</i>

22:51.848 --> 22:54.242
<i>you perform the surgery.</i>

22:54.242 --> 22:55.374
Big time.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.897
Oh, hush.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.986
Okay, give me 30 minutes.
I'll be right there.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.336
<i>Come on.
It's the lieutenant governor.</i>

23:01.336 --> 23:03.860
<i>Dr. Tanaka-Reed can close.</i>

23:06.863 --> 23:09.126
- You good?
- Yes, sir. I got it.

23:09.126 --> 23:11.128
Minimum two layers
plus skin, all right?

23:11.128 --> 23:12.129
Mm-hmm.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.871
All right,
I'll be right there.

23:17.221 --> 23:20.094
Penelope's MRI
and CT are clean.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.052
Thank goodness,
that wasn't a stroke.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.837
Yeah. No tumors, either.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.360
Taken all together,
her symptoms add up

23:25.360 --> 23:27.144
to one thing.
- Bell's palsy.

23:27.144 --> 23:28.842
Tinnitus. Of course.

23:28.842 --> 23:32.280
Edison's cries must have
been excruciating.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.890
Yeah, it's why she's having
such a hard time

23:33.890 --> 23:35.675
when Eddie was acting up.

23:35.675 --> 23:38.112
And it's no wonder
she was at the end of her rope.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.983
On top of everything,
she was in pain

23:39.983 --> 23:41.855
and told it was
completely normal.

23:41.855 --> 23:44.292
How'd her OB miss this when she
complained about her symptoms?

23:44.292 --> 23:46.120
Well, unfortunately,
many women

23:46.120 --> 23:48.470
are failed by postpartum care.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.647
And in American medicine,
the mother is the wrapper;

23:51.647 --> 23:53.475
the baby, the candy.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.259
At least this case
has a happy ending.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.305
We can treat
Penelope's symptoms

23:57.305 --> 23:59.002
and reunite her with her baby.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.961
You know, I'd say this
is an important first step

24:00.961 --> 24:04.704
in her mental recovery,
but I don't know.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.140
We're not out of the woods yet.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.274
Samir's labs are in.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.494
No signs of autoimmune disease
or cancer.

24:12.494 --> 24:13.713
Small victories.

24:13.713 --> 24:15.410
But severe osteopenia?

24:15.410 --> 24:17.978
He has the bones
of a man twice his age.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.806
None of this makes any sense.

24:26.813 --> 24:27.944
What happened?

24:27.944 --> 24:29.206
I--I don't know.

24:30.686 --> 24:31.861
Oh.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.084
Where'd that
laceration come from?

24:37.084 --> 24:39.173
- Micro stitch?
- Uh, no.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.828
Grab me a heat cautery
and lidocaine 1%.

24:41.828 --> 24:42.916
- You got it.
- Uh, it's okay.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.308
Just slow breaths, okay?

24:44.308 --> 24:46.049
In through your nose.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.137
Out through your mouth.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.922
Yes. Good job. Good job.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.793
So what, did you cut yourself?

24:50.793 --> 24:52.534
No.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.623
Any injuries that
you forgot to tell me about?

24:54.623 --> 24:57.278
No, no, nothing.
What is happening to me?

24:57.278 --> 24:59.019
I don't know yet, but we're
gonna figure this out, okay?

24:59.019 --> 25:00.803
Just, um--just focus on me.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.548
Maggie, what does
this look like to you?

25:06.548 --> 25:07.984
An appendectomy scar.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.595
Yeah.

25:12.249 --> 25:14.121
We're gonna figure this out.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.431
A bulge on the
left fallopian.

25:20.431 --> 25:21.650
Let me see?

25:25.393 --> 25:27.874
That's the ectopic pregnancy.
- Yeah, that was clear to me.

25:27.874 --> 25:29.832
Okay, so grasp
the fallopian tubes.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.487
Put them on tension,

25:32.487 --> 25:35.142
and then take
your needlepoint cautery.

25:35.142 --> 25:37.187
Thank you.
Will you help me, please?

25:40.669 --> 25:42.758
You all right?

25:42.758 --> 25:43.977
I'm fine.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.282
Okay.

25:45.282 --> 25:47.589
Now, make a longitudinal
incision over the bulge.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.070
What?

25:52.986 --> 25:54.770
Step in.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.076
Step in?

25:56.076 --> 25:57.512
What--what are
you talking about?

25:57.512 --> 25:58.731
You're the only person here
who knows how

25:58.731 --> 26:00.036
to perform surgery this way.

26:00.036 --> 26:01.298
Well, you're about
to learn it now.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.430
If you knew you were in pain,

26:02.430 --> 26:04.040
you never should have
started this.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.302
I'm just respecting
your patient's needs.

26:05.302 --> 26:08.436
Now, stop it. Come on now.
Just take it. Go.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.153
It's not gonna magically
appear on the monitor.

26:30.153 --> 26:32.329
All right, just put your eye
back on the scope.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.679
Come on.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.821
This would go faster
if I could just open.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.649
You can do this, all right?

26:47.649 --> 26:49.520
Use your assistant, me.
I will guide you.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.522
I will help you.

27:02.316 --> 27:03.752
Come on.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.188
I can't get the angle.

27:05.188 --> 27:06.537
All right, so come in
through the other side.

27:06.537 --> 27:07.887
Just tell me where
the tube needs to be,

27:07.887 --> 27:09.279
and I will hold it.
- Okay, hold this.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.759
I got it.

27:10.759 --> 27:11.804
I'm going after the tube.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.196
Give me the ligature.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.423
All right. Got it?
There you go.

27:22.423 --> 27:23.946
Okay.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.132
Yeah.

27:37.568 --> 27:38.700
Okay.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.713
Got it.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.715
All right. Wrap this up.

27:58.111 --> 27:59.590
How's Samir?

27:59.590 --> 28:01.070
His wound looks good,
but he's understandably eager

28:01.070 --> 28:02.506
to find out
why his scar opened up.

28:02.506 --> 28:05.945
I have a hunch, but I
feel crazy even saying it.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.468
I want to run one more test.

28:07.468 --> 28:09.557
Okay.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.733
So fortunately,
with time and steroids,

28:11.733 --> 28:14.040
your Bell's palsy
should fully resolve.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.434
But what about
my terrible thoughts?

28:17.434 --> 28:19.132
Well, you know, there's
actually a name for those?

28:19.132 --> 28:21.090
They're called
intrusive thoughts.

28:21.090 --> 28:25.268
They're involuntary, violent,
often self-destructive.

28:25.268 --> 28:26.705
You ever been standing, say,

28:26.705 --> 28:28.184
on a balcony,
on a tall building,

28:28.184 --> 28:30.360
and you look over the edge,
and you go, oh,

28:30.360 --> 28:31.710
what would happen
if I jumped off?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.712
I mean, you don't do it,
but it's,

28:33.712 --> 28:36.584
uh--it's disturbing, right?

28:36.584 --> 28:38.064
I have friends with kids,
and none of them

28:38.064 --> 28:40.501
ever mentioned having
a thought like I did.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.024
Well, I mean,
it's not exactly

28:42.024 --> 28:43.896
the easiest thing to bring up.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.724
And it's a problem because
that means that people

28:45.724 --> 28:46.986
just don't talk about it.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.770
Don't you understand
that a good mother,

28:48.770 --> 28:51.033
regardless of Bell's palsy
or anything,

28:51.033 --> 28:53.775
would never think
of harming her own baby?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.821
No, y--you sought help.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.692
There's proof
you're a good mom.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.346
No!

28:59.346 --> 29:00.739
God, you have to understand.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.784
I could see myself
throwing him.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.874
This wasn't some fleeting,
vague idea.

29:05.874 --> 29:09.443
I actually thought about
him hitting the wall.

29:09.443 --> 29:11.358
It felt so horrifically real.

29:11.358 --> 29:13.142
This is not gonna be
my last stressful week,

29:13.142 --> 29:16.798
so I can never trust myself
with him.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.192
Look, we get it, okay? We do.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.237
We understand, and we're gonna
keep on working on this.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.673
As a matter of fact,
Dr. Choi and I

29:22.673 --> 29:25.589
are just gonna step outside
for a second, all right?

29:25.589 --> 29:27.809
Hey, we'll be right back.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.727
I get it.

29:32.727 --> 29:33.989
She's scared.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.774
But separating her
from her baby?

29:35.774 --> 29:38.254
They should be together.
- Oh, I completely agree.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.604
I mean, look, we can try
and normalize her fears

29:40.604 --> 29:41.910
until we're blue in the face,

29:41.910 --> 29:43.129
but I think she needs
to hear about it

29:43.129 --> 29:46.262
from a different kind
of expert.

29:46.262 --> 29:48.482
There aren't many reasons
a surgical scar can reopen,

29:48.482 --> 29:50.789
especially an older one
like an appendectomy.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.487
So on a hunch,
I ran one more blood test.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.445
So have you figured out
what's happening to me?

29:55.445 --> 29:57.273
Hypovitaminosis C.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.493
Better known as scurvy.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.016
You've got to be joking.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.932
Like old timey, sailor scurvy?
People still get that?

30:03.932 --> 30:06.761
It's rare, but you mentioned
having a limited diet.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.850
Peanut butter, protein bars,
coffee--

30:08.850 --> 30:10.286
they all lack vitamin C.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.332
And without that,
your body can't maintain

30:12.332 --> 30:14.377
the collagen,
the connective tissue,

30:14.377 --> 30:15.857
it needs in order to function.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.293
Which would explain
your low bone density

30:17.293 --> 30:18.338
and your petechiae.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.774
But this is all
treatable, right?

30:19.774 --> 30:21.123
I mean, what, eat a
couple slices of oranges,

30:21.123 --> 30:22.951
and I'll be fine?
- Pretty much.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.474
We're gonna set you up
on an infusion.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.433
And then after that,
we'll get you on an oral,

30:26.433 --> 30:27.869
high-dose multivitamin.

30:27.869 --> 30:31.307
You should start feeling
better in about 48 hours.

30:34.223 --> 30:37.096
You know, I have been in some
hairy situations in my career,

30:37.096 --> 30:40.882
but this scared
the crap out of me.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.971
And you were so calm.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.408
Like I said,
got to help the helpers.

30:48.759 --> 30:49.978
Dr. Taylor?

30:53.025 --> 30:55.549
Could I trouble you
for another moment?

30:55.549 --> 30:56.855
Yeah, sure.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.899
I'll get the pharmacy
to start

30:57.899 --> 30:59.292
working on your infusion.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.863
Lieutenant governor
did great.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.125
- Oh.
- Surgery went perfectly.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.387
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

31:07.387 --> 31:08.910
I'll let her
chief of staff know

31:08.910 --> 31:10.912
he can release the statement.
- Okay.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.914
Hey, nice having Gaffney
and you name-dropped

31:12.914 --> 31:14.437
by the people in Springfield.

31:14.437 --> 31:15.656
Oh, well, that's cool.

31:15.656 --> 31:16.918
Hmm.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.354
Uh, excuse me.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.399
Yeah.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.188
- Where you been?
- What happened?

31:26.188 --> 31:29.235
- Arm's cold and dusky.
- Doppler.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.632
No blood flow
below the repair.

31:35.632 --> 31:36.764
Must have thrombosed.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.722
- How?
- This soon after surgery?

31:38.722 --> 31:39.767
It's got to be
a technical error.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.029
No way the repair went down.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.378
It was in good shape
when you scrubbed out.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.076
You left the OR before
the surgery was finished?

31:44.076 --> 31:45.555
No. Repair was complete.

31:45.555 --> 31:47.035
Clearly, it wasn't.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.819
You should have been there.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.038
She should have been
your priority.

31:50.038 --> 31:51.474
We got to get her back
into the OR.

31:51.474 --> 31:52.562
Kai, let's go. Come on.

31:52.562 --> 31:53.824
Excuse me.

31:56.218 --> 31:57.350
Let's go.

31:59.569 --> 32:00.788
Easy, easy!

32:07.969 --> 32:09.710
Penelope?

32:09.710 --> 32:11.538
May I come in?

32:11.538 --> 32:13.888
How's Edison? Is he okay?

32:13.888 --> 32:15.585
Oh, he's wonderful,
has the nurses

32:15.585 --> 32:18.153
all wrapped around
his little fingers.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.766
I could bring him in,
if you'd like.

32:24.812 --> 32:27.162
You're worried
about your thoughts.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.903
How could I not be?

32:28.903 --> 32:31.601
No one seems to understand
how real it felt.

32:32.863 --> 32:33.821
May I?

32:38.957 --> 32:41.742
Oh, look at that.

32:41.742 --> 32:44.092
He's so cute.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.398
And he's perfect.

32:45.398 --> 32:46.965
You know that, right?

32:49.358 --> 32:50.620
Do you have kids?

32:50.620 --> 32:51.708
I do.

32:51.708 --> 32:55.712
Two boys and a girl, all grown.

32:55.712 --> 32:58.454
Tara was about Edison's age.

32:58.454 --> 33:01.066
She had the worst colic--

33:01.066 --> 33:05.679
I mean, screaming for hours.

33:05.679 --> 33:09.248
Sleeping longer than an hour
felt like a vacation.

33:09.248 --> 33:15.254
One morning about 3:00 a.m.,
I had been pacing the hallway,

33:15.254 --> 33:16.995
trying to soothe her.

33:16.995 --> 33:22.217
My baby was suffering,
and I couldn't fix it.

33:22.217 --> 33:26.004
And I was bone tired.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.788
I felt alone.

33:27.788 --> 33:30.312
I felt like I was the only
person awake in the world.

33:30.312 --> 33:33.533
And I just

33:33.533 --> 33:38.581
was desperate for quiet.

33:38.581 --> 33:41.889
And out of nowhere,

33:41.889 --> 33:46.067
I had this thought
to just toss her out

33:46.067 --> 33:47.677
of the second-floor window.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.902
It really frightened me,

33:54.902 --> 34:00.081
and I questioned whether
I could be a good parent.

34:00.081 --> 34:03.041
And when I finally
worked up the courage

34:03.041 --> 34:05.304
to mention it to a friend

34:05.304 --> 34:10.135
who I thought
was like super mother...

34:10.135 --> 34:11.962
Mm.

34:11.962 --> 34:15.227
I was stunned when she
told me she had had

34:15.227 --> 34:18.708
similar thoughts
with her babies.

34:18.708 --> 34:22.495
And when I went to see
the pediatrician,

34:22.495 --> 34:27.369
he reassured me
that it was normal.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.114
All anyone ever talks about

34:33.114 --> 34:36.987
is the joy and the love
and the happiness, and...

34:39.294 --> 34:40.643
I felt all that too.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.124
But listen, have you
ever really listened

34:43.124 --> 34:45.170
to the lyrics of a lullaby?

34:45.170 --> 34:49.130
Singing about dropping cradles
from treetops

34:49.130 --> 34:53.439
and feeding crying babies
to crabs and monsters?

34:55.223 --> 34:59.619
But it's proof that parenthood
throughout time

34:59.619 --> 35:03.144
and the world over is hard.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.842
And it is also true

35:05.842 --> 35:09.368
that it takes a village
to raise a child.

35:09.368 --> 35:12.545
And there are mother groups

35:12.545 --> 35:16.897
that have great resources
for making friends,

35:16.897 --> 35:22.468
finding support,
asking questions.

35:22.468 --> 35:25.645
I can connect you
with one, if you'd like.

35:27.951 --> 35:29.170
I'd love that.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.522
And here.

35:33.522 --> 35:36.786
You listen to me, Penelope.

35:36.786 --> 35:39.746
You did not have
an easy start...

35:41.400 --> 35:45.447
But I have no concerns
about you.

35:45.447 --> 35:46.579
You hear me?

35:46.579 --> 35:52.976
Edison is a lucky, lucky boy.

35:52.976 --> 35:54.239
Thanks.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.110
Uh-huh.

35:56.110 --> 35:59.766
Maybe you'd like
to see him after all?

35:59.766 --> 36:01.420
Yes, please.

36:01.420 --> 36:02.638
Okay.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.470
Bring him in.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.130
Hi, sweet boy.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.958
Oh.

36:17.958 --> 36:20.352
Thank you.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.571
Hi. Mama is here.

36:22.571 --> 36:24.312
Mama's here.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.061
It was something
we call a vasospasm,

36:34.061 --> 36:36.368
random constriction
of the blood vessel,

36:36.368 --> 36:37.978
totally unrelated
to the surgery.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.198
That said, your repair
was in good shape.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.504
This old bird
still got her wing.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.114
She sure does.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.639
But, uh, maybe just take
it easy on the pasta roller

36:46.639 --> 36:48.162
while you heal up, okay?

36:48.162 --> 36:50.295
We need to get your picture
on our famosi wall.

36:50.295 --> 36:53.080
Getting to eat your pasta's
reward enough.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.560
Ah, Guglielmo.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.302
Thank you for getting
Dr. Handsome to help me.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.477
You bring him with you,

36:58.477 --> 37:00.914
I'll make you two
squid ink pasta.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.307
Wow.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.873
She swore she'd only ever
make that for the Pope.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.048
Oh.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.180
<i>Grazie.</i>

37:06.180 --> 37:07.921
<i>Grazie mille.</i>

37:09.488 --> 37:11.533
You got it.

37:11.533 --> 37:12.969
I'm gonna let you
get some rest.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.188
Okay.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.237
Thanks.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.674
Hey, Will, look,
about the surgery, I, uh--

37:21.674 --> 37:23.328
It wasn't your fault.
I was out of line.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.199
No, you had a point.

37:25.199 --> 37:28.333
I got wrapped up
in all the attention.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.031
Okay, that's true.

37:31.031 --> 37:33.642
You're a good surgeon, Crockett.

37:33.642 --> 37:36.732
Just not sure you deserve
her squid ink pasta.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.214
Touché.

37:43.826 --> 37:45.872
So while the bleeding
necessitated our removal

37:45.872 --> 37:48.657
of your fallopian tube,
this will not prevent you

37:48.657 --> 37:50.877
from becoming pregnant
again and carrying

37:50.877 --> 37:52.661
a healthy baby to term.

37:52.661 --> 37:54.359
Thank you, Dr. Asher.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.970
Thank you both.

37:56.970 --> 37:59.320
Hannah and Dean--
good baby names.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.669
We'll have to remember that.

38:00.669 --> 38:01.975
Actually, I never liked Dean.

38:01.975 --> 38:02.976
I think you can do better.

38:02.976 --> 38:05.065
Oh, yeah?

38:05.065 --> 38:06.414
Okay, we'll get you
a diet ordered,

38:06.414 --> 38:08.938
and if you do okay,
we'll send you home tonight.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.940
- Thank you.
- Sure.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.163
Hey, I wanted to say thank you.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.339
I'm relieved we could
respect Caitlin's wishes,

38:18.339 --> 38:20.254
and I'm lucky I had your help.

38:20.254 --> 38:21.647
Well, you did good
for a mere mortal.

38:21.647 --> 38:23.518
Hey, Dean?

38:23.518 --> 38:24.867
Yeah?

38:24.867 --> 38:27.130
In the OR, you were in pain.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.527
Oh, please.

38:32.527 --> 38:33.920
It's a--it's a--

38:33.920 --> 38:35.617
it's a hard angle to hold

38:35.617 --> 38:37.402
when your ribs
are still healing.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.881
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.753
Don't kid a kidder.

38:40.753 --> 38:43.103
Look, you don't want my help,
that's fine,

38:43.103 --> 38:45.671
but you have to let
somebody check you out.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.805
Hey, I'm fine, Dr. Asher.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.199
Yeah.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.811
- Okay.
- All right.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.669
What's this?

39:27.669 --> 39:29.279
Recommended
travel vaccinations.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.499
I thought you could give me
a hand scheduling them.

39:31.499 --> 39:34.023
I didn't know
you were going on vacation.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.984
Samir offered me
a spot on his team.

39:37.984 --> 39:40.943
He thought I'd be a great fit.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.468
In the Philippines?

39:43.468 --> 39:44.904
I said yes.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.429
Wait, wait.
You can't just up and leave.

39:48.429 --> 39:49.822
What about your residency?

39:49.822 --> 39:51.998
I'll talk to my program
director and Ms. Goodwin.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.479
I'll defer finishing for now,
but they'll understand.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.655
But I don't.

39:56.655 --> 39:57.830
Where's this coming from?

39:57.830 --> 40:00.049
From me, Maggie.

40:01.529 --> 40:04.445
Listen, you--you were upset,
and rightly so,

40:04.445 --> 40:07.492
when I bought those drugs
off the street.

40:07.492 --> 40:09.798
But what I didn't say
to you earlier that

40:09.798 --> 40:12.453
I should have is that I was--

40:12.453 --> 40:15.064
I was actually inspired.

40:15.064 --> 40:17.893
I mean, despite the risk,
I helped my patient.

40:17.893 --> 40:21.201
I was resourceful.
I mean, I was a good doctor.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.421
That's the kind of person
that I want to be.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.512
And you can't be
that person here?

40:27.512 --> 40:28.991
Maybe.

40:28.991 --> 40:32.212
But I know that this
opportunity will allow me

40:32.212 --> 40:34.736
to be the kind of doctor
that I want to be,

40:34.736 --> 40:35.998
doing the work that I love.

40:35.998 --> 40:40.525
I--this is my calling.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.788
Why don't you just take
some time and think about it?

40:42.788 --> 40:44.616
- I don't want to.
- But--

40:44.616 --> 40:48.010
I just want to close my eyes
and take the leap.

40:57.542 --> 40:58.804
Okay.
