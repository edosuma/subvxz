00:11.800 --> 00:13.200
Andy, hi.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.800
I was nowhere near the neighbourhood,
thought I'd stop by.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.100
Honest man. I like that.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.300
So...

00:23.900 --> 00:28.200
...I had a great time last night.
- Yeah, me too.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.900
But I forgot to give you something
very important. Happy birthday.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.100
- But it's not my birthday till next week.
- Consider this a preview.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.700
- A key?
- To the Calistoga Spa.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.700
We leave Friday night after work.

00:47.100 --> 00:50.300
- Don't worry, I got us adjoining rooms.
- Adjoining rooms?

00:50.500 --> 00:53.700
I wouldn't want to assume something
I'm not supposed to be assuming.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.900
Although, it has been
over a month since we...

00:57.000 --> 00:59.100
Then decided to take it slow.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.800
But no pressure.
I just want to be with you, away.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.600
Together.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.100
- Think about it.
- Okay.

01:16.300 --> 01:19.400
Let me know. Bye.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.400
Happy birthday to me.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.200
Give me a break, Mom.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.900
You're like the Chinese
Shirley MacLaine, you know?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.800
- I'll risk it.
- You should have more respect

01:41.000 --> 01:43.100
for Ghost Month.
If your grandmother were here...

01:43.300 --> 01:45.600
She'd warn me about all the
evil spirits walking the streets

01:45.800 --> 01:47.200
of Chinatown, I know. I know.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.000
You should take this.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.400
For protection.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.500
Maybe the ghosts
need protection from me.

02:03.800 --> 02:08.000
I'll be okay, Mom. I'm 23 now.
I can take care of myself, okay?

02:08.100 --> 02:10.600
- I gotta go.
- Happy birthday, Mark.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.600
Thanks.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.400
- Hi, Mark.
- Hey, how are you?

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:41.100 --> 02:43.800
- This the guy?
- That's him.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.300
- Today your birthday?
- Who are you? What do you want?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.400
You. Make a wish.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.800
Perfect fit.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.100
Come on, now, douse him.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200
Come on. Hurry up.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.400
What are you doing?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.500
Hey, wait. No!

03:33.700 --> 03:37.200
Let's get out of here.
Let's go. Come on.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.200
Good morning.
What are you doing?

05:15.400 --> 05:17.200
Prue's coming down,
put those away.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.800
Phoebe, you were supposed to send
these invitations last week.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.800
- The party is Friday.
- We're right on schedule.

05:22.900 --> 05:26.700
The restaurant's reserved, the menu's
selected, the cake has been ordered.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.000
That's because I did all those things.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.900
At least tell me you've managed
to buy Prue something

05:32.100 --> 05:34.000
other than your
traditional birthday gift.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.900
- What's my traditional gift?
- A card, three days late.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.800
Yeah, well, I decided to break
that tradition and start a new one.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
You bought Prue a gift?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.000
Where did you get
the money to pay for it?

05:46.700 --> 05:48.700
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.400
Hey, I forgot to ask,
how was your date with Andy?

05:51.600 --> 05:55.600
Great. Until he asked me to
spend my birthday at a spa with him.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.300
- Oh, I hate it when they do that.
- For this weekend?

05:58.500 --> 06:02.000
- You didn't say yes, did you?
- My body did, screamed it actually.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.800
But I don't know.
I have to think about it.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.500
A weekend of rest, rubdowns and
room service, what's to think about?

06:09.200 --> 06:11.600
I mean, you could be right.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.300
Going away with a guy is like...

06:14.500 --> 06:17.200
It's like bringing them home to meet
the parents. Changes everything.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.400
And if you're not sure if you're ready to
make a commitment or not, you know,

06:20.600 --> 06:22.700
you don't wanna send
the wrong signal.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.400
You need a week to prepare
for a weekend away.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.600
I mean, there's lingerie shopping,
waxing, manicure, pedicure.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.700
I mean, it's basically a full-time job,
and you've already got one.

06:30.900 --> 06:34.400
So you'll never be ready. Not even
if you started packing this second.

06:35.500 --> 06:39.900
Bottom line. Unless you're ready
to put your toothbrush next to his,

06:40.100 --> 06:41.300
you shouldn't go.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.300
You guys aren't trying to plan
another surprise party for me, are you?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.100
No, never.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.900
No, we've given up on
trying to surprise you, Prue.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.400
Well, that's good, because you
both know how much I hate surprises.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.200
Damn it, Phoebe.
If you had sent Andy his invitation,

06:56.400 --> 06:57.600
we wouldn't be in this mess.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.800
Okay, what are you talking about?
You heard Prue,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.600
she doesn't want a party.
You should be glad that I flaked.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.700
Besides, you know as well as I do
she's gonna go away with Andy.

07:06.900 --> 07:11.800
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a present to pay for.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.200
Which means I have a job interview.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.000
No other hotel does psychic readings
at the bar, it's kind of our trademark.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.000
Well, that's why I'm here.
I saw your ad in the <i>Chronicle</i>.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.000
- I am a natural-born psychic.
- Yeah, right.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.500
So, what's your act? Tea leaves,
tarot cards, crystal balls, what?

07:32.700 --> 07:35.500
No, I can see the future.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.900
I mean, I can't always see it. I never
actually know when it's gonna work.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.700
Usually, when I touch someone,

07:40.900 --> 07:43.200
or I'm in the same general area
as them.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.800
It's kind of hard to explain.

07:45.500 --> 07:50.900
- Next.
- No, wait! Frankie, hold it. I see it.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.000
You're having dinner
with a blond woman.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.400
She's gorgeous, all over you.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.900
Then some redhead shows up.
You look surprised.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.600
She looks pissed. Your wife?

08:09.400 --> 08:11.200
When can you start?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.300
<i>So have you made your</i>
<i>mind up about Calistoga?</i>

08:15.400 --> 08:17.200
I don't know.
I keep thinking it's a bad idea,

08:17.400 --> 08:20.300
then I think, what's the big deal?
It's not like we haven't slept together.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.200
I think you should go. On Saturday.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.800
On Saturday, why?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.400
Piper, you promised.
No surprise party.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.900
It's not what you think. It's Phoebe.
She bought you a present.

08:31.100 --> 08:34.100
Phoebe doesn't give presents,
she gives cards, three days late.

08:34.299 --> 08:36.200
Not this year. Surprise.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.100
<i>And she really wants to</i>
<i>give it to you Friday,</i>

08:38.299 --> 08:41.200
<i>so could you please just ask Andy</i>
<i>about leaving on Saturday instead?</i>

08:41.400 --> 08:45.000
You have no idea how much Phoebe
has put herself through. She even...

08:45.600 --> 08:48.300
She even got a job and everything.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
<i>Okay, I'll ask. If I decide to go.</i>

08:50.600 --> 08:55.400
- So, what kind of job did Phoebe get?
- Don't know. Gotta go. <i>Ciao</i>.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.500
You're in a large room,
with lots of other people.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.900
- With lots of other women.
- Go on.

09:12.500 --> 09:17.800
You're standing at a podium.
No, wait, you're on a scale.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.800
It's a Weight Watchers meeting.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.800
Honey, it looks like
you've gained some weight.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.400
That's impossible.
I only cheated once this week.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.600
No, no, I'm not judging.
I'm just seeing.

09:32.700 --> 09:36.300
You're a fraud, that's what you are.
I've never been so insulted in my life.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.000
- I want my $20 back.
- No way. I saw you.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.800
You know I saw you.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.700
Hey, you want me to lie next time?
Just say so.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.800
- Phoebe.
- Piper.

09:49.300 --> 09:52.000
I am so busted, aren't I?

09:52.200 --> 09:57.100
- Are you out of your mind again?
- No, I'm the Amazing Phoebe.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.500
This is not funny. Our powers
are supposed to be a secret,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.000
not a marketable job skill.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.500
Relax, they didn't hire me
because they think I'm a witch,

10:03.600 --> 10:05.400
they hired me
because they think I'm a psychic.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.300
Hairsplitting. You know you can't
use your powers for personal gain.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.600
- Not without consequences.
- No, but it's for Prue. It's not for me.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.400
It's to pay for her present.
It's completely selfless.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.000
Besides, this is the last place

10:17.100 --> 10:19.800
anyone would expect to find
a real psychic, believe me.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.300
Which one of you is the psychic?

10:21.500 --> 10:23.200
- She is.
- Oh, I am.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.500
You can see me? Both of you?

10:26.100 --> 10:28.500
Of course we can see you.
Now back off.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.600
Thank God. I've tried communicating
with every psychic in the city.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.100
You were my last chance.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.000
Phoebe, what are you doing?
We got customers waiting.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.900
Okay, listen to me, you're the
only ones who can help me.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.500
Excuse us? We're trying
to have an argument here.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.100
Who are you?

10:48.200 --> 10:50.900
She's just leaving.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.300
Bye. Go. Now.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.000
- Wait a minute. I need your help.
- Yeah? Talk to the psychic.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.400
Please, I'm begging you. I was
murdered last night, I can prove it.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.200
Stop harassing me, buddy.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.400
Please, I'm desperate.
You gotta help me.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.900
Leave me alone or I'll call the police.
Can you believe this guy?

11:09.100 --> 11:12.400
All you have to do is come with me
to Chinatown and see for yourself.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.500
All right, that's it.
Look, either back off or...

11:14.700 --> 11:15.900
Look out!

11:22.300 --> 11:24.200
Now do you believe me?

11:24.800 --> 11:28.500
Oh, my God.
I can see you, but no one else can?

11:28.700 --> 11:30.600
I'm dead. I'm a ghost.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.200
Would you like another one?

11:46.200 --> 11:47.400
So she goes, "Okay."

11:47.600 --> 11:49.500
So he leans over
and gives her a kiss.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.600
- Right on the cheek...
- Hi.

11:51.800 --> 11:52.800
Prue.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.600
I tried calling the station house for you.
They said that you'd probably be here.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.200
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:59.800 --> 12:04.600
- Oh, Prue, this is...
- Susan Trudeau. Nice to meet you.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.700
- Pleasure.
- Trudeau?

12:06.900 --> 12:08.800
- Sister?
- No, actually...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Wife.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.500
Ex-wife.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.900
- Prue, wait, I can explain.
- Don't bother.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.600
It's not what you think.
We divorced over...

12:25.500 --> 12:26.600
Thanks for helping me.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.000
When you wouldn't leave my doorstep,
you didn't leave me much of a choice.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.300
- Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
- Please, I don't have much time.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.800
Somebody has to find my body
before it's too late.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.300
Too late for what?

12:38.900 --> 12:42.700
It's a Chinese myth, or at least
I always thought it was a myth.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.000
It's called <i>Da Jui.</i>
When the gates of hell open.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.900
- We're almost there.
- The gates of hell? I don't understand.

12:49.100 --> 12:53.100
If the gatekeeper, Yama, captures my
soul before my body's properly buried,

12:53.300 --> 12:55.000
he'll take me to hell. Forever.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.700
But you said you were murdered.
How can...?

12:56.900 --> 13:01.300
Yama doesn't care about good or evil.
He just wants souls.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.800
I should've listened to my mother.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.500
Is that you?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.900
- Yama.
- Yama?

13:19.500 --> 13:23.500
- Run.
- It's too late. You'd better go. Run!

13:27.700 --> 13:30.800
- What happened?
- I'm a good witch, remember?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.300
- But how?
- I don't know.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.800
I panic, I put up both hands,
and bad things tend to freeze.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
- For how long?
- Not very. Let's go.

14:05.100 --> 14:08.300
Prue, you can't do this.
Piper's gonna be crushed.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.200
- I'm gonna be crushed?
- The surprise party is off.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.900
- What party?
- She's onto us.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.600
The restaurant called
while we were out.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.300
Is that why you were
so upset earlier?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.200
Let's just say
it hasn't been a great day.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.700
Does it have anything to do with
why Andy's been calling all night?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.700
Piper, where did you say
today's paper was?

14:25.800 --> 14:27.700
Hey, I'm practically naked here.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.400
Sorry.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.200
What's the drunk
from the hotel doing here?

14:31.300 --> 14:34.300
- The name's Mark. I'm not a drunk.
- He's a ghost.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.600
- Excuse me? A what?
- A ghost.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.900
He was murdered,
and he obviously needs our help.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.700
Why else would we
be able to see him?

14:40.900 --> 14:43.200
- Well, he can see us, that's for sure.
- Hey!

14:43.500 --> 14:47.600
- Of all the days to be a dead man.
- You sure this guy's really a ghost?

14:50.500 --> 14:51.500
Positive.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.300
So how do we know that the guy
doesn't really belong in hell?

14:57.500 --> 15:01.000
Because we can see him. He's one
of the innocent we have to protect.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.200
Protect from what? He's dead.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.300
All we have to do is get Mark's family
to give him a proper burial,

15:06.400 --> 15:10.500
and then he can move on
to wherever it is he moves on to.

15:10.600 --> 15:14.000
Okay, so call the police
and let them know where the body is.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.600
I already did. I just wanna give them
a little time to notify Mark's mom

15:17.800 --> 15:21.100
- before I go and I talk to her.
- Talk to her? And tell her what?

15:21.300 --> 15:23.800
That you're a witch in touch
with the ghost of her dead son?

15:23.900 --> 15:26.200
No, I'm just gonna try
and get her to have a funeral

15:26.400 --> 15:30.200
as soon as possible,
before Yama gets Mark's spirit.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.100
Hello?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.600
Hi, I can't really talk right now.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.100
It's important?
Okay, I'll be at the hotel in a little while.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.400
All right, bye. That was my
new boss calling, I gotta run.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.900
Okay, so when you called the police,
you didn't talk to Andy, did you?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
No, it was anonymous.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.300
Why, did you decide
to not to go away with him?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.300
Actually, I decided to go.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.400
Until I went to tell him and found him
having dinner with his ex-wife.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.300
- His what?
- Yeah. I mean,

16:04.400 --> 16:07.000
you'd think that
he would have remembered

16:07.200 --> 16:10.500
to reveal that little fact
before we jumped in the sack.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.600
Well, what did he say?
Why didn't he tell you?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.400
I don't know. I didn't hang around
long enough to ask.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.000
How's it going in there?

16:20.300 --> 16:21.800
Sorry.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.100
You know?

16:24.200 --> 16:26.400
Don't these guys knock?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.800
The guy's staying in the grand suite.
Could be a sultan, I'm not sure.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.300
Anyway, that's why I called.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.000
Let's make this bozo's night.
Read his future.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.700
Tell him something good
and he'll extend his stay, guaranteed.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.300
Look, like I said, I don't always know
when my psychic switch

16:41.500 --> 16:42.700
is gonna be in the up position.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.200
Look, I have the utmost confidence
in you, Phoebe, baby.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.000
I don't know how you do it,
but keep it up

16:47.200 --> 16:48.800
and you'll always have work here.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.900
Excuse me, sir! You forgot you're...

17:18.800 --> 17:21.500
You okay? What's the matter?

17:22.200 --> 17:24.400
Nothing. I...

17:25.900 --> 17:27.599
Nothing.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.500
Still new to me.
I keep forgetting I'm...

17:54.800 --> 17:58.000
- Those for me?
- Yeah. Stupid question:

17:58.100 --> 18:01.200
- Do ghosts sleep?
- I don't even get cold anymore.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.400
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.100
It's the thought that counts.

18:06.300 --> 18:10.700
I guess it's finally sinking in.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.300
What's really happened.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.800
What I've lost.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.800
No more sucking down a bucket
of oysters at the Wharf.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.800
Playing pickup ball with friends.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.800
Coming home and hearing
my mother's voice on the machine,

18:25.900 --> 18:29.800
nagging because I haven't
married a nice Chinese girl.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.400
Your mom means a lot to you, huh?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.400
She's a great friend.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.300
Was.

18:45.300 --> 18:49.100
It was just me and her
after my father died.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.300
Taught me everything I know.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.800
Especially how to cook.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.200
- Mom's a great cook.
- My Grams taught me how to cook.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.600
- I loved it so much I became a chef.
- Really?

19:00.800 --> 19:04.000
- Ever make a Peking duck?
- No. You?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.400
It's a piece of cake.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.800
Mom told me
I could've been a great chef,

19:07.900 --> 19:11.500
if I hadn't sold out to the
molecular biology program at Stanford.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.600
So you can make Peking duck
and clone DNA.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.800
The duck's harder.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.700
Well, I can talk about food
all night long.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.600
Yeah? Well, I can
talk about it forever.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.400
Oh, Mr Correy, thank goodness.
I need to talk to you.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.900
- You do? Me?
- Yeah.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.400
- Hey, you're that psychic, right?
- Yeah, right. Look...

19:42.500 --> 19:45.600
- Is that how you knew my name?
- No. Yes.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.000
Did you get the note
that I left for you?

19:48.200 --> 19:51.000
That note warning me
not to go outside? That was you?

19:51.700 --> 19:54.000
You get your jollies
out of trying to scare people?

19:54.200 --> 19:55.800
Or is that how
you drum up business?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
What? You don't understand...

19:58.100 --> 20:00.300
Honey, where do you
want to eat break...?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.100
- Hi.
- What's she doing here?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.200
- She sent the note.
- It's not what you think.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.000
Look here.
When I picked up your wallet...

20:07.200 --> 20:10.400
- You stole my wallet?
- I didn't steal your wallet.

20:10.600 --> 20:14.700
I don't know what you want, but just
stay away from us, you understand?

20:15.200 --> 20:17.200
But he's going to die.

20:18.700 --> 20:22.300
That didn't come out right.
Look, I can't tell you how I know this,

20:22.500 --> 20:27.500
but I swear, if you go outside,
you're gonna get run over by a pink...

20:28.000 --> 20:30.700
Wait, you don't have your briefcase.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.900
That's good, that's really good. It
doesn't happen without your briefcase.

20:34.100 --> 20:38.100
You leave us alone,
or I'm gonna call hotel security.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.400
Hi.

21:00.600 --> 21:03.100
You of all people should know
that bribery is a crime.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.700
Apologizing isn't, is it?

21:06.600 --> 21:09.600
Look, Prue, I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was married before. I should have.

21:09.700 --> 21:13.300
- I was going to.
- Really? When?

21:13.900 --> 21:16.000
Before or after the door
to our adjoining rooms

21:16.200 --> 21:19.000
- swung open this weekend?
- Okay, I deserve that.

21:19.100 --> 21:22.100
I don't understand how you
couldn't have found the time to tell me.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.200
Unless you really were
trying to hide it from me.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.100
Come on, Prue,
you know me better than that.

21:26.300 --> 21:29.200
- Do I?
- It was an innocent dinner, that's all.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.800
I've got an ex-wife and I don't
hate her, is that so horrible?

21:31.900 --> 21:34.300
No. No, it's not.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.900
But not being honest
and telling me up front is.

21:38.100 --> 21:41.100
Which I've already apologized for.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.800
Why are you trying to turn this
into something it's not?

21:48.800 --> 21:51.000
What's really bugging you, Prue?

21:53.800 --> 21:56.800
Looks like I'm not the only one
trying to hide a secret.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.000
Are you sure this is going to work?

22:08.200 --> 22:10.500
If you speak her language,
she'll trust you.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.200
Can I help you?

22:33.500 --> 22:35.100
She asked if you know where I am.

22:35.800 --> 22:40.000
- Wait, you don't?
- No. And I'm worried sick.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.200
I haven't heard from him
since his birthday.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.300
- The police haven't notified her yet?
- How's that possible?

22:47.700 --> 22:52.500
- I mean, that he hasn't called yet?
- I don't know, it's not like him.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.900
When did you last see him?

22:56.600 --> 22:58.100
Well...

22:58.300 --> 23:00.800
Piper, you have to tell her.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.300
You have to tell her where
my body is so she can bury me.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.300
I can't.

23:06.500 --> 23:10.000
I can't remember
the last time, actually.

23:10.100 --> 23:13.300
But if I see him or hear from him,
I'll let you know.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.700
Thank you. Thank you.

23:15.900 --> 23:18.500
You can't walk away, Piper.
You have to tell her.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.400
Mom. No!

23:23.200 --> 23:25.100
- What happened?
- She's got the house protected

23:25.300 --> 23:26.400
against ghosts.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.300
All the Chinese fairy tales
she told me growing up are true.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.500
And I'm gonna burn in hell.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.900
- Man trouble?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.600
By the way,
where were you last night?

23:45.800 --> 23:49.200
- Something wrong?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.300
Okay.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.300
You never clean, and you'll talk
about anything. What's up?

23:59.500 --> 24:01.200
Nothing.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.500
Phoebe.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.100
Okay, I had a premonition.
A really bad one too.

24:08.300 --> 24:11.500
I saw a guy getting run over
by a pink Cadillac.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.500
- Pink Cadillac?
- I know it sounds ridiculous,

24:14.600 --> 24:18.200
but it's true. I saw it,
and I don't know what to do about it.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.500
Did you warn him?

24:19.700 --> 24:21.900
Yeah, I tried.
He thought I was out of my mind.

24:22.100 --> 24:24.200
Thought I was stalking him
or something.

24:24.500 --> 24:27.800
How do you tell a complete stranger
that you know they're gonna die?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.400
Where is he now?

24:30.700 --> 24:33.000
The Hotel Neptune.

24:33.300 --> 24:37.300
- And what were you doing there?
- I knew you were gonna ask that.

24:37.500 --> 24:40.100
I wanted to get you
a really great birthday present

24:40.300 --> 24:42.600
to make up for all those cards.

24:42.800 --> 24:47.000
So I got a job at the hotel
as their lounge psychic.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.600
Go ahead, yell at me.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.600
Phoebe, you have to save him.
You can't let him out of your sight.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.700
Don't worry,
I waited until he went to sleep,

24:54.900 --> 24:57.200
and then I broke a key off
in his door to lock him in.

24:57.300 --> 24:59.400
He's safe till morning.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.300
Hey, wait. That's it?

25:04.500 --> 25:05.700
You're not gonna get mad at me?

25:06.700 --> 25:09.100
You were trying to do
something good.

25:09.400 --> 25:13.300
And now you're gonna get to do
something wonderful.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.000
I couldn't ask for a better
birthday present than that.

25:19.700 --> 25:22.900
- You guys have to see this.
- They found my body.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.800
<i>Although police reported that the body</i>
<i>was burned beyond recognition...</i>

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
It's finally over.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.900
<i>... personal effects found at the scene</i>
<i>preliminarily identify him</i>

25:30.100 --> 25:33.300
<i>as Tony Wong,</i>
<i>head of the Chinatown Triads.</i>

25:33.500 --> 25:35.200
That can't be.
That's the guy who killed me.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.900
<i>Police sources say Wong,</i>
<i>who was a suspect in...</i>

25:45.500 --> 25:49.500
Wait, I see him.
Wong. He's still alive.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.700
Of course he's still alive.
That's me they found.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.700
Can you see where he is now?

26:00.700 --> 26:03.500
I see a sign. Quick, give me a pen.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.500
I don't understand why Wong
would wanna kill me.

26:05.700 --> 26:08.600
- I never did anything to him.
- Yeah, but you look a lot like him.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.400
Maybe he used you
to fake his own death.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.100
What does that mean?

26:14.300 --> 26:17.500
Wu Han lmports.
It's a warehouse over in Chinatown.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.700
I don't know about this, Piper.
I think it's too dangerous.

26:31.900 --> 26:33.800
It's your only chance.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.300
Piper, listen to me.
You don't wanna go up there.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.900
Those men pulled the trigger on me
without even thinking.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.700
- They'll kill you.
- I can freeze things, remember?

26:41.800 --> 26:44.100
- But there are three thugs in there.
- Keep talking.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.700
- With guns.
- Even better.

26:45.900 --> 26:50.100
Wait, wait, wait. He's got an amulet
on the door. I can't go in.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.300
Never mind.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.300
- Aren't you scared?
- Terrified.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.000
Trust me, that's a good thing.

27:01.900 --> 27:04.700
Okay. We gotta hurry.

27:09.100 --> 27:10.200
Say, "cheese."

27:13.800 --> 27:15.400
Run!

27:16.000 --> 27:18.200
- Come on.
- Let's get her.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.000
Move, move!

27:56.900 --> 27:58.200
Okay, all set.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.000
I snuck the photograph
into Andy's interoffice mail.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.900
My afterlife's in the hands
of a cop named Andy.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.100
He's an inspector
and he's very good, Mark.

28:07.300 --> 28:11.500
After he sees Wong is alive,
he'll know exactly what to do.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.900
Busts Wong maybe,
but that doesn't help me.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.300
They won't have any way
of identifying the body as mine.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.300
I put your name in with the picture.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.900
Andy will get dental records
or something and match it up.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.700
All we have to do is keep
Yama away from you until then.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.600
I made you a promise, didn't I?

28:36.800 --> 28:39.100
As much as I like you,
I have no intention of joining you.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.100
Talking to yourself, huh?

28:43.400 --> 28:44.900
Andy. Hi.

28:45.100 --> 28:48.700
Yeah, it's an old habit,
I do it all the time.

28:48.900 --> 28:51.000
My mom used to call it
"interesting conversations

28:51.200 --> 28:53.900
- with an interesting person."
- Yeah? Interesting.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.200
Very.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.400
Not that it's not a pleasure,
but what are you doing?

28:57.600 --> 29:01.000
Oh, nothing, you know.
Just passing by.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.000
- Prue tell you what's going on?
- No.

29:04.100 --> 29:08.200
Well, yeah, I mean, sort of.
Kind of screwed up, huh?

29:08.400 --> 29:10.200
- Any idea what I should do?
- That Andy.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.200
Yeah.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.500
I mean, yeah.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.700
Just give her some space,
let her work it through.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.400
Yeah, okay.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.000
Thanks.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.500
- Take care.
- You too.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.200
What?

29:32.400 --> 29:35.100
You're a really sweet person,
you know that?

29:35.200 --> 29:37.800
No, I mean that.
I wanna take you somewhere.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.700
There's something
I wanna do for you.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.700
- Oh, Mr Correy...
- Stay away.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.400
Please, you have got
to believe me.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.000
You locked me in my room,
didn't you?

29:58.100 --> 29:59.400
Just for your own protection.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.200
What do you want? Money?
Is that what this is, a shakedown?

30:02.400 --> 30:06.000
No, I'm trying to save your life,
for God's sakes. Listen to me.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.100
You're crazy.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.200
If you walk out that door,
you're a dead man!

30:14.400 --> 30:17.100
- Call security.
- Mr Correy, don't do it!

30:20.600 --> 30:21.800
Watch out!

30:30.800 --> 30:32.400
Nick!

30:32.600 --> 30:36.600
That'll be 20 dollars, tip not included.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.100
This is your place?

30:53.300 --> 30:56.200
- It's beautiful.
- Thanks.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.400
Camus. I'm impressed.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.600
Wish I had a chance to finish it.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.100
Of course, I can say that
about almost everything, I guess.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.400
"A loveless world is a dead world,

31:07.600 --> 31:11.400
and always there comes an hour
when one is weary of prisons,

31:11.600 --> 31:14.100
and all one craves for
is a warm face,

31:14.200 --> 31:16.600
the warmth and wonder
of a loving heart."

31:16.800 --> 31:20.000
- I like that part.
- Me too.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.600
Listen, if your cop friend
comes through,

31:23.800 --> 31:27.700
maybe I'll get a chance to ask
Camus himself how it turns out.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.400
I want you to reach for something.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.400
Go ahead, open it.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.700
- What are they?
- My grandfather's recipes.

31:48.300 --> 31:50.600
My dad translated them
when I was born.

31:50.800 --> 31:54.600
They've been serving these
in my family's restaurant for decades.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.100
They're yours.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.200
But they belong in your family.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.900
I want you to have them.
For everything you've done for me.

32:04.300 --> 32:06.900
I just ask one favour.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.700
Use them for your sister's
surprise birthday party.

32:09.900 --> 32:14.000
- Prue doesn't want a party.
- Birthdays are important.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.900
I know.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.200
I walked out of my last one...

32:18.700 --> 32:21.100
...and it never occurred to me
that I wouldn't get another.

32:22.900 --> 32:27.100
She may not know it, but she needs
to celebrate her birthday.

32:27.300 --> 32:29.300
You all do.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.100
Don't take it for granted.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.500
Prue? What are you doing?

32:44.400 --> 32:47.500
- Just flicking through channels.
- You don't flick. You never flick.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.200
Well, I flick now.

32:50.700 --> 32:55.800
- Are you okay? You look...
- Awful? I know. But I feel fine.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.300
- Did you warn that guy?
- I did better than that.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.100
I saved that guy.

33:01.300 --> 33:02.700
And it was great too.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.500
I mean, I knew doing it
would be good for him,

33:05.600 --> 33:09.700
but I had no idea what a rush it
would be for me. I felt so good.

33:09.900 --> 33:13.300
And not just about myself,
but about everything.

33:13.500 --> 33:17.900
That even in my own little way,
I can make a difference.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.100
Can you believe it's me saying this?

33:21.100 --> 33:24.800
What can I say?
It's been a week full of surprises.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.400
Yeah, speaking of surprises,
what are you gonna do about Andy?

33:29.500 --> 33:30.600
I don't know.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.300
Andy kept something from me,

33:33.500 --> 33:35.900
but the truth is
I keep something from him every day.

33:37.500 --> 33:41.300
And it's not like I'll ever be able to tell
him our secret, so, what's the point?

33:41.500 --> 33:44.900
We're the charmed ones, Prue,
not the doomed ones.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.000
We have lives like everyone else.

33:47.200 --> 33:51.500
Call him. Go see him.
Do something.

33:51.700 --> 33:55.100
Give to get. That is the secret of life.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.100
Not our powers.

34:10.300 --> 34:13.000
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:13.199 --> 34:16.199
I was just thinking,
walking under the stars,

34:16.400 --> 34:17.800
what's really up there?

34:18.699 --> 34:20.800
- What's waiting for me?
- I don't know.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.300
Maybe you can give me a hint
when you get there.

34:23.500 --> 34:26.100
I don't want this night to ever end.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.100
I'm not ready to say goodbye, Piper.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.000
Close your eyes.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.600
Pretend you can feel my hand
on your skin.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.300
That my touch gives you comfort.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.000
No.

34:51.199 --> 34:53.400
Just close your eyes.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.400
Where were you my whole life?

35:13.500 --> 35:15.700
No. Piper!

35:17.000 --> 35:20.800
No! Somebody help! Help!

35:23.100 --> 35:24.900
- What's wrong? What happened?
- They took her.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.400
- Wong's men took Piper.
- Do you know where they took her?

35:29.700 --> 35:32.200
- I'm calling 911.
- No, do it from the car. Let's go.

35:32.300 --> 35:35.800
- We've got to find her.
- Even if it takes all night.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.900
First time I saw you,
I thought you were a ghost.

35:48.900 --> 35:52.700
You know, these ropes are really tight.
If you could just untie my hands.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.700
- Why did you kill Mark?
- I needed his identity.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.700
Who else knows I'm alive?

36:04.400 --> 36:06.100
I had plans.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.500
I had a boat ready
to take me to Hong Kong.

36:08.700 --> 36:12.900
I had a whole new life,
but you screwed it all up.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.500
Thanks.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.300
Quick, they have her upstairs.
Look out!

36:44.300 --> 36:46.900
I'll take her. You shoot anyone
who comes through that door.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.400
Look out!

37:02.800 --> 37:04.600
Thanks, sis.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.000
- Right back at you, sis.
- How long's this last again?

37:09.200 --> 37:10.300
Not very.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.000
Who are you people?

37:29.200 --> 37:31.000
Police! Freeze!

37:43.300 --> 37:45.000
I've never seen
anybody killed before.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.700
- Jeremy.
- Javna.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.400
I mean humans.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.600
Come on, we need to get out of here
before Andy sees us.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.200
Wong.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.400
But you're dead.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.200
Yeah, so are you.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.100
Mark, I think you should
get out of here.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.800
Make a wish, you bastard.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.200
No!

38:57.100 --> 38:59.000
No! You can't take him.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.300
He's a good man.
He doesn't belong with you.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.800
Let us remember,
though we gather in sorrow,

39:22.000 --> 39:26.600
we are here to celebrate
the joy of Mark's life.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.200
And the redemption
of his spiritual journey.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.000
All those stories.

39:46.200 --> 39:49.800
All those legends you taught me.
They saved my soul, Mom.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.700
You were right.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.000
Take it from me, Prue.

40:03.600 --> 40:07.000
Don't miss your birthday,
not any of them.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.600
They're precious.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.500
I won't.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.100
I wish...

40:19.100 --> 40:21.900
I know. Me too.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.000
I'm gonna miss you, Piper.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.100
Who's that man?

40:50.400 --> 40:52.400
That's my dad.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.400
I guess this really is goodbye.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.600
Leave it to me to fall for a dead guy.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.000
It's an improvement.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.000
- At least he wasn't a warlock.
- Yeah.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.800
You know what?
I've changed my mind.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.200
Maybe we should
have a party, after all.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.600
Are you serious?

41:43.800 --> 41:46.700
Yeah, why not?
I mean, Mark is right.

41:46.800 --> 41:50.500
Well, Prue,
I'm glad you said that, because...

41:50.700 --> 41:52.400
Surprise!

41:56.800 --> 41:59.400
- Did I get you? I got you.
- Yeah, you got me.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.700
And an actual present too.
And it's paid for.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.300
- I hope you like it.
- I'm speechless.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.000
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.
