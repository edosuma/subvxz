OK, look, we don't have to call her.

34:13.645 --> 34:14.939
I was in a hole for a week.

34:15.023 --> 34:16.901
Maybe we call her mom.

34:19.239 --> 34:21.035
With respect and love.

-Hey, Mom.

34:35.438 --> 34:39.112
-[Sarah] What do you need?
-[clears throat] OK, um,

34:40.406 --> 34:42.536
some really scary stuff
has been happening,

34:42.620 --> 34:45.166
and it has something to do with a kid

34:45.249 --> 34:47.588
you went to school with.
His name was Harold Biddle.

34:48.757 --> 34:50.301
OK, listen to me.

34:50.385 --> 34:53.850
Do not talk to anyone else about this, OK?

34:53.934 --> 34:56.188
The other parents can't be trusted.

34:56.271 --> 34:58.067
I'll be there as soon as I can.

35:56.016 --> 35:57.978
Not all of us made it,

35:58.062 --> 35:59.356
but we found what you were looking for.

35:59.439 --> 36:00.984
Yes!

36:02.445 --> 36:04.157
Oh, my old friend.

36:04.241 --> 36:05.661
How I've missed you.

36:07.540 --> 36:08.750
What is this?

36:09.710 --> 36:11.129
Is this a joke?

36:11.673 --> 36:12.800
Where is he?

36:13.718 --> 36:15.012
Where is he?

36:15.556 --> 36:17.267
Where is he?
