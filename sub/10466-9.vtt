WEBVTT

00:19.410 --> 00:21.673
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

00:21.673 --> 00:23.110
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.633
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED
A LIFT.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.809
NO, THAT'S OK.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.767
WELL, SOMETIMES REED
GIVES ME A RIDE

00:28.767 --> 00:30.117
ON HIS WAY OVER
TO GRIFFIN'S,

00:30.117 --> 00:31.553
SO...

00:31.553 --> 00:33.642
WHY DON'T
I CATCH YOU LATER AT HOME?

00:33.642 --> 00:34.904
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:34.904 --> 00:36.645
GET IN THE CAR,
CLAUD.

00:36.645 --> 00:37.689
COME ON, CHARLIE.

00:37.689 --> 00:38.908
GET IN THE CAR.

00:44.870 --> 00:48.004
LOOK, UM,
AS LONG AS WE'RE ALONE,

00:48.004 --> 00:49.745
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING,

00:49.745 --> 00:52.748
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
GOING ON WITH ME.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.663
I HAVEN'T TOLD
THE OTHERS YET.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.665
I WANTED
TO TELL YOU FIRST.

01:00.495 --> 01:03.585
I'M KINDA, UM...

01:03.585 --> 01:07.284
IT TURNS OUT
I'VE GOT THIS--
THIS THING,

01:07.284 --> 01:10.722
THIS DISEASE THING.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.246
WHAT, LIKE V.D.
OR SOMETHING?

01:12.246 --> 01:13.769
CHARLIE.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.598
NO, IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.

01:16.598 --> 01:21.646
IT'S CALLED HODGKIN'S.HODGKIN'S, I DON'T--

01:21.646 --> 01:24.736
IT'S A DISEASE
OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM,

01:24.736 --> 01:28.262
AND SOMETIMES
IT TURNS UP IN GUYS
ABOUT MY AGE.

01:28.262 --> 01:31.787
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN
FEELING SO, YOU KNOW,

01:31.787 --> 01:33.745
KINDA DRAGGY
AND RUN DOWN

01:33.745 --> 01:35.878
FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.706
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

01:37.706 --> 01:42.928
I KNOW. ME, TOO,
BUT I WENT TO SEE
THE DOCTOR,

01:42.928 --> 01:45.366
AND SHE DIAGNOSED IT
RIGHT AWAY,

01:45.366 --> 01:47.237
WHICH IS GREAT
BECAUSE IF IT'S
CAUGHT EARLY,

01:47.237 --> 01:49.674
WHICH MINE
DEFINITELY WAS,

01:49.674 --> 01:53.417
THEN THIS THING'S,
LIKE, 100% CURABLE.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.158
IT'S, LIKE,
100% CURABLE

01:55.158 --> 01:56.855
OR IT IS 100% CURABLE?

01:56.855 --> 01:58.770
I'M GOING TO BE FINE,
CLAUDIA.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.598
OK?

02:00.598 --> 02:02.383
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE
SOME TREATMENTS AND STUFF,

02:02.383 --> 02:05.647
WHICH JUST MEANS
GOING INTO THE DOCTOR'S
OFFICE EVERY DAY

02:05.647 --> 02:06.778
FOR, LIKE, 5 MINUTES.

02:06.778 --> 02:07.823
FOR WHAT, MEDICINE?

02:07.823 --> 02:10.304
YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.783
THEY JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE

02:11.783 --> 02:13.611
THAT YOU'RE GETTING
THE RIGHT DOSAGE.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.918
IT TAKES 6 WEEKS,

02:15.918 --> 02:19.182
AND THEN IT'S OVER.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.837
I'M TOTALLY
BACK TO NORMAL.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.102
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE DOCTOR TOLD ME?

02:26.102 --> 02:28.887
SHE SAID
THAT IF YOU HAVE
TO HAVE A DISEASE,

02:28.887 --> 02:31.542
HODGKIN'S IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THE BEST ONES
TO HAVE.

02:33.544 --> 02:34.806
THAT'S PRETTY
REASSURING, HUH?

02:36.634 --> 02:38.158
OK.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.775

05:44.822 --> 05:47.347
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PROMISE ME ANYTHING.

05:51.394 --> 05:54.441
I'M SORRY.

05:54.441 --> 05:57.792
FORGET IT, OK?
IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT NINA'S FAULT.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.185
IT WAS JUST--
IT WAS BAD TIMING.

06:00.185 --> 06:03.928
ANYWAY, I HAVE MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT.

06:03.928 --> 06:06.931
I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU DO.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.978
I HAVE MY FIRST
APPOINTMENT TOMORROW

06:09.978 --> 06:11.153

06:16.680 --> 06:18.029
WHAT ARE THEY--

06:18.029 --> 06:19.030
WHAT IS THAT?

06:19.030 --> 06:20.945
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.078
ALL KINDS OF TESTS--
SOME SCAN THING

06:23.078 --> 06:24.775
THAT TELLS THEM
WHERE IT IS
IN YOUR BODY,

06:24.775 --> 06:26.995
WHICH LYMPH NODES,
YOU KNOW?

06:26.995 --> 06:29.824
I GUESS THAT
PRETTY MUCH DETERMINES
HOW BAD IT IS,

06:29.824 --> 06:31.434
WHAT KIND OF TREATMENTS
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.961
GOD, CHARLIE.I KNOW.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.616
BUT THIS ISN'T
ACTUALLY HAPPENING
TO ME.

06:39.616 --> 06:40.791
SO THAT'S THE REASON
I'M SO CALM.

06:44.926 --> 06:47.015
CAN I--
CAN I COME WITH YOU?

06:47.015 --> 06:49.191
TOMORROW TO THE APPOINTMENT?KIRSTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

06:49.191 --> 06:51.628
'CAUSE I FEEL
REALLY BAD, CHARLIE.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.151
I FEEL LIKE
I KEEP LEAVING YOU

06:53.151 --> 06:54.544
AT ALL
THE MOST IMPORTANT TIMES.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.067
BUT I PROMISE YOU,

06:56.067 --> 06:57.808
IN 2 WEEKS, ALL THIS
IS GOING TO BE OVER,

06:57.808 --> 06:59.027
AND I'M GOING TO BE HERE

06:59.027 --> 07:01.421
FOR ANYTHING
THAT YOU NEED.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.987
OK.

07:02.987 --> 07:04.641
'CAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.295
I'M NOT.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.602
I'M NOT. I HAVEN'T
TOLD JULIA YET,

07:08.602 --> 07:10.038
BUT I TOLD BAILEY
AND CLAUDIA.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.605
THEY WERE BOTH GREAT.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.781
OF COURSE THEY WERE.

07:13.781 --> 07:14.912
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

07:14.912 --> 07:16.523
I DON'T KNOW.

07:16.523 --> 07:19.308
I GUESS I THOUGHT
MAYBE THEY'D PANIC,

07:19.308 --> 07:20.831
FREAK OUT OR SOMETHING,
I DON'T KNOW.

07:20.831 --> 07:24.531
I MEAN,
CLAUDIA'S ONLY 14.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.880
SHE'S OLD ENOUGH.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.623
YEAH, SHE IS.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.973
EXCUSE ME. I THINK
THESE PAMPHLETS YOU GAVE ME

07:31.973 --> 07:34.149
ARE KIND OF OUT OF DATE.I'M SORRY?

07:34.149 --> 07:36.281
WELL, THE STATISTICS ON
SURVIVAL RATES

07:36.281 --> 07:38.806
ARE KIND OF OFF.
SO I JUST DON'T THINK

07:38.806 --> 07:40.721
THEY HAVE
THE MOST RECENT
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.900
I NEED YOUR ABSOLUTE
LATEST INFORMATION.

07:45.900 --> 07:49.643
THIS IS THE LATEST
INFORMATION.

07:49.643 --> 07:52.907
ABOUT HODGKIN'S DISEASE.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.474
YES.

07:57.172 --> 07:59.653
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
THAT YOU'RE NOT FINDING?

08:03.221 --> 08:04.614
NO.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.836
THAT'S OK.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.673
CHARLIE?

08:19.673 --> 08:21.631
HI, JULE.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.286
YOU GOT HERE FAST, HUH?

08:24.286 --> 08:26.114
WHAT?

08:26.114 --> 08:28.029
WELL, I LEFT YOU
A MESSAGE.

08:28.029 --> 08:30.858
OH, I, UH,
I DIDN'T GET IT.

08:30.858 --> 08:32.424
THAT'S OK.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.252
I JUST, UH, JUST SAID
I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU,

08:34.252 --> 08:35.558
AND YOU'RE HERE, SO...

08:35.558 --> 08:38.518
WELL, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU, TOO.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.303
OK. SO WE'RE BOTH--

08:41.303 --> 08:43.610
CHARLIE, CAN I BORROW
SOME KITCHEN STUFF?

08:43.610 --> 08:45.437
KITCHEN STUFF?

08:45.437 --> 08:48.440
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
JUST A POT
AND SOME SILVERWARE

08:48.440 --> 08:49.703
AND STUFF.

08:49.703 --> 08:50.921
EVERYTHING THAT
WE HAD WAS RENTED,

08:50.921 --> 08:52.183
AND WE HAD TO RETURN IT.
SO...

08:53.402 --> 08:55.056
I'M SORRY. I'M NOT...

08:55.056 --> 08:58.668
GRIFFIN LOST
MOST OF HIS MONEY.

08:58.668 --> 09:01.889
THE BUSINESS
WAS REALLY BAD,

09:01.889 --> 09:03.499
AND SO HE HAD TO BORROW
TO KEEP IT GOING.

09:03.499 --> 09:05.588
AND WE HAVE TO GIVE UP
THE APARTMENT,

09:05.588 --> 09:06.981
AND WE'VE RETURNED
OUR FURNITURE,

09:06.981 --> 09:08.460
AND WE'RE LIVING
IN THIS EMPTY SPACE,

09:08.460 --> 09:10.201
AND IT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF HORRIBLE.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.858
LOOK,
TAKE WHATEVER YOU NEED.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.651
WHY DON'T YOU
COME LIVE AT HOME?

09:24.651 --> 09:26.174
HAVING YOU AT HOME
RIGHT NOW WOULD BE--

09:26.174 --> 09:30.526
GOD! NO, THAT--THAT IS
THE LAST THING WE WANT.

09:30.526 --> 09:33.094
I MEAN,
THE WHOLE POINT
TO THIS

09:33.094 --> 09:34.399
IS THAT WE DO THIS
ON OUR OWN.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.750
I KNOW. I KNOW THAT.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.709
I MEAN, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT EVERYONE NEEDS
A LITTLE HELP

09:39.709 --> 09:41.102
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

09:41.102 --> 09:42.146
AND IF IT MAKES IT
EASIER FOR YOU GUYS,

09:42.146 --> 09:44.540
I CAN REALLY USE--STOP IT.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.543
CHARLIE, OK?
I'M NOT COMING HOME.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.066
GRIFFIN AND I
WILL WORK THIS OUT OURSELVES

09:49.066 --> 09:51.112
LIKE ANY MARRIED COUPLE.

09:51.112 --> 09:55.420
I JUST--I TOLD YOU
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
REALLY GREAT,

09:55.420 --> 09:57.684
AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO KNOW.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.166
THANKS FOR THE STUFF.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.907
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.910
OH, UM, YOU HAD SOMETHING
YOU WANTED TO TALK ABOUT?

10:08.999 --> 10:11.480
NAH, YOU GOT ENOUGH
ON YOUR MIND RIGHT NOW.

10:14.962 --> 10:15.832
OK.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.845
THAT IS SO...
BAILEY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.586
YEAH, WELL...

10:30.586 --> 10:33.371
I MEAN, HE SEEMS SO...

10:33.371 --> 10:35.983
EVEN LAST WEEK
AT THE WEDDING,
HE SEEMED SO...

10:35.983 --> 10:36.853
I KNOW.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.510
CANCER?

10:41.510 --> 10:44.469
YEAH, CANCER.

10:46.428 --> 10:49.387
DO YOU THINK
HE'S GOING TO BE OK?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.476
I MEAN, BAILEY,
HE'S GOT TO BE OK.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.782
I DON'T KNOW.

10:54.262 --> 11:00.094
WHAT CAN I DO?NOTHING.

11:00.094 --> 11:02.966
HE'S NOT--
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE CLOSE OR ANYTHING.

11:02.966 --> 11:06.404
WELL, YEAH, BUT I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP

11:06.404 --> 11:08.058
IF HE NEEDS SOMETHING.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.973
WELL, THEN, HE'S GOT
CLAUDIA, JULIA, OR ME

11:09.973 --> 11:10.844
TO GET IT FOR HIM.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.978
LOOK, SARAH,
THIS IS A FAMILY THING,
OK?

11:14.978 --> 11:17.938
AND WE'RE GOOD
AT THIS KIND OF STUFF.

11:17.938 --> 11:22.203
HE'S GOT US.
SO THANKS ANYWAY.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.774
CHARLIE.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.428
CHARLIE.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.213
SHH. I FINALLY
GOT OWEN TO GO DOWN.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.345
I WENT TO THE MEDICAL
CENTER TODAY.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.999
I LOOKED IT UP.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.392
LOOKED UP WHAT?

11:37.392 --> 11:39.046
IT'S NOT JUST
A DISEASE.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.178
HODGKIN'S--
IT'S CANCER.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.180
CLAUDIA--ISN'T IT?!

11:43.180 --> 11:44.747
WOULD YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN?

11:49.056 --> 11:52.494
IT'S A KIND OF CANCER,
CLAUDIA, YES, BUT--

11:52.494 --> 11:54.191
ONLY YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO KNOW THAT, DID YOU?

11:54.191 --> 11:57.499
I DIDN'T THINK YOU NEEDED
TO HEAR THAT WORD.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.805
WHAT ABOUT THE WORDS
"RADIATION"

11:58.805 --> 12:00.197
AND "CHEMOTHERAPY," HUH?

12:00.197 --> 12:01.938
'CAUSE THOSE
ARE THE TREATMENTS

12:01.938 --> 12:03.374
THAT YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT, ISN'T IT?

12:03.374 --> 12:05.202
I DIDN'T WANT
TO SCARE YOU.

12:05.202 --> 12:08.902
SO, IN OTHER WORDS...
IT'S BAD.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.774
YEAH, I MEAN,
IT MUST BE BAD,

12:11.774 --> 12:13.733
OR YOU WOULD'VE
LEVELED WITH ME.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.256
YOU SAID IT'S CANCER,

12:15.256 --> 12:16.997
AND ONE IN 4 PEOPLE
WHO GET IT DIE FROM IT.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.868
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.827
YOU SAID
IT'S 100% CURABLE.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.785
AND THEN...

12:22.785 --> 12:24.613
YOU BOUGHT ME
AN ICE CREAM.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.962
CLAUDIA, COME ON.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.882
ARE YOU GOING TO DIE?NO.

12:32.882 --> 12:35.232
CLAUDIA, I AM NOT
GOING TO DIE.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.845
WHY SHOULD I
BELIEVE YOU?

12:57.689 --> 12:58.821
BAILEY?

13:02.042 --> 13:03.478
WHAT ARE YOU--

13:04.827 --> 13:07.264
IT'S TOO LATE
TO CALL, RIGHT?

13:09.832 --> 13:11.573
NOT JAPAN.

13:14.228 --> 13:15.403
OH.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.970
CHARLIE.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.757
HE'S PROBABLY ASLEEP,
DON'T YOU THINK?

13:21.757 --> 13:24.978
I JUST KEEP THINKING...

13:24.978 --> 13:27.719
WHAT IF HE'S...
JUST LYING THERE IN BED

13:27.719 --> 13:29.852
STARING AT THE CEILING

13:29.852 --> 13:32.333
AND HE'S GOING OVER
AND OVER THIS THING
IN HIS MIND AND...

13:32.333 --> 13:33.638
FEELING ALONE AND SCARED?

13:33.638 --> 13:34.814
AND I SHOULD
CALL HIM, RIGHT?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.772
I SHOULD CALL HIM
AND SAY...

13:36.772 --> 13:39.601
AND SAY...

13:39.601 --> 13:42.647
GOD, WHAT DO I SAY?

13:42.647 --> 13:43.823
WELL...

13:44.954 --> 13:46.347
HOW ABOUT, "I LOVE YOU,

13:46.347 --> 13:48.131
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS."

13:48.131 --> 13:50.307
I ALREADY SAID THAT TO HIM
WHEN HE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS,

13:50.307 --> 13:52.962
BUT WHAT DOES THAT DO
TO MAKE THIS BETTER FOR HIM?

13:52.962 --> 13:56.792
HOW DOES THAT HELP HIM?
AND THE TRUTH IS,

13:56.792 --> 14:00.230
WHAT CAN I POSSIBLY SAY
THAT'S GONNA MAKE ANY
DIFFERENCE TO HIM?

14:00.230 --> 14:02.885
I MEAN, WHAT DO I KNOW
ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

14:02.885 --> 14:06.454
REALLY?

14:06.454 --> 14:09.152
YOU'VE NEVER FELT LIKE
YOU WERE TOTALLY ALONE

14:09.152 --> 14:11.111
AND AFRAID?

14:11.111 --> 14:14.070
YOU'VE NEVER FELT LIKE
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE STRENGTH

14:14.070 --> 14:15.680
TO MAKE IT THROUGH
THE NEXT HOUR,

14:15.680 --> 14:17.160
NEVER MIND
THE WHOLE NIGHT?

14:18.422 --> 14:20.903
GEE,

14:20.903 --> 14:22.992
YOUR RECOVERY
MUST HAVE BEEN
A PIECE OF CAKE

14:22.992 --> 14:24.559
COMPARED TO MINE.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.831
YOU GOT THROUGH
THE PAST 7 MONTHS,
RIGHT?

14:35.831 --> 14:38.703
YEAH.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.358
YOU DO KNOW HOW
TO HELP HIM, BAILEY.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.848
ARE YOU READY?

14:52.848 --> 14:55.068
AM I READY?

14:55.068 --> 14:57.026
FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT.
ARE YOU READY?

14:57.026 --> 14:59.115
WELL, THERE'S GAS
IN THE CAR,

14:59.115 --> 15:00.943
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU MEAN.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.598
NO, CHARLIE, I'M NOT
TALKING ABOUT GAS.

15:03.598 --> 15:07.471
DO YOU HAVE
OUR FAMILY HISTORY?

15:07.471 --> 15:09.430
CLAUD, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.823
LOOK, CHARLIE, I KNOW
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN HANDLE THIS,

15:11.823 --> 15:13.477
BUT I CAN, OK?

15:13.477 --> 15:15.131
I'M NOT JUST SOME
LITTLE BABY ANYMORE.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.570
NOW, DO YOU HAVE
OUR MEDICAL HISTORY,

15:19.570 --> 15:21.877
BOTH FOR YOU
AND MOM AND DAD?

15:21.877 --> 15:24.271
I'LL MAKE SURE
I HAVE IT, CLAUD.

15:24.271 --> 15:27.970
GOOD, 'CAUSE I'VE READ
THAT THEY'RE GONNA
ASK YOU ALL ABOUT THAT.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.841
AND THEY'RE GONNA TAKE
A TON OF BLOOD.

15:29.841 --> 15:33.933
AND DO ALL THESE TESTS,
LIKE AN EKG AND...

15:33.933 --> 15:36.500
A RECTAL EXAM.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.591
YOU READ ABOUT THAT, TOO?UH-HUH.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.463
I ALSO READ ABOUT
HOW THEY DO THIS SCAN

15:42.463 --> 15:44.465
TO FIND OUT HOW FAR
THE DISEASE IS
IN YOUR BODY--

15:44.465 --> 15:47.381
LIKE, IN ONE LYMPH NODE,
IN MORE THAN ONE
LYMPH NODE.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.860
OR IN MORE THAN
ONE LYMPH NODE,

15:48.860 --> 15:50.340
BUT IN 2 DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE BODY,

15:50.340 --> 15:52.125
LIKE ONE IN THE RIGHT
AND ONE IN THE LEFT.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.736
OR IN BOTH
THE LYMPH NODES
AND IN THE ORGANS,

15:54.736 --> 15:56.433
UH, LIKE THE LIVER.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.739
THANK YOU.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.443
I THINK THE MORE YOU KNOW
ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

16:06.443 --> 16:07.923
THE BETTER IT IS.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.408
YEAH.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.130
HEY.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.263
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.308
I MEAN, THANKS
AND EVERYTHING,
BUT...

16:45.308 --> 16:47.136
WHAT TIME'S
YOUR TEST TODAY?

16:47.136 --> 16:49.051
UM, 4:00.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.661
4:00.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.185
BUT IT'S OK.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.403
KIRSTEN'S GOING,

16:53.403 --> 16:55.101
AND CLAUDIA KIND OF
INSISTED,

16:55.101 --> 16:56.972
SO YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.191
I'M THERE, MAN.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.238
LOOK, BAILEY...

17:02.238 --> 17:06.112
THERE'S GONNA BE
OTHER TESTS,

17:06.112 --> 17:08.853
RADIATION, MAYBE CHEMO.

17:08.853 --> 17:12.248
I MEAN, I COULD BE IN
PRETTY BAD SHAPE,
AND I'LL NEED...

17:12.248 --> 17:14.076
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
THERE'S GONNA BE

17:14.076 --> 17:16.165
PLENTY OF OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES
DOWN THE ROAD.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.819
NO. THERE'S JUST TODAY.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.864
THAT'S HOW YOU GOTTA
THINK ABOUT IT, CHARLIE.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.257
THERE'S JUST TODAY,

17:21.257 --> 17:23.085
AND TODAY IS RIGHT NOW.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.913
IT'S RIGHT NOW.
IT'S THIS SECOND.

17:24.913 --> 17:27.959
SO WHATEVER YOU HAVE
TO DO RIGHT NOW
TO GET THROUGH IT,

17:27.959 --> 17:29.613
YOU DO IT.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.833
YOU WORRY ABOUT TOMORROW
TOMORROW.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.356
JUST TAKE ONE DAY
AT A TIME.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.490
COME ON, BAILEY.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.100
HEY, IT WORKS.

17:38.100 --> 17:41.060
THE BIG PICTURE,
THE FUTURE?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.452
THAT IS HUGE, MAN,

17:42.452 --> 17:43.975
AND, GOD,
IT'S SO SCARY.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.412
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

17:45.412 --> 17:46.543
YOU KNOW?

17:46.543 --> 17:47.762
YEAH.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.111
YEAH. AND TODAY...

17:49.111 --> 17:51.896
TODAY'S JUST 24 HOURS.

17:51.896 --> 17:55.117
AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU'RE UNCONSCIOUS
FOR 8 OF THEM,

17:55.117 --> 17:58.207
AND A GOOD FOOTBALL GAME
TAKES UP 3 OF THEM.

17:58.207 --> 17:59.252
AND IF YOU GIVE ME
A HAND HERE--

17:59.252 --> 18:01.036
THAT'S AN HOUR EASY.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.168
NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO 10.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.865
12.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.562
WHATEVER.
YOU GET MY POINT.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.129
YOU JUST DEAL WITH WHAT'S
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.133
[SIGH]

18:11.133 --> 18:12.613
OK.

18:12.613 --> 18:16.530
WELL...I'LL TRY THAT.

18:16.530 --> 18:17.879
THANKS.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.750
AND--HEY.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.361
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
REALLY HELPS

18:21.361 --> 18:23.014
IS KEEPING BUSY,

18:23.014 --> 18:24.538
NOT SITTING AROUND
THINKING ALL THE TIME.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.931
YOU GOTTA GET OUT
AND DO STUFF AND...

18:26.931 --> 18:28.629
YOU KNOW, GET
OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.892
AND WHAT DO YOU
RECOMMEND?

18:30.892 --> 18:32.807
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

18:32.807 --> 18:35.940
YOU GOT 5 YEARS'
WORTH OF CRUD
ON THAT WINDSHIELD.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.249
HEY.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.208
IT WORKS, MAN.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.701
CLAUDIA? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

18:57.701 --> 19:00.051
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.491
I THINK YOU SHOULD
MOVE BACK HOME, JULIA.

19:04.491 --> 19:05.883
I REALLY DO.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.102
GREAT.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.451
ANOTHER COUNTRY
HEARD FROM.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.540
SO--SO CHARLIE TOLD YOU.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.020
YEAH, OF COURSE
HE TOLD ME.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.456
HE TOLD ME AS SOON
AS HE FOUND OUT.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.892
THAT'S GREAT.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.242
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.157
WAIT A SECOND.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.549
YOU'RE PISSED?

19:19.549 --> 19:22.596
YOU DON'T THINK
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW?

19:22.596 --> 19:25.599
NO...
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.905
IT'S JUST I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO WORRY.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.777
THIS WHOLE THING
IS SO...

19:29.777 --> 19:31.431
I KNOW, SCARY.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.128
THAT'S WHY I THINK
IT'D BE EASIER IF...

19:33.128 --> 19:34.825
IF YOU WENT BACK HOME.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.784
CLAUD, GRIFFIN AND I
DON'T WANT TO,

19:36.784 --> 19:38.699
ANYTHING WE CAN DO
TO AVOID THAT.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.744
I TOLD CHARLIE.

19:40.744 --> 19:43.356
AND HE PROBABLY SAID
THAT HE DIDN'T
NEED YOU TO, RIGHT?

19:43.356 --> 19:45.619
RIGHT? SEE, THAT'S HOW
HE'S DEALING WITH THIS
WHOLE THING, JULIA,

19:45.619 --> 19:46.750
LIKE IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.622
BUT...

19:48.622 --> 19:50.450
I READ ABOUT IT, JULE,

19:50.450 --> 19:53.670
AND IT'S GONNA GET WORSE.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.934
I MEAN, HE COULD BE
IN REALLY BAD SHAPE
IN ANOTHER FEW WEEKS,

19:56.934 --> 19:59.328
DEPENDING ON WHAT
KIND OF TREATMENTS
THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES.

19:59.328 --> 20:01.243
WHAT?

20:01.243 --> 20:02.592
OH.

20:02.592 --> 20:05.116
OH, SO HE DOWNPLAYED IT
TO YOU, TOO.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.857
YEAH, I MEAN, IF THEY SAY
THAT HE NEEDS CHEMO,

20:06.857 --> 20:08.555
HE'S NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO--

20:08.555 --> 20:11.732
CHEMO?
CHEMOTHERAPY?

20:11.732 --> 20:13.690
THAT'S ONLY IF IT'S
HODGKIN'S STAGE 2B,

20:13.690 --> 20:15.562
AND WE WON'T KNOW THAT
UNTIL AFTER THE TEST.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.346
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:17.346 --> 20:19.609
EVEN IF THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THEY SAY HE HAS TO GO,

20:19.609 --> 20:21.829
EVEN RADIATION'S
GONNA WIPE HIM OUT.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.315
IT COULD GET
REALLY BAD,

20:29.315 --> 20:32.056
AND...I THINK THAT
IF YOU WERE THERE,

20:32.056 --> 20:33.275
IT'D JUST...

20:33.275 --> 20:35.234
IT'D REALLY HELP.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.851
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL
YOUR FURNITURE?

20:47.463 --> 20:49.987
NOW I NEED YOU TO
DRINK IT ALL DOWN,
THE WHOLE PITCHER.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.598
IT'S ABOUT 2 GLASSES, OK?

20:51.598 --> 20:53.426
IT'S ORANGE-FLAVORED,
LIKE TANG, YOU KNOW?

20:53.426 --> 20:54.862
GREAT.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.864
TRUST ME, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.518
IT'S REAL SWEET.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.347
IT MAKES MOST PEOPLE
SICK TO THEIR STOMACH,

21:01.347 --> 21:03.349
PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE
ALREADY NAUSEATED.

21:03.349 --> 21:04.915
ARE YOU, UH...

21:04.915 --> 21:05.916
YEAH. I'M FEELING...

21:05.916 --> 21:07.875
RIGHT.
WELL...

21:07.875 --> 21:09.659
I WANT YOU TO FINISH IT
FOR ME, OK?

21:09.659 --> 21:11.618
IT'S A CONTRAST FLUID.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.446
IT'LL HELP US SEE
WHAT WE NEED TO SEE
IN YOUR TEST.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.274
YOU GOT IT.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.725
THAT'S--THAT'S ENOUGH.

21:45.826 --> 21:46.827
OH, MY GOD.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.134
OH, MY GOD.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.135
CHARLIE, ARE YOU...

21:51.135 --> 21:53.094
MAN, THAT'S--

21:53.094 --> 21:54.748
DON'T. DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T LOOK
AT THE PITCHER.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.358
JUST TAKE IT ONE THING
AT A TIME, CHARLIE.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.881
ONE GLASS AT A TIME.

21:57.881 --> 21:58.926
ALL RIGHT, BAILEY.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.380
[EXHALES FORCEFULLY]

22:29.870 --> 22:32.046
OHH...YOU DID IT.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.744
WAY TO GO, MAN.
JUST GOT ONE MORE.

22:34.744 --> 22:35.615
[CLAUDIA SNIFFLES]

22:36.790 --> 22:38.922
CLAUDIA.

22:38.922 --> 22:42.186
WHAT? I'M UPSET
FOR HIM. I'M ALLOWED
TO BE UPSET FOR HIM.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.319
THIS IS NOT HELPING, CLAUD.FOR GOD'S SAKE, CLAUD,

22:44.319 --> 22:46.408
YOU WANT
SOMEBODY TO
TAKE YOU HOME?

22:46.408 --> 22:47.975
NO. PLEASE LET ME STAY,
CHARLIE.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.020
I...I WANT TO BE
HERE WITH YOU.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.679
HEY.
WHERE THE HELL'S
JULIA, ANYWAY?

22:56.679 --> 22:58.551
DIDN'T SHE KNOW
WHAT TIME
THE TEST WAS?

22:58.551 --> 23:00.030
SHE'S NOT COMING.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.858
I HAVEN'T
TOLD HER YET.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.034
WHAT?

23:04.034 --> 23:06.297
SHE'S GOT ENOUGH
OF HER OWN STUFF
GOING ON.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.908
HERE YOU GO.

23:07.908 --> 23:08.909
I TOLD HER.

23:08.909 --> 23:11.128
WHAT?

23:11.128 --> 23:13.000
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS A SECRET.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.002
GOD, CLAUDIA!

23:15.002 --> 23:17.439
YOU CAN'T YELL
AT ME FOR THIS.I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.702
CHARLIE, JUST FORGET IT.WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

23:19.702 --> 23:22.488
SO SHE KNOWS THAT I'M SICK?
DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT
THE TEST TODAY, TOO?

23:22.488 --> 23:24.490
I TOLD HER
I WAS COMING WITH YOU.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.014
MAN! NICE OF HER
TO SHOW UP.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.103
CHARLIE, THIS IS SO
NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.714
SHE'S RIGHT.
JUST FOCUS ON WHAT
YOU GOTTA FOCUS ON.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.890
WOULD YOU STOP WITH
THE AA STUFF FOR
JUST ONE MINUTE, BAY?

23:33.890 --> 23:35.762
Kirsten: HE'S ONLY
TRYING TO HELP.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.677
YEAH, WELL, I COULD USE
A LITTLE LESS HELP
FROM EVERYBODY.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.204
I'VE GOT--

23:43.204 --> 23:46.599
I'VE GOT ONE MORE
GLASS TO GO.

23:46.599 --> 23:47.469
OK.

24:09.883 --> 24:10.797
CHARLIE?

24:14.235 --> 24:15.149
SARAH.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.370
ARE YOU OK?

24:19.370 --> 24:22.809
YEAH. I JUST...
I DON'T KNOW.

24:22.809 --> 24:26.160
WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
'CAUSE JULIA AND BAILEY
AREN'T--

24:26.160 --> 24:28.249
NO. NO, I KNOW.
UM...

24:28.249 --> 24:31.121
ACTUALLY, UM...
I WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.864
I MADE THIS FOR YOU.
IT'S, UM...

24:34.864 --> 24:41.828
WELL, IT'S STUPID.
IT'S BANANA BREAD.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.526
THANKS.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.920
LOOK, I KNOW THIS WHOLE
THING REALLY ISN'T MY BUSINESS,

24:46.920 --> 24:50.924
BUT...I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I CARE ABOUT YOU.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.579
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.972
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT I CAN DO,

24:55.972 --> 24:57.974
PLEASE, TELL ME.

24:59.976 --> 25:02.152
SO CAN I GET
SOME MORE BANANA BREAD?

25:04.459 --> 25:05.852
[CHUCKLES] SURE.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.593
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHS]

25:14.251 --> 25:16.732
[SIGHS]

25:16.732 --> 25:19.518
HE'S EXACTLY
THE RIGHT AGE
TO GET IT.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.258
THAT'S WHAT
THE BOOK SAYS.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.259
YEAH?

25:22.259 --> 25:24.871
MM-HMM.

25:24.871 --> 25:27.917
THE STATISTICS--YOU KNOW, THE
5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE AND STUFF--

25:27.917 --> 25:29.179
THEY'RE NOT THAT BAD.

25:32.879 --> 25:34.881
SO I GUESS
IF YOU HAVE...CANCER,

25:34.881 --> 25:37.405
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD
CANCER TO HAVE...

25:37.405 --> 25:38.449
HODGKIN'S.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.497
HODGKIN'S.

25:45.979 --> 25:49.243
WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME?
GRIFFIN?

25:49.243 --> 25:52.463
I MEAN, THAT'S GOTTA
MEAN SOMETHING, DOESN'T IT?

25:52.463 --> 25:54.683
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DON'T YOU CALL HIM?

25:54.683 --> 25:57.077
I MEAN, GOD, HE--
HE TOLD CLAUDIA.

25:57.077 --> 25:59.862
AND NOW HE PROBABLY
KNOWS THAT I KNOW,

25:59.862 --> 26:02.691
AND HE STILL
ISN'T CALLING.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.998
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO TELL YOU, JULE.

26:04.998 --> 26:09.350
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THE MOST IRONIC THING IS?

26:09.350 --> 26:14.573
I AM SO...ANGRY
AT HIM RIGHT NOW.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.878
BUT...

26:15.878 --> 26:18.881
I THINK WE NEED
TO MOVE BACK THERE.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.015
WHAT?

26:22.015 --> 26:24.191
WELL, WHAT ELSE
CAN WE DO?

26:24.191 --> 26:25.540
[SIGHS]

26:25.540 --> 26:28.238
I MEAN, WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE,

26:28.238 --> 26:30.327
AND--AND WE
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY
TO GET A NEW PLACE.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.981
AND HE OFFERED.

26:31.981 --> 26:34.549
AND...AND
NOW HE'S SICK.

26:34.549 --> 26:38.858
THAT'S JUST...
SO NOT WHAT WE PLANNED.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.774
I'M SORRY.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.341
[SIGHS]

26:51.697 --> 26:52.959
AM I INTERRUPTING?

26:54.917 --> 26:56.527
WHAT?

26:56.527 --> 26:57.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:59.095 --> 27:00.619
FILLING OUT
INSURANCE CLAIMS

27:00.619 --> 27:02.969
FOR ALL THE TESTS
WE DID YESTERDAY.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.884
WELL, THAT'S PRETTY
ANNOYING, HUH?

27:04.884 --> 27:06.799
[SIGHS] YEAH.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.758
HOW'S YOUR HIP?

27:11.281 --> 27:12.543
BETTER.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.328
GOOD. GOOD.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.896
THAT BONE MARROW TEST
IS PRETTY HORRIBLE, HUH?

27:22.336 --> 27:24.338
UH, WHAT TIME DO YOU
HAVE TO GO BACK TO, UH...

27:24.338 --> 27:25.774
TO GET YOUR RESULTS?

27:26.906 --> 27:27.863
TOMORROW MORNING.

27:29.996 --> 27:34.000
I DID A LITTLE READING
ON THE WHOLE RADIATION
THING...

27:34.000 --> 27:37.177
AND HOW THEY MAKE
THESE CASTS OF DIFFERENT
PARTS OF YOUR BODY

27:37.177 --> 27:40.223
TO MAKE THESE SHIELDS
TO PROTECT IT
DURING THE RADIATION.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.181
OH.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.575
YOU WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT IT?

27:44.575 --> 27:45.881
NO, CLAUDIA, I DON'T.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.579
OK.

27:49.885 --> 27:50.756
[SOFTLY] OK.

28:00.156 --> 28:02.289
HOW--HOW DID YOU
SLEEP LAST NIGHT?

28:02.289 --> 28:05.335
I MEAN, DID YOU HAVE
ANY OF THOSE
NIGHT SWEATS OR--

28:05.335 --> 28:07.163
CLAUDIA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:07.163 --> 28:08.904
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

28:08.904 --> 28:11.124
WELL, YOU'RE NOT, OK?
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE.

28:11.124 --> 28:14.083
ALL YOUR PICKING
AND YOUR QUESTIONING IS
JUST MAKING IT WORSE.

28:14.083 --> 28:16.172
CHARLIE--ALL YOU WANT TO DO

28:16.172 --> 28:18.131
IS TALK ABOUT MY TESTS
AND MY TREATMENTS
AND MY SYMPTOMS.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.307
IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.657
WELL, IT MAKE ME
FEEL WORSE!

28:22.657 --> 28:25.965
IT JUST--IT JUST
REMINDS ME THAT
I'M SICK, CLAUDIA!

28:25.965 --> 28:29.795
YOUR...MILLION STUPID
LITTLE MEDICAL FACTS.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.579
I'M SORRY.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.712
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO TELL ME THAT I HAVE CANCER.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.930
ALL RIGHT?
I KNOW THAT.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.717
I JUST NEED YOU TO--

28:40.544 --> 28:42.024
[SIGHS HEAVILY]

28:42.024 --> 28:44.026
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I NEED YOU TO DO.

28:44.026 --> 28:46.028
I NEED YOU TO STOP!

28:46.028 --> 28:48.988
JUST GET OUTTA MY FACE
ALL THE TIME.

28:48.988 --> 28:53.253
I PROMISE YOU,
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.733
BUT UNTIL THEN, JUST--

29:31.073 --> 29:33.119
SO I'VE--
I'VE JUST GOTTA--

29:33.119 --> 29:36.339
I'M DRIVING
TO THE POST OFFICE,
AND I JUST HAD TO--

29:36.339 --> 29:39.299
I JUST GOTTA KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,
JULIA, MY FUNERAL?

29:39.299 --> 29:41.040
WHAT?

29:41.040 --> 29:42.650
I CAN'T GET CLAUDIA
TO SHUT UP ABOUT IT,

29:42.650 --> 29:44.957
AND YOU I DON'T
HEAR A WORD FROM! NOTHING!

29:44.957 --> 29:47.524
YOU DON'T EVEN STOP BY!
IT'S LIKE I'M GOING
THROUGH ALL THIS,

29:47.524 --> 29:49.091
AND YOU COULDN'T
CARE LESS!

29:49.091 --> 29:51.137
YOU THINK THAT?
YOU THINK I DON'T CARE?

29:51.137 --> 29:53.574
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO THINK?! WHAT'S
IT TAKE, JULIA?

29:53.574 --> 29:56.142
HOW MUCH EFFORT IS
REQUIRED TO PICK UP
A FREAKIN' PHONE?!

29:56.142 --> 29:58.274
MAYBE IT TAKES,
I DON'T KNOW,
SOME SIGN, SOMETHING,

29:58.274 --> 30:01.843
THAT I'M A PART OF YOUR
LIFE! I MEAN, YOU WANT
ME TO CARE, CHARLIE,

30:01.843 --> 30:03.497
BUT YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME TO KNOW!

30:03.497 --> 30:06.326
BUT...YOU DO KNOW!
NOW YOU KNOW!

30:06.326 --> 30:09.024
BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME!
CLAUDIA DID!

30:09.024 --> 30:12.114
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE
TIME TO PLAY GAMES
WITH YOU, JULIA!

30:12.114 --> 30:15.378
GAMES? YOU ARE THE ONE
PLAYING GAMES, CHARLIE.

30:15.378 --> 30:18.164
YOU'VE LET ME
GO ON AND ON ABOUT MY
STUPID MONEY PROBLEMS.

30:18.164 --> 30:22.081
YOU DON'T INTERRUPT.
YOU DON'T SAY A WORD,
LIKE YOUR HEALTH...

30:22.081 --> 30:25.084
LIKE YOUR CANCER
ISN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH
TO MENTION.

30:25.084 --> 30:28.261
LIKE, HOW COULD JULIA
POSSIBLY CARE ABOUT
ANYTHING BUT HERSELF?

30:28.261 --> 30:32.961
GOD, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO, CHARLIE, EXCEPT
TAKE MY CUE FROM YOU?

30:32.961 --> 30:34.833
IF YOU HAD WANTED
ANYTHING FROM ME,

30:34.833 --> 30:37.400
IF YOU HAD EXPECTED
ANYTHING FROM ME,

30:37.400 --> 30:40.447
YOU WOULD'VE TREATED ME LIKE
YOU THOUGHT I WAS CAPABLE
OF COMING THROUGH FOR YOU.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.884
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
YOU DON'T.

30:42.884 --> 30:45.931
SO CONGRATULATIONS,
CHARLIE. I GUESS
YOU HAD ME PEGGED.

30:47.236 --> 30:48.847
WHAT IS THIS?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.500
WHAT IS YOUR--

30:50.500 --> 30:52.502
GOD. I'M--I'M SICK.
I'M SICK,

30:52.502 --> 30:55.549
AND YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM
WITH--WITH MY PROCESS?!

30:57.029 --> 30:58.639
GET OVER YOURSELF, JULIA!

31:00.946 --> 31:03.339
MAN, I THOUGHT OWEN
WAS THE BABY OF THE FAMILY!

31:13.523 --> 31:17.092
CHARLIE. HEY, MAN,
I WAS WORRIED.
WHERE YOU BEEN?

31:17.092 --> 31:19.181
OUT...
DEALING WITH JULIA.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.183
JUST...DON'T
GET ME STARTED.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.272
WHAT?
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

31:23.272 --> 31:25.318
SOMEHOW JULIA
SEEMS TO THINK

31:25.318 --> 31:27.798
THAT SHE'S
THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON IN ALL THIS.

31:27.798 --> 31:29.409
LIKE...
I'M SICK, YEAH,

31:29.409 --> 31:32.673
BUT THE REAL ISSUE
IS HOW SHE'S TREATED.

31:32.673 --> 31:36.242
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
THAT'S--SHE'S NOT
THAT SELFISH.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.766
YOU WANT TO BET?
"WHY--WHY WAS I
THE LAST TO KNOW?

31:38.766 --> 31:40.986
HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?"

31:40.986 --> 31:43.249
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.815
NO KIDDING.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.992
YOU TALK TO HER.
AT LEAST YOU GET IT.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.646
YEAH, I WILL. HEY.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.648
LISTEN. THE REASON
I CAME BY

31:51.648 --> 31:54.042
IS MY SPONSOR
GAVE ME THIS.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.915
AND...MOST OF IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU,

31:56.915 --> 31:59.613
BUT THERE'S THIS ONE
CHAPTER IN HERE WHERE
THE GUY TALKS ABOUT,

31:59.613 --> 32:03.008
UH, THE HIGHER POWER
STUFF? YOU KNOW,
SURRENDERING YOURSELF--

32:03.008 --> 32:05.053
THE IDEA THAT THERE'S
SOMEBODY LOOKING OUT
FOR YOU.

32:05.053 --> 32:07.099
AND IT IS REALLY
HELPFUL, MAN.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.927
'CAUSE I WAS
WATCHING YOU YESTERDAY

32:08.927 --> 32:10.885
AND HOW HARD
ALL THAT STUFF IS?

32:10.885 --> 32:12.800
AND...I--I KEPT THINKING

32:12.800 --> 32:15.194
HOW ALL OF THIS STUFF
REALLY DOES APPLY.

32:15.194 --> 32:18.066
YOU KNOW? IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT DISEASE YOU HAVE.BAILEY...

32:18.066 --> 32:20.068
OK. I'M SORRY. LOOK,
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT

32:20.068 --> 32:23.071
NEARLY AS WELL
AS THEY DO IN HERE, SO...

32:23.071 --> 32:24.855
I DON'T WANT
THE BOOK, BAILEY.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.857
OK.

32:26.857 --> 32:29.425
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY MORE OF YOUR
AA CRAP. YOU GOT IT?

32:29.425 --> 32:31.819
YEAH. OK, CHARLIE.
IT'S, LIKE...

32:31.819 --> 32:34.213
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
IF YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING NICE,

32:34.213 --> 32:36.867
JUST SAY YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY...
LIKE SARAH DID.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.435
JUST BRING ME
A BANANA BREAD, AND THEN
JUST SHUT THE HELL UP!

32:42.003 --> 32:44.266
OK. LOOK...
I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

32:44.266 --> 32:48.314
UPSET YOU. I--I THOUGHT
THAT THIS MIGHT HELP.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.229
REALLY? WHY IS THAT?
BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND?

32:50.229 --> 32:53.058
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH?
NO. I DIDN'T--

32:53.058 --> 32:56.409
I HAVE A DISEASE, BAILEY!
YOU DON'T HAVE A DISEASE!
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM!

32:56.409 --> 33:00.065
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING!
YOU CAN STOP DRINKING
IF YOU WANT TO.

33:00.065 --> 33:03.024
I CAN'T STOP
HAVING CANCER!

33:03.024 --> 33:06.462
SO IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
BETTER TO TALK WITH ALL
YOUR ALCOHOLIC FRIENDS

33:06.462 --> 33:09.117
ABOUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO HAVE A DISEASE,
THEN GO RIGHT AHEAD!

33:10.858 --> 33:13.252
BUT LEAVE ME OUT OF IT,
ALL RIGHT?!

33:13.252 --> 33:15.906
I'M TELLIN' YOU, MAN,
YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE!

33:33.707 --> 33:36.666
CHARLIE, I CAME
AS SOON AS I GOT YOUR--

33:36.666 --> 33:38.059
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:38.059 --> 33:40.018
THEY JUST--THEY JUST
DON'T GET IT.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.499
NONE OF THEM.
ALL THEY'RE DOING
IS MAKING IT WORSE.

33:43.499 --> 33:44.979
I MEAN, YOU SAW
CLAUDIA, RIGHT?

33:44.979 --> 33:47.547
SHE--SHE WON'T LET UP.

33:47.547 --> 33:48.591
AND JULIA,
CHECK THIS OUT,

33:48.591 --> 33:50.767
SHE'S MAD AT ME.

33:50.767 --> 33:53.944
AND BAILEY. IF I HAVE
TO LISTEN TO ANY MORE
OF HIS A.A. CRAP.

33:53.944 --> 33:56.469
I MEAN, HE'S TRYING
TO BOND WITH ME
OVER OUR DISEASES.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.167
INCREDIBLE, HUH?

33:59.167 --> 34:01.996
I'M SURE HE'S JUST TRYING
TO MAKE SENSE OUT OF THIS
WHOLE THING ANY WAY HE CAN.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.084
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S NOT HELPING.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.999
NONE OF THEM
ARE HELPING.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.096
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE,
KIRSTEN.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.967
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I CAN TALK TO
ABOUT THIS.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.318
OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

34:19.318 --> 34:20.928
NO, I MEAN IT.
YOU ARE.

34:22.538 --> 34:25.237
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE ONLY ONE, CHARLIE.

34:25.237 --> 34:28.196
'CAUSE WHAT HAPPENS
ONE DAY WHEN I SAY
THE WRONG THING

34:28.196 --> 34:30.981
OR--OR IF I DISAPPOINT YOU
IN SOME WAY?

34:32.374 --> 34:33.984
COME ON, YOU WON'T.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.856
YES, I WILL, CHARLIE.

34:35.856 --> 34:39.251
AND I'M SCARED BECAUSE
IF I'M THE ONLY ONE, THEN--

34:42.080 --> 34:45.387
I'VE GOT TO WATCH
EVERYTHING THAT I SAY
AND EVERYTHING THAT I DO.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.998
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET
EVERYTHING EXACTLY RIGHT.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.131
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

34:50.131 --> 34:51.524
YOU--YOU'RE GREAT,
KIRSTEN.

34:51.524 --> 34:52.960
YOU'RE EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.614
I MEAN, IF IT WASN'T
FOR YOU, I--

34:54.614 --> 34:57.269
CHARLIE, I HEAR WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT THEM.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.227
AND IT'S LIKE
I'M NEXT IN LINE

34:59.227 --> 35:02.100
TO MAKE THE SAME
KINDS OF MISTAKES
THAT THEY'RE MAKING.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.884
I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA
CALL YOU TOO MUCH

35:03.884 --> 35:07.061
OR I'M NOT GOING
TO CALL YOU ENOUGH.

35:07.061 --> 35:10.064
OR YOU'RE GOING
TO GET INSULTED BY
SOME ANALOGY THAT I MAKE

35:10.064 --> 35:12.110
TO SOME EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE IT.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.807
THAT IS NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.809
WOULD YOU JUST LISTEN
TO ME, CHARLIE, PLEASE?

35:15.809 --> 35:18.333
I AM TELLING YOU
IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.162
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

35:21.162 --> 35:23.033
I MEAN, I CAN'T--

35:23.033 --> 35:26.428
I CAN'T WORRY
ABOUT YOU WORRYING
ABOUT ME, OK?

35:26.428 --> 35:28.865
I MEAN, I'M SICK,
KIRSTEN. I GOT
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.302
ANYTHING ELSE
IS TOO MUCH.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.173
I CAN'T--I CAN'T
TAKE THAT ON.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.916
I THINK YOU HAVE TO.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.439
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT,
CHARLIE?

35:37.439 --> 35:39.398
IF YOU DON'T,
THEN SOONER OR LATER,

35:39.398 --> 35:42.444
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
GOING THROUGH THIS
ALL ALONE.

35:56.545 --> 35:57.546
HEY.

35:59.113 --> 36:01.289
RAIN.

36:01.289 --> 36:04.814
PROBABLY BE GETTING
A LOT OF LEAKY ROOF CALLS.

36:04.814 --> 36:08.383
THAT'S SORT OF
THE LAST THING
YOU NEED RIGHT NOW, HUH?

36:08.383 --> 36:10.255
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'LL DEAL WITH IT.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.910
SO, DO YOU NEED A LIFT
OVER TO THE HOUSE
THIS MORNING

36:13.910 --> 36:15.042
OR IS ANNIE GONNA?

36:15.042 --> 36:16.565
WHY?

36:16.565 --> 36:17.740
DID YOU HAVE SOME
MORE BAKED GOODS

36:17.740 --> 36:19.612
YOU WANTED
TO BRING BY?

36:19.612 --> 36:21.048
WHAT?

36:21.048 --> 36:23.093
I MEAN, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING, SARAH?

36:23.093 --> 36:25.008
BANANA BREAD?

36:25.008 --> 36:26.532
IT WAS A GESTURE.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.229
YEAH, WELL,
IT WAS STUPID.

36:29.404 --> 36:30.579
CHARLIE SAID THAT?

36:30.579 --> 36:32.538
MAYBE IT MADE YOU
FEEL GOOD.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.496
LIKE YOU GOT CREDIT
FOR BEING CONSCIENTIOUS
OR SOMETHING,

36:34.496 --> 36:36.455
BUT HE'S
GOT CANCER, SARAH.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.544
SO HE DOESN'T NEED TO BE
BURDENED WITH YOU'

36:38.544 --> 36:41.895
IMPOSING YOUR, LIKE,
YOU'RE PERSONAL AGENDA
ON HIS SITUATION.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.854
MY AGENDA TO DELIVER
BANANA BREAD?

36:44.854 --> 36:48.031
AND IF IT WAS YOUR
INTENTION TO SHOW ME UP,

36:48.031 --> 36:50.947
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
I WAS OVER THE TOP
OR SOMETHING,

36:50.947 --> 36:52.688
IN COMPARISON
TO YOUR STUPID
LITTLE BANANA BREAD,

36:52.688 --> 36:54.037
THAT'S TOO MUCH?

36:54.037 --> 36:56.431
WELL, HEY,
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.177
OK.

37:04.831 --> 37:08.922
WHAT ELSE?WHAT ELSE?

37:08.922 --> 37:11.968
YEAH. WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT
TO YELL AT ME ABOUT?

37:11.968 --> 37:15.494
'CAUSE IF THIS
HELPS YOU, YOU KNOW,
TO BE ANGRY

37:15.494 --> 37:19.019
AND SCREAM ABOUT HOW
UNFAIR ALL THIS IS,

37:19.019 --> 37:21.064
HOW HELPLESS
YOU FEEL.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.719
HOW HELPLESS
YOU ARE.

37:23.719 --> 37:26.244
WELL, THEN, THAT'S
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.116
SO, GO AHEAD,
I CAN TAKE IT.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.057
IT'S BAD.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.537
NOT AS BAD
AS WE FEARED,

37:58.537 --> 38:00.234
BUT NOT AS GOOD
AS WE HOPED.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.629
OH.

38:05.021 --> 38:08.242
MR. SALINGER.
CHARLIE.

38:08.242 --> 38:11.376
WOULD YOU LIKE TO INCLUDE
A FAMILY MEMBER
IN THIS DISCUSSION?

38:12.551 --> 38:14.117
YOU SURE?

38:14.117 --> 38:15.989
IT CAN REALLY HELP
TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE HERE.

38:15.989 --> 38:19.079
SO IT--IT SPREAD.
THE CANCER.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.255
IT'S IN A NUMBER
OF LYMPH NODES, YES,

38:21.255 --> 38:25.433
BUT ALL OF THEM
ABOVE THE DIAPHRAGM,
WHICH IS GOOD NEWS.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.914
WE CALL THIS HODGKIN'S
STAGE 2A.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.699
AND WE TREAT IT WITH
A 6-WEEK COURSE
OF RADIATION.

38:32.701 --> 38:36.966
NOW, IS DR. DEVLIN
THE RADIOLOGIST
YOU'VE CHOSEN?

38:38.141 --> 38:40.709
I GUESS.

38:40.709 --> 38:43.321
MY OFFICE WILL HELP COORDINATE
THE INITIAL CONSULTATION,

38:43.321 --> 38:45.714
BUT I SUGGEST YOU
SIMULTANEOUSLY SET UP

38:45.714 --> 38:47.020
A REGULAR TIME
FOR TREATMENTS.

38:53.853 --> 38:57.422
WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW
THE RECOVERY STATISTICS?

38:57.422 --> 38:59.424
SOME PEOPLE
ARE COMFORTED
BY THE NUMBERS.

38:59.424 --> 39:02.165
OTHERS FIND THEM, WELL,
COUNTER PRODUCTIVE.

39:02.165 --> 39:05.560
I KNOW THE STATISTICS.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.127
I'M GOING TO CHECK
WITH MY NURSE

39:07.127 --> 39:08.868
ABOUT SETTING UP
THOSE SESSIONS
WITH DEVLIN.

39:08.868 --> 39:10.435
HE BOOKS UP FAST.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.006
WHY DON'T I ASK
WHOEVER CAME
WITH YOU TO STEP IN?

39:17.006 --> 39:19.008
THIS COULD BE A LOT
TO TAKE IN AT ONCE.

39:19.008 --> 39:22.838
NO, IT'S, UM,
I'M--I'M HERE ALONE,

39:22.838 --> 39:24.623
BUT IT'S OK.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.117
WELL, IT'S A ROOF
OVER OUR HEAD.

39:41.117 --> 39:42.858
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

39:42.858 --> 39:45.339
WELL, WE COULD
PUT A MATTRESS
IN THE LOFT.

39:45.339 --> 39:47.210
THERE'S NO BATHROOM.

39:47.210 --> 39:50.170
WELL, IF WE NEED
TO GO, WE CAN JUST
RUN INTO THE HOUSE.

39:51.737 --> 39:53.652
LOOK...

39:53.652 --> 39:57.003
I THINK MAYBE THE ATTIC
WOULD WORK BETTER.

39:57.003 --> 40:00.615
NO, I DON'T WANT--

40:00.615 --> 40:03.313
GRIFFIN, THIS WAY,
IT'S KIND OF LIKE US
LIVING WITH MY FAMILY,

40:03.313 --> 40:05.794
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
HAVING OUR OWN PLACE.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.843
LOOK, I JUST--
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
WITH MY NEW HUSBAND

40:10.843 --> 40:12.497
IN MY OLD BEDROOM.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.762
OK?

40:16.762 --> 40:18.851
YEAH, MAYBE WITH
A NEW COAT OF PAINT.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.817
YOU KNOW THERE'LL
BE TIMES WHEN I NEED
TO STAY OVER THERE.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.079
YOU KNOW, IN THE HOUSE.

40:30.079 --> 40:32.821
FOR OWEN AND CLAUD AND--

40:33.953 --> 40:35.694
AND FOR HIM.

40:35.694 --> 40:38.436
WHEN HE'S REALLY SICK.
WHEN HE NEEDS MY HELP.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.656
WELL, I'LL BRING
MY PILLOW.

40:56.366 --> 40:58.499
HEY, WHEN DID YOU--

40:58.499 --> 41:01.502
ABOUT 10 MINUTES AGO.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.939
CLAUDIA'S BEEN FILLING
ME IN ON EVERYTHING.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.202
I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL
WHAT YOU'RE DOING, JULE.

41:06.202 --> 41:09.249
AND IF YOU NEED ME
TO COME HOME FOR AWHILE

41:09.249 --> 41:11.033
AND HELP OUT WITH
ANYTHING, I CAN.

41:11.033 --> 41:15.560
NO, THAT'S--
NO, I'M FINE.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.953
WE'RE FINE.

41:17.953 --> 41:19.389
[SIGHS]

41:19.389 --> 41:21.348
SO WHERE IS HE?

41:21.348 --> 41:25.091
HE, UH, HE WENT TO GET
THE RESULTS OF HIS TESTS
AND EVERYTHING.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.832
WITH KIRSTEN?

41:26.832 --> 41:28.616
NO. I THINK HE KIND OF
BLEW HER OFF, TOO.

41:29.878 --> 41:32.054
GOD!

41:32.054 --> 41:34.404
SO EVERYONE'S
MAD AT HIM, HUH?

41:34.404 --> 41:36.058
NO KIDDING.

41:36.058 --> 41:37.886
MAN, WHAT IS
HIS PROBLEM?

41:40.149 --> 41:41.716
HE'S SICK.

41:42.848 --> 41:45.764
AND HE'S SCARED,

41:45.764 --> 41:48.767
AND HE'S ANGRY, AND
HE HAS NO IDEA HOW
TO HANDLE ANY OF IT.

41:50.986 --> 41:55.034
DOES THIS MEAN
WE HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH ALL HIS CRAP?

41:55.034 --> 41:57.776
WELL, HE PUT UP
WITH OURS,
DIDN'T HE?

42:01.214 --> 42:04.913
OK, THEN,
SO WE TAKE IT.

42:04.913 --> 42:07.046
WHATEVER HE SAYS,
WHATEVER HE DOES,

42:07.046 --> 42:09.004
NO MATTER HOW BAD IT GETS,
WE TAKE IT.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.571
RIGHT.

42:11.877 --> 42:14.749
AND IF IT GETS
REALLY BAD,

42:14.749 --> 42:16.969
THEN WE COMPLAIN
TO EACH OTHER.

42:16.969 --> 42:20.929
BUT WE DON'T EVER COMPLAIN
TO HIM. DEAL?

42:20.929 --> 42:22.322
MM-HMM.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.891
DEAL.

42:25.891 --> 42:27.762
OK.

42:33.115 --> 42:35.335
CHARLIE.

42:35.335 --> 42:38.120
DIDN'T HEAR YOU
COME IN.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.035
WHAT ARE YOU ALL
DOING HERE?

42:40.035 --> 42:41.123
TALKING ABOUT ME?

42:41.123 --> 42:42.298
NO, WE WERE JUST--

42:42.298 --> 42:43.386
WE'RE JUST HANGING OUT.

42:45.040 --> 42:49.044
SO, YOU OK?

42:49.044 --> 42:50.872
YOU WANT TO TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

42:50.872 --> 42:53.571
OR, I MEAN, IF YOU NEED
SOME TIME ALONE,

42:53.571 --> 42:55.355
WE CAN JUST--
DO YOU WANT US TO GO?

42:55.355 --> 43:00.360
NO, DON'T.
I WANT--

43:08.194 --> 43:10.544
[SIGHS]

43:10.544 --> 43:13.373
I HAVE A LOT
OF NEW THINGS
TO DEAL WITH.

43:13.373 --> 43:17.116
ALL AT ONCE AND IT'S--

43:17.116 --> 43:21.294
IT'S, LIKE, TOO MUCH
TO GET RIGHT ALL AT ONCE.

43:21.294 --> 43:24.079
AND, UH,

43:24.079 --> 43:27.779
I THINK I GOT IT WRONG
THE FIRST TIME.

43:27.779 --> 43:31.826
SO, I'M SAYING--

43:33.262 --> 43:35.351
I'M SORRY.

43:37.876 --> 43:41.053
AND I WANNA START OVER
WITH ALL OF YOU.

43:41.053 --> 43:44.186
JUST TELL YOU EVERYTHING
THAT I KNOW.

43:44.186 --> 43:46.841
WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO ME.

43:48.495 --> 43:52.412
AND, UM,
AND WHAT I NEED.

43:52.412 --> 43:54.022
JUST FROM THE BEGINNING.

44:07.383 --> 44:09.385
I HAVE CANCER.

44:09.385 --> 44:12.998
UM, HODGKIN'S DISEASE,
STAGE 2, ACTUALLY,

44:12.998 --> 44:15.696
WHICH I JUST
FOUND OUT. AND, UH--
