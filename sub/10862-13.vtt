- Oh, man, not again. 
 - Sorry, pal.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.560
You lose. 
 You're it.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.680
But I was just it 
 three times.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.120
[Scoffs] 
 Too bad.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.440
I'll be it.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.040
Why don't we just tell 
 the story?

00:51.040 --> 00:54.080
Why are we playing 
 this dumb kids' game, anyway?

00:54.080 --> 00:56.240
- Who's going tonight? 
 - I am.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.600
And it's not 
 a dumb kids' game.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.160
I wanted us to play 
 hide-and-seek

01:06.160 --> 01:07.320
to get in the mood 
 for my story.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.360
How's a game gonna get us 
 in the mood for a scary tale?

01:10.360 --> 01:13.960
Because hide-and-seek is not 
 like any other game.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.880
You start off in a group,

01:15.880 --> 01:17.840
but when you're out there 
 in the dark,

01:17.840 --> 01:20.200
you're all alone.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.760
You got to hide 
 and be real quiet,

01:22.760 --> 01:24.040
'cause you never know

01:24.040 --> 01:26.640
when somebody might jump out 
 and catch you.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.800
[Wolf howls in distance]

01:33.440 --> 01:36.280
My story is about a game 
 of hide-and-seek

01:36.280 --> 01:37.920
but with a twist.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.320
When you play the game 
 in my story,

01:40.320 --> 01:43.560
you never know when 
 you'll get caught.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.520
And you never know who or what 
 might catch you.

01:48.520 --> 01:53.160
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:53.160 --> 01:56.080
I call this story...

02:02.080 --> 02:04.600
Jack and Kenny Harris just 
 moved into the neighborhood

02:04.600 --> 02:06.600
and hadn't made 
 many friends yet.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.000
It's never easy being 
 the new kids on the block.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.760
You'll do almost anything 
 to fit in.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.400
But Jack and Kenny are 
 about to find out that

02:15.400 --> 02:18.480
that's not always 
 such a good idea.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.440
- You're dead! 
 - [Laughing]

03:01.920 --> 03:04.120
- Jack! 
 - Say "uncle"!

03:04.120 --> 03:05.960
- Jack, look! 
 - Say it!

03:05.960 --> 03:07.200
Jack!

03:09.080 --> 03:10.920
What's up?

03:10.920 --> 03:13.360
- What do you want? 
 - Jack.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.840
I want to say hello.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.960
Hey, I'm Kenny. 
 This is my brother, Jack.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.000
I saw you guys moving in 
 last week.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.360
- Where are you from? 
 - East side.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.640
East side? 
 [Scoffs]

03:21.640 --> 03:23.120
Nice neighborhood.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.760
- Toughest in the city. 
 - Yeah, that's why we moved.

03:25.760 --> 03:27.320
So you guys like it here?

03:27.320 --> 03:29.640
I don't know; it's kind of 
 a loser neighborhood.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.320
It is not. 
 We like it a lot better here.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.880
You guys made 
 any friends yet?

03:34.880 --> 03:38.360
Well, if you want, 
 you see those guys over there?

03:38.360 --> 03:39.560
Yeah.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.920
We get together 
 every once in a while

03:40.920 --> 03:42.440
For a game of hide-and-seek.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.480
We're playing tonight, 
 if you guys want to come.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.600
- Uh, I don't think so. 
 - Why not?

03:47.600 --> 03:49.440
Well, it's just 
 a stupid kids game.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.000
That's okay.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.760
You guys are probably too afraid 
 to play where we do, anyway.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.960
Where do you play?

03:54.960 --> 03:57.720
End of anchor street, 
 behind the big gates.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.960
Why do you say we'd be 
 too afraid to play there?

03:59.960 --> 04:02.400
[Chuckles] 
 Let's just say...

04:02.400 --> 04:04.440
It gets pretty dark in there 
 at night.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.360
Yeah, well, we're not chicken, 
 are we, Kenny?

04:07.360 --> 04:09.360
[Scoffs] 
 No.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.440
Meet us there at sunset,

04:11.440 --> 04:14.720
unless you're afraid.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.240
What does he mean 
 "unless you're afraid"?

04:22.240 --> 04:24.720
I don't know. 
 It's a kids' game, right?

04:24.720 --> 04:26.840
What's so scary 
 about hide-and-seek?

04:36.960 --> 04:39.840
- You're kidding, right? 
 - Come on, let's go.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.200
We're going in there?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.280
You're the one who wanted 
 to make friends, remember?

04:43.280 --> 04:45.280
Let's go!

- Hey! 
 - [Gasps]

05:15.000 --> 05:16.080

Where are they?

05:36.200 --> 05:37.560
Boo!

05:37.560 --> 05:40.640
Oh, man, you should've seen 
 your faces.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.320
You're a comic genius. 
 Where is everybody?

05:43.320 --> 05:46.400
Out in the graveyard. 
 We didn't think you'd show.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.240
Now we're gonna 
 have to start over.

How you doing?

06:07.480 --> 06:08.200
Hi.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.720
That's Ron Jacobson, 
 Scott Walden,

06:17.720 --> 06:21.480
Laura Ires, Mary-Alice Weirden, 
 and Cissy Vernon.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.960
Cissy?

06:22.960 --> 06:25.000
Just call me Vernon.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.760
What are they doing here?

06:26.760 --> 06:28.120
I invited them.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.320
We got enough people 
 in the group.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.520
We don't need any more.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.320
Sure we do. 
 The more, the better.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.440
Hope you don't scare easy.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.000
What's there 
 to be scared about?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.560
It's just a graveyard. 
 Everyone's dead here.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.200
- Well, kinda. 
 - What are you talking about?

06:43.200 --> 06:45.400
You didn't tell them 
 the legend of Old Man Corcoran?

06:45.400 --> 06:46.760
The legend of who?

06:46.760 --> 06:51.720
Old Man Corcoran. 
 He was a groundskeeper here.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.600
He used to dig the graves 
 by hand.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.360
No machinery.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.160
He thought he owned the place.

06:58.160 --> 07:02.640
So he'd walk around at night 
 all by himself,

07:02.640 --> 07:06.760
just to make sure 
 no one was trespassing.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.360
If he wasn't here, he'd be out 
 in the woods by his cabin,

07:10.360 --> 07:12.440
just playing his harmonica.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.240
That's not much of a legend.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.360
[laughing] 
 Oh, it gets better.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.720
They say he was crazy.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.240
They say he caught this kid 
 stealing something

07:22.240 --> 07:23.800
from his shack,

07:23.800 --> 07:26.000
so he took an ax

07:26.000 --> 07:27.280
and cut his hand off!

07:27.280 --> 07:28.520
Wham!

07:32.680 --> 07:36.160
One day, 
 he was digging a grave

07:36.160 --> 07:38.240
when all of a sudden,

07:38.240 --> 07:41.200
the sides caved in on him.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.040
He was buried alive.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.840
Gross.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.000
Some say he still walks 
 the graveyard at night,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.640
looking for trespassers.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.120
And if it's real quiet,

07:57.120 --> 08:00.600
you might even hear him 
 playing his harmonica

08:00.600 --> 08:03.480
off in the distance.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.960
You call that scary?

08:04.960 --> 08:07.600
Shoot, my grandma's scarier 
 than that.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.320
Yeah, you should try living 
 in our old neighborhood.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.920
Now, that's scary.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.320
Yeah, I'd like to see how long 
 you'd last in there, Vermin.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.040
- That's Vernon. 
 - Whatever.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.640
Old Man Corcoran's out there.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.280
I'll believe it 
 when I see it.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.560
Are we gonna play 
 or stand around talking?

08:24.560 --> 08:28.680
We're gonna play, 
 all of us.

 is out-of-bounds.

 it's Old Man Corcoran?

12:56.680 --> 12:58.240
Tonight? Again?

12:58.240 --> 13:01.080
Well, you didn't get 
 to finish the game last night.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.880
Uh... I don't think 
 we're up to it.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.200
- Why not? 
 - We just aren't.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.360
I told you they were chicken.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.600
We're not!

13:10.600 --> 13:13.000
Vern just told you that story 
 to scare you.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.880
She doesn't want anyone else 
 joining the group.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.880
I thought you said 
 you weren't afraid of ghosts?

13:17.880 --> 13:20.000
I said I'd believe it 
 when I see it, and I saw it.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.560
You didn't see anything.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.800
They told you a story,

13:22.800 --> 13:24.640
and your mind filled in 
 the rest.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.240
No, we saw 
 Old Man Corcoran.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.080
[Laughing] 
 Sure, you did.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.880
[Clucks mockingly]

13:29.880 --> 13:32.720
That's enough. 
 We'll be there tonight.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.360
Great. 
 See you there.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.440
Jack, I don't want to make 
 friends that bad.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.320
This isn't about making 
 friends anymore, Kenny.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.160
We got to prove 
 we can handle it here.

13:45.160 --> 13:49.760
We're gonna play their game.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.880
- Man, let's play already. 
 - Yeah, they're not coming.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.680
They'll be here.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.840
What's the big deal

13:55.840 --> 13:57.240
about letting them 
 in the group, anyway?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.800
I'm tired of the same people 
 all the time.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.480
We haven't had 
 any new players since...

14:02.480 --> 14:03.720
Since I joined?

14:03.720 --> 14:06.320
And you said after me, 
 there wasn't gonna be any more.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.680
Guess he was wrong.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.840
You guys got more guts 
 than I thought.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.400
Aren't you afraid Old Man 
 Corcoran's gonna get you?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.400
Shut up about 
 that stupid story!

14:16.400 --> 14:19.440
There's no such thing 
 as Old Man Corcoran.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.960
Now let's play.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.960
- You're both it. 
 - How do you figure that?

14:23.960 --> 14:25.720
You left the game early 
 last night,

14:25.720 --> 14:28.000
and since you wimps 
 are so scared,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.760
you can be it together.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.600
Yeah, why don't you babies 
 hold hands?

14:31.600 --> 14:33.480
[Laughter]

14:33.480 --> 14:36.480
[Owl hooting]

14:38.480 --> 14:43.320
Both: One, two, three, four--

14:43.320 --> 14:45.120
You think it's gonna be 
 like this all the time?

14:45.120 --> 14:47.840
- five, six, seven,

14:47.840 --> 14:49.440
eight, nine--

14:49.440 --> 14:51.080
I just want to make 
 some friends.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.840
- ten. 
 Let's go.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.120
[suspenseful music]

15:43.800 --> 15:46.840
[Wind blowing]

15:49.800 --> 15:54.200
This is stupid. 
 We're never gonna get anybody.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.440
[Harmonica playing]

15:55.440 --> 15:57.520
Listen. 
 Hear that?

15:57.520 --> 15:59.840
- No. 
 - It's Old Man Corcoran.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.800
- Come on! 
 - [Sighs] Man.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.640
[Sighs heavily]

16:06.640 --> 16:09.360
[Harmonica playing]

16:12.360 --> 16:13.840
Hey, why don't we get 
 the others

16:13.840 --> 16:15.280
and all go in together?

16:15.280 --> 16:17.440
No; by the time we get back, 
 he'll be gone.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.480
Old Man Corcoran's out there, 
 and we're gonna prove it.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.760
How?

16:20.760 --> 16:22.640
We're gonna steal 
 his harmonica.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.800
[ax chopping]

16:35.600 --> 16:38.560
[ax chopping continues]

16:41.720 --> 16:44.560
[Bizarre string music]

16:56.920 --> 16:59.920
[Whispers] 
 There it is!

17:06.280 --> 17:09.319
[Tense music]

17:11.800 --> 17:12.720
[Rustling]

17:12.720 --> 17:14.599
[Grunts]

17:18.160 --> 17:21.040
- Let's get out of here. 
 - Not yet.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.960
[Dramatic music crescendo]

17:28.119 --> 17:29.880
Thwack!

17:37.240 --> 17:40.840
[Playing harmonica]

17:40.840 --> 17:42.880
[Door creaking]

17:42.880 --> 17:44.160
[Door slams shut]

17:44.160 --> 17:47.560
- That was close. 
 - Yeah, he almost saw us.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.880
No, I mean we were so close 
 to getting the harmonica.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.680
Now we're gonna have 
 to go get it.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.720
We don't need 
 the harmonica.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.080
Let's just get the others 
 out here to see him.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.120
[Sighs]

17:58.120 --> 18:02.320
- Where are you going? 
 - To get the others.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.040
Get back here!

18:07.160 --> 18:08.800
Chicken.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.320
I'll get it myself.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.600
[Sighs]

18:11.600 --> 18:14.720
If I die, it's his fault.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.880
[Suspenseful music]

18:38.600 --> 18:41.480
[Wolf howling in distance]

18:59.720 --> 19:01.120
Hello?

19:02.560 --> 19:04.320
Hello?

19:09.360 --> 19:12.440
[Foreboding music]

19:27.840 --> 19:29.440
Hey!

19:29.440 --> 19:30.480
Oh, great.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.000
[Door creaking]

19:33.000 --> 19:36.080
Hey! 
 [Sighs]

19:42.320 --> 19:45.400
[Distorted music playing]

19:55.240 --> 19:57.000
[Both scream]

19:57.000 --> 19:59.880
What are you doing here? 
 I got scared.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.440
But look what I found.

20:01.440 --> 20:04.720
Now we've got proof. 
 Now they have to believe us.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.880
Yeah, give me 
 the flashlight.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.280
I'm not holding 
 the flashlight.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.960
Well, I'm not holding 
 the flashlight.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.200
Jack?

20:14.440 --> 20:17.400
Give me my harmonica.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.520
[Both screaming]

20:28.520 --> 20:30.560
[Grunting]

[Both screaming]

20:37.000 --> 20:38.600
Thud!

20:38.600 --> 20:40.600
- You okay? 
 - Yeah.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.680
Get out of here. 
 I was here first.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.520
Vern, shut up and listen. 
 We saw Old Man Corcoran again.

20:45.520 --> 20:46.800
He's up there, 
 and he's after us.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.400
I stole his harmonica.

20:48.400 --> 20:52.000
- I don't want you here! 
 - Did you hear what I just said?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.840
- Get out of here! 
 - Make me!

20:54.840 --> 20:56.560
Aw, come on, 
 let's go, Jack.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.480
I don't like being 
 in here, anyway.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.400
Hurry up.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.800
We're leaving.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.720
Go find your own grave.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.840
Sorry. 
 Didn't see your name on it.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.680
Well, look a little closer 
 next time.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.200
Hi, guys. 
 [Both gasp]

21:30.200 --> 21:32.360
Sorry. 
 Didn't mean to scare you.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.480
Man, you got to get 
 out of here.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.560
Jack stole Old Man Corcoran's 
 harmonica, and he's been--

21:36.560 --> 21:40.120
Guys, the Old Man Corcoran 
 stories are getting old.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.240
We're playing a game here.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.880
Come on, get in. 
 It's a great hiding place.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.400
Man, will you forget 
 about the stupid game?

21:47.400 --> 21:50.800
Don't you want to play? 
 They can never find you in here.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.760
Come on.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.080
[Gasps]

21:58.080 --> 22:00.120
What are you doing here?

22:00.120 --> 22:03.000
We... we were playing 
 hide-and-seek.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.040
In a graveyard?

22:06.040 --> 22:08.120
Just the two of you?

22:08.120 --> 22:12.560
No, with our friends.

22:12.560 --> 22:19.440
Cissy Vernon, Ron Jacobson, 
 Marshal McClain.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.160
That ain't very funny.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.800
All those kids 
 are dead and buried.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.200
I dug the graves myself.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.520
[Creepy organ music]

22:33.120 --> 22:35.440
What's wrong with you two?

22:35.440 --> 22:38.320
You look like 
 you seen a ghost.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.880
[Dramatic music]

22:51.360 --> 22:53.520
The end.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.840
So does anyone want to play 
 the dumb kids' game again?

22:59.800 --> 23:00.840
Not it.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.200
- Not it. 
 - Not it!

23:02.200 --> 23:03.240
- Not it. 
 - Not--

23:03.240 --> 23:04.360
You're it.

23:04.360 --> 23:05.960

Ha! Goof!
