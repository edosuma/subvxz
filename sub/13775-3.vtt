WEBVTT

00:03.684 --> 00:05.524
You ever have one
of those weekends where all

00:05.525 --> 00:06.285
you do is have sex?

00:06.287 --> 00:07.987
Yeah, yeah.

00:07.989 --> 00:10.417
Well, last night I was so
sick of it that I had to

00:10.418 --> 00:12.658
fantasize about <i>not</i> having
sex just to get an erection.

00:12.660 --> 00:14.659
You guys know what I'm
talking about, right?

00:14.661 --> 00:15.660
Yeah, of course.

00:15.662 --> 00:16.494
Of course.

00:16.496 --> 00:18.630
Guys, you have no idea
what he's talking about.

00:18.632 --> 00:21.232
I guarantee none of you ever
had a weekend like that.

00:21.234 --> 00:24.069
What's the most you've had sex in one day?

00:24.071 --> 00:25.303
I... I... Th-Three?

00:25.305 --> 00:27.305
Yeah, I-I max out at three, too.

00:27.307 --> 00:29.307
Does masturbation count?

00:29.309 --> 00:29.908
No.

00:29.910 --> 00:30.909
It's a sexual act.

00:30.911 --> 00:33.071
Just out of curiosity, Andre,
how many times have you

00:33.072 --> 00:33.992
masturbated in one day?

00:33.993 --> 00:34.913
Twelve.

00:34.915 --> 00:35.547
What?!

00:35.549 --> 00:36.548
What?!

00:36.550 --> 00:39.819
Well, okay, look, I took Cialis,
and I was supposed to meet a date.

00:39.821 --> 00:43.022
She never showed up, so I just
had to, you know, ride it out.

00:43.024 --> 00:44.304
It was the craziest brunch ever.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.024
Jenny.

00:45.026 --> 00:46.026
What?

00:46.028 --> 00:48.028
How many times have you had sex in a day?

00:48.030 --> 00:49.329
I'm not gonna tell you that.

00:49.331 --> 00:50.731
'Scuse <i>you,</i> sir.

00:50.733 --> 00:51.732
Come on, Jenny!

00:51.734 --> 00:52.366
Tell us.

00:53.703 --> 00:56.003
Tell us, Jenny.

00:56.005 --> 00:57.538
Fine. Five.

00:57.540 --> 00:58.572
Really?

00:58.574 --> 01:01.508
Five. Kev! Holding out on us.

01:01.510 --> 01:02.576
Nice, buddy! Nice work.

01:02.578 --> 01:04.378
It wasn't with Kevin.

01:08.117 --> 01:09.384
Kev-bo, don't worry about it.

01:09.386 --> 01:10.385
You can top that.

01:10.387 --> 01:13.121
Just slap some Drakkar on, get
yourself a box of wine, and then

01:13.123 --> 01:15.089
pound away on little Petey
until he calls uncle.

01:15.091 --> 01:16.123
Uncle!

01:16.125 --> 01:17.458
Too late.

01:22.697 --> 01:23.631
This place is nice.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.299
Yeah, I take all my clients here.

01:25.301 --> 01:26.421
It's, like, authentic sushi.

01:26.422 --> 01:27.968
It's got a terrible name, though.

01:27.970 --> 01:28.969
Spooky Sushi?

01:28.971 --> 01:31.731
I don't know what's so appetizing
about the thought of haunted fish.

01:31.732 --> 01:34.640
Yeah, there are a few Japanese
restaurants that I've been haunted by.

01:34.642 --> 01:35.641
Bad sashimi?

01:35.643 --> 01:36.642
No, miso soup.

01:36.644 --> 01:38.645
It just makes me spray
sour water... ugh.

01:38.647 --> 01:39.979
I will seat you at sushi bar.

01:39.981 --> 01:40.980
Okay, great.

01:41.983 --> 01:42.649
Okay.

01:42.651 --> 01:45.217
Thank you.

01:45.219 --> 01:46.052
I'm starving.

01:46.054 --> 01:46.752
Yeah.

01:46.754 --> 01:47.753
I'm sick.

01:47.755 --> 01:48.721
This place is delish.

01:49.724 --> 01:50.723
Hey, how are you?

01:50.725 --> 01:54.060
I could eat here, like, five times a day.

01:54.062 --> 01:56.296
You're such a dick, Ruxin.

01:57.466 --> 01:58.832
What's up, dudes?

01:58.834 --> 02:01.001
So, what can I do for you guys?

02:01.003 --> 02:02.136
<i>Omakase?</i>

02:02.138 --> 02:04.438
<i>That's the chef's choice.</i>

02:04.440 --> 02:05.606
<i>This chef?</i>

02:05.608 --> 02:07.575
<i>You will not be disappointed,</i>

02:07.577 --> 02:09.009
<i>I'll tell you that right now.</i>

02:09.012 --> 02:10.912
<i>I selected the fish myself.</i>

02:10.913 --> 02:11.913
<i>Really?</i>

02:11.915 --> 02:13.115
<i>I'll tell you guys something.</i>

02:13.117 --> 02:15.417
<i>Japanese chefs, we don't like to</i>

02:15.419 --> 02:17.353
<i>brag, but I got a knack for</i>

02:17.355 --> 02:19.322
<i>selecting the right fish
for the right people.</i>

02:19.324 --> 02:20.356
<i>You know how I do it?</i>

02:20.358 --> 02:21.457
<i>I pick up on your vibe.</i>

02:21.459 --> 02:23.326
<i>I just get your energy.</i>

02:27.164 --> 02:28.864
<i>I paint a portrait of you two</i>

02:28.866 --> 02:31.199
<i>dudes with, like... fish.</i>

02:31.201 --> 02:33.635
<i>Cool.</i>

02:33.637 --> 02:34.703
<i>Excuse me.</i>

02:34.705 --> 02:35.371
<i>Yes?</i>

02:35.373 --> 02:36.472
<i>Is there another table?</i>

02:36.474 --> 02:37.472
<i>'Cause we're very cold.</i>

02:37.474 --> 02:38.540
<i>Cold?</i>

02:38.542 --> 02:39.775
<i>Brr!</i>

02:39.777 --> 02:41.176
<i>It's not cold.</i>

02:41.178 --> 02:43.545
<i>No, there's no other table.</i>

02:43.547 --> 02:44.713
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:47.117 --> 02:49.385
<i>So, you've been a sushi chef for a while?</i>

02:49.387 --> 02:50.653
<i>14 years.</i>

02:50.655 --> 02:52.054
<i>Studied a year and a half in</i>

02:52.056 --> 02:53.956
<i>Japan, where my master, Kenji</i>

02:53.958 --> 02:55.791
<i>Nakamaro, says, "Wesley-san,</i>

02:55.793 --> 02:58.460
<i>your hands make poetry of fish."</i>

02:58.462 --> 02:59.502
<i>And then I moved out here.</i>

02:59.503 --> 03:00.462
<i>Wesley-san?</i>

03:00.464 --> 03:01.463
<i>Hai.</i>

03:01.465 --> 03:02.497
<i>Where are you from?</i>

03:02.499 --> 03:03.665
<i>I grew up in O-ma-ha.</i>

03:03.667 --> 03:04.666
<i>Where's that?</i>

03:04.668 --> 03:08.169
<i>It's in, like, Nebraska.</i>

03:08.171 --> 03:09.170
<i>Omaha.</i>

03:09.172 --> 03:11.172
<i>Yeah. Pretty sure
that's what I said.</i>

03:11.174 --> 03:12.340
<i>So you're a Cornhusker,</i>

03:12.342 --> 03:14.175
<i>Hai.</i>

03:14.177 --> 03:18.979
<i>Yeah... We...
I got to go.</i>

03:18.981 --> 03:20.881
<i>Yeah. Master of sushi chefs.</i>

03:20.883 --> 03:21.883
<i>So, I got to... get back.</i>

03:21.885 --> 03:22.883
<i>Right. You got to go.</i>

03:22.885 --> 03:23.884
<i>Because I'm white.</i>

03:23.886 --> 03:24.886
<i>What?</i>

03:24.888 --> 03:25.887
<i>You heard me.</i>

03:25.889 --> 03:27.422
<i>You're wh... Wait a minute.</i>

03:27.424 --> 03:28.557
<i>It's okay, brothers.</i>

03:28.559 --> 03:29.925
<i>I'm used to it.</i>

03:29.927 --> 03:31.260
<i>You're white?</i>

03:31.262 --> 03:33.162
<i>Arigato,</i> racists.

03:33.164 --> 03:33.829
Okay.

03:33.831 --> 03:35.165
Racist? No, no.

03:35.167 --> 03:38.534
Get out.

03:38.536 --> 03:39.702
This is classic.

03:39.704 --> 03:42.338
Only you two idiots could be
called racist by a white guy.

03:42.340 --> 03:43.606
We're not racists, okay?

03:43.608 --> 03:45.741
I worked at the ACLU after college.

03:45.743 --> 03:48.063
Wait, but didn't you quit that
job because of the "stinky

03:48.064 --> 03:49.044
Greek person"?

03:49.046 --> 03:51.079
Look, Stavros didn't wear deodorant.

03:51.081 --> 03:53.081
I found it to be a hostile
work environment.

03:53.083 --> 03:55.003
Well, this is an interesting
conundrum, though.

03:55.004 --> 03:56.751
Can you be racist against your own race?

03:56.753 --> 03:58.519
Like white on white...
is that racist?

03:58.521 --> 04:01.189
You know what, as a foodie, I see
where you guys are coming from.

04:01.191 --> 04:03.257
It's not being racist... it's...
discriminating.

04:03.259 --> 04:05.426
No, it's called
discrimina-tion, okay?

04:05.428 --> 04:07.628
I don't care what it's called...
if I walk into a Thai

04:07.629 --> 04:10.298
massage parlor and I see myself,
there's, like, a 60% chance I'm

04:10.300 --> 04:11.266
turning around.

04:11.268 --> 04:13.588
Exactly. It's the Peyton Hillis
conundrum; it's why white

04:13.589 --> 04:14.789
guys didn't want to draft him.

04:14.790 --> 04:17.106
So Wesley-san is the scrappy
gym rat of sushi chefs.

04:17.108 --> 04:18.574
Exactly.

04:18.576 --> 04:20.856
Sorry, just to backtrack, there
is a 40% chance that you

04:20.857 --> 04:22.617
would stay and get a
handjob from yourself.

04:22.618 --> 04:24.279
I know what I'm doing down there.

04:24.281 --> 04:26.915
Hey, hey. You got bigger problems
to worry about... racist.

04:26.917 --> 04:28.917
I think I have to go back and apologize.

04:28.919 --> 04:31.479
This sushi restaurant is across
the street from me, the food is

04:31.480 --> 04:33.955
terrific... I cannot get
banned from Spooky Sushi.

04:33.957 --> 04:36.277
All right, guys, look, we got
to talk about this weekend.

04:36.278 --> 04:38.518
Paintball... we've been talking
about it forever, okay?

04:38.519 --> 04:40.867
So I finally went ahead and
just booked it for this Sunday.

04:40.868 --> 04:41.222
Who's in?

04:41.223 --> 04:41.703
Can't do it.

04:41.704 --> 04:42.264
I can't do it.

04:42.265 --> 04:43.345
What, you got a Klan rally?

04:43.346 --> 04:45.066
No, we got kids' birthday parties.

04:45.068 --> 04:45.733
All day.

04:45.735 --> 04:46.267
All day.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.269
You know, these birthday
parties are the worst.

04:48.271 --> 04:50.705
You are stuck there talking to
people you have nothing in

04:50.707 --> 04:53.341
common with, except you had
unprotected sex at the same time.

04:53.343 --> 04:54.342
I love paintball.

04:54.344 --> 04:55.343
I'm definitely in.

04:55.345 --> 04:57.813
I've been on vacation since
I sold dallascowboys.com.

04:57.815 --> 04:59.815
Unlike these stiffs, I've
already made my nuts.

04:59.817 --> 05:01.446
All right, Andre, what's going on?

05:01.447 --> 05:03.847
You know what, I'd love to go
with you guys to Ben's party.

05:03.848 --> 05:05.448
Wait, why would you go to a kid's party?

05:05.449 --> 05:06.289
You don't have a kid.

05:06.291 --> 05:07.490
It'll be fun.

05:07.492 --> 05:08.491
No, it will not be fun.

05:08.493 --> 05:09.492
It would be creepy.

05:09.494 --> 05:10.494
Why would that be creepy?

05:10.496 --> 05:12.736
I like going, I like children,
I like going to parties.

05:12.737 --> 05:14.698
Andre, you're even creepy eating corn.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.934
Have you ever watched
yourself eat a piece of corn?

05:16.936 --> 05:20.370
It's like this...

05:20.372 --> 05:23.006
Yeah, you look like a rat
trying to gnaw off its own leg

05:23.008 --> 05:23.821
to avoid a trap.

05:23.822 --> 05:26.102
Hey, you know what, that's
because I'm trying to get all

05:26.103 --> 05:26.943
the corn off the cob.

05:26.944 --> 05:28.624
I mean, you guys...
you have sloppy cobs.

05:28.626 --> 05:31.026
I mean, I've checked 'em out at
picnics, checked 'em out at

05:31.027 --> 05:32.587
parties, checked 'em out at your house.

05:32.588 --> 05:35.188
I didn't realize you spent this
much time looking at their cobs.

05:35.189 --> 05:37.523
Of course, I check out your
cobs... 'cause I'm spending all

05:37.524 --> 05:38.284
that money on corn.

05:38.285 --> 05:39.325
Your cobs better be clean!

05:39.326 --> 05:41.566
And I'm not ashamed to admit
it... when you guys aren't

05:41.567 --> 05:43.127
looking, I'll lick
your cobs bone-dry.

05:43.128 --> 05:45.628
You ever eat two cobs at once?

05:45.630 --> 05:47.630
Sometimes I'll just
have a whole meal of cobs.

05:47.632 --> 05:48.731
Just, like, two fistfuls?

05:48.733 --> 05:50.232
Just double-fisting?

05:51.236 --> 05:53.469
No, see, I would never
grab it by the base.

05:53.471 --> 05:54.471
I would start at the tip.

05:54.472 --> 05:55.570
So, come on, guys, really?

05:55.572 --> 05:56.838
You really can't come?

05:56.840 --> 05:57.839
Can't do it.

05:57.841 --> 06:01.476
So this is the weekend of
the haves and the have-nots.

06:01.478 --> 06:03.878
I got to say...
I'm glad to be a have-not.

06:03.880 --> 06:04.879
Amen, brother.

06:04.881 --> 06:06.313
Have fun, boys.

06:06.315 --> 06:06.914
What?

06:06.916 --> 06:07.755
Screw him.

06:07.756 --> 06:08.596
Why would he do that?

06:08.597 --> 06:10.917
It's just bullshit that he
rubs it in our face like that.

06:10.918 --> 06:13.146
Like, "I don't have kids, so
now I have time to deal with

06:13.147 --> 06:15.195
fantasy football and go You know
what, here's what paintballing."

06:15.197 --> 06:16.317
we'll do... we'll
freeze him out.

06:16.318 --> 06:17.358
How are you gonna do that?

06:17.359 --> 06:18.359
Informational freeze-out.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.560
He's not gonna be around a
computer, he's not gonna be

06:20.561 --> 06:23.321
around a television... he's gonna
want fantasy football information.

06:23.322 --> 06:25.198
But he's gonna have his phone on him.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.199
You mean <i>this</i> phone?

06:26.201 --> 06:27.200
You stole his phone?

06:27.202 --> 06:30.270
What a diabolical plan, like
Schwarzenegger in <i>Batman</i>

06:30.272 --> 06:31.404
<i>and Robin.</i>

06:31.406 --> 06:33.039
<i>Hello, Pete.</i>

06:33.041 --> 06:35.909
<i>I hope you have a
nice freeze-out.</i>

06:35.911 --> 06:38.946
<i>Yeah, you're not coming to this party.</i>

06:47.001 --> 06:49.201
Anyway, Wesley-san, so, I
just wanted to apologize for

06:49.202 --> 06:50.604
Kevin, 'cause... No, no, no.

06:50.606 --> 06:51.605
...my buddy's racist.

06:51.607 --> 06:52.113
I felt it.

06:52.114 --> 06:53.274
He's a self-hating white guy.

06:53.276 --> 06:54.436
I get it, but that's not you.

06:54.438 --> 06:56.318
You like your rice white...
why not your chef?

06:56.319 --> 06:56.910
Am I right?

06:56.912 --> 06:57.912
See, I love white guys.

06:57.914 --> 06:58.913
<i>Hai.</i>

06:58.915 --> 06:59.981
<i>I mean, I've been drafting</i>

06:59.983 --> 07:01.549
<i>Peyton Hillis since he was on Denver.</i>

07:01.551 --> 07:04.452
<i>Before he started kicking
ass in Kan-sa City!</i>

07:04.454 --> 07:06.822
<i>Yeah, Kan-sa City.</i>

07:06.824 --> 07:08.824
<i>So, Ruxin-san, omakase?</i>

07:08.826 --> 07:09.825
<i>Yeah, chef's choice.</i>

07:09.827 --> 07:11.827
<i>I'm picking up on your vibe right now.</i>

07:11.829 --> 07:14.262
<i>What are you thinking, like
a spicy tuna hand roll?</i>

07:14.264 --> 07:15.264
<i>That's not you, man.</i>

07:15.266 --> 07:17.065
<i>I see the dark, the complicated.</i>

07:17.067 --> 07:19.568
<i>Ruxin-san, a lot of shit
going on in there, man.</i>

07:19.570 --> 07:21.002
<i>That's why you're like uni.</i>

07:21.004 --> 07:22.003
<i>And what's uni?</i>

07:22.005 --> 07:23.238
<i>Sea urchin, bro.</i>

07:23.240 --> 07:24.472
<i>Sea urchin?</i>

07:24.474 --> 07:25.907
<i>Yummy-umah.</i>

07:25.909 --> 07:28.743
<i>'Cause it looks like the
aftermath of a lipo surgery.</i>

07:28.745 --> 07:30.845
<i>So we don't like, fry this up?</i>

07:30.847 --> 07:32.747
<i>No, dame,</i> no.

07:32.749 --> 07:33.748
It's killer sush, dude.

07:33.750 --> 07:34.749
Okay.

07:34.751 --> 07:37.419
Am I supposed to eat this just like this?

07:39.123 --> 07:41.124
You love it?

07:41.126 --> 07:43.126
You can really taste the urchin.

07:43.128 --> 07:46.663
Okay now, Ruxin-san,
ready for <i>amaebi?</i>

07:46.665 --> 07:47.831
<i>And what is that?</i>

07:47.833 --> 07:49.266
<i>Live shrimp, dude.</i>

07:49.268 --> 07:53.837
<i>And I just... I...
You don't even feign preparation</i>

07:53.839 --> 07:54.939
<i>for this.</i>

07:54.941 --> 07:56.173
<i>Trust me, you'll love it.</i>

07:56.175 --> 07:57.708
<i>Dude, I love white dudes.</i>

07:57.710 --> 07:59.277
<i>So why would I love eating a</i>

07:59.279 --> 08:00.978
<i>live shrimp marginally prepared by one?</i>

08:00.980 --> 08:01.812
<i>Hai!</i>

08:01.814 --> 08:02.647
<i>Hai!</i>

08:02.649 --> 08:03.481
<i>Hai!</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:04.315
<i>Hi.</i>

08:04.317 --> 08:05.149
<i>Hai!</i>

08:06.719 --> 08:08.252
<i>No, I have no idea where your</i>

08:08.254 --> 08:11.389
<i>cell phone is, Pete, but I
will keep an eye out for it.</i>

08:11.391 --> 08:12.857
<i>Okay.</i>

08:12.859 --> 08:15.526
<i>Two birthday parties tomorrow.</i>

08:15.528 --> 08:18.028
<i>Patricia's kid and Ben's kid.</i>

08:18.030 --> 08:19.196
<i>What?</i>

08:19.198 --> 08:20.530
<i>Five,</i>

08:20.532 --> 08:21.665
<i>Kevin, come on.</i>

08:21.667 --> 08:23.200
<i>I just blurted out a number.</i>

08:23.202 --> 08:25.803
<i>Okay, so what's the real number then?</i>

08:25.805 --> 08:26.637
<i>Five.</i>

08:26.639 --> 08:28.806
<i>My God, woman!</i>

08:28.808 --> 08:31.109
<i>Did you even have time to eat or</i>

08:31.111 --> 08:32.309
<i>bathe yourself in between?</i>

08:32.312 --> 08:34.345
<i>Well, one was in the shower.</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:35.346
<i>Fine, who was it?</i>

08:35.347 --> 08:36.547
<i>I want to know who it was.</i>

08:36.549 --> 08:38.182
<i>It was ages ago, Kevin.</i>

08:38.183 --> 08:40.217
<i>I tell you about my sexual history.</i>

08:40.219 --> 08:41.251
<i>I don't want to know.</i>

08:41.253 --> 08:43.187
<i>I have to tell you,
otherwise I might forget.</i>

08:44.023 --> 08:45.255
<i>Just tell me who it was.</i>

08:45.257 --> 08:46.390
<i>It was in college.</i>

08:46.392 --> 08:47.591
<i>And who was it?</i>

08:47.593 --> 08:48.592
<i>It was Ben.</i>

08:48.594 --> 08:49.660
<i>Ben?</i>

08:49.662 --> 08:51.996
<i>Ben, like we're going to that</i>

08:51.998 --> 08:53.063
<i>kid's birthday party, Ben?</i>

08:53.065 --> 08:54.098
<i>That guy?</i>

08:54.100 --> 08:55.566
<i>God! I mean, what is he?</i>

08:55.568 --> 08:56.566
<i>He's got four kids.</i>

08:56.568 --> 08:58.401
<i>He's like a jackhammer,
just ba-ba-boom.</i>

08:58.403 --> 08:59.503
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

08:59.505 --> 09:00.503
<i>It's not a competition.</i>

09:00.505 --> 09:01.738
<i>It wasn't, but now it is.</i>

09:01.740 --> 09:02.672
<i>Really?</i>

09:02.674 --> 09:04.341
<i>Yeah, we're gonna break that record.</i>

09:04.343 --> 09:05.175
<i>Really?</i>

09:05.177 --> 09:06.176
<i>You and I, let's do it.</i>

09:06.178 --> 09:07.010
<i>Okay.</i>

09:07.012 --> 09:08.045
<i>Yeah, let's go, come on.</i>

09:08.047 --> 09:09.279
<i>Okay.</i>

09:09.281 --> 09:10.414
<i>We can do this. Okay.</i>

09:10.416 --> 09:11.448
<i>What are you doing?</i>

09:11.450 --> 09:12.850
<i>Need to get my strength up.</i>

09:12.852 --> 09:14.284
<i>One!</i>

09:14.286 --> 09:16.453
<i>I see stars.</i>

09:16.455 --> 09:17.421
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

09:17.423 --> 09:19.857
<i>The name of the game is
"Capture the Flag."</i>

09:19.859 --> 09:22.459
<i>If you are shot, you are eliminated.</i>

09:22.461 --> 09:23.659
<i>Put your barrel plugs in your</i>

09:23.661 --> 09:26.395
<i>weapons, raise your hand,
walk off the field.</i>

09:26.397 --> 09:27.396
<i>Guess what I have?</i>

09:27.398 --> 09:28.530
<i>Holy shit, that's my phone.</i>

09:28.532 --> 09:29.564
<i>Where'd you find it?</i>

09:29.566 --> 09:30.686
<i>Kevin found it at our house.</i>

09:30.687 --> 09:32.467
<i>Whatever, just give me the phone.</i>

09:32.469 --> 09:33.635
<i>What language is this?</i>

09:33.637 --> 09:34.936
<i>Is this Portuguese?</i>

09:34.938 --> 09:36.237
<i>Yep.</i>

09:37.206 --> 09:38.806
<i>Well.</i>

09:38.808 --> 09:40.140
<i>Hello?</i>

09:41.410 --> 09:42.609
<i>Kevin, change it back.</i>

09:42.611 --> 09:44.711
<i>Well, I would, but I don't
speak Portuguese, so...</i>

09:44.713 --> 09:45.746
<i>Come on, it's Sunday.</i>

09:45.748 --> 09:47.147
<i>I need to check my scores.</i>

09:47.149 --> 09:48.275
<i>With all my terrible, boring</i>

09:48.276 --> 09:49.516
<i>responsibilities today, I don't</i>

09:49.518 --> 09:51.117
<i>know if I'd have time to do</i>

09:51.119 --> 09:52.619
<i>something fun like switch your</i>

09:52.621 --> 09:53.820
<i>phone back from Portuguese.</i>

09:53.822 --> 09:55.455
<i>Ata a vista.</i>

09:55.457 --> 09:57.990
<i>No... Dick.</i>

09:57.992 --> 10:00.425
<i>Masks must be worn at all times.</i>

10:00.427 --> 10:03.661
<i>No head, neck, or groin
shots within ten feet.</i>

10:03.663 --> 10:06.964
<i>Give me some space here, commando?</i>

10:06.966 --> 10:07.999
<i>What's up?</i>

10:08.001 --> 10:09.000
<i>Shit.</i>

10:09.002 --> 10:10.067
<i>What?</i>

10:10.069 --> 10:12.303
<i>Raffi, what the hell are you doing here?</i>

10:12.305 --> 10:13.137
<i>Paintball.</i>

10:13.139 --> 10:14.379
<i>Taco put it on his myface page.</i>

10:14.381 --> 10:15.341
<i>I figured I was invited.</i>

10:15.342 --> 10:17.006
<i>Please don't tell me he's on our team?</i>

10:17.008 --> 10:18.007
<i>Yeah, I'm on your team.</i>

10:18.009 --> 10:19.169
<i>I don't like it either, guys.</i>

10:19.170 --> 10:20.977
<i>I'm more of an army of one kind of a guy.</i>

10:20.979 --> 10:22.178
<i>What smells like feces?</i>

10:22.180 --> 10:22.925
<i>Yeah, that's me.</i>

10:22.926 --> 10:24.126
<i>Yeah, no, I've been living out</i>

10:24.127 --> 10:25.247
<i>here for like, three or four</i>

10:25.248 --> 10:27.001
<i>days, you know, getting
the lay of the land.</i>

10:27.003 --> 10:28.169
<i>Most of my meals are coming from</i>

10:28.171 --> 10:28.917
<i>second harvest, though.</i>

10:28.918 --> 10:29.798
<i>What's second harvest?</i>

10:29.799 --> 10:31.701
<i>You know, animals don't
digest everything they eat.</i>

10:31.702 --> 10:32.822
<i>You can find a lot perfectly</i>

10:32.823 --> 10:34.063
<i>edible food in their droppings.</i>

10:34.064 --> 10:35.224
<i>Holy s... is that a real gun?</i>

10:35.225 --> 10:36.691
<i>What?
No, this is a paintball gun.</i>

10:36.693 --> 10:37.493
<i>What are you, crazy?</i>

10:37.494 --> 10:39.461
<i>The other two are real, though.</i>

10:39.463 --> 10:42.164
<i>Only when you hear me blow
this whistle will the game</i>

10:42.166 --> 10:43.098
<i>begin.</i>

10:43.100 --> 10:44.099
<i>Guess what?</i>

10:44.101 --> 10:45.467
<i>Game just began.</i>

10:45.469 --> 10:46.968
<i>Murder!</i>

10:49.372 --> 10:50.471
<i>We're gonna win.</i>

10:50.473 --> 10:52.540
<i>My business is killing me, man.</i>

10:52.542 --> 10:54.809
<i>I'm in the middle of trying
to break this sex record.</i>

10:54.811 --> 10:56.644
<i>How many times have you had sex?</i>

10:56.646 --> 10:58.646
<i>Four times in the last 18 hours.</i>

10:58.648 --> 10:59.947
<i>That doesn't sound fun to me.</i>

10:59.949 --> 11:00.948
<i>It's grueling.</i>

11:00.950 --> 11:03.351
<i>I think the third time, between
us, nothing came out.</i>

11:03.353 --> 11:04.686
<i>Like my dick just dry heaved.</i>

11:04.688 --> 11:07.188
<i>I feel like I'm running some
sort of sexual marathon.</i>

11:07.190 --> 11:09.190
<i>Buddy, you're up cock-break
hill right now.</i>

11:09.192 --> 11:11.292
<i>Did someone say a marathon?
A what?</i>

11:11.294 --> 11:12.359
<i>A marathon? A what?</i>

11:12.361 --> 11:13.494
<i>A marathon? A what?</i>

11:13.496 --> 11:14.328
<i>Guys, come on.</i>

11:14.330 --> 11:15.450
<i>You can't do it to yourself.</i>

11:15.452 --> 11:16.412
<i>I could do it to myself.</i>

11:16.413 --> 11:17.064
<i>I just did it.</i>

11:17.066 --> 11:18.799
<i>What are you doing here, Andre?</i>

11:18.801 --> 11:19.841
<i>You don't even have a kid.</i>

11:19.842 --> 11:21.368
<i>You guys have been holding out on me.</i>

11:21.370 --> 11:23.370
<i>I'm meeting people I haven't
seen in a long time.</i>

11:23.371 --> 11:24.738
<i>I'm having some delicious food,</i>

11:24.740 --> 11:25.873
<i>and I'm getting to entertain</i>

11:25.875 --> 11:27.141
<i>these kids because guess what?</i>

11:27.143 --> 11:28.809
<i>The magic man is on the loose.</i>

11:28.811 --> 11:30.911
<i>No, magic is creepy for adults.</i>

11:30.913 --> 11:32.846
<i>You will give these children nightmares.</i>

11:32.848 --> 11:33.768
<i>Is Lance Burton creepy?</i>

11:33.769 --> 11:34.515
<i>Yep.</i>

11:34.517 --> 11:35.349
<i>Kevin.</i>

11:35.351 --> 11:36.250
<i>What?</i>

11:36.252 --> 11:38.132
<i>The Amazing Andre is
experiencing something...</i>

11:38.133 --> 11:38.919
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

11:38.921 --> 11:39.920
<i>...within you.</i>

11:39.922 --> 11:41.162
<i>You may not know this about me,</i>

11:41.163 --> 11:43.858
<i>but I have the power... God.</i>

11:43.860 --> 11:45.359
<i>...of the dark arts.</i>

11:45.361 --> 11:47.161
<i>If you... God.</i>

11:47.163 --> 11:50.130
<i>They say that you can manifest
anything that you think</i>

11:50.132 --> 11:51.832
<i>of, and it's all right there.</i>

11:51.834 --> 11:53.333
<i>My sweet God.</i>

11:53.335 --> 11:57.704
<i>So now, my question to you
is what do you believe in?</i>

11:57.706 --> 12:00.741
<i>What do you want to... ta-da!</i>

12:00.743 --> 12:02.109
<i>Jesus, Andre, if you do that</i>

12:02.111 --> 12:04.645
<i>to a child, they're gonna
shut this place down faster</i>

12:04.647 --> 12:05.746
<i>than Penn State.</i>

12:05.748 --> 12:06.780
<i>Come on, it's fun.</i>

12:06.782 --> 12:08.048
<i>No, it's not fun, it's weird.</i>

12:08.050 --> 12:09.049
<i>Yes.</i>

12:09.051 --> 12:10.350
<i>Party people.</i>

12:10.352 --> 12:11.618
<i>What, what?</i>

12:11.620 --> 12:13.520
<i>Thank you guys so much for coming.</i>

12:13.522 --> 12:14.362
<i>Thanks for having us.</i>

12:14.363 --> 12:15.756
<i>You got a bathroom I could use?</i>

12:15.758 --> 12:17.758
<i>Yeah, the guest room is
right down the hall.</i>

12:17.760 --> 12:18.640
<i>What about the master?</i>

12:18.641 --> 12:19.460
<i>No chance.</i>

12:19.462 --> 12:20.294
<i>Worth a shot.</i>

12:20.296 --> 12:21.576
<i>I'm gonna go blow that thing up.</i>

12:21.577 --> 12:24.497
<i>All right, well, the
magician must prepare, so...</i>

12:24.499 --> 12:27.734
<i>What's that?</i>

12:28.770 --> 12:29.635
<i>He get you?</i>

12:29.637 --> 12:31.403
<i>Well, not really, but I went with it.</i>

12:31.405 --> 12:33.072
<i>It's so great to see you again.</i>

12:33.074 --> 12:34.807
<i>You, too.
You really just had a kid?</i>

12:34.809 --> 12:35.641
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:35.643 --> 12:36.575
<i>You look fantastic.</i>

12:36.577 --> 12:37.576
<i>Stop it.</i>

12:37.578 --> 12:38.610
<i>And you have four, right?</i>

12:38.612 --> 12:39.611
<i>Well, we want six.</i>

12:39.613 --> 12:40.612
<i>Really?</i>

12:40.614 --> 12:41.914
<i>Yeah. We'd like to, you know?</i>

12:41.916 --> 12:43.048
<i>Get a hobby.</i>

12:43.050 --> 12:44.082
<i>That is our hobby.</i>

12:44.084 --> 12:46.218
<i>Yeah, he's good at it, so...
Thank you.</i>

12:46.220 --> 12:47.140
<i>Thank you guys so much.</i>

12:47.142 --> 12:47.982
<i>Yeah, this was great.</i>

12:47.983 --> 12:48.786
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:48.788 --> 12:49.708
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

12:49.709 --> 12:50.455
<i>Kevin.</i>

12:50.457 --> 12:51.497
<i>What a D. That's it, babe.</i>

12:51.498 --> 12:52.323
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

12:52.325 --> 12:54.560
<i>We're breaking that record
today, right here.</i>

12:54.562 --> 12:55.594
<i>Right here on the grass?</i>

12:55.596 --> 12:56.929
<i>In that tree.</i>

12:59.334 --> 13:00.633
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

13:00.635 --> 13:02.002
<i>Go, go.</i>

13:05.906 --> 13:08.241
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

13:13.681 --> 13:14.915
<i>Get down, down! Down, down!</i>

13:17.252 --> 13:18.252
<i>This is awesome.</i>

13:18.254 --> 13:19.253
<i>This is amazing.</i>

13:19.255 --> 13:21.255
<i>These guys are totally missing out.</i>

13:21.257 --> 13:22.423
<i>Check out what I brought.</i>

13:22.425 --> 13:23.925
<i>Paint knife for close quarters.</i>

13:23.927 --> 13:24.926
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

13:24.928 --> 13:25.961
<i>I got a paint knife guy.</i>

13:25.963 --> 13:27.123
<i>You literally brought a paint</i>

13:27.124 --> 13:28.204
<i>knife to a paint gun fight.</i>

13:28.205 --> 13:30.466
<i>All right, I got to get a fantasy update.</i>

13:30.468 --> 13:31.467
<i>Eat paint, dick hole!</i>

13:31.469 --> 13:33.335
<i>Guys, what's going on with the games?</i>

13:33.337 --> 13:34.217
<i>I need a score update.</i>

13:34.218 --> 13:35.938
<i>I don't know, your team</i>

13:35.940 --> 13:37.206
<i>could be doing muito ruim.</i>

13:37.208 --> 13:38.207
<i>Or muito bom.</i>

13:38.209 --> 13:40.209
<i>Enough. Just tell me,
am I winning or not?</i>

13:40.211 --> 13:42.445
<i>Eat it, dick.</i>

13:42.447 --> 13:44.981
<i>Assholes! They're freezing
me out, aren't they?</i>

13:44.983 --> 13:45.815
<i>It's a freeze-out.</i>

13:45.817 --> 13:46.816
<i>Looks like it.</i>

13:46.818 --> 13:47.651
<i>Shit. Here.</i>

13:47.653 --> 13:48.651
<i>Do something with this.</i>

13:48.653 --> 13:49.786
<i>I got you!</i>

13:49.788 --> 13:51.120
<i>Hey! I got you!</i>

13:51.122 --> 13:52.722
<i>Lie down and die!</i>

13:52.724 --> 13:54.523
<i>There you go. I fixed it.</i>

13:54.525 --> 13:55.524
<i>Taco, this is Japanese.</i>

13:55.526 --> 13:57.360
<i>Yeah, I know a bit of Japanese.</i>

13:57.362 --> 13:58.482
<i>Well, am I winning? Read it.</i>

13:58.484 --> 13:59.524
<i>No, I can't read Japanese.</i>

13:59.525 --> 14:01.564
<i>You have to read it to me,
and I understand it.</i>

14:01.566 --> 14:02.699
<i>All right, enough playing</i>

14:02.700 --> 14:03.900
<i>around... we need to focus up.</i>

14:03.902 --> 14:04.901
<i>This is a war zone.</i>

14:04.903 --> 14:06.302
<i>I've got a P.O.W. camp two</i>

14:06.304 --> 14:08.305
<i>clicks north of here in
case we capture somebody.</i>

14:08.307 --> 14:10.467
<i>Raffi, where the hell do you
think you are right now?</i>

14:10.468 --> 14:12.076
<i>Vietnam, man. Vietnam!</i>

14:12.078 --> 14:13.077
<i>You were in Vietnam?</i>

14:13.079 --> 14:15.913
<i>Yeah, 2007, actually, on a
pretty intense sexual</i>

14:15.915 --> 14:16.981
<i>holiday.</i>

14:16.983 --> 14:18.149
<i>It was pretty cool.</i>

14:18.151 --> 14:20.751
<i>I had this one girl, she
was back like this.</i>

14:21.988 --> 14:22.987
<i>Something stung me.</i>

14:22.989 --> 14:23.988
<i>What is it?</i>

14:23.990 --> 14:24.922
<i>Yeah, you got shot.</i>

14:24.924 --> 14:25.964
<i>What? No, I put that paint</i>

14:25.965 --> 14:27.085
<i>there before the whole thing</i>

14:27.086 --> 14:28.326
<i>started, so it's not that big a</i>

14:28.327 --> 14:29.407
<i>deal; don't worry about it.</i>

14:29.408 --> 14:30.228
<i>What is that?</i>

14:30.230 --> 14:31.229
<i>You're out of the game.</i>

14:31.231 --> 14:32.263
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

14:32.265 --> 14:33.397
<i>This is not a game.</i>

14:33.399 --> 14:34.932
<i>This is war, okay, tall guy?</i>

14:34.934 --> 14:38.903
<i>And as far as I'm concerned,
you're now the enemy.</i>

14:38.905 --> 14:40.338
<i>I'll see you guys in hell.</i>

14:40.340 --> 14:41.873
<i>Gattaca!</i>

14:41.875 --> 14:42.874
<i>Did he say "Gattaca"?</i>

14:44.010 --> 14:45.243
<i>Come and get me!</i>

14:45.245 --> 14:46.378
<i>Come and get me!</i>

14:50.718 --> 14:51.750
<i>Eat my dick!</i>

14:51.752 --> 14:52.751
<i>Gattaca!</i>

14:52.753 --> 14:55.148
<i>Shit, Raffi went rogue.</i>

14:55.350 --> 14:56.618
<i>Come and get me!</i>

14:57.056 --> 14:58.150
<i>God.</i>

15:06.595 --> 15:07.895
Hey, Wesley-san.

15:07.897 --> 15:08.963
Hey.

15:08.965 --> 15:09.964
Ruxin.

15:09.966 --> 15:11.766
Ruxin-san, yeah.

15:11.768 --> 15:13.234
This is my wife Yumiko.

15:13.236 --> 15:14.268
Yumiko, Ruxin.

15:14.270 --> 15:15.303
<i>Konichiwa.</i>

15:15.305 --> 15:16.404
<i>Sorry, bro, no English.</i>

15:16.406 --> 15:17.572
<i>Shocker.</i>

15:22.078 --> 15:23.210
<i>Konichiwa.</i>

15:23.212 --> 15:25.379
<i>Konichiwa.</i> Totally, totally.

15:25.381 --> 15:26.580
All right, babe, okay.

15:27.817 --> 15:29.817
So you married yourself a Japanese girl,

15:29.819 --> 15:30.818
Yeah.

15:30.820 --> 15:31.819
How about that.

15:31.821 --> 15:32.653
Interesting, yeah.

15:32.655 --> 15:33.754
How so?

15:33.756 --> 15:36.490
Well, it's just funny 'cause you
called me a white racist for

15:36.492 --> 15:39.493
choosing an Asian chef, and then
you had your run of all the

15:39.495 --> 15:42.397
white women in the world and you
chose yourself an Asian girl.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.599
I mean, it's just interesting.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.666
You lost me, bro.

15:44.668 --> 15:46.000
Dude, you're a white racist.

15:46.002 --> 15:47.335
I'm not racist, bro.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.502
Really?

15:48.504 --> 15:50.105
Japanese beer? Hokkaido?

15:50.107 --> 15:51.105
I just prefer it.

15:51.107 --> 15:52.240
You don't see this?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.441
You don't see my point?

15:53.443 --> 15:54.742
Super frustrating, bro.

15:54.744 --> 15:57.645
Super frustrating, bro.

16:03.920 --> 16:04.619
Shit!

16:04.621 --> 16:05.320
Jesus Christ!

16:05.322 --> 16:06.522
We're getting pinned down bad.

16:06.523 --> 16:07.122
<i>Gattaca!</i>

16:07.124 --> 16:10.158
<i>Shit, Raffi's trying to kill us, too.</i>

16:10.160 --> 16:10.692
<i>Gattaca!</i>

16:10.694 --> 16:12.360
<i>I didn't think he'd seen that movie.</i>

16:12.362 --> 16:13.929
<i>He wouldn't be yelling that if he had.</i>

16:13.931 --> 16:16.965
<i>Shit, man!
I gotta get my scores.</i>

16:18.001 --> 16:22.171
<i>Okay, hey, Pete, guess what?</i>

16:22.173 --> 16:23.605
<i>I'm in the middle of something.</i>

16:23.607 --> 16:25.540
<i>You're not getting these scores, Pete.</i>

16:25.542 --> 16:26.708
<i>Stop saying "Pete," okay?</i>

16:26.710 --> 16:27.776
<i>Okay, no more Pete.</i>

16:27.778 --> 16:29.711
<i>All right, let's get a picture of this.</i>

16:29.713 --> 16:30.212
<i>Wait.</i>

16:30.214 --> 16:31.546
<i>Me crossing the finish line!</i>

16:31.548 --> 16:33.615
<i>Kevin... Switching to video.</i>

16:33.617 --> 16:35.151
<i>No, Kevin! Stop!</i>

16:35.153 --> 16:36.218
<i>Switching back!</i>

16:36.220 --> 16:37.453
<i>And here we...</i>

16:37.455 --> 16:38.120
<i>What?</i>

16:38.122 --> 16:39.388
<i>God, I got a cramp!</i>

16:39.390 --> 16:39.822
<i>What?</i>

16:39.824 --> 16:40.990
<i>I got a cramp!</i>

16:40.992 --> 16:41.724
<i>I'm going down!</i>

16:41.726 --> 16:42.525
<i>Are you okay?</i>

16:42.527 --> 16:43.659
<i>I finished.</i>

16:43.661 --> 16:46.128
<i>Yay.</i>

16:46.130 --> 16:47.029
<i>Fives.</i>

16:47.031 --> 16:48.530
<i>All right, we're running out of time.</i>

16:48.532 --> 16:50.699
<i>We're gonna have to blast
our way out of here.</i>

16:50.701 --> 16:52.200
<i>Yeah, we need to win this thing.</i>

16:52.202 --> 16:54.136
<i>No, I don't give a shit
about the paintball.</i>

16:54.138 --> 16:55.237
<i>I gotta get my scores.</i>

16:55.239 --> 16:55.971
<i>You ready?</i>

16:55.973 --> 16:56.505
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:56.507 --> 16:59.008
<i>Three... two... one.</i>

16:59.010 --> 17:00.243
<i>I slept with Megan.</i>

17:00.245 --> 17:01.177
<i>What?</i>

17:01.179 --> 17:02.145
<i>Go!</i>

17:02.147 --> 17:02.679
<i>Whoo!</i>

17:02.681 --> 17:03.546
<i>What?!</i>

17:06.151 --> 17:07.517
<i>Let's go!</i>

17:07.519 --> 17:10.087
<i>Yah!</i>

17:23.101 --> 17:25.502
<i>Break left!</i>

17:27.272 --> 17:29.574
<i>Paint knife!</i>

17:34.281 --> 17:35.747
<i>Let's get out of here!</i>

17:35.749 --> 17:36.215
<i>Pete!</i>

17:36.217 --> 17:37.049
<i>What?</i>

17:37.051 --> 17:39.218
<i>The flag! We can win this.</i>

17:41.355 --> 17:43.022
<i>Now Kevin decides to call.</i>

17:43.024 --> 17:46.125
<i>How did you turn my ringtone Japanese?</i>

17:46.127 --> 17:48.461
<i>Sorry, tall guy.</i>

17:51.033 --> 17:53.867
<i>Welcome to Gattaca, asshole!</i>

17:53.869 --> 17:55.469
<i>That was a terrible movie.</i>

17:55.471 --> 17:57.037
<i>Wait. It's a movie?</i>

17:57.039 --> 17:59.239
<i>I can feel your penis in
the back of my head.</i>

17:59.241 --> 18:00.406
<i>It's a war boner, man.</i>

18:03.779 --> 18:05.412
<i>Did you just pee on me?</i>

18:05.414 --> 18:09.049
<i>Man, we just shared something, Taco.</i>

18:10.319 --> 18:12.285
<i>Wouldn't it be magic, kids,</i>

18:12.287 --> 18:13.987
<i>if the Amazing Andre knew every</i>

18:13.989 --> 18:15.922
<i>card before he called them?</i>

18:15.924 --> 18:16.923
<i>Is it a nine?</i>

18:16.925 --> 18:17.924
<i>Is it a eight?</i>

18:17.926 --> 18:18.458
<i>Is it a...?</i>

18:19.160 --> 18:20.259
<i>Hi. Someone's in here.</i>

18:20.261 --> 18:21.327
<i>I ripped my groin, Andre.</i>

18:21.329 --> 18:22.061
<i>Move!</i>

18:22.063 --> 18:22.495
<i>What?</i>

18:22.497 --> 18:23.329
<i>What do I do?</i>

18:23.331 --> 18:24.230
<i>My groin's killing me!</i>

18:24.232 --> 18:25.097
<i>Sports rub, maybe.</i>

18:25.099 --> 18:25.798
<i>I don't know.</i>

18:25.800 --> 18:26.332
<i>Sports rub.</i>

18:26.334 --> 18:27.633
<i>All right, get out. Get out!</i>

18:27.635 --> 18:28.500
<i>All right!</i>

18:28.502 --> 18:30.269
<i>God! Thank God!</i>

18:30.271 --> 18:33.272
<i>Please, can I just get up
into that master bath?</i>

18:33.274 --> 18:35.474
<i>Buddy, I told you, master
bath's off-limits, okay?</i>

18:35.476 --> 18:37.843
<i>I just need a 20-minute
master bath sesh.</i>

18:37.845 --> 18:39.278
<i>I need access to a shower,</i>

18:39.279 --> 18:40.479
<i>I need some quality magazines.</i>

18:40.934 --> 18:42.014
<i>Man, you know your problem?</i>

18:42.016 --> 18:43.136
<i>You're eating all this candy</i>

18:43.137 --> 18:44.337
<i>like you're a little shit pig.</i>

18:44.338 --> 18:45.258
<i>It's not the food, man.</i>

18:45.259 --> 18:47.921
<i>It's that goddamn white sushi chef.</i>

18:47.923 --> 18:49.088
<i>He gave me food poisoning.</i>

18:49.090 --> 18:50.089
<i>No, man.</i>

18:50.091 --> 18:51.091
<i>You been to Spooky Sushi?</i>

18:51.092 --> 18:52.458
<i>Yeah, and it's haunting me.</i>

18:52.460 --> 18:56.196
<i>Hey, Ku Klux Kabachi,
what's up, Wesley-san?</i>

18:56.198 --> 18:59.299
<i>Hey, Ruxin. Bree, bro, brat-san.</i>

18:59.301 --> 19:00.181
<i>What's up, Wesley-san?</i>

19:00.182 --> 19:00.934
<i>What's up, buddy?</i>

19:00.936 --> 19:01.968
<i>You don't look so good.</i>

19:01.970 --> 19:03.143
<i>Yeah, it's 'cause you gave</i>

19:03.144 --> 19:04.304
<i>me food poisoning last night.</i>

19:04.306 --> 19:06.272
<i>Japanese chef would never poison you.</i>

19:06.274 --> 19:08.341
<i>Yeah, I don't think
you're a Japanese chef.</i>

19:08.343 --> 19:11.010
<i>I consider you a white dude
from Oma-ha who can't make</i>

19:11.012 --> 19:12.278
<i>sush for shit!</i>

19:12.280 --> 19:14.547
<i>Bro...
In fact, I would rather have</i>

19:14.549 --> 19:17.417
<i>your son here make me sashimi
than have you make me a</i>

19:17.419 --> 19:18.151
<i>veggie roll.</i>

19:18.153 --> 19:19.719
<i>Bro, you got to back off now.</i>

19:19.721 --> 19:22.722
<i>Or what? You gonna whip out
some cornhusker ka-ra-te?</i>

19:22.724 --> 19:24.124
<i>I don't want to, but I will.</i>

19:24.126 --> 19:25.458
<i>Well, if you're as good at</i>

19:25.460 --> 19:26.759
<i>karate as you are making sushi,</i>

19:26.761 --> 19:28.227
<i>I think I'm gonna be just fine.</i>

19:28.229 --> 19:29.896
<i>Bro, you really think I poisoned you?</i>

19:29.898 --> 19:30.797
<i>Hai!</i>

19:30.799 --> 19:31.330
<i>Hai!</i>

19:32.300 --> 19:33.166
<i>Hai!</i>

19:33.168 --> 19:34.467
<i>My God, Ruxin!</i>

19:34.469 --> 19:36.202
<i>The sush is loosh!</i>

19:36.204 --> 19:38.337
<i>Fine, buddy, you can use the master.</i>

19:38.339 --> 19:39.505
<i>This guy fed me SpongeBob</i>

19:39.506 --> 19:40.706
<i>SquarePants, and now I'm gonna</i>

19:40.708 --> 19:42.175
<i>die, like in Alien!</i>

19:42.177 --> 19:44.177
<i>I'm gonna poke you in a few places, okay?</i>

19:44.179 --> 19:44.976
<i>Does this hurt?</i>

19:44.978 --> 19:45.742
<i>God, yes!</i>

19:45.744 --> 19:46.577
<i>It's appendicitis.</i>

19:46.579 --> 19:47.310
<i>Call an ambulance!</i>

19:47.312 --> 19:48.011
<i>It's what?</i>

19:48.013 --> 19:49.913
<i>Appendicitis.</i>

19:49.915 --> 19:51.214
<i>My bad, bro.</i>

19:51.216 --> 19:53.550
<i>Am I still paying for the Spooky Sushi?</i>

19:53.552 --> 19:54.217
<i>Hai!</i>

19:54.219 --> 19:55.552
<i>Hai,</i> bro.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.179
Who had such a stinky diaper?

20:06.181 --> 20:08.081
Did you have such a stinky diaper?

20:08.083 --> 20:09.115
I'm in trouble.

20:09.117 --> 20:10.116
Baby, baby!

20:10.118 --> 20:13.144
I was applying some sports rub,
and I was lathering up, and

20:13.146 --> 20:14.776
some of it got in my tailpipe!

20:14.778 --> 20:15.677
It's burning so bad!

20:15.679 --> 20:16.614
Okay, okay, lay down.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.059
Lay down. Lay... down.

20:18.061 --> 20:19.033
God!

20:19.035 --> 20:20.010
Just take these off.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.322
Help, help, help, help!

20:21.324 --> 20:22.584
God!

20:22.586 --> 20:24.051
My God!

20:24.053 --> 20:25.347
It hurts so bad!

20:25.349 --> 20:27.596
Yeah, I'm gonna take a wipe, okay?

20:27.598 --> 20:29.408
Got a piece of that record!

20:29.410 --> 20:30.352
You did so good.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.424
I'm a grown-ass man
and I did it... God!

20:32.426 --> 20:34.180
You are a grown-ass
man, and you did it.

20:34.182 --> 20:35.942
Okay, does that feel
better on you bum-bum?

20:36.606 --> 20:37.265
Yeah, yeah.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.655
My poor boys.

20:39.657 --> 20:41.411
No.

20:43.413 --> 20:46.163
Hey, Ruxin had appendicitis.

20:46.165 --> 20:48.714
I didn't know you guys were doing this.

20:48.716 --> 20:50.903
Wait, Ben... I tied your
sex record, buddy.

20:50.905 --> 20:52.065
What? Come on, guys!

20:52.067 --> 20:54.450
Really? Six times in
my daughter's bedroom?

20:54.452 --> 20:55.250
Thank you.

20:55.252 --> 20:56.406
And it's her birthday.

20:56.408 --> 20:57.701
By the way, that doesn't count.

20:57.703 --> 20:59.491
But I am gonna try it.

20:59.493 --> 21:01.312
Did he say six times?

21:01.314 --> 21:02.841
Whoops.
