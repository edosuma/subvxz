00:09.719 --> 00:13.348
<i>NARRATOR". Another bright, brisk morning
in Gotham City.</i>

00:13.556 --> 00:18.686
<i>For such a bustling metropolis,
the day seems to have begun quite normally.</i>

00:18.895 --> 00:23.358
<i>But wait, do we sense
something slightly off-key?</i>

00:23.566 --> 00:28.029
<i>Here in the Keyborn Bookstore perhaps?</i>

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.466 --> 00:52.053
<i>Or in the Keynote Music Shop?</i>

01:01.479 --> 01:03.523
<i>Or even in the sacred precincts...</i>

01:03.690 --> 01:06.985
...of <i>the ultra conservative
Gotham City Key Club?</i>

01:16.494 --> 01:18.371
<i>Meanwhile, at Wayne Manor...</i>

01:18.580 --> 01:22.875
<i>...stately home of millionaire Bruce Wayne
and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson...</i>

01:23.209 --> 01:27.213
All right, take it from the top, Dick.
Ahem. Besides its famous apes...

01:27.422 --> 01:32.885
...and the part it's always played in history,
the Rock of Gibraltar is also famous for...?

01:33.094 --> 01:35.013
-It's the key to the Mediterranean.
-Aha.

01:35.221 --> 01:36.514
Right, Dick.

01:36.723 --> 01:40.852
You might make that the keynote
of your geography paper.

01:41.060 --> 01:44.314
- A headache, Bruce?
-No, no, just a bit weary.

01:44.522 --> 01:47.817
But thanks to the brief respite
from crime-fighting...

01:48.026 --> 01:52.947
...which we seem to be enjoying,
my energies will be quickly restored.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.407
What?

01:54.616 --> 01:56.326
Upside down?

01:56.534 --> 01:58.244
Pointing the wrong way?

01:58.411 --> 02:01.247
Hmm. We'll get right on it.

02:01.623 --> 02:03.833
That was the manager
of the Keystone Building.

02:04.042 --> 02:07.962
Someone has been playing havoc
with the big sign identifying it.

02:08.170 --> 02:11.883
Probably the work of some prankster, heh,
or some joker.

02:12.091 --> 02:15.136
Jo-- Of course, Chief O'Hara.

02:15.345 --> 02:19.015
Who else but that malevolent mischief-maker
could be taunting us again...

02:19.223 --> 02:20.933
...with his capricious capers?

02:21.142 --> 02:25.396
You still don't think
we should call the Caped Crusader?

02:25.730 --> 02:29.150
When books, records and files
are involved, Chief O'Hara...

02:29.317 --> 02:32.278
...I think that we should try
to tackle the problem ourselves...

02:32.445 --> 02:36.449
...but when it comes to tampering
with the buildings of our fine city...

02:36.658 --> 02:38.868
...we have no other choice.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.461
I think I found it, Bruce.

02:48.670 --> 02:51.506
I'm afraid you spoke too soon, sir.
Let me answer it for you.

02:51.714 --> 02:53.800
I can always think up a bit of a taradiddle.

02:54.008 --> 02:58.638
No, Alfred, if the commissioner needs us,
this is no time for a white lie, even the smallest.

02:58.846 --> 03:02.100
- Yes, commissioner?
-I'm afraid it's the Joker again, Batman.

03:02.517 --> 03:03.643
We'll be right there.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.812
To the Batpoles.

04:44.202 --> 04:47.497
We're having the locks replaced
in this building.

04:47.705 --> 04:52.668
And when the new keys arrived today,
this was in with them.

04:53.628 --> 04:56.005
- Holy vertebra.
- Indeed.

04:56.798 --> 04:59.509
A macabre little opener.

04:59.717 --> 05:00.760
Read the attached note.

05:02.637 --> 05:06.224
"Latched or mastered,
skeletoned or passed...

05:06.432 --> 05:10.686
...spot the Scot before you're outclassed."

05:10.895 --> 05:12.814
Latched or mastered?

05:13.022 --> 05:16.901
I suspect he used the past tense
to further confuse us, Robin.

05:17.109 --> 05:21.155
Latch, master, pass, skeleton.

05:21.364 --> 05:24.909
They're all terms which refer to keys.

05:25.117 --> 05:28.538
Like the Key Club or the Keystone Building.

05:28.746 --> 05:32.959
Some seventh sense tells me
that this particular Scot...

05:33.167 --> 05:36.254
...is billionaire Angus Ferguson...

05:36.462 --> 05:40.132
...the famous Scottish collector
who's currently visiting our fair city.

05:40.341 --> 05:43.719
Just what I was thinking, Batman,
now that you, uh, reminded me.

05:45.096 --> 05:48.015
Obviously there is a connection here.

05:48.224 --> 05:52.144
Mr. Ferguson is having a private showing
today of his fabulous collection of keys.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.897
How can anyone
have a fabulous collection of keys?

05:55.106 --> 05:57.358
There are some famous keys
in the world, Robin.

05:57.567 --> 06:02.738
Of which Angus Ferguson
has either the original or an exact replica...

06:02.947 --> 06:06.242
...including the piéce de résistance
of his current show...

06:06.450 --> 06:08.661
...the famous Jeweled Key of Kaincardine...

06:08.870 --> 06:13.499
...handed down through the ages
from one Scottish ruler to another.

06:13.666 --> 06:16.711
Hmm. Holy key ring. Where is this showing?

06:16.919 --> 06:18.754
At his private suite at Gotham Towers.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.632
We have as many of our men
posted there as we can spare...

06:21.799 --> 06:24.510
...but, ha, ha, if this note is from the Joker...

06:25.052 --> 06:27.096
I suggest we take a look...

06:27.305 --> 06:32.935
...at Ferguson's fabulous collection of keys.

06:50.620 --> 06:53.873
Ah. This should do it.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.091
Ah. Ah!

07:04.258 --> 07:07.720
At last, success
beyond even my wildest dreams.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.308
Success, Joker, because you can turn
an itsy-bitsy key in an itsy-bitsy box?

07:12.475 --> 07:16.103
Glad you could tear yourself away
from that mirror for one minute, Cornelia...

07:16.270 --> 07:18.064
...to admire my latest triumph.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.567
This box, and particularly
this key I've just made...

07:21.776 --> 07:25.488
...could be the downfall of those audacious
adversaries, Batman and Robin...

07:25.696 --> 07:29.825
...and give me free reign
to pursue my cunning career. Ha, ha!

07:30.034 --> 07:33.204
- How did you make the box, Joker?
-Oh, out of bits and pieces, lads.

07:33.412 --> 07:37.166
Odds and ends, cheese paddings,
lightning bugs, cockroach shells...

07:37.375 --> 07:40.962
...all combined with my talents
in other fields, of course. Ha, ha.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.713
But enough of this chitchat.

07:42.922 --> 07:45.299
I am off to make my first experiment.

07:45.508 --> 07:50.388
And when I return, I suspect I will not only
have confounded the Dynamic Duo...

07:50.596 --> 07:55.476
...but I will have in my possession
the Jeweled Key of Kaincardine.

07:55.685 --> 07:57.061
- The what?
-Ho-ho-ho.

07:57.269 --> 08:01.607
The diamonds with which it is encrusted
are worth a king's ransom, Cornelia.

08:01.816 --> 08:05.569
Not to mention the rubies in its loop,
the emeralds in its stern...

08:05.778 --> 08:10.116
...the sapphires in its collar,
and the fire opals in its bit.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.248
Ah. It's so good.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.125
Aye.

08:19.959 --> 08:22.128
The Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.630
Well, it's good to have you here.

08:24.839 --> 08:26.507
Help yourself to a doch-an-dorris.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.051
It's a breath of heather
from me brewster, my golly.

08:29.218 --> 08:32.471
Thank you, Mr. Ferguson,
but we'd just like to browse a bit.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.600
Browse, aye, browse.
Browse to the content of your stout heart.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.686
What's a doch-an-dorris?

08:38.852 --> 08:42.273
Gaelic for stirrup cup, Robin.

08:42.481 --> 08:46.527
- A drink usually taken on parting.
-You think he wants to get rid of us'?

08:46.736 --> 08:51.907
I think we should try to act
as casual as possible, old chum.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.284
<i>Hmm.</i>

08:55.077 --> 08:57.538
A rare acquisition.

08:58.873 --> 09:04.211
"The key to the Bastille cell block in which
the man in the iron mask was imprisoned."

09:04.420 --> 09:07.339
How could Mr. Ferguson have gotten that?

09:07.757 --> 09:12.803
A golden key opens every lock, Robin.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.933
Shall we?

09:21.312 --> 09:23.731
Holy keyhole.

09:26.859 --> 09:32.364
If there's any dirty work afoot, you can be sure
this key is the hoped-for target.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.824
It must be worth a fortune.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.453
More than a fortune, Boy Wonder.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.954
It's priceless.

09:39.163 --> 09:44.043
And you're right, Batman,
my target is the Jeweled Key of Kaincardine.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.921
Which, luckily,
we will prevent you from obtaining.

09:47.129 --> 09:50.132
Ho-ho! I wonder, Caped Crusader.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.343
I anticipated your presence here today.

09:52.551 --> 09:56.680
And I believe my newest invention
will render you helpless...

09:56.889 --> 10:02.436
...while I transfer ownership
of the priceless jeweled key.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.790
- Are you all right, Robin?
-I think so, Batman. What happened?

10:22.998 --> 10:26.710
- I'm not sure.
-Look, it's gone.

10:27.503 --> 10:30.339
It certainly is gone.

10:30.548 --> 10:32.758
It most certainly is gone.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.636
And if that key is nay found
and returned at once...

10:35.845 --> 10:40.224
...I'll sue this city for $8,000,523
and a threepenny bit.

10:40.391 --> 10:42.893
- But, Mr. Ferguson--
-The charge will be grand larceny.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.188
You'll hear from my law agent
because you can say "Jack McRobinson."

10:46.355 --> 10:50.818
And you, you two muttonheads,
after I offered you a wee doch-an-dorris...

11:00.786 --> 11:04.123
Gotham City still holds you
in great esteem, Dynamic Duo.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.418
The word, uh, "muttonheads"
was most unfortunate.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.211
It was right.

11:09.420 --> 11:14.550
We were standing in that alcove
while the Joker made off with the jeweled key.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.636
It's hard to explain.

11:18.012 --> 11:19.597
What did happen, Batman?

11:19.805 --> 11:23.976
He had some kind of contraption,
a small box with a key.

11:24.185 --> 11:25.561
Which sparked and hummed.

11:25.769 --> 11:29.023
He said it would render us helpless
while he pulled off the robbery.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.733
And it did.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.737
Although, I don't know exactly how yet.

11:34.945 --> 11:38.449
If this device could do that
to the two of you, think--

11:38.657 --> 11:40.159
I have thought, commissioner.

11:40.367 --> 11:45.247
The theft of the Jeweled Key
of Kaincardine...

11:45.414 --> 11:47.791
...is only secondary.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.630
There are many devious tricks
up that crafty clown's sleeve.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.964
He must be stopped...

11:54.173 --> 11:59.386
...before he makes a laughing stock,
not only of Robin and me...

11:59.595 --> 12:02.181
...your fine department...

12:02.389 --> 12:04.808
...but all of Gotham City.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.942
<i>And in conclusion, let me repeat the hope
that Batman and Robin...</i>

12:13.150 --> 12:16.612
<i>...were in no way helping the Joker
steal the Jeweled Key of Kaincardine...</i>

12:16.820 --> 12:18.781
<i>...from Mr. Ferguson's collection today...</i>

12:18.989 --> 12:22.368
<i>...just because the Dynamic Duo
stood by ineffectively.</i>

12:22.576 --> 12:23.911
Ineffectively?

12:24.119 --> 12:26.288
What an unpleasant innuendo.

12:26.497 --> 12:30.751
<i>There is a rumor around Gotham City tonight
that the Joker has some new invention...</i>

12:30.960 --> 12:35.130
<i>...against which the Caped Crusader
and the Boy Wonder are powerless.</i>

12:35.339 --> 12:37.675
Enough of rumors.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.512
<i>It's</i> about time <i>for The Green Hornet.</i>

12:41.679 --> 12:43.639
You're right, Bruce.

12:47.685 --> 12:50.729
<i>Citizens of Gotham City, this is the Joker.</i>

12:52.731 --> 12:56.860
<i>Corning to you through your key station
via my high-powered jamming system...</i>

12:57.069 --> 13:00.447
<i>...and particularly addressing Batman,
wherever you are.</i>

13:00.656 --> 13:06.078
<i>Foiled, failed, frustrated and so defenseless,
I'll even give you a clue to my next crime.</i>

13:06.287 --> 13:09.999
<i>Don't give a hoot for the hobnailed,
but look for a bow and a bobtail.</i>

13:13.877 --> 13:17.923
Joker is in one of his more generous moods
providing us with clues.

13:18.132 --> 13:20.551
Let's provide him with a little action.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.887
To the Batpoles.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.604
In his strange and evil way, Robin...

13:32.813 --> 13:36.567
...the Joker sometimes exhibits
a bit of twisted honesty.

13:36.775 --> 13:42.072
I think we can ignore the first half of the clue
as he suggested...

13:42.281 --> 13:48.037
...and concentrate
on "look for a bow and bobtails."

13:48.203 --> 13:51.498
What do you mean, "twisted honesty"?
He's trying to stomp us, isn't he?

13:51.665 --> 13:55.169
Let's say he wants us
to take his tricky bait the hard way.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.129
Like we did today.

13:57.338 --> 14:00.341
I think I have the solution to that too, Robin.

14:00.549 --> 14:05.304
When he was younger,
the Joker was a well-known hypnotist.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.848
- Holy mesmerism.
-Exactly.

14:08.057 --> 14:09.433
Catching us off-guard...

14:09.641 --> 14:14.313
...and using that ingenious box and key
as a temporary diversion...

14:14.521 --> 14:17.274
...he momentarily had us in his power.

14:17.483 --> 14:23.530
But that's water under the bridge.
Now, "look for a bow and bobtails." A bow.

14:23.906 --> 14:30.204
Bow nut, bowline, bowlegs, Bo Peep--
Rainbow?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.916
No, I suspect there is some other key t--

14:34.124 --> 14:35.459
Key.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.212
Of course. The loop of a key.

14:38.420 --> 14:43.175
The handle is also called a bow.

14:43.384 --> 14:44.426
Now, bobtails.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.888
Bobtailed horse, bobtailed drawbridge.

14:48.097 --> 14:52.726
Bobtailed flush in poker, bobtailed lynx.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.646
Lynx? Cufflinks? A golf course?

14:55.854 --> 14:57.439
L-Y-N-X.

14:57.648 --> 15:02.861
A bobtailed species of wild cat
with a valuable fur varying in color of--

15:03.862 --> 15:04.905
That's it, Robin.

15:05.114 --> 15:11.078
And the way he emphasized
"foiled, failed, frustrated and defenseless."

15:11.286 --> 15:12.788
Sure, Batman.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.125
He must have the key
to Franchin's Fancy Fur Salon. Let's go.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.376
One moment, Robin.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.630
This requires unusual precaution.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.718
Oh, I know diamonds are supposed
to be a girl's best friend...

15:26.927 --> 15:30.139
...but I could get real chummy
with some mink or ermine.

15:30.347 --> 15:33.725
Oh, I'll take three or four of these
and a couple of gorillas.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.353
I think you mean chinchilla, Cornelia.

15:36.562 --> 15:39.273
One of the rarest and most costly of furs.

15:39.481 --> 15:42.276
Oh, well, that's exactly what I mean.

15:42.484 --> 15:46.488
Aren't you afraid we'll get caught
in a place like this, this time of night?

15:46.655 --> 15:48.991
Ha. With my duplicate key
to the manager's office...

15:49.158 --> 15:50.742
...we came through his private entrance.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.369
Which has no burglar alarm.

15:52.578 --> 15:55.205
And Latch and Bolt
are in the front hall, on guard.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.082
Ho-ho! With two recruits. Ha, ha!

15:57.291 --> 15:59.501
But what about the clue
you broadcast to Batman?

15:59.668 --> 16:02.671
Aha. Precisely why I brought
my little magic box.

16:04.256 --> 16:06.383
I'm looking forward
to giving Batman and Robin...

16:06.592 --> 16:08.343
...another taste of its unique power.

16:10.929 --> 16:15.893
- This time the joke's going to be on the Joker.
-So let's get the jump on him.

16:17.060 --> 16:18.562
Ooh! Ho-ho-ho!

16:19.021 --> 16:22.065
Good evening, friends.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.324
Something's wrong.
The key must be broken.

16:30.532 --> 16:34.870
It's not the key to that box that's broken,
Joker, it's your hypnotic power over us.

16:35.454 --> 16:36.830
Well, it worked before.

16:37.039 --> 16:40.959
This time we took our counter-hypnosis
Bat-pellets from our Bat-capsule dispensary.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.046
Latch, Bolt, everybody!

17:33.345 --> 17:35.764
Nothing but some wires and a little battery.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.224
Exactly, Robin.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.394
We didn't give him time to induce hypnosis.

17:40.602 --> 17:46.233
But as I've said, that monstrous mountebank
is full of mad maneuvers.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.613
Would you like me
to bring down some breakfast, sir?

17:51.822 --> 17:55.826
The human body can only go so long
without proper food, drink and sleep.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.869
It's only been one night, Alfred.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.664
And we have to trap the Joker
once and for all.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.333
If I might suggest a thought, sir?

18:03.542 --> 18:04.585
Oh, please, do.

18:04.793 --> 18:09.631
It struck me that recently most of his messages
have involved twists on words.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.883
Wordplays on keys, particularly.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.594
Now, if in his private life--

18:13.802 --> 18:15.721
Precisely the course
we've been pursuing, Alfred.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.473
Robin, what have you come up with?

18:19.016 --> 18:24.396
Keyboard, key bugle, key fruit,
keynote address...

18:24.605 --> 18:27.441
...key signature, Keystone State.

18:27.608 --> 18:31.236
Uh, by "private life,"
I meant a change of identity.

18:31.445 --> 18:33.322
Possibly an assumed name.

18:33.530 --> 18:36.658
- Holy pseudonym.
-Of course, Alfred, why didn't we think of that?

18:36.867 --> 18:39.453
Would you mind handing me
the telephone directory?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.538
- Here you are, sir.
-Thank you.

18:41.747 --> 18:45.834
I programmed a Batcomputer feedback circuit
to isolate key name metaphors...

18:46.043 --> 18:49.713
...in the greater Gotham City
telephone directory.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.590
It's gotta be one of these.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.133
Mrs. Carrie B. Keypin.

18:53.342 --> 18:57.137
No, I don't think he'd
be masquerading as a woman.

18:57.346 --> 19:00.349
- The Locker Room?
-An English grill I occasionally frequent.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.684
Superb suet pudding.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.978
Louie Latch?

19:06.480 --> 19:09.191
What about this one? Clavier Ankh.

19:09.399 --> 19:13.904
- Clavier Ankh? What kind of a name is that?
-A very revealing name, Robin.

19:14.112 --> 19:17.407
The clavier is the keyboard of an organ.

19:17.616 --> 19:23.038
An ankh is a sacred Egyptian cross
symbolizing the key of life.

19:23.246 --> 19:24.331
Gosh, Batman.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.582
And the address.

19:25.791 --> 19:28.460
"Number 1, Dugan Alley."

19:28.669 --> 19:30.462
That's worthy of note.

19:36.093 --> 19:38.303
-It's a cool pad, Joker.
-Ha.

19:38.512 --> 19:43.141
All you've seen of this cool pad, Cornelia,
is that mirror. Vanity is a waste of time.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.185
I never look at myself.

19:45.811 --> 19:48.313
Well, I'm younger, Joker, and a girl.

19:48.522 --> 19:49.815
And it is a cool pad.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.651
Well, it will do for the purpose.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.195
Do you think Batman's
smart enough to find it?

19:55.404 --> 19:58.824
Oh, he's an adversary
almost worthy of me, Cornelia...

19:59.032 --> 20:01.368
...but soon will only be the skeleton of one.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.417
And sooner than I planned, in fact.
There's the Batmobile now.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.336
The Dynamic Duo are somewhat
unorthodox, Cornelia.

20:11.503 --> 20:14.381
No doubt they'll come up the outside wall.
You know what to do.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.466
And Latch and Bolt are waiting to help...

20:16.633 --> 20:20.011
...while Uncle Clavier double-checks
his Human Key Duplicator.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.388
You mean a real live one?

20:21.555 --> 20:23.140
Uh, you'll see, Cornelia.

20:23.348 --> 20:27.060
Oh, at last the end of Batman and Robin
is in sight.

20:27.269 --> 20:31.565
And I can start planning
the craftiest caper of my career.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.870
Your, uh, daily workout, Batman?

20:45.078 --> 20:47.581
Yes. Crime-fighters have to stay in shape.

20:47.789 --> 20:50.500
- But you know that.
-Well, my job is a little easier.

20:50.709 --> 20:53.628
Sometimes a fast gun has the edge
on a fast Bat-rope.

20:54.004 --> 20:57.507
I'm not invading your territory.
I'm just tracking down a clue incognito.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.384
Welcome and good luck.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.679
If you need help, locate us
through Commissioner Gordon's office.

21:02.888 --> 21:04.681
The Batphone number is unlisted.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.933
Smart thinking.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.317
Don't slip.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.028
Brave men, Jim.

21:26.203 --> 21:27.329
You startled me.

21:27.662 --> 21:28.955
I'm sorry, young lady.

21:29.164 --> 21:34.544
We're here to pay Mr. Clavier Ankh
a little unexpected visit.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.254
This is his apartment, isn't it?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.840
Uncle Clavier is in the, uh, library.

21:39.049 --> 21:41.301
May I ask who's calling?

21:41.802 --> 21:43.470
Batman and Robin.

21:43.678 --> 21:44.888
Oh, yes.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.057
This way, please.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.853
Girl from the fur salon.

21:52.062 --> 21:54.356
I'm afraid this could be a trap, Batman.

21:54.564 --> 21:58.693
He who knows how to fear, Robin,
knows how to proceed with safety.

21:58.902 --> 22:01.238
A translation from the Latin.

22:03.657 --> 22:07.869
Maybe I should have told you,
the library is in the cellar.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.672
To make this Human Key Duplicator...

22:18.880 --> 22:22.425
...I also made some brilliant changes
and innovations.

22:22.634 --> 22:26.888
But I'm sure you understand
the basic principles, Batman.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.267
You are in this vise.

22:30.475 --> 22:33.436
A duplicate blank key is in this vise.

22:33.645 --> 22:38.275
And when I activate the motor
and the vises start turning...

22:38.608 --> 22:43.738
...that cutting blade
will do its grooviest work on you.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.157
You monster.

22:46.992 --> 22:51.621
A grown man like me should be prepared
to meet his maker at any time...

22:52.080 --> 22:54.624
...but not a boy like Robin.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.502
What diabolical plan do you have for him?

22:57.711 --> 22:59.379
First a wax spray job.

22:59.588 --> 23:03.800
Somewhat similar to what you get
when you have the Batmobile washed.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.761
It takes a week or so
for the wax to harden properly.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.847
Until then, who knows?

23:09.055 --> 23:13.101
A notched key for a lock
with many wards, hmm?

23:13.310 --> 23:16.187
Do I have to watch all this, Joker?
The reflection is icky.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.065
Oh, not if it makes you
squeamish, Cornelia.

23:19.274 --> 23:22.152
All right, to the Wax Spray Chamber
for the Boy Wonder.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.617
Start with a light spray.

23:30.285 --> 23:34.956
When every pore in his body is filled with wax,
we'll apply a heavier coating.

23:36.499 --> 23:41.504
Let's get the skeletonizing process over with,
Batman, while you're all keyed up.

23:41.713 --> 23:44.132
Have you a last word for posterity?

23:44.341 --> 23:45.467
Only this, Joker.

23:45.675 --> 23:50.931
Evil sometimes triumphs temporarily,
but never conquers.

23:51.139 --> 23:56.061
If I have time, Batman, I'll see that
that is properly engraved on your tombstone.

23:56.394 --> 23:57.479
In the meantime...
