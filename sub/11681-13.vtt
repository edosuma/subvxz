00:00.513 --> 00:04.147
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.737 --> 00:07.272
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.708
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.776 --> 00:12.370
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.374 --> 00:14.642
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:16.677
Where am I?
Miami.

00:16.745 --> 00:19.814
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.882 --> 00:22.383
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.451 --> 00:23.951
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.019 --> 00:25.586
Should we shoot them?

00:25.654 --> 00:28.156
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.223 --> 00:30.491
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.559 --> 00:32.994
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.061 --> 00:35.129
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help,</i>
<i>Michael.</i>

00:35.197 --> 00:37.565
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.633 --> 00:39.200
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:42.571 --> 00:43.971
<i>Previously on "Burn Notice"...</i>

00:44.039 --> 00:46.474
They took Becky
right out of the backyard.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.675
I know
exactly who did it.

00:47.743 --> 00:48.910
Tell him
if he wants his girl,

00:48.977 --> 00:51.145
get my brother out of jail.

00:51.213 --> 00:53.047
Son of a bitch!
That's not him!

00:55.818 --> 00:57.552
You think
you can do this to me?!

00:57.619 --> 00:59.587
He's a little angry.
I'm angry, too.

00:59.655 --> 01:02.056
So what now?
The situation hasn't changed.

01:02.124 --> 01:04.391
Everything leads back
to John Barrett.

01:04.459 --> 01:06.127
We found Barrett.
He's in Miami.

01:06.195 --> 01:08.463
We grab him,
and we ask him some questions.

01:08.530 --> 01:10.131
Jesse vowed
to put a bullet in you.

01:10.199 --> 01:12.600
That should put him
at the top of your to-do list.

01:12.668 --> 01:14.435
There's not a whole lot
I can do about that right now.

01:14.503 --> 01:15.837
Let's talk about my bible.

01:15.904 --> 01:17.872
If you want the bible,
Mr. Barrett,

01:17.940 --> 01:20.107
you will meet me at Donner Key,
noon Tuesday.

01:20.175 --> 01:21.676
That can be arranged.

01:21.743 --> 01:22.944
So that list is the key

01:23.011 --> 01:24.645
to destroying the people
who burned me?

01:28.250 --> 01:29.717
Take him!

01:29.785 --> 01:32.186
He shot Michael!
What is Jesse doing?!

01:32.254 --> 01:33.454
No, he shot
the guy <i>behind</i> him.

01:33.522 --> 01:34.856
He's saving Mike's butt
is what he's doing.

01:35.958 --> 01:37.892
Who do you work for?!

01:37.960 --> 01:38.793
I'm self-employed.

<i>Are we to believe, then,</i>

02:04.520 --> 02:06.888
<i>that the C.E.O. of a major</i>
<i>telecommunications company</i>

02:06.955 --> 02:09.190
<i>stood at the center</i>
<i>of some sort of cabal --</i>

02:09.258 --> 02:11.192
<i>a conspiracy to profit</i>

02:11.260 --> 02:13.027
<i>civil unrest, terror abroad,</i>

02:13.095 --> 02:15.596
<i>and the United States</i>
<i>intelligence community</i>

02:15.664 --> 02:17.298
<i>knew nothing about it?</i>

02:17.366 --> 02:19.333
<i>Yes.</i>

02:19.401 --> 02:21.235
<i>Spies live in the shadows,</i>

02:21.303 --> 02:22.870
<i>but they dream of the light.</i>

02:22.938 --> 02:25.039
<i>When you're working covert ops</i>
<i>for low pay</i>

02:25.107 --> 02:26.841
<i>in life-threatening conditions,</i>

02:26.909 --> 02:29.877
<i>the idea that your work</i>
<i>won't remain secret forever</i>

02:29.945 --> 02:31.412
<i>keeps you going.</i>

02:31.480 --> 02:33.915
<i>One day the world</i>
<i>will learn what you've done,</i>

02:33.982 --> 02:35.950
<i>even if your name</i>
<i>is never known.</i>

02:36.018 --> 02:38.586
<i>Some of the sweetest moments</i>
<i>come when the job ends</i>

02:38.654 --> 02:40.254
<i>and the bullets stop flying.</i>

02:40.322 --> 02:41.789
<i>That is,</i>

02:41.857 --> 02:45.059
<i>unless one of those bullets</i>
<i>rips through your chest.</i>

02:54.469 --> 02:57.104
It's been three days.

03:00.842 --> 03:03.945
Enough already.

03:04.012 --> 03:05.680
Get up!

03:07.516 --> 03:09.450
W-where am I?

03:09.518 --> 03:10.585
Miami.

03:10.652 --> 03:13.054
Mount Sinai Hospital.

03:13.121 --> 03:15.756
You had two surgeries.
You lost a lot of blood.

03:15.824 --> 03:17.391
The doctors here
saved your life.

03:17.459 --> 03:19.794
They said you're lucky that the
bullet didn't hit your heart.

03:19.861 --> 03:21.195
It's a good thing
it's so small.

03:21.263 --> 03:23.698
I was shot?

03:23.765 --> 03:25.132
And you were
in a car crash.

03:26.702 --> 03:28.402
Michael,
John Barrett is dead.

03:28.470 --> 03:30.071
Yeah?

03:30.138 --> 03:31.906
Sam and I
were at the scene.

03:31.974 --> 03:33.474
I thought you were,
um...

03:36.178 --> 03:38.679
Anyway, the briefcase
with Simon's bible

03:38.747 --> 03:41.482
and Barrett's encrypted data --
it's missing.

03:41.550 --> 03:42.583
It wasn't there.

03:42.651 --> 03:45.753
We have to get that back.

03:45.821 --> 03:47.655
What was it?
Did he tell you?

03:47.723 --> 03:50.291
Barrett had a NOC list
he couldn't decode --

03:50.359 --> 03:53.628
cover I.D.s
of all the people who burned me.

03:54.963 --> 03:56.430
Can you give me
the water?

03:56.498 --> 03:59.133
Michael,
with something like that,

03:59.201 --> 04:02.403
you... could destroy
the people who burned you.

04:02.471 --> 04:04.205
Exactly.

04:12.881 --> 04:16.283
Someone's here
to see you.

04:16.351 --> 04:19.053
I'll, uh, leave you two
alone to talk.

04:23.191 --> 04:25.226
So...

04:26.828 --> 04:28.062
How you feeling?

04:28.130 --> 04:30.798
Not great.
You shot me.

04:30.866 --> 04:33.634
Well, I was trying
to save your life.

04:33.702 --> 04:37.071
Shooting through you to do it
was just a... perk.

04:37.139 --> 04:38.673
Why did you come back,
Jess?

04:40.008 --> 04:41.342
Job wasn't finished.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.044
Well, it still isn't.

04:43.111 --> 04:44.478
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

04:44.546 --> 04:47.381
Uh, Sam told me about
your burn-notice friends.

04:50.052 --> 04:52.119
Read through some of the stuff
that's been done in your name.

04:52.187 --> 04:53.587
It's a pretty nasty bunch
you're tied up with.

05:00.529 --> 05:03.230
I'm gonna take them down,
Jess.

05:03.298 --> 05:05.366
I could use some help.

05:05.434 --> 05:07.501
Oh-ho.
I get to <i>help</i> you.

05:07.569 --> 05:10.471
The people who burned me
don't save kittens from trees.

05:10.539 --> 05:12.907
The guy who did most of this --
Simon Escher --

05:12.974 --> 05:14.341
he's got a list of names.

05:14.409 --> 05:16.677
That's what was
in Barrett's briefcase.

05:16.745 --> 05:18.612
You know,
we recover that,

05:18.680 --> 05:20.815
maybe --
maybe we can get you back in.

05:20.882 --> 05:22.049
Hey, don't, don't.

05:22.117 --> 05:24.485
Don't game me, Michael.
Never again.

05:24.553 --> 05:26.754
I'm gonna help you find this list
'cause it's the right thing to do

05:26.822 --> 05:28.889
and 'cause I want to have a say
in what we do with it.

05:28.957 --> 05:31.625
So I can count on you?

05:33.328 --> 05:35.730
That's a hell of a question
coming from you.

05:53.901 --> 05:55.535
Ma, I wasn't
shot in the leg.

05:55.603 --> 05:57.937
You know, Michael, you need
to get used to listening to me

05:58.005 --> 05:59.339
'cause you'll be staying
at the house

05:59.406 --> 06:00.807
while you're recuperating.

06:00.874 --> 06:02.875
I don't think
that's <i>really</i> a good idea.

06:02.943 --> 06:04.811
And don't argue with me.
Fiona can't take you in.

06:04.878 --> 06:07.080
All right? She's in the middle
of some big move.

06:07.147 --> 06:09.916
Got termites in her apartment
or something. I don't know.

06:09.984 --> 06:12.652
There's plenty of room in the
garage now that Jesse's gone.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.987
What's can't I just stay
in my loft?

06:14.054 --> 06:15.722
Those stairs?

06:15.789 --> 06:17.857
<i>I</i> could beat <i>you</i>
<i>in a 40-yard dash right now.</i>

06:17.925 --> 06:19.926
Just let me take care
of my boy, all right?

06:19.994 --> 06:22.462
You had us scared.

06:22.529 --> 06:24.530
All right. Okay.

06:24.598 --> 06:25.999
Thank you, mom.

06:27.801 --> 06:30.503
Michael,
when's this gonna stop?

06:30.571 --> 06:32.071
You almost died.

06:32.139 --> 06:33.806
Woman over P.A.:
<i>Code orange. Code orange.</i>

06:33.874 --> 06:35.341
<i>All available doctors</i>
<i>and security personnel</i>

06:35.409 --> 06:36.776
<i>to the E.R. immediately.</i>

06:36.844 --> 06:38.811
Stay here.

06:41.515 --> 06:43.416
Sam.

06:43.484 --> 06:44.851
What happened?
Why is security paged?

06:44.918 --> 06:46.152
Well,
it's just procedure.

06:46.220 --> 06:47.854
There was an explosion
on Ocean Drive --

06:47.921 --> 06:49.522
four people dead,
six in critical condition.

06:49.590 --> 06:51.024
Police have any idea
who's behind it?

06:51.091 --> 06:53.326
Well, preliminary guess
is it's just a gas leak.

06:53.394 --> 06:55.728
But come on, Mike.
With everything that's been going on lately?

06:55.796 --> 06:57.730
We need to talk to somebody
who was there. Yeah.

07:03.270 --> 07:06.205
Sam, these people
are in shock.

07:06.273 --> 07:08.641
Let's just try one more,
Mikey.

07:10.277 --> 07:11.811
Oh, excuse me, miss?

07:11.879 --> 07:13.980
Alicia Rensin.
I'm here for my brother Walt.

07:14.048 --> 07:15.648
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't work here.

07:15.716 --> 07:17.517
But we just saw --
I mean, were you there?

07:17.584 --> 07:18.651
Are you all right?

07:18.719 --> 07:19.886
Uh, yeah.

07:19.953 --> 07:22.655
But my brother
might have lost his hearing.

07:22.723 --> 07:24.157
What happened?

07:24.224 --> 07:25.525
I don't know.

07:25.592 --> 07:27.260
I...

07:27.328 --> 07:30.029
Walt was, uh, having lunch
with his -- with his boss.

07:30.097 --> 07:32.999
And I-I went
to get his signature

07:33.067 --> 07:34.767
on this field-trip form.

07:34.835 --> 07:37.437
I watch the kids
since Gina left.

07:37.504 --> 07:38.738
And, um...

07:38.806 --> 07:42.075
And, uh,
Walt was coming out.

07:42.142 --> 07:43.309
And I looked over,

07:43.377 --> 07:45.511
and -- and I saw this --
this young couple.

07:48.215 --> 07:49.615
And then it went off.

07:49.683 --> 07:52.418
And they weren't there
anymore.

07:52.486 --> 07:55.655
I don't think
this was an accident.

07:55.723 --> 07:58.391
I told Walt not to work
for a slimebag like Dale.

07:58.459 --> 08:00.526
It was a matter of time
before something like this.

08:00.594 --> 08:01.461
Dale?

08:03.063 --> 08:04.297
Dale Lawson.

08:04.365 --> 08:06.833
This guy my brother
works for.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.568
He's dead.

08:08.635 --> 08:10.903
Walt's no angel,
but he didn't deserve this.

08:10.971 --> 08:13.539
The cops better find out
who did this.

08:13.607 --> 08:15.274
<i>Someone's</i> got to
bring them to justice.

08:15.342 --> 08:16.809
Someone will.

08:16.877 --> 08:18.778
Excuse me.
Your brother's asking for you.

08:24.718 --> 08:27.553
Adam Scott.
You're thinking it too, right?

08:27.621 --> 08:29.355
Dale kidnapped his daughter.

08:29.423 --> 08:31.324
Would be
one hell of a coincidence.

08:31.392 --> 08:32.892
You told him
to get out of town.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.693
He promised
that he would drop it.

08:34.761 --> 08:36.462
Yeah. He's a lawyer.
I guess I should have got it in writing.

08:36.530 --> 08:37.797
Wait -- didn't Scott say

08:37.865 --> 08:39.899
that he wanted
Lawson's whole crew to pay?

08:39.967 --> 08:41.267
This could be
just the beginning, Mike,

08:41.335 --> 08:43.236
like a declaration of war --
okay, what are you doing?

08:43.303 --> 08:44.504
The doctor
said two weeks.

08:44.571 --> 08:45.938
I'm fine.

08:46.006 --> 08:47.707
It's time
to get back to work.

08:53.113 --> 08:54.614
Michael,
I know you're upset,

08:54.681 --> 08:55.782
but what's the play here?

08:55.849 --> 08:57.383
From the looks
of all these S.U.V.s,

08:57.451 --> 08:58.718
Scott stepped up
his security.

08:58.786 --> 08:59.852
We're just gonna talk.

09:01.188 --> 09:03.222
You think he's just gonna
let go of his vendetta

09:03.290 --> 09:04.590
because we ask politely?

09:04.658 --> 09:06.392
We'll tell Scott
we're onto him.

09:06.460 --> 09:09.662
If he's smart, he'll call off
anything else he's got planned.

09:09.730 --> 09:12.432
Buys us some time
to turn the police onto this.

09:12.499 --> 09:14.734
And I didn't say
we'd be polite.

09:16.770 --> 09:17.804
Mr. Westen.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.442
Ms. Glenanne.

09:22.509 --> 09:24.477
I-I wasn't expecting...

09:24.545 --> 09:26.479
What happened to you?

09:26.547 --> 09:28.481
Oh, this?
Oh, this is nothing.

09:28.549 --> 09:31.384
It's not like I almost
got blown up on South Beach.

09:31.452 --> 09:34.153
Are you referring
to that explosion?

09:34.221 --> 09:36.889
Three days after you told me
Dale Lawson is a dead man,

09:36.957 --> 09:38.858
Dale Lawson
<i>is</i> a dead man.

09:38.926 --> 09:42.094
Well, I was at the pool bar
at the Delano with 200 people

09:42.162 --> 09:43.396
when that happened.

09:43.464 --> 09:47.934
23 hours a day
you're holed up here,

09:48.001 --> 09:49.869
and just then you happened
to be grabbing a beer?

09:49.937 --> 09:50.970
Is that a joke?

09:51.038 --> 09:52.939
It's called an alibi.

09:53.006 --> 09:54.340
Innocent people are dead

09:54.408 --> 09:56.843
because you had to have
your revenge.

09:56.910 --> 10:00.279
Don't smile at us.

10:00.347 --> 10:02.949
The man
kidnapped my little girl.

10:03.016 --> 10:05.751
You know, I wish --
I wish I <i>had</i> killed him.

10:05.819 --> 10:08.988
I wish I had been there
to watch him burn.

10:10.724 --> 10:12.558
But I didn't do it.

10:12.626 --> 10:14.894
Of course not.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.395
A man with your clientele,

10:16.463 --> 10:19.198
I'm sure you could shake
a bomber out of your sleeve.

10:19.266 --> 10:20.633
Well, whoever it was,

10:20.701 --> 10:23.202
I'm hoping
they're just getting started.

10:23.270 --> 10:24.971
I mean,
Lawson's got a big crew.

10:25.038 --> 10:26.405
He doesn't seem
to be getting it.

10:26.473 --> 10:27.840
If another
innocent person --

10:27.908 --> 10:30.443
if you're all out of
baseless allegations,

10:30.511 --> 10:32.512
I'd like to kindly ask you to
get the hell out of my house.

10:32.579 --> 10:33.646
Aah!

10:33.714 --> 10:36.249
Hands to yourself.
We're leaving.

10:36.316 --> 10:39.986
Go be with your daughter.
Enjoy the time.

10:40.053 --> 10:42.822
Prison visits
are hard on kids.

10:55.435 --> 10:57.370
One minute.

10:59.406 --> 11:02.675
Then you never
have to see me again -- ever --

11:02.743 --> 11:03.910
if you don't want to.

11:05.913 --> 11:08.114
Next time you show up
unannounced,

11:08.181 --> 11:09.682
<i>nobody</i> will ever
see you again.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.117
You coming to apologize,
Vaughn?

11:11.184 --> 11:14.287
Yeah. That and, uh, tell you
to keep your head down.

11:14.354 --> 11:18.658
The investigation, the media --
it's a fire storm.

11:18.725 --> 11:19.926
Yeah, I saw the news.

11:19.993 --> 11:21.761
Fortune 500 C.E.O.
turns up dead

11:21.828 --> 11:23.729
in the middle of a giant mess
<i>you</i> made.

11:23.797 --> 11:25.631
I guess there was
no cleaning <i>that</i> up.

11:25.699 --> 11:28.401
No, it was time
to let nature take its course.

11:28.468 --> 11:31.070
We had leaked all the intel
on Drake's overseas operations

11:31.138 --> 11:33.272
into legitimate
intelligence sources.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.174
Although
it would have been nice

11:35.242 --> 11:37.476
to know why Barrett
wanted that bible first.

11:37.544 --> 11:38.644
He's dead.

11:38.712 --> 11:39.845
I don't see
how it really matters.

11:39.913 --> 11:42.815
Point is, we need
to keep a low profile.

11:42.883 --> 11:44.317
I'm leaving Miami.

11:44.384 --> 11:46.452
I don't get that option,
do I?

11:48.088 --> 11:50.523
Well, then, Michael, I guess
it's time to say goodbye.

11:50.591 --> 11:53.793
Someone new will be in touch
when the dust settles.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.097
Be good.

12:03.770 --> 12:06.172
So that's
how the devil disappears.

12:06.239 --> 12:09.775
I'm a little disappointed
there wasn't a puff of smoke.

12:09.843 --> 12:11.277
Well,
don't get too excited.

12:11.345 --> 12:13.646
You heard him.
He still has plans for me.

12:13.714 --> 12:15.815
Well, I have bigger plans
for <i>them.</i>

12:15.882 --> 12:16.882
Here, sit down.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.384
I don't want
to get your hopes up,

12:18.452 --> 12:20.252
but Sam and I think we know
who took the NOC list.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.621
Go ahead.
Get my hopes up.

12:23.423 --> 12:24.757
Well...

12:24.825 --> 12:27.793
Barrett's security team were
the only other people there.

12:27.861 --> 12:29.128
Sam had a theory --

12:29.196 --> 12:32.131
one of them sees
a shiny briefcase on the street.

12:32.199 --> 12:33.532
Crime of opportunity.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.434
Is this just a theory?

12:35.502 --> 12:38.371
Every member of Barrett's team
is dead or back to work

12:38.438 --> 12:39.572
except one.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.140
Mark Sweeney is missing.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.241
Sweeney?

12:42.309 --> 12:44.477
Doesn't exactly sound

12:44.544 --> 12:46.846
like a supervillain's,
you know, cool name.

12:46.913 --> 12:49.081
Eh,
he's just a former merc.

12:49.149 --> 12:52.218
He worked security
for Drake's Miami Office.

12:52.285 --> 12:54.520
Poor fella probably doesn't even
know what he grabbed.

12:54.588 --> 12:57.323
Well, right now, the priority is
finding the South Beach bomber.

12:57.391 --> 12:58.791
Oh, that hurt.

12:58.859 --> 13:00.860
I'm gonna go
track him first.

13:07.134 --> 13:08.267
So, your buddy
at the court

13:08.335 --> 13:09.802
thinks this guy
is our best bet?

13:09.870 --> 13:11.303
He's our <i>only</i> bet.

13:11.371 --> 13:13.973
Scott represents lots of creeps
but only one bomber --

13:14.041 --> 13:15.141
Dennis Barfield.

13:15.208 --> 13:16.575
You know,
reasonable doubt aside,

13:16.643 --> 13:18.210
Dennis blew up a drug den
in Overtown.

13:18.278 --> 13:19.545
He's crazy, Mike.

13:19.613 --> 13:22.748
Well, if blowing up a drug den
means you're insane...

13:22.816 --> 13:25.718
Uh, court-ordered psych
evaluation, admitted at trial.

13:25.786 --> 13:27.853
I mean,
you got clinical narcissism,

13:27.921 --> 13:29.755
paranoia,
delusions of grandeur.

13:29.823 --> 13:32.024
All right, he's insane.
Yeah, but there's more.

13:32.092 --> 13:34.527
He's been questioned in three
separate homeless killings.

13:34.594 --> 13:37.663
See, Dennis has a lot to say
about "degenerates" and "scum."

13:37.731 --> 13:39.131
You know,
you get a sense

13:39.199 --> 13:41.233
that there's a manifesto
in the works.

13:41.301 --> 13:42.301
Wh-- are you crazy?

13:42.369 --> 13:43.736
What did we
just talk about?

13:43.804 --> 13:45.271
I'm not gonna
introduce myself.

13:45.338 --> 13:48.007
I just want to find evidence
Dennis set the bomb yesterday

13:48.075 --> 13:49.442
and turn this mess
over to the police.

13:50.944 --> 13:52.878
I never thought I would hear
those words from <i>you.</i>

13:52.946 --> 13:56.582
I never had to walk around
with hole in my clavicle before.

13:56.650 --> 13:58.317
Keep an eye out.

14:05.926 --> 14:09.095
How does a delusional killer
afford a place like this?

14:09.162 --> 14:10.796
Well, Dennis
is a trust-fund psycho.

14:10.864 --> 14:12.331
He never worked a day
in his life.

14:12.399 --> 14:14.934
I feel like you're leaving out
the good parts about this guy.

14:15.001 --> 14:16.769
Well, he doesn't have
any parking tickets.

14:16.837 --> 14:18.904
We got some epoxy,
a tank of gas.

14:18.972 --> 14:20.239
So the guy's either
a bomber

14:20.307 --> 14:22.374
or a model-airplane
enthusiast.

14:22.442 --> 14:23.576
It's not enough, bud.

14:23.643 --> 14:25.244
There's powder residue here.

14:25.312 --> 14:27.446
Oh, might be
the proof we need.

14:27.514 --> 14:29.415
<i>The site of a break-in</i>
<i>is like a broken bone.</i>

14:29.483 --> 14:31.684
<i>Years later, the spot will have</i>
<i>either been made stronger</i>

14:31.752 --> 14:33.219
<i>or weaker by the ordeal.</i>

14:33.286 --> 14:34.754
<i>A replacement window pane</i>

14:34.821 --> 14:37.156
<i>installed with putty</i>
<i>and weather stripping</i>

14:37.224 --> 14:39.825
<i>costs about 10 cents</i>
<i>to remove.</i>

14:47.067 --> 14:48.601
Uh, hope you're done
in there, bud,

14:48.668 --> 14:49.835
'cause you are done
in there.

14:49.903 --> 14:51.403
Dennis is coming?

14:51.471 --> 14:53.839
Yeah, I think we should call him
"Dennis Wayne Barfield,"

14:53.907 --> 14:57.076
you know, just to give him
that, uh, serial-killer flavor.

14:57.144 --> 15:00.045
I'll meet you around back
in five minutes, Sam.

15:00.113 --> 15:01.747
Yeah.

15:04.184 --> 15:05.718
<i>You need confidence</i>
<i>and a can-do attitude</i>

15:05.786 --> 15:07.219
<i>to make it in the field.</i>

15:07.287 --> 15:09.021
<i>But if you don't have</i>
<i>the physical strength</i>

15:09.089 --> 15:10.589
<i>to match your attitude,</i>

15:10.657 --> 15:14.393
<i>that confidence can</i>
<i>just as easily get you killed.</i>

15:14.461 --> 15:17.963
Excuse me, scumbag.

15:18.031 --> 15:20.366
You just picked
the wrong guy to rob.

15:23.737 --> 15:25.704
I wasn't trying to rob you.

15:27.908 --> 15:30.242
No sale!

15:30.310 --> 15:33.612
No sale.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.582
Look at me.

15:36.650 --> 15:39.952
Do I look
like some dirtbag thief?

15:40.020 --> 15:43.255
I know what I saw.

15:43.323 --> 15:46.792
<i>You</i> are one of <i>them.</i>

15:46.860 --> 15:49.328
Part of the rot

15:49.396 --> 15:51.764
that makes it
so I can't go outside

15:51.832 --> 15:53.999
without needing a shower.

15:55.969 --> 15:57.636
Now get off my backdrop.

15:57.704 --> 15:59.538
I don't want
to make a mess.

16:01.007 --> 16:02.741
Not again. Not again.

16:02.809 --> 16:04.610
Are you off?!

16:04.678 --> 16:07.112
Look at me.

16:07.180 --> 16:08.848
I tried to take out
one of the dealers,

16:08.915 --> 16:10.416
and they shot me
and left me to die.

16:10.483 --> 16:12.418
You want to finish
what they started? Go ahead.

16:14.621 --> 16:18.657
<i>Don't</i> lump me in
with petty criminals.

16:18.725 --> 16:21.427
No, I'm not.

16:21.494 --> 16:23.095
I wanted a closer look.

16:23.163 --> 16:25.931
I'm your biggest fan.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.266
A f-- a fan?

16:27.334 --> 16:29.568
My name is Gordon Lutz,

16:29.636 --> 16:31.704
and I've been following
your work since your trial.

16:31.805 --> 16:34.240
I'm a photography student.

16:34.307 --> 16:35.307
No.

16:35.375 --> 16:36.909
Your work.
I read the papers.

16:36.977 --> 16:38.777
After this last thing
on South Beach,

16:38.845 --> 16:40.012
I just had to meet you.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.014
That's all.

16:42.082 --> 16:43.349
Please.

16:43.416 --> 16:45.951
Please put the gun down.

16:46.019 --> 16:48.287
I was acquitted
at my trial.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.456
<i>I</i> did not do
anything wrong.

16:50.523 --> 16:51.624
Of course you didn't.

16:53.727 --> 16:56.462
You took out
those degenerates.

16:56.529 --> 16:58.631
You are an inspiration.

16:58.698 --> 17:02.134
And I could learn
so much from you.

17:02.202 --> 17:03.669
I'm sure you could,
Gordon.

17:08.508 --> 17:11.242
But that's not
gonna happen.

17:14.714 --> 17:18.217
Now, <i>if</i> you come back,

17:18.285 --> 17:19.685
I <i>will</i> put another hole
in you.

17:22.321 --> 17:24.089
But keep reading the papers,
Gordon.

17:24.156 --> 17:25.991
There's more to love
coming soon.

17:34.506 --> 17:36.506
You were suppose to take your
Percocet two hours ago.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.890
I'm fine.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.959
Funny, I don't remember
you moaning this much

17:41.026 --> 17:42.493
<i>before</i> you got shot.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.596
I can't be on pain medication
if I'm going to be...

17:46.031 --> 17:49.667
...In situations
I'm going to be in.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.902
You're not supposed to
be working!

17:50.970 --> 17:52.503
You've got to let
your body heal, Michael!

17:52.571 --> 17:54.572
Mom, the explosion
in South Beach --

17:54.640 --> 17:55.506
it was a bomb.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.642
We know who did it.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.077
You don't want more
innocent people hurt, do you?

18:00.679 --> 18:03.147
You better
look out for him.

18:03.215 --> 18:06.150
She's right
to be concerned, Michael.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.519
Why the hell didn't you run
when Dennis was coming?

18:08.587 --> 18:09.587
Didn't Sam warn you?!

18:09.655 --> 18:12.857
It was a judgment call.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.027
Making contact
gives us an angle

18:16.095 --> 18:19.664
to draw him out
when Sam and I go back.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.366
<i>That's</i> your plan?

18:21.433 --> 18:23.534
To re-approach a guy
who said he'd kill you

18:23.602 --> 18:25.103
if he ever saw you again?

18:25.170 --> 18:27.572
It's only to distract Dennis
while Sam searches the place.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.642
And besides,
why would an insane narcissist

18:30.709 --> 18:32.277
kill his biggest fan?

18:32.344 --> 18:34.946
I have a cute little walther.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.547
Dennis said
there was more to come.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.916
And we have to know more
about what he has planned.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.685
Shooting him's
just not the right move.

18:42.521 --> 18:43.488
Yet.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.089
Yet.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.724
I have some news
about the NOC list.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.027
Sweeney's car turned up
abandoned in a tow-away zone.

18:49.094 --> 18:50.662
It's sitting
in a police impound.

18:50.729 --> 18:52.130
Think he left
anything in it,

18:52.197 --> 18:53.831
give us an idea
of where he got off to?

18:53.899 --> 18:55.400
I'm gonna go take a look.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.567
You should take Jesse with you.
Oh, Michael.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.735
Look, I'm banged up,

18:57.803 --> 18:59.671
and my hands
are full as it is.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.706
You know
you could use some help.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.908
Do a job together.
He'll forgive you.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.710
It always worked
for you and me.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.813
I don't want relationship advice
from you today.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.827
Jesse. Hi.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.129
Hi. Ready to go?

19:25.197 --> 19:26.964
Impound closes at 1:00
on Saturdays.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.467
Oh. Well, then we have time
for a drink.

19:29.535 --> 19:32.103
I know I have wine glasses
in here somewhere.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.373
Or better yet,
I will find my boxing gloves.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.008
Maybe if you punch me
in the head a few times,

19:37.076 --> 19:38.509
we can turn the page.

19:38.577 --> 19:41.946
Look, what do you want from me,
Fiona? You lied to me.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.082
What I want is for things to go
back to the way they were before.

19:44.149 --> 19:45.516
Okay, we worked together.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.251
That's how it was before.
Let's go.

19:48.887 --> 19:51.923
You know what?

19:51.990 --> 19:54.959
While we're bribing our way in,
you're my husband.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.028
Okay, then.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.629
Our marriage
is on the rocks.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.668
<i>Bribery's a delicate art.</i>

20:03.736 --> 20:07.572
<i>Success often depends less on</i>
<i>how much cash you offer</i>

20:07.639 --> 20:09.807
<i>and more on how you offer it.</i>

20:09.875 --> 20:11.509
Officer. Hi.
How you doing?

20:11.577 --> 20:14.579
My wife left her sunglasses
in my friend Mark's car.

20:14.646 --> 20:17.148
It's a Nissan Altima.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.883
It's right over there. I can see it.
I'm afraid I can't let --

20:18.951 --> 20:20.718
not that she can tell me what
she was doing in Mark's car.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.453
Don't start
with me, Teddy!

20:22.521 --> 20:23.721
Oh, I'm starting!
I'm starting!

20:23.789 --> 20:25.056
I already started,
and I'm gonna finish.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.058
<i>Pretending to believe</i>
<i>there's a standard fee</i>

20:27.126 --> 20:28.493
<i>for what you're asking for</i>

20:28.560 --> 20:31.162
<i>means you're less likely</i>
<i>to report the bribe.</i>

20:31.230 --> 20:33.030
My cousin told me
how much the fee was.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.599
I about fell
on the frickin' floor.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.767
Well,
that's not actually --

20:35.834 --> 20:36.968
damn shades
aren't worth 4 bucks.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.803
Now I got to pay the city
of Miami $300?

20:38.871 --> 20:40.271
Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's --

20:40.339 --> 20:42.273
That is fair.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.642
<i>And if you come across</i>
<i>as unlikable,</i>

20:44.710 --> 20:48.079
<i>even a normally ethical person</i>
<i>might not pass up the chance</i>

20:48.147 --> 20:49.914
<i>to make a buck</i>
<i>off your stupidity.</i>

20:49.982 --> 20:52.049
Here you go.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.652
What can I say?
Tough break.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.021
Help yourself.

21:01.059 --> 21:02.560
Oof.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.862
Why didn't this guy <i>demand</i>
<i>they take another picture?</i>

21:07.199 --> 21:09.167
University of Miami
parking slip.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.935
Day after the Barrett deal.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.004
Maybe he took it
to the university

21:13.071 --> 21:15.072
to have an expert
try to decode it.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.108
You folks find the glasses
or what?

21:18.644 --> 21:19.877
Here they are!

21:19.945 --> 21:21.946
Wow. Wow.
Under the seat.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.048
What the hell were you doing,
they got under the seat?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.984
Oh, he's so jealous.
Who can live with it?

21:27.052 --> 21:28.386
Unbelievable!

21:34.293 --> 21:36.594
I thought I told you
not to come back here.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.162
I'm going into business
like you.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.597
I want to help you
with your cause.

21:39.665 --> 21:40.998
I don't need an acolyte.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.601
Two minutes.
Just two minutes.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.670
Just give me some tips,

21:45.737 --> 21:49.540
and you can have half
this mercury fulminate I have.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.409
It's like 80 pounds.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.244
You have 10 gallons
of mercury fulminate?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.079
Yeah, I read online
how to build bombs.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.881
It's a little sketchy

21:56.949 --> 21:59.050
on how to ignite
the detonating chemical.

21:59.117 --> 22:01.052
You need a friction trigger.
What?

22:01.119 --> 22:02.687
A friction trigger.

22:02.754 --> 22:04.288
I don't even --

22:04.356 --> 22:06.657
see?

22:06.725 --> 22:08.259
You're a genius.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.729
Just help me,
and you can have the stuff.

22:12.798 --> 22:15.666
2,000 bucks' worth of contraband
for a little show-and-tell?

22:15.734 --> 22:17.768
I want to learn
from the best.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.707
Suppose
that's understandable.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.312
Looks like you're outfitting
yourself for a lot of work.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.781
Well, you said
after the trial,

22:30.849 --> 22:33.317
"this city
needs a bath of fire."

22:33.385 --> 22:35.086
May I ask you something?

22:35.153 --> 22:37.021
Why do you do
what you do?

22:41.260 --> 22:44.729
It's in the genes, Gordon.

22:44.796 --> 22:47.298
It's a gift.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.699
Vision.

22:48.767 --> 22:52.436
When I see scum,
I <i>have</i> to end them.

22:52.504 --> 22:55.306
I know the feeling.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.708
Take the other day.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.610
South Beach.

22:59.678 --> 23:04.348
I get a tip that a drug dealer,
a gang leader,

23:04.416 --> 23:06.317
is gonna be
at a family restaurant.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.185
Well, who am I
if I don't end him?

23:08.253 --> 23:12.790
How do you feel about the people
who... get in the way?

23:12.858 --> 23:14.559
The couple who died.

23:16.194 --> 23:18.362
Casualties of war.

23:18.430 --> 23:21.465
It wasn't exactly
what I intended,

23:21.533 --> 23:23.935
but radio detonators
can be touchy.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.704
Certain electronic devices
get too close,

23:26.772 --> 23:29.640
and boom.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.343
<i>Que será.</i>

23:32.411 --> 23:34.078
Now, excuse me
while I test this.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.114
My doctor is calling.
He always bothers me.

23:37.182 --> 23:38.015
What?!

23:38.083 --> 23:40.518
Dr. Finley, I'm fine!

23:40.586 --> 23:42.720
Mike, he built five
of these things.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.855
I found it wadded up
in the trash.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.058
Yeah.
Not careful, this guy.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.594
And every one of these monsters
is marked "delivered."

23:49.661 --> 23:51.929
I got dates and times
but no locations.

23:51.997 --> 23:53.864
And the next one that's
scheduled is for later today,

23:53.932 --> 23:55.032
but God knows where.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.834
Forget your dates and times.

23:56.902 --> 24:00.071
It sounds like he's using some
pretty iffy radio detonators.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.173
They could all blow at any time.
This is a nightmare.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.008
We got to get answers
out of this guy right now.

24:04.076 --> 24:05.977
You read the transcripts.

24:06.044 --> 24:08.212
The cops grilled him
12 separate times.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.214
He doesn't talk.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.016
Yeah, I know,
and if we grab him and fail,

24:12.084 --> 24:13.951
we're signing a lot
of death warrants.

24:14.019 --> 24:15.186
Look,
it's your call, Mike.

24:15.253 --> 24:16.520
Take the plans
and get out, Sam.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.769
Where...Did you
buy this stuff?

24:31.837 --> 24:32.937
Chemical-supply company.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.205
The guy said
he'd give me a break --

24:36.174 --> 24:38.542
if it was <i>real,</i>

24:38.610 --> 24:41.112
you wouldn't have
a foot anymore...

24:41.179 --> 24:42.780
I'm sorry!
...You idiot!

24:42.848 --> 24:43.781
Sorry.

24:43.849 --> 24:45.316
I-I didn't know.

24:45.384 --> 24:49.220
Stop wasting my time.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.656
Get out of here!

24:59.364 --> 25:01.666
Hey, boss.
Mr. Westen is here.

25:01.733 --> 25:03.300
I said
I don't want to talk to him.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.637
Too bad.

25:06.705 --> 25:07.772
We're gonna talk.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.107
I had a chat
with Dennis Barfield.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.543
Who?

25:12.611 --> 25:13.778
Your partner.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.547
He isn't quite the genius
he thinks he is.

25:16.615 --> 25:19.183
It's time to end this.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.890
Illegally obtained evidence
can't be admitted --

25:25.957 --> 25:28.459
Do you see a judge here?!
A jury?!

25:30.962 --> 25:33.497
10 pounds of wood screws --

25:33.565 --> 25:37.401
ripped apart a veterinarian
and her fiancé.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.637
They're dead!

25:42.074 --> 25:43.307
Now, you're gonna
call him off,

25:43.375 --> 25:45.042
and you're gonna tell me
where the other bombs are.

25:48.013 --> 25:50.014
Admitting nothing,

25:50.082 --> 25:52.083
I had no control over
what a disturbed individual

25:52.150 --> 25:54.051
may or may not have done
in my name.

25:54.119 --> 25:56.020
Spit it out!
Spit it out!

25:59.291 --> 26:02.993
Start with, uh,
Walt Rensin.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.162
Dennis said he's next.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.965
324 North Oakhurst
in Hallandale.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.800
Get there before 5:00.

26:09.868 --> 26:12.203
After it's over,

26:12.270 --> 26:15.239
don't even think you're getting
out of this without confessing.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.508
Why would anyone
ever confess to anything

26:17.576 --> 26:19.210
when there's
a fifth amendment?

26:19.277 --> 26:21.746
I'll trade what I know,

26:21.813 --> 26:23.514
and I'll have a pledge of
immunity by the end of the day.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.482
Not from me you won't.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.922
Walt Rensin. What --

26:31.990 --> 26:34.825
isn't he the brother of that
poor girl from the hospital?

26:34.893 --> 26:36.227
Alicia, yeah.

26:36.294 --> 26:38.529
Her brother Walt was Lawson's
second in command.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.631
I guess since Dennis
missed him at the restaurant,

26:40.699 --> 26:41.799
he's trying him here.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.300
It's gonna be
a tall order.

26:43.368 --> 26:44.969
Looks like Lawson's crew
is on lock-down

26:45.036 --> 26:46.570
since the boss was killed.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.973
Scott seemed pretty confident
the bomb was already in place.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.808
We got to get in there.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.944
Yes, Scott.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.546
Is this Michael Westen?

26:55.614 --> 26:58.249
This is Dennis Barfield.
We haven't met.

26:58.316 --> 27:01.218
No, Dennis,
we haven't met.

27:01.286 --> 27:05.189
Why would you and this partner
of yours, Ms. Glenanne,

27:05.257 --> 27:07.491
get in the middle
of my plans?

27:07.559 --> 27:09.126
It's such a mistake.

27:09.194 --> 27:11.195
I don't know
what Scott told you, but --

27:11.263 --> 27:14.532
he said that
he had a change of heart.

27:14.599 --> 27:18.369
He said the scum
who kidnapped his daughter

27:18.436 --> 27:20.070
should get a pass.

27:20.138 --> 27:22.540
As if it was up to him.

27:22.607 --> 27:23.774
Dennis --

27:23.842 --> 27:25.976
it is <i>not</i> up to him!

27:26.044 --> 27:27.111
<i>I</i> decide.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.547
Arrangements
have been made.

27:31.216 --> 27:35.719
Once dominos start falling,
they have to <i>keep</i> falling.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.121
It is what they do.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.423
And they will
knock down <i>anything</i>

27:39.491 --> 27:41.058
that gets in their way.

27:41.126 --> 27:43.227
He's dead.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.595
You want to guess
who's next?

27:47.731 --> 27:48.851
Scott's dead?

27:49.414 --> 27:50.448
<i>Mike, hold up.</i>

27:50.516 --> 27:51.782
We have no way
to find Dennis,

27:51.850 --> 27:53.718
and Walt and Alicia
are gonna be dead, too,

27:53.785 --> 27:55.920
if we don't find
that bomb before he sets it off.

27:55.988 --> 27:57.522
I'm not leaving.
I'm arming myself.

27:57.589 --> 27:59.023
Walt's guards --
they know our faces.

27:59.091 --> 28:00.725
They're not gonna listen
to a couple of guys

28:00.792 --> 28:02.293
who screwed them over
last week.

28:02.361 --> 28:03.427
Yeah, okay.

28:03.495 --> 28:05.196
Mike, look,
you are in no shape

28:05.264 --> 28:06.998
to take these guys on
hand-to-hand, even with a blade.

28:07.065 --> 28:08.432
I know that.

28:08.500 --> 28:09.934
I'm just gonna make sure
they don't see our faces.

28:12.237 --> 28:14.772
I'm not sure I'm following you
there, Mikey.

28:16.875 --> 28:20.344
Hold this,
will you, Sam?

28:20.412 --> 28:22.180
<i>Despite the expression,</i>

28:22.247 --> 28:25.283
<i>very few people</i>
<i>actually shoot the messenger.</i>

28:25.350 --> 28:26.951
<i>Making a fake delivery</i>

28:27.019 --> 28:30.054
<i>is a great way to get close</i>
<i>to a well-defended position.</i>

28:30.122 --> 28:32.056
<i>Carry a large enough bouquet,</i>

28:32.124 --> 28:35.092
<i>and you can get very close</i>
<i>without being I.D.'d.</i>

28:35.160 --> 28:36.661
Is this
Dale Lawson's house?

28:36.728 --> 28:38.229
He's dead.

28:38.297 --> 28:40.198
Don't you know you guys are
delivering a funeral bouquet?

28:40.265 --> 28:43.267
My mistake.

28:43.335 --> 28:45.203
It's the dude
from last week.

28:45.270 --> 28:47.071
Hey, pick those up!
I put a lot of time into that!

28:48.340 --> 28:50.608
Why don't we go inside
and put these in water?

28:52.110 --> 28:54.645
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

28:54.713 --> 28:55.947
Mm-hmm.
We get that a lot.

28:56.014 --> 28:57.815
Alicia,
we met at the hospital.

28:57.883 --> 28:59.550
What are you doing here?
There's a bomb in the house.

28:59.618 --> 29:00.818
It had to have been put here
after your boss was killed.

29:00.886 --> 29:02.186
Where would --

29:02.254 --> 29:04.689
that's impossible.
We've been out front ever since.

29:04.756 --> 29:06.157
When did you get
that flat screen?

29:07.993 --> 29:10.061
It got delivered
yesterday.

29:10.128 --> 29:11.495
The guy said
Dale ordered it.

29:11.563 --> 29:14.065
Yeah,
I don't think he did.

29:19.871 --> 29:22.607
Whoa. Must be
one of those 3-D sets.

29:22.674 --> 29:24.875
No wonder Dennis is having
problems with early detonation.

29:24.943 --> 29:27.745
That radio
looks like a carnival prize.

29:27.813 --> 29:30.114
Alicia? Where the hell
are Frank and Eddy?

29:33.585 --> 29:34.986
You!

29:35.053 --> 29:36.120
Put the gun down, Walt.

29:36.188 --> 29:37.355
Alicia,
get out of my way!

29:37.422 --> 29:38.689
Put the gun down!

29:38.757 --> 29:40.157
He can't hear you.

29:40.225 --> 29:41.993
Ever since the bombing,
he's legally deaf.

29:42.060 --> 29:47.164
Look, we are only here so that
that doesn't go ba-boom!

29:47.232 --> 29:49.166
What the hell
is he talking about?

29:49.234 --> 29:51.969
It's a bomb!

29:52.037 --> 29:54.272
Please. Look at me.

29:54.339 --> 29:55.773
Bomb?

29:56.908 --> 29:58.409
Can you defuse it?

29:58.477 --> 30:01.746
Maybe. Maybe not.

30:03.548 --> 30:04.482
You guys
have any duct tape?

30:05.784 --> 30:07.385
His name
is Mark Sweeney.

30:07.452 --> 30:09.854
We just need to ask him
a few questions.

30:09.921 --> 30:12.089
He may have had
an encrypted bible with him.

30:12.157 --> 30:13.924
Who'd you say
you were again?

30:13.992 --> 30:16.761
Artest. This is my partner,
Shannon Brown.

30:16.828 --> 30:18.629
Are you sure? This --
this would've been,

30:18.697 --> 30:20.564
what, like a couple,
few days ago.

30:20.632 --> 30:22.333
Hey, cutie,
you you seen this guy?

30:22.401 --> 30:25.036
Ohh, finally. Progress.

30:26.204 --> 30:27.905
I'll be right here.

30:27.973 --> 30:29.173
Yeah.

30:29.241 --> 30:31.742
<i>Foot chases</i>
<i>rarely last long.</i>

30:31.810 --> 30:33.611
<i>During the initial</i>
<i>burst of adrenaline,</i>

30:33.679 --> 30:35.646
<i>it's important</i>
<i>to keep your target in view.</i>

30:35.714 --> 30:37.715
<i>If you can,</i>
<i>you'll probably catch up.</i>

30:37.783 --> 30:39.917
<i>Few people have anything left</i>
<i>in the tank</i>

30:39.985 --> 30:41.952
<i>after a quarter mile</i>
<i>at top speed.</i>

30:42.020 --> 30:43.521
Come on, man!
I just want to talk!

30:46.892 --> 30:47.825
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

30:47.893 --> 30:48.759
Come on!
Come on, man.

30:48.827 --> 30:50.094
Just stop running.

30:50.162 --> 30:51.796
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't -- I can't --

30:51.863 --> 30:53.264
I can't go to jail.

30:53.332 --> 30:55.199
I'm -- I'm --
I'm very thin.

30:58.036 --> 30:59.236
Where'd you see Sweeney?

30:59.304 --> 31:01.272
He came
around three days ago.

31:01.340 --> 31:03.507
He wanted me
to decode some files,

31:03.575 --> 31:05.076
government-looking files.

31:05.143 --> 31:06.110
Did you help him?

31:06.178 --> 31:07.445
It was over my head.

31:07.512 --> 31:10.948
I told him to go see
this dude over at SXG --

31:11.016 --> 31:13.484
a defense contractor
I interned for.

31:13.552 --> 31:15.986
He gave me 100 bucks
for his name.

31:16.054 --> 31:16.821
That's all.

31:19.157 --> 31:20.624
Okay.

31:20.692 --> 31:23.527
Looks like we're off to talk
to a guy named Justin Walsh.

31:23.595 --> 31:26.464
He's algorithmic engineer
down at SXG.

31:26.531 --> 31:28.799
Ichabod Bolt back there
recommended him

31:28.867 --> 31:30.501
to decode
Barrett's files.

31:30.569 --> 31:32.503
Impressive work,
Detective Artest.

31:36.808 --> 31:37.975
Michael, what's new?

31:38.043 --> 31:39.744
A serial killer
wants me dead.

31:39.811 --> 31:41.245
I guess
that's kind of fresh.

31:41.313 --> 31:44.081
So, uh, Dennis knows
about Mike, Fi,

31:44.149 --> 31:45.316
and if he has
half a brain,

31:45.384 --> 31:46.717
he's not gonna go back
to his condo again.

31:46.785 --> 31:49.120
So we got one shot
to triangulate his position.

31:49.187 --> 31:50.621
From what?

31:50.689 --> 31:52.456
Well, we're gonna kinda let him
blow up another bomb.

31:52.524 --> 31:55.426
How fast can you get home
and find your laptop

31:55.494 --> 31:56.394
and digital radio?

31:56.461 --> 31:57.795
Are you serious?

31:57.863 --> 31:59.830
We're spreading out
and dialing in Dennis' location

31:59.898 --> 32:01.232
from his trigger signal?

32:01.299 --> 32:06.470
Yep. You, me,
and, I don't know, my mom?

32:06.538 --> 32:10.007
Jesse will do it.
I'll call you.

32:10.075 --> 32:11.642
No, he won't.

32:11.710 --> 32:13.344
I don't know what
you just volunteered me for.

32:13.412 --> 32:15.446
I'm not getting mixed up in
anything Michael's got going on.

32:15.514 --> 32:18.249
Jesse, we lied
about what we did to you.

32:18.316 --> 32:20.151
We didn't lie
about who we are.

32:20.218 --> 32:21.385
We're tracking that guy

32:21.453 --> 32:23.287
who blew up the restaurant
in South Beach.

32:24.389 --> 32:27.224
Son of a bitch.

32:27.292 --> 32:28.559
Channel 6, Sam.

32:28.627 --> 32:32.029
Alicia, step away
from the window, just in case.

32:32.097 --> 32:33.998
It's 5:00. Now what?

32:37.903 --> 32:40.304
Walt, phone!

32:43.575 --> 32:44.475
Hello?

32:44.543 --> 32:45.709
Hello.

32:45.777 --> 32:48.279
This is the man
that killed your boss.

32:50.949 --> 32:52.049
What do you want?

32:52.117 --> 32:53.250
Turn on the news.

32:53.318 --> 32:55.186
There's something
I want you to see.

32:57.856 --> 32:59.757
I did it.
What channel?

32:59.825 --> 33:01.392
Okay, I did it.
What channel?

33:06.631 --> 33:08.866
<i>Triangulating</i>
<i>someone's position</i>

33:08.934 --> 33:11.202
<i>from a radio or cellular signal</i>

33:11.269 --> 33:13.170
<i>works exactly</i>
<i>the way it sounds --</i>

33:13.238 --> 33:15.406
<i>by recording the time</i>
<i>and intensity of the signal</i>

33:15.474 --> 33:16.974
<i>from three separate positions,</i>

33:17.042 --> 33:19.877
<i>it's fairly easy to calculate</i>
<i>the position of origin.</i>

33:19.945 --> 33:22.913
<i>And a computer program</i>
<i>can do the work a lot faster</i>

33:22.981 --> 33:24.782
<i>if your trigonometry</i>
<i>is rusty.</i>

33:24.850 --> 33:27.051
Michael,
are you seeing this?

33:27.118 --> 33:28.819
Dennis
is in <i>my</i> neighborhood.

33:28.887 --> 33:30.154
He's on your block, Fi.

33:30.222 --> 33:31.722
Scott told him
about both of us.

33:31.790 --> 33:34.625
He's coming after you.

33:35.894 --> 33:37.495
No, Fi,
we need him alive.

33:37.562 --> 33:38.929
Damn it, Michael.

33:38.997 --> 33:41.265
I am not letting
some psycho

33:41.333 --> 33:44.034
be the first person to bring
explosives into my new place.

33:44.102 --> 33:45.536
Just get out of there.

33:45.604 --> 33:47.204
Get out of there, Fi!

33:47.272 --> 33:48.973
Get out of there!

33:58.610 --> 34:00.044
Jesse.
Good to see you, man.

34:00.111 --> 34:02.179
You really want
to have a reunion right now?

34:02.247 --> 34:04.315
Seriously?
Okay, maybe not.

34:04.382 --> 34:05.783
Here's what we know --

34:05.850 --> 34:07.785
Dennis has at least four bombs
scattered around town.

34:07.852 --> 34:09.320
What we don't know
is where.

34:09.387 --> 34:11.355
And these things are wired
to the shakiest radio detonators

34:11.422 --> 34:12.889
I've ever seen.

34:12.956 --> 34:14.257
Even if he doesn't
trigger them,

34:14.326 --> 34:15.793
the damn things
are gonna go off eventually.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.928
I think I should go in alone.
Excuse me?

34:17.996 --> 34:19.630
Give me a minute,
surround the house,

34:19.697 --> 34:21.831
shoot out the windows --
make us feel the heat.

34:21.900 --> 34:24.501
He and I are in there alone, in
a foxhole, I'm his only friend.

34:24.569 --> 34:27.338
Okay, well, what the hell
is this, then?

34:28.706 --> 34:31.408
Looks like
they're sealing off the area.

34:31.476 --> 34:32.810
A neighbor must have seen
Dennis breaking in

34:32.877 --> 34:34.043
and called the police.

34:34.112 --> 34:35.746
Michael!

34:35.813 --> 34:38.114
Dennis is insane.

34:38.183 --> 34:39.949
You can't get on his wavelength.
Not this guy.

34:40.018 --> 34:41.518
Fi, we got to do something.

34:41.585 --> 34:42.886
Even if the cops
catch Dennis,

34:42.954 --> 34:44.521
he's never gonna tell them
where the bombs are.

34:44.589 --> 34:46.422
You get caught in the middle
of another police standoff --

34:46.491 --> 34:47.524
it's okay.

34:56.134 --> 34:57.401
Dennis!

34:59.304 --> 35:03.073
Dennis, it's me -- Gordon.

35:03.141 --> 35:06.944
How...In God's name

35:07.011 --> 35:09.380
did you find me?

35:09.447 --> 35:11.014
Police are coming.

35:11.082 --> 35:13.016
The police are coming,
and we have to get out of here.

35:13.084 --> 35:14.385
Where the hell
did you come from?

35:14.452 --> 35:15.753
I was following you.

35:15.820 --> 35:18.088
I wanted to see
how you do what you do.

35:18.156 --> 35:19.390
But -- I'm sorry,

35:19.457 --> 35:21.492
but there was a jogger,
and she saw you break in,

35:21.559 --> 35:23.026
and she called the police.

35:23.094 --> 35:24.228
That's unfortunate,
but --

35:24.295 --> 35:26.797
Don't worry.
I took care of her, like you do.

35:26.865 --> 35:27.865
I ended her.

35:29.401 --> 35:31.068
I'm like you now.

35:31.136 --> 35:33.570
Oh, you idiot!

35:33.638 --> 35:36.473
Do you have any idea
how much heat

35:36.541 --> 35:38.442
you have just
brought down on me?!

35:41.179 --> 35:42.579
This is no good.

35:42.647 --> 35:43.847
One burst of static
on the wrong channel...

35:43.915 --> 35:45.215
Yeah, well,
maybe Dennis hasn't armed

35:45.283 --> 35:46.683
the housewarming gift
he brought for you.

35:46.751 --> 35:48.318
I watched a man
go in there with a bomb.

35:48.386 --> 35:49.753
You stay off your radio.

35:49.821 --> 35:51.155
Guys, guys, I'm a neighbor.
I saw the whole thing.

35:51.222 --> 35:52.322
He's got a bomb!

35:52.390 --> 35:54.758
He's got a bomb.
I saw him go in there.

35:54.826 --> 35:56.827
You think
these idiots realize

35:56.895 --> 35:59.163
how much water
I carried for them,

35:59.230 --> 36:02.599
scraping all the filth
off this planet?

36:02.667 --> 36:05.702
I guess no good deed
goes unpunished.

36:05.770 --> 36:09.039
<i>More than anything,</i>
<i>zealots crave an audience.</i>

36:09.107 --> 36:10.607
<i>Fanatics, at their core,</i>

36:10.675 --> 36:13.010
<i>believe they have something</i>
<i>to teach the world.</i>

36:13.077 --> 36:14.778
<i>Dealing with a fanatic, then,</i>

36:14.846 --> 36:17.514
<i>is often just a matter</i>
<i>of being a very good stunt.</i>

36:23.254 --> 36:26.190
Well, if they want
to take me out,

36:26.257 --> 36:28.659
then they're coming
with me.

36:28.726 --> 36:30.561
You can't end this.

36:30.628 --> 36:31.628
Not now.

36:31.696 --> 36:34.798
I'm not afraid to die.

36:34.866 --> 36:36.633
But your work --
you said there was more to come.

36:36.701 --> 36:40.137
There is <i>so</i> much more.

36:40.205 --> 36:43.540
Do you realize how many others
will rise up

36:43.608 --> 36:46.043
after I do
what I'm about to do?

36:46.110 --> 36:48.345
You're lucky, Gordon.

36:48.413 --> 36:51.548
You'll be remembered
as my first disciple,

36:51.616 --> 36:53.951
the first to recognize

36:54.018 --> 36:58.188
that the rancid,
festering parasites --

36:58.256 --> 37:00.123
you are a genius!

37:00.191 --> 37:01.725
Stop interrupting me!

37:01.793 --> 37:05.529
I mean, I get it.
I get it.

37:05.597 --> 37:07.631
I can walk out of here
like your hostage.

37:07.699 --> 37:09.266
The cops
won't even bother me.

37:09.334 --> 37:11.502
<i>I</i> can detonate the devices.

37:11.569 --> 37:14.471
Yes. Yeah!

37:14.539 --> 37:16.874
You could detonate them.
You could.

37:16.941 --> 37:19.009
I'm not as smart as you.

37:19.077 --> 37:20.611
I never will be,

37:20.678 --> 37:23.480
but I am similar to you
in so many ways.

37:23.548 --> 37:25.949
When I see the world,

37:26.017 --> 37:28.652
what's wrong with it,
twisted --

37:28.720 --> 37:30.687
there are demons among us.

37:30.755 --> 37:33.657
When I see something wrong,

37:33.725 --> 37:36.493
I have to act.

37:36.561 --> 37:38.962
I can't help myself.

37:39.030 --> 37:41.131
You tell me
where the bombs are...

37:45.637 --> 37:48.839
...And I will carry
your message to the world.

37:51.609 --> 37:54.144
They'll search you.

37:57.315 --> 37:59.616
You have to memorize
the addresses.

38:04.355 --> 38:06.256
Put your hands
behind your head!

38:08.293 --> 38:09.526
Put your hands
behind your head now!

38:09.594 --> 38:13.030
Put 'em behind your head!

38:13.097 --> 38:15.699
Get down on the ground!
Get down now!

38:22.674 --> 38:24.174
He's got the locations.

38:24.242 --> 38:25.375
Our boy is back.

38:28.279 --> 38:29.813
This isn't exactly over,
Sam.

38:29.881 --> 38:32.182
You said it yourself.

38:32.250 --> 38:34.084
These cops don't know
what they're up against.

38:34.152 --> 38:35.352
What if they breach

38:35.420 --> 38:36.987
and Dennis decides to end it
when they get close?

38:37.055 --> 38:39.089
Someone could die.

38:39.157 --> 38:40.457
Fi, how do you
want to play it?

38:59.277 --> 39:00.377
Jesse, you just...

39:00.445 --> 39:01.545
Yeah.

39:03.982 --> 39:07.751
Sometimes you got to
put the rabid dog down.

39:33.948 --> 39:36.450
You look worse than you did when
you got out of the hospital.

39:36.517 --> 39:38.619
Yeah, well,
I've had a long week.

39:38.686 --> 39:42.322
You never answered my question,
by the way,

39:42.390 --> 39:47.294
about why you do
what you do.

39:47.362 --> 39:49.096
Do you even
think about it?

39:49.163 --> 39:52.866
Since the day I was burned,
every day.

39:52.934 --> 39:54.701
And?

39:57.538 --> 40:00.240
And I don't know.

40:00.308 --> 40:02.843
I don't know if my reasons are
that different from anybody else

40:02.911 --> 40:07.180
who likes the feel of a trigger
on their finger.

40:07.248 --> 40:10.651
I wish I understood.
I just d't.

40:14.522 --> 40:15.856
Whatever.

40:15.924 --> 40:17.557
"Whatever"?

40:17.625 --> 40:18.825
Yeah.

40:18.893 --> 40:20.794
I mean, maybe you've got
some repressed crap,

40:20.862 --> 40:23.964
you know -- rage...

40:24.032 --> 40:26.266
About how it was for you
when you were a kid,

40:26.334 --> 40:28.735
or the things you've seen,

40:28.803 --> 40:30.871
or -- I don't know.

40:30.939 --> 40:34.207
Maybe this is just
how you fit into the world.

40:34.275 --> 40:35.142
Whatever.

40:36.778 --> 40:38.178
Thanks, mom.

40:38.246 --> 40:40.347
What I'm saying is, in the end,
it doesn't matter.

40:43.051 --> 40:46.086
You're one of the good guys,
Michael.

40:46.154 --> 40:47.688
I'm proud of you.

40:47.755 --> 40:50.557
I bought you a present.

41:06.074 --> 41:08.675
These are <i>exactly</i>
<i>like the pair I lost.</i>

41:08.743 --> 41:10.344
How -- how did you...

41:10.411 --> 41:12.112
It's called shopping.

41:12.180 --> 41:13.280
We all
have our strengths.

41:14.749 --> 41:16.283
Now go do what you do.

41:26.561 --> 41:28.095
Thanks for meeting me.

41:29.731 --> 41:32.132
And for the other day,
with Dennis.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.800
And for saving my life.

41:33.868 --> 41:35.502
Let's just do this.

41:35.570 --> 41:37.371
So, what do we know
about this crypto specialist

41:37.438 --> 41:38.572
Sweeney went to see?

41:38.639 --> 41:39.806
Justin Walsh.

41:39.874 --> 41:41.208
A buddy of Sam's says

41:41.275 --> 41:43.510
the guy's national security
clearance for over a decade.

41:43.578 --> 41:46.680
He's, uh, apparently fond
of wrought iron.

41:46.748 --> 41:48.048
And now you're
all caught up.

41:48.116 --> 41:49.783
There are clearances
and then there are <i>clearances.</i>

41:49.851 --> 41:51.651
I wonder if Walsh would even
know what he was looking at

41:51.719 --> 41:53.653
if he decoded it.

41:56.858 --> 41:57.991
I think he knew.

42:01.362 --> 42:02.696
No briefcase,
no NOC list.

42:02.764 --> 42:04.531
No trace
of where Justin Walsh went

42:04.599 --> 42:06.133
after he killed Sweeney
for it.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.768
I did find
Walsh's e-mail address.

42:07.835 --> 42:09.836
I know it's not much
to go on.

42:09.904 --> 42:12.472
Whoever this guy is,
he's got the name and position

42:12.540 --> 42:14.674
of every one
of the people who burned me,

42:14.742 --> 42:17.577
he knows how dangerous and
valuable that information is,

42:17.645 --> 42:19.160
and he has
a three-day head start.
