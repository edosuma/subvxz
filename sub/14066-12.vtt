00:00.050 --> 00:01.589
<i>Previously on “Boston Legal”…</i>

00:01.630 --> 00:03.580
I present you Mr and Mrs Ivan Tiggs.

00:03.620 --> 00:05.020
I think Ivan is cheating.

00:05.060 --> 00:07.340
Cheating… on you, his wife?

00:07.350 --> 00:11.360
The important part is that you did the
brave, honorable, honest thing by telling me.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.990
And I still want you to represent me.

00:13.030 --> 00:14.660
My name is Leigh Swift.

00:14.670 --> 00:16.350
–This box…
–Is my lover.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.590
Would you like to get a drink with me?

00:18.630 --> 00:21.290
If you don't want to date me
anymore, please just be honest with me.

00:21.330 --> 00:24.010
I'm quite sympathetic to the
condition of objectophilia,

00:24.050 --> 00:28.180
but if your girlfriend cheats on you with
a clock radio and runs off with an iPhone,

00:28.220 --> 00:31.322
she's bonkers, and you'd
best be done with her.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.310
Hello!

00:44.160 --> 00:45.110
Missy.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.910
Bet you're surprised to see me.

00:48.980 --> 00:49.930
Well…

00:49.940 --> 00:54.850
I'm here under the most wonderful
and tragic of circumstances.

00:57.430 --> 00:58.390
So…

00:58.400 --> 01:00.710
First the good news—
I've been in therapy…

01:00.750 --> 01:03.870
after Ivan crushed me like a bug!

01:03.880 --> 01:05.590
Therapy's going well, I see.

01:05.630 --> 01:06.790
Oh, it is.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.380
Very innovative.

01:08.390 --> 01:10.960
Created by two geniuses at Emerson.

01:10.970 --> 01:11.970
Maybe you've heard of it.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.340
It's called “life is a song.”

01:14.350 --> 01:17.690
Basically they teach you to look
at the world as one big musical.

01:17.730 --> 01:19.380
I'm thriving under it.

01:19.390 --> 01:21.990
No matter how low things could get…

01:23.500 --> 01:25.650
♫ Xanadu ♫

01:26.720 --> 01:28.190
I get the idea.

01:28.850 --> 01:31.630
Anyway, I met someone.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.730
And get this— he's a
beautiful african man.

01:36.050 --> 01:37.900
And he speaks perfect english.

01:37.940 --> 01:39.540
He was born and raised
in the States.

01:39.580 --> 01:42.160
His great-grandparents
moved here years ago.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.480
So he's african-american then.

01:44.490 --> 01:45.900
Exactly.

01:45.910 --> 01:47.270
And it gets even better.

01:47.310 --> 01:49.220
It couldn't possibly.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.690
We're pregnant.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.720
I'm having an african-american baby.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.600
♫ Having his baby ♫

01:57.930 --> 02:01.210
What's the tragic part,
beside the music?

02:01.220 --> 02:02.150
Oh, yes.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.360
Well, he doesn't want to have it.

02:04.370 --> 02:06.190
Claims he never meant
to get me pregnant.

02:06.230 --> 02:07.620
Haven't we all heard that?

02:07.660 --> 02:08.560
Well, did he?

02:08.570 --> 02:10.000
Actually, no.

02:10.570 --> 02:12.790
We only went out twice, actually,

02:12.800 --> 02:17.110
but because I want to have a family and
there's that biological clock to worry about,

02:17.150 --> 02:22.220
I made a teeny-weeny little deposit
of his seed thingy in the sperm bank.

02:22.230 --> 02:24.450
Well, why did he give
you his sperm if—

02:24.490 --> 02:26.690
Well, he didn't exactly give it to me.

02:26.730 --> 02:30.170
I played a little unzippedy-do
with his fly thingy,

02:30.180 --> 02:34.430
and I “persuaded him”
with “oral arguments.”

02:34.440 --> 02:39.140
Then I put his african-american seed
in a test tube, and I fertilized my egg.

02:39.180 --> 02:42.030
That's how you got Mr Sperm?

02:42.700 --> 02:45.970
And now he says he's going to sue me.

02:47.090 --> 02:48.780
Can you imagine?

02:48.790 --> 02:53.610
Set out my little honey trap, now
I'm having an african-american baby

Boston Legal Season04 Episode12
Roe vs Wade: The Musical

03:30.820 --> 03:32.410
Hello, Jerry.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.410
Leigh.

03:36.010 --> 03:37.740
Hello, Leigh.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.430
Jerry…

03:41.890 --> 03:44.800
I know we parted
in an awkward way,

03:44.810 --> 03:49.280
for which I'm ashamed, but
I'm not here about that.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.520
I'm afraid I need a lawyer.

03:51.560 --> 03:54.540
I've been fired from my
long-standing teaching position.

03:54.580 --> 03:57.360
What'd you do,
give tongue to a locker?

03:57.370 --> 03:58.180
That was mean.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.890
Dumping me for a smartphone
was mean.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.320
Why did they discharge you?

04:05.330 --> 04:07.620
Because I hugged a student.

04:07.630 --> 04:08.860
Not sexually.

04:08.870 --> 04:10.420
–Not like I would a—
–Α clock radio.

04:10.460 --> 04:11.750
–Mean!
–Meaner!

04:12.340 --> 04:13.770
You hugged a student?

04:13.780 --> 04:15.590
A student in distress.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.010
I went to comfort her.

04:17.050 --> 04:19.600
My school has a
policy— no hugging.

04:19.610 --> 04:20.980
This child needed a hug.

04:21.019 --> 04:23.020
I gave it to her.

04:23.590 --> 04:24.780
I want to sue them.

04:24.820 --> 04:28.530
This political correctness
crap has gone too far.

04:29.290 --> 04:31.410
Could you help me?

04:45.170 --> 04:47.720
Missy Tiggs is having your child?

04:48.030 --> 04:50.840
Look, the woman practically raped me.

04:50.850 --> 04:51.890
You know what I'm saying?

04:51.930 --> 04:53.070
I can't be with her.

04:53.110 --> 04:56.440
Well, Mr Maxwell, you
don't have to be with her.

04:56.450 --> 04:58.410
But that's the thing, man.

04:58.420 --> 05:00.390
That's the thing.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.940
Yes.

05:03.910 --> 05:06.340
Would you mind telling me the thing?

05:06.350 --> 05:08.370
Look, I got causes in my life.

05:08.380 --> 05:09.330
You know what I'm saying?

05:09.370 --> 05:10.630
Pediatric AIDS.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.090
I give some to your
women with breast cancer.

05:13.130 --> 05:14.840
I'm a public-minded brother.

05:14.880 --> 05:19.610
My biggest cause, my
thing, is daddy-go-bye-bye.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.790
Absentee
black fathers—

05:21.800 --> 05:25.760
it's a problem in the culture, in the
country, and it's my biggest thing.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.810
So I got two
choices here—

05:27.820 --> 05:32.400
be an absentee father
or live with Missy Tiggs.

05:32.410 --> 05:34.670
Well, I'm afraid those
are your only two choices.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.580
Well, I want to stop it.

05:36.850 --> 05:38.990
–Stop it?
–Yeah, it.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.090
I want you to help me stop it.

05:43.650 --> 05:47.410
And again, for clarification,
“it” is?

05:47.420 --> 05:49.030
Her having my baby.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.260
Oh, well, I'm afraid you can't do that.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.540
Why not?

05:51.790 --> 05:53.410
–Well—
–You can do it.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.560
I heard about you.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.980
No, I know they hired Shirley Schmidt.

05:57.020 --> 06:00.910
And I know you represented that
Ivan Dude against them before.

06:00.950 --> 06:03.480
You need to help me…

06:03.490 --> 06:05.310
stop it.

06:11.420 --> 06:14.280
First of all, I should
say I'm not a hugger.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.380
I find it very difficult to hug, in fact.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.530
Why is that?

06:18.540 --> 06:22.340
Well, I'm very uncomfortable
with my hands leaving my thighs—

06:22.380 --> 06:26.810
But on the day of January
9th, you hugged Bonnie Taylor.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.000
Yes.

06:28.010 --> 06:31.950
She had just done poorly on an
exam, and she was simply devastated.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.380
I was talking to her about it.

06:33.420 --> 06:36.740
She became inconsolable,
and I hugged her.

06:36.750 --> 06:40.830
You were aware your
school has a no-hug policy?

06:40.840 --> 06:43.210
Yes, but this student was in distress.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.680
She needed comfort.

06:44.690 --> 06:49.560
And I felt I had to prioritize her needs
over the school's policy in this instance.

06:49.600 --> 06:54.140
You also made that exception last November
when you hugged a different student.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.350
A boy, upset over social problems.

06:56.390 --> 06:59.430
And you were told by the
principal not to do it again?

06:59.470 --> 07:00.350
Yes.

07:00.360 --> 07:04.480
And you made yet another exception the second
week of December, hugging yet another student.

07:04.520 --> 07:10.450
Again you were told to stop, in fact warned that
the next time could be grounds for discharge.

07:10.490 --> 07:11.930
This policy is not right.

07:11.970 --> 07:12.730
I see.

07:12.740 --> 07:15.340
So you made a decision to defy it.

07:15.350 --> 07:16.340
It's unfair.

07:16.350 --> 07:17.990
Unfair?

07:18.250 --> 07:22.850
Has the school had a history of
treating you unfairly, Ms Swift?

07:24.820 --> 07:26.670
What is objectophilia?

07:26.680 --> 07:27.750
Objection. Irrelevant.

07:27.790 --> 07:29.230
This woman teaches our children.

07:29.270 --> 07:32.540
If she suffers from a sexual
disorder, it's certainly relevant,

07:32.580 --> 07:37.130
especially when she was discharged for
improper physical conduct with a student.

07:37.170 --> 07:41.658
It was not sexual in nature, and
for you to imply so is out of line.

07:42.860 --> 07:46.360
What is objectophilia,
Ms Swift?

07:48.880 --> 07:51.020
Please answer.

07:52.300 --> 07:56.730
It's a condition where one is
sexually attracted to objects.

08:07.110 --> 08:09.130
I'm very nervous that he's coming in.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.400
Maybe I should—

08:10.950 --> 08:12.590
He's very handsome, Shirley.

08:12.630 --> 08:15.240
Just looking at him can
make my genitalia flutter.

08:15.280 --> 08:16.340
Oh, please. Can I—

08:16.380 --> 08:17.260
No!

08:17.270 --> 08:18.760
It calms me, Shirley.

08:18.770 --> 08:20.230
Plus, he responds to it.

08:20.270 --> 08:22.790
Yeah, so do I. No singing.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.920
Okay.

08:23.930 --> 08:25.720
This here's…

08:26.000 --> 08:27.540
my lawyer.

08:28.230 --> 08:29.830
What's going on here?

08:29.840 --> 08:33.130
What's going on is your
client stole my client's semen.

08:33.169 --> 08:34.130
Oh, right.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.130
You gave it quite willingly, Mr Man.

08:36.169 --> 08:38.309
I didn't know what you
were gonna do with it, woman.

08:38.350 --> 08:41.350
Ahh, I love it when he calls me “woman.”

08:41.830 --> 08:44.650
What exactly are you asking for?

08:44.660 --> 08:46.650
An abortion.

08:49.870 --> 08:51.070
You are kidding.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.020
No. If I were kidding,
I'd stand like this.

08:54.830 --> 08:57.270
You— you have read a little
case called Roe vs Wade,

08:57.310 --> 08:58.580
which says a
woman's body—

08:58.620 --> 09:00.790
Read the case, saw the
movie, got me to thinking,

09:00.830 --> 09:03.890
wouldn't the current supreme
court just love an opportunity

09:03.930 --> 09:09.180
to overthrow Roe without being
vilified as antiabortion? Well…

09:09.560 --> 09:10.980
ta-da.

09:10.990 --> 09:11.860
What's this ta-da?

09:11.900 --> 09:15.510
Is that some legal thingy, like <i>res ispa</i> ?

09:15.520 --> 09:17.000
What's ta-da?

09:17.010 --> 09:20.880
Setting aside the absurd notion
that you might actually argue this—

09:20.920 --> 09:22.520
Yes, setting aside that.

09:22.530 --> 09:27.660
As a matter of law —today's law— once
the sperm, blood or tissue leaves the body,

09:27.700 --> 09:30.360
a person no longer has
any proprietary right.

09:30.400 --> 09:36.620
And also under today's law, you have no right
whatsoever to get a court-ordered abortion.

09:38.050 --> 09:40.000
Finish the sentence, Shirley. Go ahead.

09:40.040 --> 09:40.770
I did.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.270
No. From your tone,

09:42.280 --> 09:46.560
I could almost hear the tag,
“and I'd like to see you try.”

09:53.880 --> 09:56.140
I should think we'd just be
able to conflict Alan out.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.850
No. Missy already waived conflict
when we represented Ivan,

09:58.890 --> 10:02.430
and Terrence is waiving it
now because he wants Alan.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.520
What can he come with?

10:03.560 --> 10:07.330
Well, I think the strongest
argument would be public policy.

10:07.370 --> 10:10.880
The state doesn't want fraud to be used
to compel fatherhood against a man's will.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.350
Well, we've got bigger
public policy on our side.

10:13.390 --> 10:14.460
Ordering an abortion.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.440
Yes, but Roe vs Wade doesn't convey
a woman's right to have a baby.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.220
It's premised on her right
to control her body.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.570
Which would give her the right not to
have a medical procedure against her will.

10:22.610 --> 10:26.110
One would hope, but we wouldn't necessarily
be talking about a medical procedure here.

10:26.150 --> 10:27.840
Missy's only five weeks pregnant.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.520
She could take the
abortion pill, RU-486.

10:30.560 --> 10:34.916
Taking a pill would arguably not
constitute an invasive procedure.

10:35.070 --> 10:37.560
And how would we counter that?

10:37.570 --> 10:40.410
Well… vigorously?

10:43.870 --> 10:46.930
Personally, I hate
the no-hugging policy.

10:46.940 --> 10:49.500
But I dislike the
insurance premiums more.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.820
The fact is, some teachers
have crossed the line.

10:52.830 --> 10:56.080
And it could do irreparable
damage to the kid, the school.

10:56.120 --> 11:02.700
And the easiest way to safeguard against
inappropriate contact is just to say no contact.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.990
So just shut down all human
contact, is that the idea?

11:07.000 --> 11:07.640
No.

11:07.650 --> 11:12.910
The idea is to shut down post-traumatic
distress when teachers abuse their trust.

11:12.950 --> 11:15.780
The idea is to shut down lawsuits.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.550
It was my daughter she hugged.

11:17.590 --> 11:18.480
Did you object?

11:18.520 --> 11:19.610
Oh, God, no.

11:19.620 --> 11:20.780
Bonnie was despondent.

11:20.820 --> 11:23.770
Thank God there was a compassionate
teacher who was there for her.

11:23.810 --> 11:26.690
Believe me, we've got too
many of the other kind.

11:26.730 --> 11:30.780
Would you have been comfortable as a parent
for a teacher with a known sexual disorder

11:30.820 --> 11:33.730
to be physically touching your daughter?

11:33.740 --> 11:35.740
Probably not, but I know this teacher.

11:35.780 --> 11:41.120
Who should bear the burden of knowing all the
teachers and deciding whether hugging is okay or not,

11:41.160 --> 11:44.200
the parents or the— or
the principal, do you think?

11:44.240 --> 11:45.560
Obviously the principal.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.738
In fact, you as a parent trust the principal to
create a safe environment for the kids— true?

11:53.660 --> 11:55.740
Yes, that's true.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.310
That didn't go very well, did it?

11:57.350 --> 11:58.740
It could've been better.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.450
I'm sorry i haven't been better.

12:00.490 --> 12:02.420
You've been great.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.370
So now what?

12:03.380 --> 12:06.670
Well, we give our summations,
and then the judge will rule.

12:06.710 --> 12:11.260
Jerry, I appreciate your
efforts, especially after…

12:11.270 --> 12:13.440
I am sorry.

12:15.790 --> 12:17.250
It's okay.

12:17.260 --> 12:18.360
Life goes on.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.980
Ob-la-di, c'est
la vie, sacre bleu.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.320
Will you ever forgive me?

12:24.250 --> 12:25.590
Leigh…

12:25.600 --> 12:29.390
right now I need to
concentrate on the case.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.510
Wait a second.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.920
You're actually asking
me to order an abortion?

12:32.960 --> 12:33.810
I am, judge.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.100
Isn't it exciting?
–No.

12:35.140 --> 12:36.860
Well, then let's reframe the issue.

12:36.900 --> 12:41.830
Let's just say we're here so that you may stop
her from profiting from stealing this man's sperm.

12:41.870 --> 12:42.910
What do you mean, she stole it?

12:42.950 --> 12:44.480
I mean they did not have intercourse.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.210
It was never his intent
to even have oral sex.

12:47.250 --> 12:50.780
So let me tell you exactly how she
came into possession of his sperm.

12:50.820 --> 12:52.370
I think I know.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.620
How did she get pregnant?

12:53.660 --> 12:56.790
She put the ill-gotten proceeds in
a test tube, popped it in the fridge,

12:56.830 --> 13:00.922
a shower and gargle, and off to
the fertility clinic she went.

13:01.090 --> 13:02.030
Okay.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.970
I want you in that chair.

13:03.980 --> 13:07.630
Your honor, it doesn't matter how
this pregnancy came to be. You can't—

13:07.670 --> 13:09.150
It— it matters to me.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.770
Hold on, sir.

13:12.060 --> 13:15.820
You… in that chair, after lunch.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.720
We're adjourned.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.720
Can you imagine?

13:25.730 --> 13:28.172
The judge is going to have a hearing.

13:29.710 --> 13:30.670
Well…

13:30.680 --> 13:32.440
Well, what?

13:32.450 --> 13:36.770
Well… well, Shirley, what
if somebody stole your eggs?

13:36.780 --> 13:37.680
How would you feel?

13:37.720 --> 13:39.820
My eggs are on display at
the natural history museum.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.120
Anybody can walk in and take them.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.290
No, I know. I'm serious.

13:42.330 --> 13:43.610
This man was violated.

13:43.650 --> 13:44.840
Even so.

13:44.850 --> 13:46.940
A court-ordered abortion?

13:46.950 --> 13:50.980
Courts have terminated pregnancies before,
either for mentally handicapped women or—

13:51.020 --> 13:53.300
Missy is not retarded.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.110
You had her tested?

13:57.480 --> 13:59.610
Carl, I'm— I'm
surprised at you.

13:59.620 --> 14:01.030
Well, you know what? I'm
surprised at you, Shirley.

14:01.070 --> 14:02.730
Your fairness compass
is always spot-on.

14:02.770 --> 14:04.740
It's fritzing out here.

14:04.940 --> 14:07.180
We're now having a fight.

14:07.190 --> 14:09.962
Which you're losing,
and that bothers you.

14:09.970 --> 14:15.370
You actually believe a judge should be
able to order a woman to have an abortion?

14:15.380 --> 14:19.770
I think they should be
loathe to do so, but yes.

14:31.690 --> 14:32.960
Fine.

14:37.450 --> 14:39.160
You're looking for me?

14:39.170 --> 14:40.360
Yes.

14:41.930 --> 14:46.730
I was wondering if you could join
me after lunch for about an hour.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.730
What have you got in mind?

14:50.590 --> 14:51.720
Heartburn.

14:51.730 --> 14:53.220
I have a case.

14:53.230 --> 14:58.160
I could use a woman at the table to
preempt any charges of chauvinism since—

14:58.200 --> 14:58.890
No, thank you.

14:58.930 --> 15:01.300
I know about your case, Alan.
It's repugnant.

15:01.340 --> 15:03.910
And good luck trying to find
any woman to sit at your table.

15:03.950 --> 15:05.450
Strict.

15:05.460 --> 15:10.200
Lorraine, let's just put, uh, gender
politics aside for the moment and focus—

15:10.240 --> 15:13.810
That's cute. Like leaving
bias out of prejudice.

15:13.820 --> 15:16.170
I don't really think that can
be done, Alan, not even by you.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.650
So, sorry.

15:17.660 --> 15:19.480
I hope you lose.

15:19.490 --> 15:20.730
Bye, Denny.

15:24.470 --> 15:26.500
I really don't get it.

15:27.050 --> 15:31.420
I agree it's a woman's body, and
therefore her rights should take priority.

15:31.460 --> 15:37.320
But what's the rationale that justifies
excising the man completely from the equation?

15:37.330 --> 15:38.930
They got us on this one, Alan.

15:38.970 --> 15:43.680
Until the supreme court fixes the problem
—and they're handpicked to do so— they got us.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.590
Their rights, their body, period.

15:45.630 --> 15:47.190
And they have those, too.

15:47.230 --> 15:50.140
So it all evens out.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.430
Denny Crane.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.430
You heard it here.

16:05.890 --> 16:07.600
I've always wanted to have a baby.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.480
Of course, with the right man.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.160
Terrence was right for me.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.120
We fell in love so quickly.

16:13.130 --> 16:14.540
At least, I did.

16:14.550 --> 16:16.050
After two dates?

16:16.060 --> 16:17.980
Look at him. He's gorgeous!

16:17.990 --> 16:21.610
The thought of having beautiful,
mocha-chocolata bambinos with him…

16:21.650 --> 16:23.380
ooh, it brings a
flutter to my—

16:23.420 --> 16:24.930
Missy!

16:28.440 --> 16:29.958
What the hell was that?

16:30.200 --> 16:34.094
My—my client's in a form of
music therapy to combat stress.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.560
Just one note is more than enough.

16:36.570 --> 16:37.840
Music therapy?

16:37.850 --> 16:39.030
Yes, your honor.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.840
I like to look at life as a big musical.

16:41.850 --> 16:45.210
The night I met Terrence,
it was a musical.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.790
Can you tell us about the
night that you conceived?

16:50.830 --> 16:53.460
Well, as I said, it was magical.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.130
We had gone to a club.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.810
We danced. We snuggled. We giggled.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.620
And after the club?

16:59.630 --> 17:05.420
We went back to my place, had some
wine, and we got romantic, at least I did.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.089
He looked at me, I looked at him,

17:08.880 --> 17:12.460
and we both knew, at least I did.

17:12.470 --> 17:16.670
♫ Have to believe we are magic ♫

17:19.640 --> 17:23.660
And you got pregnant at a fertility
clinic with Terrence's sperm?

17:23.700 --> 17:29.050
Yes, after our seminal moment together, I
put the goods in a little test tubey,

17:29.060 --> 17:31.790
took it the lab, and
they put it in the oven.

17:31.830 --> 17:36.550
When it bakes, soon I'll
have my little Obama baby.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.790
Thank you.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.510
She's all yours.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.790
I don't really want her.

17:44.050 --> 17:46.350
I suppose I'm obliged.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.020
Missy.
–Hello!

17:48.600 --> 17:50.920
You wish you and Terrence
were together, don't you?

17:50.960 --> 17:51.780
I do.

17:51.790 --> 17:53.090
But if you
can't have him—

17:53.130 --> 17:54.600
I'll have his baby.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.950
Have you thought for one second
how this would affect Terrence?

18:02.990 --> 18:07.050
Well, I would hope he'd
be happy, for me, for us.

18:07.060 --> 18:09.350
–And if he's not?
–Tough.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.560
This may be a rhetorical
question, but let me ask it anyway:

18:14.600 --> 18:17.240
Do you think you're fit
to be anybody's mother?

18:17.280 --> 18:18.470
–Objection.
–Sustained.

18:18.510 --> 18:21.400
No. I'd like to respond to that.

18:21.410 --> 18:25.080
Go ahead, without song.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.900
I will be a good mother.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.340
I'm sorry Mr Man
doesn't want this child.

18:34.350 --> 18:36.990
That's too bad for me.
It's too bad for the baby.

18:37.030 --> 18:39.530
And let's not forget,
there is a baby here.

18:39.570 --> 18:41.600
There's another life involved.

18:41.610 --> 18:44.560
If you want to vilify me,
punish me, go ahead.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.870
But do not punish this child.

18:46.880 --> 18:51.490
It is grossly unfair to do
so with the death penalty.

18:57.780 --> 19:00.430
I feel like the big monster now.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.000
You're not a monster, Mr Maxwell.

19:03.290 --> 19:05.770
You're actually being quite heroic.

19:05.780 --> 19:10.360
You're giving voice to a male
outrage that's long overdue.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.360
For women to be
able to just—

19:12.400 --> 19:14.110
It's not just that.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.020
It's the idea of that woman.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.800
I mean, there's assimilation
and there's assimilation.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.860
That woman should not be allowed to
parent a black child or a half-black child.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.690
There, I said it.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.420
Should I say it in court?

19:27.690 --> 19:30.490
Terrence, there's no real
advantage in you testifying,

19:30.530 --> 19:36.180
and I don't want to give them the opportunity
to portray you as someone other than who you are.

19:36.220 --> 19:37.500
So what now?

19:37.510 --> 19:40.546
You give one of those
big, long speeches then?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.850
Yes.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.220
I do that.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.850
I think the judge liked
my singing. Don't you?

19:47.890 --> 19:49.260
–How could she not?
–Shirley.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.710
Ah, Carl, still alive. Well…

19:51.980 --> 19:54.030
That's mature.

19:54.660 --> 19:58.440
Anything you say bounces
off me and sticks to you.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.580
Fighting?

20:03.590 --> 20:04.890
We are.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.980
Problem?

20:18.990 --> 20:21.310
Working on my closing.

20:21.770 --> 20:23.900
I may have to use the cigarette.

20:23.910 --> 20:24.630
Why?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.760
Well, this issue…

20:26.770 --> 20:27.870
Hugging?

20:27.880 --> 20:30.586
I'm finding it very
hard to get a rhythm.

20:34.140 --> 20:35.270
Do you know…

20:35.280 --> 20:41.720
my mother hugged me a
grand total of two times?

20:41.730 --> 20:42.950
One was by accident.

20:42.990 --> 20:46.710
She thought I was choking and
performed the Heimlich maneuver.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.050
Did your father hug you?

20:48.090 --> 20:51.740
No. He believed in firm handshakes.

20:51.750 --> 20:57.360
Which was pretty much a bust since I could
rarely convince my hand to leave my thigh.

20:58.070 --> 21:04.820
The first hug I ever got, truly, was
a couple years ago, from Alan.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.860
Really?

21:11.560 --> 21:14.000
Have you got another
one of those I could use?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.100
I have to close against Alan Shore.

21:16.140 --> 21:17.580
He's really good, isn't he?

21:17.620 --> 21:19.040
The best I've ever seen.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.130
Thank you for that.

21:20.170 --> 21:22.370
Katie, I've seen you in the courtroom.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.350
You don't need to be afraid of anybody.

21:24.390 --> 21:26.400
Even Alan Shore?

21:26.410 --> 21:28.910
Here's the thing with Alan…

21:30.740 --> 21:36.250
he likes to get dominion of the room
and keep opposing counsel off balance.

21:36.260 --> 21:38.420
Just don't let him.

21:38.430 --> 21:41.520
Also, when his case
wobbles —and here it does—

21:41.530 --> 21:46.220
he tries to reframe the
issue into one that suits him.

21:46.230 --> 21:48.270
He's very clever that way.

21:48.280 --> 21:51.540
Don't let him.

21:52.430 --> 21:53.330
Listen to me.

21:53.340 --> 21:55.890
I feel I'm being disloyal to him.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.680
You're being very loyal to me.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.470
I appreciate it.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.900
Jerry, you are a dear, dear friend.

22:06.690 --> 22:07.990
Leigh!

22:08.530 --> 22:09.400
Hello.

22:09.410 --> 22:11.460
Welcome.
–Welcome. Hello.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.450
Are you two boyfriend and girlfriend?

22:17.820 --> 22:21.360
No, we're work friends, colleagues.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.190
Good-bye.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.920
Somebody still seems
a little smitten, Jerry.

22:38.670 --> 22:41.110
This isn't the only school
with a no-hug policy.

22:41.150 --> 22:43.370
Many, many others are
doing the same thing.

22:43.410 --> 22:46.890
And it isn't just because
they're litigation averse.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.660
It's for the children.

22:48.670 --> 22:49.850
The statistics don't lie.

22:49.890 --> 22:55.040
Many of the worst and most far-reaching cases
of abuse happen at the hands of trusted adults,

22:55.080 --> 23:00.050
be it a priest or a
teacher or a relative.

23:00.060 --> 23:01.400
Does this policy go too far?

23:01.440 --> 23:04.050
I'm sure some would say it does.

23:04.780 --> 23:08.050
But on what side do we want to err here?

23:35.350 --> 23:38.050
It's not just happening at schools.

23:38.060 --> 23:41.790
Many corporations and businesses
now forbid physical contact.

23:41.830 --> 23:44.180
It cuts down on sexual
harassment lawsuits.

23:44.220 --> 23:49.370
Perhaps with the continued evolution of
smartphones and mails and video conferencing,

23:49.410 --> 23:53.140
we'll find a way to keep people from
ever being in the same room together.

23:53.180 --> 23:55.570
Won't that be wonderful?

23:55.580 --> 24:00.350
Years ago they did an experiment
with an orphaned baby monkey.

24:00.630 --> 24:04.000
They gave it two
choices for a surrogate—

24:04.010 --> 24:08.100
one which could provide
milk, the other a hug.

24:08.700 --> 24:11.110
The monkey chose the hug.

24:18.890 --> 24:22.720
I'm sure we all saw this picture
in the newspapers a few months ago.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.940
Yes, very sweet.

24:24.950 --> 24:30.400
But for my money, one case of
child abuse trumps a cute monkey.

24:30.590 --> 24:32.550
Yes, your honor.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.350
I grew up… with…

24:39.720 --> 24:42.730
various social disabilities.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.240
I had no friends.

24:44.250 --> 24:49.080
I got a job that only
required I write memorandums.

24:49.090 --> 24:55.140
I lived, basically, a life
with no real human contact.

24:55.150 --> 24:58.410
My client is an objectophile.

24:58.420 --> 25:04.340
Both of us improved through
the kindness, compassion and yes,

25:04.350 --> 25:07.200
physical affection of others.

25:07.210 --> 25:10.400
The human touch cannot be quantified.

25:10.410 --> 25:13.560
It cannot be analyzed with statistics.

25:13.570 --> 25:16.910
We can't place a number
on it, but it is much,

25:16.920 --> 25:20.940
much more than a doorway
to sexual molestation.

25:20.950 --> 25:23.500
It's the best, the most direct,

25:23.510 --> 25:28.380
the most lasting way of affirming
another person's humanity.

25:28.390 --> 25:32.950
Leigh Swift was trying to comfort
a student who was suffering.

25:32.960 --> 25:36.760
What policy can possibly justify

25:36.770 --> 25:39.530
firing her for that?

25:56.580 --> 25:58.730
Six years ago…

25:58.740 --> 26:01.860
isolation had brought me to the point…

26:01.870 --> 26:04.940
I considered taking my life.

26:05.530 --> 26:10.270
I picked up the phone
and punched out 4-1-1,

26:10.280 --> 26:15.470
so desperate was I to hear just
the sound of another person's voice.

26:16.040 --> 26:22.110
I got some automated recording that
said,“what city and state, please?”

26:23.020 --> 26:25.360
And I wept.

26:25.370 --> 26:29.750
We are living in such an increasingly
isolated world, your honor.

26:30.270 --> 26:32.480
We… I.M

26:32.490 --> 26:37.710
and text message and have
virtual relationships online.

26:37.720 --> 26:40.370
It gets lonelier and lonelier

26:40.380 --> 26:44.220
while teenage and adult
depression continues to rise.

26:44.230 --> 26:48.290
There are perhaps many
things we can do about it.

26:48.950 --> 26:51.770
Banning the hug…

26:51.780 --> 26:54.670
can't be one of them.

27:08.050 --> 27:13.590
The thing about women, Carl, if you
reject their opinions, their principles,

27:13.910 --> 27:16.200
they feel you're rejecting
them, which is so wrong,

27:16.240 --> 27:19.120
since with most relationships,
we're in it only for the sex.

27:19.160 --> 27:24.572
Uh, you won't be getting any, by the way,
from Shirley, unless you agree with her.

27:25.160 --> 27:25.660
I don't know, Denny.

27:25.700 --> 27:29.710
Maybe Shirley and I aren't
right for each other.

27:29.990 --> 27:32.200
Don't go overreacting now.

27:32.210 --> 27:34.610
You ever wonder if all
relationships are finite?

27:34.650 --> 27:35.430
Of course they are.

27:35.470 --> 27:39.060
That's why we have kids, marriage
vows, onerous divorce laws—

27:39.100 --> 27:41.640
all to make it too impossible
to leave once we know it's over.

27:41.680 --> 27:44.610
We're a pro-marriage nation.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.940
That's very cynical, Denny.

27:47.610 --> 27:48.640
Would you marry Shirley?

27:48.680 --> 27:50.240
In a second. May I?

27:50.250 --> 27:51.990
I think she would want a say.

27:52.030 --> 27:54.090
Yes, therein lies the problem.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.550
Marriage, abortion, you name it…

27:56.560 --> 28:00.600
we were much better off in the
old days, before women got a say.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.450
Supreme court will get us back there.

28:02.490 --> 28:04.930
Just give 'em time.

28:09.460 --> 28:14.340
All right, before we
begin: Ms Tiggs, no singing.

28:14.590 --> 28:20.100
If you so much as accidentally hit a note while
clearing your throat, I will rule in his favor.

28:20.140 --> 28:22.030
You got that?
–Yes, your honor.

28:22.070 --> 28:25.350
All right, now, Mr Shore,
you can't stand before me

28:25.390 --> 28:29.690
and tell me you expect this court or any
court to order that a woman get an abortion.

28:29.730 --> 28:31.150
That's exactly what I expect.

28:31.190 --> 28:35.190
The idea is appalling to you because next to the
“n” word, only the “a” word is more controversial.

28:35.230 --> 28:39.650
Only the “a” word can stir up such
deep-seated passion, not of love,

28:39.690 --> 28:44.260
which one might hope for when thinking of life
and its conception, but rather of anger and rage.

28:44.300 --> 28:47.200
In fact, there isn't any issue
in this country as combustible.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.790
My advice here would be to not
think of it as the “a” word at all.

28:49.830 --> 28:54.370
Let's just think of it as requiring this woman who
flagrantly and deliberately defrauded my client,

28:54.410 --> 28:56.700
requiring her to simply
take a pill, some medication.

28:56.740 --> 28:57.790
We do it all the time.

28:57.830 --> 29:00.460
We force medicate in psychiatric
hospitals, a place where,

29:00.500 --> 29:02.320
ironically, this woman
should certainly be stuck.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.420
Will you slow the hell down?

29:04.430 --> 29:07.010
Under the law, judge,
there is no life here.

29:07.050 --> 29:08.070
She's five weeks pregnant.

29:08.110 --> 29:10.630
At five weeks, there is no
life recognized by the law.

29:10.670 --> 29:11.670
Mr Shore is incorrect.

29:11.710 --> 29:14.160
The relevant case law
goes only to viability.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.850
It makes no determination
as to when human life begins.

29:16.890 --> 29:20.320
And whatever one's opinion may be on
abortion, we can't dispute that life,

29:20.360 --> 29:22.540
however embryonic,
originates at conception.

29:22.580 --> 29:26.640
But the only issue today is: can the
court invade the autonomy of her body.

29:26.680 --> 29:27.160
And I would say yes.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.700
We're not talking about
an intrusive procedure.

29:29.740 --> 29:33.950
We're asking that she take a pill, a
little tablet, like an aspirin—the RU-486.

29:33.990 --> 29:36.340
It's very effective, the side
effects are rare, and it's safe.

29:36.380 --> 29:38.880
I can't speak as to when Mr
Shore had his last abortion,

29:38.920 --> 29:42.100
but they are anything but a
breeze, even with the RU-486.

29:42.140 --> 29:46.110
It presents the same symptoms as a
miscarriage, including cramping, bleeding.

29:46.150 --> 29:49.680
It could take days or even weeks, and that's not
even accounting for the emotional aftereffects,

29:49.720 --> 29:50.980
which could last a lifetime.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.680
–This woman hijacked my sperm.
–Mr Maxwell—

29:53.720 --> 29:55.350
I love it when he calls me woman.

29:55.390 --> 29:57.290
I did not have intercourse
with her that night.

29:57.330 --> 29:57.940
Why?

29:57.950 --> 30:00.650
Because I did not want to run
the risk of getting her pregnant.

30:00.690 --> 30:03.190
I would submit that Mr Maxwell
has various legal remedies.

30:03.230 --> 30:06.460
He can sue her in a civil court for damages,
though she's not asking for child support—

30:06.500 --> 30:09.320
Oh, and now who's not accounting
for the emotional aftereffects?

30:09.360 --> 30:12.780
Where is it written that,“hey, if he doesn't
have to contribute to the raising of the child,

30:12.820 --> 30:13.590
then it's no harm, no foul”?

30:13.630 --> 30:14.380
Mr Shore—

30:14.390 --> 30:17.270
It's my flesh and blood. My child.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.190
And you want to kill it.

30:18.230 --> 30:19.970
All right.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.170
Tempers are
starting to flare—

30:21.210 --> 30:22.260
Yes, they are, judge.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.000
As I said, this is an angry topic.

30:24.040 --> 30:27.310
And one of the reasons we're also
enraged is we never got a say.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.430
The american public never
got a vote on abortion.

30:29.470 --> 30:32.320
It was decided by <i>fiat</i>—
nine men sitting on a court.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.350
Why we don't put the issue on
a ballot completely escapes me.

30:35.390 --> 30:40.660
Especially since our judicial selection process has
now become so corrupted by the politics of abortion,

30:40.700 --> 30:43.220
as our presidential and
congressional campaigns have.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.250
But we the people, we don't get a vote.

30:45.290 --> 30:48.350
And it leaves us feeling
frustrated and angry, powerless.

30:48.390 --> 30:49.620
Can you imagine?

30:49.630 --> 30:54.070
This issue that goes to the core of our
human values, and we don't get to weigh in?

30:54.110 --> 30:58.000
We have to sit back and watch a president
puppeteered by the religious right,

30:58.040 --> 30:59.570
stacking the deck, in
the supreme court—

30:59.610 --> 31:00.510
You're getting off point.

31:00.550 --> 31:02.360
No, I'm very much on point.

31:02.370 --> 31:05.710
You take that sense of helplessness
and rage that the public feels,

31:05.750 --> 31:09.580
multiply it times 1,000, and you
get a sense of what my client feels.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.650
Somebody would be having his
baby, and he doesn't even get a say?

31:12.690 --> 31:14.630
He wasn't careless or cavalier.

31:14.670 --> 31:16.660
He was tricked, deceived, defrauded,

31:16.700 --> 31:18.620
and he has no rights here at all?

31:18.660 --> 31:21.650
He should be afforded all his rights
under the law, and under the law today,

31:21.690 --> 31:26.870
the court cannot and should not order a woman
to undergo an intrusive medical procedure.

31:26.910 --> 31:32.982
Can there be anything more medically, physically
and emotionally intrusive than an abortion?

31:37.110 --> 31:40.940
I'm sorry, but at the risk of
sounding very politically incorrect,

31:40.980 --> 31:44.700
as much as we're all supportive
of multicultural families—

31:44.740 --> 31:48.680
it's become so fashionable to adopt exotic
babies from different lands and places—

31:48.720 --> 31:52.610
but I'm sorry, that woman makes Julie
Andrews seem like a black panther.

31:52.650 --> 31:54.800
She has no conception of black culture.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.230
This is wrong.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.450
There, I said it. Everyone can
start writing their letters.

31:58.490 --> 32:02.846
Maybe the should be some kind of
a test one has to pass. But that…

32:05.140 --> 32:07.640
I've probably said enough.

32:08.380 --> 32:10.520
Yes, you have.

32:23.080 --> 32:23.970
Any word?

32:23.980 --> 32:28.390
No, but she promised to rule
by the end of the day, so…

32:29.230 --> 32:31.430
Terrence…

32:32.390 --> 32:34.470
suppose we do win?

32:34.480 --> 32:37.180
You can certainly expect a
whole lot more of all this.

32:37.220 --> 32:40.800
The appeals court, the state
supreme court, the supreme court—

32:40.840 --> 32:43.970
by that time, she'll have had the baby.

32:44.400 --> 32:49.090
Are you prepared to
push this all the way?

32:49.100 --> 32:50.800
Maybe not.

32:51.220 --> 32:54.840
Even if we win, I mean, I don't
know if I can make her terminate.

32:54.880 --> 32:55.720
Then why?

32:55.730 --> 32:58.110
I don't know. Maybe empowerment.

32:58.120 --> 32:59.620
Maybe…

32:59.630 --> 33:02.520
I just want it to be my choice, too.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.660
That crazy?

33:07.230 --> 33:09.750
It isn't crazy at all.

33:14.740 --> 33:18.840
Nobody said “all rise”, but… okay.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.670
I agree completely with Mr Espenson.

33:24.680 --> 33:29.940
To ban a simple hug seems way
too far-reaching, if not draconian.

33:29.950 --> 33:33.910
I'm mindful, however, that we
have thousands and thousands

33:33.920 --> 33:37.590
of unlawful sexual touchings
on school campuses every year,

33:37.630 --> 33:40.000
committed by both teachers and students.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.970
It's a tough call.

33:41.980 --> 33:44.760
What tips it for me are
the facts of this case.

33:44.800 --> 33:50.700
The plaintiff suffers from
objectophilia, a diagnosed sexual disorder.

33:50.710 --> 33:56.210
Add to that she had been warned on prior
occasions not to touch the students.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.820
Judgment for the defendant.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.550
Poop! Withdrawn.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.560
We're adjourned.

34:07.370 --> 34:08.900
I'm sorry, Leigh.

34:08.909 --> 34:10.400
Me, too.

34:11.760 --> 34:15.150
Thank you so much for trying, Jerry.

34:15.159 --> 34:17.250
You fought very valiantly.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.469
I'm sorry we didn't get a good result.

34:19.510 --> 34:21.360
Yes.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.270
Speaking of trying…

34:25.280 --> 34:28.409
would you like to give us a try again?

34:34.040 --> 34:36.580
I don't know. I…

34:36.590 --> 34:42.110
I don't think I can compete with an
iPhone. I don't know that any man could.

34:43.460 --> 34:48.139
My therapist thinks I'm gravitating
to things because they can't dump me.

34:48.179 --> 34:50.600
I got scared with you, Jerry.

34:50.610 --> 34:56.530
I suppose I want safety in a relation-
ship, but I realize nobody gets that.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.800
I don't know what to say.

34:59.810 --> 35:01.570
How about yes?

35:02.400 --> 35:06.340
How about we just hug
and see how it feels?

35:39.030 --> 35:44.980
If you ask me, we've seen a great evolution
in fatherhood over the last 20, 30 years.

35:45.390 --> 35:49.610
We now have stay-at-home dads,
fathers who are the primary caregivers.

35:49.650 --> 35:53.000
Pretty damn good progress
from my perspective.

35:53.010 --> 35:58.240
When it comes to a father's legal
rights, however, the law has stayed stagnant.

35:59.670 --> 36:02.060
Ms Tiggs…

36:02.070 --> 36:05.620
your behavior here is disgusting.

36:05.630 --> 36:09.620
You knew this man did not want
to father a child with you.

36:09.630 --> 36:14.290
You performed a sex act on him to
come in possession of his sperm.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.570
You used that sperm
to impregnate yourself.

36:17.580 --> 36:21.630
If the law permitted, I would
have you thrown in jail.

36:23.300 --> 36:27.320
But I end exactly where I began.

36:27.330 --> 36:31.800
No court, including this one,
is going to order an abortion.

36:32.130 --> 36:38.470
Mr Maxwell, your damages here, if
any, would be legal, not equitable.

36:38.900 --> 36:42.230
Motion denied. We're adjourned.

36:44.020 --> 36:45.950
–Well, we tried.
–Yeah.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.840
Thanks, Mr Shore.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.610
Thank you, Shirley, Katie.

36:51.820 --> 36:53.340
I'm going to be a mom.

36:53.350 --> 36:55.700
And I'll… bet a wonderful one at that.

36:55.740 --> 36:59.130
Well, best of luck, Missy.
Let's get out of here.

37:03.590 --> 37:05.710
I gotta be involved.

37:05.720 --> 37:08.660
If I'm gonna be a father,
then I'm gonna be a father.

37:08.700 --> 37:09.810
I'd like that.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.310
Not about you.

37:13.620 --> 37:15.700
Terrence.

37:16.970 --> 37:19.620
Maybe you and I could give it a go.

37:19.630 --> 37:21.600
I really, really like you.

37:21.610 --> 37:26.758
It's not every day I meet a truly noble
person who makes my genitalia flutter.

37:28.260 --> 37:30.980
I can't be with you, Missy.

37:30.990 --> 37:35.016
We'll work out this parenting
thing, but I can't be with you.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.310
Okay.

37:43.140 --> 37:49.150
♫ A place where nobody dared to go

37:50.000 --> 37:53.820
♫ the love that we came to know ♫

37:54.360 --> 37:56.020
Bye, Missy.

37:57.450 --> 38:01.620
♫ They call it Xanadu

38:04.500 --> 38:10.410
♫ and now open your eyes and see

38:12.110 --> 38:15.260
♫ what we have made is real

38:16.390 --> 38:19.650
♫ we call it Xanadu ♫

38:24.940 --> 38:28.350
So Katie kicked your ass.

38:29.630 --> 38:31.580
Let me tell you something
about this Katie Lloyd.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.610
She is going to be some lawyer.

38:33.650 --> 38:37.460
For her to be this good already,
just out of law school, it's scary.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.050
How far women have come.

38:40.060 --> 38:42.530
They used to be objects we
just wanted to have sex with.

38:42.570 --> 38:47.430
Now they're intelligent, autonomous, powerful
things we just want to have sex with.

38:47.470 --> 38:49.750
We may even have a woman
as president, Denny.

38:49.790 --> 38:53.810
I had a dream about her as
president— Hillary, you know.

38:53.820 --> 38:55.530
Tell me.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.830
She invited me into the oval office.

38:57.870 --> 39:00.180
We had tea, discussed politics, then…

39:00.220 --> 39:01.730
we got right down to it.

39:01.770 --> 39:04.320
She was fantastic.

39:04.330 --> 39:05.740
You had a Hillary sex dream?

39:05.780 --> 39:11.550
Oh, she is so hot, Alan, in a
dominatrix-praying-mantis sort of way.

39:12.580 --> 39:15.990
I'd like to have one night
alone with that tramp.

39:18.970 --> 39:20.530
What?

39:20.990 --> 39:23.750
You have been cranky this week.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.810
Is everything okay?

39:24.850 --> 39:25.500
Fine.

39:25.510 --> 39:26.150
Something's wrong.

39:26.190 --> 39:28.380
Nothing's wrong.

39:28.390 --> 39:30.030
Fine.

39:35.610 --> 39:39.840
My sophomore year in college,
I got my girlfriend pregnant.

39:39.850 --> 39:44.320
She came to me, told me,
and then proceeded to say,

39:44.330 --> 39:47.140
“don't worry, I've
already taken care of it.”

39:47.180 --> 39:49.430
It was done. It had already been done.

39:49.470 --> 39:55.390
And I realized that she had
probably been scared and…

39:56.310 --> 40:00.770
confused, but I felt
completely invisible,

40:00.780 --> 40:03.660
as if I had no ability to express

40:03.670 --> 40:07.720
love, care, support.

40:07.730 --> 40:12.210
But for me to have no voice,
as if I had no opinion…

40:13.670 --> 40:16.960
when it would have been my child, too…

40:17.720 --> 40:20.010
such prejudice against men.

40:20.020 --> 40:25.070
The issue is always about forcing us to
take responsibility, never about our rights.

40:25.110 --> 40:28.740
There's a conversation men could
have with women before having sex.

40:28.780 --> 40:30.760
Perhaps an understanding
should be reached before—

40:30.800 --> 40:33.610
No, it's hard enough
to get the condom on.

40:33.620 --> 40:36.524
Now you want to add
conversation to the mix?

40:39.060 --> 40:44.030
How many times have you had that
problem taken care of with women?

40:46.210 --> 40:47.480
I don't know.

40:47.490 --> 40:50.690
On the one hand, I want
to perpetuate the species.

40:50.730 --> 40:52.670
I am, after all, Denny Crane.

40:52.680 --> 40:57.640
On the other hand, imagine the world—
kids running around with mad calves disease.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.620
I shudder.

41:00.860 --> 41:03.900
Don't you want to be
a father someday, Alan?

41:04.600 --> 41:06.720
I don't know.

41:07.540 --> 41:08.800
It'll happen.

41:08.810 --> 41:11.010
Can I be godfather?

41:11.020 --> 41:12.810
He'll need somebody to
tell him about women.

41:12.850 --> 41:15.340
He can't have that discussion with dad.

41:15.380 --> 41:18.050
You still want that son, don't you?

41:19.610 --> 41:22.890
Take him fishing, teach
him to drive a stick.

41:22.900 --> 41:28.312
When he gets older, he can introduce me
to some of his girlfriends. It's all good.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.620
People say having a family…

41:31.930 --> 41:33.890
that's everything.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.530
Are we missing out, Denny?

41:37.740 --> 41:41.160
Well, I feel I have a
family of sorts here.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.400
I don't think it's the same.

41:43.410 --> 41:45.280
I've got you.

41:45.580 --> 41:47.310
You've got me.

41:47.320 --> 41:49.500
And I feel blessed.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.970
How many people have that?

41:53.980 --> 41:55.270
Not enough.
