what's really a shame

09:09.463 --> 09:10.863
is being one of the leads
in the hottest show

09:10.897 --> 09:12.782
on tour right now,

09:12.816 --> 09:13.976
and regretting
taking the job.

09:14.001 --> 09:17.503
If you regret it so much,
why not come back?

09:17.537 --> 09:18.921
No, I wasn't...

09:18.955 --> 09:22.591
I'm sure I could
find a place for you here.

09:22.625 --> 09:23.976
Could you
excuse us a minute?

09:24.027 --> 09:26.779
Yeah.

09:26.813 --> 09:28.614
You can't
offer him a role.

09:28.648 --> 09:31.200
There's nothing left,
besides Gladys.

09:31.234 --> 09:32.768
Even our swings
are hired.

09:32.802 --> 09:34.170
You heard him.
He's not happy.

09:34.204 --> 09:35.437
I can find something.

09:35.455 --> 09:39.625
Not without
losing something.

09:39.659 --> 09:42.244
I miss him.
He should be here.

09:42.279 --> 09:45.731
We're not going
to lose anything, trust me.

09:49.185 --> 09:50.803
I tried
to stop her.

09:50.837 --> 09:53.856
Oh, you can't, Mia.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.991
She hasn't stopped moving
since the '70s.

09:56.025 --> 09:58.661
So your name
came up this morning,

09:58.695 --> 10:00.513
and I said
to my publicist,

10:00.564 --> 10:02.048
"there must be
some sort of mistake,

10:02.082 --> 10:06.368
"because the Richard Francis
I know adores a good story,

10:06.386 --> 10:09.238
he adores good theater,
and he adores me."

10:09.272 --> 10:13.259
The problem is, you don't
have a good story, Eileen.

10:13.293 --> 10:17.063
I am in rehearsal
for the biggest musical

10:17.097 --> 10:18.914
yet to be seen
on Broadway,

10:18.949 --> 10:21.384
one that I am back
in control of.

10:21.418 --> 10:22.334
Yeah, but it's been
done to death

10:22.369 --> 10:23.436
in the gossip columns.

10:23.470 --> 10:25.321
Feuding actresses,
oversexed directors,

10:25.355 --> 10:26.555
divorce, betrayal,

10:26.590 --> 10:28.974
and not right
for the New York Times.

10:29.009 --> 10:31.143
Richard, why don't you
come on down to rehearsal?

10:31.194 --> 10:34.296
You can be the first reporter
to see Bombshell redux.

10:34.331 --> 10:37.266
Perhaps you can even
find a new angle.

10:41.405 --> 10:42.571
Ohh.

10:42.605 --> 10:44.907
Locked in the bedroom
at your own party?

10:44.941 --> 10:46.642
You look like me
at my sweet sixteen.

10:46.676 --> 10:50.413
I'm going through the script,
trying to find a place for Sam.

10:50.447 --> 10:52.848
And you're right.
There's nothing.

10:52.883 --> 10:55.384
At least you tried.

10:55.402 --> 10:58.854
You know what I think
you should do tonight?

10:58.872 --> 11:01.056
Drink champagne. Have
fun with your friends.

11:01.091 --> 11:02.475
You've earned
that much.

11:02.509 --> 11:05.661
And tomorrow, you can tell Sam
that you couldn't make it work.

11:05.695 --> 11:08.547
He'll understand.

11:08.582 --> 11:11.567
Ah, I told you
he'd be in here.

11:11.601 --> 11:13.101
What's going on?

11:13.120 --> 11:15.855
Everyone wants to sing.
Come and play for us.

11:15.889 --> 11:17.573
I'm working.

11:17.607 --> 11:18.641
The man doesn't even
have a drink.

11:18.675 --> 11:20.826
Let's get the man
a drink.

11:20.861 --> 11:23.796
- One drink.
- One drink?

11:28.718 --> 11:32.571
- Uh, that's my shirt.
- No, I think it's mine.

11:32.606 --> 11:33.672
Oh, yeah,
did you, uh,

11:33.707 --> 11:35.341
go to Fort Hamilton
in Brooklyn?

11:35.375 --> 11:36.675
Not technically.

11:36.710 --> 11:39.127
But see the way
the fabric's worn through?

11:39.146 --> 11:40.146
Mm.

11:40.180 --> 11:42.298
The neckline
is stretched out

11:42.332 --> 11:47.369
so it falls off one shoulder
like that?

11:47.387 --> 11:51.023
That makes it a girl's shirt.
Can I have it?

11:51.057 --> 11:56.211
Well, you certainly look better
in it than I do, that's for sure.

11:56.229 --> 12:01.316
Hey, what if Amanda
stole a t-shirt from Jesse

12:01.334 --> 12:02.551
the night
they were together?

12:02.586 --> 12:05.254
And then, later on,
he sees her wearing it

12:05.288 --> 12:06.505
in one of her videos...

12:06.540 --> 12:08.824
- Like she's taunting him.
- Or missing him.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.576
You should tell Derek
about that.

12:10.627 --> 12:11.644
Why don't you?

12:11.678 --> 12:13.345
He doesn't really
seem interested

12:13.380 --> 12:15.014
in anything
I have to say.

12:15.048 --> 12:17.132
To be fair, you're not
really listening to him, either.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.852
You may let him push you
around, but I don't have to.

12:19.886 --> 12:22.421
I don't let him
push me around.

12:22.472 --> 12:23.989
I didn't get him
at first,

12:24.024 --> 12:26.442
but once I clicked
into the way he directs,

12:26.476 --> 12:28.110
we started connecting.

12:28.128 --> 12:29.478
No, no,
I'm pretty sure

12:29.513 --> 12:32.047
his "connection" with you
is special.

supposed to mean?

the t-shirt.

through old drafts,

12:46.530 --> 12:48.948
trying to find you
a break in act two.

12:48.999 --> 12:50.198
Hey, I recognize this.

12:50.217 --> 12:52.051
It's not
from Bombshell.

12:52.085 --> 12:53.385
It's from a musical
we were working on

12:53.420 --> 12:56.272
about, uh, Vegas
in the '60s.

12:56.306 --> 12:57.606
I played that
for you, remember?

12:57.640 --> 12:58.591
Of course I do.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.742
Why didn't you
finish it?

12:59.776 --> 13:01.093

other than that song...

13:01.127 --> 13:03.362
- It blew.
- Hey, I loved it.

after I heard it,

13:05.015 --> 13:06.715

my nat king Cole,

I'd get a chance to perform it.

19:06.476 --> 19:08.177
Well, I've got five
led screens

19:08.211 --> 19:10.513
arriving this morning.

19:10.547 --> 19:11.947
They're all donated.

19:11.982 --> 19:13.315
Contrary
to popular opinion,

19:13.350 --> 19:15.201
I've got some friends
in this business.

19:15.235 --> 19:17.086
Look, it'll
be a Broadway show

19:17.120 --> 19:18.821
with an off-Broadway budget.

19:18.839 --> 19:20.473
Oh, come on,
at least let me show you

19:20.507 --> 19:24.193
what I'm thinking.

19:24.227 --> 19:26.361
It's a little vague right now, but
picture red, white, and blue...

19:26.379 --> 19:27.746
Where's our Marilyn?

19:27.798 --> 19:30.032
I thought we were doing
Mr. and Mrs. Smith today.

19:30.050 --> 19:32.935
We switched up the schedule
a little bit at the last minute.

19:32.969 --> 19:34.186
Well, no one told me.

19:34.221 --> 19:36.071
I have Richard Francis
from the New York Times

19:36.106 --> 19:38.407
meeting me here
to see Ivy today.

19:38.425 --> 19:39.525
I gave her
the morning off

19:39.559 --> 19:41.644
so we could
play around with something.

19:41.678 --> 19:43.829
There's a potential new number
I want to show you,

19:43.864 --> 19:45.504
something I think
the show's been missing.

19:45.549 --> 19:47.500
I cannot believe
that you would do this

19:47.534 --> 19:48.717
without my approval.

19:48.735 --> 19:52.188
You're going
to love Tom's Bombshell.

19:52.222 --> 19:54.206
It's a much more
elegant take...

19:54.241 --> 19:56.091
Well, you call in Ivy
right now!

19:56.126 --> 19:58.310
- Why don't we wait outside?
- Great idea.

19:58.361 --> 20:00.362
Eileen... Hold on. Not until
I show it to you first.

20:00.396 --> 20:01.831
A disagreement
in front

20:01.865 --> 20:05.067
of the most important
arts editor in town?

20:05.101 --> 20:06.501
Great reboot, guys.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.404
- Richard Francis is here?
- Yes.

20:08.438 --> 20:09.822
Tell him
I'll be right out.

20:09.873 --> 20:12.041
Keep him cool.

20:12.075 --> 20:13.976
Can you please
just look at the song?

20:14.010 --> 20:17.029
The show is about
Marilyn, not J.F.K.

20:17.063 --> 20:18.948
I can't have two songs
about him.

20:18.982 --> 20:20.366
I agree.

20:20.417 --> 20:21.901
And Our little secret
is the one

20:21.935 --> 20:23.802
that's actually
about Marilyn.

20:23.837 --> 20:27.373
You're the director.
You decide.

20:27.407 --> 20:29.542
And this time, maybe you'd like
to clue me in.

20:33.897 --> 20:36.632
We are not losing

20:36.650 --> 20:39.818
the Marilyn - J.F.K. number.

20:39.870 --> 20:43.038
It's relevant to the story
that we're trying to tell.

20:43.072 --> 20:47.693
This one is not.

20:47.744 --> 20:51.030
I know.

20:51.064 --> 20:52.181
[Sighs]

20:52.215 --> 20:54.350
Uhh!

20:54.384 --> 20:55.851
I promised Sam.

20:55.886 --> 20:58.487
That promise
isn't even 12 hours old.

20:58.521 --> 21:01.507
He'll understand.

21:01.541 --> 21:04.577
What about the hat?

21:04.611 --> 21:07.229
Too much Sammy,
not enough nat, right?

21:07.263 --> 21:09.081
You going
to tell him?

21:09.132 --> 21:13.001
Tell me what?

21:13.019 --> 21:14.887
We cannot
put the number in.

21:14.938 --> 21:18.157
That's...
That's not necessarily...

21:18.208 --> 21:19.842
Tom, I just
left my job.

21:19.876 --> 21:21.894
Tom.

21:21.928 --> 21:25.698
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

21:25.749 --> 21:29.752
Sam, um, we'll... we'll be back
in a little while.

21:29.786 --> 21:31.453
- Okay...
- Come on, let's go for a walk.

21:31.471 --> 21:35.908
- What?
- Just come on.

21:35.942 --> 21:38.410
I tried, but I think
he needs to hear it from you.

21:38.445 --> 21:40.446
Just show up at the audition.
Show him what you've got.

21:40.497 --> 21:42.230
No, I don't want
to piss off Derek

21:42.248 --> 21:44.383
and risk losing the part
I already have.

21:44.417 --> 21:45.968
You're not asking him
to give you the part,

21:46.002 --> 21:47.503
just a chance.

21:47.537 --> 21:49.037
No.
He already said no.

21:49.055 --> 21:50.222
I don't want
to push it.

21:50.256 --> 21:52.558
He pushes us.

21:52.609 --> 21:55.527
Okay, you'd be amazing.
We both know it.

21:55.562 --> 21:57.746
Come on,
fight for it.

21:57.781 --> 21:58.814
I still think
you have a shot.

21:58.832 --> 21:59.872
You want me
to grow a pair,

21:59.916 --> 22:01.750
how about you?

22:01.785 --> 22:03.953
I'll talk to Derek
if you talk to Jimmy.

22:03.987 --> 22:06.472
You really think
Derek is going to fold?

22:06.506 --> 22:09.191
Scott doesn't want
his bells and whistles, either.

22:09.225 --> 22:11.310
This theater is downtown.
It's not Broadway.

22:11.361 --> 22:12.695
You told Scott
about it?

22:12.729 --> 22:14.163
What choice
did I have?

22:14.197 --> 22:15.948
I'm not going
to let Derek beat me.

22:15.999 --> 22:16.999
"Beat you"?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.368
Why are you
making this so personal?

22:19.386 --> 22:21.503
Is this about Karen?

22:21.521 --> 22:24.490
Oh, my God.
It so is.

22:24.541 --> 22:28.310
Did something happen
between the two of you?

22:28.345 --> 22:30.879
You remember when you thought
Karen and Derek were dating?

22:30.914 --> 22:32.081
Yeah, well,
they weren't.

22:32.115 --> 22:33.915
But he wants them
to be.

22:33.933 --> 22:37.903
He told me last week
to stay away from her.

22:37.937 --> 22:41.740
Are you going to?

22:41.775 --> 22:45.127
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, buddy.

22:45.161 --> 22:47.362
Thanks for showing Scott
my presentation.

22:47.380 --> 22:50.499
Great news, he really
loves the LED screens.

22:50.533 --> 22:54.586
When you're ready, we'll be doing
Voice in a dream, all right?

23:01.861 --> 23:05.745
There's no new story here Eileen.
Producer and director at odds,

23:05.772 --> 23:07.573
the last minute changes...
It's all been said.

23:07.607 --> 23:09.341
Then say it
a new way!

23:09.376 --> 23:10.993
I mean,
I need the press, Richard.

23:11.027 --> 23:13.395
You could talk about how you
got your show back.

23:13.430 --> 23:15.231
Well, that might
be a very interesting story,

23:15.265 --> 23:16.682
but it
involves my daughter,

23:16.700 --> 23:18.834
and I'm not about to drag her
through this.

23:18.869 --> 23:20.769
That's too bad.

23:20.804 --> 23:22.238
Mother and daughter
banding together

23:22.272 --> 23:26.141
to save a show,
people eat that stuff up.

23:26.176 --> 23:29.945
They do, don't they?

23:29.996 --> 23:33.165
Thanks for your help,
Richard, very much.

23:33.199 --> 23:34.483
Where are you going?

23:34.517 --> 23:35.801
Keep your phone on.

23:35.835 --> 23:40.055
I'm going
to get you a new story.

23:40.090 --> 23:42.591
What are we doing
down here?

23:42.642 --> 23:44.193
Are we buying pot?

23:44.227 --> 23:47.012
I haven't done that
in years.

23:47.030 --> 23:49.248
I'm proud of you.

23:49.282 --> 23:51.617
The way you've stepped up
as director,

23:51.651 --> 23:52.851
executing your vision

23:52.886 --> 23:55.738
while making everyone feel
supported and heard,

23:55.772 --> 23:57.439
it's amazing.

23:57.474 --> 23:59.024
But...

23:59.058 --> 24:00.458
But a director needs
to be a leader,

24:00.493 --> 24:02.011
and a leader
makes hard decisions.

24:02.045 --> 24:03.929
And when it comes
to hard decisions,

24:03.964 --> 24:05.114
he's the best.

24:05.148 --> 24:07.116
No, no, no.
They're in the wrong order.

24:07.150 --> 24:08.217
Are you serious?

24:08.251 --> 24:11.237
All right,
back to the top.

24:17.844 --> 24:18.977
Oh, bloody hell!

24:18.995 --> 24:20.980
The files are too big
for the system.

24:21.014 --> 24:22.014
They keep crashing.

24:22.048 --> 24:23.065
This is ridiculous.

24:23.099 --> 24:25.317
It just needs
to get up and running.

24:25.352 --> 24:26.485
We have three weeks
to rehearse.

24:26.503 --> 24:27.452
Do you want
to spend the whole time

24:27.470 --> 24:28.470
rebooting a computer?

24:28.521 --> 24:29.755
What I don't want

24:29.789 --> 24:32.041
is to show some kid
simply walking across the stage

24:32.075 --> 24:33.292
for five minutes.

24:33.326 --> 24:35.627
It's "some kid"
walking across a stage

24:35.645 --> 24:37.296
to tell a girl
that he loves her.

24:37.330 --> 24:40.165
If we can't get an audience
to care about that on its own,

24:40.183 --> 24:42.484
one of us isn't very good
at his job.

24:42.535 --> 24:44.703
So, what, you're saying
I can't direct this show?

24:44.737 --> 24:47.356
No, I'm saying you hide
behind fancy screens

24:47.390 --> 24:49.108
and orchestras
and clothes

24:49.142 --> 24:53.045
because you have nothing else
up your sleeve.

24:53.063 --> 24:54.129
What do you think, Karen?
Do we need any of this?

24:54.164 --> 24:55.614
Oh, don't put her
in the middle.

24:55.648 --> 24:57.249
I didn't.
You did.

24:57.283 --> 24:58.250
Tell him
what you really think.

24:58.284 --> 24:59.902
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh...

25:01.821 --> 25:05.891
It's okay.
Go ahead.

25:05.925 --> 25:08.761
It's...

25:08.795 --> 25:10.713
Not right
for this show.

25:10.747 --> 25:13.682
I'm sorry, Derek.

25:16.469 --> 25:18.854
Pathetic,
the lot of you.

25:23.076 --> 25:26.078
Hope you
enjoyed the show.

25:31.351 --> 25:34.119
Scott?

25:34.137 --> 25:35.854
What are you
doing here?

25:35.889 --> 25:37.556
Well, you haven't been
returning my calls.

25:37.574 --> 25:39.425
I've been busy.

25:39.459 --> 25:42.544
Right.
Of course.

25:42.595 --> 25:45.097
Sorry.

25:45.131 --> 25:48.534
You're not still mad
about my play, are you?

25:48.568 --> 25:49.768
I-I thought maybe,

25:49.786 --> 25:52.705
and then I realized
that it was 15 years ago.

25:52.739 --> 25:55.207
And I'm sure you understood
that anyone in my position

25:55.241 --> 25:56.408
would have done
the same thing, and...

25:56.442 --> 25:58.794
I wouldn't have.

25:58.828 --> 26:00.596
It was Lincoln center.

26:00.630 --> 26:02.648
You were my friend.

26:02.682 --> 26:03.682
My friend
who promised me

26:03.700 --> 26:05.184
I could direct that play
at the vineyard.

26:05.218 --> 26:07.453
They offered me
Mike Nichols.

26:07.487 --> 26:09.021
What should I have done?

26:09.055 --> 26:10.406
You should have
said no.

26:10.457 --> 26:12.458
It launched my career.

26:12.492 --> 26:14.460
And almost ruined mine.

26:14.494 --> 26:16.578
I promised them that play,
and I lost my slot.

26:16.613 --> 26:17.863
I couldn't work
for a year.

26:17.897 --> 26:20.349
And when I could,
it wasn't in New York.

26:20.383 --> 26:22.267
You've had
a spectacular career.

26:22.301 --> 26:25.938
Yeah, and it took me 15 years
to get back here.

26:25.972 --> 26:27.172
So pardon me

26:27.207 --> 26:30.325
if yours isn't the first face
I want to see.

26:37.817 --> 26:39.318
The way you talked
to those actors in there...

26:39.352 --> 26:40.602
Oh, God, seriously?
This now?

26:40.637 --> 26:43.255
It was awesome.

26:43.289 --> 26:47.826
You really don't care
what they think of you, do you?

26:47.861 --> 26:49.261
No.

26:49.295 --> 26:50.996
How do you sleep
at night,

26:51.030 --> 26:55.084
knowing everybody
hates you?

26:55.118 --> 26:57.953
I'm seriously asking.

26:57.987 --> 27:01.873
Well... you realize
that having them respect you

27:01.891 --> 27:04.827
is more important
than having them like you.

27:07.447 --> 27:10.582
It's a lonely business,
Tom.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.569
You can't be friends
with them.

27:16.539 --> 27:17.739
I don't think
that's going to be a problem

27:17.791 --> 27:18.707
for you and Jimmy.

27:18.741 --> 27:21.360
[Laughs]

27:21.394 --> 27:25.647
That one is killing me.

27:25.682 --> 27:27.232
He's 24 years old,

27:27.267 --> 27:29.301
and he's telling me
how to do my job.

27:29.335 --> 27:31.537
[Laughs]

27:31.571 --> 27:32.737
Reminds me of you
at that age.

27:32.755 --> 27:35.774
Shut up.
I was not that bad.

27:35.809 --> 27:37.025
You were worse.

27:37.060 --> 27:39.394
Arrogant, stubborn,

27:39.446 --> 27:42.064
full of huge ideas
that nobody believed in but you.

27:42.098 --> 27:46.184
In the end,
you were right.

27:46.202 --> 27:49.838
Maybe that kid
is the same.

27:49.873 --> 27:52.074
Listen to him.

27:52.125 --> 27:54.126
He's not your enemy.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.534
[Sighs]

28:03.963 --> 28:06.416
Derek is kind of slice ball, isn't he?

28:06.445 --> 28:07.845
I don't get why Karen
hangs around him all the time.

28:08.543 --> 28:10.695
Who should she be
hanging around?

28:10.729 --> 28:11.879
Jimmy?

28:11.913 --> 28:13.881
No.
That is not what I meant.

28:13.915 --> 28:15.116
I didn't think so.

28:15.150 --> 28:17.635
We've all wanted things
we can't have.

28:17.669 --> 28:20.705
The trick is
to learn to let go

28:20.739 --> 28:23.357
and enjoy the things
that you can have.

28:26.144 --> 28:27.478
What's up?

28:29.748 --> 28:33.284
I started out
in theaters like this.

28:33.318 --> 28:37.755
Actually,
they were worse than this.

28:37.789 --> 28:39.540
They were the sort of theaters
where the audience used

28:39.574 --> 28:41.492
to walk across the stage
in the middle of the performance

28:41.510 --> 28:46.047
to go to the toilet.

28:46.098 --> 28:50.034
But I did some
of my best work in them.

28:50.052 --> 28:54.855
I was innovative
'cause I had to be.

28:54.890 --> 28:58.626
You know, I got bigger jobs,
