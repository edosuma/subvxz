he was under investigation.

00:54.133 --> 00:55.600
Republican politicians
and staffers

00:55.600 --> 00:57.200
were shot at by an idiot.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.066
There was a terrible verdict
in the Philando Castile trial,

01:00.066 --> 01:02.400
and no verdict at all
in the Bill Cosby one,

01:02.400 --> 01:04.367
a case which incidentally
supplied us

01:04.367 --> 01:07.367
with one of the single weirdest
moments of the year.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.900
- Tuesday night,
after 12 hours at the courthouse

01:09.900 --> 01:11.633
outside Philadelphia,

Shouting your character's
catchphrase

01:23.467 --> 01:26.133
while you're on trial
is a bizarre choice.

01:26.133 --> 01:29.033
If Renee Zellweger was
on trial for triple murder,

01:29.033 --> 01:30.433
it would be strange
for her to shout,

"You had me at hello!"

No, Renee, we had you

But--but tonight,
let's not talk about Cosby.

01:41.533 --> 01:43.633
Let's talk about a different
terrible bill:

01:43.633 --> 01:45.367
the American Health Care Act,

01:45.367 --> 01:47.700
an act which answers
the question,

01:47.700 --> 01:49.967
"What if a bus stop ad
for a personal injury lawyer

01:49.967 --> 01:52.200
was a health care policy?"

01:52.200 --> 01:54.567
It--this has been somewhat
buried by other news,

01:54.567 --> 01:56.767
but--but Senate Republicans
have been quietly working

01:56.767 --> 01:58.333
on a new version of the bill,

01:58.333 --> 01:59.900
a task complicated slightly

01:59.900 --> 02:02.033
by a surprising new critic.

02:02.033 --> 02:04.100
- We're just getting
the Associated Press saying that

02:04.100 --> 02:06.533
President Trump told
Republican senators

02:06.533 --> 02:10.633
behind closed doors that
the House bill is "mean."

02:10.633 --> 02:12.133
- Yes.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.934
The president called
the bill "mean,"

02:14.934 --> 02:17.367
and then he presumably
folded his arms,

02:17.367 --> 02:19.900
stamped on the ground, screamed
until he tuckered himself out,

02:19.900 --> 02:22.900
and fell asleep right there
on the floor.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.567
Nap it off, big guy.

02:24.567 --> 02:25.767
And you know what?

02:25.767 --> 02:27.200
That--that's a little
hard to hear

02:27.200 --> 02:30.100
coming from a man who celebrated
that mean bill's passage

02:30.100 --> 02:31.734
at a Rose Garden ceremony.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.500
But perhaps he knows
that this bill

02:33.500 --> 02:35.333
is incredibly unpopular.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.200
One analysis found it doesn't
enjoy a plurality of support

02:38.200 --> 02:40.333
in any state in the country,

02:40.333 --> 02:41.967
which is amazing.

02:41.967 --> 02:45.300
You can't get all 50 states
to agree on anything.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.266
You can only get 49 states

02:47.266 --> 02:49.500
to admit that Delaware sucks.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.633
And--and the holdout,
by the way: Minnesota.

02:52.633 --> 02:55.533
They're just too nice
to admit the obvious.

02:55.533 --> 02:57.633
And Republican senators

02:57.633 --> 02:58.800
say that their bill
will be gentler.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.667
But it is hard to know that,

03:00.667 --> 03:03.300
given that very few people
have seen it,

03:03.300 --> 03:04.800
and they're reportedly planning

03:04.800 --> 03:06.867
to bypass the Committee hearing
and markup process,

03:06.867 --> 03:09.867
vastly limiting the amount
of changes that can be made.

03:09.867 --> 03:12.133
And they also seem
strangely unprepared

03:12.133 --> 03:14.266

they've been getting.

03:14.266 --> 03:18.066

of Insurance Commissioners.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.000
- It comes down to--
the biggest problem we have

04:22.000 --> 04:24.266
right now is uncertainty.

04:24.266 --> 04:26.266
Insurance, I think everybody
at this table will agree--

04:26.266 --> 04:28.967
insurance hates uncertainty.

04:28.967 --> 04:31.033
- Yeah, of course
insurance companies

04:31.033 --> 04:32.533
don't like uncertainty.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.000

is even going to be.

seems oddly cavalier

I doubt has done a--
a day of hard labor in his life

07:12.900 --> 07:15.834
show how he thinks

I don't know what

07:54.900 --> 07:57.300
But Trump promising
to bring back coal jobs

07:57.300 --> 08:00.133
is undeniably potent, and to
listen to his EPA administrator,

08:00.133 --> 08:02.767
it's a promise that
he's already keeping.

08:02.767 --> 08:05.133
- Since the last--fourth quarter
of last year to--

08:05.133 --> 08:07.900
to most recently, added almost
50,000 jobs in the coal sector.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.800
In the month of May alone,
almost 7,000 jobs.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.734
- Okay, so the only
problem there

08:12.734 --> 08:15.066
is that those numbers
are bullshit.

08:15.066 --> 08:16.967
The Bureau of Labor Statistics

08:16.967 --> 08:18.734
says the actual number
of coal jobs created

08:18.734 --> 08:21.266
since last year
has been just 1,300.

08:21.266 --> 08:23.767
So that 50,000 new jobs claim

08:23.767 --> 08:26.700
was off by 48,700,

08:26.700 --> 08:28.033
which for this administration

08:28.033 --> 08:30.266
is actually
uncharacteristically accurate.

08:30.266 --> 08:33.066
I--I'd just assumed that
the figure would be more like

08:33.066 --> 08:35.767
12 mining jobs, and they're
not actually jobs,

08:35.767 --> 08:38.500
they're lobsters,
and Trump didn't create them.

08:38.500 --> 08:42.767
He just remembers 12 times in
his life that he saw a lobster.

08:42.767 --> 08:44.400
But look, there is no doubt

08:44.400 --> 08:46.667
Trump claims coal
is a huge priority

08:46.667 --> 08:48.834
for his White House,
and let's set aside tonight

08:48.834 --> 08:51.533
the fact that it is
environmentally catastrophic,

08:51.533 --> 08:53.333
which we shouldn't,
because it is.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.800
But this president clearly
doesn't care about that.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.300
He pulled out
of the Paris Agreement,

08:57.300 --> 08:58.600
citing coal as one
of the reasons.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.100
Uh, he's lifted a freeze
on new coal leases

09:01.100 --> 09:03.100
on public lands
and revoked a rule

09:03.100 --> 09:04.467
to limit coal mining companies

09:04.467 --> 09:06.100
from dumping debris
into local streams,

09:06.100 --> 09:08.500
with miners behind him
both times.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.166
So if coal jobs are
so important to him,

09:11.166 --> 09:12.633
let's talk about them.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.533
And let's begin with a number,

09:14.533 --> 09:17.166
because it's smaller
than you might think.

09:17.166 --> 09:18.867
- While President Trump
has talked about

09:18.867 --> 09:20.700
reviving the coal industry,

09:20.700 --> 09:23.200
which employs 76,000 people,

09:23.200 --> 09:26.200
retailer JCPenney,
on the verge of bankruptcy,

09:26.200 --> 09:29.133
employs 114,000 alone.

09:29.133 --> 09:32.033
- Wow, so there's a lot
that is surprising there.

09:32.033 --> 09:34.333
For a start, I didn't even know
that JCPenney

09:34.333 --> 09:36.667
had employees anymore.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.033
I thought anyone who walked
into a JCPenney

09:39.033 --> 09:40.734
was just handed the keys
to the store,

09:40.734 --> 09:42.800
saying, "Here, see if you
can make it work.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.300
Good luck."

09:44.300 --> 09:47.667
But 76,000 coal workers is less
than you'd expect,

09:47.667 --> 09:49.867
although in the areas where
they are concentrated,

09:49.867 --> 09:52.467
coal mines are central
to the community.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.967
Uh, some schools have miners as
mascots for their sports teams.

09:55.967 --> 09:59.033
Or even--or even they have
coal industry-sponsored fairs,

09:59.033 --> 10:01.166
where kids make a variety
of projects,

10:01.166 --> 10:04.266
perhaps none as awesome
as this one.

10:04.266 --> 10:07.800
- It's about a lump of coal
named Lumpy

10:07.800 --> 10:10.934
who's on a journey to figure out
what he--

10:10.934 --> 10:13.133
what he's gonna be
and what he could be

10:13.133 --> 10:16.166
when he "grows up."

10:16.166 --> 10:17.333
[laughter]

10:17.333 --> 10:18.834
- I love that kid.

10:18.834 --> 10:22.000
And by the way, top-notch use
of air quotes there,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.133
because you and I know
both know, kid,

10:24.133 --> 10:26.600
that Lumpy is not going
to "grow up."

10:26.600 --> 10:29.166
Lumpy is going to live
a short life underground

10:29.166 --> 10:32.000
until one fateful day
his friends notice he's missing.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.533
"Where's Lumpy?" they'll say.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.567
"Has anyone seen Lumpy?"

10:35.567 --> 10:38.233
They'll form search parties
and put posters up around town,

10:38.233 --> 10:40.700
but in the back of their minds,
they know the truth.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.200
They've always known.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.667
And one day
there's a knock at the door.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.133
It's the news they've all
been dreading all along.

10:46.133 --> 10:49.200
Lumpy has been burned to death
in a horrifying ritual

10:49.200 --> 10:51.367
alongside the entire
Lump family.

10:51.367 --> 10:53.233
This is why we don't name them,

10:53.233 --> 10:55.533
because then we get attached!

10:55.533 --> 10:58.533
[laughter]

10:58.533 --> 11:01.266
Anyway, the point is,
when coal jobs go away,

11:01.266 --> 11:02.967
communities feel it,

11:02.967 --> 11:05.300
especially because these
jobs are high-paying.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.033
A coal miner can make upwards
of $80,000,

11:08.033 --> 11:10.100
so that's not easy to replace.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.367
And the industry itself
points much of the blame

11:12.367 --> 11:14.233
for lost jobs
at President Obama,

11:14.233 --> 11:17.333
with one of the loudest voices
being this guy.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.133
- These are my employees.

11:19.133 --> 11:20.734
I care for them deeply.

11:20.734 --> 11:23.133
Berrick Obama and his
Democrat followers

11:23.133 --> 11:25.500
are destroying entire
segments of America.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.233
Mr. Obama is an outlaw.

11:27.233 --> 11:29.066
I pray every day

11:29.066 --> 11:30.867
that this man's incompetence

11:30.867 --> 11:32.367
will be overcome...

11:32.367 --> 11:35.967
that his evil agenda
will be overcome.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.633
When you have a 52-year-old
coal miner

11:38.633 --> 11:40.867
in your office crying

11:40.867 --> 11:42.367
because you were forced
to lay him off,

11:42.367 --> 11:44.200
that's what Obama has never seen

11:44.200 --> 11:46.333
because he's never had a job.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.767
- What...

11:47.767 --> 11:49.467
are you talking about?

11:49.467 --> 11:52.066
He had a job.
Listen to yourself.

11:52.066 --> 11:54.900
His job was destroying entire
segments of America

11:54.900 --> 11:56.433
with his evil incompetence,

11:56.433 --> 11:59.834
or his name was not
Berrick Obama.

11:59.834 --> 12:02.166
Now, now that--that man
was Bob Murray,

12:02.166 --> 12:03.500
the CEO of Murray Energy,

12:03.500 --> 12:04.867
and we will get to him later.

12:04.867 --> 12:07.133
But his--his claim that
Obama's regulations

12:07.133 --> 12:09.667
have been job-killers is worth
taking a look at,

12:09.667 --> 12:11.233
because while coal mining jobs

12:11.233 --> 12:13.433
undoubtedly did decline
under Obama,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.300
it's worth noting that
coal mining jobs

12:15.300 --> 12:17.533
have also been declining
for decades.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.667
I mean, just look
at that trend line.

12:19.667 --> 12:22.200
Coal industry jobs declined
at roughly the same rate

12:22.200 --> 12:24.367
as careers in
the zeppelin industry

12:24.367 --> 12:26.734
and babies named Adolf.

12:26.734 --> 12:29.066
Oh, some still exist,

12:29.066 --> 12:32.667
there's just not nearly as many
of them anymore.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.834
And--and I'm not saying
Obama's regulations

12:34.834 --> 12:37.867
had no effect,
but researchers have found

12:37.867 --> 12:41.000
that they had very little impact
relative to other factors.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.400
When they studied the decline
in expected demand for coal

12:43.400 --> 12:46.300
from a decade ago, they found
that nearly half of that drop

12:46.300 --> 12:49.233
was owing to the drop
in natural gas prices,

12:49.233 --> 12:53.166
and another 18% was due to
the growth in renewable energy

12:53.166 --> 12:54.500
like wind and solar.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.667
And there is perhaps
no more dramatic evidence

12:56.667 --> 13:00.133
of coal losing out
to solar energy than this.

13:00.133 --> 13:03.433
- Work has begun to power
the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum

13:03.433 --> 13:05.734
not by coal, but by the sun.

13:05.734 --> 13:07.767
- We believe that this project
will help save

13:07.767 --> 13:11.066
at least $8,000 to $10,000
off of the energy costs

13:11.066 --> 13:12.367
on this building alone.

13:12.367 --> 13:13.400
- It's true.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.433
The Kentucky Coal Mining Museum

13:15.433 --> 13:18.033
is now using solar energy.

13:18.033 --> 13:20.166
It's like finding out
the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame

13:20.166 --> 13:22.200
was brought to you
by Smash Mouth.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.567
[laughter]

13:23.567 --> 13:25.700
And--and the hard truth is,

13:25.700 --> 13:27.633
even if consumption
wasn't declining,

13:27.633 --> 13:29.900
companies would still
be cutting jobs,

13:29.900 --> 13:33.367
as they are increasingly
replacing miners with machines.

13:33.367 --> 13:35.800
- You had all this
mechanization going on

13:35.800 --> 13:36.900
and people leaving,

13:36.900 --> 13:39.233
but it's come
the point now

13:39.233 --> 13:41.934
where they don't do
underground mining

13:41.934 --> 13:43.367
if they can get
away with it.

13:43.367 --> 13:46.166
They do mountaintop removals
and surface mining.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.033
You can mine a whole
mountainside,

13:48.033 --> 13:50.333
and I'm talking about
a whole mountainside,

13:50.333 --> 13:51.633
within a year or two

13:51.633 --> 13:54.734
with around, uh,
7 to 12 people,

13:54.734 --> 13:57.467
and you--
that's all you need.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.767
- He's right.

13:58.767 --> 14:00.767
Coal mining,
like almost all industries,

14:00.767 --> 14:02.767
is facing increased automation.

14:02.767 --> 14:05.600
And I say that well aware
that in five to ten years,

14:05.600 --> 14:06.900
I am probably going
to be replaced

14:06.900 --> 14:08.667
by a robotic English
tea kettle

14:08.667 --> 14:11.433
that screams depressing
money stats at you.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.767
And look, the rise
of alternative energies

14:13.767 --> 14:16.233
is a good thing for
the Earth as a whole.

14:16.233 --> 14:18.300
And some point out that
as coal jobs go away,

14:18.300 --> 14:20.433
new green jobs are opening up,

14:20.433 --> 14:24.233
which is true,
but not where coal miners live.

14:24.233 --> 14:26.500
West Virginia and Kentucky,
for instance,

14:26.500 --> 14:29.500
rank near the bottom
in solar jobs per capita.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.667
So for the people
who've faced layoffs,

14:31.667 --> 14:33.600
the future can look bleak.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.834
- It gets really
depressing whenever you--

14:35.834 --> 14:37.433
you know, you have kids,

14:37.433 --> 14:39.166
and you go to work
one day and they say,

14:39.166 --> 14:41.066
"Well, you don't
work here anymore."

14:41.066 --> 14:42.867
And you got to go home and...

14:46.567 --> 14:49.000
Face your family and say
you don't have a job no more.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.633
- Yeah, and that is devastating.

14:51.633 --> 14:53.200
And I know that it does not help

14:53.200 --> 14:56.333
someone in his situation to be
told statistics by someone

14:56.333 --> 14:58.300
like me in a TV studio,

14:58.300 --> 14:59.900
possibly powered by coal,

14:59.900 --> 15:03.166
who doesn't have the skills
or muscle mass to be a miner,

15:03.166 --> 15:05.600
and who looks like the results
of a drunk threesome

15:05.600 --> 15:08.767
between Chris Hayes,
Austin Powers, and a potato.

15:08.767 --> 15:10.467
But--I know that,

15:10.467 --> 15:12.000
but the question is,

15:12.000 --> 15:15.066
what does help someone
in that situation?

15:15.066 --> 15:17.600
Donald Trump insists
that he's helping miners

15:17.600 --> 15:19.967
by reducing regulations
on coal companies.

15:19.967 --> 15:21.900
But too often, people conflate

15:21.900 --> 15:24.500
coal, coal miners,
and coal companies,

15:24.500 --> 15:26.166
and imply that when
you help one,

15:26.166 --> 15:27.734
you help them all.

15:27.734 --> 15:30.100
But they are not all
in the same boat,

15:30.100 --> 15:32.066
although they may
insist otherwise.

15:32.066 --> 15:35.266
For instance, when the coal
company Alpha Natural Resources

15:35.266 --> 15:37.033
filed for bankruptcy
two years ago,

15:37.033 --> 15:40.233
their CEO stressed
how painful that was.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.900
- Are more mine
closures possible?

15:42.900 --> 15:45.000
- They are, unfortunately.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.734
- And for Crutchfield,
that's clearly

15:46.734 --> 15:48.500
the hardest part of it all.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.867
When I asked him about this
photo displayed prominently

15:51.867 --> 15:53.066
at Alpha headquarters,

15:53.066 --> 15:55.367
a photo called "Daddy's Hands,"

15:55.367 --> 15:57.667
emotions were hard to hold back.

15:57.667 --> 16:00.600
- That is the backbone
of America,

16:00.600 --> 16:03.500
and we have that photograph
just to remind everybody

16:03.500 --> 16:04.900
who we serve.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.500
- That's a nice sentiment,

16:06.500 --> 16:09.500
just slightly undercut
by the fact that

16:09.500 --> 16:10.734
according to court documents,

16:10.734 --> 16:13.166
Alpha later asked
its bankruptcy trustee

16:13.166 --> 16:15.433
if it could save $3 million

16:15.433 --> 16:17.767
by terminating the health
and life insurance benefits

16:17.767 --> 16:19.533
of around 1,200 retirees,

16:19.533 --> 16:22.200
while at the same time
seeking permission to pay

16:22.200 --> 16:26.200
bonuses totaling up to around
$12 million to top executives,

16:26.200 --> 16:28.900
including that guy
that you just saw,

16:28.900 --> 16:31.700
which is the sort of thing
that might make Daddy's hands

16:31.700 --> 16:33.767
want to do something like this.

16:33.767 --> 16:37.700
And you wouldn't really
blame them for that.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.700
And yet, coal CEOs
constantly claim to workers

16:40.700 --> 16:42.700
that it's us against them.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.934
Take Don Blankenship,
ex-CEO of Massey Energy.

16:45.934 --> 16:48.133
He once held a rally
featuring Ted Nugent,

16:48.133 --> 16:49.667
Hank Williams, Jr.,

16:49.667 --> 16:51.967
and a rousing speech
from Blankenship himself.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.400
- I know that the safety
and health of coal miners

16:54.400 --> 16:56.333
is my most important job.

16:56.333 --> 16:59.400
I don't need Washington
politicians to tell me that

16:59.400 --> 17:01.400
and neither do you.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.133
[cheers and applause]

17:04.133 --> 17:06.266
- Okay, so, speech aside,

17:06.266 --> 17:09.233
that's a hell of a look.

17:09.233 --> 17:12.333
It takes a brave man to go for
half Kerri Strug

17:12.333 --> 17:15.700
and half the "Time to make
the doughnuts" guy.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.400
And--and if you thought--

17:17.400 --> 17:18.700
if you thought
the presence of a man

17:18.700 --> 17:21.133
who's just been ejaculated on
by a flag

17:21.133 --> 17:23.867
was as upsetting as
that rally could get,

17:23.867 --> 17:26.300
well, guess who else was there.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.900
- We believe in God, right?

17:27.900 --> 17:30.533
all: Yeah!
- Faith, family?

17:30.533 --> 17:31.967
Country?

17:31.967 --> 17:35.800
We believe America's
a shining city on a hill, right?

17:35.800 --> 17:37.200
- Freedom!
- We believe in freedom.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.266
How you doin', doc?

17:38.266 --> 17:40.200
By the way, there's a--

17:40.200 --> 17:42.467
there's a really hot-looking
chick in the third row there.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.266
How you doing, baby?

17:44.266 --> 17:46.834
I'll take you backstage
to meet Hank a little later,

17:46.834 --> 17:48.233
if you want.

17:48.233 --> 17:51.633
You want to meet me later?

17:51.633 --> 17:54.300
- What the fuck was that?

17:54.300 --> 17:55.600
In the course of his speech,

17:55.600 --> 17:57.800
he referenced God,
quoted Reagan,

17:57.800 --> 17:59.567
and engaged in
sexual harassment.

17:59.567 --> 18:02.266
That man really is Fox News.

18:02.266 --> 18:03.567
[laughter]

18:03.567 --> 18:06.734
But--but notably--notably,

18:06.734 --> 18:09.734
just a few months after
his rally against

18:09.734 --> 18:11.066
Washington's safety rules,

18:11.066 --> 18:13.133
Blankenship's company had
a massive explosion,

18:13.133 --> 18:14.867
killing 29 miners.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.967
And Blankenship
denies responsibility.

18:16.967 --> 18:19.567
But in the wake
of that disaster,

18:19.567 --> 18:21.600
he was sentenced
to a year in prison

18:21.600 --> 18:24.934
for conspiring to violate mine
safety and health standards.

18:24.934 --> 18:26.333
He actually just got out,

18:26.333 --> 18:28.166
and now has to rebuild his life

18:28.166 --> 18:29.834
with absolutely nothing

18:29.834 --> 18:31.967
but his estimated
golden parachute

18:31.967 --> 18:34.500
of $86 million.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.867
And that will help you
get back on your feet.

18:36.867 --> 18:40.467
86 million will help you get
back on anyone's feet.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.333
You want to get back
on Fred Astaire's feet?

18:42.333 --> 18:43.500
That's no problem.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.800
For $86 million,

18:44.800 --> 18:45.900
grab a hacksaw.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.367
We are digging up Fred.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.934
Blankenship is already lobbying
the Trump administration

18:50.934 --> 18:53.967
to oppose more onerous
criminal laws for mine owners,

18:53.967 --> 18:56.533
saying they "will not improve
mine safety."

18:56.533 --> 18:57.734
And I would like to think

18:57.734 --> 18:59.667
that Trump would not
listen to him,

18:59.667 --> 19:02.600
because, you know,
he loves the miners so much.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.934
But there's not much
evidence of that.

19:04.934 --> 19:06.700
What there is evidence of

19:06.700 --> 19:09.000
is his affection for mine CEOs.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.867
His Secretary of Commerce
is Wilbur Ross,

19:10.867 --> 19:13.967
who ran the company that had
the deadly Sago mine disaster.

19:13.967 --> 19:16.133
And he's also close to that man
that you saw earlier,

19:16.133 --> 19:18.400
Bob Murray, who claims
that Trump called him

19:18.400 --> 19:22.066
shortly after the election,
to deliver a special message.

19:22.066 --> 19:25.233
- He said,
"Tell your coal miners

19:25.233 --> 19:28.166
I've got their back."

19:28.166 --> 19:29.734
And then he said,

19:29.734 --> 19:31.000
"I love you, man."

19:31.000 --> 19:35.200
- Well, congratulations
on that, Bob.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.300
You're now in the very select
group of people

19:37.300 --> 19:39.333
that Donald Trump has said
"I love you" to,

19:39.333 --> 19:42.100
along with presumably
the worst Baldwin,

19:42.100 --> 19:44.500
exactly one of his
two daughters,

19:44.500 --> 19:46.300
and the hollow-eyed
business ghost

19:46.300 --> 19:48.834
that greets him in the mirror
every morning.

19:48.834 --> 19:52.233
And Murray actually illustrates
the divide that can exist

19:52.233 --> 19:54.333
between a coal company's
interests and those

19:54.333 --> 19:55.667
of its workers.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.667
And I'm going to need
to be careful here,

19:57.667 --> 20:00.367
because when we contacted
Murray Energy for this piece,

20:00.367 --> 20:01.867
they sent us a letter
instructing us

20:01.867 --> 20:05.433
to "cease and desist from any
effort to defame, harass,

20:05.433 --> 20:08.233
or otherwise injure Mr. Murray
or Murray Energy,"

20:08.233 --> 20:11.100
and telling us that
"failure to do so will result

20:11.100 --> 20:12.900
in immediate litigation."

20:12.900 --> 20:14.533
And a cease-and-desist letter

20:14.533 --> 20:16.934
is, incredibly, something that
we've never received before

20:16.934 --> 20:18.233
on this show.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.066
Not even the nation
of New Zealand

20:20.066 --> 20:21.367
has sent us one,

20:21.367 --> 20:23.900
and we wallaby-kick those
"Eeminem" burglars

20:23.900 --> 20:27.700
in the balls almost every week.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.500
So--so I have to proceed
with caution.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.333
I'm not going to say,
for instance,

20:32.333 --> 20:34.800
that Bob Murray looks like
a geriatric Dr. Evil,

20:34.800 --> 20:38.400
even though--even though
he clearly does,

20:38.400 --> 20:41.667
because Murray Energy has
sued people in the past.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.367
Just last month,
they sued "The New York Times"

20:44.367 --> 20:46.233
for libel, and they also sued

20:46.233 --> 20:48.133
everyone from a contributor
to "The Huffington Post"

20:48.133 --> 20:50.266
to these two papers in Ohio.

20:50.266 --> 20:52.166
In fact, Murray's current
general counsel

20:52.166 --> 20:53.767
told reporters that this paper

20:53.767 --> 20:55.800
had inflicted a potential
economic loss

20:55.800 --> 20:57.333
of, and I am not
making this up,

20:57.333 --> 21:00.066
$1 billion,

21:00.066 --> 21:01.600
which,
when you think about it,

21:01.600 --> 21:04.934
is exactly what you'd expect
from a geriatric Dr. Evil.

21:04.934 --> 21:08.266
And though Murray Energy have
insisted in the past

21:08.266 --> 21:10.066
that they only sue news outlets

21:10.066 --> 21:11.834
as a matter of "last resort"

21:11.834 --> 21:13.900
and "never to chill
free speech,"

21:13.900 --> 21:15.266
their letter also tells us

21:15.266 --> 21:17.000
that they might
"pursue our damages

21:17.000 --> 21:18.567
"to the fullest extent
of the law,

21:18.567 --> 21:20.767
"including to the level
of the Supreme Court

21:20.767 --> 21:22.200
of the United States."

21:22.200 --> 21:24.700
And that would actually
be a real mistake,

21:24.700 --> 21:28.066
because we have a personal
relationship with those judges.

21:28.066 --> 21:29.700
And I'll give you a fun fact.

21:29.700 --> 21:32.300
If you scratch Justice Alito
just behind his left ear,

21:32.300 --> 21:33.967
he pees on the floor.

21:33.967 --> 21:35.166
That's true.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.600
That's true of the dog
and the man.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.166
So--so as we have been
explicitly told

21:40.166 --> 21:42.233
to "cease and desist,"

21:42.233 --> 21:44.934
let us do neither
of those things,

21:44.934 --> 21:47.100
and let's talk about Bob Murray.

21:47.100 --> 21:50.400
Because he--he often speaks

21:50.400 --> 21:53.000
on TV in defense
of coal workers,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.033
but let's take a look
at his actions, shall we?

21:56.033 --> 21:58.133
Because Murray's company
recently unsuccessfully

21:58.133 --> 21:59.400
sued to block a rule

21:59.400 --> 22:00.934
aimed at reducing
miners' exposure

22:00.934 --> 22:03.266
to coal dust that
causes black lung,

22:03.266 --> 22:06.767
a disease which killed
as many as 10,000 people

22:06.767 --> 22:09.266
between 1995 and 2005.

22:09.266 --> 22:12.233
Murray insisted that the rule
was illegal, destructive,

22:12.233 --> 22:13.934
and did nothing for miners,

22:13.934 --> 22:15.333
uh--nothing for their health,

22:15.333 --> 22:17.767
although last year, uh,
with the rule in effect,

22:17.767 --> 22:20.800
government reports indicated
respirable dust levels

22:20.800 --> 22:22.333
fell to historic lows.

22:22.333 --> 22:24.133
And look, if you even appear

22:24.133 --> 22:26.633
to be on the same side
as black lung,

22:26.633 --> 22:29.433
you're on the wrong
fucking side.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.166
That's the equivalent
of watching "My Girl"

22:31.166 --> 22:32.767
and rooting for the bees.

22:32.767 --> 22:36.600
And--and some of--
some of Murray's employees

22:36.600 --> 22:38.667
have clashed with the company
over safety.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.834
A few years back,
Murray proposed a program

22:40.834 --> 22:43.333
where miners could receive
bonuses based on the amount

22:43.333 --> 22:44.900
of coal they extracted.

22:44.900 --> 22:47.867
It was voted down by employees
who believed it would have

22:47.867 --> 22:50.667
"an adverse impact on safety
in the mines."

22:50.667 --> 22:52.600
But the company did it anyway,

22:52.600 --> 22:54.066
saying if workers
didn't like it,

22:54.066 --> 22:56.834
they could just "write 'void'
on their checks."

22:56.834 --> 23:00.600
And amazingly, around
62 employees did just that,

23:00.600 --> 23:02.333
with two going even further,

23:02.333 --> 23:07.000
one returning a check for $11.58
by writing "Kiss my ass, Bob"

23:07.000 --> 23:09.900
on it and another taking a check

23:09.900 --> 23:13.233
for $3.22 and writing,
"Eat shit, Bob."

23:13.233 --> 23:17.133
And--I have to say,
well-played, miners,

23:17.133 --> 23:19.500
because you could have sent
that message on a cake,

23:19.500 --> 23:21.133
or you could have
sent it on a bear

23:21.133 --> 23:22.467
with a big stuffed heart,

23:22.467 --> 23:26.000
but to write it
on your $3 bonus check?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.633
Well-played to you, sirs.

23:28.633 --> 23:30.667
And then there was
the deadly collapse

23:30.667 --> 23:32.633
at the Crandall Canyon Mine
in Utah.

23:32.633 --> 23:34.233
Murray attracted attention

23:34.233 --> 23:35.934
for a bizarre press conference

23:35.934 --> 23:39.200
in which, while rescuers were
still working, he was making

23:39.200 --> 23:42.166
bold claims about the cause
of the accident.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.200
- This is the first
major accident I've ever had

23:44.200 --> 23:45.433
in one of my coal mines.

23:45.433 --> 23:48.166
In 20 years of being
in existence,

23:48.166 --> 23:50.500
the first major accident.

23:52.533 --> 23:55.934
And this was caused
by an earthquake.

23:55.934 --> 23:59.433
Not something that
Murray Energy

23:59.433 --> 24:01.400
or Utah American did
or our employees did

24:01.400 --> 24:03.100
or our management did.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.834
- So here is the interesting
thing about that.

24:05.834 --> 24:08.567
To this day, Murray says
that the evidence proves

24:08.567 --> 24:10.367
he was correct that
an earthquake

24:10.367 --> 24:11.667
caused the collapse.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.800
But that was decidedly
not the conclusion

24:13.800 --> 24:15.367
of the government's
investigation,

24:15.367 --> 24:16.800
which found it was caused by

24:16.800 --> 24:18.600
"unauthorized mining practices,"

24:18.600 --> 24:22.000
and there was "no evidence that
a naturally occurring earthquake

24:22.000 --> 24:23.400
caused the collapse."

24:23.400 --> 24:26.033
Murray does not want us talking

24:26.033 --> 24:28.533
about the accident, saying
it was "an incredibly difficult

24:28.533 --> 24:29.867
time for the families."

24:29.867 --> 24:31.467
And though he admits
that he "was unable

24:31.467 --> 24:34.266
to satisfy the expectations
of the family members,"

24:34.266 --> 24:36.967
he says he showed them
"honestly, sincerity,

24:36.967 --> 24:38.533
and compassion"
throughout the crisis.

24:38.533 --> 24:42.000
Although, according to both
a Department of Labor

24:42.000 --> 24:44.767
investigation and Congressional
testimony by some of them,

24:44.767 --> 24:47.600
their pain was exacerbated
by Murray's behavior

24:47.600 --> 24:50.900
while they waited
for news of their loved ones.

24:50.900 --> 24:54.333
- All we heard was
earthquake, earthquake.

24:54.333 --> 24:56.266
We did not want to hear
about earthquakes,

24:56.266 --> 24:57.700
but wanted to know

24:57.700 --> 25:01.667
when we were going to see
our loved ones again.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.867
Murray more than once
yelled at us

25:03.867 --> 25:06.200
when we asked questions.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.400
- Wow.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.500
Yelling at distraught families

25:09.500 --> 25:12.100
when they ask questions
is not okay.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.934
It is barely okay to do it
with five-year-olds,

25:14.934 --> 25:18.533
and they ask over 42 million
questions a day.

25:18.533 --> 25:19.667
"I give up!

25:19.667 --> 25:22.066
"'Why are birds?' is not
a question

25:22.066 --> 25:24.700
"I know the fucking answer to,
Kyler!

25:24.700 --> 25:29.934
Google it! Google it!
Google it!"

25:33.633 --> 25:35.834
And there is one more
Bob story--

25:35.834 --> 25:38.467
Bob Murray story that I would
like you to know about.

25:38.467 --> 25:40.300
It's an apocryphal tale

25:40.300 --> 25:41.834
concerning how
the company began.

25:41.834 --> 25:44.600
Union miners claim that
Murray used to tell them

25:44.600 --> 25:46.867
that he "was sitting
on his back porch,

25:46.867 --> 25:48.367
"contemplating his future,

25:48.367 --> 25:50.233
"when he was approached
by a squirrel"

25:50.233 --> 25:52.066
who "hopped up next to him,

25:52.066 --> 25:53.633
"looked him in the eye,
and said,

25:53.633 --> 25:58.200
"'Bob Murray, you should be
operating your very own mines'."

25:58.200 --> 26:00.166
And we asked Murray's company
about that story,

26:00.166 --> 26:02.400
and they told us,
"It never occurred."

26:02.400 --> 26:03.600
And you know what?

26:03.600 --> 26:06.300
I actually believe Murray
on that one,

26:06.300 --> 26:07.734
'cause I think deep down
we all know

26:07.734 --> 26:09.600
if squirrels could talk,
they wouldn't be giving

26:09.600 --> 26:11.500
career advice
to coal executives.

26:11.500 --> 26:14.033
They'd be loudly listing
their favorite nuts.

26:14.033 --> 26:16.433
"Okay, let's go--
acorns, chestnuts,

26:16.433 --> 26:18.767
"walnuts, almonds--
cashews are good,

26:18.767 --> 26:20.133
"although, of course,
technically not a nut.

26:20.133 --> 26:21.600
"Brazil nuts, not my favorite,

26:21.600 --> 26:23.200
"but I wouldn't kick 'em
out of bed either,

26:23.200 --> 26:24.967
"do you feel me, guys?

26:24.967 --> 26:27.266
Do you feel this?"

26:27.266 --> 26:29.533
And look, to get back to jobs,

26:29.533 --> 26:32.233
Murray argues that he has
provided thousands of them

26:32.233 --> 26:34.166
to mining communities,
and he's right about that.

26:34.166 --> 26:36.567
And for those communities,
that fact might

26:36.567 --> 26:39.133
understandably outweigh
everything else,

26:39.133 --> 26:42.433
especially if Murray and Trump
can bring coal back.

26:42.433 --> 26:44.767
But notably, even Murray himself

26:44.767 --> 26:46.934
is careful regarding that.

26:46.934 --> 26:48.133
- Can those jobs come back

26:48.133 --> 26:49.767
if it's a Donald Trump
presidency?

26:49.767 --> 26:51.066
- I don't think those jobs

26:51.066 --> 26:52.166
can come back, ma'am.

26:52.166 --> 26:54.166
But we can stop the destruction.

26:54.166 --> 26:56.400
I don't think it can
come back to where it was,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.967
but we can stop it, and that's
what I've told Mr. Trump.

26:58.967 --> 27:00.600
And he gets it.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.166
- Uh, hang on there, Bob.

27:02.166 --> 27:03.800
No, he doesn't.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.934
He doesn't--

27:04.934 --> 27:07.734
A, he barely gets
what mining is.

27:07.734 --> 27:08.934
He may well think it's just

27:08.934 --> 27:10.467
running up to things
that he wants

27:10.467 --> 27:12.500
and yelling, "Mine!"

27:12.500 --> 27:14.700
And--that--that's possible.

27:14.700 --> 27:19.500
And--and B, B,
he's repeatedly told miners

27:19.500 --> 27:21.533
that they're going to be
working their asses off.

27:21.533 --> 27:24.367
If Trump really cares
about miners,

27:24.367 --> 27:26.867
he would be putting a plan
in place for their futures

27:26.867 --> 27:29.166
as mining continues
its long-term decline.

27:29.166 --> 27:31.000
But he isn't doing that.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.867
Now--now, luckily, there are
some small things being done

27:33.867 --> 27:35.000
by others.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.200
One company called Bit Source

27:36.200 --> 27:37.934
in Kentucky has been
hiring miners

27:37.934 --> 27:40.133
as software programmers
and paying them

27:40.133 --> 27:41.900
through their retraining.

27:41.900 --> 27:43.667
- I've learned numerous
coding languages.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.166
I've learned CSS.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.333
I've learned PHP, HTML,

27:47.333 --> 27:50.800
JavaScript, Twig, and YAML.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.066
- That's really impressive--

27:52.066 --> 27:53.900
so much so that I will
ignore the fact

27:53.900 --> 27:55.500
that Twig and YAML sounds like

27:55.500 --> 27:57.000
a bootleg Russian DVD knockoff

27:57.000 --> 27:58.500
of "Lilo & Stitch."

27:58.500 --> 28:00.133
[laughter]

28:00.133 --> 28:03.066
And--but look, that--
that program is encouraging.

28:03.066 --> 28:05.133
But it won't suit everyone.

28:05.133 --> 28:09.400
And at present, it only has
nine jobs for former miners.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.700
And Trump is actively
hurting the chances

28:11.700 --> 28:13.166
of other projects like it.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.233
His new budget
proposes cutting funding

28:15.233 --> 28:16.667
for the Appalachian
Regional Commission,

28:16.667 --> 28:19.433
which helps revitalize
communities affected

28:19.433 --> 28:21.100
by coal mining job losses

28:21.100 --> 28:23.100
by funding employment programs

28:23.100 --> 28:25.100
that have helped,
among other things,

28:25.100 --> 28:26.700
Bit Source.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.066
And you might wonder,

28:28.066 --> 28:30.467
well, why would a guy
who says he lovers miners

28:30.467 --> 28:31.800
all the time do that?

28:31.800 --> 28:34.033
Well, for a sense of how
he really feels,

28:34.033 --> 28:36.533
just read a "Playboy" interview
from 1990,

28:36.533 --> 28:38.233
where he said, and I quote...

28:48.667 --> 28:49.934
And you know what?

28:49.934 --> 28:51.467
They certainly don't have
what Trump has,

28:51.467 --> 28:53.333
specifically inherited wealth

28:53.333 --> 28:57.367
and hair like the wispy pubes
of an aging Yeti.

28:57.367 --> 29:00.133
Look, the point here is,

29:00.133 --> 29:02.800
Trump needs to stop lying
to coal miners.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.300
We all do.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.667
Stop telling them that
their jobs are all coming back

29:06.667 --> 29:08.166
when they're not.
Stop telling them

29:08.166 --> 29:10.066
that coal is clean
when it isn't.

29:10.066 --> 29:12.333
And stop pretending that
this isn't an industry

29:12.333 --> 29:14.500
in the middle of
a difficult and painful,

29:14.500 --> 29:16.633
albeit necessary transition.

29:16.633 --> 29:19.467
An honest conversation about
coal and its miners

29:19.467 --> 29:21.000
needs to be had,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.967
and we should neither
cease nor desist from having it.

29:24.967 --> 29:27.734
Which actually reminds me,
one more thing here.

29:27.734 --> 29:30.166
Bob Murray, I didn't really plan

29:30.166 --> 29:32.700
for so much of this piece
to be about you,

29:32.700 --> 29:35.233
but you kind of forced my hand
on that one.

29:35.233 --> 29:37.567
And I know that you are
probably going to sue me,

29:37.567 --> 29:38.567
but you know what?

29:38.567 --> 29:40.133
I stand by everything I said.

29:40.133 --> 29:41.734
Although, just to reiterate,

29:41.734 --> 29:45.300
I do not think you claimed
a squirrel talked to you.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.300
Even by your standard,

29:47.300 --> 29:49.433
that would be a pretty
ridiculous thing to say.

29:49.433 --> 29:52.333
So I believe that
you have never been spoken to

29:52.333 --> 29:53.667
by a squirrel...

29:53.667 --> 29:56.433
Until, that is, tonight.

29:56.433 --> 29:59.233
Look, Bob.
Look.

29:59.233 --> 30:01.033
Look, Bob.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.900
It's Mr. Nutterbutter, Bob.
Look!

30:03.900 --> 30:05.967
Look.
Huh?

30:05.967 --> 30:07.533
Look.

30:07.533 --> 30:09.367
[cheers and applause]

30:09.367 --> 30:11.567
It's Mr. Nutterbutter!

30:11.567 --> 30:13.467
- Hi, John.
- Hey--hey, there.

30:13.467 --> 30:15.500
Hey, there.
Hey, there, Mr. Nutterbutter.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.667
I understand that you have
a message for Bob Murray.

30:17.667 --> 30:19.867
- I do.
- Okay.

30:19.867 --> 30:21.934
- Hey, Bob.
Just wanted to say,

30:21.934 --> 30:23.166
if you're planning on suing,

30:23.166 --> 30:25.333
I do not have a billion dollars.

30:25.333 --> 30:28.834
But I do have a check
for three acorns and 18 cents.

30:28.834 --> 30:31.200
- Oh, that's--that's very nice
of you, Mr. Nutterbutter.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
- It is.
- Yeah.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.533
- It's made out to...

30:34.533 --> 30:36.433
"Eat Shit, Bob!"

30:36.433 --> 30:39.800
Memo line: "Kiss my ass!"

30:39.800 --> 30:41.567
- Thank you, Mr. Nutterbutter!

30:41.567 --> 30:43.533
That's our show.
Thanks so much for watching.

30:43.533 --> 30:45.367
See you next week.
Good night!

30:45.367 --> 30:48.433
