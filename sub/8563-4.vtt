<i>Tom hanks: Cape gloucester,
new britain--</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>It was one of the most brutal
physical environments</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>The marines would face in the
entire pacific war.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>News aouncer: At cape gloucester</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>In a pre-invasion strike,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>U.S. 5th air force planes
strafed enemy positions</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>And dropped 400 tons of
bombs on the beaches.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>The main objective was to capture
two military airfields</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>On the western tip of new britain</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>In order to isolate a
major japanese base</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>At rabaul on the eastern
end of the island.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>The invasion began December 26,
1943.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Veteran #1: It was the very
beginning of the rainy season</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And honestly I have never seen
it rain anywhere in the world

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Like it did on cape gloucester.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Veteran #4: We stayed wet
most of the time.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And we wore the same clothes

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I think for at least three months.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>My shoes had just about
rotted off completely</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>And two little toenails had
completely gone.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Veteran #1: Everywhere you went
it was knee-deep mud.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Vehicles could barely move.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>We actually saw a
bulldozer go down</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>And disappear in the mud.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>For the marines the conditions
in the jungle</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>And the unrelenting warfare</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Took a physical and
psychological toll.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Veteran #2: The only place I ever saw
the marines morale go to hell.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
As bad as it was in
the other places,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It didn't, but the morale
went straight down.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Veteran #4: Everybody
was exhausted.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>I mean, physically exhausted,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Mentally exhausted.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And you'd get to the point

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
That you just don't give a damn.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You know?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Welcome to australia, mates.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We love you.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
How many japs you kill, yank?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>You kill many japs?</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Everyone's going awol,
nobody's stopping them.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I've gotta be a part of this.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Drink it out of the
glass without spilling.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
- Awww.
- Hey, leckie!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Whoa!  Attaboy. </i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Are you proposing already, yank?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I'm proposing that you
take a walk with me.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You never know what
the future may bring.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You have to go away, bob.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>If you don't come back to us,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>I don't just lose you.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Mama does too.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You're dumping me because you
think I'm gonna get killed?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Leckie, what are you doing?</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Manning this fucking post,
lieutenant.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm the fucking guard on guard duty.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You pull a fucking
sidearm on an officer?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Lieutenant, I went for a quick piss.
Leckie was just covering.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You fucking prick!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>I volunteered you for reassignment</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
To the battalion
intelligence section.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You're booting us?

You shot outside the correction.

03:27.114 --> 03:28.347
Oh, you thought?

03:28.381 --> 03:31.349
For christ's sakes,

03:31.383 --> 03:33.617
"say again your correction,

03:33.652 --> 03:35.786
You got artillery

06:44.482 --> 06:46.216
We all know how well that went.

06:46.251 --> 06:48.584
Hey, leckie, you're not
in "h" company anymore.

06:48.618 --> 06:51.518
No, sir, I'm with lieutenant
larkin in battalion intelligence.

06:51.552 --> 06:53.520
He assigned me to any
"h" company patrols.

06:53.554 --> 06:55.855
Well, that's marine corps in
a nutshell, isn't it, leckie?

06:55.889 --> 06:59.886
They make me an officer and
they put you in intelligence.

06:59.921 --> 07:02.222
Oh, and don't think that
because you'remachine guns,

07:02.256 --> 07:04.223
You're gonna get to
skip these patrols.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.223
Colonel wants everyone to
grab a rifle and lend a hand.

07:06.257 --> 07:08.325
- You understand?
- All: Yes, sir.

07:08.359 --> 07:10.460
Good.

07:10.494 --> 07:13.629
Still chewing gum.
You gotta give him that.

07:13.663 --> 07:15.164
He's the same as he ever was.

07:15.198 --> 07:17.066
For now.

07:19.471 --> 07:21.939
- How's frenchy?
- Who, lebec?

07:21.973 --> 07:24.808
He was a commando at dieppe.
Canucks got fucked.

T.O. To here.

07:29.081 --> 07:31.116

08:38.344 --> 08:40.511
This one's got shrapnel.

08:40.546 --> 08:42.947
They must be around here somewhere.

08:49.018 --> 08:51.052

gonna be two men missing--

<i>- Man: Anything else?

15:05.487 --> 15:08.723
<i>Are running like hell to rabaul.</i>

15:08.757 --> 15:12.225
They left their sick and
wounded at a camp near here.

15:12.259 --> 15:16.256
Another 100 volunteered
for this shit.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.987
100 against 1200.

15:21.286 --> 15:24.650
They're either incredibly
brave or incredibly stupid.

15:25.815 --> 15:28.914

Leckie?

18:58.997 --> 19:01.699
I'll give you just about
anything for this.

19:01.733 --> 19:04.068
I don't even want you touching it.

Gibson, is he okay?

19:22.038 --> 19:24.108
He's just tired.

19:24.142 --> 19:26.281
No wonder you guys don't
talk about guadalcanal.

19:26.315 --> 19:27.749
You didn't do anything.

19:27.783 --> 19:29.819
Apparently, john
basilone did everything.

19:29.853 --> 19:33.022
- Oh, fuck you.
- We all did shit like that

19:33.057 --> 19:35.024
And without all the grimacing.

19:35.059 --> 19:37.794
No, he's back home selling
bonds and dicking blondes

19:37.829 --> 19:39.997
While you're still
here in paradise.

19:40.031 --> 19:42.366
I gotta drop the
kids off at the pool.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.501
Anybody need anything from the bar?

19:44.536 --> 19:47.738

I need it to store
battalion papers.

21:48.063 --> 21:50.530
It's my chest, sir.

21:50.565 --> 21:52.865
Oh?

21:52.899 --> 21:54.633
How so exactly?

21:54.667 --> 21:56.934
I can see where you're
going with that, sir.

21:56.968 --> 22:00.872
And if some dead jap wants to
come back and get his chest,

22:00.906 --> 22:02.807
He can get it from me.

22:02.841 --> 22:04.608
I don't think so, private.

22:04.642 --> 22:07.210
An enlisted man can't
have something like that.

22:07.244 --> 22:08.978
It's against regulations.

22:10.947 --> 22:12.880
What about the pistol?

22:12.915 --> 22:15.215
Using that for a battalion
paperweight, sir?

22:15.249 --> 22:17.516
<i>What pistol?</i>

22:23.855 --> 22:26.524
Battalion papers, sir?

22:27.860 --> 22:30.061
Get out of my tent, leckie.

22:30.095 --> 22:32.797
I'm not in your tent, sir.

22:51.313 --> 22:53.280
god damn it.

22:53.314 --> 22:56.182
All this water coming down,
you didn't think to cover that up?

22:56.216 --> 22:59.518
A live grenade just happens
to roll into his tent.

22:59.552 --> 23:01.319
It's a damn shame.

23:01.353 --> 23:05.321
- Please shut up.
- This is a dangerous place.

23:05.355 --> 23:09.957
Any number of accidents could befall
someone like lieutenant larkin.

23:09.991 --> 23:12.359
Terrible loss for
our forces overseas.

23:12.393 --> 23:16.328
Oh, for god's sakes, coffee is the one
goddamn thing we got to enjoy around here.

23:16.363 --> 23:18.130
We just want to enjoy it in peace.

23:18.165 --> 23:20.599
So either kill larkin
or shut the fuck up.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.544
<i>- Man: Can't get the tent stakes in.
- Leckie!</i>

23:31.578 --> 23:35.013
<i>- Man #2: Keep hammering.
- That you, lieutenant larkin?</i>

23:35.048 --> 23:36.814
Out of the rack, now!

23:36.848 --> 23:39.449
Aye aye, sir.

23:39.483 --> 23:42.885
As of immediately,
you are no longer in intelligence.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.986
Report for clean-up duty
in the officers' mess

23:46.020 --> 23:48.284
Where you will remain
until I order otherwise.

23:48.318 --> 23:49.316
You're the boss, sir.

23:49.351 --> 23:52.416
Don't get cute with me, leckie.

23:52.451 --> 23:55.017
There's something
missing from my tent.

23:55.052 --> 23:58.386
Just to be clear, sir,

23:58.421 --> 24:01.722
You're punishing me on the suspicion
I may have taken something,

24:01.756 --> 24:03.623
The very existence
of which you denied--

24:03.657 --> 24:06.258
Something that, if it did exist,

24:06.292 --> 24:09.393
Would rightfully
belong to me anyway.

24:13.197 --> 24:15.430
Enjoy your time in
the galley, private.

24:15.465 --> 24:17.999
Change of pace might
do me some good, sir.

24:22.903 --> 24:25.671
You might want to change
your skivvies, private.

24:25.705 --> 24:28.740
It appears you have
pissed yourself.

24:28.774 --> 24:31.608
What fucking kind of marine

24:31.643 --> 24:33.777
Pisses himself?

24:45.352 --> 24:46.919
Sounds like enuresis.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.754
Is there anythinyou can
give me for it, doc?

24:48.788 --> 24:50.922
Sorry, leckie, no magic pill.

24:52.524 --> 24:54.591
What do I do?

24:54.626 --> 24:56.860
Stay dry.

24:56.894 --> 25:00.462
Oh. That's funny.

25:00.496 --> 25:02.298
It's not raining today.

25:02.332 --> 25:04.134
Not yet.

26:13.037 --> 26:15.505
Lebec!  Fuck!

27:34.736 --> 27:36.904
That's all I could find.

27:36.939 --> 27:39.673
it's okay.

27:39.708 --> 27:42.507
After the sweats,
the chills feel so good.

27:42.541 --> 27:44.375
I'll get some coffee going.

27:44.409 --> 27:46.247
<i>Let's go the sooner
we finish this,</i>

27:46.281 --> 27:48.486
<i>The sooner we can get some rest.</i>

27:53.694 --> 27:54.894
What?

27:54.928 --> 27:58.197
Read to me, daddy.

28:01.467 --> 28:03.534
"dear vera,

28:03.569 --> 28:05.503
It finally stopped raining,

28:05.537 --> 28:08.772
Only making the smell of
rotten coconuts worse.

28:08.806 --> 28:11.141
<i>The rats and crabs have
come out of hiding.</i>

28:11.175 --> 28:15.477
I've killed more of them in the past
week than I will ever kill japs.

28:15.512 --> 28:18.146
Everyone's sores have gotten worse

28:18.180 --> 28:19.714
Along with their dysentery.

28:19.748 --> 28:23.150
<i>My buddy runner has a bone-cracking
bout of malaria.</i>

28:24.719 --> 28:28.087
This island has an exotic
name that translated

28:28.122 --> 28:30.623
Means 'the death of hope.'

28:30.657 --> 28:33.225
Thinking of you always, robert."

28:35.261 --> 28:37.128
Pavuvu means "death of hope"?

28:37.163 --> 28:39.697
I don't know what it means

28:39.732 --> 28:41.599
And I don't care.

28:41.633 --> 28:45.402
Hey, leckie, your parents ever
send you your dress blues?

28:45.436 --> 28:47.771
That joke stopped being
funny a year ago, hoosier.

28:47.805 --> 28:49.573
I just thought you might
want to get spiffed up.

28:49.607 --> 28:51.642
- Battalion's holding a lottery.
- What's the prize?

28:51.676 --> 28:54.545
- A bullet in the head?
- A ticket home.

28:54.579 --> 28:57.281
You did put my name in here,
didn't you?

28:59.418 --> 29:01.886
Okay, good luck, all of you.

29:03.288 --> 29:06.690
<i>- "g" company, second platoon--
- man: That's me!</i>

29:06.724 --> 29:08.626
Private bower!

29:14.799 --> 29:16.765
All right, settle down.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.632
"h" company, heavy weapons!

29:19.666 --> 29:22.099
Private jackson.

29:26.436 --> 29:29.003
<i>"I" company, first platoon!</i>

29:29.004 --> 29:31.171
<i>Private guest!</i>

29:31.205 --> 29:33.839
<i>"I" compaatoon!</i>

29:36.808 --> 29:38.808
I pulled another
crab out of my hooch.

29:38.842 --> 29:41.010
- Yeah?
- It's as big as a mortar.

29:41.044 --> 29:43.145
Hey, leckie, food.

29:44.814 --> 29:48.115
leckie, hot food.

29:49.985 --> 29:52.386
Come on, buddy. You still asleep?

30:03.163 --> 30:05.564
Oh, buddy.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.844
Has he moved at all yet?

30:19.879 --> 30:21.513
Not an inch.

30:21.547 --> 30:23.915
- You feelin' better, conley?
- Swell.

30:30.389 --> 30:32.423
Hey, leckie.

30:33.591 --> 30:36.860
I see your enuresis is acting up.

30:39.163 --> 30:40.833
Hey, I got good news:

30:40.867 --> 30:43.840
They got a hospital overn banika a hop,
skip and a jump from here.

30:43.874 --> 30:47.043
I'm gonna pull some paper and
you'll be on your way in an hour.

30:48.712 --> 30:50.982
<i>All you need is a week or two--</i>

30:51.016 --> 30:53.051
Get dry and stay dry.

30:53.086 --> 30:55.754
That should do the trick. You game?

30:59.994 --> 31:01.295
Great.

31:01.329 --> 31:03.397
I'm gonna go get you
some fresh dungarees.

31:03.432 --> 31:05.066
Be right back.

31:27.260 --> 31:31.395
Take off your clothes
and put these on.

31:37.836 --> 31:39.871
No razor blades.

31:39.906 --> 31:42.908
<i>I'll need your belt too.</i>

31:45.645 --> 31:47.813
What do you want
me to do with this?

31:50.183 --> 31:52.818
You scared the living
shit out of ruddiger.

31:52.852 --> 31:55.287
He'll probably put in
for a purple heart.

31:57.423 --> 31:59.091
What am I doing here?

31:59.125 --> 32:00.892
It says here you have enuresis.

32:00.927 --> 32:04.262
Why am I in with guys who need to
have their razor blades taken away?

32:04.297 --> 32:06.264
The main ward is full.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.967
They put overflow with me.

32:09.001 --> 32:12.037
It's the navy. What can you do?

32:12.071 --> 32:13.972
Smoke?

32:15.307 --> 32:18.276
I'll talk to a specialist
about your urine problem.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.445
Until then, it okay if
ruddiger wakes you up

32:20.479 --> 32:22.413
Every hour or two during the night?

32:22.414 --> 32:24.549
<i>Give you a chae to get to the
head and stay dry.</i>

32:24.583 --> 32:26.150
Every hour or two
during the night?Sure.

32:26.185 --> 32:28.553
<i>Go easy on him.</i>

32:29.822 --> 32:31.422
Is that it?

32:31.457 --> 32:33.391
<i>That's it.</i>

32:34.827 --> 32:37.528
Don't miss dinner.
Pumpkin pie tonight.

32:41.900 --> 32:45.870
You, uh, you ever think
about selling this?

32:47.072 --> 32:49.906
- No, sir.
- Oh.

32:49.940 --> 32:52.842
You get it back when you leave.

33:59.010 --> 34:01.110
Mother of christ.

34:06.650 --> 34:08.817
Where the fuck were you?

34:08.852 --> 34:12.086
Hey, you want to keep it down?
People are trying to sleep.

34:13.488 --> 34:15.356
Put 'em on.

34:30.038 --> 34:33.508
Don't mind captain midnight.
He does that most nights.

34:40.519 --> 34:43.453
Congratulations.
You passed the test.

34:43.487 --> 34:45.521
What test?

34:45.556 --> 34:48.424
You actually do
suffer from enuresis.

34:48.458 --> 34:51.093
You thought I was lying?

34:51.127 --> 34:53.996
Well, you know, a lot of guys
will say just about anything

34:54.031 --> 34:56.699
To get a couple of weeks
of clean sheets, burgers

34:56.734 --> 35:00.403
And "the pause that refreshes."

35:00.437 --> 35:02.537
Fuck you.

35:06.275 --> 35:09.778
What about captain midnight?
Is he faking?

35:09.812 --> 35:11.112
Who?

35:11.146 --> 35:13.348
The guys that paces around
all night flying his plane.

35:13.382 --> 35:16.785
Ah, stanfield. No.

35:16.819 --> 35:19.387
I'd say he's just...

35:19.421 --> 35:21.789
Exhausted, worn out.

35:22.958 --> 35:25.259
That's your medical opinion? Shit.

35:25.294 --> 35:28.329
- I could do your job.
- I bet you could.

35:30.766 --> 35:33.200
I get it.

35:33.235 --> 35:35.602
Some give and take over
hamburgers? I get it.

35:35.637 --> 35:38.305
Okay, doc, what's next?

35:38.339 --> 35:41.374
Wanna know how old I was when
my mom took me off her tit?

35:41.409 --> 35:44.411
I mean, that's the type of shit
you headshrinkers ke, right?

35:44.445 --> 35:48.715
You wanna know why I'm
in your loony bin.

35:51.152 --> 35:54.320
Back home, after you've won
the war for guys like me,

35:54.355 --> 35:56.756
I'd be happy to take a run
at shrinking your head...

35:56.791 --> 35:58.591
For 20 bucks an hour.

35:58.626 --> 36:00.760
But here--

36:00.795 --> 36:05.632
All I do here is assess...

36:05.666 --> 36:09.102
<i>Who can return to his
unit and who can't.</i>

36:09.136 --> 36:11.804
<i>So your head is safe with me.</i>

36:14.441 --> 36:16.642
You know, most of the guys
that come through here

36:16.677 --> 36:19.912
Are simply tired.

36:19.947 --> 36:22.682
My guess is you fall
into that category.

36:29.356 --> 36:31.890
They murdered sleep.

36:36.229 --> 36:39.498
On guadalcanal, the japs would
send a bomber in every night.

36:39.532 --> 36:42.934
It was mostly just
to keep us awake.

36:42.969 --> 36:45.704
On gloucester, it was the rain.

36:45.738 --> 36:49.674
On pavuvu, it was just the
fucking fact I was on pavuvu.

36:55.114 --> 36:57.882
For the record, doc,
I was a freshman in high school

36:57.917 --> 36:59.717
When my mom stopped
breastfeeding me.

36:59.752 --> 37:02.353
Do you see that as a problem?

37:39.723 --> 37:42.758
You're a coward! A fucking coward.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.327
<i>Hey hey hey.</i>

37:44.361 --> 37:46.229
I'm getting out of your reach,
you fucking shit!

37:46.764 --> 37:48.632
- Fucking coward.
- Hey, shh.  Hey, shh.

37:48.666 --> 37:52.469
You're a dead man.
You fucking shit!

37:52.504 --> 37:56.273
go get dr. Grant!

37:56.307 --> 37:58.642
Right in here, boys.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.446
- Here you go.
- Okay.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.614
Okay.

38:05.351 --> 38:06.785
Wanna put restraints on him?

38:06.819 --> 38:08.853
No no, not necessary.
He'll be out for the night.

38:08.888 --> 38:09.955
Okay.

38:09.989 --> 38:12.024
Thanks, leckie.

38:16.797 --> 38:18.397
<i>How's your nose? You all right?</i>

38:18.432 --> 38:20.433
<i>I'll be all right.</i>

38:22.236 --> 38:26.404
Hey, got a smoke?

38:26.439 --> 38:28.004
I ran out.

38:42.247 --> 38:43.681
Gibson.

38:43.715 --> 38:45.549
Hey.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.719
Hey, it's me,

38:47.753 --> 38:50.120
Bob leckie.

38:52.056 --> 38:53.991
Hey, leckie.

39:21.378 --> 39:23.078
You know gibson?

39:23.113 --> 39:25.113
We were on gloucester together.

39:25.148 --> 39:27.582
The 'canal before that.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.717
What's he doing here?

39:29.751 --> 39:32.753
Your buddy wanted to get
off pavuvu and go home.

39:32.787 --> 39:36.089
There's nothing crazy about that.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.958
<i>He attempted to steal a
plane to do it.</i>

39:38.993 --> 39:41.460
And when they stopped him,

39:41.495 --> 39:43.829
He tried to kill himself.

39:48.067 --> 39:51.235
<i>I'm fortunate, aren't I?</i>

39:52.204 --> 39:55.005
This is as bad as my war gets.

40:09.620 --> 40:13.223
It would take more than hot water,
I'll tell you that.

40:18.630 --> 40:20.397
<i>No offense, doc--</i>

40:20.431 --> 40:22.566
<i>I don't think I like this place.</i>

40:22.600 --> 40:25.436
Why not?

40:25.470 --> 40:28.839
People see places like
banika on newsreels,

40:28.874 --> 40:31.275
They think this is what
the war is really like.

40:31.309 --> 40:33.510
I don't know what the war is like.

40:33.545 --> 40:35.579
Sure you do.

40:35.613 --> 40:38.749
You see it in every guy
who comes through here.

40:43.454 --> 40:45.622
This isn't the right place for me.

40:47.124 --> 40:49.492
Nothing against all of you,
but I want to get back to my guys

40:49.527 --> 40:51.995
Before they get sent on without me.

40:54.098 --> 40:57.233
That's not some crazy
thought, is it?

41:01.405 --> 41:04.273
Why not just...

41:04.308 --> 41:06.442
Hang around for, say, another week?

41:06.477 --> 41:09.645
I don't think that would
be healthy for me, doc.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.582
Listen, if you're not
above taking a bribe,

41:12.616 --> 41:14.684
That jap pistol I brought--

41:14.718 --> 41:16.452
You can have it.

41:16.487 --> 41:19.355
Really?

41:19.389 --> 41:21.958
How much?

41:21.992 --> 41:25.428
Now it wouldn't be a
bribe if I charged you.

41:25.463 --> 41:28.031
It's on the house. No ammo.

41:28.065 --> 41:31.034
Things get crazy around here,
I wouldn't want you killing yourself.

41:31.068 --> 41:33.470
That's not my style.

41:33.504 --> 41:36.139
I drink and chase nurses.

41:38.776 --> 41:42.513
Why just give me the pistol?

41:42.547 --> 41:46.683
I mean, you must have gone
through a lot to bring it here.

41:46.718 --> 41:48.752
Why just give it away?

41:50.788 --> 41:54.423
I'm rested, I'm fit-
I want to return to my unit

41:54.458 --> 41:56.592
And my friends.

41:56.626 --> 41:58.427
Please.

42:02.531 --> 42:04.899
Sign the papers, doc.

42:06.635 --> 42:09.570
<i>Five, 10...</i>

42:14.875 --> 42:17.243
<i>- Come on, big spender.
- Man #2: Jack.</i>

42:20.781 --> 42:24.016
<i>King... King...</i>

42:31.930 --> 42:34.565
<i>Deuce... Seven.</i>

42:35.467 --> 42:37.435
Hey, gib?

42:43.441 --> 42:47.811
I wanted to give you
these before I take off.

42:54.854 --> 42:56.956
Thanks.

42:58.425 --> 43:00.225
They letting you out?

43:00.260 --> 43:02.695
I volunteered to leave,

43:02.729 --> 43:04.363
Actually.

43:04.397 --> 43:06.932
Why'd you do that?

43:06.967 --> 43:11.270
Eh, want to get back to the guys
before they ship off without me.

43:11.304 --> 43:14.673
I don't think they'll send me back.

43:17.276 --> 43:19.577
I sure ain't asking.

43:26.618 --> 43:29.020
Gib,

43:29.054 --> 43:31.322
You just need a rest.

43:31.356 --> 43:33.624
That's all.

43:36.628 --> 43:39.229
Just a break from it all.

43:40.164 --> 43:41.798
You'll be all right.

43:41.833 --> 43:44.167
You think so?

43:50.074 --> 43:53.509
On guadalcanal,

43:53.544 --> 43:55.745
I was coming back from the airfield

43:55.779 --> 43:57.913
With a work party.

44:00.116 --> 44:02.785
Jap planes came in

44:02.819 --> 44:06.188
Dropping 500 lb'ers while
we were out in the open.

44:06.222 --> 44:10.659
<i>All we could do is jump into a
slit trench and cover up.</i>

44:13.162 --> 44:15.897
There was this guy--

44:15.931 --> 44:18.800
I didn't know him--

44:18.834 --> 44:21.403
He was tucked in behind me.

44:23.639 --> 44:26.742
I could feel his heart beating,

44:26.776 --> 44:29.845
His lungs fighting for air...

44:29.880 --> 44:34.517
And his lips on my back as he
prayed to god to keep him alive.

44:34.552 --> 44:37.888
<i>He believed god would save him.</i>

44:40.158 --> 44:43.661
Jesus, I envied him.

44:51.571 --> 44:54.841
Thanks for the smokes.

44:54.875 --> 44:57.544
There's nothing to
do in here but smoke.

44:57.578 --> 44:59.679
Sure.

45:06.287 --> 45:09.289
I hope it's quick and
easy for you, leckie.

45:11.926 --> 45:14.193
Jap sniper, maybe.

45:17.197 --> 45:21.033
You get nailed in the
first two minutes.

45:21.067 --> 45:24.001
No worries about ending up like me.
