<i>Accessing archived data.</i>

00:07.743 --> 00:09.178
You again?

00:09.212 --> 00:11.980
<i>Paige
doggedly pursues the Renegade,</i>

00:12.015 --> 00:14.249
<i>unaware she's let him go once before.</i>

00:15.418 --> 00:17.186
<i>One goes free! One goes free!</i>

00:17.220 --> 00:21.223
You did promise the crowd freedom.
One should go free.

00:21.257 --> 00:25.060
<i>Meanwhile...
Tesler sets his sight on a new enemy.</i>

00:25.095 --> 00:28.430
Keller betrayed us.
She neutralized the pathogen.

00:28.465 --> 00:30.299
<i>Then find Keller.</i>

00:31.334 --> 00:33.202
<i>And neutralize her.</i>

00:35.505 --> 00:38.340
<i>To serve Clu is a privilege.</i>

00:38.375 --> 00:41.076
<i>Defiance will not be tolerated.</i>

00:41.111 --> 00:43.345
<i>Report the defector immediately.</i>

00:47.417 --> 00:50.386
<i>To serve Clu is a privilege.</i>

00:50.420 --> 00:52.488
<i>Defiance will not be tolerated.</i>

00:52.522 --> 00:55.023
<i>Report the defector immediately.</i>

01:02.399 --> 01:04.465
There she is. Get her.

01:28.391 --> 01:32.194
What did I do? Just tell me!

01:32.228 --> 01:34.463
- It's not Keller.
- Keep looking.

01:43.173 --> 01:45.474
<i>To serve Clu is a privilege.</i>

01:45.508 --> 01:48.277
<i>Defiance will not be tolerated.</i>

01:48.311 --> 01:51.079
<i>Report the defector immediately.</i>

01:51.114 --> 01:53.783
Ha. Looks like you just made it.

01:54.317 --> 01:58.287
You can say that again.
Let's hope they find this defector soon.

01:58.321 --> 02:01.190
Agreed. Ticket, please.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.965
Enjoy your trip to Bismuth.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.371
<i>To serve Clu is a privilege.</i>

02:16.406 --> 02:20.008
<i>Defiance will not be tolerated.</i>

02:20.043 --> 02:22.177
<i>Report the defector immediately.</i>

02:28.318 --> 02:31.386
CTC operational.
Marking coordinates.

02:45.201 --> 02:49.137
Hello, Keller. Going somewhere?

02:51.323 --> 03:00.823
<b>S01E16 - Welcome Home</b>

03:05.581 --> 03:07.215
<i>Don't make a scene.</i>

03:08.251 --> 03:10.519
- Who are you?
- Let's just say I'm part of

03:10.553 --> 03:13.188
a growing resistance movement in Argon.

03:13.222 --> 03:15.190
And we could use someone
with your talents.

03:15.224 --> 03:16.425
I am not interested.

03:16.459 --> 03:20.262
Look, no one defects from Tesler's
army and gets away with it.

03:20.296 --> 03:22.431
Without my help,
you don't stand...

03:22.465 --> 03:24.166
What is it?

03:24.200 --> 03:27.502
Don't. One of Tesler's
soldiers just entered the bar.

03:27.537 --> 03:30.072
You're clear. Keep a look out.

03:31.107 --> 03:32.274
We can't just sit here.

03:33.543 --> 03:35.243
Your disguise...

03:38.281 --> 03:39.548
Oh!

03:39.582 --> 03:41.283
Forget it. There's no time.

03:42.452 --> 03:44.286
Go! Take the stairs.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.420
Paige!

03:46.456 --> 03:48.490
- How've you been?
- What?

03:48.524 --> 03:51.326
It's me, Beck.
Don't you remember?

03:53.329 --> 03:55.230
Come on, don't be like that.

03:55.264 --> 03:58.233
Me, you? The games?

03:58.267 --> 04:01.069
- We talked.
- I talk to a lot of programs.

04:01.104 --> 04:04.239
But we had something.
You were putting me in light cuffs.

04:04.273 --> 04:06.475
I smiled. You didn't.

04:06.509 --> 04:09.478
I said the cuffs were too tight.
You said you didn't care.

04:09.512 --> 04:15.016
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- Maybe this will jog your memory.

04:15.051 --> 04:18.019
<i>"One goes free! One goes free!"</i>

04:19.122 --> 04:22.424
Oh, you. I remember now.

04:22.458 --> 04:27.229
Your disc skills were
adequate for an amateur.

04:28.464 --> 04:32.234
Don't feel bad. I'm sure
you excel at your real job.

04:32.268 --> 04:36.037
<i>Tell me, do you find
waste disposal satisfying?</i>

04:36.072 --> 04:37.472
<i>Ha. Now who thinks she's funny?</i>

04:37.507 --> 04:41.243
For you information,
I'm a... I'm an architect.

04:41.277 --> 04:43.145
I'm sure your friends are proud.

04:43.179 --> 04:46.148
Now move along, architect.
I've got a job to do.

04:57.426 --> 04:59.261
Pavel.

05:16.078 --> 05:19.047
Get back on that chopper, Pavel.

05:19.081 --> 05:23.418
- Paige, how nice to see you too.
- I don't need your help.

05:23.452 --> 05:28.023
Unfortunately, our always
trenchant leader thinks otherwise.

05:28.057 --> 05:31.393
<i>- I've got it under control.
- You've got nothing.</i>

05:31.427 --> 05:35.063
Not Keller or a clue how to catch her!

05:45.374 --> 05:47.242
<i>I told you I'll handle it.</i>

05:47.276 --> 05:51.046
<i>If Keller's on this train
she won't reach Bismuth.</i>

05:51.080 --> 05:54.316
You're right.
Because it seems I just flushed her out!

05:57.086 --> 05:59.087
<i>Open fire!</i>

06:31.287 --> 06:34.356
<i>Warning.
Braking system malfunction.</i>

06:34.390 --> 06:37.058
<i>System inoperative.</i>

06:38.160 --> 06:39.995
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

06:40.029 --> 06:43.031
<i>Ecstatic.
You can thank me later.</i>

06:43.065 --> 06:46.334
<i>Preferably on one knee in
front of General Tesler.</i>

06:46.369 --> 06:50.071
Thank you?
You and your trigger-happy pilot

06:50.106 --> 06:53.074
just turned this train into
a high speed death sentence

06:53.109 --> 06:55.143
for hundreds of programs!

06:55.177 --> 06:59.147
What I did, you ingrate,
was keep your target from escaping,

06:59.181 --> 07:01.483
while guaranteeing her early demise.

07:01.517 --> 07:04.352
Now get aboard, and if you're
nice I might hang around

07:04.387 --> 07:06.154
long enough to watch the fireworks.

07:07.423 --> 07:09.324
I've found there's
nothing like the sound of

07:09.358 --> 07:12.093
twisting wreckage to help me sleep.

07:12.128 --> 07:17.365
I am not leaving without Keller.
Not until this job's finished.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.202
Oh, Paige.
How I'm going to miss you.

07:21.237 --> 07:24.439
<i>Always predictable
right to the bitter end!</i>

07:30.212 --> 07:33.181
<i>Emergency procedures activated.</i>

07:33.215 --> 07:36.351
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

07:36.385 --> 07:39.387
<i>Emergency procedures activated.</i>

07:39.422 --> 07:42.190
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

07:51.300 --> 07:52.434
Are you crazy?

07:54.070 --> 07:57.105
Getting yourself
killed isn't the answer.

07:57.139 --> 07:59.341
And neither is joining
some rag-tag revolution.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.350
- Give us a chance.
- No. I'm not in this to choose sides.

08:08.384 --> 08:12.954
What I want is to start over.
And Bismuth is just that.

08:12.989 --> 08:15.123
If I can get there, I can disappear.

08:15.157 --> 08:16.157
No!

08:23.032 --> 08:24.332
Uh, then again...

08:24.367 --> 08:27.268
maybe that's no longer
an option for me.

08:27.303 --> 08:29.938
Don't say that. Whether you
decide to help us or not,

08:29.972 --> 08:32.340
I'm going to get you
off this train alive.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.075
Now stay out of sight.

08:36.445 --> 08:38.980
- Step aside.
- What happened?

08:39.015 --> 08:40.982
Technical difficulties.
Now move.

08:41.017 --> 08:43.150
- I'm looking for somebody.
- Like me?

08:43.184 --> 08:45.987
- Excuse me?
- I'm who you're looking for.

08:47.023 --> 08:50.025
- Do you wanna get hurt?
- No, I wanna repair the train.

08:50.059 --> 08:54.362
- How? You're an architect.
- I'm not really. I'm a mechanic.

08:55.431 --> 08:57.065
Why did you lie?

08:57.099 --> 09:00.268
I-I wanted to impress you.
I'm sorry.

09:00.302 --> 09:02.303
It sounded like a good idea at the time.

09:06.075 --> 09:07.315
<i>Damage containment in progress.</i>

09:07.343 --> 09:11.112
<i>Access to engine car now closed.</i>

09:11.147 --> 09:12.914
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

09:12.948 --> 09:17.352
<i>Please be advised,
damage containment in progress.</i>

09:17.386 --> 09:20.955
<i>Access to engine car now closed.</i>

09:20.990 --> 09:22.257
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

09:22.291 --> 09:26.194
Fine. You wanna impress me?
Fix that.

09:40.002 --> 09:42.270
The throttle's fused.

09:42.304 --> 09:45.073
We won't be able to stop
at the Bismuth depot.

09:45.107 --> 09:49.244
- Then we're all going to die.
- Not all of us.

09:49.278 --> 09:52.113
I checked the schematics.

09:52.147 --> 09:54.349
The two-seat escape pod
is still operational.

09:54.383 --> 09:57.352
But it's in the engine car.
It's sealed off.

09:57.386 --> 10:00.121
Not if we come at it from outside.

10:00.155 --> 10:03.324
- We're going too fast.
- We don't have a choice.

10:08.197 --> 10:10.365
If you can't do it, just say so.

10:10.399 --> 10:13.001
For all I know you lied
about being a mechanic, too.

10:13.035 --> 10:16.004
Nope. But I did lie about
wanting to impress you.

10:17.039 --> 10:19.440
If you ask me, you've been
impressed with me since we met.

10:21.176 --> 10:24.012
Absolutely.
And why is that again?

10:24.046 --> 10:26.114
I-I can't seem to remember.

10:35.124 --> 10:36.391
Any more questions?

10:55.344 --> 10:57.178
Take me with you!

11:08.090 --> 11:10.058
Ott, look out!

11:19.301 --> 11:21.369
<i>Sorry. Nothing I can do.</i>

11:21.403 --> 11:23.404
<i>There's not enough code left to repair.</i>

11:23.439 --> 11:26.140
<i>Then you need to find another
way to stop this train.</i>

11:26.175 --> 11:28.409
<i>I'm not about to let
all these programs die.</i>

11:28.444 --> 11:32.113
<i>Since when does the occupation
care about sparing innocent lives?</i>

11:32.147 --> 11:34.315
<i>You don't know me, mechanic.
Don't act like you do.</i>

11:35.351 --> 11:36.351
Fair enough.

11:38.153 --> 11:41.422
Get on the com.
Tell everyone to move to the rear cars.

11:41.457 --> 11:43.991
I'm gonna uncouple us from the engine.

11:44.026 --> 11:45.426
If we do it soon enough, the rear cars

11:45.461 --> 11:48.096
should slow to a stop on
their own before we derail.

11:48.130 --> 11:50.231
And if they don't?

11:50.265 --> 11:53.368
Then it won't matter if you're
impressed with me or not.

11:53.402 --> 11:56.170
<i>Move to the rear of the train.</i>

11:56.205 --> 12:02.009
<i>Repeat, for your own safety,
move to the rear of the train.</i>

12:02.044 --> 12:04.445
<i>Move to the rear of the train.</i>

12:04.480 --> 12:09.083
<i>Repeat, for your own safety,
move to the rear of the train.</i>

12:17.393 --> 12:22.230
- You got a handle on this?
- Wait. You can't leave.

12:22.264 --> 12:23.965
Excuse me?

12:23.999 --> 12:27.201
Uh, this coupling's
not gonna sever itself.

12:29.004 --> 12:31.272
Ha. You worry
too much, mechanic.

12:31.306 --> 12:34.442
Especially when I'm around.

12:36.178 --> 12:38.146
I doubt I'm the only one.

12:40.215 --> 12:41.983
Meaning?

12:42.050 --> 12:44.352
Meaning you didn't exactly
board this train to take

12:44.386 --> 12:47.054
a leisurely ride
to Bismuth, did you?

12:48.223 --> 12:50.425
Like I told you.
I'm looking for someone.

12:50.459 --> 12:52.126
And what happens when you find them?

12:52.161 --> 12:55.396
Anybody ever tell you,
you ask too many questions?

12:57.299 --> 13:01.002
- We did it.
- Good work.

13:02.371 --> 13:05.206
What's it feel like to
save some lives for once?

13:05.240 --> 13:07.975
For your information,
I wasn't always a soldier.

13:08.010 --> 13:09.043
Oh, yeah?

13:14.316 --> 13:17.351
- But I am now.
- Paige! No!

13:41.310 --> 13:42.977
<i>Keller!</i>

13:44.112 --> 13:45.379
- No. Wait.
- Employees only.

13:45.414 --> 13:47.048
<i>Open it!</i>

13:53.288 --> 13:55.456
Okay, Beck. You can do this.

14:09.304 --> 14:10.304
No!

14:22.384 --> 14:23.951
<i>Keller!</i>

14:31.193 --> 14:32.326
<i>Argon City express.</i>

14:32.361 --> 14:34.996
<i>Now entering Bismuth station.</i>

14:35.330 --> 14:38.132
<i>Now exiting Bismuth station.</i>

15:07.029 --> 15:09.130
You shouldn't have
followed me, mechanic.

15:09.164 --> 15:12.166
- You're only making this more difficult.
- Don't do this.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.269
That program you're after
is no different than the rest of us.

15:15.304 --> 15:17.071
She just wants to get
off this train alive

15:17.105 --> 15:19.106
and go back to her... life.

15:19.141 --> 15:23.077
<i>I told you. You worry too much.</i>

15:53.331 --> 15:57.334
Come out, Keller. I'm unarmed.

15:57.368 --> 16:03.140
I want you to listen carefully.
I'm not here to hurt you.

16:03.174 --> 16:06.877
I'm here to take you back
to Argon. No questions asked.

16:08.980 --> 16:12.983
<i>I know. Hard to believe, right?</i>

16:13.017 --> 16:16.086
I can understand your hesitance.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.991
Not too long ago, General Tesler
offered me a second chance.

16:21.025 --> 16:23.860
I didn't know whether or
not to trust him either.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.263
But it turned out,
he meant what he said.

16:26.297 --> 16:29.866
And he's willing
to do the same for you.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.969
All you have to do is
let me take you to him.

16:38.876 --> 16:39.876
The bridge.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.250
You two can fight it out later.

16:47.285 --> 16:51.088
Right now, you're gonna need
to hold on for your life.

16:53.958 --> 16:57.227
If we make it out of this alive,
I just want you to know...

16:57.295 --> 16:59.129
my offer still stands.

17:04.135 --> 17:05.868
Starting now.

17:41.305 --> 17:43.273
Go! Go!

17:43.307 --> 17:44.941
Come on! Run!

18:30.188 --> 18:33.990
Oh, oh, he did it!

19:08.893 --> 19:10.026
Hold on.

19:11.162 --> 19:13.730
You're alive!
I can't believe it.

19:13.764 --> 19:15.899
I thought you were derezzed for sure.

19:16.934 --> 19:19.002
Yeah. So did I.

19:19.036 --> 19:22.973
I have to admit,
you are one impressive mechanic.

19:23.007 --> 19:25.976
That's good to know.
Because I'm a terrible architect.

19:26.010 --> 19:27.010
<i>Paige!</i>

19:27.044 --> 19:29.012
There's something I've gotta tell you.

19:30.114 --> 19:34.678
This program... he's...

19:34.713 --> 19:38.822
he's a real hero.
If he wasn't on board,

19:38.856 --> 19:43.193
I'm pretty sure things
would've ended differently.

19:43.227 --> 19:49.132
- Good luck.
- You should be proud of yourself.

19:49.166 --> 19:52.836
- You saved many lives today.
- Thanks.

19:52.870 --> 19:54.137
It feels good, doesn't it?

19:54.171 --> 19:57.774
None of the soldiers
under my command know this,

19:57.808 --> 20:02.078
but I was originally
programmed to be a medic.

20:02.113 --> 20:05.248
Saving someone's life
is still important to me.

20:05.283 --> 20:09.052
You know what?
That's pretty impressive, too.

20:09.086 --> 20:12.188
Hey, here's an idea.

20:12.223 --> 20:15.792
Why don't you look me up
when you get back to Argon?

20:15.826 --> 20:17.928
Maybe we can hang out.

20:19.964 --> 20:23.199
Really? I-I mean, sure.

20:23.234 --> 20:24.834
I'd like that.

20:27.838 --> 20:29.039
<i>Me, too.</i>

20:36.247 --> 20:37.914
<i>Keller,</i>

20:37.949 --> 20:41.151
I can't tell you how happy
I am to see you again.

20:41.185 --> 20:43.954
I'm happy to be home, sir.

20:43.988 --> 20:48.058
Keller's reprieve is
greatly appreciated, General.

20:48.092 --> 20:50.961
I know you'll help her
as you helped me.

20:51.996 --> 20:56.099
Of course. Now leave us.

20:56.133 --> 20:58.802
She and I have much to discuss.

21:05.876 --> 21:11.781
To serve Clu is a privilege.
I won't let you down again, sir.

21:11.816 --> 21:14.217
I won't.

21:19.991 --> 21:23.093
I know you won't.

21:24.127 --> 21:26.129
No!

21:30.835 --> 21:32.235
Welcome home.
