00:37.872 --> 00:41.333
[Bell]<i> I was sheriff of this</i>
<i>county when I was 25 years old.</i>

00:41.959 --> 00:44.043
<i>Hard to believe.</i>

00:44.085 --> 00:45.880
<i>My grandfather was a lawman.</i>

00:45.921 --> 00:48.549
<i>Father, too.</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:50.509
<i>Me and him was sheriffs</i>
<i>at the same time,</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:53.428
<i>him up in Plano</i>
<i>and me out here.</i>

00:53.470 --> 00:55.389
<i>I think he's</i>
<i>pretty proud of that.</i>

00:56.598 --> 00:58.141
<i>I know I was.</i>

00:59.768 --> 01:03.188
<i>Some of the old-time sheriffs</i>
<i>never even wore a gun.</i>

01:03.230 --> 01:05.148
<i>A lot of folks find that</i>
<i>hard to believe.</i>

01:05.190 --> 01:06.775
<i>Jim Scarborough</i>
<i>never carried one.</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:08.402
<i>That's the younger Jim.</i>

01:08.443 --> 01:13.032
<i>Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear</i>
<i>one up in Comanche County.</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:15.826
<i>I always liked to hear</i>
<i>about the old-timers.</i>

01:16.660 --> 01:20.039
<i>Never missed a chance to do so.</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:24.292
<i>You can't help but compare</i>
<i>yourself against the old-timers</i>

01:24.334 --> 01:28.171
<i>can't help but wonder</i>
<i>how they'd have operated</i>
<i>these times.</i>

01:28.213 --> 01:30.382
<i>There's this boy</i>
<i>I sent to the electric chair</i>

01:30.424 --> 01:32.342
<i>at Huntsville here</i>
<i>a while back.</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:36.013
<i>My arrest and my testimony.</i>

01:37.932 --> 01:41.268
<i>He killed a 14-year-old girl.</i>

01:41.309 --> 01:43.729
<i>Papers said it was</i>
<i>a crime of passion,</i>

01:43.771 --> 01:46.648
<i>but he told me there wasn't</i>
<i>any passion to it.</i>

01:46.690 --> 01:49.026
<i>Told me he'd been planning</i>
<i>to kill somebody</i>

01:49.068 --> 01:50.945
<i>for about as long</i>
<i>as he could remember.</i>

01:50.986 --> 01:53.948
<i>Said if they turned him out,</i>
<i>he'd do it again.</i>

01:53.989 --> 01:55.783
<i>Said he knew</i>
<i>he was going to hell.</i>

01:56.825 --> 01:59.119
<i>Be there in about 15 minutes.</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:00.829
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what to make of that.</i>

02:02.039 --> 02:03.665
<i>I sure do don't.</i>

02:05.626 --> 02:08.754
<i>The crime you see now,</i>
<i>it's hard to even take</i>
<i>its measure.</i>

02:10.297 --> 02:13.759
<i>It's not that I'm afraid of it.</i>

02:13.801 --> 02:18.555
<i>I always knew</i>
<i>you had to be willing to die</i>
<i>to even do this job.</i>

02:18.597 --> 02:22.183
<i>But I don't want</i>
<i>to push my chips forward</i>

02:22.225 --> 02:26.187
<i>and go out and meet something</i>
<i>I don't understand.</i>

02:30.067 --> 02:33.028
<i>A man would have</i>
<i>to put his soul at hazard.</i>

02:34.613 --> 02:36.364
<i>He'd have to say, "Okay.</i>

02:40.869 --> 02:42.913
<i>I'll be part of this world."</i>

02:44.456 --> 02:47.459
Yes, sir,
I just walked in the door.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.753
Sheriff, he had some
sort of thing on him,

02:49.795 --> 02:53.256
like a oxygen tank for
emphysema or something

02:53.298 --> 02:55.926
and a hose that
run down his sleeve.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.094
[Lamar]<i> Oxygen tank?</i>

02:57.136 --> 02:58.512
<i>What the hell's</i>
<i>he got that for?</i>

02:58.553 --> 02:59.721
You got me.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.431
Well, you can look at it
when you get in.

03:01.473 --> 03:02.474
<i>I'll be down there in a bit.</i>

03:02.516 --> 03:04.225
Yes, sir,
I got it under control.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.479
[grunting]

03:19.616 --> 03:21.618

04:06.747 --> 04:08.707
[police siren sounds]

04:42.449 --> 04:44.159
Howdy. What's this about?

04:44.201 --> 04:46.036
Step out of the car,
please, sir.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.871
What is that?

04:47.913 --> 04:49.873
I need you to step
out of the car, sir.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.715
[man] What is that for?

05:00.175 --> 05:02.677
Would you hold still,
please, sir?

05:32.624 --> 05:33.667
You hold still.

05:37.838 --> 05:38.672
[gun fires]

05:44.385 --> 05:45.553
Shit.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.486

[speaking Spanish]

09:16.473 --> 09:18.350

09:35.867 --> 09:37.452
I ain't got no water.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.508
[speaking Spanish]

09:53.301 --> 09:54.844
I told you,
I ain't got no<i> agua.</i>

10:10.026 --> 10:11.027
Do you speak English?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.407
Where's the last guy?

10:15.449 --> 10:18.785
<i>Ultimo hombre.</i>
Last man standing.
There must have been one.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.412
Where'd he go?

10:26.709 --> 10:29.712
I reckon I go out
the way I come in.

10:29.754 --> 10:33.550
[speaking Spanish]

10:35.469 --> 10:37.095
There ain't no<i> lobos.</i>

10:51.901 --> 10:54.195
[Llewelyn] You stopped
to watch your backtrack.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.450
Now shoot my dumb ass.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.413
But if you stop,

11:04.914 --> 11:06.541
you stopped in shade.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.988
[fly buzzing]

13:09.122 --> 13:10.290
Yeah.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.382
Hmm.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.772
[thunder rumbling]

14:17.565 --> 14:19.442
[chattering on TV]

14:27.200 --> 14:28.535
What's in the satchel?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.244
[Llewelyn] It's full of money.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.455
That'll be the day.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.915
Where'd you get the pistol?

14:34.957 --> 14:35.916
At the getting place.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.670
Did you buy that gun?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.421
No. I found it.

14:42.841 --> 14:46.386
-Llewelyn.
-What? Quit your hollering.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.471
What'd you get for that thing?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.683
Well, you don't need to know
everything, Carla Jean.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.019
I need to know that.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.479
Keep running
that mouth of yours,

14:56.521 --> 14:58.523
I'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.400
Big talk.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.360
Keep it up.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.446
Fine. I don't want to know.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.824
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.744
That'll work.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.634
All right.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.637
[water running]

15:32.849 --> 15:35.017
-[Carla Jean] Llewelyn?
-Yeah?

15:37.437 --> 15:38.979
What're you doing, baby?

15:39.814 --> 15:41.274
[Llewelyn] I'm going out.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.942
[Carla Jean] Going where?

15:42.983 --> 15:45.904
A little something I forgot
to do, but I'll be back.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.155
And what're you gonna do?

15:48.197 --> 15:51.576
I'm fixing to do something
dumber than hell,
but I'm going anyways.

15:53.828 --> 15:56.163
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.375
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.548
Well, then I'll
tell her myself.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.467

20:59.258 --> 21:00.509
How much?

21:00.551 --> 21:01.510
69 cents.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.388
And the gas?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.473
Y'all getting any rain
up your way?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.102
What way would that be?

21:09.143 --> 21:11.145
Well, I seen
you was from Dallas.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.609
What business is it of yours
where I'm from,

21:18.111 --> 21:19.361
friendo?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.782
Well, I didn't mean
nothing by it.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.243
You didn't mean nothing?

21:25.284 --> 21:27.203
I was just passing the time.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.581
If you don't
want to accept that,

21:30.623 --> 21:32.625
I don't know what else
I can do for you.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.963
Will there be something else?

21:37.004 --> 21:38.881
I don't know.
Will there?

21:44.220 --> 21:45.638
[clears throat]

21:45.679 --> 21:46.847
Is something wrong?

21:46.889 --> 21:48.849
-With what?
-With anything.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.186
Is that what you're asking me?

21:52.228 --> 21:54.188
Is there something
wrong with anything?

21:54.230 --> 21:55.940
Will there be anything else?

21:55.982 --> 21:57.566
You already asked me that.

22:01.195 --> 22:03.781
Well, I need to see
about closing now.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.407
-See about closing?
-Yes, sir.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.742
What time do you close?

22:06.784 --> 22:08.035
Now. We close now.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.037
"Now" is not a time.
What time do you close?

22:10.079 --> 22:12.331
Generally around dark.
At dark.

22:15.626 --> 22:16.919
[sighs]

22:16.961 --> 22:18.838
You don't know what you're
talking about, do you?

22:18.879 --> 22:19.922
Sir?

22:21.215 --> 22:24.426
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.764
What time do you go to bed?

22:28.806 --> 22:29.890
Sir?

22:29.932 --> 22:31.600
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

22:31.642 --> 22:33.560
I said, what time
do you go to bed?

22:35.437 --> 22:36.438
Oh...

22:37.940 --> 22:41.568
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.196
I could come back then.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.698
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.074
Yeah, you said that.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.410
Well, I got to close now.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.621
You live in that
house out back?

22:54.248 --> 22:56.083
Yes, I do.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.417
You lived here all your life?

22:59.170 --> 23:02.673
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

23:03.007 --> 23:03.883
[scoffs]

23:05.634 --> 23:07.511
You married into it?

23:07.553 --> 23:10.430
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

23:11.682 --> 23:15.228
Raised a family there,
in Temple.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.855
We come out here
about four years ago.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.857
You married into it.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.359
If that's the way
you want to put it.

23:21.399 --> 23:24.402
Well, I don't have
some way to put it.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.072
That's the way it is.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.582
What's the most you ever
lost on a coin toss?

23:37.291 --> 23:38.376
Sir?

23:38.416 --> 23:41.503
The most you ever lost
on a coin toss.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.758
I don't know. I couldn't say.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.803
Call it.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.597
-Call it?
-Yes.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.682
-For what?
-Just call it.

23:56.352 --> 24:00.064
Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.690
You need to call it.

24:01.732 --> 24:05.361
I can't call it for you,
or it wouldn't be fair.

24:05.403 --> 24:06.737
I didn't put nothing up.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.614
Yes, you did.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.742
You've been putting it up
your whole life.
You just didn't know it.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.828
You know what date
is on this coin?

24:14.870 --> 24:15.788
No.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.748
1958.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.334
It's been traveling
22 years to get here.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.211
And now it's here.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.213
And it's either heads or tails.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.924
And you have to say. Call it.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.010
Well, look, I need to know
what I stand to win.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.262
Everything.

24:31.887 --> 24:32.888
How's that?

24:32.930 --> 24:35.433
You stand to win everything.
Call it.

24:39.770 --> 24:40.896
All right.

24:41.939 --> 24:42.940
Heads, then.

24:47.778 --> 24:48.988
Well done.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.075
Don't put it
in your pocket, sir.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.328
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.289
Where do you want me
to put it?

24:58.331 --> 25:00.624
Anywhere, not in your pocket.

25:00.666 --> 25:04.003
Or it'll get mixed in
with the others
and become just a coin.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.300
Which it is.

25:20.811 --> 25:21.854
Llewelyn?

25:24.773 --> 25:26.025
What the hell?

25:27.776 --> 25:29.320
[Llewelyn] The Odessa.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.155
Why would we go to Odessa?

25:31.197 --> 25:34.325
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.160
Well, how come?

25:36.202 --> 25:38.245
Look, right now
it's midnight, Sunday.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.164
The courthouse opens
nine hours from now.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.957
Someone's gonna be calling in
the vehicle number

25:41.999 --> 25:44.335
on the inspection plate
on my truck.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.544
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.088
But for how long
do we have to...

25:48.130 --> 25:49.673
Baby, at what point
would you quit bothering

25:49.715 --> 25:51.633
to look for your $2 million?

25:52.634 --> 25:54.887
What am I supposed
to tell Mama?

25:54.928 --> 25:56.472
Why don't you try
standing in the door

25:56.514 --> 25:57.890
and hollering,
"Mama, I'm home"?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.933
-Llewelyn...
-Come on, pack your things.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.144
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

26:04.104 --> 26:08.234
Well, don't fall
down apologizing.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.818
Baby, things happen.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.863
Come on,
I can't take them back.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.346
Mind riding bitch?

26:50.859 --> 26:52.819
-This his truck?
-Mmm-hmm.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.451
Got a screwgie?

27:01.912 --> 27:03.247
Who cut his tires?

27:03.289 --> 27:05.874
[man 1] Mexicans,
I guess. Wasn't us.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.002
That is a dead dog.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.170
[Chigurh] Yes, it is.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.134
Where's the receiver?

27:15.175 --> 27:16.802
I've got it.

27:16.843 --> 27:19.805
[sighs] These are
some ripe petunias.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.141
Hold this, please.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.567
Want it?

27:34.361 --> 27:36.113
[Chigurh] You getting
anything on this?

27:36.155 --> 27:37.239
[man 1] Not a bleep.

27:38.407 --> 27:39.450
All right.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.079
Give me that.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.841
I thought it was a car afire.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.301
It is a car afire.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.346
Wendell said there's something
in the back country, too.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.888
Step in there.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.932
When's the county gonna start
paying a rental on my horse?

28:03.974 --> 28:06.185
I love you more
and more every day.

28:06.226 --> 28:07.853
That's very nice.

28:08.895 --> 28:10.397
-Be careful.
-Always am.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.358
-Don't get hurt.
-Never do.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.526
Don't hurt no one.

28:13.567 --> 28:14.568
[snickers]

28:16.862 --> 28:18.113
If you say so.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.150
Wouldn't think
a car'd burn like that.

28:55.568 --> 28:56.443
Yes, sir.

28:57.528 --> 28:58.945
We should've brought wienies.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.740
That look like about a
'77 Ford to you, Wendell?

29:01.781 --> 29:02.908
It could be.

29:02.949 --> 29:05.244
I'd say it is.
Not a doubt in my mind.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.912
The old boy shot
by the highway?

29:06.953 --> 29:08.997
Yes, sir. His vehicle.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.001
Man killed Lamar's deputy,
took his car,

29:13.043 --> 29:14.628
killed that man on the highway,

29:14.670 --> 29:16.672
swapped for his car
and now here it is,

29:16.714 --> 29:19.216
and he's swapped again
for God knows what.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.927
That's very linear, Sheriff.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.472
Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.

29:25.514 --> 29:26.765
Yes, sir.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.308
Then there's this other.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.393
[Bell] Yup.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.854
You ride Winston.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.733
-You sure?
-Oh, I'm more than sure.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.651
If anything happens
to Loretta's horse out here,

29:37.693 --> 29:40.571
I can tell you right now,
I don't want to be
the party that was aboard.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.241
It's the same tire tread
coming back as going.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.992
Made about the same time, too.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.036
You can see
the sipes real clear.

29:50.330 --> 29:53.250
Somebody's pried
the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.836
I know this truck.

29:58.171 --> 30:00.466
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.675
[Wendell] Llewelyn Moss?

30:01.717 --> 30:03.594
[Bell] That's the boy.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.095
[Wendell] You figure him
for a dope runner?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.805
[Bell chuckles]
I don't know.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.099
I kindly doubt it.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.226
[Wendell]
OK Corral's just yonder.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.228
[flies buzzing]

30:13.270 --> 30:16.022
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

30:19.025 --> 30:21.487
Well, this is just a deal
gone wrong, isn't it?

30:21.528 --> 30:23.155
Yup.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.240
Appears to have been
a glitch or two.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.204
What calibers you
got there, Sheriff?

30:31.246 --> 30:32.372
9 millimeter.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.917
Couple of .45 ACPs.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.963
Somebody unloaded
on that thing with a shotgun.

30:42.758 --> 30:45.177
How come you reckon the
coyotes ain't been at them?

30:45.218 --> 30:46.261
[Bell] I don't know.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.978
Supposedly a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.938
These boys appear
to be managerial.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.818
I think we're looking at
more than one fracas.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.529
Execution here.
Wild west over there.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.407
It's that Mexican brown dope.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.868
Oh, these boys is all swole up.

31:09.909 --> 31:12.788
So, this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.581
Then, whoa, differences and...

31:15.915 --> 31:17.668
You know, might not even
have been no money.

31:17.710 --> 31:18.711
That's possible.

31:19.837 --> 31:20.962
But you don't believe it?

31:21.004 --> 31:22.381
[scoffs] No.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.883
Probably I don't.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.555
Well, it's a mess,
ain't it, Sheriff?

31:32.265 --> 31:34.560
If it ain't, it'll do
till the mess gets here.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.175
Yes, sir?

33:31.092 --> 33:33.303
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.221
Did you go up too his trailer?

33:35.263 --> 33:36.598
Yes, I did.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.141
Well, I'd say he's at work.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.935
Do you want to
leave a message?

33:39.977 --> 33:41.019
Where does he work?

33:41.060 --> 33:42.312
I can't say.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.900
Where does he work?

33:46.942 --> 33:50.570
Sir, I ain't at liberty
to give out no information
about our residents.

33:51.864 --> 33:52.865
Where does he work?

33:53.824 --> 33:56.034
Did you not hear me?

33:56.075 --> 33:59.120
We can't give out
no information.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.707
[toilet flushing]

34:21.476 --> 34:22.936
Why all the way to Del Rio?

34:22.978 --> 34:25.022
[Llewelyn] I'm gonna borrow
a car from Roberto.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.815
You can't afford one?

34:28.107 --> 34:29.526
I don't want to register it.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.319
Look, I'll call you
in a couple days.

34:31.361 --> 34:33.154
-Promise?
-Yes, I do.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.449
I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.703
Well, I got a good one,
so that ought to even out.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.788
Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

34:42.998 --> 34:43.957
Mama's gonna raise hell.

34:44.374 --> 34:45.417
Mmm-hmm.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.210
She's just gonna
cuss you up and down.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.170
Well, you should
be used to that.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.173
I'm used to lots of things.
I work at Wal-Mart.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.800
Not anymore, Carla Jean.

34:53.842 --> 34:55.719
You are retired.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.637
-Llewelyn?
-Yes, ma'am?

34:59.890 --> 35:01.641
You are coming back,
ain't you?

35:03.142 --> 35:04.185
I shall return.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.775
[knocking on door]

35:09.816 --> 35:10.901
Sheriff's Department!

35:13.528 --> 35:15.072
Look at that lock.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.034
We going in?

35:19.076 --> 35:20.285
Gun out and up.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.791
What about yours?

35:25.832 --> 35:27.250
[whispering]
I'm hiding behind you.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.838
Sheriff's Department!

35:58.531 --> 36:00.283
I believe they
done lit a shuck.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.827
I believe you're right.

36:01.868 --> 36:02.995
That from the lock?

36:03.662 --> 36:05.413
Probably must be.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.748
So, when was he here, Sheriff?

36:06.790 --> 36:08.041
I don't know. Oh.

36:09.459 --> 36:10.710
Now that's aggravating.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.004
Sheriff?

36:12.045 --> 36:13.672
Still sweating.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.758
Oh, Sheriff.
We just missed him!

36:18.718 --> 36:20.929
We gotta circulate
this on radio.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.348
All right.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.059
But what do we circulate?

36:28.895 --> 36:31.481
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

36:35.234 --> 36:37.863
Oh, Sheriff that's aggravating.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.447
I'm ahead of you there.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.786
You think this boy Moss
has got any notion

36:44.828 --> 36:46.746
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches
that are hunting him?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.456
I don't know. He ought to.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.004
He's seen the same
things I've seen,

36:54.046 --> 36:56.422
and it certainly
made an impression on me.

37:03.262 --> 37:04.472
Take me to a motel.

37:04.514 --> 37:05.557
Got one in mind?

37:05.598 --> 37:06.641
Someplace cheap.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.312
[clerk] You tell me the option.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.689
[Llewelyn] Do what, now?

37:12.731 --> 37:15.692
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.861
[clears throat]

37:17.903 --> 37:20.530
I'm just one person,
so it don't matter
the size of the bed.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.160
[phone ringing]

37:27.037 --> 37:28.914
[Roberto]<i> This is</i>
<i>Roberto's Automotive.</i>

37:28.955 --> 37:30.916
<i>I'm not in right now.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

39:24.570 --> 39:27.073
[phone ringing]

39:30.451 --> 39:31.452
[Carla Jean's mother]<i> Hello?</i>

39:32.620 --> 39:34.622
Is Llewelyn there?

39:34.664 --> 39:36.916
<i>Llewelyn? No, he ain't.</i>

39:38.251 --> 39:40.003
You expect him?

39:40.045 --> 39:42.172
<i>Now, why would I expect him?</i>

39:42.214 --> 39:43.422
<i>Who is this?</i>

39:51.639 --> 39:53.183
May I help you?

39:53.225 --> 39:56.269
Yeah, you got
a pair of Larry Mahans,
shoulder, size 11?

39:56.311 --> 39:57.562
I'll check.

39:57.603 --> 39:58.813
All right.
Y'all sell socks?

39:58.855 --> 39:59.898
Just white.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.483
Well, white's all
I wear. Bathroom?

40:28.551 --> 40:30.428
Don't stop.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.264
Just ride me up
past those rooms.

40:32.305 --> 40:33.848
[driver] What room?

40:33.890 --> 40:35.850
Just drive me around.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.602
I wanna see if someone's here.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.946
Keep going. Don't stop.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.782
[driver] I don't wanna
get into some kind of
a jackpot here, buddy.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.784
[Llewelyn] It's all right.

40:52.825 --> 40:55.912
Why don't I just
set you down right here
and we won't argue about it?

40:56.996 --> 40:58.373
Take me to another motel.

40:58.415 --> 41:00.208
[driver] Let's just
call it square.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.751
Look, you're already
in the jackpot,

41:01.793 --> 41:03.169
and I'm trying to
get you out of it.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.879
Take me to another motel.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.210
[gun fires]

41:44.252 --> 41:46.254
[cawing]

41:54.471 --> 41:56.973
The lab reports from Austin
on that blood by the highway.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.975
-What was the bullet?
-There wasn't no bullet.

42:00.685 --> 42:01.727
Wasn't no bullet?

42:01.769 --> 42:03.313
Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.690
Well, Wendell,

42:05.731 --> 42:08.693
with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

42:09.402 --> 42:10.778
No, sir.

42:10.820 --> 42:14.615
You said entry wound
in the forehead,
no exit wound.

42:14.657 --> 42:15.825
Yes, sir.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.452
You telling me he shot
this boy in the head

42:17.494 --> 42:19.371
and then went
digging around in there
with a pocket knife?

42:21.080 --> 42:22.540
Well, sir,
I don't wanna picture that.

42:22.581 --> 42:23.916
I don't, either.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.169
Can I freshen that there
for you, Sheriff?

42:26.211 --> 42:28.921
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.507
Rangers and the DEA
are headed back

42:30.548 --> 42:32.467
out to the scene this morning.

42:32.509 --> 42:33.634
You gonna join 'em?

42:34.844 --> 42:36.762
Any new bodies
accumulate out there?

42:38.639 --> 42:39.640
No, sir.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.351
Well, then I guess
I can skip it.

42:46.772 --> 42:48.358
[sighing]

42:56.241 --> 42:58.451
12 gauge. Need shells?

42:58.493 --> 43:00.619
Yeah, double-ought.

43:00.661 --> 43:02.621
Yeah,
that'll give you a wallop.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.499
Y'all got camping supplies?

43:04.541 --> 43:06.543
-Tent poles.
-Mmm-hmm.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.835
You already have the tent?

43:07.877 --> 43:09.754
Well, something like that.

43:09.795 --> 43:12.465
Well, you give me
the model number on the tent,
I can order you the poles.

43:12.507 --> 43:13.966
Oh, never mind.
I want a tent.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.009
Well, what kind of tent?

43:15.760 --> 43:17.095
The kind with most poles.

43:39.367 --> 43:40.577
Could I get another room?

43:40.618 --> 43:42.370
You wanna change rooms?

43:42.412 --> 43:44.789
No, ma'am,
I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.416
Another additional?

43:46.458 --> 43:47.500
Yes, ma'am.

43:47.542 --> 43:50.002
And do you have
a map of the rooms?

43:50.044 --> 43:52.464
Well, yeah,
we had a sort of one.

43:54.507 --> 43:55.800
Oh, thank you.

43:59.929 --> 44:01.973
How about 38?

44:02.014 --> 44:05.810
Well, you can have the one
right next to yours
if you want, number 137.

44:05.851 --> 44:07.061
It ain't took.

44:07.103 --> 44:08.896
No, 38 will be fine.

44:08.938 --> 44:10.773
That's got two double beds.

How'd you find that?

50:48.713 --> 50:50.006
[speaking Spanish]

50:54.176 --> 50:55.386
[gun fires]

52:35.151 --> 52:37.153
You shouldn't be doing that.

52:38.030 --> 52:39.991
Even a young man like you.

52:41.533 --> 52:42.827
Doing what?

52:44.078 --> 52:45.079
Hitchhiking.

52:51.043 --> 52:52.377
Dangerous.

52:55.673 --> 52:57.633
[elevator bell dinging]

53:10.855 --> 53:14.441
You know Anton Chigurh
by sight, is that correct?

53:14.483 --> 53:16.819
Yes, sir,
I know him every which way.

53:17.945 --> 53:19.947
When did you last see him?

53:20.280 --> 53:21.824
Uh...

53:21.866 --> 53:25.452
November 28th, last year.

53:25.494 --> 53:29.165
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

53:29.205 --> 53:31.375
No, sir, but you
struck me as a man

53:31.416 --> 53:33.293
who wouldn't wanna
waste a chair.

53:33.335 --> 53:35.838
I remember dates,
names, numbers.

53:35.880 --> 53:38.049
I saw him November the 28th.

53:41.010 --> 53:42.845
Got a loose cannon here.

53:42.887 --> 53:46.182
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party
is out his product.

53:46.222 --> 53:47.808
Yes, sir.

53:47.850 --> 53:51.812
This account will
only give up $1,200
in any 24-hour period.

53:51.854 --> 53:53.981
That's up from $1,000.

53:54.023 --> 53:56.859
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

53:58.027 --> 54:00.154
Okay.

54:00.196 --> 54:02.614
Just how well
do you know Chigurh?

54:02.656 --> 54:04.240
What do you wanna know?

54:04.282 --> 54:06.994
I just wanna know your opinion
of him, in general.

54:07.953 --> 54:10.414
Just how dangerous is he?

54:10.455 --> 54:13.249
Compared to what,
the bubonic plague?

54:13.291 --> 54:15.586
He's bad enough
you called me.

54:15.627 --> 54:19.715
Yeah, he's a psychopathic
killer, but so what?

54:19.757 --> 54:22.093
There's plenty of them around.

54:22.134 --> 54:24.803
Killed three men in a
Del Rio motel yesterday,

54:24.845 --> 54:28.390
and two others in that colossal
goat fuck out in the desert.

54:28.432 --> 54:29.975
We can stop that.

54:30.017 --> 54:31.393
Seem pretty sure of yourself.

54:33.854 --> 54:37.566
You've led something
of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr. Wells?

54:38.150 --> 54:40.111
In all honesty,

54:40.152 --> 54:42.696
I can't say that charm has had
a whole lot to do with it.

54:45.116 --> 54:46.491
I was wondering...

54:46.533 --> 54:47.451
Yes?

54:48.660 --> 54:50.537
Could you validate
my parking ticket?

54:53.082 --> 54:55.960
An attempt at humor,
I suppose?

54:56.001 --> 54:57.044
I'm sorry.

55:02.133 --> 55:04.260
You know, I...

55:04.300 --> 55:06.845
Counted the floors to this
building from the street.

55:07.471 --> 55:08.472
And?

55:08.513 --> 55:09.890
There's one missing.

55:12.935 --> 55:14.228
We'll look into it.

55:34.581 --> 55:37.751
One room. One night.

55:37.793 --> 55:40.004
-That'll be $26.
-[cat meowing]

55:40.045 --> 55:41.588
All righty.

55:45.301 --> 55:46.718
You on all night?

55:46.760 --> 55:49.345
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.975
This here's for you.

55:53.017 --> 55:56.228
Now, I ain't asking you
to do anything illegal.

55:56.270 --> 55:58.063
There's someone
who been looking for me.

55:58.105 --> 55:59.439
Not police.

55:59.481 --> 56:01.900
You just call me if anyone
else checks in tonight.

56:01.942 --> 56:04.069
And by anyone,
I mean any swinging dick.

56:26.342 --> 56:27.634
[keys clinking]

56:46.737 --> 56:48.322

1:02:26.451 --> 1:02:28.995
Don't worry,
I ain't gonna hurt you.

1:02:29.037 --> 1:02:30.872
I need you to
drive me on out of here.

[man 1] Why not?

1:05:39.394 --> 1:05:40.562
[man 2] I don't know, man.

1:05:40.604 --> 1:05:42.814
Could you have stayed...

1:05:52.824 --> 1:05:53.867
[grunts]

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:05.921
Were you in a car accident?

1:06:07.923 --> 1:06:10.258
I'll give you 500 bucks
for that coat.

1:06:12.176 --> 1:06:13.720
Let me see the money.

1:06:16.097 --> 1:06:17.682
Were you in a car accident?

1:06:19.810 --> 1:06:21.060
Yeah.

1:06:21.102 --> 1:06:22.437
Okay, give me the money.

1:06:22.479 --> 1:06:24.689
It's right here.
Give me the clothes.

1:06:24.731 --> 1:06:26.357
Let him hold the money.

1:06:33.364 --> 1:06:34.825
Now give it here.

1:06:42.791 --> 1:06:44.459
Give me that beer, too.

1:06:46.711 --> 1:06:47.879
How much?

1:06:48.922 --> 1:06:50.465
Brian, give him the beer.

1:13:10.970 --> 1:13:13.472
Any word on those
vehicles yet?

1:13:13.514 --> 1:13:16.475
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

1:13:16.517 --> 1:13:19.687
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to
deceased people.

1:13:20.980 --> 1:13:23.399
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:25.902
Do you want me to see
what I can find out
about the Mexican ones?

1:13:25.943 --> 1:13:27.444
No. Lord, no.

1:13:28.612 --> 1:13:31.615
There's this month's checks.

1:13:31.657 --> 1:13:34.577
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

1:13:34.618 --> 1:13:37.205
Gonna try to keep from it
much as I can.

1:13:37.247 --> 1:13:38.706
He's going back out there.

1:13:38.748 --> 1:13:40.333
Wanted to know if you
wanted to go with him.

1:13:40.375 --> 1:13:41.709
That's cordial of him.

1:13:42.919 --> 1:13:44.837
Can I get you
to call Loretta for me,

1:13:44.879 --> 1:13:47.715
tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

1:13:47.757 --> 1:13:49.092
Yes, Sheriff.

1:13:49.133 --> 1:13:50.968
I'll call her when I get done.

1:13:51.010 --> 1:13:53.888
I'd call her now,
but if she want me
to come home, I just might.

1:13:53.930 --> 1:13:55.765
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

1:13:55.806 --> 1:13:57.516
Uh-huh.

1:13:57.558 --> 1:14:00.103
You don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

1:14:04.107 --> 1:14:07.277
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

1:14:07.318 --> 1:14:10.321
Oh, we dedicate
ourselves daily anew.

1:14:10.363 --> 1:14:11.655
Something like that.

1:14:11.697 --> 1:14:14.200
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

1:14:14.242 --> 1:14:17.120
Might come to three times
before it's over with.

1:14:18.329 --> 1:14:19.872
Now, what the hell?

1:14:20.831 --> 1:14:22.333
[police siren sounds]

1:14:28.672 --> 1:14:29.840
Sheriff?

1:14:30.925 --> 1:14:32.468
You looked at your load lately?

1:14:34.304 --> 1:14:36.513
That is a damn outrage.

1:14:36.555 --> 1:14:38.933
[chuckling] One of those
tie-downs worked loose.

1:14:38.975 --> 1:14:41.060
How many bodies
did you leave with?

1:14:41.102 --> 1:14:42.937
I ain't lost none
of 'em, Sheriff.

1:14:44.355 --> 1:14:46.816
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

1:14:46.857 --> 1:14:49.193
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

1:14:49.235 --> 1:14:51.737
You gonna write me up for
improperly secured load on me?

1:14:51.779 --> 1:14:53.197
You get your ass out of here.

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:58.535
[clattering]

1:14:58.577 --> 1:15:00.663
[greeting in Spanish]

1:15:00.704 --> 1:15:03.833
I'm guessing this isn't the
future you had pictured
for yourself

1:15:03.874 --> 1:15:07.128
when you first clapped
eyes on that money.

1:15:07.170 --> 1:15:09.588
Don't worry. I'm not
the man who's after you.

1:15:11.048 --> 1:15:12.216
I know that.

1:15:14.385 --> 1:15:15.928
I've seen him.

1:15:15.970 --> 1:15:18.681
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

1:15:19.890 --> 1:15:21.517
Hmm.

1:15:21.558 --> 1:15:23.978
What's this guy supposed
to be, the ultimate badass?

1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:26.022
I don't think that's how
I'd describe him.

1:15:26.063 --> 1:15:28.107
How would you describe him?

1:15:28.149 --> 1:15:32.528
I guess I'd say he doesn't
have a sense of humor.

1:15:32.569 --> 1:15:33.988
His name's Chigurh.

1:15:34.030 --> 1:15:35.072
Sugar?

1:15:35.114 --> 1:15:37.783
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

1:15:37.825 --> 1:15:39.452
You know how he found you?

1:15:39.494 --> 1:15:41.037
Yeah, I know how he found me.

1:15:41.078 --> 1:15:42.497
It's called a transponder.

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:44.290
I know what it's called.

1:15:44.332 --> 1:15:45.916
He won't find me again.

1:15:45.958 --> 1:15:48.252
-Not that way.
-Not any way.

1:15:48.294 --> 1:15:49.920
Took me about three hours.

1:15:49.962 --> 1:15:51.672
Yeah, well, I been immobile.

1:15:51.714 --> 1:15:54.342
No. You don't understand.

1:15:57.011 --> 1:15:58.179
What do you do?

1:15:59.222 --> 1:16:00.264
I'm retired.

1:16:00.306 --> 1:16:01.891
What did you do?

1:16:01.932 --> 1:16:03.059
Welder.

1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:04.560
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

1:16:04.601 --> 1:16:06.770
Any of it. If it can
be welded, I can weld it.

1:16:06.812 --> 1:16:08.814
-Cast iron?
-Yeah.

1:16:08.856 --> 1:16:09.982
I don't mean braze.

1:16:10.024 --> 1:16:11.275
I didn't say braze.

1:16:11.317 --> 1:16:13.027
-Pot metal?
-What did I say?

1:16:15.071 --> 1:16:16.572
Were you in Nam?

1:16:18.241 --> 1:16:19.700
Yeah, I was in Nam.

1:16:21.702 --> 1:16:23.579
So was I.

1:16:23.620 --> 1:16:25.581
So what does that make me,
your buddy?

1:16:27.750 --> 1:16:30.378
Look, you gotta
give me this money.

1:16:30.420 --> 1:16:33.339
I got no other reason
to protect you.

1:16:33.381 --> 1:16:35.883
[groans] It's too late.
I spent it.

1:16:37.801 --> 1:16:39.929
About a million-and-a-half
on whores and whisky,

1:16:39.970 --> 1:16:42.681
and the rest of it,
I just sort of blew it in.

1:16:44.767 --> 1:16:47.061
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

1:16:51.441 --> 1:16:53.109
Why would he go to Odessa?

1:16:54.026 --> 1:16:55.152
Kill your wife.

1:17:02.743 --> 1:17:05.496
Maybe he's the one
who needs to be worried

1:17:05.955 --> 1:17:07.164
about me.

1:17:07.206 --> 1:17:08.541
He isn't.

1:17:09.083 --> 1:17:10.460
[scoffs] Yeah.

1:17:10.501 --> 1:17:12.420
You're not cut out for this.

1:17:12.462 --> 1:17:15.881
You're just a guy who happened
to find those vehicles.

1:17:21.971 --> 1:17:24.599
I'm across the river
at the Hotel Eagle.

1:17:25.141 --> 1:17:26.601
Carson Wells.

1:17:27.726 --> 1:17:29.562
Call me when you've had enough.

1:17:29.604 --> 1:17:32.648
I'm gonna even let you
keep a little of the money.

1:17:32.689 --> 1:17:34.066
If I was into cutting deals,

1:17:34.108 --> 1:17:36.152
why wouldn't I just deal
with this guy Sugar?

1:17:36.193 --> 1:17:38.821
[chuckles] Oh, no, no,
you don't understand.

1:17:38.862 --> 1:17:40.615
You can't make a deal with him.

1:17:40.656 --> 1:17:42.325
Even if you gave him
the money back,

1:17:42.366 --> 1:17:45.953
he'd still kill you
just for inconveniencing him.

1:17:45.995 --> 1:17:47.704
He's a peculiar man.

1:17:47.746 --> 1:17:49.748
Might even say
he has principles.

1:17:49.790 --> 1:17:54.253
Principles that transcend
money or drugs or anything
like that.

1:17:55.379 --> 1:17:56.672
Not like you.

1:17:57.548 --> 1:17:59.925
Yeah. He's not even like me.

1:17:59.967 --> 1:18:02.261
No, he don't talk
as much as you.

1:18:02.303 --> 1:18:03.554
I give him points for that.

1:18:06.474 --> 1:18:08.809
Carla Jean,
thank you for coming.

1:18:08.851 --> 1:18:10.769
Don't know why I did.

1:18:10.811 --> 1:18:13.606
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

1:18:13.648 --> 1:18:14.898
You haven't heard from him?

1:18:14.940 --> 1:18:15.899
No, I ain't.

1:18:15.941 --> 1:18:17.734
-Nothing?
-Not word one.

1:18:17.776 --> 1:18:19.529
Would you tell me if you had?

1:18:19.570 --> 1:18:22.865
Well, I don't know.

1:18:22.906 --> 1:18:24.617
He don't need
any trouble from you.

1:18:24.659 --> 1:18:26.994
It ain't me
he's in trouble with.

1:18:27.036 --> 1:18:28.579
Who's he in trouble with, then?

1:18:28.621 --> 1:18:31.207
Some pretty bad people.

1:18:31.248 --> 1:18:34.335
These people will kill him,
Carla Jean. They won't quit.

1:18:34.377 --> 1:18:37.254
He won't, neither.
He never has.

1:18:38.297 --> 1:18:39.882
He can take all comers.

1:18:40.633 --> 1:18:43.260
[sighing]

1:18:43.302 --> 1:18:46.722
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out
east of Sanderson?

1:18:48.765 --> 1:18:51.268
Well, you know how he used
to slaughter beeves,

1:18:51.310 --> 1:18:52.978
hit 'em right there
with a maul,

1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:54.855
truss 'em up
and slit their throats?

1:18:54.897 --> 1:18:57.733
You know, Charlie's
got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him,

1:18:57.774 --> 1:19:01.278
and the beef comes to,
starts thrashing around.

1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:04.114
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

1:19:04.156 --> 1:19:06.450
You'll excuse the... Well.

1:19:06.492 --> 1:19:09.203
Charlie grabs a gun there,
shoot the damn thing
in the head,

1:19:09.245 --> 1:19:12.164
but with all the swinging
and the thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

1:19:12.206 --> 1:19:15.084
Ricochets around, comes back,
hits Charlie in the shoulder.

1:19:15.125 --> 1:19:19.129
You go see Charlie,
he still can't pick up
his right hand for his hat.

1:19:19.171 --> 1:19:23.008
The point being that
even in the contest
between man and steer,

1:19:23.050 --> 1:19:24.677
the issue is not certain.

1:19:32.727 --> 1:19:36.522
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him
I'd make him safe.

1:19:40.984 --> 1:19:42.445
[sighing]

1:19:42.486 --> 1:19:45.197
Course, they slaughter steers
a lot different these days.

1:19:45.822 --> 1:19:47.533
Use a air gun.

1:19:47.575 --> 1:19:50.035
Shoots out a little rod about
that far into the brain.

1:19:50.077 --> 1:19:52.705
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows
what hit him.

1:19:56.041 --> 1:19:57.710
Why are you
telling me that, Sheriff?

1:19:58.294 --> 1:19:59.712
I don't know.

1:20:03.549 --> 1:20:04.925
My mind wanders.

1:21:28.676 --> 1:21:30.052
Hello, Carson.

1:21:33.055 --> 1:21:34.348
Let's go to your room.

1:21:46.902 --> 1:21:48.945
You don't have to do this.

1:21:49.488 --> 1:21:51.990
I'm a day trader.

1:21:52.032 --> 1:21:53.576
I could just go home.

1:21:55.494 --> 1:21:56.662
You could.

1:21:56.704 --> 1:22:00.290
Make it worth your while,
take you to an ATM

1:22:00.332 --> 1:22:02.793
with 14 grand in it.

1:22:02.835 --> 1:22:04.920
And everybody just walks away.

1:22:06.463 --> 1:22:07.715
An ATM?

1:22:12.678 --> 1:22:15.514
I know where the satchel is.

1:22:15.556 --> 1:22:18.016
If you knew,
you would have it with you.

1:22:18.058 --> 1:22:20.102
I can find it
from the river bank.

1:22:20.143 --> 1:22:21.771
I know where it is.

1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:25.566
I know something better.

1:22:25.608 --> 1:22:27.818
-What's that?
-I know where it's going to be.

1:22:29.612 --> 1:22:30.946
Where's that?

1:22:30.987 --> 1:22:32.907
It will be brought to me,

1:22:33.990 --> 1:22:35.576
and placed at my feet.

1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:39.496
You don't know to a certainty.

1:22:40.581 --> 1:22:42.666
In 20 minutes it could be here.

1:22:42.708 --> 1:22:44.668
I do know to a certainty.

1:22:44.710 --> 1:22:47.170
And you know what's gonna
happen now, Carson?

1:22:48.338 --> 1:22:51.007
You should admit
your situation.

1:22:51.049 --> 1:22:53.302
There would be
more dignity in it.

1:22:58.181 --> 1:22:59.475
You go to hell.

1:22:59.516 --> 1:23:00.684
Hmm.

1:23:01.852 --> 1:23:04.480
All right.
Let me ask you something.

1:23:06.982 --> 1:23:08.984
If the rule you followed

1:23:09.735 --> 1:23:11.487
brought you to this,

1:23:12.529 --> 1:23:14.239
of what use was the rule?

1:23:19.995 --> 1:23:23.666
Do you have any idea
how crazy you are?

1:23:25.208 --> 1:23:27.711
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

1:23:27.753 --> 1:23:29.421
I mean the nature of you.

1:23:33.968 --> 1:23:35.093
You...

1:23:36.303 --> 1:23:39.431
You can have the money, Anton.

1:23:42.601 --> 1:23:45.061
[phone ringing]

1:23:47.731 --> 1:23:50.776
[phone continues ringing]

1:23:57.324 --> 1:23:58.325
[grunts]

1:24:02.705 --> 1:24:05.332
[phone repeatedly ringing]

1:24:19.805 --> 1:24:21.682
-[Llewelyn]<i> Hello?</i>
-Yes?

1:24:23.851 --> 1:24:26.395
<i>Is Carson Wells there?</i>

1:24:29.314 --> 1:24:31.483
Not in the sense that you mean.

1:24:34.028 --> 1:24:36.154
<i>You need to come see me.</i>

1:24:36.196 --> 1:24:37.907
Who is this?

1:24:37.948 --> 1:24:39.533
You know who it is.

1:24:41.076 --> 1:24:42.953
You need to talk to me.

1:24:42.995 --> 1:24:44.371
<i>I don't need to talk to you.</i>

1:24:44.413 --> 1:24:45.748
I think you do.

1:24:46.749 --> 1:24:49.292
Do you know where I'm going?

1:24:49.334 --> 1:24:51.127
Why would I care
where you're going?

1:24:51.169 --> 1:24:52.880
I know where you are.

1:24:54.048 --> 1:24:56.091
<i>Yeah? Where am I?</i>

1:24:56.132 --> 1:24:58.260
You're in the hospital
across the river,

1:24:58.301 --> 1:25:00.262
but that's not where I'm going.

1:25:01.430 --> 1:25:03.223
Do you know where I'm going?

1:25:05.434 --> 1:25:07.185
<i>Yeah, I know</i>
<i>where you're going.</i>

1:25:07.227 --> 1:25:08.270
All right.

1:25:09.438 --> 1:25:10.940
<i>You know she won't be there.</i>

1:25:10.981 --> 1:25:13.442
It doesn't make any
difference where she is.

1:25:13.483 --> 1:25:15.277
So, what're you
going up there for?

1:25:19.489 --> 1:25:21.825
You know how this is gonna
turn out, don't you?

1:25:23.953 --> 1:25:25.079
Nope.

1:25:26.162 --> 1:25:28.082
I think you do.

1:25:28.123 --> 1:25:30.751
So, this is what I'll offer.

1:25:30.793 --> 1:25:34.212
You bring me the money
and I'll let her go.

1:25:34.254 --> 1:25:37.507
<i>Otherwise, she's accountable,</i>
<i>the same as you.</i>

1:25:40.218 --> 1:25:42.638
That's the best deal
you're gonna get.

1:25:42.679 --> 1:25:46.349
I won't tell you
you can save yourself,
because you can't.

1:25:49.937 --> 1:25:53.398
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you
something, all right.

1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:55.484
I've decided to make you
a special project of mine.

1:25:55.525 --> 1:25:58.028
You ain't gonna have to come
look for me at all.

1:26:02.616 --> 1:26:03.742
[Bell]<i> The motel in Del Rio?</i>

1:26:04.118 --> 1:26:05.285
Yes, sir.

1:26:05.327 --> 1:26:07.162
None of the three
had ID on them,

1:26:07.203 --> 1:26:09.331
but they're telling me
that all three is Mexicans.

1:26:09.372 --> 1:26:10.833
Was Mexicans.

1:26:10.874 --> 1:26:15.170
There's a question, whether
they stopped being and when.

1:26:17.798 --> 1:26:19.758
Yes, sir.

1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:22.177
Now, Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

1:26:22.218 --> 1:26:24.179
Yes, sir.
It was punched out.

1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:25.221
Okay.

1:26:26.348 --> 1:26:27.599
You wanna drive out there?

1:26:27.641 --> 1:26:29.101
Naw, that's all
I had to look for,

1:26:29.143 --> 1:26:31.478
and it sound like these old
boys died of natural causes.

1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:32.813
How's that, Sheriff?

1:26:32.855 --> 1:26:34.940
Natural to the line
of work they was in.

1:26:34.982 --> 1:26:36.108
Yes, sir.

1:26:36.150 --> 1:26:38.485
My God, Wendell,
it's just all-out war.

1:26:38.527 --> 1:26:40.112
I can't think of
any other word for it.

1:26:40.154 --> 1:26:42.531
Who are these people?

1:26:42.572 --> 1:26:45.993
Here, last week, they found
this couple out in California.

1:26:46.035 --> 1:26:47.911
They rent out rooms
to old people,

1:26:47.953 --> 1:26:50.080
kill them,
bury them in the yard,

1:26:50.122 --> 1:26:52.124
cash their
Social Security checks.

1:26:53.333 --> 1:26:56.336
They'd torture them first.
I don't know why.

1:26:57.713 --> 1:27:00.507
Maybe their television
set was broke.

1:27:00.549 --> 1:27:04.302
And this went on until...
Here, I quote.

1:27:04.344 --> 1:27:06.805
"Neighbors were alerted when
a man ran from the premises

1:27:06.847 --> 1:27:08.724
wearing only a dog collar."

1:27:10.934 --> 1:27:14.604
You can't make up
such a thing as that.
I dare you to even try.

1:27:14.646 --> 1:27:17.941
But that's what it took,
you notice, to get
somebody's attention.

1:27:17.983 --> 1:27:20.485
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

1:27:20.527 --> 1:27:21.570
[laughs]

1:27:27.283 --> 1:27:30.370
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

1:27:33.082 --> 1:27:34.917
Ain't a whole lot else
you can do.

1:27:37.753 --> 1:27:39.671
Tell me something.

1:27:39.713 --> 1:27:42.632
Who do you think
gets through this gate into
the United States of America?

1:27:44.551 --> 1:27:47.012
I don't know.
American citizens?

1:27:47.054 --> 1:27:48.680
Some American citizens.

1:27:48.722 --> 1:27:50.891
-Who do you think decides?
-You do, I reckon.

1:27:50.933 --> 1:27:53.060
That is correct.
How do I decide?

1:27:54.019 --> 1:27:55.687
-I don't know.
-I ask questions.

1:27:55.729 --> 1:27:57.313
And if I get sensible answers,

1:27:57.355 --> 1:27:58.648
then they get to go to America.

1:27:58.690 --> 1:28:00.192
And if I don't get sensible
answers, they don't.

1:28:00.234 --> 1:28:01.693
Anything about that
you don't understand?

1:28:01.735 --> 1:28:03.195
-No, sir.
-Then I ask you again,

1:28:03.237 --> 1:28:04.738
how you come to be out here
with no clothes?

1:28:06.489 --> 1:28:09.243
Well, I got an overcoat on.

1:28:09.284 --> 1:28:10.869
-Are you jacking with me?
-Oh, no, sir.

1:28:10.911 --> 1:28:12.537
-Don't jack with me.
-Yes, sir.

1:28:13.580 --> 1:28:14.706
You in the service?

1:28:14.748 --> 1:28:15.958
No, sir, I'm a veteran.

1:28:15.999 --> 1:28:17.042
Nam?

1:28:17.084 --> 1:28:18.585
Yes, sir, two tours.

1:28:18.627 --> 1:28:20.129
What outfit?

1:28:20.170 --> 1:28:24.716
Twelfth Infantry Battalion,
August 7, 1966, July 2, 1968.

1:28:27.427 --> 1:28:29.012
-Wilson.
-Yes, sir?

1:28:31.098 --> 1:28:32.474
Get someone to help this man.

1:28:32.515 --> 1:28:33.809
He needs to get into town.

1:28:43.068 --> 1:28:44.778
How those Larry's holding up?

1:28:44.820 --> 1:28:47.656
Oh. Good, good.
I need everything else.

1:28:47.697 --> 1:28:49.825
Okay.

1:28:49.866 --> 1:28:52.828
You have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

1:28:52.869 --> 1:28:54.871
No, sir. It's unusual.

1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:10.428
[Carla Jean's mother]
<i>She don't want to talk to you.</i>

1:29:10.470 --> 1:29:11.638
Yes, she does. Put her on.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:12.806
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

1:29:12.848 --> 1:29:14.183
I don't care what time it is,

1:29:14.224 --> 1:29:16.518
and don't you
hang up this phone.

1:29:16.559 --> 1:29:19.395
<i>Discombobulated by</i>
<i>a no-account son-in-law.</i>

1:29:20.939 --> 1:29:22.899
-Llewelyn?
<i>-Hey, you.</i>

1:29:22.941 --> 1:29:24.943
What should I do?

1:29:24.985 --> 1:29:26.486
<i>You know what's going on?</i>

1:29:26.528 --> 1:29:29.906
I don't know. I had the sheriff
here from Terrell County.

1:29:29.948 --> 1:29:31.158
What'd you tell him?

1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:33.035
<i>What did I know to tell him?</i>

1:29:33.994 --> 1:29:35.704
<i>You're hurt, ain't you?</i>

1:29:35.745 --> 1:29:37.372
[chuckles]

1:29:37.413 --> 1:29:39.582
What makes you say that?

1:29:39.624 --> 1:29:41.293
<i>I can hear it in your voice.</i>

1:29:41.335 --> 1:29:43.170
[Carla Jean's mother]
<i>There is falseness</i>
<i>in his voice.</i>

1:29:43.212 --> 1:29:46.965
Well, look, I want you
to meet me at the Desert Sands
Motel in El Paso.

1:29:47.007 --> 1:29:49.343
Because I'm gonna
give you the money,
I'm gonna put you on a plane.

1:29:49.383 --> 1:29:52.012
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

1:29:52.054 --> 1:29:53.763
No, look, this works better.

1:29:53.805 --> 1:29:55.932
With you gone and I don't have
the money, he can't touch me,

1:29:55.974 --> 1:29:58.018
but I can sure touch him.

1:29:58.060 --> 1:30:00.312
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

1:30:00.812 --> 1:30:02.647
<i>Find who?</i>

1:30:02.689 --> 1:30:04.233
<i>What am I supposed</i>
<i>to do with mother?</i>

1:30:04.274 --> 1:30:06.484
-She'll be all right.
<i>-She'll be all right?</i>

1:30:06.526 --> 1:30:08.820
[Carla Jean's mother]
<i>Be all right.</i>
<i>I got the cancer.</i>

1:30:08.862 --> 1:30:10.822
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

1:30:34.263 --> 1:30:36.265
[gurgling]

1:30:43.730 --> 1:30:44.731
Hmm.

1:30:45.399 --> 1:30:46.775
Who are you?

1:30:51.445 --> 1:30:53.156
-Me?
-Yes.

1:30:53.198 --> 1:30:54.366
Nobody.

1:30:55.617 --> 1:30:56.826
Accounting.

1:30:58.745 --> 1:31:00.830
He gave the Mexicans
a receiver.

1:31:03.583 --> 1:31:04.667
He feels...

1:31:05.585 --> 1:31:07.129
He felt that

1:31:07.921 --> 1:31:09.047
the more people looking...

1:31:09.089 --> 1:31:10.173
That's foolish.

1:31:11.049 --> 1:31:12.926
You pick the one right tool.

1:31:14.468 --> 1:31:15.511
[man] I see.

1:31:18.514 --> 1:31:20.016
Are you going to shoot me?

1:31:26.440 --> 1:31:27.899
That depends.

1:31:30.652 --> 1:31:32.112
Do you see me?

1:31:35.407 --> 1:31:37.951
[Carla Jean's mother]
I always seen this is
what it'd come to.

1:31:37.993 --> 1:31:40.536
Three years ago,
I pre-visioned it.

1:31:40.578 --> 1:31:42.456
It ain't even three years
we been married.

1:31:42.496 --> 1:31:47.002
Three years ago I said them
very words. "No" and "good."

1:31:47.043 --> 1:31:50.339
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

1:31:50.380 --> 1:31:53.507
I got the cancer
and look at this,

1:31:53.549 --> 1:31:55.677
not even my home to go to.

1:31:56.636 --> 1:31:59.389
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

1:31:59.431 --> 1:32:02.600
You know how many people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

1:32:02.642 --> 1:32:03.810
[driver] No, ma'am.

1:32:03.852 --> 1:32:05.312
That's how many.

1:32:07.647 --> 1:32:09.316
[man speaking in Spanish]

1:32:14.363 --> 1:32:16.156
I didn't see my prednisone.

1:32:16.198 --> 1:32:17.615
I put it in, Mama.

1:32:17.657 --> 1:32:18.908
Well, I didn't see it.

1:32:18.950 --> 1:32:21.577
Well, I put it in that one.

1:32:21.619 --> 1:32:23.246
You just set there.

1:32:23.288 --> 1:32:25.374
I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

1:32:25.415 --> 1:32:27.750
You need help
with the bags, madam?

1:32:27.792 --> 1:32:31.545
Well, thank God, there is one
gentleman left in west Texas.

1:32:31.587 --> 1:32:34.299
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well.

1:32:34.341 --> 1:32:36.134
Which bus are you taking?

1:32:36.176 --> 1:32:39.221
Going to El Paso,
don't ask me why.

1:32:39.262 --> 1:32:42.140
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

1:32:42.182 --> 1:32:44.851
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

1:32:46.186 --> 1:32:48.146
[Bell]<i> Carla Jean,</i>
<i>how are you?</i>

1:32:48.188 --> 1:32:52.150
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

1:32:52.192 --> 1:32:53.609
<i>Who's Charlie Walser?</i>

1:32:54.194 --> 1:32:55.404
Uh, oh...

1:32:57.406 --> 1:32:59.615
True story. I couldn't swear
to every detail,

1:32:59.657 --> 1:33:01.659
but it's certainly true
it is a story.

1:33:01.701 --> 1:33:03.036
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

1:33:03.078 --> 1:33:06.998
Sheriff, can you give me your
word on something?

1:33:07.040 --> 1:33:09.000
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1:33:09.042 --> 1:33:12.087
If I tell you where
Llewelyn's headed,

1:33:12.128 --> 1:33:15.382
you promise it'll be just you
who goes and talks with him?

1:33:15.424 --> 1:33:17.259
You and nobody else.

1:33:17.300 --> 1:33:18.968
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1:33:19.010 --> 1:33:20.845
<i>Llewelyn would</i>
<i>never ask for help.</i>

1:33:21.846 --> 1:33:23.932
He never thinks he needs any.

1:33:23.973 --> 1:33:26.351
<i>Carla Jean,</i>
<i>I will not harm your man.</i>

1:33:27.977 --> 1:33:30.772
<i>And he needs help,</i>
<i>whether he knows it or not.</i>

1:33:40.365 --> 1:33:42.451
Hey, what's the problem
there, neighbor?

1:33:42.492 --> 1:33:46.538
Yep, that'll suck
some power, over time.

1:33:48.582 --> 1:33:50.250
You from around here?

1:33:50.292 --> 1:33:52.168
Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

1:33:52.210 --> 1:33:53.211
Here you go.

1:33:54.087 --> 1:33:56.423
What airport would you use?

1:33:56.465 --> 1:33:59.301
Well, airport or airstrip?

1:33:59.342 --> 1:34:00.969
Airport.

1:34:01.010 --> 1:34:02.804
Well, where you going?

1:34:03.597 --> 1:34:04.806
I don't know.

1:34:04.847 --> 1:34:06.640
Just lighting out for
the territories, huh?

1:34:06.682 --> 1:34:08.851
[chuckles] Brother,
I been there.

1:34:09.727 --> 1:34:12.147
Well, there's airstrips.

1:34:13.106 --> 1:34:15.317
The airport is El Paso.

1:34:15.358 --> 1:34:17.193
If you want someplace specific,

1:34:17.235 --> 1:34:19.446
you might could be better off
just driving to Dallas,

1:34:19.488 --> 1:34:20.905
not have to connect.

1:34:22.073 --> 1:34:23.992
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

1:34:24.033 --> 1:34:26.411
Can you get those chicken
crates out of the bed?

1:34:27.703 --> 1:34:29.498
What are you talking about?

1:34:45.347 --> 1:34:49.184
Hey, Mr. Sporting Goods.

1:34:49.225 --> 1:34:50.810
Hey, yourself.

1:34:51.353 --> 1:34:52.728
You a sport?

1:34:53.855 --> 1:34:55.231
Yeah, that's me.

1:34:56.024 --> 1:34:58.318
I got beers in my room.

1:34:58.360 --> 1:35:01.779
Oh, I'm waiting on my wife.

1:35:01.821 --> 1:35:05.617
Oh. That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

1:35:05.659 --> 1:35:06.618
Well, half.

1:35:07.118 --> 1:35:08.244
What else, then?

1:35:09.412 --> 1:35:12.040
Just looking for what's coming.

1:35:12.081 --> 1:35:15.001
Yeah. But no one
ever sees that.

1:35:16.336 --> 1:35:19.713
Beer. That's what's coming.

1:35:19.755 --> 1:35:22.175
I'll bring the ice chest out
here. You can stay married.

1:35:22.217 --> 1:35:24.553
No, ma'am,
I know what beer leads to.

1:35:25.178 --> 1:35:26.638
[chuckles]

1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:28.473
Beer leads to more beer.

1:35:34.563 --> 1:35:37.106
[machine gun firing]

1:35:40.109 --> 1:35:41.861
[men clamoring]

1:35:52.497 --> 1:35:53.915
[tires squealing]

1:35:56.834 --> 1:35:58.503
[woman crying]

1:35:59.254 --> 1:36:00.505
[woman shouting]

1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:14.852
[baby crying]

1:36:15.562 --> 1:36:17.021
[man] You all right?

1:36:22.318 --> 1:36:23.486
[Bell] Call the police.

1:36:25.029 --> 1:36:26.531
[translating in Spanish]

1:36:30.118 --> 1:36:31.869
Your local law enforcement.

1:36:33.829 --> 1:36:35.331
I'm not on their radio.

1:37:01.941 --> 1:37:03.443
[sobbing]

1:37:26.007 --> 1:37:29.260
Buy you a cup of coffee
before you drive home?

1:37:29.302 --> 1:37:30.637
No money in his room there?

1:37:30.679 --> 1:37:33.389
Couple hundred, on his person.

1:37:33.431 --> 1:37:35.849
Those<i> hombres</i> would
have taken the stash.

1:37:35.891 --> 1:37:37.851
I suppose so.

1:37:37.893 --> 1:37:40.271
Though they was
leaving in a hurry.

1:37:40.313 --> 1:37:42.565
It's all the goddamn money,
Ed Tom.

1:37:43.274 --> 1:37:44.900
Money and the drugs.

1:37:46.569 --> 1:37:50.031
It's just goddamn
beyond everything.

1:37:50.072 --> 1:37:53.368
What's it mean?
What's it leading to?

1:37:53.409 --> 1:37:56.287
You know, if you'd have
told me 20 years ago

1:37:56.329 --> 1:38:01.167
that I'd see children
walking the streets of our
Texas towns with green hair,

1:38:01.209 --> 1:38:03.252
bones in their noses,

1:38:03.294 --> 1:38:05.338
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

1:38:05.380 --> 1:38:07.382
Signs and wonders.

1:38:07.423 --> 1:38:11.636
But I think once you quit
hearing "sir" and "ma'am,"
the rest is soon to follow.

1:38:11.678 --> 1:38:13.388
-Oh, it's the tide.
-Yeah.

1:38:13.429 --> 1:38:15.431
It's the dismal tide.

1:38:15.473 --> 1:38:16.850
It is not the one thing.

1:38:16.890 --> 1:38:18.934
Not the one thing.

1:38:18.976 --> 1:38:21.937
Yeah, well, none of that
explains your man, though.

1:38:21.979 --> 1:38:24.982
He's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

1:38:25.024 --> 1:38:27.026
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.

1:38:27.068 --> 1:38:28.653
Yeah, well,
what would you call him?

1:38:28.695 --> 1:38:32.240
Well, sometimes, I think
he's pretty much a ghost.

1:38:32.281 --> 1:38:34.158
-He's real, all right.
-Oh, yeah?

1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:36.661
Yeah. All of that
over at the Eagle Hotel?

1:38:36.703 --> 1:38:37.871
Just beyond everything.

1:38:37.911 --> 1:38:40.456
Yeah. Got some
hard bark on him.

1:38:40.498 --> 1:38:43.125
Why, well, that
don't hardly say it.

1:38:44.627 --> 1:38:46.504
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

1:38:46.546 --> 1:38:50.466
walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired
army colonel.

1:38:51.175 --> 1:38:52.635
It's hard to believe.

1:38:52.677 --> 1:38:55.137
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

1:38:56.097 --> 1:38:57.557
Now, who'd do such a thing?

1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:00.226
How do you defend against it?

1:39:01.561 --> 1:39:04.480
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

1:39:04.522 --> 1:39:06.524
Sorry we couldn't
help your boy.

1:39:42.393 --> 1:39:43.603
[sighs]

1:41:57.028 --> 1:41:58.071
[sighs]

1:42:39.152 --> 1:42:40.905
[Ellis] In back!

1:42:40.947 --> 1:42:42.323
How'd you know I was here?

1:42:42.364 --> 1:42:44.617
Who else'd be
driving up in your truck?

1:42:45.367 --> 1:42:46.494
You heard it?

1:42:46.535 --> 1:42:48.579
-How's that?
-Did you hear my...

1:42:49.914 --> 1:42:51.791
You're having fun with me.

1:42:51.833 --> 1:42:53.835
What give you that idea?

1:42:53.876 --> 1:42:55.753
I seen one of
the cats heard it.

1:42:55.795 --> 1:42:57.922
How'd you know it was my truck?

1:42:57.964 --> 1:43:01.134
I deduced it
when you walked in.

1:43:01.174 --> 1:43:02.969
How many of them
things you got now?

1:43:03.011 --> 1:43:05.554
Cats? Oh,
I don't know, several.

1:43:05.596 --> 1:43:08.850
Well, it depends on
what you mean by "got."

1:43:08.891 --> 1:43:12.311
Some of them are half wild,
some of them are just outlaws.

1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:18.067
How you been, Ellis?

1:43:18.860 --> 1:43:20.235
You're looking at it.

1:43:21.529 --> 1:43:24.657
I got to say,
you're looking older.

1:43:24.699 --> 1:43:25.950
I am older.

1:43:27.576 --> 1:43:29.996
Got a letter from your wife.

1:43:30.038 --> 1:43:34.291
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

1:43:35.334 --> 1:43:36.377
Didn't know there was any.

1:43:36.418 --> 1:43:38.129
Told me you're quitting.

1:43:38.504 --> 1:43:40.173
[sighs]

1:43:41.340 --> 1:43:42.424
You want a cup?

1:43:42.466 --> 1:43:43.843
[Ellis] Appreciate it.

1:43:51.684 --> 1:43:53.519
How fresh is that coffee?

1:43:53.561 --> 1:43:56.731
I generally make
a fresh pot every week,

1:43:56.772 --> 1:43:58.941
even if there's some left over.

1:44:01.276 --> 1:44:03.445
That man that shot you
died in prison?

1:44:05.948 --> 1:44:08.076
Angola. Yeah.

1:44:08.117 --> 1:44:10.036
What'd you done,
he'd have been released?

1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:13.414
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

1:44:14.207 --> 1:44:16.584
Wouldn't be no point in it.

1:44:16.625 --> 1:44:19.128
Kindly surprised to
hear you say that.

1:44:19.170 --> 1:44:21.463
Well, all the time you

1:44:21.505 --> 1:44:23.883
spend trying to get back
what's been took from you,

1:44:23.925 --> 1:44:26.594
more is going out the door.

1:44:26.635 --> 1:44:30.723
After a while, you just have to
try to get a tourniquet on it.

1:44:30.765 --> 1:44:34.435
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

1:44:37.646 --> 1:44:39.565
Loretta tells me
you're quitting.

1:44:40.357 --> 1:44:42.110
How come you doing that?

1:44:42.151 --> 1:44:43.276
I don't know.

1:44:46.906 --> 1:44:48.157
I feel overmatched.

1:44:53.121 --> 1:44:55.164
I always figured
when I got older,

1:44:55.748 --> 1:44:56.916
God would

1:44:58.291 --> 1:45:00.293
sort of come into
my life somehow.

1:45:03.505 --> 1:45:04.840
And he didn't.

1:45:08.427 --> 1:45:09.845
I don't blame him.

1:45:12.473 --> 1:45:15.350
If I was him, I'd have the same
opinion of me that he does.

1:45:16.227 --> 1:45:17.770
You don't know whatt he thinks.

1:45:32.285 --> 1:45:35.788
I sent Uncle Mac's thumb buster
and badge over to the Rangers,

1:45:35.830 --> 1:45:38.624
put it in their museum.

1:45:38.666 --> 1:45:43.254
Your daddy ever tell you how
Uncle Mac come to his reward?

1:45:43.296 --> 1:45:46.674
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

1:45:49.218 --> 1:45:51.595
Seven or eight of them
come up there,

1:45:51.637 --> 1:45:54.265
all wanting this,
wanting that.

1:45:54.307 --> 1:45:57.559
Uncle Mac went back in the
house to get the shotgun, well,

1:45:58.769 --> 1:46:00.104
they was ahead of him.

1:46:01.354 --> 1:46:03.816
Shot him in his doorway.

1:46:03.858 --> 1:46:06.110
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

1:46:06.152 --> 1:46:10.239
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

1:46:10.281 --> 1:46:13.742
They just sat there on their
horses, watching him die.

1:46:15.744 --> 1:46:17.579
After a while one of them
said something

1:46:17.621 --> 1:46:19.540
in Indian and they turned,

1:46:20.833 --> 1:46:22.084
left out.

1:46:24.920 --> 1:46:28.341
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

1:46:28.381 --> 1:46:30.383
Shot through the left lung.

1:46:32.053 --> 1:46:35.597
And that was that,
as they say.

1:46:39.518 --> 1:46:40.602
When'd he die?

1:46:42.021 --> 1:46:45.274
1909.

1:46:45.316 --> 1:46:49.570
No, I mean, was it right
away, or in the night or...

1:46:49.611 --> 1:46:51.197
When was it?

1:46:51.239 --> 1:46:53.199
I believe it was that night.

1:46:53.241 --> 1:46:55.368
She buried him
the next morning.

1:46:55.408 --> 1:46:57.995
Digging in that
hard old caliche.

1:47:01.207 --> 1:47:03.542
What you got ain't nothing new.

1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:07.046
This country is hard on people.

1:47:11.384 --> 1:47:13.386
You can't stop what's coming.

1:47:15.388 --> 1:47:17.265
It ain't all waiting on you.

1:47:20.393 --> 1:47:21.852
That's vanity.

1:47:22.644 --> 1:47:25.022
[gears turning]

1:48:23.122 --> 1:48:25.582
I knew this wasn't done with.

1:48:28.252 --> 1:48:29.837
I ain't got the money.

1:48:32.298 --> 1:48:34.008
What little I had is long gone

1:48:34.049 --> 1:48:36.218
and there's bills
aplenty to pay yet.

1:48:38.346 --> 1:48:40.014
I buried my mother today.

1:48:40.889 --> 1:48:42.891
Ain't paid for that, neither.

1:48:43.934 --> 1:48:45.686
I wouldn't worry about it.

1:48:48.481 --> 1:48:49.857
I need to sit down.

1:49:05.289 --> 1:49:07.833
You got no cause to hurt me.

1:49:07.875 --> 1:49:11.170
No. But I gave my word.

1:49:12.671 --> 1:49:14.965
You gave your word?

1:49:15.007 --> 1:49:16.467
To your husband.

1:49:19.428 --> 1:49:21.013
That don't make sense.

1:49:22.306 --> 1:49:25.393
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

1:49:25.434 --> 1:49:29.063
Your husband had the
opportunity to save you.

1:49:29.104 --> 1:49:31.815
Instead he used you
to try to save himself.

1:49:37.112 --> 1:49:38.447
Not like that.

1:49:40.657 --> 1:49:42.368
Not like you say.

1:49:48.457 --> 1:49:50.209
You don't have to do this.

1:49:50.251 --> 1:49:52.461
People always
say the same thing.

1:49:54.380 --> 1:49:55.464
What do they say?

1:49:56.549 --> 1:49:59.051
They say,
"You don't have to do this."

1:50:00.094 --> 1:50:01.303
You don't.

1:50:04.056 --> 1:50:05.099
Okay.

1:50:10.271 --> 1:50:12.231
This is the best I can do.

1:50:13.399 --> 1:50:14.649
Call it.

1:50:18.987 --> 1:50:21.907
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

1:50:24.868 --> 1:50:27.371
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

1:50:28.330 --> 1:50:29.373
Call it.

1:50:29.706 --> 1:50:30.791
No.

1:50:32.543 --> 1:50:34.420
I ain't gonna call it.

1:50:38.006 --> 1:50:39.300
Call it.

1:50:39.341 --> 1:50:41.302
The coin don't have no say.

1:50:42.635 --> 1:50:44.179
It's just you.

1:50:47.099 --> 1:50:49.602
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:21.300
[kids chattering]

1:51:31.519 --> 1:51:33.521
[crash]

1:51:54.375 --> 1:51:55.876
[glass clinking]

1:52:32.787 --> 1:52:36.166
Mister, you got a bone
sticking out of your arm.

1:52:36.208 --> 1:52:38.210
I'm all right. Let me just
sit here a minute.

1:52:38.252 --> 1:52:39.794
[kid 2] There's an
ambulance coming.

1:52:39.836 --> 1:52:41.796
The man over yonder
went to call.

1:52:41.838 --> 1:52:43.591
All right.

1:52:43.632 --> 1:52:45.718
[kid 1] Are you all right?

1:52:45.758 --> 1:52:47.428
You got a bone
sticking out your arm.

1:52:48.803 --> 1:52:50.598
What'll you take for the shirt?

1:52:55.603 --> 1:52:58.021
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

1:53:05.529 --> 1:53:07.698
Look at that fucking bone.

1:53:08.741 --> 1:53:09.824
Tie this for me.

1:53:11.076 --> 1:53:12.703
Just tie it, just tie it.

1:53:13.828 --> 1:53:15.830
[sirens wailing in distance]

1:53:31.346 --> 1:53:32.765
Hell, mister.

1:53:32.805 --> 1:53:35.016
Look, I don't mind
helping someone out.

1:53:35.058 --> 1:53:36.809
-That's a lot of money.
-Take it.

1:53:37.645 --> 1:53:40.689
Take it and you didn't see me.

1:53:40.731 --> 1:53:42.566
I was already gone.

1:53:43.233 --> 1:53:44.318
Yes, sir.

1:53:49.030 --> 1:53:50.741
You know part of
that's mine, right?

1:53:50.783 --> 1:53:52.409
You still got your damn shirt.

1:53:52.451 --> 1:53:54.119
Ain't even what it was for.

1:53:54.161 --> 1:53:56.705
Well, maybe. But I'm
still out a shirt.

1:53:56.747 --> 1:53:59.583
[sirens approaching]

1:54:17.267 --> 1:54:18.644
Maybe I'll go riding.

1:54:18.686 --> 1:54:19.728
Okay.

1:54:19.770 --> 1:54:21.188
What do you think?

1:54:21.229 --> 1:54:23.190
Well, I can't plan your day.

1:54:24.692 --> 1:54:26.109
I mean, would you
care to join me?

1:54:26.151 --> 1:54:28.487
Lord, no, I'm not retired.

1:54:30.489 --> 1:54:32.407
Maybe I'll help out here, then.

1:54:33.617 --> 1:54:34.909
Better not.

1:54:39.080 --> 1:54:40.457
How'd you sleep?

1:54:40.499 --> 1:54:42.751
I don't know. Had dreams.

1:54:42.793 --> 1:54:44.837
Well, you got
time for them now.

1:54:44.878 --> 1:54:47.047
Anything interesting?

1:54:47.088 --> 1:54:49.675
They always is to
the party concerned.

1:54:52.177 --> 1:54:54.513
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

1:54:57.265 --> 1:55:00.602
All right, then. Two of them,
both had my father in them.

1:55:00.644 --> 1:55:02.354
It's peculiar.

1:55:02.396 --> 1:55:05.440
I'm older now than he
ever was by 20 years.

1:55:05.482 --> 1:55:09.695
So, in a sense,
he's the younger man.

1:55:09.737 --> 1:55:12.364
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well, but

1:55:13.615 --> 1:55:15.409
it was about meeting him
in town somewheres

1:55:15.450 --> 1:55:17.077
and he give me some money.

1:55:17.952 --> 1:55:19.454
I think I lost it.

1:55:21.582 --> 1:55:26.628
The second one, it was like
we was both back in older times

1:55:26.670 --> 1:55:30.507
and I was a-horseback
going through
the mountains of a night.

1:55:30.549 --> 1:55:34.052
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

1:55:34.094 --> 1:55:37.431
It was cold and there
was snow on the ground.

1:55:37.472 --> 1:55:39.892
And he would... Rode past me
and kept on going.

1:55:39.933 --> 1:55:42.895
Never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

1:55:42.936 --> 1:55:47.691
He had his blanket wrapped
around him and his head down.

1:55:50.193 --> 1:55:53.864
When he rode past, I seen he
was carrying fire in a horn,

1:55:53.906 --> 1:55:55.532
the way people used to do,

1:55:55.574 --> 1:55:58.786
and I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

1:55:58.827 --> 1:56:00.495
about the color of the moon.

1:56:01.955 --> 1:56:06.460
And in the dream, I knew that
he was going on ahead.

1:56:07.669 --> 1:56:09.504
And he was fixing
to make a fire

1:56:09.546 --> 1:56:12.340
somewhere out there in all
that dark and all that cold.

1:56:16.094 --> 1:56:18.680
And I knew that whenever
I got there, he'd be there.

1:56:23.685 --> 1:56:24.853
Then I woke up.
