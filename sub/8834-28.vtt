The idol!

One.. two... three!

My, my, my! You are one noisy fellow,
Professor O'Bowens.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.458
-Don Karnage!
-The one and only.

01:44.542 --> 01:48.208
I will be taking that little knickknack,
if you please.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.375
Not this time, pirate.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.709
Feel the fury of my whip!

01:52.792 --> 01:54.250
Hi-yah!

01:55.291 --> 01:59.208
Um, did I say whip?
I meant wimp.

01:59.291 --> 02:02.792
You fools, that's the
Idol of the Spirit Switcher.

02:02.875 --> 02:05.542
According to legend,
it can steal your very soul

02:05.625 --> 02:06.959
and switch it with another.

02:07.041 --> 02:10.959
Who cares about that?
Calm him down, boys.

02:11.041 --> 02:14.542
No. No, please.
Listen to me. You gotta listen...

02:15.291 --> 02:16.667

02:22.375 --> 02:23.709
After him!

02:24.375 --> 02:27.709
[Baloo yawns]
I wonder what's keeping the professor.

02:27.792 --> 02:30.291
He should have been here an hour ago.

02:31.333 --> 02:34.041
Well, maybe there were
long lines at the excavation.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.792
What's the matter, little britches?
Sand too hot?

02:36.875 --> 02:39.333
[panting]
Uh-uh, Baloo.

02:39.417 --> 02:42.542
I'm keeping in shape for
the track and field tryouts tomorrow.

02:42.625 --> 02:45.667
Well, adults have bigger sports to play.

02:45.750 --> 02:50.333
-Like what?
-Like flying. Now that is a real sport.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.917
Well, you sit down and use your noodle.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.583
Come on, Baloo, anyone can fly.
The plane does all the work.

02:56.667 --> 02:59.875
Yeah, but can anyone win this?

02:59.959 --> 03:03.375
The Cape Suzette
Championship Fly-offs.

03:03.458 --> 03:08.250
That's right, sport. You're looking at
the next Pilot of the Year.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.417
Baloo! Baloo!
[panting]

03:11.500 --> 03:15.917
Hurry! Take this idol to Cape Suzette!
I'll see you back there as soon as I can!

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Where are you going?

03:18.083 --> 03:20.917
To head off the air pirates
while you make your getaway!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.417
[both] Pirates?

03:22.500 --> 03:26.834
And whatever you do, do not look
at the idol during a thunderstorm.

03:26.917 --> 03:29.000
-Got that?
-[both] Thunderstorm?

03:29.083 --> 03:31.333
Run! I mean, fly!

03:32.083 --> 03:33.792
This way, men!

03:33.875 --> 03:36.875
Just passing through!

03:37.834 --> 03:39.500
That way, men!

03:40.208 --> 03:42.917
This is almost too easy.
[grunts]

03:43.000 --> 03:45.208
Small jungle, isn't it?

03:45.291 --> 03:49.208
Well, we meet again, professor.
[laughing]

03:49.291 --> 03:51.291
Where is the idol?

03:51.375 --> 03:53.750
[stuttering]
You pirates don't scare me.

03:53.834 --> 03:58.458
Nothing you could do can make me talk.
My courage is unshakable.

03:58.542 --> 04:02.458
[Baloo] Oh, clip my wings!
What a storm!

04:02.542 --> 04:07.959
That's all we need, especially after
what the professor said about the idol.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.458
-Better not look at it.
-OK.

04:10.542 --> 04:14.291
-I wonder what would happen...
-Probably nothing.

04:14.375 --> 04:15.542
-[Kit] Yeah!
-[thunder rumbles]

04:19.333 --> 04:20.250
What the...?

04:28.458 --> 04:31.417
[Baloo's voice]
Clip my wings. What happened?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.250
[Kit's voice]
I know what you mean, Baloo.

04:33.333 --> 04:36.000
Suddenly, I feel so heavy.

04:36.083 --> 04:39.458
Little britches, how...
how did you get so big?

04:39.542 --> 04:41.250
Hey!

04:41.333 --> 04:44.125
And ruggedly handsome?

04:44.208 --> 04:47.875
Baloo, I'm you, and you're...
[gulps]

04:47.959 --> 04:49.166
Me!

04:49.250 --> 04:52.333
Whoa! I've heard
of going through a second childhood,

04:52.417 --> 04:54.250
but not somebody else's!

04:54.333 --> 04:56.959
[Kit's voice]
The idol! Whoa!

04:57.125 --> 05:01.750
[Baloo's voice] Uh-oh! Mini-muscles, help!
Thanks, kiddo.

05:01.834 --> 05:05.750
Sure. Wow!
Things look different from up here.

05:05.834 --> 05:10.000
Yeah, and I don't like it.
How we gonna change back?

05:10.083 --> 05:13.500
[Kit's voice] You got me,
but the professor must know.

05:13.583 --> 05:16.125
[Baloo's voice] We'll just have to
wait for him when we get back home.

05:16.208 --> 05:19.083
[Kit's voice] Oh, no, what are
we gonna tell Miss Cunningham?

05:19.166 --> 05:22.208
[Baloo's voice] We can't tell her
the truth, she'll never believe it.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.625
We won't say nothing.

05:24.709 --> 05:26.917
But our voices!
She'll know.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.667
Voices? There's nothing wrong
with our voices, only Becky's ears.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.458
[Rebecca] Well, I'm certainly glad
you boys got home safely.

05:37.542 --> 05:40.083
I only wish you'd brought
the professor with you.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.750
Feet off the desk, Kit.

05:41.834 --> 05:44.250
It's bad enough
I have to tell Baloo all the time.

05:44.333 --> 05:47.792
OK, OK. Don't pop your pearls, Becky.

05:47.875 --> 05:51.041
Kit, how dare you talk that way!
And how'd you do that?

05:51.125 --> 05:53.125
-Do what?
-Sound like Baloo.

05:53.208 --> 05:56.417
I don't sound like Baloo. Do I?

05:56.500 --> 06:00.417
-Not to me.
-OK, what are you two up to?

06:00.667 --> 06:02.500
[no dialogue]

06:02.583 --> 06:03.417
What?

06:03.500 --> 06:07.667
I said, something must be wrong
with your hearing!

06:07.750 --> 06:11.542
Must be.
Oh, by the way, your coach called to say

06:11.625 --> 06:14.333
that track tryouts have been pushed up
to this afternoon.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.583
What?
This afternoon?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.834
Oh, great!
Swell!

06:18.917 --> 06:20.458
Why are you upset?

06:20.542 --> 06:24.458
Now, don't worry, buddy boy.
I can do the tryouts if I have to.

06:24.542 --> 06:28.166
[laughs]
You? Oh, get serious.

06:28.250 --> 06:31.834
Baloo, shouldn't you be showing the boy
some encouragement?

06:31.917 --> 06:35.625
Anyway, you've got
your own competition to worry about today.

06:35.709 --> 06:37.542
-What's that?
-The Fly-offs.

06:37.625 --> 06:42.542
Today?
Oh, I never could keep my dates straight.

06:42.625 --> 06:47.291
-Gosh, does this mean I get to fly?
-How else do you win a fly-off?

06:47.375 --> 06:50.208
-All by myself?
-Of course.

06:50.291 --> 06:51.208
Wow!

06:51.291 --> 06:53.917
[whistles]
Hold it! Stop the clock.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.291
Drop anchor.
Time-out, Beckers.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.458
Kit, what's gotten into you?

06:58.542 --> 07:04.125
I didn't want to tell you, but inside
that head is the mind of a child.

07:04.208 --> 07:07.583
Kit, you shouldn't say things like that,
even if it is true.

07:07.667 --> 07:11.542
-But Miss Cunningham!
-Don't you "Miss Cunningham" me, Baloo.

07:11.625 --> 07:14.625
I'm counting on you
to win those Fly-offs to boost business!

07:14.709 --> 07:16.542
Where are you going, Beckers?

07:16.625 --> 07:22.500
To take an aspirin. I have a headache.
My ears hurt. I'm going crazy.

07:27.166 --> 07:30.333
[Mad Dog] Are you sure you want to
go after the idol, captain?

07:30.417 --> 07:34.083
The professor said it could be dangerous.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.750
Only to those who keep it from me.

07:37.250 --> 07:41.750
The Cape Suzette galoots will not hurt me
if they cannot see me.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.709
[chuckles]
I am so smart.

07:43.792 --> 07:46.125
Now, get ready to lower the submarine.

07:46.417 --> 07:47.959
At your command, captain.

07:50.125 --> 07:53.250
[Don Karnage]
Not yet, you fool!

08:01.750 --> 08:06.000
When I get back,
I will hang them by their pinkies.

08:10.208 --> 08:13.542
-See you later, Baloo.
-Where are you going, big britches?

08:13.625 --> 08:15.250
My track tryouts.

08:15.333 --> 08:18.542
Well, you can't go to that!
Grown-ups aren't allowed.

08:18.625 --> 08:20.750
Oh, yeah.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.875
OK. You go.

08:22.959 --> 08:24.959
Can't. Got my Fly-offs.

08:25.041 --> 08:30.709
-You think they'll let a kid fly?
-Uh-oh. What are we gonna do?

08:30.792 --> 08:32.082
[Kit's voice]
We've gotta switch!

08:32.166 --> 08:35.500
-But you can't fly.
-Sure, anyone can fly.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.875
But can you make the track team?

08:37.958 --> 08:42.792
Hey, back in school,
I was number one in track and field...

08:43.000 --> 08:44.875
Or was that field and stream?

08:44.959 --> 08:47.250
[Rebecca]
Let's go, Baloo! We're late!

08:53.959 --> 08:56.166
[man]
OK. Hurdles are first.

08:56.250 --> 08:59.750
Now, you want a fast time,
but I dock points if you knock them over.

08:59.834 --> 09:03.500
-You first, Cloudkicker.
-Hey, no problem, teach.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.500
[teacher]
What's wrong with your voice?

09:05.583 --> 09:09.542
Uh, gee, I guess
I'm just growing up, that's all.

09:17.667 --> 09:18.792
[whistle blows]

09:19.208 --> 09:21.750
Get over here, Cloudkicker.

09:21.834 --> 09:27.166
-What? I didn't touch a single one.
-You jump over hurdles!

09:27.250 --> 09:32.000
Oh, get out of here.
The only thing I jump to are conclusions.

13:23.417 --> 13:26.000
[sighs]
You know, I really like that word.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.500
[Rebecca]
Who taught you how to land a plane?

13:35.583 --> 13:38.417
Now tie the <i>Sea Duck</i>
up to the dock, Baloo.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.166
Surely, you can handle that.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.792
[blowing]

13:45.667 --> 13:48.458
[exclaims]
Look! It's Professor O'Bowens!

13:53.250 --> 13:55.917
Boy! Are we glad to see you.

13:56.000 --> 14:01.041
[panting] Same here.
That last 400 miles is a killer.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.834
You've got to help us.
I'm him and he's me,

14:03.917 --> 14:05.959
and we've got all kinds of problems.

14:06.041 --> 14:09.667
Oh, no! I told you not to
look at the idol.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.250
Well, just tell us what to do
to change back.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.709
We need the idol
and a strong bolt of lightning

14:14.792 --> 14:17.625
-to reverse this.
-Let's hurry.

14:17.709 --> 14:20.583
I hate being old and fat and tired.

14:20.667 --> 14:23.291
OK, OK. We got the message.

14:25.291 --> 14:30.291
At last! I am now one of the idle rich.
[laughs]

14:36.125 --> 14:37.041
[yelling]

14:38.458 --> 14:40.583
Help! Thief!

14:40.667 --> 14:43.709
[grumbling]

14:43.792 --> 14:44.959
Help!

14:46.709 --> 14:48.166
[yells]

14:53.083 --> 14:55.583
[Rebecca's voice]
Stop, or I'll call the police!

14:59.083 --> 15:01.166
Where's Becky going with the idol?

15:01.250 --> 15:04.000
Stop! Thief!

15:04.083 --> 15:06.834
Huh? That's me.

15:06.917 --> 15:12.083
[whines] First my ears go bad,
now my eyes.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.667
-Karnage!
-Karnage!

15:13.750 --> 15:18.000
[Becky's voice yells]
Not me, you klutz, the pirate!

15:18.083 --> 15:20.083
He's got the idol!

15:20.166 --> 15:23.125
That's what you think.
Miss Cunningham's got it.

15:23.208 --> 15:24.625
I do not!

15:24.709 --> 15:27.625
Oh, no! Don't tell me
lightning struck twice.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.792
Will someone tell me
what's happening here?

15:35.208 --> 15:37.125
[Rebecca's voice]
I can't believe this happened.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.792
Listen, fellas...
I mean, ma'am, sir.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.333
Uh, listen, this whole mix-up can be fixed

15:45.417 --> 15:47.291
if we get the idol back from the pirates,

15:47.375 --> 15:49.917
but we have to do it
before sunup tomorrow,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.250
or you'll stay this way forever.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.583
What?!

15:53.667 --> 15:55.917
Then we better take rain dancing lessons.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.834
It's going to take a lot of lightning
for that idol to fix this mess.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.667
Good luck.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.

16:02.750 --> 16:07.375
Oh, great! I get to spend
the rest of my life as a thief!

16:07.458 --> 16:11.208
Hey, Papa Bear, isn't there a way
to make a lightning storm?

16:11.291 --> 16:13.917
Hey, you're right, Kit.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.417
There's this new idea, cloud seeding.

16:16.500 --> 16:21.792
You just dump salt into some clouds
and <i>voilà, </i> instant storm!

16:36.250 --> 16:38.291
[Don Karnage's voice]
Feast your eyes on this!

16:38.375 --> 16:40.417
-Eat your heart--
-Hubba-hubba!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.792
Don't mind if we do, girlie.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.542
Girlie? What girlie?

16:44.625 --> 16:48.542
Get your hands off me and slap yourself!
What are you talking about, you fools?

16:49.458 --> 16:51.917
[Kit's voice]
Oh, no! The sun's coming up already.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.959
There isn't much time.
Only ten minutes, tops.

16:55.041 --> 16:58.542
There's the vulture.
Here, britches, give them a call.

16:58.625 --> 17:01.375
Tell them we got Karnage...
uh, sorta.

17:01.458 --> 17:05.000
Vulture, this is the <i>Sea Duck.</i>
Do you read me?

17:05.083 --> 17:09.666
<i>We've got Karnage.</i>
<i>We'll trade him for the idol and the girl.</i>

17:12.333 --> 17:15.709
Tell him the truth.
We've grown attached to both of them.

17:15.791 --> 17:17.125
Keep Karnage.

17:17.208 --> 17:21.333
Now, listen here, you lug heads,
you have to trade.

17:21.416 --> 17:26.165
-I am a man! I cannot live like this.
-Shut up, skirt.

17:27.959 --> 17:32.458
Clear the hangar, men!
Launch the fighters!

17:32.542 --> 17:37.542
Shoot down that cabin...
Uh, plane. Plane!

17:41.333 --> 17:43.000
Pirate fighters at 12:00!

17:48.291 --> 17:51.417
What do we do now?
We can't fight all those planes!

17:51.500 --> 17:55.834
[Baloo's voice] We need some cover.
I know, a rainstorm.

17:55.917 --> 17:58.333
All we need is some clouds.

17:58.667 --> 18:01.125
Look, Papa Bear! There's a cloud.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.625
[Rebecca's voice] I have powder puffs
in my makeup case bigger than that.

18:03.709 --> 18:06.917
Well, it'll have to do.
Now, man the salt bombs, britches.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.667
Let 'er rip, Kit!

18:12.750 --> 18:17.208
And just use a pinch.
A little salt goes a long way.

18:17.291 --> 18:20.125
Baloo, pull up, pull up!
We're going to crash!

18:22.208 --> 18:24.166
You have to pull up!

18:25.792 --> 18:26.834
[yells]

18:27.959 --> 18:29.000
[thunder rumbles]

18:38.875 --> 18:40.250
Let go!

18:41.709 --> 18:42.875
Whoa!

18:45.250 --> 18:46.458
Are you OK, britches?

18:46.542 --> 18:49.667
-[pants] Yeah, but we have a problem.
-What?

18:49.750 --> 18:50.667
That!

18:50.750 --> 18:53.333
[Baloo's voice] I thought I told you
a little dab'll do ya.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.000
[Kit's voice]
I couldn't help it.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.375
You turned the plane into a saltshaker.

19:00.792 --> 19:04.041
[Dumbtruck mumbling]
What's happening?

19:04.125 --> 19:06.709
It's a hurricane!

19:06.792 --> 19:11.083
Well, we needed lightning, anywho.
Now all we need is the idol.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.750
So, let's go in after it.

19:13.834 --> 19:16.166
Stop! We'll never make it!

19:16.250 --> 19:20.083
Yeah, would you rather
wear boxer shorts the rest of your life?

19:21.125 --> 19:22.375
Go for it.

19:37.291 --> 19:43.333
Ah, Captain Karnage...
I, uh, it's so good to see you.

19:43.417 --> 19:47.458
Oh, thank goodness, there I am...
I mean, not here, but there. You know.

19:47.542 --> 19:49.625
Oh, yes. I understand.

19:49.709 --> 19:54.458
And I'll tell you this right now,
from where I stand, I look marvelous.

19:54.542 --> 19:57.458
Hand me that idol
so we can unscramble this mess.

19:57.542 --> 20:01.959
Of course, captain.
I was keeping it safe for you.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.291
[rumbling]

20:03.375 --> 20:04.959
[thunder rumbles]

20:05.041 --> 20:07.542
Catch it!
There's only one minute left!

20:20.333 --> 20:22.917
Ow! Ow! It's hot!

20:28.166 --> 20:33.667
-[normal voice] Ah, I'm me again.
-[normal voice] Me too. I can see my feet!

20:33.750 --> 20:37.917
[normal voice My beautiful bod.
I am my wonderful self again!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.709
I'm so... me.

20:40.959 --> 20:44.250
-The idol, it's gone!
-Must have fallen out the door.

21:04.709 --> 21:07.834
My plane! We've got to save my plane!

21:13.125 --> 21:14.542
All aboard!

21:15.917 --> 21:18.250
[all yelling]

21:26.917 --> 21:29.458
All those years
of searching for that idol,

21:29.542 --> 21:30.667
and now it's lost.

21:30.750 --> 21:35.083
Good riddance. I've been a kid
enough times for one lifetime.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.709
Well, I'm just glad to be a kid again.

21:37.792 --> 21:40.625
At least neither of you
spent time stuck in a pirate.

21:40.709 --> 21:44.500
And from the look of things,
I got out just in time.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.500
Now, to take care
of one mutinous slime ball!

21:49.583 --> 21:54.125
[Dumptruck's voice]
It was not me, captain. It was Mad Dog.

21:55.041 --> 21:57.875
Hey, what am I doing over there?

21:57.959 --> 22:00.458
[Mad Dog's voice]
What are you doing over here?

22:00.542 --> 22:05.709
What am I doing over here?
I'm in the wrong body!

22:05.792 --> 22:09.834
[both]
We have to find that idol!
