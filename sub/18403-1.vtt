What's wrong with this city?

00:08.141 --> 00:10.849
Somewhere there are ashes
and somewhere smoke.

00:11.611 --> 00:13.591
Why doesn't someone say something?

<i>\</i> hate flowers

24:22.961 --> 24:24.372
What did flowers ever do to you?

24:24.629 --> 24:26.631
Flowers are so overrated!

24:26.998 --> 24:29.274
Yeah, they look pretty...
smell nice...

24:29.468 --> 24:30.970
...but colours fade
and scent disappears...

24:31.036 --> 24:35.007
...and what you're left with
is lifeless, wilted and diseased.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.719
Thorns, on the other hand...

24:38.143 --> 24:39.884
They're not so fragile...

24:40.045 --> 24:42.491
Thorns are fearless...

24:43.949 --> 24:45.724
I don't want to be just a flower...

24:46.051 --> 24:47.462
I want to be a thorn.

May a thousand
Gods shine upon you...

25:05.470 --> 25:08.679
You have to admit...
songs of the 80's were amazing...

25:08.907 --> 25:11.285
Cheap, vulgar and extra tacky!

25:11.510 --> 25:13.285
My playlist is 'Cheap Thrills'!

25:13.445 --> 25:15.948
No way... mine is
'Jolly Good Bollywood"!

25:17.182 --> 25:18.889
Most famous song of the 80's?

25:18.950 --> 25:20.657

Cheapest song?

your moves at home...

26:48.506 --> 26:51.612
...what's with the
dainty flailing now?

26:52.043 --> 26:53.283
It's embarrassing.

26:53.712 --> 26:54.850
Embarrassing?

26:55.547 --> 26:58.221
Embarrassment is just a fancy
word for self-importance.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.727
You're nobody here!

26:59.985 --> 27:03.831
So you're not shaming
Daddy Dearest...

27:03.989 --> 27:05.969
Nor are you embarrassing yourself!

27:06.057 --> 27:07.434
Just dance, man!

27:07.759 --> 27:10.433
I can't dance in groups... only sing.

27:10.729 --> 27:14.506
Oh, really?
And that's amazing...

27:14.733 --> 27:17.077
...but this isn't choir
practice - it's a dance class!

27:18.003 --> 27:19.812
It's just not my scene...

27:19.938 --> 27:22.612
Shh! Just dance!

27:23.041 --> 27:25.351
Forget your inner Lois Lane...

27:25.510 --> 27:27.353
...you were born to be Wonder Woman!

27:27.646 --> 27:30.252
In the name of JLo's sex appeal...

27:30.682 --> 27:36.098

you truly are a Baby Doll!

27:37.255 --> 27:38.359

Not again!

29:05.910 --> 29:07.082
Why are you getting annoyed?

29:07.278 --> 29:08.780
Because, Celine Dion...

29:08.880 --> 29:14.330
Your self-praise is
driving me up the wall!

29:15.153 --> 29:17.827
You're not taking me seriously...
My voice is a gift from God!

29:18.056 --> 29:19.592
Then sing for Him!

29:19.824 --> 29:20.768
No!

29:21.459 --> 29:23.200
Don't be so attention seeking, man!

29:23.261 --> 29:25.400
What if you fall in love with me?

29:26.397 --> 29:29.674
Well, Mr. Casablanca...

29:29.934 --> 29:32.141

29:32.904 --> 29:33.939
Come on... Sing.

29:34.539 --> 29:35.279
No.

29:35.473 --> 29:36.451

29:36.908 --> 29:38.319
This is your last chance...

- And you're an expert, so...
- I'm the audience!

30:44.242 --> 30:45.585
There was no feeling.

30:46.377 --> 30:51.451
Because this...
has never been broken.

30:52.517 --> 30:54.554
You'll only really sing
when it does break.

46:56.213 --> 46:59.456
...the one the boy chased through
the airport and confessed his love.

46:59.917 --> 47:01.294
Twice I thought he'd come...

47:01.985 --> 47:04.226
Both times I waited for him...

53:16.626 --> 53:18.105
I don't know, man...

53:19.129 --> 53:20.574
The first time we met...

53:20.664 --> 53:22.507
...when we spent the night talking...

53:22.666 --> 53:29.242
I just got the feeling
that you're my friend...

53:30.140 --> 53:32.086
My best friend...

53:32.943 --> 53:34.422
...and always will be.

53:34.945 --> 53:35.946
I don't know...

53:42.319 --> 53:45.232
You know, I wasn't popular in school...

53:46.656 --> 53:49.728
They thought I was a weirdo,
freak, introverted...

53:50.360 --> 53:53.569
And honestly, it made no difference...

53:54.497 --> 53:55.601
You know Wm

53:57.968 --> 54:01.882
Because I knew I was
holding on to my personality...

54:02.372 --> 54:05.216
I was waiting to find that one person...

54:05.575 --> 54:07.555
...who got my weirdness.

54:16.686 --> 54:19.098
So... best friend, huh?

54:20.657 --> 54:23.194
Bestest friend!

54:27.998 --> 54:29.841
And... you're not attracted to me?

54:32.869 --> 54:33.870
No...

54:41.211 --> 54:42.713

You know,
I'm really happy we're friends...

55:30.226 --> 55:36.438
I feel that sometimes
lust just kills friendship...

55:37.901 --> 55:39.903
Love is passion...

55:40.737 --> 55:43.217
...but friendship is peace.

55:45.408 --> 55:49.754
And I never, ever want
to lose the peace between us.

55:50.580 --> 55:52.753
Girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife...

55:53.216 --> 55:56.686
when those relationships die...
the people just leave.

55:58.888 --> 56:04.634

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:51.133
- Chatter is a fool's
pursuit... or so I've heard...

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:53.506
- But old habits die hard...

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:57.213
I've been rather
impatient for this call...

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:03.545
Hem)?

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.822
Sorry, my cheeks are turning pink...

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.923
You make me blush...

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.398
It's true, though...

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.965
You've told me
everything about you...

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.569
...and you know nothing about me...

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:22.467
<i>7</i> Why do you mm rm here?
<i>7</i> Where?

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:24.466
Vienna...

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:27.143
What are you doing here?

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:30.007
Crossed the boundary
to cross some boundaries...

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:33.352
That's tough

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:36.181
- I can handle tough...

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:40.017
Get to work, then...
See you tonight at 8?

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:41.150
- I'll send you the address...

01:23:41.249 --> 01:23:42.853
Okay... Of your house, right?

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:44.291
You wish...

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:31.857
Good morning...

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:32.921
Morning...

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.398
Slept well?

01:26:34.589 --> 01:26:35.659
Hmm

01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:39.304
I made breakfast for myself,
I hope you don't mind...

01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:42.439
<i>m</i> have made you some

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:44.902
But I didn't know
what you'd like.

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:47.272
You know nothing about me.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:49.472
I got to know quite
a bit last night...

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:52.450
Passion isn't familiarity...

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.681
I'm blushing again...

01:26:58.346 --> 01:26:59.825
Change of topic!

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:01.958
X read some of your poetry

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:05.028
It's beautiful.

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:13.272
Glad you liked them...

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:17.233
I don't get much
appreciation for my poetry...

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:21.369
were: so much angst
m your poems

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:25.879
Angst will always find angst...

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.482
Can I steal it for my music?

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:32.652
Careful...
I have an excellent lawyer...

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:34.988
He didn't even spare
my ex-husband!

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:36.886
Divorced!

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.597
Why so pleased?

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.424
Of course!
You're single...

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:42.327
Happily divorced...

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:44.267
and x have no regrets

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:46.972
raw and x are
very good fnervds

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:49.971
Every poetess should
marry at least once...

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:53.576
A happy marriage means
a good life...

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:57.680
an unhappy one means
good poem

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:00.552
By the way, I was kidding...

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:03.622
If you need my poetry...
Go ahead.

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:05.889
Thanks

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:08.416
...but what I need is you.

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:12.090
I don't want to be needed...

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.424
I want to be desired.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:23.131
You're relentless...

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:24.638
Like a walking-talking Ghalib...

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:26.211
ma: am x supposed m Say'?

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.776
Your silence said
more than enough...

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:31.773
Don't worry...

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.716
I have no room for
a relationship in my life...

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.285
Not anymore

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.388
There's more than
one kind of relationship...

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:45.456
...but only if you're up for it.

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:50.466
What are the rules like?

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.600
Easily broken...

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:57.234
So you gel my poetry

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.769
The chance to drown your sorrows

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:03.038
What do x gen

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:06.744
x thought x was enough

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:09.295
"I seek the truth that
pierces the darkest night..."

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:13.897
"I seek the devotion
I surrendered in your stead..."

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:16.936
<i>'W have</i> known <i>[he wtue
that surrender proffers</i> “

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:20.305
"But I seek that heaven
for which I have bled."

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.403
Is this supposed to be good?

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.535
I don't get <i>it...</i>

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:35.611
Didn't you say he was world famous?

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.542
He is...

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:41.382
People really admire his work...

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:43.654
And you?

01:34:48.382 --> 01:34:49.622
'(owe awkward

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:52.591

01:34:57.058 --> 01:34:58.969
You can leave, if you like...

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:01.265
And leave you alone with him?

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:03.534
No My

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:05.678
I'm dying to meet your ex-husband.

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:11.775
HOW COWS'?

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:14.279
Just...

01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:19.785
<i>7 Tam

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:25.056
Your Faoebook tells me
too many things have changed...

01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:26.856
Like the colour of your walls...

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:29.300

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:31.233

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:33.436
Fantastic work, sir!

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.700
Sir? Really... Sir?!

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:38.869
Are you trying to
make me sound old?

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.244
By the way, he doesn't
call you ma'am does he?

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.110
- You think?!
- I don't know!

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:49.978
So you're the one...
who's keeping her up at night...

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:52.556
Why waste time on sleep?

01:35:53.147 --> 01:35:55.957
Sleep is critical...

01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:58.888
<i>for he!' [0 dream</i> about <i>me?</i>

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.494
Oh, now I definitely
won't let her sleep.

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.158
I can't see this...

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:04.561
Change of topic!

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:10.002
Besides, you've fulfilled
your dreams...

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:12.871
Your new work is very interesting.

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.674
Actually, fantastic!

01:36:15.903 --> 01:36:20.511
Without a lover in his arms,
what else is a man to do...

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:25.449
- Do you guys rehearse these lines?
- No, totally natural!

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:26.887
Ah, natural...

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:33.588
People often shroud
their fear with words...

01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:37.230
Our relationship
may have changed...

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:39.927
...but the fear remains.

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.067
Why mu <i>n</i> change

01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:43.631
<i>w</i> x may ask?

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:46.610
Maybe you should
be asking the person...

01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:48.972
...whose nights are now yours...

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:53.118
People often falter...

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:55.716
...on the slippery slopes
of relationships...

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:57.549
Yeah

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:02.255
You could have shown
me a better way...

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:06.189
Let the one who is lost,
find his own way...

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:14.234
x hate you

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:16.901
A We no, a bl

01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:19.872
Such hatred... so soon?
Give me a chance...

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:23.438
Hating you is
completely justified...

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:26.752
Because I still love Saba...

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:31.452
I gave your love a chance...

01:37:31.812 --> 01:37:34.918
It's time for you to
give my friendship a chance.

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:37.625
Isn't that hard'?

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:38.953
- What?

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:43.196
To love someone...
who doesn't love you in return?

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:51.466
It's the most beautiful
feeling in the world...

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:56.881
- Doesn't it make you feel weak?
- Not at all.

01:37:57.972 --> 01:38:01.215
There's nothing like
the power of unrequited love...

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:05.187
Unlike other bonds,
it isn't shared...

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:08.319
It's mine...
and mine alone.

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:16.863
For a love like this,
I don't need Saba to love her...

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:20.432
There's no better love than that...

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:26.239
"if you gamble in
the name of love..."

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:29.744
"Stake what you like...
what's to fear?"

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:32.782
"How wonderful if you win..."

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:37.883
"Even if you lose...
all is not lost."

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.524
Don't hang up!

Where the hell are you?!

I've been trying to call you forever!

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:01.272
- You blocked my number!

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:02.534
What did you think I'd do?

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:03.902
Walk you down the aisle?

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:05.767

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:08.811

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:10.313
Congratulations!

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:13.885
Now you're Mrs. DJ Ali!

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:17.214
Must be stuck on
him like headphones...

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:20.083
Ayan, stop your crap
before I hang up.

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.726
Hello!
You don't scare me!

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:24.055
Control yourself!

Check if she called...
Walk around restlessly...

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:31.777
You're not fooling
anyone with this pose...

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:34.145
What? Me? Why?
I'm totally chill...

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:35.481
I'm cool!

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:38.252
Someone's at the door...

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:41.051
Go She? here

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:48.291
I-li!

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:49.433
<i>Nam</i>

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.229
Hi... Cold outside?

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:53.566
What are you doing?

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.999
Didn't bring any wine?
Flowers? Thorns? Nothing?

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:56.973
Should I have?

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.134
Saba

01:43:58.665 --> 01:43:59.439
AhZeh

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:02.240
Welcome home...

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:04.040
- So Alizeh...
- So nice to meet you...

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:06.744
Heard so much about you...
All good things, I hope!

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:09.377
What 7

01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:13.118
No... just... trying to
ease the tension!

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:14.688
Get a hold on yourself...

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:17.558
The 'tension' will disappear?
Come...

01:44:17.751 --> 01:44:20.391
- You know how girls can be!
- Sexist remark...

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.864
- Not appreciated!
- Not at all!

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:26.233
Give our intelligence its due!

01:44:28.895 --> 01:44:29.805
Wine?

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:31.204
Maybe later...

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:32.369
Ah, okay

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:33.604
But, Saba

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:37.614
Beauty like yours often
overshadows intelligence...

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:40.885
Ask those of us who
live off our personality...

01:44:40.974 --> 01:44:42.954
Beauty fades, Alizeh...

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:45.783
But Death, himself,
can't kill personality...

01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:49.652
Wow... So the poetry
really was yours!

01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:54.092
I thought Ayan was just
copying it off the internet!

01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:57.435
If it weren't for poetry...

01:44:57.758 --> 01:45:00.204
...I'd have died a thousand
living deaths already...

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:03.096
Cheese?

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:10.875
Will I sound phony
if I praise you some more?

01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:13.510
Not at all...
Please go ahead...

01:45:13.573 --> 01:45:14.881
No judgments!

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:17.013
Pictures do you no justice...

01:45:17.077 --> 01:45:19.284
You're even more
beautiful in person.

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:25.019
Oh, so those pictures
were to show you...

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:28.090
To make her jealous...

01:45:28.555 --> 01:45:30.535
...but why waste
envy on the resentful?

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:31.934
Wow, Ayan

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:33.868
Saba, looks like you've
had an influence...

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:35.037
A We DH of M

01:45:35.095 --> 01:45:36.267
A little to go...

01:45:40.434 --> 01:45:41.913
Well, it's not envy...

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:44.615
But you can't sing
to a mute person...

01:45:44.705 --> 01:45:46.480
...and expect them
not to feel inferior!

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:52.820
Speaking of singing...
This is my favourite song...

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:56.892
"O lover, don't ask me
to love like I did before..."

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:59.724
"O lover, don't ask me..."

01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:01.589
To love like I did before.

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:12.703
Dinner?

01:46:13.367 --> 01:46:14.038
Bream

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:21.750
Why didn't you bring Ali?

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.913
He had a concert 50

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:27.223
DJ Ali's super busy, you see...

01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:32.022
Why do you keep calling him that?
Like it's an insult...

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:33.426
Not at all!

01:46:33.854 --> 01:46:37.768
Who doesn't dream of making
people dance orl their fingertips?

01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:42.065
Alizeh, may I ask
you something personal?

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:43.904
If you don't mind...

01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:45.574
Sure

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:50.879
How did you not fall in love
with someone so charming?

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:58.817
Charming for you, maybe...

01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:01.423
He was a mg baby
when x met mm

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:06.258
He cried orl the streets,
cried in my arms...

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:07.696
Really?!

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:11.930
Ayan... Is this a compliment
or a slight?

01:47:12.225 --> 01:47:14.205
You've never cried in my arms...

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:17.673
How could I cry in your arms...

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:21.545
...when I'm so distracted by
my other feelings...

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:07.325
You got lucky, Ayan!

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:10.425
Saba's wonderful.

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.002
Anyway

01:48:19.726 --> 01:48:21.330
- Thank you for dinner.
- Go to hell!

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:23.906
'Thank you for dinner'?!

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:27.704
You're soulless!

01:48:28.235 --> 01:48:30.044
Don't you have any feelings?!

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:32.741
Not jealousy, not guilt...

01:48:33.039 --> 01:48:36.145
- Nothing?!
- I feel everything, Ayan!

01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:38.719
But you'd never
understand if I told you...

01:48:38.778 --> 01:48:40.280
You'd just misconstrue it all!

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:43.351
You're a goddamn child!

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:45.085
You've got everything!

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:47.964
Goals, passion,
a relationship...

01:48:48.088 --> 01:48:49.226
Why are you still so stubborn?!

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:50.232
Because <i>\</i> arm

01:48:50.524 --> 01:48:52.367
I'm stubborn
because it's my heart!

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:55.206
What are you going
to do about it?!

01:49:02.469 --> 01:49:04.244
Why can': you we me?

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:10.781
I do love you, Ayan...

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.022
Just not the Way
you Wm me m

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:18.824
Why?

01:49:20.186 --> 01:49:23.030
I can't... Please...

01:49:33.333 --> 01:49:35.904
- I don't want to be selfish, Ayan-
- Get lost.

01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:18.947
N: over, Ayan

01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:22.787
It's over.

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:39.008
Wed

01:50:42.068 --> 01:50:43.411
Fm m you

01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:48.251
...then to myself.

01:50:51.645 --> 01:50:54.751
I lied that I don't
have place for love...

01:51:02.889 --> 01:51:06.564
I'm falling in love
with you, Ayan...

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:13.875
And today, I finally understood
that you can never love me...

01:51:14.534 --> 01:51:16.639
...the way you love Alizeh...

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:21.041
And SUN

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:24.546
I love you...

01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:32.122
What do <i>\</i> do?

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:35.660
Saba, you've always known...

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:40.332
I can't do this, Ayan...

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:46.102
I've been down this road...

01:51:47.667 --> 01:51:49.237
It's broken me once before...

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:52.338
Saba

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:57.853
Please don't try to
change my mind...

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:02.060
<i>V you try</i>

01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:06.124
I'll give in...

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:10.128
If I give in...

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.871
I'll fall apart again...

01:52:19.232 --> 01:52:22.213
We can't choose who
to fall in love with...

01:52:25.205 --> 01:52:30.086
But We can choose
when m <i>mm</i> away

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.751
Go, Ayan

01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:36.058
Go...

01:53:58.097 --> 01:53:59.440
Let me go...

01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:02.339
Please

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:06.114
Please... let rne go...

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:11.344
I can't go on like this...

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:18.058
So x have m go' okay?

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:21.062
Okay?!

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:24.860
I have to go...

01:54:30.096 --> 01:54:32.042
If I can't do it...

01:54:32.098 --> 01:54:34.135
then you have to be
the stronger one

01:54:35.101 --> 01:54:36.205
Okay?

01:54:37.604 --> 01:54:40.881
» Okay?
» Okay

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:33.297
Thanks
Good Job on the mm

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:38.803
Thanks

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:56.754
Hey, Ayan!

02:00:57.917 --> 02:00:59.521
<i>7</i> Hey, Am

02:01:00.419 --> 02:01:02.695
- Avoiding me?
- Avoid... no...

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:04.557
Congratulations...
You sang really well...

02:01:04.757 --> 02:01:05.599
Thanks

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:07.900
Looks like you're doing well...

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:11.065
Well, I couldn't be
Mohammad Rafi...

02:01:11.364 --> 02:01:13.708
...but I've found some
love on the internet...

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:15.137
<i>Great</i>

02:01:16.168 --> 02:01:18.808
- All good, otherwise?
- Yeah, all good... Superb...

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:24.981
<i>Sorry</i>

02:01:25.278 --> 02:01:27.417
I'm finding this
formality really funny...

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:32.122
The truth is that I'd been
hoping to run into you...

02:01:32.385 --> 02:01:33.955
So I could beat you up...

02:01:35.721 --> 02:01:38.964
You have no idea how much
I wanted to beat you up, DJ Ali!

02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:41.770
Nice...

02:01:42.395 --> 02:01:43.806
Why'd you feel that way?

02:01:44.196 --> 02:01:45.573
Because of how you rem

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.174
Your love was so strong that
mine couldn't live up to it.

02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:53.780
What else have
I ever done...

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:56.452
Sang some songs...
and fell in love.

02:01:57.943 --> 02:01:59.286
'(owe fortunate

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:03.390
Not everyone can love
so faithfully...

02:02:06.485 --> 02:02:07.759
How's Alizeh doing?

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.239
You're serious?
You don't know?

02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:18.231
I don't know... what?

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:22.778
Congratulations, man...

02:02:23.002 --> 02:02:24.310
She left me.

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:35.292
Maybe I couldn't love
her the way she wanted me to...

02:02:36.382 --> 02:02:37.986
I haven't seen her in two years...

02:02:39.018 --> 02:02:41.328
Even her parents
haven't heard from her.

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:45.966
Last I heard, she was in London,
but I don't have the details...

02:02:47.259 --> 02:02:48.932
Why didn't she call you?

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:09.387
Everyone knows love is crooked...

02:03:09.949 --> 02:03:12.395
But to find peace
in that crooked love...

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:14.258
...is a gift only few have.

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:15.896
- This?!'

02:03:16.255 --> 02:03:18.064
'This is my happy place!'

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:21.401
And when there's nothing left...

02:03:22.228 --> 02:03:24.936
they find SheKer
H'! that crookedness

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:29.072
'I come here when the
world gets too much...'

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:31.377
Crooked love.

02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:34.642
'When I want to spend
time with myself...'

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:38.953
'Because this is the only
place on earth that knows...'

02:03:39.044 --> 02:03:40.887
'...that love is crooked...'

02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:42.548
'Crooked '

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:00.159
<i>A? am?</i>

02:05:04.163 --> 02:05:05.335

L-li!

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:29.960

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:32.029
Where the hell were you?!

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.633
Where the hell were you?!

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:39.738
No one m a due
Where you are

02:05:40.299 --> 02:05:41.801
Who are you?

02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:45.079
Malaysian Airlines?

02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:48.414
You think it'll make a
difference if you disappear?!

02:05:49.441 --> 02:05:51.921
I've been lying here for
2 days like a homeless man...

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:53.717
I'm frozen through!

02:05:53.812 --> 02:05:56.918
This is the cone and
this is the ice cream!

02:05:57.816 --> 02:06:00.558
Haven't eaten, haven't slept...
Not used the loo for any business!

02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:02.597
What if you'd showed up?!

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:04.725
- Where the hell were you?!
- Slap you!

02:06:10.796 --> 02:06:12.366
Why'd you shave your head?!

02:06:17.903 --> 02:06:19.246
Why are you new

02:06:20.072 --> 02:06:21.710
I'm dying, you idiot!

<i>Wham</i>

At least give me a hug!

02:06:46.532 --> 02:06:48.068
Dying means what?

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:50.374
What do you mean dying?!

02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.289
Love is like cancer.

02:07:04.450 --> 02:07:06.327
Comes without warning...

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:08.787
...and destroys you in its wake.

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:13.233
This can't be happening, Alizeh...

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:19.573
Well. .. It's happened.

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:28.308
I thought I was so cool...

02:07:30.009 --> 02:07:32.819
Love turned me
into such a loser.

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:39.156
Ali was making me act insane...

02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:42.532
From checking his phone,
to following him around...

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:47.668
- I'd stopped being his wife
to act like a parole officer.

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:51.906
I can't even really complain...

02:07:55.034 --> 02:07:57.708
I was even willing
to overlook the cheating...

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:01.150
Thankfully...

02:08:01.974 --> 02:08:05.148
I finally gathered the
last shreds of my dignity...

02:08:07.613 --> 02:08:08.887
Wand left him.

02:08:09.748 --> 02:08:13.059
- I decided that my husband does
not control my self-worth.

02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:19.234
All that anger, hatred,
balled up in my throat...

02:08:21.527 --> 02:08:24.303
I dismissed it as an
effect of the circumstance...

02:08:25.564 --> 02:08:27.737
The doctors called it cancer.

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:30.072
- Straight to 4th stage!

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:36.884
I never even scored
that high in school, man!

02:08:38.811 --> 02:08:40.882
But look at you!

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:45.590
You've gone from just
Ayan Sanger to Mr. Ayan Singer!

02:08:48.887 --> 02:08:53.165
If you even think of dying...
I'll kill you.

02:08:55.427 --> 02:08:59.102
Now that you're here...
I don't ever want to die.

02:09:46.612 --> 02:09:47.784
So, ma: Wm you have?

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:51.258
Hi... Just some muesli
with strawberries, please.

02:09:51.316 --> 02:09:53.853
- Muesli with strawberries...

02:09:53.986 --> 02:09:55.761
<i>7</i> And how about you?

02:09:56.355 --> 02:09:57.459
Same!

02:09:57.923 --> 02:09:59.266
» Okay

02:10:10.636 --> 02:10:13.276
Oh, nothing...
Just donated my hair online...

02:10:14.206 --> 02:10:16.186
BMW 00m?

02:10:16.608 --> 02:10:20.112
May this bald head shower
you with blessings...

02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:22.981
Cool.

02:10:35.928 --> 02:10:37.305
Seriously?

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:41.176
You call that a reaction?
So low-key?

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:46.481
Alizeh, I just donated my hair...
And you're giving me an lrfan Khan stare?

02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:49.645
A little over-the-top won't hurt!

02:10:50.342 --> 02:10:52.447
Ayan, have you gone nuts?

02:10:53.345 --> 02:10:55.052
Take a look at yourself!

02:10:56.481 --> 02:10:58.392
You look hot, man!

02:10:58.884 --> 02:10:59.794
Hon

02:11:00.352 --> 02:11:03.731
You'll be fighting girls off...
We'll have to call security!

02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:08.003
Seriously?!

02:11:09.628 --> 02:11:11.437
- Really?!
- Yeah!

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:16.412
- Should I come there to try my luck?
- Come on over!

02:11:20.539 --> 02:11:22.143
You're mad!

02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:27.916
Goodbye, hairbrush!

02:11:30.349 --> 02:11:31.350
Now, listen...

02:11:32.618 --> 02:11:34.120
I have no real religion...

02:11:34.353 --> 02:11:36.026
But I only believe in one religion.

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:38.093
R.D. Burmarrs music!

02:11:39.491 --> 02:11:44.440
If we both look like Captain Pioard anyway...
let the Starship Enterprise fly!

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:48.710
Were young, were free
and were ready

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:51.175
...to let the freak flag fly...

02:11:51.236 --> 02:11:53.546
...with Jolly Good Bollywood!

02:15:30.622 --> 02:15:33.000
Your tea, madam!

02:15:34.126 --> 02:15:36.470
Careful, it's hot!

02:15:41.666 --> 02:15:43.304
<i>7</i> m <i>n</i> bum you?
<i>7</i> A me

02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:52.679
"Hi!

02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:15.208
Ayan

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:18.906
<i>Sorry</i>

02:16:29.381 --> 02:16:32.055
Actually, sorry but I'm not sorry.

02:16:34.186 --> 02:16:36.063
What do you Wm from me?

02:16:37.556 --> 02:16:38.727
What do <i>\</i> do?

02:16:39.958 --> 02:16:42.939
You think I'm dying
to sleep with you...

02:16:46.498 --> 02:16:49.103
I'm dying for you to love me...

02:16:50.402 --> 02:16:51.642
I've tried everything...

02:16:51.736 --> 02:16:55.148
Staying away, staying close,
another relationship...

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:59.347
But I can't...
I can't get you out of my head!

02:17:02.746 --> 02:17:05.455
What does DJ Ali have that I don't?

02:17:06.951 --> 02:17:11.367
If I get some tattoos
and start spouting poetry...

02:17:11.423 --> 02:17:13.232
Will you love me then?

02:17:14.325 --> 02:17:18.468
Will I finally be worthy of your love?

02:17:19.164 --> 02:17:20.700
Because W do M

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:22.768
<i>\</i> can do M

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:30.710
I'm talking to you.

02:17:31.675 --> 02:17:33.383
Yeah, run away

02:17:34.312 --> 02:17:36.223
Not like you have anything to say...

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:37.852
AhZeh

02:17:42.654 --> 02:17:44.861
- I can break things, too!
- That's a pressure cooker!

02:17:44.923 --> 02:17:46.869
Let M burst them

02:17:48.393 --> 02:17:49.929
What do you want me to do?!

02:17:50.128 --> 02:17:51.766
- Lie to you?
- Yes, lie to me!

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:54.342
- I can't lie!
- Why not?! You're dying, anyway!

02:17:54.398 --> 02:17:57.004
Live or die, I will not lie to you!

02:17:57.067 --> 02:18:00.879
This is the only honest thing
in my life, Ayan!

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:02.882
Can't you love me
instead of DJ Ali?

02:18:04.476 --> 02:18:06.456
This IS love, Ayan...

02:18:06.678 --> 02:18:11.023
- This isn't love.
- This IS love for me, Ayan!

02:18:11.616 --> 02:18:17.861
Ayan, this is bigger than love...
This is the greatest love of my life.

02:18:18.923 --> 02:18:20.596
I don't want this kind of love.

02:18:21.558 --> 02:18:25.063
You're my friend...

02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:27.241
My <i>famW</i>

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:29.101
My everything!

02:18:29.367 --> 02:18:30.846
You're just not my lover.

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:34.344
Why not?
I can be your lover, too!

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:35.749
<i>Warm</i>

02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:39.148
That kind of love has only destroyed me...
Do you want to be destroyed?!

02:18:39.244 --> 02:18:43.420
Yes, I do.
I want to be destroyed.

02:18:44.014 --> 02:18:47.155
This thing we have between us...
Our friendship...

02:18:47.485 --> 02:18:49.761
n: my greatest strength

02:18:50.322 --> 02:18:52.734
Love is my weakness...

02:18:53.391 --> 02:18:55.495
Why don't you understand that?

02:18:55.760 --> 02:19:00.402
Because a man and a woman
cannot be just friends!

02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:13.755
Go...

02:19:13.912 --> 02:19:15.549
Gel out of here

02:19:16.246 --> 02:19:17.521
Go.

02:19:17.682 --> 02:19:20.924
I can't explain this to you anymore...

02:19:21.019 --> 02:19:24.432
If you can't understand, just leave...

02:19:24.656 --> 02:19:27.898
Take your stuff and get out!

02:19:29.561 --> 02:19:30.630
Get out!

02:19:30.762 --> 02:19:32.434
Get out, Ayan!

02:19:39.603 --> 02:19:40.708
AhZeh

02:19:42.707 --> 02:19:44.118
<i>Ahleh, I'm sorry</i>

02:19:55.387 --> 02:19:58.266
It's a strange story...
of Love and Friendship.

02:19:58.757 --> 02:20:01.465
Love, the hero...
and Friendship, the heroine.

02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:04.998
The awful thing is that
Love never understood Friendship.

02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:09.576
'I do love you, Ayan...
Just not the way you want me to.'

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:11.677
- 'Love is passion...'

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:15.610
- '...but friendship is peace.'

02:20:18.576 --> 02:20:23.150
One night, tired and weary,
Love threw a tantrum...

02:20:23.982 --> 02:20:25.518
Like a spoilt child... Stupid!

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:27.760
And what did Friendship do?

02:20:29.754 --> 02:20:30.698
AhZeh

02:20:31.089 --> 02:20:34.161
Friendship threw a tantrum, too,
and left in a huff.

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:39.935
And where else do heroines go?

02:20:40.732 --> 02:20:41.642
The airport.

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:44.977
- 'Ayah... I'm going back home...'

02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:47.341
And Love freaked out

02:20:47.505 --> 02:20:51.146
- 'I hope one clay you'll
understand my love...'

02:20:51.443 --> 02:20:55.152
When Love realised that Friendship
is leaving him forever... He ran.

02:20:55.513 --> 02:20:58.323
And how he ram

02:21:03.288 --> 02:21:04.164
H'! tam

02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:05.459

02:21:17.936 --> 02:21:19.882
He didn't stop to breathe...

02:21:21.172 --> 02:21:24.881
Because Love knew...
Friendship was about to breathe her last...

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:29.154
And he wanted to be with
her 'til her last moments.

02:21:29.948 --> 02:21:31.291
That was Love's right.

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:44.804
I need to get to BA 109!

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:48.841
I'm sorry, the gate closed
2O minutes ago!

02:21:48.933 --> 02:21:50.378
