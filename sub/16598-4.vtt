WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.970
Previously, on The Exorcist...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.572
We believe an exorcism should be
granted.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.874
This girl needs psychiatric
attention.

00:06.907 --> 00:10.711
Your excommunication-- you're
to relinquish your collar,

00:10.744 --> 00:13.081
your right to serve mass,
to take communion.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.851
MARCUS: The string of murders
on the south side of the city.

00:17.885 --> 00:21.322
Nine victims, Bennett.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.657
Heart, eyes, genitals,
hands and feet

00:23.691 --> 00:27.161
are materials needed to perform
vicari pulvari.

00:27.195 --> 00:29.163
Has the church been compromised?

00:29.197 --> 00:30.664
I don't know.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.833
BENNETT: You have some friends
in this town.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.203
They can help you.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.404
Father Marcus,

00:36.437 --> 00:38.572
the one we feared,

00:38.606 --> 00:41.575
until you lost that little boy.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.113
Who's Jessica?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.948
What else don't I know about?
'Cause the demon will.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.283
MARCUS:
Break it off with her, Thomas.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.551
How's Jim?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.286
It's not fine, you know this.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.588
I-I can't then.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.590
For Saint Anthony's,

00:56.624 --> 00:58.792
and your not-depleted parish.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.464
You want it rough,
all you got to do ask.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.738
Oh!

01:12.473 --> 01:14.942
(screams)

01:14.975 --> 01:16.177
HENRY (distant):
Casey!

01:17.445 --> 01:19.413
*

01:19.447 --> 01:22.216
ANGELA:
Casey?

01:22.250 --> 01:23.551
(sing-songy):
Casey!

01:23.584 --> 01:25.586
* Well, come along boys
and listen to my tale *

01:25.619 --> 01:27.821
* I'll tell you all my troubles
on the old Chisholm Trail *

01:27.855 --> 01:29.757
* Come a Ki-yi-yippee-yay,
yippee-yay *

01:29.790 --> 01:31.225
Mom?

01:31.259 --> 01:33.961
You gave me a start, sweetheart.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.429
You certainly took your time

01:35.463 --> 01:37.631
getting up this morning,
didn't you?

01:37.665 --> 01:40.234
You know what they say,

01:40.268 --> 01:42.636
the last one up is a rotten egg.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.005
You're cooking?

01:45.038 --> 01:47.741
Don't act so surprised.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.110
Your favorite omelet.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.582
(quietly gasps)
Ooh, that's lucky.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.084
Why don't you go join your
Father and sister at the table?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.119
This will be ready in a jiff.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.524
Dad, what are you doing?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.259
Just my job, Button.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.360
Don't be jealous, Case.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.496
HENRY:
It's true, Button.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.631
Every girl can't be a swan.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.200
ANGELA:
Okay.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.134
Dig in, Buttercup.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.805
(gasps)

02:17.838 --> 02:20.040
You're being ungracious, dear.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.776
Not to mention rude

02:22.810 --> 02:25.446
to your family.
(mouthing)

02:25.479 --> 02:28.449
Picky eaters, they grow
up to be depressives

02:28.482 --> 02:31.485
and sexual anorexics,
you know.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.156
Try it. You'll like it.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.700
Why resist, darling?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.469
This isn't like you said
it'd be.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.770
Something's not right here.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.876
(grunting)

02:55.909 --> 02:57.911
(panting)

02:59.613 --> 03:02.250
See what you made me do?

03:02.283 --> 03:04.585
Do you think I want to hurt you?

03:04.618 --> 03:06.487
(grunts)

03:06.520 --> 03:08.689
(panting)

03:10.758 --> 03:13.927
(whimpers)
You force me to do this
when you resist.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.263
Now,

03:15.296 --> 03:16.930
I know it's difficult,

03:16.964 --> 03:20.368
but you really must give in
completely.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.169
So say yes.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.738
One tiny
little word.

03:24.772 --> 03:28.108
Yes...

03:28.141 --> 03:31.912
No, no! No! No!
Casey.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.782
No! No!
Casey.

03:34.815 --> 03:38.619
(crying)
No.
Casey.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.489
*

04:11.352 --> 04:12.820
72 hours?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.422
That is the length
of the hold, yes.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.956
Are you saying there's nothing
we can do about that?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.791
(sighs) This incident
on the train,

04:17.825 --> 04:21.595
um, the police have
the authority to

04:21.629 --> 04:23.397
involuntarily confine
someone like your daughter,

04:23.431 --> 04:25.566
who may be a danger
to herself or others.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.568
No, you don't
understand.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.269
E.R. cleaned her up.
We'll evaluate her.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.071
We're gonna do everything
we can for your daughter.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.606
When can we see her?

04:32.640 --> 04:36.610
Right. Um, there's
no visitors allowed on a 5150.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.079
But you are welcome to stay here
if you want, long as you like.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.615
She's in great hands.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.086
I mean, maybe this
is a good thing.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.321
They're gonna do tests

04:47.355 --> 04:49.623
and figure out
what's wrong with her.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.191
I'm gonna get
everyone coffee.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.693
Henry, this hospital...

04:52.726 --> 04:55.363
It was the closest one
to the train.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.365
It's gonna be fine.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.640
(line ringing)

05:20.888 --> 05:22.690
(knocking)

05:25.993 --> 05:27.961
May I help you?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.397
Good morning, Sister.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.565
I was hoping that I might speak
with the abbess.

05:31.599 --> 05:34.034
The abbess has taken
a vow of silence.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.036
Oh, of course.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.706
Uh, what time
is her hour of respite?

05:38.739 --> 05:40.708
She does take one, doesn't she?

05:40.741 --> 05:43.377
Otherwise, I mean,
she'd go a bit (hums)

05:43.411 --> 05:44.912
Mother Bernadette

05:44.945 --> 05:45.913
is very busy.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.548
She rarely accepts visitors.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.418
Bennett sent me.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.253
My name's
Marcus Keane.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.756
The garden.
Around the side.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.596
(indistinct chatter)

06:06.967 --> 06:09.002
Excuse me for one sec.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.338
Henry, I came
as soon as I heard.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.540
Are you okay?
Me?

06:12.573 --> 06:14.842
I don't know. But Casey--

06:14.875 --> 06:17.077
I've never seen anything
like it.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.247
Father, did the bishop
approve the exorcism?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.720
They were not convinced.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.388
They said no?

06:28.422 --> 06:31.391
I've been forbidden from...

06:31.425 --> 06:34.795
taking further action other
than prayer and advisement.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.197
So what you're saying is
you're useless to us.
HENRY: Ange.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.099
I'm doing

06:39.132 --> 06:41.469
everything I can.
What about your
friend, Marcus?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.270
If you can't help us.
maybe he can.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.605
Marcus is gone, excommunicated.

06:44.638 --> 06:48.809
So, yes, unfortunately,
I'm all you got.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.613
Father, these doctors
are telling me

06:52.646 --> 06:54.448
that I can't do anything
for her.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.217
I can't even see her
for the next...

06:57.250 --> 06:58.251
60-something hours.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.487
And the longer
she's in there,

06:59.520 --> 07:00.921
this thing festers.

07:00.954 --> 07:04.091
Please, doctors and tests

07:04.124 --> 07:05.893
are not what she needs.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.596
This isn't
fair, Father.
I will find a way.

07:08.629 --> 07:13.033
There is someone
I can talk to.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.671
Have faith in me.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.977
* Like the moon

07:24.011 --> 07:25.746
* Mmm

07:25.779 --> 07:30.417
* Shining its face...

07:30.450 --> 07:34.755
* Seems so near...

07:34.788 --> 07:39.760
* Yet so far away...

07:39.793 --> 07:42.129
* But that's the way love is

07:42.162 --> 07:44.498
* That's the way love is *

07:44.532 --> 07:46.333
* Day after day

07:46.366 --> 07:48.969
* Day after day *

07:49.002 --> 07:53.707
* It's so near...

07:53.741 --> 07:57.978
* But yet so far away...

07:58.011 --> 08:03.350
* So far away.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.890
ANGELA:
How is she?

08:09.923 --> 08:11.692
DOCTOR: Uh, well,
we've made some progress.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.326
There's
no intracranial bleeding

08:13.360 --> 08:14.361
or temporal lobe epilepsy.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.729
So, progress
in terms

08:15.763 --> 08:17.130
of ruling things out.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.465
Find anything you'd rule in?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.833
It's a process, Mrs. Rance.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.302
She's severely dehydrated,
and...

08:22.335 --> 08:25.472
there is the genital trauma.
(whimpering)

08:25.505 --> 08:27.007
Genital trauma?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.475
We found

08:28.508 --> 08:29.577
burns.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.012
I don't understand.
Who are you?

08:32.045 --> 08:33.681
Dr. Rho,
psychiatric attending.

08:33.714 --> 08:37.150
We're concerned the trauma
might be self-inflicted.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.852
Is there history of

08:38.886 --> 08:41.589
mental illness in the family?
Schizophrenia...

08:41.622 --> 08:42.923
No mental illness.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.725
What I don't understand
is this law

08:44.758 --> 08:47.260
that allows you to stumble
around looking for explanations,

08:47.294 --> 08:49.763
when, clearly,
she's not getting better.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.565
I understand your frustration.
We're frustrated, too.

08:51.599 --> 08:52.700
But there are

08:52.733 --> 08:54.702
some more tests we can run.
And in the meantime,

08:54.735 --> 08:56.203
we're giving her fluids
and we're keeping her

08:56.236 --> 08:58.105
as comfortable as...

09:00.540 --> 09:02.075
Just hang in there.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.585
(nuns singing)

09:24.598 --> 09:26.900
Watch.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.970
(singing continues)

09:30.003 --> 09:32.005
(man snarling)

09:45.452 --> 09:47.454
(snarling continues)

09:58.465 --> 09:59.933
(singing stops)

09:59.967 --> 10:01.635
(snarling)

10:01.669 --> 10:02.970
Holy Mary.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.404
ALL:
Holy Mary.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.774
Holy Mother of God.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.241
ALL:
Mother of the Church.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.410
NUN:
Mother of Divine Grace.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.245
ALL:
Mother most pure.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.781
NUN:
Mother most chaste.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.082
ALL:
Mother inviolate.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.084
(growls)
(shouts)

10:17.117 --> 10:18.786
NUN:
Mother undefiled.
ALL: Mother most amiable.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.954
NUN:
Mother most admirable.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.656
ALL:
Mother of good counsel.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.491
Mother of our Creator.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.859
ALL:
Mother of our Savior.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.594
(low growling)

10:27.627 --> 10:32.332
NUNS:
O vriziol maiz, offeret hoc
liuionz limix.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.034
Brazchia inferorum...
(roaring)

10:34.067 --> 10:35.202
(groans)

10:35.235 --> 10:37.004
reverta ad tronziol...

10:37.037 --> 10:41.141
(low growling)
Ninxia nigrum,
liberati a conchsis.

10:41.174 --> 10:46.213
Son of the morning,
banished from grace.
(low growling)

10:46.246 --> 10:48.648
Profane thing,
ashes on the earth.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.618
(groaning)
You are relieved, outcast.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.321
Fallen angel, you are loved.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.529
(low groaning)

11:04.197 --> 11:06.700
(low groaning)

11:06.734 --> 11:09.002
Restrain him before
he rises again.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.381
We must go.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.784
Come with me.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.595
(snoring)

11:35.628 --> 11:37.530
Oh.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.432
Is the abbess ready
to receive me?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.368
The abbess is resting.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.403
So was I.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.439
The sisters have

11:46.473 --> 11:49.042
work to do in the garden...

11:49.076 --> 11:52.545
and your presence is...
undesired.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.282
There's a... a young woman

11:55.315 --> 11:59.953
whose life might depend
on my speaking with her.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.521
There are many who depend
on Mother Bernadette's aid.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.224
She'll speak to you
when she's ready.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.227
Does she know
Bennett sent me?

12:07.260 --> 12:10.397
I don't suppose
I could use your...

12:10.430 --> 12:12.499
Nuns. Bog.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.602
(sniffles)

12:25.745 --> 12:27.747
"Rego."

12:30.117 --> 12:32.619
(rhythmic beeping)
Miss Faye knows you're sad,

12:32.652 --> 12:34.922
but God don't
put us through nothing

12:34.955 --> 12:37.090
that we cannot bear,
pretty thing.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.660
You got to get stronger if
you want to get out of here.

12:40.693 --> 12:44.798
Isn't she sweet?
She called you "pretty."

12:44.832 --> 12:46.433
Take a deep
breath for me.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.935
You won't feel a thing.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.803
(hissing)

12:49.837 --> 12:51.805
(groans softly)
No one in their right mind

12:51.839 --> 12:53.640
would call you "pretty" now.

12:53.673 --> 12:56.743
If I had a mirror, you'd see
what resistance is doing

12:56.776 --> 12:57.945
to your lilac face,

12:57.978 --> 12:59.980
your snow white body.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.348
(hissing)
That's strange.
Can't find a vein.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.116
(pained groan)

13:03.150 --> 13:04.617
It'll be in
in a minute.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.187
Just one more try.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.488
You're doing this to me.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.458
I was making you perfect.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.860
You tricked me.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.694
Oh, I'm sorry.
This never happens.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.297
(groaning)
Now, don't you

13:17.330 --> 13:19.199
tire yourself out talking,
angel.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.667
You save your strength.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.669
When you stop fighting it,

13:22.702 --> 13:24.637
the pain goes away...

13:24.671 --> 13:26.373
(hissing)

13:26.406 --> 13:29.376
...and you and I can dance
a dark floor,

13:29.409 --> 13:32.479
tip tap, tippity

13:32.512 --> 13:35.815
tap. Tip. Tap.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.484
I don't believe you.
Shh.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.154
Shh. Shh.
It's all over now, pumpkin.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.956
You'll feel better
soon, I promise.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.691
(humming)

13:44.724 --> 13:46.226
I couldn't agree more.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.694
(gasps)

13:47.727 --> 13:49.997
(hissing)

13:50.030 --> 13:51.464
(groaning)

13:51.498 --> 13:54.367
(whimpers)

13:54.401 --> 13:55.869
(tinny, old-fashioned
piano music plays)

13:55.903 --> 13:57.204
WOMAN:
"I was born

13:57.237 --> 13:59.206
"with the devil in me.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.741
"I could not help the fact
that I was a murderer,

14:01.774 --> 14:03.676
"no more than the
poet can help

14:03.710 --> 14:04.878
the inspiration to sing."

14:04.912 --> 14:06.346
(female scream on tape)

14:06.379 --> 14:08.315
WOMAN:
The depraved individual

14:08.348 --> 14:10.183
who wrote those
bone-chilling words

14:10.217 --> 14:14.421
was none other than Chicago's
most notorious serial killer,

14:14.454 --> 14:16.890
H.H. Holmes, AKA,

14:16.924 --> 14:19.526
"The Devil in the White City."

14:19.559 --> 14:21.194
I read that book.
WOMAN:
You did?

14:21.228 --> 14:23.030
Good for you.
Don't interrupt.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.366
Chicago has always
attracted the sinful,

14:26.399 --> 14:28.735
the savage, the sadistic.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.403
Nurse-killer, Richard Speck.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.939
(scream)
Killer clown

14:31.972 --> 14:33.540
John Wayne Gacy.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.541
(scream)

14:34.574 --> 14:37.210
But none of them
could compare in sheer

14:37.244 --> 14:40.447
wickedness
to Dr. Henry H. Holmes.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.348
(scream)

14:41.381 --> 14:43.250
No, Lester. We cut that one.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.551
No. I don't think
we did.
We did.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.554
Unbelievable.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.956
Where was I?

14:48.989 --> 14:50.557
Um, Holmes would
butcher and dissect

14:50.590 --> 14:52.025
the corpses of
those he killed...

14:52.059 --> 14:54.094
There were
ritual dismemberments?

14:54.127 --> 14:56.063
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry. I said no...

14:56.096 --> 14:57.430
Did they include the heart,
the liver,

14:57.464 --> 14:58.898
or the genitals?
LESTER:
We'll let you know

14:58.932 --> 15:01.901
when it's time to ask
the questions, chief.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.603
Go on.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.283
HENRY:
Hey, there you are.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.418
Oh. Hey.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.921
Oh, sorry. I should have
told you where I was going.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.957
That's all right.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.427
I don't need supervision
at all times.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.928
I... I didn't mean that.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.597
I'm kidding.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.268
I told Kat to go home,

15:35.302 --> 15:38.138
take a shower, change clothes.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.140
Maybe we should, too.
Hmm.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.977
36 more hours.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.148
Remember the time
we took the girls to Maine?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.952
Yeah, uh... Algonquin?

15:52.986 --> 15:54.121
Ogunquit.
Uh, Ogunquit.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.423
Ogunquit.
(laughs)

15:56.456 --> 15:58.858
I've never told you this,

15:58.891 --> 16:02.195
but on the drive home,
you were taking a nap.

16:02.229 --> 16:05.298
I pulled off
at this rest stop.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.334
Kat wanted something
out of the...

16:10.670 --> 16:12.305
You put the coins in?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.707
Vending machine.
Yeah.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.977
I turn around,
Casey's not there.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.113
So I look for her.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.482
She's not in the bathroom,
she's not in the car.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.884
Then I see her

16:24.917 --> 16:29.222
standing by the side
of the freeway...

16:29.256 --> 16:31.191
cars just flying past.
Oh.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.193
(imitates whooshing)
(whispers):
Oh, God.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.195
She's picking flowers.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.031
That's the most scared

16:38.065 --> 16:40.067
I've ever been.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.736
Until last night.

16:43.770 --> 16:47.540
What she did on the train--

16:47.574 --> 16:50.043
that wasn't Casey.
Huh.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.379
So when she gets out of here,

16:52.412 --> 16:57.016
whatever you think is the best
thing to do-- with Father Tomas,

16:57.050 --> 17:00.553
or Marcus or-- I'm on board.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.557
Mm.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.559
But for now,

17:06.593 --> 17:08.195
we should go home.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.232
(speaking Spanish)

17:13.233 --> 17:14.401
Thank you.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.103
And who is this?

17:16.136 --> 17:18.538
(speaking Spanish)

17:18.571 --> 17:21.174
Uh, he is my little
nephew, Luis.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.210
Uh, sometimes
he's a little bit shy.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.245
Aren't you a sturdy young man?
(phone dings)

17:25.278 --> 17:27.614
(phone buzzes)
I'll tell you what, Luis.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.249
Why don't you follow Karen
to the kitchen,

17:29.282 --> 17:32.419
and she'll have Philippe make
you whatever treat you like.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.053
Within reason.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.988
Within reason, of course.
Thank you.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.826
(whispers)

17:41.928 --> 17:43.530
I am really sorry.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.632
My sister-- she works
a lot of jobs, temps.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.634
She never knows her
schedule in advance.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.402
It sounds difficult.

17:49.436 --> 17:53.072
Well, being a single mom is,
but I'm sure you can imagine.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.542
I can't, actually.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.445
George wasn't interested in
having children when we married.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.581
But even if he wanted to,
I suppose I was a bit

18:01.614 --> 18:05.084
"past my prime," would be
the delicate way to put it.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.953
But you didn't come here
to listen to me rattle on.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.121
What did you want

18:08.155 --> 18:09.989
to discuss?
Yes. Uh,

18:10.022 --> 18:12.058
there is a girl in my parish,

18:12.091 --> 18:15.495
and I would like to
perform a service for her,

18:15.528 --> 18:17.797
but Bishop
Egan-- he's...

18:17.830 --> 18:20.933
tied my hands,

18:20.967 --> 18:23.336
so...
So?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.773
I thought maybe if I
could bring my case

18:26.806 --> 18:28.608
to the cardinal, maybe...

18:28.641 --> 18:31.644
You want to go
above Egan's head?

18:31.678 --> 18:34.181
Devious, Father.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.449
I mean it as a compliment.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.685
Ah.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.420
(rhythmic beeping and whooshing)

18:40.453 --> 18:42.455
(moaning)

18:43.723 --> 18:45.658
(moaning continues)

18:45.692 --> 18:49.028
This service
you want to perform--

18:49.061 --> 18:51.030
is it the right thing to do?

18:51.063 --> 18:54.033
I believe it is the right thing.
It may be the only thing.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.869
WOMAN:
Follow your impulses,
and keep it quiet.

18:56.903 --> 19:00.540
(beeping and whooshing)
Nobody has more respect
for the church than me.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.175
(rattled breathing)

19:02.209 --> 19:04.811
But we can both admit,
they're hardly infallible.
(moaning)

19:06.713 --> 19:08.715
(groaning)

19:08.748 --> 19:12.385
(beeping)

19:12.419 --> 19:13.653
Uncle Tomas.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.355
(speaking Spanish)

19:15.388 --> 19:16.856
There's a scary
man in there.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.858
(Tomas speaks Spanish)

19:20.227 --> 19:23.162
Um... we've taken enough
of your time.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.631
I appreciate the advice.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.233
Uh... thank you.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.201
Anytime.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.371
I noticed you hadn't cashed
my check yet, Father.

19:31.404 --> 19:35.074
Yes. Uh, first thing
in the morning.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.545
Thank you.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.581
(speaking Spanish)
I don't like it here.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.579
*

20:31.097 --> 20:33.099
Tara?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.736
Can you deposit

20:36.769 --> 20:39.439
this check first thing
tomorrow morning, please?

20:39.472 --> 20:42.375
Uh, when, since when do
we get six-figure checks?

20:42.409 --> 20:43.943
It's a big one, I know.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.579
You sure we're not laundering
money for the Mob here?

20:46.613 --> 20:48.448
90% sure.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.961
(sighs)

21:12.038 --> 21:13.440
(knocking)

21:13.473 --> 21:16.175
Yes?

21:16.208 --> 21:18.545
(door opens)

21:20.647 --> 21:22.482
Jessica.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.252
(indistinct chatter)

21:26.285 --> 21:27.520
(sighs heavily)

21:27.554 --> 21:29.789
Let me know when
you have her intubated.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.290
What's going on?

21:31.324 --> 21:33.960
Well, unfortunately, she's not
retaining fluids or eating.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.963
So I am having the nurses
put in a feeding tube.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.165
No. No.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry,

21:39.198 --> 21:40.500
Mrs. Rance,

21:40.533 --> 21:42.802
but under the hold,
I don't require your permission.

21:42.835 --> 21:46.339
She is ours for one more day,
and the decision is mine.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.310
(crying)

21:54.381 --> 21:56.716
(Casey continues crying)

22:00.186 --> 22:03.490
It's not like
I was even looking for it.

22:03.523 --> 22:06.659
He accidently sends me
a text meant for her,

22:06.693 --> 22:10.162
with emojis, like
a 13-year-old.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.731
I play along.

22:11.764 --> 22:15.167
He doesn't figure out it's
me for, like, ten minutes.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.870
I come home. I confront him.

22:17.904 --> 22:21.708
He tries to pretend he doesn't
know what I'm talking about.

22:21.741 --> 22:24.877
I show him my phone,
then he gives up.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.480
And you and me?

22:27.514 --> 22:30.483
Tortured for writing letters,
and all that time, Jim's...

22:30.517 --> 22:32.184
No, no, this...

22:32.218 --> 22:34.220
this wasn't your fault.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.224
Are you sure about that?

22:40.092 --> 22:42.061
I need to be at work
early morning.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.330
I should, um...

22:44.363 --> 22:46.399
I don't know, get a hotel.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.902
God, the thought
of going back there.
No, no,

22:49.936 --> 22:52.739
please stay.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.006
I-I...

22:54.040 --> 22:55.875
you-you can take the bed.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.209
What about you?

22:57.243 --> 22:59.912
(exhales)
I can take the couch.

23:01.047 --> 23:04.050
Uh... probably you think
I am being a gentleman.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.885
I am being a nice person.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.555
But actually
that bed is...

23:08.588 --> 23:10.222
(whispers):
horrible.

23:13.626 --> 23:17.396
(Dixieland jazz playing)
(train whistle blowing)

23:17.430 --> 23:19.098
*

23:21.801 --> 23:23.636
MARCUS:
Is that yours?

23:24.671 --> 23:26.706
That's where
I met Lester.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.241
I was Anthropology.
He was at the Div School.

23:29.275 --> 23:32.612
Eyeballed him in this seminar
on the occult I was auditing.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.981
CO2 plus H2.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.817
Boom. Maybe don't bring up
academia around him.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.819
He never finished his doctorate.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.153
Inaccurate.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.489
I finished.

23:42.522 --> 23:46.092
Those snippety bastards
screwed me out of it.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.794
How do you know Bennett?

23:47.827 --> 23:49.762
He excommunicated me.
(chuckles)

23:49.796 --> 23:51.731
Must have been
on to something big.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.099
That's when they
come for you.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.801
So, what'd you
do to Bennett?
Don't pry.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.268
I'm not prying.
I want to know.

23:56.302 --> 23:57.770
That is the definition
of prying.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.639
I pulled a gun on him...

23:59.672 --> 24:01.608
amongst other things.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.510
A priest with a gun.

24:03.543 --> 24:06.445
An exorcist with a gun...

24:06.479 --> 24:08.781
to be accurate, Cherry.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.250
An exorcist.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.285
You're an exorcist.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.622
So you must have noticed
the surge, then.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.357
If you look,

24:18.390 --> 24:20.927
you see it over and over,
these surges of,

24:20.960 --> 24:22.294
I don't know, whatever
you want to call it,

24:22.328 --> 24:24.463
uh, brutality, carnage.
Demonic activity.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.433
Preceding some truly
cataclysmic event.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.468
Think of England before
the great London fire

24:29.502 --> 24:31.470
in 1666.
666.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.439
Stop right there with your...

24:33.472 --> 24:36.142
numerological "Number of
the Beast" conspiracy bollocks.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.844
Not so good with people,
are you?

24:37.877 --> 24:39.879
The point is,
the pressure builds,

24:39.912 --> 24:42.181
the plates slip,
the earthquake comes,

24:42.214 --> 24:43.983
and Chicago's on the fault
line this time around.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.652
Why Chicago?

24:45.685 --> 24:48.621
(scoffs softly) Evil's
a moveable feast, Padre.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.990
Lucifer and his crew
banished from Heaven.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.125
They're always looking for a
place to set down their bag.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.127
Hey, grab me my folder,
will you there, Doctor?

24:55.161 --> 24:57.329
I don't respond well
to orders, Lester.
Oh, funny,

24:57.363 --> 24:59.331
that's not the tune you
sing in the ol' boudoir.

24:59.365 --> 25:01.067
CHERRY:
Pig.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.703
(groans)

25:04.704 --> 25:06.639
Conditions are ripe.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.340
The homicide rate here
just goes up, up, up.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.876
LESTER:
Consolidate poverty,

25:09.909 --> 25:12.011
and you create these
cultures of violence.

25:12.044 --> 25:15.514
It jumps from one person
to the next like a virus.

25:15.548 --> 25:18.084
If you don't want to be a
victim, you have to be a killer.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.052
CHERRY:
So 4,000 people get shot,
or stabbed,

25:20.086 --> 25:22.188
or fill in the blank this year.
On the bus,

25:22.221 --> 25:23.990
you asked about
dismemberments.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.758
I assume you're making a
connection to the whole

25:25.792 --> 25:29.161
Englewood
murders, right?
Yeah, there were organs...

25:29.195 --> 25:31.530
harvested, specific organs

25:31.564 --> 25:34.400
for a mass called...
Vocare Pulvere.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.103
You know it?

25:37.136 --> 25:38.605
I've seen it.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.607
A professor of mine, Rexroth,

25:40.640 --> 25:43.042
he, uh,
he taught a class on ritual.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.878
Cult of angels, Vocare Pulvere.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.347
Ceremony of ash.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.882
Those organs...

25:49.916 --> 25:51.751
they're only used
for one reason.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.920
MARCUS/LESTER:
A summoning.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.769
What do you know
about Tattersal Landscaping?

26:11.771 --> 26:13.239
JESSICA:
Yeah?

26:13.272 --> 26:15.407
Hi.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.744
Uh... are you okay?

26:17.777 --> 26:19.979
This is weird, right?
I knew this would be weird.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.948
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.283
It's-it's fine.
It's not weird.

26:24.316 --> 26:25.752
(phone vibrating)

26:27.186 --> 26:28.855
Sorry.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.459
Now it's weird.

26:33.492 --> 26:35.628
It's a woman
in my congregation.

26:35.662 --> 26:36.929
I talked at you

26:36.963 --> 26:39.298
for an hour--
come on, tell me, confess.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.599
There is a situation.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.669
This woman, she needs my help.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.170
Um...

26:44.203 --> 26:47.106
the Church told me I cannot,
but I'm gonna do it anyway.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.976
Tomas Ortega...

26:50.009 --> 26:52.244
rule breaka.
You see?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.180
I don't always follow them
like you say.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.515
I take it all back.
(chuckles)

26:59.986 --> 27:02.655
Any other lines
you're thinking of crossing?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.661
(phone vibrating)

27:15.001 --> 27:16.302
Good night.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.037
(whispers):
Good night.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.722
MAN:
Restrain her!

27:35.755 --> 27:36.723
Hold her down!

27:36.756 --> 27:37.990
No.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.458
(gasping breaths)

27:39.491 --> 27:40.827
Steady.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.061
(coughing)

27:43.395 --> 27:44.864
All right, pull
this closer.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.966
IV push.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.568
Hold, hold...

27:49.601 --> 27:51.337
Back.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.972
All right.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.342
Try and relax.
Try and relax, Casey.

28:03.382 --> 28:04.416
Love.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.019
(coughs)

28:07.053 --> 28:09.521
Unconditional love.

28:09.555 --> 28:13.059
It's right there
on the other side of the door.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.561
But you keep staring
through the peephole

28:15.594 --> 28:19.031
as if you
don't deserve it.

28:19.065 --> 28:22.368
I have a sledgehammer
in my pocket.

28:22.401 --> 28:25.872
I will lift it up
and bring it down...

28:25.905 --> 28:28.574
again and again

28:28.607 --> 28:30.743
and again.

28:30.777 --> 28:33.245
Just...

28:33.279 --> 28:35.081
you...

28:35.114 --> 28:36.916
wait.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.525
(whooshing)

28:46.558 --> 28:48.227
(gasps)

28:48.260 --> 28:49.829
(exhales sharply)

28:51.063 --> 28:52.364
(sighs)

28:52.398 --> 28:53.933
Jessica?

29:07.313 --> 29:09.248
"Stronger."

29:10.249 --> 29:11.750
Yeah, right.

29:12.952 --> 29:16.722
I trust you found a
place to hang your hat?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.090
I did indeed.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.126
A pair of tour guides
with a trailer

29:20.159 --> 29:22.895
let me sleep in something
called a "nook."

29:22.929 --> 29:25.564
Bit like a womb.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.634
It's a shame they didn't have
a shower you could use.

29:28.667 --> 29:32.404
If I didn't know better, Sister,
I'd call that flirting.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.907
Well, it's good you
know better, then.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.508
(bell begins tolling)

29:36.542 --> 29:38.044
Mother Bernadette.

29:39.045 --> 29:40.546
Father Marcus.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.783
(bell continues tolling)

29:50.189 --> 29:52.724
A priest walks
into a convent.

29:53.993 --> 29:57.129
The punch line hasn't
occurred to me yet.

29:59.966 --> 30:02.268
These look angry.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.937
The cost of
doing business.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.606
We've tried to grow aloe
vera for such purposes,

30:07.639 --> 30:11.944
but it just doesn't thrive
in a Midwestern climate.

30:11.978 --> 30:15.781
I've noticed that the belladonna
flourishes, though.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.583
What do you use it for?

30:19.485 --> 30:21.453
Extreme cases.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.789
The man I saw yesterday?

30:23.822 --> 30:27.293
Difficult, but not hopeless.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.628
How many days?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.830
It's been a week now.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.069
So...

30:37.103 --> 30:38.938
Marcus Keane.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.709
Father Bennett
speaks admiringly of you.

30:43.742 --> 30:45.577
What's the phrase
he used?

30:45.611 --> 30:48.547
"A pain in my ass."
(laughs)

30:48.580 --> 30:52.518
Yeah, well... the feeling's
mutual, I assure you.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.154
I guess he thought
you could help me.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.090
Bennett suggested
that the church

30:58.124 --> 31:00.826
might have been compromised.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.694
He fears for His Holiness'
safety here.

31:02.728 --> 31:04.763
He's not wrong.

31:04.796 --> 31:08.667
There's been an escalation in
the numbers of the possessed.

31:08.700 --> 31:13.739
To be honest, it's
been a bear keeping up.

31:13.772 --> 31:17.843
And, uh, there's...

31:17.876 --> 31:21.713
a young woman with
a presence more...

31:21.747 --> 31:26.518
sophisticated than any I've seen
in some...

31:26.552 --> 31:28.187
(scoffs)

31:28.220 --> 31:31.023
Actually, I'm a bit
out of practice.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.925
How long?

31:34.060 --> 31:37.196
A year and a half, the last one.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.797
A boy.

31:38.830 --> 31:42.868
I lost him.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.371
I don't lose.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.073
Ever?

31:47.106 --> 31:48.240
Ever.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.375
Well, then,

31:49.408 --> 31:51.677
Welcome to the
Mere Mortals Club.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.215
They took my collar.

31:56.248 --> 32:01.587
Is it the collar and the
wimple that supply our power?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.122
Partly, yeah.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.757
The gift doesn't
reside in you or me.

32:05.791 --> 32:08.460
The gift is God's alone.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.596
These are excuses.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.931
You might do well to
keep your ego out of it.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.967
What am I supposed to do, then?

32:15.001 --> 32:17.569
Use your Litany of Loreto,

32:17.603 --> 32:19.371
the Invocation
of the Virgin Mary?

32:21.273 --> 32:24.943
I suppose you could call ours
a more feminine approach.

32:24.977 --> 32:27.146
Didn't quite work for you,
though, did it?

32:27.179 --> 32:31.450
Well, we're not
quite done, are we?

32:31.483 --> 32:33.119
Where you coerce and compel,

32:33.152 --> 32:35.587
we use compassion,
forgiveness,

32:35.621 --> 32:36.755
and patience.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.823
I'm sorry.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.258
Have you seen how I do it, then?

32:39.291 --> 32:40.759
Do you not coerce and compel?

32:40.792 --> 32:42.628
What? A bit like
you're doing now?

32:44.796 --> 32:46.098
You lost one.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.433
It happens.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.800
Get back up and try again.

32:48.834 --> 32:51.337
What else is there?

32:51.370 --> 32:53.605
Tonight you'll join us.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.142
Oh, will I?

32:58.044 --> 32:59.945
Perhaps after a year and a half,

32:59.978 --> 33:03.815
you might be open
to a new method.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.463
What are you doing?

33:17.496 --> 33:19.031
Illinois
Compiled Statutes.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.466
Emergency Admission
by Certification,

33:20.499 --> 33:22.801
Section 3.610,
right here.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.871
"Not later than 24 hours,
the respondent," that's Casey,

33:25.904 --> 33:29.007
"shall be examined a second time
by a psychiatrist,"

33:29.041 --> 33:30.142
and that didn't happen.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.210
Mom, it did.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.644
No.
Not the way the law states.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.214
Look, "The psychiatrist
shall not be the person

33:35.247 --> 33:37.349
who executed
the first certificate."

33:37.383 --> 33:38.550
They didn't do that.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.852
Okay. You haven't slept
in two days.

33:40.886 --> 33:43.189
Oh, don't you dare tell me that
what I need right now is sleep,

33:43.222 --> 33:44.323
not when your sister

33:44.356 --> 33:45.191
is locked in a...
Angela.

33:46.858 --> 33:47.693
She's going to die.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.729
Do you hear me? She's gonna die
if we don't do something.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.164
And we will do something

33:52.198 --> 33:53.832
as soon as she
gets out of here.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.068
Are you willing to perform
the exorcism?

33:56.102 --> 33:57.169
Whoa!

33:57.203 --> 33:58.337
What are you talking about?

33:58.370 --> 34:00.506
Exorcism?
Who brought up exorcisms?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.174
She's not getting better.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.409
Maybe that's because
she needs specialists,

34:03.442 --> 34:06.212
and not-- no offense--
not priests.

34:06.245 --> 34:07.746
I'm not sure specialists
can help her, Kat.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.649
You weren't on that train.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.221
What happened to not
being able to help?

34:16.922 --> 34:20.192
I cannot do anything...

34:20.226 --> 34:23.529
officially.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.397
(woman singing)

34:25.431 --> 34:29.501
But unofficially?

34:32.971 --> 34:34.940
*

Give place, abominable creature.

Give way to Christ.

you are forgiven.

Profane thing, ashes on the

Outcast, fallen angel,

35:36.134 --> 35:38.470
NUNS:
You are redeemed.

35:38.504 --> 35:40.272
You are loved.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.374
*

35:54.720 --> 35:56.288
(gasps)

35:56.322 --> 35:58.324
Shh.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.496
*

36:28.520 --> 36:31.223
Ungrateful little bitch.

36:31.257 --> 36:34.826
All that potential
just wasting away.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.297
It's practically dripping
out of you.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.204
(groans)

36:46.238 --> 36:47.839
(monitor alarms beeping)

36:47.873 --> 36:51.377
Oh, Jesus Almighty.

37:02.588 --> 37:03.689
Stop it, stop!

37:03.722 --> 37:05.857
This is your doing.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.794
You want it over,
say the word.

37:10.896 --> 37:14.266
Rhymes with bess, kess,

37:14.300 --> 37:17.903
guess, bess.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.204
Please don't kill her, please.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.974
Do you want to save
the sweet nurse, Casey?

37:23.008 --> 37:25.243
All you have to do is say "yes."

37:25.277 --> 37:27.212
Okay, okay, whatever you want.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.747
(monitor alarms beeping)

37:28.780 --> 37:31.750
(panting)

37:31.783 --> 37:36.622
All I ever wanted.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.557
Casey, I'm here.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.459
I'm here, baby, you're okay.

37:40.492 --> 37:41.960
I'm here, I'm right here.

37:41.993 --> 37:42.928
I've got you.

37:42.961 --> 37:46.732
Okay. I'm going to get you
out of here.

37:46.765 --> 37:51.970
Okay, honey, okay, okay.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.448
NURSE:
Devil, you're a liar.

38:02.481 --> 38:06.952
You're a liar.
Ain't no truth in you.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.354
ANGELA:
I want her released
immediately.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.021
There are eight hours
left in the hold.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.523
Oh, no, no.
You screwed up.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.291
Another psychiatrist was
supposed to examine her.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.860
That didn't happen.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.596
And what did happen will
make a very good lawsuit

38:17.629 --> 38:20.198
with your name on it, and
this hospital's name on it.

38:20.231 --> 38:22.834
Fine, I will sign Casey's
discharge papers, Mrs. Rance.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.170
But not because of your
threat, I want you to know,

38:25.203 --> 38:26.505
because I've exhausted
my options here.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.173
I don't know
what else to do.

38:28.206 --> 38:29.775
ANGELA:
Well, finally some
reason out of you.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.309
DOCTOR:
But in my opinion,
your daughter's condition

38:31.343 --> 38:33.178
needs further evaluation.
ANGELA:
"Condition"?

38:33.211 --> 38:35.481
I'm sorry, what
condition is that?

38:35.514 --> 38:38.517
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.552
Okay, honey, let's go.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.427
That's the look of a man
that needs a proper confession.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.196
I'd offer to take it,

38:51.229 --> 38:54.733
but what with
the defrocking and all...

38:54.766 --> 38:57.335
I'm not sure it would count.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.237
You're back.
Yeah, well.

38:59.270 --> 39:02.841
It turns out I've got unfinished
business in Chicago.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.576
Join my club.

39:06.177 --> 39:11.517
"Join the club," I think, is how
our flag-waving friends say it.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.186
You've been practicing?

39:15.220 --> 39:18.023
Yeah.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.358
I take it the demon
has manifested?

39:20.392 --> 39:23.061
Mm-hmm, yes.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.930
So what are you waiting for?

39:24.963 --> 39:27.032
You.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.738
I need you.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.575
Will you help me?

39:36.608 --> 39:39.110
You know what they'll do to you
if they catch on?

39:39.144 --> 39:41.112
You'll lose everything.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.247
I know.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.450
I know.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.784
You're prepared to take this...

39:51.790 --> 39:53.425
As far as it goes.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.728
Good.

39:56.762 --> 39:59.765
Happens to be
the only way I know.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.138
How do you feel?

40:11.242 --> 40:13.211
Big as a mountain.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.747
*

40:15.781 --> 40:19.384
* There's a light in my life

40:19.417 --> 40:23.388
* Shining over me

40:23.421 --> 40:26.625
* There's a light in my life

40:26.658 --> 40:30.496
* Shining over me, yeah

40:30.529 --> 40:34.165
* Let your blessings
from above *

40:34.199 --> 40:38.303
* Fill me
with that precious love *

40:38.336 --> 40:41.139
* There's a light in my life

40:41.172 --> 40:44.810
* Shining over me

40:44.843 --> 40:48.647
* Lord, sometimes
I sit and wonder *

40:48.680 --> 40:52.651
* Why strange things
happen to me *

40:52.684 --> 40:55.787
* Then again I feel

40:55.821 --> 40:59.424
* My friends are gone, yeah

40:59.457 --> 41:01.660
* But if I put my trust

41:01.693 --> 41:03.461
* In Jesus
ALL:
...deliver us from evil.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.631
Amen.

41:05.664 --> 41:08.299
* Don't you see,
there's a light... *

41:08.333 --> 41:11.002
That's quite
a rosary.

41:11.036 --> 41:13.004
A gift from a friend.

41:13.038 --> 41:15.173
Can you help me
with this?

41:16.808 --> 41:19.110
(sighs) I've been
wondering something.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.112
What's that?

41:21.146 --> 41:23.214
All of this,

41:23.248 --> 41:25.684
why is it happening now?

41:25.717 --> 41:29.220
It's a good question.

41:29.254 --> 41:31.723
Let's go and find out.

41:31.757 --> 41:35.727
* Fill me
with that precious love *

41:35.761 --> 41:38.396
* There's a light in my life

41:38.429 --> 41:42.534
* Shining over me.

41:42.568 --> 41:44.169
MARCUS:
Let us begin.
