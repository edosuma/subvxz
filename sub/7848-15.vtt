10:04.500 --> 10:05.300
SHE'S A HYPOCRITE.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.867
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
SHE'S GOT A FOX COAT
IN HER CLOSET.

10:08.867 --> 10:10.834
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

10:10.834 --> 10:15.033

LISTEN TO THIS.
"ACCORDING TO

BURST INTO FLAMES
SPONTANEOUSLY.

11:01.300 --> 11:05.233

IS IT TRUE
YOU TORTURE ANIMALS?

11:05.233 --> 11:07.500
NO! NO,

ONE MORE QUESTION!

11:22.500 --> 11:25.767

11:28.967 --> 11:30.000
STEP AWAY
FROM THE HOTEL!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.800
I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE
WOULD SAY THIS ABOUT ME.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.700
BUT YOU SAID
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS BAD PUBLICITY,

11:34.700 --> 11:36.367
THAT IT MAKES
YOUR SOCIAL LIFE BETTER.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.500
YEAH, WHEN I'M
SPREADING IT.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.000
NOT WHEN OTHERS
ARE LYING ABOUT ME

11:40.000 --> 11:41.834

CUTE LITTLE ANIMALS.

11:41.834 --> 11:43.367
ALL MY FURS
ARE FAKE.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.567
BUT YOU SAID
THEY WERE FOX.

11:45.567 --> 11:49.867
YES. F-A-U-X. "FOX."

11:49.867 --> 11:52.000
THAT'S PRONOUNCED "FO."

11:52.000 --> 11:55.100
WHICH MIGHT'VE MADE
A DIFFERENCE TO--

11:55.100 --> 11:58.400
THE BIG MOUTH
WHO STARTED THIS RUMOR.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.200
MADDIE, YOU ARE TRULY

I WILL DO MY BEST

12:09.033 --> 12:10.834
TO FIND THE PERSON
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

12:10.834 --> 12:12.467
GOOD. AND WHEN
YOU FIND HIM,

12:12.467 --> 12:14.700
I WANT HIM THROWN
IN THE TIPTON
DUNGEON

12:14.700 --> 12:16.000
FOR THE REST

12:16.000 --> 12:18.133
