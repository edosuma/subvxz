00:17.351 --> 00:19.621
- What do you think, lindo?

00:19.654 --> 00:21.723
- Growl for the camera.
- Grrr.

00:21.756 --> 00:23.558
- Louder, lindo, louder.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.726
- Grrr.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.728
- Again, again!
- Grrr!

00:26.761 --> 00:28.763
- Howl, Will, howl!

00:31.298 --> 00:32.700
- Awoo!
- Awoo!

01:49.844 --> 01:51.311
- Pack a bag, lindo,
we're leaving.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.412
- But-
- Now.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.336
- Where's your cell phone?

02:17.204 --> 02:19.339
- Why?
- Lindo, cell phone.

02:20.808 --> 02:24.712
Oh my God,
you're in collusion with him.

02:24.746 --> 02:27.247
Ay...okay.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.617
Okay, okay.

02:29.651 --> 02:31.919
No, lindo, why?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.623
No...

02:35.657 --> 02:38.225
He'll never hurt me.
I know this.

02:38.258 --> 02:41.261
Of course I know this.
He'll never hurt me.

02:42.262 --> 02:43.598
Never hurt me.

02:50.237 --> 02:51.806
It's gonna be okay.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.417
It's gonna be okay.

03:07.689 --> 03:12.426
It's gonna be okay, lindo.
It's gonna be okay,

03:12.459 --> 03:14.862
It's gonna be okay, lindo.

03:14.896 --> 03:17.431
It's gonna be okay, lindo.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.333
It's all gonna be okay.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.376
Oh, lindo! Oh, lindo!

03:37.384 --> 03:40.420
Every tear

03:40.454 --> 03:44.559
Will be a memory

03:46.627 --> 03:53.735
Our future
is not ours to see

03:56.003 --> 04:00.775
Oh, wait and pray

04:00.808 --> 04:05.680
Each night for peace

04:09.416 --> 04:14.021
Tell me again

04:25.398 --> 04:28.503
I'm sorry for what happened
yesterday, lindo.

04:31.506 --> 04:35.743
I will prove to you how sorry,
and you will trust me again.

04:38.546 --> 04:41.015
I'll-I'll pick you up
after baseball practice.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.767
- Where is she, man?
- Yeah, where is she, man?

04:59.801 --> 05:02.837
- She's always fucking late.
- Always fucking late.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.337
- I can't wait to drive

05:04.371 --> 05:06.574
so I don't have to
fucking rely on anyone.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.810
- Fucking relying on others
is for pussies.

05:08.843 --> 05:09.977
- Why are you wearing
a turtleneck?

05:10.011 --> 05:11.779
It's like 85 degrees out.

05:11.813 --> 05:13.413
- Yeah, why are you wearing
a turtleneck?

05:13.446 --> 05:15.683
- Did your mom pick it out?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.417
- Yeah, faggot,
your mom pick it out?

05:17.450 --> 05:20.521
- Jesus, Tye.
- What?

05:20.555 --> 05:22.089
- Where's your mom, dude?

05:24.158 --> 05:26.493
- She's at the mental
hospital.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.531
- I'll call my mom.

05:40.842 --> 05:42.409
- Dad?

05:47.915 --> 05:49.416
Dad?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.429
- Don't go in the kitchen.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.065
I'll clean it up
in the morning.

06:56.751 --> 06:59.153
I'm feelin'
sexy and free

07:00.621 --> 07:03.057
Like glitter's
rainin' on me

07:04.125 --> 07:06.994
You're like a shot
of pure gold

07:08.129 --> 07:10.731
I think I'm 'bout to
explode

07:13.067 --> 07:14.568
I can taste the danger

07:14.602 --> 07:16.904
Like a cloud of smoke
in the air

07:16.938 --> 07:18.539
Now I'm breathing
like I'm running

07:18.572 --> 07:20.508
'Cause you're taking me
there

07:20.541 --> 07:22.009
Don't you know

07:23.277 --> 07:25.813
You spin me outta control

07:27.014 --> 07:29.617
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

07:29.650 --> 07:31.619
We can do this all night

07:31.652 --> 07:33.486
Damn,
this love is skin tight

07:33.521 --> 07:34.822
Baby, come on

07:34.855 --> 07:37.091
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

07:37.124 --> 07:38.993
Pull me like the bass drum

07:39.026 --> 07:40.995
Sparkin' up a rhythm

07:41.028 --> 07:42.730
Baby, come on

07:42.763 --> 07:44.497
Ooh ooh ooh

07:44.532 --> 07:47.802
Rock my world
into the sunlight

07:47.835 --> 07:51.872
Make this dream
the best I've ever known

07:51.906 --> 07:55.509
Dirty dancin'
in the moonlight

07:55.543 --> 07:59.213
Take me down
like I'm a domino

07:59.246 --> 08:02.984
Every second
is a highlight

08:03.017 --> 08:06.520
When we touch,
don't ever let me go

08:06.554 --> 08:10.725
Dirty dancin'
in the moonlight

08:10.758 --> 08:14.729
Take me down
like I'm a domino

08:21.135 --> 08:23.537
- What did she do?
What did she do?

08:23.571 --> 08:25.740
Sa-Sasha, talk to me.
Talk to me.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.575
Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.978
Breathe, breathe,
Sasha-Sasha,

08:31.012 --> 08:33.547
what color-what color
are your pants, huh?

08:33.581 --> 08:35.282
Sasha, look at-look at me.
Look, look at me.

08:35.316 --> 08:38.119
Sasha, can you name three
things in the room for me?

08:38.152 --> 08:40.087
Three objects.
Can you do that?

08:40.121 --> 08:41.255
- No.

08:47.028 --> 08:48.162
- Red.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.233
Red. What rhymes with red?

08:53.801 --> 08:55.136
- Dead.

08:55.169 --> 08:56.570
- Sure does.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.073
Okay, um... green.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.743
Come on, green.
- Mean.

09:02.777 --> 09:04.779
- Okay, your rhymes
are fucking negative.

09:06.047 --> 09:08.082
Blue, blue.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.683
- Fuck you.
- Oh!

09:09.717 --> 09:11.118
Now she's getting it.

09:11.152 --> 09:13.788
Hmm, her name is Sasha.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.157
She's here to say

09:16.190 --> 09:18.025
That her sign is a Libra

09:18.059 --> 09:19.827
and her job is-

09:19.860 --> 09:21.095
- Clay.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.098
My name is Sasha.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.634
I'm fierce if you're nasty.
- Hey, hey, nasty.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.636
- I talk real nice.
- Yes.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.304
- And I'm so classy.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.672
- Hey.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.910
Hey, way to get through
a panic attack.

09:37.111 --> 09:39.313
High five, yeah?
- Thanks.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.082
Thank you.

09:41.115 --> 09:43.184
- You're welcome. I'm really
glad that that worked,

09:43.217 --> 09:44.852
'cause otherwise I would have
tried to piss you off,

09:44.885 --> 09:46.620
and I really don't enjoy
being slammed.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.656
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
If-the next time

09:48.689 --> 09:51.158
you have a panic attack,
I...I got you.

09:51.192 --> 09:53.327
- Oh, I don't-I don't
get them anymore.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.197
- Please.
- Cured them all by myself,

09:56.230 --> 09:57.364
baby.

09:57.398 --> 09:58.766
- Lucky you.

10:00.201 --> 10:01.902
Fuck.

10:01.936 --> 10:03.037
- You all right?

10:05.005 --> 10:06.173
You go home.

10:06.207 --> 10:11.245
I'll fend off the basilisk
so you can sneak out the back.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.413
- Thanks, dude.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.647
- Yeah.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.951
Come here, you're all right.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.185
You're all right.

10:18.219 --> 10:19.687
- If you could pick up
a couple more things,

10:19.720 --> 10:21.055
I would love you forever.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.023
- Green juice and vitamin B12.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.059
- And pick up my dry cleaning?
- Got you, girl.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.894
Also the kiln door's
sticking again.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.229
I don't know
if you wanna call Juan

10:28.262 --> 10:30.397
and have him come take a look?
- Ugh, I would,

10:30.431 --> 10:32.166
but we just don't have it

10:32.199 --> 10:34.034
in the budget right now.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.371
Will?

10:38.939 --> 10:39.907
Will!

10:39.940 --> 10:41.642
- Hey, sorry. That was...

10:43.444 --> 10:46.447
Anyway, uh...

10:46.480 --> 10:50.117
copy that, okay.
Off to get you stuff.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.120
- I love you so much.
This kills me.

10:53.154 --> 10:55.956
If you were straight,
I would totally date you.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.793
Is that inappropriate to say?
Oh, well, if it is,

10:59.827 --> 11:02.429
you can take it up with
the head of HR, which is me.

11:12.006 --> 11:13.908
You're not naked.

11:14.842 --> 11:18.212
- Yeah, no naked cooking
till we dated for a year.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.247
- What do I get
for eight months?

11:23.017 --> 11:24.752
- Let's see.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.289
Baked brie
wrapped in a croissant...

11:28.322 --> 11:31.692
- Mm-hmm.
- With raspberry jam?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.461
Mmm!

11:34.495 --> 11:36.463
Yeah?

11:36.497 --> 11:38.365
I thought you'd be happy.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.208
- How was your day?

11:48.275 --> 11:49.710
- It was good.

11:50.211 --> 11:52.346
Yeah, I filled in
as a counselor.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.348
An 18-year-old tested
positive,

11:54.381 --> 11:55.883
so that was emotionally a lot,

11:55.916 --> 11:58.152
but I was glad
to be there for him.

12:04.526 --> 12:06.927
- Luke, the hero,
the kids desperately need,

12:06.961 --> 12:10.130
and, Will, the sellout,
making pottery for the rich.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.232
- Right, yeah, okay.

12:11.265 --> 12:14.802
Not a hero and not indulging
your insecurities today.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.237
- But I love
when you indulge them.

12:20.975 --> 12:24.878
- Hey, do you wanna have
brunch with my mom on Sunday?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.480
- Sure.

12:31.986 --> 12:34.054
What? What'd I do?

12:34.088 --> 12:35.789
I ate your last.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.091
Sorry, I was high.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.194
They're irresistible.
- No.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.363
It's just Sunday
is Mother's Day.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.898
- And?

12:44.932 --> 12:48.369
- And if my mom died...

12:48.402 --> 12:51.138
- Whoa ho ho ho.
Relax.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.307
My mom's been dead
most of my life.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.942
I'd love to meet your mother.

12:56.477 --> 12:57.845
- Okay.

14:23.397 --> 14:27.502
- Lindo,
my phone is misbehaving,

14:27.535 --> 14:29.103
so I'm sending this
to make sure

14:29.136 --> 14:32.507
you receive the message
and understand.

14:33.374 --> 14:35.242
One day you will learn
the intelligence

14:35.275 --> 14:37.010
that I am capable of.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.147
In the meantime,
these empty DVD boxes

14:40.180 --> 14:42.684
are no longer welcome
in my domain.

14:42.717 --> 14:45.653
Queen Mom. MMIXX7.

14:45.687 --> 14:49.323
P.S. Do not trust Luke.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.499
- Hey, Dr. Samson,

14:58.533 --> 14:59.933
you told me to call you

14:59.967 --> 15:02.236
if Mom ever tried
to contact me again.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.138
I know it's been ten years,

15:04.171 --> 15:06.440
but she finally
came out of the woodwork.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.908
I-I was wondering if-

15:16.751 --> 15:19.554
- Live free, love often,

15:19.587 --> 15:22.389
embrace wisdom.

15:28.663 --> 15:30.264
Sasha's grandmother's
in hospice,

15:30.297 --> 15:31.432
so she won't be here today.

15:31.465 --> 15:33.033
The shipment
should arrive in 15.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.935
I have a meeting
in Santa Monica.

17:02.456 --> 17:05.092
- Your hands okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.661
- Are you gonna
give me more than that?

17:06.694 --> 17:09.263
- It's sore. Didn't eat.

17:09.296 --> 17:12.734
- Oh, okay. Caveman Will.
Talk to me.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.670
- I'm stretching.

17:15.703 --> 17:17.772
- All right,
well, you have to eat

17:17.805 --> 17:19.807
more than one big meal
at the end of the day.

17:19.841 --> 17:22.242
- I'm fine.
I'm more than fine.

17:22.276 --> 17:23.611
I am amazing,

17:24.546 --> 17:26.781
fantastic, beautiful-
- Right, yes.

17:26.814 --> 17:28.850
- Sexy
- Et cetera.

17:28.883 --> 17:32.219
- Okay, hey, what did I tell
you about sneaking tastes?

17:32.787 --> 17:34.022
- I don't know.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.456
When you start telling me what
to do, I zone out, you know?

17:36.490 --> 17:37.592
- I know.
- Go to my happy place.

17:37.625 --> 17:38.860
- Yeah.
- You know, the one

17:38.893 --> 17:41.696
with Tom Hardy
naked on the chaise lounge?

17:43.765 --> 17:45.600
- All right, out, out,
out, out.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.301
You are no longer welcome
in my domain.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.135
Domain...domain...

17:48.168 --> 17:50.337
- My domain.
Do not trust-trust us.

17:52.507 --> 17:54.341
- Jesus.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.779
- Sorry, I've been
feeling dizzy lately.

17:57.812 --> 17:59.681
- For how long?
- It's nothing. Never mind.

17:59.714 --> 18:01.716
- How long, Will?
- Like a couple of days.

18:01.749 --> 18:03.350
- Well, you should
see a doctor.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.819
- That's absolutely
an overreaction.

18:04.852 --> 18:06.453
- Look in my eyes.
Let me-let me see them.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.655
- I'm fine. Stop fussing.

18:11.425 --> 18:12.727
- Okay, what the fuck
was that?

18:12.760 --> 18:14.194
- The ring was giving me
a headache.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.262
- Why are you lying?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.463
- Why are you
starting a fight?

18:16.496 --> 18:18.131
- What would you do if you
were in my position right now?

18:18.165 --> 18:19.534
- Mind my own business.

18:32.479 --> 18:36.149
- Will, it's 7:37 p.m.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.719
I'm not sure
how much time I have,

18:37.752 --> 18:41.823
but you are dating someone-
Luke.

18:41.856 --> 18:42.957
Don't ask me how I know.

18:42.991 --> 18:47.695
I know, but trust me, he's not
in your best interest.

18:47.729 --> 18:49.396
He is unkind.

18:50.732 --> 18:52.934
I raised you
to be independent, lindo.

18:52.967 --> 18:57.471
You must become
a private investigator.

18:57.505 --> 18:58.773
I want to talk to him.

18:58.806 --> 19:01.241
Please send me his email
and phone number.

19:39.013 --> 19:40.648
- How's the boy?

19:40.682 --> 19:42.984
- Oh, he's there.

19:43.017 --> 19:46.554
He's kind.
He's getting on my nerves.

19:46.587 --> 19:47.855
- Why?

19:47.889 --> 19:49.590
- Wants to know things
about me.

19:49.624 --> 19:52.794
- Real, like...
personal things?

19:52.827 --> 19:54.962
- Terrible, right?
- Dude, absolutely.

19:54.996 --> 19:58.733
Boys don't get to know me
for at least...six months.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.369
- It's been eight.
- Oh.

20:03.771 --> 20:05.673
Yeah, maybe
you're in the wrong here.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.341
- Oh my God, you guys!

20:08.375 --> 20:10.011
I'm so excited
the gallery's ready.

20:10.044 --> 20:11.612
The pieces look amazing.

20:11.646 --> 20:14.247
I know things have been rough
for you recently,

20:14.281 --> 20:16.818
but I am so excited
to celebrate us tonight.

20:16.851 --> 20:18.519
Be there at 6 p.m.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.629
- Oh, if you ever want to go
to my grandma's cabin,

20:28.663 --> 20:29.664
let me know.

20:29.697 --> 20:31.733
She has a hot tub,
and it usually gets the boys

20:31.766 --> 20:35.903
to forget about their problems
and shut the fuck up.

20:35.937 --> 20:37.939
- Oh, hell yeah.

20:37.972 --> 20:41.008
I'll definitely
take you up on that.

20:43.745 --> 20:46.413
- You okay?
- Yes.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.482
My finger locked up.
I should have stretched it.

21:12.974 --> 21:14.542
Will.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.786
Will?

21:26.721 --> 21:28.089
Will!

21:28.122 --> 21:29.489
Are you okay?

21:31.959 --> 21:33.628
- Ohh!

21:35.495 --> 21:37.397
- I ate today.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.933
- What?

21:38.966 --> 21:40.367
- I've been-I've been
feeling dizzy.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.536
I don't know why.

21:41.569 --> 21:44.105
- Okay, you need to go
to the doctor.

21:44.138 --> 21:46.007
Will!

21:47.708 --> 21:48.709
- F-

22:33.554 --> 22:36.157
- 'Sup, my dude?
I'm NP Chaz.

22:36.190 --> 22:39.392
What seems to be the problem?

22:39.426 --> 22:41.796
- Okay, so...

22:41.829 --> 22:45.800
I was lifting heavy stuff
at work the other week.

22:45.833 --> 22:48.002
I fell, and my arms-

22:48.035 --> 22:50.037
I-I landed on them
and-and ever since,

22:50.071 --> 22:52.940
there's been like a tingling
sensation and weakness

22:52.974 --> 22:55.442
and sometimes pain.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.844
- It sounds like neuropathy.

22:56.878 --> 22:59.947
Should go away
in a week or so. Is that it?

22:59.981 --> 23:03.084
- Yeah...
- Okay, cool.

23:03.117 --> 23:04.785
- Wait-fuck.

23:04.819 --> 23:07.989
Yeah, okay, um...

23:08.022 --> 23:14.862
I also...have started
getting these dizziness spells

23:14.896 --> 23:17.064
and nausea
and my brain is foggy

23:17.098 --> 23:19.600
and I feel like I can't think.
- Hmm.

23:19.634 --> 23:21.135
- I was doing some
Googling and-

23:21.168 --> 23:24.805
- Bro, never Google.

23:24.839 --> 23:27.642
- Okay.

23:27.675 --> 23:30.878
Anyway, the-
the Google symptoms

23:30.912 --> 23:32.780
said that they-they could be
connected to ALS or MS.

23:32.813 --> 23:36.183
- I want you to squeeze
my fingers hard as you can.

23:39.220 --> 23:42.723
Okay, good.
Now close your eyes.

23:45.826 --> 23:47.895
Does this feel the same?

23:47.929 --> 23:49.530
- Mm-hmm.

23:49.563 --> 23:50.932
- And what about this?

23:50.965 --> 23:52.499
No peeking.
- Sorry.

23:53.935 --> 23:55.136
- Does that feel the same?

23:55.169 --> 23:57.138
- I...ha, think so, yeah.

23:57.171 --> 24:00.574
- Okay, now open your eyes
and follow my fingers.

24:02.743 --> 24:04.178
Are you stressed?

24:04.211 --> 24:06.781
- I-I don't know.

24:06.814 --> 24:08.849
- Scale of one to ten?

24:08.883 --> 24:11.252
- I-I haven't been eating.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.220
- Okay, let's do
some blood work.

24:13.254 --> 24:15.790
My guess-stress.

24:15.823 --> 24:19.060
You'd be shocked at how
the mind can affect the body.

24:19.093 --> 24:21.829
Also, dude, you need to eat.

24:21.862 --> 24:23.931
- Okay.

24:23.965 --> 24:25.967
Step-step one, eat.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.702
Step two?

24:27.735 --> 24:29.070
- Rest. Ice.

24:29.103 --> 24:31.172
You're gonna feel better
in a week.

24:32.740 --> 24:34.175
- What-that's it?

24:34.208 --> 24:35.776
- I mean, unless
you're the one in 10,000

24:35.810 --> 24:38.212
with a neuromuscular disease.

24:39.246 --> 24:40.581
Is that it?

24:40.614 --> 24:43.617
- Yeah, yeah-yeah, that's it.

24:43.651 --> 24:46.554
- Cool. We'll call you
if something's wrong.

24:47.888 --> 24:49.790
But we're not gonna call you.

25:12.747 --> 25:16.117
- Dear Will, how are you?

25:16.150 --> 25:17.218
Two things.

25:17.251 --> 25:21.889
One, I have prepared a concept
of a play or a movie

25:21.922 --> 25:23.924
that I would like
your opinion of.

25:23.958 --> 25:26.160
I have included books
I have read

25:26.193 --> 25:31.298
in the last 30 years
of my life that meant a lot.

25:31.332 --> 25:34.101
This is who I am.

25:34.135 --> 25:39.106
Also, I am informing you
I have spoken with Luke.

25:39.140 --> 25:42.576
He has logic beyond dreams.

25:42.610 --> 25:45.046
Hope you're eating
five meals a day. Salud!

26:03.097 --> 26:05.266
- There are things in my life
that are coming out now

26:05.299 --> 26:10.237
that I thought I could ignore,
but I think...

26:12.106 --> 26:14.775
I think they're causing all
the shit that's going down.

26:14.809 --> 26:16.243
- Doesn't sound like
an apology.

26:16.277 --> 26:18.112
- I'm used to dealing
with this shit on my own.

26:18.145 --> 26:20.614
I want to tell you everything,
I-

26:22.383 --> 26:24.685
I wanna tell you everything.
I do. I just...

26:26.020 --> 26:27.321
I need some time.

26:32.259 --> 26:35.396
When I was 12, my mom
tried to kill me, and...

26:35.429 --> 26:37.731
that's when we found out
that she was sick.

26:49.243 --> 26:51.245
You're always gonna
look at me like that now.

26:51.278 --> 26:54.181
- What? I'm not looking
at you like anything.

26:54.215 --> 26:57.284
- You don't think you are,
but you are.

26:57.318 --> 27:00.754
- Okay...
look, no one is perfect.

27:00.788 --> 27:03.858
I mean, you're-you're 30.

27:03.891 --> 27:06.360
You drink too much.

27:06.393 --> 27:08.129
You have a-a weird laugh.

27:08.162 --> 27:10.865
- My laugh is amazing.
Excuse me?

27:10.898 --> 27:14.802
- I love you
because you're flawed.

27:14.835 --> 27:18.272
What? The way you yell
at the TV when you're drunk,

27:18.305 --> 27:21.942
how you do that little twirl
when you're lost in thought,

27:21.976 --> 27:23.277
even in public.

27:25.012 --> 27:26.313
You have to tell me
the bad stuff.

27:26.347 --> 27:28.015
We have to be able
to rely on each other.

27:28.048 --> 27:30.751
- Okay, you can
always rely on me.

27:30.784 --> 27:32.953
- Well, you have to be able
to rely on me too,

27:32.987 --> 27:34.688
or else it isn't
going to work.

27:38.893 --> 27:43.264
- I got the keys to Sasha's
cabin for the weekend to rest.

27:43.297 --> 27:45.199
Doctor's orders.
Maybe we can...

27:47.401 --> 27:50.838
Talk about our lives and
feelings and stuff more there.

27:52.173 --> 27:54.808
- What about brunch
with my mom?

27:54.842 --> 27:57.011
- Drive home early on Sunday
and meet her.

28:04.885 --> 28:06.887
I'll do all the dishes.

28:06.921 --> 28:10.090
- You will?
Okay, what about your arms?

28:10.124 --> 28:11.825
- Already
starting to feel better.

28:56.538 --> 28:58.839
- So are you feeling relaxed?

29:00.241 --> 29:01.976
- A bit anxious, actually.

29:02.009 --> 29:04.278
I could use a distraction.

29:06.146 --> 29:07.381
- So predictable.

29:09.450 --> 29:12.253
- What kinda distraction
did you think I meant?

29:12.286 --> 29:14.855
- Will?
- Luke, you dirty devil.

29:14.888 --> 29:18.292
Did you mean to think
that I had meant sex?

29:18.325 --> 29:20.361
I-I would never in
a million years insinuate

29:20.394 --> 29:22.363
that I wanna be distracted
with sexy time.

29:22.396 --> 29:24.064
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

29:24.098 --> 29:25.866
I need another drink.
- Dance with me.

29:25.899 --> 29:28.536
- What?
- Dance with me.

29:28.570 --> 29:30.437
Seduce me
with your smooth hips.

29:30.471 --> 29:33.073
Distract me from
my woes and troubles.

29:33.107 --> 29:34.108
- I'm not a good dancer.

29:34.141 --> 29:37.278
- You're like stupid good,
but you never dance.

29:37.311 --> 29:39.280
- What? I dance.

29:39.313 --> 29:42.149
Alone in my room
when no one is watching.

29:42.182 --> 29:43.984
- Okay,
then I'll start you off.

29:46.353 --> 29:48.022
If you don't dance with me,
I'm gonna have to do

29:48.055 --> 29:49.823
a striptease
to "Out Tonight" from "Rent,"

29:49.857 --> 29:52.393
and we all know
no one wants to see that.

29:52.426 --> 29:54.128
Except me. I wanna see that.

29:56.964 --> 29:58.899
Come on.
- Okay.

30:03.270 --> 30:05.272
- Excuse me, I'm leading.

30:08.208 --> 30:10.978
- There's no music.

30:11.011 --> 30:12.614
- What do you call
the crickets outside

30:12.647 --> 30:15.916
and the moon and the water
that I left running.

30:15.949 --> 30:20.854
Okay, also I can count us off,
and we'll do the waltz.

30:20.888 --> 30:22.156
Hey, I'm holding
your hand, bro.

30:22.189 --> 30:24.425
- My God. Oh, my God.

30:24.458 --> 30:26.960
- And, one, two, three,

30:26.994 --> 30:30.397
one, two, one, two.

30:30.431 --> 30:32.232
A-one, two. Come on.

30:32.266 --> 30:34.201
One, two, three, one, two.

30:34.234 --> 30:36.571
Ah, yes, bitch. There you go.
- Yeah, I'm doing it.

30:36.604 --> 30:38.472
- He is doing it.

30:38.506 --> 30:41.008
Badly, but you're doing-

30:41.041 --> 30:42.276
- Oh, my God.

30:42.309 --> 30:44.912
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

30:44.945 --> 30:46.246
One-

30:47.348 --> 30:49.049
- Hey.

30:53.588 --> 30:55.322
- I fucking love you.

30:56.457 --> 30:58.092
So much.

31:00.695 --> 31:02.530
- I love you too.

31:05.099 --> 31:06.233
- Good.

31:10.605 --> 31:13.374
Now kiss me
like you mean it, hot stuff.

31:30.457 --> 31:33.628
- No.
- Please?

31:33.661 --> 31:36.163
- No.
- Come on!

31:36.196 --> 31:38.165
- Where-where
did you get these?

31:38.198 --> 31:40.000
- Sasha.

31:41.703 --> 31:43.470
- The purpose of this trip-

31:43.505 --> 31:44.506
- I know, and we will.

31:44.539 --> 31:46.273
I just wanna relax
and hallucinate a little bit

31:46.306 --> 31:48.108
before I get
into my emotional trauma.

32:00.187 --> 32:01.422
Oh, wow.

32:06.994 --> 32:08.730
Oh, wow.

32:08.763 --> 32:11.498
Oh, wow. Hey.

32:11.533 --> 32:13.267
Luke?

32:15.737 --> 32:20.941
Luke, you gotta lay
on this bearskin rug.

32:23.277 --> 32:24.679
It's breathing.

32:25.780 --> 32:28.348
- The chair is fine with me.

32:28.382 --> 32:29.617
Thanks.

32:32.319 --> 32:34.188
- I gotta be outside.

32:59.514 --> 33:02.584
- Will, my dude.
It's Chaz, how you doing?

33:02.617 --> 33:04.084
- Fine.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.655
- Cool. Yeah, cool.

33:07.689 --> 33:10.224
Well, we got
your blood results.

33:11.726 --> 33:13.327
- Yeah, are they-they okay?

33:13.360 --> 33:16.063
- Yeah, you have
a pretty serious

33:16.096 --> 33:18.031
vitamin D deficiency.

33:18.065 --> 33:19.466
- Oh-oh.

33:19.500 --> 33:24.037
- I'm gonna write you a script
for some vitamin D, kay?

33:24.071 --> 33:26.039
Be well.

33:29.777 --> 33:31.445
- We'll call you
if something's wrong,

33:31.478 --> 33:33.247
something's wrong,
something's wrong,

33:33.280 --> 33:34.716
something's wrong.

33:36.183 --> 33:37.384
But we're not gonna call you.

33:37.417 --> 33:39.052
- I need you to be
independent, lindo-

33:40.722 --> 33:42.422
- Unless you're the one
in 10,000

33:42.456 --> 33:44.224
with a neuromuscular disease.

33:46.093 --> 33:48.530
Become a private investigator.

33:50.397 --> 33:52.667
I raised you to be
independent, lindo.

33:52.700 --> 33:55.068
Raised you to be independent.
Raised you to be independent.

33:55.102 --> 33:57.237
- If you're the one in...
if you're the one in...

33:57.271 --> 33:59.206
if you're the one in 10,000...

34:04.177 --> 34:06.179
- There's something
really wrong with me.

34:24.766 --> 34:27.569
Are there wolves
in these woods?

34:27.602 --> 34:30.470
- What? What, hey?

34:30.505 --> 34:32.472
- Are there wolves
in these woods?

34:32.507 --> 34:35.275
- Hey, hey, it's okay.
Hey, shh, shh.

34:35.309 --> 34:37.477
Breathe.
Breathe with me, okay?

34:37.512 --> 34:38.412
Breathe.

34:40.582 --> 34:41.849
Yeah. Again.

34:46.253 --> 34:47.622
- Good, good.

34:47.655 --> 34:50.625
There are no wolves,
all right?

34:50.658 --> 34:52.192
It's the shrooms.

34:53.226 --> 34:56.096
You thought the bearskin
was breathing, remember?

34:59.734 --> 35:01.501
What do you need?

35:05.172 --> 35:07.508
- Can we postpone
our session trauma thingy?

35:07.542 --> 35:08.676
I'm-

35:10.678 --> 35:12.880
It's giving me a lot of
anxiety, and I...

35:14.682 --> 35:17.652
I don't know if I'm in
the right mindset to...

35:24.358 --> 35:26.828
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

36:10.705 --> 36:12.707
Will.

36:14.909 --> 36:16.376
Will.

36:21.949 --> 36:23.885
Help me.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.537
I'm stuck.

36:56.984 --> 36:59.252
Aah!

37:25.079 --> 37:28.983
- Your arms okay?
- They hurt.

37:30.918 --> 37:33.487
- I take it that means
you're skipping brunch.

37:38.025 --> 37:39.527
Great.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.829
- I didn't do this on purpose.
- No, you did.

37:41.863 --> 37:43.965
And I was stupid enough
not to realize what you did.

37:43.998 --> 37:44.999
- I don't wanna fight.
I'm in pain.

37:45.032 --> 37:46.734
- I'm not fighting.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.076
We're still learning things
about each other,

37:55.109 --> 37:57.812
and today I learned
how manipulative you can be.

37:57.845 --> 37:59.714
- Whoa.

37:59.747 --> 38:03.985
- You will do anything to get
out of talking about yourself.

38:04.018 --> 38:05.686
The dancing was a nice touch.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.522
- Uh...I-I-

38:07.555 --> 38:08.956
- It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

38:08.990 --> 38:10.357
Lesson learned.

38:11.793 --> 38:13.027
- Has anything
particularly stressful

38:13.060 --> 38:14.629
been happening in your life?

38:16.063 --> 38:17.330
- Yes.
- Yeah.

38:18.398 --> 38:20.735
Okay, take your shirt off
and I'll be right back.

39:05.646 --> 39:07.548
Too cold to keep
your shirt off?

39:09.016 --> 39:10.551
- I was going to pee.

39:10.585 --> 39:12.520
- Okay, hold off on that.
Have a seat.

39:15.690 --> 39:17.424
Take your shirt off.

39:22.597 --> 39:24.599
Okay, breathe normal.
You're breathing shallow.

39:24.632 --> 39:26.499
Breathe in deep.

39:29.704 --> 39:30.938
One more time.

39:33.107 --> 39:34.575
Do you feel anything?

39:34.609 --> 39:36.010
Any pain here?
- No.

39:36.043 --> 39:37.410
- What about here?

39:37.444 --> 39:38.478
- No.

39:38.512 --> 39:40.147
- What about here?
- No.

39:40.181 --> 39:41.916
- Put your shirt back on.

39:50.024 --> 39:51.993
I think it's just stress.

39:53.828 --> 39:55.963
- Are-are you sure?

39:55.997 --> 39:59.634
- You would be shocked at how
the mind can affect the body.

40:00.968 --> 40:02.503
All right,
but just to be safe,

40:02.536 --> 40:04.005
why don't I order you up
some creatine kinase,

40:04.038 --> 40:06.540
erythrocyte sedimentation rate
and C-reactive protein test.

40:06.574 --> 40:08.576
Just so we can rule out ALS

40:08.609 --> 40:10.011
or any kind of
neuromuscular disorder.

40:10.044 --> 40:11.746
How does that sound?

40:11.779 --> 40:13.147
- I really appreciate that.

40:15.082 --> 40:17.618
- Just down the hall,
the red door on your right.

40:20.221 --> 40:22.723
Oh, Will? No more Googling.

40:27.228 --> 40:28.562
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:28.596 --> 40:30.531
- A week?

40:37.004 --> 40:38.973
- That's what the doctor said.

40:40.574 --> 40:42.043
- Look, Will, I like you.

40:42.076 --> 40:45.012
I chose you out of
a hundred other applications

40:45.046 --> 40:46.547
for this job.

40:47.648 --> 40:53.486
The sad reality is if
you have to take a week off,

40:53.521 --> 40:55.222
I would have to replace you.

40:56.223 --> 40:58.693
- That's not fair.

40:58.726 --> 41:01.494
- I'm not in the business
of being fair.

41:01.529 --> 41:04.065
I'm in the business
of high-end pottery.

41:22.984 --> 41:26.921
- Hello, Will.
This is your mother.

41:27.788 --> 41:30.490
I just have one question
for you-just one.

41:31.659 --> 41:33.861
Do you think
your mother's an idiot?

41:33.894 --> 41:37.865
You think your mother's
an idiot.

41:37.898 --> 41:41.602
I'm not the idiot.
You're the idiot.

41:41.635 --> 41:44.705
Idiot. Idiota!

41:52.713 --> 41:53.981
- Hello?

42:17.938 --> 42:19.673
Hello?

43:04.118 --> 43:05.886
I'm stuck.

43:19.166 --> 43:21.368
I can't breathe.

43:26.674 --> 43:29.110
Help me.

43:34.115 --> 43:35.349
I can't breathe.

43:35.382 --> 43:37.084
I can't breathe.

43:41.956 --> 43:44.291
I can't breathe.

43:44.325 --> 43:46.861
I can't breathe,
I can't breathe!

44:03.944 --> 44:06.213
I can't breathe! Help!

44:12.853 --> 44:14.722
Aah!

44:18.759 --> 44:20.961
- Why would you touch
the kiln?

44:20.995 --> 44:23.864
Call an ambulance!
I could be liable if-

44:23.898 --> 44:24.932
Are you serious?!

44:26.267 --> 44:27.334
Fuck you, boss!
- Ohh-

44:43.450 --> 44:45.085
- So what's going on?

44:53.194 --> 44:54.828
Is it your mom?

45:06.807 --> 45:09.276
- You shouldn't trust
anything she says.

45:11.011 --> 45:12.880
- I know. I know, it was-

45:12.913 --> 45:14.915
that was pretty obvious
from her emails.

45:19.853 --> 45:22.122
I get why you didn't tell me
that she's alive.

45:23.525 --> 45:25.192
When my sister Oded,
I didn't wanna

45:25.226 --> 45:27.094
tell anybody either.
- It's not the same thing.

45:27.127 --> 45:28.796
- I know.
- Good.

45:29.797 --> 45:32.166
Good. 'Cause it isn't.

45:32.199 --> 45:33.901
- Why won't you trust me?

45:33.934 --> 45:36.203
I'm sitting here
right now with you.

45:36.237 --> 45:37.838
Let me help you.

45:40.474 --> 45:43.545
- Why didn't you tell me that
you were talking to my mom?

45:43.578 --> 45:45.446
- Because she literally
just emailed me.

45:45.479 --> 45:47.314
- I think we should break up.

45:54.088 --> 45:57.057
I'm at the edge of something
that I can't turn back from,

45:57.091 --> 45:59.059
and it's safer for you...

46:00.227 --> 46:02.029
If you stay away.

46:04.465 --> 46:06.333
You already look at me
differently and...

46:08.435 --> 46:10.838
And I'm getting worse.

46:14.441 --> 46:16.443
And if we keep going...

46:18.045 --> 46:20.247
I'll destroy you.

46:25.919 --> 46:27.288
- Such a martyr.
- A I'm not gonna

46:27.321 --> 46:29.290
let that happen.

46:30.891 --> 46:32.560
- Oh, man.

46:35.530 --> 46:37.398
- You're gonna be okay.

46:45.139 --> 46:46.508
Luke...

46:49.376 --> 46:50.978
You're gonna be okay.

47:29.283 --> 47:32.386
- I need to see
a psychiatrist now.

47:32.419 --> 47:34.888
- I don't know
any psychiatrists.

47:34.922 --> 47:37.257
- Mom's? Can you call?

47:37.291 --> 47:40.961
- Can't do that yourself, huh?
- Can you just do it?

47:42.029 --> 47:43.997
- I've got a dinner thing
tonight in the city.

47:44.031 --> 47:45.366
- With who?

47:46.433 --> 47:48.369
- You could order Chinese.

47:56.443 --> 47:59.146
- We're a couple of sad sacks,
right, Faulkner?

48:09.591 --> 48:13.193
- Lindo, I'm in Puerto Rico.
Where, I will not say.

48:13.227 --> 48:14.361
I will not be returning home

48:14.395 --> 48:16.163
until I prove
it is safe for me.

48:16.196 --> 48:18.666
I cannot say much more,
but it is extra important

48:18.700 --> 48:20.702
that my identity is protected.

48:20.735 --> 48:24.304
Imposters are everywhere,
Lindo, everywhere.

48:24.338 --> 48:27.307
I am letting you know
there are items in my study

48:27.341 --> 48:28.510
that will change your world,

48:28.543 --> 48:29.977
but I don't think
you're ready.

48:30.010 --> 48:32.279
Also, remember our trip
to Adesivo?

48:32.312 --> 48:33.648
I found a picture of you
naked...

48:33.681 --> 48:36.150
...Aunty Bertha's house.

48:36.183 --> 48:38.218
She's not doing so good.

48:38.252 --> 48:39.486
- Fuck.

49:23.565 --> 49:26.166
I'm having a panic attack.

49:26.200 --> 49:28.770
- Okay.

49:28.803 --> 49:32.406
- I can't breathe, and I
need help...understand?

49:33.173 --> 49:34.709
- Okay.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.549
You don't feel panic ever?

49:41.583 --> 49:43.150
- No.

49:44.619 --> 49:48.021
Mm. Hey, Faulkner.

49:49.122 --> 49:51.225
Would you help Will
with his...

49:51.258 --> 49:52.426
panic whatever?

50:01.201 --> 50:04.471
What should I watch on TV?

50:04.506 --> 50:07.040
Should I watch the news?

50:07.074 --> 50:08.208
- Dad.

50:08.242 --> 50:09.243
- All right,
I'll watch the news.

50:09.276 --> 50:10.277
- Please, Dad.

50:10.310 --> 50:12.379
- Can't imagine there'll be
anything good on.

50:12.412 --> 50:15.550
- Please, Dad, please help me.
- Oh, here we go.

50:15.583 --> 50:18.820
Another woman comes forward
against that congressman.

50:18.853 --> 50:20.487
So silly.

50:20.522 --> 50:21.723
- Silly?

50:21.756 --> 50:23.357
- Yeah, sure.

50:23.390 --> 50:25.492
A woman gets raped and doesn't
report it right away?

50:25.527 --> 50:26.628
She should just remain silent.

50:26.661 --> 50:28.161
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

50:28.195 --> 50:29.496
- I don't even know
what to say to that.

50:29.531 --> 50:30.632
- You're not a lawyer.
- The woman who came out

50:30.665 --> 50:33.668
against that tech CEO is still
getting death threats.

50:33.701 --> 50:35.637
- It was clear
from the testimony

50:35.670 --> 50:37.437
that there was never
any intention to rape.

50:37.471 --> 50:39.406
- Did you do that kind
of stuff when you were a kid?

50:39.439 --> 50:40.708
- No, I was on the swim team.

50:40.742 --> 50:42.777
- The Stanford kid
was on the swim team.

50:42.810 --> 50:44.546
- You don't seem
injured to me.

50:44.579 --> 50:46.146
- What are you talking about?

50:46.179 --> 50:47.782
- You're gesticulating wildly.

50:50.117 --> 50:52.486
I guess the best way to get
you out of a panic attack

50:52.520 --> 50:54.354
is to piss you off.

51:02.229 --> 51:04.532
- What happened to your arms?

51:07.869 --> 51:09.537
- I got injured at work.

51:11.839 --> 51:14.676
And, yes, I am in a severe
amount of pain right now.

51:14.709 --> 51:16.176
Thanks for asking.

51:18.278 --> 51:19.446
Ha.

51:21.248 --> 51:24.217
Definitely could use
a trim right now,

51:24.251 --> 51:28.255
but, uh, it's too painful
to hold a razor, so...

51:30.290 --> 51:32.092
- Why don't you ask your dad
to help you?

51:34.361 --> 51:36.496
- Huh?

51:36.531 --> 51:38.666
- Why don't you ask
your dad to help?

51:40.935 --> 51:44.104
He's not gonna shave me.
It's too homoerotic.

51:45.472 --> 51:46.774
He also doesn't think

51:46.808 --> 51:49.744
what's happening to me
right now is real, which-

51:53.915 --> 51:56.116
Ha ha. Um...

51:57.585 --> 51:59.654
I've seen two doctors,

51:59.687 --> 52:02.890
and both blood tests
have come back fine.

52:03.825 --> 52:06.460
They say it's tendonitis.

52:08.228 --> 52:09.564
But I keep thinking,

52:09.597 --> 52:12.900
"What about the head fog
and the dizziness?"

52:14.267 --> 52:15.369
And they say,

52:15.402 --> 52:18.606
"You'd be surprised how
the mind can affect the body."

52:22.677 --> 52:25.880
- That is true.
You would be surprised.

52:26.881 --> 52:30.384
- Fine, fine.
Then order an MRI.

52:30.417 --> 52:31.886
Make sure.

52:31.919 --> 52:32.854
- Do you think
that would help?

52:32.887 --> 52:34.522
- Yes, I do!

52:36.557 --> 52:40.828
I don't care if I have ALS
or MS or whatever.

52:40.862 --> 52:42.664
I-I just want it to stop.

52:50.805 --> 52:57.244
I need to know...
if it isn't real.

52:59.881 --> 53:01.949
And if it isn't...

53:13.961 --> 53:15.596
I'm seeing a wolf.

53:19.834 --> 53:23.370
If I'm finally following
in her footsteps,

53:23.403 --> 53:25.740
I'm gonna kill myself.

53:25.773 --> 53:27.875
She has no one.

53:27.909 --> 53:29.610
Everybody who's ever loved her

53:29.644 --> 53:31.913
she's damaged beyond repair.

53:33.781 --> 53:35.783
I'm not gonna hurt people
like that.

53:37.317 --> 53:40.688
I'm not gonna hurt people
like she hurt people.

53:44.424 --> 53:47.227
I'm not gonna do it. I won't.

53:50.865 --> 53:52.533
- Why a wolf?

53:52.567 --> 53:54.334
- Hmm?

53:54.367 --> 53:57.739
- You said you were
seeing a wolf. Why a wolf?

54:01.509 --> 54:03.611
- I...

54:05.713 --> 54:07.615
I have no fucking clue.

54:31.471 --> 54:32.874
Antipsychotics.?

54:34.008 --> 54:35.743
- Antipsychotics..

54:45.052 --> 54:46.587
- Good.

54:51.859 --> 54:54.829
I'm not gonna...kill myself.

54:55.963 --> 54:57.598
- I know.

54:59.867 --> 55:01.636
Do you remember
what I said to you

55:01.669 --> 55:03.971
right before you left
for college?

55:06.507 --> 55:08.976
- You told me to run.

55:11.012 --> 55:14.549
To run and not look back.

55:17.618 --> 55:21.055
- And here you are...
- back again.

55:31.098 --> 55:33.601
- I can't,
not with all the meds.

55:35.402 --> 55:38.371
- Hmm.
- Fuck.

55:40.407 --> 55:42.143
- What's wrong?

55:42.176 --> 55:44.512
- Arms.

55:44.545 --> 55:46.914
- What, do you need me
to cut your food?

55:51.886 --> 55:53.721
That didn't hurt, did it?

56:04.799 --> 56:07.702
- You remember anything
about a wolf when I was a kid?

56:09.837 --> 56:12.506
- Just that you were a wolf
for Halloween every year

56:12.540 --> 56:13.975
in elementary school.

56:14.008 --> 56:16.644
- What?
- What?

56:18.813 --> 56:20.514
- I don't remember that.

56:20.548 --> 56:22.083
- Okay.

56:31.626 --> 56:33.661
- You still have the costume?

56:33.694 --> 56:35.830
- No, your mother probably
does.

56:39.466 --> 56:41.401
- Anything else?

56:44.906 --> 56:48.709
- Well, there was one year
when she was supposed

56:48.743 --> 56:52.213
to take you trick
or treating and, instead,

56:52.246 --> 56:55.482
she tried to
break into my law firm

56:55.516 --> 56:58.052
to prove I was CIA.

57:04.025 --> 57:06.527
- I'm going to the house
tomorrow.

57:08.129 --> 57:09.597
Everything started there.

57:09.630 --> 57:12.465
If I go there,
I think everything will end.

57:12.499 --> 57:16.070
- I think everything will end
if you keep taking your meds.

57:18.673 --> 57:20.808
- What if things don't stop?

57:22.043 --> 57:25.579
- Well, then you really are
turning into your mother,

57:25.613 --> 57:29.482
and I'll have to put you
in a mental hospital.

57:49.603 --> 57:54.275
- Hello, Will,
I've been trying to reach you.

57:54.308 --> 57:57.078
I'm in Puerto Rico.
Did-did-did you know that?

58:07.822 --> 58:10.758
I'm not doing so good, Will.

58:10.791 --> 58:15.730
I found out that my mom

58:15.763 --> 58:17.865
is not my mom.

58:19.600 --> 58:21.902
She's an imposter.

58:23.571 --> 58:26.640
Is your dad an imposter?

58:26.674 --> 58:30.711
I know.
I know you're not an imposter.

58:30.745 --> 58:36.017
You are a good boy.
You are good.

58:37.618 --> 58:41.155
Are you okay?
Do you need money?

58:41.188 --> 58:45.192
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

58:45.226 --> 58:48.562
Your mother's doing fine.

58:48.596 --> 58:50.998
Everything is fine.

1:00:30.064 --> 1:00:31.866
Ah-

1:03:30.878 --> 1:03:33.147
What do you think, lindo?

1:03:33.180 --> 1:03:34.348
Growl for the camera.

1:03:34.381 --> 1:03:36.950
- Grrr.
- Louder, Lingo, louder.

1:03:36.984 --> 1:03:38.986
- Grrr!
- Again, again!

1:03:39.019 --> 1:03:41.556
- Grrr!
- Howl, Will, howl!

1:04:08.683 --> 1:04:12.486
I'm warning you,
you enter my domain again,

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:14.955
and you shall be sorry.

1:04:14.988 --> 1:04:17.525
I am queen. It is my domain,

1:04:17.559 --> 1:04:21.462
and I shall be very unkind
to you if you enter it again.

1:04:29.937 --> 1:04:32.574
- I threw up again.

1:04:32.607 --> 1:04:35.677
- Hi, okay,
well, what do you need?

1:04:35.710 --> 1:04:38.145
You want a grilled cheese?

1:04:38.178 --> 1:04:40.481
Ginger ale.
- Okay.

1:04:40.515 --> 1:04:42.517
- Mom's gonna get you
a ginger ale.

1:04:42.550 --> 1:04:46.954
You planted a bomb?
And before you say anything,

1:04:46.987 --> 1:04:50.424
I ask you this-
do you care if I die?

1:04:50.457 --> 1:04:53.060
Do you care if your wife,

1:04:53.093 --> 1:04:56.598
your esposa, dies?

1:05:32.466 --> 1:05:34.435
Dinner's ready!

1:05:52.754 --> 1:05:55.322
No. No.

1:05:55.355 --> 1:05:57.324
- What the hell?

1:05:57.357 --> 1:06:00.160
- What did I tell you
about sneaking tastes?

1:06:00.194 --> 1:06:02.196
- I'm sorry, I-I-

1:06:04.198 --> 1:06:07.334
I need you
to take your medicine.

1:06:07.367 --> 1:06:10.037
If you don't, I-I will
no longer be your son,

1:06:10.070 --> 1:06:12.139
and I will never talk
to you again.

1:06:13.575 --> 1:06:15.309
Please.

1:06:21.248 --> 1:06:22.983
- Okay, lindo.

1:06:28.556 --> 1:06:31.492
- It's time to go.
- This is my domain.

1:06:31.526 --> 1:06:35.229
I will not be removed
from my domain.

1:06:35.262 --> 1:06:37.431
I thought I made myself clear.

1:06:37.464 --> 1:06:39.701
No, you won't!

1:06:39.734 --> 1:06:43.505
Aah! No!

1:06:43.538 --> 1:06:50.277
No, no, no, no, no, no-

1:09:48.790 --> 1:09:50.892
- MRI came back clear.

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:53.961
- Okay.

1:09:55.029 --> 1:09:57.364
- That's good news, Will.
We've done all the tests.

1:09:57.397 --> 1:09:59.667
You're healthy.
It's what you wanted.

1:10:01.903 --> 1:10:03.871
- What if my symptoms
continue?

1:10:04.806 --> 1:10:07.508
- Then it might be time
to see a psychiatrist.

1:10:07.542 --> 1:10:09.777
You'd be surprised-
- I did see a psychiatrist.

1:10:09.811 --> 1:10:12.647
I'm on Antipsychotics..

1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:14.281
- For how long?

1:10:14.314 --> 1:10:16.316
- Three days.

1:10:16.349 --> 1:10:18.586
- It takes longer than that
to take full effect.

1:10:18.619 --> 1:10:21.022
Weeks, sometimes months.

1:10:21.055 --> 1:10:23.256
- What about my arms?

1:10:23.290 --> 1:10:25.626
- I'm referring you
to a physical therapist,

1:10:25.660 --> 1:10:28.596
but don't start yet,
not until the pain is gone.

1:10:28.629 --> 1:10:31.999
If you don't wait
and keep using your arms,

1:10:32.033 --> 1:10:34.836
we may need
to consider surgery.

1:10:34.869 --> 1:10:37.337
Do you have someone
you can rely on until then?

1:10:37.370 --> 1:10:39.339
Someone willing
to take care of you?

1:10:52.452 --> 1:10:53.721
- Hey.

1:11:38.833 --> 1:11:40.001
Hey.

1:11:42.737 --> 1:11:44.337
Hey, it's okay.

1:11:45.940 --> 1:11:47.909
- I'm so fucked, Luke.

1:11:49.043 --> 1:11:50.077
- No.

1:11:54.849 --> 1:11:56.416
- I didn't know
what else to do.

1:11:56.449 --> 1:11:58.385
- I know.
- You're the only-

1:11:58.418 --> 1:12:01.656
only person who actually
cares about me.

1:12:04.759 --> 1:12:07.394
I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.

1:12:07.427 --> 1:12:10.330
- I'm such a fucking idiot.

1:12:10.932 --> 1:12:13.968
- Hey, hey.

1:12:14.001 --> 1:12:16.971
- Such a stupid fucking idiot.

1:12:17.004 --> 1:12:20.440
- No.
- Such a stupid fucking idiot.

1:12:20.473 --> 1:12:23.044
- No.
- I'm a fuck-stupid fuck-

1:12:23.077 --> 1:12:24.779
- Hey.

1:12:40.027 --> 1:12:42.897
- I don't deserve you,
I don't deserve you.

1:12:43.731 --> 1:12:45.099
- Shh.

1:12:50.171 --> 1:12:52.607
- You're so good to me.

1:12:58.546 --> 1:13:00.413
You're so good.

1:13:24.972 --> 1:13:27.440
- Come here.
- Oh...

1:14:07.748 --> 1:14:08.983
Fuck me.

1:14:10.618 --> 1:14:12.653
Fuck me.

1:14:12.687 --> 1:14:13.788
- Yes.

1:14:30.905 --> 1:14:32.239
- Oh, fuck.

1:14:59.033 --> 1:15:00.101
- Stop.

1:15:01.836 --> 1:15:03.204
That hurts.

1:15:06.073 --> 1:15:07.641
That hurts.

1:15:09.143 --> 1:15:11.612
You're hurting me. Stop-

1:15:15.116 --> 1:15:16.550
Look at me.

1:15:16.584 --> 1:15:18.285
- Stop. Stop.

1:15:18.319 --> 1:15:19.854
Stop.

1:15:21.322 --> 1:15:23.758
Look at me.

1:15:23.791 --> 1:15:27.028
- Okay, it's me.
Look at me, look at me.

1:15:27.061 --> 1:15:30.064
Hey, it's-it's me.
It's okay, breathe, breathe.

1:15:30.097 --> 1:15:31.899
Breathe with me,
breathe, all right.

1:15:31.932 --> 1:15:33.034
In...

1:15:34.335 --> 1:15:35.703
Out...

1:15:37.972 --> 1:15:39.040
In...

1:15:40.341 --> 1:15:42.109
Out.

1:15:43.944 --> 1:15:47.982
- Yeah, good, good.

1:15:48.015 --> 1:15:50.151
You're okay, you're okay.

1:16:08.803 --> 1:16:11.338
Every tear

1:16:11.372 --> 1:16:14.141
Will be a memory

1:16:17.344 --> 1:16:20.214
- The future is
mom: The future is

1:16:20.247 --> 1:16:24.885
Not ours to see

1:16:24.919 --> 1:16:28.923
So wait and pray

1:16:28.956 --> 1:16:33.227
Each night for me

1:16:34.862 --> 1:16:39.967
Till we meet again

1:16:41.235 --> 1:16:42.603
- That song.

1:16:44.238 --> 1:16:45.272
- What?

1:16:48.843 --> 1:16:51.679
- That...song.

1:16:54.915 --> 1:16:59.086
Why were you singing
that song?

1:17:00.187 --> 1:17:03.324
- Why? Will, hey.

1:17:03.357 --> 1:17:05.326
- Why were you singing that?

1:17:05.359 --> 1:17:07.094
Why?

1:17:07.128 --> 1:17:11.632
Why were you singing
that song?

1:17:18.239 --> 1:17:19.306
- Hey, hey!

1:17:20.441 --> 1:17:23.144
Will...Will, it's okay.

1:17:23.177 --> 1:17:25.112
- You're in collusion
with her, aren't you?

1:17:25.146 --> 1:17:27.148
- What did I tell you
about sneaking tastes?

1:17:27.181 --> 1:17:28.983
You are no
longer welcome in my domain.

1:17:32.052 --> 1:17:33.721
- Oh my God.

1:17:36.223 --> 1:17:39.293
Luke, why? Why?

1:17:39.326 --> 1:17:41.328
No...no...Luke!

1:17:42.997 --> 1:17:44.298
Stay back.
- You'll be okay.

1:17:44.331 --> 1:17:45.799
- Stay back!
- Will-

1:17:51.238 --> 1:17:54.775
- You're gonna be alone
for the rest of your life.

1:17:54.808 --> 1:17:56.844
Just like your mother.

1:18:04.752 --> 1:18:06.086
- Stop.

1:18:08.222 --> 1:18:10.824
Fucking idiot.

1:18:10.858 --> 1:18:15.196
Oh my God, you fucking idiot.

1:18:15.229 --> 1:18:17.865
You crazy fucking idiot!

1:18:18.132 --> 1:18:20.201
You're a crazy fucking idiot!

1:18:20.234 --> 1:18:21.702
Aah!

1:18:24.506 --> 1:18:25.607
- Well, then you're turning
into your mother,

1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:28.242
and I'll have to put you
in a mental hospital...ital...

1:19:14.822 --> 1:19:16.790
- Luke.

1:19:44.218 --> 1:19:46.954
- You break into my house.
I break into yours.

1:19:49.857 --> 1:19:51.425
Join me, lindo.

1:19:53.628 --> 1:19:56.163
I made coffee
from Puerto Rico.

1:19:57.931 --> 1:20:00.067
- I don't want to.

1:20:00.100 --> 1:20:02.069
- Obey your mother.

1:20:18.553 --> 1:20:21.922
Drink, please.

1:20:38.372 --> 1:20:40.107
Good?

1:20:45.913 --> 1:20:49.551
Are you all right, lindo?
You look unwell.

1:20:50.518 --> 1:20:53.020
- You know I'm not.

1:20:53.053 --> 1:20:56.524
- Yes, that's why I came,

1:20:56.558 --> 1:20:59.927
to take care of you
until the end.

1:21:04.365 --> 1:21:05.533
- What?

1:21:05.567 --> 1:21:07.669
- It's all right,
it's all right, lindo.

1:21:07.702 --> 1:21:09.537
- What do you mean?

1:21:09.571 --> 1:21:12.339
- We had you tested
when you were a child.

1:21:12.373 --> 1:21:17.545
I wanted to tell you, but your
dad, he told me I couldn't.

1:21:17.579 --> 1:21:19.113
He's a bad man

1:21:19.146 --> 1:21:21.516
who doesn't know
how to take care of people.

1:21:21.549 --> 1:21:26.621
I should've never married him,
but then we had you,

1:21:26.654 --> 1:21:30.157
and I wouldn't trade you
for the world.

1:21:30.190 --> 1:21:31.925
Sure, I had to give up
my career.

1:21:31.959 --> 1:21:37.331
I was inventor level, but no,
I don't blame you, lindo.

1:21:39.967 --> 1:21:42.102
It's okay.

1:21:44.004 --> 1:21:45.640
- Shh.

1:21:48.108 --> 1:21:50.444
- I'm scared, Mom.

1:21:50.477 --> 1:21:53.681
- I know, I know.

1:21:54.582 --> 1:21:56.483
Shh, shh, shh.

1:21:56.518 --> 1:21:59.153
No, no, no.

1:21:59.186 --> 1:22:01.689
No, no, you're all right. Shh.

1:22:01.723 --> 1:22:05.025
It's okay. I know.

1:22:05.058 --> 1:22:06.528
- You wouldn't hurt me.

1:22:06.561 --> 1:22:07.995
- No.

1:22:08.028 --> 1:22:09.496
- I know this.

1:22:10.665 --> 1:22:13.601
Of course, I know this.

1:22:13.635 --> 1:22:14.702
- Never.

1:22:16.136 --> 1:22:17.171
Never.

1:22:17.204 --> 1:22:19.139
It's gonna be okay.

1:22:20.542 --> 1:22:23.243
It's gonna be okay, lindo.

1:22:23.277 --> 1:22:27.615
Oh, lindo, shh.

1:22:32.486 --> 1:22:34.656
It's gonna be okay.

1:22:34.689 --> 1:22:36.356
Shh.

1:22:48.135 --> 1:22:50.705
Shh, shh, it's okay,

1:22:50.738 --> 1:22:52.707
it's okay.

1:22:52.740 --> 1:22:56.477
Shh. It's all gonna be okay.

1:22:56.511 --> 1:22:59.781
It's all gonna be okay.
It's all gonna be okay.

1:22:59.814 --> 1:23:02.082
- Aah!
- It's all gonna be okay.

1:23:02.115 --> 1:23:04.218
It's all gonna be okay!

1:23:04.251 --> 1:23:07.421
Lindo, no, lindo.

1:24:19.861 --> 1:24:22.530
- Does it hurt?

1:24:22.564 --> 1:24:25.800
But then it's over.

1:24:42.316 --> 1:24:44.652
The other way won't kill you.

1:24:51.458 --> 1:24:53.327
- Morning.

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:55.162
- Afternoon.

1:24:55.195 --> 1:24:58.332
- One, two, one, two.

1:24:58.365 --> 1:25:01.335
Come on one,
two, three, one, two.

1:25:01.368 --> 1:25:03.771
Oh, yes, bitch there you go.
Do it.

1:25:03.805 --> 1:25:05.607
- Okay, stop, please.

1:25:32.634 --> 1:25:34.836
- Growl for the camera.
- Grrr.

1:25:34.869 --> 1:25:36.303
- Louder, lindo, louder.

1:25:36.336 --> 1:25:39.306
- Grrr!
- Again, again!

1:25:39.339 --> 1:25:43.210
- Grrr!
- Howl, Will, howl.

1:26:21.816 --> 1:26:27.522
No, no, please. Please no.

1:26:31.258 --> 1:26:33.995
I'm sorry.

1:26:34.028 --> 1:26:36.931
I'm sorry.

1:26:53.447 --> 1:26:56.249
Guess I gotta get used
to your being here, huh?

1:27:05.593 --> 1:27:07.294
You look better.

1:27:09.396 --> 1:27:11.498
So do you.

1:27:14.635 --> 1:27:16.336
- Thank you.

1:27:24.779 --> 1:27:26.948
What happens now?

1:27:29.550 --> 1:27:31.953
What does that mean?

1:27:41.562 --> 1:27:46.000
- Hi, Will, I'm Dr. Miller.

1:27:46.033 --> 1:27:49.302
May I come in? Mind if I sit?

1:27:55.408 --> 1:27:56.677
Thank you.

1:28:00.347 --> 1:28:04.317
So how are you feeling?
You feeling better?

1:28:06.854 --> 1:28:08.421
- Yeah.

1:28:10.758 --> 1:28:14.762
- Okay, good.

1:28:14.796 --> 1:28:18.032
'Cause, you've been on
quite the journey.

1:28:18.065 --> 1:28:21.636
- Not as epic as "Homeward
Bound," but...close.

1:28:24.739 --> 1:28:27.008
- I see you still have
your sense of humor.

1:28:32.747 --> 1:28:34.982
- She thinks I'm funny.

1:28:37.118 --> 1:28:38.719
- Who's that?

1:28:42.056 --> 1:28:43.658
- A wolf.

1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:50.430
Well, a man in a wolf costume.

1:28:50.463 --> 1:28:51.766
- Huh.

1:28:51.799 --> 1:28:53.366
- Sometimes a child.

1:28:57.071 --> 1:28:58.739
- And where are they
right now?

1:28:58.773 --> 1:29:01.609
Are they...
sitting in that corner?

1:29:09.150 --> 1:29:10.985
- He was, but...

1:29:14.522 --> 1:29:17.024
You seem to have
scared him away.

1:29:29.670 --> 1:29:31.471
I thought I killed my mom.

1:29:38.179 --> 1:29:39.914
I-I didn't.

1:29:42.717 --> 1:29:45.519
I didn't, right?

1:29:45.553 --> 1:29:46.888
I didn't?

1:29:46.921 --> 1:29:50.423
- No, Will,
you didn't kill your mom.

1:29:51.826 --> 1:29:54.896
In fact, she was here
about a half-hour ago.

1:29:54.929 --> 1:29:58.532
She wanted to see you,
but she was very upset

1:29:58.566 --> 1:30:01.869
and I thought it was best
for her not to see you.

1:30:01.903 --> 1:30:03.704
So I asked her to leave.

1:30:11.112 --> 1:30:15.016
Let's talk about you, okay?

1:30:17.785 --> 1:30:23.490
Would you say that there are
some very serious things

1:30:23.524 --> 1:30:24.959
that are holding you back,

1:30:24.992 --> 1:30:28.963
preventing you
from feeling normal?

1:30:29.964 --> 1:30:33.868
- I would say that, yeah, yes.

1:30:35.202 --> 1:30:37.004
- Okay.

1:30:37.038 --> 1:30:40.174
And that's why I'm here

1:30:40.207 --> 1:30:44.178
to help you uncover
those things

1:30:44.211 --> 1:30:49.583
so that you can feel happy
and whole...

1:30:49.617 --> 1:30:53.821
and normal.

1:30:57.091 --> 1:31:01.729
- Well, I like you.

1:31:04.565 --> 1:31:09.537
- Now, bottom line is,

1:31:09.570 --> 1:31:11.839
are you willing to
do the work?

1:31:31.859 --> 1:31:34.028
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

1:31:44.805 --> 1:31:46.540
Six.

1:31:56.851 --> 1:31:58.019
That's two more pounds.

1:31:58.052 --> 1:32:00.554
- Oh, yeah.
- You got it.

1:32:00.588 --> 1:32:02.189
- Yes, it is.

1:32:02.223 --> 1:32:03.991
- See how steady?

1:32:28.382 --> 1:32:30.818
- Thank you.
