01:47.333 --> 01:50.200
- The criminal mind...

01:50.266 --> 01:52.133
For the past 200 years,

01:52.200 --> 01:54.867
scientists, sociologists
and other folks

01:54.934 --> 01:57.033
who've read
about such things

01:57.100 --> 02:00.233
have debated whether
a person commits a violent act

02:00.300 --> 02:04.367
because of their environment
or their biological makeup.

02:04.433 --> 02:07.033
What turns on the red
crime light in a man's brain?

02:07.100 --> 02:09.667
If we find the cause,

02:09.734 --> 02:11.967
can we eliminate the effect?

02:12.033 --> 02:14.166
Can we end violence

02:14.233 --> 02:15.834
now and forever?

02:35.967 --> 02:39.300
Prisoner number 0-0-G-1-1-5,

02:39.367 --> 02:41.300
Detective Bruno Goergan,

02:41.367 --> 02:43.967
convicted March 15th, 2000,

02:44.033 --> 02:46.633
illegal possession
and sale of firearms,

02:46.700 --> 02:48.300
murder in the first degree.

02:48.367 --> 02:51.333
Sentence: 36 years.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.934
Up for parole in 18.

03:06.066 --> 03:08.433
- You know that guy?

03:08.500 --> 03:10.333
No.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.700
He's just so fucking ugly.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.834
- "He's just so fucking ugly."

03:14.900 --> 03:18.033
This guy.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.367
- When I first saw you,
I thought,

03:20.433 --> 03:23.834
"What the fuck is
Johnny Basil doing in Oz?"

03:23.900 --> 03:27.333
And then I remembered last year
you went to narcotics, right?

03:27.400 --> 03:29.967
One of the greaseballs told me
your name was Desmond Mobay?

03:30.033 --> 03:31.133
Huh?

03:31.200 --> 03:32.600
- You gonna blow my cover?

03:32.667 --> 03:35.333
- Depends.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.600
- On what I do for you?

03:37.667 --> 03:39.633
- None of the inmates know
I'm a cop.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.133
It was part of my deal
when I turned state's evidence.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.500
I got a new identity, too.

03:43.567 --> 03:46.000
Now, scumbags out there
find out the truth,

03:46.066 --> 03:50.266
I'm prime beef for any asshole
looking to up his cred.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.700
- And so?

03:51.767 --> 03:54.066
- So, one hand washes the other,
my brother in blue.

03:54.133 --> 03:57.133
- You know what I remember
the most about you,

03:57.200 --> 04:00.433
when we were working
the streets together?

04:00.500 --> 04:02.033
What a bully you were.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.700
Strong-arming people
when there was no need.

04:04.767 --> 04:07.600
You were always
a bad cop, Goergan.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.533
I wadn't surprised
when I heard you went down.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.867
Oh, so, you do want me to tell
the guys you're undercover?

04:15.900 --> 04:19.367
I would be happy to help you
in any way I can.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.834
- Glad we understand each other.

04:21.900 --> 04:24.333
Excuse me there, Butch.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.066
- Butch?
Yo.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.567
- Normally when a police
officer's brought into Oz

04:30.633 --> 04:32.767
I give them
special counseling.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.667
- Why?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.367
It's going to
be tough for you

04:38.433 --> 04:40.467
going from
a position of authority

04:40.533 --> 04:42.300
to being strip searched.

04:42.367 --> 04:45.000
You might feel humiliated.

04:45.066 --> 04:46.266
- Not me.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.033
- Vulnerable.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.100
- Uh-uh.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.533
- Okay, that's fine,

04:51.600 --> 04:53.433
but if you should experience
feelings like that,

04:53.500 --> 04:55.467
I just want you
to know I'm here.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.500
- Thanks.
Later.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.567
You know, my wife's an ex-nun.
- Really?

05:03.633 --> 05:06.600
- Yeah, she fucks
like a $500 whore.

05:06.667 --> 05:10.100
Must be all those years
of pent-up chastity.

05:24.934 --> 05:26.934
- Yo, T, you know what I hate
more than anything?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.333
- What's that, Mondo?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.467
- It's white trash
trying to be thugs.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.433
- I feel you.
I hate that, too.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.467
- How about you, pussy?

05:34.533 --> 05:37.300
How you feel about that, huh?
- What I hate...

05:37.367 --> 05:38.734
is jive-ass niggas.
both: Oh.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.300
How the fuck is this
you watching my back?

05:56.367 --> 05:57.967
- I got a C.O. There
as soon as I could.

05:58.033 --> 06:00.000
- You should've pulled
those apes off me.

06:00.066 --> 06:02.900
- Apes, yeah.

06:02.967 --> 06:04.834
Niggas, yeah.

06:04.900 --> 06:08.033
I jump in and save you,
a fucking white redneck asshole,

06:08.100 --> 06:09.667
I might as well pack up
and leave Oz.

06:09.734 --> 06:11.333
- Well, then maybe
you better start packing

06:11.400 --> 06:13.166
'cause anything like this
fucking happens again,

06:13.233 --> 06:14.667
everyone's gonna
know who you are,

06:14.734 --> 06:17.133
and you're
a dead man, Johnny.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.133
- Hey, Mobay.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.066
Did you forget?

06:29.133 --> 06:31.133
- What?

06:31.200 --> 06:33.934
- If you wanna join us,
you gotta kill somebody.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.633
- I haven't forgotten.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.800
- The new man doesn't want
any violence in Emerald City.

06:38.867 --> 06:40.500
So, if you're gonna
do the deed,

06:40.567 --> 06:43.500
make it look like
an accident.

06:43.567 --> 06:45.600
Do it far away from here.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.700
- I gotcha, man.

07:07.066 --> 07:09.367
Hill.
Hill.

07:09.433 --> 07:11.300
- I'm asleep.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.433
Hear that?
That's me snoring.

07:22.433 --> 07:24.300
- I need your help.

07:24.367 --> 07:26.367
- I don't give people help.

07:26.433 --> 07:29.500
- Adebisi and the others say
they will let me in

07:29.567 --> 07:31.867
if I kill somebody.

07:33.233 --> 07:35.033
- And what?

07:35.100 --> 07:36.500
You want me to volunteer
to be your victim?

07:36.567 --> 07:38.233
- No.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.633
I have decided who to kill,

07:39.700 --> 07:41.467
but I need your
cooperation to do it.

07:41.533 --> 07:44.500
- Man, that shit you're snorting
is rottin' your brain out.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.200
I ain't helping
you kill nobody.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.700
- But...
- No, no way, no how.

07:48.767 --> 07:51.000
- But...
- Hey, look, shut up, Mobay!

07:51.066 --> 07:53.033
I'm tired of hearing
your lips flap.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.867
Let me get
some fucking sleep.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.233
- We got problems.
- What?

08:06.300 --> 08:07.900
- My cell mate Hill
knows you're a cop.

08:07.967 --> 08:09.734
Shit.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.667
How?
- Who knows how?

08:11.734 --> 08:13.266
He says he'll keep quiet
for a price.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.567
He wants a meeting.
- Where?

08:14.633 --> 08:16.367
- Dress factory's
freight elevator.

08:16.433 --> 08:17.700
Now, I say we tip his chair

08:17.767 --> 08:20.033
and let him go tumbling
down the shaft.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.600
- Right.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.133
Fuck.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.867
Are you sure
this guy's coming?

08:26.934 --> 08:29.533
- Yes.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.633
- Geez, you don't know
how good you got it

08:32.700 --> 08:34.567
till it's gone, man.

08:34.633 --> 08:36.266
All those times I moaned
about walking the beat,

08:36.333 --> 08:39.200
I'd give my fucking right nut
to be in the snow

08:39.266 --> 08:42.333
working the fucking
'Spic day parade.

08:43.333 --> 08:45.433
- Okay, Mobay.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.100
I'm here, man,
what you want?

08:48.166 --> 08:50.000
- You think you got me
over a barrel, don't you?

08:50.066 --> 08:51.233
- What?
- So long, Butch.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.600
- What the fuck are
you doing, man?

08:52.667 --> 08:54.200
Fuck you doing?
- Wait, wait, let me.

08:54.266 --> 08:55.233
Let me.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.633
- Mobay, for Christ sake.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.233
Ah, Mobay!

08:58.300 --> 08:59.433
For Christ sake,
what are you doing?

08:59.500 --> 09:02.834
please, man, please!

09:02.900 --> 09:05.166
- Fuck me!

09:06.166 --> 09:09.467
- You should've let me
tell you the plan.

09:09.533 --> 09:11.200
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

09:11.266 --> 09:13.800
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

09:16.667 --> 09:18.400
- Lockdown!

09:18.467 --> 09:20.967
Lockdown!

09:21.033 --> 09:22.600
- What the fuck happened?

09:22.667 --> 09:25.000
- Someone died,
an accident.

09:25.066 --> 09:27.800
Far from Emerald City.

09:36.166 --> 09:39.667
- I'm seriously considering
moving to another cell.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.867
- Relax, brother,
the worst is over.

09:42.934 --> 09:45.266
- Yeah, right.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.433
- Hey.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.066
- What are you doing here?

10:02.133 --> 10:04.266
I thought we agreed
you shouldn't come visit.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.934
Hill thought
he recognized you.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.600
- I am here because
I am worried about you, partner.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.633
You're supposed
to be e-mailing me regularly.

10:10.700 --> 10:11.934
Not only don't
I hear from you,

10:12.000 --> 10:13.867
but when I do,
the reports make no sense.

10:13.934 --> 10:16.900
- I was in the hole
for a few days.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.200
- Are you using?

10:18.266 --> 10:19.433
No.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.834
- You are.
I can see it in your eyes.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.533
- Okay, but I had to.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.967
- That's it,
I'm telling the lieutenant

10:26.033 --> 10:27.400
to pull you out of here.
- No.

10:27.467 --> 10:29.367
Schmand wants the job done,

10:29.433 --> 10:31.233
and I'm so fucking close
to busting these guys.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.367
Look, I know I fucked up,
but I can turn it around.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.166
I know I can, Kina.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.867
Trust me.

10:41.667 --> 10:42.867
- Okay.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.934
But I want to hear
from you every day.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.934
Every goddamn day.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.300
- Warden, we need
to touch you up a bit.

11:04.367 --> 11:06.133
- Touch me up?
- This is Cassandra and Betty,

11:06.200 --> 11:09.000
they're makeup and hair.
- What's the hubbub?

11:09.066 --> 11:11.533
- The warden is shooting
a public service announcement.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.233
- Oh, that's right,
I forgot.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.266
- Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor

11:15.333 --> 11:18.266
to come before you...

11:18.333 --> 11:20.033
- Are you all right?

11:20.100 --> 11:21.367
- I may be getting the flu.

11:21.433 --> 11:25.433
- I believe a man
has to be prepared

11:25.500 --> 11:27.100
to accept responsibility...
- Quick as you can, guys.

11:27.166 --> 11:30.266
- Warden, your wife is here.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.867
- Mary.
- We need to talk.

11:32.934 --> 11:35.133
- Uh, excuse me.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.367
- Warden, we're moments
away here, sir, please.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.433
- Excuse me.
Come on, come on.

11:44.767 --> 11:45.934
- What's the matter?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.767
- I just got a call
from a reporter

11:47.834 --> 11:49.600
asking about your brother.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.467
- Well, I knew
this was coming.

11:51.533 --> 11:53.066
- He said that tomorrow
"The Tribune" is

11:53.133 --> 11:54.834
breaking the story that

11:54.900 --> 11:56.533
Mark is serving a life sentence
for murder

11:56.600 --> 11:58.333
and did you
have any comment.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.000
- I got a lot of comments,
none of them printable.

12:02.066 --> 12:05.233
- Warden, I'm sorry.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.967
We were trying to make
our little movie here.

12:07.033 --> 12:08.934
We're on a very,
very tight schedule.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.967
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.200
- Thank you so much.

12:15.266 --> 12:16.834
- Sorry about that.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.633
- Okay, you guys, just
sign off on him, all right,

12:18.700 --> 12:20.700
so, we can get this over with.
- Okay, um...

12:20.767 --> 12:22.367
- This isn't such
a terrible thing.

12:22.433 --> 12:24.200
- Oh, no?
- We anticipated that

12:24.266 --> 12:28.000
some dedicated journalist would
eventually dig up the dirt.

12:28.066 --> 12:29.400
There's a way

12:29.467 --> 12:32.000
to use this to our advantage.
- How?

12:32.066 --> 12:33.400
- Your brother committed murder,
yes,

12:33.467 --> 12:36.200
but you got him
to turn himself in.

12:36.266 --> 12:38.133
Three months after the fact.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.934
- Press doesn't have
to know when you knew.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.600
- I'm starting to feel like
Ronald fucking Reagan.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.166
- We also leaked the news
that your daughter was raped.

12:45.233 --> 12:48.567
- Public will love the fact that
you know all sides of crime.

12:49.934 --> 12:51.934
- I'm not gonna
exploit Arnette's rape

12:52.000 --> 12:53.633
just to get elected.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.633
- Leo, people don't
vote for candidates

12:55.700 --> 12:58.166
because of what they believe
or their position statements

12:58.233 --> 12:59.867
or any of that shit.

12:59.934 --> 13:03.967
They elect a father,
a husband,

13:04.033 --> 13:05.934
a good old guy
they can chug a beer with,

13:06.000 --> 13:10.066
someone who understands pain

13:10.133 --> 13:13.033
because he's suffered too.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.100
And you've suffered, Leo.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.000
All I'm saying is,

13:17.066 --> 13:20.000
let them weep for you.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.600
- I said no.
That's no.

13:22.667 --> 13:26.700
- My advice is get
your hat out of the ring.

13:26.767 --> 13:29.433
I need a lieutenant governor
who's got balls.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.800
Open the goddamn gate!

13:33.000 --> 13:35.934
- I'm a family man,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.200
and there's nothing harder
for a family man

13:38.266 --> 13:40.266
than to see
those he loves suffer

13:40.333 --> 13:42.433
or cause suffering.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.834
My brother's crime
devastated us.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.767
My daughter's rape did, too.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.767
- There's a new study out
which claims that some people

14:02.834 --> 14:06.100
are wired
to commit violent crimes.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.834
That they have defects
in their brain.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.667
That they have less gray matter
in their pre-frontal lobe.

14:11.734 --> 14:14.066
Just behind the eyes
they're missing the piece

14:14.133 --> 14:16.233
that keeps rage inside.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.633
If true,

14:17.700 --> 14:19.533
those people

14:19.600 --> 14:23.000
are predestined
to rape and murder.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.467
They cannot be
held accountable.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.834
Anatomy is destiny.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.567
- I don't give a fuck about
this goddamn toilet paper!

14:32.633 --> 14:34.867
You know, take your fucking
toilet paper, all right?

14:34.934 --> 14:36.834
- Oh, shit.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.133
- Knock it off!

14:41.200 --> 14:42.400
- Lockdown!

14:42.467 --> 14:45.266
Lockdown!

14:45.333 --> 14:48.200
- McManus, where's your
fucking sense of fun?

14:57.333 --> 14:59.033
- Hello.
- Tim?

14:59.100 --> 15:01.500
- Yeah.
- Diane.

15:07.266 --> 15:10.667
- Yeah?
- How are you?

15:10.734 --> 15:12.300
- I'm good.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.133
- I wrote you,
but I didn't hear back.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.233
Did you get my letter?

15:16.300 --> 15:19.200
- Yeah, I got it.
I been busy.

15:19.266 --> 15:22.000
- I heard,
you're running Unit B now.

15:22.066 --> 15:23.600
- My boys behaving
themselves?

15:23.667 --> 15:26.734
- Diane, what do you want?

15:26.800 --> 15:30.000
- To see if you're okay.
- I'm good, I gotta go.

15:35.767 --> 15:37.166
- Oh, man.

15:37.233 --> 15:39.867
Tim.

15:39.934 --> 15:42.633
- Hey.
- How's things?

15:42.700 --> 15:44.967
- The truth?

15:45.033 --> 15:47.700
I miss Diane.
I miss Em City.

15:47.767 --> 15:50.166
I'm constantly
constipated.

15:50.233 --> 15:52.567
I've managed to completely
and literally fuck up

15:52.633 --> 15:54.166
my entire life.
That's how I am.

15:54.233 --> 15:56.667
- Constipation--
that you can fix.

15:56.734 --> 15:59.300
- Right.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.900
- Wanna grab a beer?

16:01.967 --> 16:04.600
- No thanks,
I got a date.

16:04.667 --> 16:05.967
- Every time I ask you
to do something,

16:06.033 --> 16:08.266
you're otherwise engaged,
I'm getting paranoid.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.033
You pissed at me?

16:10.100 --> 16:11.800
- When Glynn fired me,
what did you do?

16:11.867 --> 16:13.166
- I called you immediately.

16:13.233 --> 16:14.700
- Oh, yeah, you were
very sympathetic,

16:14.767 --> 16:17.066
and then you took my job.
- Only temporarily.

16:17.133 --> 16:19.133
I told Glynn I did not
wanna replace you.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.867
- I brought you in to Oz!

16:20.934 --> 16:22.333
When I was fired,
you should've quit.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.533
- Tim.
- I gotta go.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.233
- Tim, you know,
give me a break here.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.633
- Kareem Said.

16:57.700 --> 16:58.834
According to this file,

16:58.900 --> 17:01.033
you are one incredible
pain in the ass.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.767
- Well, that is only
one interpretation.

17:02.834 --> 17:05.633
Another could be that I strive
for justice where there is none.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.600
- What I strive for
is peace and quiet.

17:08.667 --> 17:10.767
My mandate from
Warden Glynn is simple:

17:10.834 --> 17:12.200
no violence.

17:12.266 --> 17:14.100
- I applaud you
on your mandate.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.300
I abhor violence.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.567
- That is incredibly
sweet of you.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.166
I'm thinking of
making some changes

17:19.233 --> 17:21.834
and I'm hoping you're not
gonna stir up any trouble.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.433
- Depends.
What kind of changes?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.934
- Patience, patience.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.934
We must be as patient
with others

17:28.000 --> 17:30.066
as we expect Allah
to be with us.

17:30.133 --> 17:33.000
Now you don't mind
if I quote you, do you?

17:33.066 --> 17:34.667
Found this in the bottom
of the drawer.

17:34.734 --> 17:36.233
McManus must've
left it behind.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.600
I gave it a quick read.
- And?

17:38.667 --> 17:40.333
- Didn't really hold
my interest.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.900
Too self-righteous.
You can go.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.767
- $100.
$100.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.467
- That's all for you,
if you want it.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.633
Ha!

18:06.000 --> 18:08.433
- It's real fuckin' funny.

18:10.633 --> 18:13.700
- Prisoner number 0-0-K-2-5-1,

18:13.767 --> 18:17.033
Kevin Ketchum,
AKA Supreme Allah.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.133
Convicted March 22nd, 2000,

18:22.200 --> 18:23.900
murder in the second degree.

18:23.967 --> 18:26.333
Sentence: 25 years.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.767
Up for parole in 10.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.266
- This is your sponsor.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.600
He's gonna help acclimate you
to life in Emerald City.

18:32.667 --> 18:36.000
Kevin Ketchum,
Kareem Said.

18:36.066 --> 18:38.600
- My government name
is Ketchum.

18:38.667 --> 18:42.066
My real name
is Supreme Allah.

18:42.133 --> 18:44.066
- All right,
let's go, Allah.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.166
- Who's that?
- Supreme Allah.

19:01.233 --> 19:03.400
Knew him back
on the corner.

19:03.467 --> 19:05.934
- What kind of a name
is the Supreme Allah?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.233
- He's a five percenter.

19:08.300 --> 19:11.233
- A five center what?

19:11.300 --> 19:13.000
- He's a five percenter.

19:13.066 --> 19:15.100
He believes that 5%
of all black men are enlightened

19:15.166 --> 19:16.600
with the true understanding
of life.

19:16.667 --> 19:19.700
- Yeah, they also believe
that the black man is god

19:19.767 --> 19:21.367
and that we whiteys
are the devil.

19:21.433 --> 19:23.667
- They're like Muslims
except they smoke weed,

19:23.734 --> 19:27.033
they deal drugs,
they do what they gotta do.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.467
- Oh, fuck.

19:28.533 --> 19:32.200
He's gonna be my cell mate.
Shit!

19:32.266 --> 19:34.300
- Bye-bye.

19:36.433 --> 19:37.500
- Peace, black man.
- Look, look.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.500
I ain't buying
what you selling, dawg.

19:39.567 --> 19:42.000
Met a lot of you five percenters
along the years,

19:42.066 --> 19:45.233
with your prophet Musa Saying
how much the Earth weighs shit.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.367
You know, we stuck in here.
We stuck in here together.

19:48.433 --> 19:51.734
And I don't need you
preaching me, you understand?

19:51.800 --> 19:54.266
- Yeah, all right.
- All right then.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.700
- Call you Poet, huh?

20:02.767 --> 20:04.800
- Damn skippy
they call me Poet.

20:04.867 --> 20:06.200
- Can I read some
of your stuff?

20:06.266 --> 20:08.166
- Why do you wanna read
any of my stuff?

20:08.233 --> 20:09.700
- Like poetry.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.700
You know,
I suck at writing myself.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.333
- Start on page 16.
- Thanks.

20:18.400 --> 20:22.300
- Some of my shit got
put in that anthology.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.033
Damn!

20:29.533 --> 20:30.867
- Yo, this is good, man.

20:30.934 --> 20:34.133
- Fuck me, man.
No more pens.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.233
- Yo, yo.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.967
- You must fall in line
behind us.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.533
- I ain't got no problem
working with you.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.066
- You're not hearing
what I'm saying.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.433
- Oh, I hear clearly, Arif.

21:03.500 --> 21:07.633
Thing is, you don't own me
any more than the devil does.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.734
- You will obey me.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.000
You don't wanna
be touching me, son.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.200
- This is getting us nowhere.

21:16.266 --> 21:17.900
Why don't you
all just back off?

21:17.967 --> 21:21.433
Supreme Allah,
you call yourself Muslim,

21:21.500 --> 21:24.000
but we believe
that your way,

21:24.066 --> 21:25.667
that is a corruption
of the truth.

21:25.734 --> 21:27.567
We don't want
you poisoning the minds

21:27.633 --> 21:30.600
of the young brothers
here in Oz.

21:30.667 --> 21:34.266
- I'm gonna speak my mind
while I'm here.

21:34.333 --> 21:37.133
And whoever listens,
listens.

21:38.367 --> 21:40.200
Whoever don't...

21:40.266 --> 21:41.867
be damned.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.600
- Thank you, Officer.

21:58.667 --> 21:59.934
- You want me in or out?

22:02.633 --> 22:05.266
- Out.

22:16.900 --> 22:20.100
- There you are.
- Yes.

22:21.734 --> 22:23.567
What are you up to,
Adebisi?

22:23.633 --> 22:25.333
- Me?

22:25.400 --> 22:27.367
Nothing.
- Nothing?

22:27.433 --> 22:30.000
So, how am I to be included
in your nothing?

22:30.066 --> 22:32.000
- The earth is
about to quake.

22:32.066 --> 22:34.467
I came to warn you.
Take shelter.

22:34.533 --> 22:38.233
- How big a quake?
- Big.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.633
But you,
you can be safe with me.

22:40.700 --> 22:43.667
- Once again, you honor me
with your offer of protection.

22:43.734 --> 22:45.233
- And once again
you refuse?

22:45.300 --> 22:46.433
- Regretfully.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.200
- You can ask a girl
out on a date

22:48.266 --> 22:50.567
so many times
and get refused.

22:50.633 --> 22:53.834
- You could just tell me
what's going on.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.333
- Count!

22:56.400 --> 23:00.567
- You'll find out
soon enough, eh?

23:00.633 --> 23:03.400
- I have decided
to junk the council

23:03.467 --> 23:05.800
that used to meet regularly

23:05.867 --> 23:08.567
and replace that system
with trustees

23:08.633 --> 23:12.000
who will be responsible
for citing grievances

23:12.066 --> 23:14.600
and maintaining order.

23:14.667 --> 23:17.000
These trustees will be

23:17.066 --> 23:19.300
Simon Adebisi,

23:19.367 --> 23:21.700
Chuckie Pancamo,

23:21.767 --> 23:24.834
and Enrique Morales.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.166
Now, having met with
each of you individually,

23:27.233 --> 23:29.400
I've decided
to transfer several of you

23:29.467 --> 23:30.867
back to Gen Pop.

23:30.934 --> 23:35.700
The following men will
follow Officer Johnson out:

23:35.767 --> 23:38.667
97H813,

23:38.734 --> 23:40.000
Henke;

23:40.066 --> 23:43.033
99S812,

23:43.100 --> 23:44.600
Sands;

23:44.667 --> 23:47.667
98B643,

23:47.734 --> 23:48.934
Blakely;

23:49.000 --> 23:52.066
97S532,

23:52.133 --> 23:53.400
Simpson;

23:53.467 --> 23:56.200
95J932,

23:56.266 --> 23:58.133
Jarvis;

23:58.200 --> 24:01.467
98H432,

24:01.533 --> 24:03.533
Hoyt.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.900
- This sucks!

24:04.967 --> 24:07.400
- No one asked your opinion,
Hoyt.

24:07.467 --> 24:09.000
- That's enough out of you.

24:09.066 --> 24:11.967
Grab your stuff!

24:31.500 --> 24:33.300
- Now, this is nuts.

24:33.367 --> 24:36.734
Making Adebisi, Pancamo,
and Morales trustees?

24:36.800 --> 24:39.567
I mean, they're the three worst
motherfuckers in this place!

24:39.633 --> 24:41.633
And transferring
all the Aryans and bikers?

24:41.700 --> 24:42.767
I mean, what kind
of logic is that?

24:42.834 --> 24:44.700
- I'm not Tim McManus.

24:44.767 --> 24:47.133
I'm not looking
to create some Oz version

24:47.200 --> 24:48.700
of the rainbow coalition.

24:48.767 --> 24:50.133
I reviewed their records.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.300
All of them have repeated
incidents of violence.

24:52.367 --> 24:53.767
- And Adebisi doesn't?

24:53.834 --> 24:55.800
- You're just gonna have
to learn to trust me.

24:55.867 --> 24:58.633
- I wish you'd learn to
discuss policy changes with me

24:58.700 --> 24:59.934
before you announce them.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.400
- Not my style.
- Clearly.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.233
- You don't like it,
you can follow Hoyt

25:04.300 --> 25:05.734
and the rest of 'em
out the door.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.066
- You know what, I will.
- I'll start the paperwork.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.166
- The sooner the better.

25:10.233 --> 25:13.734
- The sooner.
- Yeah.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.500
- Ah, yeah.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.600
- Did you know about this?

25:23.667 --> 25:25.300
That you'd be made
a trustee?

25:25.367 --> 25:27.266
Yeah, yeah,

25:27.333 --> 25:28.667
but I was sworn to secrecy.

25:28.734 --> 25:30.600
- How come I wasn't made
a trustee?

25:30.667 --> 25:32.100
- Ask Querns.
- And how come

25:32.166 --> 25:34.266
all these new arrivals,
none of them is Muslim.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.200
- Ask Querns.

25:36.266 --> 25:37.967
- We had a deal, Adebisi.

25:38.033 --> 25:40.400
- That's true.
We did.

25:40.467 --> 25:43.433
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got business to do.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.300
- No, no, no.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.500
- We have to talk, Querns.
- Later.

26:00.567 --> 26:04.000
- Now!
- Johnson.

26:04.066 --> 26:06.066
We'll talk...

26:06.133 --> 26:08.200
later.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.900
- Back off, back off.
Hey! Hey!

26:26.967 --> 26:28.533
Officers!

26:28.600 --> 26:30.900
- Get him off now!
Move it!

26:32.300 --> 26:34.734
Man, we gotta get him
to the hospital.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.133
This is Unit B.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.166
Get a fucking gurney
over here!

26:48.066 --> 26:49.166
- What happened?

26:49.233 --> 26:52.767
- He's been raped.

26:52.834 --> 26:54.467
Gloria, you don't have to--

26:54.533 --> 26:55.934
- I'm fine.
- No.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.367
- No, Tim, I'm fine.

26:57.433 --> 26:59.767
Let's drape and prep
for an anoscopy.

27:02.467 --> 27:04.633
- You know, when I was first
elected governor,

27:04.700 --> 27:06.600
crime was out of control,

27:06.667 --> 27:08.900
but we went to work fighting
for three strikes...

27:08.967 --> 27:10.300
- Hey, can you turn that down?

27:10.367 --> 27:12.667
- I'm waiting for my soap
to come back on.

27:12.734 --> 27:14.734
Mac just left Felicia...

27:14.800 --> 27:17.066
Again.
- Turn it the fuck down.

27:17.133 --> 27:20.300
- Why are you always
so grumpy?

27:20.367 --> 27:22.834
Hey, what you doing?
- Painting.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.467
- Well, they just painted
our cells a couple weeks ago.

27:24.533 --> 27:27.166
- Painting a mural, asshole,
a portrait.

27:27.233 --> 27:29.734
- Of who?
- Myself.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.800
I want to leave something
behind after they execute me.

27:32.867 --> 27:34.633
- Miles, what makes you think
the next guy in that cell

27:34.700 --> 27:36.800
will want to spend his last days
staring at your ugly ass.

27:36.867 --> 27:38.266
- You calling me ugly,
black boy?

27:38.333 --> 27:39.600
- Motherfucker.

27:39.667 --> 27:42.567
- Are my little darlings
raising their voices?

27:42.633 --> 27:43.967
Do we need a timeout?

27:44.033 --> 27:45.700
- Lopresti,
how come you still here?

27:45.767 --> 27:47.467
Shirley Bellinger
told the warden

27:47.533 --> 27:48.667
you were fucking her
every night.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.433
- Yeah, that bitch
almost got me fired,

27:50.500 --> 27:53.233
but I was able to persuade Glynn
that she's a lying sack of shit.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.066
- But she wadn't lying.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.834
- You were eating that pussy
like chicken chow mein.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.233
Goddamn!

27:58.300 --> 28:01.233
- I don't wanna hear
anymore talk about that cunt.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.500
Got me?

28:08.300 --> 28:09.633
- Things sure are
different around here

28:09.700 --> 28:12.100
without old Shirley.
- Yeah.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.667
- That's been happening a lot.

28:18.734 --> 28:20.533
- Yeah, fag,
you keep me up at night.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.667
- Jeez, God forbid you shouldn't
get your beauty sleep.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.400
- Maybe you should be
in the hospital, man.

28:24.467 --> 28:26.533
No, don't wanna die
in a hospital.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.000
- You'd rather die in here?

28:28.066 --> 28:30.667
- I'd rather expire
sunning myself on the Riviera

28:30.734 --> 28:32.767
in the arms of
a 17-year-old Adonis.

28:32.834 --> 28:34.500
But c'est la vie.

28:34.567 --> 28:36.200
- Still, maybe you should
have yourself checked out.

28:36.266 --> 28:38.900
- Thank you, Moses,
for your concern.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.467
- You going fag, Deyell?

28:40.533 --> 28:41.967
- When you gonna
shut the fuck up, man?

28:42.033 --> 28:43.867
- When I die, nigger.

28:43.934 --> 28:46.200
- Ow, fuck!
My hand!

28:46.266 --> 28:47.700
My fucking hand!

28:47.767 --> 28:49.300
- Oh, fuck!

28:51.667 --> 28:53.533
- You gotta remember, Deyell,
you hit a wall,

28:53.600 --> 28:55.066
generally the wall wins.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.734
- Yeah, Moses here is not known
for his mental muscle.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.767
- I got more brains in my little
finger than you, Lopresti.

28:59.834 --> 29:02.600
- Well, right now your little
finger is in little pieces.

29:02.667 --> 29:04.367
All right, listen,
try to keep this cast clean.

29:04.433 --> 29:06.100
You're gonna have it on
for six weeks.

29:06.166 --> 29:07.700
All done.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.934
Dr. Nathan, you ain't been up
to see Ginzburg lately.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.533
- No, I took a short
leave of absence.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.533
I assumed Dr. Prestopnik
was examining him.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.533
- Prestopnik ain't been
up there one time.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.033
- Quit yapping, Deyell.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.033
- Again.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.033
Have you been having chills,
night sweats,

29:32.100 --> 29:34.633
shortness of breath?
- Yes, a trifecta.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.834
- I should probably transfer you
to the AIDS ward.

29:38.900 --> 29:42.467
- When I got the death penalty
for suffocating Antonio Nappa,

29:42.533 --> 29:45.066
I thought,
"oh, this'll be fun."

29:45.133 --> 29:46.633
- Fun?

29:46.700 --> 29:48.367
- See what kills me first:

29:48.433 --> 29:50.967
the state or the disease.

29:51.033 --> 29:54.633
Guess the disease
is winning.

30:15.166 --> 30:16.633
No.

30:19.967 --> 30:23.767
- Prisoner number 0-0-K-4-1-4,

30:23.834 --> 30:25.166
Patrick Keenan,

30:25.233 --> 30:28.000
convicted March 25, 2000...

30:28.066 --> 30:31.233
- Assault in the first degree,
rape.

30:32.266 --> 30:34.467
Sentence: 12 years,

30:34.533 --> 30:37.200
up for parole in seven.

30:37.266 --> 30:39.300
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Hey.

30:39.367 --> 30:41.600
- Have you met Patrick Keenan?

30:41.667 --> 30:44.767
- No.
- Patrick, this is Ryan O'Reily.

30:44.834 --> 30:46.433
- Yeah, I heard of you.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.834
You and your brother used
to run the Bridget Street gang.

30:48.900 --> 30:51.467
- Yeah.

30:51.533 --> 30:54.367
Hey, that's a--
that's a nice shamrock.

30:54.433 --> 30:55.800
- Yeah, thanks.

30:55.867 --> 30:57.233
My lucky charm.

30:57.300 --> 30:58.500
- So, what'd they catch
you doing?

30:58.567 --> 31:00.467
- Rape and assault.

31:00.533 --> 31:01.767
- That so?

31:01.834 --> 31:05.200
- Patrick's the one
who did Dr. Nathan.

31:05.266 --> 31:07.700
- You raped Dr. Nathan?

31:07.767 --> 31:08.767
- Yeah.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.133
- Why?

31:10.200 --> 31:11.734
- I don't know.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.934
I was in the mood.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.667
- He was in the mood.
That right?

31:15.734 --> 31:18.367
Hey, it's good to meet
you there, Keenan.

31:18.433 --> 31:20.433
You and me,
maybe we can get together

31:20.500 --> 31:23.000
and do some business sometime.
- Yeah, I'd like that,

31:23.066 --> 31:24.567
working for
the O'Reily brothers.

31:24.633 --> 31:28.166
- Okay, see you.

31:37.734 --> 31:40.367
Yeah.
- Where you goin'

31:40.433 --> 31:42.367
- Hey, Goldilocks,

31:42.433 --> 31:44.734
you wanna suck some chocolate?
- No!

31:55.467 --> 31:57.033
- Break it up!

31:57.100 --> 31:58.567
- I'll kill your ass,
motherfucker!

32:13.100 --> 32:15.166
- I'm switching him
to 1 milligram of Haldol.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.467
- Are you sure?
- Well, what do you suggest?

32:17.533 --> 32:19.533
Counseling?

32:27.000 --> 32:29.066
- What the fuck is
going on, Adebisi?

32:29.133 --> 32:30.433
Letting these assholes
fuck with my brother.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.867
We had a goddamn deal!

32:31.934 --> 32:35.000
- Relax, O'Reily,
before you blow a blood vessel.

32:35.066 --> 32:37.333
I've already spoken
to Tidd and Browne.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.300
Haven't I?
- Yeah.

32:39.367 --> 32:42.734
- Browne?
- Yeah, man.

32:44.367 --> 32:48.333
This type of bullshit
will not do again.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.967
Okay?

33:00.734 --> 33:02.533
- He all right?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.300
- They got him
so tanked up on Haldol,

33:04.367 --> 33:06.467
it's like he's
in a fucking coma.

33:06.533 --> 33:08.567
- Is that such
a bad thing?

33:13.400 --> 33:16.734
- O'Reily, I got
a question for you.

33:23.633 --> 33:25.000
Stanislofsky.

33:25.066 --> 33:27.066
Come here, sit.

33:29.266 --> 33:31.066
- I been playing catch-up

33:31.133 --> 33:32.967
on a lot of
what's been happening here.

33:33.033 --> 33:36.500
Been reading the file on
the death of one Ralph Galino.

33:36.567 --> 33:37.900
- Tragic.

33:37.967 --> 33:39.767
Drugs very
serious problem.

33:39.834 --> 33:40.967
- Yeah.

33:41.033 --> 33:42.667
Except he had
no history of drugs,

33:42.734 --> 33:44.867
so, how does he die
of an OD?

33:44.934 --> 33:46.467
- A mystery.

33:46.533 --> 33:48.734
- I understand you and Galino
didn't get along.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.834
- Who says that?

33:50.900 --> 33:52.567
- Did you ask me
a question?

33:52.633 --> 33:54.967
'Cause you don't get
to ask me questions.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.033
You are my main suspect
in Galino's death.

33:58.100 --> 34:00.333
You are my only suspect.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.000
I'm gonna be watching you,

34:02.066 --> 34:06.166
perched like
a czarist eagle.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.333
- You said we should wait.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.900
So, we wait,
and look what happens.

34:23.967 --> 34:25.600
O'Reily goes to the hacks
and tells them

34:25.667 --> 34:27.900
you and I killed Galino.
- O'Reily said that?

34:27.967 --> 34:31.066
You and me?
- Yes, so take care of him.

34:31.133 --> 34:34.300
- You whack O'Reily now, they'll
have all the proof they need.

34:34.367 --> 34:36.000
No thanks,
I got a birthday coming up.

34:36.066 --> 34:38.400
I don't wanna spend it
in solitary.

34:45.233 --> 34:47.266
- Look,
I know that Russian cocksucker's

34:47.333 --> 34:48.934
been talking smack about me,
Jaz,

34:49.000 --> 34:51.567
but you can't trust
that motherfucker.

34:51.633 --> 34:52.867
- I don't trust him.

34:52.934 --> 34:54.934
I don't trust you neither.
- Okay, fine.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.900
Only he's supposed
to be your pal, right?

34:56.967 --> 35:00.500
I'll bet he hasn't told you
about the cell phone.

35:00.567 --> 35:02.767
- Cell phone?
What cell phone?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.200
- Ralph Galino's
cell phone.

35:04.266 --> 35:05.767
That's why he killed that wop.
- Shit.

35:05.834 --> 35:08.166
- Now, who do you trust?

35:08.233 --> 35:12.100
- What's going on?

35:12.166 --> 35:14.300
Droog, what is problem?

35:16.100 --> 35:19.033
- Cut the shit.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.200
Give me the cell phone.

35:21.266 --> 35:24.033
Give it to me.

35:28.633 --> 35:31.600
- So, what is going
to happen to me now?

35:31.667 --> 35:33.633
- Thinking, uh...

35:33.700 --> 35:34.834
maybe you die.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.633
- Ah.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.767
- Guards! Guards!
- Break it up!

35:41.834 --> 35:43.433
Break it up!
Get against the wall.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.400
Get on back there!
- Easy, guys.

35:45.467 --> 35:48.734
- Come on,
get off or you're all in.

35:48.800 --> 35:51.433
- Everybody's always looking
for an excuse.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.000
I killed that man 'cause:

35:53.066 --> 35:55.633
"A", I was abused as a child;

35:55.700 --> 35:57.900
B, I had shitty parents;

35:57.967 --> 36:00.533
C, I was raised in poverty;

36:00.600 --> 36:02.834
D, all of the above.

36:02.900 --> 36:07.033
If the only thing you know from
the cradle on up is violence...

36:07.100 --> 36:10.233
What other choice have you got?
- Fuck!

36:10.300 --> 36:12.300
Nyet!

36:12.367 --> 36:13.867
- What other reason
do you need?

36:39.734 --> 36:41.667
- Morning, Bob.

36:44.667 --> 36:48.767
Bob, please, when are you gonna
stop this silent treatment?

36:48.834 --> 36:51.000
I said I'm sorry

36:51.066 --> 36:53.367
that I didn't tell you
I was building a new tunnel,

36:53.433 --> 36:54.867
that I didn't ask you
to escape with me.

36:54.934 --> 36:57.400
What more can I do?

36:59.567 --> 37:01.500
- Count.

37:06.567 --> 37:07.900
- How is he?
- Not good.

37:07.967 --> 37:10.834
- 8-8-K-2-1-4,
7-7-P-3-2-6,

37:10.900 --> 37:14.633
9-8-K-5-1-4,
9-7-B-4-1-2.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.834
Hey, Beecher,
get your ass out here.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.033
- Leave him alone.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.066
- Beecher, now.
- You can see he's there.

37:26.133 --> 37:29.266
Why does he have
to stand in line?

37:29.333 --> 37:32.233
- Rules is rules.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.166
- Fuck you.

37:34.233 --> 37:35.433
- What?

37:35.500 --> 37:38.300
- Fuck you,
fuck your rules!

37:38.367 --> 37:41.834
- Rebadow, I'd expect Keller
to be mouthy, but not you.

37:41.900 --> 37:44.567
- The man's children
have been kidnapped;

37:44.633 --> 37:46.133
his son's hand cut off.

37:46.200 --> 37:49.033
Beecher's obviously in pain!
Why torture him more?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.467
- Right.
both: Yeah.

37:51.533 --> 37:52.834
- Keep going.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.066
- 9-6-G-4-1-5...

37:55.133 --> 37:57.767
- All right, quiet down!
Quiet down now!

37:57.834 --> 38:00.500
- Who knew you had balls.

38:02.767 --> 38:04.633
- Shut the fuck up!

38:06.734 --> 38:08.133
- A few years ago,
I was attacked

38:08.200 --> 38:11.633
by some of the black boys
and landed in the hospital.

38:11.700 --> 38:13.233
- I remember.

38:13.300 --> 38:15.767
- The bruises healed,
but...

38:15.834 --> 38:17.934
I was flooded with fear.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.133
- Well, that's natural.

38:20.200 --> 38:23.166
- I hadn't felt such fear
since I was about to be executed

38:23.233 --> 38:25.333
and then wasn't.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.233
Killing Raoul Hernandez, as...

38:28.300 --> 38:30.567
as terrible as it was,

38:30.633 --> 38:32.367
as--

38:32.433 --> 38:34.667
I don't know,
I feel alive.

38:38.633 --> 38:40.333
I'm not afraid to die.

38:59.367 --> 39:01.467
- Teach me.

39:01.533 --> 39:03.166
- Teach you what?

39:03.233 --> 39:05.300
- How to box.

39:05.367 --> 39:06.500
You gotta be
kidding me, right?

39:06.567 --> 39:08.767
- I wanna learn
to defend myself.

39:08.834 --> 39:10.967
- Rebadow, I ain't got the time
or the interest.

39:11.033 --> 39:12.633
Take off.

39:12.700 --> 39:14.533
- I can teach you.
- Cyril.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.834
- No, I can if I want.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.066
Okay.

39:22.133 --> 39:25.000
First, you gotta learn
how to stand.

39:25.066 --> 39:27.166
- Fucking Cyril.

39:32.967 --> 39:34.266
- Hey, Rebadow.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.333
Give me your pie, pops.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.767
- No.

39:37.834 --> 39:40.100
- Oh, you're gonna
give me your pie,

39:40.166 --> 39:43.100
or I'm gonna break
your old ass in two.

39:43.166 --> 39:45.333
- Okay.

39:56.834 --> 40:00.133
- How does it taste, man?

40:02.767 --> 40:04.834
- You missed a great lunch,
but I got you something.

40:04.900 --> 40:06.834
Here.
Psst.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.133
Toby, take it.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.867
Toby, you gotta eat something.
Take it.

40:12.467 --> 40:15.734
Take the fucking orange
and eat it, come on.

40:23.033 --> 40:26.266
- Nothing like fresh squeezed
orange juice.

40:26.333 --> 40:29.133
- Cellmates.
It's like being married.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.667
- Rebadow still ignoring you?

40:30.734 --> 40:33.800
- Worse.
He's like a different person.

40:33.867 --> 40:36.467
It's like when I was gone,
some alien took over his body.

40:36.533 --> 40:39.967
- He certainly has changed.
- It's unsettling.

40:40.033 --> 40:42.400
After a certain age,
people shouldn't change.

40:42.467 --> 40:44.900
- Shh, here he comes.

40:53.567 --> 40:54.667
- Mr. Morales...

40:54.734 --> 40:56.633
- Whoa, slow down there,
Rebadow.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.066
- I wanna talk to you.

40:58.133 --> 41:00.400
- Let him be, Chico.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.633
What do you need?

41:09.333 --> 41:12.200
- When I agreed
to kill Hernandez,

41:12.266 --> 41:14.500
you said in return
I could have anything I wanted.

41:14.567 --> 41:15.800
- True.

41:15.867 --> 41:17.300
And now you want me
to repay the debt?

41:17.367 --> 41:19.533
- Yes.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.934
- Okay.
What can I do for you?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.533
- I want you to let me
kill someone else.

41:40.400 --> 41:42.900
- Daddy!

41:47.734 --> 41:49.467
- Daddy?

41:50.567 --> 41:52.467
Daddy?

42:11.533 --> 42:13.066
- He has these dreams a lot?

42:13.133 --> 42:15.300
- Ever since his kids
got nabbed.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.166
- Well, I'll speak to him.
- Sister Peter Marie, too.

42:18.233 --> 42:20.600
Given her relationship
with Beecher,

42:20.667 --> 42:23.333
she's being rather...

42:23.400 --> 42:25.767
Casual about all this.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.533
- That's not true.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.100
- I can't help
thinking her distance

42:29.166 --> 42:30.433
has something
to do with me.

42:30.500 --> 42:33.467
- Well, shocking as
this seems, Keller,

42:33.533 --> 42:36.100
not everything on the planet
has to do with you.

42:38.133 --> 42:39.567
- Keller's right.

42:39.633 --> 42:41.333
It is about him.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.834
The doubts he put in my mind
about being a nun,

42:43.900 --> 42:45.633
my effectiveness
as a psychologist...

42:45.700 --> 42:47.367
- But, Pete,

42:47.433 --> 42:50.400
Beecher needs you.
- Ray, I know.

42:50.467 --> 42:52.533
Do you remember what I said
to you a few weeks ago

42:52.600 --> 42:54.734
about putting on a facade
so I could get through each day?

42:54.800 --> 42:58.533
- Sure.
- I am unable to comfort Tobias.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.767
I mean, I--I don't
even look him in the eye

43:00.834 --> 43:02.700
because I know that if I do,

43:02.767 --> 43:05.300
my facade will crumble.

43:05.367 --> 43:08.767
So that--that's worse than--
than no help to him.

43:17.533 --> 43:20.734
- Beecher hasn't been out
of his cell for two solid days.

43:23.166 --> 43:25.633
He just lies in his bunk,

43:25.700 --> 43:27.934
sobbing like a wuss.

43:30.567 --> 43:31.934
- Good.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.900
That's what's truly elegant
about this plan of mine.

43:34.967 --> 43:37.700
We don't physically
touch Beecher,

43:37.767 --> 43:41.033
and yet the damage done
is far more hideous.

43:42.433 --> 43:45.567
Time to put parts
three and four into motion.

43:50.467 --> 43:52.767
Hank?
Yeah.

43:52.834 --> 43:55.367
Want you to drop off
the other package.

43:55.433 --> 43:58.433
Right,
where we talked about.

43:58.500 --> 44:01.066
Bye.

44:03.066 --> 44:04.800
- You should
stop smoking, Father.

44:04.867 --> 44:07.000
- I know, I know,
it's bad for my health.

44:07.066 --> 44:10.300
- There's a law about smoking
in public places

44:10.367 --> 44:11.900
in state-owned buildings.

44:11.967 --> 44:13.767
- Is this bothering you?
- Yes!

44:17.200 --> 44:19.367
- Hello, Tobias.

44:19.433 --> 44:21.667
Thank you, officer.
Wait outside, please.

44:22.567 --> 44:24.667
- Take a seat, Toby.

44:24.734 --> 44:27.467
- I know what this
is about, Dad.

44:27.533 --> 44:29.133
The FBI found Gary?

44:29.200 --> 44:30.767
- Yes.

44:30.834 --> 44:33.100
- Gary's body.
He's dead.

44:34.333 --> 44:37.233
- Yes.
- I knew.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.166
I knew when I heard
about the hand.

44:42.233 --> 44:45.100
And Holly?

44:45.166 --> 44:48.066
Any news?
- No, no, not yet.

44:48.934 --> 44:51.200
I'd like to go
to Gary's funeral.

44:51.266 --> 44:52.800
- We've already
made arrangements.

44:52.867 --> 44:54.734
- I want him buried
right next to his mother.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.967
I wanna see
the graves I've dug

44:56.033 --> 44:57.367
lined up one next to the other.

44:57.433 --> 44:59.367
- Oh, son, son.

45:08.233 --> 45:11.066
- It's funny,
I can't cry.

45:13.300 --> 45:15.967
I don't have
anymore tears left.

45:34.166 --> 45:35.200
- Chris, I wanna
ask you something,

45:38.967 --> 45:40.500
and I...

45:40.567 --> 45:41.767
I probably
haven't asked you

45:41.834 --> 45:43.867
'cause I didn't wanna
know the answer.

45:43.934 --> 45:46.000
I know you were married
all those times,

45:46.066 --> 45:48.333
and I'm wondering
if I was the first,

45:48.400 --> 45:50.066
you know,
the first man.

45:53.567 --> 45:55.433
- Well, I guess that
answers my question.

45:55.500 --> 45:57.166
- No, no, it doesn't.

45:57.233 --> 45:59.433
I just, uh...

45:59.500 --> 46:01.600
think it's an odd conversation
for us to be having

46:01.667 --> 46:04.200
right before you go
to your son's funeral.

46:05.300 --> 46:06.800
The FBI says
you're responsible

46:06.867 --> 46:08.567
for a series
of homosexual murders.

46:08.633 --> 46:10.800
- The FBI...
- I'm not asking you to tell me

46:10.867 --> 46:12.667
if you committed the murders.

46:12.734 --> 46:16.200
I'm asking you if you've ever
felt this way with another man.

46:16.266 --> 46:18.066
- No.

46:19.367 --> 46:21.500
I have not felt this way.

46:23.667 --> 46:26.000
I swear, Toby.

46:26.066 --> 46:27.834
- You're lying.

46:27.900 --> 46:29.700
- Toby, I'm not--

46:29.767 --> 46:30.867
- You're lying.

47:04.033 --> 47:06.600
Sweet dreams, baby.

47:23.266 --> 47:25.367
- Yes.

47:25.433 --> 47:28.300
Ah, come in, sit.

47:28.367 --> 47:30.367
Thanks, officer.

47:30.433 --> 47:31.800
Smoke?

47:31.867 --> 47:34.333
- They're bad for you.

47:37.734 --> 47:40.266
- Shirley Bellinger,
before she was executed,

47:40.333 --> 47:42.500
gave me a little hint
as to who impregnated her

47:42.567 --> 47:43.834
when she was in Oz.

47:43.900 --> 47:46.367
She said,
"neither rain nor snow,"

47:46.433 --> 47:48.166
which I believe is
part of the old motto

47:48.233 --> 47:50.533
of the U.S. Postal Service.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.567
Since you deliver the mail
to death row,

47:52.633 --> 47:55.100
I'm thinking she was telling
me that you were the father.

47:55.166 --> 47:57.100
- Well, you're wrong.

47:57.166 --> 48:00.333
I never had
sex with Shirley.

48:00.400 --> 48:03.633
Not that I didn't want to.

48:03.700 --> 48:05.467
Even if you had been right,
what's it matter?

48:05.533 --> 48:07.233
She's dead.

48:07.300 --> 48:10.333
- I don't know you,
Schillinger.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.066
I don't know what
you're capable of.

48:12.133 --> 48:15.533
I know your reputation,
of course.

48:15.600 --> 48:17.734
But even so,
I find it hard to believe

48:17.800 --> 48:20.867
that you would cut the hand
off a small child.

48:20.934 --> 48:23.734
That you would kill
a boy who never

48:23.800 --> 48:25.600
hurt a soul.

48:25.667 --> 48:29.367
- I never did anything
to Beecher's kid.

48:29.433 --> 48:32.700
- I'm gonna tell
you something now.

48:32.767 --> 48:35.834
Beecher is the one
who found your son, Hank.

48:35.900 --> 48:37.533
- I know.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.567
- You know.

48:39.633 --> 48:40.967
- Yeah,
he did it to fuck with me

48:41.033 --> 48:44.000
the same way he did with Andrew.
- No.

48:44.066 --> 48:47.767
He did it to make up
for what happened to Andrew.

48:47.834 --> 48:49.900
He did it in the hopes
of putting the anger

48:49.967 --> 48:51.533
that exists between you
behind you.

48:51.600 --> 48:54.166
This I swear to you
on my vow as a priest.

48:54.233 --> 48:58.166
If I'm lying to you,
may I be damned for all time.

49:02.066 --> 49:04.333
Schillinger,
don't let anything happen

49:04.400 --> 49:07.533
to Beecher's daughter.

49:07.600 --> 49:11.166
If you have any decency
left inside you,

49:11.233 --> 49:13.433
if you...

49:13.500 --> 49:16.533
if you have a soul...

49:17.600 --> 49:20.066
You'll let that girl go free.

49:35.066 --> 49:37.266
- All right, so, you asked me
to do a little digging, right?

49:37.333 --> 49:39.266
So, I dug here, nothing.

49:39.333 --> 49:41.000
I dug there, zip.

49:41.066 --> 49:43.800
But then, a gusher.

49:43.867 --> 49:45.800
Tell me.
- Tell me.

49:45.867 --> 49:47.800
I got valuable information

49:47.867 --> 49:49.900
and we haven't even
negotiated a price.

49:49.967 --> 49:51.200
- How much?

49:51.266 --> 49:53.233
- Hey, I got kids, too,
all right?

49:53.300 --> 49:54.867
My youngest, Tabitha,

49:54.934 --> 49:57.066
she needs massive
amounts of dental work.

49:57.133 --> 49:59.433
That poor girl's teeth
are fucked up, man.

49:59.500 --> 50:00.633
They're all rotted out.
- Save it.

50:00.700 --> 50:02.100
- Please, not now.

50:02.166 --> 50:05.433
- All right,
but you pay the dental bills,

50:05.500 --> 50:06.900
every last one of them.

50:06.967 --> 50:08.834
- Okay.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.800
Just tell me what you know
about the kidnapping.

50:15.333 --> 50:19.500
According to a very reliable
source on the outside,

50:19.567 --> 50:21.266
this was a job for hire.

50:21.333 --> 50:23.500
The actual perp's name

50:23.567 --> 50:25.967
is Bob "Big Butt" Tolan.

50:26.033 --> 50:28.433
- Who hired him?

50:28.500 --> 50:30.233
- I hesitate.

50:30.300 --> 50:32.700
- Why?

50:32.767 --> 50:35.500
- Because it's
someone I understand

50:35.567 --> 50:37.734
is very near and dear to you.

50:37.800 --> 50:40.333
- Who, for Christ sake?

50:40.400 --> 50:41.967
- Chris Keller.

50:43.767 --> 50:45.300
- Can you be
sure of this?

50:45.367 --> 50:48.400
- I'm as sure as anybody
can be about anything.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.600
- I need you to find
out the truth.

51:05.667 --> 51:07.467
- That's my job.

51:07.533 --> 51:09.133
- He's done a lot
of fucked up things to me,

51:09.200 --> 51:12.266
but this makes no sense.

51:12.333 --> 51:14.333
- Guys like Keller
are hunters.

51:16.300 --> 51:17.834
They kill for sport.

51:26.633 --> 51:28.600
- You think you're
a pretty cool customer, huh?

51:28.667 --> 51:30.467
- Well...

51:30.533 --> 51:33.367
Let's just say I spent my share
of time in interrogations.

51:36.834 --> 51:40.433
- You ever hear of a fellow
by the name of Mark Carocci?

51:41.667 --> 51:44.700
No.

51:44.767 --> 51:46.767
- Byam Lewis?
- Nope.

51:46.834 --> 51:50.567
How about Bryce Tibbetts?
- No, no, and no.

51:50.633 --> 51:52.700
- All three of these men
were homosexuals.

51:52.767 --> 51:55.467
All three hung out
in the same gay bar.

51:55.533 --> 51:57.500
All three turned up dead.

51:57.567 --> 51:59.967
That is after they were
sodomized and tortured.

52:00.033 --> 52:01.100
- Yeah?

52:01.166 --> 52:02.934
- Yeah.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.133
But here's what's curious.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.367
You moved to the city
in December of '97.

52:08.433 --> 52:09.600
These men were killed

52:09.667 --> 52:12.934
in January, March,
and May of '98.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.100
You got sent to Oz
in June of that year.

52:16.166 --> 52:18.800
Suddenly,
the killings stopped.

52:18.867 --> 52:21.500
- What a bizarre coincidence.

52:30.066 --> 52:31.333
- We know you're guilty.

52:32.834 --> 52:35.133
You got proof?

52:35.200 --> 52:36.633
Evidence,
witnesses?

52:36.700 --> 52:38.266
- You frequented
the same gay bar.

52:39.834 --> 52:42.734
Ah, well, you know,
that doesn't make me a murderer

52:42.800 --> 52:44.266
anymore than it
makes me a fag.

52:44.333 --> 52:45.867
- And yet you are,
aren't you?

52:45.934 --> 52:48.266
A fag?

52:48.333 --> 52:49.800
- You suck
Tobias Beecher's cock.

52:49.867 --> 52:51.133
- He sucks mine.

52:51.200 --> 52:52.667
- From what I hear,
you and he have had

52:52.734 --> 52:54.333
a pretty bumpy
courtship, huh?

52:54.400 --> 52:56.467
Lots of pain inflicted
on both sides.

52:56.533 --> 52:58.367
You in on this latest round?

53:01.567 --> 53:03.200
- I don't follow you.

53:03.266 --> 53:04.700
- The death of his son.

53:04.767 --> 53:08.000
- Me kill his son?
You're joking, right?

53:08.066 --> 53:11.867
- Now, when have you ever
known the FBI to joke?

53:13.600 --> 53:15.600
- Lights out!

53:21.800 --> 53:23.867
- How you doing?

53:23.934 --> 53:26.000
You been very quiet today.

53:30.500 --> 53:33.667
- Let me ask you something.

53:33.734 --> 53:37.367
What should I do if I ever
find out who killed Gary?

53:37.433 --> 53:40.166
- You should whack him.

53:40.233 --> 53:41.800
I'd help you.

53:41.867 --> 53:44.100
- Yeah?
- Be my pleasure.

53:44.166 --> 53:45.700
What the fuck!

53:45.767 --> 53:48.367
Ah!
- You murdered my son!

53:54.967 --> 53:57.133
- Get the fuck off him!

53:57.200 --> 53:58.533
- You think I'd do that?

53:58.600 --> 54:00.667
- You're capable
of fucking anything!

54:10.834 --> 54:12.900
- You bitch!

54:21.100 --> 54:22.600
- I'm here for my money.

54:22.667 --> 54:25.367
- Pay him.

54:25.433 --> 54:26.934
- You really got a kid
with rotten teeth?

54:27.000 --> 54:29.400
- Yeah.
You should see her mouth, man.

54:29.467 --> 54:31.600
Nothing but decay.

54:31.667 --> 54:35.333
- Genetics?

54:35.400 --> 54:37.700
Or environment?

54:37.767 --> 54:39.300
Like in everything else,

54:39.367 --> 54:42.734
society searches
for the magic bullet,

54:42.800 --> 54:44.467
the easy answer.

54:44.533 --> 54:46.100
'cause the more complex
the answer is,

54:46.166 --> 54:49.367
the more terrified
we become.

54:49.433 --> 54:52.533
Is the root of violence
much deeper,

54:52.600 --> 54:54.667
much darker?

54:54.734 --> 54:57.667
How about pure evil?

55:00.166 --> 55:03.133
Maybe we human creatures
are inherently evil.

55:03.200 --> 55:05.433
Maybe evil is ingrained,

55:05.500 --> 55:09.033
embedded in our souls.

55:09.100 --> 55:10.700
Flip Wilson used to joke,

55:10.767 --> 55:13.700
"The devil made me do it."

55:13.767 --> 55:16.400
Maybe he was right.

55:16.467 --> 55:19.066
Or maybe not.

55:22.367 --> 55:24.233
- Hello, Hank?

55:24.300 --> 55:26.166
Yeah.

55:26.233 --> 55:27.600
Want you to drop off
the other package

55:27.667 --> 55:29.567
at the grandparents' house.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.300
No.

55:33.367 --> 55:34.667
Alive.
