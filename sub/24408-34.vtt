Hon, you got a good heart.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
You want to help those bugs?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Let 'em be bugs.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
And besides, they're not constituents,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
they're "constitu-ants"!

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
That was a good one.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Hey, Duane, come walk your mama to the car!

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I got a knee slapper that'll really get ya!

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Duane: Oh, I got to hear this!

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
But, Craig, what about the bugs?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Bug City was never really for the bugs.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
It was for me.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
They don't need it, and neither do I.
