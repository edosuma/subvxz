WEBVTT

01:37.848 --> 01:40.226
- <i>People are dying!</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

01:40.226 --> 01:42.186
Let's all
just calm down, all right?

01:42.186 --> 01:45.523
- How are we supposed to keep
our young men safe?
- Get a gun.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.942
We all just need to listen
to Chief Kalei.

01:47.942 --> 01:50.277
She couldn't even save
her own incel officer.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.113
May he rest in peace.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.949
- Looks like your dad's
got this handled.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.367
- Yeah. Your mom
knows what's up, too.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.952
Sup, Riley?

01:57.952 --> 02:00.454
Hey, Mr. Davenport.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.796
Need anything? Roxy? Xanny?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.256
I'm good.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.383
Are you good?

02:12.383 --> 02:14.510
'Cause you don't seem good.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.345
It's hard to be good the day
after your sister's funeral

02:16.345 --> 02:18.472
where a bunch of people
got merc'd.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.308
YOLO. Am I right, girls?

02:22.309 --> 02:25.187
- Okay, everyone,
quiet the heck down!

02:25.187 --> 02:27.147
Thank you, Officer Kalama.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.651
Now, along with following up
with Officer Cruise's inquiries,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.236
I've also requested

02:32.236 --> 02:33.737
additional resources
from the state,

02:33.737 --> 02:36.866
and I've asked Dr. Gilbert
to assist our M.E.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.617
as a liaison with the mainland.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.997
I've contacted my medical school
colleagues in Boston

02:42.997 --> 02:44.415
who've promised
to expedite things

02:44.415 --> 02:45.916
and use their discretion.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.418
Do you ever think about

02:47.418 --> 02:49.378
turning in those texts
to the police?

02:49.378 --> 02:51.297
I-I mean, like,
like, anonymously.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.299
- Anonymously?
- Yeah.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.718
Yeah, that's not a
real thing. So see you in jail,

02:55.718 --> 02:58.387
unless you think your dad's dick
is some kind of power tool.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.598
Wh-What is that
supposed to mean?

03:00.598 --> 03:04.059
My mom's been bitching
about cleaning up their mess.

03:05.060 --> 03:07.104
- It's the cult!
- Okay. Okay,

03:07.104 --> 03:09.690
Mom, that was 25 years ago,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.317
and it was a mass suicide.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.360
They almost destroyed us.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.280
I just want you to know
that I'm totally not into Dylan.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.325
Cool. Me, either.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.285
I mean, that sex tape?

03:21.285 --> 03:23.871
Looks like
I legit dodged a bullet.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.331
Yeah.

03:25.331 --> 03:27.791
We'll be questioning
everyone who was at the funeral

03:27.791 --> 03:30.169
or had any ties
to any of the victims.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.754
This is a small town.

03:31.754 --> 03:34.006
Someone must have
seen something.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.597
What's so funny?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.725
Um, nothing.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.977
Who are you texting?

04:27.977 --> 04:29.770
Um...

04:29.770 --> 04:31.563
Just Margot.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.566
It kind of seems like you two
are getting pretty close.

04:36.694 --> 04:39.405
She's my best friend, remember?

04:39.405 --> 04:41.031
- Come on, Alison.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.658
It's graduation night.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.951
Don't you want to have fun
with your friends?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.536
These aren't my friends.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.746
They could be,
if you put in a little effort.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.416
You mean, to be totally fake?

04:50.416 --> 04:52.501
Come on, Alison.
Don't do this tonight.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.461
At least pretend
to have a good time.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.672
- I don't do pretend.
- I'm aware.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.382
- Bruce! Come on in.

04:59.425 --> 05:01.218
- Hey.
- Welcome.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.012
Thank you.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.860
Just be careful, okay?

05:17.860 --> 05:20.612
With what,
texting while you're driving?

05:20.612 --> 05:23.032
With Margot.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.368
She and your sister
were really close.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.995
You're...

05:27.995 --> 05:29.371
different.

05:30.414 --> 05:34.209
Meaning not as smart
or good or fun.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.836
Meaning not as superficial.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.797
You are unbelievable.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.215
You make me come home
for the summer.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.009
You tell me
I have to act like Lennon.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.093
And then
when I finally get close

05:43.093 --> 05:44.219
to the people
she was closest to,

05:44.219 --> 05:45.596
you tell me to stop?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.389
What, that-that you want me
to be fake and alone

05:47.389 --> 05:48.557
for the rest of my life?

05:48.557 --> 05:49.641
Margot didn't love you.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.813
She loved your sister.

06:50.119 --> 06:51.745
That won't save you.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.664
Fuck.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.465
What the fuck?

07:03.465 --> 07:05.551
I know you.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.637
- Moon Waves. My mom.
- No.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.639
No, from last time.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.941
There is no redemption
in this life.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.942
Yeah?

08:03.942 --> 08:06.695
Hi, Courtney.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.907
Is Riley home?

08:09.907 --> 08:11.783
Does your mom need
a new cleaning lady?

08:11.783 --> 08:13.827
That dick Bruce furrowed me.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.080
- Like it's my fault those guys
bled out in his bathroom.
- No.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.874
Yeah, totally.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.585
We already have
a live-in housekeeper.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.506
Riley. Princess Margot's here.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.763
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.183
Oh, do you-do you
want to come in?

08:38.352 --> 08:40.938
Okay, this is the one.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.358
Nice.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.859
You want to borrow something?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.736
Little more innocent-looking?

08:47.736 --> 08:50.072
I mean, police are very visual.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.115
It's okay. I'm cool.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.076
I hope the others are.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.036
I know Dylan's been
a little intense lately,

08:56.036 --> 08:57.579
- but no way he's a narc.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.957
I'm not worried about poor,
sensitive, spectrum boy.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.501
Lennon was supposed to be here
an hour ago,

09:02.501 --> 09:04.503
and now she's ghosting me.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.255
That's just Lennon being Lennon.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.673
Tea.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.050
She can be very inconsiderate.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.803
I mean,
like when she fucked Dylan.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.474
How about that time
she ratted me out

09:17.474 --> 09:19.643
to skeevy Mr. Posner
in seventh grade

09:19.643 --> 09:21.144
for some extra credit.

09:22.145 --> 09:25.607
It just feels different
since she got home.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.943
- Don't you think?
- Maybe.

09:28.986 --> 09:32.406
I mean,
she hasn't picked up from me,

09:32.406 --> 09:35.575
and she's only made one comment
about my tits.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.994
They are perfection.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.080
Sure you can buy some.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.583
No one would be more screwed
than Lennon

09:43.583 --> 09:45.335
- if the police found out.
- Facts.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.046
I told her her dad's dick
couldn't even save her.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.216
You saw Bruce's dick?

09:51.216 --> 09:53.802
No. He's fucking
that ratch police chick.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.095
My mom said they left used toys

09:55.095 --> 09:56.972
and tons of lube
all over the lodge.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.558
Bruce is a bend-over boyfriend?

09:59.558 --> 10:02.728
That would be high-key hot
if it wasn't with that dry vag.

10:04.438 --> 10:08.275
Look, I know Lennon's a cunt,
but she's still my BFF.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.528
I just hope she remembers that
when the police start probing.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.200
Dylan.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.910
Hey.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.829
- Hey.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.539
Everything okay?

10:28.837 --> 10:30.839
Okay.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.218
I really miss Alison.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.262
A lot.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.976
Yeah, me too.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.145
<i>To our amazing kids</i>

10:45.145 --> 10:48.273
and us-- the awesome parents
who made them.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.858
First do no harm, right?

10:49.858 --> 10:51.777
Come on,
valedictorian Dad.

10:51.777 --> 10:55.155
I can't believe she chose
your alma mater over mine.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.491
Michigan offered her
a full ride.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.911
I'm just really proud of her.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.871
And your other one?

11:02.871 --> 11:05.123
- What's her name again?
- Alison.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.876
She, uh... She'll find her way.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.503
Speak of the devil.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.588
That's me. The devil.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.049
Hey, kiddo.
You put on makeup. Looks great.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.051
I want to go home.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.011
We just got here.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.263
- It's my first Kona.
- Second.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.932
Why don't you go hang out
with your friends?

11:21.932 --> 11:23.558
I don't-I don't
have any friends.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.185
Very funny.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.521
- Uh... where's your sister?
- I don't give a shit.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.731
- I just want to go.
- Okay, well,
I'm not leaving right now,

11:29.731 --> 11:31.400
so go have fun with...

11:31.400 --> 11:33.235
someone.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.159
- It's a tough time
for them, you know?

11:41.159 --> 11:42.702
Finishing high school.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.538
Yeah.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.082
To our kids
and how much we love them.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.962
Who the fuck are you,
Fred Phillips?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.775
Fuck.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.988
Yeah. What?

12:17.988 --> 12:19.698
<i>Someone needs a Xanny.</i>

12:19.698 --> 12:21.783
<i>Riley told me</i>
<i>you were stressing.</i>

12:21.783 --> 12:23.493
<i>Why are you and Riley</i>
<i>talking about me?</i>

12:23.493 --> 12:24.953
Paranoid much?

12:24.953 --> 12:26.538
<i>We're concerned.</i>

12:26.538 --> 12:29.416
<i>It's interrogation day, and you</i>
<i>were supposed to come prep.</i>

12:29.416 --> 12:33.044
Shit. Fuck.
Sorry, um, I totally spaced.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.463
I just, uh...

12:34.463 --> 12:37.215
- I-I won't say anything, okay?
<i>- No, wait.</i>

12:53.482 --> 12:56.693
- Are you fucking kidding me?

12:57.736 --> 13:00.030
What-what are you doing here?

13:00.030 --> 13:01.698
I was in the cave.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.408
You know what, forget it.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.912
I can't take any more
of your sad, guilt-trippy vibe.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.290
I was trying to take your advice
and move forward

13:10.290 --> 13:11.958
and Clara Whethers came at me
with a big-ass knife

13:11.958 --> 13:13.668
- and there was blood
all over the place.
- What?

13:13.668 --> 13:15.712
- Whose blood?
- I don't know.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.340
But, um, I've been going over
the whole thing,

13:18.340 --> 13:20.258
and I think
that she might be the killer.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.011
Um, I mean,
she's a fucking freak,

13:23.011 --> 13:24.471
but why would she kill everyone?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.223
Remember that night
when we left Alison?

13:26.223 --> 13:27.599
- Like I could forget it.
- All right, okay,

13:27.599 --> 13:29.935
well... I heard something.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.895
Riley and Margot
said it was rats,

13:31.895 --> 13:33.813
but where I heard that noise,

13:33.813 --> 13:36.358
that's where Clara
came from today.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.652
So you think
she saw us that night?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.403
She said she knew me
from last time

13:40.403 --> 13:42.280
and there was no redemption.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.742
Fuck. I mean,
I heard those cult people

13:45.742 --> 13:47.702
killed animals and shit.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.204
If she was there,
she could have Alison's phone.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.248
And she was at the funeral
when Harold

13:51.248 --> 13:52.666
and that police officer
got killed.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.086
And she drives a black truck.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.005
She was just waiting
for us to get home

13:59.005 --> 14:00.340
so she could punish us.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.467
Well, d-do you think
we should call the police?

14:02.467 --> 14:03.802
We need proof.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.303
Unless we want to tell them

14:05.303 --> 14:06.972
what we did that night.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.100
I don't want you
to get in trouble.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.520
Thanks.

14:27.284 --> 14:30.287
Why was Clara Whethers
at the funeral?

14:30.287 --> 14:32.289
Clara?

14:32.289 --> 14:35.709
Yeah. Did you invite her?

14:35.709 --> 14:38.628
'Cause, I mean,
it's not like she knew me.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.839
Sure she was
just paying her respects.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.508
Both our families
have been in Wai Huna forever.

14:45.135 --> 14:48.388
You mean her-her cult family
that died?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.433
That's why she wears those
ugly-ass green dresses, right?

14:51.433 --> 14:54.811
Listen,
Clara's got her own beliefs.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.773
Like what?

14:58.773 --> 15:00.358
I don't know.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.738
And now's not the time
to worry about it.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.907
I can't believe your girlfriend
won't give us a pass.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.659
Lyla's just doing her job.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.329
- Yeah, and being annoying.
- Just remember,

15:12.329 --> 15:15.749
it got nothing to do
with last summer.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.751
Okay?

15:17.751 --> 15:20.295
You got nothing to hide.

15:20.295 --> 15:23.298
You mean
besides my very existence?

15:27.093 --> 15:28.553
<i>No, ma'am.</i>

15:28.553 --> 15:31.598
I did not see Officer Cruise
arrive at the funeral.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.767
I saw blood and I screamed.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.018
You were there, remember?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.728
<i>I did not see anybody</i>

15:36.728 --> 15:38.855
on the way
to the men's room, no.

15:38.855 --> 15:42.067
I wasn't really paying attention
to who arrived.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.277
- It was my sister's funeral.
- Of course.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.237
<i>You buy anything</i>
<i>from Dale?</i>

15:46.237 --> 15:48.114
Oh, I would never
pay Dale for anything.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.908
Just snacks and slushies.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.368
I told Officer Cruise
when he called

15:51.368 --> 15:53.078
that I never bought drugs
from Dale.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.081
<i>Did your daughter</i>
<i>Alison</i>

15:56.081 --> 15:58.333
have a sexual relationship
with Dale?

15:58.333 --> 16:00.251
Not that I'm aware of.

16:00.251 --> 16:03.755
I don't think Alison had a
sexual relationship with anyone.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.840
Were you in
a sexual relationship with Dale?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.634
- That's gross.
<i>- Dale?</i>

16:07.634 --> 16:08.843
That douchebag
would've been lucky

16:08.843 --> 16:10.428
to put his cock in my mouth.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.680
That's disgusting.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.931
<i>Sex with</i>

16:12.931 --> 16:14.516
Dale? Ew. N-No.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.184
What about your sister?

16:16.184 --> 16:18.186
- What about her?
<i>- What about</i>

16:18.186 --> 16:19.187
her OnlyFans account?

16:21.189 --> 16:22.982
Did you know that she had
an OnlyFans account?

16:24.025 --> 16:25.777
What's OnlyFans?

16:25.777 --> 16:28.405
It's a site where people pay
for personalized pornography.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.535
Alison was doing that?

16:33.535 --> 16:35.787
Officer Cruise--
may he rest in peace--

16:35.787 --> 16:38.331
discovered her account
under the nickname AllyWally.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.750
Dale was a monthly subscriber.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.463
<i>So what if my sister</i>

16:45.463 --> 16:47.966
had a porn site? What does that
have to do with the dead people?

16:47.966 --> 16:51.428
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.512
- Hmm.
- <i>Oh,</i>

16:52.512 --> 16:54.013
I wasn't friends with Alison.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.932
Why would I follow her?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.270
I get my porn for free.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.647
So I won't find Dylan Scanlon

17:02.647 --> 17:05.150
on her list of subscribers?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.903
No, ma'am.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.281
How about her passwords?
I know you two

17:11.281 --> 17:13.241
were close. Did she share
any of those with you?

17:13.241 --> 17:15.910
My sister
didn't share very much.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.496
Why the fuck would I have access
to their computers? I clean.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.374
You're the one with the access.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.211
I didn't have any parental
spyware on their devices.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.671
You know, I trusted my girls.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.799
So you don't have access
to any of Alison's accounts?

17:29.799 --> 17:32.093
No.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.513
Do you?

17:52.197 --> 17:54.199
- Clara
just totally side-eyed me.
- Me, too.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.409
Um, can we talk
about Officer Cameltoe?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.828
I mean, the cut of those pants
is ridiculous.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.163
Hello, Chris Christie.

18:00.163 --> 18:03.124
What was all that
about Alison's OnlyFans?

18:03.124 --> 18:04.918
Legit no idea.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.628
I mean,
who would even pay for that?

18:06.628 --> 18:08.755
Except her only fan.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.133
Fuck you.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.636
- Joking.
- Okay, well,
it's not funny.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.179
Okay, you're being super sus.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.597
No-no, I'm not.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.932
You actually kind of are.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.600
Well, I-I didn't say anything,

18:20.600 --> 18:21.851
if that's
what you're worried about.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.186
I just...

18:25.230 --> 18:27.482
Someone shut down
AllyWally's accounts.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.609
Probably the murderer. That's
who's been sending us shit.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.569
- You don't think
the police have them?
- No way.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.780
- They were fishing.
- Yeah, if they knew anything,
they'd know

18:33.780 --> 18:35.448
I'd never follow Alison.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.576
They haven't called her in yet.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.286
- We should go right now.
- Go where?

18:40.286 --> 18:42.288
- Clara's.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.627
Just give me two seconds.

18:49.671 --> 18:50.964
Hey. What's up?

18:50.964 --> 18:52.757
How'd it go?

18:52.757 --> 18:54.551
Fine. Um,

18:54.551 --> 18:57.136
- I'm gonna go
grab a ride with Dylan.
- Uh...

18:59.889 --> 19:02.141
Were you...

19:02.141 --> 19:05.562
Have you
been selling pornography?

19:05.562 --> 19:07.564
Of yourself?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.358
It was her.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.986
She was just using my name
in case she got caught.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.446
I told you you didn't know her.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.372
Blood's
pouring out of my head.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.374
Guy's pistol-whipping me

19:26.374 --> 19:28.793
while Mei's in the back
soaking her feet.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.920
- I was eight months pregnant.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.755
Mei finally comes out

19:32.755 --> 19:34.799
firing her Glock.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.467
Drops both dudes right there.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.844
I wasn't gonna let anyone

19:37.844 --> 19:39.637
hurt my baby.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.390
I'd do the same thing
for my girls.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.641
Dad?

19:43.641 --> 19:45.184
Uh, what's going on now, Alison?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.477
I'm-I'm Lennon.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.940
We need to talk.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.154
Well, like Mei said,
it's been an emotional day.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.156
Jesus. Fuck.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.454
What's going on?

20:06.122 --> 20:08.917
I'm done.
Either you tell her or I will.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.461
Why don't we talk
about this at h...

20:26.225 --> 20:29.604
Guys, didn't that haole kid
disappear here in middle school?

20:29.604 --> 20:31.522
Yeah, he got
his leg chopped off.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.733
He said he didn't remember
how it happened.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.194
You mean Fetterhoff?

20:36.194 --> 20:38.571
He had cancer.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.784
Def did not wear
the right shoes.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.668
Isn't it horror movie 101?

20:51.668 --> 20:53.544
Do not walk
into the killer's house?

20:53.544 --> 20:55.505
Guys, no one
but freaking psychos

20:55.505 --> 20:56.631
leave their doors unlocked.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.257
We leave our doors unlocked.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.968
Yeah.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.678
We do, too.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.263
Let's just get proof
and get out.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.144
So,
what are we looking for?

21:10.144 --> 21:12.605
Body parts? Skin suits?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.565
Clown paintings?

21:14.565 --> 21:17.276
More like
Alison's phone.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.156
Or anything that ties Clara
to the killings.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.659
It's actually
kind of charming in here.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.411
Hmm.

21:26.411 --> 21:29.455
Huh. I wonder

21:29.455 --> 21:32.458
if she gets her honey
from killer bees.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.386
Maybe the cult wasn't that bad.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.138
I mean, look how happy they are.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.973
Right?

21:46.973 --> 21:49.600
That's weird, though.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.728
Jesus.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.403
Fuck.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.464
It's like Chernobyl.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.466
Another
old, boring movie.

22:23.885 --> 22:25.762
Seriously, dudes?

22:25.762 --> 22:29.390
I mean, what if she has freaking
dead bodies tied up in there?

22:29.390 --> 22:31.684
Why would she tie them up
if they're already dead?

22:31.684 --> 22:34.103
- We need to look.
- We need a plan.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.940
Uh, the plan is to hurry.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.942
She won't be
at the station that long.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.778
Meet...

22:41.778 --> 22:45.198
Meet back here in an hour.

22:45.198 --> 22:48.451
Can we agree
this is a legit bad idea?

22:48.451 --> 22:51.871
We can't tell the cops
about Clara without proof.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.541
- Wh...
- Fine.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.251
Okay.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.545
Guys, seriously?

22:59.545 --> 23:03.049
This is deeply super fucked.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.134
<i>"Clara Whethers,</i>

23:05.134 --> 23:08.554
in black truck,
drove past the high school

23:08.554 --> 23:10.848
after Johnny and Coach murders."

23:10.848 --> 23:12.433
I saw you there, too.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.268
What were you doing there
in the middle of the night?

23:14.268 --> 23:17.105
Driving.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.358
Obviously.

23:20.358 --> 23:22.235
Are we done?

23:22.235 --> 23:24.237
<i>Almost.</i>

24:32.430 --> 24:34.640
Not where
you want to get your Botox.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.268
Botox is bullshit.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.187
Okay, wow.

24:39.187 --> 24:41.355
That was <i>très agressif.</i>

24:41.355 --> 24:43.566
I know you push people away
when you're stressed,

24:43.566 --> 24:46.819
- but this is way beyond
your usual schizo behavior.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.238
Okay, I'm not in the mood for
your therapy right now, Margot.

24:49.238 --> 24:52.241
Then stop acting crazy.

24:52.241 --> 24:55.328
One day you apologize
for being a bitch

24:55.328 --> 24:57.622
- and the next day
you're bitchier than ever.
- Oh.

24:57.622 --> 25:00.291
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe I'm just a bitch?

25:00.291 --> 25:02.877
Duh. Who isn't?

25:02.877 --> 25:05.296
Look, I just...

25:05.296 --> 25:07.548
I think you're freaking

25:07.548 --> 25:10.676
because you showed me
your real feelings.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.970
Or maybe
I don't have real feelings

25:12.970 --> 25:15.389
and I was just having
some fucking fun.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.386
Oh, my gosh.

25:53.386 --> 25:56.013
- You were right.
- What, about how fucking sick
this place is?

25:56.013 --> 25:58.057
About Lennon.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.475
Being super sus?

25:59.475 --> 26:01.394
I mean, yeah, I don't know.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.853
I mean,
all that shit with her sister?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.313
Maybe we're being
a little too harsh.

26:04.313 --> 26:07.358
We weren't.
She is being so extra.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.610
Like, legit psychotic right now.

26:09.610 --> 26:12.697
A-A-Avoiding eye contact
and-and...

26:12.697 --> 26:15.116
Since when does she drive
with Dylan instead of me?

26:15.116 --> 26:17.493
Okay.
You sound psychotic right now.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.370
Okay? Lennon's fine.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.956
Unlike this fucking place.

26:35.678 --> 26:37.221
Ma'am.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.724
Damn, you are quiet
for a big woman.

26:39.724 --> 26:41.767
5.11 trainers, ma'am.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.436
If you're looking
for an athletic shoe.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.855
So, basically,

26:45.855 --> 26:48.357
all we know is that Courtney
didn't blow Dale,

26:48.357 --> 26:50.276
which is definitely a lie.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.070
Yes, ma'am. And Dr. Gilbert
would like to speak to you.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.990
She got some results back
from her colleagues in Boston.

26:55.990 --> 26:59.076
Have I mentioned
how much I hate the Ivies?

26:59.076 --> 27:02.163
I hate medical examiners.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.450
- Boo!
- Aah!

28:22.701 --> 28:25.079
It's not funny.

28:25.079 --> 28:27.790
I'm sorry. Did I scare the stick
further up your ass?

28:27.790 --> 28:29.959
Just want to find what we're
looking for and get out of here.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.419
What, so you don't
have to be around me?

28:31.419 --> 28:33.003
So we don't get killed.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.631
I want to get out of here, too,

28:35.631 --> 28:38.342
but just tell me
what the fuck is going on.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.595
Nothing.

28:41.595 --> 28:42.972
You just don't get it.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.723
Don't get what?

28:44.723 --> 28:46.892
We've been best friends
our whole fucking life.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.727
Just tell me why you hate me
so we can get it over with

28:48.727 --> 28:50.771
and get back to normal.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.189
There is no normal.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.607
That's the point.

28:53.607 --> 28:55.693
So, what, that's my fault?

28:55.693 --> 28:57.695
No. It ju...

28:57.695 --> 29:01.073
It just made me realize
how different we are.

29:02.533 --> 29:05.119
Because you're a good person
and I'm not.

29:05.119 --> 29:06.912
I didn't say that.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.622
You didn't have to.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.627
We're just different.

29:16.464 --> 29:19.049
Fuck you.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.218
My lies are the only reason

29:21.218 --> 29:23.804
why you have a fucking life
right now, Dylan.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.294
Let's get out of here.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.839
I mean,
there's no proof she's a killer,

29:58.839 --> 30:00.216
and it's getting dark,
which means she's...

30:00.216 --> 30:01.884
she's gonna come home
and kill us.

30:04.762 --> 30:07.348
What the fuck
are we waiting for?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.435
Oh, shit.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.062
Is that your dad?

30:16.148 --> 30:18.609
Marrying Clara Whethers.

30:18.609 --> 30:19.860
Fuck.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.153
Pardosa arctica

30:21.153 --> 30:22.488
<i>minor.</i>

30:22.488 --> 30:24.323
And if I didn't go to Harvard?

30:24.323 --> 30:27.076
Brain-eating wolf spiders,
ma'am. Pygmies.

30:27.076 --> 30:28.577
I did a quick Google search.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.912
They're not native to Hawaii

30:29.912 --> 30:31.372
and would never survive here
in the wild.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.541
Thank you, Ulani.

30:33.541 --> 30:36.043
Were you close
with Officer Cruise?

30:36.043 --> 30:38.087
Yes, ma'am. We were affianced.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.297
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

30:40.297 --> 30:42.841
Uh, just in here for now.

30:42.841 --> 30:46.387
Though I hoped one day his heart
might not belong to another.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.763
Right.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.473
Um...

30:49.473 --> 30:50.724
Where'd the spiders come from?

30:50.724 --> 30:52.059
They thrive in the Arctic,

30:52.059 --> 30:53.686
which means
someone brought them in

30:53.686 --> 30:55.229
and has been keeping them cold.

30:55.229 --> 30:58.023
In order to put them
into Johnny's head.

31:09.285 --> 31:12.871
Please tell me
that is a very large walnut.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.708
It's a rat brain.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.710
So keto.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.630
Shit.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.727
Riley and Lennon!

31:37.354 --> 31:40.232
I'll find them.

32:22.983 --> 32:25.277
- Yo, we got to get out of here.
- Yeah, I'm-I'm
right behind you.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.696
I promise. Go.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.850
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:56.850 --> 33:00.062
- Where's Lennon?
- Huh? She said she was coming.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.231
- Shit.
- No, no. I got her,
I got her, I got her.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.732
Uh, text when you're safe, okay?

33:04.733 --> 33:06.110
Be careful!

33:06.110 --> 33:08.529
I knew you fucking cared!

34:05.544 --> 34:07.796
- Fuck!

34:07.796 --> 34:11.133
Dylan? Sorry.

34:11.133 --> 34:12.968
- Get 'em!

34:12.968 --> 34:14.678
Here.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.106
- Hey. Hey.

34:26.106 --> 34:28.442
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:28.442 --> 34:29.902
- Run!

34:29.902 --> 34:31.904
I'll distract her.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.368
Hey, Clara!

34:44.333 --> 34:46.335
- Get him!

34:54.176 --> 34:56.178
Margot?

35:33.423 --> 35:34.967
Hey, sweetheart.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.557
You okay?

35:42.599 --> 35:46.520
Uh... Yeah, um,
some animal ran out on the road,

35:46.520 --> 35:49.147
and-and I swerved and...

35:49.147 --> 35:51.525
got stuck.

35:51.525 --> 35:53.527
But...

35:53.527 --> 35:56.488
I'm worried about you.

35:57.531 --> 35:59.658
I'm okay now.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.493
I promise.

36:02.536 --> 36:05.163
Were you eating
in the bathroom again?

36:08.625 --> 36:10.127
I...

36:10.127 --> 36:12.170
Um...

36:12.170 --> 36:14.089
I thought we dealt with this
in therapy.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.347
- Honey.
- I'm sorry.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.349
It's okay.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.476
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

36:26.476 --> 36:29.897
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- I'm sorry.

36:29.897 --> 36:32.649
- We're gonna fix it.
- No, no.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.738
Just tell me what's going on.

36:37.738 --> 36:40.741
I'm right here, baby. It's okay.

36:53.795 --> 36:56.214
Hey.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.967
We talked about the smoking.

37:01.595 --> 37:04.431
We talked about a lot of things.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.855
What's going on?

37:11.855 --> 37:14.149
I'd ask you,

37:14.149 --> 37:17.069
but all you'd do is lie.

37:21.949 --> 37:23.951
You need to tell Alison
the truth.

37:23.951 --> 37:25.744
We both decided it'd be best
if she didn't know.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.664
Oh, no, you decided,
and you manipulated me into it,

37:28.664 --> 37:30.582
and now I'm losing everyone

37:30.582 --> 37:31.833
and every fucking thing
I ever cared about

37:31.833 --> 37:33.085
to protect you
and your fucking bullshit.

37:33.085 --> 37:34.503
- You're obviously drunk.
- I-I am thinking

37:34.503 --> 37:36.880
- really fucking clearly!
I'm just... I'm not
- Right.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.007
- doing it anymore.
- Well, all you're gonna do
is hurt your sister.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.092
I'm gonna hurt you.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.886
You act like you're
the best fucking dad,

37:42.886 --> 37:44.763
but you're so full of shit.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.431
We'd be better off
if we had no dad.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.601
You have no idea
what I have done to protect you.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.019
All you've done is fuck us up.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.939
We are so fucked-up
because of you!

37:55.899 --> 37:57.651
You can't speak to me that way.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.154
- No, I-I don't
want to speak to you.
- Good.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.240
Take a walk.
Get your head on straight.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.117
You are so
fucking weak and pathetic.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.035
I don't blame Mom
for doing what she did.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.203
That's enough!

38:09.246 --> 38:11.748
You think Alison hates you now?

38:11.748 --> 38:13.291
Just wait
till I tell her the truth.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.376
She's gonna hate you
even more than I do.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.044
I'll see you at home.

38:17.379 --> 38:18.630
Everyone's gonna
fucking hate you!

38:18.630 --> 38:19.965
You're gonna have no one!

38:25.846 --> 38:27.347
"Punching in a Dream"]

38:33.478 --> 38:35.605
Your sister ever find you?

38:35.605 --> 38:36.857
- It's okay.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.225
Can I-can I stay here?

39:12.225 --> 39:13.810
Come on in.

40:59.666 --> 41:01.668
He-Help.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.450
Whee!
