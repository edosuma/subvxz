WEBVTT

00:07.470 --> 00:09.090
This coffee is so good.

00:09.290 --> 00:10.820
It's got a nice body,

00:11.020 --> 00:12.930
a lot of light, biscuity
notes up front,

00:13.130 --> 00:14.090
but it fades to reveal

00:14.290 --> 00:15.590
an earthy yet creamy finish.

00:15.790 --> 00:17.880
Is it a shade-grown
single origin?

00:19.010 --> 00:21.480
It's Folgers, Dave.

00:23.050 --> 00:24.550
That was my next guess.

00:25.990 --> 00:28.040
Hey-hey.
Hey, Pops.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.280
We got a package at
our house addressed to you.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.610
Well, all right.

00:31.810 --> 00:33.480
And with a few days to spare,

00:33.680 --> 00:36.550
I finally got the perfect
present for Tina's birthday.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.750
Got to do it big
for your boo.
(chuckles)

00:38.950 --> 00:41.940
Yeah, and Dad has a bad history
with Mom's birthdays.

00:42.940 --> 00:45.020
Yep, he is 0
for all of them.
Yeah.

00:45.220 --> 00:47.530
Remember when he got her
that fancy vacuum cleaner?

00:47.730 --> 00:49.400
Oh, she was so upset.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.480
She vacuumed through
every football game that season.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.640
Well, don't forget her 40th.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.700
The cake.

00:57.900 --> 00:58.840
Mm.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.070
Was it a carrot cake?

01:00.270 --> 01:01.970
You know, vegetables
have no place in cakes.

01:02.180 --> 01:03.360
Full stop.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.480
I like zucchini bread.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.660
No!

01:08.360 --> 01:10.280
It turns out
that she was allergic.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.350
Her face swelled up
like a blowfish.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.420
That's why the next year,
I got her a car.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.040
And ran over her
foot with said car.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.860
Well, I couldn't see
over the big bow.

01:21.060 --> 01:23.050
But this year
is going to be different.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.470
I got her the most
amazing gift.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.930
A genuine Chanel jacket

01:29.130 --> 01:31.650
straight off
the runways of Paris.

01:32.660 --> 01:36.130
Look like it came straight
from the Guangdong Province.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.110
(chuckles)

01:38.310 --> 01:39.880
She's gonna love it, baby...

01:40.080 --> 01:41.010
DAVE:
Here we go.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.770
Ah, yes. Oh, no.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.020
Hey, man, that's too small.

01:48.220 --> 01:49.620
I can see that, Dave.

01:49.820 --> 01:53.990
Yeah, so I don't have to point
out that it's spelled "channel"?

01:54.190 --> 01:55.430
Uh, no.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.730
Well, looks like
your streak continues.

01:57.930 --> 01:59.080
(laughs)

02:02.420 --> 02:03.340
Hey.
CALVIN: Hey.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.840
Now, what are you boys up to?

02:05.040 --> 02:06.570
Nothing.
(laughs)

02:06.770 --> 02:08.340
Well, I hope you're
not getting me

02:08.540 --> 02:10.410
anything extravagant
for my birthday.

02:10.610 --> 02:13.510
I don't need anything.
All I need is you.

02:13.710 --> 02:15.210
Well, you know you got that.

02:15.410 --> 02:17.020
You know? But I got to do

02:17.220 --> 02:18.680
a little something
for my baby, now.

02:18.880 --> 02:21.050
Okay, I'm just saying,
when you look this good

02:21.250 --> 02:23.820
at my age, you can't ask
for anything more, right?

02:24.020 --> 02:25.320
You know what I mean?
You know that's right.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.330
You know what I mean?
Fine as hell.

02:27.530 --> 02:29.400
You do it, Mama. Okay.

02:29.600 --> 02:30.960
(Malcolm chuckles)

02:31.160 --> 02:34.080
Oh, man, she is definitely
going to want more.

02:35.650 --> 02:38.270
Luckily, we found
the perfect gift.

02:38.470 --> 02:39.810
Oh, yes, we did.

02:40.010 --> 02:41.540
The latest
in ergonomic sneakers

02:41.740 --> 02:43.580
because she's always complaining
about how her feet hurt.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.760
Well, they did get run over.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.980
Okay, how much do
you want for 'em?

02:49.180 --> 02:51.480
(chuckles)
Daddy, they're not for sale.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.790
Come on, guys.

02:52.990 --> 02:55.190
Look, I'll give
you $300 cash right now.

02:55.390 --> 02:57.520
(laughs)
No, my brother.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.860
You have got to get your own.

02:59.060 --> 02:59.890
(laughter)

03:00.090 --> 03:01.230
Watch out.

03:01.430 --> 03:03.260
Move out the way.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm,

03:03.460 --> 03:05.210
mm-hmm.
Ooh!

03:06.250 --> 03:08.200
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

03:08.400 --> 03:09.820
* Welcome to the hood. *

03:15.120 --> 03:16.960
Oh, hey, babe.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.310
What's going on?

03:20.510 --> 03:22.950
Our online fundraising
auction goes live tonight,

03:23.150 --> 03:24.580
and our donations suck.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.670
What are you talking about?
I just donated juggling lessons.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.760
Yeah.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.830
Anyway, I'm waiting
for Jerry O'Connell

03:34.030 --> 03:35.230
to walk by to pick up his kids.

03:35.430 --> 03:37.130
I'm going to "accidentally"
bump into him

03:37.330 --> 03:39.270
and get him to donate
VIP tickets to <i>The Talk.</i>

03:39.470 --> 03:42.030
Oh, finally, the day I get
to chop it up with Jerry.

03:42.230 --> 03:43.470
Ooh, there he is.

03:43.670 --> 03:44.540
He's mine. Jerry.

03:44.740 --> 03:46.440
Jerry! Ooh!
Oh!

03:46.640 --> 03:47.940
Oh...

03:48.140 --> 03:50.840
Fire! Uh, false alarm.
(chuckles)

03:51.040 --> 03:51.980
Hey.

03:52.180 --> 03:54.050
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.810
Hey, can I ask you
a quick question?

03:56.010 --> 03:57.680
No, I don't know
how I got

03:57.880 --> 03:59.400
Rebecca Romijn
to marry me.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.490
(strained laughter)

04:02.690 --> 04:05.290
That's funny.
I-I'm her husband Dave.

04:05.490 --> 04:08.040
I don't know how I got
her to marry me either.
Oh.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.960
So, anyway, our big
online fundraiser

04:12.160 --> 04:13.530
is coming up,
and I was wondering

04:13.730 --> 04:15.800
if you might be able to donate
something to auction off.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.270
Of course. I'm pretty sure

04:17.470 --> 04:20.040
I have a Kindle
that's still in the box.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.040
Brand-new.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.380
Oh, uh, yeah, thanks.

04:24.580 --> 04:27.380
I'm kidding. How many VIP
tickets to <i>The Talk</i> do you need?

04:27.580 --> 04:30.780
Oh, four. Yes.
Thank you. Thank you.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.570
Hooah.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.690
I'm sorry?

04:34.890 --> 04:35.850
No, I'm-- I just--

04:36.050 --> 04:37.060
I-I don't...
Oh.

04:37.260 --> 04:38.890
I don't mean to embarrass you,

04:39.090 --> 04:43.330
but, uh, I just-- <i>Scent of</i>
<i>a Woman</i> is my favorite movie.

04:43.530 --> 04:46.000
Me, too. But that
was Chris O'Donnell.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.750
I'm Jerry O'Connell.

04:53.820 --> 04:57.390
* *

04:58.960 --> 05:00.650
I'll take any idea you got.

05:00.850 --> 05:03.320
I am desperate to find
something special.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.250
Well, I got her
this amazing perfume

05:05.450 --> 05:07.320
I found on Oprah's
Favorite Things list.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.320
It's designed by her
personal scent sommelier.

05:10.520 --> 05:14.530
Perfect. I'll give you $300 cash
right here, right now.

05:14.730 --> 05:18.200
Calvin. Come on,
it's your wife's birthday.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.670
You've got to dig deeper.

05:19.870 --> 05:21.670
All right, $350.

05:21.870 --> 05:23.070
Calvin!

05:23.270 --> 05:25.970
Just, whenever I ask
her what she wants,

05:26.170 --> 05:28.170
she says, "All I need is you."

05:28.370 --> 05:29.270
Well, yeah,
that's what we all say,

05:29.480 --> 05:32.080
but we actually want the gift.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.310
Well,

05:33.510 --> 05:34.750
you know,
I got Miss Tina a present.

05:34.950 --> 05:37.850
I'm going to play her
a song on my recorder.

05:38.050 --> 05:39.280
I've been practicing for weeks.

05:39.490 --> 05:42.890
Grover, that's really sweet
and thoughtful.

05:43.090 --> 05:44.020
Look, say it's from me,

05:44.220 --> 05:45.590
I'll give you $300 cash.

05:45.790 --> 05:48.330
Mixed bills, tens and 20s.
Ooh, money, money.

05:48.530 --> 05:50.500
No, no, no, no.
No money.

05:50.700 --> 05:53.170
Come on, Calvin,
don't give up.

05:53.370 --> 05:55.230
Why not support a good cause
and get her something

05:55.430 --> 05:57.100
from the school auction site?

05:57.300 --> 06:00.070
All right,
I guess it couldn't hurt.

06:00.270 --> 06:01.540
(groans)

06:01.740 --> 06:04.880
Lunch with
the football coach. Boo.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.210
Yeah.
All right.

06:06.410 --> 06:08.080
Juggling lessons.
That's got to be Dave.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.750
(scoffs)

06:09.950 --> 06:11.720
A 60-pound weighted blanket?

06:11.920 --> 06:13.190
How do you get out of bed?

06:13.390 --> 06:16.190
It's been a rough
year for donations.

06:16.390 --> 06:17.420
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

06:17.620 --> 06:20.330
VIP tickets to <i>The Talk.</i>

06:20.530 --> 06:21.460
Tina loves <i>The Talk.</i>

06:21.660 --> 06:23.200
Sheryl Underwood is her girl.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.960
All right, you know what?
I'll buy those.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.820
Great.
Auction goes live tonight.

06:27.680 --> 06:31.570
Okay, well, how about
I give you $300 cash

06:31.770 --> 06:35.390
right now and we cut out
the middleman?

06:36.530 --> 06:39.480
The middleman is
the scholarship fund

06:39.680 --> 06:41.110
for underprivileged kids.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.550
Okay, all right. $375.
No.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.050
$400 and I take Grover
for the night.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.690
We all know he can be a handful.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.440
I'm right here.

06:51.170 --> 06:52.890
* *

06:53.090 --> 06:54.590
Man, this auction is blowing up.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.200
I've had to up my bid,
like, nine times.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.230
<i>Scent of a Woman.</i>

06:58.430 --> 07:00.220
How could I be so stupid?

07:00.980 --> 07:03.040
Okay. All right.
We're down to the last minute.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.800
Okay, here we go-- oh.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.970
Oh...
TINA:
Hey.

07:06.170 --> 07:07.170
(clears throat)
(clears throat)

07:07.370 --> 07:08.210
What are you boys
doing out here?

07:08.410 --> 07:10.260
Oh, you know, uh, watching porn.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.050
No, we are not.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.680
Oh.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.110
I get it. I get it.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.780
The birthday girl is going
to go back inside now.

07:18.980 --> 07:19.950
Yeah. All right.

07:20.150 --> 07:21.220
Bye.

07:21.420 --> 07:22.820
Man, that was terrible.

07:23.020 --> 07:25.620
You're lucky I was here.
You froze up.

07:25.820 --> 07:26.590
(computer chimes)

07:26.790 --> 07:29.330
Oh. Oh, man, I got to up my bid.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.030
Down to the final five seconds.

07:31.230 --> 07:32.700
Okay, here we go.
Okay.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.670
Three, two, one.

07:35.870 --> 07:37.040
Yeah!
Got it!

07:37.240 --> 07:38.540
Yeah, baby! Let's go!

07:38.740 --> 07:39.990
You're going to the...
Shh!

07:41.260 --> 07:44.460
Right, uh, wow, that is
some pretty wild pornography.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.950
* *

07:49.150 --> 07:52.890
(playing poorly)

07:53.090 --> 07:54.970
* *

07:58.840 --> 08:01.860
Oh, wow. Aw.

08:02.060 --> 08:04.000
Oh, thank you, Grover.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.330
Bless your little heart.

08:06.530 --> 08:08.130
That was beautiful.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.770
What was that?
"Sweet Caroline"?

08:09.970 --> 08:12.520
I thought it was
"Back That Azz Up."

08:14.760 --> 08:16.410
He's been working
on it all week.

08:16.610 --> 08:18.580
Yeah, that's easily
the best that it's sounded.

08:18.780 --> 08:20.110
Yeah.
TINA:
Aw.

08:20.310 --> 08:23.320
Well, thank you, Johnson family,
for my lovely perfume.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.820
And the concert.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.950
Yeah, yeah, uh,
nice effort.
(laughs)

08:27.150 --> 08:29.240
Open ours, Mommy.
Oh, oh.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.630
Okay, let me see
what my babies got me.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.010
Ugh.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.750
These are nice.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.900
Is that why you said "ugh"?

08:44.100 --> 08:45.800
Oh, did I? No, no, I...

08:46.000 --> 08:48.670
Well, they look
like old lady sneakers.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.680
No, no, no, no, no.
Th-They're not for old ladies.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.180
They're just padded
to relieve foot pain,

08:52.380 --> 08:54.930
improve posture,
and prevent varicose veins.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.120
Well, when you put
it like that...

08:59.320 --> 09:00.940
Oh, damn.

09:03.510 --> 09:04.660
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.540
They're endorsed by Marla Gibbs.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.080
Y'all got y'all mama
some Air Gibbs?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.370
We have got to get
Mama something else.

09:15.570 --> 09:16.970
Oh, yeah, y'all
definitely do.

09:17.170 --> 09:18.570
Yeah, we know, Gemma.

09:18.770 --> 09:22.470
Well, babe, you're going
to need someplace to wear

09:22.680 --> 09:24.680
your nice new Velcro kicks.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.950
So here you go.
Oh, that's sweet, baby.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.180
What'd you get me?

09:30.380 --> 09:31.680
Oh, my God!

09:31.880 --> 09:34.420
You got me four tickets
to <i>The Talk?</i>
Yes.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.520
I get to see
my girl Sheryl in person?

09:36.720 --> 09:40.730
Oh, baby, this is
the best gift ever.

09:40.930 --> 09:42.490
Hit it, Grover. I'm feeling it.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.330
(playing poorly)
I'm feeling it.

09:44.530 --> 09:47.050
* *

09:56.730 --> 09:58.310
* *

09:58.510 --> 10:01.210
Baby, we are in the front row.

10:01.410 --> 10:03.650
I mean, Sheryl is
going to be right there.

10:03.850 --> 10:04.920
I could touch her.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.220
Okay, you know what?
You know who's else

10:06.420 --> 10:07.890
gonna be right here
is security.

10:08.090 --> 10:09.150
Don't do that, okay?

10:09.350 --> 10:10.620
Okay.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.090
So exciting.

10:12.290 --> 10:13.690
You know, Jerry is
definitely going to see me.

10:13.890 --> 10:16.730
This is the last chance for
me to save our friendship.

10:16.930 --> 10:18.330
There is no friendship.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.920
Well, not with that
attitude, there isn't.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.300
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to <i>The Talk.</i>

10:26.500 --> 10:28.140
- * You and me *
- * <i>You and me</i> *

10:28.340 --> 10:30.280
* You know we make
some real good company *

10:30.480 --> 10:31.510
* <i>Company...</i> *

10:31.710 --> 10:33.750
Oh, my God, it's Sheryl!
It's Sheryl!

10:33.950 --> 10:35.680
* You know we make
some real good company *

10:35.880 --> 10:37.320
Hi, Sheryl!

10:37.520 --> 10:39.620
* *

10:39.820 --> 10:41.420
* Hoppin', we poppin',

10:41.620 --> 10:44.860
* Lord knows I love conversating

10:45.060 --> 10:47.860
(chanting):
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

10:48.060 --> 10:49.090
Jerry!

10:49.290 --> 10:50.700
Wrong show. Wrong Jerry.
Stop doing that.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.700
Stop doing that.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.350
(laughing)

10:54.920 --> 10:57.070
* *

10:57.270 --> 10:59.170
Okay, here's a gift idea.

10:59.370 --> 11:01.640
An LED light therapy
rejuvenation mask.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.180
Are you crazy?

11:03.380 --> 11:06.030
That'll be like telling Mama
her face isn't juvenated.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.450
See, man, look, look.
Look at this.

11:11.650 --> 11:15.120
Ah. Things were so
easy when we were little.
Huh.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.690
We made her an ugly necklace
out of macaroni

11:17.890 --> 11:18.960
and she loved it.

11:19.160 --> 11:22.060
Oh, man.
Yeah, I remember that.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.500
You know, one time

11:23.700 --> 11:25.930
I gave her a Lando Calrissian
action figure

11:26.130 --> 11:27.370
that she bought me,

11:27.570 --> 11:29.000
and she said it was
her favorite gift ever.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.690
Yeah, and then
you took it right back.

11:33.490 --> 11:35.920
She wasn't gonna
play with it.

11:36.890 --> 11:40.150
Well, as you know, we here on
<i>The Talk</i> are big fans of chili.

11:40.350 --> 11:42.450
And today
our own Sheryl Underwood

11:42.650 --> 11:45.050
is going to share
her secret recipe.

11:45.250 --> 11:46.750
(cheering and applauding)

11:46.950 --> 11:49.390
And spoiler alert,
it is good.

11:49.590 --> 11:50.560
So good.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.320
Oh, you guys, stop.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.660
Okay, now, I'm going
to invite a few

11:54.860 --> 11:57.730
lucky audience members
up on stage to sample it.

11:57.930 --> 11:59.100
Anybody hungry?

11:59.300 --> 12:00.330
Me! Me, me, me! Me!
Oh!

12:00.530 --> 12:01.930
I'm starving, I'm starving!

12:02.130 --> 12:03.700
Hey, birthday girl.
Birthday girl right here.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.900
Oh, yeah, a-and the
birthday girl's friends.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.070
And the birthday girl's friend.

12:07.270 --> 12:08.440
Okay, you four. Come on.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.610
Oh. Okay!

12:09.810 --> 12:11.610
Come on, baby.
Come on, let's go.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.280
Oh, I'm so excited.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.610
Hey.

12:14.810 --> 12:16.850
Come on up.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.550
Okay, okay.
Where are you from?

12:19.750 --> 12:21.050
Pasadena, Sheryl.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.690
Uh-huh.
I'm Tina and you're Sheryl.

12:22.890 --> 12:24.260
All day, every day.

12:24.460 --> 12:27.290
Sheryl is standing right here,
Calvin. She's right here.

12:27.490 --> 12:28.690
I can see that, babe.

12:28.890 --> 12:30.360
Was 'cause your man
finally got you

12:30.560 --> 12:31.630
a great birthday present.

12:31.830 --> 12:33.200
Yes, you did, baby...
you're so sweet.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.030
And your birthday's
about to get even better

12:35.230 --> 12:37.170
because I'm going
to make you some chili.

12:37.370 --> 12:38.300
GEMMA: Ooh.
Ooh!

12:38.500 --> 12:39.910
(audience applauding)

12:40.110 --> 12:41.670
Hey, Jerry O'Connell.

12:41.870 --> 12:45.530
Why don't you come
and, uh, <i>Stand by Me?</i>

12:46.860 --> 12:48.510
Yes, that was, uh, that was

12:48.710 --> 12:51.000
a movie I was actually in.
Very good. Very good.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.720
Very good.
All right, let's get cooking.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.150
Yes. Show me the chili!

12:56.350 --> 12:58.020
Okay. Yeah.
I was also in <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

12:58.220 --> 12:59.960
Let's move on. We're moving on.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.160
DAVE:
Got him.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.200
Okay, I need an assistant chef.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.730
Oh, oh, you got to pick my baby.

13:05.930 --> 13:08.530
She's been cooking me the best
chili for over 30 years.

13:08.730 --> 13:09.670
Oh, stop it, baby.

13:09.870 --> 13:13.240
Oh, looks like
I got some competition.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.640
Oh, wow. Mom is on TV
cooking with her hero.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.740
DAVE: What kind of cheese
are you going to use,

13:18.940 --> 13:24.300
Jerry O'Connell? Monterey Jack
or... <i>Kangaroo Jack?</i> (chuckles)

13:25.070 --> 13:27.170
Oh, David.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.260
As every great cook knows,

13:30.460 --> 13:32.830
the secret to chili
is the spices.

13:33.030 --> 13:35.160
And I got my own
special blend.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.600
Cayenne.
Ooh, all right, now.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.030
Paprika.
Oh, I see you. I see you.

13:40.230 --> 13:41.030
Mustard seed.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.070
AKBAR: Ooh.
Huh?

13:43.270 --> 13:46.140
And a little something-something
that they won't see coming.

13:46.340 --> 13:47.510
Horseradish.

13:47.710 --> 13:49.170
Mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.610
NATALIE:
All right, everybody,

13:50.810 --> 13:52.880
you have Sheryl's chili
in front of you,

13:53.080 --> 13:54.510
so let's dig in.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.210
DAVE: All right.

13:56.410 --> 13:59.150
AKBAR: Okay.
All right.
Okay.

13:59.350 --> 14:01.150
(clears throat) Mmm.

14:01.350 --> 14:03.390
Mmm.
This is good.

14:03.590 --> 14:04.790
This is so good, Sheryl.

14:04.990 --> 14:06.020
It's really good.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.990
Here you go,
birthday girl.

14:08.190 --> 14:10.660
Bon appétit.
All right. Okay.

14:10.860 --> 14:13.450
Thank you, Sheryl.

14:20.390 --> 14:22.340
You don't like it?

14:22.540 --> 14:24.490
I do. It's so good.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.810
This is a masterpiece. Yeah.

14:28.010 --> 14:31.670
You know what? All this need
is a whole bunch of crackers.

14:34.070 --> 14:36.190
Tina doesn't like my chili.

14:36.390 --> 14:37.760
You all like my chili, right?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.090
Oh, yeah, yeah, so, so good.
It's so yummy.

14:40.290 --> 14:41.490
Amazing.

14:41.690 --> 14:43.830
I'm almost done. Yeah.
Hey. This is spicy.

14:44.030 --> 14:46.130
So it's just you.
No.

14:46.330 --> 14:48.430
No, no, no.
Because I-I love it.

14:48.630 --> 14:50.270
I love it. The chili is good.

14:50.470 --> 14:51.900
Okay, then-then
eat some more.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.010
Go ahead.

14:53.210 --> 14:55.710
Okay, let me...
<i>Mangia.</i>

14:55.910 --> 14:58.540
...have some more chili.
(forced laugh)

14:58.740 --> 15:00.430
(groans)

15:07.540 --> 15:09.020
I think this segment is over.

15:09.220 --> 15:13.130
And I think y'all been lying
about my chili this whole time.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.460
JERRY:
You know what?

15:14.660 --> 15:16.490
We're going to pay
some bills right now, okay?

15:16.690 --> 15:18.930
We'll be right back
with more <i>Talk.</i>

15:19.130 --> 15:21.320
(audience applauding)

15:22.420 --> 15:24.300
AKBAR:
Aw.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.810
Oh, Sheryl, don't be like that.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.210
See what you did, Akbar?

15:29.410 --> 15:31.580
Sheryl!

15:31.780 --> 15:34.910
* *

15:35.110 --> 15:37.020
Hey. Gemma?

15:37.220 --> 15:38.680
Calvin, what are you doing here?

15:38.880 --> 15:42.750
(sighs) Look, I need
you to do me a favor.

15:42.950 --> 15:45.120
I need to talk
to Jerry O'Connell.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.360
No. Nuh-uh.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.960
After what happened
this morning?

15:49.160 --> 15:51.130
Well, that's the thing.

15:51.330 --> 15:53.830
Look, I finally got Tina
the perfect gift,

15:54.030 --> 15:56.720
and it wound up being
her worst birthday ever.

15:57.920 --> 16:01.970
She told me she wished
I just ran over her feet again.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.480
I understand.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.210
But I can't allow you
to approach

16:06.410 --> 16:08.010
a parent on school property

16:08.210 --> 16:09.580
without proper...
Hey, Erica.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.520
Ooh, there he is.
Hey, Jerry!

16:11.720 --> 16:15.690
Jerry. Oh, sorry.
Oh! Why? Why?

16:15.890 --> 16:17.090
(stammering)

16:17.290 --> 16:18.860
You okay?

16:19.060 --> 16:20.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Please, please tell me

16:20.760 --> 16:22.230
that guy Dave
is not with you.

16:22.430 --> 16:24.230
Uh...

16:24.430 --> 16:27.280
Oh, no, no, no, I barely
know that guy, man.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.340
Hey, look, Jerry, um,

16:30.540 --> 16:32.970
my wife Tina,
she loves Sheryl so much,

16:33.170 --> 16:37.040
and, uh, this morning, you know,
it-it ruined her birthday.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.980
Uh, I think we should move on.

16:39.180 --> 16:41.650
Here's the weighted blanket
you won at the auction.

16:41.850 --> 16:44.980
(grunting)

16:45.180 --> 16:46.220
You okay?
Oh, yeah.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.690
I got it, I got it.

16:47.890 --> 16:50.360
Look, I-I was just hoping
that maybe

16:50.560 --> 16:52.360
you could put Tina
in touch with Sheryl

16:52.560 --> 16:54.060
so that she can apologize.

16:54.260 --> 16:55.430
Well, I-I'd love
to help you out,

16:55.630 --> 16:56.890
but Sheryl is not
upset with your wife.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.500
Sheryl's upset with
us for not being

16:58.700 --> 17:00.600
more real with her
about her chili,

17:00.800 --> 17:02.130
which is not great chili.

17:02.330 --> 17:06.500
Yeah, I'm not sure
if it was even chili.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.440
We were just trying
to spare her feelings,

17:08.640 --> 17:10.710
and now Sheryl's
embarrassed.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.610
She said she's never
cooking on our show again.

17:12.810 --> 17:16.880
O-Okay, well, maybe
we can help each other out.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.650
Come on, let me help you
with that blanket.

17:18.850 --> 17:21.520
(grunts)
You know, it just so happens

17:21.720 --> 17:23.390
my wife makes a mean chili.

17:23.590 --> 17:25.290
Oh, I certainly
believe the mean part.

17:25.490 --> 17:26.860
(chuckles)
Slow your roll.

17:27.060 --> 17:28.960
That's my wife
we talking about now.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.800
* *

17:32.000 --> 17:34.270
SHERYL:
Tina doesn't like my chili.
Pause.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.950
Right there.
Look at my face.

17:38.790 --> 17:42.310
Yeah. That's not pretty.
Ugh.

17:42.510 --> 17:43.480
You're an attractive woman,

17:43.680 --> 17:45.630
but that's not a good face.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.110
Babe, I know your
birthday is over...

17:49.310 --> 17:51.930
Are you day-drinking with Dave?

17:53.200 --> 17:56.200
You know, I don't think
Akbar liked me either.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.120
Anyway, look, I know
your birthday's over,

17:59.320 --> 18:00.430
but I got one more gift for you,

18:00.630 --> 18:02.330
and it's a chance
to make things right.

18:02.530 --> 18:04.630
I just want you...
So you're just gonna leave
me on the front porch

18:04.830 --> 18:06.510
like I'm an Amazon package?

18:08.650 --> 18:09.730
Hello, Tina.

18:09.930 --> 18:12.640
Calvin, Sheryl Underwood
is in my house.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.410
I know, babe. I brought her.

18:15.610 --> 18:17.610
Sheryl Underwood,

18:17.810 --> 18:20.380
I am so sorry
about this morning.

18:20.580 --> 18:22.350
It's, it's just my face.
You know?

18:22.550 --> 18:23.780
It-it won't lie.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.420
Girl, I know it.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.800
I watched it back on slow-mo.

18:29.470 --> 18:30.720
But I want to thank you.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.020
You were the only one
that was honest with me.

18:33.230 --> 18:34.460
Oh.

18:34.660 --> 18:37.760
I hated the chili, too.
Even more than her.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.400
Little late,
Jerry O'Connell superfan.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.840
Uh, so he mentioned me?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.970
Nobody's talking
about you, Dave.

18:47.170 --> 18:49.970
Tina, I brought Sheryl here
so that you could teach her

18:50.170 --> 18:51.640
how to make chili
the right way.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.550
Oh, hell yeah, I will.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.080
Come on, girl. Let me
get you a glass of wine.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.120
That's all right, girl.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.390
I got one.

19:00.590 --> 19:03.460
Calvin! Sheryl Underwood
is in my kitchen.

19:03.660 --> 19:04.960
I can see.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.180
This is the best birthday ever.
Again.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.800
So, what do I need to know?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.130
Okay, first off,
the horseradish has got to go.

19:13.330 --> 19:14.700
That's my mother's recipe.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.870
Oh, she doesn't know
how to cook either, huh?

19:17.070 --> 19:18.050
Tina!

19:24.260 --> 19:25.840
Ooh, okay.
Where are you taking me?
No, no,

19:26.040 --> 19:27.550
Keep your eyes closed.
Okay.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.080
Okay. Almost.
Almost.
All right.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.750
And open 'em.

19:32.950 --> 19:34.570
Ta-da!

19:35.670 --> 19:37.090
Wow. What's all this?

19:37.290 --> 19:38.290
It's your present.

19:38.490 --> 19:40.230
Look, Ma, we-we were
trying to find

19:40.430 --> 19:42.160
the perfect birthday
present for you,

19:42.360 --> 19:45.630
and we remembered that
you really loved this one.

19:45.830 --> 19:47.030
Aw.

19:47.230 --> 19:49.070
We remember this day
as being pretty much perfect,

19:49.270 --> 19:50.440
so we decided to recreate it.

19:50.640 --> 19:53.740
Oh, thank you.
Are those sandwiches?

19:53.940 --> 19:54.740
Yep.

19:54.940 --> 19:56.790
Tuna fish and Cheetos.

19:57.690 --> 19:58.980
(laughs)
Yep, there's the yucky face.

19:59.180 --> 20:00.880
There it is.

20:01.080 --> 20:03.050
But I love it. I will eat it.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.750
Thank you. Boys, this is...

20:05.950 --> 20:07.790
This is all I could want.

20:07.990 --> 20:08.950
Mwah.

20:09.150 --> 20:09.990
My babies. Mwah.

20:10.190 --> 20:11.290
Happy birthday, Mama.

20:11.490 --> 20:12.660
Thank you. This is...
Okay, Mom,

20:12.860 --> 20:14.060
I need you to smile,
we about take a picture.

20:14.260 --> 20:15.060
All right, come on.
Okay.

20:15.260 --> 20:16.590
Let's take a picture

20:16.790 --> 20:18.530
with my babies.

20:18.730 --> 20:21.000
Here we go.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.600
Three, two...

20:22.800 --> 20:24.340
What y'all looking at?

20:24.540 --> 20:25.600
Dad.
Come on, Pop.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.970
We're trying to recreate
this photo.

20:28.170 --> 20:29.610
Oh, but, man,
I didn't know.

20:29.810 --> 20:31.340
That's okay, baby, why don't
you just get in the picture?

20:31.540 --> 20:33.300
Oh, okay. All right, good.
Let's do it.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.480
Come on, baby. Here we go.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.450
And three, two--

20:37.650 --> 20:39.250
Ooh, do I smell
Cheetos and tuna?

20:39.450 --> 20:40.350
Ah, Dave.
David.

20:40.550 --> 20:42.220
They're trying to take a photo.

20:42.420 --> 20:45.260
Oh, you know what? Let's just
do one with everybody.
All right.

20:45.460 --> 20:46.720
Come on. Here we go.
Come on, brother.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.430
CALVIN: Get in. Get in.
All right. Good.

20:48.630 --> 20:49.530
And...

20:49.730 --> 20:52.000
All right, everybody say chili.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.400
Chili!

20:53.600 --> 20:55.530
