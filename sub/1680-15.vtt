00:00.180 --> 00:03.580
Kids,the spring of 2008 was a pretty great time for me

00:04.050 --> 00:05.490
Stella and I had started dating,

00:05.590 --> 00:07.080
And I'd just gotten a big raise at work,

00:07.160 --> 00:08.700
So I decided to purchase something I knew

00:08.760 --> 00:10.300
Would be the envy of all my friends.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.100
A new car!

00:12.160 --> 00:15.060
Ted, this is new york city-- you're never gonna drive it.

00:15.130 --> 00:17.230
This is a really, really stupid purchase,

00:17.230 --> 00:20.700
And I'm sorry, but none of us can support it.

00:20.760 --> 00:21.900
Shotgun for eternity!

00:21.960 --> 00:23.300
You can't call shotgun for eternity.

00:23.360 --> 00:24.500
I just called it.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.500
You can't just call things, barney.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.700
I call that I can call things!

00:27.760 --> 00:28.700
hey, baby.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.000
Beer.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.330
Are you okay?

00:33.400 --> 00:36.460
Beer.

00:42.230 --> 00:43.660
Okay, what happened?

00:43.730 --> 00:46.230
They always told me that working at a big law firm

00:46.300 --> 00:47.760
Was like being at war.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.200
You get out of law school,

00:49.260 --> 00:50.830
It's like getting out of boot camp.

00:50.900 --> 00:52.930
That first day at work, you're storming the beaches,

00:53.000 --> 00:54.700
Full of piss and vinegar...

00:54.760 --> 00:56.400
Dude, we're lawyers now.

00:56.460 --> 00:57.600
Totally.

00:57.660 --> 00:58.960
We've got briefcases and everything.

00:59.030 --> 01:00.530
Freakin' briefcases.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.960
You have anything in yours?

01:02.030 --> 01:03.430
Totally empty. you?

01:03.500 --> 01:04.599
Candy bars.

01:08.100 --> 01:11.230
Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies

01:11.300 --> 01:13.100
And you feel a sense of camaraderie.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.630
But before too long...

01:14.700 --> 01:15.760
Hey, marshall.

01:15.830 --> 01:16.800
...the shells start to fall.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.060
Hello, arthur.

01:19.430 --> 01:20.930
Arthur hobbes is one of the senior partners

01:21.000 --> 01:23.360
At my firm, and he's... he's my boss.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.560
He seems like a nice guy,

01:25.630 --> 01:26.730
But he's got a nickname...

01:27.560 --> 01:29.430
Artillery arthur.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.000
How's your morning going?

01:31.060 --> 01:32.900
It's going fine-- how is yours?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.430
Not too bad, not too bad.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.500
Hey, is ferguson in yet?

01:36.560 --> 01:38.560
He is, he's in... just in his office next door.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.800
That's great-- have a good one, buddy.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.060
You, too.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.800
You never know who's gonna get hit...

01:45.860 --> 01:47.260
Hey, ferguson!

01:47.330 --> 01:49.760
I read your report, and it's complete crap!

01:49.830 --> 01:51.800
No, you know what? that's an insult to crap.

01:51.860 --> 01:55.260
If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that!

01:55.330 --> 01:58.860
Your report is the crap that crap craps!

01:58.930 --> 02:01.500
If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked!

02:01.560 --> 02:02.700
Shocked!

02:04.860 --> 02:06.400
It was brutal,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.530
But the worst was a few minutes later.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.630
Did you hear that?

02:12.700 --> 02:15.360
Yeah, sorry.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.860
Can you believe he did that

02:16.930 --> 02:19.430
On take your daughter to work day?

02:23.160 --> 02:24.730
So that brings us to today.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.200
Oh, no.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.300
A little background.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.800
So I'm working on this report

02:28.860 --> 02:32.330
Called "using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent

02:32.400 --> 02:34.330
"to contest a class certification order

02:34.400 --> 02:36.830
Based on a lack of commonality, numerosity..."

02:36.900 --> 02:38.130
Dude, you lost us.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.260
Can't you just call it something cool

02:39.330 --> 02:40.460
Like "the ninja report"?

02:40.530 --> 02:43.360
Okay. yeah, fine, whatever.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.530
Um, so I'm supposed

02:44.600 --> 02:45.960
To turn in "the ninja report" yesterday.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.630
-Awesome. -wow. cool.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.160
But I got insanely busy with other stuff,

02:50.230 --> 02:52.260
I didn't get a chance to finish it,

02:52.330 --> 02:54.130
And then this morning...

02:54.200 --> 02:55.630
-Hey, ferguson. -hey, arthur.

02:55.700 --> 02:56.960
How's your day going?

02:57.030 --> 02:59.100
-I gotta go. -great. how is yours?

02:59.160 --> 03:00.800
Great, great-- hey, is marshall in yet?

03:00.860 --> 03:02.500
Oh, thank god.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.900
Yeah, he's right in there.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.500
Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.600
And then...

03:11.660 --> 03:13.100
He screamed at me.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.260
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

03:15.330 --> 03:16.900
What, that's it?

03:16.960 --> 03:20.160
You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?

03:20.230 --> 03:21.660
Barney, I have never been screamed at

03:21.730 --> 03:23.330
Like that in my life.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.530
Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.460
I got screamed at three times today.

03:27.530 --> 03:28.800
Once in korean.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.930
This is corporate america, marshall.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.730
Screaming is a motivational tool,

03:33.800 --> 03:36.100
Like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.260
It's just good business.

03:38.330 --> 03:41.430
Oh, baby, it's just not fair.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.500
You've been working so hard.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.830
Late nights, weekends.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.030
I never see you.

03:51.660 --> 03:54.130
We've barely made love in weeks.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.360
It's bad, guys,mama needs her sugar.

04:00.430 --> 04:03.800
Look, marshall, he screamed at you, you took it.

04:03.860 --> 04:05.430
He probably respects you more for it.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.530
Yeah, about that...

04:08.600 --> 04:12.630
So arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment...

04:14.300 --> 04:15.860
Face turning red,

04:15.930 --> 04:18.500
Vein in his forehead about to burst,

04:18.560 --> 04:22.130
Spittle flying like shrapnel.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.730
Everyone you work with walking by your office,

04:23.800 --> 04:26.330
Peering in.

04:29.530 --> 04:32.830
And suddenly, I just felt all of it.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.000
All of what?

04:34.060 --> 04:35.430
All of it.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.100
The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment,

04:38.160 --> 04:40.230
And now I'm working for the bad guys instead.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.030
The fact that I am stuck in this job

04:43.100 --> 04:44.700
Because of a mortgage I can barely afford

04:44.760 --> 04:46.630
On an apartment that is crooked.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.060
The fact that I am a grown man, 

04:48.160 --> 04:50.760
and nobody, not even artillery arthur,

04:50.860 --> 04:52.660
Has the right to talk to me like that!

04:54.000 --> 04:56.500
I begged my body not to do it.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.730
But it was no use.

05:05.830 --> 05:09.000
I just... I just...

05:14.460 --> 05:17.130
Just because you weren't around for this,

05:17.200 --> 05:19.560
I called shotgun for all eternity in ted's car.

05:34.730 --> 05:38.360
dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.860
I don't know what happened.

05:39.930 --> 05:41.800
There's just something about being yelled at like that,

05:41.860 --> 05:44.560
Like I was being scolded by my dad.

05:44.630 --> 05:47.230
Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.730
Is "boy" the right word?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.600
I felt absolutely powerless.

05:52.660 --> 05:55.730
Flaccid-- hell, i... I felt castrated.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.300
God, you're hot right now.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.730
And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk

06:00.800 --> 06:03.100
Into arthur's office and give him the ninja report.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.230
Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.760
How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?

06:07.830 --> 06:10.500
Here's what I would do if I were you.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.230
Hi, arthur.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.600
Hello, marshall.

06:14.660 --> 06:16.560
Have you finally finished the ninja report?

06:16.630 --> 06:18.600
Yeah, I got it.

06:19.330 --> 06:20.430
Right here.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.160
I think it's gonna blow you away.

06:25.230 --> 06:28.230
Please, I have a family.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.100
So we good?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.600
We're so good.

06:31.660 --> 06:34.030
Then why are you still in my office?

06:39.730 --> 06:42.460
Okay, gun violence might be the answer to everything

06:42.530 --> 06:44.400
Up in canada, robin,

06:44.460 --> 06:47.660
But here in america, we solve our problems with words.

06:47.730 --> 06:50.500
Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy

06:50.560 --> 06:53.360
With a big eloquent speech defending human dignity.

06:53.430 --> 06:55.000
Like abraham lincoln.

06:55.060 --> 06:58.400
Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big,

06:58.460 --> 07:00.630
Eloquent speech off the top of your head.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.660
Observe.

07:02.730 --> 07:03.960
Arthur?

07:04.030 --> 07:05.030
What do you want, marshall?

07:05.100 --> 07:07.530
Justice, sir.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.800
You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights,

07:09.860 --> 07:11.800
The most fundamentally paramount of which

07:11.860 --> 07:14.200
Is the right...

07:14.260 --> 07:16.360
Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount.

07:16.430 --> 07:18.100
One means highest, one means lowest.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.200
You are nailing this.

07:20.260 --> 07:22.130
Human beings have rights,

07:22.200 --> 07:25.230
And those rights are, um...

07:25.300 --> 07:27.400
You got me hooked, reel me in.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.160
There are certain justices

07:29.230 --> 07:31.130
That cannot or will not

07:31.200 --> 07:34.500
Be inalienable... as such...

07:34.560 --> 07:35.960
For the future.

07:36.030 --> 07:38.230
Stuck the landing-- bravo!

07:38.300 --> 07:39.230
Thank you.

07:41.300 --> 07:44.060
Security's gonna rough you up a bit on t way out.

07:47.230 --> 07:50.130
Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.600
I can't have some big confrontation with arthur.

07:52.660 --> 07:55.260
I need this job, i... I need the money.

07:55.330 --> 07:57.400
Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow,

07:57.460 --> 07:58.500
Tell him off and then quit?

07:58.560 --> 07:59.930
It's great to fantasize about,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
But nobody ever actually does it.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.560
Gary blauman did it.

08:03.630 --> 08:06.760
Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.500
We were at the morning meeting

08:08.560 --> 08:11.560
and old blauman was getting reamed out but good.

08:11.630 --> 08:12.930
Pretty much routine

08:13.000 --> 08:14.500
At the morning meeting, but then,

08:14.560 --> 08:17.530
On this particular day, something amazing happened.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.930
You made yourself look bad,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.160
You made this company look bad, and quite frankly,

08:21.230 --> 08:24.760
You made our friends, the north koreans, look bad!

08:24.830 --> 08:26.260
And I'll tell you something else,

08:26.330 --> 08:28.100
Blauman, if you think for one moment...

08:28.160 --> 08:29.700
You know what, bilson?

08:29.760 --> 08:31.460
You can kiss my ass.

08:31.530 --> 08:33.700
Oh, snap.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.530
-What? -you heard me.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.030
I don't need to take your crap anymore.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.360
My cousin's website went public today,

08:40.429 --> 08:42.400
And I made a pile of money on the ipo,

08:42.460 --> 08:45.500
so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?

08:49.630 --> 08:50.860
Oh, my god.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.700
He peed on the conference table?

08:54.730 --> 08:56.000
Come on, come on, come on,

08:56.060 --> 08:58.500
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.500
Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second

09:01.560 --> 09:02.700
Till I get started?

09:03.700 --> 09:05.560
Come on.

09:05.630 --> 09:07.460
Come on.

09:07.530 --> 09:10.160
Does this help?

09:10.230 --> 09:12.460
W ur eventually, he just gave up and left.

09:12.530 --> 09:14.660
And then his cousin's website tanked.

09:14.730 --> 09:16.960
And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home

09:17.030 --> 09:20.560
And moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.600
That's it? that's the end of the story?

09:24.660 --> 09:27.300
No, no, of course not-- he died.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.030
How does that help me?

09:29.100 --> 09:30.960
How does any of this help me?

09:31.030 --> 09:32.960
Can somebody, for god's sakes,

09:33.060 --> 09:36.260
Please give me one piece of useful advice?

09:36.330 --> 09:38.230
Lily, control your woman.

09:39.630 --> 09:42.260
The lesson of blauman is that when your boss

09:42.330 --> 09:44.830
Screams at you, you never scream back.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.900
That's why there's a little thing in corporate america

09:46.960 --> 09:50.060
I like to call the chain of screaming.

09:50.130 --> 09:51.800
-Chain of screaming? -yes.

09:51.860 --> 09:54.330
The chain of screaming starts at the top.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.700
Arthur's boss's boss screams at arthur's boss.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.330
Arthur's boss screams at arthur.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.400
Arthur screams at you.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.900
You go home and scream at lily.

10:04.960 --> 10:09.200
Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.230
Then that kid screams at her dad,

10:12.300 --> 10:14.860
Arthur's boss's boss.

10:14.930 --> 10:17.730
And the whole thing starts all over again,

10:17.800 --> 10:20.930
Thus completing the circle of screaming.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.460
I thought it was a chain of screaming.

10:22.530 --> 10:25.000
It's a circle, ted, I called it a circle.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.160
I don't scream at lily.

10:27.230 --> 10:29.130
And I don't scream at my kids,

10:29.200 --> 10:31.860
None of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.700
So it's not a circle.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.860
Fine-- you want it to be a chain of screaming,

10:35.930 --> 10:37.400
It's a chain of screaming.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.930
I came up with the circle idea halfway through,

10:39.000 --> 10:40.860
Cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor,

10:40.930 --> 10:42.400
But fine, ruin it!

10:42.460 --> 10:44.530
You guys always undermine me

10:44.600 --> 10:46.960
When I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it!

10:47.030 --> 10:49.360
God, I'm surrounded by idiots!

10:49.430 --> 10:51.260
Idiots!

10:53.700 --> 10:56.460
See, doesn't everyone feel better now?

10:56.530 --> 10:58.360
Lily, I need your take on this.

10:58.430 --> 11:00.030
What... what should I do?

11:00.100 --> 11:02.300
Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...

11:02.360 --> 11:03.960
Oh, god.

11:04.030 --> 11:07.700
Kt.is, when dealing with a bully, the most important thing

11:07.760 --> 11:10.030
Is to be constructive and positive.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.860
Hello, arthur.

11:11.930 --> 11:13.060
Hello, marshall.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.630
I have the ninja report right here.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.200
But arthur,

11:17.260 --> 11:20.360
In the future, if you want someone to do their best work,

11:20.430 --> 11:23.800
Try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation,

11:23.860 --> 11:27.800
But through encouragement, inspiration and respect.

11:29.130 --> 11:32.300
Well said, marshall-- I needed to hear that.

11:33.330 --> 11:34.600
By the way,

11:34.660 --> 11:36.460
I saw your wife's picture in your office.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.530
That is one tasty slice.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.860
Oh, you're damn right.

11:38.930 --> 11:41.500
You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?

11:41.560 --> 11:43.200
Oh, yeah.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.160
I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...

11:45.230 --> 11:46.560
That's it.

11:46.630 --> 11:47.900
...just throw her on the bed...

11:47.960 --> 11:49.530
That's where she belongs.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.060
...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!

11:56.760 --> 11:58.500
It's bad, guys.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.160
Mama needs it bad.

12:01.760 --> 12:04.360
You're right, baby, it's about respect.

12:04.430 --> 12:06.730
That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.300
Can you give me that speech again?

12:08.360 --> 12:10.460
I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...

12:10.530 --> 12:11.800
No, the other part, please.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.530
I have the ninja report right here, but...

12:14.600 --> 12:16.530
And it seemed like that was the end of it,

12:16.600 --> 12:18.200
But it wasn't, because the next night...

12:18.260 --> 12:20.330
Which of these carpets would look better

12:20.400 --> 12:21.860
In the new apartment?

12:21.930 --> 12:25.060
I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft.

12:25.130 --> 12:27.260
It would feel great on your bare feet...

12:27.330 --> 12:31.900
...or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat

12:31.960 --> 12:33.560
Rolling down

12:33.630 --> 12:35.500
Your trembling bosom.

12:37.630 --> 12:40.400
Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?

12:44.300 --> 12:45.500
Shh, don't say my name.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.400
Lily can't know it's me.

12:47.460 --> 12:48.660
Just pretend you're talking to stella.

12:48.730 --> 12:49.830
Be all lovey dovey.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.500
Hey, stella.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.830
Sweetie, how's it going?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.930
Not good, not good at all.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.330
Where are you right now?

12:59.400 --> 13:02.160
Right downstairs, come find me.

13:02.230 --> 13:03.860
Without lily.

13:03.930 --> 13:06.660
Okay, I'll see you soon.

13:06.730 --> 13:08.600
I love you.

13:08.660 --> 13:10.430
I love you, too.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.800
Wow, you two are already saying the "l" word, huh?

13:15.860 --> 13:17.130
Apparently.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.030
You hitting that?

13:28.630 --> 13:30.560
I'm in trouble, ted.

13:32.830 --> 13:34.560
Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.

13:34.630 --> 13:38.060
Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...

13:38.130 --> 13:39.930
I did something stupid-- can we just drive somewhere?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.560
I need to get away-- just drive, man.

13:41.630 --> 13:42.930
Please just drive.

13:44.430 --> 13:46.500
It's just, this is a really good parking spot.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.000
Dude!

13:48.060 --> 13:49.700
Look, just tell me what happened first.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.930
Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
That lily told me to give, be firm but respectful?

13:54.060 --> 13:55.560
Well, it didn't totally go that way.

13:55.630 --> 13:57.030
There is a lot of ketchup on that burger.

13:58.060 --> 14:00.360
Sorry-- what happened?

14:00.430 --> 14:01.960
After we all finished talking last night,

14:02.030 --> 14:04.430
I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.

14:05.830 --> 14:06.830
Hey, marshall.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.760
How long have you been sitting there?

14:10.830 --> 14:13.560
If you go in there with lily's kindergarten nonsense,

14:13.630 --> 14:15.200
You're gonna get torn apart.

14:15.260 --> 14:17.230
I'm here to save your life-- you hungry?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.100
Yeah, I was just about to order.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.430
What do you want?

14:20.500 --> 14:21.700
A blt and gravy fries.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.600
Okay, friends, what do you like?

14:24.660 --> 14:26.530
A green tea with lemon for me,

14:26.600 --> 14:28.730
And for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.800
Very good.

14:29.860 --> 14:32.230
No, I didn't want meatloaf.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.460
Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing.

14:35.530 --> 14:39.060
Arthur screamed at you-- now you have to scream at someone else.

14:39.130 --> 14:40.500
No, I don't.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.500
Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.730
Who would I even scream at?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.130
I don't know.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.700
How about somebody who's disappointed you?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.430
Someone who's let you down.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.760
Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf

14:54.830 --> 14:59.530
When you explicitly ordered a blt and gravy fries.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.300
No.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.960
Hey, I was just heading to the bar.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.360
What are you guys doing out here?

15:07.430 --> 15:08.500
Oh, I was just telling ted a story.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.630
Ooh, I like stories.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.400
You want a lick?

15:13.730 --> 15:16.360
-What? -is that ice cream cone big enough?

15:16.430 --> 15:18.630
Uh, it's delicious enough.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.530
Okay, so...

15:20.600 --> 15:21.930
Then I say to barney...

15:22.000 --> 15:24.760
I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.

15:24.830 --> 15:26.030
Yes, you are.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.560
That waiter is every boss and every bully

15:30.630 --> 15:32.760
Who ever embarrassed or belittled you.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.230
And how dare he deny you

15:35.300 --> 15:36.630
The one thing that you want,

15:36.700 --> 15:38.730
That would make you happy at this moment.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.230
A blt and gravy fries.

15:42.530 --> 15:45.660
One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf.

15:45.730 --> 15:48.500
Enjoy, my friends.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.530
Marshall.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.930
Excuse me?

15:52.730 --> 15:54.160
Yes?

15:54.230 --> 15:56.030
This is not what I ordered.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.130
Yes, it is.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.000
I beg your pardon, sir,

16:03.060 --> 16:06.300
But I ordered a blt and gravy fries,

16:06.360 --> 16:08.830
And as the customer, I'm always right, so...

16:08.900 --> 16:12.460
No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this!

16:12.560 --> 16:16.160
I am at the end of a triple shift-- that's 18 hours!--

16:16.230 --> 16:17.360
And then I have

16:17.430 --> 16:19.400
To take two trains and a bus to astoria

16:19.460 --> 16:22.760
To have my wife scream at me because I'm never home.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.960
No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!

16:28.600 --> 16:30.530
Hey, what are you guys doing out here?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.360
Oh sweet, can I get a toot?

16:32.430 --> 16:34.000
Uh-uh-- against car rules, it's against car rules!

16:34.060 --> 16:35.960
Oh, ted, relax, it's cuban.

16:36.030 --> 16:37.860
People pay to have their car smell like this.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.530
Well, that's just not true.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.930
Oh, marshall, switch seats with me.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.230
I called shotgun for all eternity.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.460
You can't call shotgun for eternity.

16:44.530 --> 16:45.960
Well, that's funny, cause I did!

16:46.030 --> 16:47.300
It's case by case.

16:47.360 --> 16:50.060
Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!

16:51.200 --> 16:53.460
A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?

16:53.530 --> 16:56.260
I don't know, barney, he worked a triple, it just...

16:56.330 --> 16:58.260
If you're not gonna yell at the waiter,

16:58.330 --> 16:59.560
Yell at me.

16:59.630 --> 17:01.230
-What? -yell at me.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.100
I'm not gonna yell at you, barney.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.000
What, you think you're gonna upset me?

17:05.060 --> 17:07.060
Please, give me your best shot.

17:07.130 --> 17:08.900
Okay, fine-- what, you want me to yell at you?

17:08.960 --> 17:10.660
Yeah.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.900
This is me yelling at you, barney.

17:13.960 --> 17:17.000
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly

17:17.060 --> 17:19.500
Landing on a leaf about three blocks away.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.599
This is me yelling at you, barney!

17:22.660 --> 17:25.430
Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.960
Make it hurt.

17:27.030 --> 17:30.160
You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!

17:30.230 --> 17:31.830
No, something that's true-- come on.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.260
The man made you cry.

17:33.330 --> 17:34.860
Make me cry.

17:34.930 --> 17:36.030
Your mom's a slut!

17:36.100 --> 17:37.660
Yes.

17:37.730 --> 17:40.460
Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, barney,

17:40.530 --> 17:42.860
But you and your brother clearly have different fathers,

17:42.930 --> 17:44.360
And you know why?

17:44.430 --> 17:46.400
It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!

17:46.460 --> 17:47.530
Keep going.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.200
I don't care what you say.

17:49.260 --> 17:50.700
Bob barker is not your father!

17:50.760 --> 17:53.160
Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.

17:53.230 --> 17:54.500
Oh my god, barney, I'm so sorry...

17:54.560 --> 17:56.000
No, I'm kidding-- keep going.

17:56.060 --> 17:57.600
Bob barker's not your father!

17:57.660 --> 18:01.030
You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host

18:01.100 --> 18:02.860
Is your real father, and he's not!

18:02.930 --> 18:05.100
You were abandoned, barney!

18:05.160 --> 18:07.060
You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it,

18:07.130 --> 18:08.530
And so now you never allow yourself

18:08.600 --> 18:10.400
To feel anything, and that's how you survive

18:10.460 --> 18:12.360
In this corporate world, and if I keep heading

18:12.430 --> 18:14.600
Down this path, I'm gonna turn into you!

18:14.660 --> 18:16.600
And I don't want that!

18:16.660 --> 18:18.630
I don't want any of this!

18:18.700 --> 18:20.900
This is not why I became a lawyer.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.360
This is not the person that I wanted to be.

18:23.430 --> 18:26.060
I quit, arthur!

18:26.130 --> 18:28.360
I quit!

18:30.860 --> 18:34.860
Well, thank you, eriksen, I needed to hear that.

18:34.930 --> 18:37.030
Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally,

18:37.100 --> 18:38.430
It's just that i...

18:38.500 --> 18:40.460
No, no, no, the part where you said, "i quit."

18:40.530 --> 18:42.560
Now we don't have to pay you a severance package.

18:44.460 --> 18:47.460
Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.360
Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...

18:56.430 --> 18:57.360
-Dude! -dude! -dude!

18:57.430 --> 18:58.600
I'm sorry.

18:58.660 --> 19:00.330
Don't blame this on me, marshall.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.330
I told you to yell at someone beneath you.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.230
The circle of screaming is...

19:04.300 --> 19:06.400
The chain of scr...

19:06.460 --> 19:08.800
Pyramid-- the pyramid of screaming!

19:08.860 --> 19:10.660
The pyramid of screaming.

19:10.730 --> 19:12.930
How am I supposed to tell lily?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.800
She supported me through three years of law school,

19:14.860 --> 19:17.160
And now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.760
Now we're gonna lose the apartment.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.160
The place where we were gonna raise our children.

19:22.230 --> 19:24.630
How am I supposed to tell the person who I love

19:24.700 --> 19:26.300
More than anything in this world

19:26.360 --> 19:28.000
That I've just thrown away our future?

19:33.430 --> 19:35.200
Everybody out, everybody out of the new car!

19:35.260 --> 19:36.430
Out of the new car!

19:36.500 --> 19:38.430
Ted, screaming never solves anything.

19:38.500 --> 19:42.960
And so marshall finally had to tell lily what happened.

19:43.030 --> 19:44.900
I'm so sorry.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.360
I just lost it.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.300
But I can fix it.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.560
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there

19:51.630 --> 19:56.700
On my hands and knees and beg for my job back.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.600
No, you're not.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.760
What?

20:00.830 --> 20:04.960
Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment.

20:05.030 --> 20:07.560
And it's definitely not you being miserable

20:07.630 --> 20:09.030
At that horrible job.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.800
I'm just happy to have my husband back.

20:13.860 --> 20:16.530
We'll figure the rest out.

20:17.530 --> 20:19.800
I love you.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.400
I love you, too.

20:23.260 --> 20:25.860
Ultimately, they were able to make ends meet

20:25.930 --> 20:29.030
Without going bust on the apartment.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.900
You sure about this?

20:31.960 --> 20:35.300
Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?

20:36.830 --> 20:39.130
Ted, I don't think I can accept...

20:39.200 --> 20:41.100
Marshall, don't make me scream at you.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.100
Thanks a lot, buddy.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.930
You guys did it in the car, didn't...

20:50.000 --> 20:51.360
Oh, yeah!
