WEBVTT

00:15.181 --> 00:19.185
Can't remember doing this much cleaning
the last time I was in this stupid group.

00:19.978 --> 00:23.857
There better be some kind of
Mr. Miyagi-style lesson behind all this.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.567
There's not, it's just cleaning.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.444
Look on the bright side.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.030
We can always sanitize them to death.

00:30.947 --> 00:34.325
I vote we take <i>their</i> memories away,
see how they like it.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.370
Ah, but then they wouldn't know
they were being punished.

00:37.454 --> 00:38.288
True.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.291
What's wrong with gutting them like pigs
and leaving them to rot in the sun?

00:41.791 --> 00:42.625
Wow.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.543
Dude.

00:43.626 --> 00:44.878
Even I'm appalled.

00:44.961 --> 00:48.256
Yeah, Midnight is not patient.
He wants revenge, and blood.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.716
Mostly revenge.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.885
Well, Midnight's gonna have to wait.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.095
I told him that, but he keeps
pressing to be released.

00:54.512 --> 00:55.889
You need to keep him under control.

00:56.264 --> 00:57.974
We've lost our greatest asset.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.225
Our youthful optimism?

00:59.309 --> 01:00.727
-Our anonymity.
-Our anonymity.

01:01.519 --> 01:04.189
Once we retaliate, the Order is gonna know
we have our memories back.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.690
So let's just kill them all.

01:06.232 --> 01:08.485
Are you sure that's really
just Midnight talking?

01:08.568 --> 01:09.486
Yes.

01:09.569 --> 01:10.403
Mostly.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.280
I was gonna say we need an exit strategy.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.284
So until then, what?

01:16.868 --> 01:18.078
Wax on,

01:18.870 --> 01:19.704
wax off.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.375
I'm so glad this week is over.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.960
It's been so crazy around here.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.588
There were, like,
two deaths on campus this week.

01:28.671 --> 01:31.049
Yeah, some guy choked to death
in his ethics class,

01:31.132 --> 01:33.885
and another guy had a heart attack
on the concourse.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.096
Oh, free kombucha.

01:37.097 --> 01:37.972
Kombucha?

01:39.015 --> 01:40.809
I'm sorry, last one.

01:40.892 --> 01:41.726
Boo.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.561
-It's not that great.
-I'm on the phone.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.064
-Now I can't even get a free kombucha.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.108
If I get home and I find out...

01:56.032 --> 01:56.908
Hey.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.328
Hey, is he okay?
I don't know, some guy just collapsed.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.254
- What?
- Oh, my God.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.297
What the hell?

02:12.757 --> 02:13.800
Holy shit!

02:30.024 --> 02:34.028
Man, I would love to hunt down
whoever's doing that.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.363
Just be patient.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.866
I am being patient.

02:37.949 --> 02:38.992
Still talking to Midnight.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.120
I have an out-of-the-box idea.

02:42.954 --> 02:43.913
Let's stay a while.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.832
You cannot be serious.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.169
It's obvious that, as far as our training
to be Knights goes, we dropped the ball.

02:49.711 --> 02:50.670
Maybe a little.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.506
Our predecessors were
werewolves and practitioners.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.509
The more magic we learn,
the more formidable we become.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.344
It's not the worst idea on Earth.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.429
That would be Jack's.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.515
Maybe there's some kind of enchantment

03:02.599 --> 03:04.350
-to protect our memories.
-Exactly.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.730
The only thing remotely good about
that idea is that we'd be war-wolves.

03:09.814 --> 03:10.899
Warlock werewolves.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.609
See, I was thinking were-locks.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.735
They're both sexist.

03:13.818 --> 03:14.944
-Guys, shut up.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.032
-That altar should be clean already.
-We're almost done.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.533
I don't have time for "almost done."

03:20.617 --> 03:22.952
A physics student just mummified
on the main concourse.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.037
Step away from the altar.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.496
<i>Purgetur!</i>

03:32.837 --> 03:34.672
Hey, when do we learn that spell?

03:45.266 --> 03:46.643
Okay. How about this?

03:47.143 --> 03:48.186
We don't kill everyone,

03:48.853 --> 03:50.188
just everyone in charge.

03:50.271 --> 03:51.147
Great.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.525
That should create a power vacuum
that lasts for a whole 10 minutes.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.568
Lilith's right.

03:55.777 --> 04:00.073
Coventry was barely gone
before Vera went all Order 66 on us.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.158
Even if we wipe out
everyone here,

04:02.242 --> 04:04.244
we still have the other chapters
to worry about.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.329
Wait, other chapters?

04:06.412 --> 04:08.915
Yep. Four other temples in the US alone.

04:08.998 --> 04:12.543
God... Washington DC, California, Oregon,

04:12.627 --> 04:13.461
New Orleans.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.296
Then international ones.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.965
Brazil, France, Germany.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.841
Each temple averages 100 people.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.510
That's 800 people,

04:20.843 --> 04:22.553
not to mention the adepti.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.097
Of course, the "adepti".

04:24.597 --> 04:26.349
They're like the field agents
for the Order.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.309
God knows how many of those there are.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.645
Check out the big brain on Ham sandwich.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.647
Absolutely not.

04:34.148 --> 04:36.317
All right.
Maybe there's too many of them to kill.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.235
That's another thing.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.613
Nobody is killing anyone until
we track down this rogue practitioner.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.699
And kill them.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.158
Yes!

04:45.660 --> 04:46.744
Her.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.121
She's a she?

04:48.705 --> 04:49.539
Are you sure?

04:50.540 --> 04:54.294
Pretty sure I saw her when that guy in
my ethics class went all jack-o'-lantern.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.547
She was in the hallway,
chanting some incantation.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.132
What'd she look like?

04:59.549 --> 05:00.800
I didn't get a good look at her.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.220
But she was filming the magic
on her cellphone.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.764
That's not very helpful.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.350
I was in the middle of transforming,
so you get what you get.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.643
We could start with the videos.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.812
The Order probably scrubbed
the internet clean by now.

05:12.895 --> 05:14.480
I'm saying it's a start.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.899
You do realize if we go hunting
without permission,

05:16.983 --> 05:19.527
the Order will realize
we have our memories back.

05:19.610 --> 05:20.987
We can't do nothing.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.406
We're the Knights of Saint Christopher.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.241
We fight bad magic.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.369
Our priority has to be
to protect ourselves,

05:29.245 --> 05:31.289
and I found a potion that'll do that.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.877
It protects the mind
from any form of manipulation.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.545
It's complex,

05:38.212 --> 05:40.840
but if we can get our hands
on an Acheron's cauldron,

05:41.424 --> 05:42.675
I think I can brew it.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.429
Don't...

05:47.096 --> 05:47.930
swipe.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.897
Cute.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.193
You look very cute together.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.739
I asked her out before my memory returned.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.493
Of course she waits until I get it back
before she says yes,

06:08.576 --> 06:11.037
so now I have to keep up this facade.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.622
Could be worse.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.415
Listen, it could be Gabrielle.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.546
We'll track down this magic tourist.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.632
Lilith, brew the potion.

06:22.924 --> 06:23.800
Potion?

06:24.634 --> 06:27.970
You acolytes better not be practicing
unsupervised magic.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.265
Me? No. Well, no, see,

06:31.349 --> 06:34.268
what I was saying is
my tutor wants me to brew a potion,

06:34.352 --> 06:35.937
and I'm just a little nervous.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.982
And now's a good time to go.

06:40.066 --> 06:40.900
Agreed.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.200
-Ah.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.452
So...

06:51.536 --> 06:54.038
Um... Nicole-- Right.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.460
I think that Randall has a crush on you.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.629
Who wouldn't? I'm pretty damn awesome.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.590
Yeah, you are.

07:13.433 --> 07:17.228
And... also, I'm not interested in him.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.398
You're sure?

07:21.983 --> 07:22.984
Of course.

07:31.784 --> 07:32.618
Beer?

07:34.328 --> 07:35.329
Am I breathing?

07:45.256 --> 07:47.592
"Ask not...

07:47.675 --> 07:48.968
what your country can do for you.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.887
Ask what you can do for your country."

07:51.429 --> 07:53.723
What did Kennedy mean
by this little <i>bon mot?</i>

07:53.806 --> 07:55.600
He was talking about sacrifice.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.853
About putting the needs of your country
before yourself,

07:59.479 --> 08:01.105
even if it's something you don't wanna do.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.732
That's one way to look at it.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.861
Wasn't he encouraging people
to contribute to the public good?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.030
Where did you get that from?

08:10.031 --> 08:10.990
His biography.

08:11.073 --> 08:14.160
Ooh. Another textbook definition.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.661
Anyone else?

08:16.746 --> 08:18.164
Hm? Anyone?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.458
I think Kennedy was saying...

08:21.626 --> 08:22.627
Wake up.

08:25.588 --> 08:26.506
Hm?

08:27.089 --> 08:27.965
To give a shit.

08:29.133 --> 08:32.094
Not be complacent,
challenge the status quo.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.140
I don't think he was saying that.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.227
Of course you don't, you've accepted
the pablum they've spoon-fed to you.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.604
-"They"?
-They, them.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.189
The people in charge.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.691
-You mean elected officials?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.361
You don't honestly think
this is a democracy?

08:48.819 --> 08:50.071
You actually don't elect anyone.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.449
Sure, they hold their elections
and you play along,

08:54.200 --> 08:55.743
but what happens after you vote?

08:55.826 --> 08:58.287
Hm? For all you know,
they toss your ballot,

08:58.371 --> 08:59.664
flip a coin to see who wins.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.165
And you'll never know,

09:01.249 --> 09:05.753
because you wake up, you turn on CNN
and you just accept the results,

09:05.836 --> 09:08.130
and continue on your slow march
towards death,

09:08.214 --> 09:10.258
just another one
of their complacent drones.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.970
So <i>you're</i> saying
we should challenge the status quo.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.137
Whoa, hey.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.474
I'm not saying anything.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.353
I'm sure as hell not inciting anyone,

09:22.436 --> 09:23.854
and, guys, listen to me right now.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.440
I swear to God,

09:27.149 --> 09:29.277
if any of you go to the chancellor
and say otherwise,

09:29.360 --> 09:33.030
I will bury your academic standing so fast
you'll need a dowsing rod to find it.

09:38.119 --> 09:38.995
Great.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.539
Make a path, pardon me. Thank you.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.623
Thanks, Professor.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.376
Oh, don't thank me.
I'm contractually obligated to lecture.

09:45.876 --> 09:46.711
Jack.

09:46.794 --> 09:47.628
What does she want?

09:47.712 --> 09:48.546
Beats me.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.340
Hey, Alyssa.
Can I help you with something?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.217
You can leave. Now.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.928
Yes, Magistratus.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.682
So you're just gonna ignore me?

09:59.765 --> 10:01.309
I'm not supposed to know you, remember?

10:01.392 --> 10:03.102
You can acknowledge my existence.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.313
Listen, we need to talk
somewhere a little more private.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.355
Not a good idea.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.899
I can handle Gabrielle.

10:08.983 --> 10:09.817
Not that.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.694
Look, Midnight is still pissed at you.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.530
Better to stay out in public.
It's a little easier to rein him in.

10:14.905 --> 10:15.740
Okay.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.116
I need a favor.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.330
You want a favor after what you did?

10:22.913 --> 10:24.498
What I did was save your life.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.292
Twice by my count. Are going to help me,

10:26.375 --> 10:28.377
or would you rather
I pull rank on you, too, acolyte?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.754
All right, what's the favor?

10:31.130 --> 10:32.590
Vera wants me to find the...

10:33.424 --> 10:35.718
The fluff-bunny
who's been murdering students.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.678
So you want us to use our werewolf powers,

10:37.762 --> 10:39.639
the ones we're not
supposed to know we have,

10:39.722 --> 10:41.057
to find her, for you?

10:41.140 --> 10:42.850
Yeah, that's right.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.353
Okay.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.395
Great.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.730
On one condition.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.608
You've got to be kidding me.

10:50.691 --> 10:51.525
No.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.111
I need an Acheron's cauldron.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.323
What for?

10:57.406 --> 10:58.532
Nothing dangerous.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.077
Right, because
when do you do anything dangerous?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.411
Look, just get me the cauldron,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.455
and I will find you
the magic<i> </i>tourist. Deal?

11:07.249 --> 11:09.377
Meet me at the temple
after the next class.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.839
-Perfect.
-That was easy.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.188
I thought you were out hunting.

11:29.814 --> 11:33.234
Yeah, Jack's description
wasn't much help, so,

11:34.026 --> 11:36.696
-I thought I'd see if you needed anything.

11:37.738 --> 11:38.739
Uh...

11:38.823 --> 11:40.116
Probably not a good idea,

11:40.825 --> 11:42.785
in case the Order finds us together here.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.078
I made sure I wasn't followed.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.872
But if someone comes to check on us...

11:46.956 --> 11:48.958
We'd hear them long before they got here.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.214
Randall, I know why you came here.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.592
-To help you with that potion.
-To pick up where things left off.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.970
Okay, yes,
but only if you're cool with it.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.727
This sounds totally cliché,

12:08.602 --> 12:10.688
but it's not you.

12:10.771 --> 12:14.275
It's these damn memories
that were put in my fucking head.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.193
I know they're false, but...

12:16.736 --> 12:19.447
my feelings for Nicole still feel real.

12:23.075 --> 12:23.909
Yeah,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.162
totally clichéd.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.957
I think that's the plot
of a Katherine Heigl film.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.251
You're mad.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.294
Yeah, I am.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.173
But not at you.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.389
The Order came in here
and tore us all apart.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.809
They took our stuff, our home, our lives.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.437
And now Hamish wants to stay?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.522
Staying to take from them.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.191
And Hamish is right.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.567
There's a lot we can learn.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.152
Magic saved his life, remember?

12:58.235 --> 13:00.112
After it almost killed him,

13:00.196 --> 13:01.447
and Jack,

13:01.864 --> 13:02.782
and you,

13:03.324 --> 13:04.200
and me.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.454
This situation isn't permanent.

13:08.537 --> 13:09.705
What if it is?

13:11.916 --> 13:15.586
The Order took our memories
to try and change us.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.507
It kind of feels like they're succeeding.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.264
Nicole is not the Order.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.067
I hope you're right.

13:40.736 --> 13:41.570
Stay.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.281
Help me with the potion.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.451
I can't. I have to find
a woman with a cell phone.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.219
Uh...

14:05.302 --> 14:07.388
It's the only way
to get you past the security.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.432
Vera calls this the fear corridor.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.060
Why?

14:14.228 --> 14:16.647
Are there secret traps or...

14:17.606 --> 14:19.400
-do those corpses come to life?
-Hey! Come on.

14:19.817 --> 14:20.651
You can tell me.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.194
I actually can't.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.447
The enchantment prevents me
from answering stupid questions.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.116
You're making that up.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.034
Shut up.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.454
We're here.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.375
Holy shit.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.128
What is all this stuff?

14:40.087 --> 14:42.089
This is the beating heart of the Order.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.176
The culmination of centuries of study
and exploration.

14:46.260 --> 14:49.972
It's the single largest collection
of magic grimoires and artifacts

14:50.055 --> 14:51.307
ever amassed.

14:52.516 --> 14:55.603
This room holds the stuff of legends.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.272
It practically resonates with pure magic.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.443
Whoa, that's a Zoltar fortune teller.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.029
Not just any Zoltar.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.614
It's an enchanted Zoltar.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.033
He makes your wishes come true.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.494
I wish I knew my major.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.163
Uh...  Careful.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.415
This one's a bit of a trickster.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.834
He grants your wishes ironically.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.836
Yeah.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.296
Uh, now wait here.

15:22.630 --> 15:27.384
Don't move, and just don't touch anything.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.448
-I said don't touch anything!

15:49.531 --> 15:50.449
I didn't.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.630
You got to be kidding me.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.821
Silverback.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.074
You all right, buddy?

16:33.450 --> 16:35.452
Whatever you're doing, stop it.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.454
I'm rescuing Silverback.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.289
I said stop it!
That's not part of the deal.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.749
Well, the deal has changed.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.919
If Vera finds out that hide is missing,
we'll be in a lot of trouble.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.462
Then make sure she doesn't find out,

16:45.546 --> 16:47.464
because I'm not leaving him
behind enemy lines.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.133
Enemy lines?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.760
God, you are such a hypocrite!

16:51.844 --> 16:54.346
I have no right to be mad
after you lie about being a werewolf,

16:54.430 --> 16:56.974
but God forbid I use <i>pulveris memoria</i>
to save your life.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.183
You weren't saving my life.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.811
You were buying your way
back into Vera's good books.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.605
Look, if you would just pick a side
instead of flip-flopping between

17:03.689 --> 17:06.108
-the Knights and the Order--
-I was always on the Order's side.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.234
Then why save Randall?

17:08.110 --> 17:08.986
Why stop Edward?

17:09.069 --> 17:10.070
I did that for you!

17:12.031 --> 17:12.906
What do you mean?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.041
-Silverback?

17:22.875 --> 17:23.751
Midnight?

17:25.335 --> 17:26.503
I have to tell you,

17:26.587 --> 17:28.380
as far as internal struggle goes,

17:28.464 --> 17:30.257
I've seen subtler metaphors.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.259
-Professor Clarke.
-In the flesh.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.386
Well, not the flesh.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.055
Oh.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.973
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.101
You're in a place where
dreams and memories collide.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.604
A realm where the past,
present, and future coexist.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.064
The collective unconscious.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.815
I know, I have been here before.

17:47.983 --> 17:48.942
Why am I here this time?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.944
So you don't have all the answers.
Interesting.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.574
Jack, you got a big life decision
ahead of you.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.577
This again?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.080
No, I've done this already.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.167
I do not want to die.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.797
Yeah, yeah, you're still here.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.798
So I'm not dying?

18:10.881 --> 18:13.383
You're dying, but whether or not
you want to live doesn't matter.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.137
This is because of Silverback?

18:17.221 --> 18:19.014
Two werewolf spirits, one body.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.519
Nobody can survive that for very long.

18:23.602 --> 18:24.645
So I have to choose.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.731
Sure, try that.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.151
Silverback.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.779
Okay, then. Midnight!

18:36.240 --> 18:38.283
Not as easy as you thought
it was gonna be, huh?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.786
If I can figure out my major,
I can figure this out.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.747
Please, you just asked
the Enchanted Zoltar for help.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.542
I mean, Amir and I have a bet going
that you'll never figure it out.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.669
-Okay, I get it.
-'Cause last year, it was philosophy

18:48.752 --> 18:49.586
or engineering.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.630
This year it's political science
or communications.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.257
You know what? I'm gonna figure it out.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.174
Jack.

18:55.759 --> 18:56.718
Are you okay?

18:57.845 --> 18:58.887
Yeah. Uh...

18:59.847 --> 19:01.056
How long was I out?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.142
Um, a couple of seconds.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.853
Okay, whoa, don't move. You should rest.

19:06.436 --> 19:07.271
No time.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.316
Thanks for this.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.113
Find that tourist.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.202
Guys,

19:22.286 --> 19:23.328
something's happened.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.580
Ooh, shiny.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.415
Hey, you got the cauldron already.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.916
Yeah, I made a deal with Alyssa.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.169
She gives us the cauldron,
and we hunt down the tourist.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.253
Smart.

19:31.336 --> 19:32.421
Now we have an alibi.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.882
Yeah, great. Uh, look,
I got to tell you guys something.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.092
What's so great about
an Acheron's cauldron anyway?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.385
-Guys.
-According to legend,

19:38.468 --> 19:41.346
it's been carried to the afterlife
and sterilized in the river Acheron,

19:41.430 --> 19:43.056
making it the purest surface possible

19:43.140 --> 19:44.850
-for creating potions.
-Yeah, guys, look. I--

19:44.933 --> 19:45.976
Somebody's been studying.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.604
What did I tell you? We have
to take advantage of this opportunity.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.647
Guys, will you shut up
and listen to me?

19:51.064 --> 19:51.899
Wow.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.984
Midnight's extra bitchy today.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.861
No, it's not Midnight, not anymore.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.530
All right, Alyssa took me down
to this giant vault.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.824
All of our shit is down there,
including our lockers.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.701
Silverback was there,
and I tried to take him.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.037
So now you have two hides in you?

20:05.621 --> 20:06.622
Yeah, I do.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.081
Oh, shit, I was kidding.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.250
Dude, you totally have to transform.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.879
What if you become some kick-ass,
two-headed war-wolf?

20:13.962 --> 20:14.880
Were-lock.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.673
They're both sexist.

20:16.882 --> 20:17.716
I don't know.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.510
I don't know.
I was back in the collective unconscious,

20:20.594 --> 20:23.055
and Professor Clarke said
that these two hides are killing me.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.682
Did he say transforming was a bad idea?

20:28.018 --> 20:28.894
No.

20:29.937 --> 20:30.979
So give it a shot.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.106
-Do it.
-Do it.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.024
-Do it.
-Do it.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.817
-Do it.
-Do it.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.570
Do it! Do it! Do it!

20:38.654 --> 20:41.490
Do it! Do it! Do it!

20:41.573 --> 20:44.201
Do it! Do it! Do it!

20:46.245 --> 20:47.287
Aw, damn it.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.748
By the way, I totally forgot to tell you.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.292
Don't transform.
It'll only accelerate your death.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.418
Thanks for the intel.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.505
As soon as you answer the question,
you can take care of this little problem.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.674
Yeah, still trying to figure out
what that question is.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.134
You know the question.
You just don't know you know it yet.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.970
Cryptic. That's great.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.097
If I know it, can't you just tell me?

21:05.180 --> 21:07.808
There's a difference between knowing
and understanding, Jack.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.061
So are all of our conversations
gonna be annoyingly elliptical riddles?

21:11.144 --> 21:12.771
Don't come back until you're ready.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.358
At least you figured out how to get here.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.194
See? Told you.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.613
He's not dead.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.657
But no transformation.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.660
Too bad. A two-headed werewolf
would have been sick.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.371
Guys, I gotta figure out a way
to ditch one of these hides.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.372
Easy.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.040
Without actually dying.

21:32.874 --> 21:34.710
Well, if you want to be finicky about it.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.461
We'll figure something out.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.462
In the meantime...

21:38.505 --> 21:39.339
we hunt.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.895
Remind me, was the job I gave you
to drink beer and review history notes?

21:55.397 --> 21:58.025
No, you wanted me to find
your fluff-bunny for you.

21:58.483 --> 22:01.069
You know, technically, I paid for you
to find that fluff-bunny.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.363
Oh, go ahead, help yourself.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.783
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought it was
Do Whatever You Want Day.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.801
So, this magic tourist of yours...

22:24.885 --> 22:25.886
She have a name?

22:26.470 --> 22:27.387
Quiet.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.267
Probably.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.353
You know what she looks like?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.022
No.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.441
So, where do you propose we start?

22:41.109 --> 22:41.943
That's...

22:42.361 --> 22:43.820
That's your job.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.906
We don't know the answer
to those questions, either.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.409
Guess we'll just wait for her
to strike again.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.994
That's a terrible plan.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.746
Someone else is gonna get hurt.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.456
Possibly killed.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.876
Yeah. That is the downside
to being a magic cop.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.423
Anything else I can help you with?

23:07.469 --> 23:09.471
When am I getting the other thing back?

23:09.930 --> 23:11.890
As soon as we're done with it.
Should be soon.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.814
And the other...

23:20.649 --> 23:21.817
other thing?

23:22.859 --> 23:24.403
That's a little more complex.

23:28.031 --> 23:28.865
But you...

23:30.534 --> 23:31.618
You're working on it?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.328
Look, you should leave, okay?

23:33.829 --> 23:36.164
We're not supposed to know each other,
remember?

23:38.041 --> 23:39.376
Because I do, finally.

23:46.675 --> 23:51.680
You know, this whole
"pretending I don't know you" thing...

23:53.348 --> 23:56.309
It just keeps getting easier and easier.

24:17.581 --> 24:20.041
<i>Basc chun báis.</i>

24:35.849 --> 24:37.309
Third time's the charm.

24:42.772 --> 24:45.275
<i>Basc chun báis.</i>

25:25.732 --> 25:26.733
She was right here.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.154
Maybe she knows how to teleport.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.045
Warn your friends,

25:47.337 --> 25:48.547
and I'll end you.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.466
Look, I just want to talk.

25:51.841 --> 25:52.676
I don't.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.014
If I don't reply, they're gonna know
there's a problem.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.600
Type it and show it to me.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.237
Send it.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.241
Drop it.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.372
"Eleanor Taylor." Now we have a name.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.001
And her magic.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.627
Hamish, take a look at this.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.047
Hamish.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.937
The spells you're learning
are very dangerous.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.522
That's why I'm learning them.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.940
You're hurting people.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.359
Then you better not mess with me.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.277
I get it.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.072
Magic can be intoxicating,
but in the wrong hands--

26:56.156 --> 26:57.198
The wrong hands?

26:57.282 --> 26:58.992
So who gets to decide?

26:59.909 --> 27:00.744
You?

27:01.745 --> 27:03.747
-Actually, yeah.
-Why?

27:05.248 --> 27:07.459
What gives you that right?

27:08.752 --> 27:09.669
Honestly...

27:10.879 --> 27:12.464
just the way things shook out.

27:12.547 --> 27:15.342
Some people become dentists,
others become magic cops.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.135
Don't make fun of me.

27:17.218 --> 27:18.261
I'm not.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.306
She recorded everything.

27:21.389 --> 27:22.932
Magic snuff films.

27:23.558 --> 27:24.392
Great.

27:25.518 --> 27:28.938
I have as much right to learn magic
as you do.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.315
I'm smarter than you.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.776
I'm more qualified than you.

27:32.859 --> 27:33.735
You're right, you do.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.613
But you also have a responsibility
to learn it properly.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.616
Maybe not kill so many people.

27:42.994 --> 27:43.912
Yeah.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.207
Too late for that.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.335
If you hurry,
you might be able to save them.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.007
- Guys!

27:56.091 --> 27:57.092
Guys, get out!

27:57.425 --> 27:58.259
Move!

28:00.929 --> 28:02.138
It's--

28:03.139 --> 28:03.973
It's a trap!

28:04.516 --> 28:05.350
You're back.

28:06.726 --> 28:07.686
Aw, damn it.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.896
But not because
you figured out the question.

28:09.979 --> 28:13.400
All right. Professor, I'm a little busy
for metaphysical <i>Jeopardy!</i> right now.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.527
Well, then you better answer the question.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.237
Fine.

28:17.946 --> 28:18.780
Midnight.

28:19.864 --> 28:20.699
Wrong.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.742
I gave you an answer.

28:23.827 --> 28:24.911
To the wrong question.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.038
Oh, my God, I'm so glad that I killed you.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.832
-No, you're not.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.335
You know how I know that?
You leave flowers at my grave.

28:33.128 --> 28:36.756
What kind of an idiot leaves flowers
at an unmarked grave?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.633
Jack, you're practically begging
to get caught.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.593
Why are you mocking me for that?
It's your grave.

28:41.094 --> 28:41.928
Jack....

28:42.262 --> 28:43.388
Don't worry about me.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.268
I'm already dead.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.520
Worry about the living.

28:50.603 --> 28:52.230
Wait, is that a hint?

29:00.947 --> 29:02.115
You guys okay?

29:02.615 --> 29:03.616
Yeah.

29:04.242 --> 29:05.076
You?

29:06.244 --> 29:08.496
I'd be a lot happier if I just caught her.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.707
At least now we know
who we're looking for.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.293
This would all be a non-issue
if I could've just wolfed out.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.672
Even if you could, you shouldn't. We can't
risk anyone on campus seeing a werewolf.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.048
The Order would be all over us.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.676
<i>Werewolf on Campus.</i>
I'd totally watch that show.

29:22.135 --> 29:22.969
Come on.

29:24.387 --> 29:28.933
Okay. It seems like Ellie Taylor was
a rising star in the theology department,

29:29.309 --> 29:31.561
and then all of a sudden she's expelled.

29:31.644 --> 29:36.274
There are insinuations that she "borrowed"
some book without permission.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.943
Ten bucks says that missing book
is this grimoire.

29:39.027 --> 29:42.197
So Ellie finds an actual grimoire
and decides to give magic a whirl.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.949
Explains how she's doing magic,
but not why.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.868
What about her victims?

29:46.951 --> 29:48.077
Any connections there?

29:48.161 --> 29:50.789
Uh, nope, it doesn't look like
she knew any of them.

29:50.872 --> 29:53.666
So we have a magic serial killer
on our hands.

29:54.083 --> 29:57.003
I will give her props
for changing the narrative on her victims.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.798
It's refreshing not to be the target
for a change.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.883
And there's more to it,
the way she was talking.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.260
She's not just a straight-up psycho.
She has an agenda.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.553
How can you tell?

30:06.221 --> 30:07.055
Because...

30:07.639 --> 30:08.515
she sounded like me.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.475
I'm with Ham radio.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.060
Don't ever say that again.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.145
She's a magic serial killer.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.857
There's even a video scrapbook
of her greatest hits.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.403
I guess we should tell Alyssa
what we found out.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.156
And let the Order catch her? Hell, no.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.826
How about we take this potion,

30:27.909 --> 30:30.829
say, "Fuck the Order,"
and keep this hunt to ourselves?

30:33.873 --> 30:35.542
-I like that idea more.
- Me, too.

30:39.712 --> 30:40.672
Okay.

30:46.636 --> 30:49.389
<i>Conserventur cogitationes meae.</i>

30:52.851 --> 30:54.686
So, how does this work anyway?

30:55.395 --> 30:56.896
It helps you remember everything,

30:56.980 --> 31:00.066
even things you've forgotten naturally,
and locks them in place.

31:00.149 --> 31:02.151
And the false memories the Order gave us?

31:02.235 --> 31:03.486
What happens to them?

31:04.529 --> 31:05.405
I don't know.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.240
Well...

31:07.699 --> 31:11.244
And drink it all at once, or your brain
will shrivel up to the size of a raisin.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.579
-It'll what?
-Bottoms up.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.797
My high school locker combination
was 21-59-37!

31:24.299 --> 31:26.467
I was afraid of turtles when I was two!

31:26.843 --> 31:29.262
I lost my retainer
at Darryl Hornby's house! Darryl!

31:29.345 --> 31:31.806
Gabrielle made me get a tattoo!

31:33.099 --> 31:34.934
"Prime beef"? What is this?

31:40.440 --> 31:41.691
At least it's accurate.

31:44.819 --> 31:45.695
Wow.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.197
That was intense.

31:48.281 --> 31:49.157
Whoa.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.325
But worth it.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.161
I never want to forget you guys.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.954
-Me neither, buddy.
-Aww.

31:57.916 --> 31:58.750
Really?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.168
You're joking.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.171
He says that, and you're all over him.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.341
I give one toast about family
and I'm an after-school special.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.967
Well, yeah, he's Randall.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.094
That's true.

32:12.722 --> 32:13.848
That could be Ellie.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.351
It could also be the Order.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.436
That's a good point.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.397
Look, we assumed
Ellie's first magic attack

32:21.481 --> 32:22.941
was that day in my Ethics class,

32:23.024 --> 32:25.234
but maybe there was
more attacks before that.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.825
And that day we almost transformed...

32:34.118 --> 32:35.453
I was over there.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.539
The ringing sound came from...

32:39.666 --> 32:40.833
that direction.

32:41.793 --> 32:42.835
-Same.
-Yep.

32:43.586 --> 32:44.462
Let's go.

32:51.260 --> 32:53.346
Ellie's scent is weak, but it's here.

32:54.430 --> 32:56.140
Smells like blood.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.392
Making me hungry.

32:58.351 --> 32:59.769
What? I skipped lunch.

32:59.852 --> 33:00.687
Here.

33:14.742 --> 33:16.494
Trevor Burstyn?

33:17.078 --> 33:19.789
Come on, "Burstyn"?

33:23.209 --> 33:24.043
Like...

33:24.627 --> 33:25.753
-"burstin'"?
-I know.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.671
I know.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.965
He was a neophyte with Alyssa and me,

33:29.048 --> 33:30.550
but he got washed out.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.099
Am I in the wall?

33:38.641 --> 33:39.475
Trevor,

33:40.268 --> 33:41.144
it's Lilith.

33:41.227 --> 33:42.103
Remember me?

33:43.438 --> 33:44.355
I am...

33:45.440 --> 33:46.524
in the wall.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.693
Did Ellie Taylor do this to?

33:50.111 --> 33:51.487
I haven't seen her since...

33:53.072 --> 33:53.990
freshman year.

33:55.116 --> 33:58.745
She said I stole her blue rose.

34:01.998 --> 34:02.832
Please.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.625
The pain.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.378
Make it stop.

34:08.087 --> 34:10.048
I don't know any magic that'll cure this.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.632
Well, we've gotta do something.

34:14.594 --> 34:19.807
<i>-Sanetur! Reparetur! Restituatur!</i>

34:19.891 --> 34:21.726
-It's not working.
-Yeah, you think?

34:23.102 --> 34:24.145
Stop!

34:41.412 --> 34:42.246
Poor guy.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.707
Didn't get in,

34:44.791 --> 34:46.793
and magic still killed him.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.377
Why attack a wash-out?

34:48.461 --> 34:50.505
Because she didn't know he was a wash-out.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.174
Neither did he. They powdered him
after they sent him packing.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.426
Ellie doesn't know that, either.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.221
Any denial would have
sounded like a cover-up.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.599
She attacks someone
she thinks is in the Order,

35:01.682 --> 35:03.768
and then goes after
a bunch of random civilians?

35:03.851 --> 35:05.520
It doesn't make sense.

35:06.354 --> 35:07.688
Actually, it does.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.609
Her videos... You could see
Order members in each shot.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.737
So she's trying to flush out
Order members?

35:14.821 --> 35:17.281
But why does she want to identify us?

35:17.615 --> 35:19.158
She doesn't, she wants the Order.

35:19.742 --> 35:21.244
Yeah, that's us.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.079
-Ah, right.
- Guys,

35:23.162 --> 35:24.789
-focus.
-Okay.

35:25.748 --> 35:28.751
She said she accused him
of stealing her blue rose.

35:29.043 --> 35:32.338
She knows the Order exists
and she blames them for not getting in.

35:32.421 --> 35:33.756
She's out for revenge.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.842
Okay, now we need to warn Alyssa.

35:44.934 --> 35:46.018
Alyssa, it's Jack.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.938
No, I'm not calling to argue.

35:52.191 --> 35:53.234
Thank you.

35:58.823 --> 35:59.657
Hey.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.871
Try and look a little more disappointed.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.372
Sorry.

36:06.622 --> 36:07.874
I was hoping for someone else.

36:08.666 --> 36:09.500
Your werewolf.

36:10.751 --> 36:11.961
She's not my wolf.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.088
She's... She's her own person.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.257
Whatever.

36:18.134 --> 36:18.968
So.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.096
How long have you slept with the enemy?

36:24.932 --> 36:26.267
We're not sleeping together.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.896
We're dating,
but we didn't want anyone to know.

36:33.232 --> 36:34.567
I'm a psychology major.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.944
Do you want to be a psychologist?

36:37.028 --> 36:37.862
Gross.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.616
Who wants to sit around
and listen to people whine all day?

36:41.824 --> 36:44.368
I'm learning how to identify
my opponents' weaknesses.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.370
Your opponents?

36:48.539 --> 36:49.707
Which opponents?

36:50.750 --> 36:51.667
All of them.

36:52.043 --> 36:52.877
All of them.

36:55.713 --> 36:56.547
And trust me,

36:57.340 --> 36:59.300
you'll want to get over
your Stockholm syndrome

36:59.383 --> 37:00.676
sooner rather than later.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.511
If Lilith finds out what you did to her,

37:02.970 --> 37:04.055
she'll rip your throat out.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.307
I love that top.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.274
Bye.

37:23.699 --> 37:26.285
She's a disgruntled wannabe
with an axe to grind

37:26.369 --> 37:28.496
against the secret society
that rejected her?

37:28.579 --> 37:31.415
Yeah, and she's been using magic
to identify members.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.459
She sounds like a female you.

37:33.542 --> 37:34.377
I know.

37:34.710 --> 37:35.628
That was a joke.

37:35.711 --> 37:36.921
It's kind of true.

37:37.546 --> 37:38.506
Kind of.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.383
Okay. So now what?

37:40.466 --> 37:43.594
Now we find Ellie Taylor before
she blasts anyone else through a wall.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.137
And we will, but you...

37:46.347 --> 37:47.515
You need to stand down.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.599
You look terrible.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.185
It's that other hide, isn't it?

37:51.936 --> 37:53.521
They're fighting for dominance.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.856
You're in no condition to keep going.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.024
I don't have a choice.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.443
The others are scouring campus,
and I'm gonna go join them.

37:59.527 --> 38:00.945
That's an order, acolyte.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.031
Hold that thought, Magistratus.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.783
That's her behind Gabrielle.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.619
She's leading her right to the temple.

38:13.332 --> 38:14.208
Come on!

38:39.317 --> 38:40.192
Get the others.

38:52.913 --> 38:55.666
Did you really think you could sneak up on

38:56.083 --> 38:57.585
Gabrielle Dupres?

38:58.794 --> 39:00.421
I thought you said
she was right behind me.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.547
She was right behind you.

39:01.630 --> 39:02.673
Then why did she bail?

39:03.841 --> 39:05.176
'Cause you're not the target.

39:05.634 --> 39:06.510
I am.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.143
<i>Basc chun báis!</i>

39:23.027 --> 39:23.903
That's bad.

39:27.990 --> 39:28.866
Where are the Knights?

39:31.452 --> 39:32.703
Somewhere in the forest...

39:33.954 --> 39:35.498
looking about as good as you right now.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.291
You need to hurry...

39:38.250 --> 39:39.960
unless you want to spend
the rest of eternity

39:40.419 --> 39:41.837
debating ethical theories with me.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.047
Oh, God, no.

39:49.887 --> 39:50.846
Silverback.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.014
And the question?

39:52.765 --> 39:54.600
What kind of person do I want to be?

39:59.021 --> 40:00.773
Why Silverback?

40:03.067 --> 40:05.111
'Cause I want the strength
of a wolf and...

40:05.903 --> 40:06.987
the mercy of a human.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.447
Hm.

40:14.537 --> 40:15.538
I got it right.

40:16.539 --> 40:17.873
There was no wrong answer, Jack.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.543
-You got to be kidding me.
-But there's also no quick fix.

40:20.626 --> 40:24.004
There are only informed
and uninformed decisions.

40:25.005 --> 40:26.590
Your urge for revenge,

40:26.674 --> 40:28.008
that isn't all Midnight.

40:29.051 --> 40:29.885
Yeah.

40:31.637 --> 40:32.471
I know.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.558
Is that why you're here instead of Pete?

40:36.016 --> 40:36.851
Yes.

40:37.935 --> 40:41.272
I am here to guide you
on your spiritual journey

40:41.355 --> 40:43.274
-towards self-enlightenment.
-You are?

40:43.357 --> 40:44.191
No.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.652
God, get over yourself. Go live a little.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.821
You've got the rest of eternity
for navel-gazing.

40:48.904 --> 40:51.115
What am I telling you for?
You'll find out soon enough.

40:51.198 --> 40:52.825
Hey, look me up when you're back.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.285
We'll go check out the dinosaurs.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.580
What do you mean, when I'm back?

41:00.124 --> 41:01.000
Oh, shit.

41:01.083 --> 41:02.084
<i>Las</i>

41:02.418 --> 41:03.252
<i>an</i>

41:03.627 --> 41:05.588
<i>-dorcha--</i>
<i>-Desiste quod facias!</i>

41:19.435 --> 41:20.269
So...

41:21.145 --> 41:22.438
you're back in Silverback.

41:22.855 --> 41:23.689
I am.

41:23.772 --> 41:26.358
How Jack got his Silverback.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.526
Stop.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.529
I have to admit, I half expected
Midnight to take you with him.

41:30.613 --> 41:31.947
That reminds me, you owe me $20.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.325
Silverback by popular demand.

41:34.408 --> 41:35.242
Okay.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.205
Whoa, you guys bet
on whether I would live or die?

41:39.288 --> 41:41.582
I bet you'd live because I believe in you.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.376
Johann Sebastian Silver-Bach.

41:45.628 --> 41:46.504
Hamish.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.799
And I bet against you 'cause I'm a cynic.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.843
<i>Silverback to the Future.</i>

41:53.552 --> 41:55.179
You are such an idiot.

41:56.013 --> 41:56.972
How do you do it?

41:58.974 --> 42:00.976
How do you kill someone and not...

42:01.977 --> 42:02.811
care?

42:03.812 --> 42:04.647
We care.

42:06.148 --> 42:07.024
No, I...

42:09.818 --> 42:11.111
I want your advice.

42:15.616 --> 42:16.700
Well.

42:16.951 --> 42:20.829
I certainly hope that was the last
<i>respondeo</i> I have to do for a while.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.248
Miss Drake.

42:22.331 --> 42:24.083
Congratulations are in order.

42:24.166 --> 42:27.211
It was unfortunate you were forced
to dispatch with our suspect

42:27.294 --> 42:28.963
before we could question her motives,

42:29.046 --> 42:31.840
but the situation is resolved.

42:31.924 --> 42:32.967
Thank you, Grand Magus.

42:33.050 --> 42:34.885
And as for you four...

42:36.387 --> 42:37.555
Well, you can clean that up.

42:55.656 --> 42:56.490
Alyssa, wait.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.710
I just wanted to let you know
that we are

43:08.419 --> 43:09.587
done with the cauldron.

43:10.921 --> 43:13.882
And that other, other thing
is taken care of, too.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.845
Yeah. Great.

43:18.846 --> 43:19.722
Hey, wait.

43:26.061 --> 43:27.605
I also wanted to thank you...

43:29.940 --> 43:31.317
for saving my life.

43:33.652 --> 43:34.528
I owe you one.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.285
By my count, you owe me three.

43:43.120 --> 43:43.996
You're right.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.668
And if I hadn't been so busy...

43:51.712 --> 43:54.214
trying to be angry at everyone,

43:54.590 --> 43:56.383
I would have realized that a lot sooner.

43:58.510 --> 43:59.720
So thank you. Thank you.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.472
I'm sorry.

44:03.140 --> 44:03.974
For what?

44:04.516 --> 44:07.853
Your irrational anger
or your pious indignation?

44:08.270 --> 44:10.189
After what you did to Ellie, both.

44:15.319 --> 44:16.987
Oh, shit. My-- Too soon?

44:17.946 --> 44:19.948
I just didn't expect you
to do something like that...

44:21.450 --> 44:23.452
for me, especially how I've been acting.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.787
I didn't do that for you.

44:25.162 --> 44:26.413
Okay, I deserve that.

44:26.497 --> 44:27.373
No, I--

44:31.126 --> 44:32.795
I didn't plan to murder anyone.

44:35.589 --> 44:36.465
That spell...

44:37.424 --> 44:38.509
malfunctioned.

44:39.635 --> 44:43.472
Like every other spell or incantation
or potion I've tried lately.

44:44.431 --> 44:46.475
There's something really wrong
with my magic.

44:51.438 --> 44:52.898
There's something wrong with me.

44:54.149 --> 44:55.943
-Hey...
-No. No.
