WEBVTT

00:10.510 --> 00:12.410
Yes!

00:12.450 --> 00:14.880
You're going down like a wampa
in a heat wave, Zander!

00:14.920 --> 00:16.850
Hey! Kordi,
what are you doing?

00:16.880 --> 00:18.840
Looking for loose credits.

00:18.890 --> 00:21.690
- You see our last profit statement?
- No.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.650
That's 'cause we don't have one.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.630
Business is poor, and so are we.

00:26.660 --> 00:30.800
<i>And don't forget, the
rent is due any day now.</i>

00:30.830 --> 00:33.690
Wha... How did you know
we were talking about money?

00:33.730 --> 00:36.500
<i>Oh, I got a sense
for these things.</i>

00:36.540 --> 00:38.440
<i>Call it a gift.</i>

00:38.470 --> 00:40.630
Ow!

00:40.670 --> 00:43.470
Relax. I'm sure
something will come in.

00:43.510 --> 00:44.880
Yeah?

00:47.480 --> 00:48.910
See? I was due.

00:52.490 --> 00:54.890
Welcome to Freemaker
Salvage and Repair.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.750
- I'm Kordi Freemaker... -I do
not care for pleasantries.

00:58.790 --> 01:03.590
I am Ignacio Wortan
of the Core World Wortans.

01:03.630 --> 01:05.670
I have recently acquired
a top-of-the-line...

01:05.700 --> 01:08.470
Oh! Aavman Luxury 2800
space yacht.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.870
Dual sublight ion jet pods, bantha leather
upholstered seats and premium everything.

01:12.910 --> 01:16.450
Indeed, everything is premium
save for the dashboard,

01:16.480 --> 01:19.850
which is unacceptably plain.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.420
I want to replace it with one made from
genuine Wookiee-carved Wroshyr wood.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.710
Which is why I came to you.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.650
You heard custom jobs
are our specialty?

01:29.690 --> 01:32.800
No. Because every other shop
turned me down.

01:32.830 --> 01:37.530
You see, Wroshyr wood
is only found on Kashyyyk.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.590
And Kashyyyk is under
a massive Imperial blockade.

01:44.570 --> 01:47.630
Which isn't a problem at all!

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.720 --> 02:01.590
Going to Kashyyyk? How are
we gonna pull that off?

02:01.620 --> 02:04.450
Even if we got through the
blockade... Which we will.

02:04.490 --> 02:07.550
Even if, Wookiees don't
exactly welcome outsiders.

02:07.590 --> 02:11.520
Tell me about it. I lost a lot
of good friends on Kashyyyk.

02:11.570 --> 02:15.770
And arms. Wookiees love
to rip off arms.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.830
Look, everybody knows the best way
to endear yourself to a Wookiee

02:18.870 --> 02:20.800
is to speak Wookiee.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.840
Right.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.650
That was Wookiee
for "I speak Wookiee."

02:25.680 --> 02:27.826
What? I learned it from that
Wookiee spacer last cycle.

02:27.850 --> 02:30.620
Rowan, he was here for a day.
I know!

02:30.650 --> 02:32.620
- That's how fast I learn!
- Hmm.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.710
What time does
Rent-a-Droid open?

02:37.590 --> 02:39.620
Ah, a translator, huh?

02:39.660 --> 02:42.560
Well, what you need
is a RA-7 protocol droid.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.530
Fluent in six million languages.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.430
Oh, this baby'll talk
the ears off a gundark.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.910
That means "Save your credits.
I speak Wookiee!"

02:52.940 --> 02:56.750
Actually, you just said, "Shave your tummy.
I'll eat a cookie."

02:56.780 --> 02:58.780
Hmm. We'll take it. How much?

02:58.810 --> 03:00.740
30,000.

03:00.780 --> 03:05.750
Ah, what are you gonna do? Get a free
translation program from the HoloNet?

03:05.790 --> 03:07.620
Hmm.

03:13.690 --> 03:16.690
Separation complete.
Let's get to work.

03:16.730 --> 03:20.500
- What do you mean, you can't train today?
- We're going to Kashyyyk.

03:20.530 --> 03:24.530
But, Rowan, the hunt for the Kyber Saber
crystals has galactic implications.

03:24.570 --> 03:28.400
I know, Naare. But I'm the only one
on the crew who speaks Wookiee.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.400
Not for long.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.840
I have a bad feeling about this.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.750
It'll be free...
I mean, fine.

03:35.820 --> 03:37.750
Once I get this translator
program installed,

03:37.780 --> 03:39.850
you'll be talking
like a Kashyyyk native.

03:39.890 --> 03:42.790
You say that like I want that.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.780
Trust me,
this is a brilliant plan.

03:45.830 --> 03:50.570
I mean, look, we've even got a brilliant
disguise to get past the blockade.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.570
I give you an Imperial shuttle.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.530
I have a bad feeling about this.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.440
No, you don't!

04:01.540 --> 04:05.370
Lieutenant Commander Durpin,
I have a status report.

04:05.450 --> 04:08.380
Nothing is happening.
Anywhere. At all.

04:08.420 --> 04:10.790
Which is just how I like it,
Lieutenant Plumestriker.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.460
If nothing happens,
then nothing can go wrong.

04:13.490 --> 04:16.390
But... how will we
ever get promoted?

04:16.420 --> 04:19.720
Promoted? First rule
of Imperial officer survival...

04:19.760 --> 04:21.630
Do nothing.

04:21.660 --> 04:25.590
Why do you think I let the Trandoshans
run our prison down there on Kashyyyk?

04:27.570 --> 04:31.670
They take all the risks, and I get
to keep my head and neck down.

04:31.710 --> 04:34.640
Sir, a shuttle is entering
the sector from hyperspace.

04:34.670 --> 04:38.540
Ow! My neck.

04:38.580 --> 04:42.580
We'll be smack dab in the middle of
that Imperial blockade any minute now.

04:42.620 --> 04:45.850
- This is so gonna work. -Kordi,
just what makes you think that?

04:45.890 --> 04:48.860
Iggy Wortan's case o'
credits, that's what.

04:48.890 --> 04:53.700
Well, let's find out. Coming
out of hyperspace... now.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.070
Uh-oh.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.670
That's no shuttle. Someone's trying
to sneak through our blockade!

05:03.700 --> 05:07.600
Launch TIE fighters! I don't want
my nothing to become a something.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.830
If we turn around right now, I can
get us out of here. Case o' credits!

05:46.610 --> 05:47.710
Pull up!
Pull up!

05:47.750 --> 05:50.590
Aaah!

06:05.530 --> 06:07.430
Nice flying, Sis.

06:07.470 --> 06:11.440
I can do anything... when a
case of credits is on the line.

06:11.470 --> 06:14.800
The TIE fighters lost them. We'll
have to go down to the surface.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.840
I'll order
a stormtrooper away team.

06:16.880 --> 06:21.780
Stormtroopers? Ah. No, the less
people know about this, the better.

06:21.820 --> 06:24.720
Nobody saw nothin'!

06:24.750 --> 06:28.680
We shall find these
whoever-they-ares ourselves.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.680
Ah, I love it
when you lead, sir.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.590
I'm not leading!

06:34.660 --> 06:36.590
What a beautiful planet.

06:40.670 --> 06:42.600
We're gonna die!
Wow!

06:42.640 --> 06:45.410
Roger! Get over there
and translate.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.880
Can I say, perhaps for the last
time ever, that this is a bad idea?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.780
Puh-lease!
You're a people person.

06:52.810 --> 06:56.810
They're Wookiees, not people,
and I'm a droid, not a person.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.820
Point is they're going
to love you.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.710
Everyone does.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.660
True. Okay. I'll try.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.550
Atta-droid!

07:10.560 --> 07:14.630
I hate to be the droid
who says I told you so.

07:14.670 --> 07:16.610
At least it wasn't
your arms, right?

07:23.580 --> 07:26.250
No... sudden... movements.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.480
- Wookiees can smell fear.
- Yep. That's fear.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.490
Run, Rowan!

07:36.160 --> 07:38.130
Rowan, no!
Hang on.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.300
Well, snap my bricks. I think he
might actually be pulling this off.

07:48.330 --> 07:51.260
Well, yes, but he's not...

07:51.300 --> 07:53.230
Shh, shh, shh.
Let him negotiate.

07:58.340 --> 08:00.270
He's giving us the wood for free!
Yes!

08:00.310 --> 08:02.240
Free is my favorite price!

08:05.290 --> 08:09.520
One paw-carved, soon-to-be-dashboard
piece of Wroshyr wood.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.490
Now let's blow this planet before
the Empire tracks us down.

08:12.530 --> 08:15.530
Uh, guys? I don't think
that wood was free.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.390
See?

08:19.530 --> 08:22.390
When you accepted the wood,
you agreed to free

08:22.440 --> 08:24.510
Chief Attiburra's child,
Tantarra.

08:24.540 --> 08:27.380
What? Um, I got the
"free" part right?

08:29.340 --> 08:31.440
The Trandoshans took
the kid months ago.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.280
As long as they hold the pup, the
Wookiees don't dare fight back.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.220
So... we're gonna have to break into
the heavily guarded island prison

08:41.250 --> 08:43.320
and rescue her?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.260
Okay.
<i>That</i> you understood?

08:45.290 --> 08:47.190
We're sorry. This is
a big misunderstanding.

08:47.230 --> 08:50.100
How 'bout we give you the
wood back, and deal's off?

08:51.530 --> 08:55.530
In Wookiee culture, you break
a deal, they break you.

08:55.570 --> 08:58.140
So you better save his kid.

08:58.170 --> 09:02.330
An actual mission
to rescue an actual princess

09:02.380 --> 09:04.480
like an actual Jedi?

09:04.510 --> 09:07.380
Yes! Princess rescue!

09:12.290 --> 09:15.360
Kordi, why didn't you leave the wood
with Roger on the <i>StarScavenger?</i>

09:15.390 --> 09:18.360
Because that's too much
pressure on poor Roger.

09:18.390 --> 09:22.250
He's had a hard day, what with all
the "head getting ripped off" stuff.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.330
Plus, you're not letting anybody
touch that wood till we get paid.

09:25.370 --> 09:28.070
Nope. I am not.

09:32.170 --> 09:35.070
Any ideas how
to get over those walls?

09:35.110 --> 09:37.080
With that catapult.

09:37.110 --> 09:40.080
What catapult?
I don't see a catapult.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.470
You aren't seeing the right way.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.460
Um, Zander, maybe we should
test this thing...

09:55.430 --> 09:58.330
Oh. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.290
I was talking to the wood.

10:02.270 --> 10:04.270
What are you doing?

10:04.300 --> 10:07.330
Delivering a replacement panel for
the main cell block controls.

10:07.370 --> 10:11.170
Kind of garish, I know, but we
just do what the boss tells us.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.580
Come on.

10:12.610 --> 10:15.110
You expect me to believe that?

10:15.180 --> 10:16.540
Okay, you got us.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.540
Actually, it's a prison break.

10:18.580 --> 10:21.550
People break into detention centers
all the time to free a captive

10:21.590 --> 10:24.130
with nothing but a hunk
of fine, handcrafted wood.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.530
'Cause that makes sense!

10:25.560 --> 10:27.530
Hmm.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.570
Ah. Main cell block is up
the stairs to the right.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.600
Thank you.

10:33.630 --> 10:37.360
You just intimidated
a Trandoshan prison guard.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.500
I'm in awe.

10:42.510 --> 10:44.410
I... feel something.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.400
Something like hurrying up?

10:46.450 --> 10:50.190
Come on. Princess rescue!
Remember?

10:52.290 --> 10:54.320
Cell number 1138.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.310
Here!

10:58.660 --> 11:01.130
- Greetings, Princess Tantarra.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.170
No!
Princess, we're here...

11:06.200 --> 11:08.140
to help you.

11:08.170 --> 11:11.540
- Princess!
- Oh, I see what happened.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.470
"Prince."

11:14.510 --> 11:16.580
"Princess."

11:18.480 --> 11:21.380
What? Not my fault
they sound so much alike.

11:21.410 --> 11:25.240
This is Prince Tantarra.

11:26.350 --> 11:28.250
Oh, great.

11:28.290 --> 11:30.390
Any other words
you wanna mistranslate?

11:34.230 --> 11:36.200
Trandoshans.

11:36.230 --> 11:41.140
I know all about them.
They respect and fear us.

11:41.170 --> 11:42.540
You two! Over here!

11:42.570 --> 11:44.610
I need to speak to you.
Yes?

11:44.640 --> 11:46.610
How are you?

11:46.640 --> 11:48.610
Uh, Plumestriker here
has some questions.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.600
Have you seen anything unusual?

11:50.640 --> 11:53.510
Not that my blockade
got run or anything.

11:53.550 --> 11:55.480
You know, all is fine.
It's fine.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.520
No.
Leave us.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.490
Excuse me! How dare you
speak to me that way!

12:00.520 --> 12:03.290
I am your commander.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.280
But if now is not a good
time, I can come back.

12:06.330 --> 12:10.270
Are you sure you haven't noticed
anything out of the ordinary?

12:10.300 --> 12:12.330
Rebels?
Bounty hunters?

12:12.370 --> 12:15.170
Uh, perhaps some droids?

12:15.200 --> 12:20.230
Nothing. Just that delivery of wood panel
you requested for the main cell block.

12:20.270 --> 12:23.200
But I didn't request any panel.
Was it nice?

12:23.240 --> 12:27.510
Sir! I bet that ship's crew is
using the cover of wood delivery

12:27.550 --> 12:29.550
to infiltrate
the main cell block.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.510
This nothing is suddenly
becoming a something.

12:32.550 --> 12:35.380
Sound the alarm!

12:35.420 --> 12:36.580
I said, sound the alarm!

12:38.520 --> 12:41.320
Or I can do it myself.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.290
I hate to be a bother.
Where is the alarm button?

12:51.300 --> 12:53.330
Stairs.

12:53.370 --> 12:57.340
Oh, so many... stairs.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.550
I got a second wind!

13:02.150 --> 13:04.190
There's Roger, right on time!

13:05.520 --> 13:08.560
Fire the flare!

13:08.590 --> 13:13.500
It signals your father that you're safe,
so he can begin the attack on the prison.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.530
I don't like that look.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.330
A Kyber Saber crystal.

13:21.370 --> 13:23.340
That's what I've been feeling!

13:23.370 --> 13:25.410
There's one here,
and I have to find it.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.240
No way. We promised to
get Tantarra out of here.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.356
And the Wookiees are about to
bomb this place into oblivion!

13:30.380 --> 13:33.280
Not to mention the entire
prison is looking for us.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.370
Don't move!

13:35.410 --> 13:37.180
See?

13:39.220 --> 13:42.990
Guys, there's
a Kyber Saber crysit.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.020
Bigger problems, Rowan.
I got this.

13:45.060 --> 13:48.360
Delivery! Can you tell us
where the main cell block...

13:52.100 --> 13:54.000
The Wookiee raid has started.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.330
Rowan, this place is about to
be blown into a pile of bricks.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.400
- Where are you going?
- To find the crystal!

14:01.440 --> 14:04.310
You know, for the good
of the galaxy?

14:04.340 --> 14:07.170
No, Tantarra!
Not you too!

14:07.210 --> 14:10.380
Ugh, this has gone from perfect
to poodoo really fast.

14:10.420 --> 14:12.320
We gotta go after them.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.200
Roger!
Rendezvous in the woods.

14:22.230 --> 14:24.200
It's too dangerous
for you up here.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.200
Yes, it is!

14:36.110 --> 14:38.380
There!

14:48.290 --> 14:50.260
I need to focus.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.290
Remember my training.
Breathe.

14:54.290 --> 14:57.190
Hands up, scaleless scum.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.200
Did you see that?
I took out the big one.

15:02.230 --> 15:04.160
No, you didn't.
That was me.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.200
The crystal! Come on! I'm just
saying, I've got a serious arm.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.210
Oh, keep deluding yourself.

15:11.240 --> 15:16.070
There's just something
about looking out a window.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.120
So, we're not
joining the fray, sir?

15:18.150 --> 15:24.030
No! We stay out and up...
Out of the battle and up here.

15:24.060 --> 15:26.090
Sir! Look!
The intruders!

15:28.430 --> 15:31.070
No! I lost them
in the smoke.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.300
Ah, gee.
Well, keep looking.

15:33.330 --> 15:36.360
I will, sir.
I will.

15:38.340 --> 15:39.440
It's close.
I know it.

15:46.310 --> 15:49.270
Hurry, before something
happens to the wood!

15:49.320 --> 15:51.150
Or us!

15:51.180 --> 15:53.240
It's somewhere in there.

15:59.190 --> 16:00.220
Found it.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.190
Whoa.
Um, anybody got a ladder?

16:04.230 --> 16:08.100
There they are!
Blast 'em!

16:13.170 --> 16:16.030
Cover me... while I
get the crystal!

16:16.080 --> 16:18.350
Cover you? With what?

16:21.050 --> 16:24.350
- I could use some help here!
- I got my own problems!

16:48.210 --> 16:52.050
Won't... come... loose.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.190
Yaah! Ugh.

17:01.190 --> 17:04.960
Yes! Thanks, Tantarra!

17:04.990 --> 17:07.060
No. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

17:16.040 --> 17:18.410
Rowan!
Rowan!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.380
That's Wookiee
for "I got it!"

17:29.420 --> 17:32.250
Great! Fabulous!
Let's get out of here.

17:48.070 --> 17:50.140
- He says, "Thank you."
- You sure this time...

17:50.170 --> 17:53.110
Pretty sure.

17:55.070 --> 17:57.000
We have given the Wookiees hope.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.440
Our pleasure.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.940
And while we're
handing out thanks,

18:03.980 --> 18:06.310
thank you for looking after
our little brother.

18:08.390 --> 18:11.290
He says we've honored our agreement
and this isn't our battle.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.220
Or maybe he said something
about, "This isn't our cattle."

18:14.260 --> 18:16.260
Either way, we should go.

18:28.110 --> 18:30.180
Whoa!

18:31.280 --> 18:34.050
Oh, thank the maker you're safe.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.050
Hold it right there!

18:38.020 --> 18:41.090
I hate this place so, so much.

18:41.120 --> 18:45.960
It's like you always say, sir...
"Find the ship, find the crew."

18:45.990 --> 18:49.420
I said that? Really?
I like that. It's good.

18:49.460 --> 18:52.420
You two have caused me
a lot of trouble.

18:52.460 --> 18:56.330
Wait. Two? W... Weren't there more?
So what should I do?

18:56.370 --> 18:58.440
Well, I could arrest you.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.940
Or maybe I should blast you.

19:00.970 --> 19:04.340
Or maybe I should arrest you
and then blast you.

19:04.380 --> 19:09.180
Hmm. You know what
I <i>wood</i> do, Zander?

19:09.220 --> 19:11.220
Could've sworn there were three.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.320
What, Rowan?
What <i>wood</i> you do?

19:13.350 --> 19:16.110
<i>Wood</i> you tell me?
Uh...

19:16.160 --> 19:19.160
<i>-Wood</i> you please?

19:22.260 --> 19:25.190
That.
You did it, Kordi.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.190
Yes, I did.

19:29.070 --> 19:31.140
Maybe we can go back
and get another piece of...

19:33.040 --> 19:37.110
- Never mind.
- Warmer. Warmer. Good!

19:37.140 --> 19:39.940
Aaah!

19:39.980 --> 19:43.050
Seriously?
Uh! Uh!

19:47.050 --> 19:48.410
Well?

19:48.450 --> 19:50.050
As promised...

19:53.460 --> 19:57.000
One genuine Wroshyr wood panel.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.330
No returns. Now give me
that case o' credits!

20:01.030 --> 20:05.300
This is a bitter disappointment,
and I shan't pay for it.

20:08.410 --> 20:10.340
Oh!

20:10.380 --> 20:12.280
All that for nothing?

20:12.310 --> 20:15.240
It wasn't for nothing. We gave
the Wookiees hope, remember?

20:15.280 --> 20:19.140
Hope doesn't put blue milk
on the table, or...

20:19.180 --> 20:20.340
<i>Pay the rent!</i>

20:20.390 --> 20:22.290
Yeah, that.

20:22.320 --> 20:27.180
We had an amazing adventure and
I found a Kyber Saber crystal!

20:27.230 --> 20:30.260
- Did you?
- Yep! Here you go, Naare.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.100
Straight from Kashyyyk.
Kashyyyk?

20:33.130 --> 20:36.190
The Trandoshans must have brought
it from their home world.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.110
Excellent, Rowan.

20:38.140 --> 20:41.180
Your powers are growing
at a most impressive rate.

20:41.210 --> 20:44.180
See?
Everyone's happy.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.180
Uh, almost everyone.

20:48.110 --> 20:51.180
It doesn't matter.
I've learned my lesson.

20:51.220 --> 20:54.060
Next time, spring for
the translation droid?

20:54.090 --> 20:57.020
Yes!

20:59.060 --> 21:02.430
So while there are
many fingers to point,

21:02.460 --> 21:07.990
I'd like to reiterate that
none should be pointed at me.

21:08.030 --> 21:11.060
<i>You have failed us
for the last time,</i>

21:11.100 --> 21:13.030
<i>Lieutenant Commander Durpin.</i>

21:15.040 --> 21:19.380
<i>Because you had to rely on those incompetent
Trandoshans to get the job done.</i>

21:19.410 --> 21:21.970
<i>No wonder you failed.</i>

21:22.010 --> 21:25.380
<i>You need more men.
And more ships.</i>

21:25.420 --> 21:27.460
<i>That's how you prevent failure.</i>

21:27.490 --> 21:30.390
<i>And with all that
responsibility comes...</i>

21:30.420 --> 21:32.380
<i>a promotion.</i>

21:32.420 --> 21:37.020
- Oh, no. <i>-Congratulations,
General Durpin.</i>

21:37.060 --> 21:40.290
<i>I'll be keeping my eye on you.</i>

21:43.040 --> 21:46.410
This is great!
Isn't it great?

21:46.440 --> 21:51.380
You're finally getting the
attention you so richly deserve.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.410
Sir?

21:53.450 --> 21:56.350
Can you hear me over
all that head banging?
