cooling down into the evening,</i>

01:53.828 --> 01:58.371

02:05.510 --> 02:07.985
I'm coming. I'm coming.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.991
J&H Scrap.
You bring us trash,
we pay you cash.

02:15.322 --> 02:16.686
Oh, sure thing.
I'll get him.

02:17.161 --> 02:20.063
Hank! Phone!

02:21.594 --> 02:23.627
Okey-doke.

02:23.627 --> 02:26.003
Bruce, when are you gonna
start answering the phone?

02:26.003 --> 02:28.665
Living here
rent-free.

02:29.602 --> 02:31.371
Yell-o. Hello?

02:32.176 --> 02:33.670
Weird.
There's nobody there.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.870
What do you mean?
I was just talking
to her.

02:35.870 --> 02:39.313
Hello? Hello?
What on earth?

02:41.843 --> 02:43.713
The door's locked.

02:43.713 --> 02:45.682
There's
somebody
outside.

02:45.682 --> 02:48.553
What? Where?
Look. Over there.

02:48.553 --> 02:50.885
What are they doing?

02:50.885 --> 02:53.899
Looks like
they're stealing
the crane!

02:56.728 --> 02:59.729
Oh, my goodness.
They're heading straight
for the welding tanks!

03:22.554 --> 03:25.755
Hello? PAW Patrol?
This is Janet from J&H Scrap.

03:25.755 --> 03:27.856
The whole place
is burning down!

03:27.856 --> 03:29.099
You've got to come quick!

03:46.712 --> 03:49.317
All right, pups,
we've got a fire
at the scrapyard.

03:49.317 --> 03:51.946
And by the sounds of it,
we don't have much time.

03:51.946 --> 03:54.916
No fire's too big,
no pup's too small!

04:00.990 --> 04:04.299
Skye, you are clear
for takeoff.

04:04.299 --> 04:06.103
Let's take to the sky!

04:08.930 --> 04:11.108
And away we go!

04:16.445 --> 04:18.676
Pups, get ready to launch.

04:52.877 --> 04:55.218
PAW Patrol is on a roll!

05:16.967 --> 05:18.736
I've got eyes
on the fire.

05:18.736 --> 05:21.805
It's a big one.
I'm going in for a water drop.

05:36.052 --> 05:39.328
The entrance is blocked.
I'm gonna clear a way in.

05:45.369 --> 05:48.535
Whoo! Bullseye!

05:48.535 --> 05:52.275
Hot dog! It's the PAW Patrol!
They're gonna save us!

05:52.275 --> 05:54.937
The PAW Patrol! Oh, Bruce,
you're gonna love them.

05:54.937 --> 05:58.215
They're cute little puppies
who drive around in cars.

05:58.215 --> 06:00.382
I know that sounds weird,
but just go with it.

06:04.553 --> 06:07.191
All right, Marshall,
let's fight that fire.

06:07.191 --> 06:09.127
Arf! Water cannon!

06:33.186 --> 06:34.581
Help!
Over here!

06:34.581 --> 06:36.044
Help!
Help!

06:36.044 --> 06:37.617
Help us!

06:37.617 --> 06:39.718
Marshall, the trailer's
on fire!

06:39.718 --> 06:41.423
I'm all out of water!

06:41.423 --> 06:43.458
Oh, no.
Incoming!

06:49.433 --> 06:51.092
Yeah, Skye!

07:04.974 --> 07:07.977
You see that right there?
That's why she's
my favorite pup.

07:07.977 --> 07:09.451
PAW Patrol!

07:09.451 --> 07:11.288
Let's get you out of there.

07:12.687 --> 07:15.149
Whoa!

07:15.149 --> 07:16.491
Oh!

07:16.491 --> 07:17.987
Oops. Sorry.

07:17.987 --> 07:20.297
And that's why
I wear a hard hat.

07:21.366 --> 07:24.125
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

07:24.125 --> 07:27.733
We're just glad you're okay.
Hopefully there's not
too much damage.

07:27.733 --> 07:31.165
Well, the good thing
is it was all junk
to begin with.

07:31.165 --> 07:34.311
These are the brave pups
I was telling you about.

07:34.311 --> 07:36.841
This is Bruce.
He's a sensitive soul.

07:36.841 --> 07:38.711
This is all
a bit much for him.

07:39.976 --> 07:42.517
Hey, let's get a picture
with Bruce and the pups.

07:42.517 --> 07:43.980
Oh, great idea.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.686
Janet, grab the little one
so she gets in the photo.

07:46.686 --> 07:49.117
I'm fine down here.
Come here, sweetie.

07:49.117 --> 07:51.185
Everybody say, "Junk."

07:51.185 --> 07:52.692
Junk!

07:54.465 --> 07:57.301
Ugh! I hate being
the smallest pup.

07:57.301 --> 08:00.733
If she picked me up like that,
I'd have hit her
with the dog breath.

08:03.868 --> 08:07.509
That trailer was locked
from the outside.
How did that happen?

08:07.509 --> 08:10.710
Well, you're not
gonna believe this,
but somebody locked us up

08:10.710 --> 08:14.142
so they could steal
our 10-ton electromagnet.

08:14.142 --> 08:17.915
Who would want to steal
a 10-ton electromagnet?

08:39.774 --> 08:41.675
It's showtime.

08:46.779 --> 08:48.583
Hey, what's going on, everybody?

08:48.583 --> 08:52.114
I'm Sam Stringer here,
reporting live from
downtown Adventure City,

08:52.114 --> 08:54.248
where we're about to see
the largest meteor shower

08:54.248 --> 08:56.624
we've had in over 50 years.

08:56.624 --> 08:59.528
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor!

08:59.528 --> 09:02.762
Ah, I'm just so excited
to see the meteor, Chickaletta.

09:04.192 --> 09:06.403
As you can see,
it's meteor fever out here,

09:06.403 --> 09:09.439
and everyone is turning
their eyes to the sky.

09:09.439 --> 09:12.607
Meteor! Meteor! Meteor...

09:21.277 --> 09:22.320
See any meteors?

09:24.047 --> 09:26.390
All I can see
is your giant head.

09:26.390 --> 09:28.920
Oops. Sorry.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.956
Come on, Rubble.
You're gonna miss the meteor.

09:31.956 --> 09:33.463
Do you really
expect me to watch

09:33.463 --> 09:36.796
a once-in-a-lifetime
celestial event
without snacks?

09:42.441 --> 09:45.035
Hey, Chase,
you have a rip
in your suit.

09:45.035 --> 09:46.575
I do?

09:46.575 --> 09:49.413
Yeah. Looks like
you're too big for
this thing already.

09:49.413 --> 09:51.415
You're all growing so fast.

09:51.415 --> 09:53.978
All of us? Even me?

09:53.978 --> 09:57.454
Not yet, Skye. You're still
pretty much the same size.

09:57.454 --> 10:00.688
But it's nothing
to worry about. All pups
grow at their own speed.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.153
And some of us
never grow at all.

10:05.858 --> 10:07.189
Oh, great.
They're here.

10:08.698 --> 10:11.831
Come on up. Pups,
we've got company.

10:13.538 --> 10:15.835
I'd like you to meet
the Junior Patrollers.

10:15.835 --> 10:17.166
Nano.
Hello!

10:17.166 --> 10:18.299
Mini.
Hi!

10:18.299 --> 10:20.136
And Tot.
What's up?

10:20.136 --> 10:22.479
When they grow up,
they want to be
in the PAW Patrol.

10:22.479 --> 10:25.207
So I invited them to watch
the meteor shower with us.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.945
You're Chase.

10:26.945 --> 10:28.177
Uh, yep.

10:28.177 --> 10:30.113
You're on the case.

10:30.113 --> 10:31.455
I guess I am.

10:32.623 --> 10:34.524
And you're Rubble!

10:34.524 --> 10:37.252
Cool glasses.
Thank you.

10:37.252 --> 10:40.354
Wow, Skye, I'm almost
as tall as you!

10:40.354 --> 10:45.469
Well, I'm definitely taller.
But not for long.

10:45.469 --> 10:47.361
Why don't you guys
check out the telescope?

10:47.361 --> 10:49.330
Whoa!
My turn, my turn!

10:49.330 --> 10:51.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa!

10:52.742 --> 10:54.236
Take it easy, puffballs.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.842
This thing is expensive.

10:55.842 --> 10:56.942
Oops.
Whoops.

10:56.942 --> 10:58.416
Sorry.

10:58.416 --> 11:00.484
Let's try that again.

11:00.484 --> 11:03.850
Take a look through
the eyepiece and tell us
what you see.

11:03.850 --> 11:06.886
Carefully look through
the eyepiece. Carefully.

11:09.660 --> 11:12.991
I don't know about this whole
"Junior Patrollers" thing.

11:12.991 --> 11:14.498
I mean, when did
the PAW Patrol become

11:14.498 --> 11:16.027
a babysitting service?

11:16.027 --> 11:17.699
Come on, Liberty.

11:17.699 --> 11:19.998
Don't write them off
just because they're small.

11:19.998 --> 11:21.065
Whoa!

11:21.065 --> 11:22.671
Look at all the stars.

11:22.671 --> 11:24.706
There must be
a billion of them.

11:24.706 --> 11:26.169
We should count them all.

11:26.169 --> 11:27.269
Okay.

11:27.269 --> 11:33.616
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

11:42.185 --> 11:46.794
Hello, world. Hello, universe.
Hello, Internet!

11:46.794 --> 11:48.664
My name is Victoria Vance,

11:48.664 --> 11:50.897
and I'm making
this video as proof

11:50.897 --> 11:53.669
that I'm the greatest
scientist in history.

11:53.669 --> 11:56.067
Oh, and don't
believe the rumors.

11:56.067 --> 11:58.333
I'm not a mad scientist.

11:58.333 --> 12:01.545
I mean, sure, sometimes
I act a little mad,

12:01.545 --> 12:03.778
and I am a scientist,

12:03.778 --> 12:07.276
but that doesn't make me
a mad scientist.

12:07.276 --> 12:09.113
You got that? Good.

12:11.214 --> 12:16.087
Now, I've been
tracking meteor X-2805
for the past two years.

12:16.087 --> 12:18.958
It contains some kind of
power source

12:18.958 --> 12:21.928
stronger than anything
we've ever seen on Earth.

12:21.928 --> 12:26.097
Which brings me to my latest
invention, the Meteor Magnet!

12:27.738 --> 12:29.837
Cool name, right?

12:29.837 --> 12:31.938
This sweet little tractor beam

12:31.938 --> 12:34.204
will pull that meteor
out of the sky

12:34.204 --> 12:37.273
and gently deliver
it to my doorstep.

12:40.146 --> 12:43.477
Now, let's get ready to party.

13:01.431 --> 13:03.233
Whoo-hoo!

13:03.233 --> 13:05.609
I've locked on to the meteor
and I'm reeling it in!

13:09.340 --> 13:11.846
I did it. I did it!

13:11.846 --> 13:14.651
Me. Victoria Vance.

13:14.651 --> 13:17.621
To all the haters out there
who laughed at me

13:17.621 --> 13:22.252
and called me a mad scientist,
who's laughing now?

13:26.126 --> 13:27.356
Uh-oh.

13:30.064 --> 13:32.570
No! No, no, no!

13:32.570 --> 13:34.836
The meteor is stronger
than I expected.

13:44.043 --> 13:46.507
I don't have enough power!

13:56.552 --> 13:59.564
That is not good.

14:07.431 --> 14:10.839
...3,034, 3,035,

14:10.839 --> 14:15.536
3,036, 3,037, 3,038...

14:15.536 --> 14:17.681
There it is!

14:17.681 --> 14:19.683
Whoa.

14:20.950 --> 14:23.544
I didn't think
it would be so bright.

14:23.544 --> 14:25.623
It looks like it's headed
straight for us.

14:28.318 --> 14:31.024
That's because it is!

14:31.024 --> 14:32.960
Everybody out
of the pup tower!

14:43.368 --> 14:46.039
Get those
people inside! Go, go, go!

14:46.039 --> 14:49.944
Everybody out of the street!
You need to take cover
right now!

14:49.944 --> 14:53.013
Take shelter!
The meteor's heading
straight for us!

14:59.085 --> 15:01.626
Everybody inside! Get inside!

15:07.027 --> 15:08.589
Oh!
Come on, buddy.
Get up. Let's go.

15:10.593 --> 15:13.297
Get out of the street!
We don't have much time!

15:15.631 --> 15:16.641
Clear!

15:18.304 --> 15:19.303
Street's clear!

15:20.141 --> 15:21.206
Clear!

15:21.206 --> 15:23.142
Good job, pups.
Now take cover!

15:41.525 --> 15:42.590
Get down!

15:56.672 --> 15:58.045
Is everybody okay?

15:58.883 --> 15:59.882
I'm okay.

16:01.314 --> 16:03.347
I'm good.

16:03.347 --> 16:06.647
I'm fine, but I'm gonna need
a serious bath.

16:12.259 --> 16:14.061
Oh, my goodness.

16:14.061 --> 16:16.162
Wait. Where are
the Junior Patrollers?

16:16.868 --> 16:19.363
Nano? Mini? Tot?

16:20.399 --> 16:21.464
Whoa!

16:21.464 --> 16:24.775
That was epic.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.503
I'm so glad nobody got hurt.

16:28.374 --> 16:30.374
Oh, no. Look.

16:33.577 --> 16:37.953
The pup tower.
It's completely destroyed.

16:42.058 --> 16:44.355
Our home.
Our vehicles.

16:45.193 --> 16:47.160
It's all gone.

16:58.844 --> 17:00.877
That little thing
did all this?

17:07.279 --> 17:11.921
This meteor is
giving off some kind of
strange energy pulse.

17:11.921 --> 17:14.550
Let's get it out of here until
we find out what's going on.

17:20.063 --> 17:22.558
At approximately 7:31 p.m.,

17:22.558 --> 17:25.264
a meteor, which was meant
to safely pass by the planet,

17:25.264 --> 17:28.905
suddenly veered off course,
crashing into Adventure City,

17:28.905 --> 17:31.270
causing massive destruction!

17:31.270 --> 17:35.109
I was there, people!
I almost got squashed!

17:35.109 --> 17:37.639
Whew! Okay.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.345
The mad scientist
Victoria Vance was arrested

17:40.345 --> 17:42.743
after taking credit
for the disaster online.

17:42.743 --> 17:47.385
<i>I did it! Me.
Victoria Vance.</i>

17:47.385 --> 17:50.157
Yikes. Ooh!
That's an open and shut case.

17:57.725 --> 17:59.562
You can't lock me up!

17:59.562 --> 18:03.335
I'm the greatest scientist
in the world!

18:03.335 --> 18:05.634
More like the maddest
scientist in the world.

18:05.634 --> 18:07.108
I heard that.

18:07.108 --> 18:10.606
I am not a mad scientist!

18:17.989 --> 18:19.714
Hello, roomie.

18:43.738 --> 18:46.477
It looks like
it stopped glowing.

18:46.477 --> 18:49.887
Maybe that's a good thing.
The glowing freaks me out.

19:01.131 --> 19:04.132
This will analyze the meteor
and tell us what it's made of.

19:04.132 --> 19:07.003
We'll leave it scanning
overnight and see what
we can learn.

19:12.670 --> 19:14.978
All right, pups, time for bed.

19:20.414 --> 19:21.479
Argh, come on.

19:21.479 --> 19:23.184
Need a little help
there, Skye?

19:23.184 --> 19:25.054
Nope. No, I got it.

19:51.709 --> 19:54.875
Good night, pups.
If you need me,
I'm just down the hall.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.745
Ryder?
Yeah?

19:56.745 --> 20:00.485
I miss the pup tower.
I don't like sleeping
in new places.

20:00.485 --> 20:02.993
I'm never gonna be able
to get to sleep.

20:02.993 --> 20:07.426
Well, we've all had
a long day. You're probably
more tired than you think.

20:14.862 --> 20:16.237
See you in the morning.

20:41.792 --> 20:44.166
Rubble, quit messing
with the light.

20:47.897 --> 20:49.633
Rubble!

20:53.144 --> 20:54.539
What is that?

22:08.747 --> 22:09.845
Weird.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.356
I didn't do it!

22:40.944 --> 22:42.218
No way.

22:54.364 --> 22:55.462
Whoa.

22:57.664 --> 22:58.762
Whoa!

23:03.569 --> 23:04.702
Whoa.

23:05.639 --> 23:06.638
Whoa.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.755
Looks like the smallest pup
just became the strongest pup.

23:34.437 --> 23:37.273
All right, let's see
what this thing
can really do.

23:40.773 --> 23:41.805
Whoa!

23:42.938 --> 23:45.149
What's going on?
Is everybody okay?

23:46.680 --> 23:49.879
I think I've got superpowers.

23:51.982 --> 23:53.080
Whoa.

23:53.984 --> 23:55.687
Whoa.

23:55.687 --> 23:57.491
No way.

24:01.299 --> 24:04.696
This is the weirdest dream
I've ever had.

24:04.696 --> 24:08.205
Uh, Rubble,
you're not dreaming.

24:08.205 --> 24:11.802
Oh. Then this is the weirdest
awake I've ever had.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.455
Look at your paws.

24:31.791 --> 24:33.329
Whoa.

24:33.329 --> 24:35.694
It's some kind of fireball.

24:35.694 --> 24:38.532
Well, that makes sense.
You're a fire pup.

24:38.532 --> 24:40.501
I wonder what
your power is.

24:42.538 --> 24:44.637
Huh? Chase?
Marshall!

24:44.637 --> 24:48.542
Up here!
Hey, how'd you get
over there so fast?

24:49.908 --> 24:51.380
Get over where?

24:54.715 --> 24:56.517
Great. Now the clumsy pup

24:56.517 --> 24:58.486
shoots fireballs
out of his paws.

24:58.486 --> 25:00.147
Don't worry. I got it.

25:04.329 --> 25:07.627
Dudes,
I'm one with the water.

25:11.567 --> 25:12.764
Awesome.

25:19.234 --> 25:21.740
Check me out.
I'm a walking magnet.

25:22.446 --> 25:24.105
Huh?

25:28.582 --> 25:29.682
Sorry about that.

25:31.279 --> 25:34.049
Cool. I'm a wrecking ball.

25:39.793 --> 25:42.123
Whoa, Rubble, are you okay?

25:43.027 --> 25:44.730
Rock 'n' roll!

25:51.035 --> 25:52.672
What's your power, Liberty?

25:52.672 --> 25:55.378
That's a good question.
I'm trying to figure it out.

25:55.378 --> 25:57.809
Okay, come on. Here we go.
Superpowers on three.

25:58.416 --> 26:00.911
One, two, three.

26:01.848 --> 26:03.111
Whoa!

26:03.111 --> 26:04.915
Okay, okay.

26:04.915 --> 26:07.885
It's not
the power of flight.

26:07.885 --> 26:11.526
That's because
it's magnet paws!

26:13.090 --> 26:14.089
Nope.

26:18.667 --> 26:21.833
That's it.
I'm a superpowered
wrecking ball!

26:23.298 --> 26:24.572
Yeah!

26:24.572 --> 26:25.606
Whoo!

26:29.236 --> 26:32.074
What's going on here?
I've got no powers.

26:32.074 --> 26:33.108
What a rip-off.

26:34.177 --> 26:37.486
Skye can fly.
Marshall can control fire.

26:37.486 --> 26:39.488
Zuma turns to water.

26:39.488 --> 26:42.084
It's like these crystals
amplify something about you.

26:42.724 --> 26:45.153
But I'm just Liberty.

26:45.153 --> 26:46.319
What's my thing?

27:00.236 --> 27:04.139
Now that we're super,
we're gonna need a new name
for ourselves.

27:04.139 --> 27:08.011
Why do we need a new name?
We're the PAW Patrol.

27:08.011 --> 27:10.178
I know, but now we're more.

27:10.178 --> 27:13.082
It's like we've got something
just a little bit extra.

27:13.557 --> 27:14.952
Ooh! I know.

27:14.952 --> 27:16.459
How about we call ourselves

27:16.459 --> 27:21.761
"the PAW Patrol But More
With Just A Little Bit Extra"?

27:23.292 --> 27:25.765
It doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.

27:27.635 --> 27:31.408
How about "the Mighty Pups"?

28:01.132 --> 28:03.572
Ready for action,
Ryder, sir!

28:17.720 --> 28:19.247
Whoa!

28:32.504 --> 28:35.769
<i>Chase, Marshall,
ready for launch.</i>

28:35.769 --> 28:37.265
Power paws!

28:37.265 --> 28:42.006
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

28:42.006 --> 28:47.583
<i>seven, six, five, four...</i>

28:47.583 --> 28:51.081
<i>...three, two, one,</i>

28:52.821 --> 28:53.820
<i>go!</i>

29:02.831 --> 29:04.424
Power paws!

29:06.802 --> 29:09.066
<i>Skye, Rocky,</i>

29:10.608 --> 29:11.640
<i>go!</i>

29:16.306 --> 29:19.582
<i>Zuma, Rubble,
ready for launch.</i>

29:19.582 --> 29:23.553
Did he say "lunch"?
<i>No, I said launch!</i>

29:23.553 --> 29:25.181
<i>Go!</i>

29:29.627 --> 29:31.154
Uh, Ryder?

29:31.154 --> 29:34.663
As you know, I didn't get
any superpowers.

29:34.663 --> 29:36.632
So, I'm not totally sure
what to do here.

29:36.632 --> 29:38.766
I've been thinking
about that, Liberty,

29:38.766 --> 29:41.131
and I've got a very important
mission for you.

29:41.131 --> 29:44.233
You do? Yes! That's what
I'm talking about!

29:44.233 --> 29:46.972
Whatever you need,
anything at all, I'm your pup.

29:46.972 --> 29:50.646
Great. I need you
to hang back and look after
the Junior Patrollers.

29:52.650 --> 29:54.914
Oh, that's not a good idea.
Nope. Mm-mm.

29:54.914 --> 29:56.278
I'm trying to be
more flexible,

29:56.278 --> 29:58.984
but I don't know the first
thing about little kids.

29:58.984 --> 30:01.448
Don't worry, Liberty.
You'll be great at it.

30:01.448 --> 30:03.285
Mighty Pups are on a roll!

30:05.322 --> 30:10.028
Ryder, come back!
I'm not built for babysitting!

30:18.335 --> 30:19.334
Oh!

31:03.611 --> 31:05.380
<i>When we hear
the word "superpowers,"</i>

31:05.380 --> 31:07.217
we usually think of big-budget
Hollywood movies

31:07.217 --> 31:09.384
starring overpaid celebrities
wearing tights.

31:09.384 --> 31:11.584
But now we know
superpowers are real.

31:11.584 --> 31:15.588
And the fluffy little doggies
who got them call themselves
"the Mighty Pups."

31:15.588 --> 31:17.161
Help!

31:32.948 --> 31:36.983
They got new powers,
new uniforms
and new merchandise.

31:36.983 --> 31:39.854
To all the parents
out there, I'm sorry.

31:43.761 --> 31:45.222
That was my meteor.

31:45.222 --> 31:47.356
Those should be
my superpowers.

31:47.356 --> 31:49.930
I can't stand
those little mongrels.

31:49.930 --> 31:52.460
I can't stand
the PAW Patrol either.

31:52.460 --> 31:55.936
That's what makes us
such perfect roommates.

31:55.936 --> 31:57.707
Yeah, well, don't get
too attached.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.599
As soon as I can find
my way out of here,

31:59.599 --> 32:01.645
I'm gonna get
my meteor back.

32:02.637 --> 32:03.812
Can you give us a minute?

32:03.812 --> 32:05.814
I need to discuss
something in private

32:05.814 --> 32:07.640
with my colleagues.

32:14.286 --> 32:16.616
Okay, here's the deal.

32:16.616 --> 32:19.762
The kitties and I
have been planning
a jailbreak.

32:19.762 --> 32:21.423
We'll help you
fly the coop

32:21.423 --> 32:25.460
if you promise to share
some of those superpowers
with me.

32:25.460 --> 32:27.330
Do we have a deal?

32:27.330 --> 32:32.137
I don't really have a lot
of options right now,
so sure, it's a deal.

32:32.137 --> 32:34.810
It's only a deal
if we shake on it.

32:36.143 --> 32:37.175
Ugh.

32:37.175 --> 32:39.210
We all shake on it.

32:42.314 --> 32:44.314
Ugh! Are you kidding me?

32:47.119 --> 32:51.057
Excellent, excellent.
Sealing the deal.
Wonderful.

32:51.057 --> 32:53.620
Now, if you'll direct
your attention over there,

32:53.620 --> 32:56.832
I left you
a little surprise
in the toilet.

32:58.660 --> 33:01.133
Yeah. No, thanks.
I'm good.

33:01.133 --> 33:03.740
Don't be shy.
Lift the lid.

33:11.341 --> 33:14.707
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

33:14.707 --> 33:17.380
It took me a lot
of hard work.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.654
<i>The Mighty Pups have
incredible superpowers.</i>

33:27.654 --> 33:32.296
<i>Skye can fly, Chase has
super speed and Rubble
is a real-life wrecking ball.</i>

33:32.296 --> 33:34.199
Okay, no more messing around.

33:34.199 --> 33:38.566
My superpower is fire paws!

33:40.075 --> 33:42.845
Nope. Okay. Okay. That's okay.

33:42.845 --> 33:45.276
It's super speed.

33:50.380 --> 33:52.382
I think I'm gonna be sick.

33:52.382 --> 33:54.747
<i>Thanks to
the superpowers contained
in the mysterious meteor,</i>

33:54.747 --> 33:57.750
<i>these pups are truly unstoppable.</i>

33:57.750 --> 34:01.325
Come on, Liberty.
Be flexible. Be flexible!

34:01.325 --> 34:04.801
<i>Adventure City simply
can't get enough
of these Mighty Pups.</i>

34:05.595 --> 34:06.759
Hey!

34:06.759 --> 34:09.729
We were watching that.
That's the problem.

34:09.729 --> 34:12.270
We're just sitting
around watching.

34:12.270 --> 34:15.944
We might not have superpowers,
but that doesn't mean
we can't contribute.

34:15.944 --> 34:17.946
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

34:17.946 --> 34:21.708
but are you three puffballs
serious about joining
the PAW Patrol one day?

34:21.708 --> 34:23.743
Yes!
Absolutely!

34:23.743 --> 34:26.713
More than anything
in the entire universe!

34:26.713 --> 34:29.551
Then you guys are going
to be my personal project.

34:29.551 --> 34:31.256
I'm gonna teach you
everything I know,

34:31.256 --> 34:35.260
and turn you into lean, mean,
fluffy little rescue machines.

34:35.260 --> 34:36.657
Wicked!

34:39.002 --> 34:42.839
...97, 98, 99, 100.

34:42.839 --> 34:44.005
Your turn.

34:44.766 --> 34:46.469
One...
One...

34:48.671 --> 34:50.913
Yeesh.

34:50.913 --> 34:54.279
You're running with the big
dogs now! No pain, no gain!

35:03.653 --> 35:05.356
Let's do this!

35:06.456 --> 35:09.195
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:11.529 --> 35:13.100
Ugh.

35:13.100 --> 35:14.827
<i>Come on! Move it, move it!</i>

35:14.827 --> 35:17.038
<i>We're gonna take you
from puff to tough!</i>

35:17.038 --> 35:19.766
<i>Is that all you got?
I thought you wanted
to be in the PAW Patrol.</i>

35:19.766 --> 35:21.405
<i>I want to see you hustle.</i>

35:22.441 --> 35:24.276
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

35:24.276 --> 35:27.378
<i>You're lean, you're mean,
you're a fluffy little
rescue machine!</i>

35:27.378 --> 35:28.841
Take it easy, Liberty.

35:28.841 --> 35:32.350
Remember, the Junior Patroller
program is just for fun.

35:32.350 --> 35:35.254
And there's nothing
more fun than realizing
your full potential.

35:35.254 --> 35:36.354
Huh?

35:36.354 --> 35:37.993
<i>I didn't say stop.</i>

35:37.993 --> 35:39.390
<i>Move it, move it, move it!</i>

35:50.863 --> 35:53.602
Not much further.
We're almost there.

35:53.602 --> 35:55.978
You said that
two miles ago.

35:55.978 --> 35:59.410
Oh, stop complaining.
Just be happy
I broke you out of jail.

36:02.481 --> 36:06.186
I'll be happy when I have
something else to look at.

36:06.186 --> 36:07.847
We're here!

36:16.968 --> 36:18.726
Ah!

36:18.726 --> 36:21.498
The sweet smell of freedom.

36:23.137 --> 36:26.404
Is that Humdinger?
What's he doing
out of jail?

36:26.404 --> 36:30.738
It is me. And I hope
I can count on your support
in the next election.

36:30.738 --> 36:33.378
Stop campaigning.
We're fugitives on the run.

36:33.378 --> 36:34.951
Sorry. I forgot.

36:34.951 --> 36:39.153
It's just so nice
to be reunited
with my adoring public.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.221
Ha! I didn't vote for you.

36:41.221 --> 36:45.027
Me neither.
You were the worst mayor
the city's ever had.

36:45.027 --> 36:48.591
Hmm! This is why I hate
free and fair elections.

36:48.591 --> 36:50.593
We just got to keep
a low profile

36:50.593 --> 36:54.102
until we get those superpowers
from the PAW Patrol.

36:54.102 --> 36:56.764
And how do you propose
we do that?

36:56.764 --> 37:01.439
We give them the one thing
they can't resist.

37:10.483 --> 37:11.680
There it is.

37:11.680 --> 37:15.387
Air Humdinger.
It's perfect.

37:15.387 --> 37:16.993
Oh, I've missed you.

37:16.993 --> 37:20.425
I had nightmares in jail
about flying coach.

37:22.394 --> 37:25.958
Are you sure you know
how to fly this thing?

37:25.958 --> 37:29.335
Oh, don't worry.
Your tacky little jet
is in good hands.

37:29.335 --> 37:32.338
I've been flying planes
like this since I was
in grade school.

37:34.078 --> 37:35.638
Must have been
a good school.

37:51.192 --> 37:52.919
<i>Autopilot activated.</i>

37:52.919 --> 37:56.725
Now we just fly around
until the PAW Patrol
comes to rescue us.

37:56.725 --> 37:59.728
And why would they do that?
Because of this.

38:03.303 --> 38:05.140
Are you out
of your mind?

38:05.868 --> 38:06.966
Whee!

38:08.640 --> 38:10.145
What are you doing?

38:10.145 --> 38:14.347
Now we're in trouble.
They'll have to come
rescue us!

38:14.347 --> 38:16.679
That was your plan?

38:16.679 --> 38:18.483
Uh-huh!

38:18.483 --> 38:22.454
Now sit down and eat
some cashews while
I go yelp for help!

38:29.430 --> 38:30.561
Stop, drop and roll!

38:32.365 --> 38:33.597
Did you see that?

38:33.597 --> 38:36.171
They're getting it.
These pups are legit.

38:36.171 --> 38:40.340
I'm happy for you, Liberty,
but maybe it's time
for a break.

38:40.340 --> 38:42.177
Do you guys want a break?

38:42.177 --> 38:44.509
We don't need
no stinking break!

38:44.509 --> 38:47.116
Ha-ha! That's what
I'm talking about, puffballs.

38:48.183 --> 38:49.679
PAW Patrol.
What's your emergency?

38:49.679 --> 38:53.155
<i>Mayday, mayday!
This is flight HD9904.</i>

38:53.155 --> 38:56.587
<i>We need immediate assistance.</i>
Hang tight. We're on our way.

39:04.531 --> 39:07.928
Skye, I need you
to fly up there and carry
that plane down safely.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.171
Are you up for it?

39:09.171 --> 39:12.735
I'm a Mighty Pup.
I was made for this.

39:12.735 --> 39:15.243
We'll provide ground support.
Come on, pups.

39:17.311 --> 39:19.280
Let's take to the sky!

39:37.399 --> 39:39.267
The PAW Patrol is here!

39:39.267 --> 39:42.369
Cut the engines and I'll carry
the plane down safely.

39:42.369 --> 39:45.097
And here you are!

39:45.097 --> 39:46.340
Humdinger?

39:46.340 --> 39:49.937
It worked exactly like
she said it would.

39:49.937 --> 39:51.906
Like who said it would?

39:51.906 --> 39:53.006
Me.

39:53.006 --> 39:54.249
My crystal!

39:54.249 --> 39:57.219
It's like taking candy
from a baby.

39:57.219 --> 39:58.715
Give that back.

39:58.715 --> 40:00.013
Ooh!

40:00.013 --> 40:01.751
You're a feisty one,
aren't you?

40:05.491 --> 40:08.890
Catch you around, pipsqueak.
Buh-bye!

40:09.992 --> 40:11.299
No!

40:11.299 --> 40:13.268
Thank you for flying
Air Humdinger.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.128
Whoo-hoo!

40:47.634 --> 40:49.667
Ryder, come in.
This is Skye.

40:49.667 --> 40:50.899
<i>How's it going
up there?</i>

40:50.899 --> 40:52.637
It was a trap.

40:52.637 --> 40:56.476
They stole my crystal,
I've got no powers and
this plane is going down.

40:56.476 --> 40:57.807
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

40:59.281 --> 41:01.943
I can't get a visual. Hang on.

41:01.943 --> 41:03.747
<i>Can you make it back
to the airport?</i>

41:06.686 --> 41:10.556
Negative. It's too far.
I need a place to land
this thing now.

41:12.989 --> 41:14.824
Copy that.
We'll have to improvise.

41:23.868 --> 41:25.604
Skye,
we're clearing a runway.

41:25.604 --> 41:27.804
I need you to set a course
for Main Street.

41:27.804 --> 41:30.103
Did you say Main Street?
<i>Affirmative.</i>

41:30.103 --> 41:32.743
That's the busiest street
in Adventure City.

41:34.318 --> 41:35.680
It's also the longest.

41:40.487 --> 41:43.853
All right, pups.
We need to make a runway
and we don't have much time.

41:43.853 --> 41:46.185
Let's move it, people.

41:46.185 --> 41:50.123
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

41:50.123 --> 41:52.730
Chase, mark the runway.
All the way down.

41:52.730 --> 41:54.160
Chase is on the case.

41:55.372 --> 41:57.339
Arf! Flares!

41:59.233 --> 42:02.377
I feel the need
for super speed.

42:24.467 --> 42:27.930
This intersection is closed!

42:27.930 --> 42:29.635
<i>I've got a visual
on the runway.</i>

42:30.605 --> 42:32.572
All right, let's do this.

42:36.710 --> 42:41.680
Close your eyes and listen to
the calming sound of my voice.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.456
I'm on final approach.

42:51.494 --> 42:52.592
Oh, no.

42:56.563 --> 42:57.795
I'm going under!

43:00.833 --> 43:01.964
Whoa!

43:05.134 --> 43:09.268
Come on, baby.
Soft landing. Soft landing.

43:11.976 --> 43:14.317
Oof! Okay, hard landing.

43:18.081 --> 43:19.047
Whoa.

43:21.489 --> 43:23.953
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:35.096 --> 43:37.505
Now that's a nice parking job.

43:51.180 --> 43:52.982
They're back.
Come on. They're back.

43:52.982 --> 43:54.819
Awesome!
Yeah!

43:55.316 --> 43:56.359
How'd it go?

43:56.856 --> 43:58.218
Not good.

43:58.218 --> 44:00.759
Come on. You guys
are the Mighty Pups.

44:00.759 --> 44:04.059
How bad could it be?
It was a trap.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.028
Skye's crystal was stolen.

44:06.701 --> 44:07.766
Oh.

44:07.766 --> 44:10.131
So, really, really not good.

44:26.215 --> 44:29.524
Hey, Skye. You doing okay?

44:29.524 --> 44:32.351
I can't believe
I lost my crystal.

44:32.351 --> 44:35.057
It could have happened
to any one of us.

44:35.057 --> 44:38.566
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

44:43.230 --> 44:46.365
When I was born,
I was the runt
of the litter.

44:46.365 --> 44:47.938
Do you know
what that means?

44:47.938 --> 44:50.072
That you were
the smallest?

44:50.072 --> 44:52.679
The smallest
and the weakest.

45:04.055 --> 45:05.923
<i>It's not easy
being the smallest.</i>

45:09.764 --> 45:12.732
<i>You learn pretty early on
that everything's gonna be
harder for you.</i>

45:30.015 --> 45:33.247
<i>When you're the smallest,
you're always picked last.</i>

45:38.793 --> 45:41.596
<i>And sometimes
you're never picked at all.</i>

45:57.647 --> 46:01.517
<i>Eventually,
I realized that
if I wanted a better life,</i>

46:01.517 --> 46:03.915
<i>I needed to take matters
into my own hands.</i>

46:21.495 --> 46:23.198
No! Come back!

46:52.163 --> 46:54.537
I've got you. It's okay.

46:56.497 --> 46:58.002
Let's get you
out of the cold.

47:06.012 --> 47:10.685
I shouldn't even be in
the PAW Patrol. Ryder didn't
want another pup.

47:10.685 --> 47:13.853
And if he did,
he sure wouldn't have picked
one as small as me.

47:14.691 --> 47:16.152
I had no idea.

47:17.991 --> 47:21.157
When I had superpowers,
for the first time in my life

47:21.157 --> 47:23.896
I didn't feel
like the smallest
and the weakest.

47:25.900 --> 47:28.362
I'd do anything
to get that crystal back.

47:42.081 --> 47:45.511
Amazing.
That's your best time yet!

47:45.511 --> 47:47.953
Hey, Liberty.
Can I talk to you
for a second?

47:49.088 --> 47:51.418
Okay, puffballs, take five.

47:51.418 --> 47:54.058
Better yet, take zero.
Do some push-ups.

47:59.195 --> 48:03.562
I'm telling you, Ryder,
these puffballs
are the real deal.

48:03.562 --> 48:07.533
Liberty, we've got to end
the Junior Patroller program.

48:07.533 --> 48:10.206
What?
It's too dangerous.

48:10.206 --> 48:12.747
Skye's superpowers have fallen
into the wrong hands,

48:12.747 --> 48:15.508
and we have no idea
what's coming.

48:15.508 --> 48:17.609
But the puffballs can help.

48:17.609 --> 48:19.248
Sure, they're little,
but I've heard you say,

48:19.248 --> 48:23.021
"No pup's too small,"
like, a million times.

48:23.021 --> 48:25.991
I know the Junior Patrollers
mean the world to you,

48:25.991 --> 48:29.027
but for now,
we need to keep them safe.

48:29.027 --> 48:31.799
That means we need
to send them home.

48:31.799 --> 48:33.999
Do you want to tell them
or should I?

48:35.200 --> 48:36.639
Tell us what?

48:40.667 --> 48:45.241
Nano, Mini, Tot,
I've got some tough news.

48:45.241 --> 48:47.573
I'm ending
the Junior Patroller program.

48:47.573 --> 48:48.981
What?

48:48.981 --> 48:51.181
No.
I'm sorry.

48:51.181 --> 48:54.382
Hopefully, we can
start it again when
things are safe.

48:55.187 --> 48:56.824
When is that gonna be?

48:58.454 --> 48:59.618
I don't know.

49:17.044 --> 49:21.673
Ryder, I'm sorry
I lost my crystal.

49:21.673 --> 49:26.249
It's not your fault.
I never should have
sent you up there alone.

49:26.249 --> 49:27.822
I just keep thinking,

49:27.822 --> 49:31.353
if I wasn't so small,
I could've stopped them
from taking it.

49:31.353 --> 49:34.455
Don't be so hard on yourself.
We're gonna get it back.

49:34.455 --> 49:37.524
I've set the computer to scan
the city sector by sector,

49:37.524 --> 49:39.999
looking for the energy
signature of the crystal.

49:39.999 --> 49:43.035
Just say the word,
I'm ready to go.

49:43.035 --> 49:46.973
Skye, I'm gonna need
you to stay behind
on this mission.

49:46.973 --> 49:48.304
What?

49:48.304 --> 49:50.306
You don't have
superpowers anymore.

49:51.045 --> 49:54.376
But I have to do something.

49:54.376 --> 49:57.016
My job is to keep you safe.

49:57.016 --> 50:00.151
Until we get
that crystal back,
I need you to stay here.

50:00.151 --> 50:02.483
That's not fair.

50:02.483 --> 50:05.453
I'm sorry, Skye.
But my decision is final.

50:06.390 --> 50:07.829
Try and get some rest.

50:34.682 --> 50:35.857
Finally.

50:36.957 --> 50:39.223
I wonder what
my superpower will be.

50:39.223 --> 50:40.290
Ooh!

50:40.290 --> 50:42.523
Ow!
Don't touch.

50:47.761 --> 50:49.596
Ooh!

50:49.596 --> 50:50.729
It tingles.

50:53.404 --> 50:56.669
I have the power
to control electricity.

51:00.983 --> 51:04.578
For someone who hates
being called a mad scientist,

51:04.578 --> 51:06.987
this is not helping
your image!

51:09.288 --> 51:11.387
I'm just gonna
stand over here.

51:13.457 --> 51:18.130
This is incredible!
I can feel the energy
surging through me!

51:21.762 --> 51:22.937
Stop that!

51:22.937 --> 51:26.369
The static electricity
is ruining my moustache.

51:27.799 --> 51:31.044
And look what it's done
to the kitties!

51:31.044 --> 51:34.773
The problem with
the Meteor Magnet was
it never had enough power.

51:34.773 --> 51:36.412
But now look at me.

51:36.412 --> 51:38.183
I just need to make
a few modifications,

51:38.183 --> 51:40.955
and I can give it
all the power it needs.

51:42.550 --> 51:46.587
I'll finally be able to catch
all the meteors I want!

51:46.587 --> 51:49.656
Why on earth do you need
more meteors?

51:49.656 --> 51:52.230
You saw what kind of power
was in the first one.

51:52.230 --> 51:54.100
Who knows what else
is out there?

52:02.044 --> 52:03.571
<i>Energy signature detected.</i>

52:04.442 --> 52:06.013
<i>Energy signature detected.</i>

52:06.013 --> 52:07.883
My crystal.

52:21.360 --> 52:25.395
If I'm gonna get
my crystal back, I'm gonna
need all the power I can get.

52:51.025 --> 52:52.620
That's all of them.

52:52.620 --> 52:55.227
I'll have these crystals
back before anyone knows
they're gone.

53:16.910 --> 53:19.922
Gotcha. Switching engines
to stealth mode.

54:34.425 --> 54:35.492
Oh, no, you don't!

54:40.860 --> 54:41.927
Ta-ta.

54:43.964 --> 54:45.040
Get back here!

54:56.614 --> 54:58.680
Is that really as fast
as you can go?

55:08.162 --> 55:11.693
Oh, do you need me
to slow down so you
can keep up, little pup?

55:23.146 --> 55:24.112
Oh!

55:28.347 --> 55:32.153
You're so predictable.
Let me out of here!

55:32.153 --> 55:34.815
Not so super inside
a force field, are you?

55:41.626 --> 55:43.428
Don't feel bad
for losing.

55:43.428 --> 55:46.926
People have been
underestimating me
my entire life.

55:49.271 --> 55:50.864
Thanks for the crystals, though.

55:52.769 --> 55:54.208
No!

56:03.417 --> 56:06.286
Time to put all of
this power to work!

56:07.256 --> 56:08.321
Ha!

56:35.216 --> 56:36.811
This is incredible!

56:36.811 --> 56:39.913
I can reach further into space
than ever before.

56:39.913 --> 56:42.421
Stop! What you're doing
is dangerous.

56:42.421 --> 56:43.785
People could get hurt.

56:47.426 --> 56:51.727
And why should I care
about other people?
They never cared about me.

56:51.727 --> 56:54.026
No matter how smart I was,

56:54.026 --> 56:58.899
they laughed at me
and called me a mad scientist.

56:58.899 --> 57:01.572
So, I took matters
into my own hands.

57:01.572 --> 57:03.937
I promised myself
I'd never let anyone

57:03.937 --> 57:09.448
make me feel small
and insignificant ever again.

57:09.448 --> 57:12.110
I'm sorry that
happened to you.

57:12.110 --> 57:14.948
Oh, what would you
know about anything?
You're just a dog.

57:17.051 --> 57:21.152
I know what
it's like to feel small
and insignificant.

57:21.152 --> 57:26.091
Like you have to work
twice as hard as everyone else
just to prove you belong.

57:26.091 --> 57:29.567
That's why I risked everything
to get my crystal back.

57:29.567 --> 57:33.164
But all I did
was make things worse.

57:33.164 --> 57:35.705
Turns out I am too small
to make a difference.

57:40.611 --> 57:43.383
Ooh!

57:43.383 --> 57:46.716
That was good. I know
what you're trying to do.

57:46.716 --> 57:51.292
We have a little
bonding moment,
I get all soft and blubbery,

57:51.292 --> 57:53.855
then I have a change of heart
and let you go?

57:53.855 --> 57:55.263
Well, it's never gonna happen!

57:56.363 --> 57:59.366
Who are you talking to?
Ooh, is that Skye?

58:00.094 --> 58:01.830
Humdinger.

58:01.830 --> 58:04.569
She was kind enough
to bring me the rest
of the crystals.

58:04.569 --> 58:06.307
Aren't they beautiful?

58:06.307 --> 58:10.542
Now remember, we had a deal.
One of those crystals is mine.

58:10.542 --> 58:12.412
Ugh! Fine.
A deal's a deal.

58:13.074 --> 58:14.744
Oh! Oh! Ah!

58:16.044 --> 58:18.209
Oh, my goodness.
I can talk!

58:19.518 --> 58:21.421
I have so much to say!

58:21.421 --> 58:22.785
Give me that crystal!

58:24.589 --> 58:27.889
How do I turn this thing on?
Come on, superpowers.

58:28.727 --> 58:30.397
Ahhh!

58:31.499 --> 58:32.531
Wow!

58:32.531 --> 58:35.765
Oh!

58:47.106 --> 58:49.009
Would you look at that?

58:51.816 --> 58:56.082
Ooh, I always
knew I'd make it big
in Adventure City.

58:56.082 --> 59:00.251
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to pay a visit
to the PAW Patrol.

59:00.251 --> 59:03.925
Those pups and I have got some
unfinished business.

59:07.060 --> 59:08.193
Oh, no.

59:11.770 --> 59:14.375
Ryder! Ryder! Ryder!

59:14.375 --> 59:16.971
Skye's gone.
She took the crystals!

59:16.971 --> 59:18.137
What?

59:24.244 --> 59:26.618
Skye, this is Ryder. Come in.

59:26.618 --> 59:28.818
Skye, this is Ryder.
Do you read me?

59:33.625 --> 59:36.155
The computer found
the missing crystal.

59:36.155 --> 59:37.728
She must've gone after it.

59:37.728 --> 59:39.224
Oh, no.

59:39.224 --> 59:41.567
Come on, pups.
Skye needs our help.

59:41.567 --> 59:46.000
How are we supposed
to help Skye if we don't
have our superpowers?

59:46.000 --> 59:48.266
Looks like we're doing this
the old-fashioned way.

59:48.266 --> 59:49.839
Then I'm coming with you.

01:00:00.113 --> 01:00:01.147
What was that?

01:00:04.755 --> 01:00:06.955
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:00:08.926 --> 01:00:10.189
Earthquake!

01:00:11.324 --> 01:00:12.994
I don't think
that's an earthquake.

01:00:15.636 --> 01:00:16.833
Well, well, well.

01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:20.199
If it isn't my old friends,
the PAW Patrol.

01:00:20.806 --> 01:00:21.970
Humdinger.

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:23.873
He looks different
than I remember.

01:00:25.008 --> 01:00:26.106
I'm stuck!

01:00:32.521 --> 01:00:33.982
Gotcha.
Go!

01:00:38.461 --> 01:00:40.428
Spread out
and don't get stepped on.

01:00:44.795 --> 01:00:47.127
Hold still
so I can squash you.

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:51.538
Get out of the road!

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:57.709
What kind of heartless monster
steps on an ice cream truck?

01:01:02.681 --> 01:01:06.278
Ah, there's nothing better
than a day at the salon.

01:01:09.985 --> 01:01:11.591
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

01:01:11.591 --> 01:01:13.219
Arf! Sidecar!

01:01:19.194 --> 01:01:20.193
Hey!

01:01:26.267 --> 01:01:29.543
Hey, I know you.
You're in the PAW Patrol.

01:01:29.543 --> 01:01:31.369
I was thinking
maybe I should join.

01:01:31.369 --> 01:01:34.141
I mean, not to do
the rescues or anything, obviously,

01:01:34.141 --> 01:01:36.077
but, like,
your social media
or whatever.

01:01:36.077 --> 01:01:38.112
Hang on!

01:01:45.286 --> 01:01:47.253
Sorry about that!

01:01:47.253 --> 01:01:49.893
On second thought,
who needs a job?

01:01:49.893 --> 01:01:51.499
Ew!

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.391
You're not
getting away that easy.

01:01:53.391 --> 01:01:54.436
Ugh!

01:01:55.736 --> 01:01:56.834
Get back here!

01:02:03.777 --> 01:02:05.370
It's a dead end!

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:06.448
Turn around!

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:16.722
Looks like it's the end
of the road, PAW Patrol.

01:02:16.722 --> 01:02:17.789
What do we do?

01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:19.923
I don't know.
We're trapped!

01:02:26.536 --> 01:02:28.998
Junior Patrol is on a roll!

01:02:28.998 --> 01:02:31.033
It's the Junior Patrollers!

01:02:38.942 --> 01:02:40.075
Ahhh!

01:02:40.075 --> 01:02:41.945
What is that?
Get it off! Get it off!

01:02:47.082 --> 01:02:48.754
Operation Allergies.

01:02:48.754 --> 01:02:49.854
Go!

01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:53.528
Ah... Ah... Ah...

01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:55.926
Ah... Ah...

01:02:55.926 --> 01:02:57.598
He's gonna blow!

01:03:09.676 --> 01:03:12.140
Marshall, the crystal's
in his jacket pocket!

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:13.207
I'm on it.

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:22.117
Got it.
Oh, no, you don't!

01:03:22.117 --> 01:03:23.756
Marshall!

01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:27.122
Nobody messes
with Giant Humdinger.

01:03:28.695 --> 01:03:30.158
Ow!

01:03:30.158 --> 01:03:33.634
If you mess with the fire pup,
you're gonna get burned.

01:03:33.634 --> 01:03:36.395
Ooh, that's a hot one-liner.

01:03:36.395 --> 01:03:37.429
He's shrinking!

01:03:48.079 --> 01:03:49.078
Ahhh!

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.016
Whoa! Whoa!

01:03:55.854 --> 01:03:58.626
Humdinger,
you're going back to jail.

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:01.354
Oh, not again.

01:04:03.666 --> 01:04:07.866
That's what I'm talking about.
Lean, mean, fluffy little
rescue machines.

01:04:07.866 --> 01:04:11.232
Hop in, puffballs.
You ride with me.

01:04:16.041 --> 01:04:19.647
Nice work, Marshall.
Let's take that crystal
and go get Skye.

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:39.029
So many meteors,
so little time.

01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:40.063
Ooh!

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:55.540
Can't you read?
The sign says "keep out"!

01:04:58.378 --> 01:05:00.248
Ugh!

01:05:14.737 --> 01:05:16.396
Hello!

01:05:16.396 --> 01:05:19.399
We're going door to door
selling Pup Club cookies.

01:05:19.399 --> 01:05:22.941
Can we interest you
in a sweet and tasty treat?

01:05:22.941 --> 01:05:24.712
I'm listening.
What do you got?

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:31.048
Vance is distracted
at the door.
Zuma, you're up.

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.413
Aye-aye, Ryder, sir.

01:05:35.989 --> 01:05:39.419
We got plain,
sprinkles, caramel...

01:05:43.293 --> 01:05:45.359
No. No. Pass.
Spicy ginger...

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.426
Ooh!

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.670
Surf's up.

01:06:02.345 --> 01:06:06.281
So, we can't eat
chocolate, but we'll take
your word for it.

01:06:06.281 --> 01:06:07.953
We'll take your order now,

01:06:07.953 --> 01:06:11.022
and you will get your cookies
in six to eight weeks.

01:06:12.421 --> 01:06:13.695
That seems
like a long time.

01:06:16.194 --> 01:06:19.833
Skye? Skye? Where are you?

01:06:20.363 --> 01:06:21.395
Zuma?

01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:27.566
Oh, it's good to see you.
Time to bust out of here.

01:06:31.341 --> 01:06:32.747
Power paws.

01:06:36.346 --> 01:06:39.182
Oh, I don't think so.

01:06:47.058 --> 01:06:51.898
Only one of you has powers!
Ha! You're no match for me!

01:06:54.661 --> 01:06:56.265
We're a team.

01:06:56.265 --> 01:06:59.169
When you go up
against one of us,
you go up against all of us.

01:06:59.169 --> 01:07:00.632
Fine. Have it your way.

01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:04.075
Chase!
Got it.

01:07:04.075 --> 01:07:05.142
Marshall!

01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:19.717
Coming in hot!

01:07:37.174 --> 01:07:38.175
Rocky!

01:07:41.178 --> 01:07:42.245
Look out!

01:07:48.517 --> 01:07:50.715
Keep your hands off
our vehicles.

01:07:50.715 --> 01:07:52.486
You tell her, Rocky!

01:07:54.127 --> 01:07:55.126
Rubble!

01:07:57.623 --> 01:07:59.229
Power paws!

01:08:09.571 --> 01:08:10.977
Skye!
On it.

01:08:11.573 --> 01:08:12.737
Oh, no, you don't.

01:08:15.775 --> 01:08:16.774
Chase!

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:39.005
Look at me.

01:08:39.005 --> 01:08:41.205
I'm... I'm stretchy!

01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:45.209
That's my superpower!
I'm elastic and fantastic.

01:08:45.209 --> 01:08:47.376
Uh, Liberty?

01:08:47.376 --> 01:08:49.807
Can you please
get us out of here?
No problem.

01:08:54.317 --> 01:08:56.187
Nice catch, Liberty!

01:08:56.187 --> 01:09:00.158
I've been trying
to be more flexible,
but this is ridiculous.

01:09:00.158 --> 01:09:03.227
All right, puppies,
playtime's over!

01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:05.196
Give me back
that crystal!

01:09:06.364 --> 01:09:07.363
Zuma!

01:09:16.506 --> 01:09:19.243
Where'd he go?
Over here, dude!

01:09:20.345 --> 01:09:21.916
You got to be
faster than that.

01:09:23.909 --> 01:09:25.744
You can't hide forever!

01:09:30.619 --> 01:09:31.783
Huh?

01:09:39.727 --> 01:09:41.969
These crystals
belong to us, dude.

01:09:43.236 --> 01:09:44.334
No!

01:09:59.285 --> 01:10:02.715
It's time to shut down
that Meteor Magnet
once and for all.

01:10:04.752 --> 01:10:08.391
Hey, Rubble.
Want to go for a ride?

01:10:08.391 --> 01:10:10.558
Teamwork makes
the dream work.

01:10:13.926 --> 01:10:17.103
No! No! Stop!
What are you doing?
Fire!

01:10:19.767 --> 01:10:20.898
No!

01:10:25.806 --> 01:10:28.345
Oh, yeah.
How do you like me now?

01:10:33.119 --> 01:10:36.155
Victoria Vance,
you are under arrest.

01:10:36.751 --> 01:10:38.058
Ooh!

01:10:38.058 --> 01:10:40.720
You're in big trouble!

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.392
You'll have to
catch me first!

01:10:43.395 --> 01:10:44.922
Where do you think
you're going?

01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:56.109
You mangy mutts
think you're so smart,

01:10:56.109 --> 01:11:00.047
but those meteors
are coming down whether
you like it or not.

01:11:01.411 --> 01:11:02.940
She's telling the truth.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:05.316
There's hundreds of meteors
heading straight for the city.

01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:09.683
What have you done?
What can I say?

01:11:09.683 --> 01:11:12.851
I guess I am a mad scientist.

01:11:16.362 --> 01:11:18.824
Finally, she admits it.

01:11:18.824 --> 01:11:21.266
Skye, I need you
to fly up there

01:11:21.266 --> 01:11:24.962
and destroy as many
of those meteors as you can.

01:11:24.962 --> 01:11:28.636
You still believe in me after
everything that's happened?

01:11:28.636 --> 01:11:31.507
I've always believed
in you, Skye.

01:11:31.507 --> 01:11:34.609
You're the reason I started
saying, "No pup's too small."

01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:39.119
I'll give it
everything I got, Ryder.

01:11:40.518 --> 01:11:42.012
Wait.

01:11:42.012 --> 01:11:44.949
If you're going up
against those meteors,

01:11:44.949 --> 01:11:47.094
you better take
all the power you can get.

01:12:03.838 --> 01:12:05.343
We believe in you, Skye.

01:12:06.511 --> 01:12:07.873
I won't let you down.

01:12:12.847 --> 01:12:14.583
Let's take to the sky.

01:12:17.522 --> 01:12:21.018
Okay, pups, we've got a city
to evacuate. Let's move!

01:12:42.679 --> 01:12:43.744
Where are you?

01:12:47.453 --> 01:12:49.354
There you are.

01:12:49.354 --> 01:12:51.455
Activating targeting computer.

01:12:56.264 --> 01:12:57.461
Let's do this.

01:13:00.763 --> 01:13:01.762
Fire!

01:13:19.188 --> 01:13:20.880
Time to turn and burn.

01:13:39.736 --> 01:13:41.472
Oh!

01:13:41.472 --> 01:13:42.737
I'm hit!

01:13:42.737 --> 01:13:44.772
<i>Skye, are you okay?</i>

01:13:44.772 --> 01:13:47.412
I'm fine, but I'm gonna
have to ditch my jet.

01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.821
All right, space rocks,
what do you got?

01:14:20.645 --> 01:14:23.613
<i>There are meteors headed
directly for Adventure City.</i>

01:14:23.613 --> 01:14:28.618
<i>Evacuate the area immediately.
I repeat, evacuate the area!</i>

01:14:28.618 --> 01:14:32.490
Keep moving, everybody.
Only bring what's
absolutely necessary!

01:14:33.724 --> 01:14:34.822
Come on, Skye.

01:14:52.974 --> 01:14:55.315
That's all of them.
The sky is clear.

01:14:57.449 --> 01:14:58.945
No, it's not.

01:14:58.945 --> 01:15:01.552
Skye, there's
a huge meteor incoming.

01:15:03.688 --> 01:15:04.918
I don't see anything.

01:15:06.394 --> 01:15:07.525
Wait a second.

01:15:15.029 --> 01:15:16.028
Oh, no.

01:15:21.607 --> 01:15:24.003
Skye, you've got
to get out of there!

01:15:26.843 --> 01:15:30.174
I can't do that, Ryder.
I have to try.

01:15:30.174 --> 01:15:33.254
<i>Save yourself, Skye!
That meteor's too big!</i>

01:15:40.395 --> 01:15:41.691
No pup's too small.

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:09.048
No pup's too small!

01:16:15.397 --> 01:16:16.924
No pup's too small!

01:16:29.642 --> 01:16:30.872
Skye!

01:16:52.698 --> 01:16:53.961
Skye!

01:16:54.326 --> 01:16:56.799
Skye!

01:16:58.407 --> 01:16:59.472
Skye!

01:17:19.494 --> 01:17:20.988
Wait. What's that?

01:17:32.166 --> 01:17:33.737
Whoa!

01:17:37.479 --> 01:17:39.105
You see that right there?

01:17:39.105 --> 01:17:40.546
That's why she's
my favorite pup.

01:17:42.682 --> 01:17:44.044
Yeah, Skye!

01:17:44.044 --> 01:17:45.782
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

01:17:45.782 --> 01:17:48.246
That was amazing.

01:17:49.216 --> 01:17:51.051
I'm so proud of you, Skye.

01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:53.152
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:58.795
I don't believe it.
She did it. Yeah!

01:18:01.932 --> 01:18:03.162
Whoo-hoo!

01:18:03.162 --> 01:18:05.395
Way to go,
PAW Patrol!

01:18:11.205 --> 01:18:14.239
Give it up for Skye
and the Mighty Pups!

01:18:32.226 --> 01:18:36.162
<i>We are the Mighty Pups,
defenders of Adventure City</i>

01:18:36.162 --> 01:18:39.132
<i>and guardians of all
that's good in the world.</i>

01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:41.101
<i>With these superpowers
comes a duty</i>

01:18:41.101 --> 01:18:44.577
<i>to protect all those
who need our help.</i>

01:18:44.577 --> 01:18:46.810
<i>Our promise is to always
do what's right</i>

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:49.208
<i>and stop at nothing
to keep the world safe.</i>

01:18:50.079 --> 01:18:52.079
<i>Because even the smallest pup</i>

01:18:56.052 --> 01:18:57.788
<i>can make
the biggest difference.</i>

01:19:00.628 --> 01:19:02.529
No rescue's too big...

01:19:03.695 --> 01:19:05.059
No pup's too small.
