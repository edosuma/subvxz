00:00.219 --> 00:01.453
Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

00:01.520 --> 00:03.288
Gary and I just found
something that is huge.

00:03.469 --> 00:05.284
- Stanton Parish.
- This is from the Civil War.

00:05.368 --> 00:06.835
He was about
40 years old, right?

00:06.903 --> 00:09.804
Same guy,
100 years later.

00:09.872 --> 00:12.717
War
it's inevitable,

00:12.785 --> 00:14.554
in two years, maybe three.

00:14.622 --> 00:16.625
Nothing that you or I
can do to stop that.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:32.345 --> 00:34.849
Bill, you all right?

00:40.391 --> 00:44.526
It's too early.

00:44.594 --> 00:46.598
Come back to bed
and warm me up.

00:48.068 --> 00:50.503
In fact, you know what?
Why don't we both call in sick--

00:50.571 --> 00:53.673
No, no. I-
I-I've got to go to work.

00:55.408 --> 00:57.576
Bill, you need a break.

00:57.643 --> 00:58.777
You've been so stressed,

00:58.845 --> 01:00.078
and those pills
are not working anymore.

01:00.145 --> 01:03.982
Jeannie, I--

01:04.049 --> 01:05.584
Jeannie, I got this.

01:05.653 --> 01:09.489
Okay?

01:09.557 --> 01:12.393
I gotta go.

01:30.748 --> 01:33.049
Gary?
Breakfast.

01:33.116 --> 01:36.085
In a minute.

02:07.521 --> 02:10.424
It sounds to me like it's
a cathartic release, Sandra.

02:10.491 --> 02:12.994
It's releasing some tension
and some stress, you know?

02:13.062 --> 02:14.763
It's--it's basically
a coping mechanism.

02:14.831 --> 02:16.565
No, I-it's happening
every day, Lee.

02:16.632 --> 02:17.599
That's not coping.

02:17.668 --> 02:19.101
They locked him up.

02:19.169 --> 02:21.737
They put a metal chip
in his head, for God's sake.

02:21.805 --> 02:23.273
He's gone back to work
way too soon.

02:23.340 --> 02:25.742
Well, Sandra,
Gary needs to work.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.210
It's good for him,
you know that.

02:27.278 --> 02:29.112
He really needs
to talk to somebody

02:29.180 --> 02:30.514
about what happened to him.

02:30.582 --> 02:32.650
Listen, I-I'm on my way
to pick him up now.

02:32.718 --> 02:35.287
I'll find some time today
to speak with him.

02:35.354 --> 02:39.525
I mean, you know
that I love my parents to death,

02:39.593 --> 02:41.561
but they're all over me again.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.164
I mean, all of the sudden,
it's like, "where are you going?

02:44.232 --> 02:45.366
"How late are you
gonna be at work?

02:45.433 --> 02:46.600
Are you being safe?"

02:46.668 --> 02:48.703
They need to understand
that I'm an adult

02:48.770 --> 02:50.405
and that I'm gonna do
what I want to do.

02:50.472 --> 02:51.439
I'm gonna do
what I want to do.

02:51.507 --> 02:52.707
Yeah, exactly, Gary.

02:52.775 --> 02:54.442
Well, perhaps
you should look into getting

02:54.510 --> 02:55.811
your own apartment again.

02:55.879 --> 02:57.179
Yeah, I thought about it,

02:57.247 --> 02:58.681
but after everything
that happened last year--

02:58.748 --> 03:00.382
- Nathan.
Yes, what is it?

03:00.450 --> 03:02.117
Hi, yeah, what's up?

03:02.185 --> 03:04.720
- What is that smell?
- What happened?

03:04.788 --> 03:07.223
I smell nice.
I smell like a washing machine.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.192
No, it's not you, Gary.
Someone reeks of cologne.

03:11.595 --> 03:14.563
Hicks!

03:14.631 --> 03:15.998
What are you doing?

03:16.066 --> 03:17.900
Harken.

03:17.968 --> 03:19.201
Hello, Rachel.

03:19.269 --> 03:21.504
Listen up, old spice,
I will hose you down.

03:21.572 --> 03:23.105
What are you talking about?
You know, that's not me.

03:23.173 --> 03:24.707
You've got perfect timing.
Meet John Bennett.

03:24.774 --> 03:27.443
This is Rosen's new choice
for our lead tactical.

03:27.511 --> 03:28.744
Rachel Pirzad.

03:28.812 --> 03:31.714
Rachel,
I've heard a lot about you.

03:33.550 --> 03:35.986
- What did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.

03:36.053 --> 03:37.654
But if I did,
I would've told him

03:37.722 --> 03:39.623
all of the good stuff.

03:39.691 --> 03:42.527
So you're gonna
be working here now?

03:42.594 --> 03:44.896
Only on an as-needed basis,
but, yeah.

03:44.964 --> 03:48.934
Well, on an as-needed basis,

03:49.002 --> 03:52.304
you need to know that
your body spray or whatever

03:52.372 --> 03:54.073
is--

03:54.141 --> 03:55.408
it's way too distracting.

03:55.476 --> 03:57.911
It's not that you smell,
exactly, ju--

03:57.979 --> 03:59.679
Rachel, Bill.

03:59.747 --> 04:02.115
Hello, John.
Welcome.

04:02.183 --> 04:03.416
Thank you, sir.

04:03.484 --> 04:05.786
Cley just called.
An Alpha's been killed.

04:05.853 --> 04:07.120
We need you to go.

04:11.192 --> 04:14.328
Jack Duffy--

04:14.395 --> 04:16.130
Building Seven escapee.

04:16.197 --> 04:19.099
He can generate electricity
in his bare hands.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.236
Those look
like chemical burns.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.671
There's an extremely
high concentration

04:23.739 --> 04:25.239
of hydrochloric acid.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.308
Did someone pour it on him?

04:27.376 --> 04:29.578
No, more like
spit it at him.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.748
The acid is mixed
with the attacker's saliva.

04:35.184 --> 04:37.352
So you can smell
this guy's spit?

04:37.419 --> 04:39.354
Hey, saliva has
a very distinctive smell.

04:39.422 --> 04:41.056
That's cool.
It's poison spit.

04:41.123 --> 04:42.524
- Yeah.
- It's like a cobra.

04:42.592 --> 04:44.092
I like that.
He didn't like it, though,

04:44.160 --> 04:45.593
'cause it melted his--

04:45.661 --> 04:48.563
I-I'm being inappropriate.

04:48.631 --> 04:50.532
Check out these hands.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.267
There's some skin
under the nails.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.469
He definitely put up a fight.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.308
So we're saying
another Alpha killed him?

05:04.013 --> 05:05.513
Unh!

05:05.581 --> 05:07.615
Rachel, there's something
written on his hand.

05:07.683 --> 05:08.583
Can you take a look at that?

05:10.752 --> 05:12.353
Oh, yeah,
that's a phone number.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.087
718...

05:14.155 --> 05:15.689
555...

05:15.756 --> 05:17.424
0012.

05:21.194 --> 05:22.461
It's a voice mail.

05:22.529 --> 05:24.463
"Delivery.

05:24.531 --> 05:25.965
"8:00 p.m. tonight.

05:26.033 --> 05:27.767
"286 Crawford.

05:27.835 --> 05:28.769
Bolivia."

05:28.836 --> 05:30.003
Bolivia?

05:30.071 --> 05:32.272
- What kind of delivery?
- Didn't say.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.041
No, Bill, there's
no "Crawford" in Bolivia.

05:34.109 --> 05:36.411
It's not even Spanish.

05:36.478 --> 05:38.479
There's--there's
a "Cristo" in Caracas.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.016
Bill, would you take point
on this, please?

05:41.083 --> 05:42.817
Maybe you can find someone

05:42.885 --> 05:44.352
who knows what happened
to Mr. Duffy.

05:44.420 --> 05:46.053
- That's what I do.
- Good.

05:46.121 --> 05:48.089
I need to keep looking
for Parish.

05:48.157 --> 05:49.390
Gary, come with me, please.

05:56.331 --> 05:59.667
This is 286 Crawford, but...

05:59.734 --> 06:02.169
this definitely
isn't Bolivia.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.041
There's a lot
of heartbeats inside.

06:07.109 --> 06:09.877
People are yelling
and cheering.

06:09.945 --> 06:11.879
Maybe squatters.

06:11.947 --> 06:13.380
Happy squatters?

06:13.448 --> 06:16.784
Rachel, do you smell
that acid?

06:16.851 --> 06:19.286
It's hard to tell.
Um, I need to get a closer look.

06:19.354 --> 06:21.222
No, no, no.
Area's not secure.

06:21.289 --> 06:22.523
I'm gonna go check it out.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.624
I'll cover the street.

06:23.691 --> 06:25.259
You stay with me, okay?
What?

06:25.327 --> 06:27.295
- Yeah, let's go.
- Bill!

06:27.362 --> 06:28.563
No, he's lead tactical
now, Rachel.

06:28.630 --> 06:30.498
Stay with him.

07:00.860 --> 07:01.827
Who are you?

07:01.894 --> 07:03.762
286 Crawford?

07:03.830 --> 07:05.230
What about it?

07:06.566 --> 07:07.466
Bolivia.

07:07.533 --> 07:10.336
So you're a fighter?

07:10.404 --> 07:11.771
You got skills?

07:13.540 --> 07:14.874
Wouldn't be here
if I didn't.

07:14.942 --> 07:18.412
Well, we'll see.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.748
Smooth talker.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.216
Well, it got us in here,
didn't it?

07:22.284 --> 07:25.119
Into what?

07:28.056 --> 07:29.590
Well,
from the looks of things,

07:29.658 --> 07:33.862
this is probably where Duffy
got that blood on his knuckles,

07:33.929 --> 07:37.265
so...we need to find out.

07:37.333 --> 07:40.734
Split up.
Yeah.

07:42.637 --> 07:44.704
You okay?

07:44.772 --> 07:47.340
Yeah, I just--

07:47.408 --> 07:49.909
I thought I caught a whiff
of his scent, and--

07:49.977 --> 07:51.277
Well, what's wrong?

07:53.614 --> 07:56.182
What's wrong is, John,
is that you stink, okay?

07:56.250 --> 07:58.484
My eyes are watering.
My nose is burning.

07:58.552 --> 08:00.720
It's like a spice rack
exploded in my face.

08:00.788 --> 08:02.422
No, Rachel, Rachel,
you can't go out there.

08:02.490 --> 08:03.690
I actually
have to do my job,

08:03.758 --> 08:05.592
so can you please
just stay in the car?

08:05.660 --> 08:06.793
Rachel.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.129
Thank you.

08:11.265 --> 08:13.700
Hicks, I can smell it--

08:13.768 --> 08:14.968
hydrochloric acid.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.871
Want to narrow that down
a little bit?

08:17.939 --> 08:20.774
Not yet. It's faint,
but the killer's here.

08:49.271 --> 08:51.874
I'm sorry.
I thought, um--

08:51.941 --> 08:55.210
You thought what?

08:55.278 --> 08:57.880
Oh, wow.
That's an acid burn.

08:57.947 --> 08:59.114
Looks like
it must have hurt.

08:59.182 --> 09:01.350
Some piece of crap
spit at me,

09:01.418 --> 09:03.453
soon as he knew
I could beat him.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.088
That piece of crap,
what--what was his name?

09:05.156 --> 09:06.957
Bazevich.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.425
You know,
you're pretty cute.

09:08.493 --> 09:09.593
What's your name?

09:09.661 --> 09:11.962
Hey!

09:12.030 --> 09:13.196
Everything okay here?

09:13.264 --> 09:14.898
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, it's good.

09:14.966 --> 09:17.067
Hey, um,
the Bazevich guy, huh?

09:17.135 --> 09:18.502
We came to see him fight.

09:18.570 --> 09:20.504
I've been waiting for him
all night,

09:20.572 --> 09:21.672
and when he shows,

09:21.740 --> 09:24.041
I will kick his ass.

09:24.108 --> 09:25.842
You come and watch that.

09:25.910 --> 09:28.445
Huh, little girl?

09:28.512 --> 09:29.445
Sweet guy.

09:29.513 --> 09:31.648
Tell me about it.

09:31.715 --> 09:33.349
- You okay?
- Yeah.

09:33.417 --> 09:38.587
Hey, thanks...
For not staying in the van.

09:44.861 --> 09:47.029
All right, who's next?

09:47.097 --> 09:50.633
Step up! Step up!
Who is next?

09:50.701 --> 09:52.735
You! Hotshot!

09:52.803 --> 09:55.038
Okay, no time-outs,

09:55.105 --> 09:56.439
last man standing
gets the win.

09:56.507 --> 09:58.274
Your knee touches the ground,
you lose.

09:58.342 --> 10:01.478
No, I thought I'd just
check it out first time.

10:01.546 --> 10:03.213
Yeah, well,
you figured wrong.

10:03.281 --> 10:05.248
First-timers gotta fight.

Your friend thinks
he's a tough guy.

10:46.485 --> 10:47.885
Trust me,
short stack, he is.

10:47.953 --> 10:49.921
- He's gonna get his ass kicked.
- Yeah, right.

10:52.792 --> 10:54.393
Aah!

10:55.728 --> 10:56.895
What's the problem,
old man?

10:56.963 --> 10:58.898
The son of a bitch
is all over the place.

10:58.965 --> 10:59.966
I can't hit him.

11:00.033 --> 11:01.267
You see that dude?

11:01.335 --> 11:02.802
He messes with your eyes.

11:02.869 --> 11:04.937
Like a camera flash
going off in your face--

11:05.005 --> 11:06.471
makes you see
all double and triple.

11:06.539 --> 11:07.839
How the hell's he do that?

11:07.907 --> 11:10.342
He's got a special talent.

11:10.409 --> 11:11.676
All the fighters do.

11:11.744 --> 11:13.911
They're Alphas.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.466
Jacob Dunham,
Stanton Parish.

11:36.534 --> 11:38.335
There's no connection.

11:38.403 --> 11:39.903
Jacob Dunham,
Stanton Parish.

11:39.971 --> 11:42.406
Gary, how you doing?
You tired?

11:42.474 --> 11:44.375
You've been at this all day.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.410
Yeah, I've been at it
all day, and I've--

11:46.478 --> 11:47.645
I've found bubkes.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.213
That means "nothing."

11:49.281 --> 11:50.981
It's like "zilch."
I've found zilch.

11:51.049 --> 11:52.683
That's not entirely true.

11:52.751 --> 11:55.820
You found that this picture
is of a Major Jacob Dunham,

11:55.887 --> 11:57.922
and he was treated
by a Doctor Harrison,

11:57.990 --> 12:00.324
who worked
at New York hospital.

12:00.392 --> 12:01.959
- Y-yeah.
- You know, I'm thinking

12:02.026 --> 12:05.229
that if he had continued
to treat Major Dunham,

12:05.296 --> 12:09.867
his notes might still be there
in the hospital records.

12:09.935 --> 12:12.336
So, Gary, I-I hear
you've added a new element

12:12.404 --> 12:13.704
to your morning routine.

12:13.772 --> 12:15.272
You're screaming.

12:16.908 --> 12:19.210
Okay, yeah.

12:19.278 --> 12:21.078
I scream for ten seconds,
but then--

12:21.146 --> 12:25.817
then I go
and have my breakfast.

12:25.884 --> 12:28.886
Or are you angry
about something?

12:28.954 --> 12:30.088
It might help
if you discuss it.

12:30.155 --> 12:32.290
I...no.
I don't want to discuss it.

12:32.357 --> 12:34.959
I scream, so we don't have
to discuss it.

12:35.027 --> 12:36.227
Right, I see.

12:36.295 --> 12:38.963
You know, you have every reason
to be angry.

12:39.031 --> 12:41.665
The government
took you away from your home,

12:41.733 --> 12:47.738
put a chip in your neck--
they killed her.

12:47.805 --> 12:50.040
They killed her--
Anna.

12:50.107 --> 12:52.709
They shot her in the head.
She was my friend.

13:02.953 --> 13:04.453
Gary, it's a--
it's a healthy thing

13:04.521 --> 13:06.255
to express yourself.

13:06.323 --> 13:07.957
I'm glad that you are.

13:08.025 --> 13:11.361
Um, maybe you can find
a way to do it

13:11.429 --> 13:15.733
without terrifying
your mother.

13:20.338 --> 13:23.040
Bill!
Are you okay?

13:23.108 --> 13:24.508
No, I'm not.
Don't worry about it.

13:24.576 --> 13:26.577
What you got for me?

13:26.645 --> 13:27.912
Rachel got the name
of our acid spitter--

13:27.980 --> 13:29.681
Ivan Bazevich...

13:29.748 --> 13:31.549
did a stretch upstate,
no known address.

13:31.617 --> 13:32.517
So how do we find him?

13:32.584 --> 13:35.221
Well, we know he's a fighter.

13:35.288 --> 13:37.123
Hey.

13:37.191 --> 13:40.059
I heard things
got pretty rough last night.

13:40.127 --> 13:42.662
Things get rough every night.
You take your chances.

13:42.730 --> 13:43.796
So when's the next fight?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.565
For you?
Never.

13:45.632 --> 13:47.500
You ain't cut out for this.

13:47.568 --> 13:51.170
Hey, wait.
I-I'll work with him.

13:51.238 --> 13:53.839
- This guy, Kat?
- Guy's got moves.

13:53.907 --> 13:55.708
He just doesn't know
how to use 'em.

13:55.776 --> 13:56.909
Give him another shot.

13:56.977 --> 13:58.210
For you, fine.

13:58.278 --> 14:01.848
But I don't see it.

14:01.915 --> 14:03.550
So I know all their tricks,

14:03.618 --> 14:06.920
so if you want to win
next time,

14:06.988 --> 14:08.889
give me a call.

14:08.956 --> 14:10.190
I'm Kat.

14:10.258 --> 14:11.859
So why do you
want to help me out?

14:11.927 --> 14:14.095
So I can bet on you,
cash in.

14:17.799 --> 14:20.501
Okay, later.

14:34.628 --> 14:36.028
What's all this?

14:36.096 --> 14:38.664
Dr. Rosen said that
I should find a way to scream

14:38.732 --> 14:41.199
without terrifying you,
so I did--I'm moving out.

14:41.267 --> 14:42.534
What?

14:42.601 --> 14:44.302
Yeah, I'm gonna go live
at my office.

14:44.370 --> 14:46.705
What are you talking about?

14:46.772 --> 14:48.006
Sandra,
I know you're upset,

14:48.074 --> 14:51.042
but I did not recommend
that Gary leave home.

14:51.110 --> 14:53.011
No, but that was your solution
for Rachel.

14:53.079 --> 14:55.146
Why's it different for me?
W-why's that not my solution?

14:55.214 --> 14:56.715
Gary, you are not
going anywhere.

14:56.783 --> 14:58.583
I want to do
what I want to do.

14:58.651 --> 15:00.252
You know what? You're not
going to work today either.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.220
Yeah, Mom, come on,
of course I'm going to work.

15:02.288 --> 15:03.455
I go into work every day.

15:03.523 --> 15:04.723
They need me there.
I need you here.

15:04.791 --> 15:06.725
No! You don't need me.
Go in the house.

15:06.793 --> 15:08.127
I'm going to work.

15:08.194 --> 15:10.562
Gary!
Gary, it's, uh--

15:10.630 --> 15:13.065
it's quite all right if you
don't come to work today.

15:13.132 --> 15:14.700
There's nothing urgent,

15:14.768 --> 15:17.803
and if we need you,
w-we'll call.

15:17.871 --> 15:19.772
And I think it would be
a good idea

15:19.839 --> 15:23.609
if we all sat down very soon
and discussed your future.

15:23.677 --> 15:26.145
My future?

15:26.213 --> 15:28.047
Yeah, <i>my</i> future.
Yeah.

15:28.115 --> 15:30.282
Yeah.

15:37.224 --> 15:39.191
We're still focused on
Bazevich as our killer.

15:39.259 --> 15:40.893
We finally got his records
from D.O.D.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.995
Well, are we any closer
to finding this guy?

15:43.062 --> 15:45.430
Cops have been by all his
usual hangouts--no sign of him.

15:45.498 --> 15:46.731
Harken's checking a lead,

15:46.799 --> 15:48.600
but look, if you ask me,
these Alpha fights

15:48.668 --> 15:49.768
are still our best bet.

15:49.835 --> 15:51.436
Just as long
as it's a stakeout

15:51.503 --> 15:53.404
and no more fighting.

15:53.472 --> 15:55.840
I wasn't the one fighting.

15:55.907 --> 15:57.674
To be honest with you,

15:57.742 --> 15:59.176
I don't know
if we can keep him away.

15:59.244 --> 16:00.711
I mean, the guy's
in training right now

16:00.778 --> 16:03.713
for his next fight.

16:03.781 --> 16:06.616
The human nervous system
of the body

16:06.684 --> 16:09.719
sending and receives
while also processing

16:09.787 --> 16:12.856
neurological impulses
throughout our brain.

16:12.923 --> 16:16.626
It controls all physical
and fine motor skills

16:16.694 --> 16:19.328
while also impacting
our thoughts,

16:19.396 --> 16:23.166
emotions,
and cognitive function.

16:23.233 --> 16:27.403
The spinal cord serves as
a telegraphic cable,

16:27.471 --> 16:31.041
sending various messages
throughout the body.

16:31.108 --> 16:33.043
The spine itself measures
approximately

16:33.110 --> 16:35.378
a quarter of an inch
in diameter,

16:35.446 --> 16:38.248
and varies in length
from person to person.

16:38.316 --> 16:40.650
The synaptic impulses...

16:40.718 --> 16:43.453
Are responsible for all sense--

16:43.521 --> 16:44.788
So watch out for that guy,

16:44.855 --> 16:46.189
'cause he'll mess
with your eyes.

16:46.257 --> 16:47.890
And then there's this
other guy, super flexible.

16:47.958 --> 16:49.392
You punch him,
pops right back,

16:49.460 --> 16:51.294
so you gotta drive him
into a corner.

16:51.362 --> 16:53.863
That way, he springs back
and forth against your fists.

16:53.931 --> 16:57.867
What about, um,
that guy that spits acid?

16:57.935 --> 17:00.002
Bazevich?

17:00.070 --> 17:01.771
He's badass, scary as hell.

17:01.838 --> 17:03.205
Okay, pay attention.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.549
So you kickbox too?

17:12.617 --> 17:14.384
No, never have.

17:14.452 --> 17:16.019
Yeah, but you just can't
pick that up right away.

17:16.087 --> 17:18.622
I'm a quick study.

17:18.690 --> 17:21.092
Ahh.
You're an Alpha.

17:21.159 --> 17:22.660
So are we done chatting?

17:22.728 --> 17:24.561
We got a lot of work to do.

17:26.065 --> 17:28.266
Hi.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.434
Um...

17:30.502 --> 17:32.970
so I raided the soap aisle.

17:37.610 --> 17:39.110
I figured
while we're on stakeout,

17:39.178 --> 17:42.413
you should get to at least
choose how I smell...

17:42.481 --> 17:44.615
which really sounded
a whole lot better in my head.

17:44.683 --> 17:46.650
So you actually went
and bought all of these things?

17:46.718 --> 17:48.719
Yeah, I mean,
I thought about unscented,

17:48.787 --> 17:50.955
but I figure nothing's
really unscented to you.

17:51.023 --> 17:52.223
You're right!

17:52.291 --> 17:55.427
There is no such thing
as unscented to me.

17:55.494 --> 17:57.996
Tom's of Maine
is probably the mildest.

17:58.064 --> 17:59.764
Okay.

17:59.832 --> 18:01.933
And thank you.

18:02.001 --> 18:05.604
You're welcome.

18:14.981 --> 18:16.515
Is that it?

18:16.583 --> 18:19.218
I'm not gonna amp up
just for practice.

18:19.285 --> 18:20.686
It's not healthy for me.

18:20.754 --> 18:23.155
Well, my bet...
is using your ability

18:23.223 --> 18:24.590
is not your problem.

18:24.658 --> 18:26.426
It's holding back.

18:26.493 --> 18:28.629
You got all this pressure
all the time that's building up.

18:28.696 --> 18:30.030
That's why you get cranky.

18:30.098 --> 18:32.700
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:32.768 --> 18:35.703
Stop fighting who you are.

18:35.771 --> 18:37.472
Just let it go, man.

18:37.540 --> 18:40.409
What do you want me to do,
huh--sit on the floor,

18:40.477 --> 18:42.844
burn some incense,
say "om"?

18:42.912 --> 18:45.347
As much as I would like
to see that, no.

18:46.783 --> 18:49.817
Harken, you need to relax.

18:49.885 --> 18:52.320
Just try to listen.

18:52.387 --> 18:55.589
Just trust me.

18:55.657 --> 18:58.125
Okay?

18:58.193 --> 19:01.628
There's no reason
to struggle.

19:01.696 --> 19:03.297
There's nothing to control.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.468
You don't have
to reach for it,

19:08.536 --> 19:09.502
'cause it's part of you.

19:11.472 --> 19:15.842
When you want it,
it'll be there.

19:33.462 --> 19:35.563
Told you.

19:39.902 --> 19:42.170
I never thought we'd have
something so ancient.

19:42.238 --> 19:45.874
Dr. Harrison's files were
right there in the archives.

19:45.942 --> 19:47.776
This must be my lucky day.

20:05.996 --> 20:11.600
"It was two years ago,
the 22 of October, 1862,

20:11.668 --> 20:13.301
"it was only my fourth week

20:13.369 --> 20:16.605
"serving with General Wood's
Army of the Cumberland,

20:16.672 --> 20:19.908
but I had already seen hundreds
of men killed in battle."

20:19.976 --> 20:22.077
Shot in the head.

20:22.144 --> 20:25.447
There's nothing we can do
for this poor soul.

20:25.514 --> 20:28.383
"Hundreds more
maimed irreparably.

20:28.451 --> 20:30.552
Can you hear me, son?
His artery is shredded--

20:30.619 --> 20:33.988
- "none of that prepared me
for meeting Jacob Dunham."

20:43.866 --> 20:45.500
- Hey, Cameron.
- Hey, Doc.

20:45.568 --> 20:47.669
Um, are you busy?
'Cause I can come back.

20:47.737 --> 20:49.437
- No, I'm--I'm--
- You know what?

20:49.505 --> 20:51.406
Don't worry. I'll come back.
No, no, of course not.

20:51.473 --> 20:53.674
Come on in.

20:55.911 --> 20:58.946
Wow.
Did you, uh, rob a library?

20:59.014 --> 21:00.648
Looks that way,
doesn't it?

21:00.716 --> 21:02.383
They're Civil War documents.

21:02.451 --> 21:05.453
Right now I'm reading
a physician's war diary.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.154
It's pretty fascinating.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.356
Have a look.

21:08.424 --> 21:12.127
"The journal
of Dr. Zachary Harrison."

21:12.194 --> 21:13.628
Any headaches?

21:13.696 --> 21:15.763
None this week.

21:15.831 --> 21:17.264
You haven't mentioned my name

21:17.332 --> 21:19.567
in any of those records,
have you?

21:19.634 --> 21:22.370
My descriptions
remain anonymous, as we agreed.

21:22.438 --> 21:24.439
You weren't
quite this distrustful

21:24.507 --> 21:25.940
before you survived
that bullet two years ago.

21:29.645 --> 21:32.480
Shall we?

21:57.405 --> 22:00.974
It's even faster now.

22:01.041 --> 22:04.077
You're getting stronger.

22:04.144 --> 22:08.014
And with no scarring--
simply amazing.

22:08.082 --> 22:10.650
How'd he pull off
that little trick?

22:10.718 --> 22:15.089
By using his Alpha ability.

22:15.157 --> 22:17.592
I think Dunham
is Stanton Parish.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.564
Parish?

22:22.632 --> 22:24.132
You really believe
this guy's been kicking around

22:24.200 --> 22:26.968
for two centuries?
Well, it is hard to fathom.

22:27.036 --> 22:29.004
I-I think this incident
is the first time

22:29.071 --> 22:30.439
he realized
what he's capable of.

22:30.506 --> 22:32.808
How exactly does this
help us catch him now?

22:32.876 --> 22:34.643
Well, learning
about his formative years

22:34.710 --> 22:36.411
might help us understand
what drives the man.

22:36.479 --> 22:39.348
Hmm.

22:39.416 --> 22:41.350
As the old saying goes,

22:41.418 --> 22:44.053
<i>"zhi bi zhi ji</i>
<i>bai zhan bu Dai."</i>

22:44.120 --> 22:46.556
Yeah, that old Chestnut.

22:46.623 --> 22:47.924
That's Sun Tzu.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.625
"Know your enemy
like yourself,

22:49.693 --> 22:53.562
and you may win 100 battles."

22:53.630 --> 22:56.765
So is there something you want
to talk about, Cameron?

23:01.938 --> 23:05.340
You know how much
I respect you, Doc,

23:05.407 --> 23:07.408
and I just--
I wanted to let you know

23:07.476 --> 23:10.678
that, um,
I'm in a relationship--

23:10.746 --> 23:11.846
Dani.

23:11.914 --> 23:14.716
I know.

23:14.784 --> 23:17.686
Well, Nina took it upon herself
to make sure I knew.

23:17.754 --> 23:20.856
- Well, isn't that just perfect?
- Well, I sort of knew already.

23:20.924 --> 23:24.360
I mean, it's--it's obvious,
seeing you two together.

23:24.428 --> 23:27.330
So, as long as you make
my daughter happy,

23:27.398 --> 23:29.032
you can keep your job here.

23:43.047 --> 23:46.150
♪ I haven't been myself ♪

23:46.217 --> 23:49.052
♪ of late ♪

23:49.120 --> 23:54.957
♪ I haven't slept
for several days ♪

23:55.025 --> 23:59.995
♪ you know you drive me
up the wall... ♪

24:01.798 --> 24:03.632
Yeah?

24:03.700 --> 24:05.200
Jeannie?

24:05.268 --> 24:07.769
Jeannie, what are you
doing here? I--

24:07.837 --> 24:09.838
I'm--I mean,
is everything okay?

24:11.374 --> 24:13.008
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

24:13.076 --> 24:15.578
I've never felt better,
actually,

24:15.645 --> 24:17.880
and without the pills.

24:17.948 --> 24:20.183
What you got there?
It smells good.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.584
I brought you
some herb-crusted chicken

24:21.652 --> 24:23.086
and scalloped potatoes.

24:23.153 --> 24:24.187
You hungry?

24:24.255 --> 24:27.390
Am I hungry?
You want to know...

24:27.458 --> 24:28.525
If I'm hungry.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.995
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

24:31.062 --> 24:31.962
What

24:32.030 --> 24:33.397
Shh.

24:33.465 --> 24:34.532
- Isn't it--
- What? What? What?

24:34.599 --> 24:36.501
- Bill! What are you doing?
- What?

24:36.569 --> 24:37.969
What are you--oh!

24:40.006 --> 24:42.241
Gary, you can't live
in your office.

24:42.308 --> 24:44.042
You've gotta be practical.

24:44.110 --> 24:45.444
I am being practical.

24:45.511 --> 24:47.245
You won't have to hear me
scream every day.

24:47.313 --> 24:48.580
But you need to be safe.

24:48.648 --> 24:50.482
Yeah, it is safe.
It's safer.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.884
I won't have to drive
to work anymore,

24:52.952 --> 24:55.254
'cause people die
in car crashes all the time.

24:55.321 --> 24:59.257
And Dr. Rosen--
he forgets to signal a lot.

24:59.325 --> 25:01.459
And anyway, the building
has security, so there--

25:01.527 --> 25:04.829
it's more secure
than this place.

25:04.897 --> 25:08.299
Don't you tell me
you support him in this.

25:08.366 --> 25:10.334
I think we both
need to support Gary

25:10.402 --> 25:12.669
in whatever steps
he needs to take

25:12.737 --> 25:16.406
towards his independence.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.208
But this is too big a step.

25:23.815 --> 25:26.283
For him or for you?

25:35.626 --> 25:38.862
Yeah, let me get a turkey dog
with everything.

25:38.929 --> 25:39.996
Coming up.
And for you?

25:40.064 --> 25:41.431
What do you want?

25:41.499 --> 25:43.599
Uh, what do
they taste like?

25:43.667 --> 25:45.602
They taste like hot dogs.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.571
What, you've never had
a hot dog before?

25:47.638 --> 25:49.406
Must have, right?

25:49.473 --> 25:51.341
Um, yeah, I'll just have
the same thing.

25:51.409 --> 25:52.576
All right,
give me two, please.

25:52.644 --> 25:55.012
Thanks.
Thanks.

25:55.079 --> 25:57.181
- So you coming tonight?
- Hell, yeah.

25:57.248 --> 25:59.450
There's gonna be
a boatload of people there

25:59.518 --> 26:00.885
with deep pockets,

26:00.953 --> 26:03.421
so you got to crush everyone
so we can rake it.

26:03.489 --> 26:07.158
Yeah, you need
some of this here.

26:07.226 --> 26:09.027
Some peppers and...

26:09.095 --> 26:12.598
so what about, uh, Bazevich?
Think he'll be there?

26:12.665 --> 26:15.934
You have, like, a man-crush
on him or something?

26:16.002 --> 26:17.169
How should I know
if he's coming?

26:17.237 --> 26:18.604
What do you mean
how should you know?

26:18.672 --> 26:20.573
I thought you knew everything
about these fights.

26:20.641 --> 26:22.141
How did you get involved
with them anyway?

26:22.209 --> 26:24.577
Just kind of
found myself there.

26:24.645 --> 26:27.346
These are amazing.
This is good.

26:27.414 --> 26:28.414
- You like that?
- Yeah.

26:28.482 --> 26:30.182
That's good stuff.

26:30.250 --> 26:34.187
What do you mean
you just found yourself there?

26:34.255 --> 26:38.791
I. I have this thing
where I can't remember

26:38.859 --> 26:43.296
anything that happened, like,
more than a month ago.

26:43.364 --> 26:44.664
Like, a month from now,

26:44.732 --> 26:49.203
I won't remember this
or you or the hot dog.

26:49.271 --> 26:51.372
- You serious?
- Mm-hmm.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.975
My brain's wired to,
like, make room

26:54.043 --> 26:55.910
for all the new crap
I learn, you know?

26:55.978 --> 26:58.613
Yeah, but what about
your family, your home?

26:58.681 --> 27:01.216
Home's the fights for now.

27:01.284 --> 27:04.720
You got to be careful.
That's a rough crowd.

27:04.787 --> 27:07.489
Don't get all "Papa bear"
on me, okay?

27:07.557 --> 27:11.059
I've been taking care
of myself for...

27:11.127 --> 27:13.729
Well, I can't remember,
but it--it's been a long time.

27:13.796 --> 27:15.997
It's got to be lonely,
though.

27:21.938 --> 27:23.838
It's stupid, though.

27:23.906 --> 27:25.807
I don't know
why libraries do this.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.777
Dr. Rosen, it's just
a big waste of space.

27:28.845 --> 27:31.246
They could fit everything
in here just on one microchip.

27:31.314 --> 27:32.648
Inside voice, please, Gary.

27:32.715 --> 27:34.216
What?

27:34.284 --> 27:35.851
Inside voice, please.

27:35.919 --> 27:40.088
My inside voice
is too quiet.

27:40.156 --> 27:44.559
Well, split the difference,
then, huh?

27:44.627 --> 27:47.162
Oh, we are fortunate
this university

27:47.230 --> 27:50.231
preserved its newspapers.

28:02.811 --> 28:06.446
Jacob.
This is a surprise.

28:06.514 --> 28:10.583
You're making
a presentation tonight.

28:10.651 --> 28:13.453
Your abilities
are extraordinary.

28:15.189 --> 28:18.091
Cancel your presentation,
Zac.

28:18.159 --> 28:20.894
Promise to never speak
of what I can do.

28:20.961 --> 28:22.863
I can't, Jacob.

28:22.930 --> 28:25.632
It's too important
to keep to ourselves.

28:42.651 --> 28:45.519
This crowd is hot tonight.

28:45.587 --> 28:47.354
Well, Rocky, try and remember
why we're here.

28:47.422 --> 28:48.689
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:48.757 --> 28:50.324
You see Kat anywhere?

28:50.392 --> 28:51.859
Don't worry about that kid.
She can take care of herself.

28:51.927 --> 28:53.227
No, look, she can't take care
of herself.

28:53.295 --> 28:55.229
She forgets things.
She could be lost or confused.

28:55.297 --> 28:57.298
I think she's gonna be okay.
Just stay focused.

28:57.366 --> 28:58.499
All right, all right,
all right.

28:58.567 --> 28:59.734
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

28:59.801 --> 29:01.703
Who is gonna start the show?

29:01.770 --> 29:03.071
I will.

29:03.138 --> 29:05.573
No, no, no, no, no, man.
We need a real fighter.

29:05.641 --> 29:08.176
Bring it on.

29:08.244 --> 29:10.245
All right, all right,
we got some fresh meat.

29:10.312 --> 29:12.514
Now, who is gonna
be the challenger?

29:12.582 --> 29:14.449
Rubberman!

29:20.590 --> 29:22.825
I'm gonna remember
to send you some flowers.

29:22.893 --> 29:24.994
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
you know what time it is.

29:25.062 --> 29:26.762
Time to place your bets!

29:35.607 --> 29:38.242
There's nothing to control.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.511
You don't have
to reach for it,

29:40.579 --> 29:42.914
'cause it's part of you.

29:42.981 --> 29:45.349
When you want it,
it'll be there.

30:04.869 --> 30:07.637
Unit one still clear.

30:07.705 --> 30:11.174
So your dad and both sisters
are in the military.

30:11.242 --> 30:12.375
Your brother's a cop.

30:12.443 --> 30:13.943
You must have felt
a lot of pressure

30:14.011 --> 30:17.546
to make certain choices
about your life, huh?

30:17.614 --> 30:20.882
Sounds like you can relate.

30:20.950 --> 30:22.852
I smell something.

30:22.919 --> 30:23.953
Seriously?
I mean, I--

30:24.020 --> 30:24.920
No.

30:28.625 --> 30:29.825
That S.U.V.

30:29.893 --> 30:31.927
He's not in there now,
but Bazevich--

30:31.995 --> 30:33.429
he was definitely in there.

30:33.497 --> 30:35.631
All right, all right,
all right.

30:35.699 --> 30:37.600
Who's next?

30:39.169 --> 30:41.237
I am.

30:43.407 --> 30:45.041
Nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah.

30:45.109 --> 30:47.043
Surprise.

30:48.427 --> 30:49.526
You trying to play me, Kat?

30:49.594 --> 30:51.061
I never said
I wasn't a fighter.

30:51.129 --> 30:53.402
There is gonna be
some action tonight!

30:53.502 --> 30:54.836
Place your bets!
Right now!

30:54.903 --> 30:56.504
Kat, this isn't
a good idea.

30:56.571 --> 31:00.107
Harken,
this isn't personal.

31:00.175 --> 31:01.475
All right, all right.
What you waiting for?

31:05.780 --> 31:09.115
In battle, a warrior
who remains calm

31:09.183 --> 31:11.117
and remembers their training

31:11.185 --> 31:15.054
will always vanquish a foe
who does not.

31:18.826 --> 31:21.628
Shift your opponent's weight
to one leg

31:21.696 --> 31:23.663
and attack
the weighted knee.

31:28.703 --> 31:30.070
If you lack size,

31:30.138 --> 31:32.640
compensate with speed
and precision.

31:40.482 --> 31:43.484
The brain
is the most sensitive organ

31:43.552 --> 31:45.720
in the human body.

31:53.130 --> 31:54.997
Aah!

32:01.973 --> 32:05.376
Hey.
Hey, you all right?

32:05.443 --> 32:06.677
Is he okay?

32:06.745 --> 32:08.545
He's awesome.
Yeah, thanks.

32:08.613 --> 32:09.847
Hey, Harken.

32:09.915 --> 32:11.248
Harken.

32:11.316 --> 32:12.249
Come on.

32:12.317 --> 32:13.584
Not bad.

32:13.652 --> 32:17.787
Some people want to talk
to you about a job.

32:17.855 --> 32:20.256
- What kind of a job?
- Well, I don't know.

32:20.324 --> 32:23.126
They didn't say,
but I know they pay big.

32:23.193 --> 32:26.862
Hear 'em out.
Let 'em buy you a drink.

32:26.930 --> 32:30.099
Okay.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.634
You all right?

32:36.973 --> 32:39.074
Oh, that's that girl Kat
from the other night.

32:43.413 --> 32:45.481
Bill! Hicks!
Come on!

32:49.753 --> 32:50.720
What happened?

32:50.788 --> 32:52.054
You okay?

32:52.122 --> 32:53.322
Ask him who did it.

32:53.390 --> 32:54.991
Hicks, I will kill you.

32:55.059 --> 32:57.027
Hey, listen,
we got a lead on Bazevich.

32:57.094 --> 32:58.495
He was in that car.

32:58.562 --> 32:59.829
Oh, and your friend Kat
just got in there.

32:59.897 --> 33:01.297
All right, let's go.
Come on.

33:08.872 --> 33:12.141
That's their S.U.V.

33:12.209 --> 33:14.644
What the hell is this place?

33:14.712 --> 33:17.448
Okay, Bazevich is inside.

33:17.515 --> 33:19.716
You can smell him?

33:19.784 --> 33:21.385
Believe me,
he's unforgettable.

33:21.453 --> 33:22.854
Rachel,
what's going on in there?

33:22.921 --> 33:26.091
There's, uh...

33:26.158 --> 33:27.692
There's multiple heartbeats.

33:27.760 --> 33:33.031
An EKG, respirators,
hospital machines?

33:33.099 --> 33:35.868
The place is wired
with sensor alarms.

33:35.935 --> 33:38.370
I hear weaponry...

33:38.438 --> 33:41.406
And heavy boots.

33:41.474 --> 33:43.508
Unit One to tactical,
send backup to our position.

33:43.576 --> 33:45.510
Wait.
It's that girl Kat.

33:45.578 --> 33:50.215
No! Let me go!

33:50.283 --> 33:52.918
Her voice is weak.
She's fading.

33:52.985 --> 33:56.555
A male voice now.
"Make sure she stays under."

33:56.623 --> 33:59.124
They want to prep her
right away.

33:59.192 --> 34:00.592
Prep her for what?

34:00.660 --> 34:03.062
- I can't wait.
- Harken, wait!

34:03.129 --> 34:05.998
Damn it!

34:11.638 --> 34:14.339
Kat!

34:14.407 --> 34:15.974
Kat!

34:16.042 --> 34:17.641
Kat!

34:26.252 --> 34:27.752
Harken!

34:51.043 --> 34:51.909
Kat!

34:58.784 --> 35:00.118
Kat!

35:04.557 --> 35:05.891
Hey!

35:05.959 --> 35:07.860
- Bazevich?
- What are you doing?

35:07.928 --> 35:10.162
Kat!
Wait-unh!

35:13.567 --> 35:16.334
Kat.

35:16.402 --> 35:17.702
Kat!
Harken...

35:17.770 --> 35:20.605
You're gonna be okay.

35:23.109 --> 35:24.776
Harken!

35:29.115 --> 35:31.157
Unh!

35:36.254 --> 35:38.823
Good job.

35:38.890 --> 35:41.192
Is she okay?

35:41.259 --> 35:43.694
Kat...

35:43.762 --> 35:45.263
You okay?

35:45.330 --> 35:48.966
I beat you.

35:49.034 --> 35:50.868
Yeah, you beat me.

35:50.935 --> 35:53.303
We'll need three ambulances

35:53.371 --> 35:54.704
and transport for prisoners
to Binghamton.

35:54.772 --> 35:58.008
104, gotcha.

35:58.076 --> 36:01.111
- So that's Bazevich.
- Hmm.

36:01.179 --> 36:02.446
The guy we've been chasing
the last two days

36:02.514 --> 36:04.414
is a dead man.

36:09.553 --> 36:12.355
Hey, turns out Bazevich
was a prisoner here too.

36:12.423 --> 36:15.359
Poetic justice
for killing Duffy, I guess.

36:15.427 --> 36:16.660
Can you believe it?

36:16.728 --> 36:18.296
Experimenting on Alphas.

36:18.363 --> 36:20.164
More like treating us
like animals.

36:20.232 --> 36:22.400
I could have gotten
out of there myself, you know.

36:22.468 --> 36:23.835
You know what?

36:23.903 --> 36:25.570
You can just say,
"Thank you so much,

36:25.638 --> 36:27.940
Bill Harken,
for rescuing me."

36:28.008 --> 36:30.142
I kicked your ass
once tonight.

36:30.210 --> 36:31.677
Do you want to go again?

36:31.745 --> 36:33.679
Easy does it, young lady.

36:33.747 --> 36:35.414
You're going to have to take it
easy for a while.

36:35.481 --> 36:36.849
You've been through quite
an ordeal.

36:36.916 --> 36:39.485
Just give me a couple weeks.
I won't remember.

36:39.552 --> 36:42.187
Hmm.

36:42.255 --> 36:44.356
I want to have a look
at you, too, later.

36:44.424 --> 36:46.425
No, no.
I'm--I'm fine. I'm fine.

36:46.492 --> 36:50.328
Look, I got to use my ability
and feel no downside, so...

36:50.396 --> 36:52.931
- No downside?
- No downside at all.

36:52.999 --> 36:55.734
Hey, Dr. Rosen,
who are you guys anyway?

36:55.801 --> 36:58.537
So Harken was undercover, right?
I wasn't undercover.

36:58.604 --> 36:59.872
You were
definitely undercover.

36:59.939 --> 37:02.508
And then he--he barged in
with those guys.

37:02.576 --> 37:03.776
We're consultants.

37:03.844 --> 37:05.144
We work with the government
now and then

37:05.212 --> 37:07.080
in situations
not unlike this one.

37:07.148 --> 37:08.882
You're Alpha Secret Agents,
right?

37:08.950 --> 37:10.350
- You're gonna be fine.
- You're Alpha secret agents.

37:10.418 --> 37:11.651
Just take it easy.

37:11.719 --> 37:14.487
- I to--I'm totally right.
- No, no.

37:14.555 --> 37:16.890
I'm right, right?

37:16.957 --> 37:18.892
You want me on your team.
I'm awesome.

37:31.738 --> 37:33.205
It's the perfect soap.

37:33.273 --> 37:35.540
It'll blend really well
with your natural scent,

37:35.608 --> 37:37.042
which, by the way, is--

37:37.109 --> 37:40.612
is really good
on its own anyway, so...

37:40.679 --> 37:41.813
there.

37:41.881 --> 37:45.217
Thanks.
Um, I'll try it.

37:45.284 --> 37:48.219
I was--I was,
uh, in the village,

37:48.287 --> 37:50.922
and I found it at this shop
next to my favorite restaurant,

37:50.990 --> 37:54.324
which is Italian.

37:54.392 --> 37:55.759
Oh.

38:04.602 --> 38:06.469
Do you like Italian?

38:09.539 --> 38:11.207
Um...

38:11.274 --> 38:14.310
Rachel, if--if we're going
to be working together--

38:14.377 --> 38:15.711
Right.

38:15.779 --> 38:19.415
Forget I mentioned it.

38:40.572 --> 38:42.573
What can I get you?

38:42.641 --> 38:45.176
Earl Grey tea, please.

38:45.244 --> 38:49.014
Okay.

38:49.082 --> 38:50.215
Hello, Lee.

38:50.283 --> 38:52.851
May I join you?

38:54.861 --> 38:57.529
You made it
very easy for me, Stanton.

38:57.995 --> 39:00.530
Or do you prefer Major Dunham?

39:00.598 --> 39:03.066
I prefer Stanton.

39:03.134 --> 39:06.203
Well, thank you for providing
Dr. Harrison's research.

39:06.270 --> 39:08.739
So you'd know how I began.

39:08.806 --> 39:11.241
Yes.
By murdering a friend.

39:13.311 --> 39:17.648
Dr. Harrison
wanted to use me.

39:17.716 --> 39:21.318
So you scarified
an innocent man.

39:21.385 --> 39:24.321
Have you ever sacrificed
an innocent man?

39:24.389 --> 39:26.022
Not intentionally.

39:26.090 --> 39:29.126
Every man must control
his own destiny.

39:31.763 --> 39:34.564
I reenlisted
after the doctor's death.

39:34.632 --> 39:36.766
I helped saved the Union.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.368
Hmm.

39:38.436 --> 39:39.636
So you're what--

39:39.704 --> 39:42.506
looking for the thanks
of a grateful nation?

39:42.574 --> 39:44.341
No.

39:44.409 --> 39:49.013
Just some understanding
of my unique perspective.

39:49.081 --> 39:52.050
I was shot again
at Cold Harbor

39:52.118 --> 39:54.186
and again at San Juan Hill,

39:54.253 --> 39:57.389
fought at Verdun,
in the streets of Berlin.

39:57.457 --> 39:59.024
Oh, a very impressive resume.

39:59.092 --> 40:00.993
Thank you.

40:02.930 --> 40:07.466
Every change brings bloodshed.

40:07.534 --> 40:10.403
We can stop that.

40:10.470 --> 40:12.705
And yet you say
a war is coming.

40:12.773 --> 40:15.175
Hmm.

40:15.243 --> 40:17.444
Because...

40:20.915 --> 40:24.984
ordinary men react
with fear and violence

40:25.052 --> 40:27.186
to anything
that's new and different.

40:30.823 --> 40:32.357
You know,
one of my favorite subjects

40:32.425 --> 40:34.925
in medical school
was cellular research...

40:34.993 --> 40:36.260
Mmhmm.

40:36.328 --> 40:39.163
Examining the constituent
parts of things,

40:39.230 --> 40:42.533
trying to figure out
how it all...

40:42.601 --> 40:44.568
works together.

40:44.636 --> 40:46.804
It was very tedious,
but, um...

40:46.872 --> 40:50.975
It was exciting,
because eventually...

40:51.043 --> 40:54.145
I could see the whole picture.

40:57.683 --> 41:00.552
Try the tuna melt next time.

41:00.620 --> 41:03.054
It's excellent.

41:19.239 --> 41:21.540
No, Mom.
Don't do that.

41:21.608 --> 41:23.376
That's how I like it.

41:23.443 --> 41:25.311
Yeah, but that's the way
you keep it at home.

41:25.378 --> 41:28.047
No, this is home.
It's how I like it here.

41:28.115 --> 41:31.417
Right.

41:36.023 --> 41:37.223
Good night, Gary.

41:37.291 --> 41:41.862
Yeah, good night.

41:43.498 --> 41:45.265
Uh, Mom.

41:45.333 --> 41:46.467
Where'd you go?

41:46.534 --> 41:49.036
I'm right here.

41:51.239 --> 41:55.143
I'll call you at 8:00
after I scream,

41:55.210 --> 41:56.945
but before
I've had my breakfast.

41:59.115 --> 42:00.582
I'll answer.

42:00.650 --> 42:04.286
Yeah, okay.

42:13.953 --> 42:17.953
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

42:22.203 --> 42:24.104
Well, look who's back.

42:24.172 --> 42:25.973
Here to watch?

42:26.041 --> 42:29.143
Hell, no.
I'm here to fight.
