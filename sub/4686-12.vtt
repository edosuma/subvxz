<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>
<i>I know this is a sad day</i>

00:04.082 --> 00:05.582
<i>for McKinley</i>
<i>and that we've come back</i>

00:05.617 --> 00:07.785
<i>to reflect on everything</i>
<i>the glee club has meant to us.</i>

00:07.819 --> 00:10.754
MERCEDES: <i>But still, I figured they'd
at least put up a poster saying</i>

00:10.789 --> 00:12.389
<i>"Welcome back, Mercedes."</i>

00:12.424 --> 00:14.258
RACHEL:
<i>I mean, look, no confetti.</i>

00:14.292 --> 00:16.694
MERCEDES: <i>No red carpet
even though I called.</i>

00:16.728 --> 00:18.128
<i>I'm the biggest Broadway Star I'm
the biggest recording artist</i>

00:18.163 --> 00:19.396
BOTH:
<i>this school's ever produced!</i>

00:19.431 --> 00:20.798
- <i>What the hell?!</i>
- <i>What happened?!</i>

00:20.832 --> 00:22.266
- I would be so excited.
- I'm excited.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.467
- Are you nervous?
- I mean, like, a little.

00:23.501 --> 00:24.468
Of course she is!

00:24.502 --> 00:25.736
- It's your Broadway debut!
- I know!

00:25.770 --> 00:28.005
(all clamoring) UNIQUE: Oh, my God.
I can't wait

00:28.039 --> 00:29.640
for that album to drop.
Thank you.

00:29.674 --> 00:31.408
RACHEL: <i>I mean, come on. She
wrote a couple of songs.</i>

00:31.443 --> 00:32.476
<i>Big whoop.</i>

00:32.509 --> 00:33.844
MERCEDES:
<i>So what? She got cast</i>

00:33.878 --> 00:35.579
<i>in a play</i>
<i>as an annoying Jewish girl.</i>

00:35.613 --> 00:36.680
<i>What a surprise.</i>

00:36.715 --> 00:38.182
RACHEL:
<i>There's only one way</i>

00:38.216 --> 00:40.184

center in the Rachel chair.</i>

00:46.191 --> 00:47.491
Greet each other.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.593
Hello, Rachel.

00:49.627 --> 00:51.261
I am so happy to hear

00:51.296 --> 00:53.397
about all of your success.

00:53.431 --> 00:54.932
Oh, thank you so much, Mercedes.

00:54.966 --> 00:56.233
And you are looking well.

00:56.267 --> 00:57.434
Thank you.

00:57.469 --> 00:59.003
Now, if you'll excuse me,

00:59.037 --> 01:01.238
I'll make my way
to the back of the bus.

01:01.272 --> 01:03.540

01:03.575 --> 01:06.110
Hey, can I get Finn's plaque
when we clear this place out?

01:06.144 --> 01:07.611
No, the plaque stays here.

01:07.645 --> 01:09.046
Lillian and Finn

01:09.080 --> 01:11.315
belong here at McKinley.

01:14.185 --> 01:16.987
It means so much to me

01:17.022 --> 01:19.423
that so many of you came
back on such short notice

01:19.457 --> 01:22.893
to celebrate the
past few years.

01:22.927 --> 01:24.962
To sit in this room
one last time

01:24.996 --> 01:26.563
and sing.

01:26.598 --> 01:28.766
Your assignment is to sing

01:28.800 --> 01:30.100
one of the songs
we sang in here,

01:30.135 --> 01:32.436
but reinvented in some way.

01:32.470 --> 01:34.705
Way back in the old days
when I started the glee club,

01:34.739 --> 01:36.580
I would give an assignment,
and then I would...

01:36.608 --> 01:37.741
I would give
a little demonstration

01:37.776 --> 01:39.209
of what I was looking for.

01:39.244 --> 01:40.711
ALL:
Yeah!

01:40.745 --> 01:41.945
See, you all cheer now,

01:41.980 --> 01:43.714
but just wait
till he starts rapping.

01:43.748 --> 01:45.282
Okay, no hip-hop today, Santana.

01:45.316 --> 01:48.452
However, I have asked a very
special person to come join me.

01:48.486 --> 01:50.054
And it seemed appropriate
since her contributions

01:50.088 --> 01:51.422
helped save the glee club,

01:51.456 --> 01:54.091
or at least the auditorium
way back when.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.993
Please welcome, all the
way from Broadway,

01:56.027 --> 01:57.528
Miss April Rhodes!

01:57.562 --> 01:58.829
Hey, y'all!

01:58.863 --> 02:00.264
(all cheering, whooping)

02:00.298 --> 02:01.965
(laughs)

02:02.000 --> 02:03.667
You know, she once taught
me how to shoplift meat

02:03.701 --> 02:05.269
- in my vagina.
- Ew.

02:05.303 --> 02:06.970
Right?

02:10.008 --> 02:11.875
So, Mr. Moneybags says
to me, he says,

02:11.910 --> 02:14.244
"April Rhodes,
you sing like an angel

02:14.279 --> 02:15.879
"and make love like a tiger.

02:15.914 --> 02:17.915
"But the old ball and chain's
got your number.

02:17.949 --> 02:20.317
So I'm afraid
I gots to set you loose."

02:20.351 --> 02:23.187
So, you know what he did?

02:23.221 --> 02:25.122
He bought me an island!

02:25.156 --> 02:26.757
(laughs) That's right.

02:26.791 --> 02:28.425
I own my own island

02:28.460 --> 02:31.361
in the Caribbean called
Santa Abrilrodeo.

02:31.396 --> 02:34.098
It's not war-torn
or filled with landslides

02:34.132 --> 02:35.933
or got destitute locals in it.

02:35.967 --> 02:38.368
Just me
and my manservant Kadeem.

02:38.403 --> 02:40.704
With long, sensuous nights

02:40.738 --> 02:42.539
full of home-brewed poi

02:42.574 --> 02:43.974
and intimate massage...

02:44.008 --> 02:46.143
Okay, thank you, April,
for that...

02:46.177 --> 02:48.445
wonderful lesson
in female empowerment.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.446
Amen!

02:49.481 --> 02:51.648
ARTIE:
Amen, but...

02:51.683 --> 02:53.750
why are we all holding
these plastic champagne flutes?

02:53.785 --> 02:56.687
'Cause we are about to pop
the cork with some bubbly.

02:56.721 --> 02:59.790
But don't worry,
this Spumante is virgin.

02:59.824 --> 03:01.024
Probably like you will be

03:01.059 --> 03:03.227
for a long time.
(laughs)

03:03.261 --> 03:04.328
Anyways...

03:04.362 --> 03:06.296
(grunts) Will and I want you

03:06.331 --> 03:07.631
to raise your glass

03:07.665 --> 03:10.067
to celebrate the
glee club by singing

03:10.101 --> 03:12.569
hands down the best song
New Directions! ever did.

03:12.604 --> 03:14.004
Wait a second, the New
Directions! never sang

03:14.038 --> 03:15.806
"Raise Your Glass."
The Warblers did that.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.274
I was wondering
why it didn't annoy me

03:17.308 --> 03:18.809
every time I heard it
in my head.

03:18.843 --> 03:21.078
I always have had
a soft spot in my heart

03:21.112 --> 03:23.046
for you prep school boys.

03:23.081 --> 03:24.548

Hey, Puck.

06:10.081 --> 06:12.282
Hey.

06:12.317 --> 06:15.218
So, uh, have you noticed
how hot I look in my uniform?

06:15.253 --> 06:16.820
It does look a little bit itchy.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.021
Are you serious or...?

06:18.056 --> 06:19.189
I'm just kidding.

06:19.223 --> 06:20.490
You look really handsome.

06:20.525 --> 06:22.893
It's not just
the uniform, either.

06:22.927 --> 06:25.595
You've got this newfound
confidence about you.

06:25.630 --> 06:27.364
So, um,

06:27.398 --> 06:29.679
do you know what song you're
gonna sing for the glee club?

06:29.701 --> 06:30.667
I'm not sure.

06:30.702 --> 06:32.502
Maybe we could go to Breadstix.

06:32.537 --> 06:34.071
Mull some potentials.

Hi.

06:38.343 --> 06:40.444
(groans) I got bored
sitting at the hotel.

06:40.478 --> 06:41.645
Who's this?

06:41.679 --> 06:43.747
Puck, this is my boyfriend.

06:43.781 --> 06:45.382
Biff Macintosh.

06:45.416 --> 06:46.650
Like the Apple?

06:46.684 --> 06:47.984
Yeah, exactly like it.

06:48.019 --> 06:49.986
My family planted the first
Macintosh apple orchard

06:50.021 --> 06:51.154
in Pennsylvania.

06:51.189 --> 06:53.090
So, every time you have
one of our apples,

06:53.124 --> 06:54.524
we get a nickel.

This is my very old,

Noah Puckerman.

07:00.298 --> 07:03.266
Puck, Puckerman.
Is that Jewish?

07:03.301 --> 07:04.368
She never told you about me?

07:04.402 --> 07:05.869
How long you been going out?

07:05.903 --> 07:07.270
About three months.
Well, you know,

07:07.305 --> 07:09.225
Quinn doesn't really like
to talk about her past,

07:09.240 --> 07:10.941
which is why I insisted
on coming back

07:10.975 --> 07:12.409
too see it for
myself, as boring

07:12.443 --> 07:13.564
as you said it might be.
Mmm.

07:13.578 --> 07:14.678
I said, "If you want
to meet Mother,

07:14.712 --> 07:16.713
I have to really get
to know you first."

07:16.748 --> 07:18.915
Wait, you call your mother
"Mother"?

07:18.950 --> 07:20.550
I need to show Biff
the auditorium.

07:20.585 --> 07:22.452
Thank you so much.

07:22.487 --> 07:23.720
It's been great
talking to you, Puck.

07:23.755 --> 07:25.355
It was good to meet you.
Nice uniform.

07:25.390 --> 07:27.057
Looks a little itchy, though.

07:28.259 --> 07:30.594

07:30.628 --> 07:34.331
Hey. I've been looking
for you everywhere.

07:34.365 --> 07:36.333

What are you doing?

07:36.367 --> 07:39.102
I'm trying to prove
the Reimann hypothesis.

07:39.137 --> 07:40.237
Who's forcing you to do this?

07:40.271 --> 07:41.605
My colleagues at M.I.T.

07:41.639 --> 07:44.274
They said I had the most
gifted mind in a generation.

where I wasn't a
mathematical genius

08:07.198 --> 08:09.232
and all I wanted to do
was to scissor you

08:09.267 --> 08:11.134
and to talk to my cat.
Well,

what do you say you and I

08:13.037 --> 08:15.972

That is what I'm

10:24.602 --> 10:26.102
talking about, kiddos.

10:26.137 --> 10:28.471
What did you think,
Mr. Preppy McDimplebutt?

10:28.506 --> 10:30.574
Oh, I thought it was, um,

10:30.608 --> 10:32.442
very energetic.

10:32.476 --> 10:34.878
Dude, you were texting
the whole time.

10:34.912 --> 10:36.079
Yeah, well, he's very busy.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.981
He's, um, president of a...
of a secret society

10:38.015 --> 10:39.950
and also captain
of the water polo team.

10:39.984 --> 10:42.586
(school bell rings)

10:43.955 --> 10:44.955
You were great.

10:44.989 --> 10:47.057
Oh.
(laughs)

10:47.091 --> 10:48.458
Well, you were amazing as usual.

10:48.492 --> 10:49.693
No, I wasn't.

10:49.727 --> 10:51.161
During the bridge,
I was out of sync

10:51.195 --> 10:52.295
one 16th of a seventh step.

10:52.330 --> 10:53.630
What are you talking about?

10:53.664 --> 10:54.998
You're the most amazing dancer
I've ever met.

10:55.032 --> 10:56.700
No, I need to focus
on what I'm good at.

10:56.734 --> 10:57.934
Quantitative algorithms.

because, as it turns out,
I'm a genius.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.088
Tonight's guests
are two of McKinley's

11:18.122 --> 11:20.523
most famous
nonmathematical geniuses,

11:20.558 --> 11:23.293
Mercedes Jones
and Rachel Berry.

11:23.327 --> 11:25.428
Question, Rachel:
Yes.

11:25.463 --> 11:26.496
You're currently rehearsing for

11:26.530 --> 11:27.797
the lead role
in a Broadway musical.

11:27.832 --> 11:29.699
You're also working full-time

11:29.734 --> 11:31.635
as a singing waitress at a diner

11:31.669 --> 11:34.137
and enrolled full-time
as a student at NYADA.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.472
That's correct.

11:35.506 --> 11:36.840
Would you agree that it's

11:36.874 --> 11:39.009
slightly irresponsible
for you to leave New York

11:39.043 --> 11:40.877
for an entire week
for no other reason

11:40.911 --> 11:42.178
than the glee club's
been canceled?

11:42.213 --> 11:43.513
Uh, no, I-I just...

11:43.547 --> 11:45.348
When are the lies going to stop?

11:45.383 --> 11:46.783
You don't even live in New York.

11:46.817 --> 11:48.551
I'm not even sure
you've been to New York.

11:48.586 --> 11:49.819
Brittany, we went
to New York together.

11:49.854 --> 11:51.054
Don't change the subject.

11:51.088 --> 11:53.123
Are your cats making out?

11:53.157 --> 11:54.858
(meowing, slurping)

11:54.892 --> 11:56.393
Yes, they are.

11:56.427 --> 11:59.396
Mercedes, how would you
respond to the rumors

11:59.430 --> 12:01.231
that you're a really
good dancer... Ha!

12:01.265 --> 12:03.199
But you hid the fact
the entire time

12:03.234 --> 12:04.868
you were in Glee Club
so Mr. Shue

12:04.902 --> 12:06.002
would allow you to, quote,

12:06.037 --> 12:07.704
"Park and Bark"?
No comment.

12:07.738 --> 12:09.706
Good. Last question.

12:09.740 --> 12:11.641
Do you know what song
you're going to sing

12:11.676 --> 12:13.143
for Mr. Shue's last assignment?

12:13.177 --> 12:14.511
MERCEDES and RACHEL:
Yes. "Defying Gravity."

12:14.545 --> 12:16.413
What?!
No, you can't sing that song.

12:16.447 --> 12:18.581
Kurt and I are singing it,
but we're switching parts

12:18.616 --> 12:21.251
so that I can belt out
the high note at the end.

12:21.285 --> 12:23.205
That's not reinventing a song.
You can't do that.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.421
You know what, Mercedes?

12:24.455 --> 12:26.156
Why don't we settle this
the old-fashioned way?

12:26.190 --> 12:27.290
A diva-off?

12:27.324 --> 12:29.659
Oh, hell to the yes.

12:29.694 --> 12:31.027
It's on.

12:33.856 --> 12:35.545
I've never really noticed
because I haven't spent

12:35.564 --> 12:36.728
that much time around them,

12:36.740 --> 12:38.999
but poor people are
generally less attractive

12:39.030 --> 12:41.299
than rich ones.
(chuckles)

12:41.333 --> 12:44.001
It means so much to me
that you came back here.

12:44.036 --> 12:46.704
You know, it makes us
feel so much more real.

12:46.739 --> 12:48.806
Yeah, well, we are very real.

12:48.841 --> 12:50.475
I love you, Quinn,
and I want to

12:50.509 --> 12:51.642
really get to know <i>you.</i>

12:51.677 --> 12:52.917
Well, what do you want to know?

12:52.945 --> 12:54.545
I can tell you so many things,

12:54.580 --> 12:56.114
like the time that I...

12:56.148 --> 12:57.448
Oh, no, not you.

12:57.483 --> 12:59.283
Hey, guys.
Come here. Yeah, you.

12:59.318 --> 13:00.985
(laughs) Come on.

13:02.554 --> 13:04.355
Hey, guys.

13:04.389 --> 13:07.125
Hi. Santana Lopez.

13:07.159 --> 13:09.260
Word on the street is
that you're old money.

13:09.294 --> 13:11.195
I'm a lesbian, but I'm
totally into that.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.530
(chuckles)

13:12.564 --> 13:13.765
Mike Chang, Asian dancer.

13:13.799 --> 13:15.566
And I'm Artie Abrams.
I may look like

13:15.601 --> 13:17.668
a dweeb in a wheelchair, but
my girlfriend's a cheerleader.

13:17.703 --> 13:19.637
So, what about Quinn?
How would you describe her

13:19.671 --> 13:20.638
in one sentence?

13:20.672 --> 13:21.973
She's constantly surprising you.

13:22.007 --> 13:24.475
Like, one year, she showed up
to school in the fall

13:24.510 --> 13:26.144
and decided she wanted
to be a skank.

13:26.178 --> 13:29.280
She dyed her hair pink, she
got a Ryan Seacrest tattoo,

13:29.314 --> 13:31.649
and then lit a purple
piano on fire.

13:31.683 --> 13:34.552
(laughs) BIFF: Hold
on one second.

13:34.586 --> 13:36.120
Piano?

13:36.155 --> 13:38.089
They're-They're messing
with you. Honey, I forgot

13:38.123 --> 13:40.358
my purse in the car,
and I'd really love

13:40.392 --> 13:41.826
(whispers): my lipstick
and some lady things.

13:41.860 --> 13:43.294
Oh, absolutely.
I'll go get it

13:43.328 --> 13:45.096
for you, sweetheart.
No worries.

13:47.933 --> 13:51.002
What the hell was that?

13:51.036 --> 13:53.304
I am trying to present myself
in a particular way.

13:53.338 --> 13:55.072
Biff's family is Philadelphia
Main Line society,

13:55.107 --> 13:57.742
and if I get in with that,
then my life is set.

13:57.776 --> 14:00.678
How do you cover up the tattoo, you know?
Like, what? Magic?

14:00.712 --> 14:04.348
I pay my roommate to apply
three coats of cover-up makeup

14:04.383 --> 14:06.017
to my lower back
before I see him.

14:06.051 --> 14:07.518
Does he know about us?
About Beth?

14:07.553 --> 14:09.854
I will tell him everything
when I'm ready.

14:11.657 --> 14:12.824
(school bell rings)

14:12.858 --> 14:14.625
APRIL: The agreement
clearly states

14:14.660 --> 14:16.460
that the provider of the funds,

14:16.495 --> 14:19.530
in this case, the April Rhodes
Charitable Foundation...

14:19.565 --> 14:23.434
independent LLC...
is, quote, "solely responsible

14:23.468 --> 14:25.169
"for the maintenance and
operation of this facility

14:25.204 --> 14:27.471
until such funds
are no longer provided."

14:27.506 --> 14:28.506
Which means?

14:28.540 --> 14:29.707
Which means, as long

14:29.741 --> 14:31.209
as I'm paying
for that auditorium,

14:31.243 --> 14:33.678
I gets to say
who performs there.

14:33.712 --> 14:35.546
If you'd like
to start paying for it...

14:35.581 --> 14:36.581
We can't do that.

14:36.615 --> 14:38.015
School doesn't have the money.

14:38.050 --> 14:40.117
Then it sounds to me
like the glee club is saved

14:40.152 --> 14:41.552
and that we're moving full-time
to the auditorium.

14:41.587 --> 14:44.021
I will have my team review this
and get back to you tomorrow.

14:44.056 --> 14:46.724
Uh, and let's hold off on
any official announcements

14:46.758 --> 14:48.860
until then. Agreed?

14:48.894 --> 14:50.027
(laughs)

14:50.062 --> 14:51.629
Let's get some box wine
to celebrate!

14:51.663 --> 14:52.797
Wow!

14:52.831 --> 14:55.099
(laughs)

14:55.133 --> 14:56.133
Becky.

14:57.186 --> 14:58.946
There's something fishy going on
around here.

14:58.971 --> 15:00.705
We're gonna get
to the bottom of it.

15:01.740 --> 15:03.007
All right, everybody,

15:03.041 --> 15:05.243
I wish I could say
that this week isn't about

15:05.277 --> 15:06.510
competing against each other,

15:06.545 --> 15:08.179
but time for
one last diva-off!

15:08.213 --> 15:09.614
And apparently, the only song

15:09.648 --> 15:12.049
we can sing in a diva-off
is "Defying Gravity."

15:12.084 --> 15:15.319
Wait. So we have to listen
to Kurt shred that note again?

15:15.354 --> 15:17.321
For the millionth time,
I did it on purpose.

15:17.356 --> 15:19.490
RACHEL: And after we're
done singing the song,

15:19.524 --> 15:20.892
there will be a secret ballot

15:20.926 --> 15:23.127
where you guys can finally
answer the age-old question:

15:23.161 --> 15:26.998
Who is the true star
of the glee club,

15:27.032 --> 15:28.733
me or Mercedes?

15:30.802 --> 15:33.404
<i>All I've ever wanted in here</i>
<i>was to feel chosen.</i>

15:33.438 --> 15:34.639
MERCEDES:

<i>all of the success</i>
<i>in the outside world</i>

15:36.408 --> 15:37.909

17:48.340 --> 17:50.007
Bravo!

17:50.042 --> 17:51.409
The song should be
on the Broadway.

17:51.443 --> 17:52.543
MERCEDES:
All right, let's stop

17:52.577 --> 17:53.811
playing around.
It's time to vote.

17:53.845 --> 17:55.646
Actually, let's just
take a beat and...

17:55.680 --> 17:57.715
and just enjoy how amazing

17:57.749 --> 17:59.450
those performances were.
We'll sleep on it

17:59.484 --> 18:01.045
and vote tomorrow.
But today, right now,

18:01.053 --> 18:03.220
you are all winners.

18:08.092 --> 18:10.527
Knight takes pawn.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.434
Kiki, your move.

18:17.468 --> 18:20.837
KIKI:
Pawn to A6.

18:20.872 --> 18:24.574
Clever, for a pinko Communist.

18:24.609 --> 18:26.777
- Knight to C3.
- Brittany,

18:26.811 --> 18:28.912
what the hell is this?

18:28.947 --> 18:31.882
The chess club is
helping me re-create

18:31.916 --> 18:35.252
the historic 1972
World Championship

18:35.286 --> 18:37.054
between Bobby Fischer
and Boris Spassky.

18:37.088 --> 18:40.123
And it's the only
creative outlet I have

18:40.158 --> 18:43.060
now that my life is one
never-ending math equation.

18:43.094 --> 18:45.429
This is freaking me out.

18:45.463 --> 18:47.464
This is not you.

18:47.498 --> 18:49.032
You love to dance.

18:49.067 --> 18:51.902
And I know that you think that
you're a little rusty right now,

18:51.936 --> 18:53.570
but you'll get it back.

18:53.604 --> 18:55.806
I'll prove it to you.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.874
Let's do a number together.

18:57.909 --> 19:00.577
No. Those days are over.

19:00.611 --> 19:02.045
This is my life now.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.815
Bishop to E3.

19:05.984 --> 19:07.384
MERCEDES:
It all comes down

19:07.418 --> 19:08.719
to how cool you are.

19:08.753 --> 19:10.687
Rachel Berry, she
represents Broadway,

19:10.722 --> 19:11.922
the past.

19:11.956 --> 19:14.758
I'm the future. A pop diva.

19:14.792 --> 19:16.426
I mean, she may be a pop diva,

19:16.461 --> 19:18.795
but the fact is that
this song is a hit

19:18.830 --> 19:20.897
from one of the longest-running
Broadway musicals of all time.

19:20.932 --> 19:23.100
Question: Why do they
call it Broadway

19:23.134 --> 19:25.969
when most of the theaters
are actually not on Broadway?

19:26.004 --> 19:27.738
MERCEDES: You know, this
vote asks the question,

19:27.772 --> 19:28.972
what is Glee Club?

19:29.007 --> 19:31.408
I mean, is it a training ground
for-for theme park

19:31.442 --> 19:33.877
and cruise ship performers
who can't wait to get on

19:33.911 --> 19:36.847
some outdoor stage
and belt out <i>Pippin,</i>

19:36.881 --> 19:38.915
or is it a place
where stars are born?

19:38.950 --> 19:41.885
You know, the kind of stars that
you actually hear on the radio.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.421
I beat Kurt singing this song
in our first diva-off.

19:44.455 --> 19:45.722
I am better than her.

19:45.757 --> 19:47.657
I've always been better
than her.

19:47.692 --> 19:49.326
Just vote for me.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.562
And let's settle this
once and for all time.

19:52.597 --> 19:53.897
Amen.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.332
(school bell rings)

19:55.366 --> 19:57.501
So, you two
are getting hitched?

19:57.535 --> 19:58.969
When's the happy occasion?

19:59.003 --> 20:00.670
Well, we don't know just yet.

20:00.705 --> 20:03.306
We were gonna wait later
in the year to set a date.

20:03.341 --> 20:04.975
We're enjoying
a long engagement.

20:05.009 --> 20:06.610
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

20:06.644 --> 20:08.979
If I've said it once,
I've said it a million times:

20:09.013 --> 20:13.050
The one thing this country
needs more of is teen marriage.

20:13.084 --> 20:15.552
I got you a wedding present.

20:15.586 --> 20:16.920
It's a little hooch.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.422
Oh.
Oh.

20:18.456 --> 20:19.990
It'll help dull
the excruciating pain

20:20.024 --> 20:22.626
of your wedding night sodomy
and the inevitable divorce

20:22.660 --> 20:25.162
that you're careening towards
a couple months later.

20:25.196 --> 20:26.730
Okay, guys, we're having
our secret ballot

20:26.764 --> 20:27.998
at the end of class,

20:28.032 --> 20:29.699
but before we get to that,
Puckerman

20:29.734 --> 20:31.201
has asked to do a number.

20:31.235 --> 20:34.404
Actually, Mr. Shue, I was hoping
for this number that...

20:34.439 --> 20:35.872
Hold up, hold up,
Private Puckerman.

20:35.907 --> 20:37.174
I'm gonna let you finish,

20:37.208 --> 20:39.309
but first, I would like
to uphold the tradition

20:39.343 --> 20:42.846
of hijacking this glee club
and making everyone

20:42.880 --> 20:44.548
sit through what is
basically an intervention.

20:44.582 --> 20:47.217
Mr. Shue, you said
that we could redo

20:47.251 --> 20:48.518
some of our favorite
numbers, right?

20:48.553 --> 20:50.553
Well, then I want to do
a dance duet with Brittany.

20:50.555 --> 20:52.355
(cheering)

20:52.390 --> 20:54.057
Hit it.

25:41.445 --> 25:43.580

forgotten about it.

26:13.567 --> 26:14.633
Excuse me, Schuester.

26:14.668 --> 26:16.435

another pointless vote

26:16.469 --> 26:18.671
in a meaningless contest

26:18.705 --> 26:21.607
that has absolutely no practical
ramifications whatsoever,

26:21.641 --> 26:22.808
I would like to say

26:22.842 --> 26:24.602
some words about
my good friend Rachel Berry.

26:26.546 --> 26:29.381
Rachel Berry is the most

26:29.416 --> 26:30.883
horrible human being
on the planet.

26:30.917 --> 26:32.818
- What?
- Can it, troll.

26:32.852 --> 26:34.386
Santana... SANTANA:
You have sold

26:34.421 --> 26:36.255
half the people in this room
down the river

26:36.289 --> 26:37.590
more times than I can count

26:37.624 --> 26:40.192
so that you can get a solo
or the lead in a musical,

26:40.226 --> 26:42.194
and I'm pretty sure
that you don't know the names

26:42.228 --> 26:43.562
of the other half of the people.

26:43.597 --> 26:44.697
That's not true.

26:44.731 --> 26:46.432
All right, what is his name?

26:46.466 --> 26:47.266
Rick.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.381
SANTANA:
Exactly. Thank you.

26:48.401 --> 26:50.235
See, you've all
met Rachel, okay?

26:50.270 --> 26:51.537
But I've... I live with her.

26:51.571 --> 26:54.073
Let me tell you what it's like

26:54.107 --> 26:55.407
to share a bathroom with this

26:55.442 --> 26:57.343
stubby, undergrown
little cretin.

26:57.377 --> 26:59.511
Someone in that apartment

26:59.546 --> 27:00.846
shaves their face

27:00.880 --> 27:02.348
and leaves their stubble
in the sink,

27:02.382 --> 27:04.550
and we all know it ain't
Kurt, so do the math.

27:04.584 --> 27:06.385
That's a lie. SANTANA: You
know what else is a lie?

27:06.419 --> 27:07.920
When you won Prom Queen.

27:07.954 --> 27:09.234
What? SANTANA: Yeah,
that's right.

27:09.255 --> 27:10.556
You didn't win, okay?

27:10.590 --> 27:12.324
Everybody just felt
really bad for you,

27:12.359 --> 27:13.799
and the two people
that you hate most

27:13.827 --> 27:15.060
in this whole world,
Quinn and I,

27:15.095 --> 27:17.062
stuffed the ballot box
so that you would win.

27:17.097 --> 27:19.965
You're so cruel, Santana.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.967
I mean, you're only
doing this to me

27:22.002 --> 27:23.502
because I'm the lead
of <i>Funny Girl</i>

27:23.536 --> 27:25.270
and you're just
the lowly understudy.

27:25.305 --> 27:28.507
You want to make me feel bad
because I'm better than you.

27:28.541 --> 27:30.542
And you're an awful person.

27:31.778 --> 27:33.712
Oh! I feel so much better.
Let's vote.

27:33.747 --> 27:35.414
(school bell ringing)

27:37.000 --> 27:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here

27:48.495 --> 27:51.063
Well, that Santana rant
really brought me back.

27:52.666 --> 27:54.199
(crying):
You don't even know

27:54.234 --> 27:55.501
what it's like in New York.

27:55.535 --> 27:57.269
I mean, Santana and I

27:57.303 --> 27:58.604
were close for like a minute,

27:58.638 --> 28:00.305
but now it's like
every single day

28:00.340 --> 28:01.607
is exactly like that.

28:01.641 --> 28:04.443
And now it's like
no matter where I go

28:04.477 --> 28:07.279
or what I do, I'm just back
in high school again.

28:07.313 --> 28:09.314
(sobs)

28:10.350 --> 28:11.316
(exhales)

28:11.351 --> 28:12.484
(sniffs)

28:12.519 --> 28:13.819
You know, every time a producer

28:13.853 --> 28:15.287
or an agent tells me that

28:15.321 --> 28:16.321
I'm not good enough

28:16.356 --> 28:18.490
or that I'm not ready...

28:18.525 --> 28:21.126
God, it's like
Santana is saying it.

28:21.161 --> 28:23.028
Or Puck or Quinn

28:23.063 --> 28:24.630
or anybody that's been here

28:24.664 --> 28:26.665
that's ever made me feel small.

28:27.801 --> 28:29.868
Sometimes it's even you.

28:29.903 --> 28:32.438
I'm one of your
high school ghosts?

28:32.472 --> 28:33.439
(sniffs)

28:33.473 --> 28:35.274
It's not necessarily
a bad thing.

28:35.308 --> 28:37.376
I just use all of that stuff,

28:37.410 --> 28:39.478
and I let it motivate me.

28:39.512 --> 28:41.780
It just makes me sad
that you would think

28:41.815 --> 28:43.282
that I'm one of
your tormentors.

28:43.316 --> 28:45.350
I guess I just...

28:45.385 --> 28:47.186
I don't know, I had this

28:47.220 --> 28:48.987
feeling that it was
always me and you

28:49.022 --> 28:50.456
against everyone else.

28:50.490 --> 28:52.491
You were never like them.

28:53.660 --> 28:55.127
You were just always

28:55.161 --> 28:57.196
the best damn singer
that I've ever heard.

28:58.398 --> 29:00.866
You know, and I want you
to be all big

29:00.900 --> 29:02.701
and rich and famous.

29:02.736 --> 29:04.036
I just want to be richer...

29:04.070 --> 29:05.604
(laughs) and bigger...

29:05.638 --> 29:07.573
and more famous.

29:07.607 --> 29:08.574
(laughs)

29:08.608 --> 29:09.975
Oh, don't you think that

29:10.009 --> 29:12.044
Beyoncé and Barbra
feel that way?

29:12.078 --> 29:14.480
Girl, I don't know. Ask me
when I get my first gold record.

29:14.514 --> 29:16.148
(laughs) Okay?

29:16.182 --> 29:17.916
(laughing) Well, I mean,

29:17.951 --> 29:19.251
I will have won

29:19.285 --> 29:20.686
my first Tony by then, so...
Oh...

29:20.720 --> 29:23.555
Come here.
(laughs)

29:23.590 --> 29:25.824
Oh...

29:25.859 --> 29:28.260
After the unpleasantness
of our last encounter,

29:28.294 --> 29:30.662
I decided to do
some deep background

29:30.697 --> 29:32.865
to investigate your claims,

29:32.899 --> 29:35.667
conducted in an intensive
Wikipedia search

29:35.702 --> 29:38.170
that took all of 25 seconds.

29:38.204 --> 29:40.305
You, April Rhodes,

29:40.340 --> 29:41.707
were the mistress of

29:41.741 --> 29:43.342
local strip-mall magnate
Buddy Leibowitz,

29:43.343 --> 29:46.011
whose wife offered
you $2 million

29:46.045 --> 29:47.646
to keep the affair quiet

29:47.680 --> 29:49.548
after her husband's
untimely demise.

29:49.582 --> 29:51.717
It was that money
that you placed into an annuity

29:51.751 --> 29:54.653
to fund the auditorium
in perpetuity.

29:54.687 --> 29:56.255
That's right.

29:56.289 --> 29:57.589
Well, it didn't last.

29:57.624 --> 30:00.292
In fact, that money
ran out six weeks ago.

30:00.326 --> 30:01.393
How?

30:01.427 --> 30:03.662
Will Schuester's
profligate spending

30:03.696 --> 30:07.232
and his penchant for staging
elaborate private bacchanalia

30:07.267 --> 30:10.536
replete with extravagant
scenery and costumes

30:10.570 --> 30:12.871
not seen since
the reign of Caligula.

30:12.906 --> 30:14.907
I have here
a line-item budget

30:14.941 --> 30:16.809
of the jungle set
you constructed

30:16.843 --> 30:18.177
onstage a few weeks back

30:18.211 --> 30:19.912
so the glee club could perform

30:19.946 --> 30:21.079
a Katy Perry song

30:21.114 --> 30:23.615
literally for just you.

30:23.650 --> 30:25.384
Whoa, whoa, hold-hold on.
Let-let me see that.

30:25.418 --> 30:27.286
I don't know what
the problem is,

30:27.320 --> 30:29.221
but whatever money
the glee club needs,

30:29.255 --> 30:30.355
I'm good for it.

30:30.390 --> 30:31.690
April Rhodes is rich!

30:31.724 --> 30:33.926
No, April Rhodes
is under indictment

30:33.960 --> 30:35.594
from the Securities
and Exchange Commission

30:35.628 --> 30:38.597
and in violation of
her $3 million bail

30:38.631 --> 30:41.099
that forbids her from leaving
the state of New York.

30:41.134 --> 30:42.467
Oh, snap!

30:42.502 --> 30:43.702
Wait, what?

30:43.736 --> 30:45.370
Well, what April may have
neglected to mention

30:45.405 --> 30:47.172
is that her most recent john

30:47.207 --> 30:49.942
was none other than
the disgraced financier

30:49.976 --> 30:51.443
Bernie Madoff.

30:51.477 --> 30:53.312
All of April's assets,

30:53.346 --> 30:54.546
including her private island,

30:54.581 --> 30:55.647
have been frozen.

30:55.682 --> 30:57.416
April, is this true?

30:57.450 --> 30:58.450
Gulp.

30:58.484 --> 30:59.885
Sure sounds true, doesn't it?

30:59.919 --> 31:00.886
I'm sorry, Will.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.454
It does appear that

31:02.488 --> 31:04.890
the glee club is indeed over.

31:04.924 --> 31:05.757
(gasps dramatically)

31:05.792 --> 31:08.527
APRIL:
Will, wait! Wait!

31:08.561 --> 31:09.561
This is yours.
Yes.

31:09.596 --> 31:10.796
Will, wait!
I can explain...

31:10.830 --> 31:12.564
Explain what, April?

31:12.599 --> 31:13.765
That's you're a
pathological liar

31:13.800 --> 31:15.033
whom I never should
have trusted?

31:15.068 --> 31:16.635
Yes, exactly.

31:16.669 --> 31:18.337
You did the worst thing

31:18.371 --> 31:20.672
you possibly could've done.

31:20.707 --> 31:22.140
You gave me hope.

31:25.778 --> 31:28.685
What are you talking
about? A tattoo?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.387
It's not that bad.
I mean, it was...

31:30.421 --> 31:31.742
On your lower back?
Ryan Seacrest?

31:31.756 --> 31:32.889
I could get it removed.

31:32.924 --> 31:34.124
There's not a laser big enough.

31:34.158 --> 31:35.258
It's the size of Texas.

31:35.293 --> 31:36.693
You should've told
me this weeks ago.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.228
We're in the 20th century.
That doesn't make sense.

31:38.262 --> 31:39.496
The 21st, almost.
Is there a problem here?

31:39.530 --> 31:40.731
Puck, go away.
Okay? We're...

31:40.765 --> 31:42.366
Was she always this
big of a liar?

31:42.400 --> 31:43.867
QUINN:
I'm coming clean now.

31:43.901 --> 31:45.302
Doesn't that mean something?

31:45.336 --> 31:46.503
Wh... a baby?

31:46.537 --> 31:48.505
I mean, what happens
if we got married

31:48.539 --> 31:50.273
and this kid shows up
looking for money?

31:50.308 --> 31:51.475
Are you crazy?

31:51.509 --> 31:53.310
Was this the loser
who knocked you up?

31:53.344 --> 31:54.911
Yes, yes. Puck is the father.
Yeah.

31:54.946 --> 31:56.413
I am looking for
acceptance here, okay?

31:56.447 --> 31:57.547
This is how I love.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.116
That may be how you

31:59.150 --> 32:00.283
and your loser friends love,

32:00.318 --> 32:01.418
but where I come from,

32:01.452 --> 32:02.819
you carry your past with you.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.188
You are the worst
kind of hypocrite.

32:05.223 --> 32:06.590
You walk around
like you're some

32:06.624 --> 32:07.691
Snow frickin' White,
but you're really

32:07.725 --> 32:09.059
just a dirty little slutbag.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.894
Ow, ow, ow, ow! You
shouldn't have said that.

32:10.928 --> 32:11.895
Let go of my nose!

32:11.929 --> 32:13.663
Ow, God, let go!
Am I bleeding?

32:13.698 --> 32:14.898
Not yet.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.166
(grunting)

32:16.200 --> 32:17.267
You're hurting him! Stop!

32:17.301 --> 32:18.268
PUCK:
Kind of the point!

32:18.302 --> 32:19.269
QUINN:
Knock it off!

32:19.303 --> 32:20.504
Stop!

32:27.278 --> 32:28.779
Help me get him out of here.

32:28.813 --> 32:29.880
Do you have any idea

32:29.914 --> 32:31.048
how much better you are
than this guy?

32:31.082 --> 32:32.516
Look, you can crawl
into the trash

32:32.550 --> 32:33.683
and help him out,

32:33.718 --> 32:35.352
or you can come be
with your real friends

32:35.386 --> 32:36.987
in the choir room.

32:37.021 --> 32:38.255
I'll be waiting.

32:41.726 --> 32:43.393
(school bell ringing)

32:43.428 --> 32:45.108
WILL: All right, everybody.
It's time to get

32:45.129 --> 32:46.530
this voting nonsense
out of the way

32:46.564 --> 32:49.232
so that we can continue on
with what you all came here for:

32:49.267 --> 32:50.700
the music.

32:50.735 --> 32:53.336
Y'all can use your left hand
for anonymity.

32:53.371 --> 32:54.371
But I'm left-handed.

32:54.405 --> 32:55.939
Then use a foot.
Okay.

32:55.973 --> 32:57.507
♪

33:01.279 --> 33:02.913
Dude, who you putting on?

33:02.947 --> 33:04.081
Well, I'm torn.

33:04.115 --> 33:05.615
One is black and one is Jewish.

33:08.086 --> 33:09.586
Okay, that's everybody.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.659
So, um,

33:15.693 --> 33:18.395
sorry about that
outburst earlier.

33:18.429 --> 33:20.564
Mercedes and I
have been talking.

33:20.598 --> 33:24.034
And we both realize that
asking you guys to vote

33:24.068 --> 33:26.636
for who's more talented is just,
it's completely ridiculous,

33:26.671 --> 33:27.704
unproductive

33:27.738 --> 33:29.906
and narcissistic. I mean,

33:29.941 --> 33:31.475
how could we ask you guys

33:31.509 --> 33:33.777
to choose between two
beautiful queen divas?

33:33.811 --> 33:35.132
Well, funny enough,
they did vote,

33:35.146 --> 33:36.313
and they did choose.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.348
And guess what.

33:38.382 --> 33:40.684
You're both equally talented
in their eyes.

33:40.718 --> 33:42.819
And mine.
(both laugh)

33:42.854 --> 33:44.121
(applause)

33:46.124 --> 33:47.591
Excuse me, excuse me.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.259
I'd like to apologize.

33:49.293 --> 33:51.294
It's not the first time I've
raised someone's hopes

33:51.329 --> 33:54.197
and then left them
on the rocky shores

33:54.232 --> 33:56.266
of disappointment and regret.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.935
Just ask all of my A.A.
sponsors. April?

33:58.970 --> 34:01.404
We just want to spend the rest
of the week singing in peace.

34:01.439 --> 34:03.340
But I did do was use
the last few hours

34:03.374 --> 34:04.674
of my NetJets account

34:04.709 --> 34:06.776
to bring in someone
whose infectious happiness

34:06.811 --> 34:09.446
surely will make the next
few days that much brighter.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.982
Ladies and gentlemen...

34:12.016 --> 34:13.617
(cheering)

34:15.286 --> 34:18.355
<i>Hola, clase.</i>

34:18.389 --> 34:20.357
April, thank you for
buttering the floor for me.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.692
You know I like
to make an entrance.

34:22.726 --> 34:23.693
Wait, I'm-I'm sorry.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.562
How-how do you two
know each other?

34:25.596 --> 34:26.963
Oh, because there's
a whole Facebook page

34:26.998 --> 34:28.364
for people who were
guests of Glee Club.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.498
I'm on it, April...

34:29.534 --> 34:31.333
Blaine's brother, Rachel's mom,

34:31.369 --> 34:32.435
that Mexican guy.

34:32.469 --> 34:33.436
(laughs):
Holly...

34:33.471 --> 34:35.038
This is amazing.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.139
Where have you been?

34:36.174 --> 34:37.741
Oh, I've been everywhere.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.409
I quit being a
substitute teacher

34:39.443 --> 34:41.344
because I couldn't
stand being tied down.

34:41.379 --> 34:43.547
I like teaching a room
full of kids if I know

34:43.581 --> 34:44.781
I'm never gonna see them again,

34:44.815 --> 34:46.516
but then, if you're
any good at it,

34:46.551 --> 34:47.617
they keep asking you back,

34:47.652 --> 34:49.585
which kind of
defeats the purpose.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.487
So, I started my trademark

34:51.522 --> 34:53.723
Holly Holliday Teachin' Pop-Ups.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.257
I just show up at a classroom

34:55.293 --> 34:57.092
unannounced, teach a lesson

34:57.128 --> 34:58.628
and get the hell out of there.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.664
(old-timey voice):
Hello!

35:00.698 --> 35:04.401
I'm William Henry Harrison,
America's worst president.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.537
I exterminated a nation
of Native Americans,

35:07.572 --> 35:08.872
and it got me elected.

35:08.906 --> 35:11.641
But I refused to wear a coat
to my inauguration,

35:11.676 --> 35:13.810
so I caught a cold
and died a month later.

35:13.844 --> 35:15.845
I accomplished nothing!
(footsteps approaching)

35:15.880 --> 35:16.913
WOMAN:
There she is!

35:16.948 --> 35:18.582
She just showed up,
and she took

35:18.616 --> 35:19.816
over my class!

35:19.850 --> 35:21.618
Tippy-canoe!

35:21.652 --> 35:23.687
But when I heard
Glee Club was ending,

35:23.721 --> 35:26.256
I ripped off my Pol Pot uniform,

35:26.290 --> 35:28.625
hopped on that first flight
out of Buenos Aires

35:28.659 --> 35:30.627
and came to pay my respects.

35:30.661 --> 35:31.828
Uh, Holly, you know
that we're singing

35:31.862 --> 35:32.929
our favorite Glee Club songs

35:32.964 --> 35:34.431
we've already sung before.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.099
That's a terrible idea!

35:36.133 --> 35:38.268
Listen, that might be
fine for you nerds,

35:38.302 --> 35:40.470
but when Holly Holliday
is in town,

35:40.504 --> 35:43.173
this hot bitch is not looking
in the rearview mirror;

35:43.207 --> 35:44.874
she's looking forward.

35:44.909 --> 35:45.976
Hit it!

(cheering)

38:05.122 --> 38:07.089
(school bell rings)

38:22.039 --> 38:24.040
He forgave us for
what we did, right?

38:27.444 --> 38:31.013
A long time ago.

38:31.048 --> 38:33.015
And we saved him.

38:33.050 --> 38:34.851
Rachel was his soul mate.

38:34.885 --> 38:36.419
Who's yours?

38:36.453 --> 38:37.854
Biff?

38:37.888 --> 38:40.423
He's going back to Yale.

38:40.457 --> 38:41.958
Alone.

38:41.992 --> 38:43.526
SANTANA:
<i>This is so not cool.</i>

38:43.560 --> 38:45.995
Okay, they can't just
chain you to a calculator

38:46.029 --> 38:47.763
and keep you as
their math monkey.

38:47.798 --> 38:49.532
Wait, do those actually exist?

38:49.566 --> 38:51.801
You need to be having a life.

38:51.835 --> 38:53.436
You need to be out in the world

38:53.470 --> 38:55.538
going to restaurants
and concerts and...

38:55.572 --> 38:58.107
and dating.

38:58.141 --> 39:01.344
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
blow this place, too.

39:01.378 --> 39:05.281
Unless there's a reason
for me to stay.

39:05.315 --> 39:07.984
'Cause I know who
my soul mate is.

39:18.161 --> 39:19.829
Okay, um...

39:19.863 --> 39:23.799
it's a bad idea.

39:23.834 --> 39:26.269
You don't want me.
I'm terrible at having

39:26.303 --> 39:29.138
a relationship that involves
any level of honesty.

39:29.172 --> 39:31.807
I love you.

39:31.842 --> 39:34.410
Just tell me to stay.

39:34.444 --> 39:36.412
'Cause the truth is
there's only one guy

39:36.446 --> 39:39.248
that you were ever
really honest with.

39:39.283 --> 39:42.285
It feels really good
to be around you.

39:42.319 --> 39:44.587
You make me feel
like a girl again.

39:44.621 --> 39:46.122
Like, my body wakes up.

39:48.225 --> 39:49.592
Please don't do this, okay?

39:49.626 --> 39:52.461
I have worked my ass
off to get over you.

39:55.465 --> 39:57.800
I really want
to be with you, Santana.

39:57.834 --> 40:00.870
I've seen the world,
and I'm sure now more than ever

40:00.904 --> 40:02.805
that I belong with you.

40:02.839 --> 40:05.041
And I'm sure
your girlfriend's great,

40:05.075 --> 40:07.109
but you can't re-create

40:07.144 --> 40:09.345
what you and I have.

40:09.379 --> 40:11.647
Just tell me to stay.

40:11.682 --> 40:13.449
Please.

40:15.218 --> 40:18.020
So, it's your choice.

40:20.123 --> 40:22.124
If you want me, I'm here.

40:42.479 --> 40:44.480
♪

41:03.800 --> 41:05.768
Stay.

41:12.042 --> 41:14.643
I want to show you
guys something.

41:14.678 --> 41:16.812
All of you that were together
from the very beginning

41:16.847 --> 41:18.514
when the glee club
was just a dream.

41:23.587 --> 41:26.088
(sighs)

41:26.123 --> 41:29.392
Their new and final
resting places.

41:29.426 --> 41:31.727
For as long
as McKinley's around,

41:31.762 --> 41:34.797
all the students who travel
through this auditorium

41:34.831 --> 41:36.899
are gonna see these.

41:36.933 --> 41:39.335
And have absolutely no idea
who they are.

41:39.369 --> 41:40.736
You know what? This is crazy.

41:40.771 --> 41:42.972
Because I could really give
two poops about this place,

41:43.006 --> 41:45.207
but this is
really getting to me.

41:45.242 --> 41:47.777
I know. Why is that?

41:47.811 --> 41:49.512
WILL: We were all raised
by different parents.

41:49.546 --> 41:51.914
But we grew up together
in the glee club.

41:51.948 --> 41:53.849
It's a part of all of us.

41:53.884 --> 41:55.418
Of course you're sad about it.

41:55.452 --> 41:57.253
I don't know, Mr. Schue.

41:57.287 --> 41:59.588
With this and Finn,

41:59.623 --> 42:02.458
it's kind of hard
to believe that anything lasts.

42:02.492 --> 42:04.660
I don't have any more pep talks.

42:04.694 --> 42:06.962
I just have you guys.

42:06.997 --> 42:09.465
And the memory
of the people on this wall.

42:11.101 --> 42:13.235
My friends.

42:13.270 --> 42:17.206
I mean, we share
this special bond.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.375
We're the only ones
in the world who-who know

42:19.409 --> 42:20.910
what this glee club
meant to us.

42:20.944 --> 42:23.145
What it felt like
to sing together.

42:23.180 --> 42:26.749
To be... to be together.

42:26.783 --> 42:30.119
And what it feels like
to say good-bye to it.

42:30.153 --> 42:32.388
I didn't come here
to cheer you up.

42:32.422 --> 42:33.923
Just to thank you.

42:35.859 --> 42:38.194
(crying): To thank you for
going on this ride with me.

42:48.872 --> 42:50.606
All right, come on.

42:50.640 --> 42:53.008
We've still got
a few days until, uh,

42:53.043 --> 42:55.644
Sue shuts the lights out
on the choir room, so...

42:55.679 --> 42:57.613
let's make the most of them.

43:02.219 --> 43:04.520
I mean, I know we got to
finish our wine first.

43:04.554 --> 43:07.156
Mmm.
But when we do, we cannot let

43:07.190 --> 43:09.325
that glee club go
the way of the dodo.

43:09.359 --> 43:11.827
Oh, couldn't have said it
better myself.

43:11.862 --> 43:14.330
Holly Holliday...

43:15.815 --> 43:17.479
we're going to save
that glee club.
