00:00.901 --> 00:04.705
So, there's a few things
I like to do before I sing.

00:04.771 --> 00:08.074
-OK. Me too.
-I call them my warm-ups.

00:08.141 --> 00:10.577
You too? What are yours?

00:10.644 --> 00:14.214
OK. My nose goes like this, and I go:

00:14.281 --> 00:16.416
"I can't stand it.

00:16.483 --> 00:19.920
Stand it."

00:20.454 --> 00:21.288
OK.

00:21.355 --> 00:25.692
Another one that I sing is
Lil Wayne's name, high to low.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.262
-Are you making these up?
-No, I swear.

00:28.328 --> 00:32.665
Weezy, Weezy, Weezy, Weezy

00:34.401 --> 00:36.403
What's your warm-up?

00:36.870 --> 00:40.107
My warm-up is we scream.
For starters.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.877
-Before shows?
-Every show.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.613
This one's a little weird.
You need to slap me.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.248
-You're lying.
-Nope.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.318
But how hard?
I'm Latin, so it's like a lot.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.154
Go for it. I'm ready.
You've got it.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.457
-Yes!
-Yes!

01:20.080 --> 01:21.081
Eyes on the road!

01:39.600 --> 01:40.667
Nice!

01:43.537 --> 01:44.371
Oh, yeah!

02:23.810 --> 02:26.180
Do you remember the first time…

02:26.246 --> 02:28.448
-That we met?
-Yeah.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.184
-I feel like I do.
-When was it?

02:30.250 --> 02:33.554
I feel like the first time we
met was on an award show.

02:33.620 --> 02:38.258
Wrong, because you weren't fully
aware the first time we met.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.226
Ooh.

02:39.293 --> 02:43.330
I freaked out a bit because
I was a Jonas Brothers fan.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.264
Yes.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.367
Yeah. I have this picture.
It's kind of funny.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.437
I took this picture
without you knowing.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.841
-You look great.
-This is a great photo.

03:00.147 --> 03:04.284
Since you are a fan, do you have
a favourite Jonas Brother song?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.686
I like "Still in Love with You".

03:16.964 --> 03:19.366
-Yeah.
-I haven't heard it in a while.

03:19.433 --> 03:24.371
You brought me back for a second.
I had longer hair than yours.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.607
What was your favourite
song to perform?

03:26.673 --> 03:28.942
"Turn Right".
Are you familiar with that song?

03:29.076 --> 03:30.611
From Lines, Vines and Trying Times ?

03:30.677 --> 03:31.512
I believe it is.

03:31.578 --> 03:37.618
Since you're a Jonas expert,
I have a fun game for you.

03:38.085 --> 03:42.422
Of Jonas related questions to
see you know your stuff. Ready?

03:45.125 --> 03:49.096
I think we all know by now
that I'm gonna kill this.

03:49.096 --> 03:52.332
Our acting debut was on which show?

03:52.399 --> 03:53.634
Hannah Montana.

03:53.700 --> 03:58.705
Wow! What song
did Nick write about...

03:58.772 --> 04:00.607
his struggle with diabetes?

04:00.674 --> 04:02.042
"A Little Bit Longer".

04:02.042 --> 04:04.878
What's the correct order
from oldest to youngest?

04:04.945 --> 04:08.048
Kevin, you, Nick.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.684
That was easy.
What's the name of the Bonus Jonas?

04:10.751 --> 04:14.421
-Frankie.
-What is Kevin's ultimate man accessory?

04:14.488 --> 04:16.656
I don't know why I first thought...

04:16.723 --> 04:19.059
Never mind. It's inappropriate.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.261
-Just say it.
-Nipples.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.865
-No, but I like it.
-What is it?

04:24.932 --> 04:26.700
-It's bandana.
-No.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.875
Do you do singing impressions?

05:41.942 --> 05:44.578
-OK, give me one.
-Shakira.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.479
OK.

05:45.546 --> 05:50.484
Le ro lo le lo le lo le

05:51.084 --> 05:53.320
Pretty good. Britney Spears?

05:53.754 --> 05:59.760
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?

05:59.826 --> 06:01.161
Pretty good as well.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.730
You know who takes the cake with that?

06:03.797 --> 06:07.301
-Ariana. She's so good.
-Can you do an impression?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.169
Oh, baby

06:09.236 --> 06:11.538
-That's really good.
-Thank you.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.159
Yeah!

06:32.226 --> 06:33.293
Yeah!

06:34.595 --> 06:36.063
Yeah!

06:48.208 --> 06:50.644
-There we go. One, two.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.446
One, two, three, hey.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.033
Cute, I love that song.

07:13.100 --> 07:18.639
I heard that you guys
have this kazoo thing going on.

07:18.705 --> 07:22.609
Oh, yeah. We have a song
that was on our first EP…

07:22.676 --> 07:28.048
and we put a kazoo on the track,
so it sounded kind of quirky.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.218
But Cole plays the kazoo live,
and the crowd goes nuts.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.655
-Do you have one in here?
-Open that up.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.423
-This is a kazoo?
-Yes.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.560
-I've never seen one in my life.
-Now...

07:39.626 --> 07:40.460
Hold on.

07:42.696 --> 07:46.066
-Sing at the back of the throat.
-Should we guess songs?

07:46.133 --> 07:49.369
I'm gonna do a song,
and you will try to guess it.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.470
-Are you ready?
-OK.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.147
-Justin Bieber, duh. Classic.
-Duh. Your turn.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.616
This is gonna be harder
because it's a rap song.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.593
Are you rapping the words…

08:12.659 --> 08:14.094
-Chorus.
-Ok.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.434
I give up.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.736
Sit down, be humble

08:24.037 --> 08:26.473
-I just felt like slapping you.
-I needed that.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.447
Let's sing another song.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.049
Let's do it. Your choice.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.552
-OK.
-Bring me back.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.785
Let's sing a classic.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.657
-OK. Let's do it.
-OK.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.266
-Here we go!

09:51.758 --> 09:54.895
When did you get into music?
Really young, right?

09:54.962 --> 09:58.932
Really young. I was 15,
but started in musical theatre.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.068
How old were you in the X-Factor days?

10:01.101 --> 10:03.103
-I was 15.
-Wow.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.806
I don't know how to drive.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.942
There's a lot of things I didn't
get to do when I was younger.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.512
I never went to prom.
Not a single school dance.

10:11.578 --> 10:15.082
Me neither.
Well, I went to one in fifth grade.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.987
I think we need to go to prom,
so I've prepared something.

10:20.420 --> 10:24.224
It's nothing much.
Kind of a last minute prom.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.560
-We're gonna go to prom!
-Yes.

10:26.627 --> 10:27.761
-Are you down?
-Yes.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.270
Prom, here we come.
Right this way.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.173
This is where kids
make out after school.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.841
Let's ball up.

10:41.542 --> 10:43.143
Hey, guys.

10:43.544 --> 10:45.679
-Hello.
-Hi. Joe, Camila.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.881
We've never been to prom.

10:48.715 --> 10:53.220
I know you're in a game,
but can you help us for five minutes?

10:53.287 --> 10:55.355
-Yeah, all right.
-Sweet.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.198
Lights, please.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.801
Now introducing your prom
king and queen,

11:07.868 --> 11:10.070
Joe Jonas and Camila Cabello.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.608
Wow, thank you so much.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.845
-Thank you.
-Voilà.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.080
-Yeah.
-Beautiful.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.816
-Wow.
-We got to do a first dance.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.084
Mirror ball?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.787
-Whoa.
-I ordered one.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.356
-There it is. Watch the ladder.
-Best prom!

11:29.423 --> 11:31.892
-We'll get the flashlight.
-Music?

11:33.694 --> 11:36.663
-We should give a speech to them.
-Oh yeah, ladies first.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.433
Thank you so much to everybody here.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.704
Thank you, Joe,
to the best prom king ever.

11:43.770 --> 11:47.207
I want to thank the bullies
in high school, because look at me now!

11:47.274 --> 11:48.642
-Yeah!
-In your face.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.878
-What's up?
-Hit it.

11:58.819 --> 11:59.820
-Nah.
-Nah.

12:05.626 --> 12:06.927
Keep going, faster.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.265
-That was so good.
-Best prom ever.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.701
Best first dance. Did you see that?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.204
-Great moves.
-Clean this up, guys.

12:17.271 --> 12:19.072
-We'll see you later.
-Bye.
