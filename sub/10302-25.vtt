02:13.120 --> 02:14.235
Hi, Al Bundy here.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.068
I got any income tax
refund and I wanna blow it all.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.716
How much for a subscription
to "Hot New Boats?"

02:24.120 --> 02:26.111
Gee, that's a little steep.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.954
You gonna have an issue
of "Hot New Hooters?"

02:30.760 --> 02:31.988
Hello?

02:32.480 --> 02:35.153
You know, Al, I know
how you could spend that refund.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.234
I saw this nice bonbon maker
on the Home Shopping Network.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.550
It would make my life a lot easier.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.879
Peg, if your life was any easier
you'd be in an urn in the garage.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.277
You know, you're gonna
change your tune...

02:49.480 --> 02:51.948
...when my homemade bonbons
go national.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.918
I've even got a slogan.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.720
"Put A Wanker In Your Mouth."

02:59.840 --> 03:03.037
No offence, but I wanted to use
my maiden name.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.278
Should use
your mother's maiden name.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.914
"Put An Entire Side of Beef
In Your Mouth."

03:09.760 --> 03:11.352
All right, Al, now close your eyes.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.752
I want you to tell me which one
of these bonbons you like better.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.997
Now, I'm not gonna tell you
which one is mine.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.437
- Not bad.
- Okay.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.636
Now...

03:29.240 --> 03:31.151
...this one.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.633
So, what do you think?

03:52.880 --> 03:54.313
Well, it's...

03:54.720 --> 03:56.631
...got a lot of tang.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.193
Well, it should.
I used a whole jar of it.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.510
All right now, Al.
Tell me what you think, and be honest.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.149
Don't quit your day couch, Peg.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.232
You suck.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.914
I'm gonna go find Marcie.
Get a woman's opinion.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.196
Why, does she know one?

04:19.279 --> 04:21.111
Hey, Al.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.997
- Look, I really need to talk to...
- Hey, Jefferson, come here a minute.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.835
I want you to try
one of my homemade bonbons.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.548
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.838
Where is it?

04:45.160 --> 04:47.276
In this meteorite?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.758
Fruity.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.798
Light. It's the most delicious thing...

05:02.040 --> 05:04.076
Peg's gone.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.989
- What's new?
- Oh, Al, you gotta help me.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.071
I have done something terrible.

05:16.320 --> 05:18.914
I know. I was at the wedding.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.757
Not that.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.918
You know how Marcie's always saying
I'm irresponsible with money?

05:25.160 --> 05:27.594
You mean because you haven't
had a job in three years.

05:29.480 --> 05:34.076
Just because I'm a house-husband
doesn't mean I don't work.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.235
Excuse me, Mr. Jefferson,
I have ironed your socks.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.359
May I please have my five minutes
for lunch now?

05:45.600 --> 05:46.953
No.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.792
Thank you.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.480
Oh, I'm in real trouble, Al.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.156
See, I wanted to prove to Marcie
that I was good with money.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.269
So when her $3000 tax refund came in,
I took it and I invested it.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.748
In what?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.479
Clothes.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.478
Look, Al, I've only got
a couple of hundred left.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.632
I need a good solid 15-to-1 shot.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.433
Well, it's a 15-to-1 shot...

06:17.640 --> 06:20.916
...the next time I'm having sex
Peg will ruin it by walking in on me.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.318
No, not good enough.
I need a sure bet.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.755
Well, it's a sure bet
that this time next year...

06:27.960 --> 06:30.599
...Marcie will be a member
of the Hair Club For Men.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.752
Forget it. I'll just ask somebody...

06:37.960 --> 06:40.713
...who knows more about money
than a shoe salesman.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.311
Yo! Paper boy.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.632
Dad, I gotta ask you a question.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.071
Because we get horny
and don't have the sense to say no.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.511
No. Not that question, Dad.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.911
Well, that's the only one
I have an answer to, Son.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.238
Dad, why is life so unfair?

07:13.480 --> 07:15.471
I mean, I go to college
and get good grades.

07:15.720 --> 07:19.110
- Yes, you do, Son.
- I'm certainly good looking.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.278
Yet some imbecile football player,
with the I.Q. of Buck...

07:25.520 --> 07:27.351
...gets girls, while I get nothing.

07:27.600 --> 07:32.355
The secret of attracting the opposite
sex is in the mutual sniffing of butt.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.436
Bud, let me tell you something.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.274
I was once that imbecile.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.876
I was once that football player.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.671
And if it makes you feel any better,
I am what becomes of them.

07:50.040 --> 07:54.636
They have jobs like mine, houses
like mine and children like mine.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.716
I am your revenge.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.474
So you'd trade places with me?

08:01.680 --> 08:02.908
Are you kidding?

08:06.800 --> 08:08.028
Well, I'm gonna get ready.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.192
Chad's gonna be here
in a few minutes to get tutored.

08:13.320 --> 08:17.154
The pig says, "Oink."

08:18.200 --> 08:20.270
Today is biology.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.350
Thank you, ladies.
Thank you, ladies.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.957
It's time for my lesson now,
but I'll be walking home in an hour.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.113
Don't you hate women hanging
all over you everywhere you go?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.920
Good thing we're at our sexual peak,
hey, buddy?

08:48.560 --> 08:50.198
Sure is.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.436
Chad Dowling.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.434
- Tremaine's All-Star quarterback.
- Yes, sir.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.557
Pleasure to meet you, son.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.028
Al Bundy.

09:03.280 --> 09:05.748
I hope you don't mind me
calling you "son."

09:06.000 --> 09:07.513
No offence...

09:09.760 --> 09:12.069
- Bud.
- Bud. Yeah.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.270
I'm sure my son here
has told you all about me.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.313
Al Bundy. Polk High.
Four touchdowns, one game.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.200
Actually, he told me
more about his real father.

09:22.440 --> 09:26.718
The green beret who got lost
in that recon mission over in Nam.

09:29.360 --> 09:34.957
Yeah, well, his real mother,
the late Totie Fields, took that hard.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.839
Took that real hard.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.470
Well, come on. Let's sit down, son.
Let's talk a little football.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.909
Excuse me, Dad.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.076
You know, Mr. Bundy,
if you're such a fan...

09:44.280 --> 09:46.840
...you ought to come
to our homecoming game this weekend.

09:47.040 --> 09:51.079
We're playing our traditional rival, the
Sonora Screaming Desert Tortoises.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.155
Hey, I hear they're tough this year.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.675
- We got a lot of work...
- You ought to be there.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.150
- We're gonna kill them.
- You're that good, huh?

09:59.400 --> 10:02.676
No. Probably shouldn't
tell you this...

10:02.920 --> 10:06.754
...but I just found out their quarterback
will be out on academic probation.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.913
Man, if we were allowed to cash in the
free cars the alumni gave us and bet...

10:11.160 --> 10:13.754
...l'd put the farm on this one.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.113
Especially before the word gets out.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.433
The cow says, "Moo."

10:26.760 --> 10:28.398
What is it, Al?

10:28.640 --> 10:29.868
- Jefferson?
- Yeah?

10:30.080 --> 10:32.753
- Look over there. You see that kid?
- Yeah.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.911
That's your 15-to-1 shot.

10:35.160 --> 10:40.712
If a cow says, "Moo,"
does a moose say, "Cow?"

10:45.480 --> 10:48.756
What am I betting,
that one day he'll sell shoes?

10:50.960 --> 10:53.554
That's Chad Dowling,
Tremaine's All-Star quarterback.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.189
He told me that the quarterback
for the opposing team...

10:56.440 --> 10:59.750
...is out on probation and won't play
in the big game on Saturday...

11:00.000 --> 11:02.719
...but the best part is...

11:02.960 --> 11:05.428
...nobody knows about it yet.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.393
Are you sure about this, Al?

11:07.640 --> 11:10.871
Because if you're not,
Marcie's gonna hurt me bad.

11:12.640 --> 11:19.079
Jefferson, do you think I would bet
my $17.34 tax refund if I wasn't sure?

11:19.320 --> 11:21.914
I don't know much,
but I know football.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.431
You're right on both counts.

11:24.680 --> 11:28.309
Oh, Al, you're the last friend
I've ever had.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.676
I gotta go call my bookie.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.593
Okay, Chad, look,
we covered a lot of ground today...

11:33.840 --> 11:35.512
...so just go home and get some rest.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.312
Yeah, I'm beat.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.028
It's like when you've had
so much sex you can barely...

11:40.280 --> 11:42.271
Just get out, okay?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.558
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Bundy.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.234
And by the way,
why didn't you ever play college ball?

11:48.480 --> 11:51.756
Well, that's a long, sad story, Chad.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.353
Excuse us.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.751
It was 20 years ago...

11:58.000 --> 12:00.195
...Polk High's big game.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.113
My girlfriend at the time...
Well, later became my wife...

12:03.360 --> 12:05.476
...but that's another tragic tale.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.471
- had this little habit of shouting at me
while I was in the game.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.393
Of course, I hated that, so of course,
she shouted at me...

12:12.640 --> 12:14.596
...one time
when a 300-pound linebacker...

12:14.840 --> 12:16.751
...was barrelling down on me...

12:17.000 --> 12:20.436
...and when I came to,
I had two kids and was selling shoes.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.077
- Whoa, tough luck.
- Well, but I bounced right back.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.073
I mean, when I'm 65
I'll get the golden shoehorn.

12:27.320 --> 12:31.154
Which I can sharpen
and fall onto when I'm 66.

12:31.520 --> 12:35.752
So, what I'm trying to say, son,
is learn from my mistakes.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.992
Don't ever let a woman
take over your life.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.277
Oh, you don't have to worry
about me, Mr. Bundy.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.318
I'm way too young to fall in love.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.030
Hey, Daddy, guess what?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.036
Oh, pumpkin?

13:07.160 --> 13:09.116
Oh, Chad?

13:10.200 --> 13:12.031
Oh, no!

13:17.920 --> 13:21.469
So anyway, Marcie,
I just tripled a few of the ingredients.

13:21.720 --> 13:26.874
Well, actually, I tripled the sugar
and added a little bit more caffeine.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.000
So tell me,
do you think it's too much?

13:30.240 --> 13:32.151
No, I think they're great.
Give me more.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.870
I don't care what the scientists say
about sugar, they lie. I hate them all.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.111
Al's home. I hate you.
Welcome home, Al.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.078
How was your day?
I've had a great day.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.840
Haven't got my tax refund.
It'll come soon. Gonna be big.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.038
Have you tasted Peggy's bonbons?
I wonder what's on TV tonight.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.232
It's Sunday. Oh, no, Carlin's on.
Al's home. Hi, Al.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.870
Who put the battery
in the Energizer Chicken?

14:03.480 --> 14:08.156
Gee, maybe I made this batch
a tad too sweet.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.356
Here, Buck, what do you think?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.909
Peg, have you seen Kelly and Chad?

14:13.160 --> 14:14.673
Yeah. They went to the zoo.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.876
Yeah, but I heard
he missed practice today.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.953
- So?
- So? Peg, don't you understand...

14:20.200 --> 14:21.428
...if Chad doesn't...

14:26.040 --> 14:29.715
You know, it's not gonna be
a pretty sight when she crashes.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.268
Or when he does.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.876
I'm gonna kill them. I'm gonna wait
until they're asleep, then kill them.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.834
Then I'm gonna eat them. Kill them,
eat them, then bury their bones.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.233
I knew this would happen.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.597
Kelly's making it hard for Chad
to concentrate on the game.

14:45.840 --> 14:49.071
Relax, Al.
They're just a couple of kids in love.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.709
They remind me of us
when we were that age.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.633
That's exactly why
I have to put a stop to it.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.833
I used to have such pretty hair.

15:03.080 --> 15:07.517
Where, oh, where is my pretty hair?

15:09.720 --> 15:11.233
I'm getting old.

15:11.480 --> 15:15.029
I knew it when I stopped
lifting my leg to pee.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.037
My God, I'm peeing right now.

15:26.280 --> 15:30.592
Help me, bonbon lady,
please help me.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.115
Oh, come on, Marcie.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.351
Maybe shopping
will make you feel better.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.479
Well, it would
if my income tax would come.

15:39.720 --> 15:44.077
By the way, do you know
that your dog is wetting the floor?

15:44.320 --> 15:49.314
Yeah, but in his defence,
at least he wasn't aiming for the toilet.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.556
You know, I feel really good
about this biology exam.

15:55.800 --> 15:59.873
I mean, with all this knowledge
of animals, maybe I'll be a veteran.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.558
It's not "veteran."

16:04.800 --> 16:06.950
It's "vegetarian."

16:09.080 --> 16:12.072
God, you're smart.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.675
God, you're wonderful.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.478
I have to go upstairs for a minute.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.597
Daddy, will you entertain
Chad for me?

16:18.840 --> 16:20.876
Certainly, pumpkin.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.636
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Yes, she certainly is.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.474
What do you think
you're doing, Chad?

16:30.880 --> 16:32.677
You missed football practice today.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.478
There was practice today?

16:34.720 --> 16:36.597
Man, time just stops
when I'm with Kelly.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.589
Chad, you do not want Kelly.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.879
From the moment she was conceived
she's ruined men's lives.

16:44.640 --> 16:48.553
All men.
Swaggart, Bakker, Kennedy...

16:49.280 --> 16:51.510
...Kennedy, Kennedy...

16:53.160 --> 16:55.230
...Swaggart again.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.313
- Please don't make me relive this.
- But, Mr. Bundy...

16:58.560 --> 17:00.232
...Kelly is very special to me.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.233
And it's not just a physical thing.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.835
Well, it's mostly physical.

17:06.319 --> 17:07.752
Listen to me, Chad.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.074
You must forget about Kelly
and concentrate on the game.

17:13.319 --> 17:14.799
Chad?

17:17.760 --> 17:19.637
Chad?

17:20.880 --> 17:23.872
If I was younger and didn't
have a 20-pound bonbon in my belly...

17:24.119 --> 17:25.997
...l'd play that game myself.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.231
What game?

17:30.640 --> 17:33.950
- Hi, Chad.
- Hi, Kelly.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.751
I missed you so much.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.433
I'll never leave you again.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.240
Oh, except when I have to go
to the bathroom.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.472
- Oh, Kelly.
- Oh, Chad.

18:04.120 --> 18:07.476
So I'm out $17.34.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.598
So I'll just take it
from the register tomorrow.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.075
Al, you're the greatest.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.880
When I told my bookie
this inside information...

18:17.120 --> 18:20.157
...he bet a hundred grand
of his own money.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.230
Even the jukebox guys are in on it.

18:24.880 --> 18:30.000
With their 500 grand,
my 200 and your $17.34...

18:30.240 --> 18:32.117
...we're gonna make a killing.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.033
You're gonna be a hero, Al.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.555
You're gonna be kibble, Al.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.589
Now, pumpkin, I want you to know
that I'm very fond of Chad...

18:42.840 --> 18:46.310
...and I know that you're very happy
with him...

18:46.640 --> 18:50.110
...but I think maybe it's time
you started seeing other guys.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.875
Daddy, I do see other guys.

18:55.160 --> 18:59.119
They're everywhere. I see them driving,
I see them walking, at the park.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.715
Pumpkin!
That's not what Daddy meant.

19:01.960 --> 19:07.239
I meant, I think it's time you
started to date other guys.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.153
Daddy, I am mature enough
to make my own decisions.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.470
You do anything to stand
between me and Chad...

19:12.680 --> 19:14.796
...I am gonna hold my breast
until I turn blue.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.911
Okay.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.474
Okay, okay.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.952
If Chad is what you want,
I will not stand in your way.

19:26.480 --> 19:31.349
I said if Chad is what you want,
I will not stand in your way.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.515
Well, glory be...

19:40.760 --> 19:44.992
...pumpkin, look,
it's your old boyfriend, Stab Wound.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.949
Hey, Stab,
well, what are you doing here?

19:49.200 --> 19:51.111
Well, you called, and...

19:52.080 --> 19:54.594
How long has it been, Stab?
About five years?

19:54.840 --> 19:58.037
- Three. Good behaviour.
- Come on in here.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.034
Kelly, you remember Stab Wound,
don't you?

20:04.800 --> 20:07.360
Say hello, Kelly.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.916
- Get out.
- Okay.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.675
Well, that was 20 bucks well spent.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.478
All right, look, pumpkin,
I'm gonna level with you.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.517
At tomorrow's game...

20:27.760 --> 20:30.957
...there's gonna be some very powerful
men who will not breathe easy...

20:31.200 --> 20:32.758
...until Chad wins the game.

20:33.880 --> 20:38.237
Well, maybe if they used both nostrils
they'd breathe easier in the first place.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.516
Pumpkin, do you wanna go trolling
in Lake Michigan for your Daddy?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.352
- No.
- All right.

20:45.600 --> 20:48.558
Then you have to make sure
that Chad's team wins.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.633
Understand? Chad's team has to win.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.273
Gin. I win again.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.830
Yeah, this sure beats the hell
out of having sex.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.718
Well, I better get off to the game.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.837
How about a kiss goodbye?

21:04.240 --> 21:08.233
No sugar
until after you win the game.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.637
- Right after?
- Right after.

21:18.880 --> 21:22.190
Man, I'm gonna smoke that team.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.798
Oh, wait, I almost forgot.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.474
I have a good-luck charm for you.
Daddy, is it okay?

21:28.720 --> 21:31.553
- It's fine, pumpkin.
- Oh, good. Come on.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.914
Now, wait here. It's a surprise.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.513
I gotta hand it to you, Al.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.637
Now I'm gonna be able
to prove to Marcie...

21:42.840 --> 21:45.229
...that I am financially responsible.

21:45.480 --> 21:47.391
- Where is Marcie?
- In jail.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.838
She slapped an IRS agent
for not giving her a refund cheque.

21:52.720 --> 21:56.793
- Okay, here it is.
- This is your good-luck charm?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.359
Yeah. His name is Skittles.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.512
And as long as he's near you
nothing bad can happen to you.

22:01.760 --> 22:02.988
Here.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.829
Wait...

22:06.040 --> 22:07.678
...the pig is my good-luck charm.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.150
That's my evil giraffe, Gonzar!

22:13.360 --> 22:16.158
Chad! Chad!

22:16.400 --> 22:19.437
- Say something, Chad!
- I think I broke my arm.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.955
Say something else.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.191
I know I broke my arm.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.556
Al! The bet!

22:26.800 --> 22:29.030
What are we gonna do?

22:35.760 --> 22:38.672
And that's the final score.
The Tremaine Jacksons. 56.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.673
The Sonora Screaming
Desert Tortoises. 3.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.390
We did it! We did it! I'm rich.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.279
How about that performance
from the Windy City Condoms'...

22:48.480 --> 22:51.392
...player of the game,
the quarterback, Chad Dowling?

22:52.840 --> 22:55.115
Chad, come on over here, buddy.
Let me talk to you.

22:55.840 --> 23:00.277
Now, you threw for five touchdown
passes, you ran for two more...

23:00.520 --> 23:02.238
...you set a new collegiate record.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.994
Tell me, what are you gonna do now?
- Well...

23:05.240 --> 23:07.800
...l'm going to Disneyland.

23:08.305 --> 23:14.342
