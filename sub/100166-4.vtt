It's D.J. Can you dig it?

Oh, I can dig it.

Ooh.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.500
Oh, no.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.376
Are you two digging each other again?

01:27.337 --> 01:31.508
Hey. Your outfit for Moms' Night Out
better be in that laundry basket.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.260
Deej, I can't go.

01:34.344 --> 01:38.098
What? No, we made a plan.
Tonight, we are getting our freak on.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.226
Yeah, that's right. I said, "Freak on."

01:42.060 --> 01:43.520
At Club Euphoria.

01:43.603 --> 01:48.191
It's where the She-Wolf pack started,
and site of one of our greatest triumphs.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.153
Yeah, Grammy-winner Macy Gray
mistook us for lesbians.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.282
Well, not just lesbians. Dancing lesbians.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.493
Yeah, we won a contest.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.912
For dancing, not being lesbians.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.250
I was there, and it was great,

02:05.333 --> 02:08.086
but now I have a baby
and laundry to do.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.629

02:11.339 --> 02:14.008
Oh, Mylanta. How could you say-- Ahh.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.638

Hello, Deej.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.359
Hello, Gia. It's really great to see you.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.112
Oh, that did not come across
as sarcastic as I was hoping.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.156
[door closes]

02:36.239 --> 02:38.700
Hi, Jackson's mom.
I'm gonna go talk to Ramona.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.619
Mm. Don't be impolite.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.372
Ask Rocki if she'd like a beverage.

02:46.374 --> 02:50.378
Sorry to interrupt, D.J.,
but... Gia and I need a little favor.

02:50.461 --> 02:53.756
Here it comes.
They want you to dispose of a body.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.928
When you have an SUV,
people always want you to move things.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.016
No. We need a document notarized.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.060
Oh. D.J. Fuller, Notary Public,
at your service.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.898
So, what'd you do with the body?

03:12.150 --> 03:13.193
There's no body.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.695
Ah, got it.
[clicks tongue]

03:17.697 --> 03:18.948
You guys are good.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.911
You are in luck.
I just got a brand-new notary stamp,

03:22.994 --> 03:25.538
and I have been dying to take this baby
out for a spin.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.791
Just when I think
you weren't dorky enough,

03:28.875 --> 03:30.752
now I find out you're a notary public?

03:32.128 --> 03:36.216
It is so sad how women
put down other women in power.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.385
You stamp a piece of paper.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.598
I am an official of
the State of California. I took an oath.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.725
Did you? I didn't think so.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.647
So what needs notarizing?
Promissory note? Bank form?

03:50.730 --> 03:53.149
I know this is kind of a weird way
to break the news,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.401
but... a marriage license.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.486
We got married!

03:57.695 --> 03:58.696
To who?

04:01.449 --> 04:04.911
Oh, wow! Congratulations.

04:04.994 --> 04:08.081
That was a really fast engagement.
Like... uh, none.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.626
Well, interesting story.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.128
Lil' Bun and I are in Vegas,
and we thought,

04:14.212 --> 04:16.756
"We love each other.
Why not get married?"

04:19.050 --> 04:20.593
So what's the interesting part?

04:22.720 --> 04:25.348
Well, good for you.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.934
What is this, your third marriage?

04:28.017 --> 04:29.978
-Fourth.
-Fourth! Ahem.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.189
Oh, look at you two.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.942
Learning new stuff
about each other every day.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.114
Well, they do say
fourth time is the charm.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.908
[chuckles] Not often, but I've heard it.

04:46.828 --> 04:50.665
Your mom ran off and married Matt in Vegas
while you were at volleyball camp?

04:50.748 --> 04:53.543
I thought the most embarrassing thing
they were gonna do in Vegas

04:53.626 --> 04:54.711
is go see Carrot Top.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.880
Which they also did.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.009
Oof. Prop comics.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.302
[Rocki] Mm.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.763
So, now I'm on to stepdad number three.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.433
I don't even bother to learn
their last names anymore.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.726
Really?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.186
On second thought, maybe I should

05:12.270 --> 05:15.106
so I can forge his signature
to get out of detention.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.858
[both laugh]

05:16.941 --> 05:18.818
My parents have been engaged so long,

05:18.901 --> 05:21.696
five of my favorite shows
have been canceled and rebooted.

05:23.281 --> 05:26.159
Hey, Ramo-- Oh.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.618
Rocki.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.078
What's up, Fuller?

05:29.162 --> 05:32.081
What's up is I haven't seen you
since the hospital,

05:32.165 --> 05:35.043
where you held my hand
and then never called me.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.129
Call you? Why?

05:39.547 --> 05:43.384
Wait. You didn't think that meant
we were back together, did you?

05:43.468 --> 05:45.345
No-o-o-o-o.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.929

05:47.013 --> 05:49.015
[coughs] I'm parched.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.436
[coughs]

05:55.605 --> 05:58.316
I was worried
<i>you</i> thought we were back together.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.695
Because of one stupid handhold?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.697
-Right? Heh.
-Hmm.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.575
-Now that we're back to being broken up--
-We were never not.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.496
Okay, good.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.207
Glad we got that straightened out.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.543
You know, I'm-I'm parched, too.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.545
[laughs and coughs]

06:22.673 --> 06:24.759
This is wonderful news!

06:25.426 --> 06:27.428
The lovebirds
have made their nest official.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.183
Actually, my girlfriend made it official.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.268
That's her notary stamp right there.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.022
You know what that notary stamp
does to me.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.692
Just wait until
I take your thumbprint, sailor.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.446
All right, before I change my mind,

06:45.530 --> 06:47.573

Oh, you guys are doing Mom's Night Out?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.828
Gia, you should go with them.

06:52.453 --> 06:56.582
Hmm. Sounds like a fun place
for my bridal shower you never threw me.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.294
Oh, Matt, look at you,

07:00.378 --> 07:03.172

and suggesting she come out with us.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.133
You are just full of great decisions.

[stammers] You guys got married?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.472
Wow, how long did I take to get dressed?

07:12.932 --> 07:15.685
You stop to shave your legs,
you miss a lot of drama.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.187
I can stick around here.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.274
It'll give me a chance to bond with Rocki,
who is my stepdaughter.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.026
Wow, I have a stepdaughter.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.654

07:32.743 --> 07:34.537
All right. Baby monitor.

-Don't wait up.

Thank you guys so much
for watching the baby.

-Don't worry about it. Be safe.
-See you later.

07:41.335 --> 07:44.505
It does not seem fair that the ladies
get to shake their groove things

07:44.589 --> 07:46.591
while our groove things remain unshaken.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.720

Matt should, too.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.239
Oh, hey, Rocki.

Um, your mom just went out,
but if you don't mind hanging here a bit,

08:14.160 --> 08:17.371
it might give you and I
a chance to get to know each other better.

08:17.455 --> 08:21.417
Great. Nothing like an awkward night
with my ex-boyfriend

08:21.501 --> 08:23.377
