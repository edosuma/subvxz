00:15.738 --> 00:19.042
Um, yeah, so I got
an early start.

00:19.044 --> 00:22.015
I was 10 years old.

00:22.017 --> 00:24.452
We had just moved
into this new house.

00:24.454 --> 00:27.058
I was really excited
because it had two stories,

00:27.060 --> 00:28.795
instead of one story.

00:28.797 --> 00:30.699
I thought that meant
we made it.

00:30.701 --> 00:33.505
And so we also had a staircase,
which had a banister,

00:33.507 --> 00:35.842
and like how great
would it be

00:35.844 --> 00:37.979
to like just slide
down the banister.

00:37.981 --> 00:41.821
I realized that it was
really, really great.

00:41.823 --> 00:43.792
What was even better was, like,

00:43.794 --> 00:46.096
once you slid down
to the bottom,

00:46.098 --> 00:50.672
inching your way back up
the top was really good.

00:50.674 --> 00:54.412
Many followed
with multiple partners,

00:54.414 --> 00:58.353
but I never had multiples
until I met Lu.

00:58.355 --> 01:01.661
Sex with her was just
so amazing

01:01.663 --> 01:04.866
in this way
that wasn't just physical.

01:04.867 --> 01:08.406
But then just to be
so surprised

01:08.408 --> 01:12.482
that my body could like
have the capacity

01:12.484 --> 01:15.455
for this thing that I thought
I'm a total pro at.

01:15.457 --> 01:20.565
Well, I mean, there were,
I guess, powers unleashed within

01:20.567 --> 01:22.602

even know I had.

that just...

a really tough day,

to say. I think, like...

21:57.437 --> 22:00.207
Technically... You can have it.
I was working on it.

22:00.209 --> 22:01.578
But I guess, technically,

22:01.580 --> 22:04.551
I'm kind of the best man
or whatever.

22:04.553 --> 22:07.055
- The only man.
- The only man at the table.

22:07.057 --> 22:09.560
We may as well change
the terminology to "only man."

22:09.562 --> 22:13.234
Andi has been,
as you probably all know,

22:13.236 --> 22:16.440
has been my best friend
for my whole life, basically.

22:16.442 --> 22:19.483
We've seen each other
at our best and worst.

22:20.515 --> 22:21.383
I've had so many ups and downs
over the years,

22:21.385 --> 22:25.325
and I know that you've had
mostly ups, you know?

22:25.327 --> 22:27.194
And very few downs.

22:27.196 --> 22:30.267
The only downs
I really can think of

22:30.269 --> 22:35.077
is when you guys broke up,
and you were a miserable...

22:35.079 --> 22:39.352
like she absolutely was like
the worst I've ever seen her.

22:39.354 --> 22:41.122
And so I just thought, like,

22:41.124 --> 22:44.631
all right, I guess... if it
was causing her so much trauma,

22:44.633 --> 22:46.299
maybe it wasn't right
or whatever.

22:46.301 --> 22:48.070

at these things.

that you guys belong together,

- Yes!

35:17.203 --> 35:20.140
and I was like
leaning over the edge,

35:20.142 --> 35:23.245
and the jet hit me
at just the right angle,

35:23.247 --> 35:25.918
and then I was like, "Oh!"

35:25.920 --> 35:28.591
Two seconds later,
you know, it happened!

35:28.593 --> 35:30.528
I blurted out
in front of everyone.

35:30.530 --> 35:32.865
"You guys,
the jet just hit my vagina,

35:32.867 --> 35:34.702
and it felt really good!"

35:34.704 --> 35:38.209
And this older girl,
the cold sore girl,

35:38.211 --> 35:42.150
she started laughing at me,

35:42.152 --> 35:46.993
and no one had ever
laughed at me like that before.

35:46.995 --> 35:50.000
And I just froze,

35:50.002 --> 35:53.273
and I was fucking terrified
of the hot tub.

35:53.275 --> 35:57.047
I didn't step foot in it
for the rest of the summer.

35:57.049 --> 35:58.884
I think it's important
to mention

35:58.886 --> 36:01.789
we were not taught
the word "vagina."

36:01.791 --> 36:04.161
I definitely didn't
say it that day.

36:04.163 --> 36:07.300
We were told
it was called a "missy."

36:07.302 --> 36:11.609
And I definitely knew
the word "penis."

36:11.611 --> 36:14.782
So I don't know why my family,
like, you know,

36:14.784 --> 36:18.155
taught us male anatomy
but not female.

36:18.157 --> 36:21.062
Well, I guess I could guess,
right?

36:21.064 --> 36:23.601
It's so... What the fuck?
Missy?

36:23.603 --> 36:25.541
That's so fucked up.

that she's married?

36:57.201 --> 37:01.111
She just told me
that she's getting a divorce.

37:02.212 --> 37:03.746
A divorce.

37:03.748 --> 37:06.351
Well, I asked,
"You're married, right?"

37:06.353 --> 37:08.891
And she just... Yeah.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.362
She's just so selfish.

37:11.364 --> 37:15.302
I mean, this was supposed to be
nice for us, this weekend.

Yes, I do.

37:20.816 --> 37:23.886
I believe in telling her
everything.

37:23.888 --> 37:28.228
It's that Josh always
has to fuck everything,

my sister-in-law.

my aunt's romance novels.

38:18.865 --> 38:21.502
But she was like always
in and out of rehab.

38:21.504 --> 38:23.507
So my grandma had all these
romance novels in her house,

38:23.509 --> 38:26.178
and I was spending the summer
with her, after my mom died.

38:26.180 --> 38:28.216
And like she would go to work,

38:28.218 --> 38:29.919
and I had all these books
around the house,

38:29.921 --> 38:31.422
and then I started reading.

38:31.424 --> 38:33.125
She was like,
"Don't go in your aunt's room!"

38:33.127 --> 38:34.962
I was curious.
What's in my aunt's room?

38:34.964 --> 38:37.534
She had this huge library of
books and ashtrays everywhere.

38:37.536 --> 38:41.341
But I found this book and said,
"This is a cool cover."

38:41.343 --> 38:43.144
I just remember reading
about this man,

38:43.146 --> 38:45.249
and he had like this
throbbing thing in his jeans.

38:45.251 --> 38:47.320
And I was like,
"What about my throb spot?"

38:47.322 --> 38:49.358
'Cause I started feeling weird
in my pants.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.895

Then I started touching
where my zipper was,

"How come I don't have that?

38:54.937 --> 38:56.538
What's going on?"

38:56.540 --> 38:58.342
Then I put my hand
a little lower,

38:58.344 --> 38:59.645

"That's my throbber.

39:11.470 --> 39:14.441
Like really feeling
my throb spot,

39:14.443 --> 39:17.514
and just went to town all
afternoon in my grandma's bed.

39:17.516 --> 39:19.251

at the time.

39:19.253 --> 39:21.723

I disrespected my grandma.

we had health,

39:24.229 --> 39:26.131

puberty and stuff,

being in that dog's skin

- Oh, it's okay.
- Thank you so much.

46:13.212 --> 46:14.447
Let's just do it later.

46:14.449 --> 46:16.451
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

46:16.453 --> 46:18.088
I feel really bad
about the come thing

46:18.090 --> 46:20.324
because I didn't know,
and I blacked out.

46:20.326 --> 46:22.530
- And I'm really sorry.
- Helen?

46:22.532 --> 46:24.934
- I really didn't mean it, Andi.
- It's fine.

46:24.936 --> 46:27.306
I felt bad,
so I'm really sorry.

46:27.308 --> 46:29.277
- It's all good.
- Okay.

46:29.279 --> 46:31.447
And I also left my van
at the bar,

46:31.449 --> 46:33.250
so we need to get it
and I was wondering

46:33.252 --> 46:35.490
maybe if you wanna ride,
kinda get out of here...

46:35.492 --> 46:38.128
I would love to get the fuck outta here.
I'm gonna go, okay?

46:38.130 --> 46:39.831
- Okay, I love you.
- Love you.

46:39.833 --> 46:41.334
I love you guys too.

46:41.336 --> 46:43.040
Okay. It's okay.

46:51.089 --> 46:53.626
You know what, he's like
a really good dad.

46:53.628 --> 46:56.133
He's really good to you.

46:57.902 --> 46:59.169
Yeah.

46:59.171 --> 47:01.341
What did you do?

47:01.343 --> 47:05.249
I'd rather not talk about it
right in this very moment.

47:05.251 --> 47:08.254
Okay, or ever, like...

47:08.256 --> 47:10.993
No, I just don't,
you know.

47:10.995 --> 47:12.631
I just...

47:12.633 --> 47:14.436
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

47:16.038 --> 47:17.507
This the first time up here?

47:17.509 --> 47:20.177
Oh, yeah, for me,
for sure, yeah.

47:20.179 --> 47:22.149
[Driver]
How you liking it?

47:22.151 --> 47:25.455
I'm having a great time.
They're...

47:25.457 --> 47:27.526
Honestly, Doug,
it's been really rough.

47:27.528 --> 47:29.297
It's just really tense.

47:29.299 --> 47:32.336
We're up here for a bachelorette
weekend, and it just...

47:32.338 --> 47:34.273
Things just kinda blew up.

47:34.275 --> 47:37.514
Well, there's a lot to do.
It's quiet, obviously.

47:37.516 --> 47:40.252
- How long you gonna stay for?
- The weekend.

47:40.254 --> 47:41.955
Okay, cool.

47:41.957 --> 47:44.060
I'm a sleep-eater.

47:44.062 --> 47:47.333
- I'm sorry, what?
- What do you mean?

47:47.335 --> 47:50.238
It's kind of like
sleepwalking, but...

47:50.240 --> 47:52.309
instead of just walking,

47:52.311 --> 47:56.117
I walk to the kitchen,
and I prepare food.

47:56.119 --> 47:58.689
- Like actual meals?
- No, no.

47:58.691 --> 48:00.459
Probably the weirdest thing
I ever made

48:00.461 --> 48:03.665
was I retiled
our entire kitchen

48:03.667 --> 48:05.669
out of different
colored cookies.

48:05.671 --> 48:08.307
Oh, cool. That's cool.

48:08.309 --> 48:10.412
I made a big mosaic pattern
everywhere.

48:10.414 --> 48:13.452
Apparently I took the cookie,
got butter, spread it on there,

48:13.454 --> 48:15.590
got a fork with the ridges,
made little ridges in there,

48:15.592 --> 48:17.392
stuck it right on.

48:17.394 --> 48:21.233
I used to be a stone mason,
so it comes naturally to me.

48:21.235 --> 48:23.304
- Like artwork?
- Yeah!

48:23.306 --> 48:25.242
Sometimes I eat it,
sometimes I leave it.

48:25.244 --> 48:27.179
It's really beautiful
how the mind works.

48:27.181 --> 48:29.718
That's your subconscious
just really emitting

48:29.720 --> 48:31.454
through the physical world.

48:31.456 --> 48:35.630
I think that inside
I'm like this struggling artist,

48:35.632 --> 48:38.501
and it wants to come out
at night.

48:38.503 --> 48:40.439
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
or something.

48:40.441 --> 48:42.610
I would love to see
like a blog of this.

48:42.612 --> 48:44.780
Do you have like a...
was is it, a portfolio?

48:44.782 --> 48:48.556
- I've actually got a site.
- What?

48:48.558 --> 48:50.191
I'll send you a link.

48:50.193 --> 48:52.863
Okay. I mean,
you guys aren't talking.

48:52.865 --> 48:56.404
- I have a headache.
- Lu, it's all about you.

48:56.406 --> 48:58.608
- Oh, my God.
- Well, you know what?

48:58.610 --> 49:02.348
- Come on. This is... come on.
- All right, I'm sorry.

49:02.350 --> 49:05.490
There's a lot of tension.

49:05.492 --> 49:07.125
- Thanks, Doug, yeah.
- You're welcome.

49:07.127 --> 49:08.360
Thank you guys.

49:08.362 --> 49:09.764
Great to meet you, dude.

49:09.766 --> 49:11.735
[Doug] Do that survey.
Could you, please?

49:11.737 --> 49:13.270
Yeah, five stars
all the way, dude.

49:13.272 --> 49:14.774
I really appreciate it,
you guys.

49:14.776 --> 49:16.577
[Helen] Let me know if you
wanna hang out sometime.

49:16.579 --> 49:18.652
- Definitely! Take care.
- Bye.

49:19.819 --> 49:22.657
That guy was all right.

49:22.659 --> 49:26.598
I'll say that I don't recall
my first orgasm.

49:26.600 --> 49:29.737
Just doesn't... I don't know.
I have no idea, no answer.

49:29.739 --> 49:31.842
Just probably
could have been anything.

49:31.844 --> 49:35.347
Probably was masturbating
or something like that.

49:35.349 --> 49:39.823
I do recall that Andi
became sexually active

49:39.825 --> 49:42.229
much earlier than me.

49:42.231 --> 49:44.868
I was a late bloomer
on all fronts,

49:44.870 --> 49:48.808
and she would kind of divulge
every little detail.

49:48.810 --> 49:51.614
I remember taking note

49:51.616 --> 49:56.892
and remembering...
those stories.

49:56.894 --> 49:58.996
You know what I'm saying?
Remembering.

49:58.998 --> 50:02.236
She might see a girl's boobs,

50:02.238 --> 50:04.940
and a girl
might also see hers.

50:04.942 --> 50:07.981
That's all it really took
back then was hearing something,

50:07.983 --> 50:11.319
and to be honest,
that's all it really takes now.

50:11.321 --> 50:12.990
I hope my mom
doesn't see this.

50:12.992 --> 50:14.860
Whatever. I don't care
if she sees it.

50:14.862 --> 50:16.530
I don't know why
you would fuck her

50:16.532 --> 50:18.433
when I'm just getting
tons of text messages

50:18.435 --> 50:20.472
about how fucking annoyed
you are with her.

50:20.474 --> 50:21.874
Like is that the solution,

50:21.876 --> 50:24.280
just putting your dick in her
to shut her up?

50:24.282 --> 50:26.518
I was wrong.

50:26.520 --> 50:28.353
She's a nice person.

50:28.355 --> 50:29.690
She's going through
a rough time.

50:29.692 --> 50:31.327
Everybody is a nice person.

50:31.329 --> 50:32.664
Everybody is going through
a rough time.

50:32.666 --> 50:34.433
- Is everybody?
- Yes!

50:34.435 --> 50:38.073
Actually I do think
most people are not bad people.

50:38.075 --> 50:39.644
They just do shitty things,

50:39.646 --> 50:42.416
like having sex
with their best friend's

50:42.418 --> 50:43.619
future sister-in-law.

50:43.621 --> 50:46.857
I thought
that she was divorced.

50:46.859 --> 50:48.729
Or getting a divorce.

50:48.731 --> 50:50.899
And I thought you knew.

50:50.901 --> 50:52.570
Well, we didn't know.

50:52.572 --> 50:53.906
That's not my fault.

50:53.908 --> 50:55.910
No, actually,
it's not your fault.

50:55.912 --> 50:57.913
Maybe communication
was just bad.

50:57.915 --> 50:59.917
Speaking of which, why are you
taking everything out on me?

50:59.919 --> 51:02.522
Why is communication so bad
with you in your relationship?

51:02.524 --> 51:05.395
You made it seem like you guys
had this open thing going on.

51:05.397 --> 51:07.770
Were you totally
unaware of this?

51:10.874 --> 51:11.908
Yeah.

51:11.910 --> 51:13.678
You had no idea?

51:13.680 --> 51:15.582
She was faking it, right?

51:15.584 --> 51:17.418
What am I supposed to do about
the fact that she's faking it?

51:17.420 --> 51:19.457
I don't know.

51:19.459 --> 51:21.660
I mean, maybe there's another
angle to look at, you know?

51:21.662 --> 51:25.033
Are you a dead fish
in the bed?

51:25.035 --> 51:27.974
How dare you accuse me
of being a dead fish?

51:27.976 --> 51:29.911
You're always bragging,
talking a big game.

51:29.913 --> 51:32.784
That's 'cause I am
the liveliest fish you ever met.

51:32.786 --> 51:34.152
I'm splashing
all over the place.

51:34.154 --> 51:35.922
I don't know why
she didn't tell me.

51:35.924 --> 51:37.459
- Maybe it's not her fault.
- But she didn't tell me.

51:37.461 --> 51:38.929
What, it's my fault?

51:38.931 --> 51:41.838
Maybe.
You never considered that?

51:43.541 --> 51:46.443
Uh, well, tell me
how it would be my fault

51:46.445 --> 51:49.884
if she did not tell me
something that I did not know.

51:49.886 --> 51:52.121
Uh, let me put it this way.

51:52.123 --> 51:55.763
You seem to not be aware
of everything going on,

51:55.765 --> 51:57.600
except for what's easiest
for you.

51:57.602 --> 51:59.036
What are you talking about?

51:59.038 --> 52:02.209
Whether you have always
chosen to ignore it

52:02.211 --> 52:04.580
or you're just
completely oblivious,

52:04.582 --> 52:06.785
I don't know.

52:06.787 --> 52:10.158
But you seem to have
zero awareness

52:10.160 --> 52:12.597
that I've just been
in love with you

52:12.599 --> 52:14.900
for like the last 30 years.

52:14.902 --> 52:16.035
Oh, my God.

52:16.037 --> 52:19.009
Are you really gonna...

52:19.011 --> 52:21.246
Josh! Fuck you!

52:21.248 --> 52:24.286
Do not push this shit on me now!
I'm getting married!

52:24.288 --> 52:26.624
I'm not trying to woo you
or steal you away.

52:26.626 --> 52:27.993
I'm trying to prove a point.

52:27.995 --> 52:30.932
- What are you even...
- You have no idea.

52:30.934 --> 52:33.571
You ignore whatever's
in front of you

52:33.573 --> 52:36.578
and just take what's
most convenient for you.

52:36.580 --> 52:40.050
And I'm telling you,
as a best friend,

52:40.052 --> 52:43.223
not as a "you suck."

52:43.225 --> 52:44.861
You understand
what I'm saying?

52:44.863 --> 52:46.631
I haven't been trying
to mock you.

52:46.633 --> 52:48.134
I haven't been trying
to make fun of you.

52:48.136 --> 52:50.838
I'm trying to tell you
that this is something,

52:50.840 --> 52:53.814
I'm not positive,
but to consider.

52:57.187 --> 53:01.029
[children giggling]

53:04.769 --> 53:06.270
You're pulling my hair.

53:06.272 --> 53:09.844
- No! No hair pulling.
- Don't pull her hair!

53:09.846 --> 53:13.016
Hey, you guys,
I think we gotta get going.

53:13.018 --> 53:14.920
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:14.922 --> 53:17.324
- Okay, but we miss you.
- Miss you.

53:17.326 --> 53:18.995
Bye. I miss you too.

53:18.997 --> 53:20.130
Aww.

53:20.132 --> 53:22.836
- Bye.
- Bye.

53:22.838 --> 53:24.139
I love you guys.

53:24.141 --> 53:26.176
Hey, Frankie,
can you give me a call

53:26.178 --> 53:28.682
before you go to bed
tonight?

53:28.684 --> 53:30.018
Yeah.

53:30.020 --> 53:32.258
Okay, love you.
Kisses!

53:35.397 --> 53:36.767
Bye!

53:38.302 --> 53:40.371
Okay.

53:40.373 --> 53:43.010
- Okay.
- They're okay.

53:43.012 --> 53:46.286
Yeah, yeah,
that made me feel better.

53:50.325 --> 53:52.462
[ Helen] Hey, you guys
ready to go back?

53:52.464 --> 53:54.967
Or you guys down to clown?

53:54.969 --> 53:57.807
- Can we not?
- I think we need to take a beat.

53:57.809 --> 54:00.277
I just need some space.

54:00.279 --> 54:04.085
All right.
I got something I can give ya.

54:04.087 --> 54:06.390
The Vengabus
is down to party, huh?

54:06.392 --> 54:08.728
I got you something special
for this bachelorette weekend.

54:08.730 --> 54:10.230
Oh, my God.
Please say that's weed.

54:10.232 --> 54:12.167
- Yeah, it's weed.
- Oh, my God, yes!

54:12.169 --> 54:13.738
Look at this!

54:13.740 --> 54:15.809
Like King Tut, baby.

54:15.811 --> 54:18.482
- Like for real.
- What is this made out of?

54:18.484 --> 54:20.752
- It's real gold, man.
- I'm just kidding.

54:20.754 --> 54:22.823
You can touch that.
You can smoke it.

54:22.825 --> 54:25.294
These are like a 24 karat.

54:25.296 --> 54:26.798
You're really thoughtful.

54:26.800 --> 54:29.537
You brought us
like Molly and stuff.

54:29.539 --> 54:32.075
- Just like a good mom does.
- [laughter]

54:32.077 --> 54:35.380
I didn't mean it like that.
That's like, uh...

54:35.382 --> 54:38.186
"Don't forget your lunchbox.
Don't forget the Molly."

54:38.188 --> 54:40.459
Like, I should've brought that.

54:40.461 --> 54:42.328
Does it taste weird?

54:42.330 --> 54:45.066
I think gold
burns your throat.

54:45.068 --> 54:47.373
- Oh, shit!
- It's gonna burn a little bit.

54:48.811 --> 54:51.548
[knocking]

54:51.550 --> 54:53.152
Yeah?

55:00.968 --> 55:03.303
Hey, sweetcakes.

55:03.305 --> 55:05.340
Hey, Andi.

55:05.342 --> 55:06.911
What ya doin'?

55:06.913 --> 55:09.282
This feels
like an intervention.

55:09.284 --> 55:13.156
No, we love you,
and we miss you.

55:13.158 --> 55:15.595
That makes it feel
more like an intervention.

55:15.597 --> 55:18.501
Dude, I haven't seen you
in like 10 months.

55:18.503 --> 55:20.972
I know. It's true. Hug.

55:20.974 --> 55:22.575
I was gonna give this
to you at brunch,

55:22.577 --> 55:26.383
but it didn't seem to be
an appropriate time.

55:26.385 --> 55:28.554
The latest issue of The
Adventures of Kitty and Pup.

55:28.556 --> 55:31.660
It's a special bachelorette
edition Kitty and Pups.

55:31.662 --> 55:33.465
Okay, tell me a story
of Kitty and Pup.

55:33.467 --> 55:36.269
Here's what it's about.
Twenty years in the making.

55:36.271 --> 55:38.675
Here, you see Pup is saying,
"I'm hungry."

55:38.677 --> 55:41.513
- Can you believe it?
- [Andi] He's always hungry.

55:41.515 --> 55:43.984
Yeah, and Kitty's like,
"How about tuna?"

55:43.986 --> 55:45.253
And he goes, "Oh, okay."

55:45.255 --> 55:46.523
Then there's
a tuna fish there,

55:46.525 --> 55:48.460
and it says,
"I'm dead. Eat me."

for the first time,

he like lifted off me
and was like, "Oh, my God!

like go for it like that."

01:19:09.427 --> 01:19:14.001
You're right. It was not
your place to make it.

01:19:14.003 --> 01:19:15.371
I feel great now.

01:19:15.373 --> 01:19:18.376
We can get this weekend
back on track.

01:19:18.378 --> 01:19:21.852
Yeah, we pushed those problems
right through.

01:19:21.854 --> 01:19:25.190
Yeah, now they're just like
face to face.

01:19:25.192 --> 01:19:29.032
- You're welcome.
- [laughs]

01:19:29.034 --> 01:19:31.169
Happy weekend!

01:19:31.171 --> 01:19:33.876
Happy weekend.

01:19:33.878 --> 01:19:38.886
Yeah, maybe bad timing,
but I don't know.

01:19:38.888 --> 01:19:42.560
It's better than like,
much later, I guess.

01:19:42.562 --> 01:19:45.430
They have no idea
what we're talking about.

01:19:45.432 --> 01:19:48.806
They're in the zone.
They can't hear me.

01:19:48.808 --> 01:19:50.475
[laughing]

01:19:50.477 --> 01:19:53.449
I don't know
where the fuck I am.

01:19:55.855 --> 01:19:57.155
Hey, babe.

01:19:57.157 --> 01:19:58.858
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:01.031
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.971
Hi.

01:20:04.973 --> 01:20:07.209
Well, what did I miss?

01:20:07.211 --> 01:20:08.578
I don't know.

01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.614
Nothing.

01:20:09.616 --> 01:20:11.518
How you doing?

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.523
Better.

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:17.563
- What?
- Is someone here?

01:20:17.565 --> 01:20:19.870
Someone order a pizza?

01:20:21.404 --> 01:20:23.276
What? No.

01:20:28.653 --> 01:20:30.388
Oh, hey, Doug!

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:31.594
- What's up?
- Hey, somebody invited Doug.

01:20:35.065 --> 01:20:38.004
Where are you going?

01:20:38.006 --> 01:20:40.308
Listen, um...

01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:43.046
I'm very sorry.

01:20:43.048 --> 01:20:49.059
I just spent the last
20 minutes up in the room,

01:20:49.061 --> 01:20:50.628
thinking about things,

01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:53.601
and I don't know
how to fix this.

01:20:53.603 --> 01:20:57.542
Um, obviously,
I'm selfish.

01:20:57.544 --> 01:20:59.312
I'm a total asshole.

01:20:59.314 --> 01:21:01.383
I don't make you feel safe.

01:21:01.385 --> 01:21:05.258
I kind of feel like the real
big problem right now is me.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.429
And so, yeah,
I think that I should go.

01:21:07.431 --> 01:21:09.066
No! No!

01:21:09.068 --> 01:21:11.503
No, I love you,
you love me.

01:21:11.505 --> 01:21:14.743
We're in this together.
You're not going anywhere, okay?

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:19.419
If I can't make you feel good,
why do you even love me?

01:21:19.421 --> 01:21:21.991
Shut up! Listen!
I'm talking to you, okay?

01:21:21.993 --> 01:21:23.227
We don't need to fix it.

01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:24.697
We don't need to fix it
right now.

01:21:24.699 --> 01:21:26.567
We're gonna work it out,
okay?

01:21:26.569 --> 01:21:29.439
Yes, you're a bitch, okay?

01:21:29.441 --> 01:21:30.709
You're a fucking bitch,

01:21:30.711 --> 01:21:32.411
and we're gonna
get fucking married

01:21:32.413 --> 01:21:34.683
and have the rest of our lives
to figure this shit out.

01:21:34.685 --> 01:21:36.419
We're gonna have kids,
and they're gonna have problems,

01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:40.194
and we're gonna be there
for them too, okay?

01:21:40.196 --> 01:21:42.264
This is just
one speed bump in life,

01:21:42.266 --> 01:21:44.603
and we're gonna have
so many more,

01:21:44.605 --> 01:21:47.442
and they're gonna be about
more than just orgasms, okay?

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:50.415
And trust, they're gonna be
about... I don't even know!

01:21:50.417 --> 01:21:52.619
Fucking, our dog dying,
or I don't know.

01:21:52.621 --> 01:21:55.425
- You want us to have a dog?
- We're gonna get a dog!

01:21:55.427 --> 01:21:57.127
We're gonna talk
about that, okay?

01:21:57.129 --> 01:21:59.635
I really want one,
a medium-sized one, all right?

01:22:02.475 --> 01:22:06.346
I promise this is nothing,
and we...

01:22:06.348 --> 01:22:08.454
we're it.

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:15.097
Please, just...

01:22:15.099 --> 01:22:16.701
I love you so much.

01:22:16.703 --> 01:22:18.474
[sobbing]

01:22:19.576 --> 01:22:20.677
[laughs]

01:22:25.654 --> 01:22:28.491
- I'm so snotty.
- Yeah, you are.

01:22:28.493 --> 01:22:32.164
I never saw you
like that before.

01:22:32.166 --> 01:22:33.535
Do you like it?

01:22:33.537 --> 01:22:35.706
Can you hear me now?
I'm talking!

01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:38.413
I'm telling you how I feel!

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:48.465
[laughs]

01:22:48.467 --> 01:22:50.505
This is cool.
[laughing]

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.610
This is not
how I usually am.

01:22:54.612 --> 01:22:56.445
I like that side of you,
Andi.

01:22:56.447 --> 01:22:59.820
It's really cool to see you
open up like that with us.

01:22:59.822 --> 01:23:03.226
This is the side of me
that you guys like?

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:05.464
- It's the softer side.
- You guys are all fucking assholes.

01:23:05.466 --> 01:23:06.634
Now show me your tits.

01:23:06.636 --> 01:23:07.936
We love it!

01:23:07.938 --> 01:23:09.639
Oh, no!
I forgot about that part.

01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:11.880
Is this appropriate anymore?

01:23:15.486 --> 01:23:19.527
Yeah, I thought
when I admitted it,

01:23:19.529 --> 01:23:23.667
it would be the worst thing
in the world.

01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:26.841
I just...
It just was, I don't know.

01:23:26.843 --> 01:23:30.548
I just was so scared
of that moment.

01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:33.320
But it wasn't that bad.

01:23:33.322 --> 01:23:37.595
It's actually better now
because there's honesty,

01:23:37.597 --> 01:23:41.903
and there's also
this potential world

01:23:41.905 --> 01:23:45.911
that we haven't
even discovered yet.

01:23:45.913 --> 01:23:47.483
I haven't.

01:23:47.485 --> 01:23:52.793
Um, my first orgasm
is still TBD.

01:23:52.795 --> 01:23:54.897
But it hasn't happened yet.

01:23:54.899 --> 01:23:56.801
Hasn't happened yet!

01:23:56.803 --> 01:23:57.836
[laughs]

01:23:57.838 --> 01:23:59.473
And that's all good.

01:23:59.475 --> 01:24:01.577
And yeah, everyone's
just waiting, you know.

01:24:01.579 --> 01:24:03.982
No pressure. Just...

01:24:03.984 --> 01:24:06.753
I'll let everybody know
the updates.

01:24:06.755 --> 01:24:09.460
[laughing]

01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:10.898
Um, and, yeah.
