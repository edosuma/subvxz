- That's a dominant gene.

03:43.806 --> 03:44.766
You have green eyes.

03:44.849 --> 03:45.850
- Green eyes.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.101

09:05.503 --> 09:07.463
- Oh, hey, I think the
kid's starting to wake up.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.217
- Wh--where am I?

09:11.300 --> 09:12.593
- We're at Mystic Beach.

09:15.179 --> 09:18.391
- Where is everybody?

09:18.474 --> 09:20.184
- We're trying to
figure that out.

09:20.268 --> 09:20.977
- Are you sure you gave
the

09:21.060 --> 09:22.645
cab driver the right directions?

09:22.728 --> 09:23.980
- Yes. I googled it.

09:24.063 --> 09:24.772
Mystic Beach is exactly

09:24.855 --> 09:27.108
57 miles north
of PCA.

09:27.191 --> 09:27.942
- No, it's not.

09:28.025 --> 09:31.279
Mystic Beach is south of PCA.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.154
- Dustin, are you sure?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.281
- Who you gonna trust?

09:33.364 --> 09:36.826
Me or pretty boy?

09:36.909 --> 09:38.160
- Look, you little kid--

09:38.244 --> 09:39.245
- Hey, don't yell at
him, all right?

09:39.328 --> 09:40.288
This is your fault!

09:40.371 --> 09:41.372
Now we're 2 hours away from the

09:41.455 --> 09:42.832
party, stuck in the middle of

09:42.915 --> 09:44.041
nowhere on a deserted beach,

09:44.125 --> 09:45.042
and I'm extremely sad about it!

09:45.126 --> 09:47.253
- Will you chill?
- Not really!

09:47.336 --> 09:48.838
- Guys, let's not get
upset about it.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.089
We have our cell phones.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.966
We'll just call someone
and get a ride.

09:52.049 --> 09:52.591
- The girl says good
things.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.055
- Uh-oh.
I got no signal here.

09:58.139 --> 09:58.723
Zo?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.933
- No bars. You got bars?

10:01.017 --> 10:02.184
- No service.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.686
- Well, this is just
great.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.228
- Come on, I'm sure
Zoey 's

10:04.312 --> 10:05.229
got a plan here.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.481
What you thinking, Zo?

10:07.565 --> 10:09.358
- Well, I'm thinking...

10:10.651 --> 10:11.902
we're 2 hours away from the

10:11.986 --> 10:12.987
party, stuck in the middle of

10:13.070 --> 10:14.196
nowhere on a deserted beach, and

10:14.280 --> 10:15.740
I'm extremely sad about it!

10:32.340 --> 10:35.176
- Ok, I got to rest.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.388
- Me, too.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.599
- Ok, let's sit down for
a sec.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.062
- How long have we been
walking?

10:46.145 --> 10:48.731
- Over an hour.

10:48.814 --> 10:49.982
- Cell phone check.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.693
- No bars.

10:52.777 --> 10:53.778
- None.

10:53.861 --> 10:54.820
- Not a bar.

10:54.904 --> 10:55.363
- So what do we do now?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.365
- Keep walking?

10:57.448 --> 10:58.574
- Why? We don't even
know

10:58.657 --> 11:00.701
if we're heading in the right
direction.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.578
- We should just stay
put

11:02.661 --> 11:03.704
and wait for someone to come

11:03.788 --> 11:05.539
along and find us.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.832
- Ok.

11:06.916 --> 11:07.500
But I'm gonna go look

11:07.583 --> 11:09.377
around a little bit.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.920
- Look for what?

11:11.003 --> 11:12.755
- I don't know, a pay
phone,

11:12.838 --> 11:15.508
a person, maybe a coconut to hit

11:15.591 --> 11:17.760
you with for getting us into
this.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.178
- Hey, if it wasn't for
me,

11:19.261 --> 11:20.763
we'd all still be stuck back at
school.

11:20.846 --> 11:21.931
- You mean where
there's

11:22.014 --> 11:22.932
buildings and air conditioning

11:23.015 --> 11:24.433
and cell phone reception?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.394
- Ok, ok! Let's not
argue.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.269
Let's just all look around and

11:27.353 --> 11:27.770
see what we can find.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.527
- I found an inner
tube.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.946
- I found some old rope.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.781
- I found some broken old

11:38.864 --> 11:40.199
fishing pole.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.868
- I found sand.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.246
- Ok, this is
officially horrible.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.080
After a whole week of

11:46.163 --> 11:48.165
exams, this is our day of fun?

11:48.249 --> 11:49.333
- I know! And, like,

11:49.417 --> 11:50.668
somewhere 2 hours away from

11:50.751 --> 11:52.253
here, every student at PCA is

11:52.336 --> 11:54.797
whooping it up, and we're...not.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.798
- I was supposed to be

11:55.881 --> 11:56.966
boogie boarding right now.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.259
There's no boogie here.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.593
- You're lucky. I'm the

11:59.677 --> 12:02.304
one who was dragged here
unconscious.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.097
- You weren't
unconscious.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.808
You were sleeping involuntarily.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.892
- Whatever.

12:06.976 --> 12:07.560
- This is such a
suckish

12:07.643 --> 12:09.728
way to end the semester.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.896
- Totally.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.148
- I know.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.190
- Come on, guys! We
worked

12:13.274 --> 12:14.692
our butts off on those exams.

12:14.775 --> 12:15.818
- Yeah, we did.

12:15.901 --> 12:16.902
- And we came here to
party

12:16.986 --> 12:17.403
on the beach, right?

12:17.486 --> 12:19.738
ALL: Yeah!

12:19.822 --> 12:21.031
- Ok, then. Michael, you
got

12:21.115 --> 12:22.491
your MP3 player, right?
- Yup.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.659
- And, Dana, you got
batteries in that boom box?

12:23.742 --> 12:26.078
- Uh-huh.
- All right, then.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.163
Let's
crank up some music and quit

12:27.246 --> 12:28.456
being a bunch of lame losers.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.206
- Yeah!

12:29.290 --> 12:30.082
- Let's shake up this

12:30.166 --> 12:32.835
beach and get this party
started!

13:36.815 --> 13:37.399
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

13:37.483 --> 13:40.402
- That was so much fun!

13:41.862 --> 13:42.821
- You know, guys, I hate
to

13:42.905 --> 13:43.989
be a downer, but we are still

13:44.073 --> 13:45.407
stuck out here.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.368
- I wish our stupid cell
phones would work.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.286
- Hey, you know, I
totally forgot.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.747
I have my
laptop in my book bag.

13:51.830 --> 13:52.790
- Oh, you serious, dude?

13:52.873 --> 13:54.083
Go get it!

13:54.166 --> 13:54.917
- Wait. Why do we need
his computer?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.418
- Because if we can pick
up

13:56.502 --> 13:57.795
a network, we can instant

13:57.878 --> 13:59.088
message someone to come find us

13:59.171 --> 14:00.172
and get us out of here.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.048
- Dude, if our cell
phones

14:01.131 --> 14:03.008
don't get reception, what makes

14:03.092 --> 14:04.760
you think we'll be able to IM?

14:04.843 --> 14:05.844
- You got a better idea?

14:08.389 --> 14:10.182
- Hey, Dustin, come out
of the water!

14:10.266 --> 14:12.434
You're gonna shrivel
up like a prune!

14:12.518 --> 14:14.478
- No, I'm not coming
out!

14:14.562 --> 14:15.354
- Why not?

14:15.437 --> 14:16.355
- A big wave knocked
off

14:16.438 --> 14:18.983
my bathing suit!

14:19.066 --> 14:21.360
- Well, where is it?

14:21.443 --> 14:23.362
- If I knew, would I be

14:23.445 --> 14:26.115
naked from the waist down?

14:26.198 --> 14:27.324
- Look, you're gonna have
to

14:27.408 --> 14:28.576
come out eventually!

14:28.659 --> 14:30.244
- I'll come out when
you

14:30.327 --> 14:32.288
find me some pants!

14:33.455 --> 14:35.624
- You getting a signal?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.126
- No, just sand up my
butt.

14:37.209 --> 14:37.960
But I just figured

14:38.043 --> 14:40.379
something out. If you turn it

14:40.462 --> 14:41.130
like--
- [screams]

14:41.213 --> 14:43.173
- What?

14:43.257 --> 14:44.800
- I have an idea.

14:44.883 --> 14:47.303
- Is it about how to
restart my heart?

14:47.386 --> 14:48.929
- No. But if you let me
use

14:49.013 --> 14:50.139
your laptop and one of you guys

14:50.222 --> 14:51.473
lets me use your cell phone, I

14:51.557 --> 14:52.308
can combine the circuits and

14:52.391 --> 14:53.976
boost the RF output with the

14:54.059 --> 14:54.643
computer's battery!

14:54.727 --> 14:57.938
- And that means...?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.440
- I can probably triple
the

14:59.523 --> 15:00.774
cell phone's range so we can

15:00.858 --> 15:01.942
make a phone call!

15:02.026 --> 15:02.985
- Awesome!

15:03.068 --> 15:04.069
- But I don't want you

15:04.153 --> 15:05.112
tearing apart my laptop.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.780
- This cell phone is
like my child.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.824
- Do you want to stay
here

15:08.907 --> 15:10.200
tonight and freeze to death?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.458
- This shouldn't take
long.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.502
- You know, even if
Quinn

15:20.586 --> 15:21.545
can make that work, it's still

15:21.629 --> 15:22.838
gonna be a long time before

15:22.921 --> 15:24.340
someone comes and gets us.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.507
- Yeah, and I'm
starving.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.843
- Yeah, me, too.

15:27.926 --> 15:28.719
- Come on, Logan, Chase.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.262
Let's go catch some fish.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.847
- And what are we supposed
to use for bait?

15:31.930 --> 15:34.099
- You're a boy.
Go dig up some worms.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.351
- Gross!

15:35.434 --> 15:36.310
- Come on, I'll protect
you

15:36.393 --> 15:36.977
from the worms.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.271
- Wait! What are we

15:39.355 --> 15:40.606
supposed to do?

15:40.689 --> 15:42.650
- Build a fire.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.859
- How?

15:43.942 --> 15:44.943
- Figure it out.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.529
- You guys build that
fire.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.783
I'm gonna be working on my
tan.

16:44.336 --> 16:44.795
- Pretty good, huh?

16:44.878 --> 16:46.463
- Really good.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.340
- Yeah! So how do we

16:48.424 --> 16:49.883
light it?

16:49.967 --> 16:50.926
- I don't know.

16:51.009 --> 16:52.094
- No idea.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.303
- All right, let's
think.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.097
We're in the middle of nowhere,

16:55.180 --> 16:56.056
no matches, no lighter.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.768
How do
we start a fire?

17:00.853 --> 17:02.396
ALL: Quinn!

17:06.483 --> 17:09.444
- Yeah?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.237
- How do you start a
fire?

17:15.951 --> 17:16.910
- Anybody got a mirror?

17:16.993 --> 17:19.579
- Check Logan's
backpack.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.208
- Leave it to Logan to
bring

17:23.291 --> 17:24.292
a mirror to the beach.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.670
- Gimme.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.554
- Nothing's happening.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.724
- Wait for it.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.978
There you go.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.316
- She may be weird,
but

17:47.399 --> 17:48.734
she comes in handy.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.206
- You know, usually, I

18:02.289 --> 18:03.332
don't like fish, but this fish

18:03.415 --> 18:05.292
rocks! Doesn't this fish rock?

18:05.375 --> 18:07.461
- This fish rocks.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.421
- Hey! Can I have some
fish?

18:09.505 --> 18:12.382
- Sure!

18:17.429 --> 18:19.431
- Thank you!

18:20.599 --> 18:22.351
- You know, this day

18:22.434 --> 18:23.602
started out pretty suckish.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.479
But
I really had fun.

18:25.562 --> 18:26.688
- So you girls aren't

18:26.772 --> 18:27.689
bummed that you missed the big

18:27.773 --> 18:28.816
PCA Mystic Beach after-exam

18:28.899 --> 18:29.775
party tradition?

18:29.858 --> 18:31.652
- No, we started our own
tradition.

18:31.735 --> 18:32.444
- Yeah, I say we do
this

18:32.528 --> 18:34.947
every semester after exams.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.783
- A toast. To our new
after-exam tradition!

18:37.866 --> 18:39.368
ALL: Cheers!

18:39.451 --> 18:39.868
- Cheers!

18:39.952 --> 18:43.288
- Cheers!

18:43.372 --> 18:45.249
- I got it! I think I've

18:45.332 --> 18:46.333
increased the cell phone's range

18:46.416 --> 18:49.044
by over 400%.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.796
- Aw, my cell phone.

18:50.879 --> 18:51.922
- My laptop!

18:52.005 --> 18:53.048
- Oh, quit whining.

18:53.131 --> 18:54.550
Now who should I call?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.885
- Call a bathing suit
store!

18:56.969 --> 18:59.721
- Just call someone
because

18:59.805 --> 19:00.722
it's gonna be dark soon.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.015
- Hey, I know who we
should call.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.601
- Mr. Bender?
- Yup!

19:04.685 --> 19:05.394
- He's a teacher.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.479
- He's a cool teacher.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.147
His number's programmed into my
cell.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.816
Call him.
