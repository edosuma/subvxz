01:16.743 --> 01:17.702
I'm sorry.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.537
I wish I had better news.

01:23.917 --> 01:28.338
In modern terms,
I simply cannot get a signal.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.506
I understand, Nimue.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.466
Thanks for trying
and don't worry.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.967
I know someone who can help.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.511

Hello, Great Girl.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.439
Hi, Dad.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.608
Any luck on the big ask?

01:48.691 --> 01:52.862
I've been trying to convince
Nabu to cooperate.

01:52.946 --> 01:53.822
He will not.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.699
Well, we'll see.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.677
[theme music playing]

02:49.168 --> 02:50.628
So, how exactly are we planning

02:50.712 --> 02:52.505
to get this
Phantom Zone Projector

02:52.589 --> 02:53.965
away from the New Gods?

02:54.048 --> 02:56.175
Honestly, I have no idea.

02:56.259 --> 03:00.138
We're making this up as we go.
But one way or another,

03:00.221 --> 03:01.931
it must be destroyed.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.065

03:22.785 --> 03:24.787
[electrical buzzing]

03:36.925 --> 03:38.092
Move on, little one.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.015
We are too late.

03:44.098 --> 03:47.268
The intruders are gone,
and so is the Projector.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.561
All this New God tech

03:48.645 --> 03:50.813
and you didn't
put a tracer on a WMD.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.733
It is not
New God technology we seek,

03:53.816 --> 03:56.736
but I'm tracking the intruder's
crude rip in space-time.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.321
And I've located
the destination

03:58.404 --> 04:00.114
of their
most recent jump.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.491
Metron.

04:01.574 --> 04:04.994
At this point,
some explanation is required.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.664
We cannot risk
delay for explanation.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.042
Not unless one of you
has a Time-Sphere of your own.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.544
I thought not.

04:14.462 --> 04:15.922
[electrical buzzing]

[groaning]

04:25.264 --> 04:26.641

04:36.192 --> 04:38.152
[gasp awake, groan]

04:38.236 --> 04:39.237
Where are we?

04:39.320 --> 04:41.197
What happened?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.907
[Ma'alefa'ak]<i> Apparently,</i>
<i>Metron poisoned you</i>
<i>with Kryptonite.</i>

04:42.991 --> 04:44.867
<i>Mantis brought us</i>
<i>back to New Genesis.</i>

04:44.951 --> 04:46.286
But the Projector--

04:46.369 --> 04:50.373
Mantis acquired
the Phantom Zone Projector.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.876
Then Lor-Zod owes Mantis
a debt twice over.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.378
Thank you, Bug.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.921
I underestimated you.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.506
Now, to the Time-Sphere.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.883
[Ma'alefa'ak]<i> About that...</i>
<i>Mantis got us out,</i>

05:00.967 --> 05:03.803
<i>but did not compensate</i>
<i>for the dimensional shift.</i>

05:04.804 --> 05:05.888
[electricity crackling]

05:08.474 --> 05:09.809
Completely fried.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.895
So we are trapped
in the present.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.314
<i>Yes, like the rest</i>
<i>of the universe.</i>

05:15.398 --> 05:18.443
Indeed, the news is more
good than bad.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.737
But without the Sphere,
there's no time to lose.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.281
We must use the Projector
to free my parents at once.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.367
The Phantom Zone Projector
is dead,

05:26.451 --> 05:28.286
drained of energy.

05:28.369 --> 05:31.622
Well, after so many years,
that's hardly surprising.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.250
Recharging it will require
substantial power.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.837
Mantis knows just the place.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.009
Again, we are too late.

05:43.092 --> 05:44.052
They are gone.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.765
There is some hope.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.892
This Time-Sphere
is nonfunctional.

05:50.975 --> 05:56.439
So these thieves are trapped on
this world in this time period.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.525
And thus will seek to activate
the Projector at once.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.360
Then why not activate it here?

06:01.444 --> 06:03.613
A significant source of power
is required.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.032
And again, it might help
if you explained

06:06.115 --> 06:07.575
what this Projector's for.

06:07.658 --> 06:11.496
At this juncture, deciding
the fate of the galaxy.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.253
[Forager groaning]

06:19.337 --> 06:22.173
Forager can see
Forager is till torn,

06:22.256 --> 06:25.301
between staying with Forager
on New Genesis,

06:25.384 --> 06:28.304
or returning to Forager's
Earth hive.

06:28.387 --> 06:32.058
But the answer to Forager's
dilemma is simple.

06:32.141 --> 06:35.937
Forager will go to Forager's
Earth hive with Forager.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.356
Forager would do that
for Forager?

06:38.439 --> 06:41.984
Of course.
Forager loves Forager.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.279
Besides,
foraging on a new world

06:45.363 --> 06:48.324
would be an awfully
big adventure.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.742
[loving clicks]

06:54.455 --> 06:56.999
We must split up
and make preparations.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.794
There's not a moment to lose if
we want to prevent an invasion

06:59.877 --> 07:01.170
from the Phantom Zone.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.463
The Phantom what now?

07:09.011 --> 07:11.013
[Dru-Zod]<i> The boy</i>
<i>is most impressive.</i>

07:25.736 --> 07:28.030
<i>But there is still much</i>
<i>he might tell us of home.</i>

07:28.114 --> 07:32.118
<i>In time, we will learn</i>
<i>all this Superboy knows.</i>

07:32.702 --> 07:34.036

07:34.120 --> 07:36.164
[Metron]
<i>Do you finally understand?</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:39.500
Decades ago, I received
the Phantom Zone Projector

07:39.584 --> 07:42.211
in a technology exchange
with the planet Krypton.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.673
So all this time,
you've known there were
surviving Kryptonians--

07:45.756 --> 07:47.800
in an interdimensional prison,
no less?

07:47.884 --> 07:52.054
And now another Kryptonian,
a time traveler, is determined
to set them free?

07:52.138 --> 07:53.431
Hundreds of criminals?

07:53.514 --> 07:55.474
The worst Krypton had to offer.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.602
All with the
powers of Superman?

07:57.685 --> 07:59.562
Have I not said as much?

07:59.645 --> 08:00.897
Yes, Metron.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.232
Eventually,
you got around to it.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.775
Then let us move on.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.111
I have analyzed the Projector's
power requirements.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.906
There are multiple
potential sources
on Supertown.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.950
<i>It is essential that Highfather</i>
<i>organize their defense,</i>

08:13.034 --> 08:16.621
<i>mobilizing the Divine Guard</i>
<i>and every New God,</i>

08:16.704 --> 08:18.372
<i>high born and low,</i>

08:18.456 --> 08:21.209
<i>to ensure that this rogue</i>
<i>Kryptonian has no opportunity</i>

08:21.292 --> 08:23.169
<i>to access the power</i>
<i>he needs here.</i>

08:23.252 --> 08:27.298
But there are two other
locations on New Genesis,
likelier targets,

08:27.381 --> 08:30.092
which those gathered
here must defend.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.095
Tarru!

08:38.309 --> 08:39.894
Stay frosty, poozers.

Ha!

09:11.300 --> 09:13.052
Now that it is
sufficiently charged,

09:13.135 --> 09:15.346
it will absorb the lake's
natural Source energy
even faster.

including communications.

We are on our own.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.996
Perfect.

Wait, don't you need Motherbox
to, you know, keep your head?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.500
It will be difficult,

09:44.583 --> 09:47.086
but I've learned to overcome
such challenges.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.118
Flash must seal sky hole,

15:11.201 --> 15:13.495
while Forager engages
floating cube weapon.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.830
On it.

15:14.913 --> 15:18.208
[screams]

15:18.292 --> 15:23.172
Mantis warned Forager
never to return to New Genesis.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.132
Yes, but Mantis' warning came

15:25.215 --> 15:27.384
before Forager
trained with Nightwing.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.100
I may not know
how to close that hole,

15:35.184 --> 15:37.269
but I can stop
anyone from using it.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.023
No!

15:43.359 --> 15:44.777
I have to save you.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.363
No, you fool!
We want to get out.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.408
The pressure, it's too strong.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.118
But there!

15:54.203 --> 15:55.746
The corporeal world!

15:56.330 --> 15:57.539
[screams]

15:57.623 --> 15:58.582
Forager!

16:01.794 --> 16:02.878
[shrieking]

16:09.968 --> 16:12.388
[Tomar-Re's ring]<i> Cascade,</i>
<i>91% redirected.</i>

16:18.477 --> 16:20.896
<i>Willpower insufficient</i>
<i>to maintain both</i>

16:20.979 --> 16:22.356
<i>shield and funnel.</i>

16:22.439 --> 16:24.066
<i>Cascade funnel failing.</i>

16:24.149 --> 16:25.150
Never again.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.944
<i>Atmospheric ignition imminent.</i>

16:29.071 --> 16:30.406
[groaning in pain]

16:39.707 --> 16:42.835
<i>Cascade, 100% redirected.</i>

16:44.586 --> 16:46.547
<i>Cascade averted.</i>

16:55.013 --> 16:55.931
Now!

17:08.360 --> 17:09.945
[shrieking continues]

17:16.702 --> 17:18.954
<i>You have been chosen by my ring</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:22.750

17:22.833 --> 17:25.544
<i>Now, speak our oath.</i>

17:26.837 --> 17:28.172
<i>In brightest day...</i>

17:28.255 --> 17:29.506
-In brightest day,
<i>-In blackest night...</i>

17:29.590 --> 17:30.841
In blackest night...

17:30.924 --> 17:32.301
<i>No evil shall escape</i>
<i>my sight...</i>

17:32.384 --> 17:34.845
No evil shall escape
Forager's sight...

17:34.928 --> 17:36.472
<i>Let those who worship</i>
<i>evil's might...</i>

17:36.555 --> 17:38.140
Let sentients who worship
evil's might...

17:38.223 --> 17:41.393
<i>-Beware my power...</i>
-Beware Forager's power...

17:41.477 --> 17:44.354
<i>-Green Lantern's light.</i>
-Green Lantern's light.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.496
Bio-Ship, target the Projector.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.756
[gasps]

18:15.844 --> 18:17.554
Phantom Girl, wake up!

18:18.180 --> 18:19.014
[gasps]

18:20.974 --> 18:22.601
No!

18:26.563 --> 18:27.606
What just...

18:41.161 --> 18:43.121
[Bio-Ship and Saturn Girl
scream]

18:43.205 --> 18:47.334
Get us out of here now,
or I will snap her neck.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.177
[Rocket] Orion,
are you all right?

18:57.845 --> 19:00.556
I am well enough.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.933
But...

19:04.726 --> 19:06.186
Where's Tomar-Re?

19:09.648 --> 19:11.567
[melancholy music playing]

19:41.847 --> 19:43.182
[Metron] This damaged Sphere

19:43.265 --> 19:46.810
should provide opportunity
for further study.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.480
Small recompense
for the loss of the Projector.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.065
Such a waste.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.944
[Kilowog]
Your friend, Rocket, was right.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.030
We'll work out
the details later.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.450
But in principle, the treaty
between the New Gods,
the Green Lantern Corps,

20:01.533 --> 20:04.494
and the Justice League
can be considered signed.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.954
That's great. Truly.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.415
Now we can help each other
find the rogue Kryptonian

20:08.498 --> 20:10.250
and rogue Martian
still on the loose.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.503
Oh, trust me, the hunt is on.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.963
The Corps doesn't take
the killing

20:15.047 --> 20:16.465
of one of our own lightly.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.300
Well, at least
we captured Mantis

20:18.383 --> 20:20.469
and confiscated
that torture cube.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.014
Yes, Mantis will be tried
here on New Genesis.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.183
As for the torture cube,

20:26.266 --> 20:28.977
it seems to possess
some sentience.

20:29.061 --> 20:29.937
Seriously?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.563
Yeah.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.608
We're taking the evil little
poozer to a science cell on Oa.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.861
Forager has become
a probationary member

20:37.945 --> 20:42.991
of the Green Lantern Corps,
but Forager is torn.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.578
Forager wanted to accompany
Forager to Earth.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.664
But Forager can see how excited

20:48.747 --> 20:50.999
Forager is to become
a Green Lantern

20:51.083 --> 20:53.168
and would never ask Forager
to give up

20:53.251 --> 20:57.005
such an awfully big adventure
for Forager's sake.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.884
So Forager will return
to Forager's Earth hive
and Earth friends,

21:00.968 --> 21:03.428
and probationary
Green Lantern Forager

21:03.512 --> 21:07.724
will go with Green Lantern
Kilowog to Oa for training.

21:07.808 --> 21:12.646
But perhaps Forager and Forager
could attempt a relationship...

21:12.729 --> 21:14.481
long distance?

21:14.564 --> 21:16.650
Forager's Green Lantern ring

21:16.733 --> 21:19.987
should make
visiting Earth possible.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.281
Until then,

21:23.365 --> 21:26.201
take this favorite book
of Forager's.

21:26.284 --> 21:28.036
Forager has circled passages

21:28.120 --> 21:30.747
that recall Forager's
feeling for Forager,

21:30.831 --> 21:36.044
which no distance,
however long, may dilute.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.254
[loving clicks]

21:38.422 --> 21:39.965
I'm glad I met you, Orion.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.467
As am I.

21:42.551 --> 21:46.221
You deal with
unique challenges,
friend Rocket.

21:46.304 --> 21:50.267
But I believe you will learn
to make those challenges
your strengths.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.107
Thank you for seeing me.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.790
You deal with
unique challenges,
friend Rocket.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.376
Now we have to face this,
deal with it.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.337
You need to take
a closer look, my friend.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.174
<i>You're worried about</i>
<i>the wrong things, Raq.</i>

22:23.175 --> 22:26.011
Thank you for seeing me.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.017
Mama's home.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.484
I see you, Amistad.

22:41.568 --> 22:42.527
I see you.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.241
Bart, I'm home.

22:51.536 --> 22:52.454
Bart?

22:55.791 --> 22:59.503
[Madam Xanadu]
If I might ask, Great Nabu...

22:59.586 --> 23:02.756
how in the world did Zatanna
get you to agree to this?

23:02.839 --> 23:07.469
[Nabu/Zatanna] By swearing
she would give us
no peace until we complied.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.805
Now, let us begin.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.522
[bell chimes]

23:28.323 --> 23:29.825
[Zatanna]
I just don't understand.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.953
With all this power,
how could we have failed?

23:33.036 --> 23:36.081
Perhaps Conner Kent
has attained his final rest.

23:36.164 --> 23:40.502
Perhaps we cannot find him
because his spirit is at peace.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.337
Perhaps...

23:42.420 --> 23:45.382
Or perhaps
Conner's not dead at all.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.758
And if he's not dead,

23:46.842 --> 23:49.177
then I don't need
magic to find him.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.139
What I need is a detective.

24:01.773 --> 24:05.318
[Mountain Forager]
<i>Doubt, Forager,</i>
<i>the stars are fire.</i>

24:05.402 --> 24:11.449
<i>Doubt that the sun doth move,</i>
<i>doubt truth to be a liar,</i>

24:12.367 --> 24:16.705
<i>but never doubt Forager loves.</i>

24:16.788 --> 24:22.335
<i>O, dear Forager, Forager</i>
<i>is ill at these numbers.</i>

24:22.419 --> 24:27.716
<i>Forager has not art to reckon</i>
<i>Forager's groans,</i>

24:27.799 --> 24:34.389
<i>but that Forager loves</i>
<i>Forager best, O most best,</i>

24:34.472 --> 24:39.728
