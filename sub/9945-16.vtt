00:07.020 --> 00:10.818
Come and watch pikeys
making a mess of the lives

00:10.820 --> 00:13.659
they were given by him upstairs

00:14.260 --> 00:18.179
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.180 --> 00:21.979
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:21.980 --> 00:24.659
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.660 --> 00:27.699
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:27.700 --> 00:31.699
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented

00:31.780 --> 00:35.779
to calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:36.740 --> 00:40.739
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:40.780 --> 00:44.779
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:44.860 --> 00:48.859
You shit on our heads,
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.140 --> 00:56.259
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:56.260 --> 00:58.779
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:58.780 --> 01:02.779
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:02.940 --> 01:06.939

01:23.540 --> 01:27.539
Is this the gaff?
I thought you said she'd moved.

01:28.260 --> 01:32.259
She did.

DISTORTED SOUNDS

01:47.100 --> 01:50.419
My daughter, Patrick. Rachel.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.899
Of course, she looked different
towards the end,

01:52.900 --> 01:54.739
once the heroin had got hold of her.

01:54.740 --> 01:58.139
- You gave it to me.
- (PADDY) No.

tales of witches and ogres

02:10.300 --> 02:13.819
'who'd gobble up children. I'd have
nightmares, scream the place down.'

02:13.820 --> 02:15.499
Morning.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.219
Just up?

02:17.220 --> 02:19.459
(MIMI) I didn't sleep too good.

02:19.460 --> 02:23.059
'Before you know it,
you're a parent yourself.

02:23.060 --> 02:26.299
'The joys are beyond expectation,
but the fear paralyses beyond words.

02:26.300 --> 02:27.979
Not saying hello?

02:27.980 --> 02:30.259
- Uurgh.
- Turkish wrestling.

Big hairy blokes in leather shorts
covering themselves in oil,

02:34.580 --> 02:38.579

terrifying fairytales
that kept you awake

02:43.340 --> 02:47.339
'to prepare them for just
how hardcore this world can be.

'Because monsters do exist.'

Jesus Christ!

02:54.380 --> 02:57.619
- What are you doing?
Jamie's downstairs.
- I just want to talk.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.619
- Where's Mandy?
- Going to her folks,

02:59.620 --> 03:01.459
tell them about
the engagement party.

03:01.460 --> 03:04.739
Tomorrow night,
if you and Dad can make it.

03:04.740 --> 03:08.739
I know it's short notice, so...

03:15.340 --> 03:19.339
We couldn't really move on
from his affair.

03:20.020 --> 03:22.419
- Affair?
- (MICKY) Who's taped over

03:22.420 --> 03:24.499
me Turkish wrestling?

03:24.500 --> 03:28.499
How many affairs have you heard of
where a person kidnaps another

03:28.540 --> 03:31.259
- and turns him into a smackhead?
- I'll kill ya!

03:31.260 --> 03:34.019
This wasn't some great romance, Mum.
'Then comes the day

03:34.020 --> 03:36.699
'when strangers
don't scare them any more,

03:36.700 --> 03:38.699
'and that's when
your nightmares return.'

03:38.700 --> 03:40.979
(JOE) I don't want to
hurt her again.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.499
She's a good person.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.499
She's the kind of girl you love
and want to spend the rest of your
life with.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.419
Whereas you, however...

03:50.420 --> 03:54.419
are a dirty slag
who shagged your best mate's fella,

03:54.860 --> 03:58.859
cos that's all you're good for,
with your tight tops
and your short skirts.

04:03.580 --> 04:07.579
- How far gone?
- Fuck off and die!

04:13.060 --> 04:17.059
You don't know whose it is, do you?

04:17.860 --> 04:21.858
Oh, now you really belong to me.

04:23.140 --> 04:27.139
Jamie!

04:32.940 --> 04:35.299
(JAMIE) I never really thought
I wanted to.

04:35.300 --> 04:36.939
But do you now?

04:36.940 --> 04:39.139
Want one, I mean?

04:39.140 --> 04:41.619
You can't control these things.

04:41.620 --> 04:44.019
If it comes, it comes.
If it doesn't...

04:44.020 --> 04:47.699
well, that's fine, too.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.939
I'll try.

04:50.940 --> 04:54.939
It's not about trying.
It's about nature, and biology.

04:58.980 --> 05:01.099
Come on, Debs,
I gotta go to the post office.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.619
Well, take her with you.

05:02.620 --> 05:06.619
The post office? Don't be daft!
She hasn't had all her jabs yet.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.179
Has she?

05:08.180 --> 05:12.179
- Liam, school.
- Oh, Fiona...

05:12.820 --> 05:15.779
- Exactly.
- See you, Frank.

05:15.780 --> 05:19.779
You can't leave me
in charge of a baby!

05:22.380 --> 05:23.739
Oh, get off!

05:23.740 --> 05:27.739
Don't even waste your breath, Frank.

05:28.180 --> 05:31.459
- I think she's shat herself.
- What are you doing?

05:31.460 --> 05:33.259
You can't shirk your responsibility,
Yvonne.

05:33.260 --> 05:37.259
I only agreed to foster Liam
and Stella so you could keep
your family together.

05:37.540 --> 05:40.379
Oi, get back here!
I'm not a fucking nanny, Frank!

05:40.380 --> 05:44.379
- I've got a shop to run.
- Language, Yvonne.

05:47.220 --> 05:49.899
(DEBBIE) Oh, I don't believe it!

05:49.900 --> 05:53.059

the funeral parlour
for more than an hour.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.619
of ever more outlandish buffoonery

in a vain attempt
to get his appendage gobbled

06:01.100 --> 06:05.099
by one or preferably two handbags.

06:07.020 --> 06:11.019
Wait. A rival gamma male approaches,
boasting a larger appendage...

06:11.740 --> 06:13.259

- Women!

06:17.820 --> 06:19.419
What's all that about?

06:19.420 --> 06:23.099
Women have a different
selection process, Carl.

06:23.100 --> 06:27.099
You know, they want transport.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.619
Money.

06:29.620 --> 06:33.619
They want mobility.
A change of scenery.

06:34.220 --> 06:37.379
They don't all want to hang around
the Chatsworth and go to The Jockey.

06:37.380 --> 06:38.579
Where you two off?

06:38.580 --> 06:42.579

- 120 in tips.

07:48.940 --> 07:51.659
- What, for one night's work?
- Where's this?

07:51.660 --> 07:53.139
Any jobs going?

Spit roast bar and grill behind
Selfridges. VIPs, valet parking.

don't be offended if we slip out...

Ah, babe, I'm feeling a bit shagged,
you know?

08:05.740 --> 08:08.219
- Wouldn't mind rolling a fat one...
- Fucking students.

08:08.220 --> 08:12.219
I'm back in at nine. Anyway, what
are you doing that's so important?

08:12.540 --> 08:16.299
Getting the money back for this suit
and buying myself a new motor.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.219
- Probably score more birds.
- You're like some Benny Hill
character!

08:20.220 --> 08:22.979
Go on! That's me.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.139
When did you set your sights so low,
Carl?

08:25.140 --> 08:26.779
What, cos I like shagging?

08:26.780 --> 08:28.979
Liking shagging
I've got no problem with.

08:28.980 --> 08:31.139
Finding reasons to maintain
a friendship with someone

08:31.140 --> 08:34.979
who acts more and more like a
walking ball-bag increasingly is.

08:34.980 --> 08:38.979
So you get yourself a car
and fuck off.

08:40.140 --> 08:44.139
Mandy!

08:49.620 --> 08:51.459
Can I give you a lift?

08:51.460 --> 08:54.459
Joe's picking us up in a minute.
Just at the kerb's fine.

08:54.460 --> 08:58.459
Moving in, then, eh?

08:58.620 --> 09:00.459
Heard you were working for him,
too, now.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.059

Yeah, right(!)

Just renting out flats to DSS.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.299
I didn't mean to seem weird before.

09:14.300 --> 09:18.299
I think she's missing you
pretty badly.

09:22.420 --> 09:26.139
- Where on earth did you find this?
- I've had it years.

09:26.140 --> 09:27.979
It was your granny's.

09:27.980 --> 09:31.619
(HIGH-PITCHED) Kept her stuff in it.

09:31.620 --> 09:35.619
I like it. It smells of her.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.979
How are you doing?

09:46.980 --> 09:49.179
Can't complain. Busy.

09:49.180 --> 09:51.579
Got to get out, crack some heads.

09:51.580 --> 09:55.059
There's a few debts I've neglected
to take care of recently.

09:55.060 --> 09:58.899

We're having an engagement party.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.339

10:05.260 --> 10:08.819
Nearly there.
Just a couple more boxes.

10:08.820 --> 10:12.819
All right, Paddy?

10:19.380 --> 10:23.379
Flippin' heck! Gonna need
a new gaff for all this stuff, eh?

10:23.740 --> 10:27.739
Right, better get on with it.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.619
See you tomorrow, then?

10:31.620 --> 10:35.619
Tomorrow.

10:51.220 --> 10:54.059
You and me have
some unfinished business, Raymondo!

10:54.060 --> 10:58.059
Oh, Paddy, Paddy! Er...

10:58.980 --> 11:02.979
Fuck!

11:04.380 --> 11:07.979
- You got any naloxone?
- I got rid in case the Feds
raided...

11:07.980 --> 11:10.819
It's fuckin' legal,
you stupid bastard!

11:10.820 --> 11:14.819
But they can sue you for injecting
someone against their consent or...

11:15.140 --> 11:18.179
You're a fucking idiot!
She's still breathing.

11:18.180 --> 11:22.179
Call an ambulance.

11:22.260 --> 11:26.259
I've got no battery.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.339
(MAN) Balls! Argh! Me balls!

11:37.340 --> 11:41.339
- Argh! Me balls!
- Micky!

11:51.340 --> 11:54.699
- What's her name?
- I dunno, we found her
in the street.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.539
- OK, and what's she had?
- Heroin.

11:56.540 --> 12:00.539
Mm-hm?

12:07.260 --> 12:11.259
OK, naloxone, two milligrams.

12:20.420 --> 12:24.419
OK, just keep her talking
and get me IV access.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.619
- (NURSE) You're OK. It's OK.
- Give me IV access,

12:28.620 --> 12:32.619
keep her monitored,
and give her oxygen, OK?

12:44.640 --> 12:48.639
Oh, fuck!

12:50.240 --> 12:52.479
Er...Post Office police,
coming through. 'Scuse me.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.239
'Scuse me, Post Office bobby.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.239
You'll be all right.
Just do as I say. All right.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.879
Hiya, Frank.
Can you lend us a smoke?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.799

you pregnant again?

13:06.800 --> 13:08.919
Yeah, getting engaged an' all
when I turn 14.

13:08.920 --> 13:12.399
Well, congratulations, kid,
that's just what we need round here.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.879
What's this? Where's the rest?

13:14.880 --> 13:17.519
Fuck off! Child benefit, 18.10,

13:17.520 --> 13:21.519
times two kids' worth.
Check it again.

13:28.680 --> 13:32.679
Right, if you think
I'm fuckin' about here all day,
filling in a new claims form,

13:33.880 --> 13:35.999
think a-fuckin'-gain!

13:36.000 --> 13:39.759
Gallagher, Vernon Francis,
child benefit. Restart.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.679
Now!

13:41.680 --> 13:43.679
Stop!

13:43.680 --> 13:47.679
This is housing benefit.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.919
Housing benefit.

13:49.920 --> 13:53.919
If it's about a child benefit claim,
you're in the wrong department.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.359
'Scuse me, love. I want to report
a violation of the Human Rights Act.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.879
Hang on, mate...

14:12.880 --> 14:15.719
I thought he...
I thought he was Mick Hucknall.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.559
I've got this phobia about him -
it's fuckin' worse than clowns.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.879
It's not gingers per se,
you know, I'm cool with th...

14:21.880 --> 14:24.399

Well, not best mates, but...

14:24.400 --> 14:28.399
You know, it's just that
curly-haired, ginger ponce.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.679
He just gives me the creeps!

14:30.680 --> 14:33.519
It's an involuntary
medical condition.

14:33.520 --> 14:37.039
Even the mention of his name
gives me the willies.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.519
He just crept up on us!
I know it's not him...

14:39.520 --> 14:43.479
He looks so like him!
It's just something gets me started.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.559
Have you got a car for sale?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.719
What's the address?
I'm coming down now.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.719
Anchor Way? Well, I'm on Anchor Way
now. Where the fuck is CK Autos?

14:51.800 --> 14:55.799
All right, Carlos?

It's a bit fuckin' different
to the photo, Ches.

14:59.640 --> 15:03.239
It's an old photo, that.It's
a different reg and everything!

15:03.240 --> 15:05.479
I sell loads of these.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.399
Low profile. You'll never get a pull
from the dibble in one of these.

15:08.400 --> 15:12.399
It's a classic.
The ladies love a classic.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.719

15:21.720 --> 15:25.719

Fuckin' score down the drain.

Basic business, Carlos.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.839
You scratch it, I sue. Comprende?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.999
I don't need to tell you to keep
your mouth shut about this, do I?

16:05.280 --> 16:09.279
So what was it? Bad smack?
Is there another kind?

16:10.960 --> 16:12.839
No. I mean...

16:12.840 --> 16:15.079
if there's contaminated drugs
out there,

16:15.080 --> 16:17.239
then people should know, right?
Yeah.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.719
Too strong for her. Second time
she's been in this month.

16:19.720 --> 16:23.719
I mean, I can see if they've got
a bed for her tonight, but...

The man's a Photoshop genius!

19:13.200 --> 19:17.199
What are you up to?
Can't tell you.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.159
Liam...

19:27.160 --> 19:29.159
So it has come to this,

19:29.160 --> 19:33.159
that a decent, hard-working man
of this once great nation

19:33.840 --> 19:37.839
should be deprived of a parent's
basic staple - the child benefit!

19:39.280 --> 19:41.479
Well, if it comes to the choice

19:41.480 --> 19:45.479
of starving by the roadside
or martyrdom...

19:48.000 --> 19:51.279
..give me immortality!

19:51.280 --> 19:53.039

19:53.040 --> 19:55.239

I need change!Hey! Get out!

19:57.640 --> 20:01.639
I need change! I need change!

20:04.800 --> 20:08.759
See? What did I tell you?
It's a recognised medical condition.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.159
What's this about child benefits?

20:11.160 --> 20:14.519
One of the few benefits of having
'em, and now they've stopped it.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.159
Well, what do you expect?

20:17.160 --> 20:19.599
Liam and Stella are wards of court,
in foster care.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.879
So Liam has to get a job
in a call centre to pay for his
Turkey Twizzlers?

20:22.880 --> 20:26.879
No. His foster parents
are expected to pay for them
out of their allowance.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.559
Foster care allowance.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.159
Have you got any tinned pate, Stan?
No, I don't think we sell it.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.279
271.68 a week for Stella...

20:36.280 --> 20:39.519
It's like tripe and rabbit in jelly.
Pate - you know, for going on toast?

20:39.520 --> 20:41.399
..for Liam. Where's my fuckin' end?

20:41.400 --> 20:44.239
Did the tin have a picture
of a cat?That's it.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.759
..any kids to foster if it
wasn't for me. Me fuckin'
child benefit's been stopped!

20:47.760 --> 20:49.359
Was it called Pussy Munch?

20:56.960 --> 21:00.959
That money's stopped me

I've had her all day anyway.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.279
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
The Government themselves

21:04.280 --> 21:08.159
have decided to retire me
from the parenting game.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.919
She's your legal responsibility now,
Yvonne.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.719
You can't go abandoning children,
can you?

21:13.720 --> 21:16.839
Frowned upon in fostering circles,
innit?

21:16.840 --> 21:18.479
Right...

21:18.480 --> 21:22.599
I'll give Debbie 40 a week -
that'll cover the child benefit.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.759
You have Stella nine while six

21:24.760 --> 21:27.199

for four years tonight!

26:01.380 --> 26:04.699
You know, when I first saw him,

26:04.700 --> 26:08.699
he was playing
in the final against Aberjaizan.

26:09.140 --> 26:13.139
In the very last minutes, he took
the ball from his own goalposts,

26:13.500 --> 26:15.699
down the wing,
shaking off defenders,

26:15.700 --> 26:17.459

35:08.580 --> 35:12.579

for someone to blame.

35:16.740 --> 35:20.499

for the death of my child,

35:20.500 --> 35:24.499

36:12.980 --> 36:16.979
"Cheers for the fuckin' video, mate,

36:54.180 --> 36:57.459
What's up with you?You.

36:57.460 --> 37:00.219
Why are you being all moody now?
I thought we had a buzz.

37:00.220 --> 37:03.139
It was a laugh,
being different people.

37:03.140 --> 37:07.139
But now you default to being the
same reject from a Carry On film.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.259
Do you want to hear a theory?

37:17.260 --> 37:18.739
Carl...

37:18.740 --> 37:20.379
not as thick as he looks.

37:20.380 --> 37:21.939
Hmm!

37:21.940 --> 37:23.459
Hmm.

37:23.460 --> 37:27.179
It's a wild theory. If it's true,
the universe might just implode.

37:27.180 --> 37:30.699
What if it's all a ploy
to make you jealous?How?

37:30.700 --> 37:33.179
I might have been interested once,
but now...

37:33.180 --> 37:36.379
Cos it did provoke
a pretty extreme reaction.

37:36.380 --> 37:39.219
He might not have anticipated
you turning up at the club.

37:39.220 --> 37:43.219
But since you did,
all your cards are laid on the table.

37:43.220 --> 37:46.699

meaningless.

The wonder of nature, Bunty.

38:03.180 --> 38:05.779
A joy to be around. A gift.

38:05.780 --> 38:09.779
Yeah. It's a shame
you never had any of your own.

38:09.900 --> 38:13.899
You can't put a price
on spending time with your kids.

38:13.900 --> 38:17.899
But if you had to,
how does 50 pence an hour sound?

38:18.300 --> 38:22.179
The RSPCA might not be prepared to
give you a second chance, Bunty,

38:22.180 --> 38:24.979
but I will.Deal.Great.

38:24.980 --> 38:28.979
See you later.

38:30.020 --> 38:32.939
If I can give him a second chance,
you should be able to.

38:32.940 --> 38:36.539
You can't go through with this.
You've gotta call the engagement off.

38:36.540 --> 38:40.019
I'm trying to tell you something,
and I don't know how to tell you it.

38:40.020 --> 38:42.899
Would this be the same thing
you've been saying since I met him?

38:42.900 --> 38:46.899
No! Although I do think he's a cunt.
I wish you'd never laid eyes on him.

38:47.860 --> 38:50.419
Have you any idea
what it's like trying to move on,

38:50.420 --> 38:52.259
knowing that not even
everyone you know

38:52.260 --> 38:54.579
but everyone you care about
thinks you're a knob

38:54.580 --> 38:57.179
because of something
they know fuck-all about?

38:57.180 --> 39:00.579
Any fucking idea how insulting
to my intelligence that is?

39:00.580 --> 39:04.579
He fucked me!

39:05.900 --> 39:09.899
I'm pregnant.

39:20.780 --> 39:23.379
Karen...

39:23.380 --> 39:26.979
..you need help.

39:26.980 --> 39:29.659
I think you might need to
see someone.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.539
You're retreating
into your own little fantasy world

39:32.540 --> 39:34.979
to compensate for your problems.

39:34.980 --> 39:36.899
Problems?

39:36.900 --> 39:38.739
Losing the baby.

39:38.740 --> 39:42.739
And I know you're not happy.

39:42.860 --> 39:46.179
Joe's told me about what happened...

39:46.180 --> 39:47.779
..when you...

39:47.780 --> 39:51.779
You coming on to him at the
football.

39:51.860 --> 39:55.739
I'm not angry.

39:55.740 --> 39:58.859
He's not angry.
What the fuck are you talking about?

39:58.860 --> 40:02.859
Karen, it's not an admission of
defeat to take some help.

40:04.220 --> 40:08.219
Do you know what?

40:08.220 --> 40:12.219
Just get the fuck away from me!
I was trying to help you.

40:13.940 --> 40:15.579
Just do one!

40:15.580 --> 40:18.259
KNOCK AT DOOR

40:18.260 --> 40:22.259
Sorry. Mandy, phone for you.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.339
You're not gonna believe this.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.739
A woman's just called to say
she's found a wallet

40:29.740 --> 40:32.779
with 300 quid in it, no ID,
just a raffle ticket

40:32.780 --> 40:35.099
for a raffle at The Jockey pub,
Chatsworth.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.979
Can I return it to the owner, or
should she take it to the police?

40:38.980 --> 40:41.539
No!Serious!

40:41.540 --> 40:45.539
That could be someone's wages.
Wages?Wages? That's a killer!

40:48.300 --> 40:50.339
OK. Attention, everyone!

40:50.340 --> 40:53.459
It's probably not worth asking,
but has anyone lost a wallet

40:53.460 --> 40:55.499
with 300 quid...

40:55.500 --> 40:59.499
EVERYONE SHOUTS

41:02.460 --> 41:04.339
300 quid...raffle ticket...

41:04.340 --> 41:06.539
There is no wallet.
She's winding you up.

41:06.540 --> 41:09.539
Seriously, I was just sat there,
thinking,

41:09.540 --> 41:11.219
"I'll just get myself another pint."

41:11.220 --> 41:15.219
I put my hand in my pocket, thought,
"Funny - where's my wallet?"

41:15.780 --> 41:19.779
I'm just...
As if you'd buy a raffle ticket.

41:21.180 --> 41:25.179
How dare you?!

41:25.260 --> 41:29.259
Nice little engagement gift, that.
Get back here with the dough, rapid.

41:29.300 --> 41:31.259
I can't be dealing with this
engagement do

41:31.260 --> 41:32.459

tradition of the fairytale,

41:53.780 --> 41:57.659
it begins, "Once upon a time..."

41:57.660 --> 42:01.219
and ends, "..happily ever after."

42:01.220 --> 42:05.219
But...just like old Lenny Crabsticks
sang in that song...

42:06.740 --> 42:10.739

till it's over.

42:17.420 --> 42:19.299
Hello. I'm Mandy Maguire.

42:19.300 --> 42:23.299
We spoke on the phone
earlier about the wallet.

42:27.890 --> 42:31.889
And the winning ticket is...
number 76!

42:32.370 --> 42:36.369
Yeah, baby!

42:37.890 --> 42:41.889
Get on! Yeah!

42:50.510 --> 42:53.989
Hello, sweetheart. How are you?

42:53.990 --> 42:55.469
You all right?

42:55.470 --> 42:56.789
Mimi.

42:56.790 --> 43:00.789
That problem.
I want you to know I've fixed it.

43:01.190 --> 43:02.789
Maureen?

43:01.790 --> 43:05.789
That psycho bitch was outside
my house at 5 o'clock this morning,

43:06.310 --> 43:10.309
threatening to kill herself,
screaming all over the estate,
looking for you.

43:11.190 --> 43:13.229
You haven't sorted anything.

43:13.230 --> 43:17.229
You've just made things worse. Now
you really will have to sort it.

43:17.510 --> 43:21.509
Joe's car's outside. They're here.

43:23.830 --> 43:27.389

43:32.990 --> 43:36.989

43:57.470 --> 44:01.469

44:01.790 --> 44:05.789
The one that kidnapped him?

44:08.270 --> 44:11.109
I just think it's about time
we put this whole thing to bed,

44:11.110 --> 44:15.109
if you'll help me.

44:19.510 --> 44:23.509
I'll just go and see
if the kettle's boiled.

44:34.070 --> 44:36.949
It's not fair. I took that call.
She could have told me about it.

44:36.950 --> 44:40.509
300 quid? No way would I have told
any of you fuckers!

44:40.510 --> 44:42.389
Why didn't she?
I dunno.

44:42.390 --> 44:44.949
She specifically asked
for Mandy Maguire.

44:44.950 --> 44:48.949
