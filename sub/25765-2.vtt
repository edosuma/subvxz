01:20.480 --> 01:21.550
...six every touchdown.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.315
- But who keeps track of that?
- It's all on the computer.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.513
Computer does everything.
Every stat gets converted into points.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.115
I don't know.
Sounds kind of dumb, to be honest.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.318
- I just wanna watch the game.
- You're afraid to lose 20 bucks.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.110
You wanna bet, let's do it.
Why mess with all this extra stuff?

01:37.320 --> 01:41.837
Trust me, it's fun. You end up cheering
for a lot of weird things on Sunday.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.879
He's no longer in a coma,
but he's unresponsive.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.633
His condition is stable.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.792
They're managing his blood pressure.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.555
But whether he will wake up...

02:09.720 --> 02:12.519
...and understand
what's going on around him...

02:12.680 --> 02:14.478
...there's no way of knowing.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.871
That's unacceptable.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.797
Gustavo, he's getting
very good care here.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.431
There's very little
even the best hospitals could do.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.633
Now...

02:27.240 --> 02:30.119
...might it be different
if he was in the care...

02:30.280 --> 02:35.560
...of someplace
like Johns Hopkins, perhaps?

02:37.640 --> 02:39.359
Or...

02:40.560 --> 02:43.712
...it could make no difference at all.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.516
But in the end...

02:48.760 --> 02:50.877
In the end...

02:52.640 --> 02:55.633
...I can think of no better judgment
on this man.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.480
Isn't this what he deserves?

03:03.440 --> 03:07.070
I decide what he deserves.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.236
No one else.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.395
There she is.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.951
Want some fresh OJ?

04:12.400 --> 04:15.677
Good. Vitamin C.
It'll help you heal quicker.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.832
I don't think it works like that.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.079
It might. You don't know.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.952
I'm good.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.875
Oh, I've also got leftover bacon
from my breakfast sandwich.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.271
That's got definite healing powers.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.113
Okay, that I believe.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.478
And I made coffee,
put a little cinnamon in it for flavor.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.597
Just trying something different.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.275
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.160
- Oh, did I wake you with the noise?
- No. No, not at all.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.712
- I totally did, didn't I?
- No, I was getting up...

04:44.880 --> 04:47.349
- Sorry. I got job interviews lined up.
- ...eventually.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.954
I wanted to get an early jump.

04:49.120 --> 04:52.397
I'm starting down south,
office manager interview in Polvadera...

04:52.600 --> 04:55.479
...then I'm working my way
up north to Algodones.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.313
I got a lot of ground to cover.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.479
Jimmy, you know,
you can take some time off.

05:01.040 --> 05:04.636
Nobody's gonna ding you for not having
a steady job right this minute.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.193
Why wait?

05:08.600 --> 05:11.354
I don't want unemployment
hanging over my head.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.319
And we could use
another paycheck, and...

05:15.240 --> 05:16.993
Besides, this is your office now.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.959
- I don't wanna be a distraction.
- You're not a distraction.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.555
That's right.
Because I'll be out finding me a job.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.790
Wish me luck.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.633
Good luck.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.709
Thai or Mexican?

05:28.880 --> 05:31.349
I'm gonna pick up dinner
on the way back.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.440
Either. Your choice.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.393
And what a choice it shall be.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.190
Yeah. Okay. Jimmy, wait. Are you...?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.198
You're not going to that meeting?

05:40.400 --> 05:44.838
No. If there's anything important,
Howard knows how to find me.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.440
It's just me.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
Papa.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.440
It's over.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.477
You can keep that.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.430
No one's coming for it.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.076
Mijo.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.275
And when is it over for you?

08:35.919 --> 08:37.957
I'm working on it.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.040
Hi.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.000
You see there, that's Alma,
and on the left is Ollie...

09:28.160 --> 09:29.560
...Mr. Neff's aunt and uncle.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.918
They started this company
almost 50 years ago.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.079
- Look at that.
- Yeah.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.391
And we think that other fellow
is Frank Corker.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.914
One of the early repairmen.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.834
They must've relied on him a lot.
That's a Thermo-Fax.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.835
It needed a specially-coated paper
to get an image off one of those babies.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.354
You know your stuff.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.519
I worked in a mail room,
so I talked to a lot of repairmen.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.751
A lot. They love talking shop.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.675
Yes. They are a lonely bunch, for sure.

09:57.240 --> 10:01.393
This one was a real big seller for Neff,
really put us on the map.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.553
That's a 6500 color copier.
That's a warhorse.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.270
You ever see the guts of this beast?
It takes 15 seconds to get a printout.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.956
- I worked with one back in Chicago.
- That machine was almost too good.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.158
Counterfeiters used it
to make phony $5 bills.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.789
- What? That's...
- Yeah.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.917
That's not right.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.837
Oh, look. You got a lot
of hardware over here.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.277
Yes, Mr. Neff loves
sponsoring the kids.

10:26.440 --> 10:30.150
- Bowling, that's fun.
- We had a pretty good run in the '90s...

10:30.320 --> 10:33.472
...but we don't find kids
much interested anymore.

10:33.640 --> 10:37.350
Yeah, this generation is all hacky sack
and video games.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.989
Ain't that the truth? Yeah.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.876
Hummels.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.396
Yes. Those were Alma's.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.110
She loved collecting the little things.
God rest her soul.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.557
Yeah, I knew a lady. Same way.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.474
Touring the wall of crap, I see.
I need to drag that stuff to the dumpster.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.518
Haven't had a chance
to motivate myself.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.871
- Mr. Neff, James McGill.
- Just "Jimmy" is fine.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.716
Jimmy. Pleasure.
Come on down, have a seat.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.550
Guessing Henry filled you in
on what we look for?

11:07.720 --> 11:08.995
He did indeed.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.879
Office-to-office salesman...

11:11.040 --> 11:13.635
...willing to have multiple doors
slammed in my face...

11:13.800 --> 11:15.234
...with one mission:

11:15.440 --> 11:17.272
Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade...

11:17.440 --> 11:20.239
...their old copiers
to your top-of-the-line new ones.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.914
You think you have the chops?

11:22.080 --> 11:25.471
- It's a lot harder than it sounds.
- I'd sure love a crack at it.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.632
I'm told stubbornness
and persuasiveness...

11:27.800 --> 11:29.871
...are two of my top qualities.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.311
I have to say,
he knows his way around a copier.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.119
No kidding.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.954
Well...

11:40.800 --> 11:43.269
Says here you were a lawyer...

11:44.800 --> 11:47.395
...up until not that long ago.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.032
What changed?

11:51.680 --> 11:55.560
Well, you know why God
made snakes before he made lawyers?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.916
He needed the practice.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.516
Needed the practice.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.273
- Yeah.
- Right?

12:01.440 --> 12:05.150
That's the only lawyer joke I know
because all the others are true stories.

12:05.320 --> 12:09.200
Look, I know you're looking for
somebody with sales experience...

12:09.360 --> 12:10.840
...and I don't have any.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.431
Except... Except being a lawyer.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.635
Look, being a lawyer,
my job was sales.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.038
I was selling to judges, juries
sometimes I was selling to clients...

12:21.200 --> 12:23.760
...to take the best deal
from a series of bad options.

12:23.920 --> 12:26.913
But every hour of every day,
I was convincing...

12:27.080 --> 12:29.549
...persuading, I was selling.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.677
I hear what you're saying.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.754
We have a lot of high-ticket items,
and a clientele primed to say no.

12:36.920 --> 12:41.790
Well, my spirit animal is a Gila monster,
and once I latch on, I don't let go.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.475
I like it, I like it.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.719
Well, you make a lot of
excellent points, Jimmy.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.315
I can see why Henry
wanted me to meet you.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.756
- Thank you for coming down.
- Absolutely. Anytime.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.953
We'll put our heads together,
have a decision in about a week.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.873
- We'll let you know then.
- Thank you.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.713
- You bet.
- Thanks. Great.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.672
- Yes?
- I'm sorry, can I have another minute?

13:30.840 --> 13:32.115
I'll be real quick.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.796
Yeah, sure, Jimmy.
What's on your mind?

13:36.000 --> 13:39.277
I know you're gonna take time,
consider your options...

13:39.440 --> 13:42.000
...but maybe we can
settle this right now.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.959
There's a thing that we all know
called opportunity cost.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.557
The time you spend looking for someone
is time I could be working for you.

13:48.760 --> 13:53.277
And sure, there are salesmen out there
with way more experience than me.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.717
What are the chances one will
walk through that door in the next week?

13:56.880 --> 13:59.076
And is it worth the wait?

13:59.240 --> 14:00.674
Maybe. Maybe.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.710
But I can tell you this:

14:03.880 --> 14:07.191
None of them will have the connection
to your machines that I do.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.589
None.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.399
I worked in the mail room.

14:10.560 --> 14:14.873
I know how important the copy machine is.
Deadlines, last-minute changes.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.276
I was in there, clearing paper jams.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.114
I was cleaning ink
off gears and rollers...

14:20.280 --> 14:23.956
...trying to figure out where
the mystery streaks were coming from.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.873
I was down on my hands and knees...

14:26.040 --> 14:28.680
...with my tie over my shoulder
and ink-stained hands...

14:28.840 --> 14:32.959
...and a line of assistants out the door,
all worried they're gonna lose their job...

14:33.120 --> 14:35.840
...if they don't get their document
the next five minutes.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.640
I know... I know better than anyone...

14:38.800 --> 14:43.079
...that the copier,
it's the beating heart of any business.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.631
It goes down, it causes delays,
that is lost money...

14:46.800 --> 14:49.952
...that is frustrated employees,
that's a negative work environment.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.430
That's a business on life support.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.355
But you plug one of your new machines
into the system...

14:57.280 --> 15:01.559
...that is a healthy, strong heartbeat.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.952
That is a healthy business.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.835
That is successful business.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.276
And that's what we're selling.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.113
One minute.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.954
- I don't need to see anymore.
- I mean, he's kind of exciting.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.512
He's great. The passion
that this gentleman has...

15:33.680 --> 15:36.559
- Can you imagine sending that guy out?
- Yeah. Come on.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.476
Jimmy.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.154
Welcome to the team.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.751
- Really?
- Damn right.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.634
Congrats. We'll get you set up
with Audrey in HR...

15:45.840 --> 15:49.231
...fill out your paperwork. Hopefully,
you'll be all set by end of day.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.080
So just like that, huh?

15:51.240 --> 15:53.197
Yep. Why wait
when we can get you rolling?

15:53.360 --> 15:57.240
You were gonna take some time,
consider your options...

15:57.400 --> 16:00.313
...but I just come in
and did that little song and dance...

16:00.760 --> 16:02.035
...and I'm in?

16:02.200 --> 16:04.715
Yeah. Right. That's right.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.675
Are you out of your mind?

16:10.040 --> 16:11.633
You don't know me.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.156
I just came in off the street.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.993
You guys are like a couple of cats.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.716
I come in, wave a shiny object around,
you're like, "I want that."

16:20.440 --> 16:22.796
No due diligence,
no background check.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.509
No. "Just hire the guy
that says them fancy words."

16:27.680 --> 16:31.515
I could be a serial killer. I could be
a guy who pees in your coffee pot.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.433
I could be both.

16:34.240 --> 16:38.234
- So you're not taking the job?
- No, I'm not taking the job.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.278
Suckers.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.676
I feel sorry for you.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.634
Hello. I'm wondering,
are you still interviewing...

17:28.800 --> 17:31.599
...for the sales associate position?

17:32.480 --> 17:36.520
Great. I can be there in 20 minutes.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.792
James McGill.

17:40.240 --> 17:45.110
Ellen, okay. Wonderful.
Well, thank you, Ellen. I'll see you soon.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.556
Pop-Pop, look how high I can go.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.757
Yeah, that's good.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.832
You be careful.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.798
You wanna do a couple more?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.634
Okay.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.399
Yeah?

18:27.600 --> 18:28.795
This is he.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.871
Meet at what time?

18:37.800 --> 18:40.998
Yeah, I can be there.
You let her know.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.679
Yeah.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.070
All right, baby.

18:46.240 --> 18:48.471
Time to get you back to your mama.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.994
Five more minutes?

18:50.160 --> 18:53.756
- Oh, honey, come on.
- Please?

18:54.240 --> 18:56.357
Five minutes.

18:56.520 --> 18:57.840
You're on the clock.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.912
Thank you.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.713
- Good afternoon.
- Yeah. Madrigal Electromotive?

19:30.880 --> 19:32.917
Down the hall,
the Sandia Room on your left.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.434
Thank you.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.914
Oh, good.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.713
Take a seat.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.276
You didn't come all this way
just for me.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.518
I frequently travel
to conference with distributors.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.514
Albuquerque is one of many stops.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.753
Okay.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.750
I'm just...

20:31.320 --> 20:33.551
...looking for an explanation.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.632
You steal an employee's badge...

20:35.800 --> 20:38.554
...waltz through my warehouse,
interfere with operations...

20:38.720 --> 20:41.599
...and strong-arm my facility manager.

20:41.800 --> 20:42.950
Why?

20:43.120 --> 20:45.840
I'm on your books
as a security consultant.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.994
If I show my face in your warehouse,
it makes for a better cover story.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.798
Anyone ever ask if I was there, I was.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.790
Plus, you had a few things that needed
correcting, so consider it a bonus.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.749
That's not the point.
This is meant to be a paper transaction.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.958
You sit at home and we pay you.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.873
Your own money.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.354
Doing what you did, the way you did it,
raises the threat of exposure.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.954
The way I see it, it lowers the threat.

21:15.120 --> 21:19.273
Like I said, now there's a face
to the name that cashes the check.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.153
So...

21:25.400 --> 21:27.278
...what's your plan, then?

21:27.880 --> 21:31.191
Madrigal has eight terminals
in the southwest.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.670
One down, seven to go.

21:38.200 --> 21:40.396
And if I asked you to reconsider?

21:40.560 --> 21:43.075
I'd ask you to do the same.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.398
At the moment,
you have Gus Fring's respect.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.555
I'd want to keep that if I were you.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.516
Hello. Hi.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.070
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Diseth...

22:46.240 --> 22:50.075
...this is Dr. Maureen Bruckner,
just arrived this morning.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.436
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Dr. Bruckner.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.314
Dr. Bruckner's visiting
from Johns Hopkins.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.951
We're asking her to take the lead
with some of the more severe cases...

22:59.120 --> 23:02.033
- ...including Mr. Salamanca.
- Johns Hopkins?

23:02.200 --> 23:05.910
Yes, a generous grant came through
which allowed Dr. Bruckner...

23:06.080 --> 23:08.879
- ...to lend us her expertise.
- Only temporarily.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.999
I'm not here to step on any toes.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.234
Okay, I...

23:15.400 --> 23:19.155
Our staff can help with the database
whenever you're ready to pull records...

23:19.320 --> 23:22.233
...but I'm available anytime
if you have any questions.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.393
Thank you. Again,
I don't wanna step on toes.

23:25.560 --> 23:29.110
- We can comanage care, if you like, we...
- No, no.

23:29.560 --> 23:32.917
- He's all yours. Good luck.
- Thank you.

23:35.160 --> 23:39.154
Okay. Well, I will let you get to it, then.

23:39.320 --> 23:42.438
Let us know if there's anything you need,
anything at all.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.829
Absolutely.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.400
Thank you.

23:45.560 --> 23:46.880
Are you the family?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.758
Are you the family?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.673
- Yes.
- Sons.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.120
He's our uncle.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.999
I want to let you know...

24:02.160 --> 24:05.710
...that your uncle has been getting
excellent care here at Lovelace.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.435
But we're going to try something
a little different.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.514
Look, when parts of the brain
are damaged by a stroke...

24:12.720 --> 24:14.951
...those parts, they cannot be repaired.

24:15.400 --> 24:19.235
Our job is to stimulate
your uncle's brain...

24:19.400 --> 24:21.471
...and teach it to rewire itself.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.310
We are going to start here
with the legs.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.197
When did they get here?

24:33.440 --> 24:36.478
Don't worry. We're still running things.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.160
Hello.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.319
Are you family as well?

24:44.480 --> 24:45.516
Friends of the family.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.114
Okay.

24:47.280 --> 24:48.839
As I was saying...

24:49.000 --> 24:51.959
...I'll return later with
an occupational therapist...

24:52.120 --> 24:55.397
...to begin some electrical stimulus.
In the meantime...

24:55.560 --> 24:57.995
...I'd ask that you speak to Hector.

24:58.640 --> 25:02.350
Chances are, on some level,
he can hear you.

25:02.560 --> 25:06.998
The more you speak, the more
his brain will work to respond...

25:07.160 --> 25:10.551
...and find pathways to connect.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.154
Okay? Good.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.634
We'll do everything we can
to help your uncle.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.110
Nice to meet you all.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.360
Speak.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.879
Don Hector.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.151
Everything is good out on the street.

26:05.440 --> 26:09.719
All our men are keeping busy.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.351
Real busy.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.679
That's right, Don Hector.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.760
We're staying on top of the count.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.000
It's all looking good.

26:24.840 --> 26:28.516
We had a problem with that
shit gang over on Lomas, but...

26:28.680 --> 26:30.876
...we showed some muscle.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.033
Took care of it.

26:33.680 --> 26:36.559
No one wants to mess
with the Salamancas.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.120
No one.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.352
You look good, Don Hector.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.959
Real good.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.520
The doctors, they're gonna fix you up.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.400
Yes.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.550
You're gonna get past this...

27:25.600 --> 27:28.593
...and be stronger than ever.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.111
- Yes?
<i>- It's me.</i>

28:02.320 --> 28:03.390
<i>Can we meet?</i>

28:03.560 --> 28:05.631
- Now is not a good time.
<i>- I'm in town.</i>

28:05.800 --> 28:08.269
I can easily meet
wherever's convenient.

28:08.440 --> 28:11.319
<i>Assume this is a secure line.</i>

28:12.280 --> 28:15.478
I spoke with your security contractor.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.599
I explained the situation again.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.520
But he's going to keep doing
what he's doing.

28:21.720 --> 28:23.552
<i>I understand.</i>

28:23.760 --> 28:27.390
But what he's doing makes no sense.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.434
- Do his reasons matter?
<i>- They do if he's unreliable.</i>

28:30.640 --> 28:32.120
He is reliable.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.430
So I'm just supposed to let him
keep stealing my employees' badges?

28:36.600 --> 28:38.512
<i>I don't know where he'll turn up next...</i>

28:38.680 --> 28:41.752
<i>...what disruption he'll cause,
what mess I'll have to clean up.</i>

28:42.080 --> 28:44.197
<i>This isn't something
I want to worry about.</i>

28:44.360 --> 28:47.194
Then I suggest you give
the man a badge.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.751
Varga and Salamanca's man, Colon,
they came by in the afternoon.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.519
Nephews were in his room all day.

28:58.680 --> 29:01.514
Bruckner saw him three times,
couple of specialists with her.

29:01.680 --> 29:03.990
They took him for a brain scan

29:04.800 --> 29:06.120
And?

29:06.840 --> 29:09.036
That's everything. No change.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.270
You want me back at the hospital?

29:58.560 --> 30:00.119
No.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.998
Call Victor.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.913
Have him meet us.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.318
Just a few more.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.914
I know Chuck was thorough...

31:10.080 --> 31:13.232
...but even I didn't think there was
gonna be this much paperwork.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.757
Having worked with him
as long as I did...

31:15.920 --> 31:19.357
...I was actually
pleasantly surprised by his restraint.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.550
This is the agreement for the transfer
of property, as discussed.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.313
If you can initial here.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.439
And right down here.

31:29.600 --> 31:32.320
- Am I late?
- Kim. No, right on time.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.879
We were just finishing up
Rebecca's side of things.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.275
Hi, Rebecca.

31:37.440 --> 31:39.477
It's nice to see you again

31:40.040 --> 31:43.272
I'm sorry we didn't get a chance
to talk more at the service.

31:43.440 --> 31:46.512
Oh, I don't think
anyone felt much like talking.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.072
- Jimmy's not coming?
- I'm here on his behalf.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.311
And that should do it.

31:52.480 --> 31:56.440
I apologize for bringing us
together so soon after Chuck's service.

31:56.640 --> 31:57.994
It's really my fault.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.117
Howard's being polite.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.714
Thank you, Julie.

32:03.320 --> 32:07.030
In any event, we thought
since Rebecca was still in town...

32:07.200 --> 32:09.920
...better to talk through
the estate in person.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.275
Sure.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.193
Chuck left the house to Rebecca...

32:13.360 --> 32:16.114
...and as executor,
I'll be liquidating the property.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.830
Howard suggested, and of course,
I agree, that it would be the right thing...

32:20.040 --> 32:23.431
...for Jimmy to go through whatever
survived and take whatever he wants.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.952
- I mean, anything with sentimental value.
- We can set up a time.

32:27.120 --> 32:30.670
The estate can provide a truck and
storage for anything he chooses to keep.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.075
That's okay.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.959
Jimmy doesn't want any of it.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.720
You sure?

32:35.880 --> 32:39.237
I think the garage is pretty intact,
except for some water damage.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.154
He doesn't want it. Thank you.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.840
Okay. I understand.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.672
Well, then...

32:49.840 --> 32:51.433
...as far as Jimmy's concerned...

32:51.600 --> 32:54.559
...all that's left is for him
to sign this agreement letter.

32:54.720 --> 32:59.192
Once that's done,
we can disperse his share of the estate.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.670
Let me guess. Four thousand?

33:03.760 --> 33:05.080
Five.

33:06.560 --> 33:10.270
It's what you give when you cut someone
from a will and not have it contested.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.797
Just enough money to show
the recipient wasn't forgotten.

33:14.320 --> 33:19.236
Chuck also left a substantial endowment
for a scholarship for deserving youth.

33:19.400 --> 33:23.110
I was hoping Jimmy would agree
to serve on the board.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.839
I'll let him know.

33:26.320 --> 33:27.959
What else?

33:28.120 --> 33:29.679
Well...

33:30.200 --> 33:32.954
...Chuck left Jimmy a personal letter.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.753
His eyes only.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.317
Howard, thank you for everything
that you've done.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.153
I know it's been difficult.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.880
It's hard on all of us.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.677
Well, I don't wanna keep you.
Let me walk you out.

33:56.840 --> 34:00.231
Actually, Howard,
we have a few more things to discuss.

34:01.800 --> 34:05.191
Kim, please give Jimmy my best.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.800
I will.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.077
It was very nice seeing you, Rebecca.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.799
You too.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.072
Safe travels.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.080
- Kim.
- I just...

34:26.679 --> 34:28.558
I just...

34:29.760 --> 34:31.831
...had to know...

34:32.000 --> 34:33.992
...what were you thinking?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.514
About?

34:36.719 --> 34:38.677
When you came to Jimmy...

34:38.840 --> 34:42.038
...on the day of his brother's funeral
and laid that shit on him?

34:42.199 --> 34:44.998
That Chuck killed himself?

34:45.679 --> 34:47.672
What's wrong with you?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.591
I thought...

34:53.120 --> 34:56.079
I thought I owed it to Jimmy to tell him.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.760
Owed it to him?

34:58.760 --> 35:00.877
Did you owe it to Rebecca?

35:01.040 --> 35:02.838
You tell her your theory?

35:03.000 --> 35:08.553
That Chuck intentionally
set himself on fire?

35:10.640 --> 35:11.710
I guess not.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.355
I guess you just
saved that one for Jimmy.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.193
Kim, I didn't do it to hurt Jimmy...

35:16.360 --> 35:19.432
- You did it to make yourself feel better.
- That's not what I was...

35:19.600 --> 35:23.196
To make yourself feel better
by unloading your guilt.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.512
Who cares what it does to Jimmy
as long as Howard Hamlin is okay.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.752
- Kim, I don't think that's fair...
- Fair?

35:29.920 --> 35:31.673
Let's talk about fair.

35:31.840 --> 35:35.197
"Hey, let's let Jimmy dig around
the fire-damaged wreck...

35:35.400 --> 35:37.835
...where his brother died screaming.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.957
Let's let him pick up a keepsake or two."

35:40.120 --> 35:44.433
That is so, so fair.
And did I hear you right?

35:44.600 --> 35:48.037
You want him to serve on the board
of a scholarship committee?

35:48.200 --> 35:50.795
A scholarship that Chuck
never in a million years...

35:51.000 --> 35:54.277
...would've given to Jimmy.
Never! It is just...

35:54.440 --> 35:57.592
I mean... Oh, what's this too, Howard?
What's in this?

35:57.800 --> 36:00.838
One last "screw you, little brother"
from beyond the grave?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.435
I'm really supposed to do this to him?

36:03.640 --> 36:05.393
All right. Kim.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.831
What can I do to make it better?

36:11.200 --> 36:12.873
Nothing.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.476
There is nothing you can do.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.432
Just stay away.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.400
Hey.

36:45.560 --> 36:48.394
I hope you're hungry.
I bought way too much food.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.159
Yeah. I can always eat.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.596
Counter or couch?

36:52.760 --> 36:54.717
- Couch is good.
- Couch it is.

36:55.480 --> 36:59.759
If I remember correctly, in five minutes,
one of the classic movie channels...

36:59.920 --> 37:02.913
...is showing <i>White Heat</i>
without interruption.

37:03.080 --> 37:06.073
The other is showing
<i>Jaws 3</i> with commercials.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.920
So a real <i>Sophie's Choice.</i>

37:09.120 --> 37:12.431
It is <i>Jaws 3-D,</i> to be exact.

37:13.760 --> 37:16.514
But Cagney wins this one.

37:16.680 --> 37:19.275
All right. Hey, I got us Thai iced teas...

37:19.440 --> 37:23.229
...unless you want me to pour you
something less non-alcoholic.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.517
No, I'm good with that.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.440
So how was the job search?

37:28.640 --> 37:30.233
Pretty good.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.198
I got a couple leads.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.397
Actually, I got an offer.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.193
- Really?
- Yeah...

37:36.360 --> 37:39.956
...but didn't feel quite right.

37:40.120 --> 37:41.839
It was...

37:42.200 --> 37:44.157
It just wasn't a perfect fit.

37:44.360 --> 37:48.639
But I think I might get a call back
on one or two of the others.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.032
Wow, that's a pretty good first day.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.999
You know, somebody's gonna
be lucky to get you.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.159
How was your day?

37:59.320 --> 38:03.360
I just mostly stayed here,
trying to get organized.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.799
No pressure from Paige and Kevin,
but I gotta get back on the horse, right?

38:08.200 --> 38:10.157
You are right.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.518
And movie's about to start.

38:13.680 --> 38:17.640
So where is the remote?

40:07.200 --> 40:10.398
<i>I'm not available at the moment.
Leave a message.</i>

40:10.560 --> 40:13.712
Hey, it's me.
Listen, I got something for you.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.473
It's a job.

40:15.680 --> 40:19.390
I think you're really gonna like this.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.758
So call me.

40:47.320 --> 40:49.357
We're taking six tonight.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.840
What?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.515
Six keys. It's what the boss would want.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.351
You're gonna back me up or what?

40:58.960 --> 41:00.519
Yeah.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.877
Where's the rest?

41:27.080 --> 41:29.197
I only see five.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.596
That was a one-time only.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.394
Not the way we see it.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.517
That's the way it is.

41:39.400 --> 41:42.074
Salamancas get six.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.197
We're not leaving without six.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.758
Your boss isn't giving orders.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.877
He can barely even open his eyes.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.871
I'm giving the orders

41:56.680 --> 41:58.637
Take the five or leave with nothing.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.358
Do you wanna go?

42:14.200 --> 42:15.839
You heard him.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.759
Six.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.077
Put it away.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.110
Do you really wanna do this?

42:59.760 --> 43:02.992
Yeah, that's what I thought.

43:33.920 --> 43:37.038
That's how you do it.
We had them pissing their pants.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.237
I know what you've done.

44:17.920 --> 44:20.151
The Salamancas...

44:20.320 --> 44:22.277
...they do not.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.871
Do you understand what I am saying?

44:34.320 --> 44:36.437
Look at me.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.991
From now on...

44:42.200 --> 44:46.399
...you are mine.
