01:38.002 --> 01:39.085
In a story so bizarre ... 

01:39.253 --> 01:41.713
... I can scarcely believe
the events I'm reporting ... 

01:41.881 --> 01:44.132
... and yet corroborated
by a dozen eyewitnesses ... 

01:44.300 --> 01:46.426
... a white male apparently fell
from the sky ... 

01:46.594 --> 01:48.470
... above downtown
Los Angeles today ... 

01:48.638 --> 01:50.931
... landed in the middle
of a busy intersection ... 

01:51.098 --> 01:54.142
... destroying one vehicle and 
hospitalizing its elderly driver ... 

01:54.310 --> 01:56.019
... and was removed from the scene ... 

01:56.187 --> 01:58.271
... before emergency personnel
could respond.

01:58.439 --> 02:01.775
Without a body, the police have yet
to piece together events of a day ... 

02:01.943 --> 02:04.778
... that can only be described
as implausible.

02:04.946 --> 02:07.447
Reports of a body
landing in the Boyle Heights area ... 

02:07.615 --> 02:10.241
... have yet to be confirmed,
and are being treated ... 

02:10.408 --> 02:12.410
... as the bullshit they most likely are.

04:31.425 --> 04:33.760
You big cock English.

04:33.928 --> 04:35.762
Strong like horse.

05:09.171 --> 05:10.922
Fuck that.

05:51.672 --> 05:53.673
That's not so bad.

06:33.881 --> 06:35.507
Nice.

06:47.895 --> 06:49.812
Pick up, Eve.

06:51.065 --> 06:53.274
The number you have reached
is not in service.

06:53.442 --> 06:54.776
Fuck.

06:57.029 --> 06:58.738
Shit.

07:02.368 --> 07:03.826
You lost?

07:04.745 --> 07:06.079
Nope.

08:11.562 --> 08:18.943
Shit.

08:24.908 --> 08:26.326
On your knees, Slim.

08:29.496 --> 08:31.039
Okay, Chow Mein.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.625
- Who do you work for?
- Fuck you, Chelios.

08:37.587 --> 08:39.505
Fucking grunt.

08:56.273 --> 08:59.192
You found me in quite an unpleasant
mood this morning, mate.

08:59.360 --> 09:02.362
Now, I'm gonna ask you this question
one time.

09:02.529 --> 09:05.865
Who's gots my fucking
strawberry tart?

09:10.079 --> 09:11.788
Capiche?

09:16.377 --> 09:18.461
Just spit the fucking name out.

09:18.629 --> 09:20.046
Johnny Vang!

09:20.214 --> 09:23.758
Johnny fucking Vang?
Johnny fucking Vang?

09:23.926 --> 09:26.594
- Good boy. Where?
- Cypress Social Club!

09:26.762 --> 09:29.722
Cypress -- Cypress Social Club.

09:29.890 --> 09:32.350
Now, you're sure about that, ain't you?

09:32.518 --> 09:34.560
Good boy. Thanks for coming.

09:34.728 --> 09:36.479
Now, you can keep that.

10:43.797 --> 10:45.131
Fuck.

11:00.814 --> 11:01.981
Hello. Doc Miles.

11:03.025 --> 11:04.066
Yeah, Doc, it's Chev.

11:05.486 --> 11:07.236
Jesus H. Chelios.

11:07.404 --> 11:08.654
You gotta be kidding me.

11:08.822 --> 11:10.698
Listen. I'm deadly
fucking serious, Doc.

11:10.866 --> 11:13.326
These Triad motherfuckers
cut out my fucking heart ... 

11:13.494 --> 11:15.495
... and put in one of those
artificial jobs.

11:15.662 --> 11:17.663
You got an artificial heart?

11:18.957 --> 11:20.917
You think I'm having a fucking laugh?

11:21.084 --> 11:23.336
No, but you gotta admit,
it's a little out there.

11:23.504 --> 11:26.923
- You take your fucking time, Doc.
- You don't have any time.

11:27.090 --> 11:30.426
They're not designed to keep you alive
more than a couple of days.

11:30.594 --> 11:33.513
- And don't do anything strenuous.
- Yeah, sure, Doc. No problem.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.139
So, what's my next fucking move?

11:35.307 --> 11:38.017
We gotta get a real heart put 
in you, preferably your own.

11:38.185 --> 11:39.727
- I'm on it.
- Okay, you're on it.

11:39.895 --> 11:42.855
- Doc, Jesus fucking Christ!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

11:43.023 --> 11:46.192
Let me -- Does that thing
have a belt battery pack?

11:46.360 --> 11:49.320
- Check.
- How many bars are showing?

11:50.155 --> 11:52.490
- One.
- Shit. That's better than none, I guess.

11:52.658 --> 11:56.285
Look, what they did you with is 
an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

11:58.539 --> 12:01.874
It's got an internal battery that'll
pick up once the belt battery dies.

12:02.042 --> 12:03.709
It's like a reserve tank.

12:03.877 --> 12:07.630
Once the internal battery takes over,
you got one fucking hour.

12:07.798 --> 12:09.715
The internal battery
charges wirelessly ... 

12:09.883 --> 12:12.468
... through a transcutaneous
energy-transfer system.

12:12.636 --> 12:15.471
Two coils --
There's one internal, one external.

12:15.639 --> 12:18.307
-- that transmit via a magnetic force
across the skin ... 

12:18.475 --> 12:20.476
... without piercing the surface.

12:20.644 --> 12:23.938
The internal coil receives power
and sends it to the controller device.

12:24.106 --> 12:26.691
Does this make any fucking sense
to you, Chevy?

12:26.859 --> 12:29.151
It's fucking Greek, Doc.

12:29.319 --> 12:31.195
Greek.

12:31.363 --> 12:33.865
Look, you gotta keep your body
electrically charged ... 

12:34.032 --> 12:36.576
... to keep that piece of shit pumping.
- Copy that.

12:36.743 --> 12:38.369
- Hey, Chev?
- Yeah.

12:38.537 --> 12:41.747
- I'm stoked you're alive, dude.
- I'll get back to you, Doc.

12:41.915 --> 12:42.999
Yeah. Call me.

12:45.544 --> 12:47.253
Fuck.

12:48.422 --> 12:50.423
Hey, hey, hey! That's a nice car.

12:50.591 --> 12:53.551
Don't suppose you know where
the "Cypress Social Club" is, do you?

12:53.719 --> 12:56.596
Man, fuck that shit, puto.
Let's race, ése.

12:57.806 --> 12:59.348
Don't you tempt me, fucker.

12:59.933 --> 13:01.934
What I need from you is directions.

13:28.211 --> 13:44.685
Shit.

13:57.991 --> 14:00.743
Damn, dog. You good, ése?

14:00.911 --> 14:03.579
Tiger fucking Woods.

14:03.997 --> 14:05.831
Never better.

14:06.166 --> 14:07.625
Greatest day of my fucking life.

14:13.006 --> 14:17.176
You couldn't point me in the direction
of the Cypress Social Club, could you?

14:17.344 --> 14:19.553
Well, you ain't too far.

14:19.721 --> 14:23.057
Go down Orange for, like, 2 miles,
and then you're there, homes.

14:27.270 --> 14:29.105
You mind giving me a jump?

14:37.280 --> 14:39.657
Just juice me.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.165
Anybody know
where's the fucking Social Club?

15:33.670 --> 15:36.255
¿Dónde está la Social Club?

15:42.971 --> 15:45.347
Buenos nachos, white boy.

15:49.978 --> 15:51.771
This is a fucking social club?

16:00.614 --> 16:02.615
You Johnny Vang?

16:43.490 --> 16:45.449
Go.

17:15.814 --> 17:17.982
- Get lost, bitch.
- Fuck you.

17:21.153 --> 17:22.987
- What?
- Where's Johnny Vang?

17:23.155 --> 17:24.989
You looking to get your ass killed?

17:27.284 --> 17:29.785
- Wrong expression.
- You ain't tapping my ass.

17:32.873 --> 17:35.124
There you go, cupcake.

17:39.462 --> 17:42.214
Fucking no balling
for me today, thanks.

17:43.884 --> 17:45.050
There goes my ride!

17:49.347 --> 17:50.890
What is that? Fucking cunt-o-nese?

17:52.142 --> 17:54.018
I'd rather stick my dick in a blender.

17:55.395 --> 17:57.062
Sticky me.

17:58.857 --> 18:00.065
Hey!

18:13.872 --> 18:15.331
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.

18:15.498 --> 18:16.582
Where?

18:27.260 --> 18:29.094
Hey, dude, why do you run?

18:29.262 --> 18:30.763
Wait for me!

18:32.515 --> 18:34.099
Get out of the fucking car!

18:36.853 --> 18:39.855
- Out!
- Get your own station wagon, asshole!

18:40.357 --> 18:42.441
Get the fuck off!

18:43.276 --> 18:44.777
Damn.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.279
Fuck.

18:48.114 --> 18:49.907
You taking it too fast with me.

18:50.075 --> 18:52.868
- Which way?
- I want you to take it slow.

18:53.036 --> 18:54.620
Which way?

18:58.458 --> 18:59.792
Hey! Hey.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.961
You didn't ask name.

19:03.964 --> 19:05.965
Shut up a minute, for fuck's sake.

19:06.716 --> 19:08.259
Where is he?

19:09.928 --> 19:11.303
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.266
Motherfucker!

19:25.026 --> 19:26.235
Baby.

19:47.340 --> 19:49.300
Motherfucking Chelios!

19:55.181 --> 19:56.473
You like sushi, Chinese man?

20:06.860 --> 20:09.361
How the fuck am I supposed to 
know what kind of "ese" you is ... 

20:09.529 --> 20:11.530
... you slanty-eyed fuck?

20:12.073 --> 20:13.532
Check it out.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.409
Sushi.

20:32.719 --> 20:34.553
Hey, Chico.

20:38.892 --> 20:40.517
We can make a deal, huh?

20:46.191 --> 20:48.275
Oh, yeah.

20:48.568 --> 20:50.402
Come on. Come on.

20:59.662 --> 21:01.246
My girl.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.502
Eve.

21:10.715 --> 21:12.049
Eve?

21:33.947 --> 21:35.447
Here, baby.

21:43.164 --> 21:44.957
Eve?

21:49.212 --> 21:50.921
Chev?

21:54.134 --> 21:57.302
Hey, I need you to take your
fucking hands off Lemon now, man.

21:57.470 --> 21:59.555
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?

21:59.722 --> 22:02.141
Who the fuck are you?
You know this guy, Lemon?

22:03.143 --> 22:04.143
Lemon.

22:05.437 --> 22:06.895
You were dead.

22:08.982 --> 22:09.982
I'm --

22:10.150 --> 22:12.276
I'm so confused right now.

22:12.444 --> 22:14.945
- What's that ticking sound?
- Yeah, what is that sound?

22:15.113 --> 22:18.115
You're kind of weird, tick-man.
It's time for you to go.

22:21.161 --> 22:23.162
- Randy?
- Randy?

22:23.329 --> 22:25.122
Come here.

22:46.644 --> 22:48.187
Not you. Babe, it's --

22:48.354 --> 22:49.480
Who the fuck is that?

22:50.106 --> 22:51.440
Some whore.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.067
Fuck, no. Fuck.

22:54.235 --> 22:57.112
- Look, she's helping me find my heart.
- What?

22:57.947 --> 22:59.448
Go away. Come on, let's go.

23:01.826 --> 23:02.868
Baby.

23:04.537 --> 23:05.704
What?

23:10.668 --> 23:12.878
Oh, you dozy cunt.

23:13.546 --> 23:14.922
Baby --

23:22.388 --> 23:24.223
No.

23:24.641 --> 23:26.225
We need his ass alive.

23:26.392 --> 23:29.561
Chev Chelios,
let's save some bullets, dude.

23:29.729 --> 23:31.730
Put that away.
We've all had a drink.

23:31.898 --> 23:33.023
Should I duck?

23:33.191 --> 23:34.858
Yeah.

24:33.042 --> 24:35.794
Shall we bypass the formalities?

24:35.962 --> 24:37.963
Of course.

24:38.131 --> 24:41.633
Who do you work for, and what
the fuck do they want with me?

24:41.801 --> 24:43.093
El Huron.

24:43.261 --> 24:46.388
English. Who's the fucking El Huton?

24:46.556 --> 24:48.599
It's The Ferret.

24:50.101 --> 24:54.313
He wants you alive,
so he can watch you die.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.315
Oh, yeah?

24:56.482 --> 24:58.984
- Why?
- I don't know.

24:59.485 --> 25:01.111
Doesn't everybody?

25:02.363 --> 25:04.031
Shut up.

25:04.991 --> 25:06.908
You lucky bastard.

25:15.335 --> 25:17.669
Eve, let's go.

25:32.435 --> 25:33.769
Get on the floor now!

25:39.359 --> 25:40.359
Turn around.

25:46.741 --> 25:47.783
Oh, it's on now.

25:47.950 --> 25:51.536
- No! Stop! Stop!
- Put her down.

26:04.676 --> 26:06.468
Stop it!

26:06.719 --> 26:07.803
No!

27:02.734 --> 27:04.109
Why didn't you call me?

27:04.277 --> 27:07.487
Like fuck I didn't.
Didn't you get my message?

27:10.450 --> 27:12.909
No. Where have you been
for the last three months?

27:13.077 --> 27:14.161
I thought you were dead.

27:14.328 --> 27:17.080
I fell a mile out of a helicopter,
that's all. True story.

27:17.248 --> 27:19.875
No way. You know what?
That's totally possible.

27:20.042 --> 27:21.626
I saw this video on YouTube ... 

27:21.794 --> 27:24.963
... where this guy's parachute doesn't
open, he falls 14,000 feet ... 

27:25.131 --> 27:26.256
... and he lives.

27:26.424 --> 27:30.343
Yes, baby, I know it's possible,
because I fucking did it!

27:30.511 --> 27:32.846
- Quit it.
- Since when were you on the Internet?

27:33.014 --> 27:35.140
A lot of things have changed
since you died.

27:35.308 --> 27:36.933
I didn't fucking die.

27:37.101 --> 27:40.103
Well, that's besides the point, isn't it?

27:40.271 --> 27:42.814
Hey!

27:50.490 --> 27:53.033
- Where are we going, Chev?
- I don't know.

27:53.201 --> 27:56.328
I need to find that slob from the club,
the one with the red cooler.

27:56.496 --> 27:58.580
Are you talking about Johnny Vang?

28:13.179 --> 28:15.764
- You know Johnny Vang?
- I know his ass.

28:15.932 --> 28:18.350
He's got the box with him all the time.

28:18.518 --> 28:20.101
That box, I need it.

28:20.269 --> 28:24.815
I can bet on my grandma's coochie
he's at the horse track.

28:27.527 --> 28:30.153
Dude, you gonna put Johnny Vang
on ice?

28:30.321 --> 28:34.032
- Maybe.
- That's so fucking sexy.

28:36.035 --> 28:39.037
- Fucking dead.
- Didn't they cuff you?

28:41.874 --> 28:43.625
Damn it. Do me.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.877
I'll do you.

28:49.048 --> 28:50.674
Bitch.

28:52.802 --> 28:55.220
Atta girl. I gotta call Doc.
I need that cell phone.

28:55.388 --> 28:58.390
Why didn't you just say it?
I have a cell phone.

28:59.183 --> 29:00.308
Here.

29:05.690 --> 29:07.649
You got a cell phone.

29:07.817 --> 29:10.151
I got you, okay?

29:10.319 --> 29:12.404
You gotta work for the things that --

29:12.572 --> 29:15.115
- Chevy?
- I lost the belt battery, Doc.

29:15.283 --> 29:16.992
- How long ago?
- Over an hour.

29:17.159 --> 29:20.245
Jesus Christ. That's not fucking
possible, Chevy. You should be d --

29:20.413 --> 29:21.872
Fuck it. Never mind. Look.

29:22.039 --> 29:25.458
It's a wireless system, so any low-level
electrical shock to your skin ... 

29:25.626 --> 29:27.711
... should juice it at least temporarily.

29:27.879 --> 29:29.880
Hey, Chev?
I'm a certified heart surgeon.

29:30.047 --> 29:31.506
Well, I was.

29:31.674 --> 29:34.134
Lost my license after I fucked up
my ex-wife's ... 

29:34.302 --> 29:36.052
... vaginal rejuvenation procedure.

29:36.220 --> 29:37.512
That's irrelevant right now.

29:37.680 --> 29:41.391
The point is, if you can get your heart,
I'm sure I can put it back in for you.

29:41.559 --> 29:45.520
I'll be in touch when I find that Chinese
cocksucker that's got me pump.

29:47.815 --> 29:49.608
Bet you even had
to choose between --

29:49.775 --> 29:51.443
Chinese.

29:51.944 --> 29:55.280
Sharon, I just shut down, okay?
I couldn't think. I couldn't feel.

29:55.448 --> 29:59.284
Hey, Chocolate? Would you get
off your fat ass and get dressed?

30:00.620 --> 30:02.370
Why?

30:04.457 --> 30:06.458
Is Doc Miles gonna
have to choke a bitch?

30:06.626 --> 30:10.086
You know that I was waiting
for those results too?

30:10.254 --> 30:14.049
- I needed to put things in perspective.
- Oh, you needed? You needed?

30:14.216 --> 30:16.927
I think I know who we're dealing with.

30:17.637 --> 30:19.429
Hell no, we won't blow.

30:19.597 --> 30:21.681
Hell no, we won't suck.

30:21.849 --> 30:24.017
Hell no, we won't blow.

30:24.185 --> 30:27.103
Hell no, we won't suck.

30:30.483 --> 30:33.568
Move! Jesus. Shit.

30:35.988 --> 30:37.155
What the fuck!

30:37.615 --> 30:38.657
Shit.

30:39.575 --> 30:41.409
That's right. You're gonna pay me!

30:41.577 --> 30:42.827
We want to make a living.

30:42.995 --> 30:45.830
You carry weapons,
we carry weapons in our pants.

30:45.998 --> 30:47.332
We're sick and tired of this.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.918
Pay me my fucking wages,
motherfuckers.

30:50.086 --> 30:51.795
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

30:51.963 --> 30:53.171
They need their money.

30:53.339 --> 30:57.842
You want me to fuck this car?

30:59.512 --> 31:01.596
- Suck my fucking tits.
- Get off the car.

31:02.848 --> 31:04.599
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back.

31:06.185 --> 31:07.352
- Hi.
- Give me my money.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.853
We're sick and tired of this.

31:09.021 --> 31:11.648
Just because it's porn doesn't 
mean we don't wanna do it.

31:11.816 --> 31:15.360
This is a weird scene. We've got
pissed-off beaver. I'm in pursuit.

31:31.836 --> 31:33.253
Cunt.

31:38.718 --> 31:39.801
Sit.

31:39.969 --> 31:41.511
Good --

31:42.972 --> 31:45.807
- I'm just making sure.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.

31:45.975 --> 31:47.809
Well, he's gotta know who's in charge.

31:47.977 --> 31:49.227
Dude, come on.

31:49.395 --> 31:51.688
- He's gonna eat somebody's baby --
- Chill.

31:51.856 --> 31:54.524
- You're gonna get sued.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.

31:54.692 --> 31:56.359
Whatever. I wanted a cat.

31:56.527 --> 31:57.986
Fuck.

32:02.950 --> 32:05.243
- See? Way better than a cat, man.
- Whatever.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.412
Who's this fucking asshole?

32:07.580 --> 32:10.081
You pair of sausage noodles.

32:10.249 --> 32:12.375
How do you sleep at night?

32:12.543 --> 32:15.253
I'm from PETA.
This is animal cruelty, you fuckers.

32:15.421 --> 32:18.256
- Give that back, you liberal freak.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:18.424 --> 32:20.925
- Fucking shame on you two. I tell you.
- That's $250.

32:21.093 --> 32:23.344
- Pair of cunts. Press the button.
- Take it back.

32:23.512 --> 32:25.055
- Hit him.
- Listen --

32:26.474 --> 32:28.183
- Disgusting.
- Morning.

32:28.350 --> 32:30.018
Mom would be so proud.

32:30.186 --> 32:32.771
- Sorry about that. Give me that thing.
- No.

32:34.857 --> 32:36.775
Yeah, there you go. Go on.

32:38.736 --> 32:40.779
You don't press that button,
you're going.

32:40.946 --> 32:43.114
- I'm pressing it.
- Press it!

32:44.200 --> 32:46.201
Come on, what's the matter?
Fucking wake up.

32:46.368 --> 32:49.079
- Make him press the button, you --
- Give him the fucking --

32:51.957 --> 32:54.209
- What are you, fucking useless?
- Hey!

32:54.668 --> 32:56.127
Stop right there!

32:58.964 --> 32:59.964
Oh, shit.

33:02.384 --> 33:03.760
See? He lost it. I told you.

33:09.892 --> 33:11.643
Get him off!

33:14.772 --> 33:16.898
Will our insurance cover that?

33:24.031 --> 33:25.323
- Get down!
- Cover your head!

33:25.491 --> 33:28.493
- On the ground!
- What the fuck is around your neck?

33:32.540 --> 33:34.082
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:39.171 --> 33:41.131
Kaylo?

33:41.924 --> 33:44.634
- Get on.
- Both of you down on the ground now!

33:53.561 --> 33:55.311
Kaylo, I thought you were dead.

33:55.479 --> 33:57.939
My name's Venus. I'm from Hollywood.

34:00.317 --> 34:01.359
Kaylo was my brother.

34:12.871 --> 34:15.290
Brother? No shit.

34:15.708 --> 34:17.750
Hey, what the fuck
did you hit me for anyway?

34:17.918 --> 34:21.545
I have a condition.
FBT, Full Body Tourette's.

34:21.714 --> 34:22.755
I can't control myself.

34:24.132 --> 34:26.009
Jesus! Fuck!

34:26.177 --> 34:28.386
God! What the --?

34:29.554 --> 34:32.223
Motherfuck.

34:34.310 --> 34:36.393
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry about your brother.

34:36.562 --> 34:38.855
I need to get to the
Hollywood Park racetrack ... 

34:39.023 --> 34:40.732
... and I mean right the fuck now.

34:45.237 --> 34:48.406
What's the matter,
you hurting or something?

34:53.746 --> 34:55.746
- Is that where they're at?
- Who?

34:55.915 --> 34:59.125
The sucker that killed my brother.
You're Chev "The Cheese" Chelios?

34:59.293 --> 35:02.420
The sickest motherfucker that ever
vaporized a motherfucker, right?

35:02.588 --> 35:06.966
- Yeah. That's me.
- Yeah. So when you get those suckers --

35:08.010 --> 35:10.678
Get a grip of yourself.
It's already done.

35:11.305 --> 35:12.597
It's done.

35:12.765 --> 35:15.725
I already took care
of the ones that did Kaylo.

35:16.268 --> 35:19.187
- But -- All of them?
- All of them.

35:19.355 --> 35:21.564
D-E-A-D. Brown Bread.

35:21.732 --> 35:23.858
- Right Said Fred?
- Simply Red.

35:24.026 --> 35:25.610
I see.

35:26.946 --> 35:28.279
Don't look so gloomy, Elvis.

35:28.447 --> 35:30.907
I can assure you
they did not die pleasantly.

35:31.075 --> 35:33.117
No. You don't understand.

35:33.285 --> 35:34.953
It's a matter of honor.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.789
It should have been me
to avenge my brother's death.

35:38.958 --> 35:40.959
Well, so long, Chelios.

35:42.378 --> 35:44.420
My brain hurts.

35:45.422 --> 35:48.883
There is one that I never got to,
on account of I could never find him.

35:49.051 --> 35:51.970
- The one that calls himself The Ferret.
- El Huron?

35:52.137 --> 35:54.180
- You know him?
- No.

35:54.348 --> 35:58.101
- That means "The Ferret" in Spanish.
- Right. Yeah, I knew that.

35:58.269 --> 36:01.771
Listen, you want to find the dude that
made your brother dead, you find him.

36:05.234 --> 36:06.985
Chev?

36:08.362 --> 36:10.405
Racetrack.

36:12.366 --> 36:14.158
You're here.

36:51.405 --> 36:52.447
That you, Chelios?

36:52.906 --> 36:56.451
- I'm running on empty, Doc.
- Same here, buddy.

36:56.618 --> 36:58.870
I'm gonna need to stick my dick
in a socket.

36:59.038 --> 37:03.207
- I don't recommend that. But friction --
- Friction?

37:03.375 --> 37:06.711
Yeah. Skin-on-skin contact
creates static electricity.

37:06.879 --> 37:08.129
You're kidding me, right?

37:08.297 --> 37:12.717
Dude, the friction of two like objects
causes a transfer of electrons.

37:12.885 --> 37:14.886
Science 101, Chevy.

37:15.054 --> 37:17.972
Probably ditched that class. I did.

37:18.557 --> 37:22.018
Find someone to rub against.
It's gonna help.

37:22.186 --> 37:23.853
Well, it's not gonna hurt.

37:29.401 --> 37:31.569
Terrific race.

37:33.405 --> 37:35.406
That's a great horse, mate.

37:36.742 --> 37:38.409
What the fuck, man?

37:38.911 --> 37:40.578
- What the fuck?
- You did it.

37:41.997 --> 37:44.123
Mate, that was all you.

37:55.761 --> 37:57.428
Yo, man.

38:03.936 --> 38:05.895
Fucking Doc.

38:11.527 --> 38:14.404
Hey there, mister.
Somebody stop him! Stop him.

38:14.571 --> 38:15.613
- Chev.
- No!

38:19.076 --> 38:20.952
The horse! The horse!

38:21.120 --> 38:22.245
Get out of there!

38:23.372 --> 38:24.956
Please.

38:35.259 --> 38:37.969
Hey. Wait, wait. Chill out.
He's just had too many drinks.

38:38.137 --> 38:40.096
I got him. Okay?
Go about your business.

38:40.264 --> 38:42.140
- All right.
- Honey, let's go.

38:42.307 --> 38:44.142
- My heart.
- Oh, I love you too.

38:45.310 --> 38:47.895
Honey, come on. Over here.

38:49.648 --> 38:51.065
Are you okay?

38:51.233 --> 38:53.067
Is it the Chinese poison?

38:53.735 --> 38:55.486
Friction.

38:57.406 --> 39:00.616
Doc said friction.

39:07.249 --> 39:09.000
Chev.

39:10.836 --> 39:12.336
Friction.

39:14.631 --> 39:16.340
Friction?

39:19.386 --> 39:21.846
- I'll give you friction.
- Yeah.

39:22.014 --> 39:23.181
Yeah.

39:24.266 --> 39:26.809
- Babe, what are you doing?
- I know how this game works.

39:27.394 --> 39:29.353
- Oh, yeah. It's working, baby.
- Okay.

39:29.521 --> 39:30.813
Yeah. Fuck.

39:32.441 --> 39:34.192
Keep going, doll.

39:34.359 --> 39:35.526
Rub it, baby.

39:35.694 --> 39:37.695
- Yeah, rub it.
- Fucking good.

39:37.863 --> 39:39.322
Rub it!

39:42.367 --> 39:44.494
- Oh, my God. It's gross.
- Hey!

39:44.661 --> 39:45.870
No.

39:57.633 --> 39:59.800
Oh, baby.

40:05.849 --> 40:07.350
Fuck, it's working, Eve.

40:07.518 --> 40:09.852
Oh, smash it fucking good, babe.
Come on.

40:12.689 --> 40:15.233
Come on, you motherfucker.

40:15.400 --> 40:17.151
You fucking nailed it, Doc.

40:17.319 --> 40:18.819
You fucking got it, doctor!

40:18.987 --> 40:20.696
- I got it!
- Come on, doctor!

40:27.746 --> 40:29.872
Come on, babe, let's switch.

40:43.095 --> 40:44.595
Give the kitty some cream, baby.

40:45.097 --> 40:47.890
Give the kitty some more cream.
Move your --

40:50.269 --> 40:51.269
Fucking it!

40:59.528 --> 41:02.113
I fucking love you. I love you so much.

41:50.329 --> 41:51.329
Eve.

41:51.496 --> 41:53.414
Stop!

42:18.357 --> 42:19.607
Yo, help us out, man!

42:22.402 --> 42:24.195
Door number 6.

42:26.156 --> 42:27.531
Come on, man!

42:39.878 --> 42:41.379
Fucking useless.

42:41.546 --> 42:42.922
Yeah?

42:43.090 --> 42:46.133
Well, you ain't no
'Ralph Macchio' yourself, Chev!

43:08.365 --> 43:10.241
Go!

43:25.173 --> 43:27.591
Oh, fuck!

43:30.178 --> 43:32.513
Did I drop some change,
or did I hear a chink?

43:32.681 --> 43:34.682
Oh, my God!

43:34.850 --> 43:36.934
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck me?

43:37.602 --> 43:39.520
Give me the fucking box!

43:44.776 --> 43:46.861
Fuck you, Chelios!

44:03.462 --> 44:04.462
Get in.

44:16.308 --> 44:19.643
- Chev Chelios.
- Don motherfucking Kim.

44:19.811 --> 44:23.147
So you pull my lily-white ass
out of the hot grease again.

44:26.651 --> 44:28.903
Please, don't thank me.

44:29.863 --> 44:33.115
I don't think I shall. I'm not sure
if you're aware of this, Jeeves ... 

44:33.283 --> 44:36.160
... but your slant-eyed associates
have taken something ... 

44:36.328 --> 44:37.787
... of extreme value to me.

44:37.954 --> 44:39.663
And I intend to get it back.

44:39.831 --> 44:41.499
You know what you are,
Chev Chelios?

44:42.083 --> 44:43.334
Tell me.

44:43.502 --> 44:47.671
You are a shit magnet.

45:06.191 --> 45:09.860
Your friend has the gay condition.

45:11.696 --> 45:14.031
And now, where were we?

45:14.199 --> 45:17.827
You were about to tell me
exactly who's got what I need and why.

45:17.994 --> 45:21.288
You may have heard
of the name Poon Dong.

45:23.458 --> 45:27.044
- Only in dirty limericks.
- The patriarch of our organization.

45:27.212 --> 45:29.338
Said to be 100 years old.

45:29.506 --> 45:33.008
Considered to be more god than man
by the Triad gangs.

45:33.176 --> 45:35.302
But several months ago,
word had spread out ... 

45:35.470 --> 45:37.888
... that Poon Dong
had taken gravely ill.

45:38.056 --> 45:41.559
And without a heart transplant,
he only had a few days left to live.

45:47.858 --> 45:50.734
- I see.
- Of course, that was unacceptable.

45:50.902 --> 45:52.653
Many would have given their hearts ... 

45:52.821 --> 45:56.031
... from their own breasts
to save the life of Poon Dong.

45:56.199 --> 45:58.492
But not me. Fuck that.

45:58.660 --> 45:59.702
But many.

45:59.870 --> 46:02.079
Then word spread out
that there was a man ... 

46:02.247 --> 46:04.665
... who had a heart so powerful
that he was capable ... 

46:04.833 --> 46:09.044
... of surviving even our most deadliest
of poisons.

46:13.133 --> 46:16.176
- The Chinese shit.
- Yes.

46:16.344 --> 46:19.013
It was you, Chev Chelios.

46:19.180 --> 46:23.517
It was your heart that Poon Dong
chose to replace his own.

46:24.311 --> 46:25.769
One more question.

46:25.937 --> 46:29.231
Who the fuck is El Huron, The Ferret?

46:29.399 --> 46:31.567
And how is he involved with all this?

46:31.735 --> 46:33.527
The Ferret?

46:41.328 --> 46:47.249
Let's just say our organizations
have a history of conflicting interests.

46:47.417 --> 46:49.293
I see.

46:49.502 --> 46:52.129
Well, it's mighty white of you
to help me out like this.

46:52.297 --> 46:53.714
Now, if you don't mind.

46:53.882 --> 46:55.341
Who said I was helping you out?

46:55.508 --> 47:00.304
My reward for returning you
to Poon Dong will be great.

47:00.472 --> 47:06.393
- So this is how it is.
- This is how it is.

47:34.839 --> 47:37.758
Chicken and broccoli.

48:24.222 --> 48:27.391
- Dude, are you all right?
- Never better.

48:34.691 --> 48:37.693
Fish Halman here, bringing you
breaking on-the-scenes coverage ... 

48:37.861 --> 48:40.154
... of an explosion of mayhem,
and lewd behavior ... 

48:40.321 --> 48:42.239
... that has swept the Long Beach area.

48:42.407 --> 48:45.075
Our viewers may remember
a similar series of incidents ... 

48:45.243 --> 48:47.077
... which took place
three months back ... 

48:47.245 --> 48:49.830
... involving this unidentified man.

48:49.998 --> 48:52.207
Police are now confirming
that today's events ... 

48:52.375 --> 48:55.502
... are the work
of that very same psychotic deviant.

48:55.670 --> 48:58.672
Ted Garcia is standing by
in Hollywood Park with a live report.

48:58.840 --> 49:00.632
- Take it away, Ted.
- Thanks, Fish.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.718
I'm standing here
with a group of people --

49:02.886 --> 49:05.554
Families, seniors,
and degenerate gamblers.

49:05.722 --> 49:09.141
-- that are shocked and traumatized by
what they've witnessed here today ... 

49:09.309 --> 49:12.311
... when what started as a sunny,
Southern California afternoon ... 

49:12.479 --> 49:17.357
... at the races turned, without warning,
into a public, open-air porno.

49:17.525 --> 49:19.026
Did you say porno, Ted?

49:19.194 --> 49:20.402
Straight up, Fish.

49:20.570 --> 49:23.322
I'd like you to meet Glenda Lansing
of Hawaiian Gardens.

49:23.490 --> 49:26.909
Glenda says she had an all-too-
up-close-and-personal encounter ... 

49:27.077 --> 49:30.704
... with the suspect just moments
before the shocking incident occurred.

49:31.164 --> 49:34.708
That bastard had his filthy hands
all over me.

49:34.876 --> 49:36.752
Can you describe exactly
what happened?

49:36.920 --> 49:40.214
I never saw a bastard
who wanted it so bad.

49:40.381 --> 49:43.967
He put his filthy hands
on every part of me.

49:44.135 --> 49:47.012
Okay, that's a little too much
information for this broadcast.

49:47.180 --> 49:49.181
Can you describe
the man that assaulted you?

49:49.349 --> 49:51.767
He looked like that fella
from the movies.

49:52.477 --> 49:53.811
The T-Bag.

49:53.978 --> 49:55.270
T-Bag?

49:55.438 --> 49:58.482
You know, the Train-spotted fella?

49:58.650 --> 50:01.151
- Built like a brick shit house.
- All right, ma'am.

50:01.319 --> 50:04.279
You know that kind of language
is not gonna fly on TV.

50:05.115 --> 50:06.657
That son of a bitch.

50:06.825 --> 50:10.119
He treated me like his hot little whore.

50:11.162 --> 50:13.497
Explain to me ... 

50:14.040 --> 50:18.752
... how you let this motherfucker
get away.

50:19.546 --> 50:22.673
He just went buck wild
and killed everybody.

50:22.841 --> 50:24.091
But not you.

50:25.677 --> 50:26.677
I just got lucky, eh?

50:30.098 --> 50:31.515
You know the drill, bitch.

50:40.441 --> 50:41.483
Do it.

50:50.201 --> 50:51.702
Do it!

51:07.635 --> 51:10.637
Now the other one.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.585
You got yourself another chance.

51:42.045 --> 51:44.588
I don't think you'll fuck it up next time.

51:44.756 --> 51:47.799
Now go get yourself a Band-Aid.

51:47.967 --> 51:50.219
And go get me
fucking Chelios, cabron!

52:09.072 --> 52:11.740
That's the last time.
The last time that son of a bitch ... 

52:11.908 --> 52:14.868
... leaves me with my ass in the wind
in front of 8,000 people!

52:18.539 --> 52:20.249
- Lemon. Hey, hey, hey!
- Randy?

52:20.416 --> 52:21.750
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

52:21.918 --> 52:23.293
It's about the dude.

52:23.461 --> 52:24.461
What dude?

52:24.629 --> 52:26.129
- The asshole.
- What about him?

52:26.297 --> 52:29.549
He's on every channel. The guy's
a fucking psycho killer, baby.

52:29.717 --> 52:33.303
Every cop in this city's looking for him,
not to mention the fucking beaners.

52:33.471 --> 52:35.138
- The fucking Orientals.
- So?

52:35.306 --> 52:37.599
So? So?
So the heat's on the street ... 

52:37.767 --> 52:39.726
... and that dude's
playing for keeps, baby.

52:39.894 --> 52:42.145
I have no idea
what the hell you just said.

52:42.313 --> 52:44.314
- Look. Lemon. Lemon, look.
- What?

52:44.482 --> 52:48.026
I know we've all been down our
dark roads in the past, okay, babe?

52:49.112 --> 52:52.614
I need my hair did, my nails did.
You ain't gave me no money.

52:52.782 --> 52:54.449
Where you been at, Randy?

52:54.617 --> 52:56.576
If I ever catch you with another bitch ...

52:56.744 --> 52:58.996
Well, you do got a big-ass dick
for a white boy.

53:01.874 --> 53:05.627
Anyway, look, the point is,
you're my lady now, all right?

53:05.795 --> 53:08.505
I don't think it's safe
for you to be out there with that --

53:08.673 --> 53:11.675
That sick fucko running wild right now.

53:11.843 --> 53:13.510
- You can say that again.
- Look, look.

53:13.678 --> 53:15.971
Listen to me.
Here's what I think we should do.

53:16.139 --> 53:18.932
- What, Randy?
- All right, I say we go to the fuzz.

53:19.100 --> 53:20.851
We tell them everything.
We come clean.

53:21.019 --> 53:22.894
- What?
- The fuzz, all right?

53:23.062 --> 53:26.356
I mean, I'd kill this guy myself,
but I got two strikes against me.

53:27.066 --> 53:28.483
- Let go of me.
- Look, baby.

53:28.651 --> 53:32.029
All right? I'm trying to be cool to you,
but I will drop the hammer.

53:32.196 --> 53:34.197
You want me to drop the hammer,
baby?

53:42.206 --> 53:44.791
I'm in no mood today, Randy!

53:48.921 --> 53:49.963
Lemon!

54:02.852 --> 54:04.561
Freeze!

54:04.729 --> 54:05.771
Hey!

54:05.938 --> 54:07.564
Now, spread it.

54:09.067 --> 54:10.901
All right, let's go.

54:13.321 --> 54:15.072
Against the car.

54:40.890 --> 54:42.432
Don't leave no skid marks, nigga.

54:44.185 --> 54:46.853
- Work that ass, baby.
- Ride that shit, big sexy!

54:47.021 --> 54:48.105
Put your arm up, son.

54:48.272 --> 54:50.065
Eight seconds, nigga! Yeah.

54:50.233 --> 54:52.109
Oh, my God.

54:52.276 --> 54:53.777
- Hello.
- Orlando?

54:53.945 --> 54:56.696
Venus! What is up, my man?

54:56.864 --> 54:59.116
Where you been, man?
I ain't seen your ass since --

54:59.283 --> 55:02.869
We was all of us broken up about what
happened to your brother. You okay?

55:03.037 --> 55:05.038
- Orlando, I need your help.
- Venus, come on.

55:05.206 --> 55:06.790
You my nigga. Can't get no bigger.

55:06.958 --> 55:09.334
L.A. Underground,
we're like a family, man.

55:09.502 --> 55:11.753
We a freak-ass family,
but we family, all right?

55:11.921 --> 55:15.715
- We look out for our own. What?
- I'm looking for a man called The Ferret.

55:15.883 --> 55:17.926
El Huron.

55:18.594 --> 55:20.011
Shit.

55:20.179 --> 55:21.680
Ferret?

55:29.313 --> 55:30.313
Oh, great.

55:33.860 --> 55:35.944
Hydrated, man! Keep him hydrated!

55:36.112 --> 55:38.822
- Step on it!
- Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in.

55:40.741 --> 55:42.117
Fuck.

55:42.285 --> 55:43.994
This is an ambulance, you fuckhead!

55:46.581 --> 55:48.165
Keep hydrating those organs!

55:48.332 --> 55:49.833
- Hold it in!
- Jesus.

55:50.001 --> 55:51.835
What are you doing?
This is an ambulance!

55:52.003 --> 55:55.672
Right, motherfucker. I'm aware of that.
I'm in need of emergency services.

55:55.840 --> 55:58.258
Yeah, we have got a guy
in the back of the ambulance!

55:58.426 --> 55:59.801
Get him out of here, man.

55:59.969 --> 56:03.096
- That's one of Don Kim's blokes.
- This man is in critical condition.

56:03.264 --> 56:04.973
- Get out of here.
- I'm aware of that.

56:05.141 --> 56:06.725
I'm the fucker that put him there.

56:06.893 --> 56:08.977
- Now ...
- Okay, he's got a gun!

56:09.770 --> 56:11.021
- You're my physician.
- Okay.

56:11.189 --> 56:14.191
I'm in need of an external lithium
battery belt ... 

56:14.358 --> 56:17.527
... for an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

56:17.695 --> 56:20.363
- Might you have such a thing?
- We're gonna lose it, Bronc.

56:20.531 --> 56:24.034
- Please, look, this guy is fucking dying.
- Don't worry about him.

56:24.202 --> 56:26.036
He's not gonna make it.

56:26.204 --> 56:30.916
- Now, about my battery.
- Yeah, you said the Avicor TAH.

56:31.083 --> 56:32.792
Yeah, we got it. But why?

56:37.215 --> 56:38.715
- Holy shit.
- Chop, chop.

56:38.883 --> 56:40.884
Okay.

56:44.138 --> 56:47.182
- He's fucking dead, man.
- Do you mind?

56:53.898 --> 56:55.774
- You ready for this shit?
- Do it then.

56:55.942 --> 56:57.150
Turn the fucking thing on.

57:03.741 --> 57:07.160
Feels like crack.

57:07.328 --> 57:08.370
Yeah, but better.

57:08.538 --> 57:11.414
You know, those things aren't 
designed for strenuous activity.

57:11.582 --> 57:13.542
Tell me about it.

57:19.382 --> 57:22.384
- Stop the fucking ambulance!
- Dude, we got to go to the hospital.

57:22.552 --> 57:23.885
Fuck!

57:34.021 --> 57:36.022
Bing fucking Crosby.

57:39.944 --> 57:42.988
Breathe out. Raise your buttocks
upward by first walking --

57:43.155 --> 57:44.906
Come on, down with that doggie.

57:45.074 --> 57:46.950
Down dog --

57:47.118 --> 57:48.868
- Hello.
- Doc, I'm close.

57:49.036 --> 57:50.870
So am I.
Chev, can this wait a second?

57:51.038 --> 57:53.873
I think I've found that motherfucker
that's got my organ.

57:54.041 --> 57:57.544
I think I got the skinny on that Triad
geezer from my girls on the street.

57:57.712 --> 58:00.130
Old news. I'll get back to you
when I have the tart.

58:00.298 --> 58:02.132
Chevy, wait!

58:09.098 --> 58:11.641
Chev Chelios!

58:23.988 --> 58:25.655
Fucking clowns.

58:53.851 --> 58:55.352
Cunt!

58:57.980 --> 59:00.398
It's completely normal
to be freaked out ... 

59:00.566 --> 59:02.359
... when someone has a gun
at your head.

59:02.526 --> 59:05.278
- I would have shit myself.
- I still have nightmares.

59:05.446 --> 59:07.280
Everybody has nightmares.

59:07.448 --> 59:10.492
The point is, by coming here
and talking with me ... 

59:10.660 --> 59:15.205
... you made a choice
to confront your issues and lick them.

59:15.373 --> 59:17.374
I can't even leave
my fucking apartment. I --

59:17.541 --> 59:21.711
Every time I go up to leave the door,
I see the guy with the gun.

59:21.879 --> 59:23.963
- I'm having a really bad day.
- Oh, shit.

59:24.131 --> 59:26.925
Tell me you got epinephrine
in this fucking cart.

59:27.093 --> 59:29.094
Think about it like this, Engleson.

59:29.261 --> 59:32.806
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

59:32.973 --> 59:35.225
You gotta go out and enjoy it.

59:35.393 --> 59:38.895
Knock back a couple of beers,
hit a titty bar.

59:40.022 --> 59:42.565
- Excuse me?
- Have some smelly snatch rubbed ... 

59:42.733 --> 59:44.984
... in your face.
You gotta get out there, man.

59:45.152 --> 59:47.112
Yeah. I've gotta do it.

59:47.780 --> 59:49.406
I'm gonna go and tackle the world.

59:49.573 --> 59:51.408
No, don't tackle the world.

59:51.575 --> 59:53.993
Tackle a fucking whore.
Get your dick wet.

59:54.161 --> 59:57.372
- Yeah.
- Dip your wick into life a little bit.

59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.208
- Have some fun.
- Yeah.

01:00:00.376 --> 01:00:03.586
I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna
floss my teeth with some pubes.

01:00:03.754 --> 01:00:05.880
- Oh, now you're on it.
- Thanks, doctor.

01:00:06.048 --> 01:00:08.383
- Oh, my pleasure.
- No, no, no.

01:00:08.551 --> 01:00:10.760
The pleasure's all mine.

01:00:10.928 --> 01:00:12.470
I'm done with fear.

01:00:12.638 --> 01:00:14.848
My life begins today.

01:00:25.943 --> 01:00:27.861
Fuck!

01:02:54.675 --> 01:02:56.676
Hey, maybe we better call 911.

01:03:05.436 --> 01:03:07.437
Where's my box?

01:03:25.456 --> 01:03:29.292
Five more like that, and your brains
will be strawberry jelly.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.378
You can't look in that box!

01:03:32.546 --> 01:03:34.964
The key and the fucking combo.

01:03:35.132 --> 01:03:36.466
No!

01:03:36.634 --> 01:03:38.051
Do it.

01:03:47.436 --> 01:03:48.811
That's better.

01:03:57.196 --> 01:03:59.614
This isn't my fucking pumper!

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.243
What is that?

01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:08.498
What kind of sick freak carries
something like this around in a box?

01:04:11.293 --> 01:04:13.461
I am shocked to my fucking core.

01:04:13.629 --> 01:04:16.339
You've got some deep problems,
motherfucker.

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:21.260
What the fuck is that?

01:04:33.649 --> 01:04:36.192
Fucking gotta come back
and fucking gotta find out ... 

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.694
... what the fuck is this?

01:04:37.861 --> 01:04:39.696
What the fuck is --?

01:04:41.073 --> 01:04:42.448
- Hello.
- Doc.

01:04:42.616 --> 01:04:46.035
When you hung up on me, I was trying
to fucking tell you something.

01:04:46.203 --> 01:04:48.204
Your heart was transplanted
three weeks ago ... 

01:04:48.372 --> 01:04:49.872
... into that Shaolin motherfucker.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.042
- Fucking great. Now what?
- I'm on it.

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:55.461
Poon Dong is still in L.A.
And if I'm right ... 

01:04:55.629 --> 01:04:58.381
... he's got what you need in 
pristine, working condition ... 

01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:59.841
... beating inside his chest.

01:05:00.009 --> 01:05:02.552
- Good. Where do I find him?
- Don't worry about it.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.053
I got people on the street.

01:05:19.945 --> 01:05:23.031
Good luck with that, Doc.
I'll try it my way.

01:05:24.074 --> 01:05:25.533
Come here, you.

01:05:25.701 --> 01:05:27.076
Up you get.

01:05:27.995 --> 01:05:31.873
Okay, darling, one last dance.

01:05:32.332 --> 01:05:33.666
Where's the fucking old man?

01:05:48.265 --> 01:05:49.432
What old man?

01:05:56.899 --> 01:06:00.777
Hey. Hey. I got 5 dollars that 
says you blow me for 20 bucks.

01:06:09.036 --> 01:06:11.788
Oh, stop. Stop right here.
Stop right here.

01:06:11.955 --> 01:06:13.372
Hey, baby.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.957
Hey.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:18.669
- Hey, baby. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay, baby.

01:06:18.837 --> 01:06:20.046
- Yeah?
- How you doing?

01:06:20.214 --> 01:06:21.464
What you need?

01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:24.801
You know what I need.

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:28.805
Come on. Come on, Daddy.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.312
Fuck you, Chelios.

01:06:56.667 --> 01:06:59.127
Tell me what he's like
when he's at home.

01:06:59.294 --> 01:07:01.629
When he's home, he's like a ghost.

01:07:01.797 --> 01:07:04.674
He just plays those video games
all day, all night.

01:07:05.467 --> 01:07:07.009
- Video games?
- All day.

01:07:07.177 --> 01:07:08.344
And you let him do that?

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.432
I mean, you did buy the games
for him, yeah?

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:14.892
Of course.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.978
Why should I deny my son?

01:07:17.146 --> 01:07:20.064
- How are you today, Chev?
- I'm golden, sir.

01:07:20.232 --> 01:07:24.026
Your mom tells me that you've been 
getting into quite a bit of trouble.

01:07:24.194 --> 01:07:26.279
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:26.446 --> 01:07:29.615
- Regretfully, that's true.
- What kind of trouble?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.162
Fighting, talking back, pinching.

01:07:34.329 --> 01:07:35.538
Pinching what?

01:07:35.706 --> 01:07:39.542
Televisions, stereo components,
books from the library.

01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:42.044
- That's not all.
- No, sir.

01:07:42.212 --> 01:07:45.173
Also a till from a restaurant
and one car.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.675
- A toy car?
- No, sir.

01:07:47.843 --> 01:07:49.343
A BMW Z1.

01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:52.972
Hey, sit.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:55.141
People, people, all right.

01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:58.686
I hear you've been having
quite a bit of trouble at school too.

01:08:03.817 --> 01:08:05.526
Chelios.

01:08:11.116 --> 01:08:13.201
Nothing I can't handle, sir.

01:08:13.744 --> 01:08:16.162
- I have a lot of piss and vinegar.
- He's hyperactive.

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:17.371
Oh, shit, Mom.

01:08:17.538 --> 01:08:19.665
You want to watch your
dirty little mouth, son.

01:08:19.832 --> 01:08:22.001
- We tried giving him Ritalin, but --
- Chev?

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.920
I sold it.

01:08:24.087 --> 01:08:26.546
With all this energy,
you've never thought about ... 

01:08:26.715 --> 01:08:28.716
... I don't know, trying out for sports?

01:08:41.854 --> 01:08:44.941
- I like to run.
- Chev, where's Dad?

01:08:45.524 --> 01:08:48.653
I never met the wanker.
He died before I was born.

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:53.282
What do you think he'd say if 
he saw you acting out like this?

01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:54.533
Don't know, sir.

01:08:54.701 --> 01:08:58.120
If he were here now,
and he asked you:

01:08:58.287 --> 01:09:01.290
"Why the bloody hell do you 
do the things you do, son?"

01:09:01.457 --> 01:09:04.292
- What would you tell him?
- Don't know, sir.

01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:06.796
- Bored, I guess.
- Bored, he guesses.

01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:08.965
- Bored? Bored?
- Shut up.

01:09:09.131 --> 01:09:10.925
We're gonna take a short break now.

01:09:11.093 --> 01:09:13.719
And when we return,
we are gonna find out ... 

01:09:15.138 --> 01:09:19.475
... what makes you tick, little man.

01:09:52.676 --> 01:09:53.843
Hey.

01:09:54.011 --> 01:09:56.345
You okay? Wake up.

01:09:57.055 --> 01:09:58.180
Wake up.

01:10:16.283 --> 01:10:18.200
Ria, baby.

01:10:19.286 --> 01:10:20.328
What happened to you?

01:10:25.042 --> 01:10:27.001
What are you doing out here?

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:35.134
What you out here for?

01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:38.471
I'm looking for the man
that killed my brother.

01:10:42.851 --> 01:10:44.310
Yeah.

01:10:55.072 --> 01:10:56.822
I have to go.

01:10:57.491 --> 01:10:59.700
I might not come back.

01:10:59.868 --> 01:11:01.744
Give the girls kisses
and hugs from me.

01:11:01.912 --> 01:11:05.373
I kiss and hug all the pussy.
You go kill cocksucker.

01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:21.972
Some boyfriend you got there,
Ms. Lydon.

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.433
He lied to you for six months 
regarding his work?

01:11:24.601 --> 01:11:28.938
Which I guess wouldn't be such a 
big deal if he wasn't a hired killer.

01:11:29.106 --> 01:11:31.816
He made you a target
for the South American mob ... 

01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:34.443
... for kidnapping, torture, or worse.

01:11:34.611 --> 01:11:37.238
He sexually humiliated you
in front of what ... 

01:11:37.406 --> 01:11:39.198
... I don't know, half of Los Angeles?

01:11:39.366 --> 01:11:40.950
Twice.

01:11:41.118 --> 01:11:44.286
Twice. And then left you there
to take the rap?

01:11:44.454 --> 01:11:46.914
And now you can add an arrest
and a police record ... 

01:11:47.082 --> 01:11:50.543
... to a list of wonderful things
Mr. Chelios has brought to your life.

01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:53.921
Help me out here, sweetheart, okay?

01:11:54.089 --> 01:11:58.175
Because --
Because I'm a little bit confused.

01:11:59.302 --> 01:12:04.890
Why the fuck do you continue
to protect this asshole?

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:10.062
That's a dicky question.

01:12:11.106 --> 01:12:13.315
Besides, I don't know
who you're talking about.

01:12:14.985 --> 01:12:18.654
I mean, I'd like to see you fall
out of a helicopter and live.

01:12:18.822 --> 01:12:20.322
What?

01:12:36.339 --> 01:12:38.174
It looks like you made bail.

01:12:38.341 --> 01:12:40.843
- Great. Can I have my stuff back?
- Yeah.

01:12:41.011 --> 01:12:43.471
Yeah. Just a --
Just one little piece of advice.

01:12:43.638 --> 01:12:48.142
Wake the fuck up
and smell what's burning.

01:13:29.684 --> 01:13:30.893
Fuck.

01:13:39.069 --> 01:13:40.986
Hola, Chev.

01:13:42.072 --> 01:13:45.699
I take it you're the greasy fucker
that's been hunting me all day.

01:13:45.867 --> 01:13:46.909
The Ferret.

01:13:47.077 --> 01:13:49.286
Some people know me
by this fucking name.

01:13:49.454 --> 01:13:53.499
And many men have died
cursing the name of El Huron ... 

01:13:53.959 --> 01:13:57.211
... as they choked on their own blood,
and the blood of their families.

01:13:57.379 --> 01:13:59.046
Colorful geezer.

01:14:00.215 --> 01:14:03.300
I was born with another name.

01:14:04.219 --> 01:14:05.761
The name of my father.

01:14:08.181 --> 01:14:10.349
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking hell.

01:14:13.061 --> 01:14:14.603
And my father's father's.

01:14:14.771 --> 01:14:16.230
We're all very sad.

01:14:16.398 --> 01:14:18.566
And the name ... 

01:14:19.609 --> 01:14:21.360
... that I share ... 

01:14:21.528 --> 01:14:23.862
... with my two brothers ... 

01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:26.156
... Alejandro ... 

01:14:30.245 --> 01:14:32.037
... Ricardo ...

01:14:37.919 --> 01:14:39.712
Verona.

01:14:42.799 --> 01:14:46.093
Oh, I can tell, while I dig, dig, dig ... 

01:14:46.261 --> 01:14:50.973
... that you had no idea
that there was a third brother.

01:14:51.141 --> 01:14:54.685
Nope. That fact escaped me.

01:14:54.853 --> 01:14:57.980
What I assure you of, is I would have
made it a fucking hat trick.

01:14:58.148 --> 01:15:00.608
I got a trick or three for you, cabron.

01:15:00.775 --> 01:15:04.653
I'm gonna make you wish
that you was never a man.

01:15:04.821 --> 01:15:06.905
If you want to kill me,
you get on with it.

01:15:07.073 --> 01:15:08.907
What's the rush, Chelios?

01:15:09.868 --> 01:15:14.038
I know someone
who's going to love to watch this.

01:15:44.778 --> 01:15:45.861
You.

01:16:04.047 --> 01:16:07.966
- You got the donor?
- Like you got a boner.

01:16:08.718 --> 01:16:09.968
Hey, baby.

01:16:10.136 --> 01:16:13.222
You always say you want
to be more spontaneous.

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:14.890
Cowboy.

01:16:15.058 --> 01:16:17.101
We gonna go back to my place.

01:16:17.268 --> 01:16:19.061
- Yeah.
- That sounds good.

01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:23.524
Ricardo never wanted
my money, Chelios.

01:16:23.692 --> 01:16:25.693
He was too stubborn.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.153
Wanted to make his own way.

01:16:28.321 --> 01:16:32.825
Now I think he likes
what my money can buy.

01:16:33.451 --> 01:16:36.412
The technology to keep his brain alive.

01:16:36.579 --> 01:16:38.414
Not forever.

01:16:38.581 --> 01:16:41.834
But long enough to watch you die.

01:17:05.442 --> 01:17:07.401
Yo, Ferret. This ain't Roots, man.

01:17:07.569 --> 01:17:09.278
Yeah?

01:17:09.446 --> 01:17:11.280
Hey, cabron.

01:17:13.867 --> 01:17:16.285
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:17:16.453 --> 01:17:19.121
You killed my brother, motherfucker.
Prepare to die.

01:17:51.654 --> 01:17:53.322
Fuck you, Chelios.

01:18:50.964 --> 01:18:52.881
This way, sugar.

01:18:58.137 --> 01:19:01.974
Confucius say, "Karma's a bitch."

01:19:18.908 --> 01:19:21.076
Hello, Ricky.

01:19:23.413 --> 01:19:25.622
Why do we go on like this, Ricky?

01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:27.457
Hurting each other.

01:19:29.586 --> 01:19:31.086
Water?

01:19:31.504 --> 01:19:33.547
Did you say water?

01:19:38.887 --> 01:19:40.721
H2O?

01:19:40.889 --> 01:19:42.431
Coming right up.

01:22:03.865 --> 01:22:18.754
Chev Chelios. Chev.

01:22:18.921 --> 01:22:20.255
Chev.

01:22:20.423 --> 01:22:22.591
Chev. Chev!

01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:19.082
Cut the battery.

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:21.001
Battery's out.

01:25:01.334 --> 01:25:02.667
Paddles. Give me the paddles.

01:25:02.835 --> 01:25:03.919
What's going on?

01:25:08.216 --> 01:25:09.925
Chevy? Clear!

01:25:13.012 --> 01:25:14.846
Fuck!

01:25:17.016 --> 01:25:21.186
- Shit!
- No! God! No.

01:26:17.159 --> 01:26:18.994
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

01:26:19.161 --> 01:26:21.037
What the fuck?

01:26:22.581 --> 01:26:24.165
Jesus.

01:26:26.502 --> 01:26:28.920
It's so hard to keep a straight face.

01:26:29.088 --> 01:26:30.338
Sorry, Ches.

01:27:17.553 --> 01:27:19.220
Stay on the marker!

01:27:19.388 --> 01:27:21.222
- Let's go.
- Body parts ready?

01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:24.184
- Yes.
- All right.

01:27:24.352 --> 01:27:25.393
Here we go!

01:27:25.561 --> 01:27:27.312
- And -- You set there?
- Ready?

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.023
And action, Mike!

01:27:33.402 --> 01:27:35.111
Andrew!

01:27:45.581 --> 01:27:48.416
Go! Go, Lance! Run, Lance!

01:28:15.569 --> 01:28:16.653
Action, Manny!

01:28:16.821 --> 01:28:19.364
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

01:28:19.532 --> 01:28:21.157
You think these muscles are free?

01:28:21.325 --> 01:28:23.326
You think this cock's for free?

01:28:23.494 --> 01:28:26.621
No way! No scabs, no crabs!

01:28:26.789 --> 01:28:28.957
No scabs, no crabs!

01:28:29.125 --> 01:28:31.459
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back!

01:28:31.627 --> 01:28:34.045
I'm gonna bang your prisoner!

01:28:34.213 --> 01:28:37.382
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!

01:28:37.967 --> 01:28:40.093
Look at Jason and say it.

01:28:40.261 --> 01:28:42.470
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!

01:28:42.638 --> 01:28:45.473
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

01:28:45.641 --> 01:28:47.767
Yeah! Yeah!

01:28:47.935 --> 01:28:49.602
Fuck you!

01:29:52.333 --> 01:29:55.043
I take it you're the faggot
that's been hunting me all day?

01:29:55.211 --> 01:29:56.211
No.

01:29:56.378 --> 01:29:57.921
The faggot.

01:29:58.088 --> 01:29:59.714
The faggot. Oh, sorry. The Ferret.

01:30:57.773 --> 01:31:00.692
No dough, no blow!
No dough, no blow!

01:31:00.859 --> 01:31:03.444
Dicks like this don't come for free!

01:31:03.904 --> 01:31:05.613
Lips like this don't come for free.

01:31:05.781 --> 01:31:07.949
That's what I meant to say.

01:31:08.534 --> 01:31:11.286
I meant lips like this
don't come for free.

01:31:11.453 --> 01:31:12.829
All right, keep going.

01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:16.392
Oh, a horse.

01:32:16.894 --> 01:32:18.394
What?

01:32:20.606 --> 01:32:23.524
I never had it that way before.

01:33:14.952 --> 01:33:16.953
- Let us kiss for a second.
- Okay.

01:33:17.121 --> 01:33:18.996
Yeah.

01:33:19.164 --> 01:33:22.417
And here we go. And action!

01:34:02.708 --> 01:34:05.877
Water.

01:34:06.044 --> 01:34:08.588
Fuck, you need a few mints.

01:35:04.978 --> 01:35:07.271
- Holy shit.
- Unbelievable.

01:35:07.439 --> 01:35:10.650
- Yeah.
- Holy shit. Fuck.

01:35:10.818 --> 01:35:12.652
That was fucking awesome.

01:35:12.820 --> 01:35:15.071
- Let's cradle the balls on that.
- Good job, buddy.

01:35:15.239 --> 01:35:17.156
- I'm sure we got it.
- You good?

01:35:17.324 --> 01:35:18.491
- Yeah.
- Good job, brother.

01:35:18.659 --> 01:35:20.535
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:35:20.702 --> 01:35:22.829
Fuck, that was hot.
