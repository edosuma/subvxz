<i>♪ Walking away from you ♪</i>

01:16.250 --> 01:18.040
So, take us back
to the beginning, Jamie.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.416
How did this all start?

01:19.417 --> 01:22.958
Um, okay.
So, about four years ago,

01:22.959 --> 01:25.207
um, my life changed forever,

01:25.208 --> 01:29.457
uh, when I got an email from
a guy called Rocky Flintstone.

01:29.458 --> 01:32.624
It turned out that Rocky
Flintstone was my dad,

01:32.625 --> 01:35.624
and he'd been secretly writing
porn in the garden shed.

01:35.625 --> 01:38.165
The book was called
Belinda Blinked,

01:38.166 --> 01:39.958
and it was horrific.

01:39.959 --> 01:41.332
It was amazing.

01:41.333 --> 01:44.165
It's the best worst book
ever written.

01:44.166 --> 01:48.457
So then my friends, James and Alice,
made me read it to the whole world.

01:48.458 --> 01:51.165
"Belinda Blinked.
It wasn't a dream.

01:51.166 --> 01:54.999
"The job interviewer had just asked her
to remove her jacket and silk blouse."

01:55.000 --> 01:57.165
And the books are about a woman
called Belinda Blumenthal,

01:57.166 --> 02:00.249
who shags her way around the
world, selling pots and pans.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.332
It's one-half erotica,
one-half business manual.

02:03.333 --> 02:07.040
So we started a podcast, and it
went from a few people listening...

02:07.041 --> 02:10.249
I can't see anything! Aah!

02:10.250 --> 02:12.749
Oh, no! I wet myself!

02:12.750 --> 02:14.500
...to quite a lot
of people listening.

02:17.792 --> 02:20.040
But we should say,
it's not a sexy book.

02:20.041 --> 02:23.416
"As Belinda
groaned, the duchess hummed,

02:23.417 --> 02:26.374
"watching her perspiring
pussy meat."

02:26.375 --> 02:28.708
Ack!

02:28.709 --> 02:31.666
Rocky's metaphors are unique.

02:31.667 --> 02:35.416
Her nipples were now as
large as the three-inch rivets

02:35.417 --> 02:40.499
which had held the hull of the
fateful Titanic together.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.708
And he has zero concept
of the female body.

02:43.709 --> 02:45.791
"He grabbed her
cervix..."

02:45.792 --> 02:47.124
He's gonna kill her.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.416
Honestly, if I wasn't
sat here right now,

02:49.417 --> 02:52.082
I would swear to God
he was a virgin.

02:52.083 --> 02:55.499
I mean, it got so crazy that people
were even talking about a movie version.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.582
And actual, proper actors were
lining up to play the characters.

02:58.583 --> 03:01.124
I do like
the idea of playing Dr. Robbins.

03:01.125 --> 03:04.582
I feel like I should put
on a fat suit and play Jim Sterling.

03:04.583 --> 03:08.457
I'd quite like
to play Alfie, the smallish man.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.124
I would go for Adaam.

03:10.125 --> 03:12.708
I've already spoken to my
agents about it.

03:12.709 --> 03:16.541
Yeah, it all got
a little bit out of hand.

03:16.542 --> 03:18.874
My Dad Wrote a Porno.
My Dad Wrote a Porno.

03:18.875 --> 03:22.667
My Dad Wrote a Porno.
My Dad Wrote a Porno.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.332
There are similarities between

03:26.333 --> 03:28.500
your father's work,
and Hamlet.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.833
- Oh, my God!
- Look!

03:31.834 --> 03:34.666
He's a fucking genius.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.583
Come on!
How else have we got here?

03:39.792 --> 03:43.582
So now, I'm reading
my dad's porn on HBO.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.375
Brilliant.

03:50.291 --> 03:53.541
Live from the
Camden Roundhouse, London,

03:53.542 --> 03:58.000
please welcome Jamie,
James, and Alice.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.791
Woo! All right!

04:04.792 --> 04:07.624
Woo!
Woo-hoo!

04:07.625 --> 04:08.750
Woo!

04:09.542 --> 04:12.500
- Yay!
- Yes!

04:16.666 --> 04:21.165
Hi, guys. Um,
my name's Jamie, and...

04:21.166 --> 04:23.165
my dad wrote a porno.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.666
- It's true.
- Yes, he did.

04:24.667 --> 04:26.207
He did do...

04:26.208 --> 04:29.332
Thank you, thank you.
It's my hell, but your entertainment.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.833
Uh, to my dad,

04:31.834 --> 04:34.250
the legend.
Rocky Flintstone.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.874
What a guy.
Okay. Okay.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.582
So he wrote these
shit books, right?

04:41.583 --> 04:45.082
And right at the start,
he wrote something that even he thought

04:45.083 --> 04:48.958
was too shit to include in any
of the Belinda Blinked books.

04:48.959 --> 04:51.582
- So I'm reading that tonight.
- Aw, you...

04:51.583 --> 04:54.082
Yes, yes.

04:54.083 --> 04:56.332
What's it about exactly?
What happens? Um...

04:56.333 --> 04:59.332
Well, it is a Belinda Blinked chapter,
so it's not about anything, at all.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.624
Sure.
But it involves Belinda Blumenthal,

05:02.625 --> 05:06.291
the international sales director
of Steeles Pots and Pans.

05:07.917 --> 05:11.374
Um, and she basically takes
her regional sales managers

05:11.375 --> 05:13.999
on a kind of
team building away day.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.332
Um, 'cause, obviously...
<i>♪ Thank you so much ♪</i>

05:16.333 --> 05:18.874
<i>♪ It's already fantastic ♪</i>

05:18.875 --> 05:20.833
It's so good.
'Cause, well, it's a business book.

05:20.834 --> 05:24.374
So, you know, they're doing a corporate
away day. Makes absolute sense.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.834
Well, London, are
you ready for this?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.416
I think we should, uh,
play the drinking game.

05:38.417 --> 05:41.082
That's a great shout. Yes.
Yeah? Up for it?

05:41.083 --> 05:44.416
We should establish official rules.

05:44.417 --> 05:46.332
- Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
- We should probably, you know...

05:46.333 --> 05:49.040
The official rules.
Okay. Well what about...

05:49.041 --> 05:52.791
You know how Rocky likes to
focus on unnecessary details,

05:52.792 --> 05:55.374
like, if the camera was on
them, like, shagging,

05:55.375 --> 05:58.916
it would slowly zoom to the curtains.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, it just
focuses on the most stupid things.

06:01.834 --> 06:03.416
Distracted. Yes.
Yeah. Exactly.

06:03.417 --> 06:06.165
So every time there's, like,
an unnecessary detail, drink.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.958
- Yeah. Yeah. Agreed.
- Good, good.

06:07.959 --> 06:11.916
Okay, uh, my rule is gonna be...
grammar, bad grammar.

06:11.917 --> 06:15.624
Yes. Exactly. Um, 'cause I
feel like he does it all afterwards.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.290
Yeah. You know, after the event.
So he'll go through,

06:18.291 --> 06:20.082
a little semicolon,
full stop in there.

06:20.083 --> 06:22.040
Let's put a comma.
Yeah. Apostrophe.

06:22.041 --> 06:25.332
For him, I think a semicolon is
just his work winking back at him.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.124
He's like, "You're doing a great
job, Rocky."

06:28.125 --> 06:31.833
Um, and I think, you know, if you're only
gonna drink on one of the rules tonight,

06:31.834 --> 06:35.290
uh, everybody must drink
when Belinda blinks.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.124
Deal.
Yes.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.874
Before we start, I just think
there's one thing

06:39.875 --> 06:43.124
that's really,
really important to just note. Yeah.

06:43.125 --> 06:46.457
Whatever we read,
your dad wrote it.

06:46.458 --> 06:49.290
Looks what's behind me!

06:49.291 --> 06:52.541
That's gonna haunt me.
That's as big as we can manage.

06:52.542 --> 06:56.166
But I think we should open the book.
This thing here.

06:59.291 --> 07:02.541
Dad porn, dad porn, dad porn.

07:02.542 --> 07:04.458
Okay.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.833
"Belinda blinked."

07:11.834 --> 07:13.999
Drink!

07:14.000 --> 07:17.375
Start as we mean to go on... I'm
gonna shit-faced. I can just tell.

07:19.083 --> 07:23.040
The Lost Chapter.

07:23.041 --> 07:28.625
- "Team Building with the Regional Sales Managers..."
- Yeah!

07:31.458 --> 07:34.332
Semicolon.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.624
Yes.
It's already started. Cheers.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.041
On a title.
Yes, Rocky.

07:41.750 --> 07:48.791
"Belinda Blumenthal, international
sales director of Steeles Pots and Pans,

07:48.792 --> 07:51.833
"turned her Mercedes
into the driveway

07:51.834 --> 07:54.040
"of the secluded
manor house,

07:54.041 --> 07:58.457
"she had hired for the team
building away day extravaganza..."

07:58.458 --> 08:01.249
Whoa!
"...on the Cornish coast."

08:01.250 --> 08:04.874
- Oh! Very nice part of the world, very nice.
- It is...

08:04.875 --> 08:06.374
It is a lovely
part of the world,

08:06.375 --> 08:09.833
but it's also about a
seven-hour drive from London.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.499
That's true, actually, yeah.
See, it's a long way to go for a day.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.207
- Yeah. That's true. And back.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.541
And back. Fourteen-hour round trip!
And back. Yeah.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.207
They're gonna be there
for 10 minutes,

08:18.208 --> 08:20.291
quick shag,
back in the car. Bye!

08:21.834 --> 08:25.249
- "The training guru..."
- Guru!

08:25.250 --> 08:29.249
"...she was... she was pinning
the whole show on was good.

08:29.250 --> 08:33.457
No. Very, very good."

08:35.582 --> 08:39.249
Um, who wants to guess
the name of this guru?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.416
Ooh.
Anyone? Name. Yeah.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.582
Veronica. No.

08:43.582 --> 08:47.792
Electra.
Electra? Behave.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.207
Nancy. No.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.541
I feel like this woman's just
lost someone called Nancy.

08:53.542 --> 08:56.249
Nancy!

08:56.250 --> 08:58.207
Nancy!

08:58.208 --> 09:04.082
Where the fuck are you? We're at
the wrong show!

09:04.083 --> 09:07.332
No, I didn't... I'm sorry,
guys, but I didn't hear it.

09:07.333 --> 09:11.750
- Because...
- "Melania was," uh...

09:13.542 --> 09:17.290
- No! Okay.
- I'm... I'm joking. I'm obviously joking.

09:17.291 --> 09:22.666
Um, no. "Natasha Biles..."

09:22.667 --> 09:25.708
Okay. That's an interesting
choice of surname, isn't it?

09:25.709 --> 09:27.874
It is, isn't it?
Because that's not...

09:27.875 --> 09:29.708
It's not a sexy liquid,
is it? Bile.

09:29.709 --> 09:33.541
- No, it's kind of like pre-vomit, isn't it?
- Yeah.

09:33.542 --> 09:37.374
Acid reflux is essentially...
That's basically it. Yeah.

09:37.375 --> 09:42.124
"Natasha Biles was
the best in the industry,

09:42.125 --> 09:46.542
and she almost always guaranteed
exceptional results."

09:49.625 --> 09:54.833
"In reality, she herself
was a fiery redhead."

09:54.834 --> 09:57.624
Oh.
Alice.

09:57.625 --> 10:00.332
Hello.
Guilty as charged.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.791
"Of French extraction,
not the less."

10:04.792 --> 10:10.041
"As it turned out, she was also
the local female lifeboat member."

10:11.458 --> 10:14.082
I'm drinking on that.
I'm drinking on that, as well.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.165
You don't really want, you know,
to think about drowning people

10:17.166 --> 10:19.833
when you're reading porn.
Yeah. Really. Yeah.

10:19.834 --> 10:22.154
There'll be a small cross
section of the community that do.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.207
So, "As it turned out, she was also
the local female lifeboat member, so,

10:28.208 --> 10:32.040
"she was equally at home in a pair
of yellow Wellingtons and oil skins,

10:32.041 --> 10:35.166
as in a team building
businesswoman's uniform."

10:37.542 --> 10:39.708
That is a lot of interesting

10:39.709 --> 10:42.041
sartorial choices
in one sentence.

10:43.333 --> 10:48.333
"With a light heart,
Belinda checked in."

10:49.208 --> 10:54.749
And, sorry. Can I just say,
that's one fucking paragraph.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.374
Look.

10:57.375 --> 11:03.207
There it is. On its own.
It's just so sad.

11:03.208 --> 11:07.375
It's unorthodox, I'll give you that.
It's very important.

11:08.417 --> 11:14.291
"She strolled down the wide,
exquisitely carpeted staircase."

11:15.083 --> 11:18.958
- Oh, God. We're gonna be drunker than...
- Looks like a drink.

11:18.959 --> 11:21.457
The weirdest things
get her off, don't they?

11:21.458 --> 11:26.000
Uh, yeah. Yeah. She's, like walking
down the stairs going, who laid that?

11:28.417 --> 11:31.749
Oh, my God, it goes all the
way to the edge. Ah!

11:31.750 --> 11:33.874
Kill!
What? That's...

11:33.875 --> 11:37.749
That's your definition of "exquisitely
carpeted"?

11:37.750 --> 11:39.916
- Functional carpet.
- To the edge.

11:39.917 --> 11:42.749
To the edge of the room.

11:42.750 --> 11:48.457
"Her comfortable, yet sexy
black leather trouser suit..."

11:48.458 --> 11:51.958
Whoa, another great look.
Whoa.

11:51.959 --> 11:55.207
Yeah. Did you say it was
comfortable, yet sexy?

11:55.208 --> 11:57.541
Yeah, yeah. "Comfortable,
yet sexy." Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.792
I feel like she's worn it a lot, like
there's a bit of give in the gusset.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.958
Oh, James.

12:04.959 --> 12:08.457
It's comfy.
A baggy crotch. No.

12:08.458 --> 12:15.040
"Her comfortable, yet sexy,
black leather trouser suit squeaked...

12:15.041 --> 12:18.125
as she..."
So she's literally like...

12:21.583 --> 12:24.290
Mental.

12:24.291 --> 12:29.749
"...as she strutted along the long,
tiled hallway into the conference room."

12:29.750 --> 12:33.165
I would argue that surfaces
are getting a lot of airtime,

12:33.166 --> 12:36.040
- and not... not much sex, thus far.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.666
No.

12:37.667 --> 12:42.332
"Natasha stood up and immediately
pushed her throbbing tongue

12:42.333 --> 12:45.165
- into Belinda's purple mouth."
- Okay.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.958
Wow.

12:46.959 --> 12:50.749
Now we've started.
I spoke too soon. Okay.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.582
- We're literally in Belinda's mouth.
- Yes.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.999
Yeah, well, Natasha is.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.082
There's a lot
of activity there.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.040
- There's quite a lot going on.
- Lovely greeting, isn't it?

13:00.041 --> 13:01.624
Yeah.
Do you want to break it down?

13:01.625 --> 13:03.666
Oh, what, go fifty-fifty?
Yeah. I'll, uh...

13:03.667 --> 13:06.124
What was it, purple mouth?
I'll take the purple mouth.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.749
And I will take
throbbing tongue.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.207
Okay. Good. I won't take
throbbing tongue, although...

13:10.208 --> 13:12.040
We'll see. There's some...

13:12.041 --> 13:14.207
The night is young.
...eligible bachelors in the room, yeah.

13:14.208 --> 13:17.457
- Uh, yeah. Purple mouth.
- Uh, is she dying?

13:17.458 --> 13:20.791
- No! No. No, no, she's fine. She's fine.
- No. Choking?

13:20.792 --> 13:22.833
- Ill?
- No, no, no. She's fine.

13:22.834 --> 13:26.124
- Okay, fine.
- Okay. My question is about the aforementioned,

13:26.125 --> 13:27.958
uh, throbbing tongue.
Yes, Alice. Yes?

13:27.959 --> 13:31.374
Um, I just wanted to know is that
this kind of motion, like a...

13:31.375 --> 13:33.249
Yeah.

13:33.250 --> 13:36.374
Yeah. I imagine it's kind of
like, yeah, like, like, pulsing.

13:36.375 --> 13:40.207
Like, you can feel the blood, like...

13:40.208 --> 13:43.708
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is that your line?

13:43.709 --> 13:46.958
'Cause you are literally fucked
for the rest of this book, like...

13:46.959 --> 13:49.999
- Oh, sorry. One more question, actually.
- Yes?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.457
Um, have they ever met?

13:52.458 --> 13:56.499
Interesting question. They have...
You're such a prude.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.416
- ...never met. No.
- Never met.

13:58.417 --> 14:01.916
Okay. Good. Not even a hello?
Just a...

14:01.917 --> 14:04.582
Nice to meet you. Uh...

14:04.583 --> 14:08.207
Um, guys, guys, guys.

14:08.208 --> 14:11.541
"Belinda blinked."

14:11.542 --> 14:13.374
- Cheers, cheers.
- Mm.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.791
- To you and yours. To you and yours.
- To you and yours.

14:15.792 --> 14:18.416
Right.

14:18.417 --> 14:20.499
Oh!

14:20.500 --> 14:24.082
You all right?
Do you know you're making a noise?

14:24.083 --> 14:26.249
Yes. There's something,
there's something...

14:26.250 --> 14:29.749
You're exhaling audibly.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.582
Um... a...

14:31.583 --> 14:33.999
Would you just give me
a fucking second!

14:34.000 --> 14:36.625
You're deflating.
We're concerned.

14:40.291 --> 14:44.165
I don't know what's happening,
but can it last forever?

14:44.166 --> 14:48.291
"I-I'm, ah... Natasha.

14:49.208 --> 14:53.290
"And I'm in charge naah.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.749
Yeah? Yeah?"

14:54.750 --> 14:57.749
- No, definitely. "I'm in charge naah."
- Yeah?

14:57.750 --> 14:59.666
"Charge naah."

14:59.667 --> 15:03.582
Was that supposed to be...
French? That was French.

15:03.583 --> 15:07.082
It's very good, I thought. No, no.
I-I think that was a hate crime.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.666
Oh, okay, okay.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.207
- I'm offended for them.
- Okay, fine.

15:12.208 --> 15:14.541
Uh, is anyone in the room
French tonight?

15:14.542 --> 15:16.999
Or at least thinks they can do
a better accent than I.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.833
- Ooh.
- Yes.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.165
Um, are you
willing to play

15:21.166 --> 15:23.499
Natasha Biles
for the rest of the show?

15:23.500 --> 15:27.541
Yeah?

15:27.542 --> 15:30.833
You can't be worse
than me, so...

15:30.834 --> 15:34.958
Um, but, come on, please take
this fucking seriously, okay.

15:34.959 --> 15:37.833
I take my accents
incredibly seriously.

15:37.834 --> 15:39.666
You know, I... I prep them.

15:39.667 --> 15:42.958
They're not always appreciated
in their time, um...

15:42.959 --> 15:45.833
But we want real commitment,
okay? Think the method.

15:45.834 --> 15:49.165
Daniel Day-Lewis,
Meryl Streep-level, okay?

15:49.166 --> 15:51.249
What is your name, by the way?
Tim.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.082
No! You're Natasha Biles!

15:53.083 --> 15:55.499
- Natasha! Natasha.
- For God's sake!

15:55.500 --> 15:57.499
Look alive, Natasha.
Tim, Tim, Tim,

15:57.500 --> 15:59.833
- Tim, Tim, Tim... Oh.
- This will not end well.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.582
Okay.

16:01.583 --> 16:06.166
I am, uh,
Natasha, and, uh, I'm in charge now.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.541
I promised myself I wouldn't do
this, Tim, but, um...

16:17.542 --> 16:19.833
Oh, fuck off, Levine. That was...
That was incredible.

16:19.834 --> 16:22.374
...middling! That was honestly...
incredible.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.290
- Thank you for that.
- Thank you.

16:24.291 --> 16:27.207
I will call on you.
But please...

16:27.208 --> 16:30.959
don't build your part in the meantime.
You know. Switch his mic off.

16:32.834 --> 16:35.634
But, no. Thank you so much for being
involved. We really appreciate it.

16:38.583 --> 16:43.666
"Natasha put her hand
on Belinda's...

16:43.667 --> 16:45.541
knee."

16:45.542 --> 16:47.499
- Did you hear that anticipation?
- Yeah.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.958
They're gagging for it, this lot.
Look at them. They are so sex-starved.

16:49.959 --> 16:53.999
Everyone's like,
where did she put her hand?

16:54.000 --> 16:58.374
"Feeling no flinching
or resistance..."

16:58.375 --> 17:01.749
That's called consent, everybody.

17:01.750 --> 17:04.415
What?
No. No, it's not.

17:04.416 --> 17:06.958
That's really not consent.

17:06.959 --> 17:10.582
What, not
flinching or resisting?

17:10.583 --> 17:13.749
Do you want to have a conference
behind my hands? Yeah.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.749
You're so wrong. Um...

17:16.750 --> 17:22.124
That's not consent, is it? If somebody
just doesn't flinch.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.915
Oh, it's so murky, isn't it?

17:24.916 --> 17:28.290
So if they don't recoil...
If they're not sick, is normally my...

17:28.290 --> 17:30.290
Right. Okay.
Okay. Yeah.

17:30.291 --> 17:34.124
Um, so, "...feeling no
flinching or resistance,

17:34.125 --> 17:36.791
she slid it up
the leather-clad leg."

17:36.792 --> 17:41.207
- Slid what up? Oh, the hand. The hand.
- Her hand. Her hand.

17:41.208 --> 17:44.082
Uh, the leather-clad leg
of the chair, or of Belinda?

17:44.083 --> 17:47.499
Of Belinda! Okay. Sorry.
There's a lot of leather.

17:47.500 --> 17:53.458
"Belinda opened her leg."

17:54.792 --> 17:57.959
One leg?
Singular.

17:59.125 --> 18:02.499
She just sort of,
spatchcocked her thigh.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.958
Yeah. Yeah.

18:03.959 --> 18:08.499
So, "Belinda opened her leg,"
um, "allowing Natasha..."

18:08.500 --> 18:11.916
This is so stupid.
"...free access to..."

18:11.917 --> 18:14.374
If you say WiFi,
I'm walking out.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.749
I was just... that's just my...
that's my line.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.332
Why? She's got four bars
up there. Just...

18:19.333 --> 18:21.666
She's got
a very connected vagina.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.833
Just put your email in,
and you're away.

18:24.834 --> 18:28.374
I want you to know, at this point,
I could say 4G-spot, but I haven't.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.916
I just want you to know that. I've taken the
high ground. I've taken the high ground.

18:31.917 --> 18:35.833
Uh, no, um...
Uh, "free access to her groin."

18:35.834 --> 18:38.791
- Groin?
- Yeah. Sexy, huh?

18:38.792 --> 18:42.207
"With an experienced... hand,

18:42.208 --> 18:45.916
"Natasha undid Belinda's
patent leather belt

18:45.917 --> 18:50.207
and pulled down..."
Are you having an episode?

18:50.208 --> 18:53.624
Why are you speaking like that?
This is really fucking hard to read.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.958
Can I just get this... just this
one sentence up, please?

18:55.959 --> 19:00.332
So, look. So, "Belinda opened her leg allowing
Natasha free access to her groin." Fine.

19:00.333 --> 19:05.124
"With an experienced... hand"

19:05.125 --> 19:10.999
"Natasha undid Belinda's
patent leather belt

19:11.000 --> 19:13.874
"and pulled, down...

19:13.875 --> 19:18.208
Oh, my God.
"...her trousers's zip."

19:19.542 --> 19:23.374
"Trousers's zip."

19:23.375 --> 19:27.374
We have to drink on that.
Oh, drink. Drinks for days.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.207
You couldn't dream it
so good, could you.

19:30.208 --> 19:35.749
"Her hand... dove into the vaginal
area."

19:35.750 --> 19:38.749
- Oh! Bloody hell!
- Whoa!

19:38.750 --> 19:41.082
Fucking hell, James.
Sounds like she's...

19:41.083 --> 19:43.875
That was good.
I heard the wind rush past you.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.916
Just straight in there.
No splash.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.416
Oh. Don't...
Oh, sorry.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.916
Don't say no splash.

19:52.917 --> 19:55.708
I heard it as I said it. Sorry.

19:55.709 --> 20:00.750
"Her hand... dove into the vaginal
area, where two...

20:01.834 --> 20:04.457
- fingers..."
- Oh, God.

20:04.458 --> 20:07.833
"...pulled aside..."

20:07.834 --> 20:10.332
- What?
- "...the flimsy..."

20:10.333 --> 20:13.624
Flimsy? Aah!
"red...

20:13.625 --> 20:15.791
- panties."
- Whew.

20:15.792 --> 20:19.332
Okay.
So, like... No, like that.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.457
No, like that.
What are you doing?

20:21.458 --> 20:23.457
What was... Just do that again.
What was that?

20:23.458 --> 20:26.249
Now, I was just hooking them,
the panties, to the side.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.999
I mean, I would
rather you didn't, but yeah.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.457
- But then I was thinking...
- What is that?

20:30.458 --> 20:32.958
Stop doing that.
What is that?

20:32.959 --> 20:35.541
I thought that might be
the inflammatory move. Um...

20:35.542 --> 20:39.416
No, I was just thinking
of those... sexy pants.

20:39.417 --> 20:41.124
Uh, you know the ones
that are cut up the middle.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.207
- There's a chap, "I know.
- Yeah."

20:43.208 --> 20:44.791
Um...
"Oh, I've seen 'em."

20:44.792 --> 20:47.749
Um, so then you would do that,
or like... that.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.124
Stop! What are you...?
Whoa.

20:49.125 --> 20:52.625
They're not curtains.
Fucking hell. Morning!

20:53.667 --> 20:59.290
That's more like Mum
on an iPad, isn't it? That's like...

20:59.291 --> 21:05.666
"Two fingers pulled aside the
flimsy red panties, and entered

21:05.667 --> 21:09.667
her clitoris."

21:14.166 --> 21:18.332
Yes?
James, you have a question.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.374
The lady
in the blouse. Yes?

21:20.375 --> 21:23.582
Yeah. Um, not
my area of expertise,

21:23.583 --> 21:25.791
Yes. Yeah.
But...

21:25.792 --> 21:28.583
you cannot enter a clitoris?

21:30.959 --> 21:33.417
- No, please.
- Whoa, whoa.

21:35.542 --> 21:40.165
James, sit down.
You lot, you should know better.

21:40.166 --> 21:44.457
Do not applaud
basic knowledge like that.

21:44.458 --> 21:46.499
Especially when he said it
as a fucking question.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.374
"You cannot enter a clitoris?"

21:49.375 --> 21:50.958
That's actually progress,
worryingly.

21:50.959 --> 21:53.332
Yeah, well, that's true. Yeah.
I'll put that in the notebook.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.541
- That's another learning for another day.
- Is there a notebook?

21:55.542 --> 21:58.040
You know, just the things I've learned.
Musings.

21:58.041 --> 22:01.457
Musings, you know, "You cannot enter
a clitoris." Yeah. Great. Good.

22:01.458 --> 22:05.040
"Not flinching is not
consent."

22:05.041 --> 22:09.458
"Belinda gently eased
her trousers down her asshole."

22:14.000 --> 22:17.583
Asshole!

22:18.709 --> 22:21.082
"Down her asshole."

22:21.083 --> 22:24.959
How big's her asshole? Down?

22:26.125 --> 22:30.541
Asshole. Asshole... Into the
lower mezzanine of her asshole.

22:30.542 --> 22:33.207
- That's really cool. He's just...
- Wow.

22:33.208 --> 22:36.749
He's got asshole in there, hasn't he?
Dad, what the fuck? Like...

22:36.750 --> 22:40.124
That's not nice.
Are you proud of him?

22:40.125 --> 22:42.875
Not right now. No.

22:43.792 --> 22:49.958
"Belinda gently eased
her trousers down her asshole,

22:49.959 --> 22:53.958
"being careful not to impede
Natasha's rhythmic touching..."

22:53.959 --> 22:55.791
Ooh.

22:55.792 --> 22:58.666
- Hang on, hang on, hang on. So, Natasha's like that.
- Yeah.

22:58.667 --> 23:01.374
- But Belinda's like, "I'm so sorry."
- Yeah, so like...

23:01.375 --> 23:04.124
"Can I just, like..."

23:04.125 --> 23:06.374
Do you mind if...?
Oh, whoa!

23:06.375 --> 23:09.874
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, I didn't. No, I didn't.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.332
You touched a bollock.
No, I didn't!

23:11.333 --> 23:12.833
- You did.
- Did she really?

23:12.834 --> 23:14.958
You touched a bollock.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.999
It was fine. I thought we were fine.
You were just saying...

23:17.000 --> 23:20.124
Alice entered my clitoris.
No, I didn't.

23:20.125 --> 23:24.082
I'm not surprised. Five-finger
Levine was going for it up there.

23:24.083 --> 23:27.124
She was absolutely
loving it.

23:27.125 --> 23:30.290
"Belinda put her left leg up

23:30.291 --> 23:33.750
on the arm of Natasha's
carved oak captain's chair."

23:38.000 --> 23:41.499
"She ran her left hand
through her raven mane... Ooh!

23:41.500 --> 23:44.416
"...whilst her right
caressed her shapely body.

23:44.417 --> 23:48.499
"Tracing the line
of her taut inner thigh,

23:48.500 --> 23:53.791
she stroked her fingertips
over Natasha's broad shoulders."

23:53.792 --> 23:57.708
Sorry, Jamie. I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Yes. Sorry.

23:57.709 --> 23:59.874
Anyone else
getting a bit lost?

23:59.875 --> 24:02.582
- It is a bit hard to follow, yeah. To be fair.
- Yeah, like...

24:02.583 --> 24:04.666
- Just... just now.
- Just now.

24:04.667 --> 24:07.290
- Like, bits are going in different places.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:07.291 --> 24:10.624
It's kind of turning into a bit of a
game of Twister, isn't it? Yeah. It is.

24:10.625 --> 24:12.958
Do you know what this would be
a great opportunity to do?

24:12.959 --> 24:16.124
Something we can't do on the podcast.
Leave early?

24:16.125 --> 24:19.457
No. But great idea.
No, no, no, no. Yeah.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.874
A recreation.
Yes!

24:21.875 --> 24:25.040
Let's bring the book to life!

24:25.041 --> 24:26.582
I'm up for that. Yeah.
I'm game. Yeah.

24:26.583 --> 24:29.958
Okay, great. So I'm gonna
need a couple of volunteers

24:29.959 --> 24:31.874
from the audience.

24:31.875 --> 24:34.207
I'm gonna go... I think
I'm gonna go amongst them.

24:34.208 --> 24:36.624
Good luck. Lube me up.
I'm going in.

24:36.625 --> 24:40.416
All right. Okay.
Um, anyone... anyone someone's plus one?

24:40.417 --> 24:43.041
Anyone, like,
what the hell am I... Oh! Oh!

24:44.083 --> 24:46.165
Hello.
Hi.

24:46.166 --> 24:49.582
Hi. Uh, so you're a plus one?
Yes.

24:49.583 --> 24:51.290
Is this a date?
No.

24:51.291 --> 24:53.249
Yes, it is.
It's a date?

24:53.250 --> 24:55.124
It is. It is.
A first date?

24:55.125 --> 24:57.874
Yes, it is.

24:57.875 --> 25:00.666
What was that?
It definitely is a first date.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.582
Oh, my God! We've got a first date!
Oh, my God. Right.

25:04.583 --> 25:09.082
Right, right, right.
What's your name? Ari. Ari!

25:09.083 --> 25:11.791
Ari. Ari, and...
Tom.

25:11.792 --> 25:13.542
Ari and Tom.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.624
So, how did you meet?
We work together.

25:17.625 --> 25:20.749
You work together? Oh, my God.
It's like Steeles Pots and Pans!

25:20.750 --> 25:24.916
Where do you work?

25:24.917 --> 25:26.332
No, no...

25:26.333 --> 25:27.958
A chemical company.
No, no.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.709
A chemical company.

25:32.083 --> 25:35.541
Our company makes
the latex for condoms.

25:35.542 --> 25:39.582
Are you fucking joking me?

25:39.583 --> 25:42.041
Oh, my God.

25:45.208 --> 25:48.875
Well, um, I hope you manage to use
your own products this evening.

25:50.417 --> 25:53.417
Have a fabulous night.
Give 'em a round of applause, guys.

25:57.667 --> 26:01.457
Uh, okay. So, would anyone
like to help us recreate

26:01.458 --> 26:03.124
a scene this evening?

26:03.125 --> 26:07.124
Oh, yes. Oh, my God. She's got,
like, the perfect Belinda hair.

26:07.125 --> 26:09.124
Okay.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.416
Hello. What's your name?
Katie.

26:11.417 --> 26:14.249
Katie. Okay, Katie.
What do you do for a job?

26:14.250 --> 26:17.332
I'm a chef.
She's a chef!

26:17.333 --> 26:20.666
She works with pots and pans!

26:20.667 --> 26:23.541
- It's fate.
- It's meant to be.

26:23.542 --> 26:27.082
You're perfect.
Katie, you're our Belinda.

26:27.083 --> 26:29.374
There you go.

26:29.375 --> 26:33.999
Head up to the stage.
Uh, we also need a Natasha.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.999
So, will you be our Natasha?
Of course. Yeah.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.207
Amazing. Okay. We have our Natasha.
Give her a round of applause.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.709
Head up to the stage.
Let's go.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.207
Okay. Right.
So, if you take a seat

26:48.208 --> 26:50.207
in the chair,
you're Natasha.

26:50.208 --> 26:51.749
You stand there.
You're Belinda.

26:51.750 --> 26:54.374
Okay. Right. So,
what's gonna happen is,

26:54.375 --> 26:55.916
Jamie's gonna read
from the book,

26:55.917 --> 26:58.999
and you literally have to
act out what he says. Okay?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.624
Good luck. It's bad.

27:01.625 --> 27:04.124
Um, I feel like
we need to help these two

27:04.125 --> 27:06.207
- get in the mood, though, don't we?
- Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

27:06.208 --> 27:10.417
Could we set, uh,
a kind of sexy mood onstage, please?

27:14.417 --> 27:16.874
Ooh, yes.
I also have something for you.

27:16.875 --> 27:20.875
- Oh, wow.
- LED tea-lights. Alice!

27:23.333 --> 27:25.165
You shouldn't have.

27:25.166 --> 27:28.040
I think we're learning a lot
about Alice Levine's private life, here.

27:28.041 --> 27:32.082
LED tea-lights. Hello!
They work every time. Every time. Yeah.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.708
Okay, Jamie.
I think we're ready.

27:33.709 --> 27:36.708
So, when you're ready to...
Okay.

27:36.709 --> 27:39.499
"Belinda put
her left leg

27:39.500 --> 27:43.874
up on the arm of Natasha's
carved oak captain's chair."

27:43.875 --> 27:47.709
Okay, you have to come... Whoa!

27:52.709 --> 27:56.959
So that's what it looks like!

27:59.417 --> 28:00.874
Oh, gods!

28:00.875 --> 28:04.082
Okay, hang on. Have you got...
Oh, can I just borrow that?

28:04.083 --> 28:06.165
Okay, put your left foot up.
Trust me, trust me.

28:06.166 --> 28:08.041
Okay. On the arm. On the arm.

28:10.875 --> 28:13.625
There you go. Hold that there.
Hold that there. Okay.

28:14.625 --> 28:18.874
"She ran her left hand
through her raven mane,

28:18.875 --> 28:22.416
whilst her right
caressed her shapely body."

28:22.417 --> 28:24.916
I'll hold the hat for you.
There you go. Oh, thank you.

28:24.917 --> 28:27.749
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Yes!

28:27.750 --> 28:31.290
Woo!

28:31.291 --> 28:35.624
Has anyone else got a semi, because...

28:35.625 --> 28:37.708
This is hot stuff.

28:37.709 --> 28:42.207
"Tracing the line
of her taut inner thigh..."

28:42.208 --> 28:44.374
There you go. Yeah.

28:44.375 --> 28:49.457
"...she stroked her fingertips
over Natasha's broad shoulders."

28:49.458 --> 28:53.541
Okay, so if you bring them around here,
just stroke her like a cat. There you go.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.624
Oh! Almost!
Oh, God.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.541
Leg up. Arm here.
There we go.

28:57.542 --> 28:59.666
I feel like James
would be such a bossy lover.

28:59.667 --> 29:03.833
No, arm there. No, caress me there.
Leg up. Arm there. Come on.

29:03.834 --> 29:08.458
Yeah. Okay.
"She grabbed her left breast."

29:12.834 --> 29:14.999
If Rocky's written it,
it's possible.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.165
I have to grab it forward.

29:17.166 --> 29:19.583
There we go.
She's on the breast!

29:25.417 --> 29:27.582
I'll take that.

29:27.583 --> 29:31.457
"She squeezed
a nut-shaped nipple..."

29:31.458 --> 29:33.332
Wait, wait, wait.
We've got nuts.

29:33.333 --> 29:36.040
We've got some nuts.
We'll bring you a nut.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.916
Okay,
what have we got?

29:37.917 --> 29:40.666
What would you like?
What nipple would you like?

29:40.667 --> 29:42.457
Should we go with that one?
Yeah, sure.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.958
- That's nice and fancy.
- That's offensive, but, yeah.

29:44.959 --> 29:46.457
No, no.
You hold it.

29:46.458 --> 29:49.457
You hold it where the nipple goes.
There we go.

29:49.458 --> 29:51.624
"She squeezed
a nut-shaped nipple

29:51.625 --> 29:54.708
and followed the outline
with her forefinger."

29:54.709 --> 29:58.207
- "Going, going 'round."
- Going 'round.

29:58.208 --> 30:00.708
- "And 'round."
- And 'round.

30:00.709 --> 30:03.082
"And round."
And round.

30:03.083 --> 30:04.875
"And 'round."

30:05.458 --> 30:08.958
"But increasing the pressure
with each circumnavigation."

30:08.959 --> 30:11.165
Okay, you really give it
some, and you're enjoying it.

30:11.166 --> 30:12.417
You're enjoying it.

30:14.875 --> 30:19.040
"Natasha moaned deeply."

30:19.041 --> 30:22.667
Uh...

30:28.542 --> 30:32.165
"Belinda bent her head..."
There we go.

30:32.166 --> 30:37.416
"...and started to excavate
her damp cave."

30:37.417 --> 30:40.332
No, no, no,
no, no, no. That's quite enough.

30:40.333 --> 30:43.082
Let's stop the music.
Let's get the lights back to normal.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.916
I think that's quite enough.
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:45.917 --> 30:48.624
please give a round of applause
for Belinda and Natasha.

30:48.625 --> 30:50.500
Take a bow, girls.
Take a bow.

30:54.125 --> 30:56.917
Thank you. Thank you.

31:00.792 --> 31:04.749
I mean, that was...
That was a train wreck.

31:04.750 --> 31:07.249
- That was a lot.
- But, you know, well done, James.

31:07.250 --> 31:09.874
I saw a vagina.

31:09.875 --> 31:11.416
Okay.

31:11.417 --> 31:14.249
"Suddenly,
the girls heard the sound

31:14.250 --> 31:16.082
of the regional
sales managers..."

31:16.083 --> 31:17.332
Oh, my God.
That's why we're here.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.165
I'd completely forgotten
why we were here.

31:19.166 --> 31:22.457
It's like the Beatles have arrived.

31:22.458 --> 31:26.457
"...of the regional sales
manager's cars parking outside.

31:26.458 --> 31:28.833
"They quickly dressed
one another,

31:28.834 --> 31:33.124
finishing just as her subordinates
plodded into the room."

31:33.125 --> 31:35.624
Way to kill the energy, Rocky.
Thanks.

31:35.625 --> 31:38.207
"Patrick O'Hamlin..."

31:38.208 --> 31:40.040
Yay!

31:40.041 --> 31:43.999
Yeah, he's in charge of two
whole countries, lest we forget.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.874
Scotland, and Ireland. Busy man.

31:47.875 --> 31:52.291
"Ken Dewsbury..."

31:52.792 --> 31:57.999
Really? He films women
in his cellar.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.332
Guys, come on.

32:00.333 --> 32:04.375
You guys are sick.
"Des Martin..."

32:08.208 --> 32:12.332
And he dribbles during sex.
God, this lot.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.499
"And Dave Wilcox..."

32:14.500 --> 32:16.541
Oh.

32:16.542 --> 32:20.082
The Ringo of the group,
clearly.

32:20.083 --> 32:24.791
"...slumped into the expansive
collection of chairs."

32:24.792 --> 32:27.874
So, the regional sales managers are
kind of all on the same level, right,

32:27.875 --> 32:29.416
within the hierarchy
of the company?

32:29.417 --> 32:31.374
Yeah, they're all under
Belinda, so to speak.

32:31.375 --> 32:33.958
I actually, um, thought
it'd be useful to see

32:33.959 --> 32:36.958
the kind of company structure
of Steeles Pots and Pans.

32:36.959 --> 32:39.666
Uh, 'cause there's been so much
thought put into these books.

32:39.667 --> 32:42.332
Um, so I actually
have it here. Um...

32:42.333 --> 32:44.165
So, there's Belinda,
the center of it all.

32:44.166 --> 32:46.082
I love that we're
supposed to be turned on,

32:46.083 --> 32:49.541
and we're looking at a chart
of the company structure

32:49.542 --> 32:51.374
of a pots and pans company.

32:51.375 --> 32:54.582
Yeah, it's not the most sexy, is it?
It's also not that useful.

32:54.583 --> 32:57.791
What's really important
is to see who's fucked who.

32:57.792 --> 33:00.874
Yes! So, let's...
let's change that,

33:00.875 --> 33:04.124
and see who's done
the dirty with whom.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.541
Oh, jeez.

33:05.542 --> 33:07.457
Yeah. So, you really kind
of, so, you know...

33:07.458 --> 33:09.749
Wow.
What do all the lines mean?

33:09.750 --> 33:13.374
Yeah. So, red is
"flirting whilst nude."

33:13.375 --> 33:16.040
Um, you
know, so not that much

33:16.041 --> 33:18.457
of that's gone on, actually,
at Steeles Pots and Pans.

33:18.458 --> 33:20.749
Heavy petting
is rife.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.457
A lot of that's
been going on.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.124
That's
the blue line.

33:24.125 --> 33:25.666
Then you've got
all the sex,

33:25.667 --> 33:26.874
which is
the green one,

33:26.875 --> 33:28.916
So again, not that much
going on at Steeles.

33:28.917 --> 33:30.958
So let's widen it out,

33:30.959 --> 33:32.499
and have a look
at the context

33:32.500 --> 33:35.249
with every character
that's ever graced

33:35.250 --> 33:37.874
- the Belinda Blinked universe.
- Oh, my God.

33:37.875 --> 33:40.416
- Oh, my God.
- Look at it.

33:40.417 --> 33:43.749
It's like the London
Underground. Look at it.

33:43.750 --> 33:47.457
- I love that all lines lead to Belinda, as well.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:47.458 --> 33:52.417
Although, and this is so sad,
look, Jim Thompson. Nothing!

33:53.542 --> 33:57.416
Not a sausage, literally.

33:57.417 --> 34:00.332
- Poor Jim!
- Poor Jim!

34:00.333 --> 34:04.749
"But the session
had begun."

34:04.750 --> 34:07.249
Yes, it had.

34:07.250 --> 34:12.040
"Natasha placed three dice
onto the table."

34:12.041 --> 34:13.958
- Dice?
- Dice.

34:13.958 --> 34:19.125
Okay. "And asked
each person to take a throw."

34:20.708 --> 34:25.581
"Patrick O'Hamlin.
He went first." Oh, yeah.

34:25.583 --> 34:28.250
"And with a hint of a tease,

34:29.000 --> 34:33.998
he scored three... sixes!"

34:34.000 --> 34:35.708
Oh, that's good!

34:35.708 --> 34:39.541
That is the best you can
do with three dice.

34:39.542 --> 34:42.290
I'm sorry. What are we playing?

34:42.291 --> 34:44.791
Uh, we're playing dice.
Dice. Yeah, he did say that.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.998
Not a game, but cool.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.792
- "Everyone else groaned..."
- Oh, let's groan.

34:52.208 --> 34:55.165
"...swearing at the luck
of the Irish..."

34:55.166 --> 34:58.207
Bastards.

34:58.208 --> 35:01.332
"...the rest of the RSMs
took their throws.

35:01.333 --> 35:06.791
"Des Martin scored
a good, solid ten..."

35:06.792 --> 35:10.583
That's decent.
"...from a three, a five, and a two."

35:12.500 --> 35:15.166
<i>♪ Nobody cares! ♪</i>

35:15.917 --> 35:19.917
"Dave Wilcox scored a 12...

35:21.375 --> 35:24.999
"...from a five, a six,
and a one."

35:25.000 --> 35:27.833
I love that he's just
filling pages.

35:27.834 --> 35:32.082
"And Ken Dewsbury...

35:32.083 --> 35:34.874
- "...a measly seven."
- Ooh.

35:34.875 --> 35:37.833
Oh, let me guess.
A one, a four, a two.

35:37.834 --> 35:42.375
"From a two,
a three, and a two." Oh.

35:43.041 --> 35:46.207
"Natasha picked up the dice."

35:46.208 --> 35:48.207
Oh, there's more dice,
more dice.

35:48.208 --> 35:51.749
"And she passed them
on to Belinda."

35:51.750 --> 35:55.290
- It's a lot of dice admin.
- Yeah.

35:55.291 --> 35:57.166
"Belinda smiled, but...

35:58.291 --> 36:00.582
"she didn't wink."

36:00.583 --> 36:03.332
Then don't write it. Yeah.
Good to know. Thanks, Dad.

36:03.333 --> 36:06.207
You don't need to
document it if it didn't happen.

36:06.208 --> 36:09.583
"Her quick but casual throw..."

36:11.417 --> 36:14.750
Don't know where they went.
Do not care.

36:16.417 --> 36:21.542
"Her quick but casual throw
resulted...

36:22.542 --> 36:26.291
in a score..." Oh, can we drumroll?
Can we do a little...?

36:29.792 --> 36:31.959
"...of..."

36:36.083 --> 36:40.374
"...four..."

36:40.375 --> 36:45.999
Oh, God.
"...from a one, a two...

36:46.000 --> 36:48.208
and another wretched one."

36:49.750 --> 36:51.666
That's
disappointing.

36:51.667 --> 36:57.624
"Natasha Biles looked
daggers at her..."

36:57.625 --> 37:03.000
"...as a stunned silence said everything
there was to say on the matter.

37:04.166 --> 37:08.000
"Belinda lowered her eyes
and thought...

37:09.583 --> 37:11.542
"Fuck me.

37:12.959 --> 37:16.833
"I've... I've ruined
her exercise.

37:16.834 --> 37:18.916
What's she gonna do to me now?"

37:18.917 --> 37:23.166
Can we get a tiny bit of perspective?

37:24.083 --> 37:26.582
"Natasha said..."

37:26.583 --> 37:30.082
"'That's the end of dice class.

37:30.083 --> 37:33.666
"'Belinda, seeing as
you came bottom,

37:33.667 --> 37:38.791
"'you must spend the rest
of the afternoon...

37:38.792 --> 37:42.208
"'topless.'"

37:51.458 --> 37:54.750
"Natasha took Belinda
by the elbow...

37:56.333 --> 38:00.499
...guided her to the edge of
the room and licked her face."

38:00.500 --> 38:02.624
Oh, God.

38:02.625 --> 38:04.916
- As you do.
- Why?

38:04.917 --> 38:07.917
I literally have no idea what's
going on in this fucking book.

38:08.750 --> 38:14.749
"Secretly, she pulled out a
box of Humphries Dice and Mice

38:14.750 --> 38:18.082
joke shop dice."

38:18.083 --> 38:21.499
My preferred brand.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.708
"And whispered..."

38:23.709 --> 38:26.791
- "'As you can see...'"
- MORTON: Whispered.

38:26.792 --> 38:29.124
"'As you can see,

38:29.125 --> 38:33.666
"'my box of dice
are from Humphries

38:33.667 --> 38:37.624
"'Dice and Mice
joke shop.

38:37.625 --> 38:40.792
"'Suppliers to royalty.'"

38:42.709 --> 38:45.082
It's very good.

38:45.083 --> 38:47.542
It's very, very good.

38:49.834 --> 38:55.374
"'Why, why
you... you, you... why, you..."

38:55.375 --> 38:57.416
That does not say that.

38:57.417 --> 38:58.749
Look.
Oh, it does say that.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.458
Get up, get up.
Get this line up.

39:03.166 --> 39:06.999
"'Why, why you...
you, you...

39:07.000 --> 39:10.999
"'why you, you...
you, why you.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.916
You switched the dice
when it was my turn.'"

39:16.917 --> 39:21.165
That is poetry.
That is beautiful.

39:21.166 --> 39:24.457
"'Natasha declared..."

39:24.458 --> 39:28.000
"'What do
you expect? I am a guru.'"

39:30.500 --> 39:36.082
"Lust and professional respect
pulsed through her body."

39:36.083 --> 39:39.125
Two very different emotions
all at...

39:40.375 --> 39:44.249
"It was as if Natasha could
taste it on her breath."

39:44.250 --> 39:48.791
Oh. Her breath? Have you
eaten lust and professional respect?

39:48.792 --> 39:51.416
Ooh, it's very strong.

39:51.417 --> 39:54.583
Does it repeat?
Is it like onions?

39:55.583 --> 39:59.040
"It was as if Natasha
could taste it on her breath,

39:59.041 --> 40:02.750
"because she slowly
pulled up her skirt...

40:04.959 --> 40:08.375
and flashed her cervix."

40:11.709 --> 40:13.291
Now...

40:15.458 --> 40:17.874
He has done this before.

40:17.875 --> 40:20.082
Dad doesn't know
what a cervix is.

40:20.083 --> 40:24.374
He thinks it's just another word
for vagina.

40:24.375 --> 40:26.833
And, I... Alice.

40:26.834 --> 40:29.541
This is a specific
pet peeve of yours.

40:29.542 --> 40:31.541
It should be a specific
pet peeve of all of ours.

40:31.542 --> 40:35.082
And it is, absolutely. But, I think
particularly, it's a bee in your bonnet.

40:35.083 --> 40:38.165
Yeah. Well, he does just
think that all of the lady bits

40:38.166 --> 40:41.916
are sort of jumbled up in a bag,
and they can kind of go anywhere.

40:41.917 --> 40:46.332
It feels like this would be a missed opportunity
to not clear it up once and for all,

40:46.333 --> 40:48.749
- so can I take two minutes of your time?
- Please.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.917
Please. Alice, you can take four.
Thanks. Okay.

40:56.083 --> 41:00.749
So it will surprise you to hear that we do
do some preparation before the show. I know.

41:00.750 --> 41:04.999
And we were reading this study,
because Rocky does really struggle...

41:05.000 --> 41:07.124
Yeah, he does.
...with female anatomy.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.541
But it turns out,
so do a lot of you.

41:09.542 --> 41:11.999
Because 50 percent
of millennial women

41:12.000 --> 41:13.708
don't know where
their vagina is.

41:13.709 --> 41:16.582
- That's real. That's not a joke.
- It's true. It's a true fact.

41:16.583 --> 41:18.624
This is not
a laughing matter. Okay?

41:18.625 --> 41:20.541
I don't mean they're like,
"Is it here?"

41:20.542 --> 41:23.457
I mean, they, like, don't know
which bit's which. So...

41:23.458 --> 41:26.290
What do you think
that top label is?

41:26.291 --> 41:27.917
They are the...?

41:29.959 --> 41:32.374
I said to the boys backstage, I had
a little peek through the curtain,

41:32.375 --> 41:36.124
I was like,
"We have a room full of FalTu fans."

41:36.125 --> 41:38.749
Yes. Fallopian tubes.
Okay.

41:38.750 --> 41:41.916
Brilliant. Okay. Next one down.
What are they?

41:41.917 --> 41:44.082
Ovaries!

41:44.083 --> 41:47.749
Okay, that was almost
unanimous, apart from a chap...

41:47.750 --> 41:50.582
I'm not gonna look at you, sir, 'cause
I don't want to embarrass anybody,

41:50.583 --> 41:54.583
but in this zone, who definitely
said lungs, but yes, that is...

41:55.917 --> 42:00.457
the... the lungs of the
reproductive system, if you like.

42:00.458 --> 42:01.874
That is the ovaries.

42:01.875 --> 42:04.416
Sir, please be careful.
You are gonna kill someone.

42:04.417 --> 42:06.666
Um... next one down.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.290
I'll give you a little clue.

42:08.291 --> 42:12.374
It's the team player.
You can't spell this without "us."

42:12.375 --> 42:15.082
Yes, it's the uterus.
You betcha.

42:15.083 --> 42:18.040
Um, okay, bottom right, sir,
that's not what it's called.

42:18.041 --> 42:21.165
What is the bottom right one?

42:21.166 --> 42:24.249
Did someone say banana?

42:24.250 --> 42:26.708
It's worse than I thought.
It's higher than 50 percent.

42:26.709 --> 42:28.833
That is the vagina. Okay.
So the last one...

42:28.834 --> 42:31.708
Let's just have just complete
silence for a second.

42:31.709 --> 42:34.749
Um, and I think on the count of
three, we could all do this together.

42:34.750 --> 42:38.791
Because I am gonna have a little
guess that this is not happening

42:38.792 --> 42:40.416
anywhere else in London tonight.

42:40.417 --> 42:42.874
Okay. So on the count
of three, as loudly...

42:42.875 --> 42:47.249
At the top of your lungs,
you might say, sir...

42:47.250 --> 42:49.416
Mind blown. Okay.

42:49.417 --> 42:51.791
Three, two, one...

42:51.792 --> 42:54.207
Cervix!

42:54.208 --> 42:56.457
That was magical. I...

42:56.458 --> 42:58.457
Yeah.

42:58.458 --> 43:01.124
Yeah. Applaud yourselves.
Yeah.

43:01.125 --> 43:03.499
Because you just made
me come, so thank you.

43:03.500 --> 43:06.542
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

43:13.959 --> 43:15.833
Alice Levine.
Fucking respect.

43:15.834 --> 43:17.416
- That was good.
- Thanks.

43:17.417 --> 43:20.582
"The team couldn't
believe their luck,

43:20.583 --> 43:26.916
"as Natasha and Belinda
unbuttoned their blouses,

43:26.917 --> 43:29.791
"unhooked their brassieres,

43:29.792 --> 43:33.125
and let their respective
tits hang out."

43:34.458 --> 43:36.624
Yes.

43:36.625 --> 43:38.499
Respective tits?

43:38.500 --> 43:42.165
These are my tits.
Those are your tits.

43:42.166 --> 43:45.999
"Within seconds,
a somewhat flushed-ish..."

43:46.000 --> 43:48.082
Oh!

43:48.083 --> 43:50.874
That's, although stupid,
quite nice, "flushed-ish."

43:50.875 --> 43:52.791
- Oh, it's ever so nice to say.
- Flushed-ish.

43:52.792 --> 43:55.040
"Within seconds,
a somewhat flushed-ish

43:55.041 --> 43:58.667
"Patrick O'Hamlin
stood up and said...

43:59.875 --> 44:03.207
"'Hey!"

44:03.208 --> 44:08.041
"'Hey, listen to me.
I got the straight sixes.

44:09.208 --> 44:13.375
"'I'm strippin' off, too.'"
COOPER: Oh.

44:14.542 --> 44:18.291
"Suddenly, Ken Dewsbury
piped up.

44:20.417 --> 44:24.500
"'Fuck it.'"

44:27.041 --> 44:32.499
"'Fuck it. I did no better
than ladies.

44:32.500 --> 44:38.249
- "'I reckon I should be balled naked, too.'"
- LEVINE: Balled naked?

44:38.250 --> 44:41.249
"Then, unbelievably,

44:41.250 --> 44:43.916
"keeping true to his word,

44:43.917 --> 44:48.542
Ken Dewsbury removed
all of his clothes."

44:49.542 --> 44:54.749
I don't want to see it.
"He folded them carefully."

44:54.750 --> 44:56.582
Drink.

44:56.583 --> 44:59.333
Although, I think that's
sexy and respectful.

45:00.083 --> 45:04.541
"He folded them carefully on one
of the wing-backed chairs..."

45:04.542 --> 45:07.792
- Yes.
- That's another drink, isn't it?

45:08.417 --> 45:12.624
"...sitting around the edge of
the recently vacuumed room."

45:12.625 --> 45:15.625
Yeah.

45:17.667 --> 45:23.749
"He then... took care...
to sit on his socks..."

45:23.750 --> 45:28.124
"...so as to not..."

45:28.125 --> 45:31.417
Oh, God,
I don't like it when you pause.

45:32.083 --> 45:34.959
- "...soil the soft furnishings."
- Oh...

45:36.750 --> 45:40.583
Mm. Mm-mm, mm.
Has... Has Ken done a poo?

45:42.959 --> 45:46.124
- Sorry, because he's about to...
- Shit himself,

45:46.125 --> 45:48.374
- or he has... Shit himself?
- I don't know.

45:48.375 --> 45:49.958
Okay, okay.
It doesn't say.

45:49.959 --> 45:51.457
It doesn't really matter, does it?
Really doesn't matter.

45:51.458 --> 45:53.416
It's a moot point.
Shit's coming either way.

45:53.417 --> 45:55.792
Right. Yep.

45:57.041 --> 46:00.874
"Des Martin, never one
to be caught out,

46:00.875 --> 46:05.833
immediately stripped down
to his black thong."

46:05.834 --> 46:08.332
Oh!

46:08.333 --> 46:11.457
I don't care how many times he
writes it, it's not catching on.

46:11.458 --> 46:14.082
Although, in the room tonight, I felt
like there was a lot of support for that.

46:14.083 --> 46:18.208
Let's say 80 percent of the men
are wearing black thongs tonight.

46:19.709 --> 46:24.208
"Natasha thought the session
was going rather well."

46:24.667 --> 46:26.875
What was the criteria?

46:27.542 --> 46:29.750
"Belinda was delighted."

46:31.750 --> 46:34.875
"Dave Wilcox was confused."

46:37.542 --> 46:42.458
"But he promptly stripped off,
for he was a businessman."

46:44.417 --> 46:48.750
And that's what they do, is it?
Yeah. I guess.

46:49.375 --> 46:52.207
"Natasha's
fuckably-shaped breasts..."

46:52.208 --> 46:54.290
Aah?

46:54.291 --> 46:57.874
Don't answer this, either of you.
Just think about it.

46:57.875 --> 47:00.290
What shape are they?

47:00.291 --> 47:02.708
What shape is
a fuckably-shaped breast?

47:02.709 --> 47:05.125
Is it like, a...
Don't answer it.

47:07.125 --> 47:09.708
"Natasha's
fuckably-shaped breasts

47:09.709 --> 47:12.582
"echoed..."

47:12.583 --> 47:14.541
Ga-doon, Ga-doon,
Ga-doon, Ga-doon...

47:14.542 --> 47:16.708
Like one of those,
you know, those exec toys,

47:16.709 --> 47:19.709
that people have on their desks?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:22.250 --> 47:27.207
"Natasha's fuckably-shaped
breasts echoed the maturity

47:27.208 --> 47:30.582
"of her tanned, rounded body,

47:30.583 --> 47:34.458
and good, sturdy legs."

47:36.041 --> 47:38.999
- Sturdy legs, as well?
- Yeah.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.082
Is that sexy? Sturdy legs?
Sturdy legs.

47:41.083 --> 47:45.083
Do you look at somebody like, "Ooh,
I bet she can stand up for hours."

47:46.375 --> 47:49.583
She doesn't look like she needs a chair.

47:51.750 --> 47:56.416
"It was all too much
for Des Martin.

47:56.417 --> 47:58.958
"He simply had to have Belinda,

47:58.959 --> 48:01.667
team building session or no."

48:04.375 --> 48:08.875
"He reached over and pulled
down the boss's knickers."

48:11.458 --> 48:13.290
I just like that
as a turn of phrase.

48:13.291 --> 48:16.250
"You think you're
the boss's knickers, don't you."

48:16.959 --> 48:20.625
Everyone in the room
gasped at his cheek."

48:22.000 --> 48:25.499
Very good.
"And they waited.

48:25.500 --> 48:29.000
Boy, did they wait"

48:29.625 --> 48:34.959
for the slap on the face
he so truly deserved."

48:36.667 --> 48:39.457
"It never came."

48:39.458 --> 48:41.708
Is there no justice?

48:41.709 --> 48:45.124
"Belinda turned 'round

48:45.125 --> 48:48.499
- "and kissed Des Martin..."
- Aw.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.416
- "...deeply..."
- That's nice.

48:50.417 --> 48:54.041
"...on his cock."

49:02.834 --> 49:05.749
- That's really cool.
- That's really cool.

49:05.750 --> 49:08.124
That's cool. That's the
coolest thing I've ever heard.

49:08.125 --> 49:10.041
Isn't that
the coolest thing ever?

49:10.750 --> 49:14.165
How... How do you kiss
someone deeply on the cock?

49:14.166 --> 49:17.333
You tell me.

49:18.500 --> 49:22.291
Tongue down the urethra? I don't know...
Oh, you're gonna answer?

49:23.667 --> 49:25.874
You just... Wow.
It's a guess!

49:25.875 --> 49:29.165
That is the most Rocky thing
you've ever said.

49:29.166 --> 49:32.374
You answered so quickly.
Why didn't you give it a beat?

49:32.375 --> 49:35.999
Pretend you've just
thought of it. Here's what I like:

49:36.000 --> 49:38.333
"Tongue down the urethra."

49:39.500 --> 49:41.499
What a perfect
impression of me.

49:41.500 --> 49:44.125
"Here's what I like.
Tongue down urethra."

49:45.875 --> 49:49.749
"She opened her mouth wide
and took him in."

49:49.750 --> 49:52.040
- Oh!
- Took him in?

49:52.041 --> 49:55.207
That's... "Are you cold?"

49:55.208 --> 49:58.207
"Come on. Do you need somewhere
to stay for the night?"

49:58.208 --> 50:01.750
Stop pointing so much.
We can find it. Thank you.

50:03.834 --> 50:06.916
"...opened her mouth wide
and took him in,

50:06.917 --> 50:09.666
"in one gulp."
Oh, my God.

50:09.667 --> 50:14.917
Has she swallowed his cock? She's,
like, shucked him back like an oyster.

50:17.208 --> 50:19.791
"Des Martin screamed."

50:19.792 --> 50:22.416
- I'll bet he did.
- "I'm not surprised."

50:22.417 --> 50:23.750
"Where's my cock?"

50:26.500 --> 50:30.499
"I had it this morning."

50:30.500 --> 50:33.582
Oh, my God.
Oh, hang on. Sorry. No.

50:33.583 --> 50:37.666
I read it wrong... ish.

50:37.667 --> 50:42.624
"Des Martin screamed
in ecstasy."

50:42.625 --> 50:46.290
Oh. Okay. No, I beg to differ.
I don't think he did.

50:46.291 --> 50:48.125
That sounds aw...
It sounds horrific.

50:49.709 --> 50:52.125
"And..." Fuck.

50:53.291 --> 50:55.583
"...white...

50:56.166 --> 50:59.458
"...semen..."

51:01.291 --> 51:05.709
"...dribbled down
Belinda's throat."

51:08.834 --> 51:11.166
Eww-agh! Okay.

51:13.625 --> 51:15.959
Oh, God.

51:23.875 --> 51:26.207
Would it be...?

51:26.208 --> 51:29.165
I'm literally,
I'm... I'm a wreck.

51:29.166 --> 51:32.040
I'm a wreck of a man.

51:32.041 --> 51:34.833
Your dad... Yeah.
I know!

51:34.834 --> 51:38.165
No, you know. You know. You know.
I don't need to say it. You know, so...

51:38.166 --> 51:40.374
God.
Is it...

51:40.375 --> 51:43.999
a bad time to just ask you to reread the
last line... just recap the last line?

51:44.000 --> 51:47.542
Really? I can't remember
the exact wording of the...

51:48.583 --> 51:50.166
Okay, fine.

51:51.208 --> 51:53.833
"Des Martin screamed
in ecstasy

51:53.834 --> 51:57.374
as white semen dribbled down
Belinda's throat."

51:57.375 --> 52:00.499
Mm. It's no better
on second hearing.

52:00.500 --> 52:03.040
I thought
it might have mellowed.

52:03.041 --> 52:07.999
"Patrick O' Hamlin
could wait no longer.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.542
With a mighty leap and a bound,
he cleared the table..."

52:13.542 --> 52:14.874
Spiderman.

52:14.875 --> 52:18.999
"...catching Natasha
by the breasts."

52:19.000 --> 52:21.374
She's not a climbing wall!

52:21.375 --> 52:25.959
"He threw her onto the
exquisitely laid parquet floors."

52:28.417 --> 52:32.165
"There, writhing
in expectation,

52:32.166 --> 52:36.166
"Patrick O'Hamlin entered her
vagina and tickled her labia."

52:37.875 --> 52:39.666
He "entered her."

52:39.667 --> 52:42.040
It sounds like
he kind of went, like...

52:42.041 --> 52:44.499
with one of those
head torches on.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.624
Yep. Yep.
Good in here.

52:46.625 --> 52:49.708
If you knock that down,
that's... that's the partition.

52:49.709 --> 52:51.792
That pelvic floor,
that can come up.

52:53.208 --> 52:56.582
"Natasha opened her legs wider."

52:56.583 --> 52:59.249
Well, she'd have to. There's a whole
man up there, doing...

52:59.250 --> 53:02.249
...quite an extensive
renovation.

53:02.250 --> 53:08.416
- "And pulled Patrick even deeper into her rampant body."
- Oh, shit!

53:08.417 --> 53:12.250
So it's just a pair of shoes?
Like this. Yeah.

53:14.750 --> 53:18.082
"Meanwhile..."

53:18.083 --> 53:22.249
Back at the office...
"Meanwhile..."

53:22.250 --> 53:24.916
"Des Martin returned
Belinda's mouth

53:24.917 --> 53:29.040
- to his now reinvigorated penis."
- Oh, lovely.

53:29.041 --> 53:32.417
"And started to screw her
politely.

53:36.959 --> 53:40.834
Oh, no, please.
After you. May I?

53:42.083 --> 53:46.083
"Ken Dewsbury had set about
entering Belinda,

53:46.792 --> 53:49.666
and he started to fuck her
with gusto."

53:49.667 --> 53:51.999
- Oh...
- Gusto?

53:52.000 --> 53:55.749
Is that, like...
<i>♪ Ba-da-da dah! ♪</i>

53:55.750 --> 53:58.624
No, that's pizzazz.
Oh.

53:58.625 --> 54:00.833
Gusto, Pizzazz.
There's a fine line.

54:00.834 --> 54:03.166
You do always
get them confused.

54:04.917 --> 54:08.874
"This all left an ever so
bewildered Dave Wilcox,

54:08.875 --> 54:13.082
- who quickly squatted on Natasha's face..."
- Oh, my God.

54:13.083 --> 54:18.582
Don't do it quickly. No. That's a
thing to take your time over, isn't it?

54:18.583 --> 54:21.291
She'll have
two black eyes. Aah!

54:22.083 --> 54:25.041
Just like a... boom!
Ooh!

54:26.208 --> 54:30.125
"...enabling her
to chew his testicles."

54:33.291 --> 54:37.333
This is really rough.
This is horrible, horrible...

54:37.709 --> 54:41.999
I don't want to speak for the
male experience, but I'm gonna...

54:42.000 --> 54:46.332
Look at James! He's like,
protecting himself.

54:46.333 --> 54:49.833
Using your teeth
to chew on a testicle,

54:49.834 --> 54:52.165
I'm just gonna say that might hurt.
It's not advisable, yeah.

54:52.166 --> 54:56.374
It'd be like biting into a pickled
onion, wouldn't it?

54:56.375 --> 54:58.040
- Oh, my God.
- Why?

54:58.041 --> 55:00.582
Why so vinegary?

55:00.583 --> 55:04.207
Not the taste.
The texture, you loon!

55:04.208 --> 55:10.916
"He growled in pleasure..."
He didn't. He just didn't.

55:10.917 --> 55:14.792
"...waiting for Patrick O'Hamlin
to drain himself."

55:16.375 --> 55:18.874
I've never been
more upset by a verb.

55:18.875 --> 55:21.666
That's disgusting, isn't it?

55:21.667 --> 55:25.000
Draining himself into,
like, a husk.

55:26.625 --> 55:30.541
"...waiting for Patrick O'Hamlin
to drain himself..."

55:30.542 --> 55:32.874
Stop saying,
"To drain himself."

55:32.875 --> 55:36.917
"...so he could release his
big, throbbing cock into..."

55:37.041 --> 55:42.208
Into the wild.

55:43.166 --> 55:45.999
Be free!
Actual Free Willy.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.667
Oh, my God!

55:51.083 --> 55:54.082
- Very good. Very good.
- That's good.

55:54.083 --> 55:57.750
It's a very different film.

55:58.917 --> 56:03.541
"...so he could fully release
his big, throbbing cock

56:03.542 --> 56:06.625
into Natasha's
womanly creases."

56:09.792 --> 56:12.040
Womanly creases?

56:12.041 --> 56:15.416
- That's actually quite good.
- Is it?

56:15.417 --> 56:20.000
Sounds like he's jizzed in her
back fat or something. Oh, James!

56:22.583 --> 56:25.750
Oh, thank you.

56:26.291 --> 56:30.291
Oh, my God.
Thank you for draining yourself.

56:31.125 --> 56:37.625
Oh, my God. "Jizzed in her back
fat." Wow. That is quite the image.

56:39.166 --> 56:42.583
"Belinda Blumenthal...

56:43.458 --> 56:49.165
"plopped Des Martin's
floppy phallus

56:49.166 --> 56:53.959
out of her jaws."

56:57.458 --> 57:01.165
How many people can honestly
say they're not turned on?

57:01.166 --> 57:03.999
I think you'd find it hard,
if you were being completely honest.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.333
Oh, my God. I don't think I'm
ever gonna have an erection again.

57:08.917 --> 57:12.874
So, "Belinda Blumenthal
plopped..." Plopped?

57:12.875 --> 57:15.249
Plopped! It wasn't even flopped.
Plopped.

57:15.250 --> 57:18.666
"...Des Martin's floppy
phallus out of her jaws

57:18.667 --> 57:21.959
"as she watched her
knackered colleagues."

57:24.166 --> 57:26.249
"Her mind got in touch..."

57:26.250 --> 57:30.166
Yes!

57:31.000 --> 57:34.624
Hiya!

57:34.625 --> 57:40.375
"Her mind got in touch to say,
'Eighteen grand well spent.'"

57:41.667 --> 57:43.666
- Eighteen grand?
- Yeah.

57:43.667 --> 57:45.791
That's the most disgusting
part of this whole chapter.

57:45.792 --> 57:49.499
This whole...
I mean, car crash.

57:49.500 --> 57:52.457
- Eighteen grand on what? On some dice?
- Eighteen grand.

57:52.458 --> 57:54.374
Mainly the cleanup,
I imagine.

57:54.375 --> 57:57.624
They had to just burn
the whole thing down.

57:57.625 --> 58:00.833
Getting shit out of upholstery is...
is difficult.

58:00.834 --> 58:04.833
So... so I've heard.

58:04.834 --> 58:08.166
Anecdotally.

58:09.834 --> 58:12.374
- Everyone?
- What?

58:12.375 --> 58:14.457
- "Belinda blinked."
- Yes!

58:14.458 --> 58:17.917
Ah!

58:19.291 --> 58:22.959
And that, thank fuck...

58:24.458 --> 58:28.834
- is the end of the chapter.
- Aw!

58:33.750 --> 58:35.250
Good effort.

58:37.917 --> 58:39.709
Wow.

58:47.458 --> 58:50.416
So, really, there's only
one thing left to do.

58:50.417 --> 58:53.958
Um, and that's thank the man...
the mystery.

58:53.959 --> 58:56.791
The monster.
Yes.

58:56.792 --> 59:01.249
My dad.

59:01.250 --> 59:03.750
Please, guys.
Be upstanding...

59:06.917 --> 59:10.958
...to the great
Rocky Flintstone!

59:10.959 --> 59:14.624
To Rocky Flintstone.
To Rocky Flintstone. Cheers.

59:14.625 --> 59:18.499
To Rocky. To Rocky.
Cheers. Cheers.

59:18.500 --> 59:20.625
Cheers.
Cheers.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.082
Thank you guys so, so much for
coming out! You've been amazing!

59:25.083 --> 59:29.791
We have been My Dad Wrote a Porno.
You have all been perverts.

59:29.792 --> 59:32.124
Thank you, and good night.

59:32.125 --> 59:35.667
Woo!
