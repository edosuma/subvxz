WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:06.875
(Mary Ann)
You still haven't told me
when the commander's due back.

00:06.958 --> 00:09.000
- Soon.
- How soon is soon?

00:09.083 --> 00:11.500
Longer than a little while.
Faster than later.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.667
He took out a fighter to check
out a damaged transport.

00:13.750 --> 00:16.500
Isn't that sort of job usually
delegated to someone else?

00:16.583 --> 00:18.125
Commander's a hands-on
kind a guy.

00:18.208 --> 00:20.292
He'll grab any chance
to take out a ship.

00:20.375 --> 00:22.417
- He's like that.
- Well, I wouldn't know.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.375
I haven't seen him
since I came aboard.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.625
Have you ever tried
one of these?

00:27.708 --> 00:29.292
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

00:29.375 --> 00:30.917
According to the translator
it's either

00:31.000 --> 00:32.833
an aphrodisiac
or a floor wax.

00:32.917 --> 00:34.542
Can't decide if it's
worth the risk or not.

00:34.625 --> 00:37.917
- Mr. Garibaldi--
- Please. Michael.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.083
Did I mention I really
enjoy your broadcasts?

00:41.167 --> 00:43.125
You know, if this interview
hadn't been set up weeks ago

00:43.208 --> 00:44.625
by Earthforce Public Relations

00:44.708 --> 00:46.333
I'd swear that
Commander Sinclair

00:46.417 --> 00:47.625
did not want
to be interviewed

00:47.708 --> 00:50.167
by Interstellar Network news.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.583
I can't imagine that.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.125
This is supposed to be an event.

00:53.208 --> 00:57.792
This is the second anniversary
of Babylon 5 going online.

00:57.875 --> 00:59.958
We took a poll when this station
first opened

01:00.042 --> 01:02.042
and 75 percent of ISN viewers

01:02.125 --> 01:05.292
said that this place
wouldn't even last five minutes.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.917
Lloyd's of London put the odds
of this station surviving

01:08.000 --> 01:12.667
even one year
at 500 to one...against.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.958
Is there a bathroom
around here?

01:18.042 --> 01:19.792
Third door to your left.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.375
That way.

01:25.250 --> 01:28.583
The one with the blue marker
is for methane breathers only.

01:28.667 --> 01:30.625
I'd steer clear if I were you.

01:32.667 --> 01:34.667
What the hell.

01:37.875 --> 01:41.833
If that thing leaves a waxy
yellow build-up on anything

01:41.917 --> 01:43.375
I'm coming back here.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.917
[instrumental music]

01:49.875 --> 01:52.167
Julie, hand me
that separator over there

01:52.250 --> 01:55.125
I've just about got
the RNA strand where I want it.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.500
Get it yourself.

01:58.583 --> 02:01.542
Vance, what are you doing here?

02:01.625 --> 02:02.750
I was in the sector.

02:02.833 --> 02:03.917
I thought I'd stop by

02:04.000 --> 02:06.875
and visit my favorite student.

02:08.625 --> 02:11.417
I've come to offer you
an adventure, Stephen

02:11.500 --> 02:15.042
very possibly the biggest
adventure you've ever had.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.750
What kind of adventure?

02:17.833 --> 02:19.625
Well, you'll find out
soon enough.

02:22.250 --> 02:25.333
Savor the mystery, Stephen.

02:25.417 --> 02:27.542
We don't get nearly enough
of them.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.125
Tired?

02:36.208 --> 02:38.042
Yeah, long day.

02:38.125 --> 02:41.750
But your ship's the last one in,
so anything to declare, uh..

02:41.833 --> 02:45.958
...any plants, non-sentient
pets, organic matter..

02:46.042 --> 02:49.750
Nothing organic, just some
pottery and stone work.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.333
Hmm, funny thing.

02:52.417 --> 02:54.208
The bottom of this box
on the inside

02:54.292 --> 02:55.875
is four inches shorter
than the bottom

02:55.958 --> 02:57.917
of the box on the outside

02:58.000 --> 03:01.083
like there was
a hidden compartment in here.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.583
If I didn't know better,
I might think

03:02.667 --> 03:05.125
you were trying
to smuggle something in.

03:05.208 --> 03:06.542
Not a chance.

03:06.625 --> 03:09.833
No, it's just packing material
to protect the stuff.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.667
Here, let me show you.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.417
[dramatic music]

03:32.833 --> 03:36.250
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind

03:36.333 --> 03:39.583
ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

03:39.667 --> 03:42.958
The Babylon Project
was a dream, given form.

03:43.042 --> 03:45.083
It's goal,
to prevent another war

03:45.167 --> 03:47.708
by creating a place
where humans and aliens

03:47.792 --> 03:50.542
could work out
their differences peacefully.

03:50.625 --> 03:53.292
It's a port of call,
home away from home

03:53.375 --> 03:58.417
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs, and wanderers.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.958
Human and aliens
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

04:03.042 --> 04:06.875
of spinning metal
all alone in the night.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.417
It can be a dangerous place

04:10.500 --> 04:13.708
but it's our last best hope
for peace.

04:13.792 --> 04:15.625
This is the story of the last

04:15.708 --> 04:17.583
of the Babylon stations.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.917
The year is 2258.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.875
The name of the place
is "Babylon 5."

04:28.875 --> 04:31.917
[theme music]

05:04.583 --> 05:06.167
(Sinclair)
How does it look?

05:06.250 --> 05:09.542
All the signs point to death
by natural causes

05:09.625 --> 05:10.958
heart attack
from the look of it.

05:11.042 --> 05:13.542
- That suddenly?
- I mean, it's possible.

05:13.625 --> 05:16.875
I'll know more
after we do an autopsy.

05:16.958 --> 05:18.125
Did you know him?

05:18.208 --> 05:20.708
No, he just started
the other day.

05:21.833 --> 05:23.042
Nothing in his personnel jacket

05:23.125 --> 05:25.875
'to suggest
a heart condition.'

05:25.958 --> 05:29.083
Yes, and exactly
which medical school

05:29.167 --> 05:30.708
did you attend, Mr. Garibaldi?

05:30.792 --> 05:34.667
Nothing personal, doc.
I just want to be sure.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.750
So do I.

05:36.833 --> 05:38.417
I'll assign my best people
to the autopsy.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.917
Fair enough? Good.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.708
Meanwhile, if I were you, I
would go on with work as usual

05:43.792 --> 05:45.417
and as soon
as I hear of anything definitive

05:45.500 --> 05:47.167
I'll let you know.

05:47.250 --> 05:48.958
Go ahead and remove
the body now.

05:53.708 --> 05:55.125
[instrumental music]

05:56.667 --> 05:59.250
Sorry, we had a little problem
at one of the docking bays.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.417
Now, would you like to tell me
what this is all about?

06:02.500 --> 06:04.625
I need your help.

06:04.708 --> 06:06.542
[chuckles]
Vance, you're an archeologist.

06:06.625 --> 06:09.958
Everything you touch has been
dead at least 100 years.

06:10.042 --> 06:14.083
My area of expertise is a little
more current and a lot warmer.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.125
All in good time.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.625
Firstly, I'd like to introduce

06:16.708 --> 06:18.167
you to my assistant.

06:19.292 --> 06:21.792
'Nelson,
meet Dr. Stephen Franklin'

06:21.875 --> 06:24.583
one of the best
students I ever had.

06:24.667 --> 06:28.667
Well, in the area of alien
history, anatomy, and culture.

06:28.750 --> 06:29.875
Pleasure.

06:29.958 --> 06:31.292
Dr. Hendricks
told me all about you

06:31.375 --> 06:33.417
on our way in
from our dig on Ikarra VII.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.583
Dig?

06:36.667 --> 06:38.458
You found something.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.083
Show him.

06:44.792 --> 06:45.708
That's funny.

06:45.792 --> 06:46.958
I just had an energy spike

06:47.042 --> 06:48.083
on my screen.

06:48.167 --> 06:49.083
Same here.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.625
What's the location?

06:50.708 --> 06:52.792
I thought it was around med lab.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.292
I'm not sure.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.250
It was just there for a second.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.167
Might have been
a malfunction in the screen.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.708
You'd better run
a diagnostics check to be sure.

07:01.792 --> 07:04.208
Will do.

07:04.292 --> 07:07.458
We were on a dig sponsored
by Interplanetary Expeditions

07:07.542 --> 07:10.667
'when we found these artifacts
sealed in a vault'

07:10.750 --> 07:14.000
buried nearly a mile beneath
the surface of Ikarra VII.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.500
Took us months to get them out.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.458
But Ikarra VII is a dead world.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.833
Yes, but don't you see, that
proves what I've been saying

07:19.917 --> 07:22.000
'for years
that Ikarra was once home'

07:22.083 --> 07:25.167
'to a highly advanced
space-fairing society.'

07:29.042 --> 07:30.917
Extraordinary.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.208
How old are they?

07:32.292 --> 07:34.500
Minimum of 1000 years.

07:34.583 --> 07:38.583
No chips, no sign
of wear or age.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.667
'It's as if they
were made yesterday.'

07:41.750 --> 07:43.958
What were they made to do?

07:44.042 --> 07:45.875
Well, that's where you come in.

07:45.958 --> 07:48.083
- Oh, Vance, I told--
- I know, I know.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.917
Humor me.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.417
Put it in your medical scanner.

07:57.125 --> 08:00.125
[buzzing]

08:01.875 --> 08:03.292
(Stephen)
'Whoa.'

08:05.458 --> 08:08.625
'You've veins, capillaries,
traces of DNA.'

08:08.708 --> 08:12.208
Vance...this artifact
is composed of living tissue.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.000
This is organic technology.

08:14.083 --> 08:17.375
The one trick that Earth
hasn't yet been able to crack.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.208
The ability to create
living ships that thrive

08:20.292 --> 08:22.208
in the vacuum of space

08:22.292 --> 08:24.375
to create weapons
that produce their own power

08:24.458 --> 08:26.750
'through internal generation'

08:26.833 --> 08:29.625
like a firefly
lights up at night.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.917
The ultimate synthesis
of machine technology

08:33.000 --> 08:34.833
and living tissue.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.292
Magnificent.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.333
This had to be
a scanner of some kind.

08:40.417 --> 08:44.667
See the way the entire surface
tissue is photosensitive.

08:44.750 --> 08:48.333
Retinal cones and rods to detect
wide-band light frequencies.

08:48.417 --> 08:50.250
This is amazing!

08:50.333 --> 08:51.500
Why didn't you come and see me

08:51.583 --> 08:53.250
about this when you
first arrived?

08:53.333 --> 08:55.917
I did. We've only
been here a few hours.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.667
But organic material has to be
quarantined for 48 hours

08:58.750 --> 09:00.333
before it's allowed
in the station.

09:00.417 --> 09:03.625
Yeah, we put it all through
quarantine at the other end

09:03.708 --> 09:05.958
at the transfer station
off Proxima III.

09:06.042 --> 09:07.625
It's all approved
and authorized.

09:07.708 --> 09:10.958
Nelson has all the paperwork
if you're really interested.

09:11.042 --> 09:13.500
Don't you see what this means?

09:13.583 --> 09:17.625
This is a blueprint
for living machines.

09:17.708 --> 09:19.417
The Vorlons have them.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.958
Some people even say
the Minbari have them.

09:22.042 --> 09:23.792
We haven't seen
enough of them up close

09:23.875 --> 09:25.875
to get any idea of how they work

09:25.958 --> 09:30.250
but with your expertise
in xenobiology and genetics

09:30.333 --> 09:32.125
and my background
in archeology

09:32.208 --> 09:34.250
'we now have the chance.'

09:36.000 --> 09:39.458
Well, there are better equipped
facilities back on Earth.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.875
I need someone I can trust.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.625
You once told me
back at the university

09:46.708 --> 09:49.875
that you wanted your name
to go down in history

09:49.958 --> 09:53.667
alongside Fleming, Salk,
Jenner..

09:54.542 --> 09:56.417
'...Takahashi.'

09:56.500 --> 09:58.000
Well, this is it, Stephen.

09:58.083 --> 10:01.250
This is the mother load.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.750
'I can't do it without you.
I need your help.'

10:06.750 --> 10:09.125
'So are you in or out?'

10:15.500 --> 10:17.833
Finish unpacking, Nelson.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.750
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.292
[dramatic music]

10:51.292 --> 10:53.000
[zapping]

10:53.083 --> 10:55.417
Oh.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.667
[screaming]

11:00.583 --> 11:02.625
[music continues]

11:06.333 --> 11:09.208
[instrumental music]

11:26.167 --> 11:28.917
[intense music]

11:34.750 --> 11:36.042
(Garibaldi)
Oh, there you are, chief.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.625
Any word on the autopsy yet?

11:37.708 --> 11:40.042
Techs down at med lab 4 still
think it's natural causes.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.250
We'll know more tomorrow.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.500
'Other than that,
we've scheduled

11:42.583 --> 11:44.083
'a full security detail
to cover'

11:44.167 --> 11:47.625
the Narn-Centauri negotiations
next Tuesday. That's it.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.750
- I think we can call it a day.
- I agree.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.292
How about you,
lieutenant commander?

11:51.375 --> 11:52.833
Shouldn't the night shift
be on duty by now?

11:52.917 --> 11:54.708
We've been picking up
some unusual energy readings

11:54.792 --> 11:55.917
the last few hours.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.042
I thought I'd wait around
a little

11:57.125 --> 11:58.125
to see if it happens again.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.250
Anything serious?

11:59.333 --> 12:00.708
That's what
I'm trying to find out.

12:00.792 --> 12:03.833
Well, keep me informed,
and get some sleep.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.292
I will.

12:05.375 --> 12:06.958
Oh, just a reminder.

12:07.042 --> 12:09.542
Your interview's scheduled
for 1100 hours tomorrow.

12:09.625 --> 12:10.958
Swell.

12:11.042 --> 12:12.625
Which reminds me,
she's waiting for me

12:12.708 --> 12:14.167
down in the Zovolo.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.417
It will be fun.
So, why are you ducking her?

12:16.500 --> 12:18.000
The last time
I gave an interview

12:18.083 --> 12:19.208
they told me to just relax

12:19.292 --> 12:21.375
'and say what I really felt.'

12:21.458 --> 12:24.292
Ten minutes after the broadcast,
I got transferred to an outpost

12:24.375 --> 12:26.292
so far off the star maps,
you couldn't have find it

12:26.375 --> 12:28.750
with a hunting dog
and a Ouija board.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.042
Don't sweat it.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.333
Just be that charming

12:31.417 --> 12:32.500
effervescent commander

12:32.583 --> 12:34.333
we've all come
to know and love.

12:34.417 --> 12:35.625
'What's the worst
that can happen?'

12:35.708 --> 12:36.667
They fire you,
ship you off to the rim

12:36.750 --> 12:38.167
and I get promoted to commander.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.667
I don't see a problem here.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.583
How sharper
than a serpent's tooth.

12:44.167 --> 12:46.958
All this technology,
you think there'd be a clock.

12:48.667 --> 12:52.042
[sighs]
Stephen, it's been 15 hours.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.542
'We're gonna grow old
and die in here.'

12:55.833 --> 12:58.167
Stephen.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.000
'Stephen, there's a Martian war
machine parked outside.'

13:01.083 --> 13:04.833
They'd like a word with you
about the common cold.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.917
Tell them to make
an appointment.

13:11.542 --> 13:12.542
[sighs]

13:12.625 --> 13:13.958
Ohh.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.458
You know, something's been
bothering me

13:17.542 --> 13:19.208
ever since you've got here.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.083
Assuming that we can figure out

13:23.167 --> 13:24.875
how this organic technology
works

13:24.958 --> 13:26.375
what happens then?

13:26.458 --> 13:28.125
We apply for a secondary patent

13:28.208 --> 13:29.708
based on alien technology

13:29.792 --> 13:31.042
sell it to an Earth corporation

13:31.125 --> 13:32.667
for a percentage
of the profits.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.625
(Stephen)
'Well, that's what
I'm talking about.'

13:34.708 --> 13:37.708
You're a brilliant man, Vance,
a solid researcher.

13:37.792 --> 13:40.250
You were an inspiration to me
back at university.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.208
You should be out making
your own discoveries

13:42.292 --> 13:45.250
instead of raiding dead worlds
for whatever you can scavenge

13:45.333 --> 13:47.250
and sell to the corporation.

13:47.333 --> 13:50.375
Right, struggling
through mountains of paper

13:50.458 --> 13:52.792
vanishing grants.
Who has time for that?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.208
Exactly. That's my point.

14:00.417 --> 14:02.292
Granted, this,
this may be important

14:02.375 --> 14:03.875
but you wouldn't
have created it.

14:03.958 --> 14:08.458
You just found it.
It's a, it's a shortcut.

14:08.542 --> 14:11.250
Frankly, I'm a little
uncomfortable about corporations

14:11.333 --> 14:13.167
financing expeditions
to alien worlds

14:13.250 --> 14:16.083
so they can steal whatever
technology they have.

14:16.167 --> 14:18.250
Feels a little like
grave robbing.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.583
Do you know what it costs to
mount an off-world expedition?

14:21.667 --> 14:26.083
[scoffs]
More money than a university
professor makes in a lifetime.

14:26.167 --> 14:29.833
If the corporations
won't pay, who will?

14:29.917 --> 14:31.917
In the last five years

14:32.000 --> 14:36.167
I've seen things off-world
you can't even imagine.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.333
I've stood in the Abendi desert,
and watched all seven moons

14:39.417 --> 14:41.375
go into eclipse.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.375
I've walked in vaults
that have been sealed

14:43.458 --> 14:45.292
longer than has been
a human race

14:45.375 --> 14:47.958
breathing air that's
five million years old.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.333
'You call that a shortcut
if you will..'

14:53.542 --> 14:55.833
...but I've lived.

14:55.917 --> 15:00.292
By God, Stephen, I have lived.

15:00.375 --> 15:02.458
At least my hands are clean.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.208
How about yours?

15:04.292 --> 15:06.625
What's that supposed to mean?

15:06.708 --> 15:09.000
Who is
Interplanetary Expeditions?

15:09.083 --> 15:10.625
You said they were fronting
this expedition

15:10.708 --> 15:13.667
but I checked, I can't find
any information on them.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.792
Look, Stephen

15:15.875 --> 15:18.792
I didn't come halfway across
known space to argue with you.

15:18.875 --> 15:22.458
I came here because I wanted
your help and friendship.

15:22.542 --> 15:23.875
If that's too much of a burden--

15:23.958 --> 15:25.833
No, it is not.

15:25.917 --> 15:28.208
I just wish that you would stop
taking shortcuts.

15:28.292 --> 15:29.833
Look, we're both tired,
I suggest we get

15:29.917 --> 15:33.042
a good night's sleep and start
again tomorrow fresh.

15:33.125 --> 15:35.667
If you have any questions, then
I'll be glad to answer them.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.667
Fair enough?

15:37.750 --> 15:39.083
Yeah.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.167
(Garibaldi)
'And after walking 50 miles,
we made it out of the desert.'

15:46.250 --> 15:48.083
Later when he was put
in charge of Babylon 5

15:48.167 --> 15:50.583
Commander Sinclair
asked if I come work security.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.667
I said yes.
It's been a great time--

15:52.750 --> 15:54.417
Yes, I'm sure it has.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.125
In doing some research,
I've come across several rumors

15:57.208 --> 16:00.125
surrounding your record
prior to Babylon 5.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.708
That you were fired five times

16:01.792 --> 16:03.292
for unspecified
personal problems

16:03.375 --> 16:06.708
and that this is your last
chance to make good.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.375
Do you care to comment
on any of that?

16:08.458 --> 16:12.375
I'd rather have my tonsils
taken out through my ears.

16:15.250 --> 16:17.042
[dramatic music]

16:36.542 --> 16:39.333
[crackling]

17:06.333 --> 17:08.000
Lights.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.042
Nelson.

17:18.042 --> 17:19.500
Vance.

17:22.833 --> 17:23.917
My God.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.583
- Nelson, what happened?
- Protect.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.167
Aah!

17:33.375 --> 17:35.625
- 'When did it happen?'
- 'Sometime during the night.'

17:35.708 --> 17:37.917
(Garibaldi)
'They moved him to the infirmary
about an hour ago.'

17:38.000 --> 17:39.958
- What's his condition?
- Stunned, bumps and bruises.

17:40.042 --> 17:41.292
And one hell of a headache.

17:41.375 --> 17:43.500
Dr. Hernandez says it's okay
to ask a few questions

17:43.583 --> 17:46.125
as long as he gets his rest.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.667
(Sinclair)
'You shouldn't be
walking around yet.'

17:58.750 --> 18:01.708
[groans]
I'm the doctor.
I know what I'm doing.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.375
Whoa.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.125
On second thought..

18:06.208 --> 18:08.583
Do you remember anything else
after you walked in the door?

18:08.667 --> 18:10.500
[sighs]
Not much.

18:10.583 --> 18:13.125
I turned around,
and there he was, like I said.

18:14.833 --> 18:16.333
The design
of that weapon reminds me

18:16.417 --> 18:18.792
of the organic artifacts
we were working on.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.542
Organic?
Were they checked at customs?

18:21.625 --> 18:23.708
I was told they were.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.167
Check into it.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.208
This Nelson,
who is he working for?

18:27.292 --> 18:28.583
Vance Hendricks.

18:28.667 --> 18:31.542
The same one
who brought in the artifacts?

18:31.625 --> 18:33.292
Interesting.

18:34.083 --> 18:37.125
[breathing heavily]

18:39.292 --> 18:41.042
I still haven't heard
a satisfactory answer

18:41.125 --> 18:43.292
Dr. Hendricks,
and frankly I'm getting tired

18:43.375 --> 18:44.833
of asking for one.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.583
Dr. Franklin was attacked
by your assistant

18:47.667 --> 18:49.083
covered in some kind of armor

18:49.167 --> 18:50.708
that's bears
a striking similarity

18:50.792 --> 18:52.792
to the artifacts
you brought on to this station.

18:52.875 --> 18:55.583
Artifacts that were not
cleared for access.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.250
Organic material
requires a 48-hour quarantine.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.125
There's no record
of their being quarantined

19:00.208 --> 19:02.708
or examined here
or at Proxima III.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.125
I'm as much in the dark
as you are.

19:05.208 --> 19:08.208
Nelson told me that he checked
them. I believed him.

19:08.292 --> 19:10.208
Whether he was acting
under your orders or not

19:10.292 --> 19:12.292
a potentially
dangerous alien technology

19:12.375 --> 19:14.083
was smuggled
aboard this station.

19:14.167 --> 19:16.708
Now, until I hear otherwise,
I intend to hold you personally

19:16.792 --> 19:18.250
'responsible. Is that clear?'

19:18.333 --> 19:20.042
Yes, yes, yes, it is.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.375
Uh, is there any news
of Stephen's condition?

19:22.458 --> 19:24.375
They're checking him out over
at med lab 4.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.500
He took a pretty bad hit!

19:27.667 --> 19:29.208
But I'm told
he's going to be okay.

19:29.292 --> 19:31.792
He's up and around,
and trying to go back to work.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.292
Oh, thank God for that.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.125
Can you tell us anything else
about these artifacts?

19:36.208 --> 19:39.542
Well, they're a kind of organic
technology, limited energy.

19:39.625 --> 19:42.625
In order to achieve mobility,
they have to graft themselves

19:42.708 --> 19:44.500
on to another life form.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.292
It's possible that
if they were activated

19:47.375 --> 19:49.250
they tried to assimilate Nelson.

19:49.333 --> 19:53.000
My guess would be that
he's under their control.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.542
For what purpose?

19:55.625 --> 19:56.833
I mean, why would
the artifact choose

19:56.917 --> 19:59.208
to assimilate Nelson,
but not you?

19:59.292 --> 20:00.500
Unknown.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.792
As to what it wants,
that depends on its programming.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.208
Could be anything.

20:04.292 --> 20:06.833
According to Dr. Franklin,
just before it fired

20:06.917 --> 20:08.917
it said something about protect.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.292
Do you think
that might be the key

20:10.375 --> 20:12.750
'to whatever
it was programmed to do?'

20:12.833 --> 20:14.125
Maybe.

20:14.208 --> 20:17.375
But the question is,
protect who?

20:20.208 --> 20:21.458
- And from what?
- 'It..'

20:21.542 --> 20:23.792
Well, that information
maybe contained

20:23.875 --> 20:25.792
in the remaining artifacts.

20:25.875 --> 20:29.292
'If I could assist Dr. Franklin
in decoding them..'

20:29.375 --> 20:31.792
I mean, if I am responsible
for starting all this

20:31.875 --> 20:34.708
the least I can do
is help finish it.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.708
Done.

20:40.708 --> 20:41.708
That's what I told her.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.042
A week on Columbus is simply

20:43.125 --> 20:44.292
not within my budget.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.625
'Of course, then she says..'

20:45.708 --> 20:47.250
[indistinct chattering]

20:49.708 --> 20:50.708
[dramatic music]

20:50.792 --> 20:52.375
Protect.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.625
Lieutenant commander

20:53.708 --> 20:55.458
I picked up
that energy flash again.

20:55.542 --> 20:57.792
Grey 13, level B.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.833
And there's something else.

20:59.917 --> 21:01.667
The energy pattern has changed.

21:01.750 --> 21:05.333
It's 20 percent more powerful
than the last time.

21:05.417 --> 21:07.417
[dramatic music]

21:22.083 --> 21:23.958
[music continues]

21:34.042 --> 21:36.333
(Susan)
'Commander,
I have security in the link.'

21:36.417 --> 21:38.542
Commander, we've got
two fatalities in Grey 13.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.542
It's definitely the same thing
that attacked the doc.

21:40.625 --> 21:42.542
'We're in pursuit now
on Grey 7.'

21:42.625 --> 21:45.000
Alright, I'm moving this
to a level two alert.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.583
Keep this channel open.

21:46.667 --> 21:49.958
Commander, I understand there's
a problem, some kind of attack?

21:50.042 --> 21:52.417
Ms. Cramer,
you are in a secure area.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.250
You will leave,
and you will leave now.

21:54.333 --> 21:57.875
This is news, and the people
have a right to know.

21:57.958 --> 21:59.833
And you have a right to spend
the next two days in the brig.

21:59.917 --> 22:02.208
Lieutenant commander,
I want this weapon triangulated.

22:02.292 --> 22:03.833
Confirmed.

22:03.917 --> 22:05.208
(Sinclair)
'Relay the data to security.'

22:05.292 --> 22:07.708
I want this thing pinned
down to within ten feet.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.292
Coming up now.

22:09.375 --> 22:11.375
Commander..

22:12.750 --> 22:13.667
Don't.

22:13.750 --> 22:14.750
You're too young to experience

22:14.833 --> 22:16.417
that much pain.

22:22.708 --> 22:25.083
[alarm blaring]

22:43.042 --> 22:45.708
[dramatic music]

22:55.667 --> 22:57.208
Commander, we've got him
cornered in Grey 5.

22:57.292 --> 22:58.833
I think we can take him, but
we'll need some lights in here.

22:58.917 --> 23:01.167
He's blacked out the place.

23:01.250 --> 23:03.500
(Susan on wireless)
'Coming on line now.'

23:06.792 --> 23:07.792
Take him down!

23:07.875 --> 23:10.417
[firing]

23:10.500 --> 23:12.250
Protect.

23:13.458 --> 23:14.792
Go!

23:16.208 --> 23:17.917
Go!

23:20.125 --> 23:22.042
Move it!

23:26.583 --> 23:28.750
(Garibaldi)
'Damn!'

23:28.833 --> 23:29.958
We've lost him, commander.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.417
He burned through
into a sub-level

23:31.500 --> 23:33.792
moving between bulkheads.
Could be anywhere.

23:33.875 --> 23:35.458
(Susan on wireless)
'The added shielding
in the bulkhead'

23:35.542 --> 23:37.958
is making it difficult
to pinpoint his location.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.708
We won't know where he is
again until he fires.

23:39.792 --> 23:42.167
Garibaldi, have your team
sweep through each sector

23:42.250 --> 23:45.708
moving inward, two on each team,
five-minute proximity checks.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.458
Confirmed. Security out.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.042
Vance, come here.
I think I've found something.

23:54.208 --> 23:55.500
There.

23:55.583 --> 23:56.833
The organic patterns
in this piece

23:56.917 --> 23:59.500
emulate the synaptic
relays in the brain.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.000
I'm even picking up
cross-genetic equivalents

24:01.083 --> 24:03.667
of serotonin used in the
transfer of information.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.750
- The data storage device?
- Yeah.

24:05.833 --> 24:07.250
If we could pull out
that information

24:07.333 --> 24:09.333
we might get a better idea of
who the Ikarrans were

24:09.417 --> 24:11.667
and more importantly
why they made these things.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.000
Exactly.
Fire up the biosensor.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.500
Let's see if we can tap into it.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.792
[dramatic music]

24:30.125 --> 24:31.667
I've got teams moving
through every section

24:31.750 --> 24:34.167
trying to flush him out,
but he's gone underground.

24:34.250 --> 24:35.375
Could be holed up anywhere.

24:35.458 --> 24:36.667
If he wants to do
the most damage

24:36.750 --> 24:38.042
my guess is he'll head
for the area

24:38.125 --> 24:39.375
with the greatest population.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.542
That makes the central corridor
a prime target.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.042
I've studied
the record of his attacks

24:43.125 --> 24:44.625
and there's a definite
hit-and-run pattern.

24:44.708 --> 24:46.750
Seems like every time
he strikes, it chews up energy

24:46.833 --> 24:48.458
and he has to pull back
and recharge.

24:48.542 --> 24:50.083
There's just a couple
of problems.

24:50.167 --> 24:53.000
One, his periods of latency are
becoming increasingly shorter.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.500
Two, we've been monitoring the
energy level whenever he fires.

24:55.583 --> 24:58.292
Each time, the level
increases by 20 percent.

24:58.375 --> 25:00.167
The last burst was
completely off the scale.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.000
If he continues to build
power at that rate

25:02.083 --> 25:03.708
pretty soon he'll be
strong enough to destroy

25:03.792 --> 25:04.750
the entire station.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.375
So the next chance

25:06.458 --> 25:08.458
we get to stop him

25:08.542 --> 25:10.167
might be our last chance.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.583
Alright, listen up!

25:15.667 --> 25:18.250
I need this whole area cleared.
We'll need room to maneuver.

25:18.333 --> 25:19.917
I want guards on the doors
the second level

25:20.000 --> 25:21.583
and the catwalk.
Come on, come on, come on!

25:21.667 --> 25:23.333
Move it! Move it! Let's go!

25:23.417 --> 25:25.458
(male #1)
'Got it!
Energy readings off the scale.'

25:25.542 --> 25:26.708
- Tracking it.
- Commander!

25:26.792 --> 25:28.375
It's on the move again.
Brown 2, level C.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.250
It's heading for
the central corridor.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.375
Garibaldi, you heard?
It's heading your way.

25:32.458 --> 25:34.125
(Garibaldi on wireless)
'Confirmed.
We'll be ready for it.'

25:35.208 --> 25:36.333
Win, lose or draw

25:36.417 --> 25:38.250
this thing is gonna know
it was in a fight.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.792
Drop the pressure doors
on all sides.

25:39.875 --> 25:41.042
Maybe that'll slow it down.

25:41.125 --> 25:43.083
Give Garibaldi time to get set.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.375
Affirmative.

25:44.458 --> 25:45.917
[growling]

25:53.500 --> 25:54.958
Commander,
we've managed to access

25:55.042 --> 25:56.542
the organic memory banks
of one of the artifacts.

25:56.625 --> 25:58.542
Make it short, doctor.
I don't have a lot of time.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.250
Let me know when it's
on the move again! Go.

26:00.333 --> 26:01.417
Over the course
of their history

26:01.500 --> 26:02.458
the Ikarrans were invaded

26:02.542 --> 26:03.792
half a dozen times

26:03.875 --> 26:05.333
'each assault more deadly
than the first.'

26:05.417 --> 26:07.625
'They needed to create
the perfect weapon'

26:07.708 --> 26:09.125
able to adapt to any situation

26:09.208 --> 26:11.792
an organic weapon capable
of independent thought.

26:11.875 --> 26:14.708
Temperature up 90 degrees
in Brown two, level C.

26:17.833 --> 26:20.333
Since it would take years to
create synthetic intelligence

26:20.417 --> 26:22.000
they incorporated
the brain wave patterns

26:22.083 --> 26:25.000
of one of their researchers
into the weapons.

26:27.750 --> 26:28.833
That's him.

26:28.917 --> 26:30.833
His name was Tular.

26:30.917 --> 26:32.417
But people can be fooled

26:32.500 --> 26:34.000
'so to prevent them
from being confused'

26:34.083 --> 26:36.333
by any misleading instructions
from the enemy

26:36.417 --> 26:38.458
they hardwired the machine,
half of the weapons

26:38.542 --> 26:42.250
not to respond to anyone
who wasn't pure Ikarran.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.542
Just one problem, commander.

26:43.625 --> 26:48.167
How do you define a pure Ikarran
or a pure human?

26:48.250 --> 26:51.125
No one is pure...no one.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.042
Temperature's up 500 degrees.

26:55.125 --> 26:56.667
It'll be through any time now.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.583
Doctor, I'm joining
Mr. Garibaldi on the line.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.500
[dramatic music]

27:08.708 --> 27:10.333
(Sinclair)
'So, who set the parameters
of what it meant'

27:10.417 --> 27:11.792
to be a pure Ikarran?

27:11.875 --> 27:13.208
(Stephen)
Coalition of
religious fanatics

27:13.292 --> 27:16.042
and military extremists
that ran the government.

27:16.125 --> 27:17.667
They programmed the weapons

27:17.750 --> 27:20.250
with a level of standards
based on ideology, not science.

27:20.333 --> 27:22.167
(Sinclair)
Like the Nazi ideal
of a perfect Aryan

27:22.250 --> 27:23.417
during World War II.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.042
(Stephen)
Exactly. The next invasion.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.333
Eleven of the machines
were released and they stopped

27:27.417 --> 27:30.500
the invaders by killing anything
that didn't match their profile

27:30.583 --> 27:32.375
'of the pure,
perfect Ikarran.'

27:32.458 --> 27:34.208
'When they were finished,
the machines turned'

27:34.292 --> 27:35.292
on their creators.

27:35.375 --> 27:37.208
They began a process
of extermination

27:37.292 --> 27:38.708
based on the slightest deviation

27:38.792 --> 27:40.625
of what they were programmed
to consider normal.

27:40.708 --> 27:43.417
They killed and kept killing
until the last Ikarran was dead.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.625
- What about the weapons?
- No one to tend to them.

27:45.708 --> 27:47.583
They were destroyed
by centuries of neglect.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.708
Except for number 12,
which is here now

27:49.792 --> 27:51.583
acting on a program
to protect a world

27:51.667 --> 27:53.750
that's been dead for 1000 years.

27:53.833 --> 27:55.708
(Sinclair)
You said they incorporated
the brain patterns

27:55.792 --> 27:57.792
of one of their researchers
into the weapons.

27:57.875 --> 27:58.917
Tular, yes.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.417
Is there anything there
we can talk to?

28:00.500 --> 28:01.417
Reason with?

28:01.500 --> 28:02.417
Well, there's a complete

28:02.500 --> 28:03.583
personality matrix, yes

28:03.667 --> 28:05.500
but it's totally
subsumed by its program.

28:05.583 --> 28:09.000
Then we'll have to find a way
around the logic of the program.

28:09.083 --> 28:10.458
Better head back
to the med lab, doctor.

28:10.542 --> 28:13.333
I suspect we're going
to need your services.

28:15.875 --> 28:16.958
Weapon!

28:18.833 --> 28:20.083
[dramatic music]

28:40.875 --> 28:42.583
[whispering]
Not yet.

28:42.667 --> 28:44.292
I want it point blank.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.042
Fire.

28:50.667 --> 28:53.000
[guns firing]

29:03.708 --> 29:05.250
Cease fire.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.917
- Damn!
- It's in the next level.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.792
That's a straight line to where
the civilians are quarantined.

29:14.875 --> 29:16.333
How many men do you have
stationed down there?

29:16.417 --> 29:18.458
Not enough. Commander, we hit it
with everything we had.

29:18.542 --> 29:19.833
We didn't even slow it down.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.292
The only weapons that might be
big enough to kill it

29:21.375 --> 29:22.708
would rupture the hull
and kill everybody anyway.

29:22.792 --> 29:24.167
And that's what
we'll have to do.

29:24.250 --> 29:26.167
- Blow out the hull.
- Where are you going?

29:26.250 --> 29:27.958
I'll try to lure it
into the docking area.

29:28.042 --> 29:30.375
We get it in place, seal the
area, and blow out the airlock.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.583
Armored or not,
nothing can live in a vacuum.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.500
Fine, except how're you gonna
get it there?

29:34.583 --> 29:36.833
By going straight
to its personality matrix.

29:36.917 --> 29:38.833
I'm gonna try and make it mad.

29:42.083 --> 29:44.167
Make it mad?
Are you nuts?

29:44.250 --> 29:45.750
Commander!

29:46.875 --> 29:49.542
[intense music]

29:52.042 --> 29:53.125
Tular..

29:54.875 --> 29:57.833
Tular of Ikarra VII..

29:58.583 --> 30:00.208
My name.

30:02.625 --> 30:05.042
My name.

30:05.125 --> 30:07.417
Who knows my name?

30:08.792 --> 30:11.167
Who knows my name?

30:15.125 --> 30:20.125
Your name is dead, Tular.

30:21.292 --> 30:24.500
Your world is dead.

30:24.583 --> 30:26.750
Ikarra lives!

30:26.833 --> 30:28.667
Ikarra must be protected!

30:31.333 --> 30:33.625
You failed.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.625
You failed
in your mission.

30:36.708 --> 30:40.083
'Ikarra is dead..'

30:40.167 --> 30:42.917
...by your own hand.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.708
You, and others like you.

30:45.792 --> 30:47.583
That is a lie!

30:47.667 --> 30:49.750
That is a lie!

30:49.833 --> 30:52.167
(Sinclair)
Ikarra is dead.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.375
[roaring]

31:04.500 --> 31:06.333
[roaring]

31:08.208 --> 31:10.125
[dramatic music]

31:15.125 --> 31:16.917
(Tular)
'Protect!'

31:24.958 --> 31:27.625
Standing by. Ready to initiate
emergency decompression.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.292
Wait! Wait!

31:29.375 --> 31:30.333
[roaring]

31:30.417 --> 31:31.875
[groaning]

31:34.375 --> 31:36.667
- Come on!
- Protect!

31:36.750 --> 31:39.000
Protect who?
From what?

31:39.083 --> 31:40.667
Impure!

31:41.750 --> 31:43.458
Yes. Impure.

31:43.542 --> 31:46.958
You must protect against all
who are not pure Ikarran.

31:47.042 --> 31:48.167
Yes!

31:48.250 --> 31:51.792
And your own people,
how pure were they?

31:51.875 --> 31:54.417
- Pure!
- How pure?

31:54.500 --> 31:56.333
They didn't feed you facts.

31:56.417 --> 31:58.208
They fed you propaganda.

31:58.292 --> 32:01.750
They programmed you with
standards of genetic purity

32:01.833 --> 32:03.500
no one could match!

32:03.583 --> 32:05.833
Not even your own people!

32:05.917 --> 32:07.750
Liar!

32:13.083 --> 32:14.625
[grunting]

32:14.708 --> 32:17.667
Seal the area. Stand by to blow
airlock and depressurize.

32:17.750 --> 32:19.000
Commander,
if we depressurize the area now

32:19.083 --> 32:20.500
you'll be killed with it.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.500
Only one way past that thing.
I'm dead either way.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.792
Dog the hatch.
Seal it. Now!

32:28.292 --> 32:29.708
[whispering]
Stand by.

32:29.792 --> 32:31.417
Ikarra lives!

32:31.500 --> 32:33.750
Ikarra must be protected!

32:35.625 --> 32:36.958
[groaning]

32:39.333 --> 32:42.833
There is no Ikarra,
not the way you remember it.

32:42.917 --> 32:46.542
The others, like you, they beat
the invaders, alright

32:46.625 --> 32:48.542
'just like
they were programmed.'

32:48.625 --> 32:53.250
'They killed anything
that was different...alien'

32:53.333 --> 32:55.750
but we're all aliens
to one another

32:55.833 --> 32:59.167
'flawed, impure...different!'

32:59.250 --> 33:01.042
No!

33:01.125 --> 33:03.167
Too tall! Too short!

33:03.250 --> 33:05.292
Too dark! Too light!

33:05.375 --> 33:08.042
Imperfect. They were killed.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.375
And the killing
went on and on and on.

33:10.458 --> 33:11.708
No!

33:11.792 --> 33:16.708
The man you took over,
Nelson, he's seen Ikarra.

33:16.792 --> 33:20.375
'Ikarra after the others
finished protecting it'

33:20.458 --> 33:24.875
cleansing it of every slightest
variation in genetics.

33:24.958 --> 33:27.500
You can access his memories.

33:28.542 --> 33:30.500
'See for yourself.'

33:31.667 --> 33:33.583
'Look inside his mind.'

33:34.792 --> 33:37.292
'See what he's seen.'

33:40.333 --> 33:42.000
Go on.

33:42.083 --> 33:44.375
Look into his mind.

33:44.458 --> 33:47.333
He can't hide the truth.
He can't lie to you.

33:48.917 --> 33:50.875
'Look deep.'

33:50.958 --> 33:52.458
'Look at it.'

33:54.250 --> 33:55.375
A desert.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.375
'Yes.'

34:00.875 --> 34:02.375
Dead.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.667
A thousand years...dead.

34:07.542 --> 34:09.750
There's your pure world..

34:09.833 --> 34:11.792
...your perfect world.

34:15.708 --> 34:18.667
- We did this?
- 'Yes.'

34:18.750 --> 34:19.792
No!

34:19.875 --> 34:22.375
'Damn you. Look at it.'

34:23.208 --> 34:25.208
You and the rest..

34:25.292 --> 34:27.500
...you forgot the first rule
of the fanatic.

34:27.583 --> 34:29.375
When you become obsessed
with the enemy

34:29.458 --> 34:31.833
you become the enemy.

34:33.750 --> 34:37.542
Ikarra!

34:42.792 --> 34:46.333
Great Maker..

34:48.583 --> 34:51.292
...forgive us.

34:51.375 --> 34:54.250
This...madness!

34:58.375 --> 35:01.083
Forgive us.

35:09.167 --> 35:11.833
[screaming]

35:34.500 --> 35:36.667
[instrumental music]

35:40.583 --> 35:42.542
Stephen, how's Nelson?

35:42.625 --> 35:45.542
- Med lab 2, resting.
- Good.

35:45.625 --> 35:47.208
Vance!

35:47.292 --> 35:50.333
I found this
in Nelson's effects.

35:50.417 --> 35:52.708
It's meant for
cardial stimulation.

35:52.792 --> 35:54.083
If used
on a healthy person

35:54.167 --> 35:57.875
it could cause
cardiac infarction or death.

35:57.958 --> 36:02.042
The body of the customs guard
had two tiny marks on the back

36:02.125 --> 36:03.500
so small we missed them at first

36:03.583 --> 36:07.042
but they do match
the prongs there.

36:07.125 --> 36:09.292
'I spoke to Nelson.'

36:09.375 --> 36:12.792
He confirms things
I'd hoped I was wrong about.

36:12.875 --> 36:16.500
You knew he did not put those
artifacts through quarantine.

36:16.583 --> 36:19.833
He was acting on your orders
the whole time.

36:21.583 --> 36:24.625
For God's sake, Vance, why?

36:26.042 --> 36:29.125
[sighs]
Interplanetary Expeditions

36:29.208 --> 36:31.875
the corporation that financed
the dig on Ikarra VII

36:31.958 --> 36:33.208
is a front..

36:33.292 --> 36:37.375
...a front for a
bio-weapons supplier.

36:37.458 --> 36:39.875
Oh, I could just have turned
over the artifacts

36:39.958 --> 36:41.917
taken the standard
commission

36:42.000 --> 36:45.083
but if they were
what I suspected..

36:45.167 --> 36:46.667
...organic weapons..

36:46.750 --> 36:47.958
...then I could take a chance

36:48.042 --> 36:49.500
hold back on delivery,
and they'd--

36:49.583 --> 36:51.083
Pay millions.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.875
Or more.

36:52.958 --> 36:55.083
More money
than you can conceive.

36:55.167 --> 36:57.417
But before you could take
that chance, you had to be sure

36:57.500 --> 36:59.125
and that's why
you brought them here.

36:59.208 --> 37:00.792
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.250
You deliberately endangered

37:02.333 --> 37:04.125
a quarter-million
humans and aliens

37:04.208 --> 37:06.167
just to raise
your profit margin.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.625
Oh, I was sure
I could control it.

37:07.708 --> 37:09.958
I never expected anybody
to get hurt.

37:10.042 --> 37:12.000
What about
the murdered customs guard?

37:12.083 --> 37:14.375
Well, we had to get them
through customs.

37:14.458 --> 37:16.042
Nelson said he'd do it.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.125
I didn't know how.
I didn't ask.

37:18.208 --> 37:20.375
There was too much at stake.

37:20.458 --> 37:23.708
That's why the weapon bonded
to him, and not to one of us.

37:23.792 --> 37:25.958
The program needed
someone willing to kill.

37:26.042 --> 37:28.792
Look, Stephen,
we can work all this out.

37:28.875 --> 37:30.625
We can sell the rest
of the artifacts

37:30.708 --> 37:32.375
to Interplanetary Expeditions.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.167
They have enough muscle
to clean up this whole mess.

37:35.250 --> 37:38.542
All you have to do is, uh..

37:39.417 --> 37:42.167
...not turn me in.

37:42.250 --> 37:44.750
I mean, just think
what you could do

37:44.833 --> 37:47.250
with all that money.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.250
[doors open]

37:58.333 --> 38:00.583
It's too late.

38:08.417 --> 38:10.542
Stephen..

38:21.792 --> 38:23.792
[chuckles]

38:27.333 --> 38:29.500
[doorbell ringing]

38:31.000 --> 38:33.167
Come.

38:38.042 --> 38:40.917
You've looked better.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.208
[sighs]
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second?

38:43.292 --> 38:44.667
Sure.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.542
The whole station's talking
about how you were willing

38:46.625 --> 38:48.167
to risk your life
to stop that thing.

38:48.250 --> 38:50.250
- I didn't risk--
- 'Let me finish.'

38:50.333 --> 38:51.792
This is the third time
in the last year

38:51.875 --> 38:54.375
you've put yourself
on the line like this.

38:54.458 --> 38:57.167
I didn't know
anyone was counting.

38:57.250 --> 38:58.750
'Jeff..'

38:59.500 --> 39:01.750
...you're my friend.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.417
You've been my friend
a lot longer

39:04.500 --> 39:05.917
than you've been
my commanding officer

39:06.000 --> 39:09.333
so I think
I'm entitled to say this.

39:09.417 --> 39:12.167
We were both in Earthforce
during the war.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.667
I wasn't on the line, but..

39:14.750 --> 39:17.667
...I did my share.

39:17.750 --> 39:21.458
I know a lot of guys who came
out of the war changed.

39:21.542 --> 39:24.875
Some came out better.
Some came out worse.

39:26.792 --> 39:28.917
A lot of them
have this problem.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.750
The war gave them definition,
direction, purpose.

39:32.833 --> 39:34.583
Without it, they don't know
how to fit in anymore

39:34.667 --> 39:37.583
so they keep looking for ways
to go out in a blaze of glory.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.708
Some people call that
being a hero, maybe so.

39:40.792 --> 39:44.292
I don't know.
I've never been one.

39:46.208 --> 39:50.208
Me...I think they're looking
for something worth dying for

39:50.292 --> 39:53.958
because it's easier than finding
something worth living for.

39:57.583 --> 39:58.750
Finished?

40:01.375 --> 40:02.542
Yeah.

40:03.917 --> 40:05.292
I guess that covers it.

40:09.208 --> 40:11.125
'Michael..'

40:13.375 --> 40:15.917
...I don't have
an answer for you..

40:17.542 --> 40:19.250
..and..

40:20.917 --> 40:23.208
...I think maybe I should.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.917
Thanks.

40:30.417 --> 40:32.333
[instrumental music]

40:42.083 --> 40:43.833
There you go, sir.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.833
You seem troubled, doctor.

40:48.917 --> 40:50.792
No. I'm just thinking.

40:52.458 --> 40:54.333
You know, the Ikarran
fought against invaders

40:54.417 --> 40:57.000
just like we fought
against the Minbari.

40:57.083 --> 40:59.667
They became obsessed with it.

40:59.750 --> 41:03.042
Back home, there is a growing
pro-Earth movement

41:03.125 --> 41:06.250
rumors of hate groups
targeting aliens.

41:06.333 --> 41:09.375
And on all sides,
the fanatics

41:09.458 --> 41:11.625
who think that society
has to be protected

41:11.708 --> 41:13.375
against anyone
who's different.

41:14.833 --> 41:17.208
I'm starting to wonder
if what we just saw

41:17.292 --> 41:19.625
is a preview of things to come.

41:19.708 --> 41:23.167
No. I can't believe
we'd be that foolish.

41:23.250 --> 41:26.042
Santayana, "Those who do not
remember the past

41:26.125 --> 41:28.125
are condemned to repeat it."

41:28.208 --> 41:29.500
[clears throat]

41:29.583 --> 41:31.167
- Yes?
- Dr. Franklin.

41:31.250 --> 41:32.625
I have orders
to confiscate the artifacts

41:32.708 --> 41:34.042
and transfer them
to Earth Central.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.375
On whose authority?

41:35.458 --> 41:37.500
Earth Force Defense,
bio-weapons division.

41:37.583 --> 41:40.500
Something about studying them
for planetary security reasons.

41:41.917 --> 41:44.583
It would seem no one
reads Santayana anymore.

41:44.667 --> 41:46.625
You'll excuse me, if you need
me, I'll be over there

41:46.708 --> 41:49.167
getting drunk
with the rest of the aliens.

41:56.667 --> 42:00.875
(Mary Ann)
'So, commander, after all
you've just gone through'

42:00.958 --> 42:02.417
I have to ask you
the same question

42:02.500 --> 42:04.083
a lot of people
back home are asking

42:04.167 --> 42:06.542
about space these days.

42:06.625 --> 42:08.417
Is it worth it?

42:08.500 --> 42:10.208
Should we just pull back

42:10.292 --> 42:12.708
forget the whole thing
as a bad idea

42:12.792 --> 42:15.250
and take care of our
own problems at home?

42:15.333 --> 42:19.042
No. We have to stay here.

42:19.125 --> 42:21.000
And there's a simple reason why.

42:21.083 --> 42:24.042
Ask ten different scientists
about the environment

42:24.125 --> 42:26.667
population control, genetics

42:26.750 --> 42:28.542
and you'll get
ten different answers

42:28.625 --> 42:31.125
but there's one thing every
scientist on the planet

42:31.208 --> 42:32.917
agrees on.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.958
Whether it happens in a hundred
years or a thousand years

42:36.042 --> 42:39.875
or a million years, eventually
our sun will grow cold

42:39.958 --> 42:41.625
and go out.

42:41.708 --> 42:45.000
When that happens,
it won't just take us.

42:46.667 --> 42:48.792
It'll take
Marilyn Monroe..

42:48.875 --> 42:53.958
...and Lao-Tzu, and Einstein,
and Morabuto, and..

42:54.042 --> 42:57.625
Buddy Holly,
and Aristophanes, and..

42:57.708 --> 42:59.833
All of this..

42:59.917 --> 43:04.458
All of this...was for nothing..

43:04.542 --> 43:06.625
'...unless we go to the stars.'

43:12.083 --> 43:13.833
[theme music]
