AREN'T TOGETHER
ANYMORE,

00:28.300 --> 00:31.100

IT WOULD BE SAFER
IF I HAD A BUFFER.

IS NOW HAVING SEVERE
RAMIFICATIONS ON ME.

00:35.900 --> 00:40.400
OOH, RAMIFICATIONS.
NICE WORD, JUGHEAD.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.500
YOU SEE, NOW FEENY KNOWS
I'M IN THE CLASS.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.600
IT'S JUST LOGISTICS, SHAWN.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.000
LISTEN, IF I SIT
IN THAT SEAT,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.967

SMELL HER HAIR,
HEAR HER BREATHE,

00:48.967 --> 00:51.767

00:51.767 --> 00:55.200
OH, OK,
I'LL SIT HERE.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.367
BUT I'M ONLY BETWEEN
YOU TWO, OK?

00:57.367 --> 00:59.500
I'M NOT IN
THE MIDDLE OF YOU.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.100
HEY, TOPANGA,
CAN I BORROW
YOUR BIG PENCIL?

01:02.100 --> 01:03.834
THEY'RE NOT
DIVORCED, KENNY.

01:03.834 --> 01:05.367
IT'S JUST A TRIAL
SEPARATION.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.900

A PENCIL MEANS, OK?

01:07.900 --> 01:11.867

BORROWED MORE PENCILS
THAN SHAWN HUNTER.

01:11.867 --> 01:15.100
HEY, THANKS FOR NOT GETTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.400
HE WAS JUST ASKING
FOR A PENCIL.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.133
I KNOW WHAT
HE WAS ASKING FOR.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.400
AND IF HE ASKS AGAIN,

01:20.400 --> 01:22.100
I'LL STAB
THAT BIG PENCIL
THROUGH HIS HEART.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.800

01:24.800 --> 01:27.200
WHY IS SHAWN SO
OBSESSED WITH YOU, TOO?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.967

01:37.033 --> 01:40.600
MR. FEENY, I'M SURE
IF YOU RECALL THE PAIN

01:40.600 --> 01:42.734
OF BEING STABBED IN THE BACK
BY A GIRLFRIEND.

01:42.734 --> 01:44.700
I DIDN'T STAB HIM.
HE STABBED ME.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.300
OH, I'D STAB MYSELF
BEFORE I'D STAB YOU.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.500
KENNY, GIVE ME
THAT PENCIL!

01:48.500 --> 01:49.567
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.600

01:51.600 --> 01:53.834

WHATEVER THE HELL
I'M TEACHING.

02:01.033 --> 02:04.233
MATTHEWS, GO SIT
ON THAT SIDE
OF THE ROOM.

02:04.233 --> 02:06.200
LAWRENCE, YOU SIT
ON THIS SIDE.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.400
RIGHT NOW, LET'S GO!

02:07.400 --> 02:08.967
MR. FEENY,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

02:08.967 --> 02:11.400
YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING
TO THE FURTHERANCE
OF THEIR APARTNESS.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.500

A CLASS HERE.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.000
NOW, MR. HUNTER,

02:16.000 --> 02:17.900
DON'T TRY AND
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.000
QUIET!

02:20.000 --> 02:22.100

INTERRUPTION

02:22.100 --> 02:24.600

GOING INTO DETENTION.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.667
OH, THAT'S IT.

02:41.667 --> 02:45.300

THINK SENIORS
STILL GOT DETENTION.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.967
THEY DO WHEN THEY ACT
LIKE 2-YEAR-OLDS.

02:48.967 --> 02:52.500
[MOCKING]
THEY DO WHEN THEY ACT
LIKE 2-YEAR-OLDS.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.800
MR. MATTHEWS, WHEN
ONE MOCKS SOMEONE,

02:55.800 --> 02:59.400
ONE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING
RIGHT AT THEM.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.500
I'M NOT IN
MY REGULAR SEAT.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.700
THIS IS DETENTION,
PEOPLE. THAT MEANS
NO TALKING, MOVING,

03:05.700 --> 03:09.200
OR FRATERNIZING FOR THE
NEXT HOUR-AND-A-HALF.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
MR. FEENY?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I AM NOT IN DETENTION,
MR. HUNTER.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I CAN DO AS I PLEASE.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
AND DON'T
FOR A MOMENT THINK

03:15.000 --> 03:17.500
BECAUSE OF MY ABSENCE
FROM THIS ROOM

03:17.500 --> 03:19.500
THAT YOU'RE
NOT BEING WATCHED.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.367
ALL I WANTED
WAS A PENCIL.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.967
OH, SHUT UP, KENNY.

03:29.967 --> 03:31.500
YOU'RE LUCKY
TO EVEN BE HERE.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.500
I DON'T HAPPEN
TO SEE IT THAT WAY.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.100
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

03:37.100 --> 03:38.567
WELL, IF WE'RE
GOING TO BE IN HERE
FOR OVER AN HOUR,

03:38.567 --> 03:41.300
THEN I'M GOING TO MY LOCKER
TO GET MY CHEESE PRODUCT.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.767
HUH, CAN YOU
BELIEVE THIS?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.233
FEENY LOCKED US IN.

03:47.233 --> 03:48.500
HE CAN'T DO THAT!

03:48.500 --> 03:51.800
IT'S AGAINST THE
GENEVA DETENTION
CONVENTION.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.300

04:03.233 --> 04:04.600
YIGH!

04:04.600 --> 04:08.000
DO YOU THINK HE
WORKS ON THAT LOOK?

04:08.000 --> 04:12.567
HEY, GIGGLES,
WE'RE LOCKED IN.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.800
DO YOU HAVE THE KEY?

04:16.734 --> 04:18.100
Cory: GREAT!

04:18.100 --> 04:19.734
YOU WANNA LET US OUT?

04:23.600 --> 04:25.400
HEY, THIS IS
GETTING SCARY.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.367
WHAT IS GOING ON?

04:27.367 --> 04:30.600
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I LIKE IT.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.934
AAH!

04:36.367 --> 04:38.500

LIKE IT AS MUCH.

I DON'T THINK IT'S 'CAUSE
HE RAN OUT OF CHALK.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.300
NO, IT'S FAKE.
IT'S ALL FAKE.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.367
FEENY'S PULLING
SOME ELABORATE HOAX.

05:00.367 --> 05:01.367
WHY?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.000
WELL, WHY DOES FEENY
DO ANYTHING?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.100
TO TEACH US
SOMETHING.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.600
WHAT'S HE TRYING
TO TEACH US?

05:05.600 --> 05:07.600
TO PAY ATTENTION
OR WE DIE.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.767
OH, YOU'RE NUTS.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.000
STOP ATTACKING ME, OK.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.667
YOU'VE GIVEN UP YOUR
RIGHT TO ATTACK ME.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.600
THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.834
IT DOES IF YOU'VE SEEN
AS MANY HORROR FILMS
AS I HAVE.

05:16.834 --> 05:18.233
THIS IS CLASSIC--

05:18.233 --> 05:21.100
THE LOCKED DOOR,
THE SCARY JANITOR,

05:21.100 --> 05:26.500
THE BLOODY WARNING,
AND OUR SOON-TO-BE
FIRST VICTIM.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.133
ME? WHY ME?

05:29.133 --> 05:31.300
WELL, KENNY, IT'S
CERTAINLY NOT GOING
TO BE ANY OF US.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.300

OUR BEATING HEARTS.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.133

OUR HEIGHTENED FEAR.

05:47.133 --> 05:48.734
AND THE FACT THAT
SOMETHING HORRIBLE

05:48.734 --> 05:53.200
IS ABOUT TO WALK
IN THAT DOOR RIGHT NOW!

05:53.200 --> 05:55.200

05:57.600 --> 05:59.100
OH, WHO BLED
ON THE BLACKBOARD?

05:59.100 --> 06:00.400
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

06:00.400 --> 06:02.667
OH, WELL, JACK AND I
HAD THE HANKERING
FOR SOME HOOPS.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.767

THE OLD JOHN ADAMS'
LOCKER ROOM, YOU KNOW.

06:05.767 --> 06:07.300
HEY, DID YOU GUYS
SEE FEENY OUT THERE?

06:07.300 --> 06:09.033
NOPE. NOT A SOUL.

06:09.033 --> 06:10.100
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
KIND OF CREEPY.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.133
WHY CREEPY?
WHY'S IT CREEPY?

06:11.133 --> 06:12.467
WHY'D YOU SAY CREEPY?
WHY CREEPY?

06:12.467 --> 06:15.100
UH, I THINK IT HAD
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THAT JANITOR.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.734
I KNEW IT!

06:16.734 --> 06:18.200
SEE, WE WERE
FINISHED PLAYING.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.600
WENT INTO THE LOCKER
ROOM TO CHANGE

06:19.600 --> 06:21.000
AND THERE HE
WAS PUSHING
HIS SQUEAKY BIN,

06:21.000 --> 06:22.967
EMPTYING
THE WASTEBASKETS.

06:22.967 --> 06:24.200
WELL, THAT'S
NOT SO CREEPY.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.800
OH, AND THERE
WAS BLOOD COMING
OUT OF THE SHOWERS.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
OH!

06:26.800 --> 06:27.800

THE PRESSURE?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.467

OUT OF MY HAIR...

06:30.667 --> 06:32.400

06:32.400 --> 06:36.600
THIS IS STRAIGHT OUT
OF THAT HORROR FILM CLASSIC

06:36.600 --> 06:38.667

THAT KENNY HAS TO BE
THE FIRST TO DIE.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.700
I REALLY WISH YOU'D
STOP SAYING THAT.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.233
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
FEENY'S TRYING TO DO?

06:54.233 --> 06:57.400
I THINK THAT HE KNOWS
WE'RE TOO OLD FOR
DETENTION TO SCARE US

06:57.400 --> 06:59.000
LIKE IT DID WHEN WE
WERE LITTLE KIDS, RIGHT?

06:59.000 --> 07:03.934
