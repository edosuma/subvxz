00:27.500 --> 00:28.416
[blades clank]

00:28.500 --> 00:29.500
[Abbot] Wait.

00:38.666 --> 00:41.208
Do you understand what you are, devil?

00:42.416 --> 00:44.291
You were created to obey.

00:45.125 --> 00:46.416
To obey me.

00:47.958 --> 00:50.083
And that is all you were created for.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.375
Mm-hmm?

00:54.208 --> 00:55.208
Was it the witch?

00:56.416 --> 00:58.750
Does her magic give her power over you?

01:00.125 --> 01:03.875
Or was there some error
in how you were made?

01:06.291 --> 01:08.333
[ominous music continues to play]

01:10.083 --> 01:11.708
This is what you are.

01:11.791 --> 01:13.666
-[gasps]
-[Abbot] Do you understand?

01:13.750 --> 01:14.666
[Edouard gasps]

01:15.166 --> 01:18.083
[Abbot] You exist only for me.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.625
[eerie music rising]

01:21.416 --> 01:23.416
[dramatic opening theme music plays]

[music fades]

01:32.750 --> 01:33.875
[birds chirping]

01:37.750 --> 01:41.708
If this Forgemaster is in the Abbey,
the Abbot must be his prisoner.

01:41.791 --> 01:43.750
Or the Abbot invited him in.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.000
That's impossible. He's a good man.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.208
When I first came to Machecoul,
it was the Abbot who helped me.

01:50.291 --> 01:53.208
Though when you think about it,
the Church in alliance with evil,

01:53.291 --> 01:55.500
we were stupid not to think of it before.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.333
But vampires, Maria?

01:57.416 --> 02:00.666
[Maria] If you look at the history
of the Church, it'd be hardly surprising.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.041
Well, maybe a bit surprising.

02:03.125 --> 02:05.000
[faint ethereal music playing]

02:05.083 --> 02:06.250
[Richter] Are you all right?

02:08.708 --> 02:10.291
You can't be sure that was him.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.000
When someone dies, someone you love,

02:15.500 --> 02:18.000
for a long time,
you think you see them everywhere.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.041
They were his eyes.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.458
I don't know anything
about night creatures,

02:24.375 --> 02:26.000
but I don't think you do either.

02:26.958 --> 02:30.250
I know it's awful to think your friend
was turned into one of them, but--

02:30.333 --> 02:32.375
I abandoned him, and they killed him.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.375
I cannot abandon him now.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.083
So, what do you want to do? Rescue him?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.041
Even if it is Edouard,

02:39.125 --> 02:41.333
maybe he doesn't want
to be rescued, Annette.

02:42.041 --> 02:43.291
Or maybe he can't be.

02:45.875 --> 02:49.166
Maybe the only way to save him
would be to kill him.

02:50.333 --> 02:52.791
And face it, he's already dead.

02:56.416 --> 02:58.583
If the Abbot
is the Forgemaster's prisoner,

02:59.208 --> 03:00.750
can you abandon him?

03:00.833 --> 03:05.041
We can't just charge into the Abbey hoping
to defeat a fucking powerful sorcerer

03:05.125 --> 03:07.000
and liberate all our friends.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.208
I don't want a repeat
of what happened at the château.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.291
So you're afraid.

03:10.375 --> 03:14.041
I'm not afraid. I'm saying we need a plan.

03:14.125 --> 03:15.208
We have magic.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.666
-Or three of us do.
-[gasps]

03:17.750 --> 03:21.750
If I can't save Edouard, yes,
I will kill him. It would be a mercy.

03:21.833 --> 03:25.458
Oh, just walk in and kill him.
That sounds foolproof.

03:25.541 --> 03:27.166
The Abbey's made of stone.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.791
I can bury them in their own church,
bring it crashing down around their heads.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.500
How will that help the Abbot?

03:32.583 --> 03:35.166
If he's in league with the bastards,
which he probably is,

03:35.250 --> 03:36.458
we don't want to help him.

03:36.541 --> 03:39.000
Yeah, but we don't know yet
one way or the other.

03:39.791 --> 03:41.791
[sighs]

03:43.375 --> 03:45.666
We need a plan.

03:45.750 --> 03:50.125
And since I'm not much good at plans,
it would be really fucking useful

03:50.208 --> 03:52.166
if you would all start thinking of one.

03:52.250 --> 03:55.458
A proper plan, not "walk in,
make a few snap decisions about

03:55.541 --> 03:58.166
who deserves to live or die,
and then turn everything to rubble."

03:58.250 --> 04:00.125
[sad, tense music playing]

04:00.208 --> 04:02.041
We're all afraid, Richter.

04:02.958 --> 04:03.958
Of course we are.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.500
I've only been afraid once in all my life,

04:08.083 --> 04:09.125
and I was 10.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.083
You know what it's like
to watch your mother die, you said.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.166
She was killed by a vampire, wasn't she?

04:17.375 --> 04:18.541
She was a Belmont.

04:19.166 --> 04:22.541
-[Annette] I know it haunts your dreams.
-She was doing her duty.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.875
Usually, everyone says I'm too rash.

04:24.958 --> 04:28.375
The moment I say we need a plan,
everyone starts calling me a coward.

04:28.458 --> 04:30.500
[Maria] No one's calling you
a coward, Richter.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.083
[Annette] You're not cowards.

04:32.166 --> 04:35.208
You're just children
with no experience of the world.

04:35.291 --> 04:38.708
No experience of the hard choices
adults have to make.

04:39.375 --> 04:40.875
[Tera] There's another way in.

04:41.958 --> 04:45.500
There's a secret underground passageway
into the Abbey.

04:45.583 --> 04:46.875
How do you know that?

04:47.375 --> 04:49.375
We need to know the truth, don't we?

04:49.875 --> 04:51.375
What is what, who is who.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.333
If we have friends left or only enemies.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.416
This time, I'm coming with you.

05:01.291 --> 05:02.250
[music fades]

05:02.333 --> 05:04.333
[church bell tolling in distance]

05:16.416 --> 05:20.208
The Messiah knows, I presume,
that your Abbot is a Forgemaster.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.541
Of course she knows.

05:22.625 --> 05:26.458
She wouldn't be very interested in him
if he was just an abbot.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.583
So, she knows he means to betray her.

05:30.291 --> 05:34.125
He thinks the devils he manufactures
will be enough to destroy her

05:34.208 --> 05:35.416
when the time comes.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.166
What do you think?
Do you think he's right?

05:39.750 --> 05:41.875
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:41.958 --> 05:44.166
This alliance can't last.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.958
The moment you've crushed your enemies,
she'll turn on you.

05:47.583 --> 05:50.625
The gamble is
you wage war and you prevail.

05:53.708 --> 05:55.625
Are you sure this path is right?

05:57.125 --> 05:59.375
There's evil everywhere we look.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.500
So we use our heads.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.333
Or lose them.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.458
Your concern is very touching.

06:09.541 --> 06:12.708
So he bribed some demon
to give him this power,

06:12.791 --> 06:15.875
build him a machine, promise him victory.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.250
What was the cost?

06:17.833 --> 06:19.791
You already know the cost.

06:19.875 --> 06:24.125
And who pays it? Just him or all of you?

06:24.625 --> 06:25.833
Will you?

06:26.416 --> 06:27.458
Which demon?

06:28.708 --> 06:31.916
Which demon will claim his price
when all this is done?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.333
Does it matter?

06:33.416 --> 06:34.291
Of course.

06:34.958 --> 06:38.833
There are petty demon princelings
you can haggle with and cheat.

06:38.916 --> 06:43.333
There are demon charlatans
whose faces you can laugh in, spit in.

06:44.500 --> 06:48.666
There are demons who once were gods…
and those who still are.

06:49.166 --> 06:50.416
There's only one God.

06:51.125 --> 06:51.958
Just one.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.791
That's the only thing I'm sure of.

06:55.291 --> 06:58.416
And I've spent my whole life serving him,

06:58.500 --> 06:59.458
fighting for him.

07:00.541 --> 07:02.250
That hasn't changed,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.291
and it never will.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.375
[ominous music playing]

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
[church bell tolling in distance]

07:35.250 --> 07:37.250
[ominous music intensifies]

07:50.291 --> 07:51.250
One God.

07:52.208 --> 07:53.041
[scoffs]

07:53.916 --> 07:55.875
And you think he can protect you?

08:02.875 --> 08:03.875
[music fades]

08:04.833 --> 08:07.000
[indistinct conversations in distance]

08:08.083 --> 08:10.083
[mysterious music playing]

08:11.750 --> 08:12.708
[mechanism whirs]

08:12.791 --> 08:14.000
[loud thudding]

08:14.083 --> 08:16.083
[mechanism clicking]

08:21.583 --> 08:25.333
This was made long before the Abbot
and his monks came from Malta.

08:25.416 --> 08:28.791
You just happened to stumble upon it
one day while you're out picking flowers?

08:28.875 --> 08:30.291
[whooshes]

08:30.375 --> 08:32.000
It leads into the cellars.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.833
[mysterious music continues]

08:42.625 --> 08:43.708
[door opens]

08:53.041 --> 08:54.458
[Marquis] Father Abbot.

08:55.041 --> 08:58.291
May I introduce Emissary Drolta Tzuentes.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.541
You were praying, how sweet.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.375
And what a pretty church.

09:07.458 --> 09:10.916
[Abbot] I imagine you don't see
a lot of churches.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.208
[chuckling] Oh, it takes more
than the house of God

09:13.291 --> 09:14.708
to cause me to combust,

09:14.791 --> 09:16.208
if that's what you mean.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.375
Sunlight though, I see.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.000
For now.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.791
He must have searched so deep in his soul,

09:24.875 --> 09:28.958
prayed so hard,
before he was sure… of this,

09:29.041 --> 09:30.833
of his need for us.

09:30.916 --> 09:33.166
Of its inevitability.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.125
And, of course, I understand.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.250
I'm not a fool.

09:37.958 --> 09:40.208
It must be stuck in your craw
like a chicken bone…

09:40.291 --> 09:42.041
-[sizzling]
-…threatening to choke you.

09:42.125 --> 09:45.666
I haven't choked yet,
and nor has your mistress.

09:45.750 --> 09:50.333
Though, in her case, it wouldn't be
so much a chicken bone as a what?

09:50.416 --> 09:53.208
Hmm, the ribs of some infants?

09:53.291 --> 09:55.458
My mistress, the Messiah.

09:56.125 --> 09:59.250
Your soul must scream
in outrage at the very thought.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.125
My soul is at peace.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.166
Which yours will never be.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.041
I like him. He's feisty.

10:08.583 --> 10:13.041
The survival of his world in the balance,
but he's not afraid to insult me.

10:13.833 --> 10:17.791
Or he can't control
his temper or his pride,

10:17.875 --> 10:19.458
or he's a fucking moron.

10:19.958 --> 10:22.333
It wasn't our intention to insult you.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.291
[laughs]

10:25.375 --> 10:28.083
Oh. Did you think we were flirting?

10:28.916 --> 10:32.625
I know it's all about sex
with you priests, but, believe me,

10:32.708 --> 10:35.083
you really shouldn't tempt me
on that score.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.833
You wouldn't like it.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.125
Every orifice I possess has teeth.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.875
We don't have to pretend
to like each other.

10:42.958 --> 10:44.958
This is an arrangement
convenient to us both

10:45.041 --> 10:46.666
because we share a common enemy.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.333
The people.

10:48.416 --> 10:50.958
We prefer to say the Godless mob.

10:51.041 --> 10:55.750
The barbarians who tear our church up
from its foundations, brick by brick,

10:55.833 --> 10:57.125
and burn what's left.

10:57.208 --> 11:00.541
And throw you and your mistress
on the flames.

11:00.625 --> 11:01.958
Along with us.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.458
So, welcome,

11:05.541 --> 11:08.583
Emissary Tzuentes, to Machecoul.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.166
[squeaking]

11:15.166 --> 11:17.000
You can smell the evil down here.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.500
Do you really think you could kill him?

11:21.750 --> 11:23.041
He's someone you love.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.291
Even if he's become a monster.

11:27.666 --> 11:29.250
He could never be a monster.

11:30.666 --> 11:31.791
So what will you do?

11:35.708 --> 11:37.666
So, night creatures.

11:38.375 --> 11:42.041
The Marquis has helpfully provided you
with sundry corpses.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.583
You must have a fair few by now.

11:44.666 --> 11:47.666
Eighteen in total. There will be more.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.875
My mistress expects a lot more.
How long will it take to make them?

11:51.958 --> 11:54.666
I will honor my side of the agreement,

11:54.750 --> 11:56.916
as will you, I trust.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.416
Our people are expecting Joan of Arc.
Someone they can believe in.

12:01.500 --> 12:04.916
Oh, yes, that's a delicious touch.

12:05.541 --> 12:09.208
The holy warrior queen, we love that.

12:09.708 --> 12:12.458
I assure you,
my mistress won't disappoint.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.750
[Drolta and Marquis chuckling]

12:14.833 --> 12:17.750
I'd love to meet some. Night creatures.

12:18.291 --> 12:20.583
Have a little tour of the workshop.

12:20.666 --> 12:21.625
Where is it?

12:22.125 --> 12:25.166
You, handsome, feisty, glowering one,

12:25.250 --> 12:26.833
show me the demon machine.

12:26.916 --> 12:28.250
Please tell me it's downstairs,

12:28.333 --> 12:30.583
because all this sunlight
is giving me a headache.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.375
[ominous music playing]

12:38.041 --> 12:39.541
[sighs]

12:50.958 --> 12:52.958
[music continues to play]

12:55.625 --> 12:57.041
[snarls]

13:06.291 --> 13:07.791
[chains clanking]

13:17.416 --> 13:19.833
What extraordinary thing happened here?

13:21.166 --> 13:22.708
What crime did you commit?

13:23.541 --> 13:27.916
I smell pain, regret, despair.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.583
A human soul.

13:32.375 --> 13:36.083
I don't know what happened,

13:37.250 --> 13:38.083
who I am,

13:38.708 --> 13:41.041
what-- what I am,

13:42.875 --> 13:44.416
but I want my freedom.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.416
[chuckles]

13:48.166 --> 13:49.375
Don't we all?

13:57.625 --> 13:58.458
[stone rasps]

14:01.625 --> 14:03.250
[Tera] We're here for the truth.

But we all know
there'll be night creatures,

14:09.375 --> 14:10.833

The kingdom of God itself is under threat.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.500
I have to protect it.
