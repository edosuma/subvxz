Good morning,

01:14.542 --> 01:16.777
Are you looking for some...

01:16.810 --> 01:18.779
Dana, close the window.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.481
It's freezing.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.184
But Sara,

01:23.217 --> 01:25.586
there's a Kentrosaurus
outside our window!

01:25.619 --> 01:27.621
I don't care-asaurus.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.257
It's the weekend.

I don't believe it!

01:42.503 --> 01:43.871
Dana, go back to--

01:43.904 --> 01:45.439
What...

01:46.874 --> 01:48.609
What are you doing?

01:48.642 --> 01:51.379

I'm not still asleep.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.217
Sara, I'm going to
tell you something

even though it might
blow your mind.

01:58.252 --> 02:01.489
- Are you ready?
- Why can't I go back to sleep?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.624
You know how my mom
met your dad,

02:03.657 --> 02:06.394
and now we're a family,
even though we look different?

02:06.427 --> 02:08.162
Yes, I was there.

02:08.196 --> 02:11.165
Well, dinosaurs
have the same thing.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.301
Some dinosaurs look
a little bit different,

02:13.334 --> 02:16.604
like how many spikes they have,
but belong to the same family.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.906
Wow...

02:18.939 --> 02:20.474
Mind blown.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.745
Well, try this then.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.347
Right now...

02:26.380 --> 02:27.881
right out there,

02:27.915 --> 02:29.450
there's a kentrosaurus

02:29.483 --> 02:30.884
AND a stegosaurus!

02:32.620 --> 02:35.356
They're both from
the Stegosauridae Family.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.827
Dana, you should
go investigate.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.296
- Do you wanna come?
- No.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.831

Dino investigation.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.977

Yep, definitely more a

This is not...

03:27.375 --> 03:29.243

Oh no!

03:36.350 --> 03:38.519

Now you've done it.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.531
Dad, you won't believe
what just happened.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.533
Hm...
You became a human mop,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.336
even though you know tomorrow
is Cleaning Fun Day?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.371
No, but good idea.

03:57.405 --> 04:00.608
I just saw two dinos from
the same family fighting,

04:00.641 --> 04:04.278
and now I get to solve
Dino Experiment 515:

04:04.312 --> 04:06.947
"Why would two dinos
from the same family fight?"

04:06.980 --> 04:09.517

Dana, where's my robe?!

04:12.553 --> 04:14.054
Surprise, surprise...

04:14.087 --> 04:16.657
Dana, give me my robe.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.827
I'm not sure you're gonna
want it back right now...

04:19.860 --> 04:21.529
[Sara]
Yes, I do.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.997
And what did Mom and Dad say
about taking my stuff?

04:25.433 --> 04:28.001
- [mouthing "Ask first."]
- Ask first?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.403
Give it.

04:30.471 --> 04:34.742

04:36.477 --> 04:40.448
- Ugh! It's soaking wet!
- That wasn't my fault.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.683
That was the dinosaurs.
I'm sure they're sorry.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.553
Y'know, maybe you'll stop
taking stuff without asking

04:45.586 --> 04:47.020
if it happens to you.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.492
- What does she mean?
- [Sara] You'll see!

04:51.525 --> 04:52.893
She'll calm down...

04:52.926 --> 04:56.464
[door slam]
...in a bit.

Have fun!

05:11.011 --> 05:13.747
Maybe don't take Sara's coat.
Too soon?

05:14.815 --> 05:18.719
[***]

05:24.124 --> 05:26.760
Hey, Kentrosaurus.
Are you thirsty?

05:26.794 --> 05:31.732
[Kentrosaurus
groaning and snuffling]

05:33.801 --> 05:35.903
Here you go...

05:35.936 --> 05:38.372
Now to solve Dino Experiment 515

05:38.406 --> 05:41.709
and see why you would fight with
someone in your own family.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.445
Sara and I only fight
when she doesn't understand

05:44.478 --> 05:47.147
that sometimes I need to borrow
her stuff without asking

05:47.180 --> 05:49.016
to finish important
dinosaur research,

05:49.049 --> 05:52.786
like what do dinosaurs in the
same family have to fight about?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.755
There's only one way
to find out.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.824
But because
stegosaurus isn't around,

05:56.857 --> 06:00.127
looks like you're gonna have to
fight me, Kentrosaurus.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.795
[surprised grunt]

06:01.829 --> 06:04.364
[Dana]
That's right-- Stegosaurus time!

06:06.434 --> 06:09.737
Dad...
Where's my backpack?

06:11.204 --> 06:14.808
Oh, you mean...
this?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.777
You look...

06:16.810 --> 06:18.512
amazing!

06:18.546 --> 06:21.915
But I need my backpack
so I can become a stegosaurus

06:21.949 --> 06:23.917
and fight the kentrosaurus.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.152
Oh, sorry.

06:25.185 --> 06:28.088
I need it for
my own experiment.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.036
It's probably going to
take a long time to solve.

You may have my backpack,

06:47.475 --> 06:49.209
and all my stuff,

06:49.242 --> 06:51.211
but you will never have...

06:51.244 --> 06:53.080
Crafter Day.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.986
Dad, how fast can you build
a stegosaurus costume?

06:59.019 --> 07:01.655
- How many spikes does it have?
- Twenty-four.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.588
You are!

08:07.621 --> 08:10.257
You're fighting over who
gets to drink the water.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.026
I knew some dinosaurs competed
for food and water.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.628
I guess I just thought

08:14.662 --> 08:16.564
dinosaurs from the same
family would share.

Whoa!

08:17.998 --> 08:20.100

08:20.133 --> 08:23.537
But how do I get you two
to stop fighting now?

Think, Dana, think...

08:28.241 --> 08:32.179
[dinos growling]

08:33.346 --> 08:34.948
Okay, you two...

Cool off!

Be patient, Kentro.

from the same family,

08:53.934 --> 08:55.803
like the Kentrosaurus
and the stegosaurus,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.671
would compete for
food and water.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.073
And now that you've
both got what you want,

09:00.107 --> 09:01.842
you don't need to
fight any more!

09:03.243 --> 09:06.313
Isn't it better--

but I thought of
something else--

09:27.367 --> 09:29.803
Something I wanted to give you.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.241
Did you make this...
for me?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.909
- Yeah.
- Dana!

are of you wearing my stuff.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.649

Exactly.

I'm going to call it
the "Seester Ask Me" box.

If I ever need to borrow
something and you're not around,

09:47.655 --> 09:50.223
I'll write it down
and put it in this box

09:50.257 --> 09:52.826
so you know that
I knew I should ask

09:52.860 --> 09:54.762
and didn't just take it.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.263
Do you like it?

09:56.296 --> 09:58.265
I love it!

13:03.150 --> 13:05.953
Hold that thought, nugget.
How can I help you, sir?

13:05.986 --> 13:09.189
When she asked me to pet-sit,
I assumed she had a dog,

13:09.222 --> 13:11.391
or a cat, or a gerbil.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.093
- What? Who?
- Lisa...

13:13.126 --> 13:14.995
That's my girlfriend.
Well, we're dating.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.396
I think she's my girlfriend.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.198
Is three weeks long enough
to say girlfriend?

13:18.231 --> 13:20.000
Sir, is there...?

13:20.033 --> 13:22.402
Well, I didn't think
she'd have a pet... THIS.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.172
A snake?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.307
Mom, that's what
I saw at the park--

13:27.340 --> 13:29.209
except a way bigger version.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.610
Bigger than this?

13:30.643 --> 13:31.879
That sounds terrifying.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.346
Terrifyingly awesome!

13:33.380 --> 13:36.349
The snake I saw was
the biggest one of all time.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.518
It's as long as from...

13:38.551 --> 13:39.887
here...

13:39.920 --> 13:42.022
to all the way over here.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.892
- What is happening?
- Guess what its name was.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.229
I'll give you a hint.
It has "boa" in it.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.363
Give up?
It's Titanoboa.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.099
Doesn't that sound cool?

13:52.132 --> 13:54.534
- Its name means "titanic boa."
- Let's not overwhelm...

13:54.567 --> 13:57.404
Stuart, and I think we're
a bit too late for that.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.239
Can I sit down
and get some water?

13:59.272 --> 14:00.607
I think I'm gonna pass out.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.343
- Of course. Come sit over here.
- Okay.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.246
She's gonna dump me.
She's going to dump me.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.181
She's totally going to dump me!

14:08.215 --> 14:10.918
Stuart, she's not going to
break up with you.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.653
- What happened?
- I broke her snake in half.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.022
[both]
What?!

14:15.055 --> 14:16.389
Look for yourself.

14:16.423 --> 14:20.427
[***]

14:20.460 --> 14:22.562
Whoa...

14:22.595 --> 14:24.331
What is this?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.900
The end of my relationship,
that's what that is.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.969
Actually, Stuart,
it's nothing to worry about.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.971
[gag]
I'm going to be sick.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.207
It's just snake skin.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.676
Snakes shed their skin
a few times a year

14:36.709 --> 14:38.678
to help them grow
and stay healthy.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.447
It's a natural process.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.449
Shedding your entire body
is normal?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.952
[chuckle] Stuart,
would you like me to show you

14:44.985 --> 14:46.453
how to handle her properly?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.389
I bet Lisa would like it
if you two became friends.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.657
Really?

14:50.690 --> 14:52.559
Mom, aren't all snakes
poisonous?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.561
- [yelp]
- Dana, you're right.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.629
We should always be
careful around snakes.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.066
But this snake
isn't poisonous.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.668
- It's a boa constrictor.
- How can you tell?

15:01.701 --> 15:04.404
- Yeah, how do you know?
- I'll show you.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.340
First, let's put you
back in your crate.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.342
Poisonous snakes
get their prey

15:09.376 --> 15:11.511
by biting them
with their fangs,

15:11.544 --> 15:14.247
these very pointy teeth
in the front.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.448
Take a look, Dana.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.683
Whoa.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.986
Super pointy.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.321
But constrictors
don't have poison...

15:21.354 --> 15:23.356
or fangs.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.557
See?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.393
No pointy front teeth.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.196
[Dana]
No fangs, no poison.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.265
Instead they grab
their prey,

15:32.299 --> 15:34.567
and wrap around,
and squeeze like this!

15:34.601 --> 15:36.603
[Dana]
[laugh] Mom!

15:36.636 --> 15:38.071
Killer hugs?

15:38.105 --> 15:39.406
Snakes are horrible.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.274
No, snakes are incredible.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.444
Snakes have been around for over
one hundred million years.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.613
That's way longer than
people've been around.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.649
And I just got an idea
for a new dino experiment!

15:49.682 --> 15:51.284
Dino Experiment 511:

15:51.318 --> 15:53.353
"Was the Titanoboa poisonous
or a constrictor?"

15:53.386 --> 15:56.489
- I need to go back to the park.
- Excuse me!

15:57.590 --> 16:00.027
Mom, can I go
back to the park

16:00.060 --> 16:02.162
to finish an important
scientific experiment?

16:02.195 --> 16:04.164
Well, when you put it that way.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.532
It's Titanoboa time.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.669
The first step
in snake handling

16:09.702 --> 16:11.671
is actually touching
the snake.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.507
With... with my hands?

16:14.541 --> 16:16.109
[whimper]

16:16.143 --> 16:19.479
[***]

16:19.512 --> 16:22.415
Time to see if you have
poisonous fangs or not.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.551
Hiss!
[shout]

16:27.320 --> 16:28.688
Hey there.

16:28.721 --> 16:33.593
Just slithering by
and wanted to say "Hiss!"

16:33.626 --> 16:37.630
Now open your mouth
and say "Titanoboaaaa..."

16:37.664 --> 16:38.698
Oh!

16:38.731 --> 16:41.601
Ugh.
My mouth was open.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.270
Wait, Titanoboa!
Come back!

16:43.303 --> 16:45.672
I still need to
see if you have fangs

16:45.705 --> 16:47.574
to help me solve my
dino experiment!

16:49.542 --> 16:51.078
What is this?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.415
Just the Titanoboa's old skin.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.418
That's not going to help me
solve my dino experiment.

16:58.451 --> 17:02.822
[***]

17:02.855 --> 17:05.425
It feels...
smooth!

17:05.458 --> 17:08.061
I was expecting
cold and slimy.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.197
Snakes aren't exactly what
you thought they are, huh?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.631
Mom!

17:11.664 --> 17:13.600
Dana, we were just getting
Stuart comfortable.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.735
Well, don't-- I found
the Titanoboa in the park,

17:15.768 --> 17:18.505
but before I could see
if it had fangs or not,

17:18.538 --> 17:20.773
it licked me right
across my face.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.742
Get your face away
from that thing.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.344
Okay, let's relax.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.079
Snakes use their
tongue to smell.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.680
- They do?
- [Mom] Yes!

17:27.714 --> 17:30.417
It's how they find their food
so the ti- ti- ti...

17:30.450 --> 17:31.851
Titanoboa.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.686
...the Titanoboa was
probably just smelling you

17:33.720 --> 17:36.289
the same way Lisa's snake
is trying to smell Stuart.

17:36.323 --> 17:39.192
You mean the Titanoboa
might be looking for its prey?

17:39.226 --> 17:41.494
- Maybe.
- And if she finds it,

17:41.528 --> 17:44.497
I'll be able to see if she's
poisonous or a constrictor?

17:44.531 --> 17:45.565
I guess so.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.267
- Can I...
- Have fun.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.270
- Oh man. Is she hunting me?
- No, it's fine.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.605
- Is she hunting me?
- No, she's just saying--

17:52.639 --> 17:54.507
- It's the look of death!
- Just smelling.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.842
- It's the look of death!
- She's just smelling.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.211
- No, it isn't.
- Stuart, relax.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.613
[Dana]
Titanoboaaaa!

18:00.647 --> 18:02.315
Where are you?

18:03.383 --> 18:04.817
[roar]

18:05.685 --> 18:07.320
Sorry, T-rex.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.322
I'm looking for history's
biggest snake,

18:09.356 --> 18:11.291
not history's
most famous dinosaur.

18:11.324 --> 18:14.361
[growl]

18:14.394 --> 18:16.196
Unless the king
of the dinosaurs

18:16.229 --> 18:17.730
was prey for
the Titanoboa.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.233
Hey, T-Rex!
Wait up.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.836
[sniffing]

18:23.870 --> 18:26.439
Looks like you smell
the old-fashioned way--

18:26.473 --> 18:27.874
with your nose.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.743
[hissing]

18:30.777 --> 18:32.245
The Titanoboa!

18:32.279 --> 18:34.414
Now's my chance
to see if you were

18:34.447 --> 18:37.150
poisonous or
a constrictor.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.352
Hey, T-Rex!

18:39.386 --> 18:40.720
[groan]

18:40.753 --> 18:43.290
Want some beef jerky?

18:43.323 --> 18:47.327
[dino noises]

18:47.360 --> 18:49.196
[hiss]

18:49.229 --> 18:50.430
[roar]

18:50.463 --> 18:53.333
The Titanoboa
has no pointy fangs,

18:53.366 --> 18:55.835
which means it must be a...

18:55.868 --> 18:57.370
constrictor.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.906
But you seem a little bit small

18:59.939 --> 19:01.641
to take down the T-Rex.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.543
Oh no.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.678
Did I lead the T-Rex to you?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.280
Think, Dana, think.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.249
How can you save
the Titanoboa?

19:10.317 --> 19:14.587
[***]

19:18.725 --> 19:23.263
[***]

19:24.731 --> 19:26.633
Hey, T-Rex!

19:26.666 --> 19:28.301
Over here!

19:28.335 --> 19:31.404
Want some yummy Titanoboa?

19:34.407 --> 19:35.775
It's working!

19:35.808 --> 19:39.212
[growling and roaring]

19:43.850 --> 19:47.787
Thanks for helping me solve
dino experiment 511, Titanoboa.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.290
You definitely were
a constrictor.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.292
[hiss]

19:52.325 --> 19:53.726
Weeeee!

19:53.760 --> 19:55.695
Bye, T-Rex!

19:56.763 --> 20:00.700
[***]

20:01.768 --> 20:03.836
Mom, guess what?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.305
Whoa.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.640
Stuart, you're
holding the snake!

20:07.674 --> 20:09.876
Uh huh.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.378
Take the picture...

20:11.411 --> 20:12.545
Take the picture.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.247
Say "Titanoboa!"

20:14.281 --> 20:15.815
[others]
Titanoboa!

20:15.848 --> 20:17.584
[beep]

20:17.617 --> 20:20.587
Aw, I think Lisa
will love this.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.789
Aw, thanks.

20:22.822 --> 20:23.890
Your mom's the best.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.325
[chuckle]

20:25.358 --> 20:27.327
- Bye.
- [chuckle]

20:27.360 --> 20:28.861
- Hey, Mom...
- Yeah, hun?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.664
- You really are the best.
- Aw, thanks, nugget.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.834
Do you think maybe
WE can get a pet snake?

20:34.867 --> 20:37.404
- Absolutely not.
- But mom! C'mon, mom!

20:37.437 --> 20:39.772
- Nope! No way!
- They're so cute...

20:41.974 --> 20:46.913
