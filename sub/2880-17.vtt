WEBVTT

00:03.060 --> 00:04.193
Raj, your tag's
sticking out.

00:04.195 --> 00:05.261
Thank you.

00:05.263 --> 00:06.629
That was the closest
I've come to sex

00:06.631 --> 00:07.830
in, like, two years.

00:09.166 --> 00:11.968
Now I feel a
little gross.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.704
You're only making it seem
more real for me.

00:15.773 --> 00:17.540
Hey, that's my wife.

00:17.542 --> 00:20.076
If anyone's gonna make her feel
gross about sex, it's me.

00:21.178 --> 00:22.612
Can we please talk
about something

00:22.614 --> 00:24.514
other than my
depressing love life?

00:24.516 --> 00:26.683
How about Penny's
depressing acting career?

00:27.985 --> 00:29.152
Hey.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.787
I mean, it's been
a little tough,

00:30.789 --> 00:32.220
but Penny's following
her dreams,

00:32.223 --> 00:34.257
and in my book,
that is not depressing.

00:34.259 --> 00:36.125
Aw... Thank you.

00:36.127 --> 00:38.861
Is that book called
<i>Lies I Tell to Get Sex?</i>

00:39.563 --> 00:40.797
Is that
a real book?

00:40.799 --> 00:42.565
I would totally
read that book.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.601
Can I borrow it
when you're done?

00:50.174 --> 00:51.307
Well, I'll have
you guys know

00:51.309 --> 00:53.309
I turned down a part
in a movie last week.

00:53.311 --> 00:54.544
Why would you do that?

00:54.546 --> 00:55.745
Because it was crap.

00:55.747 --> 00:57.080
It's a sequel to that awful

00:57.082 --> 00:58.314
killer gorilla movie I was in.

00:58.316 --> 01:00.249
<i>Serial Ape-ist?</i>

01:01.218 --> 01:03.219
I thought you
died in that.

01:03.221 --> 01:04.220
She does.

01:04.221 --> 01:05.288
42 minutes in.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.223
While showering topless,

01:07.225 --> 01:08.558
16 minutes after
brief side butt

01:08.560 --> 01:10.440
during a pillow fight
with her sorority sisters.

01:12.563 --> 01:14.130
I have an eidetic memory.

01:14.132 --> 01:15.832
I don't know what
his problem is.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.968
Okay, well, there are no
shower scenes in this one.

01:18.970 --> 01:20.870
They just try to clone me
from my corpse,

01:20.872 --> 01:22.705
but my DNA gets mixed
with the ape's DNA

01:22.707 --> 01:25.508
and I end up running around with
giant gorilla hands and feet.

01:27.144 --> 01:29.045
Am I missing something,

01:29.047 --> 01:31.114
or isn't that the part
she was born to play?

02:01.974 --> 02:05.110
So are you really not
gonna do this movie?

02:05.112 --> 02:06.678
Well, I don't think
it's the kind of part

02:06.680 --> 02:07.946
that's good for my career.

02:07.948 --> 02:10.482
Well, but don't
a lot of famous actors

02:10.484 --> 02:12.283
get their start
doing bad movies?

02:12.285 --> 02:14.786
Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep
ever had to say...

02:14.788 --> 02:16.588
"Must keep gorilla hands

02:16.590 --> 02:18.790
from killing again!"

02:21.327 --> 02:22.894
If she did, it would be amazing.

02:22.896 --> 02:25.697
That woman can do no wrong.

02:26.766 --> 02:29.100
I-I don't know anything
about show business,

02:29.102 --> 02:31.836
so if you think it's reasonable
to turn down paid work

02:31.838 --> 02:33.204
and just burn through
your savings,

02:33.206 --> 02:34.839
I'm sure you know
what you're doing.

02:40.346 --> 02:43.081
I think we're gonna go.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.082
Are you sure?

02:44.084 --> 02:46.618
We were making fun
of failed careers.

02:46.620 --> 02:49.587
We didn't get to tap
the juicy vein that is Howard's.

02:50.589 --> 02:53.692
Hey, I work
at the same university you do.

02:53.694 --> 02:56.027
Yes, and Hawkeye's
in the Avengers,

02:56.029 --> 02:58.730
but no one ever says,
"Help, Hawkeye!"

02:59.999 --> 03:01.833
Can I ask you
something?

03:01.835 --> 03:04.502
Why do you constantly feel
the need to put down my husband?

03:04.504 --> 03:05.537
Oh, I'm sure

03:05.539 --> 03:06.638
he does it out of love.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.673
The same way my boyfriend
makes me feel terrible

03:08.675 --> 03:11.476
about my life choices.

03:12.678 --> 03:15.480
I think we're gonna go.

03:15.482 --> 03:17.515
No, no, no. This is not a fight.

03:17.517 --> 03:20.585
I-I was just excited that
someone offered you a part

03:20.587 --> 03:22.220
and a little surprised
that you'd rather sit at home

03:22.222 --> 03:23.955
and do nothing than take it.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.694
Now it's a fight.

03:30.496 --> 03:32.464
Well, with
that sorted out,

03:32.466 --> 03:34.532
I'm happy to answer your
question, Bernadette.

03:34.534 --> 03:35.867
Howard started it.

03:35.869 --> 03:39.070
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.

03:39.072 --> 03:40.238
I wasn't referring
to this evening.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.474
Ten years ago,
upon first seeing me,

03:42.476 --> 03:45.176
your husband claimed
that I looked like C-3PO

03:45.178 --> 03:47.545
and Pee-wee Herman.

03:49.115 --> 03:52.484
And he called me
C-3P-wee Herman.

03:54.453 --> 03:56.855
Still funny.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.459
That was ten years ago.

04:01.461 --> 04:04.162
Nine years, 11 months
and three weeks ago,

04:04.164 --> 04:07.398
he followed that up by replacing
the slides for my lecture

04:07.400 --> 04:10.902
with photographs
of nude fat women bending over.

04:11.737 --> 04:13.538
Really?

04:13.540 --> 04:15.874
The lecture was
on cosmic gas clouds.

04:15.876 --> 04:17.408
That's funny!

04:19.144 --> 04:21.745
I was there. It was funny.

04:25.718 --> 04:28.653
In any event, that began
a decade-long progression

04:28.655 --> 04:32.457
of insults, pranks and
unwanted magazine subscriptions.

04:32.459 --> 04:34.759
To this day,
I still get a monthly copy

04:34.761 --> 04:37.328
of <i>Granny on Granny.</i>

04:38.664 --> 04:40.398
Which, other than its
surprisingly fun puzzle page,

04:40.400 --> 04:41.866
is complete filth.

04:44.804 --> 04:47.505
Thanks for walking me
to my car.

04:47.507 --> 04:49.808
Actually,
it's for both of us.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.342
Last night, I watched
<i>West Side Story,</i>

04:51.344 --> 04:54.345
and I'm a little freaked out
by street gangs.

04:54.347 --> 04:56.648
Why can't Raj find a girl?

04:56.650 --> 04:59.617
The mystery continues.

04:59.619 --> 05:02.353
I don't appreciate
your sarcasm,

05:02.355 --> 05:05.790
but we've still got two blocks
to go, so I'll put up with it.

05:06.859 --> 05:09.160
Whatever happened with
your online dating?

05:09.162 --> 05:12.630
No one was writing me back, so
I stopped checking my profile.

05:12.632 --> 05:15.300
Before I met Sheldon,
I was ready to give up, too.

05:15.302 --> 05:17.368
Once, I even dropped
in on my OB/GYN

05:17.370 --> 05:20.338
just to get some
human contact.

05:20.340 --> 05:24.275
It has been a while
since I got my prostate checked.

05:24.277 --> 05:27.879
Then I met Sheldon and
look at where we are now.

05:27.881 --> 05:31.716
What? You've kissed, like,
once in three years.

05:32.651 --> 05:35.486
That's true.
Do whatever you want.

05:37.489 --> 05:38.756
Hey.

05:38.758 --> 05:40.058
Hello.

05:40.060 --> 05:42.527
Listen, I was thinking

05:42.529 --> 05:47.098
you and I could probably try
to be better friends.

05:47.100 --> 05:48.366
Really?

05:48.368 --> 05:51.669
I was thinking
what we have now is a bit much.

05:54.640 --> 05:59.444
Seriously, I was talking
to Bernadette last night and...

05:59.446 --> 06:01.412
she made some great points.

06:01.414 --> 06:04.382
You and I have known each other
a long time,

06:04.384 --> 06:08.653
and I didn't hear the rest
'cause she took her bra off.

06:10.890 --> 06:13.157
Very well.

06:13.159 --> 06:15.326
How do you propose
we move forward?

06:15.328 --> 06:19.764
Uh, for starters, we could stop
insulting each other.

06:19.766 --> 06:21.232
That's a great idea.

06:21.234 --> 06:23.568
And in the spirit
of our new arrangement,

06:23.570 --> 06:27.338
I will mask my surprise
that you came up with it.

06:31.377 --> 06:34.479
Anyway, I got invited
to do a little talk at NASA

06:34.481 --> 06:36.114
in Houston this weekend.

06:36.116 --> 06:38.316
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.

06:38.318 --> 06:39.817
You want to come with me?

06:39.819 --> 06:41.452
You can visit
your mom,

06:41.454 --> 06:43.721
and I'll show you
around the space center.

06:43.723 --> 06:46.724
I have one question.

06:46.726 --> 06:48.693
Is this a prank...

06:48.695 --> 06:50.662
where we land in Houston

06:50.664 --> 06:52.363
and you've made up
wanted posters

06:52.365 --> 06:55.333
that have my face with
a mustache and a Spanish name

06:55.335 --> 06:59.003
and then I get arrested
and deported to South America?

06:59.005 --> 07:01.139
No.

07:01.141 --> 07:03.808
I'm glad because I would not
have seen that coming.

07:07.546 --> 07:09.847
Amy, I could use
some help.

07:09.849 --> 07:11.516
Oh. Let me guess.
There's an...

07:11.518 --> 07:12.951
undergrad in a leather jacket

07:12.953 --> 07:15.320
snapping his fingers
by the water fountain.

07:16.221 --> 07:19.557
I thought about
what you said last night,

07:19.559 --> 07:21.125
and I went back
on the dating Web site

07:21.127 --> 07:22.927
and I was looking
at this girl's profile.

07:22.929 --> 07:24.929
She's amazing.

07:24.931 --> 07:27.498
Oh, she's cute.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.400
And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.

07:29.402 --> 07:30.902
And judging by her lack
of Adam's apple,

07:30.904 --> 07:33.438
she's been female
her entire life.

07:35.741 --> 07:38.543
I like that in a woman.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.379
Great,
so what do you need me for?

07:41.381 --> 07:42.947
Well, I was up all night trying
to write to her,

07:42.949 --> 07:44.482
but I wanted
to run it by you first.

07:44.484 --> 07:46.784
All right.

07:47.619 --> 07:50.221
"Emily,

07:50.223 --> 07:53.424
your face is like
a precious dew-kissed flower..."

07:53.426 --> 07:55.059
Wow.

07:55.061 --> 07:57.528
I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?

07:57.530 --> 07:59.263
No.

07:59.265 --> 08:01.532
You're supposed to be yourself,
not all...

08:01.534 --> 08:03.501
desperate and creepy.

08:03.503 --> 08:07.205
Okay, I'm getting
some mixed messages here.

08:07.207 --> 08:10.975
Just say something normal
like, "I saw your profile.

08:10.977 --> 08:13.578
"Looks like we have a
lot in common; let's get

08:13.580 --> 08:16.547
a cup of coffee sometime."
Yes. "Where I can be

08:16.549 --> 08:20.318
jealous of the cup
touching your ruby lips."

08:22.154 --> 08:23.721
Or you just write it for me.

08:23.723 --> 08:25.289
I'm not gonna pretend to be you.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.858
I don't want you
to pretend to be me.

08:26.860 --> 08:29.060
You can be like my,
uh, online wingman.

08:29.062 --> 08:31.963
Like if we met her at a bar
and you talked me up.

08:31.965 --> 08:33.965
Well, what would I say to her?

08:33.967 --> 08:36.299
Just tell her
what I'm really like.

08:36.302 --> 08:39.570
And, if you think
it'll help,

08:39.572 --> 08:42.106
that you saw me changing once
and my package reminded you

08:42.107 --> 08:44.642
of the muscular tail
of a jaguar.

08:49.715 --> 08:52.183
Use your own words.

08:54.953 --> 08:57.655
Thanks again for taking me
to the pharmacy.

08:57.657 --> 08:59.957
Oh, it's no problem.
Is everything okay?

08:59.959 --> 09:01.659
Oh, I'm fine.
It's just some, uh,

09:01.661 --> 09:03.795
stomach medication for my trip.

09:03.797 --> 09:06.731
There's the remote
yet distinct possibility

09:06.733 --> 09:10.301
that I may end up
in South America.

09:11.470 --> 09:13.704
Remember the old days when I
would've said something dumb

09:13.706 --> 09:15.673
like "Why?"

09:20.379 --> 09:22.213
Uh, that doesn't
sound good.

09:22.215 --> 09:25.083
Remember the old days
when I used to point out

09:25.085 --> 09:27.452
that your check engine light
was on?

09:28.120 --> 09:29.921
Yes.
Well, get ready

09:29.923 --> 09:32.390
to stroll down memory lane:
Penny, your check engine...

09:32.392 --> 09:34.025
Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon!

09:34.027 --> 09:38.296
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.

09:38.298 --> 09:40.231
Maybe it's just something minor.

09:48.574 --> 09:50.842
Ooh, good news,
the light just went out.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:00.475 --> 10:02.542
Are we playing
individual or teams?

10:02.544 --> 10:03.710
Teams are fun.

10:03.712 --> 10:05.812
Oh, in that case,
I'd like to be partnered

10:05.814 --> 10:07.347
with my good friend Howard.

10:07.349 --> 10:09.416
But I'm always on Howard's team.

10:09.418 --> 10:10.350
We're best friends.

10:10.352 --> 10:14.021
The kind who finish
each others...

10:16.691 --> 10:18.659
I really don't think
we do tha...

10:18.661 --> 10:19.926
...do that! See?

10:21.763 --> 10:23.764
Oh, hi.
Oh, how'd it go

10:23.766 --> 10:24.998
at the mechanic?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.600
Not great. Can I talk to you
for a sec?

10:26.602 --> 10:28.902
Yeah, sure.

10:28.904 --> 10:31.538
Maybe I can go with you
guys to Houston?

10:31.540 --> 10:33.573
Isn't it a little late
to get plane tick...

10:33.575 --> 10:35.609
...plane tickets? Yeah.

10:35.611 --> 10:37.711
Will you please sto...

10:37.713 --> 10:39.546
...stop that? Okay.

10:39.548 --> 10:41.782
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

10:41.784 --> 10:44.284
My car threw a rod
and it's totaled.

10:44.286 --> 10:46.119
I can't afford a new one,
I have no job,

10:46.121 --> 10:47.487
and now I can't drive
to auditions.

10:47.489 --> 10:48.455
I'm so sorry.

10:48.457 --> 10:51.091
I know it's
a sensitive subject,

10:51.093 --> 10:53.460
but can you reconsider
that part in the movie?

10:53.462 --> 10:55.495
I did. I called them.
The part's gone.

10:55.497 --> 10:57.030
They gave it to someone else.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.066
Now that girl's gonna get
discovered and become famous

10:59.068 --> 11:02.302
and go on <i>Letterman</i> and talk
about how she got her big break

11:02.304 --> 11:03.603
on a cheap monkey movie

11:03.605 --> 11:06.840
all because some dumb girl
thought it was beneath her.

11:06.842 --> 11:10.277
At least they talked
about you on <i>Letterman.</i>

11:12.113 --> 11:15.015
Come on, I can drive you
wherever you need to go.

11:15.017 --> 11:17.084
How? Unlike me,
you have a job.

11:17.086 --> 11:19.953
I'm just gonna have to go back
to being a waitress... - Oh.

11:19.955 --> 11:22.589
...like I will be
for the rest of my life.

11:22.591 --> 11:24.091
Leonard, would you wrap it up?

11:24.093 --> 11:25.759
We're waiting on you.

11:25.761 --> 11:27.994
I'm sorry, is the fact
that my life's falling apart

11:27.996 --> 11:29.663
interfering
with your board game?

11:29.665 --> 11:32.265
It is.

11:34.102 --> 11:36.236
You were wrong, friend Howard.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.438
She completely understood.

11:42.511 --> 11:43.710
Hey, you busy?

11:43.712 --> 11:44.911
No. What's up?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.880
Have you heard
back from Emily?

11:46.882 --> 11:48.014
I have.

11:48.016 --> 11:49.182
Great! And?

11:49.184 --> 11:50.584
And I'm afraid

11:50.586 --> 11:52.853
she doesn't think
you're right for her.

11:54.655 --> 11:57.624
I give you
one simple thing to do--

11:57.626 --> 12:00.761
contact a complete stranger and
make her fall in love with me--

12:00.763 --> 12:02.562
and you blow it!

12:02.564 --> 12:05.799
I told her
what a good guy you are, but

12:05.801 --> 12:07.868
she thought it
was a bad sign

12:07.870 --> 12:09.870
that you didn't write
to her yourself.

12:09.872 --> 12:13.807
She thought it made you seem
too shy and passive.

12:13.809 --> 12:15.675
I'm not too shy and passive.

12:15.677 --> 12:18.311
You write her back
and tell her I said that.

12:18.313 --> 12:21.381
You know,
when you have a second.

12:21.383 --> 12:24.885
Look, I'll see if I can change
her mind tomorrow night.

12:24.887 --> 12:26.520
What's happening tomorrow night?

12:26.522 --> 12:28.054
I'm meeting her for coffee.

12:28.056 --> 12:29.489
What?!

12:29.491 --> 12:31.558
Well, we just... we e-mailed
back and forth a bit,

12:31.560 --> 12:33.059
and we kind of
hit it off.

12:33.061 --> 12:35.343
I find a girl I like,
and you're stealing her?!

12:35.368 --> 12:35.963
No.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.831
We just ended up
having a lot in common.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.933
We went to Harvard,
we like Chaucer,

12:39.935 --> 12:42.669
we're both hardcore
into quilting.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.407
Your words fall like acid rain

12:47.409 --> 12:49.643
on the wounded petals
of my heart.

12:51.913 --> 12:53.547
That's Sheldon.

12:53.549 --> 12:55.515
He says he'll be down
in a minute.

12:55.517 --> 12:57.517
What are you doing?

12:57.519 --> 13:00.153
Oh, he's not coming out
until he sees proof

13:00.155 --> 13:02.722
you don't have an air freshener
in your car.

13:03.758 --> 13:06.726
This is gonna be a long weekend
for you.

13:06.728 --> 13:09.396
You're the reason I'm doing it!
I said

13:09.398 --> 13:10.764
to stop insulting each other.

13:10.766 --> 13:13.867
I didn't tell you to take him
on a romantic getaway.

13:13.869 --> 13:16.670
How do I know
what you said?

13:16.672 --> 13:19.739
Damn you and your
noise-cancelling breasts.

13:22.611 --> 13:23.743
Hello.

13:23.745 --> 13:25.445
Hi.
Hey, buddy.

13:25.447 --> 13:27.547
You excited for Texas?

13:27.549 --> 13:29.883
Oh, very much so.

13:29.885 --> 13:32.953
It's not every day you get to
tour NASA with a real astronaut.

13:32.955 --> 13:36.089
Who's the real astronaut?

13:37.558 --> 13:39.659
Buzz Aldrin.

13:39.661 --> 13:42.095
Oh. Yay!

13:54.208 --> 13:55.909
Howard?

13:55.911 --> 13:57.944
Howard?

13:57.946 --> 14:00.146
Howard?

14:01.849 --> 14:03.817
What now?

14:03.819 --> 14:06.119
I have to go
to the bathroom.

14:06.121 --> 14:07.654
You just went
to the bathroom.

14:07.656 --> 14:10.357
I didn't use it because
it didn't seem safe.

14:10.359 --> 14:14.461
Despite all my e-mails, the
toilet didn't have a seatbelt.

14:15.830 --> 14:17.764
Well, it still doesn't.

14:17.766 --> 14:19.299
I realize that,

14:19.301 --> 14:22.969
but safety concerns went out
the window two apple juices ago.

14:22.971 --> 14:25.071
Fine.

14:26.307 --> 14:28.441
Why are you
getting annoyed?

14:28.443 --> 14:31.011
I'm trying to be
a better friend,

14:31.013 --> 14:34.581
but you constantly say
and do irritating things.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.683
Like when?
When?!

14:36.685 --> 14:37.984
How about in the car?

14:37.986 --> 14:40.320
I'm an astronaut,
and you know it.

14:40.322 --> 14:43.356
You just don't like admitting
it, because you're jealous.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.561
Well, truth be told,

14:48.563 --> 14:51.164
as a child, I did dream
of going to space.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.133
Those astronauts
were my heroes.

14:53.135 --> 14:55.268
And...

14:55.270 --> 14:58.471
when you got to go,
it was hard for me.

14:59.340 --> 15:01.341
Thank you.

15:01.343 --> 15:03.443
Because it made me
realize they'll just

15:03.445 --> 15:05.645
send anyone up there.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.949
Aren't you going
to let me out?

15:08.951 --> 15:09.459
No.

15:09.484 --> 15:11.385
But I still need
to use the bathroom.

15:11.386 --> 15:14.654
Here you go. Be creative.

15:17.392 --> 15:20.126
What's the matter?
Scared of a little turbulence?

15:20.128 --> 15:23.430
No, turbulence is
just the equalization

15:23.432 --> 15:25.532
of diurnal temperature
variations in the atmosphere.

15:25.534 --> 15:27.334
I'm not scared at all.

15:28.704 --> 15:30.937
Oh, apple juice,
stay where you are.

15:31.772 --> 15:33.373
Oh, this is nothing.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.041
I experienced way worse

15:35.043 --> 15:37.043
when I was plummeting
back to Earth,

15:37.045 --> 15:39.579
apparently not being
a real astronaut.

15:41.917 --> 15:44.884
Okay, that was a big one.

15:44.886 --> 15:46.987
I take it back. I'm
scared of turbulence!

15:46.989 --> 15:48.888
I'm gonna need
that bag back.

15:52.693 --> 15:54.194
You sure you want
to do this?

15:54.196 --> 15:56.629
Yeah. Why wouldn't I want
to get my old job back?

15:56.631 --> 15:58.098
It'll be fun to see everyone.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.066
I haven't talked to them
since I said,

16:00.068 --> 16:02.535
"I quit. See you
at the Oscars, bitches."

16:03.504 --> 16:05.638
Come on, let's just
get this over with.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.873
"Let's get this over with."

16:06.875 --> 16:08.808
Am I driving you
to the Cheesecake Factory,

16:08.810 --> 16:10.276
or are we having sex?

16:11.379 --> 16:13.680
I'm just... I'm trying
to lighten the mood.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.515
I know. Thank you.
Sorry.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.117
It's just so
humiliating.

16:17.119 --> 16:18.251
So humiliating?

16:18.253 --> 16:20.253
Am I driving you to
the Cheesecake Factory...?

16:20.255 --> 16:22.322
I'm sorry.
I'll-I'll stop. I'll stop.

16:25.204 --> 16:26.671
Come on, don't
look so sad.

16:26.673 --> 16:28.139
You never know
what's gonna happen.

16:28.141 --> 16:30.575
Maybe tonight will be great.
Sweetie, I know you're trying

16:30.577 --> 16:32.911
to make me feel better,
and I love you for that,

16:32.913 --> 16:36.748
but it's making me feel worse,
and I kind of hate you.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.517
This isn't your car.

16:39.519 --> 16:42.987
I know. I thought
we'd take yours.

16:44.323 --> 16:46.491
I don't understand.

16:47.693 --> 16:49.994
It's nothing fancy,
but it'll get you to auditions,

16:49.996 --> 16:53.598
and at least for now, you don't
have to go back to waitressing.

16:55.034 --> 16:57.535
I don't know what to say.

16:57.537 --> 17:00.171
Don't say anything.

17:00.173 --> 17:02.240
Oh, my God.

17:02.242 --> 17:04.541
I mean, you could say,
"Thank you."

17:04.544 --> 17:06.644
I did just buy you a car.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.948
Mmm.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.251
Look, I admit
that it's odd

17:13.252 --> 17:15.420
that Rajesh didn't
write to you himself,

17:15.422 --> 17:17.188
but if you get to know him,

17:17.190 --> 17:19.457
you'll see
he's just a sweet, regular guy.

17:19.459 --> 17:22.694
As a counterpoint, here he is,
uninvited and visibly sweaty.

17:22.695 --> 17:24.395
Hello, Emily.

17:24.396 --> 17:25.864
Hello.
Amy told me

17:25.866 --> 17:28.900
you were concerned that I might
be too passive and shy.

17:28.902 --> 17:30.602
Let me ask you something.

17:30.604 --> 17:32.737
Would a passive guy
barge in here

17:32.739 --> 17:34.773
to look you in the eye and say,

17:34.775 --> 17:38.276
"Hey, dew-kissed flower,
what's up?"

17:41.981 --> 17:45.016
No, but a weird guy
with no boundaries might.

17:45.018 --> 17:46.551
Uh, okay, that's
a separate issue.

17:46.553 --> 17:48.943
Let's put a pin in that and just
focus on the passive thing.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.206
I'm leaving.

17:50.231 --> 17:52.572
Are we still going to go to
that Chaucer reading Friday?

17:52.959 --> 17:55.059
You know, I think
I'm just gonna go by myself.

17:58.597 --> 18:01.132
Not my best first date.

18:02.368 --> 18:04.869
Yeah, but not my worst, either.

18:09.409 --> 18:11.810
I'm sorry for every mean thing
I ever did or said to you!

18:11.812 --> 18:13.678
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!

18:15.282 --> 18:16.481
If you weren't my friend,

18:16.483 --> 18:18.149
there'd be a
hole in my life!

18:18.151 --> 18:19.818
Thank you, Sheldon.

18:19.820 --> 18:22.153
Kind of like when
<i>Firefly</i> was cancelled.

18:22.955 --> 18:25.723
But not as big.

18:35.812 --> 18:38.374
The captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

18:38.379 --> 18:40.742
You're now free
to move about the cabin.

18:42.486 --> 18:44.519
It's over.
Yeah.

18:47.024 --> 18:50.492
Should we stop
holding hands now?

18:52.395 --> 18:54.296
In a minute.
Okay, good.
