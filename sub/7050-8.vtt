00:02.086 --> 00:03.419
Previously on Justified...

00:03.504 --> 00:06.506
He was tweaking and pissed off,
asking about Ellen May.

00:07.091 --> 00:08.341
Ellen May?

00:08.425 --> 00:10.843
Where she is or did she call or some shit.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.595
You believe me now?

00:12.763 --> 00:14.931
Boyd and Ava intended that man to kill you.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.474
To good taste.

00:16.934 --> 00:17.934
Cheers.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.061
- Lee Paxton.
- Gerald Johns.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.854
- Hello, gentlemen. I'm...
- Boyd Crowder.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.440
I'm saying go down to Tramble

00:24.525 --> 00:26.984
and talk to that guy
who used to be the Harlan sheriff.

00:27.111 --> 00:28.111
- Hunter.
- Right.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.029
And then after that, go talk to your father.

00:30.114 --> 00:33.616
We know Drew's alive and in Harlan,
but it's gonna be a bitch to find him.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.784
We could use your help.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.119
You tell me right now,

00:36.620 --> 00:40.707
I will make sure you
live out your days in a country-club jail.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.208
Eat shit.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.593
Hasn't anybody killed you yet?

00:52.678 --> 00:54.345
Try not to sound so disappointed.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.389
You forget you're the reason I'm in here.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.974
Keep telling yourself that.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.311
What is it this time, Raylan?

01:02.646 --> 01:03.896
Drew Thompson.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.399
Is there a question in there somewhere?

01:06.483 --> 01:09.235
Josiah Cairn says
if anybody would know who he is,

01:09.319 --> 01:10.361
it'd be you.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.157
Sure. I know. Drug runner. Went splat.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.491
It was in a couple papers.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.909
That's who he was.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.495
I'm asking, do you know who he is?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.664
Yeah, that's right. You're asking me,

01:21.749 --> 01:25.001
but you're asking me
like you'd ask me if I want fries with that.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.754
I can ask again. Different tone, if you like.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.507
Hey, word around the campfire,
well, Josiah lost a foot recently,

01:31.592 --> 01:33.176
and I don't mean to diabetes.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.178
Has that got something to do with this here?

01:35.262 --> 01:36.679
We can protect you.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.056
Hey, as we speak, one of your fellow inmates

01:39.183 --> 01:42.351
is cutting a deal to get a transfer to club fed.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.687
Ashland, maybe Yankton.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.815
I hear Yankton's
got the best food in the federal system.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.569
Anyway, you give him up first, deal's yours.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.530
Last time we spoke,
you said you weren't too happy

01:54.615 --> 01:56.282
with your circumstances.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.951
This fellow inmate

01:59.787 --> 02:02.747
wouldn't happen to share
a last name with you, would he?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.376
You think I don't know your daddy's in here?

02:08.377 --> 02:09.544
He murdered a trustee.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.756
People gonna notice, even at Tramble.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.383
My God, Raylan.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.679
You want to screw your daddy's deal so bad

02:18.764 --> 02:20.264
that you'd give it to me.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.226
I like you better than him.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.811
I tried to kill you.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.270
I still like you better.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.650
Look, Drew's done.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.401
With or without you.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.738
Even if you don't want the transfer,

02:36.406 --> 02:38.449
I thought there'd be
enough lawman left in you,

02:38.575 --> 02:40.409
you wouldn't want to see Arlo win.

02:40.494 --> 02:44.205
Man, you're only a lawman
when it suits you, Raylan.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.624
Gives you cover
to do things you would have done anyways.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.462
This coming from a guy
who sold his badge to a drug cartel.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.422
- Why do you care?
- About you? I don't.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.632
About Thompson.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.509
- I'm paid to care.
- Come on.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.010
Come on, now. Tell me the truth.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.972
What's in the bag for you, scarecrow?
Come on.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.266
I catch this fella, I can write my own ticket.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.392
Bullshit.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.018
You never cared about rank.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.311
Priorities change.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.025
You want the deal or not?

03:17.364 --> 03:19.198
All right, there we go.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.078
Frank... He's an oddball.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.621
He really is. Now listen.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.792
Your best bet's
wait'll he's sawing logs, right?

03:30.460 --> 03:32.628
And then you come through

03:33.463 --> 03:34.714
right here.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.300
French doors in the solarium.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.552
That's your recommendation, huh?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.470
Yeah, well, for what it's worth.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.473
Broken into a lot of houses, have you?

03:44.558 --> 03:45.975
No.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.979
I'll be the first to admit
that's more your line of work.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.522
Just my two cents is all.

03:51.607 --> 03:55.401
Well, then you won't mind
if I do my own formulating.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.322
No, just as long as you go in

03:59.406 --> 04:01.616
between 2:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.451
What difference does that make?

04:04.119 --> 04:08.956
Well 5:00, 5:30,
that's when Trish usually gets home.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.542
Wouldn't want her to be collateral damage.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.253
Well, Mrs Browning the only reason
you're concerned with my timing?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.755
Why else should I be concerned?

04:17.798 --> 04:20.301
Well, Mr Johns, it occurs to me that

04:21.136 --> 04:22.845
when I kill Frank Browning,

04:23.931 --> 04:25.389
if I were to immediately be arrested

04:25.474 --> 04:29.393
or even killed myself
by some Johnny-on-the-spot Johnny Laws,

04:29.978 --> 04:33.314
well, you and your friends
might see that as two problems solved.

04:33.482 --> 04:34.732
No.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.525
Boyd, we don't look at you as a problem.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.235
Not at all.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.112
I got a boy who mows my lawn,

04:40.197 --> 04:42.740
I got a boy
that does my shoes at lunch time, and you...

04:42.824 --> 04:45.076
You're gonna be the boy
who takes out my trash, right?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.330
Now, if I were to set you up,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.333
I got judges
and state troopers owe me favours.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.586
I call them down on you,
and you'd be locked up within an hour.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.588
You don't kill Frank Browning
by the end of the week,

04:57.673 --> 04:58.756
you even try to act smart,

04:58.840 --> 05:02.218
that's how
we're gonna play it, though, right?

05:06.306 --> 05:11.143
What if I were to kill you right now,
right here in this room?

05:11.728 --> 05:15.648
Well, you'd have to watch my friends
destroy everything you love.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.150
Maybe it's worth it.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.988
I don't feel qualified to make that call,
but like I said,

05:22.072 --> 05:25.241
this whole thing is not my line.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.049
Givens, Arlo, here for his trim.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.468
He have a lay-in?

05:44.594 --> 05:45.761
Yeah, he should.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.972
Called him down from Ad Seg this morning.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.641
I don't see nothing in the book.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.101
You sure you got the right time?

05:52.602 --> 05:55.021
I guess maybe someone
forgot to write it down.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.439
You know how that goes.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.444
He always like this?

06:02.946 --> 06:04.613
Good days and bad days.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.782
My grandpa's the same way.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.451
Yeah, you catch him on the right day,

06:08.577 --> 06:10.161
you'd never know nothing's wrong.
Catch him...

06:12.080 --> 06:14.498
Man, you want to
give him another one just to make sure?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.878
Can't remember the last time
I had to sap a guy more than twice.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.798
Jesus, what'd you give him?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.217
Just doubled up what he's already on.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.970
Thorazine, Clorazine, some kind of "zine."

06:28.930 --> 06:31.307
See, this way,
the tox screen won't raise any eyebrows.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.558
Smart. Smart.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.644
Hey, so we got about five minutes
before they notice the cameras are off.

06:35.771 --> 06:36.812
I'm gonna be outside posted up.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.898
Soon at it's over, you knock on that door.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.983
I'm gonna come in hard, pull you off of him,

06:41.109 --> 06:42.318
hit the deuces.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.903
Hey.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.072
You gotta tell this investigator

06:46.156 --> 06:48.240
you slipped in behind me

06:48.325 --> 06:50.159
when I went to the men's room.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.578
All right?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.247
Hey, now...

06:55.999 --> 06:58.334
You know you're looking
at some serious SHU time here?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.462
I mean, supermax, even,
you pull the wrong judge.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.673
Be nice to have some privacy for a while.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.065
Nothing personal, Arlo.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.529
I'll do my best to be quick about it.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.054
Get some!

07:52.514 --> 07:53.931
Get some, yeah!

07:54.349 --> 07:56.475
Get some, yeah! Get some!

07:56.560 --> 07:58.227
Get some!

08:58.330 --> 09:00.289
That's it for this one.

09:06.463 --> 09:09.506
You think I'll ever
get used to having my mail x-rayed?

09:09.633 --> 09:10.799
I sure hope not.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.512
Nineteen possibilities so far.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.766
Is that a lot or a little?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.059
You were married to him.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.102
How can you not remember
what he looks like?

09:22.187 --> 09:24.188
You know how much
people change in 30 years?

09:25.523 --> 09:27.816
Time was, I looked like Ava Gardner.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.613
It's not your bullshit itself that bothers me.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.824
It's that your bullshit makes me think
you're holding something back.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.159
I'm doing my best.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.374
Raylan, come here a minute.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.214
Maybe I could remember his voice.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.840
Maybe his aura.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.552
Perhaps if you waved
your hand over each photo,

09:55.679 --> 09:57.179
one'll give you a vibe.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.684
You still look like Ava Gardner.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.528
Arlo took a shiv to the chest.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.531
They don't think
he's gonna make it through the night.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.701
Have Tim finish up with Eve if you want.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.619
No, I was almost done.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.871
- You sure?
- I got it. Yeah.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.164
I'm sorry.

10:26.501 --> 10:27.668
Thanks.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.256
Is everything okay?

10:36.761 --> 10:38.012
Raylan?

10:38.513 --> 10:39.680
You okay?

10:40.348 --> 10:41.724
Yeah. Fine.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.732
Something happen?

10:52.193 --> 10:55.279
Man who was
gonna make a deal to give up Drew

10:55.405 --> 10:56.739
took a shiv in the chest.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.242
They don't think
he'll make it through the night.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.410
My God.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.122
You have to leave?

11:06.249 --> 11:07.791
Not right away.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.462
Seeing me would just upset him.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.261
Can I get you some sweet tea?

11:20.388 --> 11:21.680
No, thank you, ma'am.

11:21.765 --> 11:22.806
You sure?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.267
Ask nice,
I bet we can get her to put a little Irish in.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.894
Well, I'm fine.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.104
Well, suit yourself.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.066
I'll let you boys get to business.

11:34.736 --> 11:35.986
Have a seat.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.032
Trish is the only reason
those bastards sat still for me

11:40.116 --> 11:41.950
moving up here way back when.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.579
Didn't matter
how many seams that I held leases on.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.749
They always looked at me
like I was cropping a share with my daddy.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.960
But they sure did
want her at their little key parties.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.046
Only reason I'm telling you this

11:54.130 --> 11:57.383
is 'cause I know that you're
engaged to a head-turner yourself.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.761
Want to make sure you're coming up here
with your eyes wide open.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.721
Well, I appreciate the warning, sir,

12:02.806 --> 12:05.808
but your friends' interest in me
got nothing to do with my head-turner.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.101
That's too bad.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.727
Too bad?

12:08.812 --> 12:10.521
Well, these boys' only hobbies

12:10.855 --> 12:12.314
are screwing and spending.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.484
So if they're not using you for your fiancée,

12:16.611 --> 12:19.196
I'd say they've enlisted you
to blow a hole in the wall

12:19.322 --> 12:20.823
of one of my slurry ponds,

12:21.157 --> 12:22.866
cover their land with toxic sludge

12:22.992 --> 12:26.787
so the EPA will come in
and shower them with Superfund money.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.498
Not that either, sir, I'm sad to say.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.793
They didn't send me up here
to release your slurry.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.629
They sent me up here to bury you in it.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.553
They didn't send you here
to tell me about it beforehand.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.971
No, sir.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.305
They did not.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.143
I thought I'd give you
a chance to beat their price.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.814
You want me to pay you not to kill me?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.154
You do much hunting?

13:00.697 --> 13:03.365
I used to with my brother, Bowman.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.618
I haven't felt the urge since he passed.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.412
You know that old quote about

13:09.372 --> 13:10.747
how once you hunt a man

13:10.874 --> 13:12.666
that there's no thrill
in hunting anything else?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.501
It rings a bell.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.211
I don't know that I agree all the way,

13:16.337 --> 13:20.716
but I will allow that there is nothing quite like
stalking something that's stalking you back.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.594
Ain't that right, Deke?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.680
Never really thought about it.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.602
Mr Browning...

13:34.022 --> 13:35.898
I'm gonna say this one more time.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.234
My offer still stands.

13:45.742 --> 13:46.909
Well...

13:48.286 --> 13:50.078
I appreciate that, Boyd.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.123
But, see,
I pride myself on being the kind of man

13:53.249 --> 13:55.250
that'd rather beat you than buy you.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.758
Now you take your bottom-feeding ass
out of here while you're still able.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.052
If you ever come around this house again,

14:05.720 --> 14:08.931
you best be prepared
for me to get inhospitable.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.611
Colt.

14:22.737 --> 14:23.820
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

14:23.947 --> 14:24.988
Baby.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.201
He got a little ornery. Nothing I can't handle.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.452
Ornery?

14:30.578 --> 14:32.329
Well, he's a man
used to having the upper hand.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.456
Took him a little while
to accept his situation.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.999
But he did? He accepted it?

14:36.626 --> 14:38.126
Baby, that's great!

14:38.461 --> 14:41.463
I can't wait to see
the faces on these assholes

14:41.589 --> 14:43.966
when they find out
how quick you got done what they couldn't.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.342
Is Johnny around?

14:45.468 --> 14:48.971
He was. He left about 10 minutes ago,
didn't say where for.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.305
Why?

14:50.431 --> 14:52.599
No reason. I just need a minute. Colton.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.774
And then he wheels out
his big gun, his security detail.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.318
This is now a two-man job.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.407
I feel like the seat cushion
for two fat people at a football game.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.743
So I don't really know what to do from here.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.203
I know I can't do it alone.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.621
I know I'm gonna need you.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.498
And I know I'm gonna need Johnny.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.377
I'm sorry, am I interrupting something?

15:20.503 --> 15:21.837
No, of course not.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.881
You were saying Browning's got backup.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.926
I was saying that
I'm between some awful hard rocks.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.720
And you're busy
passing notes to cheerleaders

15:29.846 --> 15:31.179
during Math class.

15:31.681 --> 15:32.764
Boyd.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.057
Can it wait?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.059
I don't think so.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.423
Wynn Duffy.

16:06.549 --> 16:07.716
I need a word.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.593
Well, why else would you be here?

16:12.055 --> 16:13.930
Go get a drink, Mikey.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.560
Well, why do I all of a sudden feel like
I'm sitting in the principal's office?

16:18.936 --> 16:21.355
Make that the assistant principal's office.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.775
This thing with the guy
getting his foot cut off.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.401
Josiah.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.697
His situation has
further alarmed our friend in Detroit.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.032
His situation?

16:33.409 --> 16:34.910
The feds have him.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.329
Well, so what? He's not Drew Thompson.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.914
But he could have been.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.958
Theo wants Drew found now.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.503
A week ago,
you said you would have him in a week.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.338
Well, things have
gotten a little more complicated.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.090
They certainly have.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.758
Theo's got a guy on his way down

16:49.884 --> 16:52.636
who has apparently
killed more people than malaria.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.556
And it is my understanding,
if we don't find Drew for him

16:56.641 --> 16:59.309
so he can bring his scalp back to Detroit,

16:59.435 --> 17:01.103
he's gonna bring ours instead.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.356
Well, that doesn't seem
like real sound management style.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.775
Threatening to murder loyal employees.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.280
Do you understand?
Theo is ready to scorch the earth down here.

17:13.156 --> 17:16.117
Now, are we gonna have
a name to give this guy, or not?

17:21.124 --> 17:22.790
I've got two names.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.086
That's as far as I've been able to narrow it.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.587
Well, that's great.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.298
Should we just tell him to flip a coin?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.176
I think we should play it safe

17:34.303 --> 17:36.471
and tell him to kill both of them.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.685
Look, Frank.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.646
Just 'cause Crowder says they're moving
against you, that don't make it so.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.856
They want a war?

17:45.982 --> 17:47.983
They want to bury me in my own slurry?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.235
I'll choke that damn pond so full of bodies,

17:50.319 --> 17:52.654
you'll be able to walk across it
without getting your feet wet.

17:52.822 --> 17:53.989
You just need to calm down, all right?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.323
No, don't tell me to calm down!

17:55.491 --> 17:57.033
Tell me how we're gonna win.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.994
The hell else am I paying you for?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.787
You're paying me for my expertise.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.914
You answer the goddamn door.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.008
- Help you?
- Mr Browning?

18:13.509 --> 18:14.593
What, are you serious?

18:14.719 --> 18:16.553
I need to see Mr Browning.

18:16.679 --> 18:17.846
What about?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.223
- Mr Browning.
- That's right.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.185
Frank, how many times
I got to tell you not to...

18:35.740 --> 18:37.532
- Look, I...
- Hold still.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.044
I don't know... I don't know what you...

18:55.092 --> 18:56.218
Yeah.

18:57.595 --> 18:58.720
Yes?

19:01.808 --> 19:05.393
So just to confirm,
the man in the photo is not the correct target.

19:06.437 --> 19:07.562
All right.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.817
Hey, look, I realise that mistakes happen,

19:11.901 --> 19:15.070
and, I mean, trust me,
nobody's gonna miss old Deke here.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.906
Now, I don't know Shelby's game...

19:18.115 --> 19:20.408
I don't know Shelby.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.256
I'm... I'm sorry.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.925
I shouldn't have been poking around.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.638
Saint Christopher.

19:43.266 --> 19:46.434
Patron saint of travellers, sailors, pilots,

19:47.270 --> 19:48.812
and bachelors.

19:51.107 --> 19:54.192
Is that why you have it? The bachelor part.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.821
Well, actually, it belonged to Abby, my wife.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.448
Same as those clothes.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.619
She ain't dead, is she?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.539
Not that I know of.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.040
Good.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.710
Wouldn't feel right wearing
a dead woman's clothes.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.964
So, which one of you did the leaving?

20:18.175 --> 20:19.467
She did.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.512
Packed her bag one day while I was at work,

20:23.222 --> 20:25.390
left a note on top of the TV set.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.352
Going on 25 years ago, must be.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.522
My mama did the same thing.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.151
No note, but...

20:37.820 --> 20:40.071
She did leave dinner for us in the fridge.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.698
How old were you?

20:41.824 --> 20:43.199
I don't know...

20:43.993 --> 20:45.327
Three or so.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.330
Young enough I...

20:48.414 --> 20:50.206
Can't remember what she looks like.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.835
People always told me I favoured her.

20:54.337 --> 20:55.670
Now that you mention it,

20:57.006 --> 20:58.673
you kind of favour Abby some.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.012
It's funny how sometimes
wearing different clothes

21:04.096 --> 21:06.389
makes you feel like a different person.

21:08.225 --> 21:12.520
But sometimes it just makes you feel like
yourself playing dress-up.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.024
Well, must have been

21:16.692 --> 21:20.070
a year after I first joined
the sheriff's department

21:20.196 --> 21:23.698
before I could put on my uniform
without feeling like I was wearing a costume.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.201
Bet you looked awful handsome.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.542
Do you think that...

21:37.088 --> 21:39.381
That I could ever be the kind of woman

21:40.216 --> 21:42.092
who belongs in these clothes?

21:43.761 --> 21:45.720
And walk into church

21:46.055 --> 21:48.473
and not have people say,

21:48.557 --> 21:51.893
"Now, ain't that sweet?
The whore's come to get saved?"

21:52.895 --> 21:54.062
I think...

21:55.398 --> 21:58.608
If you pretend to be something long enough,

21:59.276 --> 22:00.735
it's not pretending.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.617
I guess my first step
would be to get right with the Lord.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.162
'Cause of how you made your living?

22:12.581 --> 22:13.915
Oh, not just that.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.959
What else?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.003
Something to do with Ava Crowder?

22:20.673 --> 22:22.173
Something you saw her do?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.304
Something you did together?

22:35.980 --> 22:37.105
Yeah, this is Shelby.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.274
God damn.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.902
Hey.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.113
I just sold you a bundle two days ago,

22:45.197 --> 22:47.490
and you're here for another.
You're gonna be dead in a week.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.452
Come on in.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.746
Take your clothes off.
Make yourself at home.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.623
Remember when I bought that last bundle?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.876
You asked me to strip then, too.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.794
- You remember what I said?
- Yeah.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.964
Well, this time,
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.383
Do you remember what I said?

23:05.468 --> 23:08.595
Yeah, you said I could either
let you in and make myself some cash,

23:08.679 --> 23:12.098
or continue disrespecting you
and open myself up to a world of shit.

23:13.476 --> 23:15.977
Well, I want you
to remember what I got right here.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.104
Okay.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.689
What can I get you? Same as before?

23:19.815 --> 23:20.899
No.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.650
I need a loan.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.235
A loan?

23:24.487 --> 23:25.987
Yeah.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.073
I need 20 grand.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.075
20.

23:30.159 --> 23:34.412
Well, how you want it,
hundreds or tens, fives?

23:35.247 --> 23:36.581
I mean, I could give you singles

23:36.665 --> 23:38.666
if the plan is
to make it rain at the Lobster Box.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.259
All right.

23:48.511 --> 23:52.680
How come you're not afraid
of blowing your nuts off, huh?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.433
Is that 'cause you keep the safety on,

23:55.518 --> 23:58.186
or that you keep
the chamber empty, or both?

24:02.942 --> 24:05.401
Come on. Please, man. Please.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.911
I ought to make you strip.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.942
You stupid bastard.

25:13.679 --> 25:14.804
Hello.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.685
I didn't see anything. I didn't hear anything.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.979
I swear it's the last time
I'm gonna use, please.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.481
Open your eyes.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.359
I don't want to see your face.

25:28.611 --> 25:29.944
You already saw my face.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.946
You were watching me when I walked in.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.783
Open your eyes.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.457
I know you.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.001
I've never seen you before.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.170
We met at the VA.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.130
You were with that marshal.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.051
Oh, yeah. Right.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.220
What's your name?

25:56.805 --> 25:57.805
Mark.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.433
Hey, Mark.

26:00.517 --> 26:01.684
I'm Colt.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.186
Want one?

26:04.063 --> 26:05.188
Sure. Okay.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.159
We are in the shit, Mark.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.994
I don't know what to do.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.455
Someone's trying to run a game on me,

26:22.539 --> 26:26.000
and I don't know who it is exactly,
but I know it's not that girl.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.503
At least not by herself.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.964
Man, that's your business.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.757
It's your business, too, Mark.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.801
I mean, we're here, right?

26:36.011 --> 26:38.972
You have any family, huh?
You married, do you have kids, anything?

26:41.392 --> 26:43.059
Figured I best get clean first.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.645
That's smart.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.397
I should do that, too.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.906
So here's the deal, Mark.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.582
It's gonna be like I was never here, right?

27:09.878 --> 27:11.337
Like this never happened.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.551
Copy that.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.355
All right.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.369
You're not gonna say anything, huh?

27:44.079 --> 27:46.748
Just lie there and wait me out.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.503
Doc says you've been in and out

27:52.588 --> 27:54.797
and there's a chance
you'd sleep all the time I was here,

27:54.923 --> 27:57.884
but we both know
you're too mean to go that easy,

27:58.093 --> 27:59.093
so come on.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.471
Give me something.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.104
I ain't asking for an apology.

28:10.606 --> 28:14.484
Hell, that'd take too long,
and I don't want any fatherly advice.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.737
Figure if you had any worth giving,

28:17.821 --> 28:20.281
you wouldn't be
circling the drain in a prison infirmary.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.283
Just...

28:24.495 --> 28:25.912
Give me something.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.417
Who's Drew Thompson?

28:34.630 --> 28:36.964
Not for me. For your grandkids.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.093
They can grow up
with a chief deputy for a daddy,

28:40.177 --> 28:44.263
hear stories about their granddaddy
who wasn't just a son of a bitch.

28:56.527 --> 28:57.860
All right, Arlo.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.613
This is your last last chance.

29:05.661 --> 29:06.953
Don't go.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.542
Closer.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.799
Kiss my ass.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.446
You're not ticklish, are you, huh?
You're ticklish?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.072
Give me that hand.

29:44.241 --> 29:47.577
Yeah. Nice and tight.

29:48.745 --> 29:49.787
Nice and tight.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.582
Yeah.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.792
Oh, shit. Is that your wife?

29:56.211 --> 30:00.339
If it were my wife,
the worst thing she would do

30:00.424 --> 30:02.091
is ask to join in.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.220
But my wife, she don't ring the bell.

30:08.724 --> 30:09.974
That makes sense.

30:12.269 --> 30:13.603
Yeah, it does.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.453
Officer, what can I do for you?

30:31.330 --> 30:32.747
- Mr Keener.
- Yes, sir.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.250
Hold still, please.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.002
- Excuse me?
- Just...

30:42.090 --> 30:43.799
Is there a problem, officer?

30:48.263 --> 30:49.263
Yeah.

30:52.935 --> 30:54.018
All right, then.

31:23.632 --> 31:28.469
So, not half a day after
you asked me to look into a list of names,

31:28.804 --> 31:31.138
one of the men on that list turns up dead.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.058
Can I assume that's not a coincidence?

31:34.810 --> 31:36.727
I try not to assume anything,

31:36.812 --> 31:40.231
but I'll allow if it is a coincidence,
it's a hell of a one.

31:40.315 --> 31:44.318
Except that now,
I got a second stiff who's not on your list

31:44.695 --> 31:46.654
and was killed the same way as the first.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.656
Close-range hollow-point,

31:48.991 --> 31:50.992
head shot after he hits the ground.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.412
And it would be
hell's own shakes of a coincidence

31:54.496 --> 31:56.372
if he wasn't killed by the same man.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.166
So I guess the question here is,

31:59.668 --> 32:02.670
which one of those coincidences
is just a coincidence?

32:04.339 --> 32:05.506
What's the list?

32:07.175 --> 32:10.219
Drew Thompson's widow...
Or former widow, whatever she is.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.096
Had her go through DMV photos,

32:12.180 --> 32:14.765
put aside any guys
that could be her dearly departed,

32:14.850 --> 32:15.891
plus 30 years.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.185
You never said anything about the widow.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.690
Seeing as that you're only
interested in enforcing the law

32:22.858 --> 32:25.318
and under no circumstances
are you helping Boyd

32:25.402 --> 32:26.611
stay ahead of my investigation,

32:26.695 --> 32:28.529
I don't see why you'd much care.

32:28.739 --> 32:32.116
Boyd's doing just fine staying ahead of
you without any help from me.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.534
What's that mean?

32:33.869 --> 32:35.536
Browning's wife...

32:36.246 --> 32:38.539
Or widow, I guess she is now.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.876
She said that Boyd
came to see him this morning

32:42.127 --> 32:45.713
a good three, four hours
before you called me with your list.

32:46.256 --> 32:49.050
What about this fella?
His widow say anything about Boyd coming?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.468
Well, that ain't his widow.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.890
Hey, where you been?
You missed all the excitement.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.725
I had some personal business.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.895
Plus, apparently,
my cousin has decided to start World War III.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.397
What are you talking about?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.358
Well, you missed all the sirens,

33:05.442 --> 33:07.943
'cause Boyd's dropped
three bodies in the last few hours.

33:09.237 --> 33:10.321
Boyd hasn't dropped anybody.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.324
What?

33:13.408 --> 33:15.242
Are you saying that you killed those men?

33:16.078 --> 33:17.119
Why?

33:17.913 --> 33:19.914
'Cause one of them was Drew Thompson.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.291
According to who?

33:23.251 --> 33:24.418
Boyd?

33:27.130 --> 33:29.548
Only one of them even could have been,
and that would've been Browning,

33:29.633 --> 33:31.092
but that'd be a hell of a coincidence.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.593
How so?

33:32.678 --> 33:34.512
Well, there's been
a bunch of men wanting Boyd to kill him

33:34.596 --> 33:35.805
over some land deal.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.682
Then it was the other one. That Sam guy.

33:38.642 --> 33:42.353
Sam Keener was an old
drinking buddy of my Uncle Owen's

33:42.437 --> 33:44.605
way back in the day before I was even born.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.650
That would've been
10, 12 years before Drew even got here.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.865
So you're telling me that...

33:58.286 --> 34:00.329
That Boyd just handed me his enemies list?

34:02.999 --> 34:04.542
I'm just telling you what I know.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.465
Mr Crowder,
I have some good news and some bad news.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.635
The good news is
you're about to get your wish

34:14.719 --> 34:18.639
as far as having
your cousin shuffled off this mortal coil.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.350
The bad news?

34:22.351 --> 34:25.353
That makes you the man
who's going to bring me Drew Thompson

34:25.688 --> 34:26.897
or die trying.

34:29.693 --> 34:32.652
And remember, you wanted this.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.286
I should've known.

34:41.371 --> 34:42.413
Should've known what?

34:42.496 --> 34:45.331
Raylan Givens,
if you were coming down here anyway,

34:45.417 --> 34:47.877
why have Shelby drag me in again?

34:48.587 --> 34:51.338
I didn't have him drag you in the first time.
What's going on?

34:51.672 --> 34:53.132
What's it look like?

34:53.216 --> 34:54.675
Did Shelby send you?

34:54.842 --> 34:56.510
Well, he's the boss, isn't he?

34:57.679 --> 34:59.430
I just saw him not 15 minutes ago.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.015
He didn't mention anything.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.934
Well, maybe he figured
it wasn't any of your concern.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.353
Well, except I told him I was coming here.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.564
I'm sorry.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.734
We haven't met.
I'm deputy US Marshal, Raylan Givens.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.236
- All due respect...
- Okay, just hold up.

35:14.571 --> 35:15.946
Is that an engagement ring?

35:16.031 --> 35:18.365
That's a big rock, ain't it?

35:18.700 --> 35:21.243
Now, as acrimonious
as our relationship has been lately, Raylan,

35:21.369 --> 35:24.038
Ava and I discussed it,
and you're still gonna be on the guest list.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.707
You know the definition of crazy, right?

35:26.875 --> 35:30.544
Keep doing the same thing over and over
and expecting it to come out different.

35:30.879 --> 35:31.962
Sir?

35:32.547 --> 35:34.256
I'm gonna need you to step aside.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.217
Okay, maybe I'm crazy,

35:36.551 --> 35:38.135
or I'm just having a hell of a day.

35:38.220 --> 35:39.762
Did you just give me an order?

35:41.890 --> 35:44.391
You don't move, I'm gonna shoot you.

35:51.733 --> 35:54.068
Jesus, I hope I got that right.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.142
Well, I don't recognise this number.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.896
But there ain't but a few people
that'd be calling me from this area code.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.357
My name is Nick Augustine.
I speak for a man named Theo Tonin.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.276
I understand you've been trying to reach us.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.569
You have 30 seconds.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.404
Well, now, that's not very long.

37:20.822 --> 37:23.157
It is, considering
the trouble you've given us lately.

37:23.366 --> 37:26.160
Well, if you mean by not dying at the
hands of your button man,

37:26.244 --> 37:28.370
hopefully you'll understand
if I don't apologise.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.165
You gave that same button man
two wrong targets.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.875
Well, now, to be fair, Mr...

37:33.001 --> 37:34.251
I'm sorry. What was your name?

37:34.336 --> 37:35.836
Augustine. Twenty seconds.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.254
Well, now, to be fair, Mr Augustine,

37:37.339 --> 37:38.839
I didn't give him those names.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.633
You gave them to Duffy.

37:40.717 --> 37:43.427
Which begs the question,
now, why would you want

37:43.511 --> 37:46.263
to back a man who got took
when you can back the man who took him?

37:46.348 --> 37:47.932
Now, how am I doing on time?

37:48.558 --> 37:50.100
Go ahead.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.645
Now, it seems to me,
Mr Augustine, you're desperately in need

37:52.729 --> 37:55.314
of a man down here
who knows the lay of the land.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.524
A man who will not only
bring you Drew Thompson,

37:57.859 --> 37:59.443
but who will also continue to make sure

37:59.527 --> 38:01.946
that your Kentucky endeavours
run smoothly long after this

38:02.030 --> 38:04.406
unfortunate series of events have passed.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.367
And you want to be that man?

38:06.701 --> 38:07.993
Yes, sir. I do.

38:08.078 --> 38:10.204
Call me at this number when you have Drew,

38:10.914 --> 38:12.289
and we'll discuss your future.

38:12.374 --> 38:14.917
Well, actually, Mr Augustine,

38:15.377 --> 38:17.920
there is something
I'm gonna need from you before that.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.298
We don't do favours, Mr Crowder.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.927
Anything we give you now will be a debt

38:25.053 --> 38:26.720
we expect you to repay.

38:27.097 --> 38:29.056
Can I assume
you understand what that means?

38:29.391 --> 38:31.892
Yes, Mr Augustine. I believe I do.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.110
I believe you're in the clear.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.903
That's a load off.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.405
Raylan, I just want you to know

38:44.489 --> 38:46.740
I was almost certain you weren't a cop killer.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.283
Almost.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.079
Any idea where he got that uniform?

38:52.163 --> 38:54.748
We figure he stole it from a dry cleaners.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.417
Any idea who he was?

38:56.960 --> 39:00.212
No ID yet,
but five'll get you 10 he's out of Detroit.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.089
Whole lot more where he came from.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.801
Only question is,
does Theo have that many more targets?

39:05.927 --> 39:08.429
He will when he realises Drew's still missing.

39:09.431 --> 39:11.098
What about Browning? Could he be Drew?

39:11.182 --> 39:12.516
I know he was on Eve's list.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.101
His prints match his army records.

39:14.269 --> 39:17.271
He's been Frank Browning
at least since 1972.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.440
And Eve's the widow, right?

39:20.817 --> 39:22.026
She really psychic?

39:22.819 --> 39:24.319
Opinions abound.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.655
How big is Eve's list?

39:27.282 --> 39:28.449
27.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.951
26, now that we've crossed off Browning.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.661
That's a lot of people.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.621
Take a lot of manpower to cover that many.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.999
And we don't even know
if she just picked out guys

39:37.125 --> 39:38.834
that looked the least like Drew.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.462
Well, I thought
we were covered in bullshit before.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.298
Well, if you're looking to add to your list,

39:44.632 --> 39:48.135
you might start with
the other guys Boyd's been seen with lately.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.512
Couple of Clover Hill swells.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.891
Lee Paxton and Gerald Johns.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.476
Think one of them could be Drew?

39:55.643 --> 39:57.144
I think Boyd thinks so.

39:57.479 --> 40:00.064
Can't figure any other reason
he'd be cosying up to them.

40:00.148 --> 40:01.565
Do you mind keeping eyes on them

40:01.649 --> 40:03.859
while we try to get our
shit together around here?

40:04.194 --> 40:05.402
Be my pleasure.

40:05.487 --> 40:07.154
I wouldn't mind putting eyes on the widow.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.989
From what Raylan says,
she's something to look at.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.869
Well, she's at the motel
with her security detail,

40:13.995 --> 40:15.996
so I wouldn't go
peeking in the windows if I was you.

40:16.581 --> 40:19.041
Why do the
pretty ones always go for the bad boys?

40:20.001 --> 40:21.877
I ask myself that every day.

40:22.462 --> 40:25.130
I guess they think
they can change us, right, Raylan?

40:25.715 --> 40:27.591
I still don't entirely trust him.

40:28.718 --> 40:31.512
You know, maybe we should
just go at Boyd directly

40:31.638 --> 40:34.348
now that it seems that
he and Theo have had a falling out.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.893
Only thing we know for sure is
he's Theo's only loose end.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.771
Well, him and your daddy, at least for now.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.606
Arlo's dead.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.942
Got the call an hour ago.

40:49.239 --> 40:50.364
What?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.032
You okay?

40:53.535 --> 40:54.660
Yeah.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.913
- You sure?
- Art, I'm fine.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.458
Can we get back to the case?

41:01.751 --> 41:03.794
Yeah, we can, but you're going home.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.546
- What?
- You're taking the week.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.548
- Bullshit.
- No debate about this, Raylan.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.174
Rachel, Tim, come in my office.

41:09.259 --> 41:10.884
Art, I brought you this case.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.970
Raylan, this is a US Marshal Service case.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.639
I pulled it out of the wall
of my goddamn house.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.224
Well, nobody's taking it away from you.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.560
- Clearly.
- Let us carry the ball for a while.

41:19.853 --> 41:22.062
We'll make sure
you're there when we take him down.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.481
Yeah, what do you care
if we drive the ball into field-goal range,

41:24.566 --> 41:26.233
just as long as
you're there to kick it through?

41:26.317 --> 41:27.359
Okay.

41:27.694 --> 41:28.944
- Do me a favour.
- Yeah.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.029
Don't say shit unless you
know for sure it helps.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.739
- Raylan...
- Art, look at my desk.

41:33.408 --> 41:34.908
You see any photos of the man?

41:36.286 --> 41:37.870
So what are we talking about?

41:38.121 --> 41:39.663
We're just talking about a case,

41:39.747 --> 41:42.499
a big case that
I'm sure you'd love to retire on.

41:42.876 --> 41:45.085
And who's got
a better chance of catching him than me?

41:51.759 --> 41:53.552
- I'll take a day.
- You'll take a few days.

41:53.636 --> 41:54.761
I'll take two days.

41:55.054 --> 41:56.763
Go down to Tramble
in the morning, claim the body,

41:56.848 --> 41:58.473
I'll be back here the day after.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.396
I'll see you the day after tomorrow.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.815
But if you do one thing that I don't like,

42:06.983 --> 42:08.108
I will pull your ass.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.443
- See you then.
- You hear me?

42:47.649 --> 42:50.484
Gentlemen, my apologies
for making you wait.

42:50.652 --> 42:52.986
Appears I wasn't
clear enough when last we spoke.

42:53.613 --> 42:55.656
You don't call us to meetings. We call you.

42:55.865 --> 42:58.325
Well, in that case,
I appreciate you making the exception.

42:58.660 --> 43:01.411
We felt the job you did
on Browning yesterday

43:01.496 --> 43:03.789
warranted a one-time magnanimity.

43:04.666 --> 43:07.834
Just don't go thinking
it makes you the man that killed Jesse James.

43:07.919 --> 43:08.961
No.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.213
Can I offer
you gentlemen something to drink?

43:12.507 --> 43:14.466
Boyd, it's 10:30 in the morning.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.009
Well, it seems to me you're the kind of men

43:16.094 --> 43:20.180
who don't feel bound and conformed to
the conventions of normal social behaviour.

43:22.308 --> 43:23.392
Where the hell is Sam?

43:23.476 --> 43:25.143
Have you called him here?

43:25.228 --> 43:27.271
Well, that would be a real trick, wouldn't it?

43:28.106 --> 43:29.314
What does that mean?

43:29.399 --> 43:32.150
Well, I don't suppose
you gentlemen saw the news this morning.

43:33.653 --> 43:36.029
Someone shot Sam Keener dead.

43:37.657 --> 43:41.702
Police think it might have been the same fella
who killed Frank Browning.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.206
You piece of white trash.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.293
I want to personally make sure

43:49.377 --> 43:51.461
that you don't live
to see Sam put in the ground.

43:51.546 --> 43:52.754
By doing what?

43:53.172 --> 43:54.881
Siccing all your staties on me,

43:55.425 --> 43:57.884
all them judges you tell how high to jump?

43:59.095 --> 44:00.554
Why don't you call them?

44:00.763 --> 44:02.222
Really, we got time.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.322
We're sorry. You have reached a number

44:18.406 --> 44:20.949
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

44:21.451 --> 44:22.868
If you feel you have reached this...

44:30.877 --> 44:32.210
They didn't pick up?

44:33.087 --> 44:35.005
Oh, they ain't never gonna pick up.

44:35.715 --> 44:38.633
See, I had a very
powerful man I know put the word out

44:38.843 --> 44:41.345
that continued relationships
with the three of you

44:41.429 --> 44:42.971
would not be in their best interest.

44:44.098 --> 44:46.433
Turns out fear is a powerful motivator,

44:47.018 --> 44:48.977
even more powerful than greed.

44:52.023 --> 44:54.566
Sit your white-collar ass down!

45:03.242 --> 45:06.495
Now, I know people like you
are used to taking from people like me.

45:07.246 --> 45:12.250
But there comes a point when people
like me can't take any more taking.

45:13.378 --> 45:14.878
Now, all the things you've done,

45:15.671 --> 45:18.715
the way you built your fortunes,
it might make you criminals,

45:19.175 --> 45:21.426
but it don't make you outlaws.

45:22.261 --> 45:25.055
I am the outlaw.

45:25.139 --> 45:28.141
And this is my world.

45:30.019 --> 45:32.145
And my world has a high cost of living.

45:33.147 --> 45:34.398
How much do you want?

45:34.899 --> 45:36.400
- A hundred.
- Thousand?

45:36.609 --> 45:37.692
Each.

45:38.736 --> 45:42.364
Oh, and I want
you to help me get a Dairy Queen franchise.

45:48.454 --> 45:49.496
Cousin Johnny.

45:53.418 --> 45:54.584
All right.

45:55.461 --> 45:56.795
You gentlemen like ice cream?

45:59.966 --> 46:01.425
I love a Peanut Buster Parfait.

46:02.677 --> 46:03.885
But Dairy Queen?

46:03.970 --> 46:06.012
Dairy Queens are like California real estate.

46:06.347 --> 46:07.722
Value may dip every now and then,

46:07.807 --> 46:10.684
but it always goes back up
in the summertime.

46:13.688 --> 46:14.729
This is it, baby.

46:15.064 --> 46:16.314
This is going legit.

46:16.649 --> 46:19.818
This is how we see
to it our grandkids grow up bona fide.

46:19.902 --> 46:20.944
Three generations?

46:21.028 --> 46:22.529
Three generations. That's right.

46:23.656 --> 46:27.742
Boyd, you think we're gonna be alive
to see three generations down the road?

46:27.827 --> 46:29.161
What's that supposed to mean?

46:30.997 --> 46:33.832
Yesterday, you got trouble
from those assholes.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.750
You got trouble from Duffy.

46:36.002 --> 46:38.211
You get Theo Tonin to make one phone call,

46:38.296 --> 46:39.921
and all those troubles just
magically disappear.

46:40.006 --> 46:42.674
Nothing backs down
a bully like a bigger, meaner bully.

46:42.758 --> 46:43.800
Right.

46:43.885 --> 46:46.720
But what happens
when you get trouble from Theo?

46:47.513 --> 46:48.972
Who you gonna call to back him down?

46:52.435 --> 46:54.144
Is there anybody bigger than Theo?

46:54.645 --> 46:56.354
Just God and Uncle Sam.

46:56.689 --> 46:58.857
- Jesus, Boyd.
- Baby, baby.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.693
Like I said, it's nothing I can't handle.

47:03.362 --> 47:06.490
Don't lose faith now. We're so close.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.284
This is our time.

47:13.164 --> 47:15.373
Let's break through that glass ceiling.
