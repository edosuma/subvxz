WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:08.242
You should be careful,
Ms. Dewell.

00:08.276 --> 00:10.244
They are watching.

00:10.278 --> 00:13.347
You...me...
everything.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.582
You tell them
why you were here?

00:14.615 --> 00:16.084
Yeah.
Following up on Ronald.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.052
We did a little search
before they got here.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.220
I can't see that.
Look at it.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.756
Make a wish
and throw it.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.558
Well, I wish something
would happen in this town.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.832
Holy crap.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.370
Guys, let's get out of here,
like, right now.
No.
We have to help him!

00:36.404 --> 00:38.172
Somebody's coming!
Get down!

00:38.206 --> 00:39.740
Get the bags
and get out.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.743
They'll kill you.
Get the bags and get out. Now.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.420
Guys.
Check this out.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.074
Good morning, Ronald.

01:14.108 --> 01:17.478
My name is
Wolfgang Legarski.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.413
You can call me Wolf --
short for Wolfgang.

01:19.447 --> 01:23.317
As in Mozart, Van Halen,
Blitzer.

01:25.119 --> 01:26.587
Did Rick ever tell you
about me?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.156
Yes.

01:28.189 --> 01:33.127
He said that you were
a weak, degenerate hippie.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.431
Big Rick.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.433
What a shame.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.935
He was given so much, and yet,
he achieved so little.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.772
Rick was sloppy
and incompetent.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.274
He was my friend.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.611
My brother didn't have
any friends.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.946
Well, he helped me,
or he tried to,

01:52.980 --> 01:55.649
but my urges sometimes got
the better of me.

01:55.683 --> 01:59.320
No, Ronald,
he <i>used</i> you.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.422
See, I have
a unique perspective into

02:01.455 --> 02:02.923
what my brother
was capable of,

02:02.956 --> 02:05.693
and it is
my mission in life now

02:05.726 --> 02:09.697
to undo all the evil
that he unleashed on the world,

02:09.730 --> 02:12.032
and that starts with you.

02:12.065 --> 02:15.102
I am here to help you,
Ronald,

02:15.135 --> 02:18.406
to master those urges.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.542
Where is Scarlet?

02:21.575 --> 02:24.612
I want to see her now.

02:24.645 --> 02:29.049
Seeing Scarlet is a privilege
that you have not yet earned.

02:31.018 --> 02:33.321
Now, let's get something
straight --

02:33.354 --> 02:35.689
I am the alpha here,

02:35.723 --> 02:41.094
which means you will have
nothing unless I give it to you.

02:43.163 --> 02:47.901
Now, I have made you
something to eat.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.371
I'll bet you
you're a hungry young lad.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.875
Now, before
you have breakfast,

02:54.908 --> 02:57.511
I need you to
ask permission.

03:03.684 --> 03:07.288
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.025
For each action,

03:12.059 --> 03:14.362
there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.264
These are the laws of nature,
Ronald.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.433
And that
was a warning poke.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.870
Now, put the bacon down

03:22.903 --> 03:24.538
and ask permission.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.078
Ah!

03:38.118 --> 03:39.287
Bad dog.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.948
No sign of the driver.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.117
Could be some drunk rolled it
and ran off.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.385
We'll find him.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.253
A drunk who scratched off
the VIN?

04:13.287 --> 04:14.455
Huh.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.410
Blood.
Hoo boy.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.011
Call a tow.
Get this into the shop.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.789
Mom and Dad at work?

04:48.822 --> 04:50.991
Yeah.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.126
There's nothing about
the accident.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.863
That's good, I think.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.030
Yeah.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.835
Listen, I was thinking about
going back down there.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.871
No.
No, don't do that.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.606
We sit tight.
That's the plan, remember?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.207
I know, Madison.
But --

05:07.240 --> 05:08.442
But what?

05:08.476 --> 05:10.143
That man killed someone.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.213
What if he saw us?

05:13.246 --> 05:14.482
He didn't, Bridger.
Or anybody.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.716
I mean,
people camp up there.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.385
No.
Nobody saw us.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.820
So, please,
just try to relax, okay?

05:19.853 --> 05:21.422
Be cool for once
in your life.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.558
Yeah.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.545
Hey. Wait.
Aren't you still suspended?

05:44.578 --> 05:46.013
It's up in two days.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.381
Psych eval,
and then I'm good to go.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.916
Ooh, careful with
those psych evals.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.418
You never know
what they might find.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.021
Nothing I don't
already know about.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.656
We still on?
Ready when you are.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.357
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.660
Where are we going?
Gun shopping.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.562
Oh, I'm a Glock gal.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.731
Do not let them talk you into
a wheel gun.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.499
I already got my eye
on something.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.068
Hey.
You got a minute?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.737
Yeah. Sure.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.443
What's up?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.411
Anything on Dewey?

06:17.445 --> 06:20.914
Oh, uh, I can't get a look at
that file till I'm reinstated.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.450
Plus,
local state investigators

06:22.483 --> 06:24.752
are circling the wagon,
so...

06:24.785 --> 06:27.054
You okay?

06:28.889 --> 06:31.525
No.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.761
He had a picture of Kai.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.296
That's my fault.
How so?

06:36.329 --> 06:39.467
By chasing Ronald,
I made my own son a target.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.901
Cassie, you can't think
like that.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.737
Assuming Dewey
was working with Ronald,

06:43.771 --> 06:45.138
it's the most likely
thing.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.574
I don't accept that.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.075
This is way bigger
than them.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.409
It doesn't change
what the photo means.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.644
You know that.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.113
Look, we have to proceed
carefully.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.648
Now,
I say we circle back.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.916
We start again.
We dig into Legarski --

06:55.949 --> 06:57.985
I can't.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.787
I have to protect
my family.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.626
Okay.

07:08.328 --> 07:12.099
You keep at it,
and if you have anything real,

07:12.132 --> 07:14.367
let me know,
but I can't...

07:18.506 --> 07:19.740
Right.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.952
Road's closed.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.157
You following me?

07:37.190 --> 07:40.260
No, I'm on my way to work.
I got a graveyard shift.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.162
What's this?

07:42.195 --> 07:44.197
Truck went off the road.

07:44.231 --> 07:47.801
Seems like a lot of fuss
for a -- an accident.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.704
Come on. What do you got,
a drunk driver?

07:50.738 --> 07:52.606
I don't think so.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.175
I got blood,
no bodies.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.044
You know what you got?

07:58.912 --> 08:01.214
You got yourself
a mystery.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.716
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.284
Hey, you know,
I was wondering something.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.554
You think that I could get you
to let me through,

08:06.587 --> 08:08.421
'cause I'm gonna be late
for work.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.728
You wouldn't want that.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.130
Let him through!

08:35.583 --> 08:38.552
Howdy.
Welcome to Montana.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.387
Where you comin' from?

08:40.420 --> 08:42.089
None of your business.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.724
Just being friendly.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.258
Lemme get that for you.
I'm good.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.694
Really.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.865
I like your hat.
How much for it?

08:51.899 --> 08:54.568
It's not for sale, ma'am.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.571
Where I come from,
everything has a price.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.406
Well, not my hat.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.680
Hey.
Hey, Missy.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.015
Here we go.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.282
Be nice, Donno.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.754
I don't want no trouble.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.222
Y'all have a nice day.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.591
You can keep the hat.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.894
So nice.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.202
I see why they call it
Big Sky.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.772
It's like an ocean.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.440
It's a whole vibe.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.808
I'm gonna need some tools.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.243
Yeah, can we just put
a pause on

09:36.276 --> 09:38.045
cutting people up this time,
Donno?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.748
Let's just follow our money,
see where it takes us.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.383
First, we gotta do something
about that outfit.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.285
Keys.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.720
You ride bitch.

09:46.754 --> 09:47.955
Okay.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.105
You know,
the original proverb used to be,

10:38.138 --> 10:40.207
"One bad apple spoils
the whole barrel."

10:40.240 --> 10:42.943
Yeah. Thing is, no one buys
fruit by the barrel anymore.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.979
If you're looking for
the library, kid,

10:46.013 --> 10:47.214
it's across the street.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.682
Li--
Your future awaits.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.851
Uh, no, I'm -- I'm here to
report a crime.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.722
You got this?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.356
No can do.
I'm on break.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.294
Sign in.
Have a seat.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.430
I will grab someone.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.094
Something wrong, kid?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.530
Wh-- Uh, no.
No. I'm good.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.966
Really.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.251
Hey, newbie,
you got one.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.587
There's a kid up front.
He wants to report a crime.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.755
What kind of crime?

12:01.789 --> 12:04.557
I don't know.
I didn't ask.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.733
Ugh. You guys gotta work
on your coffee.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.435
Oh, tell me about it.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.475
Harvey?
Yeah.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.245
I was told there was a kid here
who wanted to report a crime.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.247
He didn't say
anything to me.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.982
I guess he must've
changed his mind.

Yes, we can.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.274
That is so great,
and I so don't believe you.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.742
Oh. Nice.
Huh.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.044
Hmm. It --

14:37.077 --> 14:38.545
Real nice.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.150
Hi.
I'm Cassie Dewell.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.620
I'm gonna be honest.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.723
When I came in here, I was
expecting someone different.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.559
Oh,
what were you expecting?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.894
Well, I-I heard about you
shooting that Trooper.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.863
It was, um...

14:56.896 --> 14:58.065
kinda badass.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.766
I don't know about that,

14:59.799 --> 15:01.935
but I'll take it as
a compliment.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.736
What can I do for you,
Tonya?

15:03.770 --> 15:04.771
How did you know
my name?

15:04.804 --> 15:06.073
Your name tag.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.442
Right.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.778
I've never done this before.
How does this work?

15:11.811 --> 15:13.713
Oh, well, you just -- you just
tell me what you're looking for,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.415
and I will let you know
if I can help.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.551
My boyfriend is missing.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.087
Does your boyfriend
have a name?

15:20.120 --> 15:23.123
Uh, Sam Teske, but everyone
calls him Big Sam.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.791
He didn't come home
the other night.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.327
He was on his way to pick me up,
and just, poof.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.962
Doesn't show.
Doesn't call.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.164
He's not answering
any of my texts.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.600
Has this ever happened
before?

15:33.633 --> 15:34.934
No.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.305
I'm worried something bad
happened to him.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.008
I can help.
I'll grab you some paperwork.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.809
You fill it out,
pay the retainer,

15:42.842 --> 15:44.777
and I'll get started.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.613
Thank you.
Yeah.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.530
I'd advise against
your plan.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.066
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.670
The next one'll be harder.

16:17.877 --> 16:22.715
It'll go easier if you accept
your position in the pack.

16:22.749 --> 16:26.719
Right now,
you are not in the pack.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.056
You are less than a dog.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.358
What if I don't want to be
in your pack?

16:31.391 --> 16:34.661
Then you don't deserve
to live.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.547
Said he was self-employed.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.849
Hmm.
So, he just vanished.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.518
I tried to get
his last location off his phone,

19:11.551 --> 19:13.553

Hey, Ms. D.
Hi, Max.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.730
Uh, I was around the corner
when I got your message,

19:23.763 --> 19:25.298
so I figured I'd stop by.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.733
What's up?

19:26.766 --> 19:29.068
Um, I was wondering if
you could work on Tuesday.

just see how school's
going for him, and...

19:43.082 --> 19:45.051
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

19:45.084 --> 19:48.054
Yeah, I think he's --
think he's more comfortable

these days.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.564

20:00.800 --> 20:02.402
No.

20:02.435 --> 20:06.038

He's missing.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.774
Uh

20:07.807 --> 20:11.244
Cool. I mean, um,
that's too bad.

No.
Enjoy her from here.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.910

20:58.825 --> 21:01.794

women working in gardens.

Really gets me going.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.637
See?

21:10.670 --> 21:12.572
He's okay.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.007

She is a creature
so full of light.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.367

21:40.400 --> 21:42.669
still a little bit
of good in you

if you're a lightweight.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.828
Man, I keep thinking about
Ronald and Scarlet.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.563

talk about work?

22:10.597 --> 22:12.565

25:31.297 --> 25:34.066

25:34.100 --> 25:36.402

25:38.404 --> 25:39.906
and no one comes to look
for it,

25:39.939 --> 25:45.444
then we can divide the rest
and do whatever we want.

What are we gonna do with those?

25:49.281 --> 25:51.751

25:51.784 --> 25:53.586
Yeah, I'm, like,
totally not down with that

but I hear you.

25:55.421 --> 25:57.223
I do.
We get rid of them.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.558
That way, all we have to worry
about is the money.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.393

26:16.442 --> 26:18.110
Shwank.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.146
Your brother is
an idiot.
You think?

26:25.584 --> 26:29.088
That was really cool what you
did for your mom, by the way.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.123
Thanks.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.259
Do you wanna come to
my house?

26:33.292 --> 26:37.563
We can make a TikTok,
and I want to show you
something in my room.

I saw you! Hey!

26:55.281 --> 26:57.183
Leave us alone, creep!

26:57.216 --> 26:58.685
Ugh!

26:59.786 --> 27:01.187
Come on! Let's go!

27:48.768 --> 27:51.237
How many years your
brother been working for me?

27:51.270 --> 27:54.874
Oh, really?

27:54.907 --> 27:58.077
Oh, yeah? Been quite a while,
don't you think?

27:58.110 --> 28:01.213
Ah, yeah, but let's not
talk about him.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.216
Come here.

28:04.250 --> 28:05.484
Now, wait.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.254
He's been working there
12 years.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.723
Now you want to follow me?

28:10.757 --> 28:11.924
Come on.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.664
Like I said,
I cleaned it all up --

28:18.697 --> 28:21.167
Ringo, Big Sam,
'cause I'm thorough like that.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.434
Where's the truck?

28:22.468 --> 28:23.836
The department has it.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.337
I would've brought it,
but I didn't have time.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.107
Is it clean?
Clean as I could make it.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.677
So, they're gonna find
something and we're gonna
have to deal with it,

28:31.710 --> 28:32.845
that's what
you're telling me.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.613
Look, how the hell do I know,
lady?

28:34.646 --> 28:35.748
Did the best I could.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.253
Look, I'm handling it.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.922
The money and the drugs
are missing.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.456
How is that
"handling it"?

28:44.490 --> 28:46.125
Well, like I said,
maybe Big Sam stashed them.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.259
I don't know.
I'm looking.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.761
Or maybe you took 'em.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.899
Alright, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.433
When I arrived
at the accident,

28:54.466 --> 28:56.735
the money
and the drugs were gone.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.070
Y'all wanna come at me?
Bring it.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.806
You ain't gonna
find nothing.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.774
Well, we're gonna need
Big Sam's address.

29:02.842 --> 29:04.476
His girl doesn't know anything
about this.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.744
Did you talk to her
already?

29:05.778 --> 29:07.713
No.
But Tonya's a good girl.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.081
I went to high school
with her.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.952
I can handle her,
if you want.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.921
Have you touched this?
This is so soft.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.793
Mm.

29:20.827 --> 29:22.161
Okay, we're gonna take it
from here.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.662
It's like a baby lion.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.697
Mm.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.836
Word of advice --

29:29.869 --> 29:32.905
if you think you can
just blow into town and
start making messes,

29:32.939 --> 29:36.242
it ain't gonna go well.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.743
This is Montana.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.949
Thanks.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.133
Love you to stay,
but I'm late for work.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.408
Why'd you come by the motel
last night?

30:11.310 --> 30:13.812
Uh-oh.
Did I get caught?

30:13.846 --> 30:16.448
Yeah, you could've
gotten me made.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.550
How'd you even know
where I was staying, huh?

30:18.584 --> 30:20.052
Did my homework.

30:22.054 --> 30:28.394
And you know that
that was just work, right?

30:28.427 --> 30:29.695
Sure it was.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.363
Jenny, she's the front for
a connection

30:31.397 --> 30:32.564
I've been trying to make.

30:32.598 --> 30:33.900
That's how you make
a connection?

30:33.933 --> 30:35.367
No, it isn't.
I make the connection

30:35.401 --> 30:37.136
by working the assignment
for over six months.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.672
Remember?

30:40.706 --> 30:43.609
Come on.
You know how it is.

30:45.744 --> 30:47.179
Yeah, I do.

30:53.519 --> 30:57.489
I...I think we're gonna have to
lay some ground rules here.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.391
Rules?
Yeah, rules.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.227
That doesn't sound like
much fun.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.394
No?
No.

31:02.428 --> 31:03.729
Well, we can make it fun.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.031
Hmm.
Yeah.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.733
We could, uh...

31:07.766 --> 31:11.270
I don't know...
Hmm.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.239
...just, like,
sneak around.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.074
I-I don't know.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.582
As much as I'd like
to continue this...

31:23.615 --> 31:26.418
whatever you call it,
I am late for work.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.887
Maybe we can talk about this
later.

31:28.921 --> 31:30.422
Okay.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.425
You still working that, uh,
accident?

31:33.459 --> 31:35.761
Yeah.
Got nothing so far.

31:35.794 --> 31:38.364
Just blood.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.799
No bodies.
No VIN.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.570
Wait, no VIN?

31:44.603 --> 31:46.238
Yeah.

31:46.272 --> 31:49.208
It cross with something
you're working on?

31:49.241 --> 31:50.709
No.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.744
Well, you know what?
Maybe.

31:52.778 --> 31:55.414
I-I've heard about
this missing drug shipment.

31:55.447 --> 31:59.718
Yeah, that truck.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.919
I don't know.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.122

I would, uh...

Jen.

32:15.201 --> 32:16.735
Hey.
Hey.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.504
You call Jenny yet about
that warrant for Big Sam?

32:18.537 --> 32:19.905
I was just about to.

32:19.938 --> 32:20.906
I need to know
what I'm looking for first.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.608
Well, I found something.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.644
He had two one-way tickets to
Cabo booked on a debit card.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.980
Cabo?
Tonya never mentioned that.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.515
Well,
maybe she didn't know.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.617
Flights were for
the night he disappeared.

32:31.650 --> 32:36.588
Okay. So, either
he left with someone else,

32:36.622 --> 32:39.958
or she's not being
entirely truthful.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.793
I'll talk to her.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.163
You should call Jenny,
see if she can come by
and give us a hand.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.764
Okay.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.667
Yeah, go ahead
and pop the hood there.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.703
Searched it twice.
Nothing back on the blood.

32:51.737 --> 32:54.140
You put it up on the lift?
Yep.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.142
Nothin' 'cept he had
a leak in the transfer case.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.054
I'm just spinning out
a little.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.490
Um, T-Lock asked me where I got
the money for the dentist.

37:38.524 --> 37:41.493
Um...
And you told him
it was babysitting money?

37:41.527 --> 37:45.263
Yeah, yeah, I told him that,
but I don't think he bought it.

37:45.297 --> 37:46.832
Harp, this is
getting messy.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.800

37:51.937 --> 37:55.441
Cassie Dewell --
she's the PI I babysit for --

37:55.474 --> 37:57.476

just remember,

are lawyers.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.642
What is that
supposed to mean?

38:30.676 --> 38:32.344
It means that you didn't tell
them about Cassie Dewell

38:32.378 --> 38:34.546
right away for a reason,
because you knew it would be

38:34.580 --> 38:36.314
one more reason for them to
tell their parents,

38:36.348 --> 38:39.551
and if they did that, they would
be fine, and we would not.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.052
Tell me I'm wrong.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.901

a better idea?

39:04.175 --> 39:06.812
No, no, no, no, no.
That is a really bad idea.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.714
No. No, it isn't. Look, there's
this guy that I work with,

39:08.747 --> 39:10.816
and he can help us
and we wouldn't even
have to do anything.

39:10.849 --> 39:11.883
We'd just get a cut.

39:13.251 --> 39:14.886
Just think about it.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.393
You trust me,
don't you?

39:21.427 --> 39:23.595
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.732
We'll just give this guy
a sample

39:26.765 --> 39:28.233
and see how it plays out.

39:28.266 --> 39:29.835
We can do it tonight.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.571
And if it's sketchy,
then we'll bail.

39:35.607 --> 39:38.410
Harp, I don't --
I don't know.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.946
It's dangerous.
We could get hurt.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.383
You're cute
when you're scared.

40:08.507 --> 40:10.108
You know, if Sam Teske
was into drugs,

40:10.141 --> 40:12.611
it's possible
his girlfriend didn't know.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.145
Come on.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.747
If you're telling me they were
ready to pick up

40:15.781 --> 40:18.917
and move down to Mexico,
it's gotta be for a reason.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.953
She knows more than she's
letting on, Cassie.

40:21.987 --> 40:24.556
If she knew who was after him,
why would she hire me?

40:24.590 --> 40:27.258
Well, <i>that</i> is
a very good question.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.928
I'll ask her.

40:52.317 --> 40:54.085
The hell are you doing?

40:54.119 --> 40:56.121
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing?
I don't know.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.089
Looks like I just caught you
sneaking off somewhere

40:58.123 --> 40:59.224
when you should be
in bed.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.597
What's in your hand?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.365
Nothing.

41:07.398 --> 41:09.434
Show me.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.102
No.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.704
Give it to me.
No!

41:12.738 --> 41:14.272
Give it! Give it to me!
No! No!

41:14.305 --> 41:15.541
Stop!

41:21.547 --> 41:24.215
Aha!

41:26.718 --> 41:28.153
What do we have here?

41:28.186 --> 41:30.622
Some kind of
illegal substance?

41:35.326 --> 41:36.862
Tonya?

41:36.895 --> 41:40.131
What the hell
happened here?

41:40.165 --> 41:41.733
Tonya?

41:47.906 --> 41:49.407
She's gone.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.712
She must have been taken.

Donno.
