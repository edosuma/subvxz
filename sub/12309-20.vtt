WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:04.155
<i>Incoming wormhole.</i>

00:05.640 --> 00:07.153
The signal's coming in now.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.069
Todd ?

00:13.160 --> 00:17.073
<i>No doubt you're surprised to see me,</i>
<i>John Sheppard.</i>

00:17.440 --> 00:20.398
Yeah, you weren't looking so good
last time I saw you.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.631
<i>Yes, well, you'll be pleased to know</i>
<i>the treatment was successful,</i>

00:23.720 --> 00:26.359
<i>although excruciatingly painful.</i>

00:26.440 --> 00:29.273
You're just saying that
to make me feel good.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.356
<i>I was able to return to my position</i>
<i>as leader of the alliance,</i>

00:33.440 --> 00:37.035
<i>although I have had a recent setback.</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:41.272
<i>Perhaps you can see what is remaining</i>
<i>of my shuttle behind me.</i>

00:41.880 --> 00:43.108
Yeah, nice landing.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.548
<i>Don't be so critical, Sheppard.</i>

00:46.640 --> 00:47.675
<i>It wasn't long ago</i>

00:47.760 --> 00:52.470
<i>my flying skills saved the lives</i>
<i>of both you and your companions.</i>

00:53.760 --> 00:58.356
<i>It wasn't pilot error.</i>
<i>I was attacked by one of my underlings.</i>

00:59.040 --> 01:02.874
You'll excuse me for being blunt,
but why should we care ?

01:02.960 --> 01:06.270
<i>It isn't the fact that he attacked</i>
<i>and at least temporarily defeated me</i>

01:06.360 --> 01:08.157
<i>that should concern you.</i>

01:08.960 --> 01:12.316
<i>It's rather how he managed to do it.</i>

01:13.120 --> 01:14.838
And how was that ?

01:14.920 --> 01:18.117
<i>He acquired a very rare</i>
<i>and powerful piece of technology,</i>

01:18.200 --> 01:22.034
<i>one with which I believe</i>
<i>you are quite familiar.</i>

01:22.480 --> 01:24.471
- A ZPM ? Are you kidding me ?
- That's what he said.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.312
- I don't buy it.
- Why not ?

01:26.400 --> 01:28.436
Well, for one thing,
they don't exactly grow on trees.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.078
He got betrayed by one of his own people.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.435
Now he wants us
to help him clean up the mess.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.794
End of story.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.314
It is possible that he mentioned
the Zero-Point Module

01:36.400 --> 01:37.435
simply to get our attention.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.351
Except he would also have to know
that sooner or later

01:39.440 --> 01:40.953
we would discover the truth,

01:41.040 --> 01:44.032
and in the meantime, he's volunteered
to place himself in our custody.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.109
Not a very good plan.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.270
Well, you can bet
there's something he's not telling us.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.353
Granted. But that doesn't necessarily
mean that he's lying about the ZPM.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.228
If this is true, it could be very, very bad.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.199
I mean, inefficient power generation
is the Achilles' heel of Wraith technology.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.319
It's basically the reason for every
technological advantage we have.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.358
If this underling,
or whatever it is that Todd calls him,

02:05.440 --> 02:07.874
is flying around
in a ZPM-powered hive ship, then...

02:07.960 --> 02:10.155
It's a threat we can't tolerate.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.439
And we won't.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.880 --> 03:20.677
What's his condition ?

03:20.760 --> 03:22.113
Looks like he was telling the truth.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.156
There's no sign of the gene therapy
or the virus that it caused.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.993
In Wraith terms, he's completely healthy.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.116
So, he's back to feeding on humans.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.192
He's exactly the way he was
before the treatment.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.350
That's what I was afraid of.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.468
Well, here we are again.

03:50.560 --> 03:55.076
Indeed.
This city has become quite familiar to me,

03:55.560 --> 03:58.597
almost a respite from daily life.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.038
It would be a shame to see it destroyed.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.678
Are you suggesting
that if we don't help you,

04:03.760 --> 04:05.955
that would be a likely outcome ?

04:09.800 --> 04:12.439
All right. Let's start at the beginning.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.836
Where did the ZPM come from ?

04:14.920 --> 04:17.195
You recall I managed
to acquire a few of the devices

04:17.279 --> 04:19.635
from the Replicator's city
before it was destroyed ?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.153
Yes, and they were lost

04:21.240 --> 04:23.390
when Colonel Sheppard
took out the cloning facility.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.993
Not all of them.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.549
Excuse me ?

04:27.640 --> 04:30.518
I may have acquired a few more
than I let on.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.589
How many more ?

04:31.680 --> 04:34.319
Let's not get caught up
in unnecessary details.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.550
I like details.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.871
Even if I gave you a number,
you'd have no way of verifying it.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.918
You certainly won't accept my word for it,
so what's the point ?

04:43.000 --> 04:47.516
All right, then tell me this. Why now ?
You've had those ZPMs for over a year.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.113
The organic nature of the hive

04:49.200 --> 04:52.237
creates certain incompatibilities
with Ancient technology.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.676
These had to be overcome before
the modules could be put to useful work.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.910
You managed to do it
with the cloning facility.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.195
A hive is a much more
complicated proposition.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.430
Multiple systems need to be adapted.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.590
Hyperdrive, weapons, hull regeneration...

05:04.680 --> 05:08.958
I put my best scientists
to work on this project,

05:09.040 --> 05:11.600
and recently one of them succeeded.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.639
Only he didn't want to turn it over to you.
He decided to keep it for himself,

05:15.720 --> 05:19.679
and now you want us
to help you kick him to the curb.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.115
It would be in your best interest.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.999
- Does he know the location of Atlantis ?
- More unnecessary details.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.029
Well, obviously the answer is yes,

05:34.920 --> 05:37.434
and obviously you'll assume I'm lying,

05:37.520 --> 05:38.953
and obviously it won't matter

05:39.040 --> 05:42.191
because I know
you can't take the chance either way.

05:42.280 --> 05:46.637
What you really need to know
is that this hive is a work in progress.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.438
It has yet to reach its full potential,

05:50.520 --> 05:53.080
which means if you attack it now,
you may be able to destroy it,

05:53.160 --> 05:55.515
but if you hesitate, it will be too late,

05:55.600 --> 05:58.910
and this hive will be unstoppable.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.952
So we're going along with this ?

06:02.040 --> 06:04.873
The IOA has reviewed the matter,
and they feel it's worth investigating.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.393
Even though every time
we work with this guy,

06:06.480 --> 06:08.948
he manipulates us into doing something
that we didn't sign up for ?

06:09.040 --> 06:10.393
I still say he's lying.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.799
Even when he does tell the truth,

06:11.880 --> 06:14.553
it's usually just to hide
some other agenda.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.757
What about you, Colonel ?
Care to voice your objections, as well ?

06:18.760 --> 06:21.433
IOA says investigate, we investigate.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.514
All right then, we'd better get going.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.919
Colonel.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.393
Looking good.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.630
Was it really necessary
to remove my subspace transmitter

07:01.720 --> 07:05.508
and force me
to wear this ridiculous outfit ?

07:05.600 --> 07:10.151
Well, after what happened last time
on this ship, you can't blame us.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.199
I take it that my request to be
on the bridge when we make contact...

07:14.280 --> 07:16.919
- Denied.
- Understandable.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.433
Here's the problem.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.556
Every time we get involved with you,

07:20.640 --> 07:23.632
I feel like I'm walking around
with a live grenade in my pocket,

07:23.720 --> 07:28.475
just waiting for it to all go wrong,
for that one thing you forgot to mention.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.154
- I assure you, in this case...
- Save it.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.110
Been down this road before.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.719
If you really feel that way,

07:38.800 --> 07:41.394
why would you let me go
after our last encounter ?

07:41.480 --> 07:44.870
We had a deal,
and you kept up your end of the bargain.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.750
And to be honest,

07:47.840 --> 07:49.796
I didn't think you'd live.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.354
If I find out you're playing us,

07:55.080 --> 07:57.548
I'm not gonna wait for authorization.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.309
There isn't gonna be any paperwork.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.637
I'm just gonna kill you.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.708
What's the status, Colonel ?

08:11.800 --> 08:14.473
We're approaching coordinates.
You going somewhere ?

08:14.560 --> 08:16.710
Yeah, drop us out early
before we get into sensor range.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.631
- We'll check it out in a Jumper.
- That's not the plan.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.755
We can go in cloaked,

08:19.840 --> 08:21.956
stay in touch through subspace
on a secure channel.

08:22.040 --> 08:25.555
If it's what Todd says it is,
you can come in guns blazing.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.831
All right. Just be careful.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.111
Almost in range.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.433
Engaging cloak.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.188
All right. Getting readings now.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.111
It's a hive, all right.

08:49.800 --> 08:50.835
What ?

08:50.920 --> 08:53.115
I'm reading a higher than normal
energy output.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.428
I mean, significantly higher.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.274
- Consistent with the ZPM ?
- Well, it's hard to say from this far out.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.672
Sheppard, what's your status ?

09:00.760 --> 09:02.273
<i>McKay's getting some</i>
<i>interesting readings,</i>

09:02.360 --> 09:04.828
<i>so we're going in for a closer look.</i>

09:09.360 --> 09:11.874
I'm detecting massive energy output.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.793
- What's happening ?
- It's growing.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.119
What the hell are you talking about ?

09:18.200 --> 09:19.428
That's what they're doing
with the surplus energy,

09:19.520 --> 09:22.318
using it to grow a larger,
and if I'm reading this correctly,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.550
significantly denser outer hull.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.393
But it makes sense.
Normal hives have a limit of growth.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.948
I mean, any bigger or heavier,
and they become impossible to maneuver,

09:30.040 --> 09:32.634
let alone get into hyperspace.
I mean, you make a simple left turn,

09:32.720 --> 09:33.948
and you're torn apart by your own inertia,

09:34.040 --> 09:35.393
- but with a ZPM...
- I get the picture.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.629
What does that mean for us ?

09:36.720 --> 09:40.793
When they're done, my guess is
that hull will be all but impenetrable.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.476
All right, well,
we better take them out of the picture

09:44.560 --> 09:46.437
before they get that far.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.559
Hold on. They're powering their weapons.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.872
They can't see us, right ?

09:53.960 --> 09:55.871
Of course not.
They must just be running a test.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.073
Holy crap.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.436
Well, what are the odds of them
randomly firing a test shot directly at us ?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.590
I would say, given the enormity
of empty space all around us,

10:06.680 --> 10:07.908
non-existent.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.239
They can see us.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.032
They must've figured out a way
to increase the sensitivity

10:14.120 --> 10:15.758
of their scanners.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.316
Let me guess,
something to do with the ZPM ?

10:20.400 --> 10:21.435
Probably.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.876
Daedalus, <i>we got a problem.</i>
<i>Our cloak's ineffective.</i>

10:25.960 --> 10:28.315
We're on our way.
Take us in maximum sublight.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.879
- Shields up.
- Yes, sir.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.272
I'm dropping the cloak.
It ain't doing us any good.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.432
- Not to mention you could fire back.
- One thing at a time, Rodney.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.399
We're hit.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.994
I've lost controls.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.399
I'll work out a bypass. Give me a minute.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.278
If they get a bead on us, Rodney,
we're dead.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.558
It worked, sir. We blocked the shot.
Shield is holding.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.074
All right, now return fire, main battery.
Full power.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.195
Yes, sir.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.829
Direct hit.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.831
- Damage ?
- Minimal.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.675
Ready missiles. We're gonna throw
everything we have at this guy.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.751
Sir, I'm reading a massive energy buildup.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.195
Brace for impact!

11:45.240 --> 11:48.038
Shields are down.
Heavy damage on all decks.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.917
We've lost hyperdrive and main weapons.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.638
Evasive maneuvers.
We can't take another hit like that.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.513
All right,
you should have flight controls now.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.909
- What about weapons ?
- Not a chance.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.437
Something's happening.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.150
No, it doesn't make any sense.
Most of our main systems were down.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.992
These guys had us dead to rights
and they knew it.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.274
Why would they just fly away ?

12:17.360 --> 12:19.874
Perhaps it's precisely because they knew
we were no longer a threat.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.394
It's not like the Wraith to be so charitable.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.550
Todd said the ship isn't finished, right ?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.756
They haven't adapted
the full potential of the ZPM.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.353
Maybe the battle maxed them out.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.432
Well, if that's the case, I'd hate to meet up
with them when they do finish it.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.353
We need to get back to Atlantis.
What's the prognosis on the hyperdrive ?

12:34.440 --> 12:37.113
The control systems are completely shot.
My guys are working on a patch,

12:37.200 --> 12:39.634
but it could be days, even weeks,
before we're back online.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.029
For the moment,
we're not going anywhere.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.519
- Sir.
- What is it, Marks ?

12:43.600 --> 12:45.750
I think we may have something.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.070
Kavanaugh,
what the hell are you doing here ?

12:54.160 --> 12:57.277
Re-assignment. More fun
and adventure in the Pegasus Galaxy.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.113
- Show us what you got, please.
- It's a subspace signal.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.919
We detected it just before
the hive jumped into hyperspace.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.833
It was weak. Luckily,
I happened to be monitoring the sensor

13:05.920 --> 13:07.911
or we might not have picked it up at all.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.560
- It's Wraith code.
- Obviously.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.915
We're having trouble deciphering it

13:12.000 --> 13:14.514
because the message is interlaced
with a residual radiation,

13:14.600 --> 13:15.635
and I've never seen it before.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.234
I have. Once when we met another me

13:18.800 --> 13:21.075
and once when we encountered
another <i>Daedalus.</i>

13:21.160 --> 13:23.435
This signal, sent from another reality.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.232
I'm sorry,
what the hell are you talking about ?

13:25.320 --> 13:28.312
Some Wraith somewhere
in another reality sent a coded signal.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.358
Only whatever means they used
to access subspace created a rift,

13:31.440 --> 13:34.910
allowing the signal to cross
into multiple realities, including our own.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.718
So what does it say ?

13:36.800 --> 13:38.870
Just give me a second. Move.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.954
- Oh, great.
- What is it ?

13:47.640 --> 13:49.471
It's a set of coordinates.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.630
Coordinates to what ?

13:51.720 --> 13:52.835
Earth.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.111
- You think the hive picked up the signal ?
- Why else would they leave like that ?

14:02.200 --> 14:03.428
It can't be a coincidence.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.511
The Wraith know that Earth
is a much richer feeding ground

14:05.600 --> 14:06.794
than anything in the Pegasus Galaxy.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.393
They've been looking for those coordinates
for years.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.914
All right, as soon as communications
are back up, we'll contact Atlantis,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.433
have them relay a message
to Stargate Command.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.193
Wait a minute, I've got an idea.
How many ships do we have available ?

14:15.280 --> 14:17.271
Aside from ourselves,
there's the <i>Apollo</i> and the <i>Sun Tzu.</i>

14:17.360 --> 14:19.316
- How about the <i>Odyssey ?</i>
- That's on some secret mission

14:19.400 --> 14:20.549
even I'm not supposed to know about.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.596
- Then two will have to be enough.
- What are you suggesting ?

14:22.680 --> 14:24.557
Look, that hive may be super powerful
and all,

14:24.640 --> 14:26.153
but I'll bet it has to drop out of hyperspace

14:26.240 --> 14:28.470
at some point along the way
for hull regeneration.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.198
I can use the sensor data
from the Jumpers

14:30.280 --> 14:31.793
to extrapolate exactly where that'll be.

14:31.880 --> 14:32.869
That sounds pretty risky.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.234
- Lf you're wrong, it could mean...
- I won't be.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.515
Anyways, we can't afford
to wait till they get all the way to Earth.

14:36.600 --> 14:40.593
My guess is that by that point,
they'll be fully adapted to the ZPM.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.429
Do it.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.879
Sir ? The <i>Daedalus</i>
just dropped out of hyperspace.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.359
It's about time.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.113
Colonel Sheppard and his team
are beaming down.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.476
Colonel.
It's good to finally have you all back.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.629
What'd we miss ?

15:02.520 --> 15:03.953
Well, the good news is
there's no indication

15:04.040 --> 15:06.110
of any other Wraith ships
heading for the Milky Way.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.634
It's as I figured.
That signal was too short and too weak.

15:08.720 --> 15:09.994
That ship only detected it

15:10.080 --> 15:11.672
because of its obvious improvements
to the sensors.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.796
All right, what's the bad news ?

15:13.880 --> 15:14.915
Show them.

15:16.240 --> 15:17.753
This is part of a subspace message

15:17.840 --> 15:20.149
sent by Colonel Ellis
from onboard the <i>Apollo.</i>

15:20.240 --> 15:24.199
<i>We've engaged the hive.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, without much success.</i>

15:24.280 --> 15:28.592
<i>The</i> Sun Tzu <i>is crippled</i>
<i>and she's venting atmosphere.</i>

15:28.680 --> 15:31.194
<i>We're in the process</i>
<i>of taking on her crew now.</i>

15:31.280 --> 15:33.874
<i>But, unfortunately, with my engines down</i>

15:33.960 --> 15:37.077
<i>I won't be able to get to the nearest</i>
<i>stargate for at least a month.</i>

15:37.160 --> 15:42.075
<i>As for the enemy, all indications are</i>
<i>that they received very little damage</i>

15:42.160 --> 15:45.152
<i>and are continuing</i>
<i>on their previous course.</i>

15:46.080 --> 15:48.913
With those two ships out of the picture,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.436
nothing stands
between that hive and Earth.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.160
- There you are. Look, I've been thinking.
- So have I.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.753
There is another ship
that can help defend Earth.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.592
- I know. We're standing on it.
- The city, exactly.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.999
- The only problem...
- ZPMs.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.798
Yeah, but if we wanna get there
in time to make a difference,

16:10.880 --> 16:14.839
- we need a full compliment.
- Where do you think I'm headed, Rodney ?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.349
Right.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.829
Well, things didn't go
exactly according to plan.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.117
So I heard.
You intend to hold me responsible ?

16:27.200 --> 16:28.918
All I know is that
everything went sideways

16:29.000 --> 16:30.513
the way it always does
when you're involved.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.068
Are you gonna tell me
that's a coincidence ?

16:33.160 --> 16:36.311
Then you've come to make good
on your threat ?

16:41.680 --> 16:44.638
The other ZPMs you talked
to Woolsey about,

16:44.720 --> 16:48.633
tell us where to get them
and maybe it'll improve your situation.

16:48.720 --> 16:52.156
Am I supposed to be enticed by this offer ?

16:52.960 --> 16:55.190
No. I'll probably kill you anyway.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.793
But don't forget...

16:56.880 --> 16:59.075
This Wraith betrayed you
and got away with it.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.909
For no other reason,
you might want to do it out of pure spite.

17:03.680 --> 17:07.798
You know how to talk to me,
John Sheppard.

17:13.520 --> 17:14.873
We got them.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.636
He actually came through for us.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.154
Maybe he's turning over a new leaf.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.790
- Get those down to Zelenka immediately.
- Yes, sir.

17:28.880 --> 17:32.350
Or maybe they're gonna blow up
when you plug them in.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.034
- Have Dr. McKay check them first.
- Right.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.392
All right, I'm heading to the Chair Room.

17:37.480 --> 17:41.393
Actually, Colonel,
you won't be flying the city for us.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.153
In fact, you won't be coming with us at all.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.639
What are you talking about ?

17:45.720 --> 17:49.599
You have a half an hour to pack,
and then you'll be gating back to Earth.

17:49.680 --> 17:52.797
Even with the ZPMs, there's still
a good chance we won't get there in time,

17:52.880 --> 17:56.555
and Earth's only other line of defense
is the Ancient weapons platform.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.234
General O'Neill wants you in the chair.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.034
- Good luck.
- Yeah, you, too.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.636
- Colonel Sheppard.
- Colonel Carter.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.273
It's good to see you again, John.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.909
All right,
I've finished recalibration on the chair.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.433
Radek, how are things at your end ?

18:29.520 --> 18:32.956
<i>The ZPMs are online and functioning,</i>
<i>100%. We're good to go.</i>

18:33.040 --> 18:36.112
- Okay. Who's flying this puppy ?
- That would be me.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.279
- Carson ?
- Rodney.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.634
- What ? They called you in for this ?
- Aye.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.438
Well, you must have
a higher CIA than I thought.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.033
- Excuse me ?
- Chair Interface Aptitude.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.269
We have a ranking system.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.715
Well, apparently after Colonel Sheppard,
I'm number two.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.392
Really ? Gotta look into that.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.198
Well, thanks for the vote of confidence,
Rodney.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.714
- I'm sure you'll do fine.
- Great.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.391
I suppose I'm ready.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.792
Raise the shield.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.832
Dr. Beckett.

19:05.920 --> 19:06.989
Take us out.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.596
So, you're in command here, huh ?

19:44.680 --> 19:46.238
Only until General Landry gets back.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.276
He's heading up a taskforce
in Washington.

19:48.880 --> 19:52.998
My next position is to take command
of our new <i>Daedalus</i>- class ship.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.115
The <i>Phoenix ?</i>

19:54.200 --> 19:57.590
Actually, we're renaming it
the <i>General Hammond.</i>

19:58.080 --> 20:00.435
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.872
Sorry, it was kind of sudden.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.633
Heart attack. I was offworld at the time.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.034
- He was a good man.
- He really was.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.151
So, what's next ? C-130 to McMurdo ?

20:15.600 --> 20:16.953
Not exactly.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.439
Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Davis,
Homeworld Security.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.509
- Major.
- Colonel.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.079
- What are we looking at ?
- It's the hive ship.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.196
It dropped out of hyperspace
and established orbit around the moon

20:33.280 --> 20:34.269
just before you arrived.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.828
You've got to be kidding me.
It's not supposed to be here for weeks.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.876
Evidently, this is no ordinary hive ship.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.430
Yeah, that much I know. What's it doing ?

20:42.520 --> 20:44.511
For the moment, nothing.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.314
Best we can guess is it's completing
its ZPM upgrades,

20:47.400 --> 20:48.594
prior to launching an attack.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.194
Then we gotta make a move first.
You get any F-302's ?

20:51.280 --> 20:53.396
We have a squadron
on permanent standby with Earth Defense,

20:53.480 --> 20:54.913
but those birds aren't outfitted
for anything more

20:55.000 --> 20:56.115
than fighter interceptor duties.

20:56.200 --> 21:00.432
- There's no way they're gonna take on...
- How long to fit them with nukes ?

21:00.520 --> 21:02.511
That could take some doing.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.032
I'll get right on it.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.670
These pilots have any experience
fighting the Wraith ?

21:08.760 --> 21:10.239
John, that's not why I brought you here.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.276
I could sit in the chair
and wait for the Wraith to get stronger

21:12.360 --> 21:15.670
or I can take the fight to them.
What do you wanna do ?

21:30.680 --> 21:34.798
- Mr. Woolsey. You wanted to see us ?
- Yes, come in, please.

21:37.240 --> 21:41.358
I wanted the opportunity to offer you both
one last chance to reconsider.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.953
Reconsider what ?

21:43.040 --> 21:45.076
Your involvement in this mission.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.948
I'm told we're about to pass
the outer edge of the Pegasus Galaxy.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.996
If you wish to be dropped off,

21:51.080 --> 21:52.911
- now would be the time.
- Mr. Woolsey...

21:53.000 --> 21:56.879
We've all grown so accustomed
to having you here as part of the team,

21:57.880 --> 21:59.108
it's easy to lose sight of the fact

21:59.200 --> 22:04.320
that your priorities are not necessarily
always the same as ours.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.393
You're being asked to fly to another galaxy

22:07.480 --> 22:12.156
to take what might turn out to be
the losing part in a battle that isn't yours.

22:13.280 --> 22:16.955
You mean like everyone else on this base
has been doing for the last five years ?

22:17.040 --> 22:19.190
Thank you for your consideration,
Mr. Woolsey,

22:19.280 --> 22:21.953
but I assure you, it is not necessary.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.951
We're not going anywhere.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.194
Very well.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.468
All right, looks like we're ready to go.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.632
There's been a change of plans.
I'm afraid the refit took too long.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.472
The hive is still in lunar orbit,

22:52.560 --> 22:54.437
but we've detected
an inbound wave of Darts.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.750
I guess they got tired of waiting.
Any idea where the target is ?

22:56.840 --> 22:58.478
We think so.
The Wraith message we intercepted

22:58.560 --> 23:00.710
contained a warning
about Earth's defensive capabilities,

23:00.800 --> 23:02.518
specifically the drone chair.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.114
Only in the alternate reality
where the message came from,

23:05.200 --> 23:07.555
it looks like the chair
had been moved to Area 51.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.835
- That's where they're heading ?
- We believe so.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.875
Well, evacuate the base, let them hit it.

23:12.960 --> 23:16.270
When they bring the hive down,
we'll take them out from Antarctica.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.035
Right ?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.433
I'm sorry, John.
I was gonna tell you this, but...

23:20.520 --> 23:21.748
Tell me what ?

23:21.840 --> 23:24.752
The chair was in violation
of the Antarctic Non-Proliferation Treaty.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.637
After lengthy international negotiations,

23:26.720 --> 23:29.871
they finally moved it
just less than a month ago.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.919
Where ?

23:34.040 --> 23:35.234
Area 51.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.752
All right, Colonel,
they're entering the atmosphere now.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.558
It should be showing up
on the screens momentarily.

23:50.960 --> 23:51.995
All right, we got them.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.913
Twelve o'clock high,
range, 8 kilometers and closing fast.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.037
You are cleared to engage.
Good hunting, Colonel.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.749
We're seriously outnumbered.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.593
They'll never be able to keep them all
from getting through.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.673
Sheppard, two Darts have disengaged.
They're headed for the deck.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.069
- I'm on it. Riggs, you're with me.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

24:31.960 --> 24:33.712
<i>Two more on our six.</i>

24:41.840 --> 24:43.637
Riggs ? Damn it.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.959
- The Darts are coming in too fast.
- It's a kamikaze run.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.032
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.230
Stargate Command, this is Sheppard.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.232
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing ?

25:45.600 --> 25:48.592
It was a nice try, John.
There was just too many of them.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.671
The chair's been destroyed.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.468
Sheppard, what are you doing ?

25:58.600 --> 25:59.953
I got an idea.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.031
He's climbing rapidly.
He's heading into the upper atmosphere.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.270
Sheppard,
your orders are to return to the base.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.999
I still got a nuke.
I'm gonna finish this mission.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.914
You don't have enough fuel.
You'll never make it to the hive.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.672
<i>He got what he wanted.</i>
<i>He's gonna come to us.</i>

26:11.760 --> 26:12.988
He's right.
The hive ship has changed course.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.149
They're on their way.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.152
I've got enough fuel to establish orbit,

26:16.240 --> 26:18.390
then I'll shut everything down,
except basic life support.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.835
That way, he won't detect me
till it's too late.

26:20.920 --> 26:23.480
Even if that does work,
given what we know about this ship,

26:23.560 --> 26:26.552
- one nuke is not gonna be enough.
<i>- No, not from the outside.</i>

26:27.160 --> 26:29.720
I'll wait for them to enter orbit,
I'll fire up my systems,

26:29.800 --> 26:31.074
shoot my way through the Dart bay door

26:31.160 --> 26:33.230
and fly the damn bomb
right down his throat.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.675
Then, I'll detonate it from the inside.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.839
John, I can't ask you to do that.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.632
Well, you're not asking. I'm volunteering.

26:40.720 --> 26:45.635
Look, without that chair,
Earth is basically defenseless, right ?

26:49.000 --> 26:51.912
Right. Commencing radio silence.
Sheppard out.

26:59.560 --> 27:01.232
- What happened ?
- We dropped out of hyperspace.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.469
Don't tell me we're there already.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.676
We're not even close.
We're on the edge of the Milky Way.

27:04.760 --> 27:07.558
- So then why did we drop out ?
- Well, obviously we...

27:07.640 --> 27:08.789
- We're not sure.
- Doctor.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.552
Look, the hyperdrive hasn't
been operated at full power

27:10.640 --> 27:12.790
in over 10,000 years.
It's not surprising there are a few glitches.

27:12.880 --> 27:13.869
But you can fix it ?

27:13.960 --> 27:16.599
I gotta figure out what's wrong first,
don't I ?

27:16.720 --> 27:18.836
Zelenka, in the meantime,
recalibrate our gate position

27:18.920 --> 27:20.831
- so we can dial Earth.
- Yes, right away.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.309
We have to apprise them of our situation.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.639
What's our status ?

27:38.720 --> 27:42.679
The hive ship has almost reached
Earth orbit. They've begun scanning us.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.751
- Any word from Sheppard ?
- Not yet.

27:44.840 --> 27:47.354
According to my best estimates
of his trajectory,

27:47.440 --> 27:50.273
his orbit won't intersect with the hive
for another 20 minutes.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.952
Okay, now, if he fires up too early
to close the gap...

27:52.040 --> 27:54.474
They'll detect his presence
and send out Darts to intercept.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.118
He wouldn't stand a chance.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.430
- Excuse me, Colonel.
- What is it, Walter ?

27:58.520 --> 28:01.592
We've been trying to dial up the Alpha Site
to send through those IOA dignitaries...

28:01.680 --> 28:04.274
Good old IOA. Courageous to the end.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.475
- What's the problem ?
- Can't establish a lock.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.879
And it's not just the Alpha Site.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.748
I've already tried a couple of alternates,
but for some reason,

28:12.840 --> 28:14.353
the gate's offline.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.713
Open a channel.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.515
Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.512
Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.
Do you read ?

28:35.880 --> 28:38.075
Comm system is operating, sir.
They're just not responding.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.276
Okay, this is weird.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.193
I'm picking up an energy signature
feeding back through the wormhole.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.759
It's Wraith.

28:44.840 --> 28:46.592
The Wraith are at Stargate Command ?

28:46.680 --> 28:48.113
No, these readings
are more like something

28:48.200 --> 28:49.758
you'd pick up in the middle of a hive.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.512
But we dialed Earth.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.353
- You don't think that...
- Standard Wraith procedure.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.476
Keep your victims from dialing out.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.549
What are you talking about ?

28:57.640 --> 28:59.995
- There's a gate on the hive.
- What ?

29:00.080 --> 29:03.197
The Wraith always try to block the gate
of a planet they're attacking,

29:03.320 --> 29:04.992
usually by dialing in.
They couldn't do that in this case,

29:05.080 --> 29:06.274
so they came up with another solution.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.352
You see, when two gates are in proximity,
one supersedes the other.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.429
Usually it's the default gate,

29:10.520 --> 29:13.114
unless it happens to be a Milky Way model
and the other one's from Pegasus.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.997
We encountered exactly
the same problem on the Midway Station.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.348
We had to create a workaround

29:16.440 --> 29:19.034
to prevent the Pegasus gate
from always taking precedent.

29:19.120 --> 29:23.796
- You're telling me that wormhole...
- Leads directly onto the hive.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.395
- Think that cleared the way ?
- There's one way to find out.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.357
<i>The guards at the gate</i>
<i>have been neutralized.</i>

29:51.440 --> 29:52.714
<i>We're moving on.</i>

29:55.640 --> 29:57.710
I should've sent more marines with them.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.553
A full-scale assault wouldn't
have accomplished anything.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.517
If they're going to sabotage
key systems on that hive,

30:02.600 --> 30:04.909
- they're going to need speed and stealth.
- Maybe.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.991
I just hate being stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere

30:07.080 --> 30:08.069
and not able to do anything.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.879
Actually, I've got something
I've been wanting to talk to you about.

30:10.960 --> 30:13.872
This is something that Rodney's been
working on for quite some time.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.996
It's an adaptation
of an Ancient technology,

30:16.080 --> 30:17.832
which was abandoned
because of instability

30:17.920 --> 30:19.956
and enormous power requirements.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.395
- What is it ?
- Wormhole drive.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.870
It's nearly instantaneous travel
across enormous distances.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.951
It's not unlike gate travel itself.

30:28.040 --> 30:32.113
If it works, it could have us on Earth
in a matter of seconds.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.794
The calculations are incredibly complex.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.190
If we're off even by a fraction,
it could be very bad.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.279
Which way, Rodney ?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.509
I've been thinking.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.511
There was over a dozen critical systems
we could go for,

30:55.600 --> 30:57.989
but there's only one
that solves the problem once and for all.

30:58.080 --> 31:02.039
We go for the ZPM, create a fatal overload,
it takes out the whole ship, one shot.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.155
I like the sound of that.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.355
The only problem is
once I start the overload,

31:04.440 --> 31:06.351
I have no way of knowing
whether we can get off the ship in time.

31:06.440 --> 31:07.475
And you're just telling us this now.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.198
I haven't had much of a chance
to work out the details.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.794
- I'm thinking on my feet here.
- What difference does it make ?

31:11.880 --> 31:16.749
If we have a chance to destroy this ship,
we're gonna take it no matter what, right ?

31:19.320 --> 31:21.675
- Lead the way, Rodney.
- All right.

31:34.120 --> 31:36.793
<i>All right, I'd say it's time to get moving.</i>

31:53.880 --> 31:55.108
McKay!

32:01.480 --> 32:04.153
- Is there another way around ?
- I think so.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.274
- Go, go, go!
- This way.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.675
Ronon!

32:53.440 --> 32:55.351
They hit his lung. He's bleeding out.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.998
- Ronon!
- Just go!

32:58.320 --> 33:00.709
No! We are not leaving without you!

33:06.880 --> 33:08.836
Ronon! Ronon!

33:18.080 --> 33:19.229
Come on, we gotta get out of here now.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.675
Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Let's go!

33:30.520 --> 33:32.750
<i>Stargate Command, this is Sheppard.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

33:32.840 --> 33:33.989
Sheppard, where are you ?

33:34.080 --> 33:35.593
<i>I made it inside.</i>

33:36.120 --> 33:38.759
Look, I don't have much time before
this place is swarming with Wraith.

33:38.840 --> 33:42.833
- So I'm arming the nuke.
- What... Did he say "nuke" ?

33:42.920 --> 33:43.989
- John...
<i>- Just do me a favor,</i>

33:44.080 --> 33:47.789
when Atlantis shows up,
tell them I said goodbye.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.393
Sheppard, this is McKay.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.512
<i>Look, stop what you're doing now!</i>

33:51.600 --> 33:52.874
- McKay ?
- Yes, it's me.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.757
I've got Lorne and I got Teyla.
We're onboard the hive.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.876
What ? How ?

33:57.040 --> 33:58.075
Look, it's a long story.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.559
Just, the important thing is,

33:59.640 --> 34:02.518
if you're about to do what I think
you're gonna do, don't.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.239
This hive is about to attack Earth, Rodney.
I don't have much of a choice.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.514
Look, just wait. We'll come to you.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.159
I'm sure I can rig up
some kind of a remote detonator.

34:09.239 --> 34:12.232
What good is that gonna do for us ?
We can't get off this ship, Rodney.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.754
That's where you're wrong. This way.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.399
Dr. Keller.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.559
I wanted to let you know that we're
about to fire up the wormhole drive.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.072
If it works, we could find ourselves

34:25.159 --> 34:27.674
in the middle of a combat situation
rather suddenly.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.955
You and your staff need to be ready.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.632
And if it doesn't ?

34:32.480 --> 34:36.996
From what I'm told,
the city would be instantly vaporized.

34:41.719 --> 34:42.835
Okay.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.673
You guys are the last people
I expected to see on this ship.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.239
Same here. Give me a minute.

35:05.680 --> 35:06.795
Where's Ronon ?

35:08.360 --> 35:09.952
Teyla, where's Ronon ?

35:10.040 --> 35:11.632
I'm sorry, John.

35:23.200 --> 35:27.079
I restored your life, human,
and bound your wound.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.033
That was real nice of you.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.109
Now you will answer my questions.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.671
Hive has completed surface scan.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.320
They'll target military installations first,
then the power grid,

35:43.400 --> 35:45.391
send the population into a panic.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.072
Then they'll launch the Darts.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.590
How many humans are on my ship ?

35:55.840 --> 35:57.273
Where are they ?

36:03.000 --> 36:04.638
How you doing, Chewie ?

36:05.480 --> 36:07.038
You were dead!

36:07.120 --> 36:09.714
We're all gonna be dead
unless we get out of here.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.794
That's it. They're powering weapons.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.999
Sheppard, what's your status ?

36:18.560 --> 36:21.120
- We got Ronon. We're headed to the gate.
- How much time ?

36:21.200 --> 36:23.350
Five minutes to get there,
five minutes to recalibrate the DHD

36:23.440 --> 36:25.749
for local coordinates. 10 minutes.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.349
I'm sorry, the hive is powering weapons.
We're out of time.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.709
Understood.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.798
Give me the detonator.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.029
We're almost there.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.997
Look, did I say five minutes
to recalibrate the DHD ?

36:44.080 --> 36:45.798
- I meant two minutes.
- Rodney.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.115
<i>John, wait. We're detecting another ship.</i>

37:11.840 --> 37:13.193
Now would be the time, Doctor.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.675
Understood.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.310
<i>It's Atlantis! They're engaging the hive.</i>

37:29.840 --> 37:32.832
That may give us enough time
to get to the gate.

37:37.440 --> 37:38.509
Sir, the hive is returning fire.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.511
Shields are down to 70% .

37:51.240 --> 37:52.639
Keep firing, Dr. Beckett.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.790
- Get to work, Rodney.
- I'm on it.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.275
We got company!

38:14.400 --> 38:16.755
The force of enemy weapons fire
has pushed us into a lower orbit!

38:16.840 --> 38:19.957
- We're skimming the atmosphere.
- It's draining the shield, sir!

38:20.040 --> 38:21.996
Dr. Beckett, can you adjust our course ?

38:22.080 --> 38:24.275
I don't have enough power.
I can keep firing or pull us up.

38:24.360 --> 38:26.078
Which is it gonna be ?

38:27.800 --> 38:29.518
Keep firing, Dr. Beckett.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.879
- How's it coming, Rodney ?
- I got it! Dialing the Alpha Site now.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.958
Shields are about to collapse.
We can't take another hit.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.757
All right, let's move!

39:32.000 --> 39:32.989
They did it.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.279
The hive has been destroyed.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.510
Atlantis, this is Stargate Command.
Well done!

39:37.760 --> 39:41.116
Thanks for the kind words, Colonel,
but I wouldn't pop the champagne just yet.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.270
We've lost orbit
and Dr. Beckett is unable to compensate.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.395
We're going in.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.198
Do you have enough shield
to survive re-entry ?

39:48.400 --> 39:49.992
We're about to find out.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.269
Atlantis, this is Stargate Command.
Do you read ?

40:14.560 --> 40:17.711
Colonel, we've been
monitoring radio chatter.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.552
Several commercial vessels
in the North Pacific

40:19.640 --> 40:23.076
have reported a giant fireball
streaking across the sky.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.109
Atlantis, this is Stargate Command.
Do you read ?

40:28.600 --> 40:31.751
Atlantis, this is Stargate Command.
Please respond.

40:34.720 --> 40:39.032
<i>Stargate Command, this is Atlantis.</i>
<i>Nice to hear from you again, Colonel.</i>

40:39.200 --> 40:41.316
Mr. Woolsey, you gave us quite a scare.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.469
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

40:48.720 --> 40:49.914
We've completed our re-entry,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.275
and as far as I can tell,
we're still in one piece.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.191
Dr. Beckett thinks
he can bring us in over water,

40:54.280 --> 40:56.635
but you might want to alert the Navy.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.194
It's gonna be close.

40:58.560 --> 40:59.879
Understood.

41:00.280 --> 41:02.236
We are tracking them again.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.555
We should be able
to project coordinates for splashdown.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.428
Walter, you better get me the President.

41:10.520 --> 41:13.034
It looks like Atlantis is coming home.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.472
- Well, how are you feeling ?
- I'm ready to get out of here.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.471
Take your time.
The city is pretty banged up.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.632
Even with the ZPMs,
we're not going anywhere for a while.

41:23.800 --> 41:24.869
And when they fix it,

41:24.960 --> 41:27.838
you really think they're gonna let us
take it back to Pegasus ?

41:27.920 --> 41:29.911
I'll make sure you get home.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.318
This is my home.

41:34.360 --> 41:35.952
Am I interrupting ?

41:39.960 --> 41:41.791
No. I was just leaving.

41:46.920 --> 41:47.955
Hi.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.034
I heard you died and came back to life.

41:52.640 --> 41:53.959
Pretty much.

41:54.160 --> 41:57.436
There's a few things I still need to do.

42:00.360 --> 42:02.396
You up for taking a walk ?

42:02.480 --> 42:03.913
I don't see why not.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.197
Good. There's something you should see.

42:10.800 --> 42:15.669
So all's well. Your homeworld was saved,
you and your friends survived,

42:15.760 --> 42:19.036
and all thanks to my Zero-Point Modules.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.439
That's right.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.237
The question is,
what would happen next time ?

42:24.760 --> 42:27.069
Is there going to be a next time ?

42:35.320 --> 42:36.958
You have room for two more ?

42:37.040 --> 42:38.268
Of course.

42:38.720 --> 42:41.109
Ronon, welcome to Earth.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.871
No one can see us, right ?

42:47.200 --> 42:50.431
We managed to activate the cloak
before we came in too close.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.273
This entire area is under naval quarantine.

42:53.680 --> 42:55.989
So this is where everyone went, huh ?

43:00.400 --> 43:02.550
- You okay ?
- I'm alive.

43:04.920 --> 43:07.593
And I've got you. What else would I need ?

43:11.280 --> 43:13.874
- Nice view.
- Yes.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.349
Yes, it is.

43:17.305 --> 43:23.297
