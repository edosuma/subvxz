00:10.656 --> 00:14.980
Someone's saying there
wasn't anywhere to run.

00:14.981 --> 00:16.647
Serial killer pops in my head.

00:16.648 --> 00:19.557
I said, if you're here,
open this door now.

00:19.558 --> 00:22.166
I don't like it. I just
want to be out of here.

00:22.167 --> 00:24.487
He wound up murdering his own mother.

00:24.488 --> 00:26.797
- And how'd he do that?
- With an ax.

00:26.798 --> 00:30.458
Oh, [Bleep] It's time for me
to live here with my family.

00:30.459 --> 00:33.543
This guy is saying,
make sure they're dead.

00:33.544 --> 00:36.604
Make sure. Make sure.

00:37.992 --> 00:39.599
It's really bad in here.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.518
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.519 --> 00:44.499
Something is not right.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.662
I see dead people.

00:45.663 --> 00:47.903
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:47.904 --> 00:49.739
I speak to dead people.

00:49.740 --> 00:51.542
You get those chills.

00:51.543 --> 00:52.943
And they speak to me.

00:52.944 --> 00:55.412
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:55.413 --> 00:58.381
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.382 --> 00:59.954
I think she broke her neck.

00:59.955 --> 01:01.184
I rely on my partner.

01:01.185 --> 01:05.254
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:05.254 --> 01:07.256
You telling me the truth?

01:07.257 --> 01:10.391
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.392 --> 01:11.992
I think the Devil is down here.

01:11.993 --> 01:13.494
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.495 --> 01:14.842
Who the hell would do this?

01:14.843 --> 01:17.097
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.098 --> 01:19.065
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.066 --> 01:20.433
Until the very end.

01:20.434 --> 01:21.800
Who is he looking to kill?

01:21.801 --> 01:23.769
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.770 --> 01:26.071
You need to get out of here right now.

01:26.072 --> 01:27.239
Or time to get out.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.840
It was like endless darkness.

01:47.858 --> 01:51.882
Amy and I work the same case,
but from two different angles.

01:51.883 --> 01:57.037
I interview living witnesses and uncover
buried secrets from the property's past.

01:57.038 --> 02:01.172
While Amy communicates with the dead.

02:01.173 --> 02:05.409
Every once in a while, Amy and I get called
in to investigate a well-known location.

02:05.410 --> 02:07.615
This is one of those times.

02:07.616 --> 02:13.117
I'm in rural Iowa, heading over to
the infamous Villisca ax murder house.

02:13.118 --> 02:18.619
Now, here's what Amy and I
both know going into this case.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.790
June 9th, 1912.

02:20.791 --> 02:23.190
Six members of the Moore family,

02:23.191 --> 02:27.059
and two young girls who will be spending
the night with them as house guests...

02:27.060 --> 02:29.732
Walk back from the church
along a country road.

02:29.733 --> 02:33.813
Around 9:30 P.M. they arrive home.

02:34.636 --> 02:39.641
The following morning,
they will all be found dead.

02:39.642 --> 02:43.978
All murdered by a swing
of an ax to the head.

02:43.979 --> 02:48.496
Despite countless theories
and two sensational trials...

02:48.497 --> 02:51.458
No one has ever been brought to justice.

02:51.459 --> 02:56.991
And the Villisca Ax Murders remain on of
the world's most horrific unsolved crimes.

02:56.992 --> 02:59.026
But here's what Amy doesn't know...

02:59.027 --> 03:03.029
We've actually been called in by a guy
that leads tours in the ax murder house.

03:03.030 --> 03:06.790
He thinks something has followed him
home and is terrorizing his family.

03:06.791 --> 03:12.691
He sounds pretty concerned, and I'm
hoping Amy and I can help him out.

03:23.984 --> 03:26.626
Even though Amy knows
where she's going...

03:26.627 --> 03:31.163
I still have to cover anything
that may influence her findings.

03:31.164 --> 03:33.151
But what she doesn't know,

03:33.152 --> 03:37.403
is that she'll also be walking
the client's home next door.

03:37.404 --> 03:43.304
So, it's important I take my time
there to remove any leading information.

04:05.239 --> 04:09.528
In my opening, I met this
woman who's here with me.

04:09.529 --> 04:10.731
Okay.

04:10.732 --> 04:15.228
She's all disfigured,
and she is very angry.

04:15.229 --> 04:18.228
Uh, about everything.

04:18.245 --> 04:20.469
She feels responsible.

04:20.470 --> 04:24.863
Uh, because she either let
someone in or let them stay.

04:24.864 --> 04:30.764
But I hear from someone else that
it's actually her husband's fault.

04:34.253 --> 04:37.553
This doesn't feel right.

04:50.735 --> 04:53.776
John, so this is the actual house
where the murders took place.

04:53.777 --> 04:55.249
- Exactly.
- Okay.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.691
- You don't live here, though?
- No.

04:56.692 --> 05:01.535
I live right next door, where the neighbor
that found the bodies used to live.

05:01.536 --> 05:04.216
- Okay. Now, what do you do?
- I do the history tours.

05:04.217 --> 05:08.623
We'll tell people about what happened
going into the trials afterwards.

05:08.624 --> 05:09.643
Okay.

05:09.644 --> 05:12.449
But pretty soon, as I started
spending a lot of time here,

05:12.450 --> 05:16.430
I thought, in my head,
I'm gonna solve this case.

05:16.431 --> 05:19.306
And, you know, once I really
started delving into it...

05:19.307 --> 05:21.608
I've become obsessed with it.

05:21.609 --> 05:23.926
John, let me ask you,
why'd you call us in, then?

05:23.927 --> 05:28.712
I'm concerned that something
over here followed me next door.

05:28.713 --> 05:31.486
I have a wife, a
13-year-old, a 4-year-old...

05:31.487 --> 05:34.411
And we're getting scared at some
of the things that's happening.

05:34.412 --> 05:37.135
So, what kind of things are
you experiencing at your house?

05:37.136 --> 05:40.345
There's a lot doors
opening and closing, uh...

05:40.346 --> 05:42.318
The back aches, the neck aches.

05:42.319 --> 05:46.073
And I would hear growling noises,
scratching noises, things like that.

05:46.074 --> 05:49.564
So, were you experiencing stuff here first,
and then it start happening at your house?

05:49.565 --> 05:51.656
Yeah, I started experiencing
things here first,

05:51.657 --> 05:53.545
and that's what really drew me into it.

05:53.546 --> 05:56.374
I thought, wow, is this
stuff really happening?

05:56.375 --> 05:58.800
Okay. What are you
hoping we can do for you?

05:58.801 --> 06:03.007
If something's following me home from
work at my house, I don't want that there.

06:03.008 --> 06:08.454
I want a safe, happy home, and to really
just get on with the rest of my life.

06:08.455 --> 06:11.770
So, why don't you show me what's happening
here, before we go over to your house.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.051
Follow me.

06:19.758 --> 06:21.517
Mm.

06:21.518 --> 06:24.038
What's wrong?

06:31.036 --> 06:33.514
I'm just hearing someone saying...

06:33.515 --> 06:37.295
"There wasn't anywhere to run".

06:44.385 --> 06:46.229
What's going on?

06:46.230 --> 06:49.290
I just feel a lot...

06:49.329 --> 06:53.529
Of pain right here. I can't breathe.

07:03.501 --> 07:08.006
So, this is where Ina and Lena Stillinger
were found, the two overnight guests.

07:08.007 --> 07:10.241
Wow. Okay.

07:10.242 --> 07:11.876
So, what's going on in here?

07:11.877 --> 07:16.147
A lot of nausea, feeling sick,
neck hurting, back hurting.

07:16.148 --> 07:18.476
Do you feel this when
you're away from the house?

07:18.477 --> 07:19.449
No.

07:19.450 --> 07:22.526
Walk outside gone. Instantly.

07:22.527 --> 07:23.469
Wow.

07:23.470 --> 07:27.414
In this room, I've heard
a lot of loud growling.

07:27.415 --> 07:29.193
And not animal growls.

07:29.194 --> 07:34.800
This was kind of a growl, gasp,
moan combined, if that makes sense.

07:34.801 --> 07:36.512
From a human?

07:36.513 --> 07:39.037
The growl did not sound human.

07:39.038 --> 07:42.043
The gasp and moan afterwards
sounded very feminine.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.652
You don't think that has
something to do with the fact

07:43.653 --> 07:45.683
that you know two little
girls were murdered in here?

07:45.684 --> 07:47.811
Like, maybe it's something
you might've imagined?

07:47.812 --> 07:51.083
No. It was definitely loud and real.

07:51.084 --> 07:53.004
Okay.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.996
There's two females...

08:00.451 --> 08:03.031
Maybe 8 or 9.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.340
One of them likes to scare people.

08:08.401 --> 08:10.070
She growls.

08:10.071 --> 08:14.331
She's like, sometimes I like to go...

08:14.451 --> 08:17.274
Like that, she says.

08:17.275 --> 08:22.568
And I think they would hear her
and feel her before they saw her.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.723
Okay.

08:23.724 --> 08:26.339
And with them, I'm getting pain here.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.786
Oh, a lot of pain here.

08:28.787 --> 08:31.127
Oh.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.309
This was the home of Mary Peckham, the

08:42.311 --> 08:44.602
lady that found the bodies that morning.

08:44.603 --> 08:48.139
Okay. What are you
experiencing in this house?

08:48.140 --> 08:51.764
My wife had just went to work,
my daughter was at preschool.

08:51.765 --> 08:55.723
And I hear, "John"! And it startled me.
I jumped and I looked around, and nobody.

08:55.724 --> 08:57.534
I looked out the window
and you could see her

08:57.535 --> 08:59.745
car going up the street.
There was nobody here.

08:59.746 --> 09:01.984
It wasn't anybody outside
trying to get your attention?

09:01.985 --> 09:04.270
No. I looked all around the house.

09:04.271 --> 09:05.554
Okay.

09:05.555 --> 09:09.326
And there was one time, I took
the door and I latched it shut.

09:09.327 --> 09:11.858
And, just on a whim,
I said, Mary Peckham,

09:11.859 --> 09:17.759
or anything to do with the axe murder
house, if you're here, open this door now.

09:18.802 --> 09:21.071
And then it slammed open.

09:21.072 --> 09:22.973
Really? Was anybody home?

09:22.974 --> 09:25.575
No, I was alone.

09:25.576 --> 09:27.978
John's story sounded a
little too convenient.

09:27.979 --> 09:31.507
So, I started looking for any signs
that he might be stretching the truth.

09:31.508 --> 09:33.871
But as far as I could
tell, he wasn't lying.

09:33.872 --> 09:36.376
I mean, it's got to be pretty
tough on the whole family, right?

09:36.377 --> 09:40.708
Yeah. I don't want anybody in
this house scared of anything.

09:40.709 --> 09:46.147
And, at one time, I actually just
padlocked the door shut coming up here.

09:46.148 --> 09:49.370
Because it all centers
around up here, it seems like.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.291
Okay.

10:01.211 --> 10:06.159
A lot of the dead people from
next door come here... live here.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.680
Any idea why?

10:08.852 --> 10:11.552
They feel happy.

10:11.889 --> 10:15.489
They're able to be together.

10:24.234 --> 10:27.747
The older woman from outside...

10:27.748 --> 10:31.791
She's trying to talk to a person here...

10:31.792 --> 10:34.037
- Okay.
- But she's throwing a fit.

10:34.038 --> 10:37.938
Like, she is going [Bleep] crazy.

10:38.963 --> 10:43.482
The second this woman steps into this
room, she becomes filled with rage.

10:43.483 --> 10:49.383
She's had it with the living, and all
of her anger is directed at one man.

10:49.397 --> 10:54.977
She's saying, you're a guilty
[Bleep] and you know it.

10:56.167 --> 10:59.891
I had a couple friends stay the
night, they all slept in here.

10:59.892 --> 11:04.498
And the next morning, one said that he
woke up to an old woman's distorted face...

11:04.499 --> 11:06.620
Just right above his.

11:06.621 --> 11:10.533
He was pretty terrified and he
said he'd never sleep up here again.

11:10.534 --> 11:12.898
Has anybody else in the
house seen this woman?

11:12.899 --> 11:16.683
Uh... my daughter has talked
about a woman she's seen.

11:16.684 --> 11:18.318
Okay. And what does she describe?

11:18.319 --> 11:23.260
Right when we moved in, she
started talking about Hattie.

11:23.261 --> 11:28.536
I said, who is Hattie? She
goes, that's the woman upstairs.

11:28.537 --> 11:31.272
How do you talk about
ghosts to a 4-year-old?

11:31.273 --> 11:33.839
Right. I'm gonna hit you with a
question that you may not like.

11:33.840 --> 11:37.379
Now, what if Amy comes in and she
says, listen to me, you need to move.

11:37.380 --> 11:41.182
It's just not that easy. We
can't just pick up and move.

11:41.183 --> 11:43.916
And kind of the way I
see it, I often wonder

11:43.917 --> 11:46.958
is it fate that I'm supposed to be here?

11:46.959 --> 11:50.493
Could be that it's time for
me to live here with my family.

11:50.494 --> 11:52.414
Okay.

11:55.029 --> 11:59.226
The woman, she's definitely doing
some creepy [Bleep] around here.

11:59.227 --> 12:01.467
Like what?

12:01.468 --> 12:05.844
You know, somebody's seen an
apparition of her many times.

12:05.845 --> 12:08.775
But it's not normal,
she doesn't look normal.

12:08.776 --> 12:10.423
What does it look like?

12:10.424 --> 12:13.724
She's messed up. Like...

12:14.689 --> 12:16.745
Like all...

12:16.746 --> 12:18.726
Weird.

12:19.162 --> 12:24.502
I'm pretty [Bleep] sure
she's haunting these people.

12:48.575 --> 12:51.640
So, Martha, I was talking to John
and he said that you own this place.

12:51.641 --> 12:56.666
Yes, I do. My husband and I,
Darwin, purchased the house in 1994.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.736
Let me ask you a question,
did you guys know that

12:58.737 --> 13:01.162
this place might've had some
paranormal stuff going on?

13:01.163 --> 13:03.982
No. When we purchased
it, we purchased it simply

13:03.983 --> 13:06.628
because of the historical
value that it had.

13:06.629 --> 13:09.522
Do you think, maybe all these
paranormal groups coming through

13:09.523 --> 13:11.665
may be stirring some
stuff up in the house?

13:11.666 --> 13:16.211
The paranormal groups like to tell you that
perhaps the paranormal activity started

13:16.212 --> 13:19.275
when we restored it back to
what it looked like in 1912.

13:19.276 --> 13:22.532
Because a lot of the people that
had lived here in the modern world,

13:22.533 --> 13:24.611
didn't seem to experience anything.

13:24.612 --> 13:26.403
Are you worried about
the guests that come

13:26.404 --> 13:28.315
through here, or the
people that work for you?

13:28.316 --> 13:30.155
- No. No, I'm not.
- No?

13:30.156 --> 13:32.266
- Not worried about what's going on here?
- No.

13:32.267 --> 13:34.430
This is a little bit of a
different situation here.

13:34.431 --> 13:37.859
Usually, go to people's homes, where they
live, and my partner gives them advice.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.283
What if she suggested that
you stop doing the tours here?

13:41.284 --> 13:45.785
I would listen to what you had
to say, I'll take it to heart...

13:45.786 --> 13:51.066
But I probably will not
discontinue what I'm doing.

13:55.644 --> 13:57.437
She says, like, they deserve it.

13:57.438 --> 14:00.048
They deserve to suffer,
or they deserved to suffer.

14:00.049 --> 14:03.409
And I'm like, well, why?

14:04.980 --> 14:08.289
She's like, this is what
they get. They deserve it.

14:08.290 --> 14:11.256
She's adamant about this.

14:11.257 --> 14:15.045
The angry woman I met outside
is furious with the living here.

14:15.046 --> 14:19.760
She wants them to experience the
same pain she feels all the time.

14:19.761 --> 14:24.350
I mean, she's definitely about
wanting someone to suffer.

14:24.351 --> 14:30.251
But they better not think that
she's kidding, because she's not.

14:35.229 --> 14:39.287
So, Kristy, I was talking to John, and
he said you also give tours here yourself.

14:39.288 --> 14:41.863
- Yes, I do.
- Okay. And you've had experiences?

14:41.864 --> 14:43.625
Yeah, I have. I've had many.

14:43.626 --> 14:45.727
Are you okay? Because
you seem a little on edge.

14:45.728 --> 14:48.463
I... I don't like being upstairs.

14:48.464 --> 14:52.687
I've had many experiences
up here, and it's...

14:52.688 --> 14:55.696
- It makes me very uncomfortable.
- Can you tell me about 'em?

14:55.697 --> 14:59.717
Yes. I was doing a tour and um...

14:59.874 --> 15:02.095
I heard footsteps coming
up the stairs behind me.

15:02.096 --> 15:04.433
There was nobody else downstairs,
everybody was upstairs.

15:04.434 --> 15:07.157
- Okay, so you heard footsteps coming.
- I heard footsteps coming up.

15:07.158 --> 15:09.921
I ran through that bedroom
screaming into here.

15:09.922 --> 15:11.489
And um...

15:11.490 --> 15:15.147
This one guy followed me in and he
said, I heard those footsteps, too.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.005
- He didn't know why I took off running.
- Anything else?

15:18.006 --> 15:21.563
Well, one time I got my hair ruffled.

15:21.564 --> 15:24.664
- Okay.
- And another time, I was touched.

15:24.665 --> 15:26.655
- Was it anything inappropriate?
- Yeah.

15:26.656 --> 15:28.060
- It was?
- Mm hmm.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.018
Kristy, with all you've
experienced in the house,

15:30.019 --> 15:31.683
do you think whatever's
here is dangerous?

15:31.684 --> 15:33.146
Yeah, I think so.

15:33.147 --> 15:34.802
- So, why don't we go, because...
- Okay.

15:34.803 --> 15:38.283
Thanks for even doing this.

15:48.211 --> 15:54.092
So, there's a male in there who's
like, come on in here, you [Bleep]!

15:54.093 --> 15:56.493
Come on in.

15:57.930 --> 16:00.870
I don't feel good.

16:00.939 --> 16:03.459
So much uh...

16:03.524 --> 16:07.064
Commotion and movement and...

16:07.102 --> 16:10.402
Fear and panic and pain.

16:10.444 --> 16:13.141
And there's so...

16:13.142 --> 16:17.250
There's a lot of people in the house.

16:17.251 --> 16:20.086
When all this is... there's
so many people in the house.

16:20.087 --> 16:24.020
All of these people are trapped here.

16:24.021 --> 16:27.501
Especially these three kids.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.980
I know most of the basic facts
about the Villisca Ax Murders.

16:47.981 --> 16:53.881
But in order to help my clients, I need to
speak with the foremost expert on the case.

16:54.082 --> 16:57.083
I need him to tell me what
happened the night that two adults,

16:57.084 --> 17:02.984
and six children were murdered
on the property I'm investigating.

17:12.881 --> 17:18.337
It remains one of the more
spectacular cases in Iowa history.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.127
- There were eight people killed.
- Okay.

17:21.127 --> 17:25.560
You had Joe and Sarah Moore
and their four children.

17:25.560 --> 17:28.861
Here's two of the kids.

17:29.234 --> 17:31.901
And then, there were two
girls visiting that night.

17:31.902 --> 17:34.280
- Okay.
- And they were the Stillinger girls.

17:34.281 --> 17:36.801
Ina and Lena.

17:38.263 --> 17:42.354
Can you just take me back to what
happened leading up to the murders?

17:42.355 --> 17:45.770
Sunday night, the 9th of June,
they all went to church together.

17:45.771 --> 17:46.682
Okay.

17:46.683 --> 17:50.926
They were having a special service, which
was called the children's day service.

17:50.927 --> 17:55.292
They had a guest that night, a
minister, Lyn George Jacklin Kelly.

17:55.293 --> 17:57.512
Never been in Villisca before.

17:57.513 --> 18:02.681
And he was going to later be accused
of the murder and tried for it.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.670
But acquitted.

18:04.671 --> 18:07.971
And then, the eight of
them were going home.

18:07.972 --> 18:11.465
And there's a rumor at least,
that one of the children

18:11.466 --> 18:15.846
thought they saw somebody in the bushes.

18:18.933 --> 18:21.511
I'm seeing this man...

18:21.512 --> 18:23.734
Standing...

18:23.735 --> 18:26.915
In the trees, watching.

18:28.424 --> 18:34.324
He was angry and jealous, and I hear
somebody say that he was very religious.

18:35.097 --> 18:39.250
Then, the next morning, the
next house west from theirs...

18:39.251 --> 18:42.722
30 feet away, a woman named Peckham...

18:42.723 --> 18:46.107
Noticed that there was no
activity around the Moore house.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.009
That's the house where
my client's living now.

18:48.010 --> 18:49.401
Yep.

18:49.402 --> 18:53.931
Peckham shouted, knocked on
the door, got no response.

18:53.932 --> 18:56.728
She called Joe's brother.

18:56.729 --> 19:02.629
He and Mrs. Peckham walk through
the front parlor to a back bedroom.

19:02.873 --> 19:05.512
Lying in the bed were two figures.

19:05.513 --> 19:06.439
Okay.

19:06.440 --> 19:10.054
On the bedstead behind them,
there were... there was blood.

19:10.055 --> 19:12.600
And they called for the town marshal.

19:12.601 --> 19:16.263
So, he looks around the room,
and the killer has taken a...

19:16.264 --> 19:22.164
A woman's black skirt out of a
dresser and draped it over the mirror.

19:22.567 --> 19:27.127
The ax is leaning
against the south wall.

19:27.190 --> 19:29.583
And it's got blood and hair on it.

19:29.584 --> 19:33.770
They had all been killed
with the back of the ax.

19:33.771 --> 19:39.125
Mrs. Moore, she was the only one
struck with the blade of the ax.

19:39.126 --> 19:40.358
Interesting.

19:40.359 --> 19:45.877
And they were so disfigured, they
were mutilated beyond recognition.

19:45.878 --> 19:49.187
And their faces had been
covered with a piece of clothing.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.084
And then the covers had
been pulled over them.

19:52.085 --> 19:56.815
And leaning beside the ax is a
four-pound piece of slab bacon.

19:56.816 --> 20:00.194
That's odd. Now, was there
any theory about the bacon?

20:00.195 --> 20:03.433
There was one theory, that the killer...

20:03.434 --> 20:07.172
Rolled it into a tube and
used it as a masturbatory aid.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.506
Wow. Serial killer pops in my head.

20:09.507 --> 20:11.607
Mm-hmm.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.744
I just hear crying. A lot of crying.

20:20.745 --> 20:26.145
And I do see somebody being
dragged across the floor.

20:27.216 --> 20:32.123
And I hear a male voice saying, it's
gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

20:32.124 --> 20:34.403
This kid knew this guy.

20:34.404 --> 20:37.458
She knows this person
very well, very well.

20:37.459 --> 20:38.859
Okay.

20:38.860 --> 20:43.900
And there was struggling.
What is going on here?

20:44.137 --> 20:47.129
There's, like, physical...

20:47.130 --> 20:48.388
Stuff happening.

20:48.389 --> 20:52.038
Like, there's a man saying,
make sure that they're dead.

20:52.039 --> 20:53.816
Uh, make sure.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.097
Make sure.

21:10.071 --> 21:13.561
There's a man saying, make
sure that they're dead.

21:13.562 --> 21:15.842
Make sure.

21:16.122 --> 21:19.191
There's the woman again.

21:19.192 --> 21:21.877
She says, how can you let them do this?

21:21.878 --> 21:23.397
How can you let them do this?

21:23.398 --> 21:26.758
Aren't they your friends?

21:27.031 --> 21:30.811
Like, she's hysterically crying.

21:32.855 --> 21:34.753
I need to find out what kind of evidence

21:34.754 --> 21:36.810
the cops collected when
they got to the scene.

21:36.811 --> 21:40.018
So, I'm heading to the state capital
to meet with the County Sheriff.

21:40.019 --> 21:42.364
And he said he can tell
me exactly what they found,

21:42.365 --> 21:48.265
and why it led them to narrow down
their suspect list to four men.

21:59.512 --> 22:01.805
- Hey, Joe.
- Hi, Steve. How are you doing?

22:01.806 --> 22:03.418
Thanks for meeting me, I appreciate it.

22:03.419 --> 22:05.723
Now, I wanted to talk to
another cop about this.

22:05.724 --> 22:09.382
I mean, can you take me
through the crime scene itself?

22:09.383 --> 22:12.856
Basically, the crime scene
was quickly deteriorated

22:12.857 --> 22:16.149
by a whole barrage of
people going through there.

22:16.150 --> 22:17.090
It was tainted.

22:17.091 --> 22:19.218
So, you had civilians walking
through the crime scene?

22:19.219 --> 22:21.612
- That's right.
- Wow, okay.

22:21.613 --> 22:25.375
I know this guy Kelly
was arrested and charged.

22:25.376 --> 22:28.806
Reverend George Kelly. He
was one of the four suspects.

22:28.807 --> 22:32.453
The first suspect
would've been F.F. Jones.

22:32.454 --> 22:35.427
Mr. Moore had worked
for him for nine years.

22:35.428 --> 22:38.211
They got into a disagreement over wages.

22:38.212 --> 22:39.941
Mr. Moore went on his own.

22:39.942 --> 22:43.774
And when he left, he took one
of Mr. Jones' biggest customers.

22:43.775 --> 22:47.056
Also, there was the rumor that...

22:47.057 --> 22:50.199
Mr. Moore was having an affair.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.470
With his daughter-in-law.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.332
- F.F.'s daughter-in-law?
- That's right.

22:53.333 --> 22:56.862
Doesn't sound like it was
enough for him to kill six kids.

22:56.863 --> 23:00.918
Well, that's where suspect
number two comes in.

23:00.919 --> 23:03.313
William Blackie Mansfield.

23:03.314 --> 23:07.102
It is rumored Mr. Jones
had hired Mr. Mansfield...

23:07.103 --> 23:08.514
To do his dirty work.

23:08.515 --> 23:10.719
Did they ever bring him
in, charge him, or anything?

23:10.720 --> 23:15.786
He had an alibi. He was actually in
Chicago, Illinois, working, at the time.

23:15.787 --> 23:17.586
Henry Lee Moore.

23:17.587 --> 23:19.575
Well, he looks the
part, that's for sure.

23:19.576 --> 23:20.902
Yes, he does.

23:20.903 --> 23:23.243
He wound up, two years later...

23:23.244 --> 23:28.086
Murdering his own mother and
Grandmother in Columbia, Missouri.

23:28.087 --> 23:30.302
- And how'd he do that?
- With an ax.

23:30.303 --> 23:32.098
- Bludgeoned them to death.
- Okay.

23:32.099 --> 23:34.968
- But, he's arrested and charged, I guess?
- He had an alibi.

23:34.969 --> 23:37.736
The only one that was ever
arrested and charged...

23:37.737 --> 23:40.028
Was reverend George Kelly.

23:40.029 --> 23:42.841
Joe, what wound up leading
the guys to arrest him?

23:42.842 --> 23:45.479
Someone said that they overheard him

23:45.480 --> 23:48.581
talking about the murders when
he was leaving that morning.

23:48.582 --> 23:50.998
He caught the 5:30
train out of Villisca.

23:50.999 --> 23:54.388
And they didn't discover the
murders until around 7:00 A.M.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.491
Well, it was several years
later that they arrested him.

23:57.492 --> 23:59.491
He's the one that was charged.

23:59.492 --> 24:01.537
- But acquitted twice.
- Acquitted twice.

24:01.538 --> 24:05.798
And so, the case is still open today.

24:07.941 --> 24:10.558
There was a deal, and it went wrong.

24:10.559 --> 24:14.099
There are four men involved.

24:15.019 --> 24:18.259
I did hear, um, like...

24:18.585 --> 24:20.513
Conspiracy [Bleep].

24:20.514 --> 24:22.956
Like, a cover-up.

24:22.957 --> 24:25.513
These men had marks on them.

24:25.514 --> 24:27.420
Scratches and...

24:27.421 --> 24:33.321
I just hear men talking to each other
about making sure that it's done.

24:34.561 --> 24:38.461
Not everyone was supposed to die.

24:42.035 --> 24:45.481
Now that I know that Reverend Kelly went
on trial for the Villisca Ax Murders.

24:45.482 --> 24:48.532
I'm meeting a crime historian
who is going to explain to me why

24:48.533 --> 24:54.293
there was no justice for the
victims of this brutal crime.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.718
This was the room where
Reverend Kelly stood

24:59.719 --> 25:02.488
trial twice for the Villisca Ax Murders.

25:02.489 --> 25:05.893
- So, what happened with the first trial?
- The first trial ended in a hung jury.

25:05.894 --> 25:07.472
So, what went wrong?

25:07.473 --> 25:09.662
The state had a pretty strong case.

25:09.663 --> 25:12.965
There was, of course,
a confession by Kelly.

25:12.966 --> 25:15.598
- This is it?
- Yes.

25:15.599 --> 25:17.084
What was he saying?

25:17.085 --> 25:19.499
He heard the voice of God.

25:19.500 --> 25:23.088
Telling him to slay utterly,
and it went on in this vein.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.949
Wow.

25:25.035 --> 25:27.047
What other evidence did
they have against him?

25:27.048 --> 25:29.382
They had what was
called the bloody shirt.

25:29.383 --> 25:31.596
A couple of days after the murders,

25:31.597 --> 25:35.080
he took one of these white shirts
to the laundry in Council Bluffs.

25:35.081 --> 25:36.489
We have a confession.

25:36.490 --> 25:39.845
We have two credible witnesses
who say he talked about the murders

25:39.846 --> 25:42.472
before the bodies were
even found, on the train.

25:42.473 --> 25:44.439
We've got a bloody T-shirt.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.682
To me, it sounds like
a pretty decent case.

25:46.683 --> 25:47.959
So, what went wrong?

25:47.960 --> 25:51.274
Kelly was a pathetic figure.

25:51.275 --> 25:54.704
He was a very small fellow
and he was a minister.

25:54.705 --> 25:58.066
This is the Bible Belt
after all, and uh...

25:58.067 --> 26:01.415
Ministers don't go around
killing kids with an ax.

26:01.416 --> 26:03.736
So now, what went wrong
on the second trial?

26:03.737 --> 26:08.520
The second trial was just, essentially, a
rerun that was done rather halfheartedly.

26:08.521 --> 26:14.421
The prosecution, in fact, did not even
use the confession in the second trial.

26:15.899 --> 26:21.719
One of these men was really
cool with doing this torturing.

26:26.905 --> 26:28.539
He's a little guy.

26:28.540 --> 26:32.368
Probably my height,
but really thin, pale.

26:32.369 --> 26:35.549
Uh, his face is weird.

26:36.835 --> 26:40.255
He's a little crazy dude.

26:45.222 --> 26:49.622
During my walk, I saw a group of
men conspiring to commit murder.

26:49.623 --> 26:52.553
I'm having a sketch artist
draw one of the killers.

26:52.554 --> 26:56.664
He had a very oval kind
of shape to his head.

26:56.665 --> 26:59.485
He was very thin.

26:59.722 --> 27:03.971
His hair, definitely,
was dark and greasy.

27:03.972 --> 27:06.327
Next, I had him sketch the angry woman

27:06.328 --> 27:08.980
screaming at a living
man in the other house.

27:08.981 --> 27:13.977
And there's a bed, and
there was a person sleeping.

27:13.978 --> 27:16.678
And this lady...

27:16.800 --> 27:20.336
Was at the end of the bed.

27:20.337 --> 27:23.457
And her face is rage.

27:23.828 --> 27:26.614
Is this what you saw?

27:26.615 --> 27:28.475
Yes.

27:51.686 --> 27:54.763
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

27:54.764 --> 27:59.336
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

27:59.337 --> 28:02.853
Well, Amy, this is an unusual case
for both of us, because we both had a

28:02.854 --> 28:06.152
little bit of knowledge of the tragedy
that had happened in this house.

28:06.153 --> 28:09.889
Now, what you don't know is that
we were actually called in by John.

28:09.890 --> 28:15.790
Now, John's a tour guide here.
He actually lives in that house.

28:16.099 --> 28:21.206
He thinks something may have followed
him home, and it's terrorizing his family.

28:21.207 --> 28:26.672
Now Kristy here works as a tour guide, as
well, and she's terrified in that house.

28:26.673 --> 28:30.777
She doesn't want to leave, but she's
afraid to come into this house and work.

28:30.778 --> 28:33.317
Now, I'm curious, Amy,
coming into this case,

28:33.318 --> 28:35.838
how much did you know
about what took place here?

28:35.839 --> 28:40.351
I knew that there was a mass
murder that had been committed here.

28:40.352 --> 28:43.687
Of a family, two children were visiting.

28:43.688 --> 28:47.519
That it occurred at night,
that it was done with an ax.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.433
And that's about it.

28:49.434 --> 28:50.596
Okay.

28:50.597 --> 28:55.970
So, with that, I'm gonna turn it over to
Amy, and she can tell us about her walk.

28:55.971 --> 28:59.304
So this walk, for me, was
absolutely overwhelming.

28:59.305 --> 29:04.976
Like, I could not believe that
pretty much everybody is still here.

29:04.977 --> 29:10.877
And when I showed up on the
location, I felt a lot of pain.

29:11.180 --> 29:16.678
Like, having a hard time
breathing and severe back pain.

29:16.679 --> 29:20.280
John, you had mentioned to me about
headaches and pain you go through.

29:20.281 --> 29:22.971
Being in the house, certain
places, certain times,

29:22.972 --> 29:26.308
extreme nausea, neck pain, back pain.

29:26.309 --> 29:28.159
Come out of the house, completely fine.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.845
Yeah, mm-hmm.

29:29.846 --> 29:31.921
I have trouble breathing sometimes.

29:31.922 --> 29:36.241
It feels like someone's
standing on your chest.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.977
One of the strongest
entities I met was this woman.

29:38.978 --> 29:44.318
She's pretty short, pale,
and she was very spiteful.

29:44.688 --> 29:48.408
Angry, and she made me feel...

29:48.809 --> 29:51.569
The initial pain.

29:52.288 --> 29:56.170
The other thing is, she would
go back and forth about blame.

29:56.171 --> 30:01.934
She feels responsible because she
either let someone in or let them stay.

30:01.935 --> 30:07.835
But I hear from someone else that
it's actually her husband's fault.

30:08.043 --> 30:10.554
- Now, was she one of the murder victims?
- Yes.

30:10.555 --> 30:11.953
- She was?
- Yes.

30:11.954 --> 30:14.563
And there's only one woman
that was murdered in this house.

30:14.564 --> 30:16.232
This is Sarah Moore.

30:16.233 --> 30:20.244
- That look like who you might've seen?
- Yes. Oh, yes.

30:20.245 --> 30:23.234
She lived here with her
husband and four kids.

30:23.235 --> 30:25.557
There was Herman, who was 11.

30:25.558 --> 30:27.555
There was Katherine, who was 10.

30:27.556 --> 30:30.438
And then they had two
other kids, Boyd and Paul.

30:30.439 --> 30:32.195
Seven and five.

30:32.196 --> 30:35.147
Now, you mentioned the
woman you saw was angry.

30:35.148 --> 30:36.201
Yes.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.745
That's interesting because
Sarah Moore was the only

30:38.746 --> 30:41.462
one that was hit with
the sharp end of the ax.

30:41.463 --> 30:43.681
The rest of them were hit
with the back end of the ax.

30:43.682 --> 30:45.381
Really?

30:45.382 --> 30:47.806
So, John, how do you feel
knowing that one of the murder

30:47.807 --> 30:50.170
victims is actually here in
the house, and she's pissed?

30:50.171 --> 30:51.850
Definitely sad.

30:51.851 --> 30:55.991
You know, nobody wants anybody stuck.

31:00.524 --> 31:02.163
What else?

31:02.164 --> 31:06.324
In the downstairs
bedroom there's two girls,

31:06.325 --> 31:12.225
but there was one girl, specifically,
who enjoys interacting with the living.

31:12.318 --> 31:14.949
She tries to get attention.

31:14.950 --> 31:17.849
She tries to talk to people...

31:17.850 --> 31:21.090
And she likes to growl.

31:23.081 --> 31:27.096
The growling that I've heard
is in that exact bedroom.

31:27.097 --> 31:32.829
It was a growl, gasp, moan,
kind of combined all together.

31:32.830 --> 31:35.263
You know that there were the
two visiting Stillinger kids?

31:35.264 --> 31:36.407
- Yes.
- All right.

31:36.408 --> 31:40.012
Those were the two girls that were
murdered in the downstairs bedroom.

31:40.013 --> 31:42.939
This is Lena, who was 11.

31:42.940 --> 31:46.436
This is Ina. She was 8 years old.

31:46.437 --> 31:49.617
Which one do you think
might be the one interacting?

31:49.618 --> 31:51.516
I think it's her.

31:51.517 --> 31:53.605
- Lena?
- Yeah.

31:53.606 --> 31:59.043
She's the most active one, and
wants feedback and reactions.

31:59.044 --> 32:01.984
She wants attention.

32:05.354 --> 32:07.914
So, as far as what
happened, it was really hard

32:07.915 --> 32:12.056
to piece together what
I think are the facts.

32:12.057 --> 32:15.107
There was a lot of chaos going on.

32:15.108 --> 32:19.178
Like, I did hear a man saying that
it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

32:19.179 --> 32:23.313
I heard someone else say,
there's no place to run.

32:23.314 --> 32:25.550
And then, I saw her...

32:25.551 --> 32:29.795
Getting dragged across
the room by her leg.

32:29.796 --> 32:33.968
And she had this confused look on
her face, because she knew this man.

32:33.969 --> 32:38.796
And then I heard a male say,
make sure they're all dead.

32:38.797 --> 32:42.937
When I went upstairs,
I saw the woman, Sarah.

32:42.938 --> 32:47.162
She was huddled in the
corner, holding a small child,

32:47.163 --> 32:50.416
and she was screaming, why
aren't you doing anything?

32:50.417 --> 32:51.951
How can you let them do this?

32:51.952 --> 32:55.052
You know. Aren't they your friends?

32:55.053 --> 32:57.922
And the killer was talking
about how something went wrong.

32:57.923 --> 33:00.513
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

33:00.514 --> 33:05.306
His meaning was that not everybody
in the house was supposed to die.

33:05.307 --> 33:10.694
But something went wrong, a deal went
wrong, and this was focused on revenge.

33:10.695 --> 33:15.375
And I believe there
were four men involved.

33:15.397 --> 33:19.921
She amazes me one case after the next I
can tell you I'm always blown away by her.

33:19.922 --> 33:22.245
But I got to respectfully
disagree with her.

33:22.246 --> 33:24.349
I don't see it happening that way.

33:24.350 --> 33:26.482
There were four suspects, though.

33:26.483 --> 33:27.876
Interesting.

33:27.877 --> 33:31.161
First one was a guy
that was Moore's boss.

33:31.162 --> 33:33.783
This guy, F.F. Jones.

33:33.784 --> 33:36.201
When Moore left the business...

33:36.202 --> 33:39.862
He actually took the biggest account
that they had and took it with them.

33:39.863 --> 33:41.564
Yeah. I think that's it.

33:41.565 --> 33:47.064
Also, there was a rumor that J.B. Moore was
having an affair with his daughter-in-law.

33:47.065 --> 33:49.172
Oh, that's why.

33:49.173 --> 33:52.319
But you don't kill six
children over an affair.

33:52.320 --> 33:56.385
The second major suspect was
a guy named Blackie Mansfield.

33:56.386 --> 33:59.815
It was said that F.F. Jones
hired him to kill the family.

33:59.816 --> 34:03.719
But, he had an alibi and he couldn't
have been in Villisca at the time.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.008
So, it was dismissed.

34:06.009 --> 34:10.295
Then you've got Henry Lee
Moore, no relation to the family.

34:10.297 --> 34:15.755
He was a drifter, but nobody could place
him in Villisca the night of the homicide.

34:15.755 --> 34:20.255
Which brings us to
reverend George Kelly.

34:21.849 --> 34:24.672
This guy was in town the
night of the homicides.

34:24.674 --> 34:28.610
He attended the church that the
entire Moore family was at that night.

34:28.610 --> 34:31.179
He's put on trial twice.

34:31.179 --> 34:33.349
First trial was a hung jury.

34:33.350 --> 34:35.647
Second time, he was acquitted.

34:35.648 --> 34:38.502
Now, one of the things
they had on him...

34:38.503 --> 34:41.170
The next morning he gets on the
train at 5:30 in the morning,

34:41.170 --> 34:44.103
and he discusses the murder
that took place at this house.

34:44.103 --> 34:47.337
The bodies weren't discovered
until 7:00 in the morning.

34:47.338 --> 34:49.301
So, how would he know about that?

34:49.302 --> 34:53.608
Second this is, a few days later, he drops
off a bloody T-shirt to a dry cleaner.

34:53.609 --> 34:57.329
And he wrote out a confession.

34:58.173 --> 35:00.850
He puts himself here. Says
he's killed the Moores.

35:00.851 --> 35:02.628
Said God made him do it.

35:02.629 --> 35:08.529
Well, one of the men who was active
in the murders, I met in the barn.

35:09.031 --> 35:12.421
He was short, very thin and pale.

35:12.422 --> 35:16.696
He really enjoyed, like, torturing them.

35:16.697 --> 35:22.597
I got a really quick look at
him, but I did a sketch anyway.

35:25.944 --> 35:27.804
Wow.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.831
Take a look at that.

35:35.832 --> 35:37.215
Wow.

35:37.216 --> 35:42.016
Yeah, that definitely
resembles Reverend Kelly.

35:42.424 --> 35:46.346
Oh, yeah. It looks like the same man.

35:46.347 --> 35:50.667
Amy, what do you think? Is this Kelly?

35:51.625 --> 35:53.773
- Yes.
- Okay.

35:53.774 --> 35:55.718
But he's not the only one.

35:55.719 --> 35:57.767
He's just one of 'em.

35:57.768 --> 35:59.695
I agree with her.

35:59.696 --> 36:00.557
Okay.

36:00.558 --> 36:04.182
How did one person control
eight people, and nobody got out?

36:04.183 --> 36:05.845
Mm-hmm.

36:05.846 --> 36:09.539
Anything's possible. I'd never
throw anything off the table.

36:09.540 --> 36:14.603
My experience working homicide tells me
serial killers almost always act alone.

36:14.604 --> 36:18.533
But I've worked with Amy long enough to
know that she see things no one else has.

36:18.534 --> 36:21.502
And if she thinks more than
one man committed those murders,

36:21.503 --> 36:25.196
I can't find any evidence to
prove or disprove her theory.

36:25.197 --> 36:29.521
I am glad that we both agree that this
scumbag was involved in the homicide.

36:29.522 --> 36:32.323
Without a doubt, yeah.

36:32.324 --> 36:35.460
Well, we didn't just come here to
investigate what might've happened here.

36:35.461 --> 36:40.111
But also, he's having issues in his
house, which you also walked, right?

36:40.112 --> 36:41.684
- Yes.
- Okay.

36:41.685 --> 36:44.427
When I was over there, I...

36:44.428 --> 36:49.648
Saw that most of the
family go hang out in there.

36:49.837 --> 36:52.156
It was nice downstairs.

36:52.157 --> 36:57.836
Then, I'm, like, walking up the
stairs and almost when you hit...

36:57.837 --> 37:01.644
The floor, it was just complete anger.

37:01.645 --> 37:03.865
With her.

37:06.204 --> 37:10.415
If I were you, I would be
very careful in this house.

37:10.416 --> 37:13.416
It's pretty intense.

37:27.233 --> 37:32.856
Then, I'm, like, walking up the
stairs and almost when you hit...

37:32.857 --> 37:36.610
The floor, it was just complete anger.

37:36.611 --> 37:38.831
With her.

37:39.384 --> 37:44.904
If I were you, I would be
very careful in this house.

37:46.923 --> 37:52.549
The whole downstairs has always
seemed very peaceful and welcoming.

37:52.550 --> 37:56.021
But the upstairs has always
been full of footsteps and

37:56.022 --> 37:59.036
doors opening and
closing and noises and...

37:59.037 --> 38:03.409
Well, it was so bad he moved his
family from upstairs to downstairs.

38:03.410 --> 38:08.990
When I saw her upstairs,
she's, like, in a blind rage.

38:09.142 --> 38:12.408
She makes it a point to
haunt the living people.

38:12.409 --> 38:16.203
She said that the living
people up there deserve it.

38:16.204 --> 38:21.159
I got that she does direct
her anger towards a male.

38:21.160 --> 38:26.259
And it didn't make sense, because
she blames him for what happened.

38:26.260 --> 38:32.121
Well, John admitted to me that he was
pretty much obsessed about this case.

38:32.122 --> 38:36.165
For me, I felt a genuine
love for this family.

38:36.166 --> 38:40.018
And I thought if I
find out who did this,

38:40.019 --> 38:43.565
then maybe they can be
at peace and be happy.

38:43.566 --> 38:48.209
I felt like I was called to do
that, like I had to figure out...

38:48.210 --> 38:52.650
In my head, who did it, for the family.

38:56.444 --> 38:59.744
So I did a sketch of...

39:00.556 --> 39:03.891
A situation that I
saw at the other house.

39:03.892 --> 39:06.530
And it was of Sarah...

39:06.531 --> 39:08.931
Going crazy.

39:09.029 --> 39:11.429
And yelling.

39:25.438 --> 39:28.540
Looks like she's wigging out.

39:28.541 --> 39:31.321
It's not a good feeling to...

39:31.322 --> 39:35.451
Do something you love, and
trying to do it in a good way.

39:35.452 --> 39:38.932
And have that person angry.

39:41.984 --> 39:45.784
Well, this was a pretty
intense case for both Amy and I.

39:45.785 --> 39:49.001
And you've got to be relieved that
you finally know what's going on here.

39:49.002 --> 39:50.795
Mm-hmm.

39:50.796 --> 39:54.233
But, the big question is, can you
guys live and work here safely?

39:54.234 --> 40:00.134
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy
and see if she can come up with an answer.

40:00.951 --> 40:05.571
What happened here is
absolutely horrendous.

40:06.208 --> 40:07.698
Mm-hmm.

40:07.699 --> 40:12.559
These people, from the
day that this happened.

40:12.678 --> 40:16.096
Have never had any kind of peace.

40:16.097 --> 40:19.697
Not only are they reliving...

40:21.356 --> 40:23.835
What happened to them constantly.

40:23.836 --> 40:26.852
They're also seeing other
people coming and going,

40:26.853 --> 40:30.734
and it's made to be a sideshow.

40:30.735 --> 40:33.439
And it needs to stop.

40:33.440 --> 40:36.769
Because if this continues
to stay a tourist attraction,

40:36.770 --> 40:40.513
I don't think they're
gonna find any peace.

40:40.514 --> 40:42.795
I did speak with the owner, Martha.

40:42.796 --> 40:45.267
And I can tell you after
speaking with her that,

40:45.268 --> 40:48.471
she is not gonna change the
way things are done here.

40:48.472 --> 40:52.347
So, John, would you ever consider
talking to the owner and asking to change,

40:52.348 --> 40:54.208
or do you think it'd be a waste of time?

40:54.209 --> 40:56.909
We don't want it to be disrespectful.

40:56.910 --> 40:59.655
I know Martha's intentions are right on.

40:59.656 --> 41:02.498
She doesn't want it to be disrespectful.

41:02.499 --> 41:07.923
And the way I give my tours, I need
to just delve on the history, you know?

41:07.924 --> 41:11.988
We want to honor the family
and we want to do good.

41:11.989 --> 41:14.956
She had a message to
get through to you on how

41:14.957 --> 41:17.340
to change things, and
you've gotten that.

41:17.341 --> 41:21.625
And that is what's going
to give this family peace.

41:21.626 --> 41:24.566
So you were chosen.

41:24.824 --> 41:28.157
- How does that make you feel?
- Really shocked.

41:28.158 --> 41:34.058
There's a reason I ended up
here, and I never understood why.

41:34.174 --> 41:38.861
I know, John, that you're not in
a position to make decisions here...

41:38.862 --> 41:42.655
On changing things, but are
you gonna do what you can?

41:42.656 --> 41:46.433
Absolutely. We all want
the best for them here.

41:46.434 --> 41:51.613
It'd be nice to enter the house
and not be nervous and scared.

41:51.614 --> 41:54.363
I wish the tours could stop completely.

41:54.364 --> 41:57.168
But I'm encouraged that
John and Kristy promise

41:57.169 --> 42:00.372
to limit the tours to
the history of the house.

42:00.373 --> 42:04.242
It seems to be a story that the
dead in this place want told.

42:04.243 --> 42:08.819
And it should help bring
them peace, at least for now.
