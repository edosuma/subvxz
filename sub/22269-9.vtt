WEBVTT

01:34.929 --> 01:36.846
No! No!

01:36.847 --> 01:38.389
I just want--

01:38.390 --> 01:40.266
Help! Get off! Get off!

01:40.267 --> 01:42.727
No! No! No...

03:02.433 --> 03:04.809
<i>Thank you, Dirk Gently.</i>

03:04.810 --> 03:07.770
I am so grateful to you.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.814
If you weren't such an incredible moron,

03:09.815 --> 03:12.650
this might have been challenging for me.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.069
To think The Mage was scared of you.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.362
He was?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.531
You're nothing but small people,

03:18.532 --> 03:23.203
just more small people standing in my way.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.747
Not today.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.332
I get The Boy,

03:27.333 --> 03:30.043
I get Wendimoor,

03:30.044 --> 03:31.419
and for once,

03:31.420 --> 03:33.004
I get the last word,

03:33.005 --> 03:34.465
'cause--

03:35.424 --> 03:37.050
The Trosts are headed to attack.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.927
Silas, your mother needs you.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.678
You get to her, and
you stop this madness!

03:40.679 --> 03:42.096
But the prophecy, The Boy!

03:42.097 --> 03:43.181
There is no time!

03:43.182 --> 03:44.891
We'll fulfill the prophecy, Silas.

03:44.892 --> 03:45.934
Go to your family.

03:45.935 --> 03:46.976
Stop the fight before it's too late.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.897
Uh... Bad stuff!

03:50.898 --> 03:53.066
Boxheads! They're coming!

03:53.067 --> 03:54.067
Go, everyone!

03:54.068 --> 03:55.360
We need the pool.

03:55.361 --> 03:56.277
I know another way.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.195
Let's go!

03:57.196 --> 03:58.279
Boys!

03:58.280 --> 03:59.739
Go!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.699
I won't leave you to die, Wygar.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.244
Go!

04:05.663 --> 04:06.579
Wygar!

04:06.580 --> 04:07.706
Run, boy!

04:09.416 --> 04:11.542
Go!

04:11.543 --> 04:13.212
Save your family!

04:16.257 --> 04:18.341
No, no, no...

04:18.342 --> 04:19.343
Keep moving!

04:20.344 --> 04:21.594
You silly man.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.096
Go on, get up!

04:23.097 --> 04:24.722
Who do you think you're dealing with?

04:24.723 --> 04:27.141
You think you can shut me up?

04:27.142 --> 04:28.143
No!

04:28.727 --> 04:31.521
Nobody tells me what to do!

04:31.522 --> 04:32.856
Not anymore!

04:34.733 --> 04:36.068
Avaratos!

04:45.494 --> 04:46.411
Come on!

04:46.412 --> 04:47.413
Okay!

05:09.727 --> 05:11.854
Oh, yes, my queen.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.398
Our armies are entering the Valley

05:15.399 --> 05:16.859
at this very moment.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.860
We stand at the ready.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.236
Shall we pursue them?

05:20.237 --> 05:21.571
The ones that got away?

05:21.572 --> 05:22.697
No.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.115
<i>Forget about them.</i>

05:24.116 --> 05:26.284
<i>They've got no magic, no pool,</i>

05:26.285 --> 05:27.744
<i>they'll never get to The Boy.</i>

05:27.745 --> 05:29.954
<i>They're just little flies,</i>

05:29.955 --> 05:31.915
<i>buzzing around my head.</i>

05:33.959 --> 05:36.128
I'll have fun with them later.

05:36.879 --> 05:39.714
Have the last of the families killed.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.341
I'm sick of them.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.218
Of course, my queen.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.891
This is my world now.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.854
I'm going to fix everything.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.358
All righty. This is our target.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.694
Remember, stay calm.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.197
Project Lamia isn't normally violent,

06:04.198 --> 06:07.158
but she is dangerous if provoked.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.453
Do not take action unless ordered.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.880
It's... gone, man!

06:20.881 --> 06:22.173
The-the-the...

06:22.174 --> 06:23.299
thingie is gone, man!

06:23.300 --> 06:24.635
Stay calm!

06:25.636 --> 06:26.469
That's not calm.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.470
Where are you?

06:27.471 --> 06:29.347
Calm. Okay?

06:29.348 --> 06:31.057
We don't even know
that she's in this room.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.767
Yeah, but we don't know
that she's, like,

06:32.768 --> 06:34.060
not in this room either, right?

06:34.061 --> 06:36.604
Like, she could've already
morphed into something!

06:37.981 --> 06:38.856
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:38.857 --> 06:40.234
Whoa! Whoa!

06:41.193 --> 06:42.902
Look, for all we know,

06:42.903 --> 06:45.863
Mona Wilder is just a couple of molecules

06:45.864 --> 06:48.074
that can modify the matter around her.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.826
I don't understand that!

06:49.827 --> 06:54.997
You're not going to be able to shoot her,

06:54.998 --> 06:56.082
so just--

06:56.083 --> 06:57.083
Wait!

06:57.084 --> 06:59.919
What if she's already, like,
transformed into somebody?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.254
What if she's already loose
in the facility?

07:01.255 --> 07:03.089
I--

07:03.090 --> 07:04.174
Whoa!

07:05.175 --> 07:07.385
It's you, isn't it?

07:07.386 --> 07:08.803
She's you.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.264
Or wait, no, you're Mona.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.099
You're Mona,
and you don't even know.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.936
No. No! I'm Ken!

07:16.937 --> 07:18.187
I need to shoot you to be sure.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.313
Why would that help?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.524
I don't know.
It's a thought I had, so I have to do it!

07:21.525 --> 07:22.943
But you just-- Wait, wait!

07:24.736 --> 07:26.487
Your gun...

07:26.488 --> 07:27.489
Huh?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.701
Your gun

07:31.702 --> 07:33.244
is still in the holster.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.246
Huh?

07:39.293 --> 07:40.711
Oh, shit.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.255
Uh...

07:45.549 --> 07:47.217
Stand... stand down!

07:49.219 --> 07:50.678
Stand down, stand-stand down...

07:50.679 --> 07:52.139
Stand... stand down...

07:55.476 --> 07:57.268
Hi, Mona.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.561
I'm Ken.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.063
We haven't met yet,

08:01.690 --> 08:03.649
but I'm here to help.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.944
I think there's been a big
misunderstanding, Mona.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.363
Now, no one wants to hurt you.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.823
No, no.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.743
I know that you helped Dirk escape

08:13.744 --> 08:15.661
because he was... he was your friend.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.331
Well, I want to be your friend too.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.832
Look, I think Dirk is in trouble,

08:19.833 --> 08:24.045
but we can't do anything
without your help.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.255
Can you help us, Mona?

08:26.256 --> 08:29.634
You don't want to hurt anyone...

08:29.635 --> 08:30.719
Right?

08:36.475 --> 08:38.185
Hello?

08:40.938 --> 08:41.939
Hi.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.652
Tina?

08:47.653 --> 08:48.986
Yeah.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.404
Are you okay?

08:50.405 --> 08:51.864
Yeah.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.699
It's not bleeding.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.910
It just burns.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.706
Now, where'd he go?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.718
He's back down by the car.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.012
And...

09:18.475 --> 09:19.475
Oh, my God...

09:19.476 --> 09:20.476
Hey, Hobbs!

09:20.477 --> 09:21.352
Shh!

09:21.353 --> 09:22.311
What are you--

09:22.312 --> 09:24.605
Stop it! It won't work.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.690
He's...

09:25.691 --> 09:28.734
He's enchanted, like Bob Boreton.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.195
What do we do?

09:31.863 --> 09:34.615
We have to go down there and get him.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.575
"Get him"?

09:35.576 --> 09:38.245
Look, whatever he's doing,
it's not good.

09:39.037 --> 09:42.248
And I am not losing two fights

09:42.249 --> 09:43.749
in one year.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.792
We need a plan.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.003
A plan.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.255
Right.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.507
Yes.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.759
Let's arrest that son of a bitch.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.969
Yeah.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.271
Ow.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.315
Okay.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.401
We're both gonna die.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.374
All right, boys and girls,
this is a special situation.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.711
Everybody just relax, follow my lead.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.339
Priest to Command.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.634
Yoo-hoo.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.261
<i>Hello, high Command.</i>

10:38.013 --> 10:39.306
Anybody home?

10:42.726 --> 10:45.061
Priest, this is Command.

10:45.062 --> 10:45.936
<i>Hold on, now.</i>

10:45.937 --> 10:48.105
Is that my friend Ken?

10:48.106 --> 10:49.815
Yes, it is, Mr. Priest.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.401
Well, isn't that music to my ears?

10:52.402 --> 10:55.906
<i>Aren't you the one who survived alone
with Project Marzanna?</i>

10:57.366 --> 11:00.618
That's me. Why?

11:00.619 --> 11:01.786
Well...

11:01.787 --> 11:05.749
I am in need of your expertise
at the moment.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.132
Ho boy.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.884
Who are these men?

11:16.885 --> 11:18.178
Are they warriors?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.597
It's Blackwing.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.682
This could get ugly.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.559
They're gonna want me
to come with them.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.144
If you don't want to go,

11:27.145 --> 11:28.729
then I shan't let them take you.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.066
Panto, you don't
know these guys.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.194
I mean, they're dangerous,
they hurt people.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.446
I appreciate your concern, Bartine,

11:37.447 --> 11:40.783
but I am the greatest swordsman
in all of Wendimoor.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.285
I suspect I'll be all right.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.580
Yeah, okay.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.250
Guns down, everybody.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.253
Clips on the ground.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.381
We are not risking
a chain reaction here.

11:55.382 --> 11:59.093
Your weapons will not be useful.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.970
They'll just give her a reason to kill us all.

12:00.971 --> 12:02.431
Let's avoid that.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.604
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

12:11.773 --> 12:13.983
How you doin', Bart?

12:13.984 --> 12:16.569
Hi, Mr. Priest.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.696
Uh...

12:19.156 --> 12:23.075
You don't feel like
killing anybody right now,

12:23.076 --> 12:24.493
right?

12:24.494 --> 12:26.037
No, not really.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.666
We just wanna go to Wendimoor
for the big happy ending.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.335
Okay. Sure. Who's your buddy?

12:33.336 --> 12:36.088
Verily, I am a normal man,

12:36.089 --> 12:37.298
from this world,

12:37.299 --> 12:39.176
much like yourself.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.053
Okay.

12:43.054 --> 12:46.140
Priest, we're gonna
wanna go into the house.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.683
Are you gonna try to stop us?

12:47.684 --> 12:50.686
No, ma'am. I can't make you
do anything you don't want to do,

12:50.687 --> 12:52.355
I know that. But...

12:53.648 --> 12:56.734
there is somebody...

12:56.735 --> 12:58.195
who wants to say hi.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.363
Oh, my God, Bart!

13:02.574 --> 13:04.575
Ken! Hi!

13:05.869 --> 13:08.120
Oh, my God.
There you are!

13:08.121 --> 13:11.248
Hey, you're on some kind of little... square?

13:11.249 --> 13:12.708
How did you get in there?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.460
Hey, are you on TV?

13:14.461 --> 13:17.421
No, Bart, I'm at Blackwing.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.257
I'm okay, it's just a video.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.885
Hey, I'm sorry I left you.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.637
There was all this shooting.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.846
I just, I didn't want you to get hurt.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.473
That's all okay now.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.517
They're taking good care of me.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.394
Hey, how do I get you out of there?

13:32.062 --> 13:34.980
Well, okay, that's the thing, Bart,

13:34.981 --> 13:36.524
you don't have to.

13:36.525 --> 13:37.858
I don't?

13:37.859 --> 13:39.485
No.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.655
But what you could do is come in,

13:42.656 --> 13:44.824
back in.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.283
What?

13:46.284 --> 13:47.451
Why?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.036
Blackwing is terrible.

13:49.037 --> 13:52.289
I mean, it's the most boring place
I've ever been to in my whole life.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.916
No, it's different now.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.459
I'm here--

13:55.460 --> 13:57.545
Yeah, but I'm different too.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.841
Hey, I don't even
kill anybody anymore.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.301
You just dropped a chainsaw.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.596
Oh, no, I-I just like it.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.139
Well, bring it with you, then.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.100
I've missed you, Bart.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.935
Hey, you should come with us!

14:12.936 --> 14:14.645
<i>You should come to Wendimoor!</i>

14:14.646 --> 14:16.939
<i>I can't do that.</i>

14:16.940 --> 14:18.774
Come and see me, Bart.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.776
I'm your friend.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.736
You have to trust me.

14:22.737 --> 14:23.780
Yeah...

14:25.657 --> 14:28.409
Yeah, but Panto is my friend too.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.995
This is Panto.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.206
You should listen to Ken.
He's only trying to help you.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.166
So am I.

14:36.167 --> 14:39.254
We have been through
a lot together, huh?

14:40.297 --> 14:41.881
<i>Why don't you come back in?</i>

14:41.882 --> 14:44.717
Look, we can even stop
and get some ice cream,

14:44.718 --> 14:46.511
just like old times.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.764
See, Bart, I'm your friend too.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.561
No, I don't think you are.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.648
Panto, come on.

14:59.608 --> 15:00.650
Bart...

15:04.946 --> 15:06.488
Come on.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.449
Hey, Ken, I'm really sorry,

15:08.450 --> 15:10.702
but I'm gonna go. 'Kay, bye.

15:11.453 --> 15:12.537
<i>Bart...</i>

15:15.332 --> 15:16.498
No, no, no, hey, hey,

15:16.499 --> 15:17.458
whoa, whoa, whoa, Bart.

15:17.459 --> 15:18.626
hold on a minute.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.085
Unhand the lady.

15:20.086 --> 15:20.961
Right.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.588
Right you are.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.716
On the list of things
I'm not doing today, Priest,

15:25.717 --> 15:27.802
going back to Blackwing
is near the top.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.762
Think it over.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.096
She said she doesn't want to go.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.723
There's no more left to discuss.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.059
Now, stand aside.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.523
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:41.524 --> 15:43.025
Whoa, whoa!

15:43.026 --> 15:44.235
Stand down! Hold on!

15:48.865 --> 15:49.782
Stand down!

15:49.783 --> 15:50.824
What is it?

15:50.825 --> 15:52.285
What's happening?

15:54.162 --> 15:55.288
Stand down!

16:03.922 --> 16:05.006
Wow!

16:09.427 --> 16:11.887
We don't wanna kill any more people.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.975
We just wanna go to Wendimoor
for the happily ever after.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.602
I'm not going to let that happen, Bart.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.653
Panto?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.907
Shit.
Everybody stand down!

16:35.370 --> 16:36.745
Hey!

16:36.746 --> 16:38.831
Are you sure you don't wanna
come to Wendimoor?

16:38.832 --> 16:41.208
Bart, listen to me!

16:41.209 --> 16:42.960
Okay, well, listen, Ken,

16:42.961 --> 16:45.171
you let me know
if you change your mind, okay?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.092
Bart!

16:50.093 --> 16:51.218
Wait! Stop!

16:51.219 --> 16:52.761
Come on.

16:52.762 --> 16:53.721
Sorry about the mess.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.974
<i>Bart, wait! Bart! Stop! Wait!</i>

17:02.564 --> 17:05.483
'Sway!
Ome'lgo, wayfumtebadduns!

17:07.318 --> 17:11.363
Wait, so the pool in the throne room
leads to the bed?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.157
Possibly. The bed led to the pool.

17:13.158 --> 17:14.658
Drummer pulled us through a pool.

17:14.659 --> 17:15.826
I got a lake.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.328
Shouldn't the pool in the throne room
work the same way as Wakti's?

17:18.329 --> 17:19.538
Absolutely.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.707
And by that I mean,
possibly, sure. Maybe?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.459
We have no way of knowing that.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.376
How'd that truck get through?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.586
Same pool?

17:25.587 --> 17:27.129
We really have no idea
how any of this works.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.214
You gonna pull that guy you need
through a pool?

17:29.215 --> 17:30.591
Drummer's got the power.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.010
Wait, wait a second, Amanda,
you know how to do this?

17:33.011 --> 17:34.720
You said you needed Wakti's help.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.846
Well, I have to try.

17:35.847 --> 17:39.600
Dirk, do I have to reach through the pool
to find The Boy in Blackwing?

17:39.601 --> 17:41.351
<i>Because I don't know where he is in there.</i>

17:41.352 --> 17:42.728
Okay, then let's do this,

17:42.729 --> 17:45.064
if you can get me and the Rowdy 3 in,

17:45.065 --> 17:47.483
we'll be like a super action-boy strike team.

17:47.484 --> 17:48.734
Jailbreak.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.902
Look, let's just take a beat here--

17:49.903 --> 17:51.779
- There's no time!
- We can't, dude!

17:51.780 --> 17:53.697
You want to portal into
Blackwing to get The Boy?

17:53.698 --> 17:55.574
Suzie Boreton is here
destroying everything.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.784
There's an army coming!

17:56.785 --> 17:59.078
- Yeah, that actually was kinda a lot of guys.
- Shitloads bigtime.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.788
There's 11,000 dudes.
I counted real quick.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.039
This is crazy!

18:02.040 --> 18:04.083
I know I said
we needed to take control,

18:04.084 --> 18:06.085
but what if the universe
is not on our side this time?

18:06.086 --> 18:08.337
- Aw...
- We need a real plan.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.464
Did we really come all this way
just so we could all get--

18:10.465 --> 18:12.091
Ah! God!

18:12.092 --> 18:13.133
Todd?

18:16.930 --> 18:17.972
Is he...?

18:19.641 --> 18:20.849
Are you having an attack?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.227
Yeah.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.436
M--My pills!

18:24.437 --> 18:25.771
- Late lunch, gentlemen?
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.814
No, hold up.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.023
Don't help him.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.566
- What?!
- Todd, listen.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.277
Remember how I said
pararibulitus works differently here?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.321
Well, it feels the same.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.281
I know, but just listen to me.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.658
You can beat this.
You can use the energy.

18:37.659 --> 18:38.700
Turn what's hurting you--

18:38.701 --> 18:40.494
Barbed wire on my leg.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.247
Right.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.457
Barbed wire.
You can make the barbed wire real.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.751
You can pull it off your leg,
and it won't hurt you.

18:47.752 --> 18:48.669
You just have to listen to me.

18:49.838 --> 18:50.963
Don't panic.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.257
It's your wire, it belongs to you,

18:53.258 --> 18:54.425
it's your pain.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.676
I need my pills.

18:55.677 --> 18:56.970
Hey, look at me!

18:57.387 --> 18:58.720
The energy is yours,

18:58.721 --> 18:59.930
the fear is yours,

18:59.931 --> 19:02.641
the barbed wire is yours,
so control them.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.726
Separate yourself
from the physical space.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.855
You own this. You control this.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.485
Ooh, damn...

19:13.486 --> 19:16.822
God, Todd, you've got
barbed wire on your leg!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.032
You can see it?

19:31.296 --> 19:32.463
Nicely done.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.467
Holy shit.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.201
Hello... Mona.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.412
My name's Supervisor Friedkin.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.040
How's your neck?

20:08.041 --> 20:11.418
It's... bad, actually.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.295
You really hurt me.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.048
I'm sorry.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.134
You were scaring me.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.972
Just like those men
are scaring me now.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.559
Well, they need
to be here right now,

20:27.560 --> 20:28.977
in case you, like,

20:28.978 --> 20:31.189
turn into a bear or something.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.944
Why would I turn into a silly little bear?

20:37.528 --> 20:39.738
If I wanted to kill you,

20:39.739 --> 20:43.742
I'd just turn into
an aircraft carrier right now,

20:43.743 --> 20:46.996
and this entire place
would be destroyed.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.917
Please don't do that.

20:54.629 --> 20:55.754
Hi, Mona!

20:55.755 --> 20:57.257
Chair, please.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.426
- Get up.
- Sure.

21:02.178 --> 21:05.055
Can I see Dirk?

21:05.056 --> 21:07.766
Not right now.
He's in some trouble.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.643
Oh no.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.812
Trouble is bad.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.816
Yes, it is.
But you can help.

21:15.900 --> 21:19.236
I don't want to hurt anyone.

21:19.237 --> 21:22.155
I'm just an actress.

21:22.156 --> 21:25.909
I'm a holistic actress.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.787
I can play any role.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.331
Why were you the toy?

21:33.584 --> 21:37.504
I can be anything.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.423
A boat,

21:39.424 --> 21:41.174
or a house,

21:41.175 --> 21:42.884
or a shovel,

21:42.885 --> 21:44.803
<i>or a cloud,</i>

21:44.804 --> 21:47.806
<i>or an old Pakistani man,</i>

21:47.807 --> 21:49.725
<i>or the Queen of England,</i>

21:49.726 --> 21:51.810
or a kangaroo...

21:51.811 --> 21:54.980
but I don't know
what I am supposed to be.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.898
Why did you send Dirk away?

21:56.899 --> 21:59.651
I didn't do that.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.778
I just told him what the voice said.

22:01.779 --> 22:02.780
The...

22:03.573 --> 22:05.198
The... the voice?

22:05.199 --> 22:06.867
One day

22:06.868 --> 22:08.910
there was a voice.

22:08.911 --> 22:11.371
A funny little snail voice.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.498
What did this voice say?

22:13.499 --> 22:15.042
She said

22:15.043 --> 22:18.962
she needed Dirk
to help find her friend,

22:18.963 --> 22:20.339
a boy.

22:20.340 --> 22:23.759
<i>She said if I let her use my eyes,</i>

22:23.760 --> 22:26.721
<i>she could put people
where they needed to be.</i>

22:28.598 --> 22:30.558
So she saw what you saw.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.062
Yes.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.275
Does that help? Did I help Dirk?

22:40.276 --> 22:41.568
Oh yeah. Yeah.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.653
<i>Very much.</i>

22:43.654 --> 22:46.199
Do I have to stay a person now?

22:46.824 --> 22:49.201
Only for a little while longer,

22:49.202 --> 22:51.411
if you don't mind.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.163
Okay.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.874
<i>I guess that's all nice.</i>

22:56.542 --> 22:57.876
Uh...

22:57.877 --> 23:00.337
Thank you, Mona.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.548
You're a great friend.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.100
Panto!

23:13.101 --> 23:14.351
Look at that moon!

23:14.352 --> 23:15.812
Have you seen this moon?

23:16.604 --> 23:19.023
Yes, Bart, that's quite
a normal moon to me.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.691
Oh, buddy,

23:21.692 --> 23:25.028
I'm starting to think
you're a little weird, you know that?

23:25.029 --> 23:26.988
Imagine how I felt
in your strange world,

23:26.989 --> 23:29.408
with your dumb little moon
looking all tiny.

23:29.409 --> 23:31.284
Yeah, I guess the moon
is pretty stupid,

23:31.285 --> 23:32.745
now that I think about it.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.376
Hey, Panto?

23:39.377 --> 23:41.711
I wanna go this way.
Can we go this way?

23:41.712 --> 23:44.756
But Bart, my home is this way.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.800
Please, I beg of you, let's just--

23:52.181 --> 23:53.266
Panto?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.019
Silas!

24:02.984 --> 24:05.026
My love!

24:05.027 --> 24:06.903
You've returned.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.572
And I've found Dirk Gently.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.198
I found Dirk Gently.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.700
Is he here?

24:11.701 --> 24:12.576
Yes.

24:12.577 --> 24:14.786
Yes, but so is The Mage's apprentice.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.329
She's taken control of his men.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.666
Wow, that's bad.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.294
Hello?

24:21.711 --> 24:23.336
Hi.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.047
You're Silas, right?

24:26.090 --> 24:28.176
I heard about you.
Your mom's an asshole.

24:30.178 --> 24:32.971
Silas, this is Bartine,

24:32.972 --> 24:36.100
an exquisite creature
and a wonderful friend.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.102
Delighted to meet you,

24:39.103 --> 24:42.898
but we must hurry to my mother
and beg her to lay down her arms.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.317
Things have gotten worse,

24:45.318 --> 24:46.903
worse than you can ever imagine.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.867
Hey, that's the way
I wanted to go in the first place.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.710
I found The Boy.

25:05.338 --> 25:09.675
Those idiots told me
exactly where he was.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.929
Wendimoor is mine,

25:13.930 --> 25:16.516
except for one tiny little thread.

25:18.351 --> 25:21.478
You will travel to my world

25:21.479 --> 25:22.730
and cut it!

25:24.524 --> 25:26.066
How will we find The Boy?

25:26.067 --> 25:27.527
Shouldn't be too hard.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.945
Just go through here,

25:29.946 --> 25:32.406
and kill everyone you see!

26:09.610 --> 26:11.653
Ken, hey, I think I'm a little--

26:11.654 --> 26:14.239
I'm confused. What's going on?

26:14.240 --> 26:17.367
Project Moloch is a reality editor, all right?

26:17.368 --> 26:20.537
He can create things,
completely new things,

26:20.538 --> 26:22.956
from nothing but his mind, all right?

26:22.957 --> 26:26.961
Like the crazy funhouse hidden inside
the Cardenas farm in Bergsberg.

26:27.712 --> 26:32.465
The file said that he had plans
on building a much bigger world than that,

26:32.466 --> 26:34.217
called Wendimoor,

26:34.218 --> 26:36.386
like a fairytale land.

26:36.387 --> 26:39.347
I'm guessing
he actually pulled it off,

26:39.348 --> 26:40.932
and that's what put him in the coma.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.143
You with me?

26:43.728 --> 26:44.729
Yes.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.230
When he had
his stroke two months ago,

26:47.231 --> 26:50.025
it must have caused some kind
of thinning between worlds,

26:50.026 --> 26:52.694
and an entity from the other side,
this "voice,"

26:52.695 --> 26:54.362
poked through and found Mona.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.782
But wait, why are they looking for Dirk?

26:58.868 --> 27:00.661
To help them somehow.

27:01.829 --> 27:05.457
What matters now is that
we lock down this entire facility before--

27:05.458 --> 27:07.334
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, um...

27:07.335 --> 27:11.004
you keep acting
like you're in charge now.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.255
We don't have time for this.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.382
No, I just want to make sure
that you understand

27:14.383 --> 27:18.345
that you are helping me.

27:18.346 --> 27:20.139
I'm in charge.

27:21.349 --> 27:25.644
Hugo, you gave me
the same clearance as you.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.314
We are equals within this program.

27:29.357 --> 27:32.109
You can't take that away from me now.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.113
I...

27:37.114 --> 27:38.657
I didn't mean to do that.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.867
Wait! Look! Listen!

27:40.868 --> 27:43.203
We have to take control
of this situation,

27:43.204 --> 27:46.748
or this whole operation
is going to be compromised!

27:46.749 --> 27:47.874
Wait, that's...

27:50.419 --> 27:51.712
...my dog.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.218
Knights are coming!

27:57.677 --> 27:59.637
Knights are coming!

27:59.887 --> 28:01.806
Knights are coming!

28:03.808 --> 28:05.558
Secure Project Moloch!

28:05.559 --> 28:06.602
Now!

28:20.533 --> 28:22.368
Move! Move! Move!

28:25.079 --> 28:26.789
This way! Let's go!

28:48.018 --> 28:51.146
Bergsberg Sheriff's Department!
Put your hands up!

28:51.147 --> 28:52.856
Golly gee, well done!

28:52.857 --> 28:54.691
You got down here in...

28:54.692 --> 28:57.819
record time, really, I can't believe it.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.491
You think I didn't know you were there?

29:04.410 --> 29:06.619
Oh no, it's the police!

29:06.620 --> 29:08.705
Sneaking up on me...

29:08.706 --> 29:09.914
Oh, ladies,

29:09.915 --> 29:12.292
that's an incredibly
foolhardy attempt at a...

29:12.293 --> 29:13.501
what, an ambush?

29:13.502 --> 29:15.920
<i>That's hilarious.</i>

29:15.921 --> 29:18.841
Well, I guess you needed
some sort of plan, but this...?

29:20.092 --> 29:22.802
Well, you were always a disappointment,
weren't you, Farah Black?

29:22.803 --> 29:24.179
You don't scare me!

29:24.180 --> 29:26.347
If only your father could see you now.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.600
<i>He'd hardly be surprised, would he?</i>

29:28.601 --> 29:31.227
<i>Family full of heroes.</i>

29:31.228 --> 29:33.313
Someone had
to drop the ball eventually.

29:33.314 --> 29:35.273
I suppose he always knew
it would be you.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.274
Drop the wand!

29:36.275 --> 29:37.902
Don't be absurd.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.905
Do you want to see something funny?

29:49.079 --> 29:52.081
Those little pokes with my needle
appear to have put you

29:52.082 --> 29:54.167
into a rather
negative state of mind, ladies.

29:54.168 --> 29:56.211
What do we do,
what do we do, what do we do?

29:56.212 --> 29:58.463
Shh... shh.

29:58.464 --> 30:02.634
Now, I could just have you
kill each other right now,

30:02.635 --> 30:04.011
or...

30:05.137 --> 30:07.640
we could try something
with a little more mischief.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.022
Hobbs!

30:16.023 --> 30:17.650
Hobbs, it's me! It's Tina!

30:18.901 --> 30:20.109
Stay calm--

30:20.110 --> 30:21.361
What are you making him do?

30:21.362 --> 30:23.738
Well, he's helping me
with a little project.

30:23.739 --> 30:26.074
You see, we're going
to take this car,

30:26.075 --> 30:29.160
fill it full of explosives,
and then Mr. Hobbs is going to

30:29.161 --> 30:33.748
drive it into that silly old house
with the gateway to Wendimoor.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.708
And pwoosh!

30:35.709 --> 30:37.669
Blow it to bits.

30:37.670 --> 30:42.006
Lots of burny little bits,
house, barn, all of it.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.802
No more road to that cursed land,

30:45.803 --> 30:48.429
and a fresh new start for me.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.473
Mr. Hobbs!

30:50.474 --> 30:53.102
Take out your gun and aim it at them.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.438
Sherlock, don't!
What are you doing?

30:57.439 --> 31:00.109
Hobbs? Listen to me,

31:01.026 --> 31:02.319
we're your friends.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.698
Now, this is the kind of game I really enjoy!

31:06.699 --> 31:08.658
I was never meant to be a conqueror,

31:08.659 --> 31:10.535
taking over the world.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.495
I much prefer to hurt people in person,

31:12.496 --> 31:15.456
not send an army in
to burn down a village.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.791
Where's the fun in that?

31:16.792 --> 31:18.251
Hobbs...

31:18.252 --> 31:19.586
It's so...

31:19.587 --> 31:20.962
impersonal.

31:20.963 --> 31:22.881
But this...

31:22.882 --> 31:24.465
it's fun-tastic!

31:25.634 --> 31:27.260
Shoot them, Hobbs.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.345
Ah!

31:31.557 --> 31:32.975
No, no, no, no--

31:56.624 --> 31:59.043
Oh, God... Farah, I'm sorry!

32:04.256 --> 32:06.466
No one in Wendimoor can defeat me!

32:06.467 --> 32:08.385
You're not in Wendimoor!

32:28.739 --> 32:30.115
Ow!

32:35.371 --> 32:37.247
What the heck happened?

32:49.843 --> 32:51.803
Father, stop!

32:51.804 --> 32:53.846
My God,
what's happened here?

32:53.847 --> 32:55.390
Mother!

32:55.391 --> 32:56.474
Father...

32:56.475 --> 32:57.601
Silas!

32:59.937 --> 33:01.646
Panto...

33:01.647 --> 33:03.481
you're alive.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.608
What have you done, Father?

33:05.609 --> 33:07.860
What has become
of our beloved homeland?

33:07.861 --> 33:09.530
We are doomed, my boy.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.949
Even after all this death,

33:12.950 --> 33:15.535
we can still save
the Valley of Inglenook.

33:15.536 --> 33:20.039
Please, Father, Lady Frija,
we must salvage something.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.375
Silas, how...?

33:22.376 --> 33:23.544
Mother...

33:26.171 --> 33:27.673
I'm in love with him.

33:33.387 --> 33:34.596
Huh.

33:35.681 --> 33:36.931
Is it true?

33:36.932 --> 33:38.225
It is, Father.

33:42.229 --> 33:45.648
If there is to be any hope
for a future in this land,

33:45.649 --> 33:48.985
you must wake up and stop this.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.570
Please.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.865
We cannot bear more destruction.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.535
So many have died...

33:58.078 --> 34:01.122
Their sacrifice
does not have to be in vain.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.915
We can honor them yet

34:02.916 --> 34:05.001
if we work together
to save Inglenook.

34:05.002 --> 34:06.210
You see?

34:06.211 --> 34:08.005
Everything is gonna work out great.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.428
Ha ha! They all killed each other!

34:15.429 --> 34:17.180
There's no one left for us to kill!

34:23.187 --> 34:24.188
But--

34:24.730 --> 34:26.314
Silas!

34:28.192 --> 34:29.193
Panto?

34:30.069 --> 34:32.905
Panto... Panto?

35:24.206 --> 35:25.874
Odere! Odere!

35:26.750 --> 35:28.043
Dere!

35:38.512 --> 35:39.929
Okay...

35:39.930 --> 35:41.139
Okay.

35:41.140 --> 35:42.474
You got this, boss?

35:44.351 --> 35:47.436
Sure. Yeah.

35:47.437 --> 35:49.147
Why not? Yeah, mm-hmm.

35:49.148 --> 35:50.857
Sure.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.568
What do you want us to do?

35:53.735 --> 35:54.862
Just step back.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.667
Wow...

36:09.668 --> 36:10.877
She can really do that.

36:10.878 --> 36:13.504
Yes, she can.

36:15.841 --> 36:16.883
That was incredible.

36:16.884 --> 36:17.967
Are you okay?

36:17.968 --> 36:19.051
Yeah.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.596
Yeah, I just... I can't keep it open.

36:21.597 --> 36:22.972
Wh... wh... what do you need?

36:22.973 --> 36:24.682
It's too much by myself.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.642
I haven't done it without Wakti.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.895
I needed more time with her.

36:28.896 --> 36:31.731
I could maybe get you there, Dirk,
like, one way?

36:31.732 --> 36:33.024
But then you'd be stuck,

36:33.025 --> 36:34.567
and I don't know
if I could get you back.

36:34.568 --> 36:37.069
That seems... not great.

36:37.905 --> 36:39.864
Bah sheps comfur...

36:39.865 --> 36:43.534
- Y-you guys?
- Ledee! Ledee!

36:43.535 --> 36:45.203
Wait, Todd!

36:45.204 --> 36:46.454
You can help me.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.040
What? No, I can't do that.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.249
I'm not like you.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.376
No, you're not. But...

36:52.377 --> 36:54.212
you can maybe use your energy,

36:54.213 --> 36:56.589
and it would help me
keep the portal open?

36:56.590 --> 36:58.341
You just have to try.

36:58.342 --> 37:01.594
Guys, rainbow monster's trying to tell us
something bad's coming!

37:05.766 --> 37:07.683
Bad sheps ledee!

37:07.684 --> 37:08.643
Suzi.

37:08.644 --> 37:10.144
Okay, yes, just--

37:10.145 --> 37:11.854
whatever you say, just...

37:11.855 --> 37:12.855
I'll do it, I'm in.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.732
We'll slow that witch down.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.902
- Boys?
- I got nothin' but rocks in here!

37:17.903 --> 37:18.986
Nobody makes me scared of laughter!

37:18.987 --> 37:19.988
Wait!

37:21.031 --> 37:23.199
Dirk and I need the Rowdy 3
to come through with us.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.160
You can't help me keep the portal open
and go through.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.286
Shit, but then--

37:27.287 --> 37:29.665
It's... it's all right.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.084
I'll do it alone.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.211
You seriously want
to go back to Blackwing by yourself?

37:35.212 --> 37:38.214
"Want" may be
a strong word, Todd, but--

37:38.215 --> 37:40.925
<i>Where are you going,
Dirk Gently?</i>

37:40.926 --> 37:42.635
"Want" truly is a strong word,

37:42.636 --> 37:44.262
and yet no other more
perspicuous appellations

37:44.263 --> 37:47.265
are currently traveling to my mind
with any degree of alacrity

37:47.266 --> 37:48.891
to allow me to concisely articulate--

37:48.892 --> 37:50.686
Dirk, stop with the... words.

37:51.561 --> 37:53.437
Don't spin out. You can do this.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.439
Okay.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.858
There's a lotta weird in here!

38:06.201 --> 38:08.911
So, I'm gonna have an attack?

38:08.912 --> 38:09.829
Yeah.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.039
Probably a bad, slow one?

38:12.040 --> 38:13.041
Yup.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.502
Perfect. I'm in.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.379
Just... tell me what to do.

38:18.380 --> 38:21.550
Keep your hands in, no matter what.

38:24.261 --> 38:25.262
Dirk?

38:26.179 --> 38:27.222
Are you ready?

38:32.269 --> 38:33.478
Yes.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.898
I can do this.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.917
Don't panic.
