about Buck?

might've--

19:25.498 --> 19:29.575
I told you that my parents
were not bad people.

19:29.652 --> 19:32.420
All right, just--
they're just bad parents.

19:34.749 --> 19:37.416
What if I'm more like them
than I think?

19:37.568 --> 19:38.718
You're not.

19:39.904 --> 19:41.754
Look.

19:41.923 --> 19:43.681
I don't know them.

19:43.925 --> 19:45.908
But I know you.

19:45.927 --> 19:48.853
I know us, and...
(chuckles)

19:48.930 --> 19:50.596
Yeah, we're gonna
make mistakes,

19:50.748 --> 19:51.747
but they're gonna forgive us

19:51.933 --> 19:54.734
because they'll know how much
we love them.

19:58.773 --> 20:01.699

a really great dad.

20:01.776 --> 20:03.609

Karen is at the supermarket.

21:10.678 --> 21:13.329

21:28.195 --> 21:29.269
Show me your room, Nia?

21:29.347 --> 21:31.289
-Sure.
-Come on, let's go look.

21:31.440 --> 21:32.439

21:32.458 --> 21:34.608

-I'll get it.

21:34.627 --> 21:38.212
Little man, you have to stop
opening the door to strangers.

21:39.690 --> 21:41.281
Sydney?

21:41.359 --> 21:42.783
Someone wrote
on this child's face.

21:42.860 --> 21:43.950
Do you know how to get it off?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.285
Uh, I don't know.

21:45.363 --> 21:46.304
Maybe try nail polish remover.

21:46.455 --> 21:48.121
Do not listen to her.

21:48.199 --> 21:49.807
Start with soap and water,
okay?

21:49.958 --> 21:52.384
And if that doesn't work,
then we'll try baby oil next.

21:52.537 --> 21:53.227
Okay.

21:55.798 --> 21:56.647
What are you doing here?

21:56.965 --> 21:58.965
I wanted to talk.
About the other day.

21:59.134 --> 22:00.133
Now is not the time.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.894
And by the way, here's a tip.

22:01.970 --> 22:03.303
It is never the time
to just show up

22:03.323 --> 22:04.822
unannounced at my home.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.565
I really needed to talk to you.

22:06.642 --> 22:08.901
And I really need to get marker
off of my son's face

22:09.053 --> 22:10.903
and figure out what my daughter
is saying in the other room.

22:10.979 --> 22:12.404
How many kids do you have?

22:12.481 --> 22:13.906
What are you still doing here?

22:14.075 --> 22:17.150
Look, I saw Dr. Langford
yesterday,

22:17.228 --> 22:19.745
and he asked
if everything was okay.

22:19.822 --> 22:21.154
Between us.

22:21.232 --> 22:23.065
And I told him it was,
so if he asks you,

22:23.084 --> 22:25.826
you have to say the same thing.

22:25.994 --> 22:28.237
And that's why you're standing
on my doorstep at 8:00 a.m.?

22:28.255 --> 22:30.923
First I fainted,
then you got all weird with me.

22:31.092 --> 22:32.091
It's put me on Dr. Langford's

22:32.243 --> 22:33.592
radar for all
the wrong reasons.

22:33.744 --> 22:37.021
I can't afford to look this bad
this early.

22:37.264 --> 22:39.190
Because it's all about you.

22:39.266 --> 22:42.026
Being a doctor
is really important to me.

22:42.177 --> 22:43.194
It's really important
to me too.

22:43.270 --> 22:45.846
Oh, please.
You gotta be what, 40?

22:45.923 --> 22:46.939
You've already got a job.

22:47.091 --> 22:48.107
You're married,
there's apparently

22:48.259 --> 22:50.016
at least two kids.

22:50.094 --> 22:51.202
There's no way
you can juggle all that.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.536
You can barely handle
a marker already.

22:52.613 --> 22:54.872
You don't know the first thing
about me.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.208
I know that I need
to be a doctor,

22:57.359 --> 22:59.025
and I just wanna be sure that
when you quit med school,

22:59.045 --> 23:00.360
you don't take my reputation
with you

23:00.380 --> 23:01.954
-on your way out the door.
-What, you--

23:02.030 --> 23:03.547

23:03.716 --> 23:04.632
Mama.

23:07.294 --> 23:08.386
Sorry to interrupt.

23:08.537 --> 23:11.430

Sydney was just leaving.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.561
-Karen will be back soon?
-HEN: Yeah.

23:17.713 --> 23:18.971
Why don't I, uh,

23:19.065 --> 23:21.065
why don't I make us some coffee
while we wait?

23:21.325 --> 23:22.474
Okay. All right.

24:40.963 --> 24:44.389
She said she was scared
of screwing up with our kid

24:44.542 --> 24:47.559
the way your parents screwed up
with the two of you guys.

24:47.728 --> 24:48.894
She said that?

24:48.971 --> 24:50.395
Kinda.

24:50.564 --> 24:52.397
I mean, she wasn't specific,
but she never is.

24:52.474 --> 24:54.733
She said that
they're not bad people,

24:54.810 --> 24:57.978
so I'm guessing that
they weren't abusive.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.738
No, no, they weren't.

24:59.815 --> 25:02.041
Um, they were just...

25:03.577 --> 25:05.294
Absent, you know?

25:07.248 --> 25:08.413
I mean, they were in the house,

25:08.582 --> 25:10.733
they were cooking meals,
washing clothes,

25:10.751 --> 25:13.052
usual stuff, just...

25:14.071 --> 25:15.254
It always felt like

25:15.406 --> 25:17.389
they were a million miles away.

25:18.576 --> 25:19.925
Well, that must've been weird.

25:20.094 --> 25:23.095
Ah, I just figured
they liked each other

25:23.247 --> 25:24.563
more than they liked us.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.583
Well, they--
they weren't great with kids.

25:27.676 --> 25:30.510
Okay, so I shouldn't be worried
that you guys are hiding

25:30.530 --> 25:33.364
some deep, dark,
Buckley family secret from me?

25:33.533 --> 25:34.757
Nah.

25:34.850 --> 25:37.701
Just your average

But you guys aren't in trouble
with the social worker.

25:51.366 --> 25:54.126
I explained the situation.

25:54.202 --> 25:56.554
She understood.
It was just a bad day.

25:56.705 --> 25:57.704
Mm.

25:57.798 --> 26:00.391

a full-time job,

26:30.314 --> 26:31.255
and medical school?

Where is this coming from?

26:33.317 --> 26:35.208
I'm just tired.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.338

of having to always prove

26:39.506 --> 26:42.491
that I belong, that I'm worthy.

26:42.660 --> 26:45.752
That I'm just as good
as the rest of them.

through medical school.

26:56.932 --> 26:59.366
You are formidable, my friend!

27:00.936 --> 27:03.037
I don't feel formidable.

Just exhausted.

38:43.805 --> 38:46.214
Yes.

38:46.232 --> 38:49.159
Let's go watch

38:49.235 --> 38:51.386
the greatest movie
we ever made.

38:51.404 --> 38:52.704
Yeah.

38:55.983 --> 38:58.409
This is amazing.

38:58.486 --> 38:59.744
That's our baby.

38:59.821 --> 39:02.580
I'm sorry you couldn't be
at the ultrasound.

39:02.749 --> 39:05.383
Nah, it's okay,
this was worth the wait.

39:08.496 --> 39:11.589
I see we still
can't tell the sex.

39:11.666 --> 39:13.925
Guess the kid's shy.

39:14.094 --> 39:15.243
It's so weird.

39:15.261 --> 39:17.445
Dr. Heller said that
she could tell.

39:17.447 --> 39:18.688
Wait.

39:18.765 --> 39:21.191
You didn't look
while you were in the office?

39:23.195 --> 39:26.863
We've been apart for so many
firsts in this pregnancy,

39:27.032 --> 39:29.491
and I wanted to have
this first together.

39:35.448 --> 39:37.040
Hold on.

39:37.117 --> 39:38.583
Could it be?

39:39.786 --> 39:40.877
Oh.

39:41.028 --> 39:42.270
MADDIE: Oh, yeah, yeah.

39:42.288 --> 39:43.588
Yeah, I think--

39:44.958 --> 39:46.257
Oh...

39:49.036 --> 39:51.054
BOTH:
It's a girl.

39:51.131 --> 39:53.056
(door opens)

39:54.542 --> 39:55.892
-Hi, sweetheart.
-MAY: Hi.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.376
Sorry I missed dinner.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.896
Ah. No, you didn't.
Saved you a plate.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.381
Oh, really?
Awesome.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.142
You're pulling overtime
already, huh?

40:04.294 --> 40:06.978
No, I had a counseling session.

40:07.130 --> 40:08.296
Did you have a rough call?

40:08.298 --> 40:09.297
MAY: No, it's just
a precautionary thing.

40:09.466 --> 40:12.800
Because of my age
and my history.

40:12.802 --> 40:14.485
Sue said that it would be good

40:14.638 --> 40:16.638
that I meet with a counselor
every other month.

40:16.640 --> 40:21.643
I didn't know you told them
about the suicide attempt.

40:21.645 --> 40:23.235
MAY: I didn't see the point
in lying to them.

40:23.404 --> 40:25.997
It's on their records.
You did call 9-1-1.

40:26.149 --> 40:28.316
Yes. I did.

40:28.318 --> 40:31.486
So I told them, and Sue said
it wasn't disqualifying,

40:31.504 --> 40:32.654
but she just wanted
to make sure

40:32.822 --> 40:34.580
I had someone to talk to.

40:34.674 --> 40:35.657
Well, that's smart.

40:35.917 --> 40:36.582
I'm glad she's looking out
for you.

40:36.768 --> 40:37.825
MAY:
Yeah, me too.

40:37.827 --> 40:39.210
It's just,
I spent the whole day

40:39.271 --> 40:40.511
talking to people.

40:40.664 --> 40:41.921
Last thing I wanted to do
at the end of it

40:41.998 --> 40:43.181
was talk some more.

40:43.333 --> 40:44.441
Yeah, but that won't go on
forever

40:44.592 --> 40:46.592
once they see you know
how to handle yourself.

40:46.670 --> 40:48.169
BOBBY:
But there's nothing wrong

40:48.171 --> 40:49.261
with seeing somebody forever.

40:49.339 --> 40:50.596
In this line of work, you--

40:50.674 --> 40:52.097
you have to have somebody
to talk to.

40:52.266 --> 40:54.784
I've got my meetings,
your mother's got Dr. Sanford.

40:54.936 --> 40:56.769
Oh, had Dr. Sanford.

40:56.938 --> 40:58.270
I mean, Kara was great.

40:58.348 --> 41:01.124
I would absolutely
see her again if I needed to.

41:01.275 --> 41:02.942
You stopped seeing her.
When?

41:02.961 --> 41:06.296
Um...few weeks ago.

41:07.966 --> 41:08.948
You didn't say anything.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.967
Um, I'm sorry.

41:11.118 --> 41:13.194
It just didn't occur to me.

41:13.196 --> 41:15.363
My sessions with Kara
were to prepare me

41:15.365 --> 41:17.381
for going back out
on the street, and now I am.

41:17.476 --> 41:19.383
No, these sessions
were for more than that.

41:19.478 --> 41:20.868
After everything
that you went through--

41:20.887 --> 41:22.145
ATHENA: Your heart is
in the right place,

41:22.296 --> 41:23.538
but I don't need anyone
to baby me.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.315
Never have and never will.

41:27.652 --> 41:29.043
So if I'm your daughter,
shouldn't that mean

41:29.045 --> 41:30.394
you don't have to baby me?

41:30.489 --> 41:31.713
ATHENA:
Well, you're only half mine.

41:31.731 --> 41:33.381
Your daddy's side still need
looking after.

41:33.399 --> 41:35.049
Then maybe 50% less.

41:35.068 --> 41:36.326
This is not
"Let's Make a Deal."

41:36.519 --> 41:38.828
You're gonna be
my baby forever.

41:40.740 --> 41:42.707
Baby girl Han.

41:44.244 --> 41:45.893
I guess we're gonna
have to get serious

41:45.912 --> 41:48.487
about finding a name now.

41:48.565 --> 41:50.081
Should we do
something traditional

41:50.233 --> 41:52.066
or more modern, like

41:52.085 --> 41:54.235
"Chicago."

41:54.254 --> 41:56.662
You were right.

41:56.740 --> 41:58.497
We are gonna be a family,
the three of us,

41:58.575 --> 42:00.850
and I don't wanna
keep hiding this from you.

42:01.077 --> 42:02.577
Look, I told you,

42:02.595 --> 42:04.912
you don't have to protect me.

42:04.931 --> 42:07.857
You're not the one
I'm trying to protect.
