00:05.689 --> 00:08.487
No, man. Whatever.

00:09.025 --> 00:11.653
You're wrong. Admit you're wrong.

00:11.828 --> 00:12.988
No, she didn't.

00:14.664 --> 00:16.291
What?

00:17.267 --> 00:21.601
Well, then she's a bigger idiot
than you are, which is impossible.

00:21.771 --> 00:25.639
It is impossible.
I'm really good at math, it's impossible.

00:26.843 --> 00:29.175
All right. Cool. Late.

01:04.647 --> 01:07.582
We'll be back around 10.
Make sure to take Bucky out.

01:07.751 --> 01:09.446
You hear me?

01:11.521 --> 01:13.318
I love you.

02:48.051 --> 02:49.780
- That scared me.
- Me too.

02:49.953 --> 02:51.511
- Your turn.
- Okay.

02:51.688 --> 02:54.316
Bo-bell, when you said
you brushed your teeth...

02:54.490 --> 02:56.685
...did you also dry your toothbrush?

02:56.860 --> 02:58.953
- I brushed.
- Ella.

03:05.668 --> 03:07.761
I just love being lied to.

03:08.338 --> 03:11.136
You're a tough mother.
Ella's a sweetheart.

03:11.307 --> 03:15.004
She is a sweetheart.
She's a lying little sweetheart.

03:15.178 --> 03:16.702
She reminds me of you.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.681
I'm going to make sure
she's brushing her teeth.

03:21.684 --> 03:26.053
With all due respect,
Darwin got it all wrong.

03:26.222 --> 03:32.718
I used to make a joke that Darwin's
thinking was rather unevolved.

03:32.896 --> 03:35.126
Which I'm sure used to be very funny.

03:35.798 --> 03:39.700
For a brilliant man,
Darwin was occasionally a moron.

03:39.869 --> 03:44.329
He claimed that males tried to spread
their genes by having sex constantly...

03:44.507 --> 03:48.238
...however, the females
with limited eggs were more selective...

03:48.411 --> 03:51.812
...in their attempts to find
genetically superior males.

03:51.981 --> 03:55.178
I believe that Darwin
was simply inaccurate...

03:55.351 --> 03:57.717
...that females can be
as aggressive as males...

03:57.887 --> 04:01.186
...with males equally dispassionate.

04:02.191 --> 04:04.182
Thoughts, Peter?

04:05.628 --> 04:06.720
This is Astrid.

04:06.896 --> 04:10.195
It's me. Can you have the guys
go outside? I'm sending over a body.

04:10.366 --> 04:12.857
- Yeah, I'll have them waiting outside.
- Thank you.

04:13.036 --> 04:16.334
Okay. Hey, that was Olivia.
She needs you guys outside.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.098
Coroner's on his way with a body.

04:18.274 --> 04:21.709
You know, this is the part of the day
that I look forward to most.

04:21.878 --> 04:26.577
When I know there's something bizarre
out there, I just don't know what it is.

04:26.749 --> 04:30.742
It's like a grab bag of disturbing events,
don't you think?

04:31.354 --> 04:32.685
Yeah.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.790
Be right back, Agent Farnsworth.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.391
Okay. Bye.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.035
Thank you for taking the time.
We know you're grieving.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.677
We're very sorry about your loss.

04:56.079 --> 04:58.070
What the hell
could've done that to him?

04:58.247 --> 05:01.307
We don't know yet.
We're gonna find that out.

05:01.551 --> 05:05.544
Did you notice anything strange in your
son's behavior over the last few days?

05:06.189 --> 05:07.281
No.

05:07.457 --> 05:11.587
School was good,
he was looking forward to graduating.

05:11.761 --> 05:14.491
We had dinner together
almost every night...

05:14.731 --> 05:18.724
...try to get a few syllables out
about his day.

05:18.935 --> 05:21.802
- Any history of drug use?
- No.

05:21.971 --> 05:25.168
I know all parents think that,
but in Greg's case it's true.

05:25.341 --> 05:28.435
Whatever happened,
he didn't bring it on himself.

05:28.611 --> 05:31.842
What about any preexisting
medical conditions?

05:32.015 --> 05:35.610
Asthma. I blame it for all the time
he spends on a computer.

05:35.818 --> 05:37.649
Was he on the computer last night?

05:37.820 --> 05:40.084
Most nights he spends
his free time there...

05:40.256 --> 05:42.918
...playing games, trading songs.

05:43.326 --> 05:47.228
He chats about girls with his friends.

05:48.364 --> 05:49.592
Which friends?

05:50.099 --> 05:53.000
Uh, Luke, probably. Luke Dempsey.

05:53.169 --> 05:56.138
- E-Y?
- Yeah.

05:56.806 --> 05:58.637
We're going to do everything we can...

05:58.808 --> 06:01.038
...to find out what happened
to your son.

06:10.653 --> 06:13.144
He can be rotated onto his back now.

06:13.322 --> 06:15.813
Drain the remainder of his brain.
Once that's done...

06:15.992 --> 06:17.823
...we can examine his cranial cavity.

06:17.994 --> 06:20.053
Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

06:20.263 --> 06:23.699
Just get me everything you can
and call me right back. Thanks.

06:23.866 --> 06:24.890
Everything okay?

06:25.068 --> 06:27.969
Yeah. His parents say
he was a good kid. What do we know?

06:28.137 --> 06:32.233
All I know for sure is that his brain matter
has been completely liquefied.

06:32.408 --> 06:33.705
How?

06:33.876 --> 06:37.972
My first thought is
an extremely virulent form of syphilis.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.672
Your saying his brain
could've been cooked by an STD?

06:40.850 --> 06:43.045
Safe sex is important.

06:43.286 --> 06:46.881
You do always have your
sexual partners wear a condom, I hope.

06:47.056 --> 06:48.216
Walter.

06:48.391 --> 06:51.690
If he got this from a girl or
some drug he was experimenting with...

06:51.861 --> 06:54.193
...there may be a record of that
on his computer.

06:54.363 --> 06:56.160
Astrid, can you check his hard drive?

06:56.332 --> 06:58.493
I had it transferred
with some of his effects.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.568
I got it right here. I'm on it.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.196
Be sure to check
his floppy disks as well.

07:04.707 --> 07:05.935
Floppy disks are outdated.

07:06.109 --> 07:08.270
Why don't you focus on
what you do best?

07:08.444 --> 07:11.413
- All yours. Liquid brains.
- Oh, fantastic.

07:11.581 --> 07:13.674
I'll get the bone saw.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.375
- Hey, check this out.
- What?

07:16.552 --> 07:17.712
Something's wrong.

07:18.254 --> 07:21.087
- The hard drive platters must be fused.
- You sure?

07:21.257 --> 07:23.384
Linguistics major,
computer science minor...

07:23.559 --> 07:26.619
...plus I've been taking computers
apart since I was, like, 6.

07:26.829 --> 07:29.059
So do you think you can get
anything off this?

07:29.232 --> 07:32.633
I know some aggressive data-retrieval
techniques. I can give it a shot.

07:32.835 --> 07:35.895
I'm gonna interview Dempsey
and see if I can dig up something.

07:36.072 --> 07:38.233
Call me
as soon as you find something.

07:43.112 --> 07:47.242
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Luke Dempsey.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.143
Thank you.

07:52.955 --> 07:54.980
Yes, keep it.

07:56.492 --> 07:57.550
Luke Dempsey?

08:00.062 --> 08:02.895
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.225
Can I have a word?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.999
I was just IM'ing with Greg last night.

08:09.605 --> 08:11.232
What happened to him?

08:12.108 --> 08:15.669
To be honest, we're not entirely sure.

08:16.445 --> 08:17.969
What did you two talk about?

08:19.615 --> 08:21.480
A bunch of stuff.

08:22.785 --> 08:26.186
I got him a deal
on a split rear-exhaust for his '93 GT.

08:26.389 --> 08:28.118
Told him he could swing by whenever.

08:28.491 --> 08:33.258
After a couple hours, he just...

08:33.429 --> 08:35.693
He stopped answering.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.899
I figured he'd fell asleep.

08:40.001 --> 08:42.163
How did the two of you
know each other?

08:42.337 --> 08:45.136
Our dads worked together
when we were kids...

08:46.342 --> 08:48.003
...and Greg and I stayed friends.

08:48.544 --> 08:52.605
Can you think of anyone
who may have wanted to hurt Greg?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.443
Or maybe had a grudge against him?

08:57.119 --> 08:59.053
You think somebody killed him?

08:59.555 --> 09:00.647
Do you?

09:07.863 --> 09:09.353
- Dunham.
- Peter.

09:09.532 --> 09:11.727
Just got a call about another body.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.078
- Sir.
- Dunham.

09:24.247 --> 09:27.375
General manager of this dealership
was found dead by an employee.

09:27.550 --> 09:29.313
- We have the employee?
- Yeah.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.921
- He's having a hard time being coherent.
- Well, what exactly happened?

09:33.089 --> 09:35.216
Bishop. Doctor.

09:44.367 --> 09:47.461
Appears he died the same way
as the teenager in Springfield.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.869
Prepare six vials, please.

09:50.539 --> 09:51.767
Yes, sir.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.968
Where's the guy who found him?

09:54.176 --> 09:55.609
This way.

09:55.778 --> 09:59.714
Anton's a nice man. Honest guy.

09:59.882 --> 10:01.213
He has three kids.

10:01.384 --> 10:03.079
When was the last time you saw him?

10:03.252 --> 10:07.245
Last night.
It was a bar we go to sometimes.

10:07.423 --> 10:08.913
Strip club.

10:09.091 --> 10:12.219
My wife doesn't know.
Just please don't judge me.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.886
I'm not judging you.

10:23.639 --> 10:25.436
What?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.374
He's dead, he can't feel this.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.372
I wonder if they sell cars here
with those seats that warm your ass.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.082
Well, why don't you ask him?

10:38.287 --> 10:40.278
Maybe I will.

10:42.091 --> 10:45.254
A little longer than that.
He's been here for three years.

10:45.428 --> 10:47.658
And is there anyone
that would wanna hurt him?

10:47.830 --> 10:50.526
Anton? No. No way. He's solid.

10:50.833 --> 10:53.666
Can I take your card in case
I need to ask more questions?

10:53.836 --> 10:54.996
Yeah, sure.

10:55.171 --> 10:56.297
My cell's on there.

10:56.472 --> 11:01.671
And if you're interested in a new vehicle,
we have next year's models in, so, um...

11:02.845 --> 11:04.472
Now you are judging me.

11:07.283 --> 11:09.774
It's the weirdest thing.

11:09.985 --> 11:13.614
The fused platters we found
on the car salesman's computer...

11:13.789 --> 11:15.757
...they're fried just like the kid's.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.416
Well, that can't be a coincidence.

11:18.594 --> 11:21.427
I'm trying to recover
as much data as possible.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.531
These platters are incredibly sensitive.

11:23.699 --> 11:26.600
A speck of dust is enough
to make them unusable, but this?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.361
Looks like someone took a blowtorch.

11:28.571 --> 11:30.095
From what I was able to pull...

11:30.272 --> 11:34.368
...it looks like both downloaded
a huge file, 657 megabytes each...

11:34.577 --> 11:35.976
...right before they crashed.

11:36.145 --> 11:37.476
Where'd the file come from?

11:37.646 --> 11:40.046
It was a miracle
I was able to salvage this much.

11:40.216 --> 11:43.515
I'd need another couple days
to access the ISP servers.

11:43.686 --> 11:45.654
And that's time that we don't have.

11:49.592 --> 11:51.685
- Is it you?
- Mm-mm.

11:52.228 --> 11:54.458
I haven't heard that sound for ages.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.655
I think it's the phone.

11:59.402 --> 12:00.801
Who would have that number?

12:00.970 --> 12:04.337
It must be on Harvard's system.
I didn't even know it worked.

12:05.508 --> 12:07.203
Hello?

12:09.478 --> 12:11.241
There's nobody here by that name.

12:11.847 --> 12:13.007
Yes, I'm sure.

12:13.416 --> 12:15.976
I think you got the wrong number.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.517
Who was it?

12:17.686 --> 12:20.655
Some student looking for financial aid.

12:22.224 --> 12:24.749
- What are you doing?
- I think...

12:24.927 --> 12:27.191
...I got a guy who could help us.

12:27.363 --> 12:29.263
Who?

12:29.432 --> 12:31.423
You really wanna know?

12:31.767 --> 12:32.859
Good point.

12:33.035 --> 12:36.061
Be careful with that though
because it's evidence.

12:38.574 --> 12:40.235
- Just kidding.
- I'm gonna go talk...

12:40.409 --> 12:42.570
...to Greg Wiles' friend Luke Dempsey.

12:42.745 --> 12:44.713
Agent Dunham?

12:45.047 --> 12:48.710
I think I might know
who was just on the phone.

13:19.782 --> 13:21.841
How's it going, Akim?

13:24.420 --> 13:26.285
Peter Bishop.

13:26.822 --> 13:28.915
Long time.

13:29.925 --> 13:31.654
Not long enough.

13:32.027 --> 13:34.928
Play nice. I come bearing gifts.

13:42.204 --> 13:45.367
My God. I can't believe you kept it.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.338
You could've sold this for a fortune.

13:48.077 --> 13:52.639
I kept it to remind me never to wager
anything I couldn't bear to live without.

13:52.982 --> 13:54.142
I can have it back?

13:54.817 --> 13:56.375
Sure.

13:57.152 --> 13:59.643
First, I'm gonna need some help.

14:12.968 --> 14:14.765
What do you got?

14:15.170 --> 14:17.161
Just before they fried...

14:17.339 --> 14:20.740
...both of these drives
downloaded the same program.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.707
Very good.

14:27.016 --> 14:28.745
And what are we looking for?

14:28.918 --> 14:32.615
I wanna know what it is
and where it came from.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.297
Agent Dunham, I hear Agent Broyles
has you investigating...

14:48.504 --> 14:50.369
...the Bridgeport automotive death.

14:50.539 --> 14:52.769
May I ask what exactly
you're looking for?

14:52.942 --> 14:56.537
I'll be cross-referencing medical
records with the AMA database...

14:56.712 --> 14:59.044
...looking for anything
that might connect him...

14:59.214 --> 15:01.774
...to the teenager
and explain what happened here.

15:01.951 --> 15:05.648
Medical records, AMA database,
liquefied brains? Come on, Dunham.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.949
This case clearly falls under
the jurisdiction of the CDC.

15:09.124 --> 15:12.116
There was no known pathogen,
no signs of contagion.

15:12.294 --> 15:15.821
With all due respect, Agent Harris,
I have done my due diligence.

15:16.031 --> 15:18.761
I just got off the phone
with my contact at the CDC...

15:18.934 --> 15:20.765
...and they have seen nothing like it.

15:20.936 --> 15:23.336
You tell me.
This look like a flu you've heard of?

15:23.539 --> 15:25.734
Where people's brains
come out of their ears?

15:27.676 --> 15:29.405
No.

15:32.581 --> 15:34.105
No.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.676
This looks like you had another excuse
to justify the allocation...

15:38.854 --> 15:42.187
...of FBI resources
to what's arguably become...

15:42.358 --> 15:45.259
...a rogue division
inside a federal agency...

15:45.427 --> 15:47.918
...operating,
if not completely autonomously...

15:48.097 --> 15:51.430
...then well outside
the standard regulatory purview.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.465
I have news for you, Agent Dunham.

15:55.337 --> 15:56.770
I'm here to remedy that.

15:58.674 --> 16:00.505
I'll consider myself warned.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.506
Twelve hours.

16:02.678 --> 16:05.169
After that, I shut you down
and put the case...

16:05.347 --> 16:08.475
...in what I believe will be
considerably more capable hands.

16:17.292 --> 16:19.157
Whoa. What's this?

16:19.662 --> 16:22.130
It's particles scattered
all over the Internet.

16:22.297 --> 16:24.731
This thing must've been
insanely complex.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.631
Integrated video, audio.
Some of this isn't even computer code.

16:28.804 --> 16:29.828
Is that even possible?

16:30.005 --> 16:34.135
Multiple parallel packet routing,
10 times the usual nodes.

16:34.309 --> 16:37.244
Whoever sent this is trying very hard
to cover their tracks.

16:53.328 --> 16:56.195
Akim, come on, you have no idea
where this thing came from?

16:56.365 --> 16:59.163
Nothing yet. There's too many paths.

16:59.368 --> 17:01.063
Wait a sec.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.239
Okay, I can't tell you
where it's originating...

17:08.410 --> 17:10.241
...but I got a destination.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.573
This program's
being downloaded right now.

17:12.748 --> 17:14.271
Then that's the next target.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.010
Neighborhood in Brighton,
here in Boston.

17:17.185 --> 17:18.675
- It's close by.
- Brighton.

17:18.854 --> 17:21.652
- Can you pull up the address?
- Honing in.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.859
There. That's where it's going.

17:27.930 --> 17:29.397
Oh, my God.

17:33.869 --> 17:35.302
- Dunham.
- Olivia, listen to me.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.803
The victims downloaded
the same transmission.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.100
- It's happening again right now.
- Where?

17:40.275 --> 17:42.175
Your apartment.

18:48.577 --> 18:52.104
Hi. I just turned right onto Broadway.
I should be there in five minutes.

18:52.281 --> 18:55.079
- Rachel's not picking up.
- Call the next-door neighbor.

18:55.250 --> 18:58.413
I don't know any of the neighbors.
I haven't seen them for months.

18:58.587 --> 19:00.987
- Well, then call Boston P.D.
- I already have.

19:08.597 --> 19:10.121
Mom.

19:10.499 --> 19:12.660
One minute, Ella.

20:01.550 --> 20:04.986
- Liv, what the hell are you doing?
- Okay, is there someone else here?

20:05.153 --> 20:08.054
- Someone else?
- Of course not, it's just us.

20:08.924 --> 20:11.722
Ella? Ella, everything's gonna be okay.

20:11.894 --> 20:12.986
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:13.161 --> 20:14.753
- Can you check out the back?
- Yeah.

20:14.930 --> 20:17.091
Okay. Ella.

20:17.733 --> 20:20.725
Ella. Ella.

20:20.936 --> 20:23.598
- What's wrong?
- Nothing is wrong, Olivia.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.603
- She's just playing her game, right, Ell?
- Ella.

20:27.442 --> 20:28.739
Ella.

20:28.911 --> 20:31.106
Ella, sweetie.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.508
- Ella?
- Aunt Liv?

20:36.818 --> 20:39.616
When did you get home?

20:42.758 --> 20:44.225
I don't understand.

20:44.826 --> 20:47.420
- What happened?
- There were flashes...

20:47.596 --> 20:49.860
...on the computer screen
when I first came in.

20:50.032 --> 20:51.761
Like bursts of images.

20:51.934 --> 20:54.767
Can't explain it.
It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

20:54.937 --> 20:56.700
- Images.
- Yeah.

20:57.105 --> 21:01.235
And they affected Ella in some way,
like she was hypnotized.

21:03.412 --> 21:06.245
I'm gonna call Computer Forensics.

21:06.415 --> 21:08.576
They'll be here right away.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.751
Trot, trot to Boston

21:11.920 --> 21:13.547
Trot, trot to Lynn

21:13.722 --> 21:16.657
Better watch out
Or you might fall in!

21:17.259 --> 21:20.285
- Do you do birthday parties too?
- Not so much, no.

21:20.495 --> 21:22.986
I have done my fair share
of babysitting lately.

21:23.231 --> 21:26.758
Yeah, well, the way you are with Ella,
it seems like you'd be really good.

21:26.935 --> 21:28.129
At a party.

21:29.972 --> 21:31.837
I'm not really familiar with the word.

21:32.007 --> 21:34.635
Talk to your sister.
She could give me the weekend off.

21:34.876 --> 21:38.073
My sister's not really
the weekend-off type.

21:38.246 --> 21:40.874
That was always more me.

21:42.684 --> 21:46.017
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Ella, come here.

21:47.189 --> 21:48.315
What are you doing?

21:48.490 --> 21:50.481
Get her checked out
as soon as possible.

21:50.692 --> 21:53.183
What are you talking about?
She's fine. Look at her.

21:53.428 --> 21:56.795
- I'm sure everything's fine.
- Liv, what is going on?

21:57.699 --> 22:00.964
There was a hand. I remember.

22:01.470 --> 22:03.995
There was a hand coming out
of the computer.

22:04.172 --> 22:07.107
Okay, we're definitely cutting back
on the sugar intake.

22:07.275 --> 22:09.266
And possibly our visits
with Aunt Olivia.

22:09.444 --> 22:11.412
- Come on, sweetie.
- Hold on a second.

22:11.613 --> 22:13.843
What kind of hand, Ella?

22:14.282 --> 22:20.687
Weird, glowy, scary.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.686
Ella, this isn't funny. Look at me.

22:23.859 --> 22:25.554
You know how I feel about lying.

22:25.727 --> 22:27.854
I'm not!

22:29.331 --> 22:30.696
It really happened.

22:31.466 --> 22:32.490
How?

22:33.568 --> 22:34.899
I don't know.

22:35.070 --> 22:37.834
I was playing with my game,
and I saw this hand.

22:38.006 --> 22:39.496
Which game was it?

22:39.674 --> 22:42.006
My Pony.

22:42.210 --> 22:44.576
I don't want you to go
on that site anymore, okay?

22:45.247 --> 22:47.579
- Promise?
- That's right, sweetheart.

22:51.086 --> 22:53.816
I'm the one you're looking for.

22:59.194 --> 23:00.957
Who's there?

23:01.163 --> 23:04.257
- It's just me, Dad.
- Hey, Luke.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.061
Somebody in here?

23:06.268 --> 23:09.760
- I heard voices.
- Talking to myself.

23:10.539 --> 23:12.006
What are you doing here?

23:12.174 --> 23:14.540
Thought I'd bring you some lunch.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.710
Thanks.

23:23.518 --> 23:25.418
How are things at the body shop,
Luke?

23:25.854 --> 23:27.685
Fine.

23:28.557 --> 23:31.617
Have you found a job yet, Dad?

23:32.594 --> 23:34.357
Who says I'm looking for one?

23:37.699 --> 23:39.997
I went by your place.

23:40.635 --> 23:43.627
Mail's all piled up. Ms. Greeley said
you haven't been home...

23:43.805 --> 23:46.433
...in over a week.
- She should mind her own business.

23:53.448 --> 23:56.144
Have you been sleeping here, Dad?

23:57.252 --> 23:59.049
Luke...

23:59.721 --> 24:02.451
...thanks for the food...

24:02.624 --> 24:04.615
...but I should be getting back to this.

24:06.328 --> 24:08.091
What is it that you're working on?

24:10.132 --> 24:12.100
A new program.

24:12.267 --> 24:13.734
I don't wanna jinx it.

24:17.272 --> 24:20.298
I think it's gonna impress
a lot of people.

24:31.586 --> 24:33.247
Okay, love you.

24:33.455 --> 24:35.150
Bye.

24:35.323 --> 24:36.654
How's Ella doing?

24:36.825 --> 24:40.659
The doctor says she's perfectly healthy.
There's no sign of neurological damage.

24:40.829 --> 24:42.456
- Nothing.
- Excellent news.

24:42.631 --> 24:45.759
Charlie's taking them back.
Gonna keep an eye on the apartment...

24:45.934 --> 24:47.299
...until I get there.
- Good.

24:47.502 --> 24:49.766
- If something had happened to her...
- It didn't.

24:49.971 --> 24:52.667
Don't torture yourself
with hypotheticals. She's fine.

24:52.841 --> 24:54.638
Yeah.

24:56.645 --> 24:59.170
This is gonna sound crazy.

25:00.715 --> 25:03.445
But I think whoever's responsible
was watching.

25:03.652 --> 25:05.711
- Through the computer.
- What?

25:05.887 --> 25:09.015
Light next to the camera was on.
Ella doesn't know how to use it.

25:09.224 --> 25:11.283
- Think he was spying on her?
- I don't know.

25:11.459 --> 25:14.622
Maybe he was trying to scare me.
He knows about the investigation.

25:14.796 --> 25:16.787
This is his way of telling me
to back off.

25:16.965 --> 25:18.728
He could have broken into our network...

25:18.900 --> 25:20.800
...learned you were
investigating his case.

25:20.969 --> 25:22.368
Means maybe we can track him.

25:22.537 --> 25:24.368
We have Forensics on it as we speak.

25:24.539 --> 25:27.633
Also I've got a subcontractor
that I've worked with before.

25:27.809 --> 25:30.141
Trying to track the origin
of the data stream...

25:30.312 --> 25:32.837
...sent to Olivia's computer.
- And this data stream.

25:33.014 --> 25:35.312
It may be connected
to what killed those people?

25:35.483 --> 25:38.543
The victim, Greg Wiles,
was found in front of his computer too.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.383
And his hard drive was fused,
just like the car salesman.

25:42.557 --> 25:45.924
- Computer programming that can kill...
- Can kill people. Yeah, I know.

25:46.127 --> 25:48.925
Walter's working on it at the lab.
What I don't understand:

25:49.164 --> 25:51.325
If a person is responsible
for those deaths...

25:52.000 --> 25:53.490
...why are they killing?

25:53.668 --> 25:55.863
You found any connection
between the victims?

25:56.071 --> 25:57.766
Not yet.

26:00.575 --> 26:02.668
Mark?

26:04.946 --> 26:06.573
Honey?

26:08.516 --> 26:11.246
Can you help me with the groceries?

26:16.391 --> 26:19.087
John and Alice are coming over
for dinner. You remember?

26:19.294 --> 26:21.421
Thought I'd make a roast.

26:21.596 --> 26:26.431
Hey, Dow Jones,
are you alive in there?

26:27.235 --> 26:28.668
Mark?

26:31.706 --> 26:33.469
Mark.

26:38.113 --> 26:39.876
It's amazing, isn't it?

26:40.048 --> 26:42.881
All these people,
and they don't have a clue.

26:43.051 --> 26:45.542
How crazy it all really is.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.950
The world, everything.

26:48.123 --> 26:49.784
If we do our job, they'll never have to.

26:51.726 --> 26:54.058
- Olivia Dunham.
- We got another death.

26:54.229 --> 26:58.290
This one, outside Chicago.
This one's a day trader.

26:58.466 --> 27:00.559
It's happened again.

27:00.735 --> 27:02.896
When are you gonna start
calling them murders?

27:03.071 --> 27:05.835
When you find us a murderer.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.699
Send me everything you can
on the victim.

27:08.910 --> 27:11.504
- Will do.
- Okay.

27:13.648 --> 27:15.843
I'll meet you inside, okay?

27:29.130 --> 27:30.859
Are you Jessica Warren?

27:31.933 --> 27:33.127
Yes.

27:33.968 --> 27:36.732
- I'm Peter Bishop...
- I know.

27:39.341 --> 27:41.536
I read your letter.

27:42.344 --> 27:47.111
And I can understand, of course,
why you would want to see my father.

27:47.282 --> 27:48.943
But it's not the right time.

27:49.150 --> 27:52.779
He's only been out of the institution
for a couple months. After 17 years...

27:52.954 --> 27:54.182
And three months.

27:54.356 --> 27:57.154
Mr. Bishop,
I know exactly how long it's been.

27:59.060 --> 28:00.254
I'm sure you do.

28:02.397 --> 28:05.389
I'm very sorry for what happened,
Mrs. Warren.

28:05.567 --> 28:07.728
I wish this weren't the case.

28:07.902 --> 28:10.666
But nothing will
bring your daughter back.

28:10.839 --> 28:12.397
Not even talking to my father.

28:13.007 --> 28:14.565
I need to see him.

28:15.343 --> 28:16.742
To do what?

28:16.911 --> 28:18.970
To blame him for the accident?

28:19.147 --> 28:21.377
It's between me and your father.

28:25.553 --> 28:27.851
I'm sorry, it's not going to happen.

28:37.031 --> 28:39.226
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:40.068 --> 28:41.194
I'm glad Ella's okay.

28:41.836 --> 28:44.737
Oh, thank you.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.343
Oh, Agent Dunham.

28:49.511 --> 28:52.036
I think I worked out
how these deaths occurred.

28:52.247 --> 28:58.083
It's a complex combination of visual
and subsonic aural stimuli...

28:58.253 --> 29:02.849
...ingeniously designed to amplify
the electrical impulses of the brain...

29:03.057 --> 29:05.218
...trapping it in an endless loop.
- Walter?

29:05.427 --> 29:09.261
It's like a computer virus
that infects people.

29:10.131 --> 29:13.589
I don't understand. Ella said she saw
a hand coming out of the computer.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.463
Hallucinatory effect of the stimuli,
perhaps.

29:17.372 --> 29:20.136
I need to research further.

29:23.044 --> 29:24.068
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:24.245 --> 29:25.473
Where's the latest victim?

29:25.713 --> 29:27.772
Uh, just outside of Chicago.

29:27.982 --> 29:29.142
Any motive yet?

29:29.751 --> 29:31.116
Not yet.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.081
Listen.

29:33.755 --> 29:36.747
I think I know who that woman was,
outside.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.092
What do you think you know?

29:41.563 --> 29:43.428
She's the mother
of the lab assistant...

29:43.598 --> 29:46.089
...killed in the fire here almost
20 years ago.

29:48.169 --> 29:50.569
It's none of my business.

29:51.005 --> 29:52.472
Go ahead. What?

29:53.274 --> 29:55.970
Does Walter know?
That she wants to see him?

29:57.078 --> 29:59.569
Of course Walter doesn't know.

29:59.747 --> 30:00.873
He couldn't handle it.

30:01.583 --> 30:02.914
I see.

30:05.987 --> 30:08.319
You think that he could?

30:10.492 --> 30:12.460
I don't know why, but I do.

30:13.161 --> 30:16.187
You really think it's a good idea
to put him through that?

30:17.165 --> 30:21.602
Well, I was thinking that
it's all unresolved. For him, for her.

30:21.769 --> 30:23.930
I was thinking it must be hard
for her too...

30:24.105 --> 30:26.596
...to come to the place
where she lost her daughter.

30:26.774 --> 30:29.106
- What's your point?
- That you underestimate him.

30:29.277 --> 30:32.007
Your father. And you shouldn't.

30:40.321 --> 30:44.018
Here is what Charlie was able
to dig up on the last victim.

30:46.694 --> 30:50.130
Mark Rosenthal, 48, married.

30:50.298 --> 30:52.061
Any information on his next of kin?

30:52.300 --> 30:57.135
It's sad, actually. He just got married
last year to a Miriam Dempsey.

30:57.305 --> 30:58.670
I have her number if you want it.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.831
- Did you say Dempsey?
- Mm-hm.

31:01.009 --> 31:03.170
I interviewed a Luke Dempsey
this morning.

31:03.344 --> 31:05.676
He was friends with the teen victim,
Greg Wiles.

31:06.681 --> 31:10.310
According to this background info,
Miriam Dempsey is Luke's mother.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.546
So that would make the last victim
Luke's stepfather.

31:14.355 --> 31:15.822
- Yeah.
- What are the chances...

31:15.990 --> 31:18.584
...of the same kid being connected
to both victims?

31:18.826 --> 31:21.556
- Maybe Luke is the killer.
- It's possible.

31:21.729 --> 31:25.995
But he seemed genuinely upset
when I told him his friend was dead.

31:27.402 --> 31:30.098
He did mention something else.
He said that the reason...

31:30.271 --> 31:34.037
...he was friends with the victim was
because their fathers worked together.

31:36.077 --> 31:39.274
Is everything all right?
I heard you and Agent Dunham.

31:39.480 --> 31:42.347
From the tone, it sounded like
you were having an argument.

31:42.717 --> 31:44.344
Everything's fine.

31:46.020 --> 31:48.181
I tried to expense a couple
Celtic tickets on the FBI.

31:48.356 --> 31:50.984
- She caught me.
- Oh, I see.

31:51.693 --> 31:57.996
I hope she doesn't notice the $2000
for the baboon seminal fluid I ordered.

31:58.199 --> 32:02.135
I hope I can recall why I ordered it.

32:05.106 --> 32:08.041
- What's up?
- I think we have our suspect.

32:09.644 --> 32:11.942
- Brian Dempsey.
- He used to work for Paul Wiles.

32:12.947 --> 32:14.414
- Greg's dad?
- Exactly.

32:14.616 --> 32:17.483
He was Dempsey's boss
until he fired Dempsey six years ago.

32:17.652 --> 32:21.053
According to Wiles, he was
a programmer, way ahead of his time.

32:21.255 --> 32:23.723
Wiles said when he fired him,
Brian threw a fit.

32:23.891 --> 32:27.554
Yeah, and the victim outside Chicago
was married to Dempsey's ex-wife.

32:27.729 --> 32:30.459
- Really nasty divorce too.
- What about the car salesman?

32:30.665 --> 32:32.633
We're still looking for that connection.

32:32.800 --> 32:36.327
But it looks like Dempsey's m.o. is
to hurt people who screwed him over...

32:36.537 --> 32:39.665
...by going after their loved ones.
- Charlie, yeah, it's me.

32:39.841 --> 32:43.106
I need you to get to
Brian Dempsey's house. Luke's father.

32:43.277 --> 32:44.642
I think he's our guy.

32:56.457 --> 32:57.822
Dunham, where's our suspect?

32:57.992 --> 33:00.859
No sign of him at home.
We picked up his son from work.

33:01.095 --> 33:03.256
- What's your plan?
- Wait for the right moment.

33:05.133 --> 33:07.363
Well, why wait?
Just go in and break him.

33:07.602 --> 33:11.265
- I'm not sure that's the way to go.
- You care to share your reasoning?

33:11.472 --> 33:14.464
I think Luke suspects
there's something wrong with his father.

33:14.642 --> 33:18.009
If we go in heavy-handed,
he could shut down or call a lawyer.

33:18.179 --> 33:20.170
And then he won't tell us anything.

33:20.381 --> 33:22.781
It's your job to make sure
that doesn't happen.

33:23.351 --> 33:25.717
I'm more than familiar with
passive coercion.

33:25.953 --> 33:27.181
Good.

33:27.355 --> 33:29.550
Then find his pressure point.

33:29.724 --> 33:33.558
Put your little hands around him
and squeeze.

33:33.728 --> 33:34.888
That's an order.

33:37.231 --> 33:40.223
Every time that guy opens his mouth,
I like him more and more.

33:40.968 --> 33:43.232
- So.
- Come on.

33:44.672 --> 33:46.139
Luke.

33:46.808 --> 33:49.208
This is Agent Francis.

33:52.213 --> 33:55.410
- Where's your father?
- No idea.

34:01.522 --> 34:04.423
- Tell me about him.
- What do you want to know?

34:04.625 --> 34:07.219
He had a pretty rough ride.

34:07.395 --> 34:10.989
Smart. Maybe a little too smart
for his own good.

34:11.199 --> 34:12.996
Couldn't hold down a job.

34:13.167 --> 34:14.690
Then he gets dumped by your mom.

34:14.902 --> 34:16.733
That couldn't have been easy.

34:16.904 --> 34:19.498
People don't understand him.

34:20.041 --> 34:21.770
They don't take the time.

34:21.943 --> 34:23.534
When did you see him last?

34:24.879 --> 34:27.074
A few weeks ago.

34:28.882 --> 34:30.009
We aren't really close.

34:34.222 --> 34:36.190
Have you spoken
to your mom recently?

34:39.060 --> 34:41.527
Do you know what happened
to your stepfather?

34:46.667 --> 34:50.364
And I told you about Greg myself.

34:50.538 --> 34:53.701
Come on, Luke. The only thing
that these victims have in common...

34:53.875 --> 34:55.900
...besides having their brains
liquefied...

34:56.077 --> 34:59.410
...was that they were all close
to someone who pissed off your father.

34:59.580 --> 35:01.741
This guy died
because he married your mother.

35:01.949 --> 35:05.214
And your friend Greg here,
he died because his dad fired your dad.

35:05.386 --> 35:06.683
That's impossible!

35:06.888 --> 35:09.982
The horror show in this picture
was a friend of yours.

35:10.224 --> 35:12.419
- You wanna cover it up now?
- No!

35:14.495 --> 35:18.454
I want a lawyer. Don't I get a lawyer?

35:21.903 --> 35:24.064
Is it any consolation knowing
you were right?

35:29.510 --> 35:32.479
Do me a favor.
Wait five minutes, then release him.

35:34.515 --> 35:36.142
What about Harris?

35:36.317 --> 35:38.308
Screw him.

35:38.486 --> 35:40.454
My thoughts exactly.

35:41.489 --> 35:44.583
- Okay, come on.
- What did I miss?

35:44.792 --> 35:46.020
Just trust me.

36:07.381 --> 36:09.110
Yeah, hi. I need a cab.

36:12.954 --> 36:14.182
I need to hear that call.

36:18.993 --> 36:20.654
Thank you.

36:21.128 --> 36:22.493
- 2 Braddock Street.

36:22.663 --> 36:25.063
That's one person going
to 1432 Braddock Street.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.064
- I'll have a car there in 10 minutes.
- Ten minutes, right?

36:28.269 --> 36:31.033
Okay. All right, thanks.

36:37.011 --> 36:38.478
He just called a cab.

36:38.679 --> 36:40.704
One guess where it's taking him.

36:41.182 --> 36:43.912
Oh, come on.
He cannot possibly be that stupid.

36:44.151 --> 36:45.413
He's 19.

36:47.889 --> 36:49.356
Good point.

37:01.936 --> 37:04.029
I don't underestimate my father,
by the way.

37:04.205 --> 37:07.538
I understand him,
sometimes more than I want to.

37:07.708 --> 37:10.506
If I let him talk to that woman,
she's gonna accuse him...

37:10.678 --> 37:13.112
...of killing her daughter,
something he didn't do.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.009
Then why not just let them meet?

37:16.350 --> 37:18.079
Whose side are you on, anyway?

37:18.252 --> 37:20.914
I know what it's like
to live with something unresolved.

37:21.088 --> 37:22.521
- That's all.
- Congratulations.

37:22.690 --> 37:25.215
You just described the entire planet.

37:25.426 --> 37:27.917
This could provide closure
for your father.

37:28.129 --> 37:32.190
He's had to live with the death of this
woman. He was put away because of it.

37:32.366 --> 37:34.800
Who's to say this wouldn't
be a resolution for him?

37:34.969 --> 37:38.530
If I didn't know better, I'd think you
wanted the man to have a breakdown.

37:38.739 --> 37:41.799
Maybe you don't know better.
Because I care for your father too.

37:41.976 --> 37:44.809
I believe shielding him from the truth,
from what's real...

37:44.979 --> 37:46.742
...ultimately does him a disservice.

37:47.248 --> 37:50.615
What's real doesn't really seem
to concern Walter.

37:50.785 --> 37:54.277
You said this was none of your business.
That was right on the money.

38:06.067 --> 38:08.729
- Okay, you stay here.
- You are not going in there alone.

38:08.936 --> 38:10.733
Just stay here
and watch the entrance.

38:10.905 --> 38:13.567
- Will you call for backup?
- Harris wants me to screw up.

38:13.741 --> 38:17.802
If I call for help, he's gonna do
whatever it takes to make me look bad.

38:29.090 --> 38:31.422
Where the hell are Dunham
and the kid?

38:31.592 --> 38:33.116
No idea.

38:33.294 --> 38:37.754
Hey! Trace the GPS in Dunham's
car. I wanna know where she is now.

38:38.833 --> 38:41.597
I mean, why the hell
would you do that?

38:47.908 --> 38:53.039
Did you actually do it?
Actually kill Greg from here?

38:53.280 --> 38:56.010
I mean, how many more, Dad?
Who else, huh?

38:56.217 --> 38:58.117
All they had to do was
give me a chance.

38:58.285 --> 39:00.810
A fair shake.
A chance to prove myself.

39:00.988 --> 39:03.980
But they thought they could drop me
to the curb like garbage.

39:08.229 --> 39:09.856
No.

39:13.734 --> 39:16.669
- So all this is supposed to fix that?
- Luke...

39:16.871 --> 39:20.307
I don't know who you are anymore, Dad.
I used to look up to you.

39:21.809 --> 39:23.902
But now you're pathetic.

39:28.215 --> 39:30.046
Go.

39:30.251 --> 39:31.912
They're coming for me, not for you.

39:32.086 --> 39:33.246
- Dad...
- Go!

40:33.814 --> 40:35.111
Stay right where you are.

40:48.129 --> 40:50.495
You've ruined everything.

40:50.698 --> 40:53.223
People were going to respect me.

40:53.467 --> 40:54.866
Respect my work.

40:57.438 --> 40:59.998
Now my son hates me
because of you.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.300
This is how it ends.

41:04.044 --> 41:07.138
- Okay...
- Stay back, or I'll kill you too.

41:20.961 --> 41:23.156
It was their fault, all of it.

41:23.364 --> 41:26.527
I just wanted them to feel the pain
that they made me feel.

41:26.734 --> 41:27.928
Just put the gun down.

41:28.102 --> 41:31.697
Why should you care
whether I live or die?

41:31.872 --> 41:34.102
Especially when you know
what I've done.

41:53.127 --> 41:55.755
Mr. Dempsey,
look away from the screen.

41:55.996 --> 42:01.434
No, I wanna see.
I wanna finally see my creation.

42:08.209 --> 42:09.767
Stop right there!

42:11.312 --> 42:13.576
- Hey, there, Luke.
- Shut up.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.045
- Leave my father alone.
- Luke, take it easy.

42:16.250 --> 42:18.218
Stay back!

42:22.957 --> 42:24.117
Dunham!

42:24.325 --> 42:26.088
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

42:26.293 --> 42:28.557
- Luke, Luke...
- What did you do to him?!

42:28.762 --> 42:31.560
No, I didn't. He went into a trance
and shot himself.

42:37.171 --> 42:38.934
Freeze!

42:39.773 --> 42:41.138
Get on your knees, son.

42:42.076 --> 42:44.135
Get on your knees.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.535
I don't get it.

43:11.705 --> 43:13.673
He knew he was killing those people.

43:14.642 --> 43:17.133
Why would the kid
protect a murderer like that?

43:19.847 --> 43:22.213
Because it's his father.

43:39.133 --> 43:42.000
- Sanford.
- Interesting day.

43:42.169 --> 43:44.194
So I hear.

43:44.405 --> 43:46.236
For the record...

43:46.407 --> 43:50.366
...your agent
disobeyed a direct order of mine...

43:50.611 --> 43:51.908
...released Luke Dempsey...

43:52.112 --> 43:55.570
...and then attempted
to apprehend a suspect without backup.

43:55.749 --> 43:56.977
From what I can tell...

43:57.151 --> 44:00.143
...Agent Dunham closed this case
in spite of your obstructions.

44:00.354 --> 44:03.380
She violated too many aspects
of FBI protocol to even count.

44:03.557 --> 44:05.047
She ID'd a murderer...

44:05.225 --> 44:07.921
...contained a computer program
that melts peoples' brains.

44:08.128 --> 44:10.323
- Listen to me, Phillip.
- No, you listen to me.

44:10.698 --> 44:14.190
What you pass off as bureaucratic
concern looks like a personal vendetta.

44:14.368 --> 44:17.064
And if you push it,
I will stake my career on her behalf.

44:18.205 --> 44:19.729
Are you threatening me, Phillip?

44:19.940 --> 44:22.841
You decide to go after Olivia Dunham,
you're going after me.

44:23.010 --> 44:25.706
And all the red tape in the world
won't protect you.

44:30.351 --> 44:31.841
You sure you're up for this?

44:32.019 --> 44:35.284
Because I got a lot of red tape, Phil.

44:37.925 --> 44:39.756
Walter.

44:42.529 --> 44:44.690
There's a woman here
who wants to talk to you.

44:44.865 --> 44:46.196
She pretty?

44:47.267 --> 44:48.564
She's right there.

44:53.240 --> 44:59.475
Now, look. If you need me,
I'll be right here.

44:59.680 --> 45:03.776
If you need to end the conversation
for any reason, you just say the word.

45:20.834 --> 45:25.897
My daughter's name was
Carla Warren.

45:31.478 --> 45:32.502
Oh, dear.

45:36.750 --> 45:38.980
Do you remember her?

45:44.158 --> 45:46.251
Yes.

45:50.464 --> 45:55.299
I want to see you because you were
the last person to see my daughter alive.

45:55.469 --> 46:02.705
And I've always wanted to ask,
was there anything else I could know?

46:02.876 --> 46:08.246
Anything, anything else
you could tell me about my daughter.

46:10.951 --> 46:15.684
She was a wonderful girl.

46:17.624 --> 46:21.492
What I remember is her smile.

46:22.963 --> 46:24.294
She had a wonderful smile.

46:29.136 --> 46:30.194
I miss Carla.

46:31.972 --> 46:34.270
Me too.

46:42.349 --> 46:44.647
I miss her.

46:47.654 --> 46:52.353
I'll tell you everything
I remember about our time together.

46:55.796 --> 46:59.857
Part of me wants to ask you
to explain what happened with Ella.

47:00.033 --> 47:03.298
But I'm not sure I'll feel any safer
if I know.

47:03.804 --> 47:05.567
You wouldn't.

47:07.307 --> 47:09.207
How do you do it, Liv?

47:13.413 --> 47:15.108
I brushed.

47:15.349 --> 47:18.216
Fantastic. Say good night.

47:18.418 --> 47:21.046
Okay, come here and give me a kiss.

47:21.922 --> 47:23.856
On the cheek.

47:24.024 --> 47:25.389
I tricked you.

47:25.559 --> 47:28.084
Okay, good night, sweetheart.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.889
Night.

47:48.215 --> 47:50.979
- Hi.
- What's up?

47:52.586 --> 47:54.611
First of all,
I've had a couple of drinks.

47:54.788 --> 47:57.256
But don't worry, I walked over.

47:57.457 --> 48:00.949
- Okay.
- And, uh...

48:01.995 --> 48:05.624
...I wanted to say that...

48:07.668 --> 48:11.069
I've never had him in my life. Walter.

48:12.973 --> 48:17.433
And now thanks to your insane
freak show of an operation, I do.

48:18.512 --> 48:21.072
Have him in my life.

48:22.115 --> 48:24.481
And I think that I was...

48:25.686 --> 48:28.382
I think that I was a little scared.

48:29.756 --> 48:32.884
And maybe if he'd talked
to that woman...

48:35.395 --> 48:37.625
Whatever, I...

48:37.798 --> 48:39.959
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

48:40.133 --> 48:42.033
You were right.

48:43.837 --> 48:45.395
Thank you.

48:47.107 --> 48:48.972
You're welcome.

48:51.778 --> 48:53.177
Hi.

48:53.847 --> 48:55.508
Hi.

48:56.450 --> 48:57.542
How's Ella doing?

48:58.318 --> 49:00.218
Good, thanks.

49:02.489 --> 49:05.117
Liv, she wants you to tuck her in.

49:05.626 --> 49:07.287
Okay.

49:13.533 --> 49:17.162
- So I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah.
