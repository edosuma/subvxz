00:03.671 --> 00:04.877
Previously on "Teen Wolf":

00:05.047 --> 00:06.207
What the hell is a Kanima?

00:06.424 --> 00:08.415
- Do they think iâ€™r's Lydia?
- How do we know it's not her?

00:08.593 --> 00:10.458
She was bitten by an Alpha. It's her.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.376
I was thinking
I'd channel it into killing her.

00:12.555 --> 00:15.342
- You cannot do this!
- I can't let her live!

00:15.516 --> 00:17.256
We've got to figure out a way
to protect her.

00:17.435 --> 00:20.927
They're not here to scare us.
They're here to kill Lydia.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.561
I can hold you off
until the cops get here.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.397
I think I'm finally getting
why you keep refusing me, Scott.

00:28.571 --> 00:32.029
You're not an Omega.
You're already an Alpha of your own pack.

00:36.621 --> 00:37.736
It's Jackson.

02:15.595 --> 02:18.337
I need you to promise
that you won't say anything

02:18.556 --> 02:20.137
about what just happened.

02:20.725 --> 02:23.057
|'|| promise not to say anything
about what just happened

02:23.227 --> 02:25.809
if you can tell me
what the hell just happened.

02:26.022 --> 02:28.183
It's... It's kind of complicated.

02:28.399 --> 02:32.142
Well, how about you start with
why was Derek there?

02:32.361 --> 02:35.853
Or where Jackson went,
or what is wrong with Erica?

02:37.575 --> 02:39.440
Oh, do you need a minute
to come up with a plausible lie?

02:39.619 --> 02:41.484
Part of the reason
why I'm asking is because

02:41.662 --> 02:43.994
Scott and | aren't supposed
to be seeing each other, okay?

02:44.206 --> 02:46.618
So it's better if you just keep
what you know to yourself.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.123
Fine.

02:48.336 --> 02:51.828
I'll keep what I know about you
and your boyfriend,

02:52.089 --> 02:54.922
which is nothing, to myself.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.340
Hey.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.551
He's not just my boyfriend.
You get that, right?

02:59.764 --> 03:01.880
- Let me go.
- Just for one second, please,

03:02.058 --> 03:03.594
- try and remember...
- Remember what?

03:03.768 --> 03:06.305
Remember what it feels like.

03:08.230 --> 03:12.348
All of those times in school
when you see him standing down the hall,

03:12.526 --> 03:16.360
and you cannot breathe
until you're with him.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.821
Or those times in class when you...

03:20.034 --> 03:21.945
you can't stop looking at the clock
because you know that

03:22.119 --> 03:24.576
he's standing right out there
waiting for you.

03:24.789 --> 03:27.201
Don't you remember what that's like?

03:29.794 --> 03:30.874
No.

03:31.671 --> 03:34.458
What do you mean, "No"?
You've had boyfriends.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.382
None like that.

04:02.493 --> 04:03.528
What do we do now?

06:45.364 --> 06:47.150
- Wait, wait.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.615
- Did you see where he went?
- I lost him.

06:49.827 --> 06:52.864
- What? You couldn't catch his scent?
- I don't think he has one.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.196
All right, any clue where he's going?

06:55.416 --> 06:56.576
To kill someone.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.000
Ah! That explains the claws
and the fangs and all that.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.748
Good. Makes perfect sense now.

07:02.423 --> 07:03.583
What? Scott, come on.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.544
I'm 147 pounds of pale skin
and fragile bone, okay?

07:06.719 --> 07:08.255
Sarcasm is my only defense.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.670
- Just help me find it.
- Not "if." Jackson.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.426
Yeah, I know. I know.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.636
All right, but does he know that?

07:14.852 --> 07:17.468
Did anybody else see him
back at your house?

07:17.688 --> 07:20.430
I mean, I don't think so,
but he already passed Derek's test anyway.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.894
Yeah, but that's just the thing.
How did he pass the test?

07:23.068 --> 07:24.478
I don't know.

07:24.695 --> 07:27.061
Maybe it's like an either-or thing.

07:27.281 --> 07:32.116
I mean, Derek said that a snake
can't be poisoned by its own venom, right?

07:32.328 --> 07:34.319
When's the Kanima not the Kanima?

07:36.707 --> 07:38.197
When it's Jackson.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.751
Uh...

07:44.715 --> 07:45.795
Dude.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.544
See that?

07:53.349 --> 07:54.555
He's inside.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.015
What's he gonna do in there?

07:59.897 --> 08:01.182
I know who he's after.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.643
What, how? How?
Did you smell something?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.234
Armani.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.621
Aw, come on.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.540
All right, maybe there's, like,
a window we could climb through,

08:22.753 --> 08:24.960
or some kind of

08:25.547 --> 08:28.209
handle that we could rip off
with supernatural strength.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.131
How did I not think of that one?

08:49.196 --> 08:50.936
Dude, everyone in here's a dude.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.569
I think we're in a gay club.

08:55.536 --> 08:59.028
Man, nothing gets past those
keen werewolf senses, huh, Scott?

09:12.928 --> 09:14.668
You're better off without him.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.389
Still doesn't feel good.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.010
You know what will feel good? That guy.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.228
Two beers.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.691
IDs?

09:39.997 --> 09:41.282
How about two Cokes?

09:41.874 --> 09:43.660
Rum and Coke? Sure.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.543
Coke's fine, actually.
I'm driving anyway.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.667
That one's paid for.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.174
Oh, shut up.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.223
- I didn't say anything.
- Yeah, well, your face did.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.446
Hey, I found Danny.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.355
I found Jackson.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.207
Okay.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.748
I love you.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.093
Go. Go.

10:45.187 --> 10:46.643
Let's go, Prada.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.221
You're all of six pounds.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.644
There can't be that much
to come out of you.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.776
Prada, let's go!

11:02.830 --> 11:04.070
Prada?

11:20.556 --> 11:21.762
Prada.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.012
Prada?

11:36.321 --> 11:37.822
Lose something?

11:43.579 --> 11:44.819
Get Danny.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.824
What're you gonna do?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.031
Works for me.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.464
Danny!

12:04.349 --> 12:05.509
Danny!

12:08.520 --> 12:09.805
Danny.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.393
Jackson!

13:02.658 --> 13:03.989
No, don't!

14:02.551 --> 14:04.291
What do we do with him now?

14:09.850 --> 14:13.468
So, should I call the police,
or is there a non-rapist explanation

14:13.687 --> 14:15.302
for being in my yard
in the middle of the night?

14:15.856 --> 14:19.815
I heard him barking,
and I live in the house back there.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.192
Is that okay, or should I start running?

14:24.156 --> 14:26.772
Well, thanks for bringing him back.

14:27.576 --> 14:28.736
Everything okay?

14:30.704 --> 14:32.114
"Okay" meaning what?

14:32.331 --> 14:34.868
Meaning... Are you all right?

14:35.417 --> 14:37.408
Meaning the other day in class?

14:38.712 --> 14:40.077
I'm not crazy.

14:40.255 --> 14:43.338
I may be the girl who sleepwalks naked
and writes backwards on the chalkboard,

14:43.508 --> 14:48.172
but at least I'm not one of those desperate
Vicodin-popping wrist cutters at school.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.929
Oh, is that what the other girls are like?

14:55.145 --> 14:56.601
Why'd you do that?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.179
Do what?

14:58.690 --> 15:00.351
You stepped back.

15:01.485 --> 15:02.691
You stepped forward.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.193
Maybe I wanted to kiss you.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.943
Maybe I don't want you to.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.697
Does that mean maybe I could?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.655
If you want me to punch you in the throat.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.541
Could I hold your hand?

15:21.004 --> 15:22.790
What, am | nine years old?

15:23.173 --> 15:26.711
Uh, could I give you a flower?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.507
Promise to keep it?

15:31.973 --> 15:34.965
If I ask you tomorrow if you have it
and you say, "No,"

15:35.852 --> 15:37.353
I'm gonna be really hurt.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.520
Well, if I don't,

15:42.025 --> 15:43.435
|'|| lie.

15:48.907 --> 15:49.942
Danny.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.535
McCall, what are you doing here?

15:52.744 --> 15:54.951
Just seeing if you're okay.

15:55.205 --> 15:59.118
And I'm wondering if anything weird
happened to you today.

15:59.376 --> 16:02.288
- Besides being paralyzed from the neck down.
- Sorry, but we need to get him to the hospital.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.998
One more question, just one.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.289
Are you okay?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.333
Did it happen to my ex, too?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.596
Yeah.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.007
Then I'm great.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.681
- I couldn't get anything out of Danny.
- Okay, can we just get the hell out of here now

16:23.859 --> 16:26.020
before one of my dad's deputies sees me?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.490
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Could this get any worse?

16:35.078 --> 16:36.739
That was rhetorical.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.575
Get rid of him.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.749
Get rid of him?
We're at a crime scene and he's the sheriff.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.417
Do something.

16:48.592 --> 16:49.707
Hey.

16:50.260 --> 16:53.752
- What's... What's going on?
- Jackson, Jackson, be quiet.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.428
What're you doing here?

16:55.599 --> 16:57.760
What do you mean what am I doing here?
What? It's a club.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.718
It's a club, we were clubbing, you know?
At the club.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.929
Not exactly your type of club.

17:06.818 --> 17:07.773
Uh...

17:08.695 --> 17:11.732
- Well, Dad, there's a conversation that...
- You're not gay.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.239
- I could be.
- Not dressed like that.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.741
Well, what's...

17:18.413 --> 17:19.198
Uh...

17:22.000 --> 17:24.036
Jackson, be quiet.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.999
This is the second crime scene that you
just happened to have shown up on.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.004
And at this point,
I've been fed so many lies,

17:30.175 --> 17:31.540
I'm not sure I know
the kid standing in front of me.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.219
Now, what the hell is going on?

17:33.386 --> 17:34.922
What's happening?

17:35.222 --> 17:37.087
Jackson, I'm sorry, but...

17:39.768 --> 17:40.928
Hey.

17:42.521 --> 17:45.479
- Dad, I...
- The truth, Stiles.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.188
The truth, all right.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.022
Well, the truth is
that we were here with Danny.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.571
Yeah, 'cause he just broke up
with his boyfriend so,

17:59.788 --> 18:03.372
you know, we were just trying to take him out
and get his mind off things. That's it.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.544
Well, that's really good of you guys.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.293
You're good friends.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.893
Seven paralyzed.
The rumor is drugs.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.855
Probably hallucinogens,
since witnesses say they saw

18:36.074 --> 18:38.156
a demonic monster on the dance floor.

18:38.368 --> 18:40.950
Now, who would believe
something like that?

18:41.162 --> 18:43.744
You know what
I'm having trouble believing?

18:43.957 --> 18:47.290
How you just stood there while
that thing circled you and did nothing.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.868
- You want to explain that to me?
- Intuition.

18:50.255 --> 18:53.213
- Then you know what it is.
- I have a suspicion.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.250
And if I'm right, it plays by certain rules.

18:56.511 --> 18:59.002
Rules that don't bend easily.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.139
Do we need to put a hold on Derek
to figure this thing out?

19:03.602 --> 19:04.887
Not necessarily.

19:05.061 --> 19:09.145
Tonight's the first time you had
a glimpse of him since Kate died,

19:09.316 --> 19:11.773
- am I right?
- Unfortunately.

19:13.236 --> 19:18.071
And the only other tie
we have to him is Isaac Lahey.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.232
What are you thinking?

19:20.410 --> 19:24.779
That if this thing bothers Derek
enough to bring him out of his little hole,

19:24.998 --> 19:27.284
then we might have an opportunity.

19:28.001 --> 19:31.744
What did I teach you
is the best way to eliminate a threat?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.376
Get someone to do it for you.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.179
- Uh, what about your house?
- Not with my mom there.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.090
We need to take him somewhere

19:46.269 --> 19:48.555
where we can hold him long enough
to figure out what to do with him.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.138
Or long enough to convince him
he's dangerous.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.183
- I still say we just kill him.
- We're not killing him.

19:54.402 --> 19:55.653
God!

19:55.862 --> 19:57.068
Okay, okay.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.522
I got an idea.

20:00.742 --> 20:04.075
- Does it involve breaking the law?
- By now, don't you think that's a given?

20:04.287 --> 20:07.370
- l was just trying to be optimistic.
- Don't bother.

20:23.765 --> 20:24.845
Stiles!

20:25.975 --> 20:27.385
McCall!

20:27.769 --> 20:29.760
I'm gonna kill you!

20:50.709 --> 20:53.667
- Okay, I bought you some food...
- Let me out now!

20:54.421 --> 20:56.537
You know, I put those pants on you,
all right, buddy?

20:56.715 --> 20:58.125
One leg at a time.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.339
Being all up-close and personal
with your junk

21:00.552 --> 21:02.042
wasn't exactly a highlight of my day.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.633
So don't think this is fun for me either.
You know we're actually doing you a favor?

21:05.849 --> 21:07.965
- This is doing me a favor?
- Yes.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.799
You're killing people.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.975
To death. Yeah.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.770
And until we can figure out how to
stop you, you're gonna stay in here.

21:14.983 --> 21:15.938
I'm sorry.

21:16.151 --> 21:20.110
Now, do you want the ham and cheese
or the turkey club?

21:20.864 --> 21:23.401
You actually think my parents
won't be looking for me?

21:24.159 --> 21:26.946
Well, not if they don't think
anything's wrong.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.030
Yeah.

21:35.086 --> 21:38.249
Mr. Whittemore,
maybe I'm missing something,

21:38.506 --> 21:40.588
but this doesn't exactly spell foul play.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.260
It reads, "Stayed at friend's house last
night. Everything fine. Love you."

21:45.513 --> 21:48.380
Now, while we're as close
as any family can be,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.716
there are certain things
Jackson has not been able to say

21:50.935 --> 21:52.471
since the day we told him
he was adopted.

21:52.687 --> 21:53.972
Things like what?

21:54.731 --> 21:57.063
Jackson never says, "I love you."

21:58.318 --> 22:00.684
- Never?
- Not once in 11 years.

22:02.071 --> 22:05.484
So, who did you say
you were studying with tonight?

22:06.993 --> 22:08.153
Just Lydia.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.155
We're prepping
for our world history midterm.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.697
History was one of my favorites,
especially military history.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.627
Ever hear the phrase,
"Know thy enemy"?

22:16.836 --> 22:19.122
It's from "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.879
Very good. Know what it means?

22:22.759 --> 22:26.126
In order to win a battle, one must know
everything they can about their enemy.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.128
Right again.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.514
Your father and I happen to be having
that very problem.

22:31.726 --> 22:35.639
We've got an enemy
about which we know next to nothing.

22:36.397 --> 22:38.388
It's killed one of our own,
among others.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.942
I've heard.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.651
Did you hear Jackson Whittemore
didn't show to school today?

22:45.782 --> 22:46.897
He didn't?

22:48.701 --> 22:51.534
His parents called and so did the police.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.570
You wouldn't know anything about that,
would you?

22:59.712 --> 23:01.498
Well, let me tell you what I know.

23:01.714 --> 23:06.174
I know that a teenager's first instinct
is to protect their friends.

23:07.220 --> 23:11.509
And I believe my granddaughter
would always want to protect her friends,

23:11.724 --> 23:13.680
even if it meant lying.

23:13.893 --> 23:19.638
So I want to ask one more question
and this time, with a small advantage.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.432
I'm not going to hurt you.

23:23.862 --> 23:26.274
I just want to get a sense of your pulse.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.281
Think of it as a game.
All you have to do is tell the truth.

23:32.161 --> 23:35.198
Do you know anything
about Jackson being missing?

23:37.292 --> 23:38.327
No.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.416
Is he in trouble?

23:40.628 --> 23:43.085
I don't know. I don't know.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.793
Does this have
anything to do with Scott?

23:46.009 --> 23:49.376
No. I mean, I don't... I don't know.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.513
Your pulse jumped.

23:55.935 --> 23:59.644
- It's because you're scaring me.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.472
That was definitely going way too far.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.605
No kidding.

24:03.776 --> 24:07.189
It wasn't right for me to use
tactics like that. I'm sorry.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.482
You can go back to class.

24:17.707 --> 24:18.787
Go ahead.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.646
Scott.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.020
Scott.

24:45.610 --> 24:51.446
I'm afraid your teacher was feeling ill today
and had to leave early.

24:52.700 --> 24:56.318
So, unfortunately,
you're stuck with me as a substitute.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.662
Can anyone catch me up to speed
on where we are?

25:04.170 --> 25:06.252
Mr. McCall, how about you?

25:14.055 --> 25:15.591
Scales?

25:15.765 --> 25:18.222
- Like a fish?
- No, more like a reptile.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.598
And your claws have this liquid
that paralyzes people,

25:22.814 --> 25:24.850
and you have a tail.

25:25.066 --> 25:27.523
- l have a tail?
- Yeah, you have a tail.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.442
- Does it do anything?
- No, not that I know of.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.896
Can I use it to strangle you?

25:34.075 --> 25:36.487
Yeah. You still don't believe me. All right.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.160
The night of the semi-final game,
what did you do right after?

25:39.330 --> 25:42.037
- I went home.
- Are you sure about that?

25:42.250 --> 25:44.491
Yes, you idiot.
What the hell else would I do?

25:44.711 --> 25:47.373
You attacked me and Derek at the school
and you trapped us in the pool.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.878
You also killed a mechanic.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.084
Right in front of me, by the way.
That was lovely.

25:51.259 --> 25:52.590
And one of Argent's hunters.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.251
Oh, and last night,
you tried to kill Danny.

25:55.430 --> 25:57.386
Why would I want to
kill my best friend?

25:57.598 --> 26:00.214
Well, that's what Scott's out
trying to figure out right now.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.554
Mmm. What maybe he should be
trying to figure out

26:02.770 --> 26:04.226
is how he's going to pay for a lawyer

26:04.439 --> 26:07.101
when l prosecute your asses
all the way to jail!

26:07.859 --> 26:09.690
All right, well, tell me this.

26:10.236 --> 26:13.103
On the night of the first full moon,
what happened?

26:14.115 --> 26:15.321
Nothing.

26:17.535 --> 26:18.866
Nothing happened.

26:28.379 --> 26:29.664
Allison.

26:32.383 --> 26:36.092
We've noticed quite a few calls
from your phone to the odd one.

26:36.304 --> 26:37.293
Sfilinski.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.463
Oh, you told me to keep an eye on Lydia

26:39.640 --> 26:42.052
and he's had a crush on her
since, like, third grade,

26:42.268 --> 26:44.634
so I'm gonna have to talk to him.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.645
I know it's hard,

26:48.816 --> 26:51.683
sitting here, trying not to look at him.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.403
But think of how strong it makes you.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.490
Especially when all these other girls

26:59.702 --> 27:02.739
are just letting their entire
high school lives be defined by some boy

27:02.955 --> 27:05.662
they're just praying
will take them to senior prom.

27:07.251 --> 27:11.039
- Can't I be strong and go to prom?
- Of course.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.629
But with someone else.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.794
Remember,
so long as you stay strong,

27:21.516 --> 27:24.303
we won't have to kill a 16-year-old boy.

27:46.624 --> 27:47.784
Oh, my God.

27:48.209 --> 27:49.915
- They know.
- What?

27:50.128 --> 27:51.368
They know Jackson's missing.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.452
No, they can't. I've been
texting his parents since last night.

27:53.673 --> 27:54.503
They don't have a clue.

27:54.715 --> 27:57.047
My grandfather told me
his parents went to the police.

27:57.218 --> 27:58.674
They know.

28:02.598 --> 28:03.553
Oh!

28:04.225 --> 28:05.385
Chuck that.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.471
All available units proceed
to Beacon Hills Preserve as instructed.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.478
Proceed with caution
until Sheriff Stilinski's arrival.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.981
Repeat. Proceed with caution.

28:24.704 --> 28:27.741
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere very far from this.

28:33.296 --> 28:34.331
"Jackson?"

28:35.423 --> 28:37.914
You sure everything's okay
between you and Jackson?

28:38.134 --> 28:39.499
Yeah, everything's fine.

28:43.681 --> 28:46.047
Did the cops have to take my fake ID?

28:47.143 --> 28:50.226
- You didn't do anything to make him angry?
- How angry?

28:50.438 --> 28:51.598
On a scale of I to 10,

28:51.814 --> 28:57.354
I being "kind of irritated,"
and 10 "wanting to kill you violently."

28:57.570 --> 29:01.904
Jackson's kind of always at a 4,
but we're good.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.656
l was actually doing him a favor.

29:05.369 --> 29:06.484
What favor?

29:06.704 --> 29:09.320
l was recovering a video for him.
I put it on my tablet.

29:10.625 --> 29:15.289
Which is in the trunk of my car
and probably still at the club.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.923
What was on the video?

29:18.174 --> 29:19.710
I'm not really supposed to say.

29:19.926 --> 29:22.508
Danny, what if I told you
this could be a matter of life and death?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.676
I'm not supposed to say.

29:26.182 --> 29:27.137
Okay.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.101
What if I told you
you can get your fake ID back?

29:37.693 --> 29:40.901
While I think you being here to check in
on your friend is all sorts of commendable,

29:41.113 --> 29:45.277
I've gotta play tough mom right now,
even though I'm not very good at it.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.108
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.740
I got a call from your principal.
You are failing two classes?

29:49.956 --> 29:52.117
I know. And that's why
I'm studying with Stiles right now.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.745
Do you know that if you fail
even one of your midterms,

29:54.961 --> 29:56.952
that they're gonna hold you back?

29:57.171 --> 29:58.672
- He said that?
- Yes.

29:59.507 --> 30:02.624
All of your friends are gonna be juniors
while you are still a sophomore.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.880
Do you understand, Scott?
You cannot fail.

30:06.097 --> 30:07.086
I know.

30:07.682 --> 30:08.671
Okay.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.548
Thank you.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.927
If Jackson doesn't remember
being the Kanima,

30:52.101 --> 30:54.513
he's definitely not gonna remember
stealing Danny's tablet.

30:54.729 --> 30:57.471
Why would he steal the thing
if he doesn't even know what's on it?

30:57.690 --> 30:59.305
What if someone else took it?

30:59.525 --> 31:01.186
Then somebody else knows what he is.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.191
Which could mean
someone's protecting him.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.648
Like the bestiary says,
"The Kanima seeks a friend," right?

31:05.865 --> 31:07.150
Okay, hold on.

31:07.325 --> 31:10.783
So somebody watches Jackson make
a video of himself turning into the Kanima

31:10.953 --> 31:13.160
and then just erases part of it
so he wouldn't know?

31:13.539 --> 31:14.949
I mean, who would do that?

31:15.166 --> 31:17.999
- Somebody who wanted to protect him?
- There's something else.

31:18.210 --> 31:21.373
You said the only thing you found online about
the Kanima is that it goes after murderers.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.913
- What if that's actually true?
- Well, no, it can't be.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.501
It tried to kill all of us, remember?

31:26.260 --> 31:28.922
I don't know about you two,
but I haven't murdered anybody lately.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.345
But I don't think
that it was actually trying to kill us.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.346
Remember when we were
at Isaac's the first time,

31:33.517 --> 31:36.179
- itjust went right by us, didn't it?
- You're right, itjust ran off.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.477
And it didn't kill you
in the mechanic's garage.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.600
Well, yeah, but it tried to kill me
and Derek in the pool.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.022
- Did it?
- It would've.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.099
It was waiting for us to come out.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.064
What if it was trying to keep you in?

31:47.615 --> 31:49.526
Why do I feel so violated all of a sudden?

31:49.742 --> 31:52.484
Because there's something else going on.
We don't know what it is.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.489
We don't know anything
about what's going on with Jackson

31:54.705 --> 31:57.822
- or why someone's protecting him.
- "Know thy enemy."

31:58.042 --> 32:00.249
Just something my grandfather said.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.286
All right, I got it. Kill Jackson.
Problem solved.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.831
He risked his life for us.
Against Peter, you remember that?

32:07.051 --> 32:10.009
Yes, but what did we just find out?
He got the bite from Derek.

32:10.179 --> 32:12.090
It's funny how he just got
exactly what he wanted

32:12.306 --> 32:14.137
by supposedly risking his life for us,
it's funny.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.716
Yeah, it doesn't mean
he's not still worth saving.

32:17.353 --> 32:18.809
It's always something with him, though.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.890
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- So what?

32:21.065 --> 32:22.851
So, I didn't either.

32:26.195 --> 32:28.106
You remember when
I almost killed you and Jackson?

32:30.324 --> 32:33.361
I had someone to stop me.
He has nobody.

32:34.370 --> 32:35.826
That's his own fault.

32:36.497 --> 32:37.737
Doesn't matter.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.657
If we can save him, we should try.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.189
Stiles went to check on Lydia.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.858
She still hasn't forgiven him
for promising to talk to her

33:16.078 --> 33:18.239
and then ditching her at her car.

33:18.456 --> 33:20.572
That's not easy to explain.

33:27.965 --> 33:30.377
How did your dad know
where to be last night?

33:31.510 --> 33:34.172
He was there in the alley.
Him and Gerard.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.717
They have people.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.174
Guys who monitor every camera in town.

33:40.394 --> 33:42.510
ATMs, traffic cameras.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.054
Have you seen the ones
they put up in school?

33:49.403 --> 33:51.644
- You thought I told him.
- No.

33:52.281 --> 33:53.771
I don't know, ljust...

33:55.951 --> 33:57.236
I don't know, ljust...

33:58.704 --> 34:00.365
I'm on your side, Scott.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.205
I'm always on your side.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.579
I know.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.412
I know. I'm sorry.

34:12.426 --> 34:13.666
I'm sorry.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.386
Just that I thought that things
would get back to normal by now.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.515
Or at least normal enough
so I could pass my classes.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.058
You'll pass.

34:48.504 --> 34:51.667
- Could you put some music on? Please?
- Yeah, you want the radio?

34:51.924 --> 34:53.664
Use Entune. It has Pandora.

34:57.263 --> 35:00.050
I felt like I was gonna
fall asleep in your arms.

35:01.684 --> 35:03.470
I like it when you fall asleep in my arms.

35:03.686 --> 35:04.926
I don't.

35:05.229 --> 35:07.641
I wake up, you're always gone.

35:08.857 --> 35:11.269
That's only because
I don't want to wake you.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.609
I'd ratherjust wake up with you.

35:15.239 --> 35:16.649
You will.

35:18.075 --> 35:21.363
High school's only two more years.

35:23.414 --> 35:26.201
Which is hard enough
for normal people to get through.

35:30.713 --> 35:33.295
Hey, what would you say
if I could be normal?

35:37.386 --> 35:40.628
I've been thinking about it
ever since we saw her at the hospital.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.930
Lydia was bit by an Alpha, right?

35:44.143 --> 35:48.136
Peter told Stiles that if the bite
doesn't turn you, it'll kill you.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.896
But nothing happened to Lydia.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.682
Meaning?

35:52.901 --> 35:54.277
Meaning what, she's immune?

35:54.486 --> 35:56.351
If she is, doesn't that...

35:56.947 --> 35:59.654
Doesn't immunity mean
that you could be cured?

36:05.247 --> 36:06.487
Would you want that?

36:07.207 --> 36:09.493
I want anything that lets me be with you.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.457
And notjust till the end of high school.

36:15.299 --> 36:18.132
Well, then you better not get into
too good of a college.

36:18.302 --> 36:19.633
My grades suck.

36:20.596 --> 36:22.302
Not just fill college.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.266
I'm serious.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.769
I know.

36:34.276 --> 36:35.311
I know.

38:00.696 --> 38:02.652
You guys might wanna come
take a look at this.

38:08.287 --> 38:09.868
l have to tell my father.

38:13.584 --> 38:14.664
Scott.

38:16.170 --> 38:18.126
He's going to kill someone.

38:19.757 --> 38:22.669
Okay, tell him.
Tell him everything.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.129
Scott, I gotta tell mine, too.

38:26.096 --> 38:28.382
- This is all my fault.
- It's not.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.184
But we have to tell them.
We're just a bunch of teenagers.

38:31.393 --> 38:33.008
We can't handle this.

38:33.562 --> 38:34.722
You're right.

38:35.189 --> 38:37.054
How you gonna make your dad
believe all this?

38:37.691 --> 38:39.022
I don't know.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.405
He'll believe me.

39:00.798 --> 39:02.288
You scared the hell out of me.

39:02.466 --> 39:04.627
I've been sitting here for an hour
waiting for you.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.299
I can't hang out right now, Lydia.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.798
I don't need anyone to hang out with.

39:10.557 --> 39:12.058
I need someone to talk to.

39:12.226 --> 39:14.763
I understand that it's important,
but if it can just wait.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.355
Why is everyone
always telling me to wait?

39:17.523 --> 39:19.559
Why can't anyone
have "right now" available?

39:19.733 --> 39:21.689
You can't have everything right now.

39:21.902 --> 39:23.017
You know what I need?

39:23.195 --> 39:25.857
I need someone to translate
five pages of archaic Latin.

39:26.073 --> 39:28.655
Obviously, that's not gonna happen
anytime soon.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.653
I know archaic Latin.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.278
- You know archaic Latin?
- I got bored with classical Latin.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.083
Just how smart are you?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.119
Just show me the pages.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.087
Could you buzz us in?
I gotta see my dad.

39:44.258 --> 39:45.373
Thanks.

40:03.527 --> 40:05.483
Scott, Stiles.

40:06.363 --> 40:07.819
Perfect timing.

40:10.117 --> 40:13.780
Have you met Jackson's father,
Mr. David Whittemore?

40:14.997 --> 40:16.112
Esquire.

40:17.124 --> 40:18.830
That means lawyer.

40:24.172 --> 40:25.332
Are you sure?

40:25.632 --> 40:28.499
Ms. Morrell said that word means "friend."
"The Kanima seeks a friend."

40:32.306 --> 40:34.171
"The Kanima seeks a master."

40:34.808 --> 40:36.594
Why? Is that important?

40:37.686 --> 40:38.641
Yeah.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.691
Someone's not protecting him.

40:47.905 --> 40:49.645
Someone's controlling him.
