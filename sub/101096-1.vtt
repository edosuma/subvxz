00:25.526 --> 00:28.296
(dramatic music)

01:45.739 --> 01:48.376
(ominous music)

02:23.911 --> 02:26.614
(crowd applauds)

02:27.781 --> 02:30.984
- And do we have a
peach of a day or not?

02:33.086 --> 02:36.424
You know, it's my
goal to get more jobs

02:36.457 --> 02:40.027
to the people of this
city than ever before.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.497
Well, we have here the
executive of Freedom Foods,

02:43.497 --> 02:45.499
and we have them
to thank for it,

02:45.499 --> 02:47.701
so let's give them a
big round of applause.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.438
(crowd applauds)

02:52.940 --> 02:55.309
- [Crowd] USA, USA, USA, USA!

02:58.446 --> 03:00.981
(playful music)

03:04.685 --> 03:06.887
(munching)

03:46.327 --> 03:47.561
(screaming)
(snoring)

03:47.561 --> 03:48.662
- [Man] Oh God, it's got teeth.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.198
Oh my God, let me through.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.433
(screams)

03:52.433 --> 03:54.402
- I forgot how to get--
- Better run, everybody.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.537
You can't stay, you can't stay.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.506
One pass and I'm done.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.608
I can't see.
- I can you.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.343
You're ascared of me.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.046
(growling)

04:06.079 --> 04:07.014
(gun fires)

04:07.014 --> 04:10.117
- Oh, hello, Principal Johnson.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.452
You just missed movie time.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.520
(bell rings)

04:12.553 --> 04:14.855
Oh.
(kids cheering)

04:14.855 --> 04:16.123
Alright, kids.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.625
Have a great weekend.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.060
I'll see you next week; one
more week of fifth grade.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.596
Try not to act, uh, too upset.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.034
- I just had to see for myself.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.202
Congratulations, Sam?

04:29.236 --> 04:31.305
This isn't exactly
school curriculum.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.274
- It's the second to last
Friday of the school year.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.609
I just thought I'd reward them

04:35.609 --> 04:37.611
with something a
little more fun.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.713
- What's Sam deserve
congratulating for?

04:39.747 --> 04:42.282
- He finally got one of his
films into a big film festival.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.283
- Oh!

04:43.283 --> 04:44.452
Did he?

04:44.485 --> 04:46.987
Oh, was it, Zombie
Space Vikings?

04:55.663 --> 04:57.297
Zombie Prom Night?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.933
- There's something
wrong with my face!

04:59.967 --> 05:01.935
(screaming)

05:01.935 --> 05:03.003
- Shirley no!

05:07.007 --> 05:09.076
- Or was it, uh,
something with babies?

05:09.109 --> 05:11.945
- Zombie Abortion Apocalypse.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.481
- Zembryos attack!

05:15.483 --> 05:18.452
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge!

05:18.452 --> 05:20.120
- Oh, oh, yeah that one, yeah.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.855
- You have to admire
his persistence.

05:21.855 --> 05:25.693
- Dear, persistence can
be a sign of insanity.

05:26.927 --> 05:27.761
- Hyyy-ya!

05:33.867 --> 05:35.202
- Easy.

05:35.268 --> 05:38.939
- That, boys and girls,
is our classic ninja

05:39.773 --> 05:41.174
zombie kill move.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.877
Well that's it for class today.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.346
Parents, you should be proud
of these little ninjas.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.115
- And remember, next
Tuesday is our home

05:48.148 --> 05:50.851
invasion defense workshop.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.352
- Yes parents,
it's good practice

05:52.352 --> 05:53.854
for those of you who do not
want your kids kidnapped,

05:53.854 --> 05:56.557
or raped, or raped
by kidnappers.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.561
- Kidnapping can really
stunt a child's development.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.529
- Hell yeah.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.499
* I can't buy you dinner

06:05.533 --> 06:07.735
- [Man] Popper, Popper!

06:07.735 --> 06:09.470
- Hey, what the shit?

06:11.038 --> 06:13.874
I'll just, I'll
just stay down here.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.809
- [Woman] You're gonna
want to get up for this.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.910
- Oh, I'm up.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.347
- What can I help you with?

06:20.347 --> 06:22.249
- Steve Popolopsis?

06:22.249 --> 06:24.485
- My friends call me Popper.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.219
What do they call you, baby?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.655
Hot Pink?

06:27.688 --> 06:31.925
- Oh you can call me
whatever you like, Popper,

06:31.925 --> 06:33.994
but you've been served.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.529
- Oh, shit.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.564
- Been served what?

06:36.564 --> 06:37.565
A sexy-gram?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.835
Fuckin' bitch.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.370
- I get that a bunch.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.039
You have a nice day, Mr. Popper.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.546
- Popper don't preach, bro,

06:52.580 --> 06:54.748
she done filed for D.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.049
(laughing)

06:56.049 --> 06:56.884
- Shut up.

06:57.885 --> 06:58.719
Shut up!

07:01.722 --> 07:05.058
- [Felecia] Mr.
Pentergass, we thank you

07:05.058 --> 07:08.696
for your short film submission,
Deadbeat Zombie Dad,

07:08.696 --> 07:11.398
to the 2016 horror film fest.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.434
We are sorry to inform
you Deadbeat Zombie Dad

07:14.434 --> 07:17.104
did not make our final
lineup in the festival.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.140
The truth is your movie
is a steaming pile

07:20.207 --> 07:22.776
of shitnuggets, with
the production value

07:22.776 --> 07:24.612
of a home video shot by a deaf,

07:24.612 --> 07:28.148
blind amputee that is
drunk on cheap gin.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.485
Please consider quitting
filmmaking altogether,

07:31.485 --> 07:33.821
maybe concentrating on
digging ditches full time.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.589
Hopefully you'll
perish in a fire

07:35.623 --> 07:37.825
or contract genital herpes.

07:38.992 --> 07:43.497
Warm regards, festival
director Felecia Fugate.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.398
- Sweetie, how's
my little Scorsese?

07:45.432 --> 07:48.769
- Uh, yeah, mom, just a second.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.604
- Sweetheart, I want that letter

07:50.604 --> 07:52.005
to put in your book.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.141
- This is not a
good time, alright?

07:54.141 --> 07:56.644
- Honey, all your
friends are here already.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.478
You've gotta come out.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.249
Now get your tail out
here, you're being rude!

08:06.520 --> 08:08.421
(upbeat music)

08:08.455 --> 08:09.289
- Hey.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.768
- Hey.
- Hey, congratulations.

08:20.768 --> 08:21.835
- Yeah, thanks for coming.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
- Course.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.538
- Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.340
- Hey, Horatio.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.109
- Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam!

08:30.377 --> 08:34.381
Well, I guess a
congratulations is in order.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.383
- Thank you.
- Sam, Sam.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.353
It is not that I don't--

08:40.387 --> 08:41.722
- 'Scuse me, bro.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.791
- Hey, man.
- Guys look!

08:45.025 --> 08:45.893
Stoner cam!

08:47.527 --> 08:48.696
- Hey that's awesome, man.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.697
That's really cool.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.199
- It's great, it really was,

08:52.199 --> 08:55.035
It's not that I don't
like Zombie Dad,

08:55.068 --> 08:58.906
it's just that it is
lacking something.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.174
It's just, it's
lacking something.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.042
How would one say?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.510
It is...

09:03.510 --> 09:05.178
It is complete shit, Sam.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.715
It is complete and utter shit.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.550
Because you casted
amateurs, Sam.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.319
Amateurs.
- Oh, yeah.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.554
- And I know that Ocean Spray
has his Megacuts commercial,

09:14.554 --> 09:15.889
I know that.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.090
I know that but I--
- Yeah it's a good commercial.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.258
- It's a pretty good commercial,

09:18.325 --> 09:19.326
I will say that.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.394
But everybody else, Sam--

09:21.394 --> 09:22.596
- I'll be thinking

09:22.663 --> 09:24.164
about you when I
drop this deuce.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.934
I've got a turtlehead saying
let me out, let me out.

09:26.934 --> 09:27.868
Move, bitch.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.070
- No, Tibo, I actually really--

09:30.070 --> 09:33.607
- That was lovely,
Tibo, thank you.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.842
- M-hmm.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.043
- It is a wonder,
Mr. Pentergass--

09:36.076 --> 09:37.077
- Yes.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.045
- If you're even
talented at all.

09:38.045 --> 09:38.946
- Great.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.748
Thank you so much, Horatio.

09:40.748 --> 09:44.251
Do you mind if I just
kinda have my party?

09:44.284 --> 09:45.953
- I'm leaving now, Sam.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.520
- Okay.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.521
Thanks, thanks for coming.

09:48.521 --> 09:49.723
Awesome, Sam.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.024
How you gonna get
out of this one?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.193
It's not like you can
say, whoops, sorry,

09:53.193 --> 09:56.029
I didn't actually
read the letter.

09:56.029 --> 09:59.132
(upbeat music)

09:59.132 --> 10:01.902
- You're like a legit
filmmaker now, bro!

10:01.935 --> 10:03.603
We should team up, you
know, make a movie,

10:03.603 --> 10:06.239
like, what if like
two guys travel across

10:06.273 --> 10:10.778
the country on their motorcycles
in search of America?

10:11.812 --> 10:13.313
- Yeah, man, um...

10:15.282 --> 10:17.785
I think that's already
might've already kinda

10:17.785 --> 10:19.119
been done, but we can
do something else--

10:19.119 --> 10:20.988
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.222
Alright, I got another one.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.924
I got another one.
- Okay, alright, yeah.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.325
- Two guys.
- Okay.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.327
- Wake up in the morning,

10:27.327 --> 10:29.162
and their car is gone.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.464
- Yeah.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.632
Yup.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.001
- What was up with that
cheer uniform today?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.102
I saw you at the rally.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.436
- Shut it down...

10:36.436 --> 10:37.938
- You were looking
awfully cheerful.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.007
- The new owners are making
that place my prison.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.274
- Mmm.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.442
- But I got paid
one hundred bucks

10:42.442 --> 10:43.643
to put on the costume.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.577
- Hiiya!

10:44.611 --> 10:45.445
- Oh!

10:45.478 --> 10:46.479
Alright, alright.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.848
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.450
- Hey, hey baby.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.585
- Die, asshole.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.354
- Oh, asshole, sass, I dig.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.856
You like to party?

10:55.856 --> 10:56.857
- You wanna play?

10:56.857 --> 10:57.958
- Mmm, yeah I wanna play.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.992
- You wouldn't get anywhere near

10:58.992 --> 11:02.329
this unless I was dead, or dead.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.664
You have poop on your shirt.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.299
It's gross.
- Hi, y'all!

11:06.333 --> 11:09.502
I have some Freedom Cakes
fresh from the factory.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.771
Eat 'em all up!

11:11.705 --> 11:12.706
- I'm alright.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.640
Thanks.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.775
- Aw, they're good.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.943
You have a good time!

11:15.976 --> 11:17.644
- Thanks, Ms. Ecky.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.678
- I think I'm going to vomit.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.047
- Yeah, vomit.

11:20.047 --> 11:22.649
- Sam, I, I had my
kids make you cards.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.817
- Nice.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.952
Thank you.

11:24.952 --> 11:28.155
Oh.
- Yeah, and this one's mine.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.022
- Nice!

11:37.297 --> 11:38.131
Bros.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.202
- Fuck off!

11:42.202 --> 11:43.737
- Hey, hey.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.139
- Your hair looks like my
cousin's bleached asshole.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.808
- Why you got so
much aggression?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.509
Be so pretty.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.212
Your cousin bleaches
her asshole?

11:53.413 --> 11:56.884
Hey neighbor, you like
to party and get naked?

11:58.485 --> 11:59.352
I eat butt.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.757
And not just on Fridays.

12:03.824 --> 12:04.992
- You see that Tiffany chick?

12:04.992 --> 12:06.026
She's here.

12:06.059 --> 12:06.894
- Tiffany?

12:06.894 --> 12:08.061
- Yeah.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.262
Dude, I think she's
in the kitchen.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.163
- Yeah.

12:10.163 --> 12:10.998
- She's really here?

12:10.998 --> 12:12.199
- Yeah.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.666
She's like an angel,
man, I'm telling you.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.902
I talked to her for a minute.

12:14.902 --> 12:15.735
- Oh yeah?

12:15.735 --> 12:16.569
- Yeah.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.405
- We're twins.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.773
- Twins?

12:19.840 --> 12:20.673
Really?

12:21.942 --> 12:23.610
- Identical.

12:23.676 --> 12:24.677
- Identical.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.353
- Hey guys.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.554
- Hey.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.756
- Sammy finally has
a ticket out of here.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.558
And a girl like Tiffany
only thinks about

12:38.558 --> 12:41.261
one thing; getting out.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.530
- What are we talking about?

12:43.563 --> 12:44.965
- Tiffany Taylor.

12:46.699 --> 12:47.901
She's blonde.

12:47.935 --> 12:48.936
- Mm...

12:48.936 --> 12:50.370
- I touched her hair over there.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.905
- Oh...

12:51.939 --> 12:53.240
- Oh man, did you tell

12:53.240 --> 12:54.441
her that you were
going to do that?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.876
- No I just went
by and I swiped it.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.411
(upbeat music)

12:58.445 --> 12:59.446
- Oh!

12:59.446 --> 13:01.114
Peter Anthony!

13:01.114 --> 13:02.449

13:02.449 --> 13:03.550
- Yes he did.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.152
And he's gotta go say something.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.386
He can't just like, sit there.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.587
You gotta go get him
to make a speech.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.889
- I think this could
be a good thing

13:08.889 --> 13:09.823
because he is such a
good public speaker.

13:09.823 --> 13:10.958
- Honey, please!

13:10.958 --> 13:13.626
Oh, don't you be nasty!

19:54.961 --> 19:58.298
* I don't want her
- Come on, let's go!

19:58.298 --> 19:59.532
- Dude!

19:59.532 --> 20:00.733
You want to take a shit?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.369
I've got a big yard.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.203
Neighbors would love

20:15.982 --> 20:17.484
- No problem, man.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.257
You're already drinking?

20:24.257 --> 20:27.527
- Well it's Saturday, so
I'm gonna get fucked up.

20:27.560 --> 20:32.265
And then there's Janice,
bitch is divorcing me,

20:32.265 --> 20:33.700
so I hope she gets
genital herpes

20:33.733 --> 20:36.736
and poison ivy on her nipples
in the same afternoon.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.071
Fuck it, I'm getting wrecked!

20:40.773 --> 20:42.775
You're a fuckin' mad
man lying about getting

20:42.775 --> 20:44.511
into the festival.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.578
- Wait, what?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.047
- Yeah, you said we
were going to get

20:48.047 --> 20:50.016
an apartment in L.A., asshole.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.520
- Yeah, I was totally
gonna get laid by a girl.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.754
- And I think you
should be with me

20:54.754 --> 20:56.689
at the premiere and that's,

20:56.723 --> 20:59.392
it's gonna be good
for everybody.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.593
And wait no,

21:00.593 --> 21:03.029
I don't even know--

21:03.062 --> 21:04.297
- You know you are a dick.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.466
And I don't, know--
- Rejection letter?

21:06.466 --> 21:08.468
- You shouldn't read that
because here's the thing.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.936
- No!
- No because I'm gonna go,

21:09.936 --> 21:11.270
because I'm gonna because
I talked to his agent.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.473
(laughing)

21:14.807 --> 21:16.042
Shit.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.377
- You know folks are
going to have a heyday

21:17.377 --> 21:18.378

21:18.378 --> 21:21.481
But don't worry about us, Sam,

21:21.481 --> 21:24.584
I never really

- Thanks?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.054
- You're welcome.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.221
Dumbass.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.289
I mean, the head
smash in this last one

21:30.289 --> 21:31.991
was the best one ever.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.126
- Can you not hit
so many bumps, Tibo?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.562
I know I'm five minutes younger

21:35.595 --> 21:37.997
than you but shit,
learn to drive, man.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.099
- Look man, that's what you
get for polluting your body.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.469
I told you before, your
body is your temple.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.136
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.606
- Oh my gosh, are you really
bringing that up right now?

21:46.639 --> 21:49.742
The person who jerks
off to pregnancy videos?

21:49.742 --> 21:50.910
Yeah, tell 'em, Tibo.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.112
Tell everybody
Tibo your darkness,

21:53.145 --> 21:56.349
your dark secrets of the
of the mom's birthing

21:56.349 --> 21:58.818
and the babies coming
out of the vagina.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.687
And he jerks off to that.

22:00.753 --> 22:01.854
Argh, I need to stop.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.022
- Dude, what?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.991
- Listen, they're
not pregnancy videos,

22:04.991 --> 22:05.992
they're birthing videos.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.193
Pregnancy videos are nasty.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.696
Birthing videos are
sexy and they're art.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.997
- Whatever, your
temple's just wrong.

22:10.997 --> 22:11.998
- Dude.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.833
- I haven't even tried that.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.101
- Oh it's good, you
should try it, man.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.303
- Okay, okay, it
gets kind of hot,

22:17.336 --> 22:18.538
but it shouldn't be hot.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.772
- See, when you see
those thighs open wide

22:19.806 --> 22:23.476
and that water break
and, and she's wet, yo.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.477
- Ah!

22:24.477 --> 22:25.645
Oh God!

22:25.678 --> 22:28.180
(yelling)

22:28.180 --> 22:29.015
- Ow.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.218
- Is that a walker?

22:32.218 --> 22:34.887
We almost had
grandma in the grill.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.056
- What's wrong with her?

22:37.123 --> 22:38.124
- She's old?

22:41.494 --> 22:42.361
Mrs. Henry?

22:43.563 --> 22:46.966
Mrs. Henry we are so
sorry, are you okay?

22:46.999 --> 22:47.867
Mrs. Henry?

22:50.369 --> 22:51.738
Hey, you alright?

22:53.139 --> 22:56.242
Let's get you back
to your house okay?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.815
Okay, here we go, there we go.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.818
I love what you did
with your flowers.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.987
(farting)

23:16.829 --> 23:17.664
Oh, okay.

23:19.031 --> 23:22.201
Okay, Mrs. Henry I'm
just gonna head back in,

23:22.234 --> 23:25.104
you got it from
here, right, yeah?

23:25.104 --> 23:28.775
Okay, okay, uh, you
should change your pants

23:30.877 --> 23:32.912
- Did you hear that shit?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.347
I mean, I'm gonna need
therapy after that,

23:35.381 --> 23:36.883
or a birthing video.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.118
- Guys can we please just go?

23:39.118 --> 23:41.688
It's like a dutch oven in here.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.224
- You know what, there
hasn't been a brother

23:45.257 --> 23:47.594
like that in the state since,

23:47.594 --> 23:50.362
and he gave him
the ol' dipsy-do.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.265
- [Waitress] Hi, what
can I get for you?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.266
- Just a root beer float.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.268
- [Waitress] You got it.

23:59.939 --> 24:03.442
- Hey, you're Pistol
Love's nephew aren't you?

24:03.442 --> 24:04.644
- Yeah.

24:04.711 --> 24:08.114
- Man, we were just
talking about him.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.249
Hey listen, let me ask
you somethin', son.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.784
What's this bullshit
lies we've been hearing

24:11.784 --> 24:15.955
about you winning some
sort of award or something?

24:17.223 --> 24:19.559
- Uh, yeah, it was more
of a misunderstanding.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.427
I didn't win anything.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.130
(sniffing)

24:24.130 --> 24:27.967
- I smell bullshit boy, a
big ol' steaming pile of it!

24:27.967 --> 24:30.436
- Tell 'em, daddy!
- Why don't you get

24:30.469 --> 24:33.506
yourself a job and contribute
something to society.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.441
- Yo, Spielberg!

24:35.474 --> 24:36.676
Nice one, guy.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.845
I heard you notched
up another rejection?

24:38.911 --> 24:42.515
Going for a Guinness
world record?

24:42.515 --> 24:44.016
- How did you guys
hear about this?

24:44.016 --> 24:47.186
- I saw it on Instagram,
I saw it on Instagram,

24:47.253 --> 24:50.322
Instagram, Instagram,
Instagram, son.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.426
- [Sam] And now the young
have shown up to feed.

24:54.426 --> 24:56.428
I'm like an Easter ham.

24:56.428 --> 25:01.100
This town is going to be
chewing on my gristle for years.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.978
- Well, if he's gone he's gone,

25:13.012 --> 25:14.513
we still gotta paint.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.848
And pick up two weeks
of dog shit 'cause

25:15.848 --> 25:17.717
we're late again.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.819
- Well I got good
news and good news;

25:19.852 --> 25:21.688
Patton's gone and I'm divorced.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.022
Let's paint.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.658
(upbeat music)

25:33.299 --> 25:35.902
Aw Jojo, you're killing me, man.

25:35.902 --> 25:36.869
That ain't painting music,

25:36.869 --> 25:38.504
we need some rock n' roll.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.306
- Asian is good, too.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.674
- Asian music?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.710
- Zen, my brother.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.211
- What happened to you?

25:45.211 --> 25:46.879
Help me out
Sam-alam-a-ding-dong,

25:46.879 --> 25:50.049
what kind of music do
you like to listen to?

25:50.049 --> 25:51.050
Sammy?

25:51.083 --> 25:52.218
You alright up there?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.419
- Yeah, all good, man.

25:53.485 --> 25:54.587
- Quit napping on
the job, bitch.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.088
Who wants a beer?

25:56.088 --> 25:57.323
- I'm good.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.725
- Guys, something was
wrong with her eyes.

25:58.725 --> 25:59.992
- Whose eyes?

26:00.026 --> 26:02.061
- It wasn't her eyes
that were the problem,

26:02.061 --> 26:03.663
it was her ass.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.264
Popper?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.699
- It was her ass.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.268
- Sam.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.402
Sam?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.404
What are you looking at?

26:13.505 --> 26:14.506
- I don't know, man.

26:14.506 --> 26:15.875
Give me a second.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.511
Uh, guys, we got
a problem up here.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.414
- Yeah, we don't
have enough beer.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.249
- Shit!

26:23.249 --> 26:24.516
Go, go, go!

26:24.550 --> 26:25.718
We've got a problem,
we've got a problem.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.219
- Yo, yo, what the
fuck's the problem, man?

26:27.219 --> 26:28.855
- The colonel, man,
he's fucked up!

26:28.855 --> 26:29.889
Hide!
- Be careful, man.

26:29.922 --> 26:30.857
Slow down, man!

26:30.857 --> 26:32.091
- Hey!
- Come on!

26:32.091 --> 26:35.862
- What, is he
butt-naked or something?

26:35.895 --> 26:37.096
- Sam!

26:37.096 --> 26:37.930
- Shit!

26:37.964 --> 26:38.798
Agh!

26:39.699 --> 26:40.532
Ah, shit!

26:42.468 --> 26:44.637
(yelling)

26:45.805 --> 26:47.774
- Go, go, go, go, go!

26:47.774 --> 26:49.075
- Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

26:49.108 --> 26:50.276
- Go, go, go, Popper!

26:50.276 --> 26:51.878
Go Popper!

26:51.911 --> 26:52.712
- Shit!

26:52.712 --> 26:53.545
Shit, shit, shit!

26:53.545 --> 26:54.714
- Hey, watch out!

26:54.714 --> 26:55.715
- Hey, what are you doing?

26:55.715 --> 26:56.548
Wait, wait!

26:56.582 --> 26:57.817
He's our only client!

26:57.817 --> 26:58.918
- I know.

26:58.951 --> 26:59.886
- What the fuck?

26:59.886 --> 27:01.220
- Everybody move!

27:03.389 --> 27:05.424
(yelling)

27:05.457 --> 27:07.660
- Shit that wasn't even close!

27:07.660 --> 27:08.995
What is that?

27:08.995 --> 27:10.229
You had one shot!

27:10.262 --> 27:12.564
- We'll be back once
you fix yo' shit.

27:12.564 --> 27:15.501
And sorry about your chair.

27:15.501 --> 27:17.103
Let's get the fuck out of here.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.604
- No, Jojo, let's stick around,

27:18.604 --> 27:19.739
maybe play a little Backgammon.

27:19.739 --> 27:20.740
- Did you see his face?

27:20.740 --> 27:22.074
Did you see that shit?

27:22.108 --> 27:23.943
- He's possessed by a demon!

27:23.943 --> 27:25.277
Probably that Asian curse.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.679
- There ain't no Asian
curse, it's rabies,

27:26.679 --> 27:29.949
and I ain't getting
18 shots in my abs.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.586
- What the hell is that?

27:36.756 --> 27:37.589
- Patton.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.027
- Oh that's rabies.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.765
- Well that's one dog
you're better than, Sam.

27:46.999 --> 27:47.800
What the hell are you
going to do with that?

27:47.800 --> 27:48.968
Cook him to death?

27:49.001 --> 27:51.170
- You guys got
all the good shit.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.371
I'm trying my best.

27:52.438 --> 27:53.773
- Shut up, guys.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.645
Alright we're gonna make
a run for it, alright?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.013
We're gonna get to the van,

28:01.013 --> 28:02.214
we're gonna lock the doors,

28:02.281 --> 28:03.382
we're gonna get the
fuck off this street.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.617
- Alright, let's do it.

28:05.651 --> 28:09.555
- Jojo, the ladle, man,
you look ridiculous.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.123
(glass breaking)

28:11.157 --> 28:11.991
- My bad.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.160
- Time to go, boys.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.061
- Come on!

28:15.061 --> 28:16.128
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

28:16.162 --> 28:17.196
- Stupid ass.

28:19.866 --> 28:20.867
- Who's got the keys?

28:20.867 --> 28:22.234
- Me, me, me, me!

28:26.238 --> 28:28.908
- Go, come on, come on, come on!

28:28.975 --> 28:30.209
Popper come on!

28:34.346 --> 28:36.816
Get the door, get it!

28:36.816 --> 28:37.649
- Get the keys!

28:37.649 --> 28:38.818
Let's go!

28:38.851 --> 28:41.888
Put they keys in
there, come on, man!

28:44.757 --> 28:45.724
Go, go, go!

28:45.724 --> 28:47.760
Would you just please go?

28:47.827 --> 28:48.660
Tibo!

28:50.196 --> 28:51.030
Go!

28:55.367 --> 28:56.702
- Shit, man.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.404
- Oh fuck.
- We need to call the police.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.705
- What?
- We need to call the police.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.941
- We are two months
behind on our dojo rent,

29:01.941 --> 29:03.175
he's our only client.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.244
- Okay, at the very
least we have to contact

29:05.244 --> 29:07.046
the Humane Society
and report this.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.181
- You might as well
report Sam too.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.517
Hey, he's the one
feeding Noodles vomit

29:11.517 --> 29:13.352
pudding on the floor.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.553
- You guys don't
even fuckin' care.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.554
- Sam.

29:15.554 --> 29:16.555
- What?

29:16.555 --> 29:17.623
- Your place.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.459
- What the hell?

29:21.560 --> 29:22.428
- Hey guys!

29:24.630 --> 29:26.232
- Pam!

29:26.265 --> 29:28.200
Uh, what are you doing here?

29:28.200 --> 29:29.035
Guys.

29:29.035 --> 29:29.869
- What?

29:29.869 --> 29:31.203
I ain't saying nothin'.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.538
- What are you doing here?

29:32.538 --> 29:35.474
- Oh, uh, I knocked
and the door was open,

29:35.474 --> 29:38.644
and I came in and saw
the place and, well.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.312
It was not big deal.

29:43.115 --> 29:43.983
- Thank you.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.784
- No big deal?

29:45.784 --> 29:48.287
There was vomit
like, everywhere.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.822
- There was?

29:49.822 --> 29:50.957
- [Announcer] We interrupt
your regular programing.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.458
- Holy crap!

29:52.458 --> 29:53.459
- [Announcer] This is the
emergency broadcast system.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.294
This is not a test.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.629
Repeat, this is not a test.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.065
State and local
authorities have issued

29:59.098 --> 30:00.933
a countywide warning.
- Sam.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.135
- [Announcer] Stay indoors,
lock all doors and windows.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.303
- Holy shit.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.771
- The authorities will
be issuing further

30:05.804 --> 30:09.842
instructions through the
emergency broadcast system.

30:14.513 --> 30:18.951
- Sam, is that your mailman
chasing Mrs. Henry's dog?

30:24.756 --> 30:27.459
(dramatic music)

30:33.165 --> 30:34.333
- Mom, please, please stop.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.301
Mom please!

30:35.334 --> 30:36.302
- There is something seriously

30:36.302 --> 30:37.336
wrong, your mom is whack.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.471
(moaning)

30:55.021 --> 30:57.523
(bright music)

31:09.068 --> 31:14.073
* Moments are such
fleeting things *

31:17.876 --> 31:20.546
* It's strange though

31:20.546 --> 31:24.050
* What rapture one brings

31:25.317 --> 31:26.152
- Sam?

31:26.152 --> 31:27.353
Sam, Sam!

31:27.386 --> 31:28.320
What the hell are
you doing, man?

31:28.320 --> 31:29.821
This is not a fucking movie!

31:29.855 --> 31:31.357
Come on, let's go!

31:31.357 --> 31:33.692
- Man we are not going to
survive without this weaponry.

31:33.692 --> 31:34.860
We need some damn guns.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.563
- I don't have any
guns, I have a camera.

31:37.563 --> 31:38.830
- Who gives a damn?

31:38.864 --> 31:41.033
- How are we the
only people in Texas

31:41.033 --> 31:42.701
that don't own guns?

31:44.336 --> 31:45.837
- Let's go to my uncle's!

31:45.837 --> 31:47.606
- [Together] Pistol's.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.410
- [DJ] Alright, let's
take a phone call here.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.279
Good morning, you're
live on the air

31:53.279 --> 31:55.347
with Morning Fiasco.

31:55.381 --> 31:56.448
There's nobody there.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.549
There's nobody there.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.884
Uh, guys?

31:58.884 --> 32:00.953
(yelling)

32:12.764 --> 32:15.534
(sirens blaring)

32:27.779 --> 32:29.548
- Looks like we've got company.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.050
Ready to whoop some
ass, little brother?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.119
- Yeah.
- (laughs) Let's go.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.620
- Wait!

32:34.620 --> 32:36.955
Yeah, they're just
regulars, man.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.491
- Let's whoop their ass anyway.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.935
- Pistol.

32:49.935 --> 32:51.437
You here?

32:51.470 --> 32:52.271
Uncle P!

32:53.472 --> 32:54.273
Pistol?

32:55.941 --> 32:56.742
Pistol!

32:58.110 --> 32:59.478
- What the hell is
going on here, huh?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.613
Somebody better
start talking, quick.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.349
- You want the short
or the long version?

33:03.349 --> 33:04.183
- Short.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.351
Very short.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.752
- Alright, so the town
has been overrun--

33:06.752 --> 33:08.320
- Corsicana has been overrun

33:08.320 --> 33:10.989
by bloodythirsty,
crazed zombies.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.991
They may be rabid.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.194
Either way it's very bad.

33:15.261 --> 33:17.129
We came to you for guns.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.765
- Hey, any of these work?

33:19.765 --> 33:21.967
- Does a pig shit turds, huh?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.169
- Mhm.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.103
- What kind of idiots
gonna keep working

33:24.136 --> 33:25.671
pistols in a roadhouse bar?

33:25.671 --> 33:27.373
- None of these work?

33:28.807 --> 33:31.177
- Did somebody say Pistol?

33:31.177 --> 33:33.011
- Mr. Love strikes again.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.347
Now what're we going to do?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.049
- Are you kidding me?

33:38.684 --> 33:42.054
- Shit happens, Sam, I'm
sorry about that, okay?

33:42.054 --> 33:44.323
Now the rest of you
idiots, outta here,

33:44.356 --> 33:45.991
the joke's over, go home.

33:45.991 --> 33:48.127
- We're being serious.

33:48.127 --> 33:50.296
(banging)

33:52.131 --> 33:53.332
- Somebody open it.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.533
- No, don't get
it, don't get it!

33:54.533 --> 33:56.335
ibo, do not get that door.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.636
- Who is it?

33:57.636 --> 33:59.138
- It's Virginia, Dani--
- It's Virginia, Dani?

33:59.138 --> 34:01.407
- And Horatio!
- And Horatio.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.641
- Horatio?

34:02.674 --> 34:04.810
Leave him out there.

34:04.810 --> 34:05.644
- What?

34:08.013 --> 34:09.047
Open the door.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.217
(yelling)

34:12.684 --> 34:14.320
- What the hell is
wrong with you people?

34:14.320 --> 34:16.322
- We got shot at.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.157
What the hell is happenin'?

34:18.157 --> 34:20.159
- They have got the
entire town blocked off.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.393
- I got it on my phone.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.095
- There were bodies
right in the middle

34:23.162 --> 34:24.163
of the street.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.165
- Oh Goddamn, oh shit!

34:26.198 --> 34:27.032
Fuck me.

34:29.668 --> 34:30.669
- Oh my God.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.373
I am calling my dad.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.243
- Can we have some guns?

34:37.243 --> 34:38.910
- How is it that no one
understands the guns

34:38.910 --> 34:40.045
are for decoration?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.247
- Pistol, we're pretty hungry.

34:41.247 --> 34:42.248
You got anything to eat?

34:42.248 --> 34:43.415
- Beer nuts, chips.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.250
- Sweet.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.617
- Sam, no more lies.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.886
- Pistol, this is not a joke.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.955
Something is
seriously wrong here.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.623
- What am I doing
here with you people?

34:51.690 --> 34:53.125
Pistol, take me home.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.460
- It's like two for one night
at the sizzler out there.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.695
We need guns like, pronto.

34:56.728 --> 34:57.796
- And ammo.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.231
- And beer.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.266
- Ammo.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.467
- [Both] Jerky.

35:01.533 --> 35:05.871
(speaks in foreign language)

35:05.871 --> 35:08.874
(speaks in foreign language)

35:08.907 --> 35:10.409
- Why exactly are we not sending

35:10.409 --> 35:13.111
in the military to
address this tragedy?

35:13.111 --> 35:15.113
- Look, if these people
want to kill themselves,

35:15.147 --> 35:16.782
let them go at it.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.318
Where I'm from, we call
that trimming the herd.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.320
- Trimming, trimming the herd!

35:21.320 --> 35:23.789
- Now this is a
perfect example of us

35:23.789 --> 35:26.292
not taking care of our citizens.

35:26.292 --> 35:27.326
- Citizens?

35:27.393 --> 35:28.227
Who said they were citizens?

35:28.227 --> 35:29.728
- No, no, no, no!

35:29.761 --> 35:31.763
- Who the hell are you to
judge who is an American?

35:31.797 --> 35:33.232
- They would not be
running wild in the street.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.901
- The people of the Southern
States are as American

35:35.901 --> 35:37.068
as the rest of us.

35:37.102 --> 35:38.970
If you were in this
room I would bitch-slap

35:38.970 --> 35:40.239
you right now.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.741
(intense music)
- Stay together.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.510
* It

35:44.510 --> 35:47.179
* Ain't real

35:47.179 --> 35:48.680
- Man, this sucks.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.652
I had plans.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.853
- What?

35:54.920 --> 35:58.790
- I was gonna finish
my associates degree.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.592
- Uh oh, look up here.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.763
Hey, hey, Sam, check it out.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.765
- Alright, get it.

36:06.798 --> 36:07.633
Nice!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.035
- Yeah, yeah!

36:12.671 --> 36:13.505
What?

36:14.540 --> 36:15.941
- You gotta hit him.

36:15.974 --> 36:16.842
- For real?

36:18.544 --> 36:20.979
- It's a zombie, hit it.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.548
- That ain't right.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.183
(yelling)

36:25.183 --> 36:26.017
- Get it!

36:28.320 --> 36:29.321
- Oh my God!

36:30.356 --> 36:31.790
- Holy shit!

36:31.790 --> 36:32.624
Yes!

36:37.663 --> 36:41.700
* I'm losing myself

36:41.700 --> 36:43.802
* I dunno when to brace myself

36:43.835 --> 36:46.505
* I dunno when to brace myself

36:46.505 --> 36:48.006
- Alright come on, let's go.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.975
- [Reporter] This just in:
the White House released

36:49.975 --> 36:52.344
drone footage of the
chaos in Corsicana.

36:52.378 --> 36:55.213
I warn you these
images are horrific.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.250
The rioters are attacking
innocent people in their cars.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.353
- The town is right next to
the Mexican border, no wall,

37:01.387 --> 37:04.556
they're coming in, these
damn illegal aliens

37:04.556 --> 37:05.757
take over the town.

37:05.824 --> 37:10.028
(speaks in foreign language)

37:10.061 --> 37:11.062
- Did you see the footage?

37:11.062 --> 37:12.264
What are you going to do?

37:12.331 --> 37:13.932
Tell me; what are
you going to do

37:13.932 --> 37:17.002
when they come in and they
beat down your door, hm?

37:17.035 --> 37:18.670
Oh I'm gonna give 'em a hug.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.439
No, I'll tell you what you want;

37:20.439 --> 37:23.575
you want to get
a gun, a big gun.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.412
That's right a gun, so that
you can protect your family

37:26.445 --> 37:30.181
before they steal your
dog and your daughter.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.709
- Alright, guys, go over there.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.716
(howling)

38:06.618 --> 38:09.120
- I love this fuckin' country!

38:11.657 --> 38:13.091
- Horatio get out of my frame.

38:13.124 --> 38:17.329
- No, no, no, no, see, I
am making my own movie.

38:17.329 --> 38:18.597
- Seriously, really dude?

38:18.630 --> 38:20.332
- Really, really,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:20.332 --> 38:23.502
I'm doing one about a
shitty filmmaker making

38:23.569 --> 38:26.738
a horror film and trying
to use real zombies

38:26.772 --> 38:30.108
to make his film,
that's what I'm doing.

38:31.477 --> 38:35.146
- You really think
someone would watch that?

38:44.255 --> 38:45.290
- Jojo!

38:45.323 --> 38:47.158
- Keep your voice down.

38:47.158 --> 38:47.993
- Beer!

38:50.496 --> 38:51.997
- Sh, don't, don't!

38:51.997 --> 38:52.831
- Yes.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.268
- Don't move.

38:59.938 --> 39:00.672
- Yes.

39:01.507 --> 39:02.340
- Don't!

39:03.642 --> 39:05.477
(laughing)

39:05.477 --> 39:08.146
(intense music)

39:11.717 --> 39:14.886
(gun firing)
- Get out of here.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.388
- Fucking A!

39:16.455 --> 39:20.325
- Weapons work better
with ammunition.

39:20.358 --> 39:23.128
* It's making me sad now

39:23.128 --> 39:28.133
* A little sad, yeah, yeah

39:28.900 --> 39:31.336
* Gets me, memory

39:31.369 --> 39:32.671
- What's going on?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.139
- Seems like everyone
thinks the bar

39:34.139 --> 39:36.475
is the best place to be
when all hell breaks loose.

39:36.475 --> 39:37.809
- We're gonna be lucky
if we even make it out

39:37.843 --> 39:39.077
of this town alive.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.245
- Jojo, you gotta
stop looking at me

39:40.245 --> 39:41.513
while I'm taking a piss.

39:41.547 --> 39:43.381
- I, I'm not, what
are you talking about?

39:43.381 --> 39:44.850
- And it doesn't matter anyway,

39:44.850 --> 39:46.518
wasn't that always the
case, I mean come on, man.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.520
How come my movies
never go anywhere?

39:48.520 --> 39:50.689
- Because they suck?

39:50.722 --> 39:53.559
Except for your hair,
and your acting.

39:53.559 --> 39:56.061
- Tibo my movies do not suck.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.596
I don't have
production value, man.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.665
I've never had production value.

39:59.698 --> 40:02.033
- So you're going to
film us while we get

40:02.067 --> 40:04.169
attacked by zombies.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.003
- No.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.507
(farting)

40:08.507 --> 40:09.708
I have an idea.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.079
(crowd applauds)

40:14.079 --> 40:16.347
- Alright, y'all, we're
gonna take a break,

40:16.381 --> 40:18.717
we'll be back in just a few.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.128
- Hello, hey, Popper here,

40:31.429 --> 40:33.198
I've probably changed your oil,

40:33.231 --> 40:36.067
I know I've changed your oil.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.269
Or fixed something on your car

40:38.269 --> 40:39.605
or your bicycles.

40:40.872 --> 40:44.643
Hey, there's one man
here tonight who saw

40:44.643 --> 40:47.979
the shit comin' before anybody.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.749
Like, like Nostradamus
or something.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.585
He said the shit was
gonna hit the fan,

40:53.585 --> 40:57.422
the zombies, the undead,
and said zombie apocalypse,

40:57.422 --> 41:00.892
before anybody else
knew what was happening.

41:00.892 --> 41:04.329
He's my main man, my
best friend, Sammy P.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.735
- Oh for fuck's sake!

41:09.735 --> 41:13.805
His movie didn't even make
it into the damn festival!

41:13.805 --> 41:15.907
- Yeah, no shit, dumbass.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.610
And we all know that now.

41:18.644 --> 41:20.979
But it's okay, you know why?

41:22.648 --> 41:23.849
Hit 'em, Jojo.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.817
- Sam has an idea.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.485
- That's right, Jojo.

41:27.519 --> 41:29.788
Ladies and gentleman,
our zombie maestro

41:29.821 --> 41:30.989
of ceremonies, Sammy P!

41:30.989 --> 41:33.491
(crowd claps)

41:35.827 --> 41:38.997
- Thank you, Popper.
- You're welcome.

41:40.632 --> 41:43.802
- Well, um, so I've
been thinking, um,

41:48.506 --> 41:49.808
we're in crisis.

41:51.176 --> 41:54.680
The world out there
is upside down;

41:54.680 --> 41:56.548
brother eating brother.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.219
And you know, we can sit
here and we can drink

42:01.286 --> 42:04.189
and party 'till
the bitter end, or,

42:06.558 --> 42:09.728
we could unite for
a common cause.

42:09.728 --> 42:13.364
We can show the world
that we are one people,

42:13.364 --> 42:18.036
that we are survivors, that
we can beat unbeatable odds!

42:19.805 --> 42:22.207
And how do we show the world?

42:23.374 --> 42:25.711
I will document it!

42:25.744 --> 42:29.414
This town, yeah it
might be dried up,

42:29.414 --> 42:31.082
we're sitting on
an oilfield here,

42:31.082 --> 42:32.818
this is our goldmine!

42:33.985 --> 42:36.221
We can make a movie as one,

42:37.188 --> 42:38.857
and we will triumph!

42:43.662 --> 42:45.997
- Okay, so what's the movie?

42:47.398 --> 42:48.867
- Have you ever heard
the phrase found footage?

42:48.867 --> 42:52.203
- Have you heard the term
DOA, dead on arrival.

42:52.203 --> 42:53.438
Have you?

42:53.438 --> 42:55.674
You jackasses, go make
your homemade movie,

42:55.707 --> 42:57.943
I'm gonna sit right
here and drink my beer.

42:57.943 --> 42:59.778
- Come on, Bird Dog.

42:59.845 --> 43:02.681
We finally have a chance to
make something of ourselves.

43:02.681 --> 43:03.782
- Oh shut up!

43:03.782 --> 43:04.850
You're drunk!

43:05.917 --> 43:09.354
(crowd booing)
- Come on.

43:13.391 --> 43:15.426
- Hey, get off the stage!

43:20.065 --> 43:23.268
(intense rock music)

43:23.268 --> 43:25.470
- Listen, listen, big Jim.

43:25.536 --> 43:29.374
There are many, many,
many bonuses to the film

43:30.608 --> 43:32.477
and entertainment industry.

43:32.543 --> 43:33.544
- Like what?

43:33.544 --> 43:35.113
- Number one, poontang.

43:35.113 --> 43:38.116
Number two De Niro,
or money as we call it

43:38.149 --> 43:40.151
in the States.
- Sure.

43:40.218 --> 43:42.053
- So, pussy and money.

43:43.288 --> 43:45.390
So think about it, think
about it like this okay,

43:45.423 --> 43:48.960
like, you ever like
work really hard to get

43:48.960 --> 43:51.229
into a chick's pants,
like you really want it,

43:51.262 --> 43:54.733
and you spend a lot
of money and time,

43:54.733 --> 43:56.267
you're not going to
get any of that money

43:56.301 --> 43:58.804
or time back, but you
get the experience,

43:58.804 --> 44:01.406
even if she's not very good
you get the experience.

44:01.439 --> 44:05.143
Look, man, look, you are
getting in on the ground

44:05.143 --> 44:07.979
level of so much
production value.

44:09.614 --> 44:14.519
You never get this; real fucking
zombies here in Corsicana.

44:16.021 --> 44:20.458
So, but if you are in
now you first money out.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.160
- I can't leave here, though.

44:22.160 --> 44:24.329
- You can't leave, you
don't have to leave here!

44:24.329 --> 44:25.496
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

44:25.530 --> 44:26.832
- You don't know what
I'm talking about?

44:26.832 --> 44:27.833
- No I don't.
- Do you like pussy?

44:27.866 --> 44:29.300
- Yes.
- Do you like money?

44:29.334 --> 44:30.501
- Yes.
- Then you're in.

44:30.501 --> 44:33.271
(crowd applauds)

44:39.010 --> 44:43.281
* Oh when I dreamed that
you called my name *

44:43.314 --> 44:47.218
* Oh when I dreamed that
you called my name *

44:47.218 --> 44:48.153
- Oh, shit.

44:53.859 --> 44:54.860
Who is that?

44:58.864 --> 45:02.633
Hey let me get out of here
before you wreck this place.

45:02.633 --> 45:03.468
Oh, dude!

45:04.736 --> 45:07.038
You're gonna wake up
the dead with that!

45:07.038 --> 45:08.573
Quit fuckin' around, Pistol.

45:08.639 --> 45:10.141
(yelling)

45:10.175 --> 45:12.978
* Hear bells and
who's to blame *

45:12.978 --> 45:15.246
(yelling)

45:15.246 --> 45:16.882
* Are calling my name

45:16.882 --> 45:17.816
- Pistol!

45:17.849 --> 45:19.350
Pistol, you've got to see this!

45:19.384 --> 45:20.218
Pistol!

45:21.386 --> 45:23.154
- Oh my God, get off
my man, you slut!

45:23.154 --> 45:24.355
- Shut your pie hole, bitch.

45:24.389 --> 45:25.891
- Oh he got me!

45:25.891 --> 45:27.225
He got me!

45:27.225 --> 45:30.028
(yelling)

45:30.061 --> 45:30.896
- Run!

45:32.998 --> 45:34.900
- Get out of my way!

45:34.900 --> 45:36.401
Get out of my way!

45:37.903 --> 45:39.037
- Oh my God, he neutered him!

45:39.070 --> 45:41.072
- I think I wet myself,
I pissed myself.

45:41.072 --> 45:42.740
- Go, go, go, go, go!

45:42.740 --> 45:43.574
- Where are we going?

45:43.574 --> 45:44.509
Where are we going?

45:44.542 --> 45:45.210
- We're going to Pam's school!

45:45.243 --> 45:46.177
- Why?

45:46.177 --> 45:46.945
- Because the windows have bars!

45:46.945 --> 45:47.779
- Go, go!

45:47.779 --> 45:49.714
Just get in your truck!

45:54.285 --> 45:57.088
- Hey kids, there's a
new sheriff in town.

45:57.088 --> 45:59.424
All your worries will
wash away with one bite

45:59.424 --> 46:00.859
of these delicious chocolatey,

46:00.892 --> 46:03.394
cream filled Freedom Cakes.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.896
Your parents keeping you down?

46:04.896 --> 46:07.698
Do they keep making you eat
food not fit to feed an ostrich?

46:07.698 --> 46:08.867
Blech!

46:08.900 --> 46:11.803
Don't worry, Freedom
Cakes are here!

46:11.803 --> 46:13.404
This is America,
where we get to eat

46:13.438 --> 46:17.275
what we want, it's
your God given right!

46:17.275 --> 46:20.478
Coming to a store
near you on July 4th.

46:25.250 --> 46:26.217
- Hey, guys.

46:26.217 --> 46:27.418
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:27.452 --> 46:30.455
- Really like your
handiwork back there.

46:30.455 --> 46:32.657
You guys have any film
production experience?

46:32.723 --> 46:36.727
- No, boss, but as you
can see we're productive.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.397
- Yeah, yeah you are.

46:40.598 --> 46:42.000
Better that way
anyway, film production

46:42.000 --> 46:44.469
experience will make you jaded.

46:44.469 --> 46:46.972
You guys want to make a movie?

46:50.141 --> 46:51.776
- Why the hell are we here?

46:51.809 --> 46:55.446
- Ladies and gentleman,
this is our destiny.

46:55.446 --> 46:58.416
We have a movie
lot, right there.

46:58.416 --> 47:00.651
We have hair, we have make up,

47:00.651 --> 47:02.620
we have set--
- Ahmm.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.155
- Yes?

47:04.155 --> 47:07.825
- Um, are you suggesting
that we use real zombies?

47:10.628 --> 47:12.363
- Real, real zombies.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.035
Yes.

47:17.035 --> 47:20.872
We are going to make the
first ever zombie film

47:22.340 --> 47:24.642
using real zombies.

47:24.675 --> 47:25.510
- What?

47:27.345 --> 47:30.515
- Sam, you know I'll do
anything for a movie,

47:30.548 --> 47:33.384
kind of known for being
a team player, but uh,

47:33.451 --> 47:35.353
isn't this a little dangerous?

47:35.353 --> 47:36.354
- Yes.

47:36.354 --> 47:37.355
Yeah, right?

47:39.157 --> 47:41.359
Working with zombies
could be misconstrued

47:41.359 --> 47:42.527
as not a good idea.

47:42.527 --> 47:44.129
- Fair enough.

47:44.162 --> 47:46.831
- We're not going to
use dangerous ones.

47:46.831 --> 47:50.035
- What kind of zombies
are you planning on using?

47:50.035 --> 47:51.236
- Safe ones.

47:51.302 --> 47:52.137
Safer.

47:52.170 --> 47:53.338
- Safe zombies.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.206
- The only safe zombie
is a dead zombie.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.642
- Got that straight, son.

47:57.642 --> 47:59.210
- [Both] Hah!

47:59.210 --> 48:01.146
- The name of our movie.

48:02.180 --> 48:03.481
You guys ready?

48:03.481 --> 48:04.315
- Yes.

48:04.315 --> 48:05.216
- Yeah, yeah.

48:05.216 --> 48:05.917
- Come on, are you guys ready?

48:05.984 --> 48:06.817
- Yeah!

48:06.817 --> 48:07.652
- Yes!

48:07.652 --> 48:09.154
Alright!

48:09.154 --> 48:09.921
Fat

48:11.489 --> 48:12.323
Ass

48:13.558 --> 48:14.359
Zombies!

48:17.195 --> 48:18.729
Fat Ass Zombies.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.665
- Wilson, come on,
that's even worse

48:20.698 --> 48:23.201
than Deadbeat Zombie Dad.

48:23.201 --> 48:26.704
- It's amazing, and it's
perfect for the film

48:26.704 --> 48:29.174
that we are going to make.

48:29.174 --> 48:32.543
- Fat Ass Zombies,
I love it, bro!

48:32.577 --> 48:35.380
- Alright, so we're
in school, right?

48:35.380 --> 48:36.581
How about a quiz?

48:36.581 --> 48:37.882
- Oh, oh, me, pick me!
- You guys want a quiz?

48:37.915 --> 48:39.417
Come on, come on,
alright here we go.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.919
What does this town
not have a shortage of?

48:41.919 --> 48:43.088
- Ooh oh oh!

48:43.088 --> 48:44.122
- Who's got it?

48:44.122 --> 48:46.124
Alright, Wilson!

48:46.124 --> 48:47.892
- [Together] Zombies!

48:49.694 --> 48:51.896
- You're right,
head of the class.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.264
Before the zombies.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.265
- Ooh oh oh!

48:55.266 --> 48:56.101
- Popper!

48:56.101 --> 48:57.268
- Stupid people!

48:57.302 --> 49:00.471
- Also true, yup,
lot of stupid people.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.442
- I think I had third grade
English in this class.

49:04.442 --> 49:06.044
I'll always remember
because this was the site

49:06.077 --> 49:07.378
of my first erection.

49:07.378 --> 49:09.114
- What else?
- Oh!

49:09.114 --> 49:10.415
I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it!

49:10.448 --> 49:11.449
- Give it one more shot.

49:11.449 --> 49:13.951
- Stupid people with no jobs!

49:13.951 --> 49:15.620
- Okay, that's true.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.322
We're kind of staying on that.

49:17.388 --> 49:18.556
Think bigger guys, think bigger.

49:18.589 --> 49:19.790
- Sam!

49:19.790 --> 49:21.492
- Stupid people with
no jobs and no money!

49:21.559 --> 49:22.427
- Fat people!

49:22.460 --> 49:23.294
- Woah!

49:23.294 --> 49:24.129
- Fatties!

49:25.296 --> 49:27.832
Big ol' fat, fat,
fat, fatties, guys!

49:27.832 --> 49:29.067
- Damn straight!
- We have five

49:29.100 --> 49:31.769
Chinese buffts for a
town of 20,000 people.

49:31.769 --> 49:33.071
That's is a lot of tub.

49:33.071 --> 49:36.307
All of your parents
are very, very fat.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.143
And that, ladies and gentleman,

49:38.176 --> 49:40.845
is what we are going to use.

49:40.845 --> 49:42.347
The fat, the slow.

49:44.515 --> 49:47.185
What is the name of our movie?

49:47.252 --> 49:48.986
- [Together] Fat Ass Zombies!

49:48.986 --> 49:49.820
- Yes!

49:49.820 --> 49:50.755
Come on!

49:50.788 --> 49:52.690
- [Together] Fat Ass Zombies!

49:52.690 --> 49:54.592
Fat Ass Zombies!

49:54.625 --> 49:56.794
Fat Ass Zombies!

49:56.794 --> 49:58.696
Fat Ass Zombies!

49:58.696 --> 50:00.531
Fat Ass Zombies!

50:00.598 --> 50:02.700
Fat Ass Zombies!

50:02.700 --> 50:04.135
Fat Ass Zombies!

50:06.204 --> 50:07.038
- Magic!

50:08.039 --> 50:10.641
(upbeat music)

50:53.518 --> 50:54.985
- Blue team!

50:54.985 --> 50:57.488
You guys are operation
Capture Fat and Safe Zombies.

50:57.488 --> 50:58.923
Remember, anything fat, slow,

50:58.923 --> 51:00.725
doesn't move fast and
it's easy to kill.

51:00.725 --> 51:03.761
Yellow team, you guys
are weapons and gear.

51:03.828 --> 51:07.031
Somehow nobody thought to grab
it when we left Pete's place.

51:07.064 --> 51:10.435
So, get us weapons,
hatchets, shovels, bats,

51:10.435 --> 51:12.002
chainsaws, ladles, I don't care,

51:12.036 --> 51:13.404
anything is better
than what we have,

51:13.404 --> 51:15.706
just remember it's
lame to shoot zombies.

51:15.740 --> 51:18.576
Get us something fun
to kill zombies with.

51:18.576 --> 51:20.445
(grunting)

51:20.445 --> 51:22.447
Red team, you guys are
operation Munchies;

51:22.513 --> 51:24.615
we need food and drink!

51:24.615 --> 51:28.786
The school shut down the
lunch program, right, Pam?

51:28.786 --> 51:31.256
Ugh, where do our taxes go?

51:31.256 --> 51:32.723
Get us food, guys.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.959
Green team, you guys are
with me here at basecamp

51:34.959 --> 51:36.461
starting preproduction.

51:36.461 --> 51:37.962
Let's make movie

51:40.698 --> 51:41.966
Let's move!

51:41.966 --> 51:43.801
- Si, maestro!
- Come on!

51:43.801 --> 51:45.203
(speaks in foreign language)

51:45.236 --> 51:47.705
(bright music)

51:47.705 --> 51:49.874
* Chest

51:49.874 --> 51:53.611
* Nuts

51:53.611 --> 51:56.281
* Feed it to him

52:11.596 --> 52:12.930
- Put craft here
right on that table,

52:12.930 --> 52:14.165
and get all the weapons out

52:14.165 --> 52:15.733
and on those shelves, alright?

52:15.766 --> 52:16.601
- Okay.

52:27.745 --> 52:30.915
- Oh I am getting
the ice cream, bros!

52:32.483 --> 52:36.487
- Okay, okay, uh, might
I suggest getting items

52:36.521 --> 52:37.788
with more sustenance.

52:37.822 --> 52:38.956
- Nope!

52:38.956 --> 52:41.025
- God, this is so stupid.

52:45.830 --> 52:47.998
(yelling)

52:52.803 --> 52:55.440
Oh, I love berries, I really do.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.142
Oh Jesus Christ, ah!

53:00.010 --> 53:01.279
Oh my God!

53:01.279 --> 53:02.680
Okay, time to go!

53:04.449 --> 53:05.350
Time to go!

53:12.357 --> 53:15.693
- Drive, drive, drive,
come on, come on!

53:16.694 --> 53:17.962
- It's a child.

53:19.063 --> 53:20.231
- What?

53:20.298 --> 53:22.367
- Who brought the baby?

53:22.367 --> 53:23.468
- Baby?

53:23.501 --> 53:24.502
- Oh dear God!
- What?

53:24.535 --> 53:25.370
What?

53:25.370 --> 53:26.571
(yelling)

53:26.571 --> 53:28.373
- What do I do, what
do I do, what do I do?

53:28.373 --> 53:30.074
- Um, get rid of
it, get rid of it!

53:30.140 --> 53:31.742
- Okay, okay, okay!

53:31.742 --> 53:34.245
(baby cooing)

53:36.714 --> 53:40.050
- Don't look back
guys, don't look back.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.090
- Sam?

53:46.156 --> 53:47.091
- Hey!
- Sam, God!

53:47.091 --> 53:48.326
There you are.
- Fresh markers!

53:48.359 --> 53:50.595
Pam, this is amazing,
the ideas are flying out

53:50.595 --> 53:51.862
of my head, this is it!

53:51.896 --> 53:53.864
- I'm so excited for you!

53:53.864 --> 53:54.765
- I know, right?

53:54.765 --> 53:56.267
- Okay wait, I've been thinking,

53:56.334 --> 53:57.602
I don't want anyone to get hurt

53:57.602 --> 53:58.903
and we don't know what's
going on out there so--

53:58.903 --> 54:00.204
- Pam, I know what's
going on out there.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.439
This town's been
one heatwave away

54:01.439 --> 54:02.840
from destroying
itself for years.

54:02.873 --> 54:05.843
- Yeah, yeah, I
know, it's just...

54:05.843 --> 54:08.746
I just wanna make sure no
one's gonna get hurt, you know?

54:08.746 --> 54:10.247
- We're gonna sneak around,

54:10.281 --> 54:13.851
we're gonna watch chompers
chasing people, that's it!

54:13.884 --> 54:14.719
- Okay.

54:17.221 --> 54:19.890
- I wonder if the
sheriff's turned.

54:19.890 --> 54:21.526
I gotta go.

54:21.526 --> 54:22.427
I gotta go!

54:30.301 --> 54:33.404
So, you tell me
we've got no weapons,

54:34.439 --> 54:36.807
a very meager craft services,

54:40.311 --> 54:42.980
and for a zombie, you
got me a fifth grader

54:42.980 --> 54:44.315
in a retainer.

54:44.315 --> 54:46.317
(yelling)

54:46.317 --> 54:47.885
- We're making a movie!

54:47.918 --> 54:50.621
Let's review the following;

54:50.621 --> 54:53.724
I'm not gonna change the
way I look or the way

54:53.758 --> 54:56.260
I feel to conform to anything,

54:57.261 --> 54:59.330
I've always been a freak.

55:00.465 --> 55:02.933
Okay, yeah, I've
never liked it either.

55:02.933 --> 55:04.134
Okay, moving on.

55:04.134 --> 55:07.838
Another one from another
John, a real 'Merican,

55:07.905 --> 55:12.577
courage is being scared to
death but saddling up anyway.

55:14.011 --> 55:17.348
And finally, screw
it, let's do it, yes!

55:18.816 --> 55:21.352
Sir Richard Branson, yes!

55:21.419 --> 55:23.354
- Are you freakin' kidding me?

55:23.354 --> 55:24.855
This is what you've been doing

55:24.855 --> 55:26.023
while we've been out there
risking our necks, huh?

55:26.090 --> 55:27.925
- Yeah, it's what
I've been doing, and,

55:27.925 --> 55:30.761
you know, getting art department
and a script together.

55:30.795 --> 55:32.530
You can't have a movie
without a script.

55:32.530 --> 55:34.198
- Yeah, and we can't
live without food, huh.

55:34.264 --> 55:35.500
I should have been
on the red team.

55:35.500 --> 55:36.967
- Hey, man!

55:37.001 --> 55:40.638
We have like, enough gummy
bears to last a month!

55:42.507 --> 55:43.374
Jeez, here!

55:45.175 --> 55:47.945
- I'm not worried
about the food,

55:47.978 --> 55:50.681
I'm worried about
being their food.

55:50.681 --> 55:51.882
They're fast.

55:51.949 --> 55:53.150
- Anything's faster
than you, brother,

55:53.183 --> 55:56.387
the way you keep
smoking that shit.

55:56.387 --> 55:57.888
- Don't hate, man!

55:58.889 --> 56:00.491
- Woah, woah, guys!

56:00.525 --> 56:01.992
- Okay, okay, okay!

56:01.992 --> 56:03.994
- Woah, guys, seriously!

56:04.028 --> 56:05.530
Come on, guys!

56:05.530 --> 56:09.133
- Mr. Pentergass, report
to the principal's office,

56:09.133 --> 56:11.536
once you stop dicking around.

56:22.312 --> 56:23.848
So, Mr. Pentergass,

56:27.918 --> 56:30.521
what do you have to
say for yourself?

56:30.555 --> 56:33.157
- I'm sorry sir, I didn't
think using the school

56:33.157 --> 56:34.892
would be a big deal,
it's been abandoned,

56:34.892 --> 56:37.394
- Mr. Pentergass,
I've heard it once,

56:37.394 --> 56:39.830
I've heard it a thousand times.

56:39.864 --> 56:40.698
Spare me.

56:42.099 --> 56:45.603
Pentergass, this calls
for greater action.

56:46.837 --> 56:48.839
This calls for something
way more sizable

56:48.839 --> 56:50.040
in my response.

56:52.109 --> 56:54.211
This calls for Priscilla.

56:55.279 --> 56:56.581
'Scuse me, sir?

56:56.581 --> 56:57.582
- Priscilla!

57:00.585 --> 57:02.553
Meet Priscilla, Mr. Pentergass!

57:02.553 --> 57:04.088
- Mr. Johnson you
have a big gun, sir,

57:04.088 --> 57:06.691
- Shall we make a zombie film?

57:06.724 --> 57:08.926
(laughing)

57:18.068 --> 57:20.304
(grunting)

57:24.975 --> 57:25.910
- Hit me here.

57:25.943 --> 57:28.212
Yo, hit me here, hit me here.

57:28.212 --> 57:29.279
- Hey!

57:29.279 --> 57:30.114
Listen up!

57:31.315 --> 57:34.218
- Thank you, Pam.
- You're welcome.

57:37.421 --> 57:40.658
- Alright, this is
where it all begins.

57:42.259 --> 57:46.931
This is where they discover
something's not quite right.

57:46.931 --> 57:51.769
They see some folks on the
side of the road, they're hurt,

57:53.437 --> 57:54.438
or are they?

57:57.608 --> 57:59.744
Let's make a movie!
- Yeah!

57:59.744 --> 58:01.411
- Let's make a movie!

58:02.980 --> 58:05.315
- Jose, Eldad, crafty.

58:05.315 --> 58:08.653
(speaks in foreign language)

58:08.653 --> 58:09.654
- Hey, now which direction

58:09.654 --> 58:10.855
are we shooting in again?

58:10.921 --> 58:12.156
- We're gonna shoot all
the way down the road,

58:12.156 --> 58:13.357
so make sure it's
clear down there.

58:13.423 --> 58:17.127
- Alright, you got it,
partner, let's do this!

58:18.963 --> 58:21.098
- Next, maestro?

58:21.098 --> 58:24.802
(speaks in foreign language)

58:24.835 --> 58:26.036
- Quiet on set!

58:27.838 --> 58:29.006
- Sound speed.
- Speed.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.641
- Roll camera.

58:30.675 --> 58:31.876
- Rolling, rolling.

58:31.876 --> 58:33.678
- You guys ready for awesome?

58:33.678 --> 58:34.511
- Yeah.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.715
- Release the zombies!

58:38.949 --> 58:40.050
- Go, go, go!

58:40.050 --> 58:42.452
- Ey, ey, c'mon, zombies, go!

58:43.688 --> 58:45.522
- Go, go, go, zombies, go!

58:45.556 --> 58:46.490
- C'mon!

58:46.523 --> 58:48.693
(speaks in foreign language)

58:48.693 --> 58:50.861
Come on you little shit, go!

58:50.861 --> 58:51.729
Go, go, go!

58:52.863 --> 58:55.499
- Come on zombies, go!
- Pistol?

58:55.499 --> 58:57.167
Release the zombies!

58:58.135 --> 58:59.804
- They won't go!

58:59.837 --> 59:01.672
- Pistol, they ain't
like cattle or horses,

59:01.706 --> 59:03.373
I don't know how to do this!

59:03.373 --> 59:05.710
- Just get back there
and give 'em a hand!

59:05.710 --> 59:07.077
- Sam, I'm trying!

59:07.077 --> 59:08.378
You wanna come do this?

59:08.378 --> 59:10.915
- Dani, hit them in the ribcage!

59:10.981 --> 59:12.182
- Alright, I'm tryin'!

59:12.216 --> 59:13.751
- C'mon, blood,
blood over there!

59:13.751 --> 59:14.985
Blood!

59:15.019 --> 59:15.720
- Alright you guys,
brace yourselves,

59:15.720 --> 59:16.854
here we go.

59:16.887 --> 59:18.355
- Zombies el prontos, pronto!

59:18.355 --> 59:20.758
- Go get that
blonde girl, c'mon!

59:20.758 --> 59:23.493
(dramatic music)

59:29.266 --> 59:31.335
- What the fuck was that?

59:32.670 --> 59:33.704
- Oh, shit.

59:33.738 --> 59:35.405
- C'mon, zombies, go!

59:35.405 --> 59:37.775
Go for that blonde girl!

59:37.775 --> 59:39.176
- She's handicap.

59:40.210 --> 59:41.078
- She okay?

59:42.579 --> 59:45.415
- Course she's not okay,
she's a damn zombie!

59:45.415 --> 59:46.951
- No I know, but is
she gonna get back

59:47.017 --> 59:48.518
in the wheelchair?

59:48.552 --> 59:49.754
- She ain't going anywhere,

59:49.754 --> 59:51.255
she's crippled, Sam.

59:51.255 --> 59:52.790
- Already down a
zombie and we haven't

59:52.857 --> 59:55.225
even got the first
shot off, bro!

59:55.259 --> 59:56.093
- Dammit.

59:57.561 --> 1:00:01.565
Dani, I said slow zombies
not completely paralyzed!

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:05.970
- I know, I guess we just
got all the defective ones!

1:00:09.239 --> 1:00:11.108
- Okay, they're out!

1:00:11.108 --> 1:00:12.209
Quiet on set.

1:00:13.210 --> 1:00:14.544
Action!

1:00:14.544 --> 1:00:16.714
(yelling)

1:00:22.319 --> 1:00:23.153
- Yeah?

1:00:23.153 --> 1:00:23.988
Yeah?

1:00:25.155 --> 1:00:26.090
- Let's tone it down a bit.

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:28.092
Just a smidgen, sweetheart.

1:00:28.092 --> 1:00:29.760
Yeah, you're going
to scare the zombies.

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:30.761
- Come on, guys!

1:00:30.761 --> 1:00:32.262
Just start running, let's go!

1:00:32.262 --> 1:00:34.264
- Hey, let's just shoot some
tights and fix it in post.

1:00:34.264 --> 1:00:35.465
- We're not gonna fix
shit in post, Popper,

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:36.901
you just gotta get the shot.

1:00:36.934 --> 1:00:37.768
- Okay.

1:00:37.768 --> 1:00:39.970
- Tiffany, look scared!

1:00:39.970 --> 1:00:42.506
- She's too hot to look scared.

1:00:44.474 --> 1:00:45.976
- Come on, guys,
just start running!

1:00:45.976 --> 1:00:48.846
- Okay, now when you're
running, really exaggerate.

1:00:48.846 --> 1:00:50.614
- Alright look, you're scared,

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:53.017
the zombies are coming, they're
gonna rip your face off!

1:00:53.017 --> 1:00:55.252
You gotta run to the car, c'mon!

1:00:55.285 --> 1:00:57.021
- You look stupid!

1:00:57.021 --> 1:00:58.522
- Tiffany, stay in
character, c'mon.

1:00:58.588 --> 1:01:01.125
- Whatever happened
to less is more, huh?

1:01:01.158 --> 1:01:02.960
- Okay, let's go.

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:05.195
C'mon, c'mon, woman!
- I don't want to!

1:01:05.195 --> 1:01:07.364
(yelling)

1:01:08.532 --> 1:01:09.366
Go, go!

1:01:10.334 --> 1:01:11.168
- I'm trying!

1:01:11.168 --> 1:01:12.002
- Go, go!

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:17.007
- Cut!

1:01:17.007 --> 1:01:17.975
Beautiful!

1:01:18.008 --> 1:01:19.176
Yeah, alright!

1:01:20.444 --> 1:01:21.545
Very good.

1:01:21.545 --> 1:01:23.113
- Hey, Sam, man.

1:01:23.147 --> 1:01:26.283
What's the plan on
getting them back in?

1:01:26.283 --> 1:01:27.818
- Oh, shit.

1:01:27.852 --> 1:01:29.186
Uh, that's a good question.

1:01:29.186 --> 1:01:30.387
- Oh...

1:01:30.387 --> 1:01:31.555
Alright, time to go,
people, let's go!

1:01:31.621 --> 1:01:33.290
- I should get some of this!

1:01:33.290 --> 1:01:34.191
- Move, move!

1:01:34.191 --> 1:01:35.125
- Move, move, move, move!

1:01:35.159 --> 1:01:36.360
- Pistol, get the zombies!

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:38.996
- I'm gettin' this,
I'm gettin' this!

1:01:39.029 --> 1:01:40.664
- How are we with these idiots?

1:01:40.664 --> 1:01:42.166
- This is crazy.

1:01:42.199 --> 1:01:43.467
- Carl, Carl, come on!

1:01:43.467 --> 1:01:46.303
Dude, what's wrong
with your eyes?

1:01:48.205 --> 1:01:50.174
- You're fucked up, man.

1:01:52.576 --> 1:01:55.813
You went too far,
now you're gonna pay.

1:01:57.047 --> 1:01:58.816
- [Reporter] This
is a special report.

1:01:58.816 --> 1:02:00.217
Why, America, why?

1:02:01.485 --> 1:02:03.187
Our investigative
team is on the hunt

1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:07.324
for the cause of the
chaos in Corsicana.

1:02:07.324 --> 1:02:09.994
- I frequently,
we, support a lot

1:02:10.027 --> 1:02:11.595
of charitable organizations.

1:02:11.595 --> 1:02:14.698
Locally and nationally,
internationally.

1:02:14.731 --> 1:02:18.568
- So me and my son and my
grandson, Bubba and Bubba Jr.,

1:02:18.568 --> 1:02:20.938
we drink a 30-pack together.

1:02:21.005 --> 1:02:22.840
And that night I
have this idea; hey,

1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:26.243
what if we got liberals
to send us money?

1:02:27.778 --> 1:02:30.280
- It's the Worldwide
Redneck Fund,

1:02:30.347 --> 1:02:34.351
and it allows people like
us to adopt a redneck.

1:02:36.586 --> 1:02:39.924
- You know, it's like adopt
a kid over there in Africa,

1:02:39.924 --> 1:02:41.025
you know, them
little black kids,

1:02:41.025 --> 1:02:42.726
you can feed one for 10 cents.

1:02:42.759 --> 1:02:45.062
- Occasionally he
would ask for cash.

1:02:45.062 --> 1:02:47.031
- You know, we got certain
rights, and that's a right

1:02:47.031 --> 1:02:49.900
to worship God, a right
to carry my gun...

1:02:49.934 --> 1:02:51.768
- And I thought we
were making progress.

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:53.603
He said to me once,
I'm considering

1:02:53.637 --> 1:02:56.974
about going gluten
free for a week.

1:02:56.974 --> 1:02:59.910
- And I don't know what the
other ones are, the other ones

1:02:59.944 --> 1:03:00.878
don't even matter.

1:03:00.878 --> 1:03:02.079
- The latest gun that he bought,

1:03:02.112 --> 1:03:03.147
he didn't name it.

1:03:03.147 --> 1:03:04.148
- Oh, Ethyl?

1:03:04.148 --> 1:03:06.083
This is my AR10.

1:03:06.116 --> 1:03:08.785
- What's happening in Texas
is certainly distressing

1:03:08.785 --> 1:03:10.720
and we're all concerned.

1:03:10.754 --> 1:03:12.489
- We got a silencer
or suppressor on it.

1:03:12.489 --> 1:03:16.160
- What I think my wife
is trying to say is--

1:03:17.627 --> 1:03:20.464
- Please don't tell me what
I'm trying to say, thank you,

1:03:20.464 --> 1:03:22.632
I know what I'm trying to say.

1:03:22.632 --> 1:03:25.235
- The more money we have
the more bullets we can get.

1:03:25.269 --> 1:03:28.272
- I sent 400
recycling containers.

1:03:28.305 --> 1:03:29.573
- The more stuff we can shoot.

1:03:29.573 --> 1:03:32.943
- You sent four hundred
recycling bins to Bubba?

1:03:32.977 --> 1:03:35.445
- There's a lot of things
wrong with this country.

1:03:35.445 --> 1:03:37.581
- I thought Bubba was
a place in Ethiopia.

1:03:37.581 --> 1:03:39.316
- There ain't no
daddies anymore.

1:03:39.316 --> 1:03:41.818
- Do they even recycle in Texas?

1:03:41.852 --> 1:03:42.953
- Killed a lot of hogs.

1:03:42.987 --> 1:03:44.354
- I sent him kombucha.

1:03:44.354 --> 1:03:45.990
- Money started pourin' in, man.

1:03:45.990 --> 1:03:47.992
- The poems of Maya Angelou.

1:03:48.025 --> 1:03:49.626
- Let freedom ring!

1:03:51.095 --> 1:03:54.264
- You know I could use a
little kombucha right now.

1:03:54.298 --> 1:03:56.133
- Okay, guys, I
know we're tired,

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:57.501
I know it took us a
while to get here,

1:03:57.501 --> 1:03:59.136
I know we're down to our
last two bags of chips,

1:03:59.136 --> 1:04:02.039
but listen, we got
great stuff back there,

1:04:02.039 --> 1:04:04.774
and yeah, we had to
strike fast and we left

1:04:04.808 --> 1:04:07.111
some stuff behind, and
Carl's probably dead,

1:04:07.111 --> 1:04:11.181
but what is the classic
location for a zombie movie?

1:04:11.181 --> 1:04:12.316
- Corsicana, Texas.

1:04:12.349 --> 1:04:13.550
- Yes, more local though.

1:04:13.550 --> 1:04:15.385
- Cemetery?
- No.

1:04:15.385 --> 1:04:16.887
- Hospital.
- No.

1:04:16.954 --> 1:04:17.854
- Black hole?

1:04:17.854 --> 1:04:19.189
- Okay, that's above our budget.

1:04:19.189 --> 1:04:20.190
- Oh!

1:04:20.190 --> 1:04:21.625
Ninja dojo!

1:04:21.658 --> 1:04:23.527
- That's very gratuitous.
- Submarine.

1:04:23.527 --> 1:04:24.361
- A theater!

1:04:24.394 --> 1:04:25.629
An abandoned theater!

1:04:25.662 --> 1:04:28.332
With concessions.
- They got beer?

1:04:28.332 --> 1:04:32.002
- Guys, we're
hungry, I'm starving.

1:04:32.002 --> 1:04:33.904
Let's kill two birds
with one stone,

1:04:33.904 --> 1:04:34.905
or one shot!

1:04:36.373 --> 1:04:38.042
Huh?
- Really?

1:04:38.042 --> 1:04:40.978
- Okay, come on, let's go.

1:04:41.011 --> 1:04:43.747
(dramatic music)

1:04:55.492 --> 1:04:56.326
Action!

1:05:00.564 --> 1:05:02.099
- Sam!

1:05:02.099 --> 1:05:05.269
Listen, why are
you filming this?

1:05:05.269 --> 1:05:07.171
- Stay in character.

1:05:07.204 --> 1:05:11.041
- I would love to, but I do
not know what I am playing.

1:05:11.041 --> 1:05:13.377
- Fellatio, just go with it,

1:05:13.377 --> 1:05:14.711
you're screwing up the scene.

1:05:14.711 --> 1:05:15.879
- Alright guys, we've
got to do this again.

1:05:15.879 --> 1:05:17.381
Please, stop breaking
the fourth wall.

1:05:17.414 --> 1:05:20.384
- Negative, this is a
search and destroy mission,

1:05:20.384 --> 1:05:22.886
there's only one way; forward!

1:05:25.122 --> 1:05:27.757
- Follow the man with the gun.

1:05:27.757 --> 1:05:30.127
(soft music)

1:05:42.706 --> 1:05:44.608
- Nut up, ya pansies,
I'm covering the rear.

1:05:44.608 --> 1:05:46.410
- Yes captain, my captain.

1:05:46.443 --> 1:05:51.148
- Guys, stay together, we've
got to make sure it's clear.

1:06:05.095 --> 1:06:06.430
- Hey, Fellatio!

1:06:08.632 --> 1:06:09.966
- Holy shit, ah!

1:06:15.805 --> 1:06:16.640
Okay.

1:06:19.809 --> 1:06:22.112
(laughs)

1:06:22.146 --> 1:06:23.247
Look at that.

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:28.518
- There's a concessions.

1:06:28.518 --> 1:06:29.519
Okay, Popper, take this.

1:06:29.519 --> 1:06:30.354
- Yup.

1:06:32.256 --> 1:06:36.160
- Okay, Tibo, Jojo, try
to sneak around, right?

1:06:37.327 --> 1:06:38.795
You gotta get back there
but there are zombies,

1:06:38.828 --> 1:06:42.532
so try to get as close
as you can to them, okay?

1:06:48.338 --> 1:06:51.175
Alright, alright, are you ready?

1:06:51.175 --> 1:06:52.809
(growling)
- Ah, shit!

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:53.843
(yelling)

1:06:53.843 --> 1:06:55.045
Shit, shit!

1:06:55.112 --> 1:06:57.114
Help, she's gonna bite me!

1:06:57.147 --> 1:06:58.148
- Okay, I got you, I got you!

1:06:58.182 --> 1:06:59.116
- I'm acting.

1:06:59.116 --> 1:06:59.949
- Shit!

1:06:59.949 --> 1:07:00.684
(yelling)

1:07:00.684 --> 1:07:01.518
Shit!

1:07:01.518 --> 1:07:02.519
You gotta get her!

1:07:02.519 --> 1:07:03.853
She's gonna bite
me, I'm serious!

1:07:03.853 --> 1:07:05.189
What are you doing?

1:07:05.222 --> 1:07:06.056
Get the shot!

1:07:06.056 --> 1:07:07.057
- Okay, okay!

1:07:07.057 --> 1:07:08.392
- Oh my God, oh God!

1:07:08.458 --> 1:07:09.959
- I'm getting the shot!

1:07:09.959 --> 1:07:10.960
- She's gonna kill me!

1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.962
No I'm actually serious!

1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:17.801
Did you get the shot?

1:07:17.834 --> 1:07:19.236
- I don't know, I
was really confused.

1:07:19.236 --> 1:07:20.070
- Yeah.

1:07:20.070 --> 1:07:21.305
- Let's go, men!

1:07:21.338 --> 1:07:23.006
We are in hostile territory!
- Oh shit.

1:07:23.006 --> 1:07:25.975
Get up, get up, get up!
- Come on, come on!

1:07:25.975 --> 1:07:28.312
- that's a negative,
Horatio, time to go, come on!

1:07:28.312 --> 1:07:30.647
- I cut this guy's head off!

1:07:33.049 --> 1:07:34.751
This is my moment.

1:07:34.818 --> 1:07:36.520
- Hey, hey!
- What?

1:07:36.553 --> 1:07:38.855
- I think it's Carl.

1:07:38.855 --> 1:07:40.090
It's Carl, man!

1:07:42.692 --> 1:07:43.760
- Wait, wait.

1:07:44.928 --> 1:07:46.430
- Get the, get the
camera, get the camera!

1:07:46.430 --> 1:07:48.932
- I don't think he notices us.

1:07:50.767 --> 1:07:51.601
I got it, man!

1:07:51.601 --> 1:07:52.436
I got it!

1:07:52.436 --> 1:07:53.270
- Good job!

1:07:53.270 --> 1:07:54.771
- Thanks, Carl!

1:07:54.771 --> 1:07:56.340
- We miss you, bro!

1:07:58.342 --> 1:08:01.911
- To be, or not to be,
that is the question.

1:08:04.614 --> 1:08:06.116
- Go, go, oh shit!

1:08:07.050 --> 1:08:08.051
Shit!

1:08:08.084 --> 1:08:08.918
Fuck!

1:08:08.918 --> 1:08:10.287
- Go, go, go, go!

1:08:10.287 --> 1:08:13.022
- Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

1:08:14.424 --> 1:08:16.693
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

1:08:16.726 --> 1:08:20.264
- Grab the door, hold
it, hold it, hold it!

1:08:21.631 --> 1:08:23.233
- This way, troops!

1:08:42.619 --> 1:08:43.720
- Oh man, oh!

1:08:45.755 --> 1:08:46.923
He's been bit!

1:08:48.792 --> 1:08:50.594
What are we going to do?

1:08:50.594 --> 1:08:52.262
- I'm leaving, let's go.

1:08:52.296 --> 1:08:54.464
(yelling)

1:08:55.599 --> 1:08:56.500
- [Sam] Horatio, you're
going to be alright,

1:08:56.500 --> 1:08:57.434
we're going to get you help.

1:08:57.467 --> 1:08:59.102
- Oh give it a rest, Sam,

1:08:59.102 --> 1:09:01.137
you know the script.

1:09:01.137 --> 1:09:02.739
God that hurts!

1:09:02.772 --> 1:09:03.640
That hurts!

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:08.111
- Can you actually
feel it coursing

1:09:08.144 --> 1:09:09.279
through your veins?

1:09:09.279 --> 1:09:10.580
- Uh, Sam, you
should see this, bro.

1:09:10.580 --> 1:09:12.115
- Sam, Sam, listen to me!

1:09:12.148 --> 1:09:14.017
- Now is not a good time,
not a good time, you guys!

1:09:14.017 --> 1:09:15.185
- Sam!
- What?

1:09:15.252 --> 1:09:16.186
What, fine!

1:09:16.186 --> 1:09:18.322
What, what do you want?

1:09:18.322 --> 1:09:20.324
- Come here, Sam.

1:09:20.357 --> 1:09:22.025
- No.
- Sam, listen.

1:09:22.091 --> 1:09:24.261
For fucks sake, I'm not
going to bite you, Sam,

1:09:24.294 --> 1:09:25.495
just come here.

1:09:26.696 --> 1:09:28.265
- Okay.
- God!

1:09:28.298 --> 1:09:29.132
- Sam, no.

1:09:32.369 --> 1:09:35.038
- Hey, I'll be alright.

1:09:35.038 --> 1:09:36.340
I'll be alright.

1:09:37.607 --> 1:09:38.842
Here.

1:09:38.842 --> 1:09:39.676
- Mhm.

1:09:41.010 --> 1:09:42.111
It's your life.

1:09:42.111 --> 1:09:43.513
- Sam, Sam, Sam, listen to me,

1:09:43.513 --> 1:09:45.715
I want to tell you something.

1:09:45.782 --> 1:09:49.453
I want to ask you
something, rather.

1:09:49.486 --> 1:09:50.987
Look at me.

1:09:51.020 --> 1:09:52.456
- Okay.

1:09:52.456 --> 1:09:55.659
- Do you know how
much your films suck?

1:09:57.627 --> 1:09:59.496
They are horrible, Sam.

1:10:00.630 --> 1:10:01.465
- Okay.

1:10:01.465 --> 1:10:02.299
- Stop it, Sam!

1:10:02.299 --> 1:10:03.132
Look at me, look at me!

1:10:03.132 --> 1:10:04.501
- Okay, Horatio!

1:10:04.534 --> 1:10:08.171
I'm looking at you.
- They are horrendous, Sam!

1:10:09.473 --> 1:10:13.142
You are a talentless
sack of shit, but this,

1:10:16.413 --> 1:10:19.015
this is something truly genius.

1:10:19.916 --> 1:10:20.750
Sam.

1:10:21.851 --> 1:10:25.255
This could be something
really special.

1:10:25.255 --> 1:10:26.490
- Okay.

1:10:26.523 --> 1:10:30.193
- You need a good zombie
transformation scene.

1:10:33.897 --> 1:10:34.731
Voila!

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:39.769
Just make sure that you get it.

1:10:41.405 --> 1:10:42.772
Don't fuck it up!

1:10:43.707 --> 1:10:45.074
- Okay!

1:10:45.074 --> 1:10:46.343
- Promise me.

1:10:46.376 --> 1:10:48.077
- Okay, I promise.

1:10:48.077 --> 1:10:50.714
- Okay, we should
get to filming,

1:10:50.747 --> 1:10:53.450
I'm really starting
not to feel good.

1:10:53.450 --> 1:10:54.884
(yelling)

1:10:54.918 --> 1:10:56.052
Ooh the anger!

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:00.457
- Okay.

1:11:00.524 --> 1:11:02.191
- Okay, just um,
turn it on Popper,

1:11:02.225 --> 1:11:03.360
turn on the camera, turn it on.

1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:04.561
- I'm rolling, I'm rolling.

1:11:04.594 --> 1:11:07.364
- Okay, everyone
settle, alright?

1:11:07.364 --> 1:11:08.765
Quiet on the set.

1:11:09.733 --> 1:11:10.600
Ready?

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:11.435
- Yeah.

1:11:11.468 --> 1:11:12.736
- Sam, this isn't right.

1:11:12.769 --> 1:11:14.538
We should be finding him help.

1:11:14.538 --> 1:11:16.940
- Pam, I'm about to
shoot the most important

1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:19.543
scene of my life, and his life,

1:11:20.777 --> 1:11:22.612
which is just about over.

1:11:22.612 --> 1:11:24.280
So just let me freakin' do this.

1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:25.782
- Sam, this isn't okay!

1:11:25.815 --> 1:11:27.116
- Alright, Tiffany.

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:28.084
You're up.
- No, no, no!

1:11:28.117 --> 1:11:29.118
I'm not going near him!

1:11:29.118 --> 1:11:30.119
- You are in the scene!

1:11:30.119 --> 1:11:31.120
- I don't care!

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:32.121
No!

1:11:32.121 --> 1:11:32.822
Dani will do it,
Dani will do it!

1:11:32.822 --> 1:11:33.823
- No!
- Fine.

1:11:33.890 --> 1:11:34.824
Dani, you're in.

1:11:34.824 --> 1:11:35.659
Come on!

1:11:35.659 --> 1:11:36.493
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

1:11:36.493 --> 1:11:37.994
Right here, right here.

1:11:37.994 --> 1:11:42.632
- Let's go, people, I am
actually dying over here.

1:11:42.632 --> 1:11:45.301
- Come on, c'mon buddy, c'mon!

1:11:45.335 --> 1:11:48.405
Turn around, face
to camera, alright.

1:11:49.473 --> 1:11:50.840
Popper, here we go.

1:11:50.907 --> 1:11:52.008
This is the shot!

1:11:52.008 --> 1:11:53.410
- I got the shot.

1:11:56.112 --> 1:11:56.913
- Okay.

1:11:58.314 --> 1:12:02.452
Okay, this is the scene,
you found your best friend,

1:12:02.486 --> 1:12:04.087
he's been bitten.

1:12:04.087 --> 1:12:06.423
- Are you ready Ocean Spray?

1:12:07.524 --> 1:12:08.492
- Yeah.

1:12:08.492 --> 1:12:09.759
- Okay, action!

1:12:13.497 --> 1:12:16.600
- I always knew that this town

1:12:16.633 --> 1:12:19.769
was going to be the death of me!

1:12:19.769 --> 1:12:23.773
All of these fat asses,
taking up all the space.

1:12:25.174 --> 1:12:27.677
With their oversized derrieres

1:12:29.145 --> 1:12:33.116
and their abundant bottoms
and their kingsize rumps!

1:12:38.321 --> 1:12:39.155
Run!

1:12:41.791 --> 1:12:44.628
Run.
(farting)

1:12:44.628 --> 1:12:46.863
You can still get out,

1:12:46.863 --> 1:12:49.799
unless you let the
ones like me go.

1:12:54.404 --> 1:12:55.705
Shoot me!

1:12:55.705 --> 1:12:56.540
- Spray!

1:12:56.540 --> 1:12:57.541
Say the line.

1:12:58.575 --> 1:12:59.876
Come on, say your line, man!

1:12:59.876 --> 1:13:00.710
- Shoot me!

1:13:02.045 --> 1:13:03.647
Shoot me, shoot me.

1:13:05.214 --> 1:13:07.083
You skinny little shit!

1:13:08.752 --> 1:13:12.589
Before I eat your little
slut of a girlfriend!

1:13:14.157 --> 1:13:16.025
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1:13:17.393 --> 1:13:18.394
I'm com, ah!

1:13:20.930 --> 1:13:22.165
- Ocean!

1:13:22.198 --> 1:13:23.366
- This is fucked up.

1:13:23.366 --> 1:13:24.534
Is he supposed to do that?

1:13:24.568 --> 1:13:26.903
- Dude, that's
not in the script!

1:13:26.903 --> 1:13:28.237
- He's a zombie!

1:13:29.238 --> 1:13:31.374
- Man, fuck this shit!

1:13:31.407 --> 1:13:33.376
These are our
friends, you shoot it!

1:13:33.376 --> 1:13:34.544
- Fine!

1:13:34.578 --> 1:13:35.411
Eldad!

1:13:36.279 --> 1:13:37.213
- Maestro!

1:13:37.246 --> 1:13:39.248
- Sam, what are you doing?

1:13:39.248 --> 1:13:40.249
- This is great.

1:13:40.249 --> 1:13:41.585
- These are your friends!

1:13:41.585 --> 1:13:44.420
- And I will tell their story!

1:13:44.454 --> 1:13:46.456
(yelling)

1:13:46.523 --> 1:13:48.692
(gun firing)

1:13:48.725 --> 1:13:49.959
- Dammit!

1:13:49.959 --> 1:13:51.427
Dammit, who did that?

1:13:51.427 --> 1:13:52.929
I did not say cut!

1:13:52.962 --> 1:13:57.400
- Sorry, Sam, I can't let
Horatio go out like that.

1:13:57.433 --> 1:13:58.868
- (speaks in foreign
language) brother.

1:13:58.868 --> 1:14:00.103
- Have you lost your mind?

1:14:00.103 --> 1:14:01.437
This is sick!

1:14:01.437 --> 1:14:03.607
- I have this under control.

1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:04.941
- Under control?

1:14:04.941 --> 1:14:05.942
- What is happening?

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:07.443
I thought he had to get bit!

1:14:07.443 --> 1:14:08.812
Did anyone see him get bit?

1:14:08.878 --> 1:14:10.446
- Have we all lost our minds?

1:14:10.446 --> 1:14:13.950
- Did anyone see anything
unusual with Ocean?

1:14:13.950 --> 1:14:16.119
- He had the serious cause
of the munchies, guys.

1:14:16.152 --> 1:14:18.988
He ate like five
of these bitches!

1:14:21.958 --> 1:14:24.561
- Shit, it's the Freedom Cakes!

1:14:24.561 --> 1:14:26.730
(yelling)

1:14:31.267 --> 1:14:34.003
- Oh my God, I
baked those things.

1:14:34.003 --> 1:14:35.338
Does that mean I'm
going to turn into one?

1:14:35.338 --> 1:14:36.172
How do I look?

1:14:36.172 --> 1:14:37.240
- Stay away from me!

1:14:37.273 --> 1:14:38.742
Those are gross!

1:14:38.742 --> 1:14:41.778
- We bake to box at least
50,000 of those a day!

1:14:41.811 --> 1:14:43.580
We just shipped a
shit ton of them out.

1:14:43.580 --> 1:14:44.581
- Where?

1:14:44.614 --> 1:14:45.782
- Nationwide!

1:14:45.815 --> 1:14:48.184
- Oh my God, we're
all gonna die!

1:14:49.653 --> 1:14:50.854
- We've got incoming, people.

1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:52.421
Let's go, let's go,
into the theater!

1:14:52.421 --> 1:14:53.657
- What about Horatio?

1:14:53.657 --> 1:14:54.457
- There's nothing we
can do for him now.

1:14:54.490 --> 1:14:55.992
Let's go, come on!

1:14:57.193 --> 1:14:58.127
- Ocean!

1:14:58.161 --> 1:14:59.195
- Come on Jessie, we have to go!

1:14:59.195 --> 1:15:01.698
We have to go, Jessie, come on!

1:15:04.834 --> 1:15:06.502
- Are you guys insane?

1:15:06.502 --> 1:15:08.772
We are going to
finish this film,

1:15:08.772 --> 1:15:10.674
we are going to be famous!

1:15:10.674 --> 1:15:12.475
Get back in here!

1:15:12.508 --> 1:15:13.677
Come on!

1:15:13.677 --> 1:15:15.344
Oh, do it for Horatio!

1:15:15.344 --> 1:15:18.014
(intense music)

1:15:34.864 --> 1:15:36.532
- Come on, shh, shh.

1:15:39.035 --> 1:15:40.904
Come on, lock the door.

1:15:40.904 --> 1:15:42.038
- Okay, okay, I got it.

1:15:42.038 --> 1:15:42.872
- Popper!

1:15:42.872 --> 1:15:43.707
I'm sorry, alright?

1:15:43.707 --> 1:15:44.540
I lost my head, man.

1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:45.541
We gotta go!

1:15:47.210 --> 1:15:48.544
What the?

1:15:48.578 --> 1:15:50.079
- Sam, stay in character.

1:15:50.146 --> 1:15:51.815
You gotta stay in
character, Sam.

1:15:51.815 --> 1:15:53.049
- A dolly shot?

1:15:54.417 --> 1:15:55.251
Okay.

1:16:02.826 --> 1:16:04.661
- Why am I not a zombie?

1:16:04.694 --> 1:16:05.695
- Popper!

1:16:05.729 --> 1:16:06.996
- Hey.
- Popper, holy shit,

1:16:06.996 --> 1:16:08.164
we gotta get out of here, man.

1:16:08.164 --> 1:16:09.899
- Dude, look at this.

1:16:09.899 --> 1:16:10.934
- Woah.

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:12.568
- Zombie hotties!

1:16:12.568 --> 1:16:13.770
We gotta get this shot!

1:16:13.837 --> 1:16:15.672
Yeah, you wanna
stream this movie?

1:16:15.672 --> 1:16:17.173
Dudes are gonna look,
they're gonna see

1:16:17.173 --> 1:16:20.176
no titties, sausagefest,
they go right through it.

1:16:20.209 --> 1:16:21.244
- Yeah.
- Oh!

1:16:22.545 --> 1:16:23.613
- I don't have the camera.

1:16:23.613 --> 1:16:24.881
- What?

1:16:24.914 --> 1:16:26.850
- Dude, we just got
to get out of here!

1:16:26.850 --> 1:16:28.217
- Catch up to ya.

1:16:32.756 --> 1:16:35.625
- Been saving this
for a long time.

1:16:37.894 --> 1:16:39.428
I call it El Morte.

1:16:41.765 --> 1:16:43.132
It's inside here.

1:16:45.434 --> 1:16:46.269
Yeah.

1:16:49.205 --> 1:16:51.040
- El Morte?
- El Morte.

1:16:52.441 --> 1:16:54.543
- Dude, that wouldn't even
get a fifth grader high.

1:16:54.577 --> 1:16:55.812
- Oh!

1:16:55.812 --> 1:16:57.714
Famous last words, man.

1:16:59.716 --> 1:17:00.583
Ready?

1:17:00.616 --> 1:17:01.450
- Yeah.

1:17:03.753 --> 1:17:05.922
(yelling)

1:17:08.491 --> 1:17:11.327
- Oh, the Freedom Cakes.

1:17:11.327 --> 1:17:13.096
Oh wait, the Freedom Cakes.

1:17:13.129 --> 1:17:15.331
The, the, I'm not a zombie!

1:17:19.836 --> 1:17:21.805
Oh my God, I'm not a zombie.

1:17:21.805 --> 1:17:24.140
I am not, I am not a zombie.

1:17:27.610 --> 1:17:29.478
- What's your name?

1:17:29.478 --> 1:17:30.947
(yelling)

1:17:30.980 --> 1:17:34.350
- And now we have exclusive
footage for you from Corsicana,

1:17:34.350 --> 1:17:36.786
and the carnage that
is happening there.

1:17:36.820 --> 1:17:38.454
People are rioting, screaming,

1:17:38.454 --> 1:17:40.623
you'll notice fires
in the streets.

1:17:40.623 --> 1:17:43.693
People appear to be in
nothing but survival mode,

1:17:43.693 --> 1:17:45.661
using just their wits

1:17:45.661 --> 1:17:48.331
and their surroundings
to survive what can only

1:17:48.331 --> 1:17:51.868
understandably be viewed
as the apocalypse.

1:17:56.172 --> 1:17:58.674
- These people are so blasted!

1:18:01.377 --> 1:18:04.547
- Why aren't your lips moving?

1:18:04.613 --> 1:18:06.682
- Isn't that your sister?

1:18:07.984 --> 1:18:10.619
- Are my eyes still there?

1:18:10.619 --> 1:18:12.021
- We're in Texas.

1:18:20.163 --> 1:18:22.899
- Come on, come on, come on.

1:18:22.899 --> 1:18:25.534
Yeah get back, come on, come on.

1:18:25.534 --> 1:18:28.204
(horns honking)

1:18:29.873 --> 1:18:32.408
(wind howling)

1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:44.888
- [Sam] But look at them all.

1:18:44.888 --> 1:18:46.055
These are my people.

1:18:46.055 --> 1:18:47.891
They all want me, finally,

1:18:47.891 --> 1:18:51.928
this whole town wants
me, they need me.

1:18:51.995 --> 1:18:55.398
You can do this, Sam,
your day has come!

1:18:55.398 --> 1:18:57.166
(farting)

1:18:57.200 --> 1:18:58.534
- Hey!

1:18:58.567 --> 1:19:02.405
I'm all out of bullets,
I'm going hand to hand!

1:19:06.876 --> 1:19:08.111
- What are we going to do?

1:19:08.111 --> 1:19:10.579
- Why don't we just
film ourselves dying?

1:19:10.579 --> 1:19:12.715
- That's a great idea, buddy.

1:19:12.748 --> 1:19:14.517
- Alright, I'm going
to draw them away.

1:19:14.517 --> 1:19:15.919
I'm going that way, you guys.

1:19:15.919 --> 1:19:19.088
Get o the streets, try
to get out of town.

1:19:19.122 --> 1:19:20.857
- Sam, no, you don't
have to do this!

1:19:20.890 --> 1:19:22.558
- Pam, I'm so sorry.

1:19:26.229 --> 1:19:27.630
This is my fault.

1:19:29.899 --> 1:19:33.369
Thank you, thank you for
always believing in me.

1:19:33.369 --> 1:19:34.804
- Sam, Sam, no, you
don't have to do this.

1:19:34.804 --> 1:19:35.872
- I love you.

1:19:49.986 --> 1:19:50.887
- Sam!

1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:52.155
(yelling)

1:19:52.155 --> 1:19:53.556
Sam, Sam, no!
- Come on!

1:19:53.589 --> 1:19:54.457
Come on!

1:19:54.457 --> 1:19:55.458
Let's go!

1:19:55.458 --> 1:19:56.792
Come on!

1:19:56.792 --> 1:19:59.395
- Go get 'em, Sammy!
- Really?

1:19:59.428 --> 1:20:01.797
Why does anyone ever
listen to that guy?

1:20:01.797 --> 1:20:02.798
- Come on!

1:20:02.798 --> 1:20:03.900
Let's go, come on, here!

1:20:03.933 --> 1:20:04.834
Come on!

1:20:04.834 --> 1:20:05.835
Here we go, come on!

1:20:05.902 --> 1:20:08.137
This way, come on, come on.

1:20:10.239 --> 1:20:12.341
I'm delicious, I'm tasty,

1:20:12.341 --> 1:20:13.409

1:20:13.442 --> 1:20:14.643
Take a bite of me!

1:20:14.643 --> 1:20:18.814
Yeah, yeah alright, yeah
you want some of this!

1:20:18.814 --> 1:20:20.083
Yeah!

1:20:20.116 --> 1:20:22.986
Muscle, a little bit
of fat for ya, yeah!

1:20:22.986 --> 1:20:24.320
I'm a tasty man!

1:20:26.122 --> 1:20:28.457
Right here, right here, yeah!

1:20:28.457 --> 1:20:29.825
Look at these meaty thighs!

1:20:29.825 --> 1:20:33.029
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1:20:33.096 --> 1:20:35.264
(yelling)

1:20:49.778 --> 1:20:50.646
Well, shit.

1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:53.182
Yeah, I'm a dead man.

1:20:53.182 --> 1:20:55.018
Great idea, Samuel.

1:20:55.051 --> 1:20:58.387
Look at this, that kid is
eating his mom's kneecap!

1:20:58.454 --> 1:20:59.889
I have never seen
that, oh my God,

1:20:59.889 --> 1:21:03.292
I don't even know what
that guy's eating.

1:21:03.326 --> 1:21:04.493
What the hell?

1:21:08.231 --> 1:21:09.065
Dammit.

1:21:09.999 --> 1:21:11.700
Zombie rain?

1:21:11.700 --> 1:21:15.038
Figures, now the heavens are
raining production value.

1:21:15.038 --> 1:21:16.372
Man, this hurts!

1:21:17.540 --> 1:21:20.709
Man, this movie was
going to be beautiful.

1:21:28.251 --> 1:21:31.154
Feels good to
finally nail my part.

1:21:38.494 --> 1:21:39.328
Eldad?

1:21:40.263 --> 1:21:41.597
Nice shot, Eldad.

1:21:41.664 --> 1:21:45.001
(speaks in foreign language)

1:21:45.001 --> 1:21:46.569
- Sam, Sam!

1:21:46.569 --> 1:21:47.570
Sam, you're gonna be okay,

1:21:47.603 --> 1:21:48.938
we're gonna get you help.

1:21:48.938 --> 1:21:52.108
- I'm sorry, guys, I'm
a shitty filmmaker.

1:21:52.108 --> 1:21:53.276
- Yeah, yeah you are.

1:21:53.342 --> 1:21:55.511
- What the hell is this?

1:21:55.511 --> 1:21:58.447
(yelling)

1:21:58.447 --> 1:22:00.349
- We're gonna get you
help, little buddy.

1:22:00.383 --> 1:22:01.550
C'mon.

1:22:01.550 --> 1:22:02.952
- Come on, come on, come on!

1:22:02.952 --> 1:22:03.786
Go, go, go!

1:22:03.786 --> 1:22:05.688
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:22:07.923 --> 1:22:10.960
- [Tiffany] Hurry,
he's losing blood.

1:22:17.133 --> 1:22:17.967
- Come on now, guys.

1:22:17.967 --> 1:22:19.468
Hold up, wait on me!

1:22:19.535 --> 1:22:20.936
I got a bad knee!

1:22:22.972 --> 1:22:24.307
You sons of bitches!

1:22:24.373 --> 1:22:26.375
I saved your lives
about 12 times tonight!

1:22:26.409 --> 1:22:27.243
C'mon now!

1:22:28.978 --> 1:22:31.247
(laughing)

1:22:40.456 --> 1:22:45.161
- [Sam] I always knew this
town would be the death of me.

1:22:46.629 --> 1:22:47.896
- What's this?

1:22:47.930 --> 1:22:49.332
A red carpet premiere
into the great beyond?

1:22:49.332 --> 1:22:50.566
Nope.

1:22:50.599 --> 1:22:52.235
Turns out getting
bit just hurts,

1:22:52.235 --> 1:22:54.803
it doesn't actually
turn you into one.

1:22:54.803 --> 1:22:57.440
When the world goes to
shit, it's a gift I say.

1:22:57.473 --> 1:22:59.675
What I needed was just
a little chaos to get

1:22:59.675 --> 1:23:02.678
my shot, and it happened,
they gave it to me.

1:23:02.678 --> 1:23:04.980
I got money, honey
wagons, respect,

1:23:04.980 --> 1:23:07.650
20 something interns
happy as hell to get me

1:23:07.650 --> 1:23:09.152
some shitty coffee drink.

1:23:09.185 --> 1:23:12.421
I don't even like coffee,
I get one every 20 minutes!

1:23:12.455 --> 1:23:13.856
God it feels good!

1:23:13.856 --> 1:23:15.358
- I am beyond excited!

1:23:15.424 --> 1:23:17.826
- Well I play myself,
so that's fun.

1:23:17.826 --> 1:23:19.095
- Jojo!

1:23:19.128 --> 1:23:21.630
- And that's where I get
to meet my leading man.

1:23:21.664 --> 1:23:23.832
(yelling)

1:23:35.044 --> 1:23:36.045
- It's the best day of my life,

1:23:36.045 --> 1:23:37.380
thank you all so much!

1:23:37.380 --> 1:23:38.881
Thank you, Corsicana!

1:23:38.881 --> 1:23:40.149
- And spoiler alert,

1:23:40.183 --> 1:23:42.351
are you guys expecting?

1:23:42.351 --> 1:23:45.388
- Well we were expecting
to keep it a secret.

1:23:45.388 --> 1:23:46.722
- I will see you in there!

1:23:46.722 --> 1:23:47.556
Come on!

1:23:50.393 --> 1:23:51.960
- As I sit here watching this,

1:23:51.994 --> 1:23:54.630
it's like it's not me,
it's some different

1:23:54.630 --> 1:23:56.632
version of me; an
imposter, it's a fake!

1:23:56.665 --> 1:23:58.701
Which it is, I mean,
Ryan Reynolds looks

1:23:58.701 --> 1:23:59.968
nothing like me.

1:24:00.002 --> 1:24:01.670
I can't help but think
what would have happened

1:24:01.704 --> 1:24:04.373
if I had actually gotten
into that shitty festival,

1:24:04.373 --> 1:24:05.641
or what would have happened

1:24:05.641 --> 1:24:08.211
if I hadn't lied about
the whole damn thing.

1:24:08.211 --> 1:24:10.079
Oh well, by the
looks of the reviews,

1:24:10.146 --> 1:24:11.814
I'm not getting
the chance to make

1:24:11.847 --> 1:24:13.349
Fat Ass Zombies 2 anytime soon.

1:24:13.382 --> 1:24:15.484
That's okay, I kind
of had my heart

1:24:15.484 --> 1:24:19.355
on making Zombie Space
Vikings 2: The Horny Revenge.

1:24:19.388 --> 1:24:21.324
- [Reporter] Parents beware,
the Freedom Cake Challenge

1:24:21.324 --> 1:24:23.426
is sweeping social media.

1:24:23.426 --> 1:24:24.860
Teenagers are finding
the deadly cakes

1:24:24.893 --> 1:24:26.762
that haven't been
turned in and destroyed

1:24:26.762 --> 1:24:29.565
by the authorities and are
filming themselves eating them.

1:24:29.565 --> 1:24:31.434
This is a very
dangerous situation,

1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:33.936
and we urge anyone with
knowledge of any cakes

1:24:33.936 --> 1:24:36.705
still not turned in to
report it immediately.

1:24:36.739 --> 1:24:39.275
And parents, please
make sure you speak

1:24:39.275 --> 1:24:41.944
to your children about the
dangers of these cakes,

1:24:41.944 --> 1:24:43.912
and also have Colin
Street Bakery Honey

1:24:43.912 --> 1:24:45.214
in your cupboard.

1:24:45.248 --> 1:24:47.049
As we reported earlier,
this honey was found

1:24:47.049 --> 1:24:49.718
to be the only antidote
for anyone poisoned

1:24:49.752 --> 1:24:51.520
by eating the cakes.

1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:54.557
(intense rock music)

1:25:00.863 --> 1:25:02.698
* It

1:25:02.731 --> 1:25:05.634
* Ain't real

1:25:05.634 --> 1:25:10.473
* Am I what I'm supposed to be

1:25:10.473 --> 1:25:12.875
* I fear

1:25:12.908 --> 1:25:15.578
* I'll disappear

1:25:15.578 --> 1:25:20.583
* I'm losing touch with myself

1:25:21.784 --> 1:25:24.153
* I dunno when to brace myself

1:25:24.153 --> 1:25:26.455
* I dunno when to brace myself

1:25:26.455 --> 1:25:28.957
* I dunno when to brace myself

1:25:28.957 --> 1:25:30.926
* I dunno

1:25:30.959 --> 1:25:34.163
* 'Cause I'm displaced

1:25:41.437 --> 1:25:43.406
* It

1:25:43.406 --> 1:25:46.442
* Ain't real

1:25:46.475 --> 1:25:51.480
* Am I where I'm
supposed to be *

1:25:52.114 --> 1:25:53.949
* I fear

1:25:53.949 --> 1:25:56.785
* I'll disappear

1:25:56.819 --> 1:26:01.757
* I'm losing touch with myself

1:26:02.658 --> 1:26:05.160
* I dunno when to brace myself

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:07.530
* I dunno when to brace myself

1:26:07.596 --> 1:26:10.132
* I dunno when to brace myself

1:26:10.165 --> 1:26:12.034
* I dunno

1:26:12.034 --> 1:26:15.271
* 'Cause I'm displaced

1:26:25.781 --> 1:26:28.284
(funky music)

1:26:36.625 --> 1:26:38.961
* Better get jumpin'

1:26:38.994 --> 1:26:41.464
* Here come the boogeyman

1:26:41.464 --> 1:26:43.966
* Better get bumpin'

1:26:43.999 --> 1:26:46.369
* Here come the boogeyman

1:26:46.369 --> 1:26:48.871
* Better get jumpin'

1:26:48.904 --> 1:26:51.507
* Here come the boogeyman

1:26:51.540 --> 1:26:53.809
* Better get walkin'

1:26:53.809 --> 1:26:56.645
* Here come the boogeyman

1:26:56.679 --> 1:27:01.584
* When the boogeyman
lose his heart *

1:27:04.052 --> 1:27:08.724
* When the boogeyman,
his eyes get lost *
