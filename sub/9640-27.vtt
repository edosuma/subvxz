WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:06.372
OK, guys, Juliet's gonna
be here any minute.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.341
How do I look?

00:11.220 --> 00:14.161
You think the boutonniere's over the top?
Is a little bit, huh?

00:14.196 --> 00:16.627
What about my candelabrum?

00:16.662 --> 00:19.764
It would be fine, if you had
a hunchback and a bell tower.

00:19.799 --> 00:21.628
[candelabrum clangs]

00:21.662 --> 00:24.424
Justin, relax. It's gonna be fine.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.824
Well, it's just this
is the first meal

00:26.190 --> 00:27.590
Juliet's having with our family

00:27.824 --> 00:29.557
and, you know, I don't
want anything to go wrong.

00:29.592 --> 00:31.921
Oh, what could possibly go wrong?

00:31.956 --> 00:33.619
I think tonight might be the night

00:33.653 --> 00:36.408
I try to eat my dinner blindfolded.

00:36.443 --> 00:40.410
But then you wouldn't
know what you were eating.

00:40.445 --> 00:42.510
You should do it.

00:42.545 --> 00:45.844
Dad, give me the socks you're
wearing and some butter. Go.

00:47.644 --> 00:50.175
I don't need butter to eat socks.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.609
Good luck not being ashamed
of all that, sweetie.

00:54.643 --> 00:58.443
Justin's new vampire girlfriend
is coming over for dinner tonight.

00:58.477 --> 01:00.076
I still can't get
used to saying that.

01:00.110 --> 01:01.543
I can.

01:01.578 --> 01:03.344
[singsong] Justin's
got a girlfriend,

01:03.378 --> 01:04.811
a vampire girlfriend.

01:05.045 --> 01:07.012
- Justin's got a girlfriend.
- [Justin] Dad!

01:08.414 --> 01:10.113
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to get out

01:10.414 --> 01:13.213
all of my inappropriate
behavior before she gets here.

01:13.248 --> 01:16.314
Hey, who wants to see
my appendix scar?

01:16.348 --> 01:19.015
[doorbell chimes]

01:19.049 --> 01:20.916
That's her.

01:22.417 --> 01:25.617
Dad, I'm not opening that door
until you put your shirt down.

01:26.651 --> 01:27.651
Good.

01:29.185 --> 01:31.252
OK. [clears throat]

01:34.754 --> 01:36.286
Hi, Justin.

01:36.321 --> 01:39.454
[exhales] Hello, Juliet.

01:39.489 --> 01:42.756
Why, you're a vision of
loveliness and enchantment.

01:42.790 --> 01:46.057
Oh, you're so cute when you
give me old-timey compliments.

01:46.091 --> 01:49.224
Well, you're a vampire.
Vampires are really old, right?

01:49.259 --> 01:53.460
[stammering] I mean, uh,
not that you're old or look old.

01:53.494 --> 01:57.261
You look great for your age.
Which would be...?

01:57.295 --> 02:00.095
Justin, I already told you,
I'm not telling you how old I am.

02:00.130 --> 02:03.597
If I did, you would freak out.
Like Caesar did. Oh, shoot!

02:05.265 --> 02:06.932
[singsong] I'm narrowing it down.

02:06.966 --> 02:09.934
[singsong] Nobody cares.

02:11.202 --> 02:13.502
[clears throat] Yoknow my family.

02:13.536 --> 02:15.402
Hi, guys.

02:15.437 --> 02:17.771
Wow, it smells
really great in here.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.705
Well, I've prepared a special meal

02:19.740 --> 02:22.774
in honor of our special guest.

02:22.808 --> 02:24.942
It's my special...

02:24.976 --> 02:30.711
...ten cheese enchilada surprise.

02:30.745 --> 02:34.246
The surprise is an eleventh cheese!

02:34.280 --> 02:38.616
Eleven cheeses in one dish? Um...

02:38.650 --> 02:40.317
I'm really sorry, Mr.
and Mrs. Russo.

02:40.351 --> 02:42.418
I don't think I can eat that.

02:42.452 --> 02:44.252
I probably should've
mentioned this earlier,

02:44.386 --> 02:47.221
but vampires are kind
of health conscious.

02:48.289 --> 02:50.489
Juliet, you're right.

02:50.524 --> 02:53.991
This cheesy food could
be considered unhealthy.

02:54.025 --> 02:57.560
And my family deserves
better than that.

02:59.495 --> 03:01.929
[exclaims]

03:01.963 --> 03:05.531
From now on, the Russos will
be eating much healthier.

03:05.565 --> 03:07.966
Isn't that right, Jerry?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.233
Get in there and
fight for our cake!

03:09.267 --> 03:11.101
Right.

03:12.936 --> 03:15.571
Sure, honey. You know
how I always support

03:15.605 --> 03:17.638
your unpredictable whims.

03:17.673 --> 03:20.073
Sorry.

03:20.107 --> 03:23.409
Thank you.
Now throw that cake away.

03:24.510 --> 03:26.977
[sighs, whimpers]

03:29.947 --> 03:31.514
[gasps]

03:33.950 --> 03:35.984
[groaning]

03:36.985 --> 03:39.086
[exclaims]

03:39.120 --> 03:41.854
Wow! You've only been
here for a few minutes

03:41.889 --> 03:44.589
and my family's already
better off for knowing you.

03:44.624 --> 03:45.657
You're incredible.

03:45.991 --> 03:48.125
- No, you are, Justin.
- No, you are.

03:48.159 --> 03:49.793
[both simpering] No, you are.

03:49.827 --> 03:51.394
Butterfly kiss!

03:53.596 --> 03:55.863
Wow. well... [laughs]

03:55.897 --> 03:57.731
This just is great.

03:57.765 --> 03:59.298
I'm gonna go take out the trash.

04:06.504 --> 04:08.404
- [door shuts]
- I'm gonna help her.

04:13.242 --> 04:15.376
<i>* Well you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *</i>

04:15.644 --> 04:17.344
<i>* That the end will no doubt
justify the means *</i>

04:17.911 --> 04:19.212
<i>* You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease *</i>

04:19.247 --> 04:21.047
<i>* Yes please *</i>

04:21.082 --> 04:22.882
<i>* But you might find out it'll
go to your head *</i>

04:23.584 --> 04:24.884
<i>* When you write a report on a
book you never read *</i>

04:25.419 --> 04:27.386
<i>* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *</i>

04:27.421 --> 04:28.921
<i>* That's what I said *</i>

04:29.023 --> 04:32.091
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

04:32.126 --> 04:35.930
<i>* When you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *</i>

04:35.964 --> 04:39.732
<i>* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *</i>

04:39.767 --> 04:43.734
<i>* Because everything is
not what it seems *</i>

04:43.769 --> 04:47.303
<i>* Everything is not
what it seems *</i>

04:47.337 --> 04:51.406
<i>* When you can have what you want
by the simplest of means *</i>

04:51.440 --> 04:55.108
<i>* Be careful not to mess with
the balance of things *</i>

04:55.143 --> 04:59.278
<i>* Because everything is not... *</i>

04:59.313 --> 05:02.548
<i>* What it seems *</i>

05:04.751 --> 05:07.585
Thanks to Juliet,
I have seen the error of our ways.

05:07.619 --> 05:09.220
We are throwing out
all of this junk food

05:09.454 --> 05:10.688
and we're never lookin' back.

05:10.822 --> 05:12.355
Wait, Mom. You can't do that.

05:12.390 --> 05:14.056
Of course I can, sweetie.
I'm your mom.

05:14.091 --> 05:16.091
I can do whatever I want.

05:17.627 --> 05:19.061
Well, then I'm out.

05:19.095 --> 05:20.796
I was this close

05:20.830 --> 05:23.532
to eating meals with you
guys out of convenience,

05:23.566 --> 05:25.734
but you, mother,
just put a stop to that.

05:25.768 --> 05:29.103
So thank you for ruining
our family! [sobs]

05:29.138 --> 05:30.905
[laughing] I'm just kidding.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.306
[Alex sighs]

05:32.341 --> 05:34.307
But seriously, I'm not
gonna eat with you guys.

05:34.342 --> 05:36.842
That... that's just so good.

05:39.145 --> 05:42.113
Hi, Juliet.
Guess what's in this bag.

05:42.147 --> 05:45.349
Nothing but junk food.
I could smell it from a mile away.

05:45.383 --> 05:48.185
Vampire sense of smell.
Hey, is Justin around?

05:48.219 --> 05:50.887
[sniffs] Oh, he's upstairs.

05:52.856 --> 05:56.725
Look at you. Cloudy day so
you're out without an umbrella.

05:56.760 --> 05:57.926
Excuse me?

05:58.027 --> 06:00.462
[whispering] I know
you're a vampire.

06:00.496 --> 06:02.764
I'm Harper. And I just
want to let you know

06:02.798 --> 06:04.432
that there are no hard feelings.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.233
Hard feelings? About what?

06:06.268 --> 06:08.435
Oh, Justin didn't tell you?
[scoffs]

06:08.469 --> 06:11.905
That is just like him,
trying to spare other people's feelings.

06:11.939 --> 06:15.408
He and I have had an on-and-off
relationship for years.

06:15.442 --> 06:18.110
We're off now, which is why
you guys are on. So I'm cool.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.545
Whoa, whoa! What's with the garlic?

06:20.579 --> 06:22.279
We were just having a conversation.

06:22.747 --> 06:26.717
Sorry. I just wasn't sure how
this whole thing was gonna go.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.586
So you made a garlic necklace.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.087
No, I actually had it.

06:31.288 --> 06:33.222
It's for this pasta outfit
that I'm working on.

06:33.256 --> 06:37.258
Oh, you're the
food-for-clothes girl.

06:37.292 --> 06:41.261
Yeah, Justin has talked about you.

06:42.263 --> 06:43.931
Yes!

06:45.000 --> 06:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:52.340 --> 06:54.641
So this is our new garden,

06:54.676 --> 06:57.310
where we'll be growing all
sorts of exciting vegetables,

06:57.345 --> 07:00.980
including broccoli, which they
say has near magical qualities.

07:01.014 --> 07:03.348
It'll be magical if
I can get it down

07:03.383 --> 07:05.383
without a warm cheese sauce.

07:09.153 --> 07:12.989
Hmm. Magical qualities, huh?

07:13.023 --> 07:14.357
Did you say something, Max?

07:14.458 --> 07:16.058
Nope. Didn't say a word.

07:18.294 --> 07:22.063
Hmm. Magical qualities, huh.

07:23.231 --> 07:25.866
Let's just pretend we
didn't hear it that time.

07:30.705 --> 07:32.204
Don't let this garden go to waste.

07:32.406 --> 07:34.807
Give all this food
a lot more taste.

07:36.509 --> 07:39.443
Well, that was unexpected.

07:47.852 --> 07:50.286
Man, that Pilates class was great.

07:50.321 --> 07:53.656
I've never felt more physically
or emotionally centered

07:53.690 --> 07:54.857
in all of my life.

07:56.192 --> 07:57.626
Hey Alex, would you
like to join us?

07:58.027 --> 07:59.160
It'd really help
strengthen your core.

07:59.895 --> 08:02.963
Oh, no thanks. I like my core
loose and in front of the TV.

08:15.675 --> 08:19.644
Uh... Dad, aren't those
shorts a little tight?

08:21.480 --> 08:24.181
They're looser than
I thought they'd be.

08:27.918 --> 08:31.753
Oh! Oh, my gosh. What is going on?

08:31.788 --> 08:34.721
A total aerobic workout.
That's what's going on.

08:34.756 --> 08:36.923
The perfect complement
to healthy eating.

08:36.957 --> 08:39.326
- Dad, you're OK with this?
- Yeah, of course.

08:39.360 --> 08:42.395
What's not to be OK with?
It's a great idea.

08:42.429 --> 08:44.432
Let's start stretching, Jerry.

08:44.466 --> 08:47.202
Another great idea.

08:48.504 --> 08:51.339
I just...

08:51.374 --> 08:53.008
Trying to...

08:54.010 --> 08:56.078
Oh!

08:57.180 --> 08:59.581
Wha...? I give up
eating with you people,

08:59.615 --> 09:01.249
and now you're making it impossible

09:01.450 --> 09:04.218
for me to watch
television in my own home?

09:04.252 --> 09:06.520
I'm so desperate, I'm thinking
about going to Harper's house.

09:09.823 --> 09:12.892
[singsong] Hum de dum de dum.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.762
- What are you doing?
- What? Nothing.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.730
[clears throat] Why do you ask?

09:18.765 --> 09:20.865
Because it looks like
you're humming suspiciously

09:20.899 --> 09:22.198
to look casual.

09:22.233 --> 09:25.134
That's exactly what I was doing.

09:25.168 --> 09:27.536
Now, let's see what
you're really up to.

09:30.506 --> 09:32.374
[yelps] Oh!

09:34.577 --> 09:37.312
Max! What did you do?

09:37.346 --> 09:39.347
[Max] Umm...

09:39.381 --> 09:42.116
Well, I just wanted to use magic

09:42.150 --> 09:43.751
to make the vegetables
taste better,

09:43.785 --> 09:46.886
but I've made a giant pumpkin.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.423
I'm going to live in it.

09:51.891 --> 09:55.160
First, I need to carve a
door in the side of it.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.531
Max, that's a spoon.

10:00.565 --> 10:02.499
I know what it's called.

10:11.574 --> 10:14.109
[dinging rhythmically]

10:16.812 --> 10:18.412
Oh.

10:18.447 --> 10:23.050
Alex Russo and friend.
What a pleasant surprise.

10:23.084 --> 10:25.118
What can I get for you?

10:25.153 --> 10:27.687
Your daughter out of my house.

10:27.722 --> 10:30.723
She's made it impossible for
me to eat anything unhealthy.

10:32.892 --> 10:35.093
You know, with all the
time Juliet's been spending

10:35.128 --> 10:38.596
with your brother, we could
use an extra hand around here.

10:38.631 --> 10:40.698
What would you say
to a part-time job

10:40.732 --> 10:42.833
here at the Late Nite Bite?

10:42.867 --> 10:47.837
A job? Well, doesn't sound
like something I'd do,

10:47.871 --> 10:52.039
but it would get me out
of Family Exercise Night.

10:52.074 --> 10:55.542
Look at you. So clever and cunning.

10:55.576 --> 10:57.778
Sometimes we wish
Juliet had more of that.

10:57.812 --> 10:59.846
Yeah, in a lot of ways,

10:59.880 --> 11:02.715
you're probably more like
a vampire than she is.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.383
Oh, thank you.

11:05.785 --> 11:09.320
So it's settled. You'll both
start working here immediately.

11:09.355 --> 11:12.390
Me, too? Yes!

11:13.725 --> 11:16.527
You know, we find
Juliet's health kicks

11:16.561 --> 11:18.161
rather irritating, too.

11:18.263 --> 11:20.897
Really? I thought all vampires
were health conscious.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.900
No, it's mainly just
the younger generation.

11:23.934 --> 11:27.069
They sometimes even try to
get humans to eat better

11:27.104 --> 11:29.838
so they'll have healthier
blood to suck. [chuckles]

11:29.872 --> 11:32.039
They're very fanatical about it.

11:33.241 --> 11:34.608
What did you just say?

11:34.643 --> 11:36.810
I said they're fanatical about it.

11:36.845 --> 11:38.779
No, before that.

11:38.813 --> 11:41.681
I said it's mainly the
younger generation.

11:41.715 --> 11:44.149
Yes, but after that.

11:44.184 --> 11:47.652
Oh, I think she's talking about
the part where you mentioned

11:47.687 --> 11:50.254
how younger vampires try
to get humans healthier

11:50.289 --> 11:53.557
before drinking their
delicious blood.

11:53.591 --> 11:56.560
That's the one. OK, um...

11:56.594 --> 11:58.995
Well, excuse me, just...

12:01.832 --> 12:04.633
[Alex bangs head] Oh!
You've got to be kidding me.

12:04.668 --> 12:06.869
But her shift just started.

12:06.903 --> 12:09.405
I'll cover her shift.
I knew how this was gonna go.

12:09.439 --> 12:11.139
I just didn't think it
would happen so soon.

12:25.543 --> 12:26.777
Max?

12:29.113 --> 12:31.314
There's some mail here for ya.

12:31.348 --> 12:33.616
[Max] Hold on.

12:44.927 --> 12:47.529
This is my mail slot.

12:47.563 --> 12:50.131
Yeah, I get it.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.366
I hope you're not jealous

12:51.834 --> 12:53.234
that I moved out of the
house before you did.

12:54.904 --> 12:59.207
Tell Mommy and Daddy I said,
"Hi." Loser.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.845
OK. I'll tell 'em.

13:05.547 --> 13:08.916
Mom, Dad. The kid living
in the jack-o'-lantern

13:08.950 --> 13:11.085
thinks I'm the loser.

13:12.954 --> 13:16.090
Justin, uh,
let's talk about Juliet.

13:16.124 --> 13:18.892
Isn't she the greatest?
I could talk about her all day.

13:18.926 --> 13:21.694
Yes, she's cute, and she's
looking past your jungle toes,

13:21.729 --> 13:24.496
and we're all really excited
for you, but look...

13:24.531 --> 13:26.398
She wants to drink your blood.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.133
What are you talking about?

13:28.167 --> 13:30.401
I got a job over at
the Late Nite Bite,

13:30.436 --> 13:32.637
and while I was there I found
out that young vampires

13:32.905 --> 13:35.339
like to feed on the healthiest
human blood they can find.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.209
I can't believe it.

13:39.243 --> 13:40.977
You got a job?

13:42.212 --> 13:45.114
- I know, it's weird, huh?
- Totally. Up top!

13:45.148 --> 13:46.649
No! Stop.

13:47.917 --> 13:50.252
I think Juliet is trying
to get you healthy

13:50.286 --> 13:52.254
so she can drink your blood.

13:52.288 --> 13:54.856
Come on, Alex. Juliet's
a vampire with a soul,

13:54.890 --> 13:56.290
so she has a conscience.

13:56.692 --> 13:58.826
That's why she volunteers at
blood banks on the weekends.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.895
Keep talkin'. You're almost there.

14:00.929 --> 14:02.763
And I bet you think it's
weird that she salivates

14:03.198 --> 14:05.399
uncontrollably around me when
I wear v-neck t-shirts, too.

14:06.234 --> 14:07.601
On to sports.

14:08.670 --> 14:10.971
<i>[crowd cheering on TV]</i>

14:11.005 --> 14:13.640
Oh, my gosh! My girlfriend's
gonna suck my blood.

14:15.143 --> 14:18.678
Well, look at that,
you stuck the landing.

14:20.948 --> 14:23.116
Justin.

14:23.151 --> 14:24.784
Juliet!

14:26.753 --> 14:29.622
Vampire speed. Forgot about that.

14:29.656 --> 14:32.791
Hey, why are you wearing a scarf?
It's like 75 degrees out.

14:32.825 --> 14:34.993
I'm not wearing a scarf.

14:35.027 --> 14:38.830
Oh, you mean this? OK,
I'm wearing a scarf.

14:38.864 --> 14:41.398
Why are you acting so weird?

14:41.433 --> 14:44.267
You probably have heat stroke.

14:44.302 --> 14:46.102
Let's get that scarf off.

14:50.373 --> 14:51.372
[yelps]

14:52.908 --> 14:54.475
Hey, so, guess what?

14:54.510 --> 14:57.644
I woke up this evening and
my fangs had come in. Look.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.180
Stay back!

15:02.215 --> 15:05.683
Keep your filthy fangs away
from my perfect, succulent neck!

15:05.718 --> 15:08.852
- Justin! What are you doing?
- Trying to save my life.

15:08.886 --> 15:10.587
Alex told me you're
trying to get me healthy

15:10.721 --> 15:12.355
just so you can drink my blood.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.557
What? No, you're my boyfriend.

15:14.591 --> 15:16.191
I would never do
anything like that.

15:16.226 --> 15:17.793
I know, but Alex said...

15:17.994 --> 15:19.728
Aren't you always saying
your sister's up to no good?

15:19.762 --> 15:21.829
Why would you believe her?

15:21.863 --> 15:24.897
It's a complicated
relationship we have together.

15:24.932 --> 15:28.333
- [stutters, laughs]
- [garlic thumps]

15:28.367 --> 15:31.537
I'm sorry, I should've known
better than to listen to Alex.

15:31.571 --> 15:33.305
Just 'cause she's working
for your parents,

15:33.640 --> 15:35.741
she thinks she's like
some expert on vampires.

15:35.776 --> 15:37.176
She's working for my parents?

15:37.477 --> 15:39.077
Yeah, she's over there
now with Harper.

15:39.111 --> 15:41.345
Oh, my gosh. There's no
easy way to say this,

15:41.379 --> 15:43.480
so I'm just gonna come
right out with it.

15:43.514 --> 15:44.781
OK.

15:44.882 --> 15:46.750
My parents might be planning
to drink their blood.

15:46.784 --> 15:48.584
I love you, too. I...

15:51.255 --> 15:53.289
You didn't say what I
thought you were...

15:53.323 --> 15:55.324
Come on! Let's go
tell your parents!

15:56.059 --> 15:58.661
Mom, Dad...

15:58.695 --> 16:00.662
Juliet said she loved me.

16:02.031 --> 16:04.799
Well, she didn't,
but I thought she was going to.

16:04.834 --> 16:07.035
Justin. Blood drinking.

16:07.070 --> 16:08.837
And she didn't freak
out when I said it.

16:08.872 --> 16:11.073
- Aww.
- Thank you, Mom.

16:11.108 --> 16:13.076
Alex. Harper. Danger.

16:13.110 --> 16:16.012
This is an important milestone
in out relationship.

16:16.047 --> 16:18.313
My parents are about to drink
Alex and Harper's blood.

16:18.347 --> 16:19.480
- Oh!
- What?

16:19.781 --> 16:22.683
Thank you. Someone who
understands danger.

16:22.718 --> 16:24.718
OK, now that they know that,

16:24.753 --> 16:26.720
can we get back to
talking about us?

16:26.754 --> 16:29.021
We'll talk about it
on the way. Come on.

16:29.055 --> 16:31.356
Did the satellite guy come?

16:31.390 --> 16:34.726
I gotta tell him where
to put the dish.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.794
Max, we are in the middle
of something, here.

16:37.095 --> 16:39.296
Your sister and Harper are
about to be bitten by vampires.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.631
Cool! That's even better
than the satellite.

16:41.666 --> 16:43.466
Come on. Let's get over there.

16:43.501 --> 16:47.637
Oh, my gosh. What if we
only have time to save one?

16:47.671 --> 16:49.739
Alex is our daughter.

16:49.773 --> 16:53.275
But Harper has so
much more potential.

16:53.309 --> 16:55.143
We both know it'd be Harper

16:55.178 --> 16:56.945
who'd take care of
us in our old age.

16:58.414 --> 16:59.747
We'll talk about it on our way.

17:03.919 --> 17:05.819
All right...

17:05.855 --> 17:07.588
Since it's between rushes,

17:07.690 --> 17:11.459
why don't we take your
photos for your company IDs.

17:11.492 --> 17:14.127
But there's only two employees.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.763
It's a state law thing.
Just take a picture, will ya?

17:18.067 --> 17:21.167
I'm sorry. I'm just a tad hungry,
that's all.

17:21.203 --> 17:24.003
Alex, you first. Mmm?

17:25.339 --> 17:27.906
OK, good.

17:29.209 --> 17:31.043
Just tilt your head a little.

17:31.077 --> 17:32.777
[man] More.

17:33.746 --> 17:35.480
More...

17:35.514 --> 17:37.215
[growling] More.

17:38.417 --> 17:40.717
Uh... This is a
little uncomfortable.

17:40.752 --> 17:42.819
But it makes for a good picture.

17:42.853 --> 17:47.589
Chin out. Chin out.
Really stretch it.

17:47.624 --> 17:49.524
Now, Cindy, why don't
you go over there

17:49.559 --> 17:51.192
and help her with
her head position?

17:51.227 --> 17:53.094
But it's Alex's employee ID.

17:53.128 --> 17:55.129
Oh, relax. Cindy's a vampire.

17:55.163 --> 17:57.064
She's not going to show up
in the picture. [chuckles]

17:57.098 --> 17:59.065
Come on, Cindy.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.601
Actually, I didn't
know I was going first.

18:01.635 --> 18:05.471
I thought I was "
taking a picture" with, uh...

18:06.673 --> 18:08.573
...hmmm, Harper. [chuckles]

18:09.809 --> 18:12.110
Uh, Heh-heh. N-n-no,
I don't think we dided that.

18:12.144 --> 18:15.279
Yes, we did. You were going
to "take a picture" wh Alex,

18:15.314 --> 18:18.515
who is, frankly,
slightly more bitter.

18:18.549 --> 18:22.218
Would somebody take my picture?
I'm cramping up over here.

18:22.253 --> 18:25.454
- [muttering]
- All right, fine.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.357
Alex! Harper!

18:28.391 --> 18:29.958
What are you guys doing here?

18:30.260 --> 18:32.661
I'm in the middle of
getting my company ID.

18:33.796 --> 18:37.732
Juliet, I kind of fibbed
about me and Justin.

18:37.766 --> 18:39.466
- You know what? That can wait.
- Why?

18:39.834 --> 18:41.568
Because those vampires are
about to suck your blood.

18:41.602 --> 18:42.803
What?!

18:42.937 --> 18:46.473
You're right, we can
just talk about it later.

18:46.507 --> 18:47.974
Is this true, Cindy?

18:48.009 --> 18:50.577
Yeah well, kind of, I mean...

18:50.611 --> 18:53.213
It's not so bad.
It's just like a mosquito bite.

18:53.247 --> 18:56.082
And then all your blood is gone.

18:56.116 --> 18:58.751
Mom, Dad, you said you weren't
gonna do this anymore.

18:58.786 --> 19:00.453
Are we gonna have to move again?

19:00.487 --> 19:01.788
I know this embarrasses you,

19:02.323 --> 19:04.857
but unfortunately, it's who we are.
We're vampires.

19:04.892 --> 19:07.660
We can't all have the incredible
self-control that you have.

19:07.695 --> 19:10.363
Wait a minute. So you two were
planning this the whole time?

19:10.398 --> 19:11.931
Unbelievable.

19:11.966 --> 19:15.768
Well, maybe this goes
without saying, but I quit.

19:17.371 --> 19:22.374
I, uh, kinda need the job,
so I'm gonna take my chances.

19:22.409 --> 19:24.042
You know what?

19:24.077 --> 19:26.711
I haven't eaten anything in the
six months we've been here.

19:26.746 --> 19:29.381
And maybe opening a sandwich
shop four doors down

19:29.415 --> 19:31.650
from another sandwich shop
wasn't such a good idea,

19:31.684 --> 19:35.553
so I'm cool with drinking some
blood and movin' to Phoenix.

19:35.588 --> 19:37.555
- [pipe clanks]
- Mom?

19:37.590 --> 19:39.190
- [pipe clanks]
- [Alex] Dad?

19:39.225 --> 19:43.061
Harper! Oh, we've come to save you

19:43.963 --> 19:45.163
What about me?

19:45.264 --> 19:48.900
You guys. We're here
to save you guys.

19:49.668 --> 19:51.502
- [pipe clanks]
- Max!

19:53.739 --> 19:55.807
Did they bite her? Did I miss it?

19:55.841 --> 19:57.608
Who is that boy?

19:57.642 --> 20:00.377
[whimpering] Get him away from us!

20:00.412 --> 20:01.979
What's going on?

20:02.014 --> 20:03.581
It's like they're afraid
of Max or something.

20:04.015 --> 20:06.616
No, it's not Max,
it's his smell. [gagging]

20:06.651 --> 20:07.917
[chuckles] Believe it or not,

20:08.386 --> 20:10.253
this isn't even one
of his worst days.

20:10.287 --> 20:14.056
No, it's the pumpkin.
Vampires hate pumpkin.

20:14.091 --> 20:17.095
More than garlic. That's why
people originally put...

20:17.129 --> 20:19.565
...pumpkins outside their
house on Halloween,

20:19.599 --> 20:21.166
to keep away the vampires.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.001
Please make it stop!

20:23.036 --> 20:27.706
Just get that awful,
awful boy away from us!

20:27.741 --> 20:30.342
Not until you...

20:30.376 --> 20:33.812
Not until you apologize for
almost biting my daughter's neck

20:33.847 --> 20:36.749
and turning her into a
vampire for all eternity.

20:36.783 --> 20:39.118
All right, all right. We're sorry.

20:39.152 --> 20:42.554
What if we smooth it over with
a little bit of ice cream?

20:42.589 --> 20:46.625
Really? You were just about to
turn our daughter into a vampire

20:46.659 --> 20:49.995
and you think you can just
smooth it over with ice cream?

20:50.029 --> 20:51.630
So you don't want the ice cream?

20:51.798 --> 20:53.698
- No, we want the ice cream.
- Jerry!

20:53.732 --> 20:58.934
Um... and I think we
need more of an apology.

21:00.403 --> 21:02.036
Unlimited toppings?

21:02.071 --> 21:04.739
I accept your apology.
I'll take mine in a cup.

21:06.341 --> 21:08.776
Dad, they were just about
to drink our blood.

21:08.810 --> 21:11.712
That's right. This is unacceptable.

21:11.746 --> 21:15.582
Harper was gonna be the one to
take care of us in our old age.

21:15.616 --> 21:17.450
[whispering] Yes!

21:18.886 --> 21:21.554
Alright. I'll make dinner, too.

21:21.588 --> 21:23.889
Who's up for some
really rare steaks?

21:27.093 --> 21:30.261
Hey, Pumpkin Boy.
[whistles] Go take a shower.

21:30.295 --> 21:33.163
And hurry back if you want a steak.

21:33.197 --> 21:35.232
OK, listen guys,
we start out with salad.

21:35.266 --> 21:37.867
No butter, no fries,
and water instead of soda.

21:37.901 --> 21:40.570
Would somebody bite her?

21:47.823 --> 21:49.757
You're totally
checking out my neck.

21:49.792 --> 21:52.694
No, I'm not. I had a big breakfast.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.330
- You are so cute.
- No, you are.

21:55.364 --> 21:56.898
Nose kiss!

21:58.935 --> 22:02.070
Ugh. We are trying to enjoy

22:02.104 --> 22:05.640
about a ton of pumpkin
pie over here, people.

22:07.877 --> 22:10.078
You know, we're gonna have
to eat this whole thing,

22:10.113 --> 22:12.013
because it's not gonna
fit in the fridge.

22:13.348 --> 22:15.715
Can you hand me that big spoon?

22:17.383 --> 22:18.883
Jerry, that's a shovel.

22:19.652 --> 22:22.886
I know what it's called.
