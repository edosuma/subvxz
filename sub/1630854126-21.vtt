WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:05.135
Okay, and then,
if I did this right,

00:05.135 --> 00:07.007
under this cup should be...

00:09.574 --> 00:12.838
Damn, America
does have talent.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.492
Well, this is light work
compared to the real alchemy,

00:14.492 --> 00:16.407
Black girl magic.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.018
Boo.
Shut up and do another trick.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.498
Melissa, girl, get in here.

00:20.498 --> 00:21.673
Jacob doing magic.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.240
And now,

00:23.240 --> 00:26.026
the unbreakable rings
are apart.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.681
You're holding the rings
where the gap is.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.988
- Um, no.
- Yeah.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.859
Is that all you got,
the cheap hand gimmicks?

00:33.859 --> 00:35.905
I've seen better
at the boardwalk.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.472
I've seen a lot
at the boardwalk.

00:37.472 --> 00:38.821
Okay, how about this?

00:38.821 --> 00:40.431
Pick a card, any card.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.519
Remember it.

00:41.519 --> 00:42.912
Don't show it to me.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.740
And then put it back.

00:46.481 --> 00:49.266
Was your card
the five of hearts?

00:49.266 --> 00:50.659
No.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.487
Are you sure it wasn't
the five of hearts?

00:52.487 --> 00:54.532
The magic doesn't work
if you lie, Melissa.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.491
I'm not lying.
It was a queen of hearts.

00:56.491 --> 00:57.796
This is a racket.

01:01.626 --> 01:05.195
The amazing Jacob
has done it again.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.385
Memorial Day weekend
cannot come fast enough.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.908
I need three full days
to help Zach

01:22.908 --> 01:25.737
clean out his shoe closet,
AKA our entire apartment.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.826
I am drowning in swooshes.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.872
Gerald and I are going
to South Jazz Cafe

01:29.872 --> 01:33.702
to hear a little...

01:33.702 --> 01:35.443
No days off for me.

01:35.443 --> 01:36.748
I'm meeting up with some
of my fellow doomsday preppers

01:36.748 --> 01:38.446
to assemble hurricane kits.

01:38.446 --> 01:39.403
Oh, yeah, what's in the kit?

01:39.403 --> 01:40.752
Two types of rum

01:40.752 --> 01:42.363
and an assortment
of island flavors.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.799
- Yes.
- All right.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.540
Long weekends
just delay the inevitable.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.063
It's still a Monday,
even if it's

01:47.063 --> 01:48.934
masquerading as a Tuesday.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.980
Well, I, for one, can't wait

01:50.980 --> 01:53.591
because I'm going
on a girl trip.

01:53.591 --> 01:54.766
You mean girls' trip?

01:54.766 --> 01:56.681
No, girl trip, singular.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.988
I saved enough money
to take myself to Ocean City.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.120
Jersey?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.164
Maryland.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.340
all: Ooh.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.429
So you're going
on a trip by yourself?

02:05.429 --> 02:08.084
Yep, just me and the stamps
on my passport...

02:08.084 --> 02:10.304
metaphorically.
I don't have one of those.

02:10.304 --> 02:12.132
And before you start making fun

02:12.132 --> 02:14.308
of sad, little,
no-friends Janine--

02:14.308 --> 02:16.092
It's wonderful, sweetheart.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.659
Yeah, Janine,
don't make fun of yourself.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.356
It makes it less fun
for me when I do it.

02:19.356 --> 02:21.358
Okay, solo vacation.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.273
Hey, only solo vacation
I ever took

02:23.273 --> 02:24.796
was when they sequestered
the jury I was on.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.494
So good for you.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.365
Okay, the support
is supporting.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.758
I feel like I really need this.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.020
Go ahead, tell them

02:31.020 --> 02:32.587
what's on the
independence docket.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.763
Okay, so I'm going
to the Princess Royale,

02:34.763 --> 02:36.112
which is a three-star hotel.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.809
But it has
the confidence of four.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.202
I only stay
at five-star hotels.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.335
They become a six
when I walk in.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.424
And I'm thinking
about booking a massage.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.817
I can afford
either 20 minutes of a Swedish

02:45.817 --> 02:47.776
or 10 minutes of deep tissue.

02:47.776 --> 02:51.736
My advice: always go
for quality over quantity.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.129
Okay.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.478
This is a big step, Janine,

02:54.478 --> 02:56.654
and I am proud of you.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.003
Thank you, Barbara.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.396
<i>I love the company of others,</i>

02:59.396 --> 03:01.311
but I'm trying
to like my own company.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.704
Wanna see my room?

03:02.704 --> 03:04.140
Okay.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.099
That's weird.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.972
I have a missed call
from my mom.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.539
I'll just call her back.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.975
It's probably a butt dial
or something.

03:12.975 --> 03:16.283
Anyway, look at that view.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.762
That's the ocean.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.851
It's ocean view.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.462
G-Man, need help?

03:21.462 --> 03:22.898
I'm like a human Command-F.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.291
I can find anything.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.379
Yeah, have you seen
the sliced almonds

03:25.379 --> 03:27.250
for my otherwise plain oatmeal?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.425
We are out.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.861
But my girl Shanae
in the cafeteria

03:29.861 --> 03:31.123
has got a secret stash.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.647
We're very close.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.739
Shanae...

03:37.739 --> 03:39.654
How is
this Earth Day treating you?

03:39.654 --> 03:41.960
Do I look like I have time
to talk right now?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.223
Talk right now?

03:44.572 --> 03:47.575
Talk, talk right now?

03:47.575 --> 03:49.838
both: ♪ Talk right now,
talk, talk right now ♪

03:49.838 --> 03:51.883
♪ Talk right now,
talk, talk right now ♪

03:51.883 --> 03:54.103
Where have you been?

03:54.103 --> 03:56.236
I barely saw
your cute self last week.

03:56.236 --> 04:00.065
Ugh, I know, PSSA prep has
got me busier than Philips.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.980
Now, I told you about
them Caucasian references.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.895
You did.
You did.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.245
Hey, how was the move?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.811
Are you loving the new place?

04:06.811 --> 04:09.074
We're still in boxes.
I haven't gotten my bed yet.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.641
But I got Xfinity set up,

04:10.641 --> 04:12.339
and it is definitely
an upgrade.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.862
Well, if you still
need furniture recs,

04:13.862 --> 04:16.517
it would be my pleasure
to assist your lounging.

04:16.517 --> 04:17.648
Absolutely.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.041
And thank you very much.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.782
What can I get you
from the kitchen, boo?

04:20.782 --> 04:22.218
Boo?

04:22.218 --> 04:25.047
Yes, if you could spare
some accoutrement

04:25.047 --> 04:27.789
of the sliced almond variety
for my pal Gregory here.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.446
Please.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.143
Mm-hmm.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.492
What time is it?

04:35.492 --> 04:37.712
It is 7:09.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.714
We stopped serving almonds
at 7:08.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.109
Ha-ha.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.372
Ha?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.852
Shanae...

04:47.852 --> 04:49.376
You have got
to be kidding me.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.424
And then after lunch,

04:54.424 --> 04:56.600
we will hit the gym for today's
Earth Day activities.

04:56.600 --> 05:01.344
But first, recess and--

05:01.344 --> 05:03.085
list--listen.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.173
Do you hear that?

05:06.044 --> 05:08.003
Shh.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.961
Shush it.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.921
Ms. Teagues, who's that?

05:15.402 --> 05:16.403
Mom.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.839
That's my baby.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.188
What's up, my baby's babies?

05:20.929 --> 05:22.365
I hope y'all know

05:22.365 --> 05:23.584
y'all got the greatest teacher
in the world.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.194
You want to know how I know?

05:25.194 --> 05:26.848
Because she learned
from the best.

05:26.848 --> 05:27.979
- Mr. Rogers?
- Me.

05:27.979 --> 05:29.546
- Oh.
- Hi, Ms. Grandma Teagues.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.069
Boy--

05:31.069 --> 05:35.509
I mean, oh,
I'm nobody's granny, baby.

05:35.509 --> 05:38.033
Just call me Auntie Vanetta.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.208
That doesn't make sense.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.949
Mom.
Hey, Mom.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.777
What are you doing here?

05:42.777 --> 05:44.213
I saw you called,
and I tried to call you back.

05:44.213 --> 05:45.823
So...

05:45.823 --> 05:48.043
Well, when you didn't answer,
I got so worried,

05:48.043 --> 05:49.610
so I had to come
and check on you.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.960
We haven't spoken
in, like, six months.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.396
How did you even get in?

05:53.396 --> 05:54.571
'Cause you don't have
a visitor's badge.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.268
Oh, VIPs don't
need badges, baby.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.444
We need refreshments.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.141
I'm thirsty.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.578
All right, guys,
have fun at recess, okay?

06:01.578 --> 06:03.232
Be safe.
Hey, Mom, Mom, Mom?

06:03.232 --> 06:04.581
Yes?

06:04.581 --> 06:06.366
Um, I'm gonna get you
checked in.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.542
Okay.
Well, y'all kids behave now.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.719
This is so unexpected.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.156
I mean, I've invited my mom
to come here a lot of times--

06:14.156 --> 06:15.462
not today.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.724
But that's my mom.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.769
She plays by her own rules.

06:18.769 --> 06:21.293
Made it frustrating
to play Uno growing up,

06:21.293 --> 06:23.905
but anyway,
I'm really happy she's here.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.430
Hey, Gregory.

06:27.430 --> 06:30.781
Hey.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.609
Yeah, so there was
a real tension

06:32.609 --> 06:34.176
between you and Shanae
this morning,

06:34.176 --> 06:35.786
and--correct me if I'm wrong--

06:35.786 --> 06:38.354
it didn't feel
like the good kind.

06:38.354 --> 06:41.226
- Yeah, I mean, it's whatever.
- Mm-hmm.

06:41.226 --> 06:42.402
When you say "It's whatever,"

06:42.402 --> 06:43.838
do you mean,
"Don't worry, Jacob,

06:43.838 --> 06:45.535
"I have a foolproof plan
to win her over,

06:45.535 --> 06:47.842
thus removing this new stress
from your life"?

06:47.842 --> 06:49.626
No, I do not.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.149
I'm just going to go back
to avoiding her

06:51.149 --> 06:53.717
and never asking her
for anything.

06:53.717 --> 06:56.590
Hearing you,
not loving what I'm hearing.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.287
Look man, it's not
that big of a deal.

06:58.287 --> 07:00.158
I don't need to talk to every
single person at this school.

07:00.158 --> 07:02.726
That's pretty strong words
for a wannabe principal.

07:02.726 --> 07:05.425
What does small talk
have to do with leadership?

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
Look, you don't have to be
best friends with everybody,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.037
but it doesn't hurt to be able
to shoot the breeze.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.560
Don't you watch late night TV?

07:10.560 --> 07:11.518
I'm not a celebrity.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.910
Yet.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.129
Hey, it's easy, look.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.914
Hey, teal sweater, yeah.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.176
And see, I'm lying.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.308
That sweater is hideous.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.620
And oh, that light
right there, I fixed that,

07:26.620 --> 07:28.186
depending on who you ask.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.666
I know you didn't climb
up on a ladder.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.798
I did.

07:30.798 --> 07:31.973
I climbed up on two, in fact.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.017
Oh.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.847
Oh, hey, Barbara, Ava,

07:36.847 --> 07:38.283
I'd like you to meet
my mom, Vanetta.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.634
Oh, wonderful to meet you.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.157
I've heard so much about you.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.941
- You must be...
- Oh, that's...

07:43.941 --> 07:45.856
I'm Barbara Howard.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.771
I teach kindergarten.
- Yes.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.469
Damn, genetics are wild.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.818
You're cool and she...

07:53.298 --> 07:54.561
You would beat my ass,
wouldn't you?

07:54.561 --> 07:56.954
Hmm.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.434
<i>The key to never
getting your ass beat?</i>

07:58.434 --> 08:00.654
Knowing when someone
can beat your ass.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.612
What brings you to Abbott?

08:02.612 --> 08:05.485
Well, I just thought I'd stop
in and check on my baby girl.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.443
I was in the neighborhood.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.531
You live in the neighborhood.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.490
Oh, girl, stop being silly.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.274
Come and give your mama
some love.

08:12.274 --> 08:13.841
She's so sensitive.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.408
Well, enjoy your visit.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.409
Thank you.

08:17.409 --> 08:18.976
You're welcome.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.978
See you, Barbara.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.066
Ain't nobody around here

08:22.066 --> 08:23.459
giving you no problems,
are they?

08:23.459 --> 08:25.417
No, no, no, no, no,
everyone is great.

08:25.417 --> 08:26.941
There was this one parent
last week,

08:26.941 --> 08:28.812
but, you know,
I got through that.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.336
Period.

08:31.336 --> 08:34.514
I am actually taking
a trip to Ocean City to unwind.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.515
- Oh, Princess Royale.
- Yes.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.559
- Yes.
- Yes.

08:36.559 --> 08:37.995
Oh, man, you remember.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.083
I've wanted to go there
ever since I was little.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.868
So I'm excited.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.260
You know, me and my girls
used to go there all the time.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.392
It was cute.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.915
Room was
a little stuffy, though.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.048
Yeah, well, I think
it looks nice.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.790
Well, how are you?

08:49.790 --> 08:52.096
Oh, I am doing good,
baby girl.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.664
I got this new job.

08:54.664 --> 08:56.623
Mom, you got a new job?

08:56.623 --> 08:57.841
Yes.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.321
And it's work from home,

08:59.321 --> 09:00.496
which is perfect for me,
because what I look like,

09:00.496 --> 09:02.411
going into an office?

09:02.411 --> 09:04.065
Oh, man, that is great.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.501
Yes, it is.

09:05.501 --> 09:08.069
You know, but I do got
this thing going on

09:08.069 --> 09:09.810
with my phone.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.681
But anyway, the hours
are great on the job.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.249
So everything is going great.

09:14.249 --> 09:17.165
Well, what's going on
with your phone?

09:17.165 --> 09:19.515
I shouldn't have
even mentioned it.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.952
Oh, just something
about me going over my data

09:21.952 --> 09:23.693
and them threatening
to turn the phone off.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.478
But it's only $639.17.

09:26.478 --> 09:29.133
But I'll figure it out.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.700
Mom, they can't turn
your phone off.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.701
You need your phone.

09:31.701 --> 09:32.833
No, I know.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.748
But it is what it is, right?

09:34.748 --> 09:38.708
Mom, did you just come here
because you need money?

09:38.708 --> 09:41.929
Janine, no.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.584
Why would you even think that?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.673
I came 'cause I wanted
to see you do your thing.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.283
I'm proud of you, baby.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.241
Mm-hmm.

09:50.241 --> 09:53.636
Well, I love you, Mom.

09:53.636 --> 09:54.811
I'm so glad you're here.

09:54.811 --> 09:55.899
Me
too. You know what?

09:55.899 --> 09:56.987
Let's take a picture.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.423
- Okay.
- Capture this moment.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.729
Come here.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.601
Look at you, looking
just like me.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.211
Cheese.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.213
Okay, let me send this to--

10:05.213 --> 10:08.042
whoa, oh, hell, look
like they shut my phone off.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.521
But don't you worry about it.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.402
Hey, Barbara, hey, work mom.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.099
I was wondering
if you could watch

10:22.099 --> 10:25.625
my class for a little bit
while I go check on my mom mom.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.365
Not a problem.

10:27.365 --> 10:28.758
You know, it's lovely
being able to put

10:28.758 --> 10:30.368
a face to the name,

10:30.368 --> 10:32.719
though this isn't
your typical school visit

10:32.719 --> 10:34.068
from a parent.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.070
Yeah, well, that's my mom.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.420
She loves surprises
and hide and seek.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.465
She's really good at that.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.076
This is her first visit
to Abbott, isn't it?

10:42.076 --> 10:43.730
Yeah, yeah.

10:43.730 --> 10:47.298
She's so busy with the, um,
stuff that she does, so...

10:47.298 --> 10:49.736
Well, I know that it hasn't
always been easy with her.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.868
But it's nice she made it.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.044
Right, yeah.
And she's doing so well.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.656
She has this new job that
she loves, which is amazing.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.135
It's no complaints, really.

10:58.135 --> 11:01.748
Well, there was some drama
with her cell phone bill.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.228
Actually, her phone
just got turned off.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.708
Like, just now.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.188
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.450
- Just now?
- Yeah.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.234
On the day
she chose to visit?

11:10.234 --> 11:11.540
I can't believe it, either.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.759
But she isn't worried.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.151
I am, though.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.849
You know, it's her phone.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.242
And I do have that trip money.

11:18.242 --> 11:21.028
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.986
I'm honestly just, like,
really glad she's here.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.161
So, yeah.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.642
Well, thank you.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.078
Nice work, kids.

11:28.078 --> 11:28.992
Keep track
of that glitter, though.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.515
It is not biodegradable.

11:30.515 --> 11:33.388
Neither is any
of that Styrofoam.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.826
Nurse Makiah, we on fi-yah.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.484
Shanae, get me one
of those cookies.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.920
That's your new recipe, right?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.792
Yeah, went to Aldi
instead of Acme.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.097
Okay.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.446
If I didn't love
Shanae so much,

11:48.446 --> 11:50.448
I would be jealous
of her cookie success.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.015
Ava really knows
how to work a room.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.586
I can also work a room.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.632
Watch me.

12:00.632 --> 12:04.071
Nurse Makiah.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.376
Hello.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.161
Did you need something?

12:07.161 --> 12:10.294
No, no, I'm just
shooting the breeze.

12:10.294 --> 12:11.948
You know, speaking of breeze,

12:11.948 --> 12:12.993
how do you feel
about pollution?

12:12.993 --> 12:14.081
Bad?

12:14.081 --> 12:15.647
Mm-hmm, yes, same here.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.650
So we have that in common.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.087
Yeah, cool.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.479
Do you have any other opinions?

12:25.919 --> 12:27.659
I just figured out where
I know Janine's mom from:

12:27.659 --> 12:29.096
the club.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.488
We danced on the same tables.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.490
Cool people
should have cool babies.

12:32.490 --> 12:33.927
It's not right what happened
to that woman.

12:37.191 --> 12:40.977
I don't like this one bit,
dropping in out of the blue,

12:40.977 --> 12:44.676
dancing on the same furniture
as Ava.

12:44.676 --> 12:47.679
Oh, I got a bad feeling.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.594
And then a mother wants to drop
that little tidbit

12:49.594 --> 12:51.988
about being late
on her phone bill.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.425
It's a convenient time
to visit.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.079
Yeah, well,
I smelled swindler

12:56.079 --> 12:57.820
the minute she walked in.

12:57.820 --> 13:01.693
That and, like,
a spicy, citrusy aroma.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.783
She smelled
really good, actually.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.135
Barbara, listen,
nothing good ever came

13:08.135 --> 13:10.528
from getting messed up
in another family's business.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.660
All right?

13:11.660 --> 13:12.922
Unless you're on Yelp

13:12.922 --> 13:15.403
and they're your competition.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.274
I know you're right.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.624
But Janine has this trip
coming up,

13:19.624 --> 13:21.801
and it's a big deal for her.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.760
And I just think her mother
is here to get that money.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.718
- Oh.
- Damn, that's cold.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.372
Thank you, Ava.

13:28.372 --> 13:30.113
Note to self,
new way to manipulate:

13:30.113 --> 13:31.811
step one, have a daughter.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.421
Step two, play the long game.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.349
Feeling under the weather?

13:48.349 --> 13:50.133
It's cold and flu season somewhere.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.440
Well, I'm sure that's true.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.138
Lovely of you to come by
and see Janine at work.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.792
It meant so much to her.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.663
She talks about you
all the time.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.971
Can you believe she's
never invited me here before?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.190
I really can't.

14:05.496 --> 14:06.933
You've raised
a wonderful daughter.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.891
I hope you're extremely proud.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.458
I am.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.503
You know, she's a Penn grad.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.636
Her sister,
on the other hand...

14:14.636 --> 14:17.987
well, you win some,
you lose some.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.989
I have had the great pleasure
of watching

14:19.989 --> 14:21.817
Janine grow so much.

14:21.817 --> 14:25.168
I mean, this year alone,
working for her students

14:25.168 --> 14:28.432
and on herself, building up
the confidence and the money

14:28.432 --> 14:31.392
to treat herself
to a much-needed vacation.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.784
Mm-hmm.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.003
I'm worried
because she mentioned

14:34.003 --> 14:36.310
a bill situation of yours.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.268
- That's personal.
- Yes, but I'm worried

14:38.268 --> 14:39.487
that she's rethinking
her travel

14:39.487 --> 14:40.923
in order to help you out.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.229
Help me out?

14:42.229 --> 14:44.231
I would never ask her
to do that.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.102
That's what she's
going to do anyway.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.843
So I just thought
that you should know.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.845
You know,
I'm sure my daughter

14:49.845 --> 14:51.891
will do what's right.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.631
Besides, her and Tariq
splitting her rent,

14:53.631 --> 14:55.546
it ain't like she's struggling.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.287
That young man is
no longer with your daughter.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.550
What?

14:59.550 --> 15:04.991
Damn, well, guess you
can't keep a good man down.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.906
I just want you to know
how important

15:06.906 --> 15:09.169
this vacation is for Janine--

15:09.169 --> 15:13.390
Uh, Barbara, you know,
this is a family matter.

15:13.390 --> 15:16.263
And I don't remember seeing you
at any of the cookouts.

15:17.438 --> 15:18.700
You don't know me.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.532
You're right,
I don't know you.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.665
But I know your daughter.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.668
And she will help you out
at her own expense.

15:30.668 --> 15:31.974
Yeah, well, I'm her mother,

15:31.974 --> 15:34.498
and I brought her
into this world at mine.

15:36.718 --> 15:39.112
Why don't I give you
the money for the bill,

15:39.112 --> 15:41.549
you tell Janine
that you worked it out,

15:41.549 --> 15:44.944
and we keep it between us,
just you and I?

15:56.999 --> 15:57.913
- Janine--
- Baby--

15:57.913 --> 15:59.306
Hey, Mom,

15:59.306 --> 16:01.351
why don't we go
to my classroom?

16:01.351 --> 16:02.483
Sure.

16:02.483 --> 16:03.745
Hmm.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.316
Come on, baby.

16:11.622 --> 16:14.103
Yeah, you too good
for this place, baby.

16:14.103 --> 16:17.150
That lady--I mean, is that
who's teaching our youth,

16:17.150 --> 16:20.457
nosy-ass,
judgy-ass over-steppers?

16:20.457 --> 16:21.850
I mean, that's crazy.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.200
Because I'm down there,
minding my own business,

16:24.200 --> 16:25.985
and then she go
calling bitches broke.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.769
And I'm like, "Excuse me?"

16:27.769 --> 16:29.727
Yeah, see, see,
you only caught the tail end.

16:29.727 --> 16:30.685
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, she like,

16:30.685 --> 16:33.035
"You broke and deadbeat."

16:33.035 --> 16:35.646
And I'm like, "How can
a mother be deadbeat?"

16:35.646 --> 16:37.474
I carried you in my body.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.825
Ugh.
Anyway, then she squared up.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.436
Barbara Howard squared up?

16:42.436 --> 16:43.915
She sure did, talking
about she from North Philly.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.178
I said so, I'm from West.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.222
What's good?
- Hmm.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.702
Then she gonna switch it up

16:47.702 --> 16:49.921
and try to give me a handout.
- Hmm.

16:49.921 --> 16:50.879
Something ain't right
with her.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.185
Mm.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.015
Mom, why did you come here?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.408
I already told you,
I miss you.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.454
Right, but I've been calling
you for months.

17:00.454 --> 17:01.977
You know, you could
have just answered.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.068
Well, I was busy.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.896
And you ain't leave
no messages.

17:09.854 --> 17:12.901
All right, so here's
what we're gonna do.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.642
I'm gonna call
the phone company

17:14.642 --> 17:17.297
and set up
a payment plan for you.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.821
That way, they'll turn
your phone back on.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.215
And then I'm going
to give you the money

17:22.215 --> 17:25.305
for the first two payments,
but that is it.

17:25.305 --> 17:28.351
I don't have the rest
of the money to spare.

17:28.351 --> 17:31.311
I'm going on vacation.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.269
And that is what I can do
for you right now, Mom.

17:33.269 --> 17:37.578
It's that option,
or you're on your own.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.797
And it's totally up to you.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.843
Well, I was gonna figure
it out...

17:44.454 --> 17:46.239
But I'll take option one.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.023
Okay.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.285
Thank you, baby.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.113
You're welcome.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.158
I love you, Mom.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.420
And you need your phone.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.074
Yeah, I do, for work.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.165
And I love you too.

18:01.428 --> 18:02.994
Come here, my baby.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.652
I still don't see what's
so good about this place.

18:08.652 --> 18:09.740
Mom.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.095
<i>You know, some things
can't be taught.</i>

18:16.095 --> 18:18.662
I'm bad at small talk.

18:18.662 --> 18:23.276
I'm just gonna stick
with regular talk.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.669
Now, what are
you up to tonight, Shanae?

18:25.669 --> 18:27.454
Ugh, more unpacking.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.282
We were at it
so late last night,

18:29.282 --> 18:31.066
I missed the Orioles game.
- Oh.

18:31.066 --> 18:32.415
And today's been so crazy.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.678
I haven't had a chance
to check the score.

18:34.678 --> 18:37.812
Uh, 5-3 O's.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.249
Adley Rutschman hit an
opposite field walk off homer.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.946
And Cedric Mullins was
a single shy of the cycle.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.600
Mullins is my guy.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.949
All these young dudes--

18:44.949 --> 18:47.691
Cedric, Mullen, Felix, Logan.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.563
And they say we're living
in another dead ball era.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.955
Oh, please.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.783
It's simple, just hit dingers,

18:52.783 --> 18:54.698
play defense, close games.

18:54.698 --> 18:55.830
Exactly.
But that's always baseball.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.092
You just show up
every day, just like...

18:57.092 --> 18:59.877
both: Cal Ripken, Jr.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.532
Oh, you've been
an Orioles fan this whole time

19:02.532 --> 19:03.794
and never said a word.

19:03.794 --> 19:04.839
Wow.

19:04.839 --> 19:05.840
Well, now I know.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.234
Yes, you do.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.497
Okay, Gregory.

19:10.497 --> 19:13.282
Connection--
it's a lot like baseball,

19:13.282 --> 19:15.241
a bunch of weird,
kind of boring stuff happens,

19:15.241 --> 19:18.244
and then boom, home run.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.593
Who knew?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.336
Oh, Janine.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.207
I know I crossed the line,

19:25.207 --> 19:27.166
and please,
allow me to apologize.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.298
No, Barbara, it's okay.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.344
Really, I'm not mad.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.869
If anything, it is moving
that you care that much

19:34.869 --> 19:37.001
that you would do that for me.

19:37.001 --> 19:40.614
So I think
I'm just embarrassed.

19:40.614 --> 19:44.270
Look, my mom--

19:44.270 --> 19:46.489
I love my mom.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.752
But that's my mom.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.058
So how'd it go?

19:50.058 --> 19:52.234
It went okay.
I handled it.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.280
Her phone's gonna get
turned back on.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.411
But don't worry.

19:55.411 --> 19:56.499
We came to a compromise.

19:56.499 --> 19:57.805
I'm helping her where I can.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.589
So the trip is still on.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.851
Whew.

20:00.851 --> 20:01.896
Wonderful.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.332
You had me scared.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.768
Oh, I'm happy for you.

20:04.768 --> 20:05.856
Thank you.

20:05.856 --> 20:08.381
What about the massage?

20:08.381 --> 20:10.121
Massage money is
on its way to Mom.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.862
But it's all right.

20:11.862 --> 20:13.690
I'm happy I'm able to help.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.301
Next time.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.390
And now that I've set
that boundary, who knows?

20:17.390 --> 20:20.349
Maybe my mom and I
can get closer than ever,

20:20.349 --> 20:22.569
take our own little trip
one day as mother and daughter.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.399
Maybe.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.184
And when you're out there
by yourself,

20:29.184 --> 20:31.317
do not carry
too much cash on you.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.927
I won't.
I don't have any.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.624
Well, you should have some.

20:34.624 --> 20:35.930
But do you have
a swim cover-up?

20:37.410 --> 20:38.802
The Ross is having a sale.

20:38.802 --> 20:39.760
Wait, really?
Which one?

20:39.760 --> 20:41.283
Yes, on City Line.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.937
- I love that one.
- Girl, let me get my bag.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.112
Come on.
- Okay.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.598
Gregory, do you think

20:51.598 --> 20:53.991
I could bend this spoon
with magic?

20:53.991 --> 20:56.124
Jacob, when I told you
to get a hobby,

20:56.124 --> 20:58.561
I meant one
that wasn't annoying.

20:58.561 --> 20:59.649
Hey.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.477
Hey, how was your day?

21:02.696 --> 21:04.263
Weird, social.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.786
I talked to Shanae
about baseball.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.135
How was yours?

21:07.135 --> 21:08.919
Guys, look,
I think I'm doing it.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.486
Mine was also
weird, eventful.

21:10.486 --> 21:12.096
My mom was here.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.576
Oh, my God, guys.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.448
- You heading out?
- Yeah, you?

21:15.448 --> 21:17.450
No, but I'll walk with you.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.452
Guys, I'm Neo-ing.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.236
I'm the Matrix.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.285
<i>- Delicious.
- And a large popcorn.</i>
