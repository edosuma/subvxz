WEBVTT

00:07.440 --> 00:10.076
WHY DO YOU GO ON ?

00:10.143 --> 00:14.381
IF I CAN BRING ONE
HELL SPAWN BACK TO HUMANITY,

00:14.447 --> 00:16.082
I CAN REST.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.717
I DON'T
GIVE A DAMN !

00:18.852 --> 00:20.019
THE HELL SPAWN.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.755
I WANT YOU TO
SPARE HIS LIFE.

00:21.821 --> 00:23.556
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR HIM.

00:23.623 --> 00:26.459
THE PROPHECY HAS
ALREADY BEEN FULFILLED.

00:26.526 --> 00:30.864
THE SEED OF A HELL SPAWN
HAS BEEN PLANTED.

00:32.699 --> 00:36.536
AL, YOU THINK I STILL
WOULDN'T KNOW YOU ?

00:36.603 --> 00:39.939
I VISIT YOUR
GRAVE EVERY SUNDAY.

00:40.006 --> 00:42.675
THE AFTERLIFE IS NOT WHAT
THE GOOD BOOK SAYS, GRANNY.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.680
YOU'VE DONE
WELL, OFFICER.

00:47.747 --> 00:51.017
THE DEPARTMENT
IS PROUD OF YOU.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.318
OHH !

00:59.092 --> 01:01.428
YOU WERE SENT
TO KILL ME,

01:01.494 --> 01:03.997
WHY DID YOU
SAVE MY LIFE ?

01:07.734 --> 01:11.504
Captions made possible by
HOME BOX OFFICE

01:11.571 --> 01:15.842
A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

01:41.668 --> 01:42.869
NO !

01:51.778 --> 01:54.080
AHH !

02:05.558 --> 02:07.827
THEY SAY THAT THERE'S
A DEMON IN EVERY MAN

02:07.894 --> 02:10.129
AND A MAN
IN EVERY DEMON.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.565
NO ONE KNOWS THAT
BETTER THAN SPAWN.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.902
YET, HOW DOES HE REGAIN
EVEN SCRAPS OF HIS HUMANITY

02:15.969 --> 02:19.239
WHEN EVERYTHING'S
BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM ?

02:19.305 --> 02:23.476
HE HAS NO SOUL,
NO LOVE, NO FAMILY,

02:23.543 --> 02:25.912
NOT EVEN A FACE.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.882
BUT, HE STILL
HAS A HEART

02:28.948 --> 02:30.783
AND THOUGH
HE'S BLIND TO IT ALL,

02:30.850 --> 02:33.419
MAYBE, THERE'S HOPE
FOR HIM AFTER ALL.

02:56.843 --> 03:02.248
( Cogliostro )
THE HELL SPAWN STANDS
CLOSER TO HIS DESTINY.

03:02.315 --> 03:06.886
HE LIES CAUGHT
BETWEEN TWO FORCES,

03:06.953 --> 03:10.557
HEAVEN AND HELL.

03:10.623 --> 03:15.895
A PRISONER IN A SKIN
THAT IS NOT HIS OWN,

03:15.962 --> 03:18.097
WANTING TO BREAK FREE

03:18.164 --> 03:22.569
AND SMASH THROUGH
TO A NEW LIFE.

03:22.635 --> 03:27.273
HE FIGHTS AGAINST
THE ENEMY WITHIN,

03:27.340 --> 03:30.510
BUT HE WILL
SOON LEARN

03:30.577 --> 03:33.813
THAT THE IMPLACABLE
ENEMY OF HELL

03:33.880 --> 03:36.950
IS HEAVEN,

03:37.016 --> 03:40.486
AND THE ENEMY
WILL KEEP COMING.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.714
TWO MORE BOUNTY
HUNTERS IN THE ALLEY.

04:07.780 --> 04:11.117
DID YOU THINK
THE PORTAL ONLY
OPENS TO HELL ?

04:11.184 --> 04:13.620
HEAVEN HAS
ITS OWN KILLERS.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.589
THEY, TOO, ARE RELENTLESS
AND WITHOUT MERCY.

04:16.656 --> 04:20.059
WHAT KIND OF HEAVEN
SENDS BOUNTY HUNTERS ?

04:20.126 --> 04:22.695
WHO DO YOU THINK
THEY WOULD SEND ?

04:22.762 --> 04:26.265
A CARPENTER
WEARING SANDALS ?

04:26.332 --> 04:28.201
THEY INTEND
TO KILL ANYTHING

04:28.267 --> 04:30.103
WITH THE STINK
OF HELL ON IT.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.171
THEY'VE ALSO COME
BECAUSE OF THE PROPHECY.

04:32.238 --> 04:34.207
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, OLD MAN ?

04:34.273 --> 04:36.075
FOR THOUSANDS
OF YEARS

04:36.142 --> 04:37.910
HEAVEN HAS
HARVESTED SOULS

04:37.977 --> 04:39.946
FOR THE ARMY
OF LIGHT.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.849
THEIR METHODS ARE
NO DIFFERENT THAN HELL'S.

04:42.915 --> 04:47.820
IF YOU DO NOT
REGAIN YOUR HUMANITY,

04:47.887 --> 04:50.923
THERE WILL BE NO HOPE
FOR THE WOMAN

04:50.990 --> 04:52.358
YOU CLAIM TO PROTECT.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.193
I DON'T CLAIM,
OLD MAN.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.863
ANYTHING THAT HURTS
HER, I WILL KILL.

04:56.929 --> 05:00.066
YOUR PRIDE BLINDS YOU
TO THE TRUTH.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.668
YOU'VE BROUGHT
HER INTO VIEW

05:01.734 --> 05:03.803
OF BOTH HEAVEN
AND HELL.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.739
NOW SHE IS A PAWN
IN THE GAME.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.174
WHAT GAME ?

05:08.241 --> 05:10.009
IT IS THE PROPHECY !

05:10.076 --> 05:13.012
HELL SPAWN WOULD PLANT HIS
SEED IN A HUMAN WOMAN !

05:13.079 --> 05:14.881
A CHILD WOULD
BE BORN,

05:14.947 --> 05:20.086
AND THAT CHILD WOULD DECIDE
THE OUTCOME OF ARMAGEDDON !

05:20.153 --> 05:22.722
THE FINAL BATTLE
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL !

05:22.789 --> 05:25.224
NO, I DON'T
BELIEVE YOU !

05:25.291 --> 05:28.428
MALEBOLGIA HAS
TRICKED YOU AGAIN !

05:28.494 --> 05:30.563
IT ISN'T YOU
HE WANTS.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.398
IT'S THE CHILD !

05:34.801 --> 05:36.269
BURKE, GOT ANY LEADS

05:36.335 --> 05:37.704
ON THE GUY WHO
SHOT YOUR PARTNER ?

05:37.770 --> 05:39.672
I HEARD THE WACKO
WEARS A RED CAPE.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.711
HOW'S TWITCH
DOING, SAM ?

05:44.777 --> 05:46.612
WE'RE ALL REAL
CONCERNED ABOUT HIM.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.047
THE WORD
AROUND HERE

05:48.114 --> 05:50.083
IS THAT TWITCH'S
A LITTLE "TOUCHED"

05:50.149 --> 05:51.284
AFTER THE
SHOOTING.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.487
BEAT IT !

05:56.222 --> 05:58.524
HEY TWITCH,
HOW YOU DOIN', UH ?

05:58.591 --> 06:00.359
OKAY.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.328
YOU SAVED THE
BULLET, TWITCH ?

06:02.395 --> 06:04.864
THAT'S GOTTA BE YOUR
LUCKY BULLET, MAN.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.566
IT'S IN
A SAFE PLACE.

06:06.632 --> 06:09.702
JEEZ, FOR THE
LOVE OF CHRIST,

06:09.769 --> 06:11.104
YOU TELLING ME
YOU STILL GOT

06:11.170 --> 06:12.305
FUCKIN' LEAD
IN YOUR HEAD ?

06:12.371 --> 06:13.740
( Burke )
GET THE FUCK
OUTTA HERE !

06:13.806 --> 06:16.576
YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
AT A FUNERAL OR SOMETHING !

06:16.642 --> 06:18.644
HEY, SAM,
C'MON !

06:18.711 --> 06:20.646
YOU'VE BECOME A REGULAR
NURSEMAID, BURKE.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.015
I NEVER SEEN YOUR
FEMININE SIDE BEFORE.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.984
THANK YOU, SIR.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.919
ARE THE PIECES
COMING TOGETHER ?

06:26.986 --> 06:29.822
THE SHOOTING IS
STILL A BLUR, SIR.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.824
WHEN YOU PLAY
WITH MATCHES,

06:31.891 --> 06:34.527
YOU CAN
GET BURNED.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.697
HEY, PARTNER.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.298
YOU WENT AWAY
THERE, FOR AWHILE.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.033
THERE WAS
SOMETHING ELSE

06:41.100 --> 06:43.035
ABOUT THE MAN
IN THE RED CLOAK.

06:43.102 --> 06:44.837
HE HAD CLAWS.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.073
HEY, I DON'T CARE
IF THE GUY RUNS AROUND

06:47.140 --> 06:48.841
WEARING TIGHTS
AND A TIARA,

06:48.908 --> 06:50.309
I'M GONNA
NAIL HIS ASS.

06:50.376 --> 06:51.577
IT WASN'T HIM.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.179
TWITCH, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

06:53.246 --> 06:54.747
HE SHOT YOU IN THE HEAD,
I ALMOST LOST YOU, BUDDY.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.382
THE SHOOTER
PULLING THE TRIGGER

06:56.449 --> 06:58.751
DIDN'T HAVE
A CLAWED HAND.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.888
I REMEMBER LOOKING DOWN
THE BARREL OF A GUN.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.857
I CAN SEE
A MAN'S HAND.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.259
YOU CAN SEE
THE SHOOTER'S HAND,

07:06.325 --> 07:07.660
BUT NOT HIS FACE ?

07:07.727 --> 07:09.529
IT'S LIKE
HE WAS IN SHADOW.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.130
I WANTED IT TO BE
THE FREAK IN RED,

07:11.197 --> 07:13.132
BUT MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO THINK.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.135
THEY FOUND MY NOTEBOOK,
IT WAS ALL BLOODY.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.538
ON THE LAST PAGE,
I HAD WRITTEN THE NAME,

07:18.604 --> 07:20.106
JASON WYNN.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.074
IT MAKES SENSE NOW !

07:22.141 --> 07:23.943
YOUR MIND WON'T LET
YOU FINGER THE GUY

07:24.010 --> 07:25.678
BECAUSE THE PERSON
WHO SHOT YOU

07:25.745 --> 07:28.481
IS THE ONE PERSON YOU
WON'T LET BE THE SHOOTER.

07:28.548 --> 07:31.984
SOMEBODY YOU RESPECTED,
SOMEBODY YOU TRUSTED.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.821
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, SIR ?

07:34.887 --> 07:37.690
YEAH, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE CHIEF OF POLICE.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.492
WHY WOULD HE TRY
TO KILL ME ?

07:39.559 --> 07:41.027
BECAUSE YOU
KNOW SOMETHING.

07:41.093 --> 07:44.564
SIR, I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD SAY THIS

07:44.630 --> 07:47.533
OUT LOUD
TO ANYONE ELSE.

07:50.236 --> 07:52.972
SOMETHING SEEPED INTO
OUR LIVES, GRANNY,

07:53.039 --> 07:55.474
AND CHANGED THINGS.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.544
AT NIGHT, IN OUR BED,
I CAN HEAR TERRY BREATHING.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.714
I PRAY HE'S GONNA REACH
OVER AND TOUCH ME,

08:01.781 --> 08:03.115
PUT HIS ARMS
AROUND ME.

08:03.182 --> 08:05.184
BUT HE NEVER DOES.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.787
I THINK HE'S GONNA
LEAVE US, GRANNY.

08:07.854 --> 08:10.289
THAT MAN'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

08:10.356 --> 08:12.658
WITH THE BABY
ON THE WAY.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.427
YEAH...

08:14.493 --> 08:16.529
WANDA,
WHAT IS IT ?

08:16.596 --> 08:20.666
YOU DON'T SOUND TOO
HAPPY ABOUT THE BABY.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.603
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
HAPPENED WITH TERRY AND ME,

08:23.669 --> 08:26.706
I'M THINKING ABOUT HAVING
AN ABORTION, GRANNY.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.941
YOU CAN'T,
WANDA.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.843
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG, GRANNY,

08:30.910 --> 08:33.045
WITH THIS BABY
INSIDE ME...

08:35.581 --> 08:37.183
YOU LOOK
TIRED, GRANNY,

08:37.250 --> 08:38.885
WHY DON'T YOU
GET SOME REST ?

08:38.951 --> 08:40.953
I'M SORRY BUT I HAVE
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.357
THE BABY, IT'S NOT
TERRY'S, IS IT ?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.795
I'LL CALL
YOU LATER.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.565
IT'S STILL
GOD'S CHILD.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.471
( ticking )

09:02.308 --> 09:05.177
( groaning )

09:21.193 --> 09:23.763
HELP...

09:45.351 --> 09:47.320
YOU ASKED
TO SEE ME ?

09:48.988 --> 09:53.192
OUR DEPARTMENT IS UNDER
INVESTIGATION BY THE NSC.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.163
SULLIVAN'S THEIR
NEW DIRECTOR.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.265
I'VE READ
THE PAPERS.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.534
WE'VE GOT
A PROBLEM, SAM.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.502
IT SEEMS LIKE JASON WYNN
HAD ONE OF OUR COPS

10:03.569 --> 10:05.338
ON HIS PAYROLL.

10:05.404 --> 10:06.539
YOU DON'T SAY ?

10:06.605 --> 10:08.274
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW
THE PRESS HAS A WAY

10:08.341 --> 10:09.675
OF DISTORTING
THE TRUTH.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.177
US COPS HAVE
TO STICK TOGETHER.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.312
WE ALL SHOULD
BE CAREFUL ABOUT
WHAT WE SAY.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.614
YOU KNOW, YOU SEEM
A LITTLE WORRIED, CHIEF.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.516
WE'VE GOT
NOTHING TO HIDE...

10:17.583 --> 10:18.851
RIGHT ?

10:18.918 --> 10:20.653
YOU'RE PARTNER
IS THE ONE THAT
WORRIES ME,

10:20.720 --> 10:22.555
WHAT HE MIGHT SAY.

10:22.621 --> 10:24.623
HE HASN'T BEEN RIGHT
SINCE THE SHOOTING.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.292
TWITCH IS FINE.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.227
OUT OF RESPECT FOR
THE WOUNDS TWITCH
HAS SUFFERED,

10:28.294 --> 10:29.895
I'VE LEFT YOUR
PARTNER IN PLACE,

10:29.962 --> 10:31.097
TEMPORARILY,

10:31.163 --> 10:32.365
BUT AS A COP,
OFF THE RECORD,

10:32.431 --> 10:33.933
HE'S FINISHED.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.668
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

10:35.735 --> 10:37.103
HE'S SO FAR
FROM FINISHED...

10:37.169 --> 10:38.771
C'MON, BURKE,
HE HAS NO FUCKIN' MEMORY,

10:38.838 --> 10:40.406
YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW THAT.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.474
LISTEN TO ME,

10:41.540 --> 10:42.875
THERE MAY BE
LONG-TERM DAMAGE

10:42.942 --> 10:44.410
THAT WE'RE NOT
EVEN AWARE OF.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.112
THIS FUCKING
BULLSHIT,

10:46.178 --> 10:47.413
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO STAND FOR IT !

10:47.480 --> 10:48.848
HE'S THE BEST COP
ON THE FORCE !

10:48.914 --> 10:50.049
YOU STINK OF BOOZE,

10:50.116 --> 10:51.984
I'M NOT GONNA LET
A DRUNK LIKE YOU RUIN HIM.

10:52.051 --> 10:53.652
BURKE, YOU'RE
COVERING FOR HIM.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.721
PARTNERS
DO THAT.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.656
BUT YOU CAN'T PLAY
NURSEMAID TO HIM FOREVER.

10:57.723 --> 11:00.126
SOME DAY, TWITCH IS GOING
TO FORGET TO PULL HIS GUN

11:00.192 --> 11:02.528
WHEN IT REALLY COUNTS,
IN A SITUATION,

11:02.595 --> 11:05.598
AND SOMEBODY'S
GONNA GET KILLED.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.268
( Burke )
HE'S BUGGIN' THE FUCKING
SHIT OUT OF ME

11:09.335 --> 11:10.669
AND TWITCH COULD
KICK HIS ASS TOO,

11:10.736 --> 11:12.438
IF HE FELT BETTER.

11:16.575 --> 11:18.544
MY CAREER
JUST WENT AWAY.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.079
AM I CORRECT, SIR ?

11:20.146 --> 11:21.714
IT'S BANKS.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.816
I CAN SMELL
IT ON HIM.

11:23.883 --> 11:26.018
( thinking )
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU
HAVE A VERY SOLID LEAD.

11:26.085 --> 11:27.853
YOU'VE DONE
WELL, OFFICER.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.756
THE DEPARTMENT
IS PROUD OF YOU.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.658
THANK YOU, SIR.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.570
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GOING ?

11:44.637 --> 11:48.641
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED
TO TAKE CARE OF, SIR.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.077
ON MY OWN.

12:02.154 --> 12:05.324
AL, IS THAT YOU ?

12:05.391 --> 12:07.226
I'M HERE WITH
YOU, GRANNY.

12:07.293 --> 12:10.096
I'M SO HAPPY
YOU CAME.

12:10.162 --> 12:12.898
IT'S HARDEST
IN THE NIGHT.

12:12.965 --> 12:16.602
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR
WHOLE CLAN CAME BY.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.138
I'M GLAD WE DIDN'T
LOSE YOU, GRANNY.

12:19.205 --> 12:21.807
WANDA AND CYAN
NEED YOU.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.510
I KEEP BANGING ON
ST. PETER'S GATE,

12:24.577 --> 12:27.246
BUT HE JUST
CAN'T HEAR ME.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.116
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SORRY
THAT YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

12:30.182 --> 12:31.717
I AM.

12:31.784 --> 12:34.053
AND, I THINK YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.222
YOU MUST
HAVE REGRETS, TOO.

12:36.288 --> 12:38.124
WHAT ARE THEY ?

12:38.190 --> 12:41.794
THAT I LIVED,
WHEN OTHERS DIED

12:41.861 --> 12:43.929
AND THE LIVES I TOOK.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.798
GOD WILL
FORGIVE YOU.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.033
WHEN I LET
MY GUARD DOWN,

12:48.100 --> 12:51.103
ALL THE GHOSTS
COME BACK TO ME.

12:51.170 --> 12:52.771
THEY GATHER AROUND.

12:52.838 --> 12:56.475
WHAT COULD A SWEET
WOMAN LIKE YOU REGRET ?

12:56.542 --> 12:59.245
THAT I LIVED
SO LONG.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.413
YOUR FAMILY
NEEDED YOU.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.249
OH, DON'T
GET ME WRONG,

13:03.315 --> 13:05.885
I'M GLAD I SAW
THEM ALL GROW UP.

13:05.951 --> 13:10.422
WHEN JACK DIED,
WE WERE BOTH OLD ALREADY.

13:10.489 --> 13:13.359
I THOUGHT I WOULD
JOIN HIM SOON.

13:13.425 --> 13:16.095
I'VE LIVED ALL
THESE YEARS ALONE.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.097
YOU NEVER TALKED
MUCH ABOUT JACK.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.666
WHO WOULD WANT TO
LISTEN TO THE MEMORIES

13:20.733 --> 13:23.636
OF AN OLD WOMAN ?

13:23.702 --> 13:25.404
I DO.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.574
THE LAST THING
HE SAID TO ME WAS,

13:28.641 --> 13:33.512
"I WISH YOU COULD SEE
MY WRINKLED OLD FACE...

13:33.579 --> 13:39.218
THE LOVE I STILL HAVE
FOR YOU, IN MY EYES."

13:39.285 --> 13:42.087
I WISH YOU COULD
BRING JACK WITH YOU

13:42.154 --> 13:44.190
THE NEXT TIME.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.759
I NEED TO
TALK TO HIM.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.428
HE WOULD KNOW WHAT
TO DO ABOUT WANDA.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.197
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

13:51.263 --> 13:53.599
WELL.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.537
PLEASE, GRANNY,
TELL ME.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.276
SHE'S GOING
TO HAVE A BABY.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.377
WHAT ?

14:05.444 --> 14:07.846
BUT SHE DOESN'T
WANT IT.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.415
I HAVE TO GO.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.051
AL ?

14:13.452 --> 14:15.154
AL ?

14:20.793 --> 14:23.195
( Cogliostro )
THE HELL SPAWN
IS DRAWN HERE

14:23.262 --> 14:26.599
TO THIS GARDEN
OF STONE.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.001
HE STARES AT
THE TOMBS OF THE DEAD

14:29.068 --> 14:32.404
WONDERING IF THEY ALSO
SOLD THEIR SOULS,

14:32.471 --> 14:34.840
AS HE DID.

14:34.907 --> 14:38.877
HE HAS COME TO
THE CROSSROADS OF HIS EXISTENCE

14:38.944 --> 14:42.047
AND HE MUST CHOOSE
THE RIGHT PATH

14:42.114 --> 14:45.818
OR HE WILL BE CURSED
TO WALK THIS EARTH ALONE,

14:45.884 --> 14:48.654
REJECTED BY EVERYONE.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.832
IS THAT
YOUR GRAVE ?

14:59.898 --> 15:02.901
THIS IS WHERE
I BELONG...

15:02.968 --> 15:05.704
I'VE CAUSED SO MUCH
PAIN BY COMING BACK.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.806
YOU CAME BACK
FOR YOUR WIFE.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.375
FOR LOVE.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.010
I WOULD HAVE
DONE THE SAME.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.679
( horns sounding )

15:13.746 --> 15:17.483
TWO MORE BOUNTY HUNTERS
HAVE COME TO KILL ME.

15:17.549 --> 15:20.219
I SHOULD LET THEM.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.620
THEY'VE
COME FOR ME.

15:21.687 --> 15:22.955
WHY ?

15:23.022 --> 15:25.491
THEY WILL TREAT ME
AS A TRAITOR.

15:25.557 --> 15:28.560
I TOOK AN OATH
TO KILL HELL SPAWNS.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.362
IT IS ALL I'VE
EVER KNOWN.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.364
I HAVE SPARED
YOUR LIFE.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.700
BECAUSE OF
YOUR HEART.

15:37.036 --> 15:40.005
NO ONE HAS EVER KNOWN
WHAT IS IN MY HEART.

15:40.072 --> 15:45.010
BUT YOU CAN SHOW THEM
BY USING YOUR SHROUD

15:45.077 --> 15:48.180
FOR SOMETHING
GOOD AND DECENT.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.449
ONLY THEN WILL
YOUR NEW LIFE BEGIN.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.335
SO, DETECTIVE,

16:09.401 --> 16:11.370
WHERE'S YOUR SLOB
OF A PARTNER ?

16:11.437 --> 16:13.172
AS I SAID ON
THE PHONE, SIR,

16:13.238 --> 16:15.574
I WANTED IT TO BE
JUST YOU AND ME,

16:15.641 --> 16:17.743
COP TO COP.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.611
IS THAT SO ?

16:19.678 --> 16:22.314
WELL, YOU'VE
BECOME INCONVENIENT.

16:22.381 --> 16:26.218
MY FATHER WAS A COP,
MY BROTHERS, COPS.

16:26.285 --> 16:28.420
COP WAS
ALL I KNEW.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.456
I JUST WANTED TO
ARREST THE BAD GUYS.

16:30.522 --> 16:33.325
WHEN I WAS COMING
UP IN THE RANKS,

16:33.392 --> 16:35.527
I ADMIRED YOU, SIR.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.529
WHAT DO
I DO NOW ?

16:37.596 --> 16:40.065
YOU'RE
THE BAD GUY.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.901
I'M TAKING YOU
IN TONIGHT, SIR.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.967
ARE YOU OKAY, TWITCH ?

17:32.251 --> 17:34.486
SO YOU WERE
JASON WYNN'S BITCH.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.188
TWITCH GOT TOO CLOSE
TO FINDING OUT

17:36.255 --> 17:38.090
SO YOU SHOT HIM !

17:38.157 --> 17:40.325
GO TO HELL.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.063
( Twitch )
SIR, STOP, STOP !

17:45.130 --> 17:46.932
THIS ISN'T THE WAY !

17:46.999 --> 17:49.334
WHAT DO I DO NOW ?
DO I GO BY THE BOOK ?

17:49.401 --> 17:51.637
OR DO I GET SOME
JUSTICE HERE ?

18:09.888 --> 18:12.658
MY GUESS IS THAT'S
THE GUN USED TO
SHOOT MY PARTNER.

18:12.724 --> 18:14.359
AM I RIGHT ?

18:14.426 --> 18:15.928
AM I ?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.565
I SHOULD HAVE PUT
A BULLET IN YOUR HEAD

18:19.631 --> 18:22.067
LIKE I DID
YOUR PARTNER.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.338
YOUR CAN'T
DO THIS, SIR.

18:26.405 --> 18:29.608
YOU'RE NOT THIS KIND
OF COP, PLEASE, SIR.

18:32.211 --> 18:33.679
DO US ALL A FAVOR,

18:33.745 --> 18:36.014
SAVE US THE PAPERWORK
AND SPARE YOUR WIFE AND KIDS

18:36.081 --> 18:38.450
THE NEWS-FLASH THAT
YOU WERE A SCUMBAG.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.458
IT WILL BE
THE FIRST TIME
A DIRTY COP

18:46.525 --> 18:48.227
DID THE RIGHT THING.

18:50.262 --> 18:53.398
MAYBE YOUR FAMILY WILL
STILL GET YOUR PENSION.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.968
YOU THINK THEY'LL
TAKE YOUR WORD OVER MINE ?

18:56.034 --> 18:59.104
YOU DUMB
PIECE OF SHIT.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.340
I should have put
a bullet in your head

19:01.406 --> 19:03.675
like I did
your partner.

19:03.742 --> 19:06.612
EITHER WAY, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LIVE VERY LONG.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.447
IF YOU DON'T DO IT,

19:08.514 --> 19:10.549
YOUR BUDDY JASON WYNN
WILL DO IT FOR YOU.

19:10.616 --> 19:13.185
AND HE WON'T BE
SO QUICK ABOUT IT.

19:32.337 --> 19:36.241
( clown )
MAN, HAVE YOU
HAD A BAD DAY.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.048
THERE IS NO TIME
FOR REGRETS.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.983
IF YOU CAN CHANGE
AND DEFY HELL

19:45.050 --> 19:46.852
THEN I CAN
CHANGE, TOO,

19:46.919 --> 19:48.954
AND DEFY HEAVEN.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.556
( horns sounding )

19:50.622 --> 19:52.791
THE HUNTERS...

19:52.858 --> 19:55.093
... THEY'RE HERE.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.298
JADE !

20:00.966 --> 20:02.734
JADE !

20:25.324 --> 20:27.426
WHAT HAVE I DONE ?

20:27.492 --> 20:29.895
IF I AM KILLED NOW
BY THE HUNTERS,

20:29.962 --> 20:33.231
MY SOUL WILL DESCEND
TO HELL, FOREVER.

20:33.298 --> 20:36.001
HORRORS.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.771
JUST DO IT.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.375
AHHH !

20:48.981 --> 20:50.816
I WON'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.952
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT
I COULD BE ALLOWED TO GO

20:54.019 --> 20:55.954
TO THE ELYSIAN FIELDS.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.123
WHERE WARRIORS GO.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.858
WHO HAVEN'T
LOST THEIR HONOR,

20:59.925 --> 21:04.062
WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY
A HELL SPAWN IN BATTLE.

21:07.332 --> 21:09.368
I CAN'T DO THAT.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.537
THIS IS
NOT YOUR FIGHT.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.474
THEY'VE COME
FOR ME.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.744
IF YOU KILL THEM,
MORE WILL COME.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.713
WHAT KIND OF HEAVEN WOULD
KILL ONE OF THEIR OWN ?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.782
DON'T YOU
FEEL IT ?

21:23.849 --> 21:25.183
IT'S ALL CHANGING.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.886
THE SIDES AREN'T
AS CLEAR-CUT ANYMORE.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.921
I CAN'T KILL
FOR THEM.

21:29.988 --> 21:33.058
I'M TIRED,
I WANT SOME PEACE.

21:33.125 --> 21:37.295
PLEASE HELP ME
TO END IT, NOW.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.101
COME ON,
HELL SPAWN !

21:43.168 --> 21:44.536
FIGHT !

21:47.706 --> 21:51.143
PLEASE, SET ME FREE.

21:58.784 --> 22:02.187
NO, JADE,
I CAN'T DO THIS !

22:28.480 --> 22:30.348
NO REGRETS.

22:58.176 --> 23:00.779
WILL SHE BE
AT PEACE NOW ?

23:00.846 --> 23:02.647
I NEED TO KNOW.

23:02.714 --> 23:03.849
SHE WILL.

23:03.915 --> 23:05.984
SOMETHING YOU'LL
NEVER KNOW, HELL SPAWN.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.653
( Spawn )
KILL ME NOW,
GET IT OVER WITH.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.556
YOU'RE NOT IN
OUR CONTRACT,

23:11.623 --> 23:14.426
BUT WE'LL BE BACK
FOR THE CHILD.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.722
DO YOU TRUST ME,
GRANNY ?

23:46.024 --> 23:49.060
I TRUST YOU, AL.

23:49.127 --> 23:52.030
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE ONE THING YOU WISH FOR.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.533
DON'T BE AFRAID.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.618
MARY.

24:13.685 --> 24:15.420
JACK !

24:21.293 --> 24:23.028
DO YOU SEE THE LOVE
IN MY EYES ?

24:23.094 --> 24:25.430
YES, JACK,
I SEE IT.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.099
I SEE IT
IN YOUR EYES.

24:28.166 --> 24:30.802
I WANNA GO WITH YOU.

24:30.869 --> 24:34.172
IT'S NOT YOUR
TIME, MARY,

24:34.239 --> 24:36.741
PEOPLE NEED YOU.

24:36.808 --> 24:40.812
JACK, PLEASE.

24:40.879 --> 24:44.850
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU,
LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.751
WHEN YOU'RE ALONE
IN THE NIGHT.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.054
I HEAR YOU
TALKING TO ME, MARY.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.957
I HEAR YOUR PRAYERS.

25:04.769 --> 25:06.238
AL ?

25:06.304 --> 25:07.739
I'M STILL
WITH YOU, GRANNY.

25:07.806 --> 25:10.575
DID YOU SEE
MY JACK ?

25:10.642 --> 25:14.279
OH, SO YOUNG
AND HANDSOME.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.749
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HE SAID ?

25:17.816 --> 25:22.554
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF THE ONES WE LOVE.

25:22.621 --> 25:27.692
I'VE ONLY BEEN BLESSED
TWICE IN MY LIFE.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.428
BY THE LORD
AND NOW BY YOU.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.564
IT WASN'T ME,
GRANNY.

25:32.631 --> 25:36.534
IT WAS THE POWER OF
THE ONE WHO SENT ME.

26:00.892 --> 26:05.130
WHAT ARE YOU
PREPARED TO DO ?

26:08.099 --> 26:10.468
I PLEDGE
EVERYTHING I OWN,

26:10.535 --> 26:12.470
EVERYTHING
I HAVE LEFT,

26:12.537 --> 26:14.539
MY HEART INCLUDED.

26:14.606 --> 26:18.310
I WANT MY
HUMANITY BACK.
