WEBVTT

00:22.500 --> 00:24.500
Will he ask me
or won't he?

00:40.667 --> 00:42.542
Maddy?

00:42.625 --> 00:44.291
Hey, Michael.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.625
I wanted to ask
you something.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.458
Um, about the Valentine's dance?

00:48.542 --> 00:49.458
Yeah?

00:49.542 --> 00:51.625

00:51.709 --> 00:53.500
- You know, like--
- Your date?

00:53.583 --> 00:54.959
If someone already asked, just..

00:55.041 --> 00:57.750
- No.
- ...forget it.

00:57.834 --> 01:00.875
I mean, no, nobody asked.

01:02.208 --> 01:03.625
You sure you wanna go with me?

01:03.709 --> 01:06.208
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

01:06.291 --> 01:07.333
Yes.

01:09.458 --> 01:11.500
I'm late for
first period, but I..

01:11.583 --> 01:13.333
I'll see ya later?

01:13.417 --> 01:15.458
See ya.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.333
"But to whom
can I be responsible

01:57.417 --> 01:59.500
when you refuse
to see me?"

02:24.083 --> 02:27.792
Help! Somebody! Help!

02:28.542 --> 02:30.166
'You're okay.'

02:30.250 --> 02:32.041
'You're okay, you're okay.'

02:50.750 --> 02:52.250
(Jeffries)
ADA Thomas stopped by.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.917
Asked about you, Scotty.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.458
Yeah. What about?

02:55.542 --> 02:57.250
Just asked
about you.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.000
She's hot.

02:59.083 --> 03:00.834
If you like
that type.

03:00.917 --> 03:03.250
And what type
is that exactly?

03:03.333 --> 03:06.542
- Ballbuster.
- Like I said, smokin'.

03:06.625 --> 03:08.500
That ballbusting
neighbor
still giving you grief

03:08.583 --> 03:09.834
about that basketball?

03:09.917 --> 03:12.750
- Way past grief.
- Oh yeah? Do tell.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.000
Another one
bites the dust.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.000
Get out while you
still got time.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.792
Thinkin' long term
on this one, Nick?

03:17.875 --> 03:20.250
- He got tickets to the
ballet.
- Ooh!

03:20.333 --> 03:22.041
Sensitive guy.
You like that?

03:22.125 --> 03:24.417
Yeah. Don't be late. Again.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.583
Toni gets it.
Life of a cop.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.125
Where's Miller?

03:29.208 --> 03:31.166
Storage.
Been mopin' all morning.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.792
Oh, yeah?
What's up?

03:32.875 --> 03:35.542
Probably hormones.

03:35.625 --> 03:37.083
Hormones?

03:39.041 --> 03:42.041
Yeah, you know,
that female cycle
thing.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.792
Sensitive guy.

03:50.208 --> 03:51.291
What?

03:55.041 --> 03:56.583
What?

04:07.375 --> 04:09.208
Cold job?

04:09.291 --> 04:11.667
Skill Jones.

04:11.750 --> 04:14.208
Knew him, so to speak.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.375
- That right?
- I was working undercover.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.208
Doing drug buys
in North Philly.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.166
It was a lifetime ago.

04:22.125 --> 04:24.458
Looks like a nice kid.

04:24.542 --> 04:25.750
Dealer.

04:25.834 --> 04:27.125
Deep in the game.

04:27.208 --> 04:30.000
I was the one
who found him.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.166
Help!

04:32.166 --> 04:33.333
Help!

04:33.417 --> 04:36.166
Somebody! Help!

04:36.250 --> 04:37.750
Look at me. Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.291
Look at me.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.166
<i>Keep looking at me.</i>
<i>Keep looking at me.</i>

04:41.250 --> 04:43.333
Kid died in my arms.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.041
He was 15.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.291
Is that why you
came down here?

04:52.375 --> 04:55.583
First time since
I made murder cop.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.542
Always wondered
when I would.

04:57.625 --> 04:58.792
So why today?

04:58.875 --> 05:00.750
Fifth-year anniversary
of his death.

05:02.458 --> 05:05.250
I found that box next to his.

05:05.333 --> 05:08.875
Madison Reed.
Chestnut Hill, rich
kid.

05:08.959 --> 05:10.750
Both shot and
killed
same day.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.959
Exact same time.

05:13.041 --> 05:14.667
8:03 a.m.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.792
Weird.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.542
Jobs could
be connected.

05:18.625 --> 05:22.000
White girl from the 'burbs,
dealer from the projects?

05:22.083 --> 05:23.834
Seeing someone die..

05:25.583 --> 05:27.959
...kinda changes you forever.

05:28.041 --> 05:31.667
- Yeah. It does.
- Don't know much about him.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.583
Except his name.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.625
You need a reason
to open a job.

05:35.709 --> 05:38.625
No one left
to
speak for
Skill.

05:38.709 --> 05:40.750
For Madison.

05:40.834 --> 05:43.542
Except us.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.834
Maybe that's reason enough?

06:27.542 --> 06:28.792
(Rush)
'Madison Reed.'

06:28.875 --> 06:31.000
Shot with a 357 magnum
at close range.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.625
That's a rare weapon.

06:32.709 --> 06:35.750
- Any luck tracking it down?
- Turned that school inside
out.

06:35.834 --> 06:37.625
Got no weapon, no motive.

06:37.709 --> 06:39.375
Kinda crime doesn't
happen
in Chestnut Hill.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.458
Chalked it up
to random violence.

06:41.542 --> 06:43.125
Job went cold after a year.

06:43.208 --> 06:45.709
- What about Skill Jones?
- 'Small-time punk.'

06:45.792 --> 06:47.834
Theory was a drug deal
gone south.

06:47.917 --> 06:49.625
Gave up on him
after a few weeks.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.709
(Stillman)
We have a last to see?

06:51.792 --> 06:53.000
Not on Skill.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.792
But another
kid,
Michael Ellis

06:54.875 --> 06:57.458
saw Madison at school
right before she was
shot.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.792
Uh, Scotty and
I'll
have a talk.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.667
Madison was a
straight "A" student.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.792
Track star, student
government type.

07:03.875 --> 07:05.750
What's the connect to Skill?

07:05.834 --> 07:07.125
We don't know yet.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.291
You got any informants
left from your narc days?

07:14.375 --> 07:15.500
Toomey Nelson.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.208
Crackhead, junk peddler.

07:17.291 --> 07:18.792
North Philly 411.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.291
(Vera)
Can't say I don't
take you anywhere nice.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.375
'Least I don't go to the ballet.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.542
Yo, wassup, dawg?

07:41.625 --> 07:44.250
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, damn!

07:44.333 --> 07:47.041
Five-oh! Five-oh!

07:47.125 --> 07:48.375
(Miller)
'Yeah, that's right.'

07:48.458 --> 07:50.458
The po-po's rollin', y'all.

07:50.542 --> 07:53.208
Yo, baby girl, where's them
stilettos and the tube top?

07:53.291 --> 07:54.875
Yeah, well..

07:54.959 --> 07:56.875
I be respectable now.

07:56.959 --> 07:57.959
Says you.

07:58.041 --> 07:59.375
So, what? You the boyfriend?

07:59.458 --> 08:02.125
- Philly Homicide, homeslice.
- No doubt.

08:04.959 --> 08:07.750
I give you the
po-po discount. Two dollar.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.417
Think I'll pass.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.500
How 'bout the bling?

08:12.583 --> 08:14.875
Well, that's not
for sale, baby girl.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.166
That's my dreamcatcher.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.709
How 'bout some
tube socks, instead?

08:18.792 --> 08:20.875
Thinkin' I might
need some 411.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.417
Oww!

08:22.500 --> 08:23.750
Bring it!

08:23.834 --> 08:25.458
Remember that
dealer got
shot?

08:25.542 --> 08:27.000
Skill Jones?

08:27.083 --> 08:28.417
Skill was good people.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.041
Gave Toomey respect.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.375
That don't come
cheap out here.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.417
- You owe him then?
- No doubt.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.208
I didn't speak my piece
back in the day

08:35.291 --> 08:38.000
but now Champ's audi.
You know what I'm sayin'.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.583
- Who's Champ?
- Dealer.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.959
Worked the Wilson
projects back in
2002.

08:42.041 --> 08:45.750
Word was he was movin' in
on a house run by Skill's
posse.

08:45.834 --> 08:47.875
- Turf war?
- Well, over new product.

08:47.959 --> 08:51.250
Tried to take Champ
outta commission for real.

08:51.333 --> 08:52.792
Yeah?

08:52.875 --> 08:56.041
- Who'd you hear this from?
- Seen it with my own eyes.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.625
- Mmph!
- When'd this go down?

09:03.709 --> 09:06.333
Few weeks before Skill
get himself shot.

09:06.417 --> 09:10.583
And of all nights,
on the New Year.

09:14.542 --> 09:15.542
[muffled scream]
'No!'

09:17.500 --> 09:20.792
Champ, don't never wanna
catch you near the house.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.458
Hear?
I can't hear
you.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.166
I can't hear you!

09:27.667 --> 09:29.000
You dissin' me, homey?

09:29.083 --> 09:31.041
'That it?'

09:32.875 --> 09:34.792
- You a man now, Skill.
- 'That's right.'

09:34.875 --> 09:37.542
'It's time you
earned them stripes.'

09:38.792 --> 09:40.208
- Huh?
- "Huh?" You a bitch, too?

09:40.291 --> 09:43.000
- Nah, man. Nah.
- Then get to it, homey.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.417
Took half of Champ's ear
off with them pliers.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.417
- Cold.
- Champ go after Skill?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.667
Tried to, but Skill
went underground.

10:07.750 --> 10:08.917
Where to?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Only fams was his gramps

10:10.083 --> 10:11.333
up in the projects.

10:11.417 --> 10:13.959
So what was the turf
they were warrin'
over?

10:14.041 --> 10:17.166
Shootin' gallery
on 6th and MLK.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.917
Cookhouse for a lil' bit of
hell
called methamphetamine.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.709
- Alright, Toomey.
- Hmm.

10:22.792 --> 10:24.750
Holler me if you
hear anything
else.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.417
I don't touch
the crunk myself.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.375
(Rush)
'You were the last to see
Madison alive, Michael.'

10:43.458 --> 10:45.542
I asked her to some stupid
dance that morning, yeah.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.542
Were you two boyfriend
and girlfriend?

10:47.625 --> 10:49.625
No, we kinda grew up together,
but, not really, no.

10:49.709 --> 10:51.583
She have a beef with
any of your
classmates?

10:51.667 --> 10:53.792
No way. Maddy was like totally
popular. Everyone loved her.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.792
Was she dabbling in drugs
at all, Michael?

10:55.875 --> 10:57.709
Nah. No, no way.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.250
Wanna look at me
when you answer that?

11:02.041 --> 11:04.750
Maybe you'll feel more
comfortable talking downtown.

11:04.834 --> 11:06.083
Wait a minute,
are you arresting
me?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.625
Not if you stop lying.

11:10.542 --> 11:13.083
It was like a few weeks
before she was...you know.

11:13.166 --> 11:15.417
- Shot.
- Yeah.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.959
Our moms had this book club.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.000
That day it was
Madison's house.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.917
- Go on.
- Her dad had just took off.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.500
Leaving them penniless
basically.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.458
It was really awkward

11:27.542 --> 11:30.125
'cause in Chestnut
Hill
money's everything.

11:35.667 --> 11:36.834
Hey, Maddy.

11:36.917 --> 11:38.917
My mom sent this.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.709
She, uh, couldn't make
the book club.

11:41.792 --> 11:43.125
She..

11:43.208 --> 11:45.917
Had another
engagement?

11:46.000 --> 11:50.458
Funny how busy everyone's
mom is since my dad left.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.583
Are you okay?

11:53.667 --> 11:57.291
Got a "D" in
Orman's
English class.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.250
That wench gives D's
to everyone.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.166
Maybe if I didn't

12:01.250 --> 12:03.500
he would have stayed.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.750
Your dad didn't leave
because of your "D," Maddy.

12:10.709 --> 12:12.125
How do you know?

12:13.959 --> 12:17.000
It's, like, gonna burn you
if you don't put it down.

12:17.083 --> 12:19.125
Oh.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.792
[whispers]
Please don't tell anybody.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.000
(Mrs. Reed)
'Why, Michael.'

12:32.083 --> 12:35.041
I thought I
heard
you come in.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.875
Is your mom here, too?

12:36.959 --> 12:39.667
She, uh, had
something to do.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.959
So good seeing you, Michael.

12:43.041 --> 12:46.000
You grow an inch
every time I do.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.083
Madison, how many times
do I have to tell you

12:48.166 --> 12:50.583
to clean up your stuff?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Yearbook, Mrs. Reed.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.625
Madison never
stops, does
she?

12:58.083 --> 12:59.709
Uh, I should go.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.792
See you, Maddy.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.166
See ya.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.000
I didn't tell anyone.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.458
Maybe I should have.

13:14.458 --> 13:15.709
And those vials.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.208
Sounds like crack or meth.

13:17.291 --> 13:18.750
Looks like we got
our connect.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.750
You ever seen
this guy, Michael?

13:23.041 --> 13:24.709
- No. Who is he?
- A drug dealer.

13:24.792 --> 13:26.417
- From North Philly.
- Drug dealer?

13:26.500 --> 13:29.667
I don't think Madison went to
that part of town, like, ever.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.083
No kidding.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.083
I know I'm late.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.375
Like I said..

13:47.458 --> 13:49.667
- ...life of a cop.
- Life of a cop, huh?

13:51.125 --> 13:52.709
Cop who's still
got those
tickets

13:52.792 --> 13:54.834
in case someone's
interested.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.917
Think it's
too late for that.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.125
It won't happen again, Toni.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.291
You said that the last time.

14:07.959 --> 14:10.041
I was working this job.

14:11.250 --> 14:14.333
Kid wasn't much
older
than Andre.

14:14.417 --> 14:17.083
Never seen Andre
take to someone

14:17.166 --> 14:19.125
the way he does to you.

14:19.208 --> 14:20.750
He's a good kid.

14:20.834 --> 14:22.291
He's mine.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.959
Don't wanna make promises
I can't deliver.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.750
Who's saying I can't deliver?

14:26.834 --> 14:29.291
You can't make it to
a date, Nick, come on.

14:31.959 --> 14:34.125
What's this
really
about, Toni?

14:35.709 --> 14:39.041
I never intended
to settle down with a cop.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.542
'Wondering every night if
he'll walk through that
door.'

14:42.625 --> 14:44.583
I never intended
on being Insta-Dad

14:44.667 --> 14:47.125
but sometimes life
throws you a curve.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.417
Are you saying
my son's a burden?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.375
No.

14:51.792 --> 14:53.417
I'm saying give me a shot.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.583
I can't.

15:08.792 --> 15:10.333
Sorry, Nick.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.792
A super achiever like Madison
could have used meth

15:32.875 --> 15:34.333
to pull all-nighters.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.125
How it usually starts.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.458
Next thing you know,
you're hooked to the
grave.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.875
No tox report
from her autopsy.

15:40.959 --> 15:43.000
Goody Two-Shoes
like her, no need.

15:43.083 --> 15:45.083
Could be Skill
was her dealer.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.542
Or someone
closer to
home.

15:47.625 --> 15:50.834
Gibby Hanes, senior at
Madison's high school.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.041
'Misdemeanor arrest
for slinging meth.'

15:53.125 --> 15:54.208
Pleaded out
as a minor.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.542
- 'First-time offense.'
- 'Yeah.'

15:57.500 --> 15:59.750
Chestnut Hill bling talks.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.875
- North Philly bling don't.
- Let's bring Gibby in. And
mom.

16:04.959 --> 16:07.208
Any 411 on Skill?

16:07.291 --> 16:10.750
Suspect numero uno,
local
drug rival named Champ.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.500
Bit the big one
a few months
back.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.166
Is that right?

16:16.750 --> 16:20.583
Clockers' shelf life
being what it is.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.875
Leaving us high and dry.

16:22.959 --> 16:25.000
But Skill's
gramps
is still around.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.542
Maybe that's where
he hid out.

16:26.625 --> 16:29.375
- 'You'll have a talk with
him.'
- 'Yeah, we're on it.'

16:30.542 --> 16:32.875
You think Madison
was a drug addict?

16:32.959 --> 16:35.583
- Excuse me, you are?
- I'm her mother.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.917
And you're
wrong,
dead wrong.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.375
Maddy was a good girl.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.041
'Michael had no right
to tell you that.'

16:41.125 --> 16:42.458
Why don't we
talk in private?

16:42.542 --> 16:44.750
It's bad enough that you
never found her killer.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.709
And now you're
blaming her?

16:46.792 --> 16:48.959
I think you've
done
enough already.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.166
What a parent
doesn't know.

17:04.417 --> 17:06.792
(Mr. Jones)
Skill lost his daddy
to the needle.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.875
is mama to the pipe.

17:08.959 --> 17:11.667
You might say white powder
is the family curse.

17:11.750 --> 17:14.083
You were all Skill
had left in the
world.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.125
Since he was but a baby.

17:16.208 --> 17:19.000
I loved that boy like
he was the sun and the moon.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.750
But you know
Skill
was in the game.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.333
I tried to stop him

17:23.417 --> 17:28.083
but then the word showed him
the error of his ways.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.458
You want to elaborate,
Mr. Jones?

17:30.542 --> 17:33.959
New Year's Eve,
about three weeks

17:34.041 --> 17:36.375
before the Lord
took him from
me.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.041
Same night they
worked over Champ.

17:38.125 --> 17:41.333
What happened
on New Year's Eve?

17:41.417 --> 17:44.417
My grandson finally came home.

17:47.917 --> 17:52.458
(crowd on TV)
Six, five, four
three, two, one!

17:56.709 --> 17:58.417
Skill?

17:58.500 --> 18:00.959
Skill, that you?

18:01.041 --> 18:02.333
Skill.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.333
What's wrong with you, boy?

18:06.417 --> 18:09.291
- You're bleeding, son.
- Don't touch me!

18:11.083 --> 18:13.166
I can't get it off!

18:13.250 --> 18:15.583
- Grandpa.
- What'd you do, boy?

18:20.375 --> 18:22.667
I...I hurt a kid.

18:28.709 --> 18:31.000
You got to get out
the game, Skill.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.875
You hear me?

18:32.959 --> 18:34.834
Who's gonna take
care of the
bills?

18:34.917 --> 18:37.333
Who's gonna take
care of you,
grandpa?

18:37.417 --> 18:38.625
Who?

18:38.709 --> 18:40.792
That gun ain't
the answer.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.041
Never was, it
never will be.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.166
All I know is
banging,
grandpa.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.709
Then you got to
dream bigger dreams.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.166
Like what?

18:48.250 --> 18:49.208
Go back to school.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.709
Make somethin'
of yourself.

18:51.792 --> 18:54.083
I...I just want..

18:57.208 --> 19:00.166
- What, Skill?
- To find peace.

19:11.333 --> 19:14.875
Skill got out the streets,
stayed here with me

19:14.959 --> 19:16.875
and went back to school.

19:16.959 --> 19:17.959
'But then he died.'

19:18.041 --> 19:19.917
What kind of gun
did Skill have?

19:21.083 --> 19:23.667
357 Glock. Why?

19:23.750 --> 19:25.917
Same type of gun
that killed Madison.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.959
You ever see this girl,
Mr. Jones?

19:31.625 --> 19:33.625
Maybe with Skill?

19:33.709 --> 19:36.291
White girl?

19:36.375 --> 19:38.208
I don't think so, no.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.417
Who is she?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.959
Killed the same day
your grandson was.

19:48.875 --> 19:52.750
Anything else,
give us a call.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.542
That why y'all care now?

19:56.625 --> 19:58.208
About Skill?

19:58.291 --> 19:59.667
'Cause a white girl died?

20:02.083 --> 20:04.083
I was the one who found him..

20:04.166 --> 20:05.500
...Mr. Jones.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.959
On that playground.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.125
Did he find peace?

20:16.417 --> 20:18.000
I don't know.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.417
Stockbroker?

20:28.500 --> 20:31.959
- Pay as well as drug dealing?
- Your partner's funny.

20:32.041 --> 20:34.166
You remember a kid
named Madison Reed?

20:34.250 --> 20:35.500
Shot down in the schoolyard.

20:35.583 --> 20:37.208
And that's
relevant
to me how?

20:37.291 --> 20:38.917
We know about you
slinging, Gibby.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.583
So, ahem, lose
the "aw, shucks"
act.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.125
I was small potatoes, okay?

20:42.208 --> 20:44.500
The most I sold was dried out
pot from my sock drawer.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.208
Says here you dealt meth.

20:46.291 --> 20:49.083
Look, I peddled a few vials
at school, okay? So what?

20:49.166 --> 20:51.458
Selling to
rich
teenyboppers.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.000
- Tough guy.
- At least I got laid.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.458
Wasn't a jock, so I was
Chestnut Hill's Tony Montana.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.959
"Say hello to my little friend."

21:01.041 --> 21:03.000
Big man on campus, huh?

21:03.083 --> 21:04.458
So why'd you quit slinging?

21:04.542 --> 21:06.750
'Cause I almost blew up
my mom's Viking stove.

21:06.834 --> 21:10.125
- She would have freaked.
- So, Madison bought from you?

21:10.208 --> 21:11.333
Like I said,
I was done dealing
it

21:11.417 --> 21:12.750
so I brought
her
to the source.

21:12.834 --> 21:14.333
Out of the goodness
of your heart.

21:14.417 --> 21:15.709
She was hot.

21:15.792 --> 21:17.291
Freshman. Drool, drool.

21:17.375 --> 21:18.333
Plus she gave me 20 bucks.

21:18.417 --> 21:20.333
Talk about where
you took her.

21:20.417 --> 21:24.000
Was a cookhouse on 6th
and MLK in North
Philly.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.750
Where the big boys played.

21:25.834 --> 21:28.041
In the same house
Skill's boys worked.

21:28.125 --> 21:30.583
- That where she scored?
- Wrong again.

21:30.667 --> 21:33.458
Let's just say that she had
a soft spot for the
crunkheads.

21:46.959 --> 21:50.125
What a bunch of sad sacks.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.375
I'm audi in, like,
two seconds.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.125
[whispering]
You cannot leave me
here.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.667
Mom.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.083
Mom!

22:09.166 --> 22:10.291
Mom!

22:10.375 --> 22:12.709
- Maddy. Is that you, baby?
- Mom?

22:12.792 --> 22:14.458
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.083
For two days!

22:17.166 --> 22:19.875
You're such a good girl,
Maddy.
You know that?

22:19.959 --> 22:21.917
You promised you'd quit,
you'd stop this time!

22:22.000 --> 22:24.917
I know, I tried, I did.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.250
But I just..

22:26.333 --> 22:28.417
...wanna not feel
things anymore.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.750
So just let me
do that, okay?

22:29.834 --> 22:32.625
I want to go home.
Please, mom.

22:32.709 --> 22:34.834
But it's just like
Heaven here, sweetie.

22:34.917 --> 22:37.583
Don't you see
how pretty it is?

22:37.667 --> 22:38.917
We're in Heaven.

22:49.333 --> 22:50.625
Pathetic, huh?

22:50.709 --> 22:52.417
Some people have
no self-control.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.583
Her mom was
the meth addict?

22:54.667 --> 22:56.917
- Not Madison?
- Bingo.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.917
I sold to Mrs. Reed
once
at some PTA meeting.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.125
Middle-aged loser.

23:01.208 --> 23:03.417
Yeah, but then,
you stopped dealing.

23:04.750 --> 23:07.250
So, Shirley had to look
for her fix elsewhere.

23:08.208 --> 23:10.834
In Skill's sort of heaven.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.291
Madison was a good girl,
Shirley.

23:23.375 --> 23:24.750
Too bad you weren't.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.375
I'm not sure I understand.

23:27.709 --> 23:30.500
The Jenny Crank diet,
does that ring any bells?

23:30.583 --> 23:32.291
Coming in here with an
attitude
when you were nothing

23:32.375 --> 23:34.625
but a tweaker,
a junkie, a crankhead.

23:34.709 --> 23:37.291
You have no right to
talk to me like that.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.667
You bought drugs from
a kid in Madison's school.

23:38.750 --> 23:40.166
And when that well dried up

23:40.250 --> 23:42.834
you left your daughter
for days looking to score.

23:42.917 --> 23:45.750
- You've got no proof of
that.
- 'You want proof?'

23:45.834 --> 23:47.709
Your daughter is six feet
under because of you.

23:47.792 --> 23:49.000
You've known for five years

23:49.083 --> 23:50.667
why she was killed,
so enough with the bull.

23:50.750 --> 23:54.000
I was trying to hold it
together
after my husband left, okay?

23:54.083 --> 23:56.333
The bills and the house.

23:56.417 --> 23:57.875
Trying to pretend
that we were okay

23:57.959 --> 23:59.500
when we were drowning.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.333
Oh, smoking meth.

24:01.417 --> 24:03.166
That's the answer?

24:03.250 --> 24:04.667
It was a nightmare.

24:04.750 --> 24:06.208
And I couldn't wake up.

24:06.291 --> 24:08.125
I had no one to turn to.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.000
You recognize him?

24:21.625 --> 24:24.375
He's someone I'd buy
from at the house.

24:28.375 --> 24:31.458
Madison used to give me
that look, too.

24:31.542 --> 24:35.875
So...disappointed in me..

24:35.959 --> 24:37.208
...again.

24:37.291 --> 24:40.083
Looks like you got clean.

24:40.166 --> 24:44.041
I tried so many times.

24:44.125 --> 24:47.750
But if addiction was a
battle,
rehab was war.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.250
I'll get clean, Maddy.

24:52.333 --> 24:54.041
This time I will.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.834
- Okay, mom.
- You don't believe me, baby.

24:58.625 --> 25:01.500
You always say that and
it always ends up the same.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.875
Not this time.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.333
I promise.

25:06.083 --> 25:09.667
- Do you remember when dad left?
- What?

25:09.750 --> 25:13.041
- You promised we'd be okay.
- I did? I don't remember.

25:15.041 --> 25:16.125
I do.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.583
Then we will.

25:24.041 --> 25:25.250
Excuse me?

25:25.333 --> 25:27.083
Mrs. Reed?

25:27.166 --> 25:29.250
Yeah? That's my mom.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.792
We can't admit you tonight.

25:32.667 --> 25:34.959
- What? Why not?
- We don't have the room.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.333
The city's
been overwhelmed.

25:36.417 --> 25:38.458
All the clinics
are filled to capacity.

25:38.542 --> 25:40.500
If you don't take
her,
she'll go out
again.

25:40.583 --> 25:41.458
Madison, please.

25:41.542 --> 25:43.250
I sleep in her
bed every night

25:43.333 --> 25:45.333
so if she leaves,
I know and I can stop her.

25:45.417 --> 25:47.000
But sometimes
I can't stop her.

25:47.083 --> 25:49.500
There's nothing I can
do, I'm sorry.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.041
Please help us.

25:58.417 --> 25:59.458
Please.

26:00.417 --> 26:02.667
There's a number you can call.

26:02.750 --> 26:03.875
I'll get it.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.125
Maddy?

26:10.208 --> 26:11.917
Maddy, what are we
gonna do now?

26:22.166 --> 26:25.291
I went out that night
and got high.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.500
And the next night.

26:29.583 --> 26:32.458
Until one day
my little girl was gone.

26:34.166 --> 26:35.583
Too late for her.

26:40.250 --> 26:43.375
It takes everything
I've got.

26:43.458 --> 26:45.792
'Every single day not
to go out and score.'

26:47.792 --> 26:51.166
But I made my daughter
a promise.

26:51.250 --> 26:53.417
And I intend to keep it.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.875
(Vera)
'This Skill's high school?'

27:07.959 --> 27:10.500
Gramps said he came back
here before he died.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.709
It's none of my business

27:14.792 --> 27:16.417
so if you don't wanna
answer,
that's fine by me.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.000
Toni dumped me.

27:18.083 --> 27:20.667
For real? Why?

27:20.750 --> 27:23.291
Cop's hours, the life,
who wants it?

27:23.375 --> 27:24.709
Yeah. I hear that.

27:26.291 --> 27:27.417
You okay?

27:30.417 --> 27:33.000
For a second there,
I thought she was the one.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.250
(Miller)
'Skill Jones.'

27:39.333 --> 27:41.208
His grandfather said
he was in school

27:41.291 --> 27:42.583
before he was killed.

27:42.667 --> 27:46.041
He was in my class
for exactly three weeks.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.333
- And then he dropped out.
- Why?

27:48.417 --> 27:52.000
Because he knew he had no future
in academia? I don't know.

27:52.083 --> 27:54.000
You remember any interactions
Skill might have had

27:54.083 --> 27:55.583
with fellow students

27:55.667 --> 27:56.917
over this?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.792
(Vera)
'357 Glock.'

27:58.875 --> 28:02.041
There was one kid,
came looking for Skill

28:02.125 --> 28:04.291
but I don't think
it was a gun he wanted.

28:05.375 --> 28:07.333
Take your seats, now.

28:07.417 --> 28:10.125
Deshawn, Shanelle,
do I look like I'm playing?

28:12.000 --> 28:15.709
Now if you'll open your books,
I'd like somebody to read.

28:15.792 --> 28:16.917
'Skill?'

28:17.000 --> 28:18.291
"I..

28:18.375 --> 28:22.333
"I...a-am..

28:24.375 --> 28:26.583
...one...of--"

28:26.667 --> 28:30.667
"The most
irresponsible beings..

28:30.750 --> 28:33.959
"...tha-that's...e-ever..

28:34.041 --> 28:35.083
...lyved."

28:35.166 --> 28:38.125
Lived. The correct
pronunciation is lived.

28:44.083 --> 28:47.625
"Ir...irr.."

28:47.709 --> 28:50.500
"Irresponsibility is part
of my invisibility."

28:50.583 --> 28:52.291
Come on, Skill.

28:56.667 --> 29:01.125
"To...who-m..

29:01.208 --> 29:04.083
...can-can--"

29:04.166 --> 29:06.375
This is 9th grade level,
for goodness sakes.

29:06.458 --> 29:07.792
Don't you know
how to read?

29:07.875 --> 29:10.333
[students exclaiming]
'Oh.'

29:11.041 --> 29:13.041
[sighs]
Go on.

29:13.125 --> 29:14.667
No.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.625
- What did you say to me?
- I said no.

29:17.709 --> 29:19.250
[students exclaiming]
Oh.

29:20.792 --> 29:24.000
If you won't obey the rules
of my classroom, you can leave.

29:24.083 --> 29:26.250
Now.

29:26.333 --> 29:29.083
"But to..

29:29.166 --> 29:30.667
"...who-who-m..

29:30.750 --> 29:36.250
"...can I-I be..

29:36.333 --> 29:40.500
"...re-re-spon-sible..

29:42.625 --> 29:45.375
...when you refuse
to see me?"

29:45.458 --> 29:47.166
[man shouts]
'Skill! Skill!'

29:47.250 --> 29:49.750
Get in your seats!
Now!

29:51.041 --> 29:52.417
Skill!

29:52.500 --> 29:54.125
Skill!

29:54.208 --> 29:55.750
Skill!

29:55.834 --> 29:57.417
One of your customers
is calling.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.667
I don't deal no more.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.166
Once a hood, always a hood.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.625
No doubt.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.208
[students exclaiming]
Oh.

30:15.125 --> 30:17.875
- Is this the kid you saw?
- Yes.

30:17.959 --> 30:20.083
Now if you don't
mind,
the hordes will be

30:20.166 --> 30:22.291
storming the fort
any minute now.

30:24.041 --> 30:26.750
Looks like our Chestnut Hill
prep and our North Philly

30:26.834 --> 30:28.875
drug dealer were
pretty copasetic.

30:28.959 --> 30:30.875
Funny how Michael
left that out.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.083
You and Skill
were tight, Michael.

30:38.166 --> 30:39.625
I didn't know that kid.

30:39.709 --> 30:42.166
Got an eyewitness
who saw you with
Skill.

30:42.250 --> 30:43.792
It's time to come clean.

30:45.834 --> 30:47.667
Look..

30:47.750 --> 30:50.041
...I knew about
Madison's mom, okay?

30:51.458 --> 30:52.875
And the drugs.

30:53.667 --> 30:54.792
How?

30:54.875 --> 30:56.375
Because I kept going
over to their house.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.750
- I saw how she got.
- So, why not tell anybody?

30:58.834 --> 31:01.166
Because stuff like that
doesn't happen in Chestnut
Hill.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.625
People were already
treating them like dirt.

31:03.709 --> 31:05.750
You had to protect Madison.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.417
Then one weekend
she just disappeared.

31:09.500 --> 31:12.000
- When was this?
- The weekend before she died.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.375
Did you find her?

31:15.458 --> 31:17.750
I asked Gibby, he knew
everything about drugs.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.875
He said that she was probably
out looking for her mom again.

31:20.959 --> 31:22.125
Told me about Skill.

31:22.208 --> 31:24.792
That's why you were
at Skill's school?

31:24.875 --> 31:26.959
At first, he wouldn't
take me to Maddy.

31:27.041 --> 31:29.792
Wouldn't take my money
or anything.

31:29.875 --> 31:32.625
And then I told him,
you know--

31:32.709 --> 31:33.875
Told him what?

31:36.375 --> 31:37.875
That I loved her.

31:38.875 --> 31:42.291
I was gonna be
the big hero.

31:42.375 --> 31:44.625
But when I found
Madison
in that house

31:46.208 --> 31:47.291
she was already gone.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.834
Hey, hey.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.834
That her?
That your girl?

32:20.917 --> 32:21.959
Yo.

32:30.125 --> 32:32.333
I came for my mom.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.792
To bring her home.

32:34.875 --> 32:37.625
But I-I can't find her.

32:37.709 --> 32:40.917
I got so tired, you know?

32:41.041 --> 32:42.583
I just wanna..

32:42.667 --> 32:45.709
...not feel things anymore.

32:45.792 --> 32:48.291
Go to her, man.

32:55.875 --> 32:57.250
Hey.

32:57.333 --> 32:58.375
Hey.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.667
Your boyfriend here..

33:01.750 --> 33:03.709
...came to bring you home.

33:05.667 --> 33:08.875
- There's nothing for me there.
- Nothing for you here, either.

33:14.041 --> 33:16.417
Yo, come on.
Get on up.

33:16.500 --> 33:17.834
You don't belong here.

33:17.917 --> 33:19.166
You're just a kid.

33:20.625 --> 33:22.667
So are you.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.583
Me and you?

33:24.667 --> 33:25.917
We're worlds apart.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.917
I just wanna..

33:35.166 --> 33:37.917
...disappear.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.375
Become invisible.

33:40.458 --> 33:43.083
'Cause no one even sees me.

33:43.166 --> 33:45.542
Hey. You ain't invisible.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.667
'Cause I can see you.

33:47.750 --> 33:48.875
And you got to, too.

33:48.959 --> 33:52.750
Even if no one else
in the whole world does.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.625
Let's go home.

33:54.709 --> 33:55.834
You and me both.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.333
Okay.

33:59.417 --> 34:00.709
Come on.

34:05.333 --> 34:08.208
- Take this.
- Nah. You ain't gotta pay
me.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.458
It's a dreamcatcher.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.583
'My mom gave it to me.'

34:14.875 --> 34:16.291
It's yours now.

34:17.458 --> 34:20.917
So you can get home, too.

34:32.166 --> 34:34.250
I took her home that night.

34:37.041 --> 34:38.709
And the next
day
she was dead.

34:39.875 --> 34:43.125
That necklace,
she gave it to
Skill?

34:43.208 --> 34:45.667
Then how did Toomey
end up with it?

34:48.250 --> 34:50.834
Michael, you're sure that
Skill had that gun on him?

34:50.917 --> 34:53.125
He told Madison
he was giving up on dealing.

34:53.208 --> 34:56.917
- And that he'd sell it.
- Sell it to who?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.834
- To some white guy.
- What white guy?

34:58.917 --> 35:01.083
Somebody that brought
her to the house.

35:02.041 --> 35:03.208
Gibby?

35:09.875 --> 35:13.709
(Toomey)
Come on now. Why you gotta get
all po-po on ol' Toomey?

35:16.041 --> 35:17.875
Sit down.

35:17.959 --> 35:19.417
Okay.

35:20.917 --> 35:23.750
Where'd you get
that necklace, Toomey?

35:23.834 --> 35:25.458
One on your cart?

35:25.542 --> 35:27.166
Dumpster, I don't know.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.250
You been lyin' to me
from the get-go.

35:29.333 --> 35:31.709
Come on, baby girl,
Toomey don't play like
that.

35:31.792 --> 35:35.667
Don't "baby girl" me,
you two-bit junkie liar.

35:38.625 --> 35:40.667
So it's like
that
now, huh?

35:40.750 --> 35:42.083
Straight up.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.375
Talk about where you got
that piece of junk necklace.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.291
It ain't a piece of junk!

35:50.125 --> 35:51.542
It's a dreamcatcher.

35:52.834 --> 35:54.834
Dreamcatcher, huh?

35:54.917 --> 35:57.875
We all got dreams,
baby girl.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.000
You think I planned this?

36:03.083 --> 36:06.750
Pushin' that cart, even
the clunkheads laughin' at me?

36:06.834 --> 36:09.125
Wasn't supposed to
be like this.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.083
Skill gave you respect.

36:13.166 --> 36:15.625
- It's payback time.
- Please.

36:15.709 --> 36:17.959
He like all
the rest in the
end.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.166
What'd he do
to you, Toomey?

36:23.083 --> 36:27.333
He looked at me the way
you lookin' at me right
now.

36:27.417 --> 36:29.208
Like I wasn't a man.

36:34.417 --> 36:36.875
"But to whom can I
be responsible

36:36.959 --> 36:39.333
when you refuse to see me?"

36:45.583 --> 36:47.000
You like my piece, Skill?

36:47.792 --> 36:49.917
Ol' Toomey be packin'.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.291
Where you get that?

36:51.375 --> 36:53.250
Dumpster,
behind the
bodega.

36:53.333 --> 36:55.875
Say we trade it
for some vials?

36:55.959 --> 36:57.291
Gave it up for good.

36:57.375 --> 36:58.667
Slingin'.

37:00.875 --> 37:02.375
Dreamcatcher.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.291
Gotta think bigger dreams
than that, man.

37:04.375 --> 37:06.083
Look around, boy.

37:06.166 --> 37:08.792
Streets paved
with
all sorts of
dreams.

37:08.875 --> 37:10.250
Come on, Toomey,
hurting here.

37:10.333 --> 37:12.000
I ain't invisible.

37:12.083 --> 37:13.417
Ain't gonna end like
this for me.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.875
You think you better
than
this or somethin'?

37:15.959 --> 37:18.500
I can't end up
like you, Toomey.

37:18.583 --> 37:19.959
Like me?

37:20.041 --> 37:21.291
What you talkin' about?

37:21.375 --> 37:23.875
I mean,
look at you, man.

37:24.875 --> 37:26.333
Look at you.

37:34.542 --> 37:36.625
Then what happened, Toomey?

37:41.583 --> 37:43.625
- I've been here for hours.
- Like we care.

37:43.709 --> 37:45.917
I'm not some dumb hood
from the ghetto.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.333
No, you're some dumb ass
whose daddy

37:47.417 --> 37:49.709
can't bail him
out for murder.

37:49.792 --> 37:51.792
- I want my lawyer.
- Are you sure?

37:51.875 --> 37:54.000
- Take a few hours.
- Maybe we lose your paperwork.

37:54.083 --> 37:57.208
Let you ride it out in
lock-up over the weekend.

37:57.291 --> 37:59.792
Oh, guys down
there'd
love to test drive

37:59.875 --> 38:01.208
that Chestnut Hill smile.

38:01.291 --> 38:02.875
'We know about
the gun, Gibby.'

38:02.959 --> 38:05.166
- How you bought it off Skill.
- Same gun that killed Madison.

38:05.250 --> 38:08.000
I never bought some stupid
Glock off that hood.

38:10.583 --> 38:12.959
Never said it was a Glock.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.709
I don't have to listen
to this crap.

38:14.792 --> 38:15.917
You're the
worst
kinda scum.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.542
Selling drugs to
kids
to get laid?

38:17.625 --> 38:18.959
You think it's
some
sorta video game?

38:19.041 --> 38:20.417
You can't touch me.
That's police brutality.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.750
On a second
thought,
get over here.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.250
You wanna get laid?

38:24.333 --> 38:25.917
Cons will rip a kiddie
pusher
like you in two.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.375
- Don't put me down there!
- Start talkin'.

38:27.458 --> 38:28.709
Maybe we work something
out with the DA.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.500
Nah, nah, nah,
no deals, no
way.

38:30.583 --> 38:34.375
- Justice time for you, Gibby.
- I'll talk, okay, I'll talk!

38:40.208 --> 38:42.458
Look, I didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

38:43.959 --> 38:46.417
Why'd you kill her, Gibby?

38:46.500 --> 38:47.959
Talk.

38:50.041 --> 38:53.208
I just wanted to be cool.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.458
I mean, I was Tony Montana,
you know?

38:57.917 --> 39:00.458
She was gonna take
that all away.

39:10.667 --> 39:12.667
Take a look at
my lil' friend.

39:13.667 --> 39:14.792
Get away from me!

39:14.875 --> 39:16.417
Keep your voice
down,
you moron.

39:16.500 --> 39:19.166
You're nothing but
a stupid drug dealer!

39:19.250 --> 39:20.583
At least my mom's
not a methhead.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.083
I'm gonna tell the cops
what you did.

39:22.166 --> 39:24.917
Newsflash, girlfriend, rich
kids
like me don't do jail.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.250
You'll still get kicked
outta school.

39:26.333 --> 39:28.000
Lose all your stupid friends.

39:28.083 --> 39:30.792
You know, the only reason
people
like you is 'cause you deal!

39:30.875 --> 39:32.375
Wanna say that again, bitch?

39:34.375 --> 39:35.583
Look at me, huh?

39:38.333 --> 39:39.458
Look at me?

39:41.917 --> 39:43.625
Look at you, boy.

39:43.709 --> 39:47.458
Toomey, this ain't gonna change
who you are, man.

39:48.667 --> 39:50.208
You wanna bet?

40:02.500 --> 40:05.291
- Say it again, loser.
- You're the loser, not me.

40:05.375 --> 40:07.333
- Shut up.
- You're worse than an addict.

40:07.417 --> 40:08.375
I told you to shut up!

40:08.458 --> 40:09.834
Everybody laughs
behind your back

40:09.917 --> 40:10.959
'cause you're a joke!

40:32.000 --> 40:33.166
Oh!

40:33.250 --> 40:34.208
Help!

40:34.291 --> 40:37.500
Somebody! Help!

40:37.583 --> 40:39.417
Oh, okay, okay.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.750
Look at me, look at me.

40:40.834 --> 40:42.250
Keep looking at me,
right here.

40:42.333 --> 40:43.375
Right here, look at me.

40:43.458 --> 40:45.375
Look at me, look at me!

40:45.458 --> 40:46.583
Look at me.
