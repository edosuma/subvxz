00:13.805 --> 00:17.517
Do you have any idea
how much pain you've caused me?

00:18.351 --> 00:19.310
I trusted you...

00:20.311 --> 00:21.396
like family.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.107
Who are you?

00:24.733 --> 00:26.484
Tell me who you're working with.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.657
The girl.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.701
- No.
-  Sarah!

00:34.701 --> 00:36.327
Stay back. Get back.

00:36.327 --> 00:39.706
Tell me, or I put a bullet
where you don't want one to go.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.625
-  Mommy!
- And it'll be your own doing, not mine.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.502
You would hurt a little child?

00:44.502 --> 00:47.255
You're a coward, just like your father.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.090
My father was a brave man.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.968
A great man. My father--

00:51.968 --> 00:55.472
Was begging me for his life
before I threw him off that cliff.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.933
I knew you were stupid, but my God...

00:58.933 --> 01:02.353
A terrain you walked
a thousand times, firm soil,

01:02.353 --> 01:05.523
then all of a sudden,
the earth gave away on the ridge?

01:05.523 --> 01:06.691
Bullshit.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.402
I held him by his collar over the edge.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.905
He was crying like a little baby.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.782
He was begging me for his life.

01:14.783 --> 01:15.992
Even pissed himself.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.452
I will torture you all!

01:17.994 --> 01:20.455
The women, this child,

01:20.455 --> 01:23.416
days of agony until I tire of it!

01:25.168 --> 01:26.044
I'm stupid?

01:26.795 --> 01:29.339
Why in God's name
would you tell me what you did?

01:29.923 --> 01:30.757
To buy time.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.096
Go!

01:50.151 --> 01:51.194
Go!

01:55.448 --> 01:56.407
Whoo!

01:57.283 --> 01:58.368
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:03.123 --> 02:03.957
Ah!

02:08.586 --> 02:09.587
You better run!

02:12.090 --> 02:13.550
The power!

02:13.550 --> 02:15.176
Oh no!

02:35.155 --> 02:35.989
Thanks.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.450
Highest marksmanship score in my class.

02:54.090 --> 02:54.924
No.

02:57.635 --> 03:01.222
Take the assignment or take termination.
Your call.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.684
All due respect, Director,
this is a huge mistake.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.855
He doesn't listen to me.
He doesn't respect me as an officer.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.273
He sees me as a kid.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.569
This will only hurt the case
I've been working for a year now.

03:16.029 --> 03:16.863
Tell her.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.908
Your father knows Boro's history.
You know Boro's present.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.160
He's not giving up on
this WMD dream of his.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.745
You two working together

03:23.745 --> 03:26.372
increases our chance of finding Boro
when he raises his head again.

03:26.956 --> 03:30.293
And truthfully,
I think this'd be good for both of you.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.128
Judas.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.672
Can't believe I took your name
at my confirmation.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.009
Emma Bartholomina Brunner,
you take that back.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.101
Uncalled for.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.646
I was a great godfather,
and I'm not even Italian.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.448
I had a retirement plan.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.283
We had a plan too,

04:02.909 --> 04:04.202
to capture Boro.

04:04.827 --> 04:05.828
But now he's in the wind,

04:05.828 --> 04:09.082
and the best way to run him down
is for you both to work together.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.458
I don't know if we can.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.710
Emma's very good. You saw that.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.089
She's fearless.
She's got incredible instincts.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.216
She really could be
one of the best we've ever had.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.259
But she's your kid,

04:20.051 --> 04:24.681
so that means she also takes stupid risks,
she's hot-headed, thick-headed,

04:24.681 --> 04:26.808
thinks she can do everything by herself.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.643
Maybe working with you

04:28.643 --> 04:31.479
has the side benefit
of helping her develop as an operative.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.358
Honestly, Luke, she scares me sometimes.

04:35.358 --> 04:39.362
Come on, all young field officers
are kind of cocky.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.405
Not like her.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.572
We contacted her last week

04:41.572 --> 04:44.242
to let her know there were whispers
things were going sideways,

04:44.242 --> 04:45.994
she should pull out of Guyana.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.453
She refused.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.831
She said she was gathering great intel.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.916
She was too close
to getting the nuke out of there.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.168
We didn't lose communication
with her, Luke.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.254
She turned off her comms,

04:56.254 --> 04:59.257
insubordination
that could have resulted in you

04:59.257 --> 05:01.676
and her and three other officers
being killed.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.387
We need her on this case,
but not on her own.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.764
I want you to lead the team
to go after Boro.

05:06.764 --> 05:10.226
You, Emma, Barry, Aldon, Roo.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.478
I don't think this is gonna work.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.981
I feel like I don't even know her anymore.

05:15.481 --> 05:19.402
What better way to learn
than by saving the world together?

05:31.622 --> 05:32.874
All right.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.294
Oh, Barry,

05:36.794 --> 05:38.546
don't go into the field again.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.506
You could have gotten hurt.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.927
See? I knew we were still friends.

05:46.929 --> 05:47.764
Say it.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.143
Say we still friends.

05:55.980 --> 05:56.814
How are you feeling?

05:56.814 --> 05:59.359
It's just a graze.
Sling will be gone tomorrow.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.985
I'm talking about us working together.

06:00.985 --> 06:01.903
Oh.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.197
That feels worse than the gunshot.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.615
What is your problem?

06:05.615 --> 06:06.741
You are.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.868
I can't trust you anymore,
and I have to work with you.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.453
Well, I can't trust you.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.746
I mean, who are you?

06:11.746 --> 06:13.956
Did you even like
the Sunday Funday bake-offs?

06:13.956 --> 06:16.250
- Sometimes. Sometimes I hated them.
- Oh.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.504
I was pretending for so long,
I can't even remember anymore.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.590
And, you know, the only place
I didn't have to perform was work,

06:22.590 --> 06:25.510
but now here you are,
and you've ruined my only escape.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.221
What about you? What was real about you?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.598
Well, for one, my retirement.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.600
I was supposed to be done
with all of this.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.144
I was supposed to get my ship
and your mom back.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.855
You actually thought that would happen?

06:37.855 --> 06:38.815
Well, I had a shot.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.152
Right. Okay, sure.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.655
Just do me a favor.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.408
I've been working Boro a long time.

06:49.158 --> 06:51.411
Don't screw up this case
the way you screwed up our family.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.580
I can't believe this.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.810
Pickle's in the pantry?

07:15.810 --> 07:18.896
Jelly is almost in the jar.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.692
- But I gotta say, I wish it wasn't.
- Why?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.735
'Cause jelly is sticky,
and sticky is messy,

07:24.735 --> 07:27.405
and messy is a problem
when you're committing a crime.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.865
I would not do well in prison.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.701
You would make a lot of friends
in prison. Trust me.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.870
- That's not funny.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.956
Okay, we're almost connected to the Wi-Fi.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.250
Let's just hope he left his laptop open.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.587
Is that his mail?

07:42.587 --> 07:43.504
No.

07:43.504 --> 07:46.299
It says "Donatello Luna" right on it.
You promised one felony.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.425
<i>Hosenscheisser.</i>

07:47.425 --> 07:49.427
It's only a felony if you open it.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.973
He's paying for Cinemax?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.142
I knew he was a pervert.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.728
It's not just Skinemax now.
It's quality programming.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.314
What do you know about that?
You only watch cartoons.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.567
I know I got a call
from our pal in MI6 today.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.778
No chatter from Boro,
waiting to hear from the Australians,

08:07.778 --> 08:09.447
but so far no sign of him.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.490
- Oh!

08:10.490 --> 08:13.826
We are in, and his laptop is open.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.329
Operation Don Juan is a go.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.289

08:36.390 --> 08:40.645
How can a woman that was married
to a guy like me date such a schmuck?

08:40.645 --> 08:42.563
Tally also has a temper.

08:42.563 --> 08:46.359
She find out we spying on her boyfriend,
I'm selling your Austrian butt downriver.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.735
I was never here.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.737
You're just trying to protect the family.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.531
We know nothing about this guy.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.032
He could be a creep.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.244
And what if he's a creep
that wants to harm Tally?

08:57.286 --> 09:00.039
Okay, let's KGB him.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.585
<i>Hey, Oscar. What's up, kid?</i>

09:04.585 --> 09:06.504
Why is my son calling this schmuck?

09:06.504 --> 09:08.506
<i>I am 100% serious.</i>

09:08.506 --> 09:11.467
<i>I think MyAisles is a fantastic idea,</i>

09:11.467 --> 09:15.221
<i>and I just hope my investment
will help you get it off the ground, pal.</i>

09:15.221 --> 09:17.932
He's investing in my son's stupid app?

09:17.932 --> 09:20.017
I mean,
this guy is dumber than I thought he is.

09:20.017 --> 09:23.104
He's not dumb.
He's scoring brownie points from Mrs. B.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.023
- He's trying to cuckold me.
- That's definitely not what I was saying.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.192
Well, he's trying to use my son
to cuckold me.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.819
I don't think it means what you think.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.112
It comes from the cuckoo bird.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.531
When one bird takes over
another bird's family.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.742
There are a thousand online videos
that would definitely disagree with you.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.370
<i>Okay. See you at family dinner tonight.</i>

09:39.370 --> 09:41.330
I wasn't even invited to the dinner.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.832
I mean, he's trying to replace me.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.293
He's cuckolding the entire family.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.336
Please stop saying that.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.926
Meeting has been moved up.
We have to go to HQ. Let's go.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.846
We're dropping these
at Donnie's mailbox on the way.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.223
Goody two-shoes.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.725
-  What?
- Nothing.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.982
So the doctor said,
yeah, got full range of motion

10:07.982 --> 10:10.026
and probably shouldn't even scar.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.944
That's great.
I'm glad you're okay.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.362
Here's my question.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.407
How the heck did a donkey kick that high?

10:16.407 --> 10:17.325
It's...

10:17.825 --> 10:19.827
- I don't know. Hell of a kick though.
- Mm.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.662
- Giants should sign him.

10:21.662 --> 10:25.416
Well, listen, I've got the perfect
R & R day set for you.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.877
This kid here made my mother's gazpacho,

10:27.877 --> 10:32.381
and I also just downloaded
some very, very rare Lee Fields tracks

10:32.381 --> 10:34.675
that were recorded out in a church.

10:34.675 --> 10:35.760
That sounds amazing.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.262
- Agreed.
- That's... so fun.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.182
- Um, I had an idea.
- Lay it on me.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.226
Okay. So I heard about this escape room

10:44.226 --> 10:47.063
where they hook up
small battery packs to you,

10:47.063 --> 10:50.358
and if you don't get out in time,
they send you a little shock.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.193
But it doesn't hurt. It just--

10:52.193 --> 10:54.278
I don't know,
It just makes it so much more...

10:54.278 --> 10:55.237
Terrifying.

10:55.946 --> 10:59.033
I don't know if that seems like
an "us" activity, maybe.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.829
Um, but speaking of us,
I'm teaching my kids about Rube Goldberg,

11:03.829 --> 11:07.750
and I enlisted their aid,
got them to help me build...

11:07.750 --> 11:08.668
Oh!

11:08.668 --> 11:12.129
...something for us.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.091
- Ta-da.
-  This is amazing.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.593
Crazy, eh? So here, um,

11:19.095 --> 11:20.429
put the marble in the funnel.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.767
In-- In here? Okay.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.897
Yeah.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.692
- Yeah, yes. And...

11:34.735 --> 11:37.071
- Yeah!

11:37.071 --> 11:38.864
- Yeah!
- I love it.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.491
I love you.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.286
Your father.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.499
- Not what I'm thinking about right now.
- No, I just saw your father.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.169
Probably just dropping off gym equipment.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.547
It's work. I gotta go.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.258
Okay. Um, what time do you wanna
pick me up tomorrow?

11:57.758 --> 11:58.801
For what?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.219
<i>Antiques Roadshow.</i>

12:00.803 --> 12:02.972
Oh yeah. No, I'm sorry, um,

12:03.639 --> 12:04.765
I lost track of days.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.852
Um, tomorrow.
Can we talk about it tonight?

12:08.853 --> 12:10.479
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay. Okay.

12:10.479 --> 12:13.232
- It'll be so great. I'm really excited.
- Yeah, same.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.275
- All right.
- Love you.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.735
All right, bye-bye. See ya.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.573
All that work
for just that... three seconds.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.288
Premium wax.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.903
<i>Identities authenticated.</i>

12:58.903 --> 13:01.030
<i>Welcome, Officer Luke Brunner.</i>

13:01.030 --> 13:02.990
<i>Welcome, Officer Bartholomew Putt.</i>

13:02.990 --> 13:04.867
<i>You are currently 0.4 miles</i>

13:04.867 --> 13:08.037
<i>from the CIA regional office
subterranean entrance.</i>

13:09.914 --> 13:13.042
Hey, what were you two doing
in Donatello's neighborhood?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.503
- Well, good morning to you too.
<i>-</i> Answer the question.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.297
Keeping up our cover,
delivering gym equipment.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.465
In your car?

13:19.465 --> 13:21.675
Why? It was just a box
of resistance bands.

13:21.675 --> 13:22.927
I don't need a truck for that.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.888
Is that true, Uncle Barry?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.140
It's absolutely true.

13:37.024 --> 13:40.528
You don't need a truck
to deliver a box of resistance bands.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.532
- How about that? Oh.
- Oh, the pugilists have entered the ring.

13:47.743 --> 13:48.786
This is my seat.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.037
Since when?

13:50.037 --> 13:52.498
Since every briefing
I've ever had in this room.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.791
Well, me too.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.377
Take Your Daughter to Work Day
is going well.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.675
Sit. Everyone.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.803
Now.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.938
Oh, did Luke Brunner just back down?

14:15.938 --> 14:18.357
I don't think I like this young lady.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.236
After you took the nuclear device
from Lape Pa Lanmo,

14:22.236 --> 14:23.904
they scattered like roaches.

14:23.904 --> 14:27.324
We tracked Boro's seaplane
taking off from Port Georgetown,

14:27.324 --> 14:30.536
but we lost him when he flew into a storm
west of Puerto Rico.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.788
So Boro sleeps with the fishes.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.582
- No.
- That's what he wants us to think.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.292
He figured we'd track his plane.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.503
- He intentionally flies into a storm.
-  Then turns his transponder off.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.171
So that we'd believe he crashed.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.507
Knowing we'd know an airplane that small

14:43.507 --> 14:46.302
wouldn't leave a debris field big enough
for us to find him.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.389
Like the CIA, Boro hires the best pilots.
He's still alive.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.849
We think so too.

14:56.186 --> 15:02.818
Based on the average rate of speed
of a single-engine aircraft,

15:02.818 --> 15:05.029
its fuel consumption,

15:05.613 --> 15:08.866
factoring in weather conditions

15:08.866 --> 15:13.662
that increase drag
and reduce aeronautic efficiencies,

15:13.662 --> 15:15.998
his first refuel
would have been in this area.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.959
And if he wanted to avoid the storm,
which was moving westerly,

15:18.959 --> 15:21.754
he's headed in this direction here.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.175
It's simple math and a wiener.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.808
- You just have to pump it up.
- I am pumping it.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.310
You have to pump it harder.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.312
That's what she said.
That's the name of my porno.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.730
That's what I told my doctor.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.983
Monet had his watercolors,
you have your double entendres.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.652
-  Dad, I've got it.
- I can fix it.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.779
- I know what I'm doing.
- Almost there.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.118
May we continue?

15:54.703 --> 15:56.455
- Sorry.
- Sorry, Director.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.041
We've been working with our allies
in an attempt

15:59.041 --> 16:01.877
to find and free Lape Pa Lanmo's
substantial assets,

16:01.877 --> 16:03.796
to cripple their ability to operate.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.255
We have to do more than that.

16:05.255 --> 16:09.218
It's very clear that Boro's driving need
is to live up to his father's legacy.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.053
He even told me that himself
at the compound.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.304
Wrong.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.723
This is all about ego.
Boro can't lose face.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.351
Can't lose even a drop
of the power he's amassed.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.062
Not everything a child does
is about their father.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.691
Well, whatever his motivation,
Boro is moving forward.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.818
- Tina?

16:25.818 --> 16:29.363
This is Tina Mukerji,
an analyst on loan from the NSA.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.032
First of all,
an honor to be working with you.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.242
Kiss-ass.

16:34.159 --> 16:39.248
Well, we've been picking up some chatter
that, uh, Boro's nuke auction is still on.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.250
But we have the device.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.794
That's right. So we can only assume--

16:43.794 --> 16:46.672
He's gonna make a new one... and do it fast.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.299
His ego won't let him sit
on a loss for long,

16:49.299 --> 16:51.510
especially with all of Lape Pa Lanmo

16:51.510 --> 16:53.721
waiting to see what he does next
after Guyana.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.723
But how can he possibly accomplish this?

16:55.723 --> 16:57.683
Fissionable nuclear material
is well protected

16:57.683 --> 16:59.977
and extremely difficult to come by.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.396
It's not like you can get it
at a Duane Reade.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.064
Boro will find a way.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.066
- He's very tenacious.
- Obsessed.

17:06.066 --> 17:09.194
If he cannot find anything fissionable,
he will pivot.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.113
Steal something less protected.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.990
Like radioactive waste, maybe.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.825
That's a possibility,

17:15.325 --> 17:18.245
but how does he assimilate that
into a suitcase nuke?

17:18.245 --> 17:19.163
Who knows?

17:19.163 --> 17:22.332
But I've seen him work.
He's a brilliant problem solver.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.375
Wharton-trained.

17:23.959 --> 17:28.922
Yeah. I'd hate to be the guy dumb enough
to have paid for that education.

17:29.506 --> 17:33.594
Following up on Roo's theory,
if he's heading in this direction--

17:33.594 --> 17:36.764
We focus on Eastern Europe
and Central Asia.

17:36.764 --> 17:40.184
They have less regulations
for how radioactive waste is handled.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.019
Former Soviet Bloc countries.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.731
Places difficult for us to get to
and places where he feels safe.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.940
Tina, you're on it.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.277
Yes, Ms. Mukerji will be joining us.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.280
NSA's been hunting Boro as well,
and we're pooling resources.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.365
- Man.
- Okay, that's it.

17:55.365 --> 17:56.450
You're dismissed,

17:57.534 --> 18:00.329
unless your name is Brunner.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.628
Can't believe we have to work
with the NSA.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.755
NSA, Never Solve Anything.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.340
Nerds Suck Ass.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.133
I don't know. She seems okay.

18:14.927 --> 18:20.516
Don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.233
You can't just give him authority
over my case.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.152
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell are you talking about?

18:32.152 --> 18:34.488
I've been working undercover for 40 years.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.823
No one gives me anything.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.700
I get it the old-fashioned way. I earn it.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.911
Your father has more
field experience than you.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.955
He's the logical choice
to command the team.

18:42.955 --> 18:47.126
I told you, he treats me like a child.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.919
How are we supposed to work together?

18:48.919 --> 18:51.547
That's a reasonable question.
Here's your answer.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.342
Operational psychologist,
Dr. Louis Pfeffer.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.971
I called him in from D.C.
to be in-house analyst on the Boro matter,

18:58.971 --> 19:01.515
and to work with the two of you
in particular.

19:01.515 --> 19:05.561
He will be conducting your mandatory
joint therapy sessions.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.813
- Absolutely not.
- No. No way.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.189
It's not up for debate.

19:09.189 --> 19:13.569
The two of you spent most of your time
in Guyana at each other's throats.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.154
You barely got out of there alive.

19:15.821 --> 19:20.159
If the two of you are gonna work together,
you need to be able to work together.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.787
And I don't mean some of the time.
I mean all of the time.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.707
I know you're not thrilled,
but I assure you, you need my help.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.584
Please, you don't even know us.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.586
Sure about that?

19:30.586 --> 19:33.630
I knew neither of you would back down
over the faulty chair I planted.

19:34.214 --> 19:38.260
Also knew that your pathologies
would play out exactly as they did.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.804
You wouldn't accept help from your father
even though you needed it.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.140
And you were so intent
on solving the problem,

19:43.140 --> 19:46.185
you didn't listen to her telling you
that she needed to solve it herself.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.770
You both complement each other
incredibly well.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.190
I just saw the two of you
break down scenarios rapid fire.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.441
You're both of the same mind

19:52.441 --> 19:54.359
because you're drawn in
by the facts of the case

19:54.359 --> 19:56.153
when you forgot about egos.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.239
Your dynamic is written about extensively
in my predictive paper.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.120
Oh.

20:06.121 --> 20:09.833
Now "Pfeiffer," isn't the correct
German pronunciation Pfeffer?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.253
When my grandparents came over,
they Americanized it.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.296
- Oh.
- Mm.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.382
Well, then in English,
it would actually be called "Pepper."

20:17.382 --> 20:20.010
So maybe you should be called Dr. Pepper.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.888
Yes, and I've heard all the jokes.

20:22.888 --> 20:27.267
I'm not gonna make jokes about your name,
but we're gonna crush the therapy session.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.479
Together, I think we can climb
this mountain. Do you?

20:30.479 --> 20:31.813
I see what you're doing.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.566
You're inserting soda names
into the conversation.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.110
I have no idea
what the hell you're talking about.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.948
You must be fanta-sizing.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.576
Shasta.

20:48.872 --> 20:51.792
This will be difficult.
They're both dickheads.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.254
Yeah, we've seriously
never missed an episode.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.755
It's true. We play along.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.548
How do you play <i>Antiques Roadshow</i>?

20:58.548 --> 21:00.050
- Guess the appraisal.
- Oh.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.719
Yeah, it's basically like
a thinking man's <i>Price is Right</i>.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.013
You learn history, art, science.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.516
I... I actually use it to teach my students.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.600
Very innovative, Carter.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.686
- Those kids are lucky to have you.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.187
- Thank you.
- I got it.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.606
So how long is the show in town for?

21:14.606 --> 21:15.816
One day only.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.526
I'm gonna take my Nana Pat's clock.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.612
It needs to be re-stained,
but aside from that, it's perfect.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.697
Hm.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.743
What are you doing here?

21:26.743 --> 21:28.370
I needed to get something.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.664
Uh, yeah, a clue.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.375
You can't just barge in here,
especially now, given our situation.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.502
If any of them
were to pick up on anything--

21:35.502 --> 21:38.338
No one is gonna pick up anything from me.
I'm a professional.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.425
For the record,
I told him this was a bad idea.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.302
Do I hear Luke?

21:46.805 --> 21:49.099
Daddy's here.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.101
-  Oh yay.
- Well, hello, family.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.811
-  Hi.
- Oh.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.229
- Hi, Tally. How are you?
- Hey.

21:54.229 --> 21:55.939
So good to see you.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.694
- Donald.
- Donatello, actually. But Donnie's great.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.112
Been a while.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.324
That's quite a handshake you have, Luke.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.784
I knew you sold gym equipment,
didn't know you used it.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.370
Gotta get on a program myself.

22:10.871 --> 22:14.041
Well, just come by the shop.
I'll put you through the wringer.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.877
- Donnie. It is good to see you again.
-  Barry.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.046
This reminds me. I got something for you.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.298
What are you doing here?

22:22.132 --> 22:23.925
Just borrowing the table saw.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.218
Sandy, how are you?

22:25.218 --> 22:26.970
-  All good.
- It's so good to see you.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.264
-  Good to see you.
- Oh, look at this. Oscar.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.851
Hello, my darling.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.145
- Hi, Pee-Pa.
- Hey.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.022
You're not finishing your food?

22:37.022 --> 22:39.399
This is Grandma's special lasagna.

22:39.399 --> 22:42.861
Yeah, she's just beat from school.
Kid comes home wiped out, don't ya?

22:42.861 --> 22:45.322
I'm fluffin' tired.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.451
- What?
- I'm sorry, what did you say?

22:49.451 --> 22:52.204
Oh, nothing. It's just that
I jammed my toe the other day,

22:52.204 --> 22:54.039
and I said, "My fluffin' toe."

22:54.748 --> 22:57.959
It's just I didn't want to say
the other word in front of her, you know?

22:57.959 --> 23:00.003
They shouldn't grow up with bad language.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.589
I hate when young ladies... curse.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.760
Kind of late in the day, isn't it?

23:07.260 --> 23:10.097
So weird you need a table saw right now.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.473
Well--

23:11.473 --> 23:13.642
Actually...

23:13.642 --> 23:15.143
...I need it.

23:15.143 --> 23:19.940
I am building a life-size... Boba Fett lamp.

23:20.899 --> 23:21.733
Oh.

23:21.733 --> 23:22.651
Big.

23:22.651 --> 23:26.405
Speaking of building things,
Oscar, how's your app coming along?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.740
Great. Don's investing.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.534
If you stay on the sidelines,
you'll miss out.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.911
Yeah, bankruptcy.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.414
Okay, Barry, here you go.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.916
Ice cream cupcakes with crunchies.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.710
- Seriously?
- Yeah. I--

23:40.710 --> 23:43.964
I was at the supermarket the other day.
I saw them and thought of you.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.716
I said, "I'll pop 'em in the freezer
till the next time you come over."

23:46.716 --> 23:50.053
Well, Barry actually has
a heart condition,

23:50.720 --> 23:53.598
and this would kill him.

23:54.182 --> 23:57.727
Don't worry, there's a homeless guy
living right down the street from me.

23:57.727 --> 23:59.104
He's always hungry.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.689
Luke, can I talk to you?

24:00.689 --> 24:03.233
- Of course.
-  Good. Come.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.318
It's the thought that counts, right?

24:08.697 --> 24:10.031
Would you wanna stay?

24:10.031 --> 24:11.616
Are you kidding me?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.535
I love your lasagna.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.329
Fine. Then just be honest

24:16.329 --> 24:18.874
and admit you didn't come here
for the table saw.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.899
Son of a bitch
is cuckolding my entire family.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.693
Now he's using your stupid cupcakes
to cuckold you too.

24:46.693 --> 24:49.863
When you look it up online,
you gonna be really upset with yourself.

24:54.367 --> 24:55.452
Man...

24:55.452 --> 24:57.370
Just put the tracker on his car.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.333
"Put the tracker on his car."

25:06.796 --> 25:07.672
Put these on.

25:08.423 --> 25:11.134
- What kind of a therapy is this?
- The mandated kind.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.429
My techniques are untraditional
but effective. Trust me.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.269
Good.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.188
Zip.

25:23.939 --> 25:25.273
You have to zip it.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.025
All the way.

25:28.610 --> 25:29.611
Wonderful.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.530
Now hug each other.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.741
If I don't sign a paper

25:34.741 --> 25:37.118
saying you completed this session
to the best of your abilities,

25:37.118 --> 25:38.954
you'll both get a desk in the basement

25:38.954 --> 25:41.122
responding to
Freedom of Information requests.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.040
Now hug.

25:55.679 --> 25:56.930
You can't, can you?

25:56.930 --> 25:58.598
Electromagnets in the vest.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.934
Like polarities are repelling you.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.936
I'm gonna need to see your diploma.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.313
I have a PhD from Yale
and a BS from Stanford.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.607
Well, we can guess what the BS stands for.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.276
The vests are a metaphor.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.444
You're both stubborn and intractable.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.738
Your like personalities are repelling you.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.491
But if you just let all that go...

26:18.076 --> 26:20.579
Stuck together like tacos and Tuesday.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.372
This is beyond stupid.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.957
This is your homework.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.959
I want you to wear the vest
for ten minutes a day.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.877
Look into each other's eyes,

26:27.877 --> 26:30.547
and listen to what each other has to say.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.215
There's no getting away.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.842
There's no avoidance.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.343
Start now.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.725
Tina found something.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.518
Yep, gotta go.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.564
Thank you. I feel so much better.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.025
Don't forget to sign the paper.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.737
Turns out Central Asia's the play.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.071
Tina?

26:55.655 --> 26:58.533
A source spotted Boro's
right-hand man, Cain Khan.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.909
I can't hear you.

27:01.870 --> 27:05.081
Cain Khan, uh,
he arrived in Kazakhstan yesterday,

27:05.081 --> 27:09.002
two days before nuclear waste
from the AHTR reactor

27:09.002 --> 27:11.630
is scheduled to be moved via train
to long-term storage.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.922
What's the material?

27:13.506 --> 27:14.424
Cesium 137.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.843
- Oh boy.
- How much are we talking about?

27:17.427 --> 27:18.511
Tanker-car full.

27:18.511 --> 27:21.181
Enough to make a major city
glow in the dark for a few dozen years.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.308
And they're transporting it by rail?

27:23.308 --> 27:27.395
High-speed maglev to be precise.
We helped them build it.

27:27.395 --> 27:31.566
Congress sold it as a friendship train
to repair relations between our countries.

27:31.566 --> 27:32.859
And how did that go?

27:32.859 --> 27:34.361
Well, they still hate us.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.528
Fluff them.

27:37.030 --> 27:37.906
Barry told us.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.992
They're putting nuclear waste
on a bullet train?

27:40.992 --> 27:42.786
Actually it's safer.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.580
Maglev trains
are nearly impossible to derail

27:45.580 --> 27:46.915
because of the repel factor.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.918
Further the train moves from the track,
the stronger it's pushed back,

27:49.918 --> 27:51.753
creating a consistent stasis.

27:51.753 --> 27:55.090
Assuming Boro's guys are gonna hit it,
how would they do it?

27:55.090 --> 27:58.218
Security is tight loading and unloading.
It'll have to be en route.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.844
Okay, so the great bullet train robbery.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.180
How do you stick up a train
that's going 150 miles per hour?

28:02.180 --> 28:03.390
You don't.

28:04.432 --> 28:05.433
You stop it.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.396
Right here at this bend
through the Kazakh hills.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.189
A perfect choke point.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.440
Stop the train,

28:12.440 --> 28:16.069
suck the waste into a tanker truck,
and they're gone in minutes.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.696
Okay. Okay.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.657
So to prevent that from happening,

28:20.657 --> 28:24.160
we'll put Luke and Emma undercover
as passengers on the train.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.663
Passengers on a train with nuclear waste?

28:26.663 --> 28:29.165
It's not uncommon.
Britain does it all the time.

28:30.250 --> 28:34.379
Conductor in the front, tanker behind,
passenger cars the rest of the way.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.422
Miss Russell and I?

28:35.422 --> 28:37.173
There's a depot at the end of the line.

28:37.173 --> 28:39.718
The train's emergency shutoff
is located there.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.512
That's how we think Boro
might get the train to stop.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.723
Good chance with an inside man.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.100
So you will go on as US inspectors.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.186
Part of the deal with giving them
the train is periodic oversight.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.104
Copy that.

28:51.104 --> 28:55.108
So Barry and Tina
will quarterback from Merry Fitness.

28:55.108 --> 28:58.319
The rest of you, grab your covers,
grab your gear, head to the plane.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.530
Wheels up at 9:00 p.m.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.532
9:00 p.m.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.159
9:00 p.m.

29:11.708 --> 29:12.834
How's your cover?

29:12.834 --> 29:14.669
Anna Fettisov,

29:15.378 --> 29:18.673
a Kazakh student studying literature
at the Suleyman Demirel University.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.133
Dmitriy Gorchev,

29:21.092 --> 29:24.554
taking the train
to visit my sister in Nur-Sultan,

29:24.554 --> 29:27.640
and gonna go fishing also.

29:28.224 --> 29:29.851
That gum will get you killed.

29:31.978 --> 29:34.272
This is the gum of choice in Kazakhstan.

29:34.272 --> 29:37.192
It was until wildfires
disrupted the supply chain

29:37.192 --> 29:38.985
of the root that's used
to make black licorice,

29:38.985 --> 29:41.988
which drove the price of a pack sky-high.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.284
Only government-connected people
or the very rich would have it.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.368
Get rid of it.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.455
Well, thanks.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.248
That was a great catch.

29:53.708 --> 29:54.584
You're welcome.

29:58.379 --> 29:59.839
I'm gonna take this.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.382
Hey.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.343
Are you on the red-eye yet?

30:03.343 --> 30:06.387
Uh, about to take off. How'd <i>Roadshow</i> go?

30:06.387 --> 30:09.349
Well, Nana Pat's clock's a piece of shit.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.309
It's a reproduction made in the '60s.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.562
I'm sorry, babe.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.398
<i>But, you know,
you weren't gonna sell it anyway.</i>

30:17.398 --> 30:18.316
Yeah, fine,

30:18.316 --> 30:21.861
but she always said it was an antique
passed down through generations.

30:21.861 --> 30:24.030
I mean, it's weird she'd lie about that.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.825
Well, maybe she just wanted
to make it more special for you.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.159
I mean, I guess.

30:28.159 --> 30:31.162
I just-- I don't know,
being lied to by somebody I love,

30:31.162 --> 30:34.749
it's a weird combo meal
of sucky and surprising.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.627
<i>Anyway, good luck in Libya. Love you.</i>

30:38.253 --> 30:40.421
Yeah, love you too.

30:50.723 --> 30:52.350
Are you shittin' me?

30:53.226 --> 30:54.060
What?

30:55.103 --> 30:58.022
Every time, every single time,

30:58.022 --> 31:01.359
you always look like
you stepped out of James Bond's closet,

31:01.359 --> 31:04.487
while I get the Hillary Clinton
Walmart collection.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.656
Oh, come on. You look very sharp.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.199
Thanks, Grandpa.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.869
You got any Werther's Originals
you wanna spare?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.370
What about you, huh?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.081
Think I look sharp?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.465
That's Kazakh for,
"Why the long face, super lady?"

31:25.049 --> 31:27.844
I feel bad. I blew off my boyfriend again.

31:28.761 --> 31:32.265
Well, you know who's upset when I leave
for an op at a moment's notice?

31:33.099 --> 31:33.933
Nobody.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.895
Only way to do this job
is to don't get attached.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.314
I didn't ask for any advice.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.690
No, it's not advice.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.984
Like casual hookups, they work.

31:42.984 --> 31:45.111
But relationships, CIA is tough on 'em.

31:51.576 --> 31:52.577
Tell me about it.

32:42.085 --> 32:42.919
Barry?

32:44.295 --> 32:45.755
Bat's in the belfry?

32:45.755 --> 32:47.215
<i>Honey's in the hive.</i>

32:47.882 --> 32:50.301
Operation Training Day is a go.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.678
Anyone else online yet?

32:51.678 --> 32:54.681
- Ain't nobody here but us chickens.
<i>-</i> <i>Good.</i>

32:54.681 --> 32:56.975
Just want you to multitask, okay?

32:56.975 --> 32:59.769
And keep an eye on Operation Don Juan.

33:00.269 --> 33:01.813
What's Operation Don Juan?

33:03.314 --> 33:05.400
Um, that's classified.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.527
Classified,
or secret 'cause it's about Donatello?

33:08.194 --> 33:10.279
I have other cases besides this one.

33:10.279 --> 33:13.616
Happens to be a Don Juan
who's a gun runner from San Juan.

33:13.616 --> 33:16.869
- Oh.
- It is a... need-to-know basis.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.247
If you don't need, you don't know.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.499
Fine.

33:22.583 --> 33:23.501
Where were you?

33:24.627 --> 33:27.088
Stopped at a kiosk
to buy something for Carter.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.340
Well, that's nice. What did you get him?

33:30.133 --> 33:31.300
It's need-to-know.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.261
Do you have to be that sassy?

33:33.261 --> 33:35.596
I mean, I miss my good girl.

33:35.596 --> 33:38.725
I miss my loser
gym-equipment-salesman dad.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.101
Oh, just do a sweep.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.478
I mean,
Boro maybe has an agent on the train.

33:43.771 --> 33:46.983
Check her out. Combat boots
don't exactly go with the outfit.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.444
But they're terrific
for the cold and the mud.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.070
Maybe she's just practical.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.780
How about the case behind you?

33:54.449 --> 33:56.242
There might be a weapon in there.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.619
Copy that. What about him?

34:00.496 --> 34:02.665
Knuckles are bruised on both hands.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.417
Maybe a hired muscle.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.294
He's eating a BLT.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.379
Ethnic Kazakhs don't eat pork.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.759
- Let's take him out.
- No.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.053
He might be an immigrant.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.930
Or he could be a Boro plant.

34:17.930 --> 34:20.016
Could be, but we have to make sure.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.562
And as leading officer, I say we wait.

34:29.650 --> 34:33.029
-  Who the hell are you?
- Agents Starsky and Hutch.

34:33.029 --> 34:37.158
We're inspectors
with the US State Department.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.077
No need to get up.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.370
You speak English?

34:41.370 --> 34:42.830
-  Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.999
'Cause we're just here
to observe and report.

34:44.999 --> 34:47.460
You know the expression
"you break it, you buy it"?

34:47.460 --> 34:49.712
Well, America has a different expression.

34:49.712 --> 34:52.632
We bought it,
so y'all better not break it.

34:52.632 --> 34:56.094
Now let's see you make this choo-choo
we paid for go chugga-chugga.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.053
It's okay.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.180
Pretend we're not here.
Do your thing,

34:59.180 --> 35:00.723
and make sure the trains run on time.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.228
<i>The train's leaving the station.</i>

35:05.228 --> 35:06.437
Good job.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.234
Oh, check it out. Suit looks like yours.

35:12.151 --> 35:13.736
- Twinsies.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.988
Son of a bitch.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.584
It's funny.

35:29.585 --> 35:30.545
What?

35:31.462 --> 35:32.380
Genetics.

35:33.673 --> 35:36.175
How we both are drawn
to the same line of work.

35:37.176 --> 35:41.222
The Beatles and Flavor Flav
were drawn to the same line of work.

35:42.265 --> 35:43.266
Were they the same?

35:44.350 --> 35:45.184
I guess not.

35:50.022 --> 35:53.317
What is Flavor Flav?

35:58.865 --> 36:00.074
<i>Hey, Tall. What's up?</i>

36:01.450 --> 36:03.035
<i>No, I'm... I'm not doing a thing.</i>

36:06.205 --> 36:08.082
<i>Yeah, I would love to come over.</i>

36:09.458 --> 36:10.293
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:10.877 --> 36:12.128
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

36:12.128 --> 36:14.046
<i>♪ Midday booty call for Donnie Boy ♪</i>

36:14.046 --> 36:15.798
<i>- ♪ Midday booty call ♪
-</i> Oh.

36:15.798 --> 36:16.841
That's not good.

36:17.508 --> 36:18.593
What's not good?

36:18.593 --> 36:21.095
Uh, uh... potato salad.

36:21.095 --> 36:24.807
It's nasty. It's got... raisins in it.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.686
- Showtime.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.356
Game on.
You're approaching the choke point.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.524
Anything that might happen

36:33.524 --> 36:34.901
<i>is gonna happen soon.</i>

36:38.988 --> 36:40.156
Why aren't we stopping?

36:41.532 --> 36:44.285
Hey, Barry, what the hell is going on?

36:44.285 --> 36:46.454
Not sure. You're through the pass, buddy.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.624
Haven't seen a climax this lame
since <i>The Sixth Sense</i>.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.584
You knew Bruce Willis was dead?

36:52.084 --> 36:53.961
He spends the whole movie
hanging out with a kid.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.796
Who is he, Big Bird?

36:58.424 --> 36:59.675
It's a helicopter.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.597
I knew we were right.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.892
Hey, team,
he's attacking the train by chopper.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.810
Dad, where's the sandwich guy?

37:12.855 --> 37:15.107
Keep everyone down
and away from the windows.

37:24.825 --> 37:27.328
Stay calm!
Everything is going to be okay.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.252
Shit.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.631
Everyone stay down!

37:38.631 --> 37:39.674
Emma.

37:41.717 --> 37:43.928
The helicopter's attached
to the tanker car.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.888
They're trying to pump out
the radioactive waste.

37:45.888 --> 37:47.682
- And?
- And what?

37:47.682 --> 37:49.392
And I was right about the BLT guy.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.270
You have to listen to me
next time, please.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.437
<i>I ran the numbers.</i>

37:53.437 --> 37:56.482
We have about 12 minutes
before those guys suck the tank dry

37:56.482 --> 37:58.943
and Boro has what he needs
to make the bomb to end all bombs.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.486
<i>You gotta disconnect that hose.</i>

38:00.486 --> 38:02.029
- I'm on it.
- Where are you going?

38:02.029 --> 38:03.406
To shoot down the helo.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.866
<i>Negative.
The train is going through grain fields.</i>

38:05.866 --> 38:07.952
Kazakhstan is one of the world's
top producers.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.578
If you take down that helicopter,

38:09.578 --> 38:11.789
it's gonna aerosol nuclear waste
for miles.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.416
<i>It'll poison the land for generations.</i>

38:13.416 --> 38:15.543
<i>It'll start a famine
that will kill millions.</i>

38:15.543 --> 38:17.670
- Is that all?
- Clock's ticking. We need a plan.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.171
We gotta think this through.

38:19.171 --> 38:20.548
We can't be hasty.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.134
If we cannot disconnect the hose,

38:24.010 --> 38:25.511
then we make them want to do it.

38:25.511 --> 38:26.637
But how?

38:27.138 --> 38:28.180
We speed up the train.

38:28.180 --> 38:30.391
You're right.
What's the Chinook helicopter's top speed?

38:30.391 --> 38:31.976
Uh, 188 miles per hour.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.104
If the train goes faster than that,
they'll have to detach the helo.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.981
Otherwise,
they'll spin out of control and die.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.859
It's going at 150 miles per hour,
per passenger safety regulations,

38:39.859 --> 38:41.569
but it redlines at 270.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.905
We have a plan. You see?
Hotheads never have cool ideas.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.324
Let's go.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.000
- Speed up the train.
- I can't. It's too dangerous.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.669
More dangerous than letting a terrorist
get nuclear material?

38:58.669 --> 39:02.131
My responsibility
is for the safety of the passengers.

39:06.761 --> 39:10.264
You know what? Um, you're right.
That's a... That's a big ask.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.684
Can I have some of that gum?
That's my favorite kind.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.811
It's just, you know,
it's gotten so expensive.

39:25.488 --> 39:28.032
You shouldn't chew this stuff.
It's bad for your teeth.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.576
Big man, heard gunshots.
Give me a little somethin'.

39:30.576 --> 39:31.786
We are screwed.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.079
Not what I was looking for.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.580
Conductor went night-night.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.082
<i>Aldon, Roo, how do we speed up this thing?</i>

39:36.082 --> 39:37.708
Excuse me, sir, we need your help.

39:37.708 --> 39:41.128
No, not now. Something is wrong.
The train. I can't get hold of conductor.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.880
Because the conductor is a terrorist.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.841
We have two other American inspectors
on that train that just took him out.

39:45.841 --> 39:49.178
Your train is under attack.
The only way to save it is to speed it up.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.805
Look, Moby, if we were bad guys,

39:50.805 --> 39:53.099
we would've tried to kill you
as soon as we got in here.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.893
We are clearly trying to save this train,
not crash it.

39:55.893 --> 39:59.647
I... I can't speed train from here.
Only turn power off and on.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.108
- They need to use manual override.
- What does it look like?

40:02.108 --> 40:05.277
<i>It's a panel with a large red button
beside a key switch.</i>

40:05.277 --> 40:06.987
<i>-</i> <i>You got that?</i>
- Kind of.

40:06.987 --> 40:10.032
<i>-</i> <i>What's wrong?</i>
- The override has been overridden.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.952
Guys, Tina says there still might be a way
to crank up the speed.

40:12.952 --> 40:13.869
Well, how?

40:13.869 --> 40:16.789
Physics. Says right here
maglevs run on super cold magnets.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.541
The colder the magnet,
the higher the speed.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.458
Nerd's not wrong.

40:19.458 --> 40:22.670
You can pump more coolant into the system,
but the ratio would have to be dead-on.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.255
Pulling up schematics now.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.051
It's Mom. She says it's urgent. It's fine.

40:29.051 --> 40:31.971
Guys, there should be a floor panel
right near you, by the door.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.180
Okay, I'll take care of this.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.349
You call Mom. Urgent is urgent.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.062
Hey, Mom, is everything okay?

40:40.062 --> 40:42.606
Carter called. He's very upset.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.067
That's why you're calling me
on a business trip?

40:45.067 --> 40:48.696
About a stupid clock and a stupid show?

40:48.696 --> 40:51.073
He was looking forward
to doing something with you,

40:51.073 --> 40:53.492
and you ditched him for work again.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.745
Honey, you don't wanna end up
like your dad and me.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.040
I'll smooth it over when I get home, okay?

41:00.040 --> 41:02.126
Good. Good, I hope so.

41:02.710 --> 41:03.961
How's the job going?

41:04.587 --> 41:06.380
Uh, you know, just dodging bullets

41:06.380 --> 41:08.632
and trying to keep the whole thing
from blowing up in my face.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.260
Yeah, I love you too, Mom.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.345
Okay. Say hi to Donnie. Bye.

41:13.345 --> 41:16.682
Hey, Barry, I need an update
on Operation Don Juan.

41:16.682 --> 41:17.850
<i>Urgent.</i>

41:20.186 --> 41:21.395
Ew.

41:21.395 --> 41:22.688
Ready to flood the system?

41:22.688 --> 41:23.689
Affirmative.

41:23.689 --> 41:26.025
<i>Careful!
Too much coolant means too much speed.</i>

41:26.025 --> 41:29.153
Too much speed, you can't stop the train
before it crashes into the depot.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.197
Not enough,
Boro gets what he needs to make a bomb.

41:31.197 --> 41:35.159
Gotta Mama Bear this thing.
Not too hot, not too cold, just right.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.036
We have our comms in.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.871
Why did we need these
as part of our disguise?

41:38.871 --> 41:40.080
What are you talking about?

41:40.080 --> 41:41.624
What are we, train inspectors

41:41.624 --> 41:44.043
that are making hands-free phone calls
to our moms?

41:44.043 --> 41:46.504
What? These are so cool.
Tony Robbins wears these.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.380
How many coolant valves do I need to open?

41:48.380 --> 41:50.508
My girl's calculating that now.

41:51.258 --> 41:52.343
Four?!

41:55.596 --> 41:57.515
- All right, I opened all four.
<i>-</i> <i>What?</i>

41:57.515 --> 41:59.475
- Why did you open four?
- Because you said four.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.435
I didn't say anything. Barry said four.

42:01.435 --> 42:03.187
I was talking about Donatello!

42:03.187 --> 42:04.897
He just took four Viagras!

42:04.897 --> 42:07.441
I knew you were spying on him.
You're such a liar.

42:07.441 --> 42:10.236
Four? Sounds like Donnie Boy's
going on a Tally rally.

42:10.236 --> 42:11.987
I told Dot this would happen.

42:11.987 --> 42:13.405
You always have to control things,

42:13.405 --> 42:16.200
and now you put the mission at risk
so you could stalk Mom's boyfriend.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.160
It worked.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.663
The chopper disconnected.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.331
It couldn't keep up.

42:22.831 --> 42:25.292
No way they got enough material
to make a bomb.

42:27.503 --> 42:29.797
Uh-oh. Speedometer's blowing up
like Donnie's chinos.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.257
You overcooled the magnets.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.300
The train is going too fast to stop.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.386
When it reaches the depot in Nur-Sultan,

42:35.386 --> 42:37.846
everyone on board
and half the town will be killed.

42:37.846 --> 42:41.433
Congratulations, Dad.
You made the world's largest dirty bomb.
