WEBVTT

00:46.755 --> 00:51.802
I, Wakizaka, have defeated
Joseon's southern army,

00:51.885 --> 00:56.723
achieving victory though far outnumbered.

00:56.807 --> 01:01.979
I have aided our northern advance,
securing Joseon's capital Hanyang.

01:02.813 --> 01:07.943
Only Joseon's navy continues to resurface

01:08.026 --> 01:11.989
on the southern coast.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.284
I now set out to destroy them.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.120
Lord Chancellor,

01:18.203 --> 01:21.915
we will be ready for your arrival
as planned.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.461
Bunroku year one, Wakizaka of Awaji.

01:33.552 --> 01:38.390
WAE ENEMY (FOREIGN ISLANDS) BASE,
BUSANPO, GYEONGSANG-DO, JUNE 1592

02:10.964 --> 02:12.883
Thank you.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.286
WAKIZAKA YASUHARU

02:41.370 --> 02:42.996
Bokkaisen (sea monster)?

02:45.582 --> 02:46.500
Dono. (lord)

02:46.834 --> 02:49.586
Our foe Yi Sun-shin built a new ship.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.547
It looked menacing,

02:52.214 --> 02:54.174
just like a Bokkaisen,

02:55.133 --> 02:56.593
the mythical sea monster.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.389
Our guns were useless.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.809
It had a dragon head spouting fire.

03:04.476 --> 03:08.856
We were struck by sheer terror.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.283
Bokkaisen, you say.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.254
Fear is a contagion.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.777
Was the ship rammed?

03:56.153 --> 03:59.114
Wrecked off the Sacheon coast.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.490
We hauled it here.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.180
A MONTH AGO, SACHEON
GYEONGSANG-DO, SOUTHEAST JOSEON

05:10.394 --> 05:12.354
CHIEF LEE EON-RYANG
Row backward!

05:12.437 --> 05:14.439
We must break loose!

05:15.023 --> 05:16.942
Row backward!

05:26.994 --> 05:29.204
CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

05:38.422 --> 05:41.008
Prepare to fire the dragon head
and all front cannons at once!

05:41.091 --> 05:42.467
Load them now!

05:45.804 --> 05:47.055
Fire!

05:57.482 --> 05:58.775
It's the Bokkaisen!

06:03.238 --> 06:04.323
Fire!

07:47.718 --> 07:50.137
BUSAN FORTRESS

07:50.220 --> 07:51.722
ON APRIL 13, 1592,

07:51.805 --> 07:54.349
BUSAN FORTRESS WAS ATTACKED
BY WAE INVADERS.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.602
HANYANG

07:56.685 --> 07:58.854
WAE FORCES OVERTOOK BUSAN FORTRESS,

07:58.937 --> 08:01.773
OCCUPYING JOSEON'S CAPITAL HANYANG
IN 20 DAYS.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.484
PYEONGYANG

08:04.568 --> 08:09.740
KING SEONJO FLED NORTH TO PYEONGYANG
AS THE WAE INVADERS SWEPT NORTHWARD.

08:10.866 --> 08:11.867
GWANGGYOSAN

08:11.950 --> 08:15.162
50,000 SOLDIERS FROM THE PROVINCES JEOLLA,
GYEONGSANG, AND CHUNGCHEONG

08:15.245 --> 08:18.749
GATHERED AT GWANGGYOSAN MOUNTAIN
TO RECAPTURE THE CAPITAL HANYANG.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.792
GWANGGYOSAN MOUNTAIN, YONGIN

08:21.710 --> 08:23.754
BUT ON JUNE 5, 1592,

08:23.837 --> 08:29.843
WAKIZAKA AMBUSHED WITH 2,000 MEN,
DESTROYING JOSEON'S ARMY.

08:34.723 --> 08:39.770
JOSEON APPEARED TO BE
ON THE BRINK OF RUIN.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.192
MEANWHILE, ON THE SOUTHERN COAST
OF GOSEONG, GYEONGSANG-DO,

08:45.275 --> 08:47.236
20 WAE SHIPS WERE DESTROYED AT DANGHANGPO

08:47.319 --> 08:50.197
AS THE LEFT JEOLLA NAVY ADMIRAL
YI SUN-SHIN BATTLED ALONE AT SEA.

08:51.657 --> 08:55.953
IN HIS FIRST NAVAL CAMPAIGN
ACROSS OKPO, HAPPO, AND JEOKJINPO,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.121
HE DESTROYED 42 WAE SHIPS.

08:59.039 --> 09:05.045
BATTLING IN HIS SECOND CAMPAIGN
ACROSS SACHEON, DANGPO, DANGHANPO,

09:05.629 --> 09:08.048
HE SUFFERED AN EARLY GUNSHOT WOUND.

09:09.716 --> 09:15.722
HANSAN: RISING DRAGON

09:30.487 --> 09:34.199
FIVE DAYS TILL THE THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

09:40.247 --> 09:41.957
The turtle ship...

09:54.469 --> 09:56.805
Admiral. Sergeant Song reporting.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.391
Admiral Won has arrived.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.311
SERGEANT SONG HUI-RIP
I'll get ready. Send in the servant.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.478
Yes, sir.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.609
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY HEADQUARTERS, YEOSU

10:10.861 --> 10:12.821
What? A preemptive strike?

10:12.905 --> 10:15.240
RIGHT GYEONGSANG NAVY, ADMIRAL WON GYUN
Have you gone mad?

10:15.324 --> 10:18.660
COMMANDER JUNG UN
We must hasten to recapture Busan.

10:18.744 --> 10:22.331
Now is our time to catch
the Wae invaders off guard.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.374
We must strike first.

10:24.958 --> 10:29.671
Minor victories are useless
unless we attack their main base.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.007
Well, well...

10:32.090 --> 10:36.637
You're still drunk
on those minor victories.

10:36.720 --> 10:41.058
The enemy general in Busan led
the Battle of Gwanggyosan in Yongin.

10:41.517 --> 10:44.603
Do you not recall
Chief Commander Lee Gwang,

10:44.686 --> 10:47.981
who attacked the enemy
at Gwanggyosan Mountain?

10:48.065 --> 10:50.192
His men were annihilated!

10:50.275 --> 10:53.862
He is blamed for the defeat,
deemed a traitor.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.990
There is a tide of war.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.410
We must defend, not attack!

11:03.830 --> 11:06.625
Tell me. Do you agree with him?

11:06.708 --> 11:10.671
Or have your underlings gone mad?

11:10.754 --> 11:12.589
- Watch your words!
- Underlings?

11:13.257 --> 11:14.883
Admiral Won,

11:14.967 --> 11:17.135
RIGHT JEOLLA NAVY, ADMIRAL LEE EOK-GI
do you have a better idea?

11:17.219 --> 11:20.806
Defense! Ironclad defense!

11:21.014 --> 11:22.474
With an ironclad barrier on the sea,

11:22.558 --> 11:25.519
we'll defend
the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

11:25.602 --> 11:28.355
I'll burn down the provisional
Right Gyeongsang Navy Headquarters,

11:28.438 --> 11:29.940
joining you here instead.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.653
With our joint fleet
fending off the enemy,

11:35.529 --> 11:38.907
won't our headquarters here be
a steely fortress?

11:51.837 --> 11:54.131
RIGHT GYEONGSANG NAVY
COMMANDER LEE UN-RYONG

11:54.423 --> 11:58.093
An elder such as yourself
need not see me out.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.554
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY, COMMANDER EO YOUNG-DAM
Since you're a former cadet

12:00.637 --> 12:02.806
now busy as a commander,

12:03.265 --> 12:05.976
this is an old teacher's chance

12:06.059 --> 12:09.062
to enjoy rare company.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.857
You're in good spirits as always.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.734
And in good health, it seems.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.611
By no means.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.740
I'm suffering under a dreadful superior.

12:20.324 --> 12:24.870
But you're no stranger
to dreadful superiors.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.331
Alas, we suffer alike.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.003
Good night, sir.

12:45.766 --> 12:49.603
WAE (FOREIGN ISLANDS) ENEMY BASE,
BUSANPO, GYEONSANG-DO

12:52.940 --> 12:54.900
The lord chancellor has

12:54.983 --> 12:56.610
high hopes for you.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.195
You are welcome here,

12:58.695 --> 12:59.696
advisor.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.658
I saw your men looking busy.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.202
Isn't it too soon for haste?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.916
KURODA KANBEI
LORD CHANCELLOR'S ADVISOR

13:12.835 --> 13:14.002
Here.

13:14.086 --> 13:17.923
The lord chancellor sends his reply.

13:32.312 --> 13:37.109
In the Battle of Yongin
at Gwanggyosan Mountain,

13:37.609 --> 13:41.154
do you know how I destroyed 50,000 men
with only 2,000?

13:41.572 --> 13:42.739
Why,

13:43.615 --> 13:49.621
you caught them unawares
with a preemptive ambush.

13:51.415 --> 13:54.126
YEOSU
Yi Sun-shin's headquarters here

13:54.418 --> 13:56.170
must be struck down immediately.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.130
And then...

13:59.339 --> 14:00.465
Then?

14:02.926 --> 14:07.472
We must reinforce Konishi's division
up north in Pyeongyang.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.141
Once we do,

14:09.391 --> 14:13.312
our conquest of Joseon shall be complete.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.314
Impressive.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.066
Worthy of the lord chancellor's
preeminent warrior.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.360
Konishi up north in Pyeongyang

14:20.652 --> 14:22.863
will be beholden to you,
bowing in gratitude.

14:23.614 --> 14:27.659
I thought you might hasten
like the other generals

14:28.327 --> 14:31.288
straight to Ming China.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.999
I was concerned.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.420
No doubt, you also crave

14:39.338 --> 14:41.840
the conquest of Ming China.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.091
However,

14:44.134 --> 14:47.179
I advise against a solo campaign.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.849
As things now stand,
there is no need for risk.

14:53.519 --> 14:56.522
Better to lead a joint campaign
at full force.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.774
I understand.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.567
Hence,

15:01.235 --> 15:02.861
I have a request.

15:04.488 --> 15:05.864
About Kato, I presume?

15:09.201 --> 15:11.662
TURTLE SHIP DOCKYARD
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY HEADQUARTERS

15:12.162 --> 15:14.039
You're removing the dragon head?

15:14.665 --> 15:17.960
Since the Battle of Sacheon,
I've been thinking.

15:18.043 --> 15:21.755
I stayed up nights
unable to shake the belief

15:21.839 --> 15:23.173
that you need the turtle ship.

15:23.257 --> 15:27.135
Will it no longer get lodged upon ramming?

15:29.346 --> 15:31.849
It's the only way to solve that problem.

15:33.225 --> 15:37.646
Will it also improve its speed?

15:38.021 --> 15:39.189
Indeed, sir.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.819
A headless turtle ship...

15:53.245 --> 15:55.163
Have you heard?

15:55.247 --> 15:58.250
The latest Wae invaders to arrive
in Busan...

16:01.879 --> 16:03.463
I hear they're quite formidable.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.926
How is Admiral Yi's order coming along?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.595
Well...

16:09.678 --> 16:11.388
GUNNERY MASTER
LEE BONG-SU

16:11.471 --> 16:13.056
...we're gathering

16:13.140 --> 16:15.684
all the gunpower ingredients we can,
sourcing it from the people.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.812
But the turtle ships guzzle so much.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.772
Gunpowder-guzzling monsters, they are.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.694
The turtle ships can join
the admiral's fleet

16:25.777 --> 16:27.321
only if you make haste.

16:28.363 --> 16:31.575
The ramming ships must do more than ram.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.160
Right.

16:35.621 --> 16:36.747
By the way,

16:39.583 --> 16:40.959
this is for you.

16:43.837 --> 16:44.671
What's this?

16:44.755 --> 16:47.925
I caught the critter myself.

16:48.467 --> 16:52.095
If you ever get lonely or discouraged,
it can cheer you up.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.182
- Mocking me, are you?
- Take it easy.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.145
Cook a turtle soup for your health
if you'd like.

17:00.938 --> 17:04.566
Before you become a shell of a man.

17:04.650 --> 17:07.152
That impudence.

17:13.534 --> 17:16.870
Defense! Ironclad defense!

17:16.954 --> 17:19.873
We must defend, not attack!

17:21.458 --> 17:26.630
I have a letter from Jeonju Fortress
sent by Chief Commander Lee Gwang.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.595
He was pained

17:33.679 --> 17:37.975
to recall his defeat
at Gwanggyosan Mountain.

17:38.684 --> 17:40.686
The enemy Wakizaka

17:40.769 --> 17:44.398
did not stay behind
to guard Suwon Fortress.

17:44.481 --> 17:49.027
Instead, he advanced
to Yongin's Gwanggyosan Mountain,

17:49.111 --> 17:52.030
tiring and luring our troops.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.826
When our men lowered their guard,

17:55.909 --> 17:59.246
setting up camp in an open field,

17:59.788 --> 18:04.543
Wakizaka ambushed at dawn,
annihilating our army.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.299
His stronghold was defended

18:10.382 --> 18:13.635
without a defensive strategy.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.141
Admiral Yi.

18:23.395 --> 18:24.855
His Majesty sends word.

18:37.492 --> 18:38.827
What has happened?

18:40.621 --> 18:43.040
We received word from Pyeongyang.

18:45.751 --> 18:47.920
HIS MAJESTY HAS DEPARTED TO UIJU
BY THE NORTHWEST BORDER.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.383
How could he forsake Pyeongyang Fortress?

18:53.467 --> 18:55.886
There is more at stake than Pyeongyang.

18:56.220 --> 18:59.765
We must ask why His Majesty left for Uiju

18:59.848 --> 19:01.517
by the northwest border.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.812
The Chief Commander preferred
the northeast province Hamgyeong-do

19:05.896 --> 19:08.398
as a defensible base,

19:08.482 --> 19:12.027
but His Majesty chose Uiju
by the northwest border instead.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.155
Will His Majesty

19:15.572 --> 19:17.824
seek refuge westward in Ming China?

19:19.701 --> 19:20.994
That cannot be.

19:21.578 --> 19:25.123
It will destroy the people's morale

19:26.208 --> 19:28.293
and threaten the fate of our land.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.926
Based on our training
with Joseon prisoners,

19:36.385 --> 19:40.097
Joseon's navy cannons reach a firing range
of 1,000 yards.

19:40.848 --> 19:43.141
They are destructive within 500 yards.

19:43.684 --> 19:47.688
WATANABE SHICHIEMON
They aim accurately within 100 yards.

19:48.897 --> 19:51.316
One hundred yards.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.486
Their panokseon (Joseon warships)

19:55.028 --> 19:57.155
have a strange way of reloading cannons.

19:57.406 --> 19:58.532
How so?

19:58.991 --> 20:01.785
Instead of reloading,
they rotate their ships,

20:02.327 --> 20:04.997
firing from the other side.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.750
Interesting.

20:10.544 --> 20:11.712
However,

20:11.962 --> 20:14.715
even if their panokseon ships refire
faster that way,

20:14.798 --> 20:17.718
we can press with speed
from 200 yards away,

20:17.801 --> 20:19.511
overtaking their ships.

20:20.554 --> 20:22.139
From 200 yards,

20:22.806 --> 20:24.057
overtaking them.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.605
Dono.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.857
We must ambush again.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.483
MANABE SAMANOSUKE
Deploy the fleet at once.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.988
If they block us,

20:39.865 --> 20:44.328
we will crush that troublesome thing.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.921
You mean the sea monster Bokkaisen,

20:54.880 --> 20:58.634
or rather their mekurabune (blind ship)?

20:59.009 --> 21:00.469
Mekurabune.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.888
Blind ship.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.476
I like that name better than Bokkaisen.

21:08.101 --> 21:11.355
The mekurabune fought only one battle.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.981
But why?

21:14.191 --> 21:16.068
Why won't they battle with a ship

21:16.151 --> 21:18.612
rumored to be a monstrous Bokkaisen?

21:22.533 --> 21:23.575
Sahei.

21:24.785 --> 21:26.036
You have two days.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.872
Go scout the Left Jeolla Navy.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.334
Find out about the mekurabune.

21:33.001 --> 21:34.169
Also,

21:35.838 --> 21:38.048
about Yi Sun-shin.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.224
Watanabe.

21:48.517 --> 21:51.436
About Kobayakawa
leading the sixth division

21:51.520 --> 21:53.605
in Geumsan near Jeolla-do.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.319
I must send word to him.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.365
Admiral.

22:03.866 --> 22:05.158
Admiral Yi.

22:07.953 --> 22:10.664
Our headquarters here might be
His Majesty's last refuge.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.666
Instead of rushing to battle,

22:12.749 --> 22:15.878
perhaps we should guard this place
as Admiral Won suggested.

22:19.715 --> 22:21.508
Will you still attack

22:21.925 --> 22:24.386
the Wae invaders' base at Busan Fortress?

22:32.060 --> 22:35.189
Does it look so in your eyes?

22:39.651 --> 22:40.903
Is it not so?

22:42.196 --> 22:43.655
Perhaps it is.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.576
But as Admiral Won has said,

22:48.327 --> 22:50.579
we're on the defensive.

22:51.830 --> 22:55.209
An attack on Busan requires caution.

22:55.876 --> 22:58.128
If you will neither defend nor attack,

22:58.504 --> 23:00.881
what is your battle plan?

23:05.427 --> 23:06.595
Perhaps

23:08.055 --> 23:09.890
our next battle will determine

23:11.767 --> 23:15.187
the fate of this war.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.666
HEUNGGUKSA TEMPLE REFUGE
Rice balls!

23:35.749 --> 23:36.834
Rice!

23:38.001 --> 23:40.087
Please have some food.

23:53.392 --> 23:56.019
I saw that man at Busan Fortress.

24:05.904 --> 24:07.364
Interesting.

24:08.198 --> 24:09.867
- Be careful.
- All right.

24:34.975 --> 24:37.019
I have received your letter.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.396
I appreciate the offer,

24:39.479 --> 24:44.776
but as commander of the sixth division,

24:44.860 --> 24:48.739
I, Kobayakawa, will attack Jeonju Fortress
as planned.

24:48.822 --> 24:52.910
Now that Geumsan Fortress is cleared
of the Joseon people's militia,

24:53.243 --> 24:56.747
I can soon advance on Jeonju Fortress
in Jeolla-do.

25:06.381 --> 25:07.758
Transcribe my reply.

25:09.760 --> 25:14.306
Instead of attacking Jeonju Fortress
with the sixth division,

25:14.932 --> 25:17.851
I ask you to strike Yi Sun-shin's
Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

25:17.935 --> 25:21.980
Do so, and I will grant you
all my conquests in Jeolla-do.

25:22.064 --> 25:26.401
The war's outcome depends on
the Left Jeolla Navy, not Jeonju Fortress.

25:26.485 --> 25:29.696
Now, join me in this attack,

25:29.780 --> 25:32.157
which will please the lord chancellor.

25:39.498 --> 25:40.499
Dono.

25:40.582 --> 25:44.086
Will you grant Kobayakawa
all of Jeolla-do?

25:44.169 --> 25:47.005
Yi is a mere hindrance we can defeat
without his help.

25:47.089 --> 25:48.382
A mere hindrance?

25:51.718 --> 25:54.346
How will you defeat Yi?

25:54.680 --> 25:58.141
By catching him off guard
with a preemptive strike!

25:58.225 --> 25:59.810
As we did at Gwanggyosan!

25:59.893 --> 26:01.728
Let's stay one step ahead.

26:01.812 --> 26:03.438
We'll defeat him also on land.

26:03.522 --> 26:06.859
It's a plan for total victory,
which I have while Yi doesn't.

26:06.942 --> 26:10.153
- But we're ready--
- Joseon will fall soon.

26:10.779 --> 26:12.948
The war will shift to Ming China.

26:13.031 --> 26:15.158
By reaching Ming first,

26:15.701 --> 26:17.786
we will conquer much more.

26:18.537 --> 26:20.664
Jeolla-do pales in comparison.

26:21.206 --> 26:23.083
Do you not understand?

26:23.458 --> 26:24.459
But

26:24.793 --> 26:28.672
will Kato's fleet arrive in time?

26:28.755 --> 26:32.426
Kanbei is a man of his word.

26:32.509 --> 26:33.927
He will make it happen.

26:37.472 --> 26:41.476
Why did your men at Sacheon join
the division at Geumsan near Jeolla?

26:41.852 --> 26:45.397
Will they deploy from Geumsan
to attack Jeonju Fortress?

26:45.898 --> 26:47.399
When will they strike?

26:47.649 --> 26:49.067
I know nothing.

26:49.151 --> 26:50.360
Nothing at all.

26:50.694 --> 26:52.029
Nothing.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.662
You fools!

27:01.455 --> 27:03.457
Jeonju Fortress matters little.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.668
Our Wae army is gathering

27:06.752 --> 27:08.712
in great numbers in Busan.

27:08.962 --> 27:12.549
Joseon will be annihilated

27:12.633 --> 27:15.260
on our way to Ming China and India.

27:15.344 --> 27:19.056
You should beg for your lives!

27:42.371 --> 27:43.705
Who are you?

27:49.378 --> 27:50.754
- Admiral!
- Admiral!

27:50.838 --> 27:52.005
Why, you!

27:52.506 --> 27:53.590
How dare you!

27:59.513 --> 28:00.848
Dono!

28:00.931 --> 28:03.225
What have they done to him?

28:03.308 --> 28:05.102
Are you alright?

28:05.727 --> 28:06.728
Dono!

28:15.028 --> 28:18.949
You're the reason we endure.

28:19.700 --> 28:23.787
You're a hero to us all!

28:31.253 --> 28:32.963
Do not take his life.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.966
I sense he has a veiled purpose.

29:07.998 --> 29:09.374
This war...

29:11.376 --> 29:12.878
What is it about?

29:14.463 --> 29:17.174
I beseech you to tell me.

29:17.424 --> 29:20.052
What is this war?

29:24.515 --> 29:26.725
A battle of the righteous
against the unrighteous.

29:29.603 --> 29:33.106
Not a battle of nations?

29:35.609 --> 29:36.610
No.

29:53.710 --> 29:56.922
I shot you at Sacheon.

29:58.423 --> 30:01.635
I saw with my own eyes

30:03.470 --> 30:06.849
how you stepped forth
to save your soldier.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.438
But my commander

30:14.606 --> 30:16.400
used us men as shields

30:17.317 --> 30:19.570
to save himself.

30:24.700 --> 30:28.662
Please. Let me serve you.

30:46.180 --> 30:48.682
NOKDUNDO ISLAND,
HAMGYEONG-DO (NORTHEAST BORDER)

32:20.774 --> 32:22.818
Why did I dream of this?

32:53.473 --> 32:57.352
His stronghold was defended

32:58.061 --> 33:01.231
without a defensive strategy.

33:06.945 --> 33:09.031
Defended

33:09.114 --> 33:12.492
without a defensive strategy.

33:30.969 --> 33:34.932
THREE DAYS TILL THE THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

33:44.024 --> 33:48.445
Is this formation defensive? Or offensive?

33:49.571 --> 33:53.450
Surely defensive.
Like a barrier on the sea.

33:54.618 --> 33:56.370
A barrier on the sea?

33:57.621 --> 33:58.872
Over there,

33:58.956 --> 34:01.875
we're simulating the Wae invaders' attack.

34:13.595 --> 34:15.973
It's quite realistic.

34:23.772 --> 34:25.232
Crane wing formation.

34:25.482 --> 34:26.567
Yes, Admiral.

34:30.237 --> 34:32.114
Crane wing formation!

34:32.197 --> 34:33.907
Crane wing formation!

34:41.874 --> 34:44.376
We must move to the left wing.

34:44.459 --> 34:45.460
Yes, sir.

34:46.628 --> 34:48.463
To the right wing's center.

34:48.547 --> 34:49.715
On the double.

34:49.798 --> 34:50.883
Yes, sir.

35:12.446 --> 35:14.156
We're colliding!

35:15.699 --> 35:17.075
Watch your position!

35:18.827 --> 35:20.913
Go farther left!

35:20.996 --> 35:23.582
We're due at the left wing's center!

35:27.127 --> 35:29.838
The right wing looks unsteady.

35:30.881 --> 35:33.967
Never mind. We'll go head-on.

35:44.019 --> 35:46.230
- Raise the ladders.
- Raise them!

35:50.317 --> 35:51.485
Rotate the ship.

35:51.985 --> 35:52.986
Rotate!

35:53.737 --> 35:55.239
Port oars, stop!

35:57.366 --> 35:59.493
Rotate!

35:59.701 --> 36:02.829
Starboard oars, row faster!

36:11.380 --> 36:12.881
Back to formation!

36:12.965 --> 36:14.967
Back to formation!

36:32.693 --> 36:34.403
- Rotate.
- Rotate!

36:34.486 --> 36:35.863
Rotate!

36:35.946 --> 36:38.782
Port oars, stop! Rotate!

37:00.971 --> 37:04.725
Sir, we can't rotate
within such short distance.

37:05.142 --> 37:09.146
Not with Admiral Won's ships
that lack training.

37:11.190 --> 37:14.026
Keep him in the formation.

37:15.527 --> 37:17.696
And deliver this to Admiral Lee Eok-gi.

37:19.156 --> 37:20.324
Yes, sir.

37:24.661 --> 37:26.079
Rotate the ship!

37:40.344 --> 37:41.512
Reporting, sir.

37:41.970 --> 37:43.680
Since the Battle of Sacheon,

37:43.764 --> 37:45.599
the mekurabune was never seen in training.

37:50.312 --> 37:53.065
There must be a problem
with the mekurabune.

37:53.565 --> 37:55.817
We must find out what it is.

37:58.278 --> 38:00.572
We'll enter their headquarters.

38:01.031 --> 38:02.074
Let's move.

38:09.873 --> 38:12.167
- Fire!
- What do you want?

38:18.507 --> 38:21.051
- Who are you?
- We're on your side.

38:30.853 --> 38:32.688
The prisoners' cells are on fire!

38:32.771 --> 38:35.649
The prisoners are escaping! After them!

39:19.484 --> 39:21.653
No wonder you looked murderous for a monk.

39:21.737 --> 39:23.864
Catch them! Catch the prisoners!

39:30.204 --> 39:32.414
The turtle ship is in flames!

39:32.497 --> 39:34.750
Put out the fire! Now!

39:56.605 --> 39:57.606
Follow me.

40:13.497 --> 40:15.123
You call yourselves officers in charge?

40:15.374 --> 40:17.584
It's your duty to guard the turtle ship!

40:17.668 --> 40:20.504
At all times with no exception!

40:20.587 --> 40:22.047
This is a failure in duty!

40:30.389 --> 40:34.518
Admiral. I'm afraid the head spy escaped.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.103
We've failed you, sir.

40:36.186 --> 40:38.272
Move! Hurry up!

40:39.106 --> 40:40.732
Hurry up!

40:40.816 --> 40:41.859
Admiral.

40:42.067 --> 40:45.112
A few prisoners are missing.

40:46.947 --> 40:48.156
Hurry up!

40:51.743 --> 40:53.912
- Admiral.
- Any damages to the turtle ship?

40:53.996 --> 40:56.415
CHIEF LEE GI-NAM
Some scorches. Nothing serious.

40:56.498 --> 41:01.295
The head spy stole
the turtle ship's construction plans.

41:05.966 --> 41:07.509
Where is Chief Nah?

41:07.801 --> 41:11.096
At the Suncheon dockyard
since two days ago.

41:11.305 --> 41:13.056
Let us go there.

41:28.155 --> 41:30.532
SECRET DOCKYARD, SUNCHEON, NEAR YEOSU

41:33.285 --> 41:35.370
This turtle ship has to be better!

41:35.996 --> 41:37.956
Seal that joint!

41:42.085 --> 41:44.254
Admiral! Admiral.

41:45.464 --> 41:48.258
I heard about the spies.

41:49.176 --> 41:52.471
I'm relieved
that the turtle ships weren't damaged.

41:52.554 --> 41:55.682
I am told
you're reattaching the dragon head.

41:58.143 --> 41:59.228
Yes, sir.

42:02.147 --> 42:03.941
We must wage battle soon.

42:05.442 --> 42:09.947
Will this turtle ship be ready?

42:10.614 --> 42:12.533
We're working night and day.

42:12.783 --> 42:15.327
We need a few more days.

42:19.498 --> 42:21.333
The spies escaped

42:21.917 --> 42:23.961
with your construction plans.

42:24.586 --> 42:28.298
Wakizaka will learn
about the turtle ship's weaknesses.

42:29.508 --> 42:30.592
Admiral.

42:31.468 --> 42:33.637
This new turtle ship is different.

42:38.475 --> 42:42.604
I will fight this battle
without turtle ships.

42:46.942 --> 42:48.151
I must leave now.

42:51.530 --> 42:52.531
Admiral.

42:57.327 --> 43:00.247
The sides look weak.

43:01.039 --> 43:05.711
Good for firing cannons
but exposed to attack.

43:06.003 --> 43:07.421
Also,

43:08.839 --> 43:11.717
the head and cover must be heavy.

43:13.010 --> 43:15.053
I wonder if it can sail with any speed.

43:18.682 --> 43:20.434
Junsa, was it?

43:22.686 --> 43:25.147
So you fought against the ship.

43:25.397 --> 43:28.859
Yes, at the Battle of Sacheon.

43:29.067 --> 43:32.487
Indeed, its movement seemed quite slow.

43:32.821 --> 43:34.114
Go on.

43:34.781 --> 43:35.824
At Sacheon,

43:35.908 --> 43:38.327
we fell for Yi's luring tactic.

43:38.577 --> 43:39.995
Luring tactic?

43:40.329 --> 43:41.580
Yes, sir.

43:42.623 --> 43:43.790
However,

43:43.874 --> 43:45.959
as you pointed out,

43:46.043 --> 43:49.379
we could've easily destroyed the ship

43:49.588 --> 43:53.342
had we been prepared.

43:53.675 --> 43:57.763
Once it rammed into our warship,

43:58.138 --> 43:59.890
the dragon head was lodged,
unable to move.

43:59.973 --> 44:02.142
The dragon head was lodged?

44:02.226 --> 44:03.227
Yes, sir.

44:07.356 --> 44:09.900
So, that was the flaw.

44:12.736 --> 44:15.239
A flawed ram.

44:18.659 --> 44:19.743
And yet,

44:20.077 --> 44:24.289
it was called the Bokkaisen,
striking terror in our men.

44:26.333 --> 44:30.671
Are you implying it was a false rumor?

44:34.883 --> 44:35.926
Watanabe.

44:36.468 --> 44:38.011
What do you think?

44:38.595 --> 44:40.514
Since it was absent from training,

44:40.848 --> 44:43.559
it probably won't be deployed.

44:43.892 --> 44:45.894
However, I'm concerned

44:45.978 --> 44:49.815
by Sahei's report
regarding their crane wing formation.

44:51.859 --> 44:54.862
It appears to be an offensive.

44:55.070 --> 44:57.906
I suspect they will surround Busanpo
to mount an attack.

44:57.990 --> 44:59.449
No, sir.

44:59.992 --> 45:01.827
Yi was using prisoners

45:01.910 --> 45:04.997
to prepare defensive tactics.

45:05.080 --> 45:08.083
Besides, without the mekurabune,

45:08.166 --> 45:09.626
he cannot risk an attack.

45:09.710 --> 45:12.629
Dono. These are baseless claims.

45:12.713 --> 45:13.797
Enough.

45:15.132 --> 45:16.133
Junsa.

45:18.719 --> 45:19.928
Come closer.

45:30.564 --> 45:31.773
Closer.

45:43.118 --> 45:45.871
Justify your claim.

45:53.462 --> 45:54.880
Even their king has fled

45:55.756 --> 45:57.966
to the northwest border.

45:58.675 --> 46:01.845
Hence, Yi will be looking to retreat.

46:02.221 --> 46:04.806
He wouldn't dare advance in attack.

46:14.608 --> 46:16.735
I must say,

46:17.611 --> 46:19.780
it's decent reasoning.

46:32.584 --> 46:35.337
Dono. Kato's fleet has arrived.

46:54.439 --> 46:57.901
Arriving at the perfect time.

47:06.577 --> 47:09.955
KATO YOSHIAKI

47:13.292 --> 47:15.836
KUKI YOSHITAKA

47:20.090 --> 47:22.009
The war god Hachiman

47:23.552 --> 47:25.554
shines on me again.

47:46.700 --> 47:48.118
Admiral!

47:50.621 --> 47:53.123
Can you win your battle
without the turtle ship?

47:55.083 --> 47:59.505
Can you truly win without the turtle ship?

48:16.897 --> 48:20.901
Your wound has yet to heal.
Yet you're shooting arrows already.

48:29.993 --> 48:30.994
Admiral.

48:31.620 --> 48:34.414
I'm convinced by our training

48:34.498 --> 48:37.417
that we need the turtle ships.

48:39.294 --> 48:40.546
Do you not agree?

48:44.424 --> 48:45.467
Admiral.

48:50.931 --> 48:51.932
Sir,

48:52.307 --> 48:55.894
Lim Jun-young brought his report
in person.

48:58.105 --> 48:59.231
In person?

49:01.108 --> 49:04.027
Until now, Wakizaka's fleet

49:04.111 --> 49:07.030
had 30 large ships, 70 medium ships,

49:07.114 --> 49:09.283
One hundred ships total.

49:09.366 --> 49:12.244
Kato Yoshiaki's fleet
from the southern island Daemado

49:12.327 --> 49:15.247
has now joined him
with 20 large ships and 20 small ships.

49:15.330 --> 49:17.666
That makes 140 ships total.

49:17.749 --> 49:21.128
Wakizaka's wait is over.
He will deploy soon.

49:21.211 --> 49:22.504
The time has arrived.

49:22.588 --> 49:23.672
But sir,

49:23.755 --> 49:26.800
Kato's ships are unique.

49:27.342 --> 49:28.385
Unique?

49:29.094 --> 49:32.014
Several large ships have thicker hulls

49:32.097 --> 49:35.601
and suspended cannons
we haven't seen before.

49:35.976 --> 49:38.103
As for their flagship,

49:38.187 --> 49:42.441
it's armed with cannons
and covered in iron plates.

49:42.649 --> 49:46.153
A flagship covered in iron plates?

49:46.904 --> 49:48.655
It is as expected.

49:48.739 --> 49:53.744
They prepared
against our cannons and rams.

49:54.203 --> 49:55.204
This enemy fleet...

49:55.287 --> 49:58.749
COMMANDER GWON JUN
...will attack to secure a supply route

49:58.832 --> 50:01.084
to the western coast.

50:01.168 --> 50:03.170
The enemy's ground troops are gathered...

50:03.253 --> 50:05.756
COMMANDER SHIN HO
...at Geumsan near Jeonju Fortress.

50:05.839 --> 50:07.716
They will fight on two fronts at sea
and on land.

50:09.134 --> 50:11.887
They will attack both Jeonju Fortress
and the Left Jeolla Navy.

50:12.346 --> 50:14.473
If our navy falls as the enemy wishes,

50:14.556 --> 50:17.017
Joseon's regime in Uiju will also fall.

50:21.188 --> 50:25.317
We will surely face attack,
but Jeonju is under greater threat.

50:26.026 --> 50:27.444
The Battle of Yongin has left

50:27.528 --> 50:31.448
Chief Commander Lee Gwang
crippled by defeat.

50:32.658 --> 50:36.578
In any case,
we must alert Jeonju Fortress.

50:37.037 --> 50:40.499
Shouldn't we split our forces
to reinforce the army at Jeonju Fortress?

50:40.582 --> 50:44.294
Have you gone mad?
We cannot split the navy.

50:44.670 --> 50:46.213
Out of the question!

50:46.463 --> 50:48.966
Hold your anger. I merely speak as I must.

50:49.049 --> 50:50.342
Enough.

50:53.595 --> 50:54.930
Admiral Yi.

50:55.806 --> 50:57.641
How will you proceed?

51:22.833 --> 51:25.294
The time has come for a critical battle.

51:26.503 --> 51:27.546
Hence...

51:32.509 --> 51:35.804
tomorrow at midnight,
we shall set out to war.

51:36.972 --> 51:37.973
Prepare for deployment.

51:38.056 --> 51:39.725
Instead of defending?

51:55.616 --> 51:57.659
Load the shells and gunpowder!

51:58.619 --> 51:59.828
Careful!

52:03.916 --> 52:04.750
As ordered,

52:04.833 --> 52:06.960
GUNNERY MASTER LEE BONG-SU
we stockpiled all the gunpowder we could.

52:07.044 --> 52:08.295
Well done.

52:08.378 --> 52:11.965
Why do you need more than usual?

52:13.634 --> 52:14.968
For double-loading cannons

52:15.886 --> 52:20.474
with both shells and shrapnel shells.

52:21.808 --> 52:26.605
That will cause damage
only within short range.

52:27.314 --> 52:29.066
- The enemy ships will close in--
- Noted.

52:29.816 --> 52:33.070
Is Chief Nah on his way?

53:03.600 --> 53:07.062
Let's enjoy this drink together.

53:11.567 --> 53:12.818
By the way,

53:13.360 --> 53:16.029
what kind of man is this Admiral Yi?

53:16.321 --> 53:19.199
A surprisingly strong foe.

53:19.283 --> 53:22.494
That is why we must face him together.

53:23.245 --> 53:27.082
Joseon's commanders have been weak,
I heard.

53:27.791 --> 53:30.711
Yi must be the exception.

53:30.794 --> 53:35.174
Now that two war heroes have
joined us here,

53:35.757 --> 53:38.177
Yi will not stand a chance.

53:38.886 --> 53:43.390
This dull war will end sooner
than expected.

53:48.270 --> 53:49.313
Dono.

53:49.396 --> 53:52.691
We received word
from Kobayakawa's sixth division.

54:00.574 --> 54:02.284
Everyone out.

54:03.410 --> 54:04.661
Everyone out.

54:05.704 --> 54:09.333
Dither at your peril if you wish to die!

54:11.251 --> 54:12.461
Hurry up!

54:18.634 --> 54:22.721
Kobayakawa agreed to the inland attack
against the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

54:23.180 --> 54:24.431
In that case,

54:25.682 --> 54:26.892
when will he deploy?

54:27.017 --> 54:28.018
He asked

54:28.101 --> 54:31.647
that you decide when and send your reply.

54:34.316 --> 54:35.317
If so,

54:36.360 --> 54:38.070
we set out tonight at midnight.

54:40.447 --> 54:41.782
Absurd!

54:42.074 --> 54:45.035
You can't do so without consulting me!

54:46.995 --> 54:48.872
Wakizaka, please reconsider.

54:48.956 --> 54:51.458
For procedure's sake.

54:51.542 --> 54:54.294
We must attack
before the typhoon season arrives.

54:54.628 --> 54:56.004
Pardon the haste.

54:56.505 --> 54:57.673
You scoundrel!

55:00.634 --> 55:02.135
Stop!

55:08.350 --> 55:11.228
Your crude manner will cost you
my alliance.

55:11.311 --> 55:14.481
You take war too lightly, Wakizaka!

55:17.651 --> 55:19.695
Don't be rash,

55:20.445 --> 55:21.488
Kato.

55:22.531 --> 55:23.782
Sit down.

55:24.074 --> 55:25.492
Calm down.

55:25.576 --> 55:28.328
Kato. Put down your sword.

55:31.665 --> 55:33.333
I demand an answer.

55:33.417 --> 55:34.793
Tell me.

55:34.877 --> 55:37.212
Do you wish to join forces with me or not?

55:40.507 --> 55:42.050
Our dislike is mutual.

55:42.467 --> 55:43.802
However,

55:45.053 --> 55:47.890
the lord chancellor ordered
our joint attack.

55:49.474 --> 55:51.268
Withdraw your sword,

55:51.810 --> 55:54.813
and I'll overlook this outburst.

55:58.567 --> 55:59.693
Kato.

56:10.412 --> 56:11.371
Kato!

56:51.119 --> 56:52.287
You can come out now.

57:02.965 --> 57:05.300
Thank you. I heard crucial information.

57:05.384 --> 57:07.636
I must report back at once
to the Left Jeolla Navy.

57:14.309 --> 57:18.146
I've been watching you.

57:18.230 --> 57:21.108
So that wench slipped you in.

57:27.948 --> 57:29.324
Remarkable.

57:29.408 --> 57:33.453
Even the courtesans are spies.

57:33.704 --> 57:36.623
What a disappointment.

57:38.333 --> 57:40.377
I'd hoped to take you with me.

57:51.763 --> 57:53.182
Die!

57:53.891 --> 57:54.892
Dono!

58:00.647 --> 58:01.690
Stand back!

58:02.566 --> 58:03.692
Run!

58:12.910 --> 58:14.119
Sahei!

58:14.578 --> 58:16.038
After him! Now!

58:16.330 --> 58:17.456
You stay here!

58:19.333 --> 58:20.459
Follow me, Manabe!

58:27.341 --> 58:29.051
How much does he know?

58:29.718 --> 58:30.677
Tell me.

58:34.056 --> 58:36.892
There he is! By the shore!

58:37.851 --> 58:39.061
- Hurry.
- After him.

58:39.144 --> 58:40.812
Get in.

58:47.402 --> 58:48.487
Fire!

58:58.080 --> 58:59.665
Aim the fire arrows!

58:59.998 --> 59:01.250
Release!

59:06.296 --> 59:07.297
Release!

59:17.766 --> 59:18.725
No.

59:19.726 --> 59:21.311
Not until you spill everything you know.

59:28.986 --> 59:31.154
Dono, We've failed you.

59:31.864 --> 59:33.365
Please take our lives.

59:35.492 --> 59:37.369
Hunt down all the spies.

59:38.036 --> 59:39.246
Also,

59:40.372 --> 59:41.748
keep her alive.

59:56.263 --> 59:59.516
Please! I'm no spy!

1:00:00.225 --> 1:00:01.935
I'm not!

1:00:11.153 --> 1:00:12.779
Perhaps now is the time

1:00:13.363 --> 1:00:16.116
to break with the past,

1:00:17.326 --> 1:00:19.953
tying up all loose ends.

1:00:20.954 --> 1:00:23.040
Please don't kill me!

1:00:23.123 --> 1:00:24.082
Strike!

1:00:35.427 --> 1:00:38.430
DAY ONE, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

1:00:47.648 --> 1:00:51.068
We've reached Dangpo, our midway stopover.
Report to Admiral Yi.

1:00:51.151 --> 1:00:52.361
Yes, sir.

1:01:26.395 --> 1:01:28.355
We're allies! Stop!

1:01:28.564 --> 1:01:29.815
Kill him, too!

1:01:35.571 --> 1:01:37.406
Wakizaka!

1:02:06.602 --> 1:02:07.895
Tell me.

1:02:07.978 --> 1:02:10.147
Who is backing you?

1:02:10.439 --> 1:02:12.232
Is it Kanbei?

1:02:13.025 --> 1:02:15.402
Given our mutual hatred,

1:02:15.485 --> 1:02:17.988
you and I will only clash
if we join forces.

1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:21.033
Surrender your ships and begone.

1:02:21.491 --> 1:02:22.743
Do so,

1:02:24.036 --> 1:02:26.205
and I'll let you live.

1:02:27.206 --> 1:02:31.293
You expect to steal my iron-plated ship
without retribution?

1:02:39.551 --> 1:02:41.178
Mark my words.

1:02:41.261 --> 1:02:43.055
I will repay this insult.

1:02:50.854 --> 1:02:52.898
Now I know.

1:02:53.565 --> 1:02:57.069
From the start, you had this planned.

1:02:57.444 --> 1:03:00.197
But my ships won't matter.

1:03:06.495 --> 1:03:08.830
Begone if you care to live!

1:03:30.811 --> 1:03:33.272
Summoned by the lord chancellor,

1:03:33.355 --> 1:03:35.858
I've returned to Osaka Castle.

1:03:35.941 --> 1:03:39.653
Wakizaka, you shall now demolish
the Joseon navy

1:03:39.736 --> 1:03:42.823
and reach Ming China's Tianjin.

1:03:42.906 --> 1:03:45.117
Conquer the land!

1:03:45.534 --> 1:03:46.827
Once you do,

1:03:47.202 --> 1:03:49.705
the lord chancellor will bypass Joseon,

1:03:50.330 --> 1:03:54.084
proceeding straight to Ming.

1:03:55.419 --> 1:03:58.005
You shall be the one

1:03:58.088 --> 1:04:00.048
to welcome him there.

1:04:00.132 --> 1:04:04.052
The golden fan reflects
the lord chancellor's wishes.

1:04:04.136 --> 1:04:07.681
Treasure it.

1:04:11.977 --> 1:04:13.395
Brothers,

1:04:15.230 --> 1:04:19.610
we will overtake Konishi's 1st
and Kiyomasa's 2nd divisions

1:04:21.361 --> 1:04:23.572
as the first to reach Ming China.

1:04:23.864 --> 1:04:24.948
Dono!

1:04:25.407 --> 1:04:28.452
We congratulate you!

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:06.281
Row faster!

1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:17.709
Dono. Yi deployed his fleet.

1:05:17.793 --> 1:05:21.213
His ships are nearby, already at Dangpo.

1:05:25.926 --> 1:05:27.135
I see.

1:05:29.596 --> 1:05:31.849
A strong foe indeed.

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:45.195
Between Dangpo

1:05:46.905 --> 1:05:48.574
and our current base Ungpo.

1:05:50.909 --> 1:05:52.452
Look here.

1:05:55.706 --> 1:05:59.543
This narrow sea route between us,
Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

1:05:59.835 --> 1:06:02.421
GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

1:06:03.338 --> 1:06:04.840
Are you reminded of anywhere?

1:06:05.632 --> 1:06:07.217
In the Battle of Yongin,

1:06:07.426 --> 1:06:09.887
there was a narrow pass
en route to Hanyang.

1:06:10.304 --> 1:06:12.222
In Gwanggyosan, was it not?

1:06:15.601 --> 1:06:18.812
We'll sail to Gyeonnaeryang,
lying in ambush.

1:06:20.856 --> 1:06:23.192
We'll wait for Yi's next move.

1:06:25.652 --> 1:06:27.613
- Now go.
- Yes, sir!

1:06:36.997 --> 1:06:40.125
DANGPO, JOSEON NAVY'S MIDWAY STOPOVER

1:06:42.419 --> 1:06:44.922
I've sworn allegiance to Admiral Yi.

1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:49.718
There is no time. You must go alone now.

1:06:51.303 --> 1:06:55.182
Many lives were lost
to secure that report.

1:06:55.682 --> 1:07:00.479
Deliver it without fail to Admiral Yi.

1:07:20.874 --> 1:07:23.252
Hurry! We must pass Ungchi!

1:07:29.591 --> 1:07:32.427
Ungchi... leads
to the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

1:07:34.137 --> 1:07:36.431
Hurry the rear guard! There is no time!

1:07:38.433 --> 1:07:41.019
The shortcut to Jeonju Fortress is
this way...

1:08:05.669 --> 1:08:08.088
DANGPO, JOSEON NAVY'S MIDWAY STOPOVER

1:08:08.589 --> 1:08:11.091
We've checked these areas.

1:08:11.175 --> 1:08:14.094
Now we're searching
near Angolpo and Ungpo--

1:08:14.178 --> 1:08:18.765
So, have you located
the hidden enemy fleet?

1:08:20.934 --> 1:08:22.394
We will, soon enough.

1:08:22.477 --> 1:08:25.439
I was loath to turn my back so soon

1:08:25.522 --> 1:08:28.734
immediately upon arrival yesterday.

1:08:28.817 --> 1:08:32.404
But if the enemy is not found today,

1:08:32.487 --> 1:08:37.075
I will withdraw my men
to help defend Jeonju Fortress.

1:08:38.076 --> 1:08:40.787
We'll locate them today.

1:08:45.209 --> 1:08:47.377
Admiral. We've found the enemy.

1:08:47.920 --> 1:08:50.214
- Where?
- Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

1:08:53.217 --> 1:08:55.844
Gyeonnaeryang is nearby.

1:08:56.178 --> 1:08:58.847
Around 100 Wae ships are docked there.

1:09:04.978 --> 1:09:08.065
GYEONNAERYANG
DANGPO

1:09:12.027 --> 1:09:13.570
We must attack at once.

1:09:13.654 --> 1:09:15.239
Fortune is on our side.

1:09:15.906 --> 1:09:17.824
They're docked at Gyeonnaeryang

1:09:18.450 --> 1:09:22.079
because they know
our fleet has sailed out to these shores.

1:09:22.162 --> 1:09:24.623
That changes nothing.

1:09:25.249 --> 1:09:26.667
We must be cautious.

1:09:34.842 --> 1:09:36.218
Remove the other tables.

1:09:36.301 --> 1:09:37.302
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1:09:48.063 --> 1:09:52.150
We must lure them here
to the open sea of Hansan.

1:09:52.234 --> 1:09:53.652
Gyeonnaeryang is too narrow.

1:09:53.735 --> 1:09:57.155
Our panokseon warships
cannot battle there.

1:09:57.364 --> 1:09:58.615
I disagree.

1:09:59.074 --> 1:10:00.909
Narrow or not,

1:10:00.993 --> 1:10:06.164
it'll be easier to attack
while the enemy is docked.

1:10:06.957 --> 1:10:10.752
Wouldn't our previous battle formations
suit the circumstances?

1:10:11.879 --> 1:10:17.301
Strong currents in the strait will hinder
our ships' movement.

1:10:17.885 --> 1:10:19.887
Many will be destroyed.

1:10:20.387 --> 1:10:23.390
Also, the attack may be ineffective

1:10:23.473 --> 1:10:25.142
if the enemy flees to shore.

1:10:26.935 --> 1:10:30.105
A leader in war should not shy away

1:10:30.189 --> 1:10:32.274
from small damages.

1:10:32.357 --> 1:10:34.651
And if the enemy flees to shore,

1:10:34.735 --> 1:10:38.197
they can only run to Geojedo Island.

1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:41.325
Since they'll be cut off
from reinforcement,

1:10:41.742 --> 1:10:46.038
we can hunt them down
for a rare victory on land.

1:10:46.121 --> 1:10:48.123
I say we strike at them.

1:10:48.999 --> 1:10:50.876
In that case,

1:10:50.959 --> 1:10:54.213
why don't you take lead
with the first attack?

1:10:54.296 --> 1:10:55.297
What?

1:10:56.256 --> 1:10:59.468
You want only my ships to get battered
and destroyed in vain?

1:11:02.221 --> 1:11:06.058
I want you to lure the enemy ships
to this open sea of Hansan.

1:11:07.768 --> 1:11:10.103
Lure out the fleet?

1:11:13.065 --> 1:11:14.483
To battle

1:11:16.109 --> 1:11:18.195
in crane wing formation?

1:11:20.614 --> 1:11:24.701
Is that what you meant
by a barrier on the sea?

1:11:26.161 --> 1:11:28.872
But I'm no fool.

1:11:28.956 --> 1:11:31.333
I can't attack
with only seven ships in my fleet.

1:11:31.416 --> 1:11:33.794
That's a suicide mission.

1:11:33.877 --> 1:11:36.839
Wakizaka is no fool either.

1:11:36.922 --> 1:11:39.132
You think he'll be lured so easily?

1:11:39.675 --> 1:11:42.219
I'll take no part in this reckless plan.

1:11:43.387 --> 1:11:44.471
Admiral Won!

1:11:45.514 --> 1:11:47.599
The enemy is right before us.

1:11:48.767 --> 1:11:51.061
A barrier on the sea? Nonsense!

1:11:51.144 --> 1:11:53.981
I'll help defend Jeonju Fortress instead.

1:11:54.314 --> 1:11:56.525
As a hyangdo (naval guide),
I can lure the enemy.

1:12:02.322 --> 1:12:06.535
I know the waterways around Gyeonnaeryang.

1:12:07.744 --> 1:12:09.621
Let me lure the enemy.

1:12:10.956 --> 1:12:12.207
I shall go instead.

1:12:16.628 --> 1:12:20.299
The task should not fall
to the elderly commander.

1:12:20.382 --> 1:12:22.426
It is not befitting.

1:12:23.552 --> 1:12:26.930
Please. Send me instead.

1:12:27.139 --> 1:12:29.892
Admiral, I agree.

1:12:30.559 --> 1:12:33.645
CAPTAIN LEE YEONG-NAM
Please send us instead.

1:12:34.062 --> 1:12:37.608
I see you two are now serving Admiral Yi.

1:12:39.359 --> 1:12:40.527
Admiral.

1:12:41.486 --> 1:12:43.906
It's the last wish of an old commander.

1:12:44.364 --> 1:12:45.824
Please grant it.

1:12:54.166 --> 1:12:56.543
CRANE WING FORMATION PLAN

1:12:56.627 --> 1:12:59.046
A barrier on the sea? Nonsense!

1:12:59.880 --> 1:13:02.424
What is your battle plan?

1:13:02.925 --> 1:13:06.678
Will the crane wing formation
ensure victory?

1:13:18.398 --> 1:13:21.276
CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

1:13:21.735 --> 1:13:24.279
Admiral. Sergeant Song reporting.

1:13:26.532 --> 1:13:27.658
Come in.

1:13:29.993 --> 1:13:31.203
What brings you here?

1:13:34.706 --> 1:13:37.417
A report requiring secrecy.

1:13:38.669 --> 1:13:40.504
It's from Junsa.

1:13:52.975 --> 1:13:54.893
Kobayakawa's troops left Geumsan to attack

1:13:54.977 --> 1:13:58.021
the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters,
not Jeonju Fortress.

1:13:58.438 --> 1:14:00.190
The enemy's army and navy

1:14:00.607 --> 1:14:02.985
will strike in unison.

1:14:03.694 --> 1:14:06.864
Their fleet was deployed
on the fifth at midnight.

1:14:08.323 --> 1:14:11.034
If their ground troops bypass
Jeonju Fortress

1:14:11.118 --> 1:14:12.578
to strike our headquarters,

1:14:12.995 --> 1:14:14.454
it will be a critical blow.

1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:16.915
Have you alerted Jeonju Fortress?

1:14:16.999 --> 1:14:19.293
Junsa is on his way to alert them.

1:14:20.169 --> 1:14:21.378
If so,

1:14:21.461 --> 1:14:25.716
who delivered this report instead of him?

1:14:38.270 --> 1:14:40.105
UNGCHI PASS

1:14:40.189 --> 1:14:42.274
Fasten the cannons tightly!

1:14:42.357 --> 1:14:44.359
I don't trust the anti-Wae fighter.

1:14:44.443 --> 1:14:46.111
ANTI-WAE FIGHTER:
FORMER WAE SOLDIER FIGHTING FOR JOSEON

1:14:46.195 --> 1:14:48.697
Why would the enemy bypass Jeonju Fortress

1:14:48.780 --> 1:14:50.407
to attack the navy headquarters?

1:14:50.490 --> 1:14:53.160
Let's get rid of that anti-Wae fighter

1:14:53.243 --> 1:14:55.746
and march to Jeonju as planned.

1:14:55.829 --> 1:14:57.748
RIGHTEOUS MILITIA COMMANDER, HWANG BAK
Once the enemy passes Ungchi,

1:14:57.831 --> 1:15:00.083
it's only a half-day's march
to the navy headquarters.

1:15:00.459 --> 1:15:02.628
We'll receive orders soon.

1:15:02.711 --> 1:15:05.255
Until then, we must defend this pass.

1:15:33.992 --> 1:15:35.452
So you're the anti-Wae fighter?

1:15:36.662 --> 1:15:37.871
Follow me.

1:16:00.185 --> 1:16:01.979
If we survive this,

1:16:03.272 --> 1:16:05.649
I'll treat you to a hearty drink.

1:16:16.451 --> 1:16:17.452
Wait.

1:16:26.628 --> 1:16:28.422
No need for that.

1:16:29.673 --> 1:16:32.968
A shared, righteous spirit.
That's all you need.

1:16:33.844 --> 1:16:35.679
Get some armor instead.

1:16:48.901 --> 1:16:52.029
CRANE WING FORMATION PLAN

1:17:03.790 --> 1:17:08.253
We will use the enemy's attack
to surround their fleet.

1:17:08.670 --> 1:17:13.050
In the sea of Hansan,
we will battle in crane wing formation.

1:17:14.551 --> 1:17:17.012
Flanking the flagship

1:17:17.095 --> 1:17:20.265
on the right wing's center will be
Admiral Lee Eok-gi.

1:17:21.225 --> 1:17:23.018
On the left wing's center,

1:17:29.358 --> 1:17:31.276
there will be Admiral Won.

1:17:32.861 --> 1:17:36.532
By his side,
there'll be the wise Commander Eo,

1:17:36.615 --> 1:17:40.661
the hyangdo (naval guide)
well versed in Joseon's waterways.

1:17:41.161 --> 1:17:45.624
Commander Lee Un-ryong,
who offers trustworthy counsel,

1:17:45.707 --> 1:17:49.044
shall be next to him.

1:17:49.753 --> 1:17:52.923
Captain Kim Wan,
who maneuvers with great skill,

1:17:53.006 --> 1:17:56.969
will be at the tip of the left wing.

1:17:57.886 --> 1:18:00.097
Commander Gwon Jun

1:18:00.180 --> 1:18:04.017
has the speed and strength
to wage close combat

1:18:04.101 --> 1:18:05.978
at the tip of the right wing.

1:18:07.062 --> 1:18:11.275
As a proven warrior who leads
our navy's most forceful charges,

1:18:11.358 --> 1:18:13.569
Commander Jung Un will be...

1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:48.145
TO CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

1:19:11.835 --> 1:19:14.880
Were all ships ordered
to double-load their cannons?

1:19:14.963 --> 1:19:16.006
Yes, sir.

1:19:16.089 --> 1:19:19.510
We gave orders to double-load shells
and shrapnel shells.

1:19:26.141 --> 1:19:28.810
Prepare for deployment.

1:19:29.394 --> 1:19:30.395
Yes, sir.

1:19:49.581 --> 1:19:51.583
All ships to war.

1:19:52.334 --> 1:19:55.921
All ships!

1:19:56.255 --> 1:19:57.631
To war!

1:19:57.714 --> 1:19:58.715
To war!

1:19:58.799 --> 1:19:59.675
To war!

1:19:59.758 --> 1:20:00.592
To war!

1:20:00.676 --> 1:20:02.845
- To war!
- To war!

1:20:10.727 --> 1:20:16.441
DAY FOUR, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
BATTLE OF HANSAN ISLAND

1:20:17.985 --> 1:20:23.115
GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

1:20:31.623 --> 1:20:35.252
Dono! Yi has deployed his fleet.

1:20:35.544 --> 1:20:38.463
Fifty six ships set sail from Dangpo.
All panokseon warships,

1:20:38.547 --> 1:20:41.300
no mekurabune (blind ship) to be seen.

1:20:42.926 --> 1:20:45.137
Could it be a deception?

1:20:45.387 --> 1:20:47.097
Never mind the mekurabune.

1:20:58.984 --> 1:21:00.986
You two will wait in ambush
on the right and left flanks.

1:21:01.069 --> 1:21:02.154
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1:21:27.179 --> 1:21:29.806
We must lure out the enemy.

1:21:30.641 --> 1:21:34.353
Stay at least 200 yards away
from their ships.

1:21:34.436 --> 1:21:35.562
Yes, sir.

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:48.075
Lower the anchor!

1:21:52.704 --> 1:21:56.375
LEFT FLANK
MANABE SAMANOSUKE

1:21:59.253 --> 1:22:02.464
RIGHT FLANK
WATANABE SHICHIEMON

1:22:17.729 --> 1:22:19.857
Enemy ships! Enemy ships ahead!

1:22:30.284 --> 1:22:32.995
Hold fire! Find the enemy ships!

1:22:43.839 --> 1:22:44.923
Fire!

1:22:46.008 --> 1:22:47.843
Rank two, prepare to fire!

1:22:48.927 --> 1:22:51.680
Sahei. How many ships?

1:22:52.848 --> 1:22:54.516
We cannot count yet.

1:22:55.726 --> 1:22:57.019
Hold positions.

1:22:57.102 --> 1:22:59.938
Keep the enemy at bay by returning fire.

1:23:00.022 --> 1:23:02.357
Deplete their firepower.

1:23:02.441 --> 1:23:05.777
- Yes, sir!
- To the right! Fire!

1:23:08.155 --> 1:23:10.365
Hold fire!

1:23:24.171 --> 1:23:27.257
To the left! They're on the left!

1:23:29.468 --> 1:23:30.886
Fire!

1:23:42.606 --> 1:23:46.860
Commander Manabe on the left flank
asks if he may attack.

1:23:48.862 --> 1:23:51.323
Commander Watanabe on the right flank
asks the same.

1:23:51.615 --> 1:23:54.952
Tell them to stay in position
and hold fire.

1:23:55.035 --> 1:23:56.912
They must wait in ambush.

1:23:57.204 --> 1:23:58.205
Yes, sir!

1:24:06.296 --> 1:24:08.590
Commander. I will reverse the ship.

1:24:08.799 --> 1:24:10.926
Advance 100 yards.

1:24:11.009 --> 1:24:12.344
We should stop here.

1:24:12.427 --> 1:24:14.263
We'll be surrounded by the enemy!

1:24:14.346 --> 1:24:17.224
At this rate, the enemy won't budge.

1:24:17.474 --> 1:24:20.769
We must deliver a blow to lure them out.

1:24:20.978 --> 1:24:22.145
Row forward!

1:24:23.105 --> 1:24:24.147
Yes, sir!

1:24:29.820 --> 1:24:35.158
OUTSIDE GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

1:24:42.708 --> 1:24:44.543
Will the enemy be lured?

1:24:53.719 --> 1:24:57.097
Deploy the ships on standby.

1:24:57.723 --> 1:24:59.308
Yes, sir.

1:25:24.333 --> 1:25:26.710
Commander! The fog is clearing.

1:25:26.793 --> 1:25:29.630
We're running low on gunpowder and shells.
We must retreat!

1:25:35.135 --> 1:25:38.096
Cannon fire! They're firing cannons!

1:25:39.181 --> 1:25:40.682
Firing cannons?

1:25:54.488 --> 1:25:55.781
Fire!

1:26:02.579 --> 1:26:05.666
The fog is clearing! We can see the ships!

1:26:07.751 --> 1:26:09.419
Only three ships.

1:26:09.503 --> 1:26:11.713
How daring, Yi Sun-shin.

1:26:12.381 --> 1:26:15.717
You shall soon regret
leaving your headquarters.

1:26:17.761 --> 1:26:21.348
Wae ships on the right!

1:26:29.356 --> 1:26:30.774
It's an ambush!

1:26:36.738 --> 1:26:38.365
A brave move.

1:26:40.117 --> 1:26:43.370
But three ships aren't enough to lure us.

1:26:43.453 --> 1:26:46.623
How will Yi respond

1:26:47.165 --> 1:26:49.543
once they've burned down?

1:26:50.460 --> 1:26:51.879
I wonder.

1:27:09.813 --> 1:27:10.814
It's too late.

1:27:10.898 --> 1:27:12.524
Prepare for close combat.

1:27:27.831 --> 1:27:29.499
Dono, enemy ships on the left!

1:27:46.016 --> 1:27:47.976
Sir! They're Joseon ships.

1:27:56.109 --> 1:27:57.861
COMMANDER LEE UN-RYONG

1:28:03.700 --> 1:28:05.953
Row at full speed! We must retreat!

1:28:10.749 --> 1:28:13.919
Row faster! We must retreat!

1:28:14.461 --> 1:28:16.672
Chase after them at full speed.

1:28:16.755 --> 1:28:18.131
Close in!

1:28:18.799 --> 1:28:20.342
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

1:28:24.346 --> 1:28:25.222
Sahei!

1:28:25.764 --> 1:28:29.059
Signal Manabe at once to stop his chase.

1:28:29.142 --> 1:28:31.603
He must not leave Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

1:28:31.687 --> 1:28:32.729
Yes, sir!

1:28:40.112 --> 1:28:41.947
Sir, over there!

1:28:43.657 --> 1:28:44.908
Orders to stop!

1:28:46.201 --> 1:28:47.661
What do we do, sir?

1:28:47.744 --> 1:28:49.079
Our sword is drawn.

1:28:49.162 --> 1:28:51.874
We'll catch them here in Gyeonnaeryang.

1:28:51.957 --> 1:28:54.001
It's what the general wants. After them!

1:29:09.975 --> 1:29:13.228
Their main fleet isn't joining the attack.

1:29:24.072 --> 1:29:25.407
Rotate starboard!

1:29:25.824 --> 1:29:27.576
Rotate starboard!

1:29:34.791 --> 1:29:37.211
Throw the grapnel! Board the ship!

1:29:53.936 --> 1:29:56.146
Our ships are hitting the rocks.

1:29:56.772 --> 1:29:59.399
No matter,
we'll board enemy ships instead.

1:29:59.900 --> 1:30:01.360
Close in!

1:30:06.740 --> 1:30:09.284
To port! Rotate to port!

1:30:40.607 --> 1:30:43.402
My word. How is this possible?

1:30:44.862 --> 1:30:46.113
Fire!

1:30:46.405 --> 1:30:47.739
Fire!

1:31:02.129 --> 1:31:03.547
Manabe.

1:31:04.214 --> 1:31:05.382
Dono.

1:31:17.728 --> 1:31:20.731
Admiral! We received report
from Gyeonnaeryang.

1:31:20.814 --> 1:31:23.066
Commander Lee's ships entered the strait,

1:31:23.150 --> 1:31:26.778
but the enemy's main fleet
has yet to be lured.

1:31:31.200 --> 1:31:33.368
All ships
to the mouth of Gyeonnaeryang Strait

1:31:33.452 --> 1:31:35.245
in arrowhead formation.

1:31:35.329 --> 1:31:36.455
Raise the command flag.

1:31:36.538 --> 1:31:37.539
Admiral.

1:31:37.623 --> 1:31:40.167
If the enemy attacks head-on,
we could be in danger.

1:31:41.168 --> 1:31:42.794
The current is against us.

1:31:42.878 --> 1:31:44.213
We need them to attack.

1:31:44.630 --> 1:31:45.964
Raise the flag.

1:31:47.341 --> 1:31:48.467
Yes, sir.

1:31:49.635 --> 1:31:51.136
Raise the flag!

1:32:15.827 --> 1:32:16.954
Dono.

1:32:17.037 --> 1:32:19.456
The enemy's main fleet has arrived!

1:32:26.672 --> 1:32:28.632
All ships, stop!

1:32:29.424 --> 1:32:31.218
All ships, stop!

1:33:06.128 --> 1:33:10.757
By now,
Kobayakawa will have passed Ungchi.

1:33:29.151 --> 1:33:31.904
Fire the cannons!

1:33:47.669 --> 1:33:49.004
We need more arrows!

1:33:49.087 --> 1:33:51.256
Our hillside flank has fallen.

1:33:52.216 --> 1:33:53.717
We're far outnumbered!

1:33:57.137 --> 1:33:59.765
Fall back to line two!

1:34:01.099 --> 1:34:02.809
Charge!

1:34:09.566 --> 1:34:12.653
Line two cannot hold.

1:34:12.986 --> 1:34:15.864
We must retreat to line three.

1:34:17.741 --> 1:34:21.495
That'll be the end for us
and the navy headquarters.

1:34:21.578 --> 1:34:24.540
No! For all of Jeolla-do!

1:34:25.415 --> 1:34:27.417
Charge!

1:34:35.425 --> 1:34:37.970
Enemy ships! The enemy is advancing!

1:35:08.876 --> 1:35:12.629
Rotate all ships. Reinforce rowers.

1:35:15.215 --> 1:35:17.926
All rowers to oars!

1:35:18.552 --> 1:35:20.554
Add rowers!

1:35:27.102 --> 1:35:29.813
Rotate the ship!

1:35:30.564 --> 1:35:33.108
Get ready to fire!

1:35:34.818 --> 1:35:37.196
Sir! It's the command kite.

1:35:41.074 --> 1:35:42.993
We must join the formation!

1:35:43.076 --> 1:35:45.078
Row harder!

1:35:46.747 --> 1:35:48.081
CRANE WING

1:35:50.667 --> 1:35:53.253
Add rowers. Full speed ahead!

1:35:53.337 --> 1:35:55.631
- Speed ensures victory!
- Yes, sir!

1:35:55.714 --> 1:35:57.591
Add more oars!

1:36:00.219 --> 1:36:02.429
Row faster!

1:36:02.513 --> 1:36:04.306
Faster!

1:36:08.060 --> 1:36:10.395
Row with all your might!

1:36:10.479 --> 1:36:12.272
Faster!

1:36:12.773 --> 1:36:14.525
We must sail faster!

1:36:20.197 --> 1:36:23.617
I will avenge Manabe
by destroying you myself.

1:36:25.244 --> 1:36:27.371
Wae ships are closing in!

1:36:27.454 --> 1:36:29.039
Fire!

1:36:34.086 --> 1:36:35.420
Shoot the arrows!

1:36:44.513 --> 1:36:46.974
Admiral. They're grappling our ship!

1:36:51.562 --> 1:36:52.938
Cut the ropes!

1:36:55.107 --> 1:36:57.192
We must return to formation.

1:37:11.248 --> 1:37:14.042
Sir! Commanders Eo Young-dam
and Lee Un-ryong are under attack.

1:37:23.510 --> 1:37:24.386
Sir!

1:37:24.469 --> 1:37:26.763
Cover for him!

1:37:28.056 --> 1:37:30.392
- Commander Eo.
- Follow me!

1:37:44.656 --> 1:37:48.744
Crane wing formation. As expected.

1:37:50.287 --> 1:37:52.706
Sahei can battle those ships

1:37:52.789 --> 1:37:54.875
while we charge in fish-scale formation.

1:37:54.958 --> 1:37:57.252
Fish-scale formation!

1:37:57.336 --> 1:37:58.712
Fish-scale formation!

1:38:23.362 --> 1:38:25.030
Watanabe reports from the front rank

1:38:25.113 --> 1:38:28.617
that he will charge at the ships
lagging behind at the right wing.

1:38:28.700 --> 1:38:30.577
He thinks just like me.

1:38:30.661 --> 1:38:32.913
Tell him I permit the attack.

1:38:32.996 --> 1:38:34.122
Yes, sir!

1:38:38.794 --> 1:38:39.878
Hurry!

1:38:39.962 --> 1:38:43.257
Row backward and load the cannons!

1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:45.175
Fire!

1:38:49.888 --> 1:38:51.932
What in the world is he thinking?

1:38:52.015 --> 1:38:54.560
He's firing without order
despite the waves.

1:38:54.643 --> 1:38:56.270
He should know better!

1:38:59.815 --> 1:39:01.066
The enemy ships are too fast.

1:39:01.900 --> 1:39:04.319
We should've attacked sooner.

1:39:04.403 --> 1:39:05.988
You blasted Yi Sun-shin,

1:39:06.071 --> 1:39:08.115
why aren't you firing?

1:39:11.118 --> 1:39:14.538
Admiral Won's ships are weakening
our formation.

1:39:14.621 --> 1:39:16.665
Please give order to fire.

1:39:19.543 --> 1:39:21.628
Please give order, sir!

1:39:24.464 --> 1:39:27.009
Before firing,
we must complete the formation.

1:39:29.178 --> 1:39:31.013
In the Battle of Mikatagahara,

1:39:31.096 --> 1:39:35.392
Takeda Shingen destroyed
Tokugawa's crane wing formation

1:39:35.475 --> 1:39:39.188
not by swords or guns.

1:39:39.855 --> 1:39:42.733
He crushed it with cavalry.

1:39:44.067 --> 1:39:45.777
Charge forth, Watanabe.

1:39:46.069 --> 1:39:48.989
You and I will crush the foe

1:39:49.573 --> 1:39:52.826
as we did at Gwanggyosan!

1:39:59.541 --> 1:40:01.084
Charge forth.

1:40:01.168 --> 1:40:03.545
You're not the only ones
with ramming ships.

1:40:03.629 --> 1:40:07.799
Behold the might of our antaekseon
(WAE large warship).

1:40:18.519 --> 1:40:22.731
Your crane will fall
before spreading its wings.

1:40:28.654 --> 1:40:30.072
We've caught you now.

1:41:35.929 --> 1:41:37.431
Mekurabune (blind ship).

1:41:57.701 --> 1:41:59.661
It's the mekurabune!

1:42:02.998 --> 1:42:04.082
Dono!

1:42:09.630 --> 1:42:10.964
Bring the large gun!

1:42:11.048 --> 1:42:12.174
Now!

1:42:47.584 --> 1:42:49.378
It's the mekurabune!

1:43:27.374 --> 1:43:29.877
Row harder!

1:43:31.253 --> 1:43:32.921
Prepare to fire!

1:43:34.631 --> 1:43:36.175
Row harder!

1:43:47.436 --> 1:43:50.147
That flagship is shielded by iron plates.

1:43:50.689 --> 1:43:53.025
Rotate to port and ram its stern.

1:44:01.158 --> 1:44:02.201
It's slow.

1:44:03.327 --> 1:44:05.954
Nothing but a blind mekurabune.

1:44:06.622 --> 1:44:08.957
Charge toward Yi's flagship!
Signal the fleet!

1:44:09.041 --> 1:44:10.083
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1:44:10.167 --> 1:44:11.919
We'll go to the stern chaser.

1:44:12.002 --> 1:44:13.587
I'll fire it myself.

1:44:19.510 --> 1:44:20.802
The sides were its weakness.

1:44:20.886 --> 1:44:22.554
It will rotate for sure.

1:44:22.638 --> 1:44:24.515
I'll aim for the side.

1:44:28.101 --> 1:44:30.020
Take fire, mekurabune.

1:44:33.315 --> 1:44:34.608
Fire!

1:44:40.489 --> 1:44:42.658
Right cannon, fire!

1:44:46.245 --> 1:44:47.788
Aim!

1:44:47.871 --> 1:44:49.289
Fire!

1:45:10.394 --> 1:45:11.353
Dono,

1:45:11.436 --> 1:45:14.773
the mekurabune is closing in sideways
out of our firing range.

1:45:17.609 --> 1:45:18.652
Aim!

1:45:34.376 --> 1:45:35.544
Sahei.

1:45:42.968 --> 1:45:44.678
My trusty cousin.

1:45:45.137 --> 1:45:46.388
Fire!

1:45:52.227 --> 1:45:54.354
Wait and see, Yi Sun-shin.

1:45:54.438 --> 1:45:58.066
your mekurabune shall be your fall.

1:46:19.379 --> 1:46:20.756
That one has a lower hull,

1:46:20.839 --> 1:46:22.966
harder to target.

1:46:23.050 --> 1:46:24.801
The mekurabune is charging at us!

1:46:25.093 --> 1:46:26.595
Good.

1:46:26.678 --> 1:46:30.349
Charge at us with all your might,
mekurabune.

1:46:30.432 --> 1:46:34.311
Once you do,
your head will be lodged in my ship.

1:46:37.397 --> 1:46:39.525
Prepare to board!

1:47:31.994 --> 1:47:33.453
Bokkaisen (sea monster).

1:47:38.375 --> 1:47:39.960
Dono!

1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:03.942
Admiral.

1:48:04.026 --> 1:48:08.155
The new turtle ship will achieve
more than ramming.

1:48:08.947 --> 1:48:10.073
Please.

1:48:11.366 --> 1:48:13.243
Deploy the turtle ship.

1:48:20.417 --> 1:48:21.835
Yi Sun-shin.

1:48:21.919 --> 1:48:25.088
Was this your final ploy?

1:48:30.177 --> 1:48:32.638
Admiral. Thanks to the new turtle ship,

1:48:32.721 --> 1:48:36.099
Commanders Eo Hyang-do and Lee Un-ryong
have returned to formation.

1:48:46.568 --> 1:48:47.444
Admiral.

1:48:47.528 --> 1:48:49.154
The enemy ships are near.

1:48:49.238 --> 1:48:50.781
We must open fire.

1:48:55.202 --> 1:48:56.203
Admiral!

1:49:10.551 --> 1:49:13.011
Why is the turtle ship still
in their midst?

1:49:15.222 --> 1:49:17.808
The mekurabune is charging at us!

1:49:33.949 --> 1:49:37.578
Two hundred yards away.
We can overtake them.

1:49:39.496 --> 1:49:41.582
All ships!

1:49:41.665 --> 1:49:45.127
Break formation!

1:49:45.210 --> 1:49:47.880
Engage the enemy!

1:50:05.606 --> 1:50:06.732
Aim!

1:50:10.777 --> 1:50:12.988
What in the world is he thinking?

1:50:13.071 --> 1:50:14.531
The enemy is right before us.

1:50:14.615 --> 1:50:15.991
We can't wait any longer!

1:50:16.074 --> 1:50:17.743
Fire immediately!

1:50:17.826 --> 1:50:20.329
Sir, we're out of shells.

1:50:26.793 --> 1:50:27.794
Admiral.

1:50:28.420 --> 1:50:31.006
We must win this battle.

1:50:32.090 --> 1:50:33.759
Please fire.

1:50:39.932 --> 1:50:41.225
One hundred yards.

1:51:00.118 --> 1:51:01.286
Fifty yards.

1:51:08.502 --> 1:51:10.045
Raise the ladders!

1:51:12.256 --> 1:51:13.757
All ships.

1:51:21.932 --> 1:51:24.476
Raise them!

1:51:24.977 --> 1:51:26.311
Rotate.

1:51:27.187 --> 1:51:29.481
Rotate!

1:51:29.565 --> 1:51:32.192
Port oars, stop!

1:51:37.906 --> 1:51:40.450
Starboard oars, row harder!

1:51:51.044 --> 1:51:53.881
Starboard oars, row harder!

1:51:53.964 --> 1:51:56.175
Too late, Yi Sun-shin.

1:51:58.010 --> 1:52:00.220
Row harder!

1:52:18.530 --> 1:52:20.282
Board their ships!

1:52:27.873 --> 1:52:29.291
Fire.

1:52:59.154 --> 1:53:01.281
A barrier on the sea.

1:56:19.104 --> 1:56:23.400
Admiral, you have to shoot now!

1:56:45.380 --> 1:56:47.925
Admiral!

1:57:16.703 --> 1:57:18.247
A trap!

1:57:18.872 --> 1:57:20.249
Fire!

1:58:14.928 --> 1:58:18.599
Stop them!

1:58:28.734 --> 1:58:30.402
We must not let them pass!

1:58:30.485 --> 1:58:32.237
Fight to the death!

1:58:36.867 --> 1:58:38.911
What the hell are you?

1:58:43.165 --> 1:58:48.086
I wanted to treat you to a hearty drink.

1:58:49.087 --> 1:58:51.423
It's too bad I can't.

1:58:52.216 --> 1:58:53.467
Move!

1:58:56.261 --> 1:58:57.971
You invaders will not

1:58:58.972 --> 1:59:01.517
go beyond this Ungchi Pass.

1:59:11.818 --> 1:59:14.154
We must guard this place...

1:59:22.788 --> 1:59:25.541
RIGHTEOUS MILITIA COMMANDER, HWANG JIN
Charge!

1:59:26.416 --> 1:59:28.126
What did I tell you?

1:59:28.210 --> 1:59:30.212
It's a righteous battle.

1:59:32.214 --> 1:59:33.841
Fought together

1:59:34.716 --> 1:59:36.718
with a shared spirit.

1:59:38.762 --> 1:59:40.138
Yours as well.

1:59:41.390 --> 1:59:43.058
I'm thankful for it.

1:59:58.073 --> 2:00:01.410
What is this war?

2:00:02.995 --> 2:00:05.581
A battle of the righteous
against the unrighteous.

2:00:06.665 --> 2:00:08.709
The enemy is fleeing!

2:00:09.251 --> 2:00:11.295
Chase after them!

2:00:16.675 --> 2:00:19.970
RIGHTEOUS

2:01:17.236 --> 2:01:23.242
FOLLOW

2:02:09.788 --> 2:02:13.208
Admiral. It is a total triumph.

2:02:15.294 --> 2:02:16.295
No.

2:02:23.468 --> 2:02:25.012
Let us press on.

2:02:26.180 --> 2:02:27.598
What Joseon needs

2:02:28.682 --> 2:02:30.767
is a decisive victory.

2:02:35.606 --> 2:02:39.401
DAY SIX, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
ANGOLPO, NEAR BUSAN

2:02:48.452 --> 2:02:53.624
DAY SEVEN, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
BUSANPO, FINAL BATTLEGROUND

2:03:09.723 --> 2:03:11.725
WAE NAVAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF
AT BUSANPO, TODO TAKATORA

2:03:45.467 --> 2:03:47.719
ON JULY 11, 1592,

2:03:47.803 --> 2:03:51.348
ADMIRAL YI ENDED HIS THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
WITH A CANNONADE ON THE ENEMY AT BUSANPO.

2:03:51.431 --> 2:03:56.478
HASHIBA (TOYOTOMI) HIDEYOSHI QUIT
HIS PLANS TO DEFEAT JOSEON'S NAVY.

2:03:56.562 --> 2:04:00.941
THIS SAFEGUARDED MING TO THE WEST
AND REVERSED THE TIDE OF WAR.

2:04:03.026 --> 2:04:05.404
What made you bring me here, sir?

2:04:08.156 --> 2:04:12.160
A YEAR LATER, HANSANDO ISLAND

2:04:13.370 --> 2:04:15.205
Look at Geojedo Island.

2:04:16.248 --> 2:04:19.710
The island is facing
the mouth of enemy waters.

2:04:22.337 --> 2:04:25.215
We must secure tighter control
over this sea.

2:04:28.844 --> 2:04:30.345
I agree, sir.

2:04:31.430 --> 2:04:33.640
Thanks to our previous victory
in these waters,

2:04:33.849 --> 2:04:36.560
the enemy at Busanpo

2:04:37.811 --> 2:04:40.814
has yet to reappear
around Hansando Island.

2:04:42.399 --> 2:04:44.401
I admire the name.

2:04:45.694 --> 2:04:46.987
Hansan.

2:04:49.865 --> 2:04:53.619
Indeed, it's a meaningful name.

2:04:54.411 --> 2:04:55.996
It stands for "grand mountain,"

2:04:57.289 --> 2:04:59.166
does it not?

2:05:01.502 --> 2:05:02.878
It does.

2:05:04.755 --> 2:05:07.049
This Gyeonnaeryang Strait facing Hansan

2:05:07.883 --> 2:05:09.927
will be our front line.

2:05:11.678 --> 2:05:15.057
May Hansan prove to be
a truly grand mountain

2:05:16.975 --> 2:05:19.394
guarding our land.

2:05:21.188 --> 2:05:22.689
Such is my hope.

2:05:41.416 --> 2:05:43.252
The turtle ships have arrived!

2:05:48.841 --> 2:05:53.846
HANSAN: RISING DRAGON
