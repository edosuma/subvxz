WEBVTT

00:10.647 --> 00:13.923
Starfleet didn't send us out here
to humiliate ourselves.

00:17.367 --> 00:20.598
How long were we in orbit, grovelling?
Six days?

00:20.727 --> 00:22.797
Five, sir,
and it wasn't exactly grovelling.

00:22.927 --> 00:25.157
Apologising, asking forgiveness...

00:25.327 --> 00:27.238
just because we ate lunch
in front of them...

00:27.367 --> 00:29.756
on our own ship months ago.
I call that grovelling.

00:29.887 --> 00:31.286
They were offended.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.602
The Kreetassans manufacture
plasma injectors.

00:33.727 --> 00:37.242
- We need one.
- So we spend six days grovelling.

00:37.367 --> 00:38.322
Five days.

00:38.447 --> 00:40.358
Then when they finally agree
to talk to us...

00:40.487 --> 00:42.478
we go down. And what do they do?

00:43.647 --> 00:47.481
They keep us waiting for 12 hours
and then send us packing.

00:47.967 --> 00:52.404
No explanation, no plasma injector.
Just leave, go back to your ship.

00:52.807 --> 00:54.798
We obviously offended them again.

00:54.927 --> 00:57.395
Maybe my hair's parted
on the wrong side.

00:57.887 --> 01:01.197
I'm exhausted,
and I've had it with these people.

01:02.607 --> 01:05.325
- Go ahead.
- The three of you are clear to go.

01:05.447 --> 01:08.439
But I'm afraid I'll need to keep Porthos
for a while.

01:08.567 --> 01:09.886
What's the problem?

01:10.007 --> 01:12.726
He picked up a pathogen of some kind
on the surface.

01:12.847 --> 01:14.599
Neither decon agent has been effective.

01:14.727 --> 01:16.797
- What are you going to do?
- I'm not sure yet.

01:16.927 --> 01:19.760
I'll let you know
as soon as I've run some tests.

01:22.767 --> 01:24.598
Feel better, Porthos.

01:24.727 --> 01:27.036
Doc will have you good as new
before you know it.

01:27.167 --> 01:29.681
I might even break
the no-cheese rule tonight.

01:34.727 --> 01:37.480
Sorry, fella. You got to stay.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.807 --> 01:53.367
It's been a long road

01:54.967 --> 01:57.925
Gettin' from there to here

01:58.167 --> 02:00.965
It's been a long time

02:01.767 --> 02:05.237
But my time is finally near

02:05.727 --> 02:09.116
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:09.967 --> 02:12.800
I will touch the sky

02:13.247 --> 02:16.842
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:16.967 --> 02:19.959
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:20.087 --> 02:24.365
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:24.567 --> 02:27.604
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:27.727 --> 02:31.879
I've got faith to believe

02:32.007 --> 02:34.965
I can do anything

02:35.087 --> 02:38.762
I've got strength of the soul

02:39.447 --> 02:42.439
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:42.567 --> 02:46.719
I can reach any star

02:47.887 --> 02:49.878
I've got faith

02:51.767 --> 02:54.918
I've got faith

02:55.407 --> 02:58.683
Faith of the heart

03:15.727 --> 03:17.524
We're playing with fire, Captain.

03:17.647 --> 03:20.684
It's just a matter of time
before this injector gives up the ghost.

03:20.807 --> 03:24.004
You've got four more.
The ship can run on four.

03:24.527 --> 03:26.245
Yeah, but it can't run on three.

03:26.767 --> 03:28.280
You know what happens
at warp speed...

03:28.407 --> 03:30.716
when you've only got
three plasma injectors online.

03:30.847 --> 03:34.317
What are the odds of us losing another
one before we find a replacement?

03:34.447 --> 03:37.917
I'm not comfortable with four, Captain.
We need five.

03:38.487 --> 03:41.524
What the hell happened
down there, anyway?

03:41.847 --> 03:45.362
- T'Pol thinks we insulted them again.
- How?

03:46.767 --> 03:50.396
- You didn't eat cabbage before you left.
- I was a perfect gentleman.

03:50.927 --> 03:53.680
We're going to have to go somewhere
else to find your injector, Trip.

03:53.807 --> 03:55.479
These people are impossible.

03:55.607 --> 03:58.883
Their components are
metallurgically sound, dependable.

03:59.007 --> 04:02.841
We could look for six months and
not find anything half as compatible.

04:03.767 --> 04:06.804
You're a trained diplomat.
Take the high road.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.725
There's got to be some way
you can kiss and make up.

04:13.087 --> 04:16.841
I'll have T'Pol see
if she can find out what we did.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.117
But I'm not promising anything.

04:22.247 --> 04:26.320
I went to Decon. I thought you were
down there with Porthos. Is every...

04:26.447 --> 04:29.837
It's all right to pet him.
You'll have to use the isolation gloves.

04:29.967 --> 04:31.639
Did you run your tests?

04:32.567 --> 04:34.956
His autoimmune system is collapsing.

04:35.087 --> 04:37.999
I've isolated the pathogen,
broken down its protein sequence.

04:38.127 --> 04:42.040
I can't explain it, Captain.
It shouldn't be affecting him like this.

04:42.167 --> 04:43.236
But it is.

04:45.847 --> 04:47.519
So what are you doing?

04:47.847 --> 04:50.566
Running more tests.
I'm sure I'll come up with something.

04:50.687 --> 04:51.961
How sure?

04:53.207 --> 04:55.960
Could this be life-threatening?

04:56.647 --> 04:58.239
It's too early to tell.

05:03.967 --> 05:07.323
Didn't we send his genome
to the Kreetassans along with ours?

05:07.447 --> 05:10.086
I transmitted them myself
before you left Enterprise.

05:10.247 --> 05:12.681
Shouldn't they have noticed
there's a pathogen there...

05:12.807 --> 05:14.365
that his immune system can't handle?

05:14.527 --> 05:17.564
They should have,
assuming they took the time to check.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.276
I'm told I've offended
these people twice.

05:24.367 --> 05:28.599
Once for eating in front of them.
The second time, I don't know what for.

05:29.207 --> 05:32.165
But if their carelessness
has hurt Porthos...

05:32.287 --> 05:34.676
or, God forbid, ends up killing him...

05:36.447 --> 05:39.166
they're going to find out
what being offended is all about.

05:39.287 --> 05:43.360
Porthos has no intention of giving up.
And neither do I.

05:53.247 --> 05:54.680
You hear that, boy?

06:00.807 --> 06:02.559
We're all pulling for you.

06:07.047 --> 06:08.639
- Did you reach them?
- Yes.

06:09.127 --> 06:10.196
And?

06:11.447 --> 06:14.325
I think we should discuss this
in your Ready Room.

06:20.967 --> 06:22.036
Well?

06:22.247 --> 06:25.284
Do you recall the stand of trees
outside the Hall of Diplomacy?

06:25.407 --> 06:26.476
What are you talking about?

06:26.607 --> 06:28.563
They're Alvera trees.
Over 300 years old.

06:28.687 --> 06:30.405
That's fascinating.

06:30.527 --> 06:32.995
Did you apologise
for whatever we did wrong?

06:33.127 --> 06:35.322
Are we going to get
our plasma injector?

06:35.447 --> 06:38.837
The Kreetassans consider
the Alvera trees cultural treasures.

06:39.167 --> 06:41.761
Apparently, Porthos urinated
on one of them.

06:41.887 --> 06:45.038
- And that's what they're insulted about?
- It is understandable.

06:45.167 --> 06:48.204
Maybe if they had bothered to read
the genetic profile we sent...

06:48.327 --> 06:50.477
they'd have told us
to leave the dog on the ship.

06:50.607 --> 06:52.438
Then he wouldn't have had
an opportunity...

06:52.567 --> 06:54.683
to pee on one of their precious trees.

06:54.847 --> 06:57.361
I conveyed your sincerest apologies
to the Chancellery.

06:57.487 --> 06:59.478
They're discussing
possible acts of contrition.

06:59.607 --> 07:02.599
Where the hell do you get off
conveying my sincerest apologies?

07:02.727 --> 07:04.319
They're the ones who should be sorry.

07:04.447 --> 07:07.519
I don't need to remind you that
Commander Tucker is relying on us.

07:07.647 --> 07:10.957
There are some things more important
than plasma injectors.

07:11.847 --> 07:14.156
Are you referring to your pride?

07:15.327 --> 07:17.795
I'll tell you one thing, Subcommander.

07:17.927 --> 07:20.441
If anything happens to Porthos...

07:20.567 --> 07:23.161
I'll be the one
watering their Alvera trees.

08:02.087 --> 08:03.361
If you were a married man...

08:03.487 --> 08:06.206
I'd be wondering
if your wife had thrown you out.

08:06.367 --> 08:09.996
I just thought it might cheer Porthos up
if I slept here tonight.

08:10.127 --> 08:11.799
That is, if it's all right with you.

08:11.927 --> 08:16.079
I don't think your dog is in any condition
to know whether you're here or not.

08:16.207 --> 08:18.277
Then maybe it'll cheer me up.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.437
Be my guest. Take your pick.

08:23.527 --> 08:24.926
How's Porthos doing?

08:25.087 --> 08:28.318
My sub-mammalian database
contains no pertinent files on Bugles...

08:28.447 --> 08:31.439
but there's sufficient information
on similar chordata.

08:32.327 --> 08:35.159
- Beagles.
- Yes.

08:35.967 --> 08:39.198
Let me ask you a question, Doc,
just out of curiosity.

08:40.246 --> 08:42.807
Are there any dogs
on your home world?

08:44.567 --> 08:47.240
The Denobulan Lemur
is highly sought after.

08:47.367 --> 08:50.200
It's not exactly a dog,
but you could say it's doglike.

08:50.327 --> 08:53.239
It has a tail, fur. Most have one head.

08:54.607 --> 08:59.044
- Did your medical training include any...
- Captain, please.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.316
You needn't be concerned.

09:00.447 --> 09:03.598
I hold six degrees
in interspecies veterinary medicine.

09:03.727 --> 09:07.083
I thought you were just, you know,
a people doctor.

09:07.207 --> 09:09.562
As a matter of fact,
I've also earned degrees...

09:09.687 --> 09:12.247
in dentistry, haematology,
botanical pharmacology...

09:12.367 --> 09:13.800
I'm impressed.

09:16.327 --> 09:17.919
So, how's he doing?

09:19.687 --> 09:21.723
I believe I've eliminated the pathogen.

09:21.847 --> 09:23.838
The question is whether my treatment...

09:23.967 --> 09:28.438
will stabilise
his autoimmune system before...

09:29.847 --> 09:31.041
Before what?

09:32.047 --> 09:34.402
In a few hours,
I'll have a more detailed prognosis.

09:34.527 --> 09:36.040
Before what, Doctor?

09:39.367 --> 09:42.598
There are many harmless strains
of bacteria that can become lethal...

09:42.727 --> 09:44.558
when the immune system
is compromised.

09:44.687 --> 09:47.565
But it is too early
to be thinking about that.

09:49.527 --> 09:51.961
Now we should both try to get
a few hours of rest.

09:52.087 --> 09:54.043
If there are any changes
in his vital signs...

09:54.167 --> 09:55.885
the alarms are quite loud.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.282
Good night.

10:06.167 --> 10:08.920
I would have brought you
some cheese...

10:09.327 --> 10:11.761
but Dr. Phlox wouldn't have let me
give you any.

11:13.287 --> 11:15.323
Doctor, are you all right?

11:16.287 --> 11:18.642
I'm sorry, Captain. Did I wake you?

11:19.047 --> 11:22.005
Just trimming my toenails.
They grow quite rapidly.

11:22.167 --> 11:25.204
Have to keep them groomed
at least once a week.

11:25.407 --> 11:29.719
- Just wanted to be sure you're okay.
- Thanks for your concern. Good night.

12:17.887 --> 12:20.196
I'm sorry, Captain.
Did I wake you again?

12:20.327 --> 12:23.160
- What the hell's going on?
- Feeding time.

12:25.167 --> 12:26.566
Don't be greedy.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.605
How long was I asleep?

12:29.807 --> 12:31.286
Nearly an hour.

12:32.167 --> 12:35.239
- Does this go on every night?
- Only when I'm here.

12:35.727 --> 12:38.685
They're very demanding
when they know I'm in Sickbay.

12:39.287 --> 12:40.436
Great.

12:42.247 --> 12:43.441
Porthos?

12:43.567 --> 12:45.956
I'll still need at least a couple of hours.

12:46.087 --> 12:48.555
- Is he comfortable?
- He's fast asleep.

12:49.927 --> 12:51.918
I'm glad to see someone is.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.161
I'll check back in a couple of hours.

13:39.807 --> 13:41.286
How's your dog?

13:41.407 --> 13:45.036
Nice of you to ask.
We'll know in a couple of hours.

13:58.287 --> 14:00.755
Have you heard from your friends
on the surface?

14:00.887 --> 14:01.842
Not yet.

14:02.287 --> 14:05.359
I guess they haven't finished
compiling their list of punishments.

14:06.287 --> 14:08.721
They're not interested in punishing you.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.042
They only want an appropriate apology.

14:12.567 --> 14:14.922
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

14:15.207 --> 14:16.799
Just practising.

14:26.127 --> 14:28.925
You shouldn't have brought your dog
on a diplomatic mission...

14:29.047 --> 14:32.039
especially considering we had
previously offended the Kreetassans.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.885
They knew we were bringing him.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.805
We even sent his genetic specs.

14:38.247 --> 14:40.886
They could have asked us
to leave him behind.

14:41.007 --> 14:42.122
They didn't.

14:42.247 --> 14:45.557
Porthos has the right to a little fresh air.

14:46.247 --> 14:49.717
You're once again ignoring
the consequences of your actions.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.041
What's that supposed to mean?

14:51.167 --> 14:52.759
You obviously place more importance...

14:52.887 --> 14:54.957
on the quality of the air
your pet breathes...

14:55.087 --> 14:58.124
than on the quality of the plasma
that drives your ship.

14:58.247 --> 15:00.636
What the hell does one have to do
with the other?

15:00.767 --> 15:04.840
Isn't it logical I care about my ship...

15:04.967 --> 15:06.195
and my dog?

15:06.327 --> 15:08.602
I'm not questioning your pluralities.

15:08.727 --> 15:10.877
I'm questioning your priorities.

15:13.607 --> 15:17.077
I really thought you were beginning
to understand something...

15:17.207 --> 15:18.799
about human feelings.

15:18.927 --> 15:20.997
Not when it pertains
to primitive quadrupeds...

15:21.127 --> 15:24.836
who haven't developed
the ability to speak or to use a toilet.

15:26.767 --> 15:28.405
What's the matter?

15:29.567 --> 15:31.842
I obviously can't keep up with you.

15:34.807 --> 15:35.762
T'Pol.

15:35.887 --> 15:38.401
We've just received a transmission
from the Kreetassans.

15:38.527 --> 15:42.042
It's their reconciliation demands.
The Captain's not going to believe this.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.805
You'd be surprised, Hoshi.

15:44.127 --> 15:46.322
- Captain, I didn't...
- It's all right, Ensign.

15:46.447 --> 15:48.005
We're on our way.

16:08.087 --> 16:09.600
This isn't so bad.

16:10.527 --> 16:13.564
I was sure there'd be something here
about standing on one foot...

16:13.687 --> 16:16.838
with my eyes shut,
reciting The Night Before Christmas.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.685
I'm going back to Sickbay
to see if I can get an hour's sleep...

16:20.807 --> 16:23.196
before the Doctor's results
come through.

16:23.447 --> 16:27.235
Tell me if this fits with your definition
of an appropriate apology.

16:34.087 --> 16:36.203
Do we have a chain saw on board?

16:47.527 --> 16:48.801
What's happening?

16:49.887 --> 16:52.355
He's going into anaphylactic shock.

16:53.047 --> 16:55.766
His body's rejecting
the treatment I selected.

16:55.887 --> 16:58.355
You said we'd know in a few hours
if this would work.

16:58.487 --> 17:01.206
Exactly. It's not working.

17:03.127 --> 17:04.355
Is he going to die?

17:04.487 --> 17:06.637
Fill this with 5 cc of tetrasol.

17:06.767 --> 17:10.123
It's the blue fluid,
second on the right, 5 cc.

17:16.007 --> 17:17.234
5 cc.

17:31.527 --> 17:34.041
- I don't think so.
- What?

17:35.087 --> 17:36.600
You asked me if he was going to die.

17:42.087 --> 17:44.442
Are you trying a different treatment?

17:46.087 --> 17:49.523
- Let me guess. We'll know in...
- A couple of hours, yes.

17:53.327 --> 17:56.080
How are things progressing
with the Kreetassans?

17:56.207 --> 18:00.644
They've got a perfectly good plasma
injector sitting on a shelf somewhere.

18:01.207 --> 18:03.402
But will they share with us?

18:05.327 --> 18:08.285
Not until I make a fool of myself
by going through...

18:08.527 --> 18:11.917
some series of ritual apologies.

18:12.367 --> 18:14.835
The fact that Porthos
is on death's doorstep...

18:14.967 --> 18:16.480
doesn't seem to bother any of them.

18:16.607 --> 18:19.519
They're the ones
who should be apologising, not me.

18:20.487 --> 18:25.277
T'Pol thinks I care more about my dog
than my ship. Isn't that delightful?

18:26.727 --> 18:28.558
Why does T'Pol's opinion concern you?

18:28.687 --> 18:31.042
She's my science officer,
my second-in-command.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.998
She should know,
more than anyone aboard...

18:33.127 --> 18:36.722
how dedicated I am to this mission.
To every member of my crew.

18:37.007 --> 18:38.998
You didn't answer my question.

18:39.127 --> 18:40.799
Porthos has one paw
in Beagle heaven...

18:40.927 --> 18:43.919
because these jerks didn't bother
to look at his genetic profile.

18:44.047 --> 18:45.480
Am I supposed to ignore that?

18:45.607 --> 18:48.519
I would think you'd be more interested
in Commander Tucker's opinion.

18:48.647 --> 18:50.444
You've known him for many years.

18:50.567 --> 18:54.116
It'd be nice to have
all five plasma injectors working...

18:54.247 --> 18:56.158
but it's not essential.

18:56.287 --> 18:59.962
We can do fine with four,
and the fifth one just started to act up.

19:01.047 --> 19:03.959
We might get another 10 light-years
out of it.

19:04.087 --> 19:05.315
Have you considered that...

19:05.447 --> 19:08.007
you may be angry at more than Porthos
and the Kreetassans?

19:08.127 --> 19:09.196
What?

19:09.327 --> 19:11.887
How long has it been
since you were intimate with a woman?

19:12.007 --> 19:12.996
What?

19:13.127 --> 19:14.640
- How long has it been...
- I heard you!

19:15.767 --> 19:19.123
I suppose you're going to tell me
you have a degree in psychiatry, too.

19:19.247 --> 19:20.475
Absolutely.

19:22.887 --> 19:24.923
No way. Not a chance.

19:25.047 --> 19:28.676
Porthos is the only patient
you're treating right now. You got that?

19:28.807 --> 19:31.196
Let me know if there's any change.

19:51.127 --> 19:54.278
Why haven't you adjusted your time
to our capital city?

19:54.407 --> 19:57.001
I apologise.
We weren't aware that it was required.

19:57.127 --> 20:00.563
It isn't a requirement.
It is simply a courtesy.

20:00.687 --> 20:04.077
Something your species
doesn't seem to understand.

20:04.207 --> 20:06.402
I'll explain it to the Captain immediately.

20:06.527 --> 20:09.519
You might also explain to your captain...

20:09.647 --> 20:13.117
that it's been nearly three hours
since he received our transmission.

20:13.247 --> 20:17.684
If he has the slightest hope
of acquiring any technology from us...

20:17.807 --> 20:20.719
he'd be wise to pay us
the courtesy of responding.

20:20.847 --> 20:22.485
I understand. I'll...

20:22.927 --> 20:24.519
I'll let him know.

20:35.687 --> 20:37.120
Keep your head down!

20:38.687 --> 20:42.760
No matter what I do to secure her cage,
she always finds a way to get out.

21:55.967 --> 21:58.765
I thought you said
your bat was terrified of that thing.

21:58.887 --> 22:02.402
It should have been.
Pyrithian Moon Hawks eat these bats.

22:05.287 --> 22:07.118
I know I got the silhouette right.

22:07.247 --> 22:10.478
I mastered the call years ago.

22:14.407 --> 22:16.477
That stuff isn't poisonous, is it?

22:18.807 --> 22:20.365
No, I'll be fine.

22:21.367 --> 22:22.516
What now?

22:24.527 --> 22:28.361
We need to find her before
we can catch her. She'll stay up high.

22:46.527 --> 22:50.964
Have you thought any more about why
T'Pol's opinion is so important to you?

22:51.287 --> 22:54.962
It's 2:30 in the morning,
and I'm hunting an escaped bat.

22:55.087 --> 22:59.080
That's all I'm thinking about right now,
Doctor. That and Porthos.

22:59.527 --> 23:02.803
Sexual tension, Captain.
There's no doubt in my mind.

23:04.647 --> 23:06.956
By the air duct. Do you see it?

23:07.647 --> 23:09.922
That's just the filter bracket.

23:10.047 --> 23:12.845
For the past few months,
I've noticed increasing friction...

23:12.967 --> 23:14.685
between you and the Subcommander.

23:14.807 --> 23:17.446
You must understand
I'm trained to observe these things.

23:17.567 --> 23:21.321
With all due respect to your training,
you're wrong.

23:21.927 --> 23:25.681
T'Pol and I have been getting along
just fine, so let it alone.

23:25.927 --> 23:29.237
When a person thinks sexual attraction
toward another is inappropriate...

23:29.367 --> 23:32.200
they often exhibit unexpected behaviour.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.160
Such as inordinate anger
toward comparisons made...

23:35.287 --> 23:37.801
between their ship and their Beagle.

23:39.727 --> 23:40.921
Listen, Doc.

23:42.527 --> 23:45.758
- There's no sexual attraction.
- She's coming back down!

23:48.247 --> 23:50.602
- Look out!
- Don't let her in the corridor!

23:50.767 --> 23:54.282
Hey, are you all right?
What are they trying to do to you?

23:56.767 --> 23:57.802
Bat.

23:58.887 --> 24:01.037
The Kreetassans called, sir.

24:02.207 --> 24:03.322
What for?

24:03.447 --> 24:06.439
They're anxious to get your response
to their last transmission.

24:06.567 --> 24:08.478
It's the middle of the night.

24:08.967 --> 24:10.400
They also suggested that...

24:10.527 --> 24:13.724
we should synchronise our time
to their capital city.

24:13.847 --> 24:14.996
Did they?

24:15.407 --> 24:18.365
It's not a requirement, sir,
just a courtesy.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.925
Thank you, Ensign.

24:22.447 --> 24:23.926
How's Porthos?

24:25.087 --> 24:27.999
I'll let you know in a couple of hours.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.321
- Everything okay?
- Nothing new.

24:35.527 --> 24:37.279
I'll stay with him.

24:39.047 --> 24:40.241
Thanks.

24:40.567 --> 24:42.797
Unless you'd like to continue
our discussion...

24:42.927 --> 24:44.724
regarding Subcommander T'Pol.

24:46.767 --> 24:49.235
We are gathered here today...

24:49.527 --> 24:51.757
to bid a final farewell...

24:52.247 --> 24:54.715
to a faithful and kind colleague.

24:55.447 --> 24:59.884
A friend who would never hesitate
to offer his paw...

25:00.167 --> 25:02.681
in exchange for a simple smile...

25:03.487 --> 25:05.284
or a slice of cheese.

25:05.887 --> 25:10.438
Like his namesake, this quadruped
believed we should stand together.

25:10.847 --> 25:14.601
"All for one and one for all."

25:16.127 --> 25:21.042
When a person thinks sexual attraction
toward another is inappropriate...

25:22.287 --> 25:25.802
they often exhibit unexpected behaviour.

25:47.287 --> 25:48.436
Go ahead.

25:48.567 --> 25:50.319
Hoshi, you and the dog are clear to go...

25:50.447 --> 25:53.086
but I'm afraid I'll need to keep
the other two for a while.

25:53.207 --> 25:54.242
What's the problem?

25:54.367 --> 25:56.278
You both picked up a pathogen
on the surface.

25:56.407 --> 25:58.637
We'll have to try another decon agent.

26:07.007 --> 26:08.201
Feel better.

26:37.487 --> 26:39.842
Tell me, Captain,
have you thought any more...

26:39.967 --> 26:42.879
about why T'Pol's opinion
is so important to you?

26:48.007 --> 26:51.158
How long has it been
since you were intimate with a woman?

27:02.487 --> 27:03.840
I dreamt...

27:05.487 --> 27:06.840
Porthos died.

27:08.087 --> 27:10.521
Let's hope your dream wasn't prophetic.

27:14.607 --> 27:17.838
Any indication
on how your second treatment's doing?

27:18.927 --> 27:21.600
It doesn't appear to be doing very well.

27:32.567 --> 27:37.163
An old girlfriend's mother
had this Beagle I was crazy about.

27:37.367 --> 27:41.042
Even after her daughter and I broke up,
we stayed in touch.

27:41.527 --> 27:45.156
When the dog got pregnant,
I was the first one she called.

27:46.167 --> 27:49.876
Four males in the litter.
The four musketeers.

27:51.967 --> 27:54.720
I've had Porthos
since he was six weeks old.

27:57.127 --> 27:58.924
I grew up with dogs.

28:00.607 --> 28:02.802
I can't remember not having one.

28:08.127 --> 28:10.595
Did you have any pets
when you were a kid?

28:10.727 --> 28:13.116
My people don't keep pets.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.717
I thought you said something about...

28:16.887 --> 28:21.039
the Denobulan Lemur
being highly sought after.

28:21.407 --> 28:24.160
Very much so. Their kidneys
are considered a great delicacy.

28:31.447 --> 28:34.519
- I thought you might be hungry.
- How very kind.

28:34.687 --> 28:38.965
Was there something on their list
about apologising on a full stomach?

28:39.687 --> 28:42.121
You read the Kreetassans' document?

28:43.687 --> 28:44.642
Sorry.

28:46.007 --> 28:48.316
Sorry, I'm a little on edge.

28:48.447 --> 28:51.917
I haven't slept very much,
but I'm doing the breast I...

28:52.447 --> 28:54.199
The best I can.

28:57.247 --> 28:58.680
I understand.

28:58.807 --> 29:01.765
Ensign Sato and I have broken down
the reconciliation demands...

29:01.887 --> 29:04.924
into specific categories.
If you're interested in reviewing them...

29:05.047 --> 29:06.765
My only concern right now is Porthos.

29:07.567 --> 29:10.604
- I'm sorry to have interrupted.
- No.

29:12.287 --> 29:14.562
No, it's okay.

29:15.287 --> 29:19.075
When you get back to the Bridge,
why don't you send me your lips?

29:19.207 --> 29:21.198
Lisp. List.

29:29.807 --> 29:33.595
Two Pillarian Slips
within 30 seconds. Interesting.

29:40.087 --> 29:41.281
What're you doing?

29:41.407 --> 29:43.682
My treatment was effective,
at least partially.

29:43.807 --> 29:45.718
His immune system is stabilising...

29:45.847 --> 29:49.522
but his pituitary gland was severely
damaged. It's all but disintegrated.

29:49.647 --> 29:53.435
Bring me the small grey cage
on the second shelf, with the blue top.

29:58.127 --> 30:00.960
- What's in here?
- A Calrissian Chameleon.

30:01.087 --> 30:04.159
Fill this for me.
I'll need to alter its DNA...

30:04.287 --> 30:07.085
but its pituitary gland
should be compatible with your dog's.

30:07.207 --> 30:09.277
You're performing a transplant
from a lizard?

30:09.407 --> 30:10.840
Unless you have a better suggestion.

30:10.967 --> 30:13.845
It's a shame, actually.
The chameleon secretes a rare toxin...

30:13.967 --> 30:17.676
that's useful in treating respiratory
infections. She's the last one I have.

30:19.447 --> 30:20.721
What's the tank for?

30:20.887 --> 30:23.242
I'll need to super-hydrate the canine...

30:23.407 --> 30:26.604
in order to minimise the shock
to his pulmonary system.

30:26.727 --> 30:28.206
You're gonna drown my dog?

30:28.327 --> 30:30.079
Only for an hour, Captain.

30:30.207 --> 30:32.437
There should be no problem
resuscitating him...

30:32.567 --> 30:34.080
once the surgery is complete.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.925
How many times
have you done this before?

30:37.367 --> 30:38.516
Never.

30:40.367 --> 30:42.244
Has anyone done this before?

30:42.367 --> 30:43.959
Not to my knowledge.

30:44.167 --> 30:46.522
This isn't some guinea pig
you're working on here.

30:46.647 --> 30:48.842
This is Porthos, my Beagle, my pal.

30:48.967 --> 30:52.562
From what you're telling me, the closest
thing your people have to pets...

30:52.687 --> 30:55.360
are furry little things
that go well with onions.

30:56.207 --> 30:58.163
Perhaps you're right, Captain.

30:58.527 --> 31:01.485
Perhaps I'm insensitive
to the bond between you...

31:01.607 --> 31:03.677
and your subservient quadruped.

31:04.807 --> 31:07.002
I'll leave the procedure up to you.

31:07.527 --> 31:10.360
But whatever your decision,
make it quickly.

31:24.367 --> 31:27.404
Just for the sake of argument,
let's say...

31:27.527 --> 31:31.805
that some of my anger toward T'Pol
had a component of sexual tension to it.

31:31.927 --> 31:34.839
I'm not saying it does,
but just for the sake of argument.

31:34.967 --> 31:36.002
Yes.

31:36.247 --> 31:37.202
What do you mean, yes?

31:38.407 --> 31:39.476
You're the psychiatrist.

31:40.007 --> 31:43.477
What am I supposed to do about it?
Am I supposed to ignore it?

31:43.607 --> 31:45.438
Am I supposed to say something to her?

31:45.567 --> 31:47.239
- Neither.
- Neither?

31:47.807 --> 31:51.083
If you were ignoring it, you obviously
wouldn't be seeking my opinion...

31:51.207 --> 31:53.038
especially under these circumstances.

31:53.167 --> 31:55.556
As for discussing it
with the Subcommander...

31:55.687 --> 31:58.485
that's entirely up to you,
but I can't imagine an outcome...

31:58.607 --> 32:01.360
that would do anything
but make matters worse.

32:01.927 --> 32:04.964
Pass me the auto-suture, please.
The yellow one.

32:08.687 --> 32:10.757
When will we know
if the transplant's working?

32:10.887 --> 32:14.197
One step at a time.
First we need to resuscitate him.

32:15.087 --> 32:17.999
So I can't ignore it,
and I can't talk about it.

32:18.127 --> 32:19.845
What do you suggest I do?

32:19.967 --> 32:23.164
Be aware of it, Captain.
Simply be aware of it.

32:23.287 --> 32:25.517
You'd be surprised
what a difference that'll make.

32:25.647 --> 32:29.799
Lower the fluidic temperature
12 degrees.

32:33.247 --> 32:37.286
If Porthos pulls through, will he need
a special diet or treatments...

32:37.407 --> 32:39.523
having a chameleon's pituitary gland?

32:39.647 --> 32:41.558
You may have trouble finding him.

32:41.687 --> 32:44.804
He'll have the ability to blend
into his background when frightened.

32:46.127 --> 32:48.516
- You're kidding.
- Yes, I am.

32:55.887 --> 32:59.402
Does your expertise on sexual tension...

32:59.527 --> 33:03.998
come from professional training
or first-hand experience?

33:04.407 --> 33:06.204
I do have three wives.

33:06.647 --> 33:10.560
- And they each have...
- Two husbands, besides myself.

33:11.047 --> 33:14.596
- Sounds very complicated.
- Very. Why else be polygamous?

33:15.247 --> 33:18.956
- So these three wives...
- Each have three husbands.

33:19.087 --> 33:23.956
A total of 720 relationships,
42 of which have romantic possibilities.

33:24.367 --> 33:26.801
You told me you had five children.

33:27.127 --> 33:30.039
How many are there
in this whole extended family?

33:30.247 --> 33:32.203
Thirty-one, at last count.

33:34.167 --> 33:38.285
You must miss them.
You've been away for over two years.

33:38.407 --> 33:42.036
I'm ready for the synaptic inductor,
the small blue one.

33:44.367 --> 33:47.404
My children all left the nest
years ago, Captain.

33:48.527 --> 33:52.122
I would have never guessed.
You don't look that old.

33:54.047 --> 33:55.321
I'll take that as a compliment.

33:57.407 --> 34:00.285
My two daughters, I'm proud to say,
followed in my footsteps.

34:00.407 --> 34:03.160
One is a surgeon.
The other is a biochemist.

34:03.287 --> 34:04.766
How about the other three?

34:04.887 --> 34:07.959
My eldest son's an artist.
A potter, actually.

34:08.127 --> 34:11.199
He lives in the same town
as his mother, creates beautiful things.

34:11.327 --> 34:13.045
And the other two?

34:14.967 --> 34:17.639
My two younger sons and I
never saw eye-to-eye.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.163
I'm afraid we haven't spoken
in quite some time.

34:24.246 --> 34:27.364
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
- It's perfectly all right.

34:28.447 --> 34:32.440
You asked me if I missed them.
The answer is yes, every one of them.

34:32.967 --> 34:36.322
The children, the wives,
even the other husbands.

34:37.047 --> 34:40.039
But we Denobulans
live a long time, Captain...

34:40.167 --> 34:42.726
and right now
there's nowhere I'd rather be...

34:42.847 --> 34:45.964
than serving with
the Interspecies Medical Exchange...

34:46.087 --> 34:47.725
aboard this wonderful vessel of yours.

34:51.766 --> 34:55.123
Listen, Doc, however this turns out...

34:55.286 --> 35:00.202
I want to apologise for accusing you
of being insensitive before.

35:01.127 --> 35:05.040
As I recall, you accused
my entire species of being insensitive.

35:05.607 --> 35:10.522
Then I apologise to you,
and all your fellow Denobulans.

35:11.887 --> 35:16.756
I can't speak for the others,
but, on behalf of myself, I accept.

35:19.047 --> 35:22.437
And to think T'Pol told me
you were incapable of apologising.

36:56.887 --> 36:58.036
Come in.

37:01.127 --> 37:02.526
Subcommander.

37:03.007 --> 37:04.520
Mr Tucker reports that...

37:04.647 --> 37:08.560
the new plasma injector is operating
well within Starfleet parameters.

37:09.127 --> 37:13.518
Did he tell you they gave us two spares
out of the kindness of their hearts?

37:13.847 --> 37:15.883
Evidently the finesse you exhibited...

37:16.007 --> 37:18.999
outside the Hall of Diplomacy
was appreciated.

37:19.127 --> 37:22.915
Since I've been getting
so much practice giving apologies...

37:25.287 --> 37:27.118
I thought I might give you one.

37:27.247 --> 37:30.205
- That's not necessary.
- Yeah, it is.

37:32.247 --> 37:36.286
I've been under a lot of stress lately.
Haven't gotten much sleep.

37:37.567 --> 37:39.842
- My dog...
- There's no need to apologise.

37:41.647 --> 37:45.435
Whatever friction there's been
between us...

37:45.967 --> 37:47.844
I'd like to try to minimise it.

37:48.167 --> 37:51.955
Friction is to be expected whenever
people work in close quarters...

37:52.087 --> 37:54.043
for extended periods of time.

37:55.687 --> 37:57.917
I guess that's always been true.

37:58.647 --> 38:03.482
Especially when the people
are of the opposite sex.

38:04.567 --> 38:07.240
Then it's good that
you're my superior officer.

38:07.367 --> 38:10.837
That we're not in a position
to allow ourselves...

38:10.967 --> 38:14.243
to become attracted
to one another, hypothetically.

38:14.687 --> 38:16.086
If we were...

38:16.607 --> 38:21.397
the friction that you speak of
could be much more problematic.

38:44.887 --> 38:47.162
No apologies, Captain.

38:47.287 --> 38:48.606
I promise.

38:49.167 --> 38:52.443
I hear things went very well
on the surface.

38:53.767 --> 38:58.079
I doubt I would have even gone down
there, if it hadn't been for you, Doc.

39:00.327 --> 39:01.840
I owe you one.

39:03.767 --> 39:07.157
You'll be happy to know, while you
were gone, things went well here, too.

39:07.287 --> 39:10.597
- The transplant?
- Not the slightest sign of rejection.

39:10.727 --> 39:12.843
- Can I see him?
- By all means.

39:24.167 --> 39:26.965
It's been one hell of a night, hasn't it?

39:28.647 --> 39:30.319
How soon can he leave?

39:30.487 --> 39:32.557
Now is as good a time as any.

39:32.687 --> 39:35.247
- But he's...
- Unconscious? Nonsense.

39:35.367 --> 39:36.800
He's just asleep.

39:42.847 --> 39:44.644
Come on, boy.

39:48.367 --> 39:49.925
We're going home.

39:59.887 --> 40:01.445
Sickbay's all yours.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.127
You're welcome back anytime, Captain.
