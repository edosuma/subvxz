17:50.074 --> 17:51.408
At this point,
I feel like I can't

17:51.442 --> 17:53.827
take a song away
from someone else.

17:53.861 --> 17:57.664
Do you just not wanna sing
at all?

17:57.698 --> 18:00.700
Tom, check your phone.

18:02.670 --> 18:03.787
Oh, my God.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.589
8 missed calls and 22 emails
in half an hour?

18:06.624 --> 18:07.841
Someone leaked
to the press

18:07.875 --> 18:09.492
that you and Julia
are splitting up.

18:09.510 --> 18:10.627
It's everywhere...

18:10.661 --> 18:12.379
The boards, the blogs.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.330
Who would've leaked it?

18:14.348 --> 18:16.332
I've just got one guess:

18:16.350 --> 18:18.501
Somebody
I used to be married to.

18:18.519 --> 18:19.602
We're in trouble.

18:19.637 --> 18:20.854
People already think
<i>Bombshell</i>

18:20.888 --> 18:22.055
has a split personality.

18:22.106 --> 18:24.674
An actual split
proves it's true.

18:24.692 --> 18:26.893
And it doesn't help
that half the partnership

18:26.944 --> 18:28.111
is never here, Tom.

18:28.145 --> 18:31.197
I'm calling her.

18:32.900 --> 18:37.037
MTW was a bust.

18:37.071 --> 18:41.891
So do you think
he brought it back...

18:48.382 --> 18:51.701
You haven't been here?

18:51.719 --> 18:55.204
Where have you
been staying?

18:55.222 --> 18:58.224
Around.

19:02.513 --> 19:04.714

Aha.

19:18.446 --> 19:20.163
Here it is.

19:20.197 --> 19:21.865
What, that's what
you've been looking for?

19:21.899 --> 19:24.751
Um, no.

19:24.785 --> 19:27.954
These.

19:28.005 --> 19:30.590
A lot of these ideas
weren't right.

19:30.624 --> 19:31.791
Some were fascinating,
so I thought

19:31.842 --> 19:34.961
there might
be something here.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.916
Huh.

19:39.934 --> 19:41.434
"Newsreel"?
What's that mean?

19:41.469 --> 19:43.586
If I remember correctly,

19:43.604 --> 19:46.606
he had an idea
for an updated take

19:46.640 --> 19:49.092
on newsreel footage,

19:49.110 --> 19:50.643
blown out
across the proscenium,

19:50.694 --> 19:52.028
just in your face...

19:52.063 --> 19:55.198

tabloids, Twitter,

19:55.232 --> 19:57.117
YouTube,
a multimedia assault.

19:57.151 --> 19:59.319
Yeah, commenting on fame
was, like, Kyle's big thing.

19:59.370 --> 20:00.370
Mm hmm.

20:00.371 --> 20:01.654
At the Fringe,
he had this idea

20:01.705 --> 20:03.706
where we take the
ticket holders' phone numbers

20:03.741 --> 20:05.608
and send them texts
during the show.

20:05.643 --> 20:08.444
I mean, we couldn't
pull it off, but...

20:08.462 --> 20:12.499

during the show?

20:12.550 --> 20:14.951
Wow.
I like it.

20:14.969 --> 20:17.286
Well, it doesn't matter.
I mean, it's impossible.

20:17.304 --> 20:19.856
Well, nothing's impossible
if you have enough money.

20:19.890 --> 20:23.309
Does Jerry Rand
have that kind of money?

20:23.344 --> 20:24.794
Are you kidding?

20:24.812 --> 20:26.980
- It's a great idea!
- Yeah.

20:30.067 --> 20:32.301
Can we really get that done
by tonight?

20:32.319 --> 20:34.821
We could try.

20:36.023 --> 20:37.640
Hey.
What's going on?

20:37.658 --> 20:39.642
So I had my agent
do some research,

20:39.660 --> 20:41.111
and it turns out
that Daisy Parker

20:41.145 --> 20:42.979
was one of the six dancers
who accused Derek

20:43.013 --> 20:44.531
of sexual harassment
last fall,

20:44.582 --> 20:47.417
you know, the ones who
mysteriously dropped the suit.

20:47.451 --> 20:49.152
So what are you saying?

about Jonathan Groff...

21:15.673 --> 21:17.174
Hi. How are you?
Hey, listen.

21:17.208 --> 21:18.475
I'm sorry I haven't gotten
a chance to see <i>Bombshell,</i>

21:18.509 --> 21:20.043
but I hear the tourists
love it.

I didn't get the chance.

that sweet, gratuitous nudity

So, uh, where's Julia?

21:29.604 --> 21:31.688
- Or are the rumors true?
- Oh, she's here.

21:31.722 --> 21:34.241
She's singing tonight,
so she's probably by the bar.

21:42.867 --> 21:46.253
This is getting ridiculous.
Where is Julia?

21:46.287 --> 21:48.171
I told Laura Benanti
she's in the bathroom.

21:48.206 --> 21:49.539
I told Norbert
she's in a taxi.

21:49.573 --> 21:51.425
I told Alice Ripley
she's backstage.

21:51.459 --> 21:53.927
Why... why can't I tell everyone
the same lie?

21:53.962 --> 21:55.323
I have a room
full of Tony voters

21:55.346 --> 21:57.130

they're at a funeral.

are almost done.

one of Kyle's ideas

22:13.948 --> 22:15.265
into the show
by curtain,

22:15.283 --> 22:16.483
and we have
to do it tonight.

22:16.534 --> 22:17.701
I appreciate
what you're doing for Kyle.

22:17.735 --> 22:19.286
I really do,
but we have a show too,

22:19.320 --> 22:20.704
and that one's
got your name on it.

- I'm leaving right now.
- Hurry.

22:22.707 --> 22:23.707
We're first up.
I had to change the order

22:23.741 --> 22:25.208
when I turned it
into a revue.

of last year...

for both of us,

22:31.215 --> 22:33.000
Okay, to be fair, Tom,
we broke up.

22:33.051 --> 22:34.751
Yes. And now that
everyone here knows it,

22:34.785 --> 22:36.953
it's gonna make being alone here
even more fun.

22:36.971 --> 22:38.705
- Wait. Everyone knows?
- You would know that too

22:38.740 --> 22:40.974
if you would
check your phone!

Then we don't have
to sing.

just say that?

Why is this
such a big deal to you?

with my best friend

and partner of 11 years,

one song that shows
that even if

22:54.989 --> 22:57.190
we never work together again,
that time meant something.

22:57.241 --> 22:58.325
- Tom...
- I'll see you

22:58.359 --> 23:00.310
when you get here.

are for.

are you adding?

27:38.806 --> 27:40.167
Why did you
put Daisy on tonight?

27:40.191 --> 27:41.591
Okay, we got a show
in ten minutes.

27:41.609 --> 27:43.026
I don't really
have time for this.

27:43.060 --> 27:45.729
She's one of the dancers
who came forward last fall.

27:45.763 --> 27:48.231
You said that went away.
Did it?

27:48.265 --> 27:50.066
I'm not having
this conversation with you,

27:50.100 --> 27:51.284
either of you.

27:51.319 --> 27:53.403
- Derek, stop.
- Nope.

27:53.437 --> 27:54.955
Well, okay,
I'm not going on stage

27:54.989 --> 27:56.439
till you tell me
what happened.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.458
Okay, fine. Maybe I'll put
your understudy on as well.

27:58.492 --> 28:00.777
- What is the matter with you?
- Nothing! Okay?

28:00.795 --> 28:03.613
It's obvi...
Can...

28:03.631 --> 28:08.335
It's obviously not nothing,
so what is it?

28:08.386 --> 28:10.170
You can tell me.

28:10.221 --> 28:13.273
Does she have something
on you?

28:13.307 --> 28:15.308
From last fall?

28:15.343 --> 28:17.894
Last month.

28:17.928 --> 28:19.529
[Sighs]
Derek...

28:19.563 --> 28:21.481
She came
to the <i>Bombshell</i> opening.

28:21.515 --> 28:24.301
She apologized to me.
We had a drink.

28:24.335 --> 28:25.352
Really?

28:25.386 --> 28:27.771
After everything
that happened?

28:27.805 --> 28:29.856
Yeah, well, I was upset
that night, okay?

28:29.907 --> 28:31.741

28:31.776 --> 28:33.109
Look, we saw each other
a few more times.

28:33.143 --> 28:34.744
She came to <i>Hit List.</i>
She loved it.

28:34.779 --> 28:36.863
She wanted to be in it.
And I wanted...

28:36.914 --> 28:38.198
You know.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.867
Go on.

28:40.918 --> 28:43.453
I told her
if we went to Broadway,

28:43.487 --> 28:45.321
she could be an understudy,
if she really wanted it,

28:45.339 --> 28:47.424
and she showed me
that she did.

28:47.458 --> 28:50.210
- You're unbelievable.
- Yes, I am.

28:50.261 --> 28:52.178
And you know
what the good news is?

28:52.213 --> 28:56.433
She filmed it, all of it,
including my offer.

28:56.467 --> 28:59.436
And if that gets out,
I'm done.

28:59.470 --> 29:00.854
So you gave her
Ana's role?

29:00.888 --> 29:02.455
Would you rather
I gave her yours?

29:02.490 --> 29:04.340
[Sighs]

29:04.358 --> 29:05.675
Why didn't you tell me?

29:05.693 --> 29:07.027
Well, 'cause I had
a funny feeling if I did,

29:07.061 --> 29:09.029
you'd react the way
you're reacting right now.

29:09.063 --> 29:10.513
Yeah, Derek, I'm right to.
It's disgusting.

29:10.531 --> 29:11.981
[Laughs]
Okay.

29:12.015 --> 29:13.500
I can't believe I almost
let something happen between us.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.652
Oh, my God, how is this
now suddenly about you?

29:15.686 --> 29:17.737
Well, because it's
always about you.

29:17.788 --> 29:20.457
- Okay.
- So is that it?

29:20.491 --> 29:22.208
She just... she wins?

29:22.243 --> 29:24.210

of dancers' accusations

29:24.245 --> 29:26.129
go away quick,
all right?

29:28.966 --> 29:30.867

29:30.901 --> 29:33.653
And if Jerry hates her,

29:33.688 --> 29:35.505
I can tell Daisy
it's not up to me.

29:35.539 --> 29:36.739
And what happens
if she's good?

29:36.757 --> 29:39.375
I have no choice.

29:41.512 --> 29:44.364
Yeah, Derek, you do.

29:44.398 --> 29:47.400
It's a pretty clear choice.

this is gonna work?

38:58.322 --> 39:00.082
We start writing
the rest of the transitions.

39:00.124 --> 39:02.358
You know,
we got 20 scenes...

39:02.377 --> 39:04.494
Newsreels after all of them.

39:04.528 --> 39:07.247
I'm sorry, um, I can't.

39:07.298 --> 39:08.799
You can't...
Wh... you can't what?

39:08.833 --> 39:12.636
I agreed to help Derek and you
transfer the show,

39:12.670 --> 39:15.672
but I don't feel comfortable
writing anything.

39:15.706 --> 39:17.724
No, no, Julia...
Julia, I'm not a writer.

39:17.759 --> 39:19.726
I can't do this by myself.

39:19.761 --> 39:22.763
Yes, you can.

39:24.565 --> 39:26.066
Is this about <i>Bombshell?</i>

39:26.100 --> 39:28.151
'Cause you were totally
into helping me

39:28.186 --> 39:30.053
until you went down
to that concert.

39:30.071 --> 39:32.439
This was always supposed
to be temporary.

39:32.490 --> 39:35.108
You know
what you need to do now.

39:35.159 --> 39:37.560
I have a show too, and I owe it
to them to be there.

39:37.578 --> 39:38.862
No, no, I get it.

39:38.896 --> 39:40.831
We're your competition.

39:40.865 --> 39:43.083
We're colleagues.

39:43.117 --> 39:45.335
Take care, Julia.
[Beep]

39:49.290 --> 39:51.291
Jerry loved her.

39:51.342 --> 39:52.426
I'm sorry.

39:52.460 --> 39:54.544
You're sorry?
That's not good enough.

39:54.578 --> 39:55.862
Derek, stand up to her.

39:55.897 --> 39:57.414
She's never gonna
release that tape.

39:57.448 --> 39:58.849
She just wants
to hold it over you forever.

39:58.883 --> 40:00.717
Yeah, well,
I can't take that risk.

40:00.752 --> 40:02.919
The stuff in the fall
was bad enough.

40:02.937 --> 40:05.639
- Derek, this is my job.
- Yeah, it's my career.

40:05.690 --> 40:07.924
And honestly,
you'll get another job.

40:07.942 --> 40:11.027
Are you kidding me?

40:11.062 --> 40:12.195
Derek.

40:12.230 --> 40:13.596
Hey!
How'd it go?

40:13.614 --> 40:15.732
- It went great.
- Yeah?

40:15.766 --> 40:17.234
David Cromer wants
to do a workshop with me.

40:17.268 --> 40:18.652
- Yeah!
- [Laughs]

40:18.703 --> 40:19.820
What about your show?

40:19.871 --> 40:21.288
He didn't look too happy.

40:21.322 --> 40:22.789
I don't know.

40:22.824 --> 40:24.107
Something's up.

40:24.125 --> 40:25.542
It's been a crazy day.

40:25.576 --> 40:27.277
[Phone ringing]

40:27.295 --> 40:28.462
Ivy?

40:28.496 --> 40:31.281
Ana Vargas from <i>Hit List,</i>
or I was.

40:31.299 --> 40:32.549
Oh, yeah.
I know who you are.

40:32.583 --> 40:34.167
Was?
What's going on?

40:34.218 --> 40:35.469
Derek just fired me.

40:35.503 --> 40:36.553
He fired you?

40:36.587 --> 40:37.838
He fired you too, right?

40:37.889 --> 40:39.389
After the workshop
last year?

40:39.423 --> 40:42.225
Well, that's not exactly
how it happened.

40:42.260 --> 40:43.626
Was it because you stopped
sleeping with him?

40:43.644 --> 40:45.645
- Whoa, Ana...
- Excuse me?

40:45.680 --> 40:48.464
I'm sorry.
Karen told me the story, okay?

40:48.483 --> 40:50.133
What story?

40:50.151 --> 40:52.602
You know, how he wanted
to sleep with her,

40:52.636 --> 40:54.321
and she said no,
but then you did,

40:54.355 --> 40:55.605
and you got the part.

40:55.639 --> 40:57.324
Is that what Karen said?

40:57.358 --> 40:58.942
- What else did she tell you?
- No...

40:58.976 --> 41:00.193
I'm not blaming you.

41:00.244 --> 41:01.695
It's Derek
who's doing something wrong,

41:01.746 --> 41:03.479
and I'm trying to stop it
before it happens again.

41:03.498 --> 41:04.981
Hey, Ivy, you don't...

41:04.999 --> 41:06.249
[Phone ringing, stops]

41:06.284 --> 41:07.483
Hey.

41:07.502 --> 41:09.652
I thought we were
gonna be adults about this.

41:09.670 --> 41:10.710
What are you
talking about?

41:10.755 --> 41:12.839
You have no right
telling anyone

41:12.874 --> 41:15.759
that I slept with Derek
to get a part or anything else.

41:15.793 --> 41:17.327
Okay, wait,
first of all,

41:17.361 --> 41:19.963
if you're talking
about me telling Ana,

41:19.997 --> 41:21.348
she's my...
my best friend.

41:21.382 --> 41:23.300
And second, Ivy, every...

41:23.334 --> 41:24.601
Everyone already knows.

41:24.635 --> 41:26.836
If it's coming to bite you
in the ass,

41:26.854 --> 41:28.255
maybe that's on you.

41:28.289 --> 41:31.107
You play this naive,
just-off-the-bus routine

41:31.142 --> 41:32.475
to get exactly
what you want.

41:32.510 --> 41:34.510
But deep down,
you're just as calculating

41:34.529 --> 41:36.279
as the next person.

41:36.314 --> 41:38.014
You being
the next person?

41:38.032 --> 41:39.783
Oh, you really wanna
play it like that?

41:39.817 --> 41:41.351
I'm not playing anything.

41:41.369 --> 41:43.403
[Scoffs]
You know what?

41:43.454 --> 41:46.456
I'm actually glad that
<i>Hit List</i> made it to Broadway

41:46.490 --> 41:48.691
'cause the only thing better
than getting a Tony

41:48.709 --> 41:50.126
will be beating you
to get it.

41:50.161 --> 41:52.379
Yeah, okay.
I think we're done here.

41:52.413 --> 41:53.529
See you
on the red carpet.

41:53.548 --> 41:55.465
If you make it there.

41:55.499 --> 41:57.918
[Phone ringing]

41:57.969 --> 42:00.170
Really, three times
in a row?

42:00.204 --> 42:02.705
- Ivy Lynn?
- Yeah?

42:02.723 --> 42:05.041
This is
Dr. Lopez's office.

42:05.059 --> 42:07.093
We got the results
of your blood test back

42:07.144 --> 42:08.762
and wanted to reach you
right away.

42:08.796 --> 42:10.730
Why, is...
Is everything okay?

42:10.765 --> 42:12.432
Congratulations.

42:12.483 --> 42:15.068
You're pregnant.
