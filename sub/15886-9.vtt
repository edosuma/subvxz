10:13.981 --> 10:16.247
(sal)
what?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.983
[squeaky fart]

10:19.352 --> 10:20.652
Sorry about that, man.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.886
Of course.

10:21.888 --> 10:22.988
[bell chimes]

10:22.990 --> 10:25.824
Change is coming.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.361
[bell chimes]

10:32.465 --> 10:33.898
The craziest part
of all of this,

10:33.900 --> 10:35.634
I actually am
on acid right now.

10:35.636 --> 10:36.635
Are you right now?

10:36.637 --> 10:37.369
- Yeah.
- Wow.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.270
Like, for instance,
I don't even--

10:39.272 --> 10:41.506
I'm 90% sure you're here.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.440
[laughs]

10:42.442 --> 10:44.476
But if I shut my eyes
and you weren't,

10:44.478 --> 10:45.877
I would not be surprised.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.845
You would not be surprised

10:46.847 --> 10:48.913
If this car just kind of
lifted off in the air

10:48.915 --> 10:51.049
And just started driving
through space

10:51.051 --> 10:51.850
With a rainbow trail.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.486
- Mm-hmm.
- You would not be surprised.

10:54.488 --> 10:58.356
Hey, none of this is real,
man.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.925
None of this is real,
okay?

11:00.927 --> 11:02.527
Just surface--

11:02.529 --> 11:04.996
[screaming]

11:07.600 --> 11:08.700
- Yo.
- What's up?

11:08.702 --> 11:09.968
<i>Game of thrones,</i>
though, dog.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.703
Yo, you all caught up?

11:11.705 --> 11:12.937
Yo, I totally binge-watched

11:12.939 --> 11:14.172
That whole thing
last night, dog.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.375
Yo, it's cold-blooded
up in westeros, dog.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.744
They killed my [bleep] ned!

11:19.746 --> 11:20.645
Ned starks?

11:20.647 --> 11:24.015
[hums<i> game of thrones</i>
theme song]

11:24.017 --> 11:25.650
You ain't see that one
coming, did you?

11:25.652 --> 11:27.552
- Oh, [bleep], hell no.
- Uh-uh.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.486
- Oh, my god.
- Uh-uh.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.288
I mean, my man
was just there, right?

11:30.290 --> 11:31.790
And he got down there
on the thing.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.224
- Like blip.
- [makes sword noise]

11:33.226 --> 11:34.392
And then I was like,
"I ain't worried.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.194
They ain't gonna kill
my boy ned starks!"

11:36.196 --> 11:37.696
- Slit.
- And then plop.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.730
I was like...

11:38.732 --> 11:39.297
[screaming]

11:39.299 --> 11:41.566
Yo, I told you they
cold-blooded up in there.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.734
And then I was like,
"but that's okay,

11:42.736 --> 11:45.103
Because I still got
my [bleep] khal drogos."

11:45.105 --> 11:46.037
Big dave navarro?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.238
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.106
Big dave navarro?

11:48.108 --> 11:50.208
Widdly-widdly-widdly
widdly-wow!

11:50.210 --> 11:52.210
Yeah, that dude picked up
some molten gold,

11:52.212 --> 11:53.945
Poured it
on [bleep] heads.

11:53.947 --> 11:54.746
[screaming]

11:54.748 --> 11:56.581
"I want to sleep
with my sister!"

11:56.583 --> 11:57.248
Yo.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.049
And he killed him, right?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.651
I mean, he big like hercules
and everything.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.586
I'm like, you can't
kill khal drogos

12:01.588 --> 12:02.287
With a paper cut.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.688
An infected scratch
up on there?

12:03.690 --> 12:04.556
An infected scratch!

12:04.558 --> 12:05.623
- But he got straight...
(both) killed!

12:05.625 --> 12:08.326
Yo, but you know who my
favorite character is, dog?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.194
Who's that, dog?

12:09.196 --> 12:10.528
Pssst!
Khaleesies.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.029
Khaleesi.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.298
You know I be liking
some khaleesies, dog.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.066
But what about khaleesies

12:15.068 --> 12:16.868
Straight-up
with the dragons?

12:16.870 --> 12:17.969
Oh, it's--

12:17.971 --> 12:19.571
Khaleesies
with the dragons.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.106
And khaleesi's
all like this.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.142
And then we talking about--
[screeching]

12:24.144 --> 12:25.043
[screeching]

12:25.045 --> 12:26.478
[both screeching]

12:26.480 --> 12:27.078
Whoosh!

12:27.080 --> 12:28.680
Just straight
roasting goats!

12:28.682 --> 12:29.581
Yo!

12:29.583 --> 12:30.381
Oh, my god.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.282
And that's when they start

12:31.284 --> 12:33.251
Killing characters
left and right, dog!

12:33.253 --> 12:35.386
- At the wedding?
- Yo, at the wedding!

12:35.388 --> 12:36.421
- Robb starks.
- What?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.322
- His wife.
- What?

12:37.324 --> 12:38.523
- They got his mama!
- Yo!

12:38.525 --> 12:40.859
(both)
killed, killed, killed, killed!

12:40.861 --> 12:42.060
That was a four-for-one, dog.

12:42.062 --> 12:42.994
Four-for-one up there, dog.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.262
That's a straight
four-for-one, dog.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.029
Four-for-one up in there.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.498
What about when they
got wildlings girl?

12:46.500 --> 12:47.198
Talking about...

12:47.200 --> 12:49.200
"you know nothing,
jon snow."

12:49.202 --> 12:50.902
- Screek!
- Guh!

12:50.904 --> 12:51.736
(both)
killed!

12:51.738 --> 12:52.837
What about the hound, though?

12:52.839 --> 12:53.638
- Yo!
- The hound!

12:53.640 --> 12:55.306
"ah, I'm falling
down the hill!"

12:55.308 --> 12:56.808
[indistinct shouting]

12:56.810 --> 12:58.042
[humming]

12:58.044 --> 12:58.810
"kill me!

12:58.812 --> 13:00.211
You've got to kill me!"

13:00.213 --> 13:01.312
[high-pitched]
"no!"

13:01.314 --> 13:02.347
(both)
killed!

13:02.349 --> 13:03.581
Slowly, by omission.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.048
Bingo.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.017
Yo, what about my man
taiwan lannisters?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.018
Taiwan lannisters.

13:07.020 --> 13:07.819
Taiwan lannisters!

13:07.821 --> 13:09.154
What about taiwan lannisters,
dog?

13:09.156 --> 13:10.388
Yo, my man talking about,

13:10.390 --> 13:12.023
"I'm taking a [bleep]."

13:12.025 --> 13:14.759
He's like--ow!

13:14.761 --> 13:15.860
(both)
killed!

13:15.862 --> 13:16.995
By his own son.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.029
What?

13:18.031 --> 13:19.063
Da dinkles.

13:19.065 --> 13:19.998
[gasps]

13:20.000 --> 13:20.965
Da dinkles.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.000
Da dinkles, yo.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.368
Da dinkles.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.235
Da dinkles!

13:24.237 --> 13:25.336
Dinkles is my jam.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.638
Can't nobody kill da dinkles!

13:26.640 --> 13:28.139
Da dinkles is my jam,
my jelly,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.841
My peanut butter,
and my peanuts.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.509
- Dinkles.
- Da dinkles.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.077
Dinkles, though!

13:33.079 --> 13:38.716
(both)
dinkles is my [bleep]!

13:38.718 --> 13:41.753
[voices fading]

13:41.755 --> 13:48.693
[dramatic music]

13:48.695 --> 13:51.930
(woman)
neil!

13:51.932 --> 13:53.598
There you are.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.399
What are you doing?

13:54.401 --> 13:57.235
We have to go
to my aunt nelly's funeral.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.204
How are you not ready?

13:59.206 --> 14:01.739
I've been talking to you
about this all week.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.875
How am I gonna find you
in your boxers

14:03.877 --> 14:06.511
Looking in
a science magazine?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.478
[sighs]

14:07.480 --> 14:09.147
I swear, neil,

14:09.149 --> 14:09.981
Sometimes I think

14:09.983 --> 14:14.352
You don't have any idea
of what's important.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.222
Well...Actually...

14:17.224 --> 14:19.424
An idea of what's important

14:19.426 --> 14:21.392
Is as close
as we can ever come

14:21.394 --> 14:24.696
To any definition
of importance.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.331
Our galaxy is one

14:26.333 --> 14:30.401
Of over 100 billion
in the observable universe,

14:30.403 --> 14:33.838
And it's 100,000
light-years across,

14:33.840 --> 14:39.110
Which means it would take light
100,000 years to traverse.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.178
Okay, but--

14:40.180 --> 14:41.913
But that's just space.

14:41.915 --> 14:46.251
If we were to chart
the history of the universe

14:46.253 --> 14:47.986
On one calendar year,

14:47.988 --> 14:51.022
The history of mankind
as we know it,

14:51.024 --> 14:51.956
Would just take place

14:51.958 --> 14:53.858
In the final second
of that year.

14:53.860 --> 14:58.696
So, whether I'm ready now
or in 500 years,

14:58.698 --> 15:00.798
Well, cosmically speaking,

15:00.800 --> 15:04.269
The distinction is meaningless.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.838
Well...Okay.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.944
I'm--I'm going now.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.982
Good-bye, honey.

15:21.420 --> 15:21.953
True story.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.422
I went down to san francisco
with my girlfriend.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.189
Brup-brup-brup.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.591
And we were going
to an event,

15:26.593 --> 15:28.626
And bill nye
the science guy...

15:28.628 --> 15:30.161
[gasps]
was there?

15:30.163 --> 15:30.895
No joke.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.397
Bill nye
hit on my girlfriend

15:32.399 --> 15:33.865
In front of my face.

15:33.867 --> 15:34.832
Did he really?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.935
Bill nye the science guy...

15:36.937 --> 15:38.903
You need the back
the [bleep] up.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.371
Dude, pussy hound, man.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.007
That guy
has laid down pipe.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.909
Probably
polycarbonate pipe.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.177
Probably.

15:48.914 --> 15:52.317

15:59.125 --> 16:00.024

16:09.436 --> 16:10.868
Can I have a few moments
of your time

16:10.870 --> 16:12.804
To tell you
about this new package?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.205
You know what,
I would love to,

16:14.207 --> 16:16.341
But I just don't have the time.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.709
[phone beeps]

16:17.711 --> 16:19.277
Hello?

master travel incorporated.

16:52.746 --> 16:53.811
How may I be of service?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.179
Hi, colin valenti.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.547
My name is gavin.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.915
I think we just talked.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.450
Did we get disconnected?

16:59.452 --> 17:03.187
(colin)
yeah, no--I mean, yeah,
I hung up on you.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.891
Why would you do that?

17:06.893 --> 17:08.359
I mean, are you even--

17:08.361 --> 17:10.328
Are you even allowed
to do that?

17:10.330 --> 17:13.331
(colin)
were you going to buy
the las vegas package?

17:13.333 --> 17:16.000
Well, I mean, probably not,
but that's not the point.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.201
(gavin)
the point is--

17:17.203 --> 17:18.636
[phone beeps]

17:18.638 --> 17:19.637
What the hell?

17:19.639 --> 17:21.205

17:21.207 --> 17:22.740
[line trilling]

17:22.742 --> 17:23.775

this is colin--

17:23.777 --> 17:24.709
Yeah, valenti.
Listen.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.511
(gavin)
I don't know what
crawled up your ass

17:26.513 --> 17:28.246
And set up shop there,
but you don't get to hang up--

17:28.248 --> 17:30.415
[phone beeps]
[gasps]

17:30.417 --> 17:32.517

17:40.627 --> 17:42.026
What is your deal, huh?

17:42.028 --> 17:44.796
(colin)
um, you don't want
the vegas package,

17:44.798 --> 17:45.863
So I don't want to talk.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.598
I did us a favor,
wasting our time here.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.133
(gavin)
stop, stop, don't you dare

17:49.135 --> 17:52.770
Hang up that [bleep] phone,
okay?

17:52.772 --> 17:54.172
(colin)
why shouldn't I?

17:54.174 --> 17:55.139
Why shou--

17:55.141 --> 17:57.408
What if I wanted
the vegas package?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.077
Wha--you know what?

17:59.079 --> 18:01.612
I want the vegas package.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.382
(colin)
sure you do.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.516
[phone beeps]

18:05.518 --> 18:06.584

18:06.586 --> 18:08.686
You mother[bleep]!

Oh, my god!

18:09.789 --> 18:11.122
You son of a bitch.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.391
[line trilling]

18:13.393 --> 18:15.626
(colin)
come on, man, let it go.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.761
[bleep] you, man!

18:16.763 --> 18:17.462
[bleep] you!

18:17.464 --> 18:19.864
I want five [bleep] packages!

18:19.866 --> 18:20.731
Right now--you know what?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.200
(gavin)
you know what?
Where's my wallet?

18:22.202 --> 18:24.368
This is my credit card
number, right here.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.403
Okay, listen.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.204
Get [bleep] off me.

18:26.206 --> 18:30.975
My credit card number
is 0074-5403-0098.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.377
The expiration date
is 12-20!

18:33.379 --> 18:35.012
And then--and then the--
oh, yeah!

18:35.014 --> 18:36.948
The security number is 084!

18:36.950 --> 18:39.383
So run the damn card right now!

18:39.385 --> 18:40.184
Right [bleep] now!

18:40.186 --> 18:42.553
You run it right [bleep] now,
asshole!

18:42.555 --> 18:46.023
[suspenseful music]

18:46.025 --> 18:47.925
(colin)
thank you for your business.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.728
Well, I hope
you learned your le--

18:50.730 --> 18:52.530
[phone beeps]
[gasps]

18:52.532 --> 18:54.765
[screaming]

18:57.136 --> 19:00.338
These new call scripts
are really great.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.672
Yeah, I know, right?

19:01.674 --> 19:02.507
[phone rings]

19:02.509 --> 19:10.248
What the [bleep]
do you want, kathy?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.250
(woman)
neil!

19:12.252 --> 19:13.317
Who is she?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.352
Who is the white bitch

19:14.354 --> 19:17.455
That left this
goddamn lipstick stain

19:17.457 --> 19:19.457
On your collar?

19:19.459 --> 19:20.858
Hmm?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.994
Oh, I got you.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.228
You're caught,

19:24.230 --> 19:26.330
Because this
is apricot-colored,

19:26.332 --> 19:27.765
And you know
who wears that?

19:27.767 --> 19:28.666
White bitches.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.601
And you can't talk your way
out of this one,

19:30.603 --> 19:32.370
'cause I'm not
getting confused today,

19:32.372 --> 19:33.771
'cause I got
my [bleep] in order

19:33.773 --> 19:35.506
And I've done
my research.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.240
Okay, neil?

19:36.242 --> 19:41.612
You see, we are here
at this point in space-time,

19:41.614 --> 19:42.747
On a human scale.

19:42.749 --> 19:43.848
But at this point,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.017
You a triflin'-ass
mother[bleep].

19:46.019 --> 19:48.619
So expect the papers
from the lawyer,

19:48.621 --> 19:51.022
'cause we're parting ways.

19:52.658 --> 19:55.426
Well, actually...

19:55.428 --> 19:56.260
No, no.

19:56.262 --> 20:00.097
We are always parting ways
and not parting ways

20:00.099 --> 20:03.501
In every conceivable
combination.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.837
Many physicists,
including stephen hawking,

20:06.839 --> 20:08.206
Now believe that there is

20:08.208 --> 20:11.609
An infinite number
of universes.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.944
It's called multiverse theory,

20:12.946 --> 20:16.714
And it suggests that there are
an infinite number of universes

20:16.716 --> 20:20.918
In which I didn't have sex
with that white woman.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.354
I [bleep] bill nye
the science guy.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.256
You bitch.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.495
Bill nye, little bitch.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.598
Looking like a pimple

20:33.600 --> 20:35.833
That I'm about to itch.

20:35.835 --> 20:40.805
Scratch off your head,
mother[bleep].

20:40.807 --> 20:43.608
[voice cracking]
try and take my girl?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.509
You a sucker.

20:48.547 --> 20:51.816
(keegan-michael)
none of this is real.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.686

my one line here ♪

20:58.191 --> 21:00.391
Oh, yeah.

His dick was as big
as the milky way.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.667
You [bleep] bitch.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.036
And as heavy as a quasar.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.472
You are a black hole,

21:14.474 --> 21:14.505
Sucking up
every man you meet.
