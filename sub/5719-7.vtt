WEBVTT

00:00.188 --> 00:01.888
Previously on Heartland...

00:01.988 --> 00:03.890
We will be moved in soon.

00:03.924 --> 00:06.559
I'm just so excited to be able
to have a place on our own.

00:06.593 --> 00:08.093
What the... ?

00:08.129 --> 00:09.495
What happened to finishing the loft?!

00:09.529 --> 00:11.131
What the heck have you been doing?!

00:11.165 --> 00:13.166
It's almost the same as it was when I left.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.901
You haven't even done anything.

00:15.935 --> 00:18.971
Hey Amy, we got water!

00:20.440 --> 00:23.509
First night in our new place.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

00:58.211 --> 01:00.545
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:02.048 --> 01:04.349
- Oh.
- Look at this place.

01:04.382 --> 01:06.017
Do you believe we live here?

01:06.051 --> 01:07.485
Yeah.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.153
It all came together, didn't it?

01:09.188 --> 01:11.589
All the planning, the picking out flooring,

01:11.624 --> 01:13.658
tiling, paint colours...

01:13.693 --> 01:15.827
it was all worth it.

01:15.861 --> 01:17.629
You know what? We should
have some people over.

01:17.663 --> 01:19.163
You know, show it off.

01:19.198 --> 01:22.033
Hm. Like a house warming party?

01:22.067 --> 01:25.303
Yeah, only let's keep it
small. Nothing too crazy.

01:25.338 --> 01:27.905
Okay. We can have a bunch
of people over for dinner.

01:27.940 --> 01:30.141
Our table only seats four.

01:30.175 --> 01:33.344
Okay, you, me, Cass and Caleb.

01:33.378 --> 01:35.379
Okay.

01:35.414 --> 01:36.279
Yeah, it'll be our first dinner
party as a married couple.

01:36.314 --> 01:37.981
We're so grown up.

01:40.485 --> 01:43.053
I'm gonna be waiting right
here for you when you get back.

01:43.087 --> 01:45.288
Bye Mommy. Bye Grandpa.

01:45.323 --> 01:49.292
Bye sweetie. Have a fun day.

01:51.662 --> 01:52.929
Bye.

02:03.975 --> 02:05.909
There she goes...

02:05.943 --> 02:07.978
Her first day of kindergarten.

02:08.012 --> 02:12.314
You know, I thought I was
gonna cry, but I think I'm okay.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.116
Thanks for being here, Dad.

02:15.618 --> 02:17.519
Dad? You okay?

02:19.589 --> 02:21.257
Yes, hay fever.

02:23.860 --> 02:27.963
We should go. The diner
is not gonna run itself.

02:42.344 --> 02:43.945
Where have you taken me?

02:48.017 --> 02:50.584
- Let's go. Come on.
- Ya!

02:51.924 --> 02:53.892
I gotta head into the barn. I
got a few booster shots to do.

02:53.926 --> 02:55.293
I shouldn't be too long, okay?

02:55.327 --> 02:56.527
Okay. I'm just gonna have a look around.

02:56.561 --> 02:58.496
Okay.

03:45.575 --> 03:48.209
Hey there, I can tell
you're no damsel in distress,

03:48.244 --> 03:50.245
but you do look a little lost.

03:50.279 --> 03:52.213
My husband is here on a vet call.

03:52.248 --> 03:53.848
I'm just waiting for him to finish up.

03:53.882 --> 03:55.550
Not exactly the kind of
thing you'd expect to see

03:55.584 --> 03:57.152
at a ranch in southern Alberta, huh?

03:57.186 --> 03:59.087
No, not at all.

03:59.121 --> 04:01.122
- I'm Tristan.
- Hi. Amy. Who's this?

04:01.157 --> 04:02.590
This is Abbey.

04:02.624 --> 04:04.659
I rescued her from a
meat truck six years ago.

04:04.693 --> 04:06.226
Wow, that's awesome.

04:06.261 --> 04:08.529
I work with horses for a living,

04:08.563 --> 04:12.099
I have to admit, I have
never seen anything like this.

04:12.133 --> 04:15.469
Amy? Amy Fleming? The miracle girl.

04:15.503 --> 04:16.937
Isn't that what they used to call you.

04:16.971 --> 04:18.338
Yes. A long time ago.

04:18.373 --> 04:20.607
- It's an honour to meet you.
- Thanks.

04:23.178 --> 04:25.078
- I better go.
- Okay. Well, good luck.

04:25.112 --> 04:26.479
Thanks.

04:26.513 --> 04:29.549
Here you go.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.250
More coffee? yeah.

04:31.285 --> 04:32.918
Guess who just aced her drivers test?

04:32.953 --> 04:35.388
What? I knew you would do it.

04:35.422 --> 04:37.256
They let kids your age drive?
What is wrong with this country?

04:37.291 --> 04:38.657
It's just a learners permit.

04:38.692 --> 04:41.494
All I had to do was pass
a multiple choice exam.

04:41.528 --> 04:42.828
But it means I can start
taking driving lessons

04:42.862 --> 04:45.263
from anyone who's over
eighteen and has their licence.

04:45.298 --> 04:47.199
Someone like Jade.

04:47.233 --> 04:49.134
Uh, no. That is not happening.

04:49.168 --> 04:52.137
If you want driving lessons,
you're stuck with me or your dad.

04:52.171 --> 04:55.373
- Or I could do it.
- Really?

04:55.408 --> 04:57.576
- Well, can we start today?
- What's your hurry?

04:57.610 --> 04:59.277
Well, I wanna get as
much practice in as I can

04:59.312 --> 05:00.878
before school starts next week.

05:00.913 --> 05:02.514
Right. Okay.

05:02.548 --> 05:05.917
All right, meet me at
Heartland. 2:00pm. Don't be late.

05:05.951 --> 05:08.452
All right, I'll be there.

05:08.487 --> 05:10.554
I hope you know what you're getting into.

05:10.589 --> 05:12.523
Actually, I am excited about this.

05:12.557 --> 05:15.326
I never got to teach you
or your sister how to drive.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.528
Well, you should be happy
because I was a nightmare

05:17.562 --> 05:19.998
when Mom started giving me lessons so.

05:20.032 --> 05:23.166
Honey I'm serious, I missed that.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.969
This is a second chance.

05:31.509 --> 05:34.277
Hey, Amy. I'm all done. You ready to go?

05:34.311 --> 05:36.079
Just give me one minute.

05:36.114 --> 05:38.414
Look at this.

05:38.449 --> 05:40.550
- That's Tristan. I just met him.
- Thank you.

05:40.584 --> 05:43.585
Oh...

05:47.457 --> 05:49.191
Ready!

05:49.225 --> 05:51.193
Easy girl, easy!

06:34.869 --> 06:39.869
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:41.748 --> 06:44.583
Well, there is no
inflammation in the joints.

06:44.617 --> 06:46.719
There is no hot spots, that I can tell.

06:46.753 --> 06:48.687
I can run some more
tests if you like, though.

06:48.722 --> 06:51.423
She's had every test run twice, maybe more.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.159
So this isn't the first time it's happened?

06:53.193 --> 06:56.395
No. Last year something spooked
her at a tournament in BC.

06:56.429 --> 06:57.730
It was at the start of the second pass.

06:57.764 --> 06:59.731
Abbey suddenly reared
up and lost her footing.

06:59.765 --> 07:01.399
She hit the wooden
barrier and we went down.

07:01.433 --> 07:02.968
Was she injured?

07:03.002 --> 07:04.903
She had a pretty severe
laceration on her upper leg.

07:04.937 --> 07:06.404
But the vet did a good
job stitching her up.

07:06.438 --> 07:08.439
- There's barely a scar.
- How about you?

07:08.474 --> 07:11.376
Broken collar bone. I'm all good now.

07:11.410 --> 07:12.710
I figured Abbey and I could
just pick up where we left off,

07:12.745 --> 07:16.581
but every time we start
the charge, she freaks out.

07:16.615 --> 07:18.482
I don't know what to do anymore.

07:18.516 --> 07:20.317
If you want, I could take a look at her.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.753
Really? Well, that'll be amazing.

07:22.787 --> 07:24.821
Why don't you bring her over
to Heartland this afternoon.

07:24.855 --> 07:27.724
- We can go from there.
- Okay.

07:30.328 --> 07:32.462
Whoa. Whoa. Easy.

07:32.497 --> 07:34.064
Slowdown.

07:34.099 --> 07:36.633
This is a lot of truck
for a little beginner.

07:36.747 --> 07:40.416
We're going to take
things one step at a time.

07:40.451 --> 07:41.818
Okay. Well, I'm ready to learn.

07:41.853 --> 07:45.288
- What's the first step?
- The walk around.

07:45.322 --> 07:46.823
It's where you walk around the vehicle

07:46.858 --> 07:49.593
You'd be scanning for any
obstructions or hazards.

07:49.627 --> 07:52.562
So go ahead, walk around.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.764
All the way around. All around.

07:58.267 --> 08:00.102
That's it.

08:07.310 --> 08:08.611
Looks good to me.

08:08.645 --> 08:11.146
Really? Sure about that?

08:11.180 --> 08:13.516
Yeah...

08:17.553 --> 08:19.253
Then what is this?

08:19.287 --> 08:20.822
A tiny nail.

08:20.856 --> 08:26.193
Tiny, yes, but big enough
to be a potential hazard.

08:26.228 --> 08:28.029
That can wreak havoc.

08:28.063 --> 08:30.331
Yeah, but there's no way
you could have seen that,

08:30.365 --> 08:31.699
unless you put it there on purpose.

08:31.734 --> 08:33.200
Doesn't matter where it came from.

08:33.235 --> 08:36.102
- But you set me up.
- Did not.

08:36.138 --> 08:38.839
Georgie this just demonstrates the dangers

08:38.873 --> 08:41.409
that can present themselves
if you're not observant.

08:41.443 --> 08:43.677
So next time, look more carefully.

08:43.711 --> 08:46.780
- But...
- You said you were here to learn?

08:46.814 --> 08:49.550
I'll be more careful next time.

08:49.584 --> 08:52.586
Good. Now get in the truck.

09:02.463 --> 09:05.130
- What?
- I need the keys.

09:05.165 --> 09:09.535
You're not ready for the
keys. Not today anyway.

09:09.569 --> 09:11.470
So what are we doing?

09:11.504 --> 09:14.005
I just want you to get
a feel for the truck,

09:14.040 --> 09:17.409
start with the correct hand
position on the steering wheel...

09:17.444 --> 09:20.145
nine o'clock, three o'clock.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.314
That's... no...

09:22.348 --> 09:25.084
See, that's one, maybe five to one...

09:25.118 --> 09:29.188
Ten after ten. Ten fifteen.
Sloppy. Try it again.

09:31.023 --> 09:33.424
So Cass, Amy and I were... were chatting

09:33.459 --> 09:34.693
and we were thinking that maybe you guys

09:34.727 --> 09:36.394
would like to come over for dinner.

09:36.428 --> 09:38.697
Like a, you know, house
warming kinda thing.

09:38.731 --> 09:42.433
Wow, dinner at the boss's house.

09:42.468 --> 09:44.302
Well, I'm not really your boss.

09:44.336 --> 09:45.704
Mm. Scott's partner.

09:45.738 --> 09:48.439
That technically makes you my boss.

09:48.474 --> 09:50.675
Will I get fired if I say no to this.

09:50.710 --> 09:52.576
No, no, no. If you got something
else planned that's totally cool.

09:52.611 --> 09:54.344
I'm just kidding. We'd love to come.

09:54.378 --> 09:58.882
I've been dying to see your
new house-barn-thing anyway.

09:58.997 --> 10:00.564
Okay. Great.

10:00.598 --> 10:02.199
I'll bring the wine.

10:02.233 --> 10:05.669
Uh, we actually, you know,
we don't really drink wine.

10:05.704 --> 10:07.171
So that's okay. Thank you, though.

10:07.205 --> 10:09.406
I'm gonna bring it anyway.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.374
A dinner party without wine is
kind of like a BBQ without beer.

10:11.409 --> 10:12.776
Unless this is a BBQ?

10:12.811 --> 10:14.678
No, no, it's definitely a sit down,

10:14.713 --> 10:16.713
kind of nice quiet dinner thing.

10:16.747 --> 10:18.347
- Great.
- Tomorrow night.

10:18.381 --> 10:19.749
Be there around seven?

10:19.783 --> 10:22.318
- Yeah. Can't wait.
- Okay.

10:24.955 --> 10:28.357
So did you make any new
friends at school today?

10:28.391 --> 10:31.493
Yup! His name is Abraham.
And he's my boyfriend.

10:31.528 --> 10:33.529
Your boyfriend?

10:33.563 --> 10:36.398
Yep, we sat together at story time.

10:36.433 --> 10:40.702
And we made butterflies
out of tissue paper.

10:40.737 --> 10:43.205
That sounds really nice, sweetie.

10:45.541 --> 10:47.008
Come on, Abby, come on.

10:47.043 --> 10:48.576
That's it! Good girl.

10:48.611 --> 10:50.278
Whoa.

11:12.534 --> 11:14.435
New client?

11:14.570 --> 11:16.536
Yeah, she's a medieval jousting
horse if you can believe it.

11:16.571 --> 11:18.872
Wait, did you say jousting horse?

11:18.906 --> 11:21.275
Until today, I thought I'd seen everything.

11:21.309 --> 11:22.709
Do you need a hand?

11:22.744 --> 11:25.445
I think I'm gonna call
it a day. Thanks though.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.815
Oh. I heard that you got your
learners permit. Congrats.

11:28.849 --> 11:31.151
Yeah. Thanks.

11:31.185 --> 11:33.219
Do you think you might have some
time to take me out driving tomorrow?

11:33.254 --> 11:34.621
I'd love to, but I should
probably work with Abbey.

11:34.656 --> 11:35.955
I'll talk to Ty, though.
He might have time.

11:35.990 --> 11:37.323
Yeah. Sure. That would be awesome.

11:37.357 --> 11:38.825
Okay.

11:40.261 --> 11:41.694
Hey, whatcha up to?

11:41.728 --> 11:44.530
I'm just trying to learn
everything I can about jousting.

11:44.564 --> 11:46.900
Hmm. Well, I did my research too.

11:46.934 --> 11:49.635
This is Scott's file on Abbey.
He did a post-op examination

11:49.670 --> 11:52.338
after she came back from
the tournament in BC.

11:52.372 --> 11:55.474
It was a pretty deep wound, but
Scott was happy with how it healed.

11:55.509 --> 11:58.311
So whatever's going on with
Abbey, it's not physical.

11:58.345 --> 12:00.012
No. Doesn't seem like it.

12:00.046 --> 12:01.546
I'm not surprised.

12:01.580 --> 12:03.481
I only worked with her for
a couple of hours today,

12:03.516 --> 12:05.217
and already she's gaining confidence.

12:05.251 --> 12:07.319
I'd say in a few days, I
should have her back to normal.

12:07.353 --> 12:09.654
Well, that's good.

12:09.689 --> 12:12.191
Yeah, I'm just worried that as
soon as Tristan gets back on her,

12:12.225 --> 12:14.392
she's gonna regress.

12:14.427 --> 12:15.861
But why do you think that?

12:15.895 --> 12:18.197
Tristan broke his collar
bone in the accident.

12:18.231 --> 12:20.866
That's pretty serious. It would
have taken him weeks to recover.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.467
He was probably just
as traumatized as Abbey?

12:23.970 --> 12:25.670
It's possible that without even thinking it

12:25.705 --> 12:28.640
he's transferring his fear back to Abbey.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.614
- Hello.
- Hey, Dad.

12:38.984 --> 12:40.652
Hey. How was your first
day of kindergarten, Missy?

12:40.686 --> 12:42.387
It was awesome!

12:42.421 --> 12:44.556
Good. That's what I like to hear.

12:44.590 --> 12:45.922
So I thought I drop by and see

12:45.957 --> 12:47.825
if you wanted to go
out and do some driving.

12:47.859 --> 12:51.194
- Right now?
- You have other plans?

12:51.229 --> 12:52.963
Well, yeah...

12:52.997 --> 12:55.432
Lou and I were gonna go shopping
for back to school clothes?

12:55.467 --> 12:57.534
You want to go shopping?

12:57.569 --> 12:59.903
- Yeah. Totally.
- Are you feeling okay?

12:59.937 --> 13:02.473
Yeah. I just really need some new jeans.

13:02.507 --> 13:05.509
And that can't wait an hour or two? Or...

13:05.543 --> 13:07.177
You want to learn to drive or not?

13:07.211 --> 13:11.414
Your grandpa is right, we can
head to the mall this afternoon.

13:11.448 --> 13:13.683
Okay.

13:13.717 --> 13:16.151
Okay. Let's get a move on.

13:18.655 --> 13:20.656
- Have fun.
- Okay.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.827
I think maybe I've known all along
that Abbey wasn't the problem.

13:24.862 --> 13:26.396
I'm leaving her without leadership

13:26.430 --> 13:27.730
right when she needs it the most.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.298
- It's not your fault.
- But it is.

13:29.332 --> 13:30.866
Every time I get on her, I admit it,

13:30.901 --> 13:34.503
I'm not thinking about jousting.
I'm thinking about the accident.

13:37.607 --> 13:40.209
You can come back from this. So can Abbey.

13:40.243 --> 13:42.311
After she recovers, I think
know a few worthy jousters

13:42.345 --> 13:44.280
who might be interested in buying her.

13:44.314 --> 13:46.348
What about you?

13:46.383 --> 13:49.150
I'm pretty sure my jousting days are over.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.557
Wait, does this mean I
actually get to drive today.

13:56.591 --> 13:59.394
Or is this just another test?

13:59.428 --> 14:02.263
Start the engine.

14:02.298 --> 14:05.833
We're gonna take it nice and slow.

14:08.237 --> 14:10.537
Now ease your foot off the brake

14:10.571 --> 14:14.207
and gently apply the gas.

14:14.242 --> 14:16.843
Gently! Gently! Brake!

14:16.877 --> 14:19.512
- Sorry.
- No. We're fine. I'm good.

14:19.547 --> 14:21.815
Let's do it again.

14:21.849 --> 14:24.617
A little less gas this time.

14:26.454 --> 14:28.888
Okay. Even pressure on the gas.

14:30.290 --> 14:31.691
Okay.

14:41.001 --> 14:44.904
Try to anticipate whether you
need to speed up or slow down.

14:54.313 --> 14:55.714
Sorry.

14:55.748 --> 14:59.150
Whoa. Whoa! Too fast! Too fast! Too fast.

15:02.288 --> 15:03.755
- Sorry.
- Did I say stop?

15:03.790 --> 15:05.323
Look, you're making me nervous!

15:05.358 --> 15:06.792
Speed up, slow down, make up your mind!

15:06.826 --> 15:09.795
Okay, let's just breathe. Okay?

15:11.364 --> 15:14.032
Just take it easy. You got this.

15:14.066 --> 15:15.666
Give it a little gas and let's get going.

15:15.701 --> 15:17.202
You know what, I... I forgot...

15:17.236 --> 15:19.737
I've got extreme team tonight,
I've gotta go practice.

15:19.771 --> 15:21.839
- Now?
- Yes. Right now.

15:23.509 --> 15:25.110
Okay. Fine. Fine.

15:26.745 --> 15:29.414
Let's back up. Put it in reverse.

15:29.448 --> 15:32.683
Don't go too fast.

15:32.718 --> 15:34.886
Not too fast.

15:36.622 --> 15:39.390
That's too fast. Too fast! Too fast!

15:39.424 --> 15:41.659
Whoa, relax!

15:41.693 --> 15:43.427
I can't relax when you're yelling at me.

15:43.461 --> 15:45.530
- I'm not yelling at you!
- Yes, you are!

15:45.644 --> 15:48.679
I'm yelling at you because you're
accusing me of yelling at you!

15:48.714 --> 15:52.683
You know what. I think this was a bad idea.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.986
Georgie! Oh, Georgie, wait!

16:09.416 --> 16:11.351
- Guess what?
- What?

16:13.620 --> 16:15.788
You are? To who?

16:15.823 --> 16:17.523
Abraham.

16:17.558 --> 16:20.292
Oh, well, that's very exciting.

16:23.496 --> 16:25.530
Yes. Absolutely.

16:25.565 --> 16:28.567
We'll pick it out tonight, okay?

16:28.601 --> 16:31.403
Okay, so the lasagna is in the oven.

16:31.437 --> 16:32.872
The salad is done.

16:32.906 --> 16:34.974
The table is set. I'd say
we're in pretty good shape.

16:36.276 --> 16:38.677
You don't think lasagna
is too simple, do you?

16:38.711 --> 16:41.513
No, Amy. No, not at all.

16:41.547 --> 16:43.715
I think Caleb, he's fine
with it, he's not picky.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.149
I mean, his idea of a
fancy meal is anything

16:45.184 --> 16:47.085
that doesn't come out of
a greasy, brown paper bag.

16:47.119 --> 16:50.121
Yes, but it's Cass that I'm worried about.

16:52.157 --> 16:54.625
I think Caleb is rubbing off on her.

16:59.231 --> 17:01.232
The oven isn't working. It's stone cold.

17:03.068 --> 17:05.502
Oh no, the igniter must be faulty.

17:09.775 --> 17:11.541
- Hey Dad.
- Hi...

17:11.576 --> 17:13.277
Are you gonna stay for dinner?

17:13.310 --> 17:15.445
I don't think so.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.382
Georgie, I lost my temper before.

17:19.917 --> 17:23.554
It's okay. I was the one who screwed up.

17:23.588 --> 17:26.290
I guess driving is a lot
harder than I thought.

17:26.324 --> 17:30.160
Well, you just have to be a little
more confidence on the road, that's all.

17:30.194 --> 17:34.664
I put something in the truck
that might help you with that.

17:34.698 --> 17:36.866
So what do you say you
wanna give it another try?

17:36.901 --> 17:39.669
Well, actually... I was thinking,

17:39.703 --> 17:42.906
with school starting up and extreme team,

17:44.375 --> 17:46.643
I have too much on my plate.

17:46.677 --> 17:50.246
Would it be okay, if we just
put driving lessons on hold?

17:50.280 --> 17:53.615
Yeah. No, I... I understand that.

17:53.650 --> 17:55.918
Hey! I am so sorry,
but can I use your oven?

17:55.953 --> 17:57.619
Because ours isn't working for some reason.

17:57.654 --> 17:59.055
Yeah, sure.

17:59.089 --> 18:00.589
I told you not to buy
your appliances online.

18:00.623 --> 18:04.226
Not now, Dad.

18:34.223 --> 18:36.657
You did your wedding book! That's amazing!

18:36.692 --> 18:38.360
Okay. Never mind the wedding book.

18:38.394 --> 18:40.528
This place is unbelievable!

18:40.562 --> 18:42.097
I can't believe this was the loft.

18:42.131 --> 18:44.499
Well, hey thanks, man,
we're pretty proud of it.

18:44.533 --> 18:45.833
Yeah. It's really beautiful, Ty.

18:45.868 --> 18:48.303
- Thank you.
- You see I told you.

18:48.337 --> 18:51.505
Cass was convinced this
might be a bit of a disaster.

18:51.539 --> 18:52.906
- Really?
- That is not true.

18:52.940 --> 18:55.609
I knew all along it would
be lovely and charming.

18:55.643 --> 18:59.546
Not what you said in the
truck five minutes ago.

19:01.316 --> 19:04.418
Sweetie. Why don't you give Ty
the bottle of wine we brought.

19:04.452 --> 19:05.719
'Cause I don't have the wine.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.954
It probably still in the truck.

19:07.989 --> 19:13.192
Well... I'll just go down and get it then.

19:13.227 --> 19:14.895
Hmm.

19:21.235 --> 19:22.903
What's that about?

19:25.506 --> 19:28.708
Things have been a little tense
between me and Cass lately.

19:28.743 --> 19:31.645
You wanna tell me what happen?

19:31.679 --> 19:36.315
We had a bit of an
argument on the ride over.

19:36.350 --> 19:39.385
You see I...

19:39.420 --> 19:41.254
I wanted to make a commitment to her...

19:41.288 --> 19:43.856
to be exclusive or whatever.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.824
And I was hoping she wanted the same thing.

19:45.859 --> 19:47.927
Turns out she just wants to be casual.

19:47.961 --> 19:50.329
Well, hey... maybe it's
better if you just, you know...

19:50.364 --> 19:51.697
take things slow.

19:57.937 --> 20:00.605
But if she not feeling it,
then like what are we doing?

20:00.639 --> 20:02.607
Dinner's ready!

20:07.880 --> 20:09.814
I know driving can be a bit scary at first,

20:09.848 --> 20:12.484
but it isn't like you to give up so easily.

20:12.518 --> 20:14.252
I'm not giving up on driving.

20:14.287 --> 20:15.687
I'm just giving up on Tim.

20:15.721 --> 20:18.255
I'm hoping Ty will give me lessons instead.

20:18.290 --> 20:21.358
Okay. But that's not what
you told your grandfather.

20:21.393 --> 20:23.795
You made it sound like you didn't
have time for lessons anymore.

20:23.829 --> 20:25.763
Okay. Well, what am I supposed to say?

20:25.798 --> 20:28.432
That he stresses me out
and confuses me so much

20:28.467 --> 20:30.201
that I never want another lesson again?

20:30.235 --> 20:31.936
There's probably a more
tactful way to putting it,

20:31.971 --> 20:35.438
but yes, I think you
should have been honest.

20:35.473 --> 20:36.464
You know, believe it or not,

20:36.470 --> 20:38.800
he was really looking forward
to teaching you how to drive.

20:38.844 --> 20:41.511
And if he finds out Ty is
giving you lessons instead,

20:41.545 --> 20:44.748
then he might be a bit hurt.

20:44.782 --> 20:47.417
Okay, I'll talk to him.

20:47.451 --> 20:49.720
I think that's a good idea.

20:53.758 --> 20:55.157
Amy, why don't you tell Caleb and Cass

20:55.191 --> 20:57.392
about your new client horse.

20:57.427 --> 20:58.794
Hmm. Her name's Abbey.

21:03.566 --> 21:07.269
I actually jousted once. It's pretty fun.

21:10.073 --> 21:11.406
The whole nine yards.

21:11.441 --> 21:13.208
How did this come about?

21:13.243 --> 21:14.844
Well, I...

21:17.881 --> 21:19.882
She took me to this big festival in Brooks.

21:19.916 --> 21:21.850
Introduced me to all
her jousting friends...

21:21.884 --> 21:23.618
they were really
wonderful people, actually.

21:23.653 --> 21:25.553
Oh, and my horse, Dallas.

21:25.587 --> 21:26.955
Turns out he's a pretty
good jousting horse.

21:26.989 --> 21:28.556
Really?

21:28.590 --> 21:30.992
Well, aren't you full of surprises.

21:31.027 --> 21:33.828
You know, Caleb, you could
really help me out with my client.

21:33.863 --> 21:35.530
Is there anyway you can come by tomorrow?

21:35.564 --> 21:37.032
Yeah, sure.

21:37.066 --> 21:38.833
Okay.

21:38.868 --> 21:42.170
So Caleb, why don't you
tell us a little more

21:42.204 --> 21:43.938
about this medieval wench you dated.

21:45.808 --> 21:49.442
Gwendolyn was no wench. She was all lady.

21:49.477 --> 21:52.046
Well then, maybe you should
look up "lady" Gwendolyn,

21:52.080 --> 21:53.280
and see how she's doing.

21:53.314 --> 21:55.716
Unless of course she's
died of scurvy or small pox

21:55.750 --> 21:57.117
or some other medieval disease.

21:57.152 --> 21:58.886
Well, thankfully she's very much alive.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.654
And maybe I will in the spirit of,

22:00.689 --> 22:04.257
What did you call it,
"keeping things casual."

22:05.660 --> 22:07.728
- Have fun.
- I will.

22:10.765 --> 22:12.599
- Yes... yes of course.
- Dessert?

22:12.633 --> 22:14.702
Thank you.

22:16.037 --> 22:18.305
So how's my little Katie
doing in kindergarten?

22:18.339 --> 22:20.707
Good. She... she really likes her teacher.

22:20.741 --> 22:23.610
And she even made a friend.

22:23.644 --> 22:26.279
- That's great.
- Yeah. His name is Abraham.

22:26.314 --> 22:28.715
It's cute actually, she
calls him her boyfriend.

22:28.749 --> 22:30.250
- Really?
- Uh-ha.

22:30.364 --> 22:32.565
And yesterday she told me
they're getting married.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.734
Katie doesn't waste any time, does she?

22:34.769 --> 22:36.802
Oh no, no. I'm sure this
isn't coming from Katie.

22:36.836 --> 22:38.937
I'm sure this boy is just
using words he's hearing at home

22:38.971 --> 22:40.872
and Katie is following along.

22:40.907 --> 22:42.974
What makes you think
it wasn't Katie's idea?

22:43.009 --> 22:45.243
Well, because I know my daughter and she...

22:45.278 --> 22:47.579
Yeah. Well, she was just at Amy's wedding

22:47.614 --> 22:49.014
so to her getting married means

22:49.048 --> 22:50.816
wearing a pretty dress and eating cupcakes.

22:50.850 --> 22:52.318
Who wouldn't want to get hitched?

22:52.352 --> 22:54.286
I got this.

22:57.823 --> 22:59.324
He's gonna help us out today.

22:59.358 --> 23:00.725
Hey.

23:00.759 --> 23:03.695
Uh, I saw you joust few
years back in Brooks.

23:03.729 --> 23:05.730
- Pretty hardcore stuff.
- Thanks.

23:05.764 --> 23:07.064
I still don't understand
what I'm doing here?

23:07.098 --> 23:08.533
Well, I think I figured
out a way to help both

23:08.567 --> 23:10.301
you and your horse at the same time.

23:10.336 --> 23:12.503
Well, I thought we agreed
to focus on Abbey's recovery.

23:12.538 --> 23:14.204
Yes, but you guys are a team.

23:14.238 --> 23:16.239
Abby needs you just as
much as you need her.

23:16.273 --> 23:18.274
But I'm making her worse.
You said it yourself.

23:18.309 --> 23:20.711
Let's change that.

23:20.745 --> 23:23.313
Okay. What do we do?

23:23.348 --> 23:26.717
Come here. I'm gonna put you on
a nice reliable and quiet horse

23:26.751 --> 23:29.453
- something that'll help build your confidence.
- That is Dallas.

23:29.487 --> 23:31.455
They don't come much more
quiet and reliable than him.

23:31.489 --> 23:33.722
What about Abbey?

23:33.757 --> 23:35.591
Caleb's gonna ride her.
He's a pretty strong rider.

23:35.625 --> 23:36.959
So it'll help build her confidence as well.

23:36.993 --> 23:38.894
What do you mean pretty strong?

23:38.928 --> 23:40.796
Fine. We'll start in the jumping ring

23:40.831 --> 23:42.531
and then we'll go from there.

23:42.566 --> 23:44.433
- Okay. Let's do it.
- Okay.

23:48.805 --> 23:50.506
- Hey Georgie.
- Hi.

23:50.540 --> 23:51.906
Amy tells me you want to go driving.

23:51.940 --> 23:53.541
Yeah, that would be awesome.

23:53.576 --> 23:56.077
Well, I got a few hours
before my shift at the clinic.

23:56.111 --> 23:57.912
You wanna go right now?

23:57.946 --> 24:00.882
- Yeah. All right!
- Let's go.

24:18.299 --> 24:19.800
What? What's wrong? What
are you stopping for?

24:19.834 --> 24:23.003
I don't know. I just... I need a minute.

24:25.573 --> 24:27.240
Is everything okay?

24:36.750 --> 24:38.050
We need to switch places. Now!

24:38.084 --> 24:39.919
- What?
- No. I... just... I'll explain later.

24:39.953 --> 24:41.687
Come on, move over. Let go!

24:43.123 --> 24:44.924
Go! Go! Go!

24:49.797 --> 24:52.064
- Hi.
- Hello Georgie. Ty.

24:52.098 --> 24:54.332
Everything okay?

24:54.366 --> 24:56.034
Uh, yeah. Ty was just giving
me a lift into town. Right, Ty?

24:56.068 --> 24:57.736
Right.

24:59.905 --> 25:01.773
I was just stopping by to see if you'd
changed your mind about driving lessons.

25:01.808 --> 25:03.508
But you obviously have other plans.

25:03.543 --> 25:07.479
So I'll just be on my way.

25:16.789 --> 25:19.424
You want to tell me what's going on?

25:48.313 --> 25:49.779
Aghhh!

25:49.814 --> 25:52.782
Almost, Caleb!

26:05.896 --> 26:07.997
That looked great, Tristan.

26:10.767 --> 26:13.069
I don't think I've thought
about the accident once today.

26:13.103 --> 26:15.071
When I'm on Dallas I can
just be in the moment.

26:15.105 --> 26:16.604
It's a great feeling.

26:16.639 --> 26:18.106
Abbey was really good too.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.108
Are you kidding, she's amazing.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.544
I'm thinking about trading in
my boots for a suit of armour.

26:22.578 --> 26:25.013
Ha ha. You should. I could
use another worthy opponent.

26:25.048 --> 26:26.415
All right. Well, I think
we are done for today.

26:26.449 --> 26:27.815
Same time tomorrow?

26:27.850 --> 26:30.118
- Sounds good.
- See you, Tristan.

26:33.856 --> 26:35.356
Thank you for your help.

26:35.690 --> 26:39.060
Are you kidding? This was fun.

26:39.094 --> 26:41.462
So uh, what are you doing tonight?

26:41.596 --> 26:44.031
I'm not sure, why?

26:44.066 --> 26:45.632
Well, Cass and I were just
talking about how nice it is

26:45.667 --> 26:47.335
to have another couple to hang out with.

26:47.369 --> 26:51.005
And we're thinking we could
all get together. Bowling?

26:51.039 --> 26:53.574
Um... yeah. That'd be fun.

26:53.608 --> 26:55.775
So you guys are... you're okay?

26:55.809 --> 26:58.544
Yeah. We're amazing. Why?

26:58.579 --> 27:00.780
Oh, no reason... I'll talk to Ty.

27:00.814 --> 27:02.782
- Bowling... right? Okay.
- Cool.

27:05.619 --> 27:07.754
I got to pet a salamander today!

27:07.788 --> 27:10.957
- You did?
- It wasn't slimy at all.

27:10.992 --> 27:13.926
That's good. But you washed
your hands afterwards, right?

27:16.963 --> 27:18.931
So did you see your friend Abraham today?

27:18.965 --> 27:20.799
Yup. We got married at recess.

27:20.833 --> 27:23.769
But we got divorced at lunch.

27:30.310 --> 27:34.846
So Caleb invited us to go
out with him and Cass tonight.

27:35.181 --> 27:38.283
No Amy. Not after what happened last night.

27:38.317 --> 27:40.719
I don't want to. I'm so glad you said that.

27:40.753 --> 27:42.587
Don't get me wrong. I like Caleb.

27:42.622 --> 27:45.957
And I don't even mind Cassandra,
but the two of them together...

27:45.991 --> 27:48.460
- It's awkward, I know.
- Yeah.

27:48.494 --> 27:50.929
Besides, I'd rather have
you all to myself tonight.

27:50.963 --> 27:52.664
Maybe we can go see a movie.

27:52.698 --> 27:54.165
We haven't done that in a while.

27:54.199 --> 27:55.599
- Okay.
- Yeah.

27:55.634 --> 27:57.501
You pick the movie. And I'll text Caleb.

27:57.536 --> 27:59.603
Well, what are you gonna say first?

27:59.638 --> 28:03.808
Is it dishonest to say that
we're too tired to go out?

28:04.742 --> 28:07.845
No, it's the truth. We are tired...

28:07.879 --> 28:10.415
tired of Cass and Caleb's drama.

28:12.784 --> 28:14.084
Georgie, give me a hand here, will ya?

28:14.118 --> 28:16.183
- Ah yeah.
- Window? Okay?

28:16.184 --> 28:17.184
Okay.

28:19.891 --> 28:22.993
I'm really sorry about earlier.
I should really explain.

28:23.027 --> 28:24.728
You don't have to. You
weren't fooling anyone.

28:24.763 --> 28:26.396
Ty was giving you a driving lesson.

28:27.833 --> 28:29.667
You're probably better off.

28:29.701 --> 28:32.569
I guess I blamed you for making me nervous.

28:32.603 --> 28:34.004
There you go.

28:34.038 --> 28:35.605
Yeah, well, I have that effect on people.

28:35.639 --> 28:37.441
You don't understand.

28:37.475 --> 28:39.642
I thought it was you that
was making me nervous,

28:39.677 --> 28:41.945
but it had nothing to do with you.

28:41.980 --> 28:44.914
I completely chickened out
with Ty, all over again.

28:44.949 --> 28:46.783
I'm not ready for driving lessons.

28:46.817 --> 28:48.818
Not with you or anybody else.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.620
So that's it? You just quit?

28:50.654 --> 28:52.622
- Well, for now.
- So I don't get it.

28:52.656 --> 28:55.424
One minute you're roman riding in front
of hundreds of people at the rodeo.

28:55.459 --> 28:58.427
Taking on a jump that would make
most kids your age pee their pants,

28:58.462 --> 28:59.729
and you don't even flinch.

28:59.763 --> 29:02.799
And now this... and now you wanna quit.

29:02.833 --> 29:05.001
- That was different.
- Why?

29:05.035 --> 29:06.803
I don't know, it's just different, okay?

29:06.837 --> 29:08.638
- I've gotta get home.
- Hey, how is it going?

29:08.672 --> 29:09.973
I thought I saw your bike outside.

29:10.007 --> 29:13.108
- Hey. I gotta go...
- Georgie wait?

29:13.142 --> 29:14.543
What was that about?

29:14.577 --> 29:15.944
I don't know. Something's wrong.

29:19.448 --> 29:21.383
So... just a heads up.

29:21.417 --> 29:26.622
This move may be zombies and
potentially a giant robot so...

29:26.656 --> 29:28.056
Oh great...

29:28.090 --> 29:29.725
Amy, it was the only one
that was playing right now...

29:34.262 --> 29:37.464
- Oh no. Now what?
- I don't know.

29:37.499 --> 29:38.799
Well, have they've seen us yet?

29:38.834 --> 29:41.468
- I don't think so.
- Maybe we can just...

29:41.503 --> 29:44.705
Ty! Amy!

29:44.740 --> 29:46.407
Hey!

29:46.441 --> 29:49.176
I thought you weren't feeling
up to going out tonight?

29:49.210 --> 29:50.610
Well, we weren't.

29:50.645 --> 29:51.945
Uh, you know, pretty tired.

29:51.979 --> 29:54.113
Yeah, but then we got a second wind.

29:54.148 --> 29:55.415
Oh.

29:55.449 --> 29:58.652
And I was gonna call you,
um, but it was late, you know?

29:58.686 --> 30:00.119
This is great.

30:00.154 --> 30:02.589
I mean, we can all go
to the movie together.

30:02.623 --> 30:03.200
- Yeah.
- Hm-hm.

30:03.225 --> 30:05.224
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Totally.

30:05.259 --> 30:06.760
Okay, well, we better get going

30:06.794 --> 30:08.461
because I hate missing the trailers.

30:08.495 --> 30:11.164
After you.

30:11.198 --> 30:14.100
Come on.

30:30.827 --> 30:34.129
I know what you're gonna say.

30:36.633 --> 30:39.167
Really? I'm that predictable?

30:40.537 --> 30:43.704
Yeah. You're gonna say that I
shouldn't have gone out driving with Ty.

30:43.739 --> 30:47.275
And then you're going to
try to convince me that...

30:47.309 --> 30:51.146
giving up on lessons wasn't
the right thing to do.

30:51.180 --> 30:55.416
Wow, you really do have me figured out.

30:55.451 --> 30:56.851
I don't need to learn to drive.

30:56.885 --> 31:00.321
Horses are way better than cars and trucks.

31:00.356 --> 31:01.822
Okay. I totally agree.

31:01.857 --> 31:04.692
But most people don't use them
exclusively for transportation.

31:04.726 --> 31:06.593
Other than maybe the Amish.

31:09.264 --> 31:11.365
Come on, Georgie...

31:11.399 --> 31:13.701
What's really going on?

31:18.540 --> 31:21.742
It's stupid. You wouldn't understand.

31:23.278 --> 31:25.813
Try me.

31:25.847 --> 31:30.584
Okay. My mom and dad... my birth parents...

31:30.618 --> 31:33.453
That's how they died. In a car crash.

31:33.488 --> 31:36.657
Oh, Georgie... of course.

31:36.691 --> 31:39.393
So I guess whenever I'm driving

31:39.427 --> 31:41.895
I start to think about it.

31:41.929 --> 31:43.897
Yeah. Okay.

31:47.635 --> 31:49.869
Not in the least.

31:49.904 --> 31:54.541
You know, what happened
to your parents it was...

31:55.843 --> 31:58.645
Sometimes bad things happen

31:58.680 --> 32:03.783
and there's just no
way to make sense of it.

32:07.688 --> 32:11.591
Is it okay if I wait until I'm
older to start driving lessons?

32:11.625 --> 32:14.660
Of course. It's totally up to you.

32:16.162 --> 32:18.197
But when you are ready,

32:18.232 --> 32:19.632
your grandpa is gonna be
in the seating right there

32:19.666 --> 32:22.134
in the seat next to you.

32:22.168 --> 32:24.537
Or your dad. Or me.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.654
I'm sorry.

32:42.688 --> 32:43.989
You know, I'm still sick to my stomach.

32:44.023 --> 32:46.058
All that gore and bodily
fluids flying everywhere.

32:46.092 --> 32:48.160
No. I'm not talking about the zombie movie.

32:48.194 --> 32:51.596
I'm talking about Caleb and
Cass making out the entire time.

32:53.666 --> 32:55.267
I just don't get it.

32:55.301 --> 32:57.736
You know, last night all they
did was fight, and tonight...

32:57.771 --> 33:01.373
It was the worst PDA violation
I've seen in a long time.

33:06.812 --> 33:08.712
Well, that is our own fault maybe.

33:08.747 --> 33:11.749
We had them over for dinner.
Now we're a couples friends.

33:23.295 --> 33:26.563
You and me have to break
up with Caleb and Cass.

33:32.536 --> 33:34.871
Nice job, Tristan.

33:37.208 --> 33:39.309
Actually you both do.

33:39.343 --> 33:42.578
Thanks. I wasn't sure
about getting back on Abbey.

33:42.613 --> 33:44.514
But it feels like old times.

33:46.851 --> 33:48.418
What's that?

33:48.452 --> 33:49.919
You need to enter a jousting tournament.

33:49.953 --> 33:51.721
I don't know...

33:51.755 --> 33:53.222
It doesn't have to be a real one.

33:53.256 --> 33:54.624
We can... we can have it at Heartland.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.025
Who would I compete against?

33:56.059 --> 33:58.394
Well, you said yourself, Caleb
would be a worthy opponent.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.938
Hey.

34:09.973 --> 34:11.572
All the experts agree that it
is totally normal for children

34:11.607 --> 34:13.507
to introduce adult terms like "marriage"

34:13.543 --> 34:15.444
into their social interactions.

34:15.478 --> 34:18.080
- Okay.
- It's perfectly normal.

34:19.716 --> 34:23.886
Lou, why are you obsessing about this?

34:23.920 --> 34:27.288
You were right. Katie is
the ringleader. Not Abraham.

34:27.322 --> 34:28.790
What makes you think that?

34:28.824 --> 34:32.293
Because not only did she marry
this boy, she divorced him.

34:32.328 --> 34:33.728
So?

34:33.763 --> 34:35.864
So? Where do you think
she learned that word?

34:35.898 --> 34:39.668
She's five. She was playing
around. Don't take it so hard.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.803
Divorce should not even be
part of her vocabulary, okay?

34:41.838 --> 34:43.605
It makes me feel like a bad parent.

34:43.639 --> 34:46.574
Well, personally, I'm glad
that she divorced Abraham.

34:46.609 --> 34:48.476
'Cause you cannot build a relationship

34:48.510 --> 34:51.179
on mutual love of play dough alone.

34:51.213 --> 34:54.248
You're not helping.

34:54.283 --> 34:56.284
You talk to Georgie?

34:56.318 --> 34:59.053
Yeah. Uh, she's okay.

34:59.088 --> 35:01.289
But I don't think she's
ready for driving lessons.

35:01.323 --> 35:03.057
I wonder if there is
anything in one of these books

35:03.092 --> 35:06.060
about how to help your
children deal with fear.

35:09.731 --> 35:12.733
Hey Cass, listen I just wanted to...

35:14.503 --> 35:16.003
chat with you about some things.

35:16.037 --> 35:18.272
Um, actually, it's about you and Caleb.

35:18.306 --> 35:20.641
Yeah. Well, there's um...

35:20.675 --> 35:23.577
there is actually no me and
Caleb anymore. It's over.

35:23.612 --> 35:27.214
What do you mean? You guys were
all over each other last night.

35:27.248 --> 35:29.349
Uh, yeah. Well um...

35:29.384 --> 35:30.885
after we got home from the movie,

35:30.919 --> 35:33.854
um, Caleb said he didn't want to
just keep things casual anymore.

35:41.295 --> 35:43.830
Hm. I'm sorry. I didn't know.

35:43.864 --> 35:47.066
Yeah. Don't be. It's um, it's for the best.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.702
I mean, we're just really different.

35:49.737 --> 35:53.840
So I don't think it would
have worked anyway. Right?

35:53.874 --> 35:56.709
Yeah. I mean, if you don't
feel the same way about Caleb,

35:56.744 --> 35:58.210
that's probably best that you let him go.

35:58.245 --> 35:59.512
You know... unless...

35:59.547 --> 36:01.648
Unless what?

36:01.682 --> 36:03.482
Like, unless you did have feelings for him,

36:03.516 --> 36:05.183
but you were afraid to give it a try.

36:05.217 --> 36:07.686
Or whatever, you know, but...

36:07.720 --> 36:10.388
But that's not it.

36:10.423 --> 36:14.059
No. I just...

36:14.093 --> 36:16.428
No. This is me. I mean, I don't
know what's wrong. I just...

36:16.463 --> 36:19.665
I don't... I don't cry
over guys, you know, uh...

36:19.699 --> 36:23.836
This isn't who I am. It's really not.

36:23.870 --> 36:25.604
I mean, don't... don't hug me actually I...

36:25.638 --> 36:27.638
- I don't need a hug.
- I wasn't gonna hug you...

36:33.145 --> 36:35.780
Sure.

36:35.814 --> 36:40.751
Uh... Mrs. Ferguson here needs
her horse's teeth floated.

36:40.786 --> 36:44.889
So if you can handle
that, that would be great.

36:44.923 --> 36:46.157
Cass?

36:48.794 --> 36:51.796
I think I made a huge mistake.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.692
Well, don't you look seriously dashing.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.328
- What?
- Is everything all right?

37:11.802 --> 37:13.435
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:13.469 --> 37:14.703
Look, Caleb, if you don't want to do this,

37:14.738 --> 37:16.171
that's totally fine by me.

37:16.205 --> 37:18.707
No. I really wanna do this.

37:18.742 --> 37:20.042
Give me a hand?

37:20.246 --> 37:22.514
Yeah. Of course.

37:26.152 --> 37:28.186
All right.

37:29.187 --> 37:29.997
That's better.

37:32.125 --> 37:34.226
- You're set.
- Thanks.

37:37.162 --> 37:38.563
This is so cool.

37:38.597 --> 37:41.433
Yeah. I just hope I'm
doing the right thing.

37:41.467 --> 37:44.001
Well, what do you mean?

37:44.036 --> 37:47.071
Well, Abbey and Tristan were
injured in a tournament last year.

37:48.507 --> 37:50.542
So I've been working on
building up his confidence.

37:50.576 --> 37:53.277
But at least I hope that it's gonna work.

37:58.250 --> 38:01.953
All right. Okay. Go break a lance.

38:01.987 --> 38:03.487
Will do.

38:20.905 --> 38:26.276
I can't believe he's doing
this? What is he thinking?

38:26.310 --> 38:28.579
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:31.448 --> 38:33.383
Ready!

39:52.260 --> 39:54.027
Caleb!

39:58.227 --> 39:59.640
Oh my god. Caleb!

40:06.200 --> 40:08.702
Are you all right?

40:08.736 --> 40:10.570
What are you doing here?

40:10.604 --> 40:14.874
Why do you think I'm here?

40:14.909 --> 40:16.676
Because I'm your knight in shining armour?

40:18.778 --> 40:20.979
Shut up you silly goof.

40:28.254 --> 40:30.622
Well met, Caleb.

40:32.625 --> 40:34.426
Yeah. Way to kick my butt.

40:35.894 --> 40:38.029
I never thought I'd joust
again. Thank you, Amy.

40:40.065 --> 40:43.201
But you're the one who
made me face my fears.

40:43.235 --> 40:46.037
I'm truly grateful.

40:54.813 --> 40:58.582
I'm ready for a driving lessons.

40:58.617 --> 40:59.983
Are you sure?

41:00.017 --> 41:02.653
No. But I can give it a try.

41:02.687 --> 41:04.455
Do you have any time? Maybe this afternoon?

41:04.489 --> 41:05.956
Yeah. I have time.

41:05.990 --> 41:09.460
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

41:09.494 --> 41:11.462
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:11.496 --> 41:14.064
Bye, honey. Have fun!

41:20.504 --> 41:22.405
Hi. Grab a seat, I'll get you a menu.

41:26.077 --> 41:30.180
I'm Vanessa. We were
in-laws for like half a day.

41:30.214 --> 41:32.816
I'm Abraham's mom.

41:32.850 --> 41:36.518
I just... I wanted to apologize.

41:36.552 --> 41:37.987
I'm going through a separation

41:38.021 --> 41:40.622
and that's why my son
knows the word "divorce".

41:40.657 --> 41:43.058
Yeah. I'm so sorry that your
daughter got caught up in all of this.

41:43.093 --> 41:44.794
No, no, no. Please don't apologize.

41:44.828 --> 41:46.695
I've been blaming myself.

41:46.729 --> 41:49.064
I just separated from my husband as well,

41:49.099 --> 41:51.500
and Katie's just like a
sponge about everything.

41:51.534 --> 41:53.135
You know I have been reading
all of these parenting books

41:53.170 --> 41:55.070
and they all say that it's normal,

41:55.105 --> 41:57.638
but it's hard not to feel guilty
when your son comes home from school

41:57.673 --> 41:59.107
saying he got a divorce.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.174
I know.

42:00.309 --> 42:01.876
Did you read "Two Hearts One Home" yet?

42:01.911 --> 42:04.712
I loved it! I could not put it down.

42:04.746 --> 42:06.881
Hey, did you wanna stay for a coffee?

42:06.916 --> 42:09.884
It's really nice to have someone
to talk to about this stuff.

42:11.620 --> 42:13.188
Do you have anything stronger than coffee?

42:13.222 --> 42:15.456
Yes.

42:15.490 --> 42:17.524
- I can make that happen.
- Okay.

42:20.695 --> 42:23.831
We can just drive around the ranch today.

42:23.865 --> 42:26.066
We don't have to go out on the road.

42:29.470 --> 42:32.039
I just... I need a second.

42:34.075 --> 42:36.575
I have something for you.

42:39.679 --> 42:42.081
It might help.

42:47.888 --> 42:51.357
It's for good luck.

43:34.226 --> 43:35.420
On the next Heartland.

43:35.468 --> 43:37.428
I applied for him to be
a Mounted Police horse.

43:37.432 --> 43:37.869
Separation.

43:37.871 --> 43:39.950
This is his reward, being sent away?

43:39.955 --> 43:41.500
Emotions run high.

43:42.016 --> 43:42.570
Georgie!

43:42.575 --> 43:44.621
You have no idea how this
is going to affect him.

43:44.625 --> 43:44.975
Heartland,

43:46.212 --> 43:48.379
next Sunday at 7:00 on CBC.
