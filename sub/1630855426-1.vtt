WEBVTT

01:08.151 --> 01:09.528
Are you ready?

01:11.989 --> 01:12.990
We're ready.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.869
Ready to forget once and for all.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.537
Good, Mr Lambert.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.790
So then, close your eyes.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.126
Both of you.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.421
Now take a deep breath.

01:28.130 --> 01:32.718
Now feel yourselves getting sleepier
and sleepier.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.847
Neither of you will remember
the last year.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.934
There is no place called The Further.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.439
You will only remember Dalton's coma.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.817
And his recovery.

01:49.860 --> 01:53.697
And let the darkness drift further...

01:54.489 --> 01:57.743
and further away.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.100
For everything, there is a season.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.188
A time to be born...

02:28.023 --> 02:29.191
and a time to die.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.403
A time to kill...

02:35.113 --> 02:36.114
a time to heal.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.159
A time to keep...

02:40.410 --> 02:42.621
and a time to throw away.

02:45.958 --> 02:46.959
A time to weep...

02:47.709 --> 02:49.253
and a time to laugh.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.427
A time to mourn, and a time to dance.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.097
A time for silence...

03:05.936 --> 03:07.312
and a time to speak.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.608
A time for love...

03:12.234 --> 03:13.735
and a time to hate.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.115
A time for war, and a time for peace.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.450
Amen.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.618
Amen.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.587
We therefore commit this body
to the ground.

03:31.670 --> 03:35.048
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

03:35.132 --> 03:36.675
dust to dust.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.051
Amen.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.984
It was a beautiful service
for a beautiful grandma.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.195
She loved you guys so much.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.157
Your mother was a fine friend, Josh.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.074
Thank you.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.285
I miss Grandma.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.329
I know she misses you too, Kali.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.331
Dead people don't miss anything.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.542
Okay, that's not true,
and she does miss you.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.923
See you guys next weekend, okay?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.091
Dalton.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.178
Dalton!

04:24.932 --> 04:27.184
-See what I mean?
-He's just anxious about leaving.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.230
For school next week.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.483
I know. Yeah, no.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.401
Um...

04:38.487 --> 04:41.657
Thank you for organising all this.
I just haven't had the bandwidth.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.412
Why don't you drive him to school?

04:47.496 --> 04:49.581
You have a few weeks
until all your students show up.

04:49.665 --> 04:53.085
-Nah, he wouldn't want me to.
-He's not the parent, you are.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.962
If you don't want to,
then that's a different story, but--

04:55.045 --> 04:55.879
No, I can't.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.258
Why?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.136
Wh--

05:10.018 --> 05:12.062
It was just an idea.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.232
Maybe some way
that you guys could connect, that's all.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.109
He's gonna be gone soon, so...

05:17.192 --> 05:18.610
Anyway, think about it.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.158
Bye. See you, man.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.295
Excuse me.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.884
Excuse me. Hey.

05:44.052 --> 05:44.887
Do I know you?

05:47.264 --> 05:48.640
I knew your mother.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.475
Years ago. Um...

05:51.768 --> 05:53.562
But we lost touch.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.482
What's your name?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.695
Carl.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.871
Nice to meet you, Carl.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.290
Appreciate you coming.
I'm sorry I grabbed you.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.542
-I got a lot on my mind.
-I'm sure.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.128
Death floods the mind with memory.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.715
But there's always new ones
to make, right?

06:23.091 --> 06:24.134
Yeah.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.219
Bye, Josh.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.725
Carl.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.246
Carl.

07:22.943 --> 07:23.777
Uh...

07:49.970 --> 07:53.098
What did you just tell me?
Well, just tell me, Dalton.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.392
Or change it?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.729
Do you wanna clean--?
Do you wanna keep the same diaper on?

07:58.812 --> 07:59.855
Yeah?

07:59.938 --> 08:00.939
I tell you what.

08:01.023 --> 08:05.903
We can just clean out the diaper
and then put the same diaper back on.

08:06.612 --> 08:07.821
Would you like that?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.325
You like that? Okay, I'll do that, then.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.871
What kind of outfit do you want?

08:17.331 --> 08:18.957
Oh... oop.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.377
Oop. What kind of outfit do you want?

08:22.461 --> 08:26.006
Yeah? Well, tell me.
All you got to do is talk to me.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.553
Come on.
It's the greatest guy in the world.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.182
Oh, shit.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.476
Uh...

08:37.558 --> 08:38.559

08:39.394 --> 08:40.395
Yeah, great.

08:58.664 --> 08:59.665

You got, uh, two outlets...

USB port, and, uh, two jumper cables,

Wow.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.251
This is intense.
This what you been working on?

14:36.335 --> 14:38.420
-Put it back.
-No, it's really good.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.089
Did you do this from memory?

14:41.173 --> 14:42.966
It's from a photo I found at the house.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.427
Wow, looks like she's, uh...

14:46.136 --> 14:48.180
Like she's hiding something?

14:48.263 --> 14:49.973
That's what it feels like.

14:51.183 --> 14:53.101
Felt like. The last few years.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.897
She had a tough go, you know,
being a single mom.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.110
Yeah, yeah, that's... Yeah, that's tough.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.081
Guess I didn't make the wall, huh?

15:18.585 --> 15:19.670
I don't blame you.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.298
You know, I'm sorry
I haven't been around lately.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.594
Of course,
my dad wasn't around at all, but...

15:28.720 --> 15:29.930
So it could be a lot worse.

15:31.890 --> 15:35.394
I've just been a little foggy
past few years.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.271
I don't know, my brain just...

15:38.188 --> 15:39.231
I just...

15:40.315 --> 15:43.527
haven't been able to manage a time

15:43.610 --> 15:46.280
for, uh, you and your brother and sister.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.574
Have you ever thought about getting help?

15:51.577 --> 15:53.078
I'm just trying to push through.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.668
-Are you Dalton Lambert?
-Yeah. Are you...?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.170
Chris Winslow.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.844
-Everything cool, fellas?
-Yeah, no, everything's fine.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.471
I just-- I thought
my roommate would be a, um...

16:11.555 --> 16:12.514
Um...

16:12.598 --> 16:13.891
Uh, a guy.

16:13.974 --> 16:14.808
Yeah.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.393
Oh.

16:17.311 --> 16:20.647
I just figured it's a liberal arts school,
and we mean "liberal."

16:20.731 --> 16:23.317
Yeah, probably just confused
by the name "Chris."

16:23.400 --> 16:27.070
Right. 'Cause that would never happen
with a name like "Dalton."

16:27.154 --> 16:29.406
You know, I'm gonna go down
to the housing office

16:29.489 --> 16:30.699
and get this all sorted out.

16:30.782 --> 16:34.745
No, no, no.
Please, father of Dalton. Allow me.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.539
I clearly interrupted some boy bonding.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.208
I'll be back.

16:44.505 --> 16:45.422
Hey. Uh...

16:46.632 --> 16:48.217
I snagged this for you.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.718
You should check it out.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.263
If you hate it, no worries.
But you're not gonna hate it.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.351
You really don't know me, do you?

16:57.434 --> 17:00.062
I mean, you really think
I wanna join a frat?

17:01.146 --> 17:02.981
It's just a party, Dalton.

17:03.774 --> 17:05.358
Go. Have fun.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.402
I mean, do it for me. I drove you here.

17:07.486 --> 17:09.404
-You didn't even want to.
-Of course I did.

17:09.488 --> 17:10.781
Stop lying to me!

17:12.199 --> 17:14.409
I heard what Mom said at the funeral.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.078
Well, I still did it.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.121
Oh, so that makes you
father of the year now?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.498
At least you've got a father.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.500
Stop blaming your dad
for shit you screwed up.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.461
He left like 40 years ago. Get over it.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.463
God knows I'm not gonna be defined by you.

17:26.547 --> 17:29.132
Are you kidding me?
After all we have done for you?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.718
When did you become
this ungrateful, little shit?

17:35.013 --> 17:36.390
No wonder Mom divorced you.

17:37.516 --> 17:38.976
Thanks for the ride.

19:30.838 --> 19:32.673
You can tell it's Shania Twain, right?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.174
Yeah.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.427
So, what'd they say at housing?

19:37.511 --> 19:38.887
They said, "Tough titties."

19:38.971 --> 19:40.681
I got to sleep here tonight.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.725
But I'll get a new room tomorrow,
so it's not a permanent thing.

19:43.809 --> 19:45.102
Heartbreak, right?

19:46.687 --> 19:49.648
-You're in the art school, I take it?
-Yeah. Are you music?

19:49.731 --> 19:51.400
Math. I thought about music,

19:51.483 --> 19:53.735
but the artist's life
is one of nomadic instability

19:53.819 --> 19:55.195
and much gnashing of teeth.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.116
But I'm sure you'll be super successful.

20:00.993 --> 20:03.328
-You wanna blow my hooter?
-What?

20:03.912 --> 20:04.955
Do you play?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.373
Oh.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.710
-Uh, just a little piano.
-It's the same thing. Just blow.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.424
My cooties are good cooties.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.771
What's that?

20:29.855 --> 20:31.857
It's just something my mom wrote.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.192
Sweet.

20:35.068 --> 20:35.903
So...

20:37.154 --> 20:38.572
what's some weird shit about you?

20:41.867 --> 20:42.951
I don't know.

20:43.035 --> 20:45.662
Uh... "I don't know."

20:46.580 --> 20:48.123
Come on, man. Everybody's weird.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.125
You first.

20:50.209 --> 20:53.337
On Sundays, I wear a monocle
and I order takeout with a British accent.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.922
That is weird.

20:55.005 --> 20:56.340
Thank you.

20:56.423 --> 21:00.135
Okay, sometimes I eat instant oatmeal,

21:00.219 --> 21:03.347
uh, with no, like,
water or milk or anything.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.599
It's just kind of dry.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.809
You're bad at this.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.228
Let's try again.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.230
When I was 10, my parents died,

21:11.313 --> 21:13.023
and I went to go live
with my Grandma Perkee,

21:13.106 --> 21:16.818
who once went almost nearly blind
from a gnarly case of athlete's foot.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.156
I don't remember when I was 10.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.243
Like, the whole year.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.410
What do you mean?

21:27.079 --> 21:28.497
I was in a coma.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.290
Viral meningitis.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.834
At least that's what they told me,

21:31.917 --> 21:34.169
the few times
that they would talk about it.

21:34.253 --> 21:37.673
But I don't remember anything.

21:37.756 --> 21:39.466
I don't even remember being sick.

21:39.550 --> 21:43.887
It's like I woke up one day
and a whole year had passed.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.515
That's awful.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.101
And pretty weird.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.144
Well done.

21:51.228 --> 21:54.398
Yeah, honestly, I wish I could have
forgotten a whole year when I was a kid.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.818
Could've used a little "meningi-gi."

22:00.654 --> 22:06.118
Uh... you know,
there is one more weird thing about me.

22:06.201 --> 22:12.249
Um, ever since my coma,
I've been afraid of the dark.

22:12.332 --> 22:16.086
I was afraid of Barbie dolls
till I was, like... now.

22:17.171 --> 22:18.881
There's nothing wrong with being scared.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.717
Just as long as you don't keep me up
with some bright-ass night light.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.343
Um...

22:26.805 --> 22:28.432
-Seriously?
-Sorry.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.267
Oh, man. Whatever.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.603
It's fine. I'll deal.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.203
Hey, this is Dalton.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.662
I can't get to the phone right now,

22:50.746 --> 22:52.831
so leave me a message
and I'll give you a call back.

22:52.915 --> 22:55.042
Hey, bud. It's me.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.503
Just making sure
you're getting settled in okay.

22:57.586 --> 22:58.587
Um...

22:59.963 --> 23:03.717
I was just, uh,
thinking about what you said...

23:04.885 --> 23:06.053
and, um...

23:08.180 --> 23:13.519
I don't know. I don't know
what's going on with me, but, um...

23:15.562 --> 23:16.855
I'm gonna find out.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.485
And I just wanted you to know that.

23:25.781 --> 23:26.865
Okay, bye.

23:54.017 --> 23:54.852
Hello.

23:54.935 --> 23:57.104
I am Professor Armagan.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.606
Shut off your phones.

23:59.690 --> 24:02.025
Open your portfolios.

24:02.109 --> 24:04.695
Pull out something that will interest me.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.116
Pin it to your easel.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.493
Stand beside your work.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.495
Stand proud.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.006
Alec Anderson.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.300
Your technique is obvious.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.802
-It looks like a photograph.
-Thanks.

24:28.886 --> 24:30.804
That wasn't a compliment.

24:32.890 --> 24:34.224
Tear it up.

24:34.308 --> 24:35.350
Excuse me?

24:35.434 --> 24:37.394
The drawing. Tear it up.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.731
I worked my ass off on this piece.

24:40.814 --> 24:42.441
No one will miss it.

24:44.860 --> 24:45.861
No way.

24:46.862 --> 24:50.157
Alas, our first casualty.

24:50.240 --> 24:54.661
Usually, I go through introductions
before someone quits.

24:54.745 --> 24:56.997
-I didn't quit.
-Yes, you did.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.584
You just haven't realised it yet.
You can go.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.721
Good luck.

25:15.307 --> 25:18.477
Any fool can learn technique.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.978
Even master it.

25:20.812 --> 25:24.858
It doesn't mean anything
if it doesn't come from inside.

25:25.734 --> 25:29.988
I am not interested in the "rules of art."

25:30.072 --> 25:32.324
We are going to break the rules.

25:34.076 --> 25:36.537
Then I want you to break them again.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.539
See how broken you can get.

25:47.840 --> 25:48.924
Dalton Lambert.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.425
Yes, ma'am?

25:50.509 --> 25:54.638
Why in the hell would you destroy
a beautiful drawing like that?

26:01.728 --> 26:03.689
Once more for good measure?

26:07.150 --> 26:08.777
Wasn't so hard, was it?

26:11.655 --> 26:14.741
Good. You must let go of your past.

26:15.325 --> 26:17.953
Shed your skin in order to grow.

26:18.036 --> 26:20.247
I'll count backwards from ten.

26:20.330 --> 26:21.999
With each number,

26:22.082 --> 26:27.796
I want you to sink
further and further into yourself.

26:28.839 --> 26:31.633
Do not lift the charcoal from the paper.

26:32.843 --> 26:33.677
Ten...

26:34.261 --> 26:35.721
nine...

26:36.555 --> 26:41.143
eight, seven, six...

26:41.852 --> 26:43.061
five...

26:43.729 --> 26:48.567
four, three, two...

26:49.776 --> 26:50.777
one.

26:53.405 --> 26:56.325
Draw whatever your soul brings forth.

26:56.408 --> 26:58.827
An experience that defines you.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.749
You've got to be willing to dredge up

27:03.832 --> 27:06.543
your ugliest, innermost thoughts.

28:31.879 --> 28:34.256
Is it keeping you in or out?

28:43.724 --> 28:45.559
You'll have headphones on.

28:45.642 --> 28:49.688
The machine is quite loud,
but you'll be able to hear me.

28:50.272 --> 28:54.943
I'm going to need you to stay as still
as possible throughout the procedure.

28:55.652 --> 28:57.738
If you feel like you need
to get out of there,

28:57.821 --> 29:00.490
give the call ball a squeeze,
we'll give you a break.

29:01.408 --> 29:02.409
You good?

29:03.160 --> 29:04.161
Overjoyed.

29:04.953 --> 29:05.787
All aboard.

29:19.343 --> 29:21.470
Hit this.

29:36.235 --> 29:38.529
Okay. You comfortable, Josh?

29:39.154 --> 29:41.698
Yep. Let's just get this over with.

30:19.194 --> 30:20.028
Hello?

30:23.365 --> 30:24.741
Dr Brower?

30:29.162 --> 30:30.247
Dr Brower?

30:32.958 --> 30:35.127
There's someone with you.

30:35.210 --> 30:37.546
What? What did you say?

30:39.631 --> 30:41.133
Dr Brower, what did you say?

30:48.682 --> 30:49.516
Wh--

30:52.853 --> 30:53.854
Come on.

30:55.772 --> 30:56.607
Um...

30:57.441 --> 30:58.942
Okay, can you let me out, please?

31:00.277 --> 31:02.779
Hello, hey!

31:03.906 --> 31:05.449
Can you let me out?

31:06.825 --> 31:08.285
The door is open.

31:09.411 --> 31:13.040
Okay, okay. Let me out. Let me out.
Hey! Dr Brower.

31:13.123 --> 31:14.499
Dr Brower, let me out.

31:14.583 --> 31:16.335
Come on. Get me out of here.

31:16.418 --> 31:18.712
Hello? Hey!

31:24.051 --> 31:27.179
Just let me out.
Let me out, let me out, let me out.

31:28.305 --> 31:30.766
Dr Brower. Come on.

31:33.644 --> 31:34.728
Let me out.

32:00.587 --> 32:01.672
Okay. Come on.

32:06.176 --> 32:07.010
Mr Lambert?

32:07.094 --> 32:08.512
-What was that? What was that?
-Are you okay?

32:08.595 --> 32:11.181
-Who was that? Why did the lights go out?
-Calm down.

32:11.265 --> 32:13.183
You said the lights went out?

32:13.267 --> 32:15.811
All the lights went out
and I got stuck in there, man.

32:15.894 --> 32:16.895
And I saw...

32:21.608 --> 32:22.985
-What...
-Mr Lambert,

32:23.068 --> 32:25.362
you've been asleep for 15 minutes.

32:25.445 --> 32:29.157
You went right out.
Your MRI went perfectly.

32:34.204 --> 32:36.540
-What?
-Take your time to get dressed.

32:36.623 --> 32:37.624
Come on through.

32:49.928 --> 32:51.889
There's nothing physically wrong with you.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.349
No growths or spots on the brain.

32:54.892 --> 32:56.143
Nothing to be concerned about.

33:00.731 --> 33:03.734
That's good news, Mr Lambert.

33:04.526 --> 33:06.820
Yeah, no, I know, I, uh...

33:09.239 --> 33:11.200
I guess I was just hoping
for something real.

33:12.618 --> 33:15.913
Something that could explain this fog.

33:15.996 --> 33:17.664
The memory issues you're talking about,

33:17.748 --> 33:19.833
they could be spurred on
by a number of things.

33:19.917 --> 33:23.462
Increased stress, change in daily habits.

33:23.545 --> 33:26.548
Have there been any disruptions
in your home life?

33:28.717 --> 33:31.303
My, uh, mom passed away recently.

33:31.803 --> 33:33.597
I'm sorry for your loss.

33:35.766 --> 33:37.768
Not to mention my son left for school,

33:37.851 --> 33:41.772
and, uh, my ex-wife
hardly talks to me, so...

33:42.481 --> 33:44.608
-That certainly sounds stressful.
-Yeah.

33:44.691 --> 33:47.402
Maybe a grief counsellor be of some help?

33:49.321 --> 33:51.031
Yeah. Sure. Probably would.

33:53.534 --> 33:56.870
Do you have any history
of mental illness in your family?

33:58.539 --> 33:59.706
Mental illness?

33:59.790 --> 34:01.333
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.669
It can be informative
as we try to make a diagnosis.

34:03.752 --> 34:05.003
Not that I'm aware of.

34:05.087 --> 34:06.338
It's worth looking into.

34:07.631 --> 34:09.091
Meanwhile, there are exercises,

34:09.174 --> 34:11.134
games you can do
to stimulate your memory.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.637
Matching games. Like kids do.

34:14.263 --> 34:16.181
You want me to play kids' games?

34:16.806 --> 34:18.600
We can learn a lot from kids.

34:22.020 --> 34:22.896
Yeah.

34:26.900 --> 34:27.943
Thanks.

37:53.857 --> 37:54.900
Whatcha doin'?

38:00.197 --> 38:02.032
Got my new room assignment today.

38:02.115 --> 38:04.576
So, alas, no more panty parties.

38:04.660 --> 38:07.246
But consolation, I'm in 323 now.

38:07.329 --> 38:08.705
Right above you.

38:08.789 --> 38:09.998
So be cautious, young man,

38:10.082 --> 38:12.543
lest I hear you slap your sausage
in the dead of night.

38:19.383 --> 38:21.468
-You want to join a frat?
-What?

38:22.177 --> 38:23.053
Oh.

38:23.136 --> 38:24.763
No, it's just something my dad got me.

38:26.223 --> 38:27.432
We should go.

38:28.058 --> 38:30.352
We can make fun of their khaki pants
and trust funds.

38:30.894 --> 38:32.563
Unless you're not done redecorating.

38:34.231 --> 38:36.733
Come on, Dolphin.
Do something nice for your old man.

38:36.817 --> 38:38.902
What's the worst that could happen?

38:44.032 --> 38:45.868
May I offer you some diaper pudding?

38:45.951 --> 38:47.578
Uh, I'm good.

38:48.579 --> 38:49.955
Oh, no.

38:50.038 --> 38:51.039
Whatever.

38:51.707 --> 38:52.958
Seriously?

38:53.041 --> 38:55.919
Oh, come on.
Quit your bitching and come here.

38:56.003 --> 38:59.631
To memorialize the night
that Dalton Lambert actually has fun!

39:03.969 --> 39:07.681
Go! Go! Go!

39:21.069 --> 39:22.571
What's "frat juice"?

39:23.238 --> 39:24.781
-Don't ask.
-Hey, hey, hey!

39:24.865 --> 39:26.742
Everyone, my name's Nick.

39:26.825 --> 39:32.539
Nick the Dick!
Nick the Dick! Nick the Dick!

39:32.623 --> 39:35.626
Welcome to the Kappa House,
and welcome back to school, baby.

39:36.710 --> 39:42.257
I'm just here
to remind you fine folks that frats,

39:42.341 --> 39:43.592
they're under attack.

39:44.218 --> 39:47.721
Right, and we must protect
our right to party

39:47.804 --> 39:49.389
and to be awesome.

39:49.473 --> 39:53.268
White, Black, brown, or blue,
you're all welcome at JPU,

39:53.352 --> 39:56.605
provided that you recognise

39:56.688 --> 39:58.273
and respect

39:58.357 --> 40:01.610
that the frat house is the last house

40:01.693 --> 40:03.570
where men can still be men.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.535
Whoo!

40:10.035 --> 40:11.245
Thank you.

40:11.912 --> 40:14.248
Now, we got a lot of drinking
to do tonight,

40:14.331 --> 40:16.416
but pace yourselves.

40:17.251 --> 40:19.294
We do not need another incident.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.463
This party's lame.

40:21.547 --> 40:24.466
Confirmed. So let's go upstairs
and look through everyone's shit.

41:11.847 --> 41:13.974
Huh. Oh. Wow.

41:18.562 --> 41:19.938
Oh, no.

41:20.564 --> 41:21.690
This is Nick's room.

41:21.773 --> 41:23.567
And this is Nick's butthole cream.

41:23.650 --> 41:26.904

I just need some supplies.

to get the hammer drop.

45:13.338 --> 45:14.673
What the hell?

45:15.549 --> 45:18.385
Oh, my God. So sorry.

45:19.011 --> 45:22.848
We were just looking for some privacy,
you know?

45:22.931 --> 45:24.224
We were gonna do it.

45:26.435 --> 45:27.936
I'd rather watch my parents do it.

45:29.062 --> 45:31.356
But you should stick around.

45:31.440 --> 45:33.775
We might get drunk enough
to find you attractive.

45:35.235 --> 45:36.904
Even though you look like a clown.

45:38.197 --> 45:40.324
Nick the Dick, huh?

45:41.074 --> 45:42.910
I'm more partial to kick the dick.

45:43.452 --> 45:44.494
Oh!

45:44.578 --> 45:45.704
Run!

45:51.418 --> 45:53.545
That was pretty quick thinking
back there, right?

45:53.629 --> 45:54.630
I, uh...

45:55.506 --> 45:56.924
Oh, crap.

45:57.007 --> 45:59.051
I should've asked
before I kissed you, right?

45:59.134 --> 46:01.595
I am sorry. I was just...
I was going on instinct.

46:01.678 --> 46:03.514
-Oh, no...
-Are you okay?

46:03.597 --> 46:05.098
I'm fine. It's just, I, um...

46:11.480 --> 46:14.816
I'm just sorry for what he said to you.

46:15.567 --> 46:16.401
Oh.

46:16.944 --> 46:17.945
Whatever.

46:18.862 --> 46:20.948
You think I care
what Vineyard Vines thinks?

46:21.031 --> 46:22.366
He should be so lucky.

46:23.283 --> 46:26.245
Hey, buddy, it is, uh, me again.

46:26.328 --> 46:28.622
Um, I went to the doctor.

46:28.705 --> 46:31.083
Um, and everything's okay.

46:32.251 --> 46:34.878
Well, not okay.
But I'm getting to the bottom of it.

46:34.962 --> 46:37.297
So, uh, just give me a call when you can.

46:37.381 --> 46:39.883
All right, I, uh...

46:40.551 --> 46:43.428
I'm really sorry, Dalton,
about what I said the other day.

46:45.597 --> 46:46.640
All right, bye.

49:55.329 --> 49:57.247
Where's my mayonnaise?

50:01.043 --> 50:02.044
Who is it?

51:07.484 --> 51:09.528
Please don't tell me
you're really just a creep.

51:09.611 --> 51:11.196
What? No.

51:11.280 --> 51:12.823
Then what the hell is going on?

51:15.033 --> 51:16.159
Come on in.

51:26.795 --> 51:30.340
Something's happening to me.
I'm seeing things, crazy things.

51:30.424 --> 51:34.803
You know that kid at the frat house
that they talked about, with the incident?

51:34.887 --> 51:37.306
-Uh-huh.
-I saw him. And he was dead.

51:39.141 --> 51:41.143
It started with an art exercise,

51:41.226 --> 51:46.398
and she asked us to dig deep
into a memory, into our subconscious.

51:46.481 --> 51:49.526
So I did and I drew this door.

51:49.610 --> 51:51.278
You really need to lay off the frat juice.

51:51.361 --> 51:52.362
I'm serious.

51:53.822 --> 51:57.117
Tonight, I was painting and I fell asleep.

51:57.201 --> 51:59.912
And when I woke up, this lantern appeared.

51:59.995 --> 52:02.206
It was like a dream,
but it wasn't a dream.

52:02.289 --> 52:05.459
And then I walked to your room.

52:06.793 --> 52:09.129
I know how this sounds.

52:23.894 --> 52:26.730
I feel like
I'm getting closer to something.

52:27.814 --> 52:29.816
Or something's getting closer to me.

52:35.822 --> 52:37.115
You got an extra pillow?

54:29.394 --> 54:30.395
Okay.

54:31.480 --> 54:32.564
Foster.

54:33.815 --> 54:34.900
Renai.

54:37.361 --> 54:38.362
Dalton.

54:41.031 --> 54:42.032
Kali.

54:45.077 --> 54:46.078
Dalton.

54:48.539 --> 54:49.540
Dalton?

54:50.999 --> 54:52.000
Dalton.

54:58.340 --> 54:59.174
Mom.

55:28.078 --> 55:29.079
Okay.

55:31.373 --> 55:32.916
Okay, Mom, help me out.

55:37.421 --> 55:38.255
Kali.

55:39.506 --> 55:41.466
Dalton. Dalton.

55:42.885 --> 55:43.886
Mom.

55:46.471 --> 55:47.306
Mom?

55:49.016 --> 55:50.017
Mom.

55:51.435 --> 55:53.604
I don't know. I don't know.

56:28.305 --> 56:29.306
Okay.

56:56.959 --> 56:57.793
Damn it.

58:00.397 --> 58:01.690
Chiaroscuro.

58:03.984 --> 58:05.986
The dance of light and shadow.

58:07.613 --> 58:12.034
An effect used not only
to create volume and definition,

58:12.117 --> 58:16.038
but also a specific, unseen light source.

58:17.623 --> 58:20.667
Right. This is one of Goya's best.

58:21.668 --> 58:25.005
The negative space draws our eyes
towards Saturn.

58:25.589 --> 58:29.760
Does it represent darkness or some void?

58:30.928 --> 58:32.763
Goya mastered it on the canvas,

58:32.846 --> 58:39.144
but family problems and health issues
sent this once-revered court painter

58:39.228 --> 58:41.146
into a dark spiral,

58:41.230 --> 58:44.274
leading him to create this grisly portrait

58:44.358 --> 58:47.236
of a father devouring his son.

58:51.240 --> 58:55.619
This balance between light and dark
is what we're after.

58:56.328 --> 58:57.329
Get ready.

59:01.124 --> 59:06.797
Your own experiences shape your artwork.
Embrace them. Use them.

59:07.297 --> 59:11.385
Sink deep into the darkness of memory.

59:12.219 --> 59:13.387
Ten...

59:14.304 --> 59:15.305
nine...

59:16.181 --> 59:17.182
eight...

59:17.891 --> 59:18.892
seven...

59:19.685 --> 59:20.686
six...

59:21.353 --> 59:22.479
five...

59:22.980 --> 59:23.981
four...

59:24.606 --> 59:25.607
three...

59:26.400 --> 59:27.401
two...

59:28.068 --> 59:29.069
one...

01:00:22.581 --> 01:00:24.541
-'Sup, nerd?
-A red door.

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:25.876
Uh, a purple pecker.

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:28.504
Come on, man. Doesn't that
mean anything to you? A red door?

01:00:28.587 --> 01:00:30.380
You sound weirder than usual.

01:00:31.048 --> 01:00:33.425
It's a thing from art class.
It's a painting.

01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:35.802
We had to find a memory.

01:00:36.595 --> 01:00:38.180
I thought it was something
from our childhood.

01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:39.097
Did you ask Mom?

01:00:39.765 --> 01:00:41.600
No, I don't want to worry her.

01:00:41.683 --> 01:00:42.851
Why would that worry her?

01:00:45.896 --> 01:00:48.482
-I don't know.
-This what happens when you go to college?

01:00:48.565 --> 01:00:49.816
You get all cryptic and shit?

01:00:50.943 --> 01:00:51.944
I guess.

01:00:52.027 --> 01:00:53.195
Well, I'm not going, then.

01:01:20.722 --> 01:01:24.017
So after the whole spooky
dream-not-a-dream thing the other night,

01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:25.435
I started thinking:

01:01:25.519 --> 01:01:29.231
"Yeah, okay, Dalton's a weirdo,
but he's not insane, right?"

01:01:29.314 --> 01:01:30.732
I'm gonna need that key back.

01:01:30.816 --> 01:01:34.611
Right. So I started poking
around the old interwebs...

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:36.655
and guess what?

01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:38.991
You're not crazy at all.

01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:42.077
You are an astral projector.

01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:44.037
Check this out.

01:01:44.705 --> 01:01:47.165
Looks like they filmed it
in between shifts at Best Buy.

01:01:47.249 --> 01:01:51.170
Hey, guys, this is Spectral Sightings.
I'm Specs, this is Tucker. Say hi, Tucker.

01:01:51.253 --> 01:01:53.672
-No.
-Okay. We are PPI,

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:56.466
Professional Paranormal Investigators.

01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:58.677
Today, we're gonna be talking about
something that dozens of you

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.512
have been asking us about.

01:02:00.596 --> 01:02:02.514
-Astral projection.
-Astral projection.

01:02:02.598 --> 01:02:03.849
It's a real phenomenon.

01:02:03.932 --> 01:02:05.726
Our physical body falls asleep

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:09.897
and our astral body leaves
that physical body...

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.941
and floats off into another realm.

01:02:13.025 --> 01:02:15.903
-That's exactly what it feels like.
-See, I told you. It's cool, right?

01:02:15.986 --> 01:02:18.530
Our former mentor, Dr Elise Rainier,

01:02:18.614 --> 01:02:20.824
she had a name for this other realm.

01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:23.368
-She called it The Further.
-Hold on.

01:02:28.999 --> 01:02:30.959
I am Elise.

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:32.753
It's nice to see you all.

01:02:33.462 --> 01:02:37.758
So I'm here to talk to you
about astral projection...

01:02:38.759 --> 01:02:40.802
and The Further.

01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:42.095
Okay...

01:02:43.472 --> 01:02:44.806
give me a minute here.

01:02:45.933 --> 01:02:46.934
Three...

01:02:47.976 --> 01:02:48.977
two...

01:02:50.729 --> 01:02:51.730
one.

01:02:53.774 --> 01:02:54.775
The Further...

01:02:56.652 --> 01:02:58.570
is a dark realm...

01:02:59.154 --> 01:03:01.573
filled with tortured souls of the dead...

01:03:02.658 --> 01:03:06.370
and some are doomed...

01:03:07.704 --> 01:03:10.123
to live the worst mistakes of their lives

01:03:10.207 --> 01:03:13.001
over and over and over for all eternity.

01:03:14.253 --> 01:03:15.879
When you astral project...

01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:18.298
or you travel to this realm...

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.551
these are the souls...

01:03:21.301 --> 01:03:23.220
that you awaken with your presence.

01:03:23.846 --> 01:03:25.264
They can smell you.

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:28.725
The presence of life.

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:32.187
Life is what they crave,

01:03:32.271 --> 01:03:33.897
more than anything.

01:03:33.981 --> 01:03:36.567
So the further you travel...

01:03:38.652 --> 01:03:40.696
the riskier the journey becomes.

01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:45.617
They want life, and they can come
to our world to get it.

01:03:46.827 --> 01:03:49.037
Keep a steady stride.

01:03:55.335 --> 01:03:58.130
I see those gears turning.
What is it?

01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:02.342
-That kid from the frat house?
-The pukey kid?

01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:04.553
Yeah. He said something to me.

01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:07.556
He said, "Close the door."

01:04:07.639 --> 01:04:09.808
I'm sure he did.
It probably wasn't his proudest moment.

01:04:10.475 --> 01:04:14.229
Yeah, but what if
he meant something else?

01:04:14.313 --> 01:04:15.981
What if he was talking about this door?

01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:19.067
So, what? You want to go back and ask him?

01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:22.863
Seriously?

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.198
I need to know.

01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:26.533
Look, I feel bad for the dude, I do,

01:04:26.617 --> 01:04:30.787
but dark realms are typically
places I try to avoid.

01:04:31.455 --> 01:04:34.917
There's something important

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.418
about this painting, Chris.

01:04:38.545 --> 01:04:40.005
I have to find out.

01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:42.090
Okay.

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:47.804
It's not like Nick the Dick is just gonna
let you waltz into his bedroom

01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:49.515
and chat with the ghost in his toilet.

01:04:50.766 --> 01:04:51.850
He'll never know I'm there.

01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:06.365
So, what's the plan?

01:05:06.448 --> 01:05:07.950
-I got this.
-Can I help you?

01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:13.121
Hello.

01:05:13.205 --> 01:05:16.583
I have left my brassiere
in Nicholas's room,

01:05:16.667 --> 01:05:19.002
and I was wondering
if he is perchance home?

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.798
I think he's upstairs studying with Paige.

01:05:24.758 --> 01:05:26.385
Great job, Dolphin.

01:05:27.678 --> 01:05:31.098
I'm gonna read you this.
It's called In Flames.

01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:34.893
Very vulnerable piece.
"Looking across a campfire..."

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.441
I need a room with darkness.

01:05:41.525 --> 01:05:42.526
Okay.

01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:47.197
Then what?

01:05:47.739 --> 01:05:51.660
You gonna float through the air
and do a little "Ooh"?

01:05:53.161 --> 01:05:54.288
I'm not like a ghost.

01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.915
And you never will be
with that attitude, Casper.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:05:59.877
Bingo.

01:06:05.007 --> 01:06:07.217
What are the chances
those bedsheets are crusty?

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:09.219
Probably snap like a taco shell.

01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:11.096
I'll take the dirty floor.

01:06:16.476 --> 01:06:17.686
Okay...

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:28.405
-Can you give me a little space, please?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

01:06:37.998 --> 01:06:38.999
Okay, you ready?

01:06:42.711 --> 01:06:45.214
Ten, nine...

01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:48.175
eight, seven...

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:51.637
six, five...

01:06:52.888 --> 01:06:55.432
four, three...

01:06:56.433 --> 01:06:59.311
two, one.

01:07:13.575 --> 01:07:14.826
Are you floating yet?

01:07:27.256 --> 01:07:28.632
Farewell, traveller.

01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:41.520
You out here, Dalton?

01:08:05.544 --> 01:08:07.546
...creative writing double major.

01:08:08.463 --> 01:08:12.885
But I'm also crazy good at finance,
so I don't want to waste that gift.

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:15.596
How long do you have to keep that on?

01:08:16.721 --> 01:08:17.555
Oh.

01:08:18.807 --> 01:08:19.808
Yeah, it's good now.

01:08:21.518 --> 01:08:22.810
My pores are good.

01:08:43.122 --> 01:08:44.124
Oh.

01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:01.683
I'm gonna be a while.

01:09:02.392 --> 01:09:03.685
Gross.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.033
Dalton?

01:09:21.453 --> 01:09:22.578
Dalton.

01:09:25.832 --> 01:09:27.626
Someone turn on the lights!

01:09:34.716 --> 01:09:35.551
Dalton.

01:09:36.218 --> 01:09:37.219
Dalton.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.139
Dalton, wake up.

01:09:41.223 --> 01:09:42.265
-Guys! Seriously.
-Chris.

01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:44.560
Guys, who's messing with me?

01:09:44.643 --> 01:09:46.060
Close the door!

01:09:46.603 --> 01:09:48.063
Close the door!

01:09:49.606 --> 01:09:50.439
Dalton?

01:10:00.868 --> 01:10:02.244
-Close the door!
-Chris!

01:10:20.053 --> 01:10:20.888
Oh, God.

01:10:29.104 --> 01:10:30.105
Come on!

01:10:37.988 --> 01:10:38.989
Chris.

01:10:40.657 --> 01:10:41.783
What...?

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:07.518
Come on.

01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:33.085
What?

01:11:58.569 --> 01:11:59.570
Chris.

01:12:00.779 --> 01:12:02.489
-Chris. Hey. I didn't mean it like that...
-Don't.

01:12:05.284 --> 01:12:06.994
I just wanted to see if you're okay.

01:12:07.077 --> 01:12:08.245
I'm okay.

01:12:09.288 --> 01:12:13.000
I'm sorry. I didn't know
anyone could get hurt in the real world.

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:15.002
Well, they can.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.047
You have no idea what you're messing with.

01:12:20.174 --> 01:12:22.217
I can't be a part of this, Dalton.

01:12:22.759 --> 01:12:25.470
And neither should you.
Because next time, you might not wake up.

01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:52.456
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:12:52.539 --> 01:12:55.542
Uh, it's not your weekend.
Kali's at a sleepover and Foster's...

01:12:55.626 --> 01:12:57.211
I'm not here for the kids.

01:12:58.545 --> 01:12:59.379
Can we talk?

01:13:00.839 --> 01:13:01.840
Sure.

01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:11.975
Wow, two calls in one week.

01:13:12.059 --> 01:13:14.311
-Come on, man.
-Haven't you made any friends yet?

01:13:16.188 --> 01:13:18.774
Tell me everything you remember
about my coma.

01:13:21.485 --> 01:13:22.569
You should talk to Mom.

01:13:22.653 --> 01:13:24.029
I think these...

01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:27.533
-things I'm drawing, they...
-The door?

01:13:27.616 --> 01:13:29.868
And now a guy with a hammer.

01:13:31.954 --> 01:13:36.208
-A hammer?
-I think they could be clues from my past,

01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:38.585
thoughts that have disappeared
'cause of my coma.

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:42.256
-I don't know why they're coming out now--
-Wait. Dalton.

01:13:44.424 --> 01:13:45.425
What is it?

01:13:46.552 --> 01:13:48.554
I've had this image in my mind for years.

01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:53.559
Mom always says it's not real.
It's just a bad dream. But...

01:13:53.642 --> 01:13:56.353
Tell me, little brother. Come on.

01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:03.735
Okay. We're in a room somewhere.
Like a basement.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.321
You remember that?

01:14:10.909 --> 01:14:11.952
Dalton, you there?

01:15:22.397 --> 01:15:24.942
All I ever wanted
was to be better than my father.

01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:28.737
You know that. Just to be a good dad.

01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:31.490
You were. You are, Josh.

01:15:31.573 --> 01:15:33.033
Well, Dalton would disagree.

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:37.037
Well, if it's any consolation,
I can't even get him to call me back.

01:15:40.832 --> 01:15:43.043
My dad abandoned his family, and...

01:15:43.752 --> 01:15:45.170
I've done the same thing.

01:15:45.254 --> 01:15:46.547
No, you haven't.

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:50.133
You're not him, Josh,
and you're allowed to be angry at him.

01:15:50.217 --> 01:15:52.302
I am angry.
I've been angry for a long time.

01:15:52.386 --> 01:15:54.137
Angry at a man that I have never met.

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:59.685
Angry at a man that jumped off the roof
of a mental hospital in 1978.

01:16:02.604 --> 01:16:05.774
For more than 40 years,
that man has been dead and gone.

01:16:06.483 --> 01:16:07.484
My dad.

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:09.194
Ben Burton.

01:16:12.155 --> 01:16:16.535
So how in the hell is he terrorizing me
here, now, in the real world?

01:16:17.536 --> 01:16:19.121
-He attacked me at Mom's place...
-He attacked you?

01:16:19.204 --> 01:16:22.499
Yeah. So am I just crazy, or...?

01:16:23.834 --> 01:16:26.461
I don't know. He, uh...

01:16:29.756 --> 01:16:32.676
left this for my mom the day he died.

01:16:35.929 --> 01:16:37.848
What ends with him?

01:16:40.225 --> 01:16:43.103
-Josh...
-Is that the answer? Am I just crazy?

01:16:43.854 --> 01:16:45.522
Is his madness inside of me?

01:16:45.606 --> 01:16:49.318
Is that why I've been so lost
the past few years?

01:16:49.401 --> 01:16:52.613
Did I pass this curse on to our kids?
Is he gonna haunt them...

01:16:52.696 --> 01:16:53.989
-Josh, Josh.
-...like he haunted me?

01:16:54.072 --> 01:16:55.824
Why didn't my mother say
anything about this?

01:16:55.908 --> 01:16:56.742
Stop.

01:16:57.618 --> 01:16:58.785
You're not crazy.

01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:01.413
You're not crazy.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.374
Then what's happening to me?

01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:54.883
Dalton.

01:17:59.721 --> 01:18:04.351
So Dalton and I could travel
to some other...

01:18:05.853 --> 01:18:07.062
dimension...

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:12.985
where we were haunted
by ghosts and goblins.

01:18:15.529 --> 01:18:17.990
More like entities,

01:18:18.073 --> 01:18:20.784
like the one in those photos
that haunted you.

01:18:22.244 --> 01:18:24.413
And your father, he saw them too, and...

01:18:24.496 --> 01:18:26.623
Maybe he's just reaching out.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:33.255
Back then, he told your mom.
She didn't understand.

01:18:33.338 --> 01:18:36.466
-She didn't know how to help him.
-Help him like you helped us?

01:18:37.467 --> 01:18:38.969
By suppressing our memories?

01:18:39.678 --> 01:18:43.098
We all thought it was for the best, Josh.
You included.

01:18:43.765 --> 01:18:46.768
But you got foggy.

01:18:50.606 --> 01:18:52.941
The suppression, it slowed you down.

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:55.819
And your mom and I,
we didn't know what to do.

01:18:55.903 --> 01:18:58.280
And I was too scared
to tell you the truth.

01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:01.325
Dalton was right.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:08.040
He said my mom had secrets,
that she was hiding something from us.

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:11.710
I just never thought you did too.

01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:15.547
-For ten years...
-You have no idea...

01:19:15.631 --> 01:19:18.133
-...you have kept this away from me.
-...how hard it has been for me.

01:19:18.217 --> 01:19:19.593
-Just why? Why? Why?
-You don't understand--

01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:22.012
Because you tried to kill our family.

01:19:24.515 --> 01:19:27.392
You chased us around the house
with a goddamn baseball bat!

01:19:29.102 --> 01:19:30.103
-What?
-I mean, I knew

01:19:30.187 --> 01:19:31.980
that it wasn't you. I knew it was that...

01:19:32.064 --> 01:19:35.442
thing in those photos, but the kids?
They don't understand.

01:19:36.026 --> 01:19:38.403
All those night terrors that Foster had.

01:19:38.487 --> 01:19:41.448
I've been lying to our children
for a decade,

01:19:41.532 --> 01:19:43.450
telling them those memories aren't real.

01:19:43.534 --> 01:19:46.912
"They're just your imagination.
Dad's not gonna hurt you."

01:19:47.538 --> 01:19:49.164
-I couldn't.
-But you did.

01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:53.669
Doesn't matter to them
what was controlling you.

01:19:54.461 --> 01:19:57.798
What they saw was your face.
It was you who was causing all that pain.

01:20:00.175 --> 01:20:03.554
That's why I pulled away. I just...

01:20:04.805 --> 01:20:06.598
I couldn't live like that anymore.

01:20:18.485 --> 01:20:19.486
You know...

01:20:21.822 --> 01:20:23.282
we could've gotten through this together.

01:20:31.164 --> 01:20:32.165
Is this you?

01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:37.504
Dalton just sent this to me.

01:20:38.297 --> 01:20:40.757
He's been having nightmares and visions.

01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:43.010
Something about a red door.

01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:46.638
And now this.

01:20:47.848 --> 01:20:48.849
What do we do?

01:21:57.459 --> 01:21:58.627
I'm scared.

01:21:59.253 --> 01:22:00.712
It's gonna be okay.

01:22:00.796 --> 01:22:02.506
-It's gonna be okay.
-I don't know...

01:22:02.589 --> 01:22:05.259
It's okay. Nothing's gonna happen to us.
I promise you, okay?

01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:07.052
Take care of your brother, Dalton.

01:22:07.719 --> 01:22:09.680
Okay.

01:22:14.685 --> 01:22:15.811
Here.

01:22:16.436 --> 01:22:18.188
But why is Daddy mad at us?

01:22:33.954 --> 01:22:35.289
Mommy. Mommy...

01:22:35.372 --> 01:22:37.499
I can go into the dark place
and find Daddy.

01:22:37.583 --> 01:22:39.793
-No, it's too dangerous.
-I can do it, though.

01:22:40.586 --> 01:22:42.171
Okay, just be careful.

01:22:54.016 --> 01:22:55.017
Come on.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.350
No! Stop! What are you doing?

01:23:38.227 --> 01:23:40.270
Stop! What are you doing?

01:23:42.272 --> 01:23:44.024
Dad, please, just stop.

01:23:44.107 --> 01:23:45.484
Just stop!

01:23:46.068 --> 01:23:47.611
No!

01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:51.573
Stop!

01:24:17.224 --> 01:24:19.434
And now, my dear friends,

01:24:19.518 --> 01:24:23.689
I'd like to dedicate this song
to all of you out there.

01:24:23.772 --> 01:24:25.649
Wherever you may be,

01:24:25.732 --> 01:24:29.361
this song is for you.

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.624
♪ Fill your heart with love today ♪

01:24:42.708 --> 01:24:46.587

♪ Forget your mind and you'll be free ♪

01:25:41.099 --> 01:25:43.101
Just checking on you.

01:25:48.482 --> 01:25:49.316
Okay.

01:25:50.692 --> 01:25:52.694
Sitting on the floor, being weird.
That's normal.

01:25:53.779 --> 01:25:56.490
So you're good, right? Because...

01:25:56.573 --> 01:25:57.783
I thought that when the power went out,

01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:59.952
that maybe you were messing
with that dark realm shit again.

01:26:01.286 --> 01:26:03.872
And I know
that you don't really care for the dark.

01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:06.041
So I figured...

01:26:06.124 --> 01:26:08.585
I would illuminate your room,

01:26:08.669 --> 01:26:10.712
much like how I illuminate your life.

01:26:11.338 --> 01:26:13.465
I'm not afraid of the dark anymore.

01:26:14.216 --> 01:26:15.217
Okay.

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.261
Well, I hauled these
all the way down here,

01:26:17.344 --> 01:26:19.054
so they're going up anyway.

01:26:20.013 --> 01:26:21.807
Even though you're totally
freaking annoying.

01:26:24.852 --> 01:26:27.229
So, um, listen...

01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:31.984
I got your text
and I wrote a snarky response.

01:26:32.067 --> 01:26:33.110
And then I deleted it,

01:26:33.193 --> 01:26:36.488
because Grandma Perkee always told me
to never escalate an argument over text.

01:26:36.572 --> 01:26:38.031
Doesn't convey tone.

01:26:40.534 --> 01:26:42.452
But, I mean, if you want my opinion...

01:26:43.704 --> 01:26:44.830
here it is.

01:26:46.164 --> 01:26:48.584
Don't go digging around in your past.

01:26:49.877 --> 01:26:52.045
Some things are just better
left buried, you know?

01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:53.589
And...

01:26:54.506 --> 01:26:57.050
sometimes you just have to move on.

01:27:07.436 --> 01:27:08.437
Dalton?

01:27:48.352 --> 01:27:49.186
Hey.

01:28:07.829 --> 01:28:10.207
Dalton. You okay?

01:28:26.348 --> 01:28:31.019
♪ Knee-deep in flowers, we'll stray ♪

01:28:31.103 --> 01:28:35.649
♪ We'll keep the showers away ♪

01:28:35.732 --> 01:28:39.862

01:28:58.797 --> 01:28:59.798
Dalton.

01:29:07.639 --> 01:29:08.891
Dalton.

01:29:10.517 --> 01:29:11.602
Dalton?

01:29:31.246 --> 01:29:32.456
Dalton?

01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:39.630
No.

01:29:45.052 --> 01:29:47.971
Oh, no! No, no, no!

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:54.853
Daddy's here.

01:29:55.521 --> 01:29:57.439
I'm gonna get you
out of this place, Dalton.

01:30:09.409 --> 01:30:11.995
We're gonna get out of here
and we're gonna get home, okay?

01:30:12.079 --> 01:30:13.205
We're never going back there.

01:30:20.587 --> 01:30:22.464
Dalton. What?

01:30:39.356 --> 01:30:40.440
Dalton.

01:30:44.444 --> 01:30:46.280
Dalton, tell me you're in there.

01:30:47.155 --> 01:30:47.990
Dalton.

01:30:49.992 --> 01:30:52.035
Dalton, I know you're in there.

01:30:52.119 --> 01:30:54.371
But if you touch me again,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.306
Dad, no!

01:31:22.107 --> 01:31:23.192
You tried to kill me.

01:31:23.775 --> 01:31:25.319
-It wasn't me.
-I saw you!

01:31:26.403 --> 01:31:29.281
Dalton, these things,
they can possess our bodies.

01:31:29.364 --> 01:31:32.117
It happened to me,
and now he's done it to you.

01:31:34.703 --> 01:31:36.121
He's coming back for you.

01:31:37.748 --> 01:31:38.582
We've got to go.

01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:44.630
Come on.

01:32:25.128 --> 01:32:26.296
He's coming!

01:32:26.797 --> 01:32:27.798
Go!

01:32:32.678 --> 01:32:33.512
Dalton, help me!

01:32:35.639 --> 01:32:36.473
Help me hold the door!

01:32:51.738 --> 01:32:55.242
-No!
-We can't hold it back, Dad.

01:32:55.325 --> 01:32:57.661
Son, we got to try.

01:33:01.123 --> 01:33:02.666
Go, get away!

01:33:08.255 --> 01:33:09.464
No!

01:33:10.924 --> 01:33:12.885
No! No!

01:33:12.968 --> 01:33:13.927
Dalton, come on!

01:33:14.011 --> 01:33:16.972
We got to find something to block it.
Something to seal it.

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.396
Come on, let's go.

01:33:25.606 --> 01:33:27.107
-Dad, please.
-Dad!

01:33:27.191 --> 01:33:28.859
We have to go!

01:33:33.739 --> 01:33:34.781
It's okay.

01:33:36.658 --> 01:33:37.659
You go.

01:33:42.915 --> 01:33:43.749
Go.

01:33:56.428 --> 01:33:57.262
Get away!

01:34:03.352 --> 01:34:04.186
Get off!

01:34:06.813 --> 01:34:07.940
No!

01:34:17.199 --> 01:34:18.575
No! Oh, God.

01:34:21.411 --> 01:34:22.454
Josh.

01:34:23.664 --> 01:34:24.665
Josh.

01:34:27.209 --> 01:34:29.920
This ends with me.

01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:12.504
Paint?

01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:20.554
Paint. Dalton.

01:36:21.156 --> 01:36:23.784
You need to get rid of that thing.
Burn it, forget about it.

01:36:23.867 --> 01:36:27.788
No, no, forgetting it doesn't work.
We need to remember.

01:36:27.871 --> 01:36:29.414
Even the things that hurt.

01:37:05.742 --> 01:37:06.743
Dad?

01:38:30.911 --> 01:38:33.830
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:38:37.167 --> 01:38:38.460
Is Dalton okay?

01:38:38.544 --> 01:38:41.213
-He's okay.
-Okay.

01:38:43.632 --> 01:38:44.633
That's him.

01:38:47.386 --> 01:38:48.220
Dalton.

01:38:48.303 --> 01:38:49.388
Is Dad back?

01:38:49.471 --> 01:38:52.015
Yes. Yes, he's back. He's okay.

01:39:22.588 --> 01:39:23.839
See you next Friday.

01:39:24.756 --> 01:39:27.885
Tell Foster to pack his history homework.
I'll help him with it.

01:39:28.677 --> 01:39:31.638
Could come a little earlier if you want.
Join us for dinner.

01:39:33.056 --> 01:39:35.350
Yeah, I'd like that. Thanks.

01:39:57.873 --> 01:39:58.916
Lovely home.

01:39:58.999 --> 01:40:00.334
Oh, thanks.

01:40:01.084 --> 01:40:03.253
-Do you live here?
-I hope so.

01:40:04.546 --> 01:40:05.797
That's a weird answer.

01:40:06.632 --> 01:40:08.383
Guess I'm just lost in memories.

01:40:09.134 --> 01:40:11.053
They can flood the mind.

01:40:19.019 --> 01:40:20.103
I know you.

01:40:22.898 --> 01:40:24.525
May have seen me around.

01:40:25.609 --> 01:40:26.902
I know your mother.

01:40:31.823 --> 01:40:33.450
There's so much I want to tell her.

01:40:34.076 --> 01:40:37.204
I know. And you can.

01:40:37.955 --> 01:40:40.707
And you will. Someday.

01:40:41.542 --> 01:40:43.585
You have a bright future ahead.

01:40:44.127 --> 01:40:45.128
You and Dalton.

01:40:48.799 --> 01:40:50.843
Keep a steady stride, Josh.

01:42:09.129 --> 01:42:10.422
Wow.

01:42:13.091 --> 01:42:14.259
I made the wall.

01:42:18.639 --> 01:42:19.473
Yeah.

01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:22.142
I love you, son.

01:42:23.268 --> 01:42:24.478
I love you too.
