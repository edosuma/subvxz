It is the largest

00:19.786 --> 00:24.883
The Cromwell family has collected
everything from furniture and paintings
to medieval weaponry.

00:24.958 --> 00:30.089
This, of course,

no pun intended-

00:30.163 --> 00:31.960
the Alexander diamond.

00:32.031 --> 00:35.468
It was worn by Queen Elizabeth
at her coronation.

00:35.535 --> 00:40.063
- <i>Experts have called it</i>
<i>the most perfect diamond in the world.</i>
- It's beautiful.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.438
<i>You're probably wondering</i>
<i>what it's worth.</i>

00:42.509 --> 00:45.706

<i>I mean, it was completely locked down.</i>

14:04.510 --> 14:09.243
Somehow they opened
that connecting door from the inside.
We can't figure it out.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.443
What do you think?
I don't know yet.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.749
Well, come on. Focus. Concentrate.
Do that thing you do.

14:15.821 --> 14:19.188
I've never seen you like this.
What, broke?

14:23.762 --> 14:26.697
Ah.
What?
What, what, what?

14:26.765 --> 14:30.292
These scratches here and here-

14:31.370 --> 14:36.273
Looks like these tire irons
weren't heavy enough
to do the job-

14:36.342 --> 14:40.676
[St. Clare]
Gentlemen, we have competition.
That is Adrian Monk.

14:40.746 --> 14:44.648
- Adrian Monk?
I thought he worked homicide.
- <i>[Man] Oh, what are you two afraid of?</i>

14:46.185 --> 14:49.245
Something's off here.
What is it?

14:52.992 --> 14:55.256
Glass shards on the inside.

14:58.797 --> 15:04.633
When that case was shattered,
this case was open.

15:04.703 --> 15:09.663
I think they took this weapon,
used it, then put it back
and relocked the case.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.075
Wha-What does that tell us?
A lot.

15:13.145 --> 15:17.809
It means it was an inside job,
and they didn't want us to know
it was an inside job.

15:17.883 --> 15:21.148
[Giggles]
Ka-ching!
What does that mean?

15:21.220 --> 15:24.280
[Natalie On Headphones]
It means we're gonna be rich.
Ka-ching!

15:24.356 --> 15:26.551
This guy's good.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.559
What's he saying?
[Feedback]

15:28.627 --> 15:31.460
Put that thing away.
What's wrong with you?

15:31.530 --> 15:37.469
Excuse me, sir.
Did anything unusual happen Tuesday,
before the break-in?

15:37.536 --> 15:39.697
Anything at all
out of the ordinary?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.706
No.

15:41.774 --> 15:47.212
Well, now that you mention it,
Tuesday afternoon I heard- or I thought
I heard- somebody whispering.

15:47.279 --> 15:52.342
Whispering.
It wasn't in this room.
It was, uh, down the hallway.

15:52.418 --> 15:56.013
It was about 2:30.
I was standing about there,

15:56.088 --> 16:00.252
and I thought I heard
someone saying "my womb."

16:00.326 --> 16:02.260
My room?
"My womb."

16:02.328 --> 16:05.855
It was a man's voice,
and he was saying it over and over.
My womb.

16:05.931 --> 16:09.492
- I thought it was coming
from that vent, but it's impossible.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

16:09.568 --> 16:11.661
I think I'm... going senile.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.898
I'm sorry.
I've got to take this.
[Beeps]

16:13.973 --> 16:15.907
Hello?
My womb.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.967
My womb.
It sounds like a mantra,
like a meditation.

16:19.044 --> 16:22.536
My womb. My womb.
My womb.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.081
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>My</i>- 

16:32.157 --> 16:34.216
<i>[Door Rolls Up]</i>

16:36.996 --> 16:38.429
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>What?</i>

16:38.497 --> 16:41.057
It's a footprint.

16:41.133 --> 16:45.160
Somebody was hiding in here.

16:45.237 --> 16:51.107
Wait. In there?
That's how they opened
the connecting door.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.339
Let's grab the detectives.
We need an evidence kit.
Wait. Not yet.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.473
What do you mean, not yet?
Let's find the diamond,
then we'll tell 'em how we did it.

16:57.549 --> 17:02.953
Natalie, this is not a game show.
This- this is a felony.
Investi-

17:08.127 --> 17:13.121
It's a broken necklace.
That's an unusual design.

17:13.198 --> 17:17.224
<i>Oh, good.</i>
<i>We'll try and I.D. It.</i>
<i>Come on. Let's get outta here.</i>

17:18.971 --> 17:21.269
- [Monk] Oh.
- Sorry.

17:24.276 --> 17:27.575
You okay?
Oh, I don't know.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.978
Something's-
Something's wrong. L-
What?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.949
<i>I'm a little-a little</i>- 
<i>[Sighs]</i>

17:32.017 --> 17:34.508
I'm not balanced.

<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>Um, excuse me. Yeah, um,</i>
<i>I'm gonna be needing that back...</i>

17:43.562 --> 17:46.861
because I only have two of them,
and the other one doesn't work.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.298
Are you following us?
What?

17:49.368 --> 17:53.668
Ah, Mr. Monk, what an honor.
My name's St. Clare-
Inspector St. Clare.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.503
I've been following your cases assiduously
from across the pond, you know.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.135
<i>Hey, Shakespeare, nobody cares.</i>

17:59.211 --> 18:01.805
- Wait. I can't believe
you're following us.
- Is that a lead?

18:01.880 --> 18:04.713
Maybe.
Uh-

18:04.783 --> 18:09.686
Look. Mr. St. Clare- Inspector,
I'm sure a gentleman like yourself
can appreciate the fact...

18:09.755 --> 18:12.485
that these two leads belong to us.

18:12.558 --> 18:17.586
- Two leads?
- Well, yes, the necklace
and the initials carved in the desk.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.063
Mr. Monk.
I'm sorry.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.357
[Whispers]
Go. Go. Go. Go.

18:29.174 --> 18:33.076
Excuse me.
My name is Jennie Mandeville,

18:33.145 --> 18:37.878
and, uh-
[Whispers]
I did something I'd like to confess.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.781
Well, what did ya do, Jennie?

18:43.555 --> 18:46.547
[Whispers]
I robbed a bank.

18:46.625 --> 18:50.721
It was about three weeks ago-
the Community Savings Trust
in Sausalito.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.960
Sausalito?
I don't remember
anything about that.

18:55.033 --> 18:58.628
I'll take it.
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Disher.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.605
Uh, Jennie?
Uh, Miss Mandeville.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.314
Just, uh, have a seat.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.374
[Clears Throat]

19:15.988 --> 19:21.221
- Uh, is there a problem?
- I'm claustrophobic.
Is this the only room that you have?

19:21.293 --> 19:26.287
All the rooms are the same size, miss.
Please, just have a seat.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.630
[Switches Clicking]

19:29.701 --> 19:33.603
This is Lieutenant Disher.
I'm in Interrogation Room "A"
with Jennie Mandeville.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.267
So, you say you robbed a bank?

19:37.342 --> 19:39.867
That's right.

19:39.945 --> 19:43.244
I went inside, and...

19:43.315 --> 19:47.945
I saw one of those pens-
you know- chained to the desk?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.352
And I really needed a pen,

19:50.422 --> 19:55.291
so... I snapped it off,
and I put it in my purse.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.453
You stole a pen?

20:00.199 --> 20:03.794
One pen?
[Sniffling]

20:03.869 --> 20:07.100
Oh, God.
Do you think God will forgive me?

20:07.172 --> 20:09.106
I don't know, ma'am-

20:09.174 --> 20:12.143
<i>[Switch Clicks]</i>
But we do.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.202
You're free to go.

20:21.320 --> 20:26.724
God, what is up with those three detectives?
Do you think we lost them?
Ah, Natalie, they are not detectives.

20:26.792 --> 20:30.853
They're rent-a-cops. They're hired guns.
They are mercenaries.

20:30.929 --> 20:34.763
In other words, they're us.
This whole thing is about greed.

20:34.833 --> 20:38.826
Okay, you know how you always say
you'll thank me later? You'll thank me later.
Ooh, that's gotta be him.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.896
<i>Hello, are you Mr. Kwan?</i>

20:44.910 --> 20:49.347

I think he nodded. Was that-
Was that a-Was that a nod?

Sir? Sir, could-

20:54.086 --> 20:56.919
If that was a nod, nod.

20:56.989 --> 21:00.516
Sir, we found this
at the scene of a crime-
a robbery.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.584
We've been doing some research.
This is your design, isn't it?

21:03.662 --> 21:06.096
You give these to your students?
Natalie, please.

21:06.164 --> 21:10.999
Sir, you-you, uh-you have a thread
hanging, uh, right in the middle, there.

I'll just- I'll get it.
Just one lone-

21:13.171 --> 21:15.036
Um-
If you just-
<i>Okay.</i>

21:15.107 --> 21:18.975
Okay. Mr. Kwan,
you look like a very busy man,
so I'm just gonna get right to the point.

21:19.044 --> 21:22.036
Do you have a student that could fit
inside of a rolltop desk?

21:22.114 --> 21:26.210
He can't be more than five feet tall.
Does that ring a bell... or a gong?

21:26.285 --> 21:29.652
Mr. Monk,
you're distracting him.
No. He's distracting me.

21:29.721 --> 21:33.452
Is there anyone here who is
that small and limber-who could
scrunch up inside of a desk?

21:33.525 --> 21:35.459
A scruncher-
a little scruncher?

21:35.527 --> 21:37.961
- Mr. Kwan, there's a lot of money
at stake here.
- Got it.

<i>[St. Clare]</i>
<i>Well, well, well. Mr. Monk.</i>

21:40.299 --> 21:44.235
We meet again. Surprised?

21:44.303 --> 21:48.797
- Why don't you get your own clues?
- Well, normally I do,
but you two are so easy to follow,

21:48.874 --> 21:52.241
<i>especially when you're kind enough</i>
<i>to keep your emergency blinker on</i>
<i>all day long.</i>

21:52.311 --> 21:55.007
I told you.
It's the safest way to drive.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.277
<i>Wait.! Don't question anybody yet.</i>

21:58.350 --> 22:04.220
- I have a voice stress analyzer.
I'll be able to tell if he's lying or not.
- He hasn't said anything.

22:04.289 --> 22:09.249
- You are a pathetic little frog, aren't you?
- You thought you could lose me, huh?
Well, you can all just relax.

22:09.328 --> 22:14.231
Dirk'll take it from here.

<i>I got $200 here.</i>
- Two hundred dollars?

Hello, Mr. Chasen!
[Panting]

23:17.062 --> 23:19.860
Hi. Is this your necklace?
We found it in a museum.

23:19.931 --> 23:24.061
Okay! Where's the diamond?
Hey! Hey, I'm talkin' to you!

23:27.506 --> 23:30.168
Wow, that's a really deep trance.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.911
Couldn't be deeper.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.188
You know the drill.

23:56.435 --> 24:00.337
I don't like this room.
Please, Miss Mandeville.

24:00.405 --> 24:03.499
You said you had
something important to tell me-
something about a dead body.

24:03.575 --> 24:09.411
And you said
you didn't wanna talk in my office.
I told you I'm claustrophobic.

24:09.481 --> 24:14.544
What about another room?
All our interrogation rooms
are the same size, unfortunately:

No wet bars, noJacuzzis-

24:16.621 --> 24:19.613
Please, just have a seat.

24:21.193 --> 24:25.220
Now, you said you found a body-
your roommate's body.

24:28.366 --> 24:31.665
This, um-
This is a real thing, right?

24:31.736 --> 24:37.504
Not like, uh, stealin' the pen
from the bank?
Okay, good.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.874
Tell me about it.

24:39.945 --> 24:42.675
This is, uh, Lieutenant Disher.
I'm in Interrogation Room "D"...

24:42.747 --> 24:45.875
talking with Jennie Mandeville...
again.

24:45.951 --> 24:51.048
So, let's start from the beginning.
What was your roommate's name?
Tony.

24:51.122 --> 24:53.989
Tony?
Tony what?
I don't know.

24:55.193 --> 24:58.026
You don't know.
Male or female?

24:58.096 --> 25:00.587
I think male.
You're not sure?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.936
To tell you the truth,
I just brought him home
the day before.

25:08.206 --> 25:13.974
Okay, um, let's move on.
So, um, you came home.

25:14.045 --> 25:19.278
You found Tony, and you-what,
disposed of the body yourself?

25:20.752 --> 25:24.779
<i>You realize that's a federal offense?</i>
I couldn't take it, okay?

25:24.856 --> 25:27.848
I couldn't just stand there looking at it.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.955
Jennie, what did you do with the body?

25:32.030 --> 25:34.555
I flushed it down the toilet.

25:40.972 --> 25:44.100
- Was Tony a goldfish?
- A hamster.

25:44.175 --> 25:46.075
A hamster.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.412
Okay.

25:55.287 --> 26:00.088
[Stottlemeyer] Here's the coroner's report.
Victim's name: Danny Chasen.
It's probably an alias.

26:00.158 --> 26:05.562
Victim was poisoned.
Somebody spiked his all-natural
barley tea with ammonia.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.497
Was he... part of the heist?
Looks like it.

26:08.567 --> 26:12.469
They found some hair samples
in that rolltop desk at the museum.
They match the body.

26:12.537 --> 26:16.735
Okay, what about the diamond?
Still missing in action.
It wasn't on him or in the cabin.

26:16.808 --> 26:21.472
We know he had a partner-
somebody who works at the museum.
It's probably still with him.

26:21.546 --> 26:25.243
Uh, w-wait, wait.
So, the reward's still good, right?
I mean no one's claimed it.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.684
Yes. As far as I know,
the offer is still good.

26:28.753 --> 26:32.655
Ka-ching.
[Groans]
Can you make her stop saying that?

26:33.725 --> 26:38.355
This is no longer a parlor game. A man is dead.
This is a homicide investigation now,
which means...

26:38.430 --> 26:43.026
nobody is to withhold
any information
from anybody.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.569
What?
You're lookin' at me?
Yes, I am, Miss Teeger.

26:47.639 --> 26:52.133

<i>Don't deny it. I know it was you.!</i>

Hint, hint."

"Monk was right.
You should clean under the table."
You don't fool me for a second.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.547
"It goes without saying-
don't forget to throw away
these little Post-its too."

27:05.624 --> 27:09.116
Captain, she never cleans
under the table.
You are not the boss of me!

27:09.194 --> 27:11.526
I think I am.
What makes you think
you're the boss of me?

27:11.596 --> 27:13.530
If I was the boss of you,
you'd be fired!

27:13.598 --> 27:15.532
Why do you think-
Whoa!
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! No!

27:15.600 --> 27:21.038
Hey, separate, both of you.
Monk, over there.
Gladys, can I have a word with you, please?

27:25.143 --> 27:30.877
Look.

Try to ignore him.

Can you ignore him?

27:35.120 --> 27:39.750
No, I can't.
Just do the best you can.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.827
[Jennie]
So you're not gonna arrest me?
No, not this time, miss.

27:52.904 --> 27:56.271
But next time you feel
like confessing something,
you might wanna call a priest.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.606
Will you, uh, escort
Miss Mandeville out?
No problem.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.670
[Whistles]

28:02.747 --> 28:05.215
Who's she?
Loony tune of the month.

28:05.283 --> 28:09.447
Her name's, uh, Jennie Mandeville.
She keeps coming in here
and confessing to stuff.

28:09.521 --> 28:14.424
What was it this time?
She comes in, same as yesterday-
she says she accidentally killed her roommate.

28:14.492 --> 28:19.759
So I take her into the back room,
and I turned on the tape recorder.
Turns out her roommate was a hamster.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.561
[Chuckles]
She didn't look unstable.

28:22.634 --> 28:26.297
They never do.
Okay, can we get back to work now?
The missing diamond, remember?

28:26.371 --> 28:28.032
Ka-ching!

28:28.106 --> 28:32.406
"Ka-ching"?
She is putting
so much pressure on me.

28:32.477 --> 28:36.208
She's obsessed
with this million dollar reward-
obsessed.

28:36.281 --> 28:40.047
All right. Well, Adrian,
she's worried about money.
Now, I know a lot of people are.

28:40.118 --> 28:45.920
Not me. When I was on the force,
I used to hate cashing my paycheck.
I still do.

28:45.990 --> 28:50.654
To me, police work is-
it's like a higher calling,
like the priesthood.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.289
But you know, Adrian,
even priests have to get paid.

28:53.364 --> 28:58.825
But i-it brings up an interesting question,
something I would like to explore with you.

28:58.903 --> 29:03.067
What would you do
if you had a million dollars?

29:03.141 --> 29:09.080
Oh. Well, uh, I guess I'd-

29:09.147 --> 29:14.551
I'd hire you full-time
and keep you on retainer, 24-7.

29:14.619 --> 29:17.782
Maybe I'd buy you a house
right next to mine,

29:17.856 --> 29:21.121
so I could just drop in anytime.

29:22.193 --> 29:25.185
Heh. This is fun.
What would you do
with a million dollars?

29:25.263 --> 29:27.823
Buy an island-

29:27.899 --> 29:33.235
a desert island in... the middle of nowhere.

29:34.305 --> 29:38.105
So, w-we would do our sessions
o-over the phone?

29:38.176 --> 29:42.806
[Chuckles]
Well, you see-
see, this island, in my mind-

29:42.881 --> 29:44.815
no phone service.

29:46.718 --> 29:49.448
I guess I'd have to buy a boat.
Well, see, that's funny,

29:49.521 --> 29:55.153
because the island
in-in my fantasy- no dock.

29:57.996 --> 30:00.294
Well, may the best man win.

30:01.933 --> 30:06.393
Excuse me! What are you doing?
Did you see that? There-

30:06.471 --> 30:10.999
There was someone out there.
I'm going to have to report this.
It's- It's okay. It's okay.

30:11.075 --> 30:15.444
It's just another detective
trying to find the diamond.

30:15.513 --> 30:17.504
There's a whole bunch of them.

30:17.582 --> 30:22.485
Yesterday they followed us
down the coast to that big
meditation center in Monterey.

30:22.554 --> 30:25.853
Oh, I've been there.
It-It's just beautiful.

30:25.924 --> 30:29.325
But this was years ago,
when Jennie Mandeville was still alive.

30:30.762 --> 30:36.200
Jennie... Mandeville.
Jennie Mandeville.
Yeah, she owned the property.

30:36.267 --> 30:41.705
There's this big plaque there
with her name on it.
That's right.

30:43.208 --> 30:46.177
I remember.
I saw it.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.203
What?

30:49.280 --> 30:54.343
I just solved the case.
I think I know where that diamond is.

30:54.419 --> 30:58.048
Ugh! I have to go.
We'll add 20 minutes on
to my next session.

30:58.122 --> 31:00.590
Ah, A-Adrian.
Adrian, I'm sorry. I have a policy.

31:00.658 --> 31:04.059
L-lf- If you leave early, I have to
charge you for the whole session.
[Groans]

31:04.128 --> 31:06.119
Yeah.
Mmm. It's-

31:07.799 --> 31:09.790
Uh-
Okay.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.305
[Chuckles]

31:16.374 --> 31:19.901
O-kay. O-kay?

31:22.213 --> 31:24.204
Okay.

31:25.483 --> 31:29.749
[Bell Clanging]

31:29.821 --> 31:32.984
<i>Natalie.! Natalie, I did it.</i>
<i>I solved the case.!</i>
<i>I know where the diamond is.!</i>

31:33.057 --> 31:36.891
What? So where is it?
It's at the police station.
It's been there the whole time!

31:36.961 --> 31:39.953
It's been right under our nose.
Oh, my God.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.226
<i>Who would do that to my car?</i>

31:44.669 --> 31:48.332
[Whispers]
Oh, my God.
Natalie, they're listening.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.340
What?
[No Audible Dialogue]

31:50.408 --> 31:52.342
[Loudly]
What I meant was,

31:52.410 --> 31:56.506
I didn't solve the case. I wish I had.
I'm completely stumped.
What are you talking about?

31:56.581 --> 31:59.675
No. Wait.
What I really meant was,
I <i>did</i> solve the case.

31:59.751 --> 32:04.518
The diamond is in the Philippines.
We gotta go to the airport,
fly to the Philippines.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.524
Well, if we're gonna run,
just run. Run!

32:08.927 --> 32:12.363
<i>[St. Clare]</i>
<i>Monk.! Mr. Monk.!</i>

32:12.430 --> 32:14.421

32:38.256 --> 32:40.747
They ran down that alley.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.061
Get outta the way.

32:46.130 --> 32:49.622

I can't believe this guy.

33:46.657 --> 33:48.591

Can you see him?

33:48.659 --> 33:51.822
We lost him.
Wait.
[Panting]

33:51.896 --> 33:56.196
We've been following Monk.
We've been watching Monk.
Why don't we try thinking like Monk?

33:57.535 --> 33:59.935

- <i>[Delivery Boy]</i>

- He went that way. [Laughs]

34:30.835 --> 34:34.668
I think we lost 'em.
You keep saying that,
but we never do.

Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Police headquarters, Vinton Street.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doin', chief?

34:45.516 --> 34:48.007
I'm with her.
You got to ride in the back.
That's the rule.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.681
Ah, l-l-I'd prefer to sit up front.
It's one of my things.
It's true. It's one of his things.

34:51.755 --> 34:55.192
- Well, here's one of my things:
Nobody rides in the front.
- I'm afraid it's not negotiable.

34:55.259 --> 34:59.821
- Who's negotiatin'?
That's it. I'm outta here.
- No. W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait.

34:59.897 --> 35:04.459
- I'll give you, uh, 50 bucks
if you let him ride up front.
- Why? What's he gonna do?

35:04.535 --> 35:09.370
Nothing. Nothing. He's got a cluster of,
uh, compulsions and phobias that manifest
themselves in a variety of-you know?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.670
It's one of those things! He has things!

35:11.742 --> 35:14.267
- A hundred dollars.
- [Groans]

35:14.345 --> 35:16.677
- All right. Seventy-two.
That's all I have.
- Welcome aboard.

35:16.747 --> 35:21.207
Whoa. Whoa, uh, wait.
This inspection sticker expired yesterday.

35:21.285 --> 35:24.482
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm takin' care of that tomorrow.
- It expired. It's expired.

35:24.555 --> 35:29.652
[Sighs, Quietly]
Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars.
Please get in the cab for me.

35:29.727 --> 35:33.163
- It's expired.
- Well, forget about it. Forget about it.
Give me back my money.

35:33.231 --> 35:36.962
- No refunds. Its one of <i>my</i> things.

Couldn't we sort something out here?

Where's-Where's-Where's-

- [Monk] Di-
- [Natalie] Di-

35:56.220 --> 35:57.710
Oh, Disher.
Yeah, yeah.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.313
- L-I think he's in the observation room.
- [Monk] Come on.

36:00.391 --> 36:05.351
Oh, all right, Gladys.
We're bein' followed.
Don't tell anybody you saw us!

36:09.734 --> 36:13.602
They locked the doors!
It says "Push"!
Get outta the way!

36:20.545 --> 36:22.877
That way.

36:22.947 --> 36:26.906
Lieutenant! Lieutenant, remember
the security guard that you arrested?
[Disher] Yeah.

36:26.984 --> 36:29.316
Where did you interrogate him?
Right there- Room "B."

36:29.387 --> 36:32.015
Ah! And the girl
that kept confessing,
Jennie Mandeville-

36:32.089 --> 36:34.387
- Where did you take her?
- Uh, Room "A" then Room "D."

36:34.458 --> 36:38.918
- So she was never in there?
It's gotta still be in there. It's in that room.
- What's in there? Monk, what's going on?

36:38.996 --> 36:42.329
- Tell you later.
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
You cannot come in here.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.233
My two friends are American citizens.
They have a right to be here.

36:45.303 --> 36:48.466
Myself, I am on a temporary visa...
which I hope to extend.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.975
- Are they with you?
- Only in the strictest,
most terrible sense of the word.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.637
- I heard you tell your shrink
you solved the case.
- <i>[Natalie] Excuse me.</i>

36:57.014 --> 37:01.644
Nobody's going anywhere-
not until we know what he knows.
<i>[Key Clatters]</i>

37:01.719 --> 37:06.747
All right, you just made a big mistake
my friend. I happen to be a police captain,
and this is an unlawful imprisonment.

37:06.824 --> 37:10.817
Book him.
You're under arrest. Turn around.

37:13.731 --> 37:17.394
[Disher]
Fine.
Give me your hands.

37:17.468 --> 37:20.232
- Do you have your cuffs?
- In my office.

37:21.305 --> 37:23.933
It's in there, isn't it?

37:24.008 --> 37:27.068
The diamond-
it's in that very room.
What?

37:27.144 --> 37:29.009
It is?
Uh, no, uh-
Get the door!

37:29.080 --> 37:32.413
[All Clamoring]

37:32.483 --> 37:35.850
Shut up!
Everybody, shut up.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.754
Everybody but Monk.
Monk, what's goin' on?

37:39.824 --> 37:43.055
[Sighs]
Okay, here's what happened.

37:43.127 --> 37:46.187
The woman who founded
the meditation center
was named Jennie Mandeville.

37:46.264 --> 37:50.200
- Who, the confessor?
- No. No, no, no. The girl you met
was not the realJennie Mandeville.

37:50.268 --> 37:55.035
<i>She got the name from a plaque</i>
<i>she saw up at the retreat.</i>

37:55.106 --> 37:57.267
<i>She needed a fake name.</i>
<i>Maybe she liked the sound of it.</i>

37:57.341 --> 38:03.280
- What was she doing up there?
- She went there to kill Danny Chasen,
the guy in the rolltop desk.

38:04.715 --> 38:07.343
<i>It was probably her boyfriend's idea.</i>

38:07.418 --> 38:11.081
<i>Jewel thieves are like children.</i>
<i>They hate to share.</i>

38:14.292 --> 38:19.229
This is a very crowded room.
This is a very, very, very, very, very,
<i>very,</i> very, very, very, very-

38:19.297 --> 38:22.164
Monk, Monk, Monk, Monk,
it's okay. It's okay.
Who was her boyfriend?

38:22.233 --> 38:24.565
He was the security guard
that Randy arrested.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.627
<i>He was thejewel thief.</i>
<i>He was the inside man.</i>

38:27.705 --> 38:30.401
<i>The diamond was still in his pocket</i>
<i>when you were talking to him.</i>

38:30.474 --> 38:33.671
<i>[Disher]</i>
<i>That's right. We brought him here</i>
<i>right from the museum.</i>

38:33.744 --> 38:37.043
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>I remember before the interrogation</i>
<i>he was chewing a big piece of gum.</i>

38:37.114 --> 38:41.380
<i>But when I saw him after the interrogation,</i>
<i>the gum was gone.</i>

38:41.452 --> 38:46.219
<i>He must have panicked in that room.</i>
<i>You had him on the drug charges.</i>
<i>He knew he was about to be arrested</i>- 

38:46.290 --> 38:50.852
<i>which of course meant he'd be searched</i>- 
<i>so he hid the rock right there under the table.</i>

38:50.928 --> 38:54.295
<i>[Stottlemeyer] With his chewing gum.!</i>
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>People do it in restaurants all the time.</i>

38:54.365 --> 38:57.766
<i>I've written letters to my congressman</i>
<i>and to the editor. What can I do?</i>

38:57.835 --> 39:01.271
He telephoned his girlfriend
from jail to tell her where
he stashed the diamond.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.103
And that's why
she was coming in here
confessing to everything.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.235
And why she was always
asking to switch rooms.
She was trying to get in there.

39:07.311 --> 39:09.939
Oh- oh, okay.
I changed my mind.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.710
There's seven of us,
and we're all adults.

39:12.783 --> 39:17.015
- We'll just divide the money seven ways.
- No way. We were here first.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.955
It's only fair we divide the proceeds.
We have been working in tandem.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.993
We've not been working in tandem.
You've been chasing us.
That's not tandem.

39:23.060 --> 39:26.928
Excuse me, could I say one thing?
You and you and you-

39:26.997 --> 39:29.295
uh, you're breathing my air.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.530
What about them?
They're breathing your air,
you're breathing his-

39:32.603 --> 39:35.800
It's complicated.
Uh, but if these two dropped back, um-

39:35.873 --> 39:39.036
Monk. Monk, it's okay.
I'll call for help.
Okay.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.738
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Gladys.

39:41.812 --> 39:46.249

- No! No!
