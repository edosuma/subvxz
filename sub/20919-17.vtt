00:01.744 --> 00:04.003
<i>[Captain America on communicator]
Avengers Assemble!</i>

00:04.078 --> 00:06.747
<i>All team members converge
on Central Park.</i>

00:06.823 --> 00:08.210
<i>Falcon, you're on scene.
What do you see?</i>

00:08.234 --> 00:11.251
I have eyes on an unknown
energy signature.

00:11.328 --> 00:13.737
<i>What is it? What's it look like?</i>

00:13.739 --> 00:15.505
It looks like
an unknown energy signature.

00:24.250 --> 00:27.693
This just showed up out of nowhere.
How big is it?

00:27.770 --> 00:29.686
Big. And getting bigger.

00:32.758 --> 00:34.775
Pull back. Everyone, pull back!

00:34.851 --> 00:36.368
[all yelling]

00:40.266 --> 00:42.041
[yelling continues]

00:44.620 --> 00:45.936
[wind howling softly]

00:45.938 --> 00:48.939
[groans] Huh?

00:48.941 --> 00:50.999
[gasps] Where are we?

00:52.611 --> 00:54.202
Oh. Oh, wow.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.722
Wow.

00:56.799 --> 00:59.207
Wow!

00:59.285 --> 01:01.451
Hey, guys?

01:01.453 --> 01:03.711
Cap? Other Cap?

01:03.789 --> 01:07.124
First Cap? Wake up!

01:07.126 --> 01:09.142
Come on, Avengers.
[both groaning]

01:09.219 --> 01:11.403
I'm gonna need all of you
to wake up now.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.647
Weirdness is easier when we share.
[groaning]

01:13.723 --> 01:16.983
[Wasp] We're alive.
That's a start.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.152
But what happened to new York?

01:19.229 --> 01:21.972
Not picking up any satellites
or positional data.

01:21.974 --> 01:24.975
I'm not even sure
we're on Earth anymore.

01:24.977 --> 01:29.479
So, that thing in Central Park
was some sort of transporter?

01:29.481 --> 01:32.666
I have a question.
Why is the sand moving?

01:35.579 --> 01:38.088
[grunts]

01:45.088 --> 01:47.180
Avengers Tower?

01:47.257 --> 01:48.665
That's impossible.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.593
Last time we saw the tower,
it had been obliterated.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.112
Where are we?

02:07.202 --> 02:09.110
This is a trick, right, Hawkeye?

02:09.187 --> 02:11.463
This has to be a trick.

02:11.540 --> 02:13.132
Or an illusion or something.

02:13.208 --> 02:17.452
I don't know how, but everything
checks out. Hmm. [Grunts]

02:17.529 --> 02:21.198
She's right. Doesn't make sense.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.867
But this is Avengers Tower,
just how Tony designed it...

02:23.869 --> 02:26.478
before...

02:26.555 --> 02:29.556
Before we lost Iron Man.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.984
<i>[man over P.A.] Well, hello there.
Please, don't be shy.</i>

02:32.060 --> 02:33.780
<i>Join me in the conference room,
won't you?</i>

02:38.734 --> 02:42.977
Avengers! Welcome home.

02:43.055 --> 02:44.290
This must be confusing for you.

02:44.314 --> 02:48.392
Please, sit and enjoy yourselves.
[chomping]

02:48.394 --> 02:50.394
Who are you?

02:50.396 --> 02:54.080
I am from Beyond.

02:54.157 --> 02:56.508
He asked <i>who</i> you are,
vanilla shake.

02:56.585 --> 02:58.902
I've told you. I'm from Beyond.

02:58.904 --> 03:00.662
You're the Beyonder. Got it.

03:00.739 --> 03:03.740
"Beyonder." [chuckling]
I like that.

03:03.742 --> 03:05.133
Mind if I use that? [Chomping]

03:07.504 --> 03:10.430
Please, sit, eat, drink.

03:10.507 --> 03:14.175
Respectfully, we're not
interested in sitting and eating.

03:14.253 --> 03:15.453
We wanna know what's going on.

03:17.923 --> 03:20.315
I said, "Sit down"!

03:24.096 --> 03:25.262
[sighs]

03:25.264 --> 03:28.432
They never listen
the first time.

03:28.434 --> 03:31.210
Fine. If you insist
on being tiresome...

03:31.286 --> 03:33.194
You are on Battleworld,

03:33.272 --> 03:37.441
a planet I built from parts of
other worlds, including your own.

03:37.443 --> 03:41.553
I brought you here to be part
of my grand experiment.

03:41.630 --> 03:44.223
You built this world
to be your experiment?

03:44.299 --> 03:47.059
Yes. And you're all part of it.

03:47.135 --> 03:49.636
You took parts from Earth?

03:49.713 --> 03:52.122
From the entire planet?
So, like, is Earth okay?

03:52.124 --> 03:56.384
The fate of your old home world
is unimportant now.

03:56.462 --> 04:01.222
You're on a new world. See, you're
really missing the big picture here.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.909
No more confusing talk,
little man.

04:03.986 --> 04:06.152
You better put Earth
back together now!

04:12.068 --> 04:13.810
No.

04:13.812 --> 04:15.245
[Avengers yell]

04:17.666 --> 04:20.375
[straining]

04:23.989 --> 04:26.080
Come at me again,
you green beast,

04:26.158 --> 04:28.600
and I will rip you in two.

04:28.677 --> 04:32.329
[Captain America] This has
gone far enough, Beyonder.

04:32.331 --> 04:34.131
You need to restore Earth
back the way it was.

04:34.166 --> 04:37.609
[straining continues] There's no
need for you Avengers to worry.

04:37.686 --> 04:39.002
You'll be fine
here on Battleworld.

04:39.004 --> 04:42.764
I'm sure you'll survive.
Maybe even thrive.

04:42.841 --> 04:45.266
Now, I have many others
to look in on.

04:45.344 --> 04:47.177
We'll speak again soon.
[chomping]

04:47.179 --> 04:50.622
Mm, mm, mm! These are good!

04:50.699 --> 04:52.866
Oh, you are missing out.

04:52.942 --> 04:54.451
Take care now.

05:02.619 --> 05:06.029
[Captain America] The Avengers have emergency
plans for every possible situation,

05:06.031 --> 05:07.622
but we don't have one for this.

05:07.699 --> 05:09.883
[Black Widow]
Avengers Tower may be back,

05:09.959 --> 05:11.513
but we're not at
full functioning capacity.

05:11.537 --> 05:14.962
We have no satellites, a
barebones communications array,

05:15.040 --> 05:16.982
and we're running
on backup power.

05:17.059 --> 05:18.444
And since none of our scans
are going out,

05:18.468 --> 05:21.561
we don't know anything
about the layout of Battleworld.

05:21.638 --> 05:24.042
[Captain Marvel] Then it's high
time we did something about that.

05:24.066 --> 05:26.216
Let's break up into recon teams,

05:26.218 --> 05:27.442
scout this new world we're on.

05:32.057 --> 05:35.650
Pair up in teams of two, head
out in different directions.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.985
Report back with what you find.

05:38.063 --> 05:40.466
[Captain America] We don't know
how dangerous this new world is.

05:40.490 --> 05:43.333
Don't take any chances.
Look out for each other.

05:48.665 --> 05:51.091
Come on, Falcon.
Race you to the upper deck.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.687
Does everything have to be a race?
Yep!

05:55.581 --> 05:58.932
Captain Marvel, I'm picking up
some weird anomaly above us.

05:59.008 --> 06:03.511
Nothing special from up here. Just
clear sky and sand in ev... [grunts]

06:03.589 --> 06:05.647
Captain Marvel, hold on!

06:10.262 --> 06:13.187
Carol, are you hurt?

06:13.265 --> 06:17.209
Just my pride.
Guess that's one I owe you.

06:17.285 --> 06:19.269
Army, this is Air Force.
You copy?

06:19.271 --> 06:21.362
<i>[Captain America] I'm here.
Did you find something?</i>

06:21.440 --> 06:24.774
Invisible barrier
covering the sky.

06:24.776 --> 06:27.034
Beyonder doesn't want us
escaping anytime soon.

06:27.112 --> 06:30.463
<i>Copy that. Keep looking.
We'll do the sa... [static]</i>

06:33.452 --> 06:36.970
Our comms are out of range with the other
scout teams. We're on our own now.

06:40.308 --> 06:41.808
That's not a mirage.

06:41.885 --> 06:44.236
That's a pyramid.

06:44.312 --> 06:46.312
Ugh!

06:46.389 --> 06:48.240
Whoa.

06:48.316 --> 06:50.057
You okay, Natasha?

06:50.135 --> 06:52.244
Not used to
seeing you this angry.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.156
First Loki scatters us all over
space and time, and now this?

06:56.232 --> 06:59.567
I'd like to have five minutes where
things just make sense for once.

06:59.645 --> 07:00.902
We're all in this together.

07:00.979 --> 07:04.756
None of what we're seeing
makes a lick of sense,

07:04.833 --> 07:06.407
but we'll figure it out
and adapt.

07:06.485 --> 07:08.910
I was in an iceberg
for a long time.

07:08.987 --> 07:12.672
When I came out... Well, culture
shock doesn't even cover it.

07:12.749 --> 07:17.084
Everything was so different and
so much the same all at once.

07:17.162 --> 07:18.603
You seemed to handle it
pretty well.

07:18.680 --> 07:20.922
I try to focus
on what's really important...

07:20.999 --> 07:24.091
My friends, my team, my mission.

07:24.169 --> 07:26.836
As long as I can do that,
I can stay grounded.

07:26.838 --> 07:30.949
[chuckles]
You're such an optimist, Cap.

07:31.026 --> 07:33.952
If the Beyonder
was responsible for all this,

07:34.029 --> 07:36.938
the power of his technology
must be immense.

07:37.015 --> 07:39.251
Would be nice if we had someone on
our side with that kind of genius.

07:39.275 --> 07:42.035
Yeah. I miss Tony too.

07:44.539 --> 07:46.206
A way in.

07:46.282 --> 07:47.749
Let's check it out.

07:57.369 --> 07:59.703
These look
like ancient Egyptian,

07:59.705 --> 08:02.205
but I don't think
they're quite right.

08:02.207 --> 08:03.890
We need to keep digging.

08:10.565 --> 08:11.973
If this place
is an Egyptian tomb,

08:12.050 --> 08:13.775
there's bound to be tra...

08:15.887 --> 08:16.811
[growling]

08:16.888 --> 08:17.987
Mummies!

08:20.225 --> 08:21.574
[mummies growling]

08:21.651 --> 08:22.651
[grunts]

08:26.081 --> 08:28.122
[grunts]

08:40.669 --> 08:43.355
How's that optimism holding up?
[grunts]

08:43.431 --> 08:44.748
[growling continues]
It's been better.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.340
Aah!

08:46.418 --> 08:47.675
Cap!

08:47.753 --> 08:48.601
[grunting]

08:48.678 --> 08:49.861
Aah!

08:52.941 --> 08:55.275
Are you okay? I'm fine.

08:55.351 --> 08:57.018
But who fired those blasts?

08:57.095 --> 09:00.187
That would be me.

09:00.265 --> 09:02.766
Hey, kids.

09:02.768 --> 09:04.267
[together] Tony?!

09:04.269 --> 09:05.710
Welcome to Battleworld.

09:08.957 --> 09:12.717
Funny finding you here. [Captain
America] Tony, you're alive?!

09:12.794 --> 09:14.794
But how did you end up...
[mummies growling]

09:14.871 --> 09:16.963
Just one sec, Cap.

09:19.117 --> 09:20.675
Iron Man stuff I gotta do.

09:22.137 --> 09:23.395
Hey, Natasha.

09:23.471 --> 09:25.288
[click] What are you doing?

09:25.290 --> 09:26.898
You need an upgrade.

09:26.975 --> 09:28.567
Lower power, wider arc.
Have fun.

09:31.463 --> 09:35.148
Nice. Uh, thanks?

09:35.224 --> 09:37.634
Friends don't let friends
fight mummies alone.

09:37.636 --> 09:38.956
Now, if you'll excuse me
a moment.

09:48.313 --> 09:49.754
[growling]

09:57.656 --> 09:59.047
[roars]

10:00.342 --> 10:01.716
[grunts]

10:03.678 --> 10:05.345
[growling]

10:07.757 --> 10:10.183
That went faster than expected.

10:10.259 --> 10:12.593
Well, I guess we should... No,
no... I don't believe it!

10:12.671 --> 10:15.447
Whoa. Okay. All right. All right.
Iron Man in the flesh!

10:15.523 --> 10:18.283
We thought you were dead.
Is it really you?

10:18.360 --> 10:22.695
And now I have to explain
every little thing to you.

10:22.772 --> 10:24.697
Same old, same old.
All right. Come on, guys.

10:24.774 --> 10:26.124
Let's walk and talk.

10:30.856 --> 10:32.257
[Black Widow] But you
had no tools, no tech.

10:32.281 --> 10:34.707
When we lost all contact with
you in that other dimension,

10:34.784 --> 10:36.117
we thought you were a goner.

10:36.194 --> 10:39.453
How did you get yourself
out of that pocket dimension?

10:39.531 --> 10:44.125
How did you guys get here? We were
investigating something weird in Central Park.

10:44.202 --> 10:45.604
Then... Then there was
this big white light,

10:45.628 --> 10:47.128
and everybody ended up here.

10:47.205 --> 10:49.539
Got it.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.650
Do you already know
what's going on here?

10:51.726 --> 10:55.302
And if so, how about
you fill us in?

10:55.380 --> 10:57.822
Have you met
the "I am from Beyond" guy yet?

10:57.899 --> 11:00.492
The Beyonder.
We're calling him the Beyonder.

11:00.568 --> 11:01.976
I was calling him Suspenders.

11:02.053 --> 11:06.055
The Beyonder. Huh.
A little 1980s rock.

11:06.057 --> 11:08.408
But that works.
Let's go with that.

11:08.484 --> 11:10.001
Tony, what about our questions?

11:10.078 --> 11:11.411
What?

11:11.487 --> 11:13.730
Fine.

11:13.732 --> 11:15.415
The "too long,
didn't read" version.

11:15.491 --> 11:16.851
<i>This planet's
called Battleworld.</i>

11:16.902 --> 11:20.011
<i>Beyonder put it together
like a jigsaw puzzle...</i>

11:20.088 --> 11:21.883
<i>Pieces of Earth, bits of other
worlds, other dimensions.</i>

11:21.907 --> 11:24.590
<i>I got pulled here when the
Beyonder yanked a section</i>

11:24.667 --> 11:26.500
<i>of that no-tech dimension
I was lost in.</i>

11:26.578 --> 11:27.802
<i>Lucky me, huh?</i>

11:30.098 --> 11:32.190
How long have you been here?
Not sure.

11:32.267 --> 11:34.245
Been exploring, collecting
data, staying off the grid.

11:34.269 --> 11:36.419
I'm still me.

11:36.421 --> 11:38.588
Figuring things out is what I do.
What have you figured out?

11:38.590 --> 11:42.091
That I really need something
behind these doors.

11:42.093 --> 11:43.693
[grunts]

11:49.192 --> 11:50.533
And there's my orb.

11:55.273 --> 11:59.292
Somebody else thinks you're important too.
Be careful, Tony.

11:59.368 --> 12:00.719
That statue... whatever it is...

12:00.795 --> 12:04.630
It's been inscribed in the walls
all through the pyramid.

12:04.707 --> 12:07.058
That's supposed
to be Moon Knight.

12:07.135 --> 12:08.687
Legend says he's the guardian
of the pyramid.

12:08.711 --> 12:10.061
But if I'm ever... Sorry.

12:10.138 --> 12:13.380
If <i>we</i> are ever going to take
a run at the Beyonder

12:13.458 --> 12:14.566
and get off Battleworld...

12:16.628 --> 12:18.895
we definitely need this.

12:21.299 --> 12:23.891
Guess you guys wanna know
what the orb does.

12:23.969 --> 12:26.393
See, I'm not always
so self-absorbed.

12:26.471 --> 12:27.471
I can think of others.

12:29.641 --> 12:31.157
[Black Widow] Tony, look out!

12:31.234 --> 12:33.084
[grunting]

12:33.161 --> 12:35.236
He's after the orb!

12:35.313 --> 12:36.162
Well, he can't have it.

12:36.239 --> 12:38.539
It's mine,
and it's too important.

12:41.987 --> 12:42.987
[grunts]

12:44.413 --> 12:45.755
[grunts]

12:48.343 --> 12:52.053
Stay on your toes. It's like Moon
Knight is one with his environment.

12:56.684 --> 12:58.726
Watch out!
Our Moon Knight is quick.

13:03.266 --> 13:04.783
[grunts]

13:04.859 --> 13:07.268
[grunts] Yeah, he's strong too!

13:07.345 --> 13:08.511
[grunts]

13:08.513 --> 13:09.862
[both grunt]

13:27.215 --> 13:28.881
[grunts]

13:33.462 --> 13:35.980
[grunting]

13:41.637 --> 13:44.146
Forget Moon Knight!
We got what we came for.

13:49.979 --> 13:53.331
This is his pyramid.
He has the advantage.

13:53.408 --> 13:55.008
Okay, I've officially
had enough of this.

14:00.565 --> 14:02.006
[grunting]

14:10.425 --> 14:12.833
That went well.
Are you out of your mind?

14:12.911 --> 14:14.501
You almost got us
killed in there!

14:14.579 --> 14:17.747
Of all the half-baked,
reckless...

14:17.749 --> 14:19.348
Yeah. It's good
to have him back.

14:22.754 --> 14:24.594
Score one for the good guys.
[creature roaring]

14:28.610 --> 14:29.942
[rumbling]

14:32.764 --> 14:34.372
[growls]

14:34.449 --> 14:37.266
[roaring]

14:37.268 --> 14:39.210
And score one for the bad guys.

14:45.944 --> 14:47.043
[growling]

14:49.447 --> 14:52.056
[grunts]

14:52.133 --> 14:53.950
[Black Widow]
They're after the orb.

14:53.952 --> 14:56.394
It took me forever
to find the thing.

14:56.471 --> 14:57.303
I'm not gonna give it up now.

14:57.380 --> 14:58.396
[growling]

14:58.473 --> 14:59.805
[grunts]

15:04.646 --> 15:06.046
[mummies growling, hissing]
[grunts]

15:11.469 --> 15:13.227
[grunts]

15:13.304 --> 15:15.562
Cap, I gave Natasha her upgrade.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.657
Here's yours!

15:24.149 --> 15:26.424
Tony, next time,
tell me before you do that!

15:26.501 --> 15:28.909
Fine.

15:28.987 --> 15:32.655
Next time I throw
a grenade at you,

15:32.657 --> 15:34.590
I'll try to remember
to warn you first.

15:39.998 --> 15:41.597
[growling]

15:46.020 --> 15:48.780
We'll never outrun them.
We don't have to.

15:48.856 --> 15:51.616
We just have to reach Marsha.
Come on!

15:51.693 --> 15:53.067
[together] "Marsha"?

15:57.515 --> 15:59.365
Think fast!

16:03.855 --> 16:06.706
Cap, be really careful.
Don't drop this. [Grunts]

16:09.027 --> 16:10.543
Keep that thing away from them!

16:10.619 --> 16:12.786
[growling]
Tony, where are you going?

16:12.864 --> 16:16.382
I'll be right back!

16:16.459 --> 16:18.792
He ran out on us.
No, he's just being Tony.

16:18.870 --> 16:22.814
Whatever his plan is, he didn't want
to waste time talking about it.

16:22.890 --> 16:25.041
Remember...
Friends, team, and mission?

16:25.043 --> 16:26.392
Yeah, you're right.

16:26.469 --> 16:29.729
Just hope whatever Tony's
got up his sleeve is good.

16:29.805 --> 16:31.814
[grunts] [roars]

16:34.886 --> 16:37.478
Hey, Marsha. Did you miss me?

16:37.555 --> 16:40.147
[growling]

16:40.225 --> 16:41.240
[roars]

16:41.317 --> 16:42.333
[grunts]

16:46.231 --> 16:48.414
[growling]

16:48.491 --> 16:49.790
[grunts]

16:53.662 --> 16:56.422
[grunts] [growling continues]

16:56.499 --> 16:57.757
[grunts]

16:59.427 --> 17:00.427
[straining]

17:04.432 --> 17:06.140
[yells]

17:10.012 --> 17:11.186
[grunts]

17:20.265 --> 17:22.598
Well, isn't that something?

17:22.599 --> 17:24.282
[grunts, yells]

17:28.439 --> 17:30.381
[grunts]

17:30.458 --> 17:32.366
I don't think the orb
is drawing him.

17:32.443 --> 17:34.701
I think it's controlling him!
And them!

17:34.779 --> 17:36.212
[growling]

17:42.620 --> 17:44.303
[roaring]

17:44.380 --> 17:45.805
[horn blaring]

17:48.142 --> 17:49.142
[brakes screech]

17:50.645 --> 17:52.812
Marsha's a truck?

17:52.888 --> 17:54.008
[engine revs, tires screech]

18:05.310 --> 18:06.475
[grunts]

18:06.477 --> 18:08.644
[grunts]

18:08.646 --> 18:10.571
Hey, I'm Iron Man.

18:10.648 --> 18:12.540
Remember me?

18:15.320 --> 18:16.577
[growls]

18:16.654 --> 18:18.154
Bad kitty-cat.

18:18.156 --> 18:19.931
[snarls]

18:23.161 --> 18:24.677
[grunts] [grunts]

18:24.753 --> 18:25.753
[grunts]

18:36.599 --> 18:38.190
[growls]

18:40.102 --> 18:41.102
[screeches]

18:43.681 --> 18:45.105
Man, I'm good.

18:45.183 --> 18:46.198
Cap!

18:51.356 --> 18:52.779
Aah!

18:52.857 --> 18:54.132
[crying out]

18:56.694 --> 18:58.377
[wind howling]

19:06.721 --> 19:08.554
[Marsha whirring, clanking]

19:10.041 --> 19:11.557
[alarm chirps]

19:11.634 --> 19:13.726
We saved the orb for you.

19:13.802 --> 19:15.769
Not a scratch on it. Oh, thanks.

19:19.050 --> 19:20.825
[object thuds on ground] What?

19:23.145 --> 19:26.071
Oh, right. Forgot to mention.

19:26.148 --> 19:27.223
This was never actually
about the orb.

19:27.225 --> 19:29.325
<i>This</i> is what I needed.

19:31.320 --> 19:35.398
Was that what was controlling me
all this time?

19:35.400 --> 19:37.675
No. Pretty sure
that was the orb.

19:37.752 --> 19:40.794
Somebody didn't want anyone
getting their hands on this.

19:43.090 --> 19:45.832
Well, all I can say
is thank you, and...

19:45.910 --> 19:47.518
Look out! [Growling]

19:50.598 --> 19:51.742
Think it's our turn
to thank you, Moon Knight.

19:51.766 --> 19:55.418
We could always use
another soldier.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.420
Let us take you back
to Avengers Tower.

19:57.422 --> 19:59.939
Thank you for that, but no.

20:00.015 --> 20:02.758
My place is to study
and protect this area.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.686
The evil forces
that lurk within the pyramid

20:05.763 --> 20:07.947
are waiting to rise again.

20:08.023 --> 20:10.041
My destiny is tied here to it.

20:10.117 --> 20:11.709
The offer still stands.

20:11.786 --> 20:14.787
If you ever change your mind, you
can find us at Avengers Tower.

20:18.443 --> 20:20.384
But be careful out there.

20:20.461 --> 20:26.131
This world is unpredictable
and dangerous.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.375
Yeah? Well, so are we, buddy.

20:28.453 --> 20:30.010
So are we.

20:36.885 --> 20:38.978
[Hawkeye]
Well, lookie who's back!

20:39.054 --> 20:40.963
It's Tony!

20:40.965 --> 20:43.148
All right! Iron Man!

20:43.225 --> 20:44.984
I don't believe it.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.728
Whoa! How many lives
do you have, anyways?

20:47.805 --> 20:51.565
Yes, it's true. I am amazing.
Invincible, even.

20:51.642 --> 20:55.311
Now that we've added Tony's
information to what we've found,

20:55.313 --> 20:57.313
we have a rough mapping
of Battleworld.

20:57.315 --> 20:59.665
[Iron Man] Better than that.
This Beyonder guy

20:59.742 --> 21:02.985
used an incredible amount of tech
to build and maintain Battleworld.

21:02.987 --> 21:05.504
He uses a lot more to keep
tabs on all the people here.

21:05.581 --> 21:09.583
But with this, I can make us
invisible to anything he's got.

21:09.660 --> 21:12.828
Now we can take the fight
to the Beyonder.

21:12.830 --> 21:15.589
[solo slow clap]

21:15.666 --> 21:18.776
Yes. Very well done indeed,
I must say.

21:20.838 --> 21:23.447
Hello, new friends and old.

21:23.524 --> 21:26.008
It is I, Loki,

21:26.010 --> 21:34.010
and I have come
to join the Avengers.
