WEBVTT

00:55.848 --> 00:56.973
All right.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.184
Okay. Come on, now.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.811
Come on, boy.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.400
Let's not take your sweet-ass time
about this. Jesus.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.194
All right.

01:10.821 --> 01:11.821
Okay, that's it.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.825
Ah, good.

01:16.285 --> 01:19.287
Don't laugh, I outlived you,
you little bastard.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.005
Goddamn it. Son-of-a-bitch.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.352
Breakfast of champions.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.369
You trying to tell me Sammy Davis Jr.
Was better looking than Robert Redford?

02:00.537 --> 02:01.579
No question.

02:01.747 --> 02:02.789
Better actor too.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.501
Sammy should've been
the Sundance Kid.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.836
Ah. You're out of your mind.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.545
No, they're right.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.133
Sammy only had one eye,
but he cut quite a figure.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.055
I know what you're doing.

02:19.223 --> 02:22.391
You're trying to piss me off,
but it's not gonna work. Not this time.

02:27.439 --> 02:28.481
Strike.

02:42.871 --> 02:47.291
You boys enjoy the fishing,
I'll see you up in the Carolinas.

02:47.459 --> 02:50.711
Where you going, Gus?
Aren't you gonna see what he's got?

02:50.879 --> 02:53.005
I've seen all this guy's got.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.175
My daughter can throw better than that.

02:56.885 --> 02:57.927
Good luck.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.890
Mickey, it's time.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.101
Yep.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.897
- They're ready for you, Miss Lobel.
- Thank you.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.950
Hard to believe it's been seven years.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.787
Time flies when you're
working your ass off.

03:24.955 --> 03:28.249
Excuse me, doing your life's work.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.336
So where do you stand
on the Landau case?

03:32.504 --> 03:35.798
- I like my chances.
- That could be quite a coup for us.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.634
It's all very impressive.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.636
Thank you.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.431
You'd be the youngest partner
this firm's ever had.

03:43.599 --> 03:47.518
There is a reason I've not taken a Saturday
off in seven years. I want this. Bad.

03:47.686 --> 03:51.147
So does Todd.
He's been productive for a long time.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.733
He's a quality associate.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.610
But I have been more productive.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.654
And I agree with you,
he is a quality associate.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.490
You'd be the only woman.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.661
Gentlemen,
my father is a baseball scout.

04:06.163 --> 04:10.291
And while he was hardly attentive, the one
thing he did give me was experience.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.126
I took a lot of road trips.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.879
I grew up around men who swore,
drank, and farted.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.257
Trust me, I can handle it.

04:18.507 --> 04:20.301
Let us bring it
to the partnership committee.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.595
- Then we'll talk.
- Great.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.349
Hudson, a 17-game winner last year...

04:26.516 --> 04:27.725
Order up!

04:29.186 --> 04:32.104
You need some money
for some new clothes?

04:33.190 --> 04:34.649
I just came from yoga.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.401
You into that voodoo, huh?

04:37.903 --> 04:42.281
Yeah. I'm thinking about getting three
sixes tattooed across my forehead.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.494
- What about the partnership?
- We're close.

04:46.662 --> 04:50.706
There's just some competition from
another attorney, but he's harmless.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.291
You got a boyfriend?

04:52.542 --> 04:55.086
I'm seeing somebody, sort of.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.506
And has he got a job?

04:59.049 --> 05:00.633
He's an attorney.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.555
Well, marry him.
He'll probably be a great provider.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.517
I can provide for myself just fine.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.646
Hudson, he's really painting
the corners tonight.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.066
Guy's a true artist.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.903
I'm gonna go.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.739
- What?
- I'm going to go.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.658
You haven't finished your dinner yet.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.535
Oh, I've had enough.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.578
Suit yourself.

05:31.748 --> 05:36.377
Absolutely tremendous. Prescott
just went three-for-three again last night.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.838
Didn't he just get arrested for assault?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.423
Allegedly.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.967
Kid's hitting 350,
ready to move to Double A.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.594
So let's not rush to judgment.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.596
You seen him play lately?

05:48.098 --> 05:49.682
I don't need to see him play.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.227
You and that computer. Heh.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.855
Need to stay current, Pete.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.191
These programs are an essential tool
to evaluating today's talent.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.153
In fact, there's only one scout
in the entire organization...

06:02.320 --> 06:05.614
maybe in all of baseball,
that doesn't use this technology.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.702
Maybe that's why he's only signed
three kids in what, last four years?

06:09.870 --> 06:12.705
This isn't like a store.
You can't just go in and get what you want.

06:12.873 --> 06:16.208
Maybe there's nothing out there.
Maybe his territory's a little thin.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.420
What about Billy Clark in Rome?
Didn't Gus sign him?

06:19.588 --> 06:22.715
Heh, yeah, and he's struggling.
Kid's in a big-time slump.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.635
He'll come around.
Gus could spot talent from an airplane.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.473
I just hope we're not missing anything,
that's all.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.974
I mean, he is getting up there.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.394
Should we send him to look at Gentry?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.773
Of course. The Carolinas are his territory.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.900
Draft's in nine days.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.486
I don't want any surprises.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.655
You're talking about one of the best scouts
baseball's ever seen.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.076
You're talking about the guy that signed
Ralph Garr, Dusty Baker...

06:50.243 --> 06:52.703
Dale Murphy, Tom Glavine,
Chipper Jones.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.246
The list goes on.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.417
With all due respect, Pete,
the game's changed.

06:58.835 --> 07:01.462
It's so much bigger now. It's global.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.798
Need somebody to keep up with the times.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.884
Gus couldn't even turn on a typewriter,
let alone a computer.

07:07.052 --> 07:13.349
Look, we all hate to think it,
but he may be ready for pasture.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.813
- When's his contract up?
- Three months.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.190
We carry the option.

07:21.858 --> 07:26.362
For chrissakes, what is this?
Gus Lobel can do the job.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.948
If he proves me wrong,
I'll take full responsibility.

07:29.116 --> 07:33.119
Until then, let's just worry
about the guys on the field.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.332
Shit.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.211
Bunch of goddamn midgets
design this garage?

07:55.559 --> 07:58.811
Come on, number five.
Strike him out, boy.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.564
Billy Clark ain't got nothing on you, baby.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.401
That Billy Clark is a bum. We haven't
seen him hit a baseball all year.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.699
Come on, Billy.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.832
Here it comes, Billy.
Here it comes, baby. Go, baby.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.510
And that'll do it, with the final score

08:31.678 --> 08:34.096
Intimidators 5, Braves 2.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.682
Better luck next time, boys.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.778
How long before they release me?

08:50.155 --> 08:52.281
You're just in a slump. No big deal.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.490
I'm in a coma.

08:53.658 --> 08:57.286
Yeah. Look, when I first signed you up,
you were hitting great.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.788
You were the quickest bat alive.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.084
I don't know what my problem is.
I just can't concentrate like I should.

09:04.252 --> 09:07.463
What about your family?
They still over in Akron?

09:07.631 --> 09:10.132
- Yeah. Just outside.
- Mm-hm.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.635
When was the last time you saw them?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.346
It's been a while.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.933
They would make the drive down, but,
uh, money's just kind of tight right now.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.476
You worry about baseball.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.562
I'll take care of getting your parents here
so you can see them.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.314
No problem.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.816
Thanks, Gus.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.330
Gus, you home?

09:41.748 --> 09:43.207
Oh.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.669
It's 9:00 in the morning,
where the hell else would I be?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.504
I guess that means I can come in.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.506
Yeah, come on in.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.009
Breakfast will be here in a minute.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.178
Have a seat.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.555
Busy?

09:59.182 --> 10:01.850
Yeah. Just doing my homework, that's all.

10:06.564 --> 10:10.484
Gus, did you ever think in a million years
computers would be a part of this game?

10:10.652 --> 10:11.860
Computers?

10:13.196 --> 10:16.865
Anybody uses computers doesn't know
a damn thing about this game.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.369
If you wanted to, you could access
any high school or college roster...

10:20.537 --> 10:22.871
pull the stats on any player any time.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.666
You wouldn't have to waste time
with all these papers.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.627
I'm not wasting my time.
I enjoy doing this.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.715
You know, they got a special program now
that can calculate a player's stats...

10:32.882 --> 10:34.842
and based on the
competition he's seen...

10:35.010 --> 10:38.304
tell you whether or not he's ready
for the next level. You believe that?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.682
Yeah, what else does it tell you?
When to scratch your ass?

10:43.601 --> 10:47.229
I don't like them either,
but they're part of the business now.

10:47.397 --> 10:52.234
Pete, scouts, good scouts,
are the heart of this game.

10:52.402 --> 10:57.489
They decide who's gonna play, if they're
lucky they decide how it's gonna be played.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.243
But a computer, that can't tell
if a kid's got instincts or not...

11:01.411 --> 11:04.997
or if he can hit a cut-off man,
or hit behind the runner.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.750
Or look into a kid's face
that's just gone oh-for-four...

11:07.917 --> 11:11.587
and know if he's gonna be able
to come back like nothing's happened.

11:11.755 --> 11:15.591
No, a computer can't tell you
all that crap, I'll tell you. No.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.594
What do you think about Bo Gentry?

11:19.179 --> 11:22.097
I don't know.
He looks pretty good on paper.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.184
I'll take a look at him,
see if he can play.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.103
If the Red Sox pass with
their first pick...

11:28.271 --> 11:30.439
I know Phillip really wants to take him.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.648
Phillip.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.612
Well, tell him to check his computer.
What we need is a pitcher.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.280
Yeah.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.450
Maybe, uh, he can find one on his interweb.
Heh.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.204
Spotlight's really on this kid.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.041
Well, there's breakfast.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.298
Morning, Mr. Lobel.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.635
Got your Canadian bacon,
extra anchovies, chili peppers.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.971
- Wow, that's a work of art, Danny.
- Yeah, it's gross.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.433
- And I got your newspapers.
- Oh, thanks.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.643
Right here.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.603
- There you go.
- Thank you.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.855
- Keep that.
- Uh...

12:12.023 --> 12:14.108
Mr. Lobel, did you mean to give me 50?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.447
No, no, I was just... l was
just testing you. Heh.

12:20.615 --> 12:21.657
Here.

12:21.825 --> 12:25.244
Here's a 20 for the pizza
and keep the five for yourself.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.957
Some new kind of style I'm not up on?

12:31.042 --> 12:33.836
That's Fang-shmay.
Don't you know anything?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.348
Ah.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.100
What you looking at?

12:48.852 --> 12:50.686
Gus, are you all right?

12:50.979 --> 12:52.354
Yeah, fine.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.733
We go back. If something were wrong,
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

12:56.901 --> 12:57.943
Course.

12:59.195 --> 13:03.198
Because if for any reason,
you're not up to it...

13:03.366 --> 13:05.826
we could send somebody
from Charlotte.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.120
Might be easier on you.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.038
I don't need easier.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.043
Have you thought about what you might do
when your contract's up?

13:15.211 --> 13:18.589
Sure. Sign another one for more money.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.468
You ever think about retirement?

13:25.430 --> 13:26.972
What's this all about?

13:27.807 --> 13:30.225
There's just a lot of pressure right now.

13:30.727 --> 13:35.063
Phillip has Vince's ear. Pumping him full
of ideas. Telling him we need new blood.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.066
Young new blood.

13:38.234 --> 13:43.071
Yeah. Phillip doesn't have a lick of sense,
they're gonna find that out sooner or later.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.033
- They're worried about Billy Clark.
- Don't worry about Billy.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.744
He can hit. He just needs
to see his mama, that's all.

13:48.912 --> 13:53.081
In fact, I put in some paperwork already
to have his folks come down and see him.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.833
I can't do that.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.251
You want him to hit?

13:56.753 --> 13:57.753
Do it.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.672
You know the game better than most...

14:00.840 --> 14:04.551
and I'll always go to bat for you.
I just want to make sure you're up for it.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.846
Want something to eat?

14:09.766 --> 14:11.099
How's Mickey?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.435
Good.

14:13.603 --> 14:17.523
Good. They're gonna make her a partner
in her firm, at least she thinks.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.611
Tell her I said hey.

14:22.779 --> 14:23.779
Yeah.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.062
- Richard.
- No, I'm not.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.106
- Yeah, he tagged you.
- Come on, guys.

14:59.274 --> 15:02.150
All right, look out. A-Rod's up.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.653
This'll be an easy out, guys. Easy out.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.738
Oh, really? Then who are you gonna be?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.157
Josh Beckett.
I'm gonna throw at your A-Rod head.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.660
- We'll see about that.
- Outfielders, move in.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.000
- Hey, batter, batter.
- Hey, batter, batter.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.168
Beckett winds and delivers.

15:20.336 --> 15:24.339
He comes with a nasty slider
that A-Rod just barely gets a piece of.

15:24.507 --> 15:28.302
A-Rod's in the type of slump he couldn't
hit the beach with a beach ball.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.679
Here comes the oh-one.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.016
A-Rod lines a shot to center.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.476
The outfielder can't make the play.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.606
The ball goes under his glove,
rolling all the way to the wall.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.985
He's rounding third, gonna try to make it
home. Here comes the throw at the plate.

15:45.153 --> 15:49.323
Safe! Safe! He beat the tag!
The Yankees win the game!

15:49.490 --> 15:54.536
I do not believe it!
The Yankees win the game!

15:58.041 --> 15:59.416
What a weirdo.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.210
- Yeah, okay.
- Dork.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.379
It'd help if you wouldn't fidget.

16:05.882 --> 16:09.384
Well, if I wasn't blind, I would be after
having that light stuck in my eye.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.845
You see anything in there,
other than open space?

16:12.013 --> 16:13.472
I'm afraid I do.

16:13.931 --> 16:18.810
I'm not sure, but, uh, there are
indications of macular degeneration...

16:18.978 --> 16:20.062
or maybe glaucoma.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.563
Or maybe nothing.

16:21.731 --> 16:26.068
Well, let's find out. We'll, uh, get you
an appointment with a specialist.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.986
No, no. No appointments.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.990
- I haven't got time. I've got the season.
- Well, you better make time.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.327
Look, LIoyd, let's just pretend
I wasn't even in here.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.705
Oh, God.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.628
Blues with a feeling
That's what I have.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.171
How's it going, Gus?

16:46.339 --> 16:49.591
Crap, Jimmy. Absolute crap.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.804
- How about a game of Keno, Gus?
- I don't think so.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.098
- Come on, one game.
- I said, I don't think so.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.767
That means no, goddamn it.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.770
Okay, okay. What crawled up your ass?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.021
Old age.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.781
I just want to see where this goes.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.367
So do I.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.910
Then step up.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.413
Can we agree on being exclusive?

17:19.579 --> 17:21.415
See what happens.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.126
Just see where it goes.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.631
Mickey, I don't mean to be pushy, but...

17:29.799 --> 17:31.633
we're perfect together.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.262
Friends, lawyers.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.474
If you look at it on paper,
it makes perfect sense.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.893
I mean, a no-hitter.
Jurrjens was awesome.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.187
Couldn't have
without that catch by Heyward.

17:44.355 --> 17:48.442
Excuse me. Did you just say Jair Jurrjens
pitched a no-hitter?

17:48.609 --> 17:51.403
Walked one, or would have had
a perfect game. Blowing people away.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.988
I doubt that.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.489
I'm sorry?

17:56.409 --> 17:57.659
He's a sinker-ball guy.

17:57.827 --> 18:01.246
He's crafty, makes his living
on the corners.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.459
Wow.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.003
You're quite a baseball fan.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.881
Just picked up a few things growing up.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.517
You have one new message.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.853
Mickey, it's Daniel Rosenbloom.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.855
We've spoken with
the partnership committee.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.690
You win the Landau case...

18:28.858 --> 18:32.486
I think we'll be holding a big reception
to introduce you as the firm's new partner.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.155
Yes!

18:49.545 --> 18:53.298
Who the hell is calling me up
at this time of night?

18:54.383 --> 18:57.677
Hello?

19:05.228 --> 19:08.730
The undersigned hereby substitutes
Georgia Reconveyance Company...

19:08.898 --> 19:10.023
Mickey?

19:10.691 --> 19:13.151
- What?
- You have a visitor.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.573
Pete.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.660
Can we talk for a second?

19:23.538 --> 19:27.999
Have you noticed anything lately?
Has he been acting any differently?

19:28.251 --> 19:31.127
No, he is as unpleasant as usual.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.380
He been sick at all?

19:33.548 --> 19:34.756
I don't think so.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.970
Mick, if something goes wrong
up in Carolina with this kid Gentry...

19:40.137 --> 19:41.555
he's gonna be out of a job.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.515
Well, let's hope that doesn't happen.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.768
That would be the end
of one of the all-time great love stories.

19:47.645 --> 19:51.439
- He wouldn't do well without his work.
- What do you want me to do about it?

19:52.483 --> 19:55.527
Carolina's beautiful this time of year.

19:58.281 --> 20:01.783
No. No way.
He has his life, I have my life.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.786
That is the way it's always been.
That's the way he wants it.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.914
Just for a couple of days.
To make sure everything goes okay.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.792
It'd be nice for you two
to spend some time together.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.502
Nice for who?

20:12.670 --> 20:14.963
If you won't do it for him, do it for me.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.633
He's my friend for 30 years.
I care about him.

20:20.011 --> 20:24.139
Don't try to manipulate me.
I'm an attorney, that's my job.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.977
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm really busy right now.

20:32.023 --> 20:35.859
I appreciate your time, Mickey.
I just thought you should know.

20:53.628 --> 20:54.669
Yeah.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.798
I'm sorry about not being
around here lately.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.718
But I been working a lot and...

21:03.262 --> 21:04.721
Your little girl...

21:06.015 --> 21:07.974
you'd really be proud of her.

21:08.517 --> 21:13.897
She's gonna be made a partner in the firm.
How about that?

21:16.025 --> 21:19.235
I don't know where she got the brains.
It's got to be from you.

21:19.403 --> 21:24.199
It wasn't from my part of the family,
that's for sure.

21:24.367 --> 21:28.787
Anyway, I need you around to talk to her.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.623
You were always good at that.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.545
I have a hard time with that, you know?

21:42.677 --> 21:45.387
You are my sunshine.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.890
My only sunshine.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.727
You make me happy.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.730
When skies are gray.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.734
You'll never know dear.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.197
How much I love you.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.910
Please.

22:11.414 --> 22:14.416
Don't take your sunshine away.

22:42.695 --> 22:43.862
Cut the crap, Lloyd.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.072
I'm his daughter.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.241
Then he can tell you.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.078
Please?

22:53.831 --> 22:58.001
His eyes are going.
He needs to see a specialist right away.

23:07.803 --> 23:08.970
Who is it?

23:10.473 --> 23:12.974
If this is a robbery,
just take anything you want.

23:14.018 --> 23:17.479
But leave that flat-screen.
You take my flat-screen, I'll kill you.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.440
Did you set off a bomb in here?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.653
It's raining, for chrissake.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.907
Yeah, outside it's raining.
In here it's like a four-alarm blaze.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.536
Oh.

23:33.704 --> 23:36.748
Look, twice in one week.
What, did somebody die or something?

23:36.916 --> 23:38.708
Pete came to see me.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.420
Did you hear that Jurrjens, uh,
pitched a no-no?

23:42.588 --> 23:45.465
He wanted to know
if I thought you were okay.

23:45.633 --> 23:46.925
Yeah.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.470
I know you're a vegan and everything,
but some of this meat would re...

23:50.638 --> 23:54.015
Yeah, I told him that I thought so,
but I called Lloyd just to make sure.

23:56.352 --> 23:57.936
That's a good burger.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.191
What are you doing?
No, no. Don't do that. Don't do that, no.

24:03.359 --> 24:04.651
This is really nice.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.361
Nice stuff.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.531
Do you want to talk about it?

24:12.409 --> 24:16.162
You know how these doctors are, they
don't know their right from their left.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.373
You're always reading in the paper...

24:18.541 --> 24:21.709
about how they're taking off
the wrong part of some poor guy.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.004
You need to meet with a specialist.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.383
I've got a job to do,
and if I don't do that job...

24:28.551 --> 24:30.844
the Braves will get somebody else
to do it.

24:31.762 --> 24:34.973
You know, they already think
I should be playing Bingo...

24:35.141 --> 24:38.726
- ...and drinking little umbrella drinks.
- They can't fire you over an illness.

24:38.894 --> 24:42.147
Yeah, well, they can
certainly phase me out.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.316
I've only got three months left
on my contract.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.736
Well, how are you gonna scout this guy
if your eyes aren't right?

24:48.904 --> 24:51.489
I'll figure something.

24:52.408 --> 24:53.449
How?

24:54.535 --> 24:55.577
You hungry?

24:56.287 --> 25:00.373
You know, every good chef says that
you got to eat a meal when it's warm.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.042
You know, I had this, uh...

25:03.210 --> 25:07.922
This crazy idea you and I could actually
have a conversation about this, rationally.

25:08.090 --> 25:11.593
Well, we are. If you eat some meat,
it's great protein for you.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.761
How about that?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.560
Well, don't worry about it.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.688
I wish it were that easy, I really do.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.107
That would be awesome.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.540
Trust me, it's there.

25:43.542 --> 25:47.295
Article 15, section 2A
clearly states the precedent.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.964
Yeah, find it. Check the public record.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.133
Get back to me. Thank you.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.386
Do you work while you sleep too?

25:56.597 --> 25:58.473
When I have to.

25:58.891 --> 26:02.393
That's one good thing about not having
any family. You can focus on work.

26:03.729 --> 26:07.732
I have a family, and they're none
of your goddamn business.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.235
Excuse me.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.611
After you.

26:11.779 --> 26:12.904
Cheers, Todd.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.113
Cheers.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.000
Well, I hope you're enjoying the trip,
sweetheart.

26:27.378 --> 26:31.172
We're just entering the beautiful state
of North Carolina.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.481
Do you need an extra key?

26:48.649 --> 26:50.400
No, just one, thanks.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.777
Don't even think about it.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.281
- Room 4 is vacant. Do your homework.
- Yes, ma'am.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.659
Sorry. Last room on the end.

26:59.994 --> 27:01.786
Okay. Thank you.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.711
- I wish Daddy was here.
- I do too.

27:13.507 --> 27:14.882
Thanks.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.677
Come on, baby.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.113
I understand, Mickey.
And I fully support what you're doing.

27:37.281 --> 27:41.784
I'm just questioning the timing. There's
so much to do before the presentation.

27:41.952 --> 27:46.080
And I will get it done, okay?
You can count on me. It's just a few days.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.634
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen...

27:58.802 --> 28:01.429
and welcome
to Swannanoa Grizzlies Baseball.

28:01.597 --> 28:05.558
This afternoon,
the Grizzlies host the Fairview Raptors.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.101
Hey, guys.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.644
I think that's him.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.898
How many years they gonna hold
him back? He looks like he's 30.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.152
First thing I do when I
get in the Majors...

28:16.320 --> 28:18.488
is bang one of those chicks
on Desperate Housewives.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.033
I'm mature, I like older women.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.160
But what if they don't want to bang you?

28:25.329 --> 28:28.039
Wilson, that's a retarded question.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.793
I'll have patience with you
since you're not yet worldly.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.797
See, when a player gets to the Majors,
chicks come out of a deep freeze.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.965
They migrate from hundreds of miles.

28:38.133 --> 28:42.136
Celebrity chicks, non-celebrity chicks,
chicks from all walks of life.

28:42.304 --> 28:43.346
It's a chick-fest.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.142
Hey, yo, Peanut Boy! Over here.

28:56.652 --> 28:57.985
Two dollars, please.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.239
You want me to pay for them?

29:02.950 --> 29:05.993
It's all right, Peanut Boy.
Put it on my tab.

29:25.556 --> 29:26.681
Strike three!

29:27.599 --> 29:29.350
And that retires the side.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.853
The Grizzlies are coming up.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.703
Wow.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.044
- Hey, there, kiddo.
- Been a while. Hey.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.174
You mind?

30:01.425 --> 30:03.259
The hell are you doing here?

30:04.553 --> 30:07.805
I had some vacation days. Couldn't think
of a better place to use them.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.224
Well, they have telephones.
You could call.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.684
Yeah. You would've said no.

30:11.852 --> 30:15.897
Damn right, I would've.
You should be back home, doing your job.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.024
Same as I'm doing my job here.

30:18.192 --> 30:20.193
If it makes you feel better,
I'm doing it for Pete.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.028
He thought you could use
some company.

30:22.196 --> 30:23.905
Yeah, well, he's wrong.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.324
Wait'll I see that horse's ass.

30:27.701 --> 30:31.287
It must be so rewarding
being one of your close friends.

30:31.622 --> 30:32.997
Hmm.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.877
And now batting
for the Grizzlies, number three, Bo Gentry.

30:38.045 --> 30:41.339
Yeah, way to go, Big B! Go Bo!

30:43.592 --> 30:45.843
Let's see what everybody's
been talking about.

30:55.938 --> 30:58.689
That's the way to do it, boy!
Hustle! Hustle!

31:01.860 --> 31:04.111
- Safe.
- That's it.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.917
Ball four! Take your base!

31:18.085 --> 31:19.752
This guy sucks!

31:19.920 --> 31:21.712
Now batting for the Grizzlies...

31:21.880 --> 31:24.465
number three, Bo Gentry.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.135
Let's go, Big Bo. Number three!

31:29.137 --> 31:31.013
You're in trouble now, Bacon Boy!

31:35.852 --> 31:37.436
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.648
But if that guy calls me Bacon Boy
one more time, I'm gonna kick his ass.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.358
All right, listen to me.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.319
I want you to walk Gentry.
Don't give him anything to hit.

31:47.155 --> 31:50.074
Walk him? Have you seen the way
I've been throwing today, coach?

31:50.242 --> 31:54.161
- I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
- All right, son. Stick with it.

31:54.788 --> 31:57.081
Better put some grease on it, Bacon Boy!

31:58.458 --> 32:02.336
Oh, yeah? Too bad I used all my grease
last night on your mother.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.505
Ooh!

32:05.299 --> 32:07.800
- Douche bag.
- Come on. Play ball.

32:07.968 --> 32:09.176
Let's go, Big B.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.529
That's what I mean, boy!

32:29.865 --> 32:32.533
Yeah! Yeah! That's my boy! Ha, ha.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.497
Bring it on in! Bring it on in!

32:38.665 --> 32:40.166
Bring it on in!

32:51.386 --> 32:53.262
Y'all make a hole, make a hole now.

32:53.430 --> 32:56.432
We're not talking till after the playoffs.
Nope, I'm sorry.

32:56.600 --> 33:00.561
If you want an autographed picture of Bo,
he signs before every game.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.732
It's a bargain, 25 bucks a pop.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.067
Autographs?

33:06.234 --> 33:07.652
You've been gone a while.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.111
I guess so.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.623
What happened here?

33:21.208 --> 33:23.626
My garage is starting to shrink.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.586
- I think I'll drive.
- No.

33:25.754 --> 33:26.837
Dad, give me the keys.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.923
This is my car and I drive.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.383
Give me the keys.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.093
I said, I'll drive.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.433
Stubborn as hell.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.310
Yeah, I wonder where I get it.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.563
I want you to drive
straight to the airport...

33:44.731 --> 33:47.692
because I don't need your pointy
little nose in my business.

33:47.859 --> 33:51.946
I don't want anything to do with your
business. I'm here because you're so pig...

33:52.114 --> 33:53.406
Gus Lobel.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.034
Wow, it's good to see you, man.

33:57.786 --> 33:58.869
It's Johnny.

33:59.454 --> 34:03.207
Johnny? Oh, Johnny.
Johnny The Flame Flanagan?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.000
Nobody's called me that in a while.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.628
Yeah, well, you used to throw
the cover off the ball.

34:07.796 --> 34:08.795
Phew. I used to.

34:08.964 --> 34:10.589
What are you doing, boy?

34:10.757 --> 34:13.967
I'm here, uh, doing the same thing you are.
I'm scouting for the Red Sox.

34:14.136 --> 34:17.054
- You don't know anything about scouting.
- Don't tell them that.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.641
Yeah. This is my daughter, Mickey.

34:20.809 --> 34:23.101
Excuse us.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.855
Sorry. Hi. I'm Mickey.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.815
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.987
- Okay. You gonna be at Boots Bar later?
- Where else?

34:33.612 --> 34:35.947
- I'm buying you a drink.
- I'm taking it.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.449
Okay.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.077
- A great pitcher at one time, that kid.
- Wow.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.286
Yeah.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.789
- When are you gonna leave?
- Just get in the car.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.672
Cold beer on Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right.

34:52.841 --> 34:56.342
He can do it all.
He's more versatile than De Niro.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.345
What?

34:59.139 --> 35:00.931
Ice Cube isn't an actor.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.184
He's in the movies, ain't he?

35:03.351 --> 35:05.227
That doesn't mean he's an actor.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.355
Gus, what do they call the actors
in the movies?

35:08.523 --> 35:09.523
Actors.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.944
Plus, he can rap. Can De Niro rap?

35:14.112 --> 35:15.362
Actors don't rap.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.364
Ice Cube does. Heh.

35:17.532 --> 35:20.367
See, this is what I'm trying to teach you
about versatility.

35:20.535 --> 35:24.538
It's a crime he hasn't won
an Academy Award.

35:24.706 --> 35:29.210
That's true. Pretty soon he'll be joining
the greats like Cagney and Tracy.

35:29.377 --> 35:30.544
All the real big ones.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.213
I'm with you there, brother.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.049
All right. You did it.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.218
You pissed me off.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.557
Hi, guys.

35:44.684 --> 35:48.229
Hey, it's been a long time
since we've seen your little girl, Gus.

35:48.688 --> 35:51.398
Been a long time
since she was a little girl.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.569
The hell are you doing here?

35:55.737 --> 35:58.113
I'm taking a temporary break
from anything judicial.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.908
I just need a big drink
and a game of pool.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.910
You shouldn't be in a place like this.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.996
You used to sneak me
into places worse than this.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.415
You should be back in Atlanta,
where you belong.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.459
Yeah, well, I agree with you.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.545
Hey, Johnny!

36:13.171 --> 36:14.713
Why do they call him "The Flame"?

36:15.423 --> 36:17.424
Well, Flanagan, he...

36:17.759 --> 36:21.095
He could pitch a hundred-mile-an-hour
fastball, that's why.

36:21.263 --> 36:24.557
- So, what happened?
- He blew his arm out.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.101
They tried to bring him along too fast.

36:27.269 --> 36:29.895
Pretty soon, he was gone. Done for.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.773
I tried like mad to block that trade.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.944
How long you gonna be here anyway?

36:37.904 --> 36:40.030
I'll probably close the place down.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.456
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:49.624 --> 36:52.251
Name's Rick.
You, uh, feel like playing a game?

36:53.628 --> 36:56.297
- Sure. Mickey.
- Nice to meet you, Mickey.

36:56.464 --> 36:57.923
Hope you like losing.

37:01.511 --> 37:02.553
Ouch.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.640
Three-ball, corner pocket.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.773
One-ball, side pocket.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.003
Thanks for the game.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.008
Hey, you wanna dance?

37:41.176 --> 37:42.635
Not really.

37:43.011 --> 37:44.845
Come on, one dance.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.597
I don't think so, Dick.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.183
- Heh. It's Rick.
- Sorry.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.185
Come on, one dance.
It wouldn't hurt anything.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.854
And I mean, after the beating I just took,
you owe me.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.439
- Get off!
- Dad!

37:58.401 --> 38:01.779
You ever touch her again,
I'm gonna rip your fucking face off.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.489
- Whoa, Gus.
- Dad, take it easy.

38:03.657 --> 38:04.782
Just look at this kid.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.201
- All right, all right.
- I saw you touching her.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.703
Get out before I have
a heart attack trying to kill you.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.330
I think I'd like to see that.

38:11.498 --> 38:15.584
Enough! Hey, you know what,
this is my dad and, uh, that's my sister.

38:15.752 --> 38:19.129
And, uh, we like to get a little crazy
every now and then, especially this one.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.132
Go on, get out of here.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.225
- That was a little excessive.
- I don't think so.

38:31.393 --> 38:34.687
- You want to kill a guy touches my arm?
- I had him, you know?

38:34.854 --> 38:37.356
Yeah, no, you had him good.
You had him good.

38:37.524 --> 38:40.234
Sorry about the kiss.
I never had a sister that looked like you.

38:41.403 --> 38:43.904
You know what?
I can take care of myself just fine.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.157
- Okay. Something tells me pretty well too.
- You know what?

38:48.702 --> 38:50.244
You got what you wanted.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.579
I'm going to bed.

38:52.747 --> 38:58.919
Leaving the bar.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.761
To set the record straight,
I am 33 years old.

39:07.929 --> 39:11.473
I've been taking care of myself for a long time.
I can handle a guy in a bar.

39:11.641 --> 39:12.766
He was bothering me.

39:13.560 --> 39:17.062
All of these years, after everything
you could be bothered about, it's that.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.940
Look, I don't need your help.
I don't know why you're here.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.942
I don't know why you don't go home.

39:23.111 --> 39:27.448
Because, in spite of you, I feel this
dysfunctional sense of responsibility...

39:27.615 --> 39:29.199
to make sure that you're okay.

39:30.118 --> 39:34.121
I know I'm as blind as a slab of concrete,
but I'm not helpless.

39:34.289 --> 39:37.875
- I'll put a bullet in my head, that happens.
- That's comforting.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.090
As always, it's been really great
talking to you.

39:45.258 --> 39:48.052
I've got half a beer back at the bar
that won't argue with me.

39:49.763 --> 39:52.473
- You all right, Gus?
- Yeah.

40:12.494 --> 40:13.994
Jesus Christ!

40:14.162 --> 40:15.245
Goddamn it!

40:17.248 --> 40:19.083
Son of a bitch.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.870
Oh! Ha, ha.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.039
- Oh, my God.
- All right, check it.

40:59.207 --> 41:02.918
Your mom is so fat,
her high school photo was an aerial shot.

41:03.086 --> 41:06.004
Your mom is so fat,
they pay her in biscuits.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.548
- Your mom is so...
- Excuse me?

41:09.050 --> 41:10.884
Earth to losers?

41:12.220 --> 41:14.054
I'm trying to do my visualizing.

41:14.222 --> 41:18.058
I'm hitting homers, I'm signing
endorsement deals, I'm banging chicks.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.227
Respect my space.

41:20.395 --> 41:23.313
All right, all right, that's enough, okay?
Everybody, sit down.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.731
Back in your seat, Eric.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.943
This is a big game today.
Let's think baseball, huh?

41:32.365 --> 41:34.533
Let's tighten it up, Grizzlies.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.743
One, two, three, Grizzlies!

41:38.037 --> 41:41.415
No room for bad play. Don't suck today.

41:51.885 --> 41:52.968
There they are.

41:53.136 --> 41:54.386
Here he comes.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.096
- Hey, Gus.
- Hi.

41:56.264 --> 41:58.265
- Hey, Mickey.
- Look at you.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.104
Hey, Dad!
Dad, Dad, Dad, are you all right?

42:04.898 --> 42:06.607
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Here, come on.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.775
You okay?

42:08.943 --> 42:10.944
Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.

42:11.112 --> 42:15.115
What's the matter,
you never seen anybody trip before?

42:17.118 --> 42:18.911
Jesus Christ.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.623
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.416
Thank you.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.043
Hey, listen. About last night...

42:26.211 --> 42:27.920
it's... Forget it.

42:28.463 --> 42:29.630
Yeah.

42:30.506 --> 42:32.257
Play ball!

42:38.306 --> 42:39.765
I'll be right back.

42:40.141 --> 42:41.475
Where you going?

42:42.268 --> 42:43.644
Third base side.

42:43.811 --> 42:47.314
- What for?
- Because I'd like to get back to Atlanta.

42:48.107 --> 42:51.443
Oh, good. As long as you're here,
you might as well be helpful.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.154
- Watch his hips.
- Yeah, I know.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.615
Make sure they carry him through the ball.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.033
Yeah. I know.

42:58.201 --> 43:01.995
Okay, and his swing, is it a two-piece deal
or is it nice and fluid?

43:02.163 --> 43:05.916
And then go around the other side
and see how he goes the opposite way.

43:09.712 --> 43:11.755
Now don't just stand there, get going.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.184
Ball!

43:30.191 --> 43:32.567
Oh, yeah, this is a good idea.

43:32.986 --> 43:34.987
Why are you right next to me?

43:35.154 --> 43:38.657
Because you're the first scout
I've ever been attracted to, thank God.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.909
I'm not a scout, I'm a lawyer.

43:41.077 --> 43:44.913
Normally, a deal breaker, but I'm all about
expanding my level of tolerance.

43:45.081 --> 43:46.873
Self-improvement, et cetera.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.542
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

43:48.710 --> 43:50.043
Next up, Bo Gentry.

43:50.211 --> 43:53.005
Go, Big 3!

43:53.172 --> 43:56.383
- Hey, what do you think about dinner?
- You mean together?

43:56.551 --> 43:59.720
Whoa, that's a little forward,
don't you think?

43:59.887 --> 44:02.973
But, yeah, if you're asking me out,
I accept.

44:03.141 --> 44:04.725
I'd even consider paying.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.101
Strike!

44:06.269 --> 44:09.896
Well, it's really tempting, but I don't
plan on being around here much longer.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.815
Let's go, Bo!

44:11.983 --> 44:13.567
Bring the heat.

44:13.735 --> 44:16.903
He'll be all over the heat.
Come with the off-speed stuff.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.536
Yeah!

44:24.704 --> 44:27.414
That's it, boy! Take them bases, man!

44:27.582 --> 44:30.500
That's the fourth car this year. Ha-ha-ha.

44:33.796 --> 44:36.715
Gus must have a lot of confidence in you.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.091
So, what'd you see?

44:38.760 --> 44:41.011
He sits back on the pitch.

44:41.179 --> 44:43.305
He uses his hips and legs for power.

44:43.473 --> 44:47.059
Looks like he has pretty quick hands.
You're on your own.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.770
You know too much about baseball
to be a lawyer.

44:49.937 --> 44:51.438
It's a long story.

44:51.606 --> 44:52.773
I'd like to hear it.

44:52.940 --> 44:55.233
I don't wanna tell it.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.618
Go, Bo!

45:07.830 --> 45:08.955
Come on, Big Bo.

45:09.874 --> 45:11.792
There you go, buddy.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.795
That popped. Fastball.

45:15.922 --> 45:17.255
Hanging.

45:18.299 --> 45:20.967
How would you know with your face
buried in that?

45:21.969 --> 45:24.096
It's called multitasking.

45:25.807 --> 45:28.308
You are such an ass.

45:32.647 --> 45:34.147
That thing hear you?

45:35.066 --> 45:38.151
His name is Todd and he will,
loud and clear.

45:45.159 --> 45:46.451
There you go, baby.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.995
Breaking ball on that one.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.372
Yep.

46:09.183 --> 46:10.183
Ready?

46:19.360 --> 46:21.027
Why don't you show me what you got?

46:24.949 --> 46:26.366
Hmm.

46:30.413 --> 46:33.331
Come on, you stubborn mule.
Give me something.

46:35.126 --> 46:36.835
I'm a little old for this.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.044
I'm not.

46:38.880 --> 46:39.880
Remember

46:41.048 --> 46:44.217
- See the ball...
- "See the ball, hit the ball." I know.

46:50.892 --> 46:52.559
Whoo!

46:57.565 --> 46:59.149
What the hell are you doing?

46:59.317 --> 47:01.943
I'm enjoying my home run trot.

47:04.363 --> 47:05.405
Whoo!

47:19.295 --> 47:21.922
You snake. I'll kick your ass.

47:22.548 --> 47:24.132
Give me the keys.

47:24.300 --> 47:26.718
Come on, you're busy.
Give me the keys.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.596
Give me the keys.

47:56.499 --> 47:59.000
Hey! You all right?

48:02.129 --> 48:03.922
You know, you're lucky to be alive.

48:05.758 --> 48:07.425
How old are you, sonny?

48:07.593 --> 48:08.927
I'm 28.

48:09.428 --> 48:12.806
Well, then how the hell would you know
if I'm lucky to be alive?

48:13.599 --> 48:16.810
I know, it'll get done.
It's just a couple more days.

48:16.978 --> 48:21.898
Mickey, I'm sorry about your father,
but the client will be here next Thursday.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.151
- It's imperative that you're here to present.
- And I will be there.

48:25.319 --> 48:28.947
I'm considering bringing Todd
into the case, just till you get back.

48:29.115 --> 48:30.782
No, I'm not comfortable with that.

48:32.243 --> 48:34.452
He is a talented attorney.

48:34.620 --> 48:38.498
No, but I don't need his help.
Please, just hold off.

48:40.001 --> 48:41.501
I gotta go.

48:42.670 --> 48:46.673
Well, I guess we were lucky
we weren't on the road at the time.

48:47.675 --> 48:51.845
She was 13 years old
and she was going to her first dance...

48:52.013 --> 48:55.765
and she came in the room
and asked me what I thought of her outfit.

48:56.767 --> 49:00.687
I knew right then that she wasn't
gonna be a kid any longer.

49:03.524 --> 49:05.025
How old was Mickey when, uh...?

49:05.693 --> 49:08.028
Her mother died? Six.

49:09.905 --> 49:11.781
That should've been me.

49:12.783 --> 49:15.035
No kid should be without a mother.

49:18.372 --> 49:20.790
How did you handle all that by yourself?

49:23.044 --> 49:24.377
I didn't.

49:28.341 --> 49:29.799
How about you, Flanagan?

49:30.092 --> 49:33.678
Don't you feel like you're over your head,
handling a number one pick?

49:35.056 --> 49:37.057
I've been doing okay so far.

49:37.892 --> 49:39.851
Besides, you're here. I'll be fine.

49:40.728 --> 49:43.396
This isn't exactly what you wanted to do,
is it?

49:49.070 --> 49:53.907
After my arm went, the Red Sox gave me a
chance to, uh, you know, stay in the game.

49:54.909 --> 49:58.411
There's gonna be a job in the booth
next year, and I'm gunning for it.

49:58.579 --> 49:59.913
Announcing, huh?

50:01.457 --> 50:02.624
Yes, Gus.

50:02.833 --> 50:06.127
I plan on bringing all that hard work
and dedication I had as an athlete...

50:06.337 --> 50:08.088
to my profession as a broadcaster.

50:13.427 --> 50:16.888
Ever think what would've happened
if the Braves hadn't traded you?

50:20.601 --> 50:23.103
No more than eight, nine hours a day.

50:25.106 --> 50:26.147
Yeah.

50:27.608 --> 50:29.442
Never goes away, does it?

50:31.362 --> 50:32.737
No, it doesn't.

50:43.249 --> 50:44.749
God Almighty, Gus.

50:44.917 --> 50:46.459
What happened?

50:47.962 --> 50:49.212
Cut myself shaving.

50:50.631 --> 50:52.215
What are you fellas staring at?

50:52.758 --> 50:54.134
I'm not a pole dancer.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.187
What you doing with hot dogs?

51:06.397 --> 51:08.148
I couldn't hold out any longer.

51:08.315 --> 51:09.691
One of those for me?

51:09.900 --> 51:11.025
Nope.

51:32.631 --> 51:34.340
Good job, Bo.

51:40.681 --> 51:43.975
Yeah, there's one more game.
We'll watch it and then make our decision.

51:44.143 --> 51:47.395
- You think the Sox are gonna pass?
- How the hell should I know?

51:47.563 --> 51:49.689
Try and get a sense
of what they're gonna do.

51:49.857 --> 51:51.816
I'll get that, Mom.

51:51.984 --> 51:54.277
Yeah, I'll see what I can do on that.

51:55.196 --> 51:57.197
Dad, I'm starving.

51:57.364 --> 52:00.533
I gotta hang up now. Mickey and I
are gonna get something to eat.

52:00.701 --> 52:02.619
She still there?

52:02.787 --> 52:05.663
Yeah, she's here.
She's just, you know, sightseeing.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.344
He's a monster.

52:19.512 --> 52:21.513
Three for three, two homers and a single.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.307
We could be looking
at the next Albert Pujols.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.227
Oh, my God, I want this pick.

52:27.394 --> 52:31.189
Maybe the Red Sox are on the fence,
we do a draft and trade deal.

52:31.524 --> 52:34.192
Just make sure Grandpa
doesn't screw it up, all right?

52:34.360 --> 52:37.821
- He's got some young babe with him.
- Wow.

52:37.988 --> 52:40.907
I'm surprised he can still get it up.

52:41.534 --> 52:44.244
- All right, keep me posted.
- You got it.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.040
It was Mississippi.

52:49.208 --> 52:51.459
No, I know it was Mobile, Alabama.

52:51.627 --> 52:55.463
They had one of those promotion nights
where they had a horse out on the field.

52:55.631 --> 52:58.925
They had one of the players
race the horse around the bags.

52:59.093 --> 53:00.885
That's right, and the player won.

53:01.053 --> 53:03.263
You almost gave me a heart attack.

53:03.430 --> 53:04.430
How?

53:04.598 --> 53:07.934
Well, you kept pestering me
about getting up on the horse.

53:08.102 --> 53:10.728
And the horse ran off,
right out over center field.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.940
I thought it was gonna go through
the center field fence.

53:14.817 --> 53:16.150
I loved that horse.

53:16.318 --> 53:17.902
Yeah, I know you did.

53:18.904 --> 53:23.116
And then you went back looking for him
and he wasn't there.

53:25.828 --> 53:26.995
What? What is it?

53:27.162 --> 53:31.624
Nothing.
It was just a long time ago, that's all.

53:31.792 --> 53:33.751
- Here, I got it.
- No, I got it.

53:33.919 --> 53:36.129
Dad, I've got it.
Let me help, that's why I'm here.

53:36.297 --> 53:37.964
No, I got it!

53:47.474 --> 53:48.641
Night.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.493
- Hey, Greg.
- Mickey.

54:08.162 --> 54:11.164
If it wasn't for your assistant, I wouldn't
have known you were out of town.

54:11.832 --> 54:16.628
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I meant to call
you, I just had a lot going on up here.

54:17.588 --> 54:23.843
I just want you to know
I've been thinking about us...

54:24.011 --> 54:28.431
and I am really clear that I want this
to go to the next level.

54:28.599 --> 54:32.185
So, basically, I just need to know
that you're feeling the same way.

54:33.020 --> 54:35.688
Greg, I can't answer that right now.

54:37.107 --> 54:38.149
That's the problem.

54:38.317 --> 54:41.110
It doesn't feel like you can ever
give me an answer.

54:42.029 --> 54:46.324
This isn't one of those things
that you can just put on paper.

54:48.118 --> 54:51.788
Well, I guess that's my answer.

54:53.374 --> 54:54.999
You, uh...

54:55.167 --> 54:56.709
You take care, Mickey.

55:15.771 --> 55:18.022
You could buy me a drink if you want.

55:22.653 --> 55:23.903
You have got to lighten up.

55:24.780 --> 55:26.155
Seriously.

55:26.824 --> 55:29.575
I don't feel so light right now.

55:29.743 --> 55:31.661
- Get out.
- What?

55:31.829 --> 55:33.246
Go.

55:33.414 --> 55:36.666
Why don't you two go out,
meet some people? Have some fun.

55:36.834 --> 55:38.459
You don't want to hang around here.

55:38.627 --> 55:42.380
- Thank you. I meet plenty of people.
- Well, you're still single, aren't you?

55:42.548 --> 55:46.676
- Yes, I'm still single, very single.
- Maybe you are emotionally unavailable.

55:48.429 --> 55:49.554
Emotionally unavailable?

55:49.722 --> 55:51.222
- Yeah.
- Who are you, Dr. Phil?

55:51.390 --> 55:53.016
Hey, that is quality television.

55:53.183 --> 55:54.225
Yeah.

55:54.393 --> 55:56.519
By the way,
if I am emotionally unavailable...

55:56.687 --> 55:59.772
which I am not, thank you very much,
it would be because of you.

55:59.940 --> 56:01.190
Just go, will you?

56:01.358 --> 56:02.400
- No.
- Jesus Christ.

56:02.568 --> 56:04.986
We gotta get a camera crew
to follow you guys around.

56:05.154 --> 56:08.614
I mean, the Kardashians
have nothing on the two of you.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.199
Wow, that poor Bruce.

56:10.367 --> 56:11.617
Come on. Will you, please?

56:12.745 --> 56:14.954
Just the two of you, get out.

56:29.636 --> 56:30.970
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:31.138 --> 56:32.513
Name a team...

56:32.681 --> 56:36.893
to have four 20-game winners
in the same season. Go.

56:37.561 --> 56:40.063
'71 Orioles: Palmer, McNally...

56:40.230 --> 56:43.316
Cuellar and Dobson, they lose
to the Pirates in the series. Go figure.

56:43.484 --> 56:45.902
Ugh! You've got to be kidding me.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.321
- Have you had enough?
- Mm-mm.

56:48.489 --> 56:51.032
No, no, no. Fire away. Come on.

56:51.200 --> 56:52.450
Okay, uh, '75 World Series...

56:52.618 --> 56:56.329
Carlton Fisk hits a homer
to win the game, right?

56:56.497 --> 57:01.084
What was the player who hit a homer to tie
the game and take it into extra innings?

57:01.251 --> 57:02.919
Ugh.

57:03.087 --> 57:04.128
The three-two pitch.

57:05.506 --> 57:07.298
This one's hit deep to center, way back.

57:07.466 --> 57:10.676
Way back.
This baby's got a chance. It's gone.

57:10.844 --> 57:13.471
Home run.
Bernie Carbo has just tied the game.

57:14.848 --> 57:16.682
Bernie Carbo has just tied the game.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.185
- Very good.
- All right, that's... Yeah.

57:21.146 --> 57:22.355
You're actually very good.

57:22.523 --> 57:25.566
You're really very good.
You sound like the real thing.

57:25.734 --> 57:28.653
- Let's hope the Red Sox agree with you.
- I would listen to you.

57:28.821 --> 57:29.946
- Really?
- Really.

57:30.989 --> 57:33.825
Who's the only player to be named
MVP in both leagues?

57:34.785 --> 57:38.204
Frank Robinson.
Baltimore and Cincinnati.

57:38.372 --> 57:39.455
That was too easy.

57:39.623 --> 57:42.125
- It was really, really easy, actually.
- Shit.

57:42.584 --> 57:43.918
Mm.

57:44.086 --> 57:45.711
Who was he traded for?

57:45.879 --> 57:49.257
Milt Pappas, but if we're going to be
specific, Baldschun and Simpson.

57:49.424 --> 57:50.466
Drink up.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.135
Who are you?

57:54.138 --> 57:57.557
- I see what's happening here.
- I'm kicking your ass is what's happening.

57:57.724 --> 58:00.476
Well, maybe.

58:00.644 --> 58:03.729
I mean, you're trying to get me drunk.
You're hoping to get lucky.

58:03.897 --> 58:05.898
Really? Heh.

58:14.992 --> 58:16.409
Um...

58:16.910 --> 58:18.786
Too much moonshine?
What are they doing?

58:18.954 --> 58:19.996
Clogging.

58:20.956 --> 58:22.373
- Clogging?
- Clogging. Clogging.

58:22.541 --> 58:25.251
- It's a mountain dance. No?
- No.

58:25.419 --> 58:27.795
Where I'm from, they'd take you
to a psych ward for that.

58:27.963 --> 58:29.589
No, actually, it's a...

58:29.756 --> 58:30.840
I think you'd like it.

58:31.758 --> 58:33.384
It's really fun. You should try it.

58:33.552 --> 58:34.886
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yes.

58:35.053 --> 58:36.929
- No.
- Come on, it's fun. It's really fun.

58:37.097 --> 58:38.764
- No.
- It's really fun. Come on.

58:38.932 --> 58:41.350
I'll deny this ever happened.

58:42.269 --> 58:43.728
Just try to keep up.

58:52.237 --> 58:54.906
Hop up and down, they'll think
you know what you're doing.

58:55.073 --> 58:56.282
Okay.

59:00.078 --> 59:02.371
I think we're going in a circle.

59:03.999 --> 59:05.082
Oh, yeah!

59:06.293 --> 59:10.213
You're good at this. I don't believe you,
I think you clog all the time.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.594
Just keep bouncing, just bounce.

59:16.762 --> 59:19.472
I think I got it now. I got it.

59:25.312 --> 59:29.190
Yeah, it was, uh,
my first start after being called up.

59:31.026 --> 59:33.069
God. There's nothing like it.

59:33.403 --> 59:35.071
I mean, it's Fenway.

59:35.530 --> 59:38.741
As I'm walking out to the mound,
all I could think about was...

59:38.909 --> 59:41.577
all the legends that had played
there before, you know?

59:41.745 --> 59:42.954
How'd you do?

59:43.455 --> 59:45.665
Went six and a third, three earned.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.583
First start, that's awesome.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.919
Well, that's the best it got.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.922
We needed middle relief help.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.465
So they used me...

59:55.008 --> 59:56.300
a lot.

59:56.718 --> 59:58.719
My arm got tired...

59:58.887 --> 01:00:00.513
didn't say anything.

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:02.765
Ended up tearing my rotator.

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:05.309
That was it. What are you gonna do?

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:07.645
Why didn't you say anything?

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:13.192
Because I was afraid if I did,
they'd find somebody else.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.445
I'm sorry.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.784
So, what's Mickey short for? Michelle?

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:24.161
Heh. Mickey is short for Mickey.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:26.580
As in Mickey Mantle,
my father's favourite player.

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:28.457
Aha.

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:31.252
Lucky it wasn't Yogi Berra.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.673
Shit, I'm sorry.

01:00:37.175 --> 01:00:38.759
Jealous boyfriend?

01:00:38.927 --> 01:00:40.594
No, this thing is all work, no play.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:44.682
There's no available space
for jealous boyfriends.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:50.062
You want to tell me
what's wrong with Gus?

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:52.398
You can trust me.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:54.150
Okay?

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:58.029
When Gus scouted me,
we spent a lot of time together.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:02.742
To be honest, when I got traded, I think
it bothered him as much as it did me.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.372
Actually, I remember him saying
he had a daughter in college.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.249
Yep.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:14.295
He would say that she was smarter
than me and him put together.

01:01:15.047 --> 01:01:19.216
That's why when I met you, obviously,
I thought Gus had another daughter.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.513
Doesn't sound like my father.
That sounds like a compliment.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.182
Well, he said it.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.517
Well, he never tells me anything.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:29.894
Maybe he wants to.

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:33.689
You know? Doesn't know how.
You might have to take the lead.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:36.525
Trust me, I've tried. I'm done.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:39.528
As you know...

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:44.450
to hit the magical 300,
you fail seven out of ten times.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:49.246
You think you're pretty smart.

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:51.332
- Me? No.
- Yeah, you.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:56.295
- What, that a good thing? You like smart?
- Well, you gotta have it here, and here.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:57.588
Here and here?

01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:59.465
Yes, here and here.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:03.135
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty much
what you're looking for then.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:12.436
I come home early in the evening.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.106
Lie around some time.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:20.486
Little girl's got everything I want.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:23.989
Looking and smelling so fine

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:27.910
it's a good night for dancing.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:30.830
Yeah. Heh.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:33.999
Yeah, we've done some dancing. Heh.
If you can call it that.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.543
Don't be shy.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.755
Ahem. Well, you heard the man.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.508
Make a move on me.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:45.469
Okay, come on. Come on.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.985
I'm so sorry.
I'm having a good time, but...

01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:04.572
- What's wrong?
- It's this thing, I just...

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.282
I need to go.

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:09.994
Wow. You were not kidding.

01:03:10.162 --> 01:03:11.996
You really have no available space.

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:14.957
Is all this by design?

01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:18.544
It is way too late
to get into that right now.

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:21.964
Yeah, okay.

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:24.049
I'll take you home.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.401
You trying to starve me to death?

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.446
Come on, let's go get something to eat.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.033
You got a man in there?

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:53.746
Yeah, Flanagan's in here.
We're getting ready to get in the shower.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.294
Not so funny.

01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:05.799
What the hell happened in here,
anyway?

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:07.009
Work.

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:14.099
Okay. There you go. You're good.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.769
You kids all right?

01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:19.021
Yeah. Just fine.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.026
You wouldn't happen to know what
the state bird of New Jersey is, would you?

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:28.614
That'd be a trick question.
There are no birds in New Jersey.

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:32.201
That's good.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.375
You're leaving a lot of good food
unattended there.

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:47.967
Do you know what, um, therapy is?

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:50.886
What?

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.389
Therapy.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:59.186
I've been going since college.
It's a long time.

01:05:01.273 --> 01:05:05.818
Just needed to talk to someone
to help me deal with why you left me.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.904
Did I say something wrong here?

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:16.036
I just needed to, um, understand
why after mom died...

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:20.874
you took a 6-year-old to live
with an uncle that she barely knew...

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:25.671
and you left her there for a year
and you didn't even call, not once.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:30.634
We came here to watch baseball.
We didn't come here to...

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:32.553
Talk. I know.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.931
Everything is okay
as long as we don't talk.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.976
But there's no TV
and there's no game on, so...

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.688
- it's just you and me.
- I need a check here.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.356
And then you did it again.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:48.360
I had you until I was 13,
until you sent me away to boarding school.

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:49.778
And then nothing.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.405
You were gone.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:54.533
Middle school, high school,
college, nothing.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:57.536
For a long time,
I thought I had done something wrong...

01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:59.997
and that's why you left.

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:03.959
But then I figured out that's how you
wanted it, so I acted like it was okay...

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:07.046
because I didn't want you
to know how bad it hurt.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.548
This is not the time or place
to talk about this.

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:11.425
Are you kidding?

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:13.886
There's never a time or place.

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:17.056
What are you doing, anyway?
Why did you start all this?

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:22.853
You're amazing.

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:30.235
Give me a check.

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:34.823
Get me a goddamn check.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:43.248
So I hear the old man has a girlfriend
in North Carolina, a young one.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.209
What the hell are you talking about?

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:48.045
Nelson says he's got a pretty
little baby helping him out.

01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:50.589
What's Matt Nelson doing
in Gus's territory?

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:53.384
They sent him down there.
Make sure everything's all right.

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:56.220
Confirm that Bo Gentry's our choice
if he's available.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:06:59.640
Listen.

01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:04.019
That babe is Gus' daughter
and she's not helping out, she's visiting.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.896
The hell's going on, Pete?

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:10.109
Can't have the daughter of one of our scouts
impacting an important Braves decision.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.528
You're a real team player,
aren't you, Phillip?

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:14.822
It's just business. Don't
take it so personal.

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:17.908
I'm not after your job
because I want director of scouting.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:22.121
I'm after your job because I want to be
the G.M. You know how it is.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:24.873
Get the hell out of my office.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:40.681
Nice shot.

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:43.434
- Uh, I got the Landau research.
- Oh.

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:47.646
I agree with Mickey there's precedent,
I don't think it's our strongest position.

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.565
I've outlined my approach a bit different.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:54.987
I know you have a hard deadline for the
presentation, so I'm here if you need me.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:56.155
It's priority.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.866
Why, I appreciate that, Todd.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.368
It, uh...

01:08:02.036 --> 01:08:03.912
won't go unnoticed.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.753
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen...

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.297
and welcome
to Asheville's Zeb B. Vance Field...

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:17.426
the site of the Mountain County
Championship game...

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:22.514
between your Swannanoa Grizzlies
and the Devils of Morganton.

01:08:26.478 --> 01:08:28.103
There you go, darling.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.192
That'll be a collector's item
so don't go selling that on the internet.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.694
It's the two best teams
in the Mountain County League...

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:39.363
Well, the last game.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.701
- Hope it's a good one.
- Yep.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:43.911
Play ball!

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:46.371
Pack up and get you back to Atlanta.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:48.957
For sure.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:59.218
There they are. My two favourite people
in the entire state of North Carolina.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.970
Well, good to see you.

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:06.683
Hey, did you get your work done?

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.310
Some of it.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.897
Good. I had a nice time.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.817
Who knew I was such a clogger?

01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:23.742
Now batting, number three...

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:26.495
Bo Gentry!

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:45.305
Off-speed. Right?

01:09:47.267 --> 01:09:50.894
Do you mind getting your beak
out of that thing? I'm blind, you know.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:54.231
Got it.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.493
Did you hear that?

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:07.953
No, what?

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:11.665
- That was a breaking ball, right?
- Yeah.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:14.626
Ha. Son of a bitch. Heh.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.212
Can't handle a breaking ball.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.298
How can you tell?

01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:22.885
- Did you see a hitch in his swing?
- No.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:28.515
If you can get down there next time he's
up, I want you to keep an eye on him.

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:31.018
See how he handles that breaking ball.

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:40.903
Come on, now. This is it.
Let's bring this one home to Swannanoa.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:42.487
Wilson.

01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:48.952
You better get your skinny little ass
on base.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.914
I got a chance to win this game
in front of all these scouts.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:55.417
I'm visualizing mega endorsement deals.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.628
Do not mess this up.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:01.465
I'll do my best, Bo.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.845
Oh, dear God, let me get a hit.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:11.350
Now batting, number 12, Wyatt Wilson.

01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:15.604
One pitch at a time.

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:20.859
You got it, Wyatt!

01:11:23.655 --> 01:11:24.696
Take your base!

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:27.658
Come on, ump, what the heck's going on?

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.329
Guess you misunderstood me.

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:36.291
Next up, Bo Gentry!

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:56.061
All right, let's see how
you handle the hook.

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:23.255
That's my boy! That's right!

01:12:39.439 --> 01:12:41.565
And the Swannanoa Grizzlies...

01:12:41.733 --> 01:12:44.735
are the champions
of the Mountain County League.

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:50.115
Congratulations to both teams
for an exciting and excellent game.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:56.955
You were right.

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:58.790
His hands drift.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.794
How did you know that
if you can't see him?

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:06.757
Because I've been in this business
too damn long, that's why.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:09.426
No, it's more than that. Tell me.

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.221
It's the sound you hear.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:17.559
It's like a ball coming off the bat,
or exploding into a glove.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:21.188
It's a pure sound.
You'll know it when you hear it.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:26.943
So, what do you think?

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:30.197
You make a number of key arguments.
It's provoking.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:33.116
Well, I'll be back tomorrow afternoon
to present to the client.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:38.080
Uh, no need to rush back.
Uh, you can take off the rest of the week.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.623
Excuse me?

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:42.793
Mickey, we didn't know how serious
this was going to be with your father.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.546
So to ensure the firm's best interests
were protected...

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:49.216
we had Todd draft a resolution.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:50.425
What?

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:54.513
He's gonna take the case from here,
so, look, enjoy a few more days.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.848
- Come back rested.
- Rested?

01:13:57.975 --> 01:14:01.520
This isn't a vacation.
I've worked my ass off on this case.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.522
No one would dispute that.

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:06.274
You bring boot-licking Todd on
and you don't tell me?

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:09.319
- Mickey, it's not personal.
- Of course, it's personal.

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:13.698
- Todd's just being a team player.
- Yeah, that's being a team player.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:16.034
How does this affect my partnership?

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:17.953
To be determined.

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:21.206
A conversation we all want to continue.
You're a quality associate.

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:25.961
Now I'm a quality associate, I see. Um...

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:30.632
I've worked longer and harder than
anyone in that office. I deserve this.

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:36.680
You'll have your time, Mickey.
Just, uh, maybe not now.

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:41.685
All right, um...

01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:45.897
I will see you all next week,
rested and ready to work.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.076
It's my problem.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:02.247
I don't know why I give my blood,
sweat and tears to those cold-blooded...

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.791
backstabbing jerk-offs.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.044
And for what?

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:13.341
I guess, you know,
you want your name on the door.

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.596
Hmm.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:28.398
Where'd you learn how to drink, uh,
fancy single-malt out of the bottle?

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:31.193
- They teach you that at law school?
- No.

01:15:31.903 --> 01:15:36.573
My dad. Yet another brilliant gift
he bestowed upon me.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:47.959
You are my sunshine.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.212
My only sunshine.

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:56.468
You make me happy
When skies are gray.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:02.265
My dad used to sing that when, uh...

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:06.686
When we were low,
and he would sing that and...

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:08.897
it would help.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:13.944
You have his voice.

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:23.912
What do you think, Flanagan,
about your first pick?

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:28.458
Uh, I don't know. What do you think?

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:31.002
I just got off the phone with Atlanta.

01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:33.672
We're not gonna take him
because he can't hit a curve.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:36.341
The last homer he hit was off a curve.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.134
Tell him.

01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:41.846
His hands drift.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.227
He can't get any punch into a breaking ball
because his hands are just drifting.

01:16:47.395 --> 01:16:48.770
Well, he still hit it out.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.690
Sisters of the Blind could hit it out
with an aluminum bat.

01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:55.151
From everything the Red Sox
have heard...

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:57.862
they think we're drafting
the next Albert Pujols.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:00.657
Well, just take my advice
and be careful.

01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:05.537
You're sure? Not even as a project?

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:09.207
You'd waste a number one pick
on a project?

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:13.503
If you wanna cover your ass, okay,
but I sure as hell wouldn't do that.

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:16.965
It's not every day you get
a number one pick.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:20.343
That's true, but let me give you
another piece of advice.

01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.637
Don't be afraid to walk away.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:24.806
Go ahead and do what you like,
Flanagan.

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:28.768
If he's available, he's not gonna be playing
for the Braves, I'll tell you that.

01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:35.233
Think he's right?

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:37.527
I don't know.

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:41.906
What's the matter with you? You okay?

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:45.535
Yeah. I'm just thinking, a lot, too much.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.163
- Too much thinking.
- Okay.

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:52.125
That's enough, we're gonna get out of here.
Come on.

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:54.753
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.921
You'll figure it out when we get there.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.840
- Come on.
- Do I need my shoes?

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:00.884
You can bring them if you want.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.614
You want something from him...

01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:25.784
that he just may not
be able to give you.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:29.788
So do yourself a favor,
stop being pissed off about it.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:36.461
What?

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:39.130
You're not so bad, Flanagan.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:56.606
Wow.

01:18:58.109 --> 01:19:00.735
That's all right. I'll wait.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:04.614
How long?

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:09.661
As long as it takes.

01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:21.047
What are you doing?

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:23.508
What am I doing?
I'm taking my clothes off.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:31.433
What?

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:39.023
Let's go.

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.526
You are crazy.

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:47.323
Aah! Ha, ha.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.664
You coming in?

01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:57.917
Oh, no. No, no, no, I don't think so. Heh.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:01.880
Afraid you might forget about your job
for a second and actually have some fun?

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:05.800
Oh, thank you for the analysis.
How much do I owe you?

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:07.552
That one was pro bono.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.721
Oh, thanks.

01:20:09.889 --> 01:20:11.514
Come on.

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:13.224
Live a little.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.900
No peeking.

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:30.992
What're you staring at?

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.661
The paint job on the car.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.038
Oh, yeah, you like it?

01:20:35.206 --> 01:20:36.748
Really hot paint job.

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:39.667
- Yeah.
- Really hot.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.964
What? Oh, uh-oh. Here she goes.

01:20:45.132 --> 01:20:46.257
Whoo!

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:50.178
Whew.

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:52.931
Wow.

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:55.350
- A cannonball.
- Yeah, you like that?

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.519
- Yeah, it's impressive.
- Thank you.

01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:01.648
Isn't this beautiful?

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.234
Yeah, it sure is.

01:21:12.743 --> 01:21:14.077
Where are you going?

01:21:14.954 --> 01:21:17.205
I'm keeping a safe distance.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.583
You're good at that, you know?

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:22.919
Why don't you try stopping?

01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:26.381
Here.

01:21:30.678 --> 01:21:31.719
How's this?

01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:35.223
It's safe.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:38.726
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:44.899
What about now?

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:48.069
Safe.

01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:19.350
This makes me nervous, Johnny.

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:25.857
Are you sure they're passing?
How well do you know Gus Lobel?

01:22:26.025 --> 01:22:28.985
Trust me, we go back a long way.
Okay? He's a friend.

01:22:29.153 --> 01:22:30.903
Three minutes to make the pick.

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:33.990
Look, I could play this safe
and tell you to take him.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:36.868
But you don't want to do that.
The kid's hands drift.

01:22:37.036 --> 01:22:40.538
The truth is, I didn't even see it,
Lobel did.

01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:42.707
You better be sure
you understood him correctly.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:45.418
I'm sure.

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:47.670
Welcome back to Major League Baseball's...

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:50.214
live coverage of the
first-year player draft.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:52.342
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:56.429
High school, college students from across
the country have worked hard all year...

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:58.598
and it all comes down to this.

01:22:58.766 --> 01:22:59.891
Here we go.

01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:03.311
Okay, so it's time to find out.
Let's head to the podium.

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:05.855
Oh, my God.

01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:08.024
Good evening.

01:23:08.192 --> 01:23:12.153
With the first selection
of the first year player draft...

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.238
the Boston Red Sox select...

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:19.494
Paulino Estrada, a right-handed pitcher
from Arizona State University.

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:21.287
Yes! Come on, baby.

01:23:21.455 --> 01:23:23.539
Gentry's ours, Red Sox pass!

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:26.834
The Atlanta Braves have the
next pick and they are now on the clock.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.044
Congratulations.

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:31.255
The Red Sox. So stupid.

01:23:32.758 --> 01:23:36.052
The Sox passed
because Flanagan's smart, that's why.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:40.098
Like I told you last night,
kid can't hit a curve ball.

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:43.434
You know how I feel about you,
but God Almighty, if you're wrong...

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:47.814
Well, I'm not wrong.
Kid's nothing but a dead-red hitter.

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:51.359
Oh, you can watch him if you want
and see if he develops...

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:52.902
but no more than that.

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:56.030
I'll see you back in Atlanta in a few days.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:02.912
Don't sign him.

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:06.457
- What?
- Gus is adamant. He can't hit the curve.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:11.003
Oh, Christ! How long?
How long are we gonna listen to this?

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:13.631
I don't give a damn.
We've been tracking him.

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:16.175
Matt says he can hit the crap
out of anything.

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:17.427
This kid's a godsend.

01:24:20.013 --> 01:24:21.139
- Pete?
- I stand with Gus.

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:23.099
I say sign the pitcher from San Diego.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:25.017
We are not passing on him, Vince.

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:27.979
Last time I checked, that's my decision.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.315
Yes. No, I'm sorry. It's just...

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.985
I've been following this kid...

01:24:34.153 --> 01:24:37.238
- every game, every single bat.
- Your computer's followed him.

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:40.992
When's the last time you stepped out
of the office and saw a high school game?

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.453
Our pick's up in two minutes.

01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:47.790
If I am wrong, if I'm wrong, you fire me.

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:49.667
But I am telling you right now:

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:54.005
Bo Gentry's the kind of five-tool player that
changes the entire landscape of a franchise.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:58.217
We draft this kid and we are competitive
for the next five, 10 years.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.149
Sorry, Pete.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:22.200
- You better be right.
- I'm right.

01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:24.285
Definitely right.

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:39.133
Did it even occur to you
that I might get fired?

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:41.135
- You just don't care.
- What happened?

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:42.845
That's funny. Learn to walk away?

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:45.848
Isn't that what you said?
Yeah, well, I did. I walked away.

01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:48.851
I passed and you guys got Gentry.
Congratulations.

01:25:49.019 --> 01:25:50.228
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:53.981
You did the right thing, Flanagan. I guess
the Braves don't give a crap what I think.

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:55.399
Honestly, Gus, save it.

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:57.401
Whoa, hold on. Johnny, it wasn't us.

01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:58.820
- Really?
- Really. It wasn't.

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:02.073
- It's the truth.
- The truth? Oh, okay.

01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:04.200
Well, the truth is, it's over for me.

01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:07.787
I had a real shot at the booth,
and now it's gone.

01:26:07.955 --> 01:26:10.581
Okay, well, that wasn't us.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:14.919
You can drop the act, Mickey,
I feel dumb enough already, okay?

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:16.796
You know, I should've known better.

01:26:16.964 --> 01:26:20.216
A lawyer and a washed-up baseball player.

01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:24.428
Look, you have to believe me. Last night
meant more to me than you know.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.013
Get out of the way, Mickey.

01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:31.561
This is a bad time to walk away now.

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:33.604
Move.

01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:35.690
No.

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:37.733
Move!

01:26:40.571 --> 01:26:41.612
Let him go.

01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:07.889
Well...

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:13.144
I guess now I go into a life of retirement
for all the good service I've given them.

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:16.355
Always use another watch.

01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:19.066
I should've seen it earlier.

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:21.027
No, it wasn't your fault.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:26.198
Phillip Sanderson sent that guy up here
to make sure I didn't screw it all up.

01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:28.826
Well, things are definitely screwed up.

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:32.288
So, what do we do now?

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:33.873
Go home.

01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:39.337
Me, to a career ending, and you to
a career that's just starting as a partner.

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:41.839
I don't think so.

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:43.925
What?

01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:47.470
It was more important
that I be here. It's, I...

01:27:47.638 --> 01:27:49.138
- No.
- No, it's all right.

01:27:49.306 --> 01:27:51.432
- No.
- No, I'll deal with it.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.642
No.

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:56.520
God, I worked my ass off
so you could have more, and you...

01:27:56.688 --> 01:28:00.191
You're gonna throw it away
on coming to a garbage can like this?

01:28:00.359 --> 01:28:02.777
- That's no life for a...
- For a girl.

01:28:02.945 --> 01:28:04.528
That's no life for a kid of mine.

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:09.617
Living out of suitcases and visiting
every shit-ball town in the area.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.453
That's not what I wanted for my kid.

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:15.039
Well, I guess what I wanted didn't matter.

01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:19.710
- You don't even like baseball.
- I love baseball.

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:22.129
You know I love it.
I never wanted to be a lawyer.

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:24.882
I did that for you so that you
would be happy with me...

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:28.719
and that you would approve of me
and then maybe you'd keep me around.

01:28:31.264 --> 01:28:33.432
I did what I felt was right.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.143
I just didn't want you to have life
in the cheap seats.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.270
They weren't the cheap seats.

01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:41.691
Spending every waking moment
with my dad watching baseball...

01:28:41.858 --> 01:28:43.985
eating food that was no good for me.

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:47.738
Playing pool, staying up too late,
those were the best seats in the house...

01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:49.615
until you sent me away.

01:28:49.783 --> 01:28:52.910
Well, I was just doing the best I know how.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:54.745
Only a coward leaves their kid.

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.416
You don't know half
of what you think you do.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:01.794
Okay, then tell me the other half.

01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:04.422
Goddamn it, Dad, talk to me.

01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:08.759
Dad...

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:10.845
talk to me.

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:13.681
Please.

01:29:24.651 --> 01:29:28.320
You remember years ago,
down in Mobile, Alabama...

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:30.614
they had the horse
running around the field.

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:31.824
Yeah.

01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:36.537
They used to keep that horse in a trailer
down outside the bullpen gate.

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:41.375
Anyway, I was talking to this kid
I had signed...

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:45.629
telling him there's no place for him
in the big leagues.

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:49.800
And all of a sudden I realized
you were gone and I couldn't find you.

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:50.968
I was panicking.

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:53.804
I saw this shack there.

01:29:58.852 --> 01:29:59.894
I went...

01:30:01.188 --> 01:30:02.563
I went over and looked in...

01:30:04.775 --> 01:30:06.484
and there you were with this guy.

01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:09.320
He had his hand
down the back of your shirt.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:12.156
I don't remember that.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:15.910
Yeah. How could you?
You were only 6 years old.

01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:23.042
I sent you out, and then I started
beating the shit out of this guy.

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:28.172
I smashed his head against the wall and I
started hitting him with everything I had.

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:33.052
I strangled his ass.

01:30:33.220 --> 01:30:35.513
Finally, he passed out.

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:38.641
Oh, my gosh, Dad.

01:30:38.809 --> 01:30:43.354
I kept waiting for the police to come
and arrest me, but they never did.

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:47.942
That's when I sent you to your aunt and
uncle's. I thought they'd take care of you.

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:50.694
I thought I'd failed you.

01:30:50.862 --> 01:30:53.489
Your mother had died a year before
and I was a mess.

01:30:53.657 --> 01:30:56.117
You have to understand that.

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:01.872
Can't you understand that you
sending me away wasn't protecting me...

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.207
it was rejecting me.

01:31:05.502 --> 01:31:09.213
I've been working hard to not let anyone
else get close enough to do that again.

01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:11.382
And being alone really sucks.

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.011
Well...

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:22.184
you might just have to give me
a little slack on that, because...

01:31:22.352 --> 01:31:24.353
I just can't change.

01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:28.357
You never tried.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:39.910
I'm just a broken-down old man.

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:48.335
And you ought to get as far away
from me as you can.

01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:51.505
Can't you just do that?

01:31:57.888 --> 01:31:58.929
Yeah.

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:02.266
I can do that.

01:32:29.419 --> 01:32:30.461
Grace?

01:32:31.671 --> 01:32:32.796
Do you know where he is?

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.966
Oh, he left. Checked out
early this morning.

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:39.887
Thanks.

01:32:41.306 --> 01:32:42.723
Is he all right?

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:45.226
He said he wanted to take the bus.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:48.395
What happened with you two?

01:32:49.606 --> 01:32:50.648
Nothing.

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:53.984
It's all good.

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:56.195
Thanks, Pete.

01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:43.260
I gotta stop.

01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:48.932
Hi. I'm Mickey.

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.060
I've been watching,
it's really impressive.

01:34:51.227 --> 01:34:52.728
Thank you.

01:34:52.896 --> 01:34:55.105
You're welcome. Mind if I try?

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:00.110
I can handle it, I think.

01:35:01.988 --> 01:35:03.447
Are you crazy?

01:35:04.699 --> 01:35:06.450
Probably.

01:35:06.826 --> 01:35:08.077
Can I borrow your glove?

01:35:17.504 --> 01:35:19.963
- Throw me that fastball.
- Okay.

01:35:26.971 --> 01:35:28.555
Is that your favourite pitch?

01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:31.266
Sorry?

01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:34.103
Can you throw a curve?

01:35:35.105 --> 01:35:36.146
Yes.

01:35:36.773 --> 01:35:39.358
- Show me.
- Okay.

01:35:57.544 --> 01:35:58.585
Oh, my God.

01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:00.587
Do it again.

01:36:15.937 --> 01:36:17.354
What's your name?

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:20.065
Rigoberto. They call me Rigo.

01:36:20.233 --> 01:36:21.942
Rigo. You play in school, Rigo?

01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:24.862
No, ma'am. Never had the grades
to suit my mom.

01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:26.947
Kept getting B's in Chemistry.

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:31.034
Well, thank God for Chemistry.
You gonna be around here for a bit?

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:32.661
Yes, ma'am.

01:36:32.829 --> 01:36:35.706
Okay. Wait here, all right?

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:40.085
Mickey, I just can't do it.
This isn't an open tryout.

01:36:40.253 --> 01:36:43.714
I've seen him.
I swear to you, he's the real thing.

01:36:43.882 --> 01:36:45.340
There's no paperwork on the kid.

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:49.219
I just can't parade him out on the field
and let him pitch.

01:36:49.387 --> 01:36:52.723
I'm here because of you, Pete, okay,
so I don't care what you have to do.

01:36:52.891 --> 01:36:55.893
You gotta make this happen, okay?
You owe me.

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:04.568
Well, you can take an early retirement,
collect disability.

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:06.737
With the pension,
you should be comfortable.

01:37:06.905 --> 01:37:09.698
Save it. Being comfortable's overrated.

01:37:09.866 --> 01:37:12.701
Thank God we sent Matt down there
or we would have missed on this kid.

01:37:12.869 --> 01:37:14.912
That kid can't hit a curve.

01:37:15.747 --> 01:37:18.582
Gus, now that we're all aware
of your condition...

01:37:19.042 --> 01:37:22.628
I can't help but ask,
how could you tell?

01:37:23.838 --> 01:37:24.880
I heard it.

01:37:26.508 --> 01:37:27.549
You heard it?

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:30.469
- That's right. And Mickey saw it.
- And Mickey saw it.

01:37:30.637 --> 01:37:33.263
- This is getting interesting.
- Damn right she saw it.

01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:36.141
Let me just get this straight.

01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:39.311
This year's pick was gonna
be based on what you heard...

01:37:39.479 --> 01:37:42.105
and what your daughter, a girl, saw?

01:37:42.273 --> 01:37:45.776
We need to go down to the field. Mickey's
brought us something we gotta see.

01:37:45.944 --> 01:37:48.445
Oh, boy, I can't wait to see
what Mickey brought us.

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:50.906
- Hey, you watch yourself.
- Let's go.

01:37:52.909 --> 01:37:55.953
- Hey, here he comes.
- Hey, Bo, how about a shot?

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120
Over here.

01:37:57.288 --> 01:37:58.956
Everything okay? Ah, nice.

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:01.458
- Hey, how's it going?
- Show's about to start.

01:38:01.626 --> 01:38:03.627
Great. Go for it, kid.

01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:11.426
Oh, yeah.

01:38:12.053 --> 01:38:13.095
Wow.

01:38:21.563 --> 01:38:23.105
Whoo!

01:38:26.985 --> 01:38:29.903
All right, let's show them what you got.

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:44.001
Oh, boy. He's got a nice swing.

01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:47.254
You got this.

01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:56.680
What the hell's going on?

01:38:56.848 --> 01:38:58.599
- I heard it.
- What?

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.892
The pure sound, I heard it.

01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:06.189
Come on. What is this?
We don't have all day.

01:39:07.066 --> 01:39:10.152
Gentlemen, this is Rigoberto Sanchez.

01:39:11.613 --> 01:39:12.988
Peanut Boy?

01:39:13.156 --> 01:39:15.782
Son of a bitch.

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:19.161
Ls this a joke?

01:39:19.329 --> 01:39:21.830
Y'all gonna waste my time on him?

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:25.375
- That's it. I've seen all I need to see.
- Just hold your ass right there.

01:39:29.839 --> 01:39:32.883
All right. This is gonna be ugly.

01:39:34.886 --> 01:39:36.678
Start with the fastball.

01:39:57.742 --> 01:39:58.992
You all right?

01:39:59.369 --> 01:40:00.410
Yes, ma'am.

01:40:01.079 --> 01:40:02.329
Nervous?

01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:04.706
No, ma'am. It's just a game.

01:40:08.211 --> 01:40:11.088
You're right, Rigo. It's just a game.

01:40:47.166 --> 01:40:48.875
He looks like Sandy Koufax.

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:51.670
Yep, combined with Steve Carlton
and Randy Johnson.

01:40:51.838 --> 01:40:53.463
And that's not even his best pitch.

01:40:54.215 --> 01:40:55.966
Show him a curve.

01:41:25.413 --> 01:41:27.080
Nobody saw this?

01:41:28.332 --> 01:41:31.668
Gentry's got potential,
but using our number one pick?

01:41:38.843 --> 01:41:40.093
Jesus Christ.

01:41:45.975 --> 01:41:48.435
Gentry knows it's coming,
he still can't hit it.

01:41:54.859 --> 01:41:55.901
Shit!

01:41:56.068 --> 01:41:58.320
Jesus Christ, who is this kid?

01:41:58.488 --> 01:42:01.198
What do you say now, jackass?

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:04.534
That's known as trouble with the curve.

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:10.916
Well, there's no doubt that Rigo Sanchez
should be offered a contract.

01:42:11.083 --> 01:42:12.459
You think? Heh.

01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:13.960
And he's gonna need an agent.

01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:15.295
He's got one.

01:42:16.005 --> 01:42:17.255
Mickey.

01:42:17.423 --> 01:42:20.884
She's a damn good lawyer and I'm sure
she can whip up some papers...

01:42:21.052 --> 01:42:23.887
- ...make that young man some money.
- Shit.

01:42:24.055 --> 01:42:25.847
Or she could have your job...

01:42:26.015 --> 01:42:29.476
because you sure as hell
don't know anything about the game.

01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:33.396
And if I'd have been any help,
she'd be managing her own club now...

01:42:33.564 --> 01:42:36.900
because she knows more about baseball
than anyone in this room.

01:42:37.610 --> 01:42:38.819
It's okay, Dad.

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:42.155
No. It's in my blood
and it's in your blood too.

01:42:43.366 --> 01:42:45.617
I want you to be happy, that's all.

01:42:51.165 --> 01:42:53.333
Here's the reports
from last night's game.

01:42:53.876 --> 01:42:54.960
What about you, Gus?

01:42:55.127 --> 01:42:58.588
Your contract's gonna be up.
Are you interested in an extension?

01:42:59.799 --> 01:43:01.174
I'll think about that.

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:04.427
- Anything you want. You name it.
- I said, I'll think about it.

01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:05.595
Unbelievable.

01:43:06.681 --> 01:43:08.723
Billy Clark went five-for-five again.

01:43:08.891 --> 01:43:12.227
He's been hitting close to 400
since his folks came to visit him.

01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:17.274
How much did it cost this organization to put
his parents up? That's what I want to know.

01:43:18.526 --> 01:43:19.860
Phillip...

01:43:20.403 --> 01:43:22.070
you're fired.

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:26.199
Vince, wait a... Wait a sec. I'm sorry.

01:43:26.367 --> 01:43:30.453
I know I missed with Gentry and I'm sorry
about that, but this is real life.

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:33.206
- We're gonna go get a little lunch.
- Yeah, I'm starving.

01:43:33.374 --> 01:43:37.502
I'll go to high school games. I like high school.
I mean, I just bought a boat.

01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:40.797
I've got private school.
I'll take you fishing.

01:43:44.427 --> 01:43:45.552
Well...

01:43:46.304 --> 01:43:50.849
I think maybe, maybe I could
change the way I do things.

01:43:51.017 --> 01:43:52.601
You already have.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.272
What would they want now?

01:43:57.732 --> 01:44:02.611
Hmm. Todd's presentation didn't go
so well, so they're trying to...
