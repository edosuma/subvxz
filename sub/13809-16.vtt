08:12.491 --> 08:13.117
I DIDN'T MAKE
THE TEAM, TWIST.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.912

THE ANCIENT HAWAIIANS
COULD NOT HAVE SAID IT BETTER.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.444
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:48.527 --> 08:52.615
I GUESS I WANTED TO BE
ON THE TEAM SO MUCH

08:52.698 --> 08:54.742
I TURNED INTO
THE OPPOSITE OF TEAMWORK.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.994
TRISH AND SHERRY BACKED ME UP
AND I LET THEM DOWN.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.412

ENOUGH ALREADY.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.626
WAIT, I'VE GOT IT!

09:03.709 --> 09:05.795
I CAN STILL
DO THE RIGHT THING!

09:05.878 --> 09:07.380
CATCH YOU GUYS LATER.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.299
ISN'T THERE ANOTHER TEAM

09:10.383 --> 09:12.802
{\an1}YOU SHOULD BE
HELPING OUT RIGHT NOW?

09:12.885 --> 09:14.178

09:37.868 --> 09:39.620
NO THANKS TO YOU.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.290
WE CALL IT "THE DULLARD-
STIMPLETON SOLAR DOGGER."

09:42.373 --> 09:43.207
HUH?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.001
{\an1}WHAT ABOUT
"ROCKET-RODRIGUEZ?"

09:45.084 --> 09:49.005
NORMALLY, TO GET CREDIT
YOU HAVE TO DO <i> SOME</i> OF THE WORK.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.631
WE NEED THE CREDIT.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.508
WITHOUT CREDIT
WE'LL FLUNK SCIENCE.

09:52.591 --> 09:55.678
"FLUNK," THAT'LL HURT
EVEN MY GRADE... A LITTLE.

UM, COACH, SHERRY,
TRISH, EVERYBODY

10:33.799 --> 10:36.886
I SORT OF WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE TRYOUTS.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.722
I WAS PSYCHED
ABOUT MAYBE MAKING THE TEAM

10:39.805 --> 10:41.974
AND I GUESS I WENT KIND OF NUTS.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.686
ALL RIGHT, I WENT TOTALLY NUTS.

10:45.770 --> 10:46.228
IT'S OKAY.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.564
I'VE ACTED LIKE A JERK

10:48.647 --> 10:50.399
A FEW TIMES
IN MY LIFE, TOO.

IF YOU WORK TOGETHER.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.107
IT'S A WONDER I HAVEN'T HURLED.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.442
I AGREED TO GIVE THEM CREDIT

14:45.384 --> 14:47.177
(<i> whining</i> )

15:00.691 --> 15:03.152
{\an1}I WONDER WHAT THEY'RE
BUILDING IN THERE.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.111
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.529
WE'RE GOING TO SMOOSH THEM.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.031
SPEAKING OF SMOOSHING...

THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.141
{\an1}YOU KNOW, MAYBE
SHE WAS HERE FIRST.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.559
THIS IS OUR SPOT.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.937
MAN, BIG KIDS CAN BE

WE'VE NEVER LOST
THIS EVENT.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.011
WOW! THOSE ARE
SOME SERIOUS DUDES.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.806
HOW CAN WE BEAT OUT
A BUNCH OF GENIUSES?

16:13.889 --> 16:16.684
WE COULD GET LARS
TO SMASH THEIR CASTLE.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.936
{\an1}NAH, HE'D
NEVER HELP US.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.229
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE

16:20.312 --> 16:21.230
SOMETHING SO COOL

16:21.313 --> 16:23.065
{\an1}IT WILL BLOW

16:42.584 --> 16:43.794
I CAN'T SEE IT--

16:43.877 --> 16:46.130
THE PIER'S
IN THE WAY.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.385
WHAT IS THAT?

16:51.468 --> 16:53.846
THE FERRIS WHEEL.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.473
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE?

16:58.475 --> 17:00.018
WE'RE SUNK.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.105
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT
GOING TO LIKE MINE.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.567
WHOA!

17:06.650 --> 17:08.694
TWISTER, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.654
IT LOOKS EXACTLY
LIKE THE SHACK!

WITH TWISTER ON OUR TEAM

17:12.030 --> 17:13.906

(<i> mockingly</i> ):
GEE, I'M SORRY.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.834
I'LL TRY TO BE
MORE CAREFUL.

17:23.916 --> 17:26.502
{\an4}WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LEAVE US ALONE, LARS?

17:26.587 --> 17:28.380
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING
IMPORTANT HERE.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.507
OOH, SORRY.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.801
IF I KNEW IT WAS
SOMETHING "IMPORTANT"

17:32.885 --> 17:34.928
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE CAREFUL.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.638
(<i> laughing</i> )

17:38.098 --> 17:40.058
DON'T GET ANY FUNNY IDEAS,
TOUGH GUY.

17:43.103 --> 17:47.316
MAN, SOMEDAY THAT GUY'S
GOING TO PUSH ME TOO FAR.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.610
I REALLY WORKED HARD
ON THAT THING

17:49.693 --> 17:51.695
AND NOW IT'S RUINED!

17:51.779 --> 17:53.655
{\an1}WELL, WE GAVE IT
A GOOD SHOT.

17:53.739 --> 17:54.823

17:57.451 --> 17:59.369
{\an5}Sammy:
WAIT, WE CAN'T
QUIT NOW.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.498
OLIVER SAID WE WEREN'T
SMART ENOUGH TO DO IT.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.166
{\an1}THAT OLIVER IS
A SMART KID.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.044
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
OTTO ROCKET WAS A QUITTER.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.003
WHAT?

18:08.086 --> 18:09.421
YOU'RE A QUITTER?

18:09.505 --> 18:11.256
NO, I'M NOT A QUITTER.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.542
WE HAVE TIME TO MAKE
THE FERRIS WHEEL.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.502
WE SHOULD BE
THE LAST ONES JUDGED.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.046
UH... LAST MAY
NOT BE BEST.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.756
LOOK-- THE TIDE!

18:54.716 --> 18:56.802
ASSUMING THE RATE
OF TIDE GROWTH IS GREATER

18:56.885 --> 18:58.053
THAN THE TIME RATIO...

18:58.136 --> 18:59.221
ENGLISH, PLEASE.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.681
UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING

19:00.764 --> 19:03.934
THE TIDE WILL WASH AWAY OUR PIER
BEFORE THE JUDGES SEE IT.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.103

WE COULDN'T HAVE
DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.702
YEAH, WELL, DON'T
GET USED TO IT.

21:26.785 --> 21:31.081
YOU SQUIDS ARE ONLY A SMALL
STEP ABOVE THESE SHOOBIES.
