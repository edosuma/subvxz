00:01.001 --> 00:03.837
Your brother was pinned under rubble.
And Salazar shot him.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.922
<i>Breaking him out of prison?
That's insane.</i>

00:05.922 --> 00:07.340
I believe Valenzuela's innocent.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.758
You have a taped conversation.

00:08.758 --> 00:09.843
Make the arrest.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.136
<i>Jess is in a lot of trouble.</i>

00:11.136 --> 00:14.514
You wanna tell me what crazy thing
might be happening in Mexico?

00:14.514 --> 00:17.017
Like I said, I'm... shoe convention.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.476
<i>Liam Sadusky's alive.</i>

00:18.476 --> 00:21.021
"Cras est Nostrum."
<i>I've seen that before.</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:22.981
- We'll see you tomorrow.
- Take this.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.358
<i>First, we gotta get my journal.</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:27.027
<i>Years and years of my research
on the treasure.</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:30.572
Myles!

00:30.572 --> 00:32.032
<i>It's a map of the sky.</i>

00:32.032 --> 00:34.159
<i>It's pointing to a place
called the Devil's Swamp,</i>

00:34.159 --> 00:35.076
off the Mississippi River.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.537
Made it across the border.
Let's hope Jess does too.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.705
FBI, hands up!

00:39.164 --> 00:40.081
Take the map, go!

00:40.081 --> 00:41.499
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta get help.

00:41.499 --> 00:42.917
I put a tracker
in your father's shoe,

00:42.917 --> 00:44.711
<i>and I heard everything.</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:16.493
I'm from Ohio.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.495
I don't speak Spanish.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.746
Move.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.721
Rafael.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.724
I'll take your journal now.

01:40.975 --> 01:41.851
Oh.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.941
I told you I heard everything.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.611
It's...

01:57.742 --> 01:59.786
Ethan gave you something.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.122
Yeah.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.248
His credit card.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.083
But I didn't take it.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.418
Search her.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.422
Keep these two separated.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.927
You should have stayed on our side, Jess.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.310
Things would be going
a lot better for you.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.816
We're ready to board.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.363
Don't worry.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.656
We did the right thing.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.615
Did we?

04:00.615 --> 04:02.075
When we just waltzed in here

04:02.075 --> 04:06.037
told the FBI lady our wild story about
how your grandpa's nurse was killed

04:06.037 --> 04:08.164
because of a treasure hunt.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.041
Uh, she didn't believe a word of it.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.834
Eh... Did you see her face?

04:11.834 --> 04:14.629
And she's gonna ask me
about the prison break in Mexico.

04:14.629 --> 04:15.922
What am I supposed to say?

04:15.922 --> 04:17.882
I mean, am I, am I
under oath or something?

04:17.882 --> 04:19.008
No, it's not how it works, dude.

04:19.008 --> 04:20.051
You don't have to say anything.

04:20.718 --> 04:23.346
Yeah. I, um...
That's very hard for me, okay?

04:23.346 --> 04:25.598
I can't hold it in much longer.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.392
I'm a bad liar.
I'm sweating through my shirt.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.559
If she puts me on a polygraph,

04:28.559 --> 04:30.103
- I'ma light it up like a Christmas tree.
- Hey...

04:30.103 --> 04:32.272
Don't worry.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.940
You're not gonna have
to talk about Mexico.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.859
They're gonna find Myles's body,
it's gonna prove our story's true

04:36.859 --> 04:40.738
then they'll go after Billie,
arrest her and not Jess.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.824
- All right?
- Mm.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.577
- Well?
- Baton Rouge PD checked out your house.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.079
They didn't find Myles Moro's body.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.082
But there was a broken window

04:51.082 --> 04:53.876
and the door to the "Clue Room"
was missing.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.302
So they hid the body

05:02.885 --> 05:04.470
and the door with the bullet holes in it.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.265
These people are professionals.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.017
No, I, I mean, look,
they got you believing

05:09.017 --> 05:10.935
that Jess killed my grandpa
when Billie did it.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.353
I wanna believe you

05:12.353 --> 05:14.480
but you have to look at this
from where I'm sitting.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.817
Myles Moro is the one
that brought me the evidence

05:17.817 --> 05:19.193
proving Jess killed your grandpa

05:19.193 --> 05:21.529
and now you're telling me

05:21.529 --> 05:23.781
he told you it was Billie?

05:23.781 --> 05:26.659
And then, moreover, Billie had him killed.
But you know, there's no body.

05:26.659 --> 05:31.372
Why don't you guys just tell me
where exactly in Mexico Jess is?

05:31.372 --> 05:34.292
I told you, we don't know.

05:35.209 --> 05:37.378
We're afraid Billie has her.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.131
But you have no evidence of that.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.008
Okay.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.471
Billie did kidnap me.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.638
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.890
'Cause last time you told me she didn't.

05:48.890 --> 05:51.809
Yes, because Billie threatened me
and my friends.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.603
This time I'm telling the truth.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.563
Please, put, put me to a, a polygraph.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.689
No, no, no.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.066
It's not a good idea.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.484
We talked about this, remember?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.944
It is the only way to prove
that Billie is the bad guy here.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.196
Why is it a bad idea?

06:05.406 --> 06:06.366
What are you hiding?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.367
Nothing.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.371
Let's do this.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.249
- Just stay calm.
- Calm?

06:15.249 --> 06:17.543
Ethan, I'm handcuffed in an FBI building.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.713
I can't dole out any legal advice
because I'm not an attorney yet

06:20.713 --> 06:23.216
but I would strongly suggest
you don't say anything.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.425
Have you met me?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.347
Did I pass?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.600
Yeah.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.060
Yes.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.228
Go arrest Billie.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.439
Ross.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.274
The other two just got brought in.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.278
- What other two?
- I ask the questions.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.072
Thank you, Oren.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.448
You've been really helpful.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.034
Wait, wait.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.911
You're gonna arrest Billie too, right?

07:06.092 --> 07:07.510
Nice scare tactic

07:07.510 --> 07:09.971
but I know you've got
nothing on me in that file.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.389
It's not your file.

07:15.726 --> 07:16.894
It's your grandmother's.

07:17.478 --> 07:21.649
Pearl Baker, an activist
for racial equality in the '60s.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.278
Your grandma was
on every criminal watch list.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.822
Eventually, she was charged
with multiple crimes

07:27.822 --> 07:29.323
and that forced her into hiding.

07:29.323 --> 07:32.702
Well, I haven't spoken
to my grandma in years.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.788
So if you're looking for her,
I have no idea where she is.

07:35.788 --> 07:39.000
That's a lie but I don't care.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.960
I know the charges against her
were trumped-up.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.547
She was targeted for standing up
for her basic rights.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.217
It's obvious where you get
your fighting spirit from.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.220
Look.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.723
What happened to your grandma?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.391
That affects the whole family.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.394
I get why you don't trust us.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.440
When you and Jess first came in here...

08:04.066 --> 08:05.985
I did not take you seriously.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.696
I was wrong.

08:08.696 --> 08:12.074
I know that now because your friend Oren
just passed a polygraph.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.785
- He did?
- Mm-hm.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.621
You were telling the truth then.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.331
I need you to do it now.

08:20.082 --> 08:24.420
My boss is convinced
Jess murdered Peter Sadusky.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.713
I am not.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.049
I think Billie's behind it.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.594
And your friends are concerned
that she might have Jess now. So...

08:32.386 --> 08:36.390
please tell me
the last place you saw Jess.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.727
Let me try to help you find her.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.937
Forget it.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.814
You're just trying to manipulate me,

08:43.814 --> 08:45.483
saying what you think I wanna hear

08:45.483 --> 08:47.735
so you can find Jess and arrest her.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.363
Exactly how dumb do you think I am?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.582
You don't have to trust this.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.002
But maybe you could trust me.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.386
You know what I see?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.387
Mm.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.889
A typical Fed.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.725
Using information as a weapon.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.645
Arrest the right person next time.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.440
And stop treating us like criminals.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.194
You wanna make things right?
You start there.

09:31.153 --> 09:32.530
Let us go.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.423
Wait, so you're actually letting us go?
What's the...

09:50.423 --> 09:51.549
What's the catch here?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.342
There's no catch.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.762
That right there
is my personal cell phone number.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.557
If you change your mind,
please call me anytime.

10:00.975 --> 10:04.103
Wait. Your name is Hannah Betsy Ross?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.147
My mom liked to sew.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.410
Why did Agent Ross let us go?

10:19.910 --> 10:21.412
She's trying to play good cop.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.831
Well, shouldn't she have
bad-copped us first?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.000
Let's just get out of here.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.670
What are you doing here?

10:30.504 --> 10:31.839
Hey, where's Jess?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.341
We thought she was with you guys.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.968
Um... Can we just talk
about all of this outside?

10:40.306 --> 10:42.391
So you all did it,
you broke him out of prison?

10:42.391 --> 10:44.602
Uh, let's not broadcast it, okay?

10:45.311 --> 10:49.106
Whoa, whoa, 350 dollars
to get my chariot out of impound?

10:49.106 --> 10:50.274
That is robbery.

10:50.274 --> 10:53.402
So, what was Jess's dad's plan
to get her back out here?

10:53.402 --> 10:54.945
I mean, where were you all
supposed to meet her?

10:54.945 --> 10:55.946
We're not sure.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.491
Jess was supposed to call when her
and her dad got across the border.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.326
Yeah, and she hasn't called yet.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.578
- Okay, well, call her.
- This is my burner.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.829
Ethan, what's your number?

11:04.705 --> 11:05.581
Let's go.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.793
Why are you calling your own phone?

11:08.793 --> 11:10.378
Ethan gave his phone to Jess.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.420
Long story.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.590
It didn't ring. Phone's off.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.717
I'll ping her location.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.635
Great.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.136
They flooded the engine.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.683
She turned it off 16 hours ago
in Cholula, Mexico.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.934
That's basically where we left her.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.477
That doesn't make any sense.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.436
I knew it.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.647
Billie's got her.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.441
Maybe she was arrested.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.567
No, no.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.735
Agent Ross would've known that.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.737
- We need to get down to Mexico.
- And do what?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.823
We have no idea where in Mexico she is.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.700
Then we'll go to the last place
that phone was. Start there.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.576
If Billie has her, they're on the move.
Long gone.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.412
Okay, okay. So the phone's turned off

11:44.412 --> 11:47.998
but I can still maybe track it
using its IMEI identity.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.083
All right, let's go.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.918
I just need my gear.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.504
Okay. Let's go.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.802
DECISIVE GREEDY RECKLESS

12:01.220 --> 12:03.222
You already know what's in that journal.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.348
It's outlived its purpose.

12:04.348 --> 12:07.059
Then why were you hiding it
from me, Rafael?

12:08.102 --> 12:10.688
Back in Mexico,
you were just about to tell Jess

12:10.688 --> 12:13.566
that you knew how to find the treasure
once you got to the Devil's Swamp.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.737
And I'm betting that the answer
is in this book.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.781
It's just a book of memories.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.784
What can I say?
I'm a sentimental old fool.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.035
Ah. Right.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.620
I don't like to forget.

12:29.331 --> 12:31.834
But I understand why you do.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.296
After what happened to your family

12:36.046 --> 12:37.840
I would try to forget.

12:38.674 --> 12:41.177
Sebastian told me
how your parents died.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.973
Horrible thing for a ten-year-old to see.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.146
London, right?

12:52.146 --> 12:54.023
Christmas shopping.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.067
An IRA attack that had nothing
to do with your family.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.614
No ten-year-old should ever have
to see that.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.910
It's a tragedy.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.747
I learned a very valuable lesson.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.584
Never dwell on the past.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.545
Well, that's confusing considering

13:16.545 --> 13:21.175
all treasure hunters do
is dwell on the past.

13:27.389 --> 13:28.474
No.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.773
Treasure hunters find things.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.328
Well, what do we have here?

14:17.106 --> 14:19.692
So this is what you've been
hiding from me?

14:21.735 --> 14:24.071
It's just Manuela's old sewing needle.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.615
Nothing more.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.743
Then why haven't you taken a breath
since I found it?

15:00.482 --> 15:02.109
Did you move my bag?

15:02.109 --> 15:03.485
No.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.656
- What did you take?
- Nothing.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.242
- It must have shifted during the flight.
- Get up.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.369
Get up!

15:18.584 --> 15:19.752
Feet apart.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.800
- See?
- Sit down.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.971
Put your hands
where I can see them.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.433
I don't trust you at all.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.486
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Oh, yeah. No problem.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.029
Work thing.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.323
Uh, please have some focaccia. It's free.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.450
Uh, not that I'm cheap. Just...

15:52.618 --> 15:54.495
Order whatever you like, it's on me.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.290
Or is that anti-feminist?

15:58.290 --> 16:00.292
Wow, doing great.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.752
Just, uh...

16:01.752 --> 16:03.712
Please have, have some focaccia.

16:04.713 --> 16:05.547
Uh, excuse me.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.924
Could I have a glass of your boldest red

16:06.924 --> 16:08.842
and just fill that to the brim? Thank you.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.096
Uh, you do know it's lunchtime, right?

16:12.805 --> 16:13.889
I've had a day.

16:14.556 --> 16:17.059
Uh, would... flowers help?

16:23.440 --> 16:24.566
Candy wrappers?

16:24.566 --> 16:29.071
We got Flaming Hot Cheetos,
Tic Tacs, and Airheads.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.949
That's all the food
that has Orange Dye Number 47 in it.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.034
To help with the Sadusky case.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.376
This is the sweetest gift
anybody has ever given me.

16:48.757 --> 16:49.717
Why all the sighing?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.051
It's too late.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.138
Hendricks wants me
to arrest Jess Valenzuela

16:54.138 --> 16:55.723
for the murder of Peter Sadusky but--

16:55.723 --> 16:57.099
But you don't wanna get it wrong again.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.812
All my evidence points to Billie Pearce.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.815
First, there was the further-farther

17:04.815 --> 17:06.650
incident in the Valenzuela confession.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.943
Expertly deepfaked.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.528
And then...

17:11.864 --> 17:14.158
That's a signed affidavit
from Oren Bradley

17:14.158 --> 17:16.618
attesting to being kidnapped
by Billie Pearce.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.871
That's the same kidnapping
from the USS Kidd

17:18.871 --> 17:20.581
which he said originally didn't happen.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.458
He also passed a polygraph.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.876
This is real evidence.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.420
- Did you take it to Hendricks?
- He dismissed it.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.422
Polygraphs can be beat.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.883
He just thinks Oren is a good liar.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.343
But none of this adds up.

17:33.343 --> 17:37.347
I mean, this kid was sweating
through every pore on his body.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.017
If, if he lied on that polygraph,
he would have red-lined.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.519
I mean, at least that's my gut.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.524
Then what are you doing here?

17:48.108 --> 17:49.359
You don't need Hendricks approval.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.986
Go question this Billie Pearce.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.030
Okay, not only do I not know where she is,

17:53.030 --> 17:55.741
I'm certainly not gonna get
a confession out of her.

18:00.079 --> 18:00.996
Let's...

18:02.164 --> 18:03.916
Let's just enjoy our lunch.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.838
Okay, but then the weirdest thing, right?

18:09.838 --> 18:13.425
So now Liam Sadusky
has come to me with a story.

18:13.425 --> 18:17.179
Billie's people killed Peter Sadusky's
nurse in the study.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.642
Wait. Did you just say
there's a dead body in the study?

18:21.642 --> 18:22.851
Mm.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.605
- This is the best date ever.
- Yeah.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.024
The police went and they checked it out
and there's nothing.

18:29.608 --> 18:30.859
Well...

18:30.859 --> 18:32.569
I mean, if the police didn't find a body

18:32.569 --> 18:35.656
they'd have no reason to search
for bloodstains, would they?

18:40.994 --> 18:43.413
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.667
I got my kit in the car.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.216
I can't believe I found you in a morgue.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.009
Let's go.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.345
Uh, yeah. Um...

18:58.345 --> 18:59.388
Thank you.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.562
Got Myles's laptop.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.606
Make sure you wipe it before you dump it.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.651
You got his phone?

19:19.032 --> 19:22.411
That's not Myles's phone.
It's Liam Sadusky's.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.874
We're gonna have to go back.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.878
This is killing me.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.629
I can't stand not knowing where Jess is.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.132
You two have known each other for forever.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.093
Yeah.

19:38.093 --> 19:42.431
Her mom was my nanny and tutor
so we practically grew up together.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.315
I lost my dad and my grandpa
to this treasure hunt.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.151
I'm not gonna let that happen to her.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.075
Nice tights.

20:02.910 --> 20:03.869
Yeah.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.829
I don't know what I was thinking.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.958
Latte with a triple shot.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.837
Thanks.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.176
I'm not seeing Ethan's phone anywhere.

20:19.968 --> 20:24.473
It's either in a Faraday bag
or outside all app-assisted GPS.

20:24.973 --> 20:28.268
Like a, desert or a jungle?

20:28.894 --> 20:30.312
Someplace remote.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.064
Yeah.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.191
That's not good.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.246
There is one way I can find out
what this needle is for.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.831
Kacey.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.085
Bring Jess over here.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.094
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, what are you doing?

21:02.094 --> 21:03.679
There's no need for that!

21:06.848 --> 21:07.849
What is this?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.562
So that's what you were doing.

21:12.562 --> 21:13.939
Move.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.568
She had a phone.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.548
This opens something, doesn't it?

21:46.388 --> 21:47.347
Give me that medallion.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.520
- No.
- Hey, be careful with that.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.855
No. Ah!

22:22.090 --> 22:23.258
What is that?

22:23.258 --> 22:25.594
It's a Wayfinder.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.305
It's like an ancient compass.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.848
Only it doesn't work.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.768
Oh, but it will work, won't it?

22:38.106 --> 22:39.816
When we're close to the treasure

22:41.318 --> 22:43.236
in the Devil's Swamp.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.952
<i>♪ What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger ♪</i>

22:50.952 --> 22:52.913
<i>♪ Stand a little taller ♪</i>

22:52.913 --> 22:57.459

22:57.459 --> 22:59.544
<i>♪ When I'm alone ♪</i>

22:59.544 --> 23:01.630
Let's give a big hand for Meena.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.384
Oh, my god!

23:09.262 --> 23:10.806
That was fun, oh, my god!

23:10.806 --> 23:12.891
- So good. Let's go.
- Oh, my god. Okay.

23:12.891 --> 23:13.975
- Oops, sorry.
- Sorry.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.477
Hey, girls.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.603
Don't look.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.189
Dessert from the cutie behind you.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.652
Okay. I say go for it, girl.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.195
You're way better off without Ethan.

23:28.115 --> 23:28.949
Mm.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.080
Meena, your phone is, like, blowing up.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.344
Ethan, why is your ex-girl
calling me right now?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.515
<i>Oren, did something happen to Ethan?</i>

23:53.515 --> 23:55.475
Meena, hi. No, he's...

23:55.475 --> 23:56.768
He's okay. He's right here.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.061
Hey.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.312
Ethan. Are you in trouble?

23:59.312 --> 24:01.189
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

24:01.189 --> 24:02.691
Tell, tell me your safe word.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.777
Yeah, Ethan. We're waiting.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.657
- Tickles and giggles.
- <i>Oh, thank God.</i>

24:11.408 --> 24:13.076
I thought the worst. I, I got an SOS.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.744
Jess.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.872
- She must have sent it.
- <i>Jess?</i>

24:16.872 --> 24:18.123
<i>Why does she have your phone?</i>

24:19.207 --> 24:20.417
<i>Of course, she has your phone.</i>

24:20.417 --> 24:21.960
No, it's not like that.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.044
You know what?

24:23.044 --> 24:25.505
I'm unsubscribing
from all this J-Ethan drama.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.966
<i>Meena, don't hang up.
She's in danger.</i>

24:28.925 --> 24:29.885
We think she's been kidnapped.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.178
<i>What?</i>

24:31.178 --> 24:32.888
<i>Please, just tell us where she is.</i>

24:32.888 --> 24:34.347
Oh, my god. Um, hang on.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.974
Here, I'm sending you the pin.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.267
Okay, who are you talking to?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.185
<i>No.</i>

24:42.647 --> 24:43.940
She's in a large body of water?

24:45.734 --> 24:47.444
That's the Gulf of Mexico.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.779
She's on Billie's plane.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.365
That's why I couldn't track her.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.326
She can't just land in the States.
She'll get stopped by customs.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.243
No.

24:55.243 --> 24:57.496
With Billie's money
and black market connections,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.247
no doubt she has a workaround for that.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.582
Where could she be taking Jess?

25:00.582 --> 25:02.375
I can track that plane.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.628
We've just gotta find a crappy motel.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.963
How's that gonna help us?

25:06.963 --> 25:08.548
It'll have a crappy TV.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.554
Cool, cool, cool.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.139
Perfect place to die.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.769
Perfect. Ethan, Liam,
get your peloton bodies over there.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.312
We gotta move that TV.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.447
Oh.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.117
- Well, there goes your security deposit.
- Great.

25:36.117 --> 25:40.830
All modern aircraft record their model
and location on ADS-B signal.

25:40.830 --> 25:44.459
You're saying you can track Billie's plane
with that old antenna?

25:44.459 --> 25:46.086
And this. Dongles.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.088
Don't leave home without them.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.173
Have you done this before?

25:50.173 --> 25:51.633
I've watched videos.

25:53.760 --> 25:54.719
Thank you.

25:59.182 --> 26:00.433
Can you clip those two together?

26:00.433 --> 26:02.269
- Sure.
- Thank you.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.356
And now, gentlemen.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.691
Final act.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.903
1090 megahertz.

26:12.487 --> 26:13.780
I'm in.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.533
You think Billie's only bling
is nice shoes?

26:16.533 --> 26:19.995
According to <i>Crypto Magazine</i>,
her plane's a Bombardier Global 7500.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.914
There's only, like,
a hundred in the world.

26:24.499 --> 26:25.584
There it is.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.877
It's starting its descent.

26:28.628 --> 26:31.423
The airport on its trajectory is...

26:32.007 --> 26:33.592
Vicksburg County Airport.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.509
Mississippi.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.303
It's a two-hour drive.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.679
We'd better get going.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.250
Looks like Sadusky really
did have a secret room.

27:07.250 --> 27:10.295
It's like a great place to hide clues
to a treasure.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.756
Guess Jess and her friends
really were on a treasure hunt.

27:19.262 --> 27:22.682
So, uh, where did this Liam say
the body was?

27:24.601 --> 27:25.852
All right, we're almost there.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.604
Anything on the police scanners?

27:28.563 --> 27:30.023
Police did a welfare check.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.358
- They found nothing.
- Good.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.152
Let's get this over with.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.447
Okay. Do your magic.

27:45.789 --> 27:49.459
If there was blood,
we'd be seeing blue spots on the floor.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.389
Why would Liam lie to me
about something like this?

28:04.140 --> 28:06.101
Maybe the killers
are really good at cleaning up?

28:19.614 --> 28:21.074
The phone's gotta be here somewhere.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.492
Check under the desk.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.551
Don't see it.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.261
Try calling it.

28:50.937 --> 28:51.896
Found it.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.565
Let's go.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.901
FBI, freeze!

29:23.344 --> 29:24.429
No, no, no.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.890
No. No, stay with me. Stay with me.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.308
Stay with me.

29:31.686 --> 29:32.812
He's gone, Bets.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.196
The plane's still parked.
They're not going anywhere.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.698
Well, can you access the airport cameras?
Maybe see what they're doing?

29:43.698 --> 29:46.576
Ethan, you know there are limits
to what I can do, right?

29:47.744 --> 29:49.120
I figured it was a long shot.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.081
But that's not one of my limits.

29:52.665 --> 29:55.001
<i>"Cras Est Nostrum"</i>. What's that?

29:55.001 --> 29:56.377
I have no idea.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.463
My grandpa sent me
this book before he died.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.508
<i>"The Book of Famous Lost Treasures."</i>

30:01.508 --> 30:03.176
Huh. Cool.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.430
"There's no greater treasure than time.

30:07.430 --> 30:10.391
I hope one day you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

30:10.391 --> 30:11.810
Love, Grandpa."

30:12.644 --> 30:14.062
My grandpa used to always say that.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.480
Why did he underline those words?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.357
-"Find" and "time"?
- It's a cipher.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.901
He... he's trying to send me
a secret message.

30:20.443 --> 30:21.736
Even cooler.

30:21.736 --> 30:23.947
It's like a... advanced Wordle.

30:23.947 --> 30:25.448
Yeah, but look. There's just, just,

30:25.448 --> 30:26.950
there's too many underlying words

30:26.950 --> 30:28.201
and, and sentences.

30:28.201 --> 30:31.204
Okay, so why don't we focus
on finding "time"?

30:33.915 --> 30:35.166
Nefertiti's Tomb.

30:40.755 --> 30:44.342
Oh, 1330 BC.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.720
They're page numbers.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.722
- Go to 13.
- Okay.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.432
Thirteen.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.353
"All."

30:55.353 --> 30:56.938
"All". Thirty. Thirty.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.484
"All."

31:01.484 --> 31:04.279
Pages 13 and 30, they share the same word.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.655
"All".

31:06.656 --> 31:08.324
- Here.
- Next one, next one.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.409
I'll take this.

31:10.910 --> 31:11.744
What's the next one?

31:12.912 --> 31:14.247
Cuirass of Alexander.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.669
Boat's fueled up and ready to go.

31:21.337 --> 31:22.505
Jessita, listen.

31:22.505 --> 31:25.383
When we get to the Devil's Swamp,
it's gonna be a lot of traps.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.010
We have to be very careful.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.970
You gotta keep an eye out for the Coyote.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.514
It's a warning that the Daughters left
for their people.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.099
The Coyote's a trickster.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.393
It means there's a trap.
Death just around the corner.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.936
Like spike pits and snakes?

31:36.936 --> 31:38.521
Yeah, don't forget darts.

31:38.521 --> 31:39.981
Not to mention decapitating blades.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.650
Well, couldn't be better, right?

31:43.192 --> 31:44.485
Wait, did you not hear what we were saying

31:44.485 --> 31:46.613
about dying an unimaginably painful
and ugly death?

31:46.613 --> 31:48.156
We're not the ones
that are gonna be dying.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.866
We're gonna use the traps as weapons

31:49.866 --> 31:52.327
and lead Billie and her minions
right into them.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.080
I like how you think.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.374
You're smart like your mother.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.877
But you're devious like me.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.384
-"Lost".
-"Lost".

32:10.011 --> 32:11.471
And I'm in.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.807
Oh, that's not good.

32:14.807 --> 32:16.142
What, they're not there?

32:16.935 --> 32:19.479
No, they're there.

32:20.063 --> 32:22.357
Billie's got an entire army
with her this time.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.484
And a boat.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.778
I gotta record this.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.238
Where are they going?

32:29.739 --> 32:31.699
There's a lot of waterways
off the Mississippi.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.786
- Mm.
- The Devil's Swamp.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.246
The swamp is haunted.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.748
It's all over my subreddits.

32:38.748 --> 32:40.875
It's like the Bermuda Triangle
of the Mississippi.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.293
The legend of people getting lost

32:42.293 --> 32:44.712
and disappearing there
goes back hundreds of years.

32:44.712 --> 32:45.672
So...

32:46.297 --> 32:48.800
So, what if the Daughters
of the Plumed Serpent

32:48.800 --> 32:51.260
made up that legend to scare people away?

32:52.261 --> 32:53.262
Mm.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.350
Okay. I know, I know. Go ahead and say it.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.851
"Here comes Oren again with his crazy."

32:58.851 --> 33:00.395
- I get it.
- No, no.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.522
That all actually kind of makes sense
but that's a flatboat.

33:02.522 --> 33:03.982
It's made for shallow swamps.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.650
So, what do we do?

33:05.650 --> 33:08.444
I mean, we can't outgun Billie's team.

33:10.863 --> 33:12.156
I know someone who can.

33:27.046 --> 33:28.214
Ross was in the study...

33:34.429 --> 33:35.596
Coffee?

33:36.097 --> 33:37.098
It'll help.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.567
You stumbled into a really dangerous
situation here, Ross.

33:48.151 --> 33:49.444
What were you doing here?

33:51.070 --> 33:53.740
I came to investigate
a report of a murder.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.034
Another murder?

33:57.410 --> 34:00.496
Liam Sadusky reported
that his grandpa's nurse

34:00.496 --> 34:01.664
was killed in this study.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.711
There's no body, no blood.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.838
But his cell phone was here.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.340
The guys who shot at me came for it.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.384
I'm guessing this has to do
with that treasure

34:13.384 --> 34:14.510
you keep trying to tell me about?

34:14.510 --> 34:17.430
I'm telling you, Billie is behind this.

34:17.430 --> 34:21.476
We can't make an arrest
based on "further" and "farther".

34:21.476 --> 34:22.643
Yeah.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.740
Well, can we make an arrest based on this?

34:38.576 --> 34:39.827
Where are they?

35:12.693 --> 35:14.028
It's working.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.197
Looks like we're going that way.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.620
I was wearing it this whole time.

35:23.621 --> 35:24.872
Why didn't you tell me?

35:25.540 --> 35:27.416
I wasn't sure it would work until now.

35:49.605 --> 35:51.524
Let's get that boat launched.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.826
"All lost treasures.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.452
All found.

36:03.452 --> 36:04.662
All destroyed

36:04.662 --> 36:06.831
by <i>Cras Est Nostrum</i>."

36:06.831 --> 36:08.332
What does that mean?

36:10.376 --> 36:12.378
It means Billie isn't a treasure hunter.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.755
She's a treasure destroyer.

36:14.755 --> 36:15.882
What?

36:15.882 --> 36:17.967
Why would anyone wanna destroy a treasure?

36:18.843 --> 36:19.886
I don't know.

36:19.886 --> 36:22.847
It looks like <i>Cras Est Nostrum</i>
is some sort of secret cabal.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.641
I guess my grandpa figured out
some of its key members.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.186
Guess who's the leader?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.395
Billie?

36:29.395 --> 36:31.314
No, she's part of it.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.524
The leader is...

36:35.234 --> 36:36.903
Salazar.

36:39.572 --> 36:42.074
Billie works for Salazar?

36:43.409 --> 36:45.828
I guess my grandpa
was about to expose the cabal.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.039
That's why he was killed.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.304
This is clear.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.932
There's nobody here.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.350
I know how to find them.

37:11.437 --> 37:13.231
It's Agent Ross.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.359
- They're not here.
- <i>Yeah, we, uh...</i>

37:16.359 --> 37:17.735
<i>We saw the caravan leaving.</i>

37:17.735 --> 37:18.694
Do you know where they would go?

37:18.694 --> 37:20.196
<i>No, but...</i>

37:20.196 --> 37:22.657
we have a hunch.

37:25.159 --> 37:26.619
Tasha Rivers thinks
they're heading to a place

37:26.619 --> 37:28.246
called the Devil's Swamp.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.872
- The Devil's Swamp?
- Mm-hm.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.875
That's pretty remote. I mean,
even the locals don't go there.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.796
We're gonna need boats, backup.

37:43.803 --> 37:44.637
You want one?

37:46.514 --> 37:48.015
No, I'm good.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.816
That's all the food
that has Orange Dye Number 47 in it.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.068
There was an orange stain on his hands.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.488
<i>The English Yew killed him.</i>

38:24.844 --> 38:26.637
Oh, hey. What are you doing?

38:26.637 --> 38:28.222
You murdered Peter Sadusky.

38:30.349 --> 38:31.517
- Put that thing down.
- Sir...

38:31.517 --> 38:33.728
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I need you to put your hands up.

38:35.229 --> 38:37.189
You pull that weapon,
I'm pulling this trigger.

38:37.189 --> 38:38.316
Take your gun out.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.278
Two fingers, nice and easy by the grip.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.613
Place it on the floor, kick it over here.

38:44.613 --> 38:45.865
What is wrong with you?

38:48.993 --> 38:50.244
Phone.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.413
What... Okay.

38:52.413 --> 38:53.998
Anything else?

38:57.835 --> 38:59.253
It all makes sense now.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.882
That's why you were pushing me
to arrest Jess Valenzuela.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.508
She was just a fall guy.

39:04.508 --> 39:07.762
Ross, you're exhausted.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.972
You just experienced something traumatic.

39:09.972 --> 39:12.058
Listen to yourself. You're losing it.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.852
No, I'm thinking clearly.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.938
Handcuff yourself to that railing.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.196
I took a chance on you

39:25.196 --> 39:27.323
after you made the wrong arrest in DC

39:27.323 --> 39:30.743
and here you are,
you're making the same mistake again.

39:30.743 --> 39:33.329
Your career was supposed to be over
then I gave you a job.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.539
You have until the count of three.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.544
- One.
- Fine.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.429
Guess what, Ross?

39:50.429 --> 39:51.680
You're done now.

39:55.935 --> 39:56.977
Vicksburg PD.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.146
This is Agent Ross, FBI.

39:59.146 --> 40:02.400
I've detained a murder suspect
on a Bombardier Global 7500.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.901
He'll be waiting for you.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.778
I'm going after his accomplices.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.701
You go to that swamp alone,

40:13.285 --> 40:14.787
you are gonna get killed.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.463
Bets, you can't be going up
there by yourself.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.090
- You gotta call backup.
- I have no choice.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.550
I don't know how high up this goes.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.009
<i>I don't know who else
is working with them.</i>

40:29.009 --> 40:31.220
If I don't call you back in 20 minutes...

40:32.721 --> 40:33.681
Bets?

40:34.640 --> 40:35.558
Bets.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.559

We are about to find
the great Pan-American treasure

41:29.111 --> 41:32.072
and prove Manuela was right.

41:32.072 --> 41:36.577
This has been your dream
for the last 20 years, Rafael.

41:38.287 --> 41:39.914
Now you can die happy.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.708
Well, I'd rather not die.

41:43.292 --> 41:44.335
Freeze!

41:46.128 --> 41:48.172
Drop your weapons or I shoot Billie.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.510
Drop them!

41:57.056 --> 41:58.140
Your treasure hunt is over.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.600
The police are on their way.

42:03.896 --> 42:04.813
No.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.004
I tried to warn you.

42:55.030 --> 42:57.825
You're a liability, Sebastian.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.787
Salazar.
