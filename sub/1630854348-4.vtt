00:11.333 --> 00:12.625
Late-night TV.

00:13.750 --> 00:16.125
Images and voices in the dark.

00:16.208 --> 00:17.416
In our head.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.791
An electronic cabinet of curiosities,

00:20.875 --> 00:24.625
blurring the line between what is outside
and what is inside.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.541
What we are,
and what we are told we should be.

00:29.208 --> 00:32.625
Perfection is but a toll-free number away,

00:33.125 --> 00:37.583
and this cabinet
is controlled by a magic wand

00:38.291 --> 00:41.333
made of cheap plastic and numbers.

00:42.416 --> 00:46.458
It fits right in your hand,
and it is hard to let go.

00:46.958 --> 00:49.875
Our story today is "The Outside,"

00:49.958 --> 00:53.000
and its director, Ana Lily Amirpour.

03:16.125 --> 03:19.291
<i>Ho-ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!</i>

03:19.375 --> 03:21.333
<i>Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!</i>

03:21.416 --> 03:22.291
<i>Ho-ho-ho!</i>

03:22.375 --> 03:23.708
<i>Oh! Oh.</i>

03:23.791 --> 03:26.291
<i>I love the kit,</i>
<i>because it's just a fat, juicy steak</i>

03:26.375 --> 03:28.083

03:32.916 --> 03:34.833
<i>…common in women ages 65 and up.</i>

03:34.916 --> 03:37.708
<i>Change in appetite, hand tremors,</i>
<i>dry mouth, increased thirst,</i>

03:37.791 --> 03:40.916
<i>increased urination,</i>
<i>and lots of sexual urges common--</i>

03:41.000 --> 03:43.125

04:01.958 --> 04:05.000
<i>Call 1-900-860-1111 now…</i>

04:50.166 --> 04:51.458
Did you see anyone?

05:34.541 --> 05:37.291
Glen Ellyn Police Department,
this is Officer Chapman.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.875
Keith, there was that noise again.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.666
What are you doing up, Stace?

05:42.250 --> 05:45.875
-What if someone's in the house?
-<i>There's no one in the house.</i>

05:46.458 --> 05:48.125
Can you say the thing?

05:48.208 --> 05:50.041
The house makes noise at night.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.833
It's just an old house.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.166
And every time there's a noise,

05:55.333 --> 05:57.875
has there ever been a stranger inside?

05:57.958 --> 05:58.875
Never.

05:59.416 --> 06:00.250
<i>Never.</i>

06:02.166 --> 06:03.000
Okay.

06:04.416 --> 06:06.291
Get some sleep, hon, okay?

06:06.375 --> 06:07.916
<i>All right, see you in the morning.</i>

06:08.000 --> 06:10.916
What if this time
there is someone in the house? What if--

06:21.791 --> 06:22.750
I don't get it.

06:22.833 --> 06:26.791
Twenty-five grand on liposuction,
she's still eating donuts.

06:26.875 --> 06:29.375
I mean, hello?
It's one or the other, sweetheart.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.958
You know her husband
is fucking that Nancy girl, right?

06:32.041 --> 06:34.583
Mm, well, he always stares at my tits
when he comes in here,

06:34.666 --> 06:36.000
so I am not surprised.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.208
Nancy who?

06:37.291 --> 06:41.208
You know Nancy,
that little whore with the ass implants.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.833
-So sad.
-Mmm.

06:42.916 --> 06:45.500
-She's on Xanax 24/7 now.
-I'm sure.

06:45.583 --> 06:48.500
She can't even keep her eyes open,
and that's not the worst part.

06:48.583 --> 06:51.583
He left her for a teenager
that he met on a cruise.

06:51.666 --> 06:53.708
-Oh my God, scumbag!
-Mm-hmm.

06:53.791 --> 06:56.916
-A masseuse.
-Yeah. Can you imagine?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.791
When Peter leaves me,
I'm gonna cut off his balls.

06:59.875 --> 07:00.708
Oh!

07:00.791 --> 07:02.666
I'm gonna take the house,
half his retirement,

07:02.750 --> 07:05.500
and he is gonna be eating
frozen dinners and Viagra

07:05.583 --> 07:07.666
trying to keep up with his new girlfriend.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.416
-Hey, ladies.
-Oh hey, Cassidy!

07:09.500 --> 07:10.791
Hi, Cassidy.

07:10.875 --> 07:11.708
Hey.

07:11.791 --> 07:12.875
Yes.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.166
Did you guys see that?

07:14.666 --> 07:16.708
She always looks at my tits!

07:17.208 --> 07:18.666
I think she's a lesbian.

07:19.375 --> 07:22.291
-I don't mind. I mean, I have great tits.
-You do.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.291
I mean, you really do.

07:23.375 --> 07:26.375
-They look amazing, honey.
-They're perky.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.000
Yes!

07:28.083 --> 07:32.333
I was at the Jensens' party,
and you know, Sam, he hit on me.

07:33.458 --> 07:34.916
-Come on!
-Mm-hmm!

07:35.000 --> 07:38.125
Well, he had a few martinis,

07:38.208 --> 07:41.333
he unzipped his pants, and he showed me.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.458
Yes.

08:05.625 --> 08:06.458
Hey, Stacey.

08:06.541 --> 08:07.625
Oh, hey.

08:07.708 --> 08:11.250
-I didn't know you were still here.
-Yeah, can't forget this.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.583
Here. Last pick.

08:13.875 --> 08:14.750
Last pick?

08:14.833 --> 08:16.000
Secret Santa.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.125
For Gina's party tomorrow?
You're the last pick.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.041
Oh.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.791
This one's for you, Stacey.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.791
-It's for me?
-Mm-hmm.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.541
Okay.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.750
Well, here we go.

08:30.666 --> 08:32.833
Okay. I'll see you at the party.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.708
And, uh, don't work too late, okay?

08:36.583 --> 08:37.416
Will do.

08:37.916 --> 08:39.166
See you at the party!

10:04.916 --> 10:06.916
-Hey, hon.
-Hey.

10:08.083 --> 10:12.000
Guess who got invited
to a Secret Santa at Gina Kapov's house?

10:12.083 --> 10:12.958
Gina?

10:13.500 --> 10:14.541
Uh…

10:16.166 --> 10:21.416
-She's the one with the crazy dog?
-Yeah, but… it's Gina Kapov.

10:22.791 --> 10:27.291
-I thought you hated those women.
-Hated? What are you talking about?

10:27.375 --> 10:28.208
Well…

10:29.041 --> 10:31.666
I mean, you've been
working there a long time,

10:31.750 --> 10:34.416
and they just now invite you to a party?
Seems rude.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.833
It's just women, you know?

10:35.916 --> 10:38.875
Takes a while for certain women
to invite someone like me.

10:38.958 --> 10:41.458
Oh, what do you mean, "someone like you"?

10:41.541 --> 10:42.958
Eh, you know, I'm just me.

10:43.541 --> 10:44.541
I don't match.

10:45.208 --> 10:46.041
Yeah.

10:46.750 --> 10:50.666
And thank God you don't, Stace.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.416
Hey, listen to me.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.125
It's different now.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.458
She invited me to her Secret Santa,

10:56.541 --> 10:58.666
and I'm just dying
to see the inside of her house.

10:58.750 --> 11:02.000
I bet it's magnificent.
I bet it's like a catalog.

11:02.083 --> 11:04.625
I mean, her whole life is like a catalog.

11:04.708 --> 11:08.791
Um, she's got the most beautiful skin,
and her hair is always so shiny,

11:08.875 --> 11:12.416
and she could walk into a room
and make friends with anyone, you know?

11:12.916 --> 11:14.250
Imagine that.

11:16.416 --> 11:19.250
You walked into a room
and made friends with me, didn't cha?

11:27.583 --> 11:30.041
-Yeah, look at him, huh?

11:30.541 --> 11:31.500
He's a beaut.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.333
Mm-hmm.

11:35.458 --> 11:36.416
You hungry?

11:37.208 --> 11:39.458
I'm gonna eat the rest of these wings.

11:39.541 --> 11:40.375
Poker's on.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.166
No, I gotta finish him.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.458
Okay.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.833
<i>Three clubs out there.</i>

11:52.750 --> 11:56.583
<i>The turn card is the three of clubs.</i>
<i>That gives Martini the gutshot.</i>

12:33.791 --> 12:35.916
Delilah! Delilah!

12:36.000 --> 12:37.916
No, no. No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

12:38.000 --> 12:39.375
Stop it. You're being…

12:39.458 --> 12:40.875
Stop, stop, stop it!

12:40.958 --> 12:43.125
Oh, I know, it is exciting, okay. It's…

12:43.708 --> 12:46.375
Come on in, come on in.
She's never like this. I'm so sorry.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.541
You are going to the basement. Come on!

12:49.125 --> 12:50.375
-But then…
-Mm.

12:50.458 --> 12:51.875
…he pulls his pants down

12:52.916 --> 12:55.958
and whips out this huge dick.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.625
-And we are talking huge.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.000
-How huge?
-I mean, this is huge.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.083
How huge?

13:01.166 --> 13:03.875
I might end up in the emergency room.

13:03.958 --> 13:07.416
And that is the upside
of getting divorced.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.625
Getting away from that boring little dick
I was married to.

13:13.666 --> 13:16.041
-Now cheers to that.
-Yes indeed.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.833
-Cheers.
-Yay.

13:18.916 --> 13:19.916
Cheers.

13:21.666 --> 13:22.875
Mmm!

13:22.958 --> 13:25.916
Well, ever since Peter
started taking those antidepressants,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.166
his dick is like a wet spaghetti noodle.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.958
-Oh no.
-Yeah, he can't even get it in.

13:31.041 --> 13:35.000
Ugh, that is the worst!
Spaghetti-noodle dick is absolutely…

13:35.083 --> 13:36.375
-Oh, it's tragic.
-…the worst.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.083
Yeah. Well, he can't get hard,

13:38.166 --> 13:40.875
so he just has me
put the vibrator up his ass.

13:40.958 --> 13:43.250
You put it in his… Like, in his…

13:43.333 --> 13:44.291
In his ass.

13:44.375 --> 13:47.083
-And he likes it?
-Of course he likes it, Lisa.

13:47.166 --> 13:48.666
I mean, they all do.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.250
Wouldn't let my husband near mine.
Mm-mm.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.291
Well, Peter's obsessed with mine.

13:52.375 --> 13:54.791
Well, I'm obsessed
with my vibrator, too, so…

13:54.875 --> 13:57.875
Yeah, well, I only wish
I found mine in my twenties.

13:57.958 --> 13:59.750
That and fillers. Am I right?

13:59.833 --> 14:00.791
Oh, preach!

14:00.875 --> 14:03.458
Oh my God, that filler look
is so hot right now.

14:03.541 --> 14:07.500
Yeah, Gina, your skin looks amazing.
You're doing something new. What is it?

14:07.583 --> 14:10.375
Oh, that's so sweet.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.166
Okay, you all need
to see Dr. Ramesh. Really.

14:13.250 --> 14:17.791
He's got these new Ruboderm fillers,
and it's like… a baby's butt.

14:17.875 --> 14:20.083
-Right on.
-I love fillers. Yeah.

14:20.666 --> 14:24.166
Yeah, I'm gonna have my facelift,
and then I am gonna file for divorce.

14:24.250 --> 14:27.250
The thing to do
is get, like, a mini facelift,

14:27.333 --> 14:28.958
or like a planar facelift.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.875
So that is when they go in under the skin,

14:30.958 --> 14:33.000
and they take the tissue
right close to the muscle,

14:33.083 --> 14:34.625
and they just pull it tight like this.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.750
So good.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.500
-It's 25,000, right?
-25,000.

14:38.583 --> 14:40.041
-25,000?
-I'm on the waitlist.

14:40.125 --> 14:42.125
-You're on the waitlist?
-Yeah, I'm on the waitlist.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.708
I'm gonna be like… Yeah.

14:43.791 --> 14:48.875
Anyway, ladies, it is time
for our not-so-Secret Santa!

14:51.541 --> 14:52.916
Sit, sit, sit. Everybody sit.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.333
Sit, sit!

14:54.416 --> 14:56.458
I thought it was a…
I thought it was a <i>Secret </i>Santa.

14:56.541 --> 14:58.625
-I don't know.

14:58.708 --> 15:01.500
-I thought it was a Secret Santa.
-No, it's not.

15:01.583 --> 15:04.541
Okay,
I know what you all wanted, so Jill.

15:04.625 --> 15:06.541
-Thank you!
-It's not a secret?

15:06.625 --> 15:07.833
Thank you.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.541
I mean, we already know
what everybody wants, so…

15:10.625 --> 15:12.583
-Kathy.
-Thank you. Thank you.

15:12.666 --> 15:14.750
Are we excited? So, Jill…

15:14.833 --> 15:16.500
Thank you. Thank you.

15:16.583 --> 15:20.541
-Yes, and Cassidy.
-Thank you.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.875
Oh, you're welcome,
and this one's for Lisa.

15:23.958 --> 15:25.000
Love you.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.291
Oh my gosh, look at this wrapping!

15:27.375 --> 15:29.291
And this one's for you, Stacey.

15:30.458 --> 15:31.625
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

15:31.708 --> 15:32.708
Thanks, Gina.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.208
'Kay. Open them, open 'em already!

15:42.916 --> 15:45.458
-Oh my goodness, I love this stuff.
-Oh, no.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.166
You're welcome!

15:49.250 --> 15:50.750
-Gina!
-Thank you!

15:50.833 --> 15:52.500
Oh! You found it!

15:52.583 --> 15:56.166
-Have you tried this before?
-No. I've seen the commercials…

15:56.666 --> 15:57.916
I love this.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.291
-Oh, okay.
-Amazing.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.375
-It's that…
-Alo Glo.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.083
Yeah, yeah, I know.

16:05.166 --> 16:07.708
Anyway, it's so expensive,
and you can't get it anywhere,

16:07.791 --> 16:09.833
so… you're welcome, everybody!

16:09.916 --> 16:11.791
…having an orgasm.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.541
So beautiful, I know.
It's so incredible. I know.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.583
This one's for you, Gina.

16:20.125 --> 16:20.958
Oh!

16:22.833 --> 16:23.833
-That is huge.
-Wow.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.791
That <i>is </i>huge. I know all about the huge.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.166
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.666
-It's all about the huge.
-What is in the huge box?

16:29.750 --> 16:30.583
Okay.

16:30.666 --> 16:34.791
Open it, open it, open it!

16:34.875 --> 16:37.166
Open it, open it!

16:39.166 --> 16:41.250
-Open it!
-Okay!

16:41.333 --> 16:43.458
I guess I'll open it!

16:43.541 --> 16:47.125
Oh, what is it in here?

16:47.875 --> 16:48.791
Oh, I don't…

16:48.875 --> 16:51.041
I don't quite know what to, um…

16:51.750 --> 16:53.750
-…say or…
-Hey, I'll help ya.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.791
-He's not gonna hurt ya.
-…do.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.375
-Is it real?
-Oh yeah, it's real.

17:03.375 --> 17:04.208
-Here.

17:04.708 --> 17:07.041
-You killed this thing?
-Well, yeah, I shot him.

17:07.125 --> 17:10.541
And then I skinned him, and I, you know,
took out his insides so he wouldn't rot,

17:10.625 --> 17:13.000
and then, you know,
you just wash 'em up real good,

17:13.083 --> 17:15.541
and then, you know, I sewed him back up.

17:15.625 --> 17:19.291
Oh, but the insides
are just Styrofoam and some wires.

17:19.375 --> 17:22.875
That's really… Oh, and the eyes
are really cool glass beads.

17:23.708 --> 17:24.583
Right. Okay.

17:24.666 --> 17:26.250
You can love him forever.

17:26.333 --> 17:27.458
It's… Okay.

17:27.541 --> 17:29.541
Okay. Um…

17:31.333 --> 17:33.958
-Thank you, Stacey.
-You're welcome.

17:35.458 --> 17:39.666
I think I'm just gonna put him
right back here in his… his house,

17:39.750 --> 17:40.625
and cover him up.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.708
-Oh my God, that's disgusting.
-Mm.

17:42.791 --> 17:45.750
Just… get him
out of the way a little.

17:45.833 --> 17:49.666
-Stick him a bit out of the way.
-That's a good idea, G.

17:49.750 --> 17:50.916
Um…

17:51.500 --> 17:53.625
-Unusual.
-Wow, that's <i>very </i>unusual.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.416
How about that glow, ladies?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.166
-I mean, come on!

17:59.250 --> 18:02.541
It's so expensive,
and they rarely have it in stock.

18:02.625 --> 18:05.041
-You can't get it anywhere.
-I know!

18:05.125 --> 18:07.666
-Where did you get it?
-I'm not telling! I am…

18:13.583 --> 18:15.041
It's kinda scientific.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.875
The deeper you rub it…

18:25.166 --> 18:26.375
Oh, wow, okay.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.708
Do you feel that?

18:32.541 --> 18:33.708
Amazing.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.458
Oh my gosh. Yeah.

18:38.916 --> 18:40.958
Wow. Wow.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.166
So soothing!

19:06.416 --> 19:07.416
You feel that?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.541
Yeah, I feel it. It's really warm.

19:10.916 --> 19:11.875
Oh shit.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.541
S… Stacey, your… your face.

19:14.625 --> 19:15.750
-What?

19:15.833 --> 19:18.333
-Oh.
-It's… It's… It's warm.

19:18.416 --> 19:19.750
Yeah, no, it's red.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.250
-Your skin is red.
-Oh my God.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.875
-What?
-Your skin is red.

19:22.958 --> 19:26.208
-It's red?
-It's really red. It's gross.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.458
-Yeah.
-It's bad?

19:27.541 --> 19:29.000
-Yeah.
-It's not good.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.916
-It's bad. It's angry.
-It's pretty bad.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.166
Oh my God.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.125
-Is it…
-Like a rash.

19:36.083 --> 19:39.041
Thanks for the ice pack.
I'll bring it to the bank.

19:39.125 --> 19:40.083
Oh, no.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.583
No, no, no. You keep it.

19:43.208 --> 19:44.916
Sorry I ruined everything.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.791
Really, you didn't. It… It's fine.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.916
Look, it's so cold. Go home.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.333
Merry Chris… tmas.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.875
I think you're allergic, hon.

20:13.041 --> 20:16.416
Of course I have to be allergic
to the best lotion in the world.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.291
If it was the best lotion in the world,

20:18.375 --> 20:20.791
it wouldn't do that to your face now,
would it?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.708
It doesn't do this to anybody else's face.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.166
Well, you're sensitive.

20:26.833 --> 20:28.708
You have sensitive skin, Stace.

20:29.583 --> 20:33.416
You remember that lavender perfume
you wanted for Christmas last year?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.791
The one that made your neck all splotchy.

20:38.166 --> 20:39.041
It's just me.

20:39.625 --> 20:40.750
I have a bad face.

20:41.291 --> 20:43.833
A stupid, ugly, bad face.

20:44.541 --> 20:45.375
'Ey.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.166
Enough o' that.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.041
-<i>Morning, girl.</i>

22:18.000 --> 22:19.250
<i>Ah, look at me.</i>

<i>how they don't look at you.</i>

23:10.375 --> 23:11.416
<i>Let's fix it.</i>

23:13.583 --> 23:15.541
What the heck is happening?

23:16.833 --> 23:18.500
<i>Come on, Stacey.</i>

23:20.375 --> 23:22.708
<i>Isn't this what you've always wanted?</i>

<i>…change of mood, stiff joints,</i>

<i>…activities</i>

23:49.208 --> 23:50.875
<i>But it's all worth it.</i>

23:50.958 --> 23:52.500
This is so stupid!

23:53.208 --> 23:54.833
What is this?

23:56.041 --> 23:58.125
<i>What's so funny, Stacey?</i>

23:58.708 --> 24:01.250
No, I… I'm not talking to the TV.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.750
<i>You're not talking to a TV.</i>
<i>You're talking to me.</i>

24:07.958 --> 24:11.458
<i>I can give you the brand-new you,</i>
<i>and that's not all.</i>

24:12.250 --> 24:14.041
<i>I can give you peace of mind.</i>

<i>I can get you a seat at the table.</i>

<i>Alo Glo can fix you,</i>

<i>I see the Alo Glo right there</i>
<i>on the table in front of you,</i>

24:25.333 --> 24:26.958
<i>but I don't see you using it.</i>

24:28.500 --> 24:33.208
I already used it, and it didn't work.
I mean, look at me. I'm all red.

24:33.291 --> 24:37.291
<i>Well, you have to use the whole bottle,</i>
<i>and you're gonna need more.</i>

24:37.375 --> 24:39.916
<i>You want a full body transformation,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

24:41.583 --> 24:45.041
Yeah, but… it stings.
It's making me all itchy.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.833
<i>Of course it stings.</i>

24:46.916 --> 24:49.083
<i>It hurts when it works.</i>

24:49.583 --> 24:52.416
<i>Skin itches when it is healing.</i>

24:52.500 --> 24:55.208
<i>The more it itches,</i>
<i>the more healing it is doing.</i>

24:55.291 --> 24:58.125
<i>You have a lot of healing to do, Stacey.</i>

24:59.250 --> 25:00.750
<i>Just pick up the phone.</i>

25:02.125 --> 25:03.916
<i>Think about it, Stacey.</i>

25:04.000 --> 25:06.541
<i>It's such a shame to have to be you,</i>

25:06.625 --> 25:10.041
<i>because you're not someone</i>
<i>anyone wants to have around.</i>

25:10.541 --> 25:13.458
<i>You're not someone anyone wants to see.</i>

25:13.958 --> 25:18.291
<i>But soon, you will be the things</i>
<i>you always dreamed of.</i>

25:19.041 --> 25:22.916
<i>True acceptance, harmony,</i>
<i>peace, and divinity.</i>

25:23.000 --> 25:24.916
<i>All that stuff is a lie.</i>

25:26.041 --> 25:28.416
<i>We all just wanna be good-looking.</i>

25:29.958 --> 25:32.375
<i>So now step across to the other side,</i>

25:32.458 --> 25:36.875
<i>step out of your skin,</i>
<i>and into your Alo Glo.</i>

25:36.958 --> 25:38.750
<i>Enter your credit card number.</i>

<i>We look forward</i>
<i>to meeting the brand-new you.</i>

<i>…tells your body</i>
<i>to make a new you.</i>

25:52.166 --> 25:56.291
<i>Remember, it doesn't work</i>
<i>if you don't use it.</i>

27:52.166 --> 27:53.208
Stace?

27:54.291 --> 27:55.833
Did I hear a knock?

27:58.333 --> 28:00.166
Hey, aren't you supposed to be at work?

28:00.791 --> 28:02.166
I called in sick.

28:02.708 --> 28:03.583
Oh.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.083
Whoa, your face!

28:08.666 --> 28:09.875
It's not that bad.

28:10.708 --> 28:11.583
Yeah.

28:12.541 --> 28:13.833
It looks pretty bad.

28:15.541 --> 28:17.166
Mostly just itches now.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.708
I don't think you should use
that lotion anymore.

28:22.625 --> 28:25.458
It's a process.
It's healing when it itches.

28:27.333 --> 28:30.291
You know how much money
they make off all those creams

28:30.375 --> 28:31.833
and powders and lotions?

28:33.291 --> 28:36.125
All from making you think
that there's somethin' wrong with you.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.125
Something <i>is </i>wrong with me.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.833
There's nothin' wrong with you.

28:42.541 --> 28:43.583
Nothin' at all.

28:43.666 --> 28:47.333
If there's somethin' wrong with you,
well, there's somethin' wrong with me too.

28:47.833 --> 28:48.666
No.

28:49.625 --> 28:50.625
You're fine.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.000
You'll always be fine. You wanna know why?

28:54.750 --> 28:55.958
'Cause you're a man.

28:56.916 --> 29:02.041
Men can be fat and hairy and ugly
and impolite and old, and nobody cares.

29:02.125 --> 29:05.125
Everybody likes you.
Everybody wants to talk to you.

29:05.750 --> 29:08.250
Yeah, well,
I don't wanna talk to everyone.

29:08.750 --> 29:10.458
I just wanna talk to you.

29:12.416 --> 29:15.375
That's nice. Really great.
'Preciate it, honey.

29:17.791 --> 29:19.041
But I am changing.

29:20.625 --> 29:21.791
It is happening.

29:22.708 --> 29:24.500
So please be supportive.

29:26.541 --> 29:29.583
"Be… supportive."

29:29.666 --> 29:31.833
That's what I said.
I said, "Be supportive."

29:33.291 --> 29:34.208
Hmm.

Stop.

He says it's working.

<i>But you have to trust me.</i>

32:51.833 --> 32:53.708
<i>You have to trust the formula.</i>

32:54.833 --> 32:59.291
<i>And I feel that maybe you don't… trust me.</i>

33:01.875 --> 33:03.333
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.958
Hold on, come back.

33:05.041 --> 33:05.875
Hold on!

33:06.541 --> 33:07.666
Please come back!

33:08.708 --> 33:09.541
Hello?

33:10.708 --> 33:11.875
-Hello?

33:14.375 --> 33:16.291
<i>You know what trust is, Stacey?</i>

33:17.708 --> 33:18.541
Yeah.

33:20.291 --> 33:21.375
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

33:30.375 --> 33:32.541
<i>You know, you have to go all the way.</i>

33:36.166 --> 33:37.208
<i>Any questions?</i>

33:42.583 --> 33:43.416
Will it hurt?

33:46.833 --> 33:47.666
<i>You tell me.</i>

33:49.000 --> 33:51.208
<i>Does it hurt when they exclude you?</i>

33:53.041 --> 33:54.500
<i>When they stare at you?</i>

33:55.875 --> 33:58.708
<i>When they point and laugh and whisper?</i>

34:01.166 --> 34:02.000
Yeah.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.291
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>what it feels like to be pretty?</i>

34:08.083 --> 34:09.458
-Yeah.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

34:11.458 --> 34:13.000
<i>Are you with me, Stacey?</i>

34:18.708 --> 34:21.041
-Yeah.
<i>-Yeah, you're with me.</i>

34:21.125 --> 34:22.916
-I'm with you.
<i>-You're with me. That's great.</i>

34:23.000 --> 34:24.541
-I'm with you.
<i>-That's great.</i>

34:24.625 --> 34:27.458
<i>You are ready, Stacey. You're ready.</i>

34:27.541 --> 34:31.208
<i>You're ready to harness</i>
<i>the power of retinol and peptides.</i>

34:31.291 --> 34:35.000
<i>Let it in, Stacey.</i>
<i>It's already inside you.</i>

34:36.166 --> 34:37.333
What's inside me?

34:37.833 --> 34:40.208
<i>Your new life, the one you want.</i>

34:41.000 --> 34:44.041
<i>It's already growing, right there,</i>

34:44.750 --> 34:46.208
<i>under your skin.</i>

34:50.458 --> 34:51.708
It's under my skin?

34:55.208 --> 34:56.250
<i>Use more Alo Glo.</i>

35:52.666 --> 35:53.708
Mm.

36:05.041 --> 36:05.875
Keith?

36:07.750 --> 36:08.625
Mm?

36:09.666 --> 36:11.958
Can you stay home from work tomorrow?

36:14.875 --> 36:17.958
No. You know I can't do that.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.541
Stace?

38:15.416 --> 38:16.333
You home?

38:22.250 --> 38:23.083
Stace?

38:26.166 --> 38:27.041
You hungry?

38:37.833 --> 38:38.833
Ah.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.291
Ah!

39:16.625 --> 39:18.375
<i>Be one of the lucky callers--</i>

39:18.458 --> 39:19.500
<i>That's it.</i>

39:20.166 --> 39:21.083
<i>That's the way they…</i>

39:21.166 --> 39:22.083
Stace?

39:22.166 --> 39:23.958
-<i>You owe me six bits.</i>
-<i> Wait a minute.</i>

39:24.041 --> 39:25.583
<i>One-Eyed Jacks </i>is on.

39:26.291 --> 39:27.125
Honey?

39:38.166 --> 39:41.500
I'll come down,
but please don't say anything,

39:41.583 --> 39:43.958
because I already know
what you're gonna say.

39:47.791 --> 39:48.750
Okay.

39:48.833 --> 39:51.083
<i>You get up, you big tub of guts.</i>

39:52.333 --> 39:54.291
<i>¡Quítate tú o te mato a ti también!</i>

39:54.375 --> 39:57.166
<i>¡Los mato! ¡Los mato esta vez!</i>

40:07.083 --> 40:07.916
It's healing.

40:09.625 --> 40:11.083
It's not healing.

40:11.666 --> 40:13.541
Hon, it's getting worse.

40:14.541 --> 40:16.125
We gotta go see Dr. Sneider.

40:16.208 --> 40:19.291
Oh, no, no, no. I… I feel fine. Really.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.875
Yeah, it's…
This is just part of the process.

40:21.958 --> 40:24.083
It gets worse before it gets better.

40:24.791 --> 40:28.083
It's not an allergic reaction
like you thought.

40:28.166 --> 40:31.208
That's the thing. It's…
It's in my skin. It's growing.

40:31.291 --> 40:32.750
-That's how it works.
-Stacey.

40:32.833 --> 40:34.708
-It's working.
-Are you hearing yourself?

40:34.791 --> 40:36.708
I can feel it working.

40:37.291 --> 40:40.500
Why can't you just be excited for me, huh?
You know, I…

40:41.416 --> 40:43.416
This is what's gonna fix me.

40:43.916 --> 40:45.458
It's transformative!

40:46.916 --> 40:48.875
You don't need to be fixed.

40:50.375 --> 40:54.625
You just don't understand how it works.
There's peptides and retinol.

40:54.708 --> 40:58.916
It's a groundbreaking
patented six-ingredient formula.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.625
Have you had anything to eat today, hon?

41:05.125 --> 41:05.958
Huh?

41:07.125 --> 41:08.541
Have a pig in a blanket.

41:12.458 --> 41:13.375
Come on.

41:13.458 --> 41:14.791
<i>How'd it happen?</i>

41:14.875 --> 41:16.041
<i>We took to scufflin',</i>

41:16.125 --> 41:19.708
<i>and… he come out from behind there</i>
<i>with that scattergun.</i>

41:21.083 --> 41:21.916
Yeah.

41:22.750 --> 41:23.583
Yeah.

41:25.625 --> 41:26.458
See?

41:28.083 --> 41:29.166
That's better.

41:29.250 --> 41:30.791
<i>He was always askin' for it.</i>

41:33.083 --> 41:34.458
You… You gotta…

41:35.416 --> 41:38.083
You gotta put your worries down sometimes.

41:38.166 --> 41:39.000
Huh?

41:41.916 --> 41:43.541
There's nothing wrong with you.

41:44.250 --> 41:45.708
You are lovely.

41:46.958 --> 41:48.166
Inside and out.

41:51.041 --> 41:55.125
When you say "inside,"
it means I'm not lovely on the outside.

41:55.208 --> 41:56.708
No, the…

41:56.791 --> 41:57.875
You are.

41:57.958 --> 42:00.000
It… You're lovely everywhere.

42:01.333 --> 42:04.500
Then why do I want
to take off all of my skin

42:04.583 --> 42:06.833
and throw it in the garbage?!

42:11.083 --> 42:13.708
-Where are you goin'?
-I'm going downstairs!

42:13.791 --> 42:15.875
You better not use more o' that stuff.

42:16.375 --> 42:17.750
I mean it, Stace!

45:11.208 --> 45:13.375
<i>How'd you find me here?</i>

45:14.583 --> 45:16.000
What in the hell?

45:16.583 --> 45:18.916
<i>-I don't know how…</i>
-Are you kiddin' me?

45:21.208 --> 45:23.500
What in the world has gotten into you?!

45:24.000 --> 45:24.875
No.

45:24.958 --> 45:27.791
I'm so excited.

45:27.875 --> 45:29.625
I've never felt better.

45:32.666 --> 45:35.875
-This isn't you, Stace.
-You shouldn't judge people, Keith.

45:35.958 --> 45:37.458
It's negative and mean.

45:37.541 --> 45:39.416
<i>I'll figure that out when…</i>

45:39.500 --> 45:40.333
No.

45:41.958 --> 45:47.583
You… are Stacey Elizabeth Chapman.

45:48.250 --> 45:49.958
You know what I love about you?

45:50.041 --> 45:51.916
You love to watch scary movies.

45:52.625 --> 45:55.833
Even though you're too scared to watch,
'cause then you can't sleep at night.

45:56.375 --> 45:57.375
You're so smart.

45:58.375 --> 45:59.750
You're so good at math.

46:00.666 --> 46:02.041
And you love nature.

46:02.791 --> 46:04.583
You love your taxidermy.

46:07.166 --> 46:08.000
Hmm?

46:08.083 --> 46:09.166
You're an artist.

46:09.791 --> 46:13.125
When other people see a dead animal,
you see somethin' special.

46:14.541 --> 46:15.833
Somethin' beautiful.

46:16.416 --> 46:17.833
You <i>make </i>it beautiful.

46:19.625 --> 46:20.625
You're kind.

46:22.750 --> 46:23.666
And funny.

46:25.166 --> 46:26.125
And thoughtful.

46:29.750 --> 46:31.500
And I think you're perfect.

46:34.250 --> 46:36.458
That's what's wrong with you, Keith.

46:37.375 --> 46:38.208
Enough!

46:41.000 --> 46:45.250
You are gonna stop
this nonsense right now.

46:45.333 --> 46:46.250
You hear me?

46:48.208 --> 46:52.250
It's just that you don't understand
what is happening to me.

46:52.833 --> 46:55.166
'Cause I'm tired, and I've had enough.

46:57.583 --> 46:59.750
It's too late, Keith.

47:01.208 --> 47:03.125
She's already here!

47:05.750 --> 47:06.583
Who?

47:08.125 --> 47:09.250
Who is here?

47:10.958 --> 47:12.041
Who is here?

47:13.500 --> 47:15.291
Once my transformation is complete…

47:15.875 --> 47:16.708
Enough!

47:17.958 --> 47:19.208
Okay, just calm down.

47:19.291 --> 47:21.708
There's no transformation!

47:23.708 --> 47:25.583
Okay. Okay.

47:29.333 --> 47:30.250
It's just that…

47:32.375 --> 47:34.583
you're not gonna change, are you?

47:37.375 --> 47:39.750
And you don't want me to change either.

47:40.416 --> 47:41.250
Do you?

47:41.333 --> 47:43.000
I don't want you to change.

47:43.916 --> 47:47.250
That's what I've been trying to tell you
until I'm blue in the face.

47:54.125 --> 47:55.750
-Dah!
-Agh!

48:00.583 --> 48:01.625
Ah…

48:02.208 --> 48:03.083
Ah.

48:05.166 --> 48:07.750
Ohhh. Oh.

48:08.958 --> 48:10.041
Huh…

48:10.125 --> 48:11.416
What the fuck, Stace?

48:13.291 --> 48:14.208
Oh.

48:16.291 --> 48:17.708
You stabbed me in the face.

48:26.416 --> 48:27.458
How deep is it?

48:29.166 --> 48:30.208
Huh?

48:30.291 --> 48:31.166
Hon…

48:31.666 --> 48:32.875
I'm sorry.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.250
Should I pull it out?

48:36.416 --> 48:37.750
I'm gonna pull it out.

48:38.333 --> 48:39.166
Okay.

48:41.375 --> 48:42.250
Ah.

48:43.083 --> 48:45.666
-Oh, jeez. Oh.
-Oh, I'm bleedin'.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.458
Oh no. Oh no.

48:49.333 --> 48:50.500
Is it bad?

48:51.333 --> 48:53.125
Yeah, it's pretty bad, honey.

48:54.333 --> 48:55.208
Oh.

48:56.708 --> 48:58.666
It's on my… It's on my glasses.

49:00.083 --> 49:02.291
Hon, this is… this is real bad.

49:03.333 --> 49:05.958
This is real bad. I…
I need a… I need a towel.

49:06.041 --> 49:08.041
-Will you go get me a towel, hon?
-Yeah.

49:09.375 --> 49:10.208
Huh?

49:10.750 --> 49:11.833
Okay.

49:11.916 --> 49:13.958
Oh. I'll use my radio.

49:14.458 --> 49:16.208
Yeah, okay.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.541
Dispatch? Dispatch?

49:29.625 --> 49:31.750
-<i>Copy, Chapman, go ahead.</i>
This… I…

49:32.375 --> 49:33.875
This is Officer Chapman.

49:34.375 --> 49:36.291
I have a 10-33--

49:36.375 --> 49:37.500
-Ah!

49:37.583 --> 49:38.416
-Ah.

49:38.500 --> 49:39.583
<i>Please respond, Chapman.</i>

49:39.666 --> 49:40.958
-Oh.
-Oh.

49:42.708 --> 49:45.041
<i>Line's open. Go ahead, Chapman, please.</i>

49:45.125 --> 49:46.500
-Ah.
-Mm.

49:46.583 --> 49:47.500
Agh.

49:48.166 --> 49:50.208
-Somethin' fell on me, hon.

49:50.291 --> 49:52.500
<i>Line's open. Go ahead, Chapman.</i>

49:53.500 --> 49:54.791
-Agh. Huh.

49:54.875 --> 49:56.083
Oh.

50:03.916 --> 50:05.291
Dah!

50:37.833 --> 50:39.958
<i>Now let's see the kind of stuff</i>
<i>you're made of.</i>

51:40.833 --> 51:41.791
Wha…

51:43.875 --> 51:44.875
Huh.

52:09.125 --> 52:10.000
Oh.

52:11.750 --> 52:12.583
Oh.

52:17.041 --> 52:18.250
Oh.

52:18.833 --> 52:20.041
Ah.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.500
Ah.

52:26.208 --> 52:27.208
Ah.

52:29.833 --> 52:31.416
Oh. Oh!

52:32.250 --> 52:33.791
Ah. Oh!

52:34.916 --> 52:36.166
Ahh!

52:36.250 --> 52:38.416
Oh. Oh.

52:40.500 --> 52:41.500
Ah.

52:43.416 --> 52:44.375
Oh.

52:46.041 --> 52:47.916
Oh! Oh!

52:48.000 --> 52:49.208
Oh-ah!

52:54.166 --> 52:55.125
Ah.

52:55.208 --> 52:56.750
Oh!

52:59.916 --> 53:01.041
Ah.

53:01.708 --> 53:03.000
Ah.

53:03.083 --> 53:04.291
Oh.

53:05.125 --> 53:06.083
Oh.

54:03.666 --> 54:04.583
Ah.

54:43.708 --> 54:45.500
Look, look! Look, look, look!

54:45.583 --> 54:46.541
Keith, look!

54:46.625 --> 54:48.958
Look, look! I told you, look, look!

54:49.583 --> 54:50.500
Look at me!

54:51.250 --> 54:52.083
See?

55:12.125 --> 55:12.958
Mmm.

56:38.791 --> 56:40.625
Bye, hon. Have a great day.

57:11.416 --> 57:13.291
No, no, you're not listening to me.

57:13.375 --> 57:16.708
Okay? He needs a father that talks to him
about what he's going through.

57:17.291 --> 57:19.083
Yeah, 'cause that's a father's job.

57:19.166 --> 57:20.333
Uh-huh! Yeah.

57:20.416 --> 57:21.666
…gery and it went wrong.

57:21.750 --> 57:22.708
-No!
-Yeah.

57:22.791 --> 57:24.416
Basically he doesn't have a dick anymore.

57:24.500 --> 57:25.750
Tell me how you feel.

57:26.500 --> 57:28.833
Yeah, no, it's not therapy. It's just…

57:30.000 --> 57:32.458
Wh… What's wrong with Mr. Rogers?

57:32.541 --> 57:34.750
You know what?
Don't be so fucking primitive.

57:35.333 --> 57:37.208
Oh, yes, you are.

57:37.750 --> 57:38.625
Oh-ho.

57:39.708 --> 57:40.916
Miss Chapman?!

57:42.125 --> 57:43.375
Good morning, Ronnie.

57:44.166 --> 57:47.500
-You look… sensational!
-Oh, thank you.

57:47.583 --> 57:49.583
-God!
-Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

57:49.666 --> 57:51.000
Is that Stacey?

57:51.083 --> 57:53.250
-I'll call you later.
-You seeing what I'm seeing?

57:53.333 --> 57:55.416
I don't know. What are you seeing?

57:55.500 --> 57:56.958
That's what I just asked you.

58:02.250 --> 58:03.125
Oh my God.

58:04.500 --> 58:06.083
It's like when you're in the desert,

58:06.166 --> 58:09.000
and, like,
you're really hot and dehydrated,

58:09.083 --> 58:10.625
and this thing appears before you--

58:10.708 --> 58:13.416
-It's a mirage, it's a mirage.
-It's like a mirage.

58:13.500 --> 58:16.083
We're not in the desert, Jill.

58:17.833 --> 58:19.458
She's an angel.

58:20.500 --> 58:21.416
Oh, wow.

58:23.166 --> 58:24.000
Hi, ladies.

58:24.083 --> 58:25.291
Hi!

58:30.083 --> 58:33.041
Oh my God, you smell so good.
She smells so good.

58:33.750 --> 58:35.291
-Wow.
-It's so exciting!

58:35.375 --> 58:37.833
-Oh my God, it's so exciting.
-You look gorgeous.

58:37.916 --> 58:40.125
Just unreal.

58:41.875 --> 58:44.083
-It's not the way she regularly smells.
-Ah.

58:44.583 --> 58:48.666
This is just… so strange.

58:48.750 --> 58:50.416
Stacey, hi.

58:50.500 --> 58:51.541
Hi.

58:51.625 --> 58:52.458
Hi, Gina.

58:53.375 --> 58:55.708
Did you… get something done?

58:56.541 --> 58:58.291
I sure did.

58:58.375 --> 59:00.916
-I changed my hair. It's shorter.
-Oh!

59:01.000 --> 59:03.750
-Do you like it?
-You look amazing.

59:03.833 --> 59:05.541
-Mm, I do, don't I?
-Yes.

59:05.625 --> 59:07.750
Like, so amazing.

59:07.833 --> 59:10.333
-Mmm.
-How did you, um…

59:10.416 --> 59:11.416
Um…

59:11.916 --> 59:14.583
I mean, it's just… it's… it's… it's so…

59:14.666 --> 59:16.583
-Different?
-Different, yes, it's different.

59:16.666 --> 59:17.708
It's different.

59:17.791 --> 59:21.083
Yeah, I mean you look… really…

59:21.166 --> 59:22.791
I look really…

59:23.458 --> 59:24.291
what?

59:24.833 --> 59:25.833
Tell me.

59:25.916 --> 59:27.000
You look

59:27.583 --> 59:28.833
really beautiful.

59:28.916 --> 59:30.041
-Yeah.
-Aw.

59:32.333 --> 59:34.041
Thank you!

59:34.125 --> 59:37.041
-Like, I mean, it's surreal.
-So hard to…

59:37.125 --> 59:39.041
You can look closer if you want.

59:39.125 --> 59:41.208
Just get a really close look.

59:41.958 --> 59:42.791
Okay.

59:45.541 --> 59:46.583
Is this new?

59:47.166 --> 59:49.541
No, I've always had it. Do you like it?

59:51.250 --> 59:52.083
Yeah.

59:52.750 --> 59:54.666
Hm. Mmm. Mm-hmm.

59:57.958 --> 1:00:02.416
So, did you hear
Donald Crenshaw got a DUI?

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.916
He drove his car into a snowbank.

1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.875
Oh my God, his poor wife
must be so embarrassed.

1:00:07.958 --> 1:00:09.958
Please. She is no saint.

1:00:10.041 --> 1:00:12.583
Yeah, no,
Judy's a total lush, a day drinker.

1:00:12.666 --> 1:00:13.875
Glug-glug. Oh yeah.

1:00:13.958 --> 1:00:17.291
Always has schnapps on her breath
when she's cashing her checks.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:19.708
Secondhand schnapps.

1:00:19.791 --> 1:00:22.916
Well, speaking of schnapps,
we should all go to Giuseppe's for drinks.

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.083
Yeah! Happy hour!

1:00:25.166 --> 1:00:27.000
They make the best gimlets.

1:00:27.083 --> 1:00:28.458
-They do, yeah.
-Yeah.

1:00:28.541 --> 1:00:32.541
You're gonna love it, Stacey.
They have a Cobb salad to die for.

1:00:32.625 --> 1:00:33.833
I love Cobb salad.

1:00:33.916 --> 1:00:34.750
Mmm.
