00:05.318 --> 00:06.657
Stop, please!

00:06.692 --> 00:08.607
I don't know
where he is!

00:08.642 --> 00:10.015
He's your brother.

00:10.050 --> 00:11.119
Of course you do.

00:11.154 --> 00:12.448
(sobbing)
I... I don't know!

00:12.483 --> 00:13.564
- I don't know.
- _

00:13.599 --> 00:16.391
(groaning)
I would tell you!

00:16.426 --> 00:19.869
- I would tell you. Please.
- Shh...

00:19.904 --> 00:21.279
- (sobbing) Please.
- I told you...

00:21.314 --> 00:22.874
- We had to try.
- Did we?

00:22.909 --> 00:24.298
He's not even close
with his brother.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.647
We had to try.

00:25.682 --> 00:27.256
(man)
So now what?

00:27.291 --> 00:28.399
N-N-No, no, no, no...

00:28.434 --> 00:30.033
(silencer gunshot)

00:35.328 --> 00:36.461
Thank you.

- Yes. Yeah.

01:02.671 --> 01:05.432
For the rock-bottom
price of 35 coffees

01:05.467 --> 01:08.674
he let me...
mess with his sign.

01:08.676 --> 01:10.358
What if I didn't notice?

01:10.393 --> 01:12.030
I knew you would.

01:13.956 --> 01:16.901
Wylie Dufresne is doing
a pop-up thing tonight.

01:16.936 --> 01:17.799
- David...
- I just know you've been

01:17.834 --> 01:18.796
craving those
pigs-in-a-blanket

01:18.831 --> 01:20.851
- since Alder closed and...
- I told you, I...

01:20.886 --> 01:23.980
I have... I have
obligations that I have...

01:24.015 --> 01:25.975
Okay, but the thing is...

01:27.985 --> 01:32.372
(chuckling)
I'm madly in love with you.

01:32.407 --> 01:33.480
And, unless I'm crazy,

01:33.515 --> 01:35.467
I'm pretty sure you
feel the same way.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.203
(sighs)

01:38.353 --> 01:40.242
David, our...

01:40.335 --> 01:42.991
our timing is...
is just off.

01:43.026 --> 01:47.201
I... I... I have these
responsibilities, I'm...

01:47.293 --> 01:49.140
I'm working the biggest
case of my life.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.904
So, if you solve
the case, then...

01:50.939 --> 01:52.272
I'm sorry.

01:55.388 --> 01:56.721
(car horn honks)

02:05.432 --> 02:07.118
(helicopter buzzing)

02:07.153 --> 02:08.455
What is that?

02:08.491 --> 02:12.525
Oh, this is a very
expensive...

02:12.560 --> 02:14.966
(paper tearing)
very sensitive

02:15.001 --> 02:16.702
surveillance device.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.547
If you stick it
inside of a lamp

02:19.582 --> 02:20.739
or a light switch,

02:20.774 --> 02:22.650
it can power itself
from radial heat,

02:22.685 --> 02:26.885
so it continues to
broadcast indefinitely.

02:26.931 --> 02:28.727
So it's a bug?

02:28.842 --> 02:30.823
It's a work of art.

02:30.983 --> 02:33.999
And I want it inside
Jane's safe house.

02:34.034 --> 02:34.846
No.

02:34.881 --> 02:37.157
You don't say no to me.

02:37.192 --> 02:39.842
See, I want this up and
running inside of 24 hours,

02:39.877 --> 02:42.928
or you're not gonna like
the tone of my voice anymore.

02:45.893 --> 02:47.268
(Weller)
What do you got?

02:47.303 --> 02:49.716
All right, so when we were
first inputting these tattoos

02:49.751 --> 02:51.345
into the database,
I noticed there were a lot

02:51.380 --> 02:54.553
of these really small, stray
letters all over Jane's body.

02:54.588 --> 02:56.584
They were hidden
in other designs,

02:56.619 --> 02:58.508
but they had
the same font.

02:58.543 --> 03:02.740
So I figured they were
an anagram for something.

03:02.775 --> 03:05.483
"A wrenchess leek knell."

03:05.518 --> 03:08.193
"Leach kneel elks wrens."

03:08.195 --> 03:09.516
There's about
1,000 of them.

03:09.551 --> 03:11.212
The rest of them
are mostly just nonsense.

03:11.247 --> 03:13.735
And what you just said
wasn't nonsense?

03:13.770 --> 03:16.190
We inputted every
possible variation.

03:16.225 --> 03:18.990
- And one of them hit?
- Yep, just this morning.

03:19.094 --> 03:21.435
AshwellCreekKennels.

03:21.470 --> 03:23.325
The user name for
an online puppy forum

03:23.360 --> 03:25.992
called Ruff Around the Ears.

03:26.027 --> 03:27.083
(Jane)
I don't understand.

03:27.118 --> 03:29.254
A puppy message board?

03:29.289 --> 03:30.218
Doesn't really line up

03:30.253 --> 03:32.218
with where the other
tattoos have led.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.909
Criminals coop sites
like these all the time

03:33.944 --> 03:35.702
and communicate because
they're unmonitored.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.037
What was
the thread about?

03:37.072 --> 03:38.348
Uh, it's in response
to someone

03:38.383 --> 03:40.321
posting about
a lost puppy.

03:40.356 --> 03:42.255
"Could be anywhere
in the United States.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.712
Not tagged.
Massive reward for any leads."

03:44.747 --> 03:46.643
Then AshwellCreekKennels
responds,

03:46.678 --> 03:49.290
"We have the entire litter,
hopefully the exact one

03:49.325 --> 03:50.456
"you're looking for.

03:50.491 --> 03:53.856
Will need to provide collar
as proof of ownership."

03:53.891 --> 03:55.035
If they're not
talking about dogs,

03:55.070 --> 03:56.356
what are they
looking for?

03:56.391 --> 03:57.604
Still trying
to figure that out.

03:57.639 --> 03:59.482
But, as the thread
progresses,

03:59.517 --> 04:01.691
AshwellCreekKennels
suggests that they

04:01.726 --> 04:05.631
check out a open house
in Staten Island at 2 p.m.

04:05.666 --> 04:08.465
Let's check it out.
Nice work.

04:12.829 --> 04:15.230
(Zapata) I think this place
is abandoned.

04:17.884 --> 04:21.086
Don't look like much
of an open house to me.

04:22.536 --> 04:25.872

04:38.719 --> 04:39.785

What is this?
Who are they?

05:21.795 --> 05:23.195
Don't know.

05:23.230 --> 05:24.997
It's pretty hard
to question them now.

05:41.752 --> 05:43.268
It's all clear up there.

05:43.303 --> 05:45.359
How'd you know he was
coming down the stairs?

05:45.415 --> 05:48.095
I understood
what she was saying.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.071
I think it was Bulgarian.

05:50.106 --> 05:51.964
Chinese and Bulgarian.

You must have
really got around.

05:53.669 --> 05:55.102

05:58.565 --> 06:00.774
When we came in,
she was over there.

06:10.941 --> 06:13.190
Footprint tells me she's
looking for something.

06:18.151 --> 06:19.585
(grunting)

06:23.880 --> 06:25.514
Well, what is it?

06:26.577 --> 06:28.301
Two tickets to a gala.

06:30.133 --> 06:31.800
And some sort of pin.

06:33.725 --> 06:35.642
These guys are pros.

06:35.677 --> 06:38.645
We found a duffel upstairs
with about a dozen passports

06:38.714 --> 06:40.028
for each of them.

06:40.063 --> 06:43.459
These are the best fakes
that I have ever seen.

06:43.494 --> 06:46.299
One set was used to go
in and out of Barcelona,

06:46.334 --> 06:47.261
about a week ago.

06:47.296 --> 06:48.188
Barcelona?

06:48.223 --> 06:49.321
I flagged them.

06:49.356 --> 06:50.555
Because they entered
and exited

06:50.590 --> 06:52.517
on the exact day
an American tourist

06:52.552 --> 06:54.218
was abducted
and brutally tortured

06:54.253 --> 06:56.238
when he was on vacation
with his family.

06:56.273 --> 06:58.918
His name...
was Perry Byrne.

06:58.953 --> 07:01.454
(woman)
Where's your brother?!

07:01.489 --> 07:03.023
Any idea why they
tortured him?

07:03.058 --> 07:06.256
His brother...
is Robert Byrne.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.771
The accountant who turned
States evidence

07:07.806 --> 07:09.430
and put
Victor Morello away.

07:09.465 --> 07:11.753
Mob boss... not a nice guy.

07:11.788 --> 07:13.669
(Reade) The people at the house
are good with guns,

07:13.704 --> 07:14.913
and they have
a lot of passports.

07:14.948 --> 07:16.620
I feel like they're
hired assassins.

07:16.655 --> 07:18.884
They're looking
for Robert Byrne.

07:18.977 --> 07:20.559
He could be
the "lost puppy."

07:20.594 --> 07:22.249
Morello wants him dead
for putting him in prison

07:22.284 --> 07:25.299
and dismantling his entire crew,
but he's in WITSEC.

07:25.334 --> 07:26.540
WITSEC?

07:26.575 --> 07:27.519
Witness Security Program.

07:27.554 --> 07:29.650
(Patterson) The assassins must be
trying to buy his location

07:29.685 --> 07:31.164
from AshwellCreekKennels.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.439
This all just happened.
How is this a tattoo?

07:33.474 --> 07:34.406
I don't know yet,

07:34.441 --> 07:37.740
but we need to alert
US Marshals immediately.

07:59.394 --> 08:00.795
Allie.

08:01.997 --> 08:03.942
Hello, Kurt.

08:03.977 --> 08:04.894
You're
a marshal now?

08:04.929 --> 08:06.895
Yeah, I was looking
for a change.

08:06.930 --> 08:08.791
Ohh, it's been a minute.

08:08.826 --> 08:10.971
And your sister and Sawyer?
How old is he now?

08:10.973 --> 08:12.269
He's nine.

08:12.304 --> 08:14.069
- Oh, wow.
- I know.

08:14.143 --> 08:15.482
(chuckling)

08:15.517 --> 08:16.880
Uh, this is...
this is Jane.

08:16.915 --> 08:18.652
She's working with us
as a consultant.

08:18.687 --> 08:20.060
Allison Knight,
US Marshals.

08:20.095 --> 08:21.248
Nice to meet you.

08:21.328 --> 08:22.424
We picked up
chatter

08:22.459 --> 08:24.230
in an online forum

08:24.265 --> 08:25.663
that points to an outsider

08:25.698 --> 08:27.992
knowing the location
of Robert Byrne,

08:28.027 --> 08:30.264
who we believe is under
government protection.

08:30.327 --> 08:31.081
He is.

08:31.116 --> 08:32.638
What concerns us
is the phrasing

08:32.673 --> 08:34.383
of the correspondence.

08:34.418 --> 08:35.663
It alludes to the poster

08:35.698 --> 08:38.488
having information
on "the entire litter."

08:38.523 --> 08:41.966
Could other Morello witnesses
be compromised?

08:42.746 --> 08:45.382
Not just Morello witnesses.

08:45.701 --> 08:48.442
We've been keeping this
quiet for obvious reasons,

08:48.477 --> 08:50.746
but we had
a WITSEC data breach.

08:50.805 --> 08:52.812
- You were hacked?
- Just over 2,000 witnesses

08:52.847 --> 08:55.038
had their new identities
and locations compromised.

08:55.073 --> 08:56.771
- Excuse me?
- We're doing the best we can

08:56.806 --> 08:58.410
to relocate them and
get them new backgrounds,

08:58.445 --> 09:00.141
but, as you can imagine,
it's gonna take some time.

09:00.176 --> 09:01.895
You need to relocate
Robert Byrne

09:01.930 --> 09:03.894
and his entire family,
immediately.

09:03.929 --> 09:05.787
We are... but it's gonna
take at least six months

09:05.822 --> 09:07.119
to reassign the others.

09:07.154 --> 09:08.416
We need to find out
whoever's doing this

09:08.451 --> 09:10.752
and shut it down... <i>now.</i>

09:11.458 --> 09:13.781
So "the entire litter"
probably means

09:13.816 --> 09:15.130
the hacked WITSEC list.

09:15.165 --> 09:17.088
- That would be very, very bad.
- (Weller) Yeah.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.801
Well, at least we know where the
the exchange is gonna happen.

09:20.086 --> 09:22.853
At this fundraiser,
today at 5 p.m.

09:22.888 --> 09:23.927
Hold this.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.111
I have a theory.

09:25.154 --> 09:28.115
We found this in a hidden
pocket in the duffel.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.481
We think it might be worth
as much as $6 million.

09:30.516 --> 09:32.592
- (Weller whistles)
- "Will need to provide collar

09:32.627 --> 09:34.309
as proof of ownership."

09:34.344 --> 09:36.191
The collar is payment
for the list.

09:36.226 --> 09:37.679
Right, so...

09:37.714 --> 09:39.131
the seller
leaves the tickets

09:39.166 --> 09:40.528
and the lapel pin
in the house.

09:40.563 --> 09:41.645
And we know that the tickets

09:41.680 --> 09:43.767
are for the location
of the hand-off.

09:43.802 --> 09:45.057
But what's this pin?

09:45.092 --> 09:46.990
A way to be identified
by the seller.

09:47.025 --> 09:48.244
That'd be my guess.

09:48.279 --> 09:49.113
Yeah, because
it's not like

09:49.148 --> 09:50.804
these two
professional killers

09:50.860 --> 09:52.246
are gonna send an email
with a photo

09:52.281 --> 09:54.092
and a description
of what they look like.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.827
The tickets tell them
where to be,

09:55.889 --> 09:57.610
and the pin
identifies who they are.

09:57.645 --> 09:59.519
But if they don't know
what the buyers look like...

09:59.570 --> 10:01.168
(Weller)
...we can go undercover.

10:01.203 --> 10:03.156
Pose as the buyers
and take 'em down.

10:03.191 --> 10:04.706
They're expecting
a man and a woman.

10:04.741 --> 10:06.875
A woman who speaks
Bulgarian.

10:08.056 --> 10:09.189
I can do it.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.011
(Zapata)
Wai-wai-wai-wait.

10:10.046 --> 10:11.105
What if we're wrong?

10:11.140 --> 10:12.593
About the pin,
about them knowing

10:12.628 --> 10:13.755
what the buyers
look like.

10:13.790 --> 10:16.185

Born Gord Enver.

22:09.682 --> 22:11.114
Pretty decent programmer.

22:11.149 --> 22:13.509
Knocked around,
made a reasonable living

22:13.544 --> 22:14.890
as a tech mercenary.

22:14.925 --> 22:16.074
But here's the thing.

22:16.109 --> 22:17.654

guys in the world

22:17.689 --> 22:20.186
to realize that the Bitcoin
was gonna be a big deal.

22:20.221 --> 22:21.589
Put everything he had
into it,

22:21.624 --> 22:24.565
and within a couple years,
he was worth $1/2 billion.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.709
Smart guy.

22:25.744 --> 22:26.530
After that,

22:26.565 --> 22:30.387
he changed his name
to Rich Dotcom.

22:30.422 --> 22:31.643
- I take it back.
- Let me guess.

22:31.678 --> 22:33.069
He took all that money
and did a whole bunch

22:33.071 --> 22:34.323
of good in the world
with it?

22:34.358 --> 22:36.030
Oh, opposite, opposite.

22:36.065 --> 22:39.006

trusted names on the Dark Net.

if you have the money,

one more pass on you guys,

someone finally "fffuh."

23:25.092 --> 23:26.439

Was it...

23:26.489 --> 23:28.674
I mean, who actually
slit his throat?

23:30.265 --> 23:31.543

this whole thing

going on right now

23:37.254 --> 23:39.365

you and Stubbles over there?

23:41.006 --> 23:43.017
Are you guys
fully... open,

23:43.052 --> 23:44.406
or is it
a committed thing?

23:44.441 --> 23:46.757
'Cause if it's the latter,
I mean...

turns me on, you know?

23:51.991 --> 23:53.846
It's just sort of part
of this journey, so...

23:53.881 --> 23:55.409

be cool with that?

to that sort of thing?

the only copy.

how hard it was

24:56.621 --> 24:57.859

You paid for access,
not exclusivity.

What are you worried about,
that they're gonna

25:02.241 --> 25:03.790

wanna kill first?

34:05.405 --> 34:07.069
Please, after you.

34:10.944 --> 34:12.434
(glass clinks on table)

34:12.469 --> 34:15.214
Mmm. It's too good
not to share, right?

34:15.313 --> 34:16.733
You guys big
cognac drinkers?

34:16.768 --> 34:17.730
Not really.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.266
Oh, well...

34:20.358 --> 34:22.126
See, the first time
they distill the grapes,

34:22.161 --> 34:25.166
it comes out as this
basically undrinkable wine.

34:25.201 --> 34:26.907
And it's only about seven
or nine percent alcohol.

34:26.942 --> 34:28.092
It's basically
a waste of time.

34:28.128 --> 34:29.849
Should be ashamed
of itself.

34:29.884 --> 34:31.375
But then, they
distill it again,

34:31.409 --> 34:33.788
and it clocks in
at about 70 percent.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.178
And it's just...
crystal clear.

34:37.213 --> 34:40.326
<i>Eau-de-vie,</i>
they call it.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.808
It's French.

34:41.842 --> 34:45.507
But you gotta
distill it twice.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.112
(clicks tongue)

34:47.114 --> 34:49.045
So you guys did the Monaco
job together, right?

34:49.081 --> 34:50.820
- I already told...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.041
I'm talking to Angry
over here.

34:52.076 --> 34:52.937
Don't look at her.

34:52.972 --> 34:54.304
I'm just asking you
a question.

34:54.339 --> 34:58.161
You guys did the Monaco job
together, right?

34:58.196 --> 34:58.994
Yeah.

34:59.029 --> 35:00.526
That's great.

35:00.561 --> 35:02.294
You know,
I hated that guy.

35:02.329 --> 35:04.691
He was such a whiny,
sniveling little...

35:04.726 --> 35:06.775
Who did it, though?
Who actually...

35:06.845 --> 35:07.465
put him down?

35:07.500 --> 35:09.982
<i>Don't...</i> look at her.

35:12.855 --> 35:13.889
She did.

35:13.924 --> 35:16.814
Right...
of course she did.

35:16.849 --> 35:19.011
Right?
Course she did.

35:19.013 --> 35:20.379
(chuckling)
I mean, look at her.

35:20.414 --> 35:22.354
Jeez, you could
put me down, too.

35:22.389 --> 35:23.813
How?

35:24.910 --> 35:26.411
How?

35:26.624 --> 35:28.587
Yeah, that's right.

35:28.589 --> 35:29.788
How?

35:31.341 --> 35:33.181
You are right.

35:33.269 --> 35:35.873
This is too good...

35:35.908 --> 35:37.830
not to share.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.364
Right?

35:39.366 --> 35:40.966
Hyuh! Ohh!

35:41.933 --> 35:43.353
Uhh!

35:43.388 --> 35:44.676
(guns cocking)

35:44.737 --> 35:47.318
Whoo, whoa.
That was fast.

35:47.353 --> 35:48.543
Move away from the desk.

35:48.578 --> 35:50.725
Okay, this just got really
exciting, didn't it?

35:50.760 --> 35:52.201
Give me the other
USB key.

35:52.236 --> 35:53.201
Or what?

35:53.236 --> 35:54.540
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

35:54.575 --> 35:56.275
Okay, Angry,
here we go.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.423
Is it for
you or...

35:58.458 --> 36:00.237
- Give it to me!
- Okay.

36:00.509 --> 36:02.452
All right.

36:02.515 --> 36:03.689
We're gonna walk outside.

36:03.724 --> 36:04.996
You're gonna bring back
the chopper.

36:05.031 --> 36:05.799
And the three of us

36:05.834 --> 36:07.550
are gonna head
back to the city.

36:07.585 --> 36:08.684
We are?

36:08.729 --> 36:10.329
Oh. Okay.

36:10.331 --> 36:12.731
Now...

36:12.804 --> 36:14.683
you step out of line...

36:14.802 --> 36:16.202
I will kill you.

36:16.266 --> 36:17.996
You understand?

36:18.031 --> 36:20.208
Yeah, that seems
pretty straightforward.

36:20.274 --> 36:21.397
Good.

36:21.432 --> 36:23.342
Now... move.

36:28.004 --> 36:30.476
I want you to ask these two
to bring back the chopper.

36:30.511 --> 36:32.233
Gotcha.

36:32.268 --> 36:34.242
Hey, guys!
Crazy night tonight.

36:34.277 --> 36:36.935
Um, can you do me a favor
and kill these two, please?

36:36.970 --> 36:39.362
(guns cocking)

36:41.962 --> 36:44.029
Hey, shouldn't I
be dead already?

36:51.575 --> 36:53.824
Yeah, okay.
You're cops.

36:53.859 --> 36:55.419
Feds, right?
Mm-hmm.

36:55.454 --> 36:56.561
Yeah, if you were mercenaries,
you wouldn't have

36:56.596 --> 36:58.116
bothered to recover
the second list.

36:58.151 --> 37:00.002
I'm right, aren't I?

37:00.037 --> 37:01.212
Yeah.

37:01.247 --> 37:02.713
And, see, cops don't
shoot the suspects

37:02.748 --> 37:04.647
they have in custody...
it's against the law.

37:04.682 --> 37:06.588
So, now that my men
have their guns out,

37:06.623 --> 37:08.619
why don't you
put yours down

37:08.654 --> 37:10.177
and we can call it
a night?

37:10.212 --> 37:12.344
Or you could kill me,
and then they'll kill you.

37:12.379 --> 37:14.178
I'm sure you've done
the math on that.

37:18.243 --> 37:19.051
Or there's that.

37:19.086 --> 37:21.949
(machine gun fire,
party guests screaming)

37:21.984 --> 37:24.182
Come on!
In the pool house!

37:24.217 --> 37:25.850
Come on, run!

37:30.028 --> 37:31.295
(gunfire continues)

37:34.077 --> 37:35.933
Get behind the post!

37:36.011 --> 37:37.701
Stay behind
that pillar!

37:39.453 --> 37:40.754
Agh!

37:43.282 --> 37:44.616
Aaagh!

37:44.900 --> 37:46.166
I'm out!

37:49.815 --> 37:50.637
Right there!

37:50.672 --> 37:52.271
We gotta take out
those guards.

37:52.306 --> 37:54.106
(machine gun fire)

37:54.220 --> 37:55.319
Aaagh!

37:58.053 --> 37:59.454
Aaagh!

38:01.693 --> 38:03.361
Aah!

38:04.566 --> 38:06.189
(Reade on PA)
<i>It's the FBI!</i>

38:06.224 --> 38:07.834
<i>You are surrounded!</i>

38:07.869 --> 38:09.902
<i>Put down
your weapons!</i>

38:14.014 --> 38:15.186
We are the FBI.

38:15.221 --> 38:17.135
You are under arrest.

38:29.663 --> 38:32.168
Nice work today.

38:32.308 --> 38:33.524
Thank you.

38:33.559 --> 38:34.983
Where's the tux?

38:35.160 --> 38:37.361
I couldn't wait
to get out of that thing.

38:37.628 --> 38:39.520
So how 'bout
that drink?

38:39.555 --> 38:41.265
I can't.

38:41.362 --> 38:44.971
We have a housewarming
thing tonight, for Jane.

38:45.006 --> 38:46.186
Okay.

38:55.584 --> 38:57.130
Thanks for getting
that list back.

38:57.165 --> 38:59.083
Oh, glad I could help.

39:00.352 --> 39:02.813
He's got a few walls
that may never come down...

39:02.848 --> 39:04.355
and is maybe the most
introverted person

39:04.390 --> 39:06.391
I've ever met,
but aside from that,

39:06.426 --> 39:08.292
you won't find
a better man.

39:14.485 --> 39:18.034
We should probably
take those rings off.
