00:02.480 --> 00:03.720
I want a divorce.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.200
-Jonna!
-Let go!

00:22.800 --> 00:28.600
If Konrad comes back, or if you hear
anything else, call me, any time.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.280
<i>-Thank you for your help.</i>
<i>-Bye!</i>

00:33.400 --> 00:38.360
-What was the police doing here?
-They're looking for Konrad.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.800
I showed them where
I heard the gunshot.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.480
An old friend of mine lives
in Helsinki.

00:56.560 --> 01:01.960
If you sell him counterfeit money,
he'll pay you 30-35% of its value.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.760
I want 10% to make the deal.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.320
This is good stuff.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.880
This won't work, Wille.
I can't do this.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.400
-Can't do what?
-You and me.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.680
I can't. I just can't right now.

01:28.960 --> 01:33.480
The suppliers called.
They have lost their patience.

01:33.560 --> 01:37.120
-Everything has been taken care of.
-How?

01:37.200 --> 01:40.280
Everything has been paid for.

01:42.120 --> 01:46.720
The credits, food, booze
and the renovation.

01:49.200 --> 01:55.080
-So everything's been taken care of?
-Yes, everything.

01:55.160 --> 01:58.240
Hey! I've got vests for you.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.080
THICKER THAN WATER

04:09.440 --> 04:12.320
Do you mind doing it?

04:14.080 --> 04:17.080
-Sure.
-Thanks.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.560
-How did it go?
-We... found him by the water.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.280
-How did it happen? Did he drown?
-I don't know.

05:01.360 --> 05:05.000
Probably.
The ice can be treacherous out here.

05:05.680 --> 05:11.360
Konrad of all people should know
the ice. He's always out ice fishing.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.400
Maybe he was drunk.

05:19.640 --> 05:26.200
I'm sorry, I don't know much about
him except that he likes to drink.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.240
-Good morning.
-Good night!

05:48.000 --> 05:51.800
He must have been crawling on the ice
with that much alcohol in his blood.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.960
He was shot from a very close
distance, at an angle from below.

05:56.040 --> 06:01.160
He most likely tripped. The gun
went off and he fell in the water.

06:05.560 --> 06:10.920
-What's this?
-It was caught on his glove.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.640
-Is it from a coat?
-Maybe, but not his.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.840
-See you later.
-Bye.

06:55.960 --> 07:01.040
-Are those popular?
-It seems that way.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.360
How would you describe Konrad?

07:09.280 --> 07:11.200
Difficult.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.720
He didn't like people.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.800
He wasn't always like that.
His brother disappeared.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.360
One day, Mauritz was just gone.

07:27.800 --> 07:32.160
-He was pronounced dead.
-Yes, after many years.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.040
Thoughts about why
probably broke Konrad.

07:38.280 --> 07:43.600
-Could he have been suicidal?
-I don't know. Maybe.

07:47.320 --> 07:53.720
One more thing...
What is Jonna doing in Åland?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.040
I've been wondering
about that myself.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.200
She doesn't seem to be
in the hospitality business.

07:59.280 --> 08:04.240
-Can you tell?
-It's just a feeling.

08:04.320 --> 08:09.440
She is an actress. A really good one.
She is great at playing headwaiter.

08:11.560 --> 08:17.680
Thanks. Let me know
if you think of something.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.160
Hi.

09:54.520 --> 09:59.040
-This is my last night here.
-Okay.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.560
So...

10:03.040 --> 10:07.240
-What do I do with the key?
-You leave it in the reception.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.640
I can see to it that you get
the same room next time.

10:10.720 --> 10:15.680
I've taken another job.
But I've sorted out a replacement.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.200
-So it's all the same.
-Right.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.400
-Hey.
-Hi.

10:33.480 --> 10:37.160
-Do you want some?
-Yes, please.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.480
Liv wants a divorce.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.240
What?

10:57.320 --> 11:02.280
I'm surprised it lasted this long
considering how it started.

11:04.800 --> 11:11.720
I see now you'll never be able to
forgive me for writing that letter.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.120
I ruined it for the two of you.

11:20.480 --> 11:25.680
-I thought I could make her happy.
-You have made her happy.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.800
You have Cecilia.

11:33.320 --> 11:37.120
I'm grateful you came home.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.600
I wouldn't have survived
this winter without you.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.640
So...

11:50.280 --> 11:56.040
-Now what?
-Why not keep running the inn?

11:58.960 --> 12:03.600
-Not on my own. It's too much work.
-With me.

12:03.680 --> 12:07.240
-What?
-Me and you. Together.

12:07.320 --> 12:12.520
-We'll take over.
-Liv has a share in the inn.

12:12.600 --> 12:15.040
-I can't afford to buy her out.
-I can do it.

12:15.120 --> 12:19.400
When things are up and running we'll
take out a loan and buy out Jonna.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.080
Then it's yours and mine.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.600
How about it?

12:35.680 --> 12:37.440
Dad?

13:05.880 --> 13:10.440
MAN FOUND DROWNED

13:34.560 --> 13:36.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:36.080 --> 13:40.760
-I'm going to pick up Cecilia.
-Already?

13:40.840 --> 13:44.960
Maybe not right now, but soon.
I don't want to be late.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.920
There's might be some traffic.

13:48.840 --> 13:54.280
I'm sorry about Konrad.
Was it hard finding the body?

13:54.360 --> 13:58.480
Yes... I never would have thought.

14:00.680 --> 14:06.240
I have a question. Will you stay at
the inn while Cecilia is here?

14:06.320 --> 14:10.880
-Yes, why?
-She doesn't know.

14:10.960 --> 14:16.080
About the divorce.
You haven't told her, have you?

14:16.160 --> 14:19.400
No, it's not something
you should take over the phone.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.920
-But we have to tell her, of course.
-There's no hurry, right?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.840
Do you want to put on an act?
No thanks.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.960
I have to tell her both about
Konrad's death and our divorce.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.120
I don't think she will take
his death that hard.

14:35.200 --> 14:41.680
That may be, but we could at least
give her a nice Christmas.

14:41.760 --> 14:46.280
A family Christmas in
the house she grew up in.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.640
I think she needs it.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.560
Fine, I'll move back.
But only for Christmas.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.720
-Then we tell her.
-Of course.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.960
How did you get here?

15:13.480 --> 15:17.680
-Who shot you, Andrus?
-Kim? What does it say?

15:19.440 --> 15:22.560
It says that you've been lying to me.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.800
There was a fire on a boat and
they found a man, dead.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.960
-And it wasn't an accident.
-I don't know nothing about this.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.400
But the boat was from Estonia,
is that a coincidence?

15:38.560 --> 15:40.600
You're on your own now.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.080
Wait. Please.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.960
There's this guy, Misha.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.400
I owed him some money and he
wanted me to help him with a job.

16:02.800 --> 16:08.640
-Cash smuggling. I had no choice.
-Did you kill him?

16:09.080 --> 16:13.560
No. I don't know what happened
during the exchange.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.120
Maybe Misha tried to fool him or...
I don't know.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.160
They were speaking in Swedish
so I couldn't understand.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.400
All of a sudden they start shooting
at us so I jumped into the water.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.680
I thought Misha did too.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.520
I didn't know he was dead.

16:39.320 --> 16:42.000
Really sorry I lied to you.

16:42.080 --> 16:46.960
I just thought that you'd be
better off not knowing.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.560
I gotta get outta here, Kim.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.080
I can't stay here.
I can't hide forever.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.920
I know.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.680
-Hi.
-I've missed you so much.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.800
It's been so empty here without you.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.560
-Hi!
-Hi!

17:50.600 --> 17:52.240
How was your trip?

17:52.320 --> 17:56.520
You make it sound like I had to sail
around to the world to get here.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.000
-I know. Are you hungry?
-Starving.

18:00.080 --> 18:05.640
-You've put on weight.
-That's no way to talk to your mum.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.720
Hi!

18:08.120 --> 18:11.160
-Have you taken my old job?
-Yes, and the tips too.

18:11.240 --> 18:15.200
-People around here don't tip.
-Sure they do.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.720
Come.

18:23.200 --> 18:29.240
-I thought we'd have dinner together.
-Thank you.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.480
Can I come in?

19:02.640 --> 19:09.200
I just talked to Oskar.
He told me about the divorce.

19:11.040 --> 19:16.720
-It's for the best, but it hurts.
-I understand.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
Are you pregnant?

19:26.440 --> 19:30.720
-I don't know what to do.
-Does Oskar know?

19:30.800 --> 19:32.400
No.

19:35.480 --> 19:39.360
A baby might not be able
to save a marriage,

19:39.440 --> 19:42.720
but since you are pregnant,
shouldn't you...

19:42.800 --> 19:43.760
at least try?

19:45.760 --> 19:50.320
-I think it's too late.
-It's not.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.520
He loves you. I know he does.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.560
I'd like to be alone for a while.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.360
Of course.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.640
The notes, the boat, the bodies...
It's all connected somehow.

20:24.720 --> 20:29.720
We can write off Wille Ek.
CKP didn't have anything on him.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.800
When do we get the
ballistics analysis?

20:31.880 --> 20:36.360
Come on, let's call it a day.

20:42.600 --> 20:47.160
-Hello. Is this a bad time?
-I was just about to go home.

20:47.240 --> 20:52.120
-Can it wait until tomorrow?
-I have some counterfeit notes.

20:53.280 --> 20:57.040
You'll have to come back tomorrow.
How much is it?

20:57.120 --> 20:59.160
This much.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.640
-Are all of them counterfeit?
-Want to know where I got them?

21:09.160 --> 21:11.320
Take a seat.

21:47.880 --> 21:53.000
-Don't you know how to knock?
-Cecilia is out there.

21:53.080 --> 21:57.760
I shouldn't have to knock
on my own bedroom door.

21:57.840 --> 22:01.000
This isn't working.
We can't live like this.

22:01.080 --> 22:05.160
Come on... It's not like
I haven't seen you change before.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.880
Things are different now.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.520
I can't take this anymore.
We have to tell Cecilia.

22:12.600 --> 22:17.680
We agreed to give her this Christmas.
Don't be so selfish.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.080
This clearly isn't for her sake...

22:23.080 --> 22:26.960
Beatrice wants us
to come sign the divorce papers.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.720
Have you talked to Beatrice
about the divorce?

22:30.800 --> 22:34.480
You'll have to go there on your own.
I've already signed it.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.520
Damn it!

22:49.840 --> 22:52.640
-What was that all about?
-What?

22:52.720 --> 22:57.160
It was just your mum and I...
discussing things.

22:57.240 --> 23:01.840
-What things?
-It was nothing important.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.600
I'm not your little girl anymore.
You can talk to me.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.960
Don't worry, Cecilia.
There's nothing to talk about.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.800
You will always be
Daddy's little girl!

23:23.200 --> 23:24.280
-Hello.
-Hi.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.520
-I'd like to exchange this to euros.
-Yes.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.720
-Would you like to deposit it?
-No thanks.

23:47.240 --> 23:51.200
-Could I have a word with you?
-Why?

23:51.280 --> 23:54.160
-It's about a report.
-What kind of report?

23:54.880 --> 24:01.440
-Let's talk outside.
-Okay. I'm just...

24:12.160 --> 24:14.520
There you go. Thank you.

24:15.560 --> 24:19.040
-Did you make sure they were real?
-Yes.

24:27.240 --> 24:31.960
Do you often get paid in dollars?
Or perhaps that wasn't for a job.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.240
Not really, but it happens.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.840
Do you recognise this?

24:44.320 --> 24:46.480
If I tell you it's mine,
can I keep it?

24:50.160 --> 24:52.640
They all look the same.

24:52.720 --> 24:56.720
It doesn't just look the same,
it is identical to this one.

24:56.800 --> 25:01.960
-Look, the serial numbers match.
-What's your point?

25:02.040 --> 25:05.840
Did you know it was counterfeit
when you gave it to Mikael Rosén?

25:06.760 --> 25:10.680
So that's what this is about.
What did he say?

25:10.760 --> 25:15.480
-I'd like to hear your version.
-I did a job for him.

25:15.560 --> 25:20.680
He wanted as much as possible
for as little pay as possible

25:20.760 --> 25:25.880
-so I packed up and left.
-Then what happened?

25:25.960 --> 25:30.880
He blacklisted me and threatened
to report me for breach of contract.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.160
-Is that what he reported me for?
-No.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.000
He reported you for paying him
in counterfeit money.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.320
I haven't given him any money.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.680
If he wants money, he'll have to
sue me, you can tell him that.

25:44.560 --> 25:49.480
Is there anyone who can say where
you were on the 17th and 18th?

25:49.560 --> 25:53.360
You may have heard about
Konrad Waldemar's death.

25:53.960 --> 26:00.800
He had a large amount of counterfeit
notes. The same notes you gave Rosén.

26:01.640 --> 26:06.840
Were you afraid Konrad would reveal
where the money came from?

26:07.640 --> 26:12.280
Why would I give money
to that old man?

26:12.360 --> 26:17.040
I did the same on the 17th and 18th
as I've been doing every day lately.

26:17.120 --> 26:22.640
I got up, worked and went to bed.
You can ask my colleague.

26:22.720 --> 26:26.200
We do everything together
at the moment.

26:26.280 --> 26:32.600
Good. So when I examine these notes,
I won't find your fingerprints.

26:32.680 --> 26:36.160
Of course you will. On that one.

26:53.400 --> 26:57.800
-Can I sit down for a while?
-Yes, of course.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.840
I didn't think people
wrote letters anymore.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.560
I prefer writing by hand.
I think better.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.760
What are you writing?

27:06.560 --> 27:10.800
-A love letter?
-What makes you say that?

27:10.880 --> 27:15.120
-It was just something your dad said.
-Did he write you love letters?

27:15.880 --> 27:20.840
No... When would he have done that?
We were never apart.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.240
Not until now.

27:26.440 --> 27:30.240
-Things aren't so good between you.
-No.

27:31.880 --> 27:37.640
-We're getting divorced.
-Are you?

27:39.520 --> 27:42.280
-When did you decide that?
-A while ago.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.040
I've been staying at the inn
for a while.

27:47.200 --> 27:53.600
-Why didn't you tell me?
-We should have. I'm sorry.

27:55.120 --> 28:01.000
What will happen now? Where
will you live? What about the inn?

28:03.920 --> 28:06.040
I don't know.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.760
-Hello.
-Hi.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.720
Do you know where the siblings are?

28:29.800 --> 28:34.800
Oskar should be in the office.
Lasse and Jonna are in the kitchen.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.560
Thanks again for dinner.

28:50.920 --> 28:54.360
-How was Helsinki?
-It was all right.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.080
I bought some things for
the renovation.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.440
With Wille Ek?

29:02.920 --> 29:03.760
That's right.

29:06.920 --> 29:11.280
I know a fair bit about Wille.
You should be careful.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.360
-I'll keep that in mind.
-How do you pay him?

29:22.160 --> 29:28.800
Right... I gave him some cash in hand
in advance. I know I shouldn't have.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.080
In what currency?

29:33.360 --> 29:38.760
Lasse, did you give Konrad any money
before he disappeared?

29:38.840 --> 29:42.640
Of course not.
Is this an interrogation?

29:42.720 --> 29:44.200
Take me to the station if it is.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.560
Maybe I should.

29:46.920 --> 29:50.240
-Where is Oskar?
-How the hell should I know?

29:57.400 --> 30:03.400
It's a shame what happened.
How well did you know each other?

30:03.480 --> 30:10.080
-How well do you know your uncle?
-I don't have one.

30:10.160 --> 30:17.120
Just because we were related that
doesn't mean we spent time together.

30:17.200 --> 30:21.320
-Why not?
-I'm not actually sure.

30:21.400 --> 30:25.280
It was just the way it was.

30:25.360 --> 30:30.400
Especially when Mum became a widow.

30:30.480 --> 30:34.000
I don't think they liked each other.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.280
He minded his business
and we minded ours.

30:38.520 --> 30:42.800
Why was he so angry
that night he came here?

30:43.880 --> 30:49.360
Konrad didn't need a reason to be
angry. It was just how he was.

30:49.440 --> 30:52.840
Do you know where Konrad
could have gotten 50,000 euro?

30:52.920 --> 30:55.360
Fifty...? No.

30:55.440 --> 30:59.880
He tried to buy a boat for
that amount. In cash.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.320
Wow...

31:02.400 --> 31:03.960
50,000 euro...

31:04.040 --> 31:08.240
He provided for himself
by hunting and fishing.

31:08.320 --> 31:11.840
Though I wouldn't be surprised
if he was hiding a fortune.

31:11.920 --> 31:15.040
He would never tell us about it.

31:15.120 --> 31:19.480
Stingy. Very stingy.

31:19.560 --> 31:24.720
-It turned out to be counterfeit.
-Oh...

31:24.800 --> 31:28.360
Could he have been
mixed up in something?

31:28.440 --> 31:30.880
Something criminal?

31:30.960 --> 31:33.800
No, not Konrad.

31:33.880 --> 31:40.280
Poaching, maybe. Or home distilling.

31:40.360 --> 31:47.040
-Which he was really good at.
-Well, that won't get you shot.

31:48.560 --> 31:53.320
Did I not mention
Konrad had a gunshot wound?

31:53.400 --> 31:57.640
You may have seen it yourself.
On the body.

31:57.720 --> 32:02.920
-I have some things I need to do.
-I won't take up more of your time.

32:03.000 --> 32:07.920
Actually, I came to get your weapons.
We're taking the rifles in the area.

32:08.440 --> 32:12.920
-You have some.
-That's right. They're locked up.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.280
I'm sure, but we're pleading
for the public to cooperate

32:17.360 --> 32:21.240
to narrow down the list of suspects.

32:21.320 --> 32:25.480
You're not obligated to hand them in.
Not yet.

32:29.760 --> 32:35.720
You don't have to plead. Of course
I'll cooperate with the police.

32:41.680 --> 32:47.600
By the way, did you see Konrad after
the night he caused trouble here?

32:47.680 --> 32:50.480
No, I don't think so.

32:54.120 --> 32:59.240
It seems to be the last time
anyone saw him. It's unfortunate.

32:59.320 --> 33:03.120
-What do you mean?
-That you parted on bad terms.

33:05.520 --> 33:08.760
-Right.
-Thanks for your help.

33:15.880 --> 33:18.720
-How's it going?
-Hi.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.520
Good.

33:22.720 --> 33:25.000
My condolences.

33:26.520 --> 33:29.360
Yes, thanks.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.600
-It's very sad.
-You're the only one who says that.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.080
That it's sad.

33:38.280 --> 33:44.120
He was difficult.
But it was just a facade.

33:45.120 --> 33:49.440
-What was behind the facade?
-A very lonely man.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.400
What do you think happened?

33:55.720 --> 33:59.480
I hope he was drunk and fell
through the ice.

33:59.560 --> 34:02.640
The alternative is far too tragic.

34:02.720 --> 34:07.520
-What alternative?
-That he killed himself.

34:10.640 --> 34:15.400
-Did you found a bullet in him?
-Yes, we did.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.360
See you.

34:27.240 --> 34:32.640
-How did it go? What did you say?
-That I thought it was suicide. You?

34:32.720 --> 34:36.760
She can fire those guns
all she wants.

34:36.840 --> 34:41.280
As long as we say nothing and stick
together they can't do anything.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.840
Light the candles.

34:46.640 --> 34:49.400
-Did you put this up?
-Yes.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.760
-It's cute.
-Thanks.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.840
You can do the decorations
for New Year's Eve.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.600
I might not still be here.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.240
Wille leaves today.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.600
Don't you want to talk to him?

35:08.680 --> 35:12.680
-I think it's good that Wille leaves.
-All right.

35:12.760 --> 35:15.960
I just don't want you
to regret it later.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.160
-Is it time to leave?
-Yes.

35:31.680 --> 35:36.040
The new guy will be here after New
Year's. There won't be any problem.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.720
It can't get any worse.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.080
-Are you sure you don't want to stay?
-Yes.

35:46.920 --> 35:50.640
Have you talked to her?

35:52.760 --> 35:54.080
It's no use.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.880
-Take care.
-You too.

36:03.120 --> 36:08.920
One more thing. The policewoman.
She asked me about counterfeit money.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.760
-Mikael Rosén reported me.
-Rosén?

36:14.840 --> 36:17.960
-Why?
-He's the one I was in debt to.

36:18.040 --> 36:22.600
-Why the hell didn't you tell me?
-The police can't do anything.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.760
-I never touched the notes.
-No, but I did.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.960
Do they have your prints?

36:29.040 --> 36:34.280
No, but Rosén must understand
that the money came from me.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.040
Then why didn't he report you?

36:40.040 --> 36:43.120
As long as we keep our mouths shut,
they can't prove anything.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.560
I have to...

37:22.640 --> 37:24.640
Wille!

37:25.640 --> 37:27.600
Wille!

37:45.360 --> 37:47.880
-What the hell?
-Were you just going leave?

37:47.960 --> 37:50.320
-I could have hit you!
-Were you?

37:50.400 --> 37:52.000
Were you leaving without a word?

37:52.080 --> 37:54.560
Without a word?
You're the one who...

37:56.800 --> 38:02.040
What do you want me to say?
You haven't asked me to stay.

38:02.120 --> 38:06.000
So you were just going to give up?
Good to know.

38:06.080 --> 38:09.680
-What are you doing?
-Go.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.960
-Wait!
-Go!

38:15.400 --> 38:18.760
-Let go off me! Let go!
-I love you.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.520
I'm terrible at this stuff.

38:32.960 --> 38:39.560
-Have you never loved anyone before?
-I've never said so.

38:40.240 --> 38:42.760
Then show me instead.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.680
Have you moved in here now?

39:52.200 --> 39:54.200
Oskar told me.

39:56.840 --> 39:59.640
It's been over for a long time.
Might as well face it.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.600
-Are you okay?
-No.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.400
I'd rather have something
else to think about.

40:13.400 --> 40:17.760
The love letter Oskar tore up,
what did it say?

40:22.560 --> 40:26.640
-I'm taking that to my grave.
-How come?

40:26.720 --> 40:28.960
It was twenty years ago.

40:29.040 --> 40:35.080
I was young, naive... and silly.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.640
-Why silly?
-Young people don't know any better.

40:39.720 --> 40:42.880
Maybe you should try not to
when you're older as well.

40:44.960 --> 40:51.560
It's the only love letter anyone has
written me, and I haven't read it.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.920
It's the only love letter
I've written.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.960
If that's true,
don't you remember it?

40:58.040 --> 41:00.520
-Give it a rest.
-How did it start?

41:00.600 --> 41:02.920
-Stop it.
-One tiny sentence.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.520
-Never.
-"Dear Liv,

41:04.600 --> 41:09.160
I can't live without you."

41:12.760 --> 41:14.840
I remember all of it.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.200
I'm pregnant.

41:27.440 --> 41:30.440
-Doesn't look that good.
-It'll be fine.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.520
See? No fever.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.320
I get my paycheck at the
end of the month.

41:39.400 --> 41:40.840
Paycheck?

41:40.920 --> 41:43.640
-Yeah?
-You don't have any money?

41:43.720 --> 41:44.840
I have to earn it first.

41:46.200 --> 41:49.360
I thought your family has
a lodging house?

41:49.440 --> 41:55.080
Yeah, but I only work there. It's my
first job, actually.

41:55.160 --> 41:58.480
I was trying to get an advance, but
it wasn't possible, so.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.160
You will get it a few days after
Christmas. Is that okay?

42:05.200 --> 42:07.000
-What?
-It's your first paycheck,

42:07.080 --> 42:10.120
and you're gonna give it to me?

42:11.360 --> 42:16.960
Yeah, you need it.
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.920
-Kim?
-Yeah?

42:33.200 --> 42:36.200
-Can I use your phone?
-Of course.

42:50.280 --> 42:51.840
DAD

43:04.600 --> 43:06.560
Hello?

43:08.240 --> 43:10.520
Kim?

43:10.600 --> 43:12.760
Are you there, Kim?

43:14.560 --> 43:17.560
