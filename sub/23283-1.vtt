00:11.083 --> 00:13.083
- It's hard to believe that

00:11.083 --> 00:13.083
just a few months ago

00:13.125 --> 00:15.875
we were petrified about

00:13.125 --> 00:15.875
starting a new school.

00:15.917 --> 00:17.291
- And now look at us.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.500
We get to hang out

00:17.333 --> 00:18.500
with friends

00:18.542 --> 00:20.041
and dig in the dirt

00:18.542 --> 00:20.041
for a grade.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.041
- Wait, there's grades in here?

00:22.083 --> 00:23.625
I hope I find

00:22.083 --> 00:23.625
an A.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.750
No, I'm kidding.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.750
I know there's no A's in here.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.375
I'll settle for a B.

00:28.417 --> 00:31.041
- Who knew school could feel so

00:28.417 --> 00:31.041
un-school-ish?

00:31.083 --> 00:32.583
- It really did work out great.

00:32.625 --> 00:34.125
I mean, it

00:32.625 --> 00:34.125
took us three months,

00:34.166 --> 00:36.041
but we finally

00:34.166 --> 00:36.041
made a bunch of new friends

00:36.083 --> 00:37.417
and everybody's happy.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.667
- Sups haps.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.667
I dig it here.

00:39.709 --> 00:41.166
[bell rings]

00:41.208 --> 00:42.166
- School's over already?

00:42.208 --> 00:43.959
all: Aww.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.417
- Don't worry. We get to come

00:44.000 --> 00:46.417
back to school tomorrow.

00:46.458 --> 00:47.709
all: Yay!

00:47.750 --> 00:51.375
- But it's our turn

00:47.750 --> 00:51.375
to clean up.

00:51.417 --> 00:52.667
all: Lucky.

00:52.709 --> 00:54.291
- All right, see you guys

00:52.709 --> 00:54.291
tomorrow.

00:54.333 --> 00:55.625
all: Bye.

00:55.667 --> 00:58.125
Hey, my shovel's

00:55.667 --> 00:58.125
stuck on a root.

00:58.166 --> 00:59.458
Could you give me a hand?

00:59.500 --> 01:01.542
- Do it yourself!

01:01.583 --> 01:04.959
Is what I would have

01:01.583 --> 01:04.959
said at our old school.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.875
But now, come on, guys.

01:06.917 --> 01:09.041
Let's help Dickitydoo.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.333
- Look at us.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.542
The Harper Quads working

01:10.375 --> 01:12.542
together.

01:12.583 --> 01:14.542
Has life ever been this good?

01:14.583 --> 01:16.250
[together] Nope.

01:16.291 --> 01:17.458
[creaking]

01:20.792 --> 01:22.875
- It wasn't a root,

01:20.792 --> 01:22.875
it's a pipe!

01:22.917 --> 01:25.625
- We struck oil!

01:22.917 --> 01:25.625
We're gonna be rich!

01:25.667 --> 01:27.208
- No! Dickitydont!

01:27.250 --> 01:29.709
- That's not oil. That's sewage!

01:29.750 --> 01:31.875
- What?

01:29.750 --> 01:31.875
- It's Dickitydoody!

01:31.917 --> 01:33.375
all: Gross!

01:33.417 --> 01:35.291
- Quick! We need to plug

01:33.417 --> 01:35.291
the hole!

01:35.333 --> 01:37.875
- Your gloves! Everybody throw

01:35.333 --> 01:37.875
your gloves in there!

01:45.041 --> 01:47.083
- [exhales]

01:47.125 --> 01:48.917
There.

01:48.959 --> 01:50.500
That should hold it.

01:50.542 --> 01:53.041
- Great. Let's just fill this

01:50.542 --> 01:53.041
with dirt, and no one

01:53.083 --> 01:55.542
will ever know that something

01:53.083 --> 01:55.542
terrible happened here.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.792

their school?

03:33.625 --> 03:35.208
[together] We did.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.542

- Or who--

03:37.583 --> 03:39.542
- What do you mean?

03:39.583 --> 03:41.125
There's no who.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.125
- Yeah, it's definitely a what.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.625
and the what and the werd,

04:03.959 --> 04:05.750
Eh?

04:03.959 --> 04:05.750
- And all new students!

04:05.792 --> 04:08.542
It took us three months to

04:05.792 --> 04:08.542
finally be comfortable at the

04:05.792 --> 04:08.542
old school.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.625

04:19.667 --> 04:21.834
Those smiles are infectious.

- It looks like everyone is

04:24.917 --> 04:27.542
already friends at this place.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.583
- There's obvs no room for us.

There's room

04:32.792 --> 04:34.375

04:36.458 --> 04:39.000
There's obvs no room for us!

04:39.041 --> 04:41.083
- Okay, let's focus

04:39.041 --> 04:41.083
on the positive,

04:41.125 --> 04:44.208
like this

04:41.125 --> 04:44.208
study buddy program.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.542
- That started three months ago.

04:46.583 --> 04:48.875
Which means everybody's

04:46.583 --> 04:48.875
study-buddied up.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.959
- Relax.

04:48.917 --> 04:50.959
I'll be your spuddy buddy.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.583
- It's study buddy.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.792
- Oh yeah?

04:53.834 --> 04:55.917
Then why do I have this potato?

04:55.959 --> 04:58.250
- I don't know.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.875
Hey, Dicky, getting a jump on

04:58.291 --> 05:00.875
your spuddying, huh?

05:00.917 --> 05:02.792
- What is happening?

05:02.834 --> 05:04.291
- What's happening is that

05:02.834 --> 05:04.291
you're nervous

05:04.333 --> 05:05.792
about going to a new school.

05:05.834 --> 05:07.333
But you made friends

05:05.834 --> 05:07.333
at Rothschild Prep,

05:07.375 --> 05:09.125
and I'm sure you'll

05:07.375 --> 05:09.125
make friends here too.

05:09.166 --> 05:11.583
- Yeah, you just go up to

05:09.166 --> 05:11.583
somebody and say something cool,

05:11.625 --> 05:14.375
like, uh, "What's good,

05:11.625 --> 05:14.375
big boy?"

05:14.417 --> 05:16.291
- Yeah, or, "Looking fly, girl."

05:16.333 --> 05:19.875
- Haha, yeah?

05:16.333 --> 05:19.875
See, you guys get it.

05:19.917 --> 05:22.166
- Yeah.

05:19.917 --> 05:22.166
- We get it.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.333
- Do you guys get it?

05:22.208 --> 05:24.333
[together] No.

05:24.375 --> 05:25.959
- But they're right.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.250
I mean, if we were able

05:26.000 --> 05:28.250
to fit in once,

05:28.291 --> 05:30.208
we should be able

05:28.291 --> 05:30.208
to do it again.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.041
We just need to do

05:30.250 --> 05:32.041
the same thing

05:32.083 --> 05:33.875
on the first day

05:32.083 --> 05:33.875
of our new school

05:33.917 --> 05:35.709
as we did at our

05:33.917 --> 05:35.709
last school.

05:35.750 --> 05:38.375
- Yes. We entered through those

05:35.750 --> 05:38.375
now-sunken doors together...

05:38.417 --> 05:39.875
- Together.

05:38.417 --> 05:39.875
- Full of confidence.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.417
- Confidence!

05:41.458 --> 05:42.875
- Laughing and acting like

05:41.458 --> 05:42.875
we belonged there.

05:42.917 --> 05:44.625
- There!

05:44.667 --> 05:48.000
- We just need to make a good

05:44.667 --> 05:48.000
first impression, again.

05:48.041 --> 05:49.291
- I guess that makes sense.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.000
- Of course it makes sense.

05:51.041 --> 05:53.875
Here, we'll meet outside

05:51.041 --> 05:53.875
the new school at 8:12,

05:56.458 --> 05:58.792
- I'm game.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.792
- I'm in.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.667
- Let's do it.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.667
- Hey, there's ice cream.

06:00.709 --> 06:02.000
- Oh, Sundae.

06:02.041 --> 06:03.375
- All right, then we'll

06:02.041 --> 06:03.375
see you guys tomorrow.

06:03.417 --> 06:04.750
- All right, we'll see ya.

06:03.417 --> 06:04.750
- See ya.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.625
[overlapping chatter]

06:06.667 --> 06:08.417
- At least they left here

06:06.667 --> 06:08.417
feeling hopeful

06:08.458 --> 06:09.667
about the new school

06:09.709 --> 06:11.000
and not thinking about who sunk

06:09.709 --> 06:11.000
the old school.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.667
- I almost forgot.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.667

12:51.792 --> 12:55.250

12:51.792 --> 12:55.250
[together] Oooooh.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.375
- And "The Case of the

12:55.291 --> 12:57.375
Half-Eaten Party Sub."

12:57.417 --> 13:00.500
- Also the janitor.

12:57.417 --> 13:00.500
[together] Aaaahh.

13:00.542 --> 13:02.375
- So, what's our case gonna be?

13:02.417 --> 13:05.834
- "The Case of Who Sunk

13:02.417 --> 13:05.834
Rothschild Prep."

13:07.750 --> 13:09.542
- Starting tomorrow,

13:09.583 --> 13:11.542
we roll up our sleeves and start

13:09.583 --> 13:11.542
digging for facts.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.083
We will not rest until the

13:11.583 --> 13:14.083
sinkers are brought to justice.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.375
Never forget.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.375
Rothschild forever!

13:16.417 --> 13:18.166
all: Yeah!

13:21.166 --> 13:23.208
- I think we're all thinking

13:21.166 --> 13:23.208
the same thing here, right?

13:23.250 --> 13:26.417
- How annoying Mae is with that

13:23.250 --> 13:26.417
"Never forget.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.000
Rothschild

13:26.458 --> 13:28.000
Forever!"?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.834
- How obvious it is that Sadie

13:28.041 --> 13:29.834
and Kipper love each other

13:29.875 --> 13:31.709
but lack the courage

13:29.875 --> 13:31.709
to admit it?

13:31.750 --> 13:33.333
- How I shouldn't have eaten

13:31.750 --> 13:33.333
that string cheese

13:33.375 --> 13:35.125
I found on the ground yesterday?

13:35.166 --> 13:36.709
- No.

13:36.750 --> 13:37.959
Well, yes.

13:36.750 --> 13:37.959
All three of those.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.500
But more importantly,

13:39.542 --> 13:41.291
if we don't

13:39.542 --> 13:41.291
throw them off our trail,

13:41.333 --> 13:42.875
we're going down faster than

13:41.333 --> 13:42.875
that school we sank.

13:42.917 --> 13:45.834
- My nervous breath is back.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.333
Here we go again.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.333

14:02.291 --> 14:03.750
Everybody stick to the plan.

14:03.792 --> 14:06.750
Hey guys!

14:03.792 --> 14:06.750
- Wow. You're a busy bunch.

14:06.792 --> 14:08.542
- What is all this?

14:08.583 --> 14:11.000
- Oh, we just wanted to get

14:08.583 --> 14:11.000
a jump on the case.

14:11.041 --> 14:13.417
- We started by brainstorming

14:11.041 --> 14:13.417
for three hours

14:13.458 --> 14:15.000
and came up with the one

14:13.458 --> 14:15.000
question

14:15.041 --> 14:16.542
that no one else would

14:15.041 --> 14:16.542
think to ask:

14:16.583 --> 14:18.500
"Who did it?"

14:18.542 --> 14:20.417
- These guys don't mess around.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.709
- Was it...

14:22.750 --> 14:24.875
Mr. Platakus,

14:22.750 --> 14:24.875
the shop teacher?

14:24.917 --> 14:26.917
- [gasps] Platakus did it?

14:26.959 --> 14:28.542
- No.

14:28.583 --> 14:31.583
But we did find out it's

14:28.583 --> 14:31.583
pronounced "Pla-two-cuss."

14:31.625 --> 14:34.375
- Why does that matter?

14:34.417 --> 14:37.166
- It doesn't. Just FYI.

14:37.208 --> 14:40.458
- So we moved on to our next

14:37.208 --> 14:40.458
suspect...

14:40.500 --> 14:43.375
Mr. Faubus, the bus driver!

14:43.417 --> 14:45.500
- He did it?

14:45.542 --> 14:48.333
- No. But we did find out it's

14:45.542 --> 14:48.333
actually Mrs. Faubus.

14:48.375 --> 14:50.917
- To be fair, the mustache

14:48.375 --> 14:50.917
kinda threw us.

14:50.959 --> 14:53.083
- And since she didn't do it,

14:53.125 --> 14:55.583
we moved on to our next,

14:53.125 --> 14:55.583
next suspect...

14:55.625 --> 14:57.542
- We don't care who didn't

14:55.625 --> 14:57.542
do it.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.417
Can we just get to what's behind

14:57.583 --> 14:59.417
the big question mark?

14:59.458 --> 15:02.041
- Fine.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.834
- Now what's behind that

15:02.083 --> 15:03.834
question mark?

15:05.250 --> 15:07.208
- How many question marks

15:05.250 --> 15:07.208
are there?

15:07.250 --> 15:10.834
- I'll ask the questions

15:07.250 --> 15:10.834
around here.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.166
How many question marks

15:10.875 --> 15:12.166
are there?

15:12.208 --> 15:15.000
- I'll ask the questions

15:12.208 --> 15:15.000
around here.

15:15.041 --> 15:16.834
How many question marks

15:15.041 --> 15:16.834
are there?

15:16.875 --> 15:20.542
- I will ask the questions

15:16.875 --> 15:20.542
around here.

15:20.583 --> 15:21.667
Exactly how many--

15:21.709 --> 15:23.125
- Do you guys know who did it

15:21.709 --> 15:23.125
or not?!

15:23.166 --> 15:25.375
- Not. Which proves one thing:

15:25.417 --> 15:26.750
this case

15:25.417 --> 15:26.750
is unsolvable.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.625
Who wants donuts?

15:28.667 --> 15:31.500
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:28.667 --> 15:31.500
No case is unsolvable.

15:31.542 --> 15:34.250
- We're Mystery Solvers,

15:31.542 --> 15:34.250
not Mystery Quitters.

15:34.291 --> 15:36.458
- But since this case

15:34.291 --> 15:36.458
seems impossible,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.458
can't we move on to a different

15:36.500 --> 15:38.458
case? Like...

15:38.500 --> 15:40.667
I don't know, um,

15:40.709 --> 15:43.959
oh, who was behind

15:40.709 --> 15:43.959
Big Boy's demise?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.792
- Great! Dawn just saved us.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.792
- Well actually,

15:45.834 --> 15:47.792
it's the same case.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.125
We think toxic gas from

15:47.834 --> 15:49.125
the sinkhole

15:49.166 --> 15:50.875
was what spelled the end

15:49.166 --> 15:50.875
for Big Boy,

15:50.917 --> 15:52.750
so find the sinkers,

15:50.917 --> 15:52.750
find the killers!

15:52.792 --> 15:54.792
- Great. Dawn

15:52.792 --> 15:54.792
just sank us.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.709
- So tomorrow we go back

15:54.834 --> 15:56.709
to Rothschild Prep

15:56.750 --> 15:57.709
and look for clues.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.250
- I love it!

15:59.291 --> 16:01.000
- Will you excuse us

15:59.291 --> 16:01.000

16:03.625 --> 16:05.625
Clues! If they go there, they'll

16:03.625 --> 16:05.625
find our gardening gloves!

16:05.667 --> 16:07.417
They have our names on them!

16:12.667 --> 16:14.417
So we'll meet tomorrow morning

16:12.667 --> 16:14.417
at the scene of the crime

16:14.458 --> 16:16.500

16:14.458 --> 16:16.500

16:21.959 --> 16:24.041

- Bye, guys.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.500

16:26.542 --> 16:29.500

16:29.542 --> 16:32.500
- So when you say "get rid

16:29.542 --> 16:32.500
of those gloves,"

16:32.542 --> 16:34.333
you mean take, not throw away.

I mean, I spent a lot of time

16:34.375 --> 16:37.750

19:49.125 --> 19:50.250
- Yep, mystery solved.

19:50.291 --> 19:52.041
You can all go now.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.583
- Wait, why are you sitting in

19:52.083 --> 19:53.583
a bucket?

19:53.625 --> 19:56.500
- You know, I could ask you

19:53.625 --> 19:56.500
the same thing.

19:56.542 --> 20:00.333
- No you can't, 'cause I'm not

19:56.542 --> 20:00.333
sitting in a bucket.

20:00.375 --> 20:03.792
- Okay, I think it's obvious

20:00.375 --> 20:03.792
what's going on here.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.333
- These wolverine prints

20:03.834 --> 20:05.333
are fake

20:05.375 --> 20:06.875
and you're covering for the real

20:05.375 --> 20:06.875
guilty party.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.583
- The truth is...

20:08.625 --> 20:10.542
the Quads are guilty!

20:10.583 --> 20:11.917
[all gasp]

20:11.959 --> 20:14.417
- Of covering for you four!

20:14.458 --> 20:16.208
[together] What?!

20:16.250 --> 20:18.000
- I thought we were friends.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.250
But how can we be

20:18.041 --> 20:20.250
friends after this?

20:20.291 --> 20:21.917
- We're gonna tell the whole

20:20.291 --> 20:21.917
school what you did,

20:21.959 --> 20:23.917
and nobody's gonna want

20:21.959 --> 20:23.917
to be friends with you.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.583
- No, it wasn't them.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.000
[sighs deeply]

20:32.375 --> 20:33.625
It was us.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.792
both: What?

20:35.834 --> 20:39.625
- It's true. We sunk the school.

20:39.667 --> 20:40.959
- But it was an accident.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.417
- And we're sorry.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.125
- And scene!

20:48.208 --> 20:49.875
- Wait, w-what's going on?

20:49.917 --> 20:53.291
- Surprise! There is no Mystery

20:49.917 --> 20:53.291
Solvers Club.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.834
- We're all in the Drama Club.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.500
[all gasp]

20:56.542 --> 20:58.500
- Why would you do this?

20:58.542 --> 21:01.625
- Well, once we saw how weird

20:58.542 --> 21:01.625
you acted after the school sank,

21:01.667 --> 21:04.375
with all your giving us free ice

21:01.667 --> 21:04.375
cream, and your "what-what's,"

21:04.417 --> 21:06.333
we thought you might've had

21:04.417 --> 21:06.333
something to do with it.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.000
- And since you obviously

21:06.375 --> 21:08.000
weren't going to

21:08.041 --> 21:09.458
tell us the truth...

21:09.500 --> 21:11.417
- We had to find a way to get

21:09.500 --> 21:11.417
you to admit it.

21:11.458 --> 21:13.208
- So you could spend less time

21:11.458 --> 21:13.208
keeping secrets

21:13.250 --> 21:14.834
and more time making

21:13.250 --> 21:14.834
new friends.

21:17.917 --> 21:20.625
- Well, thank you.

21:20.667 --> 21:23.000
How about we start now?

21:23.041 --> 21:24.750
[grunts]

21:24.792 --> 21:26.709
If you don't mind,

21:26.750 --> 21:28.542
we would really like

21:26.750 --> 21:28.542
a third chance

21:28.583 --> 21:29.959
to make our

21:28.583 --> 21:29.959
first impression.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.458
- Oh, it's way too late

21:30.000 --> 21:32.458
for that.

21:32.500 --> 21:36.333
But it's never too late to make

21:32.500 --> 21:36.333
a new friend.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.250
- So you forgive us for sending

21:36.375 --> 21:38.250
Big Boy

21:38.291 --> 21:41.208
to the great big wolverine den

21:38.291 --> 21:41.208
in the sky?

21:41.250 --> 21:42.750
- Oh, you guys didn't

21:41.250 --> 21:42.750
kill our wolverine.

21:42.792 --> 21:45.250
He died of old age.

21:45.291 --> 21:48.625
- But is that our Big Boy

21:45.291 --> 21:48.625
statue?

21:48.667 --> 21:51.041
- You stole our statue?!

21:51.083 --> 21:53.917
- From our new friends.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.917
You guys.

21:53.959 --> 21:55.208
We're losing them.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.917
- I really wish we had

21:55.250 --> 21:56.917
a way out of this one.
