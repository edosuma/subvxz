WEBVTT

00:14.911 --> 00:16.947
Thanks so much for
coming on the show today.

00:16.982 --> 00:17.948
Well, my pleasure.

00:17.983 --> 00:19.260
Thanks for having me.

00:19.295 --> 00:20.951
And I can't believe
the success you've had.

00:20.986 --> 00:23.264
Your book and still
riding number one?

00:23.299 --> 00:24.610
Number one, New York Times.

00:24.645 --> 00:27.475
Yeah, so I'm very lucky
and I'm very grateful.

00:27.510 --> 00:31.479
And I know you can't say too
much about what's coming up,

00:31.514 --> 00:33.550
but it's my understanding
you're working

00:33.585 --> 00:37.451
on a book about mythology
in the Americas?

00:37.485 --> 00:38.624
Yeah, you're right.

00:38.659 --> 00:40.350
I can't really tell
you too much about it.

00:40.385 --> 00:42.214
But what I can say is
that it does squarely

00:42.249 --> 00:46.356
focus on the mythos and
mythology surrounding

00:46.391 --> 00:48.324
fear and the concept of fear.

00:48.358 --> 00:51.327
When can your fans
expect..

00:51.361 --> 00:54.744
I'm still really deep into
the research into the book.

00:54.778 --> 00:59.059
I to Northern
California to a very particular

00:59.093 --> 01:01.509
area that permeates fear.

01:01.544 --> 01:05.686
Fear, just as an emotion is
a manifestation of something

01:05.720 --> 01:08.861
that we always perceive
as just kind of a concept.

01:08.896 --> 01:09.690
It's not a concept.

01:09.724 --> 01:11.036
Fear is very real.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.451
Well, sounds like
The New York Times

01:12.486 --> 01:14.729
better make room for
another bestseller.

01:14.764 --> 01:15.627
I hope so.

01:15.661 --> 01:17.111
Your lips to God's ears.

01:17.146 --> 01:20.321
Diving this deeply into
fear, as you described it--

01:20.356 --> 01:21.150
Yeah.

01:21.184 --> 01:23.773
-does it strike fear in you?

01:23.807 --> 01:24.774
No.

03:09.879 --> 03:11.674
So we've
been covering this story

03:11.708 --> 03:14.953
for quite a while, but it
seems like today's news might

03:14.987 --> 03:19.820
be the final chapter in one of
the most bizarre stories we've

03:19.854 --> 03:23.272
had, the story of Angel Wilson.

03:23.306 --> 03:26.344
If you remember, Angel is
the missing 26-year-old

03:26.378 --> 03:30.762
from 2015 who was
camping in the Tahoe area

03:30.796 --> 03:32.212
and never returned home.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.074
Investigators--

03:33.109 --> 03:34.697
Babes, turn it off.

03:34.731 --> 03:35.456
Hold on, listen.

03:36.457 --> 03:37.769
Once they found

03:37.803 --> 03:39.771
that two of the friends
that had accompanied her

03:39.805 --> 03:42.670
were discovered deceased
from apparent suicide.

03:42.705 --> 03:43.844
Turn it off.

03:43.878 --> 03:45.190
And
today, news has broke

03:45.225 --> 03:47.123
that her remains might have--

03:48.331 --> 03:49.643
Said
that he's a Gemini.

03:49.677 --> 03:52.439
Said that he liked the
one to see her in that.

03:52.473 --> 03:55.269
Turned around and
changed his mind.

03:55.304 --> 03:58.479
Thank you, babe, for
getting me out of the house.

04:01.275 --> 04:05.935
We sure chose the best
time to get away, right?

04:05.969 --> 04:09.490
Was I driving you crazy or
were you driving me crazy?

04:09.525 --> 04:12.459
Why do you think I'm
taking you on this trip?

04:12.493 --> 04:13.874
Thank you.

04:13.908 --> 04:15.772
All right, but, listen, I just
don't want you all on top of me

04:15.807 --> 04:17.809
when you see what
I'm taking you, OK?

04:17.843 --> 04:19.776
Yeah, yeah, OK.

04:19.811 --> 04:21.606
You're going to have
to behave yourself.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.849
When's the last time
you saw me in a dress?

04:23.884 --> 04:24.850
It's been a while.

04:24.885 --> 04:25.955
Thank you for wearing it.

04:25.989 --> 04:27.922
I'm surprised it still fits.

04:27.957 --> 04:31.201
You look beautiful.

04:31.236 --> 04:31.961
Thank you.

04:31.995 --> 04:32.789
You're welcome.

04:32.824 --> 04:33.514
Thank you.

04:33.549 --> 04:34.826
Thank you.

04:34.860 --> 04:36.552
I needed to
get out of that office.

04:36.586 --> 04:38.347
Oh my god.

04:38.381 --> 04:39.209
What are you doing?

04:39.244 --> 04:41.142
You ready for this?

04:41.177 --> 04:42.558
What are you up to?

04:42.592 --> 04:43.835
Would you stop trying
to figure everything out?

04:43.869 --> 04:47.114
I told you, I want
this to be a surprise.

04:47.148 --> 04:49.358
So you're just going to get
out on the side of the road?

05:02.267 --> 05:04.511
Bianca, what are you doing?

05:04.545 --> 05:05.719
You don't have to wear that.

05:05.753 --> 05:06.858
Not up here.

05:06.892 --> 05:09.136
You have to wear this.

05:09.170 --> 05:10.758
I told you, I want
this to be a surprise.

05:10.793 --> 05:14.072
The only way that's going to
work is by blindfolding you.

05:14.106 --> 05:14.762
Please?

05:17.662 --> 05:20.596
I cannot believe I'm going
to let you blindfold me.

05:23.184 --> 05:26.774
I am the luckiest
man in the world.

05:31.779 --> 05:33.988
Yeah you are, you've
got two minutes.

05:34.023 --> 05:34.920
Two minutes.

05:35.714 --> 05:36.853
All I need.

05:42.203 --> 05:50.211
In my deep depress, I
am for a moment feels all up--

05:50.246 --> 05:51.178
wanted.

05:51.212 --> 05:53.214
Thought I was in control.

05:53.249 --> 05:54.906
That's a trick back.

05:54.940 --> 05:59.151
Thinking I had earned
love, going out bad.

05:59.186 --> 06:01.947
God, I'm scared of
me, afraid to speak.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.673
I've noticed.

06:03.708 --> 06:04.502
Every time--

06:04.536 --> 06:05.848
All right, stay put.

06:05.882 --> 06:07.090
Cannot believe
I let you blindfold me.

06:08.298 --> 06:09.817
It's
hard for me to see.

06:09.852 --> 06:11.267
Too fast.

06:11.301 --> 06:12.682
You've been good to us.

06:12.717 --> 06:13.718
Mademoiselle.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.446
You need your inhaler?

06:19.896 --> 06:21.381
Thank you.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.037
Just give me a second.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.803
You OK?

06:29.837 --> 06:30.873
Come on, get out here.

06:30.907 --> 06:32.461
Breathe some of this
clean mountain air.

06:32.495 --> 06:34.221
Oh, two seconds away
from taking this thing off.

06:34.255 --> 06:36.188
No, no, no, we're almost done.

06:36.223 --> 06:37.224
Five more steps.

06:37.258 --> 06:37.983
You're crazy.

06:38.881 --> 06:39.537
I miss--

06:39.571 --> 06:41.815
Step.

06:41.849 --> 06:43.575
Two steps.

06:43.610 --> 06:45.197
Lift up your right foot.

06:45.232 --> 06:46.095
Right.

06:46.129 --> 06:46.820
OK, I'm taking them off.

06:46.854 --> 06:48.166
No, not yet.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.512
Trying to find the perfect spot.

06:49.547 --> 06:50.375
Stay right there.

06:51.963 --> 06:53.827
Afraid that you got
to choose, help me decide.

06:53.861 --> 06:54.517
ROM: OK.

06:57.244 --> 06:58.072
You ready?

06:58.107 --> 06:58.797
Oh yeah, I'm ready.

06:59.695 --> 07:02.767
My tears-- will flow.

07:02.801 --> 07:03.526
Take it off.

07:10.637 --> 07:11.776
Oh, Rom.

07:15.952 --> 07:17.437
It's beautiful.

07:20.336 --> 07:21.026
What is this?

07:26.480 --> 07:27.930
We're here to
celebrate your birthday.

07:31.934 --> 07:35.144
I just figured everything that's
going on in the world right now

07:35.178 --> 07:37.595
and me finally getting the
book to the publishers--

07:37.629 --> 07:39.044
Happy birthday Bianca!

07:39.079 --> 07:39.735
Bianca!

07:39.769 --> 07:41.737
Oh my god.

07:43.773 --> 07:45.119
Oh my god!

07:45.154 --> 07:45.982
Go say hi.

07:46.017 --> 07:48.329
Come on, go, go, go!

07:48.364 --> 07:49.814
What?

07:49.848 --> 07:50.918
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday, baby.

07:53.852 --> 07:54.404
Who?

07:54.439 --> 07:55.129
Who do I give--

07:55.164 --> 07:56.303
Me, me, me.

07:56.337 --> 07:57.407
Happy birthday.

07:57.442 --> 07:58.201
Beautiful.

07:58.236 --> 07:59.202
Oh my god.

08:13.389 --> 08:14.045
Oh!

08:18.981 --> 08:19.947
Happy birthday!

08:19.982 --> 08:20.948
Happy birthday!

08:20.983 --> 08:21.915
Woo!

08:24.158 --> 08:26.436
All right, guys, look
what we have for you.

08:26.471 --> 08:27.299
Come on in.

08:27.334 --> 08:28.059
- What?
- Wow.

08:28.093 --> 08:29.060
Check It out.

08:29.094 --> 08:30.026
Check it out.

08:30.061 --> 08:30.820
Wow.

08:30.855 --> 08:31.441
Look at this.

08:31.476 --> 08:31.994
Look at that, huh?

08:34.859 --> 08:36.067
What up, dog!

08:36.101 --> 08:36.826
Ah.

08:36.861 --> 08:37.586
Yeah, yeah.

08:38.069 --> 08:38.966
Lou.

08:39.001 --> 08:40.002
Hey.

08:40.036 --> 08:41.037
Yes.

08:42.591 --> 08:44.213
I am so sorry I'm late.

08:44.247 --> 08:45.145
He didn't do it.

08:45.179 --> 08:46.595
What do you mean?

08:46.629 --> 08:47.527
Did you give him the ring?

08:47.561 --> 08:48.597
He had the ring.

08:48.631 --> 08:49.667
I think he got nervous.

08:49.701 --> 08:50.460
Nervous?

08:50.495 --> 08:51.289
Does she know?
Lou!

08:51.323 --> 08:52.186
Hey.

08:52.221 --> 08:53.809
Do my eyes deceive me?

08:53.843 --> 08:56.190
Forest Park's finest Lou Powell.

08:56.225 --> 08:57.675
What up?

08:57.709 --> 08:59.366
Ah, it means so much to me.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.332
Thank you.

09:00.367 --> 09:01.817
How could I not?

09:01.851 --> 09:03.404
Hey, when was the last
time all of us were together?

09:03.439 --> 09:04.233
Year ago, Detroit.

09:04.267 --> 09:05.372
I don't know.

09:05.406 --> 09:06.546
Was it that night
at Coney Island?

09:06.580 --> 09:08.064
Coney Island, yeah,
back in the day.

09:08.099 --> 09:10.032
Oh my god.

09:10.066 --> 09:10.964
I miss y'all.

09:10.998 --> 09:11.965
The D's big three, yeah.

09:11.999 --> 09:15.071
Yo, man, Lou wants
to talk to you.

09:15.106 --> 09:16.038
What's up, Lou?

09:16.072 --> 09:17.418
What happened?

09:17.453 --> 09:18.454
Thanks, Russ.

09:18.488 --> 09:20.214
You wasn't going to tell him.

09:20.249 --> 09:21.940
Bro, everybody came here.

09:21.975 --> 09:22.976
It was perfect.

09:23.010 --> 09:23.563
What happened?

09:23.597 --> 09:24.598
I don't know.

09:24.633 --> 09:25.703
I can't believe I did it again.

09:25.737 --> 09:26.911
Again?

09:26.945 --> 09:29.016
How many proposals
have you botched?

09:29.051 --> 09:30.811
Three, four, four.

09:30.846 --> 09:31.881
Four?

09:31.916 --> 09:33.434
This is number four,
lucky number four.

09:33.469 --> 09:34.781
Well, at least
you're consistent.

09:34.815 --> 09:35.885
It wasn't the right time.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.506
Right time?

09:36.541 --> 09:37.335
You had the ring?

09:37.369 --> 09:38.094
I had the ring.

09:38.129 --> 09:39.095
She was there?

09:39.130 --> 09:40.614
Yeah.

09:40.649 --> 09:41.546
So what the fuck you mean
it wasn't the right time.

09:42.754 --> 09:43.962
Lou, Lou, Lou,
chill, chill, chill.

09:43.997 --> 09:44.929
Look, look, look,
we're here for you.

09:44.963 --> 09:45.723
We got tested.

09:45.757 --> 09:47.103
We came here to support you.

09:47.138 --> 09:50.210
Whatever goes down out
here, we're your boys.

09:50.244 --> 09:50.969
Grow a pair.

09:51.004 --> 09:51.487
Get a ring.

09:51.521 --> 09:52.557
Hit a knee.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.076
Let's put a ring
on her finger.

09:54.110 --> 09:55.422
Can we do that, gentlemen?
That's what I'm saying.

09:55.456 --> 09:56.112
That's what I'm saying.
All right?

09:56.147 --> 09:57.424
All right.

09:57.458 --> 09:58.598
OK, look, the weekend
is not over with.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.357
I'm going to find
the perfect time.

09:59.391 --> 09:59.944
Guys--

09:59.978 --> 10:00.530
OK?

10:00.565 --> 10:01.497
Just trust me.

10:01.531 --> 10:02.671
Guys, guys, guys.

10:02.705 --> 10:03.361
Big three from
the D. Let's get it.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.742
Let's go.

10:04.776 --> 10:05.605
I'm going to make it
happen, three from the D.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.192
Big three from the D.

10:07.227 --> 10:08.400
Big three from the D.

10:08.435 --> 10:09.574
All right, everyone,
gather round.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.333
Gather round.

10:10.368 --> 10:11.507
Gather round.

10:11.541 --> 10:13.060
Got the whole
weekend to catch up.

10:13.095 --> 10:15.891
Now that we're all here, I'd
like to be the first to say,

10:15.925 --> 10:18.065
welcome to the historic
Strawberry Lodge.

10:18.100 --> 10:21.655
We've got this all to ourselves
for the entire weekend.

10:21.690 --> 10:23.415
Not exactly the Four Seasons.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.141
More like one season, fall--

10:25.176 --> 10:25.935
ing apart.

10:27.212 --> 10:29.180
Oh, god, OK, come on, guys.

10:33.391 --> 10:34.254
Thank you, Benny.

10:34.288 --> 10:35.531
But we don't need that.

10:35.565 --> 10:37.050
All right?

10:37.084 --> 10:40.570
I would like you all to
meet the lovely Ms. Winrich.

10:40.605 --> 10:41.468
Thank you.

10:41.502 --> 10:42.676
Good evening, everyone.

10:42.711 --> 10:46.093
And welcome to the
Strawberry Lodge.

10:46.128 --> 10:48.648
I'm absolutely sure
that you'll all come

10:48.682 --> 10:51.961
to love it as much as I do.

10:51.996 --> 10:52.962
I'm so sorry.

10:52.997 --> 10:54.619
I didn't mean any
disrespect by it.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.585
Sometimes, I just mess
around with Michael to bring

10:55.620 --> 10:56.863
his ego down a few notches.

10:56.897 --> 10:58.209
The place is actually
really beautiful.

10:58.243 --> 10:59.935
I took some pictures earlier.

10:59.969 --> 11:01.833
Hm.

11:01.868 --> 11:05.699
Ms. Winrich was kind enough
to open up this entire lodge

11:05.734 --> 11:09.461
especially for us and was
also the maestro in helping

11:09.496 --> 11:10.877
make this an A1 weekend.

11:10.911 --> 11:15.157
So, basically, be
nice, assholes.

11:15.191 --> 11:19.437
I'd like to ask you to
gather together for one photo.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.992
It's an old tradition
we have here.

11:23.027 --> 11:25.823
We like to memorialize
all who stay with us.

11:25.857 --> 11:28.239
That way, you never leave.

11:31.035 --> 11:32.968
I feel like I'm in
"Get Out" right now.

11:33.002 --> 11:34.832
All right, guys,
let's go, let's go.

11:34.866 --> 11:36.350
All right, all right.

11:36.385 --> 11:37.489
Don't dirty up my white.

11:37.524 --> 11:38.214
I feel good.

11:38.249 --> 11:39.146
I feel good.

11:39.181 --> 11:39.699
Let me get on of you.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.079
There you go.

11:41.114 --> 11:43.910
All right, then on three,
one, two, oh.

11:43.944 --> 11:45.256
Oh!

11:46.878 --> 11:48.190
Can we do one more for us?

11:50.123 --> 11:52.366
OK, shout out to the
time machine she used

11:52.401 --> 11:54.714
to go get that Polaroid camera.

11:54.748 --> 11:55.473
Three--

11:55.507 --> 11:56.163
OK.

11:56.198 --> 11:56.646
All right.

11:56.681 --> 11:57.406
Thank you.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.441
All right.

11:58.476 --> 11:59.132
Thank you.

12:00.996 --> 12:02.204
You're going to the guest one.

12:02.238 --> 12:03.032
Good to see you.

12:04.137 --> 12:05.897
It's such a pleasure
to have you with us.

12:05.932 --> 12:09.176
I want to welcome you
especially to Strawberry Lodge.

12:09.211 --> 12:10.730
Thank you.

12:10.764 --> 12:14.388
You carry the light, my dear.

12:14.423 --> 12:17.115
I can see it.

12:17.150 --> 12:17.806
You're a beacon.

12:23.328 --> 12:24.433
Congratulations.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.055
Ah--

12:26.090 --> 12:29.265
Yes, yes, we're all very proud
that Rom finished his new book.

12:29.300 --> 12:30.888
In fact, you know what?

12:30.922 --> 12:32.752
Before we leave, I'll
get you a signed copy.

12:32.786 --> 12:33.683
How's that?

12:33.718 --> 12:35.168
That would be lovely.

12:35.202 --> 12:36.963
And I have something
for you before I

12:36.997 --> 12:38.309
leave you guys for the weekend.

12:38.343 --> 12:38.965
Me?

12:38.999 --> 12:39.897
Yes.

12:39.931 --> 12:41.415
I'd like to give this to you.

12:41.450 --> 12:42.865
It's our own bottle of wine.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.660
This place just keeps
getting better and better.

12:44.694 --> 12:46.800
This is something we
give all our guests.

12:46.835 --> 12:48.077
Thank you very much.

12:48.112 --> 12:49.941
I'll make sure we toast
with this tonight.

12:54.394 --> 12:55.084
Wow.

12:58.847 --> 13:00.020
You know what?

13:00.055 --> 13:00.883
Being out in the
mountains is probably

13:00.918 --> 13:02.022
what the doctor ordered.

13:02.057 --> 13:03.368
No, what the
doctor's ordered is

13:03.403 --> 13:05.474
for us to be social
distanced and sanitize

13:05.508 --> 13:06.613
every time we blink.

13:06.647 --> 13:08.788
Can you for once
stop being a nurse

13:08.822 --> 13:10.237
and try to have a good time?

13:10.272 --> 13:14.690
We're 106.

13:14.724 --> 13:15.622
Here we go.

13:15.656 --> 13:18.590
Look, right here.

13:18.625 --> 13:22.698
Whatever's in this
old ass room, woosah.

13:22.732 --> 13:25.011
We're going to
appreciate it, all right?

13:25.045 --> 13:25.701
All right.

13:29.049 --> 13:29.739
Oh.

13:33.536 --> 13:35.193
OK.

13:35.228 --> 13:36.367
This is cool.

13:36.401 --> 13:38.093
It's cute.

13:38.127 --> 13:38.679
It's not bad.

13:55.041 --> 13:56.421
What is she looking at?

14:08.399 --> 14:10.746
White people are into
some strange shit.

14:22.378 --> 14:23.586
You like it?

14:23.621 --> 14:25.726
Yeah.

14:25.761 --> 14:28.074
It's rustic, isn't it?

14:28.108 --> 14:30.904
You know, this place
was built in 1838.

14:30.939 --> 14:34.011
Burned down, got rebuilt in '53.

14:34.045 --> 14:38.222
This looks like the
original furniture.

14:38.256 --> 14:39.430
It's so beautiful.

14:39.464 --> 14:42.951
And all the history here,
Native American culture,

14:42.985 --> 14:44.607
into the Spanish.

14:44.642 --> 14:47.438
Gold rush happened right
here, just down all the way

14:47.472 --> 14:49.129
from Sonora up to Tahoe.

14:53.754 --> 14:56.412
Everything OK?

14:56.447 --> 14:59.036
You didn't have to do this.

14:59.070 --> 15:00.623
I did.

15:00.658 --> 15:04.110
I did have to do this.

15:04.144 --> 15:05.766
For you.

15:05.801 --> 15:06.836
For us.

15:06.871 --> 15:08.321
My birthday was
a week ago, Rom.

15:08.355 --> 15:10.875
But these last couple
years have been crazy for us,

15:10.910 --> 15:12.981
between you getting your
doctorate in religion

15:13.015 --> 15:18.089
and me finally finding
a little bit of success.

15:18.124 --> 15:25.372
Besides, this place, there's
so much history right here.

15:25.407 --> 15:27.098
OK, there you go.

15:27.133 --> 15:30.377
So you're already writing
your next book now?

15:30.412 --> 15:31.171
No, no, I--

15:31.206 --> 15:32.310
I know what it looks like.

15:32.345 --> 15:34.519
But I promise you,
it's not that.

15:34.554 --> 15:35.210
Hey.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.768
I just wanted you to
have this trip to remind

15:41.802 --> 15:45.530
you how special you are to me.

15:45.565 --> 15:48.844
My
dear, you're a beacon.

15:48.878 --> 15:49.534
Stop.

15:54.884 --> 15:57.957
Your nose, it's bleeding.

16:03.755 --> 16:07.518
You OK

16:07.552 --> 16:10.383
Yeah, fine.

16:10.417 --> 16:11.246
Are you sure?

16:11.280 --> 16:13.144
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

16:13.179 --> 16:17.666
I'm going to go hang out with
the girls for a little bit.

16:17.700 --> 16:18.701
Cool?

16:18.736 --> 16:21.014
Yeah, totally cool.

16:36.512 --> 16:38.445
Bye-bye, Mrs. Winrich.

16:39.205 --> 16:39.929
She got a--

16:43.830 --> 16:45.694
No, no, no, no, I correct you.

16:45.728 --> 16:47.765
As of two weeks
ago, Rom Jennings

16:47.799 --> 16:49.905
is a bestselling author.

16:49.939 --> 16:51.907
Did I not tell you
a year ago that we'd

16:51.941 --> 16:54.047
be having this conversation?

16:54.082 --> 16:56.843
What does it matter what
anyone says about this deal

16:56.877 --> 16:58.810
if I'm his agent?

16:58.845 --> 16:59.535
Hello?

17:00.364 --> 17:01.261
Oh, you fucker.

17:01.296 --> 17:01.917
Come on.

17:01.951 --> 17:03.194
Give me a bar.

17:03.229 --> 17:05.438
Give me a bar in this old bitch.

17:05.472 --> 17:06.025
Woo!

17:13.204 --> 17:13.653
Hey.

17:13.687 --> 17:14.343
Hey, Mike.

17:17.588 --> 17:20.453
I want you to forget
about what happened outside.

17:21.661 --> 17:24.146
No, listen, do not give
yourself a hard time.

17:24.181 --> 17:25.044
There's a lot of people.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.149
That's a lot pressure.

17:27.184 --> 17:28.909
Rom, it's going to
be a great weekend.

17:28.944 --> 17:30.187
You're going to turn it around.

17:30.221 --> 17:31.326
You're going to get
it done, all right?

17:31.360 --> 17:33.259
It's going to work
out great, OK?

17:33.293 --> 17:34.501
OK.

17:34.536 --> 17:36.917
Listen, in other news,
the phone has been ringing.

17:36.952 --> 17:38.850
And I know you've
been doing research.

17:38.885 --> 17:41.232
I'm going to need an outline
from you sooner or later.

17:41.267 --> 17:42.371
I don't want to talk
about that right now.

17:42.406 --> 17:43.717
- Rom, forget it.
- Not right now.

17:43.752 --> 17:44.649
I'm not even
talking about work.

17:44.684 --> 17:45.961
Who's talking about work?

17:45.995 --> 17:47.549
But-- I need fucking
outline, all right?

17:47.583 --> 17:48.239
OK?

17:48.274 --> 17:49.378
OK.

17:49.413 --> 17:51.104
All right, listen, 30
minutes, I want everyone

17:51.139 --> 17:53.831
changed over by the firepit.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.074
I'll arrange something special.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.385
It's going to be a vibe.

17:56.420 --> 17:57.697
The girls are going
to love it, all right?

17:57.731 --> 17:58.594
Thank you, Michael.

17:58.629 --> 17:59.319
I got you.

17:59.354 --> 18:00.320
We're good.

18:00.355 --> 18:04.600
This place is
perfect for both of us.

18:04.635 --> 18:05.946
Take this.

18:05.981 --> 18:06.809
Go and have fun with
your friends, all right?

18:06.844 --> 18:08.570
Thanks.

18:13.989 --> 18:15.301
You know that
lady from earlier?

18:15.335 --> 18:16.129
Mm-hm.

18:16.164 --> 18:17.441
You think she's leaving soon?

18:17.475 --> 18:20.237
Because she don't got
a sign on the desk.

18:20.271 --> 18:21.790
She's already left, babe.

18:21.824 --> 18:25.311
But, apparently, it's
actually a really cool story.

18:25.345 --> 18:28.037
So her family bought
the lodge when it first

18:28.072 --> 18:30.868
burnt down in the late 1800s.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.041
They rebuilt what
was left of it.

18:32.076 --> 18:33.595
They renamed it
Strawberry Lodge.

18:33.629 --> 18:36.115
And now they rent it out
to people on the weekends.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.530
Who told you all this?

18:37.564 --> 18:38.220
Rom.

18:41.396 --> 18:42.949
What?

18:42.983 --> 18:45.054
Rom think he's so slick.

18:45.089 --> 18:46.504
Why do you say that?

18:46.539 --> 18:48.161
Rom brought us out here
to do research for his book.

18:48.196 --> 18:50.819
This whole thing is like
the backdrop for another Rom

18:50.853 --> 18:52.510
Jennings bestselling novel.

18:53.028 --> 18:53.718
Oh!

18:56.135 --> 18:57.205
Stay right there.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.696
You OK?

19:05.730 --> 19:08.077
Guys, firepit, please.

19:08.112 --> 19:10.701
Everyone's waiting.

19:10.735 --> 19:12.461
All right, for
anybody who's interested,

19:12.496 --> 19:14.877
this quaint little mountain town
that we're in right now used

19:14.912 --> 19:16.948
to be part of Mexico
until 1848 when

19:16.983 --> 19:18.364
it was ceded to United States.

19:18.398 --> 19:21.884
And then became Strawberry,
California in '49,

19:21.919 --> 19:23.300
during the Gold Rush.

19:23.334 --> 19:25.543
Now, the gold
brought belligerent,

19:25.578 --> 19:28.236
but determined
miners and outlaws,

19:28.270 --> 19:32.240
fueled by whiskey and greed.

19:32.274 --> 19:37.900
Now, they came here for one
reason and one reason only--

19:37.935 --> 19:38.660
gold!

19:38.694 --> 19:39.799
Oh my-- stop!

19:41.663 --> 19:42.698
Stop.

19:42.733 --> 19:43.768
You can't.

19:43.803 --> 19:45.080
Yo, I'mma go inside if y'all

19:45.114 --> 19:45.943
keep going.

19:45.977 --> 19:46.978
No, no, keep going.

19:47.013 --> 19:47.669
Keep going, Rom.
Keep going.

19:49.395 --> 19:51.673
And they got their
gold, all right.

19:51.707 --> 19:55.332
So these miners began
to prey on the natives.

19:55.366 --> 19:57.368
They went into their
villages and stole

19:57.403 --> 20:00.164
their women during the night.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.650
And these women decided
they had had enough.

20:03.685 --> 20:05.445
And they made a pact.

20:05.480 --> 20:10.830
They called themselves
las bruja and set it up

20:10.864 --> 20:13.004
so they would control the town.

20:13.039 --> 20:14.661
Documented reports
state that these women

20:14.696 --> 20:16.491
were able to control
the miners minds

20:16.525 --> 20:18.389
and make them hallucinate
to the point they

20:18.424 --> 20:20.529
were so frightened
they would kill

20:20.564 --> 20:22.531
themselves to escape the fear.

20:22.566 --> 20:23.152
Bullshit.

20:25.016 --> 20:26.811
Bro, why would
you tell us right

20:26.846 --> 20:27.881
now when we've got to go sleep?

20:27.916 --> 20:28.882
How am I going to sleep tonight?

20:28.917 --> 20:31.471
Oh, that baby's scared.

20:31.506 --> 20:34.681
I think we can all agree
that if we've learned anything,

20:34.716 --> 20:38.167
it's that we've had to
face a lot of fears.

20:38.202 --> 20:42.275
And I am so fucking
tired of being scared--

20:42.310 --> 20:44.312
scared of going outside,
scared of taking

20:44.346 --> 20:47.970
chances, scared of doing
the things we love.

20:48.005 --> 20:50.835
So why don't we make a pact?

20:50.870 --> 20:57.739
Let's all tell each other
our most personal fears

20:57.773 --> 21:01.121
and just let them go.

21:01.156 --> 21:05.609
Fear will not rule
us here, not tonight.

21:05.643 --> 21:06.437
Let's do it.

21:09.164 --> 21:11.787
I'll start.

21:11.822 --> 21:15.239
When I was 18 years
old, I got hit by a car.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.657
And in that moment,
I wasn't in control.

21:19.692 --> 21:21.694
It was terrifying.

21:21.728 --> 21:26.250
And the only thing that didn't
break was this necklace.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.218
So my greatest fear
is losing control.

21:31.773 --> 21:34.362
And as long as I
wear this necklace,

21:34.396 --> 21:37.123
no matter what life
brings me, I know that I'm

21:37.157 --> 21:39.056
going to be in control.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.024
OK, who's next?

21:42.059 --> 21:43.957
Birthday girl?

21:43.992 --> 21:46.305
Where do I start?

21:46.339 --> 21:48.790
Growing up in a
religious household,

21:48.824 --> 21:52.759
I feared the consequences
of losing my faith.

21:52.794 --> 21:55.797
It's why I read a Bible
verse every night,

21:55.831 --> 21:57.695
pray without ceasing.

21:57.730 --> 22:00.491
Being an asthmatic, air
is so precious to me.

22:00.526 --> 22:04.081
And now that air could kill me.

22:04.115 --> 22:06.704
My biggest fear
has become losing

22:06.739 --> 22:10.812
the thing I took for granted
the most, just breathing.

22:10.846 --> 22:12.192
Wow, OK.

22:12.227 --> 22:13.539
I'll take-- I'll
take a shot at it.

22:13.573 --> 22:16.404
You know, where we
come from in Detroit,

22:16.438 --> 22:19.545
you know, there's not a lot
of options or opportunities.

22:19.579 --> 22:23.618
I made a promise to
everyone that I would make

22:23.652 --> 22:26.137
it out of there no matter what.

22:26.172 --> 22:28.347
And my word is my
bond, always has been.

22:28.381 --> 22:33.386
What we're from, it'll
kill you if it isn't.

22:33.421 --> 22:38.978
So I have to say my biggest
fear is not being trusted,

22:39.012 --> 22:41.705
especially by the people
who are depending on me.

22:46.675 --> 22:48.815
So back in the
day, Lou convinces

22:48.850 --> 22:52.509
me and Rom to go to the movies
and see "Boyz n the Hood."

22:52.543 --> 22:54.545
At the end of the movie when
Morris Chestnut is running

22:54.580 --> 22:56.616
and he gets sprayed in
the chest and blood starts

22:56.651 --> 22:58.031
flying all over the place--

22:58.066 --> 23:00.240
Oh, man, before me and
Lou had to carry you out,

23:00.275 --> 23:01.932
you're staring at the
screen in a trance.

23:01.966 --> 23:03.140
And you just go, "Ricky!"

23:03.174 --> 23:03.865
"Ricky!"

23:06.005 --> 23:07.040
So good.

23:07.075 --> 23:09.284
What is your fear specifically?

23:09.318 --> 23:10.734
My biggest fear is blood.

23:10.768 --> 23:14.462
There's just something about
it that I can't handle.

23:14.496 --> 23:17.534
So my biggest
fear, as a mother,

23:17.568 --> 23:22.228
is honestly just not being
able to provide for my son.

23:22.262 --> 23:25.127
My biggest fear is drowning.

23:25.162 --> 23:26.059
I can't swim.

23:26.094 --> 23:27.406
Except for baths.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.856
This woman will take a
bath for three hours.

23:30.581 --> 23:31.927
Oh, man.

23:31.962 --> 23:34.758
Claustrophobia, 100%.

23:34.792 --> 23:37.657
When I was a kid, my
older brother used to lock

23:37.692 --> 23:39.659
me in the drawer under my bed.

23:39.694 --> 23:41.661
Used to be locked
in there for hours

23:41.696 --> 23:44.181
in the dark flailing around.

23:46.873 --> 23:49.945
So, yeah, that's why I'm
getting cremated when I die.

23:49.980 --> 23:53.880
Small, confined spaces,
coffins, not for me.

23:53.915 --> 23:56.227
I was in high school.

23:56.262 --> 23:57.574
I got pulled over.

23:57.608 --> 23:58.713
Cop didn't give me a reason.

23:58.747 --> 24:00.749
He just reached
inside my window,

24:00.784 --> 24:04.373
snatched me out, slammed my
head on the hood of the car.

24:04.408 --> 24:05.858
I was terrified.

24:05.892 --> 24:10.932
So I say, fuck the cops
and fuck handcuffs.

24:10.966 --> 24:13.313
That's easy for me.

24:13.348 --> 24:15.868
My biggest fear is losing you.

24:15.902 --> 24:17.352
Bullshit.

24:20.804 --> 24:23.323
I'll tell you what, you
guys put this fire out.

24:23.358 --> 24:24.670
Let's set things up inside.

24:24.704 --> 24:25.981
I'm going to get
that bottle of wine

24:26.016 --> 24:28.190
that the lovely Mrs.
Winrich gave us, yeah?

24:28.225 --> 24:28.881
Woo!

24:28.915 --> 24:30.123
To us.

24:30.158 --> 24:31.504
Best weekend of our lives.

24:31.539 --> 24:34.334
Cheers to a great
weekend and happy birthday.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.404
-Hey, Michael.
-What's up, Michael?

25:44.439 --> 25:45.371
Where you been?

25:45.405 --> 25:45.992
We've been waiting on you.

25:46.027 --> 25:47.097
Michael.

25:47.131 --> 25:53.172
Just, uh, so I know
I keep saying this,

25:53.206 --> 25:56.106
but you guys have no idea
what a great weekend we

25:56.140 --> 25:57.728
have ahead of us.

25:57.763 --> 25:59.040
Thanks for all being here.

25:59.074 --> 26:02.043
So let's, let's kind of
close this evening off

26:02.077 --> 26:06.495
with a nice toast to
the birthday girl--

26:06.530 --> 26:08.083
Thank you.

26:08.118 --> 26:11.742
-to new books, being with
people you love in crazy times.

26:11.777 --> 26:12.191
Yeah?

26:12.225 --> 26:13.364
Mm-hm.

26:13.399 --> 26:14.020
All right, let's
get some glasses.

26:14.883 --> 26:15.815
What did she drink tonight?

26:16.782 --> 26:17.196
Whoa.

26:18.197 --> 26:19.163
There we go.

26:21.545 --> 26:23.064
That's the spirit
we need though.

26:23.098 --> 26:23.996
That's the spirit we need.

26:24.030 --> 26:24.479
Hey.

26:24.513 --> 26:25.273
Cheers.

26:25.307 --> 26:25.963
Cheers.

26:25.998 --> 26:26.515
Cheers.

26:26.550 --> 26:27.620
Yeah, salud.

26:28.310 --> 26:29.415
Cheers.

26:29.449 --> 26:30.312
Woo.

26:30.347 --> 26:31.831
And to Bianca.

26:31.866 --> 26:33.005
La familia.

26:33.039 --> 26:33.557
Yes.

26:41.082 --> 26:42.048
Oh.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.463
Mm.

26:43.498 --> 26:45.845
Oh my god.

26:45.880 --> 26:46.846
Mm.

26:46.881 --> 26:48.814
Mm.

26:56.407 --> 26:59.031
Yo, what the fuck
is in here, man?

27:00.929 --> 27:01.689
The fuck?

27:01.723 --> 27:03.725
What the fuck is this shit?

27:03.760 --> 27:04.933
This is why I
don't fucking drink.

27:04.968 --> 27:06.590
Please, just put
your glasses down.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.936
Maybe it's just old wine?

27:07.971 --> 27:09.179
Let's just forget it happened.

27:09.213 --> 27:10.352
Uh-uh.

27:10.387 --> 27:11.630
If anybody wants
to drink any more,

27:11.664 --> 27:12.803
there's a couple more
bottles of champagne

27:12.838 --> 27:14.287
and a bottle of
tequila at the bar.

27:14.322 --> 27:16.151
It's got like a-- it's got
like an aftertaste to it.

27:16.186 --> 27:17.290
Let's go.

27:17.325 --> 27:18.153
Sandpaper or something.

27:18.188 --> 27:19.327
Guys!

27:19.361 --> 27:20.259
No, but seriously,
what was that?

27:20.293 --> 27:21.156
I have no idea.

27:21.191 --> 27:21.916
What did it taste like?

27:21.950 --> 27:22.675
Uh, man, go.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.125
Throw that shit away, man.

27:24.159 --> 27:26.058
I will.

27:26.092 --> 27:27.818
It's disgusting, man.

27:27.853 --> 27:28.439
1938?

27:52.705 --> 27:55.812
God's word is sure.

27:55.846 --> 27:58.607
When God begins to
speak,

27:58.642 --> 28:00.989
will rise up and live.

28:01.024 --> 28:03.923
And things that ought to be
dead will lay down and die.

28:03.958 --> 28:08.687
When the word of the lord God
can speak a word to you and and

28:08.721 --> 28:09.757
shall be healed!

28:09.791 --> 28:11.551
Hey, I'm sorry about the wine.

28:14.002 --> 28:16.315
How do we know everyone got
tested before we came up here?

28:18.835 --> 28:19.801
Because everyone got tested.

28:19.836 --> 28:21.147
What are you talking about?

28:21.182 --> 28:22.321
I mean, how do we know?

28:22.355 --> 28:24.150
Because I arranged the test.

28:24.185 --> 28:24.806
That's how we know.

28:24.841 --> 28:25.565
What's the problem?

28:25.600 --> 28:27.533
Lou.

28:27.567 --> 28:28.327
What about Lou?

28:28.361 --> 28:29.880
Lou is sick.

28:29.915 --> 28:31.019
Dude, Lou's not sick.

28:31.054 --> 28:32.711
He got tested like
everyone else.

28:32.745 --> 28:33.988
And how do you know he
physically went and got tested?

28:34.022 --> 28:35.644
Bro, I'm telling you,
I've been watching him.

28:35.679 --> 28:37.405
Ever since we got here,
he's been coughing.

28:37.439 --> 28:39.925
And not just easy cough, like
he's been coughing up a lung.

28:39.959 --> 28:40.891
I'm telling you, he's sick--

28:40.926 --> 28:42.203
Benny, Benny, relax, relax.

28:42.237 --> 28:44.343
On my way to bed,
I will go and check

28:44.377 --> 28:45.931
on Lou, make sure he's OK.

28:45.965 --> 28:50.142
I need you to concentrate on
having a good time, all right?

28:50.176 --> 28:51.557
Relax.

28:51.591 --> 28:53.317
And if
god is panicking, oh my god.

28:53.352 --> 28:55.803
You may as well slit your
wrists and your throat.

29:07.504 --> 29:09.506
What are you doing?

29:09.540 --> 29:12.681
Mrs. Winrich low
key got some classics.

29:12.716 --> 29:14.373
Let me find out.

29:15.408 --> 29:17.617
Oh, oh, baby girl.

29:20.897 --> 29:23.451
You ain't getting
none to that music.

29:23.485 --> 29:24.970
We'll see about that.

29:28.283 --> 29:29.146
Good night.

29:29.181 --> 29:29.837
Good night.

29:29.871 --> 29:31.459
Sorry about the wine.

29:31.493 --> 29:33.633
No worries.

29:34.842 --> 29:38.293
Hey, Lou, what a night, huh?

29:41.296 --> 29:42.021
What up, doe?

29:44.299 --> 29:47.371
Listen, I want to
ask you a question.

29:47.406 --> 29:48.821
Don't take it personally.

29:48.856 --> 29:50.616
I feel very stupid even asking.

29:50.650 --> 29:52.066
Nah, no stupid
questions, go ahead.

29:52.100 --> 29:52.894
Shoot.

29:52.929 --> 29:54.758
OK, OK, how are you feeling?

29:54.793 --> 29:55.759
You feeling all right?

29:58.451 --> 29:59.556
What?

29:59.590 --> 30:00.453
How am I feeling?

30:00.488 --> 30:01.765
I feel fine.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.388
Yeah, you know, not
me, you know, a couple

30:04.423 --> 30:05.424
of-- a couple of the others--

30:05.458 --> 30:06.839
A couple of the others?

30:06.874 --> 30:08.565
Yeah, a couple of the
other guys mentioned they

30:08.599 --> 30:09.462
saw you coughing--

30:09.497 --> 30:10.739
So you came up here--

30:10.774 --> 30:11.499
Absolutely not.

30:11.533 --> 30:12.258
-to accuse--

30:12.293 --> 30:13.087
Absolutely not.

30:13.121 --> 30:15.192
-me of being contagious--

30:15.227 --> 30:16.331
No--

30:16.366 --> 30:18.402
-of a disease and
being willing to spread

30:18.437 --> 30:19.956
it to my closest friends.

30:19.990 --> 30:21.267
That's what you're saying?

30:21.302 --> 30:22.959
No, I'm just trying
to keep everything safe.

30:22.993 --> 30:25.478
What gives you the right
to come up here and check me?

30:25.513 --> 30:26.825
Just crossing the--

30:26.859 --> 30:28.447
crossing the T, dotting
the I's, making sure--

30:28.481 --> 30:31.484
Nah, man, I'm going to
dot your I. How about that?

30:31.519 --> 30:34.004
How about I dot your I.

30:34.039 --> 30:35.040
Mm--

30:35.074 --> 30:36.248
Man, get out from
in front of my door.

30:36.282 --> 30:36.973
I feel fine.

30:37.007 --> 30:38.491
There's no need to get--

30:38.526 --> 30:39.561
I took a test just like all
of you other motherfuckers

30:39.596 --> 30:40.390
took a test.

30:40.424 --> 30:41.632
Fuck out my face.

30:41.667 --> 30:44.014
Squirrely mouth
looking motherfucker.

30:44.049 --> 30:46.637
It's been good that
we've been getting

30:46.672 --> 30:47.880
closer over the last few years.

30:47.915 --> 30:48.985
You're still here?

30:49.019 --> 30:49.675
I'm going.
I'm going.

30:49.709 --> 30:50.572
Goodnight.

30:50.607 --> 30:52.298
If you need anything.

30:53.161 --> 30:54.645
Please come home.

30:54.680 --> 31:00.548
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby girl.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.598
Murder-suicide, suicide,

31:16.633 --> 31:18.186
suicide.

31:18.221 --> 31:19.153
Murder-suicide.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.468
Murder-suicide.

31:24.503 --> 31:26.401
Suicide, suicide.

31:26.436 --> 31:27.713
The body of a woman inside.

31:27.747 --> 31:29.025
It's playing backwards.

31:29.059 --> 31:30.336
Murder-suicide.

31:30.371 --> 31:33.270
Suicide, suicide.

31:34.444 --> 31:35.894
The
body of a woman inside.

31:35.928 --> 31:39.587
Double murder-suicide.

31:52.807 --> 31:54.153
Why would
she give us that?

31:54.188 --> 31:56.500
I'm going to say something
when she gets back.

31:56.535 --> 31:58.813
I mean, that was the weirdest
thing I've ever seen.

31:58.847 --> 32:00.090
Mm-hm.

32:00.125 --> 32:01.747
I mean, it just totally
ruined everything.

32:01.781 --> 32:02.437
Totally.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.511
It seems like
such a sick joke.

32:47.551 --> 32:51.072
What do we do when we are
overwhelmed by evil thoughts?

32:51.107 --> 32:52.418
Where do they come from?

32:52.453 --> 32:54.800
And, more importantly,
how do they influence

32:54.834 --> 32:57.044
our emotions and our actions?

34:21.783 --> 34:23.199
In my
research, people

34:23.233 --> 34:26.443
have described the most
violence and horrific thoughts

34:26.478 --> 34:27.893
that they had.

34:27.927 --> 34:32.242
But what is more frightening is
the sources of these ideations.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.528
Angel of death?

35:41.553 --> 35:43.451
"Wine used as
initiation ritual."

35:50.631 --> 35:51.321
Angel Wilson.

35:56.326 --> 35:57.016
That's great.

35:57.051 --> 35:58.501
Turn around.

35:58.535 --> 35:59.950
Aw, Angel.

36:02.850 --> 36:03.506
What?

36:11.617 --> 36:12.273
Wow.

36:15.449 --> 36:16.760
This has got to be the place.

36:37.436 --> 36:38.126
Found it.

36:46.273 --> 36:48.654
What is this?

36:48.689 --> 36:50.794
"By feeding these souls
of light to the portal,

36:50.829 --> 36:54.142
the gatekeeper will
be granted immortality

36:54.177 --> 36:57.422
to fulfill their infinite
bondage to darkness?"

37:04.222 --> 37:07.017
"Believing what you fear
will bring to the victim

37:07.052 --> 37:09.261
what they are afraid of."

37:55.514 --> 37:59.069
"Once the ritual of la
uva, the grape, is completed,

37:59.104 --> 38:00.899
the collecting of
souls may begin."

39:18.666 --> 39:20.599
You OK?

39:20.634 --> 39:22.325
Yeah.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.120
You left the kettle on.

39:24.154 --> 39:25.604
I was making tea.

39:25.639 --> 39:27.641
OK.

39:27.675 --> 39:31.541
Hey, you guys got
to see this right now.

39:45.313 --> 39:46.694
Public health officials

39:46.729 --> 39:49.835
announced that a mysterious
airborne contagion has

39:49.870 --> 39:52.597
been identified as
the next major health

39:52.631 --> 39:54.668
crisis in global society.

39:54.702 --> 39:57.947
Its origin is unknown and
is spreading at a rate

39:57.981 --> 39:59.638
like we've never seen.

39:59.673 --> 40:01.951
Minutes ago, Washington
has confirmed

40:01.985 --> 40:04.885
that multiple infections
of this deadly disease

40:04.919 --> 40:07.784
have been confirmed in both
the East and West Coast.

40:09.199 --> 40:12.479
The CDC warns
Americans take it serious.

40:12.513 --> 40:16.344
The director of the CDC
has warned all Americans

40:16.379 --> 40:17.794
to prepare for the worst.

40:17.829 --> 40:20.763
Whatever you do,
do not go outside.

40:22.558 --> 40:24.974
Secure all windows and doors.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.562
Fear it.

40:26.596 --> 40:30.807
The air is contaminated Droplets
can spread within seconds.

40:30.842 --> 40:34.259
This airborne virus can
cause death within hours.

40:34.293 --> 40:35.709
Fuck.

40:35.743 --> 40:37.124
Make sure
that you are cautious--

40:37.158 --> 40:39.575
We're basically trapped
in this lodge indefinitely.

40:39.609 --> 40:42.232
After all these months and
now we can't even go outside?

40:42.267 --> 40:44.096
We can't go outside.

40:44.131 --> 40:47.548
The people you are in
contact with are infected.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.136
It might only be
a couple of days.

40:49.170 --> 40:49.930
How do you know that?

40:49.964 --> 40:50.793
I don't.

40:50.827 --> 40:51.966
I'm just hopeful.

40:52.001 --> 40:52.864
Well, let's get real.

40:52.898 --> 40:53.830
Let's talk about it.

40:53.865 --> 40:55.004
Talk about what?

40:55.038 --> 40:56.971
Who is missing?

40:57.006 --> 40:58.490
What do you mean, Benny?

40:58.525 --> 41:00.043
Why don't you look around
and tell me who's missing?

41:02.356 --> 41:03.253
Oh.

41:03.288 --> 41:04.323
Mike, say something.

41:04.358 --> 41:05.221
Russ, say something.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.118
You guys talk to him.

41:06.153 --> 41:07.188
Lou is sick.

41:07.223 --> 41:08.086
I mean, why are
you doing this?

41:08.120 --> 41:09.259
Doing what?

41:09.294 --> 41:10.951
He told you that
he has allergies.

41:10.985 --> 41:13.678
He is infected, Rom.

41:13.712 --> 41:17.129
Whatever the new
variant is, he has it.

41:17.164 --> 41:19.097
Yeah, he looked,
he looked sick.

41:19.131 --> 41:21.306
Hey, Russ, are you
buying into this bullshit?

41:21.340 --> 41:22.480
I don't know, man.

41:22.514 --> 41:24.378
He told us that
he's got allergies.

41:24.412 --> 41:25.448
Why would he lie to us?

41:25.483 --> 41:27.415
He's our family.

41:27.450 --> 41:28.934
That's why we're here.

41:28.969 --> 41:30.108
No, we're here because you
two brought us in the middle

41:30.142 --> 41:31.592
of fucking nowhere.

41:31.627 --> 41:32.731
No, we were trying to do
something nice for someone.

41:32.766 --> 41:33.801
It was someone's birthday.

41:33.836 --> 41:35.009
No hospital.

41:35.044 --> 41:36.563
Don't turn it around to
something that it wasn't.

41:37.460 --> 41:38.461
Symptoms include
hallucination,

41:38.496 --> 41:40.981
coughing, and dry mouth.

41:41.015 --> 41:44.502
You're
all going to die.

41:44.536 --> 41:46.296
This is probably the safest
place that we could be.

41:46.331 --> 41:47.712
It's the safest place?

41:47.746 --> 41:50.128
No hospital, no pharmacy,
no internet reception?

41:50.162 --> 41:51.060
No fucking people.

41:51.094 --> 41:51.957
No disease.

41:51.992 --> 41:53.131
No virus.

41:53.165 --> 41:54.304
I'm not dying because of
your lack of leadership.

41:57.376 --> 41:58.343
What you wanna do?

41:58.377 --> 41:59.102
It's OK.

41:59.137 --> 41:59.965
You were sick.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.070
Hey, knock it off.

42:01.104 --> 42:02.658
We did not come this
far to watch us fucking

42:02.692 --> 42:05.143
have a mental breakdown.

42:05.177 --> 42:10.251
We need to take a deep breath
and figure out our options.

42:10.286 --> 42:11.011
You saw Lou.

42:11.045 --> 42:11.667
How did he look?

42:14.532 --> 42:17.776
When I saw Lou last
night, he did not look good.

42:17.811 --> 42:20.227
When you talked to
Lou, was he sick or not?

42:20.261 --> 42:23.748
I'm not a doctor, but I
would say that Lou is sick.

42:23.782 --> 42:25.439
I'm sorry to say,
his symptoms are

42:25.473 --> 42:26.682
in line with the new strain.

42:26.716 --> 42:29.167
Guys, the only
sensible thing to do

42:29.201 --> 42:30.893
is to get Lou out of this house.

42:30.927 --> 42:31.790
I agree.

42:31.825 --> 42:32.377
Excuse me.

42:32.411 --> 42:33.378
I agree.

42:33.412 --> 42:34.793
You heard what the CDC said.

42:34.828 --> 42:37.106
There's some crazy
stuff going on outside.

42:37.140 --> 42:38.107
Yeah, I heard what they said.

42:38.141 --> 42:39.522
He's staying here.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.075
And you're going to
decide that for everyone?

42:41.110 --> 42:42.007
You're damn right.

42:42.042 --> 42:42.974
How is that fair?

42:43.008 --> 42:44.044
Maybe you're sick.

42:44.078 --> 42:44.734
How about that, Michael?

42:44.769 --> 42:46.080
Maybe you have to go.

42:46.115 --> 42:46.840
I don't feel sick.

42:48.013 --> 42:49.670
Hey, guys.

42:49.705 --> 42:51.983
Kimmy, what are you doing?

42:52.017 --> 42:54.019
I'm-- I'm leaving.

42:54.054 --> 42:55.400
You can't go now.

42:55.434 --> 42:57.505
Listen, I have
space in the back

42:57.540 --> 42:59.715
if anyone wants to
come and join me.

43:02.407 --> 43:04.374
Fuck.

43:04.409 --> 43:06.929
Have you seen the news?

43:06.963 --> 43:08.724
No mask is going to
protect you from that.

43:08.758 --> 43:10.242
The air is contaminated.

43:10.277 --> 43:12.037
People are dying outside, Kimmy.

43:12.072 --> 43:14.626
My son is at home
with this babysitter.

43:14.661 --> 43:17.491
I can't even get through to her.

43:17.525 --> 43:19.597
I have to be at
home with my son.

43:19.631 --> 43:20.977
They said you
can't go outside.

43:21.012 --> 43:22.254
It's not--

43:22.289 --> 43:25.223
Benny, Benny, people, if
she wants to go, let her go.

43:25.257 --> 43:26.396
She's got a kid at home.

43:26.431 --> 43:28.191
My gosh, she's got
kid at home you

43:28.226 --> 43:29.296
cannot go out there like that.

43:29.330 --> 43:30.400
What choice do I have?

43:30.435 --> 43:31.643
It's not safe.

43:31.678 --> 43:32.230
You don't know what
you're up against.

43:32.264 --> 43:32.989
Just--

43:33.024 --> 43:34.508
That's my son.

43:34.542 --> 43:36.614
And you would do the
exact same thing.

43:39.375 --> 43:40.963
It doesn't make
any fucking sense.

43:40.997 --> 43:41.929
I love you.

43:41.964 --> 43:42.585
I love you all.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.759
Just be safe.

43:50.351 --> 43:51.698
You're just going
to let her go?

43:51.732 --> 43:53.423
Baby, she has a kid, baby.

43:53.458 --> 43:54.701
Come on.

43:54.735 --> 43:56.737
No, we-- we can't
just let her go.

43:56.772 --> 44:01.328
We have to let her go,
B. It's poison out there.

44:01.362 --> 44:03.295
You can't risk it.

44:03.330 --> 44:04.676
All of this is crazy, bro.

44:04.711 --> 44:06.298
How do we know that
we're not infected?

44:06.333 --> 44:09.336
Because we're not sick, Russ.

44:09.370 --> 44:11.165
Because we're fine.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.235
We're fine.

44:12.270 --> 44:13.789
How do you know
that we're fine?

44:13.823 --> 44:16.584
The CDC said the symptoms of
paranoia and hallucination.

44:16.619 --> 44:18.414
I know I am not
the only one that's

44:18.448 --> 44:21.520
seeing things in this lodge.

44:23.902 --> 44:27.216
I've been seeing things too.

44:27.250 --> 44:27.906
What?

44:32.290 --> 44:35.293
What did you see?

44:35.327 --> 44:36.984
It's not important.

44:37.019 --> 44:38.537
Maybe you just
need a little rest.

44:38.572 --> 44:41.713
I saw some shit.

44:41.748 --> 44:45.579
Sorry.

44:45.613 --> 44:50.998
I'm fine.

44:51.033 --> 44:51.792
It's asthma.

44:55.658 --> 44:58.557
It's asthma.

44:58.592 --> 45:01.181
Serena, you know it's asthma.

45:01.215 --> 45:02.630
Serena?

45:02.665 --> 45:03.873
I just-- my inhaler.

45:03.908 --> 45:05.392
Serena, you know it's Bianca.

45:05.426 --> 45:06.738
She's got asthma.

45:06.773 --> 45:07.739
Can you help her out?
All right, yeah, yeah.

45:07.774 --> 45:09.361
This is what we need to do.

45:09.396 --> 45:12.468
You guys get her upstairs, let
her get a little bit of rest.

45:12.502 --> 45:15.643
Guys, we're in this together.

45:15.678 --> 45:18.370
Guys, do not let
this break us apart.

45:18.405 --> 45:19.786
Let's not lose control.

45:23.928 --> 45:26.827
All right, all
right, all right.

45:26.862 --> 45:28.035
You're going to lie back here.

45:28.518 --> 45:29.381
Go on.

45:29.416 --> 45:30.969
Deep breath.

45:35.284 --> 45:37.010
Hope Kimmy makes it.

45:46.778 --> 45:50.230
Bianca, do you
think you're sick?

45:55.614 --> 45:56.305
No.

45:58.617 --> 45:59.273
OK.

46:02.898 --> 46:04.554
Wait, get my bag for me.

46:04.589 --> 46:05.245
Yeah.

46:26.680 --> 46:27.405
You're pregnant.

46:33.998 --> 46:36.241
When did you find out?

46:36.276 --> 46:38.381
Three weeks ago, maybe.

46:38.416 --> 46:40.107
You know, I--

46:40.142 --> 46:41.177
I just knew.

46:42.316 --> 46:45.043
Does Rom know?

46:45.078 --> 46:45.803
No.

46:48.150 --> 46:48.806
OK.

46:51.705 --> 46:54.777
I-- I mean, there's
so much going on.

46:54.812 --> 46:57.400
I haven't found the
right time, I guess.

46:57.435 --> 46:58.746
I don't know.

46:58.781 --> 47:03.821
And then he's just not
here, it feels like.

47:18.836 --> 47:19.975
Hey Lou, how are you doing?

47:24.117 --> 47:26.291
Everybody lost their
minds over this virus.

47:26.326 --> 47:28.673
Think I'm infected, huh?

47:28.707 --> 47:29.467
I'm not dumb.

47:32.021 --> 47:33.712
And Michael coming
up here trying,

47:33.747 --> 47:35.335
trying to figure me out.

47:35.369 --> 47:36.888
He's paranoid.

47:36.923 --> 47:38.407
We're paranoid.

47:38.441 --> 47:40.685
And everybody thinks they're
a doctor all of a sudden.

47:40.719 --> 47:42.825
I think maybe we all have it.

47:42.860 --> 47:47.416
Hey, listen, man, I
told you, on my life,

47:47.450 --> 47:50.384
I quarantined two
weeks before this trip.

47:50.419 --> 47:51.765
It's my allergies, you know?

47:51.799 --> 47:54.009
I already gave y'all
the God's honest truth.

47:54.043 --> 47:56.287
I know you did, Lou.

47:56.321 --> 47:57.771
I would never doubt you.

48:06.228 --> 48:09.748
Looking for a
tarp, tape, anything

48:09.783 --> 48:11.336
we can block windows up with.

48:18.757 --> 48:19.482
Fuck off.

48:22.244 --> 48:24.142
Yo, it's kind of
creepy down here.

48:24.177 --> 48:25.937
Benny, Benny, come on, huh?

48:38.260 --> 48:39.261
Yo, Mike.

48:39.295 --> 48:40.262
What?

48:40.296 --> 48:41.642
Come here.

48:41.677 --> 48:42.989
Looks like something back here.

48:43.023 --> 48:43.921
Hold on, watch out.

49:03.423 --> 49:06.702
We're going to figure
a way out of this.

49:06.736 --> 49:10.671
Yeah, we always do.

49:10.706 --> 49:12.225
Since eighth grade, right?

49:12.259 --> 49:13.329
Yeah.

49:13.364 --> 49:16.091
Listen, well, when
I look in your eyes

49:16.125 --> 49:21.061
and I see the look
in her eyes, I could

49:21.096 --> 49:24.375
tell you found the one, bro.

49:24.409 --> 49:25.410
Don't fuck this up.

49:25.445 --> 49:27.792
You know we came
here for a show, man.

49:27.826 --> 49:30.691
So before this weekend's over,
there better be fireworks.

49:30.726 --> 49:31.865
You understand me?

49:31.899 --> 49:33.591
I'm going to get it done, Lou.

49:33.625 --> 49:35.489
Don't be afraid of commitment.

49:35.524 --> 49:41.875
You don't
want to be like me,

49:41.909 --> 49:48.986
coming home to an empty house
every night, no kids, no woman,

49:49.020 --> 49:52.437
no one to take care of you.

49:52.472 --> 49:53.852
Fear is a choice.

49:53.887 --> 49:55.061
Don't believe in it.

49:58.754 --> 49:59.927
All right?

50:03.000 --> 50:04.311
Now, be out.

50:04.346 --> 50:06.693
I'll be much better
after I get some rest.

50:06.727 --> 50:10.248
Go tell them that.

50:12.043 --> 50:14.080
Yo, Mike, come here?

50:20.672 --> 50:21.846
What you got there?

50:21.880 --> 50:22.674
I don't know.

50:22.709 --> 50:23.744
About to find out.

50:23.779 --> 50:26.368
It's got to be
stuff behind it.

50:43.764 --> 50:44.869
I'm so glad you guys are here.

50:44.903 --> 50:45.594
Me too.

50:50.530 --> 50:51.186
What?

51:02.024 --> 51:06.546
It's probably an
allergic reaction, right?

51:06.580 --> 51:07.271
Not a symptom.

51:14.761 --> 51:17.764
OK, enough about me.

51:17.798 --> 51:19.938
You want me to get you
something for your stomach?

51:19.973 --> 51:20.767
Some tea?

51:20.801 --> 51:21.492
Yeah.

51:42.444 --> 51:43.893
Why is there a bed down here?

51:43.928 --> 51:44.894
It's fucking weird.

51:44.929 --> 51:46.793
It's an old lodge, isn't it?

51:46.827 --> 51:48.174
Lots of shit down here.

51:50.866 --> 51:52.385
There's no windows
here, is there?

51:52.419 --> 51:53.524
No.

51:53.558 --> 51:55.974
So no ventilation to
the rest of the house.

52:04.776 --> 52:05.777
Did you get a hold of Kim yet?

52:05.812 --> 52:07.503
No, I've called.

52:07.538 --> 52:08.297
I've texted.

52:08.332 --> 52:09.885
It just goes to voicemail.

52:09.919 --> 52:11.576
Maybe she doesn't
have reception.

52:11.611 --> 52:12.301
I don't know.

52:58.727 --> 52:59.383
Bianca.

53:03.490 --> 53:04.181
What?

53:08.357 --> 53:09.047
What?

53:16.607 --> 53:18.988
Oh.

53:19.023 --> 53:20.611
What?

53:20.645 --> 53:23.130
My necklace, I must
have dropped it in here.

53:23.165 --> 53:23.959
I just had it.

53:23.993 --> 53:25.132
Have you seen it?

53:25.167 --> 53:26.479
No, no, I don't
think you had it on.

53:26.513 --> 53:28.895
No, I wear my necklace
all the time, Bianca.

53:28.929 --> 53:29.999
Calm down immediately.

53:30.034 --> 53:33.693
No, I literally just had it.

53:33.727 --> 53:35.453
Why are you looking
at me like I'm sick?

53:35.488 --> 53:37.593
It's a rash from an
allergic reaction.

53:37.628 --> 53:38.663
Just calm down.

53:38.698 --> 53:41.494
Just had my necklace
and now it's gone.

53:58.027 --> 53:59.236
Hey, hold this for a second.

54:06.312 --> 54:09.211
Are those empty bottles
of that shitty wine we had?

54:14.665 --> 54:15.113
Yeah, Russ.

54:15.148 --> 54:15.804
Fuck.

54:18.462 --> 54:20.187
What you got down there, Benny?

54:20.222 --> 54:23.984
Looks like some old
chest,..

54:24.019 --> 54:28.023
I don't see
anything good, man.

54:28.057 --> 54:30.197
Russ, Hold up a second.

54:37.204 --> 54:40.518
"Believing what you fear
will bring to the victim

54:40.553 --> 54:43.072
what they are afraid of."

54:43.107 --> 54:43.763
This is it.

54:56.776 --> 54:58.950
Upstairs
room isn't sealed.

54:58.985 --> 55:00.883
Obviously, not waterproof.

55:00.918 --> 55:05.405
Lou, I know he's your
friend, but he is sick.

55:05.440 --> 55:06.406
There's a room down here.

55:06.441 --> 55:07.718
We can easily put him in there.

55:09.961 --> 55:13.137
There's no ventilation
to the rest of the house.

55:13.171 --> 55:17.003
We can get food and
water down to him.

55:17.037 --> 55:17.900
I don't want to get sick.

55:44.893 --> 55:46.412
What is this?

55:46.446 --> 55:49.760
Benny, can I talk
to you real quick?

56:03.152 --> 56:03.843
Hey.

56:10.608 --> 56:11.022
Rom.

56:11.057 --> 56:11.713
What?

56:14.232 --> 56:16.649
I'm sorry.

56:16.683 --> 56:18.582
I'm listening.

56:18.616 --> 56:19.134
Are you?

56:19.168 --> 56:20.929
Yeah, I promise.

56:20.963 --> 56:23.552
Something's wrong.

56:23.587 --> 56:24.242
Listen.

56:24.277 --> 56:25.899
I don't know what it is.

56:25.934 --> 56:27.073
Babe, listen to me.

56:27.107 --> 56:28.246
Last night when
I couldn't sleep,

56:28.281 --> 56:29.455
I ended up running
around the house.

56:29.489 --> 56:30.490
And I ended up in
the basement when

56:30.525 --> 56:32.112
I found these photos and books.

56:32.147 --> 56:34.460
And-- you got to listen to this.

56:34.494 --> 56:36.531
"Seeking those of
light and sourcing

56:36.565 --> 56:41.708
fears from each soul for
fear and faith are the same."

56:41.743 --> 56:43.848
We are trapped.

56:43.883 --> 56:45.436
You hear me?

56:45.471 --> 56:48.301
We're in this weird ass
lodge in this weird ass

56:48.335 --> 56:50.407
town in the middle of nowhere.

56:50.441 --> 56:51.546
We can't go outside.

56:51.580 --> 56:53.133
You guys saw the news.

56:53.168 --> 56:56.551
We have no idea what this mist
will do if we walk into it.

56:56.585 --> 56:59.485
And I'm not trying to
die being a character

56:59.519 --> 57:02.591
in one of Rom's books.

57:02.626 --> 57:07.113
The way we're going to go
down is from the inside out.

57:07.147 --> 57:10.875
And the only person that's
showing symptoms right now

57:10.910 --> 57:12.187
is Lou.

57:12.221 --> 57:13.637
So here's what
we're going to do.

57:13.671 --> 57:16.294
We're going to put Lou
down here in this basement.

57:16.329 --> 57:17.261
Do you hear yourself?

57:17.295 --> 57:18.158
I know.

57:18.193 --> 57:19.297
Lou is my best friend.

57:19.332 --> 57:22.646
I love Lou more
than anybody here.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.545
We need to bring Lou
to this basement.

57:25.580 --> 57:28.410
And we need to lock that
motherfucking door until we

57:28.445 --> 57:29.584
can figure this shit out.

57:29.618 --> 57:31.033
Listen to yourself.

57:31.068 --> 57:33.691
We're going to put him
down here in a basement?

57:33.726 --> 57:35.037
It will only be for one night.

57:35.072 --> 57:37.626
Lou would do the exact
same to us if he had to.

57:37.661 --> 57:39.317
We've got to look
out for the girls

57:39.352 --> 57:41.596
and we've got to look
out for the group.

57:41.630 --> 57:44.668
You mean you got to do
what's best for yourself?

57:47.394 --> 57:48.499
Mike, you with me?

57:52.952 --> 57:53.608
Benny you in?

57:58.336 --> 57:59.372
Benny, look at me.

57:59.406 --> 58:00.546
Are you in?

58:00.580 --> 58:02.893
And what if he
don't want to come?

58:02.927 --> 58:05.999
If it's between him
and us, we're going

58:06.034 --> 58:07.345
to make him come down here.

58:09.831 --> 58:11.384
Let's go.

58:11.418 --> 58:12.074
Come on, Benny.

58:16.596 --> 58:18.080
Look at this place.

58:18.115 --> 58:19.634
Look at these women.

58:19.668 --> 58:25.709
This is the lodge where they
were tortured and killed.

58:25.743 --> 58:27.055
I don't know
what is up with you

58:27.089 --> 58:30.437
in this freaky, crazy
obsession that you have.

58:30.472 --> 58:32.232
But you need to listen to me.

58:32.267 --> 58:33.061
I'm listening.

58:33.095 --> 58:34.925
No, you're not.

58:34.959 --> 58:36.443
I've been trying--

58:36.478 --> 58:38.031
I've been trying to
tell you something

58:38.066 --> 58:40.033
for the last two weeks.

58:40.068 --> 58:41.414
Tell me?

58:41.448 --> 58:42.415
What could you possibly
tell me that I haven't

58:42.449 --> 58:44.003
heard in the past two weeks?

58:48.283 --> 58:49.008
I'm pregnant.

59:01.227 --> 59:02.055
Breathe.

59:02.090 --> 59:02.884
It's going to be OK.

59:02.918 --> 59:03.816
I want to go home.

59:16.207 --> 59:19.348
Lou, Lou.

59:19.383 --> 59:20.177
What's up?

59:20.211 --> 59:21.247
Lou, come with us.

59:22.593 --> 59:24.595
Come with us downstairs.

59:24.630 --> 59:27.978
What you talking about,
come to you downstairs?

59:28.012 --> 59:29.566
Rom needs our help, man.

59:29.600 --> 59:30.670
What do you
mean, he need help.

59:30.705 --> 59:33.017
Rom needs-- Rom needs help.

59:33.052 --> 59:34.329
Rom got hurt, Rom.

59:34.363 --> 59:35.054
Rom from hurt?

59:35.088 --> 59:35.848
For what?

59:35.882 --> 59:36.296
What you have?

59:36.331 --> 59:37.608
How?

59:37.643 --> 59:38.367
He was moving stuff
around in the basement.

59:38.402 --> 59:39.506
He hurt himself.

59:39.541 --> 59:40.404
He needs our help
downstairs now.

59:40.438 --> 59:42.337
Rom needs our help, man.

59:45.202 --> 59:46.721
Oh, can't really be sick.

59:52.347 --> 59:55.108
Right in.

59:55.143 --> 59:56.489
Follow me.

59:56.523 --> 59:58.940
It's all right, just follow me.

59:58.974 --> 1:00:00.010
I got you .

1:00:00.044 --> 1:00:01.321
Bro, I got you.

1:00:01.356 --> 1:00:03.565
He needs you.

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:05.498
How did he get down here?

1:00:05.532 --> 1:00:06.223
He's here.

1:00:06.257 --> 1:00:07.086
He needs you.

1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:10.261
Just come on, man.

1:00:10.296 --> 1:00:10.986
Where you at, bro?

1:00:11.021 --> 1:00:11.918
This way.

1:00:11.953 --> 1:00:12.816
Rom!

1:00:15.577 --> 1:00:16.233
Where he at?

1:00:21.376 --> 1:00:22.066
Go.

1:00:24.448 --> 1:00:25.656
What are you doing?

1:00:25.691 --> 1:00:26.553
What y'all doing?

1:00:30.212 --> 1:00:30.937
You're sick.

1:00:39.049 --> 1:00:41.327
Ah!

1:00:42.155 --> 1:00:44.295
Fuck off me, man.

1:00:47.678 --> 1:00:48.921
This is what
we're doing, Russ?

1:00:59.241 --> 1:01:01.692
Open the door.

1:01:01.727 --> 1:01:03.245
Open this door, Russ!

1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:04.591
I'll be infected.

1:01:04.626 --> 1:01:05.869
His own blood infected me, man.

1:01:05.903 --> 1:01:07.318
I don't wanna fucking die.

1:01:07.353 --> 1:01:08.112
Yo!

1:01:08.147 --> 1:01:08.837
Just making--

1:01:08.872 --> 1:01:09.562
Just get you upstairs.

1:01:09.596 --> 1:01:10.528
Hold on.

1:01:11.598 --> 1:01:12.392
Russ, it's OK.
I'm scared.

1:01:12.427 --> 1:01:13.290
I don't wanna die.

1:01:13.324 --> 1:01:13.911
Let's get you upstairs.

1:01:13.946 --> 1:01:14.498
Please.

1:01:14.532 --> 1:01:15.119
Goddamn, man.

1:01:15.154 --> 1:01:16.258
Please.

1:01:16.293 --> 1:01:17.674
I don't wanna fucking
die like this, man.

1:01:19.537 --> 1:01:22.161
I know you ain't going
to leave me in here.

1:01:23.127 --> 1:01:24.128
All right, sit down.

1:01:24.163 --> 1:01:24.991
Ready?

1:01:25.026 --> 1:01:26.199
We need to stop the bleeding.

1:01:26.234 --> 1:01:27.407
And we need to clean him up.

1:01:27.442 --> 1:01:28.512
I'll get something
to clean it maybe

1:01:28.546 --> 1:01:31.515
and something to
put on the wound.

1:01:31.549 --> 1:01:32.481
This side, this side.

1:01:35.761 --> 1:01:36.658
Put the towel.

1:01:36.693 --> 1:01:37.624
Put the towel.

1:01:37.659 --> 1:01:39.143
Russ, put pressure on it!

1:01:39.765 --> 1:01:41.283
Aw, shit, man.

1:01:41.318 --> 1:01:43.976
What the hell is happening?

1:01:44.010 --> 1:01:44.562
Get out.

1:01:44.597 --> 1:01:46.081
No, no, no, no.

1:01:46.116 --> 1:01:47.427
Get out!

1:01:47.462 --> 1:01:48.394
Babe.

1:01:48.428 --> 1:01:51.190
What happened?

1:01:51.224 --> 1:01:51.915
Babe, I'm sorry.

1:01:54.745 --> 1:01:57.368
Keep pressure on it.

1:01:57.403 --> 1:01:58.404
We just tried to put--

1:01:58.438 --> 1:01:59.681
OK, here.

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:00.682
-Lou into the basement
real quick so that

1:02:00.717 --> 1:02:02.166
he wouldn't get us all sick.

1:02:02.201 --> 1:02:03.340
Basement?

1:02:03.374 --> 1:02:04.513
We just didn't want him
to get everybody sick.

1:02:04.548 --> 1:02:06.239
You understand that, right?

1:02:06.274 --> 1:02:07.309
It just went down.

1:02:07.344 --> 1:02:08.241
This is going to hurt.

1:02:08.276 --> 1:02:09.104
This is going to hurt.

1:02:12.245 --> 1:02:13.143
Ah.

1:02:13.177 --> 1:02:14.144
What were you thinking?

1:02:16.491 --> 1:02:17.803
Keep it covered.

1:02:17.837 --> 1:02:20.667
No, you can't touch me.

1:02:20.702 --> 1:02:22.117
Baby, I'm not going anywhere.

1:02:22.152 --> 1:02:25.155
Baby, hold on, back
away from me right now.

1:02:26.121 --> 1:02:27.329
Open this!

1:02:54.667 --> 1:02:55.806
Open this door!

1:02:58.878 --> 1:03:00.259
I'm not leaving you.

1:03:00.293 --> 1:03:03.365
Babe, getting you sick
would be worse than dying.

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:05.160
OK?

1:03:05.195 --> 1:03:05.747
Baby, please.

1:03:05.782 --> 1:03:07.266
I can't go.

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:10.165
Go lay down in
that bed right there.

1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:11.477
I don't wanna.

1:03:11.511 --> 1:03:15.930
Tomorrow morning, as long
as I don't have no symptoms,

1:03:15.964 --> 1:03:17.932
we'll get in the car,
one way or the other,

1:03:17.966 --> 1:03:20.210
and we're going to get
the fuck out of here.

1:03:20.244 --> 1:03:21.832
You hear me?

1:03:21.867 --> 1:03:23.627
Do you trust me?

1:03:23.661 --> 1:03:25.629
I love you.

1:03:25.663 --> 1:03:26.941
I love you.

1:03:26.975 --> 1:03:27.700
Now go.

1:03:32.049 --> 1:03:33.706
Meg!

1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:35.570
Wait.

1:03:35.604 --> 1:03:37.710
What happened?

1:03:37.744 --> 1:03:39.125
I'm sorry, man.

1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:41.058
We just-- I don't know
what happened to me, bro.

1:03:41.093 --> 1:03:41.818
Fuck.

1:03:46.443 --> 1:03:47.927
You know I love Lou, right?

1:03:53.277 --> 1:03:54.209
I'm sorry.

1:04:03.184 --> 1:04:04.910
You know I would
never try to hurt him.

1:04:04.944 --> 1:04:07.602
We just-- we just didn't want
him to get everybody sick.

1:04:07.636 --> 1:04:10.363
Between this lodge
and the virus, man.

1:04:10.398 --> 1:04:12.055
I'm going fucking crazy.

1:04:12.089 --> 1:04:13.608
Bro, you don't understand, man.

1:04:13.642 --> 1:04:16.783
Something got into me.

1:04:16.818 --> 1:04:18.130
You believe me, right?

1:04:18.164 --> 1:04:19.476
You know I would never
do that to him, right?

1:04:22.410 --> 1:04:24.481
I know.

1:04:24.515 --> 1:04:25.585
I'm going to go downstairs.

1:04:25.620 --> 1:04:27.518
And I'm going to get Lou.

1:04:27.553 --> 1:04:28.519
And I'll be back.

1:04:28.554 --> 1:04:29.693
Tell Lou I'm sorry, man.

1:04:29.727 --> 1:04:30.659
I'll be back.

1:04:30.694 --> 1:04:33.352
Get Lou out of there, man.

1:04:38.391 --> 1:04:39.876
Russ does not look good.

1:04:45.571 --> 1:04:47.469
We've got to
get him some help.

1:04:47.504 --> 1:04:49.023
There's got to be a
landline here somewhere.

1:04:49.057 --> 1:04:50.231
I'm going to go
down to the front.

1:04:50.265 --> 1:04:51.888
I'm going to get a
hold of the cops.

1:04:51.922 --> 1:04:54.131
We can't stay here like this.

1:04:54.166 --> 1:04:56.237
Get Lou out of that basement.

1:04:56.271 --> 1:04:56.927
OK.

1:04:59.757 --> 1:05:00.413
OK.

1:05:19.191 --> 1:05:20.088
How is Russ?

1:05:20.123 --> 1:05:21.572
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1:05:21.607 --> 1:05:22.849
What was I thinking?

1:05:22.884 --> 1:05:25.059
I'm thinking, shit, Lou is sick.

1:05:25.093 --> 1:05:27.061
We should put him where he
can't get other people sick.

1:05:27.095 --> 1:05:28.476
That's what I'm thinking.

1:05:28.510 --> 1:05:29.960
No, Michael, you were only
thinking about yourself.

1:05:29.995 --> 1:05:32.273
Now show me where you put him.

1:05:32.307 --> 1:05:32.998
Now!

1:05:54.881 --> 1:05:56.055
What the fuck?

1:06:00.818 --> 1:06:01.785
What?

1:06:01.819 --> 1:06:03.269
Somebody in here?

1:06:03.304 --> 1:06:06.307
They don't trust you.

1:06:06.341 --> 1:06:07.032
Sick.

1:06:11.139 --> 1:06:12.485
You may as well come out now.

1:06:12.520 --> 1:06:13.900
You're sick.

1:06:13.935 --> 1:06:15.454
What's that?

1:06:15.488 --> 1:06:16.489
What the--

1:06:19.665 --> 1:06:21.805
They said you're sick.

1:06:21.839 --> 1:06:22.806
They say you're sick.

1:06:22.840 --> 1:06:25.395
They don't trust you.

1:06:25.429 --> 1:06:26.706
They don't trust you.

1:06:26.741 --> 1:06:31.539
They don't trust you.

1:06:31.573 --> 1:06:34.887
They say you're sick.

1:06:36.406 --> 1:06:39.443
They don't believe you.

1:06:59.291 --> 1:07:01.672
Ugh.

1:07:01.707 --> 1:07:03.674
Ah!

1:07:03.709 --> 1:07:05.642
Ugh!

1:07:05.676 --> 1:07:07.609
Ugh!

1:07:07.644 --> 1:07:09.508
Ah!

1:07:09.542 --> 1:07:10.198
No!

1:07:35.810 --> 1:07:37.881
We are experiencing
technical difficulties

1:07:37.915 --> 1:07:39.365
at this time.

1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:41.643
Please leave a message and
we will return your call--

1:07:44.922 --> 1:07:46.683
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1:07:46.717 --> 1:07:47.960
He's going to be pissed off.

1:07:47.994 --> 1:07:49.444
Just make sure he
doesn't fucking hit me.

1:08:01.801 --> 1:08:02.664
Why would he do that?

1:08:10.879 --> 1:08:12.226
What the hell is this?

1:08:14.849 --> 1:08:16.161
What language is that?

1:08:30.899 --> 1:08:32.108
Oh, my god!

1:08:37.872 --> 1:08:40.806
What is this?

1:09:20.259 --> 1:09:22.848
No one's been here
for eight years?

1:09:34.791 --> 1:09:35.930
She's scared.

1:09:35.964 --> 1:09:38.553
We should have
been done already.

1:09:38.588 --> 1:09:39.382
We all did it.

1:09:42.178 --> 1:09:45.664
Got to do it.

1:09:45.698 --> 1:09:46.354
Do it.

1:10:06.650 --> 1:10:07.341
Sh.

1:10:11.345 --> 1:10:14.106
Ah!

1:10:16.004 --> 1:10:17.903
She looks like she's dying.

1:10:17.937 --> 1:10:18.869
You look like you're dying.

1:10:19.905 --> 1:10:23.149
You look like you're dying.

1:10:26.049 --> 1:10:26.705
Ah!

1:10:42.893 --> 1:10:46.276
Why would he fucking do that?

1:10:46.311 --> 1:10:48.968
Why would he fucking do that?

1:10:49.003 --> 1:10:50.763
Why would he fucking do that!

1:10:50.798 --> 1:10:51.799
Hey, Michael?

1:10:51.833 --> 1:10:52.938
What did he fucking do that?

1:10:52.972 --> 1:10:53.973
It wasn't him.

1:10:54.008 --> 1:10:55.078
Why would he fucking do that?

1:10:55.112 --> 1:10:56.562
It wasn't him!

1:10:56.597 --> 1:10:57.322
Michael, we--

1:10:57.356 --> 1:10:58.530
This is my fucking fault.

1:10:58.564 --> 1:11:00.221
We've all lost
something, Mike.

1:11:10.818 --> 1:11:11.508
Rom?

1:11:33.496 --> 1:11:34.082
Ah!

1:11:34.876 --> 1:11:35.601
No, no, it's OK.

1:11:35.636 --> 1:11:36.084
It's me.

1:11:36.119 --> 1:11:36.844
It's me.

1:11:36.878 --> 1:11:37.741
You're OK.

1:11:37.776 --> 1:11:38.708
You're OK.

1:11:38.742 --> 1:11:40.054
You're OK.

1:11:40.088 --> 1:11:41.124
We got to go.

1:11:41.158 --> 1:11:42.159
We've got to get
out of here, OK?

1:11:42.194 --> 1:11:43.644
Come on.

1:11:43.678 --> 1:11:44.955
We're going to get your
medicine and get out of here.

1:11:44.990 --> 1:11:45.680
Let's go.

1:11:45.715 --> 1:11:46.578
We have to go.

1:11:46.612 --> 1:11:47.475
We got to go.

1:11:47.510 --> 1:11:51.030
I'm going to get the others.

1:12:01.938 --> 1:12:02.594
Ah!

1:12:15.054 --> 1:12:17.954
Mike!

1:12:17.988 --> 1:12:19.921
Mike!

1:12:19.956 --> 1:12:22.268
Mike!

1:12:26.307 --> 1:12:26.928
A warning sign.

1:12:29.724 --> 1:12:30.276
Russ?

1:12:38.699 --> 1:12:39.251
Russ?

1:12:55.371 --> 1:12:56.717
Yet I wonder--

1:13:10.972 --> 1:13:11.732
Russ?

1:13:46.870 --> 1:13:47.561
Russ?

1:13:57.709 --> 1:14:01.333
Mike, can you see her?

1:14:03.508 --> 1:14:04.509
Oh, god.

1:14:07.304 --> 1:14:08.478
She's there.

1:14:11.274 --> 1:14:12.448
Oh, god!

1:14:30.051 --> 1:14:30.707
Ah!

1:14:33.917 --> 1:14:40.717
Oy, oy, no, no,
no, no, ah, ah, ah.

1:14:49.070 --> 1:14:51.348
Ah!

1:14:51.383 --> 1:14:52.211
Help!

1:14:52.246 --> 1:14:53.143
Get me out of here!

1:14:53.178 --> 1:14:54.766
Ah!

1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:49.890
No, no.

1:15:49.924 --> 1:15:52.064
Let me out!

1:15:52.099 --> 1:15:53.825
Let me out!

1:15:53.859 --> 1:15:55.896
Let me out!

1:15:55.930 --> 1:15:57.863
Let me out!

1:15:57.898 --> 1:15:58.830
Let me out!

1:15:58.864 --> 1:15:59.934
Let me out!

1:15:59.969 --> 1:16:01.039
Let me out!

1:16:01.073 --> 1:16:01.833
Let me out!

1:16:01.867 --> 1:16:03.179
Let me out!

1:16:03.213 --> 1:16:04.180
Let me out!

1:16:42.736 --> 1:16:53.885
What is going on?

1:16:57.509 --> 1:16:58.165
Babe?

1:17:00.823 --> 1:17:02.031
Serena?

1:17:05.759 --> 1:17:06.760
Shut up!

1:17:06.794 --> 1:17:07.933
Show me your hands.

1:17:07.968 --> 1:17:09.970
I want to see your
hands right now.

1:17:44.521 --> 1:17:46.144
You're OK.

1:17:46.178 --> 1:17:47.317
Small breaths, come on.

1:17:47.352 --> 1:17:48.422
Sit down.

1:17:49.354 --> 1:17:50.010
Sit down.

1:17:57.362 --> 1:17:59.605
It's not the virus.

1:17:59.640 --> 1:18:01.780
It's the lodge.

1:18:01.815 --> 1:18:04.231
Las brujas del miedo.

1:18:04.265 --> 1:18:05.404
What?

1:18:05.439 --> 1:18:07.683
It means the
witches of fear.

1:18:07.717 --> 1:18:13.827
And they're using
our fear to kill us.

1:18:13.861 --> 1:18:15.794
We got to get out of here now.

1:18:15.829 --> 1:18:16.968
I can't go out there.

1:18:17.002 --> 1:18:17.865
I'm so scared.

1:18:20.385 --> 1:18:21.524
We have to leave now.

1:18:21.558 --> 1:18:22.939
Yeah, you're OK.

1:18:22.974 --> 1:18:23.975
No, no, no, no, I've been
seeing things out there.

1:18:24.009 --> 1:18:25.183
I don't want to go out there.

1:18:25.217 --> 1:18:26.046
I don't want to do it.

1:18:27.323 --> 1:18:28.531
OK.

1:18:28.565 --> 1:18:29.359
Everyone's dead.

1:18:29.394 --> 1:18:30.636
What?

1:18:30.671 --> 1:18:32.466
Everyone-- Michael,
Meg, Russ, all dead.

1:18:32.500 --> 1:18:34.157
Everyone is dead.

1:18:34.192 --> 1:18:35.227
Everyone is dead.

1:18:35.262 --> 1:18:36.332
There's something--
there's something

1:18:36.366 --> 1:18:37.436
going on in this lodge.

1:18:37.471 --> 1:18:39.197
I see the pictures of us, right?

1:18:39.231 --> 1:18:41.440
All, all the pictures are
blurred except for who's

1:18:41.475 --> 1:18:42.372
in this room right now.

1:18:42.407 --> 1:18:43.477
I see Meg's picture.

1:18:43.511 --> 1:18:44.409
Her face is blurred.

1:18:44.443 --> 1:18:45.341
I go find Meg.

1:18:45.375 --> 1:18:47.308
She's dead, OK?

1:18:47.343 --> 1:18:49.586
I'm seeing the words.

1:18:49.621 --> 1:18:52.106
I see, "no light Tamara."

1:18:52.141 --> 1:18:55.109
At the bottom of the
painting, the numbers 4-1-9.

1:18:55.144 --> 1:18:57.663
What does that mean?

1:18:57.698 --> 1:19:01.495
Nolite, nolite, timere.

1:19:01.529 --> 1:19:03.221
Nolite timere, it's Latin.

1:19:03.255 --> 1:19:04.360
Nolite timere.

1:19:04.394 --> 1:19:07.570
It means, don't be afraid.

1:19:07.604 --> 1:19:10.159
OK, yes, OK, so, so,
what is it for 4-1-9?

1:19:10.193 --> 1:19:12.609
Is the 4-1-9 code
for do not be afraid?

1:19:12.644 --> 1:19:14.266
What does the 4-1-9 mean?

1:19:14.301 --> 1:19:15.336
It's a scripture.

1:19:15.371 --> 1:19:16.096
What is-- a scripture of what?

1:19:16.130 --> 1:19:17.235
Scripture?

1:19:17.269 --> 1:19:21.377
4-1-9, 4-1-9, 4-1-9,
4-1-9, I've seen that.

1:19:21.411 --> 1:19:23.586
I've seen that number too.

1:19:23.620 --> 1:19:26.589
Last night, when I told you
that story about the witches

1:19:26.623 --> 1:19:28.246
and the miners and the lodge--

1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:29.557
The witches?

1:19:29.592 --> 1:19:30.731
-where they were
brought to be tortured.

1:19:35.598 --> 1:19:37.462
That's here.

1:19:37.496 --> 1:19:41.949
This is the lodge.

1:19:41.984 --> 1:19:44.469
What the fuck are
you talking about, Rom?

1:19:44.503 --> 1:19:45.815
There are places
all over the world

1:19:45.850 --> 1:19:47.713
that are portals for evil.

1:19:47.748 --> 1:19:49.094
What are you talking about?

1:19:49.129 --> 1:19:50.337
What does that have
anything to do with what's

1:19:50.371 --> 1:19:51.303
happening right now?

1:19:51.338 --> 1:19:52.995
I'm trying to tell you.

1:19:53.029 --> 1:19:54.824
Each one of these
portals has what

1:19:54.859 --> 1:19:56.481
is called a
gatekeeper whose only

1:19:56.515 --> 1:20:02.487
purpose is to feed the
portal souls, souls like us.

1:20:02.521 --> 1:20:05.870
And they consume our souls to
give themselves eternal life

1:20:05.904 --> 1:20:07.768
and to keep the portal alive.

1:20:07.803 --> 1:20:09.908
The witches I told
you about last night?

1:20:09.943 --> 1:20:12.704
They live in these portals.

1:20:12.738 --> 1:20:14.119
Las brujas del miedo.

1:20:14.154 --> 1:20:15.465
What?

1:20:15.500 --> 1:20:19.124
It means the witches of fear.

1:20:19.159 --> 1:20:22.196
You've lost your fucking mind.

1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:30.826
The woman that was downstairs
that checked us in,

1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:33.380
she's like a gatekeeper?

1:20:33.414 --> 1:20:34.726
Yes.

1:20:34.760 --> 1:20:36.210
Did you know this before
you brought us here?

1:20:36.245 --> 1:20:37.798
I thought it was
just a story, Serena.

1:20:37.833 --> 1:20:38.730
You thought it was just--

1:20:38.764 --> 1:20:40.766
I didn't know.

1:20:40.801 --> 1:20:42.561
I was just trying
to research my book.

1:20:42.596 --> 1:20:43.839
Why would you bring us here?

1:20:43.873 --> 1:20:45.392
I didn't know.

1:20:45.426 --> 1:20:47.704
But what I do know is that
they are feeding on our fear.

1:20:47.739 --> 1:20:49.258
And everything
that we are seeing,

1:20:49.292 --> 1:20:54.919
everything that we are feeling,
I don't believe it's real.

1:20:54.953 --> 1:20:58.370
So everything we're
seeing isn't real?

1:20:58.405 --> 1:20:59.785
It is if you believe it.

1:20:59.820 --> 1:21:02.685
And if you believe
it, it will kill you.

1:21:02.719 --> 1:21:03.720
Babe, what are you doing?

1:21:03.755 --> 1:21:04.687
We have to get out of here now.

1:21:04.721 --> 1:21:05.653
Just give me a minute, OK?

1:21:05.688 --> 1:21:06.413
Give me a second.

1:21:06.447 --> 1:21:09.243
This is on you.

1:21:09.278 --> 1:21:11.694
Our friends are dead
because of you, Rom.

1:21:11.728 --> 1:21:12.764
I'm sorry.

1:21:12.798 --> 1:21:14.766
Isaiah chapter 41 verse 9.

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:16.733
I have taken you to
the ends of the Earth.

1:21:16.768 --> 1:21:21.635
From the farthest
corners, I called you

1:21:21.669 --> 1:21:22.843
and not rejected you.

1:21:22.878 --> 1:21:24.914
So fear not, for I am with you.

1:21:24.949 --> 1:21:27.468
But I have chosen me
and not cast thee away.

1:21:27.503 --> 1:21:28.538
You guys--

1:21:28.573 --> 1:21:29.539
We've got to get out of here.

1:21:29.574 --> 1:21:30.299
Come on.

1:21:35.511 --> 1:21:36.408
Ah!

1:21:57.671 --> 1:21:58.603
I think it's over.

1:21:59.535 --> 1:22:00.191
Ah!

1:22:04.057 --> 1:22:05.541
Benny, it's OK.

1:22:05.575 --> 1:22:08.475
It's not real.

1:22:08.509 --> 1:22:09.303
What's that?

1:22:12.479 --> 1:22:13.376
It's real.

1:22:13.411 --> 1:22:15.344
It's not real.

1:22:15.378 --> 1:22:17.001
We're manifesting fear.

1:22:17.035 --> 1:22:18.795
We have to take a
chance and go outside.

1:22:18.830 --> 1:22:20.970
The disease
is way more severe than anyone

1:22:21.005 --> 1:22:22.144
could have actually imagined.

1:22:22.178 --> 1:22:22.627
Oh my god.

1:22:22.661 --> 1:22:23.662
Let's go.

1:22:23.697 --> 1:22:24.491
I cried out.

1:22:24.525 --> 1:22:25.906
And no one heard me.

1:22:25.941 --> 1:22:27.321
And I was trying to get help.

1:23:04.565 --> 1:23:05.497
It's OK.

1:23:05.532 --> 1:23:07.499
You're OK.

1:23:07.534 --> 1:23:08.535
You're OK.

1:23:13.574 --> 1:23:14.334
We've got to go.

1:23:26.449 --> 1:23:28.348
We got to take
our chances outside.

1:23:28.382 --> 1:23:29.038
Come on.

1:23:29.073 --> 1:23:29.797
We just got to run.

1:23:29.832 --> 1:23:31.592
Sh.

1:23:31.627 --> 1:23:33.353
Put this on.

1:23:33.387 --> 1:23:35.251
Don't breathe until
we get to the car.

1:23:37.253 --> 1:23:38.599
Ah!

1:23:42.465 --> 1:23:43.156
Ah!

1:23:51.819 --> 1:23:54.408
We have to go get her.

1:23:54.443 --> 1:23:55.444
Hell no.

1:24:03.797 --> 1:24:04.625
You're crazy.

1:24:04.660 --> 1:24:06.420
Don't go down there.

1:24:06.455 --> 1:24:06.869
What y'all doing?

1:24:06.903 --> 1:24:07.594
Stop!

1:24:23.230 --> 1:24:23.679
Serena?

1:24:29.409 --> 1:24:30.099
Serena?

1:25:01.372 --> 1:25:02.062
Serena.

1:25:05.652 --> 1:25:06.687
What's up, man?

1:25:06.722 --> 1:25:08.068
Step out of the car.

1:25:08.103 --> 1:25:09.552
You know I ain't do nothing.

1:25:09.587 --> 1:25:11.209
You ain't got to shine
the light in my face.

1:25:11.244 --> 1:25:12.486
I didn't do nothing.

1:25:12.521 --> 1:25:14.178
I said, get
out of the car now.

1:25:14.212 --> 1:25:15.213
What ya'll doing, man?

1:25:15.248 --> 1:25:16.145
I said I ain't doing nothing.

1:25:16.180 --> 1:25:17.112
I'm just driving home.

1:25:17.146 --> 1:25:19.804
Man, I ain't do nothing.

1:25:19.838 --> 1:25:20.494
Serena.

1:25:26.949 --> 1:25:27.639
Oh, god.

1:25:32.679 --> 1:25:33.335
Ah!

1:25:37.615 --> 1:25:38.857
Serena?

1:25:38.892 --> 1:25:40.135
No, no.

1:25:43.759 --> 1:25:46.244
Serena, what's happening?

1:25:51.732 --> 1:25:53.078
We've got to go!

1:25:53.113 --> 1:25:58.670
Serena, Serena, Serena,
whatever you're seeing,

1:25:58.705 --> 1:26:00.016
it's inside your head.

1:26:04.849 --> 1:26:05.505
Help!

1:26:10.234 --> 1:26:11.476
It's not real.

1:26:11.511 --> 1:26:12.581
Serena!

1:26:12.615 --> 1:26:13.513
Don't believe it.

1:26:17.862 --> 1:26:18.794
Help!

1:26:24.662 --> 1:26:27.596
Help!

1:26:27.630 --> 1:26:29.701
Serena, we're here.

1:26:29.736 --> 1:26:30.599
Come to us.

1:26:36.846 --> 1:26:38.193
We're here.

1:26:47.029 --> 1:26:50.584
Ah!

1:26:50.619 --> 1:26:51.309
Ah!

1:26:51.344 --> 1:26:52.655
Ah!

1:26:57.902 --> 1:26:58.558
Benny!

1:26:58.592 --> 1:26:59.248
Benny!

1:27:06.945 --> 1:27:08.913
What-- what?

1:27:12.537 --> 1:27:14.643
Oh, my god.

1:27:14.677 --> 1:27:16.127
Benny.

1:27:16.161 --> 1:27:18.543
Baby, keep going.

1:27:18.578 --> 1:27:19.958
We've got to go.

1:27:19.993 --> 1:27:21.581
I told you I
didn't do nothing!

1:27:26.068 --> 1:27:28.484
I'm sorry.

1:27:28.519 --> 1:27:30.797
I'm s--

1:27:30.831 --> 1:27:32.177
We need to get out.

1:27:32.212 --> 1:27:34.456
Let's go.

1:27:34.490 --> 1:27:35.802
I'm sorry.

1:27:35.836 --> 1:27:38.149
Benny, what did you do?

1:27:38.183 --> 1:27:41.048
I had to.

1:27:51.887 --> 1:27:53.233
Don't do it, Benny.

1:27:53.268 --> 1:27:54.648
Benny, no!

1:27:56.029 --> 1:27:57.962
Ah!

1:27:57.996 --> 1:27:59.515
Ah!

1:27:59.550 --> 1:28:01.517
Ah!

1:28:06.281 --> 1:28:07.661
I can't feel my legs.

1:28:11.700 --> 1:28:12.666
We have to go.

1:28:12.701 --> 1:28:13.840
We have to go.

1:28:28.095 --> 1:28:29.856
Bianca, I'm sorry.

1:28:32.790 --> 1:28:34.481
You know you can't
beat it physically.

1:28:37.070 --> 1:28:38.727
You have to beat it mentally.

1:28:43.939 --> 1:28:45.906
You can beat this thing.

1:28:45.941 --> 1:28:47.874
Don't lose your faith.

1:28:47.908 --> 1:28:49.047
I love you.

1:28:49.082 --> 1:28:50.635
Now go.

1:29:01.612 --> 1:29:03.959
Ah!

1:29:51.282 --> 1:29:53.940
Bianca, it's not real.

1:30:08.679 --> 1:30:09.127
Oh!

1:30:09.162 --> 1:30:10.163
Oh!

1:30:19.103 --> 1:30:22.071
Ah!

1:31:10.913 --> 1:31:12.984
Come on, you can do it.

1:31:13.019 --> 1:31:15.711
Use your faith.

1:31:17.437 --> 1:31:19.543
It's taken you to
the ends of the Earth

1:31:19.577 --> 1:31:23.236
from the farthest corners
and I've called you.

1:31:23.270 --> 1:31:25.652
I will strengthen
you and help you.

1:31:25.687 --> 1:31:28.137
I called you and
not rejected you.

1:31:28.172 --> 1:31:31.727
So fear not, for I am with you.

1:31:35.144 --> 1:31:36.111
Do not be dismayed.

1:31:40.564 --> 1:31:41.875
For I am your god!

1:31:43.325 --> 1:31:46.570
And hold,
my richest hand.

1:31:46.604 --> 1:31:47.812
Praying with you.

1:31:47.847 --> 1:31:50.056
Do not be deceived,
for am I you god.

1:31:55.164 --> 1:32:05.658
For I am with you.

1:33:47.483 --> 1:33:49.554
Oh, that shit is on.

1:33:49.589 --> 1:33:53.041
Let me drop some
shit like this here.

1:33:53.075 --> 1:33:54.283
At night, I can't sleep.

1:33:54.318 --> 1:33:55.837
I toss and turn.

1:33:55.871 --> 1:33:58.529
Candlesticks in the dark,
visions of bodies being burned.

1:33:58.563 --> 1:34:00.393
Four walls just
staring at a nigga.

1:34:00.427 --> 1:34:03.707
I'm paranoid sleeping with
my finger on the trigger.

1:34:03.741 --> 1:34:05.122
On the scene there,

1:34:05.156 --> 1:34:08.746
another terrible story
today as WRLA's Brian Mann

1:34:08.781 --> 1:34:11.300
brings us the
latest on who died.

1:34:11.335 --> 1:34:13.095
Polive have spent hours--

1:34:13.130 --> 1:34:18.169
Police have spent hours
of Sunday investigating--

1:34:23.554 --> 1:34:24.520
Let me out!

1:34:24.555 --> 1:34:25.349
Let me out!

1:34:25.383 --> 1:34:28.939
Let me out!

1:34:48.544 --> 1:34:49.614
Fear.

1:34:49.649 --> 1:34:50.650
Fear exists in the mind.

1:34:50.685 --> 1:34:51.927
Everybody afraid of something.

1:34:51.962 --> 1:34:53.239
Everybody got religions
of their own kind.

1:34:53.273 --> 1:34:54.723
Everybody prayed for something.

1:34:54.758 --> 1:34:56.207
And I got to hold it down
for me and mine out here.

1:34:56.242 --> 1:34:57.657
I can't play with nothing
but stay with your scary ass

1:34:57.692 --> 1:34:59.107
in the house.
Think better thoughts.

1:34:59.141 --> 1:35:00.522
If you need to save your
buddies, just whip it, man.

1:35:00.556 --> 1:35:01.488
Somebody pinch me.

1:35:01.523 --> 1:35:02.697
I had a dream.

1:35:02.731 --> 1:35:03.939
I had a dream.
Everything played out.

1:35:03.974 --> 1:35:04.768
And my real life was
something I seen.

1:35:04.802 --> 1:35:06.183
Something I seen.

1:35:06.217 --> 1:35:07.218
I'm just trying to get
all that out my thoughts,

1:35:07.253 --> 1:35:08.012
but it won't leave.

1:35:08.047 --> 1:35:09.220
Somebody scream.

1:35:09.255 --> 1:35:10.256
I'm the only one right
now that's in this house,

1:35:10.290 --> 1:35:11.119
but I hear screams.

1:35:11.153 --> 1:35:11.947
This is real life.

1:35:11.982 --> 1:35:13.155
No, this ain't for thing for TV.

1:35:13.190 --> 1:35:14.501
It can't be televised.

1:35:14.536 --> 1:35:15.571
Every day a gamble.

1:35:15.606 --> 1:35:17.125
You get up and roll the dice.

1:35:17.159 --> 1:35:19.748
You never know what's waiting
for you on the other side,

1:35:19.783 --> 1:35:21.370
on the other side.

1:35:21.405 --> 1:35:23.062
I can see it in their eyes that
I'm something that they fear.

1:35:23.096 --> 1:35:25.650
Homie caught his first body,
but he did it out of fear.

1:35:25.685 --> 1:35:27.583
Survival of the fittest
don't mistake quietness.

1:35:27.618 --> 1:35:28.826
Fear.

1:35:28.861 --> 1:35:29.931
Claim you ready for
the smoke with no,

1:35:29.965 --> 1:35:33.279
all I see is-- fear, fear.

1:35:33.313 --> 1:35:34.798
You know I'm traumatized.

1:35:34.832 --> 1:35:36.903
When I hear the front door,
you can see it in my eyes.

1:35:36.938 --> 1:35:38.456
You ever felt like that close.

1:35:38.491 --> 1:35:41.390
The only thing I know, is
you shouldn't trust the soul.

1:35:41.425 --> 1:35:42.944
Probably the saints say.

1:35:42.978 --> 1:35:45.256
When I still living with my
mama, I left the crib at 17.

1:35:45.291 --> 1:35:48.156
If I don't say my prayer at
night, I have a bad dream.

1:35:48.190 --> 1:35:50.572
Penitentiary chances, hope
I don't go to the bing.

1:35:50.606 --> 1:35:53.333
Riding around in the traffic
with a thumper when I sling.

1:35:53.368 --> 1:35:56.095
I'm hoping somebody hear me
so it don't fall on deaf ears.

1:35:56.129 --> 1:35:58.683
I'm out here with the snakes
and the snake my biggest fear.

1:35:58.718 --> 1:35:59.995
I ain't trying to speak
it into existence.

1:36:00.030 --> 1:36:01.479
Hope I make myself clear.

1:36:01.514 --> 1:36:03.240
But please provide me with
some assistance sometime.

1:36:03.274 --> 1:36:04.448
I think death is near.

1:36:04.482 --> 1:36:05.414
This is real life.

1:36:05.449 --> 1:36:06.933
No, this ain't for TV.

1:36:06.968 --> 1:36:08.452
It can't be televised.

1:36:08.486 --> 1:36:09.522
Every day a gamble.

1:36:09.556 --> 1:36:11.041
You get up and roll the dice.

1:36:11.075 --> 1:36:13.802
You never know it's waiting
for you on the other side.

1:36:13.837 --> 1:36:15.770
On the other side.

1:36:15.804 --> 1:36:16.667
This is real life.

1:36:16.701 --> 1:36:17.737
No, this ain't for TV.

1:36:17.772 --> 1:36:19.290
It can't be televised.

1:36:19.325 --> 1:36:20.360
Every day a gamble.

1:36:20.395 --> 1:36:21.914
You get up and roll the dice.

1:36:21.948 --> 1:36:24.640
You never know what's waiting
for you on the other side,

1:36:24.675 --> 1:36:25.814
on the other side.

1:36:26.815 --> 1:36:28.748
Zip code, no shoes,
marble floors.

1:36:28.783 --> 1:36:30.025
Bitch tip toe.

1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:32.096
Floatsies with your
bitch at the Crypto.

1:36:32.131 --> 1:36:32.821
Yeah.

1:36:32.856 --> 1:36:34.098
Bunny rabbit did grow.

1:36:34.133 --> 1:36:36.031
Who's that peeping in my window?

1:36:36.066 --> 1:36:37.446
Got me--

1:36:37.481 --> 1:36:40.725
Tip toe, sing.

1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:42.210
Let you slide.

1:36:42.244 --> 1:36:43.659
Finna wrap them up in plastic,
just another homicide.

1:36:43.694 --> 1:36:45.627
And I drop them off
like axes, but you

1:36:45.661 --> 1:36:46.662
ain't no friend of mine.

1:36:46.697 --> 1:36:47.698
And I can't trust them, nothing.

1:36:47.732 --> 1:36:48.768
This is real life.

1:36:48.803 --> 1:36:50.287
No, this ain't for TV.

1:36:50.321 --> 1:36:51.564
It can't be televised.

1:36:51.598 --> 1:36:52.668
Every day a gamble.

1:36:52.703 --> 1:36:54.222
You get up and roll the dice.

1:36:54.256 --> 1:36:56.603
You never know what's waiting
for you on the other side.

1:36:56.638 --> 1:36:58.226
On the other side.

1:36:58.260 --> 1:36:59.917
I can see it in their eyes that
I'm something that they fear.

1:36:59.952 --> 1:37:02.747
Homie caught his first body,
but he did it out fear.

1:37:02.782 --> 1:37:04.715
Survival of the fittest,
don't mistake quietness.

1:37:04.749 --> 1:37:06.165
Fear.

1:37:06.199 --> 1:37:07.649
Claim you ready for this
smoke, but no, but all I see

1:37:07.683 --> 1:37:08.926
is fear, fear.

1:37:08.961 --> 1:37:10.169
One-- take a minute
to kick it with me.

1:37:10.203 --> 1:37:11.653
Let's talk about what
you're afraid of.

1:37:11.687 --> 1:37:12.654
You're aware that
fear is something

1:37:12.688 --> 1:37:13.482
that only exist in your mind.

1:37:13.517 --> 1:37:14.518
So what you made of?

1:37:14.552 --> 1:37:15.657
They're afraid of my growth.

1:37:15.691 --> 1:37:16.969
Majority shit you
see is made up.

1:37:17.003 --> 1:37:18.418
I put all my faith in
my god and make sure

1:37:18.453 --> 1:37:19.695
we talk every time I wake up.

1:37:19.730 --> 1:37:21.456
Like, listen, Lord,
I ain't no angel,

1:37:21.490 --> 1:37:22.491
but, nigga, with feelings, Lord.

1:37:22.526 --> 1:37:23.803
A good nigga with a good heart.

1:37:23.838 --> 1:37:25.425
Did everybody trying
to turn it to the Lord.

1:37:25.460 --> 1:37:27.358
And I know that me having faith
is the first step I gotta take.

1:37:27.393 --> 1:37:28.773
The mean hitter, Lord.

1:37:28.808 --> 1:37:29.740
So forgive me, Lord as I
put on these black gloves

1:37:29.774 --> 1:37:30.637
and kill these niggas, Lord.

1:37:30.672 --> 1:37:31.638
Fear.
