WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:04.872
Can't let you do it.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.607
Can't let you break my record.

00:09.777 --> 00:10.944
(groans)

00:15.116 --> 00:18.018
LENNY/CARL/BARNEY:
27... 28...

00:18.052 --> 00:20.588
Okay, Homer, this is
the last pickled egg.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.523
Keep it down
and you win 50 bucks.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.759
(grunting): Okay. If I win,
we're going out for omelets.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.395
(moans)

00:28.729 --> 00:32.833
Yeah! I am the champion
of this very bad idea!

00:32.866 --> 00:34.502
-(rumbling)
-Uh-oh.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.936
He's gonna blow!

00:39.440 --> 00:42.276
Hey, Moe, you're not gonna serve
those eggs, are you?

00:42.310 --> 00:45.946
No, no. I, uh... I find
another use for 'em.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.888
Hmm.

00:54.922 --> 00:58.326
I was 50 bucks up until I blew
every egg out of my belly.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.028
-Oh!
-(horn honks)

01:01.061 --> 01:03.131
MAN:
Whoa! Hey there, pal.

01:03.164 --> 01:07.034
(chuckles) I'm afraid that was
the mayor's favorite light pole.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.036
-(shrieks)
-You give me the car,

01:09.069 --> 01:12.940
I give you 500 bucks
and I make all of this go away.

01:12.973 --> 01:16.144
Uh, this is awkward.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.146
You don't have to thank me.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.513
Ugh!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.116
Marge.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.951
When you start a sentence
with "Marge,"

01:23.984 --> 01:25.253
it's really bad.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.921
Marge, Marge, Marge.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.891
-I sold our car!
-(gasps)

01:30.924 --> 01:33.427
-What are you gonna drive?
-Your car.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.230
Oh. Well, then I guess
I'll be riding the bus.

01:36.264 --> 01:39.833
That's right. Like rock stars
and Rosa Parks.

01:39.867 --> 01:43.171
Now just wait till you see
what's become of our car.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.106
Feast your eyes on this!

01:46.140 --> 01:48.776
* Four-legged angel

01:48.809 --> 01:51.078
* Who will speak for you?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.747
-* Raised in the rain
-(grunting softly)

01:53.781 --> 01:57.017
* With no bone to chew

01:57.050 --> 02:00.154
* Well, maybe

02:00.188 --> 02:02.356
* Someone will love you.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.924
Why are you showing me this?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.092
I don't get it.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.495
And I'm crying. (cries)

02:07.528 --> 02:09.297
Lousy wrong channel.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.301
ANNOUNCER: The Legends
of Demolition Derby-Derby-Derby

02:13.334 --> 02:16.136
are coming to Springfield-
Springfield-Springfield!

02:16.170 --> 02:17.705
So shut up!

02:17.738 --> 02:19.139
And get your ass-ass-ass

02:19.173 --> 02:22.042
over-over-over here-here-here!

02:22.075 --> 02:23.377
Proceeds go

02:23.411 --> 02:25.012
to stuttering-
stuttering-stuttering.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.581
Wait for it. Wait for it.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.288
ANNOUNCER: We've got all
the Demolition Derby greats!

02:34.322 --> 02:36.190
Vince "Dead Tooth" McGee!

02:36.224 --> 02:38.226
James "Psychiatric Disorder"
Porter.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.460
"Meth" MacFarland.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.495
Mysterious Fandango

02:41.529 --> 02:44.131
and a very drunk Billy Joel.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.034
I'm sorry, but most of
these names mean nothing to me.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.702
Here it comes!

02:48.736 --> 02:50.971
ANNOUNCER: And making
his triumphant return

02:51.004 --> 02:54.342
to the Crash Zone
after a full skull transplant,

02:54.375 --> 02:56.710
Gene "No Helmet" Dupree!

02:56.744 --> 03:00.348
Eh? My car
in a demolition derby!

03:00.381 --> 03:02.883
And we got primo tickets
for Saturday night.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.685
Look at 'em fan.

03:04.718 --> 03:05.986
Wait, wait, wait.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.222
This is the point
where Lisa always ruins it.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.357
No, I'm good with it.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.524
People get out their aggression

03:10.558 --> 03:12.826
and destroy carbon-burning cars.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.161
See? Ruined it.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.696
And then I noticed

03:15.729 --> 03:19.166
there wasn't any more cinnamon
on top of my rice pudding.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.369
And I said,
"Where's the cinnamon?"

03:21.402 --> 03:24.438
And they said, "There never
was any cinnamon, Abe."

03:24.472 --> 03:26.240
Fine, Dad, we'll get you
some cinnamon!

03:26.274 --> 03:28.041
I can't tolerate cinnamon!

03:28.075 --> 03:30.544
So, I started asking everyone
in the TV room

03:30.578 --> 03:32.112
if they remembered the cinnamon,

03:32.145 --> 03:34.181
and the answer
will surprise you.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.916
The results were incon...

03:35.949 --> 03:37.951
-(inaudible)
-When did you get that put in?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.953
Worth every penny.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.723
But how many pennies is that?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.758
Homer Simpson, you can't just...

03:44.792 --> 03:47.227
("Theme from a Summer Place"
by Percy Faith playing)

03:56.270 --> 03:57.538
Hmm.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.206
All right, young'uns.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.875
You know that movie Cars
that you likes?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.210
ALL:
Uh-huh.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.212
Well,
all your favorite characters

04:05.245 --> 04:07.915
is gonna commit suicide
here today.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.149
-Huh?
-What?

04:12.820 --> 04:14.588
ANNOUNCER (British accent):
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:14.622 --> 04:17.591
please silence all cell phones

04:17.625 --> 04:20.994
and holster all truck nuts.

04:21.028 --> 04:24.432
And now, in conformance with the
latest paleontological theories

04:24.465 --> 04:26.667
about dinosaurs, please welcome

04:26.700 --> 04:29.903
the all-new Truckasaurus Two.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.239
(audience booing)

04:32.272 --> 04:34.675
(robotic): I love you,
Steven Spielberg.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.577
ANNOUNCER:
Now, a brief moment in memory

04:36.610 --> 04:40.247
of those we lost
in the past week.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.683
(audience clapping)

04:45.453 --> 04:47.921
(audience booing)

04:47.955 --> 04:50.324
(audience clapping)

04:52.826 --> 04:54.194
And now...

04:54.227 --> 04:56.296
(Southern accent):
let the bash-'em-ups begin!

04:56.330 --> 04:58.932
(engines revving)

04:58.966 --> 05:01.201
If I get hit by a brain,
can I keep it?

05:01.234 --> 05:03.270
Be sure to get it signed
afterwards.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.472
(gasps)
There's our car!

05:05.806 --> 05:09.677
Wow. Without Dad's weight in it,
it really moves.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.179
(audience cheering)

05:16.484 --> 05:18.118
Oh, my God, this is it.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.721
Only one car stands in our way.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.623
ANNOUNCER:
It's down to Homer's Boner

05:22.656 --> 05:24.224
and Car-rak Obama,

05:24.257 --> 05:27.327
the Affordable Health Care
Mobile,

05:27.361 --> 05:30.163
which you can't kill
no matter how hard you try.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.733
(audience booing, whistling)

05:34.201 --> 05:35.536
(engine revs)

05:35.569 --> 05:38.739
My whole life has been leading
to this one moment.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.008
(engines revving)

05:41.041 --> 05:43.210
Oh! My chest hurts!

05:43.243 --> 05:44.378
That's called pride.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.479
(engine revs)

05:45.513 --> 05:46.814
My arm is numb!

05:46.847 --> 05:47.915
Numb with pride.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.016
(engine revs)

05:49.049 --> 05:51.652
Son, I need to go
to the hospital.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.721
-Huh?
-(grunting)

05:53.754 --> 05:55.623
Sure, Dad.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.864
("Adagio for Strings"
by Samuel Barber playing)

06:06.900 --> 06:08.201
-(crashing)
-(cheering)

06:12.740 --> 06:14.908
-I missed it.
-(explosion)

06:14.942 --> 06:17.010
Can you see the pain
you're causing him?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.346
Go on, git!

06:19.379 --> 06:22.683
I'm sorry to say
it, uh, doesn't look good.

06:22.716 --> 06:27.354
Homer, your father would like
to see you, uh, one last time.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.290
I hope you've got a return
receipt on that balloon.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.527
-I always do.
-(chuckles sadly)

06:33.561 --> 06:37.364
(weakly): Homer, there's
something I need to tell you.

06:37.397 --> 06:41.368
I'll give you two a moment
in this, uh, semiprivate room.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.537
Where is the nurse with my...

06:43.571 --> 06:47.941
Son, I did a terrible thing
many years ago,

06:47.975 --> 06:51.712
and I need you to forgive me
before... (coughs)

06:51.745 --> 06:54.214
before it's too late.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.317
-(crying): Anything, Dad.
-Mm, mm.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.919
(whispers inaudibly)

06:58.952 --> 07:00.253
Uh-huh.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.722
(whispers inaudibly)

07:01.755 --> 07:03.090
Uh-huh.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.758
(whispers inaudibly)

07:04.792 --> 07:06.660
You already said that part.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.229
Remember, you can't tell anyone.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.430
It's awful!

07:10.464 --> 07:12.600
I swear. Now get to the point.

07:12.633 --> 07:16.003
(whispers inaudibly)

07:16.036 --> 07:17.437
You didn't!

07:18.972 --> 07:20.440
Okay. (sighs)

07:20.474 --> 07:22.009
I forgive you.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.579
Your conscience is the one
clean thing in this room.

07:25.613 --> 07:26.780
(moans weakly)

07:28.682 --> 07:31.685
Well, we tried everything
we could...

07:31.719 --> 07:33.153
and the last thing worked.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.489
(gasps) How did you save him?

07:35.523 --> 07:37.290
When a body is
in too much pain,

07:37.324 --> 07:40.460
the brain releases a hormone
to bring a merciful death.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.664
But an expensive new drug
blocks that and keeps him alive.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.533
What a glorious day!

07:45.566 --> 07:47.334
I'm gonna live!

07:47.367 --> 07:51.438
And my son has forgiven me
for the worst thing I ever did.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.007
Yes. Forgiven.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.776
(grunts)

07:55.809 --> 08:00.013
(gasps) Sir, you just destroyed
a box of hospital cotton balls.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.683
-That's $75,000.
-D'oh!

08:05.152 --> 08:08.055
(laughs) Now I want to watch
my favorite new show,

08:08.088 --> 08:10.858
currently in its 17th season.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.193
(theme song playing)

08:30.878 --> 08:34.882
It looks like another murder
at Jackson Island Naval Base.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.817
That's what makes America great.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.553
Prompt investigation
of in-house naval crimes.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.589
Homie, look who's here.

08:41.622 --> 08:42.990
Yeah, I see.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.058
Oh, Homer,
are you a Sunday puzzle?

08:45.092 --> 08:47.728
'Cause you sure seem down
and a'cross.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.564
My dad did something to me
I can never forgive.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.532
No worse than what
God did to his son,

08:52.566 --> 08:54.001
and they wrote a book together.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.535
Bye.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.872
He tricked me with his code blue
and his flatlining.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.741
And I fell for it like a sap.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.009
What did he do?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.377
I promised him
not to say what he told me,

09:04.411 --> 09:07.581
but I will never look at him
the same way again.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.784
Yeah, but you forgave me, so
that means you have to love me.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.452
Nyeah, nyeah, nyeah,
nyeah, nyeah.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.087
Marjorie, I'm sorry,

09:14.121 --> 09:17.024
but I do not want to be in
the same room with this man.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.258
I'm going to Moe's.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.760
Then I'm going to Moe's!

09:19.793 --> 09:22.596
Then I'm staying here!
(grumbles)

09:22.630 --> 09:24.231
(grunting)

09:24.264 --> 09:25.933
A gun and a sailor hat.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.201
Nothing screams naval crime
more than that.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.271
(theme song playing)

09:31.304 --> 09:32.806
I'm going to Moe's.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.776
I hate seeing a father and a son

09:35.809 --> 09:37.577
sit at opposite ends of the bar.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.446
'Cause it means
I got to walk more.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.149
Now come on, youse guys.
Bury the old hatchet.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.784
(both groan)

09:43.817 --> 09:45.252
Hey, life is short.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.154
You could be killed
by a drunk driver,

09:47.187 --> 09:49.990
die of cirrhosis,
stabbed in a bar fight.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.960
All kinds of random bad things
happen to my customers.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.728
All right, look,
here's 50 cents, huh?

09:54.762 --> 09:56.930
Play the jukebox
and the love tester.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.365
(Homer and Grampa groan)

09:59.432 --> 10:00.934
* Hit the road, Jack

10:00.968 --> 10:02.435
* And don't you come back

10:02.469 --> 10:04.938
* No more, no more,
no more, no more *

10:04.972 --> 10:06.907
* Hit the road...

10:06.940 --> 10:09.109
You heard Ray Charles.

10:09.142 --> 10:12.112
Actually, in my jukebox,
we can't afford no Ray Charles.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.247
It's a white guy named,
uh, Charles Ray.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.583
Excellent vision,
excellent vision.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.787
Dad, Grampa, the place
we're going is the perfect way

10:19.820 --> 10:21.789
to make you guys friends again.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.857
I went there
for Janey's last birthday party.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.659
You think
you can solve our problems

10:25.693 --> 10:27.627
at a kids' birthday party place?

10:27.661 --> 10:30.597
It's cheaper than therapy,
and it comes with cake.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.467
If cake solved problems, Homer
would have a Nobel Peace Prize.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.303
That's a bullcrap prize.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.838
They gave it to Kissinger.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.442
Welcome to the Escape Zone,

10:42.475 --> 10:46.113
the latest attempt to get people
to save a dying mall.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.648
Now, would you like
to be buried alive?

10:48.682 --> 10:49.850
Done it for real.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.952
How about Medieval Dungeon?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.988
Got to be less torture
than listening to him. Hey.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.189
Thank you.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.859
Okay, you two are trapped
in a dungeon.

10:58.892 --> 11:02.329
The only way out is to solve
ten puzzles by working together.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.396
Yeah, whatever.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.398
-Super!
-(lock clicks)

11:05.432 --> 11:07.167
They're just sitting there.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.469
I bet they'd hurry
if they knew we had balloons.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.971
They're moving.

11:11.004 --> 11:15.175
Son, if you take this sword and
stick it in that magic portal,

11:15.208 --> 11:18.411
I think it might open
a bookcase somewhere.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.581
(gasps) Yes, that makes
perfect sense. I'll just...

11:21.614 --> 11:23.817
(screaming)

11:23.851 --> 11:25.418
(laughing)

11:26.887 --> 11:30.223
Homer? You're not getting out
to say good-bye to your dad?

11:30.257 --> 11:32.325
He's probably afraid
we'll see how much

11:32.359 --> 11:34.327
the car lifts when he gets out.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.064
No, I'm not.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.699
There's only one way
to make you guys understand.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.335
I'll tell you
what Grampa told me.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.571
(stammering)
That was in confidence.

11:44.604 --> 11:48.241
And in this family, we keep
our promises. Starting now.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.277
I am telling!

11:50.310 --> 11:53.546
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I hate conflict.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.382
(panicked breathing)

11:55.415 --> 11:58.451
-Then just leave your body.
-Okay.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.719
Hey!

12:00.988 --> 12:02.722
(grunts)

12:02.756 --> 12:05.092
When I was growing up,
my dad loved to make

12:05.125 --> 12:07.194
model World War II airplanes.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.595
(imitating airplane)

12:08.628 --> 12:10.263
Watch it, son.
You're gonna break the wing.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.732
Oh, now you got glue
up your nose.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.668
Oh! Don't eat the decal.
How many have you had?

12:16.770 --> 12:19.006
Just leave me be.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.610
Oh!

12:23.643 --> 12:26.413
I work hard all week
at the model plane factory,

12:26.446 --> 12:28.448
and this hobby is my one escape.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.151
Can you please watch
this little monster?

12:31.184 --> 12:32.786
HOMER:
When he gave me to her,

12:32.820 --> 12:34.788
it was the best thing
he could've done.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.790
-This is the dough.
-Dough.

12:36.824 --> 12:41.494
Yes, dough. Now, I need someone
very strong to roll this out.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.596
YOUNG HOMER:
* Recipes

12:44.798 --> 12:48.802
* For the oven in my mind

12:50.103 --> 12:53.941
* 3x5 cards with the recipes

12:56.309 --> 12:59.179
* Of my mother's pies

12:59.212 --> 13:03.183
* Apple cobbler

13:03.216 --> 13:06.053
* Peach pie, key lime,
and meringue *

13:08.989 --> 13:13.493
* Pies made for me
by my mother *

13:13.526 --> 13:17.697
* While my father
would harangue *

13:17.730 --> 13:20.333
* Can it be that

13:20.367 --> 13:23.937
* It was all so tasty then?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.873
* Was her rhubarb

13:25.906 --> 13:29.176
* So sublime?

13:29.209 --> 13:31.111
* If we had the chance

13:31.144 --> 13:34.214
* To bake it all again

13:34.247 --> 13:35.916
* Tell me, would we?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.887
* Could we?

13:39.920 --> 13:43.056
Love you.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.892
HOMER:
She loved me.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.861
And for each pie she made,
she wrote down the recipe

13:47.895 --> 13:50.563
and put a special note to me
on the back.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.900
We don't know
what life will bring,

13:52.933 --> 13:56.136
so on your birthday
or any day you need it,

13:56.169 --> 13:58.638
you'll know
that your mother loved you

13:58.671 --> 14:01.408
and have reasons
to love yourself.

14:01.441 --> 14:05.178
You just taught me food is love.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.148
I like myself.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.849
HOMER:
That lunch box

14:09.883 --> 14:11.784
was the most valuable
possession I ever had.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.755
(sobbing)
When she left,

14:15.788 --> 14:18.258
those recipes
were all I had left of her.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.227
And that's the end.
What a sweet story.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.329
And there's some things
that shouldn't be gone into

14:22.362 --> 14:25.098
until a man is dead
and can't be kicked.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.034
After she ran away,
my father was furious

14:27.067 --> 14:29.069
and did something terrible.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.906
He threw my recipes
off a cliff.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.909
Everything
that reminded him of her.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.716
He lied to me.

14:43.750 --> 14:47.287
He told me she took the recipes
with her when she left.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.922
Are you sure, Daddy?

14:48.956 --> 14:51.624
Yes. And don't ask me again
till I'm on my deathbed.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.863
(stammers) Wait.
Why are you looking like that?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.099
If this man had had those notes,

14:59.132 --> 15:01.234
his life
would've been different.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.735
He would've had confidence.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.804
He would've had
his mother with him!

15:04.837 --> 15:06.606
I would've had hair!

15:06.639 --> 15:08.808
Homie, that's not
very realistic.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.278
And I would've been
more realistic.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.648
MARGE:
Grampa, so thoughtless.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.885
-Mean old man.
-His slippers don't even have
bottoms anymore.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.889
I never thought I'd say this
word, but here it comes: coot.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.292
Homer, why are you smiling?

15:25.325 --> 15:29.362
We're finally hating together
as a family.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.733
What do you say we all go
to that home and yell at Grampa?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.835
Oh, that would be lovely.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.405
Now enjoy
this sweet song of hate.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.509
* If I could save hate
in a bottle *

15:42.542 --> 15:45.912
* The first thing
that I'd like to do *

15:45.945 --> 15:48.481
* Is to hate every day

15:48.515 --> 15:51.451
* Till eternity passes away

15:51.484 --> 15:55.755
* Then end
with a giant "screw you" *

15:55.788 --> 15:59.659
* But there never seems
to be enough time *

15:59.692 --> 16:02.129
* To hate the things
you want to hate *

16:02.162 --> 16:04.531
* Once you hate them.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.499
(sobbing)

16:06.533 --> 16:08.001
(Marge moans softly)

16:08.035 --> 16:11.471
-Lousy Grampa.
-MARGE: So heartless.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.806
Always calls me
"buddy" or "fella."

16:13.840 --> 16:16.176
Don't forget
he's hard of hearing.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.011
Lousy Grampa!

16:18.045 --> 16:19.779
So heartless!

16:19.812 --> 16:22.149
What you did was crap, Grampa!

16:22.182 --> 16:25.485
-I want to yell at him first.
-I want to yell at him first.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.288
Hey, has anyone considered
the silent treatment?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.157
The silent treatment
doesn't work.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.193
It doesn't work.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.795
It does not work.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.997
(grunts) Okay, fine, it works.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.567
It works so well.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.570
Please say something.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.472
(grunts)

16:45.505 --> 16:47.507
How long has it been?
Three months?

16:47.540 --> 16:50.009
I don't even remember
a time before this.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.347
Where's Grampa?

16:54.381 --> 16:58.251
-He hasn't touched his lunch.
-Or his lunch meds.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.687
"My beloved family..."

17:00.720 --> 17:02.689
Oh, boy.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.024
GRAMPA: "I've learned
an important lesson,

17:05.058 --> 17:07.594
"never get things
off your chest.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.163
"Which reminds me of a gal
named Chesty Lazar.

17:10.197 --> 17:14.334
"She ran a speakeasy on Hawaii
right before Pearl Harbor.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.069
"Pearl Harbor
was the name of the lady

17:16.103 --> 17:17.737
who bought the joint..."

17:17.770 --> 17:20.540
Digression... digression...

17:20.573 --> 17:23.243
crazy talk...
Ah, here's the end.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.577
GRAMPA:
The point is,

17:24.611 --> 17:27.414
confessing don't really
make you feel better,

17:27.447 --> 17:30.283
'cause it don't redo
the bad thing you did.

17:30.317 --> 17:33.886
So I'm gonna undo what I done
if it's the last thing I do.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.257
Hmm. Mm...

17:37.290 --> 17:41.294
Oh, no. He's heading for that
cliff to look for those recipes.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.895
I'm gonna find him, save him,

17:42.929 --> 17:46.599
and tell him I can't wait
till he dies.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.769
Leave me alone!
I'm gonna find it!

17:49.802 --> 17:52.772
Don't do it, Dad!
Most is forgiven!

17:55.675 --> 17:58.311
Wait, what's your rope tied to?

17:58.345 --> 17:59.946
(both screaming)

18:01.248 --> 18:02.282
(groans)

18:02.315 --> 18:03.383
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.084
(both groan)

18:05.118 --> 18:06.319
(gasps) Oh, my God.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.291
ALL:
Please be okay. Please be okay.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.126
(grunting)

18:13.160 --> 18:14.961
Oh...

18:14.994 --> 18:16.062
Hmm?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.298
-(grunting)
-(laughs)

18:19.332 --> 18:21.000
(grunting)

18:22.435 --> 18:24.003
(sighs, sobs)

18:24.036 --> 18:25.505
GRAMPA:
Don't worry, son.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.007
This will give you
all the rope you need.

18:29.509 --> 18:33.112
Dad, no! I love you!
Mom left, but you were there.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.482
Cranky, a little drunk,
sometimes not there,

18:35.515 --> 18:37.317
but you were always there.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.952
(sobbing):
Oh. You love me.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.854
That's all I need to hear.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.156
(shouts)

18:43.190 --> 18:44.357
(grunts)

18:44.391 --> 18:47.627
(screams, laughs)

18:47.660 --> 18:50.430
Good thing I also threw out
your mother's bed when she left.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.867
I can still smell her perfume.
(inhales deeply)

18:54.901 --> 18:56.869
And I've got the recipes back.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.605
(hollow rattling)

18:58.638 --> 18:59.806
Huh?

18:59.839 --> 19:04.110
Oh. They're gone, just like Mom.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.146
-I'm sorry, son.
-It's okay, Dad.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.282
Life doesn't always give you
neat endings

19:09.316 --> 19:11.150
that tie everything up in a bow.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.687
-Mmm!
-Mmm.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.524
This pie is fantastic.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.960
It's what I imagine eating
great jazz would be like.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.795
Always with the jazz.

19:22.829 --> 19:26.399
It tastes exactly like
my mom used to make.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.635
Exactly!

19:28.668 --> 19:31.704
Excuse me, how the hell
did you get this recipe?

19:31.738 --> 19:33.706
It was a miracle, actually.

19:33.740 --> 19:37.076
33 years ago,
this place wasn't doing well,

19:37.109 --> 19:40.046
possibly due to our location
under a cliff.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.515
I went out to contemplate
my fate...

19:42.549 --> 19:46.253
when, suddenly, like a gift
from God, the recipes came.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.689
(magical music plays)

19:53.260 --> 19:54.861
I'd never seen such recipes,

19:54.894 --> 19:56.929
such brilliant
fruit combinations

19:56.963 --> 19:59.266
and such beautiful messages
on the back.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.738
(gasps)
Those messages were for me.

20:05.772 --> 20:09.008
Well, then you should have them.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.579
(gasps)
Everything tied up in a bow.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.219
What's it say?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.189
It says, uh...

20:23.222 --> 20:26.125
"Your father is an okay guy."

20:26.158 --> 20:29.896
-Aw, thanks for telling me.
-Thanks for buying it.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.163
(both laughing)

20:34.634 --> 20:36.436
Mr. Simpson,
based on your budget,

20:36.469 --> 20:39.539
I am afraid there's only one car
on this lot you can afford.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.541
-(gasps)
-You know this car?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.410
Do I!

20:43.443 --> 20:46.379
Aw, I thought
that's where you were.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.616
-(screeching)
-Geez, what's wrong with her?

21:29.155 --> 21:31.524
Shh!

21:34.026 --> 21:35.995
