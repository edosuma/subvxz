(serene music playing)

01:04.967 --> 01:05.900
Oh, there it is.

01:05.967 --> 01:08.033
What are you doing
with my resume?

01:08.100 --> 01:09.767
Punching it up.
How's this?

01:09.834 --> 01:16.133
"1946-1984, took part in extensive
anthropological research."

01:17.266 --> 01:19.333
Why anthropological research?

01:19.400 --> 01:23.734
It's better than saying,
"Married to a baboon for 38 years."

01:25.467 --> 01:27.600
Look, if I'm going to get this job
as vice principal,

01:27.667 --> 01:29.166
I'm going to get it honestly.

01:29.233 --> 01:33.233
Ooh, girls, I have a date
with the most cultured, urbane,

01:33.300 --> 01:35.633
sophisticated man
in the whole world.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.767
You know George "Goober" Lindsey?

01:40.467 --> 01:42.533
Even more sophisticated, Rose.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.233
His name's Donald Parker Everett.
He's the museum's new curator.

01:46.300 --> 01:50.300
It's not a good idea
to date someone you work with.

01:50.367 --> 01:53.233
You talk about
Ted the track coach,

01:53.300 --> 01:54.900
how sexy and virile he is.

01:54.967 --> 01:57.700
Just talk.
I wouldn't dream of chasing him.

01:57.767 --> 02:00.233
If she did, he'd outrun her.

02:02.300 --> 02:08.600
(laughing)

02:09.934 --> 02:11.934
Rose, it's not that funny.

02:12.433 --> 02:16.734
I know, I think I better keep
the lid on this paint thinner.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.667
Dorothy,
I can't finish this picture.

02:23.734 --> 02:24.533
Why not?

02:24.600 --> 02:26.600
I can't paint a horse from memory.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.000
You need a model.

02:28.066 --> 02:32.166
I know where you can see a horse

02:32.233 --> 02:35.533
and lots of little men
in silk pants with whips.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.333
Or you could go
to the race track instead.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.433
That could be fun, Dorothy.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.667
I haven't been to the track
in 15 years.

02:47.734 --> 02:52.066
Go. It'll be fun, and Rose
can memorize a horse.

02:52.133 --> 02:55.533
-I'd rather not.
-Please, be a pal.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.700
I'd do it for you.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.567
Why can't you go alone?

02:58.633 --> 03:03.400
You always meet lecherous guys
out for a good time

03:03.467 --> 03:05.667
who think they can impress you
by throwing money around.

03:05.734 --> 03:08.433
Damn! I wish I didn't
have to go to work today.

03:10.934 --> 03:13.133
Well, Dorothy, you go.
You can relax

03:13.200 --> 03:15.967
and take your mind off
your job interview tomorrow.

03:16.033 --> 03:18.533
-Oh, all right.
-Oh, good.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.033
I'd lend you my pass
to the Jockey's lounge,

03:22.100 --> 03:24.200
but you don't want
to date a jockey.

03:24.266 --> 03:25.667
The sex is over too fast.

03:25.734 --> 03:28.333
Afterwards,
the only nice thing he says is,

03:28.400 --> 03:31.000
"Good girl. Good girl."

03:38.867 --> 03:42.133
Sophia, I've decided to wear
this little watch on a chain

03:42.200 --> 03:46.000
nestled cunningly in my cleavage.

03:46.066 --> 03:48.100
What other accessories to I need?

03:48.166 --> 03:49.834
Implants.

03:51.734 --> 03:53.533
Dorothy's parking the car.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.400
I have to get a horse
in this picture

03:55.467 --> 03:57.734
while it's still fresh in my mind.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.100
I don't know whether
to paint old silver,

04:00.166 --> 04:01.900
the horse that brought
the news to St. Olaf

04:01.967 --> 04:04.567
that the British had no
intention of coming...

04:06.233 --> 04:09.834
or old brisker, the horse who
because of a printing error

04:09.900 --> 04:13.367
on the ballot slips was elected
water commissioner for six months.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.867
-Hi.
-Did you have fun at the track?

04:18.934 --> 04:20.133
The track?

04:20.200 --> 04:21.900
We had a wonderful day.

04:21.967 --> 04:26.066
Thanks to Dorothy's tips,
I made money for art supplies.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.166
Dorothy, come to the kitchen.

04:28.233 --> 04:30.333
Sorry. I'm a little busy.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.133
Fine. I'll eat chili.
We'll talk later in your bedroom.

04:40.066 --> 04:41.934
Coming, mother.

04:46.567 --> 04:47.934
What were you doing
at the race track?

04:47.967 --> 04:50.967
You're making
too much of this.

04:51.033 --> 04:53.033
I haven't gambled in 15 years.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.967
I didn't make bets for myself.

04:56.033 --> 04:59.233
It was nice to know
I could still pick a winner.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.867
This from a woman
whose Dukakis bumper sticker

05:01.934 --> 05:04.700
covers a Mondale bumper sticker?

05:04.767 --> 05:08.734
I admit once I did have
a small gambling problem.

05:08.800 --> 05:09.967
A small problem?

05:10.033 --> 05:14.033
You bet against your own son's
little league team.

05:14.100 --> 05:18.033
I had to. I knew their star pitcher
had detention.

05:18.100 --> 05:21.066
You were his teacher.
You gave him detention.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.867
Of all the things you could've
inherited from your father,

05:26.934 --> 05:28.834
you picked this gambling disease.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.400
Get off my back!

05:30.467 --> 05:35.033
I had a nice day at the track.
That's that.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.033
Pop didn't have a problem.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.667
I spent too many years denying
your father's addiction.

05:40.734 --> 05:43.000
He was a gambler
to his dying day.

05:43.066 --> 05:44.800
His last words were,

05:44.867 --> 05:47.467
"10 bucks says I don't
need this oxygen tank."

05:50.734 --> 05:52.700
(doorbell chimes)

05:58.800 --> 05:59.967
Why, Donald.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.567
I see by my watch
you're right on time.

06:03.567 --> 06:06.333
-You're looking lovely.
-Thank you.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.266
I'll just get my purse
and we'll go.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.900
This is Rose.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.033
Blanche, before you leave,
look at this horse.

06:14.100 --> 06:17.300
Does it look like Old Brisker's
pulling the beer wagon?

06:17.367 --> 06:21.166
Ask Donald to look.
He knows a lot about art.

06:21.233 --> 06:22.367
I'd be happy to.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.533
Well, it's quite good.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.000
It's an interesting primitive.

06:28.066 --> 06:31.600
In fact, it makes me
think of grandma Moses.

06:31.667 --> 06:35.300
She must've been strong
to do the work of a Clydesdale.

06:38.667 --> 06:42.834
You really can't blame her.
She doesn't work in a museum.

06:44.066 --> 06:49.066
I call them winter of St. Olaf,
spring and summer of St. Olaf.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.533
Why haven't you painted
the fall of St. Olaf?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.367
Because it hasn't happened yet.

06:56.467 --> 06:59.934
Although we came close
when new math came along.

07:01.633 --> 07:04.533
Rose, I think
he's referring to autumn.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.500
Donald, maybe we better go.

07:08.567 --> 07:12.500
Rose, we have a special section
for local artists.

07:12.567 --> 07:15.467
When you finish the series, maybe
we'll hang them in the museum.

07:15.533 --> 07:18.433
Wow. Hanging in the museum?

07:18.500 --> 07:22.166
None of my relatives
ever hung in a museum.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.667
Oh, wait. Uncle Gustav.

07:24.734 --> 07:27.333
Well, actually, he hung in the barn.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.333
That was only when he discovered

07:29.400 --> 07:32.033
his horse defeated him
for water commissioner.

07:36.734 --> 07:42.133
(mellow music playing)

07:44.166 --> 07:46.133
Oh, so you're studying
for your interview.

07:46.200 --> 07:51.867
Uh-huh. I know it's added
responsibility, but I want this job.

07:51.934 --> 07:54.333
Then why are you
reading the racing form?

07:54.400 --> 07:58.467
Why would you think
I'm reading the racing form?

07:58.533 --> 08:01.767
You can't lie to me.
Mothers always know lies.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.600
I knew what your brother Phil
did in the bathroom

08:04.667 --> 08:08.033
when he said he was oiling
his baseball glove.

08:13.367 --> 08:16.300
He was working on
his simplicity patterns.

08:19.033 --> 08:20.467
Good night.
Sleep tight.

08:20.533 --> 08:21.533
See you in the morning light.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.400
It's the best light to paint by.

08:24.467 --> 08:28.133
I like this painting,
and I'm getting better.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.166
Soon I'll be able to copy
St. Olaf's most religious painting,

08:32.233 --> 08:34.567
<i>The last Pancake Breakfast.</i>

08:40.734 --> 08:41.767
Blanche!

08:41.834 --> 08:43.767
Honey, what's wrong?
You're shaking.

08:43.834 --> 08:46.533
I have been humiliated
and degraded.

08:46.600 --> 08:50.000
Many times.
You just figured it out now?

08:52.266 --> 08:54.233
The evening started
off wonderfully.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.133
Donald took me
to a beautiful restaurant.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.100
He ordered everything in French,

08:58.166 --> 09:00.467
which totally confused
our waiter Chip.

09:01.867 --> 09:04.800
He took me dancing.
He was a perfect gentleman.

09:04.867 --> 09:08.000
Get to the humiliation
and degradation part.

09:08.066 --> 09:10.500
I suggested we go to his place.

09:10.567 --> 09:13.533
Once there, I went
to the bathroom to freshen up.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.967
After I had removed
all of my clothes...

09:18.767 --> 09:22.100
I noticed his monogrammed
velour bathrobe.

09:22.166 --> 09:25.200
Thinking only of his pleasure,
I decided to slip into it.

09:25.266 --> 09:27.066
I looked so fetching.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.300
I couldn't wait for him to see me.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.734
I emerged, framed in the doorway,

09:32.800 --> 09:36.967
and slowly let the bathrobe
slide from my perfect body.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.633
You know what he said?

09:40.700 --> 09:43.367
"Put your clothes on.
I'm taking you home."

09:44.700 --> 09:46.600
How could I ever
look him in the eye?

09:46.667 --> 09:48.667
I'll never go back to work.

09:49.667 --> 09:51.333
"Put your clothes on!"

09:51.400 --> 09:53.734
That's the first time anybody's
ever said that to me.

09:56.867 --> 09:59.233
Well, without shining
a flashlight in my face.

10:01.633 --> 10:06.333
(serene music playing)

10:06.400 --> 10:08.834
Hello, I'm Dorothy Zbornak.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.200
I have an appointment
about the vice principal's job.

10:12.266 --> 10:14.533
Unfortunately, my car broke down.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.967
I'm stuck at the mechanic's.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.967
Is there any way Mr. Pratt could
see me later this afternoon?

10:21.033 --> 10:22.433
He could?

10:22.500 --> 10:24.700
4:45 would be perfect.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.367
Thanks so much.
I'll see you then.

10:30.433 --> 10:33.233
$20 to win on Ma's Mouth.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.400
It's a hunch.

10:42.367 --> 10:46.266
(calm music playing)

10:48.433 --> 10:50.533
Hi.
You're still painting out there?

10:50.600 --> 10:53.133
Yeah, but I'm having trouble.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.934
It's impossible
to paint autumn in St. Olaf.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.333
How come?

10:58.400 --> 11:02.166
Maybe it's that horrible
St. Olaf falling leaf story.

11:03.467 --> 11:10.000
If this is a story about a man
named Leaf, I don't want to hear it.

11:10.066 --> 11:11.800
-It's not that long.
-No!

11:13.900 --> 11:15.700
It has a surprise ending.

11:15.767 --> 11:18.567
Ok. Just the ending,
but keep it short.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.367
Splat.

11:27.867 --> 11:30.467
-Hi, girls.
-Hi, Blanche.

11:30.533 --> 11:33.467
You're not wearing
that to work?

11:33.533 --> 11:36.400
No. I'm going to put on pumps
instead of slippers.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.266
Why does she even
ask such things?

11:40.333 --> 11:42.233
I'll allow the question.

11:44.066 --> 11:46.066
No, Rose, I'm not going to work.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.667
Girls, I just can't.

11:47.734 --> 11:49.200
Donald will be there.

11:49.266 --> 11:51.667
You'll have to face
that man sometime.

11:51.734 --> 11:55.800
I appreciate your concern, but
I won't go into that museum today.

11:55.867 --> 11:57.934
I have my dignity, my pride.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.266
Blanche, your copy of
<i>Slung Magazine </i>just arrived.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.433
Oh, thank you.

12:05.734 --> 12:07.834
Dorothy Zbornak,
you're in big trouble.

12:07.900 --> 12:08.967
What did I do?

12:09.033 --> 12:11.000
You lied to me.

12:11.066 --> 12:14.367
I went through your purse,
and look what I found,

12:14.433 --> 12:15.533
betting slips.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.266
You went to the track again.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.567
How could you, Dorothy?

12:19.633 --> 12:23.700
I've spent my best years giving
you a sense of moral responsibility.

12:23.767 --> 12:26.233
-Why were you in my purse?
-Stealing.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.767
Weren't you supposed
to interview yesterday?

12:32.834 --> 12:34.800
-I rescheduled.
-For when?

12:34.867 --> 12:37.567
All right. I rescheduled,
then missed the appointment.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.533
Dorothy, it's happening again.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.934
-You're losing control.
-I really didn't want that job.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.467
I don't need that kind of pressure.

12:45.533 --> 12:47.800
Know what you'll wind up with?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.667
Nothing.
Then what will you do?

12:49.734 --> 12:51.333
Sponge off your kids?

12:51.400 --> 12:52.567
Move in with them?

12:52.633 --> 12:54.333
Have them take care of you?

12:59.266 --> 13:00.700
Ok. Bad example.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.734
But I'm telling you,
this will ruin your life.

13:06.400 --> 13:10.834
-Dorothy, I'm worried about you.
-Please, don't you start.

13:10.900 --> 13:13.834
I had a problem 15 years ago.
That's a long time.

13:13.900 --> 13:16.033
I've learned a little since then.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.333
A lot has happened.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.767
I've lived with the temptations.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.400
Isn't that something?

13:22.467 --> 13:25.633
You think you know somebody, then
you find out something like this.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.633
-Hard to believe.
-I'll say.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.767
Dorothy's lived
with the temptations,

13:29.834 --> 13:32.767
and I've never been
to their concerts.

13:37.633 --> 13:41.633
(serene music playing)

13:45.700 --> 13:47.800
Rose, what are you doing?

13:47.867 --> 13:50.700
I heard the creative process
is like giving birth.

13:50.767 --> 13:53.867
I'm doing my Lamaze breathing.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.033
For a minute there,
I thought I wasn't the only one

13:58.100 --> 14:00.800
with the invisible man fantasy.

14:06.834 --> 14:10.567
I'm so uptight.
Donald's expecting this painting.

14:10.633 --> 14:12.033
I don't want to let him down.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.433
After what he did to me,
feel free to.

14:15.500 --> 14:19.300
I was thinking about that story
about you and Donald.

14:19.367 --> 14:22.400
When I dropped my robe,
stood there in my nakedness,

14:22.467 --> 14:25.367
and asked him for a romp?

14:25.433 --> 14:26.600
Right.

14:26.667 --> 14:29.500
I was wondering
if maybe you were too direct.

14:32.667 --> 14:33.633
In what way?

14:35.033 --> 14:37.433
How can I explain this?

14:37.500 --> 14:39.533
Ok.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.000
You see this little possum
in my St. Olaf painting?

14:43.066 --> 14:45.867
Every year she goes
into her mating ritual

14:45.934 --> 14:49.166
and gives off little signals.
She releases a scent.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.100
She changes the way she stands.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.266
She makes tiny little
whistling noises.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.333
I do that.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.633
Don't you see?
That's all she does.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.834
She plays hard to get.

15:01.900 --> 15:05.000
It works. Men find her attractive.

15:05.066 --> 15:06.400
You mean males.

15:06.467 --> 15:08.133
No. I mean men.

15:10.133 --> 15:13.000
Blanche, I need you to take
me to the eye doctor.

15:13.066 --> 15:14.467
It's time for a new prescription.

15:14.533 --> 15:16.033
I thought Dorothy was taking you?

15:16.100 --> 15:17.667
I don't know any Dorothy.

15:17.734 --> 15:21.133
She's your daughter, Sophia.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.066
I'm being dramatic, you moron.

15:26.033 --> 15:28.300
I mean,
I spit at the name Dorothy.

15:28.367 --> 15:29.834
I have no daughter.

15:32.133 --> 15:33.400
I have no spit.

15:37.266 --> 15:40.000
Honey, can't you go
to the eye doctor tomorrow?

15:40.066 --> 15:42.567
Please, I can hardly see my own
hand in front of my face.

15:42.633 --> 15:44.166
That's my hand, Sophia.

15:44.233 --> 15:46.133
Oh, thank God,
I saw so many liver spots,

15:46.200 --> 15:48.767
I thought I was being attacked
by a dalmatian.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.200
Dorothy. Zbornak.

15:56.266 --> 15:59.367
I need to place another bet.

15:59.433 --> 16:01.800
I'll get that money to you tomorrow.

16:01.867 --> 16:03.100
I'm good for it.

16:03.166 --> 16:06.400
A horse looks good to me
at Hialeah.

16:06.467 --> 16:09.600
Salisbury's Shrew
in the second race.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.600
Make it 100.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.000
(Sophia)
Let's go, Dorothy!

16:12.066 --> 16:13.667
Got to go.
Thanks, Frank.

16:16.700 --> 16:21.000
(mellow music playing)

16:24.800 --> 16:26.734
Sophia, why are you up?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.300
Same reason you're up.

16:28.367 --> 16:30.667
You're filled with anxiety?

16:30.734 --> 16:31.767
I'm old.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.367
I'm not old.

16:36.433 --> 16:37.700
Forgive me.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.467
I'm supposed to support your vain,
narcissistic fantasy

16:40.533 --> 16:43.400
that you're still in your 40s.

16:43.467 --> 16:46.367
It's either that
or a big rent raise.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.633
Hi. What are you doing up?

16:51.700 --> 16:54.433
Sophia's old,
and I'm filled with anxiety.

16:57.467 --> 16:59.567
Blanche, you can't stay home
from work forever.

16:59.633 --> 17:01.433
Can't you swallow your pride?

17:01.500 --> 17:05.333
No room for it. She just scarfed
a bag of chips ahoy.

17:05.834 --> 17:07.734
Why are you insulting me?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.567
It's a defense mechanism.

17:09.633 --> 17:12.400
It hides my feelings
when I'm deeply upset.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.200
Oh. Well, I understand.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.633
In that case,
I won't take it personally.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.867
Thanks, you human mattress.

17:25.433 --> 17:26.834
I'm sorry.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.934
I'm just so worried about Dorothy.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.800
I remember how bad it was when
she let gambling take over her life.

17:33.867 --> 17:36.767
I couldn't do anything.
She hit bottom.

17:36.834 --> 17:37.834
What happened?

17:37.900 --> 17:39.467
Because of gambling debts,

17:39.533 --> 17:41.767
she borrowed money
from loan sharks

17:41.834 --> 17:43.166
and couldn't pay it back.

17:43.233 --> 17:46.166
She was going
to lose her house.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.800
The only way was to get
Sal's life insurance.

17:49.867 --> 17:51.533
So you killed Sal?

17:55.567 --> 17:57.000
Of course, not.

17:57.066 --> 17:59.567
What kind of policy do you have?

18:01.433 --> 18:04.600
We cashed in the policies
and paid the sharks.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.166
I didn't give the money

18:06.233 --> 18:09.200
until she agreed to go
to gamblers anonymous.

18:09.266 --> 18:11.867
I understand
why you're deeply upset.

18:11.934 --> 18:13.467
Thanks, you human speed bump.

18:16.233 --> 18:18.233
Sorry.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.734
-We understand.
-We understand.

18:21.834 --> 18:26.967
(calm music playing)

18:27.033 --> 18:28.967
(telephone rings)

18:31.333 --> 18:34.600
I'll get it.
I'll get it. I'll get it.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.300
Hello.

18:36.367 --> 18:39.133
Yes, Frank, I'm aware of that.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.533
No, I'll have the money
to you today.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.133
Cash, of course.

18:49.266 --> 18:50.834
Dorothy, I need a fresh eye.

18:50.900 --> 18:53.500
-Does this look good to you?
-It's great.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.233
You didn't even look.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.300
You can't even tell me what it is.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.700
-Of course, I can.
-What the hell is it?

19:02.633 --> 19:03.967
That's it.

19:04.033 --> 19:07.100
I'm not painting
for the museum anymore.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.233
It's making me a nervous wreck.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.100
I used to love painting.

19:11.166 --> 19:12.834
It's becoming an obsession.

19:12.900 --> 19:16.133
-Obsessions can be dangerous.
-Because you're prone to them.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.166
-Some aren't.
-Where the hell's the racing form?

19:19.233 --> 19:20.500
Why do you need it?

19:20.567 --> 19:22.600
I don't.
It's not important.

19:22.667 --> 19:27.233
Actually, Rose, I need cash quick,

19:27.300 --> 19:29.700
and I'm up to my limit
at the automated teller.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.633
Is this about that phone call?

19:31.700 --> 19:33.200
Yes, yes.

19:33.266 --> 19:34.200
It's the paper boy.

19:34.266 --> 19:36.200
I forgot to pay him.

19:36.266 --> 19:37.200
How much?

19:37.266 --> 19:39.333
$250.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.233
Isn't that a lot
for the paper boy?

19:42.300 --> 19:44.133
Rose, the truth is...

19:45.166 --> 19:49.834
The truth is I need the money
so my mother can have an operation.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.367
Sophia needs an operation?

19:53.433 --> 19:55.066
Not an actual operation.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.233
She'll just have her face done.

19:57.734 --> 19:59.166
How's she getting it done?

19:59.233 --> 20:01.367
Southwestern, Rose!

20:03.433 --> 20:05.266
Look, Rose,
I need the money.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.834
You'll have to trust me.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.867
Of course, I trust you.

20:09.934 --> 20:11.500
You can take everything I have.

20:11.567 --> 20:13.533
Don't give me everything.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.633
All I need is a couple hundred
bucks to--

20:16.700 --> 20:19.900
You don't owe me
any explanation.

20:19.967 --> 20:23.133
I want you to take my bank card

20:23.200 --> 20:26.200
and take as much money
as you need.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.867
Pay me back whenever you can.

20:27.934 --> 20:28.967
Thanks a lot.

20:29.033 --> 20:32.000
I'll have this back
before you know it.

20:32.066 --> 20:34.400
No hurry,
I trust you completely.

20:34.467 --> 20:38.767
Well, Rose, you shouldn't
trust anyone completely.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.800
If I can't trust you,
whom can I trust?

20:41.867 --> 20:43.533
You're practically my sister.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.867
Sisters often lie, Rose,

20:45.934 --> 20:49.266
and even best friends take advantage
of each other occasionally.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.734
I don't think so.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.800
Rose, you should.
You're being very naive.

20:53.867 --> 20:55.033
I'm not naive.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.967
Yes, you are being naive now.

20:58.033 --> 21:00.633
Don't you see?
I'm stealing your money.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.233
I know, Dorothy.

21:03.734 --> 21:07.166
I'm hoping you'll have a hard time
taking advantage of somebody

21:07.233 --> 21:09.667
who cares about you like I do.

21:10.767 --> 21:11.900
I need help, Rose.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.433
Oh, God, I hate the lying!

21:15.500 --> 21:18.033
Dorothy, I lied to you too.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.500
You could never have
used that bank card.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.166
You don't have my personal
identification number.

21:28.233 --> 21:31.266
And you'd never guess it
in a thousand years.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.333
Rose, honey, it's right here.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.066
You've written it on the card.

21:36.567 --> 21:39.500
Well, that's because
I have trouble guessing it too.

21:41.633 --> 21:45.600
(soft music playing)

21:45.667 --> 21:48.000
I went to the podium and said,

21:48.066 --> 21:51.500
"My name is Dorothy,
and I have a gambling problem."

21:51.567 --> 21:54.200
When I left gamblers anonymous
15 years ago,

21:54.266 --> 21:57.400
I thought I'd never say that again.

21:57.467 --> 21:59.467
Let's hope this time's a cure.

21:59.533 --> 22:01.800
You're never really cured.

22:01.867 --> 22:05.967
You have to learn to live each day
one day at a time.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.667
If you took them two at a time,

22:08.734 --> 22:11.433
you'd be constantly
changing your underwear.

22:19.433 --> 22:21.100
Go ahead. Stand up and say it.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.500
My name is Rose,
and I'm an idiot.

22:27.533 --> 22:28.900
Oh, hi, girls.

22:28.967 --> 22:30.867
Blanche, you're finally dressed.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.300
Yeah. I went back to work.

22:32.367 --> 22:33.266
Good for you!

22:33.333 --> 22:36.533
You know what the reason
Donald rejected me was?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.467
He has this strict personal rule

22:38.533 --> 22:40.867
against getting involved
with co-workers.

22:40.934 --> 22:42.734
I told you.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.066
He knew it was
either violate this rule

22:45.133 --> 22:47.700
or quit and come after me.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.967
So he quit and asked me out.

22:51.033 --> 22:52.500
What did you say?

22:52.567 --> 22:54.667
I decided to take Rose's advice.

22:54.734 --> 22:58.000
I'm playing hard to get
like your possum.

22:58.066 --> 23:01.934
Did I mention hanging upside down
from the tree?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.266
I can do that.

23:14.300 --> 23:17.633
(theme music playing)
