00:06.600 --> 00:08.567
( theme music playing )

00:13.600 --> 00:15.533
Larry:
IT'S A MYSTERY TO ME--

00:15.567 --> 00:17.967
HOW COULD YOU
HAVE LIVED

00:18.000 --> 00:21.333
- WITH THAT MANIAC
FOR THAT LONG?
- ( laughs )

00:21.367 --> 00:23.833
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HUH?

00:23.867 --> 00:26.300
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HOW DID YOU DO IT?

00:26.333 --> 00:29.067
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT THAT GUY
ANYMORE.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.333
- NO?
- NO.

00:30.367 --> 00:32.567
HONESTLY, YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE THAT GUY ANYMORE.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.600
LOOK, LOOK HOW MUCH
I'VE CHANGED.

00:34.633 --> 00:36.467
- DID I EVER
DRESS LIKE THIS?
- NO.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.567
- YOUR SHIRT'S TUCKED IN.
- I'M TUCKING IN.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.233
- YOU'VE GOT REAL SHOES ON.
- SHOES, SLACKS.

00:41.267 --> 00:44.067
YOU LOOK LIKE
A REAL PERSON,

00:44.100 --> 00:47.433
- NOT AN EIGHTH-GRADER
WITH SILLY SHOES.
- YEAH.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.733
I USED TO WALK
AROUND IN SNEAKERS
LIKE AN EIGHTH-GRADER.

00:49.767 --> 00:53.267
I HAVE TO SAY,
I LOVE THE NEW LARRY.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.233
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

00:55.267 --> 00:56.767
- YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANNA DO?
- HMM?

00:56.800 --> 00:58.567
I WANT TO TRAVEL
WITH YOU--

00:58.600 --> 01:00.200
A LITTLE TRAVELING
IN EUROPE MAYBE,

01:00.233 --> 01:02.633
YOU KNOW, BICYCLES--
ALL THAT STUFF YOU
WANTED TO DO...

01:02.667 --> 01:04.400
- YEAH.
- ...THAT YOU USED TO
ASK ME ABOUT,

01:04.433 --> 01:06.900
AND "NO NO,
I DON'T WANNA DO THAT;

01:06.933 --> 01:09.067
THERE'S NO GOLF COURSES
NEARBY..."

01:09.067 --> 01:11.500
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT GOLF ANYMORE.

01:11.533 --> 01:13.300
I JUST WANT
TO BE WITH YOU.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.367
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
AND I KNOW YOU LOVE
SCUBA DIVING.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.767
I NEVER DID THAT WITH YOU.
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO GO
SCUBA DIVING.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.367
- I KNOW.
- YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
SEE UNDERWATER

01:23.400 --> 01:26.100
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW...
BUT WHATEVER,

01:26.133 --> 01:29.967
I'LL FEEL AROUND
FOR THE FISH, YOU KNOW.

01:30.067 --> 01:32.200
WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'VE DONE A LOT
OF REFLECTING.

01:32.233 --> 01:34.933
I'M A COMPLETELY
CHANGED MAN.

01:34.967 --> 01:37.267
THE ONLY VESTIGE
OF MY OLD SELF

01:37.300 --> 01:40.300
IS THAT I'VE STILL GOT
THE GOOD BREATH,
YOU KNOW.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.700
THAT'S THE THING
YOU'RE KEEPING?

01:41.733 --> 01:44.467
THE NEW LARRY'S KEEPING
THE MINTY BREATH, YEAH.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.533
THE OLD LARRY
YOU'RE GETTING RID OF?

01:46.567 --> 01:48.967
HE'S OVER.
HE'S OVER.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.900
YOU KNOW, HE HATED
YOUR SISTER...

01:51.933 --> 01:53.367
HE DID?

01:56.767 --> 01:58.633
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET THAT LARRY.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.767
HE'S DEAD.
HE'S DEAD.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.867
HE'S COMPLETELY DEAD.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.733
ANYWAY,

02:04.767 --> 02:07.567
IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.433
IT IS GOOD
TO SEE YOU TOO.

02:09.467 --> 02:12.400
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE
THAT YOU'RE--

02:12.433 --> 02:15.133
- REALLY?
- --THAT YOU'RE TRYING.
IT IS.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.867
- I REALLY AM TRYING.
- I KNOW.
I CAN SEE THAT.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.633
- I REALLY AM.
- I KNOW.

02:20.667 --> 02:23.200
HEY, LET'S GO TO THE MOVIES
TOMORROW NIGHT--

02:23.233 --> 02:25.467
MOVIES, DINNER.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.733
COME ON,
I'LL TAKE YOU OUT
TO DINNER.

02:27.767 --> 02:31.667
UM, I WOULD LOVE TO GO
TO THE MOVIES AND DINNER.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.300
REALLY?

02:33.333 --> 02:34.800
LET ME JUST TALK
TO MY THERAPIST

02:34.833 --> 02:36.833
AND SEE WHAT SHE
HAS TO SAY FIRST.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.067
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
SHE FEELS GOOD

02:42.067 --> 02:43.567
- ABOUT THAT.
- MM-HMM.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.433
I'LL CALL MY THERAPIST
AND SEE WHAT SHE SAYS
AND I'LL CALL YOU.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.267
GREAT.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.767
HEY, HOW MUCH
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO TIP
THE BARTENDER, BY THE WAY?

02:50.800 --> 02:53.267
DON'T THEY MAKE
TOO MUCH MONEY? I MEAN,
EVERYBODY BUYS A DRINK.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.667
THEY GET, WHAT,
20% OF EVERY DRINK?

02:55.700 --> 02:57.233
THAT'S INSANE, ISN'T IT?

02:57.267 --> 02:59.267
WELL, THEY WORK
REALLY HARD.

03:01.067 --> 03:05.067
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S GOOD.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.533
THEY'RE ON THEIR FEET
ALL NIGHT,

03:07.567 --> 03:11.367
SO WHATEVER.
WHATEVER THEY MAKE--
GOOD FOR THEM.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.767
THEY WORK HARD,
YOU KNOW.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.967
Larry:
IT COULD NOT
HAVE GONE BETTER.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.500
IT WAS AMAZING.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.233
I SHOWED UP IN--
YOU KNOW,

03:21.267 --> 03:23.133
I WAS TUCKED IN,
I HAD SHOES ON.

03:23.167 --> 03:25.067
SHE NEVER LIKES
THE WAY I DRESS,

03:25.067 --> 03:27.400
BUT SHE NOTICED
THE TUCKED-IN

03:27.433 --> 03:29.300
AND SHE WAS VERY
IMPRESSED WITH THAT.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.100
I LOOKED LIKE A MAN,
YOU KNOW.

03:31.133 --> 03:33.467
THIS IS GREAT STUFF.
IT'S GREAT PROGRESS.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.467
- YEAH.
- I HAVE TO SAY,
IT'S NOT SURPRISING,

03:36.500 --> 03:38.867
BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO THINK
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.967
AND, OH, I SAID--
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
THE FUTURE--

03:41.067 --> 03:42.767
IF WE GET BACK TOGETHER,
WHAT I WANT TO DO:

03:42.800 --> 03:44.733
I WANT TO TRAVEL
WITH HER,

03:44.767 --> 03:47.133
YOU KNOW, ON BICYCLES.

03:47.167 --> 03:49.700
SCUBA DIVING--
IN A ZILLION YEARS
WOULDN'T I GO,

03:49.733 --> 03:52.067
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULD DO IT WITH HER.
I REALLY WOULD.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.067
BE ENTHUSIASTIC,
BUT DON'T MAKE

03:54.100 --> 03:56.333
ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES
THAT YOU CAN'T FULFILL.

03:56.367 --> 03:57.600
THAT'S MY OWN
PERSONAL ADVICE.

03:57.633 --> 04:00.900
GEEZ, I SAID A LOT
OF STUFF LAST NIGHT.

04:00.933 --> 04:02.700
LET'S DEAL WITH THAT
WHEN IT ARISES.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.100
OH, I MIGHT BE
BICYCLING IN FRANCE
IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

04:05.133 --> 04:07.533
AGAIN, LET'S FOCUS
ON THE NEXT STAGE.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.500
WELL, HERE'S THE THING:
I ASKED HER

04:09.533 --> 04:12.833
TO GO TO THE MOVIES
TONIGHT, OKAY?

04:12.867 --> 04:14.533
AND THE THERAPIST
GAVE HER THE GREEN LIGHT,

04:14.567 --> 04:17.067
SO WE'RE GOING
TO DINNER AND A MOVIE,

04:17.100 --> 04:19.333
OR A MOVIE AND A DINNER,
DEPENDING ON THE
STARTING TIME.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.167
SOMETIMES IT WORKS OUT
YOU GO TO A DINNER
AND A MOVIE,

04:21.200 --> 04:22.967
SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER
TO HAVE DINNER
AFTER THE MOVIE,

04:23.067 --> 04:24.867
- SO YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.
- MOVIE, DINNER.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.900
LET'S NOT EVEN WASTE TIME
TALKING ABOUT THAT.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.233
- MOVIE, DINNER.
- MOVIE, DINNER.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.067
SO YOU TAKE HERTO A MOVIE--

04:30.100 --> 04:31.767
AFTER YOU DO THE MOVIE,
JUST REACH OVER,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.367
GRAB HER HAND,
HOLD IT TENDERLY

04:34.400 --> 04:36.933
AND TELL HER,
"I LOVE YOU."

04:37.967 --> 04:39.667
REALLY?

04:39.700 --> 04:42.067
- WHISPER INTO HER EAR,
"I LOVE YOU."
- OKAY.

04:42.067 --> 04:43.867
AT THAT POINT
SHE'S FEELING VULNERABLE.

04:43.900 --> 04:47.067
AND THEN AT DINNER--
THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO
UP THE STAKES.

04:47.067 --> 04:49.733
THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE
TO TELL HER YOU WANT HER
TO MOVE BACK IN WITH YOU

04:49.767 --> 04:52.600
AND SHE HAS UNTIL MONDAY
TO DECIDE,

04:52.633 --> 04:55.467
OR THAT'S IT.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.367
IT WORKS.THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

04:59.067 --> 05:02.633
WOW.
WOW.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.367
SHE MIGHT NOT LIKE IT
AT FIRST,

05:04.400 --> 05:06.400
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY,

05:06.433 --> 05:08.967
IS THAT THE GUY
WHO JUST SAID THAT
IS A PUSSY.

05:10.467 --> 05:12.733
NO ONE LIKES A PUSSY.

05:12.767 --> 05:15.267
WHAT, YOU'RE GETTING
A LOT OF PUSSY FROM ME?

05:15.300 --> 05:18.733
NOT AN AMOUNT
THAT IS NOT MANAGEABLE.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.733
THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO SAY,

05:20.767 --> 05:22.767
"MONDAY IS
THE CUTOFF POINT:

05:22.800 --> 05:25.500
EITHER WE'RE BACK ON,
MOVE BACK IN,

05:25.533 --> 05:27.300
OR MONDAY-- WHEW."

05:27.333 --> 05:30.367
OKAY OKAY.
I THINK I GOT IT.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.833
ALTHOUGH I GOTTA SAY,

05:31.867 --> 05:34.633
BEING A PUSSY
REALLY WASN'T
MY PROBLEM WITH HER.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.600
IT WAS MORE THE FACT
THAT I WAS SELFISH

05:36.633 --> 05:38.433
- AND KIND OF THOUGHTLESS...
- WE HAVE TO STOP.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.067
OH, OKAY.

05:43.700 --> 05:46.300
HUH.
I THOUGHT I HAD...

05:46.333 --> 05:48.067
WE HAVE TO STOP.

05:49.833 --> 05:52.700
GO, WHEW--
GO GET 'EM.

05:52.733 --> 05:54.433
Larry: OKAY.

05:54.467 --> 05:57.200
- ( romantic music playing )
- Man onscreen: Je t'aime.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.067
( continues
speaking French )

06:00.433 --> 06:02.433
Woman:
Je t'aime aussi...

06:02.467 --> 06:04.567
( continues
speaking French )

06:23.533 --> 06:25.467
( whispers )
I LOVE YOU.

06:38.533 --> 06:41.267
Cheryl: I GOTTA TELL YA,
THE NEW LARRY IS REALLY
WORKING FOR ME.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.233
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, OKAY?

06:43.267 --> 06:46.200
THE NEW LARRY CAN REALLY
MAKE YOU HAPPY.

06:46.233 --> 06:49.167
I REALLY CAN.
I KNOW I CAN.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.100
JUST THE IDEA OF YOU
WANTING ME TO BE HAPPY

06:51.133 --> 06:53.267
IS AMAZING.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.867
NOT JUST HAPPY,
BUT REALLY, LIKE,
DELIRIOUS.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.433
- DELIRIOUS?
- DELIRIOUS.

06:58.467 --> 07:01.600
- CHERYL: HI.
- WHAT A SURPRISE!

07:01.633 --> 07:03.967
IS THIS
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

07:04.067 --> 07:06.067
WELL, WE'RE JUST...

07:06.067 --> 07:08.200
- HAVING DINNER.
- ...HAVING DINNER, TALKING.

07:08.233 --> 07:11.100
THIS IS
ONE GREAT PICTURE.

07:11.133 --> 07:13.133
I LOVE IT.

07:14.567 --> 07:15.967
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU GUYS.

07:16.067 --> 07:17.600
HEY, CAN I ASK YOU

07:17.633 --> 07:21.467
NAN'S DAD DAN

07:36.100 --> 07:37.933
IT'S WORTH IT,
BELIEVE ME.

07:37.967 --> 07:39.400
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT ALZHEIMER'S IS.

07:39.433 --> 07:41.300
- HE'S GOT IT BAD.
- REALLY?

07:41.333 --> 07:42.767
WHAT DOES HE DO?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.800
HE RUNS AROUND THE HOUSE
ALL DAY NAKED,

07:44.833 --> 07:46.800
CHASING HIMSELF,
PLAYING TAG.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.433
- IT'S AWFUL.
- REALLY TLY?

07:48.467 --> 07:50.533
HE SCREAMS AT THE CAT
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T VOTE.

07:50.567 --> 07:52.667
WOW.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.167
EVERY TIME HE FARTS,
HE CALLS THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.533
JUST SIGN IT, PLEASE.
DON'T MAKE ME BEG YOU.

07:58.567 --> 08:00.567

COME ON, WHAT IS IT?

08:23.133 --> 08:26.300
I KNOW, BUT I FEEL LIKE
USUALLY YOU WOULD COMPLAIN

08:26.333 --> 08:29.433
OR, I DON'T KNOW,
GIVE HIM A HARD TIME, BUT...

08:29.467 --> 08:31.333
- OLD LARRY.
- I KNOW.

08:31.367 --> 08:34.067
I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

08:34.100 --> 08:36.967
HONEY, I AM
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.133
I'M SO DIFFERENT.

LISTEN...

08:46.733 --> 08:49.233
I WANT YOU

08:57.500 --> 09:00.667
YEAH, MONDAY.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.667
THEN THE OFFER'S
OFF THE TABLE.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.700
( harrumphs )

09:06.733 --> 09:09.167
YOU'RE GIVING ME
AN ULTIMATUM?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.767
WHAT...?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.633
- OH MY GOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
- OH, OKAY.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.567
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WAIT TILL MONDAY.
- OKAY, SO...

09:14.600 --> 09:16.867
- GUESS WHAT?
THE ANSWER IS NO.
- OKAY, THERE'S NO ULTIMATUM.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.367
- YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO CHANGE, LARRY.
- TAKE YOUR TIME.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.600
- YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO IDEA.
- TAKE A MONTH, I DON'T CARE.

09:21.633 --> 09:23.567
- DON'T CALL ME,
PLEASE, EVER.
- WHAT?

09:23.600 --> 09:24.900
NO!

09:26.100 --> 09:28.433
HEY, CHERYL.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.467

TOLD ME TO SAY THAT.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.700
- OH, REALLY?
- I WANT YOU TO MOVE IN.
I DO LOVE YOU.

09:34.733 --> 09:36.733
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?
I THOUGHT THE NEW LARRY
DIDN'T LIE.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.767
- I'M NOT LYING.
- OH, REALLY?

09:38.800 --> 09:41.267
THE THERAPIST SAID THAT.
HE GAVE ME THE DEADLINE.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.300
I'M SO STUPID.
I WAS ACTUALLY
BELIEVING YOU.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.167
NO, BELIEVE ME.
THAT WAS ALL TRUE,

09:45.200 --> 09:46.867
EXCEPT FOR
THE DEADLINE PART.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.900
THE THERAPIST TOLD ME
TO SAY THAT.

09:48.933 --> 09:50.400
CHERYL!

09:50.433 --> 09:53.200
BUT THE DEADLINE--

09:53.233 --> 09:55.500
AGH! AGH!

09:55.533 --> 09:57.833
AGH-HH!

09:59.133 --> 10:01.100
OH.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.800
YOU RUINED MY LIFE.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.967
YOU RUINED
MY LIFE, OKAY?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.500
- OKAY.
- GIVE HER AN ULTIMATUM?

10:08.533 --> 10:11.033
- WHOA, OKAY.
- WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?

10:11.067 --> 10:14.133
- I WAS
THIS CLOSE, THIS CLOSE!
- LARRY, YOU'RE ANGRY.

10:14.167 --> 10:15.667
SHE'S GONE.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.133
IT'S A SETBACK.
IT'S A SETBACK.

10:18.167 --> 10:20.867
I TOLD YOU SHE WASN'T
BOTHERED BY THE HIGH
PUSSY PERCENTAGE,

10:20.900 --> 10:23.167
- BUT YOU DIDN'T
LISTEN TO ME.
- WE RAN OUT OF TIME.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.033
I HAD TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE
WHO WAS SUICIDAL.

10:27.067 --> 10:29.867
YOU KNOW WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW?
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO HER HOUSE

10:29.900 --> 10:32.467
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL HER
THAT THE WHOLE THING
WAS YOUR IDEA.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.900
OKAY, LET'S HAVE
A SESSION.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.867
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE A SESSION.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.900
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL HER
THAT YOU TOLD ME TO GIVE HER
THAT STUPID ULTIMATUM.

10:38.933 --> 10:41.267
( doorbell rings )

10:42.900 --> 10:43.933
LARRY?

10:43.967 --> 10:45.867
SORRY FOR POPPING IN
ON YOU LIKE THIS.

10:45.900 --> 10:49.533
- HELLO, I'M DR. BRIGHT.
- THIS IS MY THERAPIST.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.333
- HI, I'M CHERYL.
- COULD WE COME IN

10:51.367 --> 10:53.200
- AND TALK TO YOU
FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES?
- LARRY...

10:53.233 --> 10:54.833
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.067
I GUESS SO.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.067
COME ON IN.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.433
THANKS.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.700
WOW.

11:08.733 --> 11:10.500
YOU'RE ON THE OCEAN?

11:10.533 --> 11:11.700
YEAH.

11:11.733 --> 11:13.767
WOW, THIS IS...

11:13.800 --> 11:16.433
THESE PLACES ARE EXPENSIVE,
ON THE WATER, AREN'T THEY?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.500
MY THERAPIST SAID

11:18.533 --> 11:21.233
THAT I SHOULD DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR MYSELF,

11:21.267 --> 11:23.433
SORT OF A LOVE-ME GIFT.

11:23.467 --> 11:25.100
AND I DECIDED,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:25.133 --> 11:27.100
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO LIVE ON THE BEACH.

11:27.133 --> 11:29.200
I CAN DO IT NOW,
SO...

11:29.233 --> 11:31.600
- VERY GOOD ADVICE.
- YEAH.

11:31.633 --> 11:33.567
OH, YOU THINK SO?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.533
MM.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.067
I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU TELLING ME TO GET
ANY LOVE-ME GIFTS.

11:38.067 --> 11:40.233
- WE WERE MOVING ONTO THAT
AT SOME POINT.
- OH, REALLY?

11:40.267 --> 11:42.633
- WE WOULD HAVE
ARRIVED AT THAT.
- OH, INTERESTING.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.433
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS
NEED TO TELL ME?

11:45.467 --> 11:48.133
- GO AHEAD, BRIGHT.
- OKAY.

11:48.167 --> 11:51.667
I GAVE LARRY
SOME FLAWED ADVICE.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.467
I TOLD LARRY
TO GIVE YOU
AN ULTIMATUM.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.067
HE TOLD ME
TO SAY THAT.

11:55.067 --> 11:56.733
YOU TOLD HIM
TO SAY THAT?

11:56.767 --> 11:59.667
YEAH, BECAUSE THE PICTURE
THAT WAS PAINTED OF YOU

11:59.700 --> 12:01.700
WAS NOT THE PERSON
I'M SEEING--

12:01.733 --> 12:04.267
- WHAT?
- WELL, NO NO NO.
I MEAN THAT YOU--

12:04.300 --> 12:06.367
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:06.400 --> 12:07.833
I THINK--
I DON'T KNOW.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.900
I JUST HAD--
IT MEANS NOTHING.

12:09.933 --> 12:11.367
- WHAT DID YOU THINK?
- I THOUGHT MAYBE

12:11.400 --> 12:13.767
YOU WERE THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO WOULD LIKE AN ULTIMATUM.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.767
- AND YOU'RE NOT, CLEARLY.
- WHAT KIND OF PICTURE ARE
YOU PAINTING OF ME?

12:16.800 --> 12:19.100
JUST A LOVING
PORTRAYAL.

12:19.133 --> 12:21.300
IT WAS--
IT WAS A DEEPLY
LOVING PORTRAYAL.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.667
BUT-- BUT--

12:22.700 --> 12:24.433
WHAT HAVE I BEEN SAYING
ABOUT HER?

12:24.467 --> 12:26.833
YOU DIDN'T DESCRIBE HER
PHYSICALLY--

12:26.867 --> 12:28.700
SO I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE.

12:28.733 --> 12:31.467
THAT'S WHY
I'M JUST SAYING, WHOO!
I'M JUST IMPRESSED.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.067
WHY WOULD IT MATTER WHAT
SOMEBODY LOOKS LIKE
PHYSICALLY--

12:34.100 --> 12:38.567
- WHAT KIND OF ADVICE--?
- BECAUSE YOU GET THE FACE
YOU DESERVE, RIGHT?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.533
THE FACE TELLS A STORY.

12:40.567 --> 12:42.533
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
THE POINT IS,

12:42.567 --> 12:45.467
YOU GET AN IDEA
OF THE PERSON WHO I'VE BEEN
LISTENING TO HERE?

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
- IS IT COMING THROUGH
TO YOU?
- YEAH.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.800
SO YOU TOLD LARRY
TO GIVE ME AN ULTIMATUM.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.167
FINE, OKAY.
NOW I KNOW THAT.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.233
- OKAY?
- HE IS TO BLAME.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.233
I'M 90% TO BLAME
FOR EVERYTHING.

12:55.267 --> 12:58.467
90%?
I THINK 100%.
100% TO BLAME.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.533
WELL, I'M TAKING
A LION'S SHARE.

13:00.567 --> 13:03.167
NO, TAKE MORE
THAN A LION'S SHARE.
TAKE THE WHOLE SHARE.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.100
TAKE IT ALL.

13:05.133 --> 13:07.367
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
NO, THAT'S FAIR.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.467
YEAH, I'M 100% TO BLAME.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.467
I TOLD LARRY
TO DO THE--

13:11.500 --> 13:13.233
TO HOLD YOUR HAND,
TO SAY, "I LOVE YOU."

13:13.267 --> 13:15.733
- THE NEW LARRY--
IT'S ALL ME.
- ALL RIGHT, NO NO NO.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.333
THE NEW LARRY IS YOU?

13:17.367 --> 13:19.267
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

13:19.300 --> 13:21.500
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE NEW LARRY.

13:21.533 --> 13:23.433
I'M THE NEW--
YOU DIDN'T MAKE
THE NEW LARRY.

13:23.467 --> 13:24.933
YOU TOLD ME
TO TAKE 100%.

13:24.967 --> 13:26.767
I INVENTED THE NEW LARRY,
NOT YOU.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.533
WHAT ABOUT TUCKING IN
THE T-SHIRT?

13:28.567 --> 13:30.433
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME--
YOU TOLD ME TO TUCK IN?

13:30.467 --> 13:32.700
ALL RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

13:32.733 --> 13:35.067
I'M GOING TO TALK
TO DR. SALVIN

13:35.067 --> 13:36.767
AND FIGURE IT OUT,
SO THANKS.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.900
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

13:38.933 --> 13:40.967
ALL RIGHT,
THANKS FOR COMING,
I GUESS.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.533
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
CREDIT FOR NEW LARRY?

13:42.567 --> 13:44.067
I LAID THE FOUNDATION
FOR NEW LARRY.

13:44.067 --> 13:45.967
BULLSHIT--
YOU LAID FOUNDATION.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.733
YOU'RE A MORON.
HOW COULD YOU SUGGEST
SUCH A THING?

13:50.767 --> 13:52.433
IT'S NOT
AN EXACT SCIENCE.

13:52.467 --> 13:54.833
- AND I MEAN...
- Jeff: CLEARLY.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.667
I MEAN, THAT IS
UNBELIEVABLE,
SERIOUSLY.

13:57.700 --> 14:00.067
THE THING ABOUT IT
IS THAT...

14:00.067 --> 14:03.567
SHE DOESN'T MAKE A MOVE NOW
IN HER LIFE

14:03.600 --> 14:05.667
UNLESS HER THERAPIST
TELLS HER.

14:05.700 --> 14:09.067
BUT THE THERAPIST
DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ME.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.067
- I'M NOT REPRESENTED THERE.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.900
- IF THE THERAPIST
KNEW ME, OKAY?
- Bright: MM.

14:14.933 --> 14:17.600
IF THE THERAPIST THOUGHT
I WAS A TERRIFIC GUY,

14:17.633 --> 14:19.800
- THERE WOULD BE
A COUNTERARGUMENT TO IT.
- RIGHT.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.700
HOW DO YOU GET TO HER?

14:27.900 --> 14:29.467
I GOT IT.
LET'S GO.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.567
COME ON.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.933
- COME ON, BRIGHT.
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

14:33.967 --> 14:36.300
SO YOU JUMP OUT,

14:36.333 --> 14:38.600
YOU GRABTHE THERAPIST'S PURSE.

14:38.633 --> 14:40.633
THEN I COME
OUT OF NOWHERE,

14:40.667 --> 14:43.533
I TACKLE YOU,
TAKE YOU DOWN,

14:43.567 --> 14:45.433
GET THE PURSEFROM YOU.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.433
YOU RUN OFF,
YOU GET YOURSELF

14:47.467 --> 14:49.833
A CUP OF COFFEE,
A PIECE OF PIZZA.

14:49.867 --> 14:52.067
AND I RETURN
THE HANDBAG

14:52.100 --> 14:56.567
AND I'M LIKE A GOD,
YOU KNOW.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.267
PSHH, I'LL DO THAT SHIT.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.767
- YEAH. YEAH.
- I'LL DO IT.
WHAT THE FUCK?

15:00.800 --> 15:02.167
YOU'RE MY MOTHERFUCKING MAN,
LARRY.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.833
IS HE THE GREATEST?
ARE YOU THE GREATEST, MAN?

15:04.867 --> 15:06.933
- WHAT'S UP?
THAT'S HOW WE DO IT, YO.
- YOU ARE THE GREATEST.

15:06.967 --> 15:08.200
THAT'S HOW WE
FUCKING DO IT.

15:08.233 --> 15:09.733
I WALK BY,
I GRAB THE FUCKING PURSE.

15:09.767 --> 15:11.800
I RUN DOWN THE STREET,
LARRY POPS THE FUCK OUT,

15:11.833 --> 15:13.600
TACKLES ME,
TRIES TO GET
THE PURSE BACK.

15:13.633 --> 15:15.633
I FUCK LARRY UP,
I KEEP ON ROLLING.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.533
YOU--

15:17.567 --> 15:19.133
SOMEBODY GOTTA GET
FUCKED UP, LARRY, RIGHT?

15:19.167 --> 15:21.833
YOU DON'T NEED TO--
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
FUCK ME UP?

15:21.867 --> 15:24.500
WHEN YOU TACKLE ME
I AIN'T GOING TO LOOK LIKE
A FUCKING BITCH AND SHIT,

15:24.533 --> 15:25.933
- LET YOU FUCK ME UP.
- NO. I TACKLE YOU

15:25.967 --> 15:27.967
AND THEN YOU RUN AWAY.
YOU RUN AWAY.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.333
THE MORE FUCKED UP YOU ARE,
THE MORE OF A HERO
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE.

15:30.367 --> 15:32.533
I'M GOING TO BREAK
YOUR FUCKING TEETH,
YOUR GLASSES OR SOMETHING.

15:32.567 --> 15:34.733
LEON, I DON'T NEED TO LOOK
LIKE THAT MUCH OF A HERO.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.067
JUST STOPPING YOU
AND GIVING HER HER PURSE
BACK'S ENOUGH.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.933
THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT SHIT
HALF-SPEED.

15:38.967 --> 15:41.133
IT'S NOT REALISTIC, LARRY,
IF I DON'T FUCK YOU UP.

15:41.167 --> 15:44.700
- HEY, WHO'S THIS?
- HELLO, I'M DR. BRIGHT.

15:44.733 --> 15:47.767
THAT'S MY THERAPIST
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.833
- OH, IS THIS
MR. ULTIMATUM?
- YEAH.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.867
YO, MAN, THAT IDEA
YOU CAME UP WITH
WAS AWFUL.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.400
SO WHAT'S
GOING ON, L.D.?

15:55.433 --> 15:57.867
NOTHING.
NOTHING REALLY.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.067
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT'S HAPPENING, LEON?

16:01.833 --> 16:04.867
- LARRY WANTS ME
TO MUG SOMEBODY.
- WHO? WHO?

16:04.900 --> 16:07.133
- YEAH, BUT IT'S
A PRETEND MUGGING.
- IT'S PRETEND.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.500
IT'S ALL FOR FUN.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.433
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GOING ALONG WITH THAT.

16:10.467 --> 16:13.133
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA
GET HURT. I'MA GRAB
THE FUCKING PURSE...

16:13.167 --> 16:15.300

AND TRY TO STOP ME,

16:15.333 --> 16:18.300
- I'MA FUCK LARRY UP...
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FUCK ME UP.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.733
- YOU DONE LOST
YOUR MIND, LEON.
- YOU DONE LOST YOUR MIND.

16:20.767 --> 16:25.067
( all yelling )

16:25.067 --> 16:28.067
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT:
HE'S NOT DOING IT!

16:28.067 --> 16:29.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:29.533 --> 16:31.700
THIS PASTY-ASS MOTHERFUCKER
GOT YOU INTO IT.

16:31.733 --> 16:33.700
HAVE HIM GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF IT.

16:37.733 --> 16:39.700
SHE'S RIGHT.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.700
I'LL DO IT.

16:41.733 --> 16:44.133
EH, FUCK IT.

16:47.667 --> 16:50.067
THERE'S HER THERAPIST.

16:50.067 --> 16:52.600
OKAY OKAY, THAT'S HER.
YOU SEE HER?

16:52.633 --> 16:54.333
( giggles )
YEAH, OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT IS THIS?

16:56.233 --> 16:58.600
YOU LOOK LIKE A RAPIST
WITH THAT THING ON.
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

16:58.633 --> 17:00.433
YOU KNOW WHAT?
PUT THE HOOD UP.

17:00.467 --> 17:02.300
ISN'T THAT A CLICHE?

17:02.333 --> 17:04.067
- IT'S NOT A CLICHE.
PUT THE HOOD UP.
- ALL RIGHT.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.500
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
WHAT?

17:06.533 --> 17:08.433
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T DO IT.

17:08.467 --> 17:09.700
( arguing )

17:09.733 --> 17:11.867
GO DO IT.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.633
- GIVE ME YOUR BAG.
I'M MUGGING YOU.
- NO. NO.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.067
I GOT IT!
I GOT IT!

17:16.067 --> 17:18.767
- ( Larry yelling )
- OH MY GOD.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.667
- ( both grunting )
- OH MY GOD.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.333
NOW RUN!

17:25.367 --> 17:26.833
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'D BETTER RUN!

17:26.867 --> 17:28.933
OH MY...

17:28.967 --> 17:30.833
- ( siren whoops )
- HERE YOU ARE.

17:30.867 --> 17:32.900
THANK YOU.

17:32.933 --> 17:35.300
THAT WAS AMAZING.
YOU CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

17:35.333 --> 17:37.333
- MA'AM, ARE YOU OKAY?
- I DIDN'T EVEN SEE YOU.

17:37.367 --> 17:40.133
YEAH, WE'RE--
WE'RE OKAY.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.667
DO WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.933
HOW DID YOU--
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

17:44.967 --> 17:47.133
I NEVER EVEN SAW YOU--

17:47.167 --> 17:50.200
WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO?
I SAW THAT

17:50.233 --> 17:53.067
AND I HAD
TO DO SOMETHING.

17:53.067 --> 17:55.067
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I JUST WITNESSED.

17:55.067 --> 17:56.900
THANK YOU
FROM THE BOTTOM
OF MY HEART.

17:56.933 --> 17:58.433
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.867
YOU TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOURSELF, OKAY?

18:00.900 --> 18:02.667
THANK YOU.
I'M A LITTLE SHAKEN.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.667
SHAKE IT OFF.
GO GET YOURSELF
A DRINK OR SOMETHING.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.067
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

18:06.100 --> 18:10.467
WAIT, I NEVER EVEN
ASKED YOUR NAME.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.833
IT'S LARRY--

18:15.867 --> 18:18.233
LARRY DAVID.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.700
LARRY DAVID?

18:24.267 --> 18:27.067
VERY FUNNY.
SPREAD YOUR LEGS.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.733
THAT WAS AMAZING.
I MEAN, THE WAY
YOU SWEPT IN

18:29.767 --> 18:32.133
AND TOOK CONTROL--
THAT DIDN'T SEEM REAL.

18:32.167 --> 18:35.200
IT WAS REAL.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

18:35.233 --> 18:37.267
I'M STILL
A LITTLE SHAKY,
I GUESS.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.733
- IT'S TO BE EXPECTED.
MY GOD.
- THAT GUY--

18:40.767 --> 18:43.567
- THAT STRANGE,
HORRIBLE MAN...
- HORRIBLE.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.300
BUT YOU WERE JUST LIKE
CLINT EASTWOOD.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.400
I MEAN, YOU JUST
SWEPT IN THERE AND...

18:49.433 --> 18:52.133
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING THAT BRAVE.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.167
EH, PLEASE, REALLY.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.233
I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK TWICE ABOUT IT.

18:56.267 --> 18:59.167
THE ONLY THING I DID
THINK ABOUT FOR A SECOND
WAS MY GLASSES,

18:59.200 --> 19:01.667
BUT THAT'S IT--
ONLY THE SAFETY
OF MY GLASSES.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.267
'CAUSE THESE ARE
IRREPLACEABLE.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.600
WHAT DO YOU DO,
MAY I ASK?

19:06.633 --> 19:08.700
OH, I'M A THERAPIST.

19:08.733 --> 19:10.300
- YOU'RE A THERAPIST?
- YES.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.800
OH, BOY, I COULD REALLY
USE A THERAPIST MYSELF.

19:12.833 --> 19:16.500
MY WIFE LEFT ME
AFTER A LONG TIME AND--

19:16.533 --> 19:18.967
I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER YOU
WITH ALL THIS, YOU KNOW.

19:19.067 --> 19:21.067
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
PLEASE.

19:21.067 --> 19:24.533
WELL, MY WIFE
LEFT THE HOUSE RECENTLY

19:24.567 --> 19:27.433
AND IT'S BEEN
QUITE DEVAS--

19:27.467 --> 19:30.067
- I'M SURE IT'S--
- IT'S BEEN QUITE
DEVASTATING FOR ME,

19:30.067 --> 19:31.500
BUT ANYWAY...

19:31.533 --> 19:32.967
- I'M SORRY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.433
BUT I FEEL LIKE
SHE NEVER REALLY

19:35.467 --> 19:37.667
HAD ANY IDEA
WHO I WAS.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.667
ALL THIS TIME,
ALL THESE YEARS,

19:39.700 --> 19:41.933
I REALLY HID
THE REAL ME,

19:41.967 --> 19:45.800
THE ME WHO SAVES PEOPLE.

19:45.833 --> 19:48.600
AND, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE BEEN DOING THAT
MOST OF MY LIFE.

19:48.633 --> 19:50.767
YOU KNOW, I GAVE
A KIDNEY TO MY FRIEND...

19:50.800 --> 19:52.633
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.167
WHY WOULD YOU?

19:54.200 --> 19:57.800
NO, I WOULDN'T.
I JUST--

19:57.833 --> 20:00.367
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I GOTTA GO.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.067
YOU ARE
SUCH A GOOD PERSON.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.600
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

20:05.633 --> 20:07.533
- AM I?
- OH...

20:07.567 --> 20:09.167
YES.

20:10.867 --> 20:12.900
OKAY.

20:12.933 --> 20:15.033
SO GREAT
TO HAVE MET YOU.

20:15.067 --> 20:16.200
YES.

20:16.233 --> 20:18.200
I'D BETTER GET GOING.

20:21.167 --> 20:22.967
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.267
WELL, THANKS AGAIN.

20:25.300 --> 20:28.333
SO LONG.

20:28.367 --> 20:31.000
GOODBYE, LARRY DAVID.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.100
( gate buzzes )

20:36.133 --> 20:39.300
OH, WOW.
HEY.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.033
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

20:46.067 --> 20:48.700
WELL, I'M IN PRISON.

20:48.733 --> 20:50.767
YEAH. JESUS.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.433
I SPENT THE NIGHT
IN A CELL

20:52.467 --> 20:55.033
THAT'S SMALLER
THAN MY CLOSET.

20:55.067 --> 20:57.833
OH, MAN, OH, MAN.
I'M SO SORRY.

20:57.867 --> 20:59.600
MY FEET STICK OUT
THROUGH THE FUCKING BARS.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.533
- YOUR FEET STICK OUT?
- YEAH, MY FEET STICK OUT.

21:01.567 --> 21:03.667
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN THAT TALL.
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.800
I'M NOT EVEN THAT TALL,
AND MY FUCKING FEET
STICK OUT.

21:05.833 --> 21:07.767
- HOW TALL ARE YOU?
- 5'10".

21:07.800 --> 21:09.167
- YOU'RE 5'10"?
- YEAH.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.367
YOU'RE 5'10"?
STAND UP. LET ME SEE.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.900
- YOU'RE NOT 5'10".
- I'M 5'10", I AM.

21:14.933 --> 21:17.200
WELL, A HAIRSBREADTH
UNDER.

21:17.233 --> 21:19.267
YOU'RE CHEATING A LITTLE BIT.
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE 5'10".

21:19.300 --> 21:21.067
IN THE HEEL, I AM--
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.733
THE POINT IS
I'M SHARING A ROOM

21:22.767 --> 21:25.867
WITH A 300-LB FUCKING GUY
WITH A HAIRY BACK.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.433
SOMETIMES YOU MAKE FRIENDS
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

21:28.467 --> 21:30.333
THEY BECOME
YOUR FRIEND FOR LIFE.

21:30.367 --> 21:32.467
HE DOESN'T
SPEAK ENGLISH.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.200
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

21:35.233 --> 21:38.900
OH, GOOD NEWS:

21:38.933 --> 21:41.333
AFTER YOU WERE
TAKEN AWAY...

21:41.367 --> 21:42.700
UH-HUH.

21:42.733 --> 21:44.833
...THE THERAPIST AND I
WENT TO HAVE COFFEE--

21:44.867 --> 21:47.767
WHEW, THE PLAN WORKED
FANTASTIC.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.867
I'M PRETTY OPTIMISTIC.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:49.900 --> 21:52.700
THANK YOU.
'CAUSE YOU WERE THERE
AT ITS INCEPTION.

21:52.733 --> 21:54.733
YOU PUSHED IT THROUGH.

21:55.767 --> 21:57.767
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU,

21:57.800 --> 22:00.167
BUT IT'S NOT
TOP OF THE LIST OF
MY PRIORITIES RIGHT NOW.

22:00.200 --> 22:03.100
WE'RE GOING TO
GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

22:03.133 --> 22:04.867
DO WE HAVE A TIME FRAME?
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A TIME FRAME?

22:04.900 --> 22:07.667
- 24 HOURS...
- OKAY, I THINK I CAN--

22:07.700 --> 22:10.500
...48 AT THE MOST.

22:10.533 --> 22:13.067
- WHAT'S AFTER 48? 72?
- 72, YEAH.

22:13.100 --> 22:16.333
58, 68--
RIGHT, 72.
AND THEN...

22:16.367 --> 22:17.933
DON'T SAY "AND THEN..."

22:17.967 --> 22:20.333
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 72?
THAT'S BEYOND WHAT--

22:20.367 --> 22:22.200
...96?

22:22.233 --> 22:24.333
PLEASE, LET'S AIM
FOR 24.

22:24.367 --> 22:25.933
YOU GOT
A DECK OF CARDS?

22:25.967 --> 22:27.867
CAN YOU PLAY
SOLITAIRE OR ANYTHING?
WHAT CAN YOU DO HERE?

22:27.900 --> 22:30.367
I DON'T HAVE A DECK OF CARDS,
BUT YES, I DO KNOW HOW
TO PLAY SOLITAIRE.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.700
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT
A DECK OF CARDS. DAMN IT.
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD

22:32.733 --> 22:35.133
TO HAVE A DECK OF CARDS,
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE.

22:35.167 --> 22:38.067
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
JUST GET ME OUT OF
FUCKING PRISON.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.533
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT CARDS.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.267
JUST GET ME OUT OF
FUCKING PRISON, PLEASE.

22:41.300 --> 22:44.067
I'M SORRY,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP.

22:44.067 --> 22:46.633
WE HAVE MORE TIME.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.400
CHERYL'S GETTING OUT
OF HER THERAPY APPOINTMENT

22:48.433 --> 22:49.867
AND I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO HER.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.267
I'VE NOT SPOKEN
TO ANYONE NORMAL
IN 24 HOURS

22:52.300 --> 22:54.100
AND I'M SCARED.

22:54.133 --> 22:56.133
WE HAVE TO STOP.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.833
( whistles a tune )

23:03.867 --> 23:05.833
- Hello?
- OH, HI, CHERYL.

23:05.867 --> 23:07.867
HOW DID YOUR SESSION
GO TODAY?

23:07.900 --> 23:09.967
Larry, I've spoken
to my therapist

23:10.067 --> 23:12.433
and she told me
I shouldn't ever be
speaking to you again.

23:12.467 --> 23:14.500
SHE SAID THAT?

23:14.533 --> 23:16.933
Yeah. I'm sorry,
Larry, really.

23:16.967 --> 23:19.200
ARE YOU KIDDING?

23:19.233 --> 23:21.067
I should go.
I should go.
Goodbye, Larry.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.900
- HEY, CHERYL!
- ( hangs up )

23:35.933 --> 23:37.833
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

23:37.867 --> 23:39.900
EXCUSE ME.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.667
- HEY.
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS:

23:46.700 --> 23:48.700
CHERYL CALLED ME UP,
TOLD ME

23:48.733 --> 23:50.700
THAT HER THERAPIST
URGED HER--

23:50.733 --> 23:52.967
URGED HER
NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN.

23:53.067 --> 23:55.067
THAT MAKES
NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.867
- OH MY GOD.
- HUH?

23:57.900 --> 23:59.333
WHAT?

23:59.367 --> 24:00.733
SHE LIKES ME.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.967
HER THERAPIST LIKES ME.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.667
THAT'S WHY SHE TOLD CHERYL
NOT TO SEE ME.

24:06.700 --> 24:08.633
SHE WANTS ME FOR HERSELF.

24:08.667 --> 24:11.967
- OH MY GOD!
OH MY GOD!
- HUH?

24:12.067 --> 24:14.200
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

24:14.233 --> 24:16.267
IF I REJECT HER,

24:16.300 --> 24:18.267
SHE'LL SAY BAD THINGS
ABOUT ME TO CHERYL.

24:18.300 --> 24:21.433
AND IF I'M NICE TO HER,
SHE'LL THINK I'M INTERESTED.

24:21.467 --> 24:24.233
OH, YOU ARE SCREWED.

24:24.267 --> 24:26.267
I'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF THIS.
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

24:26.300 --> 24:27.967
I THINK YOU'RE FUCKED.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.800
TOMMY!

24:29.833 --> 24:32.400
- IS THAT FUNKHOUSER?
- YEAH.

24:32.433 --> 24:35.700
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE WALKING.

24:35.733 --> 24:37.067
HE'S HAVING
A CUP OF COFFEE?

24:37.067 --> 24:38.533
Jeff: I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.200
HEY.

24:40.233 --> 24:41.767
L.D., HOW ARE
YOU DOING, PAL?

24:41.800 --> 24:43.800
WHERE'S YOUR SHIRT?

24:43.833 --> 24:47.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE WALKING.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.333
I RAISED MONEY.
I DON'T WALK.

24:49.367 --> 24:50.967
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE SITTING.

24:51.067 --> 24:53.500
I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN YOU
MONEY IN THE FIST PLACE.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.267
- I DIDN'T SAY I WAS WALKING.
- THE WALKING'S IMPLIED,
IS IT NOT?

24:56.300 --> 24:58.767
NO, I SAID,
"SPONSOR ME
FOR THE WALKATHON."

24:58.800 --> 25:01.100
OKAY, WALKATHON--
WALK.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.067
WHY DO YOU WANT ME
TO WALK?

25:03.100 --> 25:05.933
YOU TOOK MONEY
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

25:05.967 --> 25:08.267
SO YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S?

25:10.867 --> 25:12.867
ALZHEIMER'S?

25:16.133 --> 25:20.100
YOU WERE DIAGNOSED
WITH ALZHEIMER'S?!

25:20.133 --> 25:21.700
YEAH, AND YOU'RE
THE FIRST PERSON I'VE TOLD.

25:21.733 --> 25:23.633
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.233
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS.

25:25.267 --> 25:28.767
- SO THIS IS JUST
THE VERY EARLIEST ONSET?
- YEAH.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.233
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EARLY.
I'M SORT OF HALFWAY

25:31.267 --> 25:33.467
BETWEEN EARLY AND MIDDLE.
WHAT'S THAT CALLED?

25:33.500 --> 25:35.300
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S
A TERM FOR THAT.

25:35.333 --> 25:38.867
MAYBE I HAVE A QUARTER...?

25:38.900 --> 25:41.067
I HAVE TO
CONFESS SOMETHING.

25:41.067 --> 25:43.533
AFTER WE MET
AND CONNECTED,

25:43.567 --> 25:46.533
I WAS HOPING THAT,
YOU KNOW,

25:46.567 --> 25:49.067
MAYBE THERE WAS
SOME KIND OF FUTURE.

25:49.067 --> 25:53.633
IN THREE TO FIVE YEARS
I'LL BE A VEGETABLE.

25:54.933 --> 25:56.833
LISTEN, YOU HELPED ME
THE OTHER DAY

25:56.867 --> 25:59.167
AND I WANT TO HELP YOU.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.167
I FORGOT YOUR NAME.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.233
YOU MUST GO BACK
WITH YOUR WIFE.

26:04.267 --> 26:07.133
HEARING THIS NEWS--
YOU MUST GO BACK
WITH YOUR WIFE.

26:07.167 --> 26:09.833
OH MY GOD.
YES, I KNOW,
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO?

26:09.867 --> 26:13.500
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

26:13.533 --> 26:16.600
LET'S ORDER.
I'M GETTING HUNGRY.

26:16.633 --> 26:19.133
- WE DID ORDER.
- WE DID?

26:19.167 --> 26:21.233
YEAH, YOU HAD
THE CHICKEN SALAD.

26:21.267 --> 26:24.567
- I ORDERED CHICKEN SALAD?
- YEAH. DO YOU NOT LIKE--?

26:24.600 --> 26:26.867
- I DON'T EVEN LIKE
CHICKEN SALAD.
- OH MY GOD.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.167
- GOD DAMN IT.
- NO NO NO, WE'LL SWITCH.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.833
- EXCUSE ME, DR. SALVIN?
- OH, YES.

26:32.867 --> 26:34.600
I'M DETECTIVE KENNAN,
L.A.P.D.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.933
I TALKED TO YOUR ASSISTANT.
SHE TOLD ME I COULD

26:36.967 --> 26:38.567
FIND YOU HERE
WITH MR. DAVID.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.100
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR PURSE-SNATCHING.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.800
NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU DIDN'T
GET A LOOK AT THE GUY,
BUT THAT YOU DID.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.600
WE ACTUALLY HAVE
THE GUY ALREADY.

26:45.633 --> 26:48.067
I JUST WANT SOME
BASIC INFORMATION
SO WE CAN KEEP HIM.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.533
SO, WHAT DID HE
LOOK LIKE?

26:53.833 --> 26:56.767
I-- I DON'T REMEMBER.

26:57.733 --> 27:00.167
AW, JEEZ.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.500
( gate whirring )

27:09.467 --> 27:12.733
THERE HE IS.
THERE'S MY GUY.

27:12.767 --> 27:15.700
HEY YA, BRIGHT.
HEY YA, BRIGHT BOY.

27:15.733 --> 27:17.233
HUH?

27:17.267 --> 27:19.200
HOW'S IT GOING?

27:19.233 --> 27:20.633
UH, NOT TOO GOOD.

27:20.667 --> 27:23.533
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE DOWN.

27:23.567 --> 27:26.100
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA DO WITH MY LIFE.

27:26.133 --> 27:27.633
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

27:27.667 --> 27:29.667
OH, HEY, GET THIS:

27:29.700 --> 27:32.400
I'M GOING OUT
WITH CHERYL TONIGHT.
I'VE GOT A DATE WITH CHERYL.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.600
- GOOD.
- IT'S FANTASTIC.
I'M SO THRILLED.

27:34.633 --> 27:36.367
COME ON.
I'M PRETTY EXCITED,
BRIGHT.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.067
I THINK
IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT.

27:45.067 --> 27:47.067
( both cheering )

27:47.100 --> 27:49.067
YOU DID IT.
THAT WAS--

27:49.067 --> 27:50.367
THERE YOU GO,
BIG WINNER.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.900
HEY...

27:51.933 --> 27:54.067
THAT IS SO SWEET.
THANK YOU.

27:54.067 --> 27:56.133
- LET'S GO
ON THE FERRIS WHEEL.
- OKAY.

28:00.733 --> 28:03.500
Bright:
IT'S THE MOST BIZARRE
EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE

28:03.533 --> 28:06.367
AND I JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO SPEAK TO ABOUT IT

28:06.400 --> 28:09.400
BECAUSE I CAN'T WORK
AND I CAN'T SLEEP.

28:09.433 --> 28:11.367
AND YOU COME
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.333
WHY DON'T YOU START
FROM THE BEGINNING?

28:15.367 --> 28:18.067
UM, WELL,
ONE OF MY CLIENTS

28:18.067 --> 28:22.200
IS THIS BALD GUY, UM...

28:23.733 --> 28:26.067
I WANT YOU
TO MOVE BACK IN WITH ME.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.500
YOU HAVE TILL MONDAY
TO DECIDE.

28:28.533 --> 28:30.367
OKAY.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.367
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

28:33.533 --> 28:35.400
- I LOVE YOU, LARRY.
- I LOVE YOU.

28:35.433 --> 28:37.467
( phone ringing )

28:39.200 --> 28:41.733
HELLO?

28:41.767 --> 28:51.800
