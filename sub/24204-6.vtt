WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:05.660
Previously on Siren...

00:05.670 --> 00:07.035
Ryn's back.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.417
Why on earth
would she come back?

00:09.420 --> 00:13.413
[Siren song echoing]

00:13.420 --> 00:14.660
We need help.

00:14.670 --> 00:15.739
It's getting worse,
isn't it?

00:15.750 --> 00:17.115
What's happening?

00:17.120 --> 00:18.826
They're starving them out,
Maddie.

00:18.830 --> 00:20.707
The government's
letting it happen.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.325
They're making it happen.

00:22.330 --> 00:25.163
Seems a young woman assaulted
a 250-pound dock worker.

00:25.170 --> 00:26.285
[hissing]

00:26.290 --> 00:28.110
We need the people.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.452
-Them take!
-No. No, no, no, no!

00:30.460 --> 00:31.870
-[Helen] Whoa!
-[hissing]

00:31.880 --> 00:33.916
[both screaming]

00:33.920 --> 00:35.615
-Hey!
-Ryn!

00:35.620 --> 00:38.032
Water! Now!

00:38.040 --> 00:39.029
Any sign of them?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.029
You?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.281
Yes, you can trust me.

00:42.290 --> 00:43.871
This Decker guy.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.031
He's the one we gotta
watch out for.

00:47.040 --> 00:51.454
[singing Siren song]

01:09.540 --> 01:11.201
[doors rattle]

01:15.380 --> 01:16.779
Aah!

01:20.040 --> 01:21.530
[dishes clanking]

01:23.500 --> 01:25.240
-There you go.
-Thank you.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.115
[both laughing]

01:28.380 --> 01:32.282
Maddie, you tell me
story about mother.

01:32.290 --> 01:33.917
That's right.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.876
Your mother is gone.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.871
When Ryn was young,

01:37.880 --> 01:40.110
mother died.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.782
Sister took care
of me always.

01:42.790 --> 01:45.702
But now she is alone.

01:45.710 --> 01:48.281
She's hungry
and frightened.

01:48.290 --> 01:49.575
Ryn.

01:49.580 --> 01:53.698
She will be
out in the night

01:53.710 --> 01:56.247
to find food.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.911
She's hunting?

01:57.920 --> 02:00.821
Yes, she will hunt.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.069
[exhales sharply]

02:35.460 --> 02:37.371
[phone ringing]

02:39.460 --> 02:41.200
[continues ringing]

02:47.670 --> 02:50.241
Officer Montero,
what can I do for you?

02:50.250 --> 02:51.956
[Nina] Just wanted
to give you the heads up, sir,

02:51.960 --> 02:54.372
that the Admiral
was in looking for you.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.371
What'd you tell him?

02:56.380 --> 02:57.950
Nothing.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.076
I got the feeling
you might be following up

03:00.080 --> 03:02.162
on your... suspect,

03:02.170 --> 03:04.616
but noticed that your trip
wasn't on the roster.

03:04.620 --> 03:07.077
Just wanted _
to let you know, snr.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.036
I appreciate
your discretion, Montero.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.371
I'm here to help, sir.

03:12.670 --> 03:15.377
[suspenseful music playing]

04:33.500 --> 04:35.161
[thump]

04:45.540 --> 04:46.746
[wings flapping]

05:07.500 --> 05:09.570
[placid, high-pitched calls]

05:12.380 --> 05:14.200
[Ben] You see this?

05:14.210 --> 05:17.031
The Chronicle called out
Pownall Seafood by name

05:17.040 --> 05:18.450
for overfishing.

05:18.460 --> 05:20.166
[Maddie] Your dad's
gonna love that.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.456
Yeah. Well,
he'll love it even more

05:22.460 --> 05:24.951
when I tell him he's
gotta bring the boats in.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.496
The government's
giving him free rein.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.740
He's not gonna
back down so easily.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.536
Well, I gotta give him
a good reason to.

05:29.540 --> 05:30.666
[hisses]

05:32.250 --> 05:33.410
[Ben] Ryn?

05:33.420 --> 05:34.785
It's gonna be okay.

05:34.790 --> 05:36.667
We're gonna work it out
for you and your sister.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.662
My sister not trust me.

05:39.670 --> 05:42.571
Look, if we show her
we can help your people,

05:42.580 --> 05:44.536
get them the food they need,
she'll change her mind.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.451
We just need
to be careful.

05:46.460 --> 05:49.577
She attacked someone
at the fishery the other night.

05:49.580 --> 05:50.990
The police could be
looking for you.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.878
Yes... Maddie.

05:58.880 --> 06:04.955
All right,
I got one coffee,
sugar and soy.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.169
One fish, head and tail.

06:11.380 --> 06:13.530
-Maddie?
-Love you.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.570
I love you.

06:26.830 --> 06:29.287
Okay, so that just happened.

06:33.290 --> 06:34.996
I got one the other day.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.326
[car starting]

06:48.670 --> 06:50.706
[Helen] Where
did you go last night?

06:50.710 --> 06:54.532
You and your sister have
the same mysterious habits.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.612
She's a bit chattier,
though.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.703
[long, sharp exhalation]

07:05.170 --> 07:08.571
You don't like it here.
I know.

07:08.580 --> 07:10.161
Ryn.

07:10.170 --> 07:12.286
You want to see her?

07:12.290 --> 07:13.575
I can arrange that.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.537
Maybe you can talk
some sense into her.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.241
[Ted] Every fishery
out there's taking advantage

07:30.250 --> 07:31.660
of these lax regulations.

07:31.670 --> 07:32.614
Why they gotta
single us out by name?

07:32.620 --> 07:33.951
It's unbelievable.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.530
We're the biggest.

07:35.540 --> 07:36.666
Of course they're
gonna call us out.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.410
Are you saying it's fair

07:38.420 --> 07:39.569
that we're being portrayed
as the bad guy here?

07:39.580 --> 07:42.413
We are the bad guy here.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.614
But we don't have to be.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.785
What are you sayin'?

07:48.790 --> 07:51.611
Show them that, even
though the government
is lax on conservation,

07:51.620 --> 07:53.668
Pownall Seafood isn't.

07:55.290 --> 07:56.746
That could be a way
to spin this.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.490
No, I'm saying we could
actually do it.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.456
How?

08:01.460 --> 08:03.781
Our product does great
at warehouse groceries,

08:03.790 --> 08:06.247
but we don't sell
to high-end natural markets.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.571
-We're bigger than that.
-You know how much Salmon
we sell to Kroger?

08:08.580 --> 08:10.070
Yes, but do you know
how much a pound

08:10.080 --> 08:12.662
of sustainable
line-caught Coho
costs at Whole Foods?

08:12.670 --> 08:15.742
Well, we never really
romanced those guys,
the high-enders.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.617
Eco-friendly fishing equals
a higher price per pound.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.076
I've checked the numbers.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.617
Our profit margin
goes up six percent.

08:22.620 --> 08:24.281
Six percent, huh?

08:24.290 --> 08:27.669
That _before or after
my donation to Greenpeace?

08:31.580 --> 08:33.787
Ben?

08:33.790 --> 08:35.030
Why don't you come
to your mother's
event tonight,

08:35.040 --> 08:36.871
her fundraiser thingy?

08:36.880 --> 08:39.030
I can't. I got
too much stuff to do.

08:39.040 --> 08:41.873
She just got turned down
by another clinical trial.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.871
You know your mother
would never mention it,

08:43.880 --> 08:46.166
but her spirits
are pretty low, and...

08:46.170 --> 08:48.821
Well, I know that
having you and Doug there
would give her a boost.

08:48.830 --> 08:51.162
Come, and in the meantime,
I promise you,

08:51.170 --> 08:53.661
I'll really think
about what you said here.

08:57.790 --> 08:59.200
-Hi.
-Hey.

08:59.210 --> 09:00.609
Thanks for the call.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.877
How'd she end up here?

09:03.880 --> 09:05.700
I went out and found her.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.286
What is up
with you and them?

09:10.290 --> 09:12.667
[Helen] Well, maybe
they sense my empathy.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.706
The perpetual outsider.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.109
How do you know
so much about them?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.610
There's something
you're not telling us.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.702
Oh, there's a lot
I'm not telling you.

09:19.710 --> 09:22.110
Like what?
Helen, you need--

09:22.120 --> 09:23.496
-[Ryn hisses]
-[He|en] Oh.

09:25.380 --> 09:27.245
Should we be worried?

09:41.250 --> 09:42.820
No more fight.

09:44.830 --> 09:47.537
[tea kettle whistling]

09:47.540 --> 09:48.609
Oh.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.610
A tea party?

09:52.620 --> 09:54.668
It's chamomile.

09:54.670 --> 09:56.820
Might calm them down.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.616
Why don't we all sit?

09:58.620 --> 09:59.746
Go.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.496
I talk to sister.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.910
Are you sure?

10:04.920 --> 10:06.876
Go.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.279
Let's let them
work it out alone.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.281
In my apartment?

10:10.290 --> 10:12.667
[Helen] Damn.

11:10.580 --> 11:12.616
How can I help you?

11:12.620 --> 11:14.326
Uh...

11:14.330 --> 11:16.207
I'm looking for Ben Pownall.

11:16.210 --> 11:17.996
He's not here today.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.786
Do you know
where I might find him?

11:19.790 --> 11:21.496
Can I ask who's asking?

11:21.500 --> 11:23.786
A fellow biologist

11:23.790 --> 11:25.781
_ interested in his work
In Steller feeding patterns.

11:25.790 --> 11:28.532
Oh. Ben's the man
for that for sure.

11:28.540 --> 11:30.826
Yeah. So do you know
when he'll be back?

11:30.830 --> 11:32.616
Not today.

11:32.620 --> 11:33.826
He's got a thing.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.570
A thing?

11:35.580 --> 11:38.117
Yeah. Some big old
charity hoo-ha thing

11:38.120 --> 11:39.371
his parents are throwing.

11:39.380 --> 11:40.699
Mm.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.609
Thank you.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.201
I'll try back later.

11:51.790 --> 11:52.996
They will help us.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.991
Ben and Maddie.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.740
They will bring back
our food.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.321
[exhales sharply]
I see his face

11:59.330 --> 12:02.163
in that place
take our food.

12:02.170 --> 12:03.706
That was not him.

12:03.710 --> 12:06.531
That was his father.

12:06.540 --> 12:07.825
Ben will help.

12:07.830 --> 12:09.661
-[gasp51
-No!

12:10.920 --> 12:13.878
You help him,

12:13.880 --> 12:14.949
not me.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.575
You try to kill him.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.570
So I help.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.200
You

12:27.210 --> 12:29.872
like human.

12:32.670 --> 12:33.876
You...

12:35.000 --> 12:36.740
like...

12:38.120 --> 12:39.417
human.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.455
[hisses]

12:48.330 --> 12:49.991
[Marissa] Drugs.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.661
-[Clarence] Ya think?
-Yeah.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.285
But it must be
somethIn' new.

12:53.290 --> 12:56.874
Young women,
small stature,

12:56.880 --> 12:59.075
similar crimes.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.207
These two might have been
on the same crank.

13:01.210 --> 13:03.997
Tweaked out
and flyin' high.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.321
There's some connection here.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.072
Since when does it
take two days to fix
an intake manifold?

13:13.080 --> 13:14.877
Mechanics charge
by the hour.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.745
Yeah, well, it sucks.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.115
I mean, I just
get back to work,

13:18.120 --> 13:19.826
and then your dad's
engine conks out.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.661
Well, sucks worse
for my dad.

13:24.710 --> 13:26.951
-That's him.
-Who?

13:28.250 --> 13:31.287
The guy
from the military place.

13:31.290 --> 13:32.917
What, the guy
that found you in Alaska?

13:33.960 --> 13:35.450
Are you sure?

13:35.460 --> 13:36.870
Yeah.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.878
What the hell
is he doin' here?

13:42.330 --> 13:44.241
[Ben] And you're sure
it was him?

13:44.250 --> 13:47.413
[Chris]
Like Jesus himself, man.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.069
What's he doin' in town?

13:49.080 --> 13:51.071
You think
he's lookin' for me?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.412
If he was,
you'd know about it.

13:53.420 --> 13:54.739
[Xander] Tell him
what you told me.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.321
Oh, yeah.
So, well, in Alaska,

13:57.330 --> 14:01.243
this Decker,
he's askin' all about
this psycho nurse, right?

14:01.250 --> 14:03.457
And then
as he's leavin', he...

14:03.460 --> 14:08.033
leans in and he...
he asks if she sang to me?

14:08.040 --> 14:09.746
Sang?

14:09.750 --> 14:11.069
Yeah.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.320
Sang.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.612
I mean, this guy's
a total weirdo, right?

14:20.580 --> 14:22.741
I gotta take a leak,
all right?

14:26.290 --> 14:28.918
So, you know
when I told you

14:28.920 --> 14:31.115
that this-- this Decker guy's
after my mermaid?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.951
Yeah, I got
your drunk message, man.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.077
Well, you gotta
ask yourself why.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.957
I mean, why is he here

14:37.960 --> 14:38.995
in Bristol Cove?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.991
I mean, what's he doin'?

14:41.000 --> 14:46.074
So here's my, uh, crazy
not-so-crazy answer.

14:46.080 --> 14:50.244
Decker's here _
because the mermaid IS here.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.786
Mmm.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.166
[Maddie] He was writing
about the possibility

15:00.170 --> 15:03.207

Nada. Just disappeared.

15:14.210 --> 15:19.204
Okay, so those schools
didn't want Decker
and his mermaid theories,

15:19.210 --> 15:21.667
but the Naw did.

15:21.670 --> 15:25.663
I mean, he went
all the way to Alaska
to look for Donna.

15:25.670 --> 15:29.322
Now he shows up
in Bristol Cove? Why?

she's here?

He's connected
to the overfishing, too.

about a Siren song, right?

Only it's not a song exactly.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.321

16:08.330 --> 16:11.322
I don't know, maybe it's
some kind of defense mechanism.

16:11.330 --> 16:12.911
How do you know all this?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.873

[Helen] Yes. Why?
What's goin' on?

26:45.830 --> 26:46.956
All right, listen to me.

26:46.960 --> 26:49.451
Do not let them
go out, okay?

26:49.460 --> 26:51.496
There's a man
looking for them.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.707
Ryn's sister needs
to get back to the water.

26:53.710 --> 26:55.610
We'll deal with it
as soon as we get there.

26:55.620 --> 26:57.281
Can you just put Ryn on?

26:59.420 --> 27:00.535
It's for you.

27:00.540 --> 27:01.609
[phone beeps]

27:05.960 --> 27:07.825
Hello? Yes.

27:07.830 --> 27:09.707
Ryn, it's not safe outside.

27:09.710 --> 27:11.610
You need to stay inside.

27:11.620 --> 27:14.202
[Ben]
That man from the lab,

27:14.210 --> 27:15.746
-he's here at the party.
-[Donna hissing]

27:15.750 --> 27:16.910
-Man?
-Yes!'

27:16.920 --> 27:19.707
The bad man
who hurt Donna.

27:19.710 --> 27:21.780
He's here.
He's looking for her.

27:21.790 --> 27:23.371
[hisses]

27:23.380 --> 27:25.780
You have to stay
at Helen's, okay?

27:25.790 --> 27:27.872
[Maddie] Ryn!

27:28.920 --> 27:30.114
Okay, yes.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.199
-Thank you.
-[phone beeps]

27:42.750 --> 27:43.956
[car alarm chirps]

28:01.460 --> 28:02.529
[chirps]

28:02.540 --> 28:04.417
Where's my damn mermaid?

28:04.420 --> 28:05.455
Excuse me?

28:05.460 --> 28:06.745
Let me refresh your memory.

28:06.750 --> 28:08.320
Your goons stole her.

28:08.330 --> 28:10.378
From my boat,
the North Star?

28:10.380 --> 28:12.200
You have me mistaken
with somebody else.

28:12.210 --> 28:14.246
Oh, here's what I think.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.571
You took my friend Chris
and the mermaid to your place,

28:16.580 --> 28:18.161
lab, prison,
whatever it was,

28:18.170 --> 28:21.412
then Chris,
he manages to get out.

28:21.420 --> 28:22.785
Takes that crazy nurse
with him,

28:22.790 --> 28:24.826
drives her all the way
to Libbey Beach.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.287
Then, poof!

28:27.290 --> 28:29.872
That nurse disappeared,

28:29.880 --> 28:31.416
and then you,

28:31.420 --> 28:35.459
you spend a whole month
tracking Chris down to Alaska

28:35.460 --> 28:37.781
to ask him about her.

28:37.790 --> 28:39.530
Why?

28:39.540 --> 28:41.371
Huh?

28:41.380 --> 28:43.325
It's 'cause I think...

28:43.330 --> 28:45.958
I think that that nurse

28:45.960 --> 28:48.110
is the mermaid.

28:49.670 --> 28:51.786
There's no mermaid.
There never was.

28:51.790 --> 28:54.031
-Bul|shit.
-A deformed cetacean.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.200
I know what I saw!

28:55.210 --> 28:58.031
Do you? [chuckles]

28:58.040 --> 28:59.826
You believe
you caught something

28:59.830 --> 29:02.037
that never
in man's 50,000 years

29:02.040 --> 29:03.996
of sailing the ocean's
ever been corroborated.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.991
No one knew there
were cavemen, either,
until they did.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.740
No mermaid's skeleton's
ever been found.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.456
No dead one's ever
floated up to the surface.

29:09.460 --> 29:13.282
In fact, there's no evidence
of their existence whatsoever.

29:13.290 --> 29:15.201
That doesn't mean
they're not real.

29:15.210 --> 29:17.201
'Cause you caught one, right?

29:17.210 --> 29:19.496
Huh? A live one.

29:19.500 --> 29:23.038
Xander McClure
from Bristol Cove.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.826
Yeah.

29:24.830 --> 29:29.039
And now she's cavorting,
around town with your friends,

29:29.040 --> 29:30.746
driving in cars with them.

29:31.830 --> 29:33.457
Hmph!

29:33.460 --> 29:36.748
You must be a very,
very special man, Mr. McClure.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.956
And have _
some very speCIal friends.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.820
[Maddie]
Where'd he go?

29:49.830 --> 29:51.036
[Ben] I don't know.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.416
I'll check outside.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.952
I'm bringin' in the boats.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.109
What?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.610
I asked Marty
to run the numbers,

30:00.620 --> 30:01.917
and you were right--
six percent.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.660
And it'll help
improve our image.

30:03.670 --> 30:05.114
If I'm gonna be in the paper,

30:05.120 --> 30:06.872
it damn well better be
for something good.

30:06.880 --> 30:08.871
Thanks, Dad.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.916
-Doug?
-No problem.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.660
Uh....

30:17.040 --> 30:18.280
[chuckles]

30:21.210 --> 30:23.451
Hey, Mom?

30:23.460 --> 30:25.109
Have you seen Dr. Decker?

30:25.120 --> 30:27.702
Um, I'm sure he's around,

30:27.710 --> 30:29.666
but, um,
would you sit with me?

30:29.670 --> 30:30.955
Please?

30:30.960 --> 30:34.327
Yeah, of course.
Of course.

30:34.330 --> 30:37.538
I was turned down again
for another clinical trial.

30:37.540 --> 30:39.030
Did you dad tell you?

30:39.040 --> 30:41.611
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

30:41.620 --> 30:42.826
Did you have
something to do

30:42.830 --> 30:44.457
with Dr. Decker
coming to town?

30:44.460 --> 30:45.825
Me? No.

30:47.460 --> 30:50.111
Well, he's very enthusiastic
about his research,

30:50.120 --> 30:51.872
but I want you to know,

30:51.880 --> 30:53.029
I don't need it.

30:53.040 --> 30:56.077
-Mom.
-No, I-- Let me finish, okay?

30:56.080 --> 30:58.822
I know I'm never
getting out of this chair,

30:58.830 --> 31:00.741
and I'm okay with it,

31:00.750 --> 31:02.536
but I'm really,
really touched

31:02.540 --> 31:04.747
that you still
want to help me, Ben.

31:04.750 --> 31:06.991
Ithought
you'd given up on me.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.915
[Siren song echoing]

31:14.790 --> 31:16.109
[conversation muted]
-Hi.
-Hello.

31:16.120 --> 31:21.911
[overlapping voices
singing Siren song]

31:42.210 --> 31:45.327
[dramatic music playing]

31:45.330 --> 31:47.207
I'll see you later.

31:47.210 --> 31:48.325
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

31:51.500 --> 31:52.706
Maddie? Sorry.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.780
-Excuse me.
-What? Sorry.

32:01.080 --> 32:04.959
[Siren song echoing]

32:22.080 --> 32:23.240
It's you.

32:28.210 --> 32:30.747
I'm so happy to see you.

32:30.750 --> 32:33.412
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

32:33.420 --> 32:35.877
I never meant
to hurt you.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.167
I should have found
a better way to study you.

32:45.080 --> 32:46.069
[hissing]

32:47.250 --> 32:48.615
What's happening?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.206
There's two of you?

32:53.380 --> 32:54.529
[hissing]

32:57.120 --> 32:58.246

33:09.290 --> 33:10.917
[Donna hisses]

33:10.920 --> 33:12.615
[Ben] What's goin' on?!

33:14.080 --> 33:17.538
-Ryn?
-He hurt my sister!

33:17.540 --> 33:21.499
Please. I'm not gonna
hurt you, I promise.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.116
Aah! Aah!

33:24.120 --> 33:26.452
[choking]

33:26.460 --> 33:28.280
Ryn! Stop!

33:34.210 --> 33:36.075
No! I kill him.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.991
He hurt my sister!

33:38.000 --> 33:39.285
I know. I know he did.

33:39.290 --> 33:40.496
Oh, please!

33:40.500 --> 33:41.876
Ryn? Ryn, wait, please!

33:43.250 --> 33:46.287
You want it to stop?
Call it off!

33:46.290 --> 33:49.077
Whatever's goin' on
out there, stop it!

33:49.080 --> 33:51.071
-Bring in that trawler!
-[Maddie] Ryn, think!

33:51.080 --> 33:52.911
It's not just you
and Donna in danger!

33:52.920 --> 33:54.205
-It's all of you!
-Make the call!

33:56.460 --> 33:58.109
[coughing]

33:58.120 --> 33:59.917
Call!

34:03.170 --> 34:05.912
[phone beeping]

34:07.920 --> 34:11.071
Admiral, I don't have
time to explain.

34:12.670 --> 34:15.491
_ Just call
In the trawler, now.

34:15.500 --> 34:16.910
Sir, I wouldn't
be asking--

34:16.920 --> 34:17.955
Put it on speaker!

34:20.120 --> 34:21.326
[Harrison]
It's in motion.

34:21.330 --> 34:22.786
We're not pulling back.
No chance.

34:22.790 --> 34:25.202
You've done a fine job.

34:25.210 --> 34:27.531
-I'm sorry.
-Tonight all that
hard work pays off.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.280
-[hissing]
-No, no, no!

34:29.290 --> 34:31.827
Ryn, Ryn, Ryn! Wait!
You can't kill him!

34:31.830 --> 34:33.320
-Move!
-No.

34:33.330 --> 34:35.207
Why you help the bad man?

34:35.210 --> 34:37.030
[Donna growls]

34:37.040 --> 34:38.780
[Decker screams]

34:38.790 --> 34:41.577
-Move!
-No, no, no.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.786
[groaning]

34:42.790 --> 34:44.166
You choose him.

34:44.170 --> 34:45.876
No. Ryn.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.371
You should choose me!

34:48.380 --> 34:49.870
[hisses]

34:55.330 --> 34:58.072
Are you okay?

34:58.080 --> 35:00.321
They can't go
back in the water.

35:00.330 --> 35:04.369
The Navy,
it's out there.

35:04.380 --> 35:06.371
[coughing]

35:10.210 --> 35:12.166
My favorite part
of the evening.

35:12.170 --> 35:13.410
[chuckles]

35:13.420 --> 35:17.538
Are you bringing in the boats
to make Ben happy?

35:17.540 --> 35:19.997
I'm bringing in the boats
because if I don't try
something new,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.958
I'm gonna
become the old guard.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.746
And there's only one end
to the old guard.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.371
Well, I'm happy
to hear it.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.824
Ben's got some good ideas.

35:29.830 --> 35:30.876
He does.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.245
I like that girl
of his, too.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.377
Maddie.

35:34.380 --> 35:37.326
You do know that's
Dale Bishop's step-daughter?

35:37.330 --> 35:38.991
I do.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.877
I also think she's smart,
she has spunk.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.199
Spunk? [laughs]

35:42.210 --> 35:43.950
Okay, Mr. Cleaver.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.452
In fact,
she kind of reminds me
of a younger you.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.951
You should invite her
to lunch again.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.416
Why would I do that?

35:52.420 --> 35:54.320
Because we like
haVIn' Ben around,

35:54.330 --> 35:56.241
and Ben likes havin'
her around.

35:56.250 --> 36:01.278
Bittersweet that song

36:01.290 --> 36:03.827
When the darkness comes

36:03.830 --> 36:05.240
[Donna] You See?

36:05.250 --> 36:06.376
What?

36:06.380 --> 36:09.417
What we learn
in the water

36:09.420 --> 36:12.378
about humans.

36:12.380 --> 36:14.666
It is right.

36:14.670 --> 36:16.319
No.

36:16.330 --> 36:17.490
Yes!

36:17.500 --> 36:19.912
I kill all.

36:19.920 --> 36:24.072
On land, in water.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.286
All.

36:25.290 --> 36:26.279
No!

36:26.290 --> 36:27.996
No?

36:28.000 --> 36:30.491
Kill the bad ones, yes.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.319
Not the good.

36:31.330 --> 36:34.914
You choose human

36:34.920 --> 36:36.490
over me.

36:37.830 --> 36:40.037
I choose not to kill.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.450
Go!

36:43.330 --> 36:44.240
Now!

36:46.880 --> 36:47.869
No.

Finish up, man, come on!
Let's go!

Dude, that's her, man.

Just wait a minute!

39:16.290 --> 39:19.327
I don't know.
It keeps goin' voicemail.

39:20.330 --> 39:21.877
He's at Janine's.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.666
Just get over there
and pull his naked ass
outta bed.

39:23.670 --> 39:25.490
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

39:31.290 --> 39:32.700
Hey, it's Ben.

I, uh...

39:38.620 --> 39:40.497
I was right, man.

39:40.500 --> 39:43.458
Man, I saw her!

39:43.460 --> 39:47.578
Just, um, get down here,
all right?

39:47.580 --> 39:49.286
We're gonna go get her.

-What? _
