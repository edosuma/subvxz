00:03.174 --> 00:05.176
(Meredith) WHEN YOU GET SICK,

00:05.176 --> 00:08.679
IT STARTS OUT
WITH A SINGLE BACTERIUM...

00:08.679 --> 00:12.643
ONE LONE, NASTY INTRUDER.

00:12.643 --> 00:15.046

00:15.046 --> 00:16.647

00:16.647 --> 00:19.150
(speaks indistinctly)

00:19.150 --> 00:22.022
BECOMES TWO.

00:22.022 --> 00:27.198
THEN THOSE TWO BECOME FOUR...

00:27.198 --> 00:30.131
AND THOSE FOUR BECOME EIGHT.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.632
THEN...

00:31.632 --> 00:34.265
BEFORE YOUR BODY KNOWS IT...

00:34.265 --> 00:37.037
IT'S UNDER ATTACK.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.270
OH, HEY. YOU CAN'T
PUT THAT IN THERE.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.712
OH, THEY TOLD US
TO GRAB A CUBBY.

00:41.712 --> 00:45.176
YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S JUST...
WE KEEP IT EMPTY FOR A REASON.

00:45.176 --> 00:47.678
CAN YOU JUST
TAKE YOUR STUFF OUT?

00:47.678 --> 00:51.552
THERE ARE SOME EMPTY ONES
OVER THERE YOU CAN USE.
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.085
I SAID TAKE IT OUT.

00:54.085 --> 00:57.458
GREAT. I GOT THE CRAZY ONE
NEXT TO ME.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.131
(laughs)
OH, YOU WANT TO FIGHT?
'CAUSE I WILL.

01:00.131 --> 01:03.234
(Alex) IZZIE. IZ.
I WILL FIGHT YOU.
YOU'RE PRETTY TINY.

01:03.234 --> 01:05.836
COME ON. COME ON.
I COULD TAKE YOU DOWN
IN JUST A COUPLE OF SECONDS.

01:05.836 --> 01:08.269
COME ON.
STOP.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.101
IT'S AN INVASION.

01:10.101 --> 01:12.643
THE QUESTION FOR A DOCTOR IS,

01:12.643 --> 01:15.146
ONCE THE INVADERS HAVE LANDED,

01:15.146 --> 01:18.579
ONCE THEY'VE TAKEN OVER
YOUR BODY...

01:18.579 --> 01:20.581
THEY TOOK GEORGE'S CUBBY.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.154

I JUST... ♪

OF A PRAIRIE FIRE...

01:38.098 --> 01:39.600
(Meredith) THEY'RE LOCUSTS--

01:39.600 --> 01:42.102
COMFORTABLE LOCUSTS,
FEEDING ON OUR SURGERIES.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.604
(Izzie) IT'S RUDE.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.606
THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST
A COUPLE OF DAYS

01:45.606 --> 01:47.107
WHERE THEY ACT LIKE GUESTS

01:47.107 --> 01:49.780
BEFORE THEY PUT THEIR FEET UP
ON THE COFFEE TABLE.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.782
AND WHAT'S WITH
THE ORANGE SCRUBS?

01:51.782 --> 01:54.845
WHAT, OURS AREN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR 'EM?
WE RAN OUT.
THEY'RE ON BACK ORDER.

RANDALL FROM THE SUPPLY COMPANY
SAYS THERE'LL BE HERE IN A WEEK.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.892
THAT'S WHAT YOU LEARN
WHEN YOU LIE HERE ALL DAY.
WHY BOTHER
ORDERING NEW ONES?

02:01.892 --> 02:03.854
WE COULD JUST GIVE THESE
TO OUR REPLACEMENTS.

02:03.854 --> 02:06.126

REPLACED BY ANYBODY.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.560

A CORONER...

02:11.162 --> 02:14.165
TELL HIM WHAT?
THEY'RE HERE. IT'S OVER.

02:14.165 --> 02:18.138
HEY. WE ARE NOT SOME STUPID
HOSTS. THEY CAN'T INVADE US.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.271
THEY CAN'T ATTACH THEMSELVES
TO OUR FACES

02:20.271 --> 02:22.773
AND THEN WHILE WE'RE
EATING SPAGHETTI,

02:22.773 --> 02:25.776
EXPLODE OUT OF OUR CHESTS
AND SKITTER ACROSS THE FLOOR.

02:25.776 --> 02:28.319
THIS IS OUR SHIP.
THIS IS OURSHIP.

02:28.319 --> 02:30.150

ARE YOU QUOTING

02:30.150 --> 02:32.223
A SIGOURNEY WEAVER MOVIE?

02:32.223 --> 02:35.226
(Meredith) SHUT UP.
(laughs) THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU LIVE HERE.

02:35.226 --> 02:37.228
YOU WATCH A LOT OF TV.

02:37.228 --> 02:40.191
WE OWN THIS HOSPITAL.

02:40.191 --> 02:42.563
WE WERE BORN IN THIS HOSPITAL.

02:42.563 --> 02:47.498
AND WE WILL HOLD THIS HOSPITAL
WITH OUR LAST GASPING BREATH.

02:47.498 --> 02:49.640
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE
A CORONER.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.742
I DON'T LIKE DEAD PEOPLE.

02:51.742 --> 02:54.645
GO OUT THERE AND GO GET
SURGERIES BEFORE THEY TAKE THEM.

02:54.645 --> 02:59.510
GO! AND I WANT A FULL REPORT
BY THE END OF THE DAY.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.752

SURGERIES, CRISTINA.

03:07.918 --> 03:09.620

HERE AGAIN ONE DAY.

03:13.224 --> 03:15.596

WANT TO BE OUT OF PRACTICE.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.698
NOW GO.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.231

IS THIS OVERFLOW
FROM MERCY WEST?

03:20.231 --> 03:22.733

03:27.608 --> 03:30.611
YEAH.
YOU PICKED A GOOD ONE.
IT'S NICE AND QUIET.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.613

THANK YOU.
OKAY, WHERE DO YOU WANT US?

03:34.615 --> 03:37.388
UH, AT THIS POINT,
ANYWHERE IS GOOD.
AT MERCY WEST, WE DO ZONES.

03:37.388 --> 03:40.621

GIVE EVERYONE A ZONE, A SPACE.

03:48.799 --> 03:52.263

I KNOW YOU STILL HAVE CUTS

YOUR CRAZY ADVENTURES.

OH, WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA--

07:12.202 --> 07:15.466
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME YOU GET
WHERE HE'S COMING FROM?
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
AND TALK TO HIM.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.437
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.940
IF HE WANTS TO THROW AWAY
OUR RELATIONSHIP AFTER 30 YEARS,

07:19.940 --> 07:22.212
THEN THAT'S HIS DECISION.
HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING HERE.

07:22.212 --> 07:24.214
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CHANGED THE GAME.

07:24.214 --> 07:27.117

07:57.147 --> 07:59.149
SIT DOWN

07:59.149 --> 08:03.614
GIVE HIM ROOM TO BE
A LITTLE SHOCKED.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.757
I HATE YOU.

FIRST-DAY MADNESS.

08:14.124 --> 08:16.126
WELL, WE BOTH GOT ASSIGNED
ZONE FIVE, SO...

08:16.126 --> 08:18.128

YOU HAD ANY CHOICE.

08:18.128 --> 08:20.831
STILL, YOU'RE A PEACH
TO PRETEND OTHERWISE.
(woman) HERE YOU GO.

08:20.831 --> 08:22.833
BEING THE NEW KID IS...
A LITTLE SCARY, I KNOW.

08:22.833 --> 08:25.135
OF COURSE, YOU WERE HERE
WHEN THAT PSYCHO-INTERN CABAL

08:25.135 --> 08:27.838
WAS MARCHING AROUND CHOPPING OUT
EACH OTHER'S ORGANS.

08:27.838 --> 08:29.840
(laughs) NOW THAT
MUST HAVE BEEN SCARY.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.512
HI. I'M DR. KEPNER.
OH, HANDCUFFS.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.514
I'M NOT AN AX MURDERER.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.186
I JUST BROKE IN
TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE.

08:36.186 --> 08:38.689
DUDE CAME AFTER ME
WITH A GOLF CLUB,

08:38.689 --> 08:40.991
BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

08:40.991 --> 08:44.224
LOOK, YOU DON'T NEED THE COP.
I CAN BARELY MOVE.
ROLL HIM.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.928
OH, WE'LL KEEP THE COP.
(groans)

08:47.928 --> 08:51.031
HE'S GOT MULTIPLE CONTUSIONS
AND ECCHYMOSIS OVER HIS BACK.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.033
HE'S GONNA NEED LUMBAR
AND THORACIC FILMS. DOWN.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.536
(man exhales deeply)
OKAY, AND BY THE WAY,
IT WAS ONE ORGAN--AN APPENDIX.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.069
IT WASN'T A PSYCHO CABAL.
OH.

08:59.069 --> 09:01.672
GOOD TO KNOW.

09:01.672 --> 09:03.043
(police radio chatter)

09:03.043 --> 09:04.745
HEY, SARAH.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.046
DR. STEVENS.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.979
OKAY, I HAVE TO GO.
THE DOCTORS ARE HERE.

09:08.979 --> 09:11.982
MY SISTER AND HER DAUGHTERS
WANT YOU ALL TO PROMISE THEM

09:11.982 --> 09:14.955
IT'S A GOOD KIDNEY.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.157
(doctors) IT'S A GOOD KIDNEY.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.990
THERE, ALL RIGHT?
(laughs) BYE.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.992
UH, SARAH FREMONT, AGE 27.
END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE.

09:21.992 --> 09:24.765
ON DIALYSIS FOR THREE YEARS,
WAITING FOR A KIDNEY.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.767
SHE'S DOWN TO
HER LAST ACCESS SITE.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.769
THAT'S THE POLITE WAY
OF SAYING

09:28.769 --> 09:31.141
THEY'VE RUN OUT OF PLACES
TO STICK THE NEEDLES.

09:31.141 --> 09:33.644
MS. FREMONT HAS A SUBCLAVIAN
CATHETER FOR ACCESS.

09:33.644 --> 09:35.105
WHY IS THIS NOT IDEAL?

09:35.105 --> 09:37.908
IT'S DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN
SUFFICIENT BLOOD FLOW

09:37.908 --> 09:40.050
THROUGH...

09:40.050 --> 09:42.853
OH. YOU GUYS RAISE HANDS.

09:42.853 --> 09:44.584
(siren wails)

09:44.584 --> 09:47.087
FRANK NUSBAUM, 42, MULTIPLE,
MOSTLY SUPERFICIAL STAB WOUNDS.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.659
VITAL SIGNS STABLE.

09:48.659 --> 09:50.861
HIS BUDDY'S GOT
A LACERATED PALM.
GOT IT. THANKS, RAY.

09:50.861 --> 09:52.162
I'M NOT HIS BUDDY!

09:52.162 --> 09:54.164
HE TOUCHED MY LITTLE GIRL,
MY BABY!

09:54.164 --> 09:56.867
SHE'S NOT A BABY.
SHE'S 19 YEARS OLD.

09:56.867 --> 09:59.599
THERE AIN'T A SCRAP
OF BABY LEFT THERE, DON.
ON THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.101
(groans)

10:01.101 --> 10:03.273
(grunts)
OKAY, OKAY,
WE GOT A BLEEDER HERE.

10:03.273 --> 10:05.275
UH, DRAW ME UP SOME LIDOCAINE
AND, UH,

10:05.275 --> 10:07.838
GET ME A LAC TRAY
WITH 3-0 SILK.
NEED ANY HELP?

10:07.838 --> 10:09.079
SIR, THIS IS GONNA PINCH.

10:09.079 --> 10:11.982
UGH! HE CAME AT ME
WITH A CARVING KNIFE.

10:11.982 --> 10:15.716
HE TRIED TO CUT OFF MY--
COME ON. I WAS GESTURING!
YOU RAN INTO THE KNIFE.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.118
YOU'RE AN IDIOT
AND A PERVERT.
TIE.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.390
SHE USED TO BABYSIT
YOUR BRATS.

10:20.390 --> 10:23.153
I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER
LET HER IN YOUR HOUSE!
I LOVE HER, DON. I LOVE HER,
AND SHE LOVES ME.

10:23.153 --> 10:25.295
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.
EASY, ALL RIGHT?

10:25.295 --> 10:29.129
LET HIM DIE. JUST LET HIM DIE.
IT'S WHAT HE DESERVES.
CAN YOU SHUT HIM UP?

10:29.129 --> 10:33.633
ARE YOU SURE
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO--
THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S HOW
WE DO IT ON OUR SIDE OF TOWN.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.966
NICE TRY. THIS IS MY ZONE.
HE'S MY PATIENT.

10:35.966 --> 10:38.068
YET I'M THE ONE
ACTUALLY HELPING HIM.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.640
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
HAVING STOMACH PAINS?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.973
UH, A FEW DAYS NOW.
UM, THEY KEEP GETTING WORSE.

10:42.973 --> 10:45.215
MY DAD A FELL
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,

10:45.215 --> 10:48.148
HAD A STABLE HIP FRACTURE--
EXCUSE ME.
THIS IS MY PATIENT.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.150
NOT ANYMORE.
FINE.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.152
GOOD LUCK DOING AN H&P
WITHOUT A CHART.

10:52.152 --> 10:56.156
I'LL JUST ADD THIS
TO THE CHART LATER.
IF YOU CAN FIND IT.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.657
THIS IS THE NURSES' LOUNGE.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.659
IT IS LITERALLY ALWAYS
SOMEONE'S BIRTHDAY,

10:59.659 --> 11:03.193
SO IF YOU'RE NICE TO THE NURSES,
YOU WILL GET CAKE.

11:03.193 --> 11:06.096
THE LAB.
HOW'S THE I.L.-2 GOING,
DR. S., GOOD?

11:06.096 --> 11:07.437
GOOD.

11:07.437 --> 11:10.871
I.L.-2, HUH?
ARE YOU FEELING--

11:10.871 --> 11:13.173
STABLE FOR NOW.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.175
AND YOU DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW

11:15.175 --> 11:17.177
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE
BLOWN AWAY BY THE FACT

11:17.177 --> 11:18.949
THAT YOU'RE
ALREADY BACK AT WORK

11:18.949 --> 11:21.051
AND THEY'LL ONLY BE ABLE
TO THINK OF YOU

11:21.051 --> 11:23.053
AS SOME SORT
OF AWESOME SUPER WOMAN,

11:23.053 --> 11:25.716
WHICH CLEARLY, YOU ARE.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:25.716 --> 11:28.118
THE FAKE FLATTERY?
IT'S KINDA GROSS.

11:28.118 --> 11:31.191
YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
DEEPLY PERSONAL ABOUT ME?

11:34.064 --> 11:37.067
YOU SEE THAT GIRL?
HER NAME'S REED.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.699
I HAVE THE BIGGEST CRUSH
IN THE WORLD ON HER,

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
I'M ALIVE.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.104
SHE CALLS ME CHARLIE.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.706
NOBODY NAMED CHARLIE
EVER GOT THE GIRL--

11:46.706 --> 11:49.109
CHARLIE BROWN,

11:49.109 --> 11:51.411
CHARLIE MANSON.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.114
I'M NOT TRYING TO MINIMIZE
YOUR CANCER OR ANYTHING,

11:54.114 --> 11:56.186
BUT THIS REALLY SUCKS
FOR ME.

11:56.186 --> 11:58.749
YOU LIKE HER?

11:58.749 --> 12:01.451
I LOVE HER.

12:01.451 --> 12:03.123
(elevator bell dings)

12:03.123 --> 12:05.095
43-81.

12:05.095 --> 12:06.396
WHAT'S THAT?

12:06.396 --> 12:08.759
THE CODE
TO THE RESEARCH LIBRARY.

12:11.101 --> 12:13.103
"WHILE PERFORMANCE
HAS BEEN EVALUATED,

12:13.103 --> 12:15.966
THE LARGEST CONSIDERATIONS
HAVE BEEN BUDGETARY."

12:15.966 --> 12:18.969
THIS IS THE SPEECH
WE WANT YOU TO USE

12:18.969 --> 12:21.211
WHEN YOU'RE FIRING STAFF--
THESE EXACT WORDS.

12:21.211 --> 12:24.214
DON'T DEVIATE.
I'M NOT USING YOUR SPEECH
TO FIRE PEOPLE,

12:24.214 --> 12:26.817
AND I DON'T NEED
AN H.R. CHAPERONE.

12:26.817 --> 12:28.949
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.282
CHIEF, ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH MEGAN NOWLAN?

12:32.282 --> 12:34.855
MM, YES, YEAH.
UH, SHE WAS AN INTERN.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.427
SHE WAS MARRIED
TO STEVE MOSTOW.

12:37.427 --> 12:40.190
I FIRED HER.
I KNOW HOW TO FIRE PEOPLE.

12:40.190 --> 12:43.193
I DON'T LIKE IT, BUT I KNOW HOW
TO DO IT, AND I DO IT WELL.

12:43.193 --> 12:45.465
YOU USED AN E-MAIL
TO FIRE HER,

12:45.465 --> 12:48.368
AND NOW SHE'S SUING THE HOSPITAL
FOR WRONGFUL TERMINATION,

12:48.368 --> 12:52.072
CLAIMS SHE WAS FIRED
BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.244
SO...

12:54.244 --> 12:56.076
THIS IS THE SPEECH.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.148
DON'T DEVIATE.

12:58.148 --> 13:00.280
T&L SPINE FILMS SHOWED
A BURST FRACTURE AT T-12.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.282
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE EVIDENCE
OF INSTABILITY

13:02.282 --> 13:05.285
BECAUSE THE VERTEBRAL HEIGHT
LOSS IS GREATER THAN 50%,

13:05.285 --> 13:08.859
WHICH IMPLIES BOTH A.L.L.
AND P.L.L. ARE DISRUPTED.

13:08.859 --> 13:11.121
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
I GOT A BROKEN BACK?

13:11.121 --> 13:13.793
I'LL STILL BE ABLE TO WALK,
RIGHT?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.926
YOU WILL STILL
BE ABLE TO WALK, BURGLE,

13:15.926 --> 13:17.397
HAVE A FULL LIFE.

13:17.397 --> 13:21.101
IDEAS?
DECOMPRESSION VIA CORPECTOMY
AND RECONSTRUCTION

13:21.101 --> 13:23.103
WITH STRUT GRAFT
AND ANTERIOR INSTRUMENTATION.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.136
WOW. I MIGHT BE
OUT OF MY LEAGUE HERE.
WELL, SHE HAS
A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY.

13:26.136 --> 13:28.138
WE'RE ALL
OUT OF THAT LEAGUE.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.580
AND HERE I WAS THINKING YOU
COULD DO TRANSPEDICLE SCREWS

13:30.580 --> 13:33.283
WITH A POSTERIOR APPROACH.

13:33.283 --> 13:34.915
HMM.

13:34.915 --> 13:38.048
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA,
BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE NOT.

13:38.048 --> 13:41.221
LET'S GO
WITH THE PEDICLE SCREWS.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.253
OKAY, GET HIM INTO PRE-OP,

13:43.253 --> 13:46.396
AND LET ME KNOW WHEN
HIS TEST RESULTS COME BACK.
I'M ON IT.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.560
FRANK.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.332
OH.
OH, MY GOD.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.405
HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
I'LL BE FINE, SWEETHEART.

13:55.405 --> 13:58.208
GET OFF OF HER, YOU PERV!
DADDY.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.570
I WILL KILL YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
SECURITY!

14:00.570 --> 14:03.143
(woman) STOP!
(grunts)

14:03.143 --> 14:05.876
(groans)

14:05.876 --> 14:07.047
AAH!

14:07.047 --> 14:09.349
(Owen) NICE WORK.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.122
THANKS.
I GOT IT FROM HERE.

14:12.122 --> 14:13.483
(man) COOL.

14:13.483 --> 14:15.155
(man) AWESOME.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.157
(cheers and applause)

14:17.157 --> 14:20.060
(man) YOU DA MAN.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.600
TACKLE LIKE THAT,
YOU HAD TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.872
I PLAYED A LITTLE
IN COLLEGE.
SAFETY?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.174
AND WIDE RECEIVER, YEAH.

14:34.174 --> 14:37.077
OFFENSE AND DEFENSE.
IMPRESSIVE.

14:39.049 --> 14:41.181
C-CAN YOU BRING THAT GUY
OVER LATER?

14:41.181 --> 14:43.883
I WANT TO THANK HIM.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.956
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

14:45.956 --> 14:47.487
NO, I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.619
I'M STILL SAVING IT.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.294
YOU PAGED?
YES. I RAN A C.T. ON YOUR GUY
WITH THE TUMMY ACHE.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.296
TURNS OUT
HE HAS AN ADRENAL MASS.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.298
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO SEE THE SCANS.

14:58.298 --> 15:02.372
I WAS WAITING UNTIL I GOT
THE LAB RESULTS TO ORDER A C.T.
MM-HMM.

15:02.372 --> 15:04.234
YOU STOLE MY LAB RESULTS?

15:04.234 --> 15:07.177
AND LOOK, NOW I GET A SURGERY
FOR ALL MY TROUBLE.

15:07.177 --> 15:11.141
EXCUSE ME, DR. KAREV, MY DAD
AND I HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS.

15:11.141 --> 15:13.183
HE'S STILL PRETTY UPSET.

15:13.183 --> 15:16.186
YEAH, I'LL BE THERE
IN A MINUTE. THANKS.

15:16.186 --> 15:19.189
I'LL TAKE THOSE.

15:23.353 --> 15:26.926
(speaking indistinctly)

15:26.926 --> 15:28.928
YOU GONNA FIGHT BACK
AT SOME POINT

15:28.928 --> 15:31.001
OR JUST LET HER BURY YOU?

15:31.001 --> 15:33.003
SHE'S NOT BURYING ME.
SHE'S NEW.

15:33.003 --> 15:35.205
SHE'S JUST FINDING
HER FOOTING.

15:35.205 --> 15:38.268
SHE FOUND HER FOOTING
ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK.

15:38.268 --> 15:40.670
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

15:40.670 --> 15:44.074
I DON'T KNOW.
I LIKE YOU.

15:44.074 --> 15:45.375
NO, I LIKE THAT.
(chuckles)

15:45.375 --> 15:47.377
(giggles) STOP.
THAT'S GOOD.

15:47.377 --> 15:49.279
FIND HER OPEN WINDOW.

15:49.279 --> 15:51.051
EVERYONE HAS ONE--

15:51.051 --> 15:54.154
A WEAK SPOT, UNDEFENDED.

15:54.154 --> 15:57.957
AN OPEN WINDOW OR A KEY
HIDDEN IN A FAKE ROCK,

15:57.957 --> 15:59.259
THAT'S HOW I DO IT.

15:59.259 --> 16:02.162
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE A CRIMINAL,
AND I'M NOT.

16:02.162 --> 16:06.296
IT'S NOT A CRIME TO DO TO HER
WHAT SHE'S DOING TO YOU.
WHICH IS WHAT, EXACTLY?

16:06.296 --> 16:09.139
MAKING YOU LOOK
LIKE AN IDIOT.

16:09.139 --> 16:11.371
(Dr. Kepner laughs)

16:11.371 --> 16:13.073
(Derek) HEY.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.245
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO ANY OF THEM?
WHO?

16:15.245 --> 16:17.707
THE MERCY WESTERS.
YEAH.

16:17.707 --> 16:19.079
AND?

16:19.079 --> 16:20.410
AND... I LOVE YOU.

16:20.410 --> 16:23.383
NO, NOT THAT. I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.385
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW CRISTINA'S DOING.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.987
SHE WAS CARDIO DEPRIVED
AND DEPRESSED.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.690
ARE YOU AND CRISTINA
IN A DARK AND TWISTY PLACE?

16:30.690 --> 16:33.323
ARE YOU HAVING
THE DARK AND TWISTIES?
WE ARE.

16:33.323 --> 16:36.326
BOTH OF YOU
ARE DARK AND TWISTY?
I TOLD YOU, WE ARE.

16:36.326 --> 16:38.128
OKAY.
(laughs)

16:38.128 --> 16:41.131
(knocks on door)
UH, EXCUSE ME. DR. HUNT,
UH, YOU PAGED ME?

16:41.131 --> 16:43.173
YOUR PATIENT WAS HAVING
NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS

16:43.173 --> 16:46.076
AND YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,
KAREV?
WELL, I--

16:46.076 --> 16:48.338
LUCKY FOR YOU DR. ADAMSON DID
AND CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED

16:48.338 --> 16:50.040
CAROTID STENOSIS.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.681
BOOK AN O.R.
FOR THE AFTERNOON.

16:51.681 --> 16:53.783
WHAT ABOUT THE SURGERY
FOR HIS ADRENAL TUMOR?

16:53.783 --> 16:56.446
YOUR DAD HAS A 90% BLOCKAGE
IN HIS RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY.

16:56.446 --> 16:59.018
WE NEED TO OPERATE
ON THAT FIRST.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.621
NOW I KNOW
THAT'S A LOT TO DIGEST,

17:01.621 --> 17:05.755
BUT DR. ADAMSON HERE WILL
KEEP YOU INFORMED, ALL RIGHT?
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DR. HUNT,

17:05.755 --> 17:08.758
MR. GOLDMAN IS MY PATIENT.
I FOUND THE TUMOR--
YEAH, AND WHEN I OPERATE
ON THE TUMOR,

17:08.758 --> 17:11.501
YOU CAN SCRUB IN ON THAT.
IN THE MEANTIME,

17:11.501 --> 17:15.265
I WANT YOU TO HELP DR. ADAMSON
PREP THE PATIENT FOR THE C.E.A.

17:15.265 --> 17:18.538
SIR--
WHATEVER SHE NEEDS, KAREV.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.540
NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS?

17:20.540 --> 17:24.714
YOU DIDN'T PUT THAT
IN THE CHART.
OH, I DIDN'T? HMM.

17:24.714 --> 17:27.077
(elevator bell dings)

17:27.077 --> 17:30.720
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I-I GET IT.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.623
I SPRANG THIS ON YOU.
IT WAS A LOT TO TAKE IN.

17:33.623 --> 17:36.626
AND... YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T
HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE

17:36.626 --> 17:38.188
WITH GAY PEOPLE,

17:38.188 --> 17:40.190
EVEN THOUGH UNCLE BERTO
HASN'T BEEN SINGLE

17:40.190 --> 17:42.692
FOR 60 YEARS FOR NO REASON.
CALLIOPE--

17:42.692 --> 17:44.394
IT'S STILL AN ADJUSTMENT.

17:44.394 --> 17:47.697
THAT SAID...

17:47.697 --> 17:50.540
YOU SHOULD'VE ADJUSTED
BY NOW.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.543
I MEAN, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
LOVE ME NO MATTER WHAT.

17:53.543 --> 17:56.306
THAT'S...
WHAT A PARENT DOES.

17:56.306 --> 17:58.308
I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL MY HEART.

17:58.308 --> 18:01.511
BUT WITH ALL THAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU NOW, IT'S...

18:01.511 --> 18:03.813
LOOK, I'M SCARED FOR YOU.

18:03.813 --> 18:07.086
IT'S AN ABOMINATION.
IT'S AN ETERNITY IN HELL.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.620
LET'S NOT START
WITH WORDS LIKE "HELL."
OH, THAT'S WHY YOU FLEW
3,000 MILES,

18:10.620 --> 18:12.622
TO TELL ME
I WAS GOING TO HELL?

18:12.622 --> 18:15.625
I THOUGHT YOU CAME HERE
TO APOLOGIZE.
I CAN'T APOLOGIZE, CALLIOPE.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.627
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED

18:17.627 --> 18:19.369
OR WHERE I WENT WRONG.

18:19.369 --> 18:23.273
WHERE YOU WENT WRONG?
OKAY, LEVITICUS.

18:23.273 --> 18:26.306
"THOU SHALT NOT LIE WITH A MAN
AS ONE LIES WITH A FEMALE."

18:26.306 --> 18:28.638
OH, DON'T DO THAT, DADDY.
DON'T QUOTE THE BIBLE AT ME.
"IT IS AN ABOMINATION."

18:28.638 --> 18:31.281
"THE OUTCRY OF SODOM
AND GOMORRAH IS GREAT,

18:31.281 --> 18:34.284
AND TH-THEIR SIN
IS EXCEEDINGLY GRAVE."
CARLOS,
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE--

18:34.284 --> 18:37.387
JESUS--"A NEW COMMANDMENT
THAT I GIVE UNTO YOU

18:37.387 --> 18:39.689
THAT YOU LOVE ONE ANOTHER."
ROMANS, "BUT WE KNOW
THAT THE LAW--

18:39.689 --> 18:42.222
JESUS--"HE WHO IS
WITHOUT SIN AMONG YOU,

18:42.222 --> 18:44.324
LET HIM CAST THE FIRST STONE."
SO YOU ADMIT IT'S A SIN?

18:44.324 --> 18:47.327
"BLESSED ARE THE MERCIFUL FOR
THEY SHALL OBTAIN MERCY"--JESUS.

18:47.327 --> 18:50.330
"BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART,
FOR THEY SHALL SEE GOD"--JESUS.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.332
"BLESSED ARE THOSE
WHO HAVE BEEN PERSECUTED

18:52.332 --> 18:54.264
"FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS SAKE

18:54.264 --> 18:56.266
FOR THEIRS
IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN."

18:56.266 --> 18:57.907
JESUS IS MY SAVIOR, DADDY,
NOT YOU.

18:57.907 --> 19:00.510
AND JESUS WOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOU FOR JUDGING ME!

19:00.510 --> 19:02.512
(voice breaking)
HE WOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOU

19:02.512 --> 19:05.515
FOR TURNING YOUR BACK ON ME.
HE WOULD BE ASHAMED.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.264
WITH THIS KIND OF INJURY,

19:24.264 --> 19:26.266
THERE IS A CHANCE
THAT YOU COULD END UP

19:26.266 --> 19:29.339
WITH SEVERE WEAKNESS
IN YOUR LEGS.
THAT'S OKAY.

19:29.339 --> 19:32.572
I CARRY THE STUFF OUT
WITH MY ARMS, NOT MY LEGS.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.705
THIS IS SERIOUS, BILLY.
YOU'RE GONNA
FIX ME UP FINE.

19:35.705 --> 19:37.747
LISTEN...

19:37.747 --> 19:40.250
I'VE GOT A PRESENT
FOR YOU.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.751
YOU STOLE HER NOTEBOOK?

19:41.751 --> 19:45.285
KEEP IT DOWN. YOU WANT
MY COP ALL OVER THIS?

19:45.285 --> 19:48.458
DON'T YOU GET IT?
THIS IS HER OPEN WINDOW.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.420
I DON'T--I DON'T WANT
HER OPEN WINDOW.

19:50.420 --> 19:55.295
"YOU'RE NOT JUST A GOOD DOCTOR.
YOU'RE A GREAT DOCTOR."

19:55.295 --> 19:57.827
"YOU ARE THE FUTURE
OF MEDICINE."

19:57.827 --> 20:02.702
(chuckling) "ONLY YOU
CAN KEEP YOU DOWN."

20:02.702 --> 20:05.705
AND MY FAVORITE IS, UH...

20:05.705 --> 20:08.408
"NO ONE CAN TELL
IT'S PLASTIC SURGERY."
OH, MY GOD.

20:08.408 --> 20:11.411
(laughs) I THINK IT'S THE NOSE,
BUT IT COULD BE THE BOOBS.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.544
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
G-GIVE IT BACK TO HER,
AND STOP READING IT.

20:14.544 --> 20:16.946
"FUTURE OF MEDICINE"
ALERT.

20:16.946 --> 20:20.250
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY NOTEBOOK
ANYWHERE, HAVE YOU?

20:20.250 --> 20:23.893
SMALL, RED, I WAS--
I WAS HOLDING IT ALL MORNING.
UM, UM, I'M NOT SURE.

20:23.893 --> 20:26.926
UM--
SO MUCH FOR THAT
PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.629
GOOD LUCK FINDING IT.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.902
(tray clatters)
(Alex) THIS BLOWS.

20:32.902 --> 20:36.466
(sighs)
GETTING YOUR ASS KICKED?
(mouth full) SHUT UP.

20:36.466 --> 20:39.339
I HEAR YOURS GOT
A STANDING OVATION IN THE E.R.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.341
YOURS IS THE ONE
WHO SAVED THE WHOLE E.R.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.673
FROM THE MANIAC
WITH THE HAMMER?
OKAY, HE DIDN'T SAVE ANYONE.

20:43.673 --> 20:46.346
HE DID SOME STUPID NINJA LEAP
AND THEN TRIPPED A GUY.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.649
I USED ACTUAL MEDICINE
TO STOP A PERSON FROM DYING.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.351
WELL, MINE HAS A NOTEBOOK,

20:51.351 --> 20:53.783
A NOTEBOOK
THAT SHE TAKES NOTES IN,

20:53.783 --> 20:57.026
NOTES OF A VERY PERSONAL NATURE,
AND I STOLE IT.
(Cristina) YOU WHAT?

20:57.026 --> 20:59.989
(normal voice) GIVE IT.
NO. NO, I-I AM NOT
SINKING TO THEIR LEVEL.

20:59.989 --> 21:02.261
THEY ARE VINDICTIVE
AND THEY ARE AGGRESSIVE

21:02.261 --> 21:04.394
AND--AND THEY ARE NOT
TEAM PLAYERS.

21:04.394 --> 21:06.366
(hits table)
AND IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL,

21:06.366 --> 21:08.368
THAT SPIRIT IS
GOING TO INFECT OUR HOSPITAL.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.039
WE HAVE TO FIGHT IT.

21:10.039 --> 21:13.042
WHICH IS WHY YOU STOLE
HER NOTEBOOK?
(mouth full) AND READ IT?

21:13.042 --> 21:15.044
WELL, SHE'S NOT
A VERY NICE PERSON.

21:15.044 --> 21:16.406
HEY.

21:16.406 --> 21:18.348
OH, SCORE. YOU ROCK.

21:18.348 --> 21:20.850
OH, NO. THAT'S NOT FOR YOU.
WHO'S IT FOR THEN?

21:20.850 --> 21:23.353
CHARLES.
YOUR MERCY WESTER?!

21:23.353 --> 21:25.355
THEY'RE HANDING US
OUR ASSES ON A PLATE,

21:25.355 --> 21:28.358
AND YOU'RE SERVING 'EM
COFFEE?
CHARLES IS ACTUALLY
KIND OF AWESOME.

21:28.358 --> 21:30.560
AND IF YOU ALL COULD GET PAST
YOUR SAD, LITTLE EGOS,

21:30.560 --> 21:32.592
YOU WOULD REALIZE,
YOU CAN'T WRITE OFF

21:32.592 --> 21:35.595
ALL OF THE MERCY WEST RESIDENTS
JUST 'CAUSE YOU FEEL THREATENED.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.467
OH,
WE DON'T FEEL THREATENED.

21:37.467 --> 21:38.568
NO.

21:38.568 --> 21:42.301
YEAH, WE FEEL
PRETTY THREATENED.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.576
(man)
♪ WE'LL TRY TO SPELL ♪

21:46.576 --> 21:49.779
DUDES...
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

21:49.779 --> 21:50.940
HALLELUJAH.

21:50.940 --> 21:54.344
THEY'RE NOT EATING.
THEY'RE WORKING.

21:54.344 --> 21:56.386
(slurps)

21:56.386 --> 21:58.388
OH, MY GOD.
THEY DON'T EAT LUNCH.

21:58.388 --> 22:00.750
OH, GOD!

22:00.750 --> 22:02.452
WH-WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:02.452 --> 22:04.454
PULSATILE MASS
OVER THE STAB WOUND.

22:04.454 --> 22:06.996
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT,
DR. AVERY?
CAN'T BE SURE
WITHOUT AN ANGIO,

22:06.996 --> 22:09.659
BUT I THINK
IT'S A PSEUDOANEURYSM.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:09.659 --> 22:12.562
KEEP PRESSURE ON IT.
LET'S GET HIM UP TO ANGIO,

22:12.562 --> 22:15.735
AND IF IT'S POSITIVE,
YOU'RE SCRUBBING IN.
THANK YOU, SIR.

22:15.735 --> 22:18.107
BUT THAT'S MY PATIENT.
HE WAS HERE, AND YOU WEREN'T.

22:18.107 --> 22:20.540
DR. HUNT!
WHAT?

22:24.113 --> 22:26.115
CRISTINA, WHAT? WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:26.115 --> 22:29.348
THAT DOESN'T MATTER THAT
THAT'S MY PATIENT OR MY SURGERY?

22:29.348 --> 22:32.121
YOU'RE PRIORITIZING BASED ON
SOME SORT OF RANDOM CODE,

22:32.121 --> 22:34.624
SOME STUPID RULE YOU HAVE
NOT TO FAVOR ME?

22:34.624 --> 22:37.126
THIS--THIS IS ONE SURGERY.
(sighs)

22:37.126 --> 22:40.089
FORGET IT.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.435
(chuckles) THE WOMAN DOES
WHATEVER I ASK.

22:45.435 --> 22:47.437
I WANT SOMETHING...
(snaps fingers)

22:47.437 --> 22:48.938
SHE GETS IT FOR ME.

22:48.938 --> 22:51.641
THE RESEARCH LIBRARY? ANYTIME
YOU WANT TO GO IN, IT'S CLOSED,

22:51.641 --> 22:54.103
JUST SAY THE WORD. SHE GAVE ME
THE CODE TO THE PLACE.
YOU'RE KIDDING.

22:54.103 --> 22:57.376
SHE CAN'T DO ENOUGH FOR ME.
(laughs)

22:57.376 --> 22:59.479
IT'S LIKE I HAVE
MY OWN SURGICAL BITCH.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.581
(clears throat)

23:19.499 --> 23:22.502
(sniffling)

23:25.475 --> 23:27.737
DIDN'T GO WELL, HUH?

23:27.737 --> 23:29.979
(sobs)

23:29.979 --> 23:32.982
WELL, AT LEAST NOW
I CAN MOVE ON WITH MY LIFE.

23:32.982 --> 23:34.814
STOP ENTERTAINING ANY THOUGHTS

23:34.814 --> 23:38.047
OF ACTUALLY GETTING
BACK TOGETHER WITH MY FAMILY.

23:38.047 --> 23:42.091
(sighs) WHATEVER.
I DON'T NEED A FATHER.

23:42.091 --> 23:44.824
I DON'T...

23:44.824 --> 23:48.057
NOT ONE WHO WON'T ACCEPT ME.

23:48.057 --> 23:49.899
(sobs)

23:49.899 --> 23:52.662
(whispers) I KNOW.

23:52.662 --> 23:55.665
(crying)

24:00.610 --> 24:02.942
WELL, HIS VITAL SIGNS
ARE FINE.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.514
B.P. LOOKS GOOD.

24:04.514 --> 24:06.776
I HURT.

24:06.776 --> 24:09.479
THE NECK... BLOOD...

24:09.479 --> 24:11.080
WHAT?

24:11.080 --> 24:13.152
IN HEAD...

24:13.152 --> 24:15.655
PLACE... 12.

24:15.655 --> 24:18.628
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?
I'M NOT SURE.

24:18.628 --> 24:21.631
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO, UH,
HOLD OFF ON THE O.R.

24:21.631 --> 24:23.232
(whispers) PATHETIC.

24:23.232 --> 24:25.765
LOOK, HE JUST SAID
A BUNCH OF WEIRD CRAP, OKAY?

24:25.765 --> 24:27.767
HE HAS EXPRESSIVE APHASIA,
WHICH MEANS BROCA'S AREA,

24:27.767 --> 24:30.039
WHICH IS THE LEFT SIDE
OF THE BRAIN.

24:30.039 --> 24:32.672
YOU SAID IT WAS THE RIGHT SIDE
THAT WAS BLOCKED.
5% OF PEOPLE HAVE BROCA'S
ON THE RIGHT.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.144
YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT CHANCE?
WHAT IF IT'S A BRAIN MET

24:35.144 --> 24:37.847
FROM THE TUMOR?
OH, RIGHT. BECAUSE YOU DIAGNOSED
A TUMOR, NOW IT'S A MET.

24:37.847 --> 24:41.150
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.
HAVE YOU?
ENOUGH!

24:41.150 --> 24:44.754
(scoffs) YOUR BEHAVIOR
HAS BEEN DISGUSTING.

24:44.754 --> 24:47.587
I MEAN, ALL YOU'VE DONE
ALL DAY IS TAKE PLEASURE

24:47.587 --> 24:50.760
IN HOW THE OTHER ONE GOT IT
WRONG, HOW THEY SCREWED IT UP.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.962
THIS IS MY FATHER...

24:52.962 --> 24:55.094
MY FATHER.

24:55.094 --> 25:00.229
AND... AND YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE HEALERS.

25:00.229 --> 25:02.231
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE JOB'S
SUPPOSED TO BE,

25:02.231 --> 25:05.274
TO HEAL PEOPLE.

25:05.274 --> 25:08.838
WE'RE GONNA RUN
SOME MORE TESTS, MA'AM.

25:08.838 --> 25:11.881
WE'RE... VERY SORRY.

25:11.881 --> 25:14.043
(voice breaks) THANK YOU.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.519
DR. STEVENS, CAN I
TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?
GO AWAY.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.521
PICKED UP THE LABS FOR YOU.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.054
IF YOU WANT, I CAN TAKE CARE
OF THE DIALYSIS.

25:25.054 --> 25:28.097
I'VE GOT THIS. I DON'T NEED
A SURGICAL BITCH. THANKS.

25:28.097 --> 25:30.099
IZZIE, IT WASN'T PERSONAL.

25:30.099 --> 25:33.903
THAT STUFF, IT JUST...
COMES WITH THE JOB.

25:33.903 --> 25:36.766
I'D EXPECT YOU TO DO
THE SAME THING TO ME.

25:36.766 --> 25:38.768
OUTSIDE OF WORK,
YOU CAN BE FRIENDS.

25:38.768 --> 25:41.210
BUT INSIDE,
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY.

25:41.210 --> 25:44.844
AT LEAST IT WAS
AT MERCY WEST.
WELL, THAT ISN'T
HOW IT IS HERE.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.846
HERE, WE DON'T JUST
THINK ABOUT OURSELVES.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.848
WE SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER.
WE HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.920
WE--WE THROW OURSELVES
IN FRONT OF BUSES

25:50.920 --> 25:54.053
TO SAVE THE LIVES
OF COMPLETE STRANGERS.

25:54.053 --> 25:58.227
YOU WILL NEVER MEASURE UP
TO THE PEOPLE WE'VE LOST.

26:00.329 --> 26:03.693
LET'S DO A 140-BASE SODIUM,
37-BASE BIOCARB

26:03.693 --> 26:05.935
AND A ZERO-K BATH

26:05.935 --> 26:08.297
WITH AN ULTRAFILTRATION
OF 3.5 LITERS.

26:08.297 --> 26:11.140
(sighs)

26:11.140 --> 26:14.143
THAT, I SUPPOSE, MAKES
EVERYTHING QUITE ALL RIGHT.

26:14.143 --> 26:16.776
(man) OH, THIS?

26:16.776 --> 26:19.248
(turns tv off)

26:21.110 --> 26:23.653
CRISTINA--
(sniffles and sobs)

26:23.653 --> 26:25.254
CRISTINA.
(crying)

26:25.254 --> 26:27.256
CRISTINA, TALK TO ME.
NO. (sobs)

26:27.256 --> 26:30.890
CRISTINA.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.892
HE WOULDN'T...
(sobbing)

26:32.892 --> 26:34.864
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:34.864 --> 26:37.867
(continues crying)

26:37.867 --> 26:39.268
OW.

26:39.268 --> 26:41.971
(continues crying)

26:41.971 --> 26:43.232
HERE.

26:43.232 --> 26:47.276
(continues crying)

26:47.276 --> 26:50.179
(sniffles)
TALK TO ME.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

26:50.179 --> 26:52.111
NOTHING.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.715
NOTHING IS HAPPENING TO ME.

26:55.715 --> 26:58.718
YOU KNOW, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.790
I'M, LIKE,
CHASING AFTER SURGERIES

27:00.790 --> 27:02.792
I DON'T CARE ABOUT.

27:04.353 --> 27:08.127
DO YOU KNOW
HOW LONG IT'S BEEN

27:08.127 --> 27:11.630
SINCE I'VE HELD A HEART
IN MY HAND...

27:11.630 --> 27:14.403
SINCE I FELT THAT...
(sobs)

27:14.403 --> 27:18.267
THAT JOY, THAT RUSH?

27:20.810 --> 27:22.672
(sniffles) YOU KNOW...

27:22.672 --> 27:24.774
I MISS BURKE.

27:24.774 --> 27:28.417
I-I M--I MISS HIM
ALL DAY.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.419
I MISS--YOU KNOW, I-I--

27:30.419 --> 27:33.122
IT'S--IT'S NOT THE RELATIONSHIP
OR--OR THE SEX.

27:33.122 --> 27:35.084
I MISS...

27:37.226 --> 27:41.130
EVERY DAY WHEN HE WAS HERE,
I HELD HEARTS.

27:41.130 --> 27:44.133
AND I GOT PICKED,
NOT BECAUSE OF SOME FAVORITISM,

27:44.133 --> 27:47.136
BUT BECAUSE IT WAS JUST,
LIKE, IT WAS RIGHT.

27:47.136 --> 27:50.239
AND I LEARNED. I LEARNED.

27:50.239 --> 27:52.241
(sighs)

27:54.303 --> 27:56.275
(sniffles)

27:56.275 --> 27:59.949
(exhales deeply)

27:59.949 --> 28:02.411
AND I FELT SEEN.

28:02.411 --> 28:06.085
AND NOW YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

28:06.085 --> 28:09.188
I SPENT
THIS ENTIRE DAY FIGHTING...

28:09.188 --> 28:12.421
(sighs)

28:12.421 --> 28:16.695
AND I-I DON'T WANT
TO DO IT ANYMORE.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.300
COME OVER HERE.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.302
(sniffles)

28:27.136 --> 28:30.309
(sighs)

28:36.986 --> 28:39.789
NO, I HAVE A METHOD
ALL MY OWN.

28:39.789 --> 28:41.791
UH, IF YOU'LL NOTICE,
THE COAT CAME FIRST,

28:41.791 --> 28:43.793
THEN THE TIE, THEN THE SHIRT.

28:43.793 --> 28:45.955
NOW, UH, ACCORDING TO HOYLE,

28:45.955 --> 28:48.197
AFTER THAT, THE, UH,
PANTS SHOULD BE NEXT.

28:48.197 --> 28:50.429
THERE'S WHERE I'M DIFFERENT.

28:59.268 --> 29:01.740
WHERE ARE WE AT
WITH BILLY SHEEHAN?
HE'S READY. I HELPED
PUT HIM UNDER.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.473
HE'S PREPPED AND POSITIONED.
I THOUGHT WE SAID
I WAS HANDLING THAT.

29:04.473 --> 29:07.476
OH, YEAH, WE DID. I JUST
WANTED TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE

29:07.476 --> 29:10.479
EVERYTHING WAS READY
FOR DR. SHEPHERD.
WELL, YOUR FIRST DAY HERE,

29:10.479 --> 29:13.752
AND ALREADY
YOU'RE MAKING MY LIFE EASIER.
YEAH, DR. KEPNER--NO,
SHE'S NOT JUST A GOOD DOCTOR.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.185
SHE'S--SHE'S A GREAT DOCTOR.
IN FACT, IF YOU ASK ME,

29:16.185 --> 29:18.027
SHE'S THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE.
(Derek) OH.

29:18.027 --> 29:20.359
ONLY YOU CAN KEEP
YOURSELF DOWN, RIGHT?

29:20.359 --> 29:22.361
BY THE WAY, I CAN TELL.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.794
(elevator bell dings)

29:24.794 --> 29:29.238
(voice breaks) D-DR. SHEPHERD,
I JUST NEED A MOMENT.

29:33.803 --> 29:35.304
LOOK AT THIS.

29:35.304 --> 29:37.306
ACUTE ON CHRONIC
SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

29:37.306 --> 29:38.978
THAT'S NOT METS.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.449
NO, IT'S A BRAIN BLEED.

29:40.449 --> 29:42.882
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
THE APHASIA AND THE NUMBNESS.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.114
IT WOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.
I'LL TELL NEURO.

29:45.114 --> 29:47.316
OH, NO. NICE TRY.
I'LL TELL NEURO.

29:47.316 --> 29:49.288
I'M THE ONE THAT SAID
IT WAS A BRAIN ISSUE.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.360
THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU KNEW
THAT WAS BECAUSE I GOT

29:51.360 --> 29:54.793
THE BALL ROLLING BY DIAGNOSING
THE CAROTID STENOSIS.
CAN'T YOU GIVE IT A REST?

29:54.793 --> 29:57.326
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
WHAT GOLDMAN'S DAUGHTER SAID?

29:57.326 --> 29:59.568
SORRY.

29:59.568 --> 30:01.570
I'LL STOP IF YOU STOP.

30:01.570 --> 30:04.273
I'VE STOPPED.
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

30:04.273 --> 30:07.977
TALK TO ARIZONA ROBBINS--
SHE'S HEAD OF NEURO.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.043
SHE'S NOT REALLY
HEAD OF NEURO, IS SHE?

30:15.985 --> 30:18.988
(monitor beeping erratically)
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?!

30:18.988 --> 30:20.990
PUSH ANOTHER 2
OF ATIVAN NOW.

30:20.990 --> 30:23.392
GET ME NEW CHEMISTRIES
AND AN E.K.G.
GET THE CRASH CART
IN HERE NOW.

30:23.392 --> 30:25.124
START VENTILATING HER.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.456
TORSADES?
YOU GAVE HER TORSADES?

30:27.456 --> 30:31.230
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO TO HER?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO WAS WITH HER LAST.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.232
PAGE BAILEY.
I ALREADY DID.

30:33.232 --> 30:35.834
(defibrillator whines)
CLEAR. CLEAR!

30:35.834 --> 30:38.437
(paddles thunk,
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

30:38.437 --> 30:41.440
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

30:48.918 --> 30:52.922
I DON'T KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH
TO TALK ABOUT HER.

30:52.922 --> 30:54.984
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT.

31:00.129 --> 31:03.192
MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT I WAS
NAMED FOR THE STATE,

31:03.192 --> 31:05.194
BUT IT'S NOT TRUE.

31:05.194 --> 31:08.867
I WAS NAMED FOR A BATTLESHIP--
THE "U.S.S. ARIZONA."

31:08.867 --> 31:10.869
MY GRANDFATHER
WAS SERVING ON THE ARIZONA

31:10.869 --> 31:12.871
WHEN THE JAPANESE
BOMBED PEARL HARBOR,

31:12.871 --> 31:16.075
AND HE SAVED... 19 MEN

31:16.075 --> 31:18.577
BEFORE HE DROWNED.

31:20.349 --> 31:23.352
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING
MY FATHER DID HIS WHOLE LIFE

31:23.352 --> 31:25.915
WAS ABOUT HONORING
THAT SACRIFICE.

31:25.915 --> 31:30.059
I WAS RAISED TO BE
A GOOD MAN IN A STORM,

31:30.059 --> 31:32.491
RAISED TO LOVE MY COUNTRY,

31:32.491 --> 31:33.993
LOVE MY FAMILY

31:33.993 --> 31:36.926
AND PROTECT THE THINGS
I LOVE.

31:36.926 --> 31:39.098
WHEN MY FATHER...

31:39.098 --> 31:42.501
COLONEL DANIEL ROBBINS OF
THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS,

31:42.501 --> 31:44.503
HEARD THAT I WAS A LESBIAN,

31:44.503 --> 31:48.377
HE SAID HE ONLY HAD
ONE QUESTION.

31:48.377 --> 31:50.379
I WAS PREPARED FOR

31:50.379 --> 31:55.344
"HOW FAST CAN YOU GET
THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE?"

31:55.344 --> 31:58.487
BUT INSTEAD...

31:58.487 --> 32:00.219
IT WAS...

32:00.219 --> 32:04.453
"ARE YOU STILL
WHO I RAISED YOU TO BE?"

32:07.096 --> 32:09.158
MY FATHER
BELIEVES IN COUNTRY

32:09.158 --> 32:11.600
THE WAY THAT YOU
BELIEVE IN GOD.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.303
AND MY FATHER IS NOT A MAN
WHO BENDS,

32:14.303 --> 32:18.367
BUT HE BENT FOR ME
BECAUSE I'M HIS DAUGHTER.

32:19.668 --> 32:23.712
I'M A GOOD MAN
IN A STORM.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.379
I LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER,

32:30.379 --> 32:34.423
AND I PROTECT
THE THINGS I LOVE.

32:34.423 --> 32:37.426
NOT THAT I NEED TO.
SHE DOESN'T NEED IT.

32:37.426 --> 32:41.130
SHE'S STRONG AND CARING...

32:41.130 --> 32:43.132
AND HONORABLE.

32:43.132 --> 32:47.536
(voice breaks) AND SHE'S
WHO YOU RAISED HER TO BE.

33:05.554 --> 33:08.017
SHE'S ALIVE, BARELY.

33:08.017 --> 33:10.019
IS SHE STILL
GONNA GET THE KIDNEY?

33:10.019 --> 33:12.021
I'M ASKING THE QUESTIONS
RIGHT NOW, STEVENS.

33:12.021 --> 33:15.024
DR. PERCY HERE TELLS ME
THAT YOU WERE IN CHARGE

33:15.024 --> 33:16.495
OF SARAH'S DIALYSIS.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.367
IS THAT TRUE?
YES.

33:18.367 --> 33:20.569
HE ALSO SAYS THAT YOU WERE
PRETTY UPSET WITH HIM.

33:20.569 --> 33:23.102
I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT
HAS TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

33:23.102 --> 33:26.105
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT
THAT YOUR MENTAL STATE

33:26.105 --> 33:28.037
MAY HAVE CLOUDED
YOUR JUDGMENT,

33:28.037 --> 33:30.709
MAY HAVE MADE YOU
A LESS COMPETENT DOCTOR,

33:30.709 --> 33:34.513
MAY HAVE LED YOU
TO READ THE LABS WRONG

33:34.513 --> 33:36.515
OR NOT READ THEM AT ALL.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.148
OTHERWISE, WHY WOULD YOU
TELL THE TECH

33:39.148 --> 33:42.121
TO GIVE SARAH A ZERO-K BATH

33:42.121 --> 33:47.356
WHEN HER POTASSIUM THIS MORNING
WAS 3.4?

33:49.228 --> 33:52.401
YOU SUCKED ALL THE POTASSIUM
OUT OF THAT WOMAN.

33:52.401 --> 33:54.503
YOU STOPPED HER HEART.

33:54.503 --> 33:58.237
SHE'S ALIVE, BUT SHE'S NOT
GETTING HER KIDNEY.

33:58.237 --> 34:01.110
AFTER THREE YEARS OF WAITING,

34:01.110 --> 34:03.672
SOMEBODY ELSE
WILL BE GETTING HER KIDNEY.

34:03.672 --> 34:06.375
AND IF WE DON'T FIND HER
ANOTHER ONE

34:06.375 --> 34:08.477
IN THE NEXT THREE DAYS,

34:08.477 --> 34:10.449
SHE'S GOING TO BE DEAD,

34:10.449 --> 34:13.382
AND YOU WILL HAVE KILLED HER.

34:34.103 --> 34:36.175
AH, THE SURGERY WENT
PRETTY WELL, MR. SHEEHAN.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.478
WE HAD GOOD BONE ALIGNMENT.
AND I'LL BE BACK
TO MY OLD SELF?

34:39.478 --> 34:41.480
I'LL BE ABLE
TO GET AROUND?

34:41.480 --> 34:42.781
GET AROUND? YES.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.554
UH, TO WHERE YOU WERE?
NO, PROBABLY NOT.

34:45.554 --> 34:47.386
PROBABLY ABOUT 70%,

34:47.386 --> 34:50.819
WHICH IS GOOD
CONSIDERING YOUR INJURIES.

34:50.819 --> 34:54.163
(police radio chatter)

34:54.163 --> 34:56.165
I GUESS THAT MEANS

34:56.165 --> 34:58.427
I ONLY STEAL
70% AS MUCH STUFF.

34:58.427 --> 34:59.568
BILLY...

35:07.276 --> 35:09.378
YOU SEE THIS?

35:09.378 --> 35:11.510
I NOTICED THIS AFTERNOON

35:11.510 --> 35:13.882
THERE WERE SPLOTCHES
ALL OVER THE PAGE,

35:13.882 --> 35:15.884
AND... THEY'RE TEARS.

35:15.884 --> 35:17.886
SHE WAS CRYING
WHEN SHE WROTE THIS STUFF.

35:17.886 --> 35:20.219
SHE'S SCARED.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.421
AND--AND THESE STUPID
LITTLE SAYINGS,

35:22.421 --> 35:24.523
THEY MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.

35:24.523 --> 35:27.156
THIS IS HER COMFORT.

35:27.156 --> 35:30.559
WE STOLE HER COMFORT
FROM HER.

35:30.559 --> 35:33.562
YOU AND ME, WE'RE--
WE'RE TAKING THINGS FROM PEOPLE,

35:33.562 --> 35:36.605
AND WE'RE LEAVING THEM
AT 70%.

35:43.442 --> 35:46.545
(crying) YOU PROMISED.

35:46.545 --> 35:50.819
YOU PROMISED MY NIECES
I WAS GETTING THIS KIDNEY.

35:50.819 --> 35:52.521
I'M SORRY.

35:52.521 --> 35:55.384
I AM... SO, SO SORRY.

35:55.384 --> 35:57.386
BUT I AM GOING
TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

35:57.386 --> 35:59.588
I'M GOING TO GET YOU
ANOTHER KIDNEY.

35:59.588 --> 36:01.460

36:01.460 --> 36:05.163

36:05.163 --> 36:06.665

36:06.665 --> 36:08.567
IT'S MY SISTER.

36:10.439 --> 36:13.472
WHAT DO I TELL HER?

36:17.446 --> 36:20.449
(pager beeping)

36:35.524 --> 36:36.965
I'M SORRY.

36:36.965 --> 36:38.597
(sighs)

36:38.597 --> 36:40.599
IT MUST BE HARD,
BEING THE NEW PEOPLE,

36:40.599 --> 36:43.602
BEING THE INVADERS.

36:43.602 --> 36:48.377
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE
FOR YOU BEING A...

36:48.377 --> 36:51.740
LOOK, I-I DON'T LIKE YOU.

36:51.740 --> 36:52.741
(chuckles)

36:52.741 --> 36:54.943
BUT WHAT I DID...

36:54.943 --> 36:57.486
THAT WAS OVER THE LINE.

37:08.897 --> 37:11.630
OH, I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

37:11.630 --> 37:16.605
THIS IS MISSY GRANT
FROM HUMAN RESOURCES.

37:19.708 --> 37:21.510
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

37:21.510 --> 37:23.672
YOU'RE FIRING ME?

37:23.672 --> 37:26.645
STEVENS--
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.917
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME FOR--
FOR HAVING CANCER.

37:28.917 --> 37:32.451
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
THAT'S FIVE KINDS OF ILLEGAL.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE CANCER.

37:34.283 --> 37:37.526
IT'S ABOUT
THE KIDNEY PATIENT?

37:37.526 --> 37:40.989
I MADE A MISTAKE. I...

37:40.989 --> 37:44.293
BUT DOCTORS MAKE MISTAKES
IN THIS HOSPITAL EVERY DAY.

37:44.293 --> 37:47.466
YES, BUT WHEN THERE'S--
YOU LET ME COME BACK
AFTER I CUT AN L-VAD WIRE.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.869
THAT WAS A DIFFERENT ERA.
TIMES HAVE CHANGED.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.842
DR. SHEPHERD AND DR. HUNT...

37:53.842 --> 37:55.904
HAD CONCERNS
ABOUT YOUR STAMINA

37:55.904 --> 37:58.347
AND EMOTIONAL STABILITY.

37:58.347 --> 38:01.450
AND DR. KAREV
HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT--
ALEX?

38:01.450 --> 38:03.612
ALEX SAID SOMETHING TO YOU?

38:03.612 --> 38:05.013

WITH MERCY WEST,

38:16.294 --> 38:19.498

HAVE CHANGED.

38:19.498 --> 38:23.472

IS EVALUATED...

38:23.472 --> 38:27.936
THE LARGEST CONSIDERATIONS
ARE BUDGETARY.

38:27.936 --> 38:31.510
THERE WAS SIMPLY
NO ROOM ON THE STAFF.
