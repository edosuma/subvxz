00:03.420 --> 00:06.964
- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
- Shh.

00:07.173 --> 00:10.009
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

00:10.552 --> 00:12.344
No, we're playing this game
I learned at work.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.097
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.933
What? That's, like, insanely easy.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.728
No, it's harder than it sounds.
You always forget at least one.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.106
Or in some cases, 14.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.943
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing
against other people...

00:28.111 --> 00:29.862
...so technically, I didn't lose.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.072
You forgot 14 states?

00:32.323 --> 00:34.658
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.494
Oh, okay, time's up.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.079
All right, I got 48.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.789
Oh, that's not bad. Pheebs?

00:40.999 --> 00:45.085
Oh, I got tired of naming states,
so I decided to list the types of celery.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.256
And I have one, regular celery.

00:50.341 --> 00:54.470
Okay, so Rachel's got 48
and Phoebe has the lead in...

00:55.597 --> 00:57.389
...vegetables. Joey?

00:57.766 --> 01:00.893
Say hello to the new champ
of Chandler's dumb states game.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.105
- Wow, how many you got?
- Fifty-six.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.482
Hey, how is New England not a state?

01:48.691 --> 01:50.859
Huh? They have a sports team.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.987
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

01:56.324 --> 01:57.783
There you go.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.787
How come we have
one extra place setting?

02:02.080 --> 02:06.416
- Because you invited your assistant.
- Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.502
His girlfriend came into town,
so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.

02:09.711 --> 02:10.795
Oh, why didn't you tell me?

02:10.964 --> 02:14.216
I made him his own individual
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.553
Oh, well, I was going to,
but then I figured, you know...

02:17.762 --> 02:21.014
...your food is so delicious
and perfect...

02:21.266 --> 02:24.560
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

02:25.270 --> 02:29.857
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that
because it is so fake, ha, ha, but I still do.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.818
Regular celery.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.862
Oh, I already have that.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.826
Done, with time to spare.

02:41.035 --> 02:45.706
- Ooh, this may be a new world's record.
- You know, I hate to lecture you guys...

02:45.957 --> 02:49.585
...but it's kind of disgraceful that
a group of well-educated adults...

02:49.836 --> 02:54.464
...and Joey, can't name all the states.

02:54.716 --> 03:00.095
You ever see a map or one of those
round colorful things called a globe?

03:00.471 --> 03:04.349
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.

03:04.559 --> 03:08.228
- What? That's impossible.
Forty-six.

03:08.479 --> 03:11.857
Well, who's well-educated now,
Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?

03:13.943 --> 03:15.944
I'm out of oven space.
I'm gonna go turn on Joey's.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.156
Please, watch him.
Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.033
I am only one man.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.871
- Okay, time is up.
- Give me another minute.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.208
Ross, if you don't know them by now,
you will never know them, okay?

03:29.417 --> 03:33.462
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.964
This is crazy. I can do this.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.635
All right, uh, I bet I can get
all 50, uh, before dinner.

03:39.844 --> 03:42.095
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.680
You're on.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.559
All right, don't look at my list, because
there's a lot on there that you don't have.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.397
Hey, did you guys know
your oven doesn't work?

03:52.607 --> 03:55.484
But the drawer full of takeout menus
is okay, right?

03:56.653 --> 03:59.488
- Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
- Shh.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.657
Chandler, give me a hand.

04:01.866 --> 04:07.079
Sure. Joey, do not let Ross look at any
maps or the globe in your apartment.

04:07.288 --> 04:10.249
Don't worry, Chandler.
It's not a globe of the United States.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.591
Hey, you guys, I'm gonna go out
and take a walk.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.095
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

04:23.304 --> 04:25.847
- Oh, it's not.
- Seriously, it's moving.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.559
- What the hell's in there?
- It's just my knitting. That's all.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.484
Yes, I knit this.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.612
I'm very good.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.453
Ross' apartment is nice.
Why don't we hang out here more often?

04:48.705 --> 04:50.455
I don't know.
Maybe because it smells weird.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.916
It's like old pumpkins or something.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.461
- That's my pie.
- Which smells delicious.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.964
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

04:59.173 --> 05:01.133
We left Joey alone with the food.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.593
Yep, yep, I knew it.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.429
There he is...

05:05.638 --> 05:08.765
...feeding stuffing to a dog.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.316
Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
How can I help?

05:18.067 --> 05:20.110
Phoebe, why is there a dog
in our apartment?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.112
I'm sorry, who's this?

05:22.613 --> 05:25.324
Phoebe, there's a dog
sitting on my couch.

05:25.533 --> 05:28.618
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.206
- No, there's no dog here.
- There is.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.584
He's black and white and shaggy.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.170
He's sitting next to Rachel
and licking Rachel's hand.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.881
Oh, my God. Where are you?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.301
I'll be right there.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.347
They're here already?
How are they doing this?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.605
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

05:56.814 --> 06:00.025
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend
Thanksgiving with you was still good.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.235
Well, sure. Come in.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.113
Well, what happened
to your girlfriend?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.574
We, uh, kind of broke up this morning.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.203
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.039
Ohio, thank you.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.212
Huh. Where's the dog?

06:20.421 --> 06:22.589
What dog? There's no dog here.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.883
Yeah, that dog left.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.428
Phoebe.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.263
Phoebe, open up.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.973
There's no dog in here.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.561
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.397
No, that's just me coughing.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.904
Oh, good. There you are.

06:46.155 --> 06:49.199
Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.284
What is it doing here?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.787
I'm watching it for friends
who went out of town.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.247
Wait.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.418
Hello, my name is Klunkers.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.754
May I please stay
with you nice people?

07:03.548 --> 07:07.134
Oh, I wish he could stay here,
but Chandler's allergic.

07:07.343 --> 07:09.136
Extremely allergic, okay?

07:09.387 --> 07:12.556
If I am anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

07:12.807 --> 07:15.392
...my throat will just close up.

07:15.601 --> 07:19.146
That's odd, because this dog's
been living here for the past three days.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.528
Really?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.573
If the dog has been here that long...

07:29.740 --> 07:32.576
...and you haven't had a reaction,
maybe you're not allergic to this dog.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.953
Well, it still has to go, right?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.329
Why?

07:37.415 --> 07:40.292
- Okay, it's, um...
- Don't do it.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.254
- Don't do what?
- I have to.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.756
Okay? It's time.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.596
Okay, I hate dogs.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.764
- What?
- That's crazy. Why?

07:56.434 --> 07:57.809
Told you.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.065
They are needy...

08:04.275 --> 08:07.194
...they are jumpy, and you can't tell
what they are thinking...

08:07.445 --> 08:09.905
...and that scares me a little bit.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.200
You're right. They are scary. Aah!

08:13.409 --> 08:16.786
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

08:18.456 --> 08:22.083
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs?
I mean, not even puppies?

08:22.293 --> 08:23.919
Is there a puppy here?

08:25.463 --> 08:28.298
- You don't like puppies?
- Okay, you are new.

08:32.345 --> 08:36.681
Look, Chandler, I told you.
Never tell anyone about this dog thing.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.850
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.730
- You don't like ice cream?
- It's too cold.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.859
Okay, it's just that dogs make me
a little uncomfortable.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.569
Hurts my teeth.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.948
I don't wanna say this.
I don't want you guys to hate me...

08:53.115 --> 08:56.576
...but, uh, I don't think I can be
around that dog anymore, okay?

08:56.827 --> 09:00.580
So either the dog goes or I go. Huh.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.755
Oh, my God.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.803
How can I not get this?

09:15.012 --> 09:18.557
I'm a college professor.
I got 1450 on my SATs.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.183
Twelve fifty.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.353
Damn, I forgot you were here.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.273
All right.
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.732
We'll be back in a minute.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.818
Oh, wait, before you go,
can I ask a question?

09:30.486 --> 09:32.821
Um, when a guy breaks up
with his girlfriend...

09:33.030 --> 09:37.117
...what is an appropriate amount of time
to wait before you make a move?

09:37.326 --> 09:38.994
Oh, I'd say about a month.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.414
- Really? I'd say three to four.
- Half-hour.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.169
Interesting.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.839
When it's your assistant,
I would say never.

09:51.048 --> 09:54.634
All right, Rach, the big question is,
does he like you?

09:54.844 --> 09:58.805
Right? Because if he doesn't like you,
this is all a moo point.

10:00.057 --> 10:03.184
Huh. A "moo" point?

10:05.229 --> 10:08.189
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.735
It just doesn't matter.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.697
It's "moo."

10:22.246 --> 10:25.707
Have I been living with him for too long,
or did that all just make sense?

10:26.834 --> 10:29.961
Please don't listen to Joey.
Okay? Would you look at him?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.922
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.799
He's spending Thanksgiving
with strangers.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.093
What he needs right now
is for you to be his friend.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.888
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.

10:40.097 --> 10:44.059
- Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
- Fine, take their advice.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.769
No one ever listens to me.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.481
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.697
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.491
How you holding up?

10:59.909 --> 11:01.409
- Not bad.
- Yeah?

11:01.619 --> 11:04.913
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
- Thanks.

11:05.164 --> 11:09.376
- Were you guys together a long time?
- A year, on and off.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.046
I thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.757
- Now that she broke up with you.
- Yeah.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.677
- Hmm.
- It's weird.

11:18.886 --> 11:23.306
I always used to assume that I would meet
someone and fall in love and be happy.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.602
That all that was just a given.
Well, lately, it's like, what if it's not?

11:28.270 --> 11:30.105
Do you ever have that feeling?

11:30.314 --> 11:31.815
No.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.483
Yeah.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.820
All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.

11:37.071 --> 11:40.323
But, you know, then I figure
it has to work out.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.325
Why?

11:43.077 --> 11:45.161
Because it has to.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.958
- You have all the answers, don't you?
- Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.796
- Hey, thanks for talking to me.
- Come on, what are bosses for?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.423
Hug it out.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.135
All right, he likes you back.

12:01.429 --> 12:05.181
Huh? Told you you should go for it.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.809
What?

12:11.522 --> 12:13.398
Street noise drown any of that out?

12:15.025 --> 12:17.485
No? All right, I'll see you later.
Ha, ha. Okay.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.826
What did Joey say? I like you back?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.704
Uh, yeah... You know, well, see, he...

12:28.748 --> 12:33.710
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

12:33.961 --> 12:37.213
And... And you were hugging me...

12:37.465 --> 12:41.593
...so obviously you are not
repulsed by it. Yeah. Heh.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.138
Wait a minute,
that doesn't make any sense.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.389
No?

12:49.560 --> 12:52.562
All right, here's the truth. Ahem.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.774
Joey said what he said because, um...

12:57.610 --> 12:59.319
...I'm attracted to you.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.490
- Wow.
- Yeah, I admit it.

13:03.866 --> 13:08.912
I have a crush on you. And, uh, I know
that's crazy because we work together...

13:09.163 --> 13:10.872
...and nothing could ever happen.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.500
And the last thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

13:13.709 --> 13:16.669
...or make you feel uncomfortable.

13:16.921 --> 13:21.424
Which is why it would be really great
if you said something right about now.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.261
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.264
- What?
- Right there. That's my car.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.643
- Hey!
- Okay, that's gonna take a minute.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.437
Do you have anything else
you wanna get off your chest?

13:34.605 --> 13:35.980
I can't believe this.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.901
Wait, we still have time to talk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.070
Oh, look, there they go. Okay.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.449
Okay, Phoebe.
We should probably go back now.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.369
Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.497
Stop it. Stop.

13:52.748 --> 13:56.459
- Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
- Yeah, okay.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.465
Oh, my God, did you hear that?
She said "Monica."

14:03.425 --> 14:06.052
Oh, I can't leave her.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.347
If you want, we could sneak the dog
back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.598
That's not gonna work.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.977
I had that dog there for three days
and Chandler had no idea.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.603
He's not so smart.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.398
Hey. I didn't know either.

14:18.607 --> 14:22.944
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

14:23.445 --> 14:24.904
Yeah, I knew. Heh.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.078
Where's Chandler?

14:33.414 --> 14:35.915
- Here I am.
- Wash your hands.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.878
How did you know?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.092
Hey, what's she doing back here?

14:46.302 --> 14:49.220
Relax, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

14:50.681 --> 14:54.267
Hey, look, Phoebe.
I, uh, laid out the states geographically.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.852
No, no, we don't have time for this.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.812
We have to keep Chandler
away from my room.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.147
Yeah, but, look what I...

14:59.315 --> 15:01.941
See, this is exactly
what we do not have time for.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.866
- Where's Monica?
- Uh, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.326
Why not?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.830
Monica's crying.

15:17.374 --> 15:21.169
She's very upset
about this whole Klunkers thing.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.505
- Well, I should go in there.
- No, no.

15:24.673 --> 15:28.217
No, she doesn't want to see you
right now.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.388
- Why not?
- Because you sent away the dog.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.892
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it? Is it?

15:37.728 --> 15:42.690
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.778
And, um, one day, my dad decides
he doesn't like dogs.

15:46.987 --> 15:50.949
So Monica and her friend... Phyllis...

15:52.159 --> 15:55.286
...take away the dog, and that was
the last time we ever saw him.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.957
Don't you see? This is just like that...

15:59.124 --> 16:03.002
...only with a few details changed.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.591
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.134
Bring on the food.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.140
- What's the matter?
- Monica's all upset...

16:16.308 --> 16:18.685
...because I sent Klunkers away.

16:18.852 --> 16:21.104
So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.066
Yeah, I could be a hero.
I could do that. I could... I could do...

16:25.317 --> 16:27.527
What if it...? What if it attacks me?

16:28.487 --> 16:30.780
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

16:32.866 --> 16:35.076
And that doesn't scare you?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.833
Ross, you need some help?

16:42.292 --> 16:43.334
From you?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.629
Yes, please.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.554
First of all, Utah?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.473
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.190
I hate America.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.944
When I finish this game,
I swear I am moving.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.157
- Hey. Tag still talking to the police?
- Yeah.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.910
Ugh, damn it. Why did I open my mouth?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.829
"I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you."

17:21.080 --> 17:23.207
I know that I freaked him out.

17:23.416 --> 17:26.002
If you said it like that,
you probably did, yeah.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.547
Hey, is Chandler here?

17:29.757 --> 17:32.133
Uh, no, no, he went for a walk.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.802
Okay, well, you cannot tell him,
but look who's back.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.265
- Hi.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.893
He went over to Ross'
to bring the dog back here.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.896
Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there.

17:46.857 --> 17:47.899
You think?

17:52.362 --> 17:53.446
Hi, honey.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.699
Please, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.868
- What? Why would...?
- Shh. Wait and see.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.370
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

18:02.498 --> 18:06.084
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to
bring back Klunkers, you know, for you...

18:06.251 --> 18:10.838
...and, ahem, I left the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

18:11.381 --> 18:15.593
And I looked everywhere, all over
the apartment, including the roof.

18:15.844 --> 18:19.764
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.059
I couldn't find him...

18:23.310 --> 18:27.230
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

18:27.481 --> 18:32.026
But I do know where we can all go
ease the pain.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.823
We have good news. Look who's back.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.574
Hi.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.827
Klunkers. Oh, my God.

18:40.994 --> 18:46.624
- That's right. She came back all by herself.
- It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.878
It is so good to see you.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.214
Yeah, she came all the way back
from Ross' building.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.175
Oh, the things she must've seen.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.553
Then she climbed up the fire escape...

18:58.804 --> 19:01.430
...and she tapped on the window
with her teeny little paw...

19:01.598 --> 19:03.516
...and we ran to let her in.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.270
I went too far, didn't I?

19:08.188 --> 19:10.189
When should I have stopped?

19:15.279 --> 19:20.116
Okay, maybe this is so hard
because there aren't 50 states.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.413
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.707
Now, there are no more.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.003
Now, I think I should be able
to eat something.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.213
It's up to you.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.888
- Oh, hi. How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

19:42.097 --> 19:45.099
I gotta go down to the police station
and look at mug shots.

19:45.309 --> 19:49.437
- Thanks for having me over, you guys.
- Tag, you're going? Uh...

19:49.605 --> 19:52.023
We didn't, uh, get a chance to talk.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.650
So where did you say you're from again?

19:54.860 --> 19:57.320
- Colorado.
- Ah, what good are you?

20:03.619 --> 20:07.496
Look, um, I think we should talk about
what happened on the terrace.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.081
- Okay.
- Uh...

20:09.249 --> 20:11.000
I never should've said what I said.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.211
You know what?
It just doesn't matter how I feel.

20:13.378 --> 20:17.465
We work together, so nothing could really
ever happen between us.

20:17.716 --> 20:22.595
What I would love is just to go to work
on Monday and never talk about this again.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.264
Okay? Big day, Monday. Lots to do.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.309
So we okay?

20:28.518 --> 20:30.686
Um, I'm not.

20:30.896 --> 20:34.232
- Oh, God, I knew it. I freaked you out.
- No, you didn't.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.609
The only thing that freaked me out
was you saying...

20:36.777 --> 20:38.694
...that nothing could happen between us.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.031
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.409
So please don't fire me
for doing this.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.673
Okay, well, that's one less thing
we have to do on Monday.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.654
Delaware.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.867
Delaware.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.621
- All right.
- I want my turkey now.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.707
You got it.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.006
You got Nevada twice.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.468
- I know.
- Yeah.
