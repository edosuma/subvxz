WEBVTT

00:05.875 --> 00:07.572
Ho! Hold on, Calvin.

00:07.616 --> 00:08.921
Got your mail.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.185
Brother, I'm glad you got a job.

00:11.228 --> 00:14.101
But nobody cares
about the damn mail anymore.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.624
It's packages.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.495
People want packages.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.367
Ooh, the mailis here!

00:19.410 --> 00:21.412
All right. What do you got
for me today, Randall?

00:21.456 --> 00:24.067
Pennysaver? Grocery store
coupons? Address labels

00:24.111 --> 00:27.679
that I did not order but
still very much appreciate?

00:27.723 --> 00:29.638
See, was that so hard?

00:32.293 --> 00:34.599
Bills, bills...

00:34.643 --> 00:37.037
bill-- Oh, hold up.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.735
Ooh, something good?
No.

00:39.778 --> 00:42.129
It's a summons
to report for jury duty.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.653
I got one, too.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.395
Yes! W--

00:47.438 --> 00:49.919
Wouldn't it be fun if we
ended up on the same trial?

00:49.962 --> 00:53.662
Not gonna happen
because I never saw this.

00:53.705 --> 00:56.012
H-Hold on.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.101
Calvin,
the system will fall apart

00:58.145 --> 00:59.885
if we don't do our civic duty.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.713
Well, I'm not trying
to be in the system.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.585
Next thing you know, I'm drafted

01:03.628 --> 01:07.110
in some hot-ass foreign country,
hopscotching over land mines.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.200
Okay, Calvin,
you can't just

01:10.244 --> 01:12.289
ignore an official
government document.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.162
You know, my uncle did that once
and it did not end well for him.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.946
Let me guess.

01:16.989 --> 01:20.036
He couldn't be the Grand Marshal
at the Pumpkin Parade?

01:20.080 --> 01:21.255
Well, yes.

01:22.473 --> 01:24.258
He was devastated.

01:24.301 --> 01:28.044
But, you know, he also had
to pay a $1,500 fine.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.265
That's pretty steep,
but I'll take my chances.

01:31.308 --> 01:34.616
And he spent five days
in the county jail.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.618
Wait.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.707
So either I send
someone to jail

01:38.750 --> 01:40.970
or I go to jail?

01:41.013 --> 01:42.928
Well, it looks like,
one way or the other,

01:42.972 --> 01:44.800
I'm gonna be doing time.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.369
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:48.412 --> 01:49.587
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:56.551 --> 01:58.683
Can you believe that we could
end up on the same trial?

01:58.727 --> 02:00.642
I mean, what are the odds?

02:00.685 --> 02:02.861
Hopefully impossible.

02:03.558 --> 02:04.733
Good morning, everyone.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.691
On behalf
of the City of Pasadena,

02:06.735 --> 02:08.780
thank you all
for doing your civic duty.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.174
Without you,
the system would fall apart.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.871
Ah, see.

02:13.742 --> 02:16.092
He gets it.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.226
We'll start with asking
a few questions to see

02:19.269 --> 02:21.489
if you can be fair
and impartial.

02:21.532 --> 02:22.968
Juror number six?

02:23.012 --> 02:24.274
Oh, hi.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.189
I'm juror number six,
but you can call me Dave.

02:27.277 --> 02:29.149
No one cares, Dave.

02:29.192 --> 02:32.021
I love jury duty.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.894
I'm a big believer
in the whole judicial system.

02:35.938 --> 02:39.507
It's the foundation
of our civilization.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.378
So if you need any jurors

02:41.422 --> 02:44.033
for, I don't know,
an upcoming trial,

02:44.076 --> 02:45.556
I'm in the system.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.905
Oh.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.864
Thank you.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.648
I'm fine with juror number six.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.694
[quietly]:
Yes.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.870
See, she gets it, too.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.132
Moving on.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.221
Juror number five,

02:58.265 --> 03:00.919
would you have any problems
being fair or impartial?

03:02.051 --> 03:03.531
Oh! [stammers]

03:03.574 --> 03:05.402
Uh...

03:05.446 --> 03:07.361
Yes.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.190
I have a problem
with the whole judicial system.

03:10.233 --> 03:14.324
It's designed to incarcerate
young brothers and sisters.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.245
Well, for-for the most part.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.990
Anything else that might exclude
you from being on this trial?

03:28.033 --> 03:30.297
Yes.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.255
I am pro crime.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.736
I am pro anti-crime.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.957
I'm pro police,
I am pro defund the police.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.395
And to top it all off,
this annoying guy

03:41.438 --> 03:43.223
next to me is
my neighbor, so...

03:43.266 --> 03:45.964
Uh, no, sorry, uh, actually,
we're best friends.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.097
Even worse, right?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.752
So I can understand why
you would need to disqualify me.

03:50.795 --> 03:51.970
Do you validate?

03:52.014 --> 03:53.755
Actually, none of those things

03:53.798 --> 03:55.626
are disqualifying for this case.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.149
Really?

03:57.193 --> 03:58.586
So what would disqualify me?

03:58.629 --> 04:02.590
Because I'm sure
I can be pro that, as well.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.070
I'm fine with juror number five.

04:05.810 --> 04:07.812
What?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.423
A-Anybody want to switch?

04:11.163 --> 04:14.166
How great is it that the
guys got jury duty together

04:14.210 --> 04:16.560
the same week I
have winter break?

04:16.604 --> 04:19.433
Gives us a chance to deliberate
over this rosé.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.957
And binge-watch
our Ladies Who Killshows.Mm-hmm.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.872
Ah, to wine and crime.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.177
Yes.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.311
Hey, Mom.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.965
Is it okay if Malcolm and I
raid your fridge?

04:30.008 --> 04:31.619
Well, what's wrong
with your fridge?

04:31.662 --> 04:33.316
Uh, remember I told you
we rented out our house

04:33.360 --> 04:35.013
for a few days
to a production company?

04:35.057 --> 04:36.972
Yeah, they're shooting
a small indie movie.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.452
It covers this
month's rent

04:38.495 --> 04:40.628
and allows us to take
a couple sick days.

04:40.671 --> 04:42.673
[both cough, laugh]

04:42.717 --> 04:44.284
Ooh, a movie.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.634
Maybe we'll get
a chance to meet a star.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.418
Not to brag,

04:48.462 --> 04:51.203
but you've kind of
already met one.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.249
Who?

04:54.729 --> 04:56.383
Me!

04:56.426 --> 04:58.950
I starred in Beauty and
the Beastin high school.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.388
♪ Tale as old

05:01.431 --> 05:02.780
♪ As time

05:02.824 --> 05:05.043
♪ Song as old as rhyme

05:05.087 --> 05:07.481
♪ Beauty

05:07.524 --> 05:11.311
♪ And the Beast.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.709
Why don't you be our guest
and never do that again.

05:18.753 --> 05:21.582
Well, uh, what are
they filming at your house?

05:21.625 --> 05:23.410
Oh, well, uh,
we don't know.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.499
Our rental contract says
that we can't bother them.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.239
Yeah, they wouldn't even
let us in our own kitchen.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.590
But, luckily, we
can bother you.

05:29.633 --> 05:30.895
[chuckles]

05:31.679 --> 05:34.203
Well, you know,
we didn't sign any contract.

05:34.246 --> 05:37.337
So what's stopping us from going
over there and checking it out?

05:37.380 --> 05:39.034
That is a great idea.
See?

05:39.077 --> 05:42.472
And who knows? Maybe I'll
finally get discovered.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.520
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

05:46.563 --> 05:48.522
we will prove
that this defendant

05:48.565 --> 05:51.394
is not
an innocent elderly shopper,

05:51.438 --> 05:54.136
but is
a professional shoplifter.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.878
We have her on camera

05:56.921 --> 05:58.619
driving away

05:58.662 --> 06:01.883
with thousands of dollars
of stolen merchandise.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.188
Guilty!

06:04.146 --> 06:05.539
What, too soon?

06:05.582 --> 06:07.323
Yes, Calvin,
way too soon.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.412
Uh, Your Honor,
request to have my friend's

06:09.456 --> 06:11.675
outburst stricken
from the record.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.591
No, you're not a lawyer.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.724
No, he is not.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.596
But I have watched over 200
episodes of Law & Order.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.338
And I'm sure you can
agree with me, Judge,

06:22.382 --> 06:25.559
that this whole thing
seems like a mistrial.

06:26.908 --> 06:29.737
And if you watch
that much Law & Order,

06:29.780 --> 06:32.130
you'd know that I'm the only one
who could say that.

06:32.174 --> 06:33.610
Sit down.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.093
Hey, hey! Hi, hi.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.616
My name is Tina and this is

06:39.660 --> 06:41.531
my friend Gemma, and...And we were wondering, um,

06:41.575 --> 06:45.230
if you need any more actors
to be in your movie, because...

06:45.274 --> 06:47.276
we're pros.Yeah.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.757
Well, you two are
perfect mom types.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.889
I guess I could use you,

06:51.933 --> 06:54.370
if you don't mind walking
back and forth in the background

06:54.414 --> 06:57.329
for five hours
in the hot sun for free.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.158
BOTH:
We'll take it!

07:00.202 --> 07:01.246
Great. See you on set.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.944
Okay. Oh, my God!

07:02.987 --> 07:04.380
We're gonna be in a movie!Yes!

07:04.424 --> 07:06.426
Hey.Hey, what's going on?

07:06.469 --> 07:08.863
Hi.
We just stopped by
to check on the house.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.125
Yeah, and help ourselves

07:10.168 --> 07:11.387
to some free food.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.954
Sorry to bother you.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.216
Bother not.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.304
[chuckles]

07:15.347 --> 07:16.479
I'm Jasmine.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.741
Can you tell me
where the set is?

07:17.785 --> 07:19.439
Um, it's this
house right here.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.397
Uh... [stammers] Hey.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.877
Um, I'm really into that.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.706
Uh, Mantamaji comics,
not your breasts.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.142
Um...

07:28.448 --> 07:30.145
I have the same thing.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.494
The-the shirt,
not breasts.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.148
Okay, all right,
all right, all right!

07:33.191 --> 07:34.628
Okay, let me,
let me jump in here.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.674
Um, this is my very single
and eligible son Marty.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.808
He gets a little flustered
around beautiful women.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.374
Mama!

07:43.767 --> 07:45.639
But she is not wrong.

07:45.682 --> 07:48.946
At least he didn't run
into a tree this time.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.471
Okay! Uh, I do have, uh...

07:51.514 --> 07:53.168
I do have some trouble
with English

07:53.211 --> 07:55.083
around lovely ladies.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.216
Too bad you don't speak
Klingon. [chuckles]

08:05.702 --> 08:08.488
Wow. She speaks Klingon.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.714
[laughs]

08:22.414 --> 08:23.764
They're talking
about babies!

08:23.807 --> 08:26.027
I know the word for babies
in every language

08:26.070 --> 08:27.202
in the universe!
Shh!
Oh...

08:27.245 --> 08:28.725
They're talking about babies!

08:32.294 --> 08:33.861
I say we get this thing
over with.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.036
I vote guilty.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.559
Okay, not so fast.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.866
Now, first, we need
to choose a foreman.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.695
So let's go around the room
and have each person discuss...

08:41.738 --> 08:44.219
I say Dave does it.
Show of hands.

08:44.262 --> 08:45.829
Yeah.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.222
Oh.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.311
Wow. Thank you
for your vote of confidence.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.966
I will not let you down.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.707
So now can I vote guilty?

08:53.750 --> 08:57.145
Well, as your newly
elected foreman,

08:57.188 --> 08:59.234
I feel like we need to discuss

08:59.277 --> 09:02.063
all aspects of the case
before we vote.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.847
How long is this gonna take?

09:03.891 --> 09:06.415
Well, not long, but we should
probably order dinner.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.199
And maybe breakfast.

09:09.026 --> 09:12.377
Uh, who wants to recall Dave
as foreman? Show of hands.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.468
Put your hands down, you jokers.

09:18.819 --> 09:22.257
Okay, now, before we start,
I feel like we should

09:22.300 --> 09:24.259
carefully review
all of the rules.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.739
Now, according to the bailiff,

09:25.782 --> 09:29.264
we press this button once
if we have a question,

09:29.307 --> 09:31.571
twice if we reach a verdict,

09:31.614 --> 09:34.443
and three times
if, well, there's an emergency.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.706
Well, somebody press it
three times,

09:36.750 --> 09:39.230
because Dave is about
to have an emergency!

09:39.274 --> 09:40.275
Oh, oh, hey, no.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.979
Marty, thanks for lunch.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.372
Ah, not a problem.

09:50.415 --> 09:51.939
That Mars rover can
guide itself for an hour.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.027
[chuckles] I hope.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.506
[both laugh]

09:54.550 --> 09:57.379
Jasmine, these last few days
have been amazing.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.468
I've never connected
with someone so quickly.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.775
It's almost like
we're perfect for each other.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.255
I feel the same way.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.605
Oh.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.695
Okay. All right.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.435
[laughs]Okay.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.699
Now, are-are you sure it's okay
for me to stay here and watch?

10:12.742 --> 10:14.483
Of course. I'm the star.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.746
And you're my guest.
Go over there.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.575
Okay.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.490
Quiet on set.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.405
Quiet on set.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.800
And action.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.062
[doorbell rings]

10:28.105 --> 10:30.020
Coming!

10:31.935 --> 10:33.807
You order a pizza?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.852
Extra sausage?

10:35.896 --> 10:38.115
I sure did.

10:39.508 --> 10:43.381
And I'm hungry
for more than just pizza.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.645
[funky '70s music playing]

10:58.658 --> 10:59.702
Are you two ready?

10:59.746 --> 11:01.269
Are you kidding?

11:01.312 --> 11:04.011
I've been dreaming about this
since I was a little girl.

11:04.054 --> 11:07.101
You'd be surprised
how often I hear that.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.712
You know,
when we're done shooting,

11:09.756 --> 11:12.759
I am gonna let you
sample my cupcakes.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.718
Honey, you already got the job.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.111
Let's get to work.

11:17.154 --> 11:18.895
Ooh!
[grunts excitedly]

11:18.939 --> 11:20.418
This is so fun.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.029
I can't believe he hired us
to walk the streets.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.726
I know.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.946
You know, I cannot wait until
my church sees me in this movie.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.469
Oh, yeah! [gasps]

11:27.512 --> 11:28.775
What?
Oh!

11:28.818 --> 11:29.993
Let's go. Let's hit it.Okay. [clears throat]

11:35.695 --> 11:38.567
This case is open
and shut, Tina.

11:38.610 --> 11:41.048
Dave had us deliberating
for three days.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.745
I didn't commit a crime.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.529
Why am I being punished?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.445
You know, Dave is right.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.448
You need to take your job
as a juror more seriously.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.407
You can't take this
for granted.

11:52.450 --> 11:53.930
You know, there was a time
they wouldn't even

11:53.974 --> 11:55.018
let Black people on juries.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.672
Yes, you know, I agree.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.283
And it's still
some of that going on.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.590
But I did my three days!

12:02.591 --> 12:04.201
Okay, all right, baby.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.769
Just imagine
if it were you on trial.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.336
Or even worse.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.859
What if it were our boys?

12:10.555 --> 12:13.167
Don't let the system work
without you.

12:14.603 --> 12:15.604
[smacks lips]

12:15.647 --> 12:17.824
I hate it when you
agree with Dave.

12:18.650 --> 12:21.566
I hate it even more
when I agree with Dave.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.049
Hmm.

12:26.093 --> 12:29.357
So cameras are here and here.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.403
Hmm.

12:32.447 --> 12:35.537
So she walks past
the perfume counter.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.062
"Uh, no, thank you, ma'am.
I already have that one."

12:40.542 --> 12:42.936
She comes on down past luggage.

12:42.979 --> 12:46.330
And she knew she wasn't gonna
get that in her purse, right?

12:47.157 --> 12:51.335
She goes on down
past women's accessories.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.990
Then though the Chanel display.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.951
Hold up. Hold up!

12:58.952 --> 13:00.257
That's it!

13:00.301 --> 13:03.695
[chuckles]:
Justice is blind.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.314
[chuckles]

13:15.795 --> 13:18.014
Whoa. What's wrong, little bro?

13:18.058 --> 13:20.625
Ah, did they make Pluto
a planet again?

13:20.669 --> 13:23.759
Worse. I found out what kind
of movie they're shooting.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.066
And it is not good.

13:26.109 --> 13:28.372
Okay, well, maybe they can
fix it in editing.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.853
I don't think they do a lot
of editing in these movies.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.115
Aah! Don't sit there.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.725
Or there.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.771
And definitely not there!

13:36.685 --> 13:39.383
They are shooting
an adult film in our house.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.211
When you say adult film,
do you mean...

13:41.255 --> 13:42.909
The name of the movie

13:42.952 --> 13:45.085
was Missionary Impossible.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.654
Well, bow chicka wow wow!
[laughs]

13:50.438 --> 13:52.179
Oh, look, whatever, Marty.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.922
All we have to do
is boil the house. Yeah.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.967
Oh, and, uh, make sure
Mama don't find out

13:58.011 --> 13:59.708
'cause, you know,
she will shut it all down.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.102
Yeah, man, but this
all has me messed up.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.930
I really like Jasmine.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.541
And she has a career
where she has to...

14:06.584 --> 14:08.325
order a lot of pizza.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.371
You know, I can't believe
they're still doing

14:10.414 --> 14:12.155
that tired old
pizza guy plot.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.331
Not the point!

14:14.375 --> 14:16.768
Listen, man, I know it's
her job, and-and that's cool,

14:16.812 --> 14:19.119
but I... I prefer a girl

14:19.162 --> 14:22.644
who only wants to
have pizza with me.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.952
Look, I know
what you mean, man.

14:25.995 --> 14:28.911
And we both know
you are not good with sharing.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.305
Like last night
with them tater tots.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.829
Excuse me, those
were all mine.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.353
And if you wanted tots, you
should've ordered your own!

14:38.747 --> 14:40.314
I was up all night

14:40.357 --> 14:42.533
going over this case in my mind,
and I have to admit

14:42.577 --> 14:45.885
that all the evidence
points to guilty.

14:45.928 --> 14:49.105
Calvin was right all along.

14:49.149 --> 14:51.281
I was wrong all along.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.371
She's innocent.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.025
What-- hold on, innocent?
What changed your mind?

14:56.069 --> 14:57.157
The spoon.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.333
I discovered

14:59.376 --> 15:03.293
that the cameras have
some blind spots.

15:03.337 --> 15:05.208
I-I didn't see any blind spots.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.907
That's how they got
their name, Dave.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.562
Look, the pictures show

15:11.606 --> 15:16.002
that there are security cameras
here and here,

15:16.045 --> 15:19.266
but not here.

15:19.309 --> 15:23.487
So no one knows
what the spoon was doing

15:23.531 --> 15:25.576
between luggage...

15:25.620 --> 15:27.274
and women's accessories.

15:28.449 --> 15:32.366
Anybody could've put
those stolen items in her purse.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.716
And if it's not on the cam,

15:34.759 --> 15:36.500
this case is a sham.

15:38.328 --> 15:41.723
So you're saying
there's reasonable doubt.

15:41.766 --> 15:45.074
I'm not just saying it, Dave.
I just rhymed it.

15:46.728 --> 15:49.165
Because if there is doubt,

15:49.209 --> 15:51.559
we got to let her out.

15:53.778 --> 15:56.607
Case... closed.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.046
[dramatic music sting]

16:04.050 --> 16:06.226
Hey, uh, Jasmine.

16:06.269 --> 16:07.488
I, um...

16:07.531 --> 16:10.273
Let me guess.
My job is too much for you?

16:10.317 --> 16:12.580
Yeah. How'd you know?

16:12.623 --> 16:15.017
[chuckles]
This isn't my first rodeo.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.411
I was in Rodeo Hoedown 8and 9.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.283
No, yeah, yeah, no.
[stammers]

16:20.327 --> 16:22.590
I checked your credits.
You are very popular.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.331
[chuckles]

16:24.374 --> 16:26.420
But, uh, I was wondering...

16:26.463 --> 16:28.465
Why I do this kind of work?

16:28.509 --> 16:29.597
Yeah.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.774
I know it's unusual,
but I enjoy it.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.471
That's why I invited you on set.

16:34.515 --> 16:37.822
To show you what I do because
some people don't get it.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.912
Like my priest-- so judgmental.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.263
[both laugh]

16:43.306 --> 16:44.960
But I've had some breakups

16:45.004 --> 16:48.094
because guys couldn't
handle it, so...

16:48.137 --> 16:50.444
if you're uncomfortable,

16:50.487 --> 16:52.663
we shouldn't
see each other anymore.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.404
What? N-No, no.

16:54.448 --> 16:57.668
Jasmine, those guys
are so shallow.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.757
I am mature.[chuckles]

16:59.801 --> 17:01.150
Okay? I-I can handle it.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.499
Yeah? Okay. [laughs][laughs]

17:02.543 --> 17:04.545
I'll see you on set, Jasmine.Okay.

17:05.546 --> 17:06.982
[door opens]

17:09.767 --> 17:11.030
Marty.

17:11.813 --> 17:12.814
Nope! Nope!

17:12.857 --> 17:15.034
I can't handle it.
[chuckles]

17:15.077 --> 17:16.296
I'm sorry.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.386
I-I really, really
wish that I could,

17:19.429 --> 17:20.865
but I... I guess

17:20.909 --> 17:22.824
I'm just looking for a different
kind of relationship.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.044
I understand.

17:31.441 --> 17:33.052
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

17:33.095 --> 17:35.315
Uh, we have, Your Honor.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.404
May the defendant please rise?

17:40.972 --> 17:42.322
I object!

17:42.365 --> 17:43.975
Habeas corpus!

17:44.019 --> 17:45.368
Sidebar!

17:46.848 --> 17:49.068
Uh, uh, Judge, some new evidence
has come to light.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.113
Scoot, scoot, scoot, scoot.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.593
I would say
"approach the bench,"

17:52.636 --> 17:54.551
but I see
you're already approaching.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.033
Habeas corpus.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.949
Semper fi.

18:00.992 --> 18:04.083
Your Honor,
if I may, uh...

18:05.040 --> 18:07.042
...this case

18:07.086 --> 18:09.262
is going downstream.

18:09.305 --> 18:13.266
I suggest you let us reconvene.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.881
I don't understand.
Guilty?

18:19.924 --> 18:22.144
A minute ago, you had us
all convinced she was innocent.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.016
That's before I noticed
that the defendant

18:25.060 --> 18:27.236
was wearing a Chanel necklace.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.412
I bought Tina one just like it.

18:29.456 --> 18:32.415
That thing was so expensive,
I wish I had stolen it.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.854
And here it is,
right here.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.378
This is the list

18:38.421 --> 18:40.858
of all of the stolen items
that were never recovered.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.077
There it is right there.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.384
One Chanel necklace.

18:44.427 --> 18:47.604
I guess she forgot
she had shoplifted it.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.915
Nice... catch.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.613
Looks like we get
to start all over again.

18:56.657 --> 18:59.094
No, no, no, no...Okay, now, here we go.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.748
Exhibit A.

19:00.791 --> 19:01.749
[knock on door]

19:01.792 --> 19:03.142
[stammers]

19:03.185 --> 19:04.839
You can all go home.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.884
What? Wh-Why?

19:06.928 --> 19:08.408
The defendant took a plea.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.280
When you objected, which
I don't think you can do...

19:12.977 --> 19:14.936
...she realized she was busted.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.807
What were you guys
doing in here?

19:16.851 --> 19:19.941
Me and the judge knew
she was guilty from day one.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.555
Well, Dave, I'm glad
you pushed me to do this.

19:25.599 --> 19:29.255
The system only works
when we all make sure it works.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.692
So you won't ignore
your summons next time?

19:31.735 --> 19:33.346
No. You know what?

19:33.389 --> 19:34.999
I'm actually looking forward

19:35.043 --> 19:37.698
to the next time
I get to do my civic duty.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.395
Maybe the next trial will have,

19:39.439 --> 19:41.919
like, more blood
or something in it,

19:41.963 --> 19:44.661
so I can finally use
my Law & Orderdegree.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.800
This is an outrage.Mm-hmm.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.890
You won't believe what
just happened on that movie set.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.848
Oh, right.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.807
Uh, I'm sorry, Ma.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.374
We just didn't know
how to tell you.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.333
Wait, you found out we
were fired before we did?

20:04.377 --> 20:05.465
Huh?

20:05.508 --> 20:08.163
After I let the director
eat my cupcakes?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.252
What the...

20:10.296 --> 20:12.123
Hold on. What is happening here?

20:12.167 --> 20:13.777
Were you two working
on that movie?

20:13.821 --> 20:16.171
Yeah! We were all up in it!

20:17.477 --> 20:20.523
But apparently, you're not
supposed to look in the camera.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.482
Oh!

20:22.525 --> 20:24.484
Mama, no!

20:24.527 --> 20:25.876
What?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.922
We were background actors
for the outside shots.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.316
So-so-so-so, you two were
outside the whole time

20:30.359 --> 20:32.274
and-and you never
saw in that house?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.667
No.
Oh, I wish.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.582
God, that would've
been the dream.
