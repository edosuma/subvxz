10:44.477 --> 10:48.397
{\an5}Wanda: WHY ARE WE
EVEN IN THE APES'
FORBIDDEN CITY ANYWAY?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.066
DIDN'T YOU
HEAR BIPPY?

10:50.149 --> 10:51.650
[HOOTING]

10:51.734 --> 10:52.777
HE SAID,
AND I QUOTE:

10:52.860 --> 10:54.195
"I WANT TO VISIT
THE FORBIDDEN CITY,

10:54.278 --> 10:55.571
"BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN CURIOUS

10:55.654 --> 10:58.574
{\an5}ABOUT WHAT THEY DO
WITH THE HUMANS
THEY CAPTURE."

10:58.657 --> 10:59.617
OR MAYBE HE JUST
WANTED A BANANA.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.661
I COULD HAVE BEEN
PARAPHRASING.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.414
EEE EEE EEE!

COSMO! WANDA!

11:15.007 --> 11:16.133
TIMMY!

11:15.007 --> 11:16.133
TIMMY!

11:16.217 --> 11:17.426
LISTEN TO ME.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.845
I WISH THE WORLD
WAS BACK TO NORMAL.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.680
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT US
TO DO ABOUT IT?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.682
WE'RE NOT
YOUR GODPARENTS ANYMORE.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.851
{\an1}WE'RE BIPPY'S.
AND THOSE ARE THE RULES.

11:30.314 --> 11:33.484
{\an5}IF I WERE TO EAT
A RULE-FREE
MAGIC MUFFIN...

11:46.539 --> 11:47.998
YES!

11:50.000 --> 11:55.881
NOOOOO!

11:57.341 --> 11:59.885
NOOOO!

12:29.748 --> 12:31.667
{\an5}Dad: OOH, HONEY,
I LOVE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE

12:31.750 --> 12:32.418
WITH THESE
LEOPARD PELTS.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.712
BUT I FEEL GUILTY.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.422
{\an1}WE DIDN'T MAKE
ANYTHING FOR TIMMY

12:36.505 --> 12:38.174
{\an1}OUT OF THESE
LEOPARD PELTS.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.967
WELL, WE DON'T
HAVE TO TELL HIM

12:40.050 --> 12:41.552
ABOUT THE LEOPARD
PELTS, DO WE?

12:41.635 --> 12:43.095
{\an1}BUT THEN
HOW DO WE EXPLAIN

12:43.179 --> 12:45.347
THE NEW LEOPARD COATS,
THE LEOPARD-SKIN RUGS,

12:45.431 --> 12:46.724
{\an1}AND THE JUICY
LEOPARD SANDWICHES

12:46.807 --> 12:48.392
{\an1}IN THE LEOPARD-LINED
REFRIGERATOR?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.060
THE LOTTERY!

12:50.144 --> 12:53.689
{\an4}ALL RIGHT,
BUT I'M COUNTING
IT ALL AS 5 LIES.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.942
WELL, THIS IS CERTAINLY
AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.360
BUT ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

12:58.444 --> 13:01.030
I FINALLY HAVE MY OWN APARTMENT
AWAY FROM MY MOTHER!

13:01.113 --> 13:02.781
{\an1}I SHALL HAVE
A DINNER PARTY ON FRIDAY.

DISSECTED YOU BY FRIDAY,

13:05.034 --> 13:08.204
{\an1}DO YOU WANT TO COME
TO MY FANCY DINNER PARTY?

13:08.287 --> 13:08.787
I'M SERVING SHRIMP PUFFS.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.707
SHRIMP PUFFS ARE GROSS.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.125
DISSECT ME? I GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE

13:13.209 --> 13:17.588
{\an5}BEFORE I'M CUT UP
AND/OR FORCED TO EAT
SHRIMP PUFFS!

13:20.508 --> 13:22.551
COME ON, BIPPY.
JOIN THE PARTY.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.392
[DOOR OPENS]

13:35.648 --> 13:38.192
NO, NO! DON'T TAKE ME!

13:38.275 --> 13:39.610

AAH!

13:49.203 --> 13:51.997
{\an5}WHAT ABOUT YOU?
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT SHRIMP PUFFS?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.333
HELP!

13:54.416 --> 13:56.919
EEE OOH OOH!
EEE OOH OOH!

14:02.466 --> 14:04.009
AH! A MUFFIN!

14:06.303 --> 14:09.056
{\an1}HMM, I'M NOT SCHEDULED
TO EAT UNTIL MARCH.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.433
I'D BETTER SAVE THIS.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.276
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

14:20.359 --> 14:22.528
SMUSH THAT BANANA
ON MY FOREHEAD?

14:25.489 --> 14:27.491
OH, COME ON!

EEE EEE EEE!

14:41.130 --> 14:44.550
{\an5}DON'T WORRY, TIMMY.
WE'LL GET YOU
OUT OF HERE.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.344
{\an1}WELL, HE COULD BE
PARAPHRASING.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.513
EEE!

14:53.183 --> 14:56.979
YES! I HOPE YOU TASTE
LIKE PUFFED-UP SHRIMP!

14:57.062 --> 14:59.064
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.024
EEE EEE EEE!

15:00.107 --> 15:02.484
YOU GOT IT, BIPPY!

15:28.594 --> 15:29.845
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:29.928 --> 15:32.139
MONKEYWORLD IS GONE,
AND HUMANS RULE AGAIN?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.682
IS THIS WHAT
BIPPY WISHED FOR?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.267
UH, IT WAS EITHER
"FREE TIMMY,

15:35.351 --> 15:37.478
{\an1}"MAKE HUMANS THE DOMINANT
SPECIES ON EARTH AGAIN,

15:37.561 --> 15:39.855
AND REMOVE ALL TRACES
OF MONKEYWORLD FROM THE PLANET,"

15:39.938 --> 15:40.939
OR SOMETHING
ABOUT WANTING A BANANA.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.692
I FORGET WHICH.
I MIGHT HAVE PARAPHRASED.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.319
I'M GLAD
THAT'S OVER WITH.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.071
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.447
WHERE'S
THE MAGIC MUFFIN?

15:48.530 --> 15:49.782
I THOUGHT YOU HAD IT.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.325

BIPPY HAD IT.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.630

16:04.713 --> 16:07.132

FOR ANYTHING!

FOR ONE LOUSY WISH,

AS MANY AS I WANT?!

16:30.989 --> 16:33.200

IS SAY THE MAGIC WORDS:

FIND CROCKER.

WE'VE SCRAMBLED
THE FAIRIES,

{\an1}WE CANNOT RISK ANOTHER FAIRY
BEING FAIRY-NAPPED

18:31.068 --> 18:33.529
{\an1}BY ONE OF THOSE
DESPICABLE BUTTERFLY NETS.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.955
{\an1}THERE! I HAVE
BLOWN UP THE BRIDGE

18:43.038 --> 18:45.040
{\an1}BETWEEN FAIRY WORLD
AND THE EARTH.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.042
UH, SIR, WE COULD
HAVE BLOWN THE BRIDGE

18:47.125 --> 18:48.710
WITHOUT SCRAMBLING
THE FAIRIES.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.295
{\an1}I LIKE TO SCRAMBLE
THE FAIRIES!

18:50.379 --> 18:53.549

22:21.298 --> 22:22.758
SQUEAK!

22:22.841 --> 22:24.551
[NEIGH]

22:50.118 --> 22:51.953
GO AHEAD AND RUN!

22:52.037 --> 22:55.123
{\an5}BUT THERE'S NOWHERE
IN THE WORLD YOU CAN
RUN TO WHEN IT'S...

22:55.207 --> 22:57.125
{\an1}<i>MY</i> WORLD!

23:18.063 --> 23:19.981
HEY, BOB,
BEAUTIFUL DAY, HUH?

23:20.065 --> 23:22.025
{\an1}YEAH, HOW ABOUT
THAT WEATHER?

23:23.568 --> 23:26.154
HEY, BOB, BEAUTIFUL DAY
TO WORSHIP CROCKER, HUH?

23:26.238 --> 23:28.156
{\an1}YEAH, HOW ABOUT
THAT CROCKER?

23:32.744 --> 23:35.205
Mom: WELL, INCLUDING
THE TIME I TOLD TIMMY

23:35.288 --> 23:36.998
{\an1}THAT HIS PET GERBIL
DIDN'T RUN AWAY

23:37.082 --> 23:39.126
{\an5}AND ACTUALLY WENT
ON AN ALL-EXPENSES-PAID
CARIBBEAN VACATION

23:39.209 --> 23:41.336
AND NEVER CAME BACK,

23:41.419 --> 23:44.589
WE'RE UP TO 14,012 LIES.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.091
HMM. MAKE IT 14,013.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.927
{\an5}I TOLD HIM
THAT HE COULD GROW UP
TO BE PRESIDENT.

23:49.010 --> 23:50.178
AND HE BELIEVED ME.
SWEET!

23:50.262 --> 23:52.514
WHY ISN'T IT SWEET?

23:52.597 --> 23:54.891
{\an1}MAYBE BECAUSE WE SHOULDN'T
FUDGE THE TRUTH

23:54.975 --> 23:57.686
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID
WE'LL HURT HIS FEELINGS.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.437
TIMMY TRUSTS US.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.106
MMM. TRUTH.

24:01.189 --> 24:03.191
CRAZY, BUT IT
JUST MIGHT WORK.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.156
I SURE HOPE THIS WORKS!

24:34.598 --> 24:38.643
Radio announcer:
GOOD MORNING, SLAVESDALE!

24:38.727 --> 24:42.314
TODAY'S WEATHER:
PARTLY CLOUDY WITH A 100% CHANCE

24:42.397 --> 24:45.901
OF YOU BOWING DOWN
TO CROCKER.

24:45.984 --> 24:49.988
THIS IS CHET YOU-BOW-DOWN
REMINDING YOU TO BOW DOWN.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.199
{\an1}COOL! SANTA'S MAGICAL BAG
PROTECTED US

24:52.282 --> 24:53.200
{\an1}FROM CROCKER'S
WORLD-CHANGING MAGIC.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.160
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

25:01.291 --> 25:02.876
HEY, WHAT'S
WITH THOSE CLOTHES

25:02.959 --> 25:04.878
THAT EXPRESS SOME
SORT OF INDIVIDUALITY?

25:04.961 --> 25:07.923
{\an4}NOW WE HAVE TO
TURN YOU OVER
TO CROCKER.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.090
WHAT? I'M YOUR SON!

25:09.174 --> 25:10.884
YOU CAN'T TURN ME
OVER TO CROCKER!

25:10.967 --> 25:11.593
HE'S INSANE!

25:11.676 --> 25:14.429
WELL, YOU ARE
OUR ONLY SON.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.057
I SUPPOSE WE COULD FORGIVE YOU
THIS ONE...

25:17.140 --> 25:19.935
TIMES TWO EQUALS TWO!

25:20.018 --> 25:22.687
{\an4}WHY WOULD I BE THINKING
ABOUT MULTIPLICATION
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

25:22.771 --> 25:25.565
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I DO THINK THAT...

25:25.649 --> 25:26.191
KITTENS ARE ADORABLE!

25:26.274 --> 25:28.944
LET'S GO FIND SOME!

25:29.861 --> 25:32.739
THE FORGET-ME-KNOB.
IT STILL WORKS!

25:32.822 --> 25:34.950
EVERYTHING MAGIC
STILL WORKS!

25:35.033 --> 25:37.327
GREAT. MY PARENTS
FINALLY DECIDE

25:37.410 --> 25:38.620
TO BE MORE TRUTHFUL

25:38.703 --> 25:40.997
JUST IN TIME FOR CROCKER
TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.415
{\an1}UNIVERSE.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.415
WHATEVER.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.541
IN A WORLD--

25:43.625 --> 25:45.043
{\an1}UNIVERSE.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.043
WHATEVER!

25:45.126 --> 25:47.128
IN A WORLD WHERE CROCKER
CONTROLS MAGIC,

25:47.212 --> 25:48.004
TRUTH MEANS NOTHING.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.966
CROCKER CAN MAKE
2 PLUS 2 EQUAL "FISH."

25:51.049 --> 25:52.259
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

25:52.342 --> 25:54.511
I'VE GOT TO SAVE WANDA,
SAVE THE WORLD,

25:54.594 --> 25:56.346
AND GET EVERYTHING
BACK TO NORMAL!

25:56.429 --> 25:59.140
{\an4}YEAH, BUT IN A WORLD
WHERE CROCKER CONTROLS
THE MAGIC

25:59.224 --> 26:00.642
AND I'M DUMBER
THAN USUAL...

26:00.725 --> 26:01.977

26:02.060 --> 26:04.020
{\an1}HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO BEAT HIM?

26:04.104 --> 26:06.231
WITH THE MUFFIN.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.341
COME ON, COSMO.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.011
