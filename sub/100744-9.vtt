WEBVTT

00:11.200 --> 00:13.440
[Uhtred] <i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:13.520 --> 00:17.360
<i>The battle for influence</i>
<i>threatens to break old alliances.</i>

00:17.440 --> 00:20.480
Edward is acting as if Mercia
is his kingdom and it is not!

00:20.560 --> 00:25.040
Perhaps being so far from home
has clouded your judgment.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.880
Return to Winchester and all will be well.

00:26.960 --> 00:31.920
[Uhtred] <i>As power shifts in Wessex,</i>
<i>Aelswith sees her plans take hold.</i>

00:32.000 --> 00:35.720
I would like to take Aethelstan to Bedwyn
and raise him there.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.760
Make the arrangements.
I will ask Uhtred to accompany you.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.920
[Uhtred] <i>Eardwulf’s treachery</i>
<i>has been exposed by his sister.</i>

00:44.000 --> 00:45.720
Save yourself.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.960
[Uhtred] <i>Without allies,</i>
<i>he seeks those who also desire revenge.</i>

00:52.040 --> 00:55.480
He is the turd who will help us
take Winchester

00:55.560 --> 00:58.880
without a single drop
of Danish blood being shed.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.960
[Uhtred] <i>I accepted an offer</i>
<i>to rule Mercia.</i>

01:02.040 --> 01:05.520
At long last I strike a bargain
with Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.720
[Uhtred] <i>But I knew</i>
<i>of a person more deserving.</i>

01:08.800 --> 01:11.160
As my first act as Lord of Mercia...

01:11.640 --> 01:14.240
I feel I have no choice
but to relinquish the throne...

01:14.320 --> 01:16.800
-[murmuring]
-...in favor of Lady Aethelflaed!

01:16.880 --> 01:20.320
Lady Aethelflaed cannot rule Mercia!

01:20.400 --> 01:23.240
[Uhtred] <i>Yet it was not without sacrifice.</i>

01:23.320 --> 01:28.520
I swear that as long as I hold
the Mercian throne, I will remain chaste.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.160
-[Ludeca] Is the Witan agreed?
-[Witan] Agreed!

01:31.240 --> 01:33.360
Then Lady Aethelflaed, take your throne.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.040
[cheering]

01:41.960 --> 01:43.400
[Uhtred] <i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:45.080 --> 01:46.600
[cheering]

01:49.880 --> 01:53.160
I will miss you, Uhtred Ragnarson.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.600
[cheering]

02:07.120 --> 02:10.280
[cheering and excited chattering]

02:16.480 --> 02:20.440
[cheering and crowd call out]

02:25.200 --> 02:27.400
[woman] Long live, Lady Aethelflaed!

02:27.480 --> 02:29.560
[cheering and happy laughter]

02:40.200 --> 02:43.360
[indistinct chattering]

02:44.560 --> 02:46.200
[pig oinks and chicken clucks]

03:02.000 --> 03:02.840
[groans]

03:04.480 --> 03:06.800
[guards groan]

03:06.880 --> 03:09.920
[panicked chattering]

03:10.000 --> 03:12.320
-[indistinct yelling]
-[screams]

03:15.920 --> 03:17.240
[Aethelhelm] What is that?

03:23.640 --> 03:25.400
[panicked yelling and screaming]

03:28.360 --> 03:30.280
[grunts and groans]

03:35.560 --> 03:37.920
[yelling and screaming]

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
Guards!

04:00.360 --> 04:02.200
[yelling and screaming]

04:04.560 --> 04:07.520
[panicked grunting]

04:07.600 --> 04:08.880
[Brida] Take the priests.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.400
[groaning and distant panicked yells]

04:28.600 --> 04:30.160
[groans]

04:33.200 --> 04:34.320
[whoosh of arrow]

04:38.200 --> 04:40.760
[distant yelling and screaming]

05:04.440 --> 05:07.160
[breathes heavily and groans]

05:08.720 --> 05:10.280
Don’t let them kill us.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.200
[whimpers and sobs softly]

05:26.440 --> 05:27.280
[Aelflaed sobs]

05:27.360 --> 05:29.120
I've been told you are in charge.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.120
[Aethelhelm] I am not the King.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.440
I'm aware you're not the king.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.560
Would you like to fight or to yield?

05:54.040 --> 05:56.520
[many approaching footsteps]

06:02.880 --> 06:04.080
Yield.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.440
[groans]

06:13.880 --> 06:15.320
-[grunts]
-[groans]

06:16.160 --> 06:18.280
-[sobs]
-[guards grunt and groan]

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
[groaning]

06:23.280 --> 06:25.480
[groaning]

06:29.760 --> 06:31.200
[Sigtryggr] Lock them up.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.560
[grunts]

06:41.480 --> 06:42.480
[grunts]

06:43.040 --> 06:45.680
[Brida laughs]

06:46.160 --> 06:48.960
-[Sigtryggr] Do we hold the town?
-Soon enough.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.360
We have ripped out the Saxon heart.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.800
So, it begins!

07:00.800 --> 07:02.760
[distant yelling]

07:05.000 --> 07:06.920
[indistinct shouting]

07:07.000 --> 07:09.360
-Ready yourselves.
-Take your positions.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.200
[ax chopping]

08:08.240 --> 08:10.600
[Pyrlig] Am I the only one
doing any work here?

08:11.080 --> 08:13.360
If I make the fire,
I’m not doing the cooking.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.440
[Finan] It’s such a privilege
to set up camp for Lady Aelswith.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.400
[Uhtred] Oh, yes. Edward honors us...

08:22.000 --> 08:23.160
[grunts]

08:23.240 --> 08:24.640
...escorting his mother.

08:25.960 --> 08:26.840
[sighs]

08:26.920 --> 08:29.120
[men chatter indistinctly]

08:31.880 --> 08:33.640
[Aelswith] When I arrive at Bedwyn,

08:33.720 --> 08:37.080
I will offer prayers of thanks
on your behalf.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.240
Yet I fear I will not be thankful.

08:41.039 --> 08:45.520
God worked through you, Uhtred.
You did not make your sacrifice alone.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.840
It was no sacrifice, no blood was spilt.

08:47.919 --> 08:49.039
Pyrlig, flint!

08:49.120 --> 08:53.000
[Aelswith] Yet you gave what was most
precious to you to the Mercian people.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.720
And for that, I will always be grateful.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.560
Are you Lady Aelswith’s man now?

08:57.640 --> 09:01.920
If you would turn to Christ, perhaps,
I could find a way to reward you properly.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.760
Then I shall go un-rewarded.
I will not pretend a faith I do not have.

09:07.800 --> 09:12.720
Whilst it is unlikely
that you and I will be friends...

09:13.440 --> 09:15.720
I do now see
how you might be of use to me.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.120
That is indeed touching.

09:19.440 --> 09:23.560
I meant in accomplishing the work
my husband started.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.880
I know now
that it means something to you...

09:28.480 --> 09:32.400
and I thought, if we could work together,
then perhaps--

09:32.480 --> 09:35.720
I cannot be part of your plan.
I have my own children to look to.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.240
What do you intend for the boy?

09:40.720 --> 09:46.000
Nothing. I just want to bring up
Alfred's bloodline, appropriately.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.560
Is that not right, Father Pyrlig?

09:48.640 --> 09:51.800
Uh, that is indeed what you say.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.360
I thought you were not interested
in her plan.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.880
I am not. I’ve played my part.

09:59.080 --> 10:01.880
The Dane-Slayer is now a Man of Peace.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.200
It is a great pity
Alfred is not here to witness it.

10:07.760 --> 10:12.040
My husband saw things in Uhtred
none of us understood.

10:12.120 --> 10:16.600
Lady, we all understood it.
I think it was just you that didn't.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.960
[Lady Aelswith] That will not be enough.
I feel the cold.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.360
Please go and cut some more.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.640
Of course, Lady.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.640
-It’s her way of showing she likes you.
-[laughs]

10:39.720 --> 10:40.960
Yeah.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.160
[Finan chuckles]

10:44.680 --> 10:45.640
[sighs]

10:47.160 --> 10:50.760
-[Stiorra] How long until we reach Bedwyn?
-With luck by tomorrow,

10:50.840 --> 10:53.200
if we do not keep stopping on the road
to pray.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.320
-Then we will go on to Coccham.
-Mm.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.280
-Is that not good news?
-It is.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
I do want to live alongside you, Father.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.320
It’s just... Coccham is small.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.360
And peaceful and safe.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.960
Could we not go to Winchester?
We were happy there.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.200
Have those riders been following us?

11:16.280 --> 11:18.360
No. We are just on a trading route.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.080
[flutter of birds]

11:26.400 --> 11:27.640
[twig snaps underfoot]

11:33.240 --> 11:34.440
And what about them?

11:42.400 --> 11:43.520
Lord!

11:48.400 --> 11:51.400
[horse neighs and grunts]

11:55.560 --> 11:56.840
What do they want?

11:56.920 --> 11:57.800
We will see.

11:58.560 --> 11:59.480
Stay calm.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.160
Looks like an ambush.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.800
Most definitely is an ambush.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.240
[Haesten] Uhtred, what a surprise!

12:15.720 --> 12:18.360
I heard you were heading south,
but I didn’t believe it.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.560
As ever, the gods are with you.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.440
We were in wait for the King.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.560
But now you will have to do.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.360
What do you want from us, Haesten?

12:30.440 --> 12:32.720
A gift, for my new lord.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.840
And who has this misfortune?

12:34.920 --> 12:38.240
Sigtryggr, the kin of Ivar the Boneless.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.640
A boy without reputation.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.840
Reputation will come.

12:43.320 --> 12:47.600
He has landed from Irland
and he wants all Danes to follow him.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.920
He delivered Brida from Wealas
and she has joined.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.000
She joined with Cnut.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.080
That did not go well for her.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.160
[chuckles]

12:56.240 --> 12:58.000
You've sworn to a boy, Haesten.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.680
Indeed. He is young.

13:01.560 --> 13:02.400
But...

13:04.120 --> 13:05.320
he is cunning.

13:07.400 --> 13:11.880
Whilst you played Lord and the Saxons
fought amongst themselves, he...

13:14.000 --> 13:15.600
captured Winchester!

13:15.680 --> 13:19.240
-No!
-Yes! Lady Aelswith, you’re going home!

13:19.320 --> 13:20.160
Take the girl, too.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.200
-No.
-You will not fight it!

13:25.800 --> 13:27.280
[breathes heavily]

13:28.720 --> 13:32.640
[pants and whimpers]

13:46.240 --> 13:49.600
[Haesten] Huh, I did not know you cared
so much for Alfred’s widow.

13:50.360 --> 13:53.280
Come now, Uhtred, we’re even. Hm?

13:54.360 --> 13:58.400
You took Cnut's boys from me.
I take these captives from you.

13:58.880 --> 13:59.720
[Finan] Lord!

14:00.240 --> 14:02.600
[grunting and angry murmuring]

14:02.680 --> 14:03.920
[Finan] Lord!

14:04.000 --> 14:07.280
-Listen to that pig squeal.
-[Finan] Lord, what do we do?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.800
We have to get out of this alive.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.080
Tie them. Leave them to die, slowly.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.160
Sigtryggr wants you dead.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.600
Then take me to him.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.560
I will be happy to fight him.

14:17.640 --> 14:21.080
And give him the reputation as the man
who killed the Dane-Slayer?

14:22.880 --> 14:23.720
No.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.280
I want that honor to be mine.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.960
[Edward] I fear it is too soon to leave.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.480
Should you not take the moment
to place your authority in Mercia?

14:46.560 --> 14:49.400
If Eoferwic is vulnerable,
we have an opportunity we cannot waste.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.120
Then I shall come. I cannot let you
take them on alone.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.320
Edward, please, I have the men
and the silver to do this for us both.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.760
You have spent too much time in Mercia

14:58.840 --> 15:02.440
and, as much as my men respect you,
one leader is enough for any army.

15:05.320 --> 15:10.920
It is agreed. I will return to Wessex
and Mercia has a Lady to make her proud.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.680
Thank you.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.880
I promise I will bring the troops
to Winchester

15:15.960 --> 15:18.280
as soon as we have secured
the northern border.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.400
And we will welcome your men as brothers.
I mean it.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.320
We take Eoferwic
and our father's dream is revived.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.280
We banish the Danes within our lifetime.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.480
[raucous laughter]

15:33.560 --> 15:36.720
Oh! I am told
this is a peaceful way to die.

15:38.520 --> 15:43.000
You go into something of a sleep,
like a night with too much ale.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.600
[Haesten chuckles]

15:44.920 --> 15:48.760
It will give you a chance to dream,
Uhtred.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.440
And how you were finally defeated...

15:55.680 --> 15:57.680
[whispers] ...by the mighty Haesten!

15:57.760 --> 15:58.960
Oh-ho-ho!

15:59.040 --> 16:00.160
-[men] Oh!
-[laughter]

16:00.240 --> 16:04.360
Oh, such a great warrior, huh?

16:04.800 --> 16:07.800
Here's your sword. Come and retrieve it.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.840
No? [chuckles]

16:11.800 --> 16:14.800
You two, stay here
and report which one dies first.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.040
[laughs]

16:17.120 --> 16:20.680
And if they take too long to die,
slit their throats like hogs.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.360
-[man] Yes, Haesten.
-[laughter]

16:23.440 --> 16:26.440
[chuckles ] Come, we return
the Queen to her palace

16:26.520 --> 16:29.960
and finally get to see how much
King Edward<i> really </i>loves his mother.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.920
[raucous laughter]

16:35.960 --> 16:37.120
[grunting and laughter]

16:37.200 --> 16:38.120
[groans]

16:38.200 --> 16:40.960
-Calm down, Sihtric.
-[yelling and clatter of hooves]

16:41.040 --> 16:43.400
-You will need your energy.
-[Sihtric groans]

16:58.040 --> 16:59.120
[indistinct chatter]

16:59.200 --> 17:01.760
[Brida] Look at him,
stealing from the dead.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.200
Does he not feel rewarded?

17:06.160 --> 17:10.640
It certainly suggests he does not
trust us, which is probably wise of him.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.359
I do not like him. He is too fawning.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.640
-Yes, he’s an arse-licker.
-Hm.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.240
But his word was good
and now we have the prize.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.240
We should make a plan.

17:23.319 --> 17:24.319
A plan for?

17:24.400 --> 17:25.560
How we destroy them...

17:26.400 --> 17:30.720
the town, their holy places...
everything that makes them who they are.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.440
And what makes Edward who he is?

17:33.520 --> 17:36.400
He’s not the enemy his father was,
but like all Saxons,

17:36.480 --> 17:38.240
he’s made weak by his God.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.360
Hurt their faith and you hurt them.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.040
Start with their dead.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.200
Unbury them. Dig them up.
[chuckles] They will hate that.

17:47.280 --> 17:52.400
-Hm, I think we wait, see how they react.
-And let the Saxons take the lead?

17:52.480 --> 17:55.920
You let them take the lead,
they reveal who their true leaders are.

17:56.560 --> 17:58.360
And then you take those men first.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.280
And then we will be
taking the Dane-Slayer.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.400
And you will get what you want.

18:04.880 --> 18:05.760
[Uhtred] <i>Sihtric.</i>

18:06.280 --> 18:07.200
[Sihtric groans]

18:07.280 --> 18:08.880
-Sihtric.
-Yes.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.080
Stay awake.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.280
[grunts and groans]

18:11.360 --> 18:13.720
Sihtric! Stay awake!

18:13.800 --> 18:16.080
-[groans]
-Okay, look at me. You’ll be fine.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.760
-[laughter]
-[Finan] Lambs waiting for the slaughter.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.960
-[woman screams in distance]
-[Dame] Huh?

18:21.040 --> 18:22.480
[Sihtric groans]

18:22.560 --> 18:23.920
[woman screams]

18:24.000 --> 18:26.360
-I'll go.
-[muttering]

18:26.440 --> 18:27.720
[Sihtric groans]

18:27.800 --> 18:30.680
-[Uhtred] Can you reach the knot?
-[Finan] The ropes are too tight.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.640
[whimpers and screams]

18:46.400 --> 18:47.440
Lady?

18:48.960 --> 18:49.960
[groans]

18:52.280 --> 18:53.880
[grunts and groans]

18:54.840 --> 18:56.200
[groans]

18:59.440 --> 19:01.400
[grunts and groans]

19:05.600 --> 19:06.520
[Dane] Orm!

19:08.280 --> 19:09.120
Orm?

19:10.560 --> 19:11.400
Where are you?

19:12.240 --> 19:13.240
[breathes heavily]

19:16.640 --> 19:17.480
[Dane] Orm?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.640
Orm, where did you go?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.040
Orm?

19:26.320 --> 19:27.200
Orm!

19:28.720 --> 19:30.840
-[Finan] I tried.
-[Eadith pants]

19:30.920 --> 19:34.160
-Eadith, quickly! Go to Sihtric.
-[pants] All right.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.320
[Eadith pants]

19:38.400 --> 19:40.760
[Pyrlig] That’s it.
Release his hands first.

19:42.520 --> 19:45.760
-Faster.
-[Eadith grunts and pants]

19:47.600 --> 19:48.680
[Finan] Hurry up.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.960
[Eadith grunts]

19:52.320 --> 19:55.160
-[Eadith grunts]
-Make him fall, why don’t you?

19:56.160 --> 19:58.720
-[Uhtred] Thank you! Pyrlig next.
-[Finan] Is he?

20:00.440 --> 20:03.640
-[Uhtred] Wake up, Sihtric!
-[groans and pants]

20:03.720 --> 20:05.320
-[grunts]
-[Pyrlig] You're safe.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.480
[Dane roars]

20:06.560 --> 20:08.560
-[Finan] Kill him, Sihtric!
-[yelling]

20:08.640 --> 20:10.120
[Finan] Kill the bastard!

20:10.200 --> 20:12.840
[grunting and groaning]

20:15.960 --> 20:17.080
[Dane grunts angrily]

20:19.040 --> 20:21.400
-[both grunt]
-[Sihtric] Oh, thank you.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.520
-[Eadith screams]
-[grunting]

20:29.600 --> 20:30.520
You’re an angel.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.200
[yelling and grunting]

20:33.920 --> 20:36.720
[grunts and groans]

20:36.800 --> 20:38.680
[panting and grunting]

20:38.760 --> 20:40.000
[Osferth] Coming, Lord.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.640
[grunting and muttering]

20:44.240 --> 20:47.880
[grunting and panting]

20:47.960 --> 20:49.600
[groans]

20:49.680 --> 20:52.040
[all pant and groan]

20:55.200 --> 20:57.560
Move! They cannot have taken them far!

20:57.640 --> 20:59.600
[panting and grunting]

20:59.680 --> 21:02.640
--They’ve taken the horses, Lord.
-Ah!

21:02.720 --> 21:03.880
We must get to Stiorra!

21:03.960 --> 21:05.960
[Finan] Lord, they do not know
she’s your daughter.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.880
Pyrlig, find Edward.
Tell him what has happened here.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.840
-Yes, Lord.
-We go ahead to Winchester.

21:10.920 --> 21:13.320
They will not take what is not theirs,
not whilst I live!

21:13.400 --> 21:15.680
-[pants] Lord!
-What?

21:15.760 --> 21:17.360
-[grunts]
-Run!

21:17.440 --> 21:20.640
[all pant and grunt]

21:20.720 --> 21:22.080
Let’s go.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.080
[grunts softly]

22:21.480 --> 22:22.440
[man clears throat]

22:26.160 --> 22:27.000
[Brida] What?

22:36.160 --> 22:38.600
-[Aethelhelm inhales and exhales]
-Hm?

22:40.560 --> 22:44.960
I want to strike a bargain.
I am a very rich man.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.160
[Brida grunts]

22:49.160 --> 22:51.800
-And?
-[clears throat and breathes heavily]

22:53.280 --> 22:57.080
And I can offer you more silver than
you... [grunts softly]

22:57.160 --> 22:59.360
I have lived without
the comfort of silver.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.840
I only want one thing
and that you cannot give.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.560
-What? Perhaps.
-Revenge.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.960
Oh. On whom?

23:11.120 --> 23:13.680
[coughs and wheezes]

23:14.760 --> 23:15.720
All of you.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.200
[coughs]

23:18.280 --> 23:19.600
[receding footsteps]

23:19.680 --> 23:21.160
[hinges creak and door slams]

23:21.240 --> 23:23.240
[indistinct shouting]

23:34.080 --> 23:35.880
I get to Winchester at last.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.760
[Aelswith] Do not look on it.
It is not the place I left.

23:39.440 --> 23:43.840
Be under no illusion. They will murder us.
So, I suggest you say your prayers

23:43.920 --> 23:45.720
and thank the Lord
for the lives you’ve led.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.160
I will not. I'm not a Christian.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.640
Speak nothing
of how we vanquished the Dane-Slayer.

23:59.720 --> 24:03.200
We collect our reward from Sigtryggr
and leave this place with silver.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.920
Only then do we let it be known
who the true warriors are!

24:10.480 --> 24:11.720
[door opens]

24:21.760 --> 24:22.960
Lady Aelswith.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.240
I’m so happy to see your family re-united.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.960
I want to speak with whoever leads you.

24:29.880 --> 24:30.840
I lead here.

24:31.400 --> 24:35.160
-I mean, the man in charge of this.
-[Brida chuckles]

24:39.360 --> 24:40.400
[spits]

24:43.080 --> 24:44.480
Do not insult me.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.320
I am not the one using insults.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.640
But I am giving you a warning.

24:50.720 --> 24:53.520
This incursion will not be tolerated.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.720
My son will burn us all to the ground...

24:58.200 --> 25:02.000
before he concedes
one square of Wessex land.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.240
You are a pack of fools...

25:06.840 --> 25:11.840
unknowingly, you have trapped yourselves
within these walls.

25:11.920 --> 25:15.080
For once,
the heathen are all in one place.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.800
And when the fire comes,
as come it shall...

25:23.000 --> 25:27.480
we will watch your souls burn
as we ascend!

25:28.360 --> 25:29.200
[scoffs]

25:40.480 --> 25:42.680
Have her servant girl feed her shit.

25:43.480 --> 25:47.200
Torture me by all means, but you must know
that she and the boy are Danes.

25:49.360 --> 25:53.480
They were taken, as slaves,
after our victory at Tettanhall.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.000
If you value your people, take them back.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.160
Who is Sjofn?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.360
Handmaiden of Frigga.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.600
She is half Dane at most.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.800
The monk boy not at all.

26:13.320 --> 26:16.320
Half Dane is enough.
Hold the young woman separately.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.560
She’s Uhtred's daughter. I recognize her.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.600
We met in Mercia
when my sister betrayed me.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.520
I’ve never seen you before.

26:25.600 --> 26:29.040
Of course, she has his look.
And she is cunning like him.

26:30.680 --> 26:33.360
Find Uhtred. Send him her head.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.160
-[Aelswith] No!
-Do it. It will bring him.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.400
It will bring them all
and the end will begin!

26:43.360 --> 26:44.240
What?

26:45.760 --> 26:47.560
I thought you welcomed the fire.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.800
Put the Queen and the others back
where they keep their dead king.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.040
She comes with me.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.200
-[grunting]
-[gasps]

26:58.560 --> 27:00.040
[whimpering]

27:09.680 --> 27:11.720
[panting]

27:23.640 --> 27:25.440
-[distant yelling]
-What is it?

27:25.520 --> 27:27.320
[all pant]

27:27.400 --> 27:29.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

27:29.480 --> 27:32.320
-Oh, dear God!
-[distant Dane] Quick, up on the ramparts.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.320
This does not mean they’re dead.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.600
Stiorra's strong.
She'll have kept herself hidden.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.240
[distant yelling]

27:47.320 --> 27:49.680
[Sihtric] Why have they strengthened
their defenses?

27:50.200 --> 27:52.320
They could be preparing for a siege.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.920
-I thought that Danes did not like sieges.
-[Uhtred] Yes.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.840
Perhaps Sigtryggr learned something
in Irland.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.760
He's cunning.
Maybe he changes the strategy.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.440
Strategy or not, there’s too many of them.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.280
What if we cannot find a way in?

28:12.600 --> 28:14.720
If Sigtryggr fought the Irish,

28:14.800 --> 28:17.160
he’ll know what hard bastards we are

28:17.240 --> 28:23.400
and how we do not give up,
even when it looks completely impossible.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.600
[door opens]

28:25.880 --> 28:27.840
[grunts and breathes heavily]

28:29.320 --> 28:30.600
[Sigtryggr] Do not.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.800
[Stiorra breathes heavily]

28:36.160 --> 28:38.720
[Sigtryggr] I will not harm you. Do not.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.320
I only wish to speak with you.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.960
Answer me truthfully
and I will treat you kindly.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.880
I’ve heard of men's <i>kindness</i>
and I do not want it. [pants]

28:57.600 --> 28:59.400
I am the Dane who took Winchester.

28:59.480 --> 29:03.160
If I wanted to hump a woman,
I would not need to use force.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.720
[inhales deeply]

29:19.600 --> 29:20.960
Who was your mother?

29:21.800 --> 29:24.600
Gisela, sister of Guthred of Northumbria.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.760
Oh, so we share the same ancestors.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.080
Yet we’re not the same.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.040
And where is your home?

29:31.040 --> 29:32.320
Bebbanburg.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.320
A young woman with land in the north.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.040
Our lands were stolen,
but my father will see them restored.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.400
Hm, so, are you one of us, or one of them?

29:40.480 --> 29:41.640
I’m both!

29:42.160 --> 29:45.200
As are many living here,
two generations, three.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.400
This foolishness
of who is Saxon and who is Dane!

29:48.480 --> 29:52.360
When one side seeks to destroy the other,
you must choose in order to survive.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.440
Well, I refuse. It’s a game for old men.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.040
I won’t be held to the feuds
from years ago.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.280
I have no fight with either side
and I will not choose.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.400
It would dishonor either my father
or my mother.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.920
Well, then, I would say this love of honor
makes you a Dane.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.200
The Saxon cares only for obedience
to their God.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.280
Then you know nothing of Saxons.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.360
They treasure honor as much as you do.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.800
Yet they say
their god is the god of peace.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.480
Do you also believe them when they say
their god came back from the dead?

30:24.560 --> 30:26.120
[Sigtryggr laughs]

30:29.720 --> 30:32.280
Do you think there could be peace
between Saxon and Dane?

30:33.480 --> 30:36.120
They are new to me.
I wish to understand their ways.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.560
Many would like there to be.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.960
Tell me of your father Uhtred.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.160
Why does he hate us?

30:44.240 --> 30:47.400
-He doesn't.
-Then why does he kill so many of my kin?

30:47.480 --> 30:49.680
Why does he revel in his title
Dane-Slayer?

30:49.760 --> 30:51.720
He doesn’t revel in it. He hates it.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.280
You speak like a man who’s never killed.

30:54.360 --> 30:56.480
Oh, I have killed, but only Christians.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.000
I would never betray my people.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.840
He’s never betrayed anyone.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.880
He was often torn between those
who loved him like their own

31:05.960 --> 31:07.520
and those were his blood.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.160
My mother was a Dane and he loved her.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.480
If Uhtred were intent
on destroying the Danes,

31:13.560 --> 31:17.160
to clean us from the land,
why am I here to speak of it?

31:20.080 --> 31:20.960
[distant yelling]

31:21.040 --> 31:24.200
-We could enter with those villagers.
-[Finan] We should do it now then.

31:24.280 --> 31:26.520
If they get that food in
and close the gate.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.920
But, Lord, you are known here.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.640
We’re all known here.
This plan will not work.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.720
Someone would betray us
in return for their own safety.

31:36.680 --> 31:38.440
-[sighs]
-I could go in.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.240
I’ve not been here. I will not be noticed.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.920
It is a journey with no quick return.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.440
I can survive a siege. I will find out
where the captives are being kept

31:48.520 --> 31:51.240
and when you breach the walls,
you will know where to look for them.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.880
That could save them
if it comes to a fight.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.440
Mm.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.160
Uh, you do not have to do this.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.000
No, no, I will.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.680
[Finan] We will get you provisions.
You cannot go empty handed.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.640
They will close the gates.
There will be no way out.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.120
I know. It will bring them comfort
to know that you are here.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.760
[distant chattering and shouting]

32:25.320 --> 32:27.680
[indistinct chattering]

32:30.920 --> 32:32.240
[Edward] To Wessex.

32:33.640 --> 32:34.840
[chuckling]

32:41.720 --> 32:42.680
Both?

32:43.960 --> 32:46.520
-[Pyrlig] If they are--
-Both my heirs?

32:46.880 --> 32:50.680
Lord, assuming Aelfweard was at the palace
with the Queen, yes.

32:50.760 --> 32:54.640
[Edward breathes heavily]

32:54.720 --> 32:58.320
Why... why did Uhtred not protect
those on the road?

32:58.400 --> 33:01.040
He tried.
There were too many to fight off.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.760
[Edward] Too many...

33:05.320 --> 33:08.480
[exhales] Did... did someone betray me?

33:10.800 --> 33:13.640
-Betray, Lord?
-The Danes do not act by stealth!

33:13.720 --> 33:14.920
[sighs] Lord--

33:15.000 --> 33:17.720
They must have been told
we were absent from Winchester.

33:18.160 --> 33:21.120
Lord, your presence in Mercia
was never hidden.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.560
Are you suggesting it is my fault?

33:25.360 --> 33:26.200
Hm?

33:27.840 --> 33:31.400
That I have failed my people
worse than any king, hm?

33:32.560 --> 33:37.040
That I am more stupid and more foolish
than any who came before me?

33:45.200 --> 33:47.320
Ready my men. Raise the Fyrd!

33:47.400 --> 33:48.800
Raise the Mercian Guard!

33:49.280 --> 33:51.000
Raise the dead for all I care!

33:51.080 --> 33:53.040
Winchester <i>will</i> be retaken!

33:56.600 --> 33:59.160
[indistinct yelling and grunting]

34:07.400 --> 34:08.480
[grunting]

34:10.040 --> 34:12.400
Perhaps this man was a great warrior.
What do you think?

34:12.480 --> 34:14.159
-I demand you make them stop this!
-Why?

34:14.239 --> 34:17.040
This is clearly wrong! This is sacrilege!

34:17.120 --> 34:19.520
But I am not a Christian. So?

34:19.600 --> 34:22.960
Please, let these men rest peacefully.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.040
I knew some of them.
I fought alongside them.

34:25.840 --> 34:29.960
I may have abandoned the Lords of Mercia,
but I never abandoned simple warriors!

34:30.040 --> 34:33.199
So, you lie to yourself,
as well as everyone else!

34:33.719 --> 34:36.639
You do not get to choose
which Saxons you’ve betrayed.

34:36.719 --> 34:39.080
You’ve spat on all of them
and now you must watch us do worse.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.639
I have not spat!

34:41.360 --> 34:42.600
I was forced to.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.960
No one forced you. You begged us.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.679
And as I said, I’m not a Christian.

34:49.440 --> 34:52.440
And I'm yet to meet people
who welcome traitors.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.320
So, be glad these men are dead,

34:55.400 --> 34:57.960
so they can’t witness
what you’ve become a part of.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.280
[grunting]

35:07.360 --> 35:09.400
[Danes chatter and laugh]

35:20.720 --> 35:21.560
[guard] Go.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.800
[background chattering]

36:06.320 --> 36:07.160
[guard] Here.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.200
-I will never forgive this.
-[door slams]

36:11.280 --> 36:13.640
And I will never forgive the king.
If he had not abandoned--

36:13.720 --> 36:16.520
[Aelswith] Cnut and Sigtryggr
would have joined and the threat we face

36:16.600 --> 36:18.800
would be double. Do you think that...

36:23.480 --> 36:24.320
Hello.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.560
Tell me, you’re far too young

36:28.640 --> 36:31.360
and too noble looking
to be a servant to her,

36:31.440 --> 36:35.000
so, why were you traveling
with the Lady Aelswith?

36:36.640 --> 36:39.800
I'm to be educated at Bedwyn.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.120
She must like you very much.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.720
My name is Lord Aethelhelm. What’s yours?

36:48.400 --> 36:51.040
I’ve been told not to answer that.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.000
You can tell me.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.720
The king’s my friend.

37:00.640 --> 37:01.640
Aethelstan?

37:03.800 --> 37:04.760
Is that your name?

37:05.720 --> 37:06.680
No.

37:07.480 --> 37:08.880
I think it could be.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.880
Why have you brought the King's bastard
to Wessex?

37:19.480 --> 37:22.040
Because the King has asked me to.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.600
The king would not do that.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.960
The child has no more status
than any son of a whore.

37:27.440 --> 37:30.000
Well, perhaps you do not know
his wishes as I do!

37:31.160 --> 37:33.720
If we escape this, it will be righted.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.400
But you will not escape this.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.200
So, I suggest you focus on your account
with God.

37:41.360 --> 37:45.200
And perhaps you should reflect
on your anger towards a poor child.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.760
Aethelstan, come.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.680
Look on your grandfather, King Alfred.

37:59.120 --> 38:01.840
He was as strong as this stone...

38:02.920 --> 38:06.360
but his eyes were very warm and bright.

38:07.480 --> 38:11.960
His intelligence shone through him,
as it shines through you.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.600
Danes come for us
to prise us from our God.

38:19.280 --> 38:23.760
In those times, we hold steadfast
to our Lord and do not buckle.

38:26.760 --> 38:28.760
We may not survive this...

38:29.800 --> 38:32.800
but our kingdom will
and that is all that matters.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.400
Our sense of history is who we are.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.720
It is how God separated us
from the animals.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.000
[door opens]

38:49.840 --> 38:53.240
-And I will not be treated as an animal.
-[door slams]

39:03.480 --> 39:05.600
[Finan] Have we sent Eadith to her death?

39:06.800 --> 39:08.080
I do not think so.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.320
[inhales sharply]

39:09.400 --> 39:10.320
What now, then?

39:11.360 --> 39:12.760
We have to wait for Edward.

39:12.840 --> 39:14.000
Oh, come on!

39:14.080 --> 39:16.200
Since when do we sit on our arses
waiting for royalty?

39:16.280 --> 39:20.160
Since a boy with no reputation came out
of nowhere and took the biggest prize.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.560
[sighs]

39:22.400 --> 39:25.360
Do you think I want to wait here
when my daughter’s within?

39:25.440 --> 39:28.000
If they discover who she is,
they will kill her.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.080
So, act now, Lord, before it’s too late.

39:31.560 --> 39:32.640
[Sihtric grunts]

39:34.400 --> 39:35.680
Take them on with swords?

39:35.760 --> 39:37.880
I do not yet know how to win against him.

39:38.360 --> 39:41.920
Hey, what happened to the man
who always ran into battle?

39:44.880 --> 39:47.440
I lost Beocca in my haste at Bebbanburg.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.960
Understand if I try to find
a more cautious path.

39:55.000 --> 39:55.840
Hm.

39:57.120 --> 39:58.120
I'll be quiet.

39:58.920 --> 40:00.280
I’m an arseling.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.320
We care for the people within.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.960
It puts us at a disadvantage.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.400
[indistinct chattering and laughter
in background]

40:39.120 --> 40:40.880
[whispers] I’ve been drinking ale.

40:41.880 --> 40:42.800
I know.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.640
What do you want?

40:50.720 --> 40:52.480
To kill someone, I think.

40:54.640 --> 40:56.840
Someone or myself, one of the two.

40:57.760 --> 40:59.560
Sigtryggr wants me as a hostage.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.120
I am of use to him alive.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.640
Oh, don’t be fooled.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.720
He’s playing with you.

41:05.960 --> 41:09.400
Unlike myself,
he’s a man bereft of conscience.

41:09.480 --> 41:11.600
Then don’t anger him by killing me.

41:12.160 --> 41:13.720
If you want favor amongst the Danes--

41:13.800 --> 41:15.920
I don’t want favor amongst the Danes!

41:18.840 --> 41:21.760
Making a bargain with them was madness.
I can see that now.

41:23.040 --> 41:26.040
I will suffer whatever I choose.

41:27.240 --> 41:33.320
So, I might as well take pleasure
in a small scrap of vengeance.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.160
I have done nothing to you.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.240
Your father turned my sister from me.

41:38.760 --> 41:42.000
Your father, Lady Aethelflaed,
the King, all of them,

41:42.080 --> 41:44.280
stole my chance to regain my honor.

41:44.840 --> 41:48.720
Pushed my face in the dirt when all
I wanted was to take back what was owed.

41:49.720 --> 41:52.120
Do you know what it is
to live your life derided?

41:52.600 --> 41:55.000
To be forced to turn
from your people to survive?

41:55.080 --> 41:56.880
Do you know what that does to a man?

41:57.360 --> 41:58.800
Turns him into a drunk?

42:01.840 --> 42:03.120
Do not mock me.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.600
Then don’t be pitiful.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.880
All this you brought upon yourself.
You know that.

42:07.960 --> 42:08.880
[groans]

42:10.280 --> 42:12.480
[footsteps]

42:12.560 --> 42:14.320
Is this how we play now?

42:17.200 --> 42:19.200
We strike those weaker than ourselves?

42:20.400 --> 42:21.280
[grunts]

42:24.600 --> 42:27.840
Go on. I like this game.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.160
[breathes heavily]

42:31.240 --> 42:34.680
-She’s defiant and she does not fear me.
-Is that how Saxons are controlled?

42:36.440 --> 42:37.800
I don’t understand you.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.600
In Saxon lands,
are people subdued through fear?

42:40.680 --> 42:44.120
-Are not all people subdued by fear?
-Was this how Alfred thrived?

42:44.200 --> 42:46.440
-Yes.
-No! Alfred was loved!

42:46.520 --> 42:48.120
Look at how they honor him.

42:49.360 --> 42:53.160
And what of your Lord Aethelred whom
you abandoned to choose a life with me?

42:53.640 --> 42:56.280
Aethelred was loved and feared.

42:56.360 --> 42:59.000
Not by you. You killed him in his bed.

43:00.320 --> 43:02.080
It’s why he ran from Mercia.

43:02.360 --> 43:05.000
-Is this true?
-No, why would you believe a captive girl?

43:06.240 --> 43:08.040
You lie worse than a child.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.840
So, you killed the man
whom you'd sworn allegiance to?

43:12.920 --> 43:14.880
I knew there was
something untrustworthy about you.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.880
I brought you here.
You can trust me. I’ve proved it.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.280
And how should I rule here?

43:23.560 --> 43:24.480
By fear?

43:25.560 --> 43:26.680
Or by love?

43:33.280 --> 43:34.760
I would always choose fear.

43:40.640 --> 43:44.000
-[crowd yelling]
-[Eardwulf grunts] Sigtryggr, please! No.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.120
Sigtryggr.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.280
-[pants]
-[crowd shouting]

43:50.640 --> 43:53.280
Arse-licker, did you fall in the shit?

43:53.840 --> 43:56.200
-[pants]
-[Dane] They cut off your tongue.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.080
[Eardwulf groans]

43:58.200 --> 44:00.560
-What did he do?
-He works to his own plan.

44:00.640 --> 44:03.480
We need to be of one mind
when the time comes.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.160
He’s playing with you.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.200
The man is cold,
but he will make a show of mercy.

44:13.120 --> 44:14.840
I’ve come to know him.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.480
[Eardwulf pants]

44:16.560 --> 44:20.240
We take this place
because we seek a homeland!

44:21.400 --> 44:24.360
We work as one to achieve
this common good!

44:25.240 --> 44:26.440
When we fight...

44:27.320 --> 44:31.280
we fight with one heart
to terrify the Saxons!

44:31.360 --> 44:35.600
But we do not succumb to anger.

44:37.000 --> 44:42.560
And at all times we are united,
unlike our forebears...

44:44.040 --> 44:47.080
the men who tried and failed.

44:47.560 --> 44:51.640
Ubba, Bloodhair, Cnut...

44:52.400 --> 44:58.600
all taken in anger,
as they tried to pursue their own glory.

44:59.800 --> 45:03.120
This is the way of the <i>old </i>generation.

45:03.680 --> 45:06.240
And there is no longer a place for it.

45:13.280 --> 45:14.280
This man...

45:15.680 --> 45:16.680
This man...

45:20.800 --> 45:23.800
is a man of ambition.

45:24.440 --> 45:26.040
There’s nothing wrong with that.

45:26.960 --> 45:28.560
We should all have ambition.

45:29.760 --> 45:33.560
But he works only for himself
and his own desires.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.200
And this ambition...

45:39.160 --> 45:40.480
is a poison...

45:41.280 --> 45:43.920
a poison that has the power to seep!

45:44.000 --> 45:45.480
And we must not

45:45.560 --> 45:49.360
-let his<i> venom </i>spread amongst us.
-[Dane] Yes.

45:49.640 --> 45:53.080
So, let this man's fate
serve as a warning,

45:53.160 --> 45:57.080
for the danger of anger and ambition.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.160
No. [breathes heavily]

46:01.240 --> 46:03.040
No, no, no, please, please, please.

46:03.520 --> 46:04.840
I can't die, please.

46:05.400 --> 46:06.520
[breathes heavily]

46:06.600 --> 46:09.040
Please spare this repentant sinner, God.
Please!

46:09.120 --> 46:11.400
Forgive me for I... [breathes heavily]

46:11.480 --> 46:14.600
Forgive my sins, so that my soul
can be saved, Lord God.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.120
[mutters incoherently]

46:17.200 --> 46:18.400
[Eadith] Have mercy!

46:21.960 --> 46:23.280
Who weeps for you?

46:23.760 --> 46:25.240
Who has this faith?

46:26.920 --> 46:28.280
She’s a whore I once knew.

46:34.360 --> 46:37.000
She is nothing. Discard her.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.440
[whimpers softly]

46:47.080 --> 46:50.640
You dare speak against the greatest
warriors who ever walked this land?

46:54.480 --> 46:57.040
-Huh?
-If they were the greatest...

46:58.080 --> 46:59.440
then where are they now?

47:06.800 --> 47:08.280
[Eardwulf mutters in despair]

47:11.040 --> 47:12.800
[grunts]

47:16.240 --> 47:18.800
[groans and gasps]

47:21.120 --> 47:22.720
-[slash of sword]
-[groans]

47:33.400 --> 47:35.600
[sobs]

47:37.520 --> 47:38.920
[indistinct chattering]

47:53.920 --> 47:55.240
-Psst!
-[gasps]

47:55.880 --> 47:56.840
[breathes heavily]

47:57.720 --> 47:58.720
What are you doing?

48:00.680 --> 48:03.040
I was asked to bring food to the captives.

48:03.120 --> 48:05.120
You are almost convincing.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.480
I think...

48:09.200 --> 48:10.040
[inhales]

48:11.040 --> 48:12.600
...you could be his sister.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.320
Eardwulf was not a man of lust

48:15.400 --> 48:17.760
and he spoke of no one
else who cared for him.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
Are you not the woman
who humped Aethelred for silver?

48:22.640 --> 48:24.440
I do not know who you speak of.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.720
-Come.
-[gasps] Where are you taking me?

48:29.800 --> 48:31.360
Somewhere Sigtryggr won’t find you.

48:32.880 --> 48:35.240
You do not want to suffer
your brother’s fate.

48:36.320 --> 48:37.600
[whimpers and pants]

48:49.240 --> 48:51.320
[Finan] Is that our chance to get in?

48:52.920 --> 48:55.680
[Uhtred] Perhaps,
if they have more dead to bring out.

48:56.640 --> 48:58.840
[rumble of horses' hooves]

49:02.720 --> 49:04.640
Finan, move!

49:04.720 --> 49:07.640
[yelling]

49:12.440 --> 49:14.280
[Dane] Send word to Sigtryggr!

49:14.360 --> 49:17.360
[roaring and yelling]

49:19.160 --> 49:23.960
[Edward] Charge down those gates!
Show them the face of death!

49:28.560 --> 49:29.840
[Finan groans in despair]

49:34.560 --> 49:36.400
[yelling]

49:37.520 --> 49:39.480
[Edward] Show them no fear!

49:39.560 --> 49:41.080
It makes no sense.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.240
[Edward] Dismount!

49:42.920 --> 49:44.720
Archers ready!

49:47.800 --> 49:50.440
Let’s take back what is rightfully ours!

49:52.320 --> 49:54.880
-That way to the walls.
-[Sigtryggr] Archers.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.800
[yelling]

49:59.880 --> 50:02.240
We have to stop them, Lord,
before it gets them all killed!

50:12.400 --> 50:14.160
[Edward] Stain the ground
with their blood!

50:15.000 --> 50:17.120
[men groan in pain]

50:18.760 --> 50:20.000
[roars]

50:26.280 --> 50:27.280
Pull back!

50:29.720 --> 50:30.800
Pull back!

50:31.480 --> 50:33.920
[yelling]

50:36.800 --> 50:39.640
Stop! Hold with your king!

50:41.920 --> 50:42.880
[exhales]

50:43.520 --> 50:47.760
Men are coming from every corner
of the Saxon kingdom!

50:48.600 --> 50:52.520
By dawn tomorrow, you will be surrounded!

50:53.000 --> 50:57.840
Surrender now and avoid being massacred!

50:57.920 --> 50:58.920
[soldier] Up shield!

50:59.600 --> 51:02.240
-Build the shield wall!
-[Uhtred] Move, move, move!

51:03.720 --> 51:04.720
Lord King!

51:05.920 --> 51:09.080
Lord King! Hold back.
Sigtryggr fights another way.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.600
We need a better plan.

51:10.680 --> 51:13.240
Do you surrender?

51:16.040 --> 51:17.040
Do nothing.

51:18.320 --> 51:21.240
The walls will hold.
The fool built them strong.

51:21.960 --> 51:24.800
Listen to me! Do not do this!

51:32.240 --> 51:34.600
-Attack!
-[Uhtred] No!

51:34.680 --> 51:37.160
[men roar]
