WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.967 --> 00:12.000
(echoes)
Let this motherfucker party
begin!

00:14.467 --> 00:16.767
This time we are back
where we belong.

00:17.967 --> 00:19.067
Newcastle.

00:20.367 --> 00:22.300
With our friends.

00:22.367 --> 00:23.367
And family.

00:24.467 --> 00:26.100
Yoo-hoo!
Nana.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.733
Doing the things we love.

00:29.700 --> 00:30.700
Agh!

00:31.767 --> 00:33.633
There'll be some new faces...

00:33.700 --> 00:34.733
Hello.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.767
...plenty of old faces.

00:36.833 --> 00:38.833
Ozzie, Ozzie, Ozzie!

00:39.267 --> 00:41.633
And one big blast from the past.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.333
Long time no fuckin' see.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.800
(yelling)

00:45.867 --> 00:49.400
But don't worry...
We're still proper radge.

00:50.533 --> 00:52.267
Which means getting inebriated.

00:53.633 --> 00:55.500
You mean mortal?

00:56.367 --> 00:57.400
(retches)

00:57.467 --> 00:59.600
Lots of fornication.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.667
Shagging, you divvy.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.500
And lots and lots of mayhem.

01:07.433 --> 01:09.867
Agh!
(all scream)

01:10.633 --> 01:12.500
Fuck off!

01:22.633 --> 01:24.167
It's gonna be better.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.100
Aye, fuckin' hell.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.600
Me and Chlo have separated
from the rest of the gang

01:33.667 --> 01:36.267
cos Sophie punched me
and Nathan kicked off at Chloe.

01:37.633 --> 01:40.167
When her and Sam are fine,
she's nowhere to be seen.

01:41.533 --> 01:43.333
It's upset us
I might've hurt Nathan.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.933
It's hard to appease my best
friend
and my boyfriend.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.700
I am sorry
for raising my hand at ya.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.833
Thank God Sophie and Sam
have sorted it out.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.900
I can enjoy the rest of my
holiday.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.200
I need to go for a poo.

01:55.267 --> 01:58.367
I wouldn't mind being here with
a
hunk just for a bit of fun.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.433
I know I had Alex in Australia.

02:02.067 --> 02:05.100
Alex was a holiday romance,
which is
just what Sophie needed.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.333
Hello. Is that my Holly dolly?

02:08.400 --> 02:10.100
I'm gonna give Holly a cheeky
call.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.700
I just need my girl back.

02:11.767 --> 02:12.767
Hiya.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.867
I'll show you young
whippersnappers
how to party in Beni.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.100
Right now the family is
in a good place

02:19.167 --> 02:21.100
and life couldn't get any
better.

02:21.167 --> 02:23.100
(all cheer)

02:24.600 --> 02:26.367
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:26.433 --> 02:28.367
I'm preened to perfection.

02:28.433 --> 02:31.200
I'm tanned, toned, and ready.

02:31.267 --> 02:34.233
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.033
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.033
I'm happy-go-lucky, a bit of
a Jack the lad. That's me to a
T.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.800
I'm fit, I'm flirty,
and I've got double Fs.

02:42.867 --> 02:45.367
What you see is what you get.
Bags of fun.

02:45.433 --> 02:49.033
I can't believe anyone would put
me
in charge of this lot.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.500
Right, come on then, kids. Come
on.
Abbie!

03:02.300 --> 03:04.100
Ooh, fuck.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.967
I'm still fuckin' pissed.

03:06.033 --> 03:07.600
We've had such a good time here,

03:07.667 --> 03:10.433
but we need to get out of this
villa
and get to the airport

03:10.500 --> 03:11.833
before we miss the flight.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.133
Hey.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.300
Anna told us to look after the
villa,
which sounds like an easy job,

03:18.367 --> 03:20.267
but judging by the look of this,

03:20.333 --> 03:23.133
let's get back home
before we get bollocked.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.700
This is what you get when you're
being a gentleman.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.633
I can't do it. Nathan?

03:27.700 --> 03:30.833
I could definitely get used to
being
a jet setter.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.400
And I even pulled,
but it's time to head home.

03:34.833 --> 03:37.767
Goodbye, Benidorm, hello the
Toon!

03:44.467 --> 03:46.467
Home, sweet home, you fuckers!

03:47.600 --> 03:49.400
Oh, it's actually clean.

03:49.467 --> 03:52.900
We've got back to the house, and
Anna has managed to clean the
place.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.467
I actually think I love her.

03:54.533 --> 03:56.533
Morning.
Mummy and Daddy are back home.

03:58.267 --> 04:02.033
Benidorm was amazing, but d'you
know
what? There's no place like
home.

04:02.100 --> 04:05.733
If I'm honest with you, Benidorm
has
left me like a half-licked
lolly.

04:08.800 --> 04:12.333
Whaddya think was better,
Benidorm
or Blackpool? Benidorm.
Benidorm.

04:13.233 --> 04:14.867
(brakes squeal)

04:14.933 --> 04:16.399
Is that a car?

04:16.466 --> 04:18.466
Who the fuck could that be?

04:19.399 --> 04:22.633
Hey, Newcastle. So I were here
in the UK visiting my family,

04:22.700 --> 04:25.833
but I thought it'd be rude if I
didn't visit my party family.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.800
Ozzie, Ozzie, Ozzie!
(whooping)

04:28.867 --> 04:31.900
Oh, my God, it's Alex from
Australia.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.200
Sophie's gonna freak out
when she sees him.

04:34.267 --> 04:36.033
(all cheer)

04:36.100 --> 04:39.567
We needed another lad in the
house,
and who better to have than
Alex.

04:39.633 --> 04:40.833
I'm actually buzzing.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.833
What are you doing in England?!

04:43.900 --> 04:45.133
Who the fuck's that?

04:47.067 --> 04:49.067
You're going to die.

04:51.567 --> 04:55.733
Oh, my God, it's Alex, my
holiday
romance from Australia.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.467
My heart is actually
racing right now.

04:58.533 --> 05:00.433
Remember me?

05:00.500 --> 05:01.800
How are you?

05:01.867 --> 05:05.867
God, Sophie looks fine. I'm so
glad
I've been working on the gun
show.

05:06.867 --> 05:10.333
What are you doing here?
I've come to show you how to
party.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.033
Going out with the Geordies in
Australia was amazing,

05:13.100 --> 05:15.533
but going out on the Toon with
them
in Newcastle,

05:15.600 --> 05:16.967
I think it's gonna be epic.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.533
So this is our room.
Good to see ya.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.400
It's a lot tidier.

05:23.467 --> 05:27.133
We need to decide which side I'm
gonna be on. So that's your bed.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.733
Sharing a bed with Nathan?
Besties back together.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.833
I'm buzzing you came.
I'm excited.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.367
I'm not.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

05:37.433 --> 05:39.500
I'm not excited
I've got to share a bed.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.333
I'm shaking.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.233
In Australia, Alex made us the
happiest I've been in a long
time.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.500
But now that he's here in
Newcastle,
it's like shit.

05:52.567 --> 05:54.867
I don't know how I should be
feeling,

05:54.933 --> 05:57.700
it's just a massive shock
to have him here.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.233
I can't believe it.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.733
He just knows
we've got unfinished business.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.267
That's why he's come back.
Do you reckon?

06:04.333 --> 06:07.200
He's got muscles. Ah!

06:08.067 --> 06:10.100
I'm speechless for once in my
life.

06:10.167 --> 06:13.733
I've never seen you like this.
I'm having an anxiety attack.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.433
I have never in my life seen
Sophie
like this.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.767
Ah, fuck.
I've got anxiety for ya.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.233
I feel all weird.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.467
Alex, how do you feel
about your new room?

06:23.533 --> 06:26.600
I've got Nathan, so I'm gonna
get
a good spoon at night.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.200
Things haven't changed between
me
and Alex.

06:29.267 --> 06:31.367
I just hope
Sophie doesn't get jealous.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.667
What are you doing in Newcastle?
Seeing family,

06:34.733 --> 06:36.833
but I thought,
why not see the family again?

06:36.900 --> 06:39.167
Alex, you missed me, don't you
lie.
I did.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.267
I knew it.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.700
So you haven't seen Newcastle.

06:43.767 --> 06:46.967
And if you wanna see Newcastle,
I'm your girl.

06:47.033 --> 06:50.433
If anybody is gonna show him
around
town, it's gonna be me.

06:50.500 --> 06:55.033
Me and you are gonna go and see
some stuff of Geordieland.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.567
Sophie's saying she's gonna show
me
around Newcastle.

06:58.633 --> 07:01.433
I cannot wait to see
Sophie's good spots.

07:02.133 --> 07:05.233
Is that a date? It's not.
Of course it's a date.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.933
It's definitely not a date.
It is.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.400
If that is not a date,
I don't know what the fuck is.

07:09.467 --> 07:12.500
Shall we get ready then?
Let's go.

07:20.433 --> 07:21.800
Alex.

07:22.767 --> 07:23.867
See ya.

07:23.933 --> 07:26.833
In Australia, they pretended
they
didn't like each other,

07:26.900 --> 07:30.367
but they did. Lots of games were
played until they finally got it
on.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.867
Excited?
Yeah, I'm buzzing.

07:31.933 --> 07:35.400
I've just arrived and I've
already
got one-on-one time with Sophie.

07:35.467 --> 07:37.233
We had a great time
on the Gold Coast,

07:37.300 --> 07:40.300
but just maybe we might be able
to
pick it up where we left off.

07:45.567 --> 07:47.633
Yoga's waiting for us. Come on.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.267
While Sophie and Alex are off on
their mate date,

07:50.333 --> 07:53.567
we need to heal ourselves
cos we went so hard in Benidorm.

07:53.633 --> 07:55.200
So we are off to Yoga.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.367
Hommmm...

07:57.000 --> 07:58.667
Get out.

08:00.333 --> 08:03.300
Who's a motherfuckin' bum?
Piss off. Piss off!

08:04.933 --> 08:06.967
Get out! Go on, get out!

08:07.033 --> 08:09.033
(all shout)

08:13.167 --> 08:15.167
I'm a fuckin' boss bitch!

08:15.900 --> 08:18.133
(both laugh)

08:18.200 --> 08:20.267
I'm a boss bitch. I'm a boss
bitch.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.000
Bitch!

08:22.067 --> 08:24.833
(laughs) Fuckin' hell.
What are we gonna do now?

08:24.900 --> 08:27.233
I'm a boss bitch.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.067
Come on, guys, yoga time!

08:36.832 --> 08:40.232
I will squeeze your bottom.
Ooh, look. Look. Incense.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.333
This is like hippy stuff.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.367
Go on, Abbie.

08:46.967 --> 08:51.167
I thought we were just doing
yoga.
What is it with the sex rings?

08:51.233 --> 08:52.633
Making me kinky.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.733
Ooh, are you all right, hun?

08:56.167 --> 08:58.167
What the fuck is that woman
doing?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.967
I've got a boyfriend, so I wanna
learn some good positions. Yeah.

09:03.033 --> 09:04.033
Jump.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.867
What's this called?
Downward triangle!

09:08.933 --> 09:11.867
The blood's going to my head.
Fuck a duck.

09:11.933 --> 09:15.267
Faith and Abbie look like they
have
a broom stuck up their arse.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.333
The girls are so rigid.

09:17.867 --> 09:20.400
Ah, ah. I can feel the filler
going
up my face.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.300
(laughing)

09:23.367 --> 09:24.700
Ooh, this is so scary.

09:24.767 --> 09:26.867
I don't know how I feel
about that one.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.500
Pull, pull,
like you're pushing a poo out.

09:29.567 --> 09:31.700
Do you wanna let go of your
hands?
Do I fuck!

09:31.767 --> 09:33.767
(squealing)

09:36.300 --> 09:39.233
I've got no idea what I'm doing,
but this is such a laugh.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.267
Do you think Alex
still likes Sophie?

09:41.333 --> 09:43.367
I think it's gonna go
one of two ways.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.400
It could be back how it was
in Australia,

09:45.467 --> 09:48.200
they both pretend they don't
like
each other and they do,

09:48.267 --> 09:51.300
or Sophie will take him on the
pull,
he'll get with a Geordie girl

09:51.367 --> 09:54.733
and she'll be fine with it,
or Sophie kicking off.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.433
And going fuckin' mad.
Yeah. What could possibly...

09:59.900 --> 10:02.000
...go wrong?

10:02.067 --> 10:04.800
Yoga in the air, on the swing,
has been really good.

10:04.867 --> 10:08.100
But I wanna get back cos I
cannot
wait to find out what happened

10:08.167 --> 10:09.500
on Sophie and Alex's date.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.400
How do I get out? Agh!

10:11.467 --> 10:14.600
By climbing forward. Why are you
going backwards? I'm stuck.

10:21.167 --> 10:24.967
I've decided to take Alex on
a tandem bike ride of Newcastle.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.200
(both laugh)

10:28.800 --> 10:29.900
Whoo!

10:29.967 --> 10:32.367
I can tell he's enjoying the
ride.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.900
Are you liking it then?
It's actually all right.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.933
Whoa, look at that building
to the left.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.500
That's called the Baltic.
What happens in there?

10:39.567 --> 10:42.700
Also in Geordie, if you say
you're
Baltic, it means you're cold.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.967
So you go,
"Fuckin' hell, I'm Baltic."

10:45.033 --> 10:48.033
Where do we wanna pull up?
We'll just stop here. Stop here?

10:48.100 --> 10:52.867
Newcastle is stunning, but
nothing
compared to Sophie. She is
amazing.

10:53.433 --> 10:55.633
I still can't get over
you're in Newcastle.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.833
It's still sinking in. It's a
shock,
but I'm glad you're here.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.933
I'm glad I'm here because we did
have a connection in Australia,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.333
but let's just have fun.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.467
I don't want you to think you've
gotta spend all the time with
me.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.333
You're only in Newcastle once.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.033
I don't know if he's came back
just
for me or just for the fun.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.633
As much as I don't want to,

11:13.700 --> 11:16.533
I'm giving him the option to go
out
on the pull.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.667
So I'm not opening myself up
to get hurt.

11:18.733 --> 11:21.467
So when a woman says,
"do what you wanna do..."

11:22.500 --> 11:25.167
I'm saying that, I'm saying
that.
Yeah, right, OK.

11:25.233 --> 11:28.600
You know what? When I've had a
drink
other things happen. I know
that.

11:28.667 --> 11:32.000
If there's one thing I've learnt
in
Oz, Sophie says one thing

11:32.067 --> 11:34.433
but she means another,
just like most women.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.733
With you being here, it'll bring
excitement, everyone'll be
buzzing.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.867
I really hope
it lives up to the standards.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.800
If it's terrible,
I'm throwing you over this.

11:43.867 --> 11:46.733
Looking at Alex now,
he looks so good.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.600
Better hair, better muscles,

11:48.667 --> 11:50.167
and better dress sense.

11:50.233 --> 11:53.033
Tonight I'm gonna find it
hard to resist him.

11:53.100 --> 11:56.033
So come on then, let's get back
home. I'll show you the ropes.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.667
What about this? Oh, fuck that.
Let's get a taxi. Oh, thank God.

12:00.333 --> 12:03.833
It's only fair we show Alex
how hard us Geordies go.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.667
Calm down? Sophie is right
there.

12:08.733 --> 12:10.200
Oh, my God.

12:10.267 --> 12:12.633
What the fuck is Chloe doing?

12:12.700 --> 12:13.967
Chloe, no!

12:36.667 --> 12:40.333
I cannot believe that Alex is
here
all the way from Australia.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.467
And we're about to take him on
his
first night out in the Toon.

12:43.533 --> 12:46.567
I'm not gonna lie,
but I am a little bit excited.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.200
Was Alex flirting then?

12:48.267 --> 12:52.300
Um, he wasn't flirting. There
was no
flirting but there was just

12:52.367 --> 12:56.233
a catch-up. Like a very good
mate date catch-up.

12:56.300 --> 12:58.233
Don't you want to shag him
again?

12:58.300 --> 13:01.667
I think the last thing on my
mind is
shagging straightaway. Right.

13:01.733 --> 13:04.500
I think Sophie is definitely
trying
to play it cool,

13:04.567 --> 13:07.600
cos she was a giggling mess when
Alex walked through the door.

13:07.667 --> 13:11.500
I'm not in a relationship with
him.
He was just a shag in Australia.

13:11.567 --> 13:14.433
Come on, Sophie,
we know that Alex wasn't just a
shag.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.200
There was feelings involved.

13:16.267 --> 13:18.833
I'm so glad he hasn't got that
same
haircut anymore.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.867
I would've been embarrassed to
go
out here with him like that.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.433
If you were to go out and pull,
what would Sophie be saying
after

13:26.500 --> 13:30.400
you went out today with her?
Maybe if
she gets a couple of drinks in
her

13:30.467 --> 13:33.367
maybe she'll be bothered,
but to be honest I have no clue.

13:33.433 --> 13:36.467
Why can't you get together
cos we all know you like each
other?

13:36.533 --> 13:38.800
I'm going to take it upon myself
to make sure

13:38.867 --> 13:41.567
you're the drunkest man in that
club.
Please, please.

13:41.633 --> 13:44.833
There's no way Alex is coming on
a night out when he's that
white.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.933
He needs a fuckin' tan.
He's like an X-ray.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.067
It's just an initial start.
Close your eyes.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.500
Rub it in, Sam.
Rub it in well.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.567
Enjoying that, are you?
Let's have a look.

13:55.633 --> 13:58.033
It's all right, that.
Have a look.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.633
See what you think.
I'm dreading this.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.333
It's not that bad.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.400
I'm all up for cultural
exchanges,
but this is a bit much.

14:06.633 --> 14:10.567
See? It's not that bad, is it?
Let's go for a drink. Come on,
lads.

14:10.633 --> 14:13.867
Someone said double chin and
tonic.
(laughs)

14:14.167 --> 14:16.667
You've got a double chin,
you fat shit. You can talk.

14:16.733 --> 14:20.500
It's only fair, as hosts,
we show him how hard us Geordies
go.

14:20.567 --> 14:23.767
He might have been drunk before
but he's never been mortal.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.367
Girls, come on down!

14:28.933 --> 14:32.033
Introducing first, it's Sophie!

14:32.667 --> 14:34.300
My God, Sophie looks good.

14:34.367 --> 14:35.600
(wolf-whistle)

14:35.667 --> 14:38.833
Did Alex just wolf-whistle at
Sophie? That's promising.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.033
Maybe they'll get with each
other
tonight.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.800
Please take a look at Alex for a
minute and his outfit and his
face.

14:44.867 --> 14:48.767
And his tan.
This is apparently what they
wear.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.233
Alex is looking fit.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.667
The lads have actually done a
really
good job "Geordiefying" him.

14:53.733 --> 14:56.200
Have you got fake tan on?
Yes, I do. On my face.

14:56.267 --> 14:58.233
They were trying to stitch me
up.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.800
You can tell Chloe's your bird
cos that's good.

15:01.867 --> 15:02.933
(all laugh)

15:03.000 --> 15:04.767
Sophie has lost her head over
Alex.

15:04.833 --> 15:08.100
I never knew fake tan could make
someone's face light up like
that.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.200
She looks like
Blackpool Pleasure Beach.

15:10.267 --> 15:12.267
(all cheer)

15:12.933 --> 15:14.300
Get us to the club.

15:17.733 --> 15:21.033
Let just have fuckin' fun. Yeah!
Welcome Alex to Newcastle,

15:21.100 --> 15:23.633
show him what it's all about.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.000
It wouldn't be the first night
back

15:28.067 --> 15:30.033
if we weren't going
to House of Smith.

15:30.100 --> 15:35.733
Let's get M-O-R-T-A-L! Mortal!

15:42.567 --> 15:46.600
The club is fuckin' wicked and
we've
got Alex. Tonight's gonna be
epic.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.233
(all cheer)

15:59.300 --> 16:02.767
The tunes are pumping, we're
looking
good. I can't wait to get
plastered.

16:17.033 --> 16:19.200
I am loving having Alex here.

16:19.267 --> 16:23.433
Sophie's so focused on him that
she's
forgotten about butting in on

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
mine and Chloe's business.
Happy days.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.533
Alex seems like a decent bloke,

16:34.600 --> 16:37.600
and all of us seemed happy to
see
him. Hopefully we can be mates.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.367
I must admit,
Alex is looking really fit,

16:51.433 --> 16:53.733
but I don't know where his
head's at.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.800
And I don't wanna make
a tit of myself.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.599
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've heard it
all
before in Australia.

17:18.666 --> 17:21.433
Just stop worrying, chill out
and have a good night.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.433
Alex is really smashing the
drinks
tonight.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.133
Let's hope he doesn't forget
Sophie
in the process.

17:52.667 --> 17:55.700
I'm proper fucked, and the
drink's
way stronger in Newcastle.

17:55.767 --> 17:58.433
You know what? This is the
perfect
time to hit on Sophie.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.433
Alex is trying it on with us
but he's completely fucked.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.300
This is not how I wanted it
to happen.

18:18.833 --> 18:22.200
I can't believe I've just been
pied.
She's done this in Australia,

18:22.267 --> 18:23.933
now she's doing it in the UK.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.767
Fuck this. I'm come here to have
a
good time. Someone get me a
drink.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.333
Who's pieing who now, Sophie?

18:57.400 --> 18:58.967
It's hard to look at Abbie's
face

18:59.033 --> 19:00.900
when her knockers are
right in my face.

19:03.067 --> 19:08.100
Alex is basically touching my
boobs.
Calm down. Sophie is right
there.

19:12.467 --> 19:15.033
I am pure bladdered, but I don't
know if I can see Alex

19:15.767 --> 19:18.767
flirting with Abbie.
That is bang out of order.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.333
This is definitely getting
awkward.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.633
Having to tell your best mate
that
her lad thinks that you're fit

19:54.700 --> 19:57.000
is one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

20:02.867 --> 20:05.133
I'm gonna give Alex
the benefit of the doubt

20:05.200 --> 20:07.833
and just put it down to
having too many Jagerbombs.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.367
I hope so anyways.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.967
I know that Alex is mortal,
but telling Abbie she's fit

20:15.033 --> 20:17.900
right in front of Sophie,
this isn't gonna end well.

20:33.033 --> 20:36.567
Alex can barely stand, and for
that
matter neither can Chloe.

20:36.633 --> 20:38.867
Let's get them home
cos I'm embarrassed.

20:43.767 --> 20:44.833
Get out.

20:46.733 --> 20:48.433
With getting back from the club,

20:48.500 --> 20:51.100
it's fair to say we've
showed Alex a cracking night.

20:52.633 --> 20:54.633
(all cheer)

21:01.167 --> 21:03.167
Get off! Get off it!

21:07.933 --> 21:09.600
What the fuck?

21:09.667 --> 21:12.300
I am so mortal I can't get these
chips and nuggets

21:12.367 --> 21:13.733
in my mouth quick enough.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.867
I've got no meat.
Give us a couple of chips.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.100
Fuckin' hell. Chloe is mortal.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.833
Oh, my God.

21:23.900 --> 21:27.833
No, Chloe! Oh, for God's sake.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.467
What the fuck is Chloe doing?

21:30.533 --> 21:32.033
Chloe, no!

21:32.100 --> 21:34.867
Oh, my God, she just pooed.
Chloe's just had a poo!

21:34.933 --> 21:36.200
Is Chloe joking?

21:36.267 --> 21:40.100
She just popped out a chocolate
Malteser on the floor. Tramp.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.667
I'm desperate. I'm desperate.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.800
Have a poo!

21:47.867 --> 21:49.533
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:49.600 --> 21:53.433
let me introduce to you my
wonderful
girlfriend, Chloe Feral.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.333
Ferry. I think it's time
you went to bed.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.700
There's no denying that Abbie
is fit as fuck,

22:12.767 --> 22:16.500
but hearing that Alex said it
is a kick in the fuckin' teeth.

22:16.567 --> 22:19.000
I'm just hoping
it was because he was mortal.

22:19.067 --> 22:22.033
I think the best thing for me
right
now is to go to sleep.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.667
(all cheer)
How are you?

22:29.733 --> 22:31.967
Holly is finally back.

22:32.033 --> 22:34.867
We are doing Newcastle Pride.
(all cheer)

22:37.467 --> 22:39.467
This is the best day ever.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.033
I was fuckin' mortal last night,
I tell you that.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.067
We know you were.
You shit yourself.

23:07.133 --> 23:10.600
There's literally a piece of poo
on the floor. No, I didn't!

23:10.667 --> 23:11.867
You did.
(laughs)

23:11.933 --> 23:15.200
I can't believe last night I
shat
myself in front of everyone.

23:15.267 --> 23:18.333
I don't even fart in front of
Sam.
Who have I become?

23:18.400 --> 23:21.900
I can talk about this all day,
I can't be arsed. I need a
coffee,

23:22.000 --> 23:23.500
sort myself out.
Fuck-offee.

23:23.567 --> 23:25.433
Anyone get it?
(laughs)

23:25.500 --> 23:26.800
I'm gonna see the girls.

23:26.867 --> 23:29.500
I'm also gonna avoid your poo
in the kitchen. Oh!

23:29.567 --> 23:32.467
I can't believe I go out with a
girl
that isn't potty-trained.

23:32.533 --> 23:34.233
Oof, I smell you from here.

23:36.933 --> 23:40.433
Let me get in with the bestie.
Oh, but listen, are you clean?

23:40.500 --> 23:45.733
What do you mean? Don't dare say
it.
Don't dare say.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.833
What happened last night, guys?
You're a bunch of animals.

23:48.900 --> 23:52.033
We should all just leave it.
How was your first night, Alex?

23:52.100 --> 23:55.400
Last night was a blur. I vaguely
remember hitting on Abbie.

23:55.467 --> 23:58.333
It started with a bang.
That was a good, warm welcoming.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.233
Last night he overstepped the
mark,

24:00.300 --> 24:02.833
and I'm just hoping it was
because
he was mortal.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.900
Right, I'm gonna make some
coffee.
I'm hanging. I'll have one.

24:13.167 --> 24:14.467
(grunts)

24:14.533 --> 24:17.367
I'm back! And, I mean,
better late than never.

24:17.433 --> 24:20.333
This whole part-time thing
suits me perfectly.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.000
I don't have to graft my arse
off

24:22.067 --> 24:24.933
and I get to spend time with my
favourite people. Win-win.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.667
(all cheer)

24:32.067 --> 24:35.100
How are you?
Better late than never.

24:35.167 --> 24:36.733
Holly is finally back.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.467
I've been waiting for her to
come
since day one.

24:39.533 --> 24:44.033
It's about fuckin' time
you turned up. Hi, gorgeous.

24:44.100 --> 24:45.500
Hi.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.700
My bitch is back in the house.

24:47.767 --> 24:50.600
Are you all right?
Pleased to meet you.

24:50.667 --> 24:53.033
This is the Holly
everyone's been talking about,

24:53.100 --> 24:55.600
and I can't wait to properly get
to
know her as well.

24:56.167 --> 25:01.167
So, guys, Anna sent us,
and we are doing Geordie Tours
today

25:01.233 --> 25:03.733
at Newcastle Pride.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
(all cheer)

25:05.867 --> 25:09.633
This is the best day ever. Talk
about somewhere over the
rainbow.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.533
Dreams really do come true.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.567
What are you doing here?
(all laugh)

25:14.633 --> 25:16.533
I decided I'd pop in.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.967
What on earth is Alex from
Australia
doing here?

25:19.033 --> 25:21.967
Has he flew all this way
just to see Sophie?

25:22.033 --> 25:25.033
Fabulous. Shall we get ready
then?
(all) Yes!

25:25.100 --> 25:28.433
I've never been to Gay Pride
before,
but I bet Nathan is so excited.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.200
I cannot wait to see all the
gays
and all the lesbians.

25:37.533 --> 25:40.400
How was it when you first came
in?
Was everyone welcoming?

25:40.467 --> 25:43.400
Everyone was so welcoming, it
was
great, when I first came in,

25:43.467 --> 25:46.867
the first few days, but then I
think... And then they go bad.

25:46.933 --> 25:50.267
I know where Faith's coming
from.
I've been in that position
myself.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.100
I'm the best person to give
advice.

25:52.167 --> 25:55.500
When I first came in,
everyone hated me, so...

25:55.567 --> 25:56.900
Why?

25:56.967 --> 25:59.233
Er... Why?
Weird. Weird.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.267
It's great having
Holly in the house.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.833
We're going to get on.

26:02.900 --> 26:06.667
How's it going with you and Sam
now
you've moved in? Really good.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.700
It's been difficult cos Sophie
and that have been arguing,

26:09.767 --> 26:13.600
it put me in an awkward
position,
but now everything's fine, it's
good.

26:13.667 --> 26:14.700
Yeah.

26:14.767 --> 26:17.367
It is so good to hear that Chloe
and Sam are going well.

26:17.433 --> 26:20.433
Having been in a relationship in
here, I know how hard it can be.

26:20.500 --> 26:23.433
Anna told me that we had
to go and work at Gay Pride,

26:23.500 --> 26:25.433
but I feel like we should have
fun.
Yeah.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.500
Just get mortal
and see what happens.

26:32.533 --> 26:35.900
I'm pinching these socks.
You're looking well. Do you like
it?

26:35.967 --> 26:38.300
What do you wear
for Newcastle Pride?

26:38.367 --> 26:40.633
Who cares?
I've got a cracking pair of
shorts.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.133
Yes, Sam.

26:50.167 --> 26:52.233
This is my first ever Gay Pride.

26:52.300 --> 26:56.100
It's great to have Holly back,
and
she has nailed it with the
outfits.

27:00.167 --> 27:02.967
I know Pride is about
celebrating
everyone,

27:03.033 --> 27:05.933
but let's be honest. I'm the
only
gay person in this house

27:06.000 --> 27:08.533
so today is about me.
Anna can fuck off.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.400
I'm really happy to go to Pride.

27:10.467 --> 27:12.033
Nathan, the unicorn's horn is

27:12.100 --> 27:14.467
meant to be on your head,
not down your pants.

27:14.533 --> 27:17.200
Is that your actual real penis?
Stop staring at it then.

27:17.267 --> 27:18.833
He's got a hard on.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.000
God, it's good to be back.

27:21.067 --> 27:24.433
Everybody looks fabulous.
Now let's get our arses to
Pride.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.600
(all cheer)

27:32.667 --> 27:34.500
Newcastle Pride.
(clicks fingers)

27:34.567 --> 27:36.967
Newcastle Pride, ah! Ah-ah!

27:37.033 --> 27:38.300
(all cheer)

27:38.367 --> 27:40.633
Oh, there's the Queen.
Where?

27:40.700 --> 27:42.633
It's not the fuckin' real Queen.

27:42.700 --> 27:47.067
Today is a celebration of love.
Being able to love whoever you
want

27:47.133 --> 27:49.400
and being able to be
whoever you want.

27:49.467 --> 27:52.433
And Nathan is in the centre of
it.
I'm fuckin' buzzing.

27:54.900 --> 27:58.233
I love it.
What do we do? What happens,
then?

27:58.300 --> 28:00.200
There is a lot of love in the
air.

28:00.267 --> 28:02.533
And right now I wouldn't wanna
be anywhere else

28:02.600 --> 28:04.033
than at Newcastle Gay Pride.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.100
(blows whistle)

28:09.500 --> 28:11.933
Walking on stilts.
I'd have fallen.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.300
Everywhere you look there's
something
going on. It's brilliant.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.367
(whistles blow)

28:30.667 --> 28:31.667
(blows whistle)

28:39.167 --> 28:41.800
I've been back longer than an
hour,
so I need to find out

28:41.867 --> 28:43.833
what's going on
between Sophie and Alex.

28:56.200 --> 29:00.033
I don't know whether to go with
my
head, who says just go for it,

29:00.100 --> 29:04.233
or go with my heart, who says
he's
gonna go back to Australia.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.800
Holly's right.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.267
I think I'm gonna put he fancies
Abbie down to the drink

29:25.333 --> 29:26.800
and see how things go.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.100
Have a drink.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.600
At the end of the day, I just
think
why not just have a shag?

30:03.667 --> 30:04.800
You only live once.

30:19.700 --> 30:22.467
I am fuckin' lovin' this.
I'm like this king of Pride.

30:22.533 --> 30:24.433
I might start coming here more
often.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.400
I've done so many new things
recently.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.667
I really am living my best life
in this house.

30:53.267 --> 30:56.300
I knew Alex was flirting with
Abbie,
but called her fit as fuck?

30:56.367 --> 30:57.533
That's out of order.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.867
If Alex knows what's good for
him,

31:07.933 --> 31:10.300
he better not try it on again
with
me tonight,

31:10.367 --> 31:12.667
cos I would never get
with my best friend's lad.

31:30.233 --> 31:32.200
(chanting) Nathan! Nathan!

31:35.900 --> 31:39.100
Gay Pride has been unreal,
so I think it's time to get
back,

31:39.167 --> 31:40.900
whack on another layer of fake
tan

31:40.967 --> 31:43.533
and get ready
and enjoy Holly's first night
back.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.300
I'm a happy gay. You're not
gonna
share a bed with me.

31:46.367 --> 31:48.000
Why not?
You'll try and touch us.

31:48.067 --> 31:49.400
You can if you want.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.400
Holly's here, and tonight is
gonna
be unreal.

31:54.267 --> 31:57.900
I wanna remind Alex of the
Sophie
that was in the Gold Coast.

32:00.767 --> 32:03.467
His hair's fuckin' shit
and he needs to learn a lesson.

32:22.867 --> 32:26.567
Do you know what, Holly? Yeah.
It is so good to have you back.

32:26.633 --> 32:27.633
Is it?

32:27.700 --> 32:31.367
Today, Pride was amazing.
So if that's anything to go by,

32:31.433 --> 32:33.200
tonight is gonna be incredible.

32:33.267 --> 32:37.033
I got my bitch back.
Oh, no, the dream team.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.600
Holly, do you contour
on top of the eyebrow?

32:44.667 --> 32:48.133
Course. You've gotta contour
your eyebrow unless you're a
freak.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.233
Not a freak.

32:50.467 --> 32:53.767
Pride was so good. Everyone
seems
much more content with Holly
here.

32:53.833 --> 32:55.300
Tonight's gonna be a good one.

32:55.367 --> 32:58.800
I'm not being funny, after Gay
Pride
I'm feeling a lot more lesbany.

32:58.867 --> 33:03.867
Shall we all be lesbians?
Let's dance on each other.

33:03.933 --> 33:07.167
It's all about the lesbians.
To the lezzers.

33:09.133 --> 33:12.467
Ah, here she is. Ah, here she
is.
(wolf-whistles)

33:12.533 --> 33:16.333
What's underneath that towel?
Wouldn't you like to know, big
boy.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.667
How have you been getting on
with
Sophie today?

33:18.733 --> 33:20.933
Do you feel like you may have a
bit
of grafting?

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
She's not gonna give it up easy,
so we're back to square one.

33:25.067 --> 33:26.700
The old hard to get game.
Yeah.

33:26.767 --> 33:29.967
I think, mate, if you just go
out
tonight, have a few drinks,

33:30.033 --> 33:33.067
get chatting to her as normal,
things will happen naturally.

33:33.133 --> 33:35.233
After last night,
Sophie's a bit off me.

33:35.300 --> 33:37.333
I'm gonna have to keep my
options opens.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.567
What about Abbie?
I'd have to see.

33:40.633 --> 33:43.500
After finding out that Alex
called Abbie "fit as fuck",

33:43.567 --> 33:45.100
I wanted to hear it for myself.

33:45.167 --> 33:48.500
Go on, answer the question.
It's like never say never.

33:48.567 --> 33:51.933
Never say never? I thought Alex
was
meant to be here for Sophie.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.667
You wouldn't go there with
Abbie.

33:53.733 --> 33:56.800
You're just saying that to the
boys.
You don't know me that well.

33:56.867 --> 33:58.067
I think I do.

33:58.133 --> 34:01.167
Come on, Alex. We all know,
deep down, you fancy Sophie.

34:01.233 --> 34:03.667
So stop giving it the big 'un
in front of the lads.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.467
Girls, come on!

34:18.533 --> 34:22.300
Today has been such a laugh, and
I'm
loving being with Holly again.

34:22.367 --> 34:24.132
I am loving life.

34:24.199 --> 34:27.567
Cheers to a good night!
(all cheer)

34:27.632 --> 34:30.467
We're in such good spirits.
Holly's here, Alex is here,

34:30.533 --> 34:32.033
and tonight is gonna be unreal.

34:46.100 --> 34:48.033
We arrive at Powerhouse.

34:48.100 --> 34:52.067
If it's half as good as Gay
Pride,
tonight is gonna be mint.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.800
Since Benidorm, I feel mine and
Chloe's friendship is back on
track.

35:10.867 --> 35:12.033
I fuckin' love this.

35:23.667 --> 35:26.833
I know what Alex said about
Abbie is
probably banter,

35:26.900 --> 35:28.667
but Sophie and Chloe are good
mates

35:28.733 --> 35:30.867
and it's probably right
for me to tell her.

35:47.267 --> 35:50.233
There's no way on God's earth
I am letting Alex mug off Sophie

35:50.300 --> 35:52.800
like he did last night.
If he doesn't watch himself,

35:52.867 --> 35:54.167
he'll have me to deal with.

36:05.267 --> 36:08.867
After speaking with Holly today,
I'm gonna let me guard down.

36:08.933 --> 36:12.433
I wanna remind Alex of the
Sophie
that was in the Gold Coast.

36:33.700 --> 36:38.267
Shit. I nearly ruined my
chances.
Play it cool, Alex. Play it
cool.

36:51.567 --> 36:54.200
All right, Alex,
enough of the cheesy chat-up
lines.

36:54.267 --> 36:56.533
Just tell us if you really like
us.

37:09.067 --> 37:11.033
(all squeal)

37:11.100 --> 37:13.700
I am finally necking on with
Alex.

37:14.167 --> 37:16.000
(sighs) This feels good.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.000
I wanna be happy for Sophie,

37:21.067 --> 37:23.433
but I can't stop
thinking about what Sam said.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.500
Alex said "never say never"
about Abbie.

37:25.567 --> 37:27.433
If Sophie knew that she'd go
mad.

37:31.667 --> 37:34.733
And he scores. This is what I
came
to Newcastle for.

37:39.333 --> 37:43.067
Alex is already swinging us
about
and hanging us upside down.

37:43.133 --> 37:45.833
The shag pad is
gonna be lit tonight.

38:11.433 --> 38:14.100
Alex, did you not learn anything
from last night?

38:14.167 --> 38:15.933
You need to lay off the drink.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.867
What is Alex doing
with Abbie on the floor?

38:22.933 --> 38:25.167
There's being drunk
and there's being a dick.

38:27.267 --> 38:31.033
Come on, Alex, this isn't
Aussie Rules. You need to sober
up.

38:33.500 --> 38:36.267
What the fuck is Alex doing
all over Abbie?

38:36.333 --> 38:39.900
I give him the benefit of the
doubt.
What the fuck is going on?

38:42.633 --> 38:44.800
Oh, shit. I was just having a
laugh.

38:44.867 --> 38:47.067
Sophie's raging
and I think I'm in trouble.

38:59.867 --> 39:02.133
What the hell does "never say
never"
mean?

39:02.200 --> 39:05.800
Does that mean he's always liked
Abbie and he's just been using
me?

39:05.867 --> 39:08.667
Does that mean he's gonna shag
Abbie? He ain't hurting me.

39:16.567 --> 39:19.867
I need to sober up. This isn't
what
the night should've been about.

39:19.933 --> 39:22.900
I should be getting with Sophie,
not falling out over Abbie.

39:26.633 --> 39:28.833
Alex is being stupid.
He's been so fucked up

39:28.900 --> 39:32.700
since he's been here, he has no
idea
how much he's hurting Sophie.

39:40.633 --> 39:42.633
Let's go!

39:44.600 --> 39:47.500
Alex, once again the Newcastle
drink
has destroyed you.

39:47.567 --> 39:49.933
Let's go
before anything else happens.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.667
I actually thought Alex
was different,

39:56.733 --> 39:58.767
but he's just another fuckin'
dickhead.

40:04.367 --> 40:05.733
Out you come.

40:05.800 --> 40:09.033
We arrive back, everyone's
mortal,
tensions are high

40:09.100 --> 40:12.833
and everyone's got kebab all
over
their face. This is just
typical.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.200
I bet this lands in Nathan's
mouth.

40:19.067 --> 40:21.667
I'm not getting any dick in my
mouth
tonight.

40:21.733 --> 40:23.967
So I'm gonna address the big
dick
in the room

40:24.033 --> 40:27.267
and give him the chance to
apologise
to Sophie in front of everyone.

40:27.333 --> 40:29.667
Let's find out what Alex thinks.

40:29.733 --> 40:34.567
I fuckin' came here to ask about
this beautiful woman right here.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.500
Like, look, at...
He cares about you.

40:37.567 --> 40:40.033
But at the end of the day,
she was playing hard to get,

40:40.100 --> 40:42.833
of course I'm gonna...
Don't speak about other girls.

40:42.900 --> 40:47.467
The last thing that I want is
Sophie
to blame me for Alex being a
dick.

40:47.533 --> 40:50.267
Tell Sophie that she is the one
that you want.

40:50.333 --> 40:52.567
Rightio.
So I came here and I was honest.

40:52.633 --> 40:55.400
And you're like,
"Oh, I'm gonna play hard to
get."

40:55.467 --> 40:58.833
I was like, "we've already been
through that in Australia."

40:58.900 --> 41:01.533
Alex, it's a little too late
for this apology.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.267
You've been at her all night!
I'm not playing games.

41:04.333 --> 41:06.933
If Abbie were single you'd go
there.
That's the truth.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.167
Alex has pissed me off tonight,
like.
His hair's fuckin' shit

41:10.233 --> 41:12.267
and he needs to learn a lesson.

41:12.333 --> 41:15.167
Alex...
No. Oh, no!

41:16.300 --> 41:18.767
Come on, Chloe,
I'm trying to apologise.

41:19.467 --> 41:21.000
Chloe, no, I'm going to bed.

41:21.067 --> 41:22.533
I hate to show my emotion,

41:22.600 --> 41:25.133
and I can feel myself about to
cry

41:25.200 --> 41:27.233
and I don't wanna do it
in front of anyone.

41:27.300 --> 41:29.300
(all laugh)

41:33.533 --> 41:37.300
Alex is a nice lad, and I was
really
rooting for him and Sophie.

41:37.367 --> 41:39.900
But he just needs to learn not
to
get as fucked up.

41:39.967 --> 41:42.933
You don't tell my friend,
you're all over her,

41:43.033 --> 41:45.367
and tell her you like someone
else.

41:45.433 --> 41:47.300
Fuck off.
You're perfect.

41:47.367 --> 41:49.967
Oi, oi! No.
Who the fuck do you think you
are?!

41:50.033 --> 41:51.900
I understand what Chloe's
saying,

41:51.967 --> 41:54.033
but we need to leave this
for tomorrow.

41:54.100 --> 41:55.233
Chloe!

41:58.933 --> 42:01.367
This is not gonna end well.

42:01.433 --> 42:02.800
I need to get Chloe to bed.

42:02.867 --> 42:05.767
Do you really think he feels
that
way? I don't think he does.

42:05.833 --> 42:07.300
Why would he say it then?!

42:12.067 --> 42:14.500
Nothing's gonna get
resolved tonight.

42:14.567 --> 42:16.800
So go to sleep,
tomorrow's a new day.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.667
It will get resolved then,
right?

42:19.800 --> 42:22.167
Not only have I fucked things up
with Sophie,

42:22.233 --> 42:24.600
but everyone in the house is
turning against me.

42:24.667 --> 42:28.333
Why the fuck do I always make
stupid mistakes?

42:32.767 --> 42:34.367
(sobs)

42:35.467 --> 42:39.133
It takes a lot for Sophie to
cry.
Sophie clearly likes Alex

42:39.200 --> 42:41.100
a lot more than she's letting
on.

42:45.700 --> 42:49.300
Since coming out of a
relationship,
I've always had my guard up.

42:49.367 --> 42:52.067
And the only person I let it
down
for was Alex.

42:52.133 --> 42:54.800
Now that he's came to Newcastle
I've let it fully down,

42:54.867 --> 42:56.833
and I'm regretting that so much.

43:04.900 --> 43:08.633
If there's anything to put me
off
shagging him, it is that.

43:10.700 --> 43:11.967
