WEBVTT

01:58.827 --> 02:01.621
-Good morrow, Lady Rhea.
-Cousin.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.623
What's today's quarry? Rabbit?

02:04.165 --> 02:07.335
-Deer.
-Fine challenge.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.837
Care for some company?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.171
I'd rather ride alone.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.800
Good fortune to you.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.098
Husband.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.606
What brings you to the Vale?

03:13.526 --> 03:17.447
Or have you at last come
to consummate our marriage?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.618
The Vale's sheep might be willing,

03:21.701 --> 03:23.036
even if I'm not.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.831
Our sheep are prettier, after all.

03:28.374 --> 03:32.045
Or perhaps your brother
has at last had his fill of your company.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.049
Cast you aside in favor of a little girl.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.806
What will you do now?

03:44.807 --> 03:47.936
Will you strike the child down?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.228
Or?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.405
I knew you couldn't finish.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.491
Craven!

05:23.489 --> 05:24.866
Thank you.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.117
A moment.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.043
I do not wish to see you go.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.464
Such is the King's decision.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.216
A decision I most bitterly regret.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.262
And yet, you made it possible.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.475
You chose Rhaenyra.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.103
She swore her innocence,

06:35.186 --> 06:37.105
and I believed her.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.774
You wanted to believe her,
as did her father.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.275
Your informant was wrong.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.320
An honest mistake, perhaps,
but I did not foresee this!

06:44.403 --> 06:45.863
You should have.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.075
If you had not been so relentless
in advancing Aegon as heir!

06:59.794 --> 07:01.712
Listen to me, daughter.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.507
The King will die.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.927
It may be months or years,
but he'll not live to be an old man.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.929
And if Rhaenyra succeeds him,

07:10.012 --> 07:13.349
war will follow, do you understand?

07:13.432 --> 07:15.226
The realm will not accept her.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.811
And to secure her claim,

07:16.894 --> 07:19.564
she'll have to put
your children to the sword.

07:19.647 --> 07:20.857
She'll have no choice.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.653
You know it.

07:25.736 --> 07:29.657
You're no fool,
and yet you choose not to see it.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.786
The time is coming, Alicent.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.707
Either you prepare Aegon to rule,

07:37.790 --> 07:41.961
or you cleave to Rhaenyra
and pray for her mercy.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.849
Where is Lord Corlys?
He should be here to receive the King.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.735
Welcome to High Tide, Your Grace.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.572
What is the meaning of this, Lady Laena?

09:33.447 --> 09:35.408
Is this how House Velaryon
greets its King?

09:36.575 --> 09:39.370
My father has but just returned
from his long journey

09:39.453 --> 09:41.247
and he has hastened to the Hall of Nine

09:41.330 --> 09:43.374
to await Your Grace's arrival.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.921
Let's just get on with it.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.141
An outsider...

10:01.058 --> 10:02.601
among the natives.

10:03.644 --> 10:04.770
Lord Larys.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.898
Malvales.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.026
A rare bloom.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.529
Indigenous to Braavos.

10:15.740 --> 10:19.327
By all rights,
it shouldn't be thriving here.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.955
Nature, such mystery.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.292
-The weather has been lovely.
-Indeed.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.919
And yet it is a dark day for the realm.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.258
Your father was a good man.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.220
As is yours who took his place.

10:41.766 --> 10:42.975
Yet still,

10:43.059 --> 10:46.145
the manner of your father's departure...

10:47.521 --> 10:50.024
it feels something of an injustice.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.070
What do you know of the matter
of his leaving?

10:54.153 --> 10:55.863
When one is never invited to speak,

10:55.946 --> 10:59.700
one learns instead to... observe.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.913
You're perhaps in need of an ally?

11:04.622 --> 11:05.831
I'm the Queen.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.334
-I have no shortage of allies.
-Naturally.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.336
Princess Rhaenyra, for example.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.381
State your purpose, my lord.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.221
I did wonder if she could be relied upon

11:20.304 --> 11:22.848
now that she is unwell.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.436
Unwell? I haven't heard anything.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.189
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace, I may be mistaken.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.568
It's just that on the very same night
your father was dismissed,

11:34.652 --> 11:38.197
the Grand Maester delivered a tea
to the Princess's chambers.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.326
-A tea?
-Yes.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.415
That the Grand Maester himself brought?

11:47.498 --> 11:50.626
At the direction of the King,
as I understand it.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.589
I do hope she's not unwell.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.343
Rhaenyra sailed with the King to Driftmark

11:59.427 --> 12:01.762
-yesterday at daybreak.
-What good news.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.432
I must've been in error.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.184
A relief.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.272
I thought for Mellos himself, well...

12:12.982 --> 12:15.526
her condition must be
something very serious.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.780
What happiness it is to have been wrong.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.228
I'm sorry.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.646
Come, cousin.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.274
Let us discover what might be had
for breakfast.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.142
Your Grace.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.034
Rise, Lord Corlys.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.870
Be welcome.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.664
May I offer you a chair?

13:53.415 --> 13:54.708
Cousin!

13:55.876 --> 13:57.169
Princess.

14:04.885 --> 14:07.012
-Are you well?
-Very.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.266
I congratulate you, Lord Lyonel.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.561
I can think of no man more suited to be
the Hand of the King.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.355
That is very kind of you to say,
Lord Corlys.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.399
His Grace has honored me with the post.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.736
Pity about Ser Otto.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.992
Despite spending most of my days
amidst the grandeur of the Red Keep,

14:28.075 --> 14:30.953
the halls of High Tide
never fail to impress.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.663
You flatter me, Your Grace.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.333
Though I do wish we could meet
under happier pretenses.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.379
-How so?
-Daemon's wife,

14:40.462 --> 14:42.548
the Lady Rhea Royce, has passed.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.926
A hunting mishap.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.012
She was thrown from her horse.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.181
Her neck and skull
both crushed in the fall.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.517
A most surprising end.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.813
Lady Rhea's skill as both
rider and hunter were well-known.

14:57.896 --> 15:00.232
-The gods are cruel.
-Indeed.

15:01.150 --> 15:06.447
Lady Rhea was a fine woman
and a good wife to my brother.

15:06.530 --> 15:10.367
Sad thing that she and Daemon
have no heirs to succeed her.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.119
She stood to inherit Runestone.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.415
Mayhaps we can turn toward
happier pursuits.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.918
-No, thank you.
-What did you have in mind, Your Grace?

15:23.839 --> 15:27.134
I wish to propose a marriage
between your son, Ser Laenor...

15:28.135 --> 15:31.013
and my daughter and heir,
the Princess Rhaenyra.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.558
It's long past time our houses
were united in blood.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.769
The last pillars of Old Valyria.

15:37.728 --> 15:41.523
You honor both me
and my house, Your Grace.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.568
There are certain details
I would wish clarified

15:44.652 --> 15:47.821
before the Princess Rhaenys
and I could accept this most...

15:48.572 --> 15:50.115
generous proposal.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.410
What details?

15:56.330 --> 15:59.875
We would like to know
how the succession will be handled.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.464
Rhaenyra is my heir.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.759
Upon my death, my throne and my titles
will pass to her.

16:08.842 --> 16:12.471
She and Ser Laenor's firstborn child,
regardless of gender,

16:12.554 --> 16:14.973
will inherit the Iron Throne from her.

16:16.934 --> 16:21.980
Can I presume that,
in keeping with Westerosi tradition...

16:23.148 --> 16:25.693
their children would take
their father's name?

16:27.236 --> 16:30.155
That they would be born Velaryons?

16:30.698 --> 16:32.491
Surely, Lord Corlys,

16:32.574 --> 16:36.078
you are not proposing
the Targaryen dynasty end with my daughter

16:36.161 --> 16:37.579
simply because she is a woman?

16:40.666 --> 16:43.210
I only seek clarity, Your Grace.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.718
-Might I have a chair brought in for you?
-I do not--

16:50.801 --> 16:52.720
No. I do not require a chair.

16:55.305 --> 16:59.435
Upon their birth,
Ser Laenor and Rhaenyra's children

16:59.518 --> 17:01.937
shall take their
father's name, Velaryon...

17:02.896 --> 17:05.941
in keeping with our traditions.

17:06.024 --> 17:07.526
However,

17:07.609 --> 17:11.405
at such time when their firstborn
ascends the Iron Throne,

17:11.488 --> 17:14.575
he or she will do so
bearing the name Targaryen.

17:16.243 --> 17:20.497
Dragons will rule the Seven Kingdoms
for the next hundred years,

17:20.581 --> 17:22.499
just as they did the last.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.639
This is an equitable compromise.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.351
Good.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.979
Now, if there's nothing further.

17:54.323 --> 17:58.577
In truth, if it had to be someone,
I'm glad it is you.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.582
I know this union is not
what you would choose.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.044
I hold nothing against you, cousin.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.505
No, I--

18:11.423 --> 18:12.549
rather...

18:13.509 --> 18:16.053
Dare I say it is a matter of taste?

18:20.057 --> 18:22.976
I prefer roast duck to goose.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.395
I cannot say why.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.943
It's not for a lack of trying.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.196
There are those who like goose very well.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.575
I find it a bit greasy for my taste.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.040
I know that whatever agreement
being struck up there

18:45.124 --> 18:47.167
will not change your appetites,

18:47.251 --> 18:49.586
nor will it change mine.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.257
And what do you propose?

18:59.137 --> 19:03.183
That we perform our duty to our fathers
and to the realm

19:03.267 --> 19:04.810
and when it's done...

19:05.519 --> 19:07.855
each of us dines as we see fit.

19:18.323 --> 19:22.119
Viserys has taken to bed
while his ship is readied.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.914
Perhaps I...

19:26.957 --> 19:28.876
overextended myself?

19:30.919 --> 19:32.296
Pushed him too close to the edge?

19:32.379 --> 19:35.924
My cousin chose to sail
into this tempest, husband.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.469
It was undignified of the King
to drag himself here

19:39.553 --> 19:41.763
and beg for Laenor's hand.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.473
Where is Laenor?

19:44.308 --> 19:47.811
-He and Rhaenyra are walking the coast.
-Good.

19:48.645 --> 19:51.189
Do they seem... familiar?

19:52.065 --> 19:53.775
They grew up together.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.029
Familiarity is not at issue.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.157
I'm sure Laenor
was already taken with her.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.367
She's grown quite comely
these last few years.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.161
You know his true nature.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.747
He's still young.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.791
He will outgrow it.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.254
There is no pleasure in the world like...

20:16.006 --> 20:17.215
bedding a woman.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.093
We are placing our son in danger.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.388
The lords of the realm
bent the knee to Rhaenyra

20:23.472 --> 20:24.681
and swore obeisance to her.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.600
That was before there
was a true-born prince

20:26.683 --> 20:28.518
named Aegon Targaryen.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.771
Rhaenyra's succession will be challenged.

20:30.854 --> 20:35.108
Knives will come out for her,
her husband, and for their heirs.

20:35.192 --> 20:39.029
Our house controls the realm's navy
and half its dragons.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.448
Anyone fool enough to challenge
Rhaenyra's claim

20:41.531 --> 20:44.660
-will be crushed.
-To what end, Corlys? Wealth? Power?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.286
-Pride?
-Justice.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.418
By all rights,

20:53.502 --> 20:56.046
you should be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.299
You were robbed of the crown by--

20:59.383 --> 21:03.553
I never wore the crown
because the realm would not have it so.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.681
And I would remedy that

21:05.764 --> 21:09.351
small-minded error by any means necessar--

21:09.434 --> 21:13.605
I myself have put the business
behind me, Corlys.

21:21.738 --> 21:24.658
I've always feared the day
you'd have to marry a woman.

21:25.742 --> 21:26.868
And now it comes.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.163
Your betrothed gives you leave

21:30.247 --> 21:32.582
of her own free will
to continue partaking of.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.669
Was I the duck or the goose?

21:35.752 --> 21:38.130
I've come to meet my fate
and you make a jape of it?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.800
Look, Rhaenyra will be
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms

21:41.883 --> 21:44.011
and you will be her king consort.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.097
Think of the tournament,

21:47.180 --> 21:49.725
the feast, the battles at sea.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.355
Will you wear your crown today,
Your Grace?

21:56.815 --> 21:58.150
You're a fool.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.493
You will need a sworn protector.

22:29.556 --> 22:32.100
This is better than we could've hoped for.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.357
She has a paramour of her own.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.737
I wonder who it is.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.304
Did sleep flee you as well this morning?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.599
I needed to see you, Princess.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.519
I confess I had a similar desire.

23:20.857 --> 23:25.570
You have confided in me now and then
over the years of our acquaintance.

23:25.654 --> 23:32.160
I feel, forgive me,
that I know you... a bit.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.581
You know more than a bit.

23:39.626 --> 23:45.382
I've heard you say so many times
how you loathe the lot of your position,

23:45.465 --> 23:47.843
that you are to be married off
at your father's whim

23:47.926 --> 23:50.512
with no thought given to the yearning
of your own heart,

23:50.595 --> 23:53.515
and now the day comes.

23:54.891 --> 23:58.812
Ser Laenor is a good and decent man,
but you did not choose him.

23:59.813 --> 24:03.942
-He was chosen for you.
-That's true.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.530
If there were another path...

24:09.698 --> 24:11.616
one that led to freedom...

24:12.534 --> 24:13.577
would you tread it?

24:15.370 --> 24:17.956
Rhaenyra, before I came here,

24:18.039 --> 24:20.917
I was a knight in the Stormlands.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.170
I have deep knowledge
of the port at Sunspear

24:23.253 --> 24:25.422
where I've seen the ships
of Essos setting sail

24:25.505 --> 24:27.841
with their hulls full
of oranges and cinnamon

24:27.924 --> 24:30.051
and I've always wished
to see where they went.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.638
Are you asking for leave?

24:35.056 --> 24:37.601
I'm asking you to come with me...

24:39.144 --> 24:41.062
away from all of this.

24:41.855 --> 24:44.816
From the burdens and indignities
of your inheritance.

24:44.900 --> 24:48.278
Let us leave it all behind
and see the world together...

24:50.113 --> 24:51.615
where we'll be nameless,

24:51.698 --> 24:53.491
and free...

24:54.242 --> 24:56.745
free to go where we like,
to love as we like.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.998
In Essos...

25:02.667 --> 25:04.252
you could marry me.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.966
A marriage for love,

25:10.050 --> 25:11.718
not for the crown.

25:36.743 --> 25:39.871
I am the crown, Ser Criston.

25:42.123 --> 25:43.667
Or I will be.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.796
I may chafe at my duties,

25:47.879 --> 25:51.049
but do you think I would choose infamy

25:51.132 --> 25:54.761
in exchange for a bushel of oranges
or a ship to Asshai?

25:58.223 --> 25:59.599
It is my duty

25:59.683 --> 26:02.769
to marry a nobleman from a great house

26:02.852 --> 26:05.397
and Ser Laenor will make a fine husband.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.778
But my...

26:12.779 --> 26:14.322
my marriage...

26:15.740 --> 26:17.867
does not have to be the end.

26:20.787 --> 26:25.709
Ser Criston, Laenor and I have
an understanding.

26:27.502 --> 26:31.339
I've granted him leave
to pursue his own interests...

26:32.465 --> 26:34.426
and in turn, he's granted me the same.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.810
So you want me to be your whore?

26:46.313 --> 26:48.857
I want us to continue as we began,

26:48.940 --> 26:52.569
with you as my sworn protector,
my white knight.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.446
I took an oath.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.659
As a knight of your Kingsguard.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.703
An oath of chastity. I've broken it.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.205
-I won't tell anyone--
-I've soiled my white cloak.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.208
And it's the only thing
I have to my fucking name!

27:09.878 --> 27:13.465
I thought if we were married,
I might be able to restore it.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.307
The Iron Throne looms larger than me,

27:22.390 --> 27:25.935
larger than anyone in my family.

27:26.019 --> 27:29.647
Aegon the Conqueror
united the Seven Kingdoms

27:29.731 --> 27:31.649
and put them on a path--

27:32.442 --> 27:33.735
Ser Criston.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.159
-Fetch the Maester!
-Get back.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.994
Get Mellos! Get back!

28:25.078 --> 28:26.621
Prepare the crucible.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.666
We'll need leeches.

28:33.586 --> 28:34.921
Ser Criston...

28:36.423 --> 28:37.549
you've been summoned.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.344
I left the Princess just minutes ago.

28:42.345 --> 28:43.888
Not the Princess, ser.

28:44.597 --> 28:45.849
The Queen.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.157
Ser Criston, Your Grace.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.455
That will be all.

29:21.134 --> 29:24.971
I fear I must question you
on a delicate matter, Ser Criston.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.226
I am your servant as always, my Queen.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.980
It concerns our dear Princess Rhaenyra.

29:35.398 --> 29:36.524
Please.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.887
You are her sworn protector
and rightly loyal to her.

30:07.096 --> 30:08.640
I am.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.437
The night of Daemon's return...

30:17.232 --> 30:18.775
there's been a rumor...

30:19.776 --> 30:24.322
or rather, my father received
an accounting of...

30:25.990 --> 30:28.576
a lapse of morals

30:28.660 --> 30:32.580
that may have occurred between--

30:35.750 --> 30:38.920
It is, of course, unthinkable for me
to question the virtue of the Princess,

30:39.003 --> 30:40.964
whom I hold in highest regard,

30:41.047 --> 30:45.301
but, I did, however, wonder if...

30:52.684 --> 30:55.812
I'm not unaware that in flush of youth...

30:56.896 --> 30:58.439
there may be errors made...

30:59.899 --> 31:02.485
breaches in resolve,

31:02.569 --> 31:05.488
-breaches, or rather lapses--
-It happened, Your Grace.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.162
The sin you allude to.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.542
I have committed it.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.340
At her instigation,
it is true, but that should--

31:25.592 --> 31:27.135
It is no excuse.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.681
My oath has been broken.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.309
I have dishonored myself.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.979
I deserve no consideration.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.359
But if...

31:44.569 --> 31:48.990
as a clement Queen,
you are inclined to pity...

31:50.450 --> 31:51.993
I would ask only this...

31:54.579 --> 31:57.165
that rather than gelding me

31:57.248 --> 31:59.375
and having me tortured

32:00.209 --> 32:03.171
you would sentence me mercifully to death.

32:18.895 --> 32:21.439
Thank you for your honesty, Ser Criston.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.867
You may go.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.193
Rest now, Your Grace.
I will bring the leeches.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.987
If I may, Grand Maester,

33:10.071 --> 33:13.616
I took the liberty
of preparing a fresh set

33:13.700 --> 33:17.745
of herbal poultices
that might be more effective.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.373
That will not be necessary, Orwyle.

33:20.456 --> 33:24.001
The leechings have always brought
His Grace relief.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.022
To help him sleep.

33:55.658 --> 33:56.951
Where's the Queen?

33:59.579 --> 34:02.623
I was given to understand that she
is otherwise occupied, Your Grace.

34:23.102 --> 34:25.229
Will I be remembered
as a good king, Lyonel?

34:27.315 --> 34:28.441
Your Grace?

34:29.609 --> 34:33.112
What will they say of me
when the histories are written?

34:34.071 --> 34:36.657
I have neither fought nor conquered,

34:36.741 --> 34:38.993
nor suffered any great defeat.

34:41.037 --> 34:43.581
Some might call that good fortune.

34:46.167 --> 34:49.128
It hardly makes a good song, does it?

34:49.212 --> 34:52.048
To be sung at feasts in a hundred years...

34:52.131 --> 34:53.674
five hundred.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.931
You have carried King Jaehaerys's legacy.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.726
And kept the realm strong.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.436
Is it not better to live in peace

35:05.520 --> 35:08.439
than to have songs
sung after you are dead?

35:09.357 --> 35:10.775
Perhaps.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.530
But there is a part of me
wishes I'd been tested.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.700
I often think that in the crucible,

35:19.784 --> 35:22.328
I may have been forged a different man.

35:24.330 --> 35:28.751
Many that are tested,
only wish to have been spared it.

35:31.128 --> 35:33.923
Another lord might assure me
that I would rise like

35:34.006 --> 35:35.883
Aegon the Conqueror given the chance.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.760
-Your Grace, that is--
-You're right.

35:38.261 --> 35:41.180
You're right as always.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.519
It is perhaps best not to know.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.319
It is with great pleasure

36:36.402 --> 36:39.697
that His Grace, King Viserys,
announces the start

36:39.780 --> 36:42.325
of the royal wedding celebrations.

36:44.327 --> 36:48.623
House Lannister with their lord,
Jason Lannister.

36:48.706 --> 36:52.752
Lord Paramount of the West,
and Master of Casterly Rock.

36:54.003 --> 36:57.632
House Hightower with their lord,
Hobert Hightower.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.885
Beacon of the South,
Defender of the Citadel,

37:00.968 --> 37:02.345
the Voice of Oldtown...

37:15.107 --> 37:16.901
Congratulations, Your Grace.

37:16.984 --> 37:19.320
You have made a fine match
for the Princess.

37:19.403 --> 37:20.988
Thank you, Lord Jason.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.074
I could think of no better man
than Ser Laenor.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.244
Well, if this is only the welcome feast,

37:27.328 --> 37:30.831
I admit, I cannot imagine what you might
have planned for the wedding.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.459
My daughter is the future queen.

37:34.460 --> 37:37.213
I wanted this to be
a wedding for the histories.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.174
Where is the Queen?

37:40.257 --> 37:42.176
I had hoped to pay my respects.

37:44.011 --> 37:48.182
I understand the Queen is still
readying herself for the celebrations.

37:48.265 --> 37:50.393
This is why men wage war

37:51.268 --> 37:53.688
because women would never
be ready for the battle in time.

37:58.901 --> 38:01.570
Your presence is always
such a pleasure, Lord Jason.

38:01.654 --> 38:04.407
Princess, Your Grace.

38:14.667 --> 38:18.921
Your Grace, Princess Rhaenyra,
congratulations are in order.

38:19.755 --> 38:22.550
We are very honored
to have you as a guest, Ser Gerold.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.593
I must say, I was most distressed

38:24.677 --> 38:27.596
to hear of the Lady Rhea's tragic passing.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.099
I'm very sorry for your loss.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.476
Lady Rhea was a unique character.

38:33.060 --> 38:36.230
Her kind is not soon to be seen again.

38:36.313 --> 38:39.233
If there is anything the crown might do
to aid House Royce--

38:47.742 --> 38:50.703
Lord Corlys of House Velaryon.

38:50.786 --> 38:53.748
Lord of the Tides, Master of Driftmark.

38:53.831 --> 38:57.293
And his lady wife,
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen.

38:57.376 --> 39:00.838
And their son and heir,
Ser Laenor Velaryon,

39:00.921 --> 39:03.466
the future king consort.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.093
-My Betrothed.

41:10.885 --> 41:14.763
Be welcome,
as we join together in celebration.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.808
Tonight is only its beginning.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.312
We honor the crown's oldest

41:21.395 --> 41:24.481
and fiercest ally, House Velaryon.

41:27.067 --> 41:32.156
Reaching back to the days of Old Valyria
and the Age of Dragons.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.827
With House Targaryen and--

42:15.741 --> 42:17.409
The King will not be happy.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.620
Right in the midst of his speech.

42:30.881 --> 42:33.259
The beacon on the Hightower,

42:33.342 --> 42:37.137
do you know what color it glows
when Oldtown calls its banners to war?

42:38.138 --> 42:39.265
Green.

42:51.151 --> 42:53.070
Congratulations, stepdaughter.

42:53.946 --> 42:55.864
What a blessing this is for you.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.128
Please be seated.

43:18.387 --> 43:19.763
Where was I?

43:19.847 --> 43:21.765
The joining of the two houses, Your Grace.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.309
Yeah.

43:24.727 --> 43:25.811
Yes.

43:31.608 --> 43:37.197
With House Targaryen
and House Velaryon united,

43:37.281 --> 43:41.327
I hope to herald in
a second Age of Dragons

43:41.410 --> 43:42.494
in Westeros.

43:53.464 --> 43:57.134
And after tonight's small affair...

43:59.011 --> 44:02.348
seven days of tournament and feasting.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.144
At the end of it all...

44:08.395 --> 44:11.732
At the end of it all, a royal wedding...

44:12.649 --> 44:14.193
between my daughter,

44:15.194 --> 44:16.320
my heir...

44:17.154 --> 44:18.697
your future Queen...

44:19.656 --> 44:23.577
and Ser Laenor Velaryon,
the heir to Driftmark.

45:16.255 --> 45:17.840
I was never much of a dancer.

45:17.923 --> 45:19.216
It's not much different to combat.

45:19.299 --> 45:21.552
I shall hope for a different outcome.

46:35.626 --> 46:39.004
-Your Grace.
-We thank you for coming, uncle.

46:39.087 --> 46:41.715
I worried that given leave of your
father's shadow,

46:41.798 --> 46:45.052
you might wither in King's Landing's sun.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.095
But you stood tall.

46:48.347 --> 46:50.682
Know that Oldtown stands with you.

47:17.459 --> 47:22.047
In the Vale,
men are made to answer for their crimes.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.717
Even Targaryens.

47:26.343 --> 47:27.302
Who are you?

47:27.386 --> 47:30.305
Ser Gerold Royce of Runestone.

47:32.140 --> 47:33.433
And?

47:42.234 --> 47:45.821
I am cousin to your late lady wife.

47:45.904 --> 47:49.032
Yes. Terrible thing.

47:49.116 --> 47:52.411
I'm positively bereft.
Such a tragic accident.

47:52.494 --> 47:55.455
You know better than anyone,
it was no accident.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.499
Are you confessing some guilt, Ser Gerold?

47:57.583 --> 48:00.335
I am making an accusation.

48:03.088 --> 48:06.508
In King's Landing,
men are made to answer for their slanders.

48:06.592 --> 48:08.302
Even old bronze cunts like you.

48:10.971 --> 48:12.264
The truth is, I'm glad you've come.

48:12.347 --> 48:14.891
I wish to speak to you
about my inheritance.

48:15.851 --> 48:18.812
-What inheritance?
-Lady Rhea and I had no heirs.

48:18.895 --> 48:22.024
As her husband, whatever she was due
now passes to me.

48:23.775 --> 48:28.196
She stood to inherit all of Runestone.
Did she not?

48:31.742 --> 48:33.910
After my niece's wedding,
I plan to fly to the Eyrie

48:33.994 --> 48:35.537
and petition Lady Jeyne myself.

48:35.621 --> 48:37.956
Perhaps I'll see you there, Ser Gerold.

49:51.655 --> 49:54.574
Has anybody ever told you
you're nearly as pretty as your brother?

49:55.200 --> 49:57.494
You flatter me, my Prince.

49:57.577 --> 50:00.163
-I was sorry to hear about your lady wife.
-Don't be, I wasn't.

50:01.206 --> 50:02.833
My lady was never very kind to me.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.376
I know who it is.

50:05.585 --> 50:07.546
The handsome paramour.

50:07.629 --> 50:08.547
Who?

50:09.548 --> 50:11.091
Ser Criston Cole.

50:11.925 --> 50:15.137
-Her sworn protector?
-Look at him.

50:15.220 --> 50:18.014
The man is fully cunt-struck.

50:18.098 --> 50:22.185
A Targaryen prince,
a dashing knight, and a dragonrider.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.895
You appear to be every
young maiden's dream.

50:23.979 --> 50:25.939
That's only because you don't know me yet.

50:26.022 --> 50:28.400
I believe Ser Criston has bloodied
that white cloak of his

50:28.483 --> 50:30.819
-with your bride's maidenhead.
-Keep your voice down.

50:30.902 --> 50:33.113
Perhaps that is something
we might remedy, my Prince.

50:33.196 --> 50:34.114
Perhaps it is.

50:35.699 --> 50:39.536
This is a good thing.
She knows your secret,

50:39.619 --> 50:40.704
and now you know hers.

50:47.210 --> 50:48.211
Hey!

50:54.843 --> 50:55.761
Hey!

50:57.846 --> 50:58.764
Hey!

51:04.895 --> 51:05.812
Hey!

51:08.064 --> 51:08.982
Hey!

51:11.443 --> 51:13.403
They make a handsome match, don't they?

51:14.362 --> 51:15.530
What?

51:16.448 --> 51:18.366
The Princess and Ser Laenor.

51:21.828 --> 51:22.746
Hey!

51:28.043 --> 51:30.545
Ser Joffrey Lonmouth,

51:30.629 --> 51:32.464
or the Knight of Kisses, they call me,

51:32.547 --> 51:34.841
though I don't know why.

51:35.634 --> 51:37.302
I'm on watch. What's your business?

51:37.385 --> 51:40.096
You don't know me, Ser Criston.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.349
But we are both deeply
invested in this union.

51:42.849 --> 51:43.767
Hey!

51:45.727 --> 51:48.897
If you have something to say,
Ser Joffrey, speak it.

51:48.980 --> 51:51.107
Ser Laenor is quite dear to me.

51:52.150 --> 51:55.278
As I know the Princess is to you.

51:57.322 --> 51:59.783
We should swear
to each other to guard them,

51:59.866 --> 52:03.411
and their secrets,
because if those are kept safe...

52:06.081 --> 52:07.999
then so are we all.

52:28.603 --> 52:29.521
Hey!

52:32.649 --> 52:33.525
Hey!

52:36.361 --> 52:37.320
Hey!

52:51.585 --> 52:54.588
-May I, Ser Harwin?
-Of course, my Prince.

53:03.388 --> 53:04.306
Hey!

53:58.860 --> 53:59.903
Hey!

54:13.083 --> 54:14.584
What in the Seven Hells is going on?

54:16.336 --> 54:17.671
Laenor!

54:52.497 --> 54:54.416
-Stop this!
-Where's Rhaenyra?

55:14.728 --> 55:16.479
Princess?

55:27.323 --> 55:28.867
Put me down!

56:22.045 --> 56:26.216
The love of the Seven
is holy and eternal.

56:27.175 --> 56:30.095
The source of life and love.

56:31.679 --> 56:36.059
We stand here tonight in thanks and praise

56:36.142 --> 56:39.687
to join two souls as one.

56:44.818 --> 56:46.069
Father...

56:48.613 --> 56:49.948
Mother...

56:52.158 --> 56:53.493
Warrior...

56:54.786 --> 56:56.121
Smith...

56:57.372 --> 56:58.706
Maiden...

56:59.541 --> 57:01.042
Crone...

57:01.709 --> 57:03.253
Stranger.

57:05.296 --> 57:07.841
Hear now their vows.

57:09.634 --> 57:12.554
I am yours and you are mine.

57:15.348 --> 57:17.058
Whatever may come.

57:20.186 --> 57:22.522
I am yours and you are mine.

57:23.565 --> 57:24.899
Whatever may come.

57:25.775 --> 57:30.155
Here, in the presence
of gods and men,

57:30.238 --> 57:31.781
I proclaim...

57:33.283 --> 57:35.827
Laenor of House Velaryon...

57:37.996 --> 57:41.457
Rhaenyra of House Targaryen,

57:41.541 --> 57:43.459
to be man and wife.

57:47.088 --> 57:49.090
One flesh...

57:49.966 --> 57:51.509
one heart...

57:52.552 --> 57:54.095
one soul...

57:55.805 --> 57:58.349
now and forever.

57:59.184 --> 58:01.102
Ser Criston.
