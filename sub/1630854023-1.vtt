TRINITIE:
Every woman is not built for

01:28.963 --> 01:32.258
the great responsibility
of being a first lady.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.554
Lee-Curtis and I...

01:36.596 --> 01:38.181
(sighs)

01:38.223 --> 01:40.767
...we're just gonna get
to the other side.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.770
Always, we're gonna get
to the other side.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.188
You know...

01:45.980 --> 01:47.565
Have you ever seen a rat

01:47.607 --> 01:50.860
go from the inside of a house
to the outside of a house?

01:50.902 --> 01:52.654
They chew through.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.532
So we're-we're gonna gnaw
through the hardest parts.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.951
I mean, not that
we're rats, obviously,

01:57.992 --> 02:00.370
but just that tenacity.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.918
So that's good. You can cut.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.962
* Now, ever since

LEE-CURTIS:
God favors those who favor him,

02:27.689 --> 02:31.026

and physically.

in agreement)

02:32.360 --> 02:34.487
-I mean, check me out.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.302
-to pay off the entire debt
of the county.-Praise Jesus!

02:57.344 --> 02:59.679
God loves those who worship him.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.349
You know that Rolls-Royce
out there in the parking lot?

03:02.390 --> 03:03.725
I didn't buy that.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.436
The helicopter?
It's not really mine, no.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.689
All of these wonderful things
are because I worked hard

03:09.731 --> 03:12.192
-and invested in God!
-(cheering)

03:12.233 --> 03:13.526

Pastor Childs,
are the allegations true?

03:57.821 --> 03:58.822
-Sir!
-No comment.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.448
First Lady,
do you have any comment?

04:00.490 --> 04:01.741
A little space, please.
Thank you very much.

04:01.783 --> 04:02.701
First Lady Childs,
will you stay?

04:07.622 --> 04:09.749
LEE-CURTIS: Maybe I should
dip into the Old Testament

04:09.791 --> 04:11.084
a bit more.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.544
TRINITIE:
Mm. Mm-hmm.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.754
I like some of
the Old Testament.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.089
It's got rigor.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.507
Could be good for our new look.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.676
Straddling the new and the old.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.053
I could perfect
a good powerful straddle,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.263
don't you think?

04:23.304 --> 04:25.682
(silverware scraping plate
rapidly)

04:26.891 --> 04:29.352
Uh, baby.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.770
Uh, scraping.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.521
(teeth click)

04:31.563 --> 04:33.982
That's Memaw's china.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.154
Something on your mind?

04:39.195 --> 04:40.613
(sighs)

04:40.655 --> 04:41.865
Mm.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.951
We just have a big day
ahead of us, that's all.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.123
It's about the cameras.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.208
And you're nervous.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.336
-Don't be.
-It's just making sure

04:54.377 --> 04:56.171
that this doesn't end up
poorly for us.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.423
Anita Bonet is
a renowned filmmaker.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.091
-I've never heard of her.
-Come on, now.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.468
She done won awards.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.927
Be all up and through
them film festivals.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.387
Okay. Well...

05:04.429 --> 05:07.974
This is gonna chronicle
the ultimate comeback.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.227
This Easter is our revival.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.355
Our renaissance.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.314
(taps feet rhythmically)

05:14.356 --> 05:16.441
We winners, baby.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.443
You married a winner.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.070
And that's all I intend to do.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.280
Hey, I'm Rocky
up in this fight.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.074
(grunts)

05:24.115 --> 05:25.450
(laughing)

05:28.495 --> 05:30.955
Rocky didn't win.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.540
How's that, now?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.125
Well, he-he went the distance,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.670
you know, the whole 15 rounds
against Apollo Creed,

05:36.711 --> 05:39.923
but he didn't...
he didn't actually win.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.012
All right.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.973
But he did win in Rocky II.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.059
Lord, baby, how many times
I got to tell you?

05:51.101 --> 05:52.185
Get past the first movie.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.020
That one's all setup!

05:54.062 --> 05:55.313
Lord have mercy.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.315
(doorbell rings)

05:57.357 --> 05:59.901
(sighs) Jesus, they're here.

06:00.902 --> 06:01.986
TRINITIE:
Mm.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.365
(breathes deeply)

06:05.407 --> 06:06.741
Mm.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.036
We're doing this.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.707
(whispers):
Showtime.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.792
* *

06:18.962 --> 06:21.297
TRINITIE: This has
been our place of ministry for,

06:21.339 --> 06:23.341
whew, well,
almost nine years now.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.720
You know, we-we started out
small but just grew like weeds.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.346
-Didn't it, hon?
-LEE-CURTIS: Sure did.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.598
And before long,
we had all this.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.892
That's all through the
blessings of the Lord, though.

06:32.934 --> 06:38.314
26,000 members
every single Sunday!

06:38.356 --> 06:39.899
It was a sight to see.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.401
TRINITIE:
Mm-hmm. Yes, it was.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.902
Now, I'm telling y'all,

06:42.944 --> 06:45.238
you should have seen this place
when it was jumping.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.240
Course, it hasn't looked like
that for a while, obviously.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.658
No. No.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.326
But we gonna get that all back.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.619
Oh, yeah, we will.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.788
Have this place looking all--
Oh.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.667
-Shit. Shit!
-Oh. Oh, boy.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.419
-Oh, my goodness.
-Now, how in the good Lord's

06:59.461 --> 07:01.838
-lush green earth is anybody
supposed to take me... -Okay.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.548
...and the resurrection
of my church seriously if I...

07:03.590 --> 07:05.216
-(clears throat) It-- Yes.
-These are Fianos!

07:05.258 --> 07:07.677
-Those are-- that's an
Italian brand. -(groans) Sorry.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.263
-So...
-Uh, we can edit around that,

07:10.305 --> 07:12.515
-right, Anita?
-Yeah.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.143
-Can she hear?
-I don't know.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.186
Anita!

07:16.227 --> 07:18.271
Ah. That's right.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.647
Y'all the fly-on-the-walls
type?

07:19.689 --> 07:20.982
They're not gonna talk back
to you, baby.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.942
That's not how they do this.
(chuckles)

07:22.984 --> 07:24.319
Okay.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.112
Y'all got to excuse
my unholy language back there.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.489
-Yes, yes.
-I just...

07:27.530 --> 07:29.908
-Yes. I would've got mad
at that, too. -Whoo.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.118
-(Lee-Curtis grunts)
-Even, uh, Jesus lost it

07:32.160 --> 07:33.620
in the temple that day.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.789
(laughs): It probably was gum
in the temple, too.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.332
Okay, strength of the Lord.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.458
Won't he do it?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.876
-All the time.
-Won't he do it?

07:39.918 --> 07:40.877
All the time.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.045
Oh. Okay.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.381
Uh, over there is
our creative arts center.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.049
They ain't ready. Come on.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.634
That's where our world-renowned
dance ministries rehearse.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.512
We got hip-hop.
We got ribbon twirling.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.805
-Miming.
-Right in there.

07:51.846 --> 07:55.183
Now, have y'all ever seen
praise miming?

07:55.225 --> 07:57.644
'Cause we do it all the time
here, right, Trin?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.604
-(grunting rhythmically)
-(chuckling)

08:00.897 --> 08:02.649
-(scatting)
-(laughing)

08:02.691 --> 08:05.235
-Uh-oh. (laughs)
-Ooh, boy!

08:05.276 --> 08:06.820
Uh, y'all l-look
at the railings?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.154
LEE-CURTIS:
You know, we like to keep

08:08.196 --> 08:09.948
a few options here
on the church's campus.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.950
-Never know when you're
gonna need something. -Yeah.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.036
This one time, a White House
correspondent stopped by...

08:15.078 --> 08:17.831
-Oh. -...and I had on
something fantastic.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.332
-Yes. Yeah.
-It was a pinstripe.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.042
-(clicks tongue) But...
-(chuckles)

08:21.084 --> 08:23.670
...do pinstripes evoke
matters of state? No, no.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.673
Luckily, we had all this here
to switch it up.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.174
-Mm-hmm.
-And this is just as important

08:28.216 --> 08:29.676
-as any White House visit.
-Yeah, yeah.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.594
-All right?
-Ab-- Yeah, absolutely.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.847
So, uh, what are you
thinking, hon?

08:33.888 --> 08:37.475
What is calling you
for our first Sunday back?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.768
None of these.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.186
-Mm-mm. Nothing in here.
-No?

08:40.228 --> 08:42.731
See, our first Sunday back
is Easter Sunday,

08:42.772 --> 08:44.524
-and that-- right?
-Yeah, yeah.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.693
That deserves
something special.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.653
Something new.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.030
-Uh, yeah.
-Yeah.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.740
-You-you sure? Nothing in here?
-May I?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.074
-I'm gonna tell you
what I'm thinking. -Oh. Okay.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.326
I'm thinking Prada.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.703
-Right? (laughs)
-Mm.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.371
TRINITIE: There is--
I'm t-- I'm telling you,

08:58.413 --> 09:01.374
there is just something about
a pastor in Prada.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.834
It just-- it gives you chills.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.713
Well, I have been blessed
with some beautiful Prada.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.881
(both grunt)

09:07.922 --> 09:09.716
-(Trinitie laughs)
-What you think?

09:09.758 --> 09:12.969
-Uh, purple Prada?
-Hmm. I like the color.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.554
TRINITIE:
You know what?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.056
We don't want to go
too extravagant.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.350
Yeah, we want people
to really see us,

09:18.391 --> 09:20.060
look deep into our souls,

09:20.101 --> 09:22.812
and I don't think you quite
get there with the purple.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.941
This is nice, too.
Y'all can get...

09:26.983 --> 09:29.402
-That's cute!
-Yeah, it's real cute.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.821
-Oh, my goodness. I like it.
-I like it. I like it.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.074
-I like that, too. I like it.
-I like that. Come on, now.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.533
(laughs)

09:35.575 --> 09:38.244
-Oh, you got the peach Prada.
-I got the peach Prada.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.122
-The periwinkle Prada. (laughs)
-The periwinkle Prada.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.792
-The pearl Prada.
-Pearl Prada. We got a--

09:43.833 --> 09:46.086
Lord have mercy.
I got a pearl...

09:46.127 --> 09:47.712
-(laughs)
-(mumbling playfully)

09:47.754 --> 09:49.756
Look at him. Look at him!

09:49.798 --> 09:51.675
-(laughs)
-(kisses loudly)

09:51.716 --> 09:54.302
LEE-CURTIS: Some
people think it's excessive.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.640
My old deacon board.

10:00.100 --> 10:04.145
They get so riled up about
some of these divine additions.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.357
And it just got, uh...

10:07.399 --> 10:08.775
unmanageable.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.527
I prayed on it, though.

10:10.568 --> 10:14.197
And God eventually told me
to just be free.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.117
See, the Lord revealed
unto Lee-Curtis that deacons,

10:17.158 --> 10:18.910
well, they just-- they didn't
work for our ministry.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.620
-Mm, you know what he told me?
-Hmm.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.080
He told me that I needed to be

10:22.122 --> 10:25.208
rid of such an ungodly
governmental structure.

10:25.250 --> 10:28.128
Yeah, yeah.
That-that was a quote, too.

10:28.169 --> 10:33.341
Because what good are disciples
if they are undisciplined?

10:40.348 --> 10:41.641
It's not to worry, though.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.476
It's, uh, just
a slight unpleasantness.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.644
All a thing of the past.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.146
And now look.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.397
(both chuckle)

10:47.439 --> 10:50.358
Now we've been blessed
with an indoor fountain.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.110
-Yeah. (laughs)
-Baby.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.737
-Baby, go turn the fountain on
for me. -Oh. Yes.

10:53.778 --> 10:54.696
Sorry. Excuse me.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.990
(both laughing)

10:57.032 --> 10:59.784
-Wait till you see it.
-Here we go. Here we go.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.162
(mouthing)

11:06.207 --> 11:07.792
Mm.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.838
Mm.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.174
What you think? Come here.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.967
(laughing)

11:17.635 --> 11:19.512
Mm.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.014
-Give them the finger.
-Okay.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.432
-Bang.
-Oh, right here.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.434
-Smile. Smile.
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

11:24.476 --> 11:26.728
* *

11:28.355 --> 11:30.231
HOST: All right,
caller, you're on the air

11:30.273 --> 11:32.776
with LT and Jamila
here on WRX 104.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.235
And we're about to get into

11:34.277 --> 11:36.529
this whole Wander to
Greater Paths situation.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.114
What are some of your thoughts?

11:38.156 --> 11:39.908
WOMAN: I mean, I'm really
hoping they open back up.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.284
Pastor Childs and his sermons

11:41.326 --> 11:43.244
were the reason
I got my shit together

11:43.286 --> 11:45.580
and stopped running numbers and
dedicated my life to Christ.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.415
Ooh, and if they looking
to put folks in the movie,

11:47.457 --> 11:49.292
I just want to say
that I act and sing.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.710
I do hair. I could do...

11:50.752 --> 11:52.629
NEWSWOMAN:
Prominent megachurch pastor

11:52.671 --> 11:54.547
Lee-Curtis Childs faces

11:54.589 --> 11:56.841
allegations of
sexual misconduct.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.635
He maintains that
all the allegations

11:58.677 --> 11:59.969
against him are false.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.805
Criminal charges are not

12:01.846 --> 12:04.140
a part of the discussion, but
a settlement is on the table,

12:04.182 --> 12:06.476
with many speculating
the payoffs have begun.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.894
MAN:
Niggas keep shouting

12:07.936 --> 12:09.938
"victim this, victim that."

12:09.979 --> 12:11.398
Ain't no motherfucking victims.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.733
Y'all tell me.
The pastor break the law?

12:13.775 --> 12:15.235
No? A'ight, then.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.070
NEWSMAN:
As a result of the allegations,

12:17.112 --> 12:19.072
Trinitie Childs, the first lady
of the Baptist church,

12:19.114 --> 12:21.199
has been mum
but has stuck by her husband.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.451
WOMAN 2:
What I don't get is his wife.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.036
How could she not know?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.913
How could she stand
being with a man like that?

12:26.955 --> 12:28.915
-Ugh. Just makes my skin crawl.
-(reporters clamoring)

12:28.957 --> 12:30.500
LEE-CURTIS: Please.
A little space. Thank you.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.127
REPORTER:
Do you have any comment?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.336
No comment?

12:33.378 --> 12:35.463
(thunder rumbling softly)

12:36.798 --> 12:38.800
SHAKURA:
Although we're both pastors

12:38.842 --> 12:40.760
at Heaven's House,

12:40.802 --> 12:42.429
the Pastor
and First Lady Childs

12:42.470 --> 12:45.140
have been a huge inspiration
for us,

12:45.181 --> 12:47.767
as up-and-coming
church leaders, of course.

12:47.809 --> 12:51.771
(chuckles)
But also as-as a couple

12:51.813 --> 12:54.065
covered under the Lord.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.775
-KEON: It's just...
-Uh...

12:55.817 --> 12:57.736
It's so sticky.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.988
-So sticky.
-This situation.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.991
But we only pray for the best

13:03.033 --> 13:05.118
-for everyone involved.
-Mm-hmm.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.911
And prayer works, y'all.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.831
When all this was
first going down,

13:09.873 --> 13:11.958
I prayed that
the first lady would

13:12.000 --> 13:15.170
un-file those divorce papers
she served the pastor.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.339
And look what the Lord did.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.382
Kept those two beautiful souls
together.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.802
That is a silver lining
if ever there was one.

13:22.844 --> 13:26.473
That and
our congregation growth.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.976
-Now, not that we wish
anyone's downfall... -No.

13:30.018 --> 13:33.021
...but the fact that these
souls had another church home

13:33.063 --> 13:35.106
to go to
for the good Word of God,

13:35.148 --> 13:38.068
-that is also a blessing.
-Amen.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.861
-'Cause we want to help heal
this community. -(chuckles)

13:39.903 --> 13:41.654
-(laughs) Right?
-Yes.

13:41.696 --> 13:45.075
And-and I just hope
that the Lord will see everyone

13:45.116 --> 13:49.037
through this, uh, absolute
landfill of a circumstance.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.420
-We could only hope...
-Mm.

13:57.462 --> 14:01.257
...to achieve
that sanctified success

14:01.299 --> 14:03.760
that Wander
to Greater Paths has.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.011
(chuckling)

14:05.053 --> 14:07.138
One of these days, huh?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.933
* One of these days, huh? *

14:09.974 --> 14:12.352
* One of these days *

14:12.394 --> 14:15.480
-* One of these days *
-* One of these days *

14:15.522 --> 14:17.190
(laughing)

14:17.232 --> 14:19.901
-* One of these days *
-* One of these days *

14:19.943 --> 14:21.695
Hey, did-did y'all find,
um, parking okay?

14:21.736 --> 14:23.238
'Cause we had to add
a little, um,

14:23.279 --> 14:26.282
overflow section
to the parking lot recently.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.325
You did?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.160
Okay. All right. Wonderful.
(laughs)

14:29.202 --> 14:31.955
-* One of these days *
-* One of these days. *

14:32.747 --> 14:35.000
LEE-CURTIS:
Um...

14:35.041 --> 14:37.210
let me tell you something
about the devil.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.880
He'll creep up on you

14:40.922 --> 14:45.927
and just crawl his way into
your life and under your skin

14:45.969 --> 14:47.971
like a...

14:49.264 --> 14:52.475
...roach under the floorboards.

14:54.144 --> 14:57.063
He'll hold on tight, too.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.565
TRINITIE:
Uh, look.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.858
(laughs) Look.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.276
-We've prayed. Okay?
-We have.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.987
We-we-we are past this stage
in our lives now.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.905
Now we are here.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.449
-Right here.
-Yes.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.993
And, uh, ready
to get back to just

15:10.035 --> 15:11.578
-doing good Christian work.
-Mm.

15:11.619 --> 15:15.582
Anyways, so we got
some good people outside

15:15.623 --> 15:17.751
-waiting to come in
and meet y'all. -Yeah.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.003
-They are...
-(sighs)

15:20.045 --> 15:22.797
our real followers.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.674
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.301
They stuck by us.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.470
Even with all the awfulness

15:28.511 --> 15:31.097
-that-that folks was conjuring.
-Yeah.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.932
And they're gonna be
sanctified witnesses

15:32.974 --> 15:35.643
to what you all
are about to see.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.104
DEACONESS:
Oh, we're here

15:38.146 --> 15:39.481
because we want to be.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.232
When I was coming up
through the church,

15:41.274 --> 15:43.151
you didn't just up and leave
your place of worship

15:43.193 --> 15:44.736
because of any old thing.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.071
-(laughs)
-Mm-mm.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.073
Besides, wasn't nothing
even confirmed.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.532
I bet this whole talk
of a settlement

15:49.574 --> 15:51.826
is just to get the thing
good and over with.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.620
I don't think
that you're posing

15:53.661 --> 15:55.622
the right questions here,
my beautiful sister.

15:55.663 --> 15:59.000
When will we,
as a Christian culture,

15:59.042 --> 16:02.003
realize that
we got it all wrong?

16:02.045 --> 16:05.048
Pastor Childs is just
ahead of his time.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.549
He's a visionary.

16:06.591 --> 16:09.302
Well, little Aria here
only likes a few things.

16:09.344 --> 16:13.014
That's paintball guns,
real guns, church

16:13.056 --> 16:15.809
and that TV show
where the little animals talk

16:15.850 --> 16:17.477
in the high-pitched voices.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.813
Once you weigh everything out,
church was the least taxing,

16:19.854 --> 16:21.773
so we try to do it
as much as we can.

16:21.815 --> 16:22.899
Don't we, little Aria?

16:22.941 --> 16:24.859
Come back down here.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.319
Now, let me tell you something.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.238
The church I came up at
when I was a little girl,

16:28.279 --> 16:30.240
the musical director
was found out

16:30.281 --> 16:31.991
to be in one of
those sex groups.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.744
You know, those, um, um...

16:34.786 --> 16:36.996
-Orgies.
-Uh, yup. Mm-hmm.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.165
And-and not just
the regular ones.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.960
Had him crawling round
on all fours,

16:42.002 --> 16:44.963
pretending he was
a horse and such.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.756
You know what the elders did?

16:46.798 --> 16:48.174
They kept him.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.094
His service had done
more for our church

16:51.136 --> 16:54.431
than just any old discretions
could soil.

16:54.472 --> 16:58.143
Pastor Childs' word
saves folks.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.353
And you don't just go
replacing somebody

17:00.395 --> 17:02.480
with the spirit of the Lord
in him like that.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.192
A lot of the former
WTGP members ran right on over

17:06.234 --> 17:08.737
to Heaven's House
with Pastor and Pastor Sumpter.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.239
-I just don't think...
-LEE-CURTIS: Excuse me?

17:13.491 --> 17:16.369
The, uh, Sumpters, did you say?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.837
He has so much love.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.798
It's just about written in the
Bible that he should spread it

17:28.840 --> 17:31.426
as far and wide as he can.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.512
Now, to whom it spreads to...

17:35.638 --> 17:40.185
...well, that's gonna require
our deepest prayers.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.104
But he'll get right.
I believe him.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.482
You know what, let me just go

17:45.523 --> 17:47.275
-spruce myself up a bit,
-(laughs)

17:47.317 --> 17:50.195
then we can really get
this thing started off right.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.489
Y'all just give me one moment.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.407
-Gonna get my good jacket.
-(laughs)

17:54.449 --> 17:56.576
(Lee-Curtis clears throat)

17:56.618 --> 17:58.536
Oh, my goodness.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.081
(chuckles)

18:01.122 --> 18:03.708
Um, Anita, can we--
can you cut for a sec?

18:03.750 --> 18:07.295
I just want to clarify some
things before we... (sighs)

18:07.337 --> 18:10.215
before we get started,
just make sure

18:10.256 --> 18:13.093
that we're working towards
the same goal.

18:13.134 --> 18:15.929
Okay?
You know, it's, uh, well...

18:15.970 --> 18:17.430
(sighs)

18:17.472 --> 18:20.475
Lee-Curtis is working
so, so hard.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.936
So hard.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.938
And so am I, you know?

18:24.979 --> 18:26.773
You-you...

18:29.651 --> 18:32.654
You got to be strong
to be a first lady.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.241
Smart. Uh...

18:36.991 --> 18:39.285
Diligent. Uh, uh...

18:39.327 --> 18:43.915
It's-it's real mental
and psychological gymnastics.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.459
And, um...

18:46.501 --> 18:48.420
well...

18:48.461 --> 18:52.799
The pastor may be
the-the head and face

18:52.841 --> 18:54.884
of a congregation, but...

18:56.219 --> 19:00.015
...the neck and-and the spine,
the-the...

19:00.056 --> 19:01.307
(exhales sharply)

19:01.349 --> 19:03.351
the structure?

19:07.313 --> 19:10.025
That is all the first lady.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.485
And so...

19:12.527 --> 19:16.031
I just need to make sure
that we are structurally sound.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.866
Okay, Anita?

19:17.907 --> 19:21.578
I-I... I need to know that
we're on the same team.

19:21.619 --> 19:24.831
-That we want to make
a great film because... -Hey.

19:24.873 --> 19:27.375
-Well, because that's what
we want to make. -Hey, hey.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.128
-(laughing) -Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.255
Baby. Baby! Come on, now.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.257
I already told you that
these are good people.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.759
Yes. Yes. Yes.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.844
They only care about
what the world cares about.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.847
And what the world cares about
is a man of God

19:40.889 --> 19:43.683
back and better than ever
as a new and improved preacher.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.852
-Ain't that right, y'all?
-Mm-hmm.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.313
Uh, so like I said...
(clears throat)

19:48.355 --> 19:50.648
we got some good people outside

19:50.690 --> 19:52.150
waiting to come in
and meet y'all.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.444
-Oh, boy. (laughs)
-Mm-hmm.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.530
You there.

19:57.572 --> 20:00.200
Yeah, with
the big old microphone.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.701
Come in closer, son.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.578
-No, no, that's...
-It's okay.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.247
-Closer. Come on, son.
-I think that's good.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.541
-Right there. -You gonna want
to hear all of this. All right?

20:08.583 --> 20:10.126
-Yeah. -They gonna want
to hear all of this.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.211
Everybody can hear.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.380
-All right, everyone.
-(sighs)

20:13.421 --> 20:15.965
-I've gathered you here
today... -Mm.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.885
...to culminate
the first day of my rebirth

20:18.927 --> 20:20.929
-the right way.
-(sighs)

20:20.970 --> 20:23.014
I am new.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.557
Mm.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.268
And I will submit my newness
right here in front of you

20:27.310 --> 20:31.147
and in the eyes of the Lord.

20:31.189 --> 20:32.816
But first...

20:32.857 --> 20:34.401
(laughs)

20:34.442 --> 20:37.987
...you gonna see
what all the fuss is about.

20:39.906 --> 20:40.949
(laughing)

20:40.990 --> 20:43.576
-Showtime!
-Oh. Uh-oh.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.703
Come here.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.496
-No, no, no. (laughs)
-No, no. I just--

20:46.538 --> 20:47.914
I'm just trying to see
if I can get a rise out of her.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.582
-No. No.
-Hey, now!

20:50.375 --> 20:52.627
Today's word.

20:54.129 --> 20:56.631
Restraint
in the name of the Lord.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.592
Now, who here can name
an instance from the Bible

20:59.634 --> 21:03.304
where the lack of restraint
was punished?

21:04.264 --> 21:06.433
Little Aria, go ahead, baby.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.436
Um, well, um,

21:09.477 --> 21:14.441
in my last class, we, um,
learned about Adam and Eve.

21:14.482 --> 21:19.738
And they were bad because
they didn't listen to God.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.323
-(Lee-Curtis claps)
-That's right, sweetheart.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.284
Look at you making your way

21:24.325 --> 21:26.119
-in a grown-up service.
-(congregants chuckling)

21:26.161 --> 21:28.663
This little baby
is right on it.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.458
Mm. Did Eve show restraint,
little Aria?

21:31.499 --> 21:32.625
No, Pastor Childs.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.502
Did she ignore God's graces

21:34.544 --> 21:37.797
and allow herself to be swayed
by temptation?

21:37.839 --> 21:40.133
-Yes, sir, Pastor Childs.
Yes, sir. -Ooh.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.177
Women!

21:42.218 --> 21:44.137
The "wo-man."

21:44.179 --> 21:46.222
The birther
of the original sin.

21:46.264 --> 21:49.601
But you have the blessing
of restraint deep within you.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.311
-Can I get an amen?
-CONGREGANTS: Amen!

21:51.353 --> 21:54.606
-(organ chords playing) -But
you're gonna need to suit up,

21:54.647 --> 21:58.318
because the journey
to holy restraint is a battle.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.028
-Right.
-And to win that battle,

22:00.070 --> 22:01.821
-you gonna need every tool
that you can think of. -Praise!

22:01.863 --> 22:03.490
-(scattered shouting)
-You gonna need

22:03.531 --> 22:06.618
the sword of the Spirit
to cut through evil!

22:06.659 --> 22:09.454
You gonna need the shield
of faith to keep the devil

22:09.496 --> 22:11.164
from penetrating your soul!

22:11.206 --> 22:16.252
But you got to bring yourself
to our Lord and Savior

22:16.294 --> 22:17.712
in order to receive them.

22:17.754 --> 22:18.922
Yes.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.466
Are you ready
for your blessings, baby?

22:21.508 --> 22:23.510
ARIA:
I want all my blessings!

22:23.551 --> 22:25.887
Then come get 'em. Ooh.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.098
-(congregants whooping)
-DEACON: Oh, Jesus!

22:28.139 --> 22:29.224
Hallelujah.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.393
LEE-CURTIS:
Bless this child.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.436
(Lee-Curtis grunts)

22:33.478 --> 22:34.938
(organ playing flourishes)

22:34.979 --> 22:37.524
-Praise you, Jesus.
-(Sapphire whoops)

22:37.565 --> 22:41.403
* I know he's all right *

22:41.444 --> 22:43.405
-DEACON: Oh, yes, yes!
-KENSINGTON: Yes, God.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.074
* I know he's all right *

22:46.116 --> 22:48.368
-DEACON: Thank you, Lord Jesus.
-SAPPHIRE: Praise him, baby.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.411
LEE-CURTIS:
Yes, praise him.

22:49.452 --> 22:50.578
(speaking in tongues)

22:50.620 --> 22:52.205
Lord, God Almighty.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.873
Yes, Lord! Yes, God!

22:53.915 --> 22:56.918
(congregants
speaking in tongues)

23:00.964 --> 23:02.507
LEE-CURTIS:
Come on!

23:03.258 --> 23:04.884
I love the theater.

23:04.926 --> 23:06.886
(congregants continue
speaking in tongues)

23:06.928 --> 23:09.222
Yes, Lord God.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.433
-(organ playing gentle music)
-Mm.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.978
I feel you in me.

23:15.770 --> 23:19.065
I feel you deep within me.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.401
Hallelujah.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.611
You know what you were
pushing me to be.

23:23.653 --> 23:28.074
To be the best possible version
of myself that I can be.

23:32.454 --> 23:36.624
You're pushing me
to be brand-new.

23:41.296 --> 23:43.006
(exhales slowly)

23:46.634 --> 23:49.137
To be brand-new!

23:52.390 --> 23:55.101
I have been
crucified with Christ,

23:55.143 --> 23:57.354
and I no longer live.

23:57.395 --> 24:00.690
But Christ lives in me.

24:00.732 --> 24:03.443
The life I now live
in the body, I live by faith

24:03.485 --> 24:04.944
-in the Son of God...
-Whoo.

24:04.986 --> 24:06.571
It's chilly.

24:06.613 --> 24:09.532
...who loved me
and gave himself for me.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.659
TRINITIE:
Lord, we come to you

24:11.701 --> 24:13.828
on this glorious day.

24:13.870 --> 24:18.958
Allow us to stay strong
and know that when man falters,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.212
-God stays steady and sure.
-Yes. Yes, God.

24:22.253 --> 24:26.007
Buried with him
in the likeness of his death.

24:26.049 --> 24:29.219
Raised with him in the likeness
of his resurrection

24:29.260 --> 24:32.263
to walk in the newness of life.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.516
(Lee-Curtis inhales deeply)

24:39.479 --> 24:41.564
TRINITIE (quietly):
Yes, Lord.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.566
Yes, Jesus.

24:48.113 --> 24:51.074
Oh, God. Yes. Yes, God.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.829
-(gasping)
-(congregants shout excitedly)

24:55.870 --> 24:57.539
-KENSINGTON: Hallelujah!
-DEACON: Praise!

24:57.580 --> 24:59.374
Saved...

24:59.416 --> 25:00.834
Saved again.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.628
-Hallelujah! Thank you.
-Hallelujah! -Praise!

25:03.670 --> 25:06.339
-Saved again!
-(excited murmuring)

25:06.381 --> 25:09.634
Hear us, Lord. Thank you, Lord.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.554
In Jesus's name we pray.

25:12.595 --> 25:14.973
-"Ay-men!"
-"Ah-men!"

25:16.558 --> 25:18.601
-Now, I thought we said...
-No.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.312
No, no, no. No. Uh...

25:21.354 --> 25:23.690
We agreed, remember?

25:23.732 --> 25:25.442
-We agreed that "ah-men"
was a little... -(stammers)

25:25.483 --> 25:28.361
No, but I just think we got to
keep up with the times. Right?

25:28.403 --> 25:30.905
And all the people that's hot
and popping on the Internet,

25:30.947 --> 25:33.825
-they say the "ay-men."
-Okay.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.660
Remember,
we are on the same page.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.995
-Yeah. Yes, we are.
-Okay? Right.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.496
-Of course we are. Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, okay.

25:38.538 --> 25:39.873
Uh, Anita, we're gonna take

25:39.914 --> 25:42.250
that last part, uh,
one more time, okay?

25:42.292 --> 25:45.045
Everyone, we're gonna take
that last part one more time!

25:45.086 --> 25:45.879
SAPPHIRE:
Okay.

25:45.920 --> 25:49.507
In Jesus's name we pray.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.926
-"Ay-men!"
-"Ah-men!"

25:55.055 --> 25:57.098
* *

26:14.199 --> 26:16.117

They used to be so...

27:52.547 --> 27:53.506
...midsized.

27:53.548 --> 27:55.091
So average.

27:55.133 --> 27:59.137
LEE-CURTIS: I never noticed
how young they are.

28:01.181 --> 28:03.099
Shit.

(Trinitie sighs)

28:30.001 --> 28:31.753
(Lee-Curtis moans)

28:31.795 --> 28:33.797
TRINITIE (moaning):
I did feel the Lord

28:33.838 --> 28:35.924
in your word today, Lee-Curtis.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.717
-You love God?
-Yes.

28:37.759 --> 28:38.927
Is he deep
in your spirit, baby?

28:38.968 --> 28:40.428
-Yes.
-Do you feel him?

28:40.470 --> 28:43.473
I need to feel him.
Please let me feel him.

28:43.515 --> 28:44.724
(both moaning)

28:44.766 --> 28:46.685
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

28:46.726 --> 28:47.936
-What? What?
-Wait.

28:47.977 --> 28:50.605

I thought we were gonna...

28:50.647 --> 28:51.856
You what? What?

28:51.898 --> 28:53.900
Well, I just--
I thought we might,

28:53.942 --> 28:57.404
we might try it
the regular way tonight.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.114
(Lee-Curtis panting)

28:59.155 --> 29:01.741
-Yeah, okay. Okay. Come on.
-Okay. Yeah.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.535
Come on. (grunts)

29:03.576 --> 29:04.869
Okay.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.163
(both moaning, panting)

29:08.456 --> 29:09.749
Oh, that's nice.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.751
Right there. Oh, right there.

29:11.793 --> 29:12.752
I'm there.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.087
Yes. Right there.

29:14.129 --> 29:15.714
-I'm there. I'm in there.
-Right there.

29:15.755 --> 29:16.965
(moans) Wait.

29:17.007 --> 29:18.925
-Oh, I love you.
-(grunting)

29:18.967 --> 29:20.885
Are you, are you, are you,
are you all the way in?

29:20.927 --> 29:22.387
-I'm there. I'm there.
-Are you...

29:22.429 --> 29:24.347
It's just... I just got...

29:24.389 --> 29:26.099
Well, just-- hold on.
Just give me a second.

29:26.141 --> 29:29.310
-Okay. It's okay. Okay.
-(groans)

29:30.478 --> 29:31.980
-Come on.
-All right.

29:32.022 --> 29:34.357
-Can I help?
-Not yet.

29:36.192 --> 29:39.362
(whispers):
Come on, please. Please.

29:39.404 --> 29:42.198
-Okay. Okay.
-(groans)

29:44.993 --> 29:46.369
-Hey, uh...
-It's okay.

29:46.411 --> 29:49.956
-Can we, um...
-Yeah?

29:49.998 --> 29:52.917
Can you just, can you just
do the other thing?

29:55.670 --> 29:57.172
Please, baby.

29:57.213 --> 30:00.425
I-I really need you
to help me out here.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.677
Yeah, baby.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.137
Of course.

30:04.179 --> 30:06.431
(Lee-Curtis panting heavily)

30:13.271 --> 30:15.357
* *

30:17.776 --> 30:20.153
(breath trembles)

30:20.195 --> 30:21.863
(moans)

30:22.697 --> 30:25.950
(moaning)

30:26.785 --> 30:28.912
(muffled moaning)

30:28.953 --> 30:31.206
(moaning loudly)

30:35.502 --> 30:37.587
(panting)

30:37.629 --> 30:39.881
Thank you, God.

30:49.724 --> 30:51.059
Y'all want to know

30:51.101 --> 30:53.520
where God has really blessed me?

30:53.561 --> 30:57.941
Where I'm the richest
and the most prosperous?

30:58.733 --> 31:00.276
Not that I'm not
eternally grateful

31:00.318 --> 31:03.780
for the jets and the cars
and the designer suits.

31:03.822 --> 31:05.156
(congregation laughing)

31:05.198 --> 31:09.035
But where God has really
showed out his blessings

31:09.077 --> 31:10.912
-is in my marriage...
-MAN: Uh-huh.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.080
(applause)

31:12.122 --> 31:14.541
...to my wonderful wife.

31:16.584 --> 31:18.795
Now, I... (clears throat)

31:18.837 --> 31:21.089
I have to be honest.

31:21.131 --> 31:24.384
Marriage is hard.

31:25.593 --> 31:27.220
It's work.

31:27.262 --> 31:30.140
It is the only thing in my life
that I've been blessed with

31:30.181 --> 31:34.477
that requires true energy
to sustain.

31:34.519 --> 31:37.814
But it is, without a shadow
of a doubt, a blessing.

31:37.856 --> 31:39.232
CONGREGATION:
Yes!

31:39.274 --> 31:41.568
Man is made for woman,
woman is made for man,

31:41.609 --> 31:43.278
and it is a beautiful thing.

31:43.319 --> 31:44.821
(congregation murmurs
in agreement)

31:44.863 --> 31:48.616
And it is written
and it's the Word of God.

31:50.118 --> 31:52.287
Now, what is not beautiful

31:52.328 --> 31:54.622
and what is not
made out of God's love

31:54.664 --> 31:57.792
is the homosexual agenda.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.669
(congregation murmurs
in agreement)

31:59.711 --> 32:01.421
It disregards,

32:01.463 --> 32:05.383
it disrespects,
and it devalues the marriage

32:05.425 --> 32:09.137
-I work so hard for every day.
-(applause)

32:09.888 --> 32:12.182
And not just mine.

32:12.223 --> 32:14.851
-Yours.
-(murmuring, applause)

32:14.893 --> 32:16.269
And yours.

32:16.311 --> 32:20.273
And yours. And yours.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.274
And yours.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.693
MAN:
Speak on it, Pastor!

32:24.903 --> 32:28.114
It is man and woman

32:28.156 --> 32:30.325
and marriage.

32:31.159 --> 32:33.286
That is the only way
to prosperity.

32:33.328 --> 32:37.082
And that is the only way
into the kingdom of God.

32:37.123 --> 32:38.375
(congregation murmurs
in agreement)

32:38.416 --> 32:39.959
Take it from me.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.629
I am the prophet
with the beautiful wife

32:42.671 --> 32:44.089
and the gorgeous Bugatti.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.341
-(Trinitie laughs)
-(laughter, applause)

32:48.051 --> 32:50.345
(applause swelling)

32:54.766 --> 32:57.894
-(indistinct chatter)
-(music playing quietly)

32:57.936 --> 33:00.397
(cell phone ringing)

33:02.857 --> 33:04.401
(clears throat)

33:04.442 --> 33:06.569
YVET:
So you just got to get it close

33:06.611 --> 33:09.155
to the scalp,
like as tight as possible.

33:09.197 --> 33:12.909
And then this beauty here
goes on like so.

33:12.951 --> 33:14.369
And voilà. (chuckles)

33:14.411 --> 33:16.246
This the style
the church ladies like to get.

33:16.287 --> 33:17.997
It's got to be slick

33:18.039 --> 33:20.291
and laid to fit
all the adornments on top.

33:20.333 --> 33:22.794
Because if there's one thing
those church ladies love,

33:22.836 --> 33:24.295
it's a good hat.

33:24.337 --> 33:27.298
(over speakers):
* We're gonna be all right... *

33:27.340 --> 33:29.592
(gospel music
continues quietly)

33:31.469 --> 33:33.013
(Trinitie sighs)

33:33.054 --> 33:34.597
Sanctuary!

33:34.639 --> 33:36.725
In the church,
we have this saying:

33:36.766 --> 33:38.601
"Come as you are."

33:38.643 --> 33:41.354
But, you know, that-that's
mostly sentiment, of course.

33:41.396 --> 33:44.065
Sure, you could just,
I guess, roll out of bed

33:44.107 --> 33:46.026
(chuckles):
and come praise the Lord

33:46.067 --> 33:49.237
in your T-shirt and flip-flops,
I guess.

33:49.279 --> 33:51.239
But we also have another saying:

33:51.281 --> 33:53.575
"God don't like ugly."

33:53.616 --> 33:55.577
(chuckling)

33:55.618 --> 33:57.537
Whoo!

33:57.579 --> 33:59.706
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

33:59.748 --> 34:01.082
Do you see this, Anita?

34:01.124 --> 34:04.169
It's like a work of art.
Don't you think?

34:04.210 --> 34:05.879
Oh, my God. What is...

34:05.920 --> 34:07.464
Ooh.

34:07.505 --> 34:09.716
What is this?

34:09.758 --> 34:10.884
Mm.

34:10.925 --> 34:12.260
Come here, Anita.

34:12.302 --> 34:14.054
Go ahead. Touch this.

34:14.095 --> 34:17.807
This is crystal beading
and spider silk.

34:17.849 --> 34:19.142
(sighs)

34:19.184 --> 34:22.062
A combination like this is...

34:22.103 --> 34:25.774
it is holy and sexy all at once.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.359
Imagine.

34:29.444 --> 34:31.613
Wait a minute. (sighs)

34:34.949 --> 34:38.370
Isn't it the most remarkable
thing you've ever seen?

34:39.371 --> 34:41.331
VERA:
The first lady comes in here

34:41.373 --> 34:43.750
a lot these days. Mm-hmm.

34:43.792 --> 34:46.044
It's a rough spot to be in.

34:46.086 --> 34:49.005
But, whoo, these men--

34:49.047 --> 34:50.548
they'll do it to you,
won't they?

34:50.590 --> 34:52.676
Chew you up, spit you out,
and then curse you

34:52.717 --> 34:55.095
for not giving them
enough nutrients.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.721
(sighs)

34:56.763 --> 35:00.600
That woman deserves
every hat in the store.

35:00.642 --> 35:02.686
(indistinct chatter)

35:09.150 --> 35:10.902
* *

35:19.744 --> 35:21.663
Uh... (exhales)

35:21.705 --> 35:23.331
(clears throat)

35:23.373 --> 35:26.459
Would you just, uh...
would you excuse me?

35:26.501 --> 35:27.794
Thank you.

35:27.836 --> 35:31.297
Uh, no, no, no.
Uh, I-I think we're good here.

35:31.339 --> 35:34.175
Okay, we've-we've got...
we've got enough.

35:36.803 --> 35:38.805
Anita... (laughs)

35:38.847 --> 35:41.016
I said we are done.

35:41.057 --> 35:42.475
All right?

35:43.226 --> 35:45.854
God bless. Thank you.

35:47.689 --> 35:49.733
* *

35:49.774 --> 35:51.568
HOST:
Word on the street is that

35:51.609 --> 35:53.361
this Wander to Greater Paths
lawsuit is closing in.

35:53.403 --> 35:55.196
And it's got the streets shook.

35:55.238 --> 35:56.531
What's going on, caller?

35:56.573 --> 35:57.991
MAN:
Yeah, they were young,

35:58.033 --> 35:59.492
but they were adults.

35:59.534 --> 36:01.661
Uh, they agreed to doing
all that shit. Right?

36:01.703 --> 36:03.329
WOMAN:
These niggas was what,

36:03.371 --> 36:05.165
like 18, 19, 20?
That's grown as hell.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.791
This ain't even like that mess

36:06.833 --> 36:08.835
with the priests and stuff
you be hearing about.

36:08.877 --> 36:11.463
Those be actual, factual kids,
you know what I'm saying?

36:11.504 --> 36:13.256
MAN 2:
I don't believe the pastor did

36:13.298 --> 36:14.841
none of that such shit
with them niggas.

36:14.883 --> 36:16.843
Every time a Black man
get some power,

36:16.885 --> 36:19.012
here come folks
trying to tear him down.

36:19.054 --> 36:21.181
It's a damn shame.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.724
WOMAN 2:
Mm. The way I see it,

36:22.766 --> 36:24.309
the first lady is doing
what she needs to do.

36:24.351 --> 36:26.269
That's grown woman stuff
right there.

36:26.311 --> 36:28.855
That lady right there is strong.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.525
(no audio)

36:47.248 --> 36:48.708
(sighs)

36:48.750 --> 36:50.293
Y'all waited for me?

36:50.335 --> 36:53.004
I thought I said
you could just...

36:53.046 --> 36:54.506
You know what? It's fine.

36:54.547 --> 36:56.216
I just had to finish
some last-minute shopping--

36:56.257 --> 36:58.677
girl stuff-- and I just did not
think that you all would even

36:58.718 --> 37:01.137
-be interested, so I...
-First Lady?

37:01.179 --> 37:03.098
First Lady.

37:03.139 --> 37:05.392
Sister Denetta.

37:05.433 --> 37:06.893
(both chuckle)

37:06.935 --> 37:08.019
How are you?

37:08.061 --> 37:09.896
Oh, look at you.

37:09.938 --> 37:11.106
Look at you.

37:11.147 --> 37:12.065
(both chuckle)

37:12.107 --> 37:13.775
Oh, bless your heart.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.071
Look at you. (chuckles)

37:18.113 --> 37:19.989
And bless, also, your own heart.

37:20.031 --> 37:22.450
And they are?

37:23.952 --> 37:25.578
Oh, well, we're just

37:25.620 --> 37:28.081
documenting this time
in our lives.

37:28.123 --> 37:29.666
Me and Lee-Curtis, obviously,

37:29.708 --> 37:32.085
with, uh, you know,
building our church back up

37:32.127 --> 37:36.256
and working towards our
first service back this Easter.

37:36.297 --> 37:39.217
-Easter, you say?
-Mm-hmm.

37:39.259 --> 37:41.720
That's so crazy. (laughs)

37:41.761 --> 37:44.097
You know that's when
the Sumpters are opening up

37:44.139 --> 37:47.308
their new Heaven's House
location, right?

37:47.350 --> 37:49.310
-The Sumpters?
-Mm-hmm.

37:49.352 --> 37:51.104
-Really?
-Mm.

37:51.146 --> 37:53.982
-This Easter?
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

37:54.816 --> 37:57.110
Of course,
this might make things

37:57.152 --> 37:59.779
a little more complicated
for y'all.

37:59.821 --> 38:01.614
(Denetta laughs)

38:01.656 --> 38:02.782
(laughs)

38:02.824 --> 38:05.368
Well, anyway,
you just keep on praying.

38:05.410 --> 38:08.705
And I'm sure
plenty of the old congregation

38:08.747 --> 38:10.290
will come right on back through

38:10.331 --> 38:12.125
good old
Wander to Greater Paths' doors.

38:12.167 --> 38:13.376
Well, that is for sure.

38:13.418 --> 38:16.338
I know they will. Yes.

38:17.339 --> 38:19.716
But you won't, though.

38:19.758 --> 38:22.469
Right? You and your family?

38:22.510 --> 38:24.637
Word is that y'all done...

38:24.679 --> 38:29.059
y'all done went and got
yourselves a new church home.

38:33.855 --> 38:35.482
(Denetta chuckles)

38:35.523 --> 38:39.986
Oh, well, sweetie, I had to.

38:40.028 --> 38:44.741
You know I do career counseling
at the community college.

38:44.783 --> 38:47.994
-Mm.
-It just wouldn't look right.

38:48.036 --> 38:51.039
You understand.

38:51.081 --> 38:53.875
-Hmm? (chuckles)
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.126
No, I understand.

38:55.168 --> 38:57.420
Of course I understand.

38:57.462 --> 38:58.713
But prayers up for y'all.

38:58.755 --> 39:00.173
-(playfully): Prayers up.
-(both laugh)

39:00.215 --> 39:02.384
-You so hood.
-I keep it real.

39:02.425 --> 39:05.512
No, look. Ghetto thing.

39:05.553 --> 39:08.765
(both laughing)

39:12.560 --> 39:14.813
(both sighing)

39:17.732 --> 39:19.359
Well, I got to get going.

39:19.401 --> 39:21.486
-You have a blessed one.
-Oh, my goodness.

39:21.528 --> 39:23.947
-And you have a blessed...
-Okay.

39:34.040 --> 39:37.711
Look, you don't get to pick
how the devil torments you.

39:37.752 --> 39:39.963
You see what I'm saying?

39:41.923 --> 39:44.551
Now, I volunteered
for this, right?

39:44.592 --> 39:47.971
I chose for y'all
to come down here to truly see

39:48.013 --> 39:51.057
and to show the world
what I'm really about.

39:51.099 --> 39:55.020
And I promise to God,
this is who I am.

39:56.104 --> 39:57.480
You know?

40:02.444 --> 40:04.863
I did not hurt anybody.

40:04.904 --> 40:06.072
No, no, no, no.

40:06.114 --> 40:10.577
Hurt? Nobody was hurt
with me or by me.

40:10.618 --> 40:14.414
If anything,
I was too warm, okay?

40:14.456 --> 40:16.708
Was too generous.

40:20.045 --> 40:22.630
You know, part of this whole
thing that I remain proud of--

40:22.672 --> 40:24.591
and I will not budge on this--

40:24.632 --> 40:26.843
is that I did mentor
those individuals

40:26.885 --> 40:30.513
who are all now
so, uh, bothered.

40:30.555 --> 40:35.393
I was a light and
a guiding force in their lives.

40:35.435 --> 40:37.771
That's all that was.

40:37.812 --> 40:40.523
It was me being a giver.

40:40.565 --> 40:42.025
I'm a sinner.

40:42.067 --> 40:44.986
Okay?
Like any other human being.

40:45.028 --> 40:47.113
But, uh... (laughing)

40:49.407 --> 40:53.453
I'm no, uh... pervert.

40:53.495 --> 40:54.954
(chuckles)

40:54.996 --> 40:57.874
I'm no criminal.

40:57.916 --> 40:59.125
A sinner, yes.

40:59.167 --> 41:02.128
But all that other
horrible, awful stuff? No.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.547
You can check the facts on that.

41:04.589 --> 41:07.300
I am not a criminal.

41:07.342 --> 41:09.094
That's not me.

41:11.221 --> 41:13.515
(phone ringing)

41:13.556 --> 41:14.974
I, uh... (clears throat)

41:15.016 --> 41:16.851
Just one moment.

41:17.727 --> 41:19.020
This is Lee-Curtis Childs,

41:19.062 --> 41:21.856
pastor of Wander
to Greater Paths Baptist.

41:23.191 --> 41:25.527
Sh... Uh, yeah.

41:25.568 --> 41:27.862
Gary, yeah, we can,
we can discuss it now.

41:27.904 --> 41:29.614
Anita, I'm gonna need y'all
to give me

41:29.656 --> 41:31.366
a little bit of privacy
here for a sec.

41:31.408 --> 41:33.410
(grunts softly)

41:33.451 --> 41:35.704
Just one sec, Gary.

41:37.372 --> 41:40.041
(sighs) Lee-Curtis, we need
to chat about something.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.752
Uh, Anita, can you,
can you guys give us the room?

41:42.794 --> 41:45.171
-Uh, they're already
on their way out. -Good.

41:45.213 --> 41:48.174
-Uh, and I got Gary on the
line, so... -Oh, good, good.

41:48.216 --> 41:50.760
Um, can you hold on
one sec there, Gary.

41:50.802 --> 41:52.846
(quietly):
What is that?

41:52.887 --> 41:54.514
That. What is, what is that?

41:54.556 --> 41:57.017
Oh, you've never seen
a church hat before?

41:57.058 --> 41:58.935
-(sighs) Yeah.
-No, I just picked it up.

41:58.977 --> 42:01.521
I thought it might be nice
for our first Sunday.

42:01.563 --> 42:04.482
For somebody's
great-aunt Thomasina maybe.

42:04.524 --> 42:05.692
I mean, come on, baby.

42:05.734 --> 42:08.611
That is so not our style,
you know?

42:08.653 --> 42:13.199
You gonna make us both
look... ol-old.

42:18.079 --> 42:20.165
-(sighs)
-Right?

42:20.206 --> 42:22.792
(both laugh)

42:23.877 --> 42:26.546
Hey, there's my beautiful girl.

42:26.588 --> 42:28.048
Uh, hey, Gary, I got, uh,

42:28.089 --> 42:30.050
Trinitie here, too, now
if that's better.

42:30.091 --> 42:32.552
So, uh, so, um-- Did you need
to say something to me?

42:32.594 --> 42:34.554
Uh, uh, uh...

42:34.596 --> 42:38.641
N-Not-not important right now.
Hmm.

42:38.683 --> 42:40.560
All right.

42:40.602 --> 42:42.228
Uh, so, uh, Anita,

42:42.270 --> 42:45.732
I'm gonna need y'all
to skedaddle now, okay?

42:45.774 --> 42:47.567
Thank you. (clears throat)

42:47.609 --> 42:49.778
One second.

42:54.199 --> 42:55.658
TRINITIE:
Uh-huh.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.243
Yeah, Gary, we're both on.

42:57.285 --> 42:59.454
-Mm-hmm. -They don't know
how to act around it,

42:59.496 --> 43:00.538
-you know what I'm saying?
-Mm.

43:00.580 --> 43:01.706
TRINITIE:
Oh, well,

43:01.748 --> 43:03.416
that's promising.

43:03.458 --> 43:07.921
And-and what all do we owe,
to tie everything up nice and...

43:07.962 --> 43:10.715
-Can you zoom? Can you...
-It says, "Stay humble."

43:10.757 --> 43:12.092
LEE-CURTIS:
Now, wait just a minute.

43:12.133 --> 43:15.679
We've already shelled out...
(sighs)

43:16.471 --> 43:17.889
This is strong-arm robbery.

43:17.931 --> 43:20.058
I don't want
to shell out another...

43:20.809 --> 43:23.561
Jesus fucking Christ!

43:23.603 --> 43:25.271
TRINITIE:
Uh, let-let's not use

43:25.313 --> 43:26.606
that language, Gary.

43:26.648 --> 43:28.942
Not here. Okay?
These were not boys.

43:28.983 --> 43:33.196
These were a group of adults
that made consenting decisions.

43:33.238 --> 43:35.949
And you make sure that
that is in the paperwork, too.

43:35.990 --> 43:37.283
Okay?

43:38.159 --> 43:39.536
LEE-CURTIS (on TV):
These folks are overcome

43:39.577 --> 43:41.329
by demonic spirits.

43:41.371 --> 43:44.040
And they're trying to make
their ways into your lives,

43:44.082 --> 43:48.169
-one evil step at a time.
-(applause)

43:50.213 --> 43:52.799
Hold on, now.
You've only mentioned four.

43:52.841 --> 43:56.344
So, wait, who's the,
who's-who's the holdout?

43:57.470 --> 43:59.097
Just Khalil?

44:00.098 --> 44:03.476
Well, if he won't take it,
then he won't take it.

44:03.518 --> 44:05.145
TRINITIE:
(sighs) All right, Gary.

44:05.186 --> 44:06.813
Let's just do it.

44:06.855 --> 44:09.983
Yes, yes, whatever
the amount is, we'll handle it.

44:10.025 --> 44:13.862
We just can't have this burden
on us anymore, on our church.

44:13.903 --> 44:18.950
For the love of God, let's
just do what we have to do.

44:21.327 --> 44:24.497
* 'Kay, I just called a play,
I just called a play... *

44:24.539 --> 44:26.124
VERLENZO:
Oh, hell yeah.

44:26.166 --> 44:28.793
Ball is everything, man.
Everything.

44:28.835 --> 44:30.962
Since I learned
how to walk, on God.

44:31.004 --> 44:33.089
And, you know,
being from around here,

44:33.131 --> 44:36.259
man, all the leagues
started off in the churches.

44:36.301 --> 44:39.346
Man, I shot my first three
on Wander to Greater Paths.

44:39.387 --> 44:41.264
The courts are beautiful, man.

44:41.306 --> 44:42.766
(scoffs)

44:42.807 --> 44:44.559
I used to hit 'em up
just to shoot around and stuff

44:44.601 --> 44:47.187
on the weekends
when I went home.

44:48.104 --> 44:51.941
Now... now I got
to find somewhere else to go.

44:51.983 --> 44:55.028
LEE-CURTIS:
So you enjoying your time here?

44:55.070 --> 44:56.696
I mean, working with Anita
and the film

44:56.738 --> 44:58.031
and doing the whole sound thing?

44:58.073 --> 44:59.532
BASIL:
Yeah, it's solid.

44:59.574 --> 45:02.118
You get to go to new places,
meet interesting people.

45:02.160 --> 45:04.579
LEE-CURTIS: Interesting people.
Yeah, I bet.

45:04.621 --> 45:07.457
BASIL: Okay, all off. Whew.
That was a lot of tape.

45:07.499 --> 45:09.668
LEE-CURTIS: Oh, boy.
Thanks for meeting me in here.

45:09.709 --> 45:12.253
I get a little shy doing this
in front of the whole crew.

45:12.295 --> 45:14.297
BASIL:
Ah, it's all good. All good.

45:14.339 --> 45:18.718
LEE-CURTIS: Oh, uh, by the way,
I know I got a bit sensitive

45:18.760 --> 45:21.554
the other day when
I kicked y'all out of there.

45:21.596 --> 45:23.056
Um...

45:23.098 --> 45:24.641
And I know
it's all about to come out

45:24.683 --> 45:25.934
and Trin is gonna
want to kill me

45:25.975 --> 45:29.062
for telling too soon, but, uh...

45:29.104 --> 45:30.689
it's over.

45:30.730 --> 45:32.732
I'm good.

45:32.774 --> 45:34.067
BASIL:
I'm sorry. I don't, I don't...

45:34.109 --> 45:36.444
LEE-CURTIS:
Well, we, uh...

45:36.486 --> 45:38.405
we-we've settled.

45:38.446 --> 45:40.907
That's what that whole
phone call was about.

45:40.949 --> 45:44.536
Uh, all parties
came to an agreement,

45:44.577 --> 45:47.455
and, uh, that's it.

45:47.497 --> 45:48.915
You know?

45:48.957 --> 45:51.501
Put all that, uh,
rah-rah stuff to bed,

45:51.543 --> 45:54.212
and, well, that's all she wrote.

45:54.254 --> 45:55.755
I'm free.

45:55.797 --> 45:58.091
The war is won.

45:58.133 --> 46:01.094
BASIL:
Wow. That's...

46:01.136 --> 46:03.430
that's g...
that's good for you.

46:03.471 --> 46:05.932
LEE-CURTIS:
Yeah. Thank you.

46:07.017 --> 46:09.477
Wait, hold-hold on for a second.

46:09.519 --> 46:12.022
(groans)

46:12.063 --> 46:14.315
(exhaling rhythmically)

46:15.817 --> 46:17.360
(sighs)

46:20.905 --> 46:23.158
(grunting playfully)

46:24.159 --> 46:27.120
How much you want to put
on this first shot?

46:27.162 --> 46:29.122
-Hmm?
-(chuckles)

46:30.749 --> 46:33.168
Oh!

46:33.209 --> 46:34.461
Man.

46:34.502 --> 46:36.338
(basketball bouncing)

46:36.379 --> 46:38.423
All right.

46:38.465 --> 46:39.966
-Whoo!
-Oh.

46:40.008 --> 46:41.634
-Oh, nah, nah.
-(laughing)

46:41.676 --> 46:43.303
Nah, I'm no good. I'm no good.

46:43.345 --> 46:44.596
-(chuckles)
-All right. All right.

46:44.637 --> 46:46.848
Well, rebound me, then.

46:46.890 --> 46:48.808
(sighs)

46:48.850 --> 46:50.477
-(net swooshes)
-There we go.

46:50.518 --> 46:52.812
Cool job you got, man.

46:52.854 --> 46:54.647
Working on a movie like this.

46:54.689 --> 46:56.858
It's gonna be big, you know?

46:57.692 --> 46:59.527
-(rim clanks)
-Uh...

46:59.569 --> 47:01.071
Should be cool. Yeah.

47:01.112 --> 47:04.115
Yeah. You're a lucky young man.

47:04.157 --> 47:07.035
It's a phenomenal opportunity.

47:07.077 --> 47:09.412
How old you got to be
to get a gig like this?

47:09.454 --> 47:12.165
At least 19, 20 years old,
I'm thinking.

47:12.207 --> 47:13.833
-I mean, yeah, probably.
-Yeah.

47:13.875 --> 47:15.627
I'm 26.

47:15.669 --> 47:17.921
Really, now?

47:17.962 --> 47:20.382
Huh. (grunts)

47:20.423 --> 47:22.967
Hey, you know what I do
to stay looking fresh?

47:23.009 --> 47:25.261
Strict shaving regimen.

47:25.303 --> 47:27.347
-Yes, sir.
-(net swooshes)

47:27.389 --> 47:29.974
I take off five years
when I trim up these whiskers.

47:30.016 --> 47:32.894
Eight if my moisturizing
routine is tip-top.

47:32.936 --> 47:34.979
Put you on game, son.

47:35.021 --> 47:36.731
That's important
in your industry, isn't it?

47:36.773 --> 47:39.067
-The air of youth.
-(net swooshes)

47:39.943 --> 47:42.570
Uh, not really
on my side of things.

47:45.365 --> 47:46.741
Yeah.

47:46.783 --> 47:49.202
I could definitely put you on.

47:49.244 --> 47:52.205
Hey, say,
when this movie is done

47:52.247 --> 47:53.873
and the church is
back and booming,

47:53.915 --> 47:58.044
you should come and do sound
for our audiovisual department.

47:58.086 --> 48:00.046
That'd be real nice,
wouldn't it?

48:00.088 --> 48:01.631
And then after that,

48:01.673 --> 48:04.092
well, I-I know a lot of folks
in the industry.

48:04.134 --> 48:06.553
I can make some calls.
Just for you, though.

48:06.594 --> 48:09.889
I don't ordinarily do
that sort of thing.

48:09.931 --> 48:11.558
Oh, that should...

48:11.599 --> 48:14.936
that, you know,
that could be... cool.

48:14.978 --> 48:18.398
Cool? Cool. Cool. (chuckles)

48:20.608 --> 48:22.777
Mm.

48:22.819 --> 48:25.030
So much scruff.

48:27.282 --> 48:29.617
My boyfriend digs it, so...

48:34.622 --> 48:36.458
Well, we can't convert them all.

48:36.499 --> 48:37.917
Ain't that right?

48:37.959 --> 48:39.502
(chuckles)

48:43.798 --> 48:46.092
Just getting off the mics.

48:47.177 --> 48:49.554
I'm-I'm just--
I'm-a, I'm-a pack up my kit.

48:49.596 --> 48:51.139
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

48:53.308 --> 48:55.769
It's good talking to you,
young man.

48:55.810 --> 48:59.189
You let me know if I can do
anything for you, okay?

49:19.000 --> 49:21.503
-(breathes deeply)
-Hey.

49:30.970 --> 49:32.931
Did you give him anything?

49:32.972 --> 49:34.891
What?

49:34.933 --> 49:36.518
No, I just offered
to help him with...

49:36.559 --> 49:39.020
We just got robbed for
an obscene amount of money,

49:39.062 --> 49:40.355
all for this to go away,

49:40.397 --> 49:42.649
so we can't afford
for you to go back

49:42.691 --> 49:46.069
to being your generous self
with people.

49:46.111 --> 49:48.655
My God, we need peace,

49:48.697 --> 49:52.992
so you can get back
in that pulpit and preaching...

49:53.034 --> 49:56.037
and get me back on that stage.

49:58.790 --> 50:00.250
(Trinitie sighs)

50:01.710 --> 50:05.505
Heaven's House is
opening its doors Easter.

50:05.547 --> 50:07.590
Same as us.

50:07.632 --> 50:09.300
What?

50:10.093 --> 50:12.512
How do-- uh, who says?

50:12.554 --> 50:14.180
Uh...

50:14.222 --> 50:16.933
Is this what you were trying
to tell me before

50:16.975 --> 50:19.227
at the office when...?

50:20.812 --> 50:23.023
Because surely you wouldn't
have kept something

50:23.064 --> 50:24.399
like this from me.

50:26.443 --> 50:27.694
Yeah?

50:32.907 --> 50:35.702
Yeah. (chuckles softly)

50:35.744 --> 50:37.746
I just found out myself today

50:37.787 --> 50:39.622
when I, when I... (sighs)

50:39.664 --> 50:42.459
I booked my hair appointment
with Yvet.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.044
-You know, that Yvet...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

50:44.085 --> 50:45.128
I mean, sh-she knows
everyone's business,

50:45.170 --> 50:46.713
-and that's how I...
-Yeah.

50:49.674 --> 50:51.259
Fuck!

50:52.302 --> 50:54.804
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

50:57.599 --> 50:59.601
(yells furiously)

51:10.028 --> 51:12.447
-Got it all out?
-Yup.

51:14.532 --> 51:16.743
Okay.

51:16.785 --> 51:18.870
Well, good.

51:20.288 --> 51:21.873
Let's go for a ride.

51:21.915 --> 51:24.167
(music playing quietly)

51:29.547 --> 51:33.093
KEON: Okay, Mr. and Mrs.
Sullivan, you can come on in.

51:33.134 --> 51:36.388
Oh, uh, Pastor Childs.
First Lady.

51:36.429 --> 51:38.056
We were hoping
you might have a moment.

51:38.098 --> 51:39.391
Well, I'm afraid we have

51:39.432 --> 51:42.227
a slew of
marriage counseling sessions.

51:42.268 --> 51:43.770
Oh, we won't be long, I'm sure.

51:43.812 --> 51:46.523
And as for this lovely couple,
(chuckles)

51:46.564 --> 51:48.733
they already look like
forever to me.

51:48.775 --> 51:50.318
Yes, they do.

51:51.069 --> 51:52.946
Well, this is unexpected.

51:52.987 --> 51:57.283
This is a pleasant surprise,
but it's unexpected.

51:57.325 --> 51:59.285
-It's a big commitment,
marriage... -Yeah.

51:59.327 --> 52:00.829
SHAKURA:
...but, um...

52:00.870 --> 52:03.164
it always starts with
having God at the center.

52:03.206 --> 52:04.499
That's how it lasts.

52:04.541 --> 52:05.875
-Mm-hmm. -Right?
-LEE-CURTIS: I'm sorry.

52:05.917 --> 52:07.252
-What's-what's that, now?
-Uh...

52:07.293 --> 52:08.670
KEON: You did come
for marriage counseling?

52:08.712 --> 52:11.756
-We typically do newlyweds
or newly engaged. -Yeah.

52:11.798 --> 52:14.009
But every so often,
we get a seasoned couple.

52:14.050 --> 52:15.176
-Sure.
-(Trinitie laughing)

52:15.218 --> 52:17.137
No, that's not... (laughs)

52:17.178 --> 52:19.806
-We don't, we don't need
counseling. Right? -Yes.

52:19.848 --> 52:21.975
-Oh, God. Yes. Yes. -We counsel
plenty of folks ourselves,

52:22.017 --> 52:23.643
-and believe me, uh,
-(laughing)

52:23.685 --> 52:25.645
we're not the kind of marriage
that's in need, so...

52:25.687 --> 52:28.231
-TRINITIE: Not at all.
-I see.

52:28.273 --> 52:30.191
Then what can we do for you?

52:30.233 --> 52:32.902
Well, Pastor Sumpter
and Pastor Sumpter.

52:32.944 --> 52:34.362
(laughter)

52:34.404 --> 52:36.197
No, it's your opening date
for your new location,

52:36.239 --> 52:37.532
which is great, by the way.

52:37.574 --> 52:38.992
-(whistles)
-Oh, it's so nice.

52:39.034 --> 52:41.244
-Amen.
-We love it. (laughs)

52:41.286 --> 52:42.829
I mean, don't get me wrong.

52:42.871 --> 52:45.165
-This place is where we
got started. -SHAKURA: Mm-hmm.

52:45.206 --> 52:47.167
KEON:
But Heaven House 2.0, ooh--

52:47.208 --> 52:49.377
-it's gonna be amazing.
-TRINITIE: Oh, I bet.

52:49.419 --> 52:50.670
-(laughing)
-Ah, I bet.

52:50.712 --> 52:52.630
And I am sure
that the Lord is gonna be

52:52.672 --> 52:54.758
-coursing right on up through
there when you open. -Oh, yeah.

52:54.799 --> 52:57.010
It's just that... (sighs)

52:57.052 --> 52:59.095
well, it can't be the fourth.

52:59.137 --> 53:00.805
One more time, now.

53:00.847 --> 53:03.308
LEE-CURTIS: Uh, she's saying
you-you can't open up.

53:03.350 --> 53:04.726
Not-not this Easter. All right?

53:04.768 --> 53:06.478
-It-it doesn't work.
-Yes, exact--

53:06.519 --> 53:09.689
-Thank you, honey. Thank you.
-Oh. Well, I...

53:09.731 --> 53:12.359
I just don't see
how that's possible.

53:14.486 --> 53:16.571
-Well, surely it's possible.
-Yes. Yes.

53:16.613 --> 53:18.907
All-all things are possible
with God.

53:18.948 --> 53:21.576
-That-That's Matthew 19:26.
-Come on, now. Yes, it is.

53:21.618 --> 53:23.703
No. (chuckles)
I don't think it is.

53:23.745 --> 53:28.166
See, uh... we've been
preparing for this day for

53:28.208 --> 53:30.293
-like a year now.
-Mm-hmm. Amen.

53:30.335 --> 53:32.504
KEON:
It's a big step for us.

53:32.545 --> 53:34.714
And, you know,
Easter is so perfect

53:34.756 --> 53:36.633
-for something like this.
-(chuckles)

53:36.675 --> 53:39.052
-A revival of sorts.
-TRINITIE: Right.

53:39.094 --> 53:40.637
Exactly.

53:40.679 --> 53:43.723
And that is just what
Wander to Greater Paths needs.

53:43.765 --> 53:44.808
A revival.

53:44.849 --> 53:48.061
Uh, which is why
we also chose Easter.

53:48.103 --> 53:49.521
-We did.
-You see?

53:49.562 --> 53:52.565
And we chose that date
a while back, believe me.

53:52.607 --> 53:55.902
So, really, it just comes down
to this point.

53:55.944 --> 53:57.529
Um...

53:58.738 --> 54:02.117
We cannot both reopen
our churches on Easter Sunday.

54:02.158 --> 54:03.952
It would be, well, it would be

54:03.993 --> 54:07.247
-too confusing for folks,
you know? -Mm-hmm. Yeah.

54:07.288 --> 54:10.583
They would have to choose,
and, well...

54:10.625 --> 54:12.085
Right.

54:12.127 --> 54:14.963
They'll make their choice,
I think.

54:17.424 --> 54:20.719
KEON:
Look, uh, we adore y'all.

54:20.760 --> 54:22.595
Really.

54:22.637 --> 54:25.557
We used to be
congregation members at WTGP.

54:25.598 --> 54:26.641
Right.

54:26.683 --> 54:28.435
Until we struck out on our own.

54:28.476 --> 54:30.270
Uh, it's just...

54:30.311 --> 54:32.022
We belong here.

54:32.063 --> 54:35.525
We believe in the Gospel,
and we believe in the Word

54:35.567 --> 54:37.694
and all the hard work
that we've done

54:37.736 --> 54:39.446
-to get to this place...
-KEON: Mm-hmm. Mm.

54:39.487 --> 54:42.449
...where enough, uh,
enough people will hear us

54:42.490 --> 54:43.950
for it to make a difference.

54:43.992 --> 54:45.285
That's all we've ever wanted.

54:45.326 --> 54:49.497
So we can't do
what y'all are asking.

54:49.539 --> 54:52.876
-What we can do is pray.
-Mm.

54:52.917 --> 54:56.629
-That there are enough souls to
go around for all of us. -Amen.

54:58.381 --> 55:00.300
Y'all want to pray?

55:00.342 --> 55:01.718
We got two gathered right here.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.219
-We are okay.
-Right, y'all.

55:03.261 --> 55:04.137
-Y'all start it off.
-Yeah, you all.

55:04.179 --> 55:06.931
Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay.

55:06.973 --> 55:08.475
All right.

55:09.225 --> 55:10.685
-Heavenly Father...
-Mm.

55:10.727 --> 55:12.479
...we thank you for this space
to come together

55:12.520 --> 55:15.857
-and build and heal
this community, Lord. -Amen.

55:15.899 --> 55:17.776
SHAKURA:
We thank you for the grace

55:17.817 --> 55:20.153
of these beautiful,
powerful leaders

55:20.195 --> 55:21.738
coming in
and showing us the way,

55:21.780 --> 55:25.200
-being role models in
your mighty name, Lord. -Mm.

55:25.241 --> 55:27.160
-KEON: * Oh, Lord. *
-Hallelujah. Mm.

55:27.202 --> 55:29.454
(gentle music playing quietly)

55:30.455 --> 55:34.834
So, hey, we-we figure
something else out.

55:34.876 --> 55:37.337
You know, we just--
we push forward.

55:37.379 --> 55:38.880
Fuck the Sumpters.

55:38.922 --> 55:42.676
I mean, bless them in
the work they do, but really.

55:44.469 --> 55:45.845
Did you hear me?

55:45.887 --> 55:48.723
-I said, we...
-Right. Right. Yeah. No.

55:48.765 --> 55:51.059
Uh, baby, I heard you. (snorts)

55:51.101 --> 55:53.019
So I been thinking.

55:53.061 --> 55:54.979
We do what we do best.

55:55.021 --> 55:56.398
We outdo them.

55:56.439 --> 55:58.191
We put on a show so good

55:58.233 --> 56:00.402
-folks won't think twice
about another church. -Mm-hmm.

56:00.443 --> 56:02.946
-Yeah. -They opening
this Easter Sunday.

56:02.987 --> 56:03.947
Right?

56:03.988 --> 56:05.907
So it's like you said.

56:05.949 --> 56:07.534
Fuck 'em.

56:07.575 --> 56:10.036
They just doing it to spite us.
I know it. You know it.

56:10.078 --> 56:12.706
But there's no spiting us, baby.

56:12.747 --> 56:13.790
Okay?

56:13.832 --> 56:16.459
Easter is in
just under two weeks.

56:16.501 --> 56:22.048
So, we reopen
this Sunday instead.

56:22.090 --> 56:23.091
(pops lips)

56:26.720 --> 56:28.930
-Wait. This Sunday?
-This Sunday.

56:28.972 --> 56:31.224
No. But, baby, we can't--
we not-- we won't be ready.

56:31.266 --> 56:32.851
-But this Sunday, we should...
-Now, think about it, baby.

56:32.892 --> 56:35.562
Now is the perfect time
to come back.

56:35.603 --> 56:38.189
See, everybody is
expecting Easter, right?

56:38.231 --> 56:39.566
It's when Jesus rose again.

56:39.607 --> 56:41.067
But if you think back
to those times,

56:41.109 --> 56:44.696
nobody knew when he was coming,
if at all.

56:44.738 --> 56:47.449
This is what it's really like
to embody the Lord

56:47.490 --> 56:48.950
and walk in his image.

56:48.992 --> 56:51.494
Jesus Christ was all about
the shock factor!

56:51.536 --> 56:53.371
(stammers) Okay, listen, no.

56:53.413 --> 56:54.497
-Yes.
-All right?

56:54.539 --> 56:55.999
Listen, this is too much.

56:56.041 --> 56:58.251
There would be so much to do
in just a few short days.

56:58.293 --> 56:59.794
We-we-- No, no, no, we cannot.

56:59.836 --> 57:02.005
It's Pastor
and Pastor Sumpter, Trin.

57:02.047 --> 57:04.466
We can't compete
with a gimmick like that.

57:04.507 --> 57:06.593
The Sumpters are snatching up
all our members,

57:06.634 --> 57:09.137
and we need to do something
major to get them back.

57:09.179 --> 57:10.513
And we can do it, baby.

57:10.555 --> 57:13.266
We just got to make
a big enough fuss, right?

57:13.308 --> 57:17.103
Pull out the pageantry,
really dramatize our return.

57:17.145 --> 57:20.523
We gonna make a scene,
and it's gonna be so brilliant,

57:20.565 --> 57:23.610
so seductive,

57:23.651 --> 57:25.278
people gonna come.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.364
They gonna come right on back.

57:27.405 --> 57:28.531
Hey, look at me.

57:28.573 --> 57:30.617
Look at me, Trin. Hey.

57:30.658 --> 57:34.746
God built this whole world
in six days.

57:34.788 --> 57:37.290
This whole big beautiful world,
all right?

57:37.332 --> 57:38.958
Now, call me overzealous,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.128
but I think
I can rebuild ours in five.

57:42.170 --> 57:43.588
(growls)

57:44.339 --> 57:46.716
Wait. Lee-Curtis.

57:46.758 --> 57:50.387
Wait. Lee-Curtis,
just listen to me, please.

57:50.428 --> 57:51.930
-Lee...
-Come on!

57:51.971 --> 57:55.684
-* Tear it down *
-* We can make it *

57:55.725 --> 57:57.060
* Start over again *

57:57.102 --> 57:59.020
* We can make it *

57:59.062 --> 58:01.147
* We can make
a brand-new start *

58:01.189 --> 58:04.901
* Start over again... *

58:04.943 --> 58:06.486
(song fades)

58:06.528 --> 58:08.488
TRINITIE:
We went all in for this one.

58:08.530 --> 58:10.281
(laughs)

58:10.323 --> 58:13.702
Lee-Curtis was blessed
with the most brilliant idea.

58:13.743 --> 58:15.328
A roadside ministry.

58:15.370 --> 58:17.497
Wander to Greater Paths
opens back this Sunday!

58:17.539 --> 58:19.499
Yeah! This Sunday!

58:19.541 --> 58:21.001
TRINITIE:
Now, this is the best way

58:21.042 --> 58:22.669
to gain followers.

58:22.711 --> 58:26.131
You know, our style is-is...
is more, uh, grassroots,

58:26.172 --> 58:27.924
more genuine.

58:29.175 --> 58:31.553
Folks out here-- we do
this sort of thing all the time

58:31.594 --> 58:33.013
in the name of God.

58:33.054 --> 58:35.015
It's good. It's--
The more beeps the better.

58:35.056 --> 58:37.809
It just, it just draws
attention to a worthy cause.

58:37.851 --> 58:39.853
-And I cannot think of a cause
-(horn honks)

58:39.894 --> 58:42.022
-more worthy than this right
here. -LEE-CURTIS: Hey, Trin!

58:42.063 --> 58:45.316
-Huh? -You ain't really
getting that many beeps, baby.

58:45.358 --> 58:46.568
Huh?

58:46.609 --> 58:48.570
-What you doing?
-What did you say to me?

58:48.611 --> 58:50.113
You gonna have to do
a little more.

58:50.155 --> 58:52.866
Give them a show!
You know, come on, girl!

58:52.907 --> 58:56.077
-Uh...
-Shake it for the Lord.

58:56.119 --> 58:57.954
Shake it for the Lord.

58:57.996 --> 59:00.123
-I said, get it for the Lord!
-Yeah. Yeah.

59:00.165 --> 59:03.209
-Get them honks for the Lord!
-Yeah! Yeah! -(horn honks)

59:03.251 --> 59:06.212
Tap it on the patch!

59:06.254 --> 59:07.505
Shake it for the Lord, girl.

59:07.547 --> 59:08.965
Come on, now!

59:09.007 --> 59:11.426
Shake it for the Lord, girl.

59:11.468 --> 59:13.386
Mm. Shake it.

59:13.428 --> 59:15.096
Hey!

59:15.138 --> 59:18.224
You having
a blessed day, sweetie?

59:18.266 --> 59:19.851
Huh?

59:19.893 --> 59:22.604
Well, come on down
to Wander to Greater Paths.

59:22.645 --> 59:25.482
We are back in action
this Sunday!

59:25.523 --> 59:27.734
And it is gonna be amazing!

59:27.776 --> 59:29.402
I can guarantee it!

59:29.444 --> 59:31.363
(horn honking)

59:31.404 --> 59:33.656
* *

59:47.045 --> 59:49.130
(horn honking)

59:57.889 --> 59:59.849
LEE-CURTIS:
The spirit of the Lord

59:59.891 --> 1:00:02.435
is upon my heart,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:00:02.477 --> 1:00:04.020
And that's what we are.

1:00:04.062 --> 1:00:07.774
We are unique emanations
of love, joy and divine beauty.

1:00:07.816 --> 1:00:10.110
-(horns honking) -Praise him!
-Heavenly Father, allow me

1:00:10.151 --> 1:00:11.778
to minister these people
in the way

1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:13.363
-in which they need to be.
-Yes, Lord!

1:00:13.405 --> 1:00:14.572
(Lee-Curtis speaking in tongues)

1:00:14.614 --> 1:00:16.116
TRINITIE:
Hmm. Uh, the settlement.

1:00:16.157 --> 1:00:18.618
I'm not sure
that I can address that.

1:00:18.660 --> 1:00:21.871
Uh, that's a bit difficult
for us, legally.

1:00:21.913 --> 1:00:25.125
But that's all over
and done with, so...

1:00:26.376 --> 1:00:29.462
Okay, okay, but, um... (laughs)

1:00:29.504 --> 1:00:32.257
you want to hear about
something really difficult?

1:00:32.298 --> 1:00:33.675
Okay, so get this.

1:00:33.717 --> 1:00:36.469
Um, did you know that, uh...

1:00:36.511 --> 1:00:37.804
(laughs)

1:00:37.846 --> 1:00:39.806
...when we first started
going together,

1:00:39.848 --> 1:00:43.852
Lee-Curtis was Baptist
and I was Apostolic?

1:00:46.021 --> 1:00:48.148
(laughs):
And that's true.

1:00:48.189 --> 1:00:49.566
Honk for the Lord!

1:00:49.607 --> 1:00:52.485
So, yeah, we, um,
we know discomfort, believe me.

1:00:52.527 --> 1:00:54.529
-A little roadside spectacle?
-(both continue shouting)

1:00:54.571 --> 1:00:55.822
It's nothing.

1:00:55.864 --> 1:00:57.657
Yeah, we make it work.

1:00:57.699 --> 1:00:59.325
Dynamic duo.

1:00:59.367 --> 1:01:01.244
(laughs)

1:01:01.286 --> 1:01:03.747
Yep. Batman and--

1:01:03.788 --> 1:01:07.334
Oh, no, that's two guys, so...

1:01:08.293 --> 1:01:09.502
Uh...

1:01:09.544 --> 1:01:11.171
LEE-CURTIS:
I never said I was

1:01:11.212 --> 1:01:13.923
a perfect man,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:01:13.965 --> 1:01:16.676
God doesn't make perfect men.

1:01:16.718 --> 1:01:18.428
(horn honking)

1:01:18.470 --> 1:01:23.058
But what I am is a follower
of the Lord and his teach...

1:01:26.227 --> 1:01:28.355
(exhaling sharply)

1:01:36.738 --> 1:01:38.782
-(horn honks)
-WOMAN: Hey!

1:01:41.368 --> 1:01:42.994
Well, hello there.

1:01:43.036 --> 1:01:44.829
It is a beautiful day
for worship.

1:01:44.871 --> 1:01:46.331
Are you looking for
a church home?

1:01:46.373 --> 1:01:49.501
'Cause Wander to Greater Paths
Baptist is back.

1:01:49.542 --> 1:01:50.543
(mocking laugh):
Oh!

1:01:50.585 --> 1:01:52.545
Oh, ain't this some shit.

1:01:52.587 --> 1:01:54.130
(mocking laugh):
Oh.

1:01:55.173 --> 1:01:57.050
LEE-CURTIS:
God doesn't make perfect men.

1:01:57.092 --> 1:02:03.056
But what I am is a follower of
the Lord and his teachings...

1:02:07.435 --> 1:02:08.728
Uh-uh! Just fucking nasty!

1:02:08.770 --> 1:02:10.313
-Just fucking nasty!
-Just stop.

1:02:10.355 --> 1:02:12.065
All of y'all up in there
is disgusting!

1:02:12.107 --> 1:02:14.359
Especially your
fuck-ass husband!

1:02:14.401 --> 1:02:16.403
I'm not a perfect man,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:02:16.444 --> 1:02:17.612
But I'm also not the man

1:02:17.654 --> 1:02:19.030
that the media is
making me out to be.

1:02:19.072 --> 1:02:20.448
(grunts)

1:02:20.490 --> 1:02:22.534
You know, your nigga found
a fucking loophole, right?

1:02:22.575 --> 1:02:24.077
Yeah, a fucking loophole!

1:02:24.119 --> 1:02:25.829
Trying not to repeat the actions

1:02:25.870 --> 1:02:27.414
that got me here
in the first place.

1:02:27.455 --> 1:02:29.207
-Anita, we don't need
to get this. -Yeah. Uh-huh.

1:02:29.249 --> 1:02:30.458
Lee-Curtis--
he'll be right back,

1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:31.710
so you can just stop shooting.

1:02:31.751 --> 1:02:33.086
And for every sin
I've committed,

1:02:33.128 --> 1:02:35.588
I have prayed equally as much.

1:02:35.630 --> 1:02:37.048
I've been down on bent knee.

1:02:37.090 --> 1:02:39.092
-God knows that...
-MONTERIUS: Pastor Childs.

1:02:39.884 --> 1:02:42.721
Uh, hello. Uh...

1:02:42.762 --> 1:02:44.806
M-Monterius West, Pastor.

1:02:44.848 --> 1:02:47.475
Uh, I'm a member of
Wander to Greater Paths.

1:02:47.517 --> 1:02:49.769
W-Well, I was until...

1:02:49.811 --> 1:02:51.813
-Are you, now?
-Yes, sir.

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:53.106
I love your sermons.

1:02:53.148 --> 1:02:54.649
Especially on the holidays

1:02:54.691 --> 1:02:56.443
when y'all break out
them laser lights.

1:02:56.484 --> 1:02:58.278
Them laser lights my favorite.

1:02:58.319 --> 1:03:01.114
Uh, yeah.
I started that, you know?

1:03:01.156 --> 1:03:03.575
Other churches doing it now,
but I was the first.

1:03:03.616 --> 1:03:05.368
(chuckles) I believe that.

1:03:05.410 --> 1:03:07.287
Uh, anyway, sir,
I saw you over here

1:03:07.328 --> 1:03:10.040
while I was picking up
down the way, and, uh,

1:03:10.081 --> 1:03:12.834
I hear y'all about to be
back preaching, and, uh...

1:03:14.044 --> 1:03:16.421
...I just want to thank you,
Pastor Childs.

1:03:16.463 --> 1:03:18.590
My old lady brought me
to your Easter service

1:03:18.631 --> 1:03:20.467
a few years back, and...

1:03:20.508 --> 1:03:22.469
I been a different man
ever since, you know?

1:03:22.510 --> 1:03:24.137
I-I don't really believe in
all that mess

1:03:24.179 --> 1:03:25.847
they saying about you
in the news

1:03:25.889 --> 1:03:28.058
and in the paper and stuff.

1:03:28.099 --> 1:03:29.851
I know you a good man,
Pastor Childs,

1:03:29.893 --> 1:03:31.603
and you gonna keep doing
them good thing

1:03:31.644 --> 1:03:32.854
God be telling you to do

1:03:32.896 --> 1:03:36.316
and keep inspiring
folks like me.

1:03:36.358 --> 1:03:38.193
I believe that.

1:04:16.147 --> 1:04:18.191
Thanks for that, brother.

1:04:21.403 --> 1:04:22.821
Yes, sir.

1:04:22.862 --> 1:04:24.155
WOMAN:
You got your jewelry,

1:04:24.197 --> 1:04:26.241
your dresses
and your weak-ass hats.

1:04:26.282 --> 1:04:28.368
That's the real
foul-ass shit, bitch!

1:04:28.410 --> 1:04:29.953
Real weak-ass shit!

1:04:29.994 --> 1:04:33.498
-Fuck you, bitch! Yeah. Uh-huh.
-Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!

1:04:33.540 --> 1:04:35.041
Let me tell you something.

1:04:35.083 --> 1:04:38.837
Me and my husband-- we practice
love and forgiveness.

1:04:38.878 --> 1:04:40.588
We are Christians.

1:04:40.630 --> 1:04:42.257
Not saints and not God.

1:04:42.298 --> 1:04:45.552
And we are doing
the best we fucking can!

1:04:48.930 --> 1:04:50.890
Girl, fuck you!

1:04:50.932 --> 1:04:52.934
Fuck you!

1:04:56.354 --> 1:04:58.356
God bless!

1:04:58.398 --> 1:05:00.608
(horns honking)

1:05:01.568 --> 1:05:04.904
LEE-CURTIS: I'm not a perfect
man, ladies and gentlemen.

1:05:04.946 --> 1:05:07.949
God doesn't make perfect men.

1:05:08.783 --> 1:05:10.952
-What I am...
-TRINITIE: No.

1:05:11.745 --> 1:05:13.079
Nope. Nope.

1:05:13.121 --> 1:05:16.750
See, uh, that's too distant,
Lee-Curtis.

1:05:16.791 --> 1:05:18.418
We need to connect with people.

1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:22.714
Make them feel why they need
you back in that pulpit.

1:05:24.382 --> 1:05:26.718
You're not gonna sit
center pew like always?

1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:28.219
Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no.

1:05:28.261 --> 1:05:31.264
I-I want the view of the
average, everyday congregant.

1:05:31.306 --> 1:05:34.142
All right. (sighs) Now go on.

1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:41.900
I'm not a perfect man,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:05:41.941 --> 1:05:45.236
God doesn't make perfect men.

1:05:45.278 --> 1:05:49.282
What I am is
a servant of the Lord.

1:05:49.324 --> 1:05:51.284
-Now, a servant of the Lord...
-Wait.

1:05:51.326 --> 1:05:54.037
-(sighs) Wait.
-Hmm?

1:05:54.079 --> 1:05:57.207
Where's your gut, hon?

1:05:57.248 --> 1:05:58.792
Hmm?

1:05:58.833 --> 1:06:02.796
I-I'm not feeling
any transference of raw energy.

1:06:02.837 --> 1:06:04.297
You know
what I'm talking about.

1:06:04.339 --> 1:06:06.549
That's the stuff people love.

1:06:06.591 --> 1:06:08.301
Well, you won't even let me
get up to that part, Trin.

1:06:08.343 --> 1:06:10.428
See, I got to ramp up to it.

1:06:10.470 --> 1:06:12.138
Okay, go ahead, then.
Ramp up to it.

1:06:12.180 --> 1:06:13.515
I'm gonna be quiet.

1:06:17.143 --> 1:06:19.270
Ramp up. (chuckles)

1:06:20.605 --> 1:06:22.232
I...

1:06:23.191 --> 1:06:25.318
...am not a perfect man,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:27.737
God doesn't make perfect men.

1:06:27.779 --> 1:06:30.323
What I am...

1:06:30.365 --> 1:06:32.450
is a servant of the Lord.

1:06:32.492 --> 1:06:35.495
And, folks, being
the Lord's servant doesn't mean

1:06:35.537 --> 1:06:39.207
that you are not susceptible
to being lured or seduced

1:06:39.249 --> 1:06:42.544
or ambushed by the devil.

1:06:43.628 --> 1:06:47.716
But here is
the true test of faith.

1:06:48.717 --> 1:06:53.013
See, the true test
doesn't happen when you falter.

1:06:53.054 --> 1:06:54.097
Okay?

1:06:54.139 --> 1:06:55.724
It is when you're low,

1:06:55.765 --> 1:06:58.810
probably at the lowest you have
ever been in your life,

1:06:58.852 --> 1:07:01.438
but you overcome it.

1:07:02.397 --> 1:07:04.774
Mm-hmm.

1:07:04.816 --> 1:07:07.360
Yes. Yes!

1:07:07.402 --> 1:07:08.820
* *

1:07:08.862 --> 1:07:12.240
There ain't a person up in here
that hasn't been tested,

1:07:12.282 --> 1:07:16.036
tempted or torn up
by hell's angel.

1:07:16.077 --> 1:07:18.538
But we survive.

1:07:19.581 --> 1:07:21.958
Stronger,

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.044
happier

1:07:24.085 --> 1:07:26.963
and better to serve
than ever before.

1:07:27.005 --> 1:07:29.466
Hey. Mm.

1:07:29.507 --> 1:07:32.385
(laughs):
I'm better, y'all!

1:07:32.427 --> 1:07:37.849
I am better and bigger
in the eyes of Jesus Christ.

1:07:37.891 --> 1:07:39.351
And that is through the pain

1:07:39.392 --> 1:07:43.355
and through the threats
of losing everything.

1:07:47.942 --> 1:07:50.195
The things I've been through...

1:07:52.197 --> 1:07:54.115
...had me wanting
not another minute

1:07:54.157 --> 1:07:57.619
on God's beautiful earth.

1:08:02.874 --> 1:08:07.587
But it was my faith in him
that allowed me to persevere.

1:08:08.630 --> 1:08:15.303
It was his glory and his grace
that brought me back here.

1:08:15.345 --> 1:08:19.391
Back in front of you all and
back in the house of the Lord

1:08:19.432 --> 1:08:22.560
where I am supposed to be!

1:08:23.687 --> 1:08:25.230
Come on, now!

1:08:25.271 --> 1:08:31.778
No, no, I am not
a perfect man, everyone.

1:08:31.820 --> 1:08:33.321
Like I said before,

1:08:33.363 --> 1:08:37.242
God ain't exactly in the
business of making perfect men.

1:08:39.619 --> 1:08:43.039
But with his guidance
and his love--

1:08:43.081 --> 1:08:45.458
oh, Jesus--

1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:48.962
his undying
and everlasting love,

1:08:49.004 --> 1:08:53.800
he can and he does
make great men.

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:03.768
Oh, you're done.

1:09:03.810 --> 1:09:05.687
Okay, well, that-that was,
that was great.

1:09:05.729 --> 1:09:08.231
That was great, Lee-Curtis.
Really great. Yep.

1:09:09.315 --> 1:09:13.069
But for our first Sunday back
after all of this,

1:09:13.111 --> 1:09:16.406
that just doesn't ring.

1:09:16.448 --> 1:09:19.701
See, you don't quite
acknowledge...

1:09:21.578 --> 1:09:23.329
If you're trying
to make people--

1:09:23.371 --> 1:09:26.416
if you think you can
fool people into thinking...

1:09:27.542 --> 1:09:29.878
Well, you're just gonna have
to do a little bit better than

1:09:29.919 --> 1:09:33.131
just dry excuses this time, hon.

1:09:33.173 --> 1:09:36.009
When we get people
back up in here,

1:09:36.051 --> 1:09:39.220
we need to give them everything.

1:09:41.890 --> 1:09:44.059
That was everything.

1:09:44.100 --> 1:09:48.772
That up there--
that was my soul.

1:09:48.813 --> 1:09:50.690
And it's not dry.

1:09:51.775 --> 1:09:53.735
That was the truth.

1:09:57.322 --> 1:09:59.407
Then we should probably practice

1:09:59.449 --> 1:10:02.535
and make it
a little more convincing, huh?

1:10:12.128 --> 1:10:13.672
Trin?

1:10:15.548 --> 1:10:17.175
Yeah?

1:10:17.217 --> 1:10:18.927
You up, baby?

1:10:19.969 --> 1:10:21.554
Yeah, I'm up, Lee-Curtis.

1:10:21.596 --> 1:10:23.723
(Lee-Curtis breathes deeply)

1:10:23.765 --> 1:10:25.266
Me, too.

1:10:27.102 --> 1:10:28.853
Something's not right.

1:10:30.105 --> 1:10:31.523
We hurtling towards Sunday,

1:10:31.564 --> 1:10:34.901
and something doesn't feel
quite there yet.

1:10:36.069 --> 1:10:39.239
We just not really...

1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:41.533
hitting it yet.

1:10:42.784 --> 1:10:46.037
We need to do something big
out there for this last day.

1:10:47.122 --> 1:10:49.040
Something with a little oomph.

1:10:50.583 --> 1:10:53.336
Could really use
your brain on this.

1:10:55.213 --> 1:10:57.465
I'll have to think on it.

1:11:00.844 --> 1:11:02.929
Yeah. All right.

1:11:05.932 --> 1:11:07.600
(Trinitie sighs)

1:11:26.870 --> 1:11:28.621
(quietly):
Mama?

1:11:30.373 --> 1:11:32.250
(laughs)

1:11:32.292 --> 1:11:34.461
-This is too much, Mama.
-(grunts)

1:11:34.502 --> 1:11:36.338
You don't know
what you're saying. (chuckles)

1:11:36.379 --> 1:11:38.214
Are you sure you don't want

1:11:38.256 --> 1:11:40.216
Lee-Curtis to come down
and get some?

1:11:40.258 --> 1:11:43.428
Uh, well, he'll be
a while longer.

1:11:43.470 --> 1:11:46.431
Uh, I had to slip him
two Ambien last night

1:11:46.473 --> 1:11:49.726
just to get him to simmer down.

1:11:50.602 --> 1:11:53.021
He likes it. Don't worry.

1:11:54.022 --> 1:11:56.107
So, out with it.

1:11:58.151 --> 1:11:59.444
It's our last shot.

1:11:59.486 --> 1:12:00.987
Oh, girl, please.

1:12:01.029 --> 1:12:02.864
I don't know what's gonna
happen if we don't make it.

1:12:02.906 --> 1:12:05.450
I'm sure some folks
will show up on Sunday.

1:12:07.202 --> 1:12:09.621
I mean me and Lee-Curtis.

1:12:10.872 --> 1:12:12.707
I don't know

1:12:12.749 --> 1:12:15.085
(voice breaking):
if we can make it.

1:12:15.126 --> 1:12:16.544
I just...

1:12:17.420 --> 1:12:20.173
I'm here. I'm there.
I'm everywhere.

1:12:20.215 --> 1:12:25.679
And I am working my butt off
for this man and this marriage.

1:12:28.390 --> 1:12:30.725
And so is he, you know.

1:12:30.767 --> 1:12:33.103
He is working, too. I see that.

1:12:34.229 --> 1:12:35.814
I just...

1:12:35.855 --> 1:12:38.358
I just don't know if-if
we're just working towards

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:39.901
the same thing.

1:12:44.406 --> 1:12:45.699
Wow.

1:12:47.951 --> 1:12:52.664
Sometimes my child can be
so damn foolish.

1:12:54.416 --> 1:12:55.917
Are you a Christian?

1:12:55.959 --> 1:12:57.293
I'm a Christian.

1:12:57.335 --> 1:13:00.088
Say it again
so I'm absolutely sure.

1:13:02.590 --> 1:13:04.968
-I'm a Christian, Mama.
-That's good.

1:13:05.010 --> 1:13:07.846
'Cause you didn't
sound like it for a moment.

1:13:07.887 --> 1:13:08.930
(scoffs)

1:13:08.972 --> 1:13:10.640
You don't know
if this is gonna work.

1:13:10.682 --> 1:13:13.184
That's not for you to know.

1:13:13.226 --> 1:13:15.770
That's for God to determine.

1:13:16.646 --> 1:13:19.482
And he did that
15-something years ago

1:13:19.524 --> 1:13:21.401
when he blessed y'all's union.

1:13:21.443 --> 1:13:23.737
And look at
all the other blessings

1:13:23.778 --> 1:13:26.114
that you have right now
because of what?

1:13:26.156 --> 1:13:31.036
That man and your God.

1:13:31.077 --> 1:13:33.079
The young.

1:13:33.121 --> 1:13:34.873
So ready to quit.

1:13:34.914 --> 1:13:37.792
Don't you think I thought about
quitting your daddy?

1:13:39.085 --> 1:13:43.548
But every time I got shook,
I went right back to the Bible,

1:13:43.590 --> 1:13:47.427
back to the Word,
prayed it on out.

1:13:47.469 --> 1:13:50.930
And then I went back
to my husband.

1:13:52.349 --> 1:13:53.641
(sighs)

1:13:53.683 --> 1:13:55.727
And when did you have to stop

1:13:55.769 --> 1:13:59.481
running back to the Bible
about Daddy?

1:14:00.273 --> 1:14:02.609
(chuckles)

1:14:02.650 --> 1:14:05.070
When I buried him, baby.

1:14:05.111 --> 1:14:07.697
(Sabina laughs)

1:14:07.739 --> 1:14:10.700
LEE-CURTIS:
Hey there, Mama Sabina!

1:14:10.742 --> 1:14:13.036
SABINA:
Hey, love!

1:14:13.078 --> 1:14:15.538
LEE-CURTIS:
Y'all eating biscuits?

1:14:16.498 --> 1:14:18.416
TRINITIE:
You know what I said to God

1:14:18.458 --> 1:14:20.168
during my prayers last night?

1:14:20.210 --> 1:14:24.589
I said, "Lord, show me the way.

1:14:24.631 --> 1:14:27.842
"Show me what I need
on this final day

1:14:27.884 --> 1:14:30.470
of the most important week
of our lives."

1:14:30.512 --> 1:14:34.307
(chuckles):
And then you know what he did?

1:14:34.349 --> 1:14:35.975
* *

1:14:36.017 --> 1:14:38.645
Lee-Curtis, you know,
he wanted a little more oomph.

1:14:38.687 --> 1:14:41.523
So, this is it, right?

1:14:41.564 --> 1:14:43.400
This is the statement.

1:14:43.441 --> 1:14:46.111
This is, "He is risen."

1:14:46.861 --> 1:14:48.822
One time, I broke my toe.

1:14:48.863 --> 1:14:51.324
I didn't think I was gonna be
ready for one of our services.

1:14:51.366 --> 1:14:54.327
It was a women's ministry.
I prayed.

1:14:54.369 --> 1:14:56.663
It was the baby toe.
There's no cast.

1:14:56.705 --> 1:14:59.708
And I was in heels in,
I'd say, 48 hours?

1:14:59.749 --> 1:15:02.168
So I've seen miracles.

1:15:02.210 --> 1:15:04.129
LEE-CURTIS:
The Lord, ladies and gentlemen,

1:15:04.170 --> 1:15:07.841
is the be-all and end-all
of your eternity.

1:15:07.882 --> 1:15:09.509
-TRINITIE: Yes, he is.
-And eternity...

1:15:09.551 --> 1:15:11.928
-(horn honking)
-Oh, yeah! Uh, what? What?

1:15:11.970 --> 1:15:13.972
-First one. First one.
-That's one.

1:15:14.014 --> 1:15:15.015
Yes!

1:15:15.056 --> 1:15:16.891
-God loves you.
-Yes, he does.

1:15:16.933 --> 1:15:18.685
-God loves you, baby.
-God loves you.

1:15:18.727 --> 1:15:21.563
-* Well, God loves you *
-* God loves you *

1:15:21.604 --> 1:15:23.440
-* God loves you *
-(horn honks) -Yes!

1:15:23.481 --> 1:15:25.025
-Yo! That's two!
-Two.

1:15:25.066 --> 1:15:27.694
-That's two. All right.
All right. All right. -(laughs)

1:15:27.736 --> 1:15:29.070
-(horn honking) -We bumping
for Jesus over here.

1:15:29.112 --> 1:15:31.364
-Bump for Jesus, everybody.
-Come on, now.

1:15:31.406 --> 1:15:33.742
-* Hallelujah *
-Harlem shake.

1:15:33.783 --> 1:15:35.785
-* Lord Jes... * -(horn honks)
-For the Lord.

1:15:35.827 --> 1:15:37.871
That's right.
That's right, my sister.

1:15:37.912 --> 1:15:40.206
He got tears coming down his
eyes but a smile on his face.

1:15:40.248 --> 1:15:41.875
We should all be like that
for the Lord.

1:15:41.916 --> 1:15:43.543
We should all be so grateful.

1:15:43.585 --> 1:15:44.961
-(horn honks)
-I see him! -Yes! Amen!

1:15:45.003 --> 1:15:47.589
-(honking horns continue)
-Praise God. Praise God.

1:15:47.630 --> 1:15:49.090
-(Trinitie sings)
-LEE-CURTIS: You ain't ready!

1:15:49.132 --> 1:15:51.134
-(Trinitie shouting excitedly)
-You ain't ready!

1:15:58.099 --> 1:16:01.603
The only place you need to be
in a rush to go to

1:16:01.644 --> 1:16:03.730
is heaven up above.

1:16:03.772 --> 1:16:07.901
Ain't nothing on this plane
of any importance.

1:16:07.942 --> 1:16:10.737
Hello. Hey, come on, now.

1:16:14.074 --> 1:16:15.825
Trin.

1:16:15.867 --> 1:16:18.244
-Hey, Trin.
-Huh?

1:16:18.286 --> 1:16:19.913
Hey, baby, look, um,

1:16:19.954 --> 1:16:22.916
we haven't been getting
all that many beeps as of late,

1:16:22.957 --> 1:16:27.462
and I think, uh, well, I got
an idea for something bigger

1:16:27.504 --> 1:16:28.922
to really get
these folks' attention.

1:16:28.963 --> 1:16:31.091
Well, wasn't that
what our dear friend Jesus

1:16:31.132 --> 1:16:32.509
was here for, hon?

1:16:32.550 --> 1:16:35.261
Jesus is real great, and
it was a brilliant idea, baby.

1:16:35.303 --> 1:16:37.597
And he was a huge help
getting folks hyped for Sunday.

1:16:37.639 --> 1:16:39.265
It's just-- I'm talking about

1:16:39.307 --> 1:16:42.018
sealing this thing up
with a bang, right?

1:16:42.060 --> 1:16:43.728
Putting on a real performance.

1:16:43.770 --> 1:16:45.438
-Show them that we back...
-Mm-hmm.

1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:47.941
...and we better than ever
and that we are serious about

1:16:47.982 --> 1:16:49.734
saving their everlasting souls.

1:16:49.776 --> 1:16:54.155
But maybe something like...

1:17:07.127 --> 1:17:08.378
No.

1:17:08.420 --> 1:17:10.797
No. You cannot be serious.

1:17:10.839 --> 1:17:12.841
It would be outstanding, baby!

1:17:12.882 --> 1:17:15.635
We got to draw them
back in, Trin.

1:17:15.677 --> 1:17:17.887
Make them remember
what they were missing.

1:17:17.929 --> 1:17:21.433
This is it, baby.
This is what we need.

1:17:21.474 --> 1:17:24.144
-I...
-Trin,

1:17:24.185 --> 1:17:25.353
this right here...

1:17:26.521 --> 1:17:27.897
...this is ego.

1:17:27.939 --> 1:17:29.315
You know what ego is?

1:17:29.357 --> 1:17:31.317
That is edging God out.

1:17:31.359 --> 1:17:34.154
And that's what
you're doing right now.

1:17:34.195 --> 1:17:35.697
Now, are you really
gonna be the barrier

1:17:35.739 --> 1:17:39.200
that keeps me
from saving souls?!

1:17:39.242 --> 1:17:40.493
Hey, Trin, look at me.

1:17:40.535 --> 1:17:42.078
You look at me now, okay?

1:17:42.120 --> 1:17:45.081
I need this.

1:17:46.791 --> 1:17:49.711
I need to save souls, baby.

1:17:49.753 --> 1:17:52.047
(siren wailing)

1:18:06.394 --> 1:18:08.438
* *

1:18:23.745 --> 1:18:27.040
* Never would've made it *

1:18:27.082 --> 1:18:29.542
(people shouting, clapping)

1:18:29.584 --> 1:18:32.837
* I would have lost it all *

1:18:32.879 --> 1:18:37.759
* But now I see
how you were there for me *

1:18:37.801 --> 1:18:40.053
* And I can say *

1:18:40.095 --> 1:18:43.598
* Never would've made it *

1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:45.975
* Oh, I never could've made it *

1:18:46.017 --> 1:18:51.398
* Never could've made it
without you *

1:18:51.439 --> 1:18:53.942
* I would've lost my mind *

1:18:53.983 --> 1:18:56.069
* A long time ago *

1:18:56.111 --> 1:18:58.988
* If it had not been for you *

1:18:59.030 --> 1:19:02.909
* I... I'm stronger *

1:19:02.951 --> 1:19:04.411
* I'm stronger *

1:19:04.452 --> 1:19:06.246
-* I'm wiser *
-* I'm wiser*

1:19:06.287 --> 1:19:08.498
-(horn honking)
-* And now I'm better *

1:19:08.540 --> 1:19:10.166
* I'm better*

1:19:10.208 --> 1:19:12.752
-* So much better *
-* Much better...*

1:19:12.794 --> 1:19:14.254
TRINITIE:
Let me just tell you

1:19:14.295 --> 1:19:16.047
a little something
about praise mimes.

1:19:16.089 --> 1:19:19.092
When it comes down to it,
they are entertainers.

1:19:19.134 --> 1:19:22.178
You know, a-a... a sideshow.

1:19:22.220 --> 1:19:23.471
And...

1:19:23.513 --> 1:19:27.559
You know, Lee-Curtis is
a talent, a... a star,

1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:29.728
but he's so raw.

1:19:29.769 --> 1:19:31.771
He's-he's... he's raw.

1:19:31.813 --> 1:19:35.775
He... he needs someone
to harness it all, and...

1:19:35.817 --> 1:19:38.403
(song continues quietly)

1:19:38.445 --> 1:19:40.280
...I did that.

1:19:40.321 --> 1:19:42.323
I am not an unreasonable person,

1:19:42.365 --> 1:19:46.327
but to have his first lady--
I mean, his wife...

1:19:48.329 --> 1:19:52.459
...out here on the side
of the road reduced to...

1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:55.795
* All I need is
just one more time *

1:19:55.837 --> 1:19:58.131
* Everybody, sing with me *

1:19:58.173 --> 1:20:01.301
-* Never would've made it...*
-(chuckles)

1:20:01.343 --> 1:20:04.220
(gospel music playing
over stereo)

1:20:04.262 --> 1:20:05.930
LEE-CURTIS (over bullhorn):
Everybody, come get

1:20:05.972 --> 1:20:07.682
-your spiritual food.
-(horn honks)

1:20:07.724 --> 1:20:10.143
You take care of your body.
You take care of your mind.

1:20:10.185 --> 1:20:11.519
Come take care of your soul

1:20:11.561 --> 1:20:14.314
at Wander to Greater Paths
Baptist Church.

1:20:14.356 --> 1:20:16.566
Open this Sunday!

1:20:16.608 --> 1:20:18.068
God bless you.

1:20:18.109 --> 1:20:20.487
(rap music playing quietly
over car stereo)

1:20:20.528 --> 1:20:22.655
-You want to give a honk
for Jesus? -Yes, sir.

1:20:22.697 --> 1:20:24.991
Yes, sir. How you doing?

1:20:26.659 --> 1:20:29.412
Wander to Greater Paths Baptist
Church open this Sunday.

1:20:29.454 --> 1:20:32.290
-(horns honking) -Yeah! Hey.
-MAN: Hey, y'all got to move.

1:20:32.332 --> 1:20:34.125
-LEE-CURTIS: Hey, hey, hey.
-MAN: People got places to go.

1:20:34.167 --> 1:20:36.169
Khalil, I think you're
holding up traffic, honey.

1:20:36.211 --> 1:20:38.672
LEE-CURTIS: ...living
deep down in your soul.

1:20:38.713 --> 1:20:39.964
WOMAN:
Can you go?!

1:20:40.006 --> 1:20:41.633
LEE-CURTIS:
How can you not be weird?

1:20:41.675 --> 1:20:43.051
How can you not be strange?

1:20:43.093 --> 1:20:44.636
-MAN: Move your car!
-You got to let it out.

1:20:44.678 --> 1:20:46.137
Listen to me, Khalil.

1:20:46.179 --> 1:20:50.100
The pastor-- he is truly
repentant about everything.

1:20:50.141 --> 1:20:51.935
And I can promise you that.

1:20:51.976 --> 1:20:53.019
I can. I can.

1:20:53.061 --> 1:20:55.438
He is, he is better.

1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:56.940
LEE-CURTIS:
Hey, now.

1:20:56.981 --> 1:20:59.067
MAN: Hey, y'all got to move.
We got places to go!

1:20:59.109 --> 1:21:00.652
(horns continue honking)

1:21:00.694 --> 1:21:02.278
You can't do this.

1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:05.699
We are trying really hard
to make things right again,

1:21:05.740 --> 1:21:07.951
get everything back
to normal again.

1:21:07.992 --> 1:21:11.287
He's back right with God.

1:21:11.329 --> 1:21:13.206
All right?

1:21:13.248 --> 1:21:14.916
He is.

1:21:17.127 --> 1:21:19.587
(horns continue honking)

1:21:22.007 --> 1:21:23.758
Well, uh...

1:21:24.801 --> 1:21:28.138
Anyway, we don't really need
to be discussing this, do we?

1:21:28.179 --> 1:21:31.224
You know what the terms of
the settlement are, so I...

1:21:31.266 --> 1:21:33.059
SHEROD:
Yo, hey. Yo, hey!

1:21:33.101 --> 1:21:35.895
Come on, man. I can't just
park my shit right here.

1:21:35.937 --> 1:21:37.564
TRINITIE:
Please don't do this.

1:21:37.605 --> 1:21:38.898
Please, Kha...

1:21:38.940 --> 1:21:40.734
Please, Khalil, don't do this.

1:21:40.775 --> 1:21:41.985
Don't.

1:21:42.027 --> 1:21:44.279
-(honking stops)
-(traffic passing)

1:22:05.467 --> 1:22:07.344
Hey, stop. Don't...

1:22:13.641 --> 1:22:15.977
(Khalil laughs)

1:22:16.019 --> 1:22:17.479
Stop, man.

1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:20.815
(laughing)

1:22:20.857 --> 1:22:23.485
Come on, now,
you don't have to...

1:22:23.526 --> 1:22:25.779
Let's just
gather ourselves toget...

1:22:25.820 --> 1:22:28.406
(Khalil continues laughing,
clapping)

1:22:30.116 --> 1:22:32.118
What do you want me
to say here, okay?

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:33.578
I'm just trying
to get myself back on track

1:22:33.620 --> 1:22:35.538
so I can do the good work
for the Lord, that's all.

1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:39.084
You know, hey, can we just cut
for a minute here, please?

1:22:39.125 --> 1:22:40.960
Everybody, just take a--

1:22:41.002 --> 1:22:43.296
Let's just take ten, okay?

1:22:45.090 --> 1:22:47.258
Can we take ten?

1:22:52.764 --> 1:22:54.349
Yo...

1:22:55.266 --> 1:22:57.352
...you still like me, man?

1:23:00.146 --> 1:23:02.524
Be real with me, man.
What was it? What?

1:23:03.525 --> 1:23:06.361
Young broke niggas
your weakness?

1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:13.827
I needed you back then, man.

1:23:13.868 --> 1:23:15.870
I really did.

1:23:15.912 --> 1:23:17.956
It's fucking stupid, I know.

1:23:17.997 --> 1:23:21.042
I didn't realize
it wasn't just me.

1:23:21.084 --> 1:23:23.086
-That's...
-I wasn't the only one

1:23:23.128 --> 1:23:24.671
walking around
with brand-new shoes

1:23:24.713 --> 1:23:27.465
and a Camaro?

1:23:27.507 --> 1:23:29.050
Huh?

1:23:30.093 --> 1:23:33.304
That's that shit.
That's that shit you do to...

1:23:38.810 --> 1:23:41.396
This city don't need you, man.

1:23:42.355 --> 1:23:46.735
We've all been doing
really good without you.

1:23:47.694 --> 1:23:50.071
Nobody needs you.

1:23:50.113 --> 1:23:52.032
Nobody needs your suits.

1:23:52.073 --> 1:23:54.701
Nobody needs your fucking
green screen backdrops

1:23:54.743 --> 1:23:56.036
of the Last Supper.

1:23:56.077 --> 1:23:57.078
We don't need it.

1:23:57.120 --> 1:23:58.580
Shut up!

1:23:58.621 --> 1:24:00.081
Shut the...

1:24:00.123 --> 1:24:01.416
Shut up.

1:24:01.458 --> 1:24:03.251
You watch the way
you talk to me, boy.

1:24:03.293 --> 1:24:06.838
I still got a lot of good
to do in this world.

1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:09.090
A lot of souls to be saved.

1:24:09.132 --> 1:24:12.302
I saved myself.

1:24:14.763 --> 1:24:16.473
Now, I don't know about

1:24:16.514 --> 1:24:18.600
all that other stuff
that you was talking about,

1:24:18.641 --> 1:24:22.479
but what I do know
is that I did try to save you.

1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:24.189
I really did.

1:24:25.857 --> 1:24:28.068
Now, you...

1:24:28.109 --> 1:24:30.236
you may be beyond me.

1:24:30.278 --> 1:24:32.989
You may be beyond
what I can do for you.

1:24:33.031 --> 1:24:34.616
TRINITIE:
Wait!

1:24:43.792 --> 1:24:45.794
Fuck you, nigga.

1:24:56.388 --> 1:24:59.432
-(car door opens, closes)
-(rap music playing)

1:24:59.474 --> 1:25:01.726
(car driving off,
tires squealing)

1:25:09.651 --> 1:25:10.735
(sniffles)

1:25:10.777 --> 1:25:12.278
How do you know

1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:14.948
if you're standing in the way
of your own blessings?

1:25:14.989 --> 1:25:16.616
-(Lee-Curtis chuckles)
-(bullhorn feedback squeaks)

1:25:16.658 --> 1:25:18.785
See, sometimes
you got to step aside

1:25:18.827 --> 1:25:21.788
so the Lord can show up
and work for you.

1:25:22.789 --> 1:25:24.416
Hey, Trin!

1:25:25.583 --> 1:25:27.460
Hey, babe, can you give me
another battery, please?

1:25:27.502 --> 1:25:30.130
This thing seems to be
going out on...

1:25:30.171 --> 1:25:31.881
-Trin?
-(feedback squeaks)

1:25:31.923 --> 1:25:34.342
Trin? Trinitie!

1:25:35.218 --> 1:25:37.887
No. No.

1:25:37.929 --> 1:25:40.181
She's fine.

1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:45.979
Besides all that,
what happened over there--

1:25:46.021 --> 1:25:47.939
that's not what this is about.

1:25:49.357 --> 1:25:51.484
That's not why
you all are here, okay?

1:25:51.526 --> 1:25:53.987
We've moved on from that.

1:25:54.029 --> 1:25:56.656
-This is about rebirth...
-Stop.

1:25:56.698 --> 1:25:59.117
-...and renewal
-(Trinitie panting)

1:25:59.159 --> 1:26:01.745
and resurrection from the dead.

1:26:01.786 --> 1:26:04.289
-TRINITIE: Fuck!
-That's what this is about.

1:26:04.330 --> 1:26:05.832
(Trinitie groans)

1:26:05.874 --> 1:26:08.376
* *

1:26:14.466 --> 1:26:16.885
All right, that's it now.
We are done.

1:26:17.802 --> 1:26:20.263
LEE-CURTIS:
Because I'm here, baby.

1:26:21.056 --> 1:26:23.350
And I'm not going anywhere.

1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:33.860
TRINITIE:
I said I am done, so take it,

1:26:33.902 --> 1:26:36.780
do with it what you will
because I am done!

1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:41.201
You came, you silently judged,

1:26:41.242 --> 1:26:43.578
you poked, and you got it,
didn't you?

1:26:43.620 --> 1:26:46.456
You got what you came for,
so just leave.

1:26:46.498 --> 1:26:48.083
-Jesus Christ! No.
-LEE-CURTIS: Trinitie.

1:26:48.124 --> 1:26:50.126
-Let's get ourselves together
here. -No, no, no, no, no.

1:26:50.168 --> 1:26:51.503
-Okay?
-Not now. No!

1:26:51.544 --> 1:26:54.047
-Hey, it's o... okay.
-Not now! Not you!

1:26:54.089 --> 1:26:55.548
-Trinitie.
-I am serious, Lee-Curtis.

1:26:55.590 --> 1:26:57.884
-Do not touch me.
-Okay. Okay.

1:26:57.926 --> 1:27:00.762
-Do not even breathe
near me right now. -I won't.

1:27:03.181 --> 1:27:05.975
What do you all want
from me? Huh?

1:27:07.519 --> 1:27:11.272
All of you,
what the fuck do you want?

1:27:11.314 --> 1:27:13.233
You want it on the record?
Is that it?

1:27:13.274 --> 1:27:15.944
Is that, is that, is that what
you want? Okay, fine. Fine.

1:27:15.985 --> 1:27:18.697
Yes, there was a point in my
marriage where I did not think

1:27:18.738 --> 1:27:20.407
that we could reconcile
our differences.

1:27:20.448 --> 1:27:21.658
There it is.

1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:24.577
Every last one of
those people out there--

1:27:24.619 --> 1:27:27.038
we were there for them.

1:27:27.080 --> 1:27:28.707
We helped them.

1:27:28.748 --> 1:27:32.836
We spiritually nurtured them
and guided them to Christ.

1:27:35.630 --> 1:27:38.299
Now they want us to fail.

1:27:40.135 --> 1:27:43.054
They want us to fail.

1:27:43.096 --> 1:27:45.015
Can you believe that?

1:27:48.893 --> 1:27:50.645
You can.

1:27:51.730 --> 1:27:53.898
Sure, you can.

1:27:55.358 --> 1:27:58.653
Don't think for one moment

1:27:58.695 --> 1:28:00.613
that I haven't known
what you were up to

1:28:00.655 --> 1:28:04.409
from the second that you
stepped foot in this church.

1:28:05.535 --> 1:28:08.371
You came to show
the big bad wolves

1:28:08.413 --> 1:28:10.040
who eat up
all the little piggies.

1:28:10.081 --> 1:28:11.416
Well, guess what.

1:28:11.458 --> 1:28:13.877
Those are not little piggies
out there!

1:28:13.918 --> 1:28:15.628
I am!

1:28:15.670 --> 1:28:18.673
Right here! I am the victim!

1:28:21.176 --> 1:28:24.012
ANITA:
Why don't you just...

1:28:24.054 --> 1:28:25.638
leave?

1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:27.974
LEE-CURTIS: Why would you
ask her something like that?

1:28:28.016 --> 1:28:29.309
(Trinitie exhales)

1:28:29.351 --> 1:28:32.479
TRINITIE:
So she speaks. Look at that.

1:28:32.520 --> 1:28:36.816
You-you broke your little
fly-on-the-wall code, huh?

1:28:36.858 --> 1:28:40.403
What are you even
doing here, Anita? Hmm?

1:28:40.445 --> 1:28:42.614
Why are you even here?

1:28:43.740 --> 1:28:48.328
ANITA: I'm just showing
this city and this culture.

1:28:48.370 --> 1:28:52.749
I want to understand
you and Lee-Curtis, and...

1:28:54.250 --> 1:28:56.586
...I want to understand
the truth.

1:28:58.046 --> 1:28:59.589
Yeah?

1:28:59.631 --> 1:29:04.386
Well, that is bullshit
if I have ever heard it.

1:29:06.513 --> 1:29:11.059
"Why don't you just leave?"
Blah, blah, blah.

1:29:11.101 --> 1:29:13.687
Is that it? Come on, girl.
Is that all you got?

1:29:13.728 --> 1:29:16.815
Because those kinds of questions

1:29:16.856 --> 1:29:18.692
are not gonna get you
to any real truth.

1:29:18.733 --> 1:29:20.985
Trust me. I have asked them.

1:29:23.738 --> 1:29:25.448
You...

1:29:27.158 --> 1:29:29.411
...and you...

1:29:31.162 --> 1:29:33.415
...and you...

1:29:35.834 --> 1:29:37.877
...and you...

1:29:39.045 --> 1:29:42.173
...and all those folks out
there who are gonna see this...

1:29:43.758 --> 1:29:47.846
...I want them to know that I
did what I was supposed to do.

1:29:47.887 --> 1:29:52.517
I prayed, I knelt,
and I was good.

1:29:58.565 --> 1:30:01.776
So, yes, this is mine.

1:30:02.652 --> 1:30:06.489
This is... this is my church.

1:30:08.700 --> 1:30:10.952
And that is my husband.

1:30:13.913 --> 1:30:17.917
And I would sooner kill him
than leave him.

1:30:29.220 --> 1:30:30.972
(exhales softly)

1:30:38.104 --> 1:30:39.647
(groans)

1:30:41.483 --> 1:30:42.984
(sniffles)

1:30:55.914 --> 1:30:57.624
DESHAWN:
Hey, water, water.

1:30:57.665 --> 1:30:59.125
-BOY: Water.
-Come get your water.

1:30:59.167 --> 1:31:02.128
-Water. Water. Water.
-Water. Water. Water.

1:31:02.170 --> 1:31:03.963
DESHAWN: Ah, come get you some.
I got you.

1:31:04.005 --> 1:31:05.924
-Oh, yeah.
-Appreciate it.

1:31:05.965 --> 1:31:08.385
We used to sell
right next to that big church.

1:31:08.426 --> 1:31:09.844
The let-out was prime.

1:31:09.886 --> 1:31:12.347
All them folks hot and thirsty

1:31:12.389 --> 1:31:15.975
after sitting in that
hot-ass sanctuary for hours.

1:31:16.017 --> 1:31:19.229
Dang, they-they opening
back up for real? (chuckles)

1:31:19.270 --> 1:31:22.774
Man, that would be
very, very good for business.

1:31:22.816 --> 1:31:24.401
Folks ain't been
out that way in a minute.

1:31:24.442 --> 1:31:25.777
ANITA:
Do you think that they have

1:31:25.819 --> 1:31:28.113
a good chance
at drawing a crowd today?

1:31:28.154 --> 1:31:29.197
Man...

1:31:30.573 --> 1:31:32.951
I-I mean, it's still
a little early, you know.

1:31:34.035 --> 1:31:36.329
LEE-CURTIS:
Look-it here, look-it here.

1:31:36.371 --> 1:31:38.456
-Hello.
-Culpeppers looking sharp.

1:31:38.498 --> 1:31:39.833
It's so good to see...

1:31:39.874 --> 1:31:41.835
LEE-CURTIS:
How many you thinking, baby?

1:31:41.876 --> 1:31:44.713
Well, at least five.
That's for sure.

1:31:44.754 --> 1:31:47.173
Ah, the old reliables
don't count.

1:31:47.215 --> 1:31:51.052
You know, I'm thinking
maybe a smooth 500.

1:31:51.094 --> 1:31:54.389
You know, I don't want to be
overconfident, but, uh...

1:31:54.431 --> 1:31:55.932
DESHAWN:
If I had to go

1:31:55.974 --> 1:31:59.853
based on the word on the street
and my gut...

1:32:02.272 --> 1:32:04.274
(sighs)

1:32:04.315 --> 1:32:05.525
LEE-CURTIS:
Trinitie...

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:08.653
...I'm not so sure
the hat is a good idea, baby.

1:32:08.695 --> 1:32:10.030
I'm really not.

1:32:10.071 --> 1:32:11.740
You know, folks are
gonna want to see us

1:32:11.781 --> 1:32:14.367
looking spectacular,
you know, confident.

1:32:14.409 --> 1:32:19.789
And, uh, well, the hat might
hurt us just a little bit.

1:32:21.041 --> 1:32:22.959
Trin?

1:32:23.001 --> 1:32:25.712
Please? The last day of
the cameras, you know.

1:32:25.754 --> 1:32:27.964
Final chapter of our book.
Could you...

1:32:28.006 --> 1:32:29.257
Lee-Curtis...

1:32:30.258 --> 1:32:32.552
...there's gonna have to be
a line between

1:32:32.594 --> 1:32:37.182
some things you say to me
and some, like this hat,

1:32:37.223 --> 1:32:42.270
that you keep to yourself
or between you and your God.

1:32:42.312 --> 1:32:43.813
Okay?

1:32:48.568 --> 1:32:52.072
Well, "ah-men" to that, then.

1:32:57.494 --> 1:32:59.412
ANITA: Have you guys discussed
what happened yesterday

1:32:59.454 --> 1:33:02.749
-and how it might affect you...
-Uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1:33:02.791 --> 1:33:04.376
No, no, no, no.

1:33:04.417 --> 1:33:07.671
We are moving forward.

1:33:07.712 --> 1:33:09.798
Like I have been saying
from the beginning,

1:33:09.839 --> 1:33:11.841
we are starting over brand-new.

1:33:11.883 --> 1:33:13.385
That's right, baby.

1:33:13.426 --> 1:33:16.179
That is so right. (chuckles)

1:33:23.103 --> 1:33:25.063
Ah.

1:33:26.189 --> 1:33:27.607
(Trinitie sighs)

1:33:27.649 --> 1:33:29.109
-Trinitie.
-Hmm?

1:33:29.150 --> 1:33:30.652
Look.

1:33:30.694 --> 1:33:32.404
Baby, look. There.

1:33:32.445 --> 1:33:34.114
Right there. You see that?

1:33:34.155 --> 1:33:37.117
-That, uh, Mustang there?
-Hmm.

1:33:38.118 --> 1:33:40.453
See, I told ya.

1:33:40.495 --> 1:33:41.788
This is what I mean!

1:33:41.830 --> 1:33:45.458
This is
the goddamn comeback, baby!

1:33:45.500 --> 1:33:48.378
(gospel music playing faintly)

1:33:50.672 --> 1:33:53.341
SHAKURA:
We just love preaching together.

1:33:54.342 --> 1:33:57.762
I mean, one day,
God just called us to it,

1:33:57.804 --> 1:33:59.264
told us that, as a team,

1:33:59.305 --> 1:34:03.643
we could reach far beyond
our deepest prayers, and...

1:34:03.685 --> 1:34:06.021
(both laugh)

1:34:06.062 --> 1:34:07.605
ANITA: Did you know
Wander to Greater Paths

1:34:07.647 --> 1:34:09.816
was opening back up today?

1:34:09.858 --> 1:34:11.443
SHAKURA:
Uh...

1:34:12.736 --> 1:34:15.030
You know what?
I-I don't think that we knew

1:34:15.071 --> 1:34:18.324
that Wander to Greater Paths
was opening back up today.

1:34:18.366 --> 1:34:21.703
Now, they seem pretty sold
on-on Easter. (chuckles)

1:34:21.745 --> 1:34:24.330
To be honest, we were, too.

1:34:24.372 --> 1:34:25.790
But, um, we prayed on it,

1:34:25.832 --> 1:34:28.668
and-and we came
to the conclusion...

1:34:28.710 --> 1:34:30.003
KEON:
Mm-hmm.

1:34:30.045 --> 1:34:33.590
...that they needed Easter,
not us.

1:34:33.631 --> 1:34:35.592
So we moved it. (chuckles)

1:34:35.633 --> 1:34:38.345
-If we had known...
-Mm.

1:34:38.386 --> 1:34:40.013
...Lord, we would have never.

1:34:40.055 --> 1:34:43.016
We wish them
nothing but the best

1:34:43.058 --> 1:34:44.809
and pray that they flourish

1:34:44.851 --> 1:34:46.561
-and can keep it together.
-Amen.

1:34:46.603 --> 1:34:47.687
God's got 'em.

1:34:47.729 --> 1:34:49.230
But, uh, just in case

1:34:49.272 --> 1:34:51.900
the devil is too big
of a beast to wrestle

1:34:51.941 --> 1:34:53.651
and they ever feel the need
to step back again...

1:34:53.693 --> 1:34:54.986
Heaven's House
will be right there
