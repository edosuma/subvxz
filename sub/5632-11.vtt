WEBVTT

00:00.011 --> 00:01.415
<i>Previously on</i> Bones...

00:01.416 --> 00:02.519
<i>Hodgins was called out</i>

00:02.520 --> 00:04.248
<i>to the scene</i>
<i>at Columbia Heights.</i>

00:04.348 --> 00:05.380
Something is not right

00:05.416 --> 00:06.515
underneath this guy's shirt.

00:06.550 --> 00:07.830
They wanted us to find
this body.

00:08.352 --> 00:10.218
Back! Now!

00:13.290 --> 00:14.823
Cam, what happened?
I don't know.

00:14.858 --> 00:16.325
Hodgins and Aubrey--
they were-- they were

00:16.360 --> 00:17.726
right there when
the body blew up.

00:17.761 --> 00:18.894
Oh, my God.

00:18.929 --> 00:19.995
Hey, I'm okay.

00:20.030 --> 00:21.897
Nothing a little aspirin
can't cure.

00:21.932 --> 00:22.998
How about Aubrey?

00:23.033 --> 00:24.433
<i>I saw them rushing him</i>

00:24.468 --> 00:26.134
<i>into surgery.</i>
<i>It didn't look good.</i>

00:26.170 --> 00:27.202
He pulled me out of the way.

00:27.237 --> 00:28.670
He used his body as a shield.

00:28.706 --> 00:30.372
I'm ready.

00:30.407 --> 00:32.674
Ready for what?
To have another baby.

00:34.678 --> 00:35.977
That sounds like...
Angela.

00:36.013 --> 00:37.579
Help!

00:37.614 --> 00:39.381
Angela, what happened?

00:39.416 --> 00:41.817
We were walking out and-and...
and he fell.

00:41.852 --> 00:44.786
Hodgins is paralyzed, Angela.

00:50.828 --> 00:53.428
<i>Ready?</i>

00:53.464 --> 00:55.997
Yup.
Okay, take your time.

00:56.033 --> 00:57.165
Good.

01:00.404 --> 01:02.604
See? It's easy.

01:02.639 --> 01:04.605
You ready to go home?
Oh, yeah.

01:04.641 --> 01:06.241
Eight weeks here is
eight weeks too many.

01:06.276 --> 01:07.709
No offense to you there, Doc.

01:07.745 --> 01:11.012
Mm, well, promise me you will
take care of yourself.

01:11.048 --> 01:13.048
Your body is still in shock.

01:13.083 --> 01:16.518
But you're letting me out of
here, so I must be doing well.

01:16.553 --> 01:17.919
We'll keep an eye
on your lumbar nerves,

01:17.955 --> 01:19.488
see if there's any
signs of regeneration.

01:19.523 --> 01:22.224
Doc, listen, I felt tingling
in my feet this morning.

01:22.259 --> 01:24.493
It could mean a lot of things.

01:24.528 --> 01:26.194
We'll keep monitoring.

01:26.230 --> 01:29.331
I need you to take it slow.

01:29.366 --> 01:31.566
Hey, so the bags
are in the car,

01:31.602 --> 01:33.034
and the paperwork
is signed,

01:33.070 --> 01:34.836
and I did hear that part

01:34.872 --> 01:36.471
about you taking it slow.

01:36.507 --> 01:37.973
No work yet.

01:38.008 --> 01:39.808
The hematoma crushed the nerves
on your lower spine,

01:39.843 --> 01:41.343
but it didn't sever them,

01:41.378 --> 01:43.478
which means they're still prone
to further damage.

01:43.514 --> 01:46.348
Right now you have
mobility above the waist.

01:46.383 --> 01:48.650
You can breathe on your own.
Protect that.

01:48.685 --> 01:51.086
Okay, let's go home.

01:51.121 --> 01:55.157
Yes, that is the best idea
you've ever had.

02:01.265 --> 02:02.464
<i>That's great news.</i>

02:02.499 --> 02:03.765
Hodgins is finally home.

02:03.801 --> 02:05.233
It's certainly an improvement

02:05.269 --> 02:07.302
over the rehabilitation hospital.
Oh, come on.

02:07.337 --> 02:08.870
This is good stuff.
He's been through a lot.

02:08.906 --> 02:10.806
Things are finally getting
back to normal.

02:10.841 --> 02:13.008
I do not think
that is the case.

02:13.043 --> 02:16.511
I... examined
the results of his MRI,

02:16.547 --> 02:18.213
and I read extensively

02:18.248 --> 02:20.916
on spinal trauma.
Sorry, but what are you saying?

02:20.951 --> 02:23.251
Hodgins will almost
certainly never walk again.

02:23.287 --> 02:24.786
Come on, you don't
know that.

02:24.822 --> 02:26.221
Okay, no one's going
to work harder than Hodgins.

02:26.256 --> 02:28.089
It's not a question
of hard work, Booth.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.524
Sure it is, Bones.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.059
Look, I've seen my share
of this kind of thing.

02:31.094 --> 02:32.661
You're referring
to your experience

02:32.696 --> 02:34.029
with soldiers
wounded in war?

02:34.064 --> 02:35.564
Look,
the emotional recovery

02:35.599 --> 02:37.399
can be as tough
as the physical one,

02:37.434 --> 02:40.619
but there's nothing more
important than hope.

02:42.022 --> 02:45.791
A city worker found a body
off the expressway.

02:45.826 --> 02:47.259
They're bringing it
to the lab now.

02:47.294 --> 02:48.827
All right, I'll
drop you there.

02:48.862 --> 02:51.463
<i>The predation to the body</i>
<i>is extensive.</i>

02:51.498 --> 02:55.267
Likely rats, based on the teeth
marks to the cortical surfaces.

02:55.302 --> 02:56.635
Well, they certainly
went to town

02:56.670 --> 02:58.737
on the victim's
clothing and organs.

02:58.772 --> 03:01.206
The small mastoid processes
suggest

03:01.241 --> 03:03.275
the victim was female.

03:03.310 --> 03:05.076
And the medial
clavicular epiphyses

03:05.112 --> 03:06.611
are almost completely fused.

03:06.647 --> 03:09.447
It gives us an age range
between 24 and 32.

03:09.483 --> 03:10.649
The sixth and seventh ribs

03:10.684 --> 03:12.250
evince remodeled damage,

03:12.286 --> 03:15.120
possibly consistent
with stabbing.

03:15.155 --> 03:16.354
And they appear to be

03:16.390 --> 03:18.523
at least one year old.

03:18.559 --> 03:21.459
The temporal, zygomatic,
and nasal bones show

03:21.495 --> 03:23.228
complete,
comminuted fracturing.

03:23.263 --> 03:24.529
That kind of blunt force trauma

03:24.565 --> 03:25.831
could cause a fatal brain
hemorrhage.

03:25.866 --> 03:28.066
It is likely our cause of death.

03:28.101 --> 03:29.167
If we can figure out time
of death,

03:29.203 --> 03:30.602
we may be able to match her

03:30.637 --> 03:32.904
to a missing persons report.
Mr. Bray,

03:32.940 --> 03:34.539
you've been
studying blowflies.

03:34.575 --> 03:36.455
Do you feel confident making
that determination?

03:37.344 --> 03:39.644
These are <i>Calliphoridae</i> larvae.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.414
They are first generation,
suggesting our body

03:42.449 --> 03:43.682
is one day old.

03:43.717 --> 03:45.617
With this level
of decomposition?

03:45.652 --> 03:46.952
I agree, it's odd.

03:46.987 --> 03:48.553
What am I missing?

03:48.589 --> 03:50.155
Bertha.

03:50.190 --> 03:51.957
Dr. Hodgins,

03:51.992 --> 03:53.692
welcome back.

03:55.112 --> 03:57.178
Well, a surprise is,
by definition, unexpected,se.

03:57.214 --> 03:58.346
but yes.

03:58.382 --> 03:59.614
We are happy to see you.

03:59.650 --> 04:01.049
The doctor said
he shouldn't be

04:01.084 --> 04:03.518
back at work so soon,
but Hodgins threatened

04:03.554 --> 04:04.753
to hitchhike
if I didn't bring him

04:04.788 --> 04:06.154
by to say hello.

04:06.189 --> 04:08.023
Yeah, and it seems like we
got here just in time.

04:08.058 --> 04:10.225
Wendell, you forgot
about tropical storm Bertha.

04:10.260 --> 04:13.828
Ah, it rained for
hours this weekend.

04:13.864 --> 04:15.330
Yeah, 18 hours.

04:15.365 --> 04:17.866
Blowflies don't fly in the rain,
and if they don't fly...

04:17.901 --> 04:19.466
They don't colonize.

04:19.503 --> 04:22.737
I mistook time of insect
colonization for time of death.

04:22.773 --> 04:24.439
Factor in the delayed bug
activity,

04:24.474 --> 04:26.441
and this body is more
than two days old.

04:26.476 --> 04:28.343
Excellent work, Dr. Hodgins.

04:28.378 --> 04:30.445
I really missed you, man.
We all have.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.781
I-If you guys give us
a little bit of time

04:32.816 --> 04:34.349
to finish our
preliminary exam,

04:34.384 --> 04:35.717
we can all grab lunch.

04:35.752 --> 04:37.385
Oh, no, we don't have time
for lunch.

04:37.421 --> 04:38.553
What do you mean?

04:38.589 --> 04:40.789
I'm working this case.

Cam, I do not know how you
managed to get along without me

05:25.710 --> 05:27.243
because I have already found...

05:27.278 --> 05:29.645
Dr. Hodgins,
I'm aware of your condition.

05:29.681 --> 05:31.914
There's a reason why your doctor
told you not to do too much.

05:31.950 --> 05:32.950
I feel good.

05:32.984 --> 05:33.916
As a friend, I need you

05:33.952 --> 05:34.952
to take care of yourself.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.119
But as your co-worker,

05:36.154 --> 05:37.253
I'm helping you solve this case.

05:37.288 --> 05:38.421
Check it out.

05:38.456 --> 05:40.223
I found it in the
victim's pocket.

05:40.258 --> 05:41.891
She wasn't wearing it?
Nope.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.127
And the chain is broken,
which could tell us something

05:44.162 --> 05:45.895
about how she died. Plus...

05:45.930 --> 05:47.330
there's an inscription on it.

05:47.365 --> 05:49.499
Saint John the Divine
Catholic Church.

05:49.534 --> 05:51.134
There's one here in D.C.

05:51.169 --> 05:53.102
See? You need me.

05:53.138 --> 05:55.204
I cleaned the bones.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.606
I don't think we
got all of them.

05:56.641 --> 05:58.541
We swept the crime scene
thoroughly, Mr. Bray.

05:58.576 --> 05:59.909
I know, but

05:59.944 --> 06:01.711
some of the small bones
are still missing.

06:01.746 --> 06:03.212
Phalanges from the fourth
and fifth digits,

06:03.248 --> 06:05.781
and bone fragments
from the skull.

06:05.817 --> 06:07.383
Maybe Bertha struck again.

06:07.418 --> 06:09.785
You think rain temporarily
flooded the crime scene?

06:09.821 --> 06:11.354
If there was enough water,

06:11.389 --> 06:13.189
it could have washed
some of the bones downstream.

06:13.224 --> 06:14.423
Man...

06:14.459 --> 06:16.792
if only you had an expert in

06:16.828 --> 06:19.128
forensics and earth sciences

06:19.164 --> 06:21.531
who could totally tell you
exactly where those bones were.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.500
You can help us.

06:24.536 --> 06:26.669
Yes.
But this doesn't

06:26.704 --> 06:28.037
mean you're back at work.

06:30.108 --> 06:32.909
<i>The woman you are</i>
<i>describing to me</i>

06:32.944 --> 06:34.343
is Andrea Torres.

06:34.379 --> 06:37.313
Drea. This is her
confirmation necklace.

06:37.348 --> 06:39.215
She was stabbed
over a year ago.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.750
Yes.

06:40.785 --> 06:43.152
I sat with her at the hospital
after it happened.

06:43.188 --> 06:44.820
Father,
is it possible that the

06:44.856 --> 06:47.557
person who stabbed her came back
around to finish the job?

06:47.592 --> 06:48.991
No, he wasn't a killer.

06:49.027 --> 06:50.493
He was her client.

06:50.528 --> 06:52.061
He was mentally ill,

06:52.096 --> 06:53.396
and instead of pressing charges

06:53.431 --> 06:54.830
Drea got him into treatment.

06:54.866 --> 06:57.500
What kind of work did she do?

06:57.535 --> 07:00.236
Drea was an attorney with
the public defender's office.

07:00.271 --> 07:01.504
Hmm, she represented felons.

07:01.539 --> 07:03.439
That's going to be
a long list of suspects.

07:03.474 --> 07:07.643
She defended those who lacked
the means to defend themselves.

07:07.679 --> 07:10.546
Drea told me once
that she thought

07:10.582 --> 07:12.248
if Christ were alive today,

07:12.283 --> 07:13.950
he would be a public defender.

07:13.985 --> 07:16.452
Well, actually, given his low
socioeconomic status,

07:16.487 --> 07:19.188
it is highly improbable

07:19.224 --> 07:21.757
he would have been able
to afford law school.

07:21.793 --> 07:23.025
Bones.

07:23.061 --> 07:24.961
It's true.

07:24.996 --> 07:27.930
How can something so ugly
happen to someone so good?

07:30.602 --> 07:31.867
So, this is our victim,
Drea Torres?

07:31.903 --> 07:34.170
Yeah, the photo
was taken from her ID

07:34.205 --> 07:35.504
at the public
defender's office.

07:35.540 --> 07:37.240
Angela, love of my life,

07:37.275 --> 07:39.976
were you able to finish that,
uh, simulation I asked for?

07:40.011 --> 07:42.178
Dr. Hodgins and I have used
topographical maps

07:42.213 --> 07:44.146
and extrapolated weights
from the missing bones

07:44.182 --> 07:45.448
to determine their
possible location.

07:45.483 --> 07:47.583
Sounds like a lot of work.

07:47.619 --> 07:49.452
Hey, it was well worth it.

07:50.722 --> 07:52.555
I feel fine.

07:52.590 --> 07:55.224
You know, I should have
refused to do this.

07:55.260 --> 07:57.093
But you didn't because
you love solving cases

07:57.128 --> 07:59.395
and you love me so much.

08:00.698 --> 08:02.265
And because we all agreed
to the rules:

08:02.300 --> 08:04.200
once those bones are recovered,
you go home.

08:04.235 --> 08:06.402
Yeah, okay.

08:06.437 --> 08:09.572
So, Bertha's rainfall raised
the water line of interest

08:09.607 --> 08:12.858
by approximately four inches,
just enough to lift and carry

08:12.894 --> 08:14.226
the loose bones and fragments.

08:14.262 --> 08:15.494
How far are we talking?

08:15.530 --> 08:16.529
Well, the water was at peak

08:16.564 --> 08:17.930
overfill for 12 hours.

08:17.966 --> 08:19.231
Moving the bones a distance

08:19.267 --> 08:20.933
of 84 feet.

08:20.969 --> 08:23.102
And they stopped here

08:23.137 --> 08:27.373
where the flood water reached
its topographical base point.

08:27.408 --> 08:29.175
Thank you, Hodgins.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.943
I'll send someone out
to retrieve them.

08:30.979 --> 08:33.546
Great. Bones located.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.246
Husband home to rest.

08:35.283 --> 08:36.315
Uh, I need to be there.

08:36.351 --> 08:37.582
Absolutely not.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.751
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack?

08:38.785 --> 08:41.053
I know what to look for.

08:41.089 --> 08:43.039
I mean, they may have been
ground into sediment or...

08:43.073 --> 08:46.175
Honey, your wheelchair won't
make it in that hat mud.

08:52.050 --> 08:53.616
Right.

08:53.651 --> 08:56.118
Yeah, no, okay.

08:56.154 --> 08:58.020
But I know I can still help.

09:00.425 --> 09:02.892
<i>Torres was top</i>
<i>of her class at Georgetown Law.</i>

09:02.927 --> 09:04.660
She could have worked
anywhere she wanted.

09:04.696 --> 09:05.828
She picked a place like this?

09:05.863 --> 09:07.196
I think it's admirable.

09:07.231 --> 09:08.664
Hey, you work around here?

09:08.700 --> 09:10.132
Tim Watkins.

09:10.168 --> 09:12.368
I'm the intern/I.T. support/
investigator.

09:12.403 --> 09:14.036
A lot of slashes.
A lot of jobs.

09:14.072 --> 09:15.137
Do you have an appointment?

09:15.173 --> 09:16.372
Don't need one.
See that? FBI.

09:16.407 --> 09:17.773
We're looking for the
senior public defender,

09:17.809 --> 09:19.575
Alex Pollack.

09:19.610 --> 09:21.377
Yeah, yes, sir. Yeah.
Let's go.

09:23.614 --> 09:27.950
Sorry, Mr. Pollack, these FBI
agents wanted to see you.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.452
Okay, now, I'd like to ask you

09:29.487 --> 09:31.153
some questions about
Drea Torres.

09:31.189 --> 09:32.488
Is Drea okay?

09:32.523 --> 09:36.225
Um, sorry to say,
she's been murdered.

09:40.031 --> 09:41.163
Can we talk in private?

09:41.199 --> 09:43.232
Uh, yeah, uh, Tim...

09:43.267 --> 09:45.801
excu-excuse us, please.

09:48.139 --> 09:50.373
I tried calling Drea
this morning.

09:50.408 --> 09:51.648
I-I... When she didn't come in,

09:51.676 --> 09:53.409
I thought she was taking
a personal day.

09:53.444 --> 09:54.944
Does she skip work often?

09:54.979 --> 09:57.279
No, but she'd lost a case
on Friday

09:57.315 --> 09:58.748
that she was sure
she was gonna win.

09:58.783 --> 10:00.616
Drea takes these things hard.

10:00.651 --> 10:02.952
When was the last
time you saw her?

10:02.987 --> 10:05.221
Uh, Friday evening. Here.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.189
How would you describe
your relationship with her?

10:07.225 --> 10:08.491
I mean, it's a close office.

10:08.526 --> 10:10.793
It's-it's long hours.

10:10.828 --> 10:13.362
Did you spend any of those long
hours alone with her?

10:13.398 --> 10:16.599
Whoa, we were-- we were not
in a relationship,

10:16.634 --> 10:18.334
if that's what you're implying.

10:18.369 --> 10:21.871
I mean, 90% of our time was
spent talking about our cases.

10:21.906 --> 10:23.105
Then, you would know
if she had any clients

10:23.141 --> 10:24.874
that were especially
dissatisfied

10:24.909 --> 10:26.409
or prone to violence.

10:26.444 --> 10:29.912
I mean, many of our clients
had violent histories,

10:29.947 --> 10:31.580
but no one stands out.

10:31.616 --> 10:34.016
Well, we're going to need her
computer and all her case files.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.551
Of course.

10:35.586 --> 10:37.953
Anything you need.

10:40.558 --> 10:42.792
<i>Drea Torres</i>

10:42.827 --> 10:44.260
was a talented, young attorney,

10:44.295 --> 10:46.562
and we're all invested
in finding her killer.

10:46.597 --> 10:49.198
Great. Well, I've
separated Torres' cases

10:49.233 --> 10:52.101
into wins, losses, plea deals.

10:52.136 --> 10:53.736
Most criminal cases
plead out.

10:53.771 --> 10:55.871
We should start
with the cases she lost.

10:55.907 --> 10:57.807
No plea deal means
higher stakes,

10:57.842 --> 11:00.876
which means stronger
motive for murder.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.213
You're in a different
solar system.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.614
What's on your mind?

11:05.650 --> 11:07.950
Oh, yeah, Booth, uh, told me

11:07.985 --> 11:10.319
that Hodgins came back
to work today.

11:10.354 --> 11:12.221
So soon. Good for him.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.556
It's just I can't stop thinking

11:13.591 --> 11:15.624
about him in that wheelchair,
you know.

11:15.660 --> 11:19.128
Dr. Hodgins will watch his son
grow up, thanks to you.

11:19.163 --> 11:20.529
You're a hero.

11:20.565 --> 11:22.064
And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

11:23.401 --> 11:24.733
Don't test me.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.240
Notice something odd
about this one?

11:31.275 --> 11:33.008
Carla Ashbury.

11:33.044 --> 11:34.677
Convicted of grand theft.

11:34.712 --> 11:36.078
11 years in prison.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.414
After she was arrested,
she posted bail and ran.

11:38.449 --> 11:41.217
Torres absolutely should have
taken a plea.

11:41.252 --> 11:44.119
Carla's been in prison
for the last few months,

11:44.155 --> 11:48.057
so she can't be our killer,
but her husband D'Shawn

11:48.092 --> 11:50.426
has got quite the record.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.895
Including assault
with a deadly weapon.

11:52.930 --> 11:55.130
If he blames Torres for his wife

11:55.166 --> 11:56.166
being sent away...

11:56.200 --> 11:57.933
We need to talk to this guy.

12:00.909 --> 12:02.459
Test, test.

12:03.066 --> 12:05.743
Hey, Wendell.
Camera's upside down,

12:05.744 --> 12:07.177
but other than that
you're looking good.

12:07.212 --> 12:08.244
I look ridiculous.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.446
Yeah, you do.

12:09.481 --> 12:11.114
Okay, you're not the show there,
brother,

12:11.149 --> 12:12.682
so go ahead and attach that
camera to the helmet.

12:12.718 --> 12:15.118
All right. Camera attached.

12:15.153 --> 12:16.153
Now, you're going to

12:16.188 --> 12:17.987
want to turn on those lamps.

12:18.023 --> 12:19.756
Good.

12:19.791 --> 12:21.491
That's going to cause
the bones to fluoresce.

12:21.526 --> 12:23.226
Fluorescing bones, got it.

12:23.261 --> 12:24.694
Now, by my calculations
the bones

12:24.730 --> 12:27.364
should be within, like,
a three-foot radius

12:27.399 --> 12:28.531
of where you're standing.

12:28.567 --> 12:30.300
Hmm, nada so far.

12:30.335 --> 12:33.269
The decline appears to be
steeper than I extrapolated

12:33.305 --> 12:35.004
from the satellite image.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.040
So, the bones traveled farther
than you calculated.

12:37.075 --> 12:38.575
Yeah...

12:38.610 --> 12:40.210
by about 18 feet and, like,

12:40.245 --> 12:43.880
30-degree shift to your right.

12:43.915 --> 12:45.181
Okay, just be careful
that you don't...

12:45.217 --> 12:47.283
Oop, whoopsie-do!

12:47.319 --> 12:50.153
...fall.

12:50.188 --> 12:51.588
Enjoying yourself, Hodgins?

12:51.623 --> 12:54.190
Yeah, I really am.

12:54.226 --> 12:56.993
Okay, just going to get up...

12:57.028 --> 12:58.962
Hey, hey, w-w-w-whoa,
w-w-w-wait.

12:58.997 --> 13:01.097
Don't move, don't move.
I think I saw something there.

13:01.133 --> 13:02.932
Where? The grate?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:02.968 --> 13:04.667
Hey, the bones may
have washed through

13:04.703 --> 13:06.169
and gotten hung up
in that debris.

13:06.204 --> 13:07.303
Can you reach in there?

13:07.339 --> 13:09.472
What if there's an animal
in there?

13:09.508 --> 13:11.508
Dude, that's half the fun.

13:13.879 --> 13:15.979
Yeah, there.

13:16.014 --> 13:17.714
Right there.

13:17.749 --> 13:18.749
Wendell...

13:18.784 --> 13:20.450
you got it.

13:20.485 --> 13:22.352
Hey, Hodgins...

13:22.387 --> 13:25.088
king of the lab.

13:27.092 --> 13:29.025
Yeah.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.327
King of the lab.

13:33.098 --> 13:34.731
<i>Look, I did my time.</i>

13:34.766 --> 13:36.599
I'm working,
taking care of my kids.

13:36.635 --> 13:37.834
So, why am I here?

13:37.869 --> 13:39.903
What can you tell me
about Drea Torres?

13:39.938 --> 13:41.805
Who, the lawyer?

13:41.840 --> 13:43.406
Why we talking about Ms. Torres?

13:43.442 --> 13:45.008
She was murdered three days ago.

13:48.079 --> 13:50.113
Look, I had no problem with her.
Really?

13:50.148 --> 13:51.381
Because your wife is in jail

13:51.416 --> 13:53.817
because Drea Torres
lost her case.

13:53.852 --> 13:55.685
If she'd pled down,
she'd be out by Christmas.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.720
Ms. Torres asked us
to take the plea,

13:57.756 --> 14:00.890
but Carla refused
because she didn't do it.

14:00.926 --> 14:03.593
Oh, come on, I've heard that
once or twice, my friend.

14:03.628 --> 14:05.428
You know, my wife and I
had decent jobs.

14:05.464 --> 14:06.930
Our kids were happy.

14:06.965 --> 14:09.566
And we actually thought
we could have a good life.

14:09.601 --> 14:11.067
Until one of Carla's employers

14:11.102 --> 14:13.703
accused her of, uh,
cleaning out the cash drawer.

14:13.738 --> 14:15.538
Yeah, they assumed the woman

14:15.574 --> 14:17.874
with the record must
have done it.

14:17.909 --> 14:20.009
Kind of like how you assumed
the guy with the record

14:20.045 --> 14:21.911
is the one who killed
Ms. Torres?

14:21.947 --> 14:25.081
She was the reason why your wife
is in prison for 11 years.

14:25.116 --> 14:27.250
Ms. Torres actually believed
my wife.

14:27.285 --> 14:28.585
She listened to her,

14:28.620 --> 14:31.421
and she let Carla decide
how she wanted to fight.

14:31.456 --> 14:33.323
Where were you Friday night?

14:33.358 --> 14:36.092
One of my kids was sick.

14:36.127 --> 14:39.195
I spent the night
in the emergency room.

14:39.231 --> 14:42.131
And I got no idea
how I'm gonna pay for it.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.107
Guess what I've got.
Mr. Bray.

14:51.142 --> 14:54.110
I take it from your
self-congratulatory expression,

14:54.145 --> 14:55.545
you have found
the missing bones.

14:55.580 --> 14:56.613
I did.

14:56.648 --> 14:58.081
We-we did.

14:58.116 --> 14:59.116
Hodgins did.

14:59.150 --> 15:01.651
Well done.
I have identified

15:01.686 --> 15:03.786
oblique fractures
of the radii and ulnae,

15:03.822 --> 15:06.956
as well as the tibiae
and the left fibula.

15:06.992 --> 15:08.958
Are the axes of the fractures
consistent?

15:08.994 --> 15:12.228
Yes, suggesting they were
all caused by impact

15:12.264 --> 15:14.097
from the same object.

15:14.132 --> 15:16.733
The directionality
of the fractures

15:16.768 --> 15:19.836
indicates they occur
along a straight line.

15:19.871 --> 15:23.640
Which makes it very likely they
were caused by a single impact.

15:23.675 --> 15:25.642
This fracture appears
to be linear in shape

15:25.677 --> 15:26.910
and approximately...

15:26.945 --> 15:28.845
three millimeters deep.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.215
And Hodgins found particulates
of steel alloy.

15:32.250 --> 15:35.985
Well, the murder weapon could be
a length of steel pipe.

15:36.021 --> 15:38.621
What if he stayed?

15:38.657 --> 15:40.123
Dr. Hodgins?

15:41.092 --> 15:43.927
Dr. Saroyan is of the opinion

15:43.962 --> 15:45.929
that it is detrimental
to his recovery.

15:45.964 --> 15:48.698
I know, but what if it's more
detrimental for him

15:48.733 --> 15:51.701
to stay home thinking about
everything he can't do?

15:51.736 --> 15:53.937
There's no quantitative method

15:53.972 --> 15:55.705
for evaluating such a question.

15:56.975 --> 15:58.975
I just don't want him
to give up.

15:59.010 --> 16:00.710
When I was diagnosed
with Ewing's sarcoma,

16:00.745 --> 16:02.745
Booth told me giving up
wasn't an option.

16:02.781 --> 16:04.347
That I had to fight.

16:04.382 --> 16:06.516
That metaphorical concept
will not give Dr. Hodgins

16:06.551 --> 16:07.850
the use of his legs.

16:07.886 --> 16:10.453
In fact, he may be offended
by the very idea

16:10.488 --> 16:13.990
that he can fight his nerves
back into growing,

16:14.025 --> 16:16.025
given the extreme unlikeliness
of recovery.

16:16.061 --> 16:18.428
My recovery
was extremely unlikely...

16:18.463 --> 16:19.729
but it happened.

16:19.764 --> 16:22.765
And I'm happy for that,

16:22.801 --> 16:25.835
but it has nothing to do
with Dr. Hodgins.

16:30.709 --> 16:32.442
How's it coming with
the victim's computer?

16:32.477 --> 16:36.212
Well, Drea Torres had
no social media accounts.

16:36.247 --> 16:39.182
There's no history of her
ever even visiting the sites.

16:39.217 --> 16:40.984
Well, that's odd
for someone her age.

16:41.019 --> 16:43.486
Well, given her clientele,
I can understand why

16:43.521 --> 16:45.088
she'd want to keep
her life private.

16:45.123 --> 16:46.522
Yeah.

16:46.558 --> 16:47.890
Is it possible
that she would

16:47.926 --> 16:50.226
have accessed the sites
from another device?

16:50.261 --> 16:53.529
Hmm, let me see
what I can find.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.735
You're sticking with
what you said, right?

16:58.770 --> 17:00.203
Hodgins is done now.

17:00.238 --> 17:02.605
It's going to be hard
to have that conversation.

17:02.641 --> 17:04.073
He's been through so much.

17:04.108 --> 17:05.875
It's been hard for me,
too, you know.

17:05.910 --> 17:07.977
Oh, of course.
I didn't mean...

17:08.012 --> 17:11.481
Two months ago,
we were making all these plans.

17:11.516 --> 17:14.483
We were talking
about having more kids.

17:14.519 --> 17:16.886
Oh, man, I had no idea.

17:16.921 --> 17:19.288
It's just, all of this
has been hard enough,

17:19.324 --> 17:23.259
and I-I-I don't want to see
him suffer another setback.

17:23.294 --> 17:24.394
I hear you.

17:24.429 --> 17:26.229
I'll talk to him.

17:26.263 --> 17:30.033
Okay, uh...
there seems to be

17:30.068 --> 17:32.635
an e-mail address
for a Dee Torres.

17:32.671 --> 17:34.037
It's associated with
a social media account.

17:34.072 --> 17:35.538
An alias.

17:35.573 --> 17:37.573
Talk about keeping your
private life private.

17:37.609 --> 17:40.309
Yeah, I'll override
the password request.

17:42.313 --> 17:44.380
Oh, look at this comment.

17:44.416 --> 17:46.683
"Are you okay?
Last night was scary.

17:46.718 --> 17:49.118
I'm so sorry that
happened to you."

17:49.154 --> 17:50.253
What can you find out

17:50.288 --> 17:51.721
about the friend
that posted this?

17:51.756 --> 17:53.623
Kelsey Whitney.

17:54.726 --> 17:56.959
She's from Rockville, Maryland,

17:56.995 --> 17:58.795
and that's Drea's hometown.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.797
Can you send this
info to Aubrey?

18:00.832 --> 18:01.964
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.101
And, uh, I will
talk to Hodgins.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.073
I can't believe
she's gone.

18:10.108 --> 18:12.442
She was my best friend
since we were five.

18:12.477 --> 18:14.577
You sent her a message
on Thursday:

18:14.612 --> 18:15.978
"Last night was scary."

18:16.014 --> 18:17.014
What was that about?

18:17.048 --> 18:18.548
Oh, that was scary.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.049
We were out for drinks,

18:20.085 --> 18:21.884
and this woman up and
picked a fight with Drea.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.120
Had Drea done anything
to the woman?

18:24.155 --> 18:26.155
She thought Drea was making fun
of her for being drunk

18:26.191 --> 18:27.156
and she got mad.

18:27.192 --> 18:28.491
She started shoving Drea.

18:28.526 --> 18:29.625
Were the police called?

18:29.661 --> 18:30.927
No, the drunk woman

18:30.962 --> 18:32.161
told the bartender
not to call them.

18:32.197 --> 18:33.663
Wow, and he listened?

18:33.698 --> 18:35.164
She flashed some badge.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.734
Drea told me she
was a lawyer, too.

18:37.769 --> 18:39.802
You remember what
the badge said?

18:39.838 --> 18:42.171
I saw letters... A.U.S.A.

18:42.207 --> 18:43.639
Why?

18:43.675 --> 18:46.943
Would you recognize this
woman if you saw a photo?

18:46.978 --> 18:49.078
Definitely.

18:51.282 --> 18:53.783
Just the swashbuckler
I was looking for.

18:53.818 --> 18:55.952
Oh, let me guess, you want
in on this interrogation?

18:55.987 --> 18:58.254
What I want is
a dry vodka martini,

18:58.289 --> 19:00.423
but you're about to question
Vanessa Caldwell.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.058
One of your prosecutors.

19:02.093 --> 19:03.192
Been with us for three years.

19:03.228 --> 19:05.128
That woman takes her job
seriously.

19:05.163 --> 19:06.896
Well, she also had a
well-documented rivalry

19:06.931 --> 19:08.798
with our victim. You think
Caldwell could have killed her?

19:08.833 --> 19:12.235
<i>Cher,</i> that woman made it to the
Olympic trials for shot put.

19:12.270 --> 19:15.004
Only thing bigger than her
deltoids is her temper.

19:15.039 --> 19:17.340
There's also this,
which may prove helpful.

19:17.375 --> 19:18.741
Can you hold
that for a second?

19:18.777 --> 19:20.343
Thanks,
you coming or going?

19:20.378 --> 19:22.678
It's not a martini.

19:22.714 --> 19:24.947
This your idea of a joke,
Caroline?

19:24.983 --> 19:26.449
No, Vanessa,
my jokes are funny.

19:26.484 --> 19:27.784
Nothing funny
about this.

19:27.819 --> 19:29.485
Okay, look, what
did Drea Torres do

19:29.521 --> 19:31.287
that made you so angry
at her Wednesday night?

19:31.322 --> 19:33.456
I had a few drinks.

19:33.491 --> 19:35.758
She ran her mouth about how
I couldn't handle my alcohol.

19:35.794 --> 19:36.759
I shut her up.

19:36.795 --> 19:38.394
End of story.
All right.

19:38.429 --> 19:40.530
What can you tell me
about <i>State v. Morrison?</i>

19:41.633 --> 19:43.099
I was going to
prosecute that case,

19:43.134 --> 19:45.601
but there was a
scheduling conflict.

19:45.637 --> 19:48.237
Pardon my French, but that is
a steaming heap of bullcrap.

19:48.273 --> 19:50.239
You got passed over
for an attorney

19:50.275 --> 19:51.674
with a better record.

19:51.709 --> 19:52.975
You-you lost four cases
to her last year.

19:53.011 --> 19:54.477
So?

19:54.512 --> 19:55.478
She gave you the reputation

19:55.513 --> 19:57.113
of a prosecutor that chokes.

19:57.148 --> 19:58.748
All these years
after law school,

19:58.783 --> 19:59.916
and still she beat you.

19:59.951 --> 20:02.251
Fine! I hated Drea Torres.

20:02.287 --> 20:04.220
She thought she was
Mother Teresa serving the poor.

20:04.255 --> 20:05.421
It pissed me off.

20:05.456 --> 20:06.789
You're right about the temper.

20:06.825 --> 20:08.090
So, arrest me then, huh?

20:08.126 --> 20:09.358
I worked late Friday night.

20:09.394 --> 20:11.327
You can check
with building security.

20:11.362 --> 20:13.095
I didn't kill
the precious angel.

20:17.168 --> 20:19.168
Dr. Hodgin...

20:19.204 --> 20:21.137
Hey.

20:21.172 --> 20:23.539
Wh... You were supposed
to be going home.

20:23.575 --> 20:24.740
What is all of this?

20:24.776 --> 20:26.976
This is the solution
to our problem.

20:27.011 --> 20:28.144
It's electronic.

20:28.179 --> 20:29.478
Moves my legs for me.

20:29.514 --> 20:30.847
Look, no hands.

20:32.483 --> 20:34.317
Hey, you wanted me to focus
on my recovery.

20:34.352 --> 20:35.352
I want to work.

20:35.386 --> 20:36.819
Well, now I can do both.

20:36.855 --> 20:38.654
No, doing physical therapy

20:38.690 --> 20:41.424
at work without a therapist
only increases your risk

20:41.459 --> 20:43.125
and my liability.

20:43.161 --> 20:45.294
You gonna get that?

20:45.330 --> 20:47.129
That may be a new lead

20:47.165 --> 20:49.098
we need to pursue.

20:52.070 --> 20:55.471
Oh, it's the results
from the toxicology report.

20:55.506 --> 20:57.640
Drea Torres had cocaine
in her system.

20:57.675 --> 20:59.942
Cocaine? Huh.

20:59.978 --> 21:01.744
So much for being an angel,
right?

21:01.779 --> 21:03.579
All right.

21:03.615 --> 21:05.314
I'm going to swab
for more evidence.

21:05.350 --> 21:06.515
Please don't do that.

21:06.551 --> 21:08.284
I may be able to trace
the origin of the cocaine.

21:08.319 --> 21:09.319
I meant what I said.

21:09.354 --> 21:10.620
There could be particulates

21:10.655 --> 21:11.787
in her nasal cavity
that we missed...

21:11.823 --> 21:12.823
Dr. Hodgins, no.

21:12.857 --> 21:15.391
You are off this case.

21:16.427 --> 21:18.961
Please don't do that, Cam.

21:18.997 --> 21:21.097
I-I need to be here.

21:21.132 --> 21:22.331
It's who I am.

21:22.367 --> 21:25.601
You are so much more
than this job.

21:25.637 --> 21:28.471
And I have to look out for you
if you won't.

21:28.506 --> 21:31.674
So you may no longer assist
in this investigation.

22:01.748 --> 22:03.961
<i>Look, you know</i>
<i>how this works, Alex.</i>

22:03.962 --> 22:06.199
Why didn't you tell us
that Drea did drugs?

22:06.200 --> 22:08.267
Well, I never saw her use drugs.

22:08.302 --> 22:09.868
That wasn't my question.

22:09.904 --> 22:11.370
Look, are you willing to swear
that you didn't know?

22:11.405 --> 22:12.971
'Cause we got her e-mails.

22:14.108 --> 22:17.476
She said it was only
once in a while.

22:17.511 --> 22:19.011
So, you let a known drug user

22:19.046 --> 22:20.345
work in your office

22:20.381 --> 22:21.580
defending clients.

22:21.615 --> 22:24.683
It wasn't right,
but I understood.

22:24.718 --> 22:27.319
If she lost a case,
a family got broken up

22:27.354 --> 22:30.155
or a child's hopes
for the future destroyed.

22:30.191 --> 22:32.090
She needed an outlet.
We all do.

22:32.126 --> 22:33.625
You seem busy.

22:33.661 --> 22:35.661
I'm in the middle of prepping
a case.

22:35.696 --> 22:37.396
Really?
What's that? Oh.

22:37.431 --> 22:38.897
William Howell?

22:38.933 --> 22:40.299
Big one.

22:40.334 --> 22:41.533
Which is why you shouldn't
read another word,

22:41.569 --> 22:42.768
unless you want to compromise

22:42.803 --> 22:43.702
the government's case.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.803
Good call.

22:44.838 --> 22:46.939
Thank you for that.
Uh-huh.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.174
Hey, listen, just, uh,
one more question.

22:49.210 --> 22:51.910
Where did Drea get her drugs?

22:51.946 --> 22:53.345
I wouldn't know.

22:53.380 --> 22:56.448
Alex, you're a material witness
in this case.

22:56.483 --> 22:58.917
I'll just keep asking
you questions

22:58.953 --> 23:02.187
until you remember.

23:02.223 --> 23:04.523
She used to get them
from some DJ.

23:04.558 --> 23:06.091
I swear I don't
know anything

23:06.126 --> 23:07.259
more than that.

23:07.294 --> 23:08.594
Okay.

23:08.629 --> 23:10.362
Thanks for your help.

23:15.069 --> 23:16.902
You wanted to see me?

23:16.937 --> 23:19.304
Yeah, I reexamined
our victim's nasal tissue,

23:19.340 --> 23:20.606
looking for evidence
of degradation.

23:20.641 --> 23:21.840
There wasn't any.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.609
So she wasn't a frequent
drug user.

23:23.644 --> 23:25.644
But I found this.

23:25.679 --> 23:27.613
A cell of some sort.

23:27.648 --> 23:28.847
Yeah, but not human.

23:28.882 --> 23:30.849
We couldn't just ask Hodgins
what it is?

23:30.884 --> 23:33.352
That would defeat the purpose
of taking him off the case,

23:33.387 --> 23:35.053
wouldn't it?

23:35.089 --> 23:37.122
But this could tell us where
she was or who she was with

23:37.157 --> 23:38.357
when she died.

23:38.392 --> 23:39.891
I know.

23:39.927 --> 23:41.893
Perhaps
one of the biologists

23:41.929 --> 23:43.795
here at the Jeffersonian
can help us.

23:43.831 --> 23:46.331
I'll take it to them.

23:49.703 --> 23:51.670
Hey, honey.

23:51.705 --> 23:53.772
Wow, it looks like
all the physical therapy

23:53.807 --> 23:55.107
equipment arrived.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.009
Yup. Rehabilitation.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.510
It's all the rage around here.

23:58.545 --> 24:00.178
And the physical therapist
should be on her way.

24:00.214 --> 24:02.247
Can't wait.

24:02.283 --> 24:05.517
Uh, Brennan examined the bones
that you located in the culvert.

24:05.552 --> 24:07.019
Uh, apparently

24:07.054 --> 24:09.755
the victim suffered
microfracturing in her hand.

24:09.790 --> 24:12.057
She must have punched
the attacker.

24:12.092 --> 24:15.560
Angela, I-I know that you
feel bad that you're there

24:15.596 --> 24:17.929
and I'm here, but, like,
talking about the case...

24:17.965 --> 24:19.965
it's-it's-it's not
really helping.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.801
It's kind of making it worse.

24:23.904 --> 24:25.971
Okay, um, sorry.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.707
I'm-I'm just trying to do
the right thing

24:28.742 --> 24:30.208
for-for all of us.

24:30.244 --> 24:31.743
I know, I know.

24:31.779 --> 24:35.547
Um, anyway, I'm going to go
and I'll see you later.

24:41.155 --> 24:43.422
<i>Wendell was actually able</i>

24:43.457 --> 24:46.591
to identify the particulate
I found in the nasal passage.

24:46.627 --> 24:49.628
It was part of a scale
from a woma python.

24:49.663 --> 24:51.063
Wait a second.
The woman had a snake scale

24:51.098 --> 24:52.564
and cocaine in her nose?

24:52.599 --> 24:53.832
How does that even happen?

24:53.867 --> 24:57.836
It's likely she just
inhaled the molted scale

24:57.871 --> 24:59.137
like any other pet dander.

24:59.173 --> 25:00.839
Well, anything's possible.

25:00.874 --> 25:03.008
Boy, Hodgins would have been
all over something like that.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.176
Yeah.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.611
But I sent him home.

25:06.647 --> 25:08.213
I just... I had to.

25:08.248 --> 25:09.948
Are you sure about that?

25:09.983 --> 25:12.250
It was the only responsible
thing to do.

25:12.286 --> 25:14.286
Hodgins didn't have a choice
about what happened to him.

25:14.321 --> 25:17.456
You should let him decide how
he's going to come back from it.

25:17.491 --> 25:19.791
I couldn't forgive myself
if anything more

25:19.827 --> 25:21.526
were to happen to him.
I-I get that.

25:21.562 --> 25:23.128
But, you know, he should
at least have the choice.

25:23.163 --> 25:26.198
I mean, work could actually
give him hope.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.134
I do not understand why
you think Hodgins needs

25:29.169 --> 25:32.270
a misguided sense of optimism
about his condition.

25:34.742 --> 25:37.008
It's Aubrey.

25:37.044 --> 25:39.678
Yeah, I had him check
with woma python breeders

25:39.713 --> 25:41.146
for customers who could be

25:41.181 --> 25:42.247
a potential match for your DJ.

25:42.282 --> 25:43.248
Yeah, he got one.

25:43.283 --> 25:45.984
Chad Jameson, aka DJ Woma.

25:46.019 --> 25:47.619
Oh, the pet python
and the name

25:47.654 --> 25:49.354
leave very little
room for ambiguity.

25:49.390 --> 25:51.790
Oh, he also has a few
outstanding drug charges.

25:51.825 --> 25:53.625
Sounds like the DJ
you're looking for.

25:56.063 --> 25:58.563
What happened to your face
there, Chad?

25:58.599 --> 26:00.165
Drea Torres give you that?

26:00.200 --> 26:02.567
Who? I don't know
any Drea Torres.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.404
Come on, you two left
the Macavoy Club together.

26:05.439 --> 26:06.705
I got eyewitnesses.

26:06.740 --> 26:08.073
Fine. I walked out of a club

26:08.108 --> 26:10.041
at the same time as her, so?

26:10.077 --> 26:12.544
So, a scale from a woma python
ended up with Torres

26:12.579 --> 26:14.079
the night she died.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.947
You own a woma python.
So, you're going away

26:15.983 --> 26:17.315
for murder if you don't
start talking.

26:17.351 --> 26:19.084
Okay.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.653
Okay. We left together
on Friday night.

26:21.688 --> 26:22.587
And went where?

26:22.623 --> 26:24.055
Back to my place.

26:24.091 --> 26:25.624
We messed around.

26:25.659 --> 26:27.392
I...

26:27.428 --> 26:29.594
I got a little pushy.

26:29.630 --> 26:30.896
Sometimes she liked that.

26:30.931 --> 26:32.130
But not this time?

26:32.166 --> 26:34.065
No, because...

26:34.101 --> 26:35.967
I broke a stupid necklace
of hers.

26:36.003 --> 26:37.369
She got really mad.

26:37.404 --> 26:39.271
She hauled off
and she sucker-punched me.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.606
Must've made you angry,
getting hit like that.

26:41.642 --> 26:44.776
I know how to control myself,
okay?

26:44.812 --> 26:47.446
Once she hit me, I was like,
"You got to go."

26:47.481 --> 26:48.747
And-and she left.

26:48.782 --> 26:50.682
Convenient for you.

26:50.717 --> 26:52.417
It's the truth.

26:52.453 --> 26:53.585
I tried to call her a cab.

26:53.620 --> 26:55.554
She said no.
She said she could walk.

26:55.589 --> 26:57.889
In your neighborhood
in the middle of the night.

26:57.925 --> 27:00.192
You don't tell Drea Torres
what to do.

27:00.227 --> 27:01.927
Well, you'd better have an
alibi, Chad,

27:01.962 --> 27:04.796
'cause I'll tell you,
you look good for this.

27:04.832 --> 27:07.566
I do have an alibi.

27:07.601 --> 27:09.134
Once Drea left,

27:09.169 --> 27:10.535
I... I was pretty amped up.

27:10.571 --> 27:13.205
I went to the 24-hour diner
down the street.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.173
I was there all night.

27:17.644 --> 27:20.445
Hey, I have something
to show you.

27:20.481 --> 27:24.115
It's a forensic copy of
Drea Torres' hard drive.

27:24.151 --> 27:26.151
It's just going to take
a minute to load.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.353
How's Dr. Hodgins today?

27:28.388 --> 27:30.655
He's not great.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.791
He's unhappy at home,
and then he can't be here.

27:32.826 --> 27:36.328
It's like I'm stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.330
Ah, yes, between Scylla
and Charybdis.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.265
I...

27:40.300 --> 27:42.667
The Greek myth on which
the idiom is based.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.937
Odysseus had to choose
which deadly sea monster

27:45.973 --> 27:48.073
to steer his ship past.

27:48.108 --> 27:51.309
I don't know why I'm asking,
but what did he do?

27:51.345 --> 27:53.011
He takes a calculated risk.

27:53.046 --> 27:57.249
He chooses the lesser of two
evils and forfeits a few men

27:57.284 --> 27:58.917
in order to preserve the ship.

27:58.952 --> 28:02.153
So, what I'm hearing you say
is that there is no version

28:02.189 --> 28:04.990
of us all making it
through this alive?

28:05.893 --> 28:08.693
I'm going to hug you.

28:08.729 --> 28:11.096
Oh, thanks for the heads-up.

28:17.037 --> 28:18.870
What is it you wanted
to show me?

28:18.906 --> 28:20.639
Uh, I created a program

28:20.674 --> 28:23.208
to check Drea's computer
for spyware.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.510
What made you think
there would be spyware?

28:25.546 --> 28:28.313
Well, she never accessed
any social media accounts

28:28.348 --> 28:30.448
from her computer,
so I thought maybe

28:30.484 --> 28:32.384
she felt it wasn't secure.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.085
Very intuitive.
Yeah.

28:34.121 --> 28:37.155
Okay, here we go.

28:37.190 --> 28:38.990
WebSneak?

28:39.026 --> 28:41.626
Someone was watching
Drea Torres online?

28:41.662 --> 28:43.929
Yeah, they had
access to everything.

28:43.964 --> 28:45.263
She was being stalked.

28:45.299 --> 28:47.532
Can you trace the program

28:47.568 --> 28:49.034
back to whomever

28:49.069 --> 28:50.702
put this on
Drea's computer?

28:50.737 --> 28:52.604
I'm definitely going to try.

29:01.830 --> 29:04.902
Tim, you're good
with computers, right?

29:05.126 --> 29:06.631
I-I guess so.

29:06.655 --> 29:07.442
I guess so?

29:07.466 --> 29:08.776
Don't sell youself short.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.311
You're taking coding classes
for years.

29:11.335 --> 29:14.008
Okay, uh, yeah,
I'm good with computers.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.702
So it was no big deal
when you put spyware

29:16.726 --> 29:18.730
on Drea Torres laptop?

29:18.754 --> 29:20.425
Why were you stalking her?

29:20.662 --> 29:21.880
I wasn't.

29:21.881 --> 29:25.016
Oh, right, 'cause you were
in love with her,

29:25.051 --> 29:27.485
so it doesn't count as stalking
when you're in love?

29:27.520 --> 29:30.521
I wasn't in love with her.

29:30.557 --> 29:33.124
I protected her.

29:33.159 --> 29:35.226
It was just to make sure
that she-she was safe.

29:35.261 --> 29:36.828
Safe?

29:36.863 --> 29:38.529
From what, Tim, who?

29:39.633 --> 29:42.667
I-I... I mean, I don't know.

29:42.702 --> 29:45.236
Criminals she represented.

29:45.271 --> 29:47.939
Guys that she... dated.

29:47.974 --> 29:49.107
Is that difficult

29:49.142 --> 29:50.174
for you to talk about?

29:50.210 --> 29:52.010
Drea's romantic life?

29:52.979 --> 29:55.413
I'm not saying anything more.

29:55.448 --> 29:56.748
Come on.

29:56.783 --> 29:59.884
Tim, do it for Drea.

29:59.919 --> 30:03.621
Drea would tell me
to talk to a lawyer.

30:03.657 --> 30:06.591
That's what I'm gonna do,
Agent Aubrey.

30:06.626 --> 30:08.559
I need a lawyer.

30:11.064 --> 30:14.632
I detect a pattern to
the facial fractures.

30:16.036 --> 30:18.936
It appears she suffered
a stellate fracture

30:18.972 --> 30:21.072
on the frontal
and zygomatic bones.

30:21.107 --> 30:22.740
And all the other fractures
radiate outward

30:22.776 --> 30:23.975
from the stellate fracture.

30:24.010 --> 30:25.610
Well, the primary fractures

30:25.645 --> 30:29.447
appear to be positioned
at a right angle.

30:29.482 --> 30:32.917
Which, quite possibly,
relates to the fracturing

30:32.952 --> 30:35.420
of the radii and ulnae.

30:35.455 --> 30:38.756
But the fracture lines
occur at different angles.

30:38.792 --> 30:42.760
Not if the victim raised
her arms alongside her face

30:42.796 --> 30:46.030
at time of impact.

30:46.066 --> 30:50.201
The fractures on the face
and arms appear to line up.

30:50.236 --> 30:52.270
Just like the damage
to the leg bones.

30:52.305 --> 30:53.604
I believe you are correct.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.973
Now, we just need to
find out what caused it.

30:57.210 --> 30:58.843
<i>Tim Watkins knows something</i>

30:58.878 --> 31:00.111
but he refuses to talk.

31:00.146 --> 31:01.979
DJ's alibi
checks out, right?

31:02.015 --> 31:04.148
Oh, yeah, three waitresses
reported seeing him

31:04.184 --> 31:05.416
at the diner that night.

31:05.452 --> 31:06.984
Torres told him that
she could walk back

31:07.020 --> 31:08.519
from his apartment, right?

31:08.555 --> 31:11.322
Yeah. I've got our techs
checking out her contact list

31:11.357 --> 31:13.024
to see if anyone lives
within walking distance.

31:14.561 --> 31:16.094
Right. Coffee?

31:16.129 --> 31:17.862
Not if we're still
out of cinnamon.

31:17.897 --> 31:19.764
We work at the FBI, Aubrey.

31:19.799 --> 31:22.133
We don't put cinnamon
in our coffee.

31:22.168 --> 31:25.603
It's my favorite spice.

31:25.638 --> 31:27.405
Oh, looks like our DJ, Chad,

31:27.440 --> 31:30.241
lives half a mile
from Alex Pollack's.

31:30.276 --> 31:31.542
Senior public defender?

31:31.578 --> 31:32.910
Yeah, I mean, they were close.

31:32.946 --> 31:34.245
That neighborhood,
that time of night.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.646
She must have gone
straight there.

31:35.682 --> 31:37.415
Seems like something
he should have told us.

31:37.450 --> 31:39.417
I'll see if Caroline
can get us a warrant.

31:39.452 --> 31:41.486
Right.

31:41.521 --> 31:44.522
So, this is Alex Pollack's
apartment building.

31:44.557 --> 31:46.057
Now, if Booth is right

31:46.092 --> 31:48.126
and Pollack lied
about seeing her...

31:48.161 --> 31:49.660
Then this could be
our murder scene.

31:49.696 --> 31:51.896
Her skeleton was fractured
in a unique pattern.

31:51.931 --> 31:53.464
It could be

31:53.500 --> 31:55.700
something at Pollack's
that caused the fracturing.

31:55.735 --> 31:56.968
Next to the building,

31:57.003 --> 31:59.804
what is that rectangular
object there?

32:02.308 --> 32:03.708
Oh, it's a Dumpster.

32:03.743 --> 32:05.143
Well, Dr. Hodgins said

32:05.178 --> 32:06.477
there were particulates of steel
in the wounds.

32:06.513 --> 32:08.646
There's a balcony above it.

32:08.681 --> 32:11.249
Pollack's unit is 408.

32:11.284 --> 32:13.184
His balcony is above the alley
where the Dumpster is.

32:13.219 --> 32:16.154
Judging from the fractures
on her facial bones,

32:16.189 --> 32:18.189
she must have hit a corner.

32:18.224 --> 32:19.323
Well, let's look at
all the fractures.

32:19.359 --> 32:21.526
Now's let's see if the fractures

32:21.561 --> 32:26.697
to the arms, tibiae, and fibula
align with the edges.

32:30.904 --> 32:32.069
We have a match.

32:32.105 --> 32:33.538
And we have our crime scene.

32:33.573 --> 32:35.706
I'll let Booth know.

32:40.580 --> 32:42.213
Sure, I mean, being the last
person to see your friend alive,

32:42.248 --> 32:43.915
I mean, that's an
easy thing to forget.

32:43.950 --> 32:45.516
I'm sorry.

32:45.552 --> 32:47.518
I have been scattered prepping
for the Howell case.

32:47.554 --> 32:49.420
She only stayed a few minutes.
Right.

32:49.455 --> 32:51.088
Well, we found blood

32:51.124 --> 32:55.493
in the Dumpster that was
directly under your balcony.

32:55.528 --> 32:57.695
Are you sure that's
Drea's blood?

32:57.730 --> 32:59.130
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't.

32:59.165 --> 33:01.399
If that blood is
several days old,

33:01.434 --> 33:02.900
your sample's compromised.

33:02.936 --> 33:04.435
And that Dumpster's
in a public alley.

33:04.470 --> 33:06.137
Anyone had access.

33:06.172 --> 33:09.273
Right, well, we talked to
your, uh, intern, is it, Tim?

33:09.309 --> 33:12.710
And we heard all about how you,
uh, told him to install

33:12.745 --> 33:14.512
spyware in Drea's computer.

33:14.547 --> 33:16.214
Kid's confused.

33:16.249 --> 33:18.683
I probably expressed concern
for Drea, and he ran with it.

33:18.718 --> 33:20.818
Ask him to take out the garbage,
he cleans the whole office.

33:20.854 --> 33:23.154
You got an answer
for everything, don't you?

33:23.189 --> 33:25.723
You're grasping at straws,
Agent Booth.

33:25.758 --> 33:28.059
How do we know Drea
wasn't depressed

33:28.094 --> 33:29.594
or having a bad reaction
to the drugs?

33:29.629 --> 33:32.029
Oh, what, so she jumped
off your balcony

33:32.065 --> 33:33.631
and you didn't even notice
seeing her?

33:33.666 --> 33:34.699
She could have been a victim

33:34.734 --> 33:36.834
of street crime, or maybe, uh,

33:36.870 --> 33:38.002
an angry client
killed Drea

33:38.037 --> 33:39.704
and is trying to
frame me for it.

33:39.739 --> 33:41.405
There are any number
of possibilities.

33:41.441 --> 33:44.075
This evidence is completely
circumstantial.

33:45.011 --> 33:46.110
<i>Tell me you got</i>

33:46.145 --> 33:47.578
that search warrant,

33:47.614 --> 33:48.980
and we will scour every
inch of his apartment.

33:49.015 --> 33:50.314
He had to have left
something behind.

33:50.350 --> 33:52.817
Not so fast.
The judge refused my request.

33:52.852 --> 33:55.286
Pollack is in the middle
of the William Howell trial.

33:55.321 --> 33:57.121
Oh, he can't also have
committed murder?

33:57.156 --> 33:59.690
Apparently, he took his
case files home to prepare.

33:59.726 --> 34:01.125
And if we conduct a search,

34:01.160 --> 34:03.628
Pollack can get his case
thrown out on the grounds

34:03.663 --> 34:06.030
we violated his attorney-client
privilege.

34:06.065 --> 34:07.565
Caroline, he brought
those files home

34:07.600 --> 34:09.367
to block us from searching
his place.

34:09.402 --> 34:11.202
The fact he went
to all that trouble

34:11.237 --> 34:12.533
says there's something to hide.

34:12.534 --> 34:15.202
He's a sneaky little
word-I-shouldn't-say.

34:15.237 --> 34:17.304
But if Brennan finds hard
evidence that he was with Drea

34:17.339 --> 34:18.804
the night she died
in his apartment...

34:18.841 --> 34:20.440
Then we can play ball, <i>cher.</i>

34:20.476 --> 34:22.542
I really want to play ball.

34:22.578 --> 34:23.844
I'll catch for you.

34:23.879 --> 34:25.445
<i>There are no additional</i>

34:25.481 --> 34:27.347
signs of struggle that
would implicate Pollack,

34:27.382 --> 34:29.516
and wishing really hard
isn't going to make any appear.

34:29.551 --> 34:33.120
I may have found an
irregularity, Mr. Bray.

34:33.155 --> 34:35.554
What do you see here?

34:35.591 --> 34:37.556
A slight nick in proximity

34:37.592 --> 34:39.059
to the left supraorbital
foramen.

34:39.094 --> 34:40.460
It's almost indiscernible

34:40.496 --> 34:42.462
among the teeth marks
and microfractures.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.331
But the shape is not consistent

34:44.366 --> 34:48.135
with rat predation
or the radiating fractures.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.704
It suggests she was struck
by something sharp.

34:50.739 --> 34:53.239
This injury would
have bled heavily,

34:53.275 --> 34:56.643
and yet there is only minimal
hemorrhagic staining.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.311
Indicating it was perimortem.

34:58.347 --> 35:00.447
Please, swab it.

35:00.482 --> 35:03.150
Uh, I can run this

35:03.185 --> 35:04.584
through the Mass Spectrometer,

35:04.620 --> 35:06.683
but without Hodgins to interpret
the results...

35:06.684 --> 35:08.484
You have done excellent
work lately.

35:08.519 --> 35:11.887
Do you think this is enough
to get us a warrant?

35:12.790 --> 35:14.924
It will have to be.

35:17.131 --> 35:20.346
Methoxypyrazines, terpenes,
and rotundone.

35:20.446 --> 35:22.413
Those are all found in grapes.

35:22.448 --> 35:23.514
Hey, honey.

35:23.549 --> 35:25.549
So, I brought home
some of those

35:25.585 --> 35:27.184
conspiracy theory journals

35:27.219 --> 35:29.253
to lift your spirits.

35:29.288 --> 35:30.387
What is this?

35:30.423 --> 35:32.156
You're still working?

35:32.191 --> 35:33.390
Look, I can explain.

35:34.694 --> 35:36.193
I'm guessing this is also

35:36.228 --> 35:38.529
how <i>you</i> identified
the python scales.

35:38.564 --> 35:39.797
Oh.

35:39.832 --> 35:41.832
No one at the Jeffersonian
could do it.

35:41.867 --> 35:44.435
Actually, that was a fun one.
So, the <i>Aspidites ramsayi,</i>

35:44.470 --> 35:46.704
or the-the woma python,
they've got these

35:46.739 --> 35:49.273
scales, and, uh...
Yeah, right.

35:49.308 --> 35:51.976
I know that you're essential
to the team,

35:52.011 --> 35:54.778
I've never doubted that,

35:54.814 --> 35:57.014
but you're also essential to me.

35:57.049 --> 35:59.717
I'll just be over, um...

35:59.752 --> 36:02.453
over-over here.

36:02.488 --> 36:05.723
Angela, what do you love
about me?

36:05.758 --> 36:07.424
So much.

36:07.460 --> 36:10.694
You're passionate and you're...

36:10.730 --> 36:14.331
open-minded and curious.

36:14.367 --> 36:15.866
And you're so smart.

36:15.901 --> 36:20.070
Well, my work at the lab
makes me those things.

36:20.106 --> 36:23.374
And without it,
I don't know how to be

36:23.409 --> 36:25.743
the man that you
fell in love with.

36:25.778 --> 36:28.012
Okay.

36:28.047 --> 36:31.548
Wow, that was...
that was persuasive.

36:31.584 --> 36:34.985
Good, because Wendell and I
found some particulates

36:35.021 --> 36:36.720
that Booth's going to want
to know about.

36:39.091 --> 36:41.325
Mr. Pollack.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.560
Look, Agent Booth, uh,
I have a lot of work to do,

36:43.596 --> 36:44.762
so I don't have time for this.

36:44.797 --> 36:47.398
You're going to
have to make time.

36:47.433 --> 36:48.699
Search warrant.

36:48.734 --> 36:50.734
Well, I need to read that.

36:50.770 --> 36:53.470
All official.
Be my guest.

36:53.506 --> 36:54.438
That is the balcony

36:54.473 --> 36:56.240
from where the victim

36:56.275 --> 36:57.975
presumably fell.
Let's go.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.209
This-this is all conjecture.

36:59.245 --> 37:01.445
I'm just going to call
a judge...

37:01.480 --> 37:04.114
Yeah, I wouldn't do
that just yet.

37:04.150 --> 37:07.084
We found a cut on Drea Torres'
forehead with trace amounts

37:07.119 --> 37:10.521
of Syrah, Viognier,
and Cabernet Franc grapes.

37:10.556 --> 37:12.589
See, our techs, they scoured
the local stores.

37:12.625 --> 37:13.891
Well, it's wasted effort.

37:13.926 --> 37:16.026
I mean, those are
common types of wine.

37:16.062 --> 37:17.194
But this precise blend of grapes

37:17.229 --> 37:19.129
is unique to
the St. George Syrah.

37:19.165 --> 37:20.464
Okay, you bought a bottle

37:20.499 --> 37:21.699
of it last Friday.

37:21.734 --> 37:23.200
Booth.

37:23.235 --> 37:24.802
He painted the railing.

37:24.837 --> 37:26.437
It was gray in
the satellite image.

37:26.472 --> 37:28.706
Take a look.
Ah, you, have a seat.

37:28.741 --> 37:31.008
Sit down.

37:31.043 --> 37:32.309
Sit.

37:32.344 --> 37:33.911
All right.

37:33.946 --> 37:36.013
It's fresh paint.
This is not good.

37:36.048 --> 37:37.081
I was hoping to find

37:37.116 --> 37:38.182
evidence of blood.

37:38.217 --> 37:39.457
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

37:39.485 --> 37:40.718
Will you just use
your blue light?

37:40.753 --> 37:43.053
No, there are compounds in paint

37:43.089 --> 37:45.422
that obliterate any traces
of hemoglobin.

37:45.458 --> 37:47.958
We need to pry the nails

37:47.993 --> 37:49.426
out of this railing,

37:49.462 --> 37:50.861
where the paint didn't reach.

37:50.896 --> 37:53.030
All right, well, you know,
rip 'em up, will you?

37:53.065 --> 37:54.631
This is destruction of property.

37:54.667 --> 37:56.133
That's great. Bill me.

37:59.338 --> 38:00.504
Anything?

38:02.842 --> 38:03.874
Not on this one.

38:03.909 --> 38:05.375
Just sit down.

38:05.411 --> 38:06.944
Just take a seat.

38:17.690 --> 38:20.557
There's blood.

38:21.761 --> 38:23.460
You know how
the system works.

38:23.496 --> 38:25.329
Now is your one chance
to help yourself out.

38:26.232 --> 38:27.965
I loved Drea.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.500
And when I finally

38:29.535 --> 38:32.302
got the nerve to tell her,
she was surprised.

38:32.338 --> 38:33.670
And angry.

38:33.706 --> 38:36.440
Said I'd betrayed her trust.

38:36.475 --> 38:38.575
I mean,

38:38.611 --> 38:39.877
she hooked up with drug dealers,

38:39.912 --> 38:41.678
but she said she would
never want me.

38:41.714 --> 38:43.647
So you struck her
with your wine glass.

38:43.682 --> 38:46.016
She tried to leave
and you stopped her.

38:46.051 --> 38:47.684
To apologize.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.052
Everything happened so fast.

38:49.088 --> 38:51.321
I had to apologize.

38:51.357 --> 38:52.923
She fought to get away,
you two struggled,

38:52.958 --> 38:54.525
and she went over the railing.

38:57.129 --> 38:59.229
You're gonna need a good lawyer.

39:07.439 --> 39:10.674
Hey, honey, you have a visitor.

39:10.709 --> 39:11.909
Cam.

39:11.944 --> 39:14.111
You're not the house call type.

39:14.146 --> 39:16.446
Well, I am when, uh,

39:16.482 --> 39:18.515
when I need to say
something that can't wait.

39:20.019 --> 39:24.955
I sent you home yesterday
because of me, not you.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.089
I felt guilty.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.992
Ah... what do you mean?

39:29.028 --> 39:32.696
I let you work that day
after the bomb went off.

39:32.731 --> 39:35.299
I knew you were hurt,
and I let you work,

39:35.334 --> 39:37.568
and had I sent you home,

39:37.603 --> 39:41.605
you wouldn't be in that chair.

39:41.640 --> 39:45.209
Cam, I wanted to be there.

39:45.244 --> 39:46.810
And when you showed up
yesterday,

39:46.846 --> 39:50.547
I just was... scared.

39:50.583 --> 39:52.883
And I still am, but I realize

39:52.918 --> 39:55.986
that this isn't
my decision to make.

39:57.489 --> 39:59.223
So...

39:59.258 --> 40:03.260
if you want to come back,
we sure could use you.

40:05.164 --> 40:08.131
I, I mean, I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't worried,

40:08.167 --> 40:11.268
but... it's up to you.

40:11.303 --> 40:14.605
Then I'm going to go back
to the lab.

40:27.786 --> 40:28.986
Geez, look at this.

40:29.021 --> 40:32.055
Hey, Christine sure can
make a mess.

40:32.091 --> 40:33.790
Well, at this point,
she's still reconciling

40:33.826 --> 40:35.292
her incipient need

40:35.327 --> 40:37.094
for creative expression

40:37.129 --> 40:39.563
with marginally developed
fine motor skills.

40:39.598 --> 40:40.931
Exactly what I was going to say.

40:40.966 --> 40:43.567
Angela called.
Oh.

40:43.602 --> 40:45.702
Hodgins is going back
to work tomorrow.

40:45.738 --> 40:47.304
That's good news.

40:47.339 --> 40:48.472
I mean, look, he has something
to look forward to.

40:48.507 --> 40:50.507
I am worried about him.

40:50.542 --> 40:51.542
And her.

40:51.577 --> 40:53.043
Look, they're going to be fine.

40:53.078 --> 40:54.444
You know, you just have
to have a little faith.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.114
You know I don't believe
in the intangible.

40:57.149 --> 41:01.351
I believe in the certainty
of science.

41:01.387 --> 41:04.554
But in this case,
the science just makes me sad.

41:04.590 --> 41:07.324
Gonna be okay, all right?
Come here.

41:07.359 --> 41:09.826
Did you ever think you'd have an
amazing, great husband like me

41:09.862 --> 41:13.030
and three beautiful kids who,
like, love you crazy?

41:13.065 --> 41:15.332
That was an unlikely
turn of events.

41:15.367 --> 41:17.267
Anything is possible.

41:17.303 --> 41:19.703
Angela and Hodgins,
they love each other.

41:19.738 --> 41:20.971
They're strong, okay?

41:21.006 --> 41:22.639
They're going to get
through this.

41:24.810 --> 41:25.943
What?

41:25.978 --> 41:27.911
Christine drew a skeleton.

41:29.815 --> 41:31.281
She miscounted the ribs,

41:31.317 --> 41:35.252
and there aren't nearly enough
phalanges, but...

41:35.287 --> 41:37.287
Like mother, like daughter.

41:37.323 --> 41:39.423
I hope she grows up
to have faith like you.

41:39.458 --> 41:41.191
Faith.

41:41.226 --> 41:42.859
I'm taking this to the office.

41:42.895 --> 41:43.927
Well, I should
probably correct it...

41:43.963 --> 41:45.095
No, you're not
changing a thing.

41:45.130 --> 41:47.364
Well, there aren't enough ribs

41:47.399 --> 41:49.399
or phalanges.
No, no, you don't adjust.

41:49.435 --> 41:51.368
You don't adjust kids' art, Bones.
What are you talking about?

41:51.403 --> 41:53.370
<i>Well, it's inaccurate, Booth.</i>
<i>It doesn't matter...</i>

41:53.405 --> 41:55.238
<i>I don't want her growing up to</i>
<i>think that there are only...</i>

41:55.274 --> 41:57.207
Tell me you got good news, Doc.

41:57.242 --> 41:59.876
I have the results
of your most recent MRI.

41:59.912 --> 42:02.713
And they show that my nerves
have re-growth, don't they?

42:02.748 --> 42:05.716
They don't, Jack.

42:05.751 --> 42:09.786
N-No, wait, wait, wait,
that's not possible.

42:09.822 --> 42:11.888
The axons at the end
of your injured nerve cells

42:11.924 --> 42:13.223
are beginning to atrophy.

42:13.258 --> 42:15.092
Wait, wait a minute.
W-W-W-W-W-Wait, no.

42:15.127 --> 42:17.294
My feet were tingling.
I-I mean, I felt it.

42:17.329 --> 42:20.097
Uh, you were experiencing
phantom sensation,

42:20.132 --> 42:21.932
not actual neural connectivity.

42:21.967 --> 42:25.502
But it could still happen,
right?

42:25.537 --> 42:28.705
In my opinion, no.

42:28.741 --> 42:32.275
I am sorry.

42:32.311 --> 42:35.312
Yeah, I-I, uh, got to go.

42:36.281 --> 42:39.116
Hey, was-was
that Dr. Levy?

42:39.151 --> 42:40.417
Yep.

42:40.452 --> 42:42.719
Okay, well, don't keep it
to yourself.

42:42.755 --> 42:43.987
What-what did she say?

42:44.023 --> 42:44.955
She said...

42:44.990 --> 42:47.657
everything is great.

42:47.693 --> 42:49.760
Okay.

42:49.795 --> 42:52.662
Okay, well, great is great,
right?

42:52.698 --> 42:55.632
Yup.

42:55.667 --> 42:57.434
It is.

42:57.469 --> 42:59.336
It's really great.
