WEBVTT

00:06.965 --> 00:09.099
Des, they found blood on the lanai.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.101
- Whose blood?
- Roller's.

00:15.107 --> 00:16.406
You okay?

00:16.441 --> 00:18.153
You sound a little... stressed
or something.

00:18.177 --> 00:19.609
All is well.

00:19.645 --> 00:20.577
Your dream salon

00:20.612 --> 00:22.579
sent in a spy to check out your zhuzh.

00:22.614 --> 00:25.081
Hey, could I settle up? Just a second.

00:25.117 --> 00:27.317
Glint Nails is off the menu.

00:28.687 --> 00:30.020
We found him...

00:30.055 --> 00:31.421
what was left of him.

00:31.456 --> 00:33.256
He was my little brother.

00:33.292 --> 00:35.792
I was supposed to protect him.

00:35.827 --> 00:39.229
Only thing I need coming out
of that mouth of yours

00:39.264 --> 00:41.264
is, "I don't know shit,"
and, "I didn't see shit."

00:41.300 --> 00:44.034
HHelp me.

00:44.069 --> 00:45.235
What happened?

00:45.270 --> 00:47.137
They got me.

00:54.613 --> 00:58.915
The night Roller was killed,
I heard a shot.

00:58.951 --> 01:00.784
I went out to go look,

01:00.819 --> 01:04.554
and... somebody was dragging
Roller's body

01:04.590 --> 01:05.998
out to the dock.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.359
Good lord.

01:09.394 --> 01:10.660
II didn't even know

01:10.696 --> 01:12.529
there was somebody else in the house.

01:12.564 --> 01:16.833
He jumped me
and put a hood over my head.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.768
They took me out to the swamp.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.106
You're probably just confused.

01:23.141 --> 01:25.141
Did you see any of these people?

01:25.177 --> 01:26.710
They kept the hood over my head.

01:27.446 --> 01:29.698
What happened, baby girl?

01:30.716 --> 01:34.985
They put peanut butter all over my feet.

01:37.756 --> 01:40.156
Then I heard pig growls.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.596
You mean oinking?

01:46.632 --> 01:48.665
Yeah. Oinking.

01:49.601 --> 01:53.470
They found some
kind of swamp pig out there.

01:55.707 --> 01:57.374
It started licking my feet...

01:57.409 --> 01:59.909
oinking like crazy,

01:59.945 --> 02:02.245
biting my toes.

02:02.281 --> 02:05.275
Then... Then I heard a rooster,

02:06.151 --> 02:08.518
a ram, and a bull...

02:11.089 --> 02:13.223
- and I...
- Okay.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.091
When you're dehydrated,

02:15.127 --> 02:17.560
you have a tendency to hallucinate.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.002
That's when I realized that...

02:24.636 --> 02:27.237
they had one of those toys with...

02:27.272 --> 02:28.705
with the barnyard sounds.

02:30.342 --> 02:32.575
There was never any pig.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.612
It was them... biting my toes.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.181
I thought you said
you couldn't see anything.

02:38.216 --> 02:40.417
I could see a little bit
through the hood.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.620
You know that material
that's kind of like seethrough?

02:44.200 --> 02:45.955
I think she's talking about burlap.

02:48.093 --> 02:50.794
Yeah. Burlap.

02:50.829 --> 02:52.162
How'd you get out?

02:52.197 --> 02:54.731
There was a screw sticking out
the back of the toilet.

02:54.766 --> 02:57.619
I used it to cut through my ties.

02:58.637 --> 03:02.205
Then I walked on the interstate
for miles and miles

03:02.240 --> 03:04.174
until someone stopped.

03:06.345 --> 03:09.412
Did you hear any names, anything?

03:14.486 --> 03:17.387
"Titus." I think that's who called them.

03:19.091 --> 03:20.857
"Titus"? Yeah, Titus.

03:20.892 --> 03:23.460
Let me take her home.
She's been through it.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.662
How'd you find out about the funeral?

03:25.697 --> 03:27.149
Instagram.

03:28.100 --> 03:29.733
You had your phone?

03:29.768 --> 03:32.902
I called my roommate from a pay phone.

03:32.938 --> 03:36.940
She came and got me,
said she saw a post.

03:38.276 --> 03:41.211
Kenneth, don't you think
she needs to rest?

03:41.246 --> 03:42.946
She needs to rest.

03:42.981 --> 03:44.881
Come on. We need to go talk to Chip.

03:48.084 --> 03:53.217

03:55.293 --> 03:56.426
What happened to the plan?

03:56.461 --> 03:57.827
I came up with a new plan.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.663
Without bothering
to discuss it with me first?

04:00.699 --> 04:02.999
This is my life on the line,
too, you idiot.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.467
Don't call me an idiot.

04:04.503 --> 04:07.637
Just stop talking.

04:07.672 --> 04:10.473
I got enough on my plate, China doll.

04:10.509 --> 04:13.877
Now I got to dodge
your Dr. Dolittle bullshit?

04:13.912 --> 04:16.745
"AAAnd the turkey goes,
'Bkaw, bkaw, '

04:16.781 --> 04:18.748
and the duck goes, 'Quack, quack'"?

04:18.784 --> 04:21.317
Did somebody drop you on
your head when you were a baby?

04:21.353 --> 04:23.052
I created a distraction.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.021
And that is the problem.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.824
You had to run your mouth,
talking some madeup bullshit,

04:27.859 --> 04:30.427
and somebody has got
to now check this out.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.464
My God.

04:34.499 --> 04:36.666
You did this to yourself.

04:36.701 --> 04:39.702
You more than just a little off,
aren't you?

04:41.373 --> 04:42.906
I look like a hero.

04:42.941 --> 04:46.576
No, you look like a dumb-ass
who's gonna get us killed.

04:46.611 --> 04:49.245
When they find out
your story don't add up,

04:49.281 --> 04:51.448
they gonna come for you.

04:51.483 --> 04:53.883
And then they gonna come for me.

04:53.919 --> 04:57.387
And who's gonna take care of
my brother when I'm gone?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.022
No one.

05:00.692 --> 05:03.092
Since your little ass is a flight risk,

05:03.128 --> 05:04.194
you coming home with me.

05:04.229 --> 05:05.728
- Wait, what?
- Shut up.

Christ. Jesus.

05:27.986 --> 05:30.653
They had her tied to a toilet
for two days?

05:30.689 --> 05:32.455
And they drugged this poor, little girl.

05:32.491 --> 05:34.022
How 'bout that?

05:35.206 --> 05:36.638
I'm gonna tell you something...

05:36.775 --> 05:40.497
These the same people who killed my boy.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.465
They are soulless animals.

05:42.501 --> 05:44.701
Was your boy beefing with someone?

05:46.232 --> 05:49.372
Good Lord. You got mayo
on your face there, Chip.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.741
Least I hope that's mayo.

05:51.776 --> 05:54.944
Does the name "Titus"
mean anything to you?

05:54.980 --> 05:56.446
Titus?

05:56.481 --> 05:58.781
Yeah. Titus.

05:58.817 --> 06:02.318
"Tit" with an "us" at the end.
Does it mean anything?

06:02.354 --> 06:05.421
Doesn't ring a bell.
Hey, I'll look into it.

06:05.457 --> 06:06.972
Well, you do that,

06:07.926 --> 06:10.059
and then you bring me
these lowlifes, you hear me,

06:10.095 --> 06:12.063
'cause I'm gonna castrate 'em.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.131
And then I'm gonna hang 'em up
by their intestines.

06:15.859 --> 06:18.101
Then I'm gonna eat
their stillbeating heart,

06:18.136 --> 06:19.669
'cause they gonna pay.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.274
They gonna pay dearly
for what they done.

06:32.484 --> 06:34.183
AAnd they kept you on a toilet?

06:34.219 --> 06:36.886
Out in the swamp.

06:39.624 --> 06:42.659
I used to get locked
in the refrigerator.

06:43.995 --> 06:46.362
You're not like other boys, are you?

06:46.398 --> 06:48.808
MMy IQ is 145.

06:49.434 --> 06:51.301
D... II'm smart.

06:51.336 --> 06:53.102
MMorning, Des.

06:53.138 --> 06:55.238
Good morning.

06:56.002 --> 06:58.308
I'm taking you with me
to the salon today.

06:58.343 --> 07:00.043
Wait, what?

07:00.078 --> 07:01.511
Those girls hate me.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.880
Well, they can just get in line.

07:03.915 --> 07:06.115
I need to talk to you about something.

07:06.151 --> 07:08.251
Virginia, go wash yourself or something.

07:08.286 --> 07:10.038
N... She can stay.

07:10.655 --> 07:13.156
Um, Roller got killed.

07:13.191 --> 07:17.093
Virginia almost got her legs
eaten off by a giant pig.

07:17.128 --> 07:19.495
These are perilous times.

07:19.531 --> 07:20.997
I've decided my time has come for me

07:21.032 --> 07:24.133
to pursue a career
in professional body building,

07:24.169 --> 07:26.469
using the... the lifestyle
and career choices

07:26.504 --> 07:29.806
of Arnold Schwarzenegger
as a kind of a North Star

07:29.841 --> 07:32.675
or guiding principle
to become not only a better man,

07:32.711 --> 07:35.778
but also a stronger American man

07:35.814 --> 07:38.982
who can protect those
who can't protect themselves.

07:39.017 --> 07:41.584
FFor the reasons II've stated here,

07:41.620 --> 07:42.919
II would like to start working

07:42.954 --> 07:45.421
with a professional trainer
as soon as possible.

07:46.116 --> 07:48.758
First, I like your picture.

07:48.793 --> 07:52.061
And second, you don't need
to protect me, Dean.

07:52.097 --> 07:55.064
I'm... I'm fine. BBut somebody has to.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.667
Since Roller died,
yyou've been having nightmares.

07:57.702 --> 07:59.969
And... And... And...
And you're stressed out.

08:00.005 --> 08:02.472
II saw the Funyun
bags everywhere in your room.

08:02.507 --> 08:03.706
It's all over.

08:03.742 --> 08:05.675
You know what, Dean?

08:05.710 --> 08:07.143
You might be right.

08:07.178 --> 08:08.430
Yeah.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.313
Okay.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.683
'Cause it's everywhere...
I can't... It's so messy.

08:14.477 --> 08:16.813
I made you a nutritious breakfast.

08:17.422 --> 08:18.521
Of course you did.

08:19.824 --> 08:21.104
Good morning, my little booboos.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.760
Hi. What time'd you get in?

08:23.795 --> 08:25.361
I didn't even hear you.

08:25.397 --> 08:26.596
3:00.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.515
Brienne, stop picking your nose.

08:29.809 --> 08:30.867
Where were ya?

08:31.703 --> 08:34.837
I was, talking to the police
with Uncle Daddy.

08:34.873 --> 08:37.000
Till 3:00 a.m., though?

08:38.543 --> 08:40.409
Come on, Bryce. Don't get sucked in.

08:40.445 --> 08:43.679
I'm just trying to be there
for him any way I can right now.

08:44.758 --> 08:48.053
He was crying like a little girl
by the end of the night.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.119
Never seen him like this.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.754
I know you just lost your brother,

08:51.790 --> 08:54.891
but, remember,
you don't owe that man shit.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.594
Okay.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.229
Say what you're thinking right now.

09:00.265 --> 09:02.632
Go ahead. Girls.

09:08.573 --> 09:10.440
If I hadn't gone to rehab,

09:10.475 --> 09:13.810
Uncle Daddy would never have
given the clinic to Roller.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.610
Things might have turned out
differently.

09:15.634 --> 09:17.601
And we all would have
lived happily ever after

09:17.636 --> 09:20.037
on a big rock candy mountain
if it weren't for you.

09:20.072 --> 09:21.905
Roller's death was not your fault.

09:21.941 --> 09:23.755
I could have done something, Jenn.

09:24.310 --> 09:28.078
This is not on you.
He was into drugs, guns.

09:28.113 --> 09:29.591
You live by the sword, die by the sword.

09:29.615 --> 09:31.949
Uncle Daddy wants to talk to me.

09:31.984 --> 09:33.617
Okay, but if he brings up the clinic,

09:33.652 --> 09:35.964
you tell him that you're scared
that what happened to Roller

09:35.988 --> 09:37.352
will happen to you.

09:38.424 --> 09:40.522
'Cause you are scared of that, right?

09:49.601 --> 09:50.901
Hey.

09:50.936 --> 09:52.769
Hon, how you doing?

09:52.805 --> 09:54.404
Been okay.

09:59.478 --> 10:03.413
Well, hey, sugar angel.

10:03.449 --> 10:06.683
I couldn't sleep a wink
thinking about you.

10:06.719 --> 10:08.652
Careful of my feet. Of course.

10:08.687 --> 10:12.622
Did you notice what color
your poo was this morning?

10:12.658 --> 10:14.291
You nasty.

10:14.326 --> 10:16.994
You got to check every morning
to make sure it's not black.

10:17.029 --> 10:19.334
That could be a sign
of internal bleeding.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.597
Pol!

10:20.632 --> 10:22.466
What? It is.

10:25.671 --> 10:28.872
Hey, Des, something's wrong
with this shelf back here.

10:28.907 --> 10:30.340
You want to come check it out?

10:30.376 --> 10:31.975
Yes, I will.

10:32.011 --> 10:33.944
I think I'll come back, too.

10:37.143 --> 10:38.882
What?

10:38.917 --> 10:41.351
What is honey darlin' doing here?

10:41.387 --> 10:43.220
She didn't have any place else to go.

10:43.255 --> 10:46.556
She narc'd me out and boned your man.

10:47.593 --> 10:49.326
Somebody tried to kill this girl,

10:49.361 --> 10:51.128
and whoever did it is still out there.

10:51.163 --> 10:52.329
So you brought her here?

10:52.364 --> 10:54.698
Desna, you're getting a little soft.

10:54.733 --> 10:56.299
She doesn't have anybody.

10:56.335 --> 10:58.346
Des, you don't always got to be
everybody's mama bear.

10:58.370 --> 10:59.903
I can be whatever I want to be,

10:59.938 --> 11:03.073
and I'm the boss, so I say she stays.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.341
Got it?

11:06.945 --> 11:09.212
Do you guys do anal bleaching?

11:09.584 --> 11:11.214
- Damn.
- Do we?

11:11.250 --> 11:13.884
Yep, we can help you with that.

11:14.574 --> 11:17.721
Hi, Desna. Yeah, this is Mandy.

11:17.756 --> 11:18.955
Hey, Mandy.

11:18.991 --> 11:21.058
So, I begged and pleaded with Mrs. Kim,

11:21.093 --> 11:22.492
but she was adamant.

11:22.528 --> 11:24.394
She doesn't want your kind
running the salon.

11:24.430 --> 11:25.562
"My kind"? She said...

11:25.597 --> 11:27.097
My... My kind.

11:27.132 --> 11:29.933
WW... See, that is
the problem with Koreans.

11:29.968 --> 11:31.234
They all stereotype.

11:31.270 --> 11:33.203
Yes, I know,

11:33.238 --> 11:35.338
and I'm so sorry
that it didn't work out.

11:35.374 --> 11:37.808
Look, I wish you every success,

11:37.843 --> 11:39.309
but I don't think that...

11:39.344 --> 11:40.277
Mwah!

11:40.312 --> 11:42.179
That you and I are a good fit.

11:42.214 --> 11:45.248
Okay, but, Mandy, there has
to be something we can do.

11:45.284 --> 11:46.650
Sorry.

11:46.685 --> 11:48.024
Hello?

11:48.520 --> 11:50.819
What happened? I'll be damned.

11:51.757 --> 11:53.156
Mandy dropped me as a client.

11:53.192 --> 11:55.292
Well, then, get somebody else.

11:55.327 --> 11:57.627
Mandy was the best.

11:57.663 --> 12:00.030
Buck up, girlfriend.

12:00.065 --> 12:01.998
Things are gonna be just fine.

12:05.504 --> 12:08.705
You and, Roller used
to come out here a lot, right?

12:10.342 --> 12:11.506
Yeah.

12:12.077 --> 12:14.111
Boy was a hell of a shot.

12:17.015 --> 12:18.849
Just a hell of a shot.

12:19.718 --> 12:22.352
Yeah, aalways wwas a little jealous

12:22.387 --> 12:24.686
that this was y'all's thing.

12:25.624 --> 12:29.726
Well... we got to find our thing.

12:29.761 --> 12:31.109
You know, I...

12:31.630 --> 12:35.866
I'm spending all my resources
trying to find who...

12:35.901 --> 12:38.135
who done this thing, you know?

12:38.170 --> 12:40.770
I got some boys coming up
from South Carolina,

12:40.806 --> 12:43.673
got Chip working day and night
on this thing.

12:43.709 --> 12:46.576
I ju...

12:46.612 --> 12:48.167
I need you.

12:48.914 --> 12:50.413
I need you to...

12:50.449 --> 12:51.982
to help out with the clinic.

12:56.355 --> 12:57.980
Bryce, you...

12:58.510 --> 13:00.710
You're a Husser, boy.

13:00.845 --> 13:02.511
You're family.

13:07.499 --> 13:10.534
I don't want what happened
to Roller to happen to me.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.240
Thank you, Uncle Daddy, but I just...

13:17.964 --> 13:19.943
This just isn't my plan for my life.

13:19.978 --> 13:22.112
God damn it, Bryce!

13:26.518 --> 13:28.151
Do me a favor.

13:28.187 --> 13:30.954
Help out at the clinic for a week

13:30.989 --> 13:33.390
while I find these bastards, okay?

13:33.425 --> 13:35.058
Just help me out for a week.

13:35.761 --> 13:38.728
Hell, I'll even... I'll even pay you

13:38.764 --> 13:41.464
what I... what I... what I...
what I paid Roller.

13:42.601 --> 13:45.001
No, Uncle Daddy,
you don't have to pay me, okay?

13:46.138 --> 13:48.505
It's 10k for the week.

13:55.205 --> 13:58.740
The worst part was their breath.

13:59.686 --> 14:01.419
It was so bad. I...

14:02.856 --> 14:04.723
I could smell it through my hood.

14:05.995 --> 14:10.328
I don't think I could ever eat
peanut butter ever again.

14:11.503 --> 14:15.537
I mean, maybe almond butter, but...

14:15.573 --> 14:18.341
Did they make you give 'em blowjays?

14:18.800 --> 14:20.910
- Polly!
- Did they?

14:20.945 --> 14:23.296
No, but I would have for some food.

14:23.297 --> 14:27.132
Speaking of, could somebody
get me a Squirt

14:27.168 --> 14:28.734
with, extra lime?

14:28.769 --> 14:32.605
NNNNot diet, but, um,
with chipped ice, please?

14:32.640 --> 14:34.840
Did they break your legs, too?

14:34.876 --> 14:37.843
I'll go. I was fixin' to go out anyway.

14:37.879 --> 14:40.900
Can you add
a shrimp salad sandwich

14:40.936 --> 14:43.120
on a hamburger bun with slaw?

14:43.156 --> 14:44.659
I'm hungry.

14:45.453 --> 14:47.386
In the mornings

14:47.421 --> 14:49.655
it was so cold.

14:49.690 --> 14:52.077
I mean, I thought my feet were
gonna fall off for real, you guys.

14:52.101 --> 14:54.206
It was 95 degrees all week.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.461
Mnhmnh. Not in the shade.

14:56.462 --> 14:59.496
Well, it can get chilly in the swamp,

14:59.531 --> 15:02.532
and stress can lower
your body temperature.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.069
But also talking about it
can bring on PTSD,

15:06.105 --> 15:09.934
so why don't you hush
so you can heal yourself?

15:09.959 --> 15:11.826
Come on. Relax in my office.

15:18.183 --> 15:20.384
Hey, there.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.820
I'm looking for a young lady
named Virginia Loc.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.756
Well, the young part's accurate.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.658
Can I help you?

15:27.693 --> 15:30.427
I'm Detective Chip Lauderdale,
Palmetto P.D.

15:31.137 --> 15:34.140
I'm investigating
Roller Husser's murder.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.834
I would love to ask you a few questions.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.070
That's fine, Detective.
Come on, right in my office.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.204
Just Virginia.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.206
II, I don't...

15:43.242 --> 15:44.452
She's a little fragile right now,

15:44.476 --> 15:46.109
so I should probably be there.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.778
I'll be gentle.

15:55.461 --> 15:59.096
Saigon, Saigon.

15:59.431 --> 16:06.178
So, when you got out of wherever
those Titus guys had you,

16:06.204 --> 16:07.370
what road were you on?

16:07.766 --> 16:12.602
Well, eventually I got to the 301,

16:12.638 --> 16:16.006
but I wandered around a lot before that.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.628
Where to, exactly?

16:18.944 --> 16:20.410
By Lake Manatee,

16:20.646 --> 16:24.091
then I followed the river
forever and ever.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.918
I kept thinking that I heard cars,

16:27.953 --> 16:30.556
but I could never find the road.

16:31.990 --> 16:35.394
It was like a mirage or something.

16:35.894 --> 16:40.764
You know when, like,
you're so thirsty in the desert

16:40.799 --> 16:44.401
and you see an oasis?

16:44.436 --> 16:47.137
I know what a mirage is, honey.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.973
So, you called your roommate
from a pay phone.

16:50.008 --> 16:51.441
Where was that?

16:51.477 --> 16:54.244
At the corner store on Old Tampa Road.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.979
There's a Beef 'O' Brady's over there.

16:56.014 --> 16:58.181
I love Beef 'O' Brady's.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.183
My God! Me too!

17:00.219 --> 17:02.385
Rare meat makes me gag.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.921
That goes away.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.719
Hey, 'scuse me. I just need to...

17:09.762 --> 17:12.194
Just got to get something
out of this drawer...

17:12.231 --> 17:14.998
Damn it. It's stuck.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.069
Can it wait?

17:20.105 --> 17:21.905
No, I got to get change for $100

17:21.940 --> 17:23.473
and my lockbox is in here.

17:25.310 --> 17:27.144
I got enough for now anyway.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.323
Glad to be of help.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.650
Do you have detail diarrhea?

17:33.685 --> 17:36.586
You just told him 1,000 things
that he can check out

17:36.622 --> 17:38.855
and find out that they're not true.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.590
Beef 'O' Brady's? Come on!

17:40.626 --> 17:42.926
There is a Beef 'O' Brady's over there.

17:42.961 --> 17:43.994
Let's go.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.195
WWhere we going?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.563
Where you think?

17:46.598 --> 17:48.064
We got to get to that corner store

17:48.100 --> 17:50.600
before he does, Saigon.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.106
Tell Mandy that I called.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.141
I sure will, but she's really swamped

17:58.177 --> 17:59.676
getting ready for an event tonight

17:59.711 --> 18:01.378
for a handful of goldstar clients,

18:01.413 --> 18:03.146
female entrepreneurs,
that kind of thing.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.348
So we'll probably
get back to you next week.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.417
Tell Mandy I'll see her there.

18:07.452 --> 18:09.219
What?

18:14.092 --> 18:15.358
Hey, Jeff.

18:15.394 --> 18:17.527
Did, you work here yesterday?

18:17.563 --> 18:19.262
- I work every day.
- Good.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.933
Then you probably remember
seeing this young lady.

18:22.968 --> 18:24.534
She came in, she was bleeding.

18:24.570 --> 18:25.902
I had an orange dreamsicle.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.671
I would remember that.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.806
Especially 'cause we don't sell those.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.609
There you go with the damn details.

18:32.644 --> 18:35.545
Okay, would this jog
your memory, though,

18:35.581 --> 18:38.081
particularly if a cop came in asking?

18:38.116 --> 18:39.449
Sure would not.

18:39.484 --> 18:41.062
How you like me now, Jeff?

18:41.854 --> 18:43.153
Not much better.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.435
What if we add a hummer?

18:44.471 --> 18:46.984
- Who is "we"?
- I got this.

18:48.402 --> 18:50.026
Watch the front counter.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.195
Hurry up.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.200
Cop could get here any minute.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.442
Now am I a hero?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.713
Malala's got nothing on you, boo.

19:16.798 --> 19:19.332
I hope you're not judging me.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.477
I most certainly am not.

19:22.728 --> 19:26.372
But is that how you gonna solve
your problems all your life?

19:27.066 --> 19:28.908
Worked so far.

19:28.943 --> 19:32.645
You should think about
building some other skills.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.813
Seriously.

19:33.848 --> 19:36.015
You don't have to do that anymore.

19:46.994 --> 19:48.672
Make sure you feel that strain
in your booty.

19:48.696 --> 19:50.516
Okay. Ready? Get lower. Lower.

19:50.551 --> 19:51.815
Aah!

19:52.834 --> 19:54.467
Lit goes a lot better if y...

19:54.502 --> 19:56.013
if you tell me
before you're gonna touch me.

19:56.037 --> 19:58.012
- My bad.
- It's... It's from my childhood,

19:58.048 --> 20:00.506
- my problems.
- Mine too.

20:00.541 --> 20:03.242
DDo you know anything
about weightlifting regulations

20:03.277 --> 20:04.744
aand methodologies?

20:04.779 --> 20:07.513
I know how to get prison cut
using a slab of concrete.

20:07.548 --> 20:09.081
OOWait. You went to prison.

20:09.117 --> 20:10.117
Did you kill somebody?

20:12.086 --> 20:14.086
What serendipity.

20:14.122 --> 20:15.254
Who's your friend?

20:15.289 --> 20:16.622
II'm Dean.

20:16.657 --> 20:17.857
Please don't touch me.

20:17.892 --> 20:19.992
I have called you 27 times.

20:20.027 --> 20:21.994
I sent you flowers
for your tongue surgery.

20:22.029 --> 20:23.996
I sent you a vaginal selfie
every morning.

20:24.031 --> 20:25.398
You don't even have the courtesy

20:25.433 --> 20:26.473
to give me a twoword text.

20:26.501 --> 20:28.534
"Stop it" is two words.

20:30.248 --> 20:33.783
So... you said you wanted to talk.

20:33.818 --> 20:34.925
Talk.

20:36.677 --> 20:38.596
I got a favor to ask you.

20:39.891 --> 20:41.257
It's a big one.

20:41.293 --> 20:43.960
Lord.

20:43.995 --> 20:45.862
Like the time you asked me
to take a picture

20:45.897 --> 20:47.830
of your hemorrhoids
when we was in Cancún?

20:49.334 --> 20:51.935
First of all, how you dare you?

20:51.970 --> 20:53.503
No, how dare you?

20:53.538 --> 20:55.605
That itch and burn was so fierce!

20:55.640 --> 20:57.607
'Cause you ain't right!

20:57.642 --> 21:00.276
I tried to get my own phone back
there to take a picture.

21:00.312 --> 21:01.911
Well...

21:02.414 --> 21:03.780
Don't act like you don't like it.

21:03.815 --> 21:05.148
No, I did not.

21:05.183 --> 21:06.983
Look at this!

21:08.253 --> 21:10.420
That's a perfectly... good shrimp.

21:11.045 --> 21:13.056
So, come on. Shoot.

21:13.091 --> 21:14.490
What's up?

21:14.935 --> 21:18.194
I want you to train Bryce
to run the clinic.

21:19.965 --> 21:24.834
In the words of my very dear
friend, "No, ma'am, ma'am."

21:24.869 --> 21:25.835
- Des.
- No.

21:25.870 --> 21:27.003
- Please.
- No.

21:27.038 --> 21:30.139
I'm not training your husband
on how to be Roller.

21:30.175 --> 21:32.642
Well, Uncle Daddy's got him
by the short hairs,

21:32.677 --> 21:34.055
and that clinic's gonna eat him up.

21:34.079 --> 21:35.211
You know it. I know it.

21:35.247 --> 21:36.879
Well, let Uncle Daddy train him.

21:36.915 --> 21:38.659
- It's his damn clinic.
- Uncle Daddy don't know shit

21:38.683 --> 21:39.916
except how to spend money.

21:39.951 --> 21:41.718
I'm trying to get out of this mess,

21:41.753 --> 21:43.219
not further in.

21:45.290 --> 21:46.485
Well, I'ma beg you.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.124
Please don't.

21:48.159 --> 21:49.584
- Please.
- No.

21:49.620 --> 21:51.661
- Ma'am.
- No.

21:51.696 --> 21:52.929
It's only temporary anyway

21:52.964 --> 21:54.797
until they find the guys who got Roller.

21:56.073 --> 21:58.540
No. I'm not gonna do it.

21:58.837 --> 22:00.603
Who snuck you into New Edition concert?

22:00.639 --> 22:02.572
New Edition concert? Are you serious?

22:02.607 --> 22:04.641
Why do you always bring that up?

22:04.676 --> 22:06.053
Because that was
the best night of your life,

22:06.077 --> 22:07.277
and I facilitated that.

22:10.849 --> 22:12.615
- Okay.
- Yeah?

22:12.651 --> 22:14.350
It was the best night of my life.

22:14.386 --> 22:15.918
Yes! Yes!

22:17.055 --> 22:19.055
You're the best!

22:19.090 --> 22:20.568
I would kiss you,
but I know you don't like it!

22:20.592 --> 22:21.958
Please don't. No, I don't.

22:21.993 --> 22:23.760
Get off. Get off.

22:23.795 --> 22:25.473
Des, I feel like I'm gonna
be able to sleep at night

22:25.497 --> 22:27.329
knowing you got your eyes on him.

22:28.224 --> 22:29.732
I got it.

22:34.706 --> 22:37.073
Hey, Clay.

22:37.108 --> 22:38.775
Meet me at She She's.

22:38.810 --> 22:40.384
It's urgent.

22:43.114 --> 22:44.763
Here we go.

23:01.199 --> 23:03.032
Well, looky there...

23:03.068 --> 23:05.242
woman of the year.

23:06.071 --> 23:09.172
I spoke to Jenn, and you don't
have to sell me on it.

23:09.207 --> 23:10.440
I'm in.

23:10.475 --> 23:12.442
That's what I'm talking about.

23:13.417 --> 23:15.578
Thanks, Des.

23:17.449 --> 23:18.839
Uncle Daddy,

23:19.417 --> 23:21.017
I got to make something perfectly clear.

23:21.052 --> 23:23.553
All right, now, this...
this is just temporary, right?

23:23.588 --> 23:25.455
I'm out as soon
as we achieve some closure

23:25.490 --> 23:26.923
on what happened to Roller.

23:26.958 --> 23:27.990
Me too, Clay.

23:28.026 --> 23:30.293
I agreed to help Roller for a time.

23:30.328 --> 23:32.028
Out of respect for his memory,

23:32.063 --> 23:34.597
I'll train your other son
on how to work the clinic,

23:34.632 --> 23:36.699
but I didn't sign up for this life.

23:39.471 --> 23:41.653
If that's what it's got to be, then...

23:42.474 --> 23:45.157
Yeah.

23:46.311 --> 23:48.611
Hey, Chip. What's the word?

23:48.646 --> 23:52.415
Well, we found the store
that Saigon made that call from.

23:52.450 --> 23:54.817
Looks like her story checks out.

23:54.853 --> 23:57.453
And I got somebody looking
into that Titus thing, too.

24:00.959 --> 24:02.258
It worked.

24:02.293 --> 24:04.160
The corner store? I told you.

24:04.195 --> 24:05.328
Easy.

24:05.363 --> 24:06.796
We're quite a team, aren't we?

24:06.831 --> 24:08.722
We'll see about that, Titus.

24:12.959 --> 24:15.393
Dean! Dean!

24:19.198 --> 24:20.765
You don't want to finish training?

24:20.800 --> 24:23.000
YYYou weren't focused.

24:23.036 --> 24:24.435
II wanted a real trainer

24:24.470 --> 24:25.881
who's gonna make me look like Arnold,

24:25.905 --> 24:27.538
but my sister hired you instead,

24:27.573 --> 24:29.874
just like when she didn't
get me the house I wanted.

24:29.909 --> 24:32.246
Now we're still living with mold.

24:33.112 --> 24:35.946
You have no idea how much
your sister does for you.

24:35.982 --> 24:38.015
SShe makes promises.

24:38.051 --> 24:41.652
Well, some promises take longer
than others, Dean.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.721
She's working on it!

24:48.895 --> 24:50.428
You are not gonna believe this...

24:50.463 --> 24:54.165
They have dropped
their asking price $200,000!

24:54.200 --> 24:57.535
Yeah! They are so motivated to sell.

24:57.570 --> 24:58.969
This is happening.

24:59.005 --> 25:00.871
Mnhmnh!

25:03.509 --> 25:05.309
Well, this is a surprise.

25:05.344 --> 25:08.279
Mandy, I'm sorry to interrupt
your little fancy jimmyjam.

25:08.314 --> 25:10.314
I just need one minute of your time.

25:10.349 --> 25:11.649
You know, I thought my assistant

25:11.684 --> 25:13.851
was gonna set something up
in a couple weeks.

25:13.886 --> 25:15.519
I can't wait that long,

25:15.555 --> 25:17.633
and I know I messed things up
with Mrs. Kim, and I'm sorry,

25:17.657 --> 25:20.791
but there has to be
other salons out there.

25:20.827 --> 25:22.104
You know, I have an acquaintance

25:22.128 --> 25:24.161
who specializes in properties

25:24.197 --> 25:26.097
that are a little more your speed,

25:26.132 --> 25:28.032
so why don't I give you her number?

25:28.067 --> 25:30.601
Wow, okay. That's code for ghetto.

25:30.636 --> 25:32.903
I don't want that. I want the best...

25:32.939 --> 25:34.505
My. God.

25:34.540 --> 25:36.841
Look at your fabulous aquarium mani.

25:36.876 --> 25:38.109
- Thank you.
- My goodness!

25:38.144 --> 25:39.388
Sarah, Kiki, Kelly, get over here.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.812
Look at these nails. Look at these.

25:40.847 --> 25:42.613
- Yes!
- Don't you just die?!

25:42.648 --> 25:44.193
These are all my bridesmaids
for my wedding next month.

25:44.217 --> 25:45.416
- Yeah.
- My God.

25:45.451 --> 25:47.351
Nice to meet you, and congratulations.

25:47.386 --> 25:49.019
- Thank you.
- They're so good.

25:49.055 --> 25:50.888
You girls know what?

25:50.923 --> 25:53.190
This would make a perfect look

25:53.226 --> 25:54.725
for a bachelorette party.

25:54.761 --> 25:55.926
Yes!

25:55.962 --> 25:57.294
Bridesmaids, take note!

25:57.330 --> 25:59.630
Um, where did you get these done?

25:59.665 --> 26:01.165
Actually, I did them myself.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.834
I have a salon...
Nail Artisans of Manatee County.

26:03.870 --> 26:05.002
Where's that?

26:05.037 --> 26:06.137
Palmetto Plaza.

26:06.172 --> 26:07.404
Is it safe over there?

26:08.775 --> 26:10.307
Is it safe over there?

26:10.343 --> 26:11.709
Yes, it's safe over there.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.010
Now, I'm not gonna lie.

26:13.045 --> 26:15.379
It is a little lowrent,
but it's temporary

26:15.414 --> 26:18.249
until I get my new salon in Sarasota.

26:18.284 --> 26:21.018
Well, I think we have
a field trip, ladies!

26:22.221 --> 26:24.755
Can you see us tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.?

26:25.275 --> 26:27.391
Because you're friends of Mandy,

26:27.426 --> 26:29.660
I'll see you at 4:00. All: Yay!

26:35.635 --> 26:37.334
Roller always said the biggest challenge

26:37.370 --> 26:39.837
was finding wholesalers
who were willing to ship us

26:39.872 --> 26:41.572
the quantity of pills.

26:41.607 --> 26:44.642
The bulk of your job will be
chasing down his old contacts,

26:44.677 --> 26:46.443
maintaining relationships with the reps.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.078
And why was that so difficult?

26:48.114 --> 26:50.481
Because we move more Oxy
than the clinic should.

26:50.516 --> 26:53.717
The D.E.A. keeps an eye on that,
so Roller had to piecemeal...

26:53.753 --> 26:55.186
and order a little bit

26:55.221 --> 26:56.520
from a whole lot of wholesalers.

26:56.556 --> 26:58.088
WWWhy can't we just keep ordering

26:58.124 --> 26:59.623
from the same companies?

26:59.659 --> 27:01.759
II need to take this.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.027
Hey.

27:03.062 --> 27:04.995
Most of them will only deal with Roller,

27:05.031 --> 27:06.397
so it's a process, okay?

27:06.432 --> 27:08.265
You're gonna be wooing
and washing money.

27:08.301 --> 27:09.967
I can wash. I can woo.

27:10.002 --> 27:11.468
Okay, let's just move this along.

27:11.504 --> 27:12.944
I got some important clients coming.

27:12.972 --> 27:14.839
What?

27:14.874 --> 27:17.107
Kenneth?

27:19.545 --> 27:21.011
Kenneth.

27:21.047 --> 27:23.013
WWhat'd you do?

27:23.049 --> 27:25.460
My exwife Shelly's getting remarried.

27:27.553 --> 27:29.553
And you're gonna have to deal
with this craycray

27:29.589 --> 27:31.822
who loses his shit on the daily.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.090
All right, come on.

27:33.125 --> 27:34.758
Once you get to $30,000,

27:34.794 --> 27:36.438
that's when you're gonna
want to wash the money.

27:36.462 --> 27:38.128
And that's when I would call you?

27:38.164 --> 27:40.831
Right, or any of Uncle Daddy's

27:40.867 --> 27:42.299
other legitimate businesses...

27:42.335 --> 27:43.701
She She's, the vending machines...

27:43.736 --> 27:44.869
But you're close.

27:44.904 --> 27:46.337
But I might not always be here.

27:48.207 --> 27:49.874
As a matter of fact,
I'm not gonna be here

27:49.909 --> 27:50.975
for the rest of the day.

27:51.010 --> 27:52.710
Wait. WhWhere you going?

27:52.745 --> 27:55.412
I'll be right down at the other
end of the parking lot.

27:55.448 --> 27:57.848
Ken will be here. If there's
an emergency, call me.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.620
But don't have an emergency.

28:01.053 --> 28:04.688
Where is she?

28:06.993 --> 28:08.959
Ladies, welcome.

28:08.995 --> 28:11.729
Does anybody want a refreshment or...

28:11.764 --> 28:14.698
Well, I already gave 'em
cucumber water that I made,

28:14.734 --> 28:18.269
and there's wine, right, Quiet Ann?

28:18.304 --> 28:20.604
No, let's just get the nails going.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.641
We have a reservation in a couple hours.

28:23.676 --> 28:26.911
Okay. Well... Okay.

28:26.946 --> 28:29.613
Um, how do you know what to put
on someone's nails?

28:30.525 --> 28:32.850
Well, you know how people say

28:32.885 --> 28:36.520
that the eyes are the window
to the soul?

28:36.555 --> 28:39.356
I don't think so. For me, it's nails.

28:39.392 --> 28:43.394
So, what you want your nails
to say, bride?

28:43.429 --> 28:45.796
"Ice cold panic."

28:45.831 --> 28:47.364
Do you have that color?

28:47.400 --> 28:49.400
I can hook it up.

28:49.435 --> 28:51.468
I remember my first wedding.

28:51.504 --> 28:54.004
I was so nervous.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.906
I mean, I was 14 years old.

28:56.468 --> 29:00.177
My parents were in the
Symbionese Liberation Army.

29:00.212 --> 29:01.545
With Patty Hearst?

29:01.580 --> 29:04.415
Yes, ma'am. We used to bunk together.

29:04.450 --> 29:07.685
Yeah, she was...
she was like a big sister.

29:09.555 --> 29:14.191
But anyhoo, they made me
marry the leader who was 57.

29:14.226 --> 29:16.360
And you did it?

29:16.395 --> 29:18.729
But his other four wives were real nice.

29:18.764 --> 29:22.533
We all ran away together after
he got burned up in a fire.

29:23.736 --> 29:25.069
And then what happened?

29:25.104 --> 29:26.704
Well, it's kind of a long story.

29:26.739 --> 29:29.440
Okay, now who's ready for Chardonnay?

29:29.475 --> 29:30.774
- Yes! Definitely!
- All of us.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.109
- Are you in?
- Kiki.

29:32.144 --> 29:34.311
- Mandy?
- Just a little bit.

29:34.347 --> 29:35.713
- Come on, Mandy!
- Mandy!

29:35.748 --> 29:36.959
All my girls, all my bridesmaids!

29:36.983 --> 29:38.716
Ann, hook everybody up.

29:38.751 --> 29:40.184
Okay, kids!

29:40.219 --> 29:43.687
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

29:47.093 --> 29:48.826
Okay, listen to me, Verla.

29:48.861 --> 29:50.127
Now what we have to do

29:50.162 --> 29:52.162
is always stay true to our intentions.

29:52.198 --> 29:54.231
That is the most powerful thing we have.

29:54.266 --> 29:55.899
Can I see the doctor yet?

29:55.935 --> 29:57.234
Soon enough.

30:01.173 --> 30:03.574
Dr. Ken, look what Bryce is doing.

30:03.609 --> 30:06.810
Don't let him do that.
II need to take this.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.979
You want to be the hammer,
not the nail, okay?

30:09.015 --> 30:10.514
Head down, bull horns.

30:10.549 --> 30:13.650
So, can you... can you hear me
fine, and can you see me?

30:13.686 --> 30:16.787
Yes. Who cares if Shelly
gets married again?

30:16.822 --> 30:19.757
Honestly, do you... Do you think
he's betterlooking than me?

30:19.792 --> 30:22.593
Nobody's betterlooking
than my beautiful boy.

30:22.628 --> 30:25.162
Stop looking at her posts.
I keep telling you...

30:25.197 --> 30:27.398
These are the perils of social media.

30:27.433 --> 30:30.934
It's like some kind
of negative masturbation.

30:30.970 --> 30:32.781
'Cause every day is a new day
to hit the reset button.

30:32.805 --> 30:34.271
Dr. Ken said to stop doing that.

30:34.306 --> 30:36.273
I'm just getting to know
one of our regulars.

30:36.308 --> 30:37.608
TThis is Verla.

30:37.643 --> 30:39.243
She has a bulging disk
in her lower back.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.780
Hey, excus... Sir?

30:42.815 --> 30:45.716
Hey. Sir, are you okay?

30:45.751 --> 30:47.117
Are you okay?

30:48.521 --> 30:50.320
Masturbation leads to procrastination.

30:50.356 --> 30:52.222
Dr. Ken! Dr. Ken! Hey.

30:52.258 --> 30:53.977
There's some guy having a seizure
in there. Come on, come on!

30:54.001 --> 30:55.192
Mom, I got to go. I love you.

30:55.227 --> 30:56.660
Are you meditating?

30:59.231 --> 31:00.564
Are you kidding me?

31:00.599 --> 31:02.533
Geez. Grab his legs.

31:02.568 --> 31:04.234
Get th... Grab his feet.

31:04.270 --> 31:05.669
Deep breath.

31:08.207 --> 31:10.707
There's a delivery. Can you...
In the back.

31:12.845 --> 31:14.878
It's slippery. Goddamn ponytail.

31:14.914 --> 31:18.215
Sign for me right here.

31:19.618 --> 31:21.785
And the code.
Right, right. Sorry, sorry.

31:21.821 --> 31:24.154
Bryce, can you get back here?
I need your help over here.

31:30.896 --> 31:33.130
Grab his feet. It's gonna be all right.

31:36.402 --> 31:39.336
Are you sure you're okay?

31:39.371 --> 31:41.105
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:41.140 --> 31:43.373
You should probably
get yourself to an E.R.

31:43.409 --> 31:45.776
I will. A little later today.

31:47.513 --> 31:48.579
You saved that guy.

31:48.614 --> 31:50.747
You know, all in a day's work.

31:52.351 --> 31:53.550
Wow.

31:53.586 --> 31:55.814
Who left the stockroom door open?

31:56.255 --> 31:58.122
I let the delivery guy in.

31:58.157 --> 31:59.389
What?

32:24.926 --> 32:27.826
I mean, he was the first
black country star I ever met,

32:27.862 --> 32:31.030
and one ride on that mechanical bull,

32:33.633 --> 32:36.401
he swept me off my feet.

32:36.436 --> 32:38.169
It's just a shame he loved armed robbery

32:38.204 --> 32:40.004
as much as he did music.

32:40.040 --> 32:43.141
You know, he was the one
that introduced me to Jamal.

32:43.176 --> 32:45.276
I forgot about Jamal!

32:45.312 --> 32:49.280
Who's Jamal? He sounds delicious.

32:49.316 --> 32:51.683
Delicious and nutritious, okay?

32:52.886 --> 32:56.454
He was the first guy to ever propose.

32:56.489 --> 32:58.156
What happened?

32:58.191 --> 32:59.624
Well, his wife said

32:59.659 --> 33:02.026
our wedding wasn't a good idea, okay?

33:03.296 --> 33:04.596
Don't act like I'm the only one

33:04.631 --> 33:06.164
who ever dated a married man.

33:06.199 --> 33:07.966
- Come on, now.
- Present.

33:08.001 --> 33:09.400
Amen.

33:09.436 --> 33:12.270
My God. I was married for six years.

33:12.305 --> 33:14.739
What? You... You never told us that.

33:14.774 --> 33:15.873
What was she like?

33:15.909 --> 33:17.241
He.

33:17.277 --> 33:18.476
- Ann...
- What?

33:18.511 --> 33:20.612
He was a linguistics professor at Yale.

33:20.647 --> 33:24.148
And then when he started
screwing his T.A.,

33:24.184 --> 33:26.050
who I also happened to be screwing...

33:26.086 --> 33:27.518
There it is.

33:27.554 --> 33:29.687
Things went sideways.

33:30.657 --> 33:32.657
You guys have, like, lived.

33:32.692 --> 33:36.160
Shoot! You guys, we just lost
our reservation at Luques.

33:36.196 --> 33:37.428
- Shoot!
- Shoot.

33:37.464 --> 33:39.263
No one cares about the fancy dinner.

33:39.299 --> 33:41.532
I want to party with you girls, okay?

33:41.568 --> 33:43.501
Where do you guys go to get wild?

33:43.536 --> 33:46.771
I know just the place.

33:46.806 --> 33:50.241
But that tiara might be tipped
by the time we get through.

33:50.276 --> 33:51.309
Okay?

33:53.413 --> 33:54.879
Um, Desna, I've been wanting

33:54.914 --> 33:57.315
to ask you this question all night.

33:57.350 --> 33:58.616
Can I touch your hair?

33:58.652 --> 34:00.118
No.

34:09.362 --> 34:12.521
Whoo! Bachelorettes coming through!

34:12.576 --> 34:13.944
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

34:13.969 --> 34:14.969
Yeah!

34:15.001 --> 34:16.467
I'm talking about ladies!

34:55.014 --> 34:58.215
I have never seen Audrey so fired up.

34:58.251 --> 35:02.119
I mean, she does get wild
in Soul Cycle, but...

35:02.155 --> 35:03.654
She just made $5.

35:06.893 --> 35:09.894
Okay, that right there, though?

35:09.929 --> 35:11.495
That surprises me.

35:11.531 --> 35:13.164
Not me.

35:13.199 --> 35:16.667
Quiet Ann looks exactly
like her husband.

35:18.571 --> 35:20.704
Okay.

35:20.740 --> 35:22.406
Thank you for this.

35:22.442 --> 35:23.774
You're welcome.

35:23.810 --> 35:26.310
And, you know, Luques would have boring,

35:26.345 --> 35:28.646
and then half those women
would have thrown it up

35:28.681 --> 35:30.181
in the bathroom anyway.

35:31.684 --> 35:35.920
And these...
Desna, these are incredible.

35:35.955 --> 35:39.323
They are exactly
what I'm thinking and feeling.

35:39.358 --> 35:41.892
This is why I want to open my new place.

35:41.928 --> 35:44.895
I want more women to experience that.

35:44.931 --> 35:47.064
Then I want to franchise!

35:47.100 --> 35:48.499
What?!

35:48.534 --> 35:49.600
Girl!

35:49.635 --> 35:51.402
Yes!

35:53.139 --> 35:55.139
Okay, I will talk to Mrs. Kim

35:55.174 --> 35:57.942
and see if I can make anything happen.

35:57.977 --> 36:00.311
- Thank you.
- Okay.

36:00.346 --> 36:02.746
Now I'm gonna go try a little dancing.

36:02.782 --> 36:04.448
Go get it!

36:04.484 --> 36:07.852
Go, Mandy! Go, Mandy!

36:10.823 --> 36:13.491
These bourgie types can throw down.

36:15.294 --> 36:19.730
The last time I danced with
Roller was up on that stage.

36:22.168 --> 36:23.767
I know, baby.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.040
Hello?

36:30.076 --> 36:32.309
Get your ass to the clinic.

36:32.345 --> 36:34.879
Bring Goldilocks, too.

36:34.914 --> 36:37.314
Shit. We got to go. Now.

36:43.531 --> 36:47.855
I struggle to grasp...

36:48.794 --> 36:50.172
how something like this could happen.

36:50.196 --> 36:52.229
This guy was having a seizure.

36:52.265 --> 36:54.798
The delivery guy seemed so legit.

36:54.834 --> 36:55.834
Desna, where were you?

36:58.804 --> 37:01.572
I had a full house at the salon, Clay.

37:01.607 --> 37:03.538
Full house?

37:05.578 --> 37:08.012
Why don't you tell them
what you found there, Juanda?

37:08.047 --> 37:11.515
We're looking at an $88,000 loss.

37:11.551 --> 37:14.318
- Man.
- But this is particularly staggering af...

37:14.924 --> 37:16.687
after what happened.

37:16.722 --> 37:19.223
Baby. Go ahead and say it, baby.

37:19.258 --> 37:21.425
What happened to our baby boy...

37:22.595 --> 37:24.392
What happened to our Roller.

37:25.298 --> 37:26.497
Got murdered.

37:30.403 --> 37:35.039
Meanwhile... that little tiny
dancer of his

37:35.862 --> 37:38.781
looks like she got shit out a python.

37:42.682 --> 37:46.998
Y'all know hhhow expensive
this all gonna be?

37:48.888 --> 37:51.021
This here... This here clinic...

37:51.057 --> 37:54.058
It was supposed to be the best thing

37:54.093 --> 37:56.460
that ever happened to this family.

38:03.236 --> 38:04.768
Y'all gonna have to work this off.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.971
W... That's not fair!
Well, life's not fair.

38:07.006 --> 38:08.739
Mr. Husser, I wasn't even there.

38:08.774 --> 38:10.741
You were on duty, Kenneth.

38:10.776 --> 38:12.020
And Desna here... You're supposed to be

38:12.044 --> 38:13.444
giving my boy the lay of the land.

38:13.479 --> 38:15.946
And Bryce... Bryce.

38:15.982 --> 38:17.948
My boy Bryce...

38:17.984 --> 38:19.283
You're supposed to be

38:19.318 --> 38:22.200
running this goddamn clinic!

38:23.475 --> 38:25.330
This is disgraceful!

38:25.992 --> 38:27.992
God damn it!

38:29.061 --> 38:32.896
Disgraceful, all y'all.

38:36.102 --> 38:37.768
I will have what I am owed.

38:55.649 --> 38:57.382
Hey, what are you looking for?

39:00.020 --> 39:02.721
Look, I'm stuck, all right?

39:02.756 --> 39:04.089
$80,000 is stuck.

39:04.124 --> 39:05.824
Only as stuck as you want to be,

39:05.859 --> 39:08.412
Mr. Power of Intentional Choice.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.174
I never should have asked Desna
to train you.

39:11.198 --> 39:13.799
I messed up again with Uncle Daddy

39:13.834 --> 39:16.334
when he was trying to help me again.

39:16.370 --> 39:18.236
He knew this was temporary,
he didn't like it,

39:18.272 --> 39:20.150
- now you're indentured for life.
- Come on, honey.

39:20.174 --> 39:22.107
TThat's a little reachyreachy,
isn't it?

39:22.142 --> 39:23.942
I wouldn't put it past him.

39:23.977 --> 39:25.877
What are you looking for?

39:28.315 --> 39:29.600
What is that?

39:30.884 --> 39:32.384
Honey!

39:32.419 --> 39:33.852
Sweetie?

39:33.887 --> 39:36.521
Babe. No, no, no.

39:36.557 --> 39:37.789
Don't you do it. H...

39:37.825 --> 39:40.444
Babe, it's been two years.

39:40.994 --> 39:43.962
Well, this is what this nonsense
is doing to me.

40:25.072 --> 40:28.140
Back to the corner, allemande left.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.047
For the ladies, starting on the left.

40:38.051 --> 40:41.086
When you meet your partner,
turn to my right.

40:42.723 --> 40:43.989
Back to the corner...

40:48.896 --> 40:50.228
Hey, party animal.

40:50.264 --> 40:52.030
Thank you for an incredible night.

40:53.767 --> 40:55.834
Honey, we lived.

40:55.869 --> 40:59.104
Girl, I haven't lived
like that since the '90s.

40:59.139 --> 41:01.773
So, what's up?

41:01.808 --> 41:05.143
Desna, I'm in. You got me.

41:05.179 --> 41:07.879
I'm gonna find you
the best salon in town.

41:07.915 --> 41:10.282
Yeah, screw Glint Nails.

41:11.535 --> 41:14.452
I believe in you and your vision.

41:14.488 --> 41:16.087
All right, thanks, Mandy.

41:16.123 --> 41:17.956
You got it. I'll talk to you later.

41:22.029 --> 41:24.930
What? What?

41:24.965 --> 41:26.298
I got Mandy back!

41:26.333 --> 41:29.568
Yes, girl! I knew you would!

41:29.603 --> 41:30.635
Where's Jenn?

41:30.660 --> 41:32.404
I don't know. Her
car's outside, though.

41:32.439 --> 41:34.272
Well, she better get her butt in here...

41:34.308 --> 41:36.041
'Cause we doing big things.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.042
That's right!

41:37.077 --> 41:39.144
New salon, new life.

41:39.179 --> 41:42.180
Dosido your partner.

41:42.216 --> 41:45.116
Back to your corner, allemande left.

41:45.152 --> 41:47.252
And right, left grand.

41:49.656 --> 41:52.824
When you reach your partner,
swing her and promenade.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.840
Hey! Come join the fun, neighbor.

42:08.875 --> 42:11.743
Yeah, not really a black thing.

42:15.716 --> 42:17.682
I'm sorry, Des.

42:17.718 --> 42:19.584
I'm just trying to distract myself

42:19.620 --> 42:21.119
from becoming a widow.

42:21.154 --> 42:22.554
Mnhmnh. Don't say that.

42:22.589 --> 42:24.756
Bryce has a good head on his shoulders.

42:24.791 --> 42:28.526
Baby, Bryce is a drug addict
just recovered.

42:28.562 --> 42:30.762
He doesn't have so much
as a criminal pinky bone

42:30.797 --> 42:32.097
in his whole body.

42:32.132 --> 42:33.465
If the Dixie Mafia don't get him,

42:33.500 --> 42:34.966
then all those pills will,

42:35.002 --> 42:38.069
and it's gonna take us so long
to pay back Uncle Daddy.

42:38.105 --> 42:40.305
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't there

42:40.340 --> 42:41.740
to keep an eye on him.

42:41.775 --> 42:44.075
It's not your fault, babe.
You can't be everywhere.

42:44.111 --> 42:47.012
I know you want out from under
this mess just as much as I do.

42:47.047 --> 42:51.683
God, I want that. I want it so bad.

42:51.718 --> 42:54.853
I want to get the salon.
I want to live the dream.

42:54.888 --> 42:56.888
I...

42:56.923 --> 42:58.657
I want it for all of us.

42:58.692 --> 43:02.160
Do you think we're gonna be
stuck in Husserville forever?

43:02.771 --> 43:04.296
I know we won't.

43:04.331 --> 43:07.866
That family is like quicksand.

43:07.901 --> 43:11.202
The more you struggle,
the more they just suck you in.

43:11.238 --> 43:13.738
Come here. Don't cry.

43:38.265 --> 43:39.864
They're here.

43:49.176 --> 43:50.809
Set it down.

44:00.135 --> 44:02.620
Worked like a charm, didn't it?

44:02.656 --> 44:04.356
Yes, sir.

44:05.158 --> 44:07.625
I knew it would.

44:08.212 --> 44:09.494
That's for you.

44:12.299 --> 44:13.264
Thank you, sir.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.700
Get you going.

45:20.467 --> 45:22.801
What took you so long?

45:27.274 --> 45:29.607
I missed you, baby girl.

45:36.783 --> 45:40.051
I missed you, too, baby.
I missed you so much.
