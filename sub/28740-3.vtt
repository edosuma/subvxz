WEBVTT

01:24.460 --> 01:26.129
What the hell?

01:35.678 --> 01:38.638
Hey, Tonya, Donny,
you guys got power over there?

01:39.973 --> 01:41.766
Nope. Power's out here, too.

02:32.432 --> 02:35.059
Sweet, sweet Jolene.

02:36.060 --> 02:39.812
Time, I see, has not been kind.

02:43.648 --> 02:45.108
How tragic.

02:46.193 --> 02:48.569
You had such potential.

02:49.779 --> 02:52.947
But I'm not here
to pick apart the past.

02:55.325 --> 02:58.285
I'm far more interested
in the present.

02:59.036 --> 03:02.247
Has someone been
on their feet, my dear?

03:03.373 --> 03:07.251
Have you been building your inscape
without me, Jo?

03:09.628 --> 03:12.255
Have you found a Shorter Way?

03:14.632 --> 03:16.008
No?

03:19.094 --> 03:21.930
But that's the thing about whores.

03:22.639 --> 03:24.306
They lie.

03:25.849 --> 03:26.975
Luckily...

03:28.476 --> 03:31.062
...we have a way to learn the truth.

03:48.410 --> 03:51.620
Must feel like heaven
to have the old things on again.

03:53.372 --> 03:56.374
I recall how fast
you could move in them.

03:57.166 --> 04:00.252
You could out-dance the wind.

04:04.713 --> 04:06.882
I wonder if you've still got it.

04:26.982 --> 04:31.819
I felt the presence of a powerful
strong creative in the area.

04:33.903 --> 04:36.990
So I thought
I'd better find out if their...

04:37.782 --> 04:41.660
interests are a threat to mine...

04:42.286 --> 04:43.745
as yours have been.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.836
I can't say whether I'm relieved

04:53.587 --> 04:55.087
or disappointed...

04:55.796 --> 04:57.256
that I know it isn't you.

04:59.257 --> 05:04.219
Let's not wait another 50 years
before we see each other, Jo.

06:29.789 --> 06:34.084
Oh, there she is. The Brat
has emerged from her cave.

06:35.584 --> 06:38.587
I thought I heard you coming in
late last night. You good?

06:39.088 --> 06:42.298
Chrissy, tell her the joke.
Start from the beginning.

06:42.423 --> 06:43.967
- Alright.
- I peed myself, Vic.

06:44.092 --> 06:46.260
- I swear you're gonna love it.
- Check it out.

06:46.385 --> 06:48.053
- Alright.
- OK.

06:48.178 --> 06:49.888
All the horses drowned!

06:53.182 --> 06:55.017
Are you kidding me?

06:55.142 --> 06:58.562
So... I'm applying to RISD.

06:59.187 --> 07:00.604
I knew you would.

07:00.729 --> 07:01.939
I'm making headway,

07:02.064 --> 07:04.775
but I could use your help
with the financial aid stuff.

07:04.900 --> 07:08.361
- Yeah. You got it.
- I need a copy of your tax return.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.238
I'm not the one going.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.490
I'm your dependent. It's required.

07:13.615 --> 07:15.950
I thought she was 18.
Aren't you, Vic?

07:16.075 --> 07:18.369
They consider you a dependent
until you're 24.

07:19.078 --> 07:22.122
- Doesn't seem fair.
- OK, here's the thing.

07:22.247 --> 07:25.125
I haven't paid any taxes
since, like, '05, you know?

07:25.250 --> 07:26.667
All my work's under the table.

07:27.251 --> 07:30.753
A check stub would work.
A direct deposit statement. Anything.

07:30.878 --> 07:33.881
If any earnings go on paper
and the government sniffs me out,

07:34.007 --> 07:35.008
we're all screwed.

07:37.259 --> 07:39.469
- I thought you wanted me to go.
- Of course.

07:39.595 --> 07:42.138
But people go to jail
for tax evasion, Brat.

07:44.307 --> 07:46.766
You know what you should do?
Ask your mom.

07:46.891 --> 07:49.019
She's a lot better about this stuff.

07:49.853 --> 07:51.395
- Ask her.
- Yeah. OK.

07:52.313 --> 07:53.355
Alright.

08:14.372 --> 08:15.915
Wow, Ma.

08:20.044 --> 08:23.463
The yard looks really...
It looks really nice.

08:23.588 --> 08:25.381
Cost me everything I made this week,

08:25.506 --> 08:28.216
from the Gorsey house
and Mrs Supkins,

08:28.342 --> 08:30.427
but it was money well spent
if you ask me.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.804
Even the mailman said so. Sean.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.265
That man's got a nice face
for a redhead.

08:37.515 --> 08:38.933
That's great.

08:39.558 --> 08:40.559
Ma, I...

08:40.684 --> 08:45.105
Last night I behaved
like a stupid ass. I'm sorry.

08:45.230 --> 08:47.357
It's fine. It's alright.

08:47.899 --> 08:49.067
OK.

08:51.152 --> 08:53.445
Well, I didn't expect
to see you this morning.

08:53.570 --> 08:55.113
There are fresh sheets on your bed.

08:56.614 --> 09:00.284
I need a copy of your tax return.
For college.

09:00.910 --> 09:02.327
Financial aid.

09:06.665 --> 09:09.541
Of course.
Your father can't give you his.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.713
I clean houses for a living, Vicky.

09:15.838 --> 09:18.423
It's all under the table,
same as your dad.

09:21.301 --> 09:24.637
It's a drag, but you've got
to start learning about this stuff.

09:24.762 --> 09:27.097
- What stuff?
- What stuff?

09:27.222 --> 09:30.433
We're not the kind of people
who go to college. OK?

09:30.558 --> 09:33.310
This is why. Start thinking
about getting a real job.

09:33.435 --> 09:34.978
Like scrubbing toilets?

09:37.188 --> 09:39.524
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

09:39.649 --> 09:40.817
I know.

09:42.859 --> 09:45.153
You know, there are other options.

09:46.279 --> 09:47.988
You could go to trade school.

09:48.823 --> 09:52.158
Julianne's daughter,
she's going to hairdressing school.

09:53.118 --> 09:54.869
Beauty school's not for me, Ma.

09:54.994 --> 09:56.871
OK. Well...

09:57.955 --> 10:01.125
I still need help cleaning the Gates'
and the Brewsters' on Friday

10:01.250 --> 10:03.126
if you want to make a little cash.

10:03.251 --> 10:06.087
You can do the floors.
I'll scrub the toilets.

10:08.213 --> 10:10.549
- Thanks, Mom. I'll let you know.
- Yep.

10:34.860 --> 10:36.528
Howdy, Sheriff.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.363
Any word from our lady in Nebraska?

10:40.281 --> 10:42.116
You missed taco night.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.409
I know. I'm sorry.

10:45.034 --> 10:47.662
- That's alright.
- Did our junkyard lady call?

10:47.786 --> 10:51.957
No, Maggie, and she's not going to
because her story's crazy.

10:52.082 --> 10:54.000
She's just some lonely old lady.

10:54.125 --> 10:59.546
Look, I need you
to let this go... OK?

11:00.797 --> 11:05.342
You're... the closest thing
I've got to a daughter

11:05.468 --> 11:07.052
and...

11:07.636 --> 11:09.888
I don't need to find you...

11:10.013 --> 11:13.390
half-frozen on a park bench
ever again.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.352
Closest thing to a daughter, huh?

11:18.770 --> 11:20.646
Beggars can't be choosers, right?

11:22.940 --> 11:24.441
Look, I'm serious.

11:25.692 --> 11:30.613
You need stability,
and you've worked so hard to get it.

11:31.280 --> 11:35.241
So just step away
from the Scrabble bag, alright?

11:35.700 --> 11:37.744
I'm fine, Joe.

11:38.619 --> 11:39.953
I promise.

11:40.621 --> 11:44.457
OK? Go catch some bad guys
or something.

11:45.416 --> 11:48.211
Alright. Talk to you later.

11:49.294 --> 11:50.420
Goodbye.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.558
Hi.

12:06.683 --> 12:09.560
I need a book of Romantic poetry.

12:13.439 --> 12:16.858
"The rain... fell like daggers...

12:18.734 --> 12:21.111
...beating against
the nape of her neck.

12:21.695 --> 12:25.949
She covered her head. She ran.

12:26.449 --> 12:27.992
But the rain was relentless..."

12:28.117 --> 12:30.619
- Shit.
- Sorry. Did I hurt you?

12:30.744 --> 12:33.330
No. I think I have to rain-check.

12:33.955 --> 12:35.039
You're not serious.

12:35.164 --> 12:36.582
I'm so sorry.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.709
Are you going
to help me find that book?

12:39.835 --> 12:41.169
Yeah. Later.

14:05.904 --> 14:07.280
I...

14:08.531 --> 14:10.073
Mr Manx?

14:11.241 --> 14:12.868
It's me.

14:13.994 --> 14:16.454
Have you done as I asked?

14:16.579 --> 14:20.165
Yep. The Shorter Way,
it was an old bridge.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.459
But it's gone now.

14:23.084 --> 14:24.586
It's there.

14:25.252 --> 14:27.922
And its proprietor can't be far.

14:28.964 --> 14:31.174
Excellent work, Bing.

14:32.091 --> 14:33.509
Get in.

15:00.073 --> 15:03.158
People stopped using it
when they put the paved road in.

15:03.951 --> 15:06.994
And then the town tore it down.

15:07.787 --> 15:10.997
A demolished bridge
from a bygone time.

15:12.165 --> 15:15.377
Our strong creative has an old soul,

15:15.501 --> 15:19.129
and a sentimental attachment
to broken things.

15:23.758 --> 15:25.842
Something out there, Mr Manx?

15:27.177 --> 15:30.638
We are the sum of our parts,
Mr Partridge.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.725
Any small piece is helpful
in identifying the whole,

15:35.850 --> 15:39.312
but you've spent more time here
than I have, so...

15:42.064 --> 15:44.108
This bridge also tells us

15:44.233 --> 15:48.486
we're looking for someone who likes
to traverse geographical locations.

15:49.696 --> 15:53.323
Who perhaps longs
to escape their circumstances.

15:54.908 --> 15:57.660
Do you know anyone like that, Bing?

15:58.285 --> 15:59.745
Mr Manx...

16:00.746 --> 16:03.498
...how can a person use
a bridge that isn't even there?

16:03.623 --> 16:05.625
There are many things in this world

16:05.750 --> 16:08.836
that don't require sight,
but rather intuition.

16:11.713 --> 16:13.423
Mittens!

16:14.924 --> 16:16.383
Mittens!

16:18.051 --> 16:19.511
Mittens, where are you, boy?

16:20.387 --> 16:22.346
Come here. I've got some treats.

16:26.224 --> 16:29.060
You two weirdos seen
a black and white cat around here?

16:29.477 --> 16:31.854
No, but we'll keep a lookout.

16:32.479 --> 16:34.231
OK, thanks.

16:35.107 --> 16:38.109
You know, it's funny.
My friend and I are also lost.

16:39.027 --> 16:40.194
Like your cat.

16:42.279 --> 16:45.991
Salem's south on 95 if you're
looking for the Witch Museum.

16:46.116 --> 16:48.200
Actually, dear...

16:49.618 --> 16:53.413
...we're looking for a bridge
called the Shorter Way.

16:53.538 --> 16:55.457
Do you know who rides it?

16:56.041 --> 16:56.915
Nope.

16:57.916 --> 17:02.378
You wouldn't tell me a fib, now,
would you, Haley Smith?

17:02.503 --> 17:04.088
How do you know my name?

17:04.589 --> 17:06.923
I know a great many things.

17:07.339 --> 17:10.886
For instance, I know
Mittens is a lucky kitty indeed

17:11.011 --> 17:15.263
to have a responsible caretaker...
like you.

17:15.388 --> 17:18.348
- He's my friend.
- Of course he is.

17:18.892 --> 17:20.894
You look after each other.

17:22.102 --> 17:25.646
But while you're out here
looking after Mittens...

17:26.939 --> 17:29.025
...who's looking after you?

17:31.694 --> 17:34.196
Would you like a candy cane?

17:35.280 --> 17:38.991
Nice try, but my mom taught me
not to take candy from strangers.

17:39.116 --> 17:40.659
Especially the ugly ones.

17:42.202 --> 17:43.244
Unhand her!

17:45.371 --> 17:48.499
We must never mishandle children,
Mr Partridge.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.835
Hell isn't hot enough
for those who do.

17:52.335 --> 17:55.129
Let this be my first
and final warning.

17:56.339 --> 17:58.423
I'm sorry. Yeah.

18:36.496 --> 18:37.455
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:37.579 --> 18:39.039
What's up with your eye?

18:39.998 --> 18:42.209
Oh, just allergies. Is your mom home?

18:42.334 --> 18:45.962
She's probably getting a wax.
She grows hair like a water buffalo.

18:46.087 --> 18:47.213
You need her?

18:48.839 --> 18:50.674
I need her help with RISD.

18:51.133 --> 18:53.217
Oh. You don't need Angela.

18:53.342 --> 18:56.220
For where there is a Willa,
there is always a way.

18:57.721 --> 19:01.057
They're like, fugitives
from the IRS or some shit,

19:01.182 --> 19:03.600
so I can't even apply
for financial aid.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.519
They sound out of their minds.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.020
Yeah, a recurring theme with them.

19:16.611 --> 19:18.821
My dad moved in with his girlfriend.

19:19.238 --> 19:21.782
- You're shitting me.
- I'm living with them.

19:22.324 --> 19:23.658
Jesus.

19:24.617 --> 19:26.452
She does jewelry.

19:27.036 --> 19:30.455
Like, earrings made from bottle caps.
She calls them "beer-rings."

19:30.581 --> 19:32.666
- That's kind of genius.
- No!

19:32.791 --> 19:34.750
But no offense,
your dad's being a dick.

19:35.585 --> 19:38.795
No, he wants to help me.
He just can't.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.631
Forge that shit and sign his name.
It's not complicated.

19:41.756 --> 19:43.841
I've been signing
Angela's John Hancock

19:43.966 --> 19:45.384
since the Sixth Grade.

19:45.509 --> 19:48.428
These are government loans,
a federal document. I can't...

19:48.553 --> 19:51.139
- You really can.
- No, I can't do that to my dad.

19:56.476 --> 19:59.562
Your mom says she knows someone
from RISD's registrar's office.

20:00.646 --> 20:02.523
Yes. Say no more.

20:02.648 --> 20:05.775
I'll talk to Angela, organize a trip
to Providence. I'm coming.

20:36.217 --> 20:40.011
Did you lock up? I left my portfolio
in Mrs Simonson's classroom.

20:43.473 --> 20:46.642
Bing, my entire future rests
on you letting me inside.

20:47.476 --> 20:50.394
But you know,
no pressure either way.

20:51.395 --> 20:53.773
Anyone else,
I'd have left you in the dust.

20:53.898 --> 20:57.484
Oh. Good thing you owe me
for that Doctor Incubus comic.

20:57.609 --> 20:59.568
Yeah. Maybe.

21:01.904 --> 21:03.322
You OK, Bing?

21:04.031 --> 21:06.616
Yeah. I'm kind of nervous.

21:07.533 --> 21:11.286
I started a new job.
I already messed up.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.706
My boss just gave me another chance
tomorrow to do better, but...

21:16.958 --> 21:18.251
...I don't know if I can.

21:19.251 --> 21:21.628
Sure you can.
You just be yourself.

21:22.254 --> 21:24.089
But, what if...

21:24.588 --> 21:25.965
What if I can't?

21:27.716 --> 21:29.926
You sound like my mother!

21:31.219 --> 21:33.263
That's what she says
about me and college.

21:33.388 --> 21:34.638
- You know what I say?
- No.

21:34.763 --> 21:37.182
I say, screw it, this is America.

21:37.307 --> 21:40.142
Work hard and you can do
anything you damn well please.

21:41.686 --> 21:44.355
Remember what Doctor Incubus said
to the Blue Heron?

21:45.855 --> 21:48.608
"If you don't believe
in your greatness,

21:48.733 --> 21:50.192
no one else will."

21:50.317 --> 21:51.568
Exactly.

21:57.198 --> 21:58.950
Thank you, college girl!

22:02.536 --> 22:04.121
I'll just be a minute, Bing.

22:04.246 --> 22:05.329
Yeah.

22:23.803 --> 22:24.637
Maggie?

22:24.762 --> 22:27.597
- Brat, I need to talk to you.
- Wait, how did you find me?

22:27.723 --> 22:30.057
I'm a librarian and a medium.
I can find anybody.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.726
How did you get here?

22:31.851 --> 22:35.061
I flew on a plane. I came here
to tell you that you're not safe.

22:35.186 --> 22:37.981
My tiles are never wrong.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.858
OK, you think I can help you
find that missing kid?

22:40.983 --> 22:42.401
I'm sorry, but I can't.

22:42.526 --> 22:43.986
No. I mean, yes. Yes, Vic.

22:44.111 --> 22:47.071
I want you to help me find Danny
but I didn't fly out here for him.

22:47.196 --> 22:50.949
The Wraith is here
and he's hunting you.

22:52.034 --> 22:54.161
That doesn't make any sense, Maggie.

22:56.329 --> 23:00.166
Sometimes strong creatives
can sense things. Each other.

23:00.290 --> 23:02.083
I think he senses you
or your bridge.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.336
- Well, I don't sense him.
- Don't you?

23:04.461 --> 23:07.046
You said you saw my library.
What else have you seen?

23:08.672 --> 23:10.340
This stuff is dangerous, Maggie.

23:10.465 --> 23:13.509
One day I find you in your library,
the next day your dog is dead.

23:13.634 --> 23:16.219
Well, that's fine.
Because I don't have a dog.

23:16.928 --> 23:19.431
We shouldn't be messing with it.
I'm...

23:20.098 --> 23:22.933
I'm not going over my bridge again
for anything or anyone.

23:23.059 --> 23:26.311
Vic, my tiles called me.
They never do that.

23:26.436 --> 23:28.438
I can't help you.
I'm going to college.

23:28.563 --> 23:33.275
You want to be normal. OK, I get it.
But we... we are not normal.

23:35.235 --> 23:37.320
I have a chance to get out of here,
Maggie.

23:37.904 --> 23:38.988
I can't pass that up.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.740
You're the only person
that can help me stop this guy.

23:42.449 --> 23:44.368
The only person.

23:45.410 --> 23:47.161
Then I'm sorry you came all this way.

24:30.571 --> 24:33.865
My God. Looks like you banged it up
pretty good, there.

24:33.990 --> 24:36.992
- Yeah.
- What the hell were you doing?

24:37.701 --> 24:40.663
Stupid shit, I guess, so...

24:42.539 --> 24:45.792
I'll give you a ride to the job site
and mend this later.

24:45.917 --> 24:49.169
- Alright.
- There she is. Ready for your trip?

24:51.296 --> 24:53.881
- Providence, huh?
- RISD.

24:55.383 --> 24:58.343
My kid, at college.
Who'd have thunk it?

25:00.011 --> 25:01.304
Alright.

25:05.057 --> 25:06.475
Have fun, OK?

25:06.599 --> 25:09.018
- I will. Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

25:09.561 --> 25:10.437
Bye.

25:10.562 --> 25:13.981
Hey, are you sure
you want to leave town?

25:14.982 --> 25:17.233
Your eye was bleeding a few days ago.

25:17.358 --> 25:20.027
Yeah, from that damn bridge, but...

25:20.611 --> 25:23.947
I'm never going out there again,
so just forget it happened.

25:29.201 --> 25:31.495
Hey, Vic. Craig.

25:31.995 --> 25:33.163
Nice wrench.

25:35.623 --> 25:38.667
- She's funny.
- She ditched you in Eighth Grade.

25:38.792 --> 25:40.836
No, she went to a different school.

25:40.961 --> 25:43.045
What about Tea and Crumpets
over there?

25:45.256 --> 25:47.007
What? You gonna miss me?

25:49.301 --> 25:50.844
Yeah, like a rash.

25:50.969 --> 25:53.262
Come on, bitch. Academia awaits.

25:54.513 --> 25:56.515
Have fun blowing stuff up
with my dad.

26:00.518 --> 26:04.480
- Forgot to mention something?
- They decided to tag along.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.690
Me and Simon will tour Brown
and you and Drew can check out RISD.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.277
I thought your parents disapproved
of art school.

26:12.402 --> 26:15.030
Yeah, what can I say?
You inspired me.

26:15.655 --> 26:17.364
Ride shotgun, McQueen.

26:20.493 --> 26:21.410
It's my car.

26:24.078 --> 26:26.664
Hey. Thanks, Simon.

26:39.382 --> 26:41.843
Any leads on what caused
the power outage?

26:42.385 --> 26:44.094
They're working on it.

26:44.595 --> 26:47.431
It's strange the generators
didn't come on, isn't it?

26:47.555 --> 26:49.974
Folks online are saying
this place is haunted.

26:50.558 --> 26:52.018
Donny was on last night.

26:52.143 --> 26:55.395
Swore he felt the presence
of a ghost or something.

26:55.521 --> 26:58.105
Maybe he just watches
way too much TV.

26:59.106 --> 27:02.109
You know,
Michelle usually comes on Wednesdays.

27:02.235 --> 27:04.152
We're switching up the schedule.

27:04.277 --> 27:06.780
- Did she call up?
- She probably talked to Donny.

27:07.614 --> 27:10.157
Miss Callahan. Clinical depression.

27:11.158 --> 27:14.994
Miss Callahan, we have a young lady
here from New England Reads.

27:20.791 --> 27:22.959
How about a little Toni Morrison?

27:23.084 --> 27:25.419
She always manages
to cheer me right up.

28:05.368 --> 28:07.120
These are incredible.

28:07.579 --> 28:08.829
Yeah.

28:27.803 --> 28:30.305
You ever been
to the Lakshmana Temple in India?

28:31.097 --> 28:33.349
Aside from a wicked brave trip
to Iowa,

28:33.474 --> 28:36.184
the farthest I've been from Haverhill
is New Hampshire.

28:36.935 --> 28:40.479
The temple there is one of
the most fascinating structures.

28:41.147 --> 28:43.316
The facade has
these detailed carvings.

28:43.441 --> 28:45.442
I asked the tour guide
what they were.

28:45.942 --> 28:47.819
Some kind of ancient legend?

28:48.320 --> 28:50.946
That's what I thought.
The guide says, no.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.741
Penises.

28:56.868 --> 28:59.369
The domes on the Temple
are phallic symbols

28:59.494 --> 29:02.956
and the carvings all depict
the act of making love.

29:05.249 --> 29:07.543
You're a freak, huh, Butler?

29:08.502 --> 29:10.670
Takes one to know one, McQueen.

29:14.173 --> 29:16.383
Everyone here is.

29:19.636 --> 29:22.096
I want to go here so bad.

29:24.098 --> 29:26.475
Yeah. Me too.

29:31.479 --> 29:33.689
Thank you for meeting with me.

29:33.814 --> 29:37.067
No, I don't judge your work, sweetie.
I'm sure it's wonderful.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.611
I help facilitate getting you here
once you've applied.

29:41.362 --> 29:44.656
Now, there are a lot of students
in your position.

29:45.365 --> 29:46.658
What do they do?

29:46.783 --> 29:50.661
Well, if your parents won't release
their income information

29:50.786 --> 29:53.705
you do have the option
to declare yourself an independent.

29:53.830 --> 29:55.247
I thought you had to be 24.

29:55.373 --> 29:58.417
Yes, unless you meet
certain criteria.

29:58.542 --> 30:01.628
The government makes exceptions
for students who are married

30:01.753 --> 30:04.963
or in the military, orphans...

30:06.173 --> 30:07.675
I'm none of those.

30:10.051 --> 30:15.430
There's also an exception for those
who can prove abuse in their home.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.518
Angela told me a little bit
about your situation.

30:21.060 --> 30:22.144
There is no shame in it.

30:22.269 --> 30:23.729
I don't...

30:24.313 --> 30:26.022
It's a lengthy legal process...

30:54.170 --> 30:56.880
Are you OK?
What happened to your eye?

30:57.005 --> 30:59.633
- I never should have come here.
- What's wrong?

30:59.758 --> 31:02.218
- I don't belong.
- That's crazy.

31:02.343 --> 31:05.887
My mother was right. McQueens don't
go to college. We stay in Haverhill.

31:06.513 --> 31:08.014
Your mother's wrong.

31:08.140 --> 31:11.434
Every day, people do hard things
because they want it bad enough.

31:11.559 --> 31:14.770
You think you'll get out of going
to your parents' alma mater?

31:16.020 --> 31:20.191
No matter what we do or say,
Exeter and Harvard is just your path,

31:20.316 --> 31:22.443
and Haverhill for life is just mine.

31:23.485 --> 31:26.028
You know, today is the most fun
I've had in years.

31:27.613 --> 31:29.323
So that would really suck.

31:35.203 --> 31:36.829
It really would.

32:20.740 --> 32:21.948
Good afternoon.

32:23.533 --> 32:26.160
I'm with New England Reads.
You want to hear a story?

32:32.332 --> 32:34.667
It's freezing in here, right?

32:43.633 --> 32:46.551
He's been here, hasn't he?
The Wraith?

32:51.972 --> 32:53.724
I'm a medium.

32:53.849 --> 32:56.768
My Scrabble bag told me he's hunting
a strong creative I know.

32:56.893 --> 32:58.311
In Haverhill.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.648
When I read about the unexplained
power outage online, I thought...

33:04.483 --> 33:05.818
Why did he visit you?

33:07.401 --> 33:09.654
Did he mention Vic McQueen?

33:11.405 --> 33:12.948
OK. It's OK.

33:15.492 --> 33:16.617
This is you?

33:17.493 --> 33:18.327
This is you?

33:19.203 --> 33:20.621
Are you a strong creative?

33:21.080 --> 33:22.163
Yeah...

33:22.914 --> 33:24.457
Are these skates your knife?

33:38.051 --> 33:40.262
He did this to you. He put you here.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.558
He's going to hurt my friend.

36:15.219 --> 36:16.595
Steve?

36:19.347 --> 36:21.140
Steve, is that you?

36:26.019 --> 36:27.521
Steve?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.070
Stop it. You're scaring me.

36:45.201 --> 36:48.621
Haley? Call 911.

38:39.668 --> 38:41.211
Are you Father Christmas?

38:41.336 --> 38:43.546
Yes, child.

38:45.547 --> 38:47.299
Rest now.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.141
- The mother?
- Yeah.

39:13.362 --> 39:14.571
Hello.

39:27.540 --> 39:30.167
Did you see the size
of that food court?

39:30.292 --> 39:32.335
Not bad for the Harvard
of Rhode Island.

39:32.460 --> 39:34.212
They let you create your own major,

39:34.337 --> 39:37.172
and you can drop a class a week
before finals.

39:37.297 --> 39:40.550
I'm gonna abuse that system
like a crackhead with food stamps.

39:42.677 --> 39:46.012
What's up with the tortured artists?
Didn't you freaks like RISD?

39:46.721 --> 39:48.306
Yeah, I loved it.

39:48.765 --> 39:51.725
Me too. I'm applying.

39:52.351 --> 39:55.604
The Doctors Butler are never going
to let that happen, brother.

39:56.104 --> 39:58.606
It's my life.
They don't get to live it for me.

39:59.607 --> 40:01.400
McQueen's applying, too.

40:02.985 --> 40:05.195
Of course you are.
And you're gonna slay.

40:15.162 --> 40:16.745
Wait. One second.

40:20.499 --> 40:21.416
Maggie.

40:21.541 --> 40:23.585
Vic, I've been calling you all day.

40:23.710 --> 40:27.004
Yeah, no. I know.
I'm in Providence, OK? I can't talk.

40:27.129 --> 40:28.589
No, the Wraith is in Haverhill.

40:28.714 --> 40:31.257
I got confirmation
from another strong creative.

40:31.382 --> 40:33.551
An old woman who he paralyzed.

40:34.135 --> 40:35.845
Where did you find her?

40:35.970 --> 40:38.263
Essex County Hospital.
The psych ward.

40:38.388 --> 40:41.098
- It's where the power outage was.
- Maggie...

40:41.223 --> 40:43.809
And I got another message
from my tiles.

40:43.934 --> 40:46.103
Does the word "smitten"
mean anything to you?

40:50.106 --> 40:51.149
No.

40:51.273 --> 40:54.526
- "Wraith hunts smitten."
- No, it doesn't mean anything.

40:54.651 --> 40:57.528
I know you don't want to hear it
but you can't run from this.

40:57.653 --> 41:00.323
Thank you for your concern.
Can you just go home?

41:00.448 --> 41:02.908
- Vic. Vic?
- Sorry. I've got to go.

41:06.493 --> 41:08.037
Vic, let's go.

41:08.829 --> 41:09.914
Ready to head home?

41:10.789 --> 41:13.625
No. I'm not.

41:18.337 --> 41:21.797
If I were to forge
my father's tax return...

41:21.923 --> 41:23.341
If...

41:24.508 --> 41:25.843
How would I do it?

41:25.968 --> 41:28.136
Ask your genius friend
and I would help you.

41:28.261 --> 41:29.846
You really think you could do it?

41:29.971 --> 41:32.306
Bitch, have you ever heard
of the internet?

41:32.431 --> 41:34.016
It can forge literally anything.

41:34.141 --> 41:36.684
We'll do it on my laptop
the second we get home.

41:36.809 --> 41:38.937
You don't owe your parents
a damn thing.

41:39.562 --> 41:42.648
They've done nothing but make you
a pawn in their shitty marriage.

41:42.773 --> 41:46.193
Don't lose out on all of this
because they're being ignorant.

41:47.151 --> 41:48.819
Break the cycle, McQueen.

42:17.592 --> 42:19.344
What's up, Brat?

42:19.469 --> 42:20.679
Hey.

42:22.263 --> 42:23.389
How was your trip?

42:23.514 --> 42:25.391
It was great.
I figured everything out.

42:25.516 --> 42:27.392
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:28.017 --> 42:29.269
I knew you would.

42:29.727 --> 42:33.146
You're way smarter
than your dumb-ass dad.

42:33.272 --> 42:34.773
How did that happen?

42:35.357 --> 42:36.984
Mom, I guess.

42:42.445 --> 42:45.115
- Love you like a big dog.
- Love you too, kiddo.

43:04.547 --> 43:05.589
Hello?

43:06.882 --> 43:10.010
Hey, Steve. No.

43:10.135 --> 43:13.554
No, I haven't seen her.
Have you checked out by the woods?

43:21.144 --> 43:22.687
I'll be right there.

43:25.147 --> 43:26.982
Come on, Maggie...

43:28.065 --> 43:30.192
- Hello?
- Maggie, it wasn't "smitten."

43:30.318 --> 43:32.111
- What?
- It wasn't "smitten."
