WEBVTT

00:05.527 --> 00:10.401
Announcer: And now your CEO,
Judy Ken Sebben.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.360
When I first took over
Sebben & Sebben,

00:12.403 --> 00:15.667
I vowed to lead us
into the 21st century...

00:16.625 --> 00:18.061
...to lead through innovation

00:18.105 --> 00:20.107
and revolutionary products.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.848
Yeah, but, uh,
those ideas sucked.

00:22.892 --> 00:23.762
Human waste!

00:23.806 --> 00:24.850
Yeah, yeah, they did.

00:24.894 --> 00:29.029
But where are we
if we don't try?

00:29.072 --> 00:31.074
Please stop doing that.

00:31.118 --> 00:34.338
Birdgirl: Board members,
I give you the FL[I],

00:34.382 --> 00:35.774
our next product --

00:35.818 --> 00:37.472
that doesn't suck.

00:39.387 --> 00:42.520
Hello. If you've ever doubted
you can be happy

00:42.564 --> 00:45.654
or that Sebben & Sebben
can make a successful product,

00:45.697 --> 00:49.571
we'd like to <i>change your mind</i>--
with FL

00:49.614 --> 00:50.267
Judy?

00:50.311 --> 00:51.921
Loosen up, will ya?

00:51.964 --> 00:53.662
What's FL[I], you ask?

00:53.705 --> 00:55.881
Well, the inspiration's
right next to me.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.623
To my left.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.713
Meredith is the most
high-functioning person I know.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.715
Her brain filters
out the negative,

01:03.759 --> 01:06.153
leaving her
in a state of total calm.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.937
Not like this
dumpster fire.

01:09.504 --> 01:13.160
Guys, I'm using self-deprecation
to seem relatable.

01:14.596 --> 01:17.729
We built these prototypes
to test in-house.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.297
Each FLis powered
by a fragment

01:20.341 --> 01:22.560
of Mere's mindtaker powers.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.388
Boy-oop!

01:24.432 --> 01:26.347
Nobody likes me.

01:26.390 --> 01:29.219
The negative thought is taken
by those powers

01:29.263 --> 01:31.178
and turned
into something better.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.745
I'm unique and special.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.399
As a young mindtaker,

01:35.443 --> 01:38.228
other people's thoughts
were overwhelming.

01:38.272 --> 01:42.276
I was obsessed with them,
controlled by them...

01:42.319 --> 01:45.409
till I learned
to take my own mind.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.979
I guess you could say
this project is important to me.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.198
To us.

01:51.241 --> 01:54.157
And now you can stop
looking at me

01:54.201 --> 01:56.159
and us.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.903
What the fuck was that?

02:00.946 --> 02:02.557
♪ Hey!

02:02.600 --> 02:04.124
♪ Who's the girl
that saves the world? ♪

02:04.167 --> 02:05.560
♪ Hey!

02:05.603 --> 02:06.952
♪ Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God ♪

02:06.996 --> 02:09.041
Birdgirl!

02:09.085 --> 02:10.173
Meredith:
They liked it!

02:10.217 --> 02:11.435
They really liked it.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.045
You really know
how to handle the board.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.090
All human relations, really.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.265
It's kind of creepy.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.266
Am I saying
"really" a lot?

02:16.310 --> 02:17.267
Not really.

02:17.311 --> 02:18.529
Oh, and it's not me.

02:18.573 --> 02:21.358
It's my secret weapon --
my Leadership Stick!

02:21.402 --> 02:23.099
I got it when I went
to New Zealand to visit

02:23.143 --> 02:26.058
that remote Maori village...
on QVC.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.669
God, I love hotel TV.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.454
Anytime I succeed,
it's because of the Stick.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.804
Anytime I fail,
it's my own fault.

02:32.848 --> 02:33.805
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.459
Lot to unpack there.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.939
I'd be a wreck without her.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.768
Her name's "Bith,"
which is "Beth" in New Zealand.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.684
Hold her.
Feel the power of Bith.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.512
Would love to,

02:44.555 --> 02:47.036
but we need to divide
and conquer to launch this baby.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.211
Then we meet for lunch.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.126
Salad! Salad.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.214
Did I lose you
with salad?

02:51.258 --> 02:52.650
I know
that's a trigger word.

02:52.694 --> 02:56.176
No, no, that's all great.
But I actually have a thing.

02:57.394 --> 03:00.310
Mind your own beeswax, Hank.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.312
A <i>Sebbentown</i> thing.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.748
I thought
we destroyed it.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.663
We did.
But then we rebuilt it,

03:05.707 --> 03:06.882
which you'll
be stumbling across

03:06.925 --> 03:08.623
in next quarter's
earnings report.

03:08.666 --> 03:12.235
You've been spending money
that's not ours again. Yay.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.063
Something major's
going down there,

03:14.106 --> 03:15.630
and I feel
kind of responsible

03:15.673 --> 03:17.327
since they have
a statue of me

03:17.371 --> 03:20.112
and we blew
some of their limbs off.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.592
They were definitely
asking for it.

03:21.636 --> 03:24.682
Think maybe you can launch
the FLon your own

03:24.726 --> 03:26.510
in addition
to your normal work duties

03:26.554 --> 03:28.033
and also some of mine?

03:28.077 --> 03:29.470
Um, sure.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.646
I mean, you are
the half of the team

03:31.689 --> 03:33.038
who talks to people
and drives things

03:33.082 --> 03:35.040
with your limitless energy
and terrifying title,

03:35.084 --> 03:39.610
but if this Sebbentown thing
is really that important...

03:39.654 --> 03:41.656
Gillian:
Hank! Beeswax!

03:41.699 --> 03:43.266
Ooh!
You stopped talking. Great.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.225
You can borrow Bith,
guaranteed to make you

03:45.268 --> 03:47.009
an awesome leader
or my money back.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.315
Yeah, thanks, but no.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.317
I think
I'll fly this one solo.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.753
R-i-i-ight.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.103
You don't need anyone's help,
especially mine.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.365
I'll just drag you down.

03:55.409 --> 03:58.412
Totally. Dumpster fire.
You. Obviously.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.546
You sure you don't
want me to stay?

04:02.590 --> 04:04.156
It seems like
you want me to stay.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.986
If that's what it seems like,
it's not what it seems.

04:08.030 --> 04:10.206
So...
you want me to stay?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.687
Do you want to stay?

04:12.730 --> 04:15.037
Yes.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.778
No.
Yes.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.043
Birdgirl!

04:21.086 --> 04:23.785
Hey! I need your John Hancock
on these SEC forms,

04:23.828 --> 04:25.830
and I'm transferring
a bunch of Judy's appointments

04:25.874 --> 04:26.962
to your MindCal.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.226
And synched.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.361
Unified field,
unified force.

04:34.404 --> 04:37.494
Judy hates that, too.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.846
I need your Ollie Wolcott
on a B-day card

04:41.890 --> 04:43.370
for Sarah
from Social Responsibility.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.719
My what? For whom?

04:44.762 --> 04:46.286
Sarah. She guards
the expectant mothers

04:46.329 --> 04:47.722
parking space.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.332
You know, gets a lot of money
on towing fees.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.681
This sounds like
a Judy problem.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.683
It's not a problem.
It's a birthday.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.250
Oh, were your
birthdays problems?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.295
Let's get into it.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.905
Oh, good.
You're on video.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.776
<i>I scheduled your bathroom break</i> <i>
for an hour ago,</i>

04:58.820 --> 05:00.952
<i>and your CEO office hours</i> <i>
start in 15 minutes.</i>

05:00.996 --> 05:03.346
You can sign right between
the hugging dinosaurs.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.956
Nothing sexual.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.131
<i>1-5, One-fiver.</i>

05:06.175 --> 05:07.611
<i>I left 2 minutes</i> <i>
wiggle room.</i>

05:07.655 --> 05:08.873
Gillian, I missed
the bathroom break,

05:08.917 --> 05:10.440
and tell the employees
I'm running late,

05:10.484 --> 05:12.137
and, Paul, we're pushing
the B.D. to next Tuesday.

05:12.181 --> 05:15.271
<i>Ooh! Tuesday's when Judy --</i> <i>
now you --</i>

05:15.315 --> 05:16.577
<i>runs urine tests.</i>

05:16.620 --> 05:18.143
<i>She's very hands-on.</i>

05:18.187 --> 05:19.144
<i>How's Wednesday?</i>

05:19.188 --> 05:20.276
Push a birthday?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.278
You are a monster!

05:22.322 --> 05:24.019
Thursday it is.

05:24.802 --> 05:27.675
She was more beautiful
than thy first love

05:27.718 --> 05:30.634
but now lies under boards.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.466
That's it -- the last bit
of Baltimo on Earth.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.903
Except for what's still
in the mines, right?

05:38.947 --> 05:39.904
God damn it!

05:39.948 --> 05:41.210
Forgot about that.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.820
You better get up there
and blow up what's left

05:42.864 --> 05:45.954
before some Erin Brockotits
sniffs it out.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.825
Brockotits...
She in marketing?

05:47.869 --> 05:51.394
Take the white Festiva
in spot for 422.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.526
Festiva?
Wait.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.702
I-Is this
a Birdteam mission?

05:54.745 --> 05:56.530
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.620
Nor, alas, do I care.

05:59.663 --> 06:00.751
I'm on the Birdteam.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.579
New personal record.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.501
<i>Oh, my God, I can't believe</i> <i>
I gained 2 pounds this week.</i>

06:11.545 --> 06:13.068
<i>I hope that no one notices.</i>

06:13.111 --> 06:15.375
<i>Why did I get my mom's body?!</i>

06:19.640 --> 06:21.032
<i>Millions of years of evolution</i>

06:21.076 --> 06:23.121
<i>shaped my body</i> <i>
for optimal fecundity.</i>

06:23.165 --> 06:25.515
<i>I am perfect.</i>

06:25.559 --> 06:27.387
Oh, God, is that a gray?

06:29.650 --> 06:32.000
<i>Are people creeped out by me?</i>

06:33.654 --> 06:35.743
<i>No, Paul,</i> <i>
you're a necessary discomfort</i>

06:35.786 --> 06:37.309
<i>for the sake of growth.</i>

06:37.353 --> 06:39.442
That's right. Breathe.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.314
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

06:42.358 --> 06:44.752
<i>I'll never have</i> <i>
a vaginal orgasm.</i>

06:46.884 --> 06:50.758
<i>Even Lady Diana needed</i> <i>
clitoral stimulation.</i>

06:50.801 --> 06:53.195
<i>But at least</i> <i>
she was a squirter.</i>

06:57.852 --> 06:59.157
Dog With Bucket Hat: <i>
Hello, Brian.</i>

06:59.201 --> 07:01.290
<i>Welcome to</i> <i>
the 1993 Ford Festiva</i>

07:01.333 --> 07:02.813
<i>with a GL sport package.</i>

07:02.857 --> 07:05.512
<i>You'll notice a bomb</i> <i>
in the rear compartment.</i>

07:05.555 --> 07:06.904
Rear compartment...

07:06.948 --> 07:08.253
<i>Back seat.</i>

07:08.297 --> 07:10.517
<i>Press the red button</i> <i>
to activate it.</i>

07:10.560 --> 07:12.432
<i>Before you press the button,</i>

07:12.475 --> 07:13.737
<i>I've allowed you 2 minutes</i>

07:13.781 --> 07:15.086
<i>since that's the time</i> <i>
it took me</i>

07:15.130 --> 07:17.262
<i>to exit the car,</i> <i>
pop the back seat,</i>

07:17.306 --> 07:19.264
<i>and locate the adjuster bar.</i>

07:19.308 --> 07:21.179
<i>As long as you follow</i> <i>
my timing,</i>

07:21.223 --> 07:23.878
<i>the bomb's set</i> <i>
to perfectly explode.</i>

07:23.921 --> 07:27.272
What if I have to go
number one and a half?

07:27.316 --> 07:29.753
So that's how the Birdteam
does it -- in a canister.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.669
<i>Nobody but you</i> <i>
does it in a canister.</i>

07:34.018 --> 07:36.586
Meredith: Huh.
It's working!

07:36.630 --> 07:38.153
Evie:
Yeah, yeah, it is,

07:38.196 --> 07:40.285
but I'm keeping my eye
on a few hotspots.

07:41.504 --> 07:42.723
I hate humanity.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.116
Charlie:
Wait till you hit your 20s.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.032
<i>Board meeting</i> <i>
in less than a minute.</i>

07:48.076 --> 07:50.600
But ---
I don't talk in front of people.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.297
That's Judy's jam. <i>You do now.</i>

07:52.341 --> 07:55.126
My jam is to make fun of them
in my head while she's talking.

07:55.170 --> 07:57.477
<i>And you're presenting</i> <i>
this quarter's projections.</i>

07:57.520 --> 07:58.739
<i>You better</i> <i>
get-a-typin' there.</i>

07:58.782 --> 08:00.175
You gonna eat that?

08:01.655 --> 08:04.092
Sorry
I'm a tad late.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.529
Uh, just pulling up
the old presentation,

08:06.573 --> 08:08.879
which, of course,
I finished already.

08:08.923 --> 08:12.143
Can we, uh, get to the actuals
and year-to-date projections?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.797
Actuals, huh?

08:13.841 --> 08:15.625
Says here some thoughts
aren't getting --

08:15.669 --> 08:17.975
-
fixed.

08:18.019 --> 08:20.543
Your system's
at or near capacity.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.501
We dealing with that?

08:21.544 --> 08:23.981
Uh... Yes, we are...

08:24.025 --> 08:26.331
addressing those concerns with...

08:26.375 --> 08:28.899
our new...concierge service...

08:28.943 --> 08:31.598
...is what it's called,
and, uh --

08:31.641 --> 08:34.383
w-where we -- I --
will personally filter

08:34.426 --> 08:38.518
the users' thoughts
for them...s-so easily.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.389
Boy-oop!

08:40.432 --> 08:41.825
System: <i>
Mindtake override.</i>

08:41.869 --> 08:42.870
Evie: Hey!

08:42.913 --> 08:44.828
Are you bypassing
the system

08:44.872 --> 08:47.527
so all the red-liners
go directly through your mind?

08:47.570 --> 08:49.529
Yeah.
Is that a bad idea?

08:49.572 --> 08:50.530
Nope!

08:50.573 --> 08:52.009
Ha! An upcharge.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.794
This is bullshit!

08:53.837 --> 08:55.622
That's him
as the consumer.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.276
Oh, gross!
I'm sweating?!

08:59.321 --> 09:00.583
<i>Meredith?</i>

09:00.627 --> 09:03.194
<i>Meredith, this is Paul --</i> <i>
not R.</i>

09:03.238 --> 09:07.111
<i>You're needed at</i> <i>
the card-signing station.</i>

09:27.610 --> 09:28.568
Oof!

09:29.873 --> 09:31.832
Birdgirl -- thank God!

09:31.875 --> 09:33.573
Oh.
Where have you been?

09:33.616 --> 09:34.878
If it's an emergency,

09:34.922 --> 09:36.750
there are faster ways
of communicating.

09:36.793 --> 09:37.881
Maybe try texting
next time.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.107
Oh, good.
She didn't do the Sudoku.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.243
Brian: Brockotits, Brockotits...
I know that name.

09:52.287 --> 09:55.333
Dog With Bucket Hat: <i>Now, Brian,</i> <i>
I'm imagining right about now</i>

09:55.377 --> 09:57.640
<i>you're feeling</i> <i>
a little peckish.</i>

09:57.684 --> 10:02.602
<i>But whatever you do,</i> <i>
don't stop for the pastrami.</i>

10:11.654 --> 10:14.222
Welcome,
my road-weary friend!

10:14.265 --> 10:16.920
Allow us to make
your visit...magical.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.097
That shit
is pretty magical.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.622
One pastrami,
two sweet teas -- to go.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.928
Excellent choice.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.278
Well, are you sure
we can't tempt you to...

10:27.322 --> 10:28.932
dine in?

10:28.976 --> 10:31.587
<i>And, Brian,</i> <i>
if you do stop,</i>

10:31.631 --> 10:34.459
<i>don't dine in.</i>

10:34.503 --> 10:36.853
Sure.
Something near the stage.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.116
Paul: <i>
$15 reward for information</i>

10:39.160 --> 10:41.118
leading to the location
of Meredith.

10:41.162 --> 10:44.121
<i>Contact Paul -- not R --</i> <i>
in the lobby.</i>

10:44.165 --> 10:47.472
Concierge service.
Nice one, Mere.

10:47.516 --> 10:48.648
Nun-unh!

10:48.691 --> 10:50.693
Only Judy crosses
that threshold.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.608
Shut up.
I need something in her office.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.958
What?
I need
the Leadership Stick,

10:55.002 --> 10:57.569
and I need it now, Gillian.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.614
Greg: Where is she?

10:59.746 --> 11:01.182
Ooh, ooh!
I may have some idea.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.662
She's getting
her legs reshaven.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.054
That's a sexist
first guess.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.534
She's eating wings
even though she told us

11:05.577 --> 11:06.535
she was vegan this week.

11:06.578 --> 11:07.667
We really doing this?

11:07.710 --> 11:08.798
- She's with Psychic Susan.
- Nope.

11:08.842 --> 11:09.930
She's shorting stock. No.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.453
- She's cracking a cold case.
- Not.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.281
She's putting in time
- on the speed bag.
- What?

11:13.324 --> 11:14.978
She's getting
- both her lazy eyes fixed.
- You're a pervert.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.545
She's getting
- her captain's license.
- Mnh-mnh.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.155
She's getting her
- third mole removed.
- Half a mole.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.070
She's taking modeling classes
at John Robert Powers

11:20.114 --> 11:21.985
so she can be
on "America's Top Model."

11:24.422 --> 11:28.035
Everyone, Meredith --
acting CEO in name only --

11:28.078 --> 11:30.298
will be able to answer
all your questions.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.736
This isn't over, Pinky.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.086
Evie:
I warned them.

11:36.130 --> 11:39.655
And now it's come to pass.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.222
4:30?

11:41.265 --> 11:43.615
Goddamn.
I should be home by now.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.182
Ms. Concierge?

11:45.226 --> 11:46.836
Yes?
One of the VIPs

11:46.880 --> 11:49.796
took her FLhome and is now
having night terrors.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.841
Wild guess.
Denise from finance?

11:51.885 --> 11:54.148
She wasn't supposed
to bring her FLhome.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.846
Switch the feed. Try "cuddling
with cat on futon."

11:56.890 --> 11:58.761
I did.
Now I'm running

11:58.805 --> 12:00.023
"Folksy antique store."

12:00.067 --> 12:01.895
Nothing's working.
Connecting you.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.548
<i>What'll get me first --</i>

12:03.592 --> 12:06.595
<i>the melanoma</i> <i>
or that son of a bitch David?</i>

12:06.638 --> 12:08.162
<i>I'm sure he gave me cancer!</i>

12:08.205 --> 12:10.642
<i>He's secretly</i> <i>
trying to kill me!</i>

12:10.686 --> 12:14.255
Whoa!
Denise 651, chill.

12:15.386 --> 12:16.866
Maybe David will get
the melanoma.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.086
Ever think of that?

12:20.914 --> 12:23.351
I need Stick!

12:28.399 --> 12:30.184
Not to be that guy,
but I'm a little concerned

12:30.227 --> 12:32.360
about your reliance
on single-use plastics.

12:32.403 --> 12:35.015
I'm gonna be that guy.
Imagine a fork in a dolphin.

12:35.058 --> 12:38.801
I always recycle.
It's part of my weltanschauung.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.585
Paul:
But it isn't recycled.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.239
It's put on a cargo ship

12:42.283 --> 12:44.241
that endlessly
sails around the world

12:44.285 --> 12:46.417
because no one
wants our garbage anymore!

12:46.461 --> 12:49.203
But it's not garbage.
It's recycling, Paul.

12:49.246 --> 12:52.380
Well, tell that to an exaltation
of turtles, Single Use!

12:52.423 --> 12:54.991
Meredith:
Just need another 6 inches.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.254
And we have launch.

13:00.518 --> 13:01.737
I'm not attacking you.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.434
That's just
my walnutschlong.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.262
I didn't say
you were attacking me.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.438
I said I <i>felt</i> attacked.

13:07.482 --> 13:10.093
Clearly, you've never been
to family therapy.

13:12.661 --> 13:13.967
It's you and me, Bith.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.796
You're late
for conflict mediation

13:16.839 --> 13:19.146
with Mandy and Lyle in 4-A,
apple.

13:19.189 --> 13:23.846
Every day there's a storm,
worse than the one before.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.936
Snow in July. Huh.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.895
This isn't snow.
It's --

13:28.938 --> 13:30.157
It's a variant
of Baltimo.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.724
Highly addictive.
You can't eat it.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.465
I think
we've established that.

13:34.509 --> 13:35.945
But who'd want to

13:35.989 --> 13:38.992
once you find out
how fun it is to snort it?

13:40.036 --> 13:41.255
Really harsh comedown,

13:41.298 --> 13:43.648
which is why
to never stop doing it.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.302
Whoo!

13:45.346 --> 13:47.174
We've got to trace
the source of this.

13:47.217 --> 13:48.436
Genius Scientist:
The EMF's spiking.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.307
Baltimo readings
through the roof.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.961
The sewers.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.311
- Oh, we don't have sewers.
- Just shit ponds.

13:54.355 --> 13:58.011
Those are access shafts
to the old Baltimo mine.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.577
We could follow those,

13:59.621 --> 14:03.320
and they might lead to something
approaching a solution.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.192
Why'd you wink?

14:06.019 --> 14:07.498
I'm flirting.

14:07.542 --> 14:11.415
We did equal work
rewriting the user manual,

14:11.459 --> 14:15.985
but Mandy's taking 100% of
the credit like she always does.

14:16.029 --> 14:19.859
- I hate you so very deeply.
- Screw you! Screw you! Screw you!

14:19.902 --> 14:21.425
I think
we're getting somewhere!

14:21.469 --> 14:24.689
How do you work
this G.D. thing?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.082
I haven't peed in 24 hours,

14:26.126 --> 14:27.779
and I've been holding in
a fart since this morning,

14:27.823 --> 14:30.130
which is really impressive
because I had oatmeal.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.871
Oops!
Sorry.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.264
I thought I was
calling Paul R.

14:37.354 --> 14:41.358
Well, unfortunately,
we are <i>cash-only.</i>

14:41.402 --> 14:44.231
<i>And, Brian,</i> <i>
if you do dine in,</i>

14:44.274 --> 14:47.190
<i>make sure you have cash.</i>

14:50.193 --> 14:52.804
I don't usually do this,
but I'm, well...

14:54.110 --> 14:55.764
...I'm part
of the Birdteam.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.723
Naturally, you've heard of us,
but you'll deny it, of course.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.638
I'm on a VIP
secret mission.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.206
The Champagne Room of missions,
if you will.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.469
So what say you forgive
my small debt

15:05.513 --> 15:09.038
in exchange for a selfie
and a shout-out on my Insta?

15:09.082 --> 15:12.912
I wish you hadn't said that.
Now I have no choice.

15:12.955 --> 15:17.133
You will have to dance it off
like the rest of them!

15:22.922 --> 15:25.098
Meredith: Boy-oop!
Boy-oop!

15:25.141 --> 15:27.230
Come on, Judy, pick up.

15:27.274 --> 15:28.928
Mere!
How's tricks?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.451
Super.
Just out of curiosity --

15:30.494 --> 15:31.495
no big deal --

15:31.539 --> 15:33.933
when were you planning
to come back?

15:33.976 --> 15:36.326
What?
Reception's so bad up here.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.851
Quick follow-up.
How do you use Bith?

15:39.895 --> 15:41.766
One sec.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.246
Nothing fits!

15:43.290 --> 15:45.031
Denise, hold.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.075
Judy --

15:46.119 --> 15:47.120
You're needed
at reception.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.599
Excuse me?
Miss?

15:48.643 --> 15:49.600
Can you mix patterns?

15:49.644 --> 15:51.907
I wouldn't.
Sorry. Who's this?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.954
Everyone, shut up.
I can't think.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.781
Get down here!

15:56.825 --> 15:57.957
They're tonguing each other!

15:58.000 --> 15:59.871
This is a sight to witness!

15:59.915 --> 16:01.264
Hey, paws off, guys.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.963
Last I checked,
Birdgirl was on Sebbentown time.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.834
Mere? Mere!

16:05.877 --> 16:09.490
Meredith:
I...can't do this.

16:14.712 --> 16:17.802
- Ow!
- Find somebody else to touch your back fat!

16:17.846 --> 16:21.676
And now a treat that's sure
to delight and arouse.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.026
Ladies,
make noise with your hands

16:24.070 --> 16:28.117
and those mouths for Brian,
the Handsy Boss!

16:29.510 --> 16:32.121
I hope the stripper
isn't grossed out by me.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.167
Did I powder today?

16:34.210 --> 16:39.650
Meredith: They're all so weak,
so spiteful, so pitiful.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.304
A little smelly.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.653
I can't handle this.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.047
Jessica: <i>Did I powder today?</i>

16:45.091 --> 16:47.484
Aah!

16:47.528 --> 16:50.270
I can't turn off this much!

16:57.016 --> 16:59.192
100% pure Baltimo.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.324
Pure poison.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.153
It's so beautiful.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.415
Please don't snort that.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.332
He's gone.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.031
The blob --
it's highly unstable.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.207
That's no blob.
It's an egg,

17:14.250 --> 17:15.730
and it's about to crack.

17:15.773 --> 17:16.861
We don't have much time.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.603
But we do have...this.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.041
Okay, that's cool.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.346
It's a late
birthday present.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.175
You really are
hard to shop for.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.396
Evie:
The whole system's melting down!

17:29.439 --> 17:31.354
It's what
we always feared.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.357
I can't believe I'm about to say
this, but we need Birdgirl.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.230
I'm part of the problem.
I use recyclable straw!

17:37.273 --> 17:39.536
Ugh!
Where are the bird-suits again?

17:39.580 --> 17:42.670
People think I smell
like I wear a corset!

17:44.498 --> 17:45.629
Stop!

17:46.935 --> 17:49.198
It's him.
He's back.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.202
Wait for me
in the Festiva.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.119
Ronnie,
you know what to do.

18:00.775 --> 18:02.559
Hello, old friend.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.614
Never ask
what happened in there.

18:14.441 --> 18:17.792
Let's just say
your debt is paid.

18:19.010 --> 18:22.579
I am born again.

18:22.623 --> 18:26.409
Something that wants to destroy
our very way of life

18:26.453 --> 18:28.194
is about to come out
of that mine.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.065
We must fight to survive.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.719
Who's with me?

18:33.460 --> 18:35.940
8-Balt to the first
10 volunteers.

18:39.814 --> 18:42.295
What the actual fuck?

18:44.166 --> 18:47.430
Um, Birdgirl,
for your to-do list,

18:47.474 --> 18:51.042
how about you teach one of us
how to fly this thing?

18:51.086 --> 18:54.176
What...is that?

18:54.220 --> 18:56.135
Whatever that is
can wait.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.180
Judy, Mere needs you.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.008
Oh, my God, Mere.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.797
Should've used
the Leadership Stick.

19:06.841 --> 19:10.323
I do feel awful about what the
company has done to your town.

19:10.366 --> 19:13.064
Again.
But I must go now

19:13.108 --> 19:16.720
and leave you in the capable
hands of the Birdteam

19:16.764 --> 19:19.114
who will protect you
until I return.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.509
Get behind us, people!

19:22.552 --> 19:26.817
Yes, people. Do that.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.559
I shall return!

19:32.954 --> 19:34.303
Cut.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.653
Birdgirl's left
Sebbentown air space.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.612
We're clear. Cut.

19:38.655 --> 19:41.702
Mayor:
No wonder she left.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.791
Your act two break
was horrible.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.185
You went to
all this trouble

19:46.228 --> 19:49.057
to create a fake
Birdgirl adventure?

19:49.100 --> 19:52.147
Hilarious.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.497
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're amused?

19:54.541 --> 19:57.021
We blew the town pension
on Maldon

19:57.065 --> 19:58.458
and coc-a-ine balls.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.677
She'd come up here
for a bag of bagels.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.331
Guess we could've used
prop drugs.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.986
You had one job.

20:05.029 --> 20:08.468
To create a world where Birdgirl
was forever our savior

20:08.511 --> 20:11.210
and us her loyal followers
as God and nature intended,

20:11.253 --> 20:12.646
but you blew it.

20:12.689 --> 20:16.693
Yeah, I'm not sure Birdgirl
will see the charm in this.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.957
Maybe we don't mention it to her
if and when we see her again.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.322
Paul: <i>Hey, Meredith, Sarah's</i> <i>
birthday's in 10 minutes,</i>

20:36.365 --> 20:39.063
<i>and I just wanted to let you
know we have everything we need</i>

20:39.107 --> 20:41.283
<i>except your fucking</i> <i>
John Hancock!</i>

20:41.327 --> 20:42.371
<i>Okay, I'm out the door.</i>

20:45.287 --> 20:47.071
Meredith: Make it stop.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.291
Make it stop.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.901
I got you, Mere.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.381
I got you.

20:52.425 --> 20:55.341
<i>Password "Salad" approved.</i>

20:55.384 --> 20:57.430
<i>FLsystem shutting down.</i>

20:57.473 --> 20:58.648
What's going on?

20:58.692 --> 21:00.868
Oh, Mere, honey,
I'm so sorry.

21:00.911 --> 21:04.698
I had no idea you needed me,
like, really needed me,

21:04.741 --> 21:06.352
and I wasn't here for you.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.311
I did ask,
in a non-asking way.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.660
Guess I expected you
to notice,

21:10.704 --> 21:12.967
but you didn't because
you're a dumpster fire

21:13.010 --> 21:16.405
and so am I, I guess.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.756
I hate your job, Jude.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.933
And you're the only one
who can do it.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.457
It's just a stick.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.938
Your real Leadership Stick
is in here.

21:31.159 --> 21:32.203
Oh, God.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.423
You just snapped her in...

21:34.467 --> 21:36.338
It's okay, it's okay.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.253
Wait, what happened with
the Sebbentown thing?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.386
That wasn't important.

21:40.429 --> 21:41.778
Well, it kinda was.

21:41.822 --> 21:44.520
A lot of people died,
I think.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.174
Way to make me feel bad.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.437
I'll make it up to them,
and you.

21:48.481 --> 21:49.873
Always do.

21:49.917 --> 21:53.137
There's one thing
I have to do first.

22:00.710 --> 22:04.932
And that's why women
shouldn't be CEOs.
