Maria, turn down that radio!

00:43.627 --> 00:45.800
Today's the day
I'm going to camp.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.344
Mom, did you hear me?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.604
I'm going to camp today.

00:54.763 --> 00:55.810
Yeah, I heard you.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.441
What do you want
me to do about it?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.902
Aren't you gonna walk me
to the bus or anything?

01:02.187 --> 01:04.485
At 6:30 in the
fucking morning?

01:04.982 --> 01:07.531
Why don't you shut up
and turn down the noise?

01:07.859 --> 01:10.612
- Hey, shut up.
- No, you shut up.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.954
You both shut up.
I'm going to camp.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.918
I might never come back.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.369
- Good.
- Good.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.875
Fuck you.

04:51.082 --> 04:54.302
Hello, I'm Toni Richards
with the WXIA news team.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.463
We're here at
Camp New Horizons,

04:56.630 --> 04:59.474
where an autumn retreat
called an experiment in sharing

04:59.633 --> 05:00.725
is about to begin.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.010
Let's meet the owners
of the camp,

05:02.177 --> 05:03.770
Herman and Lily Miranda.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.978
Herman, tell us about this
wonderful and unique experiment.

05:07.349 --> 05:11.070
Well, Toni, we brung together
two specially selected groups

05:11.228 --> 05:13.447
from all over America.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.859
The first group is from the
higher-class establishments

05:17.025 --> 05:20.245
and the other is from
lower-class homes.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.705
Lilly, what are you
trying to accomplish?

05:22.864 --> 05:25.913
In our own little way
we'd like to promote sharing,

05:26.076 --> 05:28.670
love, harmony and peace,
and a better understanding

05:28.829 --> 05:30.831
between the rich and the poor.
Thank you.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.341
And thank you.
Let's meet the kids.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.262
Hello, my name is
Cindy Hammersmith

05:37.420 --> 05:38.797
from Venuity, Georgia.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.548
Thank you, Cindy.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.973
Greg Nakashima.
Westwood, California.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.513
Okay, Greg.
Move it along.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.601
Jan Hernandez,
Palm View, Arizona.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.823
Peter Doyle.
Houston Heights, Texas.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.154
Thank you, Peter.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.538
Bobby Stark.
Western Springs, Illinois.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.414
Home of the
Western Springs Wildcats!

06:06.074 --> 06:09.169
Hi, Marsha Holland.
Defiance, Ohio.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.964
Well, let's see who we have
in our second group of kids.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.178
Excuse me.
Your name, please?

06:20.171 --> 06:22.640
A-Rad.
San Francisco.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.051
Do you have
a last name, A-Rad?

06:26.261 --> 06:27.604
No.
Do I need one?

06:28.930 --> 06:29.931
Right.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.560
- And you?
- Snowboy.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.274
From Chicago.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.158
Anita Bertram.
Sautel Gap, Kentucky.

06:43.028 --> 06:45.281
Riff.
Detroit.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.830
Tony De Herrara,
East L.A.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.751
Maria Nicostro.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.174
Where are you from,
Maria?

06:56.333 --> 06:59.052
Um, all over.
Right now, New York.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.841
Why don't you take
your glasses off

07:01.004 --> 07:02.722
so your parents can
see your pretty face.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.680
Well, what interesting kids.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.149
God, that Tony guy
is so cute.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.820
He's Mexican.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.321
Ironically,
Camp New Horizons

07:22.484 --> 07:24.578
was formerly known
as Camp Rolling Hills,

07:24.736 --> 07:27.615
where last year 19 people
were brutally slain

07:27.781 --> 07:29.954
by alleged psychopath
Angela Baker.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.377
Baker, also known as
the Angel of Death,

07:32.535 --> 07:34.663
was allegedly responsible
for another string of

07:34.829 --> 07:38.379
grisly murders seven years
ago at nearby Camp Arawak,

07:38.541 --> 07:40.134
which has since closed.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.295
Things have changed here.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.759
We're now under
new ownership.

07:43.922 --> 07:44.764
- Stop, please.
- New management.

07:44.923 --> 07:45.890
New ownership.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.801
Honey, what is the matter?

07:48.343 --> 07:52.314
You told me you wouldn't say
a word about the murders.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.894
It's okay, dear.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.650
If violence sells
then you've gotta

07:55.809 --> 07:57.186
give the people
what they want.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.478
Okay.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.899
Come along, everyone.
Come along.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.863
Let's go to the dining hall

08:04.025 --> 08:07.370
and experience
some more sharing.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.499
This is a bunch of lunatics.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.285
I'll see you after lunch, okay?

08:13.702 --> 08:15.420
Oh, excuse me.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.379
Excuse me.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.132
You look a little
older than the rest.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.548
Massive drugs.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.263
Drugs, huh?

08:30.301 --> 08:32.303
You wouldn't know where
I could score some coke?

08:33.429 --> 08:34.932
Yeah, there's a machine
in the dining hall.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.482
Very funny.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.859
I just need a gram.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.442
It's already been a
real shit of a day,

08:41.604 --> 08:42.775
you know what I mean?

08:45.066 --> 08:48.570
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.575
One of the many dangers
of being a drug addict

08:53.742 --> 08:56.211
is never really knowing
if the stuff is pure.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.922
- Thanks, guy. See you.
- Okay, see you later.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.228
Here.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.567
- It's a little much, isn't it?
- It's a gift.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.227
You're my favorite
newscaster.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.488
- Pretty good stuff?
- It'll really clean your pipes.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.823
- Happy camping.
- Thanks.

09:25.982 --> 09:26.983
Have a nice life.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.582
God.
What's left of it.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.886
It's just a firecracker.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.768
You city broads should
be used to that.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.069
Alright.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.737
Testing, testing.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.572
Welcome, everyone.

10:51.734 --> 10:55.864
Welcome to the camp
of caring and sharing,

10:56.030 --> 10:57.498
Camp New Horizons!

10:57.949 --> 10:58.950
Thank you.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.253
Would everyone
take a seat, please?

11:06.875 --> 11:07.922
Can I sit here?

11:08.585 --> 11:09.928
It's not my table.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.427
Hi. Bobby Stark.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.263
Okay if I sit with you?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.844
Drop dead, fag.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.604
Hi.
I'm Bobby Stark.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.613
Is this seat taken?

11:32.275 --> 11:33.948
That's not real, is it?

11:36.905 --> 11:37.952
Cool, man.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.370
No sweat, man.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.336
Hi. Bobby Stark.
Mind if I join you?

11:47.540 --> 11:48.712
Sure.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.260
Cool.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.056
Your name's
Maria Nicostro, right?

11:56.674 --> 11:58.221
How'd you remember that?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.311
I'm just great with names.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.597
That's how I got to be senior
class president

12:02.805 --> 12:03.852
of my high school.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.185
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.108
So...

12:10.271 --> 12:11.864
You're underprivileged, huh?

12:13.608 --> 12:14.860
Alright, everyone.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.152
Let's get started.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.126
Could you turn that off?

12:25.119 --> 12:26.166
Please?

12:29.332 --> 12:31.630
Thank you.
Thank you.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.884
Herman will be
handing out camp shirts

12:35.046 --> 12:36.423
for all of you to wear.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.342
That way you'll all
look the same

12:39.509 --> 12:41.011
and you won't
feel different.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.934
As soon as our
third counselor arrives,

12:44.097 --> 12:47.442
we'll be splitting up
into three groups.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.647
And each group will stay with
each other for three days.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.948
During that time, each group

12:54.148 --> 12:56.276
will be camping
out in the woods.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.451
And we'll be getting to know
and understand each other

13:00.613 --> 13:01.830
as best we can.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.618
- Um, excuse me.
- Yes, Cindy?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.996
What do you mean
by camping out?

13:08.162 --> 13:09.880
Well, you know,
sleeping in tents,

13:10.039 --> 13:11.962
cooking your own
food, hiking.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.631
Well, like, what are we
supposed to do if

13:13.793 --> 13:16.046
we have to go to the
bathroom or take a shower?

13:16.421 --> 13:19.721
Oh, well there are outdoor
toilets by every campsite

13:19.882 --> 13:21.805
and we'll be washing
up in the lake.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.219
You're kidding.

13:26.639 --> 13:30.314
- What are we gonna eat?
- Fish, mostly.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.400
- Oh, shit.
- We'll be catching them.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.314
Fish is good for you.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.482
And besides,
it's better for our budget.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.448
Now remember,
the first three days

13:39.610 --> 13:41.453
you will be in your
smaller groups

13:41.612 --> 13:43.330
and after that for the
remaining two days

13:43.489 --> 13:45.412
we'll all be together.
Are there any questions?

13:45.992 --> 13:49.667
Yeah. Do the guys
get to sleep with the girls?

13:52.749 --> 13:55.719
- No.
. Well, why not?

13:56.669 --> 13:59.468
Because, because...

14:00.423 --> 14:02.767
They're afraid we'll fuck.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.931
Oh, let's all sing a
rousing camp song.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.691
Does anyone know
"I'm a Happy Camper"?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.148
- I do.
- Good.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.814
That must be Barney.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.450
- Barney?
- Barney Rubble?

14:21.152 --> 14:22.779
No, Barney Whitmore.

14:30.661 --> 14:34.416
Everybody, I'd like for you
to meet our third counselor

14:34.582 --> 14:37.335
Officer Barney Whitmore!

14:42.006 --> 14:43.007
HI!

14:44.092 --> 14:45.093
Sorry I'm late.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.478
I guess I'll have to <i>catch</i> up
on all the names later.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.104
Are you a cop?

14:49.889 --> 14:50.856
Yes.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.527
Hey, you got a problem?

15:03.277 --> 15:04.950
Suck my dick, spic.

15:05.113 --> 15:05.989
Motherfucker.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.018
Any more shit like this and

15:28.219 --> 15:29.687
I'll have your butt
in jail so fast

15:29.846 --> 15:32.395
you won't know what happened.
You got it?

15:34.475 --> 15:35.476
Asshole.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.028
Anybody else
carrying anything?

15:46.195 --> 15:47.572
If you are give it to me now.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.538
Same goes for you
goes for him.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.959
Now sit down.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.458
Behave yourself.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.382
Wow.
This is better than T.V.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.771
Hurry up, girls!
We have a lot to do!

16:25.818 --> 16:27.570
There's no electricity.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.749
Hey, gimme a shirt, will ya?

16:53.387 --> 16:55.981
How do you get that thing off,
with a can opener?

16:58.476 --> 17:01.446
Hey, you guys, come
in here and look at this.

17:01.812 --> 17:02.813
Come here.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.531
Look, isn't that weird?
It's that girl.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.742
It's that girl who killed
everybody, Angela Baker.

17:14.659 --> 17:18.334
Oh, yuck.
That is so gross.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.714
I think they should have
told us about this.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.001
You think anybody
would come here if they did?

17:23.667 --> 17:25.295
Shit, you're dumber
than you look.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.008
UP yours.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.594
And how much did they
charge you to come here?

17:32.760 --> 17:34.353
Little rich girl.

17:35.012 --> 17:38.061
I don't know.
3,000 bucks, I think.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.608
God.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.527
And I bet the fucking
government paid them

17:41.686 --> 17:43.359
at least that much for us.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.943
An experiment in
sharing, my ass.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.077
We're here 'cause they
can't get anybody else.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.156
And then we've got
some crazy asshole

17:53.322 --> 17:55.916
named Angela Baker
to thank for it.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.834
- Just sign here, please.
- Okay.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.215
And that.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.764
Hold it.
I need to see some ID.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.701
No offense, but it looks like
you've been through a lot

18:34.864 --> 18:36.036
in 17 years.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.366
I have.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.548
Well, I hope you have a
nice time here, Maria.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.458
Thank you.

18:48.836 --> 18:49.928
Welcome.

18:54.342 --> 18:57.095
Alright, everybody,
now pay attention.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.513
Pay attention.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.681
When you hear
your name called,

19:00.848 --> 19:03.442
I want you to then stand
next to your counselor.

19:03.726 --> 19:07.606
Okay, my group is A-Rad,
Bobby, Riff, and Cindy.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.069
Let's meet over here.

19:10.608 --> 19:15.660
And Herman's group is Peter,
Jan, Maria and Snowboy.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.281
Right over here.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.206
- Maria? Are you Maria?
- Oh.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.664
Alright.
Barney's group is Marsha,

19:24.830 --> 19:27.629
Tony, Anita and Greg.
Right over there.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.711
Alright, everybody.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.879
I know that in the
next three days

19:32.046 --> 19:33.764
we'll get to know each
other much better.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.470
When we all get
together again,

19:35.633 --> 19:38.136
I promise it
won't be the same.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.430
- Let's go.
- There's spray paint on my map.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.853
- He spray painted your map?
- Yes.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.644
Well, at least he didn't
graffiti the tree, dear.

19:46.811 --> 19:49.189
Okay? Let's go.
Come on!

19:55.319 --> 19:57.037
Come on, come on.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.051
We're here.

20:11.293 --> 20:14.388
Home sweet home.
Just put everything down...

20:15.506 --> 20:16.507
and rest.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.551
God, we finally made it.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.935
Oh, it's not that bad.

20:20.094 --> 20:22.142
Back home we've got
hills like this all over.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.727
So do we, the Hollywood Hills.
Right, Tony?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.101
I guess.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.894
Who's hungry?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.529
- I am. I am
- I am.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.690
Good, let's cook something
before we set up camp.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.240
I know we're supposed to
<i>catch</i> fish, and we will.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.782
Maybe tomorrow.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.831
But I thought you guys would
like a little something special.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.661
I know I'm bending the
rules a little bit, but...

20:45.411 --> 20:48.210
- Whoa, hey!
- Hey, wieners!

20:48.414 --> 20:51.008
You can break the rules.
You're a cop.

20:54.545 --> 20:55.762
Look.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.847
I'm doing it now because

20:58.007 --> 21:00.510
when I had a chance to
do it with my own son, I didn't.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.602
How old is he?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.564
My son would
have been 18.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.559
He was murdered
here last year.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.527
God, I'm sorry.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.396
You didn't know.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.149
Hey, look, uh...

21:17.067 --> 21:18.819
I'm sorry for giving
you a hard time.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.537
It's alright.
I'm used to it.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.751
I'm a cop, remember?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.038
Yeah.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.637
Where'd you learn
to chop wood like that?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.052
I've never chopped
it before,

21:42.218 --> 21:43.515
but I've chopped
other things.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.525
Let me know when you
want these sticks, Mr. Miranda.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.560
Any time now, sweet pea.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.441
And call me Herman.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.236
- Where's Snowboy?
- I don't know.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.238
Snowboy!

21:59.485 --> 22:01.579
Yeah, what?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.994
Time to go fishing.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.751
What a dildo.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.541
- Do we have to?
- We gotta eat, don't we?

22:13.958 --> 22:15.335
I hate fish.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.005
That's no way to talk,
sweet pea.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.759
You guys go get a couple
poles and some bait

22:23.926 --> 22:26.349
and I'll meet you down
by the lake in a few minutes.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.434
Okay.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.897
Sweet pea.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.564
Come on out,
sweet pea.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.242
Daddy won't make
you go fishing

22:40.401 --> 22:42.278
if you don't want to,
sweet pea.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.705
Hey, you know,
this is kind of fun.

22:49.869 --> 22:50.711
Yeah.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.622
Kind of stupid,
if you ask me.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.131
I think I caught something.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.378
- Oh.
- Where'd that thing come from?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.262
Storm must have
washed it up.

23:01.505 --> 23:05.430
- Lot of trash in this lake.
- What day is it, anyway?

23:06.343 --> 23:09.062
- It's Saturday.
- Yeah, the 14th.

23:10.347 --> 23:12.441
Here.
I'll do it.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.274
You get used to it
after a while.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.535
- It's kind of fun.
- Trip out!

23:27.489 --> 23:28.832
Herman should
be here by now.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.413
I wonder what's
taking him so long.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.750
He's trying to get into
that rich skank's pants.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.918
That's disgusting.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.085
I wouldn't mind having
a piece of her myself.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.047
No!

23:49.386 --> 23:51.309
Come here, dude,
let me try.

23:51.472 --> 23:52.815
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.574
- We've got company.
- Oh, shit.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.034
Maria.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.835
Maria,
give me a chance!

25:36.994 --> 25:38.086
My old lady don't
give me no more

25:38.245 --> 25:39.246
of nothing no more.

25:47.504 --> 25:48.756
Herman!

25:50.174 --> 25:52.677
Herman, come back in here.
What are you doing?

26:18.744 --> 26:20.462
Good thing you're dead,
because in a couple years

26:20.621 --> 26:22.749
your breasts would have been
sagging something terrible.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.193
Hey, when are Herman
and Janet coming back?

26:47.481 --> 26:48.949
Not for a long time.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.114
But before he left he said
we should go to be early.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.778
We've got a
big day tomorrow.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.500
- You brat.
- Screw off.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.750
Snowboy, would you
help me with the fish?

27:02.913 --> 27:05.166
- I'm busy.
- Doing what?

27:05.332 --> 27:06.879
I'm making art.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.343
Trip out on this.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.434
That's my tent.

27:16.802 --> 27:17.894
Bombs away!

27:20.973 --> 27:21.974
I warned you.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.608
Party all night!
Teenage wasteland!

27:29.731 --> 27:32.530
Why did I think this year
would be any different?

27:40.117 --> 27:42.745
That was the best burger
I have ever eaten.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.003
- Sounds like it.
- Mine, too.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.086
- Thanks for cooking, Tony.
- Yeah, thanks Tony.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.295
No problem.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.632
Well, I've got to
go to the latrine.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.671
Nothing against your
burgers, Tony.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.675
Tony, why don't
you go with her?

27:56.842 --> 27:58.560
- No, I'll be alright.
- Maybe so.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.346
But I don't want
you going by yourself.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.604
Go ahead.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.732
Fine.
God.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.775
Tony's escort service.

28:12.274 --> 28:14.322
Can you believe that
about Barney's son?

28:14.484 --> 28:16.361
- God, I know.
- God.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.155
If I had known all that
had happened,

28:18.322 --> 28:20.074
I would never
have come here.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.076
- Would you have?
- No way.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.287
This place gives
me the creeps.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.454
Yeah.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.331
But I'm glad to
be out of L.A.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.555
Hey, did you hear that?

28:35.464 --> 28:37.637
- What?
- Something in the woods.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.471
No.
Now come on.

28:48.685 --> 28:49.652
Give me the flashlight.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.651
Hey, who the hell's out there?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.190
Who is it?

28:54.650 --> 28:56.118
Who is it?
What do you want?

29:16.630 --> 29:18.177
Stop it.

30:43.050 --> 30:44.051
Batter up.

32:21.440 --> 32:22.987
I'm not very active
in the morning

32:23.150 --> 32:24.367
until I've had my coffee.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.198
Is it almost done?

32:38.582 --> 32:40.084
Riff. Riff.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.299
Riff, please turn
the music down.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.212
You scared the
shit out of me.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.499
Sorry.
It's an old habit.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.931
What are you
doing here?

33:32.093 --> 33:34.187
I'm supposed to switch with
someone from this group.

33:34.471 --> 33:35.768
Herman said so.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.059
He wasn't supposed to...

33:38.225 --> 33:40.148
He's always screwing up.

33:43.438 --> 33:44.610
So who's like, the shithead

33:44.773 --> 33:46.025
you're supposed
to switch with?

33:47.692 --> 33:48.818
You.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.501
That's fucking great.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.343
Hey, how old
are you, anyway?

34:05.919 --> 34:09.514
- Seventeen.
- Oh. You look older.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.507
I know.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.101
When I was young,
our town's water supply

34:14.261 --> 34:15.638
didn't have any fluoride.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.858
Hey, how come there's
only two tents?

34:24.187 --> 34:25.688
The other one
got sort of wrecked.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.449
It was pretty wild
here last night.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.452
- Alright.
- That tent's yours.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.489
I think Peter and Snowboy
are in there right now.

34:35.447 --> 34:36.870
Anybody home?

34:39.494 --> 34:41.087
There's no one in here.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.250
You bitch!
That hurt.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.885
Don't you ever...

34:50.672 --> 34:54.427
You're a Gemini,
and a Cancer...

34:55.260 --> 34:57.683
Aries.
I'm a Libra.

34:58.388 --> 35:01.562
Now that we know each
other's signs... Maria!

35:02.392 --> 35:03.393
Come join us.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.900
I call this our
sharing and caring time.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.695
For instance,
what's your favorite movie?

35:14.154 --> 35:16.452
- E.T.
- That's nice.

35:16.615 --> 35:17.992
Bobby, what's yours?

35:19.784 --> 35:22.287
I like movies that make
America look great.

35:22.704 --> 35:23.626
Like...

35:23.788 --> 35:26.257
Like Rambo Part 3.
Great film.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.585
Cindy, what's your
favorite movie?

35:28.752 --> 35:30.095
Oh, I don't know.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.880
Ones with really
good acting,

35:32.047 --> 35:34.641
like Gone with the Wind,
or The Carebears.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.181
How about it, Riff?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.936
Ones with tits and blood.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.441
Well...

35:44.976 --> 35:46.569
What I want
to know is why

35:46.728 --> 35:49.026
we have to keep listening
to these stupid rap tapes.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.445
I mean, who likes
that stuff anymore?

35:51.608 --> 35:53.360
- Fuck you.
- Riff, now--

35:53.526 --> 35:54.652
I mean, rap is a hell
of a lot better

35:54.819 --> 35:56.913
than that country shit.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.915
I never said
I liked country.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.918
I'd rather see that than a bunch
of darkies who can't sing.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.920
- Bitch.
- Riff.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.081
You dirty nigger.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.793
Riff, stop it!
Stop it right now!

36:09.959 --> 36:14.089
Stop it right now or I will
call Officer Whitmore.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.383
Shame on you, Cindy.

36:20.095 --> 36:24.225
So... Maria.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.478
What's your favorite color?

36:29.229 --> 36:31.197
- Blood-red.
- Hey, me too.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.861
- Really?
- Yeah!

36:33.108 --> 36:37.158
Oh, sharing.
That's nice.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.248
He scared that raccoon
half to death.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.955
It was so funny.
Come on, Tony.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.870
Scream again,
we want to hear it, come on.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.004
This white girl keeps
giving me a hard time.

36:47.163 --> 36:50.542
- You poor baby.
- I hate to ask this,

36:50.709 --> 36:52.928
but whatever happened
to Angela Baker?

36:53.420 --> 36:54.467
Nobody knows.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.049
There've been no pictures of
her since seven years ago.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.968
Plus, when she was 18 her
juvenile records were destroyed.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.312
So all we have to go
on are descriptions.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.015
But she was a counselor
here last year.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.182
Didn't anyone take
a picture with her?

37:06.349 --> 37:08.568
Nope.
She wasn't very popular.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.320
Supposedly
nobody wanted to.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.488
Well, what did she look like?

37:13.481 --> 37:14.698
She's white.

37:15.567 --> 37:20.744
5 foot 5, 115 pounds,
brown eyes, reddish-brown hair.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.790
She's 21 years old.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.744
And what would you do
if you ever met her?

37:27.954 --> 37:29.046
I'd kill her.

37:33.126 --> 37:36.130
Alright, you sharers.
Come gather 'round.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.348
Alright, everyone.

37:39.507 --> 37:43.762
It's time to put our
differences aside, Cindy,

37:44.137 --> 37:47.311
and try to move on.
Atta girl.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.902
We're going to do
a trust game right now.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.812
Let's break up into pairs.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.985
Let's break up
into pairs, Bobby.

38:00.904 --> 38:01.951
Looks like you and
me are partners-

38:02.113 --> 38:04.616
- Shut up!
- Cool, man. Right on.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.874
One of you will be
blindfolded with

38:08.077 --> 38:09.499
your hands tied
behind your back.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.290
Your partners will then
lead you around

38:12.457 --> 38:15.381
and after 15 minutes
or so you'll switch.

38:15.543 --> 38:19.593
Oh, this'll be fun.
You can go first.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.099
- Good work.
- Ow.

38:25.261 --> 38:28.561
Oh, did I hurt you?
I'm sorry.

38:33.561 --> 38:34.608
How you doing, honey?

38:34.771 --> 38:36.364
- Okay.
- Good.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.070
I wish I could
say the same.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.906
That nigger could
have killed me.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.904
I bet he would
have liked that, too.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.577
He could brag to
all his homeboys

38:45.740 --> 38:48.584
how he massacred
some rich white girl.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.662
Those street gangs
do that, you know.

38:52.413 --> 38:55.383
- Would you watch out?
- Sorry.

38:58.211 --> 39:00.839
Be a good girl and stay
right there just a second.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.758
- Hey!
- Gotta have my ciggy-

39:35.164 --> 39:36.757
There's something
crawling on me!

39:37.041 --> 39:39.590
- I don't see anything.
- Get this blindfold off.

39:41.004 --> 39:42.301
What did you put on me?

39:42.463 --> 39:44.056
Honey, it was nothing.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.135
Your turn.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.310
You don't have to get
so screwed up about it.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.352
You city kids have just got
to get used to the country.

40:01.858 --> 40:03.235
- Too tight?
- Yeah.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.453
- Where are we?
- It's a surprise.

40:13.620 --> 40:16.590
Well, I'm getting tired
and my feet hurt.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.672
I thought you country girls
were used to this kind of stuff.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.674
- Ha ha.
- Are you a cheerleader?

40:22.837 --> 40:23.838
Yes.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.262
- Are you a virgin?
- No!

40:27.425 --> 40:30.429
- Do you take drugs?
- Doesn't everybody?

40:31.346 --> 40:33.895
- Strike three.
- It's about time we stopped.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.643
Take this stuff
off me right now.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.399
Did you hear me?

40:40.438 --> 40:43.487
Oh, I get it.
You're leaving me now.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.324
Oh, help!
Something's crawling on me.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.075
Hey!

40:52.951 --> 40:54.703
What...
What are you doing?!

40:56.788 --> 40:58.165
God!

41:00.917 --> 41:02.760
Oh, is this some
kind of joke?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.679
Oh, you think
this is funny?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.012
You don't know who
you're messing with.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.517
Do you know who my dad is?

41:11.344 --> 41:13.096
What's going on?

41:13.721 --> 41:15.519
Let me down!

41:16.432 --> 41:17.558
Stop it!

41:18.226 --> 41:20.194
I'll sue you for
everything you've got!

41:21.479 --> 41:22.776
Stop it!

41:23.564 --> 41:25.362
Why are you
doing this to me?!

41:25.525 --> 41:30.452
Because you're a cheerleader,
a fornicator, a drug taker,

41:30.613 --> 41:34.663
a nasty, snotty bigot,
and besides that,

41:34.826 --> 41:36.203
you're real nice.

41:56.764 --> 41:59.313
- Where's Cindy?
- She's at the main camp.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.943
She's got a headache.

42:01.936 --> 42:04.189
Oh, be a dear
and go get her.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.985
And while you're at it,
grab that garbage bag

42:08.151 --> 42:13.829
next to my tent and put it in
the dump behind the dining hall.

42:18.828 --> 42:21.547
Oh, and I'm almost
out of bug spray.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.050
There's some in the
pantry next to the kitchen.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.419
The door should be open.

42:26.586 --> 42:28.930
Take the trail by
the old outhouse.

42:30.590 --> 42:35.892
- Isn't there a cabin up there?
- Yeah, it was torn down.

42:41.768 --> 42:44.521
Is that where they found all
those dead bodies last year?

42:46.355 --> 42:47.607
How'd you know about that?

42:48.858 --> 42:50.280
I guess I read about it.

42:51.778 --> 42:53.576
Don't tell the others.
It'll spook 'em.

42:56.532 --> 42:58.375
Hurry back.
It's almost time for lunch.

45:09.457 --> 45:14.054
- Good morning, campers.
- Good morning, Angela.

45:26.515 --> 45:29.189
Isn't it a wonderful
day to be alive?

45:29.352 --> 45:31.104
Yes!

45:38.903 --> 45:45.331
Oh, I'm a happy camper.
I love the summer sun.

45:45.493 --> 45:50.465
I love the trees and forests.
I'm always having fun.

45:50.623 --> 45:58.599
Oh, I'm a happy camper.
I love the clear blue sky.

45:58.756 --> 46:05.105
And with the grace of God,
I'll camp until I die.

46:07.723 --> 46:10.647
Thank you!
Thank you!

46:15.314 --> 46:17.316
As some of you may know...

46:17.984 --> 46:20.362
I've had a lot of
hard times in my life.

46:21.487 --> 46:27.711
I've been abused, picked on,
and misunderstood

46:27.868 --> 46:29.461
as long as I
can remember.

46:31.163 --> 46:34.588
But that's why places
like this are so great.

46:34.750 --> 46:37.970
We can go to camp and
learn to love each other.

46:39.714 --> 46:42.513
Thanks for being
such good kids.

46:44.010 --> 46:46.980
You've made this camp
a lot of fun.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.728
I love you all.

46:53.728 --> 46:57.699
You like me.
You really, really like me!

48:13.724 --> 48:15.397
Thanks, dear.
ls Cindy coming?

48:15.559 --> 48:17.937
No. She's resting in
one of the cabins.

48:18.979 --> 48:20.447
She's not supposed
to do that.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.692
Oh, well.
What can I do?

48:24.276 --> 48:27.530
Well, are you ready
for another trust game?

48:28.781 --> 48:30.704
I thought it was
time to eat.

48:31.242 --> 48:34.462
Well, it's almost time.
Bobby, come over here, dear.

48:37.039 --> 48:39.007
I want you two
to stand together.

48:39.792 --> 48:41.214
Come on,
side by side.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.764
And I'm going to
tie you together.

48:46.215 --> 48:49.890
Now, you're going to have
to coordinate your walking,

48:50.386 --> 48:52.480
and your hand movements,
everything.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.356
On, Riff.

48:54.515 --> 48:55.767
Since Cindy's
not feeling well,

48:55.933 --> 48:57.651
looks like you and I
are gonna be partners.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.812
No fucking way.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.526
How long do we
have to do this for?

49:02.189 --> 49:05.033
Well, until you catch enough
fish for lunch and dinner.

49:05.359 --> 49:07.202
It'll test how well
you work together.

49:07.778 --> 49:09.872
What about the
steak you were cooking?

49:10.030 --> 49:13.455
That was mine.
I'm allergic to fish.

49:29.133 --> 49:30.259
Here, give me the hook.

49:34.263 --> 49:35.264
There.

49:35.723 --> 49:36.690
Wow, you're good at that.

49:36.849 --> 49:38.351
Yeah, that's what
everybody says.

49:38.517 --> 49:39.734
Now cast.

49:49.695 --> 49:51.288
So Why'd you
come here, anyway?

49:51.906 --> 49:53.749
Well, it's a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

49:54.366 --> 49:56.039
Plus it'll look great
on my resume.

50:01.290 --> 50:02.462
Will you hold this for a minute?

50:02.666 --> 50:03.883
Sure.

50:06.504 --> 50:07.926
Can I tell you something?

50:08.547 --> 50:09.594
What?

50:11.050 --> 50:12.302
I think you're nice.

50:13.344 --> 50:14.470
Thanks.

50:17.056 --> 50:18.353
Do you think I'm nice?

50:19.141 --> 50:21.564
Yeah, I guess.

50:22.686 --> 50:23.653
Good.

50:26.899 --> 50:28.446
Can I tell you
something else?

50:29.026 --> 50:30.198
What?

50:31.487 --> 50:32.830
I like being tied up.

50:33.364 --> 50:36.208
Especially next to you.
It turns me on.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.333
Stop it!

50:41.455 --> 50:43.378
- I thought you wanted it!
- No!

50:43.541 --> 50:45.043
Your type always does.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.261
At least not now.

50:50.381 --> 50:52.304
Meet me at the main camp
right after dark.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.269
How will we
get away from Lilly?

50:55.427 --> 50:58.021
Don't worry.
I'll handle it.

51:02.268 --> 51:03.440
Oh, excuse me.

51:16.991 --> 51:18.208
Just keep it down.

51:30.296 --> 51:33.175
Good job, but why don't
you put them down?

51:35.259 --> 51:38.934
Riff?
Marie and Bobby caught the fish.

51:39.388 --> 51:40.560
I think you should clean them.

51:40.723 --> 51:42.646
Oh, fuck that shit.

51:43.350 --> 51:45.068
Bobby, maybe
you should clean them.

51:45.728 --> 51:47.901
But that's not fair.
He never does anything.

51:48.063 --> 51:49.360
I'll handle it!

51:51.525 --> 51:52.526
HI!

51:53.444 --> 51:56.368
Look, we just spent
two hours catching fish.

51:56.530 --> 51:58.077
I think it's only fair
that you clean them.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.999
Can you please turn that down?

52:03.996 --> 52:04.997
What?

52:05.331 --> 52:07.550
I said turn down the music!

52:09.084 --> 52:10.461
What?

52:10.836 --> 52:12.884
You heard me
the first time!

52:17.509 --> 52:18.556
What?

52:22.431 --> 52:24.058
Bobby, clean the fish.

52:29.521 --> 52:31.489
This is pretty easy.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.777
- Oh, yeah?
- Make it harder.

52:33.942 --> 52:36.036
- Hey, how's that?
- Alright, alright, stop it!

52:36.195 --> 52:38.163
Stop it, I'm getting dizzy.
God.

52:38.322 --> 52:39.619
Ouch.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.079
Get this off me.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.997
Alright, it's gonna
be your turn now.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.749
- Nuh-uh.
- Mm-hm.

52:49.124 --> 52:52.128
- I'll tell. I'll do it.
- Oh, jeez. I'm scared.

52:53.879 --> 52:55.631
Hey, so what's it like
where you live, huh?

52:56.382 --> 52:58.851
- Where I live it's kind of-
- Oh, no, don't tell me.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.474
You go to a little
red brick school

53:01.637 --> 53:03.310
and you're in the choir.

53:03.472 --> 53:05.349
It's orange brick and
I'm in the band.

53:05.516 --> 53:08.645
Same difference.
You got really nice parents,

53:08.811 --> 53:11.655
and your town has a park
where every 4th of July

53:11.814 --> 53:14.283
there's fireworks,
plus at Christmas

53:14.441 --> 53:17.115
there's a big parade
when Santa Claus arrives.

53:17.277 --> 53:19.450
- Yes! Yes.
- Am I right?

53:19.613 --> 53:21.411
You don't have to make
fun of me, you know.

53:22.449 --> 53:24.747
And what have you been doing
to me this whole weekend?

53:27.121 --> 53:29.795
Tony, are you in a gang?

53:30.874 --> 53:33.093
- Yeah.
- Really?

53:33.794 --> 53:35.387
Where I come from
everybody is.

53:36.380 --> 53:39.224
God.
Well, what is that like?

53:39.717 --> 53:43.017
Oh, you know!
Baggy pants, man!

53:43.554 --> 53:46.182
The low riders!
The bandanas.

53:46.348 --> 53:47.474
All that gang shit.

53:48.726 --> 53:50.148
I wish I could get out.

53:51.645 --> 53:52.646
Why don't you?

53:53.772 --> 53:56.571
Because the only way
to do that is to move.

53:57.276 --> 54:00.450
- Well, you could move.
- Yeah, I could.

54:01.613 --> 54:03.615
Maybe I'll come live
with you in Idaho.

54:03.782 --> 54:06.535
- It's Ohio. Same difference.
- Same difference.

54:10.581 --> 54:12.458
Are you scared of me?

54:13.959 --> 54:18.009
No. Well...
I was, kind of.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.509
You're very pretty.

54:23.135 --> 54:24.432
Thanks.

54:26.388 --> 54:27.514
Can I kiss you?

54:51.914 --> 54:54.087
- Wait.
- What's wrong?

54:54.249 --> 54:57.298
Nothing. Just,
if we're gonna make love...

54:58.003 --> 55:00.005
You have to wear
one of these.

55:01.882 --> 55:03.850
- Okay?
- I'm moving to Ohio.

55:15.729 --> 55:16.730
Lilly.

55:17.773 --> 55:19.650
Let's play the blindfold
game together.

55:19.817 --> 55:20.943
Oh, no, I don't think so.

55:21.109 --> 55:22.736
Please?
I'll lead you back to camp.

55:22.903 --> 55:24.325
That was you can
check up on Cindy.

55:25.572 --> 55:28.291
Why not? I was beginning
to worry about her anyway.

55:28.575 --> 55:29.747
I'll get two strips of cloth.

55:29.910 --> 55:30.957
I got some.

55:32.913 --> 55:33.914
I'll do you.

55:40.420 --> 55:41.842
So are you planning
a trip soon?

55:42.422 --> 55:45.096
Yes, Herman and I
are going to Europe.

55:45.551 --> 55:49.351
It'll be very expensive,
but like Herman says,

55:49.513 --> 55:50.856
we're worth it.

55:51.765 --> 55:53.733
You know, I saw
cockroaches in the pantry.

55:53.892 --> 55:55.439
And I think I saw a mouse.

55:55.602 --> 55:56.774
Really?

55:56.937 --> 55:58.655
We've got to do
something about that.

55:58.814 --> 55:59.656
Yeah.

55:59.815 --> 56:01.283
Why do you
bury your trash?

56:01.567 --> 56:05.071
Uh, garbage companies
cost an arm and a leg.

56:07.239 --> 56:08.707
They're not that expensive.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.704
Every penny counts,
let me tell you.

56:12.911 --> 56:15.664
It hasn't been easy
taking over this place.

56:15.998 --> 56:18.797
Nobody wants to go
to a camp where

56:18.959 --> 56:21.087
everyone's been slaughtered.

56:26.508 --> 56:28.101
So, have you ordered
your tickets yet?

56:28.343 --> 56:29.390
No.

56:33.640 --> 56:37.065
Good, because your
trip's been cancelled.

56:39.688 --> 56:41.611
Let me out of here!

56:41.773 --> 56:43.275
Get me out of here!

56:44.484 --> 56:48.830
What are you doing?!
Stop, get me out of here!

56:48.989 --> 56:52.209
There's rats in here!
They'll eat me alive!

56:52.367 --> 56:54.586
Don't worry.
They'll be suffocated soon.

56:54.870 --> 56:58.750
What are you doing?
Get me out of here!

56:59.291 --> 57:03.762
Oh, I'm a happy camper.
I love the summer sun.

57:04.046 --> 57:08.552
I love the trees and forests.
I'm always having fun.

57:09.134 --> 57:15.187
Oh, I'm a happy camper.
I love the clear blue sky.

57:15.849 --> 57:20.150
And with the grace of God,
I'll camp until I die.

57:20.312 --> 57:22.406
Help me!

57:23.899 --> 57:27.449
I changed my mind about Europe.
You can go with us!

57:39.706 --> 57:40.798
<i>By the way“-</i>

57:41.959 --> 57:43.632
Your husband fools around.

57:46.213 --> 57:49.558
You can't leave me.
You can't leave me.

57:50.008 --> 57:53.012
Come back!
Come back!

57:53.178 --> 57:55.931
Oh, no.
You're in big trouble.

57:56.098 --> 57:59.728
You little shit,
get back here right now!

58:00.185 --> 58:02.404
Come back here,
did you hear me?!

58:02.562 --> 58:06.112
Come back and
dig me out of here!

58:08.652 --> 58:11.451
No, no!
Not the lawnmower!

58:11.822 --> 58:13.824
No
No

58:33.802 --> 58:34.894
Guess who?

58:35.178 --> 58:37.226
- Bobby?
- Yeah.

58:37.472 --> 58:39.895
- How'd you know?
- Lucky guess.

58:41.476 --> 58:42.728
Stand against the tree.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.107
So you like to
be tied up, huh?

58:48.066 --> 58:50.535
Yeah, but don't tell
anyone, okay?

58:50.694 --> 58:51.741
If the wrong person found out

58:51.945 --> 58:53.197
I could lose an
election someday.

58:53.989 --> 58:55.787
My lips are sealed.

58:57.492 --> 58:58.914
Put your hands
behind the tree.

59:00.162 --> 59:01.880
Aren't you going to
take my clothes off first?

59:02.122 --> 59:04.170
No, it's much more
fun like this.

59:04.750 --> 59:05.797
Oh.

59:08.462 --> 59:09.679
Wow.

59:10.422 --> 59:13.346
This is like something in one of
those dirty magazines, you know?

59:14.384 --> 59:15.886
Bondage Camp.

59:16.970 --> 59:18.187
Oh, wouldn't that be cool?

59:18.764 --> 59:20.232
Reading about this?

59:20.390 --> 59:22.563
I think it's much
more fun to live it.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.019
Yeah.

59:27.814 --> 59:29.157
I really appreciate this.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.034
You know,
I don't want you to think

59:31.234 --> 59:32.611
that I don't respect
you or anything

59:32.778 --> 59:33.700
because I really do.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.118
I think you're really
a neat person.

59:38.575 --> 59:42.205
So...
When do we screw?

59:45.874 --> 59:47.126
Hey, what are you doing?

59:49.294 --> 59:52.844
Thank God there'll be
one less idiot in politics.

59:54.382 --> 59:55.929
Hey: What are you doing?!

59:57.719 --> 59:58.971
Don't!

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:02.974
Get back here!

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.220
Yes, sir.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:57.158
Angels are pretty,
angels can fly,

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.322
and here is an angel
that can make you die.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:04.211
You got no style, got no flair,
all you do is fight and swear,

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:06.918
so say your prayers
and make amends,

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.708
'cause your life story
is about to end.

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.261
What the fuck?

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:15.471
Hey!

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.137
Hey, what the fuck?
You fuckhead!

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.267
I'll get you!

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.477
OW! Ow!
Hey! Ow!

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:55.178
There's Maria.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.006
Hello.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:11.561
Hi.
What can we do for you?

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.571
Herman wants me
in this group.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:15.115
I'm supposed to switch.

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:17.692
With Marsha.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:20.278
- Oh, man.
- Oh my God.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.006
I mean,
our group was so good!

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:34.213
Maybe if I talk with Herman
he'll let you stay.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:37.254
But it's not my camp so we're
gonna have to do what he wants.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.594
Besides, we're all getting
together tomorrow anyway.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.384
I know, but it was tonight
that was so special.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.723
With us?
Or with Tony?

01:02:44.886 --> 01:02:47.264
Maria, look out!
God.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.556
Are you alright?

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:52.440
- It hurts.
- What are we gonna do?

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:53.569
Got to cut it off.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.571
- No!
- I'm just joking.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:56.697
Come on, now lighten up.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:00.076
Let's get you up.
Let's take it easy.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.332
We're lucky we have this.

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:09.710
Our first aid kit is
pretty empty.

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.166
What a surprise.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.501
Well, it doesn't look that bad.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:20.008
But you're going to need to stay
off of it as much as possible.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.224
Is it gonna make it feel better?

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:24.426
Yeah.

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:27.349
Thanks.
I mean it.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.274
As soon as I get
this thing bandaged,

01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:32.685
I'm gonna have to
go get Herman.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.186
How well do you know him?

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:37.738
Not very well.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.197
Good, because he's
a terrible counselor

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.703
- and so is Lilly.
- Oh, they're not that bad.

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:47.240
They eat steak
while we eat fish.

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:49.413
He fornicates with
the campers.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:50.668
He does?

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:53.000
And she's so lazy,
she doesn't do anything

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:54.506
but sit around all day.

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.295
And how do you
know all this?

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:57.801
I have eyes.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.723
Did Herman really tell you
to come switch with Marsha?

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:05.804
Or did you just
make all that up?

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:09.888
I made it up.
I want to be with you guys.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:11.894
Sorry, Maria.

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:14.226
You got to
stick to the rules.

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:16.231
And you're going to have
to go back to Herman.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:17.771
Oh, Barney,
she can come with us.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:19.939
- Please?
- It's just for one more day.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:21.654
Sorry.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.027
We'll help you walk
back to the camp.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.992
- Sorry.
- You do it.

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:34.204
Does Lilly really just
sit around all day?

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:36.544
Yeah. In fact,
she's out there right now.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.299
- Go see for yourself.
- Really?

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:39.709
Can I, Barney?

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:42.463
Sure. Just don't
laugh in her face, okay?

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:43.630
I won't.

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:45.925
I'm warning you,
it's not a pretty sight.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:48.093
- Alright, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.103
How's that feel?

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:05.781
Wait.

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:12.625
What's wrong?

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:18.965
Oh my God.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:21.718
Oh, God.

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:23.594
Seems like every
time I go to camp,

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.300
somebody
loses their head.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.183
What?

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:32.266
You remind me of
this girl I used to know.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:34.810
Her name was Molly.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.563
- What?
- She was really nice.

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:42.197
Marsha, get out of here!
Run to the highway!

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:45.108
No!
Sta“

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.496
Marsha, get out of here!

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:06.637
Marsha, get out of here!

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:21.019
You look just like your son
when you get mad.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.868
How many have you
killed this time?

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.121
I don't know.
Lots.

01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.868
But I had no choice.
They deserved it.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.415
You going to kill me, too?

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:46.802
Well, how are you
going to do it?

01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:50.507
Knife?
Drill?

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.385
How about a chainsaw?

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:56.433
Fire?

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:58.689
Battery acid?

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.815
Or are you just going to
cut my head off

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:04.103
like you did my son's?

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.122
Come on, Angela.

01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:20.874
What's it gonna be?

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:24.378
A gun.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:16.801
Oh my God!

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:26.777
No!

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:39.536
Don't make me hurt you.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:46.421
We're going to have so
much fun together, just great.

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:01.555
I think we should
go look for them.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.106
Me too.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.108
Barney told us to wait.

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:08.194
Maybe it's
some kind of test.

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:09.946
It was hours ago, man.

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:14.032
Hello.

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:19.497
Barney wants to see us
all at the main camp.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.157
Marsha's there, too.

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:23.622
We're gonna play some kind
of a trust game or something.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.161
Where've you guys been?

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:28.381
Oh, it's a long story.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.928
Hey, how come you don't
have to be tied up?

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:39.676
Because Barney said so.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.310
Hey, when's he getting here?

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:43.015
I told you, any time now.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.773
- You know, this is bullshit.
- Don't swear.

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.060
- It'll be fun.
- Says your mama.

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:51.442
Okay.
All set.

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:55.529
Oh, there's Barney!

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:56.784
Where?

01:09:57.902 --> 01:09:59.904
Oh, never mind.
I thought I saw him.

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:01.914
Is that him?

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.371
Nope.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.244
Mind's playing tricks
on me, I guess.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.292
Oh, there he is.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.430
Barney.
Thanks for dropping in.

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:21.263
Okay, time to play.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.979
Now, the object of the
game is to stay alive.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.019
The rules are simple.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:30.067
Marsha is in one of the
three cabins behind me.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:34.573
Is she in cabin number one,
cabin number two,

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.654
or cabin number three?

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:40.236
You have exactly
two minutes to find out.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.206
If you run away,
I'll kill you.

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:46.868
If you don't find her,
I'll kill you.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:51.548
And if you hurt me in
any way, I will kill you.

01:10:52.331 --> 01:10:55.335
Any questions?
Good.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:11:00.094
On your marks,
get set, go!

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:03.801
Do you think I'm joking?

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:10.732
I'm dead serious.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.524
And you just lost 15 seconds.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:15.688
Look, she'll kill us.
Let's go!

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:27.868
Marsha!

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:45.055
Minute and a half to go.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.018
Marsha!

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.643
- I can't take this anymore!
- No!

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:00.400
- Move along, move along!
- No!

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.827
Two down and one to go!

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.114
40 seconds left.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:11.794
Marsha!

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:25.887
Congratulations!

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.428
You made it,
with 7 seconds left.

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:31.893
You guys are nice kids.

01:12:32.723 --> 01:12:35.192
If you ask me these other
two were kind of boring.

01:12:37.144 --> 01:12:39.021
Well, I've got to be going.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.690
All the phone lines
have been cut,

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.905
but there's a pay phone about
three miles up the road,

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:43.989
at a little store.

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:49.907
I have to admit,
I kind of had a crush on you.

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:53.415
But you and Marsha
make a nice couple.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.126
And as my aunt always says,

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.877
there's plenty of
fish in the sea.

01:12:58.249 --> 01:12:59.466
Bye.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.307
Marsha, stop it!

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.305
Stop it.
Stop it!

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:55.731
It's okay.
We're gonna call the police.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.354
We've gotta call the police.
Come on.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.323
You try to be nice
to somebody and...

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.613
Look what happens.

01:14:27.046 --> 01:14:28.013
You okay?

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.265
You sure?

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:32.559
Yeah.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.556
I love you so much, babe.

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:40.226
I think everything's
going to be okay.

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:43.063
I'll move to Ohio.

01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:45.906
We can be
together forever.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.401
- Get married...
- Tony.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:50.577
What?

01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:54.373
I kind of already
have a boyfriend.

01:14:57.868 --> 01:14:59.495
You could come visit me.

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:04.175
Yeah, I could do that.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.018
She's still alive.

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:20.857
She doesn't
deserve to live.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.272
What do you mean?

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:24.563
Let's kill her.
Nobody'll know.

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:26.647
I don't know.

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:29.158
Come on!
She's a fucking maniac.

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:33.445
It wouldn't be hard to do.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:35.614
It'll put an end it it
once and for all.

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:40.123
- Alright. Where are we?
- I'll check.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.264
Jesus Christ!
God!

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.474
Hey!
What's going on back there?

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:04.644
Just taking care
of business.
