 Mallory?

00:09.801 --> 00:11.177
 Hey, Jack.

00:11.302 --> 00:12.470
 I can't be with someone
who doesn't trust me.

00:12.595 --> 00:13.763
 So what?

00:13.888 --> 00:14.764
You're breaking up with me?

00:14.889 --> 00:17.225
 Yeah, I think I am.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.060
MITCH: Lou, I made a decision.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.562
I decided to stay.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.440
 Does this mean what
I think it means?

00:23.565 --> 00:24.983
Because I don't
want to rush you.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.985
And I know that--

00:27.110 --> 00:30.989
JACK: So how long are you
planning on sticking around?

00:31.114 --> 00:34.993
 Trying to get rid
of me already, Jack?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.536
Jake, what are you doing here?

00:42.208 --> 00:44.711
[music playing]

00:45.795 --> 00:47.380
 I don't know what to say.

00:47.505 --> 00:48.548
 You're at a loss for words.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.885
I didn't think
that was possible.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.470
 I'm so sorry, Jake.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.472
I shouldn't have left you
alone in Paris like that.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.390
 Why didn't you
return my phone calls?

00:57.515 --> 00:59.434
 I needed time to think.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.227
 Does that mean that
you made up your mind?

01:05.022 --> 01:06.066
Mallory?

01:12.947 --> 01:14.282
 Hey, Scott.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.241
 Jack.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.368
Amy.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.079
Sorry for dropping
by without calling.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.330
I got a horse in the trailer.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.040
I was hoping you'd
take a look at it.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.500
 Yeah, of course.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.918
SCOTT: I'd appreciate
your opinion too, Jack.

01:25.043 --> 01:25.835
 Yeah, sure.

01:25.960 --> 01:26.795
No problem.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.845
 Well, this here is Tab.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.972
He's supposed to be a
champion cutting horse.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.265
 Supposed to be?

01:39.391 --> 01:40.809
SCOTT: Well, he's [inaudible].

01:40.934 --> 01:43.228
They produced a lot of high
caliber cutting horses.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.312
 Good breeding.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.356
That doesn't guarantee anything.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.108
SCOTT: That's what
I told the owner.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.734
But he's convinced
something's wrong.

01:49.859 --> 01:50.819
I did some tests.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.862
But they all came back normal.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.864
I was hoping you guys
could figure this out.

01:54.989 --> 01:58.618
 OK, but what if he's just not
good at being a cutting horse?

01:58.743 --> 02:00.370
 He'll be put up for auction.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.871
My client's only
interested in winners.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.373
 Typical.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.001
SCOTT: Well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.627
Best thing to do is get Tab
here working with some cattle.

02:08.752 --> 02:11.506
We'll go from there.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.507
 Come on, boy.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.302
(SINGING) Too many
times I've been hurt.

And life's turned
into whatever now.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.100
I've spent too many nights
in the place where I didn't

02:22.225 --> 02:25.145
think I would be going back.

LOU: (MUFFLED) Georgie, hey.

02:26.771 --> 02:30.442
(SINGING) I'm finding it
hard to believe that this

02:30.567 --> 02:31.860
is getting any better now.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.153
LOU: Hey, sorry.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.195
I knocked, but
you didn't answer.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.700
Is everything OK?

02:38.825 --> 02:39.951
Are you all right?

02:40.076 --> 02:44.122
 Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

02:44.247 --> 02:46.875
 Well, I'm trying to come
up with numbers for dinner.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.335
Do you know if Adam's coming?

02:48.460 --> 02:49.794
 No.

02:49.919 --> 02:50.795
No, no.

02:50.920 --> 02:51.713
I don't think so.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.885
Is that all?

02:57.010 --> 02:57.969
 Yeah.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.722
Yeah, that's all.

03:00.847 --> 03:04.184
(SINGING) I don't want
to be the only fool.

03:04.309 --> 03:07.312
I don't want to
be the only fool.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.025
 Hey.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.818
 Hello, Lou.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.404
 I was thinking about making
a roast for dinner tonight.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.908
 Oh, that sounds nice.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.411
 I was also thinking maybe we
could invite Mitch to join us.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.496
 Mitch?

03:24.621 --> 03:25.914
 Yeah.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.624
You know, he's been working
for us for over a year

03:27.749 --> 03:30.752
and thought it was time
to invite him for dinner,

03:30.877 --> 03:31.836
don't you think?

03:31.961 --> 03:33.838
 Oh, I think
that's a fine idea.

03:33.963 --> 03:34.839
LOU: Good.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.217
MALLORY: Oh, I'm starving.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.927
I think being back
in the countryside

03:39.052 --> 03:41.221
has given me an appetite.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.224
I think it's the fresh air.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.768
Do you have any yogurt left?

03:46.893 --> 03:47.560
 We're all out.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.230
But I'll pick some up.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.190
 What's Jake
doing back in town?

03:52.315 --> 03:53.358
Is everything OK?

03:53.483 --> 03:54.984
 Everything's great.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.405
We had a serious talk, and
we decided to get married.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.281
Could you get the Greek stuff?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.658
Vanilla if they have it?

04:01.783 --> 04:04.035
If they're out, I'll
settle for coconut.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.079
 Wait, what?

04:06.204 --> 04:07.580
 I don't mind coconut.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.417
It's just that vanilla
is my favorite.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.755
That's not what you meant.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.302
Jake and I are getting married.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.893
[music - jenn grant, "dreamer"]

04:40.155 --> 04:47.704
And at the break of day,
you sank into the dream.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.041
You dreamer.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.000
You dreamer.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.504
You dreamer.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.559
 Wow, that's amazing news.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.603
Isn't that amazing
news, grandpa?

05:11.728 --> 05:14.773
JACK: It seems to be coming
right out of the blue.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.024
 Not really.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.650
Jake proposed to me
two weeks ago in Paris.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.028
But I needed some time to think.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.988
That's why I came here.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.532
But I'm glad I did
because it kind of just

05:24.657 --> 05:27.410
put everything into perspective.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.497
 OK so when's the big day?

05:30.622 --> 05:33.166
 I think we're just going to
sign some papers at town hall

05:33.291 --> 05:34.793
probably sometime tomorrow.

05:34.918 --> 05:35.919
 Tomorrow?

05:36.044 --> 05:36.795
Tomorrow?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.171
Why the big rush?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.340
 It's just easier that way.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.133
We don't want our
parents to know,

05:42.258 --> 05:44.135
at least till after it's done.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.887
 Why not?

05:46.012 --> 05:48.807
 Well, Jason and dad are in
the middle of a messy divorce.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.475
And as soon as my
parents get involved,

05:50.600 --> 05:52.394
it'll become a circus.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.855
Every B list country star
will be on the guest list.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.317
And my dad's going
to want to sing.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.527
No.

06:00.652 --> 06:04.030
 OK, I understand
that family can

06:04.155 --> 06:06.324
be a lot of hassle at times.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.452
But this is your wedding
we're talking about here.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.788
You don't want to
have any regrets.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.998
 Can you please
be happy for me?

06:14.124 --> 06:15.959
JACK: We're happy for you.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.920
 As long as this is what
you both really want.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.588
 It is.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.340
JACK: Oh, OK then.

06:22.465 --> 06:28.388
Well, if that's the case, I
guess we better have Jake over

06:28.513 --> 06:31.141
for dinner tonight, right Lou?

06:31.266 --> 06:32.642
 Tonight?

06:32.767 --> 06:33.393
Yes.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.686
Yeah, of course.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.147
We should all just
celebrate together.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.898
 You said it was going
to be a quiet dinner.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.066
 I know.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.901
But how was I supposed
to know that Jack

06:42.027 --> 06:43.445
was going to turn it into an
engagement party for Mallory

06:43.570 --> 06:45.739
and Jake?

06:45.864 --> 06:47.157
 I think we should
just stick to the plan.

06:47.282 --> 06:50.702
LOU: No, it's going to
be way too weird, Mitch.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.412
We'll just have to find
another time to tell

06:52.537 --> 06:56.082
everyone about, you know, us.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.584
 When?

06:57.709 --> 07:00.128
 I don't know, when I
come back from New York.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.881
I mean, the next time I
come back from New York.

07:03.006 --> 07:03.882
MITCH: Two weeks?

07:04.007 --> 07:07.010
Lou, we need to tell people now.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.304
Let's just tell everybody
at dinner tonight,

07:09.429 --> 07:12.265
just rip it off like a Band-Aid.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.602
 Yeah, nothing says romance
like ripping off a Band-Aid.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.854
 [laughs] You
know what I meant.

07:17.979 --> 07:18.938
 OK, fine.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.106
You're right.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.566
I don't know what
I'm so worried about.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.735
I mean, this is the
easy part, right?

Wait till we have to
tell my dad when he

07:25.070 --> 07:26.863
comes back into town next week.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.491
 Yeah, I'm not looking
forward to that.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.409
LOU: Let's not think about it.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.328
Besides, you're a
trained soldier.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.621
It'll be fine, right?

Congratulations, I
heard the good news.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.214
 I know, right?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.800
[laughter]

08:30.093 --> 08:31.761
 So what do you think, Jack?

08:31.886 --> 08:34.389
 Well, he doesn't
read the cow right.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.433
Pretty slow on his turns.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.058
 Do you think he'll improve?

08:38.183 --> 08:40.687
JACK: Oh, maybe
with more training.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.440
But if you're
asking me if I think

08:43.565 --> 08:44.941
he's going to be a
champion one day,

08:45.066 --> 08:46.985
you're not going
to like my answer.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.696
 Well, we're not going
to give up just yet.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.449
I'd love to keep him for a few
days and see what we can do.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.408
 All right.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.659
Well, thanks.

back to the clinic.

I'll see you guys later.

 Hey, Scott.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.545
I forgot to tell you we're
having a big dinner tonight

09:05.670 --> 09:06.838
to celebrate my engagement.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.424
You should definitely come.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.800
 I'd love to.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.385
But I have a lot of
work to catch up on.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.762
 Please?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.847
It's not like I get
married every day.

09:15.972 --> 09:16.931

 Yeah, OK.
Sure.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.767
 I know.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.980
 OK, well, see you at dinner.

11:00.076 --> 11:00.827
[knocking]

11:00.952 --> 11:02.871
 I'll get it.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.456
LISA: That smells good.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.331
LOU: Yeah, I hope so.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.583
 Hey, Scott.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.625
SCOTT: Hi, how's it going?
- Scott?

11:07.751 --> 11:08.793
JACK: Well, Scott.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.462
SCOTT: Jack.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.796
LOU: What a surprise.

11:11.921 --> 11:12.964
What brings you by?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.341
MALLORY: I invited him.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.675
Since it's my big night
and all, I thought

11:15.800 --> 11:17.052
the more the merrier, right?

11:17.177 --> 11:18.553
 Yeah, of course.
Absolutely.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.846
LISA: Well, it's
very nice you could

11:19.971 --> 11:21.056
join our little celebration.

11:21.181 --> 11:21.890
 It is.

11:22.015 --> 11:22.766
Can I get you a beer here?

11:22.891 --> 11:23.641
 Yeah, sure.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.726
Thanks.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.354
 Come on into the living room.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.522
 Thank you.

11:29.647 --> 11:33.485
 Mallory, you're not trying
to play matchmaker with Lou

11:33.610 --> 11:34.402
and Scott are you?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.737
 Of course not.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.322
But, I mean, Peter
is out of the way.

11:37.447 --> 11:41.493
So I don't know,
anything can happen.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.869
LOU: Oh, I got it.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.210
Jake, look at you all grown up.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.711
I mean, of course
you're grown up.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.004
You're getting married.

11:53.129 --> 11:53.922
 It's good to see you, Lou.

11:54.047 --> 11:54.881
Thank you for having me.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.007
LOU: Yeah, of course.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.217
Where are my manners?

11:57.342 --> 11:58.218
Jake, Mitch.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.803
Mitch, Jake.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.262
 Oh, we were
just-- we just met.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.098
 Why don't you head
on in the house?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.934
I just have to have a word
with Mitch about something,

12:06.059 --> 12:07.227
stuff that's not important.
Come here.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.269
 What?

12:08.395 --> 12:09.771
What, is everything OK?

12:09.896 --> 12:12.273
 No, everything is not OK.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.608
Mallory invited Scott.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.695
And he's in the house right now.

12:16.820 --> 12:17.696
 Who?

12:17.821 --> 12:20.615
 Scott Cardinal, the vet.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.283
 OK, so?

12:22.409 --> 12:26.287
 So Scott and I, ages ago,
long before Peter and I--

12:26.413 --> 12:27.122
 Oh, God.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.373
He's another ex, isn't he?

12:28.498 --> 12:29.791
 Very past tense, OK?

12:29.916 --> 12:31.543
Like a million years ago.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.129
But still, telling everybody
about us in front of him,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.046
it's--

12:35.171 --> 12:36.464
it's going to be awkward.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.590
 Yeah, but it was like
a million years ago.

12:37.716 --> 12:38.925
What does it matter?

12:39.050 --> 12:42.637
 It just-- it doesn't
feel right, OK?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.514
Look, I know you're
disappointed.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.182
But we've waited this long.

12:46.307 --> 12:51.479
What's a couple more days or
weeks or whatever it takes?

12:51.604 --> 12:53.440
But I promise we're
going to tell everyone

12:53.565 --> 12:55.483
when the time is right, OK?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.530
 OK.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.990
 Thanks for understanding.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.165
[music playing]

13:15.879 --> 13:17.130
AMY: What's wrong?

13:17.255 --> 13:18.715
Did you forget where
the garbage can is?

13:18.840 --> 13:21.509
 Can you actually
take it outside?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.136
I want to get dressed
before dinner.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.262
 Yeah, sure.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.180
 Thanks.

13:30.602 --> 13:31.519
 Hey.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.520
Mitch.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.480
MITCH: Hey, Amy.

13:33.605 --> 13:34.647
I got you this.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.524
 Oh.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.902
MITCH: Well, I mean it's not for
you specifically because you're

13:39.027 --> 13:41.112
pregnant, obviously.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.697
LOU: You know, why don't I
just open that up right now?

13:42.822 --> 13:43.698
 Sure.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.784
 Yeah.

13:45.909 --> 13:46.993
Thank you.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.209
[cutlery clinking]

13:58.713 --> 14:04.302
JACK: OK, before we get
too far in to dinner,

14:04.427 --> 14:09.599
I wanted to say a few
words for Mallory and Jake.

14:09.724 --> 14:14.479
I have known them since
they were little kids.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.440
But when I look at
the two of you now,

14:17.565 --> 14:21.695
it's pretty obvious that
you're not so little anymore.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.571
So here's the thing.

14:23.697 --> 14:28.410
There's no blueprint for
building the perfect marriage.

14:28.535 --> 14:33.206
But it sure helps if you've
got a solid foundation.

14:33.331 --> 14:37.210
Mallory and Jake, they've
been building that foundation

14:37.335 --> 14:41.339
for nigh on 10 years,
first as friends,

14:41.464 --> 14:44.759
and now, there's this
lovely couple that's

14:44.884 --> 14:46.428
sitting at our table tonight.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.100
I just want to say
congratulations.

14:52.225 --> 14:56.438
And here's to a
wonderful, happy future.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.397
 Cheers.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.857
 Cheers, guys.

14:58.982 --> 14:59.774
 Cheers.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.734
 Cheers.

15:00.859 --> 15:01.651
 Cheers.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.736
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

15:02.861 --> 15:03.737
 Cheers.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.030
JAKE: Thanks, Jack.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.865
And thank you all
for having us over.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.950
It means a lot to Mallory and I.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.410
 Yeah, thanks, everyone.

15:10.535 --> 15:13.121
Of all the free meals I've
mooched from you guys,

15:13.246 --> 15:15.123
this is definitely the best one.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.417
 So do you have
any honeymoon plans?

15:17.542 --> 15:18.918
 We haven't really
talked about it.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.837
But I mean, I'm sure
we'll go somewhere.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.881
 I wouldn't mind staying
around in Hudson for a while,

15:23.006 --> 15:23.757
you know?

15:23.882 --> 15:25.300
Lay down some roots.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.010
 Well, we're not
going to plant them

15:27.135 --> 15:28.803
too deep because there's
still a lot of traveling

15:28.928 --> 15:30.513
that we'd like to do.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.390
 I just meant it might be
nice to be home for a while.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.811
 We'll talk about that later.

15:36.936 --> 15:41.149
 Scott, grandpa and I worked
with Tab a little more today.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.942
 How's that working out?

15:43.068 --> 15:43.902
 Not great.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.528
He's a good horse.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.988
But he's definitely not going
to be a champion cutter.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.324
 Yeah, well, thanks for trying.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.826
Hopefully, he'll find a
better home at the auction.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.620
 Wait, are you serious?

15:53.745 --> 15:55.455
His owner is going to sell
him because he's not winning?

15:55.580 --> 15:57.499
 Yeah, it actually
happens a lot.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.376
MITCH: Yeah, no,
especially in this economy.

15:59.501 --> 16:02.170
People can't afford to hold onto
horses that aren't performing.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.672
 What happens if no
one wants to buy him?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.632
MALLORY: Well, everyone
knows that if the horses

16:05.757 --> 16:08.593
don't sell at the auction, then
they end up on the meat truck.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.763
 What's the meat truck?

16:11.888 --> 16:14.182
LISA: Honey, aren't your hands
all yucky from the gravy?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.434
Why don't you go give them wash?

16:16.559 --> 16:17.936
 OK.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.604
 I am so sorry.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.106
 It's OK.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.649
Who could that be?

16:22.774 --> 16:25.735
I'll get it.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.239
 Georgie, does the Extreme
Team need any more horses?

16:29.364 --> 16:30.949
 Yeah, Natalie
is always looking

16:31.074 --> 16:31.825
for a good trick riding horse.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.159
Why?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.828
 Well, I know this
is a long shot.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.789
But maybe we could retrain Tab
to be a trick riding horse.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.249
 Really?

16:39.374 --> 16:41.292
 Yeah, I mean, I'd
rather sell him to Natalie

16:41.418 --> 16:42.919
than him go to an auction.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.797
GEORGIE: OK, yeah.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.758
 Georgie, Adam's outside.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.719
I told him that we're
in the middle of dinner.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.679
He says he wants to talk to you.

16:52.804 --> 16:53.930
 OK.

16:54.055 --> 16:54.514
 Do you want me
to send him away?

16:54.639 --> 16:55.473
 It's fine.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.528
Before you say anything,
I haven't changed my mind.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.445
So--

17:09.570 --> 17:11.114
 That's not why I'm here.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.825
I need my math textbook to
study for the test on Monday.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.828
It's in your room.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.247
Can you get it for me, please?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.458
 Yeah.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.627
 And you might as well get
the rest of my stuff too.

17:24.752 --> 17:30.425
The comic books I lent and
the jacket, the blue one.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.094
 You need all that right now?

17:33.219 --> 17:35.347
 No, I just don't want
to come back for it.

17:38.767 --> 17:39.601
 OK.

17:49.778 --> 17:53.782
 So, you two, when Ty
and I first got married,

17:53.907 --> 17:55.992
the question everyone
wanted to know was when

17:56.117 --> 17:57.035
are you going to have kids?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.787
So just be prepared.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.205
 But don't feel like you have
to answer them because it's

18:00.330 --> 18:01.164
nobody's business but yours.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.123
LISA: No.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.375
Nobody's business.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.211
But when are you
going to have kids?

18:06.336 --> 18:09.255
 One day, for sure.

18:09.381 --> 18:14.844
 One day in the very,
very distant future.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.681
 Not too distant, I hope.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.766
MALLORY: Another thing
we can talk about later.

18:34.572 --> 18:35.490
 Thank you.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.162
 That's it?

18:41.287 --> 18:44.332
 Yep, that's it.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.168
 You're just going to leave
without saying anything?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.670
 You're the one who
broke up with me, right?

19:03.977 --> 19:06.813
[music playing]

19:08.773 --> 19:10.525
LOU: Well, there
wasn't enough time

19:10.650 --> 19:12.360
to order a real wedding cake.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.279
But this should do the trick.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.238
 Wow, that's amazing, Lou.

19:15.363 --> 19:16.614
Thank you.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.200
 Mallory, why don't
you do the honors?

19:19.325 --> 19:22.787
[music playing]

19:25.832 --> 19:26.708
Mallory?

19:32.172 --> 19:33.298
Mallory?

19:35.967 --> 19:36.718
 I'm so sorry.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.053
Jake, I can't--

19:38.178 --> 19:39.054
Jake, I can't do this.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.055
 You can't what?

19:40.180 --> 19:41.014
Cut the cake?

19:41.139 --> 19:42.223
 I can't marry you.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.573
[knocking]

19:58.698 --> 20:00.992
 Jake just left.

20:01.117 --> 20:01.910
I thought you'd want to know.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.707
 You must think
I'm such a fool.

20:07.832 --> 20:08.833
 No, I don't.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.922
 I don't know what
happened, Jack.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.758
I saw the bride and the groom
standing on top of the cake.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.803
And they just looked cemented
in the icing, like they couldn't

20:19.928 --> 20:23.807
move, stuck there in one place
for the rest of their life

20:23.932 --> 20:26.142
together forever.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.269
 That's a bit dramatic,
don't you think?

20:28.395 --> 20:29.688
MALLORY: Maybe a little.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.357
But I realized that
Jake wants to settle

20:32.482 --> 20:33.900
down and have a family.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.361
And I'm just not
ready for that yet.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.446
 Well, it's better
to realize that now

20:38.571 --> 20:40.448
than after you walk
down the aisle.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.953
 I used to think
that two people were

20:45.078 --> 20:48.081
meant to be together, you know?

20:48.206 --> 20:49.374
Like it's written in the stars.

20:52.043 --> 20:54.713
But I think that's just a stupid
story they tell little girls,

20:54.838 --> 20:56.965
right?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.591
Jake and I aren't
meant to be together

20:58.717 --> 21:01.970
any more than Lou and Scott.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.763
 Lou and Scott?

21:03.888 --> 21:06.266
Don't tell me that's why
you invited him for dinner.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.310
MALLORY: I realize now how
monumentally idiotic that was.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.438
But how was I supposed
to know that she was

21:11.563 --> 21:12.772
all hot and heavy with Mitch?

21:17.110 --> 21:19.529
Oops.

21:19.654 --> 21:21.614
I don't think I'm
supposed to know that.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.950
Can you just forget what I said?

21:24.075 --> 21:26.453
 At my age, I forget
a lot of things.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.663
I'm pretty sure I won't
be forgetting that.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.712
Now, what are you doing?

21:35.837 --> 21:37.130
 Packing.

21:37.255 --> 21:38.506
I'm going to head off
first thing in the morning.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.050
JACK: Oh, don't be silly.

21:40.175 --> 21:43.470
Stay for a few days.

21:43.595 --> 21:47.557
Mallory, you're in
no state of mind

21:47.682 --> 21:49.517
to be making big decisions.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.645
You need to just
slow down, at least

21:52.771 --> 21:53.938
until you get your bearings.

21:54.064 --> 21:54.856
What do you say?

21:59.152 --> 22:01.404
 This was supposed to be
the best day of my life.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.530
How did it become the worst?

22:08.787 --> 22:12.832
 I know it seems
bad at the moment.

22:12.957 --> 22:17.545
But things will be
clearer in the morning.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.222
 You sure you're up for this?

22:27.347 --> 22:28.223
 Yeah.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.934
Yeah, of course.

22:31.059 --> 22:33.436
 Georgie, last night at
dinner, when Adam stopped by--

22:33.561 --> 22:35.397
 I don't want to
talk about Adam.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.856
I'm just here to work.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.066
 OK.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.192
Let's get started then.

22:39.317 --> 22:40.485
[music playing]

22:40.610 --> 22:41.361
JACK: [inaudible] .

22:41.486 --> 22:42.862
Nice easy pace.

22:42.987 --> 22:43.905
Keep it moving.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.826
[mooing]

22:47.951 --> 22:50.704
MITCH: So, that was quite
the dinner last night, huh?

22:50.829 --> 22:51.746
JACK: Yeah.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.627
MITCH: Something
eating you, Jack?

22:57.752 --> 23:02.757
 Yeah, I don't like secrets.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.342
It's fine if people got them.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.886
I just don't want
to know about them.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.805
See, that's the
problem with secrets.

23:08.930 --> 23:13.018
They don't stay
secret for very long.

23:13.143 --> 23:15.478
 I'm taking a guess
here, but I figure

23:15.603 --> 23:17.355
you know about me and Lou.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.024
 Well, I don't want to.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.401
But yeah, I do.

23:21.526 --> 23:23.903
 Look, Jack, we were going
to tell everybody last night.

23:24.029 --> 23:26.781
Things just turned upside down.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.868
 It doesn't exactly surprise
me that the two of you

23:29.993 --> 23:31.161
ended up together.

23:31.286 --> 23:34.914
So all that I'm going
to say about it is this.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.584
Lou's been through a lot
the last couple of years.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.545
So I trust you'll
treat her right.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.756
 I will, I swear.

23:42.881 --> 23:45.967
 That's all we need
to say about it.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.137
 Oh, I was sweating
bullets thinking

23:49.262 --> 23:50.680
about telling you today.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.058
 Well, don't sweat
bullets on my account.

23:53.183 --> 23:54.476
Save that for Tim.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.771
 Yeah, got any advice?

23:57.896 --> 23:59.856
 Sure.

23:59.981 --> 24:05.403
That trailer you sleep in, it's
got a lock on the door, right?

24:05.528 --> 24:07.405
MITCH: Yeah, why?

24:07.530 --> 24:10.075
 Well, I suggest you use it.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.161
Just sleep with one
eye open, maybe both.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.045
 Hey, Mallory.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.297
How are you doing?

24:24.422 --> 24:28.510
 I'm a sinking ship on
a vast ocean of despair.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.472
Jake won't return
my phone calls.

24:32.597 --> 24:34.599
But I guess I deserve that.

24:34.724 --> 24:37.977
 Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

24:38.103 --> 24:40.522
 On the bright side, I booked
my ticket back to London.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.940
 When you leave?

24:42.065 --> 24:43.233
 Tomorrow.

24:43.358 --> 24:45.110
But I want to make
myself useful until then.

24:45.235 --> 24:48.154
So if you need anybody to
muck out or clean the tack,

24:48.279 --> 24:49.614
I'm your girl.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.367
 Actually, I could
use your help with Tab.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.869
[music playing]

24:56.621 --> 24:57.872
OK, Georgie.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.207
Why don't you start by
stepping on and off,

24:59.332 --> 25:02.043
and then we'll build
up slowly from there?

25:02.168 --> 25:03.420
GEORGIE: Come on, boy.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.671
Let's go.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.634
Go on.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.015
 Yeah, that's it.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.558
Keep him moving
forward, Mallory.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.143
GEORGIE: Let's go, boy.

25:18.268 --> 25:21.146
Come on.

25:21.271 --> 25:22.188
Good boy.

25:25.275 --> 25:28.153
[music playing]

25:36.077 --> 25:37.787
Tab's running a
lot smoother now.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.456
I don't think he needs
to be ponied anymore.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.958
 OK, well after our break, then
we'll try with just the reins.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.418
 I'm parched.
Do you have anything to drink?

25:43.543 --> 25:45.253
 Yeah, there should be
some iced tea in the fridge.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.713
I have a call scheduled with Ty.

25:46.838 --> 25:47.922
But it shouldn't take long.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.845
[phone ringing]

25:57.682 --> 25:59.184
 Yo, what's up, Amy?

25:59.309 --> 26:00.602
 Bob.
Hey.

26:00.727 --> 26:01.561
 You look huge.

26:01.686 --> 26:02.896
TY: Hey!

26:03.021 --> 26:04.939
Don't call her huge, you idiot.

26:05.065 --> 26:05.732
 Sorry.

26:05.857 --> 26:06.900
You look tiny.

26:07.025 --> 26:08.902
I can't even tell
you're pregnant.

26:09.027 --> 26:09.694
 Thanks.

26:09.819 --> 26:11.154
What is Ty doing?

26:11.279 --> 26:12.947
 Oh, he's hanging out
with his new friends.

26:13.073 --> 26:16.451
 Just in the middle of
innoculating the herd here.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.370
 Hi, Ty.

26:18.495 --> 26:20.080
 Oh hey, Georgie.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.582
 Hello, fellow world traveler.

26:22.707 --> 26:24.709
 Mallory, I heard
you were in town.

26:24.834 --> 26:25.794
Look at you.

26:25.919 --> 26:26.753
How long has it been?

26:26.878 --> 26:28.338
 It's been too long.

26:28.463 --> 26:30.382
Yeah, no offense, Ty,
but your fashion sense

26:30.507 --> 26:31.549
has kind of gone downhill.

26:31.675 --> 26:34.678
You look a little homeless.

26:34.803 --> 26:35.887
 Well, it's good
to see you too.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.555
Can you put Amy back on?

26:37.681 --> 26:38.556
 Bye.

26:38.682 --> 26:39.641
 Hey, you look busy.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.142
I'll let you go.
I love you.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.227
 I love you too.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.770
Miss you.

26:43.895 --> 26:46.648
 Aw, aren't you two so
adorable. (KISSING NOISES)

26:46.773 --> 26:47.857
 OK, OK.
OK.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.234
All right.
Bye, Bob.

26:49.359 --> 26:51.152
[laughs]

26:54.197 --> 26:55.490
 Oh my God.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.242
I'm such an idiot.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.243
 What?

26:58.368 --> 26:59.661
 You and Ty are together.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.287
But you're in
different countries.

27:01.413 --> 27:04.165
And it doesn't matter
because you love each other.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.917
And you support each
other no matter what.

27:06.042 --> 27:08.670
 Well yeah, that's kind of
what marriage is all about.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.839
MALLORY: If I wanted
to go to Mongolia,

27:10.964 --> 27:12.549
Jake would totally support me.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.217
He wouldn't even ask why.

27:14.342 --> 27:18.179
He would just go online and
search for the best airfare.

27:18.304 --> 27:21.766
He-- Jake would
never stand in my way

27:21.891 --> 27:25.145
if I wanted to do something,
even if it was deep sea diving

27:25.270 --> 27:27.981
or dyeing my hair
eggplant purple.

27:28.106 --> 27:30.108
 Well, you and Jake have
always been good friends.

27:30.233 --> 27:34.279
 Yeah, and he's been my
best friend for 10 years.

27:34.404 --> 27:37.157
I love him.

27:37.282 --> 27:39.451
I love him.

27:39.576 --> 27:40.493
I have to go.

27:40.618 --> 27:41.661
 Well, where are you going?

27:41.786 --> 27:42.704
 I'm going to go find Jake.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.122
Maybe it's not too late.

27:44.247 --> 27:45.874
 Mallory, you should
think about this first.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.542
 No, that's the problem.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.877
I've been thinking way too much.

27:54.591 --> 27:57.177
[music playing]

27:57.302 --> 27:58.678
AMY: OK, Georgie.
Good job.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.013
Let's see if he
knows the pattern.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.196
That was great.

28:16.321 --> 28:19.532
 I think he's ready to
try it without the reins.

28:19.657 --> 28:20.450
 OK.

28:20.575 --> 28:21.409
 All right.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.544
Good boy.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.922
Ah!

28:34.047 --> 28:36.925
Why are you stopping?

28:37.050 --> 28:38.259
AMY: Georgie, just bring him in.

28:42.847 --> 28:43.682
 What happened?

28:43.807 --> 28:44.766
 I don't know.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.267
 Maybe you were going too fast?

28:46.393 --> 28:48.395
 Maybe not fast enough.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.522
While Tab's loping, he has
too much time to think.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.607
If we gallop it, his
instincts will kick in.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.359
 I don't know, Georgie.

28:54.484 --> 28:56.528
If he stops again, then it
could become a really bad habit.

28:56.653 --> 28:57.862
And you could get hurt.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.239
 We can do it at a gallop.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.908
I know we can.

29:02.033 --> 29:03.451
 OK, I believe you.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.995
But I think he's had
enough for today.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.580
Why don't we try first
thing in the morning?

29:07.706 --> 29:08.790
 OK.

29:08.915 --> 29:12.460
[music playing]

29:26.516 --> 29:27.434
 Hey.

29:27.559 --> 29:28.476
Nice wheels.

29:31.021 --> 29:32.230
 I got your text.

29:32.355 --> 29:33.898
What did you want to tell me?

29:34.024 --> 29:35.650
 Last night, I got scared.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.445
And I'm sorry.

29:38.570 --> 29:39.446
 OK well, have a nice life.

29:39.571 --> 29:40.321
 Hey, Jake.

29:40.447 --> 29:41.322
Wait.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.702
Today, I saw Ty in Mongolia.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.954
And I saw Amy retraining
a cutting horse.

29:48.079 --> 29:49.330
They're married.

29:49.456 --> 29:51.166
And they're still both
doing what they love

29:51.291 --> 29:53.501
because marriage is more
than just settling down

29:53.626 --> 29:54.836
and having kids.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.087
JAKE: Settling down
and having kids

29:56.212 --> 29:58.423
isn't the reason why
I proposed to you.

29:58.548 --> 29:59.758
 It's not?

29:59.883 --> 30:02.177
JAKE: No, I just
want to be with you.

30:02.302 --> 30:04.471
If that means spending the
rest of our lives traveling

30:04.596 --> 30:07.182
around the world,
then I'm on board.

30:07.307 --> 30:10.310
As long as we're in it together,
that's all I've ever wanted.

30:10.435 --> 30:11.644
 That's all I want.

30:11.770 --> 30:13.188
 Are you sure?

30:13.313 --> 30:14.731
Because you change your
mind like the wind, Mallory.

30:14.856 --> 30:15.982
I can't keep up with you.

30:16.107 --> 30:19.986
 I got cold feet, that's all.

30:20.111 --> 30:21.321
I do want to marry you.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.198
I promise I won't
change my mind again.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.453
 After you broke things
off, I decided to start

30:28.578 --> 30:30.205
driving down to Mexico.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.707
I borrowed that from my cousin.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.334
 Mexico?

30:34.459 --> 30:38.213
Wow, that would be
an amazing adventure.

30:38.338 --> 30:43.385
 I think I'm still going to go.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.261
 OK, I'll come with you.

30:45.387 --> 30:47.055
 No, I'm going to
do this by myself.

30:49.849 --> 30:50.892
Bye, Mallory.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.915
LOU: How did he
find out about us?

31:14.040 --> 31:14.833
 I don't know.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.001
Does it matter?

31:16.126 --> 31:17.085
I'm glad he knows.

31:17.210 --> 31:18.128
Cat's out of the bag.

31:18.253 --> 31:19.587
We can tell everybody now.

31:19.713 --> 31:21.131
 I don't know.

31:21.256 --> 31:22.173
I'm worried about how
Georgie is going to react.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.509
She's fragile right now.

31:24.634 --> 31:25.719
 Why?

31:25.844 --> 31:26.928
Because her and
Adam are fighting?

31:27.053 --> 31:28.930
LOU: No, it's more than a fight.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.181
I'm pretty sure they broke up.

31:30.306 --> 31:32.517
And she's heartbroken.

31:32.642 --> 31:33.935
The last thing she's
going to want to hear

31:34.060 --> 31:35.729
is that you and I are together.

31:35.854 --> 31:37.313
 Is that really the reason?

31:37.439 --> 31:40.608
Or are you just avoiding
telling your daughters about us?

31:40.734 --> 31:42.235
 How can you say that?

31:42.360 --> 31:44.154
 You keep waiting for the
perfect time to tell everybody.

31:44.279 --> 31:47.073
But there's not going
to be a perfect time.

31:47.198 --> 31:49.659
I don't want to
pretend that I'm just--

31:49.784 --> 31:52.537
I'm just the ranch hand
to you girls anymore.

31:52.662 --> 31:54.748
I want this to be real.

31:54.873 --> 31:55.623
I thought you did too.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.049
 Good boy, Tab.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.884
You worked hard
today, didn't you?

32:06.009 --> 32:07.302
Hey?

32:07.427 --> 32:08.345
You're sweet.

32:08.470 --> 32:11.306
Good boy.

32:11.431 --> 32:13.266
 Hey, Georgie.

32:13.391 --> 32:14.934
I have some bad news.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.519
 What is it?

32:16.644 --> 32:17.812
 Scott just called.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.564
He's coming to pick
up Tab tomorrow.

32:19.689 --> 32:21.232
 We're not finished
training him yet.

32:21.358 --> 32:22.359
 I know.

32:22.484 --> 32:23.610
But the owner
doesn't want to wait.

32:23.735 --> 32:26.237
He's putting Tab in
an auction tomorrow.

32:26.363 --> 32:27.572
 He can't.

32:27.697 --> 32:29.574
We're selling him
to the Extreme Team.

32:29.699 --> 32:31.701
 We made some great
progress today.

32:31.826 --> 32:34.913
But he is far from finished
trick riding horse.

32:35.038 --> 32:36.164
He just ran out of time.

32:44.464 --> 32:45.423
 Here, honey.

32:50.303 --> 32:53.556
MALLORY: Everyone is so quiet.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.142
I lost the love
of my life today.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.395
What's your excuse?

32:58.520 --> 33:01.564
AMY: So I take it things
didn't go very well with Jake?

33:01.690 --> 33:05.360
 That's the
understatement of the year.

33:05.485 --> 33:06.986
But this is my last night here.

33:07.112 --> 33:11.074
So let's focus on the positive.

33:11.199 --> 33:13.827
Here's to good things
on the horizon.

baby, Lou's new man--

33:23.378 --> 33:24.796
Thanks to everyone
for making me feel

33:24.921 --> 33:27.048
welcome in the past few days.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.341
 Well, cheers to all of that.

33:28.466 --> 33:29.384
ALL: Cheers.

33:32.512 --> 33:33.471
 You know what?

33:33.596 --> 33:35.056
Actually, there
is something I've

33:35.181 --> 33:38.768
been meaning to tell you all.

33:38.893 --> 33:43.023
The reason I invited Mitch for
dinner yesterday was that I--

33:43.148 --> 33:48.528
we wanted to tell everyone about
us, about our relationship.

33:48.653 --> 33:51.698
KATIE: What's a relationship?

33:51.823 --> 33:53.742
 Well, honey, a
relationship is when

33:53.867 --> 33:56.578
two people like each other,
and they want to spend

33:56.703 --> 33:57.245
a lot of time together.

33:57.370 --> 33:58.413
 That's a great idea.

33:58.538 --> 33:59.414
I love Mitch.

34:03.710 --> 34:04.669
LOU: Georgie.

34:04.794 --> 34:06.087
 Just let her be.

35:06.690 --> 35:10.276
 (CRYING)

35:13.238 --> 35:16.741
 Honey, are you OK?

35:16.866 --> 35:19.577
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

35:19.703 --> 35:21.121
Please talk to me.

35:21.246 --> 35:22.205
Please.

35:22.330 --> 35:24.165
 I don't know what's wrong.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.626
I can't stop feeling like this.

35:26.751 --> 35:27.877
I'm the one who
broke up with Adam,

35:28.003 --> 35:31.131
so why does it hurt
so much? (CRYING)

35:31.256 --> 35:33.675
 Come here.

35:33.800 --> 35:37.137
Shh, it's OK.

35:37.262 --> 35:38.304
It's OK.

35:41.141 --> 35:42.684
Shh, it's OK.

35:46.104 --> 35:47.022
Is that OK?

35:47.147 --> 35:47.981
GEORGIE: Yeah.

35:48.106 --> 35:50.025
 Oh, sorry, sweetie.

35:50.150 --> 35:53.028
GEORGIE: OK, it's not that bad.

35:53.153 --> 35:55.447
I've had way worse falls.

35:55.572 --> 35:59.868
 Well, a bruised elbow is easy.

35:59.993 --> 36:03.663
A little ice, and
you're good as new.

36:03.788 --> 36:08.293
But a broken heart
is a lot harder.

36:08.418 --> 36:11.004
Trust me, I know.

36:11.129 --> 36:14.632
When things with your dad
ended, I thought I would

36:14.758 --> 36:17.218
never feel like myself again.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.304
 But then you
moved on with Mitch.

36:22.140 --> 36:23.224
 How do you feel about that?

36:26.770 --> 36:29.022
 I don't know.

36:29.147 --> 36:31.191
Getting used to you
dating was one thing.

36:31.316 --> 36:34.694
But you being in an actual
relationship is a little weird.

36:38.198 --> 36:39.240
I like Mitch, though.

36:41.993 --> 36:45.747
 And you know, even though it
doesn't feel like it right now,

36:45.872 --> 36:47.916
eventually, you're going
to be ready to move on too.

36:51.044 --> 36:53.088
 I just wish Adam trusted me.

36:53.213 --> 36:56.424
But he didn't.

36:56.549 --> 36:57.342
 Why?

36:57.467 --> 36:59.010
What do you mean?

36:59.135 --> 37:00.095
 He read my texts.

37:00.220 --> 37:03.556
And now, I can never trust him.

37:03.682 --> 37:06.017
 Yeah, well you can't have
a relationship without trust,

37:06.142 --> 37:07.227
can you?

37:10.397 --> 37:13.400
GEORGIE: Wait!

37:13.525 --> 37:15.360
I know why Tab's stopping
when I drop the reins.

37:15.485 --> 37:17.946
He doesn't trust the feeling
of me standing in the saddle.

37:18.071 --> 37:21.616
 OK, so what do we do about it?

37:21.741 --> 37:23.493
GEORGIE: I just need more time.

37:23.618 --> 37:25.912
 The owner is waiting for
me at the auction house.

37:26.037 --> 37:27.497
GEORGIE: Please, Scott.

37:27.622 --> 37:29.374
I can prove Tab will be a
great trick riding horse.

37:29.499 --> 37:31.751
Just give me a chance.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.169
 All right.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.588
I'll call the owner, tell
him the truck broke down.

37:35.714 --> 37:37.424
That'll buy us a
couple more hours.

37:37.549 --> 37:38.425
 That's all I need.

 Yeah, of course.

as he used to be.

 OK.

What is this?

38:58.713 --> 39:01.383
Must be tourists

39:01.508 --> 39:02.550
 That's not tourists.

39:20.777 --> 39:23.071
 OK, there's some
things I got to say,

39:23.196 --> 39:24.447
things that need saying.

39:24.572 --> 39:28.451
Number one, you
talk way too much.

39:28.576 --> 39:33.039
Number two, you waffle
about everything.

39:33.164 --> 39:35.625
And number three, you're
always sticking your nose

39:35.750 --> 39:36.960

39:37.085 --> 39:38.128

way to tell me that?

of those things, I couldn't
imagine my life without you.

you for the last time,

39:50.348 --> 39:56.312
