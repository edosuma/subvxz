WEBVTT

00:02.681 --> 00:06.286
So Owen can eat pretty much anything
he wants at this point, right?

00:06.310 --> 00:07.579
Except peanut butter.

00:07.603 --> 00:09.622
He gets little hives when
he eats peanut butter.

00:09.646 --> 00:11.615
Ross, you know, he sort
of feeds himself now.

00:11.648 --> 00:13.710
No kidding? That's amazing.

00:13.734 --> 00:14.669
Not really.

00:14.693 --> 00:17.422
I mean, he's 16 months. It'd
be kind of scary if he didn't.

00:17.446 --> 00:21.625
See, I, I didn't know that, and this thing
he's doing, for example, right now,

00:21.992 --> 00:24.794
squinching up his face and holding
his breath, what does that mean?

00:26.121 --> 00:27.724
- Bless you.
- God bless you.

00:27.748 --> 00:29.257
He's playing a game, right?

00:29.416 --> 00:30.717
No, he's pooping.

00:33.086 --> 00:34.262
Oh.

00:35.797 --> 00:36.858
Oh, right.

00:36.882 --> 00:40.060
I'll change him. I can't
smell anything, anyway.

00:40.427 --> 00:42.145
How do you know what
kind of diapers to use?

00:42.554 --> 00:44.981
I mean, do you buy them all, and
then kind of let him decide?

00:50.103 --> 00:51.821
Okay, um,

00:52.773 --> 00:55.585
about a year and a half ago,
I put my name on this list,

00:55.609 --> 00:58.463
and I filled out some forms and
I went in for an interview

00:58.487 --> 01:01.998
and I didn't say anything about it because I
really didn't believe anything would happen.

01:02.324 --> 01:04.876
I mean, at least, not
for a really long time.

01:05.953 --> 01:08.640
I mean, you know, being
a single guy, and...

01:08.664 --> 01:11.466
But I've wanted this
for a long time,

01:11.625 --> 01:16.471
so anyway, about 36 hours
ago, this baby girl was born,

01:18.298 --> 01:22.519
and, amazingly, yesterday
the agency called.

01:24.304 --> 01:26.856
So that's why diapers kind
of matter to me right now.

01:27.057 --> 01:28.326
Wow!

01:28.350 --> 01:29.494
Ross.

01:29.518 --> 01:31.111
Ross!

01:31.228 --> 01:32.529
That's great!

01:33.397 --> 01:34.499
It's so exciting.

01:34.523 --> 01:36.282
Oh, it's great.

01:39.903 --> 01:41.162
Something going on?

01:41.405 --> 01:43.623
You'll never guess
who's having a baby.

01:49.454 --> 01:51.849
The thing is, we were
always so careful.

01:51.873 --> 01:54.185
I mean, we have never
not been careful.

01:54.209 --> 01:55.552
Not once, right?

01:55.585 --> 01:58.398
Twenty five, 24, 23...

01:58.422 --> 02:01.192
And you always use a
real, established brand,

02:01.216 --> 02:04.185
not, like, "Jerry's Condoms"
or anything, right?

02:04.428 --> 02:06.698
Seventeen, 16, 15...

02:06.722 --> 02:09.441
So there's no way.

02:09.975 --> 02:11.735
I mean, there's no way, right?

02:12.019 --> 02:15.613
Right. None. Zero. Zip.

02:19.276 --> 02:22.203
I know I'm pregnant.
I just know it.

02:24.698 --> 02:25.957
Oh, God.

02:31.038 --> 02:33.558
Look, I just want you to know...

02:33.582 --> 02:34.966
Uh-huh.

02:35.792 --> 02:38.053
- Whatever happens...
- Mmm-hmm.

02:38.420 --> 02:41.348
I am never, ever
having sex again.

02:42.007 --> 02:43.350
Mmm-hmm.

Hey, Jule, what do you think?

03:42.776 --> 03:44.670
Why are you guys in
such a good mood?

03:44.694 --> 03:48.915
What? Oh, we're, uh...
We're celebrating.

03:49.116 --> 03:50.625
Celebrating what?

03:50.826 --> 03:52.168
Um...

03:52.494 --> 03:55.431
The way things always have a
way of working out in the end.

03:55.455 --> 03:57.100
- This shouldn't go up?
- No.

03:57.124 --> 03:59.560
Hey, tell him the basketball
jersey look is passe, Julia.

03:59.584 --> 04:01.562
Since when are you okay
with a wardrobe consultant?

04:01.586 --> 04:03.856
Since it's been decided
that I have no taste.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.525
Oh.

04:05.549 --> 04:06.901
You know what I need to do?

04:06.925 --> 04:08.903
I need to get my
brother a new jacket.

04:08.927 --> 04:12.615
I left his suede one down in LA,
and man, is he pissed at me.

04:12.639 --> 04:14.482
He loved that coat.

04:14.724 --> 04:15.910
What do you think?

04:15.934 --> 04:17.077
For Justin.

04:17.101 --> 04:20.488
He's kind of into this ratty, old
windbreaker, and if I got him this...

04:20.897 --> 04:22.323
- This one?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:24.192 --> 04:27.745
This is the kind of shirt worn
by men named Barney, Julia.

04:27.988 --> 04:29.674
No, really. Look. See the
buttons on the bottom?

04:29.698 --> 04:31.509
They don't match the top ones.

04:31.533 --> 04:33.928
Beer gut. Not cool.

04:33.952 --> 04:36.296
Now, this...

04:37.330 --> 04:39.642
Now, this is a Dale shirt.

04:39.666 --> 04:41.894
See how the sleeve's
all stretched out,

04:41.918 --> 04:44.188
like the guy pushed it up
to show off his tattoos.

04:44.212 --> 04:45.773
You should get Justin this one.

04:45.797 --> 04:47.056
Okay.

04:47.924 --> 04:51.311
Hey, you're pretty
good at this stuff.

04:51.595 --> 04:53.938
Jill Holbrook, clothing
archaeologist.

04:54.306 --> 04:57.066
I love imagining all the
people who wore this stuff.

04:58.185 --> 05:01.738
One day, I want to have a
store just like this one.

05:03.190 --> 05:06.910
Think I'd be good at it? I
mean, you think I could?

05:07.611 --> 05:08.995
One day?

05:18.371 --> 05:19.756
You bought me clothes?

05:20.749 --> 05:22.268
My mother buys me clothes.

05:22.292 --> 05:24.937
Your mother buys you dickies and
galoshes and things like that.

05:24.961 --> 05:28.024
And, this... This is cool, so
be a pleasant person, hmm?

05:28.048 --> 05:30.735
And open it up and look in
it and tell me you love it

05:30.759 --> 05:34.020
and give me a hug and a kiss and
put it on and never take it off.

05:38.391 --> 05:39.368
What is it?

05:39.392 --> 05:41.787
Well, it's a jacket
and it's '50s-ish

05:41.811 --> 05:43.613
and it's got a pattern. See?

05:43.939 --> 05:45.082
I already have a windbreaker.

05:45.106 --> 05:46.324
Put it on.

05:50.195 --> 05:51.631
You don't like the
way I dress, do you?

05:51.655 --> 05:52.632
I didn't say that.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.008
I'm not cool enough for you?
Is that it?

05:54.032 --> 05:54.967
Your words, not mine.

05:54.991 --> 05:57.136
You're embarrassed to be seen
with me and my windbreaker.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.671
I'm never buying you another
gift, just so you know.

06:04.459 --> 06:05.853
I like it.

06:05.877 --> 06:07.063
I do.

06:07.087 --> 06:08.930
I think it looks great on you.

06:09.464 --> 06:10.848
Don't you?

06:12.634 --> 06:14.070
You're trying to change me.

06:14.094 --> 06:15.937
Already you're
trying to change me.

06:22.852 --> 06:24.195
Oh, Mr. Holbrook,

06:24.396 --> 06:27.198
Hi. It's Bailey. Is Jill there?
We were going to...

06:32.821 --> 06:33.798
"Kleenex."

06:33.822 --> 06:35.581
Oh, double-word score.

06:36.074 --> 06:37.343
Eight, nine, ten...

06:37.367 --> 06:39.585
They gave me one of those
scratch tests on my back.

06:39.619 --> 06:40.596
It was awful.

06:40.620 --> 06:41.838
Bet its seafood.

06:41.997 --> 06:43.349
It's like me with shrimp.

06:43.373 --> 06:46.301
I mean, I have one of those
things, and I blow up, like...

06:46.626 --> 06:51.023
It's really gross. My skin gets all
blotchy and my tongue gets swelled up

06:51.047 --> 06:53.234
and my nose is,
like, mucous city

06:53.258 --> 06:55.893
and my eyes get all
milky and runny and...

06:56.428 --> 06:58.354
And, um...

06:58.555 --> 06:59.490
I'll stop now.

06:59.514 --> 07:00.741
Well, is it seafood?

07:00.765 --> 07:01.983
Uh, no.

07:02.434 --> 07:03.536
It's him.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.954
Who?

07:04.978 --> 07:05.955
Him!

07:05.979 --> 07:07.498
- Thurber?
- Bingo!

07:07.522 --> 07:09.949
Now, after all this time,
you're allergic to Thurber?

07:10.191 --> 07:13.411
I guess I've just been in the house
much more, with my thesis to write.

07:13.945 --> 07:15.548
I don't know. I
can't explain it.

07:15.572 --> 07:17.758
It just kicked in
with a vengeance,

07:17.782 --> 07:19.751
but the point is,
I can't breathe.

07:20.410 --> 07:22.462
So, it's him or me.

07:23.163 --> 07:24.881
Wow. Huh.

07:25.457 --> 07:27.133
Kirsten, where will you go?

07:27.667 --> 07:28.644
Charlie, that's horrible.

07:28.668 --> 07:29.927
Charlie.

07:31.671 --> 07:33.065
Hey.

07:33.089 --> 07:34.474
Okay.

07:36.343 --> 07:37.810
Bay?

07:38.887 --> 07:40.188
What's going on?

07:42.599 --> 07:44.025
She's dead.

07:47.312 --> 07:49.864
Jill. She's dead.

07:50.023 --> 07:51.667
What? I don't get it.

07:51.691 --> 07:52.992
Bailey?

07:53.234 --> 07:54.462
They...

07:54.486 --> 07:57.246
Her mom found her...

07:59.074 --> 08:00.667
...in her room.

08:00.950 --> 08:03.461
There was some, uh...

08:04.788 --> 08:06.047
Cocaine.

08:08.208 --> 08:12.136
Her heart stopped.

08:15.298 --> 08:17.392
I don't know. Uh...

08:21.096 --> 08:23.022
Anyway, that's it.

08:23.932 --> 08:25.608
She's dead.

08:30.063 --> 08:31.948
She's dead.

08:39.614 --> 08:40.789
What do you want, Claud?

08:42.283 --> 08:43.710
I don't know.

08:47.914 --> 08:49.966
I don't understand, Bay.

08:52.919 --> 08:56.806
I thought she was okay. I mean, you
just saw her, and she was okay, right?

08:58.341 --> 09:00.518
And she was in that
program, so...

09:02.387 --> 09:04.147
How could this happen?

09:06.057 --> 09:08.109
How come she had
drugs in her room?

09:10.228 --> 09:11.288
Bailey?

09:11.312 --> 09:13.114
How do I know?

09:14.566 --> 09:16.460
Maybe she bought them from
some creep this afternoon.

09:16.484 --> 09:19.078
Maybe she had them left over.

09:20.238 --> 09:23.207
Maybe she found them on the damn street.
Who the hell cares?

09:23.450 --> 09:25.168
What difference does it make?

09:26.369 --> 09:28.254
So that can happen?

09:31.374 --> 09:33.968
You can just take
something once...

09:35.295 --> 09:36.804
- I can't believe...
- Claudia.

09:38.298 --> 09:40.057
Was she alone?

09:42.510 --> 09:44.645
You think she knew
what was happening?

09:48.808 --> 09:50.485
You think she was scared?

09:51.102 --> 09:52.695
I don't know.

09:57.233 --> 09:58.409
Why are you crying?

10:00.570 --> 10:01.913
Because...

10:05.450 --> 10:06.427
Why aren't you?

10:06.451 --> 10:08.252
Would you please get
out of here, Claudia?

10:09.829 --> 10:11.640
I want to go to the
funeral with you.

10:11.664 --> 10:13.466
- No.
- Why not?

10:13.583 --> 10:15.760
Because I am not going
to any funeral.

10:16.002 --> 10:17.887
What?

10:18.171 --> 10:20.348
I'm not wasting my time, okay?

10:21.466 --> 10:25.144
She wanted to do something stupid, she wanted
to throw everything away, that's fine.

10:25.637 --> 10:28.981
It is her problem. It's her fault.
Not mine.

10:30.892 --> 10:33.820
I'm not crying at her stupid funeral.
She can just forget it.

10:42.654 --> 10:47.625
Why is it when someone dies, people
always say, "But I just saw her"?

10:48.868 --> 10:50.336
Ever notice that?

10:53.164 --> 10:55.550
Like having just seen someone,

10:56.125 --> 10:58.312
having just talked to them
is some sort of guarantee

10:58.336 --> 11:00.847
they're going to be
there the next day.

11:06.010 --> 11:08.646
You'll be here when I wake
up, Charlie, won't you?

11:09.931 --> 11:11.440
I'll be here.

11:15.478 --> 11:17.280
Let's make love, okay?

11:18.773 --> 11:20.449
Okay.

11:43.589 --> 11:46.934
He should be here.
It's not right.

11:48.511 --> 11:52.273
All this talk about a life
lived to the fullest,

11:52.765 --> 11:55.860
and how we're all better
for having known her.

11:56.644 --> 11:58.779
I guess people need
to be comforted.

12:00.189 --> 12:02.491
Why don't they just say
it's a waste, huh?

12:02.775 --> 12:05.995
And that there's no good lesson
in it, and there's no comfort?

12:06.863 --> 12:08.539
It's just a waste.

12:14.829 --> 12:16.422
That's her older brother.

12:18.958 --> 12:20.468
Let's go home, Jule.

12:22.128 --> 12:24.013
He must be really cold, huh?

12:27.675 --> 12:29.101
Come on.

12:41.147 --> 12:44.283
You didn't need to come.
Really, I would've understood.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.702
I thought...

12:47.945 --> 12:50.299
I thought maybe it was a
good idea to bring her,

12:50.323 --> 12:53.334
show her something, I
don't know, wonderful.

12:54.994 --> 12:56.555
She is so beautiful, Ross.

12:56.579 --> 12:57.797
Isn't she?

12:58.831 --> 13:04.563
I mean, even looking at her from a completely
objective, neutral, empirical perspective.

13:04.587 --> 13:06.106
When Owen was born,

13:06.130 --> 13:08.400
everyone said he was
such a beautiful baby,

13:08.424 --> 13:10.559
but I thought he
looked like a walnut.

13:11.761 --> 13:13.396
A crying walnut.

13:16.224 --> 13:18.369
She doesn't look like a
walnut at all, Ross.

13:18.393 --> 13:19.953
When do you get
to take her home?

13:19.977 --> 13:22.238
Excellent question. Kendra.

13:23.064 --> 13:24.625
When do I get to take her home?

13:24.649 --> 13:27.618
Well, checkout time is looking
like sometime tomorrow.

13:27.860 --> 13:30.297
So, are you any closer
to choosing a name?

13:30.321 --> 13:33.050
I thought I'd wait a little longer,
till I got to know her better.

13:33.074 --> 13:35.084
Have you thought about
naming her after someone?

13:35.118 --> 13:37.221
Yeah, like a famous
musician or something.

13:37.245 --> 13:40.131
Or a family member. What's
your mom's name, Ross?

13:40.415 --> 13:41.882
Mavis.

13:46.087 --> 13:47.388
Mavis?

13:49.173 --> 13:50.558
Bay!

13:51.884 --> 13:53.102
Bailey!

13:53.803 --> 13:55.781
You sure about this? Sure
you want to be here?

13:55.805 --> 13:56.782
Sure, I'm sure.

13:56.806 --> 13:59.034
Because, you know, we
could go someplace else.

13:59.058 --> 14:01.787
Someplace quieter,
where we could...

14:01.811 --> 14:03.696
Where we could, you know, talk.

14:03.855 --> 14:04.998
Don't want to talk.

14:05.022 --> 14:07.199
Want to drink. Want to dance.

14:07.358 --> 14:09.076
Want to dance?

14:10.319 --> 14:11.380
Later.

14:11.404 --> 14:12.673
Want a beer or something?

14:12.697 --> 14:13.882
Look, they'll card us.

14:13.906 --> 14:16.167
No, they won't. Not if
we got past the bouncer.

14:16.576 --> 14:17.803
Excuse me.

14:17.827 --> 14:20.097
Where'd she go? Excuse
me, could we get a...

14:20.121 --> 14:21.181
Look, let's just...

14:21.205 --> 14:23.883
We'll stay for the first set,
and then we'll split, okay?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.271
Look, if you're not up for a
good time, fine, but I am, okay?

14:27.295 --> 14:31.348
So if you're gonna be a drag, if you're gonna stand
around all night, looking like somebody died...

14:33.509 --> 14:36.238
Bailey, come on, let's
talk about it, man!

14:36.262 --> 14:37.698
What is there to talk about?

14:37.722 --> 14:38.939
You know!

14:39.307 --> 14:40.524
Her!

14:41.350 --> 14:42.777
Jill.

14:46.814 --> 14:47.750
Excuse me.

14:47.774 --> 14:49.992
Can I get a couple
of drafts, please?

14:50.109 --> 14:51.628
See?

14:51.652 --> 14:53.621
What did I tell you?
Piece of cake.

15:03.581 --> 15:04.799
Bailey?

15:09.837 --> 15:11.680
Hey, I want to talk to you both.

15:14.008 --> 15:18.145
I know this is going to seem like kind of
a weird time to bring this up, but, um...

15:19.472 --> 15:21.816
I was lying in bed this morning,

15:22.767 --> 15:24.985
and I was watching Kirsten...

15:26.187 --> 15:28.499
You know, get dressed and stuff.

15:28.523 --> 15:29.907
Should I be hearing this?

15:31.818 --> 15:33.577
It's G-rated. I promise.

15:33.903 --> 15:35.005
Okay.

15:35.029 --> 15:37.248
She's getting ready to go and,

15:38.574 --> 15:40.501
and I'm thinking...

15:41.494 --> 15:44.130
I'm thinking, "Don't
walk out that door.

15:45.915 --> 15:48.134
Don't go,

15:48.376 --> 15:52.888
because in here, in this room, everything
is just the way I want it to be,

15:53.840 --> 15:56.851
and out there, who knows?

15:57.176 --> 16:00.271
Even tomorrow, who knows?"

16:01.222 --> 16:05.151
And I thought, "What
am I waiting for?"

16:06.185 --> 16:07.862
You want to ask
her to marry you.

16:08.688 --> 16:09.947
Really?

16:10.690 --> 16:11.708
I just think...

16:11.732 --> 16:13.534
You don't have to
explain, Charlie.

16:14.110 --> 16:18.507
We understand, and you don't have
to ask our permission, either.

16:18.531 --> 16:20.374
No, I know.

16:20.658 --> 16:22.668
It's not that.

16:23.911 --> 16:26.547
I want to ask her in
kind of a special way.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.509
I want to give her Mom's ring...

16:31.836 --> 16:33.053
Oh.

16:33.379 --> 16:35.148
And I know it's not mine to give

16:35.172 --> 16:37.516
and I know I'll have
to ask Bay too,

16:38.384 --> 16:39.903
and I know that you guys
might want it someday.

16:39.927 --> 16:43.699
I mean, you have every right,
for when you get married.

16:43.723 --> 16:46.233
Well, I have no
immediate prospects.

16:47.935 --> 16:49.695
Right. Well...

16:50.605 --> 16:52.541
I could completely understand.

16:52.565 --> 16:54.251
I think you should do it.

16:54.275 --> 16:55.993
I think you should
give her the ring.

17:02.617 --> 17:04.501
Do it, Charlie.

17:06.579 --> 17:08.172
Thanks.

17:13.836 --> 17:16.356
So why'd you tell that
girl you'd call her, huh?

17:16.380 --> 17:17.983
I might call her.

17:18.007 --> 17:19.358
I will.

17:19.383 --> 17:20.643
I liked her.

17:21.093 --> 17:22.945
She was nice, and she was cute.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.281
Didn't you think she was cute?

17:24.305 --> 17:26.032
So this is how it's going to be?

17:26.057 --> 17:29.151
You're just going to go on like nothing
happened, clubbing, hitting on girls?

17:29.310 --> 17:32.414
What are you doing?
Give me the keys, Bay.

17:32.438 --> 17:33.457
Why?

17:33.481 --> 17:35.208
Why? Because you're drunk, that's why.
I'm driving.

17:35.232 --> 17:36.533
I am not drunk.

17:36.609 --> 17:38.160
Hey, I am not drunk.

17:38.277 --> 17:40.088
Fine. You're not drunk,

17:40.112 --> 17:42.132
you're not sad, you're not
angry, you're not anything,

17:42.156 --> 17:43.958
and you're not getting
behind the wheel.

17:47.787 --> 17:49.139
Give me the keys, Will.

17:49.163 --> 17:50.474
Will, give me...

17:50.498 --> 17:51.966
Give me the keys!

17:52.375 --> 17:53.550
Look...

18:04.595 --> 18:05.771
Bailey!

18:07.223 --> 18:09.316
Bailey!

18:20.987 --> 18:22.798
Bailey, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

18:22.822 --> 18:24.466
- What?
- Driving drunk?

18:24.490 --> 18:26.000
I am not...

18:27.326 --> 18:28.470
Did you tattle on me, man?

18:28.494 --> 18:30.222
You stupid, stupid
son of a bitch!

18:30.246 --> 18:31.765
What are you thinking about?

18:31.789 --> 18:36.019
Like every day in this house doesn't say to you,
you do not drink and then get behind the wheel.

18:36.043 --> 18:37.187
- Okay.
- Like you need to be told.

18:37.211 --> 18:40.180
Okay! Fine. You made your point.

18:42.425 --> 18:43.443
Thanks a lot.

18:43.467 --> 18:44.685
Come on, I was worried!

18:44.885 --> 18:46.905
Look, I know this is hard,

18:46.929 --> 18:49.898
I know you're going through some stuff,
but you don't have to do it alone.

18:51.726 --> 18:53.078
You just going to
shut everyone out?

18:53.102 --> 18:54.079
Yeah.

18:54.103 --> 18:55.372
Why? I don't get it.

18:55.396 --> 18:56.780
I'll tell you this, Bailey.

18:56.981 --> 18:58.583
I am not going to let
you self-destruct.

18:58.607 --> 19:00.326
I am not going to let
you kill yourself.

19:04.864 --> 19:06.040
That's funny.

19:06.741 --> 19:08.959
That... That is hysterical.
You know why?

19:09.285 --> 19:11.003
Because I said the same thing.

19:11.495 --> 19:13.672
The exact same thing,
and you know what?

19:14.749 --> 19:16.592
You can say it.

19:16.876 --> 19:18.635
And... And you can mean it.

19:18.753 --> 19:20.522
But the truth is,

19:20.546 --> 19:22.514
there is nothing,

19:22.798 --> 19:25.476
nothing that you
can do about it.

19:27.053 --> 19:28.437
They're just words.

19:29.055 --> 19:30.564
- Bailey...
- That's all they are.

19:31.932 --> 19:33.400
Just words.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.421
What?

19:55.498 --> 19:58.842
Uh, I saw you yesterday
at the, uh...

20:00.961 --> 20:02.930
Well, anyways, I
keep seeing you.

20:04.548 --> 20:06.266
How you doing? You okay?

20:08.135 --> 20:09.112
I... I knew her.

20:09.136 --> 20:11.855
Jill, because she and
my brother were...

20:13.265 --> 20:15.827
Anyways, I knew her, so I
thought that maybe, uh...

20:15.851 --> 20:17.027
What?

20:18.145 --> 20:20.864
I thought that maybe we
could talk or something.

20:22.691 --> 20:24.284
Or something?

20:24.860 --> 20:26.703
Well, I thought that
I could help you.

20:27.655 --> 20:29.331
What makes you
think I need help?

20:31.200 --> 20:32.668
She was your sister.

20:33.119 --> 20:34.628
So?

20:37.414 --> 20:41.552
So you understand what
I'm going through?

20:42.503 --> 20:43.762
Yes.

20:43.963 --> 20:45.472
You understand me?

20:47.424 --> 20:48.610
What I need?

20:48.634 --> 20:50.018
Well, I, uh...

20:51.887 --> 20:53.897
You know how to
make it all better?

20:54.598 --> 20:56.275
I, uh...

21:01.897 --> 21:03.949
You don't know anything.

21:13.617 --> 21:14.835
Hi.

21:15.161 --> 21:16.378
Okay.

21:16.495 --> 21:19.506
I found the infant seat,
and I also found this.

21:19.665 --> 21:22.009
A mobile, to hang over her crib,

21:22.376 --> 21:25.179
and a dog.

21:25.671 --> 21:27.347
Every child needs a dog.

21:27.548 --> 21:29.558
Take this one. Please.

21:31.260 --> 21:33.187
She's not coming
home with me today.

21:34.513 --> 21:35.731
What?

21:36.140 --> 21:38.317
And I have this feeling...

21:39.101 --> 21:41.028
I think they're going to
give her to someone else.

21:42.521 --> 21:43.989
I thought everything
was all set.

21:44.607 --> 21:48.202
I was going over some insurance
information with Kendra yesterday,

21:49.195 --> 21:51.089
and she asked me why
my medical records

21:51.113 --> 21:54.082
show I get an HIV test
every six months,

21:54.825 --> 21:57.294
so I told her, that I'm gay.

21:59.038 --> 22:00.422
She didn't know?

22:01.040 --> 22:02.674
I didn't put it on
my application.

22:04.585 --> 22:07.689
I know, I know, but I thought...

22:07.713 --> 22:09.848
I mean, it's hard enough

22:09.882 --> 22:13.560
to adopt a baby as a single
man but as a single gay man,

22:14.303 --> 22:16.355
I figured I didn't
stand a chance.

22:17.723 --> 22:22.945
So this morning, Kendra said there was
some last-minute confusion, some delay,

22:24.605 --> 22:26.406
but I think I know
what she's not saying.

22:31.487 --> 22:34.748
It has to work out,
because this...

22:35.240 --> 22:37.668
This is the only way it's
ever going to happen for me.

22:39.203 --> 22:40.754
I know.

22:43.624 --> 22:45.676
I want her to belong to me.

22:48.963 --> 22:51.942
And I want to belong to her,

22:51.966 --> 22:54.810
because all of a sudden, I mean,

22:55.344 --> 22:57.854
that seems like the whole
point, doesn't it?

23:02.142 --> 23:03.443
Yes.

23:05.980 --> 23:07.582
You know, I can't
find the receipt,

23:07.606 --> 23:10.701
so you'd better hope they'll give an
exchange without proof of purchase.

23:11.652 --> 23:14.506
I don't know why you're the
one that's pissed off,

23:14.530 --> 23:19.135
like I insulted you because I'd rather not
walk around looking like a bad lounge act.

23:19.159 --> 23:20.419
Hey.

23:20.536 --> 23:26.008
You know, I wouldn't go out, and without
any regards to your personal style,

23:26.250 --> 23:30.345
buy you, buy you something
like, like this.

23:33.173 --> 23:34.641
Although...

23:34.842 --> 23:36.518
What size do you wear again?

23:39.179 --> 23:41.481
Now, this... This is me.
This I like.

23:43.308 --> 23:44.619
What's going on with
these buttons here?

23:44.643 --> 23:46.320
The bottom ones don't
match the top ones.

23:46.812 --> 23:47.998
Barney.

23:48.022 --> 23:49.323
What?

23:49.940 --> 23:51.658
Nothing.

23:52.151 --> 23:53.785
Hey, Jule.

23:54.611 --> 23:57.914
What are you looking over there for?
I already have a jacket.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.225
- Charlie.
- Hmm?

24:18.427 --> 24:19.728
Will you barry me?

24:20.846 --> 24:22.574
- Will I bury you?
- No.

24:22.598 --> 24:24.066
I don't know.

24:24.391 --> 24:26.411
- Do we have to decide that right now?
- Charlie...

24:26.435 --> 24:28.997
I suppose if anything
ever happened to you,

24:29.021 --> 24:31.958
God forbid, and you
wanted to be buried...

24:31.982 --> 24:34.701
I said, "Will you barry me?"
I want to be barried to you.

24:35.069 --> 24:36.953
Barry, not bury.

24:37.404 --> 24:38.423
Oh.

24:38.447 --> 24:40.957
My God, this is not how
I wanted this to go.

24:41.992 --> 24:43.752
You're asking me to marry you?

24:44.203 --> 24:45.962
This is the way I figure it.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.932
I love you,

24:47.956 --> 24:53.387
so obviously, I want to make a
commitment to you forever, because...

24:53.796 --> 24:55.273
Well, what are we waiting for?

24:55.297 --> 24:59.309
I mean, when you have now exactly
what you want, why wait?

24:59.510 --> 25:01.686
Things only go away.

25:02.638 --> 25:06.316
And I want to hold on to
everything that matters to me,

25:07.434 --> 25:09.569
and that means you, Charlie.

25:13.607 --> 25:15.742
Well, I was moved
by that argument.

25:18.904 --> 25:19.923
Charlie.

25:19.947 --> 25:21.049
I wanted to ask you.

25:21.073 --> 25:22.175
What?

25:22.199 --> 25:24.636
I'm supposed to ask you.

25:24.660 --> 25:25.877
Damn.

25:26.745 --> 25:28.181
Damn. I was getting all ready...

25:28.205 --> 25:30.257
For God's sakes,
does that mean yes?

25:30.457 --> 25:32.676
Is that what you're saying? Yes?

25:32.709 --> 25:34.553
Yes! Okay?

25:34.586 --> 25:35.804
Yes.

25:36.547 --> 25:38.098
Yes.

25:44.429 --> 25:46.731
I will definitely barry you.

25:50.435 --> 25:51.987
Griffin.

25:52.104 --> 25:53.414
Man, you don't learn.

25:53.438 --> 25:54.374
I want to talk to you.

25:54.398 --> 25:55.699
What is your problem?

25:56.066 --> 25:58.618
I don't want anything
from you, okay?

25:58.777 --> 26:01.256
So just get out of here.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.423
Stop following me around.

26:02.447 --> 26:04.416
No, please. I, uh...

26:04.616 --> 26:06.460
I have this coat for you.

26:08.162 --> 26:09.713
What? A coat?

26:10.747 --> 26:12.466
You're giving me a coat?

26:12.499 --> 26:13.476
You don't understand.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.885
Get the hell out of here!

26:15.043 --> 26:16.344
Do you understand that?

26:17.212 --> 26:21.558
I don't want you
talking to me, or...

26:22.092 --> 26:23.602
...or following me around.

26:24.595 --> 26:27.230
I don't need you to
feel sorry for me,

26:28.223 --> 26:30.410
and I don't need your damn coat!

26:30.434 --> 26:31.943
It's from Jill.

26:32.519 --> 26:36.072
She told me about leaving
your coat in LA,

26:37.566 --> 26:39.826
so you see, this...

26:41.069 --> 26:44.581
This stupid old thing... She
was going to buy it for you.

26:45.115 --> 26:47.552
She was planning
to give it to you

26:47.576 --> 26:49.377
to replace the one
that she lost.

26:52.664 --> 26:54.758
That's what she told me,

26:56.418 --> 26:59.105
only she never got around to it,

26:59.129 --> 27:01.765
so I just thought maybe...

27:01.965 --> 27:03.350
Go away.

27:17.981 --> 27:20.158
I know what it's like...

27:22.694 --> 27:24.788
To lose someone.

27:25.989 --> 27:27.675
I mean...

27:27.699 --> 27:29.709
I know how that feels.

27:32.079 --> 27:33.922
And I'm sorry.

27:37.042 --> 27:39.219
It's just, you look so cold.

27:41.046 --> 27:43.807
And I thought you
should have this.

27:59.314 --> 28:00.740
Hey.

28:02.150 --> 28:04.077
Something you want?

28:06.488 --> 28:07.998
Nah.

28:10.242 --> 28:12.752
You haven't talked
to anybody all day.

28:14.413 --> 28:15.880
No?

28:17.291 --> 28:19.009
Hmm.

28:21.795 --> 28:24.556
Oh, listen, uh, this is, um,

28:25.507 --> 28:29.487
I just thought this
was really something.

28:29.511 --> 28:31.354
Jill's Mom called.

28:31.471 --> 28:32.939
You were out.

28:33.473 --> 28:36.035
She, uh, asked if maybe
you could stop by.

28:36.059 --> 28:38.069
Forget it.

28:38.103 --> 28:39.446
Forget it.

28:40.564 --> 28:42.365
You don't want
anything from anybody.

28:42.899 --> 28:44.784
Pretty much.

28:45.527 --> 28:47.297
Can we talk about that?

28:47.321 --> 28:48.872
No.

28:58.457 --> 29:00.675
The thing is, Bay, we...

29:01.627 --> 29:04.512
Kind of get through
this stuff together.

29:05.505 --> 29:07.817
No one gets through
stuff together.

29:07.841 --> 29:09.559
You get through
everything alone.

29:09.926 --> 29:11.770
Come on.

29:11.928 --> 29:14.147
She was alone,

29:14.806 --> 29:17.734
and not just at the end.
The whole time.

29:20.103 --> 29:24.157
She couldn't ask for help, I couldn't
give her help, and that's the way it is.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.243
No, it isn't.

29:28.445 --> 29:29.663
Come on, Bay.

29:30.155 --> 29:32.967
Get away. Get away!
Get away from me!

29:32.991 --> 29:34.177
Bailey, I care about you.

29:34.201 --> 29:35.669
Don't.

29:35.702 --> 29:37.305
I don't want you to
care about me, okay?

29:37.329 --> 29:39.974
I don't want anyone
to care about me.

29:39.998 --> 29:42.717
Why? What is going on, Bay?

29:42.876 --> 29:44.771
Are you, like, blaming yourself?

29:44.795 --> 29:46.814
Is this about feeling like
it's your fault or something?

29:46.838 --> 29:47.982
No.

29:48.006 --> 29:50.016
No. You don't understand.

29:52.010 --> 29:53.603
I made a mistake,

29:54.179 --> 29:58.826
and, and I swear to God, I am
not going to make it again.

29:58.850 --> 29:59.827
What?

29:59.851 --> 30:03.247
I am not going to feel that
way about anyone anymore.

30:03.271 --> 30:06.292
I am not going to
love anyone anymore.

30:06.316 --> 30:08.034
- Bailey...
- I can't.

30:09.403 --> 30:10.912
I can't.

30:10.946 --> 30:13.248
Please. It's too hard.

30:14.074 --> 30:16.260
It's too hard, and
it hurts too much,

30:16.284 --> 30:18.638
so I don't want to love anyone,

30:18.662 --> 30:20.714
and I don't want
anyone to love me.

30:21.832 --> 30:23.508
Well, that's too bad.

30:24.376 --> 30:25.478
Charlie...

30:25.502 --> 30:26.771
You don't have a choice.

30:26.795 --> 30:28.263
No!

30:28.463 --> 30:29.899
Because I love you, Bay.

30:29.923 --> 30:31.599
Please, Charlie...

30:39.891 --> 30:41.776
I love you.

30:43.770 --> 30:45.363
I love you, man.

30:53.488 --> 30:55.749
They're saying there may
have been a mix-up,

30:57.409 --> 31:00.295
that a couple may have been
ahead of me on the list.

31:01.079 --> 31:02.640
But I think...

31:02.664 --> 31:07.218
Know it's because they've
reconsidered my fitness as a parent.

31:09.004 --> 31:10.764
I'm sure it's not that.

31:12.007 --> 31:13.767
I mean, how could it be that?

31:15.260 --> 31:17.488
You would make an
incredible father.

31:17.512 --> 31:19.741
I mean, you never yell.

31:19.765 --> 31:21.242
Never.

31:21.266 --> 31:22.785
And you never do that
thing parents do

31:22.809 --> 31:24.694
when they're supposed
to be listening to you,

31:25.270 --> 31:28.323
but really they're just noticing
you've got a lot of wax in your ears.

31:28.482 --> 31:29.949
It's not going to happen, Claud.

31:31.568 --> 31:32.879
No?

31:32.903 --> 31:34.621
And I don't know what to do.

31:36.907 --> 31:40.543
See, I... I made this
horrible mistake.

31:41.745 --> 31:45.048
I did something so
incredibly stupid.

31:47.125 --> 31:48.885
I fell in love with her.

31:51.838 --> 31:56.893
I held her for, like, a
total of maybe three hours,

31:58.303 --> 32:00.271
but I fell in love with her.

32:11.733 --> 32:13.868
I'll talk to you
in a minute, okay?

32:18.615 --> 32:19.833
Hey.

32:20.992 --> 32:22.585
Hey.

32:23.912 --> 32:25.421
Looks good on you.

32:28.750 --> 32:31.970
Did you find the little
ticket stub in the pocket?

32:32.587 --> 32:34.139
Yeah.

32:37.843 --> 32:40.395
A boat trip to Point Reyes.

32:41.179 --> 32:44.440
I was thinking the guy
who owned that coat,

32:45.058 --> 32:49.529
took his girlfriend there, and
they spent the whole day,

32:50.647 --> 32:53.992
and that was probably the
day they fell in love,

32:57.529 --> 32:59.747
and these little,
white stains...

33:00.574 --> 33:02.417
I bet he had a baby,

33:03.076 --> 33:07.005
and even though he was
probably a pretty tough guy,

33:08.206 --> 33:10.935
he would hold his little
girl's head right here,

33:10.959 --> 33:13.511
and she would let out
little milk burps.

33:16.089 --> 33:17.891
And this stain?

33:18.341 --> 33:21.153
Red wine from some
big celebration.

33:21.177 --> 33:22.488
He...

33:22.512 --> 33:25.064
He won 500 bucks in the lottery.

33:27.017 --> 33:27.994
Right.

33:28.018 --> 33:30.528
Or, uh, his horse came in.

33:32.355 --> 33:33.907
Right.

33:37.235 --> 33:41.206
Wonderful things happened to
the people who own that coat.

33:43.575 --> 33:46.044
Wonderful things
happen all the time.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.180
Miss Erhardt?

33:57.255 --> 33:59.525
Hi. Your office said I could
probably find you out here.

33:59.549 --> 34:02.194
I'm Bailey Salinger. I'm
a friend of Ross'...

34:02.218 --> 34:03.696
I see.

34:03.720 --> 34:06.407
And I've known Ross for
a really long time,

34:06.431 --> 34:09.493
so I thought I'd come down here

34:09.516 --> 34:10.828
and tell you some
things about him.

34:10.851 --> 34:11.829
Well, I'm not sure...

34:11.853 --> 34:16.074
He teaches my sister,
Claudia, the violin.

34:16.815 --> 34:19.953
He's her teacher, but actually,

34:21.196 --> 34:23.716
actually, he's, he's
kind of more than that.

34:23.739 --> 34:26.501
He cares for her,

34:26.701 --> 34:29.096
and he's there for her
when she makes mistakes,

34:29.120 --> 34:30.838
and I think,

34:31.915 --> 34:34.717
I think he loves her no
matter what she does,

34:35.793 --> 34:39.013
you know, without question,

34:40.090 --> 34:43.652
which is kind of what a parent
is, I think, so, so at least...

34:43.677 --> 34:44.695
Mr. Salinger...

34:44.719 --> 34:48.356
At least you could come down
and watch him with my sister

34:48.889 --> 34:52.161
before you decide that he has
no business being a parent.

34:52.185 --> 34:53.829
Look, I appreciate your concern.

34:53.853 --> 34:56.666
There are some administrative
problems that we have to work out.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.199
Yeah, I know.

34:58.274 --> 35:01.244
Administrative problems that have something
to do with the fact that he's gay.

35:01.277 --> 35:04.372
Nothing had been decided
one way or the other.

35:04.406 --> 35:09.085
He really, really
loves this baby,

35:10.245 --> 35:13.182
so how can you say that
that isn't good enough?

35:13.206 --> 35:15.717
How does being gay
matter at all?

35:18.837 --> 35:23.266
I mean, if someone
is actually willing

35:23.967 --> 35:28.313
to love someone else, that
is not so easy to do.

35:29.848 --> 35:32.493
It's so hard,

35:32.517 --> 35:34.819
and, and it doesn't
happen that often.

35:38.064 --> 35:40.033
So...

35:52.620 --> 35:53.796
Where you been?

35:55.123 --> 35:56.299
What are you doing?

35:56.750 --> 35:58.051
You remember this?

35:59.210 --> 36:00.386
Mother's Day?

36:01.421 --> 36:04.015
So, what, you thinking
about accessorizing?

36:07.969 --> 36:11.064
About proposing? Are you going
to propose to her, Charlie?

36:12.849 --> 36:14.734
Actually, she beat me to it.

36:16.186 --> 36:17.779
Really?

36:18.438 --> 36:19.822
No kidding?

36:21.566 --> 36:22.825
So...

36:23.985 --> 36:25.411
So...

36:25.695 --> 36:27.330
Yeah.

36:27.655 --> 36:29.832
I think so. I think
we're going to do it.

36:32.327 --> 36:33.920
I love her.

36:36.706 --> 36:38.591
I know you do.

36:45.757 --> 36:47.058
So, good.

36:47.550 --> 36:48.611
Really?

36:48.635 --> 36:50.196
Yeah.

36:50.220 --> 36:51.813
It feels...

36:53.598 --> 36:55.650
I don't know.

36:55.934 --> 36:57.443
Right.

37:01.606 --> 37:03.282
I bet it'll fit her.

37:09.781 --> 37:10.966
Do you need help with this?

37:10.990 --> 37:12.458
No, thanks.

37:13.243 --> 37:14.929
Hey, your windbreaker.

37:14.953 --> 37:16.722
Yeah, my windbreaker.

37:16.746 --> 37:18.673
Nice, huh?

37:18.706 --> 37:20.466
Hey, look what else I got.

37:22.001 --> 37:24.137
Picked it up with
my store credit.

37:26.089 --> 37:28.724
I know, it's not
your style, right?

37:30.093 --> 37:33.062
Well, what can I do, you know?
It's who I am.

37:34.013 --> 37:38.359
So, I, uh, guess you're probably going to
start looking at other guys now, right?

37:39.310 --> 37:44.240
I mean, cooler guys, guys
who have t-shirts and jeans

37:45.108 --> 37:46.951
and cigarettes rolled
up in their sleeves.

37:47.652 --> 37:49.745
Guys with, uh, tattoos.

37:51.072 --> 37:52.457
Guys with taste.

37:54.993 --> 37:58.004
What? I mean, uh, you hate it.

38:01.332 --> 38:02.884
I like it.

38:06.462 --> 38:08.014
You do hate it.

38:10.550 --> 38:12.268
Say something.

38:15.471 --> 38:17.773
You have the most
beautiful brown eyes.

38:20.226 --> 38:21.527
Do you know that?

38:35.158 --> 38:37.001
I want to give you this.

38:43.208 --> 38:45.811
It's my Mom's ring.

38:45.835 --> 38:48.221
The diamond ring that my
father gave my mother,

38:49.172 --> 38:51.891
God, 26 years ago.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.728
The others want you
to have it too.

38:57.555 --> 38:59.023
And I love you.

39:03.186 --> 39:04.612
So, open it.

39:05.563 --> 39:07.291
Oh, Charlie...

39:07.315 --> 39:08.741
Go on.

39:23.373 --> 39:24.632
Huh...

39:24.749 --> 39:26.268
What?

39:26.292 --> 39:27.728
Is there...

39:27.752 --> 39:31.264
Don't take this the wrong way, but
is there an actual stone in there?

39:32.257 --> 39:33.516
Let me see.

39:36.970 --> 39:38.197
Mom wasn't big into jewelry,

39:38.221 --> 39:41.315
and Dad was kind
of a cheapskate.

39:42.517 --> 39:44.026
I see.

39:44.352 --> 39:46.821
I guess it has...

39:47.397 --> 39:48.823
Sentimental value.

39:50.024 --> 39:51.993
That'd be about the size of it.

40:07.917 --> 40:09.719
Here's what I don't get.

40:11.838 --> 40:13.848
She was so insecure, you know?

40:14.757 --> 40:18.988
So what made her so,
like, so arrogant

40:19.012 --> 40:21.865
that she thought she could go
back to it just one more time,

40:21.889 --> 40:23.357
and it would be okay?

40:24.767 --> 40:26.360
I don't know, man.

40:27.687 --> 40:28.789
I don't know.

40:28.813 --> 40:30.114
Yeah.

40:33.192 --> 40:34.827
I hate her for it.

40:36.321 --> 40:38.039
I want to scream at her.

40:41.451 --> 40:44.513
She's, like, dead, and I
want to scream at her.

40:44.537 --> 40:45.963
Don't you?

40:47.623 --> 40:49.175
Sometimes.

40:51.836 --> 40:54.096
Sometimes I just want
to touch her again.

41:10.355 --> 41:12.615
She made a mistake, Griffin.

41:15.693 --> 41:18.412
I keep trying to make it
mean more, but it doesn't.

41:20.531 --> 41:22.708
She just made a mistake.

41:33.086 --> 41:34.470
Tess.

41:35.296 --> 41:36.982
Tess. You know, she
really looks like a Tess.

41:37.006 --> 41:38.233
Yeah, she does, doesn't she?

41:38.257 --> 41:41.310
Have you noticed Owen drools over
mashed yams and pretty girls?

41:41.386 --> 41:42.446
I think he's in love.

41:42.470 --> 41:45.314
Yeah, well, wait in line, pal.
I was here first.

41:45.473 --> 41:48.359
FYI, Ross, I happen to be
an excellent babysitter.

41:48.434 --> 41:49.735
Okay.

41:49.977 --> 41:53.040
Here we go. I chose
my private stock.

41:53.064 --> 41:54.875
Well, shouldn't we
wait for Bailey?

41:54.899 --> 41:56.293
He said he wasn't
coming tonight.

41:56.317 --> 42:00.996
Oh, really? I wanted him
to meet my daughter.

42:02.532 --> 42:06.261
God, that sounds so weird.
My daughter.

42:06.285 --> 42:08.347
You know, by the time
Charlie plans this wedding,

42:08.371 --> 42:10.307
your daughter will be old
enough to be a flower girl.

42:10.331 --> 42:12.935
Yeah, or play Pachelbel
at the ceremony.

42:12.959 --> 42:14.260
Oh, could I see the ring?

42:14.460 --> 42:16.647
Or perform the ceremony.

42:16.671 --> 42:18.347
Hey, whose side are you on?

42:19.257 --> 42:21.559
Okay, Claud, two sips.
That's it.

42:25.638 --> 42:27.148
Hey.

42:28.391 --> 42:30.025
Bay, I thought...

42:31.477 --> 42:32.820
We were just, um...

42:34.689 --> 42:35.958
Celebrating.

42:35.982 --> 42:37.491
It's okay.

42:41.320 --> 42:43.122
Is this...

42:43.614 --> 42:45.082
Is this her?

42:45.575 --> 42:47.334
She's mine.

42:49.203 --> 42:50.546
Thank you.

42:51.330 --> 42:52.349
Well, what'd he do?

42:52.373 --> 42:54.008
- He, uh...
- Nothing.

42:54.750 --> 42:57.178
Really, Ross, I
didn't do anything.

42:57.462 --> 42:59.764
I'm sure it wasn't what
made the difference.

43:00.173 --> 43:03.476
Maybe not, but maybe.

43:05.470 --> 43:10.941
Do you think, maybe,
um, could I hold her?

43:14.353 --> 43:15.696
Sure.

43:20.985 --> 43:22.045
There you go.

43:22.069 --> 43:25.748
Yeah, I got her. I got her.

43:44.091 --> 43:45.861
So is somebody going to
make a toast, or what?

43:45.885 --> 43:46.820
Charlie?

43:46.844 --> 43:48.071
I suck at toasts.

43:48.095 --> 43:49.531
Well, you'd better
start practicing.

43:49.555 --> 43:52.858
Just for the record, I am not gonna wear one
of those poufy chiffon bridesmaids' dresses.

43:53.893 --> 43:55.653
We weren't planning on
inviting you anyway.

43:59.190 --> 44:01.460
I thought the best man was
supposed to make the toast.

44:01.484 --> 44:03.212
Okay, Bay. Dress rehearsal.

44:03.236 --> 44:05.255
Uh, all right. A toast.

44:05.279 --> 44:10.459
A toast to Joe for taking that
crappy manicotti off the menu.
