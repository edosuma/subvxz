00:39.664 --> 00:41.416
911. What is your emergency?

00:41.499 --> 00:43.126
911. What is your emergency?

00:43.209 --> 00:45.253
<i>Goddamn menace, I'm telling you.</i>

00:45.336 --> 00:47.047
Hey, Patti. You're up late.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.716
<i>That trash panda's been</i>
<i>tearin' up the neighborhood.</i>

00:49.799 --> 00:51.926
<i>At it again.</i>
<i>It's been going on for months.</i>

00:52.010 --> 00:54.345
Slow down, Patti.
You say the raccoon is where?

00:54.429 --> 00:55.764
<i>My neighbor's trash.</i>

00:55.847 --> 00:58.058
<i>I'm tellin' you,</i>
<i>I'm gonna sue 'em blind, Andy.</i>

00:58.141 --> 00:58.975
<i>I called you before.</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:02.353
<i>They dump their cans on my property,</i>
<i>and that bandit just goes wild.</i>

01:02.437 --> 01:04.647
- Maybe it has low blood sugar.
<i>- What?</i>

01:04.731 --> 01:06.983
Does the animal show any signs of rabies?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.027
<i>Are you a cat or a dog person?</i>

01:09.110 --> 01:11.362
I'm Switzerland, Patti. What can I say?

01:11.446 --> 01:13.531
<i>Did I tell you they're raisin' pits there?</i>

01:13.615 --> 01:14.783
<i>Gotta be dozens of 'em.</i>

01:14.866 --> 01:17.243
<i>Don't you need a license</i>
<i>to own those things?</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:19.204
<i>I mean, they maul babies and shit.</i>

01:20.288 --> 01:22.749
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

01:22.832 --> 01:24.501
<i>Goddamn government.</i>

01:26.461 --> 01:27.921
Shit.

03:19.782 --> 03:20.617
Shit.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.847
Good morning. How can I help you?

04:25.556 --> 04:26.516
Lost it.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.559
I'm sorry?

04:31.437 --> 04:32.438
Phone.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.692
- It fell.

04:35.775 --> 04:39.320
It fell in… It fell in… Fuck.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.405
You lost your phone?

04:40.488 --> 04:42.490
Yeah. Yeah, it fell… It…

04:43.574 --> 04:44.867
It fell…

04:47.453 --> 04:49.497
Jesus. Fuck! Fuck!

04:49.580 --> 04:51.040
You're okay, you're okay.

04:52.750 --> 04:56.004
One month ago, Sergeant,
you couldn't find the word for phone.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.463
I'd say that's progress.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.092
I know it's hard.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.428
You just want to feel like your old self.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.472
Okay, take a breath.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.390
Come on.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.852
- And let it go.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.272
You're okay.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.648
You're good.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.150
- Let's do it again.
- Okay.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.834
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Mom.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.544
Happy birthday!

05:36.627 --> 05:38.254
Oh, it's a big one.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.714
- Thirty.
- Yeah, don't remind me.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.551
How was your shift?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.262
Same old, same old.

05:47.805 --> 05:48.890
Still up for lunch?

05:51.225 --> 05:52.060
Sure.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.103
You wanna change or…

05:54.937 --> 05:55.772
Nope.

06:06.491 --> 06:09.869
If you're bored at work,
find something else that interests you.

06:09.952 --> 06:10.787
Mom.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.580
I'm trying to say you need a plan.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.416
If you wanna go back to school,
don't wait another year.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.251
You've already missed the fall deadline.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.878
It's just more student loans.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.922
Yeah, but at least you'd have a degree.

06:21.005 --> 06:21.839
Are you done?

06:23.633 --> 06:24.759
You don't seem happy.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.678
God, if I knew you were gonna
ambush me with the talk--

06:27.762 --> 06:29.806
- No, I'm just trying to help.
- Well, stop.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.143
Look, I'm sorry I don't know
what I wanna do with my life.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.270
We can't all be
free of self-doubt like you.

06:36.854 --> 06:37.688
Andy.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.191
You've always known what you wanted to do.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.402
You're good at helping people,
and I'm not.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.571
Maybe Dad was the fuck-up.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.574
I get it from someone.

06:49.450 --> 06:52.703
Jerry was smart and funny,
and he adored you.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.998
Yeah, you tell me that,
but I can't remember anything about him.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.837
Sometimes I just wish he were here.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.298
You know, I think you've
gotten used to feeling low.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.677
You know what they say?
You can't fall off the floor.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.096
- Ever heard of basements?
- Basements have floors.

07:10.179 --> 07:11.264
That's the ground.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.474
Mmm, ground is just
another word for floor.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.143
Ground is like six feet under.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.397
You want to talk to someone?

07:19.480 --> 07:20.898
'Cause this has been so fun?

07:20.982 --> 07:22.942
- I mean a therapist.
- Mom.

07:23.025 --> 07:25.445
What? I can cover it.
This check… it's for you.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.239
- It's for something exciting and fun.
- I'm fine.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.365
Are you?

07:29.448 --> 07:31.951
It's hard to eat and reassure you
at the same time.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.661
I just want you to decide.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.830
You sure you don't want to decide for me?

07:37.415 --> 07:40.001
Hey, do you know that guy?
He keeps looking at you.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.630
I'm the only person here under 60?

07:44.714 --> 07:47.049
I'm not that old.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.720
I know you didn't want to come home.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.180
It's my fault you're here.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.558
Mom. You were sick.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.605
You could go back to New York.
You were meeting people--

08:00.688 --> 08:02.106
To my three part-time jobs?

08:02.190 --> 08:04.567
Will you think about talking to someone?

08:04.650 --> 08:06.319
Why? You've already diagnosed me.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.236
Stop it.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.741
I love you.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.700
Laura?

08:12.783 --> 08:14.994
You are brilliant and beautiful.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.871
And, I know you will find your way.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.332
I can't believe we didn't see you.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.584
Betsy, hi. How are you?
You know my daughter, Andy.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.295
How you doing, honey? This is Shelly.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.296
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.215
You really are a miracle-worker.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.467
- My father's doing so much better.
- Good.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.802
I've even had time
to get Shelly ready to go.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.679
- Med school, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.723
- Yeah, congratulations.
- Thank you.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.058
Yeah, excuse me.

08:37.141 --> 08:40.019
Shelly is thinking pediatric oncology.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.605
I know it's early,
but it's never too early.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.026
That's amazing.

08:47.109 --> 08:49.153
- Yeah, I know.
- Shelly?

08:50.279 --> 08:52.073
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

08:59.705 --> 09:00.665
Run, Andy!

09:03.584 --> 09:04.627
Andy, get down!

09:24.855 --> 09:25.856
Go.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.292
<i>Sorry, I didn't understand.</i>

09:44.375 --> 09:46.043
<i>Did you say, "trouble"?</i>

09:46.127 --> 09:47.378
<i>How can I help you?</i>

10:05.813 --> 10:06.814
Get up, pig.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.318
Get up!

10:12.403 --> 10:13.696
Do your job!

10:16.073 --> 10:18.117
Where's your fucking gun?

10:29.920 --> 10:30.921
She, uh…

10:31.839 --> 10:33.299
She doesn't have a gun.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.344
She's not a cop.

10:38.346 --> 10:42.808
She just works for them,
answering phones, so…

10:45.061 --> 10:46.687
You can go now.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.817
You fucking fake useless bitch!

10:51.901 --> 10:52.735
Wait!

10:54.904 --> 10:55.738
Shoot me.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.834
Andy, go! Go, Andy, go!

11:08.918 --> 11:11.379
- Go get help!
- Fuck you!

11:47.581 --> 11:50.126
- <i>15 Baker 22…</i>

11:51.544 --> 11:53.629
Mom. Are you with me?

11:55.339 --> 11:56.590
I'm cold.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.303
Is it snowing?

12:03.806 --> 12:04.723
No.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.897
Oh, he's coming back.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.191
Hey, you're safe.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.820
Mom? Mom?

12:17.903 --> 12:18.988
You okay?

12:19.071 --> 12:22.575
Uh, 52-year-old female,
stab wound to the left hand.

12:22.658 --> 12:23.993
Declining LOC.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.163
Andy?

12:28.789 --> 12:30.124
Don't talk to them.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.792
Who?

12:33.085 --> 12:34.295
The police.

12:38.799 --> 12:39.633
Andy.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.179
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.351
Hey.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.359
Mom's still in the ER.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.403
Yeah, I saw her on the way in.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.157
They're just waiting on a plastic surgeon.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.409
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Hmm.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.889
Can you feel me touching your fingers?

13:28.224 --> 13:29.183
Barely.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.061
Surgeon's on her way up.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.479
Thank you.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.789
<i>The shooter, a white male</i>
<i>in his twenties is now dead.</i>

13:51.872 --> 13:53.374
Hey, you're famous.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.918
<i>…who used his own weapon against him.</i>

13:56.001 --> 13:59.421
<i>While the police have not yet identified</i>
<i>the woman, locals say she is Laura Oliver,</i>

13:59.505 --> 14:03.133
<i>a speech language pathologist</i>
<i>and long-time resident of Belle Isle.</i>

14:03.217 --> 14:05.970
<i>A clinician at Savannah's</i>
<i>Veterans' Affairs Center,</i>

14:06.053 --> 14:10.432
<i>Oliver was injured during the struggle</i>
<i>and is being treated at this hospital.</i>

14:10.516 --> 14:12.977
<i>Eyewitnesses praised Oliver</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

14:13.060 --> 14:14.937
<i>saying she likely saved many lives.</i>

14:15.020 --> 14:17.815
<i>The incident shocked residents</i>
<i>of this quiet community</i>

14:17.898 --> 14:19.650
<i>which has the lowest crime rate…</i>

14:21.235 --> 14:22.945
Andy, you should go home.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.115
I'm okay.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.825
Andrea, you can barely stand up.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.369
I'll call you as soon as
she's out of surgery.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.329
Mom wasn't making any sense. She…

14:34.081 --> 14:37.209
She thought it was snowing,
and she told me not to talk to--

14:37.293 --> 14:39.169
- What did she say to you?

14:39.253 --> 14:40.087
Andrea Oliver?

14:41.088 --> 14:42.590
I'm Detective Sergeant Wilson.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.841
This is Detective Shooltz.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.050
Savannah Police Department.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.595
We're assisting Belle Isle
with the investigation.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.388
If we could have a word in private?

14:49.471 --> 14:50.556
It's not a good time.

14:50.639 --> 14:51.765
And you are?

14:52.766 --> 14:54.894
Andy's stepfather, Gordon Oliver.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.812
And how's your wife doing?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.647
Ex-wife. She's managing, thank you.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.941
Ms. Oliver, if you could
take us through it.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.484
Just tell us what happened.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.029
Um…

15:05.905 --> 15:06.822
You okay?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.116
She…
She's, you know, been up all night.

15:09.199 --> 15:12.202
- Then this happens. Obviously, she's--
- Of course, I understand.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.663
Look, how about I tell you what we know?

15:14.747 --> 15:16.582
You see if you have anything to add.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.667
Want to sit down?

15:30.971 --> 15:32.723
Did you recognize the shooter?

15:34.683 --> 15:35.517
Uh, no.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.522
Name's Jonah Helsinger. 25 years old.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.359
Apparently the young woman
who was shot, Shelly Bernard,

15:43.442 --> 15:46.528
she broke up with him three weeks ago.
He didn't take it well.

15:47.071 --> 15:47.905
Christ.

15:47.988 --> 15:53.035
I, uh… gather from witnesses
that Helsinger expected you to kill him.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.831
He saw your uniform,
figured on suicide by cop.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.125
But, since you weren't armed…

16:02.878 --> 16:05.464
That was something, what your mom did.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.342
She serve in the military?

16:11.303 --> 16:13.514
You see the video?

16:15.349 --> 16:19.770
Someone decided it was more important
to record the shooting than text 911.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.608
- <i>Go, run! Get help! Andy, go!</i>
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

16:25.776 --> 16:28.404
When she used the knife,
what was your mother saying?

16:29.446 --> 16:30.322
Andy?

16:31.949 --> 16:34.702
Mom! Are you okay?
You were in there forever.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.328
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.374
Ms. Oliver,
I'm Detective Sergeant Wilson--

16:40.457 --> 16:41.792
I'm sorry, I don't think--

16:41.875 --> 16:43.210
We just need ten minutes.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.003
No, I'm… very tired.

16:45.087 --> 16:48.007
I'll have my office call
and schedule an appointment, okay?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.093
Sure.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.471
- Take care.
- You, too.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.727
Let's get you back to your room.

16:59.810 --> 17:00.811
I'm going home.

17:02.021 --> 17:02.855
Laura?

17:03.814 --> 17:06.817
- But you just got out of surgery.
- I hate hospitals, Gordon.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.652
Dad, she wants to go home.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.695
All right.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.907
Will you bring the car out back?
There's a bunch of press out front.

17:13.991 --> 17:14.867
Okay.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.708
What did you say to them?

17:23.751 --> 17:26.545
Nothing. They…
They just wanted to know what happened.

17:27.796 --> 17:31.467
- I don't like all this attention.
- Yeah, let's get you out of here.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.385
No. We can't do this.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.304
You're not taking care of me again.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.347
I know, we'll figure it out.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.058
You should never have come back.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.392
Mom, it's okay.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.854
Dwayne? Dwayne,
can I please get my things?

17:43.937 --> 17:44.772
Sure.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.859
You go meet Gordon.
I'll be there in a minute.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.323
Andy? Can you do that?

17:56.325 --> 17:57.159
Yeah.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.545
- Can you believe this?
- Amazing.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.422
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, though.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.382
I just don't believe it.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.927
<i>No wonder this thing is going viral.</i>

18:15.010 --> 18:17.846
<i>You watch this woman,</i>
<i>and you just can't…</i>

18:40.494 --> 18:41.328
Thanks, Dwayne.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.705
All right. All set.

18:44.873 --> 18:45.707
Thank you.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.297
What, uh, meds did they give you?

18:52.881 --> 18:54.299
You can stay at Gordon's.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.010
What?

18:57.094 --> 18:58.470
At least for tonight.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.806
I'm not leaving you alone.

19:00.889 --> 19:04.184
Look, we've…
We've put this off long enough.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.185
Put what off?

19:08.939 --> 19:10.190
You need to move out.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.610
You're getting way ahead of yourself.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.113
No, you're not listening to me.
I'm serious.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.867
Sorry, could we talk about this later?

19:19.950 --> 19:21.577
No, you need to start your life,

19:21.660 --> 19:23.453
- whatever that looks like.
- I get it.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.622
And I want you
out of the house tonight. Just…

19:25.706 --> 19:27.833
I'm sorry,
but that sounds a little crazy.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.585
I don't care what it sounds like.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.381
Why are you doing this?

19:35.048 --> 19:36.925
- Is it 'cause I didn't--
- Because you…

19:38.427 --> 19:39.928
- What?
- You're an adult!

19:40.512 --> 19:42.306
So, start acting like one.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.945
- These go down there?
- Yeah.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.949
She'll be here any minute.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.493
Yes, we have the footage of her leaving.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.258
<i>Little is known about Laura Oliver,</i>

20:59.341 --> 21:02.302
<i>the Georgia woman whose heroism</i>
<i>stopped what might have been</i>

21:02.386 --> 21:04.346
<i>an even deadlier rampage earlier today.</i>

21:04.930 --> 21:07.391
<i>Neighbors say</i>
<i>Oliver is a dedicated healer,</i>

21:07.474 --> 21:10.602
<i>who's worked for several decades</i>
<i>at Savannah's Veterans' Center</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:12.771
<i>and is active in local charities.</i>

21:12.854 --> 21:16.525
<i>The video of her extraordinary</i>
<i>confrontation with the gunman</i>

21:16.608 --> 21:19.194
<i>has already racked up</i>
<i>half a million views.</i>

21:19.278 --> 21:22.281
<i>Oliver, recovering from injuries</i>
<i>sustained during the attack</i>

21:22.364 --> 21:24.700
<i>has not responded to interview requests.</i>

21:25.367 --> 21:26.868
<i>Today's Belle Isle shooting…</i>

21:54.187 --> 21:55.647
Have you seen the news?

21:57.024 --> 21:58.400
We've got a problem.

22:00.110 --> 22:00.944
It's her.

22:26.386 --> 22:27.387
Be careful.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.805
I'll make you some tea.

22:28.889 --> 22:29.931
You should pack.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.379
Fucking fake useless bitch!

23:43.004 --> 23:44.131
There you go.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.267
Need anything else?

23:55.350 --> 23:56.268
No. Just…

23:57.686 --> 23:59.020
take Andy with you.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.357
Laura, the day was as fucked as it gets.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.859
I know.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.946
So, don't make it harder
for your daughter.

24:09.447 --> 24:12.534
I'm trying to help her.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.327
Hmm.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.497
You sure that's the best way to do it?

24:23.962 --> 24:26.047
I knew that boy was gonna do something.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.303
I saw it in his eyes.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.018
And then Betsy was going on and on.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.149
You stopped him.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.073
It doesn't matter, it's too late now.

24:56.036 --> 24:56.870
Hey.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.458
Call them.

25:21.102 --> 25:21.937
Good night.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.563
Get some rest.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.535
You need to eat.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.996
Stop taking care of me.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.039
Come on, don't make me drink alone.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.587
You got a glass?

26:29.254 --> 26:31.298
Uh, yeah.

26:38.972 --> 26:39.973
How's Mom?

26:40.599 --> 26:41.683
I think she'll sleep.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.686
To your birthday.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.816
- We'll find another day to celebrate.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.989
- Thirty sucks.

27:16.926 --> 27:18.303
I didn't do anything.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.389
In the diner.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.395
You survived, Andy.
That's all that matters.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.654
Dispatch said
I should get some counseling.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.531
Mom already thought I needed a shrink.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.040
I saw what she did, but…

27:50.293 --> 27:51.711
It doesn't feel real.

27:55.715 --> 27:56.675
She's so…

27:58.760 --> 27:59.594
Cut off.

28:01.388 --> 28:02.806
- She's scared, Andy.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.432
She almost lost you today.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.186
You mean everything to your mom.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.605
Then why is she kicking me out?

28:10.688 --> 28:14.984
You know how your mom deals…
She shuts down.

28:17.821 --> 28:18.947
She just needs time.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.074
Yeah. Away from me.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.877
Hmm.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.345
What do you say you stay with me tonight

28:42.429 --> 28:44.681
and then we'll see
how things look tomorrow?

28:45.765 --> 28:47.559
I just need to pack some things.

28:47.642 --> 28:48.852
Okay, I'll be back.

28:49.519 --> 28:50.979
I have my bike, I'm okay.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.859
Happy birthday to you.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.780
- Eat the sandwich.

29:05.952 --> 29:07.745
We're gonna get some weather.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.589
<i>I'm cold.</i>

29:19.757 --> 29:21.092
<i>Is it snowing?</i>

31:20.962 --> 31:21.796
Oh, shit.

32:58.851 --> 32:59.852
Who are you?

33:00.853 --> 33:02.480
It doesn't matter…

33:02.563 --> 33:04.023
What do you want?

33:10.029 --> 33:11.864
There's nothing to talk about.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.495
He doesn't want your money.

33:21.082 --> 33:23.835
- Paula was right about you.
- Paula Kunde--

33:23.918 --> 33:24.919
Shut up.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.344
Please, no!

33:33.428 --> 33:35.888
Please! Please!

34:07.378 --> 34:09.338
- Andy! Andy!

34:09.422 --> 34:10.590
- Andy!

34:22.101 --> 34:23.102
Get up.

34:23.686 --> 34:24.979
You… You're okay.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.106
Andy, it…

34:28.399 --> 34:29.859
- It's okay.

34:29.942 --> 34:30.860
Andy!

34:33.780 --> 34:35.656
It… It… It's… It's okay.

34:36.240 --> 34:37.074
The police.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.868
- Oh, God, why--
- What?

34:40.745 --> 34:44.415
- Baby, did you call 911?

34:48.211 --> 34:50.171
Okay. Can you help me?

34:50.254 --> 34:51.130
Can you…

34:51.214 --> 34:54.342
There, um… Scissors there,
can you please just get…

34:54.425 --> 34:57.386
Can you see them in the dark?
They're just there.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.931
That's it.
Okay, come here and cut this tape.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.103
Thank you.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.980
Okay, now, I need you
to go through his pockets.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.273
Okay? Can you do that?

35:09.357 --> 35:12.527
Can you go through his pockets for me?

35:13.361 --> 35:16.322
Andy. Andrea, we don't have
much time. I know you can do it.

35:16.405 --> 35:17.740
Go through his pockets.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.742
God, shit, where is it?

35:24.122 --> 35:24.997
Okay.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.625
Come on, honey.

35:28.417 --> 35:29.335
Give me his phone.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.630
His car will be around here. Okay?

35:32.713 --> 35:33.923
You need to find it

35:34.006 --> 35:35.883
- and drive to Carrollton.
- What?

35:35.967 --> 35:38.302
There's money in here, a phone,
and a key card.

35:38.386 --> 35:41.222
In Carrollton,
there's a storage place called Get-Em-Go.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.890
You look for unit 320, okay?

35:42.974 --> 35:45.184
- I don't understand.
- 320. Are you listening?

35:45.268 --> 35:46.769
- But why do you--
- Just say it!

35:46.853 --> 35:48.938
- The 320.
- 320, that's right.

35:49.021 --> 35:51.858
Okay, now, I have a car there. Okay?

35:51.941 --> 35:55.278
So, take it and head north,
all the way to Maine.

35:55.361 --> 35:57.655
Find a motel in Camden
and just stay there.

35:57.738 --> 35:58.948
I want to call Gordon.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.491
- Where's your phone?
- In the garage.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.076
- Just leave it.
- What? Why?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.162
You can't talk to Gordon nor anyone.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.372
No calls, no texting. Nothing.

36:06.455 --> 36:07.748
Don't use the car's GPS.

36:07.832 --> 36:11.669
And don't tell anyone where you are
until you hear my voice on this phone.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.588
What? Why did he want to hurt you?

36:13.671 --> 36:16.299
- Honey, I'll explain when I call.
- I can't just go to Maine.

36:16.382 --> 36:19.260
Yes, you can! Just get to Carrollton,
then drive to Maine.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.430
- But what about the police?
- It's better if you're not here!

36:25.391 --> 36:28.019
Look, I will call you
as soon as it's safe.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.980
When you hear my voice, you can come home.
You understand?

36:31.063 --> 36:32.565
I'm not leaving you.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.108
Oh, Andrea Louise.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.361
I love you more than anything,
but you've got to trust me. Okay?

36:37.445 --> 36:38.654
You gotta go.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.448
- You've gotta go.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.139
Fuck.
