19:47.394 --> 19:48.980
And I want my keys back.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.523
You don't want me

19:48.980 --> 19:50.523
to hold your keys?

19:50.523 --> 19:51.524
You can't be trusted.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.818
All right,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.818
all right, fine.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.569
And I don't want you

19:53.818 --> 19:55.569
to hold mine.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.737
Good. I won't.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.238
Good. Don't.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.532
Are these my keys?

19:59.532 --> 20:00.700
These aren't my keys.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.701
Whose are these?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.369
I don't know.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.925
I just thought

20:15.048 --> 20:17.925
I could write it.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.219
Is that something

20:17.925 --> 20:20.219
you want to do?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.138
I don't know.

20:22.138 --> 20:25.099
Those writers

20:22.138 --> 20:25.099
make a lot of money.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.020
What?

20:29.020 --> 20:31.397
Let me tell you something

20:29.020 --> 20:31.397
about show business.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.024
Ugh...

20:33.024 --> 20:35.109
I can't believe it.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.109
It's hard work.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.153
You don't just write

20:35.109 --> 20:37.153
a<i> Murphy Brown.</i>

20:37.153 --> 20:38.529
You've gotta

20:37.153 --> 20:38.529
watch the show,

20:38.529 --> 20:40.531
study it, get a sense

20:38.529 --> 20:40.531
of the characters,

20:40.531 --> 20:42.116
how they relate

20:40.531 --> 20:42.116
to each other...

20:42.116 --> 20:45.203
Okay, can I just

20:42.116 --> 20:45.203
watch the show?

20:46.871 --> 20:49.540
Oh, God,

20:46.871 --> 20:49.540
what an ass...

20:55.171 --> 20:56.214
What did you say?

20:59.133 --> 21:01.010
I didn't say anything.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.388
I heard something.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.600
Elaine, Elaine,

21:05.681 --> 21:07.600

21:11.395 --> 21:13.773
Kramer's on<i> Murphy Brown?</i>

21:11.395 --> 21:13.773
Look, there he is.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.233
He's sitting at the desk!

21:16.525 --> 21:17.777

[♪♪♪]

21:53.938 --> 21:55.648
So I fly a lot. I like planes.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.108
I was on a plane the other day,

21:57.108 --> 21:59.110
and I was wondering,

21:57.108 --> 21:59.110
"Are there keys to the plane?

21:59.110 --> 22:01.320
Do they need keys

21:59.110 --> 22:01.320
to start the plane?"

22:01.320 --> 22:03.906
Maybe that's what

22:01.320 --> 22:03.906
those delays on the ground are,

22:03.906 --> 22:05.532
when you're sitting

22:03.906 --> 22:05.532
at the gate.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.534
Maybe the pilot's

22:05.532 --> 22:07.534
in the cockpit going,

22:07.534 --> 22:10.079
"Oh, I don't believe this.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.331
Oh, my God.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.041
I did it again."

22:14.041 --> 22:16.169
They tell you

22:14.041 --> 22:16.169
it's something mechanical,

22:16.169 --> 22:18.296
because they don't want

22:16.169 --> 22:18.296
to come on the PA:

22:18.296 --> 22:19.672
"Ladies and gentlemen,

22:19.672 --> 22:22.466
we're gonna be delayed

22:19.672 --> 22:22.466
for a little while.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.218
Oh, God,

22:22.466 --> 22:24.218
this is so embarrassing.

22:24.218 --> 22:27.805
I... I left the keys

22:24.218 --> 22:27.805
to the plane in my apartment."

22:27.805 --> 22:29.182
You see the technicians

22:29.182 --> 22:30.432
all running

22:29.182 --> 22:30.432
underneath the plane.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.143
You think

22:30.432 --> 22:32.143
they're servicing it,

22:32.143 --> 22:34.352
but they're looking

22:32.143 --> 22:34.352
for the magnet hide-a-key

22:34.352 --> 22:37.481
under the wing. "Maybe he

22:34.352 --> 22:37.481
left it up there somewhere."
