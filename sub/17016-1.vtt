WEBVTT

02:45.971 --> 02:47.514
Put that away.

02:48.557 --> 02:49.724
Well done.

02:50.392 --> 02:53.980
Not as good as last time, but good.
Colleen ...

02:53.980 --> 02:58.067
- Don't forget, those of you who 
haven't completed your tally charts.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.152
Moron.

03:01.446 --> 03:02.488
Quiet!

03:02.864 --> 03:05.450
- Anna Madden, out!
- But it wasn't me.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.953
- Out!
- Sharon took my exercise book.

03:07.953 --> 03:10.789
- Liar!
- Out now or you're on detention.

03:10.789 --> 03:13.292
- But it was Sharon.
- Out!

03:13.542 --> 03:14.585
No.

03:15.210 --> 03:16.879
- Right, I'll see you after school.

03:22.844 --> 03:25.847
And wait where I can see you.

03:29.142 --> 03:33.022
Nigel, did I tell you to stand up?
No, so get back in your seat.

03:34.982 --> 03:38.402
Now, we all know how many degress there
are in a circle, don't we Nigel.

03:39.737 --> 03:43.032
Quit! The next person 
to laugh joins her.

03:43.574 --> 03:47.704
Right, we're starting something
new today. Another way of showing

03:47.704 --> 03:49.581
basic statistics.

03:50.582 --> 03:52.667
Pie charts.

03:53.710 --> 03:57.297
Now a pie chart is just another way of
showing information.

03:57.297 --> 04:00.510
Take for example the information we
took last week.

04:01.094 --> 04:04.639
Now what was the most common number of
letters in all your surnames?

04:04.639 --> 04:05.723
Seven.

04:05.723 --> 04:10.103
About half of you have seven letters
in your surnames. So ...

04:10.103 --> 04:13.315
what portion of the pie do
those people have?

04:13.816 --> 04:15.025
Half.

04:15.025 --> 04:17.986
180-degree slice of the pie.

04:19.029 --> 04:21.115
Now I'm going to make up
a different pie chart

04:21.115 --> 04:22.741
with a different set of information.

04:23.827 --> 04:26.329
How we spend our day.

04:27.372 --> 04:30.875
I'll do an example for you based
on my average weekday

04:30.875 --> 04:36.131
then I want you to make up a pie chart
based on your average Saturday.

04:37.591 --> 04:40.469
First, I write down my information.

04:40.469 --> 04:42.596
What are the things I do?

04:43.305 --> 04:46.434
Getting dressed and undressed.

04:47.393 --> 04:49.478
Eating.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.774
Travelling.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.652
School.

04:56.611 --> 04:58.697
Meeting friends.

05:01.992 --> 05:03.369
What?

05:03.369 --> 05:06.706
- I feel dizzy.
- She's lying!

05:06.706 --> 05:09.542
- I want to go home.
- She's lying, Miss!

05:09.542 --> 05:12.754
I'm not!
-Well you don't sound ill to me.

05:12.754 --> 05:17.926
If you disturb us again you're going
straight to Mr. Murphy. Understand?

05:17.926 --> 05:19.303
But it's my birthday.

05:19.303 --> 05:21.513
Well you should have thought
of that before.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.099
Quiet.

05:24.391 --> 05:28.353
And you can wipe that look off
your face, Sharon Davis.

05:28.353 --> 05:30.356
Where were we?

05:30.356 --> 05:32.859
Sleeping. Right.

05:32.859 --> 05:36.112
I spend one hour dressing
and undressing.

05:36.112 --> 05:38.281
About two and a half hours eating.

05:40.658 --> 05:42.286
About 8 hours at school.

06:18.324 --> 06:21.870
She passed out.

06:21.870 --> 06:25.124
- Is she gonna die?
- Trisham, go get matron.

06:34.175 --> 06:35.218
Thanks.

06:35.802 --> 06:36.803
Hi.

06:37.595 --> 06:38.972
How are you feeling?

06:38.972 --> 06:41.391
- Terrible, mum.
- That bad, eh?

06:41.391 --> 06:42.475
Worse.

06:42.475 --> 06:47.148
- Oh, but I'm sure it's nothing serious.
- I wish they hadn't called you.

06:47.148 --> 06:49.900
- I could have gone home by myself.
- Don't worry.

06:49.900 --> 06:53.320
Things were so busy at work that it
was really nice to get out of there.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.198
Listen, this'll cheer you up.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.868
It came after you left.
Guess who it's from?

07:00.203 --> 07:02.289
- Dad.
- Yeah.

07:14.010 --> 07:17.722
Happy 11th birthday.
Lots of love, Dad.

07:17.722 --> 07:21.851
Well, that's not all. There's something
very special fixed up for you.

07:21.851 --> 07:24.771
- What?
- No, it's a surprise.

07:24.771 --> 07:26.690
Riding lessons?

07:26.690 --> 07:29.276
Yeah, some surprise.

07:30.819 --> 07:35.032
Where's Mogadishu? -I think it's a
port on the east coast of Africa.

07:35.032 --> 07:37.868
Well they spelled my name wrong.
-Did they?

07:39.245 --> 07:41.331
Oh ... it's just a mistake.

07:43.833 --> 07:47.003
- Maybe I could send a reply.
- That's a nice idea.

07:53.719 --> 07:56.430
- I wish dad was here.
- So do I.

07:56.847 --> 08:01.393
- When's he coming back?
- Soon.

08:04.063 --> 08:06.024
How are you feeling now?

08:06.024 --> 08:10.987
- No worse. When is the riding lesson?
- It was meant to be after school today.

08:10.987 --> 08:13.198
Meant to be?

08:13.490 --> 08:15.575
Let's see what
Dr. Nicols says first.

08:15.826 --> 08:19.497
Do we have to? I'm sure if I just lay
down in front of the telly I'll be OK.

08:19.497 --> 08:22.083
Doctor first.
No arguing, okay?

08:27.296 --> 08:30.508
Stop!
Stop it!

08:30.842 --> 08:34.054
- I was pretending.
- Pretending?

08:34.638 --> 08:36.722
Sharon Davis stole my book.

08:36.722 --> 08:39.559
Then I pushed her off the chair and
Miss Vanstone put me on detention.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.480
I can't be on detention on my
birthday, can I? So I faked it.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.191
You faked it?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.735
So you're not ill?

08:53.032 --> 08:54.492
- Where are we going?
- Back.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.286
- I can't go back.
- Oh, you're going back.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.497
- I'll look stupid.
- Well you do already.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.583
Stupid cow.

09:00.583 --> 09:03.627
Just because it's your birthday don't
think you can talk to me like that.

09:04.003 --> 09:06.422
You should be pleased
there's nothing wrong with me.

09:06.422 --> 09:10.134
You're telling too many lies, Anna,
and it is going to stop.

09:11.178 --> 09:13.847
- What about my riding lesson?
- Oh, don't ask.

09:16.641 --> 09:17.851
We'll see.

09:17.851 --> 09:22.147
- What does that mean?
- It means we'll see.

09:29.489 --> 09:31.574
I hate you.

09:43.754 --> 09:44.797
Karen.

09:46.465 --> 09:48.759
Come here.

09:48.759 --> 09:52.055
- I was wondering where you got to.
- Shh ...

09:52.055 --> 09:54.224
Got the afternoon off.

09:55.308 --> 09:58.436
I'm having a really
miserable birthday.

10:00.605 --> 10:04.860
- You been using the sunlamp again?
- No, my skin just tans very fast ...

10:04.860 --> 10:06.070
naturally.

10:06.070 --> 10:09.740
I don't get brown;
I get sunstroke.

10:09.740 --> 10:12.326
Last year I fell asleep in a
deck chair on my dad's oil rig,

10:13.077 --> 10:16.748
and when I woke up I was
burnt to a frazzle.

10:17.999 --> 10:22.212
- Why's your mum so angry with you?
- 'Cause she's a cow.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.091
What was Gary's
party like then?

10:26.091 --> 10:29.303
Lots of snogging. Not much
else I can remember, really.

10:29.554 --> 10:33.307
- You had a nice time then?
- I suppose you could call it that.

10:33.724 --> 10:37.937
First I was upstairs with Nigel,
then on the sofa with Ronnie ...

10:37.937 --> 10:41.733
then Vaughn Hancock, pissed out of
his head, got me on the thick pile.

10:43.068 --> 10:45.279
You're lucky you haven't
started that yet.

10:45.279 --> 10:47.072
What's snogging like then?

10:47.072 --> 10:49.950
Well, like kissing a vacuum cleaner.

11:00.170 --> 11:02.797
This looks a real skill
place to play hide-and-seek.

11:02.797 --> 11:06.676
- I'm too old for that kind of thing.
- Bet you 50p you can't find me.

11:06.676 --> 11:08.137
- A quid.
- You're on.

11:09.847 --> 11:11.932
Close your eyes, count to 100,
and don't peek.

11:13.058 --> 11:16.812
1, 2, 3, 4 ...

12:01.653 --> 12:05.281
86, 87, 88 ...

12:17.878 --> 12:20.840
99, 100. I'm coming!

13:36.087 --> 13:38.173
Is anybody there?

13:41.092 --> 13:42.511
Karen!

14:13.711 --> 14:14.796
It's her.

14:36.611 --> 14:37.654
Anna.

14:39.322 --> 14:43.410
Don't ever do that to me again.
Never! What has got into you?

14:43.410 --> 14:45.745
Mum, I don't feel very well.

15:28.209 --> 15:30.294
Now open wide.

15:37.802 --> 15:41.138
My throat hurts ...
like I've swallowed dust.

15:43.642 --> 15:48.021
Gritty ... and it aches,
but that's all.

15:48.021 --> 15:49.981
You sure that's all?

15:49.981 --> 15:53.944
No fainting fits?
No dizziness?

15:53.944 --> 15:56.989
And this ache,
is it just in your throat?

15:57.698 --> 16:01.285
You've obviously had quite
an eventful birthday.

16:01.285 --> 16:04.497
- I suppose you could call it that.
- Sorry to drag you out like this ...

16:04.497 --> 16:06.124
but I was worried.

16:06.124 --> 16:07.918
I don't blame you.

16:07.918 --> 16:09.711
Look, I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

16:09.711 --> 16:12.631
She should have a
couple of days rest.

16:12.631 --> 16:14.800
What I don't understand is
what happened in the tunnel?

16:15.801 --> 16:17.469
Anna.

16:21.933 --> 16:24.978
What happened
in the tunnel?

16:24.978 --> 16:27.147
Fell asleep and lost track
of time. You know....

16:29.023 --> 16:33.111
- That doesn't sound like you.
- I'll have that throat swab analyzed.

16:33.111 --> 16:36.198
And you're obviously running
quite a temperature.

16:36.198 --> 16:39.451
- And I think a day or two in bed ...
- When it goes down can I go riding?

16:39.952 --> 16:42.997
- You must rest for a couple of days.
- I'm not staying in bed.

16:42.997 --> 16:43.831
Don't.

16:43.831 --> 16:45.791
Well, think of it this way:
if you rest now you'll get better

16:45.791 --> 16:50.046
sooner. You rush around, who
knows how long it might take.

16:50.046 --> 16:52.674
How long exactly do
I have to stay in bed?

16:52.674 --> 16:54.217
I'll come and see you again
at the end of the week.

16:54.593 --> 16:57.387
- The end of the week?
- Count yourself lucky.

16:57.387 --> 17:00.892
I've got a patient a little bit older
than you whose been in bed for a year.

17:00.892 --> 17:02.768
I'd rather die than that.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.771
You and he would get on well.

17:06.230 --> 17:09.025
No we wouldn't: I hate boys.

17:09.567 --> 17:14.114
- I'll see you on Friday then.
- Goodnight Sarah

17:15.199 --> 17:16.909
Here Sarah, I'll show you out.

17:17.326 --> 17:20.537
Is there someone who can come and look
after Anna whilst you're at work?

17:20.871 --> 17:21.914
No.

17:22.664 --> 17:24.790
- I'll have to take some time off.
- You okay?

17:26.294 --> 17:29.297
Yeah. I could do with
a break, that's all.

17:29.297 --> 17:30.799
Tired?

17:30.799 --> 17:31.883
Yeah.

17:33.092 --> 17:36.971
It's always difficult when
John's away, and I just ...

17:38.724 --> 17:40.851
I don't know....

17:40.851 --> 17:42.228
Too sad.

18:09.173 --> 18:10.925
Is anybody there?

18:20.602 --> 18:23.188
Is anybody there?

18:32.907 --> 18:34.993
Can I come in?

18:37.829 --> 18:40.081
I can't hear you.

18:46.839 --> 18:50.843
- I said go away.
- No, you let me in, then I'll go away.

18:50.843 --> 18:53.429
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

18:53.429 --> 18:56.515
'Cause there aren't
any stairs.

18:56.515 --> 19:00.979
- How did you get up there then?
- I don't know. I'm just here.

19:02.898 --> 19:06.109
Can't you tell someone else to let
me in? -There isn't anyone else.

19:07.903 --> 19:10.156
Look, just stop mucking
around and let me in.

19:10.656 --> 19:14.494
Go away, don't you understand,
it's dangerous around here, dangerous.

20:12.430 --> 20:13.306
It's real.

23:37.568 --> 23:38.486
There are stairs.

23:40.780 --> 23:44.910
- You were wrong about the stairs.
- Must have come since.

23:45.911 --> 23:46.870
Since I drew them.

23:49.540 --> 23:50.499
You shouldn't be here.

23:52.543 --> 23:54.169
I knew I should've
made you more cheerful.

23:55.212 --> 23:57.966
I drew you, this house,
the stairs, everything.

23:58.633 --> 24:00.552
Come and have a look, come on.

24:02.136 --> 24:03.096
I can't walk.

24:06.724 --> 24:09.018
Of course, I didn't draw you any legs.

24:13.357 --> 24:14.567
I'm not a drawing!

24:21.157 --> 24:24.911
I'm sorry, I just drew someone
at the window, that's all.

24:26.788 --> 24:27.914
It's alright.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.586
My name's Mark, what's yours?

24:36.716 --> 24:37.633
Mark!

25:03.453 --> 25:04.412
Mum?

25:07.457 --> 25:10.210
And one, and two, and three...

25:18.219 --> 25:20.638
- Mum?
- What?

25:22.056 --> 25:23.933
- Mum?
- Go away please.

25:24.850 --> 25:25.768
- What's wrong mum?

25:29.439 --> 25:31.525
Nothing, I just don't
want you ruining this print.

25:36.821 --> 25:39.616
- Feeling better?
- No, worse.

25:42.745 --> 25:44.205
What photo are you doing?

25:46.707 --> 25:48.334
The one you took on
the beach last summer.

25:57.135 --> 26:01.265
I'm having dreams mum, but
they're real, I know they are.

26:01.974 --> 26:03.517
Dreams can't be real sweetie.

26:09.107 --> 26:10.108
It's dad!

26:12.861 --> 26:14.737
They might frighten you
but they can never hurt you.

26:16.239 --> 26:19.450
- How do you know? - Because if
they could they wouldn't be dreams.

26:25.958 --> 26:29.503
- No, leave it, I like the
clouds dark. - Alright, darling.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.267
Oh that's too much.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.272
Come on, we're gonna get you to bed.

26:46.689 --> 26:51.444
- No, i'll be alright if I stay awake.
- No, come on, come on right now.

27:39.454 --> 27:41.623
On the other side of
the hill is the sea.

27:52.760 --> 27:57.557
It shines out for miles and
miles and everyone can see it.

28:10.362 --> 28:12.072
It looks like glandular fever.

28:13.866 --> 28:17.620
I lied to you about the fainting,
it's happened several times.

28:18.705 --> 28:20.206
I guessed you weren't
telling the truth.

28:24.544 --> 28:27.797
That's all though,
you didn't need to come.

28:28.923 --> 28:31.802
- I'm getting much better.
- Your mother was right to call me.

28:33.637 --> 28:37.141
- Is it bad? - Well, it'll
knock you out for a few weeks.

28:42.813 --> 28:44.274
Your pulse is right up.

28:46.776 --> 28:47.944
So are these glands.

28:57.538 --> 29:00.166
- What have you been upto in here?
- Nothing.

29:02.293 --> 29:06.339
- When did you last faint.
- After I saw you, yesterday.

29:07.089 --> 29:07.632
I see.

29:11.929 --> 29:12.554
Sarah?

29:14.389 --> 29:17.017
- You know this boy you see?
- Yes.

29:18.101 --> 29:19.853
When's he going to be able to get up?

29:21.313 --> 29:24.901
Well, he can get up, he just doesn't
want to most of the time, that's all.

29:25.610 --> 29:26.903
He's getting better though?

29:29.948 --> 29:32.200
You're really interested
in my other patients Anna?

29:32.867 --> 29:36.121
- Doesn't he want to get better?
- Well of course he does.

29:37.206 --> 29:38.874
Then why doesn't he get out of bed?

29:39.917 --> 29:42.461
As long as he gets enough books to
read he's content to stay in bed.

29:42.920 --> 29:46.257
That's terrible, I
can't stand staying in bed.

29:46.632 --> 29:48.927
If you told me I could
get up tomorrow i'd be up.

29:49.344 --> 29:52.055
Well it isn't just a question
of getting up, it's just that...

29:52.764 --> 29:55.225
Exercise is too much
bother and pain for Mark.

29:58.728 --> 30:00.772
- Mark, can't walk?
- No.

30:05.528 --> 30:06.696
What wrong Anna?

30:15.956 --> 30:17.499
We're just opposites
me and him, aren't we?

30:20.711 --> 30:23.297
He's got to do exercise
and doesn't want to...

30:23.964 --> 30:26.758
and i've got to stay in
bed and I don't want to.

30:28.386 --> 30:30.263
It's a pity you
can't mix us up a bit.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.852
Well I dare say you two are
each better off as you are.

30:39.522 --> 30:40.983
I'll have a word with
Kate on my way out.

30:43.777 --> 30:44.737
Bye Anna.

31:14.477 --> 31:15.811
Now he'll walk.

31:29.660 --> 31:30.410
Mark!

31:32.830 --> 31:33.706
Mark!

31:41.422 --> 31:42.382
Mark?

32:09.744 --> 32:11.329
Oh, no cones.

32:18.045 --> 32:18.880
Hi.

32:22.633 --> 32:25.012
Whoever left this
should've left some instructions.

32:25.804 --> 32:28.765
It seems to be based on the
Apple design, it's a bit crude.

32:30.642 --> 32:31.852
I'll fix that tomorrow.

32:32.936 --> 32:36.189
I suppose you'll tell me you drew it,
that would explain why it's so mental.

32:42.488 --> 32:43.990
You've been moving things around.

32:47.660 --> 32:48.745
My name's Anna.

32:55.920 --> 32:59.215
- I drew you walking but it went wrong.
- I don't undertstand you.

33:07.933 --> 33:10.477
- You like reading don't you?
- Yeah.

33:17.568 --> 33:21.239
- Then you are Mark?
- Well i'm not a drawing, I know that.

33:21.531 --> 33:24.116
I've got the same doctor
as you, Dr Nichols.

33:24.367 --> 33:25.284
Not me.

33:26.827 --> 33:32.084
- I mean... when you're not here.
- Look, i'm always here.

33:33.377 --> 33:36.088
- They left me here.
- Who left you here?

33:46.516 --> 33:47.767
It's great, isn't it?

33:49.477 --> 33:52.188
Do you want some fruit?
It's really good for you.

33:53.273 --> 33:53.982
Ok.

34:48.875 --> 34:49.708
Behind you!

34:53.795 --> 34:54.755
Very funny.

34:58.343 --> 35:02.014
Very funny, I could've broken
my leg, you're so stupid.

35:17.864 --> 35:19.199
There was this boy...

35:21.034 --> 35:22.452
about my age...

35:23.995 --> 35:26.831
he had a bike, a blue one...

35:28.167 --> 35:29.710
it was in perfect nick.

35:31.128 --> 35:35.091
Although he loved this bike,
he couldn't ride it.

35:36.842 --> 35:41.306
He'd just watch it every day and having
it there made all the difference.

35:42.432 --> 35:47.187
But one day he'd ride it and that
was all that ever mattered to him.

35:53.152 --> 35:54.279
Why are you here Mark?

35:57.991 --> 36:02.328
I did something wrong,
I expect that's why you're here too.

36:02.912 --> 36:05.039
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- Oh I bet!

36:05.582 --> 36:07.418
But I haven't done anything wrong.

36:08.127 --> 36:11.505
Maybe all this stuff's here for you
and you're to stay here like me.

36:12.172 --> 36:14.216
No chance, this is a dream.

36:16.385 --> 36:17.428
That's what I thought.

36:19.806 --> 36:22.225
Do you think whoever brought you
here will come back again?

36:23.059 --> 36:24.060
I hope not.

36:25.270 --> 36:29.274
If my dad was here
he could carry you...

36:30.317 --> 36:33.946
and you could run away
with us, then you'd be safe.

36:34.697 --> 36:36.115
And you wouldn't be afraid any more.

37:12.696 --> 37:14.156
He looks like a madman.

37:20.621 --> 37:21.538
Hello darling.

37:32.717 --> 37:34.636
- What's that?
- A radio.

37:35.929 --> 37:39.058
- It doesn't look like a radio,
it's too big. - It's a radio.

37:51.405 --> 37:52.447
Who's that?

37:54.199 --> 37:56.201
That's dad, that's good.

37:59.079 --> 38:02.624
I think he looks drunk,
I hate it when he's drunk.

38:02.833 --> 38:04.252
He stopped drinking years ago.

38:06.170 --> 38:07.922
He was drunk when
I took that picture.

38:09.632 --> 38:12.302
- Why don't you have your soup.
- He was, wasn't he?

38:14.095 --> 38:14.846
Let me see.

38:19.268 --> 38:22.146
Well, a bit, maybe.

38:24.982 --> 38:26.525
You could rub it out and try again.

38:28.694 --> 38:31.281
- I can't.
- It's almost right, it's just...

38:31.281 --> 38:34.826
His head's a bit too big
and he looks sort of angry.

38:37.787 --> 38:38.747
What is it?

38:39.247 --> 38:43.169
Why don't you go back to work, I
don't like you hanging around here.

38:44.337 --> 38:47.089
- I'll be alright. - Listen,
it's good, it's really good.

38:50.176 --> 38:53.971
- It's total rubbish!
- It's only a drawing Anna, come on.

38:54.847 --> 38:57.517
That's right, it's only a drawing.

39:00.187 --> 39:01.939
I think it's good, I really do.

39:05.275 --> 39:07.361
It's just that i'm
having those dreams again...

39:08.111 --> 39:11.616
and i'm frightened dad's going to come
into those dreams looking like that.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.662
Listen, if dad came into your
dreams that would be nice.

39:16.246 --> 39:18.498
And no drawing is going
to make any difference.

39:20.291 --> 39:23.587
- Have I done anything wrong?
- Do you ever do anything right?

39:24.255 --> 39:26.090
I must've done something really bad.

39:26.882 --> 39:29.093
It's nothing you've done,
that's silly, don't think that.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.762
- Then why don't you believe me?
- Believe what?

39:32.054 --> 39:34.306
That my dreams are frightening me.

39:34.599 --> 39:37.143
- I do believe you.
- No you don't.

39:37.352 --> 39:38.311
Listen...

39:41.565 --> 39:44.901
I know it's hard for you with
dad away all the time but...

39:46.027 --> 39:50.324
It's hard for me too, we've
got to try to get on better.

39:54.787 --> 39:57.206
- Will you promise me something?
- What?

39:58.082 --> 40:02.963
You've got to be honest with me about
when you pass out and when you...

40:03.880 --> 40:08.135
see things that maybe
I don't see, you understand?

40:09.386 --> 40:11.722
It's really important
Anna, you have to promise.

40:12.514 --> 40:14.934
I always tell you the truth.

40:21.357 --> 40:24.944
A nice hot bath and then to bed.

41:51.079 --> 41:51.913
Mum!

41:54.374 --> 41:54.958
Mum!

42:04.885 --> 42:09.390
- I don't feel well. - I know, I know,
you try and get some sleep, ok?

42:11.518 --> 42:14.521
- My head hurts. - I know
but I have to dry your hair.

42:24.324 --> 42:26.284
There, just a bit more.

42:28.870 --> 42:29.454
Ok.

42:39.173 --> 42:43.427
- Will you set my alarm for me? - Why,
are you going somewhere special tomorrow?

42:45.930 --> 42:48.849
- Set it for 7.
- Ok.

42:59.152 --> 43:00.403
I'll just get your teddy.

43:08.871 --> 43:13.292
Stay with me until I get to sleep,
I don't wanna be on my own.

43:13.918 --> 43:14.919
Sure.

43:17.297 --> 43:20.676
I'll just be a second, I just have
to get something from my room.

43:55.171 --> 43:56.214
No dreams.

44:09.145 --> 44:11.772
- That was quick.
- I'm late.

44:13.774 --> 44:14.775
Is something the matter?

44:15.860 --> 44:18.112
I'm very busy this morning,
I should be at the hospital.

44:19.280 --> 44:21.575
Well perhaps I should've
got worse yesterday.

44:22.492 --> 44:24.411
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

44:26.121 --> 44:29.750
- You're miserable today. - Well even
doctors get miserable sometimes Anna.

44:31.710 --> 44:33.962
- Is it something I did?
- Don't think so.

44:41.012 --> 44:41.888
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:42.722 --> 44:44.474
I've given you some
mild sleeping pills...

44:44.474 --> 44:46.142
keep a very close eye
on her temperature...

44:46.142 --> 44:48.020
and let me know immediately
if she seems delirious.

44:48.228 --> 44:50.064
It's not very likely,
she seems stable now.

44:50.648 --> 44:53.817
Sarah, are you sure you're
alright, you look worried.

44:55.110 --> 44:58.739
It's just a young boy I thought
was ok had a relapse yesterday.

44:59.031 --> 45:00.074
What's wrong with him?

45:00.867 --> 45:03.536
He has muscular dystrophy,
he's got a chest infection.

45:03.870 --> 45:05.705
- Oh no.
- It's dangerous.

45:35.570 --> 45:36.905
Anna, what are you doing?

45:37.155 --> 45:39.074
Mum, last night you
cleared up my bedroom...

45:39.325 --> 45:41.995
I threw something away,
where's the rubbish?

45:41.995 --> 45:43.246
I've got to find it.

45:43.621 --> 45:46.749
I leave you alone for 5 minutes and
you work yourself up into a frenzy.

45:47.083 --> 45:49.794
But I threw something away
and i've got to find it.

45:49.794 --> 45:51.045
- What is it.
- A drawing.

45:51.045 --> 45:54.008
- A drawing? Can't you do another one?
- No!

45:54.800 --> 45:58.304
Alright, i'll go and look, but only if
you promise to take 2 of these pills.

45:58.596 --> 45:59.388
Yeah!

46:01.557 --> 46:06.354
- Yes, yes, just find it. - Ok, ok,
here, stop it, stop, here, Anna!

46:08.773 --> 46:11.443
God, well if it's not there
there's nothing I can do, ok?

46:14.779 --> 46:17.407
- No that's not ok.
- Well, i'll find it alright.

46:43.810 --> 46:44.687
Anna!

46:45.772 --> 46:48.149
Wait! Don't!

46:49.150 --> 46:51.986
Anna! Anna!

46:52.820 --> 46:55.490
Come back! Anna!

46:58.577 --> 47:01.580
Wait! Anna!

47:05.000 --> 47:05.918
Wait!

47:10.172 --> 47:11.299
Come on love, out of the way.

47:11.716 --> 47:14.427
No, I have to find something,
I threw it away by mistake.

47:14.719 --> 47:16.388
- To bed now, come on!
-  No!

47:18.181 --> 47:20.850
You're going to be sick,
really sick unless you calm down.

47:26.023 --> 47:28.276
You've gotta help me
find it mum, please.

47:31.946 --> 47:35.032
Can you help?
- What type of bag was it?

47:35.241 --> 47:35.992
Black!

47:36.827 --> 47:39.162
Ok boys, we're looking for a black bag!

47:40.247 --> 47:42.666
Please, let me check them.

47:44.001 --> 47:45.502
Open them mum, open them.

47:54.512 --> 47:56.681
- You missed one.
- I'm doing my best.

47:59.517 --> 48:00.685
It could be any of these.

48:07.610 --> 48:10.571
- Look, you've lost the drawing
Anna, just accept it. - No!

48:10.904 --> 48:12.990
- That's your lot.
- You didn't check that one.

48:12.990 --> 48:15.159
If we checked every one
we'd be here all day.

48:15.159 --> 48:17.120
It's no good Anna, stop it now.

48:22.208 --> 48:23.418
There!

49:33.118 --> 49:35.913
You're going to be alright
now darling, you must sleep.

50:18.667 --> 50:19.793
Mark?

50:22.630 --> 50:23.505
Mark?

50:37.687 --> 50:38.480
Fooled you!

50:39.357 --> 50:40.775
Your face.

50:47.281 --> 50:48.199
Sorry Anna.

50:51.619 --> 50:53.789
- How you feeling?
- Fine.

51:00.087 --> 51:01.588
You did all this then, eh?

51:03.674 --> 51:05.218
I don't understand you.

51:05.259 --> 51:08.346
Mark, do you remember
anything about the real world?

51:08.638 --> 51:10.014
But this is the real world.

51:12.100 --> 51:13.101
I suppose so.

51:14.143 --> 51:17.522
When i'm not here I know where
I am... and you're there too.

51:20.359 --> 51:23.862
- What's wrong with me?
- You're in hospital.

51:25.906 --> 51:28.284
I wish you weren't, sorry.

51:31.036 --> 51:35.667
Well you're right about
one thing... I am ill.

51:37.669 --> 51:44.093
I'm tired, like i've just run
a marathon but all the time.

51:45.469 --> 51:48.306
And the big joke is I have to crawl
to move from this lump of wood.

51:49.181 --> 51:52.184
- That must be really uncomfortable.
- And cold.

52:10.830 --> 52:15.627
Instead of making a mess out of
this place... why don't you help me?

52:26.472 --> 52:27.723
I think I should wake up now.

52:38.443 --> 52:41.404
- I can't wake up.
- I told you so.

52:48.536 --> 52:50.373
- They've come for us.
- Who?

52:58.589 --> 53:02.218
- It's dad!
- No, don't let him in.

53:02.719 --> 53:04.471
- Rubbish, i'll go and fetch him.
- No!

53:09.935 --> 53:10.894
Dad!

53:14.856 --> 53:15.817
Dad!

53:18.778 --> 53:20.863
Dad, come in, it's getting dark.

53:23.157 --> 53:27.662
- Anna, is that you?
- Yes.

53:30.249 --> 53:31.583
I'm blind!

53:35.713 --> 53:36.714
No locks.

53:40.634 --> 53:42.679
Anna, he's moving,
he's got a hammer.

54:07.664 --> 54:10.125
- Anna!
- Go away.

54:13.962 --> 54:14.755
Anna.

54:16.590 --> 54:17.424
Are you ok?

54:19.509 --> 54:20.845
Let me in Anna.

54:22.847 --> 54:26.392
- Behind the hills is a sea,
we have to go there. - You go.

54:26.643 --> 54:31.064
- Listen, we can ride the bike.
- How can I ride a bike, be realistic.

54:31.648 --> 54:32.982
You ride and i'll push.

54:33.776 --> 54:35.069
- You're mad.
- Anna!

54:35.069 --> 54:36.779
Please Mark, you have to try.

54:44.536 --> 54:49.292
Anna, i'm not going away so
you might aswell let me in.

54:51.419 --> 54:56.091
Let me in Anna!
Open this door now!

55:22.661 --> 55:25.247
- You'll never get
me up on this. - Try.

56:10.546 --> 56:11.297
Anna.

56:13.299 --> 56:16.010
- Don't leave me.
- Of course I won't.

56:16.010 --> 56:17.846
- Don't leave me.
- Of course I won't leave you.

56:18.472 --> 56:20.349
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared.

56:24.436 --> 56:25.479
There.

56:30.192 --> 56:33.321
You've had a really bad fever darling
but I think this is the worst of it.

56:37.950 --> 56:39.410
When you're better
we'll go to the seaside.

56:42.246 --> 56:43.414
You like the sea.

56:46.335 --> 56:50.881
We'll go there, all 3 of us, and
we'll have a big, long rest, ok.

56:52.466 --> 56:56.011
To the sea, to the sea,
to the beautiful sea.

56:59.432 --> 57:01.309
Let me see, let me see it.

57:03.979 --> 57:07.357
You're temperature's going down,
it's normal, you're getting better.

57:09.442 --> 57:10.653
- Don't.
- What.

57:13.030 --> 57:14.490
- Who are you?
- Anna?

57:15.700 --> 57:18.119
I don't talk to strangers, go away.

57:20.371 --> 57:22.623
- Go away.
- It's mummy, you're alright now.

57:22.958 --> 57:24.251
Go away!

57:27.045 --> 57:27.921
Anna!

57:28.880 --> 57:31.008
What are you doing? Darling?

57:34.219 --> 57:37.598
Anna! Look at me, look at me!

57:38.558 --> 57:41.477
Anna, please, don't!

57:43.604 --> 57:47.108
Anna, please, don't!

57:48.026 --> 57:48.860
Anna!

58:18.517 --> 58:19.518
Mark?

58:40.749 --> 58:41.542
Mark?

59:29.635 --> 59:30.594
Mark?

01:00:02.713 --> 01:00:03.922
He must've taken him.

01:00:47.803 --> 01:00:48.553
Mark?

01:00:52.266 --> 01:00:52.975
Mark?

01:00:56.646 --> 01:00:57.438
Mark?

01:00:58.773 --> 01:00:59.774
Anna?

01:01:02.235 --> 01:01:03.236
Anna?

01:01:11.245 --> 01:01:12.579
You're going to be alright.

01:01:14.915 --> 01:01:16.208
Just stay where you are.

01:01:21.506 --> 01:01:22.590
Daddy's here.

01:01:24.592 --> 01:01:25.260
Anna!

01:01:53.457 --> 01:01:54.541
Alright...

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.421
if you want to play games...

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:08.222
One, two, three...

01:02:09.683 --> 01:02:14.938
four, five, six...

01:02:16.106 --> 01:02:21.695
seven, eight, twelve,

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:27.786
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:34.876
It's you he's after not me,
you should've never come back.

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:37.421
I thought that he'd taken you.

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:39.382
Listen. it won't take
him long to find us...

01:02:39.382 --> 01:02:42.343
You've gotta wake up and change
your stupid drawing, get rid of him.

01:02:42.385 --> 01:02:43.219
I've tried.

01:02:43.219 --> 01:02:45.680
No, rip him out of the
paper, it's the only way.

01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:50.727
- I drew a lighthouse, we can go
there then we'll be safe. - Ok.

01:02:50.727 --> 01:02:53.772
Look, just wake up, we're not going
to get anywhere with him around.

01:02:54.106 --> 01:02:54.898
I can't.

01:02:55.399 --> 01:02:57.442
- Wake up! - I can't.

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:04.784
Thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three...

01:03:05.243 --> 01:03:09.789
Thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six...

01:03:11.165 --> 01:03:12.250
I've got an idea.

01:03:13.376 --> 01:03:15.838
Lie down like you're in bed... do it!

01:03:29.352 --> 01:03:30.812
Reach out to where the drawing is.

01:03:47.955 --> 01:03:49.498
Pick up the drawing Anna.

01:03:58.717 --> 01:03:59.509
Careful!

01:04:16.611 --> 01:04:20.491
- Dad's on the left, by the rocks.
- Put your finger on him.

01:04:28.582 --> 01:04:32.879
Eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine...

01:04:36.216 --> 01:04:37.509
Now rip him out!

01:04:53.275 --> 01:04:56.779
Ninety-nine, one hundred.

01:04:58.656 --> 01:05:00.951
I'm coming.

01:05:33.777 --> 01:05:35.154
Run Anna, leave me.

01:05:40.493 --> 01:05:41.077
Anna!

01:05:42.746 --> 01:05:45.040
Mark, Mark!

01:05:48.293 --> 01:05:49.252
Mark!

01:06:17.909 --> 01:06:19.369
Get off me!

01:06:38.681 --> 01:06:39.890
Who are you?

01:06:41.975 --> 01:06:44.854
- What is your name?
- Please, dad, please.

01:06:46.356 --> 01:06:47.357
Do you know me?

01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:51.361
Do you recognise me?

01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:17.371
The sea.

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:34.453
Anna?

01:09:36.497 --> 01:09:38.666
- Anna.
- It's alright love, it's just the tube.

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:41.544
There's a brave girl.

01:09:43.796 --> 01:09:46.800
You'll be alright, you'll be alright.

01:10:08.198 --> 01:10:08.948
Anna?

01:10:12.203 --> 01:10:13.871
It hurts when I breathe.

01:10:15.456 --> 01:10:17.291
That's just your ribs,
they're a bit bruised.

01:10:18.501 --> 01:10:20.836
The ambulance man had
to give you a heart massage.

01:10:21.796 --> 01:10:25.634
- He saved your life.
- I know but it still hurts.

01:10:26.593 --> 01:10:27.969
You'll be out of here in a few days.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.765
I've been here long enough.

01:10:35.727 --> 01:10:36.603
How's Mark?

01:10:40.942 --> 01:10:42.527
- How's Mark?
- He's ok.

01:10:43.277 --> 01:10:44.487
Don't lie to me.

01:10:46.614 --> 01:10:49.033
We sent him home, he'll
be more comfortable there.

01:10:50.326 --> 01:10:51.662
He's dying isn't he?

01:10:56.875 --> 01:11:00.129
- They've stopped.
- What's stopped.

01:11:01.922 --> 01:11:03.090
My dreams.

01:11:13.601 --> 01:11:16.939
If I tell you something,
will you keep it a secret?

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:24.864
- I know Mark, I know him
from my dreams. - Anna...

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:29.828
I drew a house on paper,
Mark's there too.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:37.794
It was me who made Mark ill and
me who helped him get better again.

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:45.428
Then we had to escape and we
did but now I can't even dream.

01:11:48.056 --> 01:11:49.432
You have to believe me.

01:11:51.476 --> 01:11:54.604
When you're ill the
mind plays funny tricks.

01:11:55.646 --> 01:11:58.776
It's not a trick...
Mark's eyes are blue...

01:12:00.944 --> 01:12:03.197
His left leg is
stronger than his right...

01:12:05.574 --> 01:12:09.537
He's got a bicycle,
a blue one, he just looks at it.

01:12:09.537 --> 01:12:11.956
- How do you know all this?
- It's true isn't it?

01:12:15.835 --> 01:12:22.009
You have to get me my pencils
and drawings, you have to.

01:12:22.176 --> 01:12:24.678
- But...
- Just do it!

01:12:28.557 --> 01:12:29.725
And as soon as you're better...

01:12:29.975 --> 01:12:32.186
I'm going to take us all down
to Devon for a little holiday.

01:12:33.896 --> 01:12:35.315
Hey, are you listening to me?

01:12:36.733 --> 01:12:37.943
Look at me darling.

01:12:40.028 --> 01:12:43.198
That's better, I was beginning
to think I was invisible.

01:12:44.116 --> 01:12:46.952
You don't have to be
invisible to disappear, dad.

01:12:48.496 --> 01:12:51.040
Anna, you said you wanted
to go to the seaside, no?

01:12:51.791 --> 01:12:52.792
Sounds wonderful mum.

01:12:53.543 --> 01:12:55.002
Hey and don't forget
your riding lessons.

01:12:55.712 --> 01:12:57.630
I've taken time off,
we can go together if you like.

01:12:58.631 --> 01:12:59.966
And then you'll go away again.

01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:05.514
I don't know what you want
these for but here they are.

01:13:07.808 --> 01:13:11.228
She shouldn't have told you,
I told Sarah to keep it a secret.

01:13:12.146 --> 01:13:13.439
- Can I see?
- No.

01:13:17.152 --> 01:13:18.570
I wouldn't want to live if he died.

01:13:56.611 --> 01:13:58.988
Now if there's anything
we need we'll be alright.

01:14:07.748 --> 01:14:09.541
Mark, Mark.

01:14:17.216 --> 01:14:18.175
Anna.

01:14:21.721 --> 01:14:22.472
Wait there.

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.023
How's that then eh?

01:14:32.316 --> 01:14:33.442
I thought you weren't ever coming back.

01:14:33.609 --> 01:14:34.610
Come on, there's lots to show you...

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.612
You've really kitted out
the place good this time.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.077
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Nothing, just pleased to see you.

01:14:44.412 --> 01:14:45.914
Come on, 
let's walk along the cliffs.

01:14:54.798 --> 01:14:55.966
Here, I want to show you something.

01:14:58.009 --> 01:14:59.512
- Can you do rollovers?
- Yeah.

01:15:00.263 --> 01:15:03.516
You haven't done them properly
until you've done them here, my way.

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:05.226
What do you mean "your way"?

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.519
Sit in front of me.

01:15:08.312 --> 01:15:11.149
Keep your head well in and
imagine you're half of a wheel.

01:15:12.818 --> 01:15:13.777
Now pull me.

01:15:33.214 --> 01:15:33.840
Again!

01:15:37.052 --> 01:15:38.929
How am I getting on 
in your world?

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.477
You're recovering
but not as fast as here.

01:15:45.519 --> 01:15:48.064
- So i'm different here?
- Don't know.

01:15:48.981 --> 01:15:52.611
I don't care what happens to me there,
as long as I can be here with you.

01:15:53.653 --> 01:15:57.157
You see, your world doesn't
matter any more, we can live here.

01:16:00.285 --> 01:16:01.578
Have you ever kissed anyone?

01:16:03.205 --> 01:16:03.956
Me neither.

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.142
Is this snogging?

01:16:38.743 --> 01:16:42.414
I've walked as far as I can along
these cliffs but there's no way down.

01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:47.378
- We should draw a ladder then.
- There's not one long enough...

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:50.131
And even if there was I wouldn't
go down there, would you?

01:16:50.381 --> 01:16:52.800
I know i'm getting better
but that's just stupidity.

01:16:54.593 --> 01:16:57.431
- You suggest something then?
- Helicopter?

01:16:58.432 --> 01:17:01.518
- I don't think I can draw that.
- I can.

01:17:09.777 --> 01:17:13.698
I brought it with me this time.
You draw the helicopter.

01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:17.285
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.164
- Do you think it'll work for me?
- Don't know.

01:17:25.836 --> 01:17:27.671
- Where are you going?
- I'm going back to draw.

01:17:27.921 --> 01:17:28.672
Wait.

01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:31.341
You can't go yet.

01:17:36.723 --> 01:17:38.808
Well you wait down here
and keep a look out for it.

01:17:39.476 --> 01:17:41.186
I can see better from up there.

01:17:41.978 --> 01:17:46.483
To be honest i'd rather draw by myself,
I don't like people watching me.

01:17:47.818 --> 01:17:51.155
- And I never saw you draw did I?
- I suppose not.

01:17:52.114 --> 01:17:54.784
- You wait down here then.
- Ok.

01:18:04.795 --> 01:18:06.797
Don't go without me.

01:18:17.308 --> 01:18:18.810
Please don't go without me.

01:19:29.177 --> 01:19:30.303
I've got some good news...

01:19:31.763 --> 01:19:35.434
They've given me a job at head office
so I don't have to go away anymore.

01:19:36.977 --> 01:19:37.936
That's good isn't it?

01:19:38.979 --> 01:19:40.731
We can all be together
like a proper family.

01:19:48.323 --> 01:19:51.284
Things aren't the same between you
and me since I got back, are they?

01:19:53.703 --> 01:19:56.956
I missed you when I was away but now
I feel as if i'm missing you even more.

01:20:00.753 --> 01:20:01.754
I'm worried.

01:20:05.883 --> 01:20:08.886
- I went to see your doctor.
- Why?

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:14.393
Mum said you were having bad
dreams about me, is that true?

01:20:19.022 --> 01:20:20.857
Do you want to see
someone about the dreams?

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:24.821
- I don't have them anymore.
- Maybe because i'm back.

01:20:25.071 --> 01:20:26.948
No, it's nothing to do with you.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.286
What did Dr Nichols say?

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.876
She said you knew a
patient of hers who died.

01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:42.381
What's the matter?

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.719
Mark's dead.

01:20:53.476 --> 01:20:54.436
Didn't you know?

01:20:58.481 --> 01:21:01.985
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry...

01:21:02.944 --> 01:21:08.159
I knew, it's just when I last saw
him I sort of hoped he'd get better.

01:21:11.328 --> 01:21:12.580
Was he a close friend?

01:21:18.754 --> 01:21:22.257
- Dr Nichols didn't tell me
the whole story. - Obviously.

01:21:24.426 --> 01:21:26.052
Mark would hate
anybody being sorry.

01:22:27.702 --> 01:22:28.453
Come on Anna.

01:22:29.538 --> 01:22:30.997
Did you seen those boats there?

01:22:32.999 --> 01:22:34.669
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr Madden.

01:22:50.686 --> 01:22:52.062
Hello, is everything ok?

01:22:55.774 --> 01:22:56.692
That's good.

01:22:59.194 --> 01:23:01.698
After lunch we'll go for
a walk down to the front.

01:23:06.995 --> 01:23:09.831
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:23:12.792 --> 01:23:14.170
Don't lose it.

01:23:17.047 --> 01:23:17.882
Dad.

01:23:22.344 --> 01:23:23.345
I'm sorry.

01:23:41.199 --> 01:23:44.869
- What on earth for?
- Being so miserable.

01:23:47.205 --> 01:23:48.081
Don't be stupid.

01:23:48.539 --> 01:23:52.251
It was the illness, when I was
ill I thought I saw funny things.

01:23:58.425 --> 01:24:03.555
I want to go to the pier...
to get Karen some rock.

01:24:07.811 --> 01:24:10.313
- Well we'll go after we've eaten.
- Good.

01:24:15.026 --> 01:24:18.196
- Shall I open your curtains.
- Whatever you like.

01:24:25.037 --> 01:24:26.372
Be careful you don't 
get sunstroke.

01:25:41.411 --> 01:25:43.705
Mark, i'm back.

01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:00.515
Mark.

01:26:05.479 --> 01:26:07.689
Mark, let me in.

01:26:12.152 --> 01:26:12.986
Mark.

01:26:19.077 --> 01:26:19.911
Mark.

01:26:23.206 --> 01:26:24.457
Mark, let me in.

01:26:27.085 --> 01:26:27.919
Let me in.

01:27:15.179 --> 01:27:19.391
I don't want to go without you but the
helicopter's been hovering all day.

01:27:20.559 --> 01:27:21.728
I think i'm meant to go.

01:27:24.481 --> 01:27:29.235
Wait for me here, i'll come
back for you, love Mark.

01:28:24.086 --> 01:28:28.091
Mark, Mark, Mark!

01:28:42.857 --> 01:28:44.150
Anna!

01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:54.077
Move back from the
edge, it's dangerous.

01:28:56.872 --> 01:28:58.415
- I can't reach.

01:28:59.207 --> 01:29:04.004
Move back from the
edge Anna, it's dangerous.

01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:06.924
- Anna, move away!
- I can't reach.

01:29:08.968 --> 01:29:12.388
Mark, I can't reach, 
don't leave me.

01:29:13.264 --> 01:29:16.100
- Anna, it's dangerous.
- I can't reach.

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:20.022
- Move away from the edge.
- Don't leave me.

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:26.236
- Bye Anna.
- No!

01:29:37.707 --> 01:29:40.710
He's alright now mum, 
I know he is.
