WEBVTT

00:04.830 --> 00:07.268
So how do you guys
like the new wheels?

00:07.311 --> 00:09.052
I can't believe I'm saying this,

00:09.096 --> 00:10.749
but your car was cooler.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.230
I think I found a quarter
under the backseat.

00:13.274 --> 00:16.015
You see? Our luck
is changing already.

00:16.059 --> 00:19.323
Are you sure about that?

00:19.367 --> 00:20.672
Do you think he's following us?

00:20.716 --> 00:22.979
Oh, god. God.
Get down.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.589
I thought you said we were safe.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.331
This is all your fault.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.769
What's he doing?
Is he pulling us over?

00:30.813 --> 00:32.206
Nothing, it's okay.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.642
I can't believe
this is happening.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.472
Oh, my god.
How could you get us into this?

00:38.777 --> 00:40.431
Stay down.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:50.789 --> 00:52.965
Everybody, quiet.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.967
Well, first of all, I'd love to

00:55.011 --> 00:56.839
thank all of you
wonderful people,

00:56.882 --> 00:58.623
family and friends,
for coming here to help us

00:58.667 --> 01:00.364
celebrate our tenth anniversary.

01:02.192 --> 01:03.715
Thank you.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.369
Well, where do I start?

01:05.413 --> 01:07.458
It was 11 years ago,

01:07.502 --> 01:10.679
I was just a...
good ol' beat cop.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.246
And this young lady

01:12.289 --> 01:15.814
came zooming by me
at 67... in a 30.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.079
Speed demon.
That is no joke, my friends.

01:19.122 --> 01:22.256
I think it was 45.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.910
Year later, we got hitched.
Aw.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.216
Then Charlie came,

01:26.260 --> 01:27.478
and then I started law school

01:27.522 --> 01:29.437
and, well...

01:29.480 --> 01:31.569
the rest is history,
and now look at me.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.397
I noticed you weren't
really part of that story.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.399
What more could I ask for?
Yeah, well it's not a fairytale

01:35.443 --> 01:37.532
if the "little lady"
is a single mom.

01:37.575 --> 01:40.143
Everybody, raise your glass.
This toast is to you, my love.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.580
To the most beautiful person
in the world.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.539
Happy anniversary.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.236
L'chaim!

01:46.280 --> 01:48.934
Congratulations!

01:48.978 --> 01:51.154
Yeah, we just had the
entire place remodeled.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.373
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.114
This picture come with
the frame?

01:54.157 --> 01:55.419
It's the perfect family.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.378
Oh, stop.

01:57.421 --> 02:00.076
Aw, look at Charlie.
So grown up.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.513
Oh, he's so cute.
How's he liking camp?

02:02.557 --> 02:05.168
He loves it.
I don't think he wants to leave.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.822
Well, I don't blame him.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.737
I know. Me neither.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.520
Well, I hope he's
getting some sleep.

02:10.565 --> 02:13.481
Seriously, this
family is just perfect.

02:13.524 --> 02:16.048
Oh, picture perfect.
Mom, where's the bottle opener?

02:16.092 --> 02:17.441
It's in the kitchen,
in the drawer.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.661
If it was there,
I wouldn't be asking.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.097
Okay, well I'll come
help you find it.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.664
In just a sec, okay?

02:22.707 --> 02:25.188
She looks great. Looks like
she got her mom's figure.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.972
Well, I will take that
as a compliment.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.931
Thank you very much.
It is.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.151
Amazing spread tonight, Darren.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.327
Erin really outdid herself.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.765
Well, Erin doesn't work.
She takes care of the home.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.159
You really keep her on a
pretty tight leash, huh? Yeah.

02:39.202 --> 02:41.639
Yeah, you would too
if your wife looked like that.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.206
What are you
trying to say, Gary?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.904
What? Nothing, I was just...

02:45.948 --> 02:47.776
What, objectifying my wife?

02:51.388 --> 02:53.695
I'm just kidding, man.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.349
Jesus, wow!
Okay.

02:55.392 --> 02:56.959
This guy.
I had you guys.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.830
Truth is, look...

02:58.874 --> 03:00.397
Erin, she's...

03:01.746 --> 03:03.357
she's not a risk taker.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.316
Okay? She would not
thrive in the work place.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.100
She's too naive.

03:08.144 --> 03:09.406
She's better at home.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.453
Thank you.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.802
Hey there, guys.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.586
Hi!
Hey, Frida, how are you?

03:15.630 --> 03:16.935
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.676
Nancy, nice to see you.
Darren, how are you?

03:18.720 --> 03:20.330
Good. Why didn't she
wear the dress I bought her?

03:20.374 --> 03:22.245
Darren, you know, girls her age

03:22.289 --> 03:25.161
like to make
their own fashion choices.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.989
Do you mind if I steal
my wife for a second?

03:27.032 --> 03:28.991
Not at all.
Oh, and Erin,

03:29.034 --> 03:31.080
if you still want to talk about the
real estate exam, just call me.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.386
Okay, thank you.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.977
What is this?

03:59.021 --> 04:00.675
I thought we talked about that.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.678
What?

04:06.071 --> 04:08.900
It's a party, Darren.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.338
I don't care.
I told you no red lipstick.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.386
I know, I'm sorry.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.259
Your daughter can dress
like trash, but you...

04:19.302 --> 04:20.608
you're my wife.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.828
We have an image to uphold.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.179
Got it?

04:36.363 --> 04:38.103
Mm!

04:43.108 --> 04:44.980
I love you.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.547
I love you, too.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.092
What's wrong?

05:10.135 --> 05:11.354
I feel like someone's there.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.008
It's nothing, come here.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.842
Hey, Jake.
You guys having fun?

05:20.885 --> 05:22.234
What are you doing?

05:22.278 --> 05:23.845
Me? Uh...

05:23.888 --> 05:25.499
It's my property.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.849
My house, my pool.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.242
That's my chair.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.247
I think it's time for you
to say good night.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.251
I'll text you.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.565
I'm disappointed in you.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.698
You're not my dad.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.278
'Cause I caught her
practically having sex

06:06.322 --> 06:07.758
with the kid out there
in the back porch.

06:07.802 --> 06:10.457
Is that how you taught her
how to express herself?

06:13.938 --> 06:15.113
Darren...

06:17.072 --> 06:19.857
we need...
help.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.381
Okay?

06:22.686 --> 06:24.209
We need to talk to somebody.

06:24.253 --> 06:29.127
Just... Would you stop with
the... damn couples therapy?

06:30.651 --> 06:32.217
"Till death do us part."

06:33.393 --> 06:35.046
Right?

06:36.526 --> 06:38.093
Right, babe.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.144
Where is your coat?

06:46.188 --> 06:47.494
I left it in my locker.

06:47.537 --> 06:48.930
Can I drive?

06:48.973 --> 06:50.322
Not in this weather.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.369
I just drove in this weather.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.066
That's what your driver's ed
is for, honey.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.807
Oh, my god.

06:56.851 --> 06:59.419
Darren's right,
you are afraid to take risks.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.857
When did he say that?

07:02.900 --> 07:04.728
When didn't he?

07:07.601 --> 07:09.864
If something happened
last night, you can tell me.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.343
Nothing happened.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.562
He kicked Jake out
because he hates him.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.042
He doesn't hate Jake.

07:14.085 --> 07:17.437
He was just... He was just
upset about the dress.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.048
Well, no one asked him
to buy me an ugly yellow dress.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.484
I'm not ten.

07:23.965 --> 07:27.185
You know what, I just...

07:27.229 --> 07:30.319
When things aren't working,
sometimes you have to consider...

07:30.362 --> 07:32.190
the alternative.

07:32.234 --> 07:33.844
What are you talking about?

07:36.412 --> 07:40.416
Darren and I have been together
for almost 11 years, and...

07:40.460 --> 07:42.462
people change.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.508
Are you leaving him?

07:45.552 --> 07:48.772
No. No, that's...

07:48.816 --> 07:51.383
Mom! I am in my senior year
of high school

07:51.427 --> 07:53.255
and I finally have a boyfriend.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.517
And you just want
to mess that all up?

07:54.561 --> 07:56.432
I don't want
to mess everything up.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.913
There are just things
that you don't know.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.697
Don't touch me.
You don't know.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.265
I hate Darren, but I do not want
to go back to the way things were.

08:03.308 --> 08:04.919
I like my life
the way it is right now.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.355
I know, I know.
Don't touch me!

08:06.398 --> 08:07.530
It's okay.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.101
I'm sorry I said anything.

08:14.232 --> 08:15.582
Everything's fine.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.931
Just forget
I said anything, all right?

08:19.847 --> 08:21.675
You spent over $500 at the mall.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.286
On what?

08:24.329 --> 08:26.897
Charlie needed
some stuff for camp.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.247
Sleeping bag, clothes.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.684
That wasn't $500.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.424
What else did you buy?

08:33.774 --> 08:34.948
What else did you buy?

08:34.991 --> 08:36.341
Nothing.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.865
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where... where you going?

08:37.908 --> 08:38.996
We're having a conversation.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.695
You're interrogating me.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.434
I'm not interrogating you.

08:43.479 --> 08:44.654
I'm just asking
you what you bought.

08:44.698 --> 08:45.568
Just tell me what you bought.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.180
A dress, okay?
I bought a dress.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.442
Ah, where is it?
Let me see it.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.096
Why?

08:52.140 --> 08:54.795
Why? Because it's my money
and I want to see what I bought.

08:57.493 --> 08:58.842
You already saw it.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.323
Last night, at the party.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.020
Amy wore it.
I bought her a dress.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.283
So, I...
I paid for two dresses?

09:05.327 --> 09:06.850
I just didn't want
her to be embarrassed.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.287
Oh, so now I'm...
I embarrass her.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.898
That is not what I said.
So you and your daughter

09:10.941 --> 09:13.117
deliberately disobeyed me.
You went behind my back,

09:13.161 --> 09:14.641
you made me look like

09:14.684 --> 09:18.296
an absolute fool
in my house with my friends

09:18.340 --> 09:20.255
and now you spend my money?
Don't... Darren, I'm sorry!

09:20.298 --> 09:21.648
I'm sorry! You're hurting me!

09:21.691 --> 09:23.563
Ah!

09:25.477 --> 09:29.220
Now look what you've done.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.570
I'll call the police.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.484
And who are they
gonna believe, huh?

09:32.528 --> 09:34.661
A respected D.A.
or his gold-digging wife?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.800
Stop being so dramatic.

09:51.852 --> 09:55.159
Don't go back to California, I miss you.
I know, I know. I miss you too.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.335
You look amazing.
Oh, stop it.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.294
You look amazing.
Thank you.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.252
Well, except for that... that
Frankenstein thing on your forehead.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.514
Oh.
What... what is that?

10:02.558 --> 10:04.038
No. I just...
I tripped...

10:04.081 --> 10:06.127
on Charlie's toys.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.608
You're such a klutz.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.872
I know. So, anyway, tell me about Italy.
How was it?

10:11.915 --> 10:14.439
It was awesome.
The food was amazing,

10:14.483 --> 10:16.311
the fashion was, like,

10:16.354 --> 10:17.617
to die...
The men?

10:17.660 --> 10:19.662
The men were, uh...

10:19.706 --> 10:21.533
they were kind of cheesy.

10:21.577 --> 10:23.361
Super cheesy, right? I know.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.191
Oh, oh, speaking of...

10:27.235 --> 10:30.673
No.
It's just one of those Amber Alerts.

10:30.717 --> 10:34.677
That's a bummer.
Anyway... uh, how is Darren?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.853
He is good. Yeah.
Mm-hmm?

10:36.897 --> 10:38.507
Um, you know, he's just...

10:38.550 --> 10:40.552
gearing up for the campaign.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.598
He's just really...

10:42.642 --> 10:45.819
He's busy with work,
and... yeah.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.604
What's wrong?

10:48.648 --> 10:52.129
Nothing. What?
Nothing.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.783
I'm just...

10:53.827 --> 10:57.831
you know, it's just, uh...
Just some personal stuff.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.964
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
I was your best friend.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.400
I thought we told
each other personal things.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.925
I know, I totally know that.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.578
Let's talk about
your trip and...

11:06.622 --> 11:07.928
You only have one day here.

11:11.496 --> 11:12.976
Did he hit you?

11:13.020 --> 11:15.283
No. No, no, no.

11:15.326 --> 11:17.981
No, we had
an argument and I fell.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.722
Oh, my god, Erin.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.202
He hit you.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.465
He didn't. Okay?
Just drop it. Just drop it.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.858
Are you lying to me right now?

11:24.901 --> 11:27.164
Let's, uh...
Let's talk about Italy. Come on.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.907
Okay, whatever.
Listen, fine.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.996
But listen to me, okay?

11:33.040 --> 11:36.608
If you or those kids
are ever in danger,

11:36.652 --> 11:37.958
I want you to come
straight to California,

11:38.001 --> 11:39.437
do you hear me?

11:39.481 --> 11:41.701
Look, we're living
on Jason's boat now.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.051
It's awesome, it's beautiful.
The kids would love it there.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.749
Anytime. Promise me?

11:46.793 --> 11:48.446
Everything's fine.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.406
Okay? Really.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.929
Okay.
Okay?

12:22.480 --> 12:23.699
How was your day?

12:25.048 --> 12:26.746
It was good.
You know, just the usual.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.530
Errands, shopping.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.098
That's it.

12:32.403 --> 12:33.491
Yeah.

12:35.450 --> 12:36.973
You forgetting anything?

12:38.888 --> 12:40.150
No.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.954
Since when do you drink coffee?

13:02.956 --> 13:05.175
So, what? Are we digging
through the trash now, Darren?

13:05.219 --> 13:06.394
Answer the question.

13:08.222 --> 13:11.355
My friend wanted to have coffee.
I had lunch with my friend.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.922
Really? Which friend?

13:12.966 --> 13:14.489
Does that really matter?

13:14.532 --> 13:15.533
Was it a man?

13:16.926 --> 13:18.536
You think I'm having an affair?

13:18.580 --> 13:20.582
Just answer
the ...damn question.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.931
I had lunch
with my friend, Darren.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.193
That's all.

13:25.543 --> 13:29.896
You know, in my business, you
just created reasonable doubt.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.898
I mean, the jury was willing
to go along with your story,

13:31.941 --> 13:35.423
but by refusing to answer
a simple question...

13:35.466 --> 13:37.033
you create doubt.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.864
Well, this is our kitchen,
not a courtroom.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.997
Did you have lunch
with another man?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.868
Yes or no?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.870
All you need to know is that I
had lunch with a friend, Darren.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.350
Oh, with a friend.
Get off me!

13:49.393 --> 13:50.873
Is that how you taught Amy
how to be a slut?

13:50.917 --> 13:53.354
No, who told you that?

13:53.397 --> 13:55.269
That's just not true.
You're hurting me, stop it!

13:55.312 --> 13:57.837
Hey, Jake, sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.316
What's going on?

13:59.360 --> 14:01.884
Your mother dropped a plate.
Go back to your room.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.712
Maybe I don't want to.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.583
Disrespectful little bitch.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.368
Don't use that tone with her.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.283
This is my house. I'll use
whatever tone I want to.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.762
I'm out of here.

14:10.806 --> 14:11.981
Yeah, go.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.592
Okay. That is it.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.464
I am done with this marriage.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.118
You're not going anywhere.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.684
If you ever try to leave me,

14:19.728 --> 14:20.816
I will bury you

14:20.860 --> 14:21.861
and your daughter.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.734
"Till death do us part,"
remember?

14:25.777 --> 14:26.953
Mm.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.133
I'm going to bed.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.812
Good morning.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.205
Morning.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.556
I didn't see Amy this morning.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.472
Oh, she stayed at Abby's.
She texted me.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.083
Hm, okay.

15:10.126 --> 15:14.522
Hey, I'm sorry, uh...

15:14.565 --> 15:16.741
I should have told you
this last night but...

15:16.785 --> 15:19.744
it was Frida
that I had lunch with.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.312
I wanted to talk to her
about the real estate exam

15:22.356 --> 15:24.401
and I know that
you don't want me to work

15:24.445 --> 15:26.838
but I just thought it couldn't
hurt to hear her out.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.754
It's okay.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.150
Have a good day, okay?

15:54.779 --> 15:55.867
Hello?

15:55.911 --> 15:57.652
Frida, it's Darren Lattimer.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.349
Hey, how are you?
Hi, there.

15:59.393 --> 16:02.004
Hey, listen, I'm actually
calling about my wife, Erin.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.919
I know you guys had
lunch yesterday and you were...

16:03.963 --> 16:06.313
Actually, we...
we didn't have lunch.

16:06.356 --> 16:09.272
You didn't? Oh.
I... I thought...

16:09.316 --> 16:10.839
You know what?

16:10.882 --> 16:12.275
I think I got mixed up.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.843
I'm... I'm really sorry
to bother you.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.323
It's totally okay.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.629
Sorry I couldn't help.
Great. Have a great day.

16:18.673 --> 16:19.979
You too. Bye.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.052
Hey, Mrs. Lattimer.
How are you?

19:01.096 --> 19:02.315
Hi.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.664
You're here early this month.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.406
Yeah, um, Charlie is away
at summer camp.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.843
Oh.
And he's been a little low this month,

19:08.886 --> 19:10.714
so I just want to make sure
he's got enough Glucagon.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.500
Maybe like five...
five shots.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.155
Well, unfortunately your shipment
doesn't come in until the first.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.201
Okay. Maybe... Maybe you've
got some in the back?

19:19.245 --> 19:22.770
Maybe you could just check and see
if there's any samples or anything?

19:22.813 --> 19:24.685
Let me see what I have.

19:24.728 --> 19:25.947
Okay, thanks.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.634
I have two.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.551
I'll just add this to your account.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.641
Mrs. Lattimer?

20:07.684 --> 20:10.078
Oh. Thank you,
I appreciate it.

20:20.523 --> 20:21.916
Excuse me.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.091
Yeah?

20:23.134 --> 20:24.962
Do you have these
in 1,000 minutes?

20:25.006 --> 20:27.095
Um, let me go check in the back.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.227
Thank you.

20:32.883 --> 20:35.756
Erin? Erin?

20:37.932 --> 20:39.150
Erin?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.892
Oh, Gary.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.024
Hey.
Hey!

20:43.067 --> 20:44.678
How are you?
I'm good.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.462
Yeah, we didn't have
any more in the back,

20:46.506 --> 20:49.291
but did you want me to
ring you up with that one?

20:49.335 --> 20:51.206
You know what? You could just...
You could put it on my bill.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.512
Okay.
Thank you.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.036
You buying a burner phone?

20:55.079 --> 20:58.779
No. Well, actually,
it's for my... it's for Charlie.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.389
He's at summer camp.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.783
And he just...
He's so homesick.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.698
Ah, I know that feeling
all too well.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.395
Right?

21:06.439 --> 21:08.179
Hey, do me a favor and don't
say anything to Darren.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.616
Just 'cause
I don't want him to worry.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.575
It'll be our little secret.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.795
Thank you.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.100
All right, see you later, Gary.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.061
Amy, why aren't you
picking up my... call?

21:32.508 --> 21:34.554
Come on, baby.
Answer the phone.

21:34.597 --> 21:35.903
This is Amy, who's this?

21:35.946 --> 21:37.644
The woman who gave birth to you.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.472
Mom? What number is this?

21:39.515 --> 21:41.604
That's nice that you won't pick
up the phone for your own mother,

21:41.648 --> 21:43.389
but you'll answer
for a complete stranger.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.521
Well, if it's so important
just text me.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.306
Listen, I gotta tell you
some things in person.

21:47.349 --> 21:48.785
I'm gonna be over
at Abby's in ten minutes.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.440
Amy?

21:53.834 --> 21:55.531
I'm at Jake's.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.324
I'll call you later.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.722
Don't be mad at me.

22:12.766 --> 22:13.941
I'm not, just get in the car.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.344
Nothing happened.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.128
If you're wondering.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.086
His parents are, like,
really old school.

22:29.130 --> 22:31.045
They had us sleep
in separate rooms.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.351
We'll talk about it later.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.180
You just missed our turn.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.574
Where are we going?

22:38.618 --> 22:41.142
As far away as possible.

22:52.632 --> 22:53.807
Oh.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.984
You little...

23:06.733 --> 23:09.736
Confirmed.
Hello, Mr. Darren Lattimer.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.042
Please say one
for account information,

23:12.086 --> 23:14.044
two for account balance.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.438
Two.
Three for...

23:16.482 --> 23:23.097
Would you like to hear the balance
of account number 2974-9872-3489?

23:23.140 --> 23:25.099
Please press one to confirm.

23:29.756 --> 23:32.933
Your account balance is zero
dollars and zero cents.

23:53.519 --> 23:57.044
Why can't you just get a
divorce like a normal couple?

23:57.087 --> 23:58.828
Yesterday, you didn't want
us to split up.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.830
That was before you abducted me.

24:00.874 --> 24:03.964
Amy...

24:04.007 --> 24:06.532
It's between Darren and I. There's a
lot of stuff that you don't know.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.359
That's because you don't
talk to me about anything.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.449
I am your mother!

24:10.492 --> 24:13.452
I will tell you what you need to
know when you need to know it.

24:13.495 --> 24:15.236
So what's the plan here?

24:15.279 --> 24:17.586
Are we gonna hold hands
and drive off a cliff?

24:17.630 --> 24:21.198
We're gonna go get Charlie and then we're
gonna stay with Stacy for a little while.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.852
In Italy?
She's in California.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.985
Oh, it's Darren.

24:25.028 --> 24:26.769
You want me to tell him
you're kidnapping us.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.035
Are you insane?

24:32.079 --> 24:34.124
Did you just throw my phone
out the window?

24:34.168 --> 24:35.909
Darren installed
a tracking device on your phone.

24:35.952 --> 24:37.867
He uploaded it months ago.

24:39.260 --> 24:40.827
You've been tracking me?

24:40.870 --> 24:42.742
Not me. Him.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.700
If it makes you feel any
better, he did it to me too.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.181
It doesn't.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.201
His favorite
pajamas are missing.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.421
I thought you told me
he was at camp.

25:10.465 --> 25:11.901
Yeah, he didn't take them.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.468
Okay? But there's plenty
of other things missing.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.339
Even toys.

25:15.383 --> 25:18.821
So neither she nor your step-daughter
are answering their phones?

25:18.865 --> 25:20.867
I installed a tracker
on their phones,

25:20.910 --> 25:22.695
but it's on my computer.

25:22.738 --> 25:24.566
And she changed the password.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.569
So, we have the little missus,
packs stuff and takes off.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.745
Is there any reason why?

25:31.573 --> 25:34.097
What are you saying?
What happened to your hand?

25:35.795 --> 25:38.449
It's an accident, Lou.
What are you getting at?

25:38.493 --> 25:39.886
You know what?
Forget that.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.366
I'm a public figure,

25:42.410 --> 25:45.282
and I can't have my own wife
clearing out our joint bank account.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.981
Now she takes the kids?

25:48.024 --> 25:50.549
This is spousal child abduction.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.507
I need you to help me!

25:52.551 --> 25:57.033
Darren, there's no
custody battle going on here.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.687
She's allowed to take
the kids on a trip.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.041
Is this about Martinez?

26:05.085 --> 26:06.652
What?

26:06.695 --> 26:08.436
What are you talking about?

26:08.479 --> 26:10.960
That case was closed
two years ago.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.483
She doesn't know
anything about that.

26:12.527 --> 26:13.615
Are you sure?

26:14.790 --> 26:15.922
Lou, I think I know my wife.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.840
All right.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.844
I want an Amber Alert.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.108
You know the rules.

26:28.151 --> 26:31.633
That can only be issued if
there is a threat of violence.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.156
Then I need
to show you something.

26:34.549 --> 26:35.985
Come on.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.603
She took the gun.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.430
Does anybody else have
the combo besides you or her?

26:46.474 --> 26:47.649
No, no one.

26:49.085 --> 26:51.000
I didn't say anything
because I...

26:52.436 --> 26:53.437
She's my wife, Lou.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.397
But now she's got a loaded gun.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.529
Yeah. It's my fault, too.

26:58.573 --> 27:01.271
I should have been more careful, I
should have hid it in a different place,

27:01.315 --> 27:02.533
safer place.

27:02.577 --> 27:05.275
Nah, you can't blame yourself.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.973
How are you supposed to know
she'd do something like this?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.280
I just want my family back.

27:12.326 --> 27:13.632
Gotta help me, Lou.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.345
Stay right here,
it's not gonna take long.

27:48.492 --> 27:51.060
Hi.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.932
Hi.
I'm Erin Lattimer.

27:52.975 --> 27:55.021
My son, Charlie,
is a camper here.

27:55.064 --> 27:56.718
I brought him
some medicine from home.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.938
Do you just want to leave
the medicine here with me?

27:58.981 --> 28:01.375
Sure. Um, actually,
it's in the car.

28:01.418 --> 28:04.595
You know what? I would love
to say hi to my baby boy.

28:04.639 --> 28:07.860
Oh, yeah. Okay, well, all the campers
are in the dining hall right now

28:07.903 --> 28:09.470
so I'll have to go get him.

28:09.513 --> 28:10.776
Okay. I'll just wait.
All right. Yeah.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.647
Great. And it's, uh... Charlie?

28:12.691 --> 28:13.866
Charlie Lattimer.
Charlie Lattimer.

28:34.277 --> 28:35.844
Mom!

28:37.324 --> 28:40.762
Charlie! Baby!

28:40.806 --> 28:42.851
What are you doing here?
I brought you your medicine.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.288
And a care package.
It's in the car.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.073
Do you mind?
Yeah. Sure, just, uh...

28:47.116 --> 28:48.683
meet me back in the office.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.076
Cool. Thank you.
Okay.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.773
Quickly, baby.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.644
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

28:54.994 --> 28:56.299
This is Barney.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.218
Erin Lattimer?

29:06.396 --> 29:07.876
Oh, god.

29:07.920 --> 29:11.793
Mrs. Lattimer! Erin! No!

29:11.837 --> 29:12.794
Stop!

29:22.499 --> 29:24.327
Erin! Don't you dare!

29:24.371 --> 29:25.285
Wait! Erin!

29:26.677 --> 29:28.897
No! No, no, no, stop! Erin!

29:28.941 --> 29:31.247
Erin! Don't you dare!

29:31.291 --> 29:32.553
Erin!

29:32.596 --> 29:34.163
Stop!

29:37.079 --> 29:38.559
He put an Amber
Alert on us, Mom.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.343
What?!
You know how embarrassing this is for me?

29:40.387 --> 29:41.867
My friends are gonna see this.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.259
What's an Amber Alert?

29:43.303 --> 29:44.521
It means Mom's kidnapping us.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.175
Amy!
What? He deserves to know.

29:46.219 --> 29:48.047
Everybody else does.
We're going on a vacation.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.178
Can you at least drive normal?

29:49.222 --> 29:50.658
You're gonna get us killed.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.094
I wanna go home.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.835
We can't go home
right now, honey, okay?

29:53.879 --> 29:55.794
Put your seatbelt on.
Mommy thinks your daddy's a psycho!

29:55.837 --> 29:57.143
Amy!

29:57.186 --> 29:58.666
You are not helping!

29:58.709 --> 30:00.929
What's a psycho?

30:00.973 --> 30:02.539
Your daddy's not well
right now, honey, okay?

30:06.239 --> 30:08.676
How much longer?
Another hour.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.721
I don't know, maybe. You got a
lot of security on this thing.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.724
Darren.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.207
I just got off the phone with the
head counselor for the camp.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.384
And?

30:22.908 --> 30:24.561
Erin took Charlie.

30:38.445 --> 30:42.144
Okay, I'm gonna pick up some
snacks and some waters, Charlie.

30:42.188 --> 30:44.625
I need you to check your blood sugar, okay?
Okay.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.583
Where are we gonna
stay tonight, Mom?

30:46.627 --> 30:47.846
We can't just keep driving.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.804
I'm gonna figure
that out, alright?

30:49.848 --> 30:52.546
You just stay put
and help your brother.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.857
Do you need my help?
No.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.249
Good. I have to pee.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.685
Mom said to wait here.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.600
I'll be right back.

31:41.595 --> 31:42.944
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am,
are you okay?

31:44.685 --> 31:48.558
Oh my God! Did I really
get all this energy drink?

31:48.602 --> 31:51.213
God, when you see it all laid
out on the ground like that.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.823
I'm Wes, by the...

31:54.477 --> 31:55.609
Nice to meet you, too.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.963
Where's your sister?

32:02.007 --> 32:03.095
Bathroom.

32:05.053 --> 32:07.447
What's that, Mommy?

32:07.490 --> 32:09.014
It's nothing, sweetheart.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.059
Hey! Did you check your levels?
Uh-huh.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.629
Oh my God.

32:15.672 --> 32:19.241
Hi, Officer, is there a problem?

32:19.285 --> 32:21.591
Could you please back
your car up a couple of feet?

32:22.723 --> 32:24.986
I need to get to the gas pump.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.901
Oh!

32:26.945 --> 32:28.598
Yes, I am so sorry.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.992
Yes, we are actually just leaving.
Alright.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.863
Have a good night.
You too.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.826
Get in the car right now.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.002
Why did you leave your brother?
I told you not to!

32:41.046 --> 32:43.091
Why would you kidnap us?

32:43.135 --> 32:45.964
So, the camp is at an
intersection of two highways.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.314
She could've went in
four different directions.

32:48.357 --> 32:51.143
Any ideas?
Why don't we just throw a dart at a map?

32:51.186 --> 32:52.883
Would that help?

32:52.927 --> 32:54.537
You think she would've
went out of the country?

32:54.581 --> 32:57.018
No, she would have
needed her pass...

32:57.062 --> 32:58.324
Move.
What?

33:03.024 --> 33:04.721
She took them.

33:04.765 --> 33:06.549
She took the passports!

33:06.593 --> 33:09.857
Alright, well, I'll contact the
airports and the border patrol.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.425
No, Lou.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.601
You don't understand.
She took all of 'em.

33:14.644 --> 33:15.863
Mine, too.

33:17.430 --> 33:20.041
Jesus, Darren.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.782
Your passport's the only
evidence she needs

33:21.825 --> 33:23.697
to link us to Martinez
and the cartel!

33:23.740 --> 33:26.004
Listen, I took two trips
to Juarez, okay?

33:26.047 --> 33:28.745
She thinks I went down
to Texas to visit my sister.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.660
She's not capable of putting
any of this together.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.923
She won't know anything.
Just trust me.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.360
All we have to do is find her.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.076
Don't let the name throw ya!
This baby was made in America.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.211
Is that right?
Oh, yeah, mileage king.

33:59.254 --> 34:02.997
Little bumblebee of an engine just
keeps going and going and going.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.390
You like what you see?

34:04.433 --> 34:06.261
I think I do.
How much you want?

34:07.654 --> 34:09.612
For you? Ten grand.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.962
I'm on a bit of a budget.

34:12.005 --> 34:14.748
Well, darlin',
budget's my middle name.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.271
That there's a little piece
of American history.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.058
How many miles on her?

34:21.188 --> 34:23.670
150, 160.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.933
I'll let you have it for $1,995.

34:25.976 --> 34:26.934
She gonna break down on me?

34:26.976 --> 34:28.804
Now, ma'am,

34:28.849 --> 34:32.157
all of our vehicles are inspected
by my own personal mechanic.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.114
Now, of course,
a vehicle this age

34:34.159 --> 34:35.943
may run into problems
down the line,

34:35.985 --> 34:37.945
but that is the price
of owning a classic.

34:37.987 --> 34:41.121
It's like equestrianism.
It's the sport of queens.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.601
Will you take cash?

34:42.645 --> 34:45.039
Does the pope wear a funny hat?

34:45.083 --> 34:46.996
One condition though.
No paperwork.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.958
I don't know. I can get in
a lot of trouble for that.

34:52.002 --> 34:53.264
How about an even $3,000?

34:53.308 --> 34:54.788
I can work with that.
Deal.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.532
By the way, I found a quarter
under the backseat.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.578
You see? Our luck
is changing already.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.450
Are you sure about that?

35:05.755 --> 35:07.627
Okay, duck.
Duck down.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.716
I thought you said we were safe.
We are, we are, it's fine.

35:09.759 --> 35:12.022
Just stay down.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.589
This is all your fault.
Stay down.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.506
It stinks down here!

35:19.160 --> 35:20.335
It's alright.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.165
What's he doing?

35:24.209 --> 35:25.906
Nothing. It's okay.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.342
I can't believe
this is happening.

35:29.257 --> 35:32.086
Oh my God, how could
you get us into this?

35:35.176 --> 35:36.830
Oh my God.

35:36.873 --> 35:39.485
Relax. It's alright.
It's alright.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.226
Okay, sit up.

35:41.269 --> 35:42.444
You can sit up now.

35:42.488 --> 35:43.880
It's alright.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.447
I'm not doing that again!

35:47.057 --> 35:49.364
I found another quarter!

35:49.408 --> 35:51.279
You did?
Yeah.

35:56.676 --> 35:59.896
This mattress is worse
than camp!

35:59.940 --> 36:01.985
It's only for one night.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.900
Mom! Mom, come here!

36:03.944 --> 36:05.380
What is it?

36:08.427 --> 36:10.994
It's just a cockroach.
Look how big it is.

36:11.038 --> 36:14.650
Well, it reminds me
of Mr. Ross Roacherson.

36:14.694 --> 36:17.392
Come on! From where we lived
before we met Darren.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.483
Oh my God, I forgot about that.

36:21.527 --> 36:22.876
Yeah, it was pretty crappy.

36:24.965 --> 36:26.619
We were poor, weren't we?

36:26.662 --> 36:29.535
Yeah... but we were happy.

36:31.754 --> 36:34.931
Remember we used to play Go
Fish during the daytime,

36:34.975 --> 36:37.020
and then at night,
we'd walk to the store.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.935
Oh, yeah.
Those little cups of ice cream.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.981
Mint chocolate chip,
yeah. Every time.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.157
Every time!

36:43.201 --> 36:46.116
You used to take me everywhere.

36:46.160 --> 36:50.860
Yeah, well, I needed you
to help me be an adult.

36:50.904 --> 36:53.994
I needed you... you were a
kid, but I needed you.

36:54.037 --> 36:57.171
Just as much as you needed me.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.607
We were best friends.

36:59.782 --> 37:00.957
Yeah.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.960
And we had roaches,

37:04.004 --> 37:05.701
not that big,

37:05.745 --> 37:07.137
but we had 'em.

37:07.181 --> 37:09.227
You used to name them!

37:09.270 --> 37:11.316
Hey, Charlie,
come meet Albert...

37:11.359 --> 37:13.970
Roacherstein.
Albert!

37:14.014 --> 37:16.756
Charlie, come here!
Roacherstein? Okay.

37:16.799 --> 37:17.713
Charlie, come look at the...

37:19.454 --> 37:21.413
Get the kit!

37:21.456 --> 37:23.545
Where is it?
It's in my suitcase. Stay calm.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.808
Charlie? Charlie, baby!

37:25.852 --> 37:27.767
Wake up. Here.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.986
It's not here, Mom.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.467
Are you sure you didn't leave it in the
car? No, I wouldn't have done that.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.730
Where is it? I wouldn't
have left it anywhere.

37:34.774 --> 37:36.166
Where is it?

37:36.210 --> 37:37.733
It was right here!
I can't believe you!

37:37.777 --> 37:39.909
Amy, not now.
What... what if I don't find it?

37:39.953 --> 37:41.868
Just keep looking for it, okay?

37:41.911 --> 37:43.783
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go to the car and check.

37:43.826 --> 37:45.175
Just keep him awake.
Charlie?

38:06.371 --> 38:08.416
I got it, I got it!

38:08.460 --> 38:11.680
Charlie? Hang on, baby.
Hang on, I got it, baby.

38:11.724 --> 38:13.465
Just stay with me.
Stay with me, okay?

38:13.508 --> 38:15.162
Charlie, it's coming, okay?

38:15.205 --> 38:17.599
I'm gonna help you
out right now, baby.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.340
Stay with me, baby.

38:19.384 --> 38:20.341
Here we go.

38:23.388 --> 38:24.563
We got it. Alright.

38:24.606 --> 38:26.565
Okay, baby, I need
you to wake up.

38:26.608 --> 38:29.045
Okay, I need you
to wake up, alright, baby?

38:29.089 --> 38:31.831
I need you to fight right now!

38:31.874 --> 38:33.572
I need you to wake up.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.225
Come on.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.836
Please don't do this.

38:40.622 --> 38:41.710
Baby.

38:44.365 --> 38:45.627
Mom?

38:47.020 --> 38:49.762
What happened?

38:49.805 --> 38:52.808
You had a little seizure,
baby, but you're okay now.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.984
You're okay.
Oh, thank God.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.430
I just got off the phone
with the Tulsa PD.

39:05.473 --> 39:07.693
I think we have a line on Erin.

39:07.736 --> 39:10.609
Bad news is she picked
up a car from a lot.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.873
Purchased it without paperwork
or a license plate.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.527
So, go find the car.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.050
Right.

39:22.272 --> 39:25.493
Where are you?
We're at, like, the crappiest motel ever.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.888
You heard of Motel Six?
This is like Motel Five.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.847
You know, I've been trying
to text and call you.

39:31.891 --> 39:34.415
My mom threw my
phone out the window.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.982
Wait, what? I mean, are you kidding?

39:36.025 --> 39:38.506
Yeah, she's being
really psycho right now.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.421
She basically kidnapped us.

39:40.465 --> 39:44.033
Okay, well, does she, like, have a plan?
I don't know.

39:44.077 --> 39:46.122
She said we were gonna stay with
her friend, Stacy or something,

39:46.166 --> 39:47.733
but that's, like, way far away.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.128
Jake, I gotta go.
Amy, wait, I...

39:56.916 --> 39:58.526
Wake up! Wake up, wake up.

39:58.570 --> 39:59.875
We gotta go.
The police are here.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.181
Come on, the police are here.
What?

40:01.224 --> 40:02.487
What is...

40:04.576 --> 40:06.578
Oh, sh...

40:08.188 --> 40:10.190
Charlie, get up, baby.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.321
Get up, come on.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.628
Come on, baby, let's go.

40:17.284 --> 40:19.460
Suspect is 5'10, brunette.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.157
Believed to be armed and dangerous.
Proceed with caution.

41:02.938 --> 41:05.811
What do you think?
I think it's late.

41:05.854 --> 41:08.901
They saw us coming and either hitched
a ride, or stole another vehicle.

41:08.944 --> 41:10.206
They could be a hundred
miles away by now.

41:23.219 --> 41:24.786
Well, it's official.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.527
Worst night ever.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.009
No argument here.

41:30.052 --> 41:31.532
I'm hungry.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.536
Saw a truck stop
a couple miles back.

41:37.233 --> 41:39.366
They towed our car, Mom.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.411
What are we gonna do?
Call an Uber?

41:44.676 --> 41:46.852
I spy with my little eye...

41:46.895 --> 41:49.028
something brown.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.160
The dirt?
Nope!

41:51.204 --> 41:52.901
This might take a while.

41:54.076 --> 41:55.991
Rust? Is it the rust?

41:56.035 --> 41:57.689
Yeah.
Are you serious?

41:57.732 --> 42:00.518
Nope, it's the rust.

42:00.561 --> 42:03.782
I wish we had grabbed a few
things from our bags first.

42:03.825 --> 42:06.828
Still... could
use a toothbrush.

42:08.395 --> 42:10.528
What?

42:10.571 --> 42:11.964
Mom, what's wrong?

42:12.007 --> 42:13.748
Did you forget
Charlie's insulin kit?

42:16.534 --> 42:17.491
No...

42:18.971 --> 42:20.842
but I left the money in the car.

42:20.886 --> 42:22.931
What?!

42:22.975 --> 42:24.324
Why would you leave
the money in the car?

42:24.367 --> 42:26.718
Because I didn't want
to put it all in my purse.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.114
How much do we have left?

42:37.250 --> 42:39.557
Less than $300.
Cool.

42:41.210 --> 42:43.125
No, Charlie, not cool.

42:43.169 --> 42:45.475
We just left 6,000 bucks
with the cops.

42:50.306 --> 42:52.570
Come on, let's go.
Come on!

42:54.310 --> 42:56.008
So, here's what we got so far.

42:56.051 --> 42:57.444
Amy calls this kid, Jake.

42:57.487 --> 42:59.620
We trace the number
to this fleabag motel.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.361
When the cops got there,
they're gone,

43:01.404 --> 43:03.145
but the good news is they
got the car and the money.

43:03.189 --> 43:04.756
What about the passports?

43:04.799 --> 43:06.496
No, she still has 'em,

43:06.540 --> 43:08.847
but they're on foot,
and they're low on options.

43:08.890 --> 43:10.762
So, why haven't
we picked them up?

43:10.805 --> 43:13.155
We have several cars
canvassing the area.

43:13.199 --> 43:16.376
Go ahead and patch us through.
Yep.

43:16.419 --> 43:19.031
Yeah, they've been looking for...
for days. MAN 2: Nothing yet, huh?

43:19.074 --> 43:20.510
Nothing yet,
except for the damn kids.

43:20.554 --> 43:23.078
What are we gonna do, Mom?

43:23.122 --> 43:25.646
I don't know, Amy,
I don't have all the answers.

43:25.690 --> 43:27.430
I'm just doing the best
that I can here.

43:27.474 --> 43:30.433
If this is your best,
I'd hate to see your worst.

43:33.828 --> 43:36.309
What else you want? You want
some chocolate chip cookies?

43:36.352 --> 43:38.790
Yeah.
Me too, I can't wait.

43:43.882 --> 43:46.449
You folks lost?

43:46.493 --> 43:48.626
Uh, no, we just had some
car trouble a while back,

43:48.669 --> 43:50.105
but we're good.
We're good now, thanks.

43:50.149 --> 43:51.672
Where you headed?

43:51.716 --> 43:53.805
California.

43:53.848 --> 43:54.849
Just the three of you?

43:56.416 --> 43:57.809
Uh, yeah.

43:57.852 --> 43:58.984
I could take y'all.

43:59.027 --> 44:00.638
Why don't you hop in?

44:02.204 --> 44:04.467
Mom, can I talk to you?

44:04.511 --> 44:06.078
Just one second.

44:06.121 --> 44:08.384
You're not seriously
considering this?

44:08.428 --> 44:10.778
We need a ride.
With this guy?!

44:10.822 --> 44:12.911
He could be a serial killer
for all we know.

44:12.954 --> 44:15.043
Amy, Darren is looking for us,

44:15.087 --> 44:16.697
and it's only a matter of time

44:16.741 --> 44:17.872
before he finds us.

44:17.916 --> 44:20.658
Good! Maybe we should let him.

44:20.701 --> 44:22.485
Look at us, Mom.

44:22.529 --> 44:24.487
We have nothing.

44:24.531 --> 44:27.839
I'm sure if you just apologize
to him he would take us back.

44:27.882 --> 44:30.058
Was it really that bad?

44:30.102 --> 44:32.495
It was worse, Amy, much worse.

44:32.539 --> 44:34.280
So tell me.

44:34.323 --> 44:36.456
Now is not the time.

44:36.499 --> 44:38.371
Now is never a good time!

44:38.414 --> 44:39.720
I am trying to protect you.

44:39.764 --> 44:42.375
Oh! Oh, you call this
protecting me?

44:45.726 --> 44:47.728
Who is this?

44:47.772 --> 44:50.078
That's Jake. Called him
from the motel last night.

44:50.122 --> 44:51.384
Are you serious?

44:51.427 --> 44:52.820
What is your problem?

44:52.864 --> 44:54.735
My problem is that
they can trace phone calls.

44:54.779 --> 44:57.346
It's a burner phone!
That doesn't mean they can't trace it.

44:57.390 --> 44:59.305
This phone was for
emergencies only,

44:59.348 --> 45:02.351
and you wonder why I don't
treat you like an adult.

45:02.395 --> 45:04.571
Yeah, this is Officer Cheney.

45:04.614 --> 45:06.834
We're pulling into the truck stop
just north of the motel in a moment.

45:06.878 --> 45:10.185
Copy that. Mrs. Lattimer
is considered a flight risk,

45:10.229 --> 45:12.274
and armed and dangerous.
Copy that, we'll let you know what we see.

45:19.325 --> 45:20.239
Mom, where's Charlie?

45:22.807 --> 45:24.634
Charlie.

45:24.678 --> 45:27.072
Charlie!

45:27.115 --> 45:28.900
Did you see which way my son went?
No.

45:28.943 --> 45:32.381
Charlie? Charlie!

45:32.425 --> 45:34.035
Where did you go?

46:05.719 --> 46:06.807
Charlie?

46:20.734 --> 46:23.955
Uh, yeah, we've got eyewitness
confirmation. They're here.

46:23.998 --> 46:26.522
Roger that. Let me know when you
have visible confirmation. Over.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.624
Charlie!

46:46.804 --> 46:49.371
This is Officer Dean. We have
contact with the phone company.

46:49.415 --> 46:51.547
They're getting a signal from her phone.
Paul, call her now.

46:59.773 --> 47:02.167
Who is it? Yeah, we just spoke
with a trucker who claimed...

47:02.210 --> 47:03.733
Whose phone is that? Is that hers?
Shh!

47:06.258 --> 47:08.521
Uh, we think we got 'em.
They're in the trailer now.

47:08.564 --> 47:10.001
Closing in now.
Go, go, go, go.

47:19.575 --> 47:21.055
I told you,
you got the wrong guy.

47:26.278 --> 47:29.150
She ditched the phone under the truck.
Damn it!

47:29.194 --> 47:30.238
God!

47:34.503 --> 47:36.244
♪ Run out of road

47:36.288 --> 47:38.551
<i>♪ Run out of love</i>

47:38.594 --> 47:42.642
<i>♪ Run across the country
in my pick-up truck ♪</i>

47:42.685 --> 47:45.514
<i>♪ That's the way I live, whoo</i>

47:45.558 --> 47:47.908
<i>♪ She left me</i>

47:49.736 --> 47:51.781
What? You guys don't
like country music?

47:51.825 --> 47:53.566
Does anyone?
Well, I do.

47:55.263 --> 47:57.222
This feels safe, Mom.

48:06.231 --> 48:08.973
Wes, thank you
for being so nice,

48:09.016 --> 48:12.628
but, um, you can just
drop us off at the next stop.

48:12.672 --> 48:14.195
Thought y'all were
headed to California.

48:14.239 --> 48:16.067
Well, we are, but um,

48:16.110 --> 48:17.459
I think we'll just rent a car.

48:18.983 --> 48:20.114
Out here?

48:21.507 --> 48:22.769
Good luck.

48:22.812 --> 48:26.207
The next stop
will be fine... really.

48:29.994 --> 48:32.431
Tell you what, I know this little
restaurant off the highway a stretch.

48:32.474 --> 48:34.955
Best food you'll find for miles.

48:34.999 --> 48:37.392
I say, we go on,
grab a bite, my treat,

48:37.436 --> 48:39.046
and if you still feel
like parting ways,

48:39.090 --> 48:40.700
then, uh...

48:40.743 --> 48:42.397
you should be able to find
a ride there, no problem.

48:45.139 --> 48:46.575
I don't know,
I don't think that's

48:46.619 --> 48:47.750
Come on.
A very good idea.

48:47.794 --> 48:48.664
I'm hungry.

48:55.889 --> 48:57.978
Good. It's settled then.

49:07.074 --> 49:08.989
Hey, they have key lime pie!

49:09.033 --> 49:11.992
Oh, hold up. You love key lime pie?
I love it!

49:12.036 --> 49:15.039
Well, did you know my mother makes the
best key lime pie in the country?

49:15.082 --> 49:16.301
It's a well-known fact.

49:16.344 --> 49:17.867
I wanna try it.

49:17.911 --> 49:20.261
Well, when you folks
get to where you're going,

49:20.305 --> 49:22.220
I'll have her send you a piece.
Wait a second.

49:22.263 --> 49:25.397
You can send pie in the mail?
Yeah.

49:25.440 --> 49:28.139
Hey, Charlie, you have to check
your levels before you eat dessert.

49:28.182 --> 49:30.228
Uh-oh.
There you go.

49:30.271 --> 49:31.185
Thank you.

49:32.926 --> 49:34.841
Whoa, buddy, complicated stuff.

49:34.884 --> 49:37.061
Not really. It just
measures the blood sugar.

49:37.104 --> 49:40.151
Mm-hmm.
Ah! Did that hurt?

49:40.194 --> 49:41.587
You get used to it.

49:41.630 --> 49:43.241
Yeah, well, I can't
stand needles.

49:43.284 --> 49:45.678
I don't think I could handle that.
145.

49:45.721 --> 49:47.288
Is that good?

49:47.332 --> 49:49.203
Yeah.
Yeah? What's bad?

49:49.247 --> 49:51.727
400.
What happens then?

49:51.771 --> 49:54.078
Too much sugar,
or hyperglycemia,

49:54.121 --> 49:55.731
and you can go
into shock or a coma.

49:55.775 --> 49:58.517
Too much insulin,
that's hypoglycemia,

49:58.560 --> 50:00.649
you go into shock or a coma.

50:00.693 --> 50:03.609
Either way sucks.
Yeah, sounds like it.

50:03.652 --> 50:06.438
Hey, you guys wanna go
check out the pies?

50:06.481 --> 50:08.570
You know how many carbs
are in a slice of pie?

50:08.614 --> 50:11.051
Amy, come on. Please just
go with your brother.

50:15.838 --> 50:18.189
Good kids.
Yeah, I like 'em.

50:18.232 --> 50:19.929
Where's Dad?

50:21.105 --> 50:22.802
Sorry. None of my business.

50:22.845 --> 50:26.980
No, it's just...
it's complicated.

50:27.024 --> 50:29.548
You know whatever it is,
I'm just... I'm happy to help.

50:32.290 --> 50:34.596
Why?
I don't know.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.208
You seem like good people. To be
honest, I could use the karma.

50:40.428 --> 50:42.474
So, what's your
impression of us truckers?

50:42.517 --> 50:45.259
I don't know. You're the only
one I've ever met, so...

50:45.303 --> 50:46.260
And?

50:47.914 --> 50:50.525
And I think the kids are tired.

50:50.569 --> 50:51.831
I should probably...

50:51.874 --> 50:54.268
This one is on me.

50:55.661 --> 50:57.054
Come on, you've
already done plenty.

50:57.097 --> 50:59.665
I'm not gonna let you
pay for our food.

50:59.708 --> 51:00.709
Rock, paper, scissors?

51:02.711 --> 51:04.800
What?
Come on, rock, paper, scissors.

51:07.238 --> 51:08.717
What are we, eight years old?

51:08.761 --> 51:10.415
Loser pays. Come on!

51:10.458 --> 51:12.765
Ready? Go!

51:14.680 --> 51:17.291
Oh! Well, looks like
this one's on me.

51:31.218 --> 51:32.393
We gotta get you to bed.

51:35.353 --> 51:38.921
Alright, here we are.
Two deluxe suites.

51:38.965 --> 51:41.533
How about guys in one
room, girls in the other?

51:41.576 --> 51:43.709
I don't think so.
Oh.

51:43.752 --> 51:46.015
Or adults in one room,
kids in the other room?

51:46.059 --> 51:48.757
How about kids in one room,

51:48.801 --> 51:50.542
your mom in her own room,
and me out in the truck?

51:50.585 --> 51:53.849
No, Wes, please take a room.
The kids and I are gonna share.

51:53.893 --> 51:55.634
I'm not sharing
a room with Charlie.

51:55.677 --> 51:57.853
And I don't want you in my room.
Guys, please.

51:57.897 --> 51:59.551
It's fine, really,
I'm used to sleeping out there.

51:59.594 --> 52:02.597
Besides, y'all had
a long day, and uh...

52:02.641 --> 52:03.859
deserve a nice, solid mattress.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.472
Are you sure?
Positive.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.388
Goodnight y'all.
Alright.

52:10.431 --> 52:11.519
Goodnight!
Thank you.

52:16.133 --> 52:18.657
None of your
business, Nose-Ina!

53:06.313 --> 53:09.838
Oh! You scared me.
I'm sorry.

53:09.882 --> 53:12.014
What are you doing sneaking around
here in the middle of the night?

53:12.058 --> 53:15.583
Um, well, I just... I saw
your truck light was on.

53:15.627 --> 53:17.933
Had a little trouble sleeping.

53:17.977 --> 53:19.761
Yeah, me too.

53:21.459 --> 53:23.461
Want something to drink?

53:23.504 --> 53:25.985
I got a wide variety of energy
drinks and caffeinated beverages.

53:26.028 --> 53:29.989
No, thanks. I-I just came out
to say I'm sorry. For what?

53:30.032 --> 53:33.819
Well, you've been very
kind to me and my family,

53:33.862 --> 53:37.257
and I was kind of a bitch
when we first met,

53:37.301 --> 53:40.173
and I just wanted
to say I am sorry,

53:40.217 --> 53:41.435
and thank you.

53:43.089 --> 53:46.266
Alright, uh, good night.

53:46.310 --> 53:48.660
Wait, that... that's it?

53:48.703 --> 53:50.879
Um, what do you mean?

53:53.621 --> 53:55.928
Rock, paper, scissors? Hmm?

53:55.971 --> 53:58.887
For what?
You win, you go back to your room.

53:58.931 --> 54:01.673
I win, you hang out.

54:01.716 --> 54:04.328
Thirty minutes, just talking. No
funny business. "No funny business."

54:04.371 --> 54:07.113
Promise. What do you say?

54:07.156 --> 54:08.549
Alright.

54:10.290 --> 54:11.291
Ready?
Here we go.

54:11.335 --> 54:12.553
Alright.
Okay.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.818
Oh! Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

54:18.864 --> 54:21.823
This is my second
time on a roof today.

54:21.867 --> 54:24.478
I... Heights
are not my thing.

54:24.522 --> 54:26.437
Oh, come on!

54:26.480 --> 54:28.874
It's beautiful out here.

54:28.917 --> 54:30.528
Pretty nice.
Yeah.

54:30.571 --> 54:32.573
Alright, alright.

54:32.617 --> 54:35.184
You see that big group
of stars right up above us?

54:35.228 --> 54:38.492
I think so.
That is Orion...

54:38.536 --> 54:42.279
or Pegasus or...

54:42.322 --> 54:43.845
actually, I have no idea
what I'm talking about.

54:45.412 --> 54:47.545
I didn't think so.

54:47.588 --> 54:50.374
Does this work on all the girls
you pick up at truck stops?

54:50.417 --> 54:52.245
No, you're the first.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.987
Girls at truck stops
are called "Lot Lizards."

54:55.030 --> 54:57.163
Pretty hard to meet
a nice girl at a truck stop.

55:00.253 --> 55:03.038
So, you think
I'm a nice girl, huh?

55:03.082 --> 55:06.433
Yeah, sure, for a bank robber.

55:06.477 --> 55:10.872
Okay, I'm assuming that you're
talking about the cash in my purse.

55:10.916 --> 55:13.135
Well, I'm not a bank robber.
That was all mine.

55:13.179 --> 55:14.528
Ours.
Okay.

55:14.572 --> 55:17.618
Uh, it's all gone by the way.

55:17.662 --> 55:20.534
Just in case you were
thinking about stealing it.

55:20.578 --> 55:23.798
Well, nice knowing ya.

55:23.842 --> 55:25.539
Okay!

55:27.715 --> 55:30.936
Alright, so you may
not be a criminal, but...

55:30.979 --> 55:32.459
you're definitely
running from something.

55:35.549 --> 55:36.768
Was he really that bad?

55:41.860 --> 55:43.383
Not at first.

55:45.429 --> 55:48.040
In the beginning,
it was kind of a fairy tale.

55:48.083 --> 55:50.172
He was a cop.

55:50.216 --> 55:52.566
He was very
competent and strong.

55:52.610 --> 55:55.308
Made me feel safe.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.571
And the way he looked at me.

55:57.615 --> 55:59.878
It was like I was
the only girl in the world.

56:01.575 --> 56:03.447
But...

56:03.490 --> 56:05.753
over the years,
the look changed,

56:05.797 --> 56:08.365
and he became controlling,

56:08.408 --> 56:12.281
and he stopped
trusting me, and...

56:15.807 --> 56:16.895
He become violent?

56:18.984 --> 56:19.898
Yeah.

56:21.508 --> 56:24.555
Yeah, my pop was the same way.

56:24.598 --> 56:27.209
My mom never had
the guts to leave him.

56:27.253 --> 56:30.561
I'm sorry. That...

56:30.604 --> 56:33.041
That must have been
really hard for a kid.

56:33.085 --> 56:34.608
Yeah, but, you know,
we survived.

56:36.523 --> 56:37.872
Just like you.

56:37.916 --> 56:39.352
You're a survivor.

56:42.486 --> 56:43.530
Is that how you see me?

56:46.968 --> 56:48.883
No, I actually see
a lot more than that.

56:58.806 --> 57:01.940
You know, I should probably
get back to the room.

57:03.158 --> 57:05.247
You sure?
Yeah.

57:05.291 --> 57:07.641
I'm just gonna...

57:07.685 --> 57:10.470
head back to the old,
lumpy mattress.

57:10.514 --> 57:12.777
I'm just gonna stay
out here, and uh...

57:12.820 --> 57:15.344
you know, work on
my constellations.

57:15.388 --> 57:16.824
Okay.

57:19.218 --> 57:21.089
Goodnight.
Night, Erin.

57:30.969 --> 57:32.579
Hey, Wes?

57:33.798 --> 57:35.669
I locked my key in my room.

57:45.244 --> 57:47.725
Mr. Lattimer, as soon as
you're ready, we're set to go.

57:47.768 --> 57:48.769
Thank you.

58:01.869 --> 58:03.741
Coming up in our next segment,

58:03.784 --> 58:06.178
the nation's Amber Alert system.

58:06.221 --> 58:08.093
How well is it working?

58:08.136 --> 58:10.138
Can you trust it?
Whoa.

58:10.182 --> 58:12.358
I had an interview with District
Attorney Darren Lattimer,

58:12.401 --> 58:14.316
who has issued an Amber
Alert on his own wife.

58:15.448 --> 58:17.537
Mom!

58:17.581 --> 58:19.496
Mom, Darren's gonna be on TV.

58:34.902 --> 58:35.990
What... what...
What's wrong?

58:36.034 --> 58:37.601
Where's my mom?

58:37.644 --> 58:39.646
What's wrong?
Oh my God.

58:39.690 --> 58:41.430
I can't believe you!

58:41.474 --> 58:44.085
Relax! It's not
what it looks like.

58:44.129 --> 58:47.436
I locked myself out. I slept back
here, and Wes slept up front.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.438
Do you think I'm stupid?

58:49.482 --> 58:51.223
You think you can just
do whatever you want,

58:51.266 --> 58:53.312
and you're so selfish, Mom!

58:53.355 --> 58:58.143
Oh, and FYI, Darren's on TV.

58:58.186 --> 58:59.927
We're talking with
Darren Lattimer,

58:59.971 --> 59:02.713
popular District Attorney of St.
Charles county, Virgina,

59:02.756 --> 59:04.671
and possible Congressional candidate.
Mom, look!

59:04.715 --> 59:06.630
Daddy's on TV.
Good morning, Mr. Lattimer.

59:06.673 --> 59:09.110
It's good to be here.
I'm just gonna jump right in.

59:09.154 --> 59:12.331
Was it a difficult decision to issue an
Amber Alert on your own wife and kids?

59:12.374 --> 59:14.638
Yes, that's an
understatement. Yes.

59:14.681 --> 59:18.076
Um, but let's be clear. I am only
doing this to protect my children.

59:18.119 --> 59:20.382
As you know, Amber Alerts
are only sanctioned

59:20.426 --> 59:22.602
if there's an imminent
threat on a child's safety.

59:22.646 --> 59:24.735
I can't believe it.

59:24.778 --> 59:27.041
And you believe your own wife is a threat?
I'm afraid so.

59:27.085 --> 59:28.652
We have a gun in our house

59:28.695 --> 59:30.305
in a safe with a combination

59:30.349 --> 59:33.004
only known by
my wife and myself.

59:33.047 --> 59:34.745
That gun is missing.

59:34.788 --> 59:37.574
What... He's lying! I didn't...
I didn't take his gun.

59:37.617 --> 59:38.966
Is that all?

59:42.666 --> 59:45.669
I'm sorry, uh, no, it's not.

59:45.712 --> 59:48.802
This is... this is
difficult to talk about.

59:48.846 --> 59:50.543
I love my wife,

59:50.587 --> 59:53.241
but she suffers
from mental illness.

59:53.285 --> 59:56.375
She's been on and off
medication for years now.

59:56.418 --> 59:59.944
Battling this disease, I mean,
there's even been suicide attempts,

59:59.987 --> 01:00:01.641
and even threats
to our own children.

01:00:03.338 --> 01:00:06.777
I have done everything...

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:09.040
that I could to help her,

01:00:09.083 --> 01:00:10.955
but recently, she's
gone off her meds again,

01:00:10.998 --> 01:00:12.870
and quite frankly,
I am afraid of what...

01:00:12.913 --> 01:00:14.741
What she's capable of.

01:00:14.785 --> 01:00:17.178
I'm gonna step outside.

01:00:17.222 --> 01:00:19.964
Well, it seems to me...

01:00:20.007 --> 01:00:22.531
the bigger discussion here
is mental health in America

01:00:22.575 --> 01:00:24.490
and the stigma put on that.

01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:31.497
My wife needs help.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.239
Okay, but she's
afraid of what...

01:00:34.282 --> 01:00:36.633
Of the damage that
she could... she could do.

01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:40.027
To your career?
Yes.

01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:41.812
I'm a public figure, okay?

01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:44.379
Our lives, our whole lives
are under a microscope.

01:00:47.252 --> 01:00:49.167
Hey! Hey, listen.

01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:53.301
I'm gonna explain
all of this to you later.

01:00:53.345 --> 01:00:54.912
Okay?
Okay.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:57.436
Okay, pack your stuff.
We gotta go.

01:00:57.479 --> 01:00:59.133
Oh, what about Amy?

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:02.876
Keep an eye on Charlie.
I gotta find Amy.

01:01:04.051 --> 01:01:05.313
Yeah, sure.

01:01:15.628 --> 01:01:17.935
Amy, you get back
here right now!

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:20.198
Amy, stop!

01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:21.329
What are you doing?

01:01:21.373 --> 01:01:22.896
Going home.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.856
Do you know what happens
to teenage girls who hitchhike?

01:01:25.899 --> 01:01:28.249
They end up sleeping
in a truck with a stranger?

01:01:28.293 --> 01:01:30.077
Nothing happened with Wes, Amy.

01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:31.992
I miss Jake,
and I miss my friends,

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:33.994
and I don't want
to live in California.

01:01:36.649 --> 01:01:38.695
Amy, you may not realize this,

01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:42.046
but everything I ever do
is because of you.

01:01:42.089 --> 01:01:43.482
Okay?

01:01:43.525 --> 01:01:44.788
I know you didn't know your dad,

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:47.399
and I'm really sorry about that.

01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:52.360
When I met Darren,

01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:53.579
I thought he was a good man.

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:55.973
He was a solid...

01:01:56.016 --> 01:01:57.670
A solid man who could...

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.759
give us a family we never
had and take care of us.

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:01.630
Be a father figure to you!

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:04.155
And I knew we had
problems early on,

01:02:04.198 --> 01:02:06.287
but I overlooked them,
and I hid them from you.

01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:13.642
That time that I broke my arm?

01:02:13.686 --> 01:02:15.427
That was him.

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:17.734
That was not a bicycle accident.

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:29.702
I didn't have
the strength to leave him.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.356
He really broke your arm?

01:02:38.232 --> 01:02:40.757
Why didn't you tell me?

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.324
I know, I'm sorry. I should have.
I should have told you, I...

01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:49.069
Maybe if I did, we wouldn't
be standing here right now.

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:54.466
I love you.

01:02:54.509 --> 01:02:56.511
I love you too, Mom.

01:03:02.953 --> 01:03:04.911
So, let's get your stuff together.
We gotta go.

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:08.741
Charlie?
In here, hurry!

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.525
Charlie?

01:03:10.569 --> 01:03:12.571
Oh my God, what happened?

01:03:12.614 --> 01:03:14.965
He was... he was feeling weird.
I tried to take a reading and...

01:03:15.008 --> 01:03:17.054
I think I broke the needle.
Okay, move.

01:03:17.097 --> 01:03:19.012
Charlie? Baby?
What's his level?

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:20.666
Level? I don't know,
I don't know.

01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:22.668
I tried checking it on the...
Did you give him insulin?

01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:25.192
No, not yet! There's like six
different kinds of medicine.

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:09.497
Come on, come on, come on, come
on, please, please, please.

01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:13.458
Wes, he's okay now.

01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:15.025
I am very sorry that
you had to go through that.

01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:20.334
I could've killed him!

01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:24.686
Jesus.

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:27.298
Is there anything else
I need to know?

01:04:27.341 --> 01:04:28.560
Huh?

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:33.608
After Charlie was born...

01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:35.567
I had post-partum
depression.

01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:39.658
And it lasted longer than usual.

01:04:39.701 --> 01:04:41.529
I was on anti-depressants.

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:48.536
So that's what he was talking
about on the news. Yes.

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:51.148
But I'm fine now,

01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:53.628
he was just twisting it.

01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:56.109
He was just twisting it
to make himself seem...

01:04:57.937 --> 01:05:00.548
You know what, if I would
have stayed there...

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.073
he would have killed me.

01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:07.729
So, if you wanna
part ways right now, please.

01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:09.601
Go ahead.

01:05:09.644 --> 01:05:11.646
You have done more than enough.

01:05:23.702 --> 01:05:25.138
Now, we're sure
she's heading west.

01:05:25.182 --> 01:05:28.098
We're just not sure how
or who she's traveling with.

01:05:28.141 --> 01:05:30.317
What? You think she's
with someone else?

01:05:30.361 --> 01:05:33.494
Well, I think we have to be
open to the possibility.

01:05:33.538 --> 01:05:36.541
How sure are you that she was...
What? Loyal?

01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:38.282
Are you saying she was
having an affair?

01:05:38.325 --> 01:05:40.980
Well, she's managed
to elude us thus far.

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:43.026
It's possible
someone's helping her.

01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:45.724
Is this what you do?
You sit around and speculate

01:05:45.767 --> 01:05:48.857
how my wife is screwing
another guy behind my back?

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:51.251
I'm on your side.
Are you?

01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:54.602
Throw your ego out the door,
and focus on finding your wife.

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:56.604
'Cause if we don't...
Then you're not on my side.

01:05:56.648 --> 01:05:59.216
I'm not gonna take
the fall for your mistake.

01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:01.261
My mistake?
It's your wife.

01:06:01.305 --> 01:06:02.654
You let this happen.

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:04.612
You listen to me,
and you listen good.

01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:07.050
You let Martinez walk too.

01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:08.703
Your hands are just
as dirty as mine.

01:06:08.747 --> 01:06:11.315
Whose Mexican stamps
are in his passport?

01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:13.534
The one that's out there
with his wife right now!

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:14.927
That was never part of the deal.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:17.625
Why don't you tell me
what the deal is? Okay?

01:06:17.669 --> 01:06:19.540
What's the deal, Lou?

01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:22.326
If we don't find her...

01:06:22.369 --> 01:06:24.545
I'm washing my hands,

01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:26.199
and you're gonna be all alone.

Hey, Mr. Lattimer.

01:07:51.545 --> 01:07:53.460
What's going on?
Hey, Jake.

01:07:53.504 --> 01:07:54.809
I just came by to see
how you were holding up.

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:58.987
I'm okay.
Hmm, and how's Amy?

01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:03.862
I don't...
I don't really know.

01:08:03.905 --> 01:08:07.344
You talked to her the other
night at the motel, didn't you?

01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:11.565
Motel? I'm not sure what
you're talking about, sir.

01:08:11.609 --> 01:08:13.654
Ah.

01:08:13.698 --> 01:08:17.093
Why don't you... why don't you...
why don't you jump in the car?

01:08:17.136 --> 01:08:18.442
I think you and I need
to have a little talk.

01:08:19.834 --> 01:08:21.836
I, uh, I'm good, sir.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.663
I actually have
somewhere I gotta be.

01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:27.973
Get in the car, son.

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:43.770
Talk.

01:08:43.814 --> 01:08:46.165
Okay, you... you were right.

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:47.688
We... we did talk
the other night,

01:08:47.732 --> 01:08:49.473
but she didn't tell me anything.

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:51.170
I swear.
Why'd you lie?

01:08:51.214 --> 01:08:53.129
Because I didn't
want to get involved.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:56.915
Well, then, you talked to her
the next night too, didn't you?

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:59.874
That doesn't sound like someone
who doesn't want to get involved.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:02.050
Where they going?
I...

01:09:02.094 --> 01:09:03.573
I don't know, sir, I...

01:09:03.617 --> 01:09:06.490
I... I swear she
didn't tell me much.

01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:11.363
Jake, I'm the DA.

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:15.368
My best friends are cops.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.285
For your own
self-preservation,

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:21.069
I think...

01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:25.291
I need for you to think
long and hard...

01:09:25.335 --> 01:09:26.684
about what side you're on.

01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:31.863
You know in law enforcement...

01:09:31.906 --> 01:09:34.866
we're trained to not shoot
unless we're in imminent danger.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.738
But sometimes people get shot.

01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:43.917
And when they do, a jury tends
to believe our version.

01:09:45.572 --> 01:09:46.660
Look at me.

01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:49.314
Do you catch my drift?

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:54.320
Stacy's.

01:09:54.364 --> 01:09:56.757
But that's all she said! She just told
me that they were going to Stacy's.

01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:01.762
You're not lying to me.
No.

01:10:01.806 --> 01:10:03.155
You sure?
I swear.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.592
Alright. Okay,
you did good tonight.

01:10:07.115 --> 01:10:10.118
No!
No! It's my side!

01:10:10.162 --> 01:10:11.424

01:11:51.524 --> 01:11:53.221
Erin?
Hi, Stacy.

01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:57.138
I am so sorry
I didn't call first.

01:11:57.182 --> 01:11:59.358
I just... I didn't want anyone
to know where we were.

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:01.142
No, of course, of course.

01:12:01.186 --> 01:12:04.363
Is your offer still good?
Oh my God, of course!

01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:06.713
I saw Darren on the news. I've
been worried sick about you guys.

01:12:06.757 --> 01:12:08.367
Are you guys okay?

01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:11.022
We are now.
Hey, Erin.

01:12:11.065 --> 01:12:13.416
It's been a while.
Hey, it's been too long.

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:15.200
It's so good to see you, Jason.

01:12:15.243 --> 01:12:17.245

01:12:17.289 --> 01:12:19.247

No, I really need a shower.

01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:22.120

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:24.340
Thank you.

01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:27.386
I don't know how you did it,
but thank you.

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:29.170
I just kept my eyes on the road.

01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:32.696
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:12:35.263 --> 01:12:37.875
So, uh... what now?

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:41.313
I don't know. Guess I didn't
really think it out too much.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.184
I guess we start
some kinda life here.

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:48.407
Oh, you meant...
Just a general question is all.

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:50.496

01:12:52.455 --> 01:12:54.848

01:12:56.546 --> 01:12:58.591

01:12:58.635 --> 01:12:59.897
I could swing by.

01:13:01.289 --> 01:13:02.769
Hey, Erin!

01:13:02.813 --> 01:13:04.380

01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:08.558
Hey, rock, paper, scissors.

01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:09.907
I win, I swing by.

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:11.561
You win...

01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:13.127
I swing by.

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:18.176
Let's just call it you swing by.

01:13:18.219 --> 01:13:21.222
So, I guess, uh...

01:13:21.266 --> 01:13:22.572
Okay.
Yeah?

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.494
Um, alright.
Yeah.

01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:32.756
I'll try and make it.

01:13:32.799 --> 01:13:34.453

01:13:38.849 --> 01:13:40.807

I'm coming back for that.

01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:42.635
I get the hat. Okay.

01:13:42.679 --> 01:13:44.289

01:13:53.690 --> 01:13:55.256

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.999
I'm gonna turn in.
Okay.

01:13:59.043 --> 01:14:02.916
Yeah. Erin, you and the kids can
stay here as long as you'd like.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.744
Thank you, Jason.

01:14:04.788 --> 01:14:06.790
Gosh, I really appreciate that.
It's our pleasure.

01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:09.401
Now, no skinny-dipping,
you two.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.358
No promises.

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:15.538
Seriously, could he
be any more perfect?

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:17.627
Oh, I know. I got lucky.

01:14:19.237 --> 01:14:21.500
Speaking of, uh, getting lucky,

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:24.677
what's going on with you
and hunky truck driver man?

01:14:24.721 --> 01:14:26.940
Nothing! Nothing!
Uh-huh. Oh, stop.

01:14:26.984 --> 01:14:29.160
We just met.

01:14:29.203 --> 01:14:31.771
Stacy, this boat is incredible.

01:14:31.815 --> 01:14:33.207
Thank you.

01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:35.862
How are you doing?

01:14:39.257 --> 01:14:40.954
I'm better.
Yeah?

01:14:40.998 --> 01:14:42.782
Yeah, a lot better.

01:14:44.567 --> 01:14:47.874
Jason knows a great lawyer.

01:14:47.918 --> 01:14:50.747
I can put you in touch with
him whenever you're ready.

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:52.836
The most important
thing is that...

01:14:52.879 --> 01:14:54.968
you got away.

01:14:55.012 --> 01:14:56.448
You're safe here.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:57.493
Yeah.

01:14:59.756 --> 01:15:01.932
I feel much safer.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.558
I can't believe it's been a whole
week since I've used the internet.

01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:21.604
Don't post anything. We're
not out of the woods yet.

01:15:21.647 --> 01:15:23.257
Duh, Mom.

01:15:32.832 --> 01:15:34.573
Mom?

01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:36.227
Yeah, baby?

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:37.707
Are we gonna be okay?

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:41.580
Of course.

01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:43.539
Is Daddy gonna find us?

01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:50.981
Honey, you know your father
loves you very much.

01:15:51.024 --> 01:15:52.635
But if he really loved me,

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:55.072
he'd be nice to you.

01:15:55.115 --> 01:15:57.291
Sweetie...

01:15:57.335 --> 01:15:59.119
mine and your
daddy's problems...

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:02.645
have nothing to do
with you, okay?

01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:05.778
I know that's confusing,
but it's complicated.

01:16:05.822 --> 01:16:08.738
It's not complicated
to be nice, Mommy.

01:16:08.781 --> 01:16:10.609
It's normal.

01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:12.611
You're right.

01:16:15.179 --> 01:16:16.876
You're right.

01:16:40.073 --> 01:16:41.771
2015.

01:16:47.907 --> 01:16:49.517
Oh my God.

01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:56.916
Again, the rabbit
goes through the hole,

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.962
around the bend.

01:16:59.005 --> 01:17:00.920
Around the tree.
Uh-huh.

01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:02.487
Through the hole.
Uh-huh.

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:04.576
And pull.
Pull.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.274
Okay, now your turn.
Look at him.

01:17:07.318 --> 01:17:09.625
He's having so much fun.

01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:11.452
Which one?
And pull.

01:17:11.496 --> 01:17:13.672
Yes!

01:17:13.716 --> 01:17:14.717
We really needed this.

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:18.677
These past couple days...

01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:20.810
have been incredible.

01:17:20.853 --> 01:17:22.681
I think the kids are really
starting to like it here.

01:17:23.813 --> 01:17:25.292
Well, good.

01:17:25.336 --> 01:17:27.381
I think Jason wants a son.

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:29.209
So, give him one!
Oh, stop.

01:17:29.253 --> 01:17:30.907
I don't know what
you guys are waiting for.

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:33.474
Diapers? It all seems
so overwhelming.

01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:35.563
Anyway, taste this. Is
this a little too strong?

01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:44.007
No, doesn't taste
like any alcohol.

01:17:47.271 --> 01:17:49.534
Oh my God!

01:17:49.577 --> 01:17:52.058
Really?
Don't let Jason hear you.

01:17:52.102 --> 01:17:54.670
Don't tell Jason, don't tell Jason.
It's only been two months.

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:56.323
Don't say anything. His mom
doesn't even know yet.

01:17:56.367 --> 01:17:58.282
What's going on?
Nothing!

01:17:58.325 --> 01:18:00.937
We're just really happy
to see each other.

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.548
Hey, we should probably start getting ready
if we wanna see the fireworks tonight.

01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:06.159
Okay, babe.

01:18:06.203 --> 01:18:08.771
I can't believe it!

01:18:08.814 --> 01:18:10.773
<i>♪ Row my boat
to the shore, girl ♪</i>

01:18:10.816 --> 01:18:12.862
<i>♪ Row my boat to the shore</i>

01:18:12.905 --> 01:18:16.648
<i>♪ Row my boat to the shore,
pretty dancing girl ♪</i>

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.302
<i>♪ Row my boat to the shore</i>

01:18:18.345 --> 01:18:19.782
<i>♪ And you'll feel
the pain no more ♪</i>

01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:22.567
Stacy...

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:23.786
if I tell you something
about Darren,

01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:25.091
can you keep it a secret?

01:18:25.135 --> 01:18:27.833
At least, just for now.
Yeah, sure.

01:18:29.226 --> 01:18:30.880
I found something
in his passport,

01:18:30.923 --> 01:18:33.752
and I don't know
exactly what it means,

01:18:33.796 --> 01:18:36.494
but it does prove
that he was lying.

01:18:36.537 --> 01:18:38.496
You mean, like an affair?

01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:40.759
No, actually, it's worse.

01:18:40.803 --> 01:18:42.630
Hi.
Hey.

01:18:42.674 --> 01:18:44.632
Mom, I'm cold.

01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:47.984
Aw! Your sister went to get us
some jackets from the boat.

01:18:48.027 --> 01:18:49.768
Actually, she's been
gone a long time.

01:18:49.812 --> 01:18:51.291
Do you want me
to go check on her?

01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:53.598
'Cause there's a lot of cute
distractions around here.

01:18:53.641 --> 01:18:56.166
I'll go check on her.
Come here.

01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:57.645
You stay here.

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:01.954
Amy.

01:19:03.651 --> 01:19:04.957
Amy?

01:19:07.917 --> 01:19:10.571
Amy! Are you down here?

01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:15.751
Amy!

01:19:22.932 --> 01:19:25.369
Hi, sweetheart.

01:19:25.412 --> 01:19:27.893
Did you miss me?
Where's my daughter?

01:19:29.416 --> 01:19:31.462
Come on.

01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:32.811
How does that feel, Erin?

01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:34.639
Hmm?

01:19:34.682 --> 01:19:36.815
To lose a child?
To not know where she is?

01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:41.951
To not know if
she's alive or dead.

01:19:41.994 --> 01:19:43.822
Darren, please don't do this.

01:19:43.866 --> 01:19:46.825
Where is it?

01:19:46.869 --> 01:19:49.436
I don't know what you're talking about.
My passport.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.439
Where is it?

01:19:52.483 --> 01:19:54.267
I don't know. I think
it's with the other ones.

01:19:56.922 --> 01:19:58.315
Well, get it. Now.

01:19:59.751 --> 01:20:01.100
Get it!

01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:24.602
So, why don't you
join me above deck?

01:20:24.645 --> 01:20:26.647
And we can watch
fireworks like we used to.

01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:31.478
Who can argue
with a view like this?

01:20:34.438 --> 01:20:35.874
Darren...

01:20:35.918 --> 01:20:37.354
please.

01:20:38.485 --> 01:20:39.835
Where is she?

01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:50.193
There she is!
Amy!

01:20:50.236 --> 01:20:51.759
I'm here!

01:20:54.327 --> 01:20:56.808
Mom!

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:59.071
Get away from her.
You get away from her!

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.248
No problem.
I'll touch you then.

01:21:02.292 --> 01:21:04.860
Now, now, what? What?

01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:08.907
What? Come on, what?
Mom.

01:21:10.082 --> 01:21:11.431
You like that, hmm?

01:21:19.352 --> 01:21:20.919
Just let us go.

01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:23.008
I won't say anything to anybody.

01:21:23.052 --> 01:21:25.184
Just... just
let us go, Darren.

01:21:25.228 --> 01:21:27.360
Nah, I can't do that.
So what?

01:21:27.404 --> 01:21:29.754
Did you come all the way out here to
kill me? Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

01:21:29.797 --> 01:21:31.060
You're gonna do it yourself

01:21:31.103 --> 01:21:32.844
with the gun that you stole.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.324
I can see it now.

01:21:34.367 --> 01:21:38.197
"Suicidal mother abducts kids
and kills herself."

01:21:38.241 --> 01:21:40.199
You're crazy.
Yeah.

01:21:40.243 --> 01:21:41.548
I didn't plan on Amy being here.

01:21:41.592 --> 01:21:43.289
I guess you're gonna
have to kill her too.

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:45.944
If only you'd
left the kids out of it.

01:21:47.293 --> 01:21:49.687
I'd ignored your
little outburst,

01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:51.863
and I'd wait for you
to come back home

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.865
with your tail between
your legs like you always do.

01:21:55.084 --> 01:21:58.087
I'm never coming home, Darren.

01:22:03.527 --> 01:22:05.790
Mom!
Wait! I scanned the passports.

01:22:07.966 --> 01:22:09.228
I scanned the passports.

01:22:09.272 --> 01:22:11.187
Your passport.
Your little secret.

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:13.145
It's all in a file online.

01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:16.192
If anything happens
to me, or her,

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:19.238
Jason and Stacy are gonna
make those pages public,

01:22:19.282 --> 01:22:21.762
and I'm sure Carlos Martinez

01:22:21.806 --> 01:22:25.157
doesn't want the world to
know about his business

01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:27.290
with a certain
District Attorney.

01:22:31.163 --> 01:22:32.860
Don't let him get it!

01:22:34.079 --> 01:22:36.386
Hey! Wes!

01:22:36.429 --> 01:22:38.214
Hey!

01:22:38.257 --> 01:22:40.781
Stacy, how you doing?
Good, good. What's going on?

01:22:40.825 --> 01:22:44.611
Erin around?
She went to go get Amy a little while ago.

01:22:44.655 --> 01:22:48.267
How long they been gone?
30 minutes.

01:22:50.487 --> 01:22:51.836
You like that?

01:22:51.879 --> 01:22:54.404
Do you like that, huh?

01:22:54.447 --> 01:22:56.710
Where you goin'? Where you goin'?
You wanna fight me?

01:22:56.754 --> 01:22:58.799
You gonna fight me?
Oh, yeah.

01:22:58.843 --> 01:23:01.019
God! Come on, fight back.

01:23:01.063 --> 01:23:02.803
Come on, fight.

01:23:02.847 --> 01:23:05.023
Come on.

01:23:05.067 --> 01:23:06.590
Good, you wanna go?

01:23:08.679 --> 01:23:11.812
Come here, come here. God! Ow!

01:23:11.856 --> 01:23:14.032
Freaking bitch!

01:23:14.076 --> 01:23:15.860
Ah, you bitch!
Amy!

01:23:24.825 --> 01:23:26.436
You're gonna die, you hear me?

01:23:29.961 --> 01:23:31.528
Come on, Erin!

01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:47.283
Stay away from my family.

01:23:51.983 --> 01:23:54.072
Are you okay?
What did he do to you?

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:57.119
Mom, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:23:57.162 --> 01:23:59.251
So you're okay?
I'm okay, Mom.

01:23:59.295 --> 01:24:01.123
I'm sorry.

01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:16.747
Erin!

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:18.966
Erin?
I'm here! I'm here.

01:24:20.751 --> 01:24:22.840
What the hell happened?

01:24:22.883 --> 01:24:24.320
We're okay.

01:24:24.363 --> 01:24:25.930
We're alright.

01:24:25.973 --> 01:24:27.279
Oh!

01:25:16.372 --> 01:25:18.461
Hurry up! Mom!
Alright, slow down, Charlie!

01:25:18.504 --> 01:25:20.245
They're back.
Already?

01:25:20.289 --> 01:25:21.725
You're never gonna
guess what happened!

01:25:21.768 --> 01:25:24.902
Charlie probably scared
all the fish away.

01:25:24.945 --> 01:25:26.643
Hey, Charlie,
did you get anything?

01:25:26.686 --> 01:25:27.818
Any luck out there, guys?

01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:29.167
Yeah, we did alright.

01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:31.430
Alright? We caught
three fish, Mom!

01:25:31.474 --> 01:25:33.519
Three fish? You should
have seen us fight this big one.

01:25:33.563 --> 01:25:35.782
It was so huge it almost
tipped the boat over!

01:25:35.826 --> 01:25:38.176
It almost tipped the boat over?

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:39.960
Come over here.
And we saw a dolphin.

01:25:40.004 --> 01:25:41.136
A dolphin?

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:42.572
Full adults.

01:25:42.615 --> 01:25:45.227
The second fish which
jumped in the boat,

01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:47.403
but the other one almost ate it.

01:25:47.446 --> 01:25:48.926
And the third fish...

01:25:48.969 --> 01:25:51.276
Hey! Hey, give me
my hat back!

01:25:54.323 --> 01:25:55.889
