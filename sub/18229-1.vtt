WEBVTT

01:21.396 --> 01:22.718
Elliott.

01:22.798 --> 01:25.336
At least I've got manners, Steven.

01:40.248 --> 01:42.905
Greta. Greta, right?

01:42.985 --> 01:44.623
- Yeah.
- That's a good name.

01:44.703 --> 01:47.525
What's it short for? Gretel?

01:48.105 --> 01:49.842
Margareta?

01:52.660 --> 01:56.666
Or just Greta?
You know, as in short for Greta?

01:58.265 --> 02:00.302
Right, cool.

02:00.668 --> 02:02.505
I'm Elliott.

02:11.846 --> 02:13.869
- Are you 14?
- Yeah.

02:13.949 --> 02:17.506
Snap, me too! 14 is good, huh?

02:17.586 --> 02:21.677
But I'm seriously looking forward to 15.
I think 15's gonna turn a corner.

02:21.757 --> 02:25.414
It's gonna be so awesome.
It's gonna herald the dawn of a new era,

02:25.494 --> 02:27.566
or something like that.

02:29.898 --> 02:34.170
- Are you from around here?
- No, we just moved.

02:37.171 --> 02:40.509
Cool, right, yeah, awesome.

02:40.608 --> 02:42.445
'Cause I am.

02:43.844 --> 02:45.300
You know, from around here.

02:45.380 --> 02:48.104
I know pretty much everything
there is to know about around here.

02:48.184 --> 02:51.707
I know the population, elevation,
average rainfall, climate, local industries.

02:51.787 --> 02:54.324
You know, that sort of thing.

02:55.690 --> 02:58.212
Elliott, Elliott.

02:58.292 --> 03:00.864
- Elliott!
- Whatever, Steven!

03:05.833 --> 03:07.923
So, do you have any brothers?

03:09.503 --> 03:12.094
What about sisters? Do you have any sisters?

03:12.174 --> 03:14.396
- Yeah.
- Oh, awesome.

03:14.476 --> 03:16.546
Sisters are the best.

03:18.346 --> 03:21.270
What about friends? Do you have any friends?

03:21.350 --> 03:22.918
Really?

03:23.484 --> 03:25.489
'Cause we can be friends.

03:26.888 --> 03:30.647
If you want.
I'm pretty non-judgmental, you know.

03:31.727 --> 03:35.317
I'm usually happy to just go
with the flow, actually.

03:35.397 --> 03:38.203
I find that's the best way
to be friendly with people.

03:41.702 --> 03:43.425
I've got six Guinea pigs.

03:43.505 --> 03:47.210
I count them as good friends, but their
lifespan tends to hamper things a little.

03:51.712 --> 03:53.783
Oh, no, please!

03:58.286 --> 04:01.643
So what do you reckon?
Should we just hang out or something?

04:01.723 --> 04:05.729
We don't have to.
I just I haven't got much to do, so.

04:06.995 --> 04:09.051
- Sure.
- Really?

04:09.131 --> 04:11.920
- I guess.
- Oh, awesome.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.671
Good choice. I like your thinking.

04:16.570 --> 04:20.673
We should get a donut. We should
totally celebrate this with a donut.

04:21.777 --> 04:23.832
- Okay.
- Wait here.

04:23.912 --> 04:25.915
Just wait here.

04:30.251 --> 04:31.571
Hey.

04:43.598 --> 04:45.688
You're hanging out with us.

04:46.168 --> 04:48.472
We've taken quite a shine to you.

04:51.072 --> 04:52.627
I...

04:54.242 --> 04:57.113
We like you, new girl.

04:58.612 --> 05:01.237
Don't spoil it now by speaking.

05:01.717 --> 05:03.986
He's not invited.

05:44.392 --> 05:46.595
Greta!

05:57.972 --> 06:00.741
Greta, time!

06:07.698 --> 06:10.303
- Greta!
- Coming!

06:12.788 --> 06:14.857
Pencil, quick!

06:16.857 --> 06:18.962
There's eyeliner in my bag.

06:39.815 --> 06:41.617
She's home.

06:44.085 --> 06:46.908
What do you call this, Genevieve?
What the hell do you call this?

06:46.988 --> 06:48.825
6:24.

06:50.057 --> 06:52.496
Don't speak to your mother like that!

06:57.865 --> 06:59.435
Hey.

07:09.877 --> 07:11.550
Give her these, will ya?

07:13.664 --> 07:15.468
See ya, babes.

07:28.763 --> 07:32.230
I don't know why you think this behavior
is acceptable. I raised you better than this.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.536
- What, than to be a slut?
- Oi, watch it!

07:34.616 --> 07:37.206
You think you can
just throw yourself on anyone?

07:42.210 --> 07:43.913
Conrad!

08:10.871 --> 08:12.460
Hey.

08:12.840 --> 08:17.065
Have you... have you heard of
that new movie, what's it called?

08:19.167 --> 08:20.482
Constipation.

08:23.117 --> 08:25.772
- No.
- It's 'cause it hasn't come out yet.

08:28.389 --> 08:30.545
- I saw Diarrhea, though.
- Oh, enough!

08:30.625 --> 08:33.648
- It got leaked early.
- We're still eating!

08:33.727 --> 08:35.316
Seven, definitely a seven.

08:35.395 --> 08:37.833
Well, hey, I haven't got a seven in a while.

08:39.267 --> 08:42.948
- I'll get it.
- If it's for me, don't answer it.

08:57.685 --> 09:00.422
Oi, come on, lights out.

09:14.602 --> 09:16.172
Comfy?

09:17.805 --> 09:19.606
Goodnight, sweetheart.

09:54.142 --> 09:55.911
Come on.

10:22.670 --> 10:24.825
So anyway.

10:24.905 --> 10:29.164
I suggested she should use more tongue
next time, if she wants that to work.

10:29.544 --> 10:31.648
Especially on Derek.

10:33.113 --> 10:35.435
- Really?
- Did you?

10:35.515 --> 10:38.707
No, 'cause dad came home,
and we had to go downstairs

10:38.787 --> 10:41.043
and pretend nothing was happening.

10:41.623 --> 10:43.878
Didn't we, Amber?

10:43.958 --> 10:47.313
- That's full on, hey?
- Not really.

10:48.929 --> 10:50.967
What do you normally do?

10:52.416 --> 10:55.941
- What?
- More tongue, or less?

10:56.021 --> 10:57.590
Me?

10:59.473 --> 11:02.196
It depends, I guess.

11:02.276 --> 11:03.832
Really?

11:03.912 --> 11:05.281
On what?

11:06.614 --> 11:09.951
Whether I feel like it...

11:10.951 --> 11:12.721
or not.

11:15.939 --> 11:17.929
Hey, I can't remember.

11:18.009 --> 11:20.966
Are we going skating
with the guys later this week?

11:21.396 --> 11:23.185
I think so.

11:23.614 --> 11:26.434
- Who?
- We should.

11:27.134 --> 11:29.390
You should come too.

11:29.470 --> 11:31.993
I could introduce you to Derek...

11:32.073 --> 11:34.756
if you feel like it.

11:35.909 --> 11:37.834
Or not.

11:41.448 --> 11:44.654
Awesome, that sounds awesome.

11:56.050 --> 11:59.421
- I'm not feeling so great.
- Have you got your period?

11:59.701 --> 12:02.924
Yeah, I've just... I've gotta find a toilet.

12:03.004 --> 12:05.074
What about that one?

12:14.815 --> 12:16.705
Hey, Elliott!

12:17.285 --> 12:18.821
Hey.

12:20.621 --> 12:22.611
I'm sorry about before.

12:22.691 --> 12:26.996
- They totally put me on the spot.
- That's cool, I get it.

12:29.263 --> 12:32.921
If you're still interested,
did you want to hang out?

12:33.001 --> 12:34.956
Crap! I hate those dogs.

12:35.036 --> 12:37.975
That's where the triplets live.
They always do that.

12:40.675 --> 12:42.664
So did you wanna hang out?

12:42.744 --> 12:46.016
Are you kidding? Of course I wanna hang out.

12:49.050 --> 12:51.973
- I think my place is down this way.
- That's so funny.

12:52.053 --> 12:54.324
You don't even know where you live.

13:06.001 --> 13:07.722
Greta?

13:07.802 --> 13:09.318
Is that you?

13:13.106 --> 13:17.198
Mum, this is Elliott. Elliott, this is Mum.

13:17.678 --> 13:21.303
- Hello there, Elliott.
- Hello, Mrs. Driscoll.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.139
I love your house. It's gorgeous.

13:24.219 --> 13:28.591
Well, thank you, Elliott.
That's lovely of you to say.

13:32.026 --> 13:34.662
Holy crap balls! Is that you?

13:35.262 --> 13:37.285
You're so cute!

13:37.945 --> 13:39.667
Come on.

13:43.588 --> 13:46.135
Can I get you kids anything?

13:51.679 --> 13:54.224
- You've got plastic horses?
- Yeah.

13:54.304 --> 13:57.072
I can't believe it. I love plastic horses.

13:57.152 --> 13:58.714
- Really?
- They're like...

13:58.794 --> 14:00.809
almost the best thing in the world.

14:00.889 --> 14:03.978
I've got plastic pigs at home.
I collect plastic pigs.

14:04.058 --> 14:05.414
Really?

14:05.494 --> 14:07.682
- Did you make these?
- Yeah.

14:07.762 --> 14:11.434
How do you do that?
Those folds are so freaking little.

14:13.267 --> 14:16.324
See these? They're from my penpal in Finland.

14:16.404 --> 14:19.127
Finland? Oh, my God,
that is so freaking exotic.

14:19.207 --> 14:22.297
I know. We've been writing
to each other for ages.

14:22.377 --> 14:25.900
Her name's Greta too.
We love calling each other Greta.

14:26.380 --> 14:29.504
- Hello, Greta!
- Yes, hi, Greta.

14:29.584 --> 14:31.887
How are you today, Greta?

14:33.888 --> 14:35.342
I'll read you one.

14:38.825 --> 14:42.517
"Dearest Greta, how are you
in the land of sunshine, Greta?

14:42.597 --> 14:45.720
"Better, Greta, than freezing
in the winter of Helsinki.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.424
- "I wish I was there, Greta."
- Oh, my God, she is so awesome.

14:49.504 --> 14:51.391
I told you.

14:51.471 --> 14:53.327
Keep going.

14:55.076 --> 14:57.948
"I've sent you a copy of my favorite picture.

15:01.014 --> 15:03.797
"It's a Huldra, a wild warrior girl

15:03.877 --> 15:07.242
"who lives amongst the trees
in Finland and can never be tamed.

15:07.722 --> 15:10.779
"If you meet one walking
in the woods, you must be careful,

15:10.859 --> 15:14.915
"for if you are mean to her, she will
punish you with her leather fist of fury."

15:15.541 --> 15:18.369
- Hot.
- Can I show you one more thing?

15:18.449 --> 15:20.018
Yeah!

15:22.870 --> 15:25.426
My mum gave it to me on my fifth birthday.

15:25.506 --> 15:27.762
It was hers when she was little.

15:28.542 --> 15:31.843
Be careful. It's really old.
You don't want to get a splinter.

15:38.019 --> 15:40.938
I used to imagine
that it was from a faraway realm.

15:42.190 --> 15:43.896
<i>Cool.</i>

15:45.359 --> 15:47.797
<i>A realm where anything could happen.</i>

15:50.098 --> 15:53.588
Filled with mystical creatures
and stuffed with untold treasures.

15:54.469 --> 15:56.691
Sounds like the Vatican.

15:57.471 --> 16:00.775
And that the magic inside this tune
kept the entire realm safe

16:00.855 --> 16:03.606
<i>from the dangers
that lurked beyond its borders,</i>

16:03.686 --> 16:05.606
<i>hidden in the shadows.</i>

16:05.713 --> 16:08.150
<i>It's my most favorite thing in the world.</i>

16:12.452 --> 16:15.676
That was a long time ago.
I was just a kid back then.

16:15.756 --> 16:17.813
Lucky you're not a kid anymore, hey?

16:18.593 --> 16:21.864
No, seriously, your room is so awesome.

16:32.305 --> 16:35.934
It's easy with you, Greta.
Who needs those other idiots in our year?

16:36.144 --> 16:39.601
- I'm glad you're my friend.
- Yeah, me too, Elliott.

16:40.381 --> 16:42.184
Me too.

16:45.286 --> 16:48.843
- You kids all right in here?
- We're doing great, thanks, Mrs. Driscoll.

16:48.923 --> 16:52.327
Wonderful, that's just wonderful.

16:55.363 --> 16:58.219
You should stay for tea, Elliott.
I'm making Chinese.

16:58.299 --> 17:02.003
Really? I love Chinese.

17:03.236 --> 17:04.906
What?

17:10.044 --> 17:13.233
This is an excellent beef
and black bean sauce, Mrs. Driscoll.

17:13.314 --> 17:15.335
What cut did you use?

17:16.246 --> 17:18.520
- Chuck, I think.
- Chuck.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.089
Delicious.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.513
How do you like your school, Elliott?

17:26.594 --> 17:28.683
It's not too bad when you get the hang of it.

17:28.763 --> 17:30.599
That's wonderful.

17:31.782 --> 17:33.638
How do you think Greta will go?

17:33.968 --> 17:37.225
- Mum.
- She'll blitz it, no question.

17:37.805 --> 17:40.962
Greta's had her fair share
of problems at school before, Elliott.

17:41.042 --> 17:45.700
- That's why we're asking.
- Really? With like older kids?

17:45.780 --> 17:47.801
Ones her own age, too.

17:47.881 --> 17:50.286
Can we just eat and not talk, please?

18:02.763 --> 18:04.953
- And how old are you, Elliott?
- I'm 14.

18:05.033 --> 18:07.789
I'll be 15 in December. I can't wait.

18:08.369 --> 18:10.659
Greta's turning 15 soon.

18:11.039 --> 18:14.395
Hey, you should have like
an awesome party or something.

18:14.475 --> 18:17.498
- That'd be so awesome.
- No, it wouldn't.

18:18.578 --> 18:20.348
Conrad?

18:21.148 --> 18:23.892
Can you help me
with the pudding for a second?

18:37.030 --> 18:39.602
Good shot. You should play hockey.

18:41.234 --> 18:44.058
She needs encouraging.
She needs to come out of her shell.

18:44.138 --> 18:45.560
Janet, no!

18:45.640 --> 18:48.930
Come on. We need to strike
while the iron's hot.

18:49.010 --> 18:51.499
No! No, I don't think it's a good idea.

18:51.579 --> 18:54.803
She's ready. She just needs
a bit of a nudge, that's all.

18:54.883 --> 18:58.506
Who needs a nudge?
What are you talking about?

18:59.586 --> 19:01.256
Fudge.

19:02.089 --> 19:05.346
Just need some fudge, but we don't have any.

19:05.426 --> 19:08.396
- Do we, Conrad?
- No.

19:09.829 --> 19:11.834
No fudge here.

19:29.983 --> 19:32.974
- The bell has gone, move!
- Sorry, Miss Shitstick.

19:33.054 --> 19:36.144
- Excuse me? What did you say?
- Shiswick.

19:36.224 --> 19:40.128
I said, sorry, Miss Shiswick. Jesus!

19:42.170 --> 19:44.452
Come on, Gen,
I'm gonna get busted if I'm late.

19:44.532 --> 19:46.854
No, we wouldn't want her to get
busted now, would we, babes?

19:46.934 --> 19:49.416
No, she's definitely not ready for that.

19:56.510 --> 19:59.387
Pink slip, office, now.

19:59.963 --> 20:01.452
Awesome, thanks.

20:01.532 --> 20:04.737
Don't worry, the day's
about to get shittier anyway.

20:37.067 --> 20:40.239
Hello, yes! With bells on.

20:43.056 --> 20:46.895
This is gonna be so awesome.
I'm gonna wear a suit!

21:01.741 --> 21:03.763
Oh, God!

21:05.378 --> 21:07.248
Oh, God!

21:11.818 --> 21:15.009
It's just a little celebratory
get together, that's all.

21:15.089 --> 21:18.613
- But I don't want a party.
- Just be grateful, will you?

21:18.693 --> 21:20.681
I never got offered anything
when I was your age.

21:20.761 --> 21:23.618
All I got was, "Which Pizza Hut
do you wanna go to?"

21:23.698 --> 21:25.686
And what's wrong with Pizza Hut?

21:25.766 --> 21:28.350
The have puzzles on the place mats.
That's very clever.

21:29.070 --> 21:32.860
- What's all the hubbub in here?
- Jesus, put some clothes on!

21:32.940 --> 21:34.829
I told you I didn't want a party.

21:34.909 --> 21:39.388
We just want to meet more of your friends,
that's all. Show you off a little.

21:39.948 --> 21:43.671
You're becoming a beautiful young woman
but you always hide your light under a bushel.

21:43.751 --> 21:45.574
- What?
- I'll get you a new dress,

21:45.654 --> 21:48.110
and we'll get your hair
and makeup done. We can all do it!

21:48.190 --> 21:52.547
She doesn't need too much gussying up
though, does she? Not my little girl.

21:52.627 --> 21:55.282
- Mum, please don't do this.
- It's important.

21:55.962 --> 21:58.519
I just want you to come out
of your shell a little more.

21:58.599 --> 22:00.088
- It'll be good for you.
- But...

22:00.168 --> 22:03.792
No buts. It's happening, all right?
End of story.

22:04.272 --> 22:06.477
Dad, she's not even listening to me.

22:06.557 --> 22:08.546
I think you're overreacting
a little bit, pumpkin.

22:08.626 --> 22:11.242
- I'm not overreacting!
- You are.

22:12.145 --> 22:15.436
Do you wanna destroy my life?
I don't want a party!

22:15.516 --> 22:17.371
Your mum's already gone to a lot of trouble.

22:17.451 --> 22:19.940
- Neither of you are listening!
- Turn it down a bit, please.

22:20.020 --> 22:24.712
No! Get this through your thick skulls!
I don't want a party!

22:24.792 --> 22:28.713
- Greta!
- No fucking party, all right?

22:40.407 --> 22:42.277
You okay?

22:43.610 --> 22:45.030
No.

22:47.014 --> 22:49.003
What's going on?

22:49.083 --> 22:50.852
Come on.

22:55.122 --> 22:57.712
I hate seeing you like this, pumpkin.

22:59.092 --> 23:01.416
I miss my happy little girl.

23:01.796 --> 23:03.883
You remember her?

23:06.733 --> 23:08.803
Where'd she go?

23:10.203 --> 23:12.274
She's still here.

23:15.675 --> 23:18.566
Look, in the end it's up to you,

23:18.646 --> 23:21.369
but it'd mean the world to your mother.

23:21.449 --> 23:23.852
She's only trying to help.

23:38.298 --> 23:40.388
Just think about it.

23:40.468 --> 23:43.106
I'm sure you'll feel better about it later.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.870
Stop it! I said stop it!

23:55.950 --> 23:58.106
She's not ready for this.
She doesn't want a birthday.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.809
And you know what she wants, do you?
Don't touch me like that!

24:01.889 --> 24:03.644
- Jesus Christ.
- You know I hate it.

24:03.724 --> 24:06.228
- Well, am I that repulsive, am I?
- I can't talk to you.

24:06.308 --> 24:09.051
Yeah, well, if I disgust you that much...

24:34.854 --> 24:36.524
Hello?

24:52.106 --> 24:53.695
- Don't you dare!
- What else can I do?

24:53.775 --> 24:57.365
- How dare you say that to me?
- Jesus, you can be so cold sometimes.

24:57.445 --> 24:59.400
- This again!
- I'm just trying to tell you.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.003
- I don't want to hear anymore.
- Great.

25:01.083 --> 25:04.389
- I've had it, I've had enough.
- You're just gonna freeze me out then?

25:21.033 --> 25:23.271
I'm sorry about before.

25:28.968 --> 25:31.514
I wasn't doing it to be mean.

25:34.247 --> 25:36.117
I know.

25:38.251 --> 25:40.140
And you're right.

25:41.020 --> 25:43.091
I want the party.

25:59.974 --> 26:02.030
You won't regret this, darling.

26:02.610 --> 26:04.914
You won't regret this one little bit.

27:05.038 --> 27:08.209
Greta, Greta, get out here!

27:12.311 --> 27:14.316
What do you think?

27:16.016 --> 27:17.604
Hey?

27:25.059 --> 27:27.447
Genevieve, give me a hand
with these decorations, will you?

27:27.527 --> 27:30.847
- They're not gonna hang themselves, are they?
- I'm making a playlist, Janet.

27:30.927 --> 27:35.423
- None of that Benwit Tremit rubbish, please.
- It's Benoit Tremet.

27:35.503 --> 27:38.426
It's way too sexualized for my liking,
thank you very much.

27:38.506 --> 27:42.029
- What's wrong with a bit of sexy?
- Where do you want me to put this, Janet?

27:43.072 --> 27:45.232
Yeah, just put that outside, Adam, thank you.

27:45.312 --> 27:46.933
Sweet.

27:47.413 --> 27:51.337
Conrad! Did you get the ice?

27:51.417 --> 27:53.519
Sorry? What was that?

27:53.599 --> 27:55.210
Ice!

27:55.890 --> 27:57.607
Yeah.

27:57.957 --> 27:59.727
Ice.

28:13.173 --> 28:14.895
What are you doing?

28:14.975 --> 28:17.011
Are you okay?

28:17.844 --> 28:20.301
I should never have agreed to this.

28:20.781 --> 28:23.171
Well, you remember my 15th.

28:23.751 --> 28:27.632
Be careful. Weird shit can happen.

28:30.007 --> 28:31.964
Case in point. Come on.

28:33.394 --> 28:36.984
- Stop it.
- You do not look your age, Janet.

28:37.398 --> 28:39.754
Seriously, you two could be sisters.

28:42.569 --> 28:44.605
Give me that.

28:47.941 --> 28:50.987
- Hey, babes.
- You're not flirting with my mum, are you?

28:51.067 --> 28:54.234
Totally. All the ladies
in your family are hot.

28:54.314 --> 28:56.303
I have a husband, you know.

28:56.383 --> 28:59.239
I think I just threw up a little in my mouth.

28:59.319 --> 29:01.589
Can we keep moving, please?

29:02.456 --> 29:05.446
- Bloody hell!
- What have ya done?

29:05.726 --> 29:07.815
Who put the mousse on top of the ham?

29:07.895 --> 29:11.018
It wasn't set yet! Why were you moving it?

29:11.098 --> 29:13.887
All I did was open the bloody fridge!
It's not my bloody fault!

29:13.967 --> 29:16.204
I don't have time for this!

29:29.966 --> 29:33.988
Mum, no, please, no. I don't want to.

29:52.004 --> 29:53.674
So.

29:56.209 --> 29:58.298
What do you do?

29:58.378 --> 30:01.501
- I'm in carpet.
- Yeah, right.

30:02.181 --> 30:03.818
Carpet.

30:05.685 --> 30:07.755
Like Shag Pile?

30:09.555 --> 30:12.260
That's one of our lines.

30:15.812 --> 30:18.283
I hope you're both sitting down.

30:19.566 --> 30:21.235
Ready?

30:25.673 --> 30:27.342
What?

30:28.607 --> 30:30.864
I look horrible, don't I?

30:33.747 --> 30:36.036
You look beautiful, darling.

30:37.216 --> 30:39.287
You're so grown up.

30:42.156 --> 30:43.992
You're beautiful.

31:08.181 --> 31:09.798
- You...
- Don't say another word,

31:09.878 --> 31:13.001
or I will seriously punch you
in the frigging balls.

31:14.154 --> 31:17.544
None of this was my idea.
They've painted me up like a stupid doll.

31:17.624 --> 31:20.095
I don't even like wearing dresses.

31:27.033 --> 31:28.456
You can speak, you know?

31:28.536 --> 31:30.391
You said you were gonna
punch me in the balls.

31:30.471 --> 31:35.463
- You don't have to be so literal, Elliott.
- Good, 'cause I value my texticles.

31:35.543 --> 31:37.565
I just feel...

31:37.645 --> 31:40.868
- set upon, you know?
- Yeah, sure.

31:40.948 --> 31:45.239
I told them I didn't want a party.
I didn't want people I hardly knew here.

31:45.319 --> 31:48.909
I mean, they'll take one look at me
and think I'm a complete deadshit moron.

31:48.989 --> 31:50.725
Probably.

31:52.376 --> 31:54.832
- What do you think of my suit?
- It's nice.

31:54.912 --> 31:58.207
- I'd much rather wear that than this.
- Seriously?

31:58.487 --> 32:01.755
Yeah, I mean,
you might even get lucky tonight.

32:01.835 --> 32:04.592
- With who?
- I hear Denise Mackel might be coming.

32:04.672 --> 32:07.294
- She's got her eye on you, you know?
- Which one?

32:07.374 --> 32:09.778
Denise Mackel's got crazy eyes.

32:13.179 --> 32:14.949
Greta?

32:15.382 --> 32:18.839
My Godfather, people are arriving!
Somebody get that!

32:18.919 --> 32:20.507
God.

32:20.587 --> 32:23.444
Elliott! Get in here and help me
with these vol-au-vents.

32:23.524 --> 32:26.527
Greta, you can do this. I know you can.

32:27.627 --> 32:29.850
Are you using anchovy paste, Janet?

32:29.930 --> 32:33.938
You need to use anchovy paste,
if you're gonna get that right kind of salty.

34:19.405 --> 34:22.094
Hi, Greta, great party! Where's the party?

34:22.175 --> 34:25.996
Mum said I had to get you a present.
It's a cat. There's a cat in that box.

34:27.197 --> 34:30.487
Have you seen Elliott? Elliott's dreamy!

34:30.618 --> 34:33.107
- And where is he?
- In the kitchen, I think.

34:33.187 --> 34:37.275
I'm gonna try and get me
a piece of him later. Wish me luck.

34:38.056 --> 34:40.561
Oh, my God, Elliott!

34:41.393 --> 34:45.228
I'm gonna put you in a headlock!
Come here, dreamboat!

35:46.226 --> 35:48.030
Elliott!

36:03.714 --> 36:06.932
Amber, Jade, Saph.

36:07.012 --> 36:08.535
Ire.

36:08.615 --> 36:10.384
Sapphire.

36:10.883 --> 36:13.640
You guys came, I didn't think you would.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.938
To be completely honest...

36:16.162 --> 36:19.665
we were a little surprised
when we received our invitation.

36:20.493 --> 36:22.062
Weren't we?

36:23.762 --> 36:28.455
You see, we were under the impression
that you had no interest in us.

36:28.535 --> 36:30.925
You know, as friends.

36:32.605 --> 36:34.476
Why would you think that?

36:37.743 --> 36:40.300
We offered you an olive branch of friendship

36:40.380 --> 36:43.163
and when you decided you didn't want it...

36:43.683 --> 36:45.571
we were a little...

36:46.051 --> 36:48.323
how would you put it, Amber?

36:50.389 --> 36:51.859
Miffed.

36:52.525 --> 36:56.415
- Miffed?
- Miffed, dismayed...

36:56.495 --> 36:58.365
perturbed.

36:59.465 --> 37:01.755
The last one's an adjective.

37:02.535 --> 37:05.358
- Really?
- You've been totally avoiding us.

37:05.438 --> 37:07.761
It's kind of upsetting, you know?

37:07.941 --> 37:10.076
I'm so sorry.

37:10.156 --> 37:12.765
I had no idea how you guys felt.

37:12.845 --> 37:14.902
If I'd known, I would have just...

37:14.982 --> 37:18.037
I don't know, invited you guys
to hang out more often.

37:18.117 --> 37:20.474
Really? You're not just saying it?

37:20.554 --> 37:25.145
No way, why would I? You guys
have only ever said nice things to me.

37:25.225 --> 37:27.514
Well, yeah.

37:27.594 --> 37:29.448
That is true.

37:30.028 --> 37:32.467
We've only ever said nice things.

37:36.503 --> 37:38.792
A birthday present.

37:38.872 --> 37:41.262
Well, it's your birthday, isn't it?

37:42.242 --> 37:44.064
Is it a mix tape?

37:44.144 --> 37:47.189
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

37:49.548 --> 37:52.672
- Thanks.
- You're so welcome, hey.

37:53.652 --> 37:57.377
It's really nice of you guys to have come,
and thanks so much for the present.

37:57.457 --> 37:59.746
Really, I mean it.

38:00.026 --> 38:02.933
Hey, you should put it on.

38:06.950 --> 38:10.371
It's a song. We wrote it ourself.

38:12.538 --> 38:14.761
- Turn it up.
- <i>Is it recording?</i>

38:14.841 --> 38:16.777
<i>Okay, ready.</i>

38:17.276 --> 38:19.434
<i>This is for you, Greta.</i>

38:19.514 --> 38:24.394
<i>You've got no tits, you've got no tits</i>

38:24.494 --> 38:29.166
<i>No one will ever touch your bits</i>

38:29.251 --> 38:33.668
<i>You think you're so good,
you're a frigid bitch</i>

38:33.748 --> 38:38.788
<i>And your friend is a homo</i>

38:39.188 --> 38:42.512
<i>Your face looks like a pig</i>

38:42.612 --> 38:47.968
<i>And you wear clothes that make you look
like a 12-year-old boy</i>

38:48.068 --> 38:52.877
<i>You've got no tits, you've got no tits</i>

38:52.977 --> 38:59.119
<i>No one will ever touch your bits</i>

39:00.852 --> 39:04.077
That's for running off on me and my sisters.

39:04.757 --> 39:06.980
We could've been friends.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.630
Happy birthday, bitch.

39:16.268 --> 39:17.938
Ladies...

39:21.140 --> 39:23.144
better not scratch my duco.

39:41.261 --> 39:45.185
What are you doing? Everyone's looking
for you. It's your party, you know.

39:45.265 --> 39:48.222
I know, I just needed a breather.

39:48.602 --> 39:51.991
You got a mix tape?
That's an awesome present. What's on it?

39:52.071 --> 39:54.361
You know, just the usual stuff.

39:54.441 --> 39:58.345
I've got the best present for you.
I'm not gonna give it to you yet, though.

40:00.347 --> 40:02.570
I don't know, maybe I should.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.589
God. Deep breath.

40:07.219 --> 40:11.659
Greta, I've been thinking,
like, more than normal.

40:12.324 --> 40:14.282
There's something I want to tell you.

40:15.362 --> 40:18.216
I'm not sure if this is
the right time to bring this up, but...

40:18.296 --> 40:22.022
you're my best friend.
You're totally my best friend.

40:22.102 --> 40:25.306
- Yeah?
- Well, I'm your best friend too, aren't I?

40:26.406 --> 40:28.095
You're my only friend, Elliott.

40:28.175 --> 40:31.573
That's so not true. Have you seen
how many people there are here?

40:33.280 --> 40:36.546
Doesn't matter. God, what am I trying to say?

40:38.150 --> 40:42.224
You're my best friend,
and I'd never want to risk our friendship.

40:45.791 --> 40:50.647
I would never want to risk our friendship,
but some things are worth risking.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.336
What are you trying to say?

40:58.236 --> 41:01.975
I... wanna be more than just friends.

41:04.843 --> 41:07.300
You look amazing tonight.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.502
What are you doing?

41:09.582 --> 41:13.391
I've been feeling this way for a while,
and when I saw you in that dress.

41:15.921 --> 41:18.545
- Say something will you?
- Well, what? What do you want me to say?

41:18.625 --> 41:20.680
That you wanna be more than just friends too?

41:20.760 --> 41:22.582
Why would I do that?

41:22.662 --> 41:24.760
I don't know, I just thought,
'cause we'd been hanging...

41:24.840 --> 41:26.920
You thought, did you?
You thought you'd just come in here,

41:27.000 --> 41:29.322
and I'd throw myself
at your feet, is that it?

41:29.402 --> 41:32.080
Jeez, Greta, that's a bit harsh.
I'm just saying.

41:32.160 --> 41:36.129
Then tell me I'm being a bitch. Go on.
That's what you really wanna say, isn't it?

41:36.409 --> 41:37.697
Greta.

41:37.777 --> 41:39.966
Everyone says you're a homo, anyway.

41:40.046 --> 41:42.337
Why would I be interested
in someone like you?

41:44.617 --> 41:47.607
Go on, tell me I'm being a frigid bitch.

41:47.687 --> 41:49.891
I know you're thinking it.

41:55.562 --> 41:57.431
Oh, God!

42:08.924 --> 42:10.961
What the hell?

42:45.277 --> 42:47.595
Hey, that's mine, give it back!

42:51.518 --> 42:53.351
I said, give it back!

43:22.549 --> 43:23.994
Give it back!

43:37.247 --> 43:39.736
Who's a little bolter, hey?

43:40.466 --> 43:43.704
Who's a fast little run-run-runner?

43:50.809 --> 43:52.612
Come on.

43:55.565 --> 43:57.434
What the hell?

43:58.517 --> 44:00.187
Hey!

44:51.770 --> 44:53.861
You're not safe here.

44:54.441 --> 44:56.309
Come on!

44:58.010 --> 44:59.766
What the hell was that thing?

44:59.846 --> 45:02.569
Was it a dog? Did you kill it?

45:02.949 --> 45:05.438
It was about to attack me, wasn't it?

45:05.518 --> 45:08.141
That was unbelievable.
That was freaking unbelievable.

45:08.221 --> 45:10.677
- I can't stop shaking.
- Shut up!

45:11.007 --> 45:13.062
You're too loud.

45:13.592 --> 45:15.462
This way.

45:23.935 --> 45:25.504
Wash.

45:25.837 --> 45:27.976
It'll put them off your scent.

45:30.826 --> 45:32.595
Do it!

45:34.280 --> 45:36.536
There's more of them?

45:36.616 --> 45:38.771
It was after me, wasn't it?

45:38.851 --> 45:41.807
- It was hunting you.
- Hunting me?

45:41.887 --> 45:45.345
From here on in, you don't leave my side.

45:45.425 --> 45:47.194
Understood?

45:51.496 --> 45:52.766
Come on.

46:16.188 --> 46:18.258
You live here?

46:19.224 --> 46:22.649
- Why?
- My house is just near here.

46:22.729 --> 46:25.118
There's heaps of houses near here.

46:25.198 --> 46:27.798
No one can just live in a forest.

46:30.135 --> 46:32.005
I do.

46:33.822 --> 46:35.892
This is my home.

46:37.159 --> 46:40.706
This is my forest. I know this place,
and you're not a part of it.

46:41.614 --> 46:43.818
So why are you here, then?

46:49.354 --> 46:51.759
You have no idea, do you?

46:53.091 --> 46:56.784
Somebody stole something from me,
and I came here to get it back.

46:58.064 --> 47:00.487
You're not ready for this place, are you?

47:00.767 --> 47:03.473
- You're still just a little girl.
- I am not!

47:03.553 --> 47:07.308
- A helpless baby.
- Don't call me that!

47:44.576 --> 47:47.414
"Find the girl with the tiny hands."

47:49.414 --> 47:51.251
Get ready.

47:55.136 --> 47:57.575
You're going back where you came from.

48:16.007 --> 48:18.479
It's my gate, it's my back gate!

48:52.561 --> 48:54.230
Run?

48:56.933 --> 48:58.302
Run!

49:14.801 --> 49:16.870
Get on his back!

49:22.407 --> 49:24.229
Hold on!

49:24.309 --> 49:26.079
Tighter!

50:01.880 --> 50:03.650
Elliott!

50:04.683 --> 50:06.452
Elliott!

50:07.585 --> 50:09.355
Elliott!

50:16.461 --> 50:18.666
Greta, where are you?

50:20.766 --> 50:22.520
Elliott!

50:22.600 --> 50:24.120
Elliott!

50:24.536 --> 50:27.962
Are you okay? I thought I lost you.

50:30.959 --> 50:34.935
- How'd you get over here?
- I followed you from your house.

50:39.551 --> 50:41.655
Greta, what's wrong?

50:43.138 --> 50:44.582
Get away.

50:45.224 --> 50:48.514
I don't understand. Greta?

50:48.994 --> 50:50.861
Get away!

50:53.766 --> 50:57.030
What's wrong? It's me, Elliott.

50:58.169 --> 51:01.294
Bugger, thought that would work.

51:01.674 --> 51:04.745
No, no, don't be scared. I only want to talk.

51:06.878 --> 51:09.449
What about this one? What about this?

51:11.550 --> 51:13.820
I've got bums in my armpits.

51:16.560 --> 51:19.312
What's that? What's that behind your ear?

51:19.392 --> 51:21.647
Is it a rose, or what is it?

51:21.727 --> 51:23.483
It's a...

51:23.863 --> 51:25.799
It was just a fart.

51:27.266 --> 51:29.323
You should get that checked.

51:33.571 --> 51:35.641
Pretty funny guy, huh?

51:36.241 --> 51:40.133
- What do you want?
- Just to be helpful. That's all.

51:40.213 --> 51:42.935
- You're a freak.
- I'm a freak?

51:43.015 --> 51:46.224
You're the freakin' freak,
ya freaked out freakin' freak face.

51:48.220 --> 51:51.192
I'm not an idiot. I saw you before.

51:52.924 --> 51:56.230
I don't even know what you're talking about.

51:58.763 --> 52:00.974
She stole my music box.

52:01.534 --> 52:03.737
She wouldn't do that.

52:04.769 --> 52:06.392
Well, where is she?

52:06.472 --> 52:09.810
If you wanna help me, tell me where she is.

52:11.676 --> 52:13.699
I can't do that.

52:14.079 --> 52:16.419
- Sorry.
- You're wasting my time.

52:16.499 --> 52:18.887
But I haven't even shown you my best trick.

52:20.053 --> 52:22.208
What about this one? Pull my finger.

52:22.288 --> 52:24.978
- No.
- Yeah, go on, go on, pull it.

52:38.404 --> 52:41.291
Bugger. Don't be scared!

52:42.825 --> 52:45.372
I only wanna protect you!

52:47.812 --> 52:49.783
Take ya somewhere safe.

52:51.116 --> 52:54.006
We could have tea parties and dress ups
and play with your horsies.

52:54.086 --> 52:56.190
You love your horsies!

53:02.193 --> 53:04.531
I'm only trying to help you!

53:06.097 --> 53:08.405
Why won't you let me help you?

53:50.075 --> 53:52.063
Hey, lady!

53:52.143 --> 53:55.415
Have you seen my music box?

53:59.518 --> 54:01.622
Why are you smashing them?

54:03.539 --> 54:05.208
Why?

54:07.226 --> 54:11.401
Because they were not the right one.

54:12.898 --> 54:15.972
They were not the beautiful song...

54:16.052 --> 54:19.557
the one I remember from my youth.

54:19.637 --> 54:23.842
Full of promise and love.

54:27.245 --> 54:29.769
What's happening?

54:29.849 --> 54:33.152
What are you doing to me?

54:36.806 --> 54:38.474
Us.

54:40.024 --> 54:42.728
I have to go.

54:44.212 --> 54:47.883
You and I... we're the same.

54:48.600 --> 54:51.223
You're just like me now.

54:51.303 --> 54:54.006
You're just like me.

54:55.390 --> 54:58.894
You're just like me.

55:17.795 --> 55:19.818
You're safe, I'm here.

55:22.533 --> 55:26.059
I know this is some scary shit,
but you have to stay strong.

55:26.939 --> 55:30.478
In the end, you're the only one
that can do this.

55:33.111 --> 55:34.781
Greta?

55:35.546 --> 55:37.485
Greta, wake up.

55:37.565 --> 55:39.553
Don't move.

55:40.653 --> 55:44.510
He's behind you to your left.
He thinks you're still unconscious.

55:46.192 --> 55:48.647
When you come to,
he's gonna try and take you away.

55:48.727 --> 55:50.783
But that's not gonna happen, all right?

55:50.863 --> 55:53.219
How do I get past him?

55:53.299 --> 55:55.154
I'll take care of him.

55:55.234 --> 55:58.457
He won't hurt you, but they will.

55:58.537 --> 56:01.060
And they're gonna be here any second.

56:01.440 --> 56:05.847
Head east across the river.
Follow the boy and don't turn back, okay?

56:06.658 --> 56:10.052
Take this. Wrap it tight, it'll protect you.

56:10.132 --> 56:12.836
And when you punch, punch hard.

56:15.720 --> 56:17.490
Ready?

56:27.762 --> 56:29.355
Go!

56:29.435 --> 56:31.488
No, what are you doing? No!

57:36.234 --> 57:38.672
Go! Run!

58:58.983 --> 59:00.720
Bonsoir, Greta.

59:01.953 --> 59:03.990
Benoit Tremet?

59:08.767 --> 59:12.084
I'm sorry, I don't understand French.

59:12.164 --> 59:14.620
And I don't understand English.

59:14.700 --> 59:17.903
- What?
- I'm sorry, Greta, but this is my humor.

59:19.171 --> 59:20.840
Okay.

59:21.939 --> 59:23.943
Crazy party?

59:25.843 --> 59:28.099
Lucky you fell asleep.

59:28.479 --> 59:31.202
- Me?
- Yes, you.

59:31.282 --> 59:33.406
You are in the snooze mode.

59:33.786 --> 59:36.789
I don't blame you. Parties can be hell.

59:39.491 --> 59:41.762
I can't be asleep.

59:48.767 --> 59:50.888
Like a baby.

59:50.968 --> 59:53.239
Where are we, then?

59:55.707 --> 59:58.111
We are in your bedroom.

01:00:00.311 --> 01:00:02.481
Just you and me.

01:00:03.647 --> 01:00:07.639
I don't understand.
I have to find my music box.

01:00:09.254 --> 01:00:11.610
That song is no good to you anymore.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:14.011
This song...

01:00:14.091 --> 01:00:16.948
my song, can be yours now.

01:00:17.128 --> 01:00:19.418
All yours, ma cherie.

01:00:19.498 --> 01:00:22.440
But I don't want your song. I want my own.

01:00:24.335 --> 01:00:26.939
You look so beautiful in that dress.

01:00:33.444 --> 01:00:35.761
Now we're talking.

01:00:37.816 --> 01:00:40.786
Such incroyable beauty.

01:00:42.553 --> 01:00:47.123
I can hardly control my desire
when I see such a beautiful woman.

01:00:48.526 --> 01:00:50.884
This is making me feel uncomfortable.

01:00:52.364 --> 01:00:54.019
Do you feel it too?

01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:56.789
I know you do.

01:00:56.869 --> 01:00:58.704
You feel it.

01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:01.975
Just like I feel it.

01:01:04.675 --> 01:01:08.167
You're my best friend
and I never wanna risk our friendship.

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:10.250
What the hell?

01:01:16.187 --> 01:01:18.592
I wanna be more than just friends.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.016
You look amazing tonight, Greta.

01:01:24.896 --> 01:01:27.186
I wanna touch you all over.

01:01:27.266 --> 01:01:31.290
I wanna touch you and kiss you
and make sweet, sweet love.

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:33.891
This isn't happening, you're not Elliott!

01:01:48.186 --> 01:01:50.590
Listen to your new song, Greta.

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:54.961
Feel it in your heart.

01:01:56.961 --> 01:01:59.332
Feel it in your body.

01:02:01.465 --> 01:02:04.189
- I don't want this.
- Yes, you do.

01:02:04.669 --> 01:02:06.539
You do.

01:02:07.404 --> 01:02:09.695
You came through the gate, Greta.

01:02:11.175 --> 01:02:13.379
You wanted to be here.

01:02:17.315 --> 01:02:20.753
- Fuck you!
- Only if you ask nice.

01:02:23.951 --> 01:02:25.452
Now...

01:02:26.624 --> 01:02:28.828
I'm gonna make you a woman.

01:02:31.413 --> 01:02:35.050
I'm sorry, Greta. I'm so sorry.

01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:13.571
So, are you gonna come
rollerskating with us or not?

01:03:15.071 --> 01:03:18.396
- Not this time.
- What if I don't feel like it?

01:03:18.476 --> 01:03:20.914
What do you think, pig?

01:03:24.866 --> 01:03:27.789
I don't care what you guys do to me anymore.

01:03:27.869 --> 01:03:29.906
Bring it on, bitches!

01:05:22.299 --> 01:05:24.321
Give it back!

01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:28.293
Are you deaf? I said give it back!

01:05:28.373 --> 01:05:29.712
Now!

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:48.761
Me? You're me?

01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:55.200
All this?

01:05:57.067 --> 01:05:58.823
It was you?

01:05:58.903 --> 01:06:01.440
No, silly, it was you.

01:07:00.114 --> 01:07:04.099
Can you stay with me till I fall asleep?

01:07:11.342 --> 01:07:13.812
You've got a splinter.

01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:18.584
Got it.

01:07:50.397 --> 01:07:52.053
Hey.

01:07:52.383 --> 01:07:54.419
Are you okay?

01:08:02.426 --> 01:08:05.464
I know. I heard.

01:08:06.196 --> 01:08:08.420
I did nothing to them.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.192
I know. They're nasty, and they're scared.

01:08:14.272 --> 01:08:16.426
No, they're not.

01:08:16.506 --> 01:08:19.345
Believe me, Greta, they are.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.350
You remember when I was turning 15...

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.301
and I stopped talking to everyone?

01:08:29.252 --> 01:08:33.243
I don't know what it was. I just woke up
one morning and things were different.

01:08:33.323 --> 01:08:36.381
It was like some new person
had turned up inside my body

01:08:36.461 --> 01:08:38.683
and kicked the old one out.

01:08:38.763 --> 01:08:41.120
And there was nothing I could do about it.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.091
I know what you're going through now is shit.

01:08:46.171 --> 01:08:50.027
Confusing and you're...
pretty much hating it.

01:08:50.707 --> 01:08:53.179
You're not alone, all right?

01:08:59.582 --> 01:09:01.537
And this?

01:09:01.618 --> 01:09:03.788
This never existed.

01:09:06.723 --> 01:09:08.727
Thanks, Gen.

01:09:09.593 --> 01:09:10.715
Come on.

01:09:10.795 --> 01:09:14.334
You should go downstairs, otherwise
Adam might crack onto Mum again.

01:09:47.731 --> 01:09:50.569
- That was pretty.
- About before... Sorry.

01:09:51.268 --> 01:09:53.057
You go first.

01:09:53.136 --> 01:09:54.549
Okay.

01:09:55.405 --> 01:09:58.446
You had no right to call me a homo before.

01:09:58.526 --> 01:10:02.323
I mean, there's absolutely nothing wrong
with being gay. I'd be totally fine if I was,

01:10:02.403 --> 01:10:06.074
but the point is... A, I don't think
you meant it as a compliment,

01:10:06.154 --> 01:10:08.932
and B, I actually do like girls.
I think about them way too much.

01:10:09.012 --> 01:10:11.863
Like six or seven times a day,
I think about girls,

01:10:11.943 --> 01:10:15.078
- and I... well, wait.
- I get the point.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.449
Right.

01:10:18.529 --> 01:10:21.019
Which brings me to my next point...

01:10:21.299 --> 01:10:25.556
which is that I declared my interest for you.

01:10:26.036 --> 01:10:29.575
I'm sorry for what I said. It was cruel.

01:10:31.408 --> 01:10:34.832
Right. Good, okay.

01:10:34.912 --> 01:10:37.602
I was gonna make that point, too,

01:10:37.682 --> 01:10:40.405
which I'm glad you've also made...

01:10:40.485 --> 01:10:42.007
already.

01:10:42.087 --> 01:10:44.276
You're my best friend.

01:10:44.756 --> 01:10:45.877
That's what I thought.

01:10:45.957 --> 01:10:49.581
But you being my best friend
is the best thing in the world to me.

01:10:50.461 --> 01:10:52.951
You're so close to my heart.

01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:57.622
But what I said before, that kind
of changes things now, doesn't it?

01:10:57.702 --> 01:10:59.771
Between us?

01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:02.360
But that's okay, isn't it?

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.710
Things changing a bit.

01:11:05.776 --> 01:11:08.246
Yeah, I guess.

01:11:13.984 --> 01:11:16.507
So, should we do it?

01:11:16.587 --> 01:11:18.376
Should we go in?

01:11:18.456 --> 01:11:20.325
I guess.

01:11:21.591 --> 01:11:23.963
Can I ask you a favor first?

01:11:28.882 --> 01:11:30.552
Greta?

01:11:31.235 --> 01:11:32.905
Greta!

01:11:41.778 --> 01:11:43.048
Greta!

01:11:50.655 --> 01:11:53.144
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

01:11:53.224 --> 01:11:56.116
I look so much better in this dress than you!

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:03.455
- What was that for?
- I'm glad you're my friend.

01:12:03.935 --> 01:12:06.266
- Me too.
- Come on.

01:12:06.346 --> 01:12:09.661
There you are. What in God's name?

01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:11.863
- Hi, Janet.
- How's it going, Janet?

01:12:11.943 --> 01:12:14.198
I'm not even going to ask.

01:12:14.578 --> 01:12:16.768
Quickly, your father's about to do the cake.

01:12:16.848 --> 01:12:18.502
Mum?

01:12:18.716 --> 01:12:20.419
Are you all right?

01:12:21.519 --> 01:12:24.109
- Go.
- No, seriously.

01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:26.425
Are you all right?

01:12:27.341 --> 01:12:28.877
Of course.

01:12:34.731 --> 01:12:36.601
Go on.

01:13:23.147 --> 01:13:24.902
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

01:13:24.982 --> 01:13:27.652
- Hip!
- Hooray!

01:13:52.565 --> 01:13:54.833
I stayed up all night last night.

01:13:55.463 --> 01:13:57.772
- Really?
- I was wondering where the sun went.

01:13:57.852 --> 01:14:00.321
And then it dawned on me.

01:14:00.701 --> 01:14:03.441
- Five.
- Five? Why only five?

01:14:03.521 --> 01:14:05.624
Can we just not? Please?

01:14:06.356 --> 01:14:09.494
Half an hour, that's all I ask.

01:14:54.938 --> 01:14:58.893
Good donuts. Donuts are the best,
don't you think?

01:15:02.078 --> 01:15:04.783
Awesome, awesome donuts.
