00:02.834 --> 00:05.336
? Boy, the way Glenn Miller played ?

00:05.404 --> 00:09.140
? songs that made the hit parade ?

00:09.208 --> 00:12.843

00:56.288 --> 00:57.322
[sighing]

00:57.389 --> 01:00.291
Oh, hello, my darling.

01:00.359 --> 01:02.327
You look a little tired.

01:02.394 --> 01:05.462
What you need is some tender loving care.

01:06.332 --> 01:08.032
Do we have time, Gloria?

01:11.503 --> 01:14.573
I was talking to moss plant, honey. Oh, oh.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.973
You're the one that first taught me

01:16.041 --> 01:18.143
that plants really respond
to love and affection.

01:18.210 --> 01:21.179
That's true, that's true, so do husbands.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.314
(Gloria) Oh, oh not now, honey.

01:23.382 --> 01:25.750
Why? Come on, nobody's here. No, come on.

01:25.817 --> 01:27.418
Gloria, you won't even show your husband

01:27.486 --> 01:29.854
the same attention you show your fern.

01:31.356 --> 01:34.926
Oh, oh, ok.

01:34.994 --> 01:37.329
[Cooing] Hello, my honey!

01:37.396 --> 01:39.431
[Laughing]

01:39.498 --> 01:42.167
What, are you cooling off
the red hot lover there?

01:44.170 --> 01:47.638
Why don't you take him outside
and turn the hose on him?

01:47.706 --> 01:50.808
Recreation break's over, the warden's back.

01:50.876 --> 01:53.144
Hi, ma. I made you some coffee.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.781
Oh, how was the funeral?
Oh, it was very nice.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.885
Didn't you think it was, Archie?

02:00.952 --> 02:04.755
Ah, well, Edith, funerals are all the
same, one's just like the next one.

02:04.823 --> 02:07.758
The only thing different
is the dearly departeds.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.928
It was a lovely service.

02:10.996 --> 02:13.998
And the reverend felcher
said such nice things

02:14.066 --> 02:16.401
about poor Joe hoffsinger.

02:16.468 --> 02:21.105
Wherever Joe is, I'm sure his
ears must have been burning.

02:23.975 --> 02:26.444
Oh, did you go to the cemetery?

02:26.512 --> 02:28.913
Oh, no, Joe ain't being buried.

02:28.981 --> 02:30.314
What are they gonna do with him?

02:30.382 --> 02:32.117
He's gonna be incremated.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.990
Daddy, "cremated."

02:39.058 --> 02:40.391
Ain't that what I said?

02:40.459 --> 02:42.460
[Blowing a raspberry]

02:42.528 --> 02:44.528
And they're gonna keep his
ashes around the house

02:44.597 --> 02:46.397
in one of them silver urinals.

02:53.705 --> 02:55.673
And, by the way,

02:55.741 --> 02:58.342
don't you never do that to me.

02:58.410 --> 03:01.012
Oh, no, Archie, I promise.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.548
Oh, you got something against cremation?

03:03.616 --> 03:07.084
No, but with your mother-in-law, I'd
probably wind up in the vacuum cleaner.

03:09.955 --> 03:12.289
Poor old Joe hoffsinger.

03:12.357 --> 03:15.994
Here today, gone tomorrow.
That's the way it is.

03:16.061 --> 03:18.262
Another victim of the grim weeper.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.600
Sure makes you think about life, though.

03:22.668 --> 03:24.769
Jeez, you get married,
you work your butt off

03:24.837 --> 03:26.504
all your life to support your family.

03:26.571 --> 03:28.873
And what's your big reward in the end?

03:28.941 --> 03:31.242
Every Wednesday, the widow shines you up

03:31.310 --> 03:35.480
along with the rest of the brics
and bracs on the mantle board.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.049
It's hard to believe him dying like that.

03:38.116 --> 03:40.518
Mr. hoffsinger always looked so healthy.

03:40.586 --> 03:43.321
Oh, Joe took pretty good care of himself.

03:43.389 --> 03:47.592
Yeah, his wife told me he was
always taking vitamin pills,

03:47.660 --> 03:52.397
and eating sunflower seeds,
and drinking goat's milk.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.031
Then how did he die?

03:54.099 --> 03:56.968
He dropped dead jogging home
from the health food store.

04:00.673 --> 04:04.442
Poor Joe. You know what bothered me?

04:04.510 --> 04:08.412
His son, Bernard, didn't
even come to the funeral.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.549
And that was a disgrace.

04:11.617 --> 04:15.053
Well, ma, weren't you the one to
tell me that they never got along?

04:15.121 --> 04:18.956
Oh, well, how the hell you gonna
get along with a kid like Bernard,

04:19.091 --> 04:21.125
with his painted toenails,
carrying a purse,

04:21.192 --> 04:22.861
and whiskers down to his bellybutton?

04:24.396 --> 04:26.030
He's a musician.

04:26.098 --> 04:29.934
Musician? What are you talking about?
The guy's a jerk.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.169
Plays in one of them rock groups.

04:32.237 --> 04:33.938
That's a good name for them, too.

04:34.006 --> 04:37.675
They all look like they crawled
out from under a group of rocks.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.913
Daddy, maybe Bernard had a good reason

04:41.981 --> 04:43.581
for not being at the funeral.

04:43.716 --> 04:47.151
There ain't no good reason for a
thing like that, little girl,

04:47.219 --> 04:49.520
after the old man working
hard for him all of his life.

04:49.588 --> 04:51.488
He wanted to take Bernard
into the business.

04:51.556 --> 04:53.858
And it was a very good business.

04:53.925 --> 04:55.126
What business was that?

04:55.194 --> 04:57.028
He was an exterminator.

04:58.030 --> 05:00.165
You should've seen his truck.

05:00.232 --> 05:02.466
It was covered with all kinds of pictures

05:02.534 --> 05:04.068
of the different kinds of bugs

05:04.136 --> 05:06.004
he could kill for you.

05:06.071 --> 05:10.074
And laying on top was this
big rubber cockroach.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.712
And every time Joe drove down the street,

05:14.780 --> 05:18.482
its little legs would go flying around,

05:18.550 --> 05:21.586
like it was alive.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.254
Bernard could've had all of that.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.626
How about a little lunch there, huh, Edith?

05:28.693 --> 05:30.595
Oh, ma, I got everything ready.

05:30.662 --> 05:33.564
Oh, thanks, Gloria, I'll help you.

05:33.632 --> 05:36.267
Yeah, poor old Joe hoffsinger.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.737
Well, what the hell, he's up there now.

05:39.538 --> 05:42.439
In the attic?

05:42.507 --> 05:45.576
No, don't be a smart guy, heaven.
And you know I meant heaven.

05:45.644 --> 05:47.344
He's in heaven.

05:47.412 --> 05:50.414
St. Peter's up there measuring
him for his wings right now.

05:50.482 --> 05:52.250
You mean those wings are tailor-made?

05:52.317 --> 05:55.286
I always thought they came off the rack.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.989
Don't try and be a wise guy, will you?

05:58.057 --> 05:59.457
Do you really believe that stuff?

05:59.524 --> 06:01.526
I most certainly do.

06:01.594 --> 06:03.394
I read my Bible and it's in my Bible.

06:03.461 --> 06:06.630
Guys who go to heaven get wings.
Now leave me alone!

06:06.698 --> 06:08.699
Fine, arch, suppose there is a heaven,

06:08.767 --> 06:12.536
and suppose when you get up there,
you're not met by St. Peter.

06:12.604 --> 06:15.072
You're met by a rabbi. What would you do?

06:15.140 --> 06:16.774
I'd drop dead.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.116
But that's a stupid "supposing
if," because everybody knows

06:25.184 --> 06:27.919
that in heaven there ain't no
differences of race or color.

06:27.986 --> 06:30.154
Everybody's equal, white christians.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.426
What about hell, are there any
white christians in hell?

06:35.493 --> 06:38.062
You better be careful or
you're gonna find out.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.398
Let me tell you something, you
ain't got no respect in you.

06:40.465 --> 06:43.001
That's the trouble with Joe
hoffsinger's son Bernard.

06:43.068 --> 06:45.737
That's the thanks Joe got, after
bringing that kid into the world.

06:45.804 --> 06:48.740
What thanks should he get? I mean,
gee, I think if you bring a kid

06:48.807 --> 06:50.674
into the world nowadays,
you owe an apology.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.978
I know, if it was up to me, I wouldn't
be born into this rotten world.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.847
What's the matter with the world today?

06:55.914 --> 06:58.016
Well, for one thing, it's too crowded.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.717
Not for me, if it's too crowded for you,

06:59.785 --> 07:03.087
why don't you step off of it?

07:03.155 --> 07:06.090
Arch, there are over 4 billion
people in the world today.

07:06.158 --> 07:08.092
We don't have food to feed half of them.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.095
And in 25 years, Asia alone
is gonna have 4 billion.

07:11.163 --> 07:12.864
Who's gonna take care of all those people?

07:13.098 --> 07:14.999
God.

07:15.066 --> 07:17.568
Oh, well, t-that's a relief.
How's he gonna do that?

07:17.636 --> 07:20.138
Like he always done it in the past.

07:20.205 --> 07:22.339
Anytime he figured the world was too full,

07:22.407 --> 07:25.376
God, in his infinite mercy, gave us wars,

07:25.444 --> 07:28.646
or earthquakes, floods,

07:28.714 --> 07:32.583
diseases, and pestilentiaries like that.

07:32.651 --> 07:35.887
It's nice to have an intelligent
conversation with you.

07:35.921 --> 07:37.488
(Edith) Food's on.

07:37.555 --> 07:39.957
You don't really mean that,
because the trouble with you is,

07:40.025 --> 07:42.693
like I said before, that
you ain't got no respect.

07:42.761 --> 07:44.962
Arch, respect has to be earned.

07:45.030 --> 07:47.932
So does a living, but that
don't mean nothing to you.

07:50.034 --> 07:53.036
I'm telling you right now, there's
a big "hate your parents" movement

07:53.104 --> 07:54.838
going on in this country

07:54.906 --> 07:57.375
in the U.S. of a., but it wasn't
an American that started it.

07:57.442 --> 08:00.678
It was a German head shrinker
by the name of Sigmund froos.

08:03.382 --> 08:07.652
Freud only said that parents
can create a lot of problems.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.186
Oh, he's wacky.

08:09.255 --> 08:12.190
Parents create children and
children create the problems,

08:12.257 --> 08:14.024
including you, little girl.

08:14.092 --> 08:16.394
Me? What problems did I ever cause?

08:16.461 --> 08:18.896
Well, tip a glance to your right there.

08:20.465 --> 08:22.132
That's not funny, arch.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.735
No, it's sad and it's terrible.

08:24.803 --> 08:27.138
Daddy, I didn't ask to be born.

08:27.206 --> 08:29.840
Oh, well, now you're here, I
mean, what're we gonna do,

08:29.908 --> 08:33.443
get your vote? Look at this. See, see
this is the appreciation you get

08:33.510 --> 08:35.980
for making a big decision to
bring a kid into this world.

08:36.081 --> 08:38.048
Oh, big decision. Come off it, arch.

08:38.116 --> 08:39.616
The only reason a lot of people have kids

08:39.683 --> 08:42.820
is because they forget to
make a trip to the drugstore.

09:07.846 --> 09:09.713
Can't you keep your mouth
shut about nothing?

09:09.781 --> 09:11.149
I didn't say nothing.

09:11.216 --> 09:12.216
Oh.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.187
Oh, ma.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.957
You know how you used to always call me
your little pink bundle from heaven?

09:19.992 --> 09:21.325
Well, you can't do that anymore

09:21.393 --> 09:24.127
'cause I just found out I
was a surprise package.

09:26.431 --> 09:30.601
Well, now you know, kind
of keep it indoors, huh?

09:30.669 --> 09:32.703
Things like that happen
in the best of families.

09:32.771 --> 09:34.972
Well, that won't happen to
me and Michael, huh, honey?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.274
That's right. We're not
gonna have any kids.

09:37.342 --> 09:38.809
What?

09:38.877 --> 09:40.645
I said, we're not gonna
have any kids. What?

09:40.712 --> 09:42.413
You don't mean that.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.482
Oh, no, ma. He means
while we're living here.

09:44.549 --> 09:46.016
(Archie) What?

09:46.084 --> 09:47.951
No, Gloria, I mean we're not
gonna have any kids, period.

09:48.019 --> 09:50.121
What? You didn't talk about
that when we got married.

09:50.188 --> 09:51.155
What?

09:52.424 --> 09:54.625
A lot of things have changed since then.

09:54.692 --> 09:58.028
What did you do, meathead,
sneak off to some chiropractor

09:58.096 --> 09:59.797
and get yourself fixed?

10:04.969 --> 10:09.339
No, arch, I just don't feel it's right
to bring kids into the world today.

10:09.407 --> 10:11.742
Just like that, you decide we're
not gonna have any children?

10:11.810 --> 10:15.012
Not just like that, Gloria. I've been
thinkin' about it for a long time.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.082
Michael, why didn't you just at least
discuss it with your wife first?

10:18.150 --> 10:20.284
He didn't discuss it with me, neither.

10:21.653 --> 10:23.021
I was gonna tell you!

10:23.088 --> 10:25.689
Tell me? How about ask me?

10:25.757 --> 10:28.926
I thought our marriage was a
partnership, not a dictatorship.

10:28.994 --> 10:31.328
This guy's a dictator here. Yeah.

10:31.397 --> 10:32.497
Oh, Gloria, be rational.

10:32.564 --> 10:33.931
That's another Hitler over there.

10:33.999 --> 10:35.266
No, not a Hitler.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.968
Why not? Hitler didn't have
no kids, he had a police dog.

10:39.838 --> 10:43.207
Archie, I think we better go
upstairs and let them finish.

10:43.274 --> 10:47.077
No, no, no, no, no, we're in this
and we're gonna stay in this.

10:47.145 --> 10:50.914
You sit down. Arch, this
doesn't concern you.

10:50.982 --> 10:54.151
That kid that you don't wanna
have happens to be my grandson.

10:54.953 --> 10:56.654
Or granddaughter.

10:56.721 --> 10:58.322
Well, whatever.

10:58.389 --> 11:01.124
All right, Michael, you told me something,

11:01.192 --> 11:03.393
now I'm gonna tell you something.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.930
I haven't been taking the
pill for the last 6 weeks.

11:05.997 --> 11:07.798
Ah, jeez, private, private.

11:11.002 --> 11:12.169
Surprise.

11:14.205 --> 11:16.274
You wouldn't do that to me, would you?

11:16.341 --> 11:17.875
Wouldn't I?

11:17.943 --> 11:19.210
You would, you would.

11:19.277 --> 11:20.344
She would, she did.

11:20.412 --> 11:21.412
I didn't.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.650
I did not, and you know why I didn't?

11:25.717 --> 11:28.753
Because I wouldn't do a thing like
that without consulting you first.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.221
Because I'm honest.

11:30.288 --> 11:32.056
What--what are you saying I'm not?

11:32.124 --> 11:33.524
Well, if the shoe fits,

11:33.592 --> 11:35.193
kick yourself with it.

11:36.628 --> 11:39.563
Yeah, meathead. And if
the shoe don't fit you,

11:39.631 --> 11:43.400
give it to me and I'll kick you with it.

11:43.468 --> 11:46.370
Arch, will you butt out of this?
This is none of your business.

11:46.438 --> 11:47.805
The hell it ain't.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.775
You know, this family could
divorce you for holding back.

11:51.843 --> 11:54.745
A lot of people don't wanna have kids!

11:54.812 --> 11:58.850
Yeah, well, I know of one Polish couple
I wish would've thought that way.

12:08.927 --> 12:10.994
All right, all right, I'm sorry

12:11.062 --> 12:13.464
I apologize, I was wrong, ok?

12:13.532 --> 12:16.634
Ok, now, when do we have the baby?

12:16.735 --> 12:18.068
I wasn't wrong about that.

12:18.137 --> 12:20.371
I--I was just wrong not
to discuss it with you.

12:20.439 --> 12:23.141
Well, we're discussing it
now and you're still wrong.

12:23.208 --> 12:26.977
When we got married you promised
me 2 things, Michael stivic,

12:27.045 --> 12:28.946
a home and a family.

12:29.014 --> 12:32.316
Now I find out that you meant
my home and my family.

12:40.591 --> 12:42.293
Gloria, let--let's not change the subject.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.528
Can we stick to one fight
at a time, please?

12:44.595 --> 12:47.097
You know, Michael, you could've come to me.

12:47.165 --> 12:49.033
I--I'm really not that hard to find.

12:49.100 --> 12:53.337
Uh, when you get in this bed, I'm
the first girl on your left.

12:53.404 --> 12:56.573
You wanna talk about it
? Fine, we'll talk about it.

12:56.641 --> 12:59.043
Boy, you sure had me fooled.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.912
I can remember a week, about 4 years ago,

13:01.979 --> 13:03.981
when all you could do was cry.

13:04.048 --> 13:05.550
What are you talking about?

13:05.617 --> 13:07.918
When I had the miscarriage.

13:07.986 --> 13:09.987
You know what? You're a hypocrite.

13:10.055 --> 13:14.225
It's taken me 4 years to
find out you hate children.

13:14.292 --> 13:16.827
I don't hate children, Gloria.
I love children.

13:16.895 --> 13:19.797
That's why I don't wanna bring any
into the world the way it is now.

13:19.865 --> 13:21.999
Oh, come on. Stop playing Hamlet.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.201
And you stop being so damn naive, Gloria.

13:24.269 --> 13:26.670
Take a look around you, if you
can see through the pollution.

13:26.738 --> 13:28.539
You wanna take a kid to the beach nowadays?

13:28.607 --> 13:32.009
You don't give him a sand pail,
you give him a garbage pail.

13:32.077 --> 13:35.245
Ok, Mr. ecology. But all that can change.

13:35.313 --> 13:37.214
They're gonna clean up the air, too.
Oh, yeah?

13:37.282 --> 13:39.383
Oh, yeah? What about spray cans?

13:39.451 --> 13:41.419
What? Yeah, yeah.

13:41.486 --> 13:42.853
Here, right here.

13:43.555 --> 13:45.089
This is a killer.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.491
Oh, so now my hair spray's a killer?

13:47.558 --> 13:50.527
Yeah, your hair spray, my
deodorant, all spray cans.

13:50.595 --> 13:53.163
I read that there are gases
inside these cans, Gloria,

13:53.231 --> 13:56.167
that shoot up into the air
and can destroy the ozone.

13:56.234 --> 13:57.568
What's the ozone?

13:57.636 --> 14:00.203
Ozone is a protective shield
that surrounds the earth

14:00.271 --> 14:03.473
that protects us against ultraviolet rays.
You know what they can do?

14:03.542 --> 14:04.942
Yeah, they can give you a sunburn.

14:05.043 --> 14:07.277
Sure, when the ozone's there.
But when it's all gone

14:07.345 --> 14:10.781
you can get skin cancer, and God knows
what it can do to the plants and crops.

14:10.849 --> 14:11.882
[Thudding]

14:11.950 --> 14:13.551
Well, all right, Michael.

14:13.618 --> 14:14.652
[Sighs]

14:14.719 --> 14:17.521
Let's compromise.

14:17.589 --> 14:20.825
You let me have a baby and I'll
let you have my hair spray.

14:23.227 --> 14:25.663
You haven't heard one word I've said.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.165
Gloria, some scientists are
saying that in 10 years,

14:28.232 --> 14:32.269
at the rate the ozone's going, this
world is gonna be in big trouble.

14:32.337 --> 14:35.773
Well, Michael, you just can't
go on being afraid of life.

14:35.840 --> 14:39.509
I'm not afraid of life,
Gloria, I'm just facing it.

14:40.679 --> 14:41.878
[Sobs]

14:42.380 --> 14:43.414
Oh...

14:44.015 --> 14:45.215
[Sobbing]

14:46.217 --> 14:47.851
Don't cry.

14:47.919 --> 14:50.020
First, you tell me I can't have a family

14:50.087 --> 14:53.156
and now you say, "don't cry."
I'll cry if I want to.

14:53.825 --> 14:55.292
Gloria,

14:55.360 --> 14:57.628
I didn't say we couldn't have a family.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.663
We can always adopt.

14:59.731 --> 15:03.266
Hey, that way, we'd be giving our love
to a kid that's already been born.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.436
Well, maybe later.

15:05.503 --> 15:07.805
But first it's important to me, as a woman,

15:07.872 --> 15:10.073
to--to try to have one of my own.

15:10.141 --> 15:11.542
Why? Why?

15:11.609 --> 15:14.378
Why is that the most important
thing in life, t-t-to give birth?

15:14.446 --> 15:16.913
W-what're you, a baby machine?

15:16.981 --> 15:19.950
Some baby machine, I can't
even turn out one copy.

15:22.086 --> 15:23.520
Honey.

15:23.588 --> 15:26.357
Michael, don't you touch me
unless you mean business.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.066
Do you think, maybe, they made up?

15:36.133 --> 15:39.169
It's gotten awful quiet
up in their bedroom.

15:40.104 --> 15:41.505
Nah.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.608
If they made up, their bedroom'd
be anything but quiet.

15:48.447 --> 15:53.016
I wonder why Mike really
don't wanna have children.

15:53.084 --> 15:54.818
Edith, because he's an atheist.

15:54.886 --> 15:57.955
And the atheist religion
don't believe in the Bible.

15:58.023 --> 16:00.024
What's that got to do with it?

16:00.091 --> 16:02.526
It's got everything to do with
it, Edith, it's in the Bible,

16:02.594 --> 16:05.729
the lord gives normal
people a direct order.

16:05.830 --> 16:09.332
He says, "ye shall be
fruitful and multiply."

16:09.400 --> 16:12.670
And "ye" means everybody, right?

16:12.737 --> 16:15.739
That's right. Ye is the plurable of you.

16:24.282 --> 16:26.383
"And ye shall be

16:26.451 --> 16:28.985
fruitful and multiply."

16:29.053 --> 16:30.287
Oh, my.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.123
Don't God got a nice way of putting things?

16:36.360 --> 16:40.864
I wonder if he could do something
about me being a grandma.

16:40.932 --> 16:42.333
[Doorbell rings]

16:42.401 --> 16:44.468
I'll get it.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.603
"Be fruitful and multiply."

16:46.671 --> 16:48.072
And I'm stuck with a son-in-law

16:48.140 --> 16:50.040
who only wants to break even.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.244
Edith, I got your gas bill by mistake.

16:54.312 --> 16:56.580
Oh, thanks, Irene.

16:56.647 --> 16:58.949
Why didn't you pay it by mistake, Irene?

17:00.585 --> 17:02.520
Come on, admit it. I'm making sense.

17:02.587 --> 17:04.555
There's nothing to admit, Michael.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.625
I want a baby. So leave me alone.

17:07.692 --> 17:10.294
She wants a baby, leave her alone.

17:10.361 --> 17:12.563
She'll never get it that way, Archie.

17:14.332 --> 17:17.032
Irene, would you like to have some lunch?

17:17.101 --> 17:19.002
Oh, just coffee, thanks.

17:19.069 --> 17:22.005
Edith, am I interrupting anything here?

17:22.073 --> 17:25.642
Oh, no, it's already happened.

17:25.710 --> 17:27.511
Tell Irene the truth there, Edith.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.613
We just found out that the meat head
and Gloria ain't gonna have no kids

17:30.681 --> 17:32.682
and it's his fault.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.085
(Irene) Oh, I'm sorry, Mike.

17:35.152 --> 17:37.120
Was it the mumps you had last year?

17:39.157 --> 17:42.893
What mumps? I didn't have any mumps.
I had 2 wisdom teeth removed.

17:42.961 --> 17:44.561
That shouldn't do it.

17:46.364 --> 17:48.265
Well, with him you never know.

17:49.734 --> 17:52.136
Irene, I just don't wanna
have any kids, that's all.

17:52.204 --> 17:57.141
Mike says that the world ain't
a safe place for babies.

17:57.209 --> 17:59.376
It's not a safe place for adults.

17:59.444 --> 18:01.278
Yeah, see, see, Irene agrees with me.

18:01.346 --> 18:02.846
She knows what I'm talking about.

18:02.914 --> 18:06.149
E-even some catholics are using
the pill these days, right?

18:06.217 --> 18:09.086
I think they're using their
individual conscience.

18:09.154 --> 18:10.888
Yeah, well, a lot of them catholics

18:10.955 --> 18:14.191
are using their consciences
in secret, you know.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.526
Like, what do you call, under the covers?

18:19.330 --> 18:21.231
Have you thought about adoption, Mike?

18:21.299 --> 18:22.899
Sure, I'm all for it.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.135
Oh, what are you bringing up adoption for?

18:25.203 --> 18:28.272
Well, that way, they'd be taking
care of a child that's already here.

18:28.339 --> 18:31.775
Whatever they do, I'll be taking
care of the whole bunch of them.

18:33.778 --> 18:35.178
Look, Mike,

18:35.246 --> 18:37.247
Frank and I had the same doubts

18:37.315 --> 18:39.449
about bringing a child into this world.

18:39.517 --> 18:41.017
And then Frank said:

18:41.085 --> 18:43.887
"Who knows, maybe a child of
ours will change the world.

18:43.955 --> 18:46.590
Maybe we'll give birth to
another Abraham Lincoln."

18:46.657 --> 18:49.025
Jeez, you missed that
by a mile, didn't you?

18:50.528 --> 18:51.795
We came pretty close.

18:51.862 --> 18:54.131
One of them is tall, skinny, and poor.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.234
Goodbye, Archie. Ouch! Jeez,

18:57.301 --> 18:59.036
Irene. What did I do?

18:59.104 --> 19:00.904
You gave me a carpet shock.

19:04.909 --> 19:09.013
Mike, whatever you decide,
I love you both. Bye.

19:09.647 --> 19:11.515
Bye, Irene.

19:11.582 --> 19:12.616
[Door closing]

19:13.284 --> 19:17.120
Mike, I gotta confess.

19:17.188 --> 19:21.024
I was lookin' forward to being a grandma.

19:21.092 --> 19:23.627
We was both looking
forward to being grandma.

19:27.431 --> 19:30.701
Havin' a little grandson

19:30.768 --> 19:33.203
I could take to the park,

19:33.270 --> 19:34.771
or a granddaughter,

19:34.839 --> 19:36.507
whose hair I could curl

19:36.574 --> 19:39.676
and dress up in pretty clothes.

19:39.744 --> 19:41.678
And we could all be together

19:41.746 --> 19:43.981
on Thanksgiving and Christmas

19:44.048 --> 19:46.082
and say grace

19:46.150 --> 19:49.252
and laugh a lot and have fun.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.888
Where'd you get the idea that
that's how family life is?

19:51.956 --> 19:53.991
She's always watching <i>the waltons.</i>

19:58.229 --> 19:59.896
That's right.

20:00.731 --> 20:03.400
Look at all the kids they got.

20:03.468 --> 20:07.204
Oh, my, Mike, if the
waltons thought like you

20:07.272 --> 20:10.140
they wouldn't even have a TV show.

20:20.151 --> 20:21.818
Ma?

20:21.886 --> 20:24.154
You don't think I'm wrong, do you?

20:24.222 --> 20:27.691
I mean, I don't think it's that
selfish of me to want a baby.

20:27.758 --> 20:31.695
Oh, no, Gloria. You're a woman.

20:31.762 --> 20:34.531
Every woman wants a baby.

20:34.598 --> 20:37.334
It makes her feel useful.

20:37.401 --> 20:39.069
Is that the way I made you feel?

20:39.203 --> 20:42.472
Oh, sure. And I loved my little girl.

20:43.675 --> 20:45.442
But, ma,

20:45.510 --> 20:47.945
what is there to make you feel useful now?

20:48.013 --> 20:50.347
I'm not a little girl anymore.

20:50.414 --> 20:51.681
Well,

20:51.749 --> 20:53.484
I was looking forward

20:53.551 --> 20:57.454
to another 20 years with my grandchildren.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.856
I wouldn't count on it, if I was you, ma.

20:59.924 --> 21:03.193
Oh, Gloria, don't worry.

21:03.261 --> 21:05.162
Mike'll see it your way.

21:05.230 --> 21:07.631
Wait till you move into your own place,

21:07.698 --> 21:09.466
he'll change his mind.

21:09.534 --> 21:11.101
No, ma,

21:11.168 --> 21:14.237
Michael's got too many
strong arguments against it.

21:14.305 --> 21:17.674
Well, you got strong arguments for it.

21:17.742 --> 21:20.377
Oh, my goodness.

21:20.444 --> 21:24.447
What would you do with your
life if you didn't have a baby?

21:24.515 --> 21:25.982
I mean,

21:26.050 --> 21:30.119
that's the main thing
women was meant to do.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.759
The main thing? Yeah.

21:35.826 --> 21:38.362
You gotta admit, we was built for it.

21:41.031 --> 21:44.334
If we wasn't meant to have babies,

21:44.436 --> 21:46.136
we'd all be men.

21:48.472 --> 21:52.009
Excuse me, ma. Oh, yeah, sure.

21:52.076 --> 21:53.343
[Cutlery rattling]

21:55.646 --> 21:57.480
Michael? Yeah.

21:58.582 --> 22:00.250
Maybe you're right.

22:01.151 --> 22:03.520
Gloria?

22:03.588 --> 22:05.789
What--what made you change your mind?

22:06.391 --> 22:07.557
Ma did.

22:08.225 --> 22:09.793
How did I do that?

22:11.061 --> 22:12.362
Ma,

22:12.430 --> 22:16.666
I believe a--a woman's meant
to be a person first,

22:16.701 --> 22:19.636
and--and then maybe a mother.

22:19.703 --> 22:24.307
I don't need to give birth to a
baby to make me feel useful.

22:24.375 --> 22:27.410
I'm useful. I know you are.

22:28.613 --> 22:30.581
Gloria,

22:30.648 --> 22:33.550
does that mean you don't
want to have a baby?

22:33.618 --> 22:35.552
Oh, I didn't say that.

22:36.187 --> 22:38.555
I don't know, I...

22:38.623 --> 22:40.690
I just want to think about it.

22:43.894 --> 22:45.895
(Archie) How 'bout a beer out here?

22:48.732 --> 22:50.333
Excuse me.

22:55.206 --> 22:57.641
What the hell's going on out there?

22:58.376 --> 23:01.110
Well, they just made up.

23:01.112 --> 23:04.381
Is he gonna do his duty and
come up with the conjugals?

23:08.119 --> 23:10.387
Well, I don't know.

23:10.454 --> 23:14.091
I think Mike has got
Gloria thinking his way.

23:14.158 --> 23:17.894

23:45.289 --> 23:47.858
and the pills'll work
on the jeffersons' cat.
