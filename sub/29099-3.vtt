WEBVTT

00:10.923 --> 00:13.056
ALFRED:
Mr. Wayne.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.449
My card.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.190
Pennyworth Security.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.930
I'm trying to build
a nice business

00:17.974 --> 00:19.758
so I can settle down
and have kids.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.239
Suicide missions
are not part of the plan.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.327
Alfie...

00:23.371 --> 00:25.286
you have forgotten
who you are.

00:25.329 --> 00:28.332
You are S.A. fucking S.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.638
Hey, sit down, Spanish.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.076
PRIME MINISTER:
The No-Name League are fools

00:33.120 --> 00:35.035
who want to overthrow
the government

00:35.078 --> 00:36.166
and set up a socialist utopia.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.255
For the Raven Society,

00:38.299 --> 00:40.475
they're lunatics
who want to overthrow

00:40.518 --> 00:43.043
the government to set up
a fascist utopia.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.045
Who is the leader

00:45.088 --> 00:46.698
of the Raven Society?

00:46.742 --> 00:47.917
I'm the leader.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.876
Send Lord Harwood to...

00:50.920 --> 00:52.661
the barbers.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.532
They're to keep him alive.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.578
But break him.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.362
What does your father do?

00:58.406 --> 01:00.190
ESME:
He's a vicar
of Salisbury.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.844
Well, then why haven't
I met your old man yet?

01:01.887 --> 01:03.063
'Cause he's bloody tedious.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.194
Will you marry me?

01:04.238 --> 01:06.544
Yes. Yes, I will.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.420
What's happened to Bet Sykes?
We've had no word.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.639
AZIZ:
You don't need
to worry about her.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.250
ALFRED:
Well, Iam worried.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.252
AZIZ:
She's hanging under a hood

01:18.295 --> 01:19.688
for the Longbrass murder
next bank holiday.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.126
No!

01:54.331 --> 01:55.898
AZIZ:
Well...

01:55.941 --> 01:57.552
I'll be off.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.902
It was a pleasure
to meet you, my lord.

01:59.945 --> 02:02.209
You played a...

02:02.252 --> 02:04.776
thankless innings
with a damn straight bat,

02:04.820 --> 02:06.126
if I may say so.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.953
That's kind of you.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.781
Tell the prime minister

02:09.825 --> 02:12.044
I have seen
his last days coming.

02:12.088 --> 02:16.005
For every ounce of blood
I spill, he will pay

02:16.048 --> 02:17.485
tenfold.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.487
The nation will rise in my name,

02:19.530 --> 02:21.489
and he will die
in hellish torment.

02:21.532 --> 02:22.751
You tell him.

02:22.794 --> 02:25.667
Will-will you...
will you tell him that?

02:29.366 --> 02:31.020
You tell him!

02:34.502 --> 02:36.025
The country...

02:36.068 --> 02:38.593
will rise in my name!

03:01.964 --> 03:03.966
True what they say.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.534
You really can have
too much fun.

03:08.536 --> 03:09.928
My go, Alfie.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.408
I, uh...

03:11.452 --> 03:13.932
I'm fresh as a daisy.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.673
Shh, shh.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.762
Sounded like a jeep.

03:18.981 --> 03:21.244
Every bastard's got jeeps.

03:21.288 --> 03:25.640
SERGEANT MAJOR :
Fall in,
you useless fucking shower!

03:52.319 --> 03:54.799
Mr. Pennyworth,
Your Worship.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.237
Alfred.Sir.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.238
Thank you.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.676
I hope you don't mind
orange pekoe.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.765
Uh, no, sir.

04:06.855 --> 04:09.771
So, young man...
we meet at last.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.035
Well...

04:13.078 --> 04:15.603
I've gleaned one or two snippets
about you from my, uh, daughter,

04:15.646 --> 04:17.257
but you must tell me
about yourself, Alfred.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.129
Well, I'm-I'm 26.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.609
Born in Poplar.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.350
My father's a butler.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.917
Go on.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.833
I spent ten years in the army.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.052
Out East, mostly.

04:30.095 --> 04:31.662
Demobbed last year.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.186
I run my own
security business.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.189
You make no mention
of your emotional life.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.408
Church of England, sir.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.627
No funny business.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.106
I'm glad to hear it.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.326
I was thinking of Esme.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.024
I'm very much in love
with Esme, sir.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.113
That's why I'm here.

04:48.157 --> 04:50.420
To request your permission
to marry her.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.292
If she'll have me, sir.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.732
Ten years in the army, eh?

04:57.775 --> 05:00.169
Changes a man,
I should think.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.825
Hardens him.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.001
Brutalizes him.

05:08.003 --> 05:09.874
It cando that.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.137
But a man can keep changing,

05:12.181 --> 05:14.052
don't you think, sir?

05:14.096 --> 05:15.924
That's my plan, anyway.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.318
With Esme's support,
I hope.

05:18.361 --> 05:22.800
A woman's love is indeed the
great engine of our salvation.

05:22.844 --> 05:26.021
The mirror
of his grace.

05:26.064 --> 05:30.373
Tell me, Alfred, have you
fathered a child on my daughter?

05:30.417 --> 05:32.114
No, sir.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.594
Well, there's a blessing
at any rate.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.770
Esme is my
only child.

05:37.641 --> 05:41.210
So much like her dear mother.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.387
Such a graceful, luminous girl.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.954
A dancer.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.521
But...

05:47.564 --> 05:50.045
from a young age...

05:50.088 --> 05:54.223
she was always fascinated
by the dark side of life.

05:54.266 --> 05:57.182
Gruesome murders,
famous criminals,

05:57.226 --> 05:58.575
girls saved

05:58.619 --> 06:00.360
from brutal ravishment

06:00.403 --> 06:03.363
by strapping young heroes,
and so forth.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.194
The carnal vices possess her.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.982
She blames me, of course.

06:14.025 --> 06:17.115
And of course, I-I blame
myself, but, um....

06:17.159 --> 06:19.466
clergymen's daughters
are famously wayward.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.294
Uh, let me be
blunt, Alfred.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.949
I know my daughter's
proclivities.

06:24.993 --> 06:28.039
She likes the fact
that you've killed people.

06:28.083 --> 06:32.914
You satisfy her adolescent
revenge fantasies.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.612
If she loves you...

06:35.656 --> 06:37.788
she loves the animal in you.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.748
There is no...

06:40.791 --> 06:43.577
animal in me, sir.

06:43.620 --> 06:46.188
There's an animal in all of us.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.843
Don't you think?

06:48.886 --> 06:51.323
Esme is a young lady
of good family.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.891
You are the child of servants,

06:53.935 --> 06:55.719
without means
or education.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.199
That, young man,

06:57.242 --> 07:01.159
is no foundation
for a good Christian marriage.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.901
Only squalid misery can result

07:03.945 --> 07:06.121
from such a union.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.648
I will disinherit her.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.737
Do you understand?

07:16.958 --> 07:19.526
Thank you for your time.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.068
Good day to you, madam.

08:24.112 --> 08:26.027
You'll be Mrs. Spicer?

08:26.070 --> 08:27.507
I am.Be a love

08:27.550 --> 08:29.247
and tell Lulu I'm here.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.684
Lulu?

08:30.727 --> 08:32.729
There's no one here called Lulu.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.426
There is, you know.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.538
It didn't go well,

08:58.581 --> 09:00.496
I assume.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
I told you
it wouldn't.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.545
Why didn't you tell me
you were an heiress?

09:05.588 --> 09:07.721
I look after myself.

09:07.764 --> 09:09.636
He has money. So what?

09:12.203 --> 09:14.466
What did he say?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.817
He said I'm the child
of servants

09:16.860 --> 09:18.514
and you're a lady,

09:18.558 --> 09:21.430
and only sordid misery
can follow from such a union.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.432
Pompous bastard.
I knew it.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.913
Well, he's not wrong.
I amthe child of servants.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.044
Oh, do stop it.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.959
You know bloody well you're not.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.396
I-I mean... you are,

09:31.440 --> 09:33.355
but you're so much
more than that.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.531
Alfred, we don't
need his blessing.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.663
I'm not a child.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.403
He said he'll disinherit you.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.014
As if I care.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.668
I told him years ago to
stuff his bloody money.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.104
You should care.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.801
That's your future.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.237
You're my future.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.588
How can we get married?

09:48.631 --> 09:50.590
Wouldn't be right.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.243
Not without
your father's blessing.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.810
Fuck his blessing.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.552
You wanted to meet the
bastard, and now you have.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.207
I don't care what he says.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.209
Why do you care?

10:02.558 --> 10:04.691
He said what you love...

10:04.734 --> 10:07.607
is the animal in me.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.913
He said you like
that I've killed people

10:09.957 --> 10:12.524
because of your
revenge fantasies.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.745
Revenge, he said?

10:17.094 --> 10:19.053
Typical.

10:19.096 --> 10:22.360
He'sthe animal-- an animal
and a fucking coward.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.753
Steady on.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.537
That's your dad.

10:25.581 --> 10:28.889
What did he do wrong
to make you so angry?

10:30.325 --> 10:31.718
Nothing.

10:33.023 --> 10:36.679
Nothing. He did nothing wrong.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.769
And he's right, I do like it
that you've killed people.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.728
I suppose I thought
it was romantic,

10:41.771 --> 10:44.208
but it's all just rather
fucking squalid, isn't it?

10:44.252 --> 10:45.645
Ez.Fuck him,

10:45.688 --> 10:47.168
and fuck you!

11:24.814 --> 11:28.426
Not hatched yet, darling?

11:28.470 --> 11:30.385
You'll get there.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.741
Ian.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.438
You scared me.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.005
Sorry.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.051
You should have woke me.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.661
Well, you looked so peaceful.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.750
What time is it?

11:48.838 --> 11:50.448
Um...

11:50.492 --> 11:52.276
2:47.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.278
I've got to be
at home at 5:00

11:54.322 --> 11:55.715
for the vet.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.194
Time for tea and biscuits.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.413
No biscuits.

11:58.456 --> 12:01.633
You've arse biscuits.

12:01.677 --> 12:04.898
At ludicrous expense, I bought
some of the biscuits you prefer.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.900
You went to the shop?

12:06.943 --> 12:08.075
Had no tea.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.729
I could have gone for you.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.687
Nobody saw me.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.691
The grocer didn't see you?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.998
I assure you that everything...

12:20.174 --> 12:21.218
Whoa.

12:28.095 --> 12:32.577
3.1415926535.

12:32.621 --> 12:36.364
You did it, my darling.

12:36.407 --> 12:38.105
Ha-ha!

12:38.148 --> 12:40.455
She did it!Did what?

12:40.498 --> 12:43.327
Found pi to the tenth
decimal place-- by herself!

12:43.371 --> 12:45.416
Um, that's good, is it?

12:45.460 --> 12:48.680
This is the power
of-of flight, Sam.

12:48.724 --> 12:49.769
The-the human mind

12:49.812 --> 12:51.727
has wings!

12:51.771 --> 12:54.121
What's pie got
to do with it?

13:04.827 --> 13:06.742
MAN:
This is the police!

13:06.786 --> 13:07.917
Come on out!
We know you're in there!

13:07.961 --> 13:09.745
Come on! Open up!

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
We know where you are!
Open it now!

13:13.705 --> 13:16.056
Lady called about a job.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.579
I said you'd be here.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.146
Name?

13:19.189 --> 13:20.451
Well, she didn't say.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.976
You should ask for a name.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.891

14:15.811 --> 14:17.552
A drink?

14:17.595 --> 14:18.988
A cola, please.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.384
I saw your ad
in the paper.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.038
First time that's paid off.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.040
Usually business comes
by word of mouth.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.563
I'm new in town.

14:28.606 --> 14:29.956
I don't have many friends,

14:29.999 --> 14:31.696
or I'd have sought
a recommendation.

14:31.740 --> 14:34.482
I thought Pennyworth sounded
like a trustworthy name.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.223
How can I help you, Miss Kane?

14:36.266 --> 14:38.225
I need a driver bodyguard.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.879
One day, two days at most.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.532
We can do that.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.273
Let's say five pounds an hour?

14:43.317 --> 14:45.841
Plus expenses, of course.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.019
Five pounds an hour
is a lot of money.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.108

says ex-military.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.545
Yes, miss.
Myself and all the boys.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.807
Then I expect

14:55.851 --> 14:57.897
you're all calm, capable men

14:57.940 --> 14:59.637
who know the value
of discretion.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.030
And the price of ignorance.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.902
There'll be no
gunplay or violence.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.426
We'll be picking up a man
and taking him to an airport.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.907
Discretion is needed because
there's a warrant out

15:07.950 --> 15:10.126
for his arrest on charges
of homosexuality.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.911
The British government
is going to take this man

15:11.954 --> 15:14.522
to a room in a prison
and cut his balls off.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.045
Well, that's not cricket, is it?

15:17.177 --> 15:19.005
Who is he to you?

15:19.048 --> 15:22.051
Nobody. He has good friends.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.052
I'm working for them.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.575
Funny sort of job.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.925

15:25.968 --> 15:27.752

15:32.975 --> 15:34.237
I don't know the name.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.196
Hmm.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.852
Well, Miss Kane,
you have a driver.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.292
This is an advance.

Samuel Shay?

24:39.434 --> 24:41.305
What is that?

24:41.349 --> 24:44.439
The technical term is computer.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.050
It's a sort of
powerful calculator.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.878

24:48.922 --> 24:50.576
Looks like a bomb to me.

It does, doesn't it?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.406

27:21.509 --> 27:23.511
Don't push.

27:23.554 --> 27:26.209
I'm pushing,

27:26.253 --> 27:31.127
you sister-fucking,
Saxon piss drinker.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.738
Show me!

27:32.781 --> 27:34.609
Daveboy!Relax, Baz.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.176
Just amusing myself.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.091
This wee man here

27:38.134 --> 27:41.137
wouldn't shoot me

27:41.181 --> 27:43.705
if I was titty-fucking

27:43.749 --> 27:46.577
his weeping mother.

27:46.621 --> 27:50.059
Shh.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.807
What's your name?

28:00.026 --> 28:01.941
Phil.

28:04.030 --> 28:06.293
I'll call you Archie.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.773
Sit down.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.561
Pals, eh?

28:36.802 --> 28:39.587
Sorry.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.752
Who do you work for?

29:13.795 --> 29:15.754
I thought we agreed it's better
you don't know too much.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.582
Yeah, now I worry
I know too little.

29:18.626 --> 29:21.281
This is deep water.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.239
I work for the No-Name League.

29:24.632 --> 29:26.503
You're joking.Why would I make jokes?

29:26.547 --> 29:28.070
I thought, at worst, you're CIA.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.116
God, no.No? You have use

29:30.159 --> 29:32.553
of an old U.S. Air Force base
with a half-mile runway,

29:32.596 --> 29:34.555
lights on,
not a soul around.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.383
You have real
Chancery documents

29:36.426 --> 29:37.950
and far too much money,
and you're American.

29:37.993 --> 29:39.386
And you're not CIA?

29:39.429 --> 29:40.822
Sorry to disappoint you.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.824
The No-Names write pamphlets,
beat up coppers.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.434
Here's you doing
high-level espionage work

29:44.478 --> 29:46.219
for the Americans.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.437
Sounds a bit fishy,
doesn't it?

29:47.481 --> 29:49.004
I work for the No-Name League.

29:49.048 --> 29:51.877
If the leadership instructs me
to work with other entities,

29:51.920 --> 29:54.444
I work with other entities.Entities?

29:54.488 --> 29:56.403
I'm trying to save
a good man and his work

29:56.446 --> 29:58.274
from abuse and destruction.

29:58.318 --> 29:59.580
Isn't that enough?

30:21.254 --> 30:23.822
SWOPE:
Transformers!

30:42.623 --> 30:44.494
SWOPE:
You, in there!

30:48.237 --> 30:50.196
Come out.

30:50.239 --> 30:52.154
Let's have a chat.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.506
Who are these lot?

30:56.550 --> 30:58.465
Raven Society, I'm afraid.

30:58.508 --> 30:59.901
Of course.

30:59.945 --> 31:02.730
Oh, God. You-you-you
can't let them take her.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.777
We won't.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.779
Alfred,

31:08.823 --> 31:10.520
what's our best move here?

31:10.564 --> 31:12.609
Surrender.We can't do that.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.785
They'll take him
and the computer.

31:14.829 --> 31:16.787
Nobody dies.
That's a good result.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.877
Thurso and his work
are far too precious

31:18.920 --> 31:21.053
to let fall into the hands
of evil people.

31:21.096 --> 31:23.316
And those are evil people.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.100
They can't have him.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.668
They can. They have guns.

31:27.711 --> 31:28.843
So do I.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.891
They can't have him.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.677
And you're willing to die
to stop that happening?

31:40.942 --> 31:42.901
I'll have a chat to 'em.

31:52.562 --> 31:55.783
Jesus.

31:55.826 --> 31:58.655
A pair of cheery fuckers,
us, eh?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.484
Let's get some music on.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.008
There's a radio.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.097
Fuck the ras-hole radio.

32:06.185 --> 32:08.100
I said I'm sorry.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.536
For fuck's sake.

32:09.579 --> 32:11.407
I tired, Daveboy.

32:11.451 --> 32:13.279
You're exhausting me.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.455
It was an accident.It's you, brother.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.544
You'rethe accident.Now, fuck off.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.676
You need help
with the drinking.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.940
I can drink fine on my own.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.726
I trying to talk to you.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.076
You can't be serious
for one moment?

32:31.993 --> 32:35.605
You wee, cowering,
timorous bastard.

32:35.649 --> 32:38.173
Look what you did.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.961
There he is.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.963
Which one?

32:45.006 --> 32:46.921
You see me smiling?

32:49.532 --> 32:51.317
We're even now, yeah?

32:53.797 --> 32:55.756
Mr. MacDougal, a word!

33:01.414 --> 33:04.983
The... Durex machine,

33:05.026 --> 33:06.985
Mr. MacDougal,

33:07.028 --> 33:09.988
is not your personal pig bank.

33:10.031 --> 33:12.512
Agreed.

33:17.734 --> 33:20.302
Got him.
Oh.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.522
Oh, that was close, eh?

33:24.350 --> 33:26.178
"The Durex machine,
Mr. MacDougal,

33:26.221 --> 33:28.615
is not your personal pig bank."

33:30.008 --> 33:32.140
Daveboy, look at me!

33:32.184 --> 33:34.142
If you want to die...

33:34.186 --> 33:36.492
...do it quickly

33:36.536 --> 33:38.668
and don't make
your friends...

33:38.712 --> 33:40.496
watch.

33:49.723 --> 33:52.247
I don't want to die.

33:54.162 --> 33:56.164
I'm just trying
to pass the fucking time.

33:57.470 --> 33:59.385
You know?

34:03.171 --> 34:05.565
I'm trying to pass the time.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.048
What's wrong, brother?

34:55.789 --> 34:57.704
You can't walk?

35:04.537 --> 35:07.061
Hey.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.019
Okay.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.332
Evening.

35:18.464 --> 35:21.206
SWOPE:
Parky, isn't it?

35:21.249 --> 35:23.773
You've a Mr. Ian Thurso
in there?

35:23.817 --> 35:26.211
Bring him
and his belongings out here.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.082
We'll see
he's well looked after.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.605
Looked after?

35:29.649 --> 35:31.129
You'll kill him.

35:31.172 --> 35:33.131
His machine's useless
without him.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.871
We won't hurt him.

35:34.915 --> 35:37.265
Honestly, mate.
It's more than my job's worth.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.354
Not up to me, love.

35:39.398 --> 35:42.183
Give us a moment,
and I'll talk to my employer.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.187
MARTHA:
Well?

35:46.231 --> 35:48.320
A right old pickle.

35:48.363 --> 35:49.886
Suppose--

35:49.930 --> 35:51.758
just suppose--
I was to sort it out.

35:51.801 --> 35:53.238
Yes?

35:53.281 --> 35:55.936
What would that be worth
to whoever pays your bills?

35:55.979 --> 35:57.198
Name a price.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.679
10,000 quid.Done.

35:59.722 --> 36:02.986
Fuck. This isdeep water.

36:03.030 --> 36:04.292
10,000 pounds? Seriously?

36:04.336 --> 36:05.685
What's the plan?

36:07.252 --> 36:09.167
Give me that gun.

36:17.871 --> 36:20.003
I talked to my boss.
She said no.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.962
No?

36:22.005 --> 36:24.094
These No-Names are
loony bastards, aren't they?

36:24.138 --> 36:25.444
She's under strict instructions

36:25.487 --> 36:27.228
to kill him
and destroy his machine

36:27.272 --> 36:29.709
rather than let 'em fall
into your hands.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.711
What?She says it's your choice.

36:31.754 --> 36:35.802
Go away, or I kill him,
and she smashes his machine.

36:35.845 --> 36:37.543
She's in there with a hammer.

36:37.586 --> 36:40.676
So, if you don't fuck off,
I'm gonna kill him as ordered.

36:42.243 --> 36:44.811
Smartass bastard.

36:44.854 --> 36:47.379
Look, the plane's not landing,

36:47.422 --> 36:48.815
so Thurso can't
leave the country.

36:48.858 --> 36:51.600
You chaps can try again
tomorrow.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.254
Can't you?
There's hope.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.865
Long as he's
alive, of course.

36:55.909 --> 37:00.087
Dead, he's just a sad story
to tell the boss.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.610
And I know what that's like.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.919
Can't hang about
all night.

37:05.962 --> 37:08.356
Please.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.629
I'm-I'm... I'm fibrillating.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.109
You're all right.
Drink some water.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.371
They've really gone?

37:23.415 --> 37:24.720
No.

37:24.764 --> 37:26.156
They'll be waiting
to ambush our car

37:26.200 --> 37:27.854
a couple of miles down the road.

37:27.897 --> 37:29.421
So, then, how are we supposed
to get the...?Follow me.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.223
Count to 15 slowly.

37:50.703 --> 37:52.270
One.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.097
Two, three.

37:59.929 --> 38:05.283
11, 12, 13, 14.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.241
15.

40:43.789 --> 40:46.574
I'm coming with you!

41:16.386 --> 41:18.388
Thank you.

41:18.432 --> 41:20.390
Thank you.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.523
Perhaps you'll consider
working with me again?

41:22.567 --> 41:24.656
If you'll name an
acceptable price.

41:24.699 --> 41:26.658
You need not carry a gun.

41:26.701 --> 41:28.486
Just driving.

41:28.529 --> 41:30.139
That's what you said
about this job.

41:30.183 --> 41:31.619
Shit happens.

41:31.663 --> 41:33.534
That's why the pay is good.

41:33.578 --> 41:36.189
I respect your courage
and commitment, Miss Kane,

41:36.232 --> 41:39.540
but I think you work
for some very dodgy people.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.629
On the other hand,

41:41.673 --> 41:45.111
money is money, and I need some.

41:45.154 --> 41:47.287
I'll work for you.

41:47.330 --> 41:49.245
Driving.

41:49.289 --> 41:51.509
I won't carry a gun,
and you'll be honest with me.

41:51.552 --> 41:54.468
Implying I've lied to you,
which I haven't,

41:54.512 --> 41:56.470
but I take your point.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.472
No gun required.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.343
No dishonesty.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.521
I'll need you next week
if you're available.

42:04.826 --> 42:07.002
I am.

42:07.046 --> 42:09.178
You're a strange sort of soldier

42:09.222 --> 42:11.703
who doesn't like
guns and violence.

42:11.746 --> 42:14.836
You probably haven't
met many soldiers.

42:15.924 --> 42:18.579
My father was a soldier.

42:18.623 --> 42:21.321
Did he tell you
about his nightmares?

42:21.364 --> 42:23.062
He said he slept like a baby.

42:23.105 --> 42:25.107
He was lying to you.

42:48.870 --> 42:50.785
A little bother,
but nobody died.

42:52.004 --> 42:54.702
Hmm... What's the bad news?

42:54.746 --> 42:57.183
Yeah, fair play, there is
some bad news comes with.

42:59.054 --> 43:00.708
Hey, don't look
at me like that, Baz.

43:03.276 --> 43:07.410
She's a No-Name
or a CIA spook or both.

43:07.454 --> 43:09.325
I'm not sure.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.979
A dark path.

But so be it.

How was your day, anyway?

43:24.210 --> 43:26.212

Very ordinary.

Stuck pigs are laughing.

Yes, ma'am.

44:27.926 --> 44:30.668
There's no one looking
for us.

44:30.711 --> 44:33.540
Been near on a month
and nowt in papers.

You can go home.

44:41.853 --> 44:43.898
I'll be off back down
to London.

44:43.942 --> 44:46.640
Why? You've had nowt but trouble
since you went down there.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.729
There were good times.
I made friends.

Like who? Like whom?
Them daft Raven people?

You abducted her
and you locked her up,

you daft bitch,
she's terrified of you.

45:07.792 --> 45:10.098
You wouldn't know.

45:10.142 --> 45:11.709
You weren't there.

45:11.752 --> 45:13.667
I have to see her again.

45:15.147 --> 45:16.714
She thinks you're dead.

45:16.757 --> 45:19.978
That's romantic, isn't it?

45:20.021 --> 45:21.588
Coming back to life.

45:25.592 --> 45:28.813
With me new look and everything.

45:28.856 --> 45:30.771
You're coming back home with me

45:30.815 --> 45:32.860
if I have to lash you
to the roof rack.

45:40.825 --> 45:44.567
SERGEANT MAJOR:
Fall in,
you useless fucking shower!

45:44.611 --> 45:47.396
DAVEBOY:
That's our boys!

45:49.485 --> 45:51.836
I don't envy the Hun right now.

45:51.879 --> 45:55.622
Never seen such a...
villainous crew.

45:55.665 --> 45:59.017
In an hour or so, it's going
to get rather warm 'round here.

45:59.060 --> 46:02.890
So let's show these blighters
that we can take the heat

46:02.934 --> 46:06.024
and give it back to 'em...
hotter.

46:07.939 --> 46:09.244
We hold this position,
come what may.

46:10.637 --> 46:12.073
I say!

46:12.117 --> 46:13.335
Fuck me.

46:14.467 --> 46:16.817
Steady on, Doris.

46:22.649 --> 46:24.738
We're on your side.

46:31.571 --> 46:33.051
SOLDIER:
Get you steady, Bazza.

46:33.094 --> 46:35.836
Here you go.

46:35.880 --> 46:39.840
♪ A lonely mystery

46:43.235 --> 46:45.498
♪ When you...

46:53.767 --> 46:55.551
Don't he look smart, Mr. P?

46:55.595 --> 46:57.118
You look like a hairdresser.

46:57.162 --> 46:59.294
Oh.MR. PENNYWORTH:
Money in your pocket,

46:59.338 --> 47:00.948
and you do what any
common spiv would do.

47:00.992 --> 47:03.255
Waste it on flash clobber
and sports cars.

47:03.298 --> 47:04.778
ALFRED:
The car's on tick.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.432
Ten pound a week.

47:20.881 --> 47:25.320
Don't think I don't give you
credit for your progress.

47:25.364 --> 47:26.408
I do.

47:26.452 --> 47:28.410
Thank you.

47:28.454 --> 47:30.412
Here.

47:30.456 --> 47:31.892
I do worry, though.

47:31.936 --> 47:34.199
Well, you don't need to.No, I worry that,

47:34.242 --> 47:35.722
now you're doing well enough,

47:35.765 --> 47:36.897
you'll be thinking you're
good enough for Esme.

47:39.726 --> 47:41.032
Never occurred to me.

47:41.075 --> 47:42.555
Good.

47:42.598 --> 47:45.601
Yeah, that would be a mistake.

47:45.645 --> 47:47.125
I'm telling you,

47:47.168 --> 47:50.084
you're well shot of her.

47:50.128 --> 47:53.479
Is that right?

47:53.522 --> 47:55.394
Mark my words, son:
East is East,

47:55.437 --> 47:56.961
and West is West,
and ne'er the twain.

47:57.004 --> 47:58.353
Oh, give it a rest.

47:58.397 --> 47:59.354
Excuse me?

47:59.398 --> 48:00.616
It was you who got shot of her.

48:02.357 --> 48:04.185
How'd you make that out?

48:04.229 --> 48:07.232
You with your anger
and your bitterness.

48:07.275 --> 48:09.016
You scared the life out of her.

48:09.060 --> 48:10.452
And you did it on purpose,
didn't you?

48:10.496 --> 48:12.846
I don't know what you mean.

48:14.761 --> 48:17.677
Now what?

48:17.720 --> 48:18.896
I've had enough of him.

48:18.939 --> 48:20.332
"Never the twain"
my arse.

48:20.375 --> 48:21.637
Be careful now.

48:21.681 --> 48:23.378
Or what?
MARY:
Shh.

48:23.422 --> 48:25.076
Who wants a sandwich?

48:25.119 --> 48:28.427
See how he behaves, eh?

48:28.470 --> 48:30.777
Hasn't changed.

48:30.820 --> 48:33.954
Still a belligerent little thug
that doesn't know what's what.

48:33.998 --> 48:35.477
What is what?
Why don't you show me, Dad.

48:35.521 --> 48:37.175
You need showing.Well, show me, then.

48:37.218 --> 48:38.306
MARY:
Shh.

48:38.350 --> 48:40.743
Just leave him be, Alfie.

48:40.787 --> 48:43.094
No, no, let him carry on.

48:43.137 --> 48:47.141
Let him disrespect his father
in his own house. I can take it.

48:47.185 --> 48:49.100
There's only ever been
two people disrespected

48:49.143 --> 48:51.058
in this house, and you
ain't one of them,

48:51.102 --> 48:52.103
are you, Dad?
Be honest.

48:52.146 --> 48:53.931
You were a troublemaker.

48:53.974 --> 48:55.584
You needed discipline.

48:55.628 --> 48:57.238
Mum need discipline,
too, did she?

48:57.282 --> 48:59.980
Making trouble,
was she?

49:01.982 --> 49:04.942
Alfie, leave off.

49:04.985 --> 49:07.118
It's between me
and your father.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.034
Least said,
soonest mended.

49:10.077 --> 49:11.774
That's what you always say.

49:11.818 --> 49:13.776
It's what I believe.

49:15.256 --> 49:16.692
MR. PENNYWORTH:
Carry on, son.

49:16.736 --> 49:19.391
You're a big man now.

49:19.434 --> 49:21.219
Raise your voice.

49:21.262 --> 49:22.872
Chastise your own father.

49:22.916 --> 49:25.049
All right.

49:25.092 --> 49:28.269
It's all right, Mum.

49:28.313 --> 49:30.532
You're not wrong.

49:30.576 --> 49:32.534
Least said.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.061
Sorry, Dad.

49:37.104 --> 49:40.020
I should hope you are.

49:45.983 --> 49:48.028
Esme.

49:48.072 --> 49:49.987
Alfie, what are you doing here?

49:50.030 --> 49:52.119
Come for a bus ride with me.

49:52.163 --> 49:54.904
A bus ride? Why?

49:54.948 --> 49:56.558
Well, I had a car,
but I got rid.

49:56.602 --> 49:58.082
Don't need a car
in London, do you?

49:58.125 --> 50:00.954
I mean, where would we be going
on this bus ride?

50:00.998 --> 50:03.043
Well, you trust me, don't you?

50:03.087 --> 50:05.872
No.

50:05.915 --> 50:07.091
Not really.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.753
Upstairs.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.157
What do you think?

50:30.201 --> 50:32.812
What do I think of what?

50:32.855 --> 50:35.858
The roses and the
chocolates are for you.

50:35.902 --> 50:39.384
Um, thank you?

50:39.427 --> 50:41.125
Alfie, what is this?

50:41.168 --> 50:43.083
I rented the place.

50:43.127 --> 50:45.738
Two years up front.

50:45.781 --> 50:47.305
It's yours.

50:47.348 --> 50:50.525
Course, if you wanted me
to live here, too,

50:50.569 --> 50:52.092
I could be persuaded.

50:52.136 --> 50:54.442
Alfie, this is mad.

50:54.486 --> 50:56.444
We're not a couple.

50:56.488 --> 50:58.533
You left me, remember?

50:58.577 --> 51:01.058
No, you left me.

51:01.101 --> 51:03.799
I was there. You gave me
the ring back and you left.

51:03.843 --> 51:07.064
You didn't try to stop me
from going.

51:09.631 --> 51:11.590
I got scared.

51:11.633 --> 51:13.983
You, scared?

51:16.377 --> 51:19.641
All this talk of animals.

51:21.861 --> 51:24.820
I do have an animal in me.

51:24.864 --> 51:26.126
He's fed me,

51:26.170 --> 51:28.650
paid the rent,
kept me alive since I was 16.

51:28.694 --> 51:32.393
And I don't know if there's
anybody else in there.

51:32.437 --> 51:36.223
Somebody more peaceful.

51:36.267 --> 51:39.139
Somebody that deserves you.

51:42.751 --> 51:44.579
Anyway, I've decided
not to worry anymore.

51:44.623 --> 51:47.234
It's a waste
of time, so...

51:47.278 --> 51:49.715
So, you robbed a bank.

51:49.758 --> 51:52.674
Business has been good,
but that's not the point.

51:52.718 --> 51:54.720
Well, no, that sort of is
my point, actually.

51:54.763 --> 51:58.289
Uh, sorry, you're distracting
me. What's my point?

51:58.332 --> 52:00.856
Why are we here, Alfie?

52:02.641 --> 52:05.426
You had the courage to go
your own way and trust yourself.

52:06.906 --> 52:08.603
I didn't.

52:08.647 --> 52:12.129
But I do now.

52:12.172 --> 52:14.870
If you'll have me.
