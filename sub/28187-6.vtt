00:04.130 --> 00:07.467
Ifrit, Grimnir needs
you at the Corn Palace.

00:07.634 --> 00:09.302
Ask for Old Iktomi.

00:09.469 --> 00:11.012
- To what end?
- Gungnir.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.722
You're getting Fire-eyes
and the fairy

00:12.889 --> 00:14.474
to fetch
your fucking spear for ya?

00:14.641 --> 00:16.559
I didn't picture
the Corn Palace like this.

00:16.726 --> 00:19.020
In my head, it was a lot
more yellow. Like corn.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.314
Roadside attractions
are all about the green.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.443
This is an instrument of death.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.529
That, my very old friend,

00:27.696 --> 00:30.240
is not your
motherfucking concern.

00:34.411 --> 00:35.870
My spear?

00:36.037 --> 00:37.580
Okay, gentlemen,

00:37.747 --> 00:39.374
the King of the Dwarves
awaits us!

00:39.541 --> 00:42.085
Alviss, son of Vindalf.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.005
The wondrous Gungnir.

00:46.172 --> 00:48.800
The runes require
attention, Alfather.

00:48.967 --> 00:52.387
And rune carving is
Dvalin's domain.

00:53.763 --> 00:56.182

scourge of Ragnarok!
Donar the Great!

04:57.173 --> 05:00.551
She sings, she dances,
but don't be fooled, guys,

05:00.718 --> 05:03.262
she can shoot the balls
off a flea at 50 yards.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.306
Miss Columbia!

05:11.479 --> 05:14.399
So, listen,
stick around, sample it all.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.693
There's something here

06:07.160 --> 06:09.579
Oh. Thank you so much. Yeah.

06:09.746 --> 06:11.039
Mr. Grimnir!

06:23.760 --> 06:25.678
Bottle of our finest bubbly

06:25.845 --> 06:29.474
for Table number 3 over there.
On the house.

06:44.697 --> 06:46.074
Fill 'er up.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.877
Hey.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.255
Hey!

07:02.590 --> 07:04.008
There she is.

07:05.093 --> 07:06.594
You sleep okay?

07:07.637 --> 07:09.806
Hardly the Odinsleep, but...

07:10.723 --> 07:12.767
it'll do for the task ahead.

07:12.934 --> 07:15.394
Mm. Thought you might've
been dead.

07:16.646 --> 07:19.690
Playing dead convincingly
is an underrated skill.

07:20.525 --> 07:23.486
Would you get my guitar
out of the trunk, partner?

07:28.366 --> 07:32.036
This day turns to shit...
I'm outta here.

07:32.203 --> 07:34.539
Would you lower your bark,
Mr. Moon?

07:34.705 --> 07:36.582
This is a respectable
neighborhood.

07:36.749 --> 07:38.543
I thought we were
looking for dwarves.

07:38.709 --> 07:42.463
We are. Someone built a mall
over their center of power

07:42.630 --> 07:46.968
so they do what they have to
to get by. In this case, retail.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.277
This used to be Gomorrah.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.195
Hordes of teeny-boppers,

08:06.362 --> 08:09.323
their insatiable desire
for retail urges

08:09.490 --> 08:12.243
stoked by every swipe
of their daddy's credit card.

08:12.410 --> 08:14.078
And now? Oh!

08:14.245 --> 08:16.497
Dies irm, dies illa,

08:16.664 --> 08:18.916
Solvet saeclum in favilla,

08:19.083 --> 08:21.544
Teste David cum Sibylla. Huh?

08:21.711 --> 08:24.088
To dead malls everywhere:

08:24.255 --> 08:27.758
may you rot in the detritus
of your own cupidity!

08:27.925 --> 08:29.719
Lower your bark,
Wednesday.

08:29.886 --> 08:31.429
It's a respectable
neighborhood.

08:34.599 --> 08:37.059
Sometimes you
remind me of my son.

08:41.314 --> 08:42.523
Your son?

08:45.109 --> 08:46.235
Yeah.

08:47.862 --> 08:51.032
Come on. Let's go find
Sindri and Dvalin.

08:54.327 --> 08:55.912
The war begins

08:57.246 --> 08:59.123
and nobody sees it.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.919
The storm lowers

09:04.879 --> 09:06.672
and nobody knows it.

09:08.674 --> 09:11.677
A truck driver,
in Denver,

09:11.844 --> 09:17.266
killed by a rubber-gripped
claw-headed hammer

09:18.476 --> 09:19.852
in his home.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.024
A community of nine anchorites

09:25.191 --> 09:28.945
dead from carbon monoxide
poisoning.

09:30.404 --> 09:36.244
A lobster tank smashed in
an Atlanta seafood restaurant.

09:36.410 --> 09:40.998
Single attacks
may light the spark.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.170
But...

09:48.381 --> 09:52.510
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

10:03.938 --> 10:05.564
S'up?

10:05.731 --> 10:07.441
Victory...

10:08.442 --> 10:12.363
...requires a power

10:13.239 --> 10:17.326
of breadth and scope.

10:18.786 --> 10:24.292
Your worshippers harness
their power.

10:26.210 --> 10:30.673
Oh, yeah, totally.
I can up my game.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.258
Check this out.

11:03.998 --> 11:06.125
Double up on that
nipple tape, Ecdysiasts.

11:06.292 --> 11:08.294
Nobody coming here
to see your areolas.

11:08.461 --> 11:12.506
It's Donar's moose knocker that
brings all the boys to the yard.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.055
Whose shoes are these?

11:21.098 --> 11:25.186
Whose fucking shoes are these?

11:26.312 --> 11:28.105
I don't work for you crackers!

11:28.272 --> 11:31.400
I'm not the hired help
around this bitch!

11:31.567 --> 11:36.947
Somebody is goin' to break
their skinny stripper neck

11:37.114 --> 11:41.786
on account of those
motherfucking shoes!

11:44.914 --> 11:46.457
Got my pressure up.

11:55.674 --> 12:00.346
My queen? The nature
of our arrangement is such

12:00.513 --> 12:04.934
that I get 20 percent
of your worship.

12:05.101 --> 12:10.064
I should be smiling with
a hard-on but, alas,

12:10.231 --> 12:12.358
I am not.

12:12.525 --> 12:15.528
Get yo' face out the mirror.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.614
Get your ass on the stage!

12:18.781 --> 12:20.991
I'm gonna count to seven

12:21.742 --> 12:23.661
and I'm startin' at four!

12:36.298 --> 12:37.633
Here, let me.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.978
Do not arouse me, Columbia.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.355
If my sword were
to get aloft on stage...

12:51.522 --> 12:53.441
We'll get raided again,
the club will close down,

12:53.607 --> 12:56.652
we can go to California,
land of opportunity!

12:56.819 --> 13:00.239
I know you desire to leave
Chicago, but I need more time.

13:00.656 --> 13:03.742
I can't abandon Grimnir,
not now. He needs me.

13:03.909 --> 13:06.954
What he needs is a pony
for his dog-and-pony show,

13:07.121 --> 13:09.039
and that's you, mister.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.709
We do the same tired song
and dance night after night,

13:11.876 --> 13:14.336
feeding off of cheap applause
of drunken punters.

13:15.421 --> 13:17.214
But out west, we'd be free.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.635
Come on, Donnie.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.430
Don't you wanna get out of
this two-bit peeler palace?

13:25.681 --> 13:28.225
Who knows if I'd even survive
in California?

13:28.392 --> 13:30.311
The frontier
isn't exactly rife

13:30.478 --> 13:33.063
with Hessians and Vikings
to pay my tribute.

13:33.439 --> 13:36.233
You're ridin' with
Manifest Destiny, baby.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.152
I am the West.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.613
I won't let anything
happen to you.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.203
I have a contract
with Grimnir.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.288
So do you.

13:49.455 --> 13:52.833
It's been 10 years, Donar.
It's time to move on.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.505
Together.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.053
Good evening, young sir.

14:04.220 --> 14:07.056
Well, if it isn't
the top banana.

14:07.223 --> 14:10.100
Ladies, make this gentleman
comfortable. Go on.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.645
Snuggle up!
Grimnir's the name. Al Grimnir.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.730
Owner of this fine
establishment.

14:14.897 --> 14:20.861
Fine? Listen, pops,
I've seen fine and this...

14:21.028 --> 14:23.280
...ain't it.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.449
You're a man of discriminating
taste? Well, girls,

14:25.616 --> 14:28.035
you're just gonna have to
convince him otherwise.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.162
This is Isamba

14:30.329 --> 14:32.915
and her enchanting sister,
Gfjun,

14:33.082 --> 14:35.668
two of our most gifted
showgirls.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.504
I dunno, George.

14:39.255 --> 14:41.757
- It's Al.
- Well, Al,

14:41.924 --> 14:44.009
your bubbly's flat,
your cherries are stale,

14:44.176 --> 14:47.304
and your girls...
are cheaper than your suit.

14:48.847 --> 14:52.101
Oh!

14:52.268 --> 14:54.270
I was just leaving.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.151
Oh, no, no, no.
You can't leave, not just yet.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.778
You're gonna miss our best act.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.655
Besides, you might know us
by our other name.

15:04.822 --> 15:06.907
We are the Ancient Ones.

15:08.367 --> 15:12.162
The ones that paved the way
so you kids could do your thing.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.211
That's for you.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.100
Yeah...

15:34.226 --> 15:36.228
Great. Mm-hmm.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.148
I am.

15:40.608 --> 15:42.818
Look, it's as good as done.
No need...

15:45.404 --> 15:48.782
Yeah, I won't. Ciao.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.577
You're still here.

15:51.744 --> 15:53.829
You guys, you've got
your fingers on the pulse

15:53.996 --> 15:56.707
but what happens when people
find a new way to communicate,

15:56.874 --> 16:00.294
huh, and this thing
becomes obsolete?

16:00.461 --> 16:02.254
No way, gramps.

16:03.547 --> 16:06.133
- Ma Bell is here to stay.
- Oh, I admire your confidence.

16:06.300 --> 16:09.136
But when - and I mean "when" -

16:10.012 --> 16:13.307
a new shiny thing comes along
and these wires

16:13.474 --> 16:17.311
and dials and Bakelite
all hit the skids,

16:17.478 --> 16:19.688
you are gonna need some

16:19.855 --> 16:24.026
real power on your side.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.030
Time to go to work.

16:29.657 --> 16:32.284
Ladies and gentlemen!

16:33.202 --> 16:35.871
Joey Alameda
and the Hot Box Seven!

16:36.038 --> 16:39.792
The band, huh? Come on, guys,
take a bow. The band.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.877
Okay, that's enough. We wouldn't
want to get them too excited.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.962
They'll want more money.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.424
Our next performer, he's sharp
as a tack, strong as an ox,

16:47.591 --> 16:49.510
and a big hit

16:49.677 --> 16:52.596
not just with the ladies
in our audience, I hear, huh?

16:52.763 --> 16:55.015
So!

16:55.182 --> 16:56.975
Putting the scandal
in Scandinavia

16:57.142 --> 16:58.852
since time immemorial,

16:59.019 --> 17:01.313
let's give a big hand
for my boy!

17:01.480 --> 17:04.191
Donar the Great!

17:34.847 --> 17:37.015
So...

18:07.463 --> 18:09.548
Whoo!

18:20.350 --> 18:22.644
Excuse me, sir,
are you the manager?

18:22.811 --> 18:24.730
Why, you wanna buy a club?

18:24.897 --> 18:26.815
No. My colleagues and I

18:26.982 --> 18:29.234
would like to have a word
with you about your strongman.

18:29.401 --> 18:32.946
Oh, well, tell me, wh-why do
you wear the flanged thwarts?

18:33.113 --> 18:35.032
Sorry?

18:35.199 --> 18:38.452
The angle cross of fylfot.
The rune on Gunnvaldr's stone.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.621
Oh, my armband?

18:40.788 --> 18:42.915
It's the symbol
of our organization.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.792
The Friends of New Germany.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.796
Oh, right.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.881
I wasn't aware she'd landed
on our shores.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.636
The name's Manfred.
May I buy you a drink?

18:56.970 --> 18:58.096
Yeah.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.682
Why not?

19:07.898 --> 19:11.193
I'm sorry, Alfather,
but you're wasting your time.

19:11.902 --> 19:14.321
I ought to throttle Alviss
for sending you here.

19:14.488 --> 19:17.825
He knows Dvalin isn't capable
of what you ask.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.160
I never expected
to hear such defeat

19:20.327 --> 19:22.246
in the voice of the one
they call...

19:22.412 --> 19:24.915
...Spark-Sprayer.

19:25.082 --> 19:27.543
I fear my giant of a brother

19:27.709 --> 19:31.505
has sent you here
to humiliate me, my lord.

19:31.672 --> 19:35.592
What was broken can
and must be repaired,

19:35.759 --> 19:39.346
my dwarfish friend,
for the sake of the future.

19:41.056 --> 19:44.476
What say you, Son of Ymir?
Wanna etch my runes?

19:44.893 --> 19:47.729
Alviss didn't tell you
everything, I see.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.815
What's wrong with him?

19:49.982 --> 19:51.441
Same damn thing

19:51.608 --> 19:53.443
that's wrong with
the rest of our kind:

19:54.403 --> 19:57.030
he's meeting his fate
sooner than most.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.199
He's working now. Why doesn't
he just etch the spear?

19:59.366 --> 20:02.411
Oh, Sindri, this is
my associate, Shadow.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.998
Shadow, you say?

20:09.585 --> 20:12.212
I'm afraid it's not
that simple, my lord.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.340
The strength to etch
runes of war

20:15.507 --> 20:18.510
would require
an artifact of great power.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.388
Oh, how great?

20:33.525 --> 20:35.402
Turn it over.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.003
Fucking dwarves.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.465
All this for
a leather jacket?

20:56.632 --> 20:59.426
Lou Reed's leather jacket!

20:59.593 --> 21:02.262
It's the most powerful item
in the whole mall.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.222
Great.

21:06.892 --> 21:08.769
Look, just buy the jacket,

21:08.936 --> 21:10.646
get Chatty back there
to etch the spear,

21:10.812 --> 21:12.397
and we're back in Cairo
in time for dinner.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.483
I'm not spending one cent
of my hard-earned money

21:14.650 --> 21:16.318
on fucking dwarves.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.529
What do you wanna do?

21:27.287 --> 21:28.580
No.

21:30.999 --> 21:34.544
Take good care of that.
We shall return.

21:38.215 --> 21:40.842
Maybe y'all shouldn't dance.
Maybe y'all should just pose.

21:41.009 --> 21:42.928
- I got it. Whoa!
- Donar.

21:43.095 --> 21:45.013
These gentlemen are from
the Friends of New Germany

21:45.180 --> 21:47.099
with a proposition for you,

21:47.265 --> 21:49.851
which I thoroughly endorse.
Manfred, this is Donar.

21:50.018 --> 21:53.438
A pleasure to meet you, Donar.
We really enjoyed your act.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.565
I shall listen
to your proposition.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.151
Well, we wanna sponsor
an American

21:58.318 --> 21:59.903
for the World Weightlifting
Championship

22:00.070 --> 22:01.446
in Chicago this year

22:01.613 --> 22:03.448
and when we saw you
out there on that stage,

22:03.615 --> 22:05.492
we knew you
were our guy.

22:05.659 --> 22:08.412
You see, we're an organization
with American values.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.205
And we see
those values in you.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.874
Strength, confidence,
good breeding.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.210
- Donnie, what's your last name?
- I don't have one.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.295
- Odinson.
- Finnish?

22:17.462 --> 22:19.881
No, no, no, no, no.
You carry on, Manfred, carry on.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.925
Sign on with us,
we'll take care of everything.

22:22.092 --> 22:24.011
All you have to do is show up
and bring the muscle.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.388
- Interested?
- Of course he is.

22:26.555 --> 22:28.473
Great.
So, we'll feed you,

22:28.640 --> 22:30.559
we'll put you up, give you
a little shave and a haircut.

22:30.726 --> 22:33.562
All you have to do is
just lift the heavy things.

22:36.857 --> 22:39.568
I accept your proposition,
Fiend of Germany.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.029
Friend of Germany.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.906
- Friend.
- That's my boy!

22:45.532 --> 22:48.869
Wonderful. Oh, well, be at
this address tomorrow at 1:00

22:49.036 --> 22:50.662
and we'll get started.

22:50.829 --> 22:53.832
Oh, we'll be there
with bells on.

22:57.294 --> 23:00.464
Oh ho! Hot dog! Donar Odinson.
You know what this means?

23:00.630 --> 23:02.466
They want me to be
their champion.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.551
Oh, no. It's much more
than that.

23:04.718 --> 23:06.470
Oh, this is...
this is a resurrection!

23:06.636 --> 23:08.221
Those jackbooted idiots
will elevate you

23:08.388 --> 23:10.098
to your former glory!

23:10.265 --> 23:12.893
What do you think, my dear, huh?
Can't you see my son,

23:13.060 --> 23:15.395
towering over the Windy City
with his hammer?

23:15.979 --> 23:20.192
Oh, lesser Gods and New Gods
could only dream of such glory,

23:20.358 --> 23:21.985
such godly magnificence.

23:22.152 --> 23:25.030
You are gonna elevate
our entire pantheon.

23:26.323 --> 23:28.408
Why were they wearing
the flanged thwarts?

23:29.618 --> 23:31.411
They were Nazis, weren't they?

23:31.578 --> 23:33.663
They're sheep
in search of a shepherd.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.917
Like he is a God
in search of worshippers.

23:37.084 --> 23:39.503
Make me proud, my son.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.465
Oh, yes!

23:43.632 --> 23:46.176
American Nazis.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.888
Well, you heard Grimnir.
It's a resurrection.

23:51.014 --> 23:52.682
But they frighten me, Donnie.

23:55.811 --> 23:58.688
They're only men.
They're nothing to be afraid of.

23:58.855 --> 24:01.233
I shall win the Championships,

24:01.399 --> 24:04.236
and all across the country
they'll be chanting my name.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.655
Even as far away as California.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.158
California.

24:10.325 --> 24:15.038
I will win. And when I do,
we can go wherever we want.

24:17.582 --> 24:20.669
Donnie, do ya mean it?
Do ya really mean it?

24:24.464 --> 24:26.258
I guess you do mean it.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.262
Now, scram.

27:27.731 --> 27:30.817
He was a moody Jewish
kid from Long Island.

27:30.984 --> 27:34.404
A destructive, drug-addled
genius who defined an era

27:34.571 --> 27:37.365
by dredging the depths
of his soul

27:37.532 --> 27:40.660
and setting them to the music
of a badly tuned guitar.

27:41.244 --> 27:45.457
Oh, this jacket has rubbed
shoulders with David Bowie,

27:45.623 --> 27:48.126
Grace Jones,
Iggy Pop, Patti Smith.

27:48.293 --> 27:51.588
- Wow!
- And it simply must be mine.

27:51.755 --> 27:53.673
What? No way. You're a...

27:53.840 --> 27:55.759
- Bishop?
- Yeah!

27:55.925 --> 27:57.927
Hammersmith. Drove all
the way up from Lincoln

27:58.094 --> 27:59.763
just to see it in person.

27:59.929 --> 28:02.640
Now you know my name
and my other passion, Carl.

28:02.807 --> 28:05.060
Well, I'll be. I just...
I never thought I'd sell Lou

28:05.226 --> 28:07.437
to a man of the cloth.
You're a super fan, huh?

28:07.604 --> 28:11.858
Oh, yeah. Oh, I've had my wild
times, though, in the past.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.943
Great rock and roll,
like faith,

28:14.110 --> 28:16.988
can never really be shaken
from the viscera of one's soul.

28:17.155 --> 28:20.241
Yeah, tell me about it.
I'm a Chili's fan myself.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.577
I loved 'em in high school;
I love 'em now.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.038
My band does a sick cover
of "Otherside."

28:25.997 --> 28:28.083
Yeah, man. Here she is.

28:28.249 --> 28:31.336
A jacket worn and signed
by Lou Reed himself.

28:31.503 --> 28:34.881
All for the low retail cost
of $7,500.

28:35.048 --> 28:36.758
Cash or charge?

28:40.178 --> 28:41.471
Cash?

28:43.181 --> 28:46.810
Cash. Okay. Wow.
You wanna try this puppy on?

28:46.976 --> 28:48.895
Is Martin Luther a Lutheran?

28:49.062 --> 28:50.730
Yes?

28:50.897 --> 28:53.858
I have no idea.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.028
- Let's do this thing.
- All right.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.615
Eight, nine, ten is seven,

29:00.782 --> 29:02.992
and one, two, three, four, five
makes us even.

29:03.159 --> 29:04.994
I'm just gonna check
these last few bills

29:05.161 --> 29:06.788
and I'll write you
a receipt, okay?

29:06.955 --> 29:09.207
Tell me,
do you guys work on commission?

29:09.374 --> 29:11.084
No. Afraid not.

29:12.293 --> 29:15.171
Perhaps you'd accept
this as a tip, then.

29:16.297 --> 29:18.007
I really shouldn't.

29:18.508 --> 29:20.593
But, yeah,
bless you, Bishop.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.720
- No, bless you, Carl.
- Hands up, Al.

29:22.887 --> 29:26.266
Oh, buddy! What are you doing?
This man's a bishop!

29:26.433 --> 29:29.394
Yeah, and I'm Beyoncé.
Cuff him, boys.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.940
Appreciate it.
I'm Agent Andy Haddock.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.984
United States Secret Service.

29:36.151 --> 29:39.279
- What's this man wanted for?
- Counterfeiting.

29:39.446 --> 29:42.449
Out here circulating fake
bills all across the Midwest.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.784
Well, I checked his bills
and they're real.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.580
- You use an iodine pen?
- Yeah.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.206
Well, that's your problem.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.292
Al here's using a fiber-based
paper for his fake bills

29:52.459 --> 29:54.961
so pen don't catch 'em.
Can I check some bills here?

29:56.212 --> 29:57.422
Yeah.

30:02.552 --> 30:03.803
Thank you.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.557
These are good.
These are getting real...

30:07.724 --> 30:09.809
You're getting real good
at this, ain't you, Al?

30:11.311 --> 30:13.062
But, uh, yeah, lemme see.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.067
Here you go.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.028
See where he springs
for the paper...

30:23.406 --> 30:25.200
...skimps on the ink.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.328
Well, I'll be.

30:30.288 --> 30:31.664
This everything?

30:33.124 --> 30:36.085
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.546
- May I say--
- Would you shut up?

30:38.713 --> 30:40.632
Gentlemen, could you please
just give me some space?

30:40.798 --> 30:42.342
I appreciate that.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.178
Oh, ah, what about the jacket?

30:45.345 --> 30:47.388
I'm sorry,
but that's evidence now.

30:47.555 --> 30:50.099
In fact, you'll have to get down
the local police station.

30:50.266 --> 30:53.019
They'll be able to tell you
when you get all this back.

30:53.186 --> 30:57.899
You get any problems,
you just give them my name.

31:00.109 --> 31:01.194
Okay.

31:02.195 --> 31:03.821
- And Carl?
- Yeah.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.491
You did real good today.

31:06.658 --> 31:08.409
On behalf of the United States
Government,

31:09.911 --> 31:11.496
you have served your country.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.090
Wasn't sure how the Bishop Game

31:22.257 --> 31:24.175
was gonna play
to a modern crowd

31:24.342 --> 31:27.095
but that wasn't half bad, huh?

31:27.595 --> 31:30.682
No. We'll just hide out here
until the mall closes.

31:30.848 --> 31:33.059
Yeah. Then we'll take
the jacket to Dvalin.

31:33.226 --> 31:35.687
May I say how terrific you
were back there, Agent Haddock?

31:35.853 --> 31:37.855
Now, will you uncuff me, please?

31:39.315 --> 31:42.068
How 'bout first you tell me
about that son of yours?

31:46.072 --> 31:47.865
This an interrogation?

31:48.783 --> 31:50.326
Yeah. Maybe.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.457
Answer the question.

31:58.585 --> 31:59.961
Former son.

32:01.004 --> 32:02.130
He died.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.843
From what I've read,
Thor was the son of Odin.

32:09.637 --> 32:14.058
Donar was his... taken name.
Germanic for thunder.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.311
And, yes,
you remind me of him.

32:17.729 --> 32:18.980
Spitting image.

32:19.147 --> 32:20.607
No, no.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.276
Many, many shades lighter

32:23.443 --> 32:27.238
but you do share many...
similar characteristics.

32:29.741 --> 32:33.453
I don't understand. I don't
get it. How does Thor die?

32:33.620 --> 32:35.538
Zorya, I understand.

32:35.705 --> 32:37.624
She didn't have any believers
left, it makes sense.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.500
But Thor?
Everybody knows who Thor is.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.794
Why didn't he come back?

32:44.213 --> 32:49.260
There are certain deaths
our kind cannot come back from.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.723
What kind of deaths are those?

32:58.102 --> 33:00.104
This interrogation is over.

33:16.871 --> 33:18.748
<i>How high will he rise?</i>

33:18.915 --> 33:20.833
<i>America's golden boy
does it again.</i>

33:28.257 --> 33:30.176
<i>Donar strikes again!</i>

33:30.343 --> 33:32.345
<i>The world's strongest
man! America's pride.</i>

33:32.512 --> 33:35.264
<i>Donnie Odinson,
representing America!</i>

33:38.017 --> 33:39.936
I hope you'll
consider my proposal

33:40.103 --> 33:42.230
very carefully,
Mr. Odinson.

33:42.939 --> 33:47.402
I wouldn't want you,
or your friends, to regret it.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.405
Good day.

33:57.995 --> 34:02.709
It helps if you breathe in slow,
like this...

34:05.086 --> 34:08.381
And then breathe out, very slow,

34:09.549 --> 34:11.050
through your mouth.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.969
Also helps to count:

34:13.886 --> 34:17.974
one, two, three...

34:19.308 --> 34:21.477
You can laugh, scream, cry,

34:21.644 --> 34:23.688
take your hammer
and bust somebody head wide

34:23.855 --> 34:25.857
the fuck open
'til the white show.

34:28.526 --> 34:30.111
You got plenty of choices.

34:31.404 --> 34:35.533
But first, you have got
to get a hold of yourself.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.035
It's Manfred.

34:38.202 --> 34:40.830
He demands I lose
to the German contestant.

34:40.997 --> 34:42.915
He wants me to let Germany win.

34:43.082 --> 34:44.834
I'm sorry, Donar.

34:46.461 --> 34:47.712
I'm sorry.

34:47.879 --> 34:49.422
Why?

34:50.381 --> 34:51.883
You know why.

34:52.049 --> 34:54.635
I'm stronger than the German;
everyone knows that!

34:54.802 --> 34:57.054
Why would they sponsor me
just to have me lose?

35:01.559 --> 35:03.227
Let me tell you a story...

35:03.978 --> 35:08.065
...about why they'd want you
to be their Zarathustra.

35:09.358 --> 35:13.154
Once upon a time,
there was a little boy god

35:13.321 --> 35:18.659
born into a woman's world,
where male gods could not rule.

35:18.826 --> 35:23.206
The goddess of all goddesses
loved the little boy god.

35:23.372 --> 35:27.710
She favored him but, still,
he could not rule.

35:29.504 --> 35:32.507
The boy did not accept
his fate.

35:32.673 --> 35:36.469
He traveled through time
to a world

35:36.636 --> 35:39.889
where men were in charge,
so that he could rule.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.725
He made a deal with man

35:42.892 --> 35:46.604
to steal fire lances
from the gods.

35:47.647 --> 35:49.440
Man took that fire...

35:50.441 --> 35:53.986
...and blazed a path
to the world of women

35:54.153 --> 35:56.239
where the boy came from.

35:57.532 --> 36:00.952
They raped. They killed.

36:02.495 --> 36:05.873
They attempted to destroy
his homeland.

36:08.626 --> 36:11.170
I am that boy.

36:13.798 --> 36:17.802
My homeland still exists.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.056
But not for me.

36:24.934 --> 36:28.020
I understand, but if I win
the championship...

36:28.187 --> 36:31.190
You don't want to win
the championship!

36:31.357 --> 36:33.860
- That's not true.
- Rumor has it...

36:34.735 --> 36:38.239
...you didn't even want to
carry your hammer on stage.

36:38.406 --> 36:42.577
Now you want to be
the champion of a rigged game?

36:45.872 --> 36:49.959
There is no honor in that.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.212
Stop giving away
your worship, boy.

36:53.546 --> 36:55.673
You are not like them.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.426
You are different.

37:00.136 --> 37:03.306
You are beautiful. Hmm?

37:04.765 --> 37:06.142
Donar.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.064
Good night, Nancy.

37:17.028 --> 37:18.779
Alright now.

37:29.624 --> 37:32.335
Dvalin, son of Ymir.

37:33.461 --> 37:35.212
Let this give you strength.

37:35.379 --> 37:37.924

37:39.216 --> 37:41.594

38:51.288 --> 38:53.290
You started the first war.

38:54.083 --> 38:56.293
You will finish the last.

38:57.878 --> 38:59.588
One more step.

39:01.549 --> 39:04.802
With you, I will not fail.

39:04.969 --> 39:07.054
♪ Vicious ♪

39:24.405 --> 39:26.198

39:26.365 --> 39:29.243
The runes have been etched.

39:30.619 --> 39:33.873
Things are happening
ahead of schedule.

39:34.915 --> 39:37.626
Oh.
So, like... how much ahead?

39:37.793 --> 39:39.837
'Cause I'm gonna need
more tech support

39:40.004 --> 39:42.173
if you wanna live-stream
before the launch date.

39:44.341 --> 39:47.303
Then you shall have it.

39:48.262 --> 39:51.766
The fellows in the Valley
assure me

39:51.932 --> 39:55.186
that our new friend...

39:56.437 --> 39:58.981
...will be ready in time.

40:01.358 --> 40:04.779
The wind stirs the
branches in the trees.

40:09.867 --> 40:12.912
The storm is coming.

40:31.305 --> 40:33.099
You missed my act.

40:34.809 --> 40:37.228
I needed to clear my head.

40:38.896 --> 40:40.731
What's going on, Donar?

40:53.536 --> 40:55.162
We should go to California.

40:55.329 --> 40:58.624
- Now. Tonight.
- Oh, Donnie! Are you serious?

41:04.547 --> 41:06.465
It'll be the adventure
of a lifetime.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.551
We'll hop on a bus
and wake up on the open road.

41:08.717 --> 41:11.220
Just meet me at the backstage
door after the last show.

41:15.599 --> 41:17.560
I pledge myself to you,
Columbia.

41:17.726 --> 41:19.436
And I you, Donar.

41:32.616 --> 41:34.493
Columbia, dear.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.328
Uh, one minute, Al!

41:37.663 --> 41:39.456
Key.

41:45.212 --> 41:46.755
Come on in.

41:47.798 --> 41:49.717
I want to introduce you
to a friend of mine.

41:49.884 --> 41:51.802
He's also a big fan of yours.

41:51.969 --> 41:53.888
I've been looking
for that thing everywhere!

41:54.054 --> 41:56.015
- You naughty boy, you.
- Columbia,

41:56.182 --> 41:57.975
the pleasure is mine.

41:59.602 --> 42:02.062
- What are you?
- The future.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.316
Your future.

42:05.482 --> 42:07.943
He's got a proposition for you,

42:08.110 --> 42:10.279
which I thoroughly endorse.

42:15.117 --> 42:17.119
The country,
as you probably know,

42:17.286 --> 42:19.496
is on the brink
of another war.

42:20.497 --> 42:22.875
Is it? I've been
out of the loop.

42:24.210 --> 42:26.837
America needs a goddess
of substance

42:27.004 --> 42:29.089
to take us into the fight.

42:30.049 --> 42:33.844
My associates and I
know all about you.

42:34.011 --> 42:36.555
Hoo, boy!

42:36.722 --> 42:39.141
You were doing great until

42:39.308 --> 42:43.395
Mademoiselle Liberty came along
and stole your thunder.

42:45.814 --> 42:48.734
You're surviving...
for now.

42:49.985 --> 42:51.862
Thanks to Al here.

42:52.488 --> 42:56.700
But pretty soon,
the people will forget

42:56.867 --> 42:58.994
and no amount of sequins
will stop

42:59.161 --> 43:01.622
that fantastic
rack of yours

43:01.789 --> 43:03.874
from going the way of the dodo.

43:06.585 --> 43:08.295
She's Roman, actually.

43:08.462 --> 43:10.923
- What?
- Libertas.

43:11.090 --> 43:13.300
Resurrected by the French
as a gift to the Americans.

43:13.467 --> 43:15.386
Funny old world.

43:15.552 --> 43:19.265
Hm. Roman, French...

43:19.431 --> 43:21.558
Whatever.

43:21.725 --> 43:24.270
It's the American way of life
we're concerned about.

43:24.436 --> 43:28.023
And we believe you have
the power to save it.

43:28.899 --> 43:32.194
With a-a little less...

43:33.404 --> 43:34.822
Buffalo Bill...

43:36.907 --> 43:41.662
And a little more
Our Lady of the War Effort.

43:50.129 --> 43:52.172
I need a minute
to think about it.

43:57.761 --> 44:00.889
Take as much time as you need.

44:10.399 --> 44:11.942
I need to speak with Donar.

44:12.109 --> 44:14.778
He left with the Germans.
Didn't he talk to you?

44:17.781 --> 44:20.117
- Left?
- Boy's ship came in.

44:20.284 --> 44:23.787
I guess he's busy
building his immortality.

44:26.957 --> 44:29.668
That's what you should do, too.

44:29.835 --> 44:32.838
Manifest your own destiny.

44:53.484 --> 44:55.069
Where are you off?

44:58.197 --> 45:00.324
I'm going to California
with Columbia.

45:01.367 --> 45:03.994
- What about the championship?
- I won't be their puppet.

45:04.161 --> 45:07.039
Humans serve us,
not the other way around.

45:07.915 --> 45:10.459
Don't be stupid, Donar;
worship is worship.

45:10.626 --> 45:14.421
No! I will forge my own path
with the woman I love

45:14.588 --> 45:16.965
and our children will populate
the western lands.

45:19.051 --> 45:22.429
I... I don't know
how to tell you this but, um...

45:23.472 --> 45:25.265
she ain't coming.

45:26.392 --> 45:29.144
What do you mean?
Of course she is.

45:29.311 --> 45:33.023
Columbia has decided
to explore other opportunities.

45:33.190 --> 45:36.860
You did this. You used
your charms on her!

45:37.027 --> 45:38.946
I wish that I had, my son,

45:39.113 --> 45:41.281
then I could reverse them,
but look on the bright side:

45:41.448 --> 45:45.077
the liberation has enabled you
to fulfill your destiny.

45:45.244 --> 45:49.039
Throw the match.
Secure the worship!

45:49.206 --> 45:50.791
No, Father.

45:50.958 --> 45:52.751
No?

45:55.921 --> 45:59.716
No? Oh, yes. You will do this.

45:59.883 --> 46:03.262
Otherwise, there's no place
in the theater for you.

46:03.429 --> 46:05.639
You think you have
a show without me?

46:06.432 --> 46:08.267
It's me they come to see.

46:08.434 --> 46:11.353
Me! Donar the Great!

46:26.452 --> 46:28.704
Do not disrespect me, son.

46:29.204 --> 46:31.415
Remove the charm
you put on Columbia.

46:31.582 --> 46:33.834
Charms do not work
on our own kind.

46:34.376 --> 46:36.253
Columbia has chosen
to make something of her life,

46:36.420 --> 46:38.255
unlike my coward of a son.

46:38.422 --> 46:40.090
Or my failure of a father!

47:13.123 --> 47:14.708
Such strength...

47:16.376 --> 47:18.754
only a fraction
of what's to come.

47:22.007 --> 47:27.221
Oh, my boy, power like this
you cannot walk away from!

47:30.599 --> 47:31.850
Goodbye, Father.

47:34.186 --> 47:37.564
No!!!

48:03.757 --> 48:05.634
If I, uh...

48:07.052 --> 48:09.721
If I upset you back there...

48:09.888 --> 48:11.557
It wasn't you.

48:12.599 --> 48:14.726
Ghosts from the past.

48:23.235 --> 48:25.445
What happened
to Donar?

48:28.365 --> 48:30.617
Sacrifice is
the only noble act.

48:30.784 --> 48:34.621
As gods, it's our sustenance
and currency.

48:36.373 --> 48:38.000
I regret nothing.

48:48.594 --> 48:50.345
He checked out..

48:51.513 --> 48:53.265
1942.

48:54.433 --> 48:56.435
Somewhere outside
of Philadelphia.

48:58.145 --> 48:59.730
So I heard.

48:59.896 --> 49:01.857
Suicide.

49:02.024 --> 49:03.942
Suicide:
that's the kind of death

49:04.109 --> 49:06.153
that Gods can't come back from.

49:10.991 --> 49:13.035
Did the Valkyries provide
safe passage?

49:16.913 --> 49:18.206
Honestly?

49:22.044 --> 49:23.670
