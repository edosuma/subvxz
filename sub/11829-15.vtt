00:23.960 --> 00:26.890
Don't do anything stupid,Ricky.
Don't hit the guy. It's okay.

00:26.930 --> 00:29.140
-It's never gonna be okay.
-Yeah,probably not.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.000
My father is not
a law-abiding citizen.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.050
He doesn't care if
there's a restraining order.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.010
Here's my dad's number.
He'll help you.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.360
I want to consider adoption.
I'd appreciate you going along with that.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.770
I found something for you to do
for your community service.

00:40.810 --> 00:42.030
How'd you like to mentor a kid?

00:42.060 --> 00:42.900
Yeah,I'll do it.

00:42.940 --> 00:44.210
You know how much some families

00:44.240 --> 00:47.460
would pay for a healthy,Caucasian baby?

00:54.320 --> 00:55.950
I gotta go.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.810
No-- Whoa,whoa.

00:57.840 --> 01:02.140
No,you can't just have sex like
that and leave me here alone.

01:02.180 --> 01:05.710
Sorry. Then again,I think you say
that every time I leave your house,

01:05.760 --> 01:08.090
so maybe you can just
not say anything for once.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.130
Are you angry with me?

01:11.220 --> 01:12.500
After that?

01:12.530 --> 01:14.040
I'm not angry with you.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.360
You're angry.

01:15.410 --> 01:17.150
Yeah,well,I'm angry with someone else.

01:17.180 --> 01:17.800
Good night.

01:17.830 --> 01:20.370
No,wait,please,just wait.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.430
Who are you angry with? Grace?

01:22.460 --> 01:24.420
No,not Grace. Good night.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.190
No. Ricky.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.000
Ricky.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.690
How can you be angry with anyone
after what we just did?

01:30.720 --> 01:32.520
I just can,all right? I have to go.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.200
Ricky,please.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.880
This is as close as
I've ever felt to you.

01:37.910 --> 01:39.800
Tonight. In there.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.010
Just talk to me,please.

01:42.050 --> 01:44.310
I don't feel like talking to you.
It's personal.

01:44.350 --> 01:45.890
More personal than sex?

01:45.930 --> 01:48.180
Yeah,a lot more personal than sex.

01:48.220 --> 01:49.470
Come on,Ricky.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.700
Look,just don't run away tonight,okay?

01:51.730 --> 01:54.450
Just talk to me.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.050
Just tell me what this is about.
You can tell me.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.590
I can't.

01:58.630 --> 02:00.170
You can if you want.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.620
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.960
Whatever it is,
I'm not gonna say anything.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.050
Don't you know me
better than that by now?

02:07.080 --> 02:09.090
No. And you don't know me either.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.009
Well,then let's get to know each other.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.480
Okay,you want to get to know me?

02:15.510 --> 02:17.430
You want to know who I am?

02:18.370 --> 02:21.590
The reason I'm in foster care
is not just because my dad

02:21.620 --> 02:24.370
smacked me around
and smacked my mom around.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.130
It's not just because
they were both drug addicts,

02:26.170 --> 02:29.650
and abandoned me over and over again.

02:30.080 --> 02:35.060
It's because my dad used to come
home after a long day of hanging out

02:35.090 --> 02:37.780
and getting high to
teach me a little lesson

02:37.820 --> 02:40.950
in how hard it is
to be a man in this world.

02:41.650 --> 02:44.580
That's what he called it:
"A little lesson."

02:44.630 --> 02:47.700
Every night,I'd be in bed
with my door closed,

02:47.750 --> 02:50.710
just begging God that
he wouldn't come in my room

02:50.750 --> 02:52.550
for one of his little lessons.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.900
But night after night after night,

02:58.620 --> 03:00.240
there he was.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.850
And when I couldn't take
it anymore, when I hated him enough,

03:03.880 --> 03:07.110
when I really didn't care
if I lived or died,

03:08.210 --> 03:10.870
I told my teacher at school
and she told someone,

03:10.920 --> 03:12.970
and then they told someone else.

03:13.010 --> 03:16.820
And eventually,but believe me,
not quickly,eventually,

03:16.880 --> 03:18.770
he went off to prison.

03:18.790 --> 03:21.620
But guess what? He's back,
and he's hanging around.

03:22.630 --> 03:23.370
Yeah.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.060
He went to see Amy and
then he came around

03:25.110 --> 03:27.900
when I was with Grace,
so lock your doors,

03:27.930 --> 03:30.190
because he'll probably show up here too.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.040
Not that he's interested
in you or Grace or Amy.

03:33.420 --> 03:37.170
No,he's just interested in me.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.200
In hurting me.

03:39.230 --> 03:41.720
He actually wants me to make
someone pay for my baby

03:41.760 --> 03:43.740
and then give him the money.

03:43.780 --> 03:46.240
Then he'll leave me alone.

03:46.270 --> 03:47.590
Nice,huh?

03:47.610 --> 03:51.010
Ricky,I'm so sorry.

03:51.050 --> 03:52.990
Let me help you,okay?

03:53.020 --> 03:54.720
I-- I can talk to my dad.

03:54.770 --> 03:56.240
He can help you.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.470
No one can help me.

04:19.470 --> 04:20.410
Adrian?

04:20.450 --> 04:21.140
Everything okay?

04:21.180 --> 04:22.380
No.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.900
What's wrong?

04:23.940 --> 04:25.350
Ricky was just here.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.670
And?

04:26.700 --> 04:27.990
Did you know?

04:28.020 --> 04:29.250
Did I know what?

04:29.300 --> 04:31.168
That his father was in prison

04:31.203 --> 04:36.550
for sexually abusing him
and for drugs and for
God knows what else?

04:36.590 --> 04:38.290
I can't discuss that.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.200
But you knew.

04:40.230 --> 04:41.320
I knew.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.330
Then put him back in prison.

04:43.380 --> 04:44.580
Honey,I can't.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.040
He's on parole.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.870
And as long as he follows
the conditions of his parole,

04:47.910 --> 04:49.090
there's nothing I can do.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.200
I don't believe that.

04:50.230 --> 04:51.400
Have the cops follow him around.

04:51.430 --> 04:53.700
Make him break the
conditions of his parole.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.850
As an officer of the court,

04:54.900 --> 04:57.460
I cannot mandate any
law-enforcement agency

04:57.490 --> 05:00.710
to spend an exorbitant amount
of resources on one individual

05:00.740 --> 05:02.760
who,if he's following
the parole agreement,

05:02.800 --> 05:05.100
he's not an apparent danger to anyone.

05:05.150 --> 05:07.140
Really?  You believe that?

05:07.170 --> 05:10.970
He's not an apparent danger to anyone?

05:12.390 --> 05:15.060
Dad,please.

05:15.090 --> 05:17.570
I'm doing the best I can,honey.

What are you doing?

05:44.210 --> 05:45.750
What's it look like? I'm shaving.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.130
I can see that,but why are
you shaving in my kitchen?

05:48.170 --> 05:49.510
I'm tired of shaving
with the garden hose.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.990
My skin's getting chapped.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.260
George,there are three
bathrooms in this house.

05:53.290 --> 05:54.750
Yeah,and three women.

05:54.780 --> 05:56.170
[SIGHS] Good morning.

05:56.210 --> 05:57.890
- Morning,Buttercup.- Good morning.

05:58.990 --> 06:02.280
do you think it's okay if I go
to a friend's house after school?

06:04.500 --> 06:07.360
A friend's house after school?

06:07.410 --> 06:08.460
You have a friend?

06:08.500 --> 06:09.370
George.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.990
You're not thinking the same thing?

06:11.020 --> 06:12.940
I think it's wonderful
that you have a friend

06:12.980 --> 06:14.860
and that you're getting
out of the house

06:14.890 --> 06:17.080
and doing something with
someone outside the family.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.110
So,what's her name?

06:18.140 --> 06:19.800
What makes you so sure it's a her?

06:19.830 --> 06:22.160
Oh. So it's a boyfriend friend?

06:22.190 --> 06:24.260
No,it's a gender-non-specific friend.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.000
What's going on?

06:28.040 --> 06:30.390
Your sister has a friend.

06:30.430 --> 06:32.050
Really?

06:32.090 --> 06:32.800
Yes,really.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.070
Why is it such a surprise
that I have a friend?

06:35.890 --> 06:38.340
I'm a very,very friendly person.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.590
All right,well,um,

06:44.620 --> 06:46.640
I'll just-- I'll be in the car.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.950
So I'll pick you up after
last period,okay?

06:49.990 --> 06:51.240
Yeah. Sounds good.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.650
- I can pick her up. - No,you can't.

06:52.690 --> 06:54.380
You're working,George.

06:54.410 --> 06:55.520
At least I hope you are.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.940
I can still pick her up.

06:56.980 --> 06:58.470
I have a doctor's appointment.

06:58.850 --> 07:01.790
She said I might be able to find
out the sex of the baby today.

07:01.810 --> 07:03.900
Really? And then you'll tell me.
I'd love to have a boy.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.810
I got two girls,
so a grandson would be great.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.920
You know,or a granddaughter.

07:10.660 --> 07:11.960
Bye.

07:14.820 --> 07:15.540
What?

07:15.570 --> 07:17.580
She's leaning towards adoption.
You know that.

07:17.620 --> 07:18.840
That's already been decided?

07:18.860 --> 07:20.980
No,it hasn't, but I think
it's what she wants.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.540
What she wants or what you want?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.620
I think it's really
what she wants,George.

07:24.660 --> 07:27.290
She isn't sure she wants to
know if it's a boy or a girl.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.340
Is this because of Ricky?

07:28.380 --> 07:30.230
She doesn't want Ricky and
his dad coming around?

07:30.260 --> 07:31.400
Did you scare her with that?

07:31.440 --> 07:32.450
No. I didn't.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.590
It's about nothing except for
the fact that Amy thinks

07:34.640 --> 07:37.080
that this might be the best
choice for her baby.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.210
Let's go,let's go.
I got things to do today.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.620
Oh,yeah. Me too.

07:51.650 --> 07:52.450
What's with the camera?

07:52.490 --> 07:54.100
We're finding out
the sex of the baby.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.700
And according to the information
I got from the Internet,

07:56.730 --> 07:59.410
this is a moment that should
be recorded for history.

07:59.450 --> 08:01.440
- By? - By...?

08:01.490 --> 08:03.170
Amy's borrowing your camera,right?

08:03.210 --> 08:05.540
No. I'm gonna be there with her.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.850
You're gonna be there when she
finds out the sex of the baby?

08:07.880 --> 08:08.780
Yeah. Of course.

08:08.820 --> 08:09.940
You know how they find that out?

08:09.970 --> 08:11.810
Yeah. It's called a sonogram.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.060
Yeah. And she's gonna be
laying on a table

08:14.090 --> 08:15.690
with her whole stomach exposed.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.450
Have you seen Amy's stomach before?

08:17.480 --> 08:20.660
Well,that's kind of
a personal question,isn't it?

08:20.710 --> 08:23.180
Not as personal as you being
there and seeing her stomach.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.090
-They can cover it.
-They don't cover it.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
It-- It'll be fine.

08:26.190 --> 08:28.130
I mean,it's-- It's just a stomach.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.110
No,it's not.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.900
It's a very intimate moment
between the mother and the baby,

08:31.950 --> 08:33.419
and usually the father of the baby.

08:33.450 --> 08:35.020
And it's very emotional.

08:35.049 --> 08:36.770
I mean,given Amy's situation,

08:36.799 --> 08:39.530
I would think she'd feel really
vulnerable at a moment like that

08:39.570 --> 08:42.400
and would be much more comfortable
with her mother there than you.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.280
- She wants me to be there.
- You sure?

08:44.310 --> 08:46.230
- Yeah,I'm sure.
- I don't recommend it.

08:46.270 --> 08:47.460
It'll be fine.

08:47.510 --> 08:49.710
I'm not worried about
you as much as Amy.

08:49.750 --> 08:52.090
I can't imagine that
she would want you there.

08:52.120 --> 08:55.200
She's my wife. I know,I know.
We're not married legally,

08:55.240 --> 08:56.840
but we might as well be.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.480
We're in love and we're
in this relationship for life.

08:59.510 --> 09:02.030
And this is a big part
of that relationship,today,

09:02.070 --> 09:03.500
finding out the sex of the baby.

09:03.530 --> 09:05.870
I have to be there.
Amy wants me to be there.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.100
Just like she wants
me there for the birth.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.470
Yeah,okay,Benjamin.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.830
We'll see about that.

09:11.850 --> 09:12.670
We'll see about what?

09:12.710 --> 09:14.340
Come on. Let's go,already.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.890
Be there for the birth.

09:17.710 --> 09:19.050
Come on.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.170
What do you call this again?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.600
Earl Grey.

09:23.190 --> 09:24.460
It's not bad.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.530
I have coffee.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.650
No,no,no. That's okay.

09:26.690 --> 09:28.000
When in Rome...

09:30.070 --> 09:32.410
Well,I'm very happy you stopped by.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.250
I wish my wife were
here to talk to you.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.320
She's,uh-- Well,she's
been wanting to talk to you.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.800
But neither of us wanted
to intrude on the situation.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.750
I don't know why not.
The whole world has intruded.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.810
It's not like it's a secret.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.640
So,what do you think Amy is going to do?

09:44.680 --> 09:46.100
Is she thinking about adoption?

09:46.140 --> 09:47.470
Ricky said she's thinking about it,

09:47.500 --> 09:50.160
but I'm not sure he's totally
onboard with that right now,

09:50.890 --> 09:52.840
especially since his
father has been coming around

09:52.870 --> 09:55.060
looking for money from the adoption.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.860
Bob the child molester is
looking for money for the baby?

09:57.900 --> 10:00.340
Maybe Ricky didn't tell Amy,but yes.

10:00.370 --> 10:01.980
Bob said he'd help out financially.

10:02.030 --> 10:02.930
Bob has no money.

10:02.980 --> 10:06.200
Bob the child molester
is also Bob the drug addict.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.150
That son of a-- I want to--

10:08.180 --> 10:09.110
We do too.

10:09.140 --> 10:10.430
But we all know we can't.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.630
Do we? Maybe that's
just the tea talking.

10:12.660 --> 10:13.810
Adrian's father--

10:13.850 --> 10:14.580
Do you know Adrian?

10:14.620 --> 10:15.820
I know him. What about Adrian?

10:15.850 --> 10:17.560
Is her father a child molester too?

10:17.600 --> 10:18.850
No,no.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.350
He's the DA.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.050
He got us a restraining order,

10:22.080 --> 10:23.770
and he's asked the police
to keep an eye out.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.250
What,in case anyone kills Bob?

10:25.280 --> 10:26.510
Let's not resort to violence.

10:26.550 --> 10:28.790
Let's not put ourselves on Bob's level.

10:28.810 --> 10:31.020
Let's put Bob down a level.
Like six feet under.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.690
He wanted money for the baby?

10:32.720 --> 10:36.060
Mr. Juergens,Bob will not
last long in the real world.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.540
Sooner or later,he's gonna do something

10:37.580 --> 10:40.110
that will violate his parole
and he'll go back to prison.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.430
Should we do something to Bob

10:41.470 --> 10:43.550
before Bob does something
to go back to prison?

10:43.580 --> 10:45.110
There's nothing we can do.

10:45.130 --> 10:47.430
No? There's gotta be
something we can do.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.120
I'm not gonna sit around
drinking Earl Grey,

10:49.160 --> 10:50.760
waiting for Bob to go back to prison.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.840
Don't do anything stupid,George.

10:52.870 --> 10:54.580
Yeah,story of my life.

10:58.020 --> 11:00.050
So that's why he showed up
at the batting cages.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.030
He wants money from the adoption.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.140
So you and Amy have decided
to have the baby adopted?

11:06.160 --> 11:07.760
No,at least I haven't.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.300
I don't want anything
to do with an adoption,

11:09.340 --> 11:11.020
which is only gonna make Bob angry.

11:11.060 --> 11:12.660
I mean,he's an angry man already.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.230
Look,I wouldn't want
to ruin your morning,

11:14.265 --> 11:16.810
so I'll spare you the details
of what my father did to me.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.530
Ricky,you can tell us anything.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.133
Don't worry about our morning,okay?

11:20.168 --> 11:21.580
It's not okay.

11:21.843 --> 11:23.000
I was sexually abused,

11:23.030 --> 11:25.310
and Bob got sent
to prison because of me,

11:25.340 --> 11:27.130
so I don't think Grace
should be around me.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.720
I don't think it's safe.

11:30.350 --> 11:31.720
...Ricky,uh,

11:31.760 --> 11:33.860
Bob was sent to prison because of Bob.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.300
Didn't have anything to do with you.
You know that,don't you?

11:36.330 --> 11:37.940
Yeah,I know that.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.650
Intellectually,I know that.

11:39.690 --> 11:42.840
But still,sometimes it gets
turned around in my head somehow.

11:42.880 --> 11:43.950
Look,I'm working on my problems.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.410
I'm in therapy.
I've been in therapy for years.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.870
And I know I'd never
do anything to hurt Grace.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.300
But I can't say the same about Bob.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.750
I can't say he wouldn't hurt
her if he had the chance.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.200
I think he just wants
to get back at me.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.240
I just don't know how
he plans to do that.

11:58.290 --> 12:00.630
So I'm not gonna come
around for a while

12:00.690 --> 12:02.930
and I was wondering if you
could explain that to Grace.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.000
I can't. I just can't.

12:05.050 --> 12:07.212
I really love her,but I don't
want her to get hurt.

12:07.213 --> 12:09.511
But Bob is very unpredictable.

12:09.546 --> 12:12.500
Ricky,are you sure you can't
tell Grace this yourself?

12:12.530 --> 12:14.230
We can tell her,

12:14.280 --> 12:17.800
but she can hear what you have
to say without any judgment. She can.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.160
Yeah,because she's a Christian.
You're all Christians.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.080
I wish I could be a Christian.

12:22.110 --> 12:24.300
I wish I could believe
what you believe.

12:24.330 --> 12:27.740
I wish Jesus would just take
away my pain and suffering,

12:27.790 --> 12:29.327
but I spent too many
nights praying

12:29.362 --> 12:32.790
for Bob to leave me alone to believe
that prayer ever works.

12:35.730 --> 12:38.750
No,I think you better tell Grace
that I can't see her anymore.

12:38.780 --> 12:40.280
Not right now,anyway.

12:40.310 --> 12:42.930
Look,I have to go.
I'm sorry. I have to go.

12:55.670 --> 12:57.200
No pity,okay?

12:57.230 --> 12:59.060
I don't need pity.
It'll change the sex.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.920
I'm not-- It's not pity.

13:00.950 --> 13:01.950
It's just that--

13:01.990 --> 13:03.810
I don't know,I just--

13:03.850 --> 13:06.130
I think I understand you
a lot better now.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.130
I doubt it.

13:07.170 --> 13:09.040
Besides,I'm not looking
for understanding.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.130
I know what you're looking for.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.980
And you're not gonna
get that from Grace.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.750
I'm not seeing Grace.
I went over to her house

13:15.780 --> 13:18.140
and told her parents that
I'd stay away from her.

13:18.170 --> 13:19.720
And I'm gonna stay away from her.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.500
Because of your dad,

13:21.540 --> 13:23.360
or because she really
isn't what you want?

13:23.390 --> 13:26.130
Or because rejection in any form

13:26.190 --> 13:28.330
is just gonna make her want you more?

13:28.370 --> 13:30.400
I'm not that complicated.

13:30.430 --> 13:31.760
Yes,you are.

13:31.810 --> 13:35.040
Hey,don't make too much out of
what I told you about my dad,okay?

13:35.080 --> 13:35.793
Okay.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.390
Tonight?

13:41.380 --> 13:43.050
He wants to make money off the adoption.

13:43.100 --> 13:46.160
He wants Ricky to give him
a commission on selling Amy's baby.

13:46.200 --> 13:46.700
What?

13:46.760 --> 13:49.160
That's why he showed up.
He wants to get a cut of the money.

13:49.190 --> 13:51.550
Nobody's getting any
money for Amy's baby.

13:51.580 --> 13:52.640
Apparently people do that.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.860
They pay for hospital costs
and taking care of the mother.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.310
Sometimes there's some sort
of cash bonus involved,

13:57.350 --> 13:59.000
disguised as an expense.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.930
Reverend Stone didn't say
anything about that.

14:00.970 --> 14:01.890
That's not gonna happen.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.640
How do you know it's not gonna happen?

14:03.680 --> 14:04.840
How do you know that

14:04.880 --> 14:07.120
there's not gonna be money
under the table to Ricky?

14:07.150 --> 14:09.600
With Bob in the picture,
adoption is a dirty business.

14:09.630 --> 14:11.420
You're the one who wanted
her to do this,not me.

14:11.460 --> 14:13.280
It doesn't have to be
a dirty business.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.320
It's not supposed to be
a dirty business.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.460
It's supposed to be a wonderful
way of providing a child

14:17.500 --> 14:19.490
with a-- A stable and loving family

14:19.540 --> 14:21.940
and giving two people a chance
to have a child who would ordinarily

14:21.970 --> 14:23.560
not be able to have one.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.160
It's just people like Ricky's father
that make it into a dirty business.

14:26.190 --> 14:28.710
We won't have anything to do
with him or anyone like him.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.080
How are we gonna know?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.440
We'll know.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.390
George,don't do anything stupid,please.

14:36.430 --> 14:37.950
Amy is gonna need you.

14:37.990 --> 14:39.330
You need to be here for Amy.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.040
Don't do anything stupid.

14:41.090 --> 14:44.490
What kind of a man
abuses his own son? Pervert.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.280
A very sick man.

14:46.310 --> 14:47.930
Someone who needs some help.

14:47.960 --> 14:48.910
Oh,I'll help him.

14:48.930 --> 14:52.160
George,let the authorities
handle this,please.

14:52.190 --> 14:54.180
You know,if Bob did
what he did to Ricky,

14:54.220 --> 14:58.060
then Ricky could do what he did
to the baby.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.630
That's not fair.

14:59.670 --> 15:01.150
And it's not true.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.840
It doesn't have to be that way.
Just because Ricky was abused

15:03.880 --> 15:05.530
doesn't mean he's gonna
do the same thing.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.090
Ricky can be different from his father.

15:07.130 --> 15:10.590
Get out your dreamcatcher,
because you're dreaming again.

15:07.130 --> 15:10.590
*dreamcatcher*

15:23.730 --> 15:25.170
So,what time is your appointment?

15:25.200 --> 15:27.410
Same time as usual. As soon as
I can get there after school.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.870
So am I riding with you and your mom,

15:29.910 --> 15:31.850
or should I have my dad's
driver drop me off,

15:31.890 --> 15:33.020
or how does that work?

15:33.050 --> 15:35.060
Oh,and I have a digital
camera,but don't worry,

15:35.110 --> 15:37.560
I won't take pictures
unless you want me to.

15:41.050 --> 15:42.950
Uh,you want me to be there,right?

15:42.980 --> 15:45.460
You said you wanted me
to be there,didn't you?

15:45.500 --> 15:47.570
No,I said I wish
you could be there.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.260
Well,I can.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.140
N-no,I wish you could be there.
Like--

15:52.180 --> 15:54.250
Like I wish we were
married,legally.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.400
Like I wish this was our baby.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.890
Like I wish a lot of things.

15:58.930 --> 16:00.200
So you--

16:00.230 --> 16:01.920
You don't want me to be there.

16:01.940 --> 16:03.940
It's kind of personal.

16:04.690 --> 16:06.560
Yeah,I-- I know. But still...

16:06.590 --> 16:08.140
But still think you should go?

16:08.180 --> 16:10.220
Yeah. Ben,I
-- I don't know.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.470
I mean,you've never even
seen my stomach before.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.920
I know. It'll be the first
time I see your stomach.

16:14.950 --> 16:17.570
I'm sure it will be awkward,
but I want to be there for you.

16:17.610 --> 16:18.860
I want to see the baby.

16:18.900 --> 16:22.370
I want to be there with you when
you find out whether it's a girl or a boy.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.210
And,yeah,at first,it'll be awkward,

16:24.240 --> 16:26.450
but we'll work through
the awkwardness.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.610
We love each other.

16:27.660 --> 16:29.060
I don't think so,Ben.

16:29.110 --> 16:31.980
I-I don't even know if I want
to know if it's a boy or a girl.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.510
I'm not even sure
I want to be there.

16:33.540 --> 16:36.020
I know it's gonna be a
very emotional moment for you,

16:36.070 --> 16:38.010
and that's why I want
to be there for you.

16:38.050 --> 16:40.680
But just think about letting me go.

16:40.710 --> 16:41.680
Just think about it.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.340
No. I don't want to think about it.

16:44.390 --> 16:45.930
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

16:45.980 --> 16:47.260
but I don't want you
to be there.

16:47.290 --> 16:49.270
Sorry.I just think
it would be awkward.

16:49.310 --> 16:51.630
Are you gonna let me go
to birthing classes?

16:51.660 --> 16:53.900
Again,I think that would be awkward.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.140
So you don't want me there
when the baby is born.

16:56.190 --> 16:59.100
In the room when I'm completely
exposed to the world?

16:59.140 --> 17:01.660
No. I-- I'm not even sure
I want my mother to be there.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.270
We don't have to make
these decisions now.

17:03.300 --> 17:06.240
I mean,we have months
to think about it.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.440
But please,just consider
the possibility

17:08.480 --> 17:10.560
of letting me be there
when the baby is born.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.180
I-- I mean,I can stay up by your head,

17:12.220 --> 17:14.700
all the way up by your head
and I won't look at anything

17:14.750 --> 17:16.060
you don't want me to see.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.569
Yeah,okay. I'll--
I'll think about it.

17:18.609 --> 17:20.160
I love you.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.829
I love you too.

17:29.730 --> 17:30.669
Coming.

17:31.157 --> 17:32.185
Coming.

17:33.340 --> 17:36.970
Hi. I knew if I called,
you'd tell me not to come over.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.410
Yeah,I probably would.

17:40.150 --> 17:42.070
- Since you're here...
- Really?

17:49.090 --> 17:51.480
I always wondered what this house
would look like on the inside.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.370
It's very you.

17:53.410 --> 17:56.060
Yeah. Well,I bought my own
furniture this time around.

17:56.110 --> 17:58.170
That's a great rocking chair.
Where'd you get that?

17:58.210 --> 18:00.880
My husband bought it
for me when I had Grace.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.780
This would be a great
idea for a baby gift.

18:03.270 --> 18:04.830
What's up,George?

18:04.870 --> 18:07.100
Oh,we gotta talk.

18:07.150 --> 18:08.030
About?

18:08.070 --> 18:09.200
Ricky's dad.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.140
Yeah. I want to kill that guy.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.670
- Me too. - No,George,

18:12.710 --> 18:14.010
I don't mean that literally.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.170
Oh. I do.

18:15.210 --> 18:16.430
What do you mean,literally?

18:16.490 --> 18:18.580
I mean,I hate what
he did to that kid.

18:18.610 --> 18:20.220
Yeah,and Ricky could
do that to his kid,

18:20.250 --> 18:22.370
and his kid is my grandson
or granddaughter,

18:22.420 --> 18:25.030
and I can't ignore the fact
that his father is circling around.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.340
Ricky came by to say that he can't
go out with Grace anymore.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.110
He doesn't want to put her in jeopardy.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.510
Your daughter could be
my daughter's baby's stepmother.

18:31.550 --> 18:33.525
We're a long way from that.
A long,long way.

18:33.560 --> 18:36.000
Grace is going to college
and then to medical school.

18:36.030 --> 18:37.290
George,what do you want?

18:37.320 --> 18:38.780
I want to know how
we're getting rid of Bob.

18:38.810 --> 18:40.880
Don't you two have a plan
to get rid of him?

18:40.910 --> 18:43.540
Rid of him? No. We're gonna
leave that up to the authorities.

18:43.570 --> 18:44.150
I won't do that.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.390
Uh,yeah. We have to.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.650
You're no better than Anne.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.610
I hope your next wife
shares your point of view.

18:48.650 --> 18:50.990
Well,I can only hope so.
Thanks for nothing.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.480
Hey,there.

18:58.740 --> 18:59.950
Don't get out.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.140
All right.

19:02.170 --> 19:03.610
I want to talk to you.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.390
Great.

19:04.430 --> 19:07.850
I'm taking Amy to the doctor today
to find out the sex of her baby.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.180
- Yeah? - Yeah.

19:10.210 --> 19:13.460
And I also found out that you're
trying to get money for Amy's baby.

19:13.510 --> 19:16.960
So,uh,I don't know.
Maybe it's the doctor's appointment,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.730
or everything else that's happening,

19:19.790 --> 19:21.410
but that news just kind of upset me.

19:21.450 --> 19:25.040
Well,it's not just her baby.
There's a father,and that's my son.

19:25.080 --> 19:29.360
So it's actually your daughter's
baby and my son's baby.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.980
So who knows? Maybe someday,
we'll be in-laws.

19:35.270 --> 19:38.260
We are never gonna be in-laws.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.630
And you're not gonna
go anywhere near my daughter

19:40.670 --> 19:42.570
or your son or their baby.

19:42.610 --> 19:43.630
You got that?

19:43.660 --> 19:44.990
Because if you do,

19:45.020 --> 19:48.460
if you go near her or him or the baby,

19:48.510 --> 19:49.950
you're gonna regret it.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.470
Really?

19:51.510 --> 19:52.950
Regret it,you say?

19:52.980 --> 19:54.250
Listen to me.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.780
I'm a woman on the verge.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.880
My 15-year-old daughter
is having a baby.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.770
My husband is having an affair.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.290
I'm getting a divorce after
16 years of marriage.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.380
I gotta get a job.

20:05.430 --> 20:07.350
And my mom has Alzheimer's.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.980
And I can't take it anymore.

20:09.020 --> 20:12.150
I can't take it if one more
bad thing happens to me,

20:12.190 --> 20:14.210
like if I find out that you're
sending couples over

20:14.240 --> 20:17.830
to try to adopt the baby and
you're somehow making money off of it.

20:17.860 --> 20:20.660
So,what are you saying,Anne?
Are you saying--?

20:20.700 --> 20:22.750
I don't know.
Are you threatening me?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.570
Not nice to threaten people.

20:24.610 --> 20:26.520
I'm not threatening you.

20:26.550 --> 20:29.490
I don't even know how
to threaten a man like you.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.260
But I figure you're afraid of me.

20:32.300 --> 20:35.010
I figure you're afraid
of everything and everyone,

20:35.040 --> 20:39.370
because what kind of a man
hits his own wife and child?

20:40.200 --> 20:42.310
I'll tell you what kind.

20:42.350 --> 20:44.130
A coward.

20:44.170 --> 20:47.700
What kind of a man preys
on innocent children?

20:47.750 --> 20:49.740
A coward.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.860
Yeah,that's right.
You're a coward.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.810
I bet you get high
so you can forget that.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.370
That you're a coward.

20:57.410 --> 20:58.860
Am I right?

20:59.590 --> 21:02.000
Just don't go near them,

21:02.050 --> 21:03.484
any of them.

21:04.410 --> 21:05.980
Just go away.

21:06.030 --> 21:08.200
Go far,far away.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.430
Hey,were you looking for me?

21:17.460 --> 21:18.600
Yeah.

21:18.650 --> 21:20.630
I've been looking for you all day.

21:20.910 --> 21:21.600
I'm sorry,Grace.

21:21.630 --> 21:25.040
I just don't think we should
be seeing each other right now.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.330
Okay,but that's just
for right now,right?

21:27.380 --> 21:29.880
It's for as long
as my dad is around.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.260
My parents told me.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.030
They told you?

21:34.090 --> 21:36.110
Everything.

21:36.140 --> 21:38.880
Really,I appreciate that you
don't want me to get hurt,

21:38.910 --> 21:41.010
but I'm not scared to be around you.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.100
Well,you should be.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.790
Well,I'm not.

21:43.830 --> 21:47.820
Ricky,I love you.

21:49.710 --> 21:51.090
I love you.

21:51.130 --> 21:53.190
What do you want me to do?
Say I love you?

21:53.220 --> 21:55.660
I don't love anyone.
I don't even love myself.

21:56.930 --> 21:59.830
But you said you
were in love with me.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.200
I say a lot of things,Grace.

22:05.090 --> 22:08.560
But you're in love with me.
I know you're in love with me.

22:12.860 --> 22:15.010
Aren't you in love with me?

22:21.670 --> 22:25.000
Okay,well,even if you're
not in love with me,

22:25.040 --> 22:27.640
I hope that we can
at least be friends.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.140
I'm gonna pray for that.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.080
That we can be friends.

22:34.110 --> 22:39.920
And,Ricky,I'm gonna pray
that nobody ever hurts you again.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.310
Bye.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.810
call me

22:56.130 --> 22:58.250
So your sister has a friend?

22:58.270 --> 23:00.810
Yeah,she probably has lots of friends.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.830
Do you know who the friend is?

23:05.860 --> 23:07.150
She gave me an address
and a phone number

23:07.190 --> 23:08.590
but it's probably fake.

23:08.620 --> 23:09.840
Should we find out?

23:09.870 --> 23:11.590
No,probably not.

23:11.620 --> 23:12.750
I trust her.

23:12.780 --> 23:13.840
Really?

23:13.870 --> 23:16.100
Well,not completely,

23:16.140 --> 23:19.500
but I don't think she'll
get into any trouble. Ever.

23:19.530 --> 23:20.920
Not after what I did.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.530
I kind of ruined her life too.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.840
You didn't ruin her life.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.380
Or yours.

23:27.430 --> 23:29.410
Your life's just gonna be different.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.930
And so is hers and so
is mine and-- And your dad's,

23:31.960 --> 23:34.550
but not ruined.

23:34.590 --> 23:36.650
Don't do that to yourself.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.700
Or the baby.

23:38.740 --> 23:41.400
Life's just a big adventure.

23:41.440 --> 23:44.580
And yours is a really big
adventure right now.

23:44.630 --> 23:46.630
But that's okay.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.710
Everything's gonna be fine.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.590
I think it's a girl.

23:53.630 --> 23:54.850
You do?

23:54.880 --> 23:57.590
Well,I think I want
the baby to be a girl.

23:57.630 --> 23:58.870
Why's that?

23:58.900 --> 24:01.950
Bob abused Ricky and Ricky's a boy so--

24:01.980 --> 24:03.310
So maybe if the baby's a girl

24:03.340 --> 24:05.540
and Bob and Ricky are here
then they wouldn't touch her.

24:05.580 --> 24:07.520
Oh,honey,it doesn't work that way.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.910
So even if the baby's a girl--?

24:08.950 --> 24:11.010
Let's just hope that whether
it's a boy or a girl

24:11.050 --> 24:13.300
that no harm comes to it.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.620
And anyway,maybe Ricky
can break the cycle of abuse.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.500
Well,Ricky's father
was probably abused

24:19.530 --> 24:21.790
and his father's father but...

24:21.820 --> 24:24.320
But anyway,maybe Ricky
will agree to the adoption.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.340
Maybe he'll just wanna stay
away from the baby.

24:26.370 --> 24:28.440
Maybe we should both stay away.

24:28.490 --> 24:31.480
Maybe we should just let
the parents be parents

24:31.510 --> 24:33.590
and do what's best for the baby.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.570
I don't think I want to know,Mom.

24:35.620 --> 24:36.620
Not right now,anyway.

24:36.660 --> 24:37.710
It's okay.

24:37.750 --> 24:40.120
A lot of people don't wanna
know the sex of the baby,

24:40.170 --> 24:41.790
for various reasons.

24:41.830 --> 24:43.750
Just make sure that you
tell the doctor that.

24:43.790 --> 24:46.080
And I think I want
to do this alone.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.770
Oh,okay.

24:50.770 --> 24:52.970
Whatever you feel comfortable with.

24:53.010 --> 24:55.610
But I'm there if...

25:12.350 --> 25:13.345
Hey,Jack.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.480
That's Jesus.

25:15.530 --> 25:16.680
Oh,is it?

25:16.710 --> 25:17.390
Is it a photograph?

25:17.430 --> 25:20.120
I thought it was some
painting by some Caucasian

25:20.170 --> 25:23.450
who wanted to see the son of
God as light-skinned with blue eyes.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.480
Yeah,you're right.

25:25.530 --> 25:28.150
He kind of looks like me,
don't you think?

25:29.390 --> 25:32.220
Or you look like him,
depending on the ego.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.640
You waiting to see my dad?

25:33.670 --> 25:36.170
I am,but some crabby old woman
in support stockings

25:36.230 --> 25:38.770
told me that he's stuck
in traffic on the freeway.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.740
That's the church secretary.

25:40.780 --> 25:42.420
Stuck in traffic,huh?

25:42.450 --> 25:44.620
I needed to see him too.

25:44.660 --> 25:46.620
You know,I can't
wait around,can you?

25:46.660 --> 25:48.020
You want a ride home?

25:48.050 --> 25:49.870
No,I think I'll wait.

25:49.910 --> 25:51.200
Must be important.

25:51.220 --> 25:53.060
Yes,it is.

25:54.730 --> 25:55.810
Well,if you must know,

25:55.860 --> 25:57.780
I wanted him to stop my
parents from getting divorced

25:57.830 --> 26:00.560
and now something else
has become a priority.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.820
Okay,Ricky's dad got out of prison

26:04.860 --> 26:08.400
and he showed up at our house
in his lime green muscle car.

26:08.450 --> 26:10.680
I just don't want anything
to happen to Amy,

26:10.730 --> 26:12.380
the baby or even Ricky.

26:12.420 --> 26:15.511
So I just thought he might
have a hotline to,you know,

26:15.940 --> 26:18.730
that guy,or know
a judge or something.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.150
A lime green muscle car?

26:21.190 --> 26:22.710
What was he in prison for? Car theft?

26:22.740 --> 26:25.860
I don't know but it's very
important that he go back to prison.

26:27.340 --> 26:30.220
Okay,it was for abusing children,
but that's all I can say.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.590
I don't know if my dad can help
you with something like that.

26:33.630 --> 26:35.440
Yeah,I just thought I'd ask.

26:35.490 --> 26:37.350
Because,you know,I'm just--

26:37.390 --> 26:40.080
I'm just scared my dad is
gonna do something stupid.

26:40.630 --> 26:43.822
All right,some kid over in
gangland is waiting for me

26:43.857 --> 26:45.970
to show up to mentor
him into success,

26:46.010 --> 26:47.580
so,uh,I better get going.

26:47.630 --> 26:48.920
Good luck with that.

26:48.950 --> 26:50.690
Good luck with my dad.

27:02.340 --> 27:04.610
You know,my ex-husband
looked a lot like that.

27:04.650 --> 27:06.050
Think that's why I married him.

27:06.090 --> 27:07.850
I thought he was that good.

27:07.870 --> 27:09.370
Turns out he's not.

27:09.400 --> 27:13.040
You know,um,Reverend Stone
isn't here. He's stuck in traffic.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.950
That guy is always stuck
in traffic. He drives like a turtle.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.830
Will you tell him that
Veronica stopped by to see him?

27:18.870 --> 27:20.660
Don't know if
I'll see him,but okay.

27:20.690 --> 27:21.800
I can't wait around.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.200
I'm a cocktail waitress
over at Kevin Ryan's

27:24.240 --> 27:27.170
and we're short on help this
week and I need the tips.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.230
Can't get my ex-husband
to cough up the child support.

27:30.260 --> 27:32.810
Rev. Stone was supposed
to help me with that.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.220
So are you hiring?

27:35.270 --> 27:36.460
Are you looking?

27:36.500 --> 27:37.980
Well,I am looking for a job.

27:38.030 --> 27:40.300
But I don't know if I'd be
too hot at cocktails.

27:40.330 --> 27:43.700
I mean,I'm not really
a people person and I don't drink.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.890
That's perfect. Are you over 21?

27:45.930 --> 27:47.390
What,you wanna see my ID?

27:47.430 --> 27:49.820
No. I'll-- I'll get you in.
Come on,let's go.

27:53.980 --> 27:55.540
Goodbye.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.780
Hey,kiddo.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.340
Oh,right.Restraining order.

28:07.380 --> 28:10.180
Probably shouldn't be this
close to a school either.

28:10.220 --> 28:12.340
But I wanted to ask you something.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.420
Girl or boy?

28:15.450 --> 28:18.800
The baby.
Is it a girl or is it a boy?

28:18.840 --> 28:20.100
Because I got a line on
a couple

28:20.135 --> 28:23.230
who would pay 100 grand
for a healthy white male infant.

28:23.270 --> 28:24.840
So I'm hoping it's a boy.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.580
I bet you do.

28:27.630 --> 28:29.630
Look,I'm under no misconceptions here.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.670
I know I'm not getting your
vote for father of the year.

28:33.550 --> 28:36.160
But that's all water under
the bridge as far as I'm concerned.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.040
I can't change the past.

28:38.070 --> 28:40.650
You want me to go away,
I want to go away,

28:40.680 --> 28:41.800
but I can't.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.730
I don't have the funds.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.740
So think of it as a finder's fee.

28:47.520 --> 28:51.030
You give me what I want,
I'll get out of your life.

28:51.070 --> 28:53.140
It's the only way
I can get out of your life.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.430
Can't get out of your
life without the money.

28:55.470 --> 28:58.180
And keep me posted on whether
it's a boy or a girl.

28:58.630 --> 29:01.500
I think Amy has her
doctor's appointment today.

29:02.690 --> 29:04.220
See you.

29:40.750 --> 29:42.460
Adrian,I'll have to call you back.

29:42.490 --> 29:43.650
He was there,Dad.

29:43.690 --> 29:46.660
He was there in the parking
lot at school.Ricky called me.

29:46.690 --> 29:48.290
Honey,I'll call you back.

29:48.340 --> 29:50.360
No,talk to me. Do something.

29:50.410 --> 29:51.990
Five minutes.

29:54.800 --> 29:55.650
I heard that.

29:55.680 --> 29:56.950
Well,then you know I'm working on it.

29:56.990 --> 29:59.100
You're not working on it fast enough.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.340
I'm working on it.

30:00.390 --> 30:01.700
There has to be something you can do.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.510
I want something done right now.

30:03.550 --> 30:04.640
I understand that.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.250
And I sympathize.

30:06.300 --> 30:09.170
But sometimes we just have to
let the situation play itself out.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.750
And if someone gets
hurt in the process?

30:10.790 --> 30:12.080
We can't arrest a man for no reason.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.920
The man abused his own son.

30:14.630 --> 30:16.320
And he went to prison for that.

30:16.350 --> 30:18.670
Look,how frustrating
do you think it is

30:18.710 --> 30:20.490
for all of us in law enforcement?

30:20.530 --> 30:21.860
We work hard to send
these guys away

30:21.900 --> 30:23.500
and then the prisons
can't hold them all.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.530
They just get turned out again and
then we have to go after them again,

30:26.570 --> 30:30.290
while we also go after all the other
guys out there who are yet to be caught.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.160
But I do my job.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.090
I'm trying to do my job anyway.

30:35.110 --> 30:36.760
Well,you better do your job as a father too,

30:36.800 --> 30:39.760
and keep that Ricky away
from Adrian. She's a nice girl.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.090
I know she's a nice girl.

30:42.130 --> 30:44.300
And so is her mother.

31:08.220 --> 31:10.060
We're here,okay?

31:17.050 --> 31:18.460
Jack Pappas?

31:18.500 --> 31:19.640
Yeah.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.300
Are you Duncan's,uh...?

31:21.340 --> 31:22.560
His...

31:22.610 --> 31:23.650
Mother.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.010
Are you?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.880
No,I'm his sister.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.490
I'm Shawna.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.340
Duncan! Jack's here!

31:34.280 --> 31:35.450
You don't look like the kind of guy

31:35.490 --> 31:37.360
who would get in trouble for fake IDs.

31:37.410 --> 31:38.600
They told you that?

31:38.660 --> 31:40.290
Yeah.

31:40.340 --> 31:43.170
They also told me you probably
had nothing to do with it.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.780
Oh,I had something to do with it.

31:45.100 --> 31:48.230
Either way,um,thanks,Jack.

31:48.260 --> 31:50.950
Duncan's not allowed to have
friends in the neighborhood

31:50.990 --> 31:53.090
and he needs to get
out once in a while.

31:53.150 --> 31:54.610
It's no problem.

31:55.090 --> 31:57.010
Duncan!

31:59.590 --> 32:01.130
Sorry,I was on the phone.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.720
Hey,Jack. Hey.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.750
You was expecting someone
about this high,huh?

32:05.800 --> 32:07.740
Well,kind of,yeah.

32:07.800 --> 32:08.660
You still wanna do this?

32:08.710 --> 32:10.220
Yeah. Let's roll.

32:10.270 --> 32:12.210
See you in a sec.

32:30.140 --> 32:31.920
Hey,man.You don't wanna do that.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.200
I don't wanna do what?

32:34.235 --> 32:37.410
Look,don't mad dog the dealer.
Just drive away.

32:39.020 --> 32:40.520
Dude.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.310
Don't be stupid.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.090
I gotta make a phone call.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.240
No,no,no,no,no,not with me in the car.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.730
Look,you drive out the neighborhood
before you make any phone calls.

32:50.750 --> 32:53.790
Better yet,mind your
own business.All right?

32:54.950 --> 32:56.650
Now,let's ride.

33:01.820 --> 33:03.690
Hey,so how'd it go?

33:03.730 --> 33:05.290
I didn't go.

33:05.340 --> 33:06.810
Good.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.020
She didn't let me.

33:08.060 --> 33:09.130
Good.

33:09.170 --> 33:11.200
She doesn't want me
there for the birth.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.180
That's good too.

33:13.210 --> 33:15.150
This isn't funny,you know?

33:15.190 --> 33:16.980
I'm trying to be a man

33:17.010 --> 33:18.670
but it's hard when
people won't let you.

33:18.710 --> 33:20.480
Lots of ways of being a man,son.

33:20.530 --> 33:22.220
Every book that
I've read has said that

33:22.260 --> 33:24.910
the husband,father,partner,whatever

33:24.950 --> 33:26.360
should be there for all these things.

33:26.410 --> 33:28.680
Well,that's when the husband,
father,partner,whatever

33:28.730 --> 33:31.100
is intimate with the woman
who's giving birth.

33:31.150 --> 33:33.500
As far as I know you're not
intimate with Amy.

33:33.540 --> 33:34.650
I hope.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.790
Look,she's a 15-year-old
girl having a baby.

33:37.830 --> 33:39.830
You're a 15-year-old guy.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.220
You're not a married couple.

33:41.260 --> 33:43.040
You haven't seen each other naked.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.650
You haven't made love to each other.

33:44.700 --> 33:47.130
You haven't been with
each other for years.

33:47.180 --> 33:48.600
You're just getting to know each other.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.720
And it's just not appropriate for
you to participate in certain things.

33:51.780 --> 33:52.900
What certain things?

33:52.950 --> 33:56.270
Certain things like anything that
may make your Amy feel uncomfortable.

33:56.310 --> 33:57.240
I'll tell you what,

33:57.280 --> 33:59.650
next time you go to doctor's
office for a checkup,

33:59.690 --> 34:01.790
ask Amy if she wants
to go with you.

34:05.770 --> 34:06.630
Hello.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.659
Leo. It's George Juergens.

34:08.699 --> 34:10.190
What are you doing for dinner?

34:10.230 --> 34:11.969
I don't know,George.
What are you doing?

34:12.020 --> 34:15.040
You feel like grabbing a steak?
Have some drinks?

34:15.080 --> 34:16.370
You got plans for dinner?

34:16.420 --> 34:18.650
I'm just gonna wait for Amy to call.

34:18.710 --> 34:21.270
Okay,well,you can
do that on your own.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.030
You're on,George.

34:26.449 --> 34:27.760
What the heck are you doing?

34:27.800 --> 34:32.090
Um,I'm just,uh,looking
for some loose change.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.480
All right,well,get back out there.
You're doing great,kid.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.739
Yeah,we might have a...

34:36.780 --> 34:39.760
tiny... tad little problem.

34:46.239 --> 34:48.800
Amy,I'm so sorry. I got tied up
with a difficult delivery.

34:48.850 --> 34:50.710
But mother and baby are just fine.

34:50.750 --> 34:51.980
Sorry to keep you waiting.

34:52.010 --> 34:54.960
They told me I could go home but
I just want to get it over with.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.290
Get it over with? This isn't
an "over with" kind of visit.

34:57.330 --> 34:58.380
This is easy.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.750
This might be your favorite
visit ever,in fact.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.500
Just so you know,um,

35:02.540 --> 35:05.240
Amy might not wanna know
what she's having.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.700
If it's a boy or a girl.

35:06.740 --> 35:09.900
Oh. Okay,well,come on back
and we'll talk about it.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.320
Okay.

35:26.110 --> 35:27.670
Why would you get a job?

35:27.710 --> 35:29.410
Just trying to do my part.

35:29.470 --> 35:30.800
Your part in what?

35:30.830 --> 35:32.360
I don't know,supporting the baby?

35:32.400 --> 35:34.650
Oh,Ashley. You don't have
to support the baby.

35:34.690 --> 35:37.630
Your mother's just trying to teach
Amy a lesson about being responsible.

35:37.670 --> 35:40.380
Now,she's gonna be so responsible
she'll probably have the baby adopted.

35:40.420 --> 35:43.060
I know,I just don't
really want that to happen.

35:43.110 --> 35:45.820
So I was just trying to earn
some extra cash,you know?

35:45.860 --> 35:47.550
Yeah,I know. But you're underage.

35:47.590 --> 35:49.230
You could have
this business shut down.

35:49.890 --> 35:52.210
I-- I didn't realize that.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.330
You know,I've only been
here a couple hours

35:54.360 --> 35:56.230
and I've already made
a hundred in tips.

35:56.270 --> 35:57.340
Really?

35:57.370 --> 36:00.230
Well,you can't earn money
because you don't have a work permit.

36:00.260 --> 36:03.490
So you're gonna have to pass
those tips along to Veronica.

36:03.530 --> 36:04.060
Really?

36:04.110 --> 36:05.160
Well,I don't know what to do here.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.760
I don't want anyone to get in trouble.

36:06.810 --> 36:08.110
Here,just take it.

36:08.150 --> 36:11.010
Oh,well,I-- I can't just...

36:11.040 --> 36:12.700
Wow. Thank you.

36:12.730 --> 36:14.280
You know,I should give
you something in return.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.810
How about a free dinner?

36:15.850 --> 36:18.660
Then I'd have to tell my boss
and then I could lose my job...

36:18.710 --> 36:20.460
I can't afford to lose
my job right now,so...

36:20.510 --> 36:22.100
Hey,George. Ashley.

36:22.150 --> 36:23.820
Hey. Good to see you.

36:23.870 --> 36:25.670
I didn't expect to
see my daughter here.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.640
She used her fake ID to get a job.

36:27.690 --> 36:29.570
Well,at least it went to good use.

36:29.630 --> 36:31.290
How about a steak?

36:31.340 --> 36:33.280
Oh,I called her mother
to come and get her.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.650
She should be here in a bit.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.360
Well,in the meantime,

36:36.400 --> 36:38.180
can I get you two gentlemen a drink?

36:39.540 --> 36:40.860
Joking.

36:51.260 --> 36:52.510
What's going on?

36:52.560 --> 36:54.070
I want to talk to you,Ricky.

36:54.110 --> 36:56.950
Okay,I know I hurt Grace's
feelings and I'm sorry.

36:56.980 --> 36:57.880
I can't help it.

36:57.930 --> 37:00.500
You can't help a lot
of things,Ricky. Sit down.

37:07.490 --> 37:10.610
You can't help it if your
father is a sick man.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.950
You can't help it if he
did horrible things to you.

37:12.990 --> 37:14.710
You can't. It's not your fault.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.050
You didn't ask for it.
You would never ask for it.

37:17.090 --> 37:18.430
You never wanted it to happen,Ricky.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.050
But I imagine sometimes you doubt that.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.860
So you keep going to therapy.

37:23.900 --> 37:24.900
You work at it every day.

37:24.940 --> 37:25.863
And then you realize 

37:25.863 --> 37:28.440
that sometimes you're just 
like every other guy.

37:28.490 --> 37:29.820
You wanna have sex
because you're attracted

37:29.870 --> 37:31.520
to some woman and you love her.

37:31.550 --> 37:34.410
Then you realize that sometimes
you want to have sex

37:34.450 --> 37:37.800
because your father violated
you and you want to act out.

37:37.830 --> 37:40.490
You want to abuse
somebody else, anybody else,

37:40.530 --> 37:41.810
any other woman,any other girl

37:41.840 --> 37:45.440
that you can convince
to have sex with you.

37:45.480 --> 37:46.980
But you don't do that,Ricky.

37:47.030 --> 37:49.640
Because you know that
if you did do that,

37:49.680 --> 37:51.255
you would just be doing to somebody else 

37:51.255 --> 37:55.210
what your father did to you.
Till you learn to love yourself,

37:55.250 --> 37:56.790
because you're a good person.

37:56.830 --> 37:59.300
Ricky,deep down inside,

37:59.350 --> 38:01.550
you are a good person.

38:02.420 --> 38:05.110
What happened to you
was not your fault,

38:05.150 --> 38:08.040
but what you choose to do to other
people, that's your responsibility.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.630
Son,you have it within yourself

38:11.680 --> 38:14.400
to change yourself

38:14.460 --> 38:17.270
and to stop the cycle.
You can stop the cycle.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.410
I believe that. I believe in you.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.139
Now,that's not to say that

38:20.139 --> 38:22.440
I'm not a little nervous
with you hanging around my daughter,

38:22.470 --> 38:28.640
but I believe that you can stop
the cycle of violence in your family

38:28.680 --> 38:30.410
if you make the decision to do that.

38:30.450 --> 38:32.770
What makes you think you know
anything about this?

38:32.810 --> 38:36.250
What makes you think you know
anything about my life?

38:36.290 --> 38:38.050
Is this something you
learned in med school?

38:38.090 --> 38:40.200
Something you read in a book?

38:40.680 --> 38:42.870
No offense,but I don't think
you know anything about it.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.770
No offense,but I know
everything about it,Ricky.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.680
I know everything about this.

38:48.790 --> 38:50.990
You see,my brother was
a big baseball fan

38:51.040 --> 38:53.580
and our next-door neighbor somehow
always had extra tickets.

38:53.620 --> 38:56.360
Well,our next-door neighbor was
sexually abusing my brother

38:56.420 --> 38:59.080
and one day he killed himself.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.140
How'd you find out
about the neighbor?

39:05.180 --> 39:07.550
On the suicide note.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.390
That was the first time any of
us knew anything about it.

39:10.430 --> 39:12.730
You see,my brother was afraid
that if we knew about it,

39:12.780 --> 39:14.840
we wouldn't love him anymore.

39:19.260 --> 39:22.920
So that is why I am glad

39:22.960 --> 39:25.330
that you have chosen
to talk to somebody.

39:25.370 --> 39:29.460
And if you ever need to talk to
anybody about this,you can talk to me.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.710
You can talk to Grace.

39:31.740 --> 39:34.640
No judgment ever.

39:34.690 --> 39:35.970
I promise.

39:36.020 --> 39:38.920
Even though you know about me,
you'd still let me go out with Grace?

39:38.970 --> 39:40.780
Yeah.

39:40.820 --> 39:42.750
I would.

39:43.870 --> 39:46.360
You just don't do anything stupid.

39:48.890 --> 39:51.470
So you don't know anyone who could
even scare the guy a little bit?

39:51.510 --> 39:53.000
Nope.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.430
I just want someone to sneak
up behind him in a dark alley

39:55.470 --> 39:57.050
and beat the stuffing out of him.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.170
- I don't know anyone.
- No one?

39:59.220 --> 40:01.990
Nope. And even if I did,
that's not the answer.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.750
Well,come on,we have to do something.

40:03.790 --> 40:07.130
Unfortunately,George,we have to wait
for the authorities to do something,

40:07.180 --> 40:09.880
you know,otherwise we're
just criminals, just like he is.

40:09.930 --> 40:11.740
We're not criminals
who abuse our children.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.850
No,we're not.
We're not criminals,period.

40:13.890 --> 40:16.470
We've got our children
to think about,Ben and Amy.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.450
I mean,the kid wants to be in the
room with her when she gives birth.

40:19.490 --> 40:21.440
Oh,no,I-- I-- I don't think so.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.720
No,I don't either.

40:22.770 --> 40:25.120
He's sitting around
the house pouting about it.

40:25.180 --> 40:27.490
I just hope he comes
to his senses and realizes

40:27.550 --> 40:29.990
there's only so much he can do.

40:37.620 --> 40:39.330
Everything okay?

40:44.250 --> 40:46.090
Yeah.

40:49.950 --> 40:51.790
Well,I'll be darned.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.250
Oh,hey,hold it down a little bit,
I'm getting a glare.

40:57.270 --> 40:59.120
Yeah,that's good.

41:04.220 --> 41:06.120
I'm Amy.

41:06.150 --> 41:07.810
I'm your mother.

41:07.860 --> 41:09.990
Your birth mother.

41:10.030 --> 41:13.090
And,uh,this is your grandmother,

41:13.140 --> 41:16.530
the mother of your birth
mother,my mother.

41:19.730 --> 41:22.720
She was with me when we got
to see you on the sonogram.

41:29.050 --> 41:32.640
And,uh,we love you.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.750
I love you and--

41:34.790 --> 41:36.570
And my mother loves you.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.070
My boyfriend and
someday-husband,Ben,

41:39.110 --> 41:40.510
he loves you.

41:40.550 --> 41:42.880
He's making this for you right now.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.820
My dad loves you

41:44.850 --> 41:47.030
and my sister loves you

41:47.070 --> 41:49.800
and my whole family loves you.

41:49.850 --> 41:52.670
And all my friends love you.

41:52.710 --> 41:56.700
And that's why we wanna make sure
that you have the best home possible,

41:56.730 --> 41:59.470
with the best family possible.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.880
And,uh...

42:02.920 --> 42:07.040
I'm gonna do whatever I have to do
to make sure that happens for you.

42:07.090 --> 42:10.640
To make sure that you get all
that life has to offer.

42:11.510 --> 42:14.390
Because that's what
my parents did for me.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.750
And because...

42:18.790 --> 42:21.600
well...

42:23.710 --> 42:24.936
you're my son.

42:31.290 --> 42:32.756
*it's a boy*

42:37.490 --> 42:38.860
I've been calling you.

42:38.900 --> 42:40.570
I know. I had a visitor.

42:40.610 --> 42:41.950
Did you check your messages?

42:42.000 --> 42:42.520
No.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.760
You didn't check your messages?

42:43.800 --> 42:45.510
No.

42:46.470 --> 42:50.400
They got him. Your father.
He's been arrested.

42:50.430 --> 42:51.490
For?

42:51.520 --> 42:53.970
A possession of drugs.
Jack saw him buying drugs.

42:54.010 --> 42:56.850
He called me,I called my dad.

42:57.660 --> 42:59.530
They got him.
