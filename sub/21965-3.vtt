00:01.041 --> 00:03.041
(  mellow theme playing  )

00:06.083 --> 00:08.291
CHASE:

00:06.083 --> 00:08.291
Policing the dock area.

00:08.333 --> 00:10.125
An excellent opportunity

00:08.333 --> 00:10.125
to explore

00:10.166 --> 00:11.750
the intricacies of

00:10.166 --> 00:11.750
maritime law.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.000
( sniffle )

00:13.041 --> 00:14.875
Not today, Chase.

00:14.917 --> 00:17.041
We're just here to escort a

00:14.917 --> 00:17.041
shipment from the government

00:17.083 --> 00:18.750
over to Doc's la-- La--

00:18.792 --> 00:20.750
Achoo! Lab.

00:26.625 --> 00:29.333
Score, bro.

00:26.625 --> 00:29.333
New tech for the taking.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.333
How about a little

00:29.375 --> 00:31.333
sound wave distraction?

00:31.375 --> 00:33.291
Heh, heh,

00:31.375 --> 00:33.291
yeah.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.333
(  mellow theme turns

00:33.333 --> 00:35.333
suspenseful  )

00:36.750 --> 00:39.250
( screams )

00:39.291 --> 00:40.917
( coughing )

00:40.959 --> 00:42.875
Help!

00:40.959 --> 00:42.875
Hang on, Mr. Bunty!

00:47.834 --> 00:49.291
CHASE:

00:47.834 --> 00:49.291
Cease and desist your larceny!

00:49.333 --> 00:50.792
( engine revs, tires squeal )

00:58.000 --> 01:01.834
( grunts, sneezes )

01:01.875 --> 01:03.208
( siren blaring )

01:11.125 --> 01:14.166
Chief, you seem to be

01:11.125 --> 01:14.166
experiencing fluid leakage.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.625
( sniffles ):

01:14.208 --> 01:15.625
Nothing to worry about.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.250
I've just caught

01:15.667 --> 01:17.250
a little bug.

01:18.166 --> 01:20.208
( Chief sneezes )

01:20.250 --> 01:22.709
( sighs ):

01:20.250 --> 01:22.709
Shall I roll down my window

01:20.250 --> 01:22.709
so you may release it?

01:24.542 --> 01:26.542
That cop car's running

01:24.542 --> 01:26.542
a little sluggish.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.709
Bet it needs oil.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.000

Nice drive--

02:28.709 --> 02:30.083
( sneezes )

02:30.125 --> 02:31.834
I do not understand, Chief.

02:31.875 --> 02:34.667
Perhaps if you could say it

02:31.875 --> 02:34.667
and not spray it?

02:34.709 --> 02:36.000
( sighs )

02:36.041 --> 02:38.500

are back on

We'd better--

02:44.583 --> 02:47.250
( sneezes )

02:47.291 --> 02:48.542
Get me home.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.709
DANI:

02:51.083 --> 02:52.709
Dad's sick with the flu.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.041
No rescues for him for awhile.

02:54.083 --> 02:58.125
Ooh,

02:54.083 --> 02:58.125
there is an upside.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.709
With Dad out of commission,

02:58.166 --> 03:00.709
the next oldest Burns,

03:00.750 --> 03:03.875
namely me, assumes command.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.125
Great.

03:05.166 --> 03:07.083
I second Cody's sarcasm.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.792
What does it mean

03:07.125 --> 03:09.792
to be "sick with the flu?"

03:09.834 --> 03:12.125
I got sick

03:09.834 --> 03:12.125
the first time I flew.

03:13.875 --> 03:17.083
Perhaps this handbook on human

03:13.875 --> 03:17.083
illness will enlighten us.

03:17.125 --> 03:21.375
Flu symptoms include exhaustion,

03:17.125 --> 03:21.375
fever and a running nose.

03:21.417 --> 03:23.000
( laughing )

03:23.041 --> 03:24.333
A running nose?

03:24.375 --> 03:27.166
They can't even walk.

03:24.375 --> 03:27.166
Can they?

03:27.208 --> 03:30.000
In other words, a sick

03:27.208 --> 03:30.000
human is less productive.

03:30.041 --> 03:32.875
On the contrary,

03:30.041 --> 03:32.875
Chief was quite productive.

03:32.917 --> 03:35.041
Of a substance known as mucus.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.208
I collected a sample

03:35.083 --> 03:37.208
if you would like to see.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.000
Eww! Humans.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.000
No thanks, Chase.

03:39.041 --> 03:40.959
What's wrong with you?

03:39.041 --> 03:40.959
I'll take a look.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.917
Attention, team! Got our first

03:41.000 --> 03:44.917
emergency with me in charge.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.709
Ruptured gas line

03:44.959 --> 03:46.709
downtown.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.959
Rescue Bots,

03:46.750 --> 03:49.959
roll to the rescue.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.250
Aww...

03:50.041 --> 03:52.250
I wanted to say that.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.959
Hi, Kade!

03:57.000 --> 03:59.417
I figured since Dad's out sick,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.417
I could ride with Chase.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.041
That way you'll have

03:59.458 --> 04:01.041
a full team and,

04:01.083 --> 04:02.709
Ha-ha-ha!

04:01.083 --> 04:02.709
Sorry squirt,

04:02.750 --> 04:05.792
but to ride on this rescue

04:02.750 --> 04:05.792
you need to be this tall.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.709
Ooh, too slow!

04:08.750 --> 04:10.875
Just because I'm not big

04:08.750 --> 04:10.875
doesn't mean I can't help!

04:10.917 --> 04:12.625
Actually, it does.

04:12.667 --> 04:15.250
A rescue like this

04:12.667 --> 04:15.250
takes size and strength.

04:15.291 --> 04:17.959
I tell you what,

04:15.291 --> 04:17.959
we'll arm-wrestle for it.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.208
Deal!

04:19.250 --> 04:21.250
Why are we wasting time

04:19.250 --> 04:21.250
with games?

04:21.291 --> 04:22.709
We have an emergency.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.750
Two seconds, Heat.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.750
Ready, set,

04:25.792 --> 04:27.000
( grunting )

04:27.041 --> 04:28.250
Oh, oh my gosh

04:27.041 --> 04:28.250
he's getting me.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.125
Oh, hi, oh!

04:28.291 --> 04:30.125
No, he's not.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.583
Ha, ha!

04:30.166 --> 04:31.583
You lose.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.250
( engine revs )

04:35.333 --> 04:37.333
( siren blaring )

04:39.166 --> 04:41.959
(  dramatic theme playing  )

04:42.000 --> 04:44.208
( Blades coughing )

04:44.250 --> 04:46.417
( siren blaring )

04:53.166 --> 04:55.333
All right listen up.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.333
Heatwave, you--

04:58.000 --> 05:00.333
put out those fires.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.333
Good.

05:00.375 --> 05:03.000
Chase,

05:00.375 --> 05:03.000
set up barricades.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.166
As per standard procedure.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.458
Graham and Boulder,

05:05.208 --> 05:07.458
you're on gas main repair.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.166
DANI:

05:07.500 --> 05:10.166
Kade, you don't

05:07.500 --> 05:10.166
have to try to be Dad.

05:10.208 --> 05:11.625
We know what we're doing.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.709
If that was true,

05:11.667 --> 05:13.709
you'd know

05:13.750 --> 05:16.709
I want a two-mile perimeter

05:13.750 --> 05:16.709
clear of pedestrians right now!

05:16.750 --> 05:19.750
Copy that, Captain Crankypants.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.834
Ha-ha-ha! Crankypants.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.834
Good one.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.125
( giggles )

05:27.166 --> 05:28.625
Gas fire. You need to--

05:28.667 --> 05:32.041
I know. Power up. And energize.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.333
So what's your assignment?

05:39.375 --> 05:41.250
Duh.

05:39.375 --> 05:41.250
I'm the leader.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.500
Cody!

05:47.542 --> 05:50.333
You're just in time to help us

05:47.542 --> 05:50.333
assemble the stasis machine!

05:50.375 --> 05:52.792
Or attempt to.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.792
Chief informed me

05:52.834 --> 05:55.250
that thieves absconded with

05:52.834 --> 05:55.250
part of the shipment.

05:55.291 --> 05:57.291
What's a stasis machine do?

05:57.333 --> 05:59.375
If it works right,

05:57.333 --> 05:59.375
nothing!

05:59.417 --> 06:03.041
Precisely! Stasis is

05:59.417 --> 06:03.041
the absence of activity.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.458
This device is designed

06:03.083 --> 06:05.458
to freeze an object

06:05.500 --> 06:07.583
in time and space.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.041
Like the pause button

06:07.625 --> 06:10.041
on a DVR!

06:10.083 --> 06:11.625
In a manner of speaking.

06:11.667 --> 06:15.458
Think of the stasis machine

06:11.667 --> 06:15.458
as a molecular refrigerator.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.500
Aging stops for objects

06:15.500 --> 06:18.500
exposed to its ray.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.542
Imagine the possibilities.

06:20.583 --> 06:21.875
With this technology,

06:21.917 --> 06:24.709
bananas could stay ripe

06:21.917 --> 06:24.709
for years and years!

06:24.750 --> 06:28.041
And someday, through

06:24.750 --> 06:28.041
the science of stasis,

06:28.083 --> 06:30.834
humans might

06:28.083 --> 06:30.834
no longer grow old!

06:30.875 --> 06:36.000
An extended lifetime of

06:30.875 --> 06:36.000
eating ancient bananas. Yum.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.917
There does seem to be

06:36.041 --> 06:37.917
a part missing.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.333
The remote is powered up.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.417
( screams )

06:44.458 --> 06:45.875
( Francine coughs )

06:45.917 --> 06:48.166
Cody, you all right?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.417
( Cody coughs )

06:49.458 --> 06:50.709
Uh, yeah, fine.

06:50.750 --> 06:52.166
I'm not so sure

06:50.750 --> 06:52.166
about that.

06:52.208 --> 06:54.333
Whoa, that machine

06:52.208 --> 06:54.333
shrunk you guys!

06:54.375 --> 06:56.125
On the contrary...

06:56.166 --> 07:00.083
You, uh, might want to...

07:04.667 --> 07:05.875
Fascinating!

07:05.917 --> 07:07.166
Weird.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.959
Noble.

07:11.041 --> 07:13.291
(  mellow rock theme playing  )

07:13.333 --> 07:17.709
Uh, Dad,

07:13.333 --> 07:17.709
that's not stasis.

07:17.750 --> 07:18.959
Quite right.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.250
It's only half of stasis.

07:21.291 --> 07:24.208
This machine appears

07:21.291 --> 07:24.208
to have two parts,

07:24.250 --> 07:27.333
one that ages,

07:24.250 --> 07:27.333
and one that reverses aging.

07:27.375 --> 07:30.500
When complete, these two forces

07:27.375 --> 07:30.500
balance each other.

07:30.542 --> 07:31.792
Creating stasis.

07:31.834 --> 07:34.250
So this is what I'll

07:31.834 --> 07:34.250
look like someday?

07:34.291 --> 07:36.959
How old do you think

07:34.291 --> 07:36.959
I am now, Doc, 25, 30?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.834
And how tall,

07:37.000 --> 07:38.834
like 6 feet?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.083
Ow!

07:40.125 --> 07:42.208
Closer to six-two.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.333
What do you think of

07:42.250 --> 07:44.333
my 'stache?

07:44.375 --> 07:47.333
Looks like

07:44.375 --> 07:47.333
a moldy caterpillar.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.458
Dad, you have

07:47.375 --> 07:49.458
to change him back.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.917
Would that I could,

07:49.500 --> 07:51.917
my young Tesla.

07:51.959 --> 07:54.875
I suspect the stolen piece

07:51.959 --> 07:54.875
of this machine

07:54.917 --> 07:57.458
could reverse

07:54.917 --> 07:57.458
Cody's, uh, growth spurt.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.542
So as long as

07:57.500 --> 08:00.542
the tech's missing,

08:00.583 --> 08:02.125
Cody's stuck

08:00.583 --> 08:02.125
like that?

08:02.166 --> 08:04.166
Is this awesome

08:02.166 --> 08:04.166
or what?

08:04.208 --> 08:05.709
( whimsical theme playing )

08:05.750 --> 08:09.083
Perhaps not. If I could

08:05.750 --> 08:09.083
invert the polarity...

08:09.125 --> 08:10.333
( Cody grunts )

08:10.375 --> 08:13.208
No hurry.

08:10.375 --> 08:13.208
Yes hurry!

08:13.250 --> 08:15.792
Oh, I can't wait

08:13.250 --> 08:15.792
for Kade to see me now!

08:15.834 --> 08:17.458
Being bigger rules!

08:19.667 --> 08:20.875
( sizzles )

08:19.667 --> 08:20.875
( grunts )

08:20.917 --> 08:22.208
( giggles )

08:22.250 --> 08:24.500
Gravity has a few rules

08:22.250 --> 08:24.500
of its own.

08:24.542 --> 08:26.750
This thing's for kids

08:24.542 --> 08:26.750
anyhow. See ya!

08:26.792 --> 08:28.792
(  mellow rock theme playing  )

08:29.709 --> 08:31.291
( sighs )

08:35.709 --> 08:37.709
(  mellow rock theme playing  )

08:40.000 --> 08:42.375
CHASE:

08:40.000 --> 08:42.375
Halt, interloper!

08:42.417 --> 08:45.083
Ha-ha! Relax, Chase,

08:42.417 --> 08:45.083
it's me, Cody!

08:46.750 --> 08:49.291
Identification confirmed.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.291
However, your appearance

08:49.333 --> 08:52.041
and tonal transmissions

08:49.333 --> 08:52.041
have changed drastically.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.458
Not to mention my bedtime.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.333
Cody?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.333
What happened?

08:56.375 --> 08:58.792
You have a lip warmer

08:56.375 --> 08:58.792
like Chief!

08:58.834 --> 09:01.041
I believe it is called

08:58.834 --> 09:01.041
a sneeze guard.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.041
Or, in some jargons,

09:01.083 --> 09:03.041
a crumb catcher.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.500
Was that inside your nose

09:03.083 --> 09:05.500
the whole time?

09:05.542 --> 09:08.208
Forget the mustache, guys!

09:05.542 --> 09:08.208
Look at me!

09:08.250 --> 09:10.709
Bigger, stronger.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.709
I've turned into an adult!

09:10.750 --> 09:14.208
Yeah, transform into a truck,

09:10.750 --> 09:14.208
then we'll talk.

09:14.250 --> 09:17.375
Come on. Haven't you Bots

09:14.250 --> 09:17.375
ever wished you were taller?

09:17.417 --> 09:20.208
I have enough difficulty

09:17.417 --> 09:20.208
with low overpasses as it is.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.166
Cody,

09:20.250 --> 09:22.166
when you're our size,

09:22.208 --> 09:24.917
a few extra human feet doesn't

09:22.208 --> 09:24.917
make much of a difference.

09:24.959 --> 09:27.959
It's more than height.

09:24.959 --> 09:27.959
Now I'm an official grown-up.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.417
Wait. Does this mean

09:28.000 --> 09:32.417
no more Lad Pioneers?

09:32.458 --> 09:35.542
No need. Adults get to have

09:32.458 --> 09:35.542
real adventures.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.458
Grown-up Cody...

09:39.500 --> 09:41.875
This could take

09:39.500 --> 09:41.875
some getting used to.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
( water running )

09:49.250 --> 09:50.750
CODY ( imitates high voice ):

09:49.250 --> 09:50.750
Guess who?

09:50.792 --> 09:52.166
Cody! Grow up.

09:52.208 --> 09:55.500
Um...he already did?

09:56.375 --> 09:57.750
Yeah, wha--?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.750
GRAHAM:

09:59.000 --> 10:00.750
Incredible!

10:00.792 --> 10:04.709
As long as it's temporary.

10:00.792 --> 10:04.709
It is temporary, right?

10:04.750 --> 10:07.583
Not sure. What--

10:04.750 --> 10:07.583
Hey!

10:07.625 --> 10:09.083
This is where

10:07.625 --> 10:09.083
you guys have been hiding

10:09.125 --> 10:10.500
the leftover

10:09.125 --> 10:10.500
Halloween candy?

10:10.542 --> 10:11.917
You look older

10:10.542 --> 10:11.917
than us!

10:11.959 --> 10:13.166
Ha! I know!

10:13.208 --> 10:14.417
( grunts )

10:14.458 --> 10:15.917
Ooh, too slow!

10:15.959 --> 10:18.750
Oh nice. You've gone from

10:15.959 --> 10:18.750
pipsqueak to pipfreak.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.208
I've gone from

10:18.792 --> 10:20.208
being smaller than you

10:20.250 --> 10:22.083
to being taller

10:20.250 --> 10:22.083
than you.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.625
( phone rings )

10:24.667 --> 10:25.917
Emergency dispatch.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.000
We're on our way.

10:28.041 --> 10:29.542
A rocket crashed

10:28.041 --> 10:29.542
downtown.

10:29.583 --> 10:32.125
Just another Saturday

10:29.583 --> 10:32.125
in Griffin Rock.

10:32.166 --> 10:35.625
Rescue Bots, get your tailpipes

10:32.166 --> 10:35.625
in gear. We have a situation.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.375
I'll ride

10:35.667 --> 10:37.375
with Chase.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.542
And you can't say

10:37.417 --> 10:39.542
I'm not big enough this time.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.125
( chuckles ):

10:39.583 --> 10:41.125
That was your rule, Kade.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.834
Technically,

10:41.166 --> 10:42.834
you could even argue that

10:42.875 --> 10:46.583
Cody appears to be the oldest,

10:42.875 --> 10:46.583
making him team leader.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.333
Tell you what.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.333
I'll arm wrestle you for it.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.250
Oh, real mature.

10:53.959 --> 10:56.000
( siren blaring )

10:56.041 --> 10:57.959
( classical music playing on

10:56.041 --> 10:57.959
radio )

10:58.000 --> 10:59.208
( rock music playing on radio)

10:59.250 --> 11:00.834
Chase, is this awesome

10:59.250 --> 11:00.834
or what?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.834
( loudly ):

11:00.875 --> 11:02.834
It is a new experience.

11:02.875 --> 11:06.458
Your selection of music is much

11:02.875 --> 11:06.458
more dissonant than Chief's.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.000
I fail to understand why

11:08.041 --> 11:11.125
increased body mass

11:08.041 --> 11:11.125
inspires such joy.

11:11.166 --> 11:13.417
You don't get it

11:11.166 --> 11:13.417
because you've never been small.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.750
Being big means you get

11:13.458 --> 11:15.750
to do more cool stuff!

11:15.792 --> 11:17.333
CHASE:

11:15.792 --> 11:17.333
Such as?

11:17.375 --> 11:19.542
CODY:

11:17.375 --> 11:19.542
Such as beating Kade

11:17.375 --> 11:19.542
to a mission!

11:19.583 --> 11:20.792
Uh, can I try parking?

11:20.834 --> 11:22.208
Certainly.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.750
First,

11:22.250 --> 11:23.750
check your blind spot, then--

11:23.792 --> 11:25.041
CODY:

11:23.792 --> 11:25.041
Whoa!

11:25.917 --> 11:27.250
( sighs )

11:27.291 --> 11:29.291
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:37.417 --> 11:38.917
Ha! What took you?

11:41.125 --> 11:43.125
KADE:

11:41.125 --> 11:43.125
That can't be

11:41.125 --> 11:43.125
government issue.

11:43.166 --> 11:46.542
It's a Mr. Cullen issue.

11:43.166 --> 11:46.542
Amateur astronomer.

11:46.583 --> 11:50.709
Looks like his

11:46.583 --> 11:50.709
latest launch...didn't.

11:50.750 --> 11:54.166
Those poles are about to give.

11:50.750 --> 11:54.166
We need to move the rocket now.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.750
There are 200 pounds of fuel

11:54.208 --> 11:56.750
in its tank.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.709
If we jostle the payload,

11:56.792 --> 11:59.709
it could ignite.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.375
An unchecked explosion that size

11:59.750 --> 12:02.375
could cause a lot of damage.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.166
Blades and I

12:02.417 --> 12:04.166
can snag the rocket

12:04.208 --> 12:06.917
with a grapple and carry it out

12:04.208 --> 12:06.917
to the ocean. Problem solved.

12:06.959 --> 12:10.041
Good. Dani, you go--

12:06.959 --> 12:10.041
No! It's tangled.

12:10.083 --> 12:13.041
CODY:

12:10.083 --> 12:13.041
If you pull on it, the power

12:10.083 --> 12:13.041
lines might spark and...boom!

12:13.083 --> 12:15.542
Do you have a better idea?

12:15.583 --> 12:18.208
Yes! First we shut off

12:15.583 --> 12:18.208
the juice to the lines,

12:18.250 --> 12:19.792
then we move the rocket.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.083
That's what I

12:19.834 --> 12:21.083
would suggest.

12:21.125 --> 12:22.792
Okay Cody.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.792
The power switch is located

12:22.834 --> 12:25.792
at the top of those poles.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.667
Heatwave, may I please

12:25.834 --> 12:29.667
use your ladder?

12:29.709 --> 12:31.458
Oh, now he's not only

12:29.709 --> 12:31.458
taking charge,

12:31.500 --> 12:33.417
he's ordering around

12:31.500 --> 12:33.417
my Bot?

12:33.458 --> 12:37.583
More like asking politely.

12:33.458 --> 12:37.583
You should try it sometime.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.375
I'll do it, Kade.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.208
I'm not sure you're tall

12:39.417 --> 12:41.208
enough to reach.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.500
( scoffs )

12:44.458 --> 12:47.000
( grunts )

12:47.041 --> 12:50.750
You may be a fireman, but

12:47.041 --> 12:50.750
I think you just got burned.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.208
( chuckles )

12:52.250 --> 12:54.667
( helicopter blades whirring )

12:54.709 --> 12:56.417
We're ready for you, Blades!

12:56.458 --> 12:59.750
No, we're ready. You're

12:56.458 --> 12:59.750
going to clear a perimeter,

12:59.792 --> 13:01.583
and get those lookie-loos

12:59.792 --> 13:01.583
a safe distance away.

13:01.625 --> 13:04.417
Yeah but I--

13:01.625 --> 13:04.417
You don't like the job, go home.

13:04.458 --> 13:05.917
( groans )

13:05.959 --> 13:07.959
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:12.625 --> 13:14.083
All right everyone,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.083
I need you to, um,

13:14.125 --> 13:15.834
step back for your safety,

13:15.875 --> 13:18.041
and you have to listen to me,

13:15.875 --> 13:18.041
because I'm an adult.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.041
Really.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.083
I've never seen you

13:21.083 --> 13:23.083
in town before!

13:23.125 --> 13:25.041
Are you part of the

13:23.125 --> 13:25.041
Burns family too?

13:25.083 --> 13:26.500
Hayley, it's me,

13:25.083 --> 13:26.500
Cod--

13:26.542 --> 13:29.583
(deep voice):

13:26.542 --> 13:29.583
Er, Cole, Kade's... cousin.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.500
Filling in for my Da--

13:29.625 --> 13:31.500
I mean, Chief,

13:31.542 --> 13:33.166
while he's

13:31.542 --> 13:33.166
out with the flu.

13:33.208 --> 13:34.917
Well it's nice of you

13:33.208 --> 13:34.917
to lend Kade a hand.

13:34.959 --> 13:36.250
Huh.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:37.542 --> 13:39.458
( both grunting )

13:43.375 --> 13:45.166
GRAHAM:

13:43.375 --> 13:45.166
Dani, hurry!

13:45.208 --> 13:47.709
The rocket's fuel tank is

13:45.208 --> 13:47.709
separating from the fuselage!

13:47.750 --> 13:48.959
( grunts )

13:49.000 --> 13:50.917
We're losing it!

13:50.959 --> 13:52.500
Incoming!

13:50.959 --> 13:52.500
Take cover!

13:53.208 --> 13:56.500
( clamoring )

13:56.542 --> 13:57.792

( helicopter blades whirring )

14:06.041 --> 14:07.250

14:07.291 --> 14:08.542
You saved my life.

( romantic theme playing )

14:09.834 --> 14:12.083
Eww...

14:09.834 --> 14:12.083
Hayley, are you--

14:12.125 --> 14:15.250
I'm fine, thanks to Cole.

14:15.291 --> 14:17.625
You never told me

14:15.291 --> 14:17.625
about your cousin, Kade.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.792
Where have you been

14:17.667 --> 14:19.792
hiding him?

14:19.834 --> 14:22.250
In much smaller clothes.

14:22.291 --> 14:23.750
Can I take you to lunch?

14:23.792 --> 14:25.875
I don't need anybody to take me.

14:23.792 --> 14:25.875
I can drive!

14:25.917 --> 14:27.125
( giggles )

14:27.166 --> 14:29.583
You're funny!

14:29.625 --> 14:30.959
( laughing ):

14:29.625 --> 14:30.959
I know, isn't he?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.291
Will you

14:31.000 --> 14:32.291
excuse us?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.709
Go home.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.875
You may look all grown up

14:35.750 --> 14:37.875
but you're still just a kid!

14:37.917 --> 14:39.500
You don't belong here!

14:39.542 --> 14:42.083
You're just mad 'cause you

14:39.542 --> 14:42.083
can't push me around anymore.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.333
Care to test that theory?

14:43.375 --> 14:45.125
( Chase clears throat )

14:45.166 --> 14:47.750
I am not certain Chief would

14:45.166 --> 14:47.750
condone this course of action.

14:47.792 --> 14:50.000
HEATWAVE:

14:47.792 --> 14:50.000
I'm all for power struggles,

14:50.041 --> 14:52.041
the task at hand.

14:52.083 --> 14:55.291
Come on, Chase.

14:52.083 --> 14:55.291
Kade can handle this without us.

14:55.333 --> 14:58.083
I kind of miss the old Cody.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.917
The young Cody.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.417
Hey, Frankie,

15:01.125 --> 15:03.417
wanna hang out?

15:03.458 --> 15:06.208
Uh, I can't.

15:03.458 --> 15:06.208
I'm still helping Dad.

15:06.250 --> 15:09.250
This is test banana number 17.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.458
( machine beeping wildly)

15:14.375 --> 15:17.125
I clearly need to

15:14.375 --> 15:17.125
re-calculate my data.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.375
You go, Frankie.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.375
Have fun.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.125
You're only young once.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.166
DOC GREENE:

15:22.166 --> 15:24.166
Uh, so to speak.

( grunts )

15:28.959 --> 15:30.166
( grunts )

15:30.208 --> 15:31.875
Denied! Whoo!

15:31.917 --> 15:33.542
( grunting )

15:33.583 --> 15:36.000
Ha, I'm creaming you.

15:36.041 --> 15:40.709
That's great. Look, I ought to

15:36.041 --> 15:40.709
go back and check on Dad.

15:40.750 --> 15:41.917
Thanks for coming over.

15:41.959 --> 15:43.417
See you later.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:45.917 --> 15:48.250
Excuse me.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.250
Shall I join you

15:48.291 --> 15:50.917
in your Toss the Orb

15:48.291 --> 15:50.917
Through the Ring contest?

15:50.959 --> 15:55.291
No, you're way bigger than me.

15:50.959 --> 15:55.291
Wouldn't be much fun...Hmm.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.917
Perhaps that is what Francine

15:55.333 --> 15:57.917
was feeling as well.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.166
( sighs ):

15:57.959 --> 15:59.166
Great.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.959
Kade thinks I'm a big kid,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.500
and Frankie doesn't want to

16:01.000 --> 16:03.500
hang out with a grown-up.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.375
I just want to go

16:04.709 --> 16:06.375
back to normal.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.417
(  dramatic theme swells  )

( engine dies down )

16:16.166 --> 16:17.750
( car doors close )

16:17.792 --> 16:20.333
Okay, check it out.

16:17.792 --> 16:20.333
We find a way in,

16:20.375 --> 16:23.417
nab the rest of that stasis

16:20.375 --> 16:23.417
machine, and we're golden.

16:23.458 --> 16:25.583
Cops can't catch you

16:23.458 --> 16:25.583
if they're frozen in place.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.917
Uh-huh.

16:26.959 --> 16:29.041
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

16:29.083 --> 16:31.000
Halt, perpetrators!

16:31.041 --> 16:34.709
Seriously? Do you not have

16:31.041 --> 16:34.709
a robot donut shop to be at?

16:35.875 --> 16:38.166
( grunts )

16:38.208 --> 16:40.583
MYLES:

16:38.208 --> 16:40.583
Looks like we found

16:38.208 --> 16:40.583
that way in!

16:50.250 --> 16:52.375
Ugh. Another Burns kid?

16:52.417 --> 16:54.041
How big is that family?

16:54.083 --> 16:56.917
Better question,

16:54.083 --> 16:56.917
how many friends do they have?

16:56.959 --> 16:58.500
Here, Trex!

16:56.959 --> 16:58.500
Intruders!

Come in, Rescue Team.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.834
Chase and I

17:16.208 --> 17:17.834
are tailing Evan and Myles.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.166
Request back-up.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.083
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

17:21.125 --> 17:23.625
Yeah, listen, "Cole,"

17:21.125 --> 17:23.625
I don't care what size you are.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.166
You're still a kid.

17:25.208 --> 17:26.959
You don't get to

17:25.208 --> 17:26.959
request anything.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.041
I'm chasing the thieves

17:27.000 --> 17:29.041
who have the machine

17:29.083 --> 17:30.417
that'll change me back

17:29.083 --> 17:30.417
to normal.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.000
On our way.

(  suspenseful theme playing  )

17:45.583 --> 17:47.125
Ha, ha!

17:45.583 --> 17:47.125
We ditched 'em, bro!

17:47.166 --> 17:49.792
( thudding )

17:49.834 --> 17:52.583
Are you familiar with the human

17:49.834 --> 17:52.583
known as Miranda?

BOTH: Ha-ha-ha!

18:01.041 --> 18:02.792
Yeah!

18:02.834 --> 18:06.375
Once we hijack the ferry to

18:02.834 --> 18:06.375
the mainland, we're home free!

18:07.250 --> 18:08.667

on foot.

18:23.625 --> 18:25.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:25.709 --> 18:27.750
Where's Kade? Is he hit?

18:25.709 --> 18:27.750
Is it bad?

18:27.792 --> 18:30.208
HEATWAVE:

18:27.792 --> 18:30.208
Yes. But somehow very fitting.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.709
( grunts )

18:31.750 --> 18:35.875
Go on, say something.

18:31.750 --> 18:35.875
You know you want to.

18:35.917 --> 18:37.875
I know how you feel,

18:35.917 --> 18:37.875
Kade.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.834
How am I supposed to

18:37.917 --> 18:40.834
explain this to Hayley?

18:42.333 --> 18:43.917
I thought you said

18:42.333 --> 18:43.917
she likes kids?

18:43.959 --> 18:45.375
Heatwave, Chase,

18:45.417 --> 18:48.208
Go around to

18:45.417 --> 18:48.208
the back of the warehouses.

18:48.250 --> 18:49.875
Kade and I will flush out

18:48.250 --> 18:49.875
Evan and Myles...

18:49.917 --> 18:52.000
You sure you want me along?

18:52.041 --> 18:53.709
So you lost some height.

You still have

18:53.750 --> 18:55.959
all your emergency response

more than me.

Ugh, 6-foot-2

Welcome aboard the

20:37.417 --> 20:40.500

I might act like a jerk

to you sometimes,

like a jerk to me is?
