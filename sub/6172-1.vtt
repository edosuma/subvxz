<i>It was summer,

03:22.286 --> 03:24.747
<i>After going door-to-door
all daylong,</i>

03:24.830 --> 03:27.374
<i>I was back again at Joppy's Bar,
tryin' to figure out...</i>

03:27.458 --> 03:30.377
<i>where I was gonna go lookin'
for work the next day.</i>

03:30.461 --> 03:34.506
<i>The newspapers was goin' on
and on about the city elections,</i>

03:34.590 --> 03:37.384
<i>like they was really
gonna change somebody's life.</i>

03:37.468 --> 03:41.722
<i>Well, my life had already changed when
I lost my job three weeks before.</i>

03:41.805 --> 03:46.477
For example, one of the white
guys pulls a double shift,

03:46.560 --> 03:50.564
says he's too tired to work
overtime, you don't fire them.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.816
That's all
you have to say?

04:02.243 --> 04:05.037
No, no, that's not all.
I-I need...

04:07.498 --> 04:11.418
I need to pay
my mortgage, and eat.

04:11.502 --> 04:15.839
I need a house to live in. I need to
put clothes on my back, Mr. Giacomo.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.718
- I need the job.
- I'm sorry, fella. I gotta get back to work.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.015
My name's not “fella.”

04:25.099 --> 04:27.017
Huh?

04:27.101 --> 04:31.105
My name's not “fella.”
My name is Ezekiel Rawlins.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.857
Catch you later, Joppy.

04:33.941 --> 04:37.361
Hey, watch the marble!
Damn it! What'd I tell you?

04:42.574 --> 04:45.869
Joppy, how much you think they're
payin' out there at Douglas Aircraft?

04:45.953 --> 04:49.540
I don't know. Don't it say
on the...

05:07.850 --> 05:12.980
Talk to him. Yes, sir.
You can talk to him.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.859
All right.
Easy, come on over here.

05:16.942 --> 05:19.945
I've got somebody
I want you to meet.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.244
Come on. This here's
a friend of mine.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.955
Yeah, Easy,
this is Mr. Albright.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.957
- You can call me Dewitt, Easy.
- How you doin'?

05:32.041 --> 05:35.586
- I'm all right.
- Take a seat, Easy.

05:38.005 --> 05:42.509
Mr. Albright and me
go way back to before the war.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.803
Matter of fact, when I was
still in the fight game.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.014
Mm-hmm.
Ever seen this guy fight?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.350
- No.
- No?

05:49.433 --> 05:52.895
Well, shoot. Every time Joppy
Shag stepped into the ring,

05:52.978 --> 05:57.483
you knew you was gonna see some real
knock-down-drag-out fisticuffs.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.902
- Where you from, Easy?
- Houston.

05:59.985 --> 06:03.781
Mmm, Houston.
That's Joppy's hometown.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.286
So, I hear
you need a job.

06:09.370 --> 06:13.165
Oh, yeah, uh, Easy's
always tryin' to do better.

06:13.248 --> 06:17.211
He's one of the few colored men
around here who owns his own house.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.881
He's payin' the mortgage every
month, just like y'all folks.

06:20.964 --> 06:25.886
Property owner, huh? These big companies
don't give a damn, do they, Easy?

06:25.969 --> 06:28.555
I got out of that racket
a long time ago.

06:28.639 --> 06:33.560
Look, if you do need a job, you drop
by this address... 7:00 tonight.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.438
What kind of work you do?

06:38.690 --> 06:42.277
I do favors.
I do favors for friends.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.531
Drop DY-

06:49.493 --> 06:51.412
Who was that,
Joppy?

06:51.495 --> 06:53.747
Just somebody I know.
Businessman.

06:53.831 --> 06:56.166
- Businessman, huh?
- Yeah, he is.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.170
Ain't nothin'
to worry about.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.424
<i>Now, when somebody
tell me ain't nothin' to worry about,</i>

07:03.507 --> 07:06.218
<i>I usually look down
to see if my fly is open.</i>

07:06.301 --> 07:11.265
<i>But all the way home all I could think
about was a chance to make some money.</i>

07:12.683 --> 07:14.309
<i>I first came out
to Los Angeles...</i>

07:14.393 --> 07:17.521
<i>when I got home
from the war in Europe...</i>

07:17.604 --> 07:20.315
<i>with $300 in my pocket
and the G.I. Bill.</i>

07:20.399 --> 07:23.735
- <i>Like me, a lot of colored folk from
Texas and Louisiana...</i> - Hi, Easy.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.946
<i>Had moved out to California
to get them good jobs...</i>

07:26.029 --> 07:30.701
- <i>...in the shipyards and in the
aircraft companies.</i> - Hey, Willy!

07:30.784 --> 07:33.495
<i>Now, me myself,
I was a machinist.</i>

07:33.579 --> 07:38.542
<i>And the first thing I did when I saved
enough money was to buy me a house.</i>

07:40.669 --> 07:43.464
<i>Man, I loved comin' home
to my house.</i>

07:43.547 --> 07:47.134
<i>I don't know. I guess maybe
I just loved ownin' somethin'.</i>

07:49.887 --> 07:52.097
How ya doin'?

07:57.227 --> 08:00.827
- Ezekiel, I'm gonna knock down some of them
trees in the back. - No, leave my trees alone.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.942
- I aint' gonna take but five...
- Get on!

08:26.590 --> 08:29.801
<i>I was feelin' pretty
desperate that evenin'.</i>

08:29.885 --> 08:32.804
<i>In a week I'd be two months
behind on my mortgage,</i>

08:32.888 --> 08:35.640
<i>and, no, sir, I wasn't
about to lose my house.</i>

08:35.724 --> 08:39.352
<i>But a chill runnin' up the back
of my neck was talkin' to me,</i>

08:39.436 --> 08:42.022
<i>tellin' me I was about to make
a bad decision.</i>

08:42.105 --> 08:44.358
<i>Yeah, Albright made me nervous.</i>

08:44.441 --> 08:47.528
<i>He reminded me of a fella I knew
back in Texas named Mouse.</i>

08:47.611 --> 08:50.572
Drive to the train yard, Easy.
Let's dump this damn thing...

08:50.656 --> 08:53.492
- What did you do, Mouse?
- Just drive this son of a bitch.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.619
<i>What did you do?</i>

09:19.309 --> 09:21.353
So...

09:23.355 --> 09:25.566
want the job?

09:25.649 --> 09:29.194
It depends“.on
what kind of job it is.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.572
I don't wanna get
mixed up in nothin'.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.199
Hmm. Walk out the door
in the morning, Easy,

09:34.283 --> 09:37.202
you're mixed up
in somethin'.

09:37.286 --> 09:41.415
Only thing that matters is if
you're mixed up to the top or not.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.543
I'm just lookin' for somebody.
For a friend.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.920
Daphne Monet.

09:47.004 --> 09:50.882
Fiancée of Todd Carter.
She been gone two weeks.

09:50.966 --> 09:55.137
It upset the poor man so much,
he stopped runnin' for mayor.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.765
I never laid eyes on her.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.767
That's a shame.

10:00.851 --> 10:04.438
See, Daphne has a predilection
for the company of Negroes.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.691
She likes jazz and pigs' feet
and dark meat.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.901
Know what I mean?

10:09.985 --> 10:11.695
Predilection, yeah.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.573
Yeah.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.618
I'd go lookin'
for her myself, but...

10:17.701 --> 10:21.163
I'm not of the right
persuasion, so to speak.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.958
- What do you want from me?
- What do you mean?

10:25.042 --> 10:27.377
What do you want me to do?

10:27.461 --> 10:30.380
Get a location on her.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.133
Mr. Carter wants
to make up with her.

10:33.216 --> 10:37.679
Hundred dollars.
I pay in advance.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.978
Hundred dollars.

10:45.062 --> 10:48.940
And all I got to do
is tell you where she's at?

10:49.024 --> 10:51.234
- That's right.
- And that's all?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.445
That's all.

10:53.528 --> 10:58.075
- You frequent an illegal club on
89th and Central. - Yeah, John's.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.994
Somebody saw Daphne there
a few nights ago.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.205
You could start tonight.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.755
Hmm.

11:17.719 --> 11:21.348

15:39.522 --> 15:42.525
Any of y'all seen a white girl
by the name of Dahlia...

15:42.609 --> 15:44.194
or Delilah,
somethin' like that?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.279
First name
start with a “D”?

15:46.363 --> 15:48.740
No.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.202
Coretta got a job
at the phone company.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.121
- That right?
- Yeah.

15:55.205 --> 15:58.458
Well, congratulations. They ain't
hirin' no mans down there, is they?

16:27.445 --> 16:29.781
You all right, Odell?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.336
He used to play
till the cock crowed.

16:43.420 --> 16:49.175
That old cock, it don't crow
nearly so much now.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.476
Ahh. I better
get on home.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.023
You'd be sorry if you go.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.276
I be sorry if I stay too.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.444
Good night, Coretta.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.534
Daphne sleep by now, so...

17:17.078 --> 17:19.414
you can't get
none of that tonight.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.544
Go around here
tellin' everybody “Dahlia.”

17:32.010 --> 17:33.887
Her name is Daphne.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.476
Do you know her?

17:55.158 --> 17:57.744
Where you want me
to put him at, baby?

17:57.827 --> 17:59.913
- This ain't my house!
- What?

17:59.996 --> 18:02.248
This ain't even my house.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.043
- Just throw him in there on the bed.
- Shut up, Negro.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.462
Where my keys?

18:07.545 --> 18:10.673
Careful of the door.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.052
Throwed him out of his
place 'cause he couldn't pay the rent.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.096
I shouldn't even let him
sleep here tonight.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.931
Damn, that Negro's heavy.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.766
I know. I know.

18:19.849 --> 18:25.063
I need a cigarette.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.273
That all you need?

18:29.025 --> 18:32.862
Girl, that sun catch
me tiptoein' out your door,

18:32.946 --> 18:34.786
ain't no tellin' what
your neighbors might say.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.076
All right, Easy.
All right.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.537
Dupree done
fell asleep on me,

18:40.620 --> 18:45.416
and you just gonna walk out
on me like I was dog food, huh?

18:45.500 --> 18:49.045
What? Girl,
what you talkin' about?

18:49.671 --> 18:51.297
Now, come on.

18:51.381 --> 18:55.301
Coretta, your man
is in the next room.

18:58.513 --> 19:01.224
Why don't you tell me
about your friend Daphne?

19:01.307 --> 19:05.812
Why do you keep askin'
about her? Hmm?

19:07.397 --> 19:10.984
Colored women ain't good enough
for you no more, huh, Easy?

19:11.067 --> 19:14.154
No, that ain't it.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.156
Look, I mean-

19:16.239 --> 19:18.283
Shoot.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.289
Well, what if he
was to hear somethin'?

19:25.582 --> 19:27.584
He asleep.

19:30.128 --> 19:35.425
Ohh! Baby, that's it!
Oh, yes!

19:35.508 --> 19:38.595
Oh, baby!
Oh, baby, that's it!

19:38.678 --> 19:43.016
Ohh! Ohh!
You're hittin' my spot!

19:43.099 --> 19:45.685
- Yeah, baby! Ohh!
- You're hittin' my spot!

19:48.354 --> 19:52.108
Easy, Easy, Easy.

19:52.192 --> 19:56.154
I can't give up that much lovin', daddy.
Not the way things is.

19:56.237 --> 19:59.574
- What things? - Come on now.
Dupree right in the next room.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.577
Forget about Dupree, baby.
You done got me goin', Coretta.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.872
It ain't right, Easy. Here I am
doin' this right in the next room.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.833
All you doin' is nosin'
after my friend Daphne.

20:08.917 --> 20:14.423
Daph... Oh, oh, oh. Oh, yeah.
No, baby. That's just a job.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.424
- What job?
- Some man want me to find her.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.551
- What man?
- I don't know what man, baby.

20:18.635 --> 20:23.806
I just, you know... I don't
want nobody but you“.baby.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.225
Yeah.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.898
Mmm. Ohhh!

20:31.981 --> 20:34.776
Daphne's my friend.
I can't do it.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.574
- Huh-uh.
- Shit.

20:47.205 --> 20:51.000
Just a little bit more, okay?
Just a <i>little</i> bit.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.878
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit, baby.

20:53.962 --> 20:56.673
Ohhh, just a little bit.

20:59.676 --> 21:02.262
Oh, that's it,
that's it, that's it.

21:02.345 --> 21:05.056
- Oh, you're hittin' my spot.
- Yeah, baby.

21:05.139 --> 21:08.101
Oh, you're hittin' my spot.

21:08.184 --> 21:12.021
- Ohh! Oh, that's it. That's it, daddy.
- Yeah, that's it.

21:12.105 --> 21:16.109
<i>Then I went on hittin' her
spot until just before sunup.</i>

21:18.528 --> 21:22.448
<i>I realized later on that Coretta had found
out as much about what I was up to...</i>

21:22.532 --> 21:25.118
<i>...as I had found out
about Daphne Monet.</i>

21:25.201 --> 21:29.455
<i>As it turned out, Todd Carter wasn't
the only man in Daphne's life.</i>

21:29.539 --> 21:33.418
<i>She was also shackin' up with some small-time
colored gangster named Frank Green,</i>

21:33.501 --> 21:37.297
<i>and Coretta had the nerve to charge
me $ 70 for that information.</i>

21:37.380 --> 21:39.966
<i>See, everybody was in business
in Los Angeles.</i>

21:42.343 --> 21:44.637
<i>I spent that morning
waiting for Albright to call...</i>

21:44.721 --> 21:47.807
<i>and trying to feel good about
being able to pay a few bills.</i>

21:47.890 --> 21:49.809
<i>And I mean just a few.</i>

21:49.892 --> 21:53.313
<i>Shoot, a loaf of bread
was damn near 75 cents.</i>

21:53.396 --> 21:55.982
<i>It was easy money.
Too easy.</i>

21:57.650 --> 22:00.820
- Bye, Easy.
- Hey, where you goin', Sophie?

22:00.903 --> 22:04.032
Back to Texas.
Too fast for me out here.

22:04.115 --> 22:06.409
- Bye, Mr. Rawlins!
- All right, then.

22:10.413 --> 22:14.292
Hey, get on away from them people's house!
Get away from that tree!

22:16.919 --> 22:19.672
Get on away
from that tree now!

22:19.756 --> 22:22.592
Go on.
Get away from that tree.

22:58.795 --> 23:02.131
Ricky! Come on, wash your hands.
It's time for supper.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.431
Ricky!

23:26.322 --> 23:29.158
- Hello?
- <i>Easy, how you doin', buddy?</i>

23:29.242 --> 23:32.120
- Who is this?
- <i>I hope you have good news for me.</i>

23:32.203 --> 23:34.414
Oh, Mr. Albright,
is that you?

23:34.497 --> 23:37.417
- <i>Sure is, Easy. What's shakin'?</i>
- I got what you want.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.087
<i>Why don't you hold onto that, Easy.
I only do business in person.</i>

23:41.170 --> 23:44.090
<i>Tell you what, real quick.
You come on out here to Malibu.</i>

23:44.173 --> 23:47.677
<i>Meet me at the Fisherman's Pier
hamburger stand in an hour. Okay?</i>

23:47.760 --> 23:50.763
Malibu? Look, Mr. Albright...

23:50.847 --> 23:53.766
Mr. Albright?

24:42.607 --> 24:44.567
Hi.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.998
It's pretty
out here, huh?

24:59.081 --> 25:01.167
Yeah, it's all right.

25:05.421 --> 25:10.218
I'm from Des Moines, Iowa.
Where are you from?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.138
Texas.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.434
Do they have
an ocean in Texas?

25:19.852 --> 25:22.480
- Hey, Barbara!
- Gulf. A gulf in Texas.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.482
Barbara, where are you?

25:24.565 --> 25:27.902
- I think your friends are lookin' for you.
- Who cares?

25:27.985 --> 25:31.531
My sister brought me here
because my parents made her.

25:31.614 --> 25:36.452
- Where is that girl? - All she wants to do
is make out with Herman and smoke cigarettes.

25:36.536 --> 25:40.373
Hey, there!
What are you doin' out here?

25:40.456 --> 25:44.377
- Hey, what's goin' on? - Leave us
alone, Herman. We're just talking.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.296
- We don't need you talkin' to her,
okay? - I said leave us alone.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.799
- We're just talkin' about the ocean.
- What's wrong?

25:49.882 --> 25:52.218
This nigger's tryin'
to pick up on Barbara.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.971
I don't want trouble.
Just tryin' to be polite.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.557
No, you're not. You're
talkin' about the ocean.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.726
- Hey, there!
- What do you want?

26:00.810 --> 26:03.563
- What's goin' on?
- What do you want?

26:03.646 --> 26:07.692
What do I want?
I wanna see your brains.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.236
- Shit!
- Run, man, run!

26:10.319 --> 26:12.989
Sorry, sir.
I didn't mean it.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.825
- You sorry enough?
- Yes, sir, I am.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.202
Yeah?
Then prove it.

26:18.286 --> 26:21.205
Come on, prove it.
Show him.

26:21.289 --> 26:25.543
- Get on your knees. Suck his peter!
- Please. I'm sorry.

26:25.626 --> 26:29.714
- I think he's got the point. He's got
the point! - You heard me. Go on.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.425
Do it! I'll kill you.
I'll blow your brains out.

26:32.508 --> 26:36.345
Okay, okay, okay.
Don't shoot me, please.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.390
Now go on.
Go on.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.767
All right.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.561
God.

26:43.644 --> 26:47.565
Son of a gun.
You're gonna do it?

26:47.648 --> 26:49.942
Sick bastard!

26:50.026 --> 26:52.570
Ohh! Oh, God, my eye!

26:55.239 --> 26:57.867
Get the hell outta here.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.453
You call the cops,
I'll kill ya!

27:00.536 --> 27:02.371
Hurry up, man! Come on!

27:02.455 --> 27:05.458
I don't think
they'd dare call the cops,

27:05.541 --> 27:08.669
but we better get the hell
outta here in case they do.

27:08.753 --> 27:13.299
- What do ya got, Easy? - Ain't no harm
gonna come to that girl 'cause of me?

27:13.382 --> 27:16.636
Mr. Carter wants to buy her a gold
ring and live happily ever after.

27:16.719 --> 27:20.222
- What do ya got? - Woman told me she
was with a man named Frank Green.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.601
Hang on. Where?

27:23.684 --> 27:27.313
- The Skyler Apartments. Skyler and 83rd.
- Skyler and 83rd.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.231
Frank Green. What do you
know about this guy?

27:29.315 --> 27:33.569
He's a gangster, hijacker. Liquor and
cigarettes. Pretty good with a knife.

27:33.653 --> 27:37.198
- Ever seen him in action?
- No, I just heard about him.

27:38.532 --> 27:41.327
Easy.

27:43.954 --> 27:47.333
Here's another hundred.
I'll be calling you again.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.251
Okay.

28:03.599 --> 28:05.851
- Mr. Rawlins, I'm Detective Miller.
- Mason.

28:05.935 --> 28:08.062
- What?
- Turn around and put your hands on the car.

28:08.145 --> 28:11.524
- Come with us.
- Where? Why are you arrestin' me?

28:11.607 --> 28:14.068
- You'll see. - I got a right to
know why you're arrestin' me.

28:14.151 --> 28:17.863
You got a right to fall down, break your
face. You got a right to come with me.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.329
That guy over there?

28:25.413 --> 28:28.332
- You got him, huh?
- Yeah, we got him comin' home.

28:39.635 --> 28:42.054
Ezekiel Rawlins.

28:42.138 --> 28:44.223
We can take those cuffs off
if you want to cooperate.

28:44.306 --> 28:47.143
- Yes, sir. I'm cooperating.
- Turn around.

28:52.022 --> 28:54.483
Sit over there.
Sit down.

28:57.194 --> 29:01.240
Now, earlier this morning
about 5:00 a.m.

29:01.323 --> 29:05.411
- What do you mean?
- He means this morning.

29:05.494 --> 29:09.206
I was... I was out drinkin'.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.208
I carried a friend
into his house.

29:11.292 --> 29:14.211
I don't know. I could've been on my
way home. I ain't look at no clock.

29:16.797 --> 29:21.010
- You were drinkin'. Illegal club
called John's. - What is goin' on?

29:21.093 --> 29:24.597
You may as well answer. You got bigger
troubles than us bustin' some bar.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.224
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.685
We're talkin' about
taking your black ass out...

29:29.769 --> 29:32.354
and puttin' a bullet
in your head.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.899
Sit down.

29:39.862 --> 29:43.741
- Now, what time did you leave Coretta
James' house? - Around 5:30, I guess.

29:43.824 --> 29:46.702
- You go back later in the day?
- No, sir, I did not.

29:46.786 --> 29:49.538
You and Dupree Brouchard, did
you have words over Miss James?

29:49.622 --> 29:52.792
- Words?
- Did you two argue over Coretta James?

29:52.875 --> 29:56.962
- Did you argue over Coretta?
- No, we didn't. He was asleep.

29:57.046 --> 30:00.716
Yeah, she went to sleep too,
but she's not gonna wake up.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.969
- What?
- Where did you go when you left Miss James?

30:04.053 --> 30:06.263
Wait, wait, wait.
What you talkin' about?

30:06.347 --> 30:09.809
- Where did you go?
- I was... I had a hangover.

30:09.892 --> 30:11.977
- You had a hangover?
- Yeah, I went home.

30:12.061 --> 30:14.730
Oh, he had a hangover.
That explains everything.

30:17.274 --> 30:20.444
Back off! Back off!
Back off!

30:20.528 --> 30:22.321
- Here, here.
- No, no! Get outta here!

30:22.404 --> 30:25.157
- Let me at him.
- Go on, get out! Get outta here!

30:25.241 --> 30:28.661
- Come on, you son of a bitch!
- Jack, get out, goddamn...

30:28.744 --> 30:31.163
- All right. All right.
- Calm down. Calm down.

30:31.247 --> 30:32.998
- You son of a bitch.
- Jesus!

30:45.719 --> 30:49.473
<i>They left me alone in that
musty little room another three hours,</i>

30:49.557 --> 30:53.143
<i>till some guy in a suit about two sizes too
big for him came in and said I could go.</i>

30:53.227 --> 30:56.814
- Hey, buddy. - <i>The game of cops and
niggers kept up outside the station,</i>

30:56.897 --> 30:58.816
<i>but I hardly even noticed.</i>

30:58.899 --> 31:02.695
<i>I had seen dead bodies before,</i>

31:02.778 --> 31:06.532
<i>...cold, hard,
still as concrete,</i>

31:06.615 --> 31:09.410
<i>...their eyes wide open,
starin' up at nothin'.</i>

31:09.493 --> 31:11.996
<i>But not Coretta.</i>

31:12.079 --> 31:14.748
<i>I could still feel
her heartbeat.</i>

31:29.722 --> 31:32.516
Hey, Ezekiel Rawlins.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.312
Hold on, Ezekiel. Somebody in the
back would like to talk to you.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.564
I ain't got time right now.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.816
Get in.
We'll take you.

31:48.407 --> 31:52.411
My boss wants to talk
to you about Coretta James.

31:55.789 --> 31:59.543
Listen, if he wanted to hurt you,
it would've happened already.

31:59.627 --> 32:02.087
Come on.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.839
Get in.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.619
You want to go up front
and sit with Norman?

32:33.702 --> 32:35.871
Okay, give me a kiss.

32:42.127 --> 32:45.422
That's my adopted son, Jesus.

32:47.091 --> 32:51.637
I can see the police
roughed you up a bit.

32:51.720 --> 32:55.349
That's a practice of theirs
that has to change, Mr. Rawlins.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.393
- That has to change.
- Thank you.

32:58.310 --> 33:03.524
She was beaten... and died of a
heavy blow to the back of the head.

33:06.735 --> 33:08.654
I suppose you
already know that.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.823
No, I didn't, Mr. Terell.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.825
Oh, you know who I am?

33:12.908 --> 33:16.453
I read the newspapers. You're runnin'
for mayor against Todd Carter.

33:16.537 --> 33:18.831
<i>I am</i> the next mayor,
Mr. Rawlins.

33:18.914 --> 33:22.251
And, luckily for you,
a friend of the Negro.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.170
Coretta worked
for a while for me.

33:25.254 --> 33:29.842
She answered phones at my campaign
office on 103rd and Western.

33:29.925 --> 33:33.846
So when I heard that
the police had a suspect,

33:33.929 --> 33:37.516
I got out of bed immediately,
personally, because of my concern.

33:39.601 --> 33:42.604
Was there anyone with you,
Mr. Rawlins?

33:42.688 --> 33:45.816
Anyone besides
Mr. Dupree Brouchard?

33:45.899 --> 33:47.526
No, sir.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.946
A young lady
named Daphne Monet, perhaps?

33:54.491 --> 33:56.785
Nobody.

33:56.869 --> 33:59.872
Of course not.
I mean, why would-

33:59.955 --> 34:03.792
Why would you tell someone
whom you've only just met?

34:03.876 --> 34:05.878
I mean-

34:07.463 --> 34:09.547
You can trust me,
Mr. Rawlins.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.967
There was nobody else there.

34:15.471 --> 34:19.891
I believe you. Uh, can we
drop you off at your-

34:19.975 --> 34:22.728
No. I mean-
I can get out here.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.355
Are you sure?
This must be quite out of your way.

34:25.438 --> 34:28.150
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

34:32.862 --> 34:36.824
May I offer you
cab fare?

34:36.909 --> 34:38.952
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?

34:39.036 --> 34:42.414
- It's okay.
- Norman.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.570
<i>Oh, you're hittin' my spot.</i>

35:15.531 --> 35:18.242
<i>Daphne sleep by now, so-</i>

35:18.325 --> 35:22.746
<i>Go around here
tellin' everybody “Dahlia.”</i>

35:22.830 --> 35:26.792
<i>Colored women ain't good enough
for you no more, huh, Easy?</i>

35:26.875 --> 35:31.088
<i>All you doin' is sniffin'
after my friend Daphne.</i>

35:31.171 --> 35:34.049
<i>Colored women ain't good enough
for you no more, huh, Easy?</i>

35:37.469 --> 35:40.139
Man!

35:46.603 --> 35:49.815
- Uh-huh.
<i>- Hello. Is this Mr. Rawlins?</i>

35:49.898 --> 35:52.442
Yeah, who's this?

35:52.526 --> 35:55.571
<i>This is Daphne Monet.</i>

35:55.654 --> 35:58.073
<i>You're looking for me.</i>

35:58.157 --> 36:00.159
Who told you that?

36:00.242 --> 36:03.954
<i>You know who told me.
Coretta.</i>

36:05.581 --> 36:08.792
<i>She was found
murdered this morning.</i>

36:08.876 --> 36:12.171
<i>I don't know what I should do.</i>

36:12.254 --> 36:16.842
<i>Would you care to talk to me, or is this
something I should call the police about?</i>

36:16.925 --> 36:19.178
No, no. Ain't no reason
to call the police.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.930
<i>Then why don't you
explain yourself to me?</i>

36:22.014 --> 36:25.601
I'm at the Ambassador Hotel.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.686
<i>This part of the hotel
is white only,</i>

36:27.769 --> 36:30.355
<i>so go to the side entrance
in half an hour...</i>

36:30.439 --> 36:33.734
<i>and Louis the bellboy
will sneak you up.</i>

37:03.263 --> 37:05.265
Hello, Mr. Rawlins.

37:05.349 --> 37:08.644
Hello, Miss Monet.

37:11.021 --> 37:12.648
I don't know
if I should think of you...

37:12.731 --> 37:15.400
as a friend of Coretta's
or as a private dick.

37:15.484 --> 37:19.071
Well, I ain't no detective.

37:19.154 --> 37:23.825
No, I was just hired by a fella
that, uh, works for Todd Carter.

37:25.994 --> 37:29.581
You know, I had to pay Coretta
not to tell you where I was.

37:29.665 --> 37:31.708
Oh, she got you too.

37:35.003 --> 37:39.675
Yeah. Yeah, she definitely
gave me the wrong address.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.677
Where did she say I was?

37:41.760 --> 37:46.431
Said you was out in Watts, over to the Skyler
Arms Apartments with a fella named Frank Green.

37:46.515 --> 37:50.352
Mm-hmm. What else
did she tell you about me?

37:50.435 --> 37:53.105
What else is there to tell?

37:53.188 --> 37:56.858
Nothing. I make no apology
for my feelings for Frank.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.445
He's very dear to me,
and that's that. Bourbon?

38:00.529 --> 38:02.447
Please. Straight up.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.785
So how well
did you know Coretta?

38:06.868 --> 38:09.496
She was a very close friend.

38:09.579 --> 38:13.750
So maybe you know
why she got killed?

38:15.711 --> 38:17.671
Why would I know that?

38:17.754 --> 38:21.133
You said she was a very close friend.
She knew about Frank.

38:21.216 --> 38:24.136
Maybe somebody wanted
to keep that secret.

38:24.219 --> 38:27.639
- Mr. Rawlins, if you're thinking...
- You can call me Easy.

38:27.723 --> 38:32.144
Easy, if you're thinking that Frank had
anything to do with Coretta's death,

38:32.227 --> 38:35.188
then obviously you don't know
very much about him.

38:35.272 --> 38:37.691
Frank doesn't go around
beating people up.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.651
He prefers to use
a knife as his weapon.

38:41.028 --> 38:43.238
And what do you prefer
to use as your weapon?

38:47.451 --> 38:50.370
Why don't you search me
and find out?

39:14.144 --> 39:16.271
Mind if I have
another drink?

39:16.355 --> 39:19.399
Help yourself.

39:23.945 --> 39:26.531
- Listen, Mr. Rawlins...
- Easy.

39:26.615 --> 39:29.284
Easy, the real reason
I called you is because...

39:29.368 --> 39:32.537
I'd like you to drive me
to Todd's house.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.539
Beg your pardon?

39:34.623 --> 39:39.169
Well, you've found me, and now I want
you to take me to Todd Carter's.

39:39.252 --> 39:42.214
Why didn't you call Carter,
have him send for you?

39:42.297 --> 39:46.885
Well, I have to go
someplace else on the way.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.971
Someplace that I don't want
Todd to know about.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.187
There's a man
named Richard McGee,

39:57.270 --> 39:59.648
and he lives
up in Laurel Canyon.

39:59.731 --> 40:04.361
And he delivered a letter of mine to the
wrong place, and I need to get it back.

40:04.444 --> 40:08.865
At 4:00 in the morning? Must
be a pretty important letter.

40:08.949 --> 40:11.076
Yes, it is.

40:11.159 --> 40:14.413
But I need to go there
before I go to Todd's.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.581
<i>I'll</i> pay <i>You-</i>

40:18.166 --> 40:21.169
What time you talk
to Coretta this morning?

40:23.588 --> 40:26.091
I don't know.
7:30, 8:00, I guess.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.885
Uh, listen, Easy,
I don't-

40:28.969 --> 40:32.180
I don't really want to talk
about Coretta just now.

40:32.264 --> 40:33.849
Did you go up to her house?

40:42.858 --> 40:45.193
No.

40:45.277 --> 40:47.529
She called me.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.200
She was in a good mood.

40:52.284 --> 40:55.704
She always, uh...

40:55.787 --> 40:58.957
Look, I didn't mean
to upset you, Daphne. I'm-

40:59.040 --> 41:01.626
You understand. I-

41:01.710 --> 41:05.130
As far as I know, you was the
last one to talk to her.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.132
And I don't mean
to upset you,

41:07.215 --> 41:11.261
but as far as I know, you were the last
one with her before she got killed.

41:11.344 --> 41:14.890
Now where does that leave us?

41:19.811 --> 41:22.439
All right.

41:22.522 --> 41:25.442
Why don't you go and change
out of that housecoat?

41:25.525 --> 41:27.736
I'll carry you along.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.918
Are you nervous?

41:43.001 --> 41:46.254
<i>Nervous? Here I was
in the middle of the night...</i>

41:46.338 --> 41:49.049
<i>in a white neighborhood
with a White Woman in my oar.</i>

41:49.132 --> 41:52.093
<i>No, I wasn't nervous.
I was stupid.</i>

41:52.177 --> 41:54.346
You make a left
up here.

41:54.429 --> 41:58.767
<i>Gettin' Daphne back to Todd
Carter didn't seem so easy.</i>

41:58.850 --> 42:01.228
<i>Who was this guy
Richard McGee?</i>

42:01.311 --> 42:03.730
Just park
behind that car.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.364
<i>I'll see ya later, Pop.</i>

42:12.447 --> 42:15.534
<i>Sidney! Sidney!
That's all I've been hearing!</i>

42:15.617 --> 42:18.870
<i>Everybody's doin' things
for Sidney! Where are ya?</i>

42:18.954 --> 42:22.958
<i>I'm in here, with Sidney.
In the living room, dear.</i>

42:23.041 --> 42:25.418
<i>I've gotta get
rid of that guy.</i>

42:25.502 --> 42:27.712
<i>Oh, hello, dear.</i>

42:27.796 --> 42:30.549
<i>Sit down, Reilly.
Make yourself at home.</i>

42:33.218 --> 42:35.512
<i>Thanks, Moynihan.</i>

42:35.595 --> 42:38.431
<i>Oh, my, you
look awful tired, dear.</i>

42:38.515 --> 42:42.310
<i>Yeah, Reilly. Pick out
a comfortable chair and plop.</i>

42:42.394 --> 42:45.105
<i>I already picked one out,
but you're sittin' in it.</i>

42:45.188 --> 42:47.983
<i>Oh, Reilly, guess what
Sid and I have been playing?</i>

43:23.018 --> 43:25.770
Mmm! Ohh!

43:27.689 --> 43:30.775
Oh, my God!

43:30.859 --> 43:33.194
Oh, my God!

45:05.787 --> 45:11.459
<i>♪ All alone ♪</i>

45:11.543 --> 45:14.129
- Hey, who's that at the door?
- It's him.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.173
- Oh, yeah?
- You fought in Europe?

45:17.257 --> 45:21.177
- Easy.
- What you doin' in my house, man?

45:22.762 --> 45:25.306
What happened
to your head, hmm?

45:25.390 --> 45:27.976
What the hell are y'all
doin' in my house?

45:28.059 --> 45:30.395
Y'all ain't got no right
to break into my house.

45:30.478 --> 45:32.856
Where you been
this time of mornin', Easy?

45:32.939 --> 45:36.234
I went to see a girl. Why?
You don't get none, Albright?

45:36.317 --> 45:39.070
I didn't come here
to play, nigger.

45:39.154 --> 45:41.197
Okay?

45:41.281 --> 45:44.200
That's my money
you got in your pocket.

45:44.284 --> 45:47.287
We've been by that address
you gave me on Frank Green.

45:47.370 --> 45:51.040
He's already moved from there,
a year ago.

45:51.124 --> 45:54.544
What do you want me to do? You don't
like the way I'm doin' my job?

45:54.627 --> 45:56.212
I'll give your money...

45:56.296 --> 46:01.259
Believe in God, Easy, huh? I'm curious to see
if things any different for a religious man.

46:01.342 --> 46:05.013
Let me show you what I do to people that
say they seen things they ain't seen.

46:05.096 --> 46:07.307
- I seen her.
- Where?

46:07.390 --> 46:10.143
- She...
- Come on.

46:10.226 --> 46:14.439
She called me. She had me to carry
her up to the Hollywood hills.

46:14.522 --> 46:17.066
- Where is she now?
- She... She took off.

46:17.150 --> 46:18.902
Bullshit.
Where is she now?

46:18.985 --> 46:22.739
She took off.
There's a dead man up there.

46:22.822 --> 46:26.326
While I was lookin' at it,
she took off.

46:33.333 --> 46:35.168
Come on in.

46:40.715 --> 46:42.675
Sit down.

46:44.552 --> 46:47.305
Okay.

46:47.388 --> 46:50.934
What she do, take his car?

46:51.017 --> 46:53.812
- Huh?
- McGee.

46:53.895 --> 46:56.815
- Yeah. - If you can write, write
down where you picked her up at.

46:59.526 --> 47:01.611
Write it down.

47:16.251 --> 47:20.964
This bologna
gets stuck in my... my molar.

47:21.047 --> 47:24.300
I get that with popcorn.

47:24.384 --> 47:27.470
Get me some whiskey, Easy.

47:27.554 --> 47:31.182
Liquor's in the cabinet.
You get it your damn self.

47:37.105 --> 47:39.399
He's got balls.
You gotta give him that.

47:39.482 --> 47:43.194
Shoot him.
No, I'm just kidding.

47:50.869 --> 47:54.789
Oh. Easy,
you're a brave man.

47:54.873 --> 47:57.667
I need a brave man
working for me.

47:57.750 --> 48:01.713
You're doin' a nice job too, but...
Get me a whiskey bottle.

48:01.796 --> 48:05.550
You gotta find Frank Green,
so he can lead us to her.

48:05.633 --> 48:07.886
No, thank you.

48:07.969 --> 48:11.556
Too many people gettin'
killed around me already.

48:11.639 --> 48:15.643
Thanks.

48:15.727 --> 48:20.148
Easy, you're connectable
to two murders.

48:21.774 --> 48:25.320
You're gonna
do whatever I tell you to do.

48:27.822 --> 48:30.366
You find him.
I will be checkin' in.

48:37.165 --> 48:41.002
That's some cheap shit.
Let's go. Come on.

48:57.143 --> 49:00.063
<i>Since Albright
liked surprise parties,</i>

49:00.146 --> 49:03.274
<i>I had a friend of my own
I wanted to invite.</i>

49:03.358 --> 49:06.361
<i>I placed a call to
Etta Mae Alexander in Houston.</i>

49:06.444 --> 49:09.864
<i>Told her to get a message
to her husband... Mouse.</i>

49:19.707 --> 49:23.544
Cast your vote for Matthew Terell.

49:27.465 --> 49:30.009
Vote for Matthew Terell!

49:31.844 --> 49:40.061
Cast your vote on June 11th
for Matthew Terell!

49:55.243 --> 49:58.329
Hey. Easy.

49:58.413 --> 50:00.540
That girl called me
last night, Joppy.

50:00.623 --> 50:04.460
- What girl is that? - The one your
friend Albright is lookin' for.

50:04.544 --> 50:06.921
Uh-huh.
That's pretty lucky.

50:07.005 --> 50:09.465
No, it wasn't no luck
at all, Joppy. It was you.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.845
You and Coretta was the onliest
ones that had my phone number...

50:13.928 --> 50:15.847
and knew I was
lookin' for the girl.

50:15.930 --> 50:18.850
And Coretta was too busy scammin'
Daphne, so it couldn't have been her.

50:18.933 --> 50:21.102
Maybe she looked it up
in the phone book.

50:21.185 --> 50:23.980
I ain't in the phone book.
You supposed to be my friend!

50:24.063 --> 50:26.315
Why in the hell didn't you
tell the man your damn self?

50:26.399 --> 50:30.194
What the hell you mean lookin' all ugly
like you <i>think</i> you gonna do somethin'?

50:30.278 --> 50:32.697
<i>I think</i>
I'm gonna do somethin'.

50:32.780 --> 50:36.409
Hey. Hey!
Stop that shit! You-

50:36.492 --> 50:39.954
Boy! That's my marble! My uncle
left me that after he died!

50:40.038 --> 50:44.625
- Goddamn it, he's about to get it back too!
- All right! Let's talk!

50:44.709 --> 50:47.170
- What you got me into?
- She asked me to help her,

50:47.253 --> 50:50.006
'cause I told her Albright
was lookin' for her,

50:50.089 --> 50:52.383
so I figured I could help you
make a few dollars.

50:52.467 --> 50:55.344
She wanted to know somethin' about you,
so I told her, gave her your number.

50:55.428 --> 50:57.388
- Where's she at, Joppy?
- I don't know!

50:57.472 --> 51:00.141
- Don't lie to me!
- I am not lying to you!

51:00.224 --> 51:03.728
- What's she runnin' from then?
- She didn't tell me!

51:03.811 --> 51:08.357
Easy. Look at me!
I am your friend.

51:08.441 --> 51:12.361
Now... I didn't mean to get you
in no trouble.

51:12.445 --> 51:15.865
I just... I mean...
Look, you... you seen her.

51:15.948 --> 51:18.493
I mean, she <i>is</i>
somethin' else, man!

51:20.161 --> 51:23.915
You know what I'm sayin'.

51:23.998 --> 51:26.959
Oh, Joppy...

51:32.799 --> 51:34.717
What?

51:40.807 --> 51:44.644
<i>Like Albright said, when
you're mixed up in somethin',</i>

51:44.727 --> 51:47.230
<i>you better be mixed up
to the top.</i>

51:47.313 --> 51:49.440
<i>So that's where I was goin',</i>

51:49.524 --> 51:52.401
<i>all the way to the top.</i>

51:52.485 --> 51:56.656
<i>Everybody was peein' on my head
and tellin' me it was rain.</i>

51:56.739 --> 52:00.493
<i>Guess they figured I was some</i> new
<i>kind of fool, and maybe I was,</i>

52:00.576 --> 52:03.245
<i>'cause I was ready
to start fightin' back.</i>

52:03.329 --> 52:06.958
<i>And I believed that I could live
through this bad dream I was havin'...</i>

52:07.041 --> 52:09.085
<i>about pretty girls
and gangsters...</i>

52:09.168 --> 52:13.965
<i>and standin' face-to-face
with the richest man in town.</i>

52:28.563 --> 52:32.775
- May I help you?
- Uh, yes, ma'am. I'm looking for Mr. Carter.

52:32.859 --> 52:34.861
I'm sorry, Mr. Carter's
a very busy man.

52:34.944 --> 52:38.239
Too busy to hear something about that
little chippy of his that dumped him?

52:38.322 --> 52:41.868
Excuse me. Mr.-

52:41.951 --> 52:46.414
- Rawlins.
- Why don't you come with me, sir?

52:50.501 --> 52:54.130
Not very smart talking about Mr.
Carter's business to a secretary.

52:54.213 --> 52:59.093
I don't wanna hear it. Too much goin' on for me
to give a damn about what you think is smart.

53:12.690 --> 53:14.775
Wait here, Mr. Rawlins.

53:27.330 --> 53:29.290
Mr. Carter will see you.

53:31.459 --> 53:34.712
- Mr., uh, Rawlins.
- Mr. Carter.

53:34.795 --> 53:39.550
- You've heard from Daphne.
- Yeah, last night.

53:39.634 --> 53:43.054
- Uh, is she still in town?
- She was last night.

53:43.137 --> 53:46.807
And... what did she say?

53:46.891 --> 53:52.063
- Wh-What was she wearing?
- Uh... blue dress, high heels.

53:52.146 --> 53:55.691
Mmm. That's her. I'm sorry.
Would you like to come in?

53:59.654 --> 54:01.489
- Mr. Carter...
- Have a seat.

54:01.572 --> 54:03.908
Thank you. I just
want some answers.

54:03.991 --> 54:06.410
- Would you like a brandy?
- Thank you.

54:06.494 --> 54:10.581
- I wanna know what I got myself into.
- Beg your pardon?

54:10.665 --> 54:13.793
Well, I wanna know the real reason Mr.
Albright hired me.

54:16.462 --> 54:21.342
- Mr. Albright.
- Yeah, the man you hired to find Daphne.

54:22.510 --> 54:24.553
I think there's
been a mistake here.

54:24.637 --> 54:26.597
I, uh...

54:26.681 --> 54:28.599
Who are you talking about?

54:28.683 --> 54:34.272
Wait a minute... You... You didn't hire
somebody to find your girlfriend?

54:34.355 --> 54:36.357
Of course not.

54:36.440 --> 54:40.403
As a matter of fact, I thought she was
hundreds of miles away from here.

54:42.446 --> 54:45.408
- You say someone's looking for her.
- Yeah.

54:45.491 --> 54:49.245
Someone's looking for her.

54:49.328 --> 54:53.207
Look, Mr. Carter, nothing personal,
but wh-what's goin' on between y'all?

54:53.291 --> 54:56.294
Nothing.

54:56.377 --> 54:59.547
We were going to get married
and we had a fight,

54:59.630 --> 55:03.217
and it is none of your concern,
Mr., uh, Rawlins.

55:03.301 --> 55:06.137
So someone's after her.
Mr. Albright.

55:06.220 --> 55:12.143
- And he says I'm his employer.
- You ever heard of a fellow named Richard McGee?

55:12.226 --> 55:14.145
Who?

55:16.897 --> 55:20.234
Look... I... Why would
somebody be after her?

55:20.318 --> 55:22.820
Mr. Rawlins, do you think
you can find her again?

55:22.903 --> 55:26.449
It's important.
For her sake.

55:26.532 --> 55:28.492
I'm willing to pay you.

55:28.576 --> 55:31.495
Why'd she leave
in the first place?

55:31.579 --> 55:36.834
It's really none of your concern, but
I am willing to pay you to find her.

55:37.918 --> 55:39.837
Okay.

55:40.546 --> 55:41.881
Okay.

55:43.799 --> 55:47.511
- One thousand dollars.
- A thousand dollars.

55:47.595 --> 55:50.598
Yeah. Yeah. <i>I'll</i> take
two hundred right now.

55:50.681 --> 55:55.102
I think you're trying to take advantage
of me. Let me inform you of something.

55:55.186 --> 55:58.856
The incumbent mayor, the chief of
police... close personal friends of mine.

55:58.939 --> 56:01.484
They eat at my house regularly,
and my father's house.

56:01.567 --> 56:03.986
That's good, Mr. Carter. Then
they can help us find her.

56:07.615 --> 56:09.575
No, they can't.

56:10.785 --> 56:12.703
<i>I'll</i> have Baxter
write you out a check.

56:12.787 --> 56:17.375
- Mr. Carter, why you stop runnin' for mayor?
- I'll have Baxter write a check.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.502
All right, why is Matthew
Terell lookin' for Daphne too?

56:19.585 --> 56:21.504
Baxter will write you a check.

56:21.587 --> 56:23.964
I'll take cash.

56:30.763 --> 56:33.641
Here, take it all.
Just take it all.

56:38.104 --> 56:41.232
I'll be in touch,
Mr. Carter.

56:56.288 --> 56:58.332
<i>So Albright had lied to me.</i>

56:58.416 --> 57:01.252
<i>Instead of workin' for Carter, he
was workin' for Matthew Terell,</i>

57:01.335 --> 57:03.796
<i>the man runnin' for mayor
against Caner.</i>

57:03.879 --> 57:08.842
<i>And, for whatever reason, they was all throwin'
money my way to find the girl in the blue dress.</i>

57:08.926 --> 57:11.387
<i>Anyway, I knew that
her boyfriend, Frank Green,</i>

57:11.470 --> 57:13.431
<i>hijacked trucks
haulin' liquor...</i>

57:13.514 --> 57:17.101
<i>and sold it at half the price
to places down on Central Avenue.</i>

57:17.184 --> 57:21.271
<i>So I decided to kick up some dust
night in Frank is backyard.</i>

57:26.861 --> 57:29.697
- Good evening, Smoky.
- Good evening. Please.

57:29.780 --> 57:32.783
- Your seat.
- Thanks.

57:32.867 --> 57:36.078
- Now, Mr. Rawlins. What were you saying?
- Frank Green.

57:36.162 --> 57:38.122
- Who?
- I'm lookin' for Frank Green.

57:38.205 --> 57:41.085
- I don't know Frank Green.
- Aw, come on. Why you treatin' me like this?

57:41.125 --> 57:43.711
- I don't know any Frank Green!
- You don't know Frank.

57:43.794 --> 57:45.713
You know <i>me</i>, though,
don't you?

57:54.221 --> 57:58.225
Hey, I'm talkin' to my man. He told
me to talk to you. Frank Green.

57:58.309 --> 58:01.228
- Who is that?
- What do you mean, who is that?

58:01.312 --> 58:04.148
He told me to talk
to you! Now, come on.

58:04.231 --> 58:07.526
- I don't wanna talk about that...
- Well, gimme a beer.

58:07.610 --> 58:10.196
Can I get a beer?
Can I get a beer?

58:10.279 --> 58:12.615
- Give him a beer.
- Thank you.

58:12.698 --> 58:16.702
- Here you go. - Wait, Frank Green
told me that you have pints.

58:16.785 --> 58:19.955
- Who's Frank Green? I have no idea who...
- You know who Frank Green is.

58:20.039 --> 58:24.168
- Al! Talk to this man.
- Aw, come on. Y'all know who Frank Green is.

58:24.251 --> 58:27.296
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- You don't know Frank Green.

58:27.379 --> 58:29.632
Well, let's get him
on the phone. Frank told me-

58:39.934 --> 58:42.436
- Hey, Ezekiel.
- Don't need my trees cut.

58:42.520 --> 58:45.105
They...
Ezekiel.

58:46.148 --> 58:48.025
Ezekiel! Ezekiel!

58:48.108 --> 58:52.279
- Ezekiel!
- What?

58:52.363 --> 58:54.448
There's a man!

59:03.123 --> 59:06.043
Ow! Ow!

59:06.126 --> 59:08.128
Damn! Frank,
wait a minute! Wait!

59:08.212 --> 59:10.339
Hold it! Let's talk!

59:12.550 --> 59:15.135
Let's talk, Frank.

59:18.138 --> 59:22.977
Frank, wait a minute! I got $500 for
you, Frank! Rich white man wants to-

59:34.780 --> 59:37.032
Aaah!

59:43.831 --> 59:46.333
Aaah.

59:46.417 --> 59:48.919
Hey.

59:49.003 --> 59:51.213
Want me to shoot this
son of a bitch, Easy?

59:51.297 --> 59:53.674
- Mouse!
- Huh? Want me to shoot him?

59:53.757 --> 59:55.634
No. No.

59:57.261 --> 01:00:00.139
It's all right.

01:00:00.222 --> 01:00:03.892
What the hell
is happenin', man?

01:00:03.976 --> 01:00:06.770
- Goddamn, I'm gonna blow your nose off!
- No, wait! Don't shoot him!

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:11.942
Where's Daphne Monet,
Frank?

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:17.573
All right, maybe you don't know, where she is,
but, hey, we can help each other find her, man.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.200
- Nigger, you heard him.
- Mouse, no!

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.375
- Rawlins residence.
- Sit down.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:32.296
No, he's busy right now. You're
gonna have to call back.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:36.634
Look.

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:41.096
A rich man is willin' to pay $1,000
just to talk to this girl.

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:45.100
A thousand dollars! That's a
hell of a lot of money, man!

01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:52.816
- Frank.
- Wait, wait a minute. Let me try.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.113
Now, look here, Frank.
It's-It's Frank, right?

01:00:58.197 --> 01:01:02.159
- Yeah.
- Frank.

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:08.666
- What the hell are you...
- Let go of me, man! Let go!

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:11.752
Frank!
Damn it!

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:14.797
Don't you ever grab me
when I got a gun in my hand!

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.509
Shit.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:23.931
You got blood on my coat, Easy.
It's a damn expensive coat!

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.395
Where's your bathroom at?
In there?

01:01:36.568 --> 01:01:40.781
Whew! We gotta find that girl
so we can get that money, huh?

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.033
Hell, no! We don't
have to go find nobody.

01:01:43.117 --> 01:01:46.370
I changed my mind. I don't
need your kind of help, Mouse.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:48.455
Boy, look at you.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:51.859
Man out a damn smile in your neck. You gonna
tell me you don't need my kind of help?

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:55.170
This is the same shit you pulled
when you killed old man Navrochet.

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:58.382
You ain't even been in my house five
minutes, and you done shot somebody already!

01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:03.053
- Come on, Easy! Cut me in
on this thing, man. - Nah.

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:05.222
Easy, I'm tryin' to do right.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.558
I'm...
I mean, you know, now.

01:02:09.977 --> 01:02:13.939
Man, I can help you. You gonna
need somebody at your back.

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:16.984
I swear I'm gonna
let you run the show.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:20.404
<i>Let</i> me run the show! I ain't gonna
do nothin' you don't tell me to do!

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:24.700
You gonna <i>let</i> me
run the show?

01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:30.706
- You gonna do everything I say?
- Everything you say.

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:33.959
- That's the wrong hand, Mouse.
- Oh.

01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:39.590
- Boy, how you been?
- Easy.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.718
- Who was that on the phone?
- Oh, uh, I don't know, man.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.762
Sounded like some white girl.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.620
Ezekiel. Came to ask you
a few more questions.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:14.458
- So why don't you invite us in?
- I'll come out.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.253
What happened to your neck?
Did I do that?

01:03:18.337 --> 01:03:20.756
I don't remember
doin' that.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:23.383
What do you know about a man
named Richard McGee?

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:25.636
A dead white man in a cabin
over in Laurel Canyon.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:30.265
He just happens to have a note in his
pocket with “Coretta James” written on it.

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:32.017
You feel a little
more talkative?

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.562
'Cause I'll bet you six bits to a bottle
of piss we're lookin' at a double here.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:38.398
All we gotta do is place you
in the dead man's house.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.400
I wasn't in
no dead man's house.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:43.320
We could go down to the station,
send a team over here.

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:46.865
Believe me, they'll find somethin' that
will place you at that dead man's house.

01:03:46.949 --> 01:03:49.660
Evidence has a funny way
of showin' up, you know?

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:53.163
Nah, y'all ain't got nothin', 'cause I
ain't done nothin', and you know I ain't.

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:56.834
You know a lot more than you're lettin' on.
Tell us, or you're goin' down...

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:59.253
for the murder of Richard McGee
and Coretta James.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.547
- There's nothin' to tell you.
I don't know nothin'. - Sure you do.

01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:05.342
- Let's go. - All right, look.
Just give me a little more time.

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:09.888
- Forget it. - Maybe till tomorrow
morning. Maybe I can dig somethin' up.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:15.811
What d'you think, Jack? We could do that.
Take the cuffs off.

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.773
You got till
tomorrow morning.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.195
Have a nice evening,
Ezekiel.

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:28.907
<i>I played along, just
like the cops wanted me to.</i>

01:04:28.991 --> 01:04:31.118
<i>It was all a game to them.</i>

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:34.997
<i>But in the mornin' they'd be playin' for
keeps, 'cause a white man was dead now.</i>

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.292
<i>And guilty or not, somebody was
gonna have to pay for this one.</i>

01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:47.050
Hey, man. Is Dupree's sister's house off
of Compton Boulevard or Compton Avenue?

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:49.511
- I can't find it. - Don't worry about
it. We're goin' somewhere else first.

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:51.513
Oh, did that girl call?

01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:53.849
Easy, we gonna go see
that girl?

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:56.310
No.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.312
Hey. Ezekiel?

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:01.475
- I been watchin' your house and seein'
all them people... - I ain't got time.

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:04.151
- Just leave my trees alone! Okay?
- You got too many trees, man.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:08.238
- I'm gonna knock a couple down...
- Leave my trees alone!

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:12.367
You can tell me what you think
when you get back. All right?

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:46.860
- Who's that?
- Easy.

01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:53.742
- What you want?
- Let me in, Junior. It's private.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:56.870
I ain't got no time. I'm
tryin' to get some sleep.

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:59.414
You better go on open this door, Junior.
Act like you got some sense.

01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:04.044
- Mouse. - Go on, fool. Get out
the way. We ain't got all day.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.172
Have a seat.

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:09.716
- Y'all want a beer?
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.387
- What you smokin' there, Junior? Zapatas?
- Uh-huh.

01:06:19.226 --> 01:06:21.979
- This one's yours too, isn't it?
- I dunno.

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:25.315
- So why you kill Richard McGee?
- Huh? What you talkin' about?

01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:27.567
Ain't no time to play, Junior.
I know you the one killed him.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:30.112
- You crazy, man!
- Sit down, Junior.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.829
- Tell me what happened, Junior.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about!

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:41.707
The police will, when they find out the
fingerprints in that man's house belong to you.

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:43.750
What fingerprints?
What house?

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.962
Hattie had you to pull that man outta
John's bar the night I was there,

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:50.716
and he was layin' dead with the same
suit on and a bullet hole in his head!

01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:54.344
- I ain't killed nobody.
- Quit lyin', you big old, sweaty, thickheaded,

01:06:54.428 --> 01:06:56.722
- corn bread-eatin'...
- Thickheaded your damn self!

01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:59.641
Sit down, Junior.

01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:03.687
Go on, sit down now.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:13.613
Now, you better tell me.
Maybe I'll forget what I know.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:16.033
Otherwise, I'm gonna
tell Mouse to shoot you,

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:18.535
'cause I don't like your ass
and he don't like you either.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:21.872
- I don't even know who you're talkin' about.
- You just <i>had</i> to rob him!

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:26.293
- I didn't touch nothin' in that man's house!
- Goddamn, Junior.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.839
Mm-hmm. Sit down.

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:36.845
Hattie had me take him
out to his car.

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:39.890
The man was so drunk he give me
$10 to drive him home.

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:43.351
- I know you took that.
- Hell, yeah.

01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:46.813
Then he was askin' me about that
white girl you was askin' about.

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:50.233
I told him I seen her with Coretta.
What the hell I care if he knows?

01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:53.904
- So you goin' tell him, but you won't
tell me. - I don't like your ass, Easy.

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:57.574
- And he give me $50. - Just to tell
him that you saw her with Coretta?

01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:03.455
No. To deliver a letter. I give it to
Coretta to give to her the next mornin'.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:07.709
You better be
tellin' the truth.

01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:09.711
Come on, let's go, Raymond.

01:08:09.795 --> 01:08:12.255
- I'm tellin' the truth. I ain't killed nobody.
- All right, Easy.

01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:15.717
That man was alive when I left.
I... I didn't kill nobody.

01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:19.136
<i>The letter that was
so important to Daphne...</i>

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.598
<i>had worked its way over
to the other side of town...</i>

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.268
<i>to Dupree's sister's house
in Compton... I hoped.</i>

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:28.354
<i>And Junior was innocent
like I Knew all along,</i>

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:33.026
<i>but I couldn't see no harm in lettin' the
big water-head sucker sweat a little bit.</i>

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:46.081
- Hey.
- Hey, now.

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:49.251
- Tried to call you.
- Yeah, cops just let me out today.

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:52.420
Sister's gone to work, and I
ain't feelin' much like talkin'.

01:08:52.504 --> 01:08:54.421
- Raymond!
- Yeah, big man.

01:08:54.506 --> 01:08:56.424
- Hey.
- All right, now.

01:08:56.508 --> 01:08:58.551
- Them pigs' tails I smell up in there?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:02.055
- Lula Mae made some before she went to work.
- Y'all gonna have to excuse me.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.975
Come on.

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:08.353
- Dupree?
- Yeah?

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:12.649
Look, uh...

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:14.943
I'm sorry.

01:09:15.026 --> 01:09:18.404
Thank you, Easy.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:22.408
Why somebody want to kill her like
that, man? It don't make sense to me.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.584
Did Coretta...

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.421
say anything to you about
a letter she was keepin'?

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:38.925
Letter?
What kind of letter?

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:41.261
From that white girl.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:45.849
Nah. But I know it was on account
of her that Coretta got killed.

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.894
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:09:48.977 --> 01:09:53.023
Everything between Daphne and Coretta
was always such a damn secret.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:55.567
That old girl,

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:58.695
she didn't think nothin'
about two-timin' on Frank.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:02.532
- You want some more tails, Raymond?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, Dupree.

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:06.203
You know she messin' around with that
guy runnin' for mayor, don't you?

01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:09.372
- Todd Carter?
- Yeah, Carter. That's his name.

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:13.543
She probably introduced Coretta
to one of them guys she knew.

01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:17.589
He probably came over to the house, saw
that Coretta wasn't that type of woman.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:24.554
Cops says she fought 'im.
Can you imagine that?

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:26.848
<i>My baby fought 'im.</i>

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.312
Fought him 'cause she wouldn't
have nobody but me.

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:40.028
God. I can't sleep.

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:45.742
Huh-uh. I still keep seein' her face
that mornin' before I went to work.

01:10:47.619 --> 01:10:52.290
Junior had just came by the house, and
sh-she come runnin' out, carryin' her Bible.

01:10:54.334 --> 01:10:58.213
She say, uh...
“Keep this for me, baby.”

01:11:01.049 --> 01:11:04.552
- The Bible?
- Yeah.

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:08.640
And the police won't even
let me go near the house.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:14.145
- That's the only thing I got left
that belonged to her. - The Bible.

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:21.111
I know it was a sign,
'cause she's so religious.

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:23.238
Oh, God.

01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:26.908
It's all right,
big man.

01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:29.619
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, that's all right.

01:11:29.703 --> 01:11:32.080
Get you a drink, now.
Go on, now, drink this.

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:35.583
- All right. All right.
- That's enough, Raymond.

01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:37.585
Go on. Drink that.

01:11:47.429 --> 01:11:51.391
<i>Let us all say amen.</i>

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:54.853
<i>Amen. Say it one more time.</i>

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:33.433
<i>I was scared now...</i>

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.852
<i>and sick from what I saw-</i>

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:39.606
<i>pictures of a much younger
Matthew Terell and children.</i>

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:44.027
<i>Innocent, helpless,
naked children.</i>

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:47.280
Mouse.

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:50.033
I got it.
Come on, let's go.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:52.827
Is you crazy
or is you drunk?

01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:56.414
- Come on.
- Am I drunk?

01:12:56.498 --> 01:12:59.918
You saw me draw that gun. Ain't no
man can outdraw me.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.629
- Mouse, put the gun down.
- I'm drunk.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:08.259
I'm drunk, you right.
Gon' put that gun right there.

01:13:08.343 --> 01:13:12.597
We gon' see who's drunk.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.559
Now, watch it.
Watch it! Goddamn it.

01:13:16.643 --> 01:13:19.229
Right there now.
Oh, yeah.

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:22.774
This fool gonna call me out,
he ain't even got no gun.

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:27.570
- I'll kill that motherfucker.
- No, uh... let him go.

01:13:27.654 --> 01:13:30.657
- Hmm?
- Let him live,

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.368
and he'll be scared of you
every time you walk into a room.

01:13:33.451 --> 01:13:35.412
Shit, he better be scared,
goddamn it, I'll kill him.

01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:38.373
- He will. If... If he ain't, I'll...
- You better tell him.

01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:41.251
I... I will.
Trust me.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:45.922
I'll tell him.

01:13:46.005 --> 01:13:50.760
- Right there, goddamn it.
- No. Keep an eye on him.

01:13:50.844 --> 01:13:55.682
- Where you goin'?
- That's right.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.286
<i>The pictures was eatin' at
my pocket like a cigarette burn.</i>

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:20.206
<i>Albright had killed for those pictures,
to get 'em back for Matthew Terell.</i>

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:24.169
<i>He had killed Richard McGee,
who had sold the pictures to Daphne.</i>

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:26.296
<i>Time was runnin' out.</i>

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:29.591
<i>But I had some unfinished
business with the girl.</i>

01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:33.595
<i>She had called that afternoon,
and all I needed was for her to call again.</i>

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.404
Hello. Hello!

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:53.740
Hello.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:14.552
I'm sorry. I broke
into your house, and-

01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:17.514
Please don't be angry with me.

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:20.600
Now, why should I
be angry at you?

01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:29.067
M-May I have a c-cigarette?

01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:37.158
You know, Coretta's boyfriend
Dupree got out of jail today.

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:40.912
And you need me
to help you find him.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:43.581
I already got
the pictures, Daphne.

01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:21.869
You know, I paid $7,000 for those pictures.
They belong to me.

01:16:21.953 --> 01:16:24.664
Matthew Terell might have
somethin' to say about that.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:28.793
All right, then, I'll pay you for them.
I'll give you $1,000.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:31.546
- You gave Richard McGee seven.
- Then I'll give you seven.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:33.881
Damn, what does Terell
have on you, girl?

01:16:33.965 --> 01:16:38.595
- Nothin'. You want the money or not?
- No.

01:16:38.678 --> 01:16:40.805
No. I got two murders
hangin' over my head.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:43.725
Unless I give the oops a killer by
tomorrow mornin', I'm goin' to jail.

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:46.185
- Now, who killed Coretta?
- I don't know.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:48.771
- It was 'cause of them pictures she
was killed, wasn't it? - I don't know.

01:16:48.855 --> 01:16:51.733
Your boyfriend Frank Green killed her
to bring you them pictures, didn't he?

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:53.901
- Of course not. - Well, you
can tell it to the police,

01:16:53.985 --> 01:16:56.321
'cause I ain't
takin' the rap.

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.617
Easy, put the phone down!
Put the phone down!

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:04.203
- Put the phone down. Easy!
- So it was Frank, wasn't it?

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:06.247
- He had nothin' to do with it!
- Yeah, sure he did!

01:17:06.331 --> 01:17:08.207
There was more between y'all
than back-door romance!

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:11.586
He probably pimped you out to Carter in
the first place! We goin' to the police!

01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:14.297
- No! No! - Come on! Yeah,
why don't you scream, huh?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.799
So I can tell the police about
your boyfriend Frank Green!

01:17:16.883 --> 01:17:19.552
- Frank is my brother!
- What?

01:17:22.263 --> 01:17:25.933
Our mother is Creole.
We have different fathers.

01:17:26.017 --> 01:17:28.770
Mine is white.

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:31.314
And that's what
Terell has on me.

01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:35.902
And so far, I've been able
to keep Frank out of this.

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:39.447
- Who killed Coretta?
- It was an accident.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.283
- Who killed her? - She threatened
to sell the pictures to Terell.

01:17:42.367 --> 01:17:45.370
Who killed her?
Goddamn it!

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:47.997
I just asked Joppy to go over
and put a scare into her.

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:50.667
Joppy?

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:53.378
I didn't mean
to hurt anybody!

01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:55.338
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:59.008
But Todd and his family, you know, they had
to pull out of the election because of me.

01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:02.470
They really wanted us to get married. It
was just because of the election that we-

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:08.810
I'll be a son of a bitch.
Get her, Shariff.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.021
Ow!

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:15.024
No!

01:18:15.108 --> 01:18:17.318
Come on, get up.

01:18:17.402 --> 01:18:20.071
- Where are the pictures?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:22.532
Yeah? Take her
to the car.

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:24.534
Get up!

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:28.037
Come on! Who we gonna give up
to cover this shit, huh?

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.526
<i>I woke up Mouse and told
him to drive Dupree's car...</i>

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.528
<i>to 34th and Central,</i>

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:03.865
<i>'cause it had come to me
in less time than it takes to think.</i>

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:05.908
<i>They were takin' Daphne
someplace more deserted...</i>

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:08.161
<i>than Albright's office
up in Hollywood.</i>

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.872
<i>Someplace where there
would be no witnesses.</i>

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:13.416
<i>And I was bein' left alive
to take the fall.</i>

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:32.226
Mouse, give me one
of them guns you got.

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:34.870
- What? - Give me one of them guns.
Start up my car, keep it hot.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:36.856
I'm comin' out fast.

01:19:59.045 --> 01:20:01.923
I saw that cow!

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:08.805
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!

01:20:08.888 --> 01:20:10.807
- All right, all right.
- Blow your face off. Let's go.

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:13.726
- Hey, man!
- Shut up!

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:20.066
- What the hell you doin'?
- Shut up.

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:23.069
What is this, Easy?

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:25.071
Just drive, Mouse.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.252
Joppy, Albright's got the
girl, and he's gon' kill her.

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:42.255
- Tell me where it is, and you better
get it right. - Easy, I don't...

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:44.590
Get it right, Joppy.
Get it right!

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:48.845
There's a-a-a cabin. Th-Th-That's
all I know. There's a cabin.

01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:51.347
- Where is it?
- It's in Malibu, on Route Nine.

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:55.059
- Make a right turn at the alley.
- Oh, yeah.

01:20:58.062 --> 01:21:00.481
You sure this where
Albright's gonna be, right?

01:21:00.565 --> 01:21:02.316
- I guess so.
- Don't be guessin', Joppy.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:06.404
Look. He done this kind of thing
out there before, so I guess so.

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:09.365
What's got into you? I thought
y'all supposed to be friends.

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:12.493
- He killed Dupree's girlfriend Coretta.
- You lyin'.

01:21:12.577 --> 01:21:13.536
No.

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:15.580
- Son of a bitch!
- I done nothin' like that!

01:21:15.663 --> 01:21:18.833
No! No! Wait a minute!

01:21:18.916 --> 01:21:22.086
Hold on! We need him, Mouse!

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:24.297
The girl got $7,000!

01:21:27.008 --> 01:21:28.926
What?

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:32.388
The girl offered to pay me
$7,000 for them pictures.

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:34.390
Oh, my God.

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:37.059
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God!

01:21:37.143 --> 01:21:40.605
Oh, my God!

01:21:55.703 --> 01:21:57.747
How much further is it?

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.917
You're comin' up on it.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:22.396
Raymond, there's some
rope in the trunk. Tie him up.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.482
Yeah, all right.

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:33.783
Now, man, come on.

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:38.621
The girl is lyin' if she told
you I killed that woman.

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:40.998
- Who says she told me?
- I...

01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:43.542
I mean...

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:47.546
Easy, I was goin'
to shoot him now, okay?

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:49.548
No, don't shoot him.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:51.550
Don't shoot him.

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:37.763
Please!

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.521
Help me! Help me!

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:47.565
Help me.

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:53.946
Please!

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.948
Help me.

01:23:56.032 --> 01:23:58.242
- Please.
- Shut up!

01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:07.668
Now, you're gonna tell
me where the pictures are, okay?

01:24:07.752 --> 01:24:11.422
I don't wanna hurt you, but you are
gonna tell me. Where are the pictures?

01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:14.425
I don't have them.
Easy has them.

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.886
I thought you said he had
nothin' to do with it.

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:20.556
I was lying.

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:23.142
- What?
- I was lying.

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.312
Are you a liar?

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:30.357
Huh? Huh?
I know you're a liar.

01:24:30.441 --> 01:24:32.902
You lie about bein' a nigger?

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:34.904
Huh?

01:24:34.987 --> 01:24:38.157
Tell me the truth.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.040
What part of you is nigger?
Your leg a nigger?

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:44.538
Your arm a nigger?
Maybe your face is a nigger.

01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:49.919
What part of you
is nigger? Huh?

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:53.422
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- I don't know. Please.

01:24:53.506 --> 01:24:55.591
I'm gonna
burn it out of you.

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:59.887
No! No! No! No!

01:25:57.778 --> 01:25:59.697
Hey, Easy, is that you?

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:02.408
Hey, Easy!

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.410
Easy!

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:15.606
He gone, man.

01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:21.862
Gone.

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:32.665
You all right?

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.667
Y...

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:38.504
- Yeah.
- Can you walk? All right, come on. Let's go.

01:27:56.522 --> 01:27:59.108
Where's Joppy, Mouse?

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:01.568
Huh?

01:28:01.652 --> 01:28:03.779
Where's Joppy?

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.781
Uh, he right there.

01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:18.752
What happened?

01:28:18.836 --> 01:28:21.213
I ain't had no time
to be tyin' him up, Easy.

01:28:21.297 --> 01:28:22.798
What?

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:26.468
- Look, you just said don't shoot him, right?
- That's right.

01:28:26.552 --> 01:28:30.139
Well, I didn't.
I just... I... I choked him.

01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:33.309
- What?
- Well, how am I gonna help you out...

01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:36.270
if I'm back here
foolin' around with him, now?

01:28:39.398 --> 01:28:42.484
Easy, look, if you ain't wantin' him
killed, why'd you leave him with me?

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:51.744
Come on, we got to go, Easy.

01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:56.874
Easy, come on.
Let's go now.

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:16.060
All right, sweetheart.

01:29:16.143 --> 01:29:19.938
Listen, Easy. Think you gonna have
trouble with that dude Frank.

01:29:20.022 --> 01:29:22.399
I can just run by, kill him
and take that evenin' train.

01:29:22.483 --> 01:29:25.527
- No, Mouse.
- You sure? All right, then.

01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:30.699
- Hey.
- All right. Oh, look here.

01:29:30.783 --> 01:29:33.494
I cut you in for half, 'cause I
know you was too big a fool...

01:29:33.577 --> 01:29:35.621
to take your share from
that white girl yourself.

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.373
All right.
Hey, man. Look.

01:29:37.456 --> 01:29:40.292
If you need somebody to run them streets
with you again, just give me a call.

01:29:40.376 --> 01:29:45.089
'Cause you know how to put some
money in a nigger's pocket. Bye.

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:06.360
No, what upset them the most is
that <i>I</i> didn't tell them.

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:10.572
And then Terell threatened
to go public about my mother,

01:30:10.656 --> 01:30:12.908
and that just added
insult to injury.

01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:18.038
But when Todd sees the pictures there'll be nothin'
to stand in the way of us gettin' married.

01:30:18.122 --> 01:30:22.334
- You sure about that? - Of course.
Terell doesn't want to go to jail.

01:30:22.418 --> 01:30:24.586
I'm not talkin'
about Terell.

01:30:24.670 --> 01:30:28.257
Todd and I are very
much in love, and in the end...

01:30:30.384 --> 01:30:33.011
his family just wants him
to be happy.

01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:41.603
<i>Daphne had gotten the money
out of a locker at the YWCA.</i>

01:30:41.687 --> 01:30:44.690
<i>It was money she had gotten
from Carter's family.</i>

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:47.234
<i>$30,000...</i>

01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:49.570
<i>...to leave town.</i>

01:30:49.653 --> 01:30:52.948
<i>She was still convinced, though, that
her Negro blood didn't matter...</i>

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:57.619
<i>now that Terell couldn't use it to keep the man
she wanted to marry out of the mayor's race.</i>

01:30:57.703 --> 01:31:01.790
<i>She was in love and
couldn't see for dreamin'...</i>

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:04.835
<i>any better than
the rest of us, I guess.</i>

01:31:04.918 --> 01:31:08.380
<i>'Cause even though we had fought
a war to keep the world free,</i>

01:31:08.464 --> 01:31:10.466
<i>the color line in America
worked both ways,</i>

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:13.594
<i>and even a rich white man
like Todd Caner...</i>

01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:16.263
<i>was afraid to cross it.</i>

01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.724
- Don't walk away. Don't...
- Damn you.

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:20.726
Wait.

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:24.146
Wait.

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:28.734
Please!

01:31:29.735 --> 01:31:31.737
Please!

01:31:53.467 --> 01:31:56.678
Here's the $800
that I owe you.

01:31:56.762 --> 01:32:00.265
And thank you
for protecting her.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.685
You have some pictures.

01:32:15.614 --> 01:32:19.993
That puts you
back in the race.

01:32:20.077 --> 01:32:23.455
I'm gonna need you
to do something for me too.

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:29.503
I know. You'll have no
trouble with the police.

01:32:29.586 --> 01:32:31.547
That's a promise.

01:32:37.427 --> 01:32:40.013
Thank you.

01:32:42.057 --> 01:32:44.393
Mr. Rawlins.

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:47.938
Just so you know,

01:32:49.523 --> 01:32:51.400
I do love her.

01:33:36.987 --> 01:33:39.531
You want me
to walk you inside?

01:34:01.428 --> 01:34:03.597
<i>I dropped her off
at her brother's apartment,</i>

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.767
<i>a fourplex on Dinker Street.</i>

01:34:06.850 --> 01:34:11.480
<i>She had told me her story on the way
home like a sinner who wanted to confess.</i>

01:34:11.563 --> 01:34:14.983
<i>Her name was Ruby Hanks
from Lake Charles, Louisiana,</i>

01:34:15.067 --> 01:34:19.655
<i>and I suppose all she really
wanted was a place to fit in.</i>

01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:22.658
<i>A few days later my conscience
got the best of me,</i>

01:34:22.741 --> 01:34:25.994
<i>and I went by her place
to bring back my half of her money.</i>

01:34:26.078 --> 01:34:29.748
<i>I was kind of excited
about seein' her again.</i>

01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:34.419
<i>But when I got there, she and her
brother had picked up and gone.</i>

01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:18.004
Hey, Easy. Find a job yet?

01:35:18.088 --> 01:35:20.006
I ain't studyin'
no job, Odell.

01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:22.634
Ain't studyin' no job?
How you gonna live?

01:35:22.718 --> 01:35:25.887
I got a little money saved up.
Gonna invest in some real estate.

01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:28.265
Maybe go into business
for myself.

01:35:28.348 --> 01:35:32.686
- What kind of business?
- Little private investigatin'.

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:36.398
- You get in trouble doin' that.
- Yeah, well, like a man told me once,

01:35:36.481 --> 01:35:40.444
step out your door in the morning,
you're already in trouble.

01:35:40.527 --> 01:35:43.363
Just a matter of whether you're mixed
up at the top of that trouble.

01:35:43.447 --> 01:35:47.242
Yeah. I guess you're right.

01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:56.626
If you got a friend that you know does
bad things, I mean real bad things,

01:35:56.710 --> 01:36:00.672
can you still keep him as a friend
even though you know what he's like?

01:36:02.132 --> 01:36:04.342
You think that's wrong?

01:36:05.969 --> 01:36:07.846
All you got is your friends.

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:09.848
I will. Bye!

01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:12.184
Hey! Hey! Hey!
What are you doin'?

01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:14.186
You better get outta my yard.
You get on out!

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:17.939
Hey! Get on away from there! You know
that fool knocked down two of my trees?

01:36:18.023 --> 01:36:20.525
Get on away from there!

01:36:20.609 --> 01:36:22.527
You better get on!

01:36:25.363 --> 01:36:29.493
- You all right?
- Easy, is he crazy?

01:36:29.576 --> 01:36:33.538
Always up and down
on our street!

01:36:33.622 --> 01:36:35.582
If he comes back,
you let me know, ma'am.

01:36:35.665 --> 01:36:37.584
You take care.

01:36:43.924 --> 01:36:47.302
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey, man, get outta the street!

01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:49.262
Watch it.

01:36:58.897 --> 01:37:02.567
Look at the camera now.

01:37:02.651 --> 01:37:07.155
- Kathleen, give me some.
- Okay.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:18.583
<i>I thought about what
Odell had said about friends,</i>

01:37:18.667 --> 01:37:20.585
<i>and it made sense to me.</i>

01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:23.588
<i>Odell goes to church
every Sunday, so he would know.</i>

01:37:23.672 --> 01:37:26.174
<i>Later on, he challenged me
to a game of dominoes.</i>

01:37:26.258 --> 01:37:28.844
<i>Now, what'd he go
and do that for?</i>

01:37:28.927 --> 01:37:32.097
<i>We got to talkin' about Texas
and fooled around...</i>

01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:34.724
<i>and drunk almost' a quart'
of whiskey.</i>

01:37:34.808 --> 01:37:39.771
<i>And I forgot all about Daphne Monet,
Dewitt Albright, Carter and them.</i>

01:37:39.855 --> 01:37:41.857
<i>And I sat with my friend...</i>

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:44.150
<i>on my porch...</i>

01:37:44.234 --> 01:37:46.611
<i>at my house,</i>

01:37:46.695 --> 01:37:49.322
<i>and we laughed a long time.</i>

01:40:25.687 --> 01:40:29.274
<i>♪ I dreamed of
