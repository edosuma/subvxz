lf we're going to have any
further dealings with the Borg

30:31.204 --> 30:32.871
now or in the future,

30:33.039 --> 30:35.666
l think we should find out
all we can about them.

30:36.125 --> 30:39.962
- Visit the ship?
- ln my opinion, that's the only choice.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.716
- Assemble a minimal away team.
GUlNAN: What?

30:46.261 --> 30:49.972
Mr. Worf, Transporter Room 3.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.307
l wouldn't go there if l were you.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.227

30:55.395 --> 30:58.272
lt seems only fair
that we return the courtesy.

PlCARD:
Captain's log, supplemental.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.289
We have been attacked
without provocation by an alien race

31:15.456 --> 31:17.624
which Guinan calls the Borg.

31:17.792 --> 31:20.210
lt appears that we have neutralized
their vessel.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.462
Commander Riker
is leading an away team

31:22.630 --> 31:25.090
in an attempt
to learn more about them.

31:25.258 --> 31:27.926
There are no life sign readings.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.429
l've laid in coordinates
that should set you down

31:30.597 --> 31:33.307
in the least damaged section
of the Borg ship.

in case we need it.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.838
l wonder why they don't react to us.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.924
Or why the Enterprise didn't read
any life signs,

32:07.091 --> 32:08.926
especially with this many of them.

32:09.093 --> 32:13.055
Perhaps because the ship was being
scanned for individual life signs.

32:13.222 --> 32:14.765
Apparently,
when they are in these slots

32:14.933 --> 32:16.516
they become a part of the whole

32:16.684 --> 32:19.937
and no longer read
as separate life-forms.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.003

- Go ahead, Number One.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.464
RlKER:
Our readings were incorrect.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.257
The Borg crew survived.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.635
They appear to be
in some kind of stasis.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.596
PICARD: Explain.
- There are slots along the wall,

32:54.764 --> 32:55.806
kind of like compartments.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.307
There are two Borg in each one.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.226
Captain, l would theorize

32:59.394 --> 33:01.228
that the Borg
are somehow interconnected

33:01.396 --> 33:03.563
through these slots
and are working collectively.

33:03.731 --> 33:06.733
We're gonna try to access
their main computer.

33:16.703 --> 33:22.457
Commander, l believe each slot
is designed for a specific Borg.

Here is where
the connection is made.

33:29.590 --> 33:33.218
The technology required to achieve
this biological and artificial interface

33:33.386 --> 33:35.512
is far beyond our capabilities.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.932
- There are many advantages.
- Speed being the most obvious.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.477
This ship literally just thinks
what it wants and then it happens.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.329
PlCARD:
Describe it.

35:42.306 --> 35:46.685
From the look of it, the Borg
are born as a biological life-form.

35:47.061 --> 35:50.897
lt seems
that almost immediately after birth

35:51.065 --> 35:53.817
they begin artificial implants.

35:56.028 --> 35:58.071
Apparently the Borg
have developed the technology

35:58.573 --> 36:02.200
to link artificial intelligence
directly into the humanoid brain.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.788
Astounding.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.171
Commander?

36:20.386 --> 36:24.014
- What is it?
- The ship appears to be regenerating.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.309
Perhaps this explains why they
have not taken notice of our presence.

36:27.476 --> 36:29.102

is being directed

36:29.270 --> 36:30.979

to be using their combined power
