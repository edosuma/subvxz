NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:05.505
I went to Dr. Rose's office last night.

00:05.588 --> 00:08.174
He puts me in the chair,
and while I was under,

00:08.258 --> 00:09.926
I believe he took advantage of me.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.970
I can't believe they picked me
for this dentist undercover.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.263
There's nothing wrong with my teeth.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.598
-You mentioned 44,000?
-We're talking 44,

00:15.682 --> 00:17.517
-we're talking political steppingstone.
-When would you want me?

00:17.600 --> 00:20.270
-How long have you been an addict?
-Long time.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.439
-Mama?
-Don't be bothering yourself now.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.357
Maybe I'll see you
when you get out, all right?

00:24.441 --> 00:27.777
I got this judge to sign some papers
that make me your legal guardian.

00:30.071 --> 00:35.452
Item four...
after yesterday's unfortunate incidents,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.580
Mike Perez is on indefinite suspension.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.417
Pulatsi rides with Frain today
and until further notice.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.212
Oh, one more word about Mike Perez.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.923
Now, it's my guess
this poor guy was going around

00:49.007 --> 00:50.216
with a lot of pressure inside.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.302
The lid on the kettle never got raised,

00:52.385 --> 00:53.970
the pressure kept building up.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.638
That's N.G., people.

00:56.514 --> 00:57.974
You gotta let the pressure off.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.143
And for what it's worth, I hope you'd feel

01:00.226 --> 01:02.145
that Jablonski is a place
where you could do that,

01:03.354 --> 01:04.564
that Jablonski's here to listen.

01:05.857 --> 01:06.691
Ongoings...

01:08.359 --> 01:11.905
uh, Mike Belker is on an arson undercover
at the Dante project,

01:11.988 --> 01:14.824
and Mayo, Garibaldi, LaRue, and Washington

01:14.908 --> 01:17.327
continue out-of-precinct
on Operation Molar.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.246
-Hey, a pop today, folks?
-Camera's rolling, Sergeant.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.248
-Cute.
-Item six,

01:22.832 --> 01:26.669
as of this a.m., Andrew Renko
is your new PBA representative.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.838
(cheering, applauding)

01:29.422 --> 01:30.423
Thank you very much.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.759
Every redress will be handl--

01:32.842 --> 01:36.012
Item seven, the sign-up sheet
for the spring bowling league

01:36.096 --> 01:37.597
is on the board upstairs.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.475
You'll notice at the top of said sheet

01:41.017 --> 01:43.436
the John Hancock of yours truly,

01:43.520 --> 01:46.272
who, without giving
the tootsky to his own bugle,

01:46.356 --> 01:49.192
will admit to being the mainstay

01:49.275 --> 01:52.695
of the last year's league-victorious
Polk Avenue Kincoids.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.697
What do you say, folks?

01:54.989 --> 01:57.450
Let's have a top-notch
kegling group this year.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.703
Let's get out there,
let's bring home the hardware!

02:01.329 --> 02:02.163
Okay.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.790
Okay, that's it.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.750
Let's get out there, let's do it to th--

02:05.834 --> 02:07.043
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.004
I wanna say something about
the way I turn you out.

02:10.672 --> 02:14.134
When I say, "Let's do it to
them before they do it to us,"

02:14.217 --> 02:17.637
I'm saying, "Let's be
a good cop out there.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.474
Let's do our job before
the bad guys do theirs."

02:21.558 --> 02:23.476
'Cause it's damn sure
they're gonna be doing theirs.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.271
That's what I mean.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.149
That's the last time
I'm gonna say what I mean.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.985
I never meant,
"abridge a citizen's rights,"

02:32.068 --> 02:35.321
I never meant, "go trigger-happy,"
anything else.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.616
I'm 27 years with the force

02:38.700 --> 02:41.494
with great pride in
one discharge of a weapon,

02:41.578 --> 02:43.121
and that was in the air, thank God.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.082
Anyway, have a good shift.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.127
And with the aforementioned in mind,

02:49.210 --> 02:51.254
let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:51.337 --> 02:55.091
(indistinct conversations)

02:59.512 --> 03:00.638
Morning, Mrs. Furillo.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.850
Detectives, are you
gonna bust Dr. Rose today?

03:03.933 --> 03:05.602
-No pun intended.
-We hope so.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.770
Hey, that pervert's history, Mrs. Furillo.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.397
You know, the only good thing
I can say for the guy

03:09.480 --> 03:12.025
is he's got great taste in who he molests.

03:12.108 --> 03:15.195
-(sighs) You're a slug, Detective LaRue.
-Hey, pay a compliment.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.488
Well, it's very sweet of you to offer, Ma.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.157
I don't think it's a good idea, though.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.535
Because I'm a grown man,
and I have my own life,

03:22.619 --> 03:24.579
and I don't think
I should come live with you.

03:26.080 --> 03:26.915
Ma.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.125
Ma.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.127
Ma!

03:31.544 --> 03:34.923
We will talk about this later. In the me--
No, listen to me.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.842
I do not want you planning
I'm gonna move in, all right?

03:39.385 --> 03:40.220
Yes.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.057
I know the room's exactly how I left it.

03:44.140 --> 03:44.974
Leo.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.101
I gotta go, Ma.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.146
I love you, too. Goodbye.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.023
How is Mother Belker, Mick?

03:52.273 --> 03:53.608
They're knocking down my building.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.235
She wants me to move in with her.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.946
Oh, good. First impressions.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.656
Quick.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.324
It's a nice trailer.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.533
It's a recreational vehicle.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.661
Barring any glitches,
I'm taking ownership this morning.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.412
Great. It's nice.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.664
Use it in good health.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.667
Listen, if you're free for lunch,
I'd be delighted to have you come aboard.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.543
Huh? Listen, I'll tell you what,

04:12.627 --> 04:14.754
we could have lunch
and christen the galley.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.216
-What do you say?
-Yeah, I guess I could make it.

04:19.050 --> 04:19.884
HOWARD: Good for you, Mick.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.219
Ms. Davenport?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.096
When does the new job start?

04:23.429 --> 04:24.597
First thing Monday morning.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.849
My replacement, Connie Chapman--

04:27.433 --> 04:29.227
-Sergeant Lucy Bates.
-Sergeant.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.979
Connie. Good luck.
You're gonna need it up here.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.230
(chuckles) Thanks.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.982
-Sergeant, you got a minute?
-Yeah.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.694
-I'll be with you in a moment.
-See if I can promote a cup of coffee.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.284
I had a phone call yesterday
from Fabian's mother.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.202
She wants him back, Lucy.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.372
Tell her to forget about it. No way.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.875
She's looking for a lawyer.
I referred her to legal aid.

04:53.584 --> 04:56.129
What does she think, she can just waltz in
off the street between tricks

04:56.212 --> 04:58.256
and pick up Fabian away from me,
is that what she thinks?

04:58.339 --> 05:00.133
-Who does she think she is?
-Sergeant, please,

05:00.216 --> 05:01.217
don't kill the messenger.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.971
If I were you, I'd call Ruth Morganstern
at the youth authority.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.639
She can advise you better than I.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.974
Yeah, but can his mother really do this?

05:08.057 --> 05:09.809
I mean, can they really take Fabian
away from me?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.311
Lucy, I'd call right away.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.153
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:20.570 --> 05:22.238
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:22.322 --> 05:26.117
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:26.200 --> 05:27.827
(sirens waling)

05:33.249 --> 05:35.918
(theme music playing)

06:40.149 --> 06:42.735
(siren wailing)

07:03.506 --> 07:06.634
-Hit-and-run.
-I saw it! I saw the other car drive off!

07:06.717 --> 07:07.844
He went through that stop sign,

07:07.927 --> 07:09.804
-then hit this car!
-Tell me about it over here.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.014
(shouting)

07:12.098 --> 07:14.475
How are they? Are they gonna be all right?

07:14.559 --> 07:15.685
Just take it easy, sir.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.604
Are they all right? (crying) Shantell.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.022
Look over here, sir. Sir!

07:20.106 --> 07:24.068
Yeah, the first three letters,
"A," "X," "P."

07:24.152 --> 07:25.987
(voice breaking) That's all I saw.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.323
I didn't see anything else
except the man was white.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.366
She's dead.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.118
(sobs) They all are.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.872
BOBBY: Sir, just try
to take it easy, please.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.292
MAN: I saw him. He looked right at us.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.376
BOBBY: Okay. It's okay, sir.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.752
ANDY: Bobby Hill, Bobby Hill.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.546
-Jerome Simmons.
-How's his children?

07:45.798 --> 07:47.675
Bobby, if he owns this car
has got warrants,

07:47.758 --> 07:49.594
grand larceny and a bail jump.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.262
Registered to someone named Simmons?

07:51.345 --> 07:53.598
-"Jerome Simmons"?
-That's him.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.975
The guy loses his whole damn family.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.393
How are we supposed to bust him?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.521
Hey! Hey! Hey! Does he need
medical assistance?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.064
Well, he has head cuts,
maybe a concussion.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.733
-We ought to take him in for a look.
-Let's just get on it.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.277
-All right, get on it.
-My babies are my life.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.863
-Please don't tell me all my life is gone.
-Mr. Simmons,

08:08.946 --> 08:10.907
some warrants have fallen on you, sir.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.367
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to place you under arrest.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.911
I don't care about that.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.997
I just want to know if my babies are dead.

08:18.748 --> 08:19.749
Are they gone?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.084
Is Shantell gone?

08:23.252 --> 08:26.005
-Come on, let's get him up.
-Let's go! Let's just go!

08:27.340 --> 08:28.925
(crying) Oh, God.

08:30.927 --> 08:31.761
Take him in?

08:32.136 --> 08:34.639
JEROME: Oh, God, my family's gone.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.016
BOBBY: Renko, let's go.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.519
Renko!

08:44.941 --> 08:48.027
It's "G"-rated so far, Neal.
He's working on her mouth.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.738
Whoa-- whoa. Hold the phone.

08:51.113 --> 08:55.785
Oh, man, this guy is a sicko. Ooh.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.537
Biting the shoe?

08:57.620 --> 08:59.622
(chuckles) Yeah,
I guess that's what they mean by

08:59.705 --> 09:02.583
"a conscientiously applied program
of oral hygiene

09:02.667 --> 09:04.544
with regular professional care."

09:05.878 --> 09:08.089
-Let's take him.
-Wait, wait, wait. What for, man?

09:08.172 --> 09:09.840
Come on. What, molesting a shoe?

09:10.508 --> 09:11.467
Hold on.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.886
Wha-- Here. Here we go. Here it is.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.013
All right, northern migration. Uh-huh.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.183
One button, uh-huh. Two buttons.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.478
The blouse is open.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.689
-Uh-oh, he's in the rose garden.
-Come on, let's take him.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.982
Now, wait. Now, wait a minute.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.275
Seriously, Neal, I want to make sure
we got enough.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.443
-Hey, we got enough, J.D.
-Wait! Just wait. Oh--

09:30.152 --> 09:33.573
Oh, all right, all right. Hello, mama!

09:33.656 --> 09:34.949
All right, all right. Now, now, now.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.159
-Go to the mouth. Take him.
-Whoa!

09:37.577 --> 09:39.787
All right, police, you're busted.
Move away from her.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.456
-What's the meaning of this?
-You're under arrest, sexual battery.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.585
Battery? I... just massaging my patients.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.004
Save it, twisty,
the whole thing's on videotape.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.672
-DR. ROSE: I...
-Are you okay, Pats?

09:49.755 --> 09:51.299
-Mm-hmm.
-DR. ROSE: I wouldn't mean to harm her

09:51.382 --> 09:52.216
at all. I...

09:52.675 --> 09:56.053
Officer, nothing like this
will ever happen again.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.764
-You have my solemn promise.
-You got that right.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.601
Look, please, don't put me
through this right now.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.394
Hey, come on, Doc,
you got to use your feet.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.105
Theodore Rose, Leo.
Sexual battery, attempted rape.

10:06.397 --> 10:09.066
-LEO: Address?
-Picked him up at 6752 River Drive.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.902
-Need your residence, Doc.
-The disgusting Dr. Rose.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.071
Fay, there's a tremendous
mistake's taken place here.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.781
That's right, and you made it.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.450
I'm the one that fingered you, you creep.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.909
-You--
-Address, sir.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.787
It's 1317 Fenton Street.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.248
-That's Heather Hills.
-Good work, Neal.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.916
Ah, Mayo's the one who did great, Captain.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.711
So, what did you do to Detective Mayo?
Did you give her the gassy rope, too?

10:28.794 --> 10:30.087
-No, no.
-You all right?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.422
-FAY: You're a psychopath...
-Yeah, I think so.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.007
I think maybe she should lie down,
Captain.

10:33.090 --> 10:33.924
-No, no. I'll be okay.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.010
-Take an hour, Patsy.
-Come on.

10:36.093 --> 10:36.927
DR. ROSE: Please, Fay.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.805
Henry, let's get Rose's files.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.558
Track down his other female patients.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.561
See if any of them has a grievance,
maybe will come in and swear a complaint.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.064
-FAY: What'd he do to her?
-The usual things, Mrs. Furillo.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.857
Hey, hey, hey. Some not so usual.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.525
Have you checked your shoes, Mrs. Furillo?

10:51.609 --> 10:53.110
Are those the ones
you were wearing yesterday?

10:53.527 --> 10:56.322
(gasps) Bite marks?

10:56.405 --> 10:58.783
Oh, you-you filth!

10:58.866 --> 11:01.827
Leo! Leo, I'm gonna trade you cameras
for the VCR, all right?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.246
-I want to make sure this came out okay.
-The viewing room's empty.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.999
I'll be upstairs.
No one under 18 admitted.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.502
Captain, Heights just found

11:09.585 --> 11:11.879
that car from the hit-and-run
abandoned in an alley.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.131
-Forensics is going over it now.
-Registration?

11:14.215 --> 11:15.841
Carl Barnett. Suburban address.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.136
-He called it in stolen 8:30 this morning.
-Excuse me, Stan.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.888
ANDY: You'll have to stand
right here, Mr. Simmons.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.182
Sir, this is Mr. Jerome Simmons.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.643
Ah, Mr. Simmons, I'm Captain Furillo.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.604
I'm very sorry for your loss.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.400
-Mr. Simmons, come on in here.
-Captain, he saw the driver.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.984
-He's willing to give a statement.
-Good.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.277
How do you want to handle him from here?

11:35.569 --> 11:37.780
Warrants fell out, Bobby.
I can't help that.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.408
-Book him? Captain...
-Let him make any phone calls

11:40.491 --> 11:43.244
he has to make, and I'll ask the D.A.
how he wants to proceed.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.123
Dr. Rose?

11:48.124 --> 11:50.710
Yes, here I am... Dr. Molester.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.754
I'm Joyce Davenport, this is Ms. Chapman.

11:53.838 --> 11:54.672
How do you do?

11:55.172 --> 11:56.006
Doctor.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.301
Why did you request
a public defender, Doctor?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.053
I can't imagine you're indigent.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.304
Imagine? (sighs)

12:03.389 --> 12:07.143
(clicks tongue) The book on Dr. Ted Rose
is squarely into chapter 11.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.519
I see.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.895
No, I don't think you do.

12:09.979 --> 12:14.316
There's just no income...
can withstand an obsession.

12:15.943 --> 12:19.113
I mean, it's nothing for me anymore to...

12:20.656 --> 12:23.492
to go through four
or five dozen Capezios in a week.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.078
(snorts, coughs)

12:28.414 --> 12:31.417
I'm going to ask
the, uh, district attorney's office

12:31.500 --> 12:33.419
to let you be evaluated for probation

12:34.086 --> 12:35.629
in a psychiatric program, Doctor.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.630
Thank you. I...

12:36.714 --> 12:39.425
Could that mean that maybe
I wouldn't have to go to jail?

12:40.342 --> 12:41.594
We'll keep you apprised.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.972
Oh, I... want you to know...

12:47.600 --> 12:49.435
how hard and long...

12:49.518 --> 12:51.520
I've fought this thing and...

12:52.480 --> 12:56.150
I mean, I gave up a second-year
residency in podiatry because of this.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.861
(giggling) Oh, I'm sorry.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.113
You know, you got a lot of attitude, lady,

13:01.197 --> 13:03.491
for somebody with occluded bicuspids.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.746
Mr. Simmons, you're gonna stay
with Officer Renko and myself

13:08.829 --> 13:10.206
until you can be seen
by your public defender.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.791
We're not gonna put you
in a holding cell, sir.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.000
You can go out here in the squad room.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.336
Maybe you can use
the telephone to call somebody.

13:15.419 --> 13:18.339
-What for?
-I expect you have some people to call.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.257
I don't wanna call nobody.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.052
I just want you to take a gun
and shoot me in the head.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.805
Or let me shoot the person
that killed my family!

13:25.888 --> 13:28.098
-Mr. Simmons!
-I see him.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.518
I see my baby!

13:30.601 --> 13:32.645
Jerome! Jerome, listen!

13:33.938 --> 13:35.231
Who's there to call?

13:36.023 --> 13:37.900
Who's there to make the arrangements?

13:37.983 --> 13:41.654
She... she got people.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.406
Okay, okay. Let's just go call them.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.202
Come on now.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.079
Excuse me?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.623
Ah, Ruth Morganstern, youth authority.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.166
Sergeant Bates is expecting you.

13:55.125 --> 13:55.960
Thank you.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.503
Right. Thanks.

13:57.962 --> 14:01.090
Stolen car's owner is on his way over
from the Heights to pick up his 802s.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.341
Put Simmons downstairs.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.676
I don't want them bumping into each other.

14:03.759 --> 14:04.593
Right.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.471
Forensics brought this in
from the Cadillac, Captain.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.806
Somebody's brown-bagging it.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.100
Bottle of scotch, empty.
Some kind of a scarf.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.685
Henry, put the scarf in property,

14:12.768 --> 14:15.145
dust the bottle for prints,
and run the car owner's sheet.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.647
-Right away.
-Forensics said the car

14:16.730 --> 14:18.315
must've been doing 40 miles an hour.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.485
What kind of a guy takes out
a family then drives away?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.779
She's completed the rehab program.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.364
She's secured a place to live.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.117
She's working nights
in a downtown office building.

14:28.617 --> 14:30.286
She is apparently off drugs for good.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.704
You bet your life savings on that?

14:32.663 --> 14:34.373
No, but she's the boy's mother.

14:34.790 --> 14:35.958
The court would lean heavily

14:36.041 --> 14:38.043
towards placing him
with his natural parent.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.712
And what if I want to fight it?

14:41.088 --> 14:42.965
Well, a separate action
to have her declared unfit

14:43.048 --> 14:45.801
would take an attorney,
could drag on months,

14:45.885 --> 14:47.970
and you'd be out-of-pocket
several thousand at a minimum.

14:48.679 --> 14:49.638
So what?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.142
I feel like I'm fighting for his life.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.977
I can't tell you what to do, Sergeant.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.520
But I can ask you,

14:56.604 --> 14:58.856
if you care about Fabian
as much as I think you do,

14:58.939 --> 15:02.651
what good can possibly come from a bitter
and protracted legal fight

15:02.735 --> 15:05.279
between the only two people
who ever really cared about him?

15:09.491 --> 15:10.326
What she say?

15:10.951 --> 15:13.704
Uh, that there would be a big court battle

15:14.163 --> 15:16.582
that would cost a lot of money,
which I can't afford...

15:18.167 --> 15:19.710
and I'd probably lose him anyway.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.546
Hey, look, Luce,

15:22.630 --> 15:24.340
I could give you a couple of thou,

15:24.882 --> 15:25.799
I mean, if that would help.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.927
I got that money from Vegas.
I didn't do anything with it.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.720
That's very sweet of you. Thank you.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.474
I mean it, Luce, anything you need,
anything at all.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.101
Uh...

15:37.144 --> 15:38.562
I'm gonna lose him, Joe.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.773
And...

15:41.982 --> 15:44.109
You know, I've only had him two months...

15:46.987 --> 15:50.032
and I can't remember
what my life was like before.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.618
Hey.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.581
It's okay. It's okay.

16:01.877 --> 16:05.714
I had some last concern
about manageability in city traffic.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.758
Well, that vehicle is ultra manageable,
Lieutenant.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.301
It's a pleasure to drive.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.762
As well as gasoline consumption--

16:11.845 --> 16:14.765
It's not-It's not a Civic.
I can't lie to you.

16:14.848 --> 16:15.849
On the other hand,

16:16.767 --> 16:18.727
I think we know we're not
gonna be fooled anymore

16:18.811 --> 16:22.398
by guys in bedsheets yelling "crisis"
and, and, and trying to blackmail

16:22.481 --> 16:24.775
the greatest nation
on the face of this Earth.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.403
'Cause listen... I'm not saying
it's gonna be cheap,

16:28.112 --> 16:30.155
but fuel is going to be plentiful.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.117
It's going to be available
to you as the consumer

16:33.200 --> 16:36.036
because we're not gonna put up
with that malarkey anymore.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.873
WOMAN (on P.A.):<i> Mr. Cohen,</i>
<i>phone call, line three.</i>

16:40.374 --> 16:42.292
Yes, well, uh...

16:42.376 --> 16:46.255
Lieutenant, (chuckles)
how do I stand with you?

16:46.338 --> 16:48.841
I mean, last Tuesday,
you walked off of this lot,

16:48.924 --> 16:49.883
I thought we had a sale.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.468
I went-- I filled out all the papers
and everything else--

16:51.552 --> 16:53.178
Well, to be perfectly candid,

16:53.262 --> 16:58.142
I intend to drive off
of your lot today in this vehicle.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.602
You do? Good for you.

17:01.228 --> 17:04.148
'Cause I have a check in my pocket

17:04.523 --> 17:05.983
in the amount that we discussed.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.151
You've got a check. That's good.

17:09.445 --> 17:13.157
It's just that I had this last little...

17:14.033 --> 17:15.617
twinge of uncertainty.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.871
(chuckles) Which you would not be
an intelligent buyer if you didn't have.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.082
Lieutenant, what brought you here?

17:22.499 --> 17:24.084
A patrol unit dropped me off.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.545
No, no, no. I'm saying
in point of original interest,

17:26.628 --> 17:28.005
uh, why did you come to this lot?

17:28.797 --> 17:32.092
Well, I was interested
in buying a mobile home.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.429
And is this the unit that caught
your eye, your attention?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.139
Correct.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.268
In other words, what I see here

17:41.852 --> 17:43.771
is an adult with a legitimate desire.

17:43.854 --> 17:47.149
And I see an opportunity
to fulfill that desire.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.818
Wait, wait. I'm not gonna get all
"Little House on the Prairie" on you,

17:50.611 --> 17:52.404
(sighs) but that's the reason

17:52.488 --> 17:55.199
Maurice Farnsworth is in this business,
is to put those things together.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.533
Now here's what I want you to do...

17:57.076 --> 17:58.786
I want you to sign these papers,

17:59.244 --> 18:00.496
I want you to give me that check,

18:00.788 --> 18:04.666
and I want you to get in
that unit, you R.V. owner!

18:08.629 --> 18:09.838
(chuckles)

18:10.255 --> 18:11.298
My golly...

18:12.966 --> 18:14.051
I'm gonna do it.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.678
Good for you. Go for it!

18:18.889 --> 18:20.432
Oh, Judas.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.939
You know, it was just that
last little bit of worry

18:27.272 --> 18:29.983
about city driving and parking.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.026
No problem.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.487
Can I have the, uh, check, please?

18:34.905 --> 18:37.241
She ought to fire right up.
Put a gallon in last night.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.080
What a guy.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.416
-How do you feel?
-Like a million dollars.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.001
That's just for the interest.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.962
-Oh! Only kidding.
-(both chuckles)

18:50.045 --> 18:51.380
Just showing you a good time.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.715
You ever drive one of these babies before?

18:53.799 --> 18:56.760
Oh, sir, I have driven a tank
in my country's service.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.513
-Say no more.
-Yeah.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.224
Bon voyage, Lieutenant.

19:21.118 --> 19:21.952
Yeah.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.745
(whistling)

19:24.163 --> 19:26.081
-LUCY: Mrs. Dewitt?
-(baby crying)

19:26.165 --> 19:27.374
(knock on door)

19:31.211 --> 19:32.254
What do you want?

19:33.213 --> 19:34.339
I'm Lucy Bates.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.966
I've been taking care of Fabian.

19:36.758 --> 19:40.637
I know who you are. I ask what you want?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.473
If you just let me in,
maybe we can talk about that.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.393
I'm clean.

19:47.019 --> 19:47.853
I know that.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.772
Please, let me in.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.694
(locks jangling)

20:01.909 --> 20:03.202
Why didn't you come to me first?

20:03.660 --> 20:05.454
You got your police friends.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.664
Maybe you even know the judge,

20:07.748 --> 20:11.084
and maybe you try and frame me up
and send me back to jail.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.711
Nobody is trying to frame you.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.380
Cops done worse than that to me.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.092
Mrs. Dewitt...

20:22.012 --> 20:23.388
I know you love Fabian.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.058
I'm asking you to consider
what's best for him.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.978
What's best for him
is to be with his mama.

20:33.023 --> 20:36.151
I have given him the first stable home
he's ever had in his life.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.780
He's doing real well at school,
and he's got his friends.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.325
If you love him,
realize what he's got now.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.078
He don't have his mother.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.621
Now, which mother are we talking about?

20:47.704 --> 20:48.914
The one that's been a junkie all her life,

20:48.997 --> 20:50.958
or the one that's been clean
for a couple weeks?

20:51.708 --> 20:53.919
Forty six days, lady!

20:54.002 --> 20:56.296
And each one of them because of
that boy and what he mean to me.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.674
Now, I don't have to explain
myself to you!

21:01.176 --> 21:03.428
I'm... I'm grateful for what you've done,

21:04.137 --> 21:06.723
but it's time for me
to get my family back together.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.811
What kind of family life you gonna have
working nights as a cleaning woman?

21:13.438 --> 21:16.733
I am working the only honest job
I can get!

21:17.109 --> 21:20.529
-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
-You gonna make me come get my boy,

21:20.612 --> 21:22.531
or you gonna do the right thing?

21:27.744 --> 21:30.706
I'll have to ask Fabian that.
He's gonna have to choose.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.750
Blood don't choose, miss.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.628
Blood just is, and he's mine.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.507
Frank, they just finished a canvas

21:40.590 --> 21:42.301
of the accident scene
for additional witnesses.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.052
No better description
of the hit-and-run driver.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.304
-Thanks, Henry.
-Barnett,

21:45.387 --> 21:46.722
the guy who reported the car stolen,

21:46.805 --> 21:49.558
-has three drunk drivings on his BCI.
-Is that right?

21:49.641 --> 21:51.518
Also a disorderly conduct

21:51.601 --> 21:54.271
pleaded down from solicitation
at 95th and Market.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.605
Okay, I want to question him
when he gets in.

21:55.689 --> 21:56.732
-All right.
-Excuse me, Lieutenant?

21:56.815 --> 21:58.734
Ah... patient of Dr. Rose is here.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.948
-Uh, thanks.
-Frank? Frank?

22:05.365 --> 22:08.994
Forensics could not lift usable prints
from the stolen Cadillac.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.163
-That hit-and-run tragedy?
-Yes, sir.

22:11.246 --> 22:12.956
-Chief.
-I was just in the Heights.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.417
They tell me we locked up
the surviving father.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.668
Mm-hmm, when warrants fell.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.004
Excuse me a second, will you, Ray?

22:19.546 --> 22:20.589
Of course, Chief.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.342
What kind of warrants?

22:23.633 --> 22:27.012
Well, a year-old larceny charge
and a bail violation.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.221
How bad was the larceny?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.516
Entering. No violence.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.479
Frank, I don't see what good's
to be served pursuing those.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.690
Man gets his family wiped out,
we throw him in the hoosegow.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.192
They'd love it on the 5 o'clock news.

22:40.275 --> 22:41.693
Well, I talked to Irwin Bernstein.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.862
He's not inclined
to come down hard on Simmons.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.073
Good. Good for Irwin.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.616
We gonna make the hit-and-run?

22:48.200 --> 22:49.368
Too early to tell.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.036
Your whole family buys it.
It's gotta hurt.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.454
We'll keep you posted.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.415
You know, since Cora and I split up,

22:56.416 --> 22:58.293
I've gotten a lot more
in touch with my feelings.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.464
Leo! You want to see how bent
the world is?

23:02.547 --> 23:04.800
You take a look at this tape
of Mayo with Dr. Bing-Bong.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.218
I can't believe
what some guys will do for--

23:06.301 --> 23:08.637
You review the tape, J.D.,
or are you selling tickets?

23:10.138 --> 23:12.307
Well, I had to make sure we got
enough to prosecute, didn't I?

23:12.933 --> 23:14.226
Yeah? I want to see it.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.145
Or is viewing time all booked up
for fraternity-row screenings?

23:17.229 --> 23:20.649
Hey, you take a look at the tape
before you cop an attitude, Patsy.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.610
I mean, this guy Rose
is over the left-field fence.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.570
(scoffs) Chicks today.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.322
Zero sense of humor.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.200
Congratulations on that
Dr. Hoof and Mouth, Detective.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.118
Thank you, sir.

23:31.618 --> 23:32.828
Was that our decoy?

23:33.203 --> 23:35.247
Right, sir. Detective Mayo.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.957
Great set of wheels, huh? (clicks tongue)

23:37.666 --> 23:38.917
Guy went out in style.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.460
Yes, sir.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.297
Excuse me.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.926
My name is Carl Barnett.
My car was stolen this morning?

23:48.009 --> 23:49.636
Right. Would you come with me, sir?

23:49.719 --> 23:52.389
Actually, I just need the theft reports
for my insurance carrier.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.891
-Yeah, just come with me, sir.
-Why?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.685
-Captain wants to see you.
-Okay.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.854
Thank you. I appreciate your coming up.

23:59.312 --> 24:02.149
You know, 120 dollar pair of pumps ruined.

24:02.232 --> 24:03.692
And I thought I had mice.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.112
When did you first notice that your car
was missing, Mr. Barnett?

24:07.529 --> 24:11.950
Uh, we'd slept in.
I came downstairs around 8:15.

24:12.033 --> 24:14.453
They'd broken into the garage.
I called the police right away.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.122
-8:28.
-That sounds right.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.666
You say they were all killed?
There were no survivors?

24:19.749 --> 24:20.625
There was one survivor.

24:20.917 --> 24:22.711
Was anybody in the house
with you, Mr. Barnett?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.297
-My wife.
-She'll verify that?

24:25.755 --> 24:27.591
We were together since 6:00 last night.

24:27.674 --> 24:30.635
-Look, is there a problem?
-Well, you have an arrest sheet here.

24:31.178 --> 24:32.637
Conviction for disorderly conduct,

24:32.721 --> 24:35.056
which began as solicitation
of an undercover policewoman

24:35.140 --> 24:37.309
at 95th and Market Streets last April.

24:37.684 --> 24:39.311
What's that got to do
with the price of eggs?

24:39.561 --> 24:42.314
You also have a history of arrests
for driving while impaired.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.941
My drinking problem
is under control, Captain.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.903
I've been in a program, and I happen
to be managing very effectively.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.405
-Not that I follow--
-Which makes you a drunk driver

24:50.489 --> 24:53.825
who's been arrested in the accident's
general area in the past.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.036
What the hell has my past
got to do with this, Captain?

24:56.119 --> 24:58.288
-My car was stolen!
-So you said.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.165
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to ask you some more questions,

25:00.248 --> 25:02.292
-Mr. Barnett.
-This is extraordinary.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.210
Given your attitude,

25:03.293 --> 25:04.920
I'm not sure I'm inclined
to answer more questions.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.087
Then I'm afraid we'll have to insist.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.422
Then I'm afraid
I'm gonna contact my lawyer!

25:07.506 --> 25:08.673
You certainly have that option.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.301
Ray, would you show
Mr. Barnett to interrogation?

25:11.384 --> 25:12.427
Wha-- Hold on.

25:13.637 --> 25:14.471
Hold on a second.

25:16.306 --> 25:19.226
Look, I'm afraid I have a temper.

25:19.684 --> 25:23.355
I, uh, I'm sure you have
to ask these questions.

25:23.647 --> 25:24.940
I think I should contact my lawyer,

25:25.023 --> 25:28.735
-but I'll try to be cooperative.
-Good.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.157
Under the circumstances,

25:34.241 --> 25:36.326
if you were to enter a plea of guilty,

25:36.618 --> 25:39.579
I'd think we could get you
probation and immediate release.

25:42.123 --> 25:43.208
Mr. Simmons?

25:44.793 --> 25:46.086
However you want to do.

25:51.925 --> 25:54.469
I can only imagine the pain
you must be feeling now.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.473
What I would like to do is help you
dispose of these other matters

25:58.557 --> 25:59.891
so you can bury your dead.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.726
Miss Davenport,
we're putting together a lineup.

26:01.810 --> 26:05.272
-We'd like your client to view it.
-A lineup? For who?

26:06.523 --> 26:09.067
I presume they've got a suspect
in the hit-and-run accident.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.236
Let's go.

26:11.945 --> 26:12.988
I want to see him.

26:13.863 --> 26:14.990
Let's go.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.744
I'm Phillip Potter,
representing Carl Barnett.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.621
Ah, Captain Furillo, Counselor.
Have a seat.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.331
Your client decided
to go ahead without you.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.458
RAY: Take your marks.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.549
All the way to the end.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.509
Lift your head, number four.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.137
Face front.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.432
Murderer! Murderer!

26:40.515 --> 26:41.600
Murderer!

26:44.102 --> 26:47.772
-Murderer! Murderer!
-(all shouting)

26:47.856 --> 26:51.151
Get him away from me!
Get him away from me!

26:51.735 --> 26:52.736
Get him off me!

26:53.445 --> 26:58.325
(crying) My eyes!

26:58.408 --> 27:00.869
I see my babies!

27:01.786 --> 27:02.621
Jerome!

27:10.962 --> 27:12.547
The only drawback is the parking, Mick.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.467
I'm lucky this lot is within
hailing distance of my building.

27:15.550 --> 27:16.384
Uh-huh.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.521
Here you go, Mick.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.399
Ahh.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.821
Yes, strong and content...

27:37.447 --> 27:40.825
I travel the open road going where I list.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.788
I'm my own master, absolute and total.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.248
I got to find an apartment.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.502
You know, I've decided to name it Pegasus.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.421
Pegasus, Mick. Pegasus for freedom.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.006
Pegasus for chosen flight.

27:55.090 --> 27:58.593
I didn't look before because I thought
I was moving in with somebody.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.720
Mm. Oh, yes.

28:01.262 --> 28:03.098
The fair Tataglia, hmm?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.225
You won't believe this, Mick,

28:05.308 --> 28:07.769
but do you know what I think
of when I blow the horn?

28:08.645 --> 28:09.896
A riverboat captain.

28:10.397 --> 28:13.066
-(clanging)
-I think of myself on the Mississippi.

28:36.047 --> 28:36.881
You there...

28:43.179 --> 28:44.639
What do you want, man?

28:45.473 --> 28:49.394
It would behoove you to inscribe
this vehicle in your memory.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.229
It belongs to a police officer.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.566
-A cop, huh?
-A cop. Correct.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.109
Myself, in fact.

28:56.443 --> 28:59.654
And I don't wish to see you in proximity
of the Pegasus again.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.572
Now scat.

29:01.406 --> 29:05.994
Do you mind if I get my jack back, Jack?

29:07.871 --> 29:10.498
Well, I certainly don't want
my R.V. on a tilt. Be quick.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.502
Big man. A lot of big words.

29:20.884 --> 29:23.094
Sir, our lunch is getting cold.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.722
Well, that's too bad, big words,

29:25.805 --> 29:28.516
because you live around here,
everything is cold.

29:29.142 --> 29:32.520
Maybe I could arrange
a warm jail cell for you.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.982
And maybe I could arrange
a few flat tires for you.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.864
Did you say you're gonna park this here?

29:46.201 --> 29:50.038
Uh, Counselor, I'm Phillip Potter,
counselor representing Carl Barnett.

29:50.121 --> 29:53.583
I was wondering if I might have
a brief word with your client. I mean...

29:53.666 --> 29:56.127
My client's identification was clear,
Mr. Potter.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.087
If your intention's to shift blame here...

29:58.171 --> 29:59.631
No, it's not our intention at all.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.883
I simply wanted to speak with Mr. Simmons,

30:01.966 --> 30:04.219
discuss the area of potential liability.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.346
-Well, I'll ask him.
-Many thanks.

30:06.429 --> 30:07.931
What the hell's going on
in the viewing room?

30:08.014 --> 30:09.891
-What's the problem?
-The problem is there's three guys

30:09.974 --> 30:11.684
up there watching
the tape of my undercover.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.228
What you do, charge 50 cents a head?

30:13.311 --> 30:14.979
Hey, I showed a couple
of guys the tape, Pats.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.439
There's few enough laughs around here.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.399
Oh, forget keeping evidence secure.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.443
Didn't you ever hear of common decency?

30:20.527 --> 30:22.695
Hey, would you keep your... your shirt on?

30:22.779 --> 30:23.822
Oh, you're a jerk, LaRue.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.990
You're as bad as the creep we busted.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.409
Hey, what are you gonna do, Pats?
Are you gonna hit me?

30:28.493 --> 30:30.829
-Hey! Hey!
-Patsy! Patsy! In my office.

30:32.831 --> 30:33.957
-HARRY: Hey, J.D.
-What?

30:34.040 --> 30:35.375
What're you doing?
You're showing Mayo's tape?

30:35.458 --> 30:36.584
Yeah, Harry, I showed the tape.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.877
You're with the legion of decency, too?

30:37.961 --> 30:39.462
No, I'm somebody who might
take your head off!

30:39.546 --> 30:41.172
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

30:41.256 --> 30:43.716
Hey, Harry, chill out, man,
and you zip it up.

30:46.761 --> 30:47.971
-What do you want to do?
-PATSY: I don't know.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.932
I mean, we're cops together.
What is the guy's problem?

30:51.015 --> 30:53.434
He has an emotional age of around nine.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.311
You know, I think he even
let the camera shoot longer

30:55.395 --> 30:56.437
than he needed to.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.939
Well, that part's debatable, Patsy.

30:58.231 --> 31:00.024
But if you want to file
a grievance against LaRue,

31:00.108 --> 31:02.694
for making a peepshow
out of the evidence, I'll support you.

31:04.821 --> 31:05.655
Thanks, Captain.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.574
-I... think ought to handle it myself.
-(knock on door)

31:08.157 --> 31:09.325
Captain, there's something
you ought to hear.

31:16.332 --> 31:19.419
I'm saying I wasn't sure that was the man.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.547
I decided I wasn't sure.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.340
You were damn sure
about an hour ago, Jerome.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.550
You wanted to kill Barnett.

31:26.384 --> 31:27.802
I'm telling you what I decided.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
Just a case of mistaken identity, huh?

31:31.681 --> 31:32.515
That's right.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.727
Jerome... we know Barnett's
lawyer talked to you.

31:36.102 --> 31:36.936
So what?

31:37.270 --> 31:39.272
So maybe he helped you change your mind.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.817
You want another lineup?
You want to see him again?

31:43.985 --> 31:47.155
No. I don't want to see him.

31:47.572 --> 31:48.948
-Jerome, don't--
-Come on, Ray.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.751
Frank, he betrays his own family.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.461
-What else do we have?
-Not much.

32:01.544 --> 32:04.422
Barnett's wife is here. I'm sure
her statement will support her husband.

32:04.505 --> 32:08.176
Will you listen to this? Officer Hill
has just talked the Williams funeral home

32:08.259 --> 32:11.137
into giving all their services
free of charge to Simmons' family.

32:11.220 --> 32:13.431
Simmons just withdrew his identification.

32:13.806 --> 32:14.891
-You're kidding.
-Andy, get me the scarf

32:14.974 --> 32:16.935
we found in Barnett's car.
I want to show it to his wife.

32:18.686 --> 32:21.147
Take it easy. Take it easy!

32:25.735 --> 32:29.280
How much did he give you, Jerome,
to make you change your mind, hmm?

32:30.448 --> 32:33.618
Who are you? Where do you
get off asking me that?

32:33.701 --> 32:36.120
That was your family that died
out in the street, man.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.082
-You can't accept money.
-Don't tell me what I can't do.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.584
I got to take my eyes out.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.295
I've got to take out
seeing them on the street.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.047
Blood money won't help you do that!

32:48.591 --> 32:51.302
Jerome, this just isn't right.

32:51.886 --> 32:53.262
If there's a right and wrong,

32:53.846 --> 32:55.932
you think I'm alive and them getting cold?

32:57.058 --> 32:59.143
As good as she was, as weak as I am?

33:00.103 --> 33:02.230
As beautiful as those little babies was?

33:03.731 --> 33:06.484
You get out of here. Just leave me alone.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.237
I'll tell you one thing.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.073
I don't believe you love them
as much as you say.

33:13.574 --> 33:14.534
You get out of here!

33:14.617 --> 33:17.578
If you loved them, you couldn't do this.
You wouldn't.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.831
You wouldn't let that man
Barnett back on the street

33:19.914 --> 33:21.457
again to kill another man's family.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.167
-You get out of here!
-You hear me?

33:23.751 --> 33:25.044
You hear me, Jerome?

33:25.795 --> 33:27.839
You can stay as high as you want,

33:27.922 --> 33:29.465
but don't say that you loved them!

33:30.383 --> 33:31.634
Get him out of here!

33:33.386 --> 33:34.220
Bobby.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.975
-I'm done.
-(siren wailing)

33:42.854 --> 33:44.564
MRS. BARNETT:
He was with me all last night

33:44.647 --> 33:46.190
from early evening until this morning

33:46.274 --> 33:48.401
when he discovered his car
had been stolen.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.657
-Is that your scarf, Mrs. Barnett?
-No.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.868
It was found in your husband's
car this morning.

33:57.493 --> 33:58.995
I suppose it might be mine,

34:00.830 --> 34:02.874
or it might belong
to whoever stole the car,

34:02.957 --> 34:04.751
someone who was in the car
after it was stolen.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.086
I don't think your husband
was with you last night.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.715
I think he was out cruising, drunk.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.760
And on the way home this morning,

34:14.844 --> 34:17.764
he hit and killed a woman
and two little children.

34:17.847 --> 34:18.681
No.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.142
Then he drove a couple of blocks further,

34:21.225 --> 34:23.728
abandoned the car, took a gypsy cab home,

34:23.811 --> 34:26.064
called and reported
the car had been stolen.

34:26.981 --> 34:29.067
That's a cruel thing to say
to me, and it's not true.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.152
And I think you're going
through hell right now,

34:31.235 --> 34:33.321
because you know
you're covering up for a killer.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.203
Captain, I'm a mother.

34:41.412 --> 34:42.246
I feel ver--

34:43.790 --> 34:46.209
I'm very sorry for what happened
to that family.

34:47.376 --> 34:48.461
You're also a wife.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.052
JOE (on P.A.): You with the blue jacket.
Yeah, you. Stop right there.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.637
- Pull over to the side.
-(siren wails)

34:58.387 --> 35:00.181
No funny things with your books either.

35:01.849 --> 35:02.683
Pull over.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.480
Not so fast, pal. Not so fast.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.023
Assume the position.
Get your hands up in the air.

35:09.649 --> 35:11.067
-How you doing, Fabian?
-Hey, Joe.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.778
How you doing? Will you do me a favor?

35:13.861 --> 35:15.029
Sit in the car and keep my seat warm.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.405
If I don't get a doughnut, I'm gonna die.

35:16.489 --> 35:17.532
And watch that lady in there.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.455
-Hi, Fabe.
-Hey, Luce. What's going on?

35:25.039 --> 35:25.873
Not much.

35:27.041 --> 35:29.127
Lucy, you're America's worst damn liar.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.712
-Watch that language.
-I'm sorry.

35:32.922 --> 35:33.881
So here's the deal.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.093
Your mom is done with the rehab program,

35:37.510 --> 35:39.554
she's off drugs, she got a job,

35:40.096 --> 35:41.472
and now she wants you
to come home with her.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.391
She wants me back?

35:43.808 --> 35:44.642
Yeah.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.646
-She's really off the drugs?
-So far, yeah.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.817
But what if she goes back on them?
Then what?

35:53.317 --> 35:54.527
What about school?

35:55.194 --> 35:56.529
I was sort of getting into it.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.698
You got to go to school,
Fabian, that's the law.

36:01.534 --> 36:02.368
Damn!

36:04.203 --> 36:05.037
Hey!

36:08.124 --> 36:08.958
Hey!

36:12.211 --> 36:13.838
Hey, wait up!

36:15.882 --> 36:17.216
Will you talk to me?

36:17.550 --> 36:19.886
If you don't want to go back,
you just say so, I'll fight it.

36:19.969 --> 36:23.014
Of course I want to go back.
I love my mom. She needs me.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.640
And what about what you need?

36:25.057 --> 36:26.601
You should think about that for a change.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.144
It ain't that simple.

36:30.438 --> 36:31.522
I'm going back.

36:32.857 --> 36:33.691
Okay.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.110
You mad at me?

36:38.404 --> 36:39.614
How can I be mad at you?

36:40.615 --> 36:41.699
I love you.

36:42.658 --> 36:43.701
I love you, too.

36:47.914 --> 36:51.542
Well, if anything goes wrong,
you know you got a room at my place.

37:11.562 --> 37:16.108
Acceptances for Dr. Rose
into three psychiatric programs,

37:16.192 --> 37:18.527
that's not bad
for a last day's work, Counselor.

37:19.153 --> 37:19.987
Acceptable?

37:20.655 --> 37:22.949
For purposes of evaluation, yeah.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.868
As an alternative to incarceration...

37:26.827 --> 37:27.995
No, no, no, no.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.332
Uh, let's see what
the reports have to say.

37:34.919 --> 37:38.923
I understand you used gas
only on female adult patients, Doctor.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.259
I'm deeply ashamed, Your Honor.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.594
I'm turning my entire practice
over to my associate

37:43.678 --> 37:46.931
Dr. Cranson until I've completed
psychological rehabilitation.

37:47.014 --> 37:50.601
I'm also planning a trip to Israel
to do charity work in a kibbutz.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.103
(snickering)

37:56.107 --> 37:57.858
Don't book passage tonight.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.194
Tonight, it's the pokey.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.530
You deserve a taste anyway.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.824
Hundred thousand cash or bond.

38:04.907 --> 38:06.701
Short date for probation report.

38:06.784 --> 38:07.785
(gavel bangs)

38:09.704 --> 38:11.789
BAILIFF: Recess will be called
after two more cases.

38:12.748 --> 38:14.625
Anyone here not on court business...

38:14.709 --> 38:17.169
Nothing. If a girl was with Barnett,
we couldn't find her.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.839
You want to hold Simmons in a few days?

38:19.922 --> 38:21.340
See if his memory gets back on track?

38:21.424 --> 38:23.050
So when he gets out he can recant again?

38:23.134 --> 38:25.052
Detective McConnell, Division.

38:25.845 --> 38:29.890
The chief's office would like
to see the evidence in the Rose case.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.559
Forty nine on the calendar,
Jerome Simmons,

38:31.642 --> 38:33.477
grand larceny and failure to appear.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.063
JUDGE: All right, what have we got here?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.816
This is the individual
who lost his family, Your Honor.

38:38.899 --> 38:39.775
JUDGE: Oh, yeah.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.070
BAILIFF: Year-old charges.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.657
JUDGE: You have any problems
with R.O.R., Mr. Bernstein?

38:48.784 --> 38:49.827
No, Your Honor.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.078
Mr. Simmons?

38:53.831 --> 38:54.832
If I release you today,

38:55.249 --> 38:57.001
are you going to return
for your hearing date?

38:57.626 --> 38:58.461
Yes, Your Honor.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.172
Release on recognizance.

39:01.255 --> 39:02.673
You're free to go, Mr. Simmons.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.594
-I'm sorry for your loss.
-Okay.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.222
BAILIFF: Carl Barnett,
three counts vehicular manslaughter.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.432
Unsigned complaint...

39:11.515 --> 39:13.726
-Sit down.
-They're done with me.

39:13.809 --> 39:16.103
Watch. Watch what you did. Sit.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.315
Your Honor, my client
has a preliminary statement.

39:19.398 --> 39:20.232
JUDGE: Okay.

39:21.817 --> 39:24.445
What happened this morning,
Your Honor, was a deep tragedy

39:24.528 --> 39:26.947
for the family of Jerome Simmons.

39:27.698 --> 39:30.701
But I'm also concerned
with the gestapo police tactics

39:30.785 --> 39:32.953
which have caused needless
emotional trauma

39:33.037 --> 39:34.580
for myself and Mrs. Barnett.

39:34.997 --> 39:37.291
We were bystanders at this event,

39:37.958 --> 39:40.503
but others have tried
to cast us as participants...

39:41.462 --> 39:42.797
Are you listening, Jerome?

39:43.589 --> 39:45.299
That's what you're turning loose.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.218
...are important to me.

39:47.676 --> 39:51.180
And I resent what's been done this day
to tarnish them.

39:53.182 --> 39:54.725
Application, Mr. D.A.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.647
For dismissal without prejudice
to renew, Your Honor.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.317
So done. Next?

40:03.984 --> 40:07.238
BAILIFF: Docket number JN-1143,
Sally Bunsel.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.989
Solicitation and attempted robbery.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.785
Sir, I told you all smoking materials
must be extinguished.

40:16.664 --> 40:17.498
Captain?

40:18.874 --> 40:20.459
Can't we get Barnett on the bribe?

40:20.751 --> 40:21.877
We know he bought Simmons off.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.963
They'll just contend
it's an out-of-court settlement.

40:24.046 --> 40:25.840
-But it isn't, Captain!
-There's no civil liabil--

40:26.632 --> 40:28.008
It'll still hold up legally.

40:29.176 --> 40:30.678
-Damn it.
-Excuse me.

40:31.554 --> 40:32.388
Patsy?

40:33.681 --> 40:36.142
Hey, Pats. Pats. You got a minute?

40:36.225 --> 40:38.310
Don't worry about it, LaRue.
I'm not gonna bring charges.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.687
Thanks. I just want you to know

40:39.770 --> 40:41.856
that I didn't let it go any more
in Rose's office

40:41.939 --> 40:43.441
than I thought we needed for the case.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.860
And so far as me showing
the tape to the guys,

40:45.943 --> 40:48.279
hey, I'm a jerk,
but I'm a jerk with everyone.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.448
When does this get interesting, J.D.?

40:52.074 --> 40:53.784
I'm just trying to say I'm sorry.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.080
Look, J.D., the job's tough enough.

40:58.622 --> 40:59.540
But it's three times harder

40:59.623 --> 41:02.209
when I have to deal with this kind
of crap from my own side.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.086
I got you.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.966
So, uh, we okay?

41:10.468 --> 41:11.302
We'll live.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.183
-Miss Davenport, phone.
-Thanks, Leo.

41:17.892 --> 41:18.726
Hello?

41:19.852 --> 41:21.896
-Hello?
-Surprise!

41:23.063 --> 41:25.900
-Surprise!
-(cheering)

41:28.611 --> 41:30.821
<i>♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪</i>

41:30.905 --> 41:33.240
<i>♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪</i>

41:33.324 --> 41:36.994
<i>♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪</i>

41:37.077 --> 41:39.830
<i>♪ Which nobody can deny ♪</i>

41:39.914 --> 41:41.916
-WOMAN: Hip, hip hooray!
-ALL: Hooray!

41:42.416 --> 41:45.711
We're only gonna have half the
cake today, Miss Davenport.

41:45.794 --> 41:49.298
The other half is for when
you put your first bad guy behind bars.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.593
Congratulations, Miss Davenport.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.136
-Bravo.
-Thank you.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.429
Thank you all very much.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.765
Detective Mayo, you have a call on six.

41:59.475 --> 42:00.476
Who wants cake?

42:00.851 --> 42:01.727
Detective Mayo.

42:03.771 --> 42:04.730
It's the chief.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.066
Hello, Chief.

42:08.776 --> 42:09.818
Oh, thank you.

42:10.402 --> 42:11.612
Thank you very much, sir.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.787
Well, um, I'm not sure.

42:19.870 --> 42:22.414
Um, can I get back to you?

42:23.791 --> 42:25.125
Yes. As soon as possible.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.255
What?

42:29.797 --> 42:32.007
Daniels just asked me out
for dinner next week.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.553
(chuckles)

42:36.804 --> 42:37.805
(zipper unzips)

42:42.226 --> 42:43.602
-Hi, Mick.
-Sarge.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.982
-Do any good with that arson undercover?
-Nuh-uh.

42:48.524 --> 42:50.568
The Perez thing might have scared him off.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.237
Maybe we ought
to shut it down for a while.

42:57.658 --> 43:00.452
I think it was good what you said
in roll call this morning, Sarge.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.413
I think that was a good thing to say.

43:03.372 --> 43:05.249
-As regards to being available?
-Yes.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.126
Well, I thought I'd say it.

43:07.501 --> 43:09.628
You let people know
that you're available to talk.

43:10.212 --> 43:11.922
I'm certain there's people who want it.

43:18.554 --> 43:19.597
So, how are things?

43:21.056 --> 43:22.057
You mean with me?

43:23.767 --> 43:24.643
They're all right.

43:24.727 --> 43:25.894
Nothing I can't handle.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.772
How's that little snip of a girl,

43:28.856 --> 43:32.192
that, uh, that cute little girl
from the Heights?

43:32.276 --> 43:33.944
-You mean Robin Tataglia?
-Yeah.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.821
It's over with us. That's finished.

43:37.114 --> 43:40.534
I didn't know her at all.
I just see her come up here occasionally.

43:40.826 --> 43:42.578
In addition I'm being evicted.

43:43.412 --> 43:46.248
-Is that true?
-Yeah, I'm being evicted shortly.

43:51.670 --> 43:55.049
What does it mean?
It means you look for another place.

43:55.132 --> 43:56.425
You find another place.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.636
You find another place.
You find another girlfriend.

43:58.719 --> 44:00.220
You handle the situation.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.229
-You bowl, Mick?
-Not a lot.

44:10.522 --> 44:11.440
What about pinochle?

44:14.610 --> 44:16.028
Not for a long time.

44:17.613 --> 44:19.907
We're having team pinochle
tonight over at St. Bart's.

44:19.990 --> 44:22.034
Mrs. Pyczchewski crapped out on me.

44:23.869 --> 44:25.329
Got to look through the want ads.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.582
Another time.

44:28.999 --> 44:30.167
Maybe some other time.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.544
Thanks for the offer.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.090
Thanks for the talk.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.487
-Hello, Fabian.
-Hi, Mama.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.699
Ah... this is all his stuff.

45:02.116 --> 45:05.035
And he has to be at school
at 8:30 in the morning,

45:05.119 --> 45:07.287
and he's still got some
homework he's got to do.

45:07.371 --> 45:08.539
I'll see he does it.

45:09.039 --> 45:12.376
Oh, and this is Mrs. Morganstern's number.

45:12.459 --> 45:15.087
She's with the Youth Authority.
She can be a help.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.715
If you need anything at all,
just call her.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.341
Or me.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.094
-I got to get going.
-Uh, Miss Bates...

45:23.178 --> 45:25.264
I ain't done so well
by my children to date.

45:25.764 --> 45:28.183
I understand I got to prove myself.

45:28.475 --> 45:29.977
I want you to know I will.

45:31.186 --> 45:32.020
Okay.

45:32.813 --> 45:33.647
Hey.

45:34.106 --> 45:35.315
You gonna call me once in a while?

45:36.400 --> 45:37.234
Okay.

45:40.487 --> 45:42.990
A man who doesn't look out
for his family is nothing.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.826
No excuses, no long stories.

45:45.909 --> 45:47.161
Either you do or you don't.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.997
You did the best you could, man.
You did more.

45:50.873 --> 45:53.333
Bobby, why don't you just come over
and have dinner with me and Daryl Ann?

45:53.876 --> 45:55.127
I think I'll stay here for a while.

45:58.338 --> 46:00.007
Come on, man. Let's go have some family.

46:00.090 --> 46:01.508
Listen to the family here.

46:03.677 --> 46:06.263
-Same?
-No, I don't think so.

46:07.514 --> 46:09.183
At least if I had fought,

46:09.266 --> 46:11.268
I would have known
if I could have kept him or not.

46:11.935 --> 46:13.979
That's a lot of baloney.
That would have just hurt him.

46:14.354 --> 46:15.564
I really blew it.

46:16.648 --> 46:17.691
Hey, no way, Luce.

46:18.484 --> 46:19.860
You were great.
You were great for that kid.

46:22.279 --> 46:24.823
He was so sweet. He was such a sweet kid.

46:30.037 --> 46:31.997
Look, I know it's gonna be
hard being without him.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.416
So if it makes it any easier,

46:35.459 --> 46:37.544
you ought to know that you
probably saved a life.

46:38.796 --> 46:39.922
Maybe two lives.

46:43.675 --> 46:45.344
So you feel terrific now, huh?

46:46.345 --> 46:47.179
Come on.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.974
-Mm.
-Mm. I feel terrific.

48:02.170 --> 48:04.548
