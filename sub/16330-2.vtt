00:03.764 --> 00:05.584
I had another memory.

00:07.296 --> 00:09.758
It was my most vivid one yet.

00:09.793 --> 00:12.464
What was it?

00:12.559 --> 00:14.672
It was hot.

00:14.730 --> 00:17.682
I was high above the treetops.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074

00:33.157 --> 00:35.441
- _
- We were taking out a hostile target.

00:42.816 --> 00:44.600
_

00:45.468 --> 00:46.833
_

00:47.643 --> 00:48.665
_

00:51.910 --> 00:53.020
_

01:03.704 --> 01:06.742
Pull back to the chopper.

01:06.777 --> 01:08.830
Pull back to the chopper now!

01:23.196 --> 01:24.978
How'd you remember that?

01:25.867 --> 01:28.023
Because they wanted me to.

01:28.057 --> 01:31.225
Shepherd and Roman took me to a memorial.

01:31.260 --> 01:32.643
It was small.

01:32.678 --> 01:34.257
Out of the way.

01:34.259 --> 01:35.541
Why?

01:35.579 --> 01:37.523
To reindoctrinate her.

01:37.575 --> 01:41.142
The CIA formed ORION to
carry out off-the-book ops.

01:41.177 --> 01:42.744
But I though that's what SEALs were for.

01:42.768 --> 01:46.269
Orion was for illegal,
unsanctioned operations.

01:46.271 --> 01:49.023
Assassinations. Regime change.

01:49.070 --> 01:51.519
Missions too grisly to go
through legitimate channels.

01:51.566 --> 01:54.198
When Douglas Winter blew the
whistle on the illegal NSA program

01:54.255 --> 01:55.632
that was feeding them intel,

01:55.667 --> 01:57.876
the CIA shut ORION down.

01:57.911 --> 02:00.587
Tried to erase any trace.

02:00.622 --> 02:02.352
You were the only one that survived.

02:02.419 --> 02:04.698
They thought they killed you, too.

02:04.754 --> 02:06.522
We chose not to correct them.

02:06.588 --> 02:10.079
This plaque is the closest
thing ORION has to a memorial.

02:10.157 --> 02:12.398
This is what your country
thought you were worth.

02:12.470 --> 02:15.686
America needs to be saved from itself.

02:15.733 --> 02:19.246
- How? An attack?
- More than that.

02:19.299 --> 02:21.545
It'll be a complete
reset. We're gonna comp...

02:21.580 --> 02:23.311
That's enough.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.411
It's better if you don't know.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.334
They might interrogate you.

02:30.473 --> 02:32.154
We need to get her back.

02:32.184 --> 02:34.422
There's something we need you to do today.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.208
Something important.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.485
Shepherd gave me something else.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.261
What?

02:41.296 --> 02:43.320
A tattoo case.

02:43.387 --> 02:46.045
The coliseum pillars on my lower abdomen.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.816
Said it needed to be solved today.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.888
I don't like them dictating our timeline.

02:49.923 --> 02:51.364
I'll get my analysts on it.

02:51.399 --> 02:54.986
No, you're the one that said we
need to keep chasing these tattoos.

02:55.055 --> 02:57.853
Otherwise, Sandstorm
will know something's off.

02:57.888 --> 02:59.411
We're following this.

02:59.482 --> 03:01.423
She's not wrong.

03:01.458 --> 03:02.946
The last time they brought us a case,

03:02.948 --> 03:04.757
we brought down a sex trafficking ring

03:04.807 --> 03:07.310
and stopped an innocent
man from being executed.

03:07.345 --> 03:10.555
And how does Sandstorm expect us to
buy that you cracked this on your own?

03:10.590 --> 03:12.444
They gave me a hint.

03:12.527 --> 03:15.759
They said to say that I was changing
the dressing on my gunshot wound...

03:17.387 --> 03:21.215
...and I saw that the spaces in
between the pillars looked like bullets.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.099
I'll get Patterson on it.

03:23.177 --> 03:24.422
Good work, Jane.

03:36.398 --> 03:38.538
Freddy.

03:38.602 --> 03:39.538
It's Edgar.

03:39.573 --> 03:41.843
Edgar Reade, Mulmur Hills Football Camp.

03:43.108 --> 03:44.490
Eddie Reade.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.622
Look at you!

03:45.697 --> 03:48.491
- What's it been, 15 years?
- Oh, man, yeah.

03:48.493 --> 03:49.993
Look at that suit.

03:50.062 --> 03:51.670
What are you, an accountant or something?

03:51.694 --> 03:53.419
FBI, actually.

03:53.454 --> 03:55.421
FBI? This is a friendly visit right?

03:55.456 --> 03:57.538
Yeah, it's friendly, it's friendly.

03:57.643 --> 03:59.319
Yo, I'm on break!

04:03.481 --> 04:06.509
So what do I owe the pleasure, Mr. FBI man?

04:06.511 --> 04:07.896
Been in touch with a few of our campmates,

04:07.920 --> 04:09.418
a couple of them pointed
me in your direction.

04:09.442 --> 04:11.061
I wanted to give you a
call before I came here,

04:11.085 --> 04:13.679
but I... couldn't get a number on you.

04:13.774 --> 04:15.518
Yeah, I'm...

04:15.520 --> 04:16.812
kind of between providers.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.067
Uh... hey, you heard about

04:22.110 --> 04:24.005
Tim Scott and Levi Hart, right?

04:24.064 --> 04:26.868
This ain't about football.
Jones ruined my life.

04:29.192 --> 04:30.289
Yeah, I heard.

04:30.355 --> 04:34.307
Yeah, Tim and Levi, they went to
that camp a long time after we did.

04:34.342 --> 04:37.327
I've been working with an
assistant DA trying to build a case.

04:37.362 --> 04:41.545
It looks like Jones abused a
lot of kids for a lot of years.

04:41.604 --> 04:45.669
Now, we're having trouble getting
victims to come in and testify.

04:47.736 --> 04:51.609
Maybe they trying to move on
with their lives, you know?

04:51.701 --> 04:53.532
Keep the past in the past.

04:53.589 --> 04:56.213
Why bring all that muck
back up to the surface?

04:56.286 --> 04:59.036
Because if you don't, Jones is gonna walk.

04:59.172 --> 05:01.075
We can't change what he did.

05:01.139 --> 05:03.732
Jones is still out there.
What if he's not finished?

05:05.047 --> 05:07.915
That man was supposed to
protect us... look out for us.

05:07.972 --> 05:11.066
Don't you think it's about time
he's paid for what he's done?

05:17.107 --> 05:19.941
Here. Please, just give the ADA a call.

05:24.919 --> 05:26.280
Thank you.

05:29.650 --> 05:31.786
It's really good to see you again, man.

05:32.021 --> 05:33.666
Man, you too, man.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.343
Hey, Freddy!

05:39.629 --> 05:40.878
We'll get him.

05:41.994 --> 05:43.396
I promise.

05:52.025 --> 05:54.194
There's a box in my place.

05:54.922 --> 05:58.006
It's pictures. Clothes.

05:58.041 --> 06:00.132
It's the last belongings of my father.

06:00.167 --> 06:01.720
She's under the fort, Kurt.

06:01.764 --> 06:03.014
Who's under the fort, Dad?

06:03.049 --> 06:05.996
I killed Taylor Shaw.

06:06.227 --> 06:10.564
I can't throw it out. Why?

06:10.635 --> 06:12.937
That box is the last piece you have of him.

06:13.018 --> 06:14.435
Once it's gone, so is he.

06:14.498 --> 06:16.498
I want him gone.

06:16.748 --> 06:18.238
I hate him.

06:18.346 --> 06:20.146
He was still your father, Kurt.

06:20.227 --> 06:21.853
And you're still using the present tense.

06:21.877 --> 06:24.004
My hate is not going anywhere.

06:24.055 --> 06:26.018
That's because you're not dealing with it.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.854
Can you articulate where
these feelings come from?

06:30.180 --> 06:32.013
If you can't name it, externalize it,

06:32.067 --> 06:34.282
then you can't move past it, Kurt.

06:35.591 --> 06:37.975
- _
- We're gonna have to call this one short.

06:39.523 --> 06:41.556
Your father's dead, Kurt.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.875
It's too late to confront him now,

06:43.923 --> 06:46.661
but until you confront
your feelings about him,

06:46.789 --> 06:49.290
his shadow will follow you wherever you go.

06:54.629 --> 06:56.923
We knew the columns on
Jane's tattoo are consistent

06:56.958 --> 06:59.464
with a particular architectural style,

06:59.499 --> 07:01.762
but the hidden bullets,
that was news to me.

07:01.817 --> 07:02.536
From Jane's perspective,

07:02.571 --> 07:04.959
they look almost exactly
like .40 caliber rounds.

07:05.048 --> 07:08.167
I cross-referenced the bullets with
the building style, and guess what.

07:08.202 --> 07:10.614
The same rounds were used
to shoot up the wedding

07:10.649 --> 07:13.241
of a Mexico City narcotics
officer last year.

07:13.276 --> 07:14.902
Police suspected the Juarez Cartel,

07:14.967 --> 07:18.067
but the investigation dried up because
detectives kept getting murdered.

07:18.069 --> 07:20.992
That level of violence
definitely matches the Juarez M.O.

07:21.073 --> 07:23.790
I tracked down the serial numbers
for the guns recovered at the scene.

07:23.792 --> 07:25.361
Three months before the massacre,

07:25.410 --> 07:28.019
they were recovered in a
raid by the New York DEA.

07:28.054 --> 07:31.658
How does a Mexican cartel steal
weapons from the New York DEA?

07:31.693 --> 07:34.241
- They don't. The DEA sold them.
- What?

07:34.276 --> 07:35.964
That was through the gun-waltzing program?

07:36.036 --> 07:37.149
Why couldn't I find that?

07:37.184 --> 07:39.030
'Cause you don't work for the NSA.

07:39.065 --> 07:41.328
I thought the attorney
general shut that program down.

07:41.363 --> 07:43.583
- Apparently not.
- What is gun-waltzing?

07:43.630 --> 07:44.756
It's a bad idea.

07:44.791 --> 07:46.324
It puts these weapons back on the streets

07:46.348 --> 07:48.429
through agents posing as arms dealers.

07:48.464 --> 07:51.205
Then trace the weapons back to
the big players for big busts.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.119
Only sometimes, they lose them.

07:54.190 --> 07:55.227
Hang on a second.

07:55.293 --> 07:57.728
This says that the D.A.'s
set to release more weapons

07:57.763 --> 07:59.632
through its program today,

07:59.687 --> 08:01.376
including four stinger missiles.

08:01.411 --> 08:02.467
Are you serious?

08:02.502 --> 08:05.582
Don't weapons that size seem
a little risky to use as bait?

08:05.617 --> 08:07.359
Stingers can hit targets
up to four miles away.

08:07.383 --> 08:08.736
They're reliable and accurate.

08:08.771 --> 08:09.771
Wait a second.

08:09.804 --> 08:11.304
Nine Juarez Cartel associates

08:11.306 --> 08:13.744
popped up on facial
recognition at JFK yesterday.

08:13.779 --> 08:16.129
Does that seem like a pretty
big coincidence to anyone else?

08:16.153 --> 08:17.747
That's not good... the Juarez Cartel

08:17.813 --> 08:19.847
has been increasing its
attacks inside the U.S.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.581
Shepherd did say it was urgent,

08:21.616 --> 08:23.539
that thousands of lives
hang in the balance.

08:23.605 --> 08:26.382
The cartel are gonna buy
those missiles from the DEA.

08:26.417 --> 08:29.594
They want to hit a target here, today.

08:34.884 --> 08:39.884
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

08:44.250 --> 08:46.078
This doesn't seem off to you?

08:46.164 --> 08:48.411
Chasing down a Sandstorm lead like this?

08:48.446 --> 08:51.162
The Juarez Cartel could be planning
an attack in the U.S. today.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.746
We don't have much choice.

08:52.781 --> 08:56.172
Besides, every tattoo on Jane's
body has come from Sandstorm.

08:56.207 --> 08:58.287
The only difference now is we
know who's behind the curtain.

08:58.311 --> 09:00.542
What if it's a setup?

09:00.577 --> 09:03.481
What if Jane's tattoo is
leading us into a trap?

09:03.483 --> 09:04.971
Jane was the trap. All right?

09:05.006 --> 09:07.669
We already fell into it. She played us.

09:07.704 --> 09:10.662
Look, I don't like working
with her any more than you do.

09:10.697 --> 09:12.410
I don't like being in the same room as her.

09:12.434 --> 09:14.668
But... it's the only way to end this.

09:18.948 --> 09:21.174
Patterson's got something.

09:28.086 --> 09:29.285
What do you mean you're
not bringing a case?

09:29.309 --> 09:31.510
We can't win... not
without stronger evidence

09:31.545 --> 09:33.289
than the testimony of a school shooter

09:33.324 --> 09:35.077
- and a junkie drunk.
- _

09:35.112 --> 09:36.571
I really don't have
time for this right now.

09:36.595 --> 09:38.983
Look, Freddy has his struggles.

09:39.018 --> 09:40.184
He's a victim.

09:40.269 --> 09:41.284
He helps the case.

09:41.319 --> 09:43.099
Substance abuse, theft.

09:43.134 --> 09:44.729
Jones's lawyers would tear him apart.

09:44.799 --> 09:46.302
Do you have any idea how many children

09:46.326 --> 09:48.444
Jones could have hurt
over the past two decades?

09:48.479 --> 09:50.424
No! Because none of them
will go on the record.

09:50.459 --> 09:53.098
Freddy will! He's sober.
He's gainfully employed.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.921
Freddy's sober now. He's employed now.

09:55.972 --> 09:58.038
He was neither of those
things two months ago.

09:58.112 --> 09:59.562
What happens in another two
months when he falls apart

09:59.586 --> 10:01.050
again and I need him on the stand?

10:01.085 --> 10:03.285
Which is exactly why we need to do this!

10:06.253 --> 10:08.264
Freddy is the very example

10:08.315 --> 10:09.603
of what Jones has done to these guys.

10:09.627 --> 10:11.093
Don't you understand that?

10:12.135 --> 10:13.840
I know it's not justice,

10:13.904 --> 10:17.072
but neither is taking this
guy to court and losing.

10:19.135 --> 10:20.657
Gail, please don't do
this to me. I promise...

10:20.681 --> 10:22.481
It's just not gonna happen.

10:23.242 --> 10:25.325
Tell your friend I'm sorry.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.495
I tracked down the requisitions
from the DEA's gun-waltzing program.

10:38.530 --> 10:41.129
Almost all the guns that
walked and never came back

10:41.164 --> 10:42.903
were signed out by the same person...

10:42.978 --> 10:45.980
a field agent named Valentine Barker.

10:46.015 --> 10:48.171
And get this. In nearly every instance,

10:48.206 --> 10:50.420
they were sold to people with
ties to the Juarez Cartel.

10:50.455 --> 10:51.596
That kind of firepower,

10:51.631 --> 10:53.892
it's no wonder they've been
escalating their violence.

10:53.930 --> 10:55.880
So the losses aren't accidents.

10:55.927 --> 10:58.818
She's using the program to cover
the sale of weapons to the cartel.

10:58.873 --> 11:00.135
Where's Valentine now?

11:00.170 --> 11:02.668
DEA doesn't know where
Valentine or the weapons are.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.712
She's at a bank in Queens
trying to cash out her account.

11:05.747 --> 11:06.854
For real?

11:06.889 --> 11:08.272
Why don't I have access to that?

11:08.274 --> 11:09.354
She's getting ready to run.

11:09.423 --> 11:10.589
Let's move.

11:14.803 --> 11:17.262
I'll need access to my safe deposit box.

11:21.785 --> 11:24.546
So, are we just not gonna
talk about how messed up it is

11:24.592 --> 11:27.074
Jane's out here with us?

11:27.172 --> 11:28.639
Sandstorm are watching.

11:28.707 --> 11:30.880
It has to look like business as usual.

11:31.002 --> 11:32.526
Otherwise, it could blow her cover.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.471
It was one thing when we
thought she was a pawn,

11:34.496 --> 11:38.078
but her mother's the leader, and
her brother's a homicidal maniac.

11:38.206 --> 11:40.083
Sandstorm is in Jane's blood.

11:40.118 --> 11:40.948
Just keep her in front of me.

11:40.983 --> 11:43.975
I don't want to wind up on the
wrong end of a friendly fire report.

11:52.350 --> 11:55.225
Look, everything they
knew about you is a lie.

11:55.260 --> 11:57.316
You've got to give them
time to forgive you.

11:57.351 --> 11:59.045
They handed me over to the CIA

11:59.119 --> 12:03.601
to be tortured and interrogated
without charge or trial.

12:03.751 --> 12:06.525
As far as I can tell,
this country runs on lies.

12:06.575 --> 12:07.773
Look, I understand that you're angry...

12:07.797 --> 12:10.423
No, you have no idea what it feels like

12:10.458 --> 12:13.031
to be looked at with hatred
and suspicion at every...

12:13.066 --> 12:16.028
I'm a Pakistani-born
woman who's busted my ass

12:16.065 --> 12:18.834
climbing to the top of the
National Security Agency.

12:18.896 --> 12:22.730
You think I haven't dealt with my
share of aggression and mistrust?

12:26.225 --> 12:29.490
I've seen the laws this
country's willing to violate,

12:29.525 --> 12:33.963
and all I've seen Sandstorm do is
expose corruption and save lives.

12:34.032 --> 12:36.474
How can you be so sure we're
on the right side of this?

12:36.550 --> 12:39.525
Shepherd's group has
destroyed thousands of lives.

12:39.572 --> 12:41.158
These people are killers, and...

12:41.262 --> 12:42.929
they need to be stopped.

12:56.883 --> 12:58.799
All right, team, let's
do this by the numbers.

12:58.864 --> 13:00.134
Hold on a second.

13:00.136 --> 13:02.633
Two guys in suits right in front of us.

13:02.708 --> 13:05.220
That's an interesting tattoo for a banker.

13:05.255 --> 13:07.523
You got two more on your left side.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.349
Valentine's got cartel protection?

13:12.104 --> 13:13.758
No, not protection.

13:15.288 --> 13:17.289
Valentine! Down!

13:19.513 --> 13:21.013
FBI!

13:27.798 --> 13:28.964
Aah!

13:39.417 --> 13:41.117
You got Jane?

13:42.667 --> 13:44.471
She's on my three, got her!

13:54.116 --> 13:56.574
- On the ground, now!
- Drop your weapon!

13:58.264 --> 14:00.765
These are Juarez Cartel tattoos.

14:01.178 --> 14:03.575
She's supplying weapons to the cartel.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.611
Why are they trying to kill you, then? Hmm?

14:15.185 --> 14:17.436
You seem agitated.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.066
What's on your mind?

14:24.529 --> 14:26.445
Nothing I can think of.

14:26.509 --> 14:28.174
Well, if you won't tell
me, maybe you can confide

14:28.198 --> 14:30.495
in one of your teammates...
Weller, perhaps.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.171
I don't like working with
her any more than you do.

14:32.195 --> 14:34.195
I don't like being in the same room as her.

14:35.051 --> 14:35.924
Yeah...

14:35.959 --> 14:38.821
I don't see that happening right now.

14:39.249 --> 14:41.365
Well, he's going through a lot.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.991
You mean his dad?

14:43.026 --> 14:46.288
Yes... it seems both of you are
feeling rather alone at the moment,

14:46.337 --> 14:50.093
and sometimes the best we can do
is to try to feel alone together.

14:50.158 --> 14:52.176
You and Kurt could help each other.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.264
Yeah, maybe.

14:55.299 --> 14:57.082
After all, Jane...

14:57.359 --> 15:00.277
this team's the closest
thing to family you've got.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.897
I don't know what you
want from me, all right?

15:04.968 --> 15:07.009
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- So why were you getting shot at

15:07.033 --> 15:08.880
by cartel members, Valentine?

15:08.915 --> 15:10.935
All I know is I started
getting followed yesterday

15:10.970 --> 15:13.843
and decided to get some distance
so I could figure out why.

15:13.878 --> 15:15.700
I've put away a lot of dangerous people.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.422
We know you've been using
the gun-waltzing program.

15:17.446 --> 15:18.941
Defense weapons to the Juarez Cartel,

15:18.976 --> 15:21.508
and they've been using
those weapons in the U.S.

15:21.555 --> 15:23.647
Just tell us where the stingers
are and where the sale's happening.

15:23.671 --> 15:24.857
Stingers?

15:24.938 --> 15:26.238
I don't even run the...

15:26.304 --> 15:28.804
My boss, Robert Kingston,
runs that program.

15:28.854 --> 15:29.987
Does he?

15:30.059 --> 15:31.981
So explain this.

15:32.039 --> 15:35.923
Why is your signature on every
one of these requisitions,

15:35.966 --> 15:37.430
including this morning's?

15:37.483 --> 15:39.473
I-I wasn't even in this morning!

15:39.508 --> 15:40.941
These should all be Rob's.

15:40.976 --> 15:42.604
This doesn't make any sense!

15:42.639 --> 15:44.484
Actually, it makes plenty of sense.

15:44.519 --> 15:46.312
It's okay, me and Reade have got this.

15:46.347 --> 15:48.820
I just cracked one of the gunmen's phones.

15:48.884 --> 15:51.200
Kingston ordered the hit on you.

15:51.754 --> 15:54.966
_

15:55.001 --> 15:57.117
No...

15:57.190 --> 15:59.047
This... this can't...
this can't be possible!

15:59.092 --> 16:00.265
Rob's my mentor.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.617
He taught me how to be DEA, for God's sake!

16:04.558 --> 16:05.802
But?

16:05.860 --> 16:07.512
What is it, Valentine?

16:09.136 --> 16:10.818
About six months ago,

16:10.853 --> 16:13.116
I was going over numbers for the program...

16:13.151 --> 16:15.963
and the loss incidence for
weapons was being underreported.

16:16.029 --> 16:17.640
And who did you bring this to?

16:17.725 --> 16:19.948
A friend at the DOJ.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.260
And Rob.

16:21.302 --> 16:22.809
He thanked me for the catch

16:22.883 --> 16:24.556
and promised he'd deal with it.

16:24.591 --> 16:26.163
And did he?

16:26.198 --> 16:27.332
Two days ago,

16:27.367 --> 16:31.621
I checked the loss incidence
again, and it had gone up.

16:31.656 --> 16:34.691
I told Rob we had to take it upstairs.

16:34.748 --> 16:37.818
He said he would shut down the program...

16:37.892 --> 16:38.960
after they handled it.

16:39.024 --> 16:40.907
And he tried to handle you instead.

16:42.144 --> 16:43.727
He was like a father to me.

16:46.018 --> 16:47.601
How could he do this?

16:49.140 --> 16:50.440
Spit it out, Roman.

16:50.498 --> 16:52.481
I shadow her, make sure she's all right.

16:52.527 --> 16:53.820
No.

16:54.473 --> 16:55.619
Cade's still out there.

16:55.654 --> 16:56.728
She just spent three months in a hole.

16:56.752 --> 16:57.424
She's too fragile to just...

16:57.459 --> 17:00.681
If there's one thing your
sister is not, it's fragile.

17:01.306 --> 17:04.006
I will be invisible, I promise.

17:04.478 --> 17:05.859
She protected me my whole life.

17:05.926 --> 17:08.394
- If I can help...
- Is this about you or her?

17:08.750 --> 17:11.166
I won't have you risking this mission.

17:16.104 --> 17:17.936
Stay away from her, Roman.

17:19.133 --> 17:21.183
Let your sister do her job.

17:25.484 --> 17:28.035
Kingston hasn't checked in
with the DEA since yesterday,

17:28.069 --> 17:30.321
and so far, no one can
physically locate him.

17:30.356 --> 17:31.696
He goes dark a lot for his cover.

17:31.731 --> 17:32.990
He poses as an arms dealer.

17:33.025 --> 17:35.709
We've got to stop your boss
before he sells those missiles.

17:35.744 --> 17:37.113
All right, we believe

17:37.159 --> 17:38.866
the cartel will use them today.

17:38.901 --> 17:41.275
With weapons that powerful,
they can kill thousands.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.412
Rob transitions the weapons off-book
through a storage locker in Brooklyn.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.648
We might be able to
catch him, but I want in.

17:46.683 --> 17:48.106
No, absolutely not.

17:48.141 --> 17:49.838
Look, he tried to have me killed, okay?

17:49.905 --> 17:51.589
I want to put the cuffs on him myself.

17:51.643 --> 17:53.667
No... you're too close to this.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.045
She's not a kid.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.014
She's a trained DEA agent.

17:57.068 --> 17:58.326
She knows Kingston.

17:58.399 --> 18:00.399
She'll be an asset out there.

18:01.651 --> 18:02.619
Fine.

18:02.654 --> 18:03.884
Okay.

18:03.919 --> 18:05.210
Go get Jane. We're moving out.

18:05.262 --> 18:07.564
- We?
- We. Go get her.

18:13.414 --> 18:15.116
Oh, there you are.

18:15.683 --> 18:16.613
Uh, do you have a moment?

18:16.648 --> 18:18.716
Uh... no. Actually, we're...

18:18.751 --> 18:21.089
It's just... I got you this.

18:21.124 --> 18:22.874
It's "Oregon Trail."

18:22.940 --> 18:25.749
I stumbled across it on
eBay and I... thought of you.

18:25.784 --> 18:27.523
Oh, you just stumbled across this?

18:27.558 --> 18:28.400
Well...

18:28.435 --> 18:30.288
That's very, um...

18:30.323 --> 18:33.217
Where do you imagine that I could use this?

18:33.269 --> 18:35.209
Um, does one of your computers

18:35.244 --> 18:37.828
not have an old disc drive or something?

18:37.891 --> 18:39.307
No, I...

18:39.406 --> 18:40.892
They're all pretty new.

18:41.056 --> 18:44.202
Oh. And no...

18:44.296 --> 18:45.959
backwards compatible...

18:46.044 --> 18:48.412
No. Uh, you don't know
a lot about computers.

18:48.447 --> 18:50.447
W-Would you like to have dinner with me?

18:52.586 --> 18:53.885
Oh, I...

18:53.920 --> 18:55.425
Sorry, that wasn't a great... um...

18:55.486 --> 18:56.914
Not now, obviously.

18:56.949 --> 18:58.809
You're obviously, um, you know,

18:58.909 --> 18:59.559
busy, now.

18:59.594 --> 19:01.260
But, you know, at some point,

19:01.295 --> 19:03.147
a proper dinner, in the future,

19:03.182 --> 19:07.139
as in, we'd make plans to
go to dinner in the future.

19:07.195 --> 19:08.927
Um, am I making any sense?

19:08.962 --> 19:11.255
Yeah, yes. Yes.

19:11.257 --> 19:13.891
But, uh, yes, I'm making sense or...

19:13.964 --> 19:17.183
Uh, yes to dinner.

19:17.269 --> 19:19.202
Good, great. Uh, okay.

19:19.237 --> 19:20.632
Well, I'll e-mail you.

19:20.667 --> 19:21.674
Are you sure you can handle that?

19:21.698 --> 19:23.113
'Cause that involves a computer.

19:23.148 --> 19:24.349
Or I'll just use

19:24.384 --> 19:25.884
a carrier pigeon or something.

19:25.939 --> 19:27.763
Okay. Yeah.

19:29.165 --> 19:30.531
Thank you.

19:31.889 --> 19:33.139
Uh...

19:37.247 --> 19:39.247
This is gonna be a maze.

19:40.587 --> 19:43.103
All right... let's split up
and see if we can find Kingston.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.892
Valentine, hang back at the exit,

19:44.958 --> 19:47.013
see if he's heading in or out.

19:47.048 --> 19:48.427
Why doesn't Jane hang back?

19:48.462 --> 19:50.378
Because she's inside with us.

19:50.535 --> 19:52.118
Jane, with me.

19:53.216 --> 19:54.765
Move.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.636
Section one, clear.

19:58.638 --> 20:00.137
Two, clear.

20:00.139 --> 20:01.973
Three, clear.

20:04.476 --> 20:06.892
I've got him... he's headed
out in one of the rental vans.

20:06.927 --> 20:07.711
He must already have the weapons!

20:07.746 --> 20:09.404
Valentine, do not engage!

20:09.439 --> 20:10.513
Team, fall back!

20:10.548 --> 20:12.464
You're not gonna make it. I've got him.

20:12.625 --> 20:15.523
Gun on the dashboard and get out, now!

20:17.038 --> 20:19.015
Valentine, wait for us!

20:20.978 --> 20:22.698
You want to point that somewhere else, Val?

20:22.750 --> 20:24.589
I trusted you.

20:24.709 --> 20:27.729
- Believed you.
- Just let me explain.

20:27.764 --> 20:29.967
You're under arrest, Rob.

20:34.998 --> 20:36.548
Valentine's down!

20:39.852 --> 20:40.812
Get an ambulance!

20:40.857 --> 20:42.097
Anyone got eyes on Kingston?

20:42.132 --> 20:43.112
Negative, negative.

20:43.147 --> 20:44.740
Negative, he's in the wind.

20:44.821 --> 20:46.573
So are the missiles.

21:04.337 --> 21:06.417
Sir, we have orders not to let you leave.

21:06.452 --> 21:07.996
Oh, yeah?

21:08.107 --> 21:09.940
And how were you planning to do that?

21:11.953 --> 21:14.006
Maybe we should all talk
this over with Shepherd.

21:14.097 --> 21:15.097
Move.

21:15.152 --> 21:16.818
I'm afraid we can't do that.

21:19.006 --> 21:20.006
Uhh!

21:25.282 --> 21:26.485
Roman! Stop it!

21:26.520 --> 21:27.852
Roman!

21:35.274 --> 21:36.130
I won't lose her again.

21:36.203 --> 21:39.092
Your sister can take care of herself.

21:39.991 --> 21:41.849
Go clean yourself up.

21:49.499 --> 21:50.848
That is not what I'm saying.

21:50.903 --> 21:54.427
I don't have time to argue
with you right now, okay?

21:54.462 --> 21:55.300
How's Valentine?

21:55.335 --> 21:57.711
Doctors are doing what they can, but...

21:57.786 --> 21:58.650
It doesn't look good.

21:58.688 --> 22:00.557
Look, we can't worry about that right now.

22:00.618 --> 22:02.467
Kingston's about to sell the Juarez Cartel

22:02.502 --> 22:04.253
enough firepower to start a war.

22:04.288 --> 22:06.079
We need to find him and fast.

22:06.118 --> 22:07.851
Can't you just use your magic phone?

22:07.903 --> 22:09.229
Excuse me?

22:09.264 --> 22:11.447
Oh, does it stop working
if they ditch their plates?

22:11.482 --> 22:13.924
Patterson... stop it.

22:14.010 --> 22:15.890
Look, if you have something
to say to me, then say it.

22:15.914 --> 22:18.168
I don't want you in the field with us.

22:18.239 --> 22:20.313
She is a distraction and a liability.

22:20.365 --> 22:22.532
I'm the distraction that saved
Reade's life this morning,

22:22.556 --> 22:23.421
'cause if I hadn't been there,

22:23.456 --> 22:25.096
he'd have a bullet in his back right now.

22:25.138 --> 22:26.591
And if you'd never been
here in the first place,

22:26.615 --> 22:28.448
Mayfair would still be alive right now.

22:28.512 --> 22:30.261
All right, enough!

22:30.347 --> 22:32.495
I'm sick of all of this.

22:33.232 --> 22:37.499
Until we stop Sandstorm,
Jane is part of this team.

22:38.299 --> 22:41.606
And, Patterson, stop
treating Naz and the NSA

22:41.608 --> 22:44.359
like a threat and start working with them.

22:44.394 --> 22:46.892
We are all here for the same thing.

22:46.927 --> 22:49.382
It's not about keeping score.

22:49.417 --> 22:52.167
And, Naz, this is a joint task force.

22:52.202 --> 22:53.634
I get it... but if you and I

22:53.669 --> 22:55.813
keep trying to run the
ball in opposite directions,

22:55.853 --> 22:58.556
this mission will implode before it starts.

22:58.591 --> 23:00.862
So let's all take a breath...
and try and figure out a way

23:00.886 --> 23:03.484
that we can work together
to get these missiles back

23:03.519 --> 23:07.486
before the cartel hits whatever
they're trying to hit today.

23:08.934 --> 23:10.567
Patterson is right.

23:10.687 --> 23:13.380
The NSA can access all
the traffic cams at once,

23:13.415 --> 23:15.904
but our software is looking for plates,

23:15.978 --> 23:17.650
so if Kingston has swapped his out,

23:17.685 --> 23:20.019
then he's as good as invisible.

23:20.236 --> 23:22.364
No... No, he isn't.

23:22.427 --> 23:25.900
See, the ads on Kingston's
rental van are distinct.

23:25.902 --> 23:28.586
I can modify some code for the NSA software

23:28.652 --> 23:30.952
that searches based on
shape and color scheme,

23:30.987 --> 23:33.528
but I'll need a second.

23:33.563 --> 23:34.993
I'll loop in my guys.

23:34.995 --> 23:36.544
Get you support from outside.

23:36.546 --> 23:37.897
There you go.

23:37.953 --> 23:40.487
Let's all give Patterson
some space so she can work.

23:51.053 --> 23:53.768
Feel like I just got yelled
at at the principal's office.

23:53.803 --> 23:55.824
He's right, we should be
focused on the mission.

23:55.875 --> 23:58.601
You're one to talk. You've
been distracted all day.

23:59.534 --> 24:01.086
What's up?

24:03.071 --> 24:04.820
Saw an old friend this morning.

24:04.941 --> 24:07.368
We went to football camp together as kids.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.924
Coach Jones ran it.

24:09.714 --> 24:10.356
Oh.

24:10.391 --> 24:12.089
Freddy's one of his victims.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.428
Guy's hanging on by a thread.

24:13.463 --> 24:14.829
I push him to open old wounds,

24:14.867 --> 24:16.198
promise him Jones will pay,

24:16.271 --> 24:18.695
and now the D.A.'s
telling me there's no case.

24:20.230 --> 24:21.028
Sorry.

24:21.063 --> 24:24.650
Jones failed him, the system
failed him, and now I failed him.

24:24.709 --> 24:26.412
What the hell do I tell this guy?

24:26.483 --> 24:28.096
The truth.

24:28.488 --> 24:30.021
What else is there?

24:41.166 --> 24:43.190
Hey, can I...

24:44.256 --> 24:45.586
What are you doing in here?

24:45.621 --> 24:47.831
Just going through case notes.

24:47.866 --> 24:48.933
In the dark?

24:48.968 --> 24:50.575
I'm an auditory learner.

24:50.610 --> 24:51.610
What's up?

24:52.057 --> 24:54.139
I don't think I can do this.

24:54.183 --> 24:56.527
Working inside Sandstorm,
being on this team again...

24:56.563 --> 24:58.447
All due respect, Jane...

24:58.492 --> 25:01.160
what do you consider your alternative?

25:01.474 --> 25:03.357
Is that a threat?

25:04.684 --> 25:05.954
Look...

25:07.221 --> 25:10.639
You don't keep up your
end, our deal goes away.

25:10.730 --> 25:12.304
No protection from Sandstorm.

25:12.352 --> 25:14.407
No protection from the CIA.

25:18.091 --> 25:19.654
Tom Carter.

25:24.947 --> 25:26.271
What about him?

25:26.273 --> 25:27.978
In all our NSA's data-scraping,

25:28.018 --> 25:30.317
we found one reference to ORION.

25:30.352 --> 25:34.229
It was in a deleted e-mail we
recovered from the CIA's servers.

25:34.308 --> 25:35.315
Carter sent it.

25:35.373 --> 25:37.431
Tell me... what's ORION?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.231
Based on his career M.O.

25:40.266 --> 25:43.301
and whereabouts during ORION's existence,

25:43.685 --> 25:45.101
it's very likely that he ran it,

25:45.136 --> 25:47.720
which would explain his interest in you.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.461
And that's why he wanted me dead.

25:50.599 --> 25:51.977
It's a pretty big piece of the puzzle,

25:52.001 --> 25:53.852
wouldn't you say?

25:53.922 --> 25:56.463
Don't you want to stick
around, fill in the rest?

26:00.027 --> 26:02.596
Jane, I know that this isn't easy for you,

26:02.678 --> 26:06.090
but you have everything to
gain by seeing this through.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.201
And everything to lose if I don't.

26:08.786 --> 26:12.066
Well, believe it or not, I am on your side.

26:13.153 --> 26:16.975
You don't have to like me,
but... you can trust me.

26:17.870 --> 26:19.347
I promise.

26:31.863 --> 26:33.010
Nothing I can think of.

26:33.068 --> 26:33.885
Well, if you won't tell me,

26:33.934 --> 26:36.078
maybe you can confide
in one of your teammates.

26:36.113 --> 26:37.113
Weller, perhaps?

26:37.155 --> 26:40.224
Yeah, I don't see that happening right now.

26:40.259 --> 26:42.043
Well, he's going through a lot.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.745
- You mean his dad?
- Yes.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.826
I'm sorry. I didn't meant to hurt them.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.629
Yes, you did.

26:58.875 --> 27:01.144
And I'm sorry I disobeyed you.

27:01.203 --> 27:04.222
You need to keep your elbows
in and your shoulders down.

27:04.257 --> 27:08.177
You're wasting energy, and
you're telegraphing every hit.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.334
She's gonna be fine.

27:12.397 --> 27:13.813
What if she isn't?

27:14.959 --> 27:16.523
It should be me out there.

27:16.601 --> 27:17.924
If I die, what does it matter?

27:17.974 --> 27:19.897
If something happens...

27:20.493 --> 27:23.461
You're so sweet, Roman.

27:25.183 --> 27:27.684
But you can never do what she does.

27:30.408 --> 27:32.234
Then activate our source in the FBI.

27:32.289 --> 27:34.768
No. I won't risk burning
our most valuable asset

27:34.826 --> 27:36.554
just to quell your anxiety.

27:47.423 --> 27:48.956
We have a problem.

27:50.594 --> 27:52.398
Cade's been sighted.

27:55.355 --> 27:56.774
Do you have a second?

27:58.034 --> 27:58.810
Not really.

27:58.850 --> 28:01.091
You think I want to be here
any more than you want it?

28:01.126 --> 28:03.057
It's hard for me, too.

28:03.092 --> 28:04.482
Look, we...

28:04.630 --> 28:08.638
We can't change what happened
between us, on either side.

28:08.681 --> 28:11.456
I wish we could, but we can't.

28:11.581 --> 28:13.118
So we need to move forward.

28:13.153 --> 28:14.989
What do you think I'm
trying to do in there, Jane?

28:15.013 --> 28:16.794
It's gonna take time.

28:16.889 --> 28:18.722
It's not gonna happen overnight.

28:26.270 --> 28:29.590
Why haven't you told anybody
that you found Taylor's body?

28:29.693 --> 28:32.589
I searched her name,
and nothing new comes up.

28:39.936 --> 28:43.020
I exhumed her body in
secret and buried her.

28:43.099 --> 28:45.585
Somewhere peaceful.

28:48.071 --> 28:50.008
My team knows.

28:50.699 --> 28:52.519
Sarah knows.

28:53.535 --> 28:55.507
Taylor's family is gone now.

28:57.423 --> 28:59.307
And so is her killer.

29:00.013 --> 29:03.598
So I don't see what good the
truth will do anyone else.

29:04.040 --> 29:09.213
So let the horror of what
my father did die with him.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.261
I miss her.

29:18.355 --> 29:20.471
You didn't know her, Jane.

29:20.506 --> 29:22.473
No, I mean, I...

29:23.597 --> 29:25.649
I miss being her.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.321
And maybe that's a horrible
thing to say to you,

29:28.345 --> 29:30.193
but we're trying to be honest

29:30.258 --> 29:32.759
with each other now, right?

29:33.136 --> 29:35.740
Well, that's the truth.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.316
I miss being Taylor Shaw.

29:39.222 --> 29:41.730
And I understand you not wanting
to be in the same room with me

29:41.765 --> 29:43.607
because if I were you,
I would hate me, too.

29:43.650 --> 29:44.650
I don't ha...

29:46.899 --> 29:49.259
I don't hate you, Jane.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.423
I just don't know who you are anymore.

29:53.143 --> 29:55.779
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

29:57.988 --> 30:01.375
Hey... sorry. Sorry. Uh...

30:01.410 --> 30:04.754
The NSA just ran my algorithm,
and it found Kingston's van.

30:04.789 --> 30:06.419
- Where?
- Hunter's Point in Brooklyn.

30:06.454 --> 30:09.772
It's a pretty exposed place to do
a weapons deal with the drug cartel.

30:09.834 --> 30:11.004
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

30:11.039 --> 30:13.897
What if that's not where
they're just buying the missiles?

30:13.959 --> 30:16.179
What if that's where
they're planning to use them?

30:16.229 --> 30:17.882
What's in range from there?

30:17.917 --> 30:20.051
The Mexican consulate, the U.N.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.253
The whole East Side of Manhattan.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.596
We need to consider evacuating.

30:40.631 --> 30:41.973
Evacuating what?

30:42.038 --> 30:43.726
The entire East Side of Manhattan?

30:43.764 --> 30:45.591
Yeah, what are we supposed to
tell 'em? Go to the West Side?

30:45.615 --> 30:49.280
She's right, there's too
many targets, not enough time.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.831
It's up to us.

30:50.912 --> 30:53.714
What is that? What am I hearing?

30:53.749 --> 30:55.733
Airplane headed to LaGuardia.

30:55.789 --> 30:57.678
What if the cartel's
target's not a building?

30:57.717 --> 31:01.993
Hunter's Point is directly under
flight paths from LaGuardia and JFK.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.512
Could a stinger missile take out a plane?

31:04.595 --> 31:06.408
Within line-of-sight?
Definitely.

31:06.443 --> 31:10.948
Patterson, find out if anyone important
is flying in and out of New York right now.

31:10.983 --> 31:12.699
- On it.
- I'll contact the FAA.

31:12.757 --> 31:14.488
Get them to start grounding
and rerouting flights

31:14.512 --> 31:16.896
until we can neutralize the threat.

31:17.241 --> 31:18.574
What's that up ahead?

31:19.159 --> 31:20.508
This is the FBI!

31:20.554 --> 31:23.147
Stay where you are and
put down your weapons!

31:29.856 --> 31:30.856
Uhh!

31:33.354 --> 31:34.622
They're getting away with the missiles!

31:34.646 --> 31:36.896
Reade! Tasha! We'll cover you!

31:36.931 --> 31:39.062
- Get 'em!
- On it!

31:45.816 --> 31:47.621
Uhh!

31:47.623 --> 31:49.290
Argh!

31:49.515 --> 31:50.515
All right...

31:51.194 --> 31:52.216
Those must be the missile remotes!

31:52.240 --> 31:53.272
Let's go!

32:00.582 --> 32:04.133
Guys, there's a flight about to
land at LaGuardia from Mexico City.

32:04.167 --> 32:08.377
There's 14 politicians and law
enforcement officials on board.

32:08.455 --> 32:10.895
It's already overhead.
It's too late to reroute it.

32:11.826 --> 32:13.008
Good to know!

32:14.235 --> 32:15.587
He's got the remote!

32:18.774 --> 32:19.823
Agh!

32:24.911 --> 32:26.661
Agh! Uhh!

32:26.696 --> 32:28.667
He's locking on to the
plane with the remote!

32:40.830 --> 32:42.196
Oh, my God.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.014
Jane! Grab the remote!

32:53.982 --> 32:55.677
Put it in the water!

32:55.778 --> 32:56.778
Drop it.

33:03.299 --> 33:04.483
Nice work.

33:10.249 --> 33:12.067
Holy hell.

33:12.125 --> 33:14.060
We actually did it.

33:14.137 --> 33:15.737
We always do.

33:16.150 --> 33:18.762
I mean, you know, so far.

33:34.669 --> 33:36.503
Nice work out there.

33:36.564 --> 33:38.781
See what happens when
you stay out of my way?

33:40.815 --> 33:42.509
How's Valentine?

33:43.020 --> 33:46.967
She's in post-op. She's gonna
live, but she won't walk.

33:48.728 --> 33:50.826
You did not make the wrong call.

33:51.299 --> 33:53.566
You told her not to engage, she disobeyed.

33:53.631 --> 33:56.779
She's trained DEA, Weller.
She knew the risks, that's...

33:56.836 --> 33:58.335
That's not on you.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.243
Thank you.

34:04.948 --> 34:06.520
Good work today.

34:07.036 --> 34:08.437
Everyone.

34:08.998 --> 34:11.360
Look, Valentine said
she confided in a friend

34:11.434 --> 34:13.882
at the Department of
Justice, Keith Manning.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.391
We've been able to trace
backwards and determine

34:16.466 --> 34:19.505
Manning was the one who fed
Sandstorm the gun-waltzing intel.

34:19.572 --> 34:21.172
And based on his placement in the DOJ,

34:21.226 --> 34:22.337
it looks like he was responsible

34:22.360 --> 34:25.562
for at least one other
tattoo... the body cam case.

34:26.217 --> 34:27.994
Look, I know we've had our clashes,

34:28.042 --> 34:29.357
but I wanted you all to see this.

34:29.380 --> 34:32.701
So not only did we stop a missile
from blowing up a plane over Manhattan,

34:32.766 --> 34:34.984
we turned over a card in
Sandstorm's organization.

34:35.018 --> 34:36.766
Mm-hmm, the intel on Jane's body

34:36.802 --> 34:38.552
seems to have come from a number of sources

34:38.587 --> 34:40.685
from within the public and private sector.

34:40.737 --> 34:42.377
We've ID'd a few of them already.

34:42.445 --> 34:44.244
So, we keep following these tattoos

34:44.306 --> 34:46.507
until we track down
the rest of the sources.

34:46.556 --> 34:48.239
Then we'll swoop in.

34:48.281 --> 34:51.065
Hopefully take down all of
Sandstorm's people in one hit.

34:51.277 --> 34:53.056
That's a bit of an oversimplification,

34:53.123 --> 34:55.724
but, yes, we are making progress.

34:56.672 --> 34:58.171
See you guys tomorrow.

35:03.708 --> 35:05.875
You still wondering who the good guys are?

35:06.582 --> 35:08.060
Look, it's true.

35:08.095 --> 35:11.529
Sandstorm helped us prevent
a major disaster today.

35:12.231 --> 35:14.899
But every action that we take here

35:14.934 --> 35:17.484
creates massive ripples across the globe.

35:19.316 --> 35:21.677
Airline stocks plummeted.

35:21.712 --> 35:25.613
The gun-waltzing scandal put a
chill on U.S.-Mexican relations.

35:25.674 --> 35:28.007
The Juarez cartel has been weakened,

35:28.057 --> 35:30.500
which strengthens its competitors.

35:30.535 --> 35:34.287
We have no idea why Sandstorm
wanted us to do this today.

35:34.427 --> 35:37.078
So we can't see the complete picture yet.

35:37.113 --> 35:39.280
Because your family doesn't want us to.

35:40.825 --> 35:42.895
Ask yourself why that is.

35:51.467 --> 35:53.286
You gonna talk to Freddy?

35:53.358 --> 35:55.859
Can't we just stop another
missile attack or something?

35:56.336 --> 35:59.446
You did your best. He'll know that.

36:01.167 --> 36:02.750
Thanks, Zapata.

36:24.792 --> 36:27.101
Antibiotic ointment with a painkiller.

36:27.487 --> 36:29.869
No such thing as a minor gunshot wound.

36:29.918 --> 36:31.451
They all hurt like hell.

36:31.710 --> 36:33.210
Thank you.

36:37.498 --> 36:39.345
Sorry I shot you.

36:42.297 --> 36:44.097
I did ask for it.

36:44.847 --> 36:45.787
Yeah.

36:45.854 --> 36:47.688
You kind of did.

37:15.107 --> 37:16.992
Wow.

37:17.562 --> 37:19.262
This is a nice surprise.

37:19.364 --> 37:22.057
Yeah... I was just uh,
ahem, in the neighborhood

37:22.092 --> 37:25.226
and thought I'd stop
by, see how you're doing.

37:27.356 --> 37:29.060
Now I see.

37:29.950 --> 37:31.449
Can I buy you a drink?

37:32.694 --> 37:34.394
Think I'll pass.

37:35.293 --> 37:36.637
What are you doing here?

37:36.685 --> 37:38.769
- Is it about...
- I'm pregnant.

37:41.965 --> 37:44.883
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you sooner, I just...

37:45.003 --> 37:46.412
I don't know, you had so much going on

37:46.436 --> 37:49.245
with Mayfair... your dad.

37:51.646 --> 37:53.146
Three months?

37:54.513 --> 37:57.675
Well, the truth is, I'm not
great at this stuff, okay?

37:57.748 --> 37:59.470
And I was scared.

38:01.313 --> 38:05.187
This is gonna be your
kid, too... all right?

38:05.239 --> 38:07.614
I'm not looking for an
answer any time soon,

38:07.649 --> 38:10.697
and I'm truly not suggesting
that we get back together,

38:10.759 --> 38:13.011
'cause I don't think we should, but...

38:14.541 --> 38:16.032
if you want to be a
part of this kid's life,

38:16.056 --> 38:19.318
I will make sure that there
is space for that to happen.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.595
You know what my mom used to say to me...

38:21.630 --> 38:22.963
when I was young?

38:23.088 --> 38:25.054
Before she took off.

38:27.316 --> 38:29.567
"You're just like your father."

38:35.065 --> 38:37.098
You're gonna be a great mom.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.743
Thanks.

38:46.683 --> 38:48.257
Good night, Kurt.

38:49.258 --> 38:50.841
Good night.

39:04.504 --> 39:06.144
Freddy!

39:06.205 --> 39:07.664
There you are, man.

39:07.714 --> 39:09.555
Guys thought you left already.

39:09.590 --> 39:11.392
Punched out a little early.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.990
You spoke to the D.A.

39:15.745 --> 39:18.079
Guess I'm not such a
star witness after all.

39:18.284 --> 39:20.376
Man, this is not how I
wanted you to find out.

39:20.434 --> 39:21.796
You know, for a second
there, I actually thought

39:21.820 --> 39:23.912
something good was gonna come out of this.

39:25.384 --> 39:26.934
Nothing ever changes.

39:33.163 --> 39:35.662
Freddy... in cases this old,

39:35.697 --> 39:37.884
credible testimony is the
biggest weapon we have.

39:37.919 --> 39:40.326
We just couldn't find enough victims
to come forward, and the ones who did...

39:40.350 --> 39:42.233
Weren't credible.

39:42.338 --> 39:43.570
No, that's not what I was gonna say.

39:43.594 --> 39:45.289
It's cool, man, I get it.

39:45.479 --> 39:47.478
That's the great thing
about messing with kids.

39:47.582 --> 39:49.787
Your victims cover your tracks for you.

39:50.574 --> 39:52.337
Freddy, man...

39:53.513 --> 39:55.277
What about you?

39:55.422 --> 39:57.193
What about me?

39:57.247 --> 40:00.338
Mr. FBI man isn't a
credible enough witness?

40:00.392 --> 40:01.635
What are you talking about?

40:01.690 --> 40:03.524
Why aren't you testifying?

40:04.394 --> 40:06.973
Testifying about what?
I never saw anything.

40:07.081 --> 40:08.946
Saw anything? You were there.

40:09.548 --> 40:10.728
Where?

40:11.929 --> 40:13.787
What the hell are you talking about?

40:15.728 --> 40:16.986
You don't remember.

40:17.036 --> 40:19.120
Remember what, Freddy?

40:20.271 --> 40:21.888
That's why you so
together, why you not still

40:21.912 --> 40:23.580
down in the basement with the rest of us,

40:23.615 --> 40:24.807
watching our game tapes with him.

40:24.831 --> 40:27.916
You actually don't remember, do you, Edgar?

40:41.463 --> 40:44.119
_

40:51.160 --> 40:53.317
You're my starting point.
