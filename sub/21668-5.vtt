00:00.341 --> 00:02.340
(Male announcer) Previously
on Hell's Kitchen...

00:02.341 --> 00:03.606
She's not gonna get better.
She sucks.

00:03.607 --> 00:05.173
(Announcer) Elise took aim
at Carrie once again.

00:05.174 --> 00:07.734
Shut up. I'm talking.
I'm tired of hearing you talk.

00:07.735 --> 00:08.374
Whatever.

00:08.452 --> 00:10.350
And Krupa had the nerve
to say anything.

00:10.351 --> 00:12.151
(Announcer) But then she went
after another target... Krupa.

00:12.152 --> 00:15.151
I said your naan bread
was a piece of [Bleep].

00:15.152 --> 00:15.918
Keep your [Bleep] opinions
to yourself.

00:15.919 --> 00:17.384
No. No.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.250
(Announcer) In the creative
chicken challenge...

00:19.251 --> 00:20.783
- It was all down to the last dish.
- It's beautiful.

00:20.784 --> 00:22.050
The colors pop.

00:22.051 --> 00:24.383
(Announcer) Elise put her
cooking where her mouth is...

00:24.384 --> 00:26.283
Congratulations goes to
the Red Team.

00:26.284 --> 00:27.986
(Announcer) And, along
with Elizabeth,

00:27.987 --> 00:29.688
clinched the victory
for the Red Team.

00:29.689 --> 00:30.251
I won!

00:30.252 --> 00:32.183
(Announcer) Then during
dinner service...

00:32.183 --> 00:34.083
In the blue kitchen,
Monterray had issues

00:34.084 --> 00:35.211
with the fish station...

00:35.212 --> 00:37.083
It fell apart. There's nothing I can do.
It fell apart.

00:37.084 --> 00:38.085
(Announcer) And sous chef Scott.

00:38.086 --> 00:39.684
Do it! [Bleep] You.

00:39.685 --> 00:41.083
Well, [Bleep] you too then.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.303
(Announcer) Chino was
a mess on the meat.

00:43.304 --> 00:44.284
Come here you.

00:44.285 --> 00:46.185
Look at that.
What have you done to this?

00:46.186 --> 00:47.853
Now you're just [Bleep].

00:47.854 --> 00:48.617
Yes, chef.

00:48.618 --> 00:50.216
(Announcer) And in
the red kitchen...

00:50.217 --> 00:51.383
I'm walking with scallops!

00:51.384 --> 00:52.818
(Announcer) The chefs
were completely

00:52.819 --> 00:53.759
out of sync.

00:53.760 --> 00:54.151
Wow.

00:54.152 --> 00:55.751
No. No. You need to calm down.

00:55.752 --> 00:57.217
(Elise) Whatever.

00:57.218 --> 00:58.751
You're so [Bleep] disrespectful.

00:58.752 --> 01:00.951
I'm here. You're here.
Get it straight.

01:00.952 --> 01:03.083
(Announcer) But it was Gina's
poor performance on meat...

01:03.084 --> 01:03.785
- What is that?
- It's raw, chef.

01:03.786 --> 01:05.684
I'd never have guessed.

01:05.685 --> 01:08.406
(Announcer) That brought the Red Team's
kitchen to a complete standstill.

01:08.407 --> 01:09.252
What an embarrassment.

01:09.253 --> 01:10.585
Just sit down.

01:13.218 --> 01:15.085
(Announcer) Both teams
lost and had to nominate.

01:15.086 --> 01:16.617
Have you come to a decision?

01:16.618 --> 01:17.883
(Announcer) The Blue Team chose...

01:17.884 --> 01:19.018
- Chino...
(Announcer) - And...

01:19.019 --> 01:20.317
Monterray.

01:20.318 --> 01:22.050
(Announcer)
- The Red Team selected... - Carrie.

01:22.051 --> 01:22.916
(Announcer) - And...
- Elise.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.350
If you had to drop Elise or Carrie,

01:24.351 --> 01:25.618
who would you drop?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.684
(All) Elise.

01:27.685 --> 01:29.717
Time for a difficult decision.

01:29.718 --> 01:31.851
(Announcer) In the end,
there was one performance

01:31.852 --> 01:32.952
chef Ramsay couldn't
forgive or forget.

01:32.953 --> 01:35.384
Chino. Give me your jacket.

01:35.385 --> 01:37.651
(Announcer) And that put
an end to Chino's dream

01:37.652 --> 01:39.417
of becoming head chef at BLT Steak

01:39.418 --> 01:41.418
in New York City.

(announcer) And now the
continuation of Hell's Kitchen...

02:46.818 --> 02:49.585
Now [Bleep] off, all of you.

02:52.118 --> 02:54.217
(Woman) Holy [Bleep] balls.

02:54.218 --> 02:57.017
Oh, my God, we have to deal
with this bitch again.

02:57.018 --> 02:59.717
Elise, she's got
problems with everybody.

02:59.718 --> 03:02.717
Her attitude is a huge
setback for the team.

03:02.718 --> 03:05.084
I just want the drama to stop.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.085
I'm [Bleep] embarrassed.

03:09.418 --> 03:10.552
I still love you, babe.

03:10.553 --> 03:12.384
I still love me too.

03:12.385 --> 03:14.917
I learned a valuable
lesson tonight.

03:14.918 --> 03:16.150
I see the strategy now.

03:16.151 --> 03:17.583
Let's cut the strongest one,

03:17.584 --> 03:19.450
you know what I mean?
It's cool, though.

03:19.451 --> 03:20.816
I ain't worried about it. Game on.

03:20.817 --> 03:22.018
If that's how we're gonna play

03:22.019 --> 03:23.717
the game and start trying

03:23.718 --> 03:25.716
to cut the competition,
well, let the games begin,

03:25.717 --> 03:27.252
'cause somebody's
going home next week,

03:27.253 --> 03:29.051
and it ain't gonna be me.

03:29.052 --> 03:31.318
- So you're pissed at me?
- Oh, I'm not pissed at you.

03:31.319 --> 03:33.551
I'm not pissed at all.
I'm happy to be here.

03:33.552 --> 03:35.652
I just know that I don't have
any friends in this house.

03:35.653 --> 03:38.251
It's not about being friends.
It's about professionalism.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.151
But I'm a better cook than she is.

03:40.152 --> 03:41.850
Why would you want to
keep somebody weaker

03:41.851 --> 03:43.416
on your team when you're
trying to win challenges?

03:43.417 --> 03:45.052
Because your mouth
gets us in trouble

03:45.053 --> 03:46.684
every service, that's why.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.451
(Elise) Yes, I have a big mouth.

03:48.452 --> 03:50.083
The person I bicker with
the most here is Carrie.

03:50.084 --> 03:51.885
And if we're both
up for elimination,

03:51.886 --> 03:54.017
why wouldn't you just
want to cut the bickering

03:54.018 --> 03:55.516
and keep on winning, 'cause
I'm a [Bleep] winner.

03:55.517 --> 03:56.285
And I'll sit here and
say that all day.

03:56.286 --> 03:57.617
Am I modest? No.

03:57.618 --> 03:59.984
Because I know what I've
been through, I know

03:59.985 --> 04:01.383
where I came from, and I know
how I started in this [Bleep].

04:01.384 --> 04:02.652
And I'm not gonna stop now.

04:02.653 --> 04:05.551
They just woke the sleeping giant.

04:05.552 --> 04:07.017
Watch out now.

04:07.018 --> 04:08.785
Like I said, I learned a
valuable lesson tonight.

04:08.786 --> 04:10.151
What was the lesson?

04:10.152 --> 04:11.385
Bring it on.

04:16.218 --> 04:18.084
(Man) Here we go.

04:18.084 --> 04:19.850
(Announcer) As a new day dawns,
the chefs were reminded

04:19.851 --> 04:21.052
once again that, in Hell's Kitchen,

04:21.053 --> 04:22.717
the one thing they can expect...

04:22.718 --> 04:23.884
(Woman) Wow.

04:23.885 --> 04:25.384
What have we got going on here?

04:25.385 --> 04:26.785
(Announcer) Is the unexpected.

04:32.152 --> 04:33.251
Oh, my God.

04:33.252 --> 04:34.383
There's chef Ramsay

04:34.384 --> 04:35.552
with Dr. Jekyll stuff

04:35.553 --> 04:37.184
going on behind him.

04:37.185 --> 04:38.518
Are we supposed to go out here?

04:38.519 --> 04:40.184
Come on. Let's go.

04:40.185 --> 04:41.917
Wow.

04:41.918 --> 04:43.883
It looked like a high
school chemistry lab.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.816
I have flashbacks
of dissecting frogs

04:45.817 --> 04:47.016
and worms and stuff.

04:47.017 --> 04:48.152
All right. Good morning.

04:48.153 --> 04:50.151
(All) Morning, chef.

04:50.152 --> 04:52.251
Today, I've invited two
very special chefs

04:52.252 --> 04:55.617
who have a unrivaled reputation
for bringing in science

04:55.618 --> 04:56.581
and food together.

04:56.582 --> 04:57.651
They work with NASA

04:57.652 --> 04:59.817
to create more exciting
food for the astronauts.

04:59.818 --> 05:00.917
What?

05:00.918 --> 05:02.052
They've even created

05:02.053 --> 05:03.352
a delicious frozen pizza

05:03.353 --> 05:06.084
that changes flavor

05:06.085 --> 05:07.452
- to a dessert as you eat it.
- Oh, my God.

05:07.453 --> 05:08.684
Wow.

05:08.685 --> 05:10.484
(Gordon) Please welcome chef Cantu

05:10.485 --> 05:11.552
and chef Roche.

05:14.118 --> 05:15.951
It's good to see you both.

05:15.952 --> 05:17.118
(Natalie) The guys from Moto

05:17.119 --> 05:18.551
are amazing.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.451
They do the craziest things

05:20.452 --> 05:21.652
I've ever seen done in a kitchen.

05:21.653 --> 05:22.817
[Giggles]

05:22.818 --> 05:24.784
- Ready?
(All) - Yes, chef.

05:24.785 --> 05:27.651
Watch closely. We're gonna
make you a dreamsicle sorbet.

05:27.652 --> 05:29.016
The first thing we're
gonna do is take

05:29.017 --> 05:30.283
this sound generator.

05:30.284 --> 05:32.452
We stick it in the orange.
Basically, it'll produce

05:32.453 --> 05:34.884
a 22,000 kilohertz sound.

05:34.885 --> 05:37.284
It takes the cell
structure of the orange

05:37.285 --> 05:39.484
and turns it into a liquid.

05:39.485 --> 05:42.184
We're just gonna pour
it into this bowl.

05:42.185 --> 05:44.617
That's crazy. I was astounded.

05:44.618 --> 05:46.217
Sound waves, dude?

05:46.218 --> 05:48.118
I mean, are you [Bleep]
kidding me, man?

05:48.119 --> 05:50.384
(Cantu) Next, a little
liquid nitrogen.

05:50.385 --> 05:52.016
The cool thing about
using liquid nitrogen

05:52.017 --> 05:53.218
is that it freezes so quickly.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.817
It's definitely dangerous.

05:54.818 --> 05:56.851
You can freeze and crack
your body part off.

05:56.852 --> 05:58.652
I really wanted to get my
hands on that [Bleep].

05:58.653 --> 06:00.751
Ice cream in 45 seconds.

06:00.752 --> 06:01.884
Yeah.

06:01.885 --> 06:03.917
This was, like, totally awesome.

06:03.918 --> 06:06.183
I would probably have done so
much better in chemistry class

06:06.184 --> 06:07.783
if chemistry class was
anything like this.

06:07.784 --> 06:08.918
(Gordon) Delicious.

06:08.919 --> 06:10.484
You've seen the cutting edge.

06:10.485 --> 06:12.484
But great chefs can
do amazing things

06:12.485 --> 06:14.317
with very little.

06:14.318 --> 06:17.917
And that is what your next
challenge is all about.

06:17.918 --> 06:19.984
We're going back to basics.

06:19.985 --> 06:21.351
Fire and water.

06:21.352 --> 06:25.352
You can steam, you can
boil, you can poach.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.452
All other cooking
methods are off-limits.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.951
- Ah.
(Man) - Wow.

06:29.952 --> 06:31.185
My mind went blank.

06:31.186 --> 06:32.717
I was fixing to get to use

06:32.718 --> 06:34.817
these things from the
future, you know?

06:34.818 --> 06:37.651
But I jumped in a time machine
and went back 100 years.

06:37.652 --> 06:39.884
(Gordon) Each team will be provided

06:39.885 --> 06:41.451
with six stunning proteins.

06:41.452 --> 06:43.217
Red Team, you have seven members,

06:43.218 --> 06:45.452
so you decide which protein
you want to make two of,

06:45.453 --> 06:47.717
and then, after you've cooked it,

06:47.718 --> 06:49.583
taste and decide which one
you're gonna present.

06:49.584 --> 06:50.752
- Got it?
(All) - Yes, chef.

06:50.753 --> 06:52.052
45 minutes to cook.

06:52.053 --> 06:53.617
Starting from...

06:53.618 --> 06:55.184
Now.

06:55.185 --> 06:56.616
(Announcer) In this challenge,

06:56.617 --> 06:58.083
each chef will have 45 minutes

06:58.084 --> 06:59.618
to create a unique
dish featuring one

06:59.619 --> 07:01.017
of six proteins.

07:01.018 --> 07:02.418
I'm taking the salmon.
I got the lobsters.

07:02.419 --> 07:03.751
I'll take veal.

07:03.752 --> 07:05.552
I'm taking the meat.
I'm doing Guinea hen.

07:05.553 --> 07:07.151
We're doubling up prawns.

07:07.152 --> 07:08.418
Carrie's doing it,
and I'm doing it.

07:08.419 --> 07:10.317
Let's set up over here.

07:10.318 --> 07:12.183
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay has
designed this unique challenge

07:12.184 --> 07:13.352
to test what the chefs can do

07:13.353 --> 07:16.284
when limited to cooking
with only fire and water.

07:16.285 --> 07:18.317
I have never done this
to a filet before.

07:18.318 --> 07:20.150
(Announcer) The team
that can steam,

07:20.151 --> 07:21.785
boil, and poach its way
to the most points

07:21.786 --> 07:23.151
wins the challenge.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.217
Oh, I was doing the
Guinea hen, Krupa.

07:25.218 --> 07:27.083
I grabbed that [Bleep] when
there was still two on there.

07:27.084 --> 07:28.785
Yeah, but I called it.
I called it earlier.

07:28.786 --> 07:30.284
(Woman) Guys!

07:30.285 --> 07:31.652
Bitch, get off my Guinea hen.

07:31.653 --> 07:33.185
[Scoffs]

07:34.352 --> 07:36.484
I chose veal.

07:36.485 --> 07:38.817
Kind of 'cause it's the
only thing that was left.

07:38.818 --> 07:40.851
I was very angry about that.

07:40.852 --> 07:42.517
This is [Bleep] [Bleep].

07:42.518 --> 07:44.885
Jamie, the only protein
we're missing now is veal.

07:44.886 --> 07:46.917
Nobody's doing veal?

07:46.918 --> 07:48.884
I am. Oh, she's doing veal.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.284
(Elizabeth) You all scared me.
I was like...

07:51.285 --> 07:53.652
Nervous that we were going to
be idiots missing a protein.

07:53.653 --> 07:56.651
(Announcer) While the Red Team seems
to clear up a little confusion

07:56.652 --> 07:57.984
over their proteins,

07:57.985 --> 07:59.917
in the blue kitchen, one chef...

07:59.918 --> 08:01.551
(Monterray) I'm stumped right now.

08:01.552 --> 08:03.417
(Announcer) Is clearly confused.

08:03.418 --> 08:05.083
Think I should break the prawns
down or leave 'em whole?

08:05.084 --> 08:07.018
I would leave 'em whole.
They look great.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.451
Yeah.

08:08.452 --> 08:09.916
I feel like this is so basic.

08:09.917 --> 08:10.983
(Natalie) We had plenty of time.

08:10.984 --> 08:11.983
I don't know how Monterray

08:11.984 --> 08:13.016
didn't know what he was doing.

08:13.017 --> 08:13.950
How much time we got?

08:13.951 --> 08:15.083
If you got to ask,

08:15.084 --> 08:16.318
it probably ain't that much.

08:18.385 --> 08:19.984
Oh, [Bleep], yeah.

08:19.985 --> 08:22.117
That tastes off the hook.

08:22.118 --> 08:24.717
My sauce is coming
out ridic-[Bleep].

08:24.718 --> 08:26.884
I think the judges are
gonna love this dish

08:26.885 --> 08:28.652
because the veal is gonna
be very flavorful.

08:28.653 --> 08:30.184
It's gonna be tender.

08:30.185 --> 08:32.451
Oh, oh, oh, Krupa just
[Bleep] a little bit.

08:32.452 --> 08:33.683
What? Ew.

08:33.684 --> 08:36.183
My [Bleep] tastes good.

08:36.184 --> 08:37.817
15 seconds to go.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.417
Gosh, that time went fast.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.049
Guys, let's go, get
'em in the windows.

08:41.051 --> 08:42.184
Got to move, got to move.

08:42.186 --> 08:46.185
(Gordon) Four, three, two, one,

08:46.785 --> 08:49.151
and serve.

08:49.152 --> 08:51.616
(Announcer) Before judging can
begin, the Red Team must choose

08:51.617 --> 08:53.485
which prawn dish
will be presented...

08:53.486 --> 08:55.017
Carrie's or Elizabeth's.

08:55.018 --> 08:56.651
(Elise) I like Liz's. Look at it.

08:56.652 --> 08:58.484
I like her presentation.

08:58.485 --> 09:01.317
Elise, you're saying
you like Elizabeth's.

09:01.318 --> 09:02.550
You haven't even tasted Carrie's.

09:02.551 --> 09:03.352
Exactly.

09:03.353 --> 09:05.051
Did I use my eyesight first

09:05.052 --> 09:06.584
before tasting? Yes, I did.

09:06.585 --> 09:09.384
Because Carrie has
disappointed us in the past.

09:09.385 --> 09:11.385
And I definitely don't want
to lose another challenge.

09:11.386 --> 09:13.151
(Carrie) I'm telling you, guys.

09:13.152 --> 09:14.816
Spinach, bell pepper, with a
white beurre blanc sauce.

09:14.817 --> 09:15.916
I don't like it.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.185
Whose dish are we dropping?

09:17.186 --> 09:18.684
(All) Carrie's, chef.

09:18.685 --> 09:20.451
Why are we dropping Carrie's?

09:20.452 --> 09:22.118
I think Elizabeth's tastes
good and looks better.

09:22.119 --> 09:24.317
We're choosing Elizabeth's dish.
That's fine.

09:24.318 --> 09:26.384
(Carrie) Even if I were
to fight for my dish,

09:26.385 --> 09:27.950
they still would have
put up Elizabeth's

09:27.951 --> 09:28.950
because I know how my team is.

09:28.951 --> 09:30.016
They don't have any faith in me.

09:30.017 --> 09:31.252
They don't believe in me.

09:31.253 --> 09:33.817
Here we go.
Fire, water, and protein.

09:33.818 --> 09:35.451
First, the filet mignon.

09:35.452 --> 09:37.251
Let's go. All right, Jonathon.

09:37.252 --> 09:39.417
(Announcer) First up
with their dishes,

09:39.418 --> 09:40.416
Jennifer and Jonathon.

09:40.417 --> 09:41.585
Jonathon, please.

09:41.586 --> 09:43.751
Chefs, I basically went

09:43.752 --> 09:45.016
back to the basics.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.418
Meat, potatoes, and vegetables.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.484
How far'd you go back?

09:48.485 --> 09:50.317
Visually, it's a train wreck.

09:50.318 --> 09:51.551
[Laughter]

09:51.552 --> 09:53.484
(Roche) Definitely doesn't look

09:53.485 --> 09:56.217
like restaurant-caliber visually.

09:56.218 --> 09:58.251
But, you know, looks
can be deceiving.

09:58.252 --> 10:00.684
The beef is cooked wonderfully.

10:00.685 --> 10:02.117
Thank you.

10:02.118 --> 10:04.151
It may look like a bit
of a train wreck,

10:04.152 --> 10:05.716
but it was the best-tasting
[Bleep] train wreck

10:05.717 --> 10:07.185
you'll ever experience, man.

10:07.186 --> 10:08.551
Jennifer.

10:08.552 --> 10:10.385
(Jennifer) It's a
basil ponzu sauce.

10:10.386 --> 10:13.151
I'd never cooked meat
in broth before, so...

10:13.152 --> 10:15.118
I think you actually
nailed the texture.

10:15.119 --> 10:17.118
The fact that you've never
boiled beef before...

10:17.119 --> 10:17.545
Never.

10:17.546 --> 10:19.921
And you executed that
that well, bravo.

10:19.922 --> 10:21.817
Thank you, chef.

10:21.818 --> 10:23.684
Gents? It's a close one.

10:23.685 --> 10:25.918
I would say, by putting forth
a little bit more thought

10:25.919 --> 10:28.684
in the idea of visually presenting,

10:28.685 --> 10:30.751
I'm gonna go with Red Team.

10:30.752 --> 10:32.784
- Red Team, congratulations.
- Thank you, chef.

10:32.785 --> 10:34.617
You nailed it. Good job, Jennifer.

10:34.618 --> 10:36.919
(Announcer) With the red
team leading by one,

10:36.920 --> 10:38.518
Monterray and Elizabeth
are ready to show

10:38.519 --> 10:42.184
what they've done with just
fire, water, and prawns.

10:42.185 --> 10:43.785
I have a prawns with eggs Benedict.

10:43.786 --> 10:46.051
(Gordon) Prawns eggs Benedict?

10:46.052 --> 10:47.784
Prawns are definitely seasoned,

10:47.785 --> 10:48.783
but they're just really overcooked.

10:48.784 --> 10:50.085
(Gordon) Oh, God, they're hard.

10:50.086 --> 10:51.751
They're solid.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.117
Monterray's dish was a hot mess.

10:54.118 --> 10:55.751
He had very overcooked prawns

10:55.752 --> 10:57.251
and he did it with eggs Benedict?

10:57.252 --> 10:58.718
I mean, that's not gonna work.

10:58.719 --> 11:01.251
Today, I made for you
spaghetti with prawns.

11:01.252 --> 11:03.551
I just tossed it in olive oil.

11:03.552 --> 11:05.484
The seasoning needs a lot of work.

11:05.485 --> 11:06.783
(Gordon) I'm disappointed.

11:06.784 --> 11:07.852
I expected more.

11:07.853 --> 11:10.151
- Can I taste yours, please?
- Yes, chef.

11:10.152 --> 11:11.184
Yeah?

11:11.185 --> 11:13.151
Thank you.

11:13.152 --> 11:16.584
Back in line, please.

11:16.585 --> 11:18.885
I think I would have preferred
this to that one, actually.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.551
(Gordon) Mm-hmm.
You got a great dish.

11:21.552 --> 11:22.918
It gives that vibrance
in the mouth.

11:22.919 --> 11:24.517
Thank you, chef.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.217
I'm like, "hell yeah. Uh-huh.

11:26.218 --> 11:28.251
Eat your heart out, girls."

11:28.252 --> 11:29.717
Screw them.

11:29.718 --> 11:32.084
Gents, it's too bad they
didn't present this one,

11:32.085 --> 11:33.683
because that one
actually tastes better.

11:33.684 --> 11:34.918
What a disappointment.

11:34.919 --> 11:37.851
No points to either team.

11:37.852 --> 11:39.584
It's all right.

11:39.585 --> 11:42.417
(Announcer) Up next with the
salmon dishes, it's Jamie...

11:42.418 --> 11:44.852
(Jamie) Poached salmon with
a citrus jasmine rice.

11:44.853 --> 11:47.251
I do think that the salmon
is pretty overcooked.

11:47.252 --> 11:49.117
(Announcer) Versus will.

11:49.118 --> 11:51.217
(Will) I cooked the egg
over a double boiler

11:51.218 --> 11:52.816
like they did back
in the olden days.

11:52.817 --> 11:53.852
The textural components
and the flavors

11:53.853 --> 11:55.717
work really nicely together.

11:55.718 --> 11:57.652
- Thank you, chef.
(Gordon) - You're absolutely right.

11:57.653 --> 11:59.152
Congratulations, Blue Team.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.817
(Woman) Good job, Will.

12:00.818 --> 12:02.485
(Announcer) The score is tied at 1,

12:02.486 --> 12:04.485
and it's time for the
Guinea hens with Gina...

12:04.486 --> 12:07.151
Lightly poached Guinea hen
breast with some mushrooms.

12:07.152 --> 12:08.652
I thought the mushrooms
with the puree,

12:08.653 --> 12:10.051
nice combination.

12:10.052 --> 12:11.651
- Thank you.
(Announcer) - And Tommy.

12:11.652 --> 12:14.017
Got a poached chicken
leg and a breast.

12:14.018 --> 12:15.517
There's just a lot going on here.

12:15.518 --> 12:16.652
Why would you serve the leg

12:16.653 --> 12:18.184
and the breast at the same time?

12:18.185 --> 12:18.983
I don't really think
when I do things.

12:18.984 --> 12:20.050
I just do them.

12:20.051 --> 12:21.285
I think with this,

12:21.286 --> 12:23.384
less would have been more.

12:23.385 --> 12:24.750
Gents, Red Team or Blue Team?

12:24.751 --> 12:25.418
I'm gonna go with Red Team.

12:25.419 --> 12:26.917
Red Team.

12:26.918 --> 12:28.285
Congratulations, Red Team.
Good job.

12:28.286 --> 12:29.617
Thank you, chef.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.084
I got the point!

12:31.085 --> 12:33.451
I'm like, "yes!" Thank God!

12:33.452 --> 12:35.216
Next up, the battle of the lobster.

12:35.217 --> 12:36.952
(Announcer) With the
Red Team up by 1,

12:36.953 --> 12:39.517
Elise is looking to
seal the victory...

12:39.518 --> 12:41.351
Poached in a beurre monte sauce.

12:41.352 --> 12:43.251
- It is a little rubbery.
- Yeah.

12:43.252 --> 12:45.152
(Announcer) While Paul
hopes to tie it up.

12:45.153 --> 12:47.684
Citrus poached butter lobster.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.351
Bravo. Thank you, chef.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.685
Congratulations, Blue Team.
Well done.

12:50.686 --> 12:51.685
Thanks, chef.

12:51.686 --> 12:53.451
(Man) Paulie! Whoof!

12:53.452 --> 12:54.851
Good job, Paul.

12:54.852 --> 12:56.716
(Announcer) Now with
the score tied at 2,

12:56.717 --> 12:57.552
it all comes down
to the veal dishes.

12:57.553 --> 13:00.451
It's Natalie versus Krupa.

13:00.452 --> 13:03.684
I made a veal terrine
wrapped in greens.

13:03.685 --> 13:05.184
Don't take it personally,

13:05.185 --> 13:06.450
but the terrine kind of comes off

13:06.451 --> 13:08.385
as having like that
cat food texture.

13:08.386 --> 13:10.884
Meow. [Laughs]

13:10.885 --> 13:12.417
The flavors are lacking seasoning

13:12.418 --> 13:13.352
and proper cooking technique.

13:13.353 --> 13:14.884
Not good. Not good at all.

13:14.885 --> 13:17.017
[Bleep].

13:17.018 --> 13:18.517
Krupa, let's go.

13:18.518 --> 13:20.852
So everyone knows how much
I love my comfort food,

13:20.853 --> 13:24.852
so we've got poached veal in,
like, a delicious broth.

13:25.752 --> 13:27.517
Visually it's pretty bad.

13:27.518 --> 13:28.618
I'm just gonna close my
eyes and taste it, so...

13:28.619 --> 13:31.251
[Chuckles]

13:31.252 --> 13:32.683
Not surprisingly, it tastes
a hell of a lot better

13:32.684 --> 13:33.518
than it looks.

13:33.519 --> 13:36.551
I've got to work on that.

13:36.552 --> 13:37.984
I think it... it...

13:37.985 --> 13:39.352
Has the flavor
reminiscent of, like,

13:39.353 --> 13:41.284
a good beef stew.

13:41.285 --> 13:43.117
Yeah. Whew!

13:43.118 --> 13:44.352
It actually tastes quite nice.

13:44.353 --> 13:45.684
I mean, it's delicious.

13:45.685 --> 13:48.417
But I have one big
issue with that dish.

13:48.418 --> 13:50.717
And it's not funny.

13:50.718 --> 13:54.185
Oh, no.

13:58.564 --> 14:00.564
(Announcer) In this challenge,
the chefs were confined

14:00.565 --> 14:02.463
to just using fire and water.

14:02.464 --> 14:04.963
The score is tied at 2
and it all comes down

14:04.964 --> 14:06.397
to Natalie's veal dish...

14:06.398 --> 14:07.963
The terrine kind of comes off

14:07.964 --> 14:09.297
as having like that
cat food texture.

14:09.298 --> 14:10.796
Meow.

14:10.797 --> 14:12.662
(Announcer) Versus
Krupa's veal dish.

14:12.663 --> 14:13.928
Tastes a hell of a lot
better than it looks.

14:13.929 --> 14:14.964
It's delicious,

14:14.965 --> 14:17.329
but I have one big
issue with that dish.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.429
And it's not funny,
especially in front

14:19.430 --> 14:20.863
of esteemed judges.

14:20.864 --> 14:23.363
That, madam...

14:23.364 --> 14:24.396
Is not veal.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.196
That's filet mignon.

14:26.197 --> 14:27.829
Oh, no.

14:27.830 --> 14:30.929
Carrie, go and get me
the veal in there.

14:30.930 --> 14:32.863
Quickly. Hurry up.

14:32.864 --> 14:35.095
(Krupa) I don't know what
possessed me to grab the filet

14:35.096 --> 14:36.330
and not the veal.

14:36.331 --> 14:38.396
And I know the difference.

14:38.397 --> 14:40.330
(Carrie) Jamie, the only protein
we're missing now is veal.

14:40.331 --> 14:42.096
- Nobody's doing veal?
- I am.

14:42.097 --> 14:43.530
- Oh, she's doing veal.
- Yup.

14:43.531 --> 14:45.496
Thank you very much.

14:45.497 --> 14:48.029
(Krupa) I just wanted
to crawl under a rock.

14:48.030 --> 14:51.663
I'm very, very ticked
off at myself.

14:51.664 --> 14:53.530
Don't you know the
difference between

14:53.531 --> 14:55.729
a filet mignon and a
[Bleep] side of veal?

14:55.730 --> 14:57.463
I screwed up.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.297
And throughout the
whole 45 minutes,

14:59.298 --> 15:01.929
no one noticed it
wasn't being used?

15:01.930 --> 15:03.496
And in front of my guests.

15:03.497 --> 15:06.096
How dare you!

15:06.097 --> 15:09.264
Red Team, Blue Team, no points.
Back in line.

15:11.597 --> 15:14.729
I'm so embarrassed.

15:14.730 --> 15:16.729
We have a tie.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.296
But Red Team, two big mistakes.

15:18.297 --> 15:20.263
The screw-up on the veal.

15:20.264 --> 15:23.463
Secondly, the best dish sat

15:23.464 --> 15:25.563
on the side.

15:25.564 --> 15:28.829
There's no way on earth I can
have you winning this challenge.

15:28.830 --> 15:30.028
Blue Team, congratulations.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.197
Yeah! Thank you, chef.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.596
Well done. Damn it.

15:33.597 --> 15:35.428
Thank you so much for
joining us, yeah.

15:35.429 --> 15:36.595
Look forward to
seeing you in Chicago

15:36.596 --> 15:37.097
at that amazing restaurant.

15:37.098 --> 15:38.863
Take care.

15:38.864 --> 15:40.563
I'm pissed off right now.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.429
I didn't win this challenge,
but the weakest dish

15:43.430 --> 15:45.063
was definitely Krupa.

15:45.064 --> 15:46.497
It sucks losing a challenge.

15:46.498 --> 15:48.929
It sucks being punished. [Sighs]

15:48.930 --> 15:52.363
Okay, as for today's challenge
was all about fire and water.

15:52.364 --> 15:54.163
Both teams are getting wet.

15:54.164 --> 15:56.829
Blue Team, your reward...

15:56.830 --> 15:58.863
You all are going

15:58.864 --> 16:01.229
to one of the finest
spas in Beverly hills.

16:01.230 --> 16:04.696
Oh, yes. Wow.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.463
Relax, chill, and sit back.

16:07.464 --> 16:08.563
Sound great.

16:08.564 --> 16:09.963
Man, a spa?

16:09.964 --> 16:13.996
Dude, I love [Bleep] massages.

16:13.997 --> 16:15.896
Red Team, trust me.

16:15.897 --> 16:18.763
You will definitely
be getting wet...

16:18.764 --> 16:21.063
Because you'll be up to your elbows

16:21.064 --> 16:23.796
scrubbing the hot tub

16:23.797 --> 16:25.596
and cleaning that amazing fountain

16:25.597 --> 16:28.096
at the front of Hell's
Kitchen's entrance.

16:28.097 --> 16:30.096
Oh, come on.

16:30.097 --> 16:31.729
(Gordon) One more thing.

16:31.730 --> 16:33.396
You'll be prepping both kitchens

16:33.397 --> 16:35.196
ahead of tonight's service.

16:35.197 --> 16:36.296
That's right.

16:36.297 --> 16:38.329
We are open for dinner tonight.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.596
Got it?

16:39.597 --> 16:41.296
- Yes, chef.
- Way to go, girls.

16:41.297 --> 16:42.707
Way to have faith in Carrie.

16:42.708 --> 16:43.463
Appreciate it.

16:43.464 --> 16:44.629
This blows.

16:44.630 --> 16:45.663
Blue Team,

16:45.664 --> 16:46.964
your massage tables await you.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.863
Off you go. Enjoy.

16:49.864 --> 16:51.095
Ladies, up to the door.

16:51.096 --> 16:52.397
James and Andy will call you.

16:52.398 --> 16:55.063
Oh, I feel like [Bleep] right now.

16:55.064 --> 16:57.263
We needed this win
like we need air.

16:57.264 --> 17:00.663
And a spa is probably the best
prize we could have gotten

17:00.664 --> 17:01.963
and we lost it.

17:01.964 --> 17:04.096
This is about to be
the worst day ever.

17:04.097 --> 17:05.728
How do you not know the
difference between

17:05.729 --> 17:06.730
filet and veal?

17:06.731 --> 17:08.262
It was clearly a veal

17:08.263 --> 17:11.463
with the freaking bone
and everything on it.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.496
I'm really pissed because
it was a tie breaker

17:13.497 --> 17:14.464
and the reason we lost
is because of Krupa.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.663
I know.

17:16.664 --> 17:18.994
No, I don't think we're gonna
argue about that [Bleep].

17:18.996 --> 17:20.662
I'm just gonna be kicking
myself for a while

17:20.663 --> 17:22.130
for the stupid mistake I made.

17:22.131 --> 17:24.128
I'm so pissed off at myself.

17:24.130 --> 17:27.663
I am sorry about that.

17:27.664 --> 17:30.062
(Announcer) While the red
team licks their wounds,

17:30.063 --> 17:32.464
the Blue Team is off for
an afternoon of pampering.

17:36.530 --> 17:38.930
(Natalie) Oh, my gosh.
This is crazy.

17:40.997 --> 17:42.496
Ooh!

17:42.497 --> 17:43.996
Whoa!

17:43.997 --> 17:45.529
All right. How you doing?

17:45.530 --> 17:46.797
Good afternoon.
Welcome to the club.

17:46.798 --> 17:49.829
[Overlapping chatter]

17:49.830 --> 17:51.795
(Man) Tommy, you just
fit in so well here.

17:51.796 --> 17:52.895
I know. I know.

17:52.896 --> 17:54.295
Oh, I feel right at home.

17:54.296 --> 17:55.728
I've never been to
a spa in my life.

17:55.729 --> 17:57.164
I was totally out of my element.

17:57.165 --> 17:59.596
We have a fun day of
relaxation and pampering.

17:59.597 --> 18:02.096
Are people gonna put hot
stones in my ass cheeks?

18:02.097 --> 18:03.262
Like, really weird.

18:03.263 --> 18:04.730
Like, just strange all around.

18:04.731 --> 18:06.563
Ooh, it's really hot. Whoa!

18:06.564 --> 18:07.996
This feels so good.

18:07.997 --> 18:09.264
(Tommy) I don't care
about mineral baths

18:09.265 --> 18:10.729
and foot massages

18:10.730 --> 18:13.596
and rich people.

18:13.597 --> 18:16.296
[Laughter]

18:16.297 --> 18:18.164
But, um, you wouldn't
have to sell me

18:18.165 --> 18:19.996
on the idea of getting used to it.

18:19.997 --> 18:21.896
Aw, man! Aw, that feels good.

18:21.897 --> 18:25.129
(Natalie) Yeah, I
definitely needed this.

18:25.130 --> 18:28.063
The boys get their spa.
We get our spa.

18:28.064 --> 18:30.796
Yeah.

18:30.797 --> 18:32.797
I can't believe we actually
have dinner service tonight.

18:32.798 --> 18:34.696
I'm, like, shocked.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.396
It sucks, like, doing all this
work and losing the challenge

18:37.397 --> 18:39.364
and then rolling right
into a dinner service.

18:39.365 --> 18:40.996
I didn't hear any splashes,

18:40.997 --> 18:44.296
so no one's thrown anyone
in the fountain yet.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.263
It smells.

18:46.264 --> 18:48.563
Yeah, this blows.

18:48.564 --> 18:51.129
I don't like this.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.929
Today, my pissed-ivity level
is extremely high and, um,

18:54.930 --> 18:56.729
I don't have any patience.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.029
We are the queens
of punishment, man.

18:59.030 --> 19:00.763
I think Elise doesn't realize

19:00.764 --> 19:02.429
how bad her attitude is.

19:02.430 --> 19:05.063
I mean, she didn't help
us win that challenge.

19:05.064 --> 19:06.997
So get the [Bleep] over it!

19:11.064 --> 19:12.630
(Man) How do you like
your scalp massage?

19:12.631 --> 19:14.263
Oh, it's amazing.

19:14.264 --> 19:15.563
[Laughter]

19:15.564 --> 19:16.664
This is awesome.

19:16.665 --> 19:17.996
So if anybody would like

19:17.997 --> 19:19.563
to get any waxing done today,

19:19.564 --> 19:21.330
we do have a waxing
station available.

19:21.331 --> 19:23.396
I'll get my face waxed.

19:23.397 --> 19:24.863
Who's going with me?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.363
Don't come at me with no wax.

19:26.364 --> 19:28.063
You know what I mean? I'm a man.

19:28.064 --> 19:29.397
I don't need that [Bleep].
I'll use a razor.

19:29.398 --> 19:30.863
Yo, I'll get a brow wax.

19:30.864 --> 19:32.763
I'll man up. Why the hell not?

19:32.764 --> 19:34.595
You know what I'm saying?
I mean, my wife does it.

19:34.596 --> 19:35.997
I mean, how hard can it be?

19:35.998 --> 19:37.063
[Grunts]

19:37.064 --> 19:38.696
You son of a [Bleep].

19:38.697 --> 19:40.396
[Laughter]

19:40.397 --> 19:42.163
(Tommy) I'm about to bail.

19:42.164 --> 19:43.796
Can I tap out? One, two, three.

19:43.797 --> 19:44.929
[Groans]

19:44.930 --> 19:46.629
Is it that bad?

19:46.630 --> 19:48.697
I feel like I got slapped
in the face by a large bug.

19:48.698 --> 19:50.096
[Laughter]

19:50.097 --> 19:51.696
I think we'll definitely be ready

19:51.697 --> 19:53.663
for some dinner service tonight.

19:53.664 --> 19:55.829
(Announcer) While the blue
team's day at the spa

19:55.830 --> 19:58.829
is winding down, the
Red Team is gearing up

19:58.830 --> 20:01.096
for dinner service by
prepping both kitchens.

20:01.097 --> 20:02.630
I can't believe we're,
like, going right into

20:02.631 --> 20:04.029
dinner service here.

20:04.030 --> 20:05.064
I know, right?
I'm kind of freaking out myself.

20:05.065 --> 20:06.396
Oh, boy!

20:06.397 --> 20:08.629
What a day at the spa!

20:08.630 --> 20:11.429
Tonight, going into service,
I'm ready to rock.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.463
With my eyebrows?
I mean, look at them.

20:13.464 --> 20:14.695
I mean, it just don't get
any better than that.

20:14.696 --> 20:16.097
How's our kitchen look, girls?

20:16.098 --> 20:17.496
Whoo!

20:17.497 --> 20:20.163
I definitely think our
morale is down right now.

20:20.164 --> 20:22.095
But the Red Team's
gotta win tonight.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.597
We have to prove that
we're meant to be here.

20:23.598 --> 20:26.696
We can do this.

20:26.697 --> 20:28.763
Let's go, guys. Let's go, blue.

20:28.764 --> 20:30.697
(Announcer) With Hell's Kitchen
just minutes from opening,

20:30.698 --> 20:32.363
it appears as though both teams

20:32.364 --> 20:33.697
are feeling confident for service.

20:33.698 --> 20:35.296
- We got this, ladies!
- Okay, James?

20:35.297 --> 20:36.830
- Yes, chef?
- Open Hell's Kitchen, please.

20:38.000 --> 20:44.074

20:48.964 --> 20:50.229
Dinner!

20:50.230 --> 20:52.229
(Announcer) For tonight's
dinner service,

20:52.230 --> 20:53.397
chef Ramsay has added
a tableside special

20:53.398 --> 20:55.963
to the menu: Halibut sashimi.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.530
Jennifer will look after
it for the Red Team...

20:57.531 --> 20:59.129
That's 40.

20:59.130 --> 21:00.762
(Announcer) And it will be
Natalie's responsibility

21:00.763 --> 21:01.797
for the Blue Team.

21:01.798 --> 21:03.329
Thank you. Here we go.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.895
Sashimi.
Wow, straight off the order.

21:04.896 --> 21:06.764
Two couples, table ten,
one sashimi, one Risotto.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.496
(All) Yes, chef.

21:08.497 --> 21:10.162
On order, 2 couples, table
16, 1 sashimi, 1 scallop.

21:10.163 --> 21:11.028
(All) Yes, chef.

21:11.029 --> 21:12.062
Let's go, Blue Team.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.064
Communicate, yes?

21:13.065 --> 21:14.463
(All) Yes, chef.

21:14.464 --> 21:15.828
Don't go too quick on the scallops.

21:15.829 --> 21:16.530
We have to put the
Risotto out first.

21:16.531 --> 21:17.796
All right.

21:17.797 --> 21:19.863
We'll talk to Natalie to
make sure it goes out.

21:19.864 --> 21:21.395
All right, Natalie, once
you slice the first one,

21:21.396 --> 21:23.030
give us the two-minute
warning and then we'll put

21:23.031 --> 21:24.496
- the scallops up.
- Okay.

21:24.497 --> 21:25.628
Three minutes, so that means
you drop in, like, 30 seconds.

21:25.629 --> 21:26.464
All right.

21:26.465 --> 21:28.129
Who got the Halibut sashimi?

21:28.130 --> 21:29.996
- I did.
- You are in for a treat.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.063
(Announcer) With Paul
organizing the Blue Team,

21:32.064 --> 21:34.096
they're off to a good
start on appetizers.

21:34.097 --> 21:36.896
Meanwhile in the red
kitchen, Krupa is eager

21:36.897 --> 21:38.795
to get back in chef
Ramsay's good graces.

21:38.796 --> 21:40.562
Jennifer, can you get that sashimi?

21:40.563 --> 21:42.430
I'm about three minutes
on that Risotto.

21:42.431 --> 21:45.996
Already. It doesn't take that long.

21:45.997 --> 21:49.063
After the disastrous
challenge that I screwed up,

21:49.064 --> 21:51.529
I'm gonna need a major
comeback in order for me

21:51.530 --> 21:53.929
to redeem myself in
chef Ramsay's eyes.

21:53.930 --> 21:55.796
Walking with the Risotto.

21:55.797 --> 21:57.628
'Cause I think he's
always gonna view me

21:57.629 --> 21:59.164
as the girl who can't
tell the difference

21:59.165 --> 22:00.863
between filet mignon and veal.

22:00.864 --> 22:02.729
(Gordon) Who made this?

22:02.730 --> 22:04.896
Who made that Risotto?

22:04.897 --> 22:07.964
Krupa!

22:15.868 --> 22:18.002
(Announcer) It's only 20
minutes into dinner service...

22:18.003 --> 22:20.134
(Gordon) Who made this?
Krupa!

22:20.135 --> 22:22.302
(Announcer) And after her poor
performance in the challenge,

22:22.303 --> 22:25.634
Krupa is facing her first test
on the appetizer station.

22:25.635 --> 22:28.601
The Risotto's like soup.
Krupa!

22:28.602 --> 22:31.334
The Risotto is like soup.

22:31.335 --> 22:32.468
Soup! Soup! Soup!

22:32.469 --> 22:35.001
[Bleep] Soup!

22:35.002 --> 22:36.234
Soupy Risotto?

22:36.235 --> 22:37.333
What the [Bleep] is wrong with me?

22:37.334 --> 22:38.600
Come on, Krupa!

22:38.601 --> 22:40.366
I know you don't know
the difference between

22:40.367 --> 22:41.766
veal and beef, but you must know

22:41.767 --> 22:42.635
the difference between
soup and Risotto.

22:42.636 --> 22:44.067
Yes, chef.

22:44.068 --> 22:45.434
This sucks.

22:45.435 --> 22:46.668
I am better than this.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.834
Risotto.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.101
(Gordon) Krupa! Cooked perfectly!

22:51.102 --> 22:52.801
Okay, let's go. Service.

22:52.802 --> 22:55.134
One [Bleep] up Risotto.
After that, no more.

22:55.135 --> 22:58.601
(Announcer) Krupa seems to be
back in the groove on appetizers.

22:58.602 --> 23:00.267
Yeah, perfect. Keep it going.

23:00.268 --> 23:01.068
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
in the dining room...

23:01.069 --> 23:02.534
Hello.

23:02.535 --> 23:04.600
(Announcer) Jennifer is
sweating it out tableside.

23:04.601 --> 23:05.768
This is grapefruit.

23:05.769 --> 23:07.634
(Announcer) Literally.

23:07.635 --> 23:10.467
I was stressed out
because I was sweating

23:10.468 --> 23:12.334
and I couldn't feel my nerves.

23:12.335 --> 23:15.834
Top it off with some
fresh orange zest.

23:15.835 --> 23:18.167
My God. Am I sweating?

23:18.168 --> 23:20.201
Jennifer, I know
it's hot out there.

23:20.202 --> 23:21.701
I know. I'm sweating like crazy.

23:21.702 --> 23:23.000
Yeah, no, no, but look at me.

23:23.001 --> 23:24.366
Napkin and wipe your face.
Okay, chef.

23:24.367 --> 23:25.468
Okay? Not in front of
the [Bleep] customers.

23:25.469 --> 23:28.367
Aye-yi-yi.

23:28.368 --> 23:31.034
(Announcer) 45 minutes
into dinner service,

23:31.035 --> 23:33.134
the Blue Team is off
to a fast start

23:33.135 --> 23:35.134
and have completed
their appetizers...

23:35.135 --> 23:36.801
Let's go, guys.

23:36.802 --> 23:38.435
One tray, one poached lobster,
one lamb, one sea bass.

23:38.436 --> 23:39.767
Yes, chef.

23:39.768 --> 23:41.867
(Announcer) And are
relying on Monterray,

23:41.868 --> 23:44.135
Tommy, and Jonathon to keep the
momentum going on entrees.

23:47.135 --> 23:48.600
- Real chopped-up mushrooms.
- Right, yeah.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.700
I got those right here.

23:49.701 --> 23:51.535
I had a little problem
with the menu

23:51.536 --> 23:53.434
remembering what goes with what.

23:53.435 --> 23:55.167
These go with the lamb.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.767
No, those don't go with the lamb.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.601
That's the... that's the bass.

23:58.602 --> 24:00.233
- Lamb. That's the bass.
- That's right.

24:00.234 --> 24:01.568
(Paul) Jonathon has a bad memory.

24:01.569 --> 24:03.201
You should know the menu by now.

24:03.202 --> 24:04.901
This is gonna go into this.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.334
[Bleep].

24:06.335 --> 24:08.066
That's the lobster.
That's your dish, right?

24:08.067 --> 24:09.500
That's the lobster. Right, okay?

24:09.501 --> 24:10.502
Jonathon, why has Paul
taken over the garnish?

24:10.503 --> 24:12.167
Yes, sir?

24:12.168 --> 24:13.535
Uh, he's helping me out, chef.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.033
Helping you out or doing it?

24:15.034 --> 24:16.335
I'm having a little bit of trouble.

24:16.336 --> 24:17.501
Oh, come on.

24:17.502 --> 24:18.700
Paul... yes, chef?

24:18.701 --> 24:20.133
- Come here, you.
- Yes, chef.

24:20.134 --> 24:21.466
Help him out...
there's a big difference.

24:21.467 --> 24:23.133
But actually taking
over I'm not gonna let.

24:23.134 --> 24:25.100
- Yes, chef. Yes, chef!
- Do you understand?

24:25.101 --> 24:26.666
Will the garnish be
ready, Jonathon?

24:26.667 --> 24:28.033
- Yes, chef, it'll be ready.
- Look at me.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.268
'Cause if it's not,
you can [Bleep] off.

24:29.269 --> 24:31.434
I'll have it ready, chef.

24:31.435 --> 24:33.734
(Announcer) While Jonathon
attempts to hold down

24:33.735 --> 24:35.966
the garnish station on his
own, back on the red side...

24:35.967 --> 24:37.666
(Gordon) One scallops,
one lobster spaghetti.

24:37.667 --> 24:38.600
- Yes, chef.
- Let's go.

24:38.601 --> 24:40.402
(Announcer) It's up
to Krupa and Gina

24:40.403 --> 24:43.034
to work together and get out
the next table of appetizers.

24:43.035 --> 24:45.334
How long, Gina?

24:45.335 --> 24:46.701
Talk to your team.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.301
I'm read... I'm ready.

24:48.302 --> 24:49.801
Can you slow it down?

24:49.802 --> 24:51.202
I need about a minute
and a half on my pasta.

24:51.203 --> 24:52.801
(Gina) I'm good to go.

24:52.802 --> 24:54.401
(Krupa) Slow it down a little bit.

24:54.402 --> 24:55.800
Gina seems to be in a rush

24:55.801 --> 24:58.266
to try to get things done,
but the pasta wasn't ready.

24:58.267 --> 25:00.000
So I kept on pushing it
back and pushing it back.

25:00.001 --> 25:01.368
I'm walking with the scallops.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.201
Oh, are you? Everybody else ready?

25:03.202 --> 25:04.734
Hold on. Hold 15 seconds.

25:04.735 --> 25:06.434
Walking with my scallops.

25:06.435 --> 25:08.134
Oh, [Bleep] Me.

25:08.135 --> 25:10.701
(Krupa) It's frustrating that
she's not listening to me.

25:10.702 --> 25:13.167
She was focused on the
task that she was doing,

25:13.168 --> 25:15.634
but there was no communication.

25:15.635 --> 25:16.460
Let's go, spaghetti.

25:16.461 --> 25:18.234
Lobster spaghetti
coming right now, chef.

25:18.235 --> 25:20.467
You're not even working
as a team yet.

25:20.468 --> 25:21.735
Hurry up, Krupa.

25:21.736 --> 25:25.034
Chef, lobster spaghetti.

25:25.035 --> 25:26.367
Undercooked.

25:26.368 --> 25:27.734
[Bleep] Me.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.001
Krupa!

25:30.002 --> 25:32.134
Taste that. Hurry up!

25:32.135 --> 25:34.101
Raw!

25:34.102 --> 25:35.867
I'll give you another one, chef.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.633
Gina definitely screwed
me over time-wise.

25:37.634 --> 25:39.400
And I had no choice but
to take it up like that

25:39.401 --> 25:40.368
and then take the blame for it.

25:40.369 --> 25:42.334
Gina, Krupa...

25:42.335 --> 25:45.134
All I'm begging for
is communication.

25:45.135 --> 25:47.001
Get it together.

25:47.002 --> 25:49.134
We'll start the table again.

25:49.135 --> 25:51.734
(Announcer) While Gina and
Krupa refire their appetizers,

25:51.735 --> 25:54.501
the Blue Team has managed to
start sending out entrees.

25:54.502 --> 25:56.667
On order, one poached
lobster, one Wellington.

25:56.668 --> 25:58.334
(All) Yes, chef.

25:58.335 --> 25:59.568
(Announcer) And now all
eyes are on Monterray

25:59.569 --> 26:01.034
on the meat station.

26:01.035 --> 26:02.835
- How long, Monterray?
- Three minutes, chef.

26:02.836 --> 26:04.434
Three minutes.

26:04.435 --> 26:06.002
I was totally comfortable
working the meat station,

26:06.003 --> 26:07.334
'cause I know it.

26:07.335 --> 26:08.566
I had a nice little rhythm with me.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.400
Everything was perfect.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.602
I felt pretty good.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.534
Oh, [Bleep] Me. Monterray!

26:12.535 --> 26:14.234
Yes, chef.

26:14.235 --> 26:15.868
When the white fat
marbling of a Wellington

26:15.869 --> 26:18.501
is not even [Bleep] melted,

26:18.502 --> 26:20.734
that is raw! Raw!

26:20.735 --> 26:22.235
- Have you got another one?
- I'll fire again, chef.

26:22.236 --> 26:23.934
Hurry up!

26:23.935 --> 26:26.367
Monterray, put up the food
right the first time.

26:26.368 --> 26:28.235
I mean, it's like we
all know chef Ramsay's

26:28.236 --> 26:30.034
not gonna take a rare cut of meat.

26:30.035 --> 26:31.866
I don't understand at
this stage in the game!

26:31.867 --> 26:32.336
Yes, chef.

26:32.337 --> 26:33.835
Well, take that first slice off

26:33.836 --> 26:35.333
and if it needs more cooking,

26:35.334 --> 26:36.802
don't continue [Bleep] slicing it!

26:36.803 --> 26:37.674
Yes, chef.

26:37.675 --> 26:39.067
Put it back in!

26:39.068 --> 26:40.235
Don't send it to me [Bleep] raw!

26:40.236 --> 26:41.734
Yes, chef.

26:41.735 --> 26:44.367
(Announcer) While Monterray
restarts his Wellington,

26:44.368 --> 26:47.301
over in the red kitchen,
Krupa is finally ready

26:47.302 --> 26:50.401
with her second...
lobster spaghetti.

26:50.402 --> 26:52.467
Oh, my God.

26:52.468 --> 26:54.334
So pissed off.

26:54.335 --> 26:56.867
I can't take it anymore.

26:56.868 --> 26:58.534
All of you, come here!

26:58.535 --> 27:00.334
Am I [Bleep] tired!

27:00.335 --> 27:01.566
What's wrong with that?

27:01.567 --> 27:02.668
It looks like [Bleep].

27:02.669 --> 27:04.101
There's no pasta.

27:04.102 --> 27:05.968
It looks like baby food
out of a [Bleep] tin.

27:05.969 --> 27:07.534
It's disgusting!

27:07.535 --> 27:09.201
Right, chef.

27:09.202 --> 27:11.002
(Gordon) From a soupy Risotto
to [Bleep] spaghetti

27:11.003 --> 27:12.467
drowned in sauce.

27:12.468 --> 27:16.001
Right now, appetizers is
sinking the whole ship.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.301
Hey, you. You.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.034
[Bleep] Off upstairs! Get out!

27:19.035 --> 27:23.267
I can't bear to look
at you anymore.

27:23.268 --> 27:24.668
Get out!

27:29.464 --> 27:31.563
(Announcer) It's an hour
into dinner service,

27:31.564 --> 27:33.063
and with Krupa making mistake...

27:33.064 --> 27:35.496
Soup! Soup! Soup!
A [Bleep] soup!

27:35.497 --> 27:37.596
(Announcer) After mistake... raw!

27:37.597 --> 27:39.196
(Announcer) After mistake...

27:39.197 --> 27:41.263
There's no pasta.
It's disgusting!

27:41.264 --> 27:42.763
Right, chef.

27:42.764 --> 27:44.662
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay
has seen enough.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.064
(Gordon) I can't
bear to look at you!

27:46.065 --> 27:48.063
Get out!

27:48.064 --> 27:49.463
[Sighs]

27:49.464 --> 27:51.729
I do know I'm better than this.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.597
You're the only one who
can dig your own grave

27:53.598 --> 27:57.363
and I dug myself
pretty deep at this point.

27:57.364 --> 27:59.563
(Announcer) With Krupa
banished to the dorm...

27:59.564 --> 28:01.130
I am going to the window
with the scallops.

28:01.131 --> 28:03.096
Caesar here. Service.

28:03.097 --> 28:05.629
(Announcer) The Red Team has
somehow pulled it together

28:05.630 --> 28:08.030
and is now getting appetizers
out to their hungry customers.

28:08.031 --> 28:09.429
It's excellent.

28:09.430 --> 28:11.097
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen,

28:11.098 --> 28:13.296
chef Ramsay is looking
to Monterray on meat

28:13.297 --> 28:16.796
and Tommy on fish to get
entrees out of the kitchen.

28:16.797 --> 28:18.230
Two cod, one lobster,
one Wellington.

28:18.231 --> 28:19.963
(All) Yes, chef.

28:19.964 --> 28:22.063
3 1/2 minutes, yes?
On the two cod?

28:22.064 --> 28:23.997
The Wellington?

28:26.164 --> 28:27.863
Tommy.

28:27.864 --> 28:29.964
(Paul) Tommy, how long on the cods?
You're driving!

28:29.965 --> 28:31.296
Tommy!

28:31.297 --> 28:32.963
Tommy doesn't talk.

28:32.964 --> 28:34.963
He shuts down. He gets real quiet.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.164
And then he doesn't talk
to chef and that's a sign

28:37.165 --> 28:39.763
of disrespect to chef, so
chef gets even madder at him.

28:39.764 --> 28:40.830
Tommy, how long?

28:40.831 --> 28:42.563
Tommy...

28:42.564 --> 28:44.495
You're keeping us all
[Bleep] waiting now.

28:44.496 --> 28:45.828
It's coming, chef.
It's coming, I promise.

28:45.829 --> 28:47.297
Yeah, but give me a [Bleep] time.

28:47.298 --> 28:49.163
Two minutes, yes?

28:49.164 --> 28:50.330
(Tommy) No, give me five.

28:50.331 --> 28:52.429
Oh, [Bleep] Hell.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.795
(Tommy) Got to redo that cod.

28:53.796 --> 28:55.064
Can't put that out, right?

28:55.065 --> 28:56.496
[Bleep], man.

28:56.497 --> 28:58.796
Yeah, push it back.
Five on that cod, guys.

28:58.797 --> 29:00.929
Five on that two cod.

29:00.930 --> 29:03.262
I'm being a leader for myself
in Hell's Kitchen right now.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.564
I'm making sure things
leaving my hands are perfect

29:05.565 --> 29:07.829
and that's how I'll be noticed.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.963
Monterray, hey, Bozo!

29:09.964 --> 29:11.464
How can you keep on
reheating your meat

29:11.465 --> 29:12.829
before it's overcooked?

29:12.830 --> 29:14.764
- It's not, chef.
- I don't know how the [Bleep] you do it.

29:14.765 --> 29:16.429
It won't be, chef. It won't be.

29:16.430 --> 29:18.430
(Announcer) Monterray and Tommy's
struggles with their entrees

29:18.431 --> 29:20.563
have left many of the
blue diners frustrated.

29:20.564 --> 29:22.829
I've had, what, three
pieces of that bread?

29:22.830 --> 29:24.729
It's just ridiculous.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.997
(Announcer) Meanwhile, the red
team have picked up the pace

29:26.998 --> 29:29.496
and have moved on to entrees.

29:29.497 --> 29:31.130
Two lobster, one
Wellington, one cod.

29:31.131 --> 29:32.896
How long, Gina?

29:32.897 --> 29:35.029
Hey, hello?

29:35.030 --> 29:36.195
Talk to garnish.

29:36.196 --> 29:37.497
You're driving the ticket.

29:37.498 --> 29:38.796
Yes, chef.

29:38.797 --> 29:40.663
Guys, I'm plating my cod.

29:40.664 --> 29:43.029
(Elise) I need a
minute on that cod.

29:43.030 --> 29:44.363
How long, Gina?

29:44.364 --> 29:45.929
I'm walking. Yes, chef.

29:45.930 --> 29:47.862
I'm walking with it.
You're walking.

29:47.863 --> 29:49.564
What?
You're not walk... okay, whatever.

29:49.565 --> 29:51.096
(Gordon) Whatever? Oh, my God.

29:51.097 --> 29:52.364
I don't have everything.

29:52.365 --> 29:54.196
You don't have what?

29:54.197 --> 29:57.496
Why doesn't anyone understand?
Talk!

29:57.497 --> 29:59.196
Gina wasn't communicating with me,

29:59.197 --> 30:01.196
and I don't know if she was trying

30:01.197 --> 30:03.464
to throw me under the bus,
but that really screwed me.

30:03.465 --> 30:05.496
(Gordon) Go with it, Gina.

30:05.497 --> 30:07.528
She's reheating vegetables.
You're cooking fish to order.

30:07.529 --> 30:08.597
Yes, chef! Scream at her!

30:08.598 --> 30:09.597
Yes, chef!

30:09.598 --> 30:11.163
Talk to each other!

30:11.164 --> 30:12.696
Yes, chef.

30:12.697 --> 30:14.464
(Announcer) Gina's poor
communication once again

30:14.465 --> 30:16.463
has stalled the Red Team.

30:16.464 --> 30:18.629
But over in the blue
kitchen, Tommy is ready

30:18.630 --> 30:20.696
to deliver his refired cod.

30:20.697 --> 30:22.730
Cod, sea bass, Wellington strip.
I hope it's working!

30:22.731 --> 30:24.363
(Tommy) These are up for the cod.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.863
- Let's plate this.
- Wellington?

30:25.864 --> 30:29.864
Ah! [Bleep], [Bleep]!

30:30.430 --> 30:32.497
Will, take a look at this.
I don't think it's gon' pass.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.063
If you don't think that's right,

30:34.064 --> 30:35.162
you need to let them know now.

30:35.163 --> 30:36.397
Guys, I don't think it's right.
Pull back.

30:36.398 --> 30:37.529
Oh, come on.

30:37.530 --> 30:40.829
Oh, [Bleep]. [Bleep].

30:40.830 --> 30:41.830
Come here, you.

30:41.831 --> 30:43.296
That's me.

30:43.297 --> 30:45.096
I said to you four minutes ago,

30:45.097 --> 30:47.229
"how can you continue
cooking a Wellington?"

30:47.230 --> 30:48.596
I had two, chef.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.395
One was over and I still
had one to settle

30:50.396 --> 30:51.397
with the other check,
and the other one

30:51.398 --> 30:52.729
was overcooked as well.

30:52.730 --> 30:53.997
So they're both overcooked?

30:53.998 --> 30:55.463
You!

30:55.464 --> 30:57.996
- Come here, you.
- Yes, chef.

30:57.997 --> 30:59.328
Last table was the cod overcooked.

30:59.329 --> 31:00.564
Now it's the Wellington.

31:00.565 --> 31:02.363
Let me communicate to both of you.

31:02.364 --> 31:03.696
[Bleep] Off out of here.

31:03.697 --> 31:04.730
Get out of here, both of you.

31:04.731 --> 31:05.929
Piss off!

31:05.930 --> 31:07.397
Get upstairs and [Bleep] sit

31:07.398 --> 31:10.063
and high-five each other.

31:10.064 --> 31:12.229
Get out, Tommy!

31:12.230 --> 31:13.929
[Bleep].

31:13.930 --> 31:15.630
Everything was ready to
go and tom kept pushing

31:15.631 --> 31:17.696
the time back.

31:17.697 --> 31:19.464
It's like I only push it
back, but so many times,

31:19.465 --> 31:20.796
so I was pissed.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.464
I had it twice.
I had it twice, dude.

31:22.465 --> 31:24.563
I had everything clockwork
perfect all night.

31:24.564 --> 31:26.129
I had it twice.

31:26.130 --> 31:28.230
I did not deserve to get thrown
out the kitchen tonight.

31:28.231 --> 31:31.063
You kept pushing the time
back on the Wellingtons.

31:31.064 --> 31:32.464
I did not hand the chef
anything that was bad.

31:32.465 --> 31:34.296
You killed me.

31:34.297 --> 31:36.229
I don't know what happened.

31:36.230 --> 31:38.364
It's almost like I got called
in to someone else's mistakes.

31:38.365 --> 31:39.796
That's not fair at all.

31:39.797 --> 31:41.829
There's no way I deserved that one.

31:41.830 --> 31:45.296
(Announcer) It's nearly two
hours into dinner service,

31:45.297 --> 31:47.629
and chef Ramsay is hoping
that Gina and Elise

31:47.630 --> 31:49.564
have put their communication
problems behind them

31:49.565 --> 31:51.996
and are ready to deliver entrees.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.296
Garnish, polenta fries.

31:54.297 --> 31:55.529
Yes, chef.

31:55.530 --> 31:57.663
- Really?
- Yes, chef.

31:57.664 --> 31:59.663
I can walk with my entrees now.
Are you ready?

31:59.664 --> 32:01.763
I need a minute out
when you're walking.

32:01.764 --> 32:03.495
- I can't just walk up there.
- I did call, Elise.

32:03.496 --> 32:04.897
Well, then make sure I heard you.

32:04.898 --> 32:07.596
It's like two cats fighting.

32:07.597 --> 32:09.863
The communication thing
just went out the window

32:09.864 --> 32:11.163
and they're both guilty.

32:11.164 --> 32:13.463
Garnish, mash, carrots.

32:13.464 --> 32:16.063
- Where's the bass?
- Plating now, chef!

32:16.064 --> 32:17.396
Are you sure? Yeah.

32:17.397 --> 32:19.696
Yeah, that's cooked, okay.

32:19.697 --> 32:21.497
Here we go. It's hot, chef.
Very hot.

32:21.498 --> 32:23.396
Oh, stop. [Bleep] Off, will you?

32:23.397 --> 32:25.864
Ahh.

32:27.764 --> 32:31.229
All of you come here!

32:31.230 --> 32:32.563
Raw bass!

32:32.564 --> 32:35.296
Raw [Bleep] bass!

32:35.297 --> 32:37.329
Oh, my God.
Like, here it comes.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.729
Nothing at all?
Anything to say? Anybody?

32:39.730 --> 32:42.164
[Bleep] Off.

32:49.481 --> 32:51.379
(Announcer) It's two hours
into dinner service,

32:51.380 --> 32:52.748
and Gina's undercooked fish...

32:52.749 --> 32:53.914
Raw bass!

32:53.915 --> 32:55.814
Raw [Bleep] bass!

32:55.815 --> 32:58.414
(Announcer) Has chef Ramsay
looking for answers.

32:58.415 --> 32:59.548
Anything to say now?

32:59.549 --> 33:00.714
No, chef.

33:00.715 --> 33:02.081
Nothing at all? Anything to say?

33:02.082 --> 33:03.081
Anybody?

33:03.082 --> 33:04.347
[Bleep] Off.

33:04.348 --> 33:07.980
Both of you, [Bleep] Off upstairs.

33:07.981 --> 33:09.779
I feel like my
performance was subpar,

33:09.780 --> 33:11.379
but I don't feel that
it was bad enough

33:11.380 --> 33:13.215
for me to be thrown
out the kitchen.

33:13.216 --> 33:14.847
[Bleep], man.

33:14.848 --> 33:18.014
If my sea bass was okay, I
wouldn't have got sent out.

33:18.015 --> 33:19.881
Honestly, nobody was talking to me.

33:19.882 --> 33:22.080
And I kept having to ask,
"what's going?

33:22.081 --> 33:23.681
What are you going up with?
" And you were already walking

33:23.682 --> 33:25.547
and nobody had told me anything.

33:25.548 --> 33:27.246
Nobody was telling me nothing.
I know I was not...

33:27.247 --> 33:28.646
So y'all can try to
throw me under the bus

33:28.647 --> 33:29.748
if you want to.

33:29.749 --> 33:31.347
Wasn't nobody telling me [Bleep].

33:31.348 --> 33:32.379
- Why you getting an attitude?
- Not you.

33:32.380 --> 33:34.113
Not you. Not you.
You don't even know

33:34.114 --> 33:35.779
if anybody's gonna throw
you under the bus or not,

33:35.780 --> 33:37.013
and before that, you're
already catching an attitude.

33:37.014 --> 33:38.113
That's what I'm saying.
Just calm down.

33:38.114 --> 33:39.481
You don't know what's gonna happen.

33:39.482 --> 33:41.979
Shut your mouths for ten
[Bleep] seconds and listen.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.348
There's nothing
personal against you.

33:43.349 --> 33:44.648
It's just the attitude.

33:44.649 --> 33:47.547
I don't feel that I was the worst.

33:47.548 --> 33:49.779
(Announcer) While the debate
continues on the patio,

33:49.780 --> 33:51.681
back in the kitchen,
the remaining members

33:51.682 --> 33:54.614
of both teams hurry to
complete dinner service.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.579
Last ticket, ladies.
Keep it going.

33:56.580 --> 33:57.715
Ladies, keep it together.

33:57.716 --> 33:59.147
I'm slicing the welly.

33:59.148 --> 34:00.914
- Walking with my meat.
- Okay.

34:00.915 --> 34:02.748
Behind, chef.
Coming down, watch your back.

34:02.749 --> 34:06.414
Service, please.

34:06.415 --> 34:08.514
- Hurry up!
- Garnish, chef.

34:08.514 --> 34:10.313
Come on, girls.
We can finish this.

34:10.313 --> 34:11.148
(Gordon) Let's go.
Last table, guys.

34:11.149 --> 34:12.414
Hallelujah.

34:12.415 --> 34:15.547
Switch off.

34:18.547 --> 34:21.179
I've had enough.
I am so pissed off,

34:21.181 --> 34:23.914
'cause I can't see
a leader anywhere.

34:23.915 --> 34:26.880
No inspiration!
No communication!

34:26.880 --> 34:28.547
Zero!

34:28.547 --> 34:30.614
You're going backwards!

34:30.614 --> 34:32.280
Winning team?

34:32.281 --> 34:34.080
No such thing.

34:34.081 --> 34:36.045
Both the Blue Team
and the Red Team,

34:36.047 --> 34:37.981
get upstairs and come
up with two individuals

34:37.982 --> 34:42.246
from each team that could
really make your team stronger

34:42.248 --> 34:44.114
by getting the hell out of here.

34:47.481 --> 34:49.215
[Bleep] Off.

34:52.848 --> 34:54.980
I think we're both
in danger tonight.

34:54.981 --> 34:56.612
I mean, Red Team, Blue Team
both had piss-poor services.

34:56.614 --> 34:58.415
He could send two people home.
He could send four people home.

34:58.416 --> 35:00.780
I don't know.

35:00.781 --> 35:02.547
(Will) All right, let's do this.

35:02.548 --> 35:03.946
Let's make this short and sweet.

35:03.947 --> 35:05.148
Who wants to go first?

35:05.149 --> 35:08.447
I'll have to go with, uh,
tomboy and monty, man.

35:08.448 --> 35:11.147
[Bleep] Monty needs to go, man.

35:11.148 --> 35:14.080
Either you can cook or
you can't, and he can't.

35:14.081 --> 35:15.715
You know, he can't
[Bleep] cook, man.

35:15.716 --> 35:17.347
I nominate monty.

35:17.348 --> 35:21.414
The second one, I nominate Tommy.

35:21.415 --> 35:22.813
He turned his back to chef

35:22.814 --> 35:24.048
and chef was yelling at him

35:24.049 --> 35:25.714
and he wasn't communicating.

35:25.715 --> 35:27.613
Yeah, I know.
I didn't do it on purpose.

35:27.614 --> 35:29.079
You know what I'm saying?
I didn't know.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.413
When you turn your back to
him and not say anything,

35:30.414 --> 35:31.579
that's literally going
like this to him.

35:31.580 --> 35:33.315
He just doesn't communicate
with the team.

35:33.316 --> 35:35.480
You need to be vocal.
You need to talk.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.915
When you shut down,

35:36.916 --> 35:39.481
the kitchen shuts down with you.

35:40.615 --> 35:43.614
We done here, guys, yeah?

35:43.615 --> 35:45.915
I'm going out swinging.

35:51.648 --> 35:54.114
Elizabeth, pick two.
Who would you pick?

35:54.115 --> 35:56.647
Krupa and Elise. Who?

35:56.648 --> 35:58.781
I really felt like it was a
disaster of a service for you.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.747
Was my performance subpar tonight?

36:00.748 --> 36:02.914
Yes, but I don't feel
that I was the weakest.

36:02.915 --> 36:04.748
- Who would you vote for?
- I would vote for Krupa and Gina.

36:08.581 --> 36:10.414
I mean, I [Bleep] up this morning

36:10.415 --> 36:12.614
really badly and I
[Bleep] up service.

36:12.615 --> 36:14.081
But appetizers did go out.

36:14.082 --> 36:15.614
Carrie, who do you say?

36:15.615 --> 36:17.814
I mean, I'm sure you're
gonna say me anyway,

36:17.815 --> 36:19.748
because you would love
to see me goner, so.

36:19.749 --> 36:21.880
Will you quit taking
it [Bleep] personally?

36:21.881 --> 36:23.081
'Cause it is.
It is what it is.

36:23.082 --> 36:24.814
Oh, my God.

36:24.815 --> 36:26.079
If I had to pick one person,

36:26.080 --> 36:27.281
I would say it was Gina.

36:27.282 --> 36:28.880
I just didn't hear you.

36:28.881 --> 36:30.547
I didn't hear you at all.

36:30.548 --> 36:31.815
You know, we're all guilty
of not communicating

36:31.816 --> 36:33.614
properly tonight.

36:33.615 --> 36:35.680
You know, we weren't communicating.

36:35.681 --> 36:37.379
I was asking, "tell me
when you're a minute out.

36:37.380 --> 36:38.646
Tell me when you're a minute
out," and you didn't.

36:38.647 --> 36:40.146
She already said that
didn't communicate.

36:40.147 --> 36:41.579
She took charge of
what she did wrong.

36:41.580 --> 36:43.613
I mean, I know you don't
like me and you would love

36:43.614 --> 36:44.913
to see me go up and I'm
not trying to argue.

36:44.914 --> 36:46.213
(Carrie) This isn't
personal, Elise.

36:46.214 --> 36:47.148
I'm defending myself and
I'm saying what happened

36:47.149 --> 36:48.447
on my station.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.346
They want to pretend
like it's about a team,

36:50.347 --> 36:51.513
but it's really not.

36:51.514 --> 36:52.946
It's everybody for themselves.

36:52.947 --> 36:54.715
Please let me just make
it to individuals,

36:54.716 --> 36:56.380
because that's where I need to be.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.713
That's where I'll shine the most,

36:57.714 --> 36:59.148
not trying to worry about
these other broads

36:59.149 --> 37:03.148
who don't give a damn about me.

37:03.481 --> 37:05.747
I will say this one thing.

37:05.748 --> 37:09.781
Feels good not to
be up there myself.

37:20.548 --> 37:23.214
Paul...

37:23.215 --> 37:25.647
First nominee and why, please.

37:25.648 --> 37:27.347
Monterray, chef.

37:27.348 --> 37:29.047
He's had lackluster performances

37:29.048 --> 37:30.313
in the last two services.

37:30.314 --> 37:31.715
So your second nominee is?

37:31.716 --> 37:33.247
Tommy.

37:33.248 --> 37:34.879
We feel that sometimes
when he gets weeded,

37:34.880 --> 37:36.248
his lack of communication

37:36.249 --> 37:39.080
is detrimental to the
rest of the team.

37:39.081 --> 37:41.147
Red Team, have you
come to a consensus?

37:41.148 --> 37:43.247
(All) Yes, chef.

37:43.248 --> 37:44.915
(Gordon) Carrie,
who's the Red Team's

37:44.916 --> 37:47.514
first nominee and why, please.

37:47.515 --> 37:50.714
(Carrie) First nominee is Krupa.

37:50.715 --> 37:54.780
The challenge with the proteins
and also this evening,

37:54.781 --> 37:57.114
appetizers, several came back.

37:57.115 --> 37:58.780
Okay, second one?

37:58.781 --> 38:02.781
Second nominee is...

38:12.290 --> 38:14.121
(Announcer) With no
dinner service winner,

38:14.122 --> 38:15.957
chef Ramsay
asked both teams to nominate

38:15.958 --> 38:18.089
two of their own for elimination.

38:18.090 --> 38:21.322
The Blue Team
chose Monterray and Tommy.

38:21.323 --> 38:22.989
And the Red Team chose...

38:22.990 --> 38:25.989
Krupa.

38:25.990 --> 38:27.556
So your second nominee is?

38:27.557 --> 38:31.557
Second nominee is...

38:32.457 --> 38:36.822
Elise.

38:36.823 --> 38:38.389
She failed to communicate

38:38.390 --> 38:40.256
and she held up entrees.

38:40.257 --> 38:43.356
Elise, Krupa,
Tommy, and Monterray,

38:43.357 --> 38:45.089
step forward, please.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.990
[Sighs]

38:54.257 --> 38:56.456
Elise...

38:56.457 --> 38:58.421
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:58.422 --> 38:59.355
I think I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen

38:59.356 --> 39:00.655
'cause I have a lot to give.

39:00.656 --> 39:02.455
And I know that I'm not
the weakest on my team,

39:02.456 --> 39:04.157
but I can guarantee you,
chef, that if you grant me

39:04.158 --> 39:05.457
a second chance,

39:05.458 --> 39:06.957
I won't be up here a third time.

39:06.958 --> 39:11.022
So if you're not the
weakest, who is?

39:11.023 --> 39:12.290
Gina is the weakest.

39:12.291 --> 39:14.856
Krupa...

39:14.857 --> 39:17.289
Tell me why you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen.

39:17.290 --> 39:19.289
Help me. My last 24 hours...

39:19.290 --> 39:21.022
Have been my lowest.

39:21.023 --> 39:23.156
Are you the weakest
chef in the Red Team?

39:23.157 --> 39:24.821
I would have to say Elise
just because of the attitude.

39:24.822 --> 39:26.623
Wasn't looking for the
weakest attitude.

39:26.624 --> 39:30.189
The weakest cook.

39:30.190 --> 39:31.956
I would have to say Gina as well.

39:31.957 --> 39:34.056
(Gordon) Tommy...

39:34.057 --> 39:35.722
You seem to melt down

39:35.723 --> 39:37.689
into a little zone.

39:37.690 --> 39:39.190
I could have been more
vocal with my team.

39:39.191 --> 39:40.756
It was my flaw.

39:40.757 --> 39:42.455
But I sure as [Bleep]
didn't step down

39:42.456 --> 39:43.290
and step back from my station.

39:43.291 --> 39:44.422
You cut me off

39:44.423 --> 39:45.922
and then you cut your team off.

39:45.923 --> 39:47.323
Chef, it doesn't
mean I'm giving up.

39:47.324 --> 39:48.823
It means I made a mistake.

39:48.824 --> 39:51.156
Monterray...

39:51.157 --> 39:52.957
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.455
I'm definitely not done here.

39:54.456 --> 39:56.321
I'll push for you and I'll
push hard for my team.

39:56.322 --> 39:58.623
Are you the weakest chef in
your kitchen, Monterray?

39:58.624 --> 40:00.823
No I'm not, chef.
I think I'm a great cook.

40:03.257 --> 40:05.957
Okay, my decision is...

40:10.690 --> 40:14.489
Elise...

40:14.490 --> 40:15.856
I agree with you.

40:15.857 --> 40:18.889
Gina, take your jacket off.

40:18.890 --> 40:20.523
Your time in Hell's
Kitchen is done.

40:24.190 --> 40:25.756
You are disintegrating.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.889
There's no fight back.
There's no voice.

40:27.890 --> 40:29.221
Please give me your jacket

40:29.222 --> 40:30.323
and get out of Hell's Kitchen.

40:30.324 --> 40:31.389
Yes, chef.

40:31.390 --> 40:33.522
Thank you.

40:33.523 --> 40:34.623
Thank you for the opportunity.

40:34.624 --> 40:35.823
Good night.

40:43.623 --> 40:46.989
(Gina) I do think chef Ramsay
was wrong to let me go.

40:46.990 --> 40:48.989
He should have eliminated Elise.

40:48.990 --> 40:51.589
She's a big problem
on the Red Team.

40:51.590 --> 40:53.789
But I absolutely will
walk out of here

40:53.790 --> 40:55.256
with my head held high.

40:55.257 --> 40:59.256
I gave it everything that I had.

40:59.257 --> 41:02.056
Each and every one of you
listen and listen carefully.

41:02.057 --> 41:06.057
I have not given up on you.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.856
Yes, I'm pissed...

41:08.857 --> 41:11.189
Because I've seen
flashes of brilliance.

41:11.190 --> 41:13.289
Are you all

41:13.290 --> 41:14.457
ready to fight back?

41:14.458 --> 41:16.822
(All) Yes, chef!

41:16.823 --> 41:18.022
Then show me.

41:18.023 --> 41:19.189
Good night.

41:19.190 --> 41:21.356
(All) Good night, chef.

41:21.357 --> 41:23.556
I'm feeling like the
bullet's coming right at me

41:23.557 --> 41:25.056
and I managed to dodge it.

41:25.057 --> 41:26.856
But this is the last time.

41:26.857 --> 41:30.056
You will not see me up on that
chopping block ever again.

41:30.057 --> 41:32.989
Whoo, baby!
Another one bites the dust.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.423
That's a step closer for me
to get to that grand prize.

41:35.424 --> 41:37.389
That's BLT and that 250k.

41:37.390 --> 41:39.622
When somebody tries
to tear me down,

41:39.623 --> 41:42.122
that just gives me the strength
to push it to the next level.

41:42.123 --> 41:44.390
And I'm putting my game face
on and they better bring it,

41:44.391 --> 41:46.689
'cause I sure will be.

41:46.690 --> 41:48.990
(Gordon) They say good things
come in small packages.

41:48.991 --> 41:50.756
But unfortunately in Gina's case,

41:50.757 --> 41:54.057
her talent matched her size...
tiny.

41:58.890 --> 42:00.857
(Announcer) Next time
on Hell's Kitchen...

42:00.858 --> 42:03.456
We are gonna be hosting
a high school reunion.

42:03.457 --> 42:04.889
I loved high school.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.655
(Announcer) Carrie
and Elise's feud...

42:06.656 --> 42:08.555
Elise, could I please
talk for [Bleep] once?

42:08.556 --> 42:10.357
(Announcer) Could get
them thrown in detention.

42:10.358 --> 42:12.456
You better get out of my face.

42:12.457 --> 42:14.622
Should have been a model.

42:14.623 --> 42:16.157
(Announcer) But they're not the only
ones who are getting in trouble.

42:16.158 --> 42:17.156
Sexy.

42:17.157 --> 42:18.888
Why don't you take
the yellow thing off?

42:18.889 --> 42:20.590
(Announcer) But at the
reunion dinner...

42:20.591 --> 42:22.389
(Gordon) All of you!

42:22.390 --> 42:24.323
(Announcer) Which chefs
will flunk cooking 101?

42:24.324 --> 42:26.722
The fish is [Bleep] raw!

42:26.723 --> 42:29.722
(Announcer) And who will start
acting like snotty teenagers?

42:29.723 --> 42:31.256
Come on, today. I'm slicing them.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.089
Dump that pan and start over!

42:33.090 --> 42:35.289
Come on, man. [Bleep] Tonight!

42:35.290 --> 42:36.989
Where's your respect?

42:36.990 --> 42:38.657
(Announcer) This is one
trip down memory lane...

42:38.658 --> 42:40.822
It's the committee's table!

42:40.823 --> 42:42.588
(Announcer) That no one
will want to remember.

42:42.589 --> 42:44.023
I want my five-star meal.

42:44.024 --> 42:45.922
I am so pissed off.

42:45.923 --> 42:48.022
(Announcer) All next time
on a Hell's Kitchen...

42:48.023 --> 42:49.457
Like the Titanic, it's going down.

42:49.458 --> 42:50.590
Ah!
