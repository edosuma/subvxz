WEBVTT

00:02.643 --> 00:04.977
PETE: Well, I got some bad
news on my end, guys.

00:05.045 --> 00:07.414
My old Gumpa Duke is headed
into a retirement home.

00:07.481 --> 00:08.581
ANDRE: Aw!

00:08.649 --> 00:09.783
KEVIN: Oh, really?

00:09.850 --> 00:12.185
RUXIN: No! I like Gumpa Duke,
and I hate all old people.

00:12.252 --> 00:13.420
I know. It's just a bummer.

00:13.487 --> 00:15.789
He's got some mental faculty
issues, and Gumma Eve had no

00:15.856 --> 00:18.191
choice but to kind of put him in there.

00:18.258 --> 00:19.426
Everybody's getting old.

00:19.493 --> 00:20.593
Everybody.

00:20.661 --> 00:22.995
I mean, it's, like, staring
us in the face at this point.

00:23.063 --> 00:25.432
Why are you so down about getting old?

00:25.499 --> 00:26.800
Eating salad. What's going on?

00:26.867 --> 00:29.202
Well, I'm just... I'm trying to
eat healthier because I have

00:29.269 --> 00:30.437
a thing that I'm planning for.

00:30.504 --> 00:32.806
You going to the mall to get
your glamour shots done?

00:32.873 --> 00:36.443
No. I have to get a colonoscopy
for my life insurance.

00:36.510 --> 00:37.610
Oh, that's not a big deal.

00:37.678 --> 00:38.812
It's like getting an enema.

00:38.879 --> 00:40.012
They're easy.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.449
I'm not going to make fun of
him getting a colonoscopy,

00:42.516 --> 00:44.818
especially since the amateur
ones you've been giving him over

00:44.885 --> 00:46.018
the years have not been working.

00:46.086 --> 00:47.220
Oh.

00:47.287 --> 00:48.455
Look, here we are.

00:48.522 --> 00:49.622
Boo-oop!

00:49.690 --> 00:50.824
Does it ever get old, Ruxin?

00:50.891 --> 00:52.024
Pete-Kevin dick jokes?

00:52.092 --> 00:53.226
It does.

00:53.293 --> 00:54.461
Fine. I'll stop.

00:54.528 --> 00:55.628
I just need one last score.

00:55.696 --> 00:58.030
It's not a heist movie, Ruxin.

00:58.098 --> 01:00.032
You know, by the way, we should
also put a moratorium on

01:00.100 --> 01:01.234
the Andre-dresses-bad jokes.

01:01.301 --> 01:02.469
ALL: No!

01:02.536 --> 01:03.470
Absolutely not.

01:03.537 --> 01:05.805
Timeless.

01:05.873 --> 01:07.039
Hope I see you again.

01:07.107 --> 01:09.476
I'm in room 117.

01:09.543 --> 01:10.643
Gumpa Duke?

01:10.711 --> 01:14.213
Hi. Hi. It's... Gumpa Duke,
it's your grandson, Pete.

01:14.281 --> 01:15.415
Of course, I know.

01:15.483 --> 01:16.649
It's little Petey.

01:16.717 --> 01:17.851
How are you?

01:17.918 --> 01:19.051
Wait. You know who I am.

01:19.119 --> 01:20.253
Of course I do.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.655
What the hell's the matter with you?
Come on.

01:22.723 --> 01:23.857
I-I... I don't know.

01:23.924 --> 01:25.057
I heard some things.

01:25.125 --> 01:26.259
I don't know.

01:26.326 --> 01:27.494
So, what brings you out here?

01:27.561 --> 01:28.661
I hadn't seen you in a while.

01:28.729 --> 01:32.265
I think it's been... Is it
since Fourth of July, I think?

01:32.332 --> 01:33.500
Uncle Steve's barbecue.

01:33.567 --> 01:34.667
It was in August.

01:34.735 --> 01:35.869
Twenty-fifth of August, I think.

01:35.936 --> 01:37.069
Oh, yeah, you're right.

01:37.137 --> 01:38.271
Forgot about that.

01:38.338 --> 01:40.673
Still got that 2008 Crown Vic?

01:40.741 --> 01:43.075
I do. I... I, in fact, have that car.

01:43.143 --> 01:45.512
Maybe I'll get you a Triple
A card for your birthday.

01:45.579 --> 01:46.679
March 28, isn't it?

01:46.747 --> 01:50.950
Yes. My... Grandpa, I got to say, you...
You look great, you-you sound

01:51.018 --> 01:53.352
great, your memory's like a steel trap.

01:53.421 --> 01:55.722
I-I got to wonder what
you're doing in here.

01:55.790 --> 01:56.923
Wendy.

01:56.990 --> 01:58.124
Hello.

01:58.191 --> 01:59.358
Oh, how beautiful you are.

01:59.427 --> 02:00.560
Oh, thank you.

02:00.628 --> 02:01.728
Oh. (muttering)

02:01.796 --> 02:02.929
Oh, my goodness.

02:02.996 --> 02:04.130
Oh!

02:04.197 --> 02:05.364
Oh, dear.

02:05.433 --> 02:06.566
(Wendy laughs)

02:06.634 --> 02:07.734
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

02:07.802 --> 02:08.935
(Wendy clears throat)

02:09.002 --> 02:10.136
Oh!

02:10.203 --> 02:11.370
Gumpa Duke! Gumpa Duke!

02:11.439 --> 02:12.572
Gumpa Duke, what are you...?

02:12.640 --> 02:14.941
What are you doing? This... You
know, this is not Gumma Eve.

02:15.008 --> 02:16.142
This is not my wife?

02:16.209 --> 02:17.611
Oh.

02:21.292 --> 02:23.627
The hand kind of fell to the
butt, and I was, like, "Oh,

02:23.694 --> 02:26.029
maybe it was a mistake," and
then it moved over to the other

02:26.096 --> 02:28.532
butt cheek, and then he just
scooped it and got under there.

02:28.599 --> 02:29.699
Really?

02:29.767 --> 02:32.101
I mean, he was getting frisky
with some random older woman.

02:32.169 --> 02:33.303
Guys, it's sad.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.705
This guy is losing his faculties.

02:35.773 --> 02:38.141
Well, it is sad if it's Alzheimer's.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.375
But what do you mean?

02:39.444 --> 02:42.946
Well, I'm saying, there's a little bit
of selective memory going on here, okay?

02:43.013 --> 02:45.982
He quoted my high school
pole vault record to me.

02:46.050 --> 02:48.418
So it could be Alzheimer's or adultery.

02:48.486 --> 02:50.787
Look, all I'm saying is, I'm
beginning to suspect that the

02:50.855 --> 02:53.222
only thing he's forgotten
is that he's married.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.625
I just hate thinking about old
people having sex, just like

02:55.693 --> 02:57.994
a dried-up potato stuffing
its way into a crusty sock.

02:58.062 --> 02:59.228
Oh.

02:59.296 --> 03:01.631
TACO: Old people sex is quite beautiful.

03:01.699 --> 03:04.000
They know what they like, and no
awkward abortion conversation.

03:04.068 --> 03:06.436
Getting old is just the worst!

03:06.504 --> 03:08.805
Now I have this colonoscopy appointment.

03:08.873 --> 03:11.240
You know, they tell you, you
have to have someone drive you

03:11.308 --> 03:13.643
home because you're going
to be heavily sedated?

03:13.711 --> 03:15.946
That's why I am your
colonoscopy co-pilot.

03:16.013 --> 03:17.180
That's right.

03:17.247 --> 03:19.616
Just because they're going
downtown on you doesn't mean

03:19.684 --> 03:20.784
that we can't go downtown, too.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.186
Plan the perfect day for the two of us.

03:23.253 --> 03:24.420
No. No, no, no.

03:24.489 --> 03:25.622
There's no perfect day.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.991
Pick you up, we'll go see a movie, okay?

03:28.058 --> 03:30.193
No. No, we're not going
to see a movie, Andre.

03:30.260 --> 03:31.427
Go see <i>Lincoln.</i>

03:31.496 --> 03:32.428
I want to see <i>Lincoln</i> again.

03:32.497 --> 03:34.430
You want me to have a
colonoscopy, and then go spend

03:34.499 --> 03:37.634
three and a half hours watching Daniel
Day-Lewis play Abraham Lincoln?

03:37.702 --> 03:38.802
Okay, you know what?

03:38.870 --> 03:41.004
We'll just get Indian food, like
I originally planned, and we

03:41.071 --> 03:42.205
won't go see the movie.

03:42.272 --> 03:43.439
What?

03:43.508 --> 03:44.440
I'm not doing that, either.

03:44.509 --> 03:47.644
All right, we'll just hang out in
my car, I'll play you some tunes.

03:47.712 --> 03:51.214
I've actually made him my own mix
tape, which is really... I'll walk.

03:51.281 --> 03:53.517
I'm gonna walk home.

03:53.584 --> 03:54.618
JENNY: Taco?

03:54.685 --> 03:55.785
(Taco sighs)

03:55.853 --> 03:56.987
What is all this stuff?

03:57.054 --> 04:00.624
Why do I come here for free food if
you're not gonna get the stuff I ask for?

04:00.691 --> 04:01.791
You know what, Taco?

04:01.859 --> 04:04.193
I don't have time to worry about this.

04:04.261 --> 04:06.396
I am late picking Ellie
up from gymnastics.

04:06.463 --> 04:07.397
Just grab something and go.

04:07.464 --> 04:08.632
Ooh! Fruit roll-up.

04:08.699 --> 04:10.967
No.

04:11.035 --> 04:13.403
Oh, you dirty girl.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.638
Edible underwear.

04:14.705 --> 04:17.007
They were a joke gift from a
bachelorette party, Taco.

04:17.074 --> 04:19.409
So you keep them in the pantry?

04:19.476 --> 04:20.644
I could have eaten these.

04:20.711 --> 04:23.013
Where am I supposed to put them?

04:23.080 --> 04:25.415
It's not like I have a sex drawer, Taco.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.651
Where do you put all your
dildos and your nipple clamps?

04:27.718 --> 04:28.818
Ugh. Just..

04:28.886 --> 04:30.820
Just give them to me.

04:30.888 --> 04:33.222
You don't think Kevin would
ever go for these, do you?

04:33.290 --> 04:35.592
He likes sex, and he likes food.

04:35.660 --> 04:36.826
It's kind of a no-brainer.

04:36.894 --> 04:39.228
Hmm.

04:39.296 --> 04:40.430
How are we doing here?

04:40.497 --> 04:41.665
How are you?

04:41.732 --> 04:42.832
I'm good, Kevin.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.034
I'm Dr. Whalen.

04:44.101 --> 04:45.234
Please call me Pete.

04:45.302 --> 04:47.671
I'm be... I'll... (Kevin laughs)

04:47.738 --> 04:48.838
That's good.

04:48.906 --> 04:50.040
What's that?

04:50.107 --> 04:51.240
That's good. Okay.

04:51.308 --> 04:52.241
Ruxin put you up to that?

04:52.309 --> 04:53.443
That's funny.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.445
I'm sorry. I don't... Is he here? Ruxin?

04:55.512 --> 04:56.446
I don't know who that is.

04:56.513 --> 05:00.050
He didn't tell you to tell me that your
name was Pete just to mess with me?

05:00.117 --> 05:02.251
Uh, no. My name actually is-is Pete.

05:02.319 --> 05:03.453
Aah. All right.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.689
Anyway, the procedure takes
a little under an hour.

05:05.756 --> 05:07.857
You've clearly already
had your anesthesia.

05:07.925 --> 05:09.859
Uh, we'll be inserting a small
tube with a camera at the end of

05:09.927 --> 05:11.861
it into the rectum, and then
up through the colon, and, uh,

05:11.929 --> 05:13.863
later on today, you're going
to experience some bloating,

05:13.931 --> 05:14.864
probably some mild flatulence.

05:14.932 --> 05:16.032
Normal.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.034
Um, that's probably why you're...
why you're here.

05:18.102 --> 05:19.035
Can I see it?

05:19.103 --> 05:20.036
I'm so sorry.

05:20.104 --> 05:21.037
Can you see what?

05:21.105 --> 05:22.238
The camera tube?

05:22.306 --> 05:23.439
Oh.

05:23.507 --> 05:24.641
Camera tube?

05:24.709 --> 05:27.043
You know, I have to advise against that.

05:27.111 --> 05:28.244
Yeah.

05:28.312 --> 05:29.245
I want to see it.

05:29.313 --> 05:31.247
It is, in my professional
opinion, that you shouldn't.

05:31.315 --> 05:34.450
In my non-professional opinion...
Well, right there.

05:34.518 --> 05:36.452
How about if I brought over
some food, and made you close

05:36.520 --> 05:38.454
your eyes and just shoved
it into your mouth?

05:38.522 --> 05:39.656
Would you like that?

05:39.724 --> 05:41.091
That's a fair point.

05:41.158 --> 05:42.291
All right.

05:42.359 --> 05:43.493
Thank you.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.494
It's really not a big deal.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.495
Okay, okay.

05:45.562 --> 05:46.496
Here is the tube.

05:46.563 --> 05:47.731
Oh, my God.

05:47.798 --> 05:49.899
Now, don't... It's... Oh, my God!

05:49.967 --> 05:50.934
It's very small.

05:51.002 --> 05:51.935
What's this part?

05:52.003 --> 05:52.936
This isn't going in.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.137
That won't fit.

05:54.204 --> 05:56.072
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. Relax.

05:56.140 --> 05:57.273
It won't fit.

05:57.341 --> 05:58.274
This stays on the outside.

05:58.342 --> 06:00.476
This is just for me so I can do this.

06:00.544 --> 06:01.678
Oh. Oh, my God! It moves!

06:01.746 --> 06:05.314
Yeah. I have full control over
where we're looking in there.

06:05.382 --> 06:06.315
This is a horrible mistake.

06:06.383 --> 06:07.517
No, it isn't. No, Kevin.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.919
You should never show <i>anybody that.</i>

06:09.987 --> 06:12.122
<i>Well, I did warn you about that.</i>

06:12.189 --> 06:15.759
<i>Listen, if at any time, you're uncomfortable...
Yeah, right now.</i>

06:15.826 --> 06:17.827
<i>As in, right now, this time...
Let's just... let's keep an</i>

06:17.895 --> 06:18.762
<i>open dialogue then, okay?</i>

06:18.829 --> 06:19.763
<i>"Pete, be gentle."</i>

06:19.830 --> 06:20.764
<i>"Pete, that's too rough."</i>

06:20.831 --> 06:21.765
<i>"Pete, you've gone too deep."</i>

06:21.832 --> 06:23.767
<i>Hopefully, "Pete, you went in,
you went out, and I didn't</i>

06:23.834 --> 06:24.934
<i>even feel it."</i>

06:25.002 --> 06:25.935
<i>Let's just keep talking.</i>

06:26.003 --> 06:27.937
<i>Pete and Kevin are in
this together, okay?</i>

06:28.005 --> 06:30.140
<i>And if Pete's not around, Jenny's here.</i>

06:30.207 --> 06:32.341
<i>Say, "Jenny, this feels really great."</i>

06:32.409 --> 06:34.544
<i>Well, Pete... Oh, God. Let's just do it.</i>

06:34.611 --> 06:36.546
<i>Okay, let's just let Pete
take care of everything.</i>

06:36.613 --> 06:38.715
<i>Oh!</i>

06:45.632 --> 06:47.755
Hey, Gumma, I got your message.
What's going on?

06:48.040 --> 06:50.974
Oh, I came to see Duke, and I couldn't find him.
I... He wasn't in his room.

06:51.043 --> 06:53.305
He wasn't anywhere.

06:53.425 --> 06:55.117
It's, like... All right,
listen, I'm here.

06:55.212 --> 06:58.314
I don't want you to worry about anything;
I'm gonna go find our Gumpa, okay?

06:58.382 --> 06:59.982
Oh, thank you, honey.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.718
Gumpa Duke?

07:02.785 --> 07:04.220
Hello?

07:04.287 --> 07:07.123
(man and woman moaning)

07:07.190 --> 07:11.060
Oh, God, this is fantastic.

07:11.128 --> 07:12.861
WOMAN: Oh, Duke, oh.

07:12.929 --> 07:14.897
Oh, Duke, yes!

07:14.964 --> 07:16.732
(moans)

07:16.799 --> 07:18.901
(moaning)

07:18.968 --> 07:20.869
Oh, Duke!

07:20.937 --> 07:26.411
Oh, you wonderful, wonderful...
(groans) Gumpa!

07:26.531 --> 07:27.464
Gumpa, no, no!

07:27.532 --> 07:29.466
Gumpa, get that... get that out of there.

07:29.534 --> 07:30.467
Gumpa!

07:30.535 --> 07:32.068
(gasps) Who are you?

07:32.136 --> 07:32.931
Gumpa, this is not your wife!

07:33.051 --> 07:34.256
It's not my wife?

07:34.376 --> 07:35.643
No, this is not your wife!

07:35.763 --> 07:36.774
This is not my room?

07:36.894 --> 07:41.101
No, no, but your real wife is
in this building right now, so

07:41.221 --> 07:43.814
we're gonna have... Oh, my God.

07:43.881 --> 07:44.815
Condoms, really?

07:44.882 --> 07:45.793
What do you think, you're
gonna get her pregnant?

07:45.913 --> 07:46.772
You can never be too safe.

07:46.892 --> 07:48.094
Okay, enough, enough.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.095
You need to put this on.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.498
We need to get out of here.

07:51.566 --> 07:54.034
This is full-on adultery.

07:54.101 --> 07:55.502
This is not Alzheimer's.

07:55.570 --> 07:57.804
So he is treating this
old-age home like a dorm.

07:57.872 --> 07:58.805
Oh, yeah, he's loving it.

07:58.873 --> 08:01.875
He's just, like, cruising the halls
looking for horny old widows.

08:01.942 --> 08:02.976
He's got the condoms.

08:03.044 --> 08:04.978
It's like Spring Break 1936 for him.

08:05.046 --> 08:06.980
I got to say, I know he's your
grandpa and he's cheating

08:07.048 --> 08:09.049
on your grandma, but I
respect him even more now.

08:09.116 --> 08:11.518
Gumpa's a goddamn genius is what he is.

08:11.586 --> 08:12.786
I'm gonna start doing that.

08:12.853 --> 08:14.954
I just can't ever remember
what the disease is called.

08:15.022 --> 08:15.955
Alzheimer's.

08:16.023 --> 08:17.457
No, that's not it.

08:17.525 --> 08:19.726
Well, well, well, if it
isn't the trade rapist.

08:19.794 --> 08:21.127
Uh, I'm sorry, what?

08:21.196 --> 08:22.128
Are you kidding me?

08:22.197 --> 08:24.130
You trade-raped me in
the doctor's office.

08:24.199 --> 08:27.634
I was drugged to the gills, and you took
advantage of me and my running backs.

08:27.702 --> 08:29.869
I did not trade-rape you.

08:29.937 --> 08:31.338
I traded <i>with</i> you.

08:31.406 --> 08:33.307
No, it wasn't consensual.

08:33.374 --> 08:36.309
In what world would I possibly
give you Trent Richardson and

08:36.376 --> 08:38.178
Reggie Bush for Pierre Garcon?

08:38.246 --> 08:40.847
Okay, let me refresh your
memory on how it went down...

08:40.914 --> 08:44.217
I wanted to thank you for taking time
out of your day to come and pick me up.

08:44.284 --> 08:45.219
It means a lot.

08:45.286 --> 08:46.220
Hey, anything for friends.

08:46.287 --> 08:47.221
Yes, for friends.

08:47.288 --> 08:48.222
Best friends.

08:48.289 --> 08:49.223
Best friends.

08:49.290 --> 08:50.224
RUXIN/PETE: Bullshit!

08:50.291 --> 08:51.225
Thank you.

08:51.292 --> 08:52.226
Not bullshit.

08:52.293 --> 08:55.529
Then you informed me about this
"running back" problem that you had.

08:55.597 --> 08:59.099
I have so many running backs, and I
constantly am playing the wrong ones.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.100
It's so frustrating.

09:00.167 --> 09:02.202
What I could really use is a tight end.

09:02.270 --> 09:05.205
Uh, well, you should've thought
of that before the colonoscopy.

09:05.273 --> 09:06.440
(chuckling)

09:06.507 --> 09:09.008
Man, your wit is so quick.

09:09.076 --> 09:10.009
Thank you.

09:10.077 --> 09:11.245
Let's talk trade.

09:11.312 --> 09:12.546
All right.

09:12.614 --> 09:13.580
Here we go.

09:13.648 --> 09:14.581
Great.

09:14.649 --> 09:16.850
I am <i>so</i> lucid right now.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.052
This is probably the
best thing we can do.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.722
Then we saw <i>Lincoln,</i> which we
loved, I dropped you off at

09:21.789 --> 09:24.291
home, high-fived, and the night was over.

09:24.359 --> 09:26.360
Do you really think that's
what happened, Andre?

09:26.427 --> 09:27.794
I know that's what happened.

09:27.862 --> 09:31.931
Well, here's how I remember it...
Hello, young Kevin.

09:31.999 --> 09:33.267
(chuckles drowsily)

09:33.334 --> 09:35.902
It's... the Dre.

09:35.970 --> 09:38.572
Oh, God, that shirt is awful.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.440
Now, let's talk running backs.

09:40.508 --> 09:42.108
You've got them and I want them.

09:42.176 --> 09:44.110
(weakly): You know I don't have 'em.

09:44.178 --> 09:45.111
Do it.

09:45.179 --> 09:46.112
I don't.

09:46.180 --> 09:47.113
Do it.

09:47.181 --> 09:48.114
(crying): No.

09:48.182 --> 09:51.385
(cackling evilly)

09:51.452 --> 09:54.721
I'm taking advantage of you!

09:54.789 --> 09:56.055
(cackling)

09:56.123 --> 09:57.824
You trade-roofied me.

09:57.892 --> 09:59.826
Just 'cause you made a bad trade
doesn't mean that you can

09:59.894 --> 10:01.828
just cry and then we can
change it at the last second.

10:01.896 --> 10:04.831
No, I made a bad decision by having
you pick me up from the hospital.

10:04.899 --> 10:06.833
I didn't come here to have
my character assassinated.

10:06.901 --> 10:08.835
Like Lincoln in the end of
the movie, spoiler alert.

10:08.903 --> 10:09.836
But you should see it.

10:09.904 --> 10:10.837
It's really good.

10:10.905 --> 10:12.172
So I am out.

10:12.239 --> 10:13.407
Good day.

10:13.474 --> 10:14.408
Unbelievable.

10:14.475 --> 10:15.409
Wow.

10:15.476 --> 10:17.411
I mean, Ruxin, you got to
do something about this.

10:17.478 --> 10:19.446
This is your first big
decision as Commissioner.

10:19.514 --> 10:22.449
Well, I will review all the
facts, and I will make a fair

10:22.517 --> 10:24.851
and impartial decision in due time.

10:24.919 --> 10:26.853
No, no, I want a decision now.

10:26.921 --> 10:27.854
I want my players back.

10:27.922 --> 10:30.256
Buddy, you watched peewee
football refs blow calls in the

10:30.325 --> 10:33.660
NFL for five weeks, you can
wait a minute for my decision.

10:33.728 --> 10:35.862
Got to say, I'm loving the valet.

10:35.930 --> 10:37.163
Yeah, me first.

10:37.231 --> 10:38.765
Oh... Yeah, there it is.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.600
(phone rings)

10:40.668 --> 10:41.601
Hey, what's up, Andre?

10:41.669 --> 10:42.602
Not cool, Ruxin, not cool.

10:42.670 --> 10:43.603
You were there, okay?

10:43.671 --> 10:45.472
And you said you were gonna protect me.

10:45.540 --> 10:46.606
I can't... I can't hear you.

10:46.674 --> 10:47.607
ANDRE (over car Bluetooth):

10:47.675 --> 10:49.609
You told me, "Andre, I got your back.

10:49.677 --> 10:51.611
Andre, I'll protect you in this."

10:51.679 --> 10:52.512
(echoing over Bluetooth):

10:52.580 --> 10:54.614
I'll call you... I'll
call you back, okay?

10:54.682 --> 10:55.615
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:55.683 --> 10:56.616
No, I'll call you back.

10:56.684 --> 10:57.617
ANDRE (over car Bluetooth):

10:57.685 --> 10:59.619
Everyone's pissed off at me and why?

10:59.687 --> 11:01.688
Because you can't keep a promise!

11:01.756 --> 11:03.189
You always love a trade, Ruxin!

11:03.257 --> 11:05.492
You were in the room with me and Kevin.

11:05.560 --> 11:06.827
I'll call you right back!

11:06.894 --> 11:10.564
Uh, Ruxin, we heard Andre
through the goddamn car.

11:10.631 --> 11:11.498
What the hell's going on?

11:11.566 --> 11:13.567
That's not my car and that's not Andre.

11:13.634 --> 11:14.568
Tell us the truth.

11:14.635 --> 11:15.702
Fine!

11:15.770 --> 11:18.805
I showed up at the doctor's
office to make sure that

11:18.873 --> 11:21.307
everything was on the up and up.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.676
You finish the trade yet?

11:22.744 --> 11:23.677
Would you like Percy Harvin?

11:23.745 --> 11:24.678
I don't give a shit.

11:24.746 --> 11:25.679
Just give me someone.

11:25.747 --> 11:26.680
They're all junk anyway.

11:26.748 --> 11:27.681
Get it done.

11:27.749 --> 11:29.649
Oh, my God, what's going on in here?

11:29.717 --> 11:32.252
(narrating): Kevin was
a farty, loopy mess.

11:32.319 --> 11:36.155
Andre is taking this hot, sour wind
that Kevin is passing on to him.

11:36.223 --> 11:39.158
I'm gonna give you Pierre Garcon, and
I'm gonna take Reggie Bush and Trent

11:39.226 --> 11:40.159
Richardson.

11:40.227 --> 11:41.160
Done.

11:41.228 --> 11:42.996
But let's seal it with a kiss.

11:43.063 --> 11:45.098
RUXIN (narrating): That room
smelled like a bucket of

11:45.165 --> 11:48.067
cauliflower had lit a
pile of shit on fire.

11:48.135 --> 11:50.771
Oh, God, it smells like a
can of tuna had diarrhea.

11:50.838 --> 11:53.273
(narrating): I mean, this room
smelled like Nick Nolte and Gary

11:53.340 --> 11:56.175
Busey were doing squats in there.

11:56.243 --> 11:57.243
Was it trade-rape or not?

11:57.311 --> 12:00.914
Okay, under oath, I couldn't
tell if that was Kevin being

12:00.981 --> 12:05.118
drugged up or his general
ape-like cavorting.

12:05.185 --> 12:06.686
Andre, hold me up.

12:06.754 --> 12:07.888
(Andre groaning)

12:07.955 --> 12:09.022
Oh! Shh, shh, shh, shh!

12:09.089 --> 12:10.023
(farts)

12:10.090 --> 12:12.959
RUXIN (narrating): All I can say
for sure is that this place

12:13.027 --> 12:15.562
smelled like a Cambodian war prison.

12:15.630 --> 12:17.564
It seemed to be a fair trade to me.

12:17.632 --> 12:19.766
(groans) That's really
just bullshit, Ruxin.

12:19.834 --> 12:22.402
You failed to protect the
integrity of the league, Ruxin.

12:22.470 --> 12:24.438
And, look, that's neither
here nor there, okay?

12:24.505 --> 12:27.707
None of us here can be objective
about this, and we got to figure

12:27.775 --> 12:28.742
out a way to solve this.

12:28.810 --> 12:33.980
I know someone who can
help us out with this.

12:34.048 --> 12:36.215
I've heard what you guys have
to say, and I just want to say,

12:36.283 --> 12:40.119
like, I'm-I'm honored that you trust
me to make this decision for you.

12:40.187 --> 12:41.788
No. We don't trust you.

12:41.856 --> 12:42.789
Oh, sorry.

12:42.857 --> 12:43.824
I'm being super-rude.

12:43.891 --> 12:46.159
I don't have any chairs for you
guys to sit on. I'm sorry.

12:46.226 --> 12:47.260
Raffi.

12:47.328 --> 12:48.462
What about all those chairs?

12:48.529 --> 12:49.463
Yeah, what about those?

12:49.530 --> 12:51.465
Oh, no, those are load-bearing chairs.

12:51.532 --> 12:52.899
Toilet-kitchen's open.

12:52.967 --> 12:54.968
Anybody want a cup of
coffee or take a shit?

12:55.035 --> 12:55.969
Ooh, I'll take a coffee.

12:56.036 --> 12:56.970
You know what, Taco?

12:57.037 --> 13:00.774
I'm not sure how fresh that
coffee or poop is, so you might

13:00.842 --> 13:03.577
not want to drink that, to be honest.

13:03.644 --> 13:06.613
So, you have the facts in front
of you, and it'd be best

13:06.681 --> 13:07.614
if you just made a decision.

13:07.682 --> 13:09.583
Yeah, okay. (sighs)

13:09.650 --> 13:11.985
My brain biscuits are turning.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.354
I've got a lot of experience
with roofies and rape, so that's

13:14.421 --> 13:16.255
good news for you guys.

13:16.323 --> 13:17.457
I'm gonna figure this out.

13:17.525 --> 13:19.526
I'm gonna crack the code.

13:19.594 --> 13:23.463
I'll have your decision in 24 hours. I'm...
ALL: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:23.531 --> 13:24.464
Hey, hey, Raffi.

13:24.532 --> 13:26.466
What are you doing, buddy?

13:26.534 --> 13:28.101
Oh, Jesus Christ.

13:28.168 --> 13:30.436
Are you shooting heroin now?

13:30.505 --> 13:31.605
No, this isn't heroin.

13:31.672 --> 13:32.606
It's insulin.

13:32.673 --> 13:33.807
I'm diabetic.

13:33.875 --> 13:37.210
You do know that a heroin
addiction is not diabetes, right?

13:37.277 --> 13:38.277
I don't do heroin, guys.

13:38.345 --> 13:39.880
I only shoot up medicine.

13:39.947 --> 13:41.848
I smoke drugs. Like bath salts.

13:41.916 --> 13:42.949
You on bath salts right now?

13:43.017 --> 13:43.950
Oh, yeah, big time.

13:44.018 --> 13:47.053
(door opens)

13:47.121 --> 13:49.455
I'm here to fix your toilet-kitchen.

13:49.524 --> 13:50.524
Now's not a good time, okay?

13:50.591 --> 13:51.992
I have guests.

13:52.059 --> 13:54.227
I'm gonna come back and
fix your toilet-kitchen.

13:54.294 --> 13:56.897
Okay, good, please do because
something's clogging it up.

13:56.964 --> 14:01.134
It's either... a giant shit I took or the
lasagna I tried to shove down there.

14:01.201 --> 14:02.201
Did you take my cat?

14:02.269 --> 14:05.705
It's not even your cat, really; it's
a cat that lives in the building.

14:05.773 --> 14:07.173
I take care of that cat.

14:07.241 --> 14:08.408
I give him milk.

14:08.475 --> 14:10.376
I give him food every day.

14:10.444 --> 14:11.878
It's my cat.

14:11.946 --> 14:13.312
You took it.

14:13.380 --> 14:14.514
I didn't take your cat.

14:14.582 --> 14:16.516
I'm going to come back
and fix that later.

14:16.584 --> 14:19.185
Good, come back and unclog it, please.

14:19.253 --> 14:20.186
(door slams)

14:20.254 --> 14:22.488
Spoiler alert: guess what he's
going to find when he unclogs

14:22.557 --> 14:24.157
it: his (bleep) cat.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:33.221 --> 14:35.622
Maybe we should go grab a beer.

14:35.689 --> 14:38.057
I'll take you for a walk and
get you some apple juice.

14:38.126 --> 14:39.058
Come on.

14:52.706 --> 14:54.774
Nobody's got you, Quiz.

14:54.842 --> 14:56.176

Oh, shit.

15:28.008 --> 15:29.042
Sorry, sorry.

I was just trying to get power.

15:30.278 --> 15:31.378
We're... we're good.

15:31.445 --> 15:32.379

15:32.446 --> 15:33.846
Plug that back in.

15:33.914 --> 15:35.282
Okay, we're back.

15:35.349 --> 15:36.883
Wendy, my darling.

15:36.950 --> 15:38.885
Oh, are you all right?

15:38.952 --> 15:40.053
Oh, yes.

What are you doing?

15:44.346 --> 15:45.130
Duke!

15:45.250 --> 15:47.227
Get up.

15:47.295 --> 15:49.329
Who was that woman I...?

15:49.397 --> 15:51.731
I am a very, very sick man.

15:51.799 --> 15:53.728
Oh, sure you are.

15:53.848 --> 15:55.782
Come on, honey, you're going
home right this minute.

15:55.850 --> 15:56.783
No.

15:56.851 --> 15:58.785
You are going to do the dishes.

15:58.853 --> 15:59.786
Petey.

15:59.854 --> 16:01.788
You're going to take out the
garbage, and you are going to

16:01.856 --> 16:02.789
drive me home right now!

16:02.857 --> 16:03.790
No, no, I'm not.

16:03.858 --> 16:04.791
I like it here.

16:04.859 --> 16:06.793
Pete, Petey... Get out here.

16:06.861 --> 16:07.794
Sorry, Grandpa.

16:07.862 --> 16:08.795
Bye, Duke!

16:08.863 --> 16:10.930
I am loving my team.

16:10.998 --> 16:12.065
Look at me.

16:12.133 --> 16:13.367
Watch out.

16:13.434 --> 16:14.368
Oh, oh!

16:14.435 --> 16:16.303
Hey, hey!

16:16.371 --> 16:19.640
(grunts, sighs)

16:21.041 --> 16:22.409
(muffled yelling)

16:22.477 --> 16:24.043
Go to sleep, Brian.

16:24.111 --> 16:26.413
I'll be here when you wake up.

16:28.483 --> 16:30.116
(panting)

16:30.184 --> 16:31.652
No...!

16:39.294 --> 16:40.294
Hey, Brian!

16:40.361 --> 16:41.295
Get up!

16:41.362 --> 16:42.496
Brian, hey, hey.

16:42.563 --> 16:43.963
You got to wake up, man.

16:44.031 --> 16:45.098
Hey, seriously.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.400
Come on, come on.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.399
You got to wake up, man.

16:47.487 --> 16:49.421
We got to get in there right now.

16:49.489 --> 16:50.422
Oh, God!

16:50.490 --> 16:51.590
It's your best friend, Raffi.

16:51.657 --> 16:52.724
I hate you.

16:52.792 --> 16:53.572
Listen to me, okay?

16:53.660 --> 16:56.762
You guys asked me to settle a dispute,
okay, and that's what I'm doing.

16:56.830 --> 16:59.632
I drugged you, I kidnapped
you A-Team-style.

16:59.700 --> 17:00.666
Oh, my God.

17:00.734 --> 17:03.302
And now we are going to
settle this like men.

17:03.370 --> 17:07.940
Because the only justice is in <i>la lucha!</i>

17:13.046 --> 17:14.012
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

17:14.079 --> 17:17.281
<i>Although, tonight, he is just
somebody you are here to murder.</i>

17:17.349 --> 17:18.617
<i>Okay?</i>

17:18.685 --> 17:19.652
<i>(bell dings)</i>

17:19.720 --> 17:20.987

<i>Fight!</i>

17:39.406 --> 17:41.707
<i>Come on!</i>

17:41.775 --> 17:44.677
<i>Just admit that you trade-raped me.</i>

17:44.745 --> 17:45.678
<i>You got us into this mess.</i>

17:45.746 --> 17:46.679
<i>Now get us out.</i>

17:46.747 --> 17:47.680
<i>I did not trade-rape you.</i>

17:47.748 --> 17:49.849
<i>What the hell is this place, Taco?</i>

17:49.917 --> 17:51.017
<i>What is going on?</i>

17:51.084 --> 17:52.151
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:52.218 --> 17:54.554
<i>I only come here on Tuesdays
for kangaroo fighting.</i>

17:54.621 --> 17:56.656
<i>By the way, don't eat
anything off the floor.</i>

17:56.723 --> 17:58.658
<i>And Raffi told you Kevin would be here?</i>

17:58.725 --> 18:00.860
<i>'Cause he was supposed to
meet me for date night.</i>

18:00.928 --> 18:02.528
<i>Oh, there he is.</i>

18:02.596 --> 18:03.763

18:10.503 --> 18:12.337
<i>Kevin, what are you doing?</i>

18:12.405 --> 18:13.673
<i>What is he doing?</i>

18:13.740 --> 18:16.876
<i>Only one of you can leave the ring alive!</i>

18:16.944 --> 18:18.878
<i>You accepted that trade willingly.</i>

18:18.946 --> 18:20.880
<i>I would never accept a
trade from you willingly.</i>

18:20.948 --> 18:21.881
<i>Because you're a moron!</i>

18:21.949 --> 18:25.184
<i>At least I don't have an
asterisk on my trophy.</i>

18:25.251 --> 18:26.552
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

18:26.620 --> 18:28.721
<i>Your championship was a joke, Andre.</i>
