WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.460
NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:04.570 --> 00:07.230
The Rand Protectorate
and the Caledonian Federation

00:07.340 --> 00:09.200
have been locked in a state cold war
for decades.

00:10.310 --> 00:11.270
(EXPLOSION)

00:12.570 --> 00:13.600
This is insane.

00:13.710 --> 00:15.900
Soren's forces are moving in
on this facility.

00:16.010 --> 00:18.240
I can get you to the stargate,
but we have to go now.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.010
I'm not blind, Leda. I know
that you and Daniel

00:20.120 --> 00:21.480
have grown close
during his convalescence.

00:21.580 --> 00:22.740
Jarrod, it's not what you think.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.410
I've seen entire planets wiped out
because they refused to follow the Ori.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.120
If a Prior visits your world,

00:30.330 --> 00:31.350
Ieave.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.090
-What's up?
-lncoming wormhole from Tegalus.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.370
A Jarrod Kane is requesting
to be let through.

00:46.470 --> 00:48.340
Says he needs to speak to you
and it's urgent.

00:48.940 --> 00:50.410
On radio.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.910
Jarrod, this is Daniel. What's wrong?

00:53.010 --> 00:54.980
KANE ON RADIO: Dr. Jackson,
I have very Iittle time.

00:55.350 --> 00:58.410
I've gained access to the stargate
without my government's authorization.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.010
PIease allow me to come through.
I am alone and unarmed.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.550
Open the iris.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.920
Okay, Jarrod, it's safe to come through.

01:13.770 --> 01:15.170
Stand down.

01:16.770 --> 01:17.760
Dr. Jackson.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.360
Jarrod, this is
Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.070
Tegalus.

01:22.510 --> 01:25.710
Post-apocalyptic warring superpowers
with deep-seated political differences.

01:25.810 --> 01:27.650
That Jarrod Kane. It's nice to meet you.

01:27.750 --> 01:30.270
Your government stopped responding
to our communiquÃ©s months ago.

01:30.390 --> 01:33.290
-We assumed that you...
-Completely destroyed each other?

01:33.520 --> 01:34.510
Not quite yet.

01:34.620 --> 01:37.350
I was gonna say "no longer wanted
our help" but that'll do.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.980
No, the Rand Protectorate
is still struggling to rebuild

01:40.100 --> 01:42.150
and defend itself
from the Caledonian Federation.

01:43.100 --> 01:44.900
Okay, what's so urgent?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.160
Five months ago,
a man came through the stargate.

01:47.740 --> 01:51.100
-He called himself a Prior of the Ori.
-Here we go.

01:51.210 --> 01:53.700
Yes, we're aware of the Priors
and what they're preaching.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.800
KANE: The Prior wasn't
just offering us religion.

01:55.910 --> 01:57.070
He offered us power.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.700
In exchange for our embracing the Ori,

01:58.810 --> 02:00.280
he gave our government designs
for a weapon

02:00.380 --> 02:02.180
that could be launched into orbit.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.540
A satellite capable of giving us
total domination over the Caledonians.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.990
Okay, assuming your people intend
on building this weapon,

02:11.090 --> 02:12.580
how long before it's completed?

02:12.690 --> 02:15.420
Twenty-four hours ago,
a Caledonian military outpost

02:15.530 --> 02:18.120
was completely vaporized
in a demonstration.

02:19.070 --> 02:21.190
The weapon is already operational.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.000
MlTCHELL: How long
until your government

03:32.110 --> 03:33.130
makes its next move?

03:33.710 --> 03:36.970
Our president has given their leader,
Minister Chaska, a deadline of five days.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.770
After that, if the Caledonians
don't surrender to Rand occupation,

03:39.880 --> 03:40.970
they'll be destroyed.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.210
And the Prior instructed you to do this?

03:43.320 --> 03:46.410
Rand has been in disarray
since the missile attacks last year.

03:46.820 --> 03:48.720
Intelligence reports were filtering in
that said

03:48.820 --> 03:51.090
the Caledonians were preparing
a full-scale ground assault.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.350
They were going to invade

03:52.460 --> 03:55.160
and attempt to topple
what was left of Rand once and for all.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.990
Caledonia wasn't interested
in hearing from this Prior?

03:58.130 --> 03:59.400
The Prior asked our leaders

03:59.500 --> 04:01.700
if he could spread his word
to the Caledonians as well.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.200
JACKSON: Of course,
they would never accept anything

04:03.300 --> 04:05.070
that Rand was already embracing.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.540
President Nadal
explained that to the Prior.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.740
He said anyone who didn't accept Origin
must be destroyed.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.750
Man, these guys got
a bottomless bag of tricks, don't they?

04:13.850 --> 04:15.780
I'm guessing it was also the Prior
that convinced your people

04:15.880 --> 04:18.250
that having a relationship with us
was no longer necessary.

04:18.350 --> 04:20.980
It was already clear your government
wasn't going to offer us

04:21.090 --> 04:24.620
the type of weapons and technology
this Prior was offering us.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.960
You see, we weren't
just on the verge of suffering defeat

04:28.060 --> 04:29.860
at the hands of the Caledonians.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.300
We were on the verge of collapsing
as a nation.

04:32.900 --> 04:36.030
But now after what you've told me
of these Ori and their Priors,

04:36.670 --> 04:38.400
I fear that may have been
a better way to go.

04:38.510 --> 04:42.570
We appreciate your situation,
but what exactly do you want from us?

04:43.140 --> 04:45.540
These are the earliest schematics
for the weapon.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.210
Unfortunately, they're not complete.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.310
The Prior gave us
step-by-step instructions in stages.

04:51.420 --> 04:53.350
Making sure he kept you under his thumb.

04:53.450 --> 04:54.940
KANE: He said it was
so he could make sure

04:55.060 --> 04:56.520
each stage was completed properly

04:56.620 --> 04:58.320
before we moved on to the next.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.450
It's the best I could do
under the circumstances.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.960
Access became restricted
soon after some of us in government

05:04.070 --> 05:06.430
voiced our disapproval
about building the weapon.

05:06.630 --> 05:08.600
You wish us to destroy the weapon?

05:08.700 --> 05:11.760
It's the only chance we have
to stop things before they go too far.

05:14.380 --> 05:18.710
Just to be clear,
you're doing this to save Caledonians?

05:19.780 --> 05:21.870
You don't hate them
for bombing your country

05:21.980 --> 05:24.610
-and killing so many of your people?
-I do,

05:25.620 --> 05:29.610
but I refuse to see any more lives,
be they Rand or Caledonian,

05:29.720 --> 05:34.820
senselessly lost due to archaic prejudices
or religious extremism.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.360
This has to stop.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.230
Would you excuse us for a moment?

05:53.110 --> 05:55.740
-What are we doing?
-Talking privately.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.110
I'm sure General Landry won't mind.

05:58.490 --> 06:01.980
-You want the big chair?
-Not me. I'll sit here.

06:02.220 --> 06:05.720
-Sam, he's in Washington.
-Yeah.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.630
Right.

06:16.540 --> 06:20.000
JACKSON: Let me just start this by saying
a lot of this is actually our fault.

06:20.310 --> 06:21.940
There wouldn't have been a war
on Tegalus

06:22.040 --> 06:23.670
if we hadn't gone there in the first place.

06:23.780 --> 06:26.580
General O'Neill probably said it best.
"The minute we step through the gates,

06:26.680 --> 06:29.170
"we're sticking our collective noses
where they don't belong."

06:29.280 --> 06:31.250
We did offer to help them rebuild.

06:31.590 --> 06:33.780
An offer they eventually declined.

06:33.890 --> 06:35.860
Because they were being influenced
by a Prior.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.180
Yeah, and this satellite thing
takes it to a whole new level.

06:39.290 --> 06:40.920
The Ori are now arming their followers.

06:41.030 --> 06:42.960
Who says they won't eventually
help them build ships

06:43.060 --> 06:45.160
capable of attacking other planets?

06:45.270 --> 06:47.560
We need to nip this trend
squarely in the bud.

06:48.300 --> 06:50.830
So, what, we just fly in there
and blow it up?

06:51.540 --> 06:52.530
Yeah.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.540
Unless you have a better idea.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.270
All Tegalans, both Rand and Caledonian
alike, deserve to know the truth.

06:59.610 --> 07:02.810
If we tell them what we know,
who the Ori really are,

07:02.980 --> 07:05.750
they might be convinced
to dismantle this weapon themselves.

07:06.450 --> 07:07.920
You think they'll listen?

07:08.020 --> 07:11.360
Let's just propose it to Kane
and see if Rand will hear us out.

07:15.660 --> 07:20.100
MlTCHELL: So, can we can use these plans
to build ourselves a satellite weapon?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.560
Hey, you gotta ask.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.200
These plans are incomplete.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.070
I mean, it's not even clear
what's powering the weapon.

07:26.170 --> 07:28.440
Kane did say they were early schematics.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.140
So, not useful?

07:30.410 --> 07:32.500
Well, enough to see
that it's not very efficient.

07:32.610 --> 07:35.780
For example, these capacitors

07:35.880 --> 07:38.820
take several minutes to store
enough power to fire the weapon,

07:38.920 --> 07:40.850
and then again before it can repeat.

07:41.390 --> 07:44.420
Why, you'd think an Ori weapon
would be more advanced.

07:44.530 --> 07:47.320
Well, the Ori may have designed it
for them, but Rand still had to build it

07:47.430 --> 07:50.330
using the resources and technology
at their disposal.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.860
Now, remember that it wouldn't
take much by our standards

07:52.970 --> 07:56.130
to give Rand vast military superiority
over Caledonia.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.500
Then it can be easily destroyed.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.800
-lf these plans are an accurate indication.
-MlTCHELL: Right.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.710
So, we'll take Prometheus for this.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.440
Shouldn't be a problem.

08:05.550 --> 08:08.740
The satellite appears to be
a predominantly offensive weapon.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.710
-No defenses?
-Well, it stands to reason.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.960
Rand knows that Caledonia has nothing
even close to capable of reaching orbit.

08:17.060 --> 08:20.650
Although, there do appear to be sensors
built into the targeting system,

08:20.760 --> 08:22.560
so our approach may be detected.

08:22.660 --> 08:25.830
The Prometheus is protected
by Asgard shield technology.

08:25.930 --> 08:29.300
Exactly. Now, as I said,
even if they do see us coming,

08:29.400 --> 08:31.600
the weapon will take
a few minutes to charge up.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.670
We should be able to emerge
from hyperspace

08:33.780 --> 08:36.110
and take a shot at it before it can respond.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.970
If for any reason it doesn't go well,
we jump back into hyperspace.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.480
Anything yet?

08:47.120 --> 08:50.820
Give them some time.
They seemed shocked that you were here.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.320
I'm sure they were.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.060
You don't think they'll listen to us?

09:04.410 --> 09:07.140
Our people suffered greatly after the war.

09:08.580 --> 09:12.030
They needed to believe there was a reason
for what was happening to them.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.980
And the Prior provided that.

09:14.180 --> 09:18.240
He said our suffering was a test
to see who was worthy.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.620
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
your planet's not alone.

09:27.260 --> 09:29.200
Kane, I have to ask.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.730
Leda...

09:37.910 --> 09:42.070
Five months ago, while Rand was deciding
whether to accept Origin or not,

09:42.910 --> 09:44.380
a disease swept through the country.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.410
Thousands became deathly ill.

09:50.650 --> 09:54.450
The Prior said those who believed
and embraced the Ori would be cured.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.780
That's when people everywhere
began accepting them as gods.

10:01.430 --> 10:04.190
We watched so many

10:05.730 --> 10:08.730
barter away their beliefs
in exchange for their lives.

10:12.940 --> 10:14.530
But Leda, she...

10:17.710 --> 10:19.580
She refused to accept it.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.650
I am sorry.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.850
Dr. Jackson, we just received
a communiquÃ© from the Rand government.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.630
They want to talk.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.900
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

10:47.610 --> 10:49.940
What happens if your people
don't hear from us?

10:50.240 --> 10:53.210
I told them to proceed
with destroying the weapon.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.830
-President Nadal.
-Senator Kane.

11:11.670 --> 11:14.660
-This is Dr. Daniel Jackson.
-I know who he is.

11:14.870 --> 11:17.530
I'm here representing Earth
on a diplomatic mission.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.940
I'm here to officially inform you,
Jarrod Kane,

11:20.040 --> 11:23.570
-you are under arrest for treason.
-Excuse me?

11:23.950 --> 11:26.040
You allowed us to come here
under false pretenses?

11:26.150 --> 11:30.410
Dr. Daniel Jackson, your government
has knowingly harbored a felon.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.210
As well, it seems they are
in possession of top-secret documents

11:33.320 --> 11:35.260
vital to the security of this country.

11:35.360 --> 11:39.050
As of now, you are both
considered enemies of the state

11:39.160 --> 11:42.100
and will be detained until trial can be set.

11:59.310 --> 12:01.080
Approaching the planet, sir.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.150
Prepare to lock on Dr. Jackson's
locator beacon

12:03.250 --> 12:06.120
-the moment we drop out of hyperspace.
-Yes, sir.

12:07.790 --> 12:11.320
I guess I can assume
that any kind of trial will be rigged?

12:12.790 --> 12:15.520
Honestly, we'll be lucky to get that far.

12:15.960 --> 12:20.370
President Nadal has been paranoid about
Caledonian spies for some time now.

12:21.270 --> 12:22.900
Because I betrayed him this way,

12:23.500 --> 12:26.000
he may assume
I'm also part of that network.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.230
Great.

12:27.510 --> 12:30.100
Don't suppose your country
has any laws against torture?

12:30.210 --> 12:31.200
No.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.980
I applaud your courage, Kane.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.610
Commander Pernaux, Dr. Jackson.
Dr. Jackson...

12:42.720 --> 12:43.710
Yeah, I got it.

12:43.820 --> 12:46.260
What I don't understand
is why you came back.

12:47.090 --> 12:49.220
Dr. Jackson and I thought
there were some things

12:49.330 --> 12:51.130
the Rand people needed to know.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.460
The only thing I need to know
are the names

12:53.570 --> 12:55.970
of those among us who are working
for the Caledonians.

12:56.070 --> 12:58.900
Just because I went to Earth for help
doesn't mean I've also given information

12:59.010 --> 13:00.800
to the Caledonians
or know who might have.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.670
Earth is responsible
for our current state of affairs.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.180
Turning to them
is an act of a desperate man, Kane.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.870
Kane turned to us in the hopes
of preventing you

13:07.980 --> 13:10.280
from making a catastrophic mistake.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.050
And the Priors are not telling you
everything about the Ori.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.950
You need to hear me out
before you use that weapon

13:15.060 --> 13:16.350
to wipe out the Caledonians.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.290
So, you admit
you sympathize with Caledonia?

13:20.330 --> 13:22.120
That's not what he's saying.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.960
How the next few days unfold
is entirely up to you.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.730
But until I find out
who else is working with you,

13:27.840 --> 13:30.930
I guarantee neither of you
will know a moment's peace.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.020
I have a signal
from Dr. Jackson's locator beacon.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.990
Beam him directly onto the bridge.

14:00.030 --> 14:02.630
I take it this means
things aren't going so well.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.900
Coupled with the fact
that we haven't heard from him

14:06.010 --> 14:07.270
since he left two days ago.

14:07.370 --> 14:10.070
-We have located the satellite.
-PENDERGAST: Lock on target.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.610
This will be perceived
as an act of aggression against Rand.

14:13.380 --> 14:16.470
We could be risking any chance
of negotiating for Daniel's safe return.

14:22.660 --> 14:25.180
-Commander?
-Mr. President?

14:25.660 --> 14:29.190
The satellite's sensors have detected
a ship closing on its position.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.060
Target has been acquired, sir.

14:32.170 --> 14:33.830
We got the satellite dead to rights.

14:33.930 --> 14:36.700
We can hail them
and ask for Dr. Jackson in exchange.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.970
That would not accomplish the goal
of this mission.

14:40.070 --> 14:43.530
Jackson knew it might come to this.
He told us to proceed no matter what.

14:43.640 --> 14:44.940
He wouldn't want us to trade his life

14:45.050 --> 14:47.810
for thousands,
possibly millions, of Caledonians.

14:47.920 --> 14:48.940
Well, it's your call, Colonels.

14:49.050 --> 14:51.210
All I'm asking
is that you make up your mind quickly.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.340
Sir, we're detecting a power buildup
from within the satellite.

14:56.860 --> 14:58.380
Its attitude is changing.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.960
-We're being targeted.
-Sound general quarters.

15:03.060 --> 15:04.890
Full power to the forward
shield generators

15:05.000 --> 15:06.730
and maintain course and speed.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.030
(ALARM BLARING)

15:14.110 --> 15:15.600
-Do it.
-Fire.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.070
Firing missiles.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.710
Missiles detonated prior to impact.
Target remains intact, sir.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.490
It looks like it's being protected
by a shield.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.620
Defensive capabilities
must have been added.

15:33.830 --> 15:35.960
Okay, now what?

15:40.300 --> 15:43.670
-Shields are holding.
-Recommend firing a warning shot.

15:44.140 --> 15:47.570
We have been attacked, Commander.
We must respond in kind.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.010
Target the ship.

15:53.710 --> 15:56.410
The Earth vessel has been targeted.
Weapons primed and ready.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.010
Fire.

16:04.790 --> 16:06.730
PENDERGAST: Evasive maneuvers.
Full military thrust!

16:06.830 --> 16:08.660
Return fire. Forward rail guns.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.890
-Sublight engines aren't responding!
-Weapons are down.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.730
We've lost hull integrity and
life-support on decks three through seven.

16:13.830 --> 16:14.820
Seal them off!

16:14.940 --> 16:16.900
That blast cut through our shields
at full strength.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.530
I know. I don't understand how.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.440
Sensors detect
that the weapon is recharging.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.700
We've only got minutes.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.940
-Hyperdrive status?
-Hyperdrive is offline.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.740
Hull integrity is too unstable.

16:26.850 --> 16:30.080
Medical teams reporting four casualties.
Eight crew members still unaccounted for.

16:30.180 --> 16:32.450
That thing can only fire at one target
at a time.

16:32.550 --> 16:34.210
Go, scramble Blue Squadron.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.610
We'll see if we can do some damage
in close.

16:38.090 --> 16:39.250
Go, go!

16:48.770 --> 16:51.800
Tracking multiple smaller ships
attacking the satellite.

16:52.310 --> 16:55.500
-The shield is holding.
-By the grace of the gods.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.140
Thirty seconds till weapon
is primed and ready.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.010
Target the large vessel again.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.390
MAN ON RADIO: It's no use, BIue Leader.
We're not getting through.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.020
Keep at it, boys.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.770
Lieutenant, I need sublight engines now.

17:26.870 --> 17:30.610
I'm trying, sir.
Auxiliary systems aren't kicking in.

17:30.980 --> 17:33.380
They can't. The two main power relays
have been damaged.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.180
Can it be repaired?

17:35.280 --> 17:38.340
We need to reroute power
through the bypass conduits.

17:38.590 --> 17:39.640
Here.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.520
We should get limited
sublight capability back.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.450
Marks, you're with Colonel Carter. Go.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.150
MAN ON RADIO:
Come again on that Iast order.

17:45.530 --> 17:46.690
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

17:47.830 --> 17:50.300
WOMAN: Right away, sir.
MAN: We gotta put out these fires.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.390
We need to get up two levels.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.400
Captain, the elevator's not safe.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.640
Right. Sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.940
-The shields?
-Forward shields at 40%.

18:06.050 --> 18:08.010
Divert all shield power
to forward generators.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.880
Sir, sensors indicate that
the weapon is reaching maximum power.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.220
All hands, brace for impact!

18:14.420 --> 18:16.910
This damn thing's shield is not weakening.

18:25.000 --> 18:25.970
(GRUNTS)

18:34.940 --> 18:36.240
I got you.

18:36.340 --> 18:37.400
Come out of there.

18:39.310 --> 18:40.300
MAN 1 : Following through.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.570
MAN ON RADIO: No, we got
fires in all units.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.650
MAN: Put them out.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.280
-Are you all right?
-My arm.

18:47.350 --> 18:48.480
Bridge, this is Carter.

18:48.590 --> 18:51.460
Can you beam us up
to Auxiliary Control Room 2?

18:51.560 --> 18:54.430
Negative, Colonel, Control Room
no longer has life-support.

18:56.700 --> 19:01.130
The large vessel appears to be disabled.
Shall I broadcast a call for surrender?

19:01.240 --> 19:04.260
The Book of Origin tells us
that enemies of the Ori

19:04.370 --> 19:08.330
show no mercy in their attempts
to draw us away from the path.

19:08.580 --> 19:12.670
We must face this attack
with all the strength we have been given.

19:13.350 --> 19:14.940
Finish them.

19:18.450 --> 19:21.680
Prometheus, this is Blue Leader.
Request status report.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.420
Not too good right now, Blue Leader.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.060
-MITCHELL: Can we assist?
-Negative, Blue Leader, negative.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.390
Docking bays are too unstable
for safe return.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.860
-PENDERGAST: Stand by for orders.
-Roger that.

19:32.570 --> 19:36.000
CARTER: Bridge, this is Carter.
We need Deck 15 unsealed.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.900
Unseal it, if you can.

19:40.910 --> 19:43.040
If the aft power control panel is still intact,

19:43.140 --> 19:45.010
we should be able to rig
the naquadah generator

19:45.110 --> 19:47.550
and reroute power to sublight propulsion.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.340
PENDERGAST: You got about
two minutes, Colonel.

19:49.450 --> 19:50.970
It's not enough time, sir.

19:52.690 --> 19:53.680
WOMAN: I'm not getting anything!

19:53.790 --> 19:55.380
Open a channel,
broadcast on all frequencies.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.550
Yes, sir.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.930
This is Colonel Lionel Pendergast
of the Earth vessel Prometheus

20:00.030 --> 20:01.520
calling the Rand Protectorate.

20:01.630 --> 20:04.390
Your attack on our vessel
has severely damaged our engines

20:04.500 --> 20:07.060
and rendered
our weapons systems inoperable.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.000
We are willing to negotiate
the terms of our surrender.

20:12.340 --> 20:15.070
PENDERGAST: Rand Protectorate,
this is the Earth vesselPrometheus.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.900
We wish to negotiate our surrender.

20:17.010 --> 20:20.040
Repeat, we wish
to negotiate our surrender.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.720
-Okay, fire it up.
-Don't we need to test the power flow?

20:25.820 --> 20:27.150
-No time.
-But...

20:27.250 --> 20:28.740
I know. Do it.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.020
All right, this is useless.

20:36.130 --> 20:38.890
Blue Squadron, this is Blue Leader.
Break off the attack,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.830
and scramble formation between
the Prometheus and the weapon.

20:42.570 --> 20:45.400
Maybe one of us will get lucky
and take a portion of the next shot.

20:45.570 --> 20:47.770
I would not consider that lucky,
Colonel Mitchell.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.310
Well, it could be
for anybody aboard Prometheus.

20:53.810 --> 20:56.310
NADAL: President Nadal
of the Rand Protectorate

20:56.420 --> 20:58.010
addressing the Earth vessel.

20:58.990 --> 21:02.050
PIease explain your brazen act
of aggression against our nation.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.990
PENDERGAST: Our actions ha ve been
misconstrued as hostile.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.820
We are here to investigate
why an emissary we sent to your planet,

21:09.930 --> 21:12.690
Dr. Daniel Jackson,
has ceased all communications with us.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.700
And yet your first act
upon entering our planet's space

21:15.800 --> 21:18.000
was to fire on our defense satellite.

21:18.540 --> 21:22.100
But we detected that your satellite
was powering up and aiming at us,

21:22.210 --> 21:24.270
which we took
to be the first act of aggression.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.540
We merely responded in kind.

21:26.810 --> 21:30.870
Now we are no Ionger a threat to you.

21:31.350 --> 21:34.320
I have people aboard this vessel
who are in need ofmedical attention,

21:34.420 --> 21:36.510
and I am venting atmosphere.

21:37.360 --> 21:40.920
Please consider our request for surrender.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.300
Keep your fingers crossed.

21:48.300 --> 21:51.430
Your planet sent this ship to attack us.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.940
I have no desire to take more lives.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.740
You tell us what we want to know,
I will accept their surrender.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.140
Who else was involved in this attack?

22:01.420 --> 22:03.510
What other actions
are the Caledonians planning?

22:03.620 --> 22:06.350
JACKSON: We're not spies.
I came here to convince your people

22:06.450 --> 22:09.220
to dismantle this weapon yourselves
before any of this became necessary.

22:09.320 --> 22:13.050
-NADAL: Why would we do that?
-I have tried to explain.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.220
Who helped you
gain access to the stargate?

22:15.330 --> 22:16.390
I acted alone.

22:16.500 --> 22:20.960
You are lying.
You are part of a spy network

22:21.070 --> 22:24.160
helping to supply the Caledonians
with classified information.

22:24.270 --> 22:25.640
Did you ever think
that maybe the Caledonians

22:25.740 --> 22:27.800
are being leaked information
because not everyone in your country

22:27.910 --> 22:28.900
agrees with what you're doing?

22:29.010 --> 22:31.100
-MAN: The weapon is charged.
-Wait, please!

22:31.210 --> 22:34.670
Just listen to me before you go
murdering defenseless people.

22:34.780 --> 22:38.840
We are the ones defending ourselves.
Your ship attacked us.

22:40.820 --> 22:43.310
Sensors detect
the weapon is fully charged.

22:43.690 --> 22:47.150
-Colonel Carter, I need good news now.
-CARTER: A couple ofmore minutes.

22:47.260 --> 22:51.030
We don't have it, Sam. I'm sorry, it's over.
Give me as much power as you can.

22:51.130 --> 22:52.290
Reroute it from the shields

22:52.400 --> 22:55.390
and give me all functioning
internal Asgard beam sensors back online.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.370
-Sir?
-We're abandoning ship.

22:58.340 --> 22:59.570
Begin the evacuation orders.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.540
I want all personnel
to beam down to the planet surface.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.970
Find me a nice open field
anywhere in Caledonia.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.170
Yes, sir.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.910
Broadcast the locations
of all the active sensor sites.

23:08.020 --> 23:12.010
This is the Prometheus to all F-302s.
We have begun our evacuation.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.980
PENDERGAST: I advise you get clear
of the ship and meet us

23:14.090 --> 23:16.250
at the rendezvous coordinates
on the planet.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.290
Affirmative, Prometheus.

23:21.230 --> 23:22.290
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

23:23.400 --> 23:25.920
I'll handle
all the final transport commands.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.370
Everyone else is to report
to the nearest beam-out site.

23:28.470 --> 23:29.560
WOMAN: No, I've got nothing!

23:29.940 --> 23:32.000
Let's go, people. That's an order. Move!

23:32.110 --> 23:34.600

-Get out of here. Get out of here.

23:36.910 --> 23:38.430

23:42.680 --> 23:44.580
Go. If I don't finish tying this in

23:44.690 --> 23:47.880
we'll run out of power
before everyone can be beamed off.

23:48.960 --> 23:49.920
Go.

24:01.940 --> 24:05.390
We must not fail the gods.
We must embrace our destiny.

24:05.840 --> 24:06.810
Fire the weapon.

24:06.910 --> 24:08.140
-Wait!
-No!

24:08.940 --> 24:10.470
(ALARM WAILING)

24:41.910 --> 24:43.140
Oh, hell.

24:54.690 --> 24:57.160
The Earth vessel has been destroyed.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.840
The loss of your people is regrettable,

25:21.310 --> 25:24.410
but your planet and the Caledonians
must know our resolve.

25:24.520 --> 25:28.750
You know full well the Caledonians would
rather sacrifice themselves than submit.

25:31.320 --> 25:33.820
You'll be forced to commit genocide
and destroy them.

25:33.930 --> 25:36.520
A year ago, they launched
a first strike against us.

25:36.630 --> 25:39.120
They obviously had no problem
with doing the same.

25:39.230 --> 25:40.860
When does it stop?

25:41.570 --> 25:44.540
When do we stop killing each other
over wars started by our fathers

25:44.640 --> 25:46.540
and their fathers before them?

25:47.470 --> 25:49.940
This is no longer about Rand or Caledonia.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.200
It is.

25:51.480 --> 25:55.440
We need to set aside our differences
and fight the threat of the Ori together.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.280
Goran, how long
have we known each other?

26:00.620 --> 26:04.060
Please believe what Dr. Jackson
has told you about them.

26:07.730 --> 26:11.420
With my own eyes
I saw the Prior bring the satellite to life

26:11.530 --> 26:14.020
merely by touching it with his staff.

26:14.430 --> 26:16.660
Neither Rand nor Caledonia
have the technology

26:16.770 --> 26:19.240
capable of resisting such power.

26:19.610 --> 26:22.170
-What choice do we have?
-Look,

26:24.610 --> 26:25.810
I can't make you any promises,

26:25.950 --> 26:29.810
but we have already developed a machine
that neutralizes the Priors' powers.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.750
Now, as far as we know,
they've only been able to travel

26:31.850 --> 26:34.650
within our galaxy by use of the stargate,
and you can either bury your gate,

26:34.750 --> 26:37.220
or we can teach you to build
an iris system like ours.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.760
Nadal has lost all sense of reason.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.090
The Book of Origin, it's just one big lie

26:43.200 --> 26:45.930
meant to seduce us
into meaningless worship.

26:46.130 --> 26:48.620
The Ori just wanna use us.

26:48.940 --> 26:51.600
And killing in their name
is not self-defense.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.000
It's murder.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.740
CHASKA: We were monitoring
the entire exchange.

27:05.190 --> 27:09.210
To our knowledge, 76 crew were recovered
in Caledonian territory.

27:09.390 --> 27:12.260
MlTCHELL: There were over 1 15 people
aboard that ship.

27:13.030 --> 27:15.690
Do you have any sort of a manifest,
a list of names we can compare

27:15.800 --> 27:19.060
-to those recovered?
-Not on me, no.

27:19.770 --> 27:23.530
-So, where are our people?
-The transport arrived moments ago.

27:24.740 --> 27:27.000
-Teal'c, Cameron.
-Sam.

27:27.870 --> 27:30.070
You are a sight for sore eyes.

27:33.180 --> 27:37.120
It is good to see you alive, Colonel Carter.
We feared the worst.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.250
-MlTCHELL: Where's Pendergast?
-He wasn't with us.

27:42.860 --> 27:45.050
CHASKA: Our security forces
did extensive sweeps

27:45.160 --> 27:46.960
of the area where you appeared.

27:47.530 --> 27:49.120
No other survivors were found.

27:52.430 --> 27:56.530
This is Minister Chaska,
leader of the Caledonian Federation.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.670
I'm thankful you survived
such a tragic event, Colonel.

27:59.770 --> 28:02.470
I hope we can offer you and your crew
some comfort here.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.940
She's pretty much up to speed
on what's going on.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.980
We were, of course,
praying for your success,

28:08.080 --> 28:12.420
but with the destruction of your vessel,
I fear that any hope for a peaceful solution

28:12.520 --> 28:14.350
to this crisis has been lost.

28:14.690 --> 28:16.660
And you will not surrender?

28:16.860 --> 28:20.290
Our people would rather die
than live under Rand rule.

28:20.960 --> 28:25.490
We will retaliate against any attack
with the full forces at our disposal.

28:31.770 --> 28:33.330
CARTER: Any word?
MlTCHELL: Nothing.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.630
TEAL'C: The Rand government
continues to deny any knowledge

28:35.740 --> 28:37.230
of Daniel Jackson's existence.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.040
Our contacts tell us he was seen alive
in the Rand command bunker

28:40.150 --> 28:43.710
during the exchange with your ship.
He's not been seen since.

28:44.680 --> 28:45.980
Any progress here?

28:46.220 --> 28:48.240
Well, these satellite schematics
are far more detailed

28:48.360 --> 28:50.020
than the ones Kane provided.

28:50.120 --> 28:53.820
As we saw firsthand, shields were added
late in the design process.

28:53.930 --> 28:57.450
I'm still not sure what's powering it
or how it was able to penetrate

28:57.560 --> 29:01.090
our Asgard design shields,
but there is one bit of good news.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.570
According to this,
all commands for the satellite

29:04.670 --> 29:07.230
originate from Rand's main control facility,

29:07.340 --> 29:09.070
and maintaining a shield
around the satellite

29:09.180 --> 29:12.770
is a huge power drain, so it's
only activated when a threat is detected.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.180
Are you saying
the Prometheus was destroyed

29:15.280 --> 29:17.940
because we hesitated to fire
when we dropped out of hyperspace?

29:18.050 --> 29:21.040
We hesitated out of concern
for the safe return of Daniel Jackson.

29:21.150 --> 29:24.120
We also hesitated to leave
once our weapons were ineffective.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.450
However, it seems that you are saying
if we were to destroy

29:26.560 --> 29:30.890
the Rand control facility, the weapon itself
would become vulnerable to attack.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.590
Then we could take a 302 back up there
and finish the job.

29:33.700 --> 29:37.260
No, the Rand facility is part
of an underground bunker complex

29:37.370 --> 29:40.500
that was strong enough to survive
our last missile attack.

29:40.610 --> 29:43.940
Since then, Rand has developed
an early-warning radar system

29:44.080 --> 29:46.770
-and antimissile defenses.
-Wait up.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.540
What about sabotage?
You said you had people on the inside.

29:49.650 --> 29:52.450
Our agents have already
made several attempts.

29:52.550 --> 29:55.680
Security is too tight for them
to mount any sort of effective strike.

29:55.790 --> 30:00.250
Actually, we don't have to hit the bunker
itself to knock out satellite control.

30:01.290 --> 30:04.130
If we can sever the link
between the facility and the weapon,

30:04.230 --> 30:05.790
even temporarily.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.590
You're talking about an EM pulse.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.300
Even a small one detonated
in the atmosphere above the facility

30:10.400 --> 30:13.170
should interfere with their ability
to control the satellite.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.430
EM pulse?

30:14.540 --> 30:17.510
It would disable their electronic devices.
They'd be totally blind.

30:17.610 --> 30:20.670
-For a short time.
-You possess such technology?

30:23.050 --> 30:25.920
You wouldn't have suggested it
if you didn't have something in mind.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.850
Well, like most discoveries,
it was a bit of an accident.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.290
After the battle with Anubis' fleet
over Antarctica,

30:31.390 --> 30:35.350
small, random EM fields were detected
by Prometheus during the cleanup.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.090
Took us a while to figure out.

30:37.300 --> 30:42.960
Are you gonna tell me that an F-302
gives off an EM pulse when it blows up?

30:43.070 --> 30:46.100
It was one of the things
I was working on at Area 51.

30:46.210 --> 30:48.470
We think it has something to do
with a concussive force

30:48.580 --> 30:52.070
interfering with the artificial gravity field
generated by the inertial dampers.

30:52.180 --> 30:56.010
So, how do we remote fly
a 302 over there and blow it up?

30:56.250 --> 30:59.710
We don't have to. All we have to do
is harvest the inertial dampener

30:59.820 --> 31:01.720
and rig it
to one of the Caledonian missiles.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.880
What about the antimissile defenses?

31:04.060 --> 31:07.080
We use that same
302's radar-jamming technology

31:07.190 --> 31:09.350
to make your missile invisible to Rand.

31:09.460 --> 31:11.900
Still, if this does not work
as you're planning,

31:12.000 --> 31:14.560
it will be seen as an offensive
against Rand.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.300
President Nadal will surely respond
by stepping up the deadline

31:18.400 --> 31:21.740
for our surrender, and he'll use
the satellite weapon against us.

31:24.640 --> 31:25.670
This will work.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.950
I don't know what to say.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.750
How to take it all back.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.390
I shouldn't have come to you.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.930
Look, right now I just have to believe
there are survivors.

31:46.030 --> 31:49.930
-Do you think that's really possible?
-The Prometheus has beaming technology.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.060
Had beaming technology, whatever that is.

31:53.770 --> 31:55.260
Look, the bottom line is
we can't lose focus

31:55.380 --> 31:57.900
of why we came back here
in the first place.

31:58.010 --> 31:59.950
I mean, there has to be a way out of this,

32:00.050 --> 32:01.840
and I got the feeling
Pernaux was listening to us.

32:01.950 --> 32:03.280
-Daniel...
-Look, I know

32:03.380 --> 32:06.410
the history between Caledonia and Rand
makes things seem impossible,

32:06.520 --> 32:08.710
but sometimes
an outside perspective helps.

32:09.460 --> 32:12.120
In the past, I've found
the key to these types of disputes

32:12.230 --> 32:14.460
is to get both parties on equal footing,

32:14.560 --> 32:16.930
just to get the process
of talking with each other going again.

32:17.030 --> 32:19.900
-Do you ever give up?
-Not until I'm dead.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.290
And sometimes not even then.

32:26.270 --> 32:28.260
Intelligence is reporting
visual confirmation

32:28.370 --> 32:30.270
of a missile launch from Caledonia.

32:31.180 --> 32:34.410
Early-warning systems detect
no missile entering our airspace.

32:34.650 --> 32:36.670
-One missile?
-So it seems.

32:36.780 --> 32:40.510
-Possibly a test, then.
-They're not going to surrender.

32:40.790 --> 32:43.950
They are preparing to launch
a preemptive first strike,

32:44.060 --> 32:46.420
given the Earth's attack
on our satellite has failed.

32:46.530 --> 32:49.930
You don't know that.
They still have two days until the deadline.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.060
Get me Minister Chaska.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.700
President Nadal is online for you, ma'am.

33:00.510 --> 33:02.840
It doesn't look like
they've employed countermeasures.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.680
-Radar jamming is working.
-The timing is too coincidental.

33:06.780 --> 33:09.680
I suspect he has spies
who witnessed the launch.

33:09.780 --> 33:14.310
You'll need to stall, or else they'll activate
the satellite shield out of sheer paranoia.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.350
Patch him through.

33:21.030 --> 33:23.090
President Nadal, this is Minister Chaska.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.170
Mr. President, if you're calling
about the recent missile launch,

33:26.270 --> 33:29.060
please forgive me,
I should have called you immediately.

33:29.370 --> 33:31.130
CHASKA: The Iaunch was
entirely accidental.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.800
It seems there was some confusion

33:32.910 --> 33:35.640
when new Iaunch protocol codes
were distributed recently.

33:36.380 --> 33:39.540
Obviously, the payload was detonated
as soon as we realized

33:39.650 --> 33:41.270
what had happened.

33:42.020 --> 33:46.320
Needless to say,
everyone here is a little on edge as of late,

33:46.620 --> 33:48.880
but thankfully we have
ample precautions in place

33:48.990 --> 33:51.350
to prevent such an occurrence
from being a serious threat.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.920
NADAL: Indeed.

33:53.830 --> 33:58.130
Minister Chaska, while your military's
incompetence does concern me,

33:58.230 --> 34:02.500
the reason I am calling
is to discuss the impending deadline.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.630
I see.

34:06.010 --> 34:09.570
Our government is still in the process
of debating its options.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.180
As promised, we will give you an answer
by the designated deadline.

34:14.780 --> 34:17.750
I'm sorry the decision
has not been easier for you.

34:18.720 --> 34:20.710
We shall talk again soon.

34:24.120 --> 34:27.520
Air Command, this is Blue Leader.
We are wheels up.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.190
CARTER: Roger that. Package is on its way.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.700
We are 30 seconds
from detonation over target.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.230
Nice job.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.960
He didn't believe a word of it.

34:40.570 --> 34:43.910
Getting a report from coastal monitoring,
Base 4.

34:44.010 --> 34:46.140
May be visual of an incoming missile.

34:46.610 --> 34:48.340
Why isn't it showing up on our radar?

34:48.450 --> 34:52.040
Sir, satellite sensors are detecting
a single small ship on approach.

34:52.150 --> 34:55.480
Possibly one of the Earth fighters
that landed in Caledonia.

34:55.660 --> 34:57.450
Activate the missile shields.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.890
-NADAL: What just happened?
-I don't know. We've lost power.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.990
-All systems are down.
-Backup power is supposed to be isolated.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.440
The systems that activate it are down.

35:13.770 --> 35:16.370
-We can't control the satellite.
-Well, get it back.

35:16.480 --> 35:19.240
Get me a radio
and a phone in here that works!

35:25.790 --> 35:28.250
Blue Leader, this is base.
Package has been delivered.

35:28.350 --> 35:31.220
-Window of opportunity is now open.
-MITCHELL: Roger that.

35:31.620 --> 35:34.790
We have cleared the atmosphere
two minutes from weapons range.

35:34.890 --> 35:37.950
MAN: The blast did no apparent damage
beyond the power outage,

35:38.060 --> 35:42.130
which seems to be Iimited to the area
immediately around the command facility.

35:43.700 --> 35:45.000
To our knowledge,

35:45.100 --> 35:49.560
the Caledonians do not possess
the level of technology required to do this.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.740
Such a weapon could only have been
given to them by your people.

35:52.850 --> 35:55.510
-I hope so.
-How can we undo this?

35:55.880 --> 35:58.210
You tell me now, or I'll have you executed.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.780
Based on its speed and trajectory,

35:59.890 --> 36:02.250
the Earth ship will reach
the satellite in less than one minute.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.790
Do you think if the Ori were true gods

36:03.890 --> 36:05.950
they would allow the Caledonians
to do this?

36:06.060 --> 36:08.930
Look, I understand your fear of the Prior
and why you feel you have no choice,

36:09.030 --> 36:11.260
but there is another way out of this.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.790
-What would you have me do?
-Let me use the radio.

36:14.900 --> 36:16.960
I can contact the ship
that's about to destroy the satellite

36:17.070 --> 36:19.440
-and get them to call it off.
-Why would you do this?

36:19.540 --> 36:23.340
Because I still believe a peaceful
compromise can be reached out of all this.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.530
I'm listening.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.640
This is Daniel Jackson. Come in, please.

36:30.650 --> 36:33.680
To whoever's flying the 302,
if you can hear me, please respond.

36:33.790 --> 36:35.750
This is Daniel Jackson. Come in, please.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.580
Jackson, go ahead.

36:37.690 --> 36:40.250
-Mitchell?
-Yeah, you okay?

36:41.030 --> 36:44.020
-For the moment. You?
-Well, all things considered.

36:44.160 --> 36:48.830
Listen, me and Teal'c are getting ready
to bag ourselves an evil Ori satellite.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.930
Yeah, so glad I caught you.

36:51.040 --> 36:54.400
Listen, the Rand wanna offer
the Caledonians a deal.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.000
Really?

36:56.440 --> 36:57.930
-May l?
-Please.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.310
Daniel, this is Sam.

37:00.480 --> 37:03.240
-Hey, Sam, good to hear your voice.
-Yours, too.

37:03.650 --> 37:06.710
I'm here with Minister Chaska
of the Caledonian Federation.

37:06.820 --> 37:08.450
We'd like to know what Rand is offering.

37:08.550 --> 37:13.420
In exchange for Ieaving the satellite intact,
Rand is offering Caledonia the stargate.

37:14.890 --> 37:17.260
Rand is offering the gate
and a limited cease-fire,

37:17.360 --> 37:19.920
so all those from Caledonia
who do not want to follow Origin

37:20.030 --> 37:22.970
and wish to seek refuge on another planet
may do so.

37:23.070 --> 37:25.590
They want us to leave our home,
our planet.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.330
MITCHELL: Jackson,
are you sure about this?

37:27.870 --> 37:31.110
I got a clean shot at this thing,
and I am in favor of taking it.

37:31.210 --> 37:33.010
JACKSON: Listen, Rand built the satellite
in Iess than a year,

37:33.110 --> 37:36.600
and I can tell you
their resolve is pretty steady.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.280
If we blow this one up,
they're just gonna build another.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.780
As far as the Caledonians go, well,

37:41.890 --> 37:43.290
Sam, you're just gonna
have to explain to them

37:43.390 --> 37:44.980
that the Priors may not give them
much choice,

37:45.090 --> 37:46.990
regardless of what Rand decides to do.

37:47.090 --> 37:50.390
I've seen the Priors wipe out entire planets
for refusing to follow the Ori.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.330
You will not fight them with us?

37:52.470 --> 37:55.330
Well, we would try, but honestly,
there's only so much we can do.

37:55.430 --> 37:57.830
Will the Prior not follow us
wherever we go?

37:57.940 --> 37:59.230
Maybe, but for now...

37:59.340 --> 38:01.430
JACKSON: Look, this offer's not gonna be
on the table Iong,

38:01.540 --> 38:04.340
and I realize there's a lot
to be worked out, but at least it's a start.

38:05.850 --> 38:08.310
At the very least, the Rand now believe
that you have the ability

38:08.410 --> 38:10.470
to disable the satellite
whenever you want.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.070
Which they will surely counter, in time.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.690
Tell Colonel Mitchell to call it off.

38:33.840 --> 38:35.530
Blue Leader, this is Carter.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.630
Minister Chaska is requesting
that you stand down.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.710
All right, Jackson,

38:40.910 --> 38:43.880
but you folks better be
damn sure about this.

38:57.760 --> 39:02.170
Backup power is online.
Satellite control has been reestablished.

39:03.070 --> 39:06.660
Sensors detect the Earth ship
is veering away from the target.

39:08.570 --> 39:12.340
-Activate the shields.
-The ship is no longer a threat.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.110
-Power the weapon.
-What?

39:14.850 --> 39:18.340
-Target the Caledonian capitol building.
-MAN: Shields activated.

39:18.450 --> 39:21.150
-Sir, perhaps we should take a moment.
-You'll abide by my authority.

39:21.250 --> 39:23.720
-Power the weapon now.
-Powering the weapon.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.820
Our sensors detect that the weapon's
shields have become active.

39:28.830 --> 39:31.190
Jackson, what's going on down there?

39:31.530 --> 39:35.300
The satellite is powering up
its weapon and targeting the planet.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.230
We had a deal.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.130
President Nadal,
explain your actions immediately.

39:40.810 --> 39:42.500
President Nadal!

39:43.280 --> 39:44.970
You gave your word!

39:45.780 --> 39:49.210
I gave my soul to the Ori,
who offered us all salvation.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.480
Anyone who rejects that is a fool!

39:51.580 --> 39:54.380
They're all Caledonians, for God's sake.
They all deserved to die

39:54.490 --> 39:57.050
Iong before the Prior showed us
the path to enlightenment.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.150
-Shut down the satellite.
-Don't listen to him.

39:59.260 --> 40:01.590
-Now!
-Arrest the commander!

40:01.690 --> 40:04.360
Stand down! I won't let you do this, Nadal.

40:04.460 --> 40:05.930
Do as I say!

40:07.170 --> 40:08.130
(GRUNTS)

40:17.180 --> 40:19.670
Put your weapons down. Now!

40:20.980 --> 40:23.470
Get a medical unit in here. Go! Go!

40:31.460 --> 40:33.360
Shut down the satellite.

40:34.330 --> 40:35.390
He's dead.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.530
You heard them. The President is dead.
Commander Pernaux is next in command.

40:38.630 --> 40:40.120
He's also the one who killed the President.

40:40.230 --> 40:43.460
The President violated
an international treaty.

40:43.570 --> 40:46.200
You wanna be the one responsible
for destroying a city full of people

40:46.310 --> 40:48.900
when this goes to tribunal?
Shut it down now!

40:50.440 --> 40:52.500
Hang on. Help's coming.

40:54.210 --> 40:56.650
The deal will stand.

41:15.970 --> 41:19.100
Hey. Haven't seen you
since the memorial service.

41:19.540 --> 41:20.600
Yeah.

41:22.510 --> 41:24.100
It was a rough day.

41:28.710 --> 41:30.410
So, where've you been?

41:31.850 --> 41:37.120
I hand-delivered Landry's letter
to Colonel Pendergast's wife and kids.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.380
They need to know
that he died saving his crew.

41:41.860 --> 41:43.450
That his death mattered.

41:46.200 --> 41:50.070
Well, 76 people survived.
That's a testament to his leadership.

41:50.640 --> 41:51.800
And yours.

41:52.770 --> 41:56.210
We never would have got off that planet
if you hadn't brokered the deal.

42:00.410 --> 42:04.370
-So, I take it then you haven't heard.
-Heard what?

42:06.350 --> 42:09.120
Soon after we left, the talks broke down.

42:12.930 --> 42:13.950
And?

42:14.060 --> 42:16.120
And we've been unable
to make contact with them.

42:16.230 --> 42:20.030
General Landry had the Daedalus
reroute on its way back from Atlantis.

42:20.470 --> 42:24.200
It seems the Caledonians weren't content
to just leave their fair planet.

42:24.700 --> 42:28.260
-They launched an attack?
-And Rand responded.

42:29.510 --> 42:32.170
The stargate is presumed buried
in the rubble.

42:38.520 --> 42:39.850
Rough day.

42:42.460 --> 42:43.790
Rough day.
