00:21.438 --> 00:24.482
Hey, gang, it's Surf Sam on KBLA.

00:24.692 --> 00:28.528
We're just hours away
from Halloween night, 1965.

00:28.696 --> 00:32.323
Oh, I see that the hangout for the
Hollywood Knights, Tubby's Drive-In,

00:32.491 --> 00:33.950
is coming down tonight.

00:34.118 --> 00:35.952
Fellas, don't get bummed out.
Remember:

00:36.120 --> 00:38.955
A friend with weed
is a friend indeed.

00:39.123 --> 00:41.082
3:29, Beach Boys time.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.775
Man, she saw it. That's great.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.706
Hey, what are you
doing over there?

01:21.874 --> 01:24.375
I'm doing Dr. Eisner's
new facial exercises.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.754
Oh, it's wonderful. It keeps your
skin circulating. It keeps you young.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.756
It's great.
It's a bear-lion. You go:

01:30.215 --> 01:33.217
Aah. Mmm. Aah.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.763
Doesn't that stretch your skin out?
Oh, no, it's circulation. It's great.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.765
It keeps you young
and youthful, gorgeous.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.600
I'm gonna tie my bathing suit
here to the chair.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.185
But I don't know why
you're doing that.

01:42.352 --> 01:46.939
You know, last time I did that, my tits got... They
peeled so much I went from a size B cup to an A.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.318
What's that clicking noise?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.736
You hear it.
It's a camera.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.404
Camera!
You little creep!

01:53.781 --> 01:56.824
What is that? What are you doing?
Camera! Camera!

01:57.743 --> 01:59.452
What are you, crazy?

02:01.497 --> 02:03.581
I'll sue you
for trespassing!

02:03.874 --> 02:08.002
Clark, we got a couple of party boys
here that love to scare old ladies.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.172
You don't have to work for
Scotland Yard to know about this.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.382
A potato?
This was in the tailpipe

02:13.550 --> 02:14.926
of the chief's car
last week.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.970
Get down!
Clark, look what we got here.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.056
Empty egg carton.
That tell you anything?

02:21.141 --> 02:23.935
You boys making omelets?
What are you laughing at, huh?

02:24.144 --> 02:27.730
You know what I'd like to do
to you now, Newbomb?

02:28.106 --> 02:30.900
I'd like to kick the crap out of you,
that's what I'd like to do!

02:31.068 --> 02:32.401
What's the problem, officer?

02:32.694 --> 02:35.530
Oh, we got it taken care of, sir.
Thank you very much. Everything's fine.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.031
No problem.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.699
Just got some punks out here,
and that's it.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.879
Wake up, Bimbeau. I want you
to get something straight.

02:52.047 --> 02:56.425
I don't need the captain all over my
butt about some rinky-dink drive-in.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.304
Do me a favor, Bimbeau.
Don't aggravate the situation.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.640
Everything's under control,
sarge. It's okey-dokey.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.726
Besides, sarge,
as a matter of fact,

03:06.061 --> 03:10.273
if any of those little assholes get out of
line, I'll personally kick the shit out of them.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.025
That's exactly what
we don't want, Bimbeau.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.027
The drive-in's coming down.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.029
They'll all be gone tomorrow.

03:17.239 --> 03:21.242
We don't need police brutality.
Got it?

03:21.952 --> 03:24.078
Hear that?
Right. Yeah.

03:24.288 --> 03:27.373
Bimbeau, what in
the hell is that?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.250
No, no. Here!

03:33.171 --> 03:35.506
Woo-hoo. Woo-hoo.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.385
Oh, not that house.
People have been bad there.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.721
Mooning!
Mooning!

03:41.930 --> 03:44.557
Mooning, Mr. Katzenberg.
Absolutely.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.476
We've all had these
disgusting experiences

03:47.644 --> 03:51.731
with these Hollywood Knights,
and I give you my word,

03:51.899 --> 03:54.483
tonight is the last night
the Hollywood Knights

03:54.651 --> 03:56.652
will ever be
in Beverly Hills again.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.447
Isn't that wonderful? Oh.

03:59.615 --> 04:02.992
I want to send my husband Jack's
apologies to all of you.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.077
He was real sorry
he couldn't be here tonight.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.705
Anyway, he'll be at the pep rally
later giving the awards,

04:07.873 --> 04:10.833
and of course, we'll see him
at the dance. Well...

04:11.043 --> 04:13.002
What's the song
he's got now? The, uh...

04:13.170 --> 04:15.129
"Tijuana Taxi."
With the horn honk,

04:15.297 --> 04:16.630
the "beep, beep"
at the end of it.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.591
What the hell is that
supposed to be?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.176
That's popular music.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.053
Where the hell is the story
in a "beep, beep"?

04:22.220 --> 04:23.554
Yeah.
Tell you what popular music is...

04:23.722 --> 04:25.222
I know what popular music is.
You don't know.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.682
I do.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.769
Starting tomorrow,
today will be history...

04:29.937 --> 04:31.437
Horseshit!

04:31.605 --> 04:35.024
Nevans, there's some distracting
noise in the kitchen.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.609
Could you see what that is?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.195
That's the Beverly Hills
Police Department.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.489
They're out there with Juanita.
Bullshit!

04:42.032 --> 04:43.574
Take care of it.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.744
I'll see if I can't
quiet those people down.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.330
Anyway, Tubby's Drive-In,

04:49.539 --> 04:52.083
this social disease
of our neighborhood,

04:52.250 --> 04:58.255
well, it's enjoying its last night
of residence in Beverly Hills.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.969
I knew you'd all be pleased
because all of our...

05:05.430 --> 05:09.141
Thank you.
And one year from today,

05:09.434 --> 05:10.768
this beautiful office complex

05:13.689 --> 05:18.359
Will be standing
in the old Tubby's Drive-In's place.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.946
I assure you that you
and none of the rest of you

05:22.114 --> 05:25.616
have to worry about
the Hollywood Knights any longer.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.827
We won't be hearing
from them again.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.290
Go, go, go!

05:44.261 --> 05:47.555
They're out of... Excuse me.
Juanita's busy. I'll get the door.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.098
It's fine.
No, really, I...

05:49.266 --> 05:52.435
Well, all right.
We'll both get it. Why not?

05:53.603 --> 05:55.980
I need you.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.776
Watch it. Stand back. Stand back.
Nevans!

06:00.944 --> 06:03.154
Get it! Get it out!

06:04.072 --> 06:08.200
It's dog shit!
It's dog shit all over you!

06:08.410 --> 06:10.369
Mrs. Friedman!

06:12.080 --> 06:14.331
I'll kill you!
I'll kill all of you!

06:14.499 --> 06:18.544
Shit. Shit.
Juanita! Juanita, get out here!

06:37.773 --> 06:39.523
They finally come.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.777
Nice to see you. Nice of you to make it.
Nice of you to come.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.779
Where is everybody?
Where is everybody?

06:44.946 --> 06:47.740
Hey, no problem. I spoke to Wheatly,
and he'll be here in a minute.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.408
Hey, I was talking to Red.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.244
He's pretty bent, man. They've
been here for about 21 years.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.622
Said he's been thinking about
moving to New Jersey.

06:55.082 --> 06:58.542
You know, this is compliments of
the Beverly Hills Asshole Association.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.673
Everybody showing up tonight. All the
flatheads forever are showing up tonight.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.718
Wheatly. Mr. Wheatly,
nice of you to join us tonight.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.637
How you guys doing?
What's going on?

07:09.805 --> 07:11.847
Hey, Wheatly, where you been?
I was kicking some ass.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.391
You were kicking ass?
He was kissing ass.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.186
Hey, listen,
we got all our cars here tonight. Except one.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.314
Yeah, Simpson, when you
gonna bring your rail job?

07:20.524 --> 07:22.108
I mean, this is
the last night.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.735
Where is this Flying Purple People
Eater you keep talking about?

07:24.903 --> 07:28.697
Relax, relax. I gotta wait till my old
man goes to sleep so I can wheel it out.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.451
Maybe you want me to follow you home.
You know, you might be a little bit nervous.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.245
Everybody is showing.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.206
You know, there is gonna be a ton
of lead sleds in the block tonight.

07:37.374 --> 07:41.127
Yeah, that's great. You know what? Everybody'll think
we're a bunch of '50s queers when they come in here.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.170
Hey, how long you got
your brother's car for?

07:43.338 --> 07:45.172
For as long as I like.
Yeah, sure.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.342
Hey, Newbomb, I saw your brother.
He's a monster.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.636
Do I look worried?
Do I appear worried?

07:58.937 --> 08:00.938
Bimbeau.
Bimbeau. Bimbeau.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.773
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
What?

08:02.941 --> 08:05.067
How do you think I'd look
in a mustache, huh?

08:05.235 --> 08:07.403
Think I'd be better-looking
than I am already?

08:07.571 --> 08:11.448
Perfect. Perfect jerk.
Good... Jerk? Good-looking.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.076
Just like the guys
we bust every night.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.744
No, that's perfect
for you.

08:16.705 --> 08:21.292
♪ Lawrence
Lawrence of Arabia ♪

08:21.459 --> 08:26.422
♪ He's an English guy
He came to fight the Turkish ♪♪

08:26.590 --> 08:29.425
Okay, Clark, right there.
That's what I'm talking about.

08:29.593 --> 08:33.386
"Lawrence of Arabia"
doesn't have any lyrics to it.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.014
Doesn't have any words.
What do you mean?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.640
It's music. It's music.

08:36.808 --> 08:40.852
Hey, I've seen the movie four times.
And there were no words to it.

08:41.104 --> 08:45.191
There are no words to that!
Did you hear what I was saying earlier?

08:45.358 --> 08:49.236
Somewhere, I know that somebody,
I think, wrote lyrics to this song.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.363
Horseshit. There are no words.
Horseshit?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.116
Horseshit. There are no words to it.
Hey, Bimbeau. Bimbeau. Bimbeau.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.160
Kiss my ass. All right?

08:56.828 --> 08:59.288
Do the fake mustache and mark off
another spot, and that'll be your ass.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.416
Hey, you want me to put an X on my ass?
You can find it that way.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.336
Pull over here. I gotta take a squirt.
Will you? Give me a break.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.881
Hey, these guys are lucky.
We're leaving them in Watts.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.592
Last year we left them
in a bad neighborhood.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.093
These guys are punks.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.597
When I got into the Knights, I had to climb
a greased pole and they put eggs up my butt.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.141
I know. You should suffer,
you know?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.310
Let's go, guys. Out, out, out.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.688
Everybody out.
It's initiation time. Let's go.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.233
Come on, man.
Let's go.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.694
This is not a party. You want a party?
Come back after initiation.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.239
Get against the car.
Out of sight.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.032
Okay, drop them.
What?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.910
Get your clothes off!
Strip, man! Let's go.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.038
You should be proud to be Knights.
Don't give me that look.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.458
You're lucky. We used to tar and feather
the pledges. You know what I mean?

09:45.669 --> 09:48.379
Wheatly, look at that.
That looks like a penis, only smaller.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.673
Hey, listen,
go in the back there.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.009
I want the tires out of the truck,
I want your clothes in.

09:54.177 --> 09:57.429
Tires out, I want the clothes in.
What are we gonna do with the tires?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.931
Here's the plan of action.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.184
I want to see you and the tires
back at Tubby's at 2:00.

10:02.352 --> 10:05.271
If you are not back by 2:00,
I do not want to see you back at all.

10:05.480 --> 10:09.108
Because at 2:00, gentlemen, I expect
to hear the dedication over the radio

10:09.276 --> 10:11.986
that you've delivered the message
to the DJ at the record store.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.822
Are we set there, gentlemen?
Are we ready? Very, very, very good.

10:14.990 --> 10:19.618
Gentlemen, goodbye, good luck.
And think of this as a great adventure.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.663
It's Halloween, jackoff.
Let's go, let's have some fun.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.543
Take off your shorts!

10:27.711 --> 10:30.379
Come on. Come on, man.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.924
Hey, guys, watch out for
a cougar with rabies!

10:36.386 --> 10:38.804
You mean they're gonna leave us
naked in Watts?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.889
Where's the record store?

10:41.099 --> 10:43.767
Hey, come on down
and see me, I am broadcasting live

10:43.935 --> 10:46.645
from Music City
in the heart of Watts tonight.

10:46.813 --> 10:50.232
Hey, guess who's coming in now.
It's time for Dr. J., all right.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.778
KBLA and Surf Sam getting up and
making way for who else but Dr. J.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.363
Thank you, my man, Surf Sam.

10:56.531 --> 11:00.534
Hey, Dr. J., KBLA,
Halloween night, 1965.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.328
The funkiest you have
ever heard.

11:02.579 --> 11:06.665
And I'm gonna hit you hard with
"Sherry" by The Four Seasons right now.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.085
What time is it?
Eight-thirty.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.504
Maybe the chicks aren't coming.
Hey, you guys, shut up!

11:15.300 --> 11:17.801
This is our secret spot.
Nobody knows about it.

11:17.969 --> 11:22.181
Now, will you stop worrying? We're alone.
Nobody knows we're here. I'm telling you.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.560
I can't believe we're doing this.
If my pop ever found out

11:26.728 --> 11:31.523
that I was changing into this outfit,
he would just die. He would die.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.942
My God. I can't believe...

11:34.110 --> 11:37.071
Don't forget to take
your bra off. You too.

11:37.238 --> 11:41.075
I read about a new bust exercise.
Really? Where?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.576
In the Vogue magazine.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.496
Especially from Europe.
I paid $6 for it.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.623
Ooh, does that feel good.
Freedom at last.

11:47.791 --> 11:51.043
You think I should wear a bra? I'd hate to
get caught without a bra in a car accident.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.628
Oh, is this exciting.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.839
My pants are too tight.
Take your underwear off.

11:56.007 --> 11:59.927
What's wrong with you? Just hurry up and
get changed before somebody does come.

12:00.095 --> 12:03.180
I'm ready. Come on.
We gotta hurry to the pep rally.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.848
Watch out!

12:05.225 --> 12:07.851
Oh, my God!
What are you doing there?

12:12.482 --> 12:16.610
Get out of here! What are you, crazy?
I don't believe it!

12:16.986 --> 12:19.696
Get out of here!
I can't stand you, Turk!

12:19.864 --> 12:22.908
You're so immature!
You're such a putz!

12:23.076 --> 12:27.246
Hey, that's real great. Here comes Bimbeau.
Get up, man! Here he comes, man.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.636
I wanna tell you buttholes
something.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.472
This shit is way
out of line.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.852
And you squirrels better have
some nuts in your mouth,

12:50.019 --> 12:51.437
or you're going downtown.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.870
What the hell's
the difference, huh?

13:08.037 --> 13:11.415
I gotta have a nighttime job
so I can be free during the day.

13:11.583 --> 13:15.127
Yeah, I almost forgot.
You're gonna be a famous actress.

13:16.129 --> 13:20.507
That's what pisses you off, isn't it?
That I might become somebody.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.678
I think you're somebody right now.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.056
Oh, shit, come on.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.062
Look, I gotta start looking
after tonight anyway.

13:34.439 --> 13:38.192
You know, I think you're right. You should go out and
find a job right away so you don't starve to death.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.860
What do you want me to do?

13:40.195 --> 13:44.072
You're gonna start college in January,
you got a part-time job here at Smitty's.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.284
Right. Hey, it's not my fault
you're a carhop.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.289
Do you think I like all them jerks making
wiseass cracks about my old lady all night?

13:52.499 --> 13:55.417
You don't like it? Look, I'm
the one that's gotta put up with it.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.632
Look, I gotta get in there.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.176
I'll talk to you later, okay?

14:14.562 --> 14:17.064
If I can't get off early,
are you gonna wait for me?

14:20.193 --> 14:23.153
I gotta tell Red.
I don't know.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.785
Shit.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.754
Hey, that's the car
James Dean drove, man.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.090
Bitchen.
He had two of these.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.552
Hey, man, these things handle real well.
You can take a corner outrageous.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.929
Probably gonna take
the coast road up too.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.472
All curvy, beautiful.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.893
It's a '57.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.021
Try using the handle, Clark.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.943
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.699
Okay, Wiener schnitzels.
Hey, hey, it's just a cop.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.660
Let's get these overpriced
sewing machines out of here!

15:11.828 --> 15:14.871
Just a cop that likes to bust balls.
What's that, Newbomb?

15:15.039 --> 15:16.915
I said, you guys stand tall.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.959
We stand tall.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.964
Okay... You can listen too.
I wanna tell you something.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.508
If I smell any
rubber tonight...

15:26.676 --> 15:30.220
Benedict Canyon,
anywhere around there.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.473
- Your ass is grass,

15:33.641 --> 15:35.142
and I'm the lawn mower.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.853
You got it? You punks got it?
You got that, boys?

15:38.021 --> 15:41.315
His ass. Okay?
Yes, sir. Yes, officer.

15:41.482 --> 15:44.192
Let's go.
Move it out!

15:46.112 --> 15:48.905
Come on, go.
Go! Go!

15:49.741 --> 15:51.867
I gotta take a squirt.
Good night, Officer Clark.

15:52.035 --> 15:55.078
Good night, Officer Lawn Mower.
Come on.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.080
Ooh! Ooh!

15:57.624 --> 15:59.625
Come on! Right here!

16:00.627 --> 16:03.420
Hey, Brenda, listen.
Hey, I enjoyed last night.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.714
Good God.

16:05.882 --> 16:11.136
No, it's okay. I'll have a Big One
and a Cherry Coke.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.513
Make it two Big Ones
and two Cherry Cokes.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.808
You want the Big One?
I've got the Big One.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.811
Oh, God, he is so gross!

16:20.021 --> 16:22.522
Hey, hey, hey,
you two girls want a thrill?

16:23.191 --> 16:25.692
I'm not paying any attention.
Hey, Iron Box,

16:25.860 --> 16:27.444
I'm talking to you
and your girlfriend.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.154
Very funny.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.865
Hey, have you ever heard
my version of that song?

16:32.575 --> 16:34.284
Oh, my God,
we have to get out of here.

16:34.452 --> 16:35.994
Why?
He's gonna fart the song.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.622
He's gonna what?
He's going to fart the song.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.123
You're gonna love it.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.417
Stay there.
Let me warm up.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.252
Hey, look,
there's that red Dodge!

16:46.714 --> 16:50.092
Hey, Jimbo.
What do you say, Jimmy?

16:50.343 --> 16:53.095
Hey, Jimmy, kind of cold
on that thing or what?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.889
Colder than a witch's tit.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.892
Ah, hey. Here.
What's this?

16:59.060 --> 17:02.521
Go on, keep it. You'll need something to
read on the bus. I'll pick up another one.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.440
Jimmy, you know, I was thinking,
if you have to go overseas, man,

17:05.608 --> 17:08.734
I'll collect all those magazines from
the guys and I'll send them over to you.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.279
Thanks.
I never thought of that.

17:11.446 --> 17:16.326
But I probably won't be going over to Vietnam.
The only people they're sending over is advisers.

17:16.493 --> 17:19.329
Hey, I thought last month,
when Dee Dee was late, I wouldn't be going.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.373
They ain't taking anybody
with babies.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.460
That's a tough break.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.797
You're gonna get
the experience of a lifetime.

17:30.091 --> 17:33.385
I remember the first time I ever saw
you two guys. Do you remember that?

17:33.553 --> 17:36.513
You came rolling that bicycle
in here with two flat tires

17:36.681 --> 17:38.932
and a broken chain
and the bent handlebars.

17:39.100 --> 17:43.186
I looked at you and said, "Get that
thing out of here. We fix cars."

17:43.688 --> 17:47.899
Yeah, fix cars. Thirty minutes later
it was fixed, and we were riding it.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.487
You know,
I can't believe it, man.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.865
You know there's only
four pledges this year?

17:55.032 --> 17:58.326
I remember when I was in junior high school,
everybody wanted to be a Knight.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.203
I just don't know
anymore, man.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.247
Everything changes.
Remember that.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.790
Nothing stays the same.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.670
I got it.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.757
Look, I'm telling you,
Barbara does not put out, okay?

18:11.924 --> 18:13.550
She do. She do.
No, she doesn't.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.720
She's a tramp. She's a tramp.
She do. She do.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.475
Shorty.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.733
Wheatly, that girl's looking at me.
What?

18:29.901 --> 18:31.693
That girl right there is looking at me.
What girl?

18:31.861 --> 18:34.070
That girl right there with the
red scarf. She's checking me out.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.491
Hey, look, she's not checking you out.
She's looking through you to get to me.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.659
Uh-uh, man, she's looking right at me.
Where?

18:39.827 --> 18:42.120
Right there with the red scarf on.
Hey, are you looking at him?

18:42.288 --> 18:44.247
He thinks you're looking at him.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.334
Man, you asshole!

18:47.502 --> 18:49.544
You just blew it for me!
I'm sorry.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.672
I can't believe you, Wheatly.
I can't believe you sometimes.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.175
God!
I'm sorry, all right?

18:55.343 --> 18:57.344
Don't get bent.
How's it going?

18:57.512 --> 19:00.597
Hey, watch the car, all right?
What are you talking about?

19:00.765 --> 19:02.432
Hey, listen, Moosie,
cut your hair, okay?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.434
I gotta go practice now.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.144
Hey, hey, hey,
you're into fine food.

19:06.312 --> 19:10.941
What do you get when you cross a
donkey with a slice of Bermuda onion?

19:11.734 --> 19:13.068
I don't know. What?

19:13.236 --> 19:16.071
A piece of ass
that brings tears to your eyes.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.455
You're boring, Turk.
You're very boring.

19:26.582 --> 19:30.043
This dork?
This dork is better, right?

19:30.211 --> 19:33.296
This dork, huh?
Hey, dork.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.884
Hey, hey, hey.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.719
Hey, butt breath.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.599
What the hell did I tell you
about your sidewalk surfing in public?

19:44.767 --> 19:46.893
Do you remember
that conversation?

19:47.061 --> 19:50.021
Huh? I told you to hang ten
in your neighborhood.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.858
What do you got in your pocket?
A pack of cigarettes.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.151
Pack of cigarettes. You're a minor.
What are you doing with them?

19:55.319 --> 19:57.153
They're for my mother.
Give them here.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.239
Come on, get them out.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.824
For his mother.
For your mother.

20:00.992 --> 20:04.369
You're lying to me, kid.
You're lying to a police officer.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.747
You little son of a bitch.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.834
You just remember what we said about
sidewalk surfing in public, all right?

20:11.294 --> 20:12.836
Now, take off.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.091
Hey, what's up, squirt?
"Surf City."

20:20.678 --> 20:22.888
Beaver patrol!
Beaver patrol!

20:23.055 --> 20:25.098
Calling all beavers!

20:26.809 --> 20:30.353
Dawn! Hey, Dawn!
You see these pictures?

20:31.022 --> 20:34.190
Dawn! I always thought
you were a natural blond.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.985
Shut up, you idiot! You idiots!

20:37.153 --> 20:40.280
Have you seen these pictures, Dark?
Dark, you gotta see these pictures of her.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.365
You know, that's so stupid, Turk!

20:42.533 --> 20:44.784
Keep the pictures.
I'll take the real thing.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.412
Hey, Dawn! Great tits!

20:57.506 --> 20:59.299
Newbomb,
that's your brother's car.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.551
You parked next to a fire hydrant.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.638
Big deal.
It's Halloween.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.724
Okay, fine. I'll see you guys
in the parking lot, all right?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.898
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.609
Thank you all.
It's a wonderful-looking crowd tonight.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.278
I'm glad to see you all
come out and support us this way.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.614
And we're gonna get
those Panthers, aren't we?

21:25.868 --> 21:29.287
Well, I'm looking forward to seeing
all of you over at the dance tonight,

21:29.455 --> 21:33.333
which is what I have to do right now, is go over
and take care of some last-minute details over there

21:33.501 --> 21:35.418
with the help of Mr. Nevans,

21:35.586 --> 21:40.173
so I'm gonna turn the evening over
to my husband, Mr. Jack Friedman,

21:42.718 --> 21:44.928
and our good friend
Mr. William Thornwell,

21:45.096 --> 21:47.097
who, of course,
we all know as Thorny.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.975
So I'll see you
over at the dance later.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.894
Thank you very much.
This is "Thorny" Thornwell.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.480
What a joy it is to be here

21:55.648 --> 22:00.694
at the very spot where I first dreamed
of becoming your Channel 9 weatherman.

22:01.195 --> 22:04.823
I've got a few announcements to make this
evening. We've got some real treats coming up.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.208
Hey, what are you doing, man?

22:15.331 --> 22:18.378
You look good, Newbomb.
Maybe you'll get a date.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.589
It's an improvement.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.144
Hey, Riding Hood,
wanna be eaten by the Big Bad Wolf?

22:34.311 --> 22:35.895
Fuck you, Newbomb.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.109
You told her, didn't you?
You told her, didn't you?

22:41.277 --> 22:43.737
You set me up, didn't you?
We didn't set you up.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.280
What time does
Dudley get here?

22:45.448 --> 22:47.782
Relax, he'll be here
in a few minutes, okay?

22:52.580 --> 22:54.414
Mother, please.
What is it?

22:54.582 --> 22:57.542
I have to practice that.
That's why I'm singing it.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.211
Yes, but your singing in no way
corresponds with my fingering.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.172
Oh, well.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.758
Now, you'll receive
the check at the rally.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.926
I know.
They just wanted you to come by

23:07.094 --> 23:08.636
and say "thank you"
in person.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.181
I know.
After all, $500

23:11.348 --> 23:13.516
covers a full year's tuition.

23:13.684 --> 23:15.310
Mother, I know!

23:15.478 --> 23:18.021
Yes. Now we're gonna stop
for a little cherry pie.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.564
No. I'm not hungry.

23:19.774 --> 23:22.025
Yeah, well, you need
a little quick energy.

23:23.277 --> 23:27.530
Mother, they always laugh at me at that
restaurant when I'm dressed like this.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.641
This is so crazy.
Oh, Nevans.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.144
And now it's my great pleasure
to introduce

23:58.312 --> 24:01.898
the president of the Beverly Hills
Residents' Association

24:02.066 --> 24:03.733
and a great American,

24:03.901 --> 24:05.777
Jack Friedman.

24:07.571 --> 24:11.116
Thank you, Thorny.
What's the weather like up there?

24:11.992 --> 24:14.577
Well, I'm sure we're all gonna
have a good time tonight.

24:14.745 --> 24:18.623
And I'm not going to make any long speeches.
I'm just going to, uh...

24:24.880 --> 24:26.840
All right.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.842
I'm just going to start off

24:29.009 --> 24:32.387
by introducing a wonderful
organization of fine young people.

24:32.555 --> 24:34.681
The Beverly
Marching Band!

25:08.174 --> 25:09.507
Get it up!

25:15.848 --> 25:19.017
Take it up! Where's
the security, goddamn it?

25:19.476 --> 25:21.603
Do the other thing.
The other thing?

25:21.770 --> 25:23.897
You know.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.398
Come here.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.692
The other thing?
Yeah.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.492
Heavens, Nevans!

25:38.913 --> 25:40.496
Mrs. Friedman?

25:42.082 --> 25:44.626
Mrs. Friedman.
Is that you?

25:44.793 --> 25:47.086
What are you doing
here alone?

25:47.254 --> 25:49.047
I had some thinking to do,
Dudley.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.926
It's fortuitous that I found you here
alone because I wanted to ask your advice

25:53.093 --> 25:56.054
on which magic trick I should
do for the talent contest.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.139
Oh, Dudley, I'm not a good
judge of magic tricks.

25:58.307 --> 26:02.018
I was thinking of doing my big illusion,
producing a rabbit from an empty box.

26:02.186 --> 26:04.562
Abracadabra,
and here it is.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.106
Oh, it's a cute little rabbit.
I call him Squeakums.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.816
I think the audience
will find him amusing.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.652
I think they will too.
Do that trick.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.780
Or else I could do...
They're waiting for you inside.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.823
This is called
my three-ball trick.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.743
You put these balls in between
your fingers, and you make a magic...

26:18.911 --> 26:20.411
Oh! Oh!

26:20.579 --> 26:22.038
I'm sorry.
That's all right.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.083
I'll get them.
They're down here somewhere.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.168
Oh, thank you very much.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.337
Mrs. Friedman,
what are these?

26:29.505 --> 26:31.506
Are these yours, Mrs. Friedman?
Yes, they're my husband's pants,

26:31.674 --> 26:33.591
and I'm taking them
to the cleaners.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.804
Then it's a lucky thing I dropped by because
I can feel a wallet and keys in the pocket.

26:37.972 --> 26:40.556
Dudley, put the pants down, please.
Yes, ma'am.

26:43.644 --> 26:45.853
Did I do that?
I'm sorry!

26:46.021 --> 26:48.356
Dudley, please leave!

26:48.524 --> 26:51.734
Please just leave! Thank you!

26:52.903 --> 26:54.320
The horn is stuck.
Jesus!

26:54.488 --> 26:56.364
The little son of a bitch.

26:58.617 --> 27:02.704
Excuse me, ladies, did you hear
about the guy with the five penises?

27:03.872 --> 27:05.206
His pants fit
like a glove.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.126
Oh, you piece of trash.
Disgusting.

27:09.378 --> 27:10.920
Great joke. Great joke.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.755
Turn that song up, man.
That's my favorite song.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.924
Wait a minute, man,
wait a minute.

27:15.509 --> 27:18.428
I want you guys to look at me,
all right? Who do I look like?

27:19.054 --> 27:20.388
I have no idea.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.308
Yeah? Look at me,
all right?

27:23.475 --> 27:26.227
I'm depressed.
Who do I look like?

27:26.395 --> 27:27.937
You look like that asshole
at the car wash.

27:28.105 --> 27:32.191
Why don't you bite my weenie, man?
I look like James Dean. Don't I?

27:33.402 --> 27:35.695
Hey, I gotta take a leak, okay?

27:39.742 --> 27:42.785
Hey, aim away
from the car, weenie.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.704
On behalf of
my mother and my father,

27:44.872 --> 27:48.082
I'd like to thank the Beverly Hills
Residents' Association

27:48.250 --> 27:50.877
for their generous award
honoring my...

27:55.257 --> 27:58.718
Help me! Help me! Help me!

27:58.886 --> 28:01.220
Relax. It's me, it's Newbomb.
It's okay. Everything's copasetic.

28:01.388 --> 28:04.349
May I have my puffer, please?
Give him his puffer.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.851
Give me his coat.
Thank you.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.438
Please don't hurt me.
I think I'm a bleeder.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.652
Mama! Mama!

28:16.820 --> 28:19.530
I won't tell anybody.
Just don't hurt me.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.282
It's me. It's me.
It really is.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.161
I would like to introduce now
three fine young ladies.

28:25.371 --> 28:29.791
The Beverly Hills cheerleaders,
with their rendition of "Razzle Dazzle."

28:59.363 --> 29:00.822
You forgot your
underwear!

29:03.492 --> 29:04.992
Your underwear!

29:10.416 --> 29:12.083
No underwear on.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.020
Clark, this is so fine.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.440
That's Newbomb's car, isn't it?
Yeah.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.024
And that's a fire hydrant, right?
Oh, yeah.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.569
So that means all this area
here is a tow-away zone, right?

29:39.736 --> 29:41.529
All of it.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.239
This is Car Three.

29:43.407 --> 29:46.576
We've got a tow-away out here
in front of the Beverly High School.

29:46.743 --> 29:49.287
A '65 El Camino, silver-gray...

29:53.667 --> 29:56.085
What the hell's going on?

29:57.004 --> 30:01.424
We're gonna need some help here.
We've both been assaulted by eggs.

30:02.468 --> 30:06.262
♪ Lawrence
Lawrence of Arabia ♪

30:06.430 --> 30:12.477
♪ He's an English guy
He came to fight the Turkish ♪♪

30:13.854 --> 30:17.565
All right, we've had
some bad luck this evening,

30:17.733 --> 30:19.775
but here's something
that nobody can ruin.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.862
This is the young man
who has won our $500 award.

30:23.030 --> 30:26.032
His name is Douglas...
Dudley Laywicker.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.826
Let's show him how proud we are
of him. Let's get him up here.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.286
Dudley, we're very...

30:30.454 --> 30:32.330
That's Newbomb Turk!

30:34.458 --> 30:36.083
Go, Newbomb, go!

30:36.251 --> 30:40.004
Hey, that's not Dudley!
That's Newbomb Turk!

31:09.451 --> 31:12.119
Oh, come on!
That's funny!

31:15.958 --> 31:19.502
Stop him! Stop him,
goddamn it! Stop him!

31:21.380 --> 31:23.673
Get that piece of crap
out of here.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.758
Lock it up,
will you?

31:27.928 --> 31:32.848
Officers! Officers, there's a guy
in there in a major-domo outfit

31:33.016 --> 31:35.017
farting all over the place.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.686
Farting.
Farting?

31:36.853 --> 31:38.354
Yes, farting.
Oh, Christ.

31:38.522 --> 31:42.316
Farting? What do you mean?
Farting. Farting.

31:44.152 --> 31:45.987
Newbomb, would you hurry up!

31:46.363 --> 31:48.656
Come on! How'd it go?
How'd it go? How'd it go?

31:48.824 --> 31:51.492
I was great. It was just swell.
Hey, that's really good. We gotta go.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.286
The cops towed your
brother's El Camino away.

31:53.453 --> 31:56.372
What?! What?!
Would you relax?

31:56.540 --> 31:58.791
What? No!
I'm a dead man!

31:58.959 --> 32:03.546
I'm doomed! No! No! No!

32:06.133 --> 32:08.092
I hope you're satisfied.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.636
I, for one, surely am not.

32:18.812 --> 32:21.314
Little ass-wipe
doesn't have any pants on.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.442
Hello. I don't know what you're
thinking, but I'm perfectly normal.

32:24.610 --> 32:29.488
I was walking down the parking lot today, and
out of the shadows something strange happened.

32:29.656 --> 32:34.535
I don't think I saw their faces, but I
think they were some people who went to...

32:34.703 --> 32:36.662
You punk! You stupid punk!

32:36.830 --> 32:39.957
I ought to beat
the living crap out of you!

32:40.125 --> 32:42.126
Bimbeau,
what are you doing?

32:43.045 --> 32:46.213
This guy farted all over the stage.
Give him air.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.674
Who are you?
School photographer, sir.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.176
Bimbeau. Put that way.

32:50.344 --> 32:53.679
This is the young man who was
supposed to get the scholarship.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.223
He's not your man, sergeant.
Bimbeau, put it away!

32:56.391 --> 32:59.435
My puffer. My puffer.
My puffer.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.937
Bimbeau, give him his puffer.
My puffer.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.023
I'm having a little difficulty...
Help him up.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.234
Oh, Christ.
Oh, God.

33:08.445 --> 33:09.779
Come on.
These are great.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.739
Now we don't have to
walk around nude.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.116
Did you hear that noise?

33:14.284 --> 33:15.743
Oh, yeah!

33:15.911 --> 33:17.578
That's some old man
poking his old lady.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.665
Are you sure?
Take my word for it, okay?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.166
Shit.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.293
Shit. Goddamn it.

33:25.629 --> 33:29.507
I wish Froggie would hurry up.
Shut up and watch the front.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.050
Oh, God.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.888
That your Halloween costume?
Yeah, kid.

33:36.098 --> 33:38.015
The fool ain't got no dick, Earle.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.142
Get out of here, kid!

33:42.270 --> 33:44.146
Hey, check us out.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.607
Put this on.
Great, you assholes.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.610
Do you know where we're at?
I forgot.

33:50.028 --> 33:55.991
Oh, shit, Martha! The Ku Klux Klan's
outside the window! Get my gun!

33:56.159 --> 33:58.160
Take that off!
Let's get out of here!

34:00.539 --> 34:02.164
Wait a minute, honey!

34:05.711 --> 34:07.628
Sing it pretty.
Sing it.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.597
Talking about you, baby.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.905
We can't get out of here
until we get in that record store.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.866
They only take dedications
in person.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.701
Hey, man, we're up shit's creek.

34:38.869 --> 34:42.204
I'm telling you, my brother was a Knight, and
my uncle was a Knight, and I'm gonna be one too.

34:42.371 --> 34:45.583
Why don't you use the phone booth and
call your cousin to get us out of here?

34:45.751 --> 34:49.962
What, are you dense, man? You go in the phone
booth, shut the door, the light goes on.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.547
You think I'm gonna be standing
out here naked in the middle of Watts

34:52.716 --> 34:55.259
on Halloween night?
You need a lobotomy.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.511
We'd better do something,
that's for sure.

34:57.679 --> 35:00.014
We gotta get clothes, we gotta
get into that record store,

35:00.182 --> 35:02.975
make a dedication,
get back to Tubby's at 2:00.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.602
We should've joined
the swim team.

35:04.770 --> 35:08.481
You got Dr. J.,
ofay but okay,

35:08.648 --> 35:11.609
as Motown strikes again!

35:12.486 --> 35:14.028
Suzie.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.991
Hi. Want a drink?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.619
Cold, huh?
Yeah.

35:23.497 --> 35:27.041
How about a free kiss?
That never cost you anything.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.919
Oh, yes, they did.
I started getting used to them.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.837
Gets kind of dangerous.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.136
What do you wanna do?

35:39.304 --> 35:41.639
I wanna be rich and famous.
I'm already good-looking.

35:42.098 --> 35:45.351
Is this your first beer?
Yeah. I'm a cheap high.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.019
So am I.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.231
So, what's your plan?

35:50.398 --> 35:51.857
Plans don't always...
Suzie.

35:52.025 --> 35:54.318
You got an order up there.
Okay.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.488
So, what do you
wanna do?

35:58.114 --> 36:01.575
I don't know what I wanna do.
I just know what I don't wanna do.

36:02.077 --> 36:05.579
I mean, maybe that's what I'm asking for,
is just a little time to figure it out.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.083
A place to do it,
somebody to do it with.

36:12.963 --> 36:16.006
I was thinking about Venice.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.426
A little apartment down there
about a block from the beach.

36:19.594 --> 36:23.097
You're asking me to just walk away
from it for some pipe dream.

36:23.265 --> 36:27.560
Pipe dream? Talk about a pipe dream.
Tell me what acting is.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.069
Hey, you wanna go to the
beach with me tomorrow?

36:37.237 --> 36:41.240
Duke, you know I have
my screen test in the morning.

36:41.408 --> 36:43.409
Yeah. I forgot.

36:43.577 --> 36:46.954
See, that's what it is. You're there,
and I'm here. We're in two different places.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.832
Well, you just go in there tomorrow
and knock them dead.

36:50.500 --> 36:54.211
Why do you have to be so sarcastic?
Can't you give me a little support?

36:54.379 --> 36:56.714
Suzie, pickup, please!

37:11.771 --> 37:15.316
Hey, there's Newbomb.
He went home and got his pie wagon.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.531
Gentlemen, I am here.
You can start.

37:22.699 --> 37:25.826
You know that chick Barbara?
You're right. She does put out.

37:27.037 --> 37:28.454
Hey, you guys want a menu?

37:28.622 --> 37:30.706
Only if you're on it.
Only if you're on it.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.252
Hey, Newbomb,
your brother's out front.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.296
Shit.
What?

37:37.464 --> 37:39.089
Stay here. You didn't see me.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.717
You never saw me.
I don't even know you.

37:41.885 --> 37:44.053
You don't know me. You never knew me.
You never will know me.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.139
I don't wanna hit you. Why?
Try and hit me.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.227
How you doing?
Hey, you seen Newbomb?

37:52.395 --> 37:55.356
Mom said he had my El Camino.
No, I haven't seen him.

37:55.523 --> 37:58.734
If he messes up my El Camino,
I swear I'm gonna strangle his ass.

37:59.069 --> 38:02.029
I'll tell him you're looking for him.
Yeah.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.157
Hey, have you seen my El Camino?
No, I haven't.

38:05.325 --> 38:07.576
This is his pie wagon.
Where is he?

38:07.869 --> 38:11.705
Uh, him and Simpson are working
on Simpson's rail job.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.500
Oh, okay.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.085
Hey, Turk.

38:16.336 --> 38:18.462
Your car looks really bitchen.

38:20.507 --> 38:23.092
Hey, listen, you see him,
you tell him I'm gonna nail his butt.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.386
You got that?
Yeah. Yeah.

38:25.553 --> 38:28.389
Take it easy.
All right.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.938
See you guys later.
Really bitchen car.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.651
Hey, Newbomb, he's gone.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.698
Hey, Newbomb,
that was your brother.

38:45.865 --> 38:48.242
He's gonna kick your ass.
He's looking for you.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.788
He's looking for me?
He's looking for me?

38:52.956 --> 38:54.707
That pussy's looking for me?

38:54.916 --> 38:56.834
You do the windup.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.804
What'd you think about
the Rolling Stones last night?

39:08.972 --> 39:10.597
They were so dirty.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.850
I mean, that guy's teeth.
Did you see them?

39:13.018 --> 39:16.603
His skin was even worse than that.
But it was a great song.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.230
Great song.

39:18.398 --> 39:21.650
Goddamn these machines. They never work.
What are we doing here anyway?

39:21.818 --> 39:24.570
What are we doing here?
We are looking for cute guys.

39:24.738 --> 39:27.698
Cute? Like that Newbomb Turk?
I bet that's cute.

39:27.866 --> 39:31.785
Can you imagine
having to kiss that face?

39:32.579 --> 39:35.414
Did you see Thunder Thighs
over there with Sally?

39:35.582 --> 39:37.082
What a slut.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.210
Speaking of sluts,
did you hear about Jean Friedman?

39:40.378 --> 39:42.546
What?
She had an abortion in Tijuana.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.467
That doesn't surprise me. I heard she
gave half the football team the clap.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.927
They played like they
still had it last week too.

39:49.095 --> 39:52.139
Hey, that was Brenda and Shirley
Weintraub, the Iron Box Twins,

39:52.307 --> 39:55.809
coming to you live from the ladies'
room here at Tubby's Drive-In.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.688
You asshole!
You schmuck!

40:12.410 --> 40:16.622
Nookie wagon! Here it comes!
Here comes the nookie wagon!

40:23.296 --> 40:25.380
How you guys doing, man?
What's happening?

40:25.548 --> 40:27.716
Not much, not much.
She's starving.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.552
Ready to order?
Yes.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.721
We want three hamburgers

40:32.889 --> 40:35.099
and three orders
of onion rings.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.519
And I want a vanilla shake.
And I want a Coke.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.395
Got it.
Thank you.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.899
What are you doing, man?
Not much. Hanging out at the beach.

40:44.067 --> 40:47.027
Heard about Tubby's and everything.
Thought we'd come check it out.

40:47.195 --> 40:50.823
I want a Big One! I'm so sick and
tired of those shitty Ding-Dongs, man!

40:50.990 --> 40:53.158
I know, you gotta lay off that surfer food.
It'll do you in.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.660
Hey, you should talk.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.871
Hey, why don't you guys come down to the
beach sometime? I'll show you a boss time.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.374
No, thanks. Sticking my head
in a bunch of seaweed

41:00.542 --> 41:02.918
is not my idea
of a bitchen time.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.504
Try it sometime.
Might do you some good.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.173
Hey, this is Jane,
and this is Cheetah.

41:08.341 --> 41:11.552
Wait a second.
You're Jane, you're Cheetah.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.053
And what are their names?

41:13.221 --> 41:15.389
Eyes off.
Hey, dummy up, man.

41:15.557 --> 41:17.558
And my name is Newbomb Turk.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.727
Hey, Turk!
How you doing, man?

41:20.895 --> 41:22.229
Good, good. Okay.

41:22.397 --> 41:25.899
Hey, where's
the Duker and Jimmy Shine?

41:26.067 --> 41:28.026
Who knows? Who cares?
Where's your deuce coupe?

41:28.194 --> 41:31.196
It's at the old man's shop, all covered up.
I'm thinking about selling it.

41:31.364 --> 41:34.366
What for? You've been
working on it for about three years.

41:34.534 --> 41:37.744
But I've just been hanging out at the beach,
crashing in this woody.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.622
What do you do for money?
Old man takes care of me.

41:40.790 --> 41:44.168
He's giving me all the money I want so
long as I stay away from the house.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.420
He thinks I do more damage
if I show up there.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.216
What?

42:00.935 --> 42:02.269
Need a pair of pliers
for those?

42:02.770 --> 42:05.105
Just got my damn shirt
caught in it.

42:05.273 --> 42:08.025
Hey, pencil dick,
what time is it?

42:08.818 --> 42:10.903
Time to eat!

42:24.167 --> 42:26.335
Okay. All right.

42:27.420 --> 42:29.963
Chinese bandits,
2 o'clock!

42:30.256 --> 42:32.216
Bounces pretty good, pal.

43:08.044 --> 43:10.379
Duke might've got whupped
by them almond-eyes guys,

43:10.546 --> 43:13.882
but I'm going home to get my rail job,
and I'm gonna leave them...

43:14.050 --> 43:17.094
I'm with you, man.
You know the power of that car.

43:17.262 --> 43:20.681
Those Chinese assholes.
They sneak up on you.

43:24.394 --> 43:27.312
That Cobra ain't shit anyway.
Hey, he came in second.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.899
"But he came in second."
Ha! Thanks a lot.

43:31.067 --> 43:33.026
I see you guys are having
a good time tonight, huh?

43:33.194 --> 43:35.362
And it's gonna get
a lot better later.

43:39.867 --> 43:43.370
Okay, asshole, pull this yellow piece of
shit around the corner here. You got me?

43:43.746 --> 43:45.747
Hear that? Move it.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.625
Right now, asshole.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.299
Hey, Officer Clark,
are you lost or something?

43:56.509 --> 43:58.427
Bitchen.
Do me a favor.

43:58.594 --> 44:01.054
Jimmy Shine's going off
to Vietnam tomorrow,

44:01.222 --> 44:03.307
and you're worried about
the beach is bitchen.

44:03.474 --> 44:06.435
Who's got the burger?
I got a burger.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.105
What are you doing, Newbomb?

44:10.523 --> 44:13.358
Get your...
I was just getting some burger.

44:13.526 --> 44:15.319
Oh, you were getting
some burger, huh?

44:15.486 --> 44:18.447
Well, you want a little shake
to go along with your burger?

44:18.614 --> 44:21.033
Hey, watch out, man!

44:23.411 --> 44:26.538
You know what? I think the guys are
weenies for not letting us in the dance.

44:26.873 --> 44:29.916
But I could care less, man. I didn't
want to go to that stupid dance.

44:30.293 --> 44:32.461
I think dancing's for queers anyway.

44:35.548 --> 44:37.507
This song is bitchen.
Check this song out.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.969
Look, I'm telling you, man.
The Knights are not breaking up, all right.

44:41.137 --> 44:44.014
Suppose Jimmy Shine
doesn't come back from Vietnam.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.725
Oh, man, don't worry
about Jimmy Shine.

44:46.893 --> 44:49.019
There's not even a war going on.
He's going over for training.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.855
What about Duke?
Duke can take care of himself.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.524
And Shorty, man.
Shorty's going to college.

44:55.902 --> 44:58.904
Look, don't worry about Shorty.
We're gonna stick together, all right?

44:59.072 --> 45:01.448
You can cruise with me, man.
All right?

45:01.616 --> 45:03.408
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of you.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.805
Come on, man.
Let's get this stuff out of here, you know.

45:31.979 --> 45:34.147
What do they have in this?
They got the punch in here.

45:34.315 --> 45:36.608
Gentlemen, are you from the caterers?
Yeah.

45:36.776 --> 45:38.610
Of course you are.
Is that the punch?

45:38.820 --> 45:40.153
Uh-huh.

45:40.321 --> 45:45.492
Oh, no, no. Please put it down. You're going the long
way. Take the shortcut. Cut right across the lawn.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.494
Go right across the lawn
through the nice hibiscus.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.663
I don't think the gardener's gonna
like that come Monday morning.

45:49.831 --> 45:52.999
They're gonna re-landscape Monday morning.
They're having a new library there.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.960
The Newbomb Turk
Memorial Library.

45:55.878 --> 45:57.671
Newbomb Turk.
You've heard of him.

45:57.839 --> 45:59.756
Oh, yeah,
I know that guy.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.758
You heard of him?
Yeah, sure.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.927
I assure you, there's nothing wrong.
You can leave the punch here.

46:04.095 --> 46:08.223
Uh, garçon! Garçon. Boy, boy, boy.
Take this punch down there.

46:08.391 --> 46:11.726
It'll be our pleasure to take care of this.
Anything happens, give them my name.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.854
It's okay. Fine.
Have a nice time.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.857
Thanks a lot for taking care of things.
My pleasure, my pleasure.

46:58.441 --> 46:59.774
Come on, come on,
come on.

46:59.942 --> 47:02.819
Come on.
This one is for Tubby's.

47:05.156 --> 47:08.200
Gentlemen,
let's spike the punch.

47:32.767 --> 47:34.142
Hey, can I help you?

47:34.310 --> 47:36.895
This is the punch for the Beverly
Hills Residents' Association.

47:37.063 --> 47:40.065
Name?
No name. Just punch.

47:43.236 --> 47:44.945
Don't drink the punch.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.864
Hey, don't drink the punch.

47:48.032 --> 47:50.242
Don't drink the punch, man.

47:54.830 --> 47:56.915
You little son of a bitch.

47:59.043 --> 48:01.461
Hey, you thirsty?
Why don't you have some punch?

48:02.421 --> 48:04.381
Stay away from the punch.

48:05.591 --> 48:08.885
Like some more?
No, thanks, it's fine.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.721
Well, trick or treat.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.306
You're already a treat.

48:13.474 --> 48:15.642
You're already a trick.

48:17.770 --> 48:20.772
This doesn't taste right.
Yeah, it's good.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.357
No, it's not right.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.943
My dick is in the punch!

48:25.570 --> 48:29.656
I've had this taste in my mouth before.
It tastes all right to me.

48:30.783 --> 48:32.993
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, hi.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.162
Little bastards.
I'm just gonna ignore them.

48:36.330 --> 48:40.292
I'm not paying attention to them.
There's a young man out there.

48:40.668 --> 48:42.711
My dick! My dick!

48:42.878 --> 48:46.214
I believe he's looking
for somebody called Dick.

48:46.382 --> 48:49.134
Is there a Dick here?

48:49.302 --> 48:53.388
I've got it, Nevans. It's spiked.
They've spiked the punch.

48:53.556 --> 48:56.308
Thorny, get those officers.

48:57.018 --> 48:58.810
Now, I know this taste.

49:01.022 --> 49:03.315
Yeah, yeah, yeah. My dick.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.775
What seems to be
the problem, ma'am?

49:06.110 --> 49:08.862
Officer, taste this.
Taste this.

49:09.030 --> 49:11.239
Tell me what you think.

49:18.581 --> 49:22.584
Does have a little wang in it.
Good, though.

49:22.752 --> 49:25.253
Excuse me.
Mind if I have some more?

49:25.421 --> 49:27.505
No, no, please.
Thank you.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.841
Help yourself. Come on, Nevans.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.510
Try and get a piece of fruit there.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.180
You've gotta be
very careful, Dudley.

49:35.348 --> 49:37.641
You're a marked man.
I'll be fine.

49:37.808 --> 49:39.309
They're envious of you.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.896
Which trick should I do?
They're all so good.

49:43.064 --> 49:45.273
Well, stick to your music, dear.

49:55.326 --> 49:56.993
Watch the road.

50:01.707 --> 50:04.751
After the talent contest,
I want you to go right home.

50:04.919 --> 50:07.462
I'm gonna drop you
at the rear entrance.

50:10.257 --> 50:13.009
With more atomic power,
"In the Midnight Hour."

50:16.389 --> 50:20.558
Man, this sure is a funny place
to build a library.

50:20.935 --> 50:22.602
Yeah.
Newbomb Turk.

50:22.770 --> 50:26.189
You know what?
I think I heard of that guy before.

50:26.357 --> 50:29.526
He had something to do with something in
Beverly Hills or something, man. Yeah.

50:29.694 --> 50:31.569
Maybe he's the one giving
the money to build the library.

50:31.821 --> 50:34.531
Yeah, you're probably right.
Hold it, man. Don't drink all that beer.

50:34.699 --> 50:38.159
I got you covered. Just come on.
What should we do?

50:38.327 --> 50:41.871
Just drive the truck through here.
I would like to get home tonight.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.373
Well, here goes nothing.

50:50.715 --> 51:03.685
That... That... That car!

51:03.853 --> 51:06.813
I told you not to come in here!
You killed my flowers!

51:06.981 --> 51:09.816
That man in the parking lot
told us to come down here.

51:10.025 --> 51:12.986
The man that's having
the memorial library built.

51:13.154 --> 51:15.321
Oh, no!
That rich guy over there.

51:15.489 --> 51:17.490
Who did this?
Told us about Newbomb Turk.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.576
Newbomb Turk did this!

51:19.744 --> 51:22.704
I know!
Newbomb, that asshole!

51:26.125 --> 51:28.168
Oh, Dudley.

51:28.502 --> 51:31.379
Dudley, come here.
We want to show you something.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.090
I... I... I...
Dudley, come over here.

51:34.258 --> 51:36.134
Come on.

51:36.302 --> 51:38.720
Dudley, I want to
show you something.

51:38.888 --> 51:43.391
Come here, Dudley.
I want to show you something. Come here.

51:48.272 --> 51:49.814
Dudley, look.

51:55.404 --> 51:57.155
Dudley, are you okay?

51:57.323 --> 51:59.324
Oh, yes.
Oh, good.

52:00.743 --> 52:03.578
It's gonna be all right.

52:03.746 --> 52:05.497
Newbomb, is that you again?

52:05.664 --> 52:07.582
Yeah, Dudley. Sorry.
Nothing personal.

52:07.750 --> 52:09.334
I understand, I think.

52:09.502 --> 52:11.836
Please be careful with the cape.
I will.

52:12.004 --> 52:14.756
It's rented.
Have a beer, buddy.

52:15.841 --> 52:17.801
I hope you win the contest.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.345
Thanks, Dud, that's sweet.
Watch your head, bye.

52:22.932 --> 52:24.015
Well done, ladies.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.451
Uh-uh, I...
Hey, hey, hey.

52:43.619 --> 52:45.328
You can do it.

52:45.913 --> 52:47.747
I can do it.

52:48.415 --> 52:50.041
My boy.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.519
Hello? One, two?

53:09.687 --> 53:11.187
Did you hear about Jean Friedman?

53:11.355 --> 53:14.399
She had an abortion in Tijuana.

53:14.567 --> 53:16.609
They're talking about
my daughter!

53:16.777 --> 53:20.697
I'm not surprised. I heard she gave
half the football team the clap.

53:20.865 --> 53:23.449
They were playing
like it last week too.

53:23.617 --> 53:26.494
That was Brenda and Shirley Weintraub,
the Iron Box Twins,

53:26.662 --> 53:29.914
coming to you live from the ladies' room
at Tubby's Drive-In this Halloween night.

53:38.048 --> 53:41.134
But I cannot function
without my glasses or my puffer.

53:41.302 --> 53:43.303
Dudley, would you
just relax and stay put?

53:43.470 --> 53:45.305
I'll be back in a few minutes
with my rail job.

53:45.472 --> 53:47.473
Don't forget me.
I won't forget you.

53:47.641 --> 53:49.601
Just stay put.
Because I'm a little scared.

53:49.768 --> 53:52.979
There's nothing
to be scared of. Stay put.

54:01.113 --> 54:05.116
So let's welcome, please, um...

54:05.284 --> 54:07.327
He's a wonderful one-armed...

54:07.953 --> 54:10.330
Uh, one-armed violinist.

54:11.749 --> 54:13.333
Mr...

54:13.500 --> 54:16.002
Mr. Sasha Du... Da...

54:16.170 --> 54:20.882
Mr. Sasha Dabinsky, the one-armed
violinist. Let's welcome him.

54:30.851 --> 54:35.229
I presume that must be...
Well... The one-armed violinist.

55:05.427 --> 55:09.222
It's impossible!
He grabbed it with his dick!

55:09.932 --> 55:12.183
Stop applauding! Stop applauding!

55:14.436 --> 55:16.270
Stop applauding!

55:17.022 --> 55:20.233
Making fun of handicapped people...
Excuse me.

55:20.401 --> 55:23.778
Making fun of handicapped people
is not my idea of a joke.

55:23.946 --> 55:26.990
There may be people laughing,
but I'm telling you, we can fight.

55:27.157 --> 55:31.119
They may be laughing now, but they'll be laughing
out the other side of their faces in the morning

55:31.286 --> 55:35.331
when we start tearing down that
social disease of Beverly Hills!

55:35.499 --> 55:38.251
Tubby's is gonna be torn down!
He grabbed it with his dick!

55:38.752 --> 55:40.878
I beg your pardon, sir.

55:43.424 --> 55:45.717
I miss your big Buick.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.815
Oh, that's great.
Here.

56:04.486 --> 56:06.195
Oh, I love it.

56:09.158 --> 56:12.452
God, you feel great.
Don't mess my hair up, though.

56:12.619 --> 56:14.746
Honey, I didn't touch your hair.

56:17.624 --> 56:20.209
Oh, shit.
Hello?

56:20.377 --> 56:24.297
Hello. Oh, hello. Excuse me, I'm lost.
Could you show me the way to the dance?

56:24.590 --> 56:27.258
It's way over there.
Yes, over that way.

56:27.426 --> 56:30.136
Mrs. Friedman?
Mrs. Friedman!

56:30.304 --> 56:33.097
Oh, Dudley, you...
Hello.

56:34.224 --> 56:37.393
Get my clothes.
Oh, shit.

56:37.561 --> 56:39.353
Look. We're all in our underwear.

56:39.563 --> 56:43.066
You know, I'm a real nice girl. I've got
the best reputation in our high school.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.485
I heard about
your reputation.

57:16.308 --> 57:17.558
Mike, I can't do it.

57:17.726 --> 57:19.602
That's all right.
You can't get pregnant this way.

57:19.770 --> 57:22.396
I'm not that type of girl.
You can't get pregnant.

57:22.564 --> 57:24.107
Okay. Okay.
Right there.

57:24.274 --> 57:27.026
How's that? How's that?
Faster! Faster!

57:27.194 --> 57:29.445
Oh, God!
It's caught in the zipper!

57:29.613 --> 57:31.155
No! Get away!

57:31.323 --> 57:34.700
Oh, don't touch it!
Don't touch it! Let it go down!

57:34.868 --> 57:37.245
I gotta wait. No, I just gotta
wait till the swelling goes down!

57:40.249 --> 57:43.918
Dark, you are like a dead putz.
I mean, this is a party.

57:44.086 --> 57:47.922
We're supposed to have fun, music,
pastrami. What's wrong with you?

57:48.090 --> 57:52.260
Turk, come over here. Now, he
happens to be very hysterically funny.

57:52.427 --> 57:54.637
I put him right up there
with Steve and Eydie.

57:54.805 --> 58:00.309
He has more talent in his little pinkie
than you have in your whole pinkie.

58:00.477 --> 58:03.521
Why don't you just go blow?
I mean, you make me nauseous.

58:03.689 --> 58:07.400
High school girls.
I should have known better.

58:07.776 --> 58:09.277
Humpf.

58:10.445 --> 58:14.407
You know, you have
impeccable taste.

58:14.575 --> 58:18.327
Listen, I'm having
a party at my house. Uh...

58:18.495 --> 58:20.496
You wanna take me?

58:24.668 --> 58:26.043
To the pie wagon.

58:26.211 --> 58:31.883
On a beautiful Halloween night,
1965, with Dr. J. On the burner!

58:54.615 --> 58:57.033
Go. Go.
Okay.

59:05.209 --> 59:07.627
Oh, Turk. Turk.

59:09.254 --> 59:11.464
Oh, Turk. Turk, I'm ready.

59:11.882 --> 59:13.674
Come here, Turk.

59:13.842 --> 59:15.801
This is just like
in the movies.

59:15.969 --> 59:19.597
Oh, I'm wearing my mother's
musk-scent perfume.

59:19.765 --> 59:22.934
Oh, Turk. Turk,
come back here.

59:23.101 --> 59:25.728
Come on, before I lose
the feeling, Turk.

59:25.896 --> 59:28.231
Turk, come on.

59:28.565 --> 59:31.150
Turk? Turk?

59:31.360 --> 59:34.153
Come on, Turk. Come back here.

59:34.321 --> 59:35.738
Come on.
Um...

59:36.865 --> 59:39.909
Come on, Turk.
What?

59:40.077 --> 59:42.620
It's not right.
What?

59:42.788 --> 59:44.247
It's not right.
What's not right?

59:44.414 --> 59:47.291
The mood's not right.
What do you mean?

59:47.584 --> 59:50.670
What do you mean? I'm in the mood!
I'm ready. I'm hot. I'm ready to go.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.965
Come on! I'm all hot and bothered!
Are you kidding me?

59:54.424 --> 59:56.509
Turk! Did you come?

59:56.969 --> 59:58.552
Turk. Turk.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.514
What?
Did you come?

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:03.766
A little.
A little?

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.893
What do you mean?
Either you came or you didn't!

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.728
Did you come or not?
I came.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.606
Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed.
I came. I came.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:14.235
Give me my shirt back. Oh, my God!
You came! I can't believe it!

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:17.238
You are so immature.
I am not immature!

01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:20.074
I came. It happens.
I'm sorry it happened.

01:00:20.242 --> 01:00:22.743
Who does it happen to?
It's all very personal.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.456
I'm glad I came. You know that?
I'm glad I came. I really am.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.041
God, are you
something!

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.420
This is the engine of the future.

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.630
In a VW.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:36.465
Funny.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.093
There's only six of those
in the country.

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.929
Yeah, but Nader's gonna stop
all this. There won't be no more.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.723
Yeah, I'm afraid you're right.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:47.560
If that's Sharon, tell her I've gone.

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:50.771
Guys, let's do this another night.
Kiss my ass.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:52.440
He's already gone.

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:55.943
You sure you
wanna see this?

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:57.862
What, are you crazy?
Come on.

01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.822
Let's do it.

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.763
Is this piss yellow?

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:29.310
That's Tony Nancy
yellow.

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:32.605
Hey, Jimmy, check this out.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:39.111
Laz was over here today
rubbing this thing out.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:41.614
His back went,
and Al came in and finished it.

01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:43.616
Hey, he did a good job.

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:47.411
Phew. Man.
Hey, who put the tune on it?

01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:50.664
Fiasco.
Boy, does it run sweet.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.626
Tony, what about
that other thing?

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.669
What other thing?

01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:59.090
You know. The thing.

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:02.802
Hey, what's the deal?

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:06.305
It's a little going-away present,
Jim, from the Knights

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:08.682
and the guys here at the shop,
they all chipped in.

01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:13.771
Junior put it in.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:54.562
Ahead of the headlines, this is
the 1 a.m. Edition of KBLA News,

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:58.023
presented by the car
of the future, Studebaker.

01:02:59.568 --> 01:03:03.946
Come on, come on. Let's get those tires
in the van and let's split, brother.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:12.788
We'll never get back by 2, man.
Forget it.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:19.211
Damn, look at your car.
Where the hell are my tires?

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:22.756
Get them!

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:37.021
Why do these guys singing rock 'n'
roll have to wear those kind of glasses?

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:40.858
God, it's gonna be weird
living back in New York.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:44.695
What's wrong, Suzie?
Duke getting you crazy?

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:46.989
I don't know.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.742
He go to the dance
without you?

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:53.913
I guess so.
That's the way it goes.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:57.791
Yeah. He'll probably be back later when
I close the place and have a beer.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:00.419
Guy's being tough
on you, huh?

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.132
What time's the screen test
tomorrow?

01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:06.926
Seven.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.929
Don't let it bother you.
Be good tomorrow.

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:12.556
Thanks.

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:18.437
Hey, Jimmy, what time do you
have to leave tomorrow?

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:19.939
I gotta be up at 6.

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:22.191
Dee Dee's waiting for me.
I gotta get over there.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:25.945
She's cooked a roast. We're gonna
drink a bottle of champagne.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.697
We'll go to Santa Monica pier
and watch the sun come up.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.701
Hey, that sounds like
pretty romantic stuff to me.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.871
Hey, I remember one time,
I was in Okinawa.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:38.332
Me and this buddy of mine
named Grease...

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.292
Best damn mechanic
I ever seen.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:43.879
Anyway, me and Grease took this
Thunderbolt engine out of a crate,

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.924
modified that son of a bitch
and put it in a little jeep.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.426
I mean, they was having
a parade that day.

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.471
I mean, MacArthur and his whole
hot-damn staff were there, man.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.140
Anyway, me and this Grease
got in that jeep

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.768
and we blew by that parade.
Oh, shit, man.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:02.106
It must've been 150 miles an hour.
MPs are still looking for us.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:06.193
They found the jeep.
They only suspected it was us.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:07.903
What happened
to Grease?

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:12.783
That son of a bitch got drunk and
drove a command car into an ammo dump

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:16.245
and the whole thing went up,
and they never did find nothing.

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.623
War's funny, huh?

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:27.381
Hey, listen. I wanna
say something. Um...

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.845
If something happens to me
while I'm gone...

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:34.888
I don't know,
anything.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:39.226
- I don't want that the car should...

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:42.980
Well, Dee Dee wouldn't know
what to do with it and...

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:47.568
I want the car should go to the club.
You know, all the guys.

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:49.737
Hell, that was the big one.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:51.447
Vietnam's nothing like that.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:53.907
I know, I know, I know,
but I'm just saying, just in case.

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:57.244
Hey, listen, nothing's gonna happen.
Let's get some beers.

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:14.303
This is Dr. J. On KBLA, the boss with the
hot sauce. I'm gonna tell you something.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:15.971
This is for lovers only.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.349
This is for everybody
up on Mulholland Drive.

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.017
I want you to do me a favor.

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:22.353
I want you to put one hand
on the radio

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.272
and the other hand
wherever you feel it should be.

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:29.610
And that's exactly where you're
putting me on Halloween night, 1965.

01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:31.236
For lovers only.

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:35.824
We'll never make it back.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.868
It's after 1:00.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.754
Hey, how you doing?

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:56.428
See if they'll help us.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.648
How you doing, Mrs. Johnson?
Maybe these guys will help us.

01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:09.274
Hey, let's ask them.

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:14.697
Hey, what's going on?
We need you guys to do us a favor.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.992
We're trying to get into
this car gang in Beverly Hills.

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:22.496
They dropped us here, took our
clothes and left us four spare tires.

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:25.541
We gotta get to Hollywood by 2:00.
It's an initiation.

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:29.044
But we need a dedication in that
record store from the disc jockey.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.547
You guys gotta do us a big favor
and make a dedication.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:33.924
Okay. What you want?
The song is "Heat Wave."

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:37.261
Gotta get it on by 2:00, and if you can,
try to get him to say something like,

01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:39.263
"To anyone who
ever cruises Tubby's."

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:41.348
Right.
Tubby's, huh?

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:44.935
Tubby's, all right?
"Cruises Tubby's," all right?

01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:50.315
My brother Willy T. Here has the best.
We kind of gotta go.

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:54.361
If you're ever in the neighborhood,
come on over for lox and bagels.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.447
You cats smoke any of
this shit before?

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:59.742
Oh, yeah, we smoke
that stuff all the time.

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:02.953
Check this out, man.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:06.206
That'll put a hem in
your dress. You'll love it.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.916
It is a killer.

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:14.381
Hold it in, right?
Hold it in.

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.258
It's a killer, isn't it?

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:57.549
Give me a hit of that, man.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:02.763
From the desert to the sea, soulfully.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.812
Please let me hold you.
No, I'm all right.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.439
No, you're not. What you need is
a good hot sauna and a massage.

01:09:13.608 --> 01:09:15.149
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:18.946
And you're not mad no more?
No. No, I'm all right.

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:25.160
One more call about those Knights,
your ass is in the meat grinder.

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:29.747
Listen, I don't know what
you've been doing all night,

01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:33.752
but you're gonna have the lieutenant
all over your butts tomorrow.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.337
There was a kidnapping
at the pep rally.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:40.551
And somebody farted their way
around the gym at show time.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:44.638
Then you two end up assaulting
an honor student.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:48.975
Then the lawn over at
the country club dance was torn up.

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:52.104
Somebody urinated
in the refreshments,

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:55.274
played a lewd recording
over the PA.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:58.902
Then somebody went on-stage
and stuck his finger out

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:01.613
in place of his dick or something.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:04.491
I've never seen anybody
as asleep at the wheel

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:08.161
as you two have been tonight.
Now, wake up!

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.455
You get it?

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:18.547
Hey, Newbomb,
where's your El Camino?

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.676
Asshole.
That guy is such an asshole.

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.263
What the hell did you say?

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.057
What the hell did you say?!

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:32.561
I said, "It's cold. Brrr.
Real cold."

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:35.439
That son of a bitch.

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:39.067
He usually goes to the can about now.
I got an idea.

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.111
I got an idea. I'm gonna
get this asshole.

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:43.697
Shorty! I'll really
get this asshole.

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:46.408
Tarzan. Tarzan,
come here for a second.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.912
Listen, go to the head. Take a roll of
toilet paper. Shove it all the way in.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.955
Stuff it up.
I don't want anything coming up.

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:55.292
You got your screwdriver? Got it?
Yeah, I got it.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.129
Go to Brother Earle's and get a potato,
an unpeeled potato.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:06.678
Hey, dumb-ass,
get over there!

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:08.472
What the hell...?
I want to get a chip.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.390
You got this crap
all over me.

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:13.769
You want a chip?
Here's a damn chip.

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:22.694
Hey, Iron Box!

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:28.408
Don't you think I'd look good
in a mustache?

01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:30.744
Yeah. You'd look better
than good.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:35.082
You'd look perfect,
like a perfect horse's ass.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.626
You're just jealous,
that's all.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:40.212
I'm gonna go take a whiz.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:43.090
Just make sure you wash
your hands, all right?

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:47.552
Just don't slam the door, okay?
You're gonna spill my milk.

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.877
Clark...

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.669
Oh, shit!

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:42.709
Holy shit.

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.550
Come on, hurry. Hurry!

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:57.474
This one's for Tubby's.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:07.692
"Where's your El Camino?
Where's your El Camino?"

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.903
Officer Bimbeau!

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:23.375
Oh! Oh...

01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:26.711
Oh, shit! Hey, Clark!

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:28.588
Clark!

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.549
Hey!

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.430
Clark! Clark!

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.684
Bimbeau? Bimbeau!
Clark, come on!

01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:43.270
I'm in here!
What's going on? What?

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.938
I'm locked in here!

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.732
Okay. All right.
Get back, Bimbeau!

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:52.112
Clark! Clark!

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:57.284
Clark! You asshole!

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.498
Clark!
Get up there.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:07.335
What's the matter with you?
What the hell were you doing?

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:10.338
I gotta get my shoe!
Get your shoe!

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.466
Look at my new shoes!

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.093
You look wonderful.

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:17.470
That was funny. That was real funny.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:22.559
It was wonderful. It was just...
It was great.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.807
Help! Help! Help!

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:11.316
Get back! Give him air!

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:15.278
Shut up! Shut your mouth!
This punk is drunk!

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:17.572
Get your ass up!
He's not drunk.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:20.575
He's the honor student.
He's having an epileptic fit!

01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:24.120
Do something!
A fit? Put something in his mouth.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:27.207
He'd swallow his tongue.
Shove the nightstick in his mouth.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.917
No! No! No!

01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:31.461
No! No! No!
I'm fine. I'm all right.

01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:33.713
He's up! It's a miracle!

01:16:44.976 --> 01:16:48.895
Your lights. Your lights. You didn't turn
on your lights. Your lights. Your lights.

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:58.280
Now look what you did.
Look what you did.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:01.616
What? What in the hell
are you talking...?

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.869
Why are you riding shotgun for?
I'm not driving. You are.

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.496
You go to sleep in the back seat.

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:09.040
You're supposed to be watching out!
Let me drive!

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:19.551
Blow him away.

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:29.477
Go!

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:12.062
Way to go, weenie!

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:13.938
Hey.

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:17.442
Take care of this
until I get back home, okay?

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:21.738
For me?
Well, you earned it.

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:26.117
Put it on, man.
Thanks, man.

01:18:37.797 --> 01:18:40.215
What about the pledges
we left in Watts?

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:42.342
What about those guys?
Where are they?

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.553
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Maybe we should go get them.

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:47.305
Wait. We're...?

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.974
We're going to go to Watts

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:53.853
at 2:00 in the morning?

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.903
Let's go.

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:06.324
Ah, what the hell. Hey, everybody!
Beer's on the house!

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:09.285
What are they gonna do,
close us down, Smitty?

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:15.500
How was the dance?

01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:18.253
I don't know. I didn't go.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:22.257
Where you been?

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:24.300
Out there.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:30.140
How was it?
It's okay.

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:33.435
Don't shut me out.

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:41.776
Hey, you know, I can handle
blowing the screen test...

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.032
as long as I don't
blow it with you.

01:19:52.163 --> 01:19:55.582
I just gotta say
I was there.

01:19:57.168 --> 01:20:00.920
I'm just asking you
for a chance to fail.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:07.218
Listen...

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:10.638
I'm not afraid
of you failing.

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:13.558
But, uh...

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:17.228
I guess what I'm
really afraid of is,

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:19.189
if you make it,

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.691
I won't be good enough
for you.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.571
I love you.

01:20:43.923 --> 01:20:45.590
Crystals, baby, and "Uptown."

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:50.595
This is your brother Dr. J. On KBLA,
approaching the 2 a.m. Hour.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.639
Dr. J.
What's happening?

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:54.933
This is June Bug, Willy T.
How you doing?

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:56.851
Hey, man. What's up?

01:20:57.061 --> 01:21:00.230
We got this dedication.
Some pledges on the corner...

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:01.898
Right here?
Yeah. Right there.

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:04.359
They want this on the radio?
Yeah.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:06.653
You got it.
They requested it for a car club.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.446
Okay, okay.
I'm gonna take care of it.

01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:10.907
There's a place over there on Wilshire
Boulevard. Everybody knows it.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:15.328
It's called Tubby's Drive-In. And you know what?
Tonight is the last night it's gonna be around.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:18.039
They're busting it down.
Can you believe it?

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:22.293
Here's the request. There's a group
of guys out there, they got a car club.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:24.379
They more or less own the place.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:26.714
And it's called
the Hollywood Knights.

01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:31.553
Tonight they had a bunch of pledges come down
here to get a request on the radio, right here,

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:34.222
at exactly 2 a.m., and that's
what I'm gonna do for them.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:38.810
I can't think of a better way to end
this show on this Halloween night, 1965,

01:21:38.978 --> 01:21:42.689
than with Martha & The Vandellas
talking about "Heat Wave."

01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:51.906
Look, the little
sons of bitches made it.

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:53.616
Kiss my ass.

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:14.637
See you in spring.

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:18.641
Look out after
my old lady, huh?

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:25.440
Listen, I'm doing the right thing.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.193
Be careful, huh?

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:39.495
Take care of yourself.
Don't forget to write.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:49.964
You all right?
Yeah.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:56.846
I'm a little scared.
Hell, who isn't?

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.022
You've been like a dad to me.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:12.570
Hey, listen,

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.323
I don't want you
hot-rodding any jeeps.

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.455
That's Dee Dee.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.752
I gotta go.

01:23:35.184 --> 01:23:37.095
Take care.

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:39.263
Hey, I'll send you
those magazines.

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:50.525
Hey, Wheatly.

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:52.860
Halloween's over.

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.446
Why don't you take off the mask?
What?

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:58.199
Why don't you
bite my weenie, chump?

01:23:58.409 --> 01:24:01.703
I don't know what's gonna be.
Soon I'll be going away to college.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.913
I'll probably never see you again.

01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:06.833
Hey, you're going
to UCLA.

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:13.756
Hello?
Hello, Mother?

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:15.299
This is Dudley.
Dudley!

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:19.053
Mother, I'm calling to inform you that
I'm going to be out rather late tonight.

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:23.057
You're not in bed, dear?
In fact, I might not be home at all.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:27.353
Mother, I have an assignation
with a young lady tonight.

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:30.857
I am going to explore
the boundaries of my manhood.

01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:34.444
I see, dear.
Mother, I'm going to get laid.

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:36.529
You're going to be a little late.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:40.241
Not late, Mother. Laid. L-A-I-D.

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:45.455
The past participle of the verb "to lay."
I'm going to screw someone.

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:52.295
Now I've got to find out how.

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:02.054
Excuse me.
Honey, are you okay?

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.557
I got a little heartburn.

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:08.436
You know, I think that somebody
did put something in that punch.

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:11.606
There was something in it.
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:16.152
Now I feel a little funny myself.
That taste keeps coming up.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:27.288
Let's go, pretty boy.

01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:30.750
I guess we finally got rid
of those little pissants.

01:25:30.918 --> 01:25:35.046
You bet. We really whupped
their ass tonight.

01:25:38.008 --> 01:25:39.467
Bimbeau!

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.761
Kiss his ass!

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:44.514
Bullshit!

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:48.100
Look out.

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:53.022
It's okay. It's okay.

01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:55.233
Honey, I don't feel safe here.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.236
Your husband is right
in that house. Right there.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:01.656
Don't worry about a thing.
He's dead drunk. He's passed out.

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:04.992
It'd take an earthquake to wake
him up. Don't worry about him.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.078
Don't worry about anything.
I'm not.

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:09.872
Don't worry.
I don't even care anymore.

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:20.424
Rock 'n' roll!
Rock 'n' roll!

01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:28.015
Get out! It might explode!

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:31.435
That son of a bitch
hit this son of a bitch.

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:34.105
Clark! You're supposed
to be riding shotgun!

01:26:34.273 --> 01:26:36.858
You're supposed to look out for me!
I'm looking!

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:42.196
Jacqueline? Bob?
Jack...

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:47.076
Honey, the strangest thing
just happened!

01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:48.953
We were talking and...

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:51.163
They knocked my pants off,
and...

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:53.791
I'm going for the police
now and...

01:26:54.001 --> 01:26:57.211
We were just... -
We were talking in the car.

01:26:57.421 --> 01:27:00.339
Don't just stand there!
Do something!

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:03.634
I can't believe that this shit
has happened to me tonight.

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:05.469
Mrs. Friedman!

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:08.097
You assholes!
