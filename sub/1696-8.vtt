00:09.912 --> 00:12.210

00:56.391 --> 01:00.623
- So, what'd you think?
- Those pajamas are so cute.

01:00.696 --> 01:03.460
- I was talking about the song.
- Oh.

01:03.532 --> 01:05.932
Love that, too, but I can't wear it.

01:06.001 --> 01:08.834
When we're at the mall tomorrow,
I wanna get something cool to wear.

01:08.904 --> 01:12.738
Oh, I forgot. Publicity thing.
What about Saturday?

01:12.808 --> 01:16.175
Saturday, Saturday, can't!
Laker game with my dad.

01:16.245 --> 01:18.941
- How about Sunday?
- Yeah, I think I... Can't.

01:19.014 --> 01:22.245
Costume fitting Sunday morning.
What about Sunday afternoon?

01:22.317 --> 01:24.285
No, 3:00 dinner with my grandparents.

01:24.353 --> 01:28.050
I love them,
but they smell like oat... meal.

01:28.123 --> 01:29.920
Oh, I love the smell of oatmeal.

01:29.992 --> 01:33.758
Not when it's mixed with mouthwash
and my grandmother's BO.

01:33.829 --> 01:35.319
- This is crazy.
- What?

01:35.397 --> 01:38.195
We haven't had any Miley-Lilly time
in, like, forever.

01:38.267 --> 01:39.427
I know, I miss it, too.

01:39.501 --> 01:41.332
Then how about Tuesday after school?

01:41.403 --> 01:45.772
Sounds perfect, but I'm trying out
for cheer... leading squad.

01:45.841 --> 01:48.139
Oh, hey, why don't you try out with me?

01:48.210 --> 01:49.609
Cheerleading?

01:49.678 --> 01:53.478
Give me an N! Give me an O!
What's that spell? "No. "

01:54.616 --> 01:56.777
Yeah, no time together.

01:56.852 --> 02:00.015
Come on. You can get this!
We won't regret this!

02:00.088 --> 02:02.682
We'll be together! Best friends forever!

02:02.758 --> 02:04.988
When you cheer this way,
I have to say, "Okay. "

02:05.060 --> 02:08.757
I know you must be right,
but now I have stage fright.

02:13.635 --> 02:16.536
- Say good night, Lola.
- Good night, Lola!

02:16.605 --> 02:18.163
Bye.

02:23.712 --> 02:25.339
<i> Come on!</i>

02:25.414 --> 02:29.373
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:29.451 --> 02:32.943
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

02:33.021 --> 02:36.923
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

02:36.992 --> 02:41.759
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

02:41.830 --> 02:44.890
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

02:44.967 --> 02:50.496
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:50.572 --> 02:54.338
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:54.409 --> 02:56.468
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:56.545 --> 02:58.206
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:58.280 --> 03:02.546
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:02.617 --> 03:04.107
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:04.186 --> 03:07.417
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:15.130 --> 03:17.394
Hi, Dad, is the sink still clogged?

03:17.466 --> 03:20.458
No, Son,
I unclogged the sink hours ago,

03:20.535 --> 03:22.833
now I'm just working on my triceps.

03:24.239 --> 03:25.604
Well, here, let me help.

03:25.674 --> 03:27.198
- Really?
- Sure.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.802
If you lean into it like this,
you get your deltoids, too.

03:32.447 --> 03:35.575
Maybe I'll just bench press you
out the window.

03:35.650 --> 03:39.643
Are you working on your pecs
or your delts? Make up your mind!

03:39.721 --> 03:41.848
Oh, heck with this,
I'm already late for a meeting.

03:41.923 --> 03:44.289
I'm just gonna call the plumber.
Can't believe it.

03:44.359 --> 03:47.624
Drain's already clogged, now
I'm gonna throw $80 an hour down it.

03:47.696 --> 03:51.496
Plumbers make $80 an hour?
I'll do it for $50.

03:51.566 --> 03:55.195
You know what? I'm so late, I'm gonna
take you up on that little deal.

03:55.270 --> 03:57.465
Wait a minute, if I would've known
you were gonna cave that fast,

03:57.539 --> 03:59.769
I would've asked for, like, $60.

03:59.841 --> 04:01.832
And I was willing to give you $ 75.

04:01.910 --> 04:02.899
Oh!

04:05.280 --> 04:07.612
All right, here we go.

04:10.452 --> 04:11.714
Wait a minute.

04:11.787 --> 04:14.620
If I'm gonna be a plumber,
I'm gonna do this right.

04:16.825 --> 04:20.420
Oh, yeah, that breeze feels nice.

04:21.997 --> 04:24.363
Quickest 50 bucks I'll ever make.

04:35.944 --> 04:39.971
Oh, man, I hated that
broccoli casserole the first time.

04:45.387 --> 04:48.254
We've got pride on our side!

04:48.323 --> 04:51.918
You know it! We show it!
We've got pride!

04:51.993 --> 04:56.726
Okay, so, that's the pride cheer,
with optional herkie. Any questions?

04:56.798 --> 04:58.197
A couple.

04:58.266 --> 05:00.860
First, what the heckie is a "herkie"?

05:01.803 --> 05:05.239
And second,
if one of these is a pom-pom,

05:05.307 --> 05:08.708
does that make two of them
pom-pom-pom-poms?

05:10.112 --> 05:12.580
These are the questions that haunt me.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.939
- Show me what you got.
- Okay.

05:15.016 --> 05:16.176
Go ahead.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.245
Go team, throw the ball!

05:21.323 --> 05:24.087
Go team, to the mall!

05:25.327 --> 05:27.887
Lilly, we're doing this
to spend time together.

05:27.963 --> 05:31.296
That's not gonna happen
if I'm on the team and you're not.

05:31.366 --> 05:34.164
Okay, so just watch me, all right?

05:34.236 --> 05:36.830
And one, two, three, four.

05:36.905 --> 05:39.373
Move and squat, arms up and jump.

05:39.441 --> 05:41.671
Twirl, clap, arms up and jump.

05:41.743 --> 05:44.007
- Okay, now you try.
- Okay.

05:45.013 --> 05:50.451
Move and squat and arms
and jump and clap and arms

05:50.519 --> 05:52.919
and twirl and twirling and twirling and...

05:55.924 --> 05:57.186
How's that?

05:57.259 --> 05:59.625
Now why is it that
when I ended up on the couch like that

05:59.694 --> 06:01.059
you grounded me for a week?

06:01.129 --> 06:04.462
That's because you jumped
all the way from the piano.

06:05.133 --> 06:08.967
Sixteen feet,
a new personal best, baby!

06:09.037 --> 06:11.767
So, I'm guessing you're going to be
the only cheerleader there

06:11.840 --> 06:13.933
with pom-poms and a helmet.

06:15.477 --> 06:16.603
Help.

06:20.282 --> 06:23.251
<i> Hey, come on!</i>

06:23.318 --> 06:25.115
<i>Get out!</i>

06:25.187 --> 06:27.485
<i>I'm snaking out the pipes now</i>

06:27.556 --> 06:30.024
<i>Hey, come on!</i>

06:30.091 --> 06:33.857
- Hey, Jackson, where's Miley?
- Don't know.

06:33.929 --> 06:35.863
- When's she gonna be back?
- Don't care.

06:35.931 --> 06:38.866
- Could you tell her I stopped by?
- Don't count on it.

06:39.901 --> 06:42.131
There, I'm through.

06:44.906 --> 06:47.101
- Jackson?
- Not right now, kid.

06:47.175 --> 06:49.336
I'm about ready to hit pay dirt.

06:50.745 --> 06:52.645
Jackson, turn it off!

06:55.050 --> 06:56.278
Jackson!

06:59.788 --> 07:02.552
Why does this always happen to me?

07:04.993 --> 07:07.655
I was kind of thinking the same thing.

07:13.168 --> 07:16.865
Dominate the floor!
Pirates make that score!

07:16.938 --> 07:20.339
Give it all you got!
Pirates make that shot!

07:22.711 --> 07:25.111
Oh! I can't believe I broke a nail!

07:26.781 --> 07:31.047
Anyway, yay, team!

07:31.119 --> 07:34.680
Amber, that was a wonderful effort.

07:34.756 --> 07:37.884
Every time you fell,
you got right back up again.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.484
Even when I begged you to stay down.

07:41.696 --> 07:44.187
Everyone give it up for the effort.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.091
Okay, moving on.

07:50.338 --> 07:54.206
She doesn't like you 'cause
you're too pretty and you threaten her.

07:54.276 --> 07:56.176
Story of my life!

07:59.281 --> 08:01.681
Okay, Stewart, show me your stuff.

08:02.851 --> 08:03.875
Okay.

08:03.952 --> 08:10.450
They got our ball. We want it back.

08:10.525 --> 08:13.790
- They got our ball.
- You want it back!

08:13.862 --> 08:16.990
- I get it. What else you got?
- Oh, I got a good one.

08:17.065 --> 08:20.398
And slide and slide
and do the butterfly!

08:20.468 --> 08:23.096
And dip and dip
and shake my little hips.

08:23.171 --> 08:26.937
I want you and you
to cheer it with me, too!

08:29.411 --> 08:31.379
Way to go, baby!

08:31.446 --> 08:34.414
When I asked you to bring it,
you brought it.

08:34.482 --> 08:36.313
Now take it over there.

08:37.385 --> 08:40.616
Lilly Truscott, come on down!

08:40.688 --> 08:43.953
You're the next contestant on
<i>The Coach Is Right!</i>

08:48.363 --> 08:50.991
Okay, Truscott, you're the last one.

08:51.066 --> 08:53.534
The next minute of my life is yours.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.660
Don't waste it. Let's go.

08:55.737 --> 08:56.863
Go!

08:59.841 --> 09:03.470
Dominate the floor!
Pirates raise that score!

09:03.545 --> 09:07.413
Give it a shot! Sorry,
I mean...

09:07.482 --> 09:11.919
Give it all you got!
Pirates, take that... Make that shot!

09:11.986 --> 09:14.318
Yay!

09:14.489 --> 09:16.923
Well, wasn't that something?

09:16.991 --> 09:19.186
Can I try something a little different?

09:19.260 --> 09:22.195
Yeah, something different
would be good.

09:22.263 --> 09:26.256
Oh, no, I can't watch this.
I only taught her one cheer.

09:26.334 --> 09:29.826
You might be good at football!
You might be good at track!

09:29.904 --> 09:33.203
But when it comes to basketball,
you might as well step back!

09:33.274 --> 09:35.139
Come on, step back!

09:35.210 --> 09:37.110
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

09:49.424 --> 09:51.119
Wow, where did that come from?

09:51.192 --> 09:53.888
I just did all my skateboarding stunts
without my skateboard.

09:53.962 --> 09:58.023
Well, you know what? Put the
skateboard away and grab a uniform.

09:58.099 --> 09:59.726
You're on the squad!

09:59.801 --> 10:01.291
Yay, yay, yay!

10:01.369 --> 10:04.236
And, Stewart, I love your enthusiasm.

10:04.305 --> 10:05.772
It is part of what makes you perfect

10:05.840 --> 10:09.435
for a position of great responsibility
on this squad.

10:09.511 --> 10:11.411
And I think you know
what I'm talking about.

10:11.479 --> 10:13.470
I think I do.

10:13.548 --> 10:15.675
She's gonna make me
head cheerleader.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.514
Congratulations to our new mascot!

10:18.586 --> 10:20.349
Yeah! Mas-what?

10:20.422 --> 10:24.483
Everyone say hello to Pirate Pete!

10:24.826 --> 10:26.384
Arrr!

10:28.596 --> 10:30.587
Argh?

10:32.233 --> 10:35.464
We're number one, not number two.

10:35.537 --> 10:38.700
We're gonna beat
the "whoops" out of you!

10:41.609 --> 10:45.978
<i>Testing, testing. 555-0121.</i>

10:46.047 --> 10:49.847
<i>555-0121, that's my number, ladies. </i>

10:49.918 --> 10:53.217
<i>And the tenth caller</i>
<i>gets a date with</i> moi.

10:55.824 --> 10:57.985
- Hello, lucky tenth caller.
- Knock it off, Oken!

10:58.059 --> 10:59.549
Sorry, Coach.

11:01.563 --> 11:02.587
Aargh!

11:02.664 --> 11:06.532
I'm a pirate!
Why am I riding a tricycle?

11:06.601 --> 11:09.798
This is not a tricycle,
this is your pirate ship.

11:09.871 --> 11:13.102
Own it, sell it,
make the crowd believe it!

11:14.509 --> 11:16.340
I don't even believe it.

11:16.411 --> 11:20.313
Dominate the floor!
Pirates make that score!

11:20.381 --> 11:24.010
Give it all you got!
Pirates make that shot!

11:26.421 --> 11:28.912
Perfect! Fantastic!

11:28.990 --> 11:30.787
You girls are the best.

11:30.859 --> 11:33.828
There's not a girl in this school
who doesn't wish they were you.

11:35.463 --> 11:36.896
Oh, hi, Stewart.

11:36.965 --> 11:40.230
Coach, I put this on my head
and it smells like a litter box.

11:40.301 --> 11:41.427
Don't worry.

11:41.503 --> 11:44.438
I think I've got something
that might help.

11:44.506 --> 11:47.907
Oh, man, there's gum stuck in here.

11:47.976 --> 11:49.341
Air fresheners!

11:49.410 --> 11:54.109
Do you want to smell like a pine forest,
a tropical breeze or a brand new car?

11:54.883 --> 11:57.283
I wanna smell like a cheerleader.

11:57.752 --> 11:59.344
They don't make that scent.

11:59.420 --> 12:02.821
Now get back out there
and show me a little less Miley

12:02.891 --> 12:05.860
and a lot more pedaling pirate.

12:05.927 --> 12:07.292
Arrr!

12:09.731 --> 12:12.757
I am so glad you talked me into this,
it's a blast.

12:12.834 --> 12:15.803
Oh, yeah, you should see it
from inside here.

12:16.538 --> 12:19.029
And the best part is,
we're back to having Miley-Lilly time.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.334
Gotta go.

12:26.948 --> 12:30.281
I know you feel bad
about not making the squad, but look!

12:30.351 --> 12:31.648
Argh!

12:32.220 --> 12:35.189
See? I told you
it would make you feel better.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.657
Oh, yeah, that's right,
you run from Pirate Pete!

12:38.726 --> 12:41.786
If this thing had a plank,
you'd be walking it!

12:46.868 --> 12:50.167
Hey, Jackson,
Miley left her head at practice.

12:50.238 --> 12:53.901
- You get it? Her head?
- Don't know.

12:53.975 --> 12:56.569
- But I didn't ask that.
- Don't care.

12:56.644 --> 12:59.204
- Will you stop?
- Don't count on it.

13:00.815 --> 13:03.443
- Oh, hey, check this out.
- One sec.

13:05.453 --> 13:06.647
Ready.

13:06.721 --> 13:09.588
Man, it was a little water
and some unidentifiable sludge.

13:09.657 --> 13:12.524
Get a tetanus shot
and buck up, little camper.

13:14.329 --> 13:17.856
- Check it out, it's perfect!
- How did you do that?

13:17.932 --> 13:19.900
I have absolutely no idea.

13:21.102 --> 13:22.831
I did know I had to work fast though.

13:22.904 --> 13:25.998
Went under the house, it was dark,
I got bit by spiders.

13:26.074 --> 13:29.771
Man, I wouldn't be surprised if I wake
up tomorrow with super Spidey powers.

13:31.646 --> 13:33.341
Hey, check this out.

13:41.756 --> 13:46.056
That, sir, was the sweet and sour
sound of $50 going in my pocket.

13:46.127 --> 13:49.528
Jackson!
- What's that sound?

13:51.299 --> 13:55.292
- Jackson!
- Man, I gotta get out of here!

14:01.809 --> 14:03.037
Dang it!

14:09.717 --> 14:11.378
I know that it looks like I messed up,

14:11.452 --> 14:14.080
but technically,
the job was to unclog the sink

14:14.155 --> 14:15.315
and the sink's unclogged.

14:15.390 --> 14:18.689
Now, I do take personal checks,
but I prefer cash.

14:19.827 --> 14:22.557
And I prefer not to shower
in moo shu pork.

14:23.631 --> 14:25.428
And lunch is on me.

14:26.501 --> 14:28.264
And now it's on you.

14:32.006 --> 14:34.998
Oh, no, it's following me.

14:35.076 --> 14:39.206
- Hey, Mile, how's it going?
- I feel like I've been dumped on all day.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.373
Yeah, I know the feeling.

14:42.350 --> 14:44.511
I did this cheerleading thing
to be with Lilly.

14:44.585 --> 14:47.554
And now she's a cheerleader
and I'm a lame pirate.

14:47.622 --> 14:50.682
And, yes, I'm talking to you, stinky.

14:50.758 --> 14:53.386
Whoa, that's a relief.

14:53.461 --> 14:55.759
I thought it was me.

14:55.830 --> 14:58.560
I mean, I don't know what to do.
I'm not having any fun.

14:58.633 --> 15:01.397
- I just wish I could quit.
- Well, then why don't you?

15:01.469 --> 15:02.936
- What?
- I mean, heck,

15:03.004 --> 15:06.770
I don't know any friendship that's worth
wearing a smelly, old pirate head.

15:06.841 --> 15:08.206
The heck with Lilly.

15:08.276 --> 15:10.801
How can you say that?
She's my best friend.

15:10.878 --> 15:13.176
She's more important to me than...

15:13.815 --> 15:16.716
Wait, a minute.
Did you do that on purpose?

15:16.784 --> 15:20.618
- Did what?
- Get all Jedi mind-tricky on me again.

15:24.459 --> 15:26.427
Thanks, Dad.
I'm gonna go take a shower.

15:26.494 --> 15:29.930
Unless you are in the mood
for a moo shu-ey shampoo-ey,

15:29.997 --> 15:31.828
I wouldn't do that.

15:37.438 --> 15:41.898
<i>And your score at halftime,</i>
<i>the Fillmore Flamingos, 58,</i>

15:41.976 --> 15:45.412
<i>and your Seaview Pirates,</i>
<i>less than that. </i>

15:48.716 --> 15:50.741
<i>Way less than that. </i>

15:52.120 --> 15:53.280
<i>But let's not think about that. </i>

15:53.354 --> 15:56.619
<i>Let's think about</i>
<i>your lovely Seaview Pirates!</i>

15:56.691 --> 15:58.318
<i>That's 555-0127.</i>

15:59.494 --> 16:00.688
Go, go!

16:07.935 --> 16:12.998
<i>What's that I hear? Uh-oh!</i>
<i>Cannon fire? It's Pirate Pete!</i>

16:13.074 --> 16:14.507
Argh! Argh!

16:14.575 --> 16:17.738
Let's chop up them
flamingos and feed them to the sharks!

16:17.812 --> 16:20.872
Avast ye landlubbers!
Shiver me timbers!

16:20.948 --> 16:23.542
Shiver your timbers over there.
I can't see the cheerleaders.

16:23.618 --> 16:27.782
Oh, sorry. I mean, sorry, matey.
Backing up!

16:27.855 --> 16:29.686
- Whoa!
- Hey.

16:30.691 --> 16:33.125
You're paying for that popcorn,
you fat headed freak!

16:33.194 --> 16:36.493
- Shove off, matey!
Hey, stop it, I...

16:38.132 --> 16:40.362
No, not my soundboard!

16:44.906 --> 16:47.932
Sorry, Oliver!
- What are you doing?

16:48.009 --> 16:52.036
A mascot never takes off her head,
it ruins the illusion.

16:52.680 --> 16:56.116
What illusion?
I'm a pirate on a pink tricycle.

16:57.151 --> 17:01.281
Look, just stay on the sidelines
and watch the pretty cheerleaders.

17:05.926 --> 17:08.487
Take a hike, Pinky. I'm not in the mood.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.328
I said back off!

17:13.401 --> 17:15.335
Bring it on, birdie!

17:16.270 --> 17:18.602
Why, you little... Hey, stop it!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.236
Oh, I'm gonna get you for that.

17:24.512 --> 17:27.640
Hey, no pecking!
How do you think I got this eye patch?

17:30.685 --> 17:33.654
I'm sorry, Coach. I was just trying
to be the best mascot I could be.

17:33.721 --> 17:37.020
And I think you were,
that's what's so sad.

17:37.091 --> 17:39.286
But I'll be better next time.

17:41.028 --> 17:43.997
- There won't be a next time, will there?
- Listen, sweetie,

17:44.065 --> 17:47.694
some people just aren't meant
to perform in front of crowds.

17:47.768 --> 17:50.999
What I'm trying to say is,
Beyoncé you're not.

17:51.072 --> 17:52.801
Turn in your head.

17:53.774 --> 17:56.004
But have it dry cleaned first.

17:58.646 --> 18:01.206
- Hey, what happened?
- I got fired.

18:01.782 --> 18:04.273
I'm sorry, Lilly.
I really wanted this to work out,

18:04.352 --> 18:07.913
but we can find something else
we can do together. Come on.

18:07.989 --> 18:10.787
What do you mean, "come on"?
I have to go back out and cheer.

18:10.858 --> 18:13.622
Why would you go back out
if I'm not here?

18:13.694 --> 18:16.185
Because... Well, I like it.

18:16.797 --> 18:19.698
But we only did this
so we could be together.

18:19.767 --> 18:23.066
That's before I saw
how cute I look in this uniform.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.300
So a uniform's more important
than our friendship?

18:26.374 --> 18:27.568
No, but...

18:28.776 --> 18:31.677
Miley, can we not do this right now?
I have a big herkie coming up!

18:31.746 --> 18:34.271
You didn't even know what a herkie
was until I taught it to you.

18:34.348 --> 18:35.679
Truscott!

18:35.750 --> 18:38.878
- Look, I gotta go.
- Well, so do I.

18:54.235 --> 18:58.501
Well, Mr. Stewart,
you are one lucky man.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.905
I'd feel a lot luckier
if I was talking to your face.

19:03.177 --> 19:05.975
Oops, sorry. Was I showing again?

19:07.181 --> 19:10.878
You get so used to the breeze,
you can't even tell anymore.

19:10.952 --> 19:12.385
I know what you mean.

19:12.453 --> 19:15.013
Your main line was so rusted,

19:15.089 --> 19:17.580
you were one flush away
from flooding the place.

19:17.658 --> 19:21.822
But the work this boy did
held it all together till I got here.

19:21.896 --> 19:25.195
Now, wait a minute, are you
talking about my son, Jackson?

19:25.266 --> 19:27.734
- Yeah.
- This boy right here, my son?

19:27.802 --> 19:32.296
Yeah, he didn't screw up,
he saved this place.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.669
- This boy did?
- Yes!

19:35.843 --> 19:37.970
- Jackson?
- Yes!

19:38.412 --> 19:41.575
Son, you've got the plumber's gift.

19:42.683 --> 19:46.346
My boy had it,
but he decided to go to college.

19:47.488 --> 19:49.956
Kids, they'll break your heart.

19:52.460 --> 19:55.395
Well, I guess
someone owes someone an apology.

19:55.463 --> 19:57.397
And 50 bucks?

19:57.465 --> 19:58.591
You're right, Jackson,

19:58.666 --> 20:03.399
I never thought I'd ever say this,
but good job, Son, I'm proud of you.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.975
"Good job, Son, good job.

20:09.043 --> 20:11.841
"Thanks, Jackson. "
You're welcome, Dad.

20:11.912 --> 20:15.678
Yeah, I could get used to this
'cause I didn't screw up.

20:15.750 --> 20:19.618
I didn't screw up. I didn't screw up.
I didn't screw up!

20:27.828 --> 20:32.094
Jackson, what was that?
- Nothing!

20:34.802 --> 20:37.134
It's time for my Spidey escape.

20:40.808 --> 20:43.538
Dang it, I gotta get these things fixed.

20:48.716 --> 20:52.550
- Okay, now I'm ready to talk.
Well, now I can't.

20:52.620 --> 20:56.078
Hannah Montana has a backstage
party at the Stones concert.

20:56.157 --> 20:57.215
Why are you limping?

20:57.291 --> 20:59.521
Because, thanks to you,
I couldn't concentrate,

20:59.593 --> 21:01.288
and my herkie was jerky.

21:02.263 --> 21:04.026
Wow, that looks swollen.
Do you want some ice?

21:04.098 --> 21:05.861
Don't you be nice to me
when I'm mad at you!

21:05.933 --> 21:08.800
And, yes, wrapped in a towel.

21:08.869 --> 21:10.996
Can you still cheer?
- It doesn't matter anyway,

21:11.072 --> 21:13.768
- I'm gonna quit.
- What? You can't!

21:13.841 --> 21:16.969
What are you talking about?
You're the one who told me I should.

21:17.044 --> 21:20.036
Well, I was being selfish.

21:20.114 --> 21:22.639
When I'm on stage performing,
and I look out to the wings

21:22.716 --> 21:25.412
and you're always right there
cheering me on.

21:25.486 --> 21:27.545
Well, I just want to do
the same thing for you.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.680
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:29.757 --> 21:31.349
But I can't do that if you quit.

21:31.425 --> 21:34.553
But if I don't quit, we'll never get
any Miley-Lilly time together.

21:34.628 --> 21:37.153
And, I mean, it's not like
you can quit being Hannah Montana.

21:37.231 --> 21:38.493
No.

21:40.734 --> 21:44.033
- But sometimes I can, like tonight.
- What're you doing?

21:44.105 --> 21:47.074
I'm about to limp to the mall
with my friend, Lilly.

21:47.141 --> 21:50.167
You're gonna give up
the Rolling Stones concert for me?

21:50.244 --> 21:53.702
Please, those guys'll still be touring
when they're 90!

21:54.281 --> 21:56.146
I thought they were 90.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.891
That's great! You're on the squad!

22:14.101 --> 22:16.797
Did you hear that, ladies?
Smokin' Oken's on the squad.

22:16.871 --> 22:17.929
Gross.

22:18.005 --> 22:21.202
Now you really have something
to cheer about.

22:21.275 --> 22:23.743
Come on, it's not that bad!

22:23.811 --> 22:24.971
Is it?
