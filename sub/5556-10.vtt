00:01.500 --> 00:03.090
I told you it'd work!

00:03.140 --> 00:04.970
It very nearly ate you for dinner.

00:05.020 --> 00:07.450
Oh, admit it. I totally saved your life.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.700
It wasn't going to eat me.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.890
I totally saved you from

00:11.940 --> 00:14.810
having to marry that giant
sentient plant thing.

00:14.860 --> 00:18.260
That bit where I jumped over
the side? That was amazing!

00:19.660 --> 00:21.330
Hah! I knew you were impressed!

00:21.380 --> 00:24.130
The second most beautiful
garden in all of time and space,

00:24.180 --> 00:27.290
and we can never come back here
because you, Miss Oswald, decided...

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:46.540 --> 00:47.690
Hello?

00:47.740 --> 00:49.850
'Clara? Finally. It's Rigsy.'

00:49.900 --> 00:52.330
Oh. Rigsy. Hey. What's wrong?

00:52.380 --> 00:54.420
So I have this, er...

00:55.500 --> 00:57.900
It kind of looks like a tattoo.

01:00.140 --> 01:03.010
'Seriously? I gave you this
number for emergencies.'

01:03.060 --> 01:05.810
It's an emergency, trust me. Just...

01:05.860 --> 01:08.050
'Come and take a look at it. Please.'

01:08.100 --> 01:10.330
Who said you could give out my number?

01:10.380 --> 01:12.410
Look, look, no matter how bad it is,

01:12.460 --> 01:16.220
we cannot take you back down your
timeline just to fix a tattoo.

01:17.300 --> 01:20.570
That's just it. I didn't
get a tattoo. And it's...

01:20.620 --> 01:22.610
It's counting down.

01:22.660 --> 01:24.250
Sorry, what?

01:24.300 --> 01:28.050
The tattoo -- it's a number and
it's counting down to zero.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.970
Hang tight. We'll be right there.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.740
Hurry. Please.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.160
- Did you make this human?
- Lucy? Yeah, she's mine.

02:22.700 --> 02:26.050
Hello. Oh, Rigsy, she's gorgeous.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.810
She's better than that. She's brilliant.

02:29.860 --> 02:33.460
- What are you doing running round
getting tattoos when there's... - Shh!

02:35.100 --> 02:36.890
Look, I didn't "get" anything.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.970
I woke up this morning and it
was just there. Jen noticed it.

02:40.020 --> 02:43.020
OK, show me this tattoo
you didn't get, then.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.450
It's a tattoo. It's very boring.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.690
No, wait. Just keep watching.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.490
What were you doing last night?

02:52.540 --> 02:55.540
That's just it -- yesterday
was a total blank.

02:56.460 --> 03:00.010
Jen said I left the house
before dawn, I missed work,

03:00.060 --> 03:03.620
and I didn't get back till after
midnight. No-one saw me all day.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.100
Oh, that's not boring.

03:09.660 --> 03:11.980
That is very not boring.

03:13.980 --> 03:16.450
What? What is it?

03:16.500 --> 03:20.780
OK, Local Knowledge, you're coming
with us. Bring the new human.

03:21.820 --> 03:25.620
No! Don't bring the new human.
I'll just get distracted.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.330
If you want your extremities
to stay attached,

03:31.380 --> 03:32.730
stand absolutely still.

03:32.780 --> 03:36.300
If not, we can provide a small bag,
you can take them home at the end.

03:37.460 --> 03:39.260
Rigsy, your phone.

03:40.180 --> 03:42.890
It's like they've wiped
it, but only the last day.

03:42.940 --> 03:46.410
No location data, no texts, nothing.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.410
You're sure the screen wasn't
cracked before yesterday?

03:49.460 --> 03:50.490
Mm-hm.

03:50.540 --> 03:54.010
Oh, right, OK, here we go. Ah...

03:54.060 --> 03:55.730
Good.

03:55.780 --> 03:57.050
Weird.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.330
Good and weird.

03:58.380 --> 03:59.570
Can I...?

03:59.620 --> 04:02.260
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.

04:04.020 --> 04:05.560
First off...

04:06.380 --> 04:07.770
.. in the last 24 hours,

04:07.820 --> 04:10.770
you've had significant
contact with alien life-forms,

04:10.820 --> 04:12.770
right here in the centre of London.

04:12.820 --> 04:15.770
OK, so why don't I remember anything?

04:15.820 --> 04:18.370
- You've been retconned.
- Huh? - What-conned?

04:18.420 --> 04:22.380
Amnesia drug. Your pre-frontal
cortex is marinating in it.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.100
Oh, there's something else!

04:26.740 --> 04:28.280
Something...

04:31.620 --> 04:33.130
Er...

04:33.180 --> 04:34.930
not good.

04:34.980 --> 04:36.380
Weird.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.240
What's he doing?

04:55.180 --> 04:57.330
He's making an effort to be nice.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.490
There is no nice way to
say you're about to die.

05:00.540 --> 05:01.820
What?!

05:06.780 --> 05:10.330
- Rigsy... - No, no, no, no, don't
start using my actual name now!

05:10.380 --> 05:13.090
Call me Pudding Brain, call
me Local Knowledge, whatever.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.930
Just don't call me Rigsy.

05:14.980 --> 05:18.860
You're going to save me. You're
a doctor. That's what you do.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.170
OK. OK...

05:31.220 --> 05:34.290
Yes, OK, let's do this thing.

05:34.340 --> 05:36.730
First up, stop the countdown.

05:36.780 --> 05:40.090
526 minutes, right! OK.

05:40.140 --> 05:44.530
Yes, you know what, Local Knowledge,
I don't know who did this to you

05:44.580 --> 05:47.450
or why. But I do almost certainly know...

05:48.460 --> 05:50.400
.. how to find them.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.130
There have always been rumours.

06:00.180 --> 06:02.450
Stories passed from
traveller to traveller,

06:02.500 --> 06:04.570
mutterings about hidden streets,

06:04.620 --> 06:07.050
secret pockets of alien life

06:07.100 --> 06:08.850
right here on Earth.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.530
Like a smuggler's cove, only not
a cove, because it's right here.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.250
Right in the middle of the capital.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.930
- The hidden places are in the
Great British Library? - No.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.580
The maps are.

06:20.220 --> 06:21.890
I never put stock in it.

06:21.940 --> 06:25.290
London streets that suddenly
disappeared from human view? No.

06:25.340 --> 06:28.250
You lot are always overlooking
things, but whole streets?

06:28.300 --> 06:30.610
That would be excessive, even for you.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.490
If the stories are true,
though, there should be a street

06:33.540 --> 06:36.850
on one of these old maps that no
longer exists in the real world.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.240
Like a trap street, only not.

06:39.980 --> 06:42.610
- What did you say?
- A trap street.

06:42.660 --> 06:45.930
You know, when someone's making
a map, a, um... cartographer,

06:45.980 --> 06:47.970
uses a fake street,
throws it into the mix,

06:48.020 --> 06:51.210
names it after one of his kids or
whatever. Then if the fake street,

06:51.260 --> 06:53.610
the trap street, ever shows
up on someone else's map,

06:53.660 --> 06:56.010
they know their work's
been stolen. Clever, right?

06:56.060 --> 06:58.610
My God. A whole London
street just up and disappeared

06:58.660 --> 07:00.890
and you lot assume it's
a copyright infringement.

07:00.940 --> 07:03.010
So we're looking for a trap street?

07:03.060 --> 07:06.050
We're looking for a trap street and
we're not going to find it here.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.650
The glasses are tracking
your eye movements.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.010
Just keep looking straight down and...

07:11.060 --> 07:14.860
I know! Focus on the
buildings directly below me.

07:16.700 --> 07:20.450
Whatever they're using, it
only hides the street itself.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.850
It prevents you from noticing
there's even something missing.

07:23.900 --> 07:26.610
They're somehow making our
eyes skate right over it.

07:26.660 --> 07:29.330
Let's call it a misdirection circuit.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.250
Clara!

07:42.980 --> 07:44.780
Hello, London!

07:53.700 --> 07:55.100
I'm good.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.610
I'm good.

07:57.660 --> 08:00.810
She enjoyed that... way too much.

08:00.860 --> 08:04.340
Tell me about it. It's
an ongoing problem. Here.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.450
Keep it steady.

08:08.380 --> 08:11.450
Just move it slowly over the grid.
When we're done, we'll have a map

08:11.500 --> 08:15.100
of the areas of the grid
that Clara couldn't focus on.

08:16.540 --> 08:19.540
So, these are the bits
my eyes skated over.

08:20.580 --> 08:23.610
OK, we split up. Clara, that way.

08:23.660 --> 08:25.460
Local Knowledge...

08:27.180 --> 08:29.610
Forget the way you
usually look at the world.

08:29.660 --> 08:32.289
This street's going to
be hiding in plain sight.

08:32.340 --> 08:36.049
- 22, 23... - If you see
something unusual or notable,

08:36.100 --> 08:38.440
dismiss it. Just keep walking.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.450
But if there's a bit of
London so unremarkable

08:42.500 --> 08:44.690
that you don't even think about it...

08:44.740 --> 08:46.250
stop.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.930
You could very well be standing
right outside a trap street.

08:49.980 --> 08:53.850
- Count everything that you see.
- Four, five, six...

08:53.900 --> 08:56.530
Because when you hit the
area around a trap street,

08:56.580 --> 08:59.180
it's very likely you'll lose count.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.730
79...

09:02.780 --> 09:04.450
80...

09:04.500 --> 09:05.700
81...

09:06.980 --> 09:08.370
.. 82.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.970
- Huh?
- Remember -- 82.

09:11.020 --> 09:12.960
- Come along!
- 82!

09:14.340 --> 09:17.850
You'll lose count because
the misdirection circuit

09:17.900 --> 09:20.330
is creating confusion in your mind.

09:20.380 --> 09:25.130
Details won't add up. Reality
will have glitches in it.

09:25.180 --> 09:28.810
Like when you try to read the same
simple sentence three times over...

09:28.860 --> 09:30.490
One, two, three...

09:30.540 --> 09:33.280
.. and the meaning just won't sink in.

09:36.580 --> 09:37.920
Got ya.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.250
Clara! Clara!

09:46.300 --> 09:47.570
Clara!

09:50.500 --> 09:52.410
It's off this street, I am certain.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.410
We're very close.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.370
We need to distract our other senses.

09:56.420 --> 10:00.180
Clara, go back to the TARDIS.
Pick up all my most annoying stuff.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.290
- What happened to the stuff I asked
you to bring? - Someone called you.

10:20.340 --> 10:22.740
Yesterday, 6am. Blocked number.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.090
She's dead.

10:35.380 --> 10:38.340
What is it? What are you remembering?

10:43.980 --> 10:45.780
Rigsy, what is it?

10:48.500 --> 10:51.180
You can't see it? There!

11:06.140 --> 11:07.810
I see it. You?

11:09.580 --> 11:11.320
50 minutes left.

11:12.180 --> 11:16.340
Hoodie up, Local Knowledge. They
know what you look like in there.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.330
How come I saw it when you guys couldn't?

11:30.380 --> 11:32.250
You were upset, weren't you?

11:32.300 --> 11:34.570
Something slipped through
the retcon memory,

11:34.620 --> 11:39.130
something that took over your
whole mind, something juicy.

11:39.180 --> 11:42.530
So the misdirection circuit
lost its power over you.

11:42.580 --> 11:45.490
Surely people wander in here
all the time, then, distracted,

11:45.540 --> 11:48.940
- on their phones or whatever?
- Perhaps they do...

12:07.500 --> 12:10.060
Three at once. That's new.

12:12.420 --> 12:13.450
Hang about.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.700
This one don't smell human.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.570
Name, species and case for
asylum. Quick as you like.

12:20.620 --> 12:24.460
- Asylum? - The reason you're here.
The reason you need sanctuary.

12:26.940 --> 12:28.770
Why didn't they use the protocol?

12:28.820 --> 12:30.970
I saw through the circuit
again. I saw them.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.890
They're definitely not human.

12:32.940 --> 12:35.780
You do know this is a refugee camp?

12:38.660 --> 12:40.290
Yeah, of course.

12:40.340 --> 12:45.460
- Of course he does! Now that
you've told him. - Mayor Me.

12:47.020 --> 12:49.170
- Ashildr!
- Ashildr?

12:49.220 --> 12:52.930
That's your name. I keep telling you that.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.250
Do you?

12:54.300 --> 12:59.970
Infinite lifespan, finite memory --
it makes for an awkward social life.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.650
You must be Clara Oswald.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.300
You're as beautiful as your photos.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.090
We met.

13:07.140 --> 13:08.930
Yes, I know. It's in my diaries.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.210
Oh, don't look like that! I
enjoyed our conversations.

13:12.260 --> 13:14.130
I've read them many times.

13:14.180 --> 13:17.130
OK, that's... slightly odd. But nice.

13:17.180 --> 13:18.450
Um, hang on,

13:18.500 --> 13:22.530
so this is where you've been.
That's why he lost track of you.

13:22.580 --> 13:26.530
Oh, come on, please. It's really
cute, he thinks I don't know.

13:26.580 --> 13:28.650
He's got this whole
secret room in the TARDIS

13:28.700 --> 13:32.300
- where he collects mentions of you.
- It's not cute.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.490
It's surveillance.

13:34.540 --> 13:37.410
- It's professional interest.
- Precautionary measure.

13:37.460 --> 13:39.490
Still saving the world from me, then?

13:39.540 --> 13:41.330
It's still here, isn't it?

13:41.380 --> 13:44.010
He lost track of you in the early 1800s.

13:44.060 --> 13:47.620
- I wondered if you were...
- Oh, no. I let him know I was OK.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.930
I saw you.

13:51.980 --> 13:54.090
No. I got your attention.

13:54.140 --> 13:57.210
Yes, you did, and you have.
Now we need your help.

13:57.260 --> 14:01.500
Someone in this place is in
control of a Quantum Shade.

14:08.100 --> 14:11.250
- I knew I recognised that smell. - Oh.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.780
Ashildr? What's going on?

14:26.380 --> 14:27.610
You.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.850
How do you know this man?

14:29.900 --> 14:32.300
Hang on. You did this to Rigsy?

14:33.220 --> 14:34.730
What have you done?

14:34.780 --> 14:37.460
This man committed a crime.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.450
- I sentenced him.
- Sentenced him?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.970
I also gave him enough time to return home

14:44.020 --> 14:45.490
and say goodbye to his family.

14:45.540 --> 14:47.130
You flooded his brain with retcon!

14:47.180 --> 14:49.890
Till we showed up, he didn't
even know he had to say goodbye.

14:49.940 --> 14:53.090
I'm afraid no intruder leaves
this place without a memory wipe.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.330
With respect, that will include you.

14:55.380 --> 14:56.850
Oh, the hell it will!

14:56.900 --> 15:00.450
Ashildr, given we're all going to
forget this conversation anyway,

15:00.500 --> 15:03.050
perhaps you could tell us
what happened here yesterday

15:03.100 --> 15:05.570
to necessitate a death sentence?

15:06.580 --> 15:08.740
Fine, I'll show you.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.930
Mr Kabel, Mr Rump.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.450
Permit them entry.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.890
No!

15:15.940 --> 15:18.730
You've already endangered
one of my friends.

15:18.780 --> 15:22.650
I want your personal guarantee
you will not endanger another.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.040
Shut up, I can handle myself.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.690
I guarantee the safety of Clara Oswald.

15:28.740 --> 15:33.410
She will be under my personal
protection. That is absolute.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.800
If that's your wish, Mayor Me.

15:40.180 --> 15:42.530
This way.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.290
Murderer.

15:44.340 --> 15:46.140
What did you say?

15:53.500 --> 15:54.900
Murderer.

15:56.260 --> 15:58.330
He called me a murderer.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.770
So you're still calling yourself Me, then?

16:05.820 --> 16:07.650
- Me?
- Mayor Me.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.730
Mayor is a title. I give myself a
title for the same reason you do,

16:10.780 --> 16:13.850
- Doctor -- something to live up to.
- Difficult, isn't it?

16:13.900 --> 16:16.730
- How long have you been here?
- Since Waterloo.

16:16.780 --> 16:19.930
- The battle?
- No, the station. Really, Doctor.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.930
Tread carefully while you're here.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.970
Some of your greatest enemies
are within a few feet of you.

16:25.020 --> 16:28.290
As far as you're concerned, this is
the most dangerous street in London.

16:28.340 --> 16:32.210
Fascinating. Now, can we skip to the part
where you want Rigsy dead for some reason?

16:32.260 --> 16:34.200
It's him! He's back!

16:35.300 --> 16:37.410
It's best we get him inside first.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.450
Murderer. You're not welcome here.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.610
They look at me as if they
want to kill me themselves.

16:42.660 --> 16:45.690
- Don't want your kind round here.
- Murderer!

16:49.540 --> 16:52.210
Like I said, it's best we get inside.

16:56.460 --> 16:58.200
Filthy murderer!

17:06.540 --> 17:08.329
Wait, Clara.

17:08.380 --> 17:09.579
Look.

17:15.420 --> 17:18.579
This misdirection circuit
of yours is remarkable.

17:19.859 --> 17:22.650
The cloaking device that hides the street,

17:22.700 --> 17:24.890
makes everyone look like humans.

17:24.940 --> 17:26.530
It's no device.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.450
It's the Lurkworms.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.330
Quite something, aren't they?

17:31.380 --> 17:33.930
The light is a telepathic field.

17:33.980 --> 17:36.450
It normalises everything you see,

17:36.500 --> 17:41.020
places it within the compass of
your expectations, your experiences.

17:43.780 --> 17:46.180
You can bypass them, of course.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.260
Ow!

17:58.060 --> 18:00.600
Don't worry. We're perfectly safe.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.570
Yes, a phrase I find
is usually followed by

18:03.620 --> 18:06.170
a lot of screaming and
running and bleeding.

18:06.220 --> 18:11.130
I brokered a truce. We have strict
rules against violence here.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.770
Rules every creature must abide by

18:12.820 --> 18:14.610
if they wish to remain on the street.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.170
- Get away from us!
- Don't want your kind round here.

18:17.220 --> 18:21.050
What's better, that they're in here
with me, peaceful and cooperative,

18:21.100 --> 18:23.290
or out there on Earth like the Zygons?

18:23.340 --> 18:26.330
We haven't had an act of violence
on this street for 100 years,

18:26.380 --> 18:29.050
until yesterday, when
your friend here attacked

18:29.100 --> 18:31.330
one of our most vulnerable residents.

18:31.380 --> 18:33.580
How did Rigsy even get in?

18:35.060 --> 18:38.900
I mean, we barely managed it, and
we knew what we were looking for...

18:41.180 --> 18:44.180
She was found at the
entrance of the street.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.290
No weapon on the scene,

18:47.340 --> 18:49.930
but the cause of death
is likely the head wound.

18:49.980 --> 18:52.850
- Seems she was knocked to
the cobblestones. - "Seems"?

18:52.900 --> 18:55.050
You've sentenced Rigsy to death

18:55.100 --> 18:57.650
yet you don't know
exactly what's going on?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.690
He was found over the body.

18:59.740 --> 19:03.090
My people were angry,
frightened. I had to act.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.570
- This is ridiculous, this is...
- What was her name?

19:05.620 --> 19:07.090
Anah.

19:07.140 --> 19:10.700
We're keeping her here until someone
can take her home for burial.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.730
She's a Janus!

19:14.660 --> 19:18.170
She escaped slavery. She
fled here with her child.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.960
- The child. A daughter?
- No. A boy.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.850
Is that bad?

19:22.900 --> 19:25.250
No, it's not bad, it's just unhelpful.

19:25.300 --> 19:28.300
A daughter might've seen
who killed her mother.

19:31.540 --> 19:34.010
The female Janus is psychic.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.090
One face sees into the future,

19:36.140 --> 19:38.770
the other looks behind her, into the past.

19:38.820 --> 19:41.050
I think we saw her son outside.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.090
Clara, what if I did do it?

19:44.140 --> 19:48.050
I mean, I wouldn't have
meant to hurt her, but...

19:48.100 --> 19:50.570
What if I wandered in and saw
what she really looked like?

19:50.620 --> 19:52.010
What if I freaked?

19:52.060 --> 19:54.370
You didn't just wander in here.

19:54.420 --> 19:58.130
You were called here at 6am by
a number from a mystery phone.

19:58.180 --> 20:00.730
There is no way you did this.

20:00.780 --> 20:04.930
So, what then? You think someone
called him here? Set him up?

20:04.980 --> 20:06.810
- Yes!
- [Mayor!]

20:06.860 --> 20:08.370
Obviously! Which means

20:08.420 --> 20:11.010
one of your pet aliens out
there is the real killer.

20:11.060 --> 20:14.690
- I just need to talk to her.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

20:14.740 --> 20:18.610
Yes. Please, go. It's not like we've
got a ticking clock or anything.

20:18.660 --> 20:20.530
Mayor, I beg of you, please...

20:20.580 --> 20:21.850
41 minutes.

20:21.900 --> 20:26.610
Lock me up, throw us
out, anything but this.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.820
Please. I only took it to save her.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.380
How many minutes left?

20:36.100 --> 20:37.900
Two, Madam Mayor.

20:43.180 --> 20:46.210
This man stole medical rations.

20:46.260 --> 20:50.170
He broke a rule of the street
and he stole from all of you.

20:50.220 --> 20:53.740
And yes, I can remove the chronolock.

20:55.180 --> 20:56.720
But I won't.

20:57.700 --> 21:00.140
Our rules keep us safe.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.570
Give it to me.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.490
Please.

21:07.540 --> 21:10.650
Tell me I can have it. One word. Say it.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.850
Say yes.

21:12.900 --> 21:16.980
I did this to save you,
you silly old thing.

21:18.420 --> 21:21.180
You really think I could lose you now?

21:27.060 --> 21:29.130
What's happening?

21:29.180 --> 21:31.450
It's called a Quantum Shade.
It's kind of a spirit.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.250
Once it's bound to a victim,

21:34.300 --> 21:38.250
you could flee across all of
time and all of the universe,

21:38.300 --> 21:40.370
it would still find you.

21:48.860 --> 21:51.970
Don't run. Stay with her.

21:57.420 --> 21:59.050
Don't go!

21:59.100 --> 22:01.170
Why do they always run?

22:09.620 --> 22:11.490
Help me, somebody, please!

22:11.540 --> 22:14.050
At least give him a merciful death.

22:14.100 --> 22:18.130
Do you think a Cyberman
fears a merciful death?

22:18.180 --> 22:20.170
Help me, please!

22:20.220 --> 22:23.160
Peace on this street depends on one thing.

22:24.140 --> 22:27.980
To break it in any way
is to face the raven.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.650
Please help me!

23:17.980 --> 23:21.340
I have no wish to harm your
friend if he's innocent, Doctor.

23:23.100 --> 23:27.010
Question anyone. Examine the body.

23:27.060 --> 23:30.500
But it's not me you need to
convince of Rigsy's innocence.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.970
It's them.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.770
OK, we split up. Cover more ground.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.450
I'm good cop, you're bad cop.

23:48.500 --> 23:51.170
No, no, we don't have to...
Can I not be the good cop?

23:51.220 --> 23:54.450
- Doctor, we've discussed
this. Your face. - Oh, yes.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.770
Forget about cops. Forget
about finding the real killer.

23:57.820 --> 24:01.090
You heard Ashildr. All we have
to do is persuade these creatures

24:01.140 --> 24:03.480
that it isn't Rigsy. And fast.

24:05.460 --> 24:07.050
Ssh! Ssh!

24:07.100 --> 24:08.770
'She's been like this all day.'

24:08.820 --> 24:11.490
Listen, you be good for your mum, OK?

24:11.540 --> 24:13.730
I'm doing my best to get home to you guys.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.770
- 'She won't stop crying.'
- Yeah, I know.

24:15.820 --> 24:18.690
Yeah, she can probably tell you're upset.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.020
Rump?

24:22.380 --> 24:24.320
It's Rump, isn't it?

24:25.740 --> 24:28.010
That man's wife. She said something.

24:28.060 --> 24:32.210
"Give it to me, tell me I can
have it." What did she mean?

24:32.260 --> 24:34.860
Two ways to survive a Quantum Shade.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.620
The Shade's master
removes the chronolock...

24:39.380 --> 24:42.010
.. or you can give it to someone else.

24:42.060 --> 24:43.610
Give it? You can just...

24:43.660 --> 24:46.570
No, you can't just push it on
someone. It's not that simple.

24:46.620 --> 24:50.180
It has to be taken willingly.
The death's already locked in.

24:51.580 --> 24:55.420
You can pass it on,
but... you can't cheat it.

25:13.980 --> 25:17.890
You're serious? You actually expect
me to give you my death sentence?

25:17.940 --> 25:21.410
Ssh! Go on, I've always wanted a tattoo.

25:21.460 --> 25:24.490
- You know, something small. Discreet.
- Clara. Cut it out.

25:24.540 --> 25:28.010
Weren't you listening? I'm under
the Mayor's personal protection.

25:28.060 --> 25:31.250
And it's absolute, apparently.
Look, she controls the raven,

25:31.300 --> 25:33.690
so I will never have to
face it. This is clever.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.690
But this is putting you in danger.

25:35.740 --> 25:38.410
No, this is us talking the
opposition into their own trap.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.530
This is Doctor 101. We're buying time.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.130
We get all the aliens on our
side in the next half an hour,

25:43.180 --> 25:46.490
and then we reveal I've got the
chronolock, not you, and boom!

25:46.540 --> 25:48.850
We buy ourselves more time
to find the real killer.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.850
The Doctor would never let you do this.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.170
Doctor 102 -- never tell
anyone your actual plan.

25:53.220 --> 25:55.050
He'll have a tantrum when he finds out.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.250
And then, when we confront Ashildr,

25:57.300 --> 26:00.620
she'll want to take the chronolock
off just to shut him up.

26:03.460 --> 26:06.890
What happens if you don't go
home tonight to Jen and Lucy, eh?

26:06.940 --> 26:08.850
If you never go home?

26:08.900 --> 26:11.930
You really want your little
girl growing up without a father

26:11.980 --> 26:14.650
just because he wouldn't take a risk?

26:16.100 --> 26:19.400
You trusted us to save
you, so trust us. Come on.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.100
OK. All right.

26:27.660 --> 26:29.210
How do we do this, then?

26:29.260 --> 26:31.650
Well, I was kind of
hoping that would be it.

26:31.700 --> 26:34.730
I say I want it, you say,
"You can have it" -- done deal.

26:34.780 --> 26:37.120
Hey, turn around, let me see.

26:56.420 --> 27:00.490
So this is your life, then?
Bouncing around time, saving people?

27:00.540 --> 27:02.250
No, not every day.

27:02.300 --> 27:06.010
Sometimes Jane Austen
and I prank each other.

27:06.060 --> 27:08.530
Oh, she is the worst. I love her.

27:08.940 --> 27:11.010
Take that how you like.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.050
Are you sure it wasn't
someone from the street?

27:16.100 --> 27:19.010
I've told you already there wasn't
anyone up that end of the street

27:19.060 --> 27:20.490
except Anah and the human.

27:20.540 --> 27:24.050
I've identified 27 different
species on this street so far,

27:24.100 --> 27:27.050
15 of whom are known for aggression.

27:27.100 --> 27:30.090
Why is it so hard to believe one
of them is capable of murder?

27:30.140 --> 27:34.370
Capable of murder? Yeah.
Capable of killing Anah? No.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.530
Why not? What's so special about her?

27:36.580 --> 27:40.170
It was the way she looked
at you. Like she understood.

27:40.220 --> 27:43.290
One glance into your
past and she felt it all.

27:43.340 --> 27:46.330
Every battle, every loss.

27:46.380 --> 27:48.330
So you just want the
human dead, is that it?

27:48.380 --> 27:49.530
You don't get it, do you?

27:49.580 --> 27:51.810
If the human didn't do it,
that means one of us did it,

27:51.860 --> 27:54.690
which means folks start pointing
fingers, turning on each other,

27:54.740 --> 27:56.850
and once we turn on each
other in here, that's it.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.890
I might as well be back in a war zone.

27:58.940 --> 28:02.610
- So you'll just let Rigsy die?
- To keep the peace? Yeah, I will.

28:02.660 --> 28:06.700
Your friend, acting like he was all
scared of us, calling for a doctor.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.570
- A what?
- I know. The cheek of it!

28:10.620 --> 28:12.730
Humans can survive losing entire limbs

28:12.780 --> 28:15.210
- and I'm supposed to believe he...
- Shut up! Shut up.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.570
The other thing you said,
the second thing -- what,

28:17.620 --> 28:18.970
you said he was scared and...

28:19.020 --> 28:22.250
And he asked the Mayor
to call HIM a doctor.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.570
- Poor Anah, dead at
his feet, and... - Shh!

28:25.620 --> 28:28.050
Did he say "a doctor" or "the doctor"?

28:28.100 --> 28:29.930
This is very, very important.

28:29.980 --> 28:32.770
THE doctor. There was nothing
wrong with him, mind.

28:32.820 --> 28:35.820
It was all just your
standard human lies...

28:41.140 --> 28:43.770
Clara gave you my number for emergencies.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.090
So when you wake up with a
weird tattoo on your neck

28:46.140 --> 28:47.890
and no memory of the last 24 hours

28:47.940 --> 28:50.210
the first thing you do is call the Doctor.

28:50.260 --> 28:51.650
"Call the Doctor."

28:51.700 --> 28:55.130
But you find yourself accused of
murder on a strange alien street

28:55.180 --> 28:57.730
in the middle of London?
Only they've taken your phone

28:57.780 --> 29:00.410
so you beg the woman in
charge to call me instead.

29:00.460 --> 29:04.610
She knew you and I were
friends. So why did she lie?

29:04.660 --> 29:07.860
- Unless she had something to hide.
- Murderer!

29:08.980 --> 29:12.570
There's something very wrong here
and we're running out of time.

29:12.620 --> 29:15.810
There's 12 minutes left.
I'm not giving up yet.

29:15.860 --> 29:18.690
Clara, even if one of
them knows something,

29:18.740 --> 29:21.900
they're not going to come
forward. The way they look at me...

29:23.300 --> 29:24.890
The way they look at you?

29:24.940 --> 29:26.380
What?

29:32.380 --> 29:33.850
Hey. Wait.

29:35.500 --> 29:39.500
Everyone here is weird around us
because of Rigsy. But not you.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.970
You look at me and the
Doctor like you're confused.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.170
Like you're curious.

29:45.220 --> 29:48.290
- I don't know what you mean.
- You do.

29:48.340 --> 29:50.330
You know Rigsy is innocent

29:50.380 --> 29:53.810
because you can look into
his past and you can see it.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.340
Can't you?

30:00.540 --> 30:05.300
She dressed you as a boy to protect
you, but really you're a girl.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.490
You have the gift.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.380
It is no gift. I'm safe as a boy.

30:13.780 --> 30:16.210
This is the first place
I've ever been safe,

30:16.260 --> 30:18.730
and you want me to throw it away?

30:18.780 --> 30:20.250
To admit what I am?

30:20.300 --> 30:22.900
The Mayor -- what is she up to?

30:24.020 --> 30:26.160
It's nothing good, is it?

30:26.580 --> 30:28.720
I can't see everything...

30:30.100 --> 30:33.090
.. but she thinks she's
doing the right thing.

30:33.140 --> 30:34.530
They usually do.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.770
If what Ashildr is doing is harmless,

30:36.820 --> 30:38.970
then we'll just walk out of that door.

30:39.020 --> 30:42.730
No-one will know of your
abilities. But if it's not...

30:42.780 --> 30:45.810
I don't know what she means to do.

30:45.860 --> 30:48.460
No, I'm trying! But I can't see it.

30:49.260 --> 30:52.290
I can't see it because it involves you.

30:52.340 --> 30:56.450
When I look at you, I can't
tell your past from your future,

30:56.500 --> 30:58.970
and there's so very much of both.

31:00.380 --> 31:03.580
This isn't about Rigsy. It's about me.

31:12.220 --> 31:14.660
She couldn't just ask you here.

31:16.540 --> 31:18.170
She needed a mystery.

31:18.220 --> 31:22.130
You can never resist a mystery.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.850
She's afraid.

31:23.900 --> 31:26.780
Afraid of what? Of whom?

31:28.100 --> 31:29.640
I can't see.

31:36.900 --> 31:38.370
I'm sorry.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.900
You! Hold your tongue.
We've got ten minutes left!

31:50.180 --> 31:53.650
Ashildr said Anah was being
taken home for burial.

31:53.700 --> 31:55.850
But the Janus burn their dead.

31:55.900 --> 31:57.500
Is that true?

31:59.100 --> 32:03.010
So, look, Ashildr got it wrong.
What does it matter? Come on!

32:03.060 --> 32:07.560
- There's something about this tech...
- Doctor, we don't have time!

32:07.740 --> 32:08.770
What is it?

32:08.820 --> 32:11.970
It looks like medical data.

32:12.020 --> 32:15.420
But it can't be. She's dead
-- she isn't breathing.

32:15.980 --> 32:18.050
This thing is a stasis pod.

32:18.100 --> 32:21.610
If you're dead, it's a
kind of fancy refrigerator.

32:21.660 --> 32:23.660
But if you're alive...

32:24.500 --> 32:26.530
.. it simply keeps you that way.

32:26.580 --> 32:27.930
She's alive?

32:27.980 --> 32:29.450
She's alive.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.450
Well, get her out! Get her out of there!

32:31.500 --> 32:33.410
There must be a way to unlock it --

32:33.460 --> 32:36.130
- something basic, something
simple I'm missing. - A keyhole!

32:36.180 --> 32:40.850
- A keyhole would be very handy, yes, but...
- No, no, a keyhole! Look!

32:40.900 --> 32:43.010
I'll find her. I'll get the key.

32:43.060 --> 32:45.130
No, Anahson, stay here.

32:46.620 --> 32:49.580
There's a reason the Mayor's gone AWOL.

32:50.700 --> 32:52.690
She means for us to release your mother,

32:52.740 --> 32:55.050
but she doesn't want us to use her key.

32:55.100 --> 32:57.210
She wants to use mine.

32:57.260 --> 33:00.000
The TARDIS? That's what this is about?

33:03.100 --> 33:04.370
Doctor, wait!

33:04.420 --> 33:06.620
This girl needs her mother.

33:06.820 --> 33:07.890
Doctor!

33:07.940 --> 33:09.690
I can't...

33:09.740 --> 33:11.980
What's it doing?

33:17.860 --> 33:19.060
Mum!

33:20.220 --> 33:21.690
Mum? Are you OK?

33:21.740 --> 33:24.330
She'll be perfectly fine in a few moments.

33:24.380 --> 33:25.650
I assure you.

33:25.700 --> 33:28.130
There are easier ways to
steal a key, you know.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.140
I don't want your TARDIS.
That's not what this is about.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.610
Rigsy, come here, I'll
remove your chronolock.

33:35.660 --> 33:38.570
What is this, Ashildr? You can't
possibly think it'll keep me here.

33:38.620 --> 33:40.930
It's not a restraint.

33:40.980 --> 33:43.210
- It's a teleport bracelet.
- What?

33:43.260 --> 33:46.810
I'll give you time to say goodbye.
Don't worry. No-one will be hurt.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.000
Where are you sending me?

33:49.980 --> 33:52.580
I made a deal to protect the street.

33:53.140 --> 33:56.170
They take you, I take the
key so you can't be traced.

33:56.220 --> 33:58.850
I do as they tell me,
and the street is safe.

33:58.900 --> 34:01.290
They? Who are "they?"

34:01.340 --> 34:03.010
One more thing.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.560
Your confession dial.

34:08.260 --> 34:10.969
They have other means of procuring it,

34:11.020 --> 34:14.420
but I understand it's
likely to be on your person.

34:15.380 --> 34:18.650
Please, no resistance.

34:18.699 --> 34:20.639
You've already lost.

34:26.420 --> 34:27.850
What is it?

34:27.900 --> 34:29.889
In your terms, my last will and testament.

34:29.940 --> 34:32.820
- How does it work?
- I've no idea.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.210
Well, thank you anyway.

34:37.020 --> 34:39.770
Rigsy, your neck.

34:39.820 --> 34:43.020
Clara, what are you playing
at? The chronolock!

34:44.380 --> 34:46.610
Take the teleport off him first!

34:46.659 --> 34:49.659
I don't have it, I'm
telling you. Clara does!

34:53.780 --> 34:55.929
No...

34:55.980 --> 34:57.650
No, you didn't.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.890
Go on, then. Take it off.

35:00.940 --> 35:02.880
Clara, you didn't...!

35:06.860 --> 35:09.860
I had no idea she'd do
something so stupid.

35:11.740 --> 35:15.220
I swear, I never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.890
What were you thinking,
sacrificing yourself?

35:19.940 --> 35:21.730
I wasn't sacrificing anything!

35:21.780 --> 35:24.770
It was strategy. backup
plan, to buy us more time.

35:24.820 --> 35:27.890
- Who told you to give it to her?
- Nobody did! I did! Rump said...

35:27.940 --> 35:30.410
- What exactly did Rump say?
- He said the death is locked in.

35:30.460 --> 35:33.010
You can pass it on, but...

35:33.060 --> 35:34.460
But what?

35:37.660 --> 35:39.250
But...

35:39.300 --> 35:41.840
But you can't cheat it altogether.

35:51.740 --> 35:54.650
Clara, you didn't tell me that!

35:54.700 --> 35:56.210
Give it back to me, now.

35:56.260 --> 35:57.730
She can't.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.610
Clara, I made a contract with the Shade

36:02.660 --> 36:05.290
when I put the chronolock on Rigsy.

36:05.340 --> 36:08.330
I promised it a soul and only
I can break that contract.

36:08.380 --> 36:11.450
When you took it from
him, you changed the terms.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.700
You cut me out of the deal.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.180
We can fix this. Can't we?

36:36.580 --> 36:38.380
We always fix it.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.100
No.

36:48.620 --> 36:49.850
But you can.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.610
Fix this. Fix it now.

36:51.660 --> 36:54.930
It... It's not possible. I can't.

36:54.980 --> 36:59.290
Yes, it is, you can, and you will,
or this street will be over.

36:59.340 --> 37:03.370
I'll show you and all your funny little
friends to the whole laughing world.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.250
I'll bring UNIT, I'll bring the Zygons.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.970
Give me a minute, I'll bring
the Daleks and the Cybermen.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.810
You will save Clara,
and you will do it now,

37:10.860 --> 37:13.490
or I will rain hell on
you for the rest of time.

37:13.540 --> 37:14.970
Doctor, stop talking like that.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.970
- You can't.
- I can do whatever the hell I like.

37:18.020 --> 37:20.610
You've read the stories,
you know who I am.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.490
And in all of that time,

37:22.540 --> 37:26.010
did you ever hear anything
about anyone who stopped me?

37:26.060 --> 37:28.530
I know the Doctor. The
Doctor would never...

37:28.580 --> 37:31.580
The Doctor is no longer
here! You are stuck with me.

37:32.620 --> 37:35.290
And I will end you, and
everything you love.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.410
- Doctor, for God's sake,
will you stop? - No!

37:38.460 --> 37:42.290
I did this, do you hear me? I
did this. This was my fault.

37:42.340 --> 37:46.140
- I don't care.
- Liar. You always care. Always have.

37:47.580 --> 37:49.010
Your reign of terror will end

37:49.060 --> 37:52.460
- with the sight of the first crying
child and you know it. - No, I don't.

37:54.580 --> 37:55.980
I do.

38:04.620 --> 38:09.500
Listen... If this is the last
I ever see of you, please...

38:11.460 --> 38:13.260
.. not like this.

38:25.100 --> 38:27.440
Is there anything you can do?

38:28.300 --> 38:31.690
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry, I...

38:31.740 --> 38:34.020
Time's short. Yes or no?

38:35.220 --> 38:36.360
No.

38:50.220 --> 38:52.490
- Well, if Danny Pink can
do it, so can I. - Do what?

38:52.540 --> 38:54.770
Die right. Die like I
mean it. Face the raven.

38:54.820 --> 38:57.170
No, this isn't happening,
this can't be happening.

38:57.220 --> 38:58.650
Maybe this is what I wanted.

38:58.700 --> 39:01.330
Maybe this is it. Maybe
this is why I kept running.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.890
Maybe this is why I kept
taking all those stupid risks.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.730
- Kept pushing it.
- This is my fault.

39:05.780 --> 39:07.890
- This is my choice.
- I let you get reckless.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.650
Why? Why shouldn't I be so reckless?

39:09.700 --> 39:13.090
You're reckless all the bloody
time! Why can't I be like you?

39:13.140 --> 39:15.450
Clara, there's nothing
special about me. I'm nothing

39:15.500 --> 39:18.210
but I'm less breakable than you.
I should have taken care of you.

39:18.260 --> 39:21.760
- I never asked you to.
- You shouldn't have to ask.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.730
- Clara, if I'd known, I'd...
- Don't. Shut up.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.410
- But...
- Really, Rigsy, shut up.

39:28.460 --> 39:32.260
If you feel guilty about this,
even for one minute, I...

39:41.420 --> 39:42.900
You.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.500
Now, you listen to me.

39:49.540 --> 39:53.090
You're going to be alone now,
and you're very bad at that.

39:53.140 --> 39:56.410
You're going to be furious
and you're going to be sad,

39:56.460 --> 39:59.010
but listen to me. Don't
let this change you.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.700
No, listen. Whatever happens next...

40:03.060 --> 40:06.780
.. wherever she is sending you,
I know what you're capable of.

40:08.140 --> 40:11.010
You don't be a warrior.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.850
Promise me.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.620
Be a Doctor.

40:15.860 --> 40:20.010
- What's the point of being a Doctor
if I can't cure you? - Heal yourself.

40:20.060 --> 40:24.420
You have to. You can't let this
turn you into a monster. So...

40:25.700 --> 40:28.980
.. I'm not asking you for a
promise. I'm giving you an order.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.970
You will not insult my memory.

40:34.020 --> 40:35.850
There will be no revenge.

40:35.900 --> 40:40.100
I will die, and no-one else,
here or anywhere, will suffer.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.410
What about me?

40:46.900 --> 40:50.500
If there was something I
could do about that, I would.

40:51.220 --> 40:54.620
I guess we're both just
going to have to be brave.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.740
Clara...

41:05.300 --> 41:08.540
Everything you are about
to say, I already know.

41:10.500 --> 41:14.500
Don't do it now. We've
already had enough bad timing.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.500
Don't run.

41:26.540 --> 41:28.140
Stay with me.

41:31.180 --> 41:32.740
Nah.

41:34.300 --> 41:35.970
You stay here.

41:36.940 --> 41:39.490
In the end, everybody does this alone.

41:39.540 --> 41:44.540
- Clara... - This is as
brave... as I know how to be.

41:48.420 --> 41:51.620
I know it's going to hurt
you, but... please...

41:53.020 --> 41:55.220
.. be a little proud of me.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.800
Goodbye, Doctor.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.530
Let me be brave.

43:00.580 --> 43:02.380
Let me be brave...

44:28.340 --> 44:30.140
I'm sorry, Doctor.

44:31.060 --> 44:32.530
I truly am.

44:47.620 --> 44:50.330
What Clara said about
not taking revenge --

44:50.380 --> 44:52.720
do you know why she said that?

44:53.060 --> 44:55.850
- She was saving you.
- I was lost a long time ago.

44:55.900 --> 44:57.770
She was saving you.

45:01.460 --> 45:06.540
I'll do my best. But I strongly
advise you to keep out of my way.

45:09.020 --> 45:12.740
You'll find it's a very small
universe when I'm angry with you.

46:28.980 --> 46:31.730
This whole place is
designed to terrify me.

46:31.780 --> 46:34.780
I know you. I've seen you before.

46:35.860 --> 46:38.890
If you were any part in killing
her and you're not afraid,

46:38.940 --> 46:41.210
then you understand nothing at all.

46:41.260 --> 46:44.610
