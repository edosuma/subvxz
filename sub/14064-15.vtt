WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.420
You're dying and it's eating me up inside.

00:03.420 --> 00:04.588
So? Are we okay?

00:04.630 --> 00:06.340
You're going off like a dog aren't you?

00:06.340 --> 00:07.214
What do you mean?

00:07.214 --> 00:09.176
When a dog knows it's gonna die he

00:09.176 --> 00:10.510
goes off into the woods by itself.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.503
Denny got engaged.

00:11.503 --> 00:12.461
Who is it this time?

00:12.461 --> 00:13.471
Beverly Bridge.

00:13.506 --> 00:14.688
You think I'm screwing

00:14.688 --> 00:16.309
Denny for his money and power?

00:16.309 --> 00:17.498
It had occurred to me.

00:17.498 --> 00:20.269
I'm prepared to give you $500,000 right now

00:20.304 --> 00:21.876
if you walk away and never have any

00:21.876 --> 00:23.378
contact with Denny Crane ever again.

00:23.378 --> 00:25.630
Bev turned down the offer that I made her.

00:25.630 --> 00:28.022
<i>She was very offended.</i>

00:28.057 --> 00:30.414
<i>This is going to get ugly.</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:55.847
Hello.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.319
Not much going on around here. Is there?

01:09.360 --> 01:10.612
No.

01:10.653 --> 01:14.013
I suppose coming to a lawyer's office
can't be much fun.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.784
Actually, everyone seems friendly here.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.405
Well, they're given
an unlimited supply of donuts.

01:19.405 --> 01:20.872
Here, Sweetheart.

01:22.916 --> 01:23.794
Phyllis?

01:24.232 --> 01:24.958
Alan!

01:24.959 --> 01:26.919
–Hello!
–Hi!

01:26.961 --> 01:29.589
Hello.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.091
I see you have met Marissa.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.801
I have now.

01:34.052 --> 01:38.097
Could we talk in your office?

01:38.139 --> 01:39.849
Of course.

01:39.974 --> 01:44.103
Would you mind watching her
just a little longer? Thanks.

01:44.687 --> 01:48.691
If you get restless, we'll be
right down this hall.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.911
I had a hard time trying to find you.

01:59.952 --> 02:01.704
I called Cruthers, Abbott…

02:01.739 --> 02:03.497
Oh, I was fired. Embezzlement.

02:03.497 --> 02:05.291
Then I tried Young, Frutt and Berlutti…

02:05.291 --> 02:06.375
Oh, yes. That ended badly.

02:06.375 --> 02:09.134
And here you are,
at Crane, Poole and Schmidt.

02:09.169 --> 02:11.088
For now. And you?

02:11.130 --> 02:12.757
Still a legal secretary.

02:12.798 --> 02:15.438
Although the law isn't
as much fun as it was

02:15.461 --> 02:18.596
when I used to watch you bend it.

02:18.637 --> 02:20.806
I need your help.

02:20.848 --> 02:23.684
You used to say that I could
come to you for anything.

02:23.684 --> 02:25.644
I meant sexually.

02:28.169 --> 02:29.237
This is for Marissa.

02:29.237 --> 02:30.701
She's lovely.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.732
But she seems to be having
a bad day though.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.870
Marissa can't smile.

02:36.905 --> 02:41.660
She had nerve damage
from a car accident.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.330
And she had surgery

02:44.413 --> 02:46.957
to try to correct the problem,
but it didn't work.

02:46.957 --> 02:49.793
Alan, she's had a really tough

02:49.828 --> 02:52.629
time of it at the public school.

02:52.671 --> 02:56.133
She's been teased mercilessly.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.593
Here you go. See that?

02:57.634 --> 02:59.761
Now watch this.

03:00.220 --> 03:03.223
It's disappeared. Ha, ha, ha.

03:03.932 --> 03:05.601
What's up your ear?

03:05.642 --> 03:07.436
Ha, ha, ha.

03:09.229 --> 03:11.523
Okay, kid. Let's try it again.

03:11.565 --> 03:15.359
I'm trying to get her into
the Adams Academy for a fresh start.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.864
The admissions director was
so excited to meet her!

03:18.905 --> 03:22.075
Then he met her and she didn't smile.

03:22.110 --> 03:24.077
And that was that.

03:24.119 --> 03:26.463
And these private schools
have become so competitive,

03:26.463 --> 03:29.583
they don't need to let anyone
in who isn't “perfect”.

03:29.583 --> 03:30.966
When I was in school

03:31.001 --> 03:35.861
the closest I ever came to that appellation
was to be called a “perfect” bastard.

03:36.923 --> 03:38.216
I don't wanna sue them,

03:38.216 --> 03:40.469
because if I get known as a litigious parent

03:40.469 --> 03:42.687
I'm never gonna get Marissa into any school.

03:42.687 --> 03:48.268
But I do know that you can be, well…

03:48.310 --> 03:51.062
a perfect bastard.

04:24.345 --> 04:26.014
Denise,

04:26.055 --> 04:27.289
I understand you're going through

04:27.289 --> 04:29.350
some difficulties in your personal life.

04:29.350 --> 04:32.270
Uhm, yeah, It's hard, but I'll get through it.

04:32.353 --> 04:33.604
From what I know about you,

04:33.604 --> 04:34.981
when things get tough you prefer

04:34.981 --> 04:36.154
to bury yourself in your work.

04:36.154 --> 04:39.025
Allow me to provide you with a shovel.

04:40.194 --> 04:43.218
This is Teressa Warner and her daughter Amelia.

04:43.253 --> 04:46.253
Denise is going to be working
with us on the case.

04:46.284 --> 04:48.369
Amelia is eighteen.

04:48.411 --> 04:50.906
She was assaulted
and raped two months ago

04:50.906 --> 04:53.374
and taken to the nearest hospital, St Mary's.

04:53.374 --> 04:55.459
Once we knew she was stable, my

04:55.543 --> 04:57.670
first thought was the morning-after pill.

04:57.670 --> 05:00.593
Only the treating physician
at the hospital told us

05:00.593 --> 05:03.634
that type of treatment
was not available at St Mary's.

05:03.634 --> 05:05.713
He refused to give it to my daughter.

05:05.713 --> 05:09.348
But the Legislature recently
passed a law requiring hospitals

05:09.348 --> 05:11.976
to provide emergency contraception
for rape victims.

05:11.976 --> 05:13.836
They did. But Massachusetts law

05:13.894 --> 05:15.730
also contains a conscience clause.

05:15.730 --> 05:17.648
Catholic hospitals don't have to administer

05:17.648 --> 05:19.108
any treatments that conflicts

05:19.108 --> 05:20.484
with their religious principles,

05:20.484 --> 05:22.439
emergency contraception included.

05:22.439 --> 05:26.159
As soon as she was discharged
we went to our family doctor but

05:26.983 --> 05:30.385
he told us it was too late to prescribe it.

05:30.386 --> 05:34.340
It needs to be administered
as soon as possible,

05:34.375 --> 05:38.294
but no later than seventy-two hours after the…

05:38.377 --> 05:40.671
I know this is difficult for both of you.

05:40.671 --> 05:43.731
Amelia, you've been through
so much trauma already.

05:44.729 --> 05:46.802
So. We'll begin by pursuing a

05:46.885 --> 05:48.191
settlement with the hospital.

05:48.191 --> 05:49.314
No!

05:49.730 --> 05:52.975
No. I want the public to know.

05:53.058 --> 05:55.054
I was raped. And now I'm pregnant

05:55.089 --> 05:57.366
because the doctor wouldn't give

05:57.401 --> 05:59.643
me the contraceptive to prevent it.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.194
I want a trial.

06:20.752 --> 06:22.587
Where is he?

06:23.297 --> 06:25.582
Denny, are you sure we can count on him?

06:25.582 --> 06:26.760
Brad's the best.

06:27.060 --> 06:29.245
I just made him partner.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.430
Well, I want reassurance.

06:31.888 --> 06:34.161
He served in the Gulf War.

06:34.196 --> 06:36.462
The one that turned out okay.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.160
He was top of his class at

06:38.195 --> 06:40.981
West Point and Harvard Law School.

06:41.022 --> 06:43.967
I'd put my own life in his hands.

06:51.658 --> 06:53.577
Once we remove the ventilator,

06:53.660 --> 06:55.021
it'll be a matter of minutes.

06:55.021 --> 06:59.280
You may hear a slight rattle
in the chest. This is normal.

06:59.374 --> 07:02.210
The suffering should be minimal.

07:02.252 --> 07:03.712
Do it.

07:12.011 --> 07:14.180
Step away from the ventilator!
Move away.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.224
I have a court order.

07:18.518 --> 07:20.395
Barry!

07:21.146 --> 07:23.189
He's alive!

07:23.314 --> 07:25.567
He's alive!

07:33.324 --> 07:34.617
So Marissa,

07:34.659 --> 07:36.151
before I meet with the board at

07:36.151 --> 07:38.611
Adams about reconsidering their decision,

07:38.614 --> 07:42.082
I thought it might be a good idea
for us to get together

07:42.083 --> 07:45.502
and have a whole bunch of sugar
and talk about school.

07:45.503 --> 07:46.963
Okay.

07:47.004 --> 07:49.125
What's your favorite part of the day?

07:49.125 --> 07:51.592
I like all my classes.

07:51.634 --> 07:55.930
But, I guess art.
Drawing and painting and stuff.

07:55.972 --> 07:59.350
When I was in fourth grade

07:59.433 --> 08:02.186
I remember having to draw a horse.

08:02.221 --> 08:04.939
It gave me a very tough time.

08:04.981 --> 08:07.483
I'm studying Magritte.

08:08.192 --> 08:10.778
And what do you like about Magritte?

08:10.820 --> 08:13.364
The way things are put together.

08:13.406 --> 08:15.706
It's so unlikely.

08:15.741 --> 08:17.827
They're beautiful like other paintings

08:17.827 --> 08:19.787
but they make you think,

08:19.829 --> 08:22.409
you wonder why things
are the way they are.

08:22.415 --> 08:24.500
He has this one, a picture of a pipe,

08:24.500 --> 08:26.460
and under it says,

08:26.495 --> 08:28.087
“This is not a pipe”.

08:28.129 --> 08:30.756
It says it in French, I translated it for you.

08:30.756 --> 08:33.049
“Ceci n'est pas une pipe”.

08:33.085 --> 08:34.260
That's it!

08:34.301 --> 08:36.929
One of my favorites as well.

08:36.971 --> 08:39.557
It gave me an idea for one.

08:48.983 --> 08:50.688
Marissa, this is wonderful.

08:51.377 --> 08:52.736
Thank you.

08:53.614 --> 08:56.134
Everyone is always telling girls to smile.

08:56.442 --> 08:59.326
Never say that to guys.

08:59.368 --> 09:02.121
I think smiling is overrated.

09:02.162 --> 09:04.832
As you can see.

09:11.421 --> 09:14.466
I will not allow you to destroy my Barry!

09:14.508 --> 09:17.511
The cat is dead. The animal is a vegetable.

09:17.546 --> 09:19.346
–Guys…
–Nature has spoken. When

09:19.346 --> 09:21.139
it's your time, it's your time.

09:21.139 --> 09:24.347
Says the man with the pacemaker
and the prosthetic balls.

09:24.347 --> 09:27.312
That's different.

09:30.315 --> 09:32.567
Denny? I'm a partner.

09:32.609 --> 09:33.944
It's a cat.

09:33.985 --> 09:35.570
You're exactly right, Brad.

09:35.570 --> 09:38.407
I wouldn't trust an associate
with a case this important.

09:38.407 --> 09:40.951
This is Bev's cat.

09:41.034 --> 09:43.150
That guy in there? Bev's fourth husband.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.996
Mattress Majesty.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.457
Worth millions. Troubling thing about America.

09:47.457 --> 09:48.733
Anybody can grow up and be rich.

09:48.733 --> 09:51.435
Denny, still. It's a cat.

09:51.635 --> 09:53.429
Barry Manilow is not just a cat.

09:53.429 --> 09:54.199
What?

09:54.234 --> 09:56.699
Barry Manilow. Cat's full name.

09:57.101 --> 09:58.076
Even better.

09:58.111 --> 09:59.690
Barry Manilow is Bev's cat.

09:59.690 --> 10:01.973
And if it matters to Bev, then I, Denny Crane,

10:01.973 --> 10:03.711
have to pretend that it matters to me.

10:03.711 --> 10:04.181
But, Denny…

10:04.181 --> 10:05.197
Bev will be happy,

10:05.197 --> 10:07.005
which makes me happy,
which makes you happy.

10:07.005 --> 10:10.352
So really, Brad, you're doing this
to make you happy.

10:18.405 --> 10:21.574
Two months ago I was walking to my car

10:21.616 --> 10:25.096
and I was almost there,
I was already getting out my keys,

10:26.246 --> 10:29.833
when this man…

10:31.125 --> 10:35.755
I don't know where… he…

10:35.790 --> 10:38.633
he grabbed me, and…

10:41.177 --> 10:43.721
Take your time.

10:47.016 --> 10:49.686
After he was done, he just kept hitting me

10:49.727 --> 10:52.897
and hitting me and hitting me…

10:52.939 --> 10:56.067
And then I woke up in the hospital.

10:56.109 --> 10:58.820
So you didn't choose St Mary's specifically?

10:58.861 --> 11:00.738
No, I wasn't even conscious.

11:00.780 --> 11:03.241
They just took me to the nearest emergency room.

11:03.241 --> 11:05.326
At any time while you were being treated,

11:05.326 --> 11:07.954
did nurses or physicians bring up the possibility

11:07.954 --> 11:09.865
of becoming pregnant from the attack?

11:09.865 --> 11:11.707
My mom and I asked about it, and

11:11.707 --> 11:13.501
they said the chances were small.

11:13.501 --> 11:15.672
but I wanted to take the morning-after pill

11:15.672 --> 11:17.004
anyway just in case

11:17.046 --> 11:19.686
and Dr Tusten said that was not an available

11:19.689 --> 11:22.385
at a Catholic-affiliated hospital.

11:22.426 --> 11:24.053
How long were you at St Mary's?

11:24.053 --> 11:25.082
Three days.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.763
And after you were discharged?

11:26.763 --> 11:28.279
We went to our family doctor to

11:28.279 --> 11:29.767
try to get the prescription there.

11:29.767 --> 11:31.927
That's when they told us that it has

11:31.950 --> 11:34.105
to be taken within seventy-two hours.

11:34.105 --> 11:36.688
It was too late. I was already pregnant.

11:37.158 --> 11:41.403
How do you plan to handle the pregnancy?

11:42.112 --> 11:45.601
I have always been morally
opposed to abortion, so…

11:47.076 --> 11:50.077
of course I never imagined this.

11:52.373 --> 11:55.084
I don't… I don't know.

11:56.251 --> 11:57.576
When you were told that

11:57.576 --> 11:59.559
emergency contraception was unavailable,

11:59.559 --> 12:01.924
did you ask for a referral

12:02.007 --> 12:03.884
to get the medication elsewhere?

12:03.884 --> 12:05.552
No, because…

12:06.595 --> 12:08.638
Did you or your mother

12:08.673 --> 12:10.682
bring the concern up again

12:10.766 --> 12:12.101
during your time at the hospital?

12:12.101 --> 12:13.685
Well, they had made it pretty clear…

12:13.685 --> 12:18.607
I'm sorry, Amelia. Yes or no?

12:19.066 --> 12:19.890
No.

12:19.925 --> 12:21.085
Thank you.

12:21.318 --> 12:23.005
Nothing further.

12:34.498 --> 12:36.041
It was on Denny's orders.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.376
It's Bev's cat.

12:37.459 --> 12:38.931
That woman's influence on

12:38.931 --> 12:40.545
this firm is increasing daily.

12:40.545 --> 12:42.062
Well at least the case won't go to court.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.109
They've agreed to arbitration,

12:43.109 --> 12:44.426
once the arbitrator sees the evidence

12:44.426 --> 12:46.163
he'll rule to pull the plug and that'll be that.

12:46.163 --> 12:48.094
You'd better hope he doesn't.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.897
Come again?

12:50.425 --> 12:55.276
Brad, since your attempt to bribe
Denny's fiancée to leave him failed

12:55.277 --> 12:59.550
so miserably we must now stay
on her good side lest she tell Denny.

12:59.585 --> 13:05.695
You have to win this case
quickly and quietly.

13:07.572 --> 13:10.116
It's like Friggin Shakespear around here.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.773
Dr Kumi, as an OB-Gyn, could you tell us

13:12.786 --> 13:15.372
how and why emergency contraception is used?

13:15.372 --> 13:17.207
It's a higher dosage of the same hormones

13:17.207 --> 13:19.125
that are used in birth control pills.

13:19.125 --> 13:23.325
It's administered as a last minute
contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.

13:23.505 --> 13:27.525
And in your expert opinion,
how is it related to the abortion pill?

13:27.842 --> 13:30.952
It's not.  RU-486, also called the
“abortion pill”,

13:30.987 --> 13:33.262
terminates an existing pregnancy.

13:33.297 --> 13:36.837
Emergency contraception,
like all methods of contraception,

13:36.953 --> 13:38.986
keeps a pregnancy from occurring.

13:39.021 --> 13:41.730
And if a fertilized egg has successfully

13:41.765 --> 13:44.713
been implanted meaning
a pregnancy has begun?

13:44.748 --> 13:47.627
Taking the morning-after pill has no effect.

13:47.662 --> 13:50.939
It can only prevent a pregnancy,
it cannot terminate one.

13:50.939 --> 13:53.371
So there is no correlation between

13:53.406 --> 13:55.768
the morning-after pill and abortion.

13:55.803 --> 13:58.730
There's a significant inverse correlation.

13:58.765 --> 14:00.852
Studies show emergency contraception,

14:00.852 --> 14:02.216
if it's made readily available,

14:02.216 --> 14:06.623
could prevent as many
as seven hundred thousand abortions a year.

14:19.685 --> 14:22.146
Your Honor, this whole thing
is about spite.

14:22.146 --> 14:22.936
–His!
–Hers!

14:22.971 --> 14:23.692
Objection.

14:23.727 --> 14:25.608
People, let's put the vitriol aside

14:25.608 --> 14:27.109
not to mention the complete

14:27.109 --> 14:28.521
ludicrousness of this case.

14:28.521 --> 14:30.029
And look at the facts.

14:30.071 --> 14:32.823
Ms Bridge, you've owned this cat for
eleven years?

14:32.823 --> 14:34.554
That is correct, Your Honor.

14:34.589 --> 14:36.368
Nevertheless, the court awarded

14:36.368 --> 14:38.348
Mr Bridge joint custody of Barry.

14:38.486 --> 14:41.620
The cat's name is Barry Manilow?

14:42.122 --> 14:43.250
It is, Your Honor.

14:43.292 --> 14:46.212
My client has developed
a strong bond with Barry.

14:46.212 --> 14:47.338
Strong bond.

14:47.379 --> 14:49.173
Strong bond? Give me a break.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.480
Your Honor, let the record reflect
that since the divorce

14:51.480 --> 14:55.022
Mr Bridge has been late in returning the cat,
fed him dry food only,

14:55.022 --> 14:56.802
did not have adequate litter box hygiene.

14:56.802 --> 15:00.057
And was often seen calling
the cat ‘stupid’ in public.

15:00.349 --> 15:01.833
That's terrible.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.743
It's a cat.
I don't think I hurt his feelings.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.584
As directed by the joint custody agreement,

15:07.619 --> 15:10.530
Mr Bridge was required
to make all veterinary payments.

15:10.530 --> 15:13.391
And Ms Bridge, acting out of malice,
took advantage of that

15:13.391 --> 15:16.217
by subjecting the cat
to the most expensive treatments possible.

15:16.217 --> 15:18.237
Objection. He's disparaging my client.

15:18.237 --> 15:20.133
Three thousand dollars a month?

15:20.168 --> 15:22.029
Could this possibly be correct?

15:22.564 --> 15:23.542
Yeah, it is, Your Honor.

15:23.542 --> 15:25.335
We have an affidavit from the vet.

15:25.335 --> 15:29.022
Barry is ninety-nine point nine percent dead.

15:29.057 --> 15:32.861
Which makes him point one percent alive.

15:33.574 --> 15:35.583
The glass is half full, Your Honor.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.488
Barry's completely alive to me.

15:37.523 --> 15:39.889
How could you tell under your drunken haze?

15:39.889 --> 15:40.899
–Hey!
–Hey.

15:40.934 --> 15:41.874
Enough!

15:41.909 --> 15:46.194
Let I remind you that I can still pose
sanctions in arbitration.

15:46.229 --> 15:48.279
This is a property matter only.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.211
Keep the emotions out.

15:52.131 --> 15:54.306
We shall reconvene tomorrow

15:54.341 --> 15:57.886
and I'll try not to remind myself

15:57.921 --> 16:01.362
that this is a day I'll never get back.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.878
Excuse me, could you direct me
to the conference room please?

16:09.878 --> 16:11.713
Sure. It's down the hall to the left.

16:11.713 --> 16:13.298
Thank you.

16:22.766 --> 16:23.714
Hello, everyone!

16:23.714 --> 16:24.487
Hello!

16:24.726 --> 16:26.691
You must be the chairman,
Lester Tremont?

16:26.691 --> 16:27.311
I am.

16:27.312 --> 16:30.398
I'm Alan Shore.
Thank you for seeing me.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.108
I won't take up much of your time.

16:32.108 --> 16:34.986
As you know I'm here
regarding Marissa Deaver.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.738
Yes, we have her application in front of us.

16:36.738 --> 16:38.198
Ah! Delightful.

16:38.239 --> 16:41.492
We can all take pleasure in it together.

16:41.701 --> 16:45.496
As you see she's obviously
an exceptional student.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.583
She's in the top ten percentile
on her standardized tests,

16:48.583 --> 16:50.501
her grades have never dipped
below an A-minus,

16:50.501 --> 16:54.146
she persues and excels in a broad range
of extracurricular activities

16:54.146 --> 16:57.318
and yet she wasn't admitted
into your fine institution.

16:57.318 --> 16:58.578
We all make mistakes.

16:58.578 --> 17:00.718
And perhaps it was partially our fault.

17:00.718 --> 17:02.729
Her mother tells me she had
a dreadful interview

17:02.729 --> 17:04.928
which sometimes happens,
especially considering

17:04.928 --> 17:07.368
the extenuating circumstances in this case.

17:07.368 --> 17:09.740
My thought to rectify the situation is this:

17:09.740 --> 17:13.207
you re-interview Marissa,
review her remarkable work

17:13.242 --> 17:16.327
and reconsider putting her
on your roster here at Adams Academy

17:16.327 --> 17:19.446
and let's go beat our arch rivals,
whoever they are.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.758
Sounds like quite a plan.

17:22.037 --> 17:25.696
Unfortunately we have sent out
all of our admissions letters,

17:25.728 --> 17:28.338
the class is full and there's
an extensive wait list.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.020
Ah.

17:29.055 --> 17:31.815
And while we would love
to accomodate Marissa,

17:31.923 --> 17:33.869
it would be unfair to all the other applicants.

17:33.869 --> 17:36.374
Yes it would be. I was hoping
we wouldn't tell them.

17:36.374 --> 17:38.774
Have you seen any of Marissa's art work?

17:39.519 --> 17:44.524
Here's a self-portrait which certainly exhibits
a depth of insight

17:44.559 --> 17:47.468
that is highly unusual for a child of nine.

17:47.503 --> 17:50.309
As you know, Marissa is a girl
who cannot smile.

17:50.309 --> 17:51.895
Yes, that was brought to our attention,

17:51.895 --> 17:53.306
and our hearts go out to her.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.648
Tell you what. Let's make a deal.

17:54.648 --> 17:57.708
Keep your hearts, and let the girl
into the school.

17:57.847 --> 18:00.050
Mr Shore. The Adams Academy is a highly

18:00.050 --> 18:02.184
demanding, highly competitive institution.

18:02.184 --> 18:05.379
We turn down over ninety percent
of our applicants.

18:05.414 --> 18:09.014
And in a transfer case like this,
it's ninety-eight percent.

18:09.125 --> 18:13.341
Now for whatever reasons, Marissa
simply did not meet our standards.

18:13.376 --> 18:15.485
Perhaps she just need a year of maturing…

18:15.485 --> 18:17.692
Maturing? She's ready for retirement.

18:17.692 --> 18:20.664
Well, she is free to reapply to our
academy next year.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.366
She cannot wait another year.

18:22.366 --> 18:24.263
Thank you for coming in, Mr Shore.

18:24.263 --> 18:26.675
I take it we've stopped being nice.
I know I have.

18:26.675 --> 18:28.828
Mr Tremont, Marissa has a disability,

18:28.828 --> 18:31.442
and you and your institution
are discriminating against her.

18:31.442 --> 18:33.062
Mr Shore, that is not true.

18:33.523 --> 18:35.826
But even if it were true…

18:35.861 --> 18:37.776
as a private school we have every right

18:37.776 --> 18:39.621
to discriminate against disabled students.

18:39.621 --> 18:42.922
As a private school we aren't bound
by the I.D.E.A. and

18:42.957 --> 18:46.858
neither parents nor students have any
recourse to challenge denial of service.

18:46.858 --> 18:48.752
Oh my God. You're a lawyer.

18:48.787 --> 18:50.611
Yes. Several of us are.

18:50.646 --> 18:54.100
Let me tell you two things about myself.
I too am a lawyer.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.467
I can be painfully vindictive
and I do not play fair.

18:57.502 --> 18:58.447
That's three things.

18:58.447 --> 18:59.982
See? Not playing fair already.

18:59.982 --> 19:01.268
And I'm just getting started.

19:01.268 --> 19:04.601
Mr Shore, our school
has been sued several times.

19:05.239 --> 19:07.725
Never successfully.

19:08.826 --> 19:10.751
You know what they say, Lester.

19:10.786 --> 19:12.766
You never forget your first time.

19:24.446 --> 19:26.364
Dr Tusten, Ms Bauer is saying that

19:26.364 --> 19:28.158
there's no moral debate at play here.

19:28.158 --> 19:30.744
In the Catholic religion, human life

19:30.827 --> 19:33.406
begins when the egg is fertilized,
not implanted.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.331
At that stage a life is in motion.

19:35.331 --> 19:37.131
Regardless of how it happened,

19:37.167 --> 19:38.668
my moral and religious beliefs

19:38.668 --> 19:40.086
will not allow me to interfere

19:40.086 --> 19:41.504
and the conscience clause

19:41.504 --> 19:42.839
ensures that I don't have to.

19:42.839 --> 19:45.306
Of course you also follow this.

19:45.341 --> 19:47.385
The US Department of Justice's protocol

19:47.385 --> 19:49.721
for treating sexual assault victims,
is that right?

19:49.721 --> 19:51.723
It's a very effective tool for

19:51.806 --> 19:53.725
handling the delicate nature of these cases.

19:53.725 --> 19:56.603
In the one hundred and thirty pages of
this document

19:56.603 --> 19:59.439
does it ever recommend using the
morning-after pill?

19:59.439 --> 20:00.440
No.

20:00.523 --> 20:02.949
But it does address
several important issues

20:02.949 --> 20:05.582
regarding the care of a sexual assault victim,

20:05.582 --> 20:08.180
including collecting a biological sample
to assist

20:08.180 --> 20:10.420
in locating and prosecuting the attacker.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.733
And were you successful
in obtaining that sample?

20:12.733 --> 20:13.613
We were.

20:13.648 --> 20:17.624
The rapist was identified, convicted
and is awaiting sentencing.

20:19.264 --> 20:20.650
Nothing further.

20:26.173 --> 20:28.092
Dr Tusten, in extreme

20:28.175 --> 20:30.052
circumstances like sexual assault,

20:30.052 --> 20:33.180
many Catholic hospitals will make an exception

20:33.215 --> 20:34.765
and provide the rape victims

20:34.765 --> 20:36.183
with emergency contraception.

20:36.183 --> 20:38.602
Catholic hospitals are free to interpret sections

20:38.602 --> 20:43.136
of the Ethical and Religious Directives
liberally or conservatively.

20:43.149 --> 20:47.694
We at St Mary's take a very strict
application of Catholic teachings.

20:47.695 --> 20:50.823
Tell me, Dr Tusten, do you have
a set schedule at the ER?

20:50.823 --> 20:52.741
Nine to five, Monday to Friday?

20:52.783 --> 20:54.827
Shifts are much longer than that.

20:54.869 --> 20:57.538
We're often on call for twenty-four
hours at a time.

20:57.538 --> 20:59.623
Ah! So you often work weekends?

20:59.707 --> 21:00.708
Of course.

21:00.791 --> 21:04.503
But that would put you squarely on the
job during the Sabbath.  And..

21:04.503 --> 21:09.812
<i>Exodus 35:2</i> states that he who works
on the Sabbath should be put to death.

21:10.931 --> 21:13.874
That's a rather fundamentalist interpretation.

21:13.909 --> 21:14.551
Moving on.

21:14.586 --> 21:19.143
<i>Mark 16:18</i> states that a believer can

21:19.226 --> 21:21.814
drink any deadly thing and not be harmed.

21:21.849 --> 21:23.899
As a physician, are you ready to say that

21:23.899 --> 21:25.845
your Catholic patients can take a swig

21:25.845 --> 21:27.722
of arsenic and suffer no adverse effects?

21:27.722 --> 21:30.036
That's not intended
to be interpreted literally.

21:30.036 --> 21:32.695
But, you interpret some things literally.

21:32.730 --> 21:34.830
Are you saying that you just follow

21:34.864 --> 21:37.624
the parts of the Bible
that make sense to you?

21:38.118 --> 21:41.672
God was fairly straightforward with,
“Thou shalt not kill”.

22:07.982 --> 22:10.527
They said, “If you pour it, people come”.

22:10.569 --> 22:12.994
Not tonight, Denny. I'm angry.

22:13.029 --> 22:15.866
Did you know private schools
can openly discriminate

22:15.866 --> 22:19.578
because of religion, gender, even disability?

22:19.613 --> 22:21.079
Of course they can. They're private.

22:21.079 --> 22:22.998
That's the way it oughtta to be.

22:22.998 --> 22:26.167
That's the way it once was with clubs.

22:26.209 --> 22:30.504
Before the feminists, lesbian cabal
ruined this country.

22:30.505 --> 22:33.501
Trying to get a young girl
into the Adams Academy.

22:33.501 --> 22:35.062
The one Miss Gloomy Gerta there?

22:35.062 --> 22:36.344
She's not gloomy.

22:36.428 --> 22:39.264
Oh, pulled a coin out of her ear,
she didn't even laugh.

22:39.264 --> 22:40.444
There's something wrong with that girl.

22:40.444 --> 22:42.291
That is the acid test.

22:42.326 --> 22:44.797
You're a little Gloomy Gerta yourself,
aren't you?

22:44.797 --> 22:47.272
I don't know how I'm gonna get her in.

22:47.355 --> 22:50.635
The entire legal system sits squarely
on the other side.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.275
You are missing the whole point.

22:52.275 --> 22:53.040
Which is?

22:53.075 --> 22:54.338
The concept of private.

22:54.338 --> 22:56.438
Private doesn't operate by the law.

22:56.445 --> 22:58.483
Private operates above the law.

22:58.518 --> 23:00.990
Like, like Greek gods.

23:01.025 --> 23:04.455
Hovering above the earth on

23:04.539 --> 23:05.439
their own private mountain.

23:05.439 --> 23:08.715
Now Greek gods broke the rules
and the laws,

23:08.750 --> 23:13.140
but the one thing they respected
was power and influence.

23:13.175 --> 23:16.728
And Alan, if all else fails,

23:16.763 --> 23:20.281
and you think you've lost

23:20.316 --> 23:21.831
pretend you've won!

23:21.866 --> 23:24.164
Works for our president.

23:39.282 --> 23:41.965
Maybe it just isn't funny.

23:46.539 --> 23:48.749
I hate cats.

23:50.668 --> 23:52.586
I beg your pardon?

23:52.628 --> 23:54.505
Can't stand 'em.

23:54.547 --> 23:57.967
Barry belonged to my third husband.

23:58.008 --> 24:00.094
When he tried to pick me up at a bar,

24:00.094 --> 24:04.650
his toupee was slipping.  He told me
he was a breast inspector.

24:05.558 --> 24:07.024
And you married him?

24:07.059 --> 24:09.853
You can see why I preferred the cat.

24:09.895 --> 24:11.438
Husbands come and go.

24:11.480 --> 24:15.401
And when they go
their friends go with them

24:15.609 --> 24:18.279
and then you end up alone.

24:18.529 --> 24:21.407
Except for Barry.

24:22.157 --> 24:25.660
I apologize for what can be construed

24:25.695 --> 24:29.164
as an inappropriate gesture last week.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.465
As you should.

24:31.500 --> 24:35.071
And I know you think
I'm blackmailing you

24:35.106 --> 24:38.642
because you tried to bribe me, and I am,

24:40.830 --> 24:45.409
but putting all this aside for now,

24:48.724 --> 24:51.684
I really need you to win this.

24:52.729 --> 24:54.607
Please.

24:59.319 --> 25:00.988
You wanted to see me, Mr Crane?

25:00.988 --> 25:03.782
Yeah. Yeah. Garry, ah.

25:03.824 --> 25:05.242
Good morning.

25:05.492 --> 25:10.080
Here, come on.

25:15.127 --> 25:17.170
Funny?

25:19.464 --> 25:21.167
How did you do that?

25:22.926 --> 25:25.220
You and me lunch tomorrow…

25:25.255 --> 25:27.264
I'll show you how.

25:34.062 --> 25:36.648
Let's keep in mind exactly who's

25:36.683 --> 25:39.234
at fault for Amelia Warner's trauma.

25:39.275 --> 25:40.610
Her rapist.

25:40.652 --> 25:44.239
And yet, here we are attacking
the doctor that treated Amelia,

25:44.239 --> 25:48.827
whoes efforts are responsible
for the apprehension and imprisonment
of that rapist.

25:48.827 --> 25:51.345
Because that doctor acting within his rights,

25:51.345 --> 25:56.083
did not administer medication that
conflicted with his religious beliefs,

25:56.084 --> 26:00.044
beliefs that he promised to uphold
when he was hired at St Mary's.

26:02.048 --> 26:05.093
But forget religion. Let's look at the law.

26:05.134 --> 26:07.387
In a one hundred and thirty pages of protocol on

26:07.387 --> 26:09.639
how to treat sexual assault victims

26:09.722 --> 26:11.933
the Unites States Department of Justice

26:11.933 --> 26:15.239
never even mentions the use
of emergency contraception.

26:15.770 --> 26:18.731
It's simply not the standard of care.

26:18.773 --> 26:23.817
There is in fact no law in place in the
state of Massachusetts

26:23.852 --> 26:29.737
that explicitly requires Catholic
hospitals to dispense or provide

26:29.772 --> 26:35.622
information for emergency contraception
under any circumstances.

26:35.623 --> 26:40.211
And we simply can't pretend that there is

26:40.246 --> 26:44.799
on the basis of sentiment or sympathy.

26:44.840 --> 26:50.205
One of our many rights in this country
is what is called “informed consent”.

26:50.304 --> 26:55.028
Every patient has the right to decide
what happens to his or her body.

26:55.351 --> 26:59.825
And to make that decision
a patient needs to rely on her

26:59.860 --> 27:03.109
doctor to disclose all available options.

27:03.150 --> 27:07.153
Do you want chemo therapy
or surgery for a brain tumor?

27:07.154 --> 27:09.370
Do you want to amputate below the knee

27:09.370 --> 27:13.410
or hope for the best and risk death
from gangrene?

27:13.452 --> 27:19.659
Do you want to prevent pregnancy
or have your rapist's baby?

27:19.660 --> 27:22.253
Amelia Warner didn't get to choose.

27:22.294 --> 27:26.678
She was deprived of a crucial
medically relevant option because

27:26.713 --> 27:28.967
her doctor didn't approve of it.

27:29.009 --> 27:33.554
She didn't choose to receive health care
restricted by religious doctrine.

27:33.555 --> 27:36.767
She was taken to the ER unconscious.

27:36.809 --> 27:39.978
She relied on her doctor at St Mary's

27:40.020 --> 27:45.441
to provide her with proper care
or refer her elsewhere and he failed her.

27:46.807 --> 27:50.816
Twenty-five thousand women will become
pregnant from rape this year.

27:50.816 --> 27:54.523
If all of those women took this
emergency contraception,

27:55.224 --> 27:59.114
twenty-two thousand of those pregnancies
could be avoided.

28:00.429 --> 28:05.322
Doctors provide a crucial public benefit
to a diverse society

28:05.357 --> 28:10.216
and we cannot condone it
when they impose their own religion

28:10.217 --> 28:14.845
on patients whom they are
professionally obligated to serve.

28:14.846 --> 28:18.892
Especially patients
in their most vulnerable state.

28:18.934 --> 28:25.397
A teenager for example, brought in
to the emergency room after a brutal rape.

28:25.398 --> 28:28.610
A teenager who is now left to choose

28:28.693 --> 28:33.517
between violating her own moral principals
in terminating the pregnancy

28:33.552 --> 28:38.161
or postponing college to deliver this child.

28:38.203 --> 28:40.580
A child conceived against her will,

28:40.615 --> 28:46.782
a direct result of the most traumatic
ordeal she has ever endured.

29:02.227 --> 29:03.311
Mr Tremont!

29:03.346 --> 29:04.395
Mr Shore!

29:04.437 --> 29:07.190
I believe our business is done
in regards to Ms Deaver.

29:07.190 --> 29:09.530
Oh, absolutely. Water under the bridge.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.999
I'm here in an entirely unrelated matter.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.821
Yes. What is it, Cindy?

29:13.863 --> 29:16.074
<i>There's a news crew from ABC here?</i>

29:16.074 --> 29:17.040
What?

29:17.075 --> 29:19.494
That happens to be the unrelated matter.

29:19.529 --> 29:21.120
What's going on?

29:21.162 --> 29:23.998
Well. The thing is it's all my fault.

29:24.033 --> 29:26.167
I was so sure I was going to

29:26.250 --> 29:28.314
be victorious and persuade you

29:28.349 --> 29:30.389
to admit Marissa into your school.

29:30.414 --> 29:34.716
Total hubris on my part,
I went and called Darcy DeVictor,

29:34.717 --> 29:38.179
she does the human interest pieces
over at the local ABC affiliate.

29:38.179 --> 29:39.347
We were briefly an item.

29:39.347 --> 29:41.696
Don't let her perky
on-air demeanor fool you

29:41.696 --> 29:44.018
she's quite deviant in the bedroom. Anyway.

29:44.018 --> 29:47.521
I figured this was exactly the kind
of story that Darcy likes…

29:47.521 --> 29:51.025
and this is the part that gets me
excited… sink her teeth into.

29:51.025 --> 29:53.027
You know the little artist that can't smile

29:53.027 --> 29:54.939
and the supportive school that loves her.

29:54.939 --> 29:57.657
I always like showing off in front
of an exgirlfriend,

29:57.657 --> 30:00.798
but wouldn't you know it,
I got excited and jumped the gun.

30:00.798 --> 30:02.246
So! I'll let you get back to work.

30:02.246 --> 30:04.723
I'm gonna go out and let her know that
I was wrong and you were right and

30:04.723 --> 30:06.938
the school prevailed
in its determination to discriminate

30:06.938 --> 30:09.805
against this little girl and her disability.

30:11.381 --> 30:13.919
You wouldn't happen to have any
of Marissa's drawings still?

30:13.919 --> 30:17.155
Darcy was dying to show them on air.

30:17.339 --> 30:20.789
Hey!  This may be a way
to salvage a story actually.

30:20.824 --> 30:23.276
You know? The little girl who can't smile,

30:23.276 --> 30:27.361
her dream shattered
by the exclusionary will of the inbred elite.

30:27.664 --> 30:28.994
Something like that!

30:29.194 --> 30:34.568
Oh! Wait! I got something.

30:34.860 --> 30:36.612
Darcy?

30:41.283 --> 30:42.576
Lester!

30:42.618 --> 30:45.224
Doggy massage. Pet Prozac.

30:45.259 --> 30:47.831
Kitty yoga. Bark-Mitzvahs.

30:47.873 --> 30:50.793
Pet plastic surgery? And now life support?

30:50.834 --> 30:52.377
What is wrong with us?

30:52.419 --> 30:54.421
Have we lost all perspective?

30:54.463 --> 30:57.104
There are now as many starving people
in this world

30:57.104 --> 30:59.718
as there were people in this world
a generation ago.

30:59.718 --> 31:05.352
And yet every year in this country we spend
over thirty billion dollars on our pets.

31:05.766 --> 31:07.803
Your Honor, you had this right
from the beginning.

31:07.803 --> 31:08.935
This is ludicrous.

31:08.977 --> 31:12.356
This is a property issue just as you noted.

31:12.397 --> 31:15.609
And as hard as it is
to let Barry Manilow go,

31:15.650 --> 31:18.820
it's time to stop prolonging the inevitable.

31:21.239 --> 31:22.970
Your Honor? I have to admit

31:23.005 --> 31:24.743
when I first picked this case

31:24.743 --> 31:27.370
I thought it was just as silly as you do.

31:27.412 --> 31:28.580
I mean this couple broke up,

31:28.580 --> 31:30.248
they managed to divvy up
the car and TV,

31:30.248 --> 31:33.428
why couldn't they figure out
what to do with the cat?

31:34.753 --> 31:36.463
Because.

31:36.504 --> 31:40.008
Unlike our cars and our TV's

31:40.050 --> 31:43.678
our pets transcend our property.

31:43.720 --> 31:47.230
Property that lives and breathes.

31:47.265 --> 31:50.414
Property that loves us back unconditionally

31:50.449 --> 31:53.563
in an increasingly harsh and isolating world.

31:53.605 --> 31:56.211
This is what Barry Manilow is, and

31:56.246 --> 31:58.818
always has been to Beverly Bridge!

31:58.860 --> 32:00.179
Now, Barry Manilow didn't

32:00.179 --> 32:02.037
care how much makeup Beverly wore

32:02.037 --> 32:03.825
or whether her outfits were just a

32:03.825 --> 32:05.617
little bit too tight for someone her age.

32:05.617 --> 32:07.368
He never ostracized her when she got

32:07.368 --> 32:08.995
divorced or demanded she get a job.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.496
Never asked her how she spent her money.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.999
Never came home smelling like another woman.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.959
And he never made Beverly his trophy!

32:14.959 --> 32:19.797
Barry Manilow was simply there for Beverly.

32:19.832 --> 32:23.468
In fact Barry Manilow treated Beverly
better than most of her husbands did.

32:23.468 --> 32:26.637
Now he may be very ill now,

32:26.679 --> 32:29.559
but there's a slight chance
that he can recover.

32:29.599 --> 32:32.560
We need to hold on to that chance.

32:32.602 --> 32:36.564
'Cause, who among us here
has the power to say

32:36.606 --> 32:38.691
that the spark of a soul

32:38.733 --> 32:43.694
is any less significant because
it resides in the body of a pet?

32:44.197 --> 32:45.865
I do.

32:46.574 --> 32:48.284
It's a cat.

32:48.326 --> 32:51.208
And the costs of keeping this cat on a

32:51.243 --> 32:54.056
ventilator indefinitely are exorbitant.

32:54.091 --> 32:57.560
Especially coupled with the pain
this cat must be in

32:57.595 --> 33:01.630
and its remote chance of recovery.

33:01.672 --> 33:05.134
Ms Bridge, I am sorry for your loss,

33:05.176 --> 33:09.138
but I must hereby order that
Barry Manilow's ventilator

33:09.180 --> 33:12.044
be shut off.

34:12.701 --> 34:15.871
That damn cat isn't gonna die.

34:16.580 --> 34:19.541
Fine. You can have him.

34:36.224 --> 34:37.893
Has the jury reached a verdict?

34:37.893 --> 34:39.014
We have, Your Honor.

34:39.014 --> 34:40.208
What say you?

34:42.022 --> 34:44.649
We the jury find in favor of the plaintiff

34:44.733 --> 34:47.120
and hereby award compensatory damages

34:47.155 --> 34:49.987
in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars.

34:50.030 --> 34:52.455
Additionally, we award punitive damages

34:52.489 --> 34:56.369
in the amount of two point six million dollars.

34:56.411 --> 34:58.830
The court thanks the jury for its service.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.582
We are adjourned.

35:01.791 --> 35:02.868
Thank you.

35:02.903 --> 35:05.233
Congratulations.

35:05.295 --> 35:06.921
Thank you so much.

35:06.963 --> 35:10.091
Amelia, you are a courageous human being.

35:10.133 --> 35:13.261
I don't feel like it, but thank you.

35:26.316 --> 35:28.359
You look good in blue, Marissa.

35:28.401 --> 35:30.611
I drew this for you.

35:35.825 --> 35:37.618
Oh my goodness!

35:45.126 --> 35:48.838
It looks like they're going
to have a quite a day.

35:49.005 --> 35:51.048
You know, Marissa,

35:51.090 --> 35:53.718
not smiling has its benefits.

35:53.759 --> 35:56.971
You don't give away your thoughts
so easily

35:57.013 --> 36:00.099
It's a great advantage in card playing

36:00.141 --> 36:03.102
That's funny. But…

36:04.186 --> 36:06.439
I'd rather fit in.

36:07.315 --> 36:08.736
Have you ever heard of a

36:08.736 --> 36:11.527
Greek philosopher named Epictetus?

36:11.569 --> 36:12.570
No.

36:12.653 --> 36:18.075
It was a funny man
with a certain flare for life.

36:18.159 --> 36:23.664
Epictetus compared people who “fit in”

36:23.747 --> 36:27.877
to the white threads of a toga.
Indistinguishable.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.629
He wanted to be the purple thread.

36:30.713 --> 36:33.299
“That small part which is bright,”

36:33.382 --> 36:37.501
“and makes all the rest appear graceful
and beautiful”.

36:38.095 --> 36:39.930
“Why then…” he asked, “do you

36:40.014 --> 36:41.849
tell me to make myself like the many?”

36:41.849 --> 36:46.270
“And if I do, how shall I still be purple?”

36:46.353 --> 36:50.774
Sometimes being purple is kind of a pain.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.574
Yes.

37:15.299 --> 37:16.368
Bev.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.034
Hello, Brad.

37:19.428 --> 37:22.389
Barry's feeling better?

37:22.431 --> 37:26.268
I mean, he doesn't walk
or move or anything,

37:26.309 --> 37:28.979
but he's breathing on his own.

37:30.105 --> 37:32.732
I didn't exactly win the case,

37:32.774 --> 37:35.402
but “All's well, that end's well.”

37:35.777 --> 37:37.779
So we're square.

37:38.113 --> 37:41.741
I'll tell you when we're square, Brad.

37:45.704 --> 37:47.873
Damn it.

38:02.804 --> 38:04.681
So?

38:04.723 --> 38:06.766
I just spoke with her mother.

38:06.808 --> 38:09.144
She's having an abortion.

38:09.185 --> 38:11.479
While it's still legal.

38:12.272 --> 38:15.984
Girl who said she would
never even consider it.

38:16.025 --> 38:19.237
Well. What's the alternative?

38:19.279 --> 38:22.365
Having custody battles with your rapist?

38:22.407 --> 38:24.826
Sorry. That was really tasteless.

38:24.861 --> 38:26.369
It's all tasteless.

38:26.411 --> 38:28.121
I mean the more science comes up with

38:28.121 --> 38:32.021
alternatives to the misery of abortion
the louder the opposition.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.544
Course it's about power.

38:34.585 --> 38:37.964
It's always been about power.

38:39.549 --> 38:42.427
These guys have any friends?

38:42.462 --> 38:44.595
Not for long.

38:54.272 --> 38:56.315
Alan.

38:56.691 --> 38:58.985
I've been thinking about something.

38:59.026 --> 39:00.987
What's that?

39:01.028 --> 39:02.446
I want you to kill me.

39:02.488 --> 39:04.230
The scotch and cigars and nightly

39:04.230 --> 39:06.325
consumption or red meat have that well in hand.

39:06.325 --> 39:08.911
No, no, no. Seriously.

39:09.036 --> 39:12.123
I don't fear death. I never have.

39:12.164 --> 39:16.210
But I am afraid of being
hooked up to a machine.

39:16.252 --> 39:22.091
All those tubes, brain, mush.

39:22.299 --> 39:23.669
Would you like to live like that?

39:23.669 --> 39:25.678
No. If it came to that, my

39:25.761 --> 39:27.680
friend, I would pull your plug.

39:27.721 --> 39:30.683
Pull a plug?
What kind of a death is that?

39:31.273 --> 39:32.597
I want you to shoot me.

39:32.597 --> 39:33.643
Shoot you?

39:33.644 --> 39:35.241
Denny Crane is not gonna

39:35.276 --> 39:38.148
be turned off like a hair dryer.

39:38.190 --> 39:39.984
Live by the gun, you die by the gun.

39:39.984 --> 39:41.652
I'm not gonna shoot you.

39:41.687 --> 39:43.320
Why not? I'd shoot you!

39:43.362 --> 39:44.905
Denny, you've been a lawyer

39:44.905 --> 39:46.365
in this town for forty years.

39:46.365 --> 39:47.866
I'm sure there are plenty of

39:47.866 --> 39:49.284
people who'd willingly shoot you.

39:49.284 --> 39:51.036
Well, I don't wanna be shot by a stranger.

39:51.036 --> 39:55.499
I wanna be shot by someone who,
who cares for me.

39:55.582 --> 39:57.705
The answer is, “No”.

39:59.586 --> 40:03.424
Bah! You b… Democrat!

40:03.507 --> 40:05.095
Protesting wars, banning guns!

40:05.095 --> 40:06.614
If you Nancies had your way

40:06.614 --> 40:08.397
nobody would ever shoot anybody.

40:08.397 --> 40:11.515
And then where would we be?

40:11.598 --> 40:14.996
Where would we be?

40:15.305 --> 40:21.871
