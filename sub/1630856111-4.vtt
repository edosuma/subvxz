[Harry]
This place is gorgeous!

01:19.838 --> 01:21.702
What's wrong with it?

01:21.736 --> 01:23.186
Why's it so cheap?

01:23.221 --> 01:24.360
Diarmuid here owes me a favour.

01:24.394 --> 01:26.224
What did you do,
give him a kidney?

01:26.258 --> 01:27.259
He knows what he did!

01:27.294 --> 01:28.674
I said sorry!

01:28.709 --> 01:31.367
This is a no-brainer,
Harry. We've gotta take it.

01:31.401 --> 01:32.540
Plus, we can't keep meeting

01:32.575 --> 01:33.886
prospective clients
in the goose.

01:33.921 --> 01:35.336
Why not?

01:35.371 --> 01:37.787
Glenn is introducing
afternoon karaoke for starters.

01:37.821 --> 01:39.375
For god sakes, Glenn!

01:39.409 --> 01:42.343
Harry, I've been tasked
with great responsibility.

01:43.344 --> 01:45.346
June's relying on me

01:45.381 --> 01:46.830
and I will not let her down.

01:47.969 --> 01:49.557
Between us...

01:49.592 --> 01:51.421
there's bit of a spark
between me and her.

01:51.456 --> 01:53.182
I think I'm in there.

01:53.216 --> 01:55.736
You do realise
June is gay, right?

01:55.770 --> 01:57.807
Is she?

01:57.841 --> 01:59.912
Well, that explains
why she's always kissing women.

01:59.947 --> 02:01.983
[sighs]
Oh, well.

02:02.018 --> 02:04.400
Look, Harry, the
agency's already making

02:04.434 --> 02:06.367
more than enough
to afford this place.

02:06.402 --> 02:07.955
Especially with this price.

02:07.989 --> 02:09.336
And we could have a secretary.

02:09.370 --> 02:10.716
Secretary?

02:10.751 --> 02:13.236
My Petra's looking
for a new job, as it happens.

02:13.271 --> 02:14.893
Got fired from Lidl.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.344
Just 'cause she took a
couple of things home with her.

02:17.378 --> 02:18.931
They were almost
out of date anyway.

02:18.966 --> 02:20.347
Well, maybe not the gin...

02:20.381 --> 02:21.693
or the power tools.

02:21.727 --> 02:23.522
So will I tell her to
come in for an interview?

02:23.557 --> 02:25.006
No!

02:25.041 --> 02:26.318
Fair enough.

02:26.353 --> 02:28.527
What d'ya say?

02:28.562 --> 02:31.565
Well, I suppose at this
price, it would be crazy not to.

02:33.532 --> 02:36.570
Mr. Creely, you have a deal.

02:36.604 --> 02:38.019
[scoffs]

02:38.054 --> 02:39.504
Are we even now?

02:40.332 --> 02:41.540
Not even close.

02:41.575 --> 02:42.817
Uh...

02:42.852 --> 02:46.338
[Charlie]Okay,
Vicky, you're in charge.

02:46.373 --> 02:47.857
[Vicky] Francis McCluskey.

02:47.891 --> 02:50.342
Fifty-three years old,
Wicklow resident.

02:50.377 --> 02:52.241
Cause of death
is pretty obvious.

02:52.275 --> 02:53.276
We have a person of interest.

02:53.311 --> 02:54.657
[clicks fingers]
Jord.

02:57.073 --> 02:58.316
Ben Finnegan.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.834
Dead man's business partner.

02:59.869 --> 03:01.146
Property developers.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.529
Legit as far as we can tell, but
both men have criminal records.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.809
Er...

03:08.843 --> 03:10.569
mostly small time for Finnegan.

03:10.604 --> 03:14.021
A little jail time for receiving
and some minor drug offences.

03:14.055 --> 03:16.265
McCluskey did six years
for armed robbery.

03:16.299 --> 03:17.645
That was fifteen years ago

03:17.680 --> 03:19.509
but he seems to have
been clean ever since.

03:19.544 --> 03:21.304
The day before McCluskey
was killed, he was

03:21.339 --> 03:23.064
heard having a heated
argument with Finnegan.

03:23.099 --> 03:26.447
Witness couldn't say what it was
about, but with McCluskey dead,

03:26.482 --> 03:28.277
Finnegan gets
all of the business.

03:28.311 --> 03:29.692
That's motive.

03:31.659 --> 03:33.868
Er... earlier, Wicklow went to

03:33.903 --> 03:36.768
bring him in for further
questioning, but he ran.

03:36.802 --> 03:38.908
They think he
might have come here.

03:38.942 --> 03:40.254
Finnegan's a dub.

03:40.289 --> 03:42.567
He'll know people here.
Let's go find him.

03:44.776 --> 03:45.880
Good job, Vicky.

03:45.915 --> 03:48.435
[instrumental music]

03:50.368 --> 03:51.852
What was that all about?

04:06.729 --> 04:07.799
Hi, Orla.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.628
[suspenseful music]

04:10.974 --> 04:12.562
I need your help.

04:19.086 --> 04:20.052
Oh!

04:20.087 --> 04:21.571
[sighs]

04:21.606 --> 04:22.814
What happened?

04:22.848 --> 04:24.402
Is it Charlie?

04:24.436 --> 04:26.093
Er, no. Nothing like that.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.339
I need...

04:30.373 --> 04:32.755
I need...

04:32.789 --> 04:34.377
I need...

04:35.378 --> 04:36.862
To borrow some butter?

04:36.897 --> 04:39.762
A kick up the arse?
A dictionary? Just...

04:41.626 --> 04:43.455
Your help.

04:43.490 --> 04:44.663
Oh.

04:44.698 --> 04:47.321
Well, then I suppose
you'd better come in.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.601
[soft music]

04:54.742 --> 04:56.365
[muffled giggle]

04:58.401 --> 04:59.713
There's something
I've not told you.

04:59.747 --> 05:01.370
I've not told anyone.

05:02.198 --> 05:03.786
You're a high-class escort?

05:03.820 --> 05:04.856
What?

05:04.890 --> 05:06.927
Well, maybe not that high class.

05:06.961 --> 05:11.380
But you do have had a bit of
a dominatrix-y feel about you.

05:11.414 --> 05:12.898
I have not!

05:14.900 --> 05:16.074
I had a boyfriend.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.524
- Recently?
- No!

05:17.558 --> 05:19.595
- When I was nineteen.
- Oh.

05:19.629 --> 05:22.874
His name's Ben Finnegan
and he's in trouble.

05:22.908 --> 05:24.116
Oh...

05:24.151 --> 05:26.740
His business
partner was murdered

05:26.774 --> 05:28.535
and the guards are
looking at him for it.

05:28.569 --> 05:30.640
But when they went
to pick him up, he ran!

05:30.675 --> 05:32.401
Well, that's not very
clever of him, is it?

05:32.435 --> 05:35.611
No. There's more.

05:35.645 --> 05:39.200
The person who killed his
partner is a hitman from Spain.

05:39.235 --> 05:42.480
Calls himself
El Cazador, the hunter.

05:42.514 --> 05:44.447
He uses a crossbow.

05:44.482 --> 05:46.863
Oh, very theatrical.

05:46.898 --> 05:49.866
So, er, has Ben told
the guards about this?

05:49.901 --> 05:53.042
Oh, no. You and I know
how guards think.

05:53.076 --> 05:54.630
So, what do you want me to do?

05:54.664 --> 05:57.426
I just want you to meet him.
To hear him out.

05:57.460 --> 05:59.566
Oh, I know him, Harry.
He's not a killer.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.705
[sighs]

06:00.739 --> 06:03.432
Please, will you do
this? For me?

06:03.466 --> 06:05.675
- That depends.
- Uh-huh.

06:05.710 --> 06:09.058
Tell me why you don't
want Charlie to know about him?

06:09.092 --> 06:10.680
Do I have to?

06:10.715 --> 06:13.165
Ah, now you've said that,
yes, you do.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.547
And it had better be juicy.

06:15.582 --> 06:16.721
Oh...

06:17.584 --> 06:19.206
[instrumental music]

06:19.240 --> 06:20.725
Erm...

06:22.830 --> 06:24.142
Yeah...

06:27.559 --> 06:30.182
Well, er, okay. Erm...

06:30.217 --> 06:32.944
When Ben and I were
a couple, we went inter-railing

06:32.978 --> 06:35.671
and, er, we financed the trip...

06:37.742 --> 06:39.502
by selling weed.

06:40.986 --> 06:42.229
And then I might have got

06:42.263 --> 06:43.817
arrested a little bit...

06:44.749 --> 06:45.784
Yeah.

06:45.819 --> 06:48.580
Erm... I didn't hear that.

06:48.615 --> 06:49.892
Hm?

06:49.926 --> 06:51.790
I might have got arrested
a little bit in Germany.

06:53.102 --> 06:54.552
Oh!

06:54.586 --> 06:57.278
Well, I can't believe
what I'm hearing!

06:57.313 --> 06:59.039
I mean, I never imagined

06:59.073 --> 07:01.662
that you'd ever do anything
half as interesting as that.

07:01.697 --> 07:02.870
[sighs]

07:02.905 --> 07:04.941
I told Ben to lay low
while I spoke to you.

07:04.976 --> 07:06.149
Will you meet him?

07:06.184 --> 07:07.599
[sighs]

07:08.876 --> 07:10.982
Well, if I'm gonna do this...

07:11.016 --> 07:12.811
Oh...

07:12.846 --> 07:15.814
Tell him to meet me
here in an hour.

07:18.299 --> 07:20.543
Oh... one more thing.

07:20.578 --> 07:22.994
Can you please keep
Fergus out of this?

07:23.028 --> 07:25.134
Er... I'm sorry, but no.

07:25.168 --> 07:26.618
He's my partner.

07:26.653 --> 07:29.552
If I'm gonna do
this, I'll do it with him.

07:29.587 --> 07:31.140
That isn't up for debate.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.900
But what if he tells Lola?

07:32.935 --> 07:35.731
[sighs]
He wouldn't.

07:35.765 --> 07:37.008
You're wrong about him.

07:37.042 --> 07:39.976
Besides, they don't
see each other anymore, do they?

07:40.011 --> 07:42.323
Do they?

07:42.358 --> 07:45.257
Do you think your mam's ever
gonna change her mind about me?

07:45.292 --> 07:48.053
Hmm... don't count on it.

07:48.088 --> 07:49.538
[laughs]

07:49.572 --> 07:51.643
Not big on changing
her mind, my mother.

07:56.579 --> 07:58.236
How's things
going with your mam?

07:59.271 --> 08:01.135
[exhales]

08:01.170 --> 08:02.585
Going.

08:04.898 --> 08:07.210
She's, er, managed
to persuade Malky

08:07.245 --> 08:08.936
to sit down for
peace talks.

08:08.971 --> 08:11.214
So, er, we'll see.

08:11.249 --> 08:13.078
[laughs softly]

08:13.113 --> 08:15.598
[soft music]

08:23.088 --> 08:24.504
See ya.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.230
Later, skaters.

08:27.265 --> 08:28.749
[phone buzzes]

08:32.960 --> 08:34.514
We have an office.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.726
The hunter's real name
is Alejandro Miralles.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.005
Works for a businessman,
Rubén Orantes.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.696
Francis knew him,

08:44.731 --> 08:47.078
set up a meeting in Madrid,
a potential partnership.

08:47.112 --> 08:49.667
I meet him, I smile politely.

08:49.701 --> 08:51.082
As soon as were out
of there, I say to Francis,

08:51.116 --> 08:52.704
what the fuck?
We cannot be getting

08:52.739 --> 08:54.879
into bed with
Don bleeding Corleone

08:54.913 --> 08:57.951
but Francis goes to
a party this guy's throwing.

08:57.985 --> 08:59.780
I stay at the hotel.

08:59.815 --> 09:03.059
Then Francis comes home early
and he's all jittery.

09:03.094 --> 09:04.233
Wants to leave.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.131
He's already
changed our flights.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.064
I kept asking him,
what's going on?

09:08.099 --> 09:09.894
But he wouldn't tell me.

09:09.928 --> 09:13.691
Then he's dead and
I get a call from this hunter.

09:13.725 --> 09:16.348
Says he wants me to return
what it is Francis and I stole,

09:16.383 --> 09:18.834
or else there's an arrow
with my name on it.

09:18.868 --> 09:21.388
Then I find this

09:21.422 --> 09:22.907
in my front door.

09:26.117 --> 09:27.636
[Harry]
Ben Finnegan.

09:27.670 --> 09:29.120
Well, if you've got
the arrow with your

09:29.154 --> 09:31.156
name on it, he can
hardly kill you with it.

09:31.191 --> 09:33.089
I'm guessing he has a spare.

09:33.124 --> 09:34.953
Did you and Francis
steal from him?

09:34.988 --> 09:37.266
No! Well... I mean, yes.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.130
Francis did, I think.

09:39.164 --> 09:41.270
But I don't know what.

09:41.304 --> 09:43.790
So you're trying to find
something that you

09:43.824 --> 09:45.170
don't know what it is

09:45.205 --> 09:47.138
and you don't know where it is.

09:49.347 --> 09:52.453
I think you're best
off asking the guards.

09:52.488 --> 09:54.732
Oh, no, the guards
won't protect me.

09:54.766 --> 09:56.078
They want to lock me up.

09:56.112 --> 09:58.977
My only hope is to find out
what it is Francis stole

09:59.012 --> 10:00.461
and give it back.

10:00.496 --> 10:03.292
Look, I'm sorry for
bringing this to your door,

10:03.326 --> 10:05.984
I just don't
know what else to do.

10:06.019 --> 10:08.711
I read about you two,
saw the connection with Orla...

10:10.264 --> 10:13.060
So, how do we start looking?

10:13.095 --> 10:16.443
I've searched everywhere Francis
might have stashed something.

10:16.477 --> 10:19.342
The only place
I've not looked is his house.

10:19.377 --> 10:22.276
His wife, Maura, hates me.

10:23.484 --> 10:25.348
Thinks I was a bad influence.

10:25.383 --> 10:27.212
If only she knew.

10:27.247 --> 10:30.250
Francis did six years
for armed robbery,

10:30.284 --> 10:32.908
which he never told her about.

10:32.942 --> 10:35.082
And neither did the spirits.

10:35.117 --> 10:36.705
What does that mean?

10:36.739 --> 10:39.190
Well, she's a...
you know, she's a kook.

10:39.224 --> 10:42.124
Into psychics
and tarot and all that shite.

10:43.815 --> 10:46.507
Trust me, if you turn up
saying you're there to help me,

10:46.542 --> 10:48.406
she'll slam
the door in your face.

10:49.821 --> 10:51.789
Well, we have
to start somewhere.

10:53.342 --> 10:56.000
Your connection to Orla
is 20 years old,

10:56.034 --> 10:59.175
so, it's unlikely El Cazador

10:59.210 --> 11:01.246
will be able
to track you to her,

11:01.281 --> 11:04.456
which means that he won't
be able to track you to us.

11:04.491 --> 11:07.977
Unless he has
a tracking device on him.

11:08.012 --> 11:09.323
You know,

11:09.358 --> 11:10.877
like a phone.

11:10.911 --> 11:12.188
Oh, good point.

11:13.224 --> 11:14.812
If you'd be so kind.

11:17.884 --> 11:19.264
Er...

11:19.299 --> 11:23.061
Don't leave,
don't go near any windows.

11:23.096 --> 11:24.511
Oh, just one more thing.

11:26.133 --> 11:28.101
Can you tell me
something personal

11:28.135 --> 11:30.137
about Maura and Francis?

11:31.311 --> 11:32.864
Orla used to go out
with that fella

11:32.899 --> 11:34.452
but I'm not good
enough for her daughter.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.868
[scoffs]
Bit bloody rich that.

11:36.903 --> 11:38.801
Anyway, why are we
helping this guy again?

11:38.836 --> 11:40.907
Because there's a crazy guy
with a crossbow running

11:40.941 --> 11:44.255
around Dublin, and more people
are gonna die if we don't.

11:44.289 --> 11:46.084
Oh, and you can't
tell Lola any of this.

11:46.119 --> 11:47.430
Like I'd do that!

11:47.465 --> 11:49.087
Though I am
about to lie to a widow

11:49.122 --> 11:50.399
and I'm not happy
about that either.

11:50.433 --> 11:52.263
Well, it's a white lie.

11:52.297 --> 11:54.196
Mm, whitish.

11:54.230 --> 11:55.749
Is this our
third or fourth widow?

11:55.784 --> 11:57.199
[doorbell rings]

11:57.233 --> 11:58.269
I've lost count.

11:58.303 --> 11:59.546
[Fergus clears throat]

12:04.413 --> 12:07.105
Is your name Maura McCluskey?

12:07.140 --> 12:08.382
Yeah.

12:10.074 --> 12:13.353
What's it about?
This really isn't a good time.

12:13.387 --> 12:16.287
This is gonna sound
a bit odd, but my aunt,

12:16.321 --> 12:18.116
she has a message for you.

12:18.151 --> 12:19.497
It's from Francis.

12:20.636 --> 12:22.293
He's here!

12:28.886 --> 12:30.508
What? Who's here?

12:30.542 --> 12:31.923
Francis?

12:31.958 --> 12:33.131
Francis, is that you?

12:33.166 --> 12:34.477
[in deep voice]
Yes, bunny.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.135
Francis!

12:37.170 --> 12:39.482
[in deep voice]
Reveal what is hidden.

12:39.517 --> 12:42.175
What, what does that mean?
What's hidden?

12:44.142 --> 12:45.523
He wants us to follow him.

12:46.973 --> 12:48.319
Ah...

12:52.495 --> 12:55.498
He wants us to go
into the toilet?

12:55.533 --> 12:57.638
He passed through the wall.

12:57.673 --> 12:59.192
Into the utility room?

13:01.021 --> 13:02.851
- Into his study?
- Mm-hm.

13:06.889 --> 13:08.339
My Francis was a good man.

13:08.373 --> 13:10.030
He used to be
a missionary, you know?

13:10.065 --> 13:11.031
He did?

13:11.066 --> 13:13.068
About 15 years ago,

13:13.102 --> 13:14.586
long before I met him.

13:14.621 --> 13:16.209
In the Amazon.

13:16.243 --> 13:17.486
Lived with a tribe

13:17.520 --> 13:20.144
in the middle of the
rainforest for years.

13:21.145 --> 13:23.147
Was it about six years?

13:23.181 --> 13:24.355
It was.

13:24.389 --> 13:25.908
He's speaking to you!

13:25.943 --> 13:27.461
Francis, can you hear me?

13:27.496 --> 13:30.637
[in deep voice]
Reveal what is hidden.

13:30.671 --> 13:31.880
Ooh!

13:31.914 --> 13:33.640
I don't know about
anything hidden.

13:35.159 --> 13:36.954
A safe?

13:36.988 --> 13:38.300
Not here.

13:38.334 --> 13:40.889
He's got one at the office.

13:40.923 --> 13:42.891
Ooh...

13:42.925 --> 13:44.582
[Maura]
Francis was a doodler.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.342
[Fergus]
A crossbow.

13:46.377 --> 13:49.000
He did it all the time
when he was thinking.

13:49.035 --> 13:51.347
Francis says
that's the hunter.

13:51.382 --> 13:53.108
Well, who's the hunter?

13:53.142 --> 13:55.041
He knew he was coming.

13:55.075 --> 13:56.559
He was on his mind.

13:56.594 --> 14:00.080
So whatever is hidden would have
been on his mind too, right?

14:00.115 --> 14:02.531
Francis wants us
to take that page.

14:04.153 --> 14:06.121
Does he not have
a message for me?

14:06.155 --> 14:08.364
Yes. Give it all to charity.

14:08.399 --> 14:09.952
Make the world a better place.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.438
Bollocks to that!

14:13.473 --> 14:15.993
[intriguing music]

14:22.689 --> 14:24.001
[exhales]

14:26.313 --> 14:28.246
[smacking lips]

14:34.735 --> 14:36.634
[door opens]

14:36.668 --> 14:37.946
Charlie.

14:39.016 --> 14:40.396
Sit down.

14:41.639 --> 14:42.916
It's time.

14:42.951 --> 14:44.124
Er, time?

14:44.159 --> 14:45.263
I need an answer.

14:45.298 --> 14:46.506
Are you going to take the

14:46.540 --> 14:49.164
chief super position
permanently or not?

14:49.198 --> 14:50.475
I, er...

14:50.510 --> 14:53.306
Ah, you and Ray. So similar.

14:53.340 --> 14:54.755
I can give you
the rest of the day

14:54.790 --> 14:57.275
but I need your
answer by tonight.

14:57.310 --> 14:58.518
Okay?

15:01.417 --> 15:02.694
[door opens]

15:03.799 --> 15:05.283
[door closes]

15:06.664 --> 15:08.148
[taps]

15:13.705 --> 15:15.397
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:15.431 --> 15:17.640
You're supposed to
be laying low.

15:17.675 --> 15:20.298
I don't know if
I can do it, Orl.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.714
Just sit around and hope
that your mother-in-law and the

15:22.749 --> 15:26.132
kid find what Francis nicked
before the hunter gets me.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.340
You asked for my help.

15:27.374 --> 15:30.101
This is the best help
I can give you.

15:30.136 --> 15:33.656
Harry is a royal pain
in the arse but she's brilliant.

15:33.691 --> 15:36.452
Jesus, don't ever
tell her I said that.

15:36.487 --> 15:38.316
She's done some
impossible things.

15:38.351 --> 15:40.284
You've gotta trust her.

15:40.318 --> 15:42.424
Well, I trust you.

15:42.458 --> 15:45.358
I had no right to come
here asking you for help

15:45.392 --> 15:46.946
but you helped me anyway.

15:48.844 --> 15:51.191
You are an amazing woman, Orla.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.367
I was such an idiot
for losing you.

15:56.369 --> 15:58.612
I've thought about you
lots over the years.

16:00.097 --> 16:01.822
Did you ever think about me?

16:01.857 --> 16:04.756
Running my fingers
up the length of your back...

16:06.344 --> 16:08.312
stroking the
nape of your neck.

16:11.177 --> 16:12.730
Does it still make you purr?

16:15.802 --> 16:17.183
Ben?

16:18.667 --> 16:20.151
Yes?

16:20.186 --> 16:21.739
If you don't remove
your hand, I'm going to break

16:21.773 --> 16:24.673
those fingers off and
shove them up your arse.

16:27.262 --> 16:30.472
[Orla]
You are unbelievable.

16:30.506 --> 16:34.131
Do you think a few honeyed
words would get me into bed?

16:34.165 --> 16:36.098
I'm in love with my husband.

16:36.133 --> 16:39.791
His mother is out there trying
to save your worthless life.

16:41.517 --> 16:46.764
You are still the same raggedy
boy you were 20 years ago.

16:46.798 --> 16:50.630
Well, the spell was broken
for me after Germany.

16:50.664 --> 16:52.252
Do you get that?

16:52.287 --> 16:53.874
Don't blow it out of proportion.

16:53.909 --> 16:55.635
It was one night in a cell.

16:55.669 --> 16:57.257
I got you out
of there, didn't I?

16:57.292 --> 16:58.500
Yeah.

16:58.534 --> 17:01.710
Which is the only reason
I'm helping you now.

17:01.744 --> 17:05.610
And it wouldn't have happened at
all if you could've run faster.

17:05.645 --> 17:06.646
What?

17:06.680 --> 17:07.957
[laughs]
Oh god.

17:07.992 --> 17:10.374
Okay, saying things like that is
making me question my decision.

17:10.408 --> 17:11.754
Look, that was
a stupid thing to say

17:11.789 --> 17:14.619
and it was a stupid
thing that I did back then.

17:14.654 --> 17:17.484
Look, if it means anything,
I've regretted it ever since.

17:19.107 --> 17:20.522
I am truly sorry.

17:22.213 --> 17:24.284
No, you're not.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.838
You don't know the
meaning of the word.

17:26.873 --> 17:30.152
You're just sorry you
haven't gotten what you wanted.

17:30.187 --> 17:31.878
Now get out of my house!

17:34.225 --> 17:35.571
[sighs]

17:39.541 --> 17:41.543
May I please use the
bathroom before I leave?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.202
Down the hall,
second door on the left.

17:51.415 --> 17:53.693
"May I use your bathroom?"

17:56.627 --> 17:57.869
[Charlie]
Orla?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.838
You home?

18:00.872 --> 18:02.184
What?!

18:02.219 --> 18:03.496
[tense music]

18:03.530 --> 18:04.669
Charlie!

18:04.704 --> 18:06.844
You're home early.
Why? Why are you home?

18:06.878 --> 18:10.296
Vivian wants an answer
about the promotion.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.160
I don't know what to
tell her. Here...

18:12.194 --> 18:13.471
Where are you going?

18:13.506 --> 18:15.197
I'm bursting for a wee.

18:18.580 --> 18:19.719
What?

18:23.309 --> 18:24.896
This is it. The birdhouse.

18:28.555 --> 18:30.316
Told you I knew this place.

18:30.350 --> 18:33.319
See, the house with wings.

18:33.353 --> 18:34.872
Malky comes here all the time.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.356
Through choice?

18:38.358 --> 18:40.326
[Happy]
Are you lost, your majesty?

18:40.360 --> 18:41.672
Disappear.

18:41.706 --> 18:44.364
[instrumental music
on speakers]

18:47.505 --> 18:48.851
You own this too, do you?

18:48.886 --> 18:52.234
Nah, I just like the ambience.

18:52.269 --> 18:54.857
To what do we owe this pleasure?

18:54.892 --> 18:57.550
Do you know a Francis McCluskey?

18:57.584 --> 18:58.827
I do.

18:58.861 --> 19:01.278
Saw him in here about
a week ago in fact.

19:01.312 --> 19:02.969
He was looking for Seamus.

19:03.003 --> 19:05.799
Seamus owns the pub.
Seamus King.

19:05.834 --> 19:06.835
Is he here?

19:06.869 --> 19:08.630
Oh, he's always here.

19:10.977 --> 19:12.185
Dead?

19:12.220 --> 19:15.568
Very. Keeled over, heart attack,

19:15.602 --> 19:17.466
right about where
you're standing now.

19:18.709 --> 19:21.332
Why did Francis want
to meet with him?

19:21.367 --> 19:24.232
I assumed Francis
was up to his old tricks again,

19:24.266 --> 19:26.855
trying to shift some dodgy gear.

19:26.889 --> 19:28.305
Seamus was a fence?

19:30.893 --> 19:33.448
Who'd Francis have gone to next?

19:33.482 --> 19:35.864
That all depends on
what it was he was selling.

19:35.898 --> 19:37.452
Seamus was the daddy,

19:37.486 --> 19:38.970
dabbled in everything.

19:39.005 --> 19:41.387
Most of them specialise.

19:41.421 --> 19:42.940
Specialise?

19:42.974 --> 19:45.356
Well, if he was trying
to clean dirty money,

19:45.391 --> 19:47.910
he might go to this person
or maybe that person.

19:47.945 --> 19:49.843
Jewellery, somebody else.

19:49.878 --> 19:51.638
Art, somebody else.

19:51.673 --> 19:54.779
So it all depended
on what he was selling.

19:54.814 --> 19:57.334
How do we find
out what he stole?

20:00.889 --> 20:02.373
Thank you, Happy.

20:02.408 --> 20:03.719
You have been very helpful.

20:03.754 --> 20:06.446
You're more than welcome,
your highness.

20:13.557 --> 20:14.696
[Fergus]
Now what do we do?

20:14.730 --> 20:15.973
I mean, the only
person who knows

20:16.007 --> 20:17.802
what Francis stole is Francis.

20:17.837 --> 20:21.081
Well, that's, that's
not quite true, is it?

20:21.116 --> 20:23.049
There is someone else
who'll know.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.464
Harry, no!

20:24.499 --> 20:25.879
Thats a terrible idea!

20:29.711 --> 20:31.540
[line ringing]

20:34.129 --> 20:35.613
[Rubén on phone]
Mr. Finnegan.

20:35.648 --> 20:36.752
What a surprise.

20:36.787 --> 20:39.859
I'm calling on
behalf of Mr. Finnegan.

20:39.893 --> 20:42.965
To negotiate the return
of my property, I hope.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.348
Er... yes. Sort of.

20:46.383 --> 20:49.558
What does "sort of" mean?

20:49.593 --> 20:51.940
Mr. Finnegan doesn't
have your property

20:51.974 --> 20:53.907
but were trying to locate it
and it would be very

20:53.942 --> 20:57.048
helpful if you could
tell us exactly what was stolen.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.912
Is this a joke?

20:58.947 --> 21:01.363
No. No, it's not.

21:01.398 --> 21:03.883
Francis hid what
he stole from you.

21:03.917 --> 21:06.506
Ben is determined to return it.

21:06.541 --> 21:09.785
If you would indulge me,
we all get what we want.

21:09.820 --> 21:12.340
[suspenseful music]

21:14.065 --> 21:16.551
Señor Orantes?

21:16.585 --> 21:20.002
I'm trying to work out if I
should find this amusing or not.

21:20.037 --> 21:21.728
To whom am I speaking?

21:23.351 --> 21:25.318
[Harry]
Er, Stella...

21:25.353 --> 21:27.527
Stella Joyce.

21:27.562 --> 21:31.013
Well, Stella,
I will indulge you.

21:31.048 --> 21:34.810
Diamonds. Twelve, emerald cut.

21:34.845 --> 21:37.330
And now maybe
you can indulge me.

21:37.365 --> 21:39.056
Pass on a message.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.885
You have two hours.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.717
After that El Cazador
will do what he does best.

21:44.751 --> 21:46.097
Kill.

21:48.893 --> 21:50.101
Well?

21:51.379 --> 21:53.484
I might have just made it worse.

21:53.519 --> 21:54.727
[sighs]

21:59.904 --> 22:01.527
It was diamonds.

22:01.561 --> 22:04.046
I was just thinking
while you were gone.

22:04.081 --> 22:05.876
The way I remember it,

22:05.910 --> 22:10.398
the last time our paths
crossed, you were in my debt.

22:10.432 --> 22:12.641
I saved your son's life.

22:12.676 --> 22:15.057
And we found
the killer of yours,

22:15.092 --> 22:16.542
I think that makes us even.

22:16.576 --> 22:18.544
But your son still owes me.

22:18.578 --> 22:22.548
No argument with that, but
that's between the two of you.

22:22.582 --> 22:25.896
Yes, but now you need something

22:25.930 --> 22:27.622
and I need something too.

22:28.795 --> 22:30.866
Fella by the name
of Barry Kilcoyne was

22:30.901 --> 22:33.835
arrested a few days ago,
trying to steal a car.

22:33.869 --> 22:36.044
He's my idiot brother-in-law.

22:36.078 --> 22:38.598
You ask your son to
get the charges dropped

22:38.633 --> 22:41.118
and I'll tell you
who Francis went to.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.740
To whom Francis went.

22:43.983 --> 22:45.053
And it's not happening.

22:45.087 --> 22:47.193
Oh, well.

22:47.227 --> 22:49.885
Old Barry will just have
to do his time then.

22:57.755 --> 22:59.136
God, now what do we do?

22:59.170 --> 23:00.827
We need to know that
information, Harry!

23:00.862 --> 23:03.692
I refuse to be
dictated to by that man.

23:03.727 --> 23:06.523
We know lots of people
who know fences.

23:06.557 --> 23:07.731
Come on.

23:11.700 --> 23:14.047
[Glenn]This is a little song
I wrote last night.

23:14.082 --> 23:15.980
But I feel in a lot of ways,

23:16.015 --> 23:18.224
it's still very relevant today.

23:18.258 --> 23:20.122
It's called "Complicated."

23:21.745 --> 23:24.161
♪ I met a girl
she was kind of intense ♪

23:24.195 --> 23:26.094
♪ I said,
are you seeing anybody? ♪

23:26.128 --> 23:28.717
♪ She said, it's complicated

23:28.752 --> 23:31.548
♪ I said, how complicated?

23:31.582 --> 23:33.204
♪ She said,
well if my ex is X and I am Y ♪

23:33.239 --> 23:34.654
♪ Then X squared
plus Y squared ♪

23:34.689 --> 23:37.726
♪ Equals one
over square root of pi! ♪

23:39.694 --> 23:42.455
♪ I said, you're right,
that's pretty complicated ♪

23:42.490 --> 23:46.045
♪ More complicated
than I had anticipated ♪

23:46.079 --> 23:49.876

it leaves me discombobulated ♪

23:54.053 --> 23:55.744
Alright, please yourselves.

23:55.779 --> 23:58.540
No autographs!
I'm going paperless.

23:58.575 --> 23:59.990
Alright, Fergus? Harry?

24:00.024 --> 24:03.269
I've got to go check
on Libs, I'll be back in a mo.

24:03.303 --> 24:05.582
What was that awful song?

24:05.616 --> 24:08.101
Well, it turns out,
you have to have a licence to

24:08.136 --> 24:11.898
do karaoke in a public
place like this, Harry.

24:11.933 --> 24:13.831
Costs an absolute fortune.

24:13.866 --> 24:15.799
So, I sat down,

24:15.833 --> 24:18.249
I said, I'll rack
my brains and sure enough,

24:18.284 --> 24:19.734
I had a brain wave!

24:19.768 --> 24:21.080
I'll write my own songs

24:21.114 --> 24:22.495
and that way they're free.

24:22.530 --> 24:25.187
Bloody genius, eh?
Ha ha!

24:25.222 --> 24:26.810
Only got two at the mo,

24:26.844 --> 24:28.743
but I'm trying
to come up with more.

24:28.777 --> 24:31.539
Now, what rhymes
with otter spatula?

24:31.573 --> 24:32.505
Moron.

24:32.540 --> 24:33.886
[whispering indistinctly]

24:33.920 --> 24:35.059
Nah, it doesn't rhyme.

24:36.613 --> 24:39.857
Glenn, get me a drink.
I need to pick your brain.

24:39.892 --> 24:41.100
Right you are.

24:41.134 --> 24:42.757
If you have one.

24:44.103 --> 24:46.588
[mellow music]

24:51.213 --> 24:52.732
Hello, Malky.

24:54.147 --> 24:55.735
Thanks for agreeing to this.

24:57.219 --> 24:59.705
I'm not sure
it's the right decision.

24:59.739 --> 25:01.292
I promised Fergus.

25:03.053 --> 25:06.021
But there's every chance I might
get up and leave any moment.

25:06.056 --> 25:07.333
I understand.

25:07.367 --> 25:08.921
I'm grateful.

25:08.955 --> 25:10.301
I need to thank you.

25:10.336 --> 25:12.683
Thank me for what?

25:12.718 --> 25:17.067
Fergus and Liberty
are exceptional

25:17.101 --> 25:19.552
and it's down to you.

25:19.587 --> 25:21.865
I'd like to take
the credit for it, but

25:21.899 --> 25:23.867
mostly it's down
to Fergus himself.

25:25.696 --> 25:27.560
We did something
right with that boy.

25:28.699 --> 25:29.769
Yeah.

25:35.637 --> 25:37.812
I'm so sorry

25:37.846 --> 25:39.538
for what I did.

25:43.852 --> 25:46.614
I suspect I'm not the
easiest person to live with.

25:48.167 --> 25:49.409
Maybe top five though.

25:49.444 --> 25:51.411
[laughs]

25:51.446 --> 25:52.585
Yeah.

25:53.690 --> 25:56.244
[Glenn]
Ooh, could be him.

25:56.278 --> 25:57.763
- What's up with Glenn?
- Steven?

25:57.797 --> 25:59.937
He looks like
he's about to shit himself!

25:59.972 --> 26:01.283
He's thinking.

26:01.318 --> 26:05.391
There was a Keith something.
Or was it Kevin?

26:05.425 --> 26:06.323
[sighs]

26:06.357 --> 26:09.222
I've asked him to find fences.

26:09.257 --> 26:10.983
Now we may have
to go somewhere else.

26:11.017 --> 26:12.294
I know!

26:12.329 --> 26:14.745
I'll ring my pal, Jimmy Bread.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.126
He'll know.

26:16.160 --> 26:18.093
Here, he, erm...

26:18.128 --> 26:19.923
He wouldn't happen to have

26:19.957 --> 26:22.684
a moustache shaped
like that, now, would he?

26:22.719 --> 26:25.756
[Glenn]Exactly like that
and that's a loaf of bread!

26:25.791 --> 26:27.137
That's funny, that is.

26:29.173 --> 26:33.074
You know, Tampa's no Dublin,
but it's hot and sunny.

26:33.108 --> 26:34.903
You could come over and visit.

26:34.938 --> 26:36.422
Have you got your passport?

26:36.456 --> 26:37.734
[sighs]

26:37.768 --> 26:39.114
I couldn't tell you
if it's even in date.

26:39.149 --> 26:40.460
Probably not.

26:40.495 --> 26:42.221
[both laugh]

26:42.255 --> 26:43.774
What about the kids?

26:45.086 --> 26:47.260
Do you still
have that biscuit tin

26:47.295 --> 26:48.468
of your vital documents?

26:48.503 --> 26:49.746
Oh.

26:49.780 --> 26:51.333
I still have it.

26:51.368 --> 26:53.404
Couldn't tell you
where it is, now.

26:53.439 --> 26:56.373
Probably the
lounge cupboard I'd say.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.444
The kids have never been abroad.

26:58.478 --> 27:01.171
I should really start thinking
about doing that sometime.

27:03.345 --> 27:06.314
Travel is good
for the soul, so they say.

27:09.973 --> 27:12.700
I just have to use
the little boy's room.

gone right through me.

Any way you slice it, that's me.

27:42.799 --> 27:45.871
Glenn said you need some
help with a sensitive matter?

27:45.905 --> 27:48.356
We need to talk about
Francis McCluskey.

27:50.185 --> 27:52.394
I'll get the drinks.

27:52.429 --> 27:55.018
McCluskey, you say?

27:55.052 --> 27:57.089
Nah, nah, don't know the name.

27:57.123 --> 27:58.746
Can't help.

27:58.780 --> 28:02.404
- He's dead.
- Murdered by El Cazador.

28:05.787 --> 28:09.446
Killed for the diamonds that he
came to see you about recently.

28:10.965 --> 28:13.036
Did he tell you that he, er,

28:13.070 --> 28:15.555
stole them from Rubén Orantes?

28:15.590 --> 28:16.729
No, he didn't!

28:16.764 --> 28:19.352
Had he, I wouldn't have
touched them with a barge pole.

28:19.387 --> 28:22.010
El Cazador is
in Dublin to get them back.

28:22.045 --> 28:24.461
Right now he's looking
for Francis' business partner.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.946
And when he kills him,
he won't just give up.

28:26.981 --> 28:29.328
He'll move onto
Francis' widow, Maura,

28:29.362 --> 28:30.743
and then you.

28:30.778 --> 28:32.745
Do you have them?

28:32.780 --> 28:34.126
I don't.

28:37.198 --> 28:39.407
Francis came to see me twice.

28:39.441 --> 28:41.236
First to show me
the merchandise.

28:41.271 --> 28:42.548
Left one with me.

28:42.582 --> 28:45.551
I made some calls.
Found a buyer in London.

28:45.585 --> 28:47.967
Then he came back
and said he'd changed his mind.

28:48.002 --> 28:50.038
Didn't want to go through
with the deal anymore.

28:50.073 --> 28:51.799
Took the diamonds and left.

28:53.386 --> 28:55.457
In hindsight, he was nervous.

28:55.492 --> 28:56.735
Scared.

28:58.012 --> 28:59.945
Well, he knew the
hunter was after him.

29:02.464 --> 29:05.916
Do you have any idea what he
might have done with them then?

29:05.951 --> 29:08.781
A girlfriend was gonna
to look after them, he said.

29:08.816 --> 29:10.438
He had a girlfriend?

29:10.472 --> 29:12.336
I found it odd, too.

29:12.371 --> 29:13.821
I knew he had a young wife.

29:13.855 --> 29:15.926
Was always besotted with her,
but...

29:16.996 --> 29:19.240

Besotted was the word.

30:43.980 --> 30:45.291
So we heard.

30:45.326 --> 30:48.398
It was diamonds,
by the way. Twelve diamonds.

a current girlfriend?

30:57.303 --> 30:58.926
What if it was an ex?

30:58.960 --> 31:00.651
Would he trust an ex
enough to leave

31:02.170 --> 31:03.447
Sheila McGill, he would.

He trusts her implicitly.

35:24.605 --> 35:26.952
Mm. Well, that's
Saint Brigid of Kildare.

35:26.986 --> 35:29.851
He was definitely
punching above his weight.

35:29.886 --> 35:32.199
So what's your plan then?

35:32.233 --> 35:33.855
Like I'm gonna tell you.

35:33.890 --> 35:35.340
Run along now,

35:35.374 --> 35:37.376
our services are
no longer required.

35:37.411 --> 35:38.515
[Fergus]What, you think
we're just gonna let

35:38.550 --> 35:41.173
you walk off
with those diamonds?

35:41.208 --> 35:43.693
Who's going
to stop me, kid? You?

35:45.212 --> 35:46.558
[arrow whizzing]

35:47.248 --> 35:48.353
Don't move!

35:48.387 --> 35:49.733
[Harry]
Orla!

35:52.874 --> 35:54.911
Argh!

35:54.945 --> 35:57.224
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

35:57.258 --> 35:58.949
This is not good, Harry.
He's got a crossbow.

35:58.984 --> 36:01.262
- I know, I know. I can see that.
- He's got a crossbow!

36:01.297 --> 36:02.643
- Stop!
- Okay!

36:02.677 --> 36:04.955
That was a warning shot,
Señor Fennigan.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.543
The next one
will be a kill shot.

36:06.578 --> 36:08.338
Please hand over what you stole.

36:09.788 --> 36:12.687
Mr. Fennigan, please come out
from behind the statue.

36:12.722 --> 36:16.243
I have many arrows.
I will shoot your friends,

36:16.277 --> 36:17.727
one by one,

36:17.761 --> 36:21.040
then you, if you do
not give me what I want.

36:21.075 --> 36:22.835
We're not his friends, actually.

36:22.870 --> 36:24.320
That is irrelevant.

36:25.459 --> 36:27.219
I am going to count to ten.

36:28.082 --> 36:29.359
Uno...

36:29.394 --> 36:31.016
- What are you doing?
- Harry!

36:31.050 --> 36:33.639
Mr. Miralles, were trying
to find your diamonds for you.

36:33.674 --> 36:36.470
If you'd be so kind
as to lower your weapon?

36:36.504 --> 36:38.610
Not my diamonds, my employer's.

36:38.644 --> 36:40.646
Yeah, I know that.
I spoke to him.

36:40.681 --> 36:42.855
Erm... I just have a question.

36:44.305 --> 36:46.065
What, what's his name?

36:46.100 --> 36:48.067
Ben Fennigan.

36:48.102 --> 36:49.655
And how would
you be spelling that?

36:50.829 --> 36:53.314
F-E-N-N-I...

36:53.349 --> 36:56.075
Just as I thought.
He didn't kill Francis.

36:56.110 --> 36:58.699
- You did, Ben.
- No, I didn't.

36:58.733 --> 37:00.804
The name stamped on
the arrow you supposedly

37:00.839 --> 37:03.462
found in your front door
was spelled correctly.

37:03.497 --> 37:05.361
You steal the diamonds too?

37:05.395 --> 37:08.329
Were you and Francis
in on it together?

37:08.364 --> 37:09.744
My guess is you did

37:09.779 --> 37:12.091
and then you
found out that Orantes

37:12.126 --> 37:14.335
had sent in the hunter.

37:14.370 --> 37:15.750
Well, that's
when Francis baulked,

37:15.785 --> 37:17.511
realised what
a mistake you'd made

37:17.545 --> 37:19.064
and decided to give them back,

37:19.098 --> 37:21.377
hoping Orantes
would forgive him.

37:21.411 --> 37:24.276
Which is why he stopped
the deal with Jimmy Bread.

37:24.311 --> 37:26.761
And why you killed
Francis with a crossbow.

37:26.796 --> 37:28.384
I mean, what, a hitman
with a crossbow was

37:28.418 --> 37:30.455
en route and
who would think it was you

37:30.489 --> 37:32.836
when we'd all heard
El Cazador was here.

37:32.871 --> 37:36.046
[Harry]You thought you'd just
grab the diamonds and vanish.

37:36.081 --> 37:37.876
Then when you
went to look for them,

37:37.910 --> 37:40.534
you discovered that
Francis had moved them.

37:40.568 --> 37:43.537
You knew the hunter'd be here
sooner rather than later,

37:43.571 --> 37:45.884
so you needed to find out
what Francis had done with them,

37:45.918 --> 37:48.300
and fast, which
is where we come in.

37:48.335 --> 37:50.371
Oh, you don't write the name on

37:50.406 --> 37:51.821
your arrows by
any chance, do you?

37:51.855 --> 37:54.858
- Why would I do that?
- No, exactly.

37:54.893 --> 37:57.758
I honestly didn't think you
had it in you, Ben.

37:57.792 --> 37:59.932
You're worse
than I ever realised.

37:59.967 --> 38:01.451
Enough of this!

38:02.694 --> 38:05.352
All I want is the diamonds
and I will leave.

38:07.112 --> 38:08.631
Uno...

38:09.770 --> 38:10.874
Dos...

38:10.909 --> 38:14.050
Hey! Woah, woah! Wait!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Hey, hey, hey!

38:14.084 --> 38:17.364
Look, I think I might
have been wrong.

38:17.398 --> 38:19.538
- I don't think they're here.
- Tres...

38:19.573 --> 38:20.850
Harry, the drawing.

38:20.884 --> 38:22.783
What if it's not
a star but a diamond?

38:24.578 --> 38:26.096
[Alejandro]
Cuatro...

38:26.131 --> 38:27.960
She's looking at the diamonds.

38:27.995 --> 38:29.376
[Alejandro]
Cinco...

38:29.410 --> 38:31.067
Oh, Mr hunter, sir.
Permission to move.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.482
Seis...

38:36.141 --> 38:37.487
siete...

38:38.557 --> 38:39.731
ocho...

38:42.078 --> 38:44.080
nueve...

38:44.114 --> 38:45.771
I've found them!
I've found them!

38:45.806 --> 38:47.359
Diez...

38:47.394 --> 38:48.809
He found them.

38:51.881 --> 38:55.022
Hey, hey! Put them back
in the bag, please.

38:55.056 --> 38:56.817
Alright, alright!

38:56.851 --> 38:59.371
[tense music]

39:06.620 --> 39:09.864
Where do you think you're going?
You just killed a man!

39:09.899 --> 39:11.797
Ugh! Ugh!

39:11.832 --> 39:13.385
Excuse me, can
I take that please?

39:13.420 --> 39:14.593
Oh, be my guest.

39:14.628 --> 39:15.905
[coughs]

39:17.907 --> 39:18.873
[arrow whizzing]

39:18.908 --> 39:20.565
[screaming]

39:21.911 --> 39:23.050
Oh, Orla!

39:23.084 --> 39:24.500
[groaning]

39:24.534 --> 39:26.087
- Thank you.
- Welcome!

39:27.192 --> 39:28.952
God, I need to learn
how to fight!

39:28.987 --> 39:33.578
Jesus! My arse! Argh! Aaargh!

39:33.612 --> 39:36.546
We need to get you
some boxing lessons.

39:36.581 --> 39:37.858
[Harry]Oh, time to
call in the guards, I think.

39:37.892 --> 39:39.204
It's all going
to come out, isn't it?

39:39.238 --> 39:40.895
Charlie's going to find out.

39:40.930 --> 39:43.139
This is Wicklow.
We'll call in the locals.

39:43.173 --> 39:45.590
Ben'll tell him
just to spite me.

39:47.454 --> 39:48.938
Leave that with me.

39:51.147 --> 39:52.562
Ah...

39:52.597 --> 39:54.530
how do you have free
run of the station?

39:55.703 --> 39:58.775
Happy's calling in his favour.

39:58.810 --> 40:00.639
I never agreed to that.

40:00.674 --> 40:02.883
Well, he did save your life

40:02.917 --> 40:05.195
and what he wants isn't too bad.

40:05.230 --> 40:07.508
I've never done a favour
for a criminal before.

40:07.543 --> 40:09.855
I know, dear, but there's
a first time for everything.

40:09.890 --> 40:11.098
[sighs]

40:11.132 --> 40:13.100
And if you help him out,

40:13.134 --> 40:15.067
Happy'll do me a favour.

40:15.102 --> 40:16.828
Why do you

40:16.862 --> 40:19.037
need a favour from a loan shark?

40:19.071 --> 40:21.557
No! I don't want to know.
Just...

40:21.591 --> 40:23.662
Just tell me what I have to do.

40:25.112 --> 40:26.285
[sighs]

40:26.320 --> 40:28.840
[indistinct chattering]

40:34.880 --> 40:36.468
Where's Orla?

40:36.503 --> 40:38.539
Oh, Orla won't
be coming to see you.

40:38.574 --> 40:41.508
Ah... that's a shame.

40:41.542 --> 40:44.511
I guess my next visitor
will be your son.

40:44.545 --> 40:47.168
I'd say he'd be very interested
to know who he's married to.

40:47.203 --> 40:49.654
To whom he's married.

40:49.688 --> 40:51.863
Actually, your next
visitor's already here.

40:57.178 --> 40:59.077
Can't stay long.

40:59.111 --> 41:01.493
I'm not actually here
to see you.

41:01.528 --> 41:04.841
I'm here to visit
my cousin, Digby.

41:04.876 --> 41:07.810
Digby, this is Ben.

41:07.844 --> 41:10.226
I bet he makes
your tummy flutter.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.779
[giggles]

41:13.850 --> 41:17.647
Digby is going to be your
new best friend in here, Ben.

41:17.682 --> 41:20.892
So, if you so much
as utter the name Orla Wild,

41:20.926 --> 41:22.756
you'll have to let us know

41:22.790 --> 41:24.930
because we'll need
to get new hats for the wedding.

41:26.932 --> 41:28.727
Do we understand each other?

41:30.936 --> 41:32.317
Good boy.

41:34.768 --> 41:36.252
Should we invite Harry
to the restaurant?

41:36.286 --> 41:38.530
Well, it's up to you.
It's your celebration.

41:38.565 --> 41:40.774
She just wanted to say
a quick well-done.

41:44.053 --> 41:46.020
Hey, hey...
why's the door open?

41:46.055 --> 41:47.677
[intense music]

41:49.610 --> 41:50.715
Stay back.

41:52.095 --> 41:53.545
Ma?

42:02.830 --> 42:05.212
[all]
Surprise!

42:05.246 --> 42:06.903
[all cheering]

42:08.767 --> 42:11.356
- What's this?
- Is this okay?

42:11.390 --> 42:13.910
I thought you might
like it more than a stuffy meal.

42:13.945 --> 42:15.015
Aw.

42:15.049 --> 42:16.741
It was Harry's idea.

42:16.775 --> 42:19.744
Well done, Charlie!
You deserve it.

42:19.778 --> 42:21.090
Thanks, Ma.

42:21.124 --> 42:22.609
[indistinct chattering]

42:22.643 --> 42:23.851
Hey.

42:23.886 --> 42:26.060
Hey, I, um, didn't know
if I should be here

42:26.095 --> 42:28.269
but Harry insisted. So...

42:28.304 --> 42:30.617
Something weird's
happening with my mam.

42:30.651 --> 42:32.688
Yeah. Out of the blue,
she's decided

42:32.722 --> 42:34.828
she's changed her mind about us.

42:34.862 --> 42:36.277
We can see each other
with her blessing.

42:36.312 --> 42:37.658
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:37.693 --> 42:39.936
[both laughing]

42:45.010 --> 42:46.805
Did I miss something?

42:46.840 --> 42:48.289
Probably.

42:48.324 --> 42:50.084
I do all the time.

42:50.119 --> 42:51.810
Huh.

42:51.845 --> 42:53.432
[indistinct chattering]

42:53.467 --> 42:55.227
[laughing]

42:55.262 --> 42:57.782
[theme music]
