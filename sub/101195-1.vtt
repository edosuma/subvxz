00:00.505 --> 00:04.172
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:19.751 --> 01:22.334
(bell chiming)

01:38.052 --> 01:40.490
(soft piano music)

01:40.490 --> 01:42.693
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.643
- Confess your sins, son.

01:47.486 --> 01:49.040
- I can't.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.130
You told me not to tell you
things that I can't take back.

01:51.130 --> 01:53.163
- Julius, I understand.

01:54.230 --> 01:55.840
What is bothering you today?

01:55.840 --> 01:56.673
- Everything.

01:57.637 --> 02:00.833
I'm having a hard time trying
to understand how to deal.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.743
My daughter hasn't come home.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.312
I'm not quite sure if she ever will.

02:10.340 --> 02:12.190
I'm having terrible thoughts, Father,

02:13.040 --> 02:15.823
terrible thoughts that
I just can't understand.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.653
- Your daughter will find her way.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.633
The Lord will give you strength.

02:23.840 --> 02:28.840
Let me read you a verse, Proverb 29:11,

02:28.847 --> 02:32.033
"Fools give full vent to their rages,

02:32.950 --> 02:35.807
but the wise bring calm in the end."

02:37.960 --> 02:39.850
- I know in my heart
that I have to forgive,

02:39.850 --> 02:41.933
but I don't know who to forgive.

02:44.210 --> 02:48.160
I'm gonna do something
bad, something real bad.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.693
- Think, before you do.

02:52.700 --> 02:53.850
May God bless you, son.

02:57.758 --> 02:59.120
(Julius sighs)

02:59.120 --> 03:00.640
- Oh my God.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.620
I'm heartily sorry for
having offended thee

03:02.620 --> 03:04.260
and I detest all my sins

03:04.260 --> 03:07.170
because I dread the laws of
heaven and the pains of hell,

03:07.170 --> 03:09.690
but most of all, because of
having offended thee, my God,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.510
who art all good and
deserving of all my love.

03:11.510 --> 03:13.780
I firmly resolve, with
the help of thy Grace,

03:13.780 --> 03:18.170
to confess my sins, to do
penance, and to amend my life.

03:18.170 --> 03:19.180
Amen.

03:19.180 --> 03:20.013
- Amen.

03:21.707 --> 03:24.874
(Julius sighs softly)

03:28.794 --> 03:31.913
- I never showed emotion like the others.

03:33.110 --> 03:34.513
'Cause they were weak.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.080
My heart may have skipped a beat,

03:37.080 --> 03:38.580
when I heard she went missing.

03:40.530 --> 03:42.483
She wasn't so perfect.

03:44.460 --> 03:48.843
In fact, in my eyes, she
wasn't perfect at all.

03:51.750 --> 03:52.753
I loved my daughter.

03:54.710 --> 03:58.777
But I knew, deep down inside,
the girl never loved me.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.370
They say, what makes
a woman an angry woman

04:06.258 --> 04:10.883
is another woman who destroys her family.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.793
You have made me very, very angry.

04:21.003 --> 04:24.420
(somber, dramatic music)

04:33.498 --> 04:37.415
(suspenseful orchestral music)

05:00.503 --> 05:03.253
(dramatic music)

05:14.737 --> 05:17.690
Mary Louise, it is Marcia.

05:17.690 --> 05:21.203
Your appointment was at
11, and it is now 11:45.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.020
You know, I have three
people waiting on your turn.

05:26.020 --> 05:29.950
Three people, just dying to have a reading

05:29.950 --> 05:31.800
with Madam Marcia.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.740
So kindly call me back, woman,

05:33.740 --> 05:35.450
or I swear on the baby Jesus,

05:35.450 --> 05:40.300
I will never, ever give
you a reading again,

05:40.300 --> 05:41.133
bitch.

05:44.020 --> 05:47.090
Stupid bitch.

05:47.090 --> 05:48.460
Everybody wants a reading.

05:48.460 --> 05:50.070
Oh, tell me your fortune.

05:50.070 --> 05:51.428
What's my fortune?

05:51.428 --> 05:53.007
Am I gonna be rich?

05:53.007 --> 05:54.057
Am I gonna be pretty?

05:55.154 --> 05:57.053
How the hell do you do this shit?

05:59.229 --> 06:00.396
Answer, quick.

06:02.420 --> 06:03.694
What does tomorrow hold for...

06:03.694 --> 06:05.127
What the hell?

06:05.127 --> 06:08.473
(gentle dramatic music)

06:08.473 --> 06:10.413
- Good morning, Julius.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.233
- Joel.

06:13.468 --> 06:17.310
(knocking on pool table)

06:17.310 --> 06:19.540
Can I help you with something?

06:19.540 --> 06:22.430
- I was hoping you heard
something from the police.

06:22.430 --> 06:24.450
- You know, how these boys work.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.363
Louisiana time, slow as shit.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.060
I ain't heard nothing, so
you ain't gonna hear nothing.

06:31.060 --> 06:33.150
- Don't you think this is a little odd?

06:33.150 --> 06:34.060
- What is?

06:34.060 --> 06:34.940
- Not a single word.

06:34.940 --> 06:36.460
It's been three weeks.

06:36.460 --> 06:37.670
It doesn't look good,

06:37.670 --> 06:39.620
I don't have a good feeling about this.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.653
We gotta do something!

06:43.615 --> 06:44.830
- Well, shit, Joel.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.100
Maybe you should take your ass

06:46.100 --> 06:48.570
and look for your son yourself.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.470
What the hell do you want from me?

06:50.470 --> 06:51.947
My daughter is missing too.

06:54.319 --> 06:57.050
The law ain't gonna help us.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.490
The town ain't gonna help us.

06:59.490 --> 07:01.003
But I'm gonna help myself.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.534
(pool ball thuds)

07:07.534 --> 07:10.701

07:44.230 --> 07:46.700
You scream and I'll chew your face off.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.843
Don't scream.

07:49.023 --> 07:50.950
I wanna ask you a few questions.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.920
I just want answers.

07:52.920 --> 07:56.000
Make it quick and simple
and we can move on.

07:56.000 --> 07:56.858
Agreed?

07:56.858 --> 07:59.358
(Stan groans)

08:01.093 --> 08:02.572
(tape ripping)

08:02.572 --> 08:03.405
- Help!

08:03.405 --> 08:04.238
Hel-
(punch thwacks)

08:04.238 --> 08:05.221
(Stan groans)

08:05.221 --> 08:07.570
- I told you not to
scream, you little prick.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.121
Why would you ever wanna make this hard?

08:10.121 --> 08:11.940
(Stan groaning)

08:11.940 --> 08:13.383
I hate people like you.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.290
You see?

08:16.290 --> 08:18.640
I'm giving you a chance!

08:18.640 --> 08:22.263
A chance to talk, to plead your case.

08:26.454 --> 08:27.778
(punch smacks)

08:27.778 --> 08:30.445
(Stan groaning)

08:31.823 --> 08:33.114
(Stan coughing)

08:33.114 --> 08:34.693
- I didn't scream.

08:34.693 --> 08:36.486
- [Julius] I know.

08:36.486 --> 08:38.126
- Then why'd you hit me?

08:38.126 --> 08:39.475
- [Julius] Reflexes.

08:39.475 --> 08:40.308
- I didn't scream.

08:40.308 --> 08:42.947
- [Julius] I know, that's
why I didn't hit you again.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.883
- [Stan] Sir, I didn't do
anything to your daughter.

08:55.253 --> 08:57.850
(fly swatter swooshing)

08:57.850 --> 08:59.223
You got this all wrong.

09:01.446 --> 09:02.403
- You lie.

09:03.381 --> 09:06.023
(chuckling) I don't make mistakes.

09:06.870 --> 09:10.063
Well, I do, but in this case, I ain't.

09:13.729 --> 09:17.020
(sighs) You see, my
daughter's gone missing.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.320
It's been four months now.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.983
The police haven't found nothing.

09:23.350 --> 09:26.930
That private-eye I hired
hasn't found nothing.

09:26.930 --> 09:31.930
This leaves you, the last
person her mother saw her with.

09:32.028 --> 09:33.100
(Stan sniffs)

09:33.100 --> 09:34.853
You must understand the situation.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.680
I mean, what would you do?

09:38.680 --> 09:40.703
- Sir, there are people looking for me.

09:41.660 --> 09:44.100
My mom, my dad, I know,

09:44.100 --> 09:46.740
and when they find out what you did...

09:46.740 --> 09:48.170
- No they won't.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.033
No one will.

09:50.180 --> 09:54.063
See, I has a note typed
up to your parents.

09:55.780 --> 09:58.520
A note that states that
you were taking off,

09:58.520 --> 10:00.423
moving to bigger and better places.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.290
I had that private detective

10:03.290 --> 10:05.283
on your school records and so forth.

10:06.374 --> 10:10.621
Nothing higher than a C,
but tons of D's in school.

10:10.621 --> 10:12.610
(Julius laughing)

10:12.610 --> 10:14.957
He found out, your school.

10:14.957 --> 10:17.630
And your parents, Edna and, and, and...

10:17.630 --> 10:19.030
- And Joel.

10:19.030 --> 10:20.940
- Joel. (chuckles)

10:20.940 --> 10:23.080
They were contacted
multiple times to come in

10:23.080 --> 10:26.083
and work out your
suspensions, but nothing.

10:27.575 --> 10:32.513
Word around town is, they
haven't reported it yet,

10:33.570 --> 10:34.620
or just ain't asking.

10:36.170 --> 10:38.820
No, I'm pretty sure they
don't give a shit about you.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.180
- What are you gonna do to me?

10:48.008 --> 10:49.110
(fly swatter clatters)

10:49.110 --> 10:53.023
- Well, that depends on you.

10:54.580 --> 10:57.233
In turn, I'm depending on you.

10:58.980 --> 11:02.220
Now tell me, where is my daughter?

11:02.220 --> 11:03.850
- I don't know.
(chains jangling)

11:03.850 --> 11:05.677
- See, that's not gonna help me.

11:05.677 --> 11:08.173
- I don't know how I can help you.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.870
- I'm trying to be nice here.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.370
I'm giving you opportunities.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.903
We're negotiating.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.990
There's gonna be some give,
there's gonna be some take.

11:27.473 --> 11:28.794
(dramatic music)

11:28.794 --> 11:30.598
(Stan whimpers)

11:30.598 --> 11:32.765
Did you kill my Annabelle?

11:34.064 --> 11:36.242
Where is my daughter?

11:36.242 --> 11:37.492
- I don't know.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.782
- I'm running out of patience, fast.

11:43.806 --> 11:47.306
Soon, Stan, very soon, I'm gonna kill you.

11:49.103 --> 11:49.936
- No.

11:51.198 --> 11:53.174
(punch smacking)
(Stan groaning)

11:53.174 --> 11:56.219
(Stan coughing)

11:56.219 --> 11:58.886
(kick smacking)

11:59.736 --> 12:02.403
(Stan groaning)

12:09.988 --> 12:11.582
(hand slapping)

12:11.582 --> 12:14.249
(Stan groaning)

12:16.606 --> 12:18.527
(Stan growling)

12:18.527 --> 12:20.678
(chain jangling)

12:20.678 --> 12:23.803
(Stan breathing heavily)

12:23.803 --> 12:26.970
(slow dramatic music)

12:30.568 --> 12:32.468
- Baby, ain't you gonna eat your food?

12:34.162 --> 12:35.556
- I'm not hungry.

12:35.556 --> 12:37.630
- Well, I made, I made all your favorites.

12:37.630 --> 12:40.263
- I'll put it away, have it later.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.643
- So how was work today?

12:47.560 --> 12:48.393
- Didn't go.

12:50.339 --> 12:52.300
- Well, where'd you go.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.150
- Does it matter?

12:55.140 --> 12:57.270
What is it with all the questions, woman?

12:57.270 --> 12:58.620
- You went back, didn't ya?

13:00.560 --> 13:02.823
You went back to the
goddamn cemetery, hmm?

13:04.710 --> 13:07.258
She is not even there.

13:07.258 --> 13:08.353
(sighs)

13:08.353 --> 13:10.503
When are you gonna stop
with all this, huh?

13:11.730 --> 13:12.820
You keep putting her there, in your mind,

13:12.820 --> 13:14.621
and that ain't good.

13:14.621 --> 13:15.627
- (sighs) What is wrong with you, huh?

13:15.627 --> 13:17.643
Why can't you leave me alone?

13:18.890 --> 13:20.013
I just wanna grieve.

13:21.530 --> 13:26.530
I just want this thing,
this feeling to pass,

13:26.780 --> 13:29.870
so I can go on with my
life, and you with yours.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.010
- It doesn't make sense.

13:32.010 --> 13:33.800
It doesn't.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.530
You are ruining us.

13:36.530 --> 13:39.973
Okay, whatever it is we have
left, you are destroying it.

13:41.428 --> 13:43.350
(sighs) Hell, you think
we are the only family

13:43.350 --> 13:44.900
that this has ever happened to, huh?

13:44.900 --> 13:47.700
- What a horrible, evil thing to say.

13:47.700 --> 13:50.430
We may not be the only people
that this has happened to,

13:50.430 --> 13:52.193
but this has never happened to me.

13:55.882 --> 13:58.011
- Babe, we're gonna find a way.

13:58.011 --> 13:58.844
Okay?

13:58.844 --> 13:59.677
- A way to what?

14:01.120 --> 14:02.403
Bring our daughter back?

14:05.300 --> 14:06.333
Could be dead,

14:08.980 --> 14:10.833
rotting in some ditch somewhere,

14:12.450 --> 14:15.040
with some asshole, who killed
her, pissing on her grave

14:15.040 --> 14:16.593
every day, just for fun.

14:18.806 --> 14:20.836
How could you not be furious?

14:20.836 --> 14:22.220
- Don't, don't say that.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.833
Okay, don't you talk like that.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.847
- I can't take it, Marcia, I just can't.

14:30.568 --> 14:32.735
The world is full of scum.

14:37.160 --> 14:40.258
I just can't stop thinking about it,

14:40.258 --> 14:43.990
thinking about what our
daughter might've gone through.

14:43.990 --> 14:45.810
- It's gonna be all right, okay?

14:45.810 --> 14:48.449
I promise you, it is gonna be all right.

14:48.449 --> 14:51.146
It's going to be all
right, okay, I promise you.

14:51.146 --> 14:52.540
I promise, it's going to be all right.

14:52.540 --> 14:53.944
- [Julius] Oh, thank you.

14:53.944 --> 14:55.980
- Gonna be all right.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.871
(knocking on door)

14:58.871 --> 15:01.833
- They are always on time.

15:01.833 --> 15:05.513
Please, Lord, let them
have a lead, an answer.

15:10.060 --> 15:10.970
John Mcglone.

15:10.970 --> 15:12.710
- Good evening, Julius.

15:12.710 --> 15:14.330
Good evening, ma'am.
- John.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.230
- So what's the story, Detective?

15:17.230 --> 15:19.740
Please tell me you have
some news for my wife and I.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.960
- Well, I haven't found your daughter yet,

15:21.960 --> 15:24.770
but I did stumble on a
few leads that might help.

15:24.770 --> 15:26.710
Now, apart from what we
spoke about last week,

15:26.710 --> 15:28.090
about the boyfriend,

15:28.090 --> 15:30.280
you know, Stan, the one that went missing,

15:30.280 --> 15:31.730
I did get to speak to his parents

15:31.730 --> 15:34.912
and, unfortunately, they
haven't heard anything.

15:34.912 --> 15:37.499
As a matter of fact, it doesn't
even seem like they care.

15:37.499 --> 15:39.000
(Julius scoffs)

15:39.000 --> 15:42.120
And your daughter's bag, her ID was found,

15:42.120 --> 15:43.990
along with some cash.

15:43.990 --> 15:45.410
- You found my daughter's bag?

15:45.410 --> 15:47.130
What the hell, man, when?

15:47.130 --> 15:48.910
- Well, take it easy,
it was just yesterday

15:48.910 --> 15:50.520
and we had to run the routine.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.750
You know, we had to do fingerprints,

15:51.750 --> 15:53.093
and forensics, and so forth.

15:53.093 --> 15:54.940
- Well, what did ya find?

15:54.940 --> 15:56.500
- Unfortunately, nothing.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.890
- How could there be nothing?

15:57.890 --> 15:59.950
- Well, it looks like the
bag was basically untouched

15:59.950 --> 16:01.440
and nothing was taken out.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.340
It was as if the bag was just dropped.

16:03.340 --> 16:05.433
- Are you ever gonna find our daughter?

16:06.610 --> 16:08.017
Hmm?

16:08.017 --> 16:09.530
- Ma'am, you gotta believe me,

16:09.530 --> 16:10.780
I'm doing the best I can.

16:12.660 --> 16:13.493
Are you okay?

16:13.493 --> 16:15.584
Is there something you need to tell me?

16:15.584 --> 16:17.732
- Oh no, I'm, (chuckles) I'm fine.

16:17.732 --> 16:19.010
I'm fine.

16:19.010 --> 16:21.906
- So what happens next?

16:21.906 --> 16:24.540
- Well, what'll happen
next is, I'll be back,

16:24.540 --> 16:27.050
of course, if I have more to tell you.

16:27.050 --> 16:30.140
In the meantime, I just
need you to sign the forms.

16:30.140 --> 16:32.340
You know, let's the
department know I was here,

16:32.340 --> 16:34.020
what we discussed, and
that you understand.

16:34.020 --> 16:35.315
- Of course.
(pen clicking)

16:35.315 --> 16:38.565
- If you could sign right here, please.

16:44.593 --> 16:45.675
- [Julius] Thanks.

16:45.675 --> 16:47.038
- Thank you.

16:47.038 --> 16:48.530
We'll be in touch.
(Julius sighing)

16:48.530 --> 16:49.470
- [Marcia] All right.

16:49.470 --> 16:51.170
You have a nice night, now.
- John.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.170
- You too, ma'am.

16:52.170 --> 16:53.003
- Thanks, Officer.

16:53.003 --> 16:54.100
- You're welcome, sir.

16:57.069 --> 16:58.045
(Marcia sighing)

16:58.045 --> 16:59.462
- Okay. Whatever.

17:00.723 --> 17:03.556
(stairs creaking)

17:06.683 --> 17:10.183
(soft, suspenseful music)

17:10.183 --> 17:13.183
(crickets chirping)

17:21.074 --> 17:22.406
- Jesus, Julius.

17:25.693 --> 17:27.550
Did you wait for me?

17:27.550 --> 17:28.843
- As I always do.

17:30.695 --> 17:33.145
- It's getting hard to
cover for you, down there.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.300
Everyone's asking questions.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.325
- Yeah?

17:37.325 --> 17:38.360
Like who?

17:38.360 --> 17:40.237
- [Phil] Like everyone.

17:40.237 --> 17:42.160
- [Julius] You're the manager,

17:42.160 --> 17:44.373
you make those decisions, correct?

17:46.028 --> 17:48.670
- I, I make decisions,

17:48.670 --> 17:50.270
but I don't make every decision.

17:52.374 --> 17:54.523
- You know, I shoulda had your job.

17:56.350 --> 17:58.400
- Somehow I knew this was gonna come up.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.820
- I fought 10 years, 10
years to get that job,

18:01.820 --> 18:04.495
and baby dick walks in and takes it.

18:04.495 --> 18:05.400
- [Phil] Give him a cocktail.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.830
- You went and you walked
your little frat boy ass

18:07.830 --> 18:08.870
into that office,

18:08.870 --> 18:12.446
and walked out with the
title, bank manager.

18:12.446 --> 18:14.440
- Bank manager.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.290
- It's all right.

18:16.420 --> 18:17.563
You're a good kid.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.233
Yep.

18:21.147 --> 18:23.243
You're like the son I never had.

18:24.450 --> 18:27.266
- I guess you're the
50-year-old grandpa I never had.

18:27.266 --> 18:30.560
(Julius laughing)

18:30.560 --> 18:31.860
- You gonna go there, huh?

18:32.911 --> 18:34.670
(sighs)

18:34.670 --> 18:36.263
- Where were you today?

18:42.124 --> 18:42.957
Julius.

18:44.713 --> 18:45.720
I don't think you're gonna find

18:45.720 --> 18:48.630
what you're looking for
at the cemetery, man.

18:48.630 --> 18:52.150
I think that's the last place
you're gonna find answers.

18:52.150 --> 18:54.350
- You know what I been
thinking about, Phil?

18:57.244 --> 18:58.733
When I was a kid,

19:01.070 --> 19:03.350
my buddies and I, we'd shoot basketball,

19:03.350 --> 19:06.743
down at the old Recreation
Center on 5th and Robinson.

19:08.930 --> 19:13.123
That summer, I met a girl, Rebecca.

19:15.180 --> 19:16.533
They'd just moved here.

19:18.010 --> 19:19.060
She didn't talk much.

19:20.251 --> 19:22.160
(chuckles) I don't know, one day,

19:22.160 --> 19:25.040
she decided to come up, and say hello.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.600
She walked right up onto the court

19:26.600 --> 19:28.810
and she told me that she would kick my ass

19:28.810 --> 19:30.280
in basketball, any day.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.680
- No?
- Yeah!

19:31.680 --> 19:33.040
And walked right out the door.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.110
- I bet she did.

19:34.110 --> 19:35.573
- She waited for me outside.

19:37.390 --> 19:41.763
I wasn't mad, I couldn't
get her out of my head.

19:44.820 --> 19:49.820
She was beautiful,
innocent, and those eyes...

19:54.190 --> 19:58.690
We were together for months,
kissed once or twice,

19:58.690 --> 20:01.220
but it wasn't about that.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.433
We, we were like soulmates.

20:08.650 --> 20:13.327
One night I was upstairs,
looking through my car magazines.

20:14.750 --> 20:16.613
Saw the light outside my bedroom.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.110
I watched through the window for hours,

20:22.060 --> 20:23.230
'til the sun came up,

20:24.305 --> 20:26.222
'til all the cars left.

20:27.577 --> 20:32.153
Her mother and father cried
for hours on their front porch.

20:35.410 --> 20:37.463
Someone killed their daughter.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.820
It's happening to me now.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.281
Why Phil?

20:43.390 --> 20:44.973
Why would God do this to me?

20:46.526 --> 20:47.835
- I don't know.

20:47.835 --> 20:51.002
(slow dramatic music)

20:54.430 --> 20:56.653
- My momma didn't want
me to go to the funeral.

20:58.202 --> 21:00.423
(sighs) She said it would
stay with me forever.

21:03.099 --> 21:05.107
That sadness never goes away.

21:06.878 --> 21:10.070
- They're gonna find your daughter.

21:10.070 --> 21:10.903
They will.

21:12.654 --> 21:15.654
Then you can put all this behind us.

21:22.972 --> 21:25.471
Hey, what do you say we get started, huh?

21:25.471 --> 21:28.221
(fire crackling)

21:36.946 --> 21:39.779
(sad piano music)

21:48.020 --> 21:51.103
(photograph ripping)

22:09.018 --> 22:12.768
(soft, dramatic cello music)

22:15.035 --> 22:17.993
(Stan groaning)

22:17.993 --> 22:21.401
(chains jangling)

22:21.401 --> 22:24.358
(Stan groaning)

22:24.358 --> 22:26.090
(chain thudding)

22:26.090 --> 22:27.399
(Stan sobbing)

22:27.399 --> 22:30.566
(light switch clicks)

22:39.920 --> 22:41.707
- I'm begging you, Stan.

22:41.707 --> 22:43.640
I'm begging you.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.473
Please.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.910
Just tell me where she is.

22:47.910 --> 22:48.743
- [Stan] Please.

22:52.510 --> 22:54.690
- I don't get it, I just don't get it.

22:54.690 --> 22:55.530
Why?

22:55.530 --> 22:59.163
Why would you let this drag
on for so goddamn long?

23:07.520 --> 23:10.163
It's killing me inside to do this to you.

23:11.439 --> 23:14.193
I thought you were a
good kid, an honest kid.

23:15.861 --> 23:19.610
I let you come over, made you sandwiches,

23:19.610 --> 23:20.773
let you watch movies,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.280
saw you put your greasy fucking arm

23:24.280 --> 23:26.980
around my daughter's shoulders
and didn't say a thing.

23:28.103 --> 23:29.443
Now, do me the courtesy,

23:30.610 --> 23:33.643
and tell me where my daughter is.

23:34.590 --> 23:36.179
- [Stan] I don't know.

23:36.179 --> 23:38.837
I don't know, I don't know.

23:38.837 --> 23:42.160
(kick thwacking)
(Stan groaning)

23:42.160 --> 23:43.494
- Don't touch me, Phil!

23:43.494 --> 23:44.919
- You're gonna kill the kid.

23:44.919 --> 23:46.646
- [Julius] If he dies, then he dies.

23:46.646 --> 23:50.792
- If he dies, you don't get
the answers you wanna hear.

23:50.792 --> 23:53.191
Yeah, think about that.

23:53.191 --> 23:54.024
- Okay.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.187
- [Stan] No.

24:02.467 --> 24:04.363
- You gotta understand, kid.

24:05.210 --> 24:06.360
I'm Annabelle's father.

24:08.350 --> 24:09.823
My Belle is all I have.

24:10.951 --> 24:12.773
My Belle is my life.

24:13.972 --> 24:16.330
I will not let this go.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.780
I refuse to let my baby die this way.

24:18.780 --> 24:21.947
(light switch clicks)

24:24.468 --> 24:28.218
(mallet and door clattering)

24:46.381 --> 24:47.964
- Well, well, well.

24:48.890 --> 24:50.453
What have we here, huh?

24:53.200 --> 24:54.413
I know you was fired.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.350
Mm-hmm.

24:57.350 --> 24:58.713
I called for you last week.

25:00.380 --> 25:02.180
I called and someone else picked up.

25:03.820 --> 25:06.873
Young kid, barely a man,

25:08.584 --> 25:11.330
said he didn't know what
I was talking about.

25:11.330 --> 25:13.690
Said he was the replacement

25:13.690 --> 25:16.346
for the guy that never came back.

25:16.346 --> 25:17.780
(laughs)

25:17.780 --> 25:18.750
The guy that never came back,

25:18.750 --> 25:20.320
well, you know, that makes perfect sense,

25:20.320 --> 25:23.264
since you ain't brought home no paycheck.

25:23.264 --> 25:24.097
- Shut up.

25:25.301 --> 25:27.509
- [Marcia] They had to
let you go didn't they?

25:27.509 --> 25:30.020
Can't blame 'em.
- [Stan] Please.

25:30.020 --> 25:32.003
- Look what our lives have become, huh?

25:33.400 --> 25:34.533
You don't give a shit.

25:35.380 --> 25:37.530
You don't give a shit about us.

25:37.530 --> 25:39.980
You don't give a shit about me.

25:39.980 --> 25:42.090
- Shut up.

25:42.090 --> 25:44.180
- They took the car, you know.

25:44.180 --> 25:46.000
They're gonna take the house.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.780
And then what, huh?

25:47.780 --> 25:49.440
Then what, Julius?

25:49.440 --> 25:51.130
You gonna let some man come on in here

25:51.130 --> 25:52.580
and take a little bit of me too,

25:52.580 --> 25:54.010
huh, is that what you're gonna do?

25:54.010 --> 25:55.540
That's what you're gonna let happen, huh?

25:55.540 --> 25:57.073
- Shut your goddamn mouth.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.890
Not another word outta you, or so help me,

26:00.890 --> 26:03.850
I will shove my fist down
your throat, and out your ass,

26:03.850 --> 26:06.403
and strangle you with my shitty hands.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.410
(mallet thuds)

26:09.410 --> 26:14.410
- You have become a disgusting,
despicable, drunk fool.

26:19.970 --> 26:22.700
I have no use for you.

26:22.700 --> 26:23.853
I hope you drop dead.

26:25.731 --> 26:29.980
- You were always
disgusting and despicable.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.913
I hope you drop dead.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.373
I hope you drop dead, right now.

26:38.270 --> 26:40.670
I'm planning on setting the house on fire.

26:40.670 --> 26:41.653
I don't care.

26:43.197 --> 26:44.030
All right.

26:44.892 --> 26:46.590
(Stan panting)

26:46.590 --> 26:48.950
Wait a week to do the laundry,

26:48.950 --> 26:50.023
that's what you do.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.720
It all piles up.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.903
Take it there.

26:55.466 --> 26:56.299
And that.

26:59.475 --> 27:01.442
(door clatters)

27:01.442 --> 27:04.017
(Julius murmuring)

27:04.017 --> 27:06.204
(door slams)

27:06.204 --> 27:09.204
Why can't this bitch leave me alone?

27:10.450 --> 27:12.097
No wonder she left.

27:14.479 --> 27:17.129
(object thuds)
(Stan whimpers)

27:17.129 --> 27:18.970
It's because of you.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.373
You!

27:20.373 --> 27:22.430
This is your fault.

27:22.430 --> 27:25.020
You turned my life upside down.

27:25.020 --> 27:27.943
You ripped my soul, my family apart.

27:28.810 --> 27:31.007
I will make you pay.

27:31.007 --> 27:35.260
You won't give me answers, I
won't give you your life back.

27:35.260 --> 27:36.350
Simple as that.

27:38.023 --> 27:40.773
(dramatic music)

27:42.321 --> 27:44.210
(Stan groaning)

27:44.210 --> 27:45.043
Open up.

27:46.526 --> 27:47.623
Take it, boy.

27:49.623 --> 27:53.620
(Julius laughing)
(Stan spluttering)

27:53.620 --> 27:55.703
You getting what you deserve, boy.

27:57.738 --> 27:59.012
(Julius laughing)

27:59.012 --> 28:01.054
(chains jangling)

28:01.054 --> 28:02.721
That's what you get.

28:09.410 --> 28:11.303
Maybe I'll read you a bedtime story.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.020
(hand thuds)

28:20.750 --> 28:23.250
(chair thuds)

28:27.570 --> 28:32.087
Tonight, I'll be back to visit you.

28:33.257 --> 28:35.124
How do you like that?

28:35.124 --> 28:35.957
Huh?

28:36.979 --> 28:40.140
Come on, answer me or something, huh?

28:40.140 --> 28:41.140
- [Stan] No.

28:43.079 --> 28:46.159
- Here's what I'm gonna do, about that.

28:46.159 --> 28:49.742
Make you something
really nice and special.

28:50.789 --> 28:52.145
You know what I'm gonna do?

28:52.145 --> 28:55.440
Maybe I'm gonna take a
shit, I'm gonna cut that up,

28:56.955 --> 28:59.250
and serve it to you on a cracker.

29:00.580 --> 29:03.163
Hmm, what do you think of that?

29:06.153 --> 29:06.986
- Hmm?
- [Stan] No.

29:06.986 --> 29:11.403
- You brought this upon
yourself, remember that.

29:20.580 --> 29:23.593
Eventually, Stan, you're gonna talk.

29:23.593 --> 29:25.625
(dramatic music)

29:25.625 --> 29:26.458
Okay.

29:48.243 --> 29:50.670
- Oh, hell, no.

29:50.670 --> 29:54.660
Oh my God, Julius, you stink.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.360
No, no, you know what,
you know the rules, okay?

29:57.360 --> 29:59.290
Now go take a shower
if you finished playing

29:59.290 --> 30:00.280
with your pet in the basement.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.880
Go on, go on, get outta here.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.833
You ain't coming into
bed with me like that.

30:05.833 --> 30:07.393
God, you smell.

30:08.610 --> 30:09.913
God, disgusting.

30:11.750 --> 30:12.773
Asshole.

30:13.750 --> 30:14.850
What's wrong with you?

30:17.173 --> 30:18.673
Go take a shower or something.

30:30.922 --> 30:33.922
(Annabelle sobbing)

30:35.594 --> 30:37.132
- No, no.

30:37.132 --> 30:38.933
Don't you love me, Daddy?

30:40.060 --> 30:43.277
Why won't you help me, Daddy? (sobbing)

30:46.072 --> 30:48.822
(Julius humming)

30:58.262 --> 30:59.825
- (chuckling) What?

30:59.825 --> 31:00.973
What do you want?

31:02.241 --> 31:04.688
- What you gonna do about him?

31:04.688 --> 31:05.521
- Who?

31:05.521 --> 31:08.340
- What do you mean, who, asshole?

31:08.340 --> 31:11.013
That piece of shit in the basement.

31:11.013 --> 31:12.980
You know, the one that you
kick the shit of, every day,

31:12.980 --> 31:15.380
before you climb your sorry, dirty ass

31:15.380 --> 31:16.763
into bed with me at night.

31:17.830 --> 31:19.090
- Don't you worry about that,

31:19.090 --> 31:21.011
that has nothing to do with you.

31:21.011 --> 31:21.923
(Marcia sighs)

31:21.923 --> 31:23.124
- Nothing to do with me, huh?

31:23.124 --> 31:23.957
- No.

31:25.480 --> 31:30.160
- You leave me here with
him, every single day.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.920
He could get loose, he could break free.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.580
You know, he could kill me.

31:34.580 --> 31:36.280
He could easily kill me.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.243
That's what I have to worry about.

31:40.687 --> 31:42.247
- I'm gonna take care of him.

31:44.424 --> 31:47.424
(suspenseful music)

31:52.892 --> 31:55.559
(door clicking)

32:00.330 --> 32:01.760
Yeah.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.593
But I need you.

32:03.660 --> 32:04.493
Just come.

32:12.428 --> 32:15.595
(light switch clicks)

32:17.378 --> 32:20.128
(plate clatters)

32:21.626 --> 32:22.459
Eat.

32:28.108 --> 32:29.191
Eat the shit.

32:34.402 --> 32:36.502
You're gonna need your energy for tonight.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.563
I don't plan to go easy on you.

32:45.670 --> 32:50.610
Soon, very soon, Stan, I'm gonna kill you.

32:57.374 --> 33:00.041
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

33:05.936 --> 33:10.019
(soft dramatic orchestral music)

33:31.327 --> 33:33.994
(door clicking)

33:38.481 --> 33:41.556
(gentle piano music)

33:41.556 --> 33:43.420
(Stan scrabbling)

33:43.420 --> 33:48.420
(Stan grunting)
(chain jangling)

33:53.517 --> 33:58.236
(Stan chewing)
(Stan breathing heavily)

33:58.236 --> 34:00.236
- [Stan] Son of a bitch.

34:05.230 --> 34:07.023
- What, you going to work today?

34:08.210 --> 34:11.210
You know, we can't keep
living on what we got left.

34:11.210 --> 34:12.043
All right?

34:12.043 --> 34:15.760
We are scraping the barrel here, Julius.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.780
You know, I can't go nowhere,

34:17.780 --> 34:19.949
I can't do nothing.

34:19.949 --> 34:21.380
I gotta stay here all day long

34:21.380 --> 34:25.230
and make sure your little
science experiment don't run off.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.110
What kind of life is that for me, huh?

34:27.110 --> 34:28.699
What kind of freedom do I get, huh?

34:28.699 --> 34:29.650
- Marcia, please.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.120
- [Marcia] No, no, no,
this is not a good think.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.679
- For you, it's not a good thing,

34:33.679 --> 34:36.530
but for me it's justice.

34:36.530 --> 34:39.030
I'm doing what's right for
this family, my family.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.330
The hell with the law.

34:41.330 --> 34:42.900
They can't do what they're supposed to do,

34:42.900 --> 34:44.969
I will do it myself.

34:44.969 --> 34:46.940
You have to understand.

34:46.940 --> 34:48.310
They have to understand.

34:48.310 --> 34:50.993
You fuck with my family,
I will make them pay.

34:53.580 --> 34:54.413
I'm sorry.

34:55.530 --> 34:57.483
- How long is this gonna go on?

34:58.459 --> 35:01.208
- As long as it takes, baby.

35:01.208 --> 35:02.875
As long as it takes.

35:07.665 --> 35:10.748
- (sighs) Oh, Jesus.

35:14.935 --> 35:18.268
- Baltimore, San Francisco, who won?

35:18.268 --> 35:19.768
- Didn't watch it.

35:21.445 --> 35:23.278
- You didn't watch it?

35:24.126 --> 35:26.126
That's your team, buddy.

35:31.470 --> 35:33.070
What's the plan for today, boss?

35:38.220 --> 35:40.010
We're gonna have to talk about him.

35:40.010 --> 35:41.374
- [Julius] Who?

35:41.374 --> 35:42.860
- [Phil] The kid.

35:42.860 --> 35:45.060
- You've been talking
to Marcia. (chuckles)

35:45.060 --> 35:46.680
- [Phil] No. Why?

35:46.680 --> 35:48.180
- She asked me the same thing.

35:49.090 --> 35:50.839
I'll take care of it.

35:50.839 --> 35:52.139
- How?

35:52.139 --> 35:53.830
- I'm trying to figure it out.

35:53.830 --> 35:55.223
It's not an easy process.

35:57.140 --> 35:58.590
- You've only got one option.

35:59.890 --> 36:01.150
You can't let him go.

36:01.150 --> 36:03.123
- I never killed a man.

36:03.123 --> 36:04.873
I don't think I can.

36:07.898 --> 36:10.063
How the hell did it get to this?

36:12.070 --> 36:13.053
My life was good.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.063
Not incredible, but good.

36:16.970 --> 36:18.613
Not great, but good.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.720
She was going to school.

36:23.030 --> 36:24.443
She could have been a doctor,

36:26.008 --> 36:28.283
(sighs) maybe a lawyer or a teacher.

36:29.450 --> 36:31.050
Shit, she coulda been something.

36:32.586 --> 36:35.917
(sighs) It's not fair,
not to me, not to her.

36:37.030 --> 36:39.453
It wasn't supposed to happen to us.

36:39.453 --> 36:41.323
- Who was it supposed to happen to, then?

36:42.610 --> 36:45.633
Can't you see this is
all bullshit, Julius?

36:47.120 --> 36:48.533
You have to kill the kid.

36:49.630 --> 36:51.800
Get rid of him, kill him,

36:51.800 --> 36:54.313
do whatever you have
to do to end this shit,

36:55.174 --> 36:57.565
or we all suffer the consequences.

36:57.565 --> 37:00.232
(bird chirping)

37:08.390 --> 37:09.830
- My lady.

37:09.830 --> 37:11.530
- Oh, Antonio, thank you for the coffee.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.554
That was so thoughtful of you.

37:13.554 --> 37:15.450
- You're welcome.

37:15.450 --> 37:17.500
Oh, what a beautiful day.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.541
- I know. (chuckling)

37:19.541 --> 37:21.130
- You know, there was a
man in the coffee shop

37:21.130 --> 37:24.220
and he was just angry at the world.

37:24.220 --> 37:25.053
- You don't say.

37:25.053 --> 37:28.510
- He was mean, ignorant, downright nasty.

37:28.510 --> 37:29.343
- No way.

37:29.343 --> 37:32.046
- In my country, that would be a joke.

37:32.046 --> 37:34.760
Life is about passion,

37:34.760 --> 37:38.133
embracing the inner love and
sharing it with the world.

37:38.970 --> 37:40.411
- Oh, I know.

37:40.411 --> 37:41.463
I know.

37:42.770 --> 37:44.700
- Look at your eyes.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.170
Your eyes are like the
Eiffel Towers and spring.

37:47.170 --> 37:48.593
I just wanna bathe in them.

37:49.894 --> 37:52.394
My darling, I hate to ask you.

37:54.357 --> 37:57.567
By any chance, did you bring the money?

37:59.900 --> 38:00.733
- Yeah.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.170
This should be the last of it, correct?

38:05.170 --> 38:08.193
- In a perfect world, it
would be, but I will make do.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.660
Oh Lord have mercy, look at the time.

38:11.660 --> 38:14.870
My darling, I have a very
important meeting and I must fly.

38:14.870 --> 38:18.610
You know, I seek fast-paced intensity.

38:18.610 --> 38:21.268
Action, action, action.

38:21.268 --> 38:22.960
- When am I gonna see you again, though?

38:22.960 --> 38:25.313
- Soon, in time.

38:28.150 --> 38:28.983
- You want action?

38:28.983 --> 38:31.322
Well, I could show you action.

38:31.322 --> 38:32.155
- Oh my darling.

38:32.155 --> 38:33.013
- Well...

38:33.013 --> 38:34.223
- Please, not in front of the flag.

38:34.223 --> 38:36.503
- Not that kind of action.

38:39.040 --> 38:43.333
It's a secret, and it's
something that nobody can know.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.477
- Show we now?

38:50.551 --> 38:51.384
- Soon.

38:53.230 --> 38:54.063
In time.

38:56.692 --> 38:57.859
I'll call you.

38:59.983 --> 39:02.066
Thank you for the coffee.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.047
I'll call you.

39:11.997 --> 39:14.497
(Stan sobbing)

39:14.497 --> 39:17.777
- I didn't do anything. (sobs)

39:17.777 --> 39:18.610
Help!

39:20.827 --> 39:21.660
Please.

39:22.798 --> 39:23.948
(sobs) Please, help me.

39:26.682 --> 39:28.253
- I had a great night.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.483
- That's it, just great?

39:33.370 --> 39:34.203
- Perfect.

39:37.664 --> 39:39.220
- Okay.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.160
I know with you going
out East for college,

39:41.160 --> 39:43.543
and I'm due at university.

39:47.381 --> 39:49.273
I wanna find a way to make this work.

39:51.370 --> 39:54.000
I've never been with somebody this long.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.163
Never felt like this, never.

39:59.710 --> 40:01.173
- I feel the same way.

40:02.260 --> 40:03.823
I never met a boy like you.

40:15.650 --> 40:18.540
- I just wanna tell you that...

40:18.540 --> 40:19.393
- What?

40:19.393 --> 40:20.593
Tell me what?

40:22.897 --> 40:25.314
(Stan sighs)

40:27.260 --> 40:30.233
Stanley Peters, do you love me?

40:32.980 --> 40:33.813
- I do.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.173
- How much?

40:37.980 --> 40:40.660
- Enough to wrap this planet 10 times.

40:40.660 --> 40:41.890
- Is that it?

40:41.890 --> 40:42.833
- Just about.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.153
And do you love me?

40:46.001 --> 40:48.334
- What a silly thing to ask.

40:54.948 --> 40:56.476
Oh Stan!

40:56.476 --> 40:58.059
Stan, what is that?

41:02.259 --> 41:05.568
(gentle, hopeful music)

41:05.568 --> 41:06.985
I do, I love you.

41:32.786 --> 41:36.036
(knocking on car door)

41:37.400 --> 41:39.180
- Well, well, well.

41:39.180 --> 41:40.972
What have we here, huh?

41:40.972 --> 41:44.563
What are you kids having
like a little sexual picnic?

41:46.130 --> 41:47.940
Annabelle, get yourself
out of the car now.

41:47.940 --> 41:48.773
Get out.

41:50.243 --> 41:53.650
Get out and go upstairs, and
stop acting like a whore.

41:54.910 --> 41:58.130
And you, Mr. Stanley, well,

41:58.130 --> 42:00.890
you may wanna take a
little bit of advice, okay?

42:00.890 --> 42:02.850
You may wanna sow your wild oats

42:02.850 --> 42:04.750
with somebody else's daughter

42:04.750 --> 42:07.373
'cause you ain't gonna do it with mine.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.000
Now you keep your hands to yourself

42:11.000 --> 42:12.830
before you end up not having any hands.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.920
You understand me, boy?

42:14.920 --> 42:16.460
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
- Yes, ma'am.

42:16.460 --> 42:17.501
- I said I can't hear you.

42:17.501 --> 42:18.477
- Yes, ma'am, I understand you.

42:18.477 --> 42:20.177
- That's a little bit better, now.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.930
Now you get yourself outta here.

42:23.830 --> 42:24.823
Drive safe though.

42:25.750 --> 42:27.230
Have a good night.

42:27.230 --> 42:28.063
- Thank you.

42:29.610 --> 42:32.610
(car door slamming)

42:33.858 --> 42:35.525
Oh, shit, oh my God.

42:38.875 --> 42:40.375
Oh, what did I do.

42:41.342 --> 42:42.649
What did I do.

42:42.649 --> 42:44.121
Stupid, stupid.

42:44.121 --> 42:47.483
(Stan sobbing)

42:47.483 --> 42:50.421
I didn't do anything. (sobbing)

42:50.421 --> 42:51.254
Help!

42:55.324 --> 42:58.491
(soft dramatic music)

43:14.720 --> 43:17.130
- Hey, Antonio, hi.

43:17.130 --> 43:18.083
It's Marcia.

43:19.468 --> 43:23.593
Julius just left so I'm
at the house by myself.

43:25.207 --> 43:27.157
I was wondering if you wanna come over.

43:28.567 --> 43:31.683
Remember that thing I was
telling you about in the park?

43:33.360 --> 43:36.740
Yeah, well, I was
wondering if you wanna see

43:36.740 --> 43:39.063
what I was talking about.

43:41.700 --> 43:43.687
Yeah, no, I'm here, I'm here.

43:44.600 --> 43:46.453
Okay, great, I'll wait for you.

43:47.330 --> 43:50.044
All right, (laughs) I
can't wait to see you.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.700
(knocking on door)

43:51.700 --> 43:52.533
Okay, bye.

43:53.450 --> 43:56.241
Julius, what the hell did you forget now?

43:56.241 --> 43:59.300
(knocking on door)

43:59.300 --> 44:00.133
- Marcia.

44:01.477 --> 44:02.323
- Joel.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.200
- I hope I'm not outta place, but, I,

44:05.200 --> 44:08.893
look, I sincerely, I
apologize for the intrusion.

44:11.841 --> 44:13.830
Have you heard anything?

44:13.830 --> 44:15.200
- What?

44:15.200 --> 44:16.670
About your boy?

44:16.670 --> 44:19.090
- Yeah, it's been weeks.

44:19.090 --> 44:21.390
The police must have
said something, anything.

44:22.640 --> 44:26.513
Look, my wife and I are going crazy.

44:27.414 --> 44:29.033
I'm sure you can understand.

44:30.927 --> 44:32.995
One parent to another,

44:32.995 --> 44:34.963
it's a lot of sleepless nights.

44:36.130 --> 44:38.183
- We ain't heard nothing.

44:38.183 --> 44:42.913
Hell, all I know is,
maybe your boy, my girl,

44:43.780 --> 44:46.000
maybe off in some hick town in Georgia.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.700
You know, maybe they're drinking,

44:47.700 --> 44:48.533
maybe they're drugging.

44:48.533 --> 44:50.290
Maybe he's making her have sex

44:50.290 --> 44:53.180
'cause, you know, he is a
disrespectful piece of shit.

44:53.180 --> 44:55.700
- Oh, you don't have to
talk that way about my boy.

44:55.700 --> 44:57.860
- Best be on your way, Joel, hmm?

44:57.860 --> 45:02.380
- Look, I'm sorry for the
interruption, but damn, woman!

45:02.380 --> 45:03.900
Come on!

45:03.900 --> 45:08.900
- First of all, Joel, don't
you ever yell in my house.

45:11.630 --> 45:15.373
And secondly, like I said before,

45:16.509 --> 45:20.853
I think you best be on your way.

45:22.722 --> 45:25.389
(door slamming)

45:26.427 --> 45:29.344
(knocking on door)

45:35.153 --> 45:35.986
- Hey.

45:35.986 --> 45:36.819
- Hey, hi.

45:36.819 --> 45:37.652
- Are you okay?

45:37.652 --> 45:38.485
- Oh, I'm fine.

45:38.485 --> 45:39.320
- I came right over.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.520
- Oh, thank you for coming.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.713
No, I'm fine, really.

45:44.854 --> 45:46.570
- Can I come in?

45:46.570 --> 45:48.110
- Oh (laughs) my goodness.

45:48.110 --> 45:49.040
Please excuse my rudeness.

45:49.040 --> 45:50.510
Absolutely, please, come on in.

45:50.510 --> 45:52.893
- And I take it that
your husband is not here,

45:54.027 --> 45:54.860
is that correct?

45:55.780 --> 45:56.613
- Correct.

45:56.613 --> 45:59.761
In fact, he won't be back
for quite some time. (laughs)

45:59.761 --> 46:00.761
- All right.

46:01.849 --> 46:04.549
You said that you had something
you wanted to show me?

46:05.980 --> 46:06.813
- Yeah.

46:07.937 --> 46:10.473
But you can't tell nobody.

46:10.473 --> 46:11.374
- All right.

46:11.374 --> 46:12.620
- You can't tell nobody.

46:12.620 --> 46:13.453
- Okay.

46:13.453 --> 46:14.286
- Okay.

46:20.695 --> 46:22.573
You can't say a word.

46:22.573 --> 46:24.264
- All right.

46:24.264 --> 46:27.431
(soft dramatic music)

46:30.721 --> 46:31.683
Shit.

46:35.724 --> 46:37.144
Shit.

46:37.144 --> 46:38.465
Oh my God!

46:38.465 --> 46:39.660
This is crazy.

46:39.660 --> 46:41.309
That is some crazy shit.

46:41.309 --> 46:42.450
- This is, you wanted action, right?

46:42.450 --> 46:43.283
- No.

46:43.283 --> 46:45.950
No, no, not this, I
wasn't talking about this.

46:45.950 --> 46:47.100
- Did, you said this what you want,

46:47.100 --> 46:48.600
you love this kind of shit.

46:48.600 --> 46:49.810
I mean you made a whole
production about it,

46:49.810 --> 46:50.643
out in the park.

46:50.643 --> 46:52.370
You wanted action, you wanted adventure.

46:52.370 --> 46:53.290
- I was not talking about this.

46:53.290 --> 46:55.150
I was talking about travel, sex,

46:55.150 --> 46:57.910
a blowjob, maybe, with a little teeth.

46:57.910 --> 46:59.300
- Well then, maybe

46:59.300 --> 47:01.270
you should have been a
little bit more clear.

47:01.270 --> 47:02.985
- But tell me something, Marcia.

47:02.985 --> 47:04.350
What are you doing in there?

47:04.350 --> 47:06.430
Are, you kidnapped that
kid to harvest organs?

47:06.430 --> 47:08.210
Is that what you're into?

47:08.210 --> 47:09.290
I gotta get the hell outta here.

47:09.290 --> 47:10.570
- Oh, hell no, you can't go.

47:10.570 --> 47:13.220
You can't tell a soul about
this, okay, you can't go.

47:14.186 --> 47:15.210
- Listen.

47:15.210 --> 47:17.083
Just, just level with me, all right?

47:18.352 --> 47:20.830
Are you kidnapping people,
trying to impress me?

47:22.907 --> 47:26.410
- You know, sometimes, sometimes,

47:26.410 --> 47:30.290
people just do some crazy
shit, baby, crazy shit.

47:30.290 --> 47:31.824
(kissing)

47:31.824 --> 47:34.180
- Get off me, you crazy bitch.

47:34.180 --> 47:35.450
- You can't tell a soul.

47:35.450 --> 47:36.887
You can't tell nobody about this.

47:36.887 --> 47:40.034
- All right. 10,000.

47:40.034 --> 47:40.867
- What?

47:40.867 --> 47:43.523
- 10,000. I'm gonna need 10,000.

47:43.523 --> 47:44.356
- Have you lost your mind?

47:44.356 --> 47:45.800
Are you crazy or what?

47:45.800 --> 47:47.370
- Well, you're right, I
think I am a little crazy.

47:47.370 --> 47:49.620
I think, I think I underbid myself.

47:49.620 --> 47:51.290
20,000.

47:51.290 --> 47:54.120
20,000 cash to keep my mouth shut.

47:54.120 --> 47:56.830
I'm gonna need 20,000.

47:56.830 --> 47:59.293
- Oh, goddamn you, I
should have known better.

48:00.317 --> 48:01.150
Fine.

48:01.150 --> 48:02.030
- Fine.

48:02.030 --> 48:04.460
- Fine, I will get you your 20,000

48:04.460 --> 48:06.720
or whatever it is you want,

48:06.720 --> 48:10.487
and in the meantime you
can take your sorry ass

48:10.487 --> 48:13.160
and get the hell out of my house.

48:13.160 --> 48:13.993
- Fine.

48:13.993 --> 48:15.995
- Go, get outta my house now.

48:15.995 --> 48:16.828
- Fine.

48:16.828 --> 48:17.661
- Fine.

48:17.661 --> 48:18.760
- 5,000 cash-

48:18.760 --> 48:20.710
- Whatever, go, just get out of my house.

48:20.710 --> 48:21.543
- All right.

48:21.543 --> 48:22.376
- Get out.

48:22.376 --> 48:23.524
- After you.

48:23.524 --> 48:25.130
- Asshole.

48:25.130 --> 48:26.560
- Asshole?

48:26.560 --> 48:29.533
You're the one got a
man chained to the wall.

48:29.533 --> 48:31.090
- I don't believe you.

48:31.090 --> 48:34.243
You have some pair of
balls, you really do.

48:34.243 --> 48:36.757
I am so aggravated to leave you.

48:39.688 --> 48:40.521
- Hi.

48:42.403 --> 48:43.827
- Who the fuck are you?

48:43.827 --> 48:45.740
- I'm a, I'm a friend.

48:45.740 --> 48:47.305
- Speak your face.

48:47.305 --> 48:48.710
- I'm a friend.

48:48.710 --> 48:50.280
- Marcia, who is this man,

48:50.280 --> 48:53.260
and why is he in this house, my house?

48:53.260 --> 48:54.420
- I'm a friend.

48:54.420 --> 48:55.402
I'm a friend.

48:55.402 --> 48:57.780
- A friend of who, my wife?

48:57.780 --> 48:59.330
Does he know?

48:59.330 --> 49:00.459
- Know what?

49:00.459 --> 49:01.950
- I don't know anything.

49:01.950 --> 49:03.060
Nothing.

49:03.060 --> 49:04.280
- I knew she was gonna mess this up.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.660
- What do you wanna do?

49:05.660 --> 49:06.560
- Nothing.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.290
You leave him alone.

49:08.290 --> 49:10.090
Don't you touch him.

49:10.090 --> 49:10.923
- How long?

49:10.923 --> 49:12.908
How long have you been
sleeping with this man, Marcia?

49:12.908 --> 49:14.870
- Wait a second, I have
not slept with this woman.

49:14.870 --> 49:17.870
- Oh, well, not yet, anyway.

49:17.870 --> 49:19.640
- You lousy bitch.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.580
You bring a man into my house,

49:21.580 --> 49:23.570
you show him the
situation in our basement,

49:23.570 --> 49:26.290
and you tell me that nothing's going on?

49:26.290 --> 49:28.520
How stupid do you think I am?

49:28.520 --> 49:29.849
He's gonna go to the cops.

49:29.849 --> 49:31.006
- No he's not.
- Yes.

49:31.006 --> 49:32.364
- No, Julius.
- He's gonna rat us out.

49:32.364 --> 49:34.747
- No he will not.
- You and I are going to jail.

49:34.747 --> 49:35.580
- No, you're wrong.

49:35.580 --> 49:36.830
- You hear me?

49:36.830 --> 49:39.670
Tell me, how could you be so careless?

49:39.670 --> 49:41.310
- Julius, just take it easy, okay.

49:41.310 --> 49:43.050
- What a shitfest this is.

49:43.050 --> 49:45.230
- He ain't gonna say a word.

49:45.230 --> 49:46.400
- How do you figure that?

49:46.400 --> 49:47.750
- You shut up.

49:47.750 --> 49:50.019
- We made a deal.

49:50.019 --> 49:50.852
- A deal?

49:50.852 --> 49:51.735
- Yes.
- What kind of a deal?

49:51.735 --> 49:52.950
- I'm gonna pay him a little bit of money,

49:52.950 --> 49:54.140
help fund his venture.

49:54.140 --> 49:55.110
- [Julius] How much is a little bit?

49:55.110 --> 49:55.990
- 30,000

49:55.990 --> 49:57.560
- [Marcia] We agreed on 20.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.800
- And how, better yet, where
are we gonna get this money?

50:01.800 --> 50:02.633
- I don't know, Julius,

50:02.633 --> 50:04.676
maybe I wanna sell a couple of things.

50:04.676 --> 50:08.769
- I'm gonna kill him
and bury you up his ass.

50:08.769 --> 50:10.206
- You're nasty.

50:10.206 --> 50:12.080
(doorbell rings)

50:12.080 --> 50:14.290
- How many goddamn boyfriends do you have?

50:14.290 --> 50:15.490
- You want me to get the doorbell?

50:15.490 --> 50:16.593
- You shut up.

50:17.770 --> 50:21.647
- Look, before the shit gets
any crazier, do we have a deal?

50:21.647 --> 50:22.480
- No.
- Yes.

50:23.930 --> 50:24.830
- Fine.

50:24.830 --> 50:25.663
Deal.

50:25.663 --> 50:26.960
- 40 grand

50:26.960 --> 50:28.170
- You son of a bitch.

50:28.170 --> 50:29.209
- Take it easy.

50:29.209 --> 50:30.580
(doorbell rings)

50:30.580 --> 50:34.231
- Okay, just shut your
mouth and let me talk.

50:34.231 --> 50:36.090
(doorbell rings)

50:36.090 --> 50:38.090
Phil, go down to the basement

50:38.090 --> 50:40.040
and make sure that the kid keeps quiet.

50:44.711 --> 50:47.128
(door slams)

50:52.720 --> 50:54.086
Officer Mcglone.

50:54.086 --> 50:54.919
- Good afternoon.

50:54.919 --> 50:56.107
Can I come in?

50:56.107 --> 50:59.524
- We were kind of in a family discussion.

51:03.044 --> 51:04.740
- Good afternoon.

51:04.740 --> 51:06.964
- Of course, you know Marcia.

51:06.964 --> 51:08.980
- John.
- And this is...

51:10.370 --> 51:11.600
- Antonio.

51:11.600 --> 51:15.420
- Yeah, Antonio, her gay friend.

51:15.420 --> 51:18.373
At least, I think he's gay. (laughs)

51:19.740 --> 51:22.083
- I've told him a hundred
times, I'm not gay.

51:23.380 --> 51:24.848
- It's fine.

51:24.848 --> 51:26.120
All right, I just wanted to let you know

51:26.120 --> 51:27.810
that I am working on a few things,

51:27.810 --> 51:31.110
but I didn't find anything
to alert you with.

51:31.110 --> 51:33.280
All I need today is just
the usual signature.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.613
- A signature, may I inquire as to why?

51:37.530 --> 51:38.510
- He doesn't know?

51:38.510 --> 51:39.640
- No.

51:39.640 --> 51:42.620
- I didn't think this was
something you'd keep a secret.

51:42.620 --> 51:43.900
- Oh, it doesn't concern him.

51:43.900 --> 51:47.080
Like I said, he's just
a friend of the wife.

51:47.080 --> 51:47.913
Just give me the paper.

51:47.913 --> 51:49.070
- Has there been a crime, officer?

51:49.070 --> 51:50.430
Should I be alarmed?

51:50.430 --> 51:51.723
- Absolutely not.

51:51.723 --> 51:53.410
- He was just leaving, John.

51:53.410 --> 51:54.490
He's not important.

51:54.490 --> 51:56.270
I'll just sign the papers, huh.

51:56.270 --> 51:58.410
- Can you explain to me, this relationship

51:58.410 --> 52:00.380
between this gentleman and your wife?

52:00.380 --> 52:01.480
- Coworkers.

52:01.480 --> 52:03.850
- But I thought you said
Marcia was a homeworker,

52:03.850 --> 52:05.750
a stay at home wife, is what you said.

52:07.140 --> 52:08.807
- Ex-coworker.

52:08.807 --> 52:12.809
You know, they worked
together at the, you know,

52:12.809 --> 52:15.372
at the goddamn supermarket, I don't know,

52:15.372 --> 52:16.765
why don't you ask her?

52:16.765 --> 52:19.363
- Spin class, actually,
he's the dog walker.

52:19.363 --> 52:21.230
(chuckling) It doesn't really even matter.

52:21.230 --> 52:23.300
Sweetheart, why don't
you just sign the papers

52:23.300 --> 52:25.370
so that Detective John
can be on his way, huh?

52:25.370 --> 52:26.203
Just sign.

52:29.735 --> 52:32.902
(soft dramatic music)

52:33.899 --> 52:37.066
(light switch clicks)

52:44.485 --> 52:45.917
(Julius sighs)

52:45.917 --> 52:46.750
- Okay.

52:47.754 --> 52:49.264
Anything else?

52:49.264 --> 52:50.713
- No that is it.

52:52.620 --> 52:54.460
I'll be in touch.

52:54.460 --> 52:55.560
- [Julius] Sure.

52:55.560 --> 52:56.433
Thanks.

52:56.433 --> 52:59.056
- [Mcglone] You're welcome.

52:59.056 --> 53:01.306
- [Marcia] Have a nice day.

53:05.230 --> 53:06.202
- Bitch.

53:06.202 --> 53:07.473
- You whore.

53:14.320 --> 53:17.553
- I feel bad for you kid, I do.

53:21.430 --> 53:22.493
But he's a father.

53:25.650 --> 53:28.220
That's what any father would
do in these circumstances.

53:28.220 --> 53:29.053
You understand?

53:29.911 --> 53:31.187
I don't blame him.

53:32.889 --> 53:35.743
Best thing for you to do, now, is confess.

53:40.690 --> 53:41.640
Do the right thing.

53:44.720 --> 53:46.360
Just do it.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.103
It may be your only chance.

53:51.670 --> 53:52.503
Just do it.

54:01.936 --> 54:05.269
(ax dragging on ground)

54:08.780 --> 54:11.947
(light switch clicks)

54:13.532 --> 54:15.427
- What the hell was that?

54:15.427 --> 54:17.173
No one told you to speak.

54:18.258 --> 54:19.573
- This is getting juicy.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.940
When I asked you for a little
action and drama in my life,

54:25.940 --> 54:28.870
I never thought it was gonna be this good.

54:28.870 --> 54:29.740
- What the hell's he talking about?

54:29.740 --> 54:31.410
- Nothing, okay.

54:31.410 --> 54:32.243
Nothing.

54:32.243 --> 54:33.076
- Obviously, you know.

54:33.076 --> 54:34.280
You fucked this up.

54:34.280 --> 54:36.243
- What was that price we agreed upon?

54:38.965 --> 54:40.600
- I just wanna kill you both.

54:40.600 --> 54:43.283
- You know, you got too
much on your hands, pal.

54:44.680 --> 54:47.890
Your choices are limited,
almost non-existent.

54:47.890 --> 54:49.740
You're gonna pay me.

54:49.740 --> 54:52.400
You're gonna pay me, boy.

54:52.400 --> 54:53.283
I own you.

54:54.343 --> 54:55.563
I own you good.

54:57.010 --> 54:59.065
50 large.

54:59.065 --> 55:01.600
- We agreed on 40,000, okay.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.434
- 50.

55:02.434 --> 55:03.490
- 40,000.

55:03.490 --> 55:04.620
- 10, that's all you're gonna get.

55:04.620 --> 55:07.170
- No, you're gonna pay me
50 and I'll tell you why.

55:08.086 --> 55:08.947
Because-

55:08.947 --> 55:11.482
(Marcia grunting)

55:11.482 --> 55:13.240
(dramatic music)

55:13.240 --> 55:18.240
(Marcia grunting)
(flesh squelching)

55:22.670 --> 55:23.910
- What did you do?

55:24.861 --> 55:27.168
- Just getting rid of
the problem, baby, okay?

55:27.168 --> 55:28.920
- Are you outta your goddamn mind?

55:28.920 --> 55:30.310
- He was trying to extort us.

55:30.310 --> 55:32.000
It had to be done.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.971
- Well, if you didn't bring
this asshole into our house,

55:33.971 --> 55:35.673
we wouldn't have had this
problem to begin with.

55:36.864 --> 55:38.814
You just killed the man in our kitchen.

55:39.780 --> 55:40.640
- So?

55:40.640 --> 55:42.568
- Are you kidding me?

55:42.568 --> 55:44.318
What are we gonna do?

55:47.650 --> 55:49.668
- Tell me something, Julius.

55:49.668 --> 55:51.250
What were, what were you gonna do

55:51.250 --> 55:53.150
with your little experiment
in the basement, huh?

55:53.150 --> 55:55.950
What, you were just gonna let
him, let him go free, huh?

55:57.100 --> 55:58.890
If he told you what you needed to hear,

55:58.890 --> 56:01.160
what you wanted to hear,
what were you gonna do?

56:01.160 --> 56:02.963
Just let him go, and let him live?

56:03.900 --> 56:06.712
Now, I know you are stupid,

56:06.712 --> 56:10.200
but I don't think that
you are that stupid.

56:10.200 --> 56:11.812
- I'll get rid of the body.

56:11.812 --> 56:12.850
(Marcia sighs)

56:12.850 --> 56:16.070
- You need to kill that kid.

56:16.070 --> 56:16.990
- [Julius] I know.

56:16.990 --> 56:19.400
- He leaves this house,
baby, you and I are done.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.080
We are done, our lives are over.

56:21.080 --> 56:22.392
- I know.

56:22.392 --> 56:23.523
- And you,

56:25.670 --> 56:28.080
you need to let go of Annabelle too.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.629
- Just shut up!

56:29.629 --> 56:33.212
(Marcia breathing heavily)

56:40.230 --> 56:45.230
♪ Somehow you found me ♪

56:45.429 --> 56:50.429
♪ When life was not so kind ♪

56:52.449 --> 56:57.449
♪ I believe that you saved me ♪

56:58.121 --> 57:02.145
♪ And you gave me peace of mind ♪

57:02.145 --> 57:04.978
(Marcia laughing)

57:07.778 --> 57:10.611
(Stan scrambling)

57:15.783 --> 57:18.091
- [Stan] Come on, you son of a bitch.

57:18.091 --> 57:20.564
(object dragging)

57:20.564 --> 57:23.231
(Stan groaning)

57:28.722 --> 57:31.722
(rope bind rubbing)

57:42.751 --> 57:43.918
- Pretty girl.

57:45.038 --> 57:48.205
(soft dramatic music)

57:48.205 --> 57:50.622
Who's a pretty girl now, huh?

57:54.883 --> 57:56.800
You're the pretty girl.

58:15.685 --> 58:16.935
You're a whore.

58:19.236 --> 58:21.236
You are a goddamn whore.

58:28.015 --> 58:30.182
You are a goddamn a whore!

58:32.558 --> 58:33.808
You're a whore!

58:37.890 --> 58:39.755
You're a whore.

58:39.755 --> 58:40.588
As usual.

58:42.488 --> 58:45.488
(breathing heavily)

58:48.013 --> 58:50.763
(cards flicking)

58:59.319 --> 59:00.152
Oh my.

59:00.152 --> 59:02.680
- What do my cards read today?

59:02.680 --> 59:05.760
- Child, Madam Marcia sees
some really good things

59:05.760 --> 59:07.820
in your future, your near future.

59:07.820 --> 59:12.723
In fact, I see a new hot love
interest coming your way.

59:12.723 --> 59:15.556
(Marcia laughing)

59:16.430 --> 59:17.263
Oh.

59:17.263 --> 59:19.010
(gasps)

59:19.010 --> 59:20.350
It's gone.

59:20.350 --> 59:21.380
- What's gone?

59:21.380 --> 59:22.760
- My premonition.

59:22.760 --> 59:25.977
Gone, boom, gone.
- Why?

59:25.977 --> 59:28.670
- Well, you know, Mary Louise,

59:28.670 --> 59:30.820
sometimes you need a little help,

59:30.820 --> 59:32.700
getting the message to come
through from the other side?

59:32.700 --> 59:33.980
You know. (laughs)

59:33.980 --> 59:36.080
- You need some help with my scarf, right?

59:37.010 --> 59:38.113
- Seriously, woman?

59:41.618 --> 59:44.368
(Marcia humming)

59:45.380 --> 59:46.213
Oh.

59:46.213 --> 59:48.778
You know, that's nice, but
I'm still a little fuzzy.

59:48.778 --> 59:51.028
(laughing)

59:52.198 --> 59:53.890
Thank you, thank you.

59:53.890 --> 59:57.390
Ooh, well, all of a
sudden, I see clearly now.

59:57.390 --> 59:59.720
All righty, all righty, well.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.720
Ooh, child, he is tall, he's good-looking,

01:00:05.763 --> 01:00:07.860
he's dark, no, no, no.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.730
Oh, no, no, no, he's a
little pale, a little pale.

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:12.833
- Is he a doctor?

01:00:13.753 --> 01:00:16.500
- Well, of course he is, sweetheart.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.333
Of course.

01:00:17.333 --> 01:00:20.120
- Ooh, I like these games.
(clapping)

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.530
- Games?

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:23.477
These ain't games, Mary Louise, okay.

01:00:23.477 --> 01:00:24.823
These are my premonitions.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.723
You know what?

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:29.630
Your time is up for today, mm-hmm.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:30.720
- Okay.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.320
Just wish it wasn't so expensive.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.842
- Well, Mary Louise,
nothing's for free, is it?

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.532
Nothing's for free.

01:00:38.532 --> 01:00:42.000
Now, why don't we go have
some tea in my garden?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.880
Okay?

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.153
Come on, darling.

01:00:51.245 --> 01:00:53.828
(Julius sighs)

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:23.053
- I don't know what to do. (laughs)

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.923
Not a clue.

01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:32.500
I guess I'm just gonna have to...

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.380
What I'd like to...

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:39.573
Wait.

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:46.330
I have come to the
conclusion that you must die.

01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:51.343
I didn't wanna do this.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.613
I thought you would just
tell me where my Belle is.

01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:58.143
Did she run away?

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:03.677
Did you hurt my Annabelle?

01:02:11.121 --> 01:02:11.971
This, right here,

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:16.857
this is the most I've
ever gotten out of you.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.383
This is good.

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.963
Why did it take so long?

01:02:28.738 --> 01:02:30.543
Did somebody kill my daughter?

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:33.240
- Unbound me.

01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.748
- Did you kill my daughter?

01:02:34.748 --> 01:02:36.733
- Unbound me.

01:02:37.917 --> 01:02:39.270
- Answer my question.

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:40.343
- Unbound me.

01:02:41.336 --> 01:02:44.086
(punch smacking)

01:02:49.746 --> 01:02:51.217
I know.

01:02:51.217 --> 01:02:52.217
- Know what?

01:02:54.294 --> 01:02:55.294
- Annabelle.

01:02:58.673 --> 01:03:00.023
- What the fuck did you do?

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.133
- No, I won't tell you.

01:03:04.628 --> 01:03:05.703
- Why?

01:03:05.703 --> 01:03:07.920
I could kill you right now.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.920
- [Stan] That's why.

01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:11.160
- No. No.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.450
Now is not the time to play the bigshot.

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:15.943
Your options have run out.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.480
- It'll be worth the wait.

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:20.683
- When?

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:26.600
- I want food and water.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:31.443
Yeah, a nice, deluxe cheeseburger
with a side of home fries.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.070
And maybe some kindness
from you, just a little bit.

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:36.903
- Fuck that.

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:39.913
You're lying to me, and I know it.

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:42.357
I can feel it.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.474
I don't trust you.

01:03:44.474 --> 01:03:45.870
- You don't have to trust me.

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.180
- What game are you playing?

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.493
- No game. No game.

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.210
(Stan sighs)

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:56.210
But now is not the time to be a bigshot.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.272
Your options have run out.

01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:04.272
(whistling lightly)

01:04:05.432 --> 01:04:08.182
(chain jangling)

01:04:10.111 --> 01:04:12.611
- If you're lying to me, Stan,

01:04:13.587 --> 01:04:14.754
I'll kill you.

01:04:34.491 --> 01:04:36.430
- So I bought this down on Bourbon Street.

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:39.090
They had a good sale, good
sale, I tell you, girl.

01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:41.063
- Make me a burger, bitch.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.833
- How dare you?

01:04:46.809 --> 01:04:49.103
Never gonna make you no goddamn burger.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.970
Maybe I should make you a
burger, maybe you'll choke on it.

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:53.803
Redneck bastard.

01:05:04.956 --> 01:05:07.956
(car keys jangling)

01:05:10.085 --> 01:05:13.085
(car door creaking)

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:20.243
- I got him.

01:05:20.243 --> 01:05:21.560
- Jesus, Julius, what are you doing here?

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.509
- I got him.

01:05:22.509 --> 01:05:23.342
- Who?

01:05:23.342 --> 01:05:24.175
Make sense.

01:05:24.175 --> 01:05:26.140
- The kid, he confessed.

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:28.080
Well, something like that.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.483
- You gotta keep it down, all right.

01:05:29.483 --> 01:05:31.003
This is my place of work.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.763
- The kid told me that he
would tell me everything.

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:39.083
- Wait, I don't get it.

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:40.933
Except did he say he did it or not?

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.570
- Well, not exactly.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.623
He asked for food, for a burger.

01:05:48.921 --> 01:05:52.597
Those were his conditions, negotiation.

01:05:52.597 --> 01:05:53.807
- All right, I'm not quite getting this.

01:05:53.807 --> 01:05:56.920
Did the kid say he did it or not?

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.510
- Well, not exactly,

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:02.893
but he's gonna tell me
everything that went down.

01:06:04.112 --> 01:06:06.733
That's what he told me. (laughing)

01:06:06.733 --> 01:06:08.333
- That don't make sense, Julius.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.470
He's just telling you what you wanna hear,

01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:12.303
all right.
- No.

01:06:12.303 --> 01:06:13.305
- He's gotta have some sort of-

01:06:13.305 --> 01:06:14.330
- No.

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:15.163
- Yeah.

01:06:16.269 --> 01:06:17.653
- No, I don't believe that.

01:06:17.653 --> 01:06:19.450
I don't believe you.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:20.600
- Julius, kill the kid.

01:06:22.072 --> 01:06:23.510
- What if he knows what
happened to my daughter?

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:25.190
- He doesn't know.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.970
- What if he knows the
people who were involved?

01:06:27.970 --> 01:06:29.650
- He doesn't know anybody.

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.310
- He's gotta know something, this kid.

01:06:31.310 --> 01:06:33.100
What if he leads me to-

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.833
- Julius, kill the fucking kid!

01:06:37.153 --> 01:06:38.343
Goddamn it.

01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:40.850
- I can't kill him.

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:42.350
I know that killing is murder.

01:06:44.257 --> 01:06:45.803
I can't, I can't do it.

01:06:45.803 --> 01:06:48.078
- If you don't kill him, then I will.

01:06:48.078 --> 01:06:48.911
God.

01:06:53.423 --> 01:06:56.173
I got a meeting to go to, Julius.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.223
All right, get the fuck out of here.

01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:03.350
Go on, go!

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:04.750
We'll talk about this later.

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.700
I'll come by the house.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.140
- [Julius] You come on by.

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:12.923
- I'll be by.

01:07:12.923 --> 01:07:13.756
- [Julius] All right.

01:07:13.756 --> 01:07:15.473
- And don't come out here again.

01:07:17.513 --> 01:07:19.779
(car keys jangling)

01:07:19.779 --> 01:07:23.362
(car ignition error beeps)

01:07:31.283 --> 01:07:34.283
(hand banging)
Fuck!

01:07:36.199 --> 01:07:39.199
(car keys jangling)

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.747
Goddamn it!

01:07:41.747 --> 01:07:44.914
(soft dramatic music)

01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:19.903
- Julius.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.033
- Joel.

01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:24.433
- Want me to buy you a beer?

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:26.203
- No need.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.313
Mike, let me get the usual.

01:08:31.029 --> 01:08:32.130
- Sorry, Julius, I can't.

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:34.130
The manager says you're bill's too high.

01:08:35.006 --> 01:08:37.470
- What the hell's going on, Mike?

01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:39.130
What are you, are you snitching on me?

01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:41.460
- Mike, it's okay.

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.210
Give him what he wants, it's on me.

01:08:48.928 --> 01:08:50.845
You don't look so good.

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:57.327
- Well, you know, life is
kinda being a prick, right now.

01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:06.767
- Any news from them cops you
have on the trail of our kids?

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:07.743
- No.

01:09:14.801 --> 01:09:17.917
- I'm starting to get a real
weird feeling about all this.

01:09:17.917 --> 01:09:20.243
- How do you figure?

01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:23.502
- Lack of communication, lack
of info, all around bullshit.

01:09:24.505 --> 01:09:28.300
- Well, you know, Joel, I'm
in the same boat as you.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.133
- No you're not.

01:09:30.202 --> 01:09:32.600
- Think I got secrets, Joel?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.763
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

01:09:33.763 --> 01:09:34.990
(Julius laughing)

01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.903
- And you don't?

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:39.529
- Look, I don't know what it is

01:09:39.529 --> 01:09:41.080
you think you're trying to say.

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:43.723
- We're from the same parish.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.151
Shit, I think we were even
in love with the same girl.

01:09:48.151 --> 01:09:48.984
- What?

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.100
- I'm not talking about your wife,

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.613
I'm not talking about Marcia.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.580
I'm talking about a young girl,

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.800
barely 14, didn't even start her life.

01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.272
- (laughs) What the hell
are you talking about?

01:10:00.272 --> 01:10:01.322
- (laughs) It's okay.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.093
Take it easy.

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:05.743
I'm past that.

01:10:07.167 --> 01:10:09.143
The whole town is past it.

01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:13.914
Tell me, Joel, where did you bury her?

01:10:13.914 --> 01:10:15.320
- What the hell are you...

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.280
Julius, you're out of your mind, man.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.830
- I knew that you were jealous.

01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:20.603
I'd watch you.

01:10:20.603 --> 01:10:23.540
I took pride in knowing
that you were jealous

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.740
of the attention that
Rebecca would give me.

01:10:33.161 --> 01:10:36.050
I know you killed her, Joel.

01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.950
I lived with that.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:42.653
I never said a word.

01:10:44.086 --> 01:10:45.461
Yeah.

01:10:45.461 --> 01:10:46.294
Good evening.

01:10:46.294 --> 01:10:48.259
- I swear to God.

01:10:48.259 --> 01:10:51.540
I swear, you spread this rumor
around town, I swear I'll...

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.373
- You're gonna what?

01:10:52.373 --> 01:10:53.767
You wanna kill me too?

01:10:56.162 --> 01:10:58.463
We all got secrets, asshole.

01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:00.540
Some worse than others.

01:11:02.656 --> 01:11:05.193
I know that your boy killed my daughter.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.660
I guess it runs in the family.

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:13.867
I suppose God will give him
what he deserves. (laughing)

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:27.245
(gentle music)

01:11:27.245 --> 01:11:28.877
- [Marcia] Well, let's
see what the cards have

01:11:28.877 --> 01:11:30.027
in store for you today.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.740
Can I tell you something, Mary Louise?

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:36.234
- Sure.

01:11:36.234 --> 01:11:38.970
- You realize that all
this card playing nonsense,

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:40.348
it's all bullshit, right?

01:11:40.348 --> 01:11:43.351
- I know.

01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:44.351
- The devil.

01:11:45.482 --> 01:11:47.630
(laughs) The devil is real.

01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:48.463
Oh yeah.

01:11:48.463 --> 01:11:50.243
Makes you do crazy things.

01:11:51.553 --> 01:11:55.301
- Well, I, I don't
understand you scaring me.

01:11:55.301 --> 01:11:56.134
- Am I?

01:11:58.150 --> 01:11:59.410
Well, sweetness,

01:11:59.410 --> 01:12:02.120
why don't we take a look at
what the cards are saying,

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.140
and maybe they can clear things up

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.490
for you a little bit, okay?

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.463
Dead, dead.

01:12:09.745 --> 01:12:13.997
Dead, dead, dead.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.363
- You okay?

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:18.055
- No.

01:12:18.055 --> 01:12:18.888
No.

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.913
I see things.

01:12:23.494 --> 01:12:24.839
- Like what?

01:12:24.839 --> 01:12:27.422
(Marcia sighs)

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:32.033
- Like my daughter.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.723
- Is she alive?

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:37.380
- No.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.323
No, she's dead.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:43.193
- Is it her ghost?

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:47.913
I don't understand this,
you said it was bullshit.

01:12:49.447 --> 01:12:52.973
- I don't know if it's her
ghost, or if it's my guilt.

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:57.960
I've done some terrible things.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.093
Some really, really bad things.

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.013
- Like what?

01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:07.863
- I killed a man.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.583
- What?

01:13:11.479 --> 01:13:15.690
- I killed him, right
upstairs, in my kitchen.

01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:18.903
Put a knife right in his back.

01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:22.360
Oh, everybody saw, everybody was looking,

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.373
and he was saying things, and,

01:13:26.212 --> 01:13:28.133
well, I had to protect my family.

01:13:30.537 --> 01:13:31.987
And you know the funny thing?

01:13:33.312 --> 01:13:35.243
(chuckles) He was almost my lover.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.393
Yeah.

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:40.183
'Cause Julius, you know.

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:46.137
Julius is, he gave up on
me and us, a long time ago.

01:13:48.133 --> 01:13:51.510
Well, I needed someone.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.343
You know.

01:13:53.394 --> 01:13:56.703
I needed someone to love me.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:00.023
- Why are you telling me this?

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:08.223
Marcia, I think it's time for me to go.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.053
- Yeah, I think you should go.

01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:17.713
I'm afraid I might kill your
sorry little sweet ass as well.

01:14:21.410 --> 01:14:24.380
- God will frown on you.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.280
- Really, darling?

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:31.989
Well, I guess that means
you're coming to hell with me!

01:14:31.989 --> 01:14:35.156
(Mary Louise screams)

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:43.970
- Forgive me, Father,
for I'm about to sin.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.463
I don't reach the last level of sanity.

01:14:50.923 --> 01:14:53.520
I know my daughter's dead.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.090
I've accepted the fact that
someone murdered my daughter,

01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:58.470
but it's time-

01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:03.030
- Julius, don't do what I
think you're planning to do.

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:06.400
God has his ways, they will be punished.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.000
- That I do not believe, Father.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.113
I must take this to the end.

01:15:14.097 --> 01:15:17.110
I have a man tied up in my basement.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:18.833
He's been there for four weeks.

01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:24.220
- Julius, please don't tell
me that you're planning to-

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:25.500
- I have to.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:26.563
This has to end.

01:15:28.125 --> 01:15:32.070
I know in my heart that
this man killed my daughter

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:35.213
and I demand before him
blood runs in this family.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:38.580
I couldn't dig deep
enough to kill this boy,

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.223
but tonight I will.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.963
Now you may do whatever it is

01:15:42.963 --> 01:15:45.470
that you think you might
need to do when I leave here,

01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:47.163
and I will forgive you.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.253
- Why would you tell me this?

01:15:52.489 --> 01:15:54.710
- If there's only one person smiling at me

01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:58.557
at the gates of heaven or
hell, I'd rather it be you.

01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:17.418
(door clattering)

01:16:17.418 --> 01:16:20.168
(Julius sighing)

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.503
I see you there.

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:31.770
You look like you did
something wrong. (laughs)

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:34.023
- Nothing more wrong
than what you've done.

01:16:37.455 --> 01:16:40.153
You know we can't fix this Julius, okay?

01:16:41.976 --> 01:16:46.976
And there comes a time in every man's life

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.670
when he has to do what he has to do

01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:53.781
in order to save his family.

01:16:53.781 --> 01:16:56.046
- To avenge his family.

01:16:56.046 --> 01:16:57.753
I know he killed Annabelle.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.223
I see it in his eyes,
he just won't confess.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.313
I never wanted to take a life.

01:17:06.378 --> 01:17:09.633
But you were right, Phil was right.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:15.253
He must die so that I can rest.

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.870
- So that we can rest, baby.

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:19.063
So that we can rest.

01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:22.060
- Our lives are over, Marcia.

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:22.893
- No, no, no.

01:17:22.893 --> 01:17:24.112
- There's no turning back.

01:17:24.112 --> 01:17:25.260
- No, baby, don't say that, okay.

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.340
No, listen to me, look at me.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.760
Look at me, I'm sorry.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.593
Okay?

01:17:28.593 --> 01:17:32.360
I'm sorry for letting
another man come between us.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:33.900
I love you.

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.733
I love you so much.

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:35.647
I'm sorry, baby.

01:17:35.647 --> 01:17:37.451
- And I did love you.

01:17:37.451 --> 01:17:38.540
(Marcia sobbing)

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.520
We are over.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.353
- Baby.

01:17:40.353 --> 01:17:41.186
- We are done.

01:17:41.186 --> 01:17:42.299
- Don't say that, baby, please.

01:17:42.299 --> 01:17:43.149
- I have nothing.

01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.982
- I'm sorry.

01:17:43.982 --> 01:17:45.605
I'm sorry, babe, forgive me.

01:17:45.605 --> 01:17:47.080
I'm sorry.
- But you are my family.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.000
- (sobbing) Julius.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.696
- I will avenge my family.

01:17:49.696 --> 01:17:50.529
- Please.

01:17:50.529 --> 01:17:51.362
Please.

01:17:51.362 --> 01:17:53.218
(Marcia sobbing)

01:17:53.218 --> 01:17:55.473
(kissing)

01:17:55.473 --> 01:17:58.390
- I'm gonna see you in hell, Marcia.

01:17:59.273 --> 01:18:00.313
(Marcia sobbing)

01:18:00.313 --> 01:18:01.520
- Julius, please.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.803
Julius, I love you.

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:03.744
Baby, please don't go.

01:18:03.744 --> 01:18:05.262
Please, please, Julius.

01:18:05.262 --> 01:18:07.430
Baby, please don't leave
me here, okay, baby?

01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:09.757
Baby, please don't leave me here.

01:18:09.757 --> 01:18:13.315
Please.

01:18:13.315 --> 01:18:16.572
(Marcia sobbing)

01:18:16.572 --> 01:18:18.413
(sobbing) Baby, please don't.

01:18:18.413 --> 01:18:20.501
Don't leave me by myself.

01:18:20.501 --> 01:18:22.776
Baby, please, I beg you, please.

01:18:22.776 --> 01:18:27.659
Don't leave me here,
Julius, please. (sobs)

01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:30.933
Baby, please come back. (sobs)

01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:33.620
Julius, please.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.043
I'm so sorry.

01:18:40.185 --> 01:18:43.352
(soft dramatic music)

01:18:48.493 --> 01:18:49.326
- Oh.

01:18:53.359 --> 01:18:58.359

I have always loved you, Julius,

01:19:49.639 --> 01:19:51.889
and I will always love you,

01:19:52.805 --> 01:19:54.055
no matter what.

01:19:57.339 --> 01:20:01.339
But you (scoffs) gave up on me.

01:20:02.794 --> 01:20:03.627
Yeah.

01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:08.613
You just went ahead
and just gave up on me.

01:20:13.088 --> 01:20:14.671
I need to know why.

01:20:18.774 --> 01:20:19.607
Why?

01:20:21.021 --> 01:20:23.354
Why would you give up on me?

01:20:30.966 --> 01:20:35.966
(punches smacking)
(Marcia groaning)

01:20:41.141 --> 01:20:41.974
Oh God.

01:21:32.003 --> 01:21:34.170

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:45.466
Oh my God,

01:21:47.141 --> 01:21:48.724
I'm heartily sorry,

01:21:50.579 --> 01:21:52.579
for having offended thee

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.120
and I detest all my sins

01:22:02.832 --> 01:22:07.580
because of thy just punishment.

01:22:13.246 --> 01:22:14.496
God forgive me.

01:22:17.384 --> 01:22:19.265
(sobbing)

01:22:19.265 --> 01:22:20.515
God forgive me.

01:22:22.945 --> 01:22:25.112
(sobbing)

01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:32.625

(door clicking)

01:22:58.431 --> 01:23:00.447
- Well, you're out of luck, boy.

01:23:00.447 --> 01:23:01.743
You ain't getting shit.

01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:04.185
What the fuck?

01:23:04.185 --> 01:23:06.118

(punch smacking)
(Julius groaning)

01:23:07.759 --> 01:23:09.550
- I won't let you kill me.

01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:10.770
- Take it easy.

01:23:10.770 --> 01:23:12.163
- What, just like you did with me?

01:23:12.163 --> 01:23:13.633
- Are you kidding me?

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.134
(punch smacking)

01:23:17.134 --> 01:23:18.050

01:23:23.058 --> 01:23:25.891
(Julius grunting)

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.757
I did not wanna kill you, I
just wanna know the truth.

01:23:32.617 --> 01:23:35.173
- The truth, you'll never know.

01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:39.643
- Did you kill my daughter?

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.873
- I loved your daughter.

01:23:43.367 --> 01:23:46.300
- Who, who took my baby?

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:47.800
- I don't know the answer,

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.593
I don't know the end of this story.

01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:53.425
- I hate you!

01:23:53.425 --> 01:23:55.760
I hate you.

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.237
- Julius Fonteneau,

01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:02.326
I forgive you, but I
pray you burn in hell.

01:24:02.326 --> 01:24:05.076
(Stan screaming)

01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:09.107

(Stan screaming)

01:24:16.281 --> 01:24:17.823
- [Stan] No, no.

01:24:17.823 --> 01:24:19.489
God, no.

01:24:19.489 --> 01:24:22.489
(Stan coughing)

01:24:22.489 --> 01:24:23.572
No, God, God.

01:24:27.994 --> 01:24:31.661
(light bulb glass smashing)

01:24:44.332 --> 01:24:45.415
- You did it.

01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:48.963
You finally fucking did it.

01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:51.503
Amen, brother.

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:54.440
It had to be done.

01:24:55.737 --> 01:24:57.453
You had to do what you did.

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:01.430
I'll clean up, okay?

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:02.780
I'll take care of the body.

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.863
You get yourself together. (laughs)

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.510
Fuck, yeah.

01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:12.843
(soft orchestral music)

01:25:51.599 --> 01:25:54.643
- How did this all happen to me, Lord?

01:25:58.690 --> 01:26:01.023
Now you've gotten to see how I feel.

01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:07.193
For four months, now,

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.843
my life has been one continuous torment,

01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:14.793
one continuous torture,

01:26:16.694 --> 01:26:19.003
the torture of not knowing.

01:26:21.952 --> 01:26:24.035
But now I've found peace.

01:26:26.316 --> 01:26:27.316
Now, I know.

01:26:30.837 --> 01:26:33.630
I've come to believe, through all this,

01:26:36.269 --> 01:26:38.220
we make our own heaven.

01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.928
(flame roaring)

01:26:40.928 --> 01:26:43.678
(dramatic music)

01:26:51.023 --> 01:26:54.106
But today, we're all burning in hell.

01:26:57.742 --> 01:27:01.075
(dramatic choral music)

01:27:07.062 --> 01:27:09.979
(flames crackling)

01:27:37.278 --> 01:27:40.945
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:28:07.655 --> 01:28:08.488
- Oh.

01:28:13.748 --> 01:28:15.081
Okay, thank you.

01:28:17.948 --> 01:28:21.510
(car keys jangling)
(car engine starting)

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:24.510
(soft, grave music)

01:28:52.002 --> 01:28:55.919
(police siren wailing rapidly)

01:29:01.675 --> 01:29:04.925
(police siren wailing)

01:29:19.574 --> 01:29:22.157
(Joel sobbing)

01:29:29.142 --> 01:29:30.642
- God is with you.

01:29:32.247 --> 01:29:33.080
- No!

01:29:34.773 --> 01:29:35.606
No!

01:29:38.785 --> 01:29:39.702
No, no, no!

01:29:41.127 --> 01:29:44.544
(garage door clattering)

01:30:09.961 --> 01:30:13.780
- Miss Fonteneau, I guess
your daddy will never know

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.677
who killed you.

01:30:17.394 --> 01:30:20.894
(somber orchestral music)
