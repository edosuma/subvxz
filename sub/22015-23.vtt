00:01.392 --> 00:01.610
.

00:01.653 --> 00:03.742
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.786 --> 00:05.353
sexually based offenses

00:05.396 --> 00:07.050
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.094 --> 00:09.139
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.183 --> 00:11.054
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.098 --> 00:12.403
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.447 --> 00:14.405
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.449 --> 00:17.017
These are their stories.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.671
- "But Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Cotton-tail

00:19.715 --> 00:22.413
"had bread and milk

00:22.457 --> 00:25.025
"and blackberries
for dinner."

00:25.068 --> 00:28.071
All right, sweetie,
let's get you to bed.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.681
Okay?

00:33.424 --> 00:35.252
Aww.

00:35.296 --> 00:38.168
I know, it's--
it's a little babyish.

00:38.212 --> 00:39.648
- I like it.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.390
It was
Grandma Sheila's favorite.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.567
I told her
today we'd read it.

00:45.610 --> 00:47.438
- And we did.

00:47.482 --> 00:48.744
And you know what?

00:48.787 --> 00:52.704
Grandma Sheila
was really happy to see you.

00:52.748 --> 00:55.664
- When will she get out
of the hospital?

00:55.707 --> 00:58.754
She doesn't look sick.

01:03.802 --> 01:06.849
You know, Noah...

01:10.896 --> 01:12.333
Do you remember,
honey--

01:12.376 --> 01:15.292
Do you remember
when I told you that...

01:15.336 --> 01:16.554
That Grandma Sheila

01:16.598 --> 01:20.558
is a different kind of sick?

01:22.386 --> 01:25.302
And she's sick
the way she thinks.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.522
- And she go
into the hospital

01:27.565 --> 01:29.219
so she can get better.

01:29.263 --> 01:32.135
- That's right.
- But she looks fine.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.356
Maybe she can get out soon.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.184
- Well, we'll just
wait and see.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.447
- Okay.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.494
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.627
You sleep well, okay?
- Okay.

01:51.589 --> 01:54.114
Oh, Lourdes!

01:54.157 --> 01:56.116
You look beautiful!

01:56.159 --> 01:58.161
Alan,
doesn't she look beautiful?

01:58.205 --> 01:59.684
- Beautiful!
- Thank you!

02:01.382 --> 02:02.861
- Where are you going,
Lourdes?

02:02.905 --> 02:04.820
- Oh, out dancing,
chamaco.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.171
- I want to come.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.607
- Ay, maybe next time,
chamaquita.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.435
But tonight, make sure
you brush your teeth

02:11.479 --> 02:13.263
with the timer
for two whole minutes, okay?

02:13.307 --> 02:14.395
- Okay, okay,
go, go, go.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.875
Have fun.
We will survive.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.790
- Not sure I will.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.618
- Listen, stay out
as late as you want.

02:20.662 --> 02:21.924
We're taking the kids
to my parents'

02:21.967 --> 02:23.447
in Greenwich
for the weekend.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.580
We're gonna leave first thing.
- Oh.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.843
- Thank you.
- Okay, bye.

02:32.456 --> 02:34.763
- The worst is "Mommy night."

02:34.806 --> 02:36.547
They all get buzzed
on Sancerre,

02:36.591 --> 02:38.767
pay zero attention
to their own kids.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.551
- Vodka soda,
extra lime.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.162
- Thank you.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.641
- And then she expects me
to run around

02:43.685 --> 02:45.861
after six toddlers!
No extra pay.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.733
- She looked at me
like I was asking

02:48.777 --> 02:50.822
for one of her kidneys.

02:50.866 --> 02:54.652
You are so lucky
the Buckleys are decent.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.480
- Yes, I am.
And they are.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.961
- No wonder you've
been there five years.

02:59.004 --> 03:01.398
But you don't want
to be a nanny

03:01.442 --> 03:05.315
the rest of your life.

03:05.359 --> 03:08.536
Hmm?

03:08.579 --> 03:11.756
Ooh, do you know him?

03:11.800 --> 03:13.323
He's cute!

03:13.367 --> 03:19.895
♪

03:22.941 --> 03:29.644
♪

03:29.687 --> 03:32.516
- And why am I here
and not at home

03:32.560 --> 03:34.562
playing video games
with Jayden?

03:34.605 --> 03:38.261
- One, Jayden's too young
to be playing video games.

03:38.305 --> 03:41.699
Two, my rat
He had these tickets,

03:41.743 --> 03:43.527
and there was no way
I was gonna let him have them.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.399
And three,
I needed company.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.704
- Company.

03:46.748 --> 03:49.272
Seems like you're
doing fine right now.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.926
- I'm just
enjoying the music.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.884
- Right.

03:52.928 --> 03:56.366
Oh, and my dog died,
and my truck broke down,

03:56.410 --> 04:00.022
and I'm starting to feel
like a third wheel.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.850
- I realize
it's Friday night.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.547
My social life is--
is--is great.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.983
Thanks for asking.

04:05.027 --> 04:07.029
Teresa, I gotta tell you,
I don't know what you've

04:07.072 --> 04:08.900
been waiting for,
but the last time I checked,

04:08.944 --> 04:10.859
all the billionaires
who look like George Clooney?

04:10.902 --> 04:13.427
They're taken,
you know?

04:13.470 --> 04:15.951
Hey, I gotta go.
All right, I love you.

04:15.994 --> 04:18.345
Tell Mia I love her, too,
all right?

04:18.388 --> 04:20.042
What do you got?

04:20.085 --> 04:21.696
- Picked up Mr. Smith here
on the C train

04:21.739 --> 04:23.524
offering to massage
women's feet

04:23.567 --> 04:25.395
with his penis.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.396
- That's great.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.877
- Come on.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.750
- You really don't
remember me?

04:32.794 --> 04:34.839
- I--I--
I don't.

04:34.883 --> 04:36.754
You're gorgeous.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.496
I don't see how
I'd forget meeting you.

04:39.540 --> 04:42.325
- It was a long time ago.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.719
- Sorry.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.416
- That's okay.

04:46.460 --> 04:50.594
We're here now,
aren't we?

04:50.638 --> 04:54.816
- Yes, we are.

05:00.038 --> 05:03.346
This is it.

05:08.656 --> 05:11.659
- I like it hot.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.359
- Show me,
show me more.

05:16.403 --> 05:19.449
- Let me show you.

05:19.493 --> 05:22.322
- Oh, yeah, baby.

05:23.801 --> 05:27.414
- I want to
show you something.

05:27.457 --> 05:30.373
- Show me, baby.
What do you got for me?

05:30.417 --> 05:32.462
- Hey, whoa, whoa!

05:34.072 --> 05:36.945
- No, I--
Wait, wait.

05:42.429 --> 05:49.436
♪

06:26.777 --> 06:30.738
- Okay, good night.
I mean, good morning.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.870
- Uh, I-- I have to talk
to a detective.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.394
- I'm off shift
right now,

06:34.437 --> 06:35.612
but somebody will be
right with you, okay?

06:35.656 --> 06:38.572
- I don't think
this can wait.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.271
- Please, don't do this.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.620
What do you want,
money?

06:43.664 --> 06:45.492
- I don't want
your money.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.798
- At first it was
some sex game gone wrong.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.409
Maybe an assault.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.802
- No!

06:51.846 --> 06:53.500
I found it
at a club last night.

06:53.543 --> 06:54.892
I was gonna try
and return it,

06:54.936 --> 06:56.459
so I turned off
the auto-lock feature

06:56.503 --> 06:58.200
and I woke up to this.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.680
I don't know,
it's some kind of camera app.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.464
You're telling me

07:01.508 --> 07:03.597
this is live
- Yes!

07:03.640 --> 07:05.337
And if you don't
do something about it,

07:05.381 --> 07:06.556
I think this guy's
gonna die.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.906
- Tell me
you remember me.

07:11.561 --> 07:14.434
I don't!
I don't know you!

07:14.477 --> 07:15.826
- Say that again.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.785
- I don't know you.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.482
I've never met you.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.702
- Oh, we've met.

07:21.745 --> 07:24.139
I'll never forget.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.620
I can hear your voice
in my nightmares.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.926
- That's not possible.
- No.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.624
You don't tell me
what's possible.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.582
I tell you
what's possible.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.671
What's impossible.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.499
To see your face.

07:36.543 --> 07:41.286
To hear your voice.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.332
Inhale your smell.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.900
Salt...
Sweat...

07:45.943 --> 07:49.512
Mineral...
Tequila...

07:49.556 --> 07:50.905
It's you.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.776
- You're insane.

07:52.820 --> 07:56.519
- Your breath is sweeter now,
yes.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.914
It's Cognac,
not cheap tequila.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.699
But your sweat...

08:02.743 --> 08:05.485
Your sweat
is still the same.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.618
If you're going to shoot me,
just shoot me!

08:08.662 --> 08:10.707
- I give the orders here!
Not you!

08:10.751 --> 08:13.318
- This is live-streaming,
and TARU can't trace it.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.668
- They say the IP address
is invisible.

08:14.711 --> 08:15.973
- Yeah,
it's gonna take a while.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.453
The feed's coming
through the dark net,

08:17.497 --> 08:18.846
hidden by onion protocol,
tor net.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.413
- Preferred network
of child porn users and worse.

08:21.457 --> 08:23.372
This is not a doggie cam.
- Can we see the kid

08:23.415 --> 08:25.374
who brought in the phone?
He had nothing to do with it?

08:25.417 --> 08:26.723
- He's got no record.
There's nothing to connect him

08:26.767 --> 08:28.203
to this kind of activity.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.857
Look, I don't know
what this is.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.380
There's no ransom demand--
- TARU traced the cell phone

08:31.423 --> 08:32.686
to a Miguel Lopez,

08:32.729 --> 08:33.948
billing address
720 Bleecker Street.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.385
- Go.
Go, go, go, go.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.648
- You don't have to do this.

08:44.436 --> 08:47.439
- If you want me
to say I'm afraid...

08:47.483 --> 08:50.007
Yes, I'm afraid.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.488
- Good.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.577
Look at me.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.231
Look at me.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.799
Do you see me?
- Yes.

08:58.842 --> 09:02.454
- Close your eyes.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.893
What color are my eyes?

09:05.936 --> 09:09.592
- Brown.

09:09.636 --> 09:10.854
- Brown.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.817
- Young, I--
I don't know.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.645
20, 25.

09:18.688 --> 09:22.866
- 23.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.869
I was 18
when you met me.

09:25.913 --> 09:29.743
- You...
You were 18?

09:29.786 --> 09:32.267
Five years ago,
I was living in Portland!

09:32.310 --> 09:33.921
Working for
a software company, I--

09:33.964 --> 09:36.010
I'll give you the number,
you can call personnel--

09:36.053 --> 09:38.839
- Shut up!
Look at me.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.319
I sound different now.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.626
I looked different then, too.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.672
I had hope.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.282
Life in my eyes.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.676
What do you see now?

09:49.719 --> 09:51.634
- You're beautiful.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.288
- Wrong.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.637
I was beautiful.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.640
You took that from me.

09:57.684 --> 10:01.035
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.084
You burned me.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.086
You cut me-- ven aca.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.784
- You said

10:10.827 --> 10:13.830
you were doing me a favor
by sparing my face.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.658
That you could
cut off my nose,

10:15.702 --> 10:17.051
or my ears.

10:17.094 --> 10:21.403
That I should be grateful
that beauty had value.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.581
- My God...

10:25.625 --> 10:28.018
Whoever did that to you...

10:28.062 --> 10:29.803
They deserve to die.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.369
But it wasn't me.

10:31.413 --> 10:34.372
- Yes, it was!

10:34.416 --> 10:35.809
So you know what?

10:35.852 --> 10:37.985
I'll return the favor.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.117
I'll shoot you
in the heart.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.692
- Yes.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.476
- Not much.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.478
He's a good tenant.
No noise, no trouble.

10:53.522 --> 10:54.741
- Does he have
a girlfriend?

10:54.784 --> 10:56.786
Maybe an ex?
Anyone with a grudge?

10:56.830 --> 10:59.006
- He keeps to himself.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.442
He travels a lot.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.878
He's got
a sick grandmother, I think.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.968
- Okay, all right,
just stand back. Thank you.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.672
- NYPD!

11:15.762 --> 11:17.111
- This is
the wrong apartment.

11:23.117 --> 11:26.468
- Sorry, pal.

11:30.428 --> 11:30.777
.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.780
- You didn't shoot me.

11:33.823 --> 11:34.955
You do believe in God.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.914
- No, I don't.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.829
But to just kill you,
that's too easy.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.441
- I want you to suffer.

11:43.485 --> 11:48.011
I want you to suffer
like I suffered.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.057
What are you going to do?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.449
- Torture you.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.364
Then kill you.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.192
Please.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.151
- She's gonna cut him.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.850
- We gotta find
this guy, fast.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.286
- Look,
Rollins and Carisi said

12:02.330 --> 12:04.158
that the super
ID'd him as Lopez.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.942
But wherever he is...

12:05.986 --> 12:07.857
It's not the same address
that's on his phone bill.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.337
- So why does he have an app

12:09.380 --> 12:11.252
with the security cameras
to this location?

12:11.295 --> 12:14.211
- Yeah,
on an invisible IP address.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.518
Where was the phone
supposedly found?

12:16.561 --> 12:18.738
- "Oscillate,"
a club in Chelsea.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.304
- Okay, so maybe
they know him there.

12:20.348 --> 12:23.351
- On it.
- I'm not who you think I am.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.222
- Miguel is so sweet.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.920
I locked myself out once
in my undies.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.922
He ran down to the doorman
to get the key.

12:28.965 --> 12:30.445
- Did he ever talk about
staying anywhere else?

12:30.488 --> 12:31.794
Maybe a friend's apartment?

12:31.838 --> 12:33.535
- No, not that I can recall.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.407
- I never saw him
with a woman.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.845
I thought maybe
he was gay.

12:38.888 --> 12:40.237
- I can't imagine
he was involved

12:40.281 --> 12:41.804
in anything illegal.
- We're not saying that.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.371
Did he ever mention
any family, friends,

12:43.414 --> 12:45.503
maybe someone whose apartment
that he had the keys to?

12:45.547 --> 12:46.940
- He didn't talk much.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.985
He was Spanish--
or Mexican, I guess.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.508
I could hear him on the phone
through the walls.

12:50.552 --> 12:51.988
- All right, thanks.

12:52.032 --> 12:54.121
Is that what this is about?

12:54.164 --> 12:55.818
- We're not sure,
to be honest.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.385
- Because if that's the case,
I will vouch for him.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.821
What's happening
in this country

12:58.865 --> 13:00.257
is a disgrace.

13:00.301 --> 13:03.826
- All right...
- Thanks.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.872
Get anything?
- Upstanding citizen

13:05.915 --> 13:07.917
who wouldn't hurt a fly.
- Yeah, well,

13:07.961 --> 13:09.484
that's not what she thinks.

13:09.527 --> 13:12.095
- I'm a nice guy,
a regular guy, I--

13:12.139 --> 13:13.880
I moved to New York City
a year ago

13:13.923 --> 13:15.533
from Portland.
I'm a website designer.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.145
- A website designer.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.407
Vos mira, you--

13:19.450 --> 13:21.235
You've done well
for yourself!

13:21.278 --> 13:24.368
- This isn't my apartment.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.283
And the owner's
due home today.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.111
- You're lying.
- No, no.

13:28.155 --> 13:31.158
He could walk in
any minute.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.943
If you leave now,

13:33.987 --> 13:37.599
we could forget
this ever happened.

13:37.642 --> 13:40.428
I'm sorry
for whatever happened to you.

13:40.471 --> 13:43.213
But I had nothing
to do with that.

13:43.257 --> 13:46.826
You have the wrong man.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.871
And I have
to use the bathroom.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.178
- You have to go, go.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.444
- You're a crazy bitch!

13:56.487 --> 13:58.011
- Now that's the man I know.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.317
- I'm sorry, I--

14:00.361 --> 14:02.145
What did I do to you?

14:02.189 --> 14:03.451
Is it because
I tried to pick you up

14:03.494 --> 14:05.148
at the club?
- I approached you.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.454
I recognized you!

14:06.497 --> 14:09.022
Remember!

14:09.065 --> 14:10.153
It's you.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.242
- I told you,
I'm a regular guy.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.027
I like to drink,

14:14.070 --> 14:16.290
go to night clubs,

14:16.333 --> 14:17.987
pick up strange women.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.947
Look how well
that turned out, huh?

14:20.990 --> 14:24.341
I'm joking, I--

14:24.385 --> 14:28.476
Am I allowed to laugh?

14:28.519 --> 14:32.175
- I like to laugh.

14:32.219 --> 14:36.484
To dance,
to go out.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.660
In the dark,
you can forget your past.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.228
You're a different version,

14:41.271 --> 14:46.102
a different person.
I understand that.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.365
- Did I meet you
at the club?

14:48.409 --> 14:49.584
What did I do to you?

14:49.627 --> 14:52.369
Did I promise to call
and never did?

14:52.413 --> 14:54.197
- It's not that.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.548
- You promised

14:57.592 --> 15:00.116
I'd never have
to see you again.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.251
- You see this guy
last night?

15:04.294 --> 15:06.209
- Jesus!
Uh, yeah,

15:06.253 --> 15:07.602
is he okay?
- No.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.082
What can you tell me
about him?

15:09.125 --> 15:10.953
- Uh,
that's Miguel Lopez.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.215
He comes in here
a few times a month,

15:12.259 --> 15:14.043
always tips well.
- Okay, so you know him.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.915
Was he with a woman?
- Uh, uh--

15:15.958 --> 15:17.699
Yeah, yeah,
he was here with someone.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.179
Um, uh--
dark hair.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.571
They seemed friendly.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.704
- He seem like he knew her,
or they just met?

15:22.747 --> 15:25.228
It's a club, man.
A few drinks, some blow,

15:25.272 --> 15:26.534
everyone acts like
they found their soul mate.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.057
How the hell do I know?
- True.

15:28.101 --> 15:32.453
- Look at this.

15:32.496 --> 15:35.021
- Yeah, that's her.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.197
Was she on your guest list?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.589
Did she come
with any friends?

15:38.633 --> 15:39.982
- No, I never saw her
in here before.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.331
- Huh...

15:41.375 --> 15:44.291
- Just tell me.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.597
Tell me where I met you...

15:46.641 --> 15:48.686
When...

15:48.730 --> 15:53.256
What I supposedly did.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.303
- You really don't
remember me?

15:56.346 --> 15:58.522
I mean that little to you.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.090
- No, I didn't say that.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.092
- Do you know
how that makes me feel?

16:03.136 --> 16:05.007
- There's no ID
on this woman from the club.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.661
- No, and nothing
on the facial-recognition

16:06.704 --> 16:08.054
from the security still,
either.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.359
- Okay, any update
from TARU?

16:09.403 --> 16:10.621
- They're still
running the trace,

16:10.665 --> 16:12.101
but the IP address
is hidden

16:12.145 --> 16:15.017
behind multiple encryptions.
- Wait.

16:15.061 --> 16:18.194
Is that sunlight
coming from the far window?

16:18.238 --> 16:19.630
That's eastern exposure.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.023
- Yeah.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.678
It's art Deco,
pre-war.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.596
You're wondering
who will show up

16:28.639 --> 16:30.293
to my funeral?
- Answer the question!

16:30.337 --> 16:31.729
- No.

16:31.773 --> 16:35.124
No, I'm not married.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.608
- Just lucky, I guess.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.175
Another bad joke.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.438
I never met
the right girl.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.660
- Would it even matter to you
if I said yes?

16:49.704 --> 16:51.749
- No.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.281
- I have children
I care for, but...

17:01.324 --> 17:03.413
You know that,
don't you?

17:03.457 --> 17:05.502
- I don't know anything
about you.

17:05.546 --> 17:09.028
- A boy and a girl.

17:09.071 --> 17:13.249
I love them like my own,
but they're not mine.

17:13.293 --> 17:15.643
They'll grow up one day.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.775
They'll forget
all about me.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.560
- You're young,
you can have kids.

17:19.603 --> 17:21.344
- No!

17:21.388 --> 17:25.696
I'll never have a husband!
I'll never have kids!

17:25.740 --> 17:27.524
Who would want me?

17:27.568 --> 17:28.830
I'm alone.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.789
No past, no future.
My life is over!

17:31.833 --> 17:34.749
Whatever I do to you,
I'll never be free!

17:34.792 --> 17:36.838
- Don't say that--
- Nothing matters!

17:36.881 --> 17:40.189
Nothing matters...

17:40.233 --> 17:42.757
What was I thinking?

17:42.800 --> 17:46.282
Nothing will change.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.198
Nothing will change.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.678
Not for me.

17:50.721 --> 17:54.856
Not ever.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.553
- Oh, my God,
where's she going?

17:56.597 --> 17:58.251
- She's gotta be going
to a terrace.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.210
That looks like
Central Park.

18:01.254 --> 18:02.646
- Yeah,
from the West side,

18:02.690 --> 18:04.387
looking to
the East side skyline.

18:04.431 --> 18:05.867
- Help.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.129
Help me.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.348
Help me!

18:08.391 --> 18:11.786
Help me!

18:11.829 --> 18:13.570
Oh, no!

18:13.614 --> 18:17.661
No!

18:17.705 --> 18:19.794
No!

18:19.837 --> 18:24.103
- She just killed herself.

18:31.806 --> 18:32.023
.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.722
Where is she?

18:34.765 --> 18:35.897
- She walked out of the room,

18:35.940 --> 18:37.072
and we heard a gunshot.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.639
- Okay,
so if we heard it,

18:38.682 --> 18:39.944
the neighbors
must have heard it too.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.859
- I'll see if ShotSpotters
picked it up.

18:41.903 --> 18:46.516
- See if 911 got any calls
about a gunshot.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.518
Guys, guys, hold on!
She's okay!

18:48.562 --> 18:50.955
She's alive.

18:52.957 --> 18:56.787
- I thought
you killed yourself.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.746
- I thought about it.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.704
I almost did.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.753
- If I'm going to be
your executioner,

19:05.796 --> 19:07.189
you deserve a fair trial.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.931
- With you as judge
and jury?

19:09.974 --> 19:12.412
- That's right.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.544
- If I confess...

19:14.588 --> 19:16.198
You'll let me
walk out of here?

19:16.242 --> 19:18.766
- Yes.
- I confess.

19:18.809 --> 19:21.116
Whatever you say
I did to you,

19:21.160 --> 19:22.770
I did it.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.512
Yes, I did.

19:25.555 --> 19:28.079
- Go on.

19:28.123 --> 19:31.213
- You were 18
when I met you.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.954
I drank tequila,

19:32.997 --> 19:35.826
and stole your life.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.959
- You remember me now.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.439
- Yes.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.224
I remember you.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.531
That's good.

19:44.574 --> 19:48.143
Keep going.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.797
- You want more,
you're going

19:49.840 --> 19:51.451
to have to tell me
what to say.

19:51.494 --> 19:54.628
- You cut me.
- Y-yes.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.630
I cut you...

19:56.673 --> 19:58.762
With my pocket knife.

19:58.806 --> 20:01.678
I burned you
with my cigar.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.160
- Okay, so far,
there's been six 911 calls

20:05.204 --> 20:07.075
about a gunshot
around 2 p.m.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.511
Turns out
it was a starter pistol

20:08.555 --> 20:09.991
for a 10K race
n Central Park.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.254
The starting line was at
the 77nd Street entrance.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.256
The Seventies?

20:14.300 --> 20:16.519
Every apartment building
on that block has terraces.

20:16.563 --> 20:20.001
- Right, let's move,
let's move.

20:21.785 --> 20:25.224
- Tactical team estimates
there are 10 to 12 buildings

20:25.267 --> 20:27.095
within earshot
of the starting pistol.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.966
- Okay.
We're looking

20:29.010 --> 20:30.272
for a terrace apartment,
probably a penthouse.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.622
- Pair up.
we'll divide the sector,

20:32.666 --> 20:34.145
grid-search each building.

20:34.189 --> 20:37.018
Proceed with caution.
Call for back-up.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.889
Nobody needs to be a hero.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.282
Let's go,
let's go!

20:40.326 --> 20:42.850
- You cut me...

20:42.893 --> 20:44.721
You burned me...

20:44.765 --> 20:46.593
You raped me.

20:46.636 --> 20:50.553
Admit it.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.076
- I didn't rape you.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.949
I've never raped anyone.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.038
Whoever did
these things to you,

20:57.081 --> 20:59.214
I'm sorry.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.999
I'm--I'm sorry
for your suffering.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.873
But what you're doing now,
this...

21:05.916 --> 21:10.617
This isn't going
to make you feel better.

21:10.660 --> 21:14.795
- You don't know that.

21:14.838 --> 21:17.928
- I know you have
a life here.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.235
In New York.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.977
Children who will miss you.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.719
I can help you.

21:25.762 --> 21:28.809
I have connections
with the police.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.941
I can tell them
what happened to you.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.773
I can help you.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.253
Let's get out of here.

21:38.297 --> 21:43.040
You want this over!

21:43.084 --> 21:44.912
- Yes.

21:44.955 --> 21:49.003
- Then untie me.

22:07.935 --> 22:10.111
- Jorge, don't come in here!
Call the police!

22:10.154 --> 22:11.286
Call for help!

22:11.330 --> 22:13.375
- Put your hands up!

22:13.419 --> 22:14.811
- She's crazy.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.160
She's going to kill me!

22:16.204 --> 22:17.771
Why?
- Shut up!

22:17.814 --> 22:20.643
Stop talking--
both of you stop talking!

22:20.687 --> 22:22.732
- She's crazy!
- Walk. Walk.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.908
Keep going.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.868
- Jorge!

22:27.911 --> 22:30.131
- Jorge!

22:30.174 --> 22:32.351
Stop!

22:32.394 --> 22:33.874
What are you doing?

22:41.185 --> 22:43.318
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.799
- I don't know!
- You're lying.

22:45.842 --> 22:49.629
You're lying to me.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.938
- The feed cut out.

22:54.982 --> 22:58.246
She disabled the camera.

22:58.289 --> 23:01.162
- The feed's down.
We're going blind.

23:01.205 --> 23:02.424
- NYPD.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.121
- Yeah--

23:04.165 --> 23:05.688
You got a penthouse
with a terrace?

23:05.732 --> 23:07.342
- Two, actually.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.432
Why?
- Now.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.087
- I need to check the log--

23:13.130 --> 23:14.741
- No, no, no.
We need access right now.

23:14.784 --> 23:17.221
Let us up.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.354
- Penthouse B.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.008
To the left.
- Fin.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.923
- The feed's down.
She found the camera.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.447
- I know.
- She's getting desperate.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.144
- Let's just hope
she doesn't look out the window

23:27.188 --> 23:31.322
and see a street
full of cops.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.715
Montero?

23:38.242 --> 23:39.940
- Just the maid.

23:39.983 --> 23:43.160
She may have heard something.

23:45.859 --> 23:49.079
- No, no, just take it easy.

23:58.915 --> 24:02.136
- Help, help!

24:02.179 --> 24:06.009
- Put the gun down!
Or I shoot him in the head!

24:06.053 --> 24:07.837
- Okay, let's--

24:07.881 --> 24:09.491
let's talk this through, okay?

24:11.275 --> 24:15.149
Put the gun down,
or I kill him.

24:23.636 --> 24:23.853
.

24:23.897 --> 24:26.508
- I screwed up, Lieutenant.
- There are about

24:26.552 --> 24:28.597
a hundred cops downstairs,
Miss--

24:28.641 --> 24:30.338
- You don't need
to know my name!

24:30.381 --> 24:32.688
- If we're gonna talk
like human beings, I...

24:32.732 --> 24:34.298
I do.
- This isn't

24:34.342 --> 24:35.517
a garden party, lady!

24:35.561 --> 24:36.866
It's not that hard!

24:36.910 --> 24:39.521
Either you drop your gun,
or I kill your friend.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.349
- Please, Lieutenant.

24:41.392 --> 24:42.524
Don't let her kill me,
I got--

24:42.568 --> 24:43.830
I got a wife.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.484
I've got a kid.

24:45.527 --> 24:46.963
- Okay.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.400
Okay.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.011
Let's--

24:51.054 --> 24:52.882
Let's all take
a breath, here, okay?.

24:52.926 --> 24:55.755
- Put it on the floor!

24:59.759 --> 25:01.935
- You've gotta give me
something in return.

25:01.978 --> 25:05.504
- How about
I don't kill your friend?

25:05.547 --> 25:08.550
Kick it over there,
nothing stupid.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.552
She's crazy!

25:10.596 --> 25:12.423
- Shut up,
or I shoot you next!

25:12.467 --> 25:13.729
- Listen to me.

25:13.773 --> 25:18.821
You haven't done anything
seriously wrong.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.606
You can walk out of here.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.827
I've got like, what,
three felonies here?

25:24.871 --> 25:27.003
Take out your cuffs.

25:27.047 --> 25:31.965
Not you!
Take out your cuffs.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.402
- Fin, over.

25:34.445 --> 25:35.882
- 221 CPW is clear.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.448
- Roger that.

25:37.492 --> 25:40.582
221 CPW is clear.

25:40.626 --> 25:41.975
Fin, over.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.804
- We're clear.
- Roger that.

25:44.847 --> 25:49.025
Got a big goose egg
at 173 CPW.

25:52.812 --> 25:55.815
- Please,
this man needs help.

25:55.858 --> 25:58.774
- We all need help!

25:58.818 --> 26:00.036
- Lieutenant.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.038
- It's okay.
You just do what she says.

26:02.082 --> 26:06.042
- Get up.

26:06.086 --> 26:09.350
Close that door.

26:14.573 --> 26:17.314
Sit on the couch.
- Just so you know,

26:17.358 --> 26:19.752
if you shoot
an NYPD lieutenant,

26:19.795 --> 26:22.624
you go to jail.
And you don't get out.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.495
- I'm not gonna shoot you.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.497
You're gonna be my witness.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.803
Let's go.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.892
Sit on the couch.
- Okay.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.328
Witness?

26:31.372 --> 26:33.113
Witness for what?
- You wanna stand

26:33.156 --> 26:34.636
and ask stupid questions,
be my guest!

26:34.680 --> 26:36.029
- Don't listen to her!
She's going to kill me!

26:36.072 --> 26:37.813
- Nobody's getting killed here.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.902
- Well, do something!

26:39.946 --> 26:41.904
Look at her.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.994
Sit.

26:47.388 --> 26:48.955
- Needle-in-a-haystack time.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.696
- More like needle
in a stack of needles.

26:50.739 --> 26:52.480
- I'll take this one.
- You know what, I--

26:52.523 --> 26:54.134
I called Liv
a few minutes ago.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.788
She's up there.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.399
- Lot of terraces.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.751
- Look,
he's tied up

27:02.795 --> 27:05.493
and I'm handcuffed.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.103
So you--
you can put the gun down,

27:07.147 --> 27:08.975
We don't want it
to go off accidentally.

27:09.018 --> 27:10.150
We don't want anyone
to get hurt.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.368
- I do!

27:11.412 --> 27:12.631
Besides,

27:12.674 --> 27:14.633
I know how to use a gun.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.591
Miguel here showed me.
Tell her!

27:16.635 --> 27:18.419
Tell her how you shot
those two girls

27:18.462 --> 27:19.986
right in front of me.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.988
- I didn't kill anybody.
I've never even held a gun!

27:22.031 --> 27:24.860
I'm a computer geek
with a degree from Gonzaga!

27:24.904 --> 27:27.994
For crying out loud, I--
- Stand up.

27:28.037 --> 27:31.824
- I'm not gonna do anything
with a gun pointed at me.

27:31.867 --> 27:35.915
Okay?

27:37.525 --> 27:40.006
Get up!
Get up.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.660
- Can--
can we just--

27:41.703 --> 27:44.880
- Look into his eyes.
Look into his eyes.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.448
- Put the gun down.
Put the gun down,

27:47.491 --> 27:50.712
and let's talk this--
- Kneel.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.715
- Okay, okay,
okay.

27:53.759 --> 27:57.023
Okay.
Okay.

27:57.066 --> 28:00.635
Okay.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.942
- Are those the eyes
of a geek?

28:02.985 --> 28:04.813
They're a killer's eyes.

28:04.857 --> 28:07.598
Rapist's eyes!

28:07.642 --> 28:09.078
- No!

28:09.122 --> 28:10.906
I didn't rape her, I--

28:10.950 --> 28:15.215
I have two sisters.

28:15.258 --> 28:19.828
- You said
that you wanted...

28:19.872 --> 28:22.483
Me to witness this.

28:22.526 --> 28:25.181
Why don't you tell me
what he did?

28:25.225 --> 28:29.533
I need to know
exactly what happened.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.928
- What do you think,
Miguel?

28:32.972 --> 28:34.625
Should I tell her?

28:34.669 --> 28:36.192
How you sat
in my mother's kitchen

28:36.236 --> 28:38.499
and told us how
you would get me to New York

28:38.542 --> 28:40.806
to work as a nanny
for a nice family?

28:40.849 --> 28:43.504
How I would be
a real American?

28:43.547 --> 28:45.114
Or how you shoved me
into a cooler

28:45.158 --> 28:48.465
in the back of your van
until we crossed the border?

28:48.509 --> 28:50.467
- I--

28:50.511 --> 28:52.643
How you cut me?

28:52.687 --> 28:55.124
How you burned me?

28:55.168 --> 28:57.953
And shoved a disgusting rag
into my mouth

28:57.997 --> 29:00.782
to keep me from screaming
when you raped me

29:00.826 --> 29:02.523
in the dirt in Texas?

29:02.566 --> 29:04.612
Over and over you raped me!

29:04.655 --> 29:07.746
- Listen to me,
I can help you.

29:09.617 --> 29:10.966
They gave you
a magic wand

29:11.010 --> 29:14.840
to erase what this demonio
did to me?

29:14.883 --> 29:17.886
- I've never been to Texas.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.758
Nev--

29:19.801 --> 29:22.151
- I'll never forget those eyes.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.197
That smell.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.808
- And the sound of his voice.

29:26.852 --> 29:30.681
And the way that he grunted.

29:30.725 --> 29:34.163
And the smell of his sweat.

29:34.207 --> 29:39.168
I have the same nightmares
as you do.

29:39.212 --> 29:42.258
I wake up in the middle
of the night, shaking.

29:43.738 --> 29:46.567
Gasping for air.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.745
The same as you.

29:52.312 --> 29:54.140
But this...

29:54.183 --> 29:58.753
Is not the way
to get justice.

29:59.972 --> 30:02.801
- No.
Who would believe me?

30:04.193 --> 30:06.935
- I do.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.329
After ten minutes
in this room,

30:09.372 --> 30:11.635
I know

30:11.679 --> 30:16.815
that he did something
horrific to you.

30:21.776 --> 30:24.344
When did this happen?

30:24.387 --> 30:27.347
- Five years ago.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.697
I pray and I pray
to the Virgin,

30:29.740 --> 30:31.960
asking her to let me die.

30:32.004 --> 30:34.745
- I--
I feel bad for you,

30:34.789 --> 30:37.270
I do, but it wasn't me--
- Shut up.

30:39.620 --> 30:40.882
Why do you believe her
and not me?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.666
She's a crazy person
with a gun--

30:42.710 --> 30:46.279
- I said shut up!

30:52.285 --> 30:53.764
- The first time

30:53.808 --> 30:55.201
you held me down
in the dirt,

30:55.244 --> 30:58.117
I picked up a piece of bottle.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.947
And I gripped it so hard,

31:01.990 --> 31:03.731
it got stuck
in the palm of my hand.

31:03.774 --> 31:06.081
Do you see?

31:06.125 --> 31:08.344
I kept it,
and every time you raped me,

31:08.388 --> 31:11.391
I clenched it
as hard as I could.

31:11.434 --> 31:14.785
By the third time,
the fourth time,

31:14.829 --> 31:16.918
I couldn't feel
the glass anymore.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.094
I couldn't feel anything
anymore.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.618
- I want you to feel

31:21.662 --> 31:23.403
what it's like
to be dead inside!

31:23.446 --> 31:26.928
- You're not dead inside.
Look at me.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.669
The numbness,
the emptiness,

31:28.712 --> 31:32.238
I know what that feels like,
and that's not you.

31:32.281 --> 31:35.676
I can help you
move past this.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.939
Honey, tell me your name.
- It doesn't matter.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.680
- It does matter!

31:39.723 --> 31:43.118
You matter to me.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.642
Tell me your name.

31:45.686 --> 31:48.341
- Lourdes.
- Lourdes, this--

31:48.384 --> 31:50.909
this isn't gonna
make you whole.

31:50.952 --> 31:54.260
This isn't gonna
get you justice.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.001
Listen to me.

31:56.044 --> 31:58.046
Are you sure

31:58.090 --> 32:01.920
that this is him?

32:01.963 --> 32:04.313
- It's him.
It's him.

32:04.357 --> 32:07.360
Watch, watch--
Miguel, Miguel--

32:07.403 --> 32:10.972
Sing for us your song,
your favorite song!

32:11.016 --> 32:12.365
- I don't--
I don't know--

32:12.408 --> 32:14.410
- Miguel, you sang it
every time

32:14.454 --> 32:16.456
you climbed on top of me!
- I don't know!

32:16.499 --> 32:18.980
- ♪ Para bailar la bamba

32:19.024 --> 32:21.461
♪ Para bailar la bamba

32:23.506 --> 32:25.900
Sing or I shoot,
I will shoot!

32:25.944 --> 32:27.902

32:27.946 --> 32:29.382

32:35.040 --> 32:36.737
Tell her, Mi--

32:36.780 --> 32:39.348
- You said that you wanted me
to bear witness.

32:39.392 --> 32:41.307
You said you wanted me
to watch,

32:41.350 --> 32:42.743
and I want what you want.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.353
I want what you want.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.268
And the only way
for you to feel whole,

32:46.312 --> 32:50.446
the only way
for the emptiness to go away,

32:50.490 --> 32:52.492

from his mouth.

32:52.535 --> 32:53.972
You're gonna tell her

32:54.015 --> 32:57.323
exactly what you did
to her.

32:57.366 --> 33:00.195
Do you understand me?

- Thank you.
- I just want

33:10.423 --> 33:14.035

Confess,

isn't answering his radio.

33:40.279 --> 33:42.455
He was with your lieutenant.

33:42.498 --> 33:44.413

33:44.457 --> 33:47.503
Liv, can you hear me?

Okay?
It's in my back pocket.

34:04.259 --> 34:10.135
It's okay.
Quick.

34:10.178 --> 34:13.442

34:15.140 --> 34:16.924
Yeah.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.231
Yeah,
everything's okay, um--

I have a few more
apartments to go.

All good.
Oh, uh--

I'm gonna need you

34:28.370 --> 34:29.458
to ask Rollins

34:29.502 --> 34:32.244
to pick up Jenny
from school.

34:32.287 --> 34:35.856

Yep, great.

The first time--

Keep going.

if I can refresh your memory.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.591
Think, Miguel.

35:15.635 --> 35:18.333
Think.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.727
When I started kicking

35:20.770 --> 35:22.381
and punching,

35:22.424 --> 35:24.818
what did you do?

35:24.861 --> 35:26.472

35:26.515 --> 35:28.517

- I burned you!

35:33.783 --> 35:36.438
- Stop!

to miss any

of the good parts.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.629
What else?

35:53.673 --> 35:56.850
- I held you down
in the dirt.

35:56.893 --> 35:59.113
And I raped you.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.031
- Now that

36:04.074 --> 36:08.688
sounds like a confession.

36:08.731 --> 36:13.040
I am your witness,
Lourdes.

36:13.083 --> 36:16.043
Just like you wanted.

36:16.086 --> 36:18.785
I heard that.

36:18.828 --> 36:22.136
I believe that.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.443
And I'm going
to arrest you.

36:24.486 --> 36:28.882
And I'm going
to testify against you.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.846
- Untie him.

36:36.890 --> 36:41.373
- You are doing
the right thing.

36:57.998 --> 37:00.783
Oh, God...

37:06.572 --> 37:08.008
- Stand up.

37:08.051 --> 37:11.620
Both of you.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.143
- Get up.

37:13.187 --> 37:15.407
- To the terrace.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.759
Look at that.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.195
Who would ever think
to put such a beautiful park

37:21.239 --> 37:23.153
in the middle
of such a filthy city?

37:23.197 --> 37:26.069
I like to bring the kids here
in the afternoons.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.723
Harry likes to climb

37:27.767 --> 37:30.857
the "Alice in Wonderland"
statue.

37:32.511 --> 37:35.557
Move.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.171
Turn around.

37:41.215 --> 37:44.436
Turn around!

37:46.960 --> 37:48.657
We tried to run,

37:48.701 --> 37:52.618
me and Estella
and Lucita!

37:52.661 --> 37:55.055
But he hunted us down
like dogs.

37:55.098 --> 37:58.493
He pointed his rifle at us
and he said,

37:58.537 --> 37:59.929
"One of you must die

37:59.973 --> 38:04.194
to teach the others
not to run."

38:04.238 --> 38:07.197
He said I should
be the one to pick

38:07.241 --> 38:11.550
which one of my friends
he should kill.

38:11.593 --> 38:14.422
I couldn't choose.

38:14.466 --> 38:17.251
I couldn't choose.
They were just people.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.688
They were people looking
for a better life!

38:19.732 --> 38:21.908
I couldn't choose!

38:21.951 --> 38:24.606
So he killed them both.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.784
"Plenty more
where they came from," he said.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.574
- Get up on the ledge.

38:35.617 --> 38:36.879
- Lourdes--
- Get up!

38:36.923 --> 38:41.014
- Lourdes, no!

38:41.057 --> 38:42.798
- Now I give you the choice.

38:42.842 --> 38:44.278
Either you jump

38:44.322 --> 38:47.629
or I shoot you in the head!

38:50.197 --> 38:52.634
- You cannot kill him, Lourdes.

38:52.678 --> 38:54.680
Because if you do,

38:54.723 --> 38:56.072
he becomes the victim.

38:56.116 --> 38:59.162
And then nobody will know,

38:59.206 --> 39:01.251
let alone believe,

39:01.295 --> 39:02.775
what happened to you.

39:02.818 --> 39:04.124
I promise you.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.866
He will spend
the rest of his life

39:06.909 --> 39:08.911
in prison.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.957
- Choose!
- Please!

39:11.000 --> 39:13.220
- What'll it be,
you bastard?

39:13.263 --> 39:14.917
Either a bullet
in the brain

39:14.961 --> 39:17.180
or a puddle of blood
on the sidewalk!

39:17.224 --> 39:18.791
- Lourdes,
put down the gun.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.575
- Choose!

39:20.619 --> 39:22.664
- Please, I'll f--
I'm sorry I hurt you!

39:22.708 --> 39:24.231
Please!

39:24.274 --> 39:27.234
Please don't kill me!

39:29.236 --> 39:31.586
- No, you're not
gonna kill him.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.022
You're not gonna kill him,

39:33.066 --> 39:36.635
because whatever it was
inside of you

39:36.678 --> 39:39.115
that wouldn't let you choose

39:39.159 --> 39:43.032
Estella or Lucita

39:43.076 --> 39:45.644
is still in you.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.733
And no one--

39:47.776 --> 39:51.911
No one can take that
away from you.

39:51.954 --> 39:54.087
Give me the gun.

39:54.130 --> 39:57.786
Give me the gun.

40:12.888 --> 40:15.674

Both.

Take this.
