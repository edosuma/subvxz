18:11.624 --> 18:14.125
And then I'll even throw in
hattie b's for lunch.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.426
How's that sound?

18:15.428 --> 18:18.196
Sure.
I will go get ready.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.603
[ cellphone ringing ]

18:27.707 --> 18:30.441
Hey.
Tandy: Where are you?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.977
And please don't tell me
that you're at the office,

18:32.979 --> 18:33.778
Because
I already checked there.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.980
Rayna, what is going on?

18:35.982 --> 18:38.416
Um...A lot.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.751
Remember what that judge said
about interfering,

18:40.753 --> 18:42.920
And cash has that
restraining order against you.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.656
There is no way any judge
or anybody else

18:45.658 --> 18:47.792
Is gonna keep me from
taking care of my daughter.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.960
That's how this
is gonna go.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.628
Don't worry about me, hon.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.063
I'll -- I'll -- I'll call
you back in a little bit.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.831
Bye.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.307
¶¶

19:07.147 --> 19:09.347
Maddie.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.648
Glenn, you're here!

19:10.650 --> 19:11.949
Of course I'm here.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.151
It's a very big day, kiddo.

19:13.153 --> 19:13.951
I know.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.753
I'm sorry.
I'm confused.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.588
I didn't see your name
on the invite list.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.956
Oh, no, no, no.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.124
Um, juliette loaned me him
for the day.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.659
She calls glenn
her good-luck charm,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.961
And I figured we could use
all the help we can get, right?

19:23.963 --> 19:27.498
Right, well,
that's why we hired ty here.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.600
Ty's one of the best
entertainment lawyers in town.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.668
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.802
You're welcome.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.504
Now, lawyers and managers

19:33.506 --> 19:34.772
Are two very different things

19:34.774 --> 19:37.041
With two very different areas
of expertise.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.309
Isn't that right, ty?

19:38.311 --> 19:40.178
Actually, yes,
I would have to agree.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.647
And since maddie here
doesn't have a manager yet,

19:42.649 --> 19:45.383
I thought my insight and
experience would be helpful.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.519
And since my services are free,
can't beat the price.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.121

19:50.123 --> 19:53.257
Well, welcome aboard.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.133

20:03.336 --> 20:04.735
Deacon: I ain't here
to fight, frankie.

20:04.737 --> 20:08.172
I'm here to apologize
face to face.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.041
Now, look,
me and you both know

20:10.043 --> 20:11.475
Exactly what happened
out back, right?

20:11.477 --> 20:13.978
But I should not have
come here that night,

20:13.980 --> 20:15.646
And I shouldn't have said
those things about cash, either.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.215
I know
you're just a father

20:17.217 --> 20:19.183
Trying to stay in a relationship
with his daughter, protect her.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.085
God knows I get that.

20:21.087 --> 20:25.022
Look,
we're partners, right?

20:25.024 --> 20:26.390
What the hell
we gonna do?

20:26.392 --> 20:27.825
Draw a line right
down the middle of the beverly?

20:27.827 --> 20:30.328
Drawing a line wouldn't work.
You'd just keep crossing it.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.363
Frankie, we fought before, man,
all right?

20:32.365 --> 20:33.698
We always find our way back.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.000
Not this time.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.035
This was my bar.
[ sighs ]

20:38.037 --> 20:39.737
Before all the fancy pews
and the curtains

20:39.739 --> 20:42.540
And all your famous
damn friends, it was my bar.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.609
Frankie, we built
the beverly together, man.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.711
You were here
every single --
it's not the beverly anymore.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.246
What are you talking about?

20:48.248 --> 20:50.047
I'm buying your ass out.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.949
My attorneys
are drawing up the papers,

20:51.951 --> 20:53.217
And I suggest you sign them,

20:53.219 --> 20:55.186
'cause if you don't,
I'm taking you to civil court

20:55.188 --> 20:57.021
And sue you
for everything you got.

20:57.023 --> 21:01.425
That sign's coming down, deacon,
one way or the other.

21:01.427 --> 21:05.496
Now, get the hell out of here
before I call the cops.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.403
Well, I don't know.
What do you think?

21:12.405 --> 21:14.071
Maybe we go minor there.
That might help build the drama.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.473
No.
You expect it to go minor.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.941
You got to fight against the
drama until the bridge releases.

21:16.943 --> 21:21.045
Okay, geez,
have a snickers, marcia.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.247
[ grunts ]

21:23.249 --> 21:25.082
Okay, I'm sorry.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.551
That sounded, uh,
less angry in my head.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.220
Trust me,
it's -- it's not you.

21:29.222 --> 21:31.989
Let me guess. Scarlett.
[ sighs ]

21:31.991 --> 21:33.257
Now there's
this headphone commercial

21:33.259 --> 21:34.625
And they just want
to use her

21:34.627 --> 21:37.561
And -- and I know it shouldn't
bother me, but it does,

21:37.563 --> 21:39.096
And that makes me feel
like a jerk.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.599
I mean [sighs] it's good
for the band, right?

21:41.601 --> 21:42.800
I don't know about that.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.069
Sounds to me like
it's good for scarlett.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.004
Wasn't like
she went looking for it.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.140
It's just -- I can't really be
mad at her, can I?

21:49.142 --> 21:52.610
Gunnar,
it may not be her fault.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.179
That doesn't mean you don't have
the right to be upset.

21:55.181 --> 21:58.616
It sucks when your hard work
and your talent isn't rewarded.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.285
And as much as you like
to pretend otherwise,

22:01.287 --> 22:04.188
You are the driving force
behind the exes.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.691
It was your creation
to start with.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.025
Well, yeah, but --

22:08.027 --> 22:09.527
Stop letting other people
take credit.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.595
You are
an amazing talent.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.998

a good two miles

behind me.

I finally wheeled around on her
and asked her

22:30.183 --> 22:32.383
What in the world
she was doing.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.318
Now, she was a head smaller,

right in the eye.

I'm coming, too..."

was more than a sister.

is gone from my life,

that she's in a better place.

I owe you an apology.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.714
Yes, I overreacted.

24:10.716 --> 24:15.085
But it's not because I'm
embarrassed to be seen with you.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.455
It could've been anyone
in those pictures with me,

24:17.457 --> 24:19.957
And I would've reacted
the exact same way.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.426
The problem is the fact that
there were pictures at all.

I've been one half
of a celebrity couple before.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.398

that comes with it.

anonymous sometimes?

has a camera these days.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.950
Yeah, it sucks,

24:45.952 --> 24:48.252
But maybe it would suck
a little less if we
were in it together.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.959
I just hope they don't give us
a cute little nickname,

24:54.961 --> 24:56.794
Because I-I really hate that.
Are you kidding?

24:56.796 --> 24:58.195

Hey.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.366
I want to tell you a story.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.402
It's about two sisters,

26:11.404 --> 26:13.103
And they were as close
as could be --

26:13.105 --> 26:14.605
Best friends since birth.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.907
And then one of the sisters
got really angry

26:16.909 --> 26:18.842
With one of the parents

26:18.844 --> 26:20.344
And they fought
and they fought,

26:20.346 --> 26:23.514
And then one day...
She was gone.

26:23.516 --> 26:26.750
And the sister
who got left behind, she --

26:26.752 --> 26:28.552
Wow,
she cried and she begged,

26:28.554 --> 26:30.421
And there was nothing
that she could say

26:30.423 --> 26:32.890
That could change
her sister's mind.

26:32.892 --> 26:35.025
She wanted to be free.

26:35.027 --> 26:39.096
She wanted to go out there
and sing.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.965
Rayna

26:42.802 --> 26:45.369
And as devastated
as I was,

26:45.371 --> 26:47.805
I think
that it was harder for daddy.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.774
So I decided that I was gonna be
the good daughter,

26:50.776 --> 26:55.613
The strong one, and I was never
gonna let him see me cry.

26:55.615 --> 26:59.149
But I really wanted
to cry every day.

27:01.787 --> 27:05.055

all the time,

27:05.057 --> 27:09.460

about right now is maddie.

but it's not true.

That you're about to see,

27:28.614 --> 27:31.115
But it has been
nearly impossible.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.349
I mean, nowadays,

27:32.351 --> 27:35.519
Everyone uses so much hyperbole
about everything

27:35.521 --> 27:39.256
That words like "amazing"
and "incredible"

27:39.258 --> 27:40.958
Have absolutely no meaning
to them anymore.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.994

that the best way

27:43.996 --> 27:45.362

Is to just let you

28:17.196 --> 28:18.562
I meant legally.

28:18.564 --> 28:22.066
Mm. And yet suddenly
she's using my last name.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.801
Wonder whose idea
that was.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.336
You know, are you really gonna
make me call the cops right now?

28:26.338 --> 28:27.871
No, I don't think
that's gonna be necessary.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.139
I've seen all I need
to see here.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.542
Just want you to know
I got my eye on you.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.378

so hard ¶

28:59.371 --> 29:01.004
Care to dance?

29:02.842 --> 29:05.442
I don't think your date would
appreciate that very much.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.579
Kesha?
No, we're just friends.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.048
Looked like pretty friendly
friends to me.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.716
No, she's just doing me
a favor.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.685
I was supposed to be shooting
up in vancouver today,

29:14.687 --> 29:16.587
But there was a last-minute
change in the schedule,

29:16.589 --> 29:19.223
So I decided to fly down here
with an hour to spare

29:19.225 --> 29:20.924
And figured only a friend
would be okay

29:20.926 --> 29:22.292
With a last-minute invite.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.428
Well, at least you had
a friend.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.764
My choices were
my assistant or my manager.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.465
Option number three --

29:28.467 --> 29:31.201
A complete stranger
set up by my publicist.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.903
I find that hard to believe

29:32.905 --> 29:34.905
That juliette barnes
needs help finding a date.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.740
Come on.
You know how people are.

29:36.742 --> 29:39.576
They want to date the celebrity,
not the person.

29:39.578 --> 29:40.744
Which used
to not bother me,

29:40.746 --> 29:42.446
But of course
now I'm a mom,

29:42.448 --> 29:46.216
Which men don't seem to find
sexy for some reason.

29:46.218 --> 29:49.820
You never answered
my question.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.288
What question?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.623
Will you dance with me?

29:58.731 --> 30:00.664
The metrics just came in.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.266
You're definitely getting fewer
spins than you did a week ago,

30:02.268 --> 30:03.600
And some radio group
out west

30:03.602 --> 30:05.235
Just stopped playing you
altogether.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.738
You have to stop fighting
will's battle for him, luke.

30:07.740 --> 30:10.741
He needs more time, especially
with his mom just dying.

30:10.743 --> 30:12.442
I'm not talking about getting
will into the ring.

30:12.444 --> 30:13.577
It's too late for that.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.979
He is taking you down
with him, luke.

30:15.981 --> 30:16.947
You have to cut him loose.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.950
[ clears throat ]

30:19.952 --> 30:22.019
I'm on the right side
of history here,

30:22.021 --> 30:25.789
And the only thing I hate more
than a bigot is a coward.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.691
So, yeah, it is time
to cut somebody loose,

30:27.693 --> 30:30.160
But it ain't will.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.995
Goodbye, ken.

30:41.841 --> 30:45.709
[ exhales slowly ]

30:45.711 --> 30:47.644
Sorry you found out
the way you did.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.516
Should've called you
myself.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.683
I want to thank you, too,
for not making a big
scene up there today.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.786
Appreciate
you being respectful.

30:55.788 --> 31:00.190
You throw me
out of the house, disown me,

31:00.192 --> 31:04.194
Don't even have the decency
to tell me my own mother died,

31:04.196 --> 31:06.063
And you talk to me
about respect?

31:06.065 --> 31:07.998
Don't pretend
you're some victim here.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.300
If it weren't for you, none of
that would've ever happened.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.970
Well, if it weren't for you,
I would've never been born.

31:12.972 --> 31:16.740
I am what you made me, dad.
I'm your son.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.075
Not the son we wanted.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.676
Do not speak for her.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.311
You never knew
what mom wanted,

31:21.313 --> 31:22.846
Because you never took
the time to ask.

31:22.848 --> 31:25.515
We had a belief system.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.050
That doesn't mean
you couldn't love me.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.986
Mom did.

31:28.988 --> 31:32.222
I know she did, even if she had
to hide it from you.

31:33.826 --> 31:35.659
So maybe she died
of a broken heart,

31:35.661 --> 31:37.494
But that's on you,
not me.

31:39.698 --> 31:43.100
Because you're the one
who threw away her son.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.104
[ cheers and applause ]
autumn: All right, listen up.

31:47.106 --> 31:50.340
As a songwriter,
you can always tell

31:50.342 --> 31:53.610
When you are stuck on a lyric.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.746
I was recently, but then it
occurred to me I've actually got

31:55.748 --> 31:58.615
A cma award-winning songwriter
on tour with me.
Can I talk to you
for a second?

31:58.617 --> 32:00.584
Look, scarlett, if you want to
do the commercial, that's fine.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.185
It's not about
the commercial.

32:02.187 --> 32:03.887
I really think

Mr. Gunnar scott,

32:10.362 --> 32:13.463
Would you like to come on out
on stage with me

32:13.465 --> 32:15.299
And give our new song a spin?

32:15.301 --> 32:16.600
Uh...

32:16.602 --> 32:18.568
You been -- you been writing
with autumn?

32:18.570 --> 32:20.604
Yeah, it was just one song...
Gunnar, come on! Don't be shy!

32:20.606 --> 32:22.039
...But I had no idea
she was gonna do this.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.074
Get your butt out here!

32:24.076 --> 32:25.275
Well, you better
get out there.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.310
You got to keep the boss happy,
right?

Glad you came.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.156
[ door closes ]

33:13.158 --> 33:16.760
Okay. So we have
some real solid interest here.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.595
Let's cut to it.
Who seems most interested?

33:18.597 --> 33:19.663
Tupelo creek.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.765
Doug weaver wants
a meeting a.S.A.P.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.500
Tupelo creek's
a great label,

33:23.502 --> 33:24.968
And it's a good fit
for maddie --

33:24.970 --> 33:26.703
Big enough to handle
major clients

33:26.705 --> 33:28.672
Yet small enough to give a new
artist plenty of attention.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.708
And they got a nice, honest
reputation around town, too.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.377
Wait a minute, though.

33:33.379 --> 33:34.778
What glenn isn't telling you

33:34.780 --> 33:37.180
Is that doug weaver started
as an a&r guy at edgehill

33:37.182 --> 33:39.683
And was there the entire time
that rayna was on that label.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.718
For all we know,
they could still be tight.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.286
Mm.
[ chuckling ] so what?

33:43.288 --> 33:45.122
You're gonna ding
tupelo creek for that?

33:45.124 --> 33:46.790
Rayna knows a lot of people
in this town.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.960
Exactly, which is why we need to
leave nashville altogether.

33:49.962 --> 33:51.795
Wait. What?
You can't be serious.

33:51.797 --> 33:52.996
What about lennox hill?

33:52.998 --> 33:54.865
They're interested, too --
very --

33:54.867 --> 33:56.066
But they're in new york.
That's great.

33:56.068 --> 33:57.834
Zero ties to nashville.

33:57.836 --> 33:58.902
Which means
rayna won't be able

33:58.904 --> 34:00.370
To call up her cronies
and interfere.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.639
Maddie has just been
through a major upheaval.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.641
Are you really that paranoid
that you would remove her

34:04.643 --> 34:06.910
From her support system,
from her home?

34:06.912 --> 34:09.146
Okay, look,
you wanted to emancipate,

34:09.148 --> 34:10.814
And I am telling you
that the only way to do that

34:10.816 --> 34:12.649
Is to make a clean break.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.920
But even though I'm shaky,

34:16.922 --> 34:18.922
I know if I can
just hang in there,

34:18.924 --> 34:21.525
Stay strong,

Why do we keep saying that?
E-excuse me?

34:26.098 --> 34:28.031
"things are gonna get better."
why do we say that?

34:28.033 --> 34:30.400
I mean, everybody in this room
said that -- none more than me.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.537
I mean, that's why we get sober
so things will get better,

34:33.539 --> 34:38.175

my daughter...

37:59.044 --> 38:00.777
[ chuckling ]
I know. Isn't it?

38:00.779 --> 38:03.046
And the funny thing is,
since the photos have appeared,

38:03.048 --> 38:04.981
I'm starting to get
these interview requests.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.883
Suddenly people
are interested again.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.485
Well, that's great news.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.487
I mean, I guess something good
came out of all this, then.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.721
Yeah.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.024
It's almost like
we planned it.

38:16.995 --> 38:19.663
Good night, glenn.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.131
[ cellphone beeps ]

38:29.675 --> 38:32.008
Well, we already made
the magazines.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.312
Oh, yeah?
Let's have a look.

38:35.314 --> 38:38.248
Hey, we look pretty good
together.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.783
[ chuckles ]

38:39.785 --> 38:41.818
Should we put out
a strongly worded denial?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.486
We're gonna get calls.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.021
Yeah, we could do that,

38:45.023 --> 38:48.658
Or we could just say,
"hell yes,"

38:48.660 --> 38:50.527
Put a lot of exclamation points
next to it.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.829
Are you saying
you want this to be a thing?

38:52.831 --> 38:54.597
Yeah, why not?

38:54.599 --> 38:57.801
I mean, we're both available,
last night was amazing,

38:57.803 --> 38:59.169
And I don't know about you,

38:59.171 --> 39:01.538
But I would love to see
where this goes.

39:03.342 --> 39:07.210
Or we could just put out
a strongly worded denial.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.378
[ chuckles ]

39:08.380 --> 39:10.113
No, no.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.381
I just...

39:13.618 --> 39:15.719
I'm just surprised.
That's all.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.680
Hey.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.382
All right,
you got a choice --

39:45.384 --> 39:48.752
Bananas, strawberry,
chocolate chip, or blueberry.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.854
You're making pancakes?
Yes.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.322
Unless you want
chocolate-chip eggs,

39:52.324 --> 39:53.990
'cause you know
I will do it.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.460
Hey.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.398
[ sighs ]

40:01.400 --> 40:04.501
Man, it's been tough
around here, hasn't it?

40:04.503 --> 40:06.536
And you've been so strong.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.171
But you don't have to be
strong for me.

40:08.173 --> 40:10.173
You don't have to be strong
for anybody.

40:10.175 --> 40:13.209
If you feel like crying
or screaming

40:13.211 --> 40:18.848
Or breaking something,
you just let me know.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.383
Shoot, maybe I'll do it
with you.

40:20.385 --> 40:24.087
I just -- I hate seeing you
this sad all the time.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.622
I know.
I'm sorry about that.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.224
I promise
I won't be sad forever.

40:28.226 --> 40:31.594
It's just gonna take
a little bit of time,

40:31.596 --> 40:32.962
But we're gonna
get through this.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.631
We all will.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.267
Deacon, too?

40:37.269 --> 40:39.602
Yeah, deacon, too.

40:40.639 --> 40:44.007
We just have to find our footing
without maddie here.

40:45.143 --> 40:46.576
I hate her.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.111
No.
Honey, don't say that.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.979
You love her so much.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.748
That's why it hurts so bad.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.317
And I know you're angry at the
choices she's making right now,

40:54.319 --> 40:57.320
But don't confuse anger
with hate.

40:57.322 --> 41:01.024
We can still love somebody
even when we're angry at them.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.828
Why don't you head on up,
get yourself dressed?

41:04.830 --> 41:06.963
I'll get
these pancakes made.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.965
Deal?
Deal.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.900
And I will take blueberry.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.002
Good choice.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.005
I love you, mom.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.674
I love you, too.
