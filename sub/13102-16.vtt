00:03.667 --> 00:06.167
[instrumental music]

00:33.500 --> 00:35.750
Delenn, are you alright?

00:38.167 --> 00:41.708
You should sleep.
It'll be morning soon.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.375
You'll need all your strength
for what's ahead.

00:44.458 --> 00:46.917
[music continues]

00:52.000 --> 00:53.542
[sighs]

01:14.417 --> 01:16.500
[music continues]

01:34.083 --> 01:35.625
It's, uh..

01:37.250 --> 01:39.167
It's all yours.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.583
[sighs]

02:09.375 --> 02:12.958
(Sheridan)
There comes a moment
in everyone's life

02:13.042 --> 02:17.042
when you have to do something
you'd rather not do.

02:17.125 --> 02:21.208
When you know something
you'd rather not know.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.333
This is one such moment.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.875
I understand there is
a council meeting in progress.

02:31.958 --> 02:34.417
That's correct, but I can't
let you in, ambassador.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.875
It's a closed session.

02:35.958 --> 02:38.167
I would remind you that
I am on the advisory board

02:38.250 --> 02:39.375
for the Alliance.

02:39.458 --> 02:41.583
I have every right
to be in there.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.458
Well, that's not
my decision to make.

02:44.542 --> 02:47.375
When they're ready to see you,
they'll send for you.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.083
Every right
in the world to be in there!

02:51.167 --> 02:53.958
- 'Londo.'
- Are they selling me out, hmm?

02:54.042 --> 02:56.750
Selling out my people,
Mr. Allan, without giving me

02:56.833 --> 03:00.000
a chance to defend myself
to rebut the evidence?

03:00.083 --> 03:03.750
This is wrong.
This is unfair.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.917
And I should be in there.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.375
Londo, don't do this.
You'll only make things worse.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.708
Worse, Mr. Allan?

03:16.792 --> 03:19.333
Worse than what?

03:19.417 --> 03:23.583
(Delenn)
So it is with great difficulty
and tremendous personal pain

03:23.667 --> 03:25.750
that we stand before you now.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.667
For the last six months,
all of you have suffered

03:28.750 --> 03:31.583
devastating attacks
on your shipping lines.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.625
Lives have been lost,
ships and cargo destroyed

03:34.708 --> 03:37.875
at a cost of hundreds
of millions of credits.

03:37.958 --> 03:41.083
The cost in pain to those
who lost family and friends

03:41.167 --> 03:43.958
in those attacks
can never be measured.

03:44.042 --> 03:46.167
Shortly after
these attacks started

03:46.250 --> 03:51.083
we began an investigation
to find out who was responsible.

03:51.167 --> 03:55.250
Now in exchange for your
patience and cooperation

03:55.333 --> 03:57.292
we gave you our word

03:57.375 --> 03:59.458
that as soon as we found
conclusive evidence

03:59.542 --> 04:03.333
we would bring it before you
and pursue it fully

04:03.417 --> 04:05.292
no matter where it led.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.792
In a moment,
we will show you proof

04:07.875 --> 04:11.458
that the Centauri Republic is
responsible for these attacks.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.375
[indistinct murmuring]

04:14.833 --> 04:19.417
We promised that the Alliance
would support any action

04:19.500 --> 04:21.875
that you,
the member worlds, decided

04:21.958 --> 04:24.125
should be taken
against those responsible.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.917
Now that we know
that it is the Centauri..

04:29.542 --> 04:31.667
...that promise..

04:31.750 --> 04:34.500
...weighs heavily on us.

04:36.208 --> 04:40.375
But we have an obligation
to honor that promise.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.208
And we will..

04:43.625 --> 04:45.833
...no matter the cost.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.875
- There is a hole in your mind.
- What do you want?

04:56.958 --> 04:59.333
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

04:59.417 --> 05:01.208
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

05:01.292 --> 05:03.375
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.458
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld?

05:05.542 --> 05:08.042
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of a star.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.500
(Sebastian)
Who are you?

05:09.583 --> 05:10.667
(female #1)
President Clark has signed

05:10.750 --> 05:12.708
a decree today declaring..

05:12.792 --> 05:14.542
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.208
I've seen people
get off their encounter

05:16.292 --> 05:17.792
suited butts and do something.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.500
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

05:19.583 --> 05:21.917
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'Ha'Dum,
you will die.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.417
(Lorein)
Why are you here?

05:23.500 --> 05:25.292
Do you have anything
worth living for?

05:25.375 --> 05:27.458
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

05:27.542 --> 05:28.917
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.083
Now get the hell
out of our galaxy.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.167
We are here to place

05:31.250 --> 05:32.917
President Clark under arrest.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.208
[theme music]

06:03.000 --> 06:05.500
[music continues]

06:23.708 --> 06:26.167
[instrumental music]

06:36.125 --> 06:40.167
(Delenn)
We will begin our testimonies
with Dr. Stephen Franklin.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.542
All of the high-energy weapons
used by the members

06:42.625 --> 06:44.792
of the Alliance share
certain characteristics

06:44.875 --> 06:46.667
due to the physics involved.

06:46.750 --> 06:50.417
But they also have
certain differences as well.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.708
For instance, uh,
most of your fleets

06:52.792 --> 06:54.833
are built at shipyards
based on your homeworlds

06:54.917 --> 06:57.125
for reasons of security.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.833
Now these shipyards use
locally produced material

06:59.917 --> 07:01.125
to build a focusing lens

07:01.208 --> 07:03.833
the central part
of any energy weapon.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.167
The unique characteristics
of this material

07:06.250 --> 07:09.500
can subtly alter the spectrum
of light used in the beams

07:09.583 --> 07:12.833
making them individual
to each world.

07:12.917 --> 07:15.833
Can you tell us a little bit
about how you identify

07:15.917 --> 07:17.833
these unique differences?

07:17.917 --> 07:20.625
These energy fingerprints?

07:20.708 --> 07:23.625
Well, we arranged to have
one or two random bodies

07:23.708 --> 07:25.500
sent to us after each attack.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.917
'A complete autopsy
was conducted on those bodies'

07:28.000 --> 07:31.250
'in order to determine
what kind of weapons were used.'

07:31.333 --> 07:34.250
Can you explain the process?

07:34.333 --> 07:36.542
Excessive light
bleaches out the skin

07:36.625 --> 07:38.667
where it comes
in contact with it.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.208
It does the same
to the rods and cones

07:40.292 --> 07:41.625
in the back of the eyes

07:41.708 --> 07:45.875
used to sense
light, dark, colors.

07:45.958 --> 07:48.708
It takes a moment for these
rods and cones to recover

07:48.792 --> 07:50.625
from these bright colors.

07:50.708 --> 07:53.208
That's why you'll see a,
uh, green dot

07:53.292 --> 07:56.000
when you blink
after looking at a red light

07:56.083 --> 08:00.042
or a, uh, yellow dot after
looking at a bright blue object.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.042
It's always the exact opposite
of the original spectrum

08:03.125 --> 08:05.250
and it is
surprisingly precise.

08:06.292 --> 08:07.917
Because the subject dies
within seconds

08:08.000 --> 08:10.125
of being hit by
a high-energy weapon

08:10.208 --> 08:12.458
the rods and cones
never recover.

08:12.542 --> 08:15.292
By analyzing their condition and
the state of the bleached skin

08:15.375 --> 08:17.417
we're able to determine
the frequency of the spectrum

08:17.500 --> 08:18.875
used in the weapons.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.708
And is that spectrum

08:20.792 --> 08:23.208
consistent
with Centauri weaponry?

08:23.292 --> 08:24.750
It is.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.917
In addition, the Centauri
use their weapons

08:27.000 --> 08:28.917
almost like projectiles.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.750
Exploding rather than slicing
or disrupting their targets.

08:32.833 --> 08:35.417
All the bodies
had explosive tissue burns

08:35.500 --> 08:38.250
consistent to Centauri
high-energy weapons.

08:40.333 --> 08:43.292
(Delenn)
Our next segment
is from Mr. Michael Garibaldi

08:43.375 --> 08:46.625
head of intelligence
for the Alliance.

08:46.708 --> 08:48.417
(Garibaldi)
As Dr. Franklin
mentioned earlier

08:48.500 --> 08:50.417
Centauri weapons
are designed to be used

08:50.500 --> 08:52.583
in an explosive
rather than a slicing mode.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.333
Analysis of the debris confirms

08:54.417 --> 08:56.542
that the energy weapons
were used in that way.

08:56.625 --> 08:59.167
In addition, the tactics used
to ambush the cargo ships

08:59.250 --> 09:01.542
are consistent with
Centauri training maneuvers.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.125
That last part
can be considered subjective.

09:05.208 --> 09:07.208
Do you have anything
more objective

09:07.292 --> 09:09.083
that points to the Centauri?

09:09.167 --> 09:10.417
I do.

09:11.708 --> 09:13.208
This came from one
of several individuals

09:13.292 --> 09:15.583
on the Drazi homeworld
who ambushed me

09:15.667 --> 09:19.000
and killed the only surviving
witness to one of these attacks.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.292
It has been identified
as belonging to the uniform

09:21.375 --> 09:23.542
of the Centauri palace guards.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.833
I must also mention that
my ambush was a direct result

09:26.917 --> 09:28.625
of a leak of information
about my mission

09:28.708 --> 09:30.208
to the Drazi homeworld.

09:30.292 --> 09:32.000
This came shortly
after Ambassador Mollari

09:32.083 --> 09:34.958
was informed of our plans
at a regular briefing session.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.875
After my return, we decided
to keep Mollari out of the loop

09:37.958 --> 09:41.000
and since then, there have
been no further leaks.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.292
Is it true
that in the last three months

09:43.375 --> 09:46.333
only one Centauri vessel
has been attacked?

09:46.417 --> 09:47.333
That's correct.

09:47.417 --> 09:48.833
It was an aging cargo ship

09:48.917 --> 09:51.042
that was due to be scrapped
and sold for parts.

09:51.125 --> 09:53.042
We found no cargo
of any significance

09:53.125 --> 09:54.833
and we did not find any bodies.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.292
We can only conclude from that

09:56.375 --> 09:58.208
that it was put there
to throw us off the track

09:58.292 --> 10:00.167
and to make us think
that there was an attack

10:00.250 --> 10:02.375
against the Centauri
shipping lines.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.292
[doorbell chimes]

10:04.375 --> 10:05.875
Open.

10:08.583 --> 10:11.167
- Hello, G'Kar.
- Mollari.

10:11.250 --> 10:14.333
Have you come here to drop off
your evidence as well?

10:14.417 --> 10:17.833
On your way to tell them
all the things you saw and heard

10:17.917 --> 10:21.667
while you were pretending to be
my bodyguard on Centauri Prime?

10:21.750 --> 10:23.667
I was not pretending.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.667
I went to Centauri Prime
as your guest

10:26.750 --> 10:29.583
your protector,
perhaps even your conscience

10:29.667 --> 10:32.208
but not as anyone's
eyes and ears.

10:32.292 --> 10:36.625
So no, I will not be testifying
before the council.

10:38.083 --> 10:40.250
But I was there, Mollari.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.458
I saw you concerned
about the increase

10:42.542 --> 10:44.375
in preparations for war.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.833
Concerned that the information
about the location

10:46.917 --> 10:48.792
and activities of your warships

10:48.875 --> 10:51.125
once freely available to you
and other ministers

10:51.208 --> 10:53.208
was suddenly classified.

10:53.292 --> 10:55.583
You knew something was going on.

10:55.667 --> 11:01.292
But I believe you never knew
the shape of it until now.

11:01.375 --> 11:04.042
Don't tell me
what you think I know.

11:06.042 --> 11:07.625
Still, uh

11:07.708 --> 11:11.542
I suppose I should thank you
for respecting my privacy.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.500
So if you're not here
to drop off your evidence

11:16.583 --> 11:18.708
why are you here?

11:18.792 --> 11:20.500
To tell you..

11:24.000 --> 11:26.750
...that they are ready
to see you now.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
I have had the opportunity
to review the evidence

11:34.083 --> 11:35.833
that has been brought
before you.

11:37.083 --> 11:41.542
At first, I was offended,
angry.

11:41.625 --> 11:45.500
And then, I did the only thing
that I could do.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.875
[indistinct murmuring]

11:49.167 --> 11:51.125
This is a joke.

11:53.875 --> 11:55.208
'Cruel, yes.'

11:55.292 --> 11:57.542
Insulting and destructive,
of course

11:57.625 --> 12:00.542
but a joke nonetheless.

12:00.625 --> 12:02.625
Circumstantial evidence.

12:02.708 --> 12:05.292
Half truths. Distortions.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.125
And enough unfounded assumptions

12:07.208 --> 12:10.083
to-to wrap around
the station three times

12:10.167 --> 12:12.292
and still leave room
for a knot.

12:12.375 --> 12:15.625
You cannot deny that the weapons
are of Centauri design.

12:15.708 --> 12:18.958
Yes, there are similarities,
but for years

12:19.042 --> 12:21.333
we have supplied weapons
to other worlds

12:21.417 --> 12:24.125
including some of you.

12:24.208 --> 12:25.667
Not only that.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.125
After we left Narn

12:27.208 --> 12:29.750
many of our weapons and ships
were left behind.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.708
The Narn government
could use these resources

12:32.792 --> 12:36.000
to throw blame
on my government.

12:36.083 --> 12:39.333
You could take this information
and twist it

12:39.417 --> 12:41.958
to indict any one of you.

12:42.042 --> 12:43.500
There is not one shred

12:43.583 --> 12:47.125
of conclusive proof
anywhere here.

12:47.208 --> 12:50.375
Then you refute the charges
made against your government.

12:50.458 --> 12:54.500
As far as I am concerned,
there is nothing to refute.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.500
And I have nothing more
to say to any of you.

12:57.583 --> 13:01.708
Ambassador, there's one last
piece of evidence to consider.

13:01.792 --> 13:04.167
We wanted you to see it
at the same time we showed it

13:04.250 --> 13:06.583
to the rest of the council.

13:06.667 --> 13:07.875
Lennier.

13:10.167 --> 13:12.833
As part of
the continuing investigation

13:12.917 --> 13:14.542
I was assigned to a White Star

13:14.625 --> 13:17.542
patrolling the border
of Centauri space.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.417
During my assignment,
I intercepted

13:19.500 --> 13:22.542
several coded signals
of Centauri origin.

13:22.625 --> 13:23.875
I took out a fighter

13:23.958 --> 13:26.375
and I tracked the signal
to its location.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.333
This is what I found.

13:40.792 --> 13:42.542
The identification marks
on those warships

13:42.625 --> 13:44.542
do not correspond
with any of our records

13:44.625 --> 13:46.542
currently on file.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.667
My fighter was attached
to one of those warships

13:48.750 --> 13:50.750
when it jumped.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.208
This is what I encountered

13:52.292 --> 13:54.417
when we jumped back
into normal space.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.250
[gasps]

13:58.917 --> 14:01.417
[instrumental music]

14:11.708 --> 14:14.750
(man on radio)
'We surrender!
Please, we've done nothing!'

14:14.833 --> 14:16.417
'Take whatever you want,
but please'

14:16.500 --> 14:18.083
'we've got children on board.'

14:18.167 --> 14:19.292
'Don't you understand?'

14:19.375 --> 14:21.833
'We've got children on board!
We--'

14:34.333 --> 14:37.500
Any reactions, ambassador?

14:43.917 --> 14:45.292
No.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.708
Not until I speak
with my government.

14:47.792 --> 14:50.125
Well, when you do..

14:50.208 --> 14:52.875
...relay the following message
to them.

14:56.042 --> 14:57.625
The Centauri government

14:57.708 --> 15:00.917
has lashed out at its fellow
members of the Alliance

15:01.000 --> 15:04.042
in acts
of unjustified aggression.

15:05.042 --> 15:08.708
No, not aggression, terrorism.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.375
And there's only
one proper response.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.125
Effective immediately

15:13.208 --> 15:14.958
we will isolate
the Centauri Republic

15:15.042 --> 15:17.917
from the Company
of Alliance Worlds.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.500
(Delenn)
'Goods and supplies heading
to or from Centauri Prime'

15:21.583 --> 15:24.542
will be blocked at every
jumpgate and transfer point

15:24.625 --> 15:25.875
in the Alliance.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.500
Any Centauri vessel
entering or leaving

15:28.583 --> 15:32.000
will be stopped, boarded
and turned back.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.458
If they resist, they will
be fired upon and seized.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.042
A blockade?

15:38.125 --> 15:41.083
Which will continue until
such time as your government

15:41.167 --> 15:45.167
acknowledges and apologizes
for these attacks..

15:45.250 --> 15:47.208
...and provides reparations.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.917
As of right now

15:50.000 --> 15:53.375
the Centauri Republic
stands alone.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.000
What is taking them so long?

16:01.083 --> 16:03.375
They said they would get back
to me hours ago.

16:03.458 --> 16:04.958
Did you get them copies
of the evidence?

16:05.042 --> 16:06.292
Yes.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.208
And they understood there was
another council meeting

16:08.292 --> 16:10.167
in less than an hour, hmm?

16:10.250 --> 16:11.125
Yes.

16:11.208 --> 16:12.917
Then what is taking them
so long?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.042
I don't know.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.417
Maybe they didn't say anything

16:15.500 --> 16:17.542
because they know
the allegations are true.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.292
What are you talking about?

16:19.375 --> 16:20.750
If something like this
were going on

16:20.833 --> 16:22.417
I would know about it.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.208
Besides in 500 years

16:24.292 --> 16:26.375
the Centauri Republic
has never attacked

16:26.458 --> 16:27.875
a civilian target.

16:27.958 --> 16:29.958
Yes, but there were the Narns.

16:30.042 --> 16:32.542
(Londo)
'Those were wars
of aggression and occupation.'

16:32.625 --> 16:34.375
In war, these things happen.

16:34.458 --> 16:35.917
We are not at war.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.292
We do not strike first

16:37.375 --> 16:40.208
and we do not blow up
cargo transports

16:40.292 --> 16:42.833
like-like pirates or barbarians.

16:42.917 --> 16:45.333
How do you explain
the records then?

16:45.417 --> 16:47.000
Prime Minister Mollari.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.667
Ah, minister, good.
Did you see the regent?

16:49.750 --> 16:50.625
I did.

16:50.708 --> 16:51.792
He has finished going over

16:51.875 --> 16:53.667
the material you sent along.

16:53.750 --> 16:57.750
He pronounced it the most
clever fraud he'd ever seen.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.125
'I must concur.'

16:59.208 --> 17:02.917
We believe there are
two possible explanations.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.083
One, the material
is a deliberate forgery.

17:06.167 --> 17:08.417
No, no, no.
I can't accept that.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.958
I know Lennier.

17:10.042 --> 17:11.250
If he says he was there

17:11.333 --> 17:14.250
that he saw these things,
then he saw them.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.917
Which leaves option number two.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.042
That the entire incident
was staged for his benefit

17:19.125 --> 17:20.583
'using materials and ships'

17:20.667 --> 17:22.750
'we left behind
on the Narn homeworld.'

17:22.833 --> 17:25.333
We checked the inventory
of resources and--

17:25.417 --> 17:27.458
But there are so many ships
in the records.

17:27.542 --> 17:30.417
The-the Narns couldn't have
that many of our ships.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.083
It's a very simple matter
to take a cast off hulls

17:33.167 --> 17:35.125
of ships damaged during the war

17:35.208 --> 17:37.042
and retrofit them
onto Narn vessels.

17:37.125 --> 17:40.125
Minister, the attack we saw
could not have been faked.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.125
We agree,
it was a genuine attack

17:42.208 --> 17:44.417
on a civilian transport

17:44.500 --> 17:45.917
but the Narns
have always been willing

17:46.000 --> 17:48.458
to sacrifice innocent lives..

17:48.542 --> 17:50.500
...as long as we get
the blame for it.

17:50.583 --> 17:51.958
'Clearly, they sent a signal'

17:52.042 --> 17:54.292
'they knew would lure
Ranger Lennier'

17:54.375 --> 17:56.583
to a predetermined location

17:56.667 --> 17:59.042
then picked him up and simply
ferried him from place to place

17:59.125 --> 18:01.667
showing him
what they wanted him to see

18:01.750 --> 18:04.792
knowing he would bring it back
to Babylon 5.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.042
Because his character's
above reproach

18:07.125 --> 18:10.292
he is the perfect vessel
for their misinformation.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.792
Assuming you are correct,
what do we tell the council?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.500
They are waiting for a reply.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.583
The regent has drafted
a response.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.833
Item one.

18:24.917 --> 18:28.083
The Centauri Republic
categorically denies

18:28.167 --> 18:30.667
any involvement
with these attacks.

18:30.750 --> 18:33.167
We are the victims.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.042
Victims of an elaborate hoax.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.583
And we will identify
those responsible

18:38.667 --> 18:41.208
when more information
is at hand.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.250
Item two.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.208
The Centauri Republic
will not be threatened

18:47.292 --> 18:50.125
or intimidated by anyone..

18:50.208 --> 18:54.250
...including those we might
once have considered friends.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.750
As a result,
effective immediately..

18:57.833 --> 19:00.083
...we are withdrawing
from the Alliance.

19:00.167 --> 19:02.667
[indistinct chatter]

19:04.583 --> 19:07.000
And finally, item three.

19:07.083 --> 19:10.583
The Republic does not recognize
the legality of this blockade

19:10.667 --> 19:13.208
and thus will not
be limited by it.

19:13.292 --> 19:15.083
From now on

19:15.167 --> 19:18.833
all Centauri transports
entering into Alliance space

19:18.917 --> 19:22.375
will be accompanied
by one of our finest warships.

19:22.458 --> 19:26.042
Anyone firing on
one of our ships..

19:26.125 --> 19:29.417
...will be considered
committing an act of war..

19:30.583 --> 19:34.208
...and we will
respond appropriately.

19:35.833 --> 19:38.292
- Ambassador--
- That is all I came to say.

19:38.375 --> 19:41.417
As for myself, I will be
taking the first transport

19:41.500 --> 19:44.042
back to Centauri Prime
for further consultations

19:44.125 --> 19:46.792
with my government
concerning the situation here.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.333
Londo.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.667
The council is satisfied

19:50.750 --> 19:53.208
that your government
is behind these attacks.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.250
You cannot just walk
away from this one.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.750
Strange. I thought
I was doing just that.

19:57.833 --> 20:00.917
If you leave Babylon 5, you
won't be allowed back on again

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
until this crisis is resolved.

20:04.042 --> 20:06.625
Perhaps not even then.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.042
Well, then if that
is what you want..

20:12.750 --> 20:15.000
...I guess
I won't be coming back.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.250
'Meanwhile,
remember what I said.'

20:17.333 --> 20:21.333
Any attack on our ships,
any attack..

20:21.417 --> 20:24.000
...will be considered
an act of war.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.292
Vir.

20:25.375 --> 20:27.458
[indistinct chatter]

20:32.792 --> 20:34.583
Book me on the first ship
out of here.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.458
I have to get back home
as soon as possible.

20:36.542 --> 20:37.792
Londo, maybe you shouldn't.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.167
You heard what he said.
They're serious.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.333
Of course, they're serious
and so are we.

20:41.417 --> 20:43.708
And when we show them
we are not responsible

20:43.792 --> 20:45.667
they will back down,
even apologize

20:45.750 --> 20:49.250
but I can't do that here.
I have to go home.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.875
Alright, but I'm gonna
go with you.

20:50.958 --> 20:54.625
No. Vir, it is important
that you stay here.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.333
We need someone close at hand

20:56.417 --> 20:58.667
to, to show them the truth
when it comes along.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.417
To represent the Centauri
while I am locked out.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.250
Don't worry.
I won't be gone long.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.625
Just get me on that ship.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.792
[doorbell chimes]

21:17.875 --> 21:19.167
Enter.

21:23.833 --> 21:27.042
G'Kar, Lennier told me
you wanted to speak with me.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.542
Please.

21:32.750 --> 21:36.542
I wanted you to know that
when Mollari leaves Babylon 5

21:36.625 --> 21:40.208
I will be going with him
to the Centauri homeworld.

21:40.292 --> 21:42.167
What? Why?

21:42.250 --> 21:43.833
You said he needed a bodyguard

21:43.917 --> 21:46.875
the last time he went home
and you were right.

21:46.958 --> 21:49.042
If our assumption is correct

21:49.125 --> 21:50.375
and he truly does not know

21:50.458 --> 21:52.708
that his government
is behind these attacks

21:52.792 --> 21:55.000
if they have deliberately
kept him out of it--

21:55.083 --> 21:56.542
They have. They must have.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.375
Londo would never approve
of random attacks

21:58.458 --> 21:59.875
on civilian targets.

21:59.958 --> 22:02.042
Which is why he may be
in even greater danger

22:02.125 --> 22:03.500
once he returns home.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.542
Say what you want about him
and I can say quite a bit.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.083
He is relentless.

22:08.167 --> 22:10.667
Sooner or later,
he will find out what's going on

22:10.750 --> 22:14.125
and I believe
he will try to stop it.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.875
In the long run, he may be
our only hope of ending this.

22:17.958 --> 22:20.333
He must be protected
at all costs.

22:20.417 --> 22:22.750
- Have you told him this yet?
- No.

22:22.833 --> 22:26.833
I was thinking
of making it a surprise.

22:26.917 --> 22:29.167
I even booked the seat
right next to his.

22:29.250 --> 22:32.417
It will give me someone
to talk to during the flight.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.625
Londo once told me he hates it

22:34.708 --> 22:36.750
when people talk to him
on long flights.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.417
He prefers to sleep.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.917
[chuckles]
I know.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.083
Well, I should pack.

22:45.167 --> 22:47.292
Thank you for coming, Delenn.

22:48.667 --> 22:53.667
G'Kar, you realize
that if this does come to war

22:53.750 --> 22:56.583
you will be alone
on the Centauri homeworld.

22:56.667 --> 23:01.083
There is nothing we can do
to help you if things go badly.

23:02.542 --> 23:04.125
I know.

23:08.875 --> 23:12.792
These are the latest chapters
of my book.

23:12.875 --> 23:15.000
I tried to set right
a few of the things

23:15.083 --> 23:17.167
at the beginning of the book

23:17.250 --> 23:19.667
written when
I was a much angrier person

23:19.750 --> 23:22.167
than I am now.

23:22.250 --> 23:27.167
If things should,
as you say, go badly..

23:27.250 --> 23:30.708
...will you see to it
that these reach Narn?

23:33.208 --> 23:35.833
- I will.
- Thank you.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.417
Goodbye, Delenn.

23:40.542 --> 23:44.083
G'Kar...have I ever told you

23:44.167 --> 23:48.417
that you are one of the finest
writers I have ever met

23:48.500 --> 23:51.375
and that it has been an honor

23:51.458 --> 23:54.667
to work beside you
in the Alliance?

23:54.750 --> 23:56.208
Not in words.

23:57.708 --> 24:01.333
But the thing
about losing one eye..

24:01.417 --> 24:05.208
...is that it makes you look
deeply into the eyes of another.

24:06.667 --> 24:09.000
I found in yours

24:09.083 --> 24:12.375
all of the thanks
I will ever require

24:12.458 --> 24:16.042
in this life or in any other.

24:34.417 --> 24:35.875
- Zack.
- Yes, sir?

24:35.958 --> 24:37.583
Have you been able to get
a hold of Garibaldi yet?

24:37.667 --> 24:39.542
No, I've been trying
for the last hour.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.083
He isn't even answering
his link.

24:41.167 --> 24:43.208
Well, find him.
Get him to my quarters ASAP.

24:43.292 --> 24:45.375
- This is important.
- Yes, sir.

24:46.292 --> 24:47.708
[doorbell chimes]

24:54.917 --> 24:56.667
Yeah, yeah. Who is it?

24:56.750 --> 24:59.167
(Zack)
'Michael, it's me.
Come on, open up the door.'

25:01.792 --> 25:03.167
Just, uh..

25:04.667 --> 25:08.292
Just a second.
Just, just one second.

25:12.250 --> 25:13.292
Open.

25:14.292 --> 25:15.792
Michael, where the hell
you been?

25:15.875 --> 25:18.292
Sheridan's been trying to get
a hold of you for over an hour.

25:18.375 --> 25:20.417
I, uh, fell asleep.

25:20.500 --> 25:23.542
I was tired. I work hard.
I'm entitled.

25:23.625 --> 25:25.917
Yeah, well,
he said it's important.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.917
[laughs]
Yeah, yeah..

25:29.000 --> 25:31.625
Tell me when it is
ever not important.

25:31.708 --> 25:34.750
Alright, please, just tell me.
When is it ever not important?

25:34.833 --> 25:37.000
'Go ahead, go ahead,
take your time. I-I can wait.'

25:37.083 --> 25:38.333
Oh, no, that's right,
I can't wait

25:38.417 --> 25:40.500
because it's important.

25:40.583 --> 25:43.042
You're, uh, being
awfully cranky, Michael.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.500
You've been
taking your vitamins?

25:44.583 --> 25:46.333
Ah, will you give it
a rest, huh?

25:46.417 --> 25:48.083
Oh, I just figured
maybe you could use

25:48.167 --> 25:49.958
a little more Vitamin C
in your diet.

25:50.042 --> 25:52.250
Here, catch.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.292
Oh, sorry.
Uh, that was my fastball.

25:55.375 --> 25:56.875
Try this one.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.958
Hand-eye coordination sucks.

26:03.042 --> 26:05.458
- I told you I was asleep.
- You're drunk.

26:05.542 --> 26:08.333
- Ah, bull.
- Oh, yeah?

26:08.417 --> 26:11.125
Come over here where I can smell
your breath and say that.

26:11.208 --> 26:14.208
[scoffs]
I don't have to prove
anything to you, alright?

26:16.042 --> 26:19.458
You picked a great time
for this, Michael.

26:19.542 --> 26:23.458
Don't. Don't you dare
get self-righteous on me.

26:23.542 --> 26:25.500
You are the last person
on this station

26:25.583 --> 26:27.625
to get self-righteous
with anybody.

26:27.708 --> 26:29.667
You had a lot of problems
before you came here

26:29.750 --> 26:31.833
and I know, I know
you had some problems

26:31.917 --> 26:33.167
after you got here too.

26:33.250 --> 26:36.042
But did I say anything
to you about it? No.

26:36.125 --> 26:37.417
You wanna know why?

26:37.500 --> 26:39.417
Because I knew, I knew
you would work it out

26:39.500 --> 26:41.917
and you always did.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.333
'You have no idea what
I go through here every day.'

26:45.417 --> 26:47.208
The hassles,
the, the problems

26:47.292 --> 26:51.417
the pressures, the, the things
that people do to me.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.375
And why the hell am I
justifying myself to you?

26:54.458 --> 26:55.708
To you?

26:56.833 --> 26:58.458
No, as far as
I'm concerned, Zack

26:58.542 --> 27:01.250
you got no basis for taking
the moral high ground with me.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.708
No basis at all.

27:09.167 --> 27:10.417
[sighs]

27:13.583 --> 27:15.417
Oh, what the hell is that?

27:15.500 --> 27:16.833
If you wanna hurt me

27:16.917 --> 27:19.500
there's a cleaner
and faster way of doing it.

27:19.583 --> 27:21.708
Hell, you might even think
about it for yourself.

27:21.792 --> 27:23.250
It's a hell of a lot
more efficient

27:23.333 --> 27:25.208
than the road you're on
and you'll take fewer people

27:25.292 --> 27:27.417
with you when you go.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.750
Being a little melodramatic,
aren't you?

27:32.125 --> 27:34.708
You're an alcoholic, Michael.

27:34.792 --> 27:37.625
'You can't just have
a few drinks and get over it.'

27:37.708 --> 27:40.417
You can't justify it
or explain it.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.625
You can't play
the feel-sorry-for-me game

27:42.708 --> 27:44.375
or you're-no-better game

27:44.458 --> 27:45.583
and if I'm pissed at you

27:45.667 --> 27:47.708
it's because I'm your friend.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.583
And I know what you've been
through to get here.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.167
I've been through
the same thing myself

27:51.250 --> 27:53.833
and I don't wanna see you
throw it all away.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.333
You gonna turn me in?

28:03.542 --> 28:04.875
I don't know.

28:06.125 --> 28:09.750
If you don't know,
then, uh, just, just..

28:09.833 --> 28:12.667
...just give me a little bit
more time, Zack.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.833
If you turn me in,
they're gonna drop-kick my butt

28:14.917 --> 28:16.333
and I can kiss
my career goodbye

28:16.417 --> 28:19.125
before I have a chance
to fix anything.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.500
I just need a little bit
more time, that's all.

28:23.583 --> 28:25.667
Just to work some things out.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.167
Alright.

28:31.958 --> 28:33.625
Get your stuff,
we'll stop by security

28:33.708 --> 28:37.458
and pick up some oxy-pills
and get you into shape.

28:38.792 --> 28:40.333
Go on.

28:48.708 --> 28:51.125
(Sheridan)
We're in a critical situation
here, Michael.

28:51.208 --> 28:53.958
Virtually all the Centauri
deep-range transports

28:54.042 --> 28:55.792
are accompanied by warships.

28:55.875 --> 28:58.125
On our side, the Alliance Worlds

28:58.208 --> 29:00.458
have stationed cruisers
at their local jump points

29:00.542 --> 29:03.958
ready to open fire the second
the Centauri come through.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.917
'I mean, it-it's a powder keg
just waiting to go off.'

29:07.000 --> 29:10.750
I know. This is bad, John.
What are we gonna do about it?

29:10.833 --> 29:13.667
The Centauri have an ego

29:13.750 --> 29:15.542
about as big
as the galactic core

29:15.625 --> 29:17.208
but they're not stupid.

29:18.333 --> 29:20.667
Now if they come out
of hyperspace

29:20.750 --> 29:22.750
and see, uh, several Drazi

29:22.833 --> 29:25.125
or Brakiri warships
waiting for them

29:25.208 --> 29:27.667
they're gonna open fire because
they think they can handle it.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.250
And they're probably right,
they got some pretty

29:29.333 --> 29:30.958
solid armaments on their side.

29:31.042 --> 29:34.125
Exactly, but even the Centauri
will hesitate

29:34.208 --> 29:37.000
with a half a dozen
White Stars waiting for them

29:37.083 --> 29:39.333
and that is where you come in.

29:39.417 --> 29:43.125
See, I've got the Rangers
keeping tabs on the Centauri.

29:43.208 --> 29:45.542
They will relay
that information to you

29:45.625 --> 29:46.792
you will coordinate it

29:46.875 --> 29:50.000
so that we know
where they are at all times.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.167
It's not a problem.
Then what?

29:52.250 --> 29:54.375
Well, as soon as you know
when they're going to jump

29:54.458 --> 29:57.333
into Alliance space,
you let me know and we'll get

29:57.417 --> 29:59.792
as many White Stars
as we can into the area.

29:59.875 --> 30:02.208
We'll create a buffer zone
between the two sides

30:02.292 --> 30:05.208
enforcing the blockade
and turning the Centauri around

30:05.292 --> 30:09.667
while making sure that
our guys don't open fire first.

30:09.750 --> 30:13.500
It sounds unbelievably ugly.

30:13.583 --> 30:14.875
I know.

30:16.292 --> 30:17.750
Hey, I'm just trying to pull

30:17.833 --> 30:19.500
this situation
back from the brink.

30:19.583 --> 30:22.542
I mean, Delenn is on the line
to the Grey Council right now

30:22.625 --> 30:25.875
to see if the Minbari government
can talk some sense into them

30:25.958 --> 30:27.792
but I'm not holding out
any hope.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.375
No.

30:30.458 --> 30:31.792
Michael, this may be
our only chance

30:31.875 --> 30:33.958
to avoid a shooting war.

30:34.042 --> 30:36.458
So that's why it is so important
that you get that information

30:36.542 --> 30:38.708
to us as fast as you can,
so that we have time

30:38.792 --> 30:40.833
to get the White Stars
in position.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.667
You can rely on me.

30:47.750 --> 30:49.583
I'll get it done.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.917
[instrumental music]

31:07.208 --> 31:09.667
I don't like the looks
of this at all, G'Kar.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.750
Now you know
what it feels like.

31:11.833 --> 31:15.000
I have seen this view
of your warships many times.

31:15.083 --> 31:18.542
I didn't like it then
and I like it even less now.

31:25.458 --> 31:27.292
Ah, prime minister,
welcome back.

31:27.375 --> 31:30.000
I was hoping you'd return home,
get out of the line of fire.

31:30.083 --> 31:33.042
Well, thank you, but I'd rather
there wasn't a line of fire.

31:33.125 --> 31:37.208
Is that why you brought it along
to hear our terms?

31:37.292 --> 31:39.458
No, he is still here
as my bodyguard, that's all.

31:39.542 --> 31:42.167
- Where I go, he goes.
- My condolences.

31:42.250 --> 31:46.792
Thank you. It's a burden,
but I've come to accept it.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.708
Minister, I would like to see
the regent as soon as possible.

31:49.792 --> 31:51.792
I'm afraid the regent
is otherwise engaged

31:51.875 --> 31:53.125
and will be for some time.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.125
Minister, you cannot deny me
access to--

31:55.208 --> 31:57.625
(Cholini)
'No one is denying
you anything, prime minister'

31:57.708 --> 32:00.958
but there is a time and a place
and a way of doing things.

32:01.042 --> 32:03.500
When the time is right,
you will see the regent.

32:03.583 --> 32:07.042
Meanwhile, I suggest
you retire to your quarters.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.958
It's late. I'm sure
you'd like to freshen up.

32:10.042 --> 32:11.208
Both of you.

32:11.292 --> 32:14.583
It's a natural musk.
I rather enjoy it.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.583
I was noticing
there are a few more guards

32:16.667 --> 32:17.583
around here than normal.

32:17.667 --> 32:19.000
Yes, we've increased security

32:19.083 --> 32:20.375
throughout the palace
for obvious reasons.

32:20.458 --> 32:22.167
So while we are willing
to tolerate the presence

32:22.250 --> 32:25.542
of your companion for your sake,
understand that if he's seen

32:25.625 --> 32:28.000
walking anywhere
in the palace by himself

32:28.083 --> 32:29.167
he will be shot on sight.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.458
Be careful, minister.

32:30.542 --> 32:33.167
We don't want my companion
to get the wrong idea.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.625
We don't normally treat
our guests so badly.

32:35.708 --> 32:37.792
- Yes, you do.
- Shut up.

32:37.875 --> 32:40.750
- Just trying to help.
- Come.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.000
[beeps]

32:48.083 --> 32:50.542
(man on radio)
'This is White Star 43
to Michael Garibaldi.'

32:50.625 --> 32:53.333
'We have an urgent message
on Centauri movements.'

32:53.417 --> 32:55.000
'Please respond.'

32:55.083 --> 32:56.875
'I repeat.
This is White Star 43.'

32:56.958 --> 32:59.042
'We have an urgent message
concerning the movements'

32:59.125 --> 33:00.750
'of Centauri warships.'

33:00.833 --> 33:02.250
'Please respond.'

33:03.417 --> 33:04.708
'Alright, we're going in
after them'

33:04.792 --> 33:06.000
'alone if we have to.'

33:06.083 --> 33:07.875
'Uploading data to your system.'

33:07.958 --> 33:09.375
'When you get this message,
please inform'

33:09.458 --> 33:11.875
'President Sheridan
as fast as you can.'

33:11.958 --> 33:14.542
'White Star 43 out.'

33:21.750 --> 33:23.000
(man on radio)
'Drazi blockade squadron'

33:23.083 --> 33:25.167
'to Centauri transports
and warships.'

33:25.250 --> 33:28.583
'You are ordered to turn back
or prepare to be boarded.'

33:34.833 --> 33:36.417
'This is your last warning.'

33:36.500 --> 33:40.250
'You will surrender your ships
and prepare to be boarded.'

33:42.500 --> 33:45.167
(man on radio)
'This is White Star 43
to Drazi and Centauri vessels.'

33:45.250 --> 33:47.750
'Hold your fire.
I repeat, hold your fire!'

33:47.833 --> 33:50.000
[gunfire]

33:51.208 --> 33:54.042
[explosion]

34:00.333 --> 34:01.917
[doorbell chimes]

34:04.292 --> 34:05.458
Hmm?

34:05.542 --> 34:07.000
[doorbell chimes]

34:15.958 --> 34:17.333
[sighs]

34:21.417 --> 34:22.958
Yes?

34:24.292 --> 34:26.042
[indistinct chatter]

34:34.083 --> 34:36.208
It was Zack. He..

34:37.708 --> 34:40.375
You should get dressed.

34:40.458 --> 34:41.917
It's started.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.500
What do you mean,
you can't put me

34:45.583 --> 34:47.375
in touch
with the prime minister?

34:47.458 --> 34:49.333
I'm sorry, but he's unavailable.

34:49.417 --> 34:50.583
You'll have to try back later.

34:50.667 --> 34:54.042
Wait a second.
This is important.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.083
I think he would want
to know about this.

34:56.167 --> 34:58.667
We are aware of the situation.

34:58.750 --> 35:01.125
There is no need
for overreaction.

35:01.208 --> 35:02.667
We will inform
Prime Minister Mollari

35:02.750 --> 35:05.125
of all the details
when he is available.

35:05.208 --> 35:07.458
- Good day.
- Yes, but do..

35:07.542 --> 35:09.000
Oh!

35:09.083 --> 35:10.458
Oh.

35:14.083 --> 35:15.208
[doorbell chimes]

35:16.417 --> 35:18.500
Yes? Who is it?

35:18.583 --> 35:21.292
- 'Dr. Franklin.'
- Oh, open.

35:22.708 --> 35:24.833
See, there you are and I've been
looking all over for you.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.208
- You weren't in your quarters.
- No.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.083
The pass codes for
the royal com system are here--

35:28.167 --> 35:29.458
It doesn't matter.
Alright, look.

35:29.542 --> 35:31.208
The president sent me,
he wants you out of here

35:31.292 --> 35:32.875
and into new quarters ASAP.

35:32.958 --> 35:33.875
Why?

35:33.958 --> 35:34.958
Look, the council is

35:35.042 --> 35:36.208
up in arms over the fighting.

35:36.292 --> 35:37.292
Centauri cruisers have taken out

35:37.375 --> 35:38.333
several of their ships.

35:38.417 --> 35:39.583
They're gonna take it out on you

35:39.667 --> 35:40.750
if we don't get out
of here quietly.

35:40.833 --> 35:41.958
That's why he didn't
send security.

35:42.042 --> 35:43.375
Now the less we draw attention

35:43.458 --> 35:44.542
the more we can avoid trouble.

35:44.625 --> 35:46.167
- Now come on.
- Wait a second.

35:46.250 --> 35:47.958
Londo, he may call.
I need to be here.

35:48.042 --> 35:50.250
Look, we will route all your
calls to the new quarters.

35:50.333 --> 35:51.708
Now come on.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.250
- Walk away, doctor.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

36:10.333 --> 36:13.292
Walk away
and we will not hurt you

36:13.375 --> 36:14.583
but this one.

36:14.667 --> 36:17.000
'His kind killed over
100 of our people'

36:17.083 --> 36:19.583
'and ran like the cowards
they are.'

36:19.667 --> 36:22.583
If we can't take
our revenge on them

36:22.667 --> 36:24.000
we will take it out on him.

36:24.083 --> 36:27.125
But this man speaks
for the Centauri.

36:27.208 --> 36:28.417
He has diplomatic immunity.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.333
[chuckles]
We're not diplomats.

36:30.417 --> 36:31.625
[laughing]

36:31.708 --> 36:32.917
Alright, fine.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.708
You want him,
you gotta go through me.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.000
A fair deal.

36:36.083 --> 36:38.083
Unless, of course,
you want Mollari.

36:38.167 --> 36:40.583
I mean, you know, he's, uh..

36:40.667 --> 36:42.417
...far more responsible,
after all and..

36:42.500 --> 36:44.667
[grunts]

36:46.292 --> 36:48.833
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

36:51.125 --> 36:55.125
- 'What the hell went wrong?'
- I don't know.

36:55.208 --> 36:56.917
What do you mean,
you don't know?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.167
Look, we did everything we could
to keep track of the Centauri.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.583
Apparently, one of them
got past us

37:00.667 --> 37:03.000
hit the blockade,
opened fire on the Drazi.

37:03.083 --> 37:04.458
Are we sure they fired first?

37:04.542 --> 37:06.167
There's so many rumors
floating around.

37:06.250 --> 37:08.083
I can't be sure of anything,
but from what we can tell

37:08.167 --> 37:09.708
yeah, they fired first.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.292
Perhaps we can speak
with 'em. We--

37:12.375 --> 37:14.500
I think they're tired
of listening, Lennier.

37:14.583 --> 37:16.083
[indistinct chatter]

37:16.167 --> 37:18.583
Did you hear? Did you hear
what they did to us?

37:18.667 --> 37:19.792
Yes, we heard.

37:19.875 --> 37:21.792
Then where is
the White Star fleet?

37:21.875 --> 37:23.750
You said you would
support our actions.

37:23.833 --> 37:25.833
You said you would aid
in fighting the Centauri

37:25.917 --> 37:28.042
but the White Star fleet
is just sitting there

37:28.125 --> 37:29.292
refusing to engage.

37:29.375 --> 37:31.167
We have not yet
ordered them to do so.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.750
- What? Then give the order.
- Back away, ambassador.

37:34.833 --> 37:35.958
Get out of my way.

37:36.042 --> 37:37.667
He's right.
Where's the fleet?

37:37.750 --> 37:40.417
Alright.
Everybody, just back off.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.167
- Back off?
- Back off!

37:42.250 --> 37:44.125
[indistinct chatter]

37:45.208 --> 37:46.875
That's enough.

37:46.958 --> 37:49.000
I said that's enough!

37:52.042 --> 37:54.500
Now we gave you a promise

37:54.583 --> 37:56.125
and we are bound
by that promise

37:56.208 --> 37:58.167
and damn you for asking for it.

37:58.250 --> 38:00.625
And damn me for agreeing to it.

38:00.708 --> 38:02.333
And damn all of us to hell

38:02.417 --> 38:04.750
because that is exactly
where we're going!

38:04.833 --> 38:06.708
We talked about peace.

38:06.792 --> 38:08.042
You didn't want peace.

38:08.125 --> 38:09.667
We talked about cooperation.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.583
You didn't want cooperation.

38:11.667 --> 38:14.000
You want war.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.917
Is that it?

38:16.000 --> 38:19.708
You want a war?
Well, you've got a war.

38:23.458 --> 38:25.833
[instrumental music]

38:28.833 --> 38:30.833
[knock on door]

38:30.917 --> 38:33.417
No, no, wait.
Who is it?

38:33.500 --> 38:36.542
(Cholini)
'Open the door, prime minister.'

38:36.625 --> 38:38.000
Just a minute.

38:44.125 --> 38:47.708
Yes? What is this?

38:47.792 --> 38:49.833
The regent sent me to tell you
that fighting has broken out

38:49.917 --> 38:52.458
between our forces
and the Interstellar Alliance.

38:52.542 --> 38:54.083
I'm also told
that they have followed

38:54.167 --> 38:57.542
our declaration of hostilities
with one of their own.

38:57.625 --> 39:00.250
We are now officially at war
with the Alliance.

39:00.333 --> 39:03.250
No, no. This can still
be stopped. I will call them.

39:03.333 --> 39:06.333
(Cholini)
'All communication
with Babylon 5 has been cut off'

39:06.417 --> 39:08.083
'for reasons of security.'

39:08.167 --> 39:09.417
For similar reasons

39:09.500 --> 39:14.000
I'm afraid we must place
your companion under arrest.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.958
'You may have resigned'

39:16.042 --> 39:19.208
but he is still on the advisory
board of the Alliance.

39:19.292 --> 39:21.417
His very presence
represents a threat

39:21.500 --> 39:24.042
to our ability to conduct
the war freely

39:24.125 --> 39:26.250
without having
our plans compromised.

39:26.333 --> 39:28.542
No, this is most inappropriate.

39:28.625 --> 39:30.583
He will be placed
in one of our better cells

39:30.667 --> 39:34.583
until the war is over,
however long that may take.

39:34.667 --> 39:37.250
- Guards.
- I said no.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.375
He is here as my guest.

39:39.458 --> 39:42.625
These orders come
directly from the regent.

39:42.708 --> 39:44.125
To refuse a direct order

39:44.208 --> 39:46.333
carries with it
the penalty of death.

39:46.417 --> 39:47.750
It's alright, Mollari.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.958
I have already seen
the inside of your cells.

39:50.042 --> 39:53.000
I doubt that I will see anything
now that I haven't seen before.

39:53.083 --> 39:54.375
You are not going anywhere.

39:54.458 --> 39:57.167
I told you before,
where I go, he goes.

39:57.250 --> 39:59.500
And where he goes, I go.

39:59.583 --> 40:02.333
- Mollari.
- Don't worry.

40:02.417 --> 40:04.458
Even one as arrogant as this

40:04.542 --> 40:06.458
would not take it
upon himself

40:06.542 --> 40:09.292
to imprison
his own prime minister.

40:09.375 --> 40:11.042
[door closes]

40:22.500 --> 40:25.500
- Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.

40:30.750 --> 40:32.417
(Londo)
Great Maker.

40:33.792 --> 40:36.542
Sometimes I feel I..

40:36.625 --> 40:39.500
'...I don't understand
anything anymore.'

41:11.000 --> 41:12.333
Praying?

41:13.500 --> 41:16.083
Not in the sense
you mean it, but..

41:16.167 --> 41:17.250
...yes.

41:19.667 --> 41:21.667
You mind if I join you?

41:37.125 --> 41:40.208
What does the candle represent?

41:40.292 --> 41:41.583
Life.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.958
Whose life?

41:45.042 --> 41:48.042
All life. Every life.

41:50.125 --> 41:53.625
We are all born as molecules

41:53.708 --> 41:56.792
in the hearts
of a billion stars.

41:56.875 --> 41:59.292
Molecules that do not
understand politics

41:59.375 --> 42:02.375
or policies or differences.

42:03.625 --> 42:06.750
Over a billion years
we foolish molecules

42:06.833 --> 42:10.750
forget who we are
and where we came from.

42:10.833 --> 42:13.167
In desperate acts of ego

42:13.250 --> 42:14.917
we give ourselves names

42:15.000 --> 42:17.208
fight over lines on maps

42:17.292 --> 42:19.250
and pretend that our light

42:19.333 --> 42:21.958
is better than everyone else's.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.333
The flame reminds us

42:26.417 --> 42:28.958
of the piece of those stars

42:29.042 --> 42:31.375
that lives on inside us.

42:31.458 --> 42:34.625
The spark that tells us..

42:34.708 --> 42:36.583
'...you should know better.'

42:37.708 --> 42:39.625
'The flame also reminds us'

42:39.708 --> 42:41.958
'that life is precious'

42:42.042 --> 42:44.375
as each flame is unique.

42:44.458 --> 42:46.667
When it goes out

42:46.750 --> 42:48.708
it's gone forever.

42:49.875 --> 42:53.167
And there will never be
another quite like it.

42:56.625 --> 42:59.458
So many candles
will go out tonight.

43:01.792 --> 43:03.458
I wonder some days..

43:04.958 --> 43:07.625
...if we can see
anything at all.

43:17.583 --> 43:20.083
[instrumental music]

43:31.708 --> 43:33.917
[theme music]
