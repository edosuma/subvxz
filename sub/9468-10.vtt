00:24.664 --> 00:26.207
What time is it?

00:29.376 --> 00:32.963
It's two weeks
since you passed out.

00:33.006 --> 00:34.966
What?

00:35.006 --> 00:37.426
Oh, fuck me.

00:42.493 --> 00:46.185
- The full moon.
- It's tonight.

00:49.021 --> 00:51.191
That's why I had
to come back now.

00:51.231 --> 00:53.276
- That's why I had to come back.
- Whoa, wait, wait.

00:53.317 --> 00:55.987
- Easy, easy. We should get you
a doctor. All right? - Why?

00:56.029 --> 00:58.323
Complications?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.325
What kind?

01:00.365 --> 01:02.408
How the fuck should I know?
I-I was told

01:02.450 --> 01:04.453
that comas cause
blank spots or memory shit.

01:17.465 --> 01:21.262
What? So I check out for two weeks
and suddenly I'm a fucking retard?

01:23.763 --> 01:27.099
Did my mom tell you
what happened?

01:27.143 --> 01:30.980
Yeah.
She said you OD'd.

01:31.022 --> 01:33.024
Yeah.

01:33.066 --> 01:35.816
Pretty stupid, huh?

01:35.858 --> 01:38.194
The thing is I...

01:38.236 --> 01:41.156
I made some mistakes, OK?

01:41.197 --> 01:43.408
But we really need to do this.

01:43.450 --> 01:45.409
Do what?

01:45.450 --> 01:48.331
Kill the vargulf. Make,
make, make things right.

01:48.373 --> 01:51.792
As much as I fucking hate to say it,
the ball's in my court now, OK?

01:51.834 --> 01:54.587
No.

01:54.628 --> 01:57.006
What do you mean, no?
What are you doing? Come on.

01:57.048 --> 01:58.507
I'm getting the fuck up!
I'm getting the fuck up!

01:58.549 --> 02:02.552
OK. All right. OK.

02:02.593 --> 02:05.638
OK.

02:10.477 --> 02:13.520
We both made some.

02:13.562 --> 02:16.483
What?

02:16.525 --> 02:18.526
Mistakes.

02:22.656 --> 02:24.616
We need to go.

02:24.657 --> 02:27.245
We're running out of time.

03:24.925 --> 03:27.221
Thank God.

03:27.263 --> 03:30.514
So you're just gonna walk away?

03:30.556 --> 03:32.893
- What, you want to leave a note?
- It's not my call.

03:36.562 --> 03:38.358
This thing we have to do,

03:38.399 --> 03:41.776
my mom's not part of it.

03:41.818 --> 03:45.823
She gets pissed, I'll
blame it on a blank spot.

03:48.699 --> 03:50.661
Oh, you're not driving.

03:50.703 --> 03:52.663
You know how to drive stick?

03:52.705 --> 03:57.126
Just give me the fucking keys.

03:57.168 --> 03:59.127
All right.

Hey, sis.

04:50.512 --> 04:53.223
Hi, Michael.

04:53.266 --> 04:56.435
[Are the leaves pretty there?]

04:56.475 --> 04:59.146
- Very.
- [What's on your mind?]

04:59.187 --> 05:01.189
I'm done.

05:04.235 --> 05:06.903
After I do what I came here
to do, I'm leaving the Order.

05:06.946 --> 05:08.906
[It's not supposed
to feel this way.]

05:08.947 --> 05:10.699
What way?

05:10.740 --> 05:12.826
[Like doing the right thing
is this fucked up.]

05:12.867 --> 05:14.870
One second.

05:29.009 --> 05:30.970
You're working.

05:31.011 --> 05:34.807
I'm on a beach in Hawaii.

05:48.112 --> 05:50.531
- Will they let you?
- [What?]

05:50.572 --> 05:52.324
Will they let you leave?

05:52.365 --> 05:55.995
No.

05:57.997 --> 06:01.708
[Will you help me?]

06:01.750 --> 06:05.129
Michael?

06:08.466 --> 06:11.009
Yes, anything you need.

06:11.050 --> 06:13.095
Tomorrow at dawn

06:13.137 --> 06:15.096
by the water.

06:15.139 --> 06:17.766
- [You know the place.]
- OK.

06:17.807 --> 06:21.060
OK.

06:48.254 --> 06:51.132
Why are we stopping?

06:51.175 --> 06:53.134
Because someone
needs to say it.

06:53.177 --> 06:55.971
The vargulf is my problem.

06:56.012 --> 06:58.891
I'm the one on the hook.

06:58.932 --> 07:01.350
And?

07:01.394 --> 07:03.353
Why are you here?

07:03.396 --> 07:06.148
You know.

07:08.442 --> 07:12.446
Yeah, I thought I did--
for a while.

07:12.487 --> 07:14.947
Then it all went to shit.

07:14.990 --> 07:16.750
Tell me why you want
to come with me tonight.

07:19.076 --> 07:21.038
It's not about being a hero.

07:21.079 --> 07:23.081
Are you sure about that?

07:27.377 --> 07:30.254
I'm sorry for being a pain
in your balls, OK?

07:30.297 --> 07:32.466
I got confused.

07:32.507 --> 07:35.843
Things are clearer now.

07:40.682 --> 07:42.891
At what point does trusting you

07:42.935 --> 07:45.896
make me a fucking idiot?

07:45.937 --> 07:48.064
I wish no one else
had to get hurt.

07:48.107 --> 07:51.151
Someone is--tonight.

07:53.737 --> 07:55.447
I know.

07:57.449 --> 08:00.786
Look, I just wanna be
your friend.

08:00.826 --> 08:02.370
You shouldn't be
out there alone.

08:06.709 --> 08:08.834
Simple as that.

08:11.754 --> 08:13.716
You're a loose cannon, Godfrey.

08:13.757 --> 08:16.593
I'm gonna have your goddamn
stripes for this.

08:22.307 --> 08:25.435
It's almost like a dream.

08:25.478 --> 08:28.230
We're all just passing through
the motions of our days

08:28.271 --> 08:32.230
like shadow puppets
or ghosts of who we were.

08:38.447 --> 08:41.408
<i>I miss</i>
<i>him too.</i>

08:41.451 --> 08:43.412
Think anything
can ever be the same?

08:43.451 --> 08:45.623
See you later.

09:03.557 --> 09:06.850
<i>Lest you not forsake us,</i>
<i>Lord, and sustain us.</i>

09:06.893 --> 09:10.105
Bless and protect your flock,

09:10.147 --> 09:13.192
those who follow
and those who stray.

09:13.230 --> 09:15.778
And if it be Thy will,

09:15.820 --> 09:19.153
the recovery of fellow student
Roman Godfrey,

09:19.197 --> 09:23.408
<i>who remains in a coma.</i>

09:26.995 --> 09:28.999
Good work.

09:34.547 --> 09:36.629
A little shading there...

09:36.673 --> 09:38.341
Darker down there.

09:42.346 --> 09:44.471
That's really good.

09:44.514 --> 09:46.807
<i>Ladies room. Emergency.</i>

09:46.850 --> 09:50.062
OK, Shelley.

10:00.113 --> 10:03.490
OK, Shelley. Shelley.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.451
Shh.

10:05.494 --> 10:09.538
It's OK, I'm fine.

10:09.581 --> 10:12.500
<i>- I'm glad you're back. </i>
- I know.

10:12.543 --> 10:15.211
I didn't want you to worry,
but I'm really OK.

10:18.965 --> 10:20.926
<i>Does mother know?</i>

10:20.966 --> 10:24.221
I have something
I need to do first.

10:26.932 --> 10:28.893
<i>Don't go.</i>

10:28.932 --> 10:30.850
I'm not going anywhere,

10:30.894 --> 10:32.855
but I started something
I can't walk away from,

10:32.897 --> 10:36.442
and it's really important
you still believe in me.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.028
OK? Nothing is more
important right now.

10:44.950 --> 10:46.908
I'll be home soon.

10:46.951 --> 10:49.830
I'll come back to you.

10:58.336 --> 11:00.633
<i>Be good.</i>

11:00.673 --> 11:03.594
Yeah, that's the idea.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.894
<i>Sheriff Sworn, could you address
some of the wild rumors going around</i>

11:13.937 --> 11:16.440
<i>about the nature</i>
<i>of these attacks?</i>

11:16.480 --> 11:19.485
<i>Is this in fact a wild animal, or,
as the fringe have suggested,</i>

11:19.524 --> 11:22.028
<i>is it some maniac</i>
<i>mimicking a werewolf?</i>

11:22.070 --> 11:24.782
<i>Forensics tells us the attacks</i>
<i>are animal in nature,</i>

11:24.822 --> 11:28.118
<i>but the pattern of the last</i>
<i>two months can't be denied.</i>

11:28.158 --> 11:29.373
<i>Meaning what exactly?</i>

11:29.493 --> 11:32.336
<i>Meaning a curfew will be
in effect for all minors</i>

11:32.456 --> 11:35.542
<i>as of sundown. Non-minors</i>
<i>on the street after sundown</i>

11:35.581 --> 11:37.961
<i>will be expected to have</i>
<i>a damn good reason to be.</i>

11:38.000 --> 11:41.214
<i>Thank you, Sheriff Sworn.</i>
<i>You heard it. Stay inside</i>

11:41.254 --> 11:43.258
<i>and lock your doors.</i>

11:46.052 --> 11:48.052
Let's go.

12:14.498 --> 12:16.500
Roman?

12:18.625 --> 12:21.004
Roman!

12:45.988 --> 12:48.782
That little shit.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.875
- Protocol.
- [Cipher.]

13:00.995 --> 13:02.350
Little mouse.

13:02.711 --> 13:05.340
So, we've made progress
with the target

13:05.379 --> 13:08.176
and now we're ready
for containment?

13:08.216 --> 13:10.677
- Yes.
- [Excellent.]

13:10.721 --> 13:14.682
[Because we've received a rather disconcerting
call from your brother, Michael.]

13:14.725 --> 13:18.144
- Michael called you?
- He's worried about you.

13:18.186 --> 13:20.230
It seems rather a team sport

13:20.272 --> 13:22.230
for those who are fond of you.

13:22.274 --> 13:25.485
- There's nothing to worry about.
- [Horseshit.]

13:25.527 --> 13:28.238
Are you all right, little mouse?

13:28.278 --> 13:30.908
[I can't say this
has been an easy one, ]

13:30.950 --> 13:34.826
but in the words of the immortal
Hank Williams, I've seen the light.

13:36.830 --> 13:40.000
I worry that, of my assets,

13:40.042 --> 13:42.210
my own objectivity
is most clouded

13:42.250 --> 13:44.211
where you are concerned.

13:44.254 --> 13:46.214
Are you expecting an apology

13:46.254 --> 13:48.466
for my winning personality?

13:50.469 --> 13:53.931
- Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
- [I know, ]

13:53.971 --> 13:56.557
- and thank you, sir.
- [Good.]

13:56.600 --> 14:00.186
Good.

14:00.225 --> 14:02.230
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

14:07.192 --> 14:09.446
And all that.

14:25.961 --> 14:29.716
State troopers are covering all the
park entrances and trailheads.

14:29.758 --> 14:33.219
We've got a circuit of volunteer
firemen, mostly hunters.

14:33.259 --> 14:37.182
They're covering the, uh, utility
easement perches throughout town.

14:37.221 --> 14:39.932
- Firemen? - Yeah, we're working
with what we've got, Doctor.

14:39.975 --> 14:43.187
Of course. I understand you're setting
up a network of feeder lights.

14:43.229 --> 14:46.399
Through the wooded areas. Look,
we're all hands on deck here,

14:46.441 --> 14:49.110
so if you don't mind?

14:49.153 --> 14:52.238
Tell Smokey the Bear
we said hello.

14:52.278 --> 14:55.993
That's the forest service.
We're Puddles the Blue Goose.

14:56.033 --> 14:58.662
- Well, <i>pardonnez-moi. </i>
- Sheriff.

14:58.701 --> 15:01.788
I've tried to be
patient with you,

15:01.831 --> 15:03.831
but I am at the end of my rope.

15:06.961 --> 15:09.254
Don't let the comfort
of numbers confuse you.

15:09.297 --> 15:11.966
- Excuse me?
- You know where you're needed.

15:12.009 --> 15:14.302
Oh, really? And where is that?

15:14.344 --> 15:18.471
My line of work,
we use the term umwelt.

15:18.514 --> 15:20.850
It's a model of the world

15:20.893 --> 15:24.144
based on a specific creature's
experiences, their perceptions--

15:24.187 --> 15:26.899
how and what it sees.

15:26.940 --> 15:30.317
Trust that feeling in your gut.

15:30.360 --> 15:34.153
This thing we're after,

15:34.197 --> 15:37.325
it's not anything close to done.

15:37.365 --> 15:40.787
I'm gonna do my part. Just
making sure you'll do yours.

15:40.826 --> 15:44.166
OK, besides the obvious,

15:44.206 --> 15:46.710
I have no idea what the hell
any of that means.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.046
Just that you have
a lot to protect.

15:49.086 --> 15:52.716
What is it you're not
telling me?

15:55.052 --> 15:57.134
Not a thing.

15:57.177 --> 15:59.264
Just making sure
we're on the same page.

15:59.302 --> 16:02.557
Jesus Christ.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.311
Thank you for your hospitality,
Sheriff.

16:05.350 --> 16:08.148
You're leaving?

16:08.190 --> 16:10.399
We all gotta go sometime.

16:10.442 --> 16:12.735
Sorry.

16:12.778 --> 16:14.778
Good luck tonight.

16:31.754 --> 16:34.216
- Hey, Christina.
- Hey.

16:37.302 --> 16:39.263
How was your day?

16:39.302 --> 16:43.100
Well, I'd love
to say tremendous,

16:43.142 --> 16:45.557
but that would just be
a fabrication of the truth,

16:45.600 --> 16:49.273
a distortion. It was OK.

16:51.274 --> 16:54.985
Ooh, you've been
writing. May I?

17:06.999 --> 17:09.709
Oh, I, um, I received
your request to lower your meds.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.296
Yeah. I just,

17:12.336 --> 17:16.087
I just feel like...

17:16.133 --> 17:18.093
they're, like,

17:18.134 --> 17:22.055
blocking something.

17:22.096 --> 17:26.101
Like... I can't
find my way back.

17:26.143 --> 17:28.557
Well, I think
we can start to do that.

17:28.603 --> 17:30.438
Soon.

17:37.278 --> 17:39.614
You know,

17:39.653 --> 17:43.701
it used to be that my favorite
thing in the whole world

17:43.740 --> 17:47.038
was to swim
at night on the lake

17:47.076 --> 17:49.582
by the light of the full moon.

17:49.624 --> 17:54.125
There was nothing
like it in the world.

17:54.171 --> 17:57.586
Do you believe in magic?

18:00.344 --> 18:02.346
Magic?

18:04.890 --> 18:06.892
Sometimes.

18:10.979 --> 18:13.519
Would you rather be at home
tonight with your parents?

18:13.565 --> 18:15.650
I'm on my way home myself.

18:15.692 --> 18:17.942
I mean, I can take you
if you like,

18:17.986 --> 18:22.153
- if it'll make you feel better.
- Thanks, but...

18:22.199 --> 18:24.701
it'll get me if it wants me.

18:26.701 --> 18:28.663
Christina,

18:28.701 --> 18:30.663
you'll be safe here.

18:30.707 --> 18:33.164
OK.

18:35.336 --> 18:37.336
Good night, sweetheart.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.692
Hey, Tom.

18:59.736 --> 19:02.568
I believe I've accepted

19:02.614 --> 19:05.365
I've fallen victim
to collective hysteria.

19:05.409 --> 19:07.490
Well,

19:07.535 --> 19:09.971
there is the irrational and then
there's the baseless, Norman.

19:09.996 --> 19:12.538
There's nothing baseless here.

19:12.582 --> 19:15.375
I posted the extra men
that you asked for at the gate.

19:15.419 --> 19:17.586
I know you're overextended,

19:17.625 --> 19:20.199
but consider the expense
out of my own pocket.

19:20.317 --> 19:23.259
No, no. I appreciate it,
but not necessary, not tonight.

19:23.298 --> 19:26.259
Is this gonna happen
every goddamn full moon?

19:26.305 --> 19:29.266
Yes. No.

19:31.307 --> 19:33.394
I came to see about Chrissy.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.644
I'm afraid there hasn't been
much of an improvement,

19:35.688 --> 19:38.817
which is common
with her condition.

19:38.855 --> 19:41.951
- You need time to reintegrate.
- Are you gonna give me

19:42.075 --> 19:43.413
this one step forward crap?

19:43.534 --> 19:46.413
They're tougher than we are.
We forget that.

19:46.865 --> 19:49.365
Fair enough.

19:49.411 --> 19:52.576
And the home front?

19:52.622 --> 19:55.913
It was a struggle,
but the girls are on lockdown.

19:55.959 --> 19:59.086
I had it my way, I'd lock them down every night.
I might sleep a little better.

19:59.125 --> 20:01.131
I'm heading home now.

20:03.587 --> 20:06.548
You know, come tomorrow,

20:06.594 --> 20:08.721
somebody better buy me
a fucking beer.

20:08.759 --> 20:10.556
You got it.

20:18.980 --> 20:21.192
I don't suppose you know
anything about this?

20:21.230 --> 20:24.237
Where Roman's gone?

20:26.239 --> 20:30.240
The beauty of your inability to
speak is the inability to lie.

20:30.285 --> 20:34.288
It's rather refreshing
of my children.

20:39.085 --> 20:42.047
Don't worry.
I'm not cross.

20:42.086 --> 20:44.383
With you, at any rate.

20:51.181 --> 20:53.141
<i>You're worried?</i>

20:53.182 --> 20:55.268
Of course I am,

20:55.307 --> 20:58.144
but there's no
pleasanter feeling

20:58.188 --> 21:01.566
than of necessity.
Unfortunately,

21:01.605 --> 21:04.817
if you've done
your job adequately,

21:04.861 --> 21:07.113
in spite of yourself,

21:07.153 --> 21:09.949
you find you're not
needed at all.

21:09.990 --> 21:11.951
You think I haven't
known what he was up to

21:11.990 --> 21:14.326
this entire bloody while?

21:14.371 --> 21:16.998
These roles were assigned
before recorded time.

21:17.038 --> 21:21.086
These same boards trod
a thousand generations.

21:23.046 --> 21:26.173
And somehow the climax
is as unforeseeable

21:26.212 --> 21:30.134
and astonishing
every goddamn time.

21:33.721 --> 21:37.102
<i>Will he be all right?</i>

21:37.143 --> 21:40.605
It's a pity you don't drink.

21:48.738 --> 21:50.698
You're sure about this?

21:50.740 --> 21:53.576
Are you?

21:58.582 --> 22:02.164
I'll be able to pick up its scent
from where it left the girl.

22:02.210 --> 22:03.920
Will I be able to keep up?

22:03.961 --> 22:06.336
No.

22:08.633 --> 22:10.634
You should watch your back.

22:20.019 --> 22:22.019
Do you love her?

22:26.276 --> 22:28.278
Yeah.

22:28.317 --> 22:31.693
- Shee-it.
- Shee-it.

22:37.241 --> 22:40.702
Do you remember anything?
From when you were out?

22:40.748 --> 22:44.375
A little. Still
mostly a feeling,

22:44.419 --> 22:47.671
like I have something
unfinished,

22:47.711 --> 22:50.342
- something I need to do.
- Like what?

22:53.509 --> 22:55.510
Guess I'll know when I see it.

22:55.555 --> 22:56.931
Hmm.

23:37.805 --> 23:40.642
Come back, Tilson.

23:40.682 --> 23:43.644
[Tilson, Reed and Fountain,
position clear.]

23:43.683 --> 23:47.105
[All right, continue
to respond, guys.]

23:47.144 --> 23:49.355
Copy.

23:59.865 --> 24:02.622
Copy. Brady position, come back.

24:02.663 --> 24:04.788
[Brady, Main and Skyline, ]

24:04.832 --> 24:07.960
[position clear.]

24:17.845 --> 24:20.932
"Went to bed hungry.
Woke up with a boner."

24:20.971 --> 24:24.477
Ew, that's so gross. I don't
even get it. Who said that?

24:24.519 --> 24:28.644
- Steve Berna.
- Oh, he's hot, but so dumb.

24:28.690 --> 24:31.775
Oh, my god. Leigh Anne Morris
changed her profile picture

24:31.817 --> 24:34.987
to that. She looks like
a walrus with a UTI.

24:35.028 --> 24:38.279
And what does a walrus
look like when it has a UTI?

24:38.324 --> 24:41.411
When you know that walrus
has been dating Luke Vezetti

24:41.451 --> 24:43.413
and he hasn't washed his hands
since third grade.

24:43.451 --> 24:47.038
- Oh, sick!
- Gun to your head:

24:47.083 --> 24:49.000
Steve Berna or Luke Vezetti?

24:49.039 --> 24:53.256
- Um, the bullet?
- Gun to Christina's head.

24:55.423 --> 24:57.500
- Luke Vezetti.
- Ew, what?

24:57.616 --> 24:58.432
OK, you know what?

24:58.553 --> 25:00.884
Steve always has a yellow stain
around his armpit

25:00.930 --> 25:03.307
and then I'd have to listen
to him rank Nickelback albums.

25:03.346 --> 25:06.057
At least Luke doesn't talk much.

25:06.102 --> 25:08.808
OK, I'm gonna write
on Leigh Anne's wall.

25:08.854 --> 25:11.230
"Alyssa loves Luke."

25:11.270 --> 25:13.230
Smiley face tongue out.

25:13.276 --> 25:16.403
You bitch.
Whatever, I don't care.

25:16.442 --> 25:18.403
I'm so bored!

25:18.448 --> 25:20.529
- And kind of horny.
- Hey, Daddy.

25:22.535 --> 25:26.288
- Hey, girls. Just seeing how you're doing.
- We're fine.

25:28.958 --> 25:32.375
She sees.

25:32.420 --> 25:35.711
Mom? She sees
what you do for us.

25:37.717 --> 25:40.428
Oh, Daddy!

25:47.807 --> 25:50.769
I love you both so much.

25:50.814 --> 25:53.105
I won't be far.

25:53.145 --> 25:55.855
Can we have a gun?

25:55.901 --> 25:58.403
No, we can't have a gun.

25:58.442 --> 26:00.573
OK.

26:13.294 --> 26:15.250
OK.

26:15.296 --> 26:17.461
OK.

26:19.967 --> 26:21.923
If anything happens tonight,

26:21.969 --> 26:24.471
this is on you.
I have to do this alone.

26:24.510 --> 26:26.471
I know.

26:26.516 --> 26:29.519
God help us.

26:37.942 --> 26:40.778
- Don't go following me.
- Yeah, yeah, I won't.

27:03.048 --> 27:05.179
Hey.

27:05.221 --> 27:07.181
Everything all right?

27:07.221 --> 27:09.682
I'm in for the night
with Wharton

27:09.726 --> 27:13.519
- and the pricey stuff.
- Well, it is an occasion.

27:35.163 --> 27:39.086
- Letha?
- Morose,

27:39.130 --> 27:42.923
like a spongy cantaloupe. Won't
speak. That boy, I imagine.

27:42.962 --> 27:46.095
And who knows what his
full moon plans are.

27:46.134 --> 27:48.096
Attempt at humor.

27:48.135 --> 27:50.642
Desire to fight is zero percent.

27:50.682 --> 27:54.019
Apparently he was
attacked yesterday.

27:54.057 --> 27:56.439
Some boys beat him up after
school. She saw the whole thing.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.900
Jesus.

27:58.942 --> 28:01.192
At a time like this,
the only thing there is

28:01.231 --> 28:03.442
is to stay together.

28:03.488 --> 28:06.740
You're home. She's safe.

28:06.779 --> 28:11.326
We have so much
to be thankful for.

28:11.366 --> 28:13.327
Oh, yeah, yeah.

28:13.372 --> 28:15.913
I know.

28:15.959 --> 28:19.711
She's lucky to have you
as a father.

28:23.173 --> 28:25.718
Where is she?

28:25.759 --> 28:28.884
She's in the kitchen.

28:38.019 --> 28:41.567
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:43.567 --> 28:45.864
I'm gonna make some pasta.

28:45.903 --> 28:49.404
- Boscaiola.
- I'll go upstairs.

28:49.450 --> 28:52.115
No, stay. Me and your mom
could use the company.

28:52.161 --> 28:54.702
You mean a buffer?

28:54.747 --> 28:57.959
I'm sorry.
I'm not me right now.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.711
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

29:08.928 --> 29:12.807
I used to think there wasn't a problem
in the world you couldn't solve.

29:18.563 --> 29:21.315
You know,

29:21.355 --> 29:24.567
I wish it wasn't part
of the mythic cycle

29:24.606 --> 29:26.653
that I inevitably
disappoint you.

29:28.653 --> 29:31.784
You don't.

29:31.826 --> 29:33.826
And you couldn't.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.363
You know, maybe you want to
watch a bad movie with me later.

29:44.380 --> 29:47.798
Yeah. Maybe I will.

30:15.201 --> 30:16.826
Fuck this.

30:34.009 --> 30:37.016
Peter?

30:45.020 --> 30:48.067
Peter?

30:51.153 --> 30:53.115
I'll just be here.

30:56.576 --> 30:58.788
Is there a scent?

31:28.942 --> 31:30.736
Peter!

31:33.238 --> 31:34.949
Stay back!

31:36.115 --> 31:39.162
- What is that?
- Ketamine dart.

31:39.201 --> 31:41.288
OK, you don't understand.
You need to listen--

31:41.326 --> 31:43.582
- There's plenty more of it
if you take another step.

31:43.624 --> 31:46.919
- Listen to me...
- Do not attempt eye contact.

31:46.961 --> 31:49.047
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

31:49.086 --> 31:52.758
Do not attempt eye contact.
I will shoot you.

31:52.798 --> 31:54.719
It's not him.

32:00.016 --> 32:01.976
I said it's not him!

32:02.018 --> 32:06.269
- How do you know that?
- Because...

32:06.313 --> 32:07.980
I was with him the last time,
the whole night.

32:08.020 --> 32:10.902
You're lying.

32:10.942 --> 32:14.528
You have a tell,

32:14.568 --> 32:16.865
a wavering tremolo,
if you will,

32:16.904 --> 32:19.365
- in your voice.
- If you hurt him,

32:19.410 --> 32:22.496
- you're dead, you hear me? You're dead.
- He's fine.

32:22.538 --> 32:26.500
If you threaten me again I'll come
over there and break your teeth in.

32:30.461 --> 32:33.507
OK, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
but I'm telling you,

32:33.548 --> 32:36.928
you don't know what you're doing
right now. It's not Peter.

32:36.969 --> 32:39.346
We were tracking the vargulf.
That's why we came out here,

32:39.384 --> 32:42.516
to get the scent.

32:42.557 --> 32:45.682
Just how much of what you think
you know is what he told you?

32:45.728 --> 32:48.009
If there's another one tonight,
it's gonna be your fault.

32:48.019 --> 32:50.066
- It'll be your fault.
- Roman,

32:50.105 --> 32:53.277
what can be done
with few assumptions

32:53.317 --> 32:56.028
is done in vain with more.

32:56.068 --> 32:59.654
This is not your friend.
This is not a person.

32:59.700 --> 33:03.826
I know that's hard
for you to accept.

33:03.871 --> 33:06.373
I believe it is for him too.

33:06.413 --> 33:09.164
I believe that you came here
to find the monster.

33:09.210 --> 33:11.250
So did he.

33:11.295 --> 33:15.048
Because he can't know
that about himself.

33:15.087 --> 33:18.759
You can't know that about yourself
and continue being a person.

33:18.803 --> 33:20.971
That's bullshit.

33:21.009 --> 33:23.307
That's just bullshit.

33:23.346 --> 33:26.018
This is an animal.
That is what this is.

33:29.063 --> 33:30.894
Again, do not attempt
eye contact.

33:33.855 --> 33:37.028
Can't you see
I'm trying to help?

33:37.067 --> 33:40.904
- Why won't you let me help?
- Because you don't believe in God.

33:47.873 --> 33:51.250
Please go to your car

33:51.294 --> 33:54.375
and leave of your own volition.

33:54.421 --> 33:56.757
I'm gonna be really pissed off
if you make me shoot you.

33:56.798 --> 33:59.218
I'm not afraid of you.

34:08.268 --> 34:11.938
You hurt him and I'll kill you!
I swear to God.

34:11.980 --> 34:14.900
OK, just don't hurt him.
Just don't hurt him.

34:14.942 --> 34:17.068
Get the hell out of here.

34:17.110 --> 34:19.070
Get the hell out of here!

34:19.112 --> 34:21.157
I'll fucking find you!

34:23.159 --> 34:25.452
God doesn't want you
to be happy, Roman.

34:25.494 --> 34:27.621
He wants you to be strong.

34:54.065 --> 34:58.610
<i>I am flooded with feelings</i>
<i>that I can't share, so I write.</i>

34:58.652 --> 35:01.864
<i>Not to Uncle Norman,</i>
<i>not this time,</i>

35:01.905 --> 35:04.242
<i>because he would not understand.</i>

35:04.282 --> 35:06.409
<i>I write because I'm terrified.</i>

35:06.451 --> 35:10.248
<i>I almost lost Roman once, and</i>
<i>now he's risking himself again.</i>

35:10.289 --> 35:14.251
<i>I want to reach inside him and tear this
miserable obsession from his heart.</i>

35:14.293 --> 35:19.047
<i>But there's nothing I can do any more
than I can stop the night from falling.</i>

35:19.090 --> 35:22.260
<i>And worse, as much as I fear</i>
<i>for my brother's safety,</i>

35:22.300 --> 35:25.262
<i>even more I dread</i>
<i>my mother's response.</i>

35:53.581 --> 35:55.541
Talk to me, little mouse.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.668
Rumancek has been contained.

35:57.710 --> 35:59.588
[Outstanding.]

35:59.630 --> 36:02.672
Shall we expect
to see you shortly?

36:05.552 --> 36:07.554
Yes.

36:10.306 --> 36:14.311
Clementine, bring
the animal to us.

36:14.353 --> 36:16.480
Do not purge the beast.

36:16.521 --> 36:18.523
[Do you understand?]

36:20.525 --> 36:23.195
- Of course, sir.
- [I trust you,]

36:23.237 --> 36:26.324
- little mouse.
- [He's in sleepy town.]

36:26.364 --> 36:30.161
Make a bed.

36:42.465 --> 36:44.425
Don't worry, baby,

36:44.467 --> 36:48.179
I can save one of us.

36:51.681 --> 36:54.351
Come to my assistance
in this great need,

36:54.393 --> 36:57.146
that I may receive
the consolation

36:57.188 --> 36:59.356
and succor of heaven

36:59.398 --> 37:02.275
in all my tribulations,

37:02.318 --> 37:04.695
necessities

37:04.735 --> 37:10.409
- and sufferings.
- I wouldn't do that.

37:10.451 --> 37:13.829
I see you don't like
your privacy invaded either.

37:13.871 --> 37:15.831
Ironic,

37:15.873 --> 37:19.376
though, in fairness,
you are trespassing,

37:19.418 --> 37:22.380
and in the process of doing so,

37:22.420 --> 37:25.382
dared to threaten
the life of my son.

37:27.425 --> 37:29.387
Where I come from,

37:29.427 --> 37:31.472
it's rather frowned upon
to hunt on the grounds

37:31.514 --> 37:33.681
- of one's betters.
- Mrs. Godfrey,

37:33.724 --> 37:37.143
I'm giving you one opportunity
to turn around.

37:37.186 --> 37:39.980
If you take a step towards me,
I will kill you.

37:40.021 --> 37:43.567
The cross you wear...

37:43.608 --> 37:45.568
It's not of your order.

37:45.610 --> 37:47.695
St. Jude.

37:50.574 --> 37:52.534
St. Jude.

37:52.576 --> 37:54.119
Little mouse.

37:54.161 --> 37:56.829
Aw, little mouse.

37:56.871 --> 37:58.789
It makes you feel so lost.

38:21.271 --> 38:23.356
Christina,

38:23.398 --> 38:25.358
why aren't you answering?

38:25.400 --> 38:28.195
Seriously, sweetie.
Message, like, a hundred.

38:28.237 --> 38:31.072
- We just wanted to make sure you were OK.
- We love you!

38:31.114 --> 38:34.577
Call us back when you can, which you obviously
can because you're stuck by yourself

38:34.617 --> 38:37.704
in a mental hospital.
Call us, bitch.

38:37.746 --> 38:41.375
- Kisses.
- OK, Luke Vezetti or Tyler Lane?

38:41.416 --> 38:43.793
That scar did make
Tyler a lot hotter.

38:43.835 --> 38:46.713
Trollop! But not wrong.

38:48.547 --> 38:50.509
I have an idea.

38:50.550 --> 38:54.054
[O'Herlihey...]

38:54.096 --> 38:56.806
Waterfront's clear.

38:56.847 --> 38:59.476
[Tilson, just south
of Kilderry...]

38:59.518 --> 39:01.853
No sightings.

39:01.893 --> 39:05.356

42:53.918 --> 42:56.295
Sheriff, we, uh...

42:56.338 --> 42:58.297
we gotta know what happened.

43:14.231 --> 43:16.775
Honey... honey...

43:44.552 --> 43:47.347
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy.

43:47.389 --> 43:48.931
It's OK.

44:56.081 --> 44:58.960
I prayed.

44:59.001 --> 45:01.505
I prayed that
if it had to happen,

45:01.545 --> 45:04.507
it happened to someone else.

45:04.547 --> 45:07.719
Not her.

45:07.760 --> 45:10.972
As long as it wasn't her.

45:14.266 --> 45:16.059
It's OK.

45:23.943 --> 45:27.155
<i>You know the place.</i>

45:27.197 --> 45:30.199
I washed the blood
off, Michael.

45:30.239 --> 45:32.202
Is that right?

45:32.242 --> 45:34.954
Think I'm standing here
waiting for your opinion?

45:34.996 --> 45:37.666
Hell if I know what you do.

45:53.724 --> 45:55.809
That's a disappointment.

45:55.851 --> 45:57.811
I'm dry,

45:57.853 --> 45:59.730
almost a year.

45:59.771 --> 46:02.273
They did do that for me.

46:02.315 --> 46:04.985
Daddy's dead.

46:05.027 --> 46:08.989
They asked me to wait to tell you.
Didn't want you getting distracted.

46:11.949 --> 46:14.827
Good.

46:17.079 --> 46:20.208
- You kill him?
- No.

46:20.250 --> 46:23.085
- Don't you ever fucking lie to me, Michael.
- A man who lived like that,

46:23.126 --> 46:25.128
more satisfying to watch him
do it to himself.

46:28.382 --> 46:30.677
Amen to that.

46:30.719 --> 46:34.681
You really think God wants us to forgive
each and every one of his creations?

46:38.559 --> 46:41.186
I ain't about to start
answering that.

46:55.952 --> 46:59.414
- What are you doing?
- It's a microscope.

46:59.456 --> 47:02.583
We're gonna be late
for school.

47:22.186 --> 47:24.188
Shit.

47:32.697 --> 47:36.034
Come on.

47:39.286 --> 47:41.289
Look, there's more.

47:44.416 --> 47:46.418
There's one right there.

48:27.251 --> 48:31.338
- Wait. Maybe we shouldn't be here.
- Shut up.

48:34.550 --> 48:37.260
Ah!
