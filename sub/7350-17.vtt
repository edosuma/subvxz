WEBVTT

00:05.406 --> 00:07.241
LASALLE:
The bomb was at table 19.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.210
Seat eight.
We were at table 19.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.411
And you were seat eight.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.080
Loretta sent me
info on the bomb.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.214
There is a signature.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.715
It's the Broussard syndicate.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
The new generation.

00:15.783 --> 00:19.053
Sasha, Dante, Frank.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.254
I have spent every

00:20.288 --> 00:22.656
waking moment trying to change

00:22.690 --> 00:25.326
people's association
with my last name.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.494
Paul Jenks was my C.I.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.062
LASALLE:
How you shut down

00:28.096 --> 00:30.664
the Broussards?
He was the bait.

00:30.698 --> 00:34.102
And I needed him to
reel in the big fish.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.170
Let's talk, Baitfish.
Bomb at city park.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.572
I don't know anything.
I put you away once.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.209
If I look just a little, I'll
find a reason to send you back.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.544
They think I'm helping anyone,
let alone you, they'll cap me.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.546
I got to get out of h...

00:46.747 --> 00:49.250
I don't know who this is, but...

00:49.283 --> 00:51.385
Paul Jenks
is most probably alive.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.089
And likely the one
who bombed city park.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.367
Must input caffeine.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.104
You want some?
Sounds good.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.673
Then you hurry back.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.645
Really?

01:17.678 --> 01:19.447
Again?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.849
If you don't stop with
the excessive device checking,

01:21.882 --> 01:24.218
I won't come back.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.753
Sorry, baby.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.892
Probably should
eat something.

01:31.925 --> 01:36.164
And then maybe we could actually
leave the condo today.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.465
I know for some reason
you want us

01:37.498 --> 01:40.368
to stay inside
the whole time, but...

01:40.401 --> 01:42.370
I'd really like
to do something fun.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.172
This is fun.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.374
Something else fun.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.512
Was that a yes?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.881
Yeah...

01:53.914 --> 01:56.750
I guess you're right.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.220
We should just stay in.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.257
Freddy.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.827
Don't turn around.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.164
Be easier for both
of us that way.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.766
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:12.800 --> 02:15.403
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:15.436 --> 02:17.905
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:17.938 --> 02:19.173
* How, how, how, how

02:19.207 --> 02:21.542
* Hey, hey

02:27.381 --> 02:28.782
* You gotta come on.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.953
Hey, King,
you're not gonna believe

02:32.986 --> 02:35.956
who I ran into last night
at Francisco's.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.958
Steven Lejeune.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.628
He's still got
a limp and yes,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.363
he's still
blaming you.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.697
Pride's not here.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.199
He step out?

02:45.233 --> 02:47.235
I got here an hour ago.
Coffee wasn't on.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.303
Called his cell, no answer.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.304
You try...
Texting him? Yes.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.372
No response.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.640
This isn't like him, right?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.242
No.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.810
Straight to voice mail.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.679
You check his room?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.714
I'm not going up there.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.953
King.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.422
Feels kind of wrong
just busting in.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.293
Well, don't look at
anything personal.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.228
It's all personal.
It's his room.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.731
King, you here?

03:47.361 --> 03:48.929
What is this?

03:48.962 --> 03:50.931
That...

03:50.964 --> 03:52.700
is obsession.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.471
Back door lock
was busted.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.906
Just like
the other break-ins.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.674
Third one in a month.
Only difference:

04:00.708 --> 04:03.010
this time, burglar
surprised husband and wife.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.546
PRIDE:
Wrong on two counts.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.317
First... not husband and wife.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.884
He's Dr. Freddy Barlow.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.886
She's Pam Shore.
Second,

04:12.920 --> 04:15.356
the victims didn't
surprise the killer.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.358
He was waiting. Follow me.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.059
And who are you, exactly?

04:19.092 --> 04:22.696
Dwayne Pride, NCIS.
New Orleans office.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.768
See there.
Depressed area

04:27.801 --> 04:30.304
in the insulation means
he was here for a while.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.706
Charleston's way out of
your jurisdiction, Agent Pride.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.608
And neither one of
these victims is Navy.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.077
Well, I'm here unofficially.

04:37.110 --> 04:41.415
Pursuing a fugitive who's had
recent contact with the doctor.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.684
Oh, by the way,
I, uh, brought some coffee.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.319
Ham and egg biscuits.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.688
They're downstairs
if you want some.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.457
Wait.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.725
All due respect, you're leaning

04:51.759 --> 04:54.462
way out over your skis here,
Agent Pride.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.897
Now this here fits
a pattern of burglars

04:56.930 --> 04:59.032
breaking into homes
all up and down the coast.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.969
Burglars have a body
count before this one?

05:02.002 --> 05:03.537
No.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.105
But the condo's been ransacked.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.874
Wallet and jewelry's missing.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.709
Not to mention
the major electronics.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.844
Like I said,
fits my pattern.

05:10.878 --> 05:14.615
My fugitive probably
read the police blotter.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.485
Wanted you to make
those exact conclusions.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.387
Regardless,
I'm not letting you take over

05:19.420 --> 05:21.121
based on some
half-assed theory.

05:21.154 --> 05:26.126
And until my captain tells me
that this is no longer my case,

05:26.159 --> 05:28.028
I'd like to have
my evidence back.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.063
Oh.

05:31.432 --> 05:34.034
My officer here
will show you out.

05:34.067 --> 05:38.005
Just keep in mind, the man
I'm pursuing is dangerous.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.008
This is just a small sample
of what he's capable of.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.444
And who exactly
is this fugitive?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.914
Paul Jenks.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.149
Tried to kill me.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.084
I call him Baitfish.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.586
Baitfish?

05:52.620 --> 05:55.523
One of those individuals...

05:55.556 --> 05:58.058
that just can't seem
to stay dead.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.903
Already contacted
the federal marshals.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.507
Figured I'd let you folks
at the FBI know, too.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.009
Thank you.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.513
Put in a call to Patton.
He here yet?

06:19.547 --> 06:20.481
Haven't seen him.

06:20.514 --> 06:23.016
Tell me
when he arrives.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.151
King. You been gone

06:24.184 --> 06:25.619
for 36 hours.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.020
I told you on the phone,

06:27.054 --> 06:29.490
I'm sorry I left you
in the dark.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.692
I was in South Carolina.
Now I'm back.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.661
Has it got something to do
with the wall of crazy

06:33.694 --> 06:35.863
you got going on upstairs?
You went in my room.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.164
Which is what
you would have done

06:37.197 --> 06:39.800
if one of us would've
went off the grid.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.972
Baitfish.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.642
He's back.

06:50.210 --> 06:55.849
So I started looking into
former associates of Baitfish's,

06:55.883 --> 07:00.521
keeping an eye out for any sign
that he was active again.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.557
Lester Delrey.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.125
Former muscle for the
Broussard syndicate.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.928
I believe he was the first man
to have taken Baitfish in

07:07.961 --> 07:09.697
after he faked
his death.

07:09.730 --> 07:13.734
Lived in a shotgun shack
on Tchoupitoulas.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.504
He was found

07:16.537 --> 07:19.573
murdered in the alley
behind his place

07:19.607 --> 07:21.742
a month ago-- shot three times.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.210
NOPD said it was

07:23.243 --> 07:27.080
gang related, but...

07:27.114 --> 07:30.217
their report
noted cheap hair dye

07:30.250 --> 07:32.586
found in Lester's bathroom.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.587
Okay.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.489
Okay?

07:35.523 --> 07:36.590
So hair dye.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.626
Lester's car was stolen.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.561
Found abandoned off the highway.

07:40.594 --> 07:44.131
In the trunk, the body of...

07:46.266 --> 07:47.635
BRODY:
Brendan Harvey--

07:47.668 --> 07:49.503
served two years
for forgery.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.605
Passports and
driver's licenses.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.607
Also former syndicate.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.709
Killed by a single bullet
to the head.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.146
So Baitfish changes hair color,

07:59.179 --> 08:00.581
gets a new identity.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.016
And then, a week later,

08:03.050 --> 08:06.086
dead Brendan Harvey's
insurance

08:06.119 --> 08:09.923
gets billed for an appointment
with Dr. Freddy Barlow.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.059
Uptown orthopedist.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.194
Why would a wanted
fugitive take the time

08:14.227 --> 08:15.295
to visit
an orthopedist?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.098
Bad knee from all that running.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.767
I went to see him
two days ago.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.603
However, he didn't
show up for work.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.839
Took an abrupt
and indefinite leave.

08:25.873 --> 08:26.874
To South Carolina.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.109
I took the red-eye last night,

08:29.142 --> 08:31.545
hoping to find out
a connection.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.080
King, when exactly were you

08:33.113 --> 08:35.048
planning on letting us know
about this?

08:38.686 --> 08:40.220
Look, I'm way down
the rabbit hole.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.223
Working on a hunch.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.926
I wanted to be sure before
I dragged anyone else with me.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.261
You're sure now.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.864
It's him. It's Baitfish.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.333
Each body that I follow
leads me to another one.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.203
Baitfish is up to something.
I-I just don't know what.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.606
PATTON :
The cavalry has arrived.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.773
All right.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.675
Coming right down.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.578
Oh, before I got kicked out
of the Charleston crime scene,

09:04.612 --> 09:06.980
I had eyes
on Dr. Barlow's phone.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.650
He called a single number
about seven times

09:09.683 --> 09:11.218
in the hours before he died.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.054
Fourth Street Clinic.
Urgent care for the poor.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.188
Check out the clinic.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.690
See if it's the connection

09:16.724 --> 09:19.292
between Baitfish
and Freddy Barlow.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.361
PATTON:
Got your message.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.998
The doctor's phone SIM card?
Pride, how you get it?

09:25.032 --> 09:26.700
By my mind, that's
supposed to be property

09:26.734 --> 09:28.201
of the Charleston PD.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.203
Borrowed it.
You stole it.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.840
"Stole" implies that you have
no intention of giving it back.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.075
You say tomato,
I say stole.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.244
Yeah, you know,

09:37.277 --> 09:39.847
it's been a long time
since I seen your bad side.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.348
Me likey-like.

09:41.381 --> 09:45.052
I need everything about
Dr. Freddy Barlow.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.087
Any secrets he's got that
might link him to Baitfish.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.989
Hey, you give
me the SIM card

09:49.022 --> 09:51.024
and a pot of
Darjeeling tea,

09:51.058 --> 09:54.928
I'll suck up every piece
of dirt like a Hoover.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.364
It's one thing to have me look
into local cases already closed,

09:57.397 --> 09:59.366
but now we're
skipping jurisdictions

09:59.399 --> 10:01.635
and stealing
other men's homicides?

10:01.669 --> 10:05.005
Were you able to get Freddy
Barlow's autopsy notes?

10:05.038 --> 10:07.274
Lucky for you, I'm still
in favorable terms

10:07.307 --> 10:09.076
with the
Charleston M.E.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.012
I hear through the grapevine
that you have a conspiracy wall?

10:12.045 --> 10:13.881
No, no conspiracy
anything.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.016
Oh, you don't have to be
bashful. I got several myself.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.785
One I'm currently working
on ties the Illuminati

10:17.818 --> 10:20.187
to the owners of all 30
Major League Baseball teams.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.422
I got some extra string
if you need it.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.059
No, what I need is to connect
this murder to Paul Jenks.

10:26.093 --> 10:29.096
The Charleston M.E.
made a cursory examination,

10:29.129 --> 10:32.933
concluding that both Freddy
Barlow and Pam Shore were shot

10:32.966 --> 10:34.434
with a .22, close range.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.104
Any mention of contact
abrasions near the entry wound?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.106
No, the Charleston crime lab
found no trace evidence

10:39.139 --> 10:40.440
on the scene, but they did run

10:40.473 --> 10:42.075
ballistics on the slugs.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.977
The guns match
either of the murders?

10:44.011 --> 10:47.147
No, and there's been no hit
in NIBIN yet, either.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.917
But that doesn't mean
there's not gonna be a hit,

10:49.950 --> 10:51.418
though the chances are
slim to none.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.687
But that's...
that's still a chance, right?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.790
Why don't I go monitor
the search?

10:56.824 --> 10:57.891
Thank you.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.326
I feel as if

10:59.359 --> 11:01.762
you and I have
a new, deeper bond.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.200
You heard him, right?
No ballistic match.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.037
Baitfish must have
changed weapons.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.373
I've seen you
in this mode before.
Mode?

11:13.406 --> 11:16.977
The "nothing else matters" look,
the not sleeping, not eating.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.045
You withdraw.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.246
You shut the world out.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.480
I'm fine.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.215
No, you're not, Dwayne.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.751
Jenks.

11:23.784 --> 11:27.354
He's like a virus to you.
It's in your blood.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.922
He almost killed my daughter.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.158
Came closer with her boyfriend.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.261
I need this-- proof I'm right--

11:34.294 --> 11:37.197
so that I can find him
and end this.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.334
You get me access
to Dr. Barlow's body.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.270
If there's proof, I'll find it.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.740
Thank you... sweet Loretta.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.442
BRODY:
Excuse me.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.211
Have you seen this man
here before?

11:51.244 --> 11:52.780
Thank you.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.816
Hi. Have you seen
this man here before?

11:55.849 --> 11:58.185
Excuse me, Miss?
Don't know nothing.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.753
I didn't ask you
anything yet.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.354
Then ask.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.757
Seen this man before?

12:03.791 --> 12:05.759
Maybe changed his hair
color, style of clothes?

12:05.793 --> 12:07.260
No.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.429
Didn't even look.
Can I go now?

12:09.462 --> 12:10.330
SASHA:
What are you doing?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.434
Just asking your patients
a few questions.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.869
No, what you're doing
is scaring them off.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.138
Flashing your badges
and intimidating them.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.973
They have anything
to be afraid of?

12:20.007 --> 12:22.342
This is an urgent care
clinic for the destitute.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.478
We're here to treat them,
not interrogate them.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.549
Have you treated
this man here before?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.518
His name is Paul Jenks.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.353
Doesn't look familiar.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.322
Do you recognize
this man?

12:35.355 --> 12:38.125
That's Dr. Barlow.
He's here two days a week.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.860
Yesterday morning,
he called here seven times

12:39.893 --> 12:41.061
over the course of an hour.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.462
Was that usual?

12:42.495 --> 12:44.497
I wasn't on schedule yesterday,

12:44.531 --> 12:48.001
but it's not odd for Dr. Barlow
to check in regularly.

12:48.035 --> 12:52.205
Now, please,
tell me what happened.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.810
Dr. Freddy Barlow,
model citizen.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.879
Nothing in his life
suggests he'd cross paths

12:58.912 --> 13:00.814
with a career criminal
like Paul Jenks.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.916
Except Pride says he did.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.885
Yeah, well, "Pride says
he did" isn't reason enough

13:04.918 --> 13:07.420
for us to investigate a case
that doesn't belong to us.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.589
He stole an SD card
off a crime scene.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.458
He's negotiating the
transfer of a body

13:11.491 --> 13:12.893
that doesn't belong to us.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.427
He's got his reasons.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.829
You're telling me
you're not worried?

13:15.863 --> 13:17.865
I'm telling you, worried or not,

13:17.898 --> 13:19.332
we keep looking.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.004
Hey, Pride?
Talk to me.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.973
Man, I spent my afternoon
availing myself

13:26.006 --> 13:27.941
of Freddy's SD card.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.410
I found out that this
doctor did a poor job

13:30.443 --> 13:32.579
maintaining his
e-mail accounts.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.015
There was over 450 e-mails,

13:35.048 --> 13:37.517
a few of particular interest.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.853
"Paul Jenks is not
what he seems."

13:39.887 --> 13:43.156
"The man is using you."

13:43.190 --> 13:45.625
"Both of you need
to back off now." What...?

13:45.658 --> 13:48.595
There's your connection between
Freddy Barlow and Baitfish.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.463
Who sent the e
Nobody.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.433
Technically, a cloned phone.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.435
They're using
the account information

13:55.468 --> 13:57.270
of a bank teller in Duluth

13:57.304 --> 13:59.506
who's paying way too much
for her data plan,

13:59.539 --> 14:00.507
I might add...

14:00.540 --> 14:02.209
However...
However,

14:02.242 --> 14:05.278
the cloned phone is here
in beautiful Louisiana.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.614
It resides currently

14:07.647 --> 14:10.550
at the Federal Penitentiary
at Slidell.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.053
I can show you the cell block.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.587
Don't bother.

14:14.621 --> 14:18.458
I got a pretty good idea
who owns that phone.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.360
PRIDE:
Frank Broussard.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.896
Figured it'd be
a cold day in hell

14:22.930 --> 14:24.531
before I laid eyes on you again.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.600
Tell me about
Dr. Freddy Barlow.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.903
No clue who that is.
No?

14:29.937 --> 14:31.138
'Cause you've been

14:31.171 --> 14:33.573
sending him cryptic e-mails

14:33.606 --> 14:36.043
on this phone.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.045
C.O.s found it stuffed
inside your mattress.

14:38.078 --> 14:42.382
You've been communicating with
Dr. Barlow about Paul Jenks.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.918
Now Dr. Barlow's dead.

14:44.952 --> 14:48.021
Dead? Huh.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.090
Interesting.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.993
Gonna try to pin
that one on me, too?

14:53.026 --> 14:55.295
Just like the gala bombing.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.931
My trial starts
next month, by the way.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.700
I know that
Jenks set you up.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.702
I need your help to catch him,

15:02.735 --> 15:05.505
which will also
prove that you're

15:05.538 --> 15:07.540
mostly innocent.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.409
You gonna cut me a deal.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.712
Nothing on the bombing,
less on the drugs.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.016
I'm on the phone with the
U.S. Attorney soon as I leave.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.019
I want it in writing,
ironclad

15:19.052 --> 15:20.587
and approved by my lawyer.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.356
And then you're gonna give me

15:23.390 --> 15:26.159
everything you know
about Paul Jenks.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.695
I want him served on a platter.

15:46.079 --> 15:50.083
I'm assuming this
isn't a social call.

15:50.117 --> 15:54.187
I need to tell you something
about your cousin Frank.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.358
WOMAN:
How soon will he get out?

15:58.391 --> 15:59.993
Deal's not
worked out yet.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.295
Trading calls with
the U.S. Attorney.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.331
He'll serve some time
for the drugs, and...

16:04.364 --> 16:09.436
And the day he gets out,
he'll come for me.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.605
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.142
We'll make it
part of the deal.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.310
Can't come
within a thousand yards.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.580
You said
Frank planted that bomb.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.149
I was wrong.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.716
Jenks set the bomb.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.318
Your cousin was the patsy.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.754
Kind of feels
like I'm the patsy.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.124
But it's starting again?

16:31.158 --> 16:33.026
The Syndicate.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.228
That's what I think.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.698
Paul Jenks-- he...

16:38.731 --> 16:43.303
he wants to start up
where your family left off.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.372
I'll make sure
you're protected.
No.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.441
Uh-uh. When I separated myself
from my family,

16:48.475 --> 16:51.578
I swore
that I would lead a normal life.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.516
You've always been strong.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.552
Only way to survive
in my family.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.590
As Dwayne predicted,

17:03.623 --> 17:06.259
Freddy Barlow was
killed at close range.

17:06.293 --> 17:09.729
Note the stippling and burn
marks around the entry wound.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.298
And the diameter
is wide and misshapen.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.233
Maybe, uh, PVC pipe.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.468
And there was also debris
on the inside of the wound.

17:15.502 --> 17:19.472
Yeah, traces of, uh, newspaper,
steel wool and gaffers tape.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.443
Killer devised some kind of
sound suppressor.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.645
Just like the two other murders
Pride has connected to Baitfish.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.314
I can't say for sure
it was Baitfish,

17:27.347 --> 17:29.716
but the same man killed
all three victims.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.418
Still don't understand
why Baitfish

17:31.451 --> 17:32.585
would have killed Dr. Barlow.

17:32.619 --> 17:33.786
He was a civilian.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.722
Uh, we have a theory
about that.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.359
During my examination,
I noticed inflammation

17:39.392 --> 17:42.495
on the tissues on the inside
of the lungs and throat.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.198
It's consistent
with chemical burns.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.867
For example, Oxycodone.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.502
Was Freddy Barlow a drug addict?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.338
No. Tox screen
was clean.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.706
But he spent
a significant amount of time

17:53.740 --> 17:55.408
around drugs,
inhaling fumes.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.177
Like you might if you were in

17:57.210 --> 17:59.446
the business of manufacturing
illicit narcotics.

17:59.479 --> 18:03.416
So, if he wasn't using,
maybe he was dealing. Thanks.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.252
I'm telling Pride.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.236
Seven minutes.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.405
Excuse me?

18:27.407 --> 18:33.146
U.S. Attorney told me he'd close
the deal in 20 minutes, and...

18:33.180 --> 18:34.914
that was 13 minutes ago.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.317
I brought you
a sandwich.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.455
Been talking to Loretta, huh?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.935
Sophie Brooks was nine years
old when Baitfish killed her.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.471
That's on me. I own that.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.508
Every life he's
taken since--

19:01.541 --> 19:03.610
Herbert Walker, Allison Lacroix,

19:03.643 --> 19:06.579
Lester Delrey,
Brandon Harvey, the doctor,

19:06.613 --> 19:09.482
Pam Shore...

19:09.516 --> 19:12.252
He's a transient.
We don't even know his name.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.320
Calvin Trask.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.854
I asked Wade to

19:14.887 --> 19:17.490
forward his remains to a friend
of mine who works at the FBI lab

19:17.524 --> 19:19.659
at Quantico, specializes
in biometric analysis.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.397
I'm not Lasalle.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.367
I... You and I don't
share any kind of past,

19:27.400 --> 19:30.237
but I just want you to know
I've got your back.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.575
I know that.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.513
And I'm not leaving until
you eat half of that sandwich.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.217
You really want me
to eat something, you...

19:44.251 --> 19:46.853
go with Mortadella.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.289
Bologna is what they give you
in central booking.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.563
Five minutes early.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.831
I'm impressed.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.533
What?

20:00.567 --> 20:02.902
When?

20:06.973 --> 20:09.609
We'll be there.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.645
What is it?

20:15.448 --> 20:18.251
Frank Broussard is dead.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.690
MAN:
These incidents happen quick.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.025
Inmates on their
way to the yard.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.694
There was a commotion.
Where were the guards?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.329
Like I say,

20:29.362 --> 20:31.598
these things happen quick.
Is there a suspect?

20:31.631 --> 20:32.732
MAN:
Name's Red Carter.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.334
My men found him

20:34.367 --> 20:35.602
standing over Broussard's body.

20:38.070 --> 20:42.742
Mmm. That punk's been stepping
to me since the day he arrived.

20:42.775 --> 20:46.579
He disrespected you?
He had a mouth on him.
That don't stand in here.

20:46.613 --> 20:47.847
Well, how did Frank
disrespect you exactly?

20:47.880 --> 20:49.882
How did he
step to you?

20:49.916 --> 20:53.686
Mm. Let's just say his people
and my people don't get along.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.721
Who are his people?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.790
Aryan Brotherhood?

20:57.824 --> 21:01.027
Dixie Mafia, the Mongols,
the Low Riders?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.730
It's all the same to me.
Pale is pale.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.432
What weapon did you use?

21:05.465 --> 21:06.733
My cut.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.035
What was it?
A shiv.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.670
Which is another word for cut.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.004
What kind, Red?

21:12.038 --> 21:14.040
How'd you get it
into the yard?

21:14.073 --> 21:15.575
Did you have an accomplice?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.577
I...

21:20.079 --> 21:21.748
Not so fast.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.485
Would you like a burger,
Officer Lorna?

21:27.620 --> 21:28.921
More for me, then.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.692
I'll take them home.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.562
You know, when I got here,
I was convinced

21:35.595 --> 21:38.398
that someone had
hired you to kill Frank.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.699
I told you.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.401
The man got in my face...

21:41.434 --> 21:43.102
I saw your record.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.105
You were transferred here a
week ago from minimum security.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.108
You don't have people,
don't have a rep.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.378
Figured you'd
make your bones by confessing

21:51.411 --> 21:52.845
to a murder you didn't commit.
Mm-mm.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.815
Maybe get yourself
a free lunch.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.584
I killed that man.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.486
What weapon did you use?

22:03.890 --> 22:06.359
Sharpened toothbrush.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.599
Wrong answer, Red.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.505
Frank's killer
didn't kill Frank.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.507
False confession.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.943
I left Brody at Slidell
to find the real suspect.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.945
We're gonna
get him, King.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.947
Yeah, well, I agree with
the "gonna get him,"

22:27.980 --> 22:29.782
but I don't know about the "we."

22:29.816 --> 22:32.485
While you guys were out there
having a bonding moment,

22:32.519 --> 22:34.687
I was digging deep
into Freddy Barlow's life,

22:34.721 --> 22:36.022
looking for
a connection to drugs.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.724
And?

22:37.757 --> 22:39.692
I think I found it.
Fourth Street Clinic

22:39.726 --> 22:41.661
sees maybe
300 patients a week,

22:41.694 --> 22:43.896
but they receive shipments
of prescription drugs

22:43.930 --> 22:45.732
for a lot more than that.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.066
Lot of Oxy.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.470
Central City was
Frank Broussard's territory.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.038
He gets sent away...

22:52.071 --> 22:54.140
Leaves a vacuum in the
narcotics business.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.975
Baitfish steps in.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.578
Yeah, maybe Baitfish
makes contact with Dr. Barlow

22:58.611 --> 23:01.514
to order the Oxy
and uses the clinic for cover.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.150
Brings the Oxy in through the
front door legally, cut them,

23:04.183 --> 23:06.486
and then send it out the
back door to the dealers.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.754
We got to hit that clinic now.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.789
Let's roll.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.826
You're welcome.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.127
Huh.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.829
What?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.765
Well, that's weird.
Nobody's here.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.837
This place was jammed yesterday.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.510
They moved out
fast, huh?

23:55.735 --> 23:58.137
Put your hands up
where I can see them.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.844
NCIS!

24:10.650 --> 24:11.784
Put your hands up.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.452
Cool it, cowboy.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.857
I'm a Fed.

24:31.037 --> 24:34.674
ATF confirmed.
She checks out.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.776
Special Agent Sonja Percy.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.512
Hey, keep your voice down,
a'ight?

24:39.546 --> 24:41.681
Can we get out of here?
Feeling exposed.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.555
Feel free
to rough me up some.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.856
What?

24:49.889 --> 24:51.691
Bounce me off the door,
take a swing,

24:51.724 --> 24:54.260
go with whatever
makes it clear that you and I

24:54.293 --> 24:57.630
just plain
don't like each other.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.632
You really commit
to the role, huh?

24:59.666 --> 25:02.101
You think I ran
from you boys for my health?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.739
What the hell is NCIS
doing sniffing around

25:06.773 --> 25:08.741
the Fourth Street Clinic anyway?

25:08.775 --> 25:12.244
We think it may be
connected to a fugitive

25:12.278 --> 25:13.680
I've been hunting.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.047
Name is Paul Jenks.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.017
What's your angle
here, anyway?

25:18.050 --> 25:19.752
Gang I'm circling moves guns.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.621
Move drugs, too,
out of this place

25:21.654 --> 25:23.089
and another clinic
on 12th Street,

25:23.122 --> 25:26.025
but nothing a couple
Navy cops should care about.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.694
This guy--
what'd he do?

25:27.727 --> 25:29.896
Steal an admiral's car
or something?

25:29.929 --> 25:32.732
He killed two people
within the last three days.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.201
Body count
may be as high as six.

25:35.234 --> 25:38.204
We're trying to figure out
where he is and his next move.

25:38.237 --> 25:41.207
Seen him here once or twice.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.775
Figured he was a boss.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.711
Had a short conversation,

25:44.744 --> 25:46.846
pitched myself as a girl
who gets things done.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.849
We need to see your surveillance
and intelligence reports.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.684
Everything.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.119
I'm supposed
to help you?

25:53.152 --> 25:55.021
Cooperate, yes.

25:55.054 --> 25:59.692
"Cooperate" suggests I had
some say in what's going on.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.595
Eight months I've been
living out a crap shack.

26:02.629 --> 26:05.898
Making connects,
seeking my bona fides.

26:05.932 --> 26:09.736
Earning this gang's
trust inch by inch.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.838
Now they gone.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.840
How's the doctor play into this?

26:13.873 --> 26:15.908
Doctor had no idea
this place was a clinic by day

26:15.942 --> 26:17.343
and pill mill by night.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.879
Someone tipped him
a few days ago.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.181
Good doctor found out
his DEA number was being used

26:22.214 --> 26:23.883
to order Oxys in bulk,

26:23.916 --> 26:25.852
man was on a warpath.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.721
Frank Broussard
tipped him off.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.757
Hoping to shut Jenks down.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.359
All he managed to do was
get Freddy Barlow killed.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.628
You're gonna take my case away.

26:35.662 --> 26:36.929
You got to trust us.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.731
I ain't got to do nothing,

26:38.765 --> 26:39.832
all right?

26:39.866 --> 26:41.333
That being said,

26:41.367 --> 26:43.803
what I heard...
Jenks has got a financier.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.639
Guy named Leone.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.007
Man behind the curtain.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.009
Okay.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.411
So

26:52.444 --> 26:55.247
Do you think, uh, we're
working together on this?

26:56.382 --> 26:59.952
I think you
gonna owe me.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.921
I'm not handing over
the fruits of my labor

27:01.954 --> 27:03.890
'cause I like your haircut.

27:07.894 --> 27:10.997
Now don't mess up the order,

27:11.030 --> 27:14.300
'cause I got it organized
in a particular way.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.969
We'll treat it as if
it was our own child.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.774
I can give you a lift.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.143
Nah, I'll take public service.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.313
From here?
You don't want to do that.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.881
Look, I'll put the cuffs
back on you

27:28.915 --> 27:30.917
and you can ride in the back.

27:30.950 --> 27:34.854
Cuffs or not, I'm keeping
my distance from you, Lasalle.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.689
What's that supposed to mean?

27:36.723 --> 27:39.692
Let's just say your
reputation precedes you.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.360
My reputation?

27:41.393 --> 27:44.463
Have we had a bad date
I don't recall?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.966
No, but a friend of mine did.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.735
Billie Boutros.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.270
Okay, let me explain.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.272
She said, "Chris
Lasalle ain't nothing

27:53.305 --> 27:56.142
but a smile and a stream
of empty promises."

27:56.175 --> 27:57.944
Now, that ain't fair.
Got to wear Kevlar

27:57.977 --> 27:59.478
on your heart
around that man.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.380
Look, Billie Boutros--
I mean,

28:01.413 --> 28:02.949
can you believe
everything she says?

28:02.982 --> 28:04.216
Well, she also said

28:04.250 --> 28:06.252
when it comes to work,

28:06.285 --> 28:08.287
you're the best cop
she ever knew.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.989
First man
through the door,

28:10.022 --> 28:11.858
last one out.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.927
And the only guy you need
when a job goes sideways.

28:14.961 --> 28:17.263
Like I said,

28:17.296 --> 28:18.965
Little BB?

28:18.998 --> 28:20.900
Her word
is as good as gold.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.769
Mm.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.804
Cute.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.776
What am I looking at?

28:29.809 --> 28:31.310
The breakdown of
the various chemicals

28:31.343 --> 28:33.846
inside Freddy Barlow's
throat and lungs.

28:33.880 --> 28:34.947
Not just Oxy?

28:34.981 --> 28:36.448
No. So much more.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.017
This compound is
a mixture of Oxy

28:38.050 --> 28:40.252
and-and seven other
distinct elements.

28:40.286 --> 28:43.923
Makes it as unique a formula as
a soft drink or a special sauce.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.858
I pulled data from
area hospitals,

28:45.892 --> 28:47.860
police districts
and the DEA--

28:47.894 --> 28:50.196
drug overdoses, seizures-- and
I mapped every single occurrence

28:50.229 --> 28:52.264
of this particular
compound in the city.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.867
This drug isn't just being dealt
in the Fourth Street Clinic.

28:54.901 --> 28:55.868
It's everywhere.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.236
Undercover agent we met

28:57.269 --> 28:58.771
mentioned
the 12th Street Clinic.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.472
Can you put that
up on the map?
Yeah.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.276
It's dead center
in one of the clusters.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.078
Pull up the other free clinics.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.347
SEBASTIAN:
How's that for a conspiracy?

29:08.380 --> 29:09.916
Half a dozen free clinics
in New Orleans

29:09.949 --> 29:12.251
and all of them dealing
high quality Oxy.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.820
I am totally blogging
about this.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.889
Soon as the
case is closed.

29:16.923 --> 29:20.559
Baitfish isn't
starting an empire.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.929
Already well on his way.

29:22.962 --> 29:25.397
I have spoken to every
prisoner, corrections officer

29:25.431 --> 29:27.934
and administrator who might
have had any kind of interaction

29:27.967 --> 29:30.236
with Frank Broussard
before he died.
Any luck?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.972
Seems like Frank was killed
in the one spot in that prison

29:33.005 --> 29:34.273
where no one
could see him.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.108
Loading area with
restricted access.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.945
Inmate couldn't even be there
without a C.O. present.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.413
What's all this?
Six months of surveillance

29:41.447 --> 29:44.016
from the Fourth Street Clinic,
courtesy of ATF's

29:44.050 --> 29:46.018
lippiest undercover agent.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.854
Well, whoever did this
was thorough.

29:47.887 --> 29:49.088
I've identified
three of these guys

29:49.121 --> 29:51.090
coming out of the pill mill.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.258
Petty crooks.
Former syndicate.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.127
The other two fellas
I don't recognize.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.997
Wait a minute.
I know that guy.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.832
Just saw him
at the Slidell prison.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.100
Is he an inmate?

30:01.133 --> 30:03.435
A guard. I was sitting
across from him all day.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.304
Got a name to go
with his face?

30:05.337 --> 30:08.340
Lorna. Had access
to Frank Broussard.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.177
Maybe he drug Frank into the
restricted area of the prison,

30:11.210 --> 30:13.012
stabbed him and
then walked away.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.280
Got an address.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.016
I'm calling Pride.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.985
I got the back.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.994
Milton Lorna.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.529
Open up. Federal agents.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.112
BRODY:
Clear.

30:49.448 --> 30:50.983
Clear.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.119
Not here, King.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.455
Damn.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.625
He was recently.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.528
Looks like he's a pill head.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.631
Would explain how Baitfish
got his hooks into him.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.266
LASALLE:
I'll call NOPD,

31:07.299 --> 31:08.901
put out a BOLO.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.102
He won't get far.

31:10.136 --> 31:12.138
I know where he's going.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.618
Code four.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.256
I need to take those.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.727
Strictly protocol.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.495
There were some papers
over there.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.232
There were contracts
I was supposed to sign.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.967
Yeah, I'm afraid that's
all evidence now.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.337
Who was he?

32:51.370 --> 32:53.539
Prison guard
from Slidell.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.742
Likely he
killed Frank.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.611
And tried to kill me?

32:59.645 --> 33:01.680
He's working for Jenks.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.183
Figure Jenks has been...

33:04.216 --> 33:05.717
cleaning house.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.288
Hmm.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.357
He's been taking out
syndicate members.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.526
But I'm not a syndicate member.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.296
Well, Jenks must've figured
you knew something important.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.465
Because of you.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.035
My cousin's dead.

33:23.069 --> 33:25.304
I almost died.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.274
Ended up killing someone.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.743
No matter what I do,

33:31.777 --> 33:34.346
nothing changes.

33:34.380 --> 33:37.049
Can I go?

33:37.083 --> 33:39.751
I need to find a place
to stay tonight.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.795
What can you tell me?

33:49.828 --> 33:52.831
Sasha's a good shot,
kicked Lorna's ass.

33:52.864 --> 33:55.501
All three bullets
in one tight grouping.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.836
Good for her.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.639
Any leads on Baitfish?

34:00.672 --> 34:04.543
NOPD and DEA are checking
the other clinics.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.812
Lasalle went back to the office,
see what they came up with.

34:06.845 --> 34:07.779
Lorna's cell phone.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.715
Got a text

34:09.748 --> 34:12.384
from an unknown caller about
an hour before he showed up.

34:12.418 --> 34:15.721
It says, "Tell me
when it's done."

34:15.754 --> 34:17.256
From Baitfish?

34:18.290 --> 34:20.526
Well, what are you waiting for?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.594
Tell the man it's done.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.101
NOPD and DEA hit
the other clinics

34:29.135 --> 34:30.736
being used as
pill mills.

34:30.769 --> 34:34.473
All were cleared out, just
like the one on Fourth Street.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.642
Baitfish is on the move.
He's going underground.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.110
Well, pill mills
might be closed,

34:38.144 --> 34:39.745
but the drugs
are still out there.

34:41.447 --> 34:44.250
No text from Jenks?

34:44.283 --> 34:47.153
Man's a fugitive. Hunted.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.888
Yet he manages to set up
his own little cartel.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.424
Takes money, ground support,
intelligence.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.660
Something that he is
in short supply of.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.163
Maybe it's this partner of his
that Sonja mentioned.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.664
Leone.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.132
Which might explain
what I've learned.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.800
I've done some research.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.803
These clinics share more in
common than being drug fronts.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.372
Each one of them was set up

35:06.405 --> 35:08.440
on condemned property
after Katrina.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.609
Part of the urban renewal
and rebuilding effort

35:10.642 --> 35:11.910
by the city.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.912
Each one funded by this
real estate corporation,

35:13.945 --> 35:16.482
partnership of
various trusts.

35:16.515 --> 35:20.152
It's a maze of shell
corporations and tax shelters.

35:20.186 --> 35:23.189
Suggests that very big money
financed this operation.

35:23.222 --> 35:26.625
Baitfish-- he's the kind of guy
to have access to big money?

35:29.361 --> 35:31.497
BRODY: What does Baitfish
have to say?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.932
An address. Near the Wharfs.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.435
Let's roll him up.

35:42.508 --> 35:45.944
I count three guys.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.280
Make that four.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.216
Loading boxes.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.750
It's probably the Oxy.

35:51.783 --> 35:53.452
Any sign of Baitfish?

35:53.485 --> 35:56.222
Not that I could see, but
there's someone in the truck.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.623
When's NOPD get here?

35:57.656 --> 35:59.458
On their way now,
five to ten minutes.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.892
King, they're hauling out.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.294
We can't wait.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.363
Move now. You take the crew,
I got the truck.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.905
Hands in the air!

36:13.939 --> 36:15.541
BRODY:
Federal agents!

36:20.011 --> 36:22.848
Stay on the ground!

36:29.955 --> 36:31.590
Christopher, I heard shots.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.858
LASALLE:
Everybody's good, King.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.664
Jenks!

37:13.932 --> 37:17.803
Hands where I can
see them!

37:17.836 --> 37:19.271
Now, Jenks!

37:34.886 --> 37:36.888
Where is he?

37:36.922 --> 37:38.023
Where's Baitfish?

37:38.056 --> 37:39.491
Gone.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.393
Somebody tipped him
the heat was on.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.395
How'd you end up here?

37:43.429 --> 37:44.930
Gang I've been circling
finally circled back,

37:44.963 --> 37:46.865
offered a piece of work.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.000
And you didn't think to warn me?

37:49.034 --> 37:50.068
Didn't have time.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.805
Where you taking the pills?

37:53.839 --> 37:55.474
Someplace safe for now.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.676
Look, Pride, I'm on the inside.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.845
We can make this work.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.347
We can get him.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.981
I've known you
for, like, six seconds.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.317
Well, you gonna have
to trust me.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.555
For all we know, Baitfish
has someone inside the NOPD,

38:09.588 --> 38:11.590
has eyes on us right now.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.060
Got a gun?

38:15.093 --> 38:17.062
Yeah.
Fire a couple shots.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.730
Leave some shells behind.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.433
Don't worry, I'll miss.

38:21.467 --> 38:22.701
Appreciate that.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.002
You go right.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.704
My right?
Yeah.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.410
Lasalle, Brody.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.718
Leone.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.986
Baitfish's partner?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.154
Sort of.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.123
It's Italian for "lion."

39:18.156 --> 39:22.694
All these clinics bankrolled
by a charitable trust.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.797
Follow the money back,
you'll find a shell corporation

39:25.831 --> 39:28.700
in the Caymans--
the Latendale Group.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.101
Insignia's...

39:30.135 --> 39:33.104
a lion's head.

39:33.138 --> 39:37.075
The Latendale group's
only shareholder...

39:40.712 --> 39:43.014
...is Sasha Broussard.

40:00.566 --> 40:03.068
Got your message.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.437
You gonna pick her up

40:08.474 --> 40:11.076
I don't have enough.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.944
Yet.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.013
I grab her now,
she'll lawyer up,

40:15.046 --> 40:16.482
and then she'll walk.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.520
You should order something.

40:21.553 --> 40:22.854
Oh, you kidding?

40:22.888 --> 40:24.122
I'm vegan.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.627
Hey, a girl's allowed to be
complex, isn't she?

40:28.660 --> 40:30.796
You should eat, though.

40:33.799 --> 40:36.201
You heard from Baitfish?

40:36.234 --> 40:37.769
I will.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.170
He's hobbled.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.973
My guess, he saw
the walls closing in,

40:42.007 --> 40:43.775
started cleaning up people,

40:43.809 --> 40:47.045
including his
partner, Sasha.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.714
I want them both.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.181
Rock solid evidence.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.951
Arrests, convictions...

40:52.984 --> 40:55.120
life-long prison sentences.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.756
I'll be in touch.
Soon.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.737
* Time passes *

41:11.770 --> 41:16.174
* You learn right
from wrong... *

41:19.110 --> 41:21.813
MAN:
Should've let Jenks burn.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.149
SASHA: They arrest him,
he gives them us.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.519
I didn't have a choice
but to warn him.

41:27.553 --> 41:29.287
Mm.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.256
Are you coming out here
anytime soon?

41:31.289 --> 41:33.892
'Cause it feels like
I am talking to a wall.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.861
Just making
myself pretty.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.965
You're pretty enough.

41:39.998 --> 41:43.268
* You make your own heaven
and hell... *
