WEBVTT

00:30.905 --> 00:32.615
- Thanks, Bibbo.
- Mm-hm.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.128
Superman, we need to talk.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.590
I think you're
a little confused.

00:50.550 --> 00:55.346
We're not confused,
but we do need your help.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.431
Poseidonis needs us.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.726
Annax Orin.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.186
- Anything?
- No.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.730
We have found neither foot
nor fin of Ocean-Master.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.689
Apologies.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.691
No apologies necessary.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.277
Orm has always been
a slippery fish.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.364
And I am aware
Black Lightning has
twice pulled you away

01:54.364 --> 01:56.825
to lead missions
for the League.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.744
Much of this
still makes little sense to me.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.705
Ocean-Master,
both before and after

02:02.789 --> 02:04.040
he was revealed as my brother,

02:04.040 --> 02:06.417
always had a method
to his madness.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.754
He was never about sowing chaos
for chaos' sake.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.966
What did he truly hope to gain
from his attack?

02:12.966 --> 02:15.051
He had to know that
even in success,

02:15.051 --> 02:17.470
Atlantis would never have
accepted him as king.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.682
Perhaps, after six years
in an Atlantean prison

02:20.682 --> 02:22.225
he simply wanted vengeance.

02:22.225 --> 02:26.604
But then, why wait so long
to take it?

02:26.688 --> 02:28.064
And your report, La'gaan?

02:28.064 --> 02:30.233
I wish I had
better news, Annax.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.486
There's unrest
in nearly every city-state,
particularly in...

02:33.570 --> 02:34.696
Xebel.

02:34.696 --> 02:38.199
Yes, incited by
Xebel's own King Nereus,

02:38.283 --> 02:42.495
mass demonstrations,
protest... well, this.

02:42.579 --> 02:45.373
Poseidonis' needs
seem to supersede

02:45.373 --> 02:47.333
those of
the other seven principalities.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.669
Our resources may be
stretched thin,

02:49.669 --> 02:52.505
but we could not
leave Poseidonis in ruins.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.215
For the pride of Atlantis,

02:54.299 --> 02:56.092
Orm cannot be seen to have won.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.552
And the funds for these repairs

02:57.552 --> 02:59.470
came from
Poseidonis' own General Fund,

02:59.554 --> 03:01.431
not from
the Atlantean Treasury.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.182
But with respect, My King,

03:03.266 --> 03:05.768
this is not how the people
perceive the decision.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.771
Ah, yes, perception.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.441
When I was Aquaman,
everyone complained

03:11.441 --> 03:13.610
my focus was not on Atlantis.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.570
Now that it is my sole concern,

03:15.570 --> 03:17.947
no one is ever satisfied with
my decisions.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.159
Heavy the head that wears the crown.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.411
I knew you would understand,
Kaldur'ahm.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.422
Whoa!

03:41.346 --> 03:44.432
Well, Ghosty, we've covered
a lot of ground,

03:44.432 --> 03:48.102
and have gotten
exactly nowhere.

03:48.186 --> 03:52.565
I'm still hoping
this heat trail
leads us to something.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.984
Anyway, what choice do we have?

03:55.068 --> 03:58.446
You know, besides admitting
we're actually dead.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.249
Ma'al, ma'al, ma'al!

04:10.333 --> 04:12.001
This is never gonna work.

04:21.594 --> 04:26.975
Husband, rumors ride
the currents
of every city-state

04:26.975 --> 04:29.060
concerning
the mysterious stranger

04:29.060 --> 04:32.397
with the power to defeat
Neptune's Trident.

04:32.397 --> 04:36.067
It all fits the Prophecy of
the One True King.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.403
An enemy attacked
and was driven away.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.571
How many times
has that happened before?

04:40.655 --> 04:43.408
Even against Ocean-Master
and the Trident?

04:43.408 --> 04:44.826
Yes, we had help,

04:44.826 --> 04:47.328
but that hardly fulfills
any prophecies.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.999
Whether it does or does not
will hardly stop the rumors.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.584
Perception.

04:53.668 --> 04:57.255
All right.
What are the exact words
of this Prophecy?

04:57.255 --> 05:00.383
Show me the
Tablet of the Widowhood

05:00.383 --> 05:03.094
and the Prophecy of
the One True King.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.726
"Do seek Atlantis' Savior when,

05:09.726 --> 05:12.520
The Labors Three are done,
and then,

05:12.520 --> 05:15.565
We crown our King,
the One, the True,

05:15.565 --> 05:18.401
And celebrate as all renew.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.862
<i>The Stranger come from
out our past</i>

05:20.862 --> 05:24.115
<i>To quell the Trident's threat
at last...</i>

05:24.115 --> 05:26.242
<i>Shall herald Seas
that bring Red Death,</i>

05:26.242 --> 05:29.704
<i>But Three will rise,
restoring breath.</i>

05:29.704 --> 05:33.499
<i>When best of these
gains Arion's Crown,</i>

05:33.583 --> 05:36.586
<i>Our One True King
revives renown.</i>

05:36.586 --> 05:40.298
Anoint this King,
the One, the True,

05:40.298 --> 05:43.509
And celebrate as all renew."

05:45.261 --> 05:49.557
So the first condition
of the Prophecy
seems to have been met,

05:49.557 --> 05:52.101
perhaps, too perfectly.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.187
Is it possible
Orm threw the fight

05:54.187 --> 05:56.731
to make a hero
out of his conqueror?

05:56.731 --> 05:59.609
That kind of manipulation,
at least, is more his style.

05:59.609 --> 06:05.073
Possibly, though the stranger
did have real magic,
real power.

06:05.073 --> 06:09.994
Another reason why we must
find them both,
my brother and the stranger.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.872
Until now, the priority
has been to repair the city

06:12.872 --> 06:15.708
and capture Orm,
but gather the Widowhood,

06:15.792 --> 06:19.545
make the search
for 'our savior'
their top priority.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.713
I will see to it.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.477
Delphis, I am certain

06:34.477 --> 06:38.397
the families displaced by
Ocean-Master's attack
appreciate your help.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.483
I am not certain you understand

06:40.483 --> 06:42.318
how much I value
the opportunity

06:42.318 --> 06:46.072
to be offering help to someone
other than myself.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.241
That has not been my history.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.909
Then you are
welcome to stay,

06:49.909 --> 06:52.411
helping for
as long as you wish.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.539
Oh, thank you, Kaldur.

06:54.539 --> 06:58.334
Um, could you please call
your parents?

06:58.334 --> 07:00.378
They do not want to
be a bother,

07:00.378 --> 07:02.421
but they are very worried
about you.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.674
Yes, of course.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.634
We shall give you some privacy.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.433
<i>- Kaldur.</i>
- Hello.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.185
<i>Calvin, it's Kaldur.</i>

07:16.269 --> 07:17.603
- I hope you are both well.
- <i>We are.</i>

07:17.687 --> 07:19.272
<i>And very glad you called.</i>

07:19.272 --> 07:21.399
<i>For which, I assume,
we have Delphis to thank.</i>

07:21.399 --> 07:23.651
I would have called on my own.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.946
<i>Eventually,
but thank you.</i>

07:26.946 --> 07:30.032
<i>The truth is, son,
we're worried about you.</i>

07:30.116 --> 07:32.034
<i>Wyynde tell us you've been
hunting Ocean-Master</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:34.078
<i>in between missions for
the Justice League.</i>

07:34.162 --> 07:36.706
<i>While still trying to mourn
your friend Conner.</i>

07:36.706 --> 07:38.541
<i>We have talked about this.</i>

07:38.541 --> 07:40.168
<i>You take on too much.</i>

07:40.168 --> 07:43.212
Yes, we have talked about this.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.797
I only do what must be done.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.717
<i>You do more than that.
You always have,</i>

07:47.717 --> 07:49.594
<i>ever since you were a child.</i>

07:49.594 --> 07:52.638
As a child,
I learned to be responsible
from the both of you.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.559
<i>- Oh...
- You learned to be responsible because of us, certainly.</i>

07:56.559 --> 07:59.312
<i>But we were anything
but good role models
of that virtue.</i>

07:59.312 --> 08:01.606
Stop, you were
wonderful parents.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.650
<i>We gave you love, always.</i>

08:04.734 --> 08:08.571
<i>And maybe that was the best
and most important gift
we could have given you.</i>

08:08.571 --> 08:10.072
<i>But you forget how it was.</i>

08:11.199 --> 08:12.658
<i>I was never home.</i>

08:12.742 --> 08:14.911
<i>I was always leaving you alone
with your mother.</i>

08:14.911 --> 08:17.163
<i>And I was
suffering from depression.</i>

08:17.163 --> 08:19.790
<i>There were days
I could not leave our home.</i>

08:19.874 --> 08:22.251
<i>You were my little soldier,
parenting me.</i>

08:22.335 --> 08:24.337
<i>You overstate things.</i>

08:24.337 --> 08:27.798
<i>No, but it is
sweet you remember
hard times fondly.</i>

08:27.882 --> 08:31.719
<i>You took odd jobs
when I could find no work
anywhere in Shayeris,</i>

08:31.719 --> 08:34.430
<i>except with
Krush's criminal gang.</i>

08:34.514 --> 08:36.599
<i>We eventually got
our acts together.</i>

08:36.599 --> 08:39.727
<i>Your mother sought help,
I found my way.</i>

08:39.727 --> 08:41.270
<i>But the pattern was set.</i>

08:41.354 --> 08:43.731
<i>Military training,
sorcery school,</i>

08:43.731 --> 08:45.942
<i>becoming protege to the King.</i>

08:45.942 --> 08:49.445
<i>Kaldur, you have always been
the adult in the room.</i>

08:49.445 --> 08:52.531
<i>You need to take time
to just be you.</i>

08:53.491 --> 08:56.118
No, not until Orm is captured.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.663
He is too great a threat to Atlantis.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.456
- Kaldur... You need to see this.
- Huh?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.625
Mother, Father, I have to go.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.919
<i>- Of course.
- We will talk again soon.</i>

09:21.227 --> 09:24.105
My friend Clark said
you wanted to see me.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.315
Um, okay.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.985
Thank Clark for us?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.778
Look, we have a lot
to explain.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.114
It would help if you'd allow me
to telepathically link...

09:33.114 --> 09:35.658
No. We talk with words.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.244
I don't know you well enough to
give you access to my mind.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.413
Fine, we are from the future.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.207
We came back to your era
to prevent a disaster.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.084
The death of Superboy.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.253
We did
save his life outside the U.N.
a year ago,

09:47.253 --> 09:48.671
and no one knew,

09:48.671 --> 09:53.301
But on Mars... we failed.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.594
We can't tell you
how sorry we are.

09:55.678 --> 09:56.846
We really can't.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.432
If what you say is true,

09:59.432 --> 10:02.184
why not go back in time
and try again?

10:03.686 --> 10:05.521
<i>Our Time-Sphere
was destroyed.</i>

10:05.521 --> 10:07.106
<i>We're stranded here now.</i>

10:07.106 --> 10:08.607
<i>Just the two of you?</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:10.776
<i>There were
three of us,</i>

10:10.860 --> 10:14.155
<i>but we lost our friend
in the same explosion
that killed Superboy.</i>

10:14.155 --> 10:18.451
<i>I saw no evidence
of a second fatality.</i>

10:18.451 --> 10:20.286
<i>Neither did we.</i>

10:20.286 --> 10:24.540
But the last time we saw her,
she was flying to save Superboy.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.709
And she never came back to us.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.921
Eventually, we were
forced to conclude

10:31.005 --> 10:33.632
she hadn't made it.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.217
I'm so sorry.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.596
But, if you lost
your Time-Sphere,

10:38.596 --> 10:40.473
how did you get here
from Mars?

10:40.473 --> 10:43.642
- We asked for help and she said yes.
- She?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.652
Thank you
for the warning, Nimue.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.794
We haven't much time.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.776
Mother of Goat,
Conner, get it together.

11:33.776 --> 11:37.154
You have to believe
to touch anything.
You know that!

11:45.287 --> 11:47.081
No!

11:53.462 --> 11:54.839
- Mera, what--
- Listen.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.384
A new Chaos Lord was here.
Worse than Klarion.

11:58.384 --> 12:02.388
She created
this pillar of fire,
the source of these red waters.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.182
Anything the red touches, dies.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.028
I have warned the sea life
to steer clear.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.906
High King Orin,
to all city-states,

12:20.990 --> 12:22.491
this is a priority alert.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.619
Stay away from Poseidonis
and the red water.

12:25.703 --> 12:29.373
If you are within
Poseidonis' dome, stay inside.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.875
Do not open the portals,

12:30.875 --> 12:33.043
<i>or allow any Atlanteans
to exit.</i>

12:33.127 --> 12:34.670
<i>That is an order.</i>

12:34.670 --> 12:36.172
- But...
- Understood.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.636
No!

12:42.720 --> 12:45.389
I can't maintain our protection
and my construct.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.142
- Kaldur, take over the sphere.
- Yes, My Queen.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.733
- What can I do?
- Exactly what you have been.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.526
So, crowd control.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.737
Blubber!

13:01.322 --> 13:03.449
Help!

13:03.449 --> 13:05.534
He's my best friend. I...

13:05.618 --> 13:08.704
You cannot. The Red would
breach the dome,
dooming us all.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.289
Help!

13:10.289 --> 13:12.041
You must get me beyond the Red.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.383
Clear.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.058
- Huh? King Orin?
- Hold on.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.237
You should have led
with Bio-Ship.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.781
She's a darn good
character reference.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.782
What do you need?

13:44.782 --> 13:46.408
You have to understand,

13:46.492 --> 13:50.246
Superboy was
a great inspiration to us.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.581
With him dead, your future,

13:52.665 --> 13:56.085
our present is
a galactic disaster.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.255
So, we need you to
take his place

13:59.255 --> 14:01.257
at a crucial moment in time.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.260
We need you to be in
Happy Harbor, Rhode Island,

14:04.260 --> 14:07.596
ten years from today,
at 12 noon exactly.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.557
And do what?

14:09.557 --> 14:12.601
As Legionnaires,
we have often asked ourselves
the question Superboy asked.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.853
"What would Superman do?"

14:14.937 --> 14:18.399
So, when the time comes,
ask yourself,

14:18.399 --> 14:20.776
"What would Superboy do?"

14:20.776 --> 14:22.695
That's all
we can ask, or reveal.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.991
I can do that,
or try, at least.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.450
But what about the two of you?

14:28.534 --> 14:31.161
It's best we don't tell you.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.289
The timestream's fragile.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.375
We're taking
a huge risk saying this much.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.670
And you can't tell anyone
about us,

14:39.670 --> 14:42.506
or Bio-Ship or anything.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.509
So, please, get on board,

14:45.593 --> 14:47.303
so we can get out of the way.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.971
<i>Black Lightning
to Superman,</i>

14:48.971 --> 14:50.848
<i>we're facing a global
mystic crisis.</i>

14:50.848 --> 14:52.850
<i>I need you in Agra
at the Taj Mahal.</i>

14:52.850 --> 14:56.645
On my way. I have to go.
Good luck.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.730
To us all.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.326
Getting Superman to
take Superboy's place

15:10.326 --> 15:11.994
should have fixed everything,

15:11.994 --> 15:13.829
given us an instant reset.

15:13.829 --> 15:16.165
So clearly Superman failed.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.751
Didn't make it to Happy Harbor
or something.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.252
You don't know that.

15:20.336 --> 15:24.006
After multiple dousings
of Chronoton Radiation,

15:24.006 --> 15:27.009
we may be so far outside
our original timeline,

15:27.009 --> 15:30.387
we may never know
if we fixed things or not.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.014
All we can do is keep trying.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.851
Get Blubber inside
and seal the dome.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.896
- As you command.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.404
Careful, brother.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.531
I cannot believe even you would
capitalize on this calamity

15:49.615 --> 15:50.824
for your own ends.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.035
Then, for once,
you are right, Orin.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.371
I have, in fact, come to help.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.290
After all, who wants to be
master of a dead ocean?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.001
Now, hadn't you better retreat?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.337
Re-entering Poseidonis
is impossible,

16:03.337 --> 16:07.466
and I certainly have
no intention of saving
your worthless skin.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.566
Together, then!

16:24.650 --> 16:26.318
Agreed.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.080
My Queen, what will
Ocean-Master do

16:38.080 --> 16:39.164
should you both succeed?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.375
Try to kill us, probably.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.919
But one crisis at a time.

16:47.381 --> 16:50.426
Still it resists.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.209
Ghosty, you're all right.

17:24.293 --> 17:28.380
Ugh, why am I the only thing
that's solid to this creature?

17:32.718 --> 17:35.053
It's attracted to my rage?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.567
[Wolf grunts and Sphere beeps

18:14.218 --> 18:17.805
Phew! Well, we survived
the monster.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.933
But obviously,
it's pointless following
that thing's heat trail,

18:20.933 --> 18:23.560
so, now what?

18:25.604 --> 18:28.065
What am I gonna do?

18:29.274 --> 18:34.238
M'gann,
what am I gonna do?

18:45.791 --> 18:47.918
Suppression beams!

18:47.918 --> 18:51.255
With everything we have!

18:51.255 --> 18:54.091
<i>Do seek Atlantis' Savior when</i>

18:54.091 --> 18:56.844
<i>The Labors Three are done,
and then,</i>

18:56.844 --> 18:59.596
<i>We crown our King,
the One, the True,</i>

18:59.680 --> 19:02.683
<i>And celebrate as all renew.</i>

19:02.683 --> 19:05.227
<i>The Stranger come
from out our past</i>

19:05.227 --> 19:07.729
<i>To quell the Trident's threat
at last.</i>

19:07.813 --> 19:10.399
<i>Shall herald Seas
that bring Red Death,</i>

19:10.399 --> 19:14.194
<i>But Three will rise,
restoring breath.</i>

19:14.278 --> 19:17.656
<i>When best of these
gains Arion's Crown,</i>

19:17.656 --> 19:21.118
<i>Our One True King
revives renown.</i>

19:21.118 --> 19:24.454
<i>Anoint this King,
the One, the True,</i>

19:24.538 --> 19:27.291
<i>And celebrate as all renew.</i>

19:29.126 --> 19:32.462
Neptune's Beard. The Prophecy.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.381
Prophecy?

19:34.381 --> 19:38.802
Prophecy.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.579
The Prophecy.

20:06.872 --> 20:07.915
Delphis, stay here.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.338
Fool! You think to
thwart me again?

20:26.099 --> 20:27.309
No!

20:27.309 --> 20:31.146
Orm of Poseidonis,
you are under arrest!

20:31.230 --> 20:34.733
No. Not again. Never again!

20:39.488 --> 20:41.698
Gotcha.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.245
Take him away.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.830
Our pleasure, Annax.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.459
You will regret this, brother.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.295
Delphis, is he...

20:55.379 --> 20:59.299
Kaldur'ahm will be all right.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.302
- And the queen?
- I am fine, Husband.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.221
Or will be.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.897
- Here.
- Wait.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.567
You have saved us twice.
Who are you?

21:17.651 --> 21:20.570
Merely a wanderer.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.615
Happy to have been of service
to the Crown.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.283
But what is your name?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.619
I doubt you would have
heard of me.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.538
Nevertheless, we want to thank
and honor you.

21:29.538 --> 21:33.208
Unnecessary. I neither need
nor want such things.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.878
Please?

21:36.962 --> 21:41.383
In days gone by,
I was called Arion.

21:41.383 --> 21:45.512
Arion? Arion, Lord of Atlantis?

21:45.512 --> 21:49.266
Arion, the Founder of Atlantis?

21:49.266 --> 21:52.894
Arion, the Failure of Atlantis.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.605
Did you hear that?
What did he say?

21:56.523 --> 22:00.068
Arion, Arion, Arion.

22:00.152 --> 22:05.073
Arion, Arion.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.702
Um, who is this Arion?

22:08.702 --> 22:12.748
The answer, perhaps,
to an ancient question.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.418
Said answer thus raising
a thousand questions more.

22:16.418 --> 22:20.922
Arion, Arion, Arion!

22:35.437 --> 22:38.482
Kid Flash,
we need to talk.

22:46.448 --> 22:51.328
No, I think not.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.623
Though the crisis with Child
has passed,

22:54.623 --> 22:58.126
I believe we should leave
our valued assets here,

22:58.210 --> 23:01.797
where they may be kept safe
against the next crisis.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.299
Inevitably, another one

23:04.299 --> 23:06.968
always seems to be
coming down the pike.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.307
Have Psimon confirm that
the Psy-Backs are all intact.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.976
Update the inventory.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.603
Then seal this chamber,

23:16.603 --> 23:20.649
making certain I have
the only key.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.526
And be quick about it.

23:22.526 --> 23:26.655
Our focus must turn to
Project Thrinos.

23:26.655 --> 23:30.951
As of now,
it is our sole priority.
