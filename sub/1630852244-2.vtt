<i>Episode 2</i>

00:51.430 --> 00:55.600
Get the list of all the guests who were present,

00:55.600 --> 01:02.220
and gather up all the CCTV and black boxes from parked vehicles

01:02.220 --> 01:04.769
within the complex.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.890
The day that should have been their happiest became their hell.

01:09.890 --> 01:13.970
There must have been a lot of people around. The crime was boldly carried out.

01:13.970 --> 01:20.970
There are as many loathing and secrets as there are people.

01:22.910 --> 01:26.890
I thought they were especially fated by the heavens.

01:26.890 --> 01:31.720
It turns out it was an ill-fated destiny where they should have never met each other. A horrible one at that.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.480
You know how if you button up the first one wrong

01:34.480 --> 01:37.310
it messes up the entire fit of the shirt?

01:37.310 --> 01:42.240
Fate or whatever, it was wrong from the first button.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.290
Beautiful and splendid show window...

01:45.290 --> 01:51.050
It's open for everyone to see, but once the spotlights go out and the curtains are drawn,

01:51.050 --> 01:54.280
no one can ever know

01:54.280 --> 01:56.760
what's really going on.

02:29.030 --> 02:34.060
<i>Show Window: The Queen's House</i>

03:38.790 --> 03:40.490
<i>Manjestic</i>

04:23.150 --> 04:25.750
Wasn't it an excellent choice?

04:25.750 --> 04:30.970
It'll be comfortable for you, and I can see you more often, too.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.670
I like that it gives us more time.

04:32.670 --> 04:37.000
Your house is that townhouse over there, right?

04:41.320 --> 04:43.010
I should get going.

04:44.850 --> 04:46.570
See you later.

05:06.010 --> 05:10.280
<i>Queen's Club</i>

05:34.830 --> 05:36.870
Seon Joo.

05:36.870 --> 05:41.440
Do you get treatment somewhere else besides here?

05:41.440 --> 05:45.120
Right? Lately,

05:45.120 --> 05:47.550
I'm worried because I keep gaining in my midsection.

05:47.550 --> 05:50.290
How do you maintain your weight?

05:50.290 --> 05:53.130
Seriously... what do you mean?

05:53.130 --> 05:55.260
She doesn't need to maintain anything!

05:55.260 --> 06:01.330
There's a reason why her husband treats her like a queen.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.010
Who's that?

06:12.010 --> 06:14.070
I've never seen her before.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.000
Excuse me for a minute.

06:37.510 --> 06:39.470
Mi Ra?

06:43.060 --> 06:45.150
Han Seon Joo?

06:48.920 --> 06:51.510
I can't believe I'm running into you here. It's so nice to see you again.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.560
I guess we were fated after all.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.820
I think so. A special fate.

06:58.410 --> 07:01.500
Last time, I made so many mistakes.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.480
Oh right! Let me pay you back.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.060
- Oh, it's fine.
- Still. I won't feel comfortable otherwise.

07:08.060 --> 07:12.440
Then instead, buy me dinner when you have time.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.930
Should I do that then?

07:13.930 --> 07:18.160
Okay. I'll take you somewhere really nice.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.950
I won't forget to bring my wallet that day.

07:22.950 --> 07:24.390
Okay.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.650
As you can see, the current sales numbers

07:30.650 --> 07:32.810
have shot up rapidly.

07:32.810 --> 07:35.960
After the launching show, our fashion brand Victoria,

07:35.960 --> 07:39.060
has taken the spot as our representative brand

07:39.060 --> 07:42.280
even though many were concerned.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.130
Executive Director Shin.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.570
Yes.

07:45.570 --> 07:49.150
Does this seem easy to you?

07:52.260 --> 07:54.750
The path to this place right here

07:54.750 --> 07:58.130
is so difficult and trying that every time you take another step up,

07:58.130 --> 08:00.990
your knees feel like they're going to buckle.

08:00.990 --> 08:06.230
Positioning? Not so fast.

08:06.230 --> 08:08.590
Don't be conceited,

08:08.590 --> 08:11.940
and learn first to be humble and modest.

08:16.550 --> 08:17.990
Yes, ma'am.

08:20.340 --> 08:22.340
Look at your amazing skin.

08:22.340 --> 08:23.980
- So pretty!
- Yes, very.

08:23.980 --> 08:27.170
It's nice to be young.

08:27.170 --> 08:29.590
How long have you been a member of Queen's Club?

08:29.590 --> 08:33.169
- I registered last week.
- Where do you live?

08:34.760 --> 08:37.159
I have an apartment nearby.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.770
I moved in last week.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.470
That's so great.

08:41.470 --> 08:44.820
Let's meet up often then.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.450
Hold on...

08:47.730 --> 08:52.080
Isn't that a limited edition bag?

08:53.390 --> 08:55.460
- Y- yes.
- Yeah? Let me see.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.780
- Let us see!
- It is!

08:57.780 --> 08:59.310
Really?

08:59.310 --> 09:02.430
It's the same one I have. Where did you get it?

09:02.430 --> 09:04.330
Paris? Milan?

09:04.330 --> 09:06.700
I got it in Paris.

09:06.700 --> 09:10.260
Did you get it in that luxury brand store on Champs-Élysées?

09:10.260 --> 09:13.810
I got it as a gift from my boyfriend.

09:15.490 --> 09:17.980
Are you free today? Do you want to have dinner together?

09:17.980 --> 09:20.630
I still need to unpack and organize since I just moved.

09:20.630 --> 09:22.850
I don't think I can today.

09:23.610 --> 09:26.470
Okay then. Let's meet next time.

09:26.470 --> 09:29.330
Since we'll keep running into each other from now on.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.130
<i>My Lovely Brother</i>

09:35.390 --> 09:40.020
Jung Won! You usually never call? What's the ocassion?

09:41.580 --> 09:43.060
What are you talking about?

09:43.060 --> 09:45.120
I think they made a double contract.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.810
The Shanghai department store saw this as a huge issue,

09:47.810 --> 09:49.990
- and wants to reconsider the entrance to the store-
- Not that.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.540
What's the real loss because of the issue?

09:51.540 --> 09:54.780
The company that was double contracted

09:54.780 --> 09:56.570
is a rival to the Shanghai department store.

10:03.420 --> 10:07.430
Yes, Chief Han, how is it going over there?

10:08.400 --> 10:11.580
Okay. I'm going into the meeting, so hurry it up.

10:11.580 --> 10:13.630
Connect the call by video, too.

10:17.990 --> 10:21.180
Executive Director Shin, what exactly is going on?

10:21.180 --> 10:24.100
Double contract?

10:24.100 --> 10:28.360
You told me you signed an exclusive contract with us.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.090
Now we'll have to cancel

10:31.090 --> 10:34.360
every single item

10:34.360 --> 10:37.700
our department has been promoting.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.310
This is a huge loss for us!

10:39.310 --> 10:42.500
I know what your concern is.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.560
The representative of the leather company in Milan,

10:44.560 --> 10:46.690
President Carlos Pegero is on with us

10:46.690 --> 10:48.490
via video call,

10:48.490 --> 10:50.920
so please speak to him directly.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.670
Okay.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.260
He says that the double contract issue

11:03.260 --> 11:05.210
was a mistake that

11:05.210 --> 11:07.860
the president's son made.

11:07.860 --> 11:11.820
Therefore, he believes

11:11.820 --> 11:13.280
Milan is fully responsible

11:13.280 --> 11:15.210
and promises to

11:15.210 --> 11:17.700
take care of the issue completely.

11:28.890 --> 11:30.850
It got resolved.

11:30.850 --> 11:32.830
All the issues over the double contract

11:32.830 --> 11:35.030
Milan company will take full responsibility.

11:35.030 --> 11:37.970
We resolved all misunderstanding with Shanghai, too.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.020
Chief Han played a huge role in this matter.

11:44.020 --> 11:46.580
He went to see the honorary President Carlos

11:46.580 --> 11:48.750
and had it out with him.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.610
Had it out?

11:51.750 --> 11:54.840
He had that kind of courage?

12:21.100 --> 12:23.910
Thank you!

12:41.770 --> 12:45.140
- Jung Won.
- Did you clean up everything well, Executive Director?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.030
Executive Director, my foot...

12:47.030 --> 12:48.400
Let's just be comfortable.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.250
You worked hard, brother-in-law.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.130
I always felt this way,

12:52.130 --> 12:53.840
but you're the best. Really.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.500
You're the one who worked hard. Great job.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.800
The president complimented you, too.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.240
Really?

13:00.240 --> 13:02.870
She complimented me?

13:02.870 --> 13:04.320
Of course!

13:04.320 --> 13:06.590
Oh, when are you coming back to Korea?

13:06.590 --> 13:08.320
Your sister really misses you.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.930
I'm actually thinking about returning soon.

13:10.930 --> 13:13.270
You're welcome anytime.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.520
When you come,

13:14.520 --> 13:18.250
don't forget to bring the wine your sister loves.

13:18.740 --> 13:22.450
You're still the same. Only caring about my sister.

13:23.190 --> 13:26.200
Start caring for yourself, too.

13:26.990 --> 13:29.050
I'll see you soon then.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.370
- Yes, sir.
- Secretary Kang.

13:40.370 --> 13:42.490
Tell Driver Yang to go home early.

13:42.490 --> 13:45.490
- But leave the car.
- Yes, sir.

14:02.330 --> 14:05.710
The scheduling teacher is picking me up from tomorrow, right?

14:05.710 --> 14:09.580
She'll handle everything for you and your brother.

14:11.410 --> 14:12.900
<i>My Lovely Brother</i>

14:16.460 --> 14:18.250
Jung Won!

14:18.250 --> 14:20.660
Noona. Like you said,

14:20.660 --> 14:22.980
it was a good thing I met with President Carlos first.

14:22.980 --> 14:26.590
It's because you did well that everything got resolved.

14:26.590 --> 14:28.890
- Uncle, ciao!
- Oh, my niece!

14:28.890 --> 14:30.530
Hi, hi!

14:30.530 --> 14:32.410
He said, "hi, hi".

14:32.410 --> 14:35.030
Wow, that's so dated.

14:35.030 --> 14:39.100
Noona. I think I'm flying back next month sometime.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.660
Really? That's great.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.720
Let's go see musicals and exhibitions.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.310
There are so many things we need to do!

14:48.100 --> 14:51.230
I guess I'll hang out with you instead of working.

14:51.230 --> 14:53.670
I'll be happy if you would!

14:53.670 --> 14:56.480
Anyway, take care and get here quickly!

14:56.480 --> 14:58.040
Okay.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.030
My niece, too, see you soon!

15:01.030 --> 15:03.090
- Uncle, ciao!
- Ciao.

15:03.090 --> 15:05.110
Bye!

15:06.890 --> 15:09.510
I'm glad he's coming back.

15:09.510 --> 15:12.600
By the way, Mom,

15:12.600 --> 15:15.480
- Hae Rim isn't coming to school or the academy these days.
- Really?

15:15.480 --> 15:18.150
The kids were saying that she's smoking and drinking

15:18.150 --> 15:20.200
and hanging out with weird kids.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.990
- I was crazy surprised.
- Crazy surprised?

15:22.990 --> 15:25.240
Speak properly, I told you.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.890
All the kids say it.

15:26.890 --> 15:29.580
- I'll get going.
- Study hard!

16:06.530 --> 16:08.230
When I'm with them,

I feel the happiest and most comfortable.

I become very attentive.

Okay, I got it.

Okay, that's enough.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.020
Okay, okay.

But... do you

16:32.670 --> 16:34.680
have to use social media?

16:34.680 --> 16:36.430
Why?

16:36.430 --> 16:39.040
Are you worried I'll post something about you?

16:40.570 --> 16:44.210
"The great Rahen Group's executive director is my boyfriend."

16:44.210 --> 16:46.950
Are you worried I'll tell it to the whole world?

16:51.150 --> 16:52.700
Don't worry.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.880
I don't want people knowing about my private life either.

16:56.460 --> 16:58.410
I only post

16:58.410 --> 17:01.310
the kids' art so their parents can see.

17:01.310 --> 17:03.290
That's fine then.

17:32.980 --> 17:36.930
You're... Hae Rim.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.950
Are you okay? Did you get hurt at all?

17:39.950 --> 17:41.990
Get in the car. Let's go to the hospital.

17:41.990 --> 17:44.050
I'm not hurt.

17:44.050 --> 17:46.590
The car didn't even touch me.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.610
Have you been... drinking?

17:52.610 --> 17:55.240
Can you give me a ride?

18:00.500 --> 18:03.750
Hold on. Who would smell like

18:03.750 --> 18:05.790
lotion when they're coming home from work?

18:05.790 --> 18:08.020
Wouldn't that be odd?

18:08.830 --> 18:11.090
Don't use the lotion.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.790
That's true.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.460
Remember, I saved your life.

18:15.460 --> 18:18.100
You're my savior.

18:20.890 --> 18:23.680
For my savior,

18:23.680 --> 18:25.280
what can I do?

18:25.280 --> 18:27.760
I'm hungry.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.650
I want to eat something you made.

19:14.010 --> 19:15.710
How is it?

19:16.820 --> 19:19.450
I love the pasta that you

19:19.450 --> 19:22.000
make for me the most.

19:30.180 --> 19:32.220
Get inside.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.760
Help!

20:13.760 --> 20:15.190
Help me!

20:15.190 --> 20:16.830
Ahjumma.

20:16.830 --> 20:19.370
Ahjumma, help!

20:19.370 --> 20:22.290
Hae Rim! What happened?

20:22.290 --> 20:24.210
Help.

20:24.210 --> 20:25.860
What is it?

20:42.550 --> 20:44.930
Hae Rim's mom!

20:44.930 --> 20:47.180
Oh no!

20:56.130 --> 20:59.900
Hello? Please get here quick!

21:00.700 --> 21:04.410
There's a musical I want to see. Do you want to go with me?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.400
You promised not to do this.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.540
I'm asking to watch just one musical together. You can't?

21:16.540 --> 21:20.840
There are a lot more people who recognize me out there than you think.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.690
When you're that careful,

21:22.690 --> 21:25.060
how did you move me into this building?

21:25.060 --> 21:30.780
That's because I missed you. You didn't know?

21:32.110 --> 21:33.850
I did.

21:37.330 --> 21:42.370
As long as we're careful, nothing will go wrong.

21:42.370 --> 21:44.290
Careful...

21:45.770 --> 21:49.740
What if I'm not careful?

21:51.790 --> 21:54.060
You're a smart woman.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.300
That's true.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.930
I don't want anything bad happening to you.

22:05.770 --> 22:08.960
It's nice

22:08.960 --> 22:11.430
having you so close by.

22:11.430 --> 22:15.330
Whenever I miss you, I can see you.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.900
Hold on a second.

22:44.380 --> 22:46.110
Yes, honey.

22:46.110 --> 22:48.050
Where are you?

22:48.050 --> 22:51.210
- When are you coming home?
- I'm almost there.

22:55.060 --> 22:57.370
That's terrible.

22:57.370 --> 22:59.970
You're okay, though, right?

23:02.080 --> 23:05.020
Okay. I'll be right there.

24:13.950 --> 24:16.520
<i>Yeon Joo!</i>

24:16.520 --> 24:20.250
<i>Yeon Joo!</i>

24:21.390 --> 24:23.410
<i>Yeon Joo!</i>

24:23.410 --> 24:27.120
<i>Please wake up, Yeon Joo!</i>

24:27.120 --> 24:31.070
<i>Yeon Joo!</i>

24:59.740 --> 25:01.190
Honey.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.300
You woke up because of me. Sorry.

25:06.890 --> 25:10.030
You must have been really shocked because of Hae Rim's mom.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.250
You can't even sleep.

25:14.480 --> 25:17.760
It's not our concern. Don't worry too much.

25:17.760 --> 25:20.620
But it feels personal.

25:20.620 --> 25:24.100
Is it reminding you of your sister?

25:24.100 --> 25:27.130
I thought I forgot everything,

25:27.130 --> 25:32.350
but the old memories just flooded back in.

25:32.350 --> 25:34.650
I was taken aback.

25:36.760 --> 25:40.250
Had I at least been understanding of Yeon Joo,

25:41.380 --> 25:46.040
Had I at least taken her side...

25:47.490 --> 25:50.380
my sister, Yeon Joo...

25:50.380 --> 25:53.600
she wouldn't have ended up like that.

26:02.720 --> 26:07.400
When will you finally be able to free yourself

26:07.400 --> 26:09.470
from the guilt toward your sister?

26:13.140 --> 26:15.390
What can I do to

26:15.390 --> 26:19.640
help heal the scar in your heart?

26:24.660 --> 26:29.790
Still, thanks to you being with me whenever things got hard,

26:29.790 --> 26:34.480
because you were with me, I could bear it.

26:34.480 --> 26:38.410
I'm so grateful you're my husband.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.850
I'm more grateful

26:41.850 --> 26:44.080
that you're my wife.

27:47.470 --> 27:51.160
Oh my! Wasn't it a brilliant performance?

27:51.160 --> 27:54.610
Let's take an intermission and see each other in the second half.

27:54.610 --> 27:58.040
Sir, I'll show you where you can rest.

27:58.040 --> 28:01.530
I need to go use the restroom.

28:01.530 --> 28:02.980
Okay.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.550
That woman is a mistress I heard.

28:14.550 --> 28:17.410
What? Really?

28:17.410 --> 28:21.120
Mrs. Jung's sister came by to meet with Mrs. Jung

28:21.120 --> 28:24.130
and recognized her and told her sister.

28:24.130 --> 28:27.740
So that sister used to live across from that woman.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.800
I can't believe that!

28:29.800 --> 28:33.500
She must live her life

28:33.500 --> 28:35.760
flirting with married men.

28:37.420 --> 28:41.480
Don't talk about her over unconfirmed rumors.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.840
Pardon?

28:47.030 --> 28:50.460
Let's not talk about people behind their back

28:50.460 --> 28:53.220
when you don't know the whole story.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.620
What? Why has the atmosphere soured?

29:19.620 --> 29:21.610
I'll have some water, please.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.470
Why does the water taste so bad? (meaning the place has unattractive members)

29:31.470 --> 29:34.680
- Manager Kang.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:35.370 --> 29:39.530
What type of member screening are you doing?

29:39.530 --> 29:41.170
Is there an issue?

29:41.170 --> 29:44.360
Who cares if the facility is fancy

29:44.360 --> 29:47.090
when you let anyone and everyone in as members?

29:47.090 --> 29:49.630
What's the difference from the tacky neighborhood community club then?

29:49.630 --> 29:51.110
I'm not understanding you.

29:51.110 --> 29:57.670
You should look more carefully into potential members and only accept those who are worthy.

29:57.670 --> 30:00.230
Don't give everyone the membership just because they can pay.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.210
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but there are no clubs anywhere

30:02.210 --> 30:06.630
that looks into members' personal information. Sorry.

30:06.630 --> 30:10.040
Wow. Then even if a woman

30:10.040 --> 30:12.300
who is dirty and inferior come in as members

30:12.300 --> 30:14.740
all you're going to say is,

30:14.740 --> 30:16.930
"There's nothing I can do about it"?

30:18.630 --> 30:21.690
What are you looking at? What?

30:23.960 --> 30:27.030
- I guess you feel guilty about something.
- That's enough.

30:30.710 --> 30:32.530
I mean, this woman...

30:35.240 --> 30:39.820
Let's go, Mi Ra. You don't deserve to listen to all this.

30:39.820 --> 30:42.600
She's not worth dealing with.

30:44.370 --> 30:47.750
This woman is a mistress!

30:47.750 --> 30:50.600
- You don't even know who you're getting angry at!
- Oh, it's hot!

30:53.630 --> 30:54.870
Oh...

30:54.870 --> 30:59.160
Oops. I am so sorry.

31:01.980 --> 31:04.980
Are you okay? Did you get a burn?

31:18.810 --> 31:22.570
Seriously, what's wrong with you?!

31:29.820 --> 31:31.280
Let's go.

31:41.790 --> 31:44.950
That young thing was being so rude!

31:44.950 --> 31:47.790
Well, she is pretty, but

31:47.790 --> 31:51.050
those kinds of girls... I'll call you back.

31:51.800 --> 31:55.320
What? What is it?

31:58.070 --> 32:00.270
What do you want?

32:01.400 --> 32:03.160
What are you doing?

32:07.300 --> 32:09.500
Hold on! Are you crazy?

32:09.500 --> 32:12.910
Did you attack me without expecting at least this much counterattack?

32:14.470 --> 32:18.190
What? Are you going to tell everyone about this, too?

32:18.190 --> 32:21.720
Why? You think I can't?

32:22.740 --> 32:24.720
Do what you want.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.850
Feel free.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.290
Oh!

32:35.290 --> 32:37.520
Is anyone there?

32:39.060 --> 32:44.200
♫ <i>Hello. Hello anybody there?</i> ♫

32:54.050 --> 32:55.390
<i>On My Side</i>

33:39.690 --> 33:45.800
<i>National Movers</i>

33:56.470 --> 33:57.740
Do you know something?

33:57.740 --> 34:02.380
You used to be my role model.

34:03.700 --> 34:06.700
I wanted to live like a heroine in a fairy tale...

34:06.700 --> 34:09.580
but everything got ruined.

34:10.679 --> 34:14.290
Wherever you go, live well.

34:14.290 --> 34:18.590
Live happily, too, Han Seon Joo.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.580
Like now, forever.

34:25.929 --> 34:27.280
We finished loading!

34:27.280 --> 34:29.920
Let's go then.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.080
She finally left.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.710
I'm a little sad.

34:57.880 --> 35:03.200
In the end, marriage is when you withstand the pain and keep pushing through,

35:03.200 --> 35:07.880
or give each other pain and die little by little.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.290
Isn't it one of the two?

35:10.290 --> 35:12.190
What is she talking about again?

35:12.190 --> 35:14.430
Good bye then.

35:18.490 --> 35:20.480
Whoever moves in next,

35:20.480 --> 35:25.110
I really hope they're normal.

35:41.560 --> 35:45.460
If you get divorced, I'm going to kill myself.

35:48.440 --> 35:53.080
Mom. I saw Hae Rim recently, and seriously,

35:53.080 --> 35:56.370
she was hanging out with weird kids and smoking.

35:56.370 --> 35:58.490
I was so shocked.

35:59.710 --> 36:04.190
But if I was her, I don't think I could have been able to deal, either.

36:09.540 --> 36:13.120
Let's go get ready to go out.

36:17.460 --> 36:20.450
What are you doing here at this hour?

36:20.450 --> 36:24.010
I think I need to take the kids somewhere.

36:24.010 --> 36:25.440
Where?

36:25.440 --> 36:27.200
That's...

36:28.830 --> 36:31.640
I'm really late. I'll tell you when we get back.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.520
Kids, come with me.

36:33.520 --> 36:37.220
I was about to go volunteer with the kids.

36:37.220 --> 36:38.890
You can do it next time.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.590
Let's go.

36:41.510 --> 36:43.740
What are you doing? We're late.

36:43.740 --> 36:45.540
Hurry up.

37:18.530 --> 37:21.970
Mi Ra. What brings you here?

37:21.970 --> 37:24.870
I wanted to return your scarf.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.790
You could have returned it later.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.350
You came all the way for this?

37:37.480 --> 37:39.210
I feel bad.

37:39.210 --> 37:43.900
I want to offer you some tea, but I was about to go out.

37:43.900 --> 37:48.120
It's okay. It's my fault for showing up without notice.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.460
I'll drop you off on my way out.

37:51.460 --> 37:53.150
Let's go.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.800
Can I ask where you're going?

38:07.800 --> 38:10.030
It's a center that looks after one-parent families.

38:10.030 --> 38:12.000
One-parent families?

38:12.000 --> 38:15.350
I go there once a month and volunteer.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.590
That's good of you to do.

38:19.320 --> 38:24.220
At first, I thought I was doing something good, too,

38:24.220 --> 38:27.920
but after a while, I realized I was getting so much more.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.190
Like presents.

38:30.190 --> 38:31.910
I see.

38:33.780 --> 38:38.030
Should I drop you off at your building?

38:38.030 --> 38:42.200
By chance, can I come, too?

38:42.200 --> 38:43.220
Pardon?

38:43.220 --> 38:45.840
I'd like to go to the center with you.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.480
Really?

38:47.480 --> 38:51.380
I was going to go with my kids,

38:51.380 --> 38:54.320
but their dad took them.

38:54.320 --> 38:58.290
Since we can use all the help we can get...

38:58.290 --> 39:00.880
I'll come, too, then.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.620
Thank you.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.950
- Ta da!
- Wow!

39:20.950 --> 39:22.120
What is this?

39:22.120 --> 39:24.550
Let's go camping today.

39:24.550 --> 39:27.130
Dad, you're the best!

39:27.130 --> 39:29.840
- What are you doing?
- I agree.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.150
Let's go!

39:31.150 --> 39:32.950
Let's go!

39:50.700 --> 39:52.590
I'll take that.

39:54.070 --> 39:56.620
This one, too.

40:08.330 --> 40:10.190
It came out well.

41:00.680 --> 41:02.470
Aren't you tired?

41:02.470 --> 41:05.640
Not at all. I'm having a nice time.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.630
The kids really like you.

41:08.630 --> 41:11.570
I love playing with kids.

41:11.570 --> 41:15.120
Playing with them, like you said,

41:15.120 --> 41:18.180
I feel like I'm receiving a present.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.220
This is my gift to you.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.830
I gave it back to you, though.

41:31.830 --> 41:35.710
I wanted to give it to you. Please take it.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.650
Thank you.

42:47.470 --> 42:49.980
What is it?

42:49.980 --> 42:52.390
It's you again.

43:18.560 --> 43:22.090
<i>Queen's Club</i>

44:39.730 --> 44:41.420
Oh.

44:41.420 --> 44:43.220
The issue with entering the Shanghai department store,

44:43.220 --> 44:45.700
wasn't it resolved?

44:45.700 --> 44:48.410
I know. I thought it was over,

44:48.410 --> 44:50.630
but now they're changing their tune.

44:51.190 --> 44:53.760
I need to go there myself

44:53.760 --> 44:55.780
and finish it off completely.

44:56.290 --> 44:58.740
You'll do well like you've always done.

44:58.740 --> 45:01.250
I feel stronger since you're cheering me on.

45:01.250 --> 45:02.780
Be strong.

45:04.140 --> 45:05.920
I'll be back.

45:17.740 --> 45:20.190
<i>Phone</i>

45:23.070 --> 45:25.450
<i>I have to go on a business...</i>

45:41.620 --> 45:44.350
<i>I have to go on a business trip. I won't be able to come by for a few days.</i>

45:44.350 --> 45:46.500
<i>Don't skip meals just because you can't be bothered</i>

45:46.500 --> 45:48.970
<i>and make sure to eat.</i>

46:04.570 --> 46:07.220
Still, he's the executive director.

46:07.220 --> 46:09.170
You could have sent someone else.

46:09.170 --> 46:11.990
It's not fair to my husband.

46:11.990 --> 46:14.430
He's lucky to be my son-in-law.

46:14.430 --> 46:17.250
He should be working harder than anyone else.

46:20.030 --> 46:23.470
So how long are you going to be a housewife?

46:23.470 --> 46:26.670
When the kids go to college, will you start working again then?

46:26.670 --> 46:30.730
It's time for you to acknowledge your son-in-law.

46:30.730 --> 46:33.640
I acknowledge that he's good at what he does.

46:33.640 --> 46:36.770
Right now, he's hiding his claws,

46:36.770 --> 46:40.960
but one day, he'll show his true colors.

46:40.960 --> 46:43.440
Please don't look at him with prejudice.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.710
Don't trust him!

46:47.320 --> 46:50.660
- Never.
- I chose him, though.

46:50.660 --> 46:52.860
So mom, please stop--

46:52.860 --> 46:56.100
You chose him, not me.

46:57.540 --> 47:00.750
You might have succeeded as a businesswoman,

47:00.750 --> 47:03.340
but you failed in taking care of your family.

47:04.040 --> 47:07.060
I don't want to end up like you.

47:11.300 --> 47:15.640
You don't know what your father did to me!

47:17.780 --> 47:20.040
Do you even realize what you two

47:20.040 --> 47:24.310
did to me, Yeon Joo, and Jung Won?

47:25.010 --> 47:29.810
You made us into orphans because of your emotional fights with each other!

47:34.050 --> 47:37.070
I don't want to live like you. I'm going to

47:37.070 --> 47:39.020
protect my family perfectly, like I have done.

47:39.020 --> 47:41.310
I am going to make sure my kids

47:41.310 --> 47:44.860
grow up in a normal family, not lacking anything.

47:44.860 --> 47:46.990
Having a happy family

47:47.560 --> 47:49.980
is my life's goal.

48:27.830 --> 48:31.640
<i>Do you have time right now?</i>

49:30.990 --> 49:33.360
You majored in art, right?

49:34.830 --> 49:36.330
How did you know?

49:36.330 --> 49:39.460
You have a special eye for art.

49:39.460 --> 49:43.050
Like some keen eye of a professional.

49:43.050 --> 49:45.750
My dream was to become an artist.

49:45.750 --> 49:49.460
Now, I teach kids at an art school.

49:49.460 --> 49:52.640
- Twice a week.
- I knew it.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.860
You must be good at painting then.

49:54.860 --> 49:58.380
I was always envious of people who could draw.

49:58.380 --> 50:00.850
My younger siblings...

50:01.910 --> 50:03.990
My siblings...

50:03.990 --> 50:05.910
draw well, too.

50:05.910 --> 50:08.410
You have a younger siblings?

50:08.410 --> 50:10.750
I have one younger brother.

50:10.750 --> 50:12.800
And one sister...

50:12.800 --> 50:14.340
My brother is in Milan

50:14.340 --> 50:16.700
studying design.

50:18.590 --> 50:22.100
And your sister? Does she paint?

50:22.100 --> 50:24.110
No.

50:24.110 --> 50:27.520
Then what does she do now?

50:29.180 --> 50:31.300
She died.

50:47.450 --> 50:50.150
I know what the people at Queen's Club

50:50.150 --> 50:53.240
are saying about me.

50:53.240 --> 50:55.880
They whisper that I'm a mistress

50:55.880 --> 50:58.530
who goes after married men, don't they?

51:04.950 --> 51:07.140
Isn't it ridiculous?

51:08.670 --> 51:10.900
People are so good at making up gossip.

51:10.900 --> 51:13.340
They're all fiction writers.

51:17.350 --> 51:20.740
It's because you're so pretty.

51:20.740 --> 51:23.110
Because they're jealous.

51:23.970 --> 51:26.950
Why are you being so good to me?

51:27.560 --> 51:30.980
Me? When was I good to you?

51:30.980 --> 51:33.360
You were good to me.

51:33.360 --> 51:37.150
All these years, no one

51:37.150 --> 51:39.410
has ever been so good to me.

51:42.390 --> 51:44.340
Well...

51:45.090 --> 51:49.440
we have a special fate.

51:50.030 --> 51:54.490
It's not easy to meet while traveling and bump into each other again.

51:56.620 --> 52:00.410
But to be honest,

52:00.410 --> 52:04.080
when I first saw you on the boat in Yeosu,

52:04.080 --> 52:06.760
you reminded me of my sister.

52:07.880 --> 52:09.980
I don't know why, though.

52:09.980 --> 52:12.670
You and my sister

52:12.670 --> 52:15.180
don't even look alike.

52:15.180 --> 52:18.680
The one who died...

52:31.320 --> 52:33.810
Should I be your sister from now on?

52:36.910 --> 52:40.130
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

52:40.130 --> 52:43.220
Don't let it bother you. I didn't mean it.

52:43.220 --> 52:45.190
I would love that.

52:45.190 --> 52:47.200
Someone as pretty as you

52:47.200 --> 52:49.550
willing to be my sister...

52:50.210 --> 52:52.420
I'm so happy.

52:52.420 --> 52:54.600
Really?

52:55.600 --> 52:59.230
Let's be sisters from this moment on.

52:59.230 --> 53:01.000
Then please speak comfortably.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.850
Since I'm your sister from now on.

53:02.850 --> 53:05.510
Then I will.

53:05.510 --> 53:07.160
Okay.

53:24.400 --> 53:28.490
Thanks to you, I had a nice time. Thank you, sis.

53:28.490 --> 53:30.230
Me too, Unni.

53:30.230 --> 53:31.230
Good by then.

53:31.230 --> 53:33.350
Get home safe.

53:42.150 --> 53:47.930
I... have something to tell you.

53:47.930 --> 53:51.690
I feel like I should be honest with you.

53:51.690 --> 53:53.730
Actually...

53:56.200 --> 53:59.310
the rumor is true.

54:01.330 --> 54:03.010
I...

54:05.000 --> 54:08.620
love someone who belongs to another woman.

54:15.240 --> 54:17.780
You're surprised, aren't you?

54:28.960 --> 54:32.750
I'm a little taken aback...

54:36.090 --> 54:38.940
I'll get going then.

54:43.270 --> 54:46.050
I'll call you later.

55:20.320 --> 55:25.400
<i>I love someone who belongs to another woman.</i>

55:37.000 --> 55:38.570
<i>You must be crazy.</i>

55:38.570 --> 55:41.090
<i>That's a crime. It's theft.</i>

55:41.090 --> 55:42.840
<i>You're a home wrecker.</i>

55:42.840 --> 55:45.280
<i>But I love him. Truly.</i>

55:45.280 --> 55:47.660
<i>Yeon Joo...</i>

55:47.660 --> 55:52.710
<i>If you point your finger at me too, there's nowhere for me to go.</i>

55:52.710 --> 55:56.320
<i>Unni, please save me.</i>

55:56.320 --> 55:58.840
<i>Please, Unni.</i>

55:58.840 --> 56:01.570
<i>Have you forgotten what pain</i>

56:01.570 --> 56:05.160
<i>we went through after Dad abandoned us and left?</i>

56:05.160 --> 56:06.620
<i>How could you...</i>

56:06.620 --> 56:10.010
<i>You of all people! How could you do something like that!</i>

56:10.010 --> 56:11.970
<i>Break up with him right now.</i>

56:11.970 --> 56:14.160
<i>I can't live without him!</i>

56:14.160 --> 56:16.740
<i>I can't live a day without him!</i>

56:16.740 --> 56:19.310
<i>I feel like i’ll die if I can't see him!</i>

56:19.310 --> 56:21.110
<i>Die then!</i>

56:21.110 --> 56:23.280
<i>Die then, you crazy wench!</i>

56:23.280 --> 56:25.750
<i>Die! Die right now!</i>

56:25.750 --> 56:28.730
<i>Die! Die! Die!</i>

57:16.170 --> 57:18.740
<i>Yoon Mi Ra</i>

57:21.480 --> 57:24.880
It's me, Han Seon Joo.

57:25.860 --> 57:29.070
Let's meet.

57:51.360 --> 57:55.720
<i>In this place, the girl everyone loved dreams forever.</i>

57:55.720 --> 57:58.600
It's my sister, Han Yeon Joo.

58:00.090 --> 58:05.050
My sister, too, loved someone she shouldn't have.

58:05.050 --> 58:09.340
Like you. In the end, she died.

58:09.340 --> 58:12.080
Because of that intense love.

58:15.450 --> 58:20.810
The end is always the same for affairs.

58:26.790 --> 58:29.290
You know, too.

58:29.290 --> 58:34.390
The end of your love... how it will be.

58:48.720 --> 58:55.140
It's not been long since we met, so it could come across as me being rude,

58:55.140 --> 59:02.270
but I'm saying this... because you really feel like my sister.

59:06.060 --> 59:08.080
That love...

59:10.310 --> 59:12.360
stop it.

59:26.810 --> 59:33.140
I tried to stop it, too.

59:33.140 --> 59:39.060
I went to Yeosu to stop the affair, as the last good-bye trip.

59:42.880 --> 59:47.540
But... but I couldn't.

59:50.270 --> 59:54.350
I don't think I can live without him.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.550
I don't like myself being this way, but I can't help it.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.670
I'd rather die than break up with him.

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:19.150
<i>I can't live a day without him. I feel like I'll die if I can't see him!</i>

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:22.310
<i>Die then. Die!</i>

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:24.590
<i>Die! Die!</i>

01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:28.340
<i>Die! Die!</i>

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.320
Then have that man.

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:06.300
If you can't let him go, take him.

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:09.370
If you can't break up with him, if you feel like dying without him,

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:15.310
then become that man's wife.

01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:17.550
Don't die.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:26.720
If you feel like you'll die,

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.900
take that man and make him yours.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.460
<i>My Side.</i>

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.880
Are you serious?

01:01:53.880 --> 01:02:01.450
That man... can I make him mine? Are you serious?

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.380
I am serious.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:08.720
If you love him to death, so you cannot break up with him, don't hesitate and take action.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:12.360
Don't die like a fool. Make him yours.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.520
Even by stealing or snatching.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.180
I am asking you to become that man's wife.

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:26.360
I will be on your side, Mi Ra.

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:33.930
