00:27.441 --> 00:28.919
I'm ready to go to bed.

00:29.181 --> 00:30.940
Well, if I turn this TV off,

Go on, get the stuff.

00:54.507 --> 00:56.592
The whip's up top. I put 'em up top.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.113
- Curtis.
- And you got the chains

00:59.136 --> 01:01.616
- in the drawer over there, don't you?
- That's where you put them whips?

01:01.640 --> 01:03.362
Yes. Couldn't find 'em.

01:03.693 --> 01:05.845
I was tired of you
using them all the time.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.135
I'm tired tonight, Curtis.

01:08.157 --> 01:10.114
I'm tired, and I am going to bed.

01:11.041 --> 01:12.608
All right.

01:13.127 --> 01:15.333
I don't know why you
tired. You don't work.

01:17.126 --> 01:18.466
What'd you say?

01:19.409 --> 01:23.120
Oh. I said, baby, I know
you're tired. Go to sleep.

No.

No, no, no. I want
to hear what you said.

That was a scream.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.660
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

02:34.682 --> 02:36.304
Think it was Lynn.

02:36.429 --> 02:38.964

- Curtis.

02:40.559 --> 02:43.320

That's why they want to move
in the house in the first place.

That's why you didn't want to move
in the house in the first place.

They were biting me.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.092
Who was biting you?

04:28.267 --> 04:29.697
The rats.

04:29.718 --> 04:31.102
What rats?

04:31.278 --> 04:33.531
Curtis, ain't no rats in here, Curtis.

You're safe here, baby.
You're safe. It's okay.

04:49.029 --> 04:51.836
But what if he puts the
rat in the room again?

What if who puts a
rat in the room again?

04:54.740 --> 04:56.127
Kendrick.

04:57.209 --> 05:00.078
Kendrick put a rat in your room, baby?

05:00.079 --> 05:03.309
Yeah, he said he was
gonna teach us a lesson

05:03.335 --> 05:06.208
because we wouldn't stop screaming.

05:06.644 --> 05:07.861

- Ella.
- Curtis.

Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. I am so mad!

05:19.670 --> 05:21.477
At least they not with him anymore.

05:22.574 --> 05:24.176
I know that, Curtis.

05:24.509 --> 05:28.617
But it is just crazy that people
would treat children like that.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.862
- Yes, it is, baby. I know.
- They're so innocent.

05:33.044 --> 05:35.108
- Who?
- Children.

05:35.573 --> 05:37.671
You ain't talkin' about them children.

05:40.393 --> 05:43.211
This is not a joking matter, Curtis.

05:43.232 --> 05:44.727
Okay.

05:45.677 --> 05:49.222
- And Nyla put up with that, Curtis.
- Yes, she did.

05:50.457 --> 05:53.092
I'm really, really,
really, really, really,

05:53.093 --> 05:55.300
really trying not to judge her.

05:55.562 --> 05:59.340
But it's really, really,
really, really, really hard.

06:01.341 --> 06:03.971
I don't know, baby. I think
you can judge on this one.

06:06.204 --> 06:08.056
I gotta talk to her. That's it.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.531
- I really gotta talk to her.
- Yeah.

it for in the morning.

in the morning, Curtis.

- That's good.
- This is wrong.

06:19.876 --> 06:21.263
- Yeah.
- It's wrong.

06:21.295 --> 06:22.801
It's wrong. Baby?

06:23.014 --> 06:24.610
But you gotta just calm down.

06:24.642 --> 06:28.934
- You can't let it get to you...
- Ooh! God help these babies!

Baby, you're not gonna start, um,

06:32.959 --> 06:36.028
praying and spitting all
over everything, are you?

06:37.458 --> 06:38.704
I'm not playing with you, Curtis.

06:38.728 --> 06:40.289
- Don't do that.
- I'm not, baby. I'm with you.

06:40.313 --> 06:42.400
I'm with you on this, okay?

06:42.416 --> 06:43.876
- I'm just saying.
- This is sad, and this is wrong.

06:43.900 --> 06:46.109
But come on. But we
need to get some sleep.

06:46.152 --> 06:49.472
- We can talk about it in the morning.
- I'm not sleeping, Curtis. I'm not sleeping.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.504
Turn the TV back on.

06:52.630 --> 06:53.826
Hand me that remote.

06:55.390 --> 06:58.112
- Baby, come on, get some sleep.
- Curtis, hand me that remote!

07:03.092 --> 07:04.885
What channel you gonna put it on?

07:07.655 --> 07:09.032
Curtis.

07:10.669 --> 07:12.372
Curtis, turn this TV on.

07:14.218 --> 07:16.145
It don't work no more, baby.

07:17.992 --> 07:19.907
I think the battery went out.

07:21.839 --> 07:23.397
Mm-hmm.

07:23.398 --> 07:25.031
You gonna cut that light out?

07:26.134 --> 07:28.436
God help these babies.

07:35.124 --> 07:37.173
- Ella, for real?
- Yes!

07:37.227 --> 07:40.519
She said he put a rat in the
room with them to punish them.

07:40.557 --> 07:42.655
Oh, I can't believe that!

07:42.980 --> 07:44.453
Yes.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.670
- This is horrible.
- Yes, it is.

07:46.952 --> 07:51.249
Oh. Now, why would she stay
with somebody like that?

07:52.365 --> 07:53.859
You tell me.

07:54.168 --> 07:57.330
- Well, it's good she got out of that.
- [SCOFFS]

07:57.365 --> 07:58.918
I hope so.

07:59.043 --> 08:02.211
What does that mean? She is with you.

08:02.243 --> 08:05.446
Yes, she is with me,
but you know how it goes.

08:05.483 --> 08:07.132
Your body leaves,

08:07.257 --> 08:09.096
but your heart is still there.

08:09.221 --> 08:12.730
Yes. Like my last husband, Frederick.

08:13.730 --> 08:17.026
My mind left, but my body stayed.

08:18.901 --> 08:20.943
[LAUGHS]

08:21.068 --> 08:23.251
Whoo! Mm.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.253
- Got a cigarette?
- Anyway,

08:25.640 --> 08:27.581
I hope that you're wrong about that.

08:27.634 --> 08:30.589
- Yeah, me, too.
- You know, he's...

08:30.609 --> 08:34.164
- Hi!
- Hi!

08:35.025 --> 08:36.818
I just got the kids on the bus.

08:36.846 --> 08:39.168
- Good, good. Good, good, good, good, good.
- Yeah.

08:39.241 --> 08:40.465
How are you this morning?

08:40.476 --> 08:42.580
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Good.

08:42.592 --> 08:45.069
Well, I'm better than
Lynn was last night.

08:45.547 --> 08:47.408
- What do you mean?
- Nyla,

08:47.434 --> 08:51.383
Lynn had nightmares
all night last night.

08:51.391 --> 08:54.210
Yeah, yeah. She's been
having a lot of those lately.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.790
Do you know why?

08:56.469 --> 08:58.108
Might be something she's been eating.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.960
Mm, no. I... I don't think that's it.

09:01.306 --> 09:03.641
- You don't?
- No. I know it's not.

09:03.816 --> 09:05.246
Oh. Then what is it?

09:05.584 --> 09:06.591
Nyla,

09:07.099 --> 09:10.584
what do you know about Kendrick
putting a rat in her room?

09:12.526 --> 09:14.977
- [LAUGHS] What?
- Yeah.

09:14.986 --> 09:17.612
She was up screaming
all night about a rat

09:17.625 --> 09:19.051
being in her room.

09:19.406 --> 09:21.340
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:21.348 --> 09:23.970
She told Ella that
Kendrick would put a rat

09:23.974 --> 09:26.320
- in her room to punish her.
- [LAUGHS] What?

09:26.345 --> 09:28.822
No, no, no. She's exaggerating.

09:28.907 --> 09:30.973
Are you sure? Yes.

09:31.357 --> 09:33.146
But there may be some truth in it.

09:33.462 --> 09:34.487
No.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.711
But there may be some truth in it?

09:37.035 --> 09:38.149
No.

09:38.217 --> 09:40.566
- Well, you said "exaggerated."
- Wait, wait, wait.

09:40.828 --> 09:43.585
You don't think I would
let him hurt my kids?

09:43.602 --> 09:45.481
No, no, no, no, no. I don't. I don't.

09:45.490 --> 09:47.819
- I was just asking a question.
- Miss Ella, wait.

09:47.858 --> 09:52.102
I would never let him
do anything to my kids.

09:52.790 --> 09:55.300
Well, I'm telling you what she said.

09:55.425 --> 09:57.882
And I'm telling you
she has an imagination.

09:58.062 --> 09:59.402
Are you sure?

09:59.671 --> 10:00.918
Yes.

10:02.289 --> 10:04.441
Well, I think you need
to check in with her.

10:06.695 --> 10:07.776
Miss Ella,

10:08.506 --> 10:09.718
Miss Joann,

10:09.843 --> 10:12.480
no offense, but that's my child.

10:12.706 --> 10:13.864
I know her.

10:14.803 --> 10:16.510
And no offense to you, Nyla.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.004
I know that's your child,

10:18.286 --> 10:20.045
but I know child trauma,

10:20.289 --> 10:22.483
and that baby is not making this up.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.335
You know what? I'm
gonna skip the coffee.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.277
Miss Joann, I'll be at
church if you need me.

10:28.473 --> 10:29.486
Okay.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.891
That didn't go well.

10:34.979 --> 10:38.322
Well, all I know is I am
not done with her about this.

10:38.497 --> 10:41.415
- [DOOR CLOSES]
- She can switch on out of here if she want to.

10:48.629 --> 10:50.972
Hello, hello! How was school?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.653
It was school.

10:53.229 --> 10:55.629
Well, put your books down, let's
get started on our homework.

10:56.755 --> 10:59.501
- Man, this is crazy!
- Yeah.

10:59.522 --> 11:01.401
- What's crazy?
- All this.

put a rat in your room.

- Are you sure about that?

11:44.163 --> 11:45.236
Yep.

Did your mama know?

11:50.428 --> 11:51.501
Yeah.

Yes, you do.

It makes me feel like she doesn't care.

12:10.106 --> 12:13.310
- So, you don't think your mom cares?
- Lynn.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.625

- Hi.

Well, I don't like looking back.

worse is not a good thing.

Yes.

She has an imagination, and she lies.
