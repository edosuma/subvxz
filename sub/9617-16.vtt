The sleepwalking bit
for one second.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.927
Would you let me have
cold spaghetti at midnight

00:28.929 --> 00:30.896
-If i was awake?
-Nope.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.700
(growls)

00:37.772 --> 00:39.938
What are you guys
doing up anyway?
It's midnight.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.707
They're trying to throw out
those people who own

00:41.709 --> 00:43.675
That wonderful old bookstore
over on jane street.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.278
They want to put in
another fast-food super cluck.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.881
But they're the world's most
powerful bucket of food people!

00:50.484 --> 00:52.317
They don't scare me.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.353
Who are you?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.488
I am no friend
of the super cluck!

00:56.490 --> 00:58.557
They're trying to take over
the whole neighborhood.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.226
But i will be there
everywhere they want to go.

01:02.797 --> 01:05.431
So, you stay up late
and protect our community?

01:05.433 --> 01:07.333
Trying.

01:07.334 --> 01:09.234
Yeah, well, you know
what i do at night? I sleep.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.936
Well, that's very
important, honey.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.405
Well, a kid like me
needs 15 hours.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.409
Dad, mom's trying
to save our whole city.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.644
How are you gonna beat that?

01:18.646 --> 01:21.914
I'm trying to get
through maya's paper.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.749
He beat you.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.634
She uses her intelligence

02:15.636 --> 02:17.469

Yeah. She's really somethin'.

Mm. He's cute.

-What will i ever do?
-You'll do stuff.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.996
What?

02:26.997 --> 02:28.480
Riles, the great thing
about being us,

02:28.482 --> 02:30.616
We don't have to worry
about being them.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.751
Too late.
I started and i don't
like where it's going.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.486
Riley, if you're trying
to tell me

02:34.488 --> 02:36.421
How great your parents are,
i know.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.890
You're very lucky
to have them.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.591
Not everybody does.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.627
Maybe they're
the lucky ones, maya.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.995
Why?

02:42.997 --> 02:45.364
They're cory and topanga and...

02:45.366 --> 02:46.598
I'm just
their little shadow,

02:46.600 --> 02:48.400
Living in the reflection
of the sun.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.436

What did he do?

03:54.935 --> 03:56.835
First bull with a last name!

03:56.837 --> 03:58.770
First man to circumnavigate
the globe.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.606
Who are you gonna believe?

04:03.544 --> 04:06.511
Everyone thought
the world was flat. Why?

04:06.513 --> 04:07.779
They could only see
to the horizon.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.114
They were too scared
to go out.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.049
They thought they'd
fall off the world.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.417
I don't blame 'em.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.820
Well, what about you guys?

04:14.822 --> 04:16.188
What's your horizon line?

04:16.190 --> 04:19.491
Write down the one thing
in life you consider impossible.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.926
Where do you
fall off the earth?

04:23.197 --> 04:25.564
Well, it looks like
everyone found something
pretty easily.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.432
That's too bad.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.601
Because when you think
you can't do something,

04:29.603 --> 04:32.070
Your world is as flat
as a piece of paper.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.872
So, crumple them up.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.076
Now, look at 'em.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.048
You hold your world
in your hands.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.584
Nothing's impossible
if you take a shot.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.053
So, take a shot.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.928
Take a shot, farkle.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.930
Oh, that's okay, sir.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.098
Why not?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.800
Well, i'd only miss.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.485
Do you mind?

05:03.486 --> 05:05.169
Hey, it's not like
it's a big surprise.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.872
"athlete."

05:08.542 --> 05:10.175
You don't think
you could be an athlete

05:10.177 --> 05:11.527
Like lucas if you tried?

05:11.528 --> 05:12.878
I'm not sure you can
be as good as someone

05:12.880 --> 05:14.613
-Just because
you want to, sir.
-Well...

05:14.615 --> 05:16.515
You'll never know
unless you take a shot.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.192
Why are you smiling
at me so pretty?

05:27.194 --> 05:31.129
Because i want the last thing
you ever see to be nice.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.676
Okay, so...
Farkle has just given us

05:44.678 --> 05:46.078
A great idea
for an assignment.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.180
-(class groans)
-yay.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.284
Farkle, you're gonna
become an athlete.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.854
-Class: Yay!
-(farkle groans)

05:55.856 --> 05:57.889
-Mr. Friar...
-Oh, no.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.526
Your assignment is
to help him get there.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.562
I'm sorry if this changes
what you thought was impossible.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.564
No, that's what i had.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.631
Ha ha.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.233
That's what i had.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.603
Riley...

06:11.605 --> 06:13.872
Is there anything
in your sweet riley mind

06:13.874 --> 06:15.474
That you consider impossible?

06:15.475 --> 06:17.075
There is no future
to look forward to

06:17.077 --> 06:18.877
To where i'm anywhere
near as good as you guys.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.713
What are you talking about?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.316
You and mom,
cory and topanga--

06:24.318 --> 06:26.084
You're my impossible thing.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.552
I don't understand.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.888
Maybe some people do
just fall off the world, dad.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.691
-What do you mean, riley--
-(school bell rings)

06:38.599 --> 06:41.566
Look, it's just today's thing.
It'll be gone tomorrow.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.069
The only thing
going away is me.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.705
Can somebody please direct
me to the edge of the earth?

06:46.707 --> 06:48.306
I assume it's near the river.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.108
Now?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.676
You're falling
off the world now?

06:51.678 --> 06:52.844
I can't compete with you.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.880
-In what?
-Life.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.249
So, i have to go
and find my own way.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.851
I have to go and create
my own individual path

06:59.853 --> 07:02.687
And i must do it
all alone, by myself.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.289
Come on, maya!

07:06.860 --> 07:09.161
Um... We'll be at the river.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.952
Here?

07:16.953 --> 07:18.670
You think this is falling
off the face of the earth?

07:18.672 --> 07:22.274
My only chance
at peace and serenity is
at a sanctuary of solitude,

07:22.276 --> 07:24.643
Away from mommy
and daddy perfect.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.144
Hello.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.914
Is there something i can do
for you young ladies?

07:28.916 --> 07:31.650
I'd like to renounce
all of my worldly possessions,

07:31.652 --> 07:33.084
Except for all of my stuff!

07:34.755 --> 07:36.788
Aww, you're fun!

07:36.790 --> 07:38.156
Let me in, sister.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.258
Life out here holds
no promise for me.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.694
Well, i'm very sorry
to hear that.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.362
-What's your name?
-Riley.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.931
But i want
my nun name to be

07:45.933 --> 07:47.666
Sister riley
of perpetual bleh.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.769
Sorry, that name's
already been taken.

07:50.771 --> 07:55.974
How about
sis ri per bleh 84263?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.409
-Or blinky?
-(gasps)

07:57.411 --> 07:59.778
Blinky was
my second choice.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.847
Congratulations.
You're blinky the nun.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.716
-How about you?
-You don't want this.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.951
All right, ladies.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.853
May i ask
what's really going on?

08:07.855 --> 08:10.422
Sister blinky is upset
because her parents are perfect

08:10.424 --> 08:11.723
And she'll never
live up to them.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.692
Riley, let me help you.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.794
Human perfection
is unattainable.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.196
In all of my experiences
with people,

08:18.198 --> 08:20.765
There's only one
who even comes close.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.267
Oh. (gasps)

08:22.269 --> 08:24.870
-The mother superior?
-No, the next one.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.672
Thank you, topanga.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.274
You have saved
our orphanage

08:29.276 --> 08:30.842
From becoming
a super cluck.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.344
It was a group effort.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.745
I'm only one topanga.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.680
Oh, hi, girls.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.717
(heroic music playing)

08:38.719 --> 08:40.685
-Cab!
-(wheels screech)

08:40.687 --> 08:42.354
Now, if she were your mother,

08:42.356 --> 08:44.723
I'd understand
why you'd wanna...

08:44.725 --> 08:47.092
Oh, blinky.
Oh, you poor thing.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.199
All right, farkle.
Let's see what you got.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.034
(grunts)

08:56.036 --> 08:57.469
I quit.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.371
I will not fail
this assignment--

08:59.373 --> 09:02.307
-(thuds)
-i quit again.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.875
You know what sitting
in the stands,

09:03.877 --> 09:05.810
Watching those games
you play makes me realize?

09:05.812 --> 09:07.329
You love sports?

09:07.330 --> 09:08.847
Admit it.
You love the thrill
of competition.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.449
Every sport is the same.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.050
Being good at sports
is just a matter of physics.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.719
Don't you mess up
america's most favorite thing

09:14.721 --> 09:16.755
With america's
least favorite thing!

09:16.757 --> 09:18.223
With the correct
angle and velocity,

09:18.225 --> 09:19.891
I should make
every shot every time.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.126
Is that right?

09:21.128 --> 09:22.761
Let's try a foul shot.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.063
Just put this ball here
through that hoop there?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.131
That's it.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.901
(laser humming)

09:29.903 --> 09:30.969
(beeping)

09:34.942 --> 09:35.974
Got it.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.309
Shoot it.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.848
-Huh.
-Huh.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.452
I probably should've
considered the x-factor.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.888
And what's the x-factor?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.122
(laser humming)

09:51.124 --> 09:52.757
(beeping)

09:54.461 --> 09:56.127
(beeping increases)

09:56.129 --> 09:58.229
I stink.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.864
I've gotta say.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.800
Oh, yeah?
Well, i'd like to see you...

10:03.303 --> 10:04.402
Do...

10:06.239 --> 10:07.372
Better.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.944
New sport!

10:12.946 --> 10:14.512
Oh, please.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.981
All i need to do
is compact my body

10:15.983 --> 10:17.916
Into a solid mass
and then you can't pin me.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.385
What is that?
Physics? Okay.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.395
New sport!

10:32.199 --> 10:33.965
I've never even
understood this game.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.533
You run around the bases
and try to get home, right?

10:35.535 --> 10:36.918
Yeah.

10:36.919 --> 10:38.302
Well, why do you
need the other bases?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.405
Because you can't get home
until you get around
all of them.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.874
But the quickest way
between two points
is a straight line.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.076
You want to get rid
of the bases?

10:45.078 --> 10:46.411
Yeah. Game's over sooner

10:46.413 --> 10:47.979
And we can all
get back to physics.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.915
Farkle, not everyone lives
for theories and numbers.

10:50.917 --> 10:51.883
Well, they should.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.553
Come here.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.824
-Shoot.
-(scoffs)

10:59.826 --> 11:01.993
It's a waste of time.
It's an impossible shot.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.995
Running the bases
is a waste of time.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.864
This impossible shot...

11:05.866 --> 11:07.332
(laser humming)

11:07.334 --> 11:08.900
(beeping)

11:19.546 --> 11:21.012
Oh.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.614
...Is not impossible at all.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.184
-I don't know, farkle.
-Shoot it.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.360
I believe
everything you say now.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.562
And i believe
basketball may not be so bad.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.297
Wanna do it again?

11:41.268 --> 11:42.818
Here?

11:42.819 --> 11:44.369
You think this is falling
off the face of the earth?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.870
Well, hello.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.072
Something i can do
for you ladies?

11:47.074 --> 11:49.607
I'm here to run away
and join the circus.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.943
Well, you came
to the right place.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.611
You got a circus name?

11:53.613 --> 11:55.146
How about blinky?

11:55.148 --> 11:57.882
That's no good.
I already got 50 blinkys

11:57.884 --> 11:59.184
Right now
in a little car back there.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.021
You know, i sense that
you're not really running

12:03.023 --> 12:06.224
To the circus
as much as running
away from something.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.026
You're very wise.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.160
Thank you.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.030
Anyway, all
of us circus folk have,

12:12.032 --> 12:13.531
You know, run away
from something

12:13.533 --> 12:15.066
At one time or another.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.203
For me, it was my father.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.538
I knew i could never
live up to him.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.340
You understand
what i'm sayin'?

12:22.342 --> 12:25.210
Yes, clown. Yes.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.479
-You know what this is?
-(gasps)

12:27.481 --> 12:31.015
-It's a pretty flower.
-I think it's not.

12:31.017 --> 12:33.068
Yeah, well, you know what?

12:33.069 --> 12:35.120
It was handed down
to me by my father,
jingles the first.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.655
-Was he a clown?
-No, he made keys.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.558
I would like to hear
about the beautiful flower.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.993
I will tell you
about the beautiful flower.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.461
It's a clown flower.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.231
Whenever i am feeling sad
in this world,

12:46.233 --> 12:49.300
I look at the flower
and it makes me happy.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.103
Oh, i would like to be happy.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.106
Mr. Jingles, is there any way
you would even consider

12:55.108 --> 12:57.008
Allowing me to look
at the pretty flower?

12:57.010 --> 12:59.043
Is she for real?

12:59.045 --> 13:02.080
I try, i try, and i try.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.349
I'll take it from here.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.683
You won't have to.
Watch this!

13:05.685 --> 13:08.219
I wanna look
at the pretty flower!

13:09.956 --> 13:11.990
-She's like a gift.
-Ah, just do it.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.996
This flower is of the species
carnatious in your facious.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.098
Where's it from?
Where's it from?

13:20.100 --> 13:23.067
You know, i just don't
have the heart.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.536
She deserves it. Do it!

13:24.538 --> 13:26.070
(clears throat)

13:26.072 --> 13:26.971
Made in china.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.040
Look closer.
Here we go.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.710
Aah!

13:32.712 --> 13:34.445
What's the matter, honey?

13:34.447 --> 13:35.680
Did something happen?

13:38.718 --> 13:40.452
Mr. Jingles...

13:40.453 --> 13:42.187
May i please borrow
your clown handkerchief

13:42.189 --> 13:44.355
-To dry myself off?
-Sure, kid.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.876
(sighs)

13:47.877 --> 13:49.460
You know, it's not like
i'm gonna be a clown
my whole life.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.230
My circusin' just got
in the way of my...

13:52.232 --> 13:54.132
Formal education.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.536
How do i look?

13:58.538 --> 14:00.238
Smart.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.476
Yeah, but now we got
this volunteer teacher

14:05.478 --> 14:07.145
Who dedicates
his free time

14:07.147 --> 14:08.713
To enriching
our clown minds.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.448
I wonder who the teacher is.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.150
Who is he? Who?

14:13.787 --> 14:15.153
Hey, jingles.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.023
I'll see you next week.
Hey, girls.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.792
(heroic music playing)

14:20.794 --> 14:23.494
Trapeze!

14:23.496 --> 14:25.797
Home!

14:25.799 --> 14:27.332
Now, if he was your father,

14:27.334 --> 14:30.134
I could understand
why you'd wanna...

14:30.136 --> 14:31.736
Oh, you poor kid.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.175
My parents are superheroes.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.244
Calm down, blinky.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.646
She saves orphanages
and bookstores,

14:41.648 --> 14:44.215
And he dedicates
his life to clowns.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.150
What do i do?

14:46.152 --> 14:48.353
You make your bed.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.054
Not really.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.423
All i do is just
pull the comforter
up over everything.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.696
Get out of here!

15:00.166 --> 15:02.133
But this is where
the spaghetti is!

15:10.110 --> 15:12.176
-Riley--
-i can't compete
with them, maya.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.712
I have reached
my personal horizon line.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.030
There's nowhere
for me to go.

15:16.031 --> 15:17.347
Honey, you gotta
get 'em out of your head.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.383
I can't.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.118
I know all of their stories.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.453
They keep on repeating
over and over.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.655
Were they always so perfect?

15:23.657 --> 15:25.190
What?

15:25.191 --> 15:26.724
Sure, they're great now,
but how were they
at our age?

15:26.726 --> 15:29.360
I bet they were
just as messed up
and confused as we are.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.096
Maybe we should see
that for ourselves.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.982
How would we do that?

15:33.983 --> 15:35.867
They've told me
their stories a million times.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.535
Maybe if we try
and pick one

15:37.537 --> 15:39.137
And imagine them
at our age,

15:39.139 --> 15:40.505
We'll discover
how they really were.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.140
Riley, how many times
have i told you

15:42.142 --> 15:43.675
To stop being so innocent?

15:43.677 --> 15:45.810
I'm going to tell
you a story, maya.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.479
So, concentrate hard and maybe
we'll see how they were.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.281
Riles, i'm not gonna see
your parents as kids

15:50.283 --> 15:51.649
Because i concentrate.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.185
Once upon a time,
there was a cory and topanga.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.587
It's not like someone recorded
everything they did.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.156
Concentrate!

15:59.426 --> 16:02.226
And one day, topanga went
over to cory's house...

16:02.228 --> 16:04.462
May i ask you
a personal question?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.364
You tell
a good story, riley.

16:08.568 --> 16:09.867
Sure.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.271
Why are there socks
all over your floor?

16:13.273 --> 16:16.140
Oh, i was just practicing.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.575
This is where
my dad grew up. Look.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.644
I envy
your athletic ability.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.212
Oh, this?
It's not so hard.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.647
Come on, i'll give
you some pointers.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.683
Cory:
Anyway, the key is
good color commentary.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.285
This is where
it all began!

16:32.192 --> 16:33.658
Look at 'em.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.193
They're eensy!

16:35.195 --> 16:37.195
-Your dad's adorable.
-Maya!

16:37.197 --> 16:39.297
Hey, matthews,
how you doin'?

16:39.299 --> 16:40.798
Watch this.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.333
Matthews sees
an open lane,

16:42.335 --> 16:43.434
He drives hard
to the boards,

16:43.436 --> 16:45.269
He leaps
over shaquille o'neal,

16:45.271 --> 16:46.838
Kisses it off the glass...

16:46.840 --> 16:49.741
It's good!
He scores!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.378
I could never do that.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.213
Sure you can.
Give it a try.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.482
But i'm not familiar
with the terminology.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.317
All right, i'll do the color.
You just worry

16:59.319 --> 17:01.252
About getting the ball
in the basket.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.187
Topanga is triple-teamed
at the time line,

17:03.189 --> 17:04.822
She breaks a trap,
heads to the top

17:04.824 --> 17:06.524
Of the key and leaps
toward the basket,

17:06.526 --> 17:09.293
Doing a spiraling
tomahawk 360!

17:09.295 --> 17:11.262
Slam dunk!

17:20.340 --> 17:22.707
Look. We both made a basket.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.444
-Riles?
-Yeah?

17:26.446 --> 17:28.446
They were kids
just like us.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.483
Technically, yeah.
But basketball is so much

17:32.485 --> 17:34.519
More fun when
you actually move.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.221
All right, you try
and make another basket
and i'll try and block you.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.923
Look at him!
You dad's as weird as you.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.792
Yeah, he kind of is.

17:40.794 --> 17:42.460
But she's great even then.

17:42.462 --> 17:45.296
Yeah. Tough act to follow.

18:00.547 --> 18:04.248
Way to go, topanga!

18:04.250 --> 18:06.350
(giggles)

18:08.588 --> 18:11.322
Even when they were kids,
my parents were still perfect.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.792
I don't know
what to say.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.727
There's nothing
you can say, really.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.766
If it helps,
it seems like

18:21.768 --> 18:23.968
Your dad was
just as weird as you.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.270
You're just like him, riley.
And he turned out great.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.772
But did you see my mom?

18:27.774 --> 18:30.875
She was completely
together even then.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.944
What hope do i have?

18:37.584 --> 18:39.417
How can you beat
the impossible?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.419
Can you? Did you?
Is farkle an athlete now?

18:41.421 --> 18:42.386
Not as good as lucas.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.456
Oh. Well, will you ever be?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.008
Doesn't have to be.

18:47.009 --> 18:48.559
You don't have to be
a great athlete
to like the game.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.061
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.762
The fun of the game
is running the bases.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.631
Farkle, you actually ran?

18:56.369 --> 18:57.952
Nothin'.

18:57.953 --> 18:59.536
I don't get the moment,
but i'm very disappointed.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.441
Well, what happens
if you get home

19:03.443 --> 19:05.309
And realize you're not
as good as the rest of the team?

19:05.311 --> 19:06.477
You keep playing.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.645
It's a team sport, riley.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.097
You just run the bases.

19:09.098 --> 19:10.548
The rest of your team
will help you get home.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.460
You know, when you walked
me through their story,

19:22.462 --> 19:24.762
It's amazing to see how much
you and your dad are alike.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.097
Two goofs.

19:26.099 --> 19:29.333
Yeah, i'm definitely
his daughter.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.868
But that's not
the only story, riley.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.037
There's gotta be other
stories about your mom.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.939
She's perfect in every story.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.408
Yeah? Tell me another one
and we'll see.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.377
Maya, i don't wanna tell
you any more stories.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.012
They make me feel bad.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.646
Look, maybe if we go back,
we can find something else.

19:42.649 --> 19:46.017
There's gotta be something
that makes them goofy like us.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.786
I do know that
there were other bay windows.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.788
Really? Tell it to me.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.393
Once upon a time,
there was another bay window.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.461
Now this sounds
like a good story.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.898
I have some ideas
on our presentation.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.134
So do i.
Here's what we do.

20:03.136 --> 20:05.503
We hit feeny hard.
We hit him fast.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.138
The ozone layer--
it's got a hole.

20:07.140 --> 20:10.007
Wear a hat.
We're in. We're out.

20:10.009 --> 20:13.578
I kind of had a whole different
approach to the report.

20:13.580 --> 20:17.381
Less conventional,
more performance art.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.816
What's this story?

20:18.818 --> 20:20.418
What's the difference?

20:20.420 --> 20:21.652
My mom will still be perfect.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.423
No, please.
Let's stick to conventional.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.526
Conventional's good
because no one laughs
at conventional.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.863
Read this poem out loud.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.132
Poem?
Please, not a poem.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.903
(dramatic music playing)

20:38.905 --> 20:43.608
"sun. The only. The one.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.112
"donut in the sky.

20:48.114 --> 20:52.583
"space. Big gaping place.

20:52.585 --> 20:57.521
"without. Within. Our skin.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.423
"donut in the sky.

20:59.425 --> 21:02.059
"freon.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.698
"fluorocarbon.
Humpback whale.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.000
(laughs)

21:09.002 --> 21:10.968
Riley...

21:12.572 --> 21:14.438
Wow. She's goofier
than he is.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.607
She is. Isn't that great?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.510
"so pale. Exhaust.

21:19.512 --> 21:23.481
Is all lost?
Donut in the sky."

21:25.685 --> 21:27.485
Riley, she's you.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.553
Yeah, she is.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.988
You're both of them.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.623
I am.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.570
Yeah, we could do that
in front of the class,

21:46.572 --> 21:49.840
But before we do,
will you just please take

21:49.842 --> 21:52.576
A huge baseball bat
and hit me over the head?

21:52.578 --> 21:56.247
Why do you care so much
what other people think?

21:56.249 --> 21:57.882
When people laugh at you,

21:57.884 --> 22:00.818
They're depleting
their own karmic reservoir.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.653
You're gonna be one
of those girls

22:02.655 --> 22:04.822
Who doesn't shave
her legs, aren't you?

22:08.961 --> 22:10.928
I haven't decided yet.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.631
Do you actually
try to be weird?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.766
I don't think i'm weird.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.535
I think i'm unique.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.672
I don't think
i'm weird, maya.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.641
I think i'm unique.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.644
He's cory, she's topanga.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.679
But i'm both.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.253
I'm not going to fall
off the face of the earth.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.759
There is no end
to my horizon.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.098
My parents are
cory and topanga,

22:47.100 --> 22:50.534
And they gave me the best
parts of both of them.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.570
I'm not going to be
you or mom, dad.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.772
We don't want
you to be, riley.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.841
I'm going to have
my own stories.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.009
And i can't wait
to watch them.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.783
Riley?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.251
Yeah?

23:07.253 --> 23:08.652
Where'd you get that hat?

23:08.654 --> 23:11.188
Oh. You gave it
to me a long time ago.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.556
Don't you remember?

23:12.558 --> 23:15.059
No.

23:15.061 --> 23:18.195
It looks great on you.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.731
Thanks, dad.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.333
It's going to help
me run the bases.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.102
And i'm glad
i'm on your team.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.340
Excuse us.
