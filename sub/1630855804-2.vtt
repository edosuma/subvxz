[Abbot] This so-called Revolution,

00:23.458 --> 00:27.000
it's not a struggle for the rights of man.

00:28.083 --> 00:32.750
It's an abomination,
an affront to the natural order,

00:32.833 --> 00:34.541
to common decency,

00:35.791 --> 00:37.083
above all,

00:37.583 --> 00:40.625

the Knights of Saint John,

in the wars for the Holy Land,

She will raise
a holy army of the righteous

01:35.416 --> 01:37.666
to crush the blasphemers.

I'm a representative of

03:24.958 --> 03:25.791
[clatters]

03:28.875 --> 03:31.625
[Maria] I've heard about the revolution
in Saint-Domingue, of course,

03:31.708 --> 03:34.208
but the Paris papers
only reach here sometimes,

03:34.291 --> 03:36.333
and then about six months late.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.333
So I know the slaves rose up,
burned all the sugar plantations,

03:39.416 --> 03:41.708
and killed all the bastard slave owners.

03:41.791 --> 03:44.666
Not quite all. One escaped.

03:45.250 --> 03:47.166
Many white colonists were vampires.

03:47.250 --> 03:50.291
The island was teeming
with all kinds of evil.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.875
And it's not over yet, our revolution.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.958
We're still fighting.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.500
[exhales] I'll call a meeting.

03:57.583 --> 03:59.041
It will be so inspiring.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.958
Representatives from another revolution.

-Annette was.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.625
I was an opera singer.

04:06.458 --> 04:07.291
Oh my God.

04:07.791 --> 04:08.625
This bread.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.291
We've been living off ship rations
for weeks.

04:13.375 --> 04:17.541
If I never eat another strip
of dried meat for as long as I live…

04:17.625 --> 04:20.625
[chuckling] Yeah, and fuck knows
what kind of meat it even is.

04:20.708 --> 04:22.166
You've spent time on a ship?

04:23.375 --> 04:25.958
I sailed here from Boston
when I was a boy.

04:26.041 --> 04:28.416
-Worst few weeks of my life.
-[chuckles]

04:29.000 --> 04:33.541
I didn't think it was humanly possible
to vomit so often.

04:33.625 --> 04:34.500
Nor did I.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.083
Annette found my suffering hilarious.

04:37.166 --> 04:40.500
[chuckling] Everything's an opera,
even puking over the side of a ship.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.125
[laughing]

04:45.833 --> 04:48.291
Tell me what you know
about this Vampire Messiah.

04:49.541 --> 04:53.750
In Saint-Domingue, there's a mambo,
a priestess, my teacher.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.750
She's a powerful sorcerer and seer.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.625
It was she who told me to find you.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.333
[Richter] And she knows
about this Messiah?

05:01.916 --> 05:05.791
She said, "Something is changing
out here in the Old World."

05:06.375 --> 05:10.000
For centuries, vampires have lived
coiled around the old houses of Europe,

05:10.083 --> 05:11.125
like vines.

05:11.208 --> 05:14.416
Close allies of the dukes and barons,
the principalities,

05:14.500 --> 05:16.708
even the royal courts themselves.

05:16.791 --> 05:18.416
That's amazing.

05:19.250 --> 05:23.291
But many vampires resented
their reliance on human kings and princes.

05:24.041 --> 05:27.958
This Messiah promises to make them
unquestioned masters of the world.

05:28.041 --> 05:29.500
Won't that be fun.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.875
They'll leave
the kings and princes in place,

05:31.958 --> 05:34.458
but with vampires pulling the strings,

05:34.541 --> 05:37.000
which means, first,
they need to crush the Revolution.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.791
[Maria] Oh, what a surprise.

05:38.875 --> 05:41.458
The evil Messiah
is on the side of the old regime.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.583
The priestess told me you could do magic.

05:50.041 --> 05:50.875
I don't know.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.041
Never mind. We'll make do.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.583
The Messiah was a monster
before she was a vampire.

06:02.666 --> 06:03.541
She?

06:03.625 --> 06:06.916
Even as a human, she tortured
and murdered young girls and boys.

06:07.625 --> 06:11.375
[Tera] What's her name?
The Vampire Messiah, do you know her name?

06:12.500 --> 06:14.208
-Erzsebet Bathory.

I never really told you
why I fled from Russia.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.583
You… said you had no choice.

07:45.458 --> 07:46.291
That's true.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.166
But I never really told you
who I had to leave behind.

07:51.416 --> 07:53.541
I thought-- I hoped…

07:54.375 --> 07:58.000
that it was locked away in the past
and far away in the East…

07:58.875 --> 08:00.416
and you were safe from it.

08:00.916 --> 08:02.416
But of course you're not safe.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.291
I was born 4,000 miles to the east,
in Russia,

08:08.000 --> 08:09.625
by the banks of a great river.

08:09.708 --> 08:10.833
[solemn music playing]

08:11.458 --> 08:14.708
[Tera] People were poor, cruelly treated.

08:15.916 --> 08:18.750
So, my family, a clan of Speakers,

08:19.458 --> 08:22.416
settled there for a while
to help ease their suffering.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.791
And for a while, we were free.

08:26.541 --> 08:29.125
But, of course,
our freedom couldn't be tolerated.

Not yet.

She won't want simply
to crush the Revolution,

14:06.500 --> 14:07.458
We'll be safe.

14:12.000 --> 14:12.916
[music fades]

14:13.000 --> 14:14.375
[leaves rustling]

14:17.208 --> 14:20.541
[Maria] Thousands of years ago,
before any church or anything,

14:20.625 --> 14:23.958
the people who built stone circles
communed with what they called

14:24.041 --> 14:25.166
the Otherworld.

14:25.250 --> 14:28.416
Sounds like the spirit world,
where Annette's ancestors live.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.541
Generation upon generation of ancestors,

14:31.625 --> 14:34.500
back to Ogun, an orisha, a god.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.250
The god of iron and war.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.333
She's descended from a god?

14:39.916 --> 14:41.375
That's on my father's side.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.708
[Edouard chuckles]

14:43.333 --> 14:45.166
On her mother's, it's Orunmila,

14:46.041 --> 14:48.333
an orisha of wisdom and divination.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.166
Apparently.

14:51.166 --> 14:54.250
Anyway, it gives her power
over metal and rock.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.750
We're all descended from gods.

14:56.833 --> 14:59.541
We just have to learn
how to draw on their power.

14:59.625 --> 15:03.166
Well, I'm quite happy with my whip
and my knives, thank you.

15:03.250 --> 15:07.708
Generation upon generation of my ancestors
have killed vampires with just this whip.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.791
Actually, quite a lot of them
could do magic,

15:10.875 --> 15:13.750
including my mother,
but it's never been essential.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.375
Where's your mother?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.000
[Richter] She died.

15:19.916 --> 15:21.541
Some vampires do magic too.

15:23.041 --> 15:25.375
[ominous music playing]

15:25.458 --> 15:27.458
[thunder rumbling]

[thunder rumbling]

16:07.666 --> 16:10.166
[playing exciting classical music]

16:16.333 --> 16:19.666
It's like Versailles emptied,
and its dregs washed up here.

16:19.750 --> 16:20.583
That's him.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.833
That's the Marquis.

16:24.791 --> 16:25.625
Poor devils.

16:29.875 --> 16:31.500
He's giving them the corpses.

16:31.583 --> 16:33.625
-Why?
-To make more.

16:33.708 --> 16:36.916
The Marquis has some kind of deal
with the Forgemaster.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.250
Follow those night creatures,
we find their maker.

16:40.041 --> 16:40.916
[gasps]

16:41.500 --> 16:42.375
It's Jacques.

16:45.791 --> 16:47.625
I saw him only yesterday.

16:48.958 --> 16:49.833
Oh my God.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.166
[Edouard] It's the vampire
who enslaved her and murdered her mother,

16:54.250 --> 16:55.416
the Comte de Vaublanc.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.875
He looks like he's found God.

16:59.375 --> 17:02.541
Papa Legba, open the gate.

17:03.541 --> 17:05.291
[Edouard] Annette, not now.

17:06.916 --> 17:07.750
Annette.

17:10.791 --> 17:11.791
