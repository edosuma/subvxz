WEBVTT

00:05.906 --> 00:08.276
Tonight on "Shark Tank"...

00:08.309 --> 00:11.479
We handle the tech so that
our couples can handle the love.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.647
This is not a business.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.116
You will not run this
as a business.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.250
- Ouch.
- Ohh.

00:16.284 --> 00:19.287
We are in position
to blow this company up.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.655
What I'm offering you,
it's like gold.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.959
I sleep naked,
and so --

00:25.993 --> 00:27.228
- Now we're really concerned.
- Wait. Wait.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.829
- No.
- No!

00:28.862 --> 00:30.664
I don't have
this problem.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.301
You came here on "Shark Tank"
to sell the Sharks.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.770
Now you've got these two
selling <i>you.</i>

00:36.804 --> 00:41.008
Let's get it.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.515
First in the Tank

00:47.548 --> 00:50.418
is a modern way
to celebrate your union.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.861
Hi, Sharks.
My name's Caroline Creidenberg.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.331
I'm from Denver, Colorado,
and I'm here today

01:03.364 --> 01:07.201
seeking $200,000
for 5% of my company.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.103
- Wow.
- Oh-ho.

01:09.137 --> 01:12.606
Sharks, weddings
are amazing, right?

01:12.640 --> 01:15.476
A beautiful couple,
madly in love,

01:15.509 --> 01:17.345
shedding happy tears together.

01:17.378 --> 01:20.914
But what happens
when the unexpected

01:20.948 --> 01:23.917
makes everything
come crashing down?

01:23.951 --> 01:26.086
I'm talking about
the pandemic.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.688
Life was brought to a halt,

01:27.721 --> 01:29.890
and couples
were forced to postpone

01:29.923 --> 01:32.092
or cancel their big day.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.661
So what did I do?

01:33.694 --> 01:36.197
I created the ultimate solution

01:36.230 --> 01:38.799
to allow couples
to still tie the knot

01:38.832 --> 01:40.901
and live happily ever after.

01:40.934 --> 01:45.139
Introducing Wedfuly, the best
wedding you'll ever go to.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.107
But get this --
guests can attend

01:47.141 --> 01:51.379
all from the comfort
of their home, hot tub,

01:51.412 --> 01:54.515
or anywhere around the world.

01:54.548 --> 01:58.952
Wedfuly helps plan and produce
elaborate, engaging, creative,

01:58.986 --> 02:04.692
and virtual -- yes, Sharks,
I said virtual -- weddings.

02:04.725 --> 02:08.996
We handle the tech so that
our couples can handle the love.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.366
But this isn't just
a lifeless live stream.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.935
Wedfuly weddings are full
of interactive moments

02:14.968 --> 02:17.471
like our crowd-favorite
group dance

02:17.505 --> 02:20.974
that leave guests
and the couple truly wowed.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.310
Guests have a front-row seat

02:22.343 --> 02:24.612
regardless of where
they're attending from

02:24.645 --> 02:27.381
and can be dressed fancy on top
and comfy on bottom --

02:27.415 --> 02:30.150
PJ's, undies, no problem.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.152
Want to know the best part?

02:32.186 --> 02:34.488
After just a few
virtual weddings,

02:34.522 --> 02:38.492
we quickly realized this isn't
just the pandemic fix,

02:38.526 --> 02:41.262
but simply a better way
to get married.

02:41.295 --> 02:44.131
Weddings are stressful
and expensive,

02:44.164 --> 02:45.499
but with Wedfuly,

02:45.533 --> 02:47.368
celebrating your marriage
is accessible

02:47.401 --> 02:49.503
to you and your guests.

02:49.537 --> 02:53.006
So, Sharks, which one of you
wants to say I do

02:53.040 --> 02:55.108
and help couples
around the world

02:55.142 --> 02:57.345
have their cake and eat it, too?

02:58.379 --> 03:00.414
So, Sharks, to get you
all in the wedding mood,

03:00.448 --> 03:02.216
you each have a piece of cake

03:02.250 --> 03:04.184
and a glass of champagne
in front of you.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.686
Let's toast.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.954
To the Chevaliers
du Tastevin.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.489
Wait, wait.
One, two, three.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.358
Chevaliers du Tastevin!

03:10.391 --> 03:11.625
Yay!

03:12.893 --> 03:14.695
Alright.
So, here's my thoughts.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.597
I believe that weddings
are a time to celebrate.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.867
I believe after being
locked up for years,

03:19.900 --> 03:22.202
we're all gonna want to
do that more in person.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.238
I don't like your valuation.
I'm out.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.541
Take back his cake.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.676
- That's totally fine.
- Thanks for the cake.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.378
You enjoy that cake.
You enjoy that champagne.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.146
You want to hear
a fun fact?

03:33.180 --> 03:34.582
Yes.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.685
The first wedding ever streamed
in video online

03:37.718 --> 03:39.086
was my brother Brian's...

03:39.119 --> 03:42.490
What?
...in 1998.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.557
Really?
Yep.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.792
Wait,
how do you know that?

03:44.825 --> 03:46.860
Because I helped start
the whole streaming industry.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.128
That's how I made my money
with AudioNet.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.730
But how do you know
it was the very first one?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.932
Because we did all the streaming
at the time.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.166
Oh.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.201
Caroline,
I-I love weddings.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.136
People love weddings.
Yeah.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.805
To Daymond's point...
Yeah.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.773
...don't you think the last
thing people want to do

03:59.807 --> 04:02.776
is have more video weddings
after the pandemic?

04:02.810 --> 04:03.911
Totally. Totally.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.112
And I think
there is an industry

04:05.145 --> 04:06.514
that works for those people.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.016
But I think it's super important
to understand

04:09.049 --> 04:11.719
who we saw get married last year
using Wedfuly.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.988
So, 40% of our couples
chose Wedfuly

04:15.022 --> 04:16.790
because it just fit
their needs, right?

04:16.824 --> 04:19.960
How many weddings
did you perform on Wedfuly?

04:19.993 --> 04:22.563
We've performed 700
since March of 2020.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.765
That's not bad.
So, I am in
the wedding industry

04:24.798 --> 04:28.201
in many, many different levels
and points of reference.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.070
I own many companies
that service it.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.171
I've lived
through the pandemic.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.906
I understand exactly
what's going on.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.410
The issue you have
with this deal before --

04:36.444 --> 04:38.712
'cause 700 is nothing,
not that I --

04:38.746 --> 04:41.014
Can I finish really quickly
telling you about the 40%?

04:41.048 --> 04:42.416
Please do, 'cause I'm about to
eviscerate you.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.552
Great.
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.753
Before you get to
the money,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.588
were you in
the wedding business before,

04:47.621 --> 04:49.323
or how did you get to this?

04:49.357 --> 04:51.959
Yeah, so my background's
actually software engineering.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.528
Okay.
So before this,
I was working

04:54.562 --> 04:57.064
at a big financial corporation
as a software engineer.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.400
You probably didn't expect me
to say I'm a software engineer

04:59.433 --> 05:01.535
when I walked in here,
and so, yeah --

05:01.569 --> 05:03.371
I expected it because,
you know --

05:03.404 --> 05:04.738
Yeah, 'cause women
can do everything.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.173
So many women can do that.
That's right.

05:06.206 --> 05:09.109
When I was working at that
big financial corporation,

05:09.142 --> 05:12.513
I was one of three women
in a 60-person company.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.147
So I started looking
for an industry

05:14.181 --> 05:17.385
where I could still use
my software engineering degree

05:17.418 --> 05:20.521
but have a culture
where I felt like I fit in more.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.691
And weddings is obviously
totally very female dominated,

05:23.724 --> 05:25.659
except for Mr. Wonderful here.

05:26.794 --> 05:27.928
He doesn't fit.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.766
Then I built an app to work
with wedding planners,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.935
and while working with them,

05:34.968 --> 05:37.505
this is when I realized that
the traditional wedding industry

05:37.538 --> 05:39.339
does not fit all types.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.141
On the market, it's like
courthouse wedding

05:41.174 --> 05:42.342
or big blowout.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.611
You know, minimum,
the average wedding

05:43.644 --> 05:45.679
costs $30,000 in the US, right?

05:45.713 --> 05:48.716
What we saw last year
was that 40% of our couples

05:48.749 --> 05:50.017
didn't have a wedding planned,

05:50.050 --> 05:52.586
had no intention to have
the big white wedding.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.021
And then when
they read about us --

05:54.054 --> 05:55.889
because we've been featured
in <i>The New York Times,</i>

05:55.923 --> 05:58.258
I've been on "The Today Show,"
we've been in <i>Vogue, Brides --</i>

05:58.291 --> 06:00.193
it would click for them.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.462
How does it work?
Yeah, yeah.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.863
I sign up.
What happens next?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.364
Yep. So you sign up,
you go through our --

06:04.398 --> 06:07.200
our process called
the Wedfuly Guide and Workbook,

06:07.234 --> 06:10.137
which really tees you up
to be fully prepared.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.805
And then on the day
of the wedding,

06:11.839 --> 06:13.173
it's super exciting, right?

06:13.206 --> 06:16.009
So we have, like,
this multimedia experience.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.178
It's almost like a museum
of the couple.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.947
As you enter
the Zoom waiting room,

06:19.980 --> 06:22.315
there's either, like, a video
playing about how they met

06:22.349 --> 06:25.218
or a slide show,
a custom playlist playing.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.086
And then once the wedding
starts,

06:26.119 --> 06:27.721
we have this multi-angle --

06:27.755 --> 06:29.657
You really do get
a front-row seat.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.560
The equipment is all tripods,
cellphones, super low tech,

06:32.593 --> 06:34.394
and then we are
100% remote, right?

06:34.428 --> 06:36.296
So we've done weddings
all over the world

06:36.329 --> 06:37.965
because we can do
a wedding wherever.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.134
Okay, how many can you handle
on a Saturday?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.937
So, last year, we did -- one
Saturday, we did 30 weddings.

06:43.971 --> 06:44.938
- Okay.
- Wow.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.073
But the beauty
of what we've done

06:46.106 --> 06:47.407
and why we're such a good team

06:47.441 --> 06:49.810
is that we're super amazing
on the operations side

06:49.843 --> 06:51.411
and we're able to scale up
and scale back

06:51.445 --> 06:53.080
as the weddings
come through the door.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.548
What actually
did you develop?

06:54.582 --> 06:56.216
Is it the production
and the switching

06:56.249 --> 06:57.751
and the mixing side of it
or what?

06:57.785 --> 07:00.287
No, the actual
planning process itself

07:00.320 --> 07:02.723
is where the tech
and the proprietary tech lies.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.659
Okay, so explain that to me.
So we've built out,
like, this guide flow

07:05.693 --> 07:07.561
almost kind of like a data --
a bit data science-y,

07:07.595 --> 07:09.863
where it's, like, taking in
all these data points

07:09.897 --> 07:11.098
about what their wedding is.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.299
So, Caroline, here's what
I'm trying to figure out.

07:12.332 --> 07:15.202
On one hand,
you're a wedding planner, right?

07:15.235 --> 07:18.171
Then the reason I'm asking the
questions about the technology

07:18.205 --> 07:21.575
is I'm trying to figure out,
are you also a data company?

07:21.609 --> 07:22.976
Can you get
more information?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.978
Because if you become
a data company,

07:25.012 --> 07:26.413
what are you aggregating?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.181
How deep is your database?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.484
Because that is really
what matters.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.352
Yeah. And to answer
that question,

07:32.385 --> 07:34.121
we're aggregating, like,
every single little detail

07:34.154 --> 07:35.589
about their wedding

07:35.623 --> 07:36.690
down to, like, how many people
are attending.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.292
We collect their guest list,
which we don't --

07:39.326 --> 07:41.161
We don't do any--
Are you capturing
the birth dates

07:41.194 --> 07:42.996
or any information
about the attendees,

07:43.030 --> 07:44.698
the 200 that are attending?

07:44.732 --> 07:46.266
We're collecting
their first name,

07:46.299 --> 07:49.369
last name,
and e-mail right now.

07:49.402 --> 07:53.473
Caroline, the -- the geeks here
are asking important questions,

07:53.507 --> 07:55.809
but you're asking for
$200,000 for 5%,

07:55.843 --> 07:58.579
saying that your business
is worth $4 million.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.081
Yeah.
What was the last year
of business

08:01.114 --> 08:03.517
and year to date
of sales?

08:03.551 --> 08:05.953
So, when we started on March --

08:05.986 --> 08:07.588
in March of 2020
until now,

08:07.621 --> 08:09.156
we've done $1 million in sales.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.924
- Whoa.
- Fabulous.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.292
Okay,
and on that $1 million,

08:12.325 --> 08:13.861
were you profitable
in sales you had?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.063
Yeah, last year, we did
$700,000, we made $100,000.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.097
This year, we'll do
about $1 million

08:17.130 --> 08:18.566
and we'll make $300,000.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.268
So our average revenue
per customer is $1,500.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.304
Our two base packages
are $800 to $1,200,

08:24.337 --> 08:26.073
and then we have
a whole menu of add-ons

08:26.106 --> 08:27.941
that couples can choose from

08:27.975 --> 08:30.343
to up, like, whatever they want
for their wedding.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.145
What are you making
on the $1,500?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.614
What's your profit margin
on that?

08:33.647 --> 08:35.182
75%.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.750
Have you raised
any money?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.686
No, I own
100% of the company.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.087
Good for you.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.956
Okay, the only way this works
for me goes back to the data.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.458
I have a lot of other companies
that service weddings.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.394
Yeah.
This works for me.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.596
I don't think
you're worth $4 million,

08:48.629 --> 08:51.198
but it's an interesting
data feeder business...

08:51.231 --> 08:52.399
100%.
...if you're willing to work
with the other companies

08:52.432 --> 08:54.868
so that we could sell
your weddings

08:54.902 --> 08:56.804
all of our other stuff.
Yeah.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.606
They are my customers,
okay?

08:58.639 --> 09:01.341
They are the people that I sell
Love Pop greeting cards to,

09:01.374 --> 09:04.945
and I also set up accounts for
at Honeyfund.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.380
Yeah.
That really matters to me.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.918
Alright?
I want 20% for $200,000.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.686
You're not doing this
for free, okay?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.155
There will be
an economic relationship.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.958
This is a feeder business
to each other.
Mm-hmm.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.560
There's a synergy here
just on those two businesses.
Yeah, makes total sense.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.963
There's others, but those are
the two I want to start with.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.164
Okay.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.066
That's my offer.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.400
Thank you so much.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.770
Very, very flattered.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.538
Would you do...

09:31.571 --> 09:33.506
$200,000 for 10%?

09:34.842 --> 09:38.211
No. I'm gonna bring
so much value to this business.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.681
Look, I track the wedding
industry by the weekend.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.783
Okay?
I get all that data.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.417
Well, let me tell you
what I think.
And there's a huge
scalability issue.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.186
Wait a minute.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.162
One Shark is out.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.264
Caroline has an offer from Kevin

09:57.297 --> 09:59.733
for her virtual wedding business
Wedfuly,

09:59.767 --> 10:01.769
but Lori may also be interested.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.706
Wait a minute.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.175
Listen, what I love
with you here today

10:08.208 --> 10:09.677
is actually your story.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.545
You are a great role model
for everybody watching.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.382
But this isn't
the right business for me.

10:15.415 --> 10:18.085
And so unfortunately,
I'm out.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.420
But I appreciate you
standing there.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.155
Thank you, Lori.
Girl power.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.191
You changed my life, too,
seeing you up here.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.592
Oh, well, thank you.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.995
Caroline, one of
the challenges that I see

10:28.028 --> 10:29.562
is scale, right?
Yeah.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.265
And so it's not a question,
"Can you execute?"

10:32.299 --> 10:33.801
I think it's a question,
as an investor,

10:33.834 --> 10:35.502
"How much can you scale?"

10:35.535 --> 10:38.371
You know, I don't have
the ancillary businesses

10:38.405 --> 10:41.274
that create revenue
that will justify an investment.
Right. Yeah.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.943
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.544
Okay.
Thank you, Mark.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.480
Hey, Caroline,
you're a great operator.

10:47.514 --> 10:50.250
And I think you're
gonna figure it out.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.054
I'm gonna make you an offer.

10:56.356 --> 11:00.493
Kevin offered you $200,000
for 20%.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.863
Your comeback was...?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.497
$200,000 for 10%.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.606
I'll do that deal.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.508
Okay. Let's do it!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.179
Snatched it
out of Kevin's mouth.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.281
- He did. Absolutely.
- Yay!

11:21.314 --> 11:22.682
Three, two, one.
Three, two, one.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.085
Whoo!
Hey!

11:25.118 --> 11:26.754
Thanks, Caroline. Congrats.
Thanks, everyone.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.155
Whoo-hoo!

11:28.188 --> 11:30.090
I can't wait to continue
to prove people wrong,

11:30.123 --> 11:32.092
and I think it's super exciting

11:32.125 --> 11:35.729
to welcome
our first male partner.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.998
Kevin, you know what I love
about all your wedding offers?

11:38.031 --> 11:41.735
You want to buy everybody's
e-mail address and phone number.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.804
Kevin, what are you
spamming people with

11:43.837 --> 11:45.605
when you get their --
their information?

11:51.578 --> 11:52.746
In Season 11,

11:52.780 --> 11:55.082
Samy Kobrosly
made a deal with Mark Cuban

11:55.115 --> 11:57.550
for his healthy snack chips
company, Snacklins.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.487
I'm a Muslim,
first-generation American

12:00.520 --> 12:02.222
pitching a vegan pork rind
on "Shark Tank."

12:02.255 --> 12:03.857
If that's not
the American dream,

12:03.891 --> 12:04.992
I don't know what is.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.927
Let's see
what he's up to now.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.361
Before "Shark Tank,"

12:08.395 --> 12:10.463
we could barely keep up
with production.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.099
We were still doing
everything by hand,

12:12.132 --> 12:14.167
and on top of that, we weren't
even a profitable company.

12:14.201 --> 12:18.138
We were averaging like
$5,000 a week on online sales.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.307
And within one week of
airing on "Shark Tank,"

12:20.340 --> 12:22.709
we had like $100,000 in sales,

12:22.742 --> 12:24.677
more sales than
we'd ever gotten before.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.613
It was --

12:26.646 --> 12:28.782
To keep up with demand,
we had to expand our facility.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.583
We have tripled

12:30.617 --> 12:32.119
the amount of team members
that we have

12:32.152 --> 12:33.787
from 10 to 30.

12:33.821 --> 12:37.257
Snacklins has expanded to
2,500 stores nationwide.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.292
Everything from Whole Foods
to Giant

12:39.326 --> 12:41.761
to Stop & Shop
to Erewhon to Gelson's.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.064
In just two years,
Snacklins has surpassed

12:44.097 --> 12:47.334
$5.3 million in sales.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.735
You can dip them
in anything.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.338
They don't crack.
They don't break.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.173
But they taste good.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.975
When someone comes in
with a food product,

12:55.008 --> 12:56.576
the first thing I do
is look at the nutrition label.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.378
Is it low-cal?
Is it healthy for you?

12:58.411 --> 13:00.213
Is there some other feature
of the product

13:00.247 --> 13:01.614
that makes it
different and unique

13:01.648 --> 13:03.183
and will make people
want to buy it?

13:03.216 --> 13:06.086
With Snacklins,
it was only 80 calories per bag,

13:06.119 --> 13:07.520
but they're like scoopers.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.756
It just had these unique
features that I just loved.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.325
You're really creating a great
experience for everybody.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.661
And for me as a Shark,
this is a great investment.

13:14.694 --> 13:17.297
I'm really appreciating
all the work you guys do.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.932
The reason I'm so dedicated

13:18.966 --> 13:20.667
and honestly,
the most important thing to me

13:20.700 --> 13:24.471
is seeing how Snacklins
has helped other people out

13:24.504 --> 13:26.739
by offering better work,
by offering better jobs,

13:26.773 --> 13:28.808
and by offering a better product

13:28.842 --> 13:30.510
for a price
that we can all afford.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.881
As a Tunisian-American,
I can tell you

13:33.914 --> 13:36.083
something like this
can only happen

13:36.116 --> 13:37.885
in a country like America.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.420
I just hope that other people
out there can look at this

13:40.453 --> 13:42.789
and realize that
you can follow your dreams

13:42.822 --> 13:44.892
and you can make something
out of nothing.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.393
That's just the American way.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.406
Next up is a solution

13:59.439 --> 14:02.675
to a common frustration
when doing the laundry.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.585
Hi. I'm Cyndi
from Denver, Colorado.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.923
I'm seeking $200,000
for 5% of my company.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.157
Wow.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.759
Sharks, there is
a maddening problem

14:19.792 --> 14:23.563
laundry doers face every time
they wash their sheets.

14:23.596 --> 14:27.200
That problem is dealing with
the terrible wad trio.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.502
First up, the tornado wad.

14:30.904 --> 14:31.871
Yeah.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.976
That tangled mess
isn't clean.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.112
Next, we have
the hostage-taker wad,

14:39.146 --> 14:42.515
where soggy items get trapped
in the fitted sheet.
Ohh. Hate that.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.884
And then there's
the burrito wad,

14:44.918 --> 14:46.286
where one sheet wraps itself

14:46.319 --> 14:48.355
around everything else
in the load

14:48.388 --> 14:51.591
and nothing inside dries.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.493
There has never been a solution

14:53.526 --> 14:56.263
to this wasteful
and annoying problem...

14:56.296 --> 14:57.330
until now.

14:58.698 --> 15:03.370
Introducing my invention --
Wad-Free for Bed Sheets,

15:03.403 --> 15:07.774
the first-ever wad preventer
for the washing machine

15:07.807 --> 15:09.342
and the dryer.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.979
Wad-Free attaches
to the four corners

15:12.012 --> 15:13.713
of both the flat
and the fitted sheet

15:13.746 --> 15:16.149
before you put them
in the washing machine

15:16.183 --> 15:20.187
where the load runs wad-free!

15:20.220 --> 15:21.721
Everything comes out cleaner,

15:21.754 --> 15:24.757
and the washer
won't go off-balance.

15:24.791 --> 15:29.529
Then you transfer it to the
dryer where it runs wad-free!

15:29.562 --> 15:31.498
Drying the first time,

15:31.531 --> 15:35.068
up to 75% faster
with fewer wrinkles,

15:35.102 --> 15:40.807
saving consumers time,
money, energy, and sanity.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.676
So, Sharks, don't get
your sheets in a wad.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.345
Join me, and we'll get Wad-Free

15:45.378 --> 15:48.415
into laundry rooms
across America,

15:48.448 --> 15:50.717
and we'll turn wads of sheets

15:50.750 --> 15:54.387
into wads of cash.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.189
Yay!

15:56.223 --> 15:58.491
- Good job.
- Yeah. Great job.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.659
O'
Quick question here.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.195
Now, here's what
I'm concerned about.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.464
I sleep naked,
and so --

16:04.497 --> 16:05.865
- Now we're really concerned.
- Wait. Wait.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.467
- No.
- No!

16:07.500 --> 16:09.136
I'm telling you the truth.

16:09.169 --> 16:13.406
And I buy the most expensive
Egyptian cotton

16:13.440 --> 16:16.543
the world makes --
thousands of dollars.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.712
Is this gonna damage
my fine Egyptian cotton

16:19.746 --> 16:21.781
when I'm jamming it up
into this clip?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.817
This is not going to damage
your sheets

16:24.851 --> 16:26.686
if you use it properly,

16:26.719 --> 16:29.222
and that includes following
the fabric care instructions

16:29.256 --> 16:30.923
of your sheets
as well as the product.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.560
So how long have you
been selling these?

16:33.593 --> 16:36.496
I launched in June of 2020.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.066
- And how much have you sold?
- So far, how much have you sold?

16:39.099 --> 16:43.903
I have sold $513,000

16:43.936 --> 16:45.405
since June of 2020.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.539
- Nice job.
- Wow.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.774
- Wow. You're kidding!
- Great job.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.908
And where did you
do those sales?

16:48.941 --> 16:50.810
That's amazing.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.412
I sell on my own website.

16:52.445 --> 16:56.015
I sell on Amazon,
Walmart, and The Grommet.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.750
What do you sell it for?

16:57.784 --> 17:01.388
My landed cost is $3.50.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.924
Plus I offer free shipping,
which is another $3.50.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.560
My retail price is $18.99.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.596
Your margins
are incredible.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.164
You make a lot of money
on these, don't you?

17:11.198 --> 17:14.567
My net profit -- 38%.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.669
- Yeah, nice job.
- Wow. Good for you.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.806
And is there a patent on this
or any type of protection?

17:19.839 --> 17:23.410
I have a utility patent
issuing next week.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.544
Oh, good for you.
Congrats.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.280
I also have a trademark
and copyright.

17:27.314 --> 17:29.082
Cyndi,
did you do this full-time?

17:29.116 --> 17:31.351
I'm all wads all the time.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.752
What did you do prior?

17:32.785 --> 17:35.888
My background is in advertising
and graphic design.

17:35.922 --> 17:41.294
I have an MBA, and I ran my own
company for almost 20 years,

17:41.328 --> 17:44.564
but I stopped working in 2005

17:44.597 --> 17:47.300
when my husband developed
a brain tumor.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.501
Oh.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.738
And since then,
I've been raising kids

17:51.771 --> 17:54.507
and volunteering in
the cancer community.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.009
A few months after
my husband passed away,

17:57.043 --> 17:58.778
"Shark Tank" premiered,

17:58.811 --> 18:00.413
and so I have a lot of years

18:00.447 --> 18:03.583
of watching inventors
bring their products to market

18:03.616 --> 18:06.619
and bring them here
to you on this carpet.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.955
You have all inspired me

18:08.988 --> 18:12.292
and given me the courage
to launch Wad-Free.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.860
- Good for you. Good for you.
- Congratulations.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.162
Thank you.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.363
I mean, it's really
quite something

18:16.396 --> 18:18.365
because it's a very
simple solution.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.600
Everybody has this problem.
I agree with you.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.535
I don't have this problem
'cause I rarely wash my sheets.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.870
Because you don't do
any laundry.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.139
I'm just not
a sheet washer.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.408
This is just not
my kind of thing.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.443
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.147
Cyndi, I got to tell you,
after 13 years,

18:34.181 --> 18:35.915
this is the reason I,

18:35.948 --> 18:37.917
and I know a lot of
the other Sharks, do the show.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.287
Hearing your story
inspires me.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.355
But, you know,
to Mark's point,

18:42.389 --> 18:44.391
I just don't understand
this market.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.493
I wouldn't even know what --
how to help you.

18:46.526 --> 18:49.962
It's --
It's not for me.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.165
I wish you all the best,
but I'm out.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.766
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.668
Okay.
I like simple solutions.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.904
I like the story.
Here's an offer.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.873
This is -- This is a classic
Mr. Wonderful royalty situation

19:00.907 --> 19:02.175
if I ever saw one.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.944
I'm gonna give you $200,000.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.980
I want 10% equity.
The royalty is not perpetual.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.349
I'm gonna charge you
$1.50,

19:09.382 --> 19:11.484
because you can afford it,
per unit.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.753
When I get a million bucks back,
it goes away

19:13.786 --> 19:16.756
and I'm just left being
a partner with you at 10%.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.358
You have an offer.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.927
Thank you.
I'm very grateful for the offer.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.795
And I like the offer.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.400
Do you mind if I see
if Daymond or Lori --

19:27.434 --> 19:29.736
Absolutely. There may be --
There may be other offers,

19:29.769 --> 19:31.103
and you deserve to hear them.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.705
You do.
And I have one.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.274
Ooh.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.382
Two Sharks are out.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.684
Cyndi has an offer on the table
from Kevin

19:44.717 --> 19:46.886
for her laundry product,
Wad-Free.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.389
But Lori also
seems interested.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.558
- So...
- Can I say something first?

19:51.591 --> 19:52.759
Sure, you can.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.761
You really did
an excellent job,

19:54.794 --> 19:57.196
but I just don't relate
to the product at all.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.197
So I'm out.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.666
Thank you.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.802
First off, genius product.
Thank you.

20:02.835 --> 20:07.173
The smartest ideas sometimes are
the simplest little products.

20:07.206 --> 20:11.110
They don't have to be big,
but you can sell millions.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.945
I don't know if you watched
last season,

20:12.979 --> 20:14.714
but I did a deal
with the Better Bedder.
Of course. Yes.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.549
Yes.
Super successful.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.185
And this is a perfect
complementary product.

20:19.218 --> 20:22.221
This is something we could
upsell with the Better Bedder.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.557
And I think we could do
an infomercial with this, too,

20:24.591 --> 20:26.593
and get in all the stores
nationwide.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.161
So my offer is a little
different than Kevin's.

20:29.195 --> 20:32.265
I'm gonna offer you
the $200,000,

20:32.299 --> 20:36.135
but I would like to be
a 25% partner.

20:36.168 --> 20:38.971
I-I know it sounds like a lot,
but let me tell you --

20:39.005 --> 20:40.907
Savage.
I can't --
I'm not a savage.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.510
I know how to make
millionaires.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.778
It's what I do.
So that's my offer.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.481
I want to be in it with you
day in, day out

20:48.515 --> 20:50.116
and blow this up.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.918
Cyndi, she just crushed
your valuation.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.120
25% is really greedy.

20:54.153 --> 20:55.722
- Cyndi, two offers.
- It's not greedy at all.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.956
He's saying that --

20:56.989 --> 21:00.760
He's saying that because
he wants you to take his.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.862
Can you tell me what
your paths would be, Lori?

21:02.895 --> 21:04.497
You said infomercial.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.866
So I think infomercial would be
a great route for you,

21:06.899 --> 21:09.302
but also digital advertising
and everywhere.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.103
And I can do exactly
the same thing.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.372
No, he can't.
After 13 years,

21:12.405 --> 21:14.507
I have so many products
in every big-box retailer.

21:14.541 --> 21:15.875
- Shark fight, Shark fight.
- No, he can't.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.411
One phone call -- Everybody
returns Mr. Wonderful's call.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.813
Yeah, they go, "Hello,
Mr. Wonderful?" Click.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.214
So you can just talk to
my CEOs and find out.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.516
Wait, Lori.
I gave you your pitch.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.617
Now I'm doing mine.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.286
Anything she can do,
I can do better.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.488
That's the way
I look at it.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.789
Cyndi,
think about this.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.792
You came here on "Shark Tank"
to sell the Sharks.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.928
Now you've got these two
selling <i>you.</i>

21:35.962 --> 21:37.263
How the tables have turned.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.865
You have two
great offers.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.601
It's really about how much
equity do you want to give up?

21:45.104 --> 21:46.873
Lori, would you do it
for 10%?

21:46.906 --> 21:48.408
Ohh.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.610
10%.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.113
You know, honestly,
what I'm offering you,

21:54.146 --> 21:56.315
it's like gold,
you know?

21:56.349 --> 21:57.717
I mean, I'm offering you
a direct...

21:57.750 --> 21:59.419
Just to keep it interesting,
Cyndi, let me modify my offer.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.620
...route to have
a partner --

22:00.653 --> 22:01.921
Let me modify my offer,
okay?

22:01.954 --> 22:05.858
Just to keep things swirling
in the Tank like a dryer.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.561
I'm gonna drop my equity take
to 5%,

22:08.595 --> 22:10.129
but I'm gonna keep
the royalty in place.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.064
But I don't --
It's not perpetual.

22:12.098 --> 22:15.334
I make a million bucks.
That's not too much to ask.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.203
And then I'm just
a 5% holder.

22:17.236 --> 22:19.372
So what's important to you?

22:19.406 --> 22:21.073
Do you want a partner
that's in there with you

22:21.107 --> 22:23.275
day in, day out,
fighting with you

22:23.309 --> 22:26.779
to make this be
a household name?

22:26.813 --> 22:28.681
Would you be doing
that fight, Kevin?

22:28.715 --> 22:30.149
Of course.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.183
What do you think
my incentive is

22:31.217 --> 22:32.719
with my entrepreneurs?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.320
To blow it up
as big as I can.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.288
It really boils down to how much
equity you want to give up.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.925
I have an MBA, too.
I understand equity.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.460
I really do.
You want to know something?

22:40.493 --> 22:42.094
That's why I'm very creative
with my structures.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.596
I try and find something
that's equitable

22:43.630 --> 22:44.764
between the entrepreneur
and me.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.399
Equity doesn't matter.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.967
Now, I don't like --
It doesn't matter

22:48.000 --> 22:49.335
if you're making millions.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.571
I really do not like greed.
I really do not like greed.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.873
And when I see Lori
getting greedy like this

22:53.906 --> 22:56.142
and putting a lot of pressure
on the deal --

22:56.175 --> 22:58.177
to make her be less greedy,
to be a better Lori,

22:58.210 --> 22:59.311
that's what I'm trying
to do for her.

22:59.345 --> 23:00.413
So, what would you like to do?

23:00.447 --> 23:03.315
Cyndi, I can't go to 10%.

23:03.349 --> 23:07.386
The lowest I'll go
is 20%.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.889
O'Ouch.
The lowest I'll go is 20%.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.524
That's like a laceration.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.701
Lori, I love you,

23:21.734 --> 23:24.537
but Mr. Wonderful,
I'm gonna take your deal.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.574
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

23:27.607 --> 23:29.509
Oh, Kevin killing it.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.944
You made the right decision.
My goodness!

23:31.978 --> 23:33.980
Kevin, your hate for Lori
paid off.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.214
Thank you.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.116
Just hating on her.
Wow.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.951
It was not
an easy decision.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.787
Lori is great.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.088
That was incredible.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.757
But I didn't want to give up
that much equity.

23:44.791 --> 23:48.995
Every laundry room across
America and across the globe --

23:49.028 --> 23:51.864
Wad-Free is coming to you.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.900
Wad-free days are here at last.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.736
Kevin, did not see
that happening.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.506
Neither did Kevin.
You snatched that deal
from Lori.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.574
Listen,
I cannot stand greed.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.876
I'm the knight
in shining armor.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.679
I just thought Kevin wanted the
money that was on the ground.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.256
Next up is what
the entrepreneur believes

24:17.289 --> 24:20.059
is the best way
to maximize your time.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.537
I don't see anything.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.905
Um...hello?

24:32.939 --> 24:34.306
Is it just my angle?

24:43.015 --> 24:44.717
Well, this is riveting.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.505
I got it from here.
Thank you.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.677
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Peter.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.945
I'm a software engineer
from York, Maine,

25:12.979 --> 25:15.414
and I'm here today
seeking $150,000

25:15.447 --> 25:18.918
in exchange for 20%
of my company, Beulr.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.220
But what is Beulr?

25:21.253 --> 25:23.590
Well, it's the first and only
product of its type.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.858
And essentially what we do
is allow our users

25:25.892 --> 25:28.895
to be in two places at once
or more.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.897
Any time you have
conflicting obligations --

25:30.930 --> 25:32.398
Me, for example,
I like to sleep in,

25:32.431 --> 25:33.866
but I did have to
be here today --

25:33.900 --> 25:35.702
well, I can use Beulr.

25:35.735 --> 25:41.107
Beulr is the application that
attends online meetings for you.

25:41.140 --> 25:45.277
That's right. It's the first
and only product of its type.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.614
To date, we've helped
tens of thousands of people

25:47.647 --> 25:51.083
around the globe avoid those
tedious online meetings

25:51.117 --> 25:52.518
where you kind of have to go,

25:52.551 --> 25:54.987
but at the same time,
you really don't need to.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.523
It is very simple to use.
Let me show you how it works.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.592
Once you've created an account
on Beulr,

25:59.626 --> 26:00.760
click "Schedule a bot,"

26:00.793 --> 26:02.061
and then enter
the meeting nickname,

26:02.094 --> 26:03.462
give it an ID and a password,

26:03.495 --> 26:04.897
copy and paste the meeting link,

26:04.931 --> 26:07.199
enter the days of the week
you'd like Beulr to arrive,

26:07.233 --> 26:10.102
what time to arrive,
and how long to stay for.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.304
From there, you can just upload
a video of yourself

26:12.338 --> 26:14.774
pretending to pay attention,
sipping your tea,

26:14.807 --> 26:16.909
you know,
having a good time,

26:16.943 --> 26:18.945
and then you're all set.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.179
Once you hit complete,

26:20.212 --> 26:21.714
you don't need to leave
your computer open.

26:21.748 --> 26:22.982
You don't need to leave
your laptop running

26:23.015 --> 26:24.383
or anything like that.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.218
All your online meetings
are attended through the cloud.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.321
So, Sharks,
who's ready to join me

26:29.355 --> 26:31.290
in helping the world
to log off,

26:31.323 --> 26:34.593
sleep in,
and be in two places at once?

26:34.627 --> 26:37.664
I thought that's what it was
until you actually said it.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.131
And this from "Ferris Bueller,"
right?

26:39.165 --> 26:41.668
"Bueller? Bueller?"
That's great.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.335
I wish this was out
when I was dating.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.938
So, I'm sleeping,
but my --

26:45.972 --> 26:47.539
What do you call me virtually?
An avatar?

26:47.573 --> 26:50.677
Your avatar, yeah.
My persona
is attending a meeting.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.145
Right.
And Mark asks me a question.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.181
Right.
I mean, I ignore him
the first time.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.083
Mark thinks it's normal.
Mm-hmm.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.185
He asks me again.
I still ignore him.

26:59.218 --> 27:02.021
How does Mark not figure out
it's not really me?

27:02.054 --> 27:03.155
Right, okay, so there's --

27:03.189 --> 27:04.490
there's two things there
that I'll say.

27:04.523 --> 27:07.459
The first is right now,
this is an MVP, right?

27:07.493 --> 27:09.128
Like, all it is
is a static video.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.063
MVP is
minimum viable product.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.098
It's a functioning
minimum viable product

27:12.131 --> 27:13.866
with tens of thousands
of users.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.169
But to address the question --

27:17.203 --> 27:18.738
I'm sorry, could you repeat it
one more time?

27:18.771 --> 27:21.373
It was --
Well, what if someone
asks you a question?

27:21.407 --> 27:22.675
He's so used to
not showing up,

27:22.709 --> 27:24.143
he doesn't even know
the question.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.980
Peter, are you in another place
right now?

27:28.014 --> 27:29.348
You would be surprised, yeah.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.950
So, okay, so if someone asks you
a question,

27:30.983 --> 27:32.484
right now,
it's a static video.

27:32.518 --> 27:34.153
It doesn't handle for
any sort of interaction.

27:34.186 --> 27:37.489
So all I'm getting today
is...

27:37.523 --> 27:39.058
A static video. Static video.
Static video.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.127
That's it?
That's it.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.494
O'- By the way,
I have to commit --
- Which is really
problematic.

27:42.528 --> 27:44.196
I have to commit the hour of
just sitting,

27:44.230 --> 27:45.932
sipping tea and stuff
to make that static video.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.299
No, it loops a video.
You can use a one-minute video.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.868
Oh, you can loop it.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.903
Yeah, but after two or
three meetings in your company,

27:50.937 --> 27:52.338
they're gonna, like --
Yeah, but it's not
for companies.

27:52.371 --> 27:53.740
"Why is he always doing
the same thing?"

27:53.773 --> 27:56.275
How did you get into this? How'd
you come up with this idea?

27:56.308 --> 27:58.945
Yeah, so when I was 12,
I took a computer science class.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.346
Absolutely fell in love with it.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.580
I've been building products
and whatnot ever since,

28:01.613 --> 28:03.382
and then I went to Tulane.

28:03.415 --> 28:04.984
I was on the path.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.485
I was interning
at Goldman Sachs.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.221
I was on track to graduate
summa cum laude.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.322
And then the pandemic.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.524
It was March 16th of 2020.

28:12.558 --> 28:14.493
Classes went online,
and I had this00 a.m.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.062
that I was so tired
of waking up for.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.298
And I was thinking, "I'm never,
ever talking in this class.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.666
I'm never being asked questions.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.735
Why don't I just send something
to attend for me?

28:22.769 --> 28:24.937
I'll go watch the recording
- on 2
- X speed later."

28:24.971 --> 28:26.705
And I'm actually giving myself
more productivity.

28:26.739 --> 28:27.974
So instead of, like --
I love it.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.008
Thank you. Thank you.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.877
So instead of being in this room

28:30.910 --> 28:32.078
sitting through
this miserable meeting,

28:32.111 --> 28:33.579
waiting for this lecture to end,

28:33.612 --> 28:35.882
I can, like,
be in two places at once.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.884
Go out for a walk in the sun
when I wake up

28:37.917 --> 28:39.418
and then come back
and watch my lecture,

28:39.451 --> 28:41.553
do my homework later,
be more productive.
Oh, I love it.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.522
Peter, how many people
have used the product?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.958
92,000 the last time I checked.
Yeah.

28:45.992 --> 28:48.527
And I've spent -- I spent
a total of $300 on marketing.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.996
It's just viral
word-of-mouth growth.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.697
Do you charge for it
at all?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.900
So, right now,
the way I think about it

28:53.933 --> 28:55.501
is sales should not
be the goal.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.736
Growth should be the goal.

28:57.770 --> 29:01.707
This is an Internet-scalable
venture-backable moon-shot idea.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.076
But we do have sales.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.311
The only reason
we have sales

29:05.344 --> 29:07.313
is because after
dropping out of school,

29:07.346 --> 29:10.682
I completely ran out of money
when I was building it,

29:10.716 --> 29:13.152
maxed out all my credit cards,
had to move in with my mom.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.287
Maybe you should have attended
more of the classes.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.123
Yeah, right.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.190
It's a good backup plan.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.558
So, how did you get sales?

29:19.591 --> 29:21.060
So then,
when that happened,

29:21.093 --> 29:23.963
I started charging new users
around $6.99 a month.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.132
We make right now
about $1,000 a month.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.600
Why not just charge a one-time
fee of like 5 bucks?

29:28.634 --> 29:30.202
That's a good point.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.939
I do like that idea, though.
I think that's --

29:32.972 --> 29:34.673
It didn't -- It didn't
cross your mind at all?

29:34.706 --> 29:37.476
Well, no, I mean --

29:37.509 --> 29:38.744
You dropped out
of school?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.279
Dropped out of school.
Why?

29:40.312 --> 29:41.347
While I was working
on it part-time

29:41.380 --> 29:42.748
while I was in school,

29:42.781 --> 29:44.884
I was learning 10 times more
by building a product

29:44.917 --> 29:47.219
and actually being
a business person.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.755
The question is
what skill set do you have

29:49.788 --> 29:52.892
that allows you
to take this vision further?

29:52.925 --> 29:54.994
GPT-3 if you're talking
about using A.I.
Right.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.695
What do you know
about those areas?

29:56.728 --> 29:58.264
I mean,
I'm not an A.I. expert

29:58.297 --> 29:59.498
by any stretch of
the imagination,

29:59.531 --> 30:01.600
but I have,
as a computer science major,

30:01.633 --> 30:04.937
a pretty decent understanding
of how to connect these systems.

30:04.971 --> 30:06.873
You must have tried
to raise money at Goldman.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.207
Eh.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.675
Did you take it
to any other people?

30:09.708 --> 30:11.510
We haven't taken any investment,
any outside investment.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.479
Have you pitched this
to any other investor?

30:13.512 --> 30:15.147
I-I have pitched it
to like two.

30:15.181 --> 30:18.017
It was very kind of
informal conversations with VCs,

30:18.050 --> 30:19.618
just, like, getting feedback

30:19.651 --> 30:22.154
on the idea
and seeing where it goes.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.924
So I could see it being useful
for some people,

30:24.957 --> 30:27.093
students like you,
et cetera.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.495
But the integrity issue
bothers me,

30:29.528 --> 30:31.330
and I do think
it could get people in trouble

30:31.363 --> 30:32.932
as equally as it could
help them.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.466
It's not
a business for me.
Sure.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.535
So I'm sorry.
I'm out.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.870
I really appreciate your time,
though.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.271
Thank you.

30:39.305 --> 30:42.541
Peter,
I-I just love it as an idea.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.110
But you know,
to Lori's issues,

30:44.143 --> 30:46.745
there may be
some compliance issues

30:46.778 --> 30:48.948
that may be brought forward
because attendance is sometimes

30:48.981 --> 30:52.518
legally required
in some of the worlds I live in.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.988
And so that's my concern,
but I wish you the best.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.856
I can't be an investor.
I'm out.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.658
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.460
I-I think
it's a hilarious pitch.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.930
You created a new form
of hooky,

31:03.963 --> 31:06.798
playing hooky, right?

31:06.832 --> 31:08.600
Has the potential to be
a lot more, too.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.603
But, you know,
maybe I'm oversensitive to it.

31:11.637 --> 31:12.939
I think communication
is the only thing

31:12.972 --> 31:14.573
that separates us
from the animals,

31:14.606 --> 31:19.745
and to feel like somebody
opted out of communicating,

31:19.778 --> 31:21.413
I don't feel comfortable
with it.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.082
I'm out.
Thank you.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.184
I would love to
just address kind of the --
Peter.

31:25.217 --> 31:28.988
The idea as a business
doesn't exist.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.557
There's -- There's
no business here.

31:31.590 --> 31:32.858
This is not a business.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.760
You will not run this
as a business.

31:34.793 --> 31:37.329
You can't make revenue
off this business.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.765
It's a bad idea.
I'm out.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.300
I appreciate it.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.801
The app is great,

31:42.834 --> 31:46.738
but there's not a direct path
to monetization.

31:46.772 --> 31:49.075
The next iteration
of the product would be

31:49.108 --> 31:51.910
a simple drag-and-drop flow
of a decision builder

31:51.944 --> 31:53.946
where you -- you still
have prerecorded videos.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.882
But now, if you put
basic language processing

31:56.915 --> 31:58.517
on top of that,
or voice recognition --

31:58.550 --> 32:00.686
Do you realize how expensive
that is, though?

32:00.719 --> 32:02.288
I-I just don't see
the path, Peter.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.555
I would go back to school

32:03.589 --> 32:06.392
because if you really
want to win in this space,

32:06.425 --> 32:09.161
you got to know your A.I.
better than everybody else.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.496
That's fair. That's fair.
Right?

32:10.529 --> 32:12.764
Because you can't just depend
on hiring a team

32:12.798 --> 32:14.266
'cause it's expensive,
right?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.602
And it's changing
every single day.

32:16.635 --> 32:17.970
Otherwise, someone's just
gonna jump in front of you.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.905
Say it, Mark!
Say it!

32:19.938 --> 32:21.007
I'm out.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.608
Ahh. Alright.

32:22.641 --> 32:23.875
Well, it was a pleasure.
O'
Thank you, Peter.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.177
Thank you guys so much.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.578
Thanks, Peter.
Good luck.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.981
Good luck.
Thank you so much.
Take care.

32:30.349 --> 32:31.750
What I learned today,
if Mark Cuban wants me

32:31.783 --> 32:33.352
to finish college,
then maybe I should.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.787
I was thinking I'm probably
fine, but we'll see.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.289
I might go back to school.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.724
Mark, I just want you to know
something --

32:38.757 --> 32:40.592
during the back end of that
when you were grilling him,

32:40.626 --> 32:41.960
I actually wasn't here.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.531
I just came back.

32:55.807 --> 32:56.908
Next in the Tank

32:56.942 --> 32:58.744
is an inspirational
fashion brand

32:58.777 --> 33:01.113
from a teen with big dreams.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.757
I'm powerful.
I'm powerful.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.259
I'm strong.
I'm strong.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.760
I'm courageous.
I'm courageous.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.296
And we have an impact
that is changing the world.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.364
Let's get it.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.399
My name is Trey Brown,
and I'm a 15-year-old

33:20.432 --> 33:21.933
full-time entrepreneur,

33:21.967 --> 33:23.202
but I've had
a millionaire mind-set

33:23.235 --> 33:24.903
since I was 12 years old.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.473
Today, I'm seeking
a $300,000 investment

33:27.506 --> 33:30.609
for a 10% stake
in my business, SPERGO.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.678
SPERGO is a designer
lifestyle apparel brand

33:32.711 --> 33:34.813
that combines fashion
and comfort

33:34.846 --> 33:36.815
for people who want to
live their dreams in style.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.384
On my 12th birthday,

33:38.417 --> 33:41.353
I invested $178
from my birthday money.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.790
I came up with the name, logo,
and bought 16 T-shirts

33:44.823 --> 33:46.492
that sold out instantly.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.894
This business allows me
to generate jobs for the youth,

33:48.927 --> 33:50.296
and I was able to
retire my mom,

33:50.329 --> 33:51.730
who is standing
next to me today

33:51.763 --> 33:54.066
as my first
full-time employee.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.202
Our luxury brand uses
bright and bold colors

33:56.235 --> 33:58.770
to motivate you
to dominate the day.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.140
So which Shark wants to jump on
this freight train

34:01.173 --> 34:03.175
by partnering
with a 15-year-old entrepreneur

34:03.209 --> 34:04.743
that's on his way
to being a billionaire

34:04.776 --> 34:06.412
by his 21st birthday?

34:06.445 --> 34:09.115
- Yeah! That's what's up!
- Get it.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.550
Check out the samples
that are in front of you guys.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.922
You know, today,
I've been feeling green.

34:16.955 --> 34:18.257
This has been
really amazing.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.359
Mavs blue, baby.
Mavs blue.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.094
Trey, why is it called SPERGO?

34:22.128 --> 34:23.529
I came up with
the name SPERGO

34:23.562 --> 34:25.997
combining the words "sports"
and "heroes,"

34:26.031 --> 34:27.333
and then I added G-O
at the end

34:27.366 --> 34:29.401
because SPERGO is
for the go-getters.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.069
It don't matter
what your profession is,

34:31.103 --> 34:33.372
as long as you're working hard
every day chasing your dreams,

34:33.405 --> 34:34.373
that's SPERGO.
You tell him, tiger.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.707
Wow.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.476
This is all embroidered, right?

34:37.509 --> 34:39.545
And a lot of people
try to cut corners

34:39.578 --> 34:40.746
by putting patches.

34:40.779 --> 34:41.680
And the quality's good.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.081
This is excellent.
Excellent.

34:43.115 --> 34:44.350
Thank you so much,
Mr. Daymond.
Thank you so much.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.552
What's the price
of some of these items?

34:46.585 --> 34:49.688
So, the Leo sweat suit,
the cost is $21.50.

34:49.721 --> 34:50.756
And what do you
sell it for?

34:50.789 --> 34:53.259
The Leos are sold
for $170.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.893
- $170.
- It's a premium brand.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.162
It is a premium brand.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.964
So you said that
you had T-shirts

34:58.997 --> 35:00.532
and they sold out in minutes.

35:00.566 --> 35:01.733
Tell us that story.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.270
So, I started off
with my birthday money,

35:04.303 --> 35:06.772
and I sold out the first week
to family and friends.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.774
The next week,
I went out to barbershops

35:08.807 --> 35:11.410
all around the city
of Philadelphia, where I'm from.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.811
And I wouldn't come into
the house

35:12.844 --> 35:14.413
unless everything
was sold.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.916
So I went from the 16 T-shirts,
you know, sold out that week,

35:17.949 --> 35:19.918
then it went
from 40 T-shirts to hoodies,

35:19.951 --> 35:21.553
and now we have
a global brand.

35:21.587 --> 35:25.123
He woke me up every Saturday
morning to go out and sell,

35:25.157 --> 35:26.725
and it was times
where he made a goal --

35:26.758 --> 35:28.294
He woke you up?
Yes.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.361
Yeah, Trey!

35:29.395 --> 35:30.929
Initially,
he started off with like,

35:30.962 --> 35:33.399
"Okay, our goal
is $300 today."

35:33.432 --> 35:34.900
Halfway through the day,
he will be like,

35:34.933 --> 35:36.535
"Mom, let's make it $500.

35:36.568 --> 35:37.803
Let's make it $600.
Let's make it $700."

35:37.836 --> 35:39.271
- Yeah, Trey!
- Good for you.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.906
And then when he would
get the money,

35:40.939 --> 35:42.608
I was like,
"Trey, what do you want to buy?"

35:42.641 --> 35:43.809
And he was like, "Mom,
I don't want to buy anything.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.544
I want to go ahead
and get more T-shirts."

35:45.577 --> 35:47.613
He would constantly
invest money.
Yeah!

35:47.646 --> 35:52.284
What is driving people
to buy from you like that?

35:52.318 --> 35:53.585
SPERGO is more
than clothing.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.086
SPERGO is a feeling.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.723
A lot of times when people
may buy SPERGO, you know,

35:57.756 --> 36:00.091
they'll tag me on Instagram
and different things like that.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.360
Like, I'm inspiring youth

36:01.393 --> 36:02.728
not just in the city
of Philadelphia,

36:02.761 --> 36:04.196
but all over the world

36:04.230 --> 36:05.931
that you could chase your dreams
at a young age.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.400
Trey, do you have a lot of
followers on social media?

36:08.434 --> 36:11.803
Yes, I have over 89,000
followers on Instagram.

36:11.837 --> 36:12.938
- Wow.
- Nice.

36:12.971 --> 36:14.005
And our
SPERGO Billionaire page

36:14.039 --> 36:16.308
has over 71,000 followers.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.278
Wow. Listen, that's amazing.
You're 15 years old.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.314
What led you to decide
to create a clothing line?

36:22.348 --> 36:26.352
Growing up in the city
of Philadelphia was really hard.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.321
You know, violence
and drug-infested.

36:29.355 --> 36:32.190
And I didn't really see
a lot of positive things.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.560
And there's a lot of kids
just like me,

36:34.593 --> 36:37.463
and I wanted to be the light
and role model for, you know,

36:37.496 --> 36:39.064
not just youth
in the city of Philadelphia,

36:39.097 --> 36:41.800
but all over, you know,
to show them that it's possible

36:41.833 --> 36:43.935
that you could chase your dreams
and you don't have to be violent

36:43.969 --> 36:46.538
or you don't have to get
into drugs to make money.

36:46.572 --> 36:49.275
And my mom,
she was a seamstress.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.378
Also growing up in a household
where church is every Sunday,

36:52.411 --> 36:54.380
you know, we getting dressed up
every day,

36:54.413 --> 36:56.282
suit, ties every Sunday.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.716
You know,
so clothing was really, like,

36:57.749 --> 36:59.217
an essential thing
in my household.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.287
- Gotcha.
- Trey, I love that story.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.290
What are the total sales
today?

37:04.323 --> 37:08.594
To this day, our total sales
are $1.8 million.

37:08.627 --> 37:09.795
- Wow!
- Whoa!

37:09.828 --> 37:11.797
- Hang on. Hang on.
- Wow.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.099
Did you say $1.8 million?

37:14.132 --> 37:15.467
- Yes.
- Yes.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.769
So $1.8 million
over what period of time?

37:17.803 --> 37:21.172
Yes, so 2018
was $40,000 in sales.

37:21.206 --> 37:24.376
2019 was $130,000
in sales.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.912
2020 was $745,000 in sales.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.113
- What?
- Wow.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.382
And I'm glad to say
that we already surpassed,

37:30.416 --> 37:32.584
you know, last year's sales
with, to this date,

37:32.618 --> 37:34.286
$938,000.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.954
- Wow.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.255
Oh, my gosh.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.757
So we right now,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.992
we are selling
in our e-commerce store.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.395
And we also have
pop-up shops, as well.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.497
We have three locations
right now.

37:45.531 --> 37:49.000
What percentage of the sales
are e-commerce, online?

37:49.034 --> 37:53.539
So 70% is POS and 30%
is e-commerce right now.

37:53.572 --> 37:56.675
You know, I'm blown away by --
he's 15 years old

37:56.708 --> 37:59.210
and he's talking like,
you know, he's 50.

37:59.244 --> 38:02.213
I want to know, where is
this traffic coming from?

38:02.247 --> 38:04.916
So, in 2018,
I was moving around the city,

38:04.950 --> 38:06.084
like,
doing the barbershops,

38:06.117 --> 38:07.553
and I ran into someone.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.087
And he was
super inspired by me.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.656
He gave me
Mr. Sean "Diddy" Combs'

38:10.689 --> 38:13.525
phone number, you know,
and I found out

38:13.559 --> 38:16.695
that Mr. Sean "Diddy" Combs
posted me on Instagram.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.998
It has, like, about 500,000
views to this day.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.300
Wow.
We got our first-ever
wholesale order,

38:22.334 --> 38:23.802
and this was in our first year
of business.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.504
Like, our website
blowing up,

38:25.537 --> 38:27.606
I had so many followers,

38:27.639 --> 38:30.342
my first-ever time I had
five figures in my bank account.

38:30.376 --> 38:32.277
You know,
and I used that --
Yeah.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.179
And I used that to get
my first sweat suits.

38:34.212 --> 38:36.948
Trey was able to get celebrities
to wear his brand.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.817
And then last year,

38:38.850 --> 38:41.119
we met Sean "Diddy" Combs
for the first time,

38:41.152 --> 38:44.289
and Sean gave Trey
a $25,000 grant,

38:44.322 --> 38:46.858
which allowed us to open
a physical store.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.495
What do you think you'll do
this year, total?

38:49.528 --> 38:52.898
This year, we are planning
to do $2.2 million.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.199
- Whoa.
- Wow.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.067
How much money have you made
so far year to date?

38:56.101 --> 38:59.070
Our profits is $313,000.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.806
Before you pay yourself,
right?

39:00.839 --> 39:02.474
No, that's after
we paid ourselves.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.275
- Nice.
- Whoa.
- Wow.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.545
Trey, obviously,
I relate to this

39:06.578 --> 39:08.313
because I started
a clothing brand,

39:08.346 --> 39:12.384
and my mother was and is
a huge inspiration in my life.

39:12.418 --> 39:13.985
What do you want to do
with the money?

39:14.019 --> 39:16.287
So far, it's just
Trey and I.

39:16.321 --> 39:17.589
We want to hire
a fashion designer.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.591
We want to hire someone
that can help us

39:19.625 --> 39:21.660
with those digital sales
and e-commerce

39:21.693 --> 39:24.596
and get our website
on a faster speed.

39:24.630 --> 39:26.732
We're trying to get
the resources we need

39:26.765 --> 39:28.700
to sustain our growth.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.069
You're gonna do
$2.2 million this year

39:31.102 --> 39:32.571
at 15 years old, right?

39:32.604 --> 39:34.339
I mean, I'm just
trying to understand

39:34.372 --> 39:38.577
what you think you need more
when you're doing amazing.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.979
Right now, we're producing
for the current season.

39:41.012 --> 39:43.181
We should be two seasons
ahead of time.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.685
I feel like we are in position
to blow this company up,

39:46.718 --> 39:47.919
but we are --

39:47.953 --> 39:50.589
- You are already blowing up.
- Yeah.

39:50.622 --> 39:52.791
I'm not sure if you really
are ready for a partner.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.762
So impressive,
both of you.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.097
I personally think that

39:59.130 --> 40:01.800
I'm not the best partner here
for you.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.002
So solely for that reason,

40:04.035 --> 40:06.204
I'm going to take myself out.

40:07.372 --> 40:10.108
Thank you so much, Ms. Lori.
Thank you so much, Ms. Lori.

40:10.141 --> 40:12.544
Guys, it's just amazing
and incredible.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.979
15 years old,

40:14.012 --> 40:15.481
sales of over a million bucks,

40:15.514 --> 40:17.883
but I'm not a clothing guy.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.485
This is not my space.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.186
I'm out.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.420
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

40:22.454 --> 40:24.590
Trey, every clothing business
I've invested in

40:24.623 --> 40:26.157
were all online.

40:26.191 --> 40:29.327
You're 70% brick and mortar.

40:29.360 --> 40:32.564
And so as I think of
how do I scale that,

40:32.598 --> 40:34.299
that scares me.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.901
Right.
I'm out.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.904
Thanks so much, Mr. Robert.
Thanks so much.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.573
The vision is great,

40:41.607 --> 40:45.310
but you have to walk
to the vision, not run

40:45.343 --> 40:47.112
because you want to see
what's right in front of you

40:47.145 --> 40:48.780
and all around you.
Okay.

40:48.814 --> 40:52.784
No blowing up to be this huge,
$100 million brand this year.

40:52.818 --> 40:53.819
Right.
Okay.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.320
Right?
It might take three years.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.455
It might take 20 years.

40:57.489 --> 41:00.158
But at least
you'll have a progression.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.960
I don't do clothes, right?

41:04.596 --> 41:08.299
But I do help young superstars,

41:08.333 --> 41:11.169
and I do want to
enable people with dreams

41:11.202 --> 41:12.871
to go accomplish things

41:12.904 --> 41:15.774
that some other people
might not think is possible.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.945
And so I'll offer you
the $300,000.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.013
I want 25% of the company.

41:24.850 --> 41:25.984
Thanks so much,
Mr. Mark.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.119
Thank you, Mr. Mark.
Thank you.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.321
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

41:30.355 --> 41:33.358
Do you want to
come in with me?

41:33.391 --> 41:35.460
No.
I don't need him for that.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.829
it's like him needing me
for something in sports.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.534
I'll match that.

41:42.568 --> 41:43.935
There you go.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.737
O'Whoa, two offers.

41:45.771 --> 41:48.073
Boom.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.475
Mr. Daymond, would you do
$300,000 for 20%?

41:56.782 --> 41:58.216
Absolutely.

41:58.249 --> 41:59.551
Yes!
Yes. Let's do it.

41:59.585 --> 42:02.120
- Congratulations.
- Yay!

42:02.153 --> 42:04.155
You had to. I wanted you to
say that. You had to.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.490
Thank you so much,
Mr. Daymond.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.658
Thank you so much.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.660
Thank you so much.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.896
Wow. Thank you so much,
Mr. Daymond.
Yes!

42:10.929 --> 42:12.530
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

42:12.564 --> 42:14.566
- Good job, guys.
- Great job, guys.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.701
Congrats, guys.

42:15.734 --> 42:16.935
Yes!

42:16.968 --> 42:18.403
Let's get it.

42:18.436 --> 42:20.171
I used to bring
Mr. Daymond's book to school

42:20.205 --> 42:21.773
and I would read it,
you know,

42:21.807 --> 42:23.474
any time
I would finish my work.

42:23.508 --> 42:26.277
You know, so now to be
partnering with Mr. Daymond,

42:26.311 --> 42:27.746
it's still soaking in
right now.

42:27.779 --> 42:28.747
I know.
It feels great.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.782
It's so surreal.
