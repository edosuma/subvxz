(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.436 --> 00:06.074
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.676
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.709 --> 00:10.611
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.644 --> 00:12.213
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.246 --> 00:14.082
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.716
These are their stories.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.818
[phone rings]

00:17.851 --> 00:19.520
(woman)
Police operator 3529.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.089
Where is your emergency?

00:21.122 --> 00:22.090
[child on phone]
Hello?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.658
Where you calling from?

00:24.692 --> 00:26.294
Hello?

00:26.327 --> 00:27.595
Are you in Harlem?

00:27.628 --> 00:29.363
[with Latin accent]
I'm in a room.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.100
What's wrong, sweetheart?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.234
I can't get out.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.235
I'm hungry.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.669
[whispers]
Ronda, Ronda!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.171
I need help.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.606
Please can you help me?

00:38.639 --> 00:40.674
Can you tell me
where you are?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.343
I don't know
where I am.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.248
Olivia!

00:47.281 --> 00:49.417
Olivia!

00:49.450 --> 00:50.851
I need you.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.753
[sighs]

00:52.786 --> 00:54.222
One second.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.158
911 got a call
from a nine-year-old girl.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.392
Says she's locked
in a room.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.393
Is she hurt?

00:59.427 --> 01:00.728
We don't know.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.496
Parents probably didn't want
to pay for a babysitter.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.465
Just keep her talking
till we can track her down.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.699
Line two.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.202
All right, everybody,
let's keep it quiet.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.838
This is Detective Benson.
Put her through.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.806
(child)
Hello?

01:12.840 --> 01:15.509
Hi. My name's Olivia.
What's your name?

01:15.543 --> 01:16.510
Maria.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.745
Hi, Maria.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.747
You and me are gonna talk

01:19.780 --> 01:21.682
until my friends come
and get you, okay?

01:21.715 --> 01:22.716
Tell them to come quick.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.385
Are you hurt, Maria?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.720
I'm hungry.
My stomach hurts.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.356
Well, when's
the last time you ate?

01:28.389 --> 01:29.823
Two days ago.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.229
Well, you must be starving.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.664
What about drink?

01:36.697 --> 01:39.200
I finished
a water yesterday.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.868
Please, will you help me?

01:40.901 --> 01:44.405
We will, sweetheart.
We're gonna be there soon.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.759
(Cragen)
It's an old phone
with no GPS.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.795
Registered to a cabbie,
Ricardo Garcia.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.697
He took an assault collar
for whaling on his wife.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.233
Where'd the 911 call
come from?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.200
Spanish Harlem.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.802
Probably the housing project
on 115th and 3rd.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.704
There's gotta be thousands
of apartments there.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.640
That's as close
as the trace gets us.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.674
The girl doesn't know
her own address?

02:53.707 --> 02:56.210
No. Probably 'cause she hasn't
eaten for two days.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.411
Liv is talking to her now.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.480
TARU moved her
into the interview room

02:59.513 --> 03:00.414
where it's quiet.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.416
Now, we gotta throw
everything at this.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.385
Elliot's on a case
in Brooklyn.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.953
Munch is running the
door-to-door in the projects.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.988
And I need you
to find Ricardo Garcia.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.557
The super said
he moved last month,

03:09.590 --> 03:11.559
didn't leave an address.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.826
Maria give us anything?

03:12.860 --> 03:13.994
She won't say her last name

03:14.027 --> 03:15.529
or tell us
where her parents are.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.864
Why not?
She seems scared.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.699
Olivia's still trying
to get her address.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.234
(Olivia on speaker)
Maria, now, are you

03:20.268 --> 03:22.236
in a house or an apartment?

03:22.270 --> 03:23.371
(Maria)
I don't know.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.906
Okay, how many rooms
do you live in?

03:25.939 --> 03:27.675
I live in one room.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.577
But I got
so hungry and thirsty,

03:29.610 --> 03:31.245
I broke the lock,
and I went

03:31.279 --> 03:32.246
in the other room.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.681
There was a bottle of water.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.915
I drank it.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.617
Is the door always locked?

03:36.650 --> 03:39.620
When I'm alone.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.956
Maria, did your parents
lock you in this room?

03:42.990 --> 03:44.692
No.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.927
I don't know.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.862
Can you go outside?

03:48.896 --> 03:52.900
That door doesn't open.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.903
Okay, can you see
anything out the window?

03:55.936 --> 03:58.672
Like tall buildings,
a bridge, a river,

03:58.706 --> 03:59.873
anything like that?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.809
There aren't any windows.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.878
Just a bed and a picture
on the wall.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.580
What kind of picture?

04:06.614 --> 04:07.981
A garden.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.883
Maria, how did you get
the phone?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.619
I--

04:11.652 --> 04:12.820
I found it.
Where?

04:12.853 --> 04:14.688
In his jacket.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.490
Whose jacket?

04:16.524 --> 04:18.926
Richard's jacket.
It was on the door.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.861
The phone was in the pocket.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.530
I didn't steal it.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.865
Maria, who's Richard?

04:24.898 --> 04:26.600
M-My dad.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.536
And what's his last name?

04:28.569 --> 04:29.670
I don't know.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.838
You don't know?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.906
Doesn't he have the same
last name as you?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.845
What about your mom?
What's her name?

04:37.878 --> 04:41.849
Beatrice.
Beatrice Recinos.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.352
And is she with Richard now?

04:44.385 --> 04:45.453
No.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.787
Where is she?

04:46.820 --> 04:47.955
[crying]
She's nowhere.

04:47.988 --> 04:48.956
She died.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.324
I'm sorry, Maria.

04:50.358 --> 04:53.827
Run Maria Recinos
through Missing Persons.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.962
We're on it.

04:54.995 --> 04:58.499
Cell phone is registered
to cab driver Ricardo Garcia.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.900
Ricardo?

04:59.933 --> 05:01.469
Richard.
That's the same name.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.470
Sounds like it.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.971
Fin called,
managed to track him

05:04.004 --> 05:05.473
through the cab company.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.874
[tires screech]

05:06.907 --> 05:08.041
[horn honks]
Hey!

05:08.075 --> 05:09.977
Ricardo Garcia.

05:10.010 --> 05:10.611
What did I do?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.979
You got a cell phone?
Why?

05:14.615 --> 05:15.949
Take it easy.
I lost it.

05:15.983 --> 05:16.784
Where?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.018
If I knew that,
it wouldn't be lost.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.487
You got a daughter?
Yeah, why?

05:19.520 --> 05:20.488
How old is she?

05:20.521 --> 05:21.722
About nine,
I don't know.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.023
What do you mean
you don't know?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.493
I've never seen her, 'cause her
loving mama stole her from me.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.494
Where's her mother live?

05:26.527 --> 05:27.495
Spanish Harlem.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.896
Come on,
you're taking me there.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.731
Where are you from, Maria?

05:30.764 --> 05:32.966
I'm from here.
America.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.736
Your English is very good.
Where did you learn it?

05:35.769 --> 05:39.006
My mother taught me.
She was a teacher.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.409
Did she teach you at home
or at school?

05:41.442 --> 05:42.710
(Maria)
At home.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.778
(Benson)
But where do you
go to school?

05:44.812 --> 05:48.649
My dad says
I don't need to.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.752
Don't you ever go
to stores or to the park?

05:51.785 --> 05:53.587
Do you ever go
to movies?

05:53.621 --> 05:55.756
I don't go out.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.726
You have to go out sometimes.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.529
I stay in my room.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.830
[knock at door]

06:02.863 --> 06:05.032
Police, where's
your daughter?

06:05.065 --> 06:05.966
Why?

06:05.999 --> 06:07.735
What lies has this loser
been telling you?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.403
You can't just
walk in here.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.072
[speaking Spanish]

06:12.105 --> 06:13.874
(Garcia)
He's got a bug
up his ass.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.009
My mom says
I have to stay in.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.077
Hello, Liv?

06:17.110 --> 06:19.980
Hold on, hold on,
who is this?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.482
What's your name?

06:21.515 --> 06:22.916
Angela.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.885
[sighs]
All right,
sorry to bother you.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.054
Are you all right,
baby?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.756
Captain, this is Fin.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.559
It's not Garcia.
His child's safe.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.593
(Cragen)
Okay.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.761
Come on back.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.929
Now, how the hell did Maria

06:35.963 --> 06:37.565
end up
with Garcia's phone?

06:37.598 --> 06:38.699
Her dad could've stolen it.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.967
He could even
have cloned the number.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.502
I thought that went out
in the '90s.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.003
It's back.
All you need is a DDI.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.538
Well, speak English,
for God's sake.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.539
Digital Data Interceptor.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.808
Scan the airwaves,
steal any number you want.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.444
So we can't even trace this guy
through his phone bills.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.546
We can, but it'd take days.

06:52.580 --> 06:57.551
She's already been on
50 minutes.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.552
John.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.620
Munch.

06:59.653 --> 07:00.888
How's it going?
Oh, great.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.592
I got 60 men trying to search
2,000 apartments here, Captain.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.993
TARU's gonna have
to tighten the noose,

07:06.026 --> 07:07.828
or the girl's got
to give us more help.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.631
Tell me, Maria, is there
anything else in the room?

07:10.664 --> 07:14.067
Like papers, letters,
bills with an address on it?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.069
Nothing.
Just a big plastic bag.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.571
Well, did you look
inside it?

07:17.605 --> 07:19.172
It's got clothes.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.808
What kind of clothes.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.009
Girl's clothes.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.644
Are they yours?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.546
I have to wear
them sometimes...

07:25.579 --> 07:28.549
When I dress up.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.852
Maria, what about
your dad's jacket?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.253
Why don't you look inside
and tell me

07:33.286 --> 07:35.155
if there's anything else
in the pockets, okay?

07:35.188 --> 07:36.690
Okay.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.658
[mute button beeps]

07:37.691 --> 07:39.660
Missing Persons drew a blank
on Maria Recinos.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.728
Are you getting anything?

07:40.761 --> 07:42.229
Not a lot.
She's still afraid.

07:42.262 --> 07:45.866
Is there any chance
she's making this up?

07:45.899 --> 07:47.701
Some of the things
don't make sense.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.237
I think she's for real.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.175
I've got a dialect expert coming
in to track her accent.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.276
Maybe that'll help.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.745
Olivia.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.180
I found a piece of paper
all squashed up.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.550
Good job, sweetheart,
what does it say?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.718
Felipe's Burgers.

08:04.752 --> 08:09.523
342 94th Street
and then lots of numbers.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.958
Do you know the place?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.292
Uh...

08:12.325 --> 08:14.562
Maria, listen to me,
this is very important.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.864
Do you know
Felipe's Burgers?

08:16.897 --> 08:17.865
Yes.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.199
Are you sure?

08:19.232 --> 08:21.201
It's where Richard
buys my food.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.971
94th Street is nearly 20 blocks
out of the search area.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.038
But if this Richard buys

08:25.072 --> 08:29.276
her food there all the time,
they probably know him.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.645
Good job, Maria,
very good job.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.751
(officer)
This is it.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.687
342 94th Street.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.954
(Fin)
What do you mean?

08:40.988 --> 08:43.023
There's nothing here.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.106
Ma'am.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.240
You know
where Felipe's Burgers is?

09:00.273 --> 09:01.241
You're looking at it.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.042
What happened?

09:02.075 --> 09:04.578
They had a fire--
three months ago.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.246
Sold it,
tore down what was left.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.247
Thank you.

09:07.280 --> 09:11.151
No loss.
Burgers were lousy.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.953
Captain, this place is gone.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.022
It burnt down
three months ago.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.157
(Maria)
Sometimes he gives me hot dogs.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.693
But not with mustard,
only ketchup.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.161
I like french fries best.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.996
Maria, when is the last time

09:23.030 --> 09:25.132
Richard brought you food
from Felipe's?

09:25.165 --> 09:28.936
I-I don't know.
Two days ago?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.672
Felipe's burned down
three months ago, Maria.

09:31.705 --> 09:34.007
How is that possible?

09:34.041 --> 09:35.909
I don't know.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.711
[sighs]

09:37.745 --> 09:39.146
[mute button beeps]

09:39.179 --> 09:42.149
We've got more than 100 officers
out there chasing shadows.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.051
You have got to push her.

09:47.955 --> 09:48.922
[mute button beeps]

09:48.956 --> 09:50.758
Maria...

09:50.791 --> 09:53.360
I can't help you
if you're lying to me.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.696
He said this would happen.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.964
Said what would happen?

09:56.997 --> 10:00.200
He said if I told the police,
they wouldn't believe me.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.703
Told them what?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.204
Maria?

10:04.237 --> 10:06.139
[phone clicks and dial tone]

10:06.173 --> 10:07.174
She hung up.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.208
Call her again.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.309
(Morales)
I'm on it.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.078
[phone rings]

10:11.111 --> 10:12.680
[recorded voice]
We're sorry.
The number you have--

10:12.713 --> 10:13.781
Try her again.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.148
Even if the phone
is out of service,

10:15.182 --> 10:16.349
she could still make
911 calls.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.919
[phone rings]

10:18.952 --> 10:21.855
We're sorry.
The number you have reached--

10:21.889 --> 10:23.423
[phone dialing and ringing]

10:23.456 --> 10:25.893
[ringing]

10:25.926 --> 10:27.294
We're sorry.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.863
The number you have reached
is no longer in service.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.801
I lost her.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.007
(Cragen)
We've alerted the call center.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.009
They'll put her through
if she phones again.

10:42.042 --> 10:46.313
She won't.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.148
I was too tough on her.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.950
She calls here
asking for help,

10:49.983 --> 10:52.385
and I accuse her of lying.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.824
We had to find out.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.793
You know, there might be
another explanation.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.194
Oh, what do you mean?

11:01.228 --> 11:05.165
You remember Jessica,
September '04?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.234
She calls 911.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.902
Says she's four years old

11:08.936 --> 11:11.171
and that her mommy
has stopped breathing.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.807
She gave the cops
a home address, a school,

11:13.841 --> 11:16.043
even a teacher's name
before she hung up.

11:16.076 --> 11:19.046
They searched, never found
a single one of 'em.

11:19.079 --> 11:23.116
Dozens of cops tied up.
Thousands of hours wasted.

11:23.150 --> 11:26.854
It was all a hoax
by an 18-year-old girl.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.056
(Morales)
Captain!

11:29.089 --> 11:31.091
I've got something.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.393
I've enhanced the background.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.729
Listen--

11:35.763 --> 11:36.964
[recording of Maria]
Felipe's Burgers.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.231
[horns honking]

11:38.265 --> 11:40.500
342 94th Street
and then lots of numbers.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.501
[electronic beep]

11:41.534 --> 11:42.402
Well, sounds like traffic,

11:42.435 --> 11:44.037
but with something else
underneath like...

11:44.071 --> 11:45.038
some kind of hum.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.039
Play it again.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.008
I'll try
and EQ the voice out.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.910
[low hum]

11:49.943 --> 11:51.511
It's an engine,
a car or truck.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.413
She's moving?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.115
She said she was locked
in a room.

11:55.148 --> 11:55.983
(Morales)
She could be
in a tractor trailer

11:56.016 --> 11:58.185
or in a cargo container
on a flatbed.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.820
But the phone signal
wasn't moving.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.154
Well, maybe
she's parked somewhere

12:01.188 --> 12:03.123
or just moving within
the search area.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.192
(Novak)
Captain--

12:05.225 --> 12:07.828
This is Julia Ortiz,
dialect expert.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.262
I worked with her in court.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.198
Donald Cragen,
Olivia Benson.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.399
Hey.
Tell us what you need.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.871
[phone rings]

12:17.905 --> 12:20.007
Ronda, I think it's her.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.341
It's the same number.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.276
Hello?
Is this Maria?

12:23.310 --> 12:26.113
(Maria)
Yes, can I talk
to a lady called Olivia?

12:26.146 --> 12:27.280
(Ronda)
Sure, honey.

12:27.314 --> 12:28.281
I'll put you right
through to her.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.549
(Munch)
Holland Tunnel?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.418
She's leaving Manhattan.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.553
(Cragen)
Liv, Maria called 911 again.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.955
They're putting her through.

12:34.988 --> 12:35.989
Now, the call location
has changed

12:36.023 --> 12:39.026
to near the Holland Tunnel,
so she must've moved.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.294
I'm stopping the search in
Harlem and sending Fin downtown.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.797
Any luck?

12:43.831 --> 12:45.465
I think she's
from Central America.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.267
El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Honduras.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.836
I hear more,
I can narrow it down.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.303
(Morales)
Olivia, it's her.

12:50.337 --> 12:54.341
Maria, it's Olivia.
I'm so glad you called back.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.843
(Maria)
I wasn't lying to you.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.310
You didn't have
to get angry.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.812
I wasn't angry with you,
sweetheart.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.380
Yes, you were.
Your voice was angry.

13:00.413 --> 13:03.216
No, honey, I was just worried.
Now, listen to me.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.352
Maria, we are tracking
your phone call

13:05.385 --> 13:06.987
because that's how
we're gonna find you.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.822
And I can see here
that you've moved.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.925
No, I'm still here.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.127
Well, then
is the room moving?

13:14.161 --> 13:17.230
Rooms can't move.
Why are you teasing me?

13:17.264 --> 13:19.900
I'm not, I'm just trying
to work things out.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.168
Maria, hold on, okay?

13:21.201 --> 13:22.335
Okay.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.838
What are we gonna believe?
The technology or the girl?

13:28.876 --> 13:30.210
Maria...

13:30.243 --> 13:32.145
can you hear any noises?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.346
I don't know.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.216
I think I can hear cars.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.519
I'll see where Fin is.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.620
[siren wails]

13:40.653 --> 13:41.621
(Cragen)
Fin, it's Cragen.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.156
What's your location?

13:43.190 --> 13:44.992
Approaching the tunnel.
Traffic's already backed up.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.027
What do you want me
to do, Captain?

13:50.630 --> 13:53.366
I'll get onto Port Authority PD.
We shut down the tunnel.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.436
Search every van, every truck
leaving Manhattan.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.038
Tunnel's gonna be shut down
for hours.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.639
Yup.
I'll get back to ya.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.174
(Olivia)
Maria,

14:01.208 --> 14:02.375
were you born in New York?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.044
(Maria)
Yes.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.612
[whispers]
No? Okay.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.414
Maria, my friend Julia's here,

14:07.447 --> 14:09.482
and she can tell exactly
where people are from

14:09.516 --> 14:11.051
just by listening
to them talk.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.652
No!
I can't talk anymore.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.653
I'll get in trouble.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.122
Why will you get
in trouble?

14:15.155 --> 14:17.290
Richard will be angry.
He'll do things.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.459
A mi me da mincho.
I have to go.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.028
No, no, Maria.
Please don't go.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.095
It's okay, honey,
please don't go.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.097
[whispers]
"Me da mincho"
means "I'm scared."

14:24.131 --> 14:25.598
It's Honduran slang.

14:25.632 --> 14:29.136
Honey, you're not gonna get
into any trouble.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.372
Are you from Honduras?

14:32.405 --> 14:34.942
Will you get here
before he does?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.443
I will.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.444
Yes.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.646
Where in Honduras?

14:39.679 --> 14:42.249
Tegus.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.051
It's what the locals call
Tegucigalpa.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.352
It's the capital.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.321
And where in Tegus
are you from?

14:48.355 --> 14:51.158
1253 Calle Federal,
apartment 3.

14:51.191 --> 14:56.063
We're gonna need to talk
to the Honduran Consul.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.531
Maria, who brought you
to America?

14:58.565 --> 15:04.371
[speaking Spanish]

15:04.404 --> 15:05.572
He's tied up.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.074
There's some sort
of reception going on

15:07.107 --> 15:08.075
at the consulate.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.409
What do you want
the Consul to do?

15:09.442 --> 15:11.011
Put us in touch
with the Honduran police.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.545
I'll go see him in person.

15:12.579 --> 15:13.546
You know him?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.614
Not yet.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.483
We came across the desert

15:16.516 --> 15:17.484
and through the big fence.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.954
A man was waiting.
He took me to New York.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.090
And this was
after your mom died?

15:23.123 --> 15:25.725
No.
She was still alive.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.694
Your mom sent you away?

15:27.727 --> 15:31.431
To be with my dad
in America.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.400
You mean Richard.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.502
I-I don't know.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.404
Please, when are you
coming to get me?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.372
Soon, Maria.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.509
You have to be brave.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.978
Did your mom send you
to Richard?

15:45.012 --> 15:46.079
[crying]

15:46.113 --> 15:47.981
He made me promise
not to tell.

15:48.015 --> 15:51.151
Maria, listen to me.
Richard isn't gonna hurt you.

15:51.184 --> 15:55.488
Did your mom send you to him?

15:55.522 --> 15:57.257
No.

15:57.290 --> 16:01.161
She sent me to my old dad.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.295
Sweetheart,
I don't understand.

16:02.329 --> 16:05.098
I thought Richard
is your dad.

16:05.132 --> 16:08.235
He's my new dad.

16:08.268 --> 16:11.204
My mom and dad sold me
for much money,

16:11.238 --> 16:14.074
so I belong to Richard now.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.476
And I have to do
what he wants.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.588
[crying]

16:28.621 --> 16:31.424
What does he do, Maria?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.426
[crying]

16:33.460 --> 16:38.331
I don't want
to talk about it.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.101
Does he do bad things to you?

16:45.372 --> 16:51.211
He hurts me a lot.

16:51.244 --> 16:55.048
And then his friends hurt me

16:55.082 --> 16:57.584
so that he can take
his pictures.

17:06.459 --> 17:10.497
(Fin)
Port Authority PD's already
got roadblocks in place.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.065
We want all trucks,

17:12.099 --> 17:14.534
big rigs, panel trucks,
tractor trailers, whatever.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.770
Pull 'em onto Watts,
no exceptions.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.372
(Fin)
What do we got?

17:19.406 --> 17:23.543
Get it outta here.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.481
(Farias)
How can you be certain
she's from Honduras?

17:28.515 --> 17:30.283
A dialect expert identified
her accent,

17:30.317 --> 17:31.584
and the girl herself
confirmed it.

17:31.618 --> 17:32.419
It could be
a practical joke,

17:32.452 --> 17:33.553
or she's just trying
to get attention.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.723
Mr. Farias, this girl is
terrified, and she's starving.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.592
If we don't get to her soon,
then we'll find her dead body.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.261
Then guess who'll be getting
some attention?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.730
What do you want me
to do?

17:43.763 --> 17:45.798
Connect us with the police
in Tegucigalpa,

17:45.832 --> 17:46.833
the higher up the better.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.468
You can open doors for us.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.575
(Munch)
We got a problem, Captain.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.644
The second call came
in at 6:54.

17:57.677 --> 17:58.745
Now it's 7:29.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.647
If she's moving,
the tower position

18:00.680 --> 18:01.681
would've changed by now.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.383
She's probably stuck
in traffic,

18:03.416 --> 18:04.317
behind our roadblocks.

18:04.351 --> 18:05.618
Well, even with those,
she would've moved

18:05.652 --> 18:07.287
a couple blocks
in a half an hour.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.322
There's something else.
The phone signal.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.323
Normally calls triangulate

18:10.357 --> 18:11.391
off three
cell phone towers.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.325
But both times, this phone

18:12.359 --> 18:13.760
is only giving us
a reading off of two.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.528
I've asked
a communications expert

18:15.562 --> 18:16.596
from the FBI to come in--

18:16.629 --> 18:18.631
But what can we do now?

18:18.665 --> 18:19.899
Ask Maria to hang up
and call in again.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.634
We'll see what happens
to the signal.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.537
No.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.639
We can't risk
losing her again.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.808
Liv's been talking to her
for nearly two hours.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.543
We're still no closer
to finding her.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.513
What have we got
to lose?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.182
You want me to hang up?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.683
For two seconds,
that's all.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.286
And then dial 911
just like you did before.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.453
But why?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.522
Because, Maria,
it's gonna help us find you.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.557
Please, just do it for me.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.626
I knew you'd come back.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.795
Did it work?
Can you see where I am now?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.434
(Munch)
She's in Queens?

19:27.467 --> 19:28.768
From the Holland Tunnel
to Queens in two minutes?

19:28.801 --> 19:29.836
That's impossible.

19:29.869 --> 19:30.937
How do we explain it?

19:30.970 --> 19:33.540
We don't.
We're being played.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.245
Yes, we can see.

and get me?

don't you remember?

20:40.973 --> 20:42.842
What the hell are you doing?

20:42.875 --> 20:46.012
It's a voice changer.
Intelligence agencies use it.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.780
It allows you to alter your
voice however you want.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.283
What's your point?

20:50.317 --> 20:52.352
This whole thing could be
a sick joke.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.020
This sweet little girl

20:58.925 --> 20:59.992
Sorry, Maria,
I liked it.

21:00.026 --> 21:00.993
What's wrong?

21:01.027 --> 21:01.994
Nothing's wrong.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.696
Your voice is angry again.

Nobody would invent
the nightmare

21:13.105 --> 21:14.807
that she has been through.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.310
Why are you trying
to poke holes in her story

21:17.344 --> 21:18.978
rather than trying to find her?

21:19.011 --> 21:21.013
Because Munch found
some spook toy?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.383
Whoever's doing this
likes spook toys.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.451
He's already using
at least one device.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.519

21:35.628 --> 21:36.596
It's called Sound Cover.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.365
It enables

any smartass to pretend
he's somewhere that he's not,

21:39.866 --> 21:41.601

21:41.634 --> 21:43.069
So can't we track this guy
through the gadgets?

21:43.102 --> 21:44.236
I mean,
where does he buy them?

21:44.270 --> 21:46.906
Sound Cover is only available

lost her in the desert
when they were surprised

23:05.184 --> 23:06.553

in the desert,

Uh, yes, we think so.

24:10.249 --> 24:13.553

diverting the phone signal

24:13.586 --> 24:14.654
sending it
to different cell towers

Look, assume

24:19.926 --> 24:22.194

are in one place.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.930
The nearest cell towers

24:23.963 --> 24:25.832
should receive
the phone's signal.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.568
If you vector back
from the cell tower,

24:28.601 --> 24:30.537
you can get
an approximate location.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.004
But Maria's jumping
all over the map.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.240
She's in Harlem
and Holland Tunnel.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.575

24:35.608 --> 24:37.043
How could somebody
make this happen?

24:37.076 --> 24:39.211
Hack into the cell company's
switchboard

24:39.245 --> 24:40.647
and program a virus.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.282
So that whenever
this particular phone calls,

24:43.315 --> 24:45.652
the virus recognizes the number

24:45.685 --> 24:49.021
and diverts the signal
to random cell towers.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.156
And how do we fix this?

24:50.189 --> 24:51.157
The cell company

24:51.190 --> 24:54.026
has at least ten switchboards
in Manhattan.

24:54.060 --> 24:57.296
I scan each one for the virus
and download this.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.132
It'll spot
any anomalous programs,

25:00.166 --> 25:01.233
and we can remove them.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.535
How long?

[Maria singing Silent Night

26:57.817 --> 26:58.985
God knows
how long we have

26:59.018 --> 27:00.653
until her cell phone dies.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.054
What are you looking for?

27:02.088 --> 27:04.223
Photos of a girl.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.359
Montreal SVU has seen her
in dozens of porn shots,

27:07.393 --> 27:08.795
never able to identify.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.963
I got it.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.002
That's it.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.774
It's her.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.711
It's her, she said there was a
picture of a garden on the wall.

27:24.744 --> 27:25.712
Are you convinced?

27:25.745 --> 27:27.680
This man is one of the worst
child pornographers

27:27.714 --> 27:29.281
they've ever seen, and they
don't know a thing about him.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.050
That explains the bells
and whistles on the phone.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.251
He wants to make sure

27:32.284 --> 27:33.419
his kiddie porn business
doesn't get traced.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.787
Call Montreal, let 'em know.

something on the trace.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.694
We know how he's
rerouting the calls

27:41.728 --> 27:43.062
but not where
he's doing it from.

It says low battery.

27:44.463 --> 27:45.464
We'll be there soon, baby.

I promise.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.438
Sweetheart, can you describe

27:52.471 --> 27:55.742
the picture
on the wall for me?

27:55.775 --> 27:58.878
(Maria)
It's a garden
with flowers and trees.

27:58.911 --> 28:02.749
And there's a white fence.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.084
Is this where Richard takes
the pictures of you?

28:05.117 --> 28:08.721
It's where
he does everything.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.757
Tell me what
he looks like, Maria.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.491
What color are his eyes
and his hair?

28:12.524 --> 28:15.795
He has brown hair.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.897
I don't remember
his eyes.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.298
And is there anything special

28:19.331 --> 28:20.767
about him?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.434
Does he wear glasses
or have a moustache?

28:22.468 --> 28:23.502
Are there any scars?

28:23.535 --> 28:26.505
(Maria)
He has silver glasses.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.141
And when he does bad things,
he takes them off.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.242
And he folds them up,

28:30.276 --> 28:32.912
and he puts them
in a blue case.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.815
Olivia, my eyes are sleepy.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.249

I know, sweetie.
I know that you're tired, honey.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.054
But you have
to keep talking to me.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.490
We're getting so close, okay?

28:44.523 --> 28:46.458
You keep saying that,
but you're not.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.294
He'll be back soon.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.362
I'll hear him on the stairs.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.298
The stairs?

28:52.331 --> 28:54.066
When he comes to see me.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.503
Sometimes just his footsteps.

28:57.536 --> 28:59.271
Sometimes more.

28:59.305 --> 29:05.211
Those days I want to die.

you gotta stay with me.

you're with me, okay?

I'm a day trader.
I live on Long Island.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.461
Then why do you have
the keys to the store?

37:42.494 --> 37:43.795
It belongs to my dad.

37:43.829 --> 37:44.896
I hardly ever come here.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.633
I'm trying to sell it.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.935
Then where are you gonna make
your child porn?

37:49.968 --> 37:51.903
I would never do such a thing.

37:51.937 --> 37:55.040
I swear, I haven't been down
here in years.

37:55.073 --> 37:57.409
Maybe one of the people
who worked for my dad kept keys.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.044
I can give you names.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.612
Why are you here tonight?

38:00.646 --> 38:03.982
I had a business meeting
downtown.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.651
I stopped by to check
everything was okay--

38:05.684 --> 38:07.519
You know where she is.

38:07.553 --> 38:08.920
Now, if she dies,

38:08.954 --> 38:11.790
I promise you I will make
the rest of your life hell.

38:11.823 --> 38:12.791
You can't do this
to me.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.393
I want my lawyer.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.528
[grunts]

38:25.437 --> 38:27.072
I want my lawyer.

38:44.990 --> 38:45.991
Fin!

38:50.562 --> 38:51.763
If I'm not under arrest,
I want to go.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.832
You said you had
a business meeting.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.666
That's right.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.468
So why have you got
mud on your shoes?

39:01.673 --> 39:05.744
Get off me!
You can't do this!

39:05.777 --> 39:06.878
Soon as the lab gets this,

39:06.912 --> 39:08.780
they're gonna tell us
exactly where you buried her.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.450
Last chance, Richard.

39:11.483 --> 39:15.621
Where is she?

39:15.654 --> 39:16.655
Ahh!

39:20.125 --> 39:21.960
Liv, look at this.
Burnt wood.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.495
Felipe's Burgers burned down.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.731
There was charred beams.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.902
She's in the empty lot.

39:36.808 --> 39:37.809
Okay, divide it up.

39:37.843 --> 39:38.810
Look for any disturbed

39:38.844 --> 39:39.978
or darker earth footprints.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.012
Let's go.

39:58.697 --> 39:59.865
I got something!

39:59.898 --> 40:02.568
This ground's
been disturbed.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.670
Footprint.

40:04.703 --> 40:05.737
(Benson)
We need to dig!

40:05.771 --> 40:07.439
Get some tools!

40:07.473 --> 40:09.775
Okay, use wood,
get pieces of fence--anything!

40:23.254 --> 40:24.823
Wait!

40:24.856 --> 40:25.824
Wait!

40:25.857 --> 40:26.858
Dig! Dig!

40:31.563 --> 40:33.565
What the hell
is this?

40:36.735 --> 40:37.703
Oh, God.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.070
[gasps]

40:48.814 --> 40:50.181
(Fin)
I smell chloroform.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.249
Oh, God.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.250
Help me lift her up.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.886
Come on, come on.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.254
She's not breathing.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.723
Okay.

41:01.192 --> 41:04.530
Stay with me.
Come on, Maria.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.533
Come on, girl.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.734
Come on, yeah.

41:08.767 --> 41:09.868
[coughs]

41:09.901 --> 41:13.539
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

41:13.572 --> 41:17.843
Good girl.
It's okay.

41:17.876 --> 41:24.082
It's okay, Maria.
It's okay.

41:27.853 --> 41:30.989
[whispers]
Olivia.

41:45.937 --> 41:46.004
