WEBVTT

00:01.336 --> 00:02.959
- Lunch, one o'clock?
- 12:30.

00:02.984 --> 00:04.016
Oh, yeah, right.

00:04.041 --> 00:05.941
Hey.

00:09.006 --> 00:11.073
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:15.623 --> 00:17.614
- Morning, Dr. Halstead.
- Good morning.

00:17.639 --> 00:19.083
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait.

00:19.108 --> 00:20.674
Dr. Wheeler, you got one in 3.

00:20.699 --> 00:21.990
- Be there in a minute.
- Okay.

00:22.015 --> 00:24.150
- Morning, Jeff.
- Hey, man.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

01:33.613 --> 01:36.281
This is obviously a tremendous shock.

01:36.306 --> 01:38.636
Dr. Wheeler was one of us.

01:38.952 --> 01:41.886
And the burden of processing
all that has happened

01:41.911 --> 01:45.105
will be a long and... and difficult one,

01:45.825 --> 01:49.212
so there would be no judgment on anyone

01:49.237 --> 01:52.863
who would prefer not to be here today.

01:54.601 --> 01:56.568
At times like this,
talking about anything,

01:56.593 --> 01:58.926
even the weather, never hurt anyone,

01:58.951 --> 02:00.581
so my colleague Dr. Richardson

02:00.606 --> 02:02.273
has made herself available all day.

02:02.298 --> 02:05.377
She'll be up in her office
if anybody wants to stop by.

02:05.546 --> 02:08.680
Okay? All right, thank you.

02:08.738 --> 02:10.937
Ms. Goodwin, in my experience,

02:10.963 --> 02:12.951
the key to maintaining
morale in times like this is

02:12.976 --> 02:14.185
to keep things running smoothly.

02:14.210 --> 02:16.469
- Of course.
- Okay if I take Dr. Reese

02:16.494 --> 02:17.827
to fill in for the day?

02:17.852 --> 02:19.807
Dr. Charles?

02:20.325 --> 02:23.894
- Sure.
- Thank you.

02:24.147 --> 02:26.764
Maggie, waiting room's full.
Let's keep 'em moving.

02:26.789 --> 02:29.567
- Trying, Dr. Choi.
- What have we got?

02:29.592 --> 02:31.757
Kid who fell in the river
about five minutes out,

02:31.782 --> 02:32.947
Good Samaritan right behind.

02:32.972 --> 02:34.461
Bunch of runny noses and earaches,

02:34.486 --> 02:36.532
and abdominal pain in 6.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.896
Dr. Manning, you're on the kid.

02:37.921 --> 02:39.226
Clarke and Sexton, stand by to assist.

02:39.251 --> 02:41.952
Reese, you're on deck.
Everyone else, take a room.

02:41.977 --> 02:44.578
Let's go. Don't worry.
We'll get through this.

02:48.649 --> 02:51.147
Hi. I'm Dr. Choi.
Heard you're having some belly pain.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.952
- Yeah. It's not a big deal.
- He fell down the stairs.

02:53.977 --> 02:55.384
Really? How'd that happen?

02:55.516 --> 02:57.636
Aah! It was nothing.

02:57.661 --> 03:00.158
He was carrying a pretty
heavy box of books.

03:00.183 --> 03:02.474
We're packing up to move next week.

03:02.499 --> 03:04.560
And everyone thinks
reading's good for you.

03:05.266 --> 03:07.710
Might have a broken rib.
I'd like to get some scans

03:07.735 --> 03:09.414
and make sure there's
nothing else going on,

03:09.439 --> 03:11.047
but it doesn't look too serious.

03:11.072 --> 03:13.277
I'll be back to check
on you in a little bit.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.023
Um...

03:17.173 --> 03:19.812
- Is there anything else?
- No. It's...

03:19.837 --> 03:21.991
It's just...
he's been a little clumsy lately.

03:22.016 --> 03:24.593
But that's normal, right?
Tripping over his feet?

03:24.618 --> 03:26.118
He's just growing into his body.

03:26.143 --> 03:27.976
It's probably nothing,
but since we got some time,

03:28.001 --> 03:30.635
I'll run some blood to rule out
any infections or toxicities

03:30.660 --> 03:31.492
just to be sure.

03:31.517 --> 03:32.984
Thank you.

03:33.682 --> 03:36.850
- Need any help?
- We got it.

03:37.353 --> 03:39.928
- Mags, put him in Baghdad?
- Already on it, Dr. Choi.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.547
Dustin Banks, eight years old.

03:41.572 --> 03:43.043
Fell through the ice into the river.

03:43.068 --> 03:44.657
15 minutes before he was pulled out.

03:44.682 --> 03:48.050
Heart's in Brady-arrest.
Core temp 27 degrees Celsius.

03:48.129 --> 03:50.229
Cold and dead, Sexton?
What do you think?

03:50.363 --> 03:52.766
Uh, that he's not dead
until he's warm and dead?

03:52.791 --> 03:54.672
You just won the first
shift of compressions.

03:54.697 --> 03:56.564
All right. On my count.

03:56.589 --> 03:58.984
One, two, three.

03:59.416 --> 04:02.375
April, I need to intubate.
50 of sux, 10 of etomidate.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.653
- On it.
- Can he hear me? Dustin!

04:04.678 --> 04:05.812
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:05.837 --> 04:09.539
The doctor will be with you
as soon as she can, okay?

04:12.371 --> 04:14.129
Jim Kessler, 58. Had a STEMI

04:14.154 --> 04:15.753
after jumping in the
river to save the kid.

04:15.778 --> 04:19.551
Aspirin and nitro in the field.
Sinus rhythm now 120/80.

04:19.632 --> 04:22.170
Mr. Kessler, I'm Dr.
Reese. Can you hear me?

04:22.195 --> 04:23.883
- Sure can.
- Great.

04:23.908 --> 04:26.074
On the count of three, let's move him.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.019
One, two, three.

04:32.075 --> 04:35.042
- Meds are in.
- Maggie, get an ECMO unit.

04:35.185 --> 04:36.852
Pneumonia season.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.328
Every single one's in use upstairs.

04:38.353 --> 04:40.131
He's not gonna wake up
till he's 95 degrees.

04:40.156 --> 04:41.045
What about bypass?

04:41.070 --> 04:42.190
They're both in surgery.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.461
We can get one down here
in about 90 minutes.

04:44.691 --> 04:46.258
Then we're gonna have to
keep his heart beating

04:46.283 --> 04:48.650
- until we get it.
- Compressions for 90 minutes?

04:48.675 --> 04:50.232
In five-minute shifts.
And we'll warm him

04:50.257 --> 04:51.700
the best we can with a left lung lavage.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.202
Jeff, we need two 32-french chest tubes.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.039
April, get a warmer and all
the saline in the hospital.

04:56.064 --> 04:56.672
Let's go.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.554
Left lung lavage? Sure it'll work?

04:58.579 --> 05:00.178
We're gonna try.

05:00.203 --> 05:02.621
Dr. Manning, this is David Banks,
Dustin's father.

05:02.646 --> 05:06.070
- Is he gonna be okay?
- It's too soon to tell.

05:06.095 --> 05:09.530
The benefit of hypothermia is
it preserves brain function.

05:09.555 --> 05:10.952
But if we don't warm him fast enough,

05:10.977 --> 05:13.484
the cold will eventually
overwhelm his body,

05:13.509 --> 05:16.570
so we're gonna circulate warm
saline through his chest cavity

05:16.595 --> 05:18.828
until we can put him on bypass, okay?

05:18.852 --> 05:21.071
Okay, the warmer's on its way,
but for this amount of saline,

05:21.096 --> 05:22.797
Central Supply needs a doctor's order.

05:22.822 --> 05:27.911
Okay. I promise you we are
gonna do everything that we can.

05:32.843 --> 05:36.011
Your EKG shows ST elevations.
Definitely a heart attack.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.640
Ever had any heart problems before?

05:37.665 --> 05:39.225
Little chest pain here and there.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.648
My doc's got me on some pills.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.784
Okay, well, he should've told you

05:41.809 --> 05:43.141
not to jump in a frozen river.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.922
The shock is probably what
tipped you over the edge.

05:44.947 --> 05:47.481
Everybody's a Monday
morning quarterback.

05:47.821 --> 05:49.563
I don't know what that means,

05:49.588 --> 05:51.299
but I do know that we need to assess

05:51.324 --> 05:53.032
the extent of your
coronary artery disease,

05:53.057 --> 05:54.898
so I want to send you
up to the cath lab.

05:54.923 --> 05:57.672
Long as there's some hot cocoa
in it for me, you got a deal.

05:57.697 --> 06:00.236
All right. I'll check
back in with you soon.

06:02.118 --> 06:03.618
Activate the STEMI protocol.

06:03.643 --> 06:05.539
And uh, call Dr. Rhodes for a consult.

06:05.564 --> 06:07.063
You got it.

06:10.827 --> 06:12.664
He got off lucky.

06:12.997 --> 06:17.110
He could've gone into cold shock,
v-fib, coagulopathy.

06:17.634 --> 06:20.768
What a great but crazy thing to do.

06:20.793 --> 06:22.593
He probably didn't even think about it.

06:22.618 --> 06:25.919
Just saw a kid in trouble and reacted.

06:39.326 --> 06:40.792
Thank you.

06:46.166 --> 06:47.825
Hey, Nat.

06:48.061 --> 06:49.910
Hey, Jay.

06:51.014 --> 06:52.848
It's a tough day, huh?

06:52.873 --> 06:54.382
Yeah.

06:54.407 --> 06:56.375
Just hang in there.

06:56.918 --> 06:58.551
Thank you.

07:03.617 --> 07:07.639
All right.
All Kevin's scans show are a broken rib

07:07.664 --> 07:09.193
and a pretty good bruise on his kidney,

07:09.218 --> 07:10.881
so I agree with Dr. Choi.

07:10.906 --> 07:12.943
There's no neurologic reason he fell.

07:12.968 --> 07:14.031
He simply slipped.

07:14.056 --> 07:16.046
I'd like nephrology to get
a look just to be safe,

07:16.071 --> 07:17.429
but then he should be okay to leave.

07:17.454 --> 07:19.897
So, he'll be all right to
drive across country next week?

07:19.922 --> 07:21.797
- Mom.
- Shh. Let the doctor talk.

07:21.821 --> 07:23.521
Might be a little uncomfortable,

07:23.546 --> 07:24.788
but he'll be fine.

07:24.813 --> 07:26.718
- Thank you for all your help.
- You got it.

07:26.743 --> 07:29.110
My advice: bring some pillows.

07:31.945 --> 07:34.359
Lead levels and Lyme titers?

07:34.881 --> 07:37.241
Pretty aggressive workup for a
kid who just slipped and fell.

07:37.266 --> 07:39.166
Nothing wrong with covering our bases.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.578
- Hey, Maggie?
- Mm-hmm?

07:43.603 --> 07:46.174
How's the resuscitation going?

07:46.439 --> 07:48.450
Getting 20 people from
5 different departments

07:48.475 --> 07:50.231
to work seamlessly together...

07:50.291 --> 07:51.606
What could go wrong?

07:51.631 --> 07:54.265
- Mm. Well, you keep me updated.
- Yeah.

07:54.290 --> 07:56.758
Let me ask you: did Dr. Wheeler have

07:56.783 --> 08:00.528
any interpersonal issues
with anyone on staff?

08:00.553 --> 08:03.453
I mean, I don't know. I don't think so.

08:03.530 --> 08:05.902
But he was making some
pretty big mistakes lately.

08:05.927 --> 08:08.646
Yeah, and it was getting worse
after the drinking incident.

08:08.678 --> 08:10.318
- Mm-hmm.
- Was there anything

08:10.343 --> 08:13.827
that, um, might have
been weighing on him?

08:13.860 --> 08:16.727
I mean, you can tell that he
was losing his confidence.

08:16.752 --> 08:21.055
Hm. Um, okay, then.
I'll let you get back to work.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.646
All right.

08:22.671 --> 08:24.216
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

08:24.241 --> 08:26.521
- I was told to ask for you.
- Okay.

08:26.546 --> 08:28.818
I'm Dr. Wheeler's father.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.716
I need help! Can somebody help me?

08:32.741 --> 08:34.489
- What happened?
- I don't know.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.434
He... he can't move.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.010
Kevin, squeeze my fingers.

08:40.035 --> 08:42.648
Just... wait, wait.

08:46.646 --> 08:48.716
Can you feel my hand?

08:51.213 --> 08:53.492
All right, let's get him to CT, now.

08:53.802 --> 08:55.980
What? What's happening?

08:56.005 --> 08:57.215
I think your son's having a stroke.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.622
Oh, my God, Kevin, no.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.085
So, the episodes that
he's been having recently

09:07.110 --> 09:08.102
could've been TIAs.

09:08.127 --> 09:09.717
They may have been coming for some time.

09:09.742 --> 09:12.492
Well, it's possible.
But the CT looks negative.

09:12.517 --> 09:14.589
It is. However, there can be a delay

09:14.614 --> 09:16.367
before an embolic stroke
shows up on the scan.

09:16.392 --> 09:18.289
Exactly. Which is why we need an MRI.

09:18.314 --> 09:20.921
- Right.
- An MRI? That'll take an hour.

09:20.946 --> 09:22.812
His stroke could be evolving
right before our eyes.

09:22.837 --> 09:24.504
- If it is a stroke.
- His left side's

09:24.529 --> 09:25.938
completely paralyzed...
What else could it be?

09:25.963 --> 09:28.539
I don't know. That's why I want an MRI.

09:28.564 --> 09:31.081
Every minute we wait to break
up the clot in his brain

09:31.106 --> 09:33.534
increases the odds of his
paralysis becoming permanent.

09:33.559 --> 09:34.574
He needs tPA.

09:34.599 --> 09:36.557
Whoa, well, he's also
got a bruised kidney.

09:36.582 --> 09:38.356
TPA could cause a massive hemorrhage.

09:38.381 --> 09:39.253
We cannot risk that

09:39.278 --> 09:40.718
until we know for sure
what we're treating.

09:40.743 --> 09:43.386
You've still got more than
a two-hour window for tPA.

09:43.411 --> 09:45.623
I can get him in and out
of the MRI in 40 minutes.

09:45.648 --> 09:47.504
Good. Do it.

09:58.858 --> 10:01.258
I'm sorry about your resident.

10:01.283 --> 10:03.353
He wasn't my resident.

10:06.297 --> 10:08.797
Yeah. Thanks.

10:08.822 --> 10:10.188
Yeah, it's awful.

10:10.213 --> 10:12.414
I mean, residency...
Who doesn't consider doing it?

10:12.439 --> 10:15.742
Still,
you never think anybody actually will.

10:15.775 --> 10:19.600
- You thought about suicide?
- Of course. Didn't you?

10:19.625 --> 10:21.358
No.

10:21.383 --> 10:24.397
Huh. That's unusual.

10:32.703 --> 10:35.570
You have moderate three-vessel disease.

10:35.595 --> 10:38.240
But given the fact that you've
already had a cardiac event,

10:38.265 --> 10:39.434
it is my recommendation

10:39.459 --> 10:41.851
that we do a coronary
artery bypass graft.

10:42.385 --> 10:44.342
This is pretty major surgery, right?

10:44.367 --> 10:47.132
It is, but you are an
excellent candidate.

10:47.184 --> 10:49.551
So I'd like to give your
heart a day to rest,

10:49.576 --> 10:51.616
and then we can get you on
the schedule for tomorrow.

10:55.068 --> 10:56.567
If you say so, let's do it.

10:56.592 --> 11:01.233
Great. By the way,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

11:01.258 --> 11:03.295
I hear that you are quite the hero.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.280
No.

11:05.305 --> 11:06.968
Just lucky I happened to be there.

11:06.993 --> 11:09.998
Well, either way, thank you.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.483
H-how did you know he needed help?

11:16.508 --> 11:18.208
What do you mean? He was drowning.

11:18.233 --> 11:22.568
No. I understand.
But what went through your head

11:22.593 --> 11:24.991
the moment before you jumped in?

11:25.198 --> 11:27.031
Was it... was it an actual decision,

11:27.056 --> 11:29.815
or was it more like an
instinct kicking in?

11:31.129 --> 11:32.818
I don't know.

11:33.369 --> 11:35.469
We should let you get your rest.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.248
Dr. Reese will be back

11:37.273 --> 11:39.100
when we have a room
ready for you upstairs.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.658
Dr. Reese?

11:42.303 --> 11:44.139
Dr. Reese, are you okay?

11:44.478 --> 11:47.579
What? Yeah. I'm fine.

11:47.714 --> 11:50.627
Yeah, everything's fine.
I'm gonna go check on the room.

11:53.051 --> 11:55.553
Where is he? My son, Dustin. Where...

11:55.578 --> 11:57.987
Mrs. Banks? Hi. I'm Dr. Manning.

11:58.012 --> 11:59.459
Your son is right here.

11:59.484 --> 12:01.334
But let me just explain to you
what's going on first, okay?

12:01.359 --> 12:03.014
Cheryl, I don't know what happened.
I was right...

12:03.039 --> 12:04.641
This is your fault!

12:05.079 --> 12:07.769
You are a terrible father.

12:08.609 --> 12:10.227
Mrs. Banks, please,

12:10.252 --> 12:12.941
let me just explain to
you what's going on, okay?

12:18.116 --> 12:21.321
Hey. How come you're getting a snack?
It's time for lunch.

12:21.346 --> 12:23.824
I'm sorry. We've been slammed.
I got to get back.

12:23.849 --> 12:25.582
Okay. But you could've texted

12:25.607 --> 12:27.193
and saved me the drive across town.

12:27.218 --> 12:28.709
I told you I haven't had a second.

12:28.734 --> 12:30.297
You had time to get a snack, though.

12:30.322 --> 12:33.286
- Fine. You win.
- That's a great answer.

12:33.311 --> 12:35.319
I'm sorry my dying patient
inconvenienced you.

12:35.344 --> 12:37.529
- Come on, April.
- What do you want me to say?

12:37.554 --> 12:39.443
That's just how you justify
everything... your work.

12:39.468 --> 12:40.936
Now you're gonna start in on my work?

12:40.961 --> 12:44.196
Nah. I'm going. Rather
eat by myself anyway.

12:59.538 --> 13:00.871
You ever seen this before?

13:00.896 --> 13:03.513
A resident ending it like this?

13:04.302 --> 13:07.647
Unfortunately, I have.
Yeah. Several times.

13:11.340 --> 13:13.474
You know that 400 doctors

13:13.499 --> 13:14.748
take their own lives every year, right?

13:14.773 --> 13:16.606
Most of any profession.

13:16.631 --> 13:18.831
I don't have a lot of
evidence to back this up,

13:18.856 --> 13:21.023
but I got a strong hunch
it's got something to do

13:21.048 --> 13:23.701
with taking people who have
a powerful desire to help

13:23.786 --> 13:25.403
and throwing them into a game

13:25.428 --> 13:27.849
where the odds are just
stacked against them.

13:28.487 --> 13:31.303
I mean, this I do know:
situations like this,

13:31.328 --> 13:33.461
it's never just one thing.

13:33.628 --> 13:35.995
It's always a complex
set of circumstances,

13:36.020 --> 13:38.888
and, um, you know,
trying to figure it out,

13:38.913 --> 13:40.362
trying to assign blame...

13:40.499 --> 13:43.688
It's pretty pointless.

13:58.619 --> 14:01.987
Hey, thanks for getting
him a bed so fast.

14:08.196 --> 14:09.929
Tough day, huh?

14:14.645 --> 14:16.973
You and Dr. Wheeler were friends?

14:17.572 --> 14:19.638
No. I hardly knew him.

14:24.841 --> 14:26.825
He came to me...

14:27.756 --> 14:29.578
twice...

14:31.294 --> 14:35.792
asking about pills, about therapy.

14:36.878 --> 14:38.995
And that wasn't really
what he was asking for.

14:39.020 --> 14:42.087
He was asking for help.

14:45.233 --> 14:48.151
I don't know why he came to me,
but he did, and now he's dead.

14:52.073 --> 14:55.040
What kind of terrible
psychiatrist am I gonna be?

15:00.425 --> 15:02.725
You can't jump in and
save everyone, Reese.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.583
It's just not possible.

15:04.608 --> 15:06.893
It's not that I didn't
jump in to save him.

15:06.918 --> 15:09.418
I didn't even see that he was drowning.

15:10.445 --> 15:12.165
Dr. Rhodes, better come here.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.878
BP's dropping, ST segments are elevated.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.043
He's barely got a pulse.

15:21.068 --> 15:23.587
He's in cardiogenic shock.
It must be another MI.

15:23.612 --> 15:25.379
We're gonna balloon-pump him.

15:25.537 --> 15:28.381
Bolus heparin, start
dopamine, dobutamine.

15:28.406 --> 15:29.487
- Get him on high-flow O2.
- Got it.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.605
I'll tell the cath lab we're coming.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.349
There's no time. We're gonna do it here.

15:32.374 --> 15:33.725
We're...

15:34.279 --> 15:36.728
How will we know if
we're in the right place?

15:36.753 --> 15:39.688
If he bleeds out,
we'll know we punctured the iliac.

15:39.713 --> 15:42.439
If he stops breathing,
then we perforated into the mediastinum.

15:42.464 --> 15:45.136
But if we don't get his blood
pressure back up right now,

15:45.161 --> 15:47.195
none of that's gonna matter anyways.

15:53.605 --> 15:55.581
Hang in there, Jim.

16:05.700 --> 16:06.996
Let me know when you see it.

16:07.021 --> 16:08.905
Almost there. Got it.

16:12.247 --> 16:14.349
Almost there, Jim.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.944
I got you.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.144
All right, turn it on.

16:22.892 --> 16:25.243
Come on, come on, come on, come on...

16:25.268 --> 16:29.298
Pressure's coming up. 70/35.

16:29.516 --> 16:31.055
80/40.

16:31.080 --> 16:34.202
Okay. Get him ready to go upstairs.

16:41.283 --> 16:43.128
Still no improvement.

16:43.997 --> 16:45.897
He's always been so healthy.

16:45.993 --> 16:48.332
What could cause a
stroke in a 15-year-old?

16:48.357 --> 16:51.094
Not much. And he's negative
for the usual suspects,

16:51.119 --> 16:53.597
so if his MRI is positive,
we'll have to start looking

16:53.622 --> 16:54.931
for less common causes.

16:54.956 --> 16:56.823
I'm not gonna have to
stay overnight, am I?

16:56.848 --> 16:57.913
Kevin, not now.

16:57.938 --> 16:59.729
Dr. Halstead, Dr. Choi?

17:00.001 --> 17:01.559
Excuse us.

17:01.765 --> 17:03.698
- MRI?
- Yeah.

17:04.076 --> 17:06.242
Still no evidence of a stroke.
This can't be right.

17:06.268 --> 17:07.376
Well, it may not be.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.430
It says it's a poor study
due to patient movement.

17:09.454 --> 17:10.922
So it's inconclusive.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.102
Tell MRI we're sending him
back up for a repeat scan.

17:13.127 --> 17:14.079
Are you kidding? If this is a stroke,

17:14.105 --> 17:15.972
we're running out of time.

17:16.162 --> 17:19.352
Doesn't his affect strike you as weird?
So little concern?

17:19.377 --> 17:21.777
He's a confused teenager
who's probably also in shock.

17:21.824 --> 17:23.189
Well, I don't like
it. It doesn't add up.

17:23.214 --> 17:24.734
And we should figure
it out after we treat

17:24.760 --> 17:27.297
what may soon become
permanent paralysis.

17:27.919 --> 17:29.473
I'm not gonna risk a massive hemorrhage

17:29.498 --> 17:30.915
and a transfusion for no reason.

17:30.940 --> 17:32.606
He's going back to MRI.

17:36.745 --> 17:38.044
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:38.069 --> 17:39.995
I just spoke with CCU.
Mr. Kessler's pressure

17:40.020 --> 17:40.957
still isn't coming up.

17:40.982 --> 17:42.799
Okay. We'll give it a few more minutes,

17:42.824 --> 17:44.939
and if it doesn't improve,
I'll have to operate.

17:44.965 --> 17:46.598
Okay.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.906
Wheeler came to me, too, Reese,

17:53.591 --> 17:55.586
when we had that
pile-up in the blizzard,

17:55.611 --> 17:58.119
and the pregnant woman almost bled out.

17:58.826 --> 18:00.459
He took it hard.

18:00.484 --> 18:03.165
I had the chance to reassure him,
but I didn't.

18:03.925 --> 18:05.691
All right. I appreciate
that you're trying

18:05.716 --> 18:08.545
to make me feel better, but it doesn't.

18:09.257 --> 18:11.324
I'm gonna go check on Mr. Kessler.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.847
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Noah.

18:22.872 --> 18:24.331
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:24.356 --> 18:26.189
Let me... Let me help you.

18:26.440 --> 18:31.343
Hey, um, I saw you and
Tate getting a little edgy.

18:31.368 --> 18:33.058
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

18:33.083 --> 18:36.161
Yeah? Okay, good.
I just don't want you to, you know...

18:36.186 --> 18:37.856
What? Screw things up?

18:37.881 --> 18:39.308
What? No, no.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.973
I just want you to be happy...

18:40.998 --> 18:45.500
with a guy... who was a all-pro
wide receiver three times.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.158
Three times, right?

18:52.409 --> 18:54.855
Okay, everybody,
the bypass machine just opened up.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.124
We need to get him upstairs now.

18:56.149 --> 18:57.527
So you'll be able to warm him up?

18:57.552 --> 18:59.066
Much faster, yes.

18:59.091 --> 19:01.300
And it hasn't been too long, right?
He might still be okay?

19:01.325 --> 19:03.001
We won't know about his
neurological function

19:03.026 --> 19:05.126
until he wakes up,
but this is definitely a step

19:05.151 --> 19:06.253
in the right direction.

19:08.963 --> 19:11.139
- Thank you, Dr. Manning.
- Of course.

19:11.164 --> 19:13.778
I can't tell you how much
we both appreciate this.

19:14.984 --> 19:17.760
- He's ready to go.
- Okay. Let's do it.

19:20.634 --> 19:22.729
- Hold on.
- Ms. Goodwin?

19:22.754 --> 19:26.133
They need the bypass machine
upstairs for an emergency case.

19:26.158 --> 19:27.689
What do you mean, an emergency?

19:27.714 --> 19:30.427
It's for Mr. Kessler,
the man who saved your son.

19:30.452 --> 19:32.806
They need to operate on him immediately.

19:32.831 --> 19:35.765
But it was promised to us!
We've been waiting for it.

19:35.790 --> 19:37.523
Plus that man would
want Dustin to have it.

19:37.548 --> 19:40.017
There can't be a bigger
emergency than this.

19:40.042 --> 19:42.056
My son is dying.

19:42.769 --> 19:44.931
Are you just gonna stand
there and do nothing?

19:44.956 --> 19:47.572
Mrs. Banks, Dustin still has options,

19:47.612 --> 19:49.570
other ways of continuing to warm.

19:49.595 --> 19:52.861
Mr. Kessler does not.
Without surgery, he will die.

19:52.886 --> 19:57.071
My son is going to die. Tell her.

19:57.217 --> 19:59.291
Put him back on the monitors.

19:59.417 --> 20:01.950
Wait. Wait!

20:02.324 --> 20:03.957
Are you giving up?

20:03.982 --> 20:06.236
No. But Ms. Goodwin is right.

20:06.261 --> 20:08.999
We can try peritoneal
lavage to speed things up.

20:09.024 --> 20:11.095
You are his doctor.
You're supposed to fight

20:11.120 --> 20:12.086
for your patients.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.464
My son is only eight years old.

20:14.489 --> 20:16.423
What kind of a monster are you?

20:16.448 --> 20:17.842
Mrs. Banks.

20:18.304 --> 20:22.847
Mrs. Banks, I am truly, truly sorry.

20:25.964 --> 20:28.798
- April, set up for the lavage.
- On it.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.149
The waiting room's
backed up again, Maggie.

20:34.212 --> 20:36.726
I'm doing my best, Dr. Choi.

20:37.098 --> 20:38.965
We need to do better.

20:46.211 --> 20:49.445
Too many people losing focus today.
It's dangerous.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.198
Is that right?

20:53.068 --> 20:55.101
That patient in there, Kevin,

20:55.126 --> 20:56.889
15-year-old with hemi-paresis,

20:56.914 --> 20:58.790
but his attending is fixated on his mood

20:58.815 --> 21:00.626
rather than his symptoms.

21:00.986 --> 21:02.751
What do you mean?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.013
He seems a little detached.

21:06.171 --> 21:08.471
But he's just a kid
trying to play it cool.

21:08.496 --> 21:10.933
So now we're wasting valuable
time ordering scan after scan

21:10.958 --> 21:12.190
when we should be treating him.

21:12.215 --> 21:15.650
Well, I mean, surely this attending

21:15.675 --> 21:17.276
gave you his reasons, right?

21:17.301 --> 21:18.861
He did.

21:19.909 --> 21:23.026
But I think the incident this morning

21:23.051 --> 21:24.701
is clouding his judgment.

21:25.797 --> 21:27.526
I'm not sure he should be working today.

21:27.551 --> 21:29.122
Really?

21:29.503 --> 21:32.432
Dr. Charles,
we're in the business of saving lives,

21:32.457 --> 21:34.745
and the moment people lose
confidence in their leader,

21:34.770 --> 21:36.337
the fight is lost.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.529
We've already had one casualty today.

21:38.554 --> 21:40.621
I won't have another.

21:59.505 --> 22:01.754
Kevin, how are you?

22:01.779 --> 22:04.380
I'm Dr. Charles. Hey.

22:04.405 --> 22:06.130
I understand you're
having a little trouble

22:06.155 --> 22:07.639
with your left side.

22:07.664 --> 22:09.936
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.888
How you doing with that?
I know it can be a little scary.

22:13.019 --> 22:15.086
It's not that big a deal.

22:21.609 --> 22:22.842
Excuse me, Dr. Charles,

22:22.867 --> 22:24.633
this patient's schedule for an MRI.

22:24.658 --> 22:28.171
Yes. Okay.

22:28.353 --> 22:31.888
- Well, um, nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

22:43.020 --> 22:44.855
Metz and DeBakeys.

22:53.966 --> 22:55.894
Let's get him cannulated for bypass,

22:55.919 --> 22:57.566
and get me a sheet of woven patch.

22:57.591 --> 23:00.279
Woven patch? I thought we were
doing a three-vessel CABG.

23:00.304 --> 23:02.388
Change of plans. This isn't an MI.

23:02.413 --> 23:04.173
Page Dr. Reese. Tell her I need her now.

23:04.198 --> 23:05.864
3.0?

23:23.743 --> 23:26.948
- How's he doing?
- Still only 89 degrees.

23:28.455 --> 23:32.091
Look, I know Dr. Wheeler
had a difficult time here.

23:32.116 --> 23:34.516
Did he ever talk to you about it?

23:34.541 --> 23:36.641
- No.
- Was there anyone

23:36.675 --> 23:38.053
he might have talked to?

23:38.078 --> 23:38.960
A confidant?

23:38.985 --> 23:41.819
- Honestly, I have no idea.
- Okay.

23:41.844 --> 23:44.257
- Uh, Ms. Goodwin?
- Yes?

23:44.978 --> 23:48.575
I spent eight months
working alongside someone

23:48.600 --> 23:52.122
who was in so much pain
that he took his own life,

23:52.147 --> 23:54.308
and I never even noticed.

23:56.337 --> 23:58.615
Am I a monster?

23:59.338 --> 24:02.997
No, Dr. Manning.

24:04.077 --> 24:06.144
No, you're not.

24:43.784 --> 24:45.893
Excuse me. I'm looking for my friend.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.464
Is this the visitors entrance?

24:47.489 --> 24:48.988
Uh, for the ED, yeah.

24:49.013 --> 24:50.713
Has he been admitted yet?

24:50.738 --> 24:53.051
I don't know.
He said he can't move his arm or leg.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.535
It sounds really bad.

24:55.283 --> 24:57.478
His name wouldn't be Kevin,
by any chance, would it?

24:57.503 --> 24:59.370
- Yeah, it is.
- Huh.

24:59.395 --> 25:02.972
Tell me: is your buddy,
like, a real cool customer?

25:02.997 --> 25:05.131
You know, like a James Dean type?

25:05.156 --> 25:06.355
Who's James Dean?

25:06.380 --> 25:08.184
What I mean is, um,

25:08.209 --> 25:09.742
is he the kind of guy
that doesn't really get

25:09.767 --> 25:11.302
too worked up about stuff?

25:11.327 --> 25:13.071
Kevin? You're kidding.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.472
They're making him move to California.

25:14.497 --> 25:17.261
- Of course he's worked up.
- He's got to move?

25:17.286 --> 25:19.519
Yeah. They're just dragging him away.

25:19.544 --> 25:21.343
Huh.

25:21.469 --> 25:23.089
You're gonna miss him, huh?

25:23.114 --> 25:24.649
Yeah.

25:25.562 --> 25:27.695
Sorry... tell me your
name. I'm Dr. Charles.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.721
- Emmett.
- Emmett. Nice to meet you.

25:29.746 --> 25:31.854
Um, I think that there might be a chance

25:31.879 --> 25:33.164
that we could help your friend.

25:33.189 --> 25:36.550
- Could we go see him together?
- Yeah. Okay.

25:46.909 --> 25:49.829
Dr. Rhodes, why did you bring me here?

25:49.854 --> 25:51.369
I can't assist on a bypass graft.

25:51.394 --> 25:53.612
We're not doing a bypass graft.

25:53.811 --> 25:56.379
- What? But I...
- Look.

26:01.359 --> 26:03.726
A ventricular septal defect?

26:03.751 --> 26:04.991
From necrosis.

26:05.016 --> 26:07.131
Lack of blood flow from his
heart attack at the river

26:07.156 --> 26:09.490
caused a small patch of muscle to die.

26:09.515 --> 26:12.060
That's impossible to find.
How did you even know to look?

26:12.085 --> 26:14.162
- You see this discoloration?
- Uh-huh.

26:14.187 --> 26:15.783
I missed this once.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.536
Guy died before we even
got him off the table.

26:20.351 --> 26:23.895
I know that you feel like
you let Wheeler down,

26:23.920 --> 26:25.960
like you missed the signs
of him needing help.

26:26.073 --> 26:30.027
As doctors, all we can
do is learn from that

26:30.052 --> 26:32.118
and try not to miss them again.

26:38.849 --> 26:40.840
Maggie,
when's Kevin Roth getting back from MRI?

26:40.865 --> 26:42.474
Didn't you get Dr. Choi's message?

26:42.499 --> 26:45.033
He took your patient to
interventional radiology.

26:45.058 --> 26:46.524
What?

26:51.818 --> 26:54.170
Do not administer that tPA!

26:55.608 --> 26:57.658
Dr. Choi, now.

26:59.694 --> 27:01.277
The hell are you doing?

27:01.302 --> 27:02.802
His window's nearly
closed. I had no choice.

27:02.828 --> 27:04.808
No, you don't have a choice.
I'm your attending.

27:04.833 --> 27:06.833
And you're not willing to
do what the patient needs.

27:06.858 --> 27:09.358
So, you're 100% sure of the
correct clinical course?

27:09.383 --> 27:10.826
Because to me, this is
not a clear-cut case.

27:10.851 --> 27:13.279
Doesn't mean we can avoid
making the hard decisions.

27:13.304 --> 27:15.333
Even if those decisions might kill him?

27:15.421 --> 27:19.622
Gentlemen, if we could take a beat,

27:19.647 --> 27:21.401
this young man might
help us shed some light

27:21.426 --> 27:23.493
on the situation.

27:30.044 --> 27:32.044
- Hey, man.
- Emmett,

27:32.069 --> 27:34.042
what are you doing here?

27:34.257 --> 27:36.160
I was worried.

27:36.718 --> 27:38.884
You were worried about me?

27:38.909 --> 27:41.838
Yeah, man. Your text
said you couldn't move.

27:41.863 --> 27:45.066
I didn't know if you
were dying or paralyzed.

27:45.091 --> 27:47.238
I just came as fast as I could.

28:09.352 --> 28:12.446
Oh, Mr. Wheeler, I'm sorry.

28:13.835 --> 28:15.734
I'll give you some time.

28:18.539 --> 28:20.491
Why did he do it?

28:23.087 --> 28:27.998
Even if he was having trouble, why?

28:29.094 --> 28:30.835
I don't know.

28:38.062 --> 28:39.919
Did you ever see Jason do that trick

28:39.944 --> 28:42.208
where you'd pull a card out of the deck

28:42.233 --> 28:44.140
and it turns out it's in his pocket?

28:44.392 --> 28:46.647
Yeah. When he was a kid.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.818
Yeah. I saw him do it once

28:49.843 --> 28:52.731
up on the pediatric oncology ward.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.122
I guess he used to go up
there a couple times a week

28:55.147 --> 28:56.694
to do magic for the kids.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.196
And oh, man, did they love it.

29:00.485 --> 29:02.974
He did this thing where he would
pull a lemon out of his ear,

29:02.999 --> 29:04.521
and then out of one of the kids' ears,

29:04.546 --> 29:05.803
and then out of another,

29:05.914 --> 29:09.206
and they'd be rolling on the ground.

29:09.912 --> 29:13.709
Just ten minutes in their day
where they didn't have to think

29:13.734 --> 29:16.201
about whatever terrible
illness they had.

29:20.104 --> 29:21.803
I didn't know your son very well.

29:21.828 --> 29:24.471
And I've seen a lot of
doctors come through here.

29:25.324 --> 29:27.141
He would've been a good one.

29:31.318 --> 29:34.385
Thank you.

29:35.717 --> 29:37.617
Yeah.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.523
- We had no idea.
- It seems like he's been

29:50.548 --> 29:51.952
harboring thoughts and feelings

29:51.977 --> 29:53.610
that he wasn't comfortable expressing,

29:53.635 --> 29:56.078
and his body found a way
to express them for him.

29:56.305 --> 29:58.307
So he wasn't actually paralyzed?

29:58.332 --> 30:00.313
No. But he was
experiencing real symptoms.

30:00.338 --> 30:02.238
It's why we call it a
conversion disorder.

30:02.263 --> 30:05.266
It's the physical manifestation
of a psychological desire.

30:05.324 --> 30:07.844
Desire? Sounds like you're saying

30:07.868 --> 30:08.891
he wanted to be paralyzed.

30:08.916 --> 30:10.415
I'm saying he didn't want to move.

30:10.440 --> 30:11.812
And his subconscious decided

30:11.837 --> 30:13.736
that having a serious
medical condition might be

30:13.761 --> 30:16.262
- a good way to accomplish that.
- That sounds crazy.

30:16.294 --> 30:19.336
Crazy, no. Complicated, sure.

30:19.361 --> 30:21.695
But if you think about it as a whole,

30:21.720 --> 30:23.787
an understandable response
to what must have seemed

30:23.812 --> 30:25.378
like an impossible situation.

30:25.403 --> 30:28.164
I mean, having to leave somebody
that he couldn't tell you about,

30:28.189 --> 30:30.969
somebody for whom he had
very strong feelings.

30:31.252 --> 30:32.984
But if he was so upset,

30:33.009 --> 30:34.969
why didn't he seem to care
about being paralyzed?

30:34.994 --> 30:37.867
Compartmentalization is
just part of the condition.

30:38.014 --> 30:39.625
But trust me: your son cares.

30:39.650 --> 30:41.483
I mean, he cares a great deal.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.256
Just to be safe, we'd
like to observe him

30:43.281 --> 30:44.203
in the hospital overnight.

30:44.228 --> 30:47.129
Then probably a good
idea for the three of you

30:47.154 --> 30:48.273
to sit down and have a talk.

30:48.299 --> 30:49.656
They're getting a room for him upstairs.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.013
I'll let you know when it's ready.

30:51.085 --> 30:52.851
Thank you.

30:59.436 --> 31:00.836
Damn.

31:00.861 --> 31:02.804
The funny thing about feelings:

31:03.029 --> 31:05.663
you know, we think that if we
push them down hard enough,

31:05.688 --> 31:07.033
that they'll disappear.

31:07.980 --> 31:10.067
Never quite works out that way.

31:13.301 --> 31:15.165
I could've killed him.

31:16.055 --> 31:17.755
Yeah, well, you didn't.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.384
Cheryl?

31:38.028 --> 31:40.456
Cheryl, I was watching him every second,

31:40.920 --> 31:42.586
and then Ben called about this thing,

31:42.611 --> 31:44.085
and I had to look it up on my phone.

31:44.110 --> 31:47.399
And I know you never take your
eyes off the kids for a minute,

31:47.424 --> 31:48.571
and I'm always working,

31:48.596 --> 31:51.076
and you're a far better
parent than I am.

31:52.766 --> 31:54.688
I'm sorry.

32:02.018 --> 32:04.173
I don't know what else to tell you.

32:06.389 --> 32:08.698
I'm just so sorry.

32:09.829 --> 32:11.930
I'm tagging you out.

32:12.299 --> 32:15.367
There's a couch in the
lounge that's free.

32:15.416 --> 32:17.082
I'll grab you in 20.

32:17.177 --> 32:18.722
Thanks.

32:19.536 --> 32:21.510
There's something else I have to do.

32:40.878 --> 32:42.502
Hey.

32:42.527 --> 32:43.760
Hey.

32:46.691 --> 32:49.525
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier,

32:49.550 --> 32:50.721
going off on you like that.

32:50.746 --> 32:52.190
- Okay.
- But...

32:52.215 --> 32:53.889
But what?

32:55.800 --> 32:58.838
I know that you blame
me for the miscarriage.

32:58.863 --> 33:00.796
- April...
- No. Admit it.

33:00.871 --> 33:03.073
No matter how many times you're told

33:03.098 --> 33:05.126
that my working had
nothing to do with it,

33:05.151 --> 33:09.238
you just... you won't let it go.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.722
But it's bigger than that.

33:13.021 --> 33:15.744
You would've had me
quit my job a year ago,

33:15.769 --> 33:17.621
before I was even pregnant.

33:19.038 --> 33:22.472
You want a different kind of woman.

33:22.497 --> 33:23.585
I want you.

33:23.968 --> 33:25.588
I love you.

33:27.094 --> 33:30.092
I just imagined a
different kind of life.

33:39.545 --> 33:41.073
I know.

34:05.263 --> 34:07.998
I hope you find everything you want.

34:09.829 --> 34:13.303
You too. You too.

34:35.733 --> 34:37.791
Amazing what the mind can do, isn't it?

34:37.815 --> 34:41.163
Mm. Keeps me employed. That's for sure.

34:44.186 --> 34:46.168
You know, Wheeler...

34:46.943 --> 34:49.770
Maybe what happened wasn't my fault,

34:49.795 --> 34:53.091
but I didn't help.

34:53.614 --> 34:55.427
Hey, join the club.

34:55.452 --> 34:57.974
Look, not for nothing,
helping people is just...

34:57.999 --> 35:00.182
Just about the hardest job there is.

35:02.388 --> 35:08.732
You've been doing it... what?
25, 30... several years?

35:10.762 --> 35:13.044
What... what's the secret?

35:13.069 --> 35:14.162
Well, I'm still looking for that,

35:14.187 --> 35:16.931
but if I had to guess,
I'd say it had something to do

35:16.956 --> 35:18.373
with, you know, just keep showing up,

35:18.398 --> 35:20.536
keep doing your job,
put one foot in front of the other,

35:20.693 --> 35:23.099
'cause when you start to
get all tangled up in here,

35:23.124 --> 35:26.489
you know, that's when, I mean,
it can just paralyze you.

35:29.821 --> 35:31.364
Yeah.

35:32.394 --> 35:36.974
Still, it's gonna be a while
before I can sleep again.

35:36.999 --> 35:38.679
Dr. Halstead?

35:40.718 --> 35:42.481
I think we're lucky to have you here.

35:42.736 --> 35:44.482
You keep up the good work.

35:46.331 --> 35:48.398
Hey. I think he's waking up.

35:49.698 --> 35:51.942
- Hey, buddy.
- Dustin!

35:51.967 --> 35:54.928
He's trying to breath. Hang on, Dustin.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.221
We're gonna take this tube out, okay?

35:56.246 --> 35:57.990
Hang in there, buddy.

35:58.015 --> 35:59.651
We're right here, buddy, okay?

35:59.676 --> 36:01.177
We'll take this out.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.510
- Dustin?
- Can you hear us, buddy? Hey.

36:03.535 --> 36:04.417
There we go.

36:04.442 --> 36:07.253
- All right, sweetheart.
- Dustin!

36:07.493 --> 36:10.072
Bilateral breath sounds are present.

36:12.477 --> 36:14.377
Pupils are equal and reactive to light.

36:14.402 --> 36:16.052
Hey, Dustin, if you can hear me,

36:16.077 --> 36:17.772
can you tell me who this is?

36:17.957 --> 36:19.357
Mom?

36:19.482 --> 36:21.022
Oh, my God.

36:21.047 --> 36:23.724
Let's d/c the lung lavage,
but keep the peritoneal going

36:23.749 --> 36:26.226
- until he's 98 degrees, okay?
- Got it.

36:26.673 --> 36:28.971
We're gonna need to
observe him for a few days,

36:28.996 --> 36:31.064
but this is a very good sign.

36:31.225 --> 36:33.147
Dr. Manning?

36:33.172 --> 36:34.569
Yes?

36:35.570 --> 36:39.672
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

36:39.697 --> 36:43.373
Thank you. Thank you for
everything that you've done.

36:46.476 --> 36:49.684
I'm just happy we were
able to save your boy.

37:38.855 --> 37:40.175
How about that?

37:40.200 --> 37:42.511
I guess every now and then we get lucky.

37:43.023 --> 37:44.596
Yeah.

37:46.253 --> 37:48.053
How'd it go with Dr. Richardson?

37:48.078 --> 37:49.480
She stay busy?

37:49.505 --> 37:51.324
Uh, nobody showed.

37:51.615 --> 37:54.016
- Nobody?
- Yeah, but that's... you know,

37:54.041 --> 37:55.152
it takes time.

37:55.177 --> 37:58.503
Trust me.
People are dealing in their own way.

37:59.203 --> 38:00.997
When I took this job, Daniel,

38:01.022 --> 38:03.089
I wanted to create an environment

38:03.114 --> 38:05.370
where we would never lose someone.

38:05.395 --> 38:07.910
Everyone would look out for each other.

38:08.013 --> 38:09.621
I thought I did.

38:10.065 --> 38:12.480
But then today I found out

38:12.505 --> 38:16.503
there was a very troubled
young man in our midst,

38:17.246 --> 38:20.206
and not a single person knew him.

38:21.144 --> 38:22.245
I failed.

38:22.270 --> 38:23.699
- Sharon, come on.
- No, no.

38:23.724 --> 38:26.933
You... you got to wonder
about all the ones

38:26.958 --> 38:29.113
who don't jump off the ledge...

38:29.138 --> 38:31.699
What's going through their heads,

38:31.724 --> 38:34.396
how this job is affecting them.

38:37.517 --> 38:42.660
I worry about these people, Daniel.

38:45.069 --> 38:46.238
I worry about them.

38:46.263 --> 38:48.232
I know you do. I know you do.

38:48.257 --> 38:50.277
I wish I could protect them.

39:22.148 --> 39:23.945
He's right here, Ethan.

39:50.031 --> 39:51.664
I'm so sorry.

40:27.637 --> 40:29.937
They won't need me in the ED tomorrow,

40:29.962 --> 40:31.513
so I'll be back on your service.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.181
Thank you.

40:33.206 --> 40:35.517
Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.

40:45.890 --> 40:48.054
Everybody comes to you, don't they?

40:48.079 --> 40:49.875
With all their pain?

40:52.236 --> 40:54.452
And you just have to absorb it.

41:00.747 --> 41:02.832
How are you doing today?

41:10.868 --> 41:15.390
It was awful. It's just awful.
