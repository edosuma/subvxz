Hey.

00:05.135 --> 00:07.355
Who are you faxing so early
in the morning?

00:07.398 --> 00:08.791
Oh, um...

00:10.184 --> 00:11.794
Kinda hard to explain.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.665
I don't have a ton
of contact

00:13.709 --> 00:15.624
with the Scranton branch,

00:15.667 --> 00:16.712
but before I left,

00:16.755 --> 00:19.106
I took a box
of Dwight's stationery.

00:19.149 --> 00:22.805
So from time to time,
I send Dwight faxes.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.807

I'm here to tell you
that we are closing

01:41.188 --> 01:42.798
the Scranton branch.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.715
I don't understand.

01:46.758 --> 01:48.717
The board voted last night
to close your branch.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.155
On whom's authority?

01:52.199 --> 01:54.114
The board's.

Uh, you've been a big part
of this company.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.475
And the board asked me
to thank you

02:07.518 --> 02:09.999
for your years
of service.

02:10.042 --> 02:11.348
You're welcome.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.306
A small number of people
will be transferred

02:12.349 --> 02:13.742
to the Stamford branch,

02:13.785 --> 02:15.744
and the rest will be getting
severance packages.

02:17.615 --> 02:20.749
Am I a small number person
or a severance package person?

02:20.792 --> 02:22.011
Well, we haven't made

02:22.054 --> 02:26.450
final decisions
about personnel yet.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.669
But you're a severance
package person.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.108
Oh, my God.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.979
Oh, my God!

02:35.764 --> 02:36.939
I don't really get it.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.288
Because we are not doing that
bad

02:38.332 --> 02:39.768
All numbers are gonna come up

02:39.811 --> 02:41.291
It's not all
about numbers, Michael.

02:41.335 --> 02:42.771
Well--It's--it's about talent.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.947
Oh, you gotta--
Josh?

02:44.990 --> 02:46.514
Our CFO believes

02:46.557 --> 02:48.516
that Josh is going to play
an important role-- Josh.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.517
in our company's future.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.040
Oh, really?
What role is that?

02:51.083 --> 02:53.260
Yes, really. King of the stupid universe?

02:53.825 --> 02:56.176
It is an outrage.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.089
That's all.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.352
It's--

02:58.395 --> 03:02.182
They're making a huge,
huge mistake.

03:02.225 --> 03:05.054
Let's see Josh
replace these people.

03:05.097 --> 03:09.145
Let's see Josh
find another Stanley.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.538
You think Stanleys
grow on trees?

03:10.581 --> 03:12.104
Well, they don't.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.541
There is no Stanley tree.

03:13.584 --> 03:18.633
Do you think the world
is crawling with Phyllises?

03:18.676 --> 03:20.809
Show me that farm.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.464
With Phyllises and Kevins
sprouting up

03:23.507 --> 03:25.901
all over the place,
ripe for the plucking.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.298
Show me that farm.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.431
Pictures.

03:34.475 --> 03:37.260
Memories.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.348
Look at that.

03:38.392 --> 03:39.784
They grow up so fast.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.615
Hey, stranger.
Don't say that.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.617
That just sounds weird.
Please.

03:46.661 --> 03:49.011
Sorry, I just feel like
we haven't talked in a while.

03:49.054 --> 03:51.840
Well, we have nothing
to talk about, Dwight.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.972
Just do your work.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.060
While you still can.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.628
When you become close
with someone,

03:57.672 --> 04:00.022
you develop a kind
of sixth sense.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.285
You can read their moods
like a book.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.287
Right now, the title
of Michael's book

04:04.331 --> 04:08.465
is Something Weird
Is Going On.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.380
Colon:

04:10.424 --> 04:12.426
What Did Jan Say?

04:14.515 --> 04:17.257
The Michael Scott Story.

04:17.300 --> 04:19.215
By Michael Scott.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.956
With Dwight Schrute.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.132
Hey, um, did you hear
about your friends

04:23.175 --> 04:24.525
in Pennsylvania?

04:24.568 --> 04:26.396
Rumor has it that
the Scranton branch is "gklch."

04:26.440 --> 04:28.659
Really?

04:28.703 --> 04:29.704
Wow, that's too bad.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.401
Um...

04:31.445 --> 04:32.402
Sorry.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.796
Scranton branch is closing?

04:34.839 --> 04:37.015
In your face.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.322
Well, I work here now.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.193
Mmmm! Sucka.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.550
Are you okay?
D--Yeah.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.421
Great, amazing.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.380
Best physical condition
of my life.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.164
What did Jan want?

04:55.207 --> 04:57.819
Nothing.
Just checking in.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.301
I can't tell you, so.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.563
What can't you tell me?

05:02.606 --> 05:04.869
Nothing.
Pam.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.218
What difference does it make?

05:06.262 --> 05:07.394
We'll all be gone
in a few weeks anyway.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.917
What?
What?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.397
You just said
that we're gonna be gone--

05:10.440 --> 05:11.354
Do I have any messages?

05:11.398 --> 05:12.834
Michael, what's going on?

05:12.964 --> 05:14.923
Okay.
Okay.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.359
Listen up, everybody.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.318
I have some news.

05:20.363 --> 05:23.061
We are screwed.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.889
Dunder-Mifflin Scranton
is being shut down.

05:24.933 --> 05:27.065
Michael, uh...

05:27.109 --> 05:28.197
We shouldn't be talking
about this

05:28.240 --> 05:29.981
until all the decisions
have been made.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.855
You knew about this
all along, didn't you?

05:33.898 --> 05:37.032
Jan told me just a few minutes
before she told you.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.555
Traitor.

05:38.599 --> 05:39.861
You are a traitor.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.384
What about us, Michael?
Do we still have jobs?

05:41.428 --> 05:42.385
I don't know.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.345
Probably not.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.521
This is the worst.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.571
It makes perfect sense
that it would happen today

05:54.615 --> 05:57.661
because I just received this
in the mail.

05:57.705 --> 05:58.793
1,000 business cards

05:58.836 --> 06:01.404
with this address
and phone number.

06:01.448 --> 06:04.407
I don't want to blame anyone
in particular.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.409
I think everyone's to blame.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.369
If I get to stay
and Ryan is laid off,

06:09.412 --> 06:11.501
I will kill myself.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.764
Like Romeo and Juliet.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.070
The Claire Danes one.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.854
♪ Stamford Connecticut

06:18.508 --> 06:20.380
♪ Stamford Connecticut

06:20.597 --> 06:22.425
I worked in Scranton for really
long time.

06:22.469 --> 06:27.387
And its gonna be weird that its
all disappearing.

06:27.430 --> 06:31.782
I mean I was knowing that branch
will shutdown someday and just
figured that would be Micheal

06:31.826 --> 06:34.263
sold the building for some magic
beans.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.312
I couldn't be happier.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.271
I'm gonna take the severance
and retire.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.577
My wife and I are
gonna travel.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.580
I really couldn't be happier.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.060
Its a blessing in the disguise

06:49.452 --> 06:51.802
Actually not even in
disguise.

06:51.846 --> 06:55.806
Sometimes at home I answer the
phone Dunder-Mifflin this is
pam.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.461
So maybe that will stop
now.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.072
What does that mean?

07:01.116 --> 07:04.989
Well, some of us are fired. And
a few are going to cinedicate.

07:05.033 --> 07:07.035
I no further gonna work here
without pam.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.996
You know that Cinderella song

07:12.040 --> 07:14.042
You don'’t know what you got till
its gone.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.437
It pretty much says it better
than how I know.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.439
I have said in words.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.446
Hey, Mike.Darrel.

07:26.489 --> 07:27.490
Noble Darrel.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.668
Look, I heard
about the office.
Oh.

07:31.712 --> 07:32.669
Tough break.
I know.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.062
I know.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.193
Well, I'll land
on my feet.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.847
Yeah.
Don't worry about me.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.283
I wasn't.

07:38.327 --> 07:39.633
So you'll be okay too.

07:39.676 --> 07:42.026
You're a warrior.
You're smart, capable.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.898
You'll find something else,
and--

07:43.941 --> 07:46.770
Actually, Bob Vance bought out
the warehouse.

07:46.814 --> 07:47.945
So he's keeping on
the whole crew.

07:47.989 --> 07:48.990
So we're good.

07:51.427 --> 07:52.646
Awesome.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.648
This is my house.

07:54.691 --> 07:57.302
The CFO's taking away my house
and giving it to Josh.

07:57.346 --> 08:01.785
And Josh is giving the garage
to Bob Vance.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.006
Pah.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.443
All right, listen up.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.792
Some of you may have heard

08:08.836 --> 08:11.491
some rumors
about the branch closing.

08:11.534 --> 08:12.883
But I am not

08:12.927 --> 08:14.842
going to take this
lying down.

08:14.885 --> 08:15.930
I have a plan,

08:15.973 --> 08:17.322
and I am going
to save our jobs.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.628
So just hang in there.
Let's go.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.238
Yes!

08:20.282 --> 08:21.501
Oh, good.
You're bringing Dwight.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.372
Yes.
This might get ugly.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.461
I'm gonna need backup.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.245
What's the plan?

08:27.289 --> 08:28.290
Go to New York.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.683
Confront the CFO.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.641
Show him he's making a mistake.
Save the branch.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.382
Can I drive?
No way.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.383
Shotgun!

08:34.426 --> 08:35.776
No, there's no one else.

08:35.819 --> 08:36.820
Still.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.564
Thank you very much.
Okay.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.523
Secretary says Wallace
is away for the day--
Agh.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.263
and won't be coming back
into the office.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.787
Okay, okay.
Um--

08:46.830 --> 08:48.092
But...

08:48.136 --> 08:49.441
do not worry.

08:49.485 --> 08:51.008
I have his home address...

08:51.052 --> 08:52.923
right here.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.272
Why?

08:54.316 --> 08:55.796
Christmas card list.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.232
You send him cards?

08:57.275 --> 08:58.450
You've never met him.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.539
Well, when I do,

08:59.582 --> 09:01.323
we'll have something
to talk about.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.674
Hey, do you have a second?

09:04.718 --> 09:06.502
Sure, what's up?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.286
I-I know it's not definite,
or whatever,

09:08.330 --> 09:10.593
but, uh, do you know
who's coming over here

09:10.637 --> 09:12.116
from Scranton?

09:12.160 --> 09:13.378
I honestly don't.
I don't know.

09:13.422 --> 09:14.684
Okay.

09:14.728 --> 09:17.252
So is it, like, sales
or...accountants or--

09:17.295 --> 09:19.036
You know what, Jim?
I wouldn't worry about it.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.038
What does that mean?

09:21.082 --> 09:22.649
Hi. Jan, hey.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.128
Oh, good, you're both here.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.652
Ready to talk logistics?

09:27.305 --> 09:30.265
I just feel like it could have
been something special

09:30.308 --> 09:32.484
if we could have kept
working together.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.877
But...

09:33.921 --> 09:34.922
I'm gonna go
someplace else,

09:34.965 --> 09:37.838
and you're gonna go
someplace else.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.535
It just doesn't make sense.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.103
This kind of worked out
perfectly for me.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.800
I got some good experience.

09:43.844 --> 09:47.369
Um, Michael's gonna write me
a great recommendation.

09:47.412 --> 09:51.286
And as far as
me and Kelly goes...

09:51.329 --> 09:53.418
I think it's for the best.

09:53.636 --> 09:54.724
Okay.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.726
This is it.

09:56.770 --> 09:59.207
This is exactly
what Michael Moore does.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.688
Famous documentarian.

10:01.731 --> 10:04.168
He goes up to people
with a camera,

10:04.212 --> 10:05.387
and he's like,

10:05.430 --> 10:06.736
"Why did you do this?

10:06.780 --> 10:07.824
"Why did you pollute?

10:07.868 --> 10:10.044
You are bad.
You're a bad person."

10:10.087 --> 10:11.088
It's very dramatic.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.437
Although I can't say
I was a big fan

10:12.481 --> 10:14.222
of Bowling For Columbine.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.658
Because I thought it
was gonna be

10:15.702 --> 10:16.572
a bowling movie.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.400
Like Kingpin.

10:22.796 --> 10:25.537
And it wasn't.
It was something else.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.019
So.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.239
Josh will be running
what is now called

10:31.282 --> 10:32.762

10:32.806 --> 10:34.895
which is all the offices
north of Stamford.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.244
And Jim,
if you want the job,

10:36.287 --> 10:37.898
you'll be his number two.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.639
Wow. Uh, sure.
Absolutely.

10:39.682 --> 10:40.857
Awesome. 'Scuse me, Jan. I'm sorry.

at Staples.

Today.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.743
Mm-hmm.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.701
You leveraged your new position
with us

10:58.745 --> 10:59.615
into another offer?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.399
Damn it, Josh.

11:01.443 --> 11:05.055
This whole restructuring thing
was based around keeping you.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.404
I--

11:06.448 --> 11:08.015
I'm sorry, all right?
It's done.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.016
It's done.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.365
I gotta make some calls.

11:10.408 --> 11:11.888
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, Jim.

about Michael Scott.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.591
But he would never do that.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.073
So.

11:23.117 --> 11:23.770
Do you know
what you're gonna say

11:23.813 --> 11:25.162
when he shows up?

11:25.206 --> 11:26.511
I will improvise.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.687
I will speak
from the heart.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.123
No.
Bad idea.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.994
You need an attack plan.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.909
Here, I'll be him.
You be you.

and putting 15 people
out of work?

11:48.098 --> 11:50.231
Well, the branch is no longer
financially viable.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.841
It's simple dollars
and cents.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.061
Yes, but these

17:31.137 --> 17:33.052
and told me
that you cared about me.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.445
Oh, right. Okay.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.056

That's good.

I'd have to learn everything
all over again.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.167
So...

18:45.211 --> 18:47.213
there are reasons to stay.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.564
Hey, um...

18:50.607 --> 18:52.827
I think I am
gonna take that job.

18:52.870 --> 18:53.828
And...

18:53.871 --> 18:55.743
Scranton?

18:55.786 --> 18:57.092
It's not that bad.

18:57.136 --> 19:01.792
So if they offer you
a job there...

19:01.836 --> 19:02.967
I think you should take it.

19:04.534 --> 19:05.709
Okay, yeah.
Maybe I will.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.450
Okay.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.017
Yeah, I'm--
I'm happy he said that.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.498
I mean, I don't think
he's into me or anything.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.195
But...

19:13.239 --> 19:15.719
I'm kind of into him.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.765
So...there you go.

19:24.511 --> 19:27.470
What are we still
doing here?

19:27.514 --> 19:30.212
It's over.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.344
Let's go home.

19:31.387 --> 19:32.997
Get the car.

19:37.045 --> 19:40.266
Ohhh, this was such
a stupid idea.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.312
This was so stupid.

19:43.356 --> 19:46.228
I'm such a stupid idiot.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.664
I let everybody down.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.405
Everybody hates me.

19:49.449 --> 19:53.017
I lost everybody's jobs.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.976
Nobody likes me anymore!

19:55.019 --> 19:55.977
Oh, my God!

19:56.020 --> 19:57.152
What?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.588
Stamford is closed!

19:58.632 --> 20:00.634
Michael, we're not closed.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.288
Stamford is closed!

20:02.331 --> 20:03.289
Stamford is closed!
We did it?

20:03.332 --> 20:05.204
We did it!
We did it!

20:05.247 --> 20:06.988
We did it!

20:07.031 --> 20:08.859
Yaaahhhh!
We did it!

20:10.992 --> 20:11.949
We did it!
Yeah!

20:11.993 --> 20:13.516
We did it!

20:13.560 --> 20:14.778
Yeah!
Right here, right here.

20:14.822 --> 20:17.607
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

20:17.651 --> 20:19.740
Ho, ho, ho, ho, hoooo!

20:19.783 --> 20:20.610
Yeah, baby!

20:20.654 --> 20:23.309
In your face!

20:23.352 --> 20:24.310
We did it.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.572
Oh, man.

20:25.615 --> 20:28.139
How did we do it?

20:28.183 --> 20:29.271
I don't know.
I have no idea.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.186
I don't understand.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.363
Well, for a minute there,
I saw myself

20:34.407 --> 20:36.278
selling my house,
moving to Costa Rica,

20:36.322 --> 20:38.280
learning how to surf.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.543
But Costa Rica
will still be there...

20:43.459 --> 20:44.895
when I'm 65.
