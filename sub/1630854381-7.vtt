19:11.442 --> 19:12.735
Now I have to do it
all for you."

19:12.735 --> 19:14.445
And then my mom
would come in and say,

19:14.445 --> 19:15.821
"Don't upset Roseanne --"

19:15.821 --> 19:18.240
I don't think you're
incompetent, Jackie,

19:18.240 --> 19:20.993
and I just got upset
because you were dismissing me.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.620
I only wanted to help.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.372
Well,
it's the way you helped.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.123
Roseanne never listened
to me.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.542
She never cared about
anything I had to say.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.087
Well, I care about
what you have to say,

19:31.087 --> 19:33.089
because I know
how that feels.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.966
The owners at Casita Bonita
would ignore me

19:35.966 --> 19:39.136
every time I tried
to suggest anything.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.014
I thought you would at least
appreciate my ideas.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.392
Oh, I do.
I do appreciate your ideas.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.812
You just have to express them
in a way that I can...

19:47.812 --> 19:49.063
pretend they're mine.

19:49.063 --> 19:50.231
That's all.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.360
Wow.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.237
Where do you come up
with stuff like that?

19:56.237 --> 19:57.571
Yeah. I don't know.
I-I --

19:57.571 --> 20:00.533
I don't even analyze it,
you know?

20:00.533 --> 20:03.452
You know, later on, we will
go grab a glass of wine,

20:03.452 --> 20:05.871
and I'll give you some other
stuff you're gonna come up with.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.457
Oh, you mean like ideas
I've already had?

20:08.457 --> 20:10.042
Still ahead of me.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.127
[ Chuckles ]

20:11.127 --> 20:12.837
You guys
work everything out?

20:12.837 --> 20:14.588
'Cause I was worried
about you.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.591
Aw, don't worry, Becky.
I started dinner.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.594
She thinks I'm her sister,
you think I'm your cook.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.722
Not just that.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.098
You're also the nice lady

20:24.098 --> 20:25.766
we're gonna dump our dad on
when he's old.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.143
Yeah.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.853
Which is...

20:28.853 --> 20:30.062
now.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.984
Well...

20:34.984 --> 20:35.985
I did it.

20:35.985 --> 20:36.944
Quit my job.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.029
Ooh.
Okay.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.781
Let's see
what I taught you.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.533
Dentist?
Check.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.326
Lady parts doctor?

20:44.326 --> 20:45.369
Check.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.580
Upstairs
and downstairs?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.622
Check, and grow up.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.501
I'm gonna be in my bed
for the next week.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.336
Please take
care of my children,

20:54.336 --> 20:56.630
or, you know, sell them
at a fair price.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.882
♪♪

21:01.010 --> 21:03.179
Why can't I be the manager?
'Cause I'm the manager.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.555
I don't need
another manager.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.850
But you're the owner.
So I-I should be the manager.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.518
I like being the manager.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.270
Yeah, but
if I'm the manager,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.647
it takes the pressure
off you being the manager.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.151
Mom, Mom, two more shots.
Mnh-mnh.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.195
She was out after
the first five "managers."

21:20.738 --> 21:22.865
Jackie: Oh, maybe
you could be co-manager.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.200
I'll allow it.
