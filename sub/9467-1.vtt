00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:10.877 --> 00:11.945
...a bit.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.914
Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr,

00:14.914 --> 00:17.250
The show that brings you

00:17.250 --> 00:20.353
As a vagina,

00:20.353 --> 00:23.289
...as told by blind drunk comedians.

00:23.289 --> 00:25.892
They'll be spewing up

00:25.892 --> 00:27.927
all over the bus shelter

00:27.927 --> 00:30.630
Tonight, Matthew,

00:30.630 --> 00:32.131
I, for one, am furious!

00:32.131 --> 00:33.233
(retches)

00:33.233 --> 00:37.036
This woman looks like Baby Spice.

00:37.036 --> 00:40.840
He was a maverick, a trailblazer,

00:40.840 --> 00:41.841
Fuck off.

00:53.653 --> 00:54.954
We'll begin by learning

00:54.954 --> 00:57.957
how Sir Walter Raleigh introduced

00:57.957 --> 01:01.094
But you'll notice the only thing

01:02.228 --> 01:06.032
After 3 1/2 pints of lager

01:06.032 --> 01:07.467
you can see why.

01:07.467 --> 01:10.703
What is better than booze?

01:10.703 --> 01:13.840
I'll tell you what.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.744
Here's the story about the guy who

01:18.445 --> 01:21.648
Sir Walter Raleigh

01:21.648 --> 01:25.452
He was not just an explorer,

01:25.452 --> 01:29.456
he was also a writer,

01:29.456 --> 01:32.625
He had the pen, he had the gun,

01:32.625 --> 01:35.228
He was a lonely man. He thought,

01:35.228 --> 01:37.630
And the woman he turned out to meet

01:37.630 --> 01:41.434
was none other than

01:41.434 --> 01:44.571
The Queen,

01:44.571 --> 01:46.239
and she'd come across a puddle.

01:46.239 --> 01:48.041
There was a huge puddle.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.909
She didn't know what to do about this

01:49.909 --> 01:52.645
until a man emerged

01:52.645 --> 01:55.615
Was it Jack the Ripper? No.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.585
This was Sir Walter Raleigh.

02:00.253 --> 02:03.256
And what did he have in his hand?

02:03.256 --> 02:04.491
He charged forward.

02:04.491 --> 02:10.029
"Stop, Queenie, do not put

02:10.029 --> 02:12.799
"I'm gonna put my coat down

02:12.799 --> 02:14.667
so you don't have to walk across."

02:14.667 --> 02:15.668
The Queen...

02:16.669 --> 02:19.439
...said, "That sounds

02:19.439 --> 02:21.875
And he went,

02:21.875 --> 02:24.677
"I've made the gesture.

02:24.677 --> 02:27.947
She went, "Put it down!"

02:32.051 --> 02:33.253
So, the coat was down,

02:33.253 --> 02:37.323
and the Queen's feet were dry

02:38.157 --> 02:39.893
And she turns around and says,

02:39.893 --> 02:44.030
"You are a man

02:44.030 --> 02:47.433
And he thought,

02:47.433 --> 02:51.037
"This may pay off in the long run.

02:51.037 --> 02:54.440
He thought,

02:55.174 --> 02:57.744
So Raleigh swaggered across

02:57.744 --> 03:02.048
headlong into this battle which was

03:03.716 --> 03:06.085
Raleigh heads back to England.

03:06.085 --> 03:10.557
He's a massive hero,

03:10.557 --> 03:13.593
And it's kind of at this point

03:13.593 --> 03:15.828
that there might be

03:15.828 --> 03:20.233
The foot starts to twitch.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.336
She then says, "First of all,

03:23.336 --> 03:25.638
for your valiant efforts abroad."

03:25.638 --> 03:30.343
And she goes, "I would like you,

03:30.343 --> 03:33.279
And then she pretends to chop

03:34.213 --> 03:37.650
And then she goes,

03:37.650 --> 03:41.454
the ability to colonise

03:41.454 --> 03:45.024
And he goes,

03:45.024 --> 03:47.527
She goes, "Exactly!"

03:47.527 --> 03:51.264
They hug in that awkward way that

03:51.264 --> 03:54.934
They pull away and they think

03:55.635 --> 04:00.506
And he says, "I've gotta do some

04:04.844 --> 04:07.413
She goes up to her bedroom

04:08.548 --> 04:10.583
(laughs)

04:11.651 --> 04:16.055
So, in 1585, Sir Walter Raleigh

04:16.055 --> 04:18.291
He was walking around.

04:18.291 --> 04:22.328
He comes across this group of natives

04:22.328 --> 04:25.765
He also noticed that there was smoke

04:25.765 --> 04:28.868
"What the hell's going on here?

04:28.868 --> 04:32.772
He sits down on the one spare stool,

04:34.707 --> 04:36.909
And a chap hands him a pipe.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.647
He starts to...

04:40.647 --> 04:43.916
And... "Ooh, it's nice, I like that."

04:46.719 --> 04:50.256
And he headed back home

04:50.256 --> 04:52.959
with his pockets

04:52.959 --> 04:56.829
a couple of Rizlas in the back,

04:56.829 --> 05:00.833
And he bursts through the door

05:00.833 --> 05:02.235
And Sir Walter Raleigh goes,

05:02.235 --> 05:05.371
"Tonight, Matthew,

05:05.371 --> 05:10.543
He floats across the room, ruff on,

05:10.543 --> 05:12.011
The Queen checks him out.

05:12.011 --> 05:15.448
The Queen slides off her fucking

05:15.448 --> 05:17.250
And Sir Walter Raleigh goes,

05:17.250 --> 05:21.854
"Queen, I've bought you things.

05:21.854 --> 05:25.692
"And a large Toblerone, cos they were

05:26.526 --> 05:30.830
The Queen goes, "I have no idea what

05:30.830 --> 05:35.735
Sir Walter Raleigh said, "Get ready

05:35.735 --> 05:38.638
and handed a potato to the Queen.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.708
The Queen held it and said,

05:43.242 --> 05:46.913
No, she didn't say that.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.015
"...I've never seen such a thing."

05:49.015 --> 05:52.085
The Queen,

05:52.085 --> 05:54.287
decided to organise a banquet

05:54.287 --> 05:59.625
whereby every course of the banquet

05:59.625 --> 06:02.028
So, the chefs don't know what to do,

06:02.028 --> 06:07.333
and they serve the greens and

06:07.333 --> 06:11.904
The banquet begins. The food

06:11.904 --> 06:13.239
(laughs)

06:13.239 --> 06:17.009
Then, at the end of the meal,

06:17.009 --> 06:18.845
Things start to get

06:18.845 --> 06:22.815
And the Queen is seen to retch.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.253
And suddenly, the Queen...

06:27.253 --> 06:29.255
(retches)

06:29.255 --> 06:31.023
The princess... (laughs)

06:31.023 --> 06:32.625
(retches)

06:32.625 --> 06:34.360
(heaves)

06:34.360 --> 06:36.429
Sick is everywhere.

06:37.630 --> 06:41.801
All and sundry are vomiting potato

06:41.801 --> 06:44.403
So, the whole potato thing

06:44.403 --> 06:47.473
isn't particularly brilliant

06:48.441 --> 06:52.311
So, in 1591,

06:52.311 --> 06:57.250
of marrying the Queen's lady in

06:58.951 --> 07:00.753
Oh, that's a bit too much vodka.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.423
The Queen, like, she was fucking

07:04.423 --> 07:09.228
She was like,

07:09.228 --> 07:13.065
in a lady that I considered

07:13.065 --> 07:15.034
"I, for one, am furious!"

07:15.034 --> 07:18.070
So, he has no standing in the court.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.773
He tried to make his way back up

07:20.773 --> 07:22.008
but that wouldn't happen.

07:25.444 --> 07:28.447
Sir Walter Raleigh doesn't know

07:28.447 --> 07:31.651
"I'll return to my pirating ways.

07:31.651 --> 07:35.054
Turns out, he quite likes what Spain

07:35.054 --> 07:38.157
Then, six years later,

07:38.157 --> 07:40.326
I don't know what happened

07:40.326 --> 07:43.162
Something happened between

07:43.162 --> 07:45.031
But she did die.

07:45.031 --> 07:48.634
Another man comes in.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.436
A king.

07:50.436 --> 07:54.407
So, James I, as we all knew,

07:54.407 --> 07:58.344
And that King was very pro-Spain.

07:58.344 --> 08:02.248
And then he decides

08:02.248 --> 08:05.051
must be cast asunder.

08:05.051 --> 08:08.721
However, Sir Walter Raleigh

08:10.256 --> 08:13.359
He returns time and again

08:13.359 --> 08:16.429
Catholic tat,

08:16.429 --> 08:19.232
Eventually, it wears a bit thin.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.235
King goes,

08:22.235 --> 08:25.238
for you to become

08:25.238 --> 08:27.807
"Your head has got to go."

08:32.044 --> 08:35.081
And so the date is set for

08:35.847 --> 08:39.051
It's 29th October 1618.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.953
So the executioner... OK.

08:41.988 --> 08:45.157
Wait. So the executioner....

08:45.157 --> 08:46.225
(laughs)

08:46.225 --> 08:49.395
So the executioner

08:49.395 --> 08:51.631
and Sir Walter Raleigh, he says,

08:51.631 --> 08:53.132
"To cut one's head off

08:53.132 --> 08:58.237
is to remove all

08:58.237 --> 09:03.643
"So cut swift, cut swift, my friend,

09:03.643 --> 09:06.112
The guy says,

09:06.112 --> 09:10.049
He says, "No. That's it.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.051
"Pretty sure that's what I said."

09:14.787 --> 09:16.355
(blade slices)

09:16.355 --> 09:18.324
Who gives a fuck

09:19.025 --> 09:20.793
(laughs)

09:22.228 --> 09:26.232
Imagine a banquet where every single

09:26.232 --> 09:29.468
Or if you work at JD Sports,

09:29.468 --> 09:31.304
That's all we have time for

09:31.304 --> 09:33.806
See you on the other side

09:33.806 --> 09:35.875
"At first,

09:35.875 --> 09:38.110
"That's quite intense."

09:38.110 --> 09:39.946
It's fucking hell for leather.

09:42.014 --> 09:42.214
.

09:44.717 --> 09:44.917
.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.354
Welcome back to Drunk History,

09:48.354 --> 09:49.889
to find a sober comedian

09:49.889 --> 09:53.559
as you are someone who knows who

09:56.095 --> 10:00.132
Now gather round, children, it's

10:00.132 --> 10:01.400
But be warned, parents,

10:01.400 --> 10:04.904
it might be a tiny bit more swearier

10:04.904 --> 10:06.005
(laughs)

10:06.005 --> 10:09.041
Big Tom Davis had nine pints

10:09.041 --> 10:10.609
whilst telling us about it.

10:11.243 --> 10:15.147
I'm gonna tell you a story

10:15.915 --> 10:18.084
Robert of Locksley,

10:18.084 --> 10:20.953
but you might better know him

10:22.989 --> 10:26.192
I'm talking about way back,

10:26.192 --> 10:28.527
That's when Robin

10:28.527 --> 10:30.730
He was like an earl,

10:30.730 --> 10:32.932
but he was also

10:32.932 --> 10:35.835
All the birds would love him.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.770
He was an olden day David Beckham.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.706
Men wanted to be him,

10:40.706 --> 10:41.974
That was Robin Hood.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.275
Basically, on a Friday,

10:43.275 --> 10:45.678
they'd all gather down a pub

10:45.678 --> 10:49.215
which was named after Robin Hood.

10:49.215 --> 10:54.186
Robin just bowls in and goes,

10:54.186 --> 10:57.323
"Everybody in this place

10:57.323 --> 10:58.724
"And that mead's on me."

10:58.724 --> 11:00.993
Everyone in the place

11:00.993 --> 11:03.696
"He's always doing

11:03.696 --> 11:06.465
On the other side of the bar

11:06.465 --> 11:08.734
The Sheriff of Nottingham

11:08.734 --> 11:11.470
He was basically like

11:11.470 --> 11:13.072
He's collecting taxes.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.574
He doesn't like Robin Hood.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.109
He's not even Robin Hood yet.

11:17.109 --> 11:20.513
He's just a bloke in a bar

11:20.513 --> 11:26.519
Now, this prick, he's like...

11:26.519 --> 11:29.955
"That fucking snide.

11:29.955 --> 11:32.391
He doesn't say that.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.360
Someone next to him goes,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.128
"Nothing."

11:36.128 --> 11:37.730
"No." (grumbles)

11:37.730 --> 11:42.168
This was very, very, very important

11:42.168 --> 11:44.670
Robin Hood,

11:44.670 --> 11:47.306
Sheriff of Nottingham,

11:47.306 --> 11:48.974
(chuckles) Yeah!

11:54.113 --> 11:58.517
So, Locksley is out hunting one day.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.653
which is his favourite place

12:00.653 --> 12:03.255
All of a sudden,

12:04.523 --> 12:06.725
I mean, a lovely looking bird.

12:07.927 --> 12:12.364
This woman looks like Baby Spice.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.799
And she's from good stock.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.404
Her dad is like the earl of Fitzwater

12:18.404 --> 12:19.672
She's hunting as well.

12:19.672 --> 12:23.709
Anyway, Robin is like,

12:23.709 --> 12:25.911
She bowls over and she's like,

12:25.911 --> 12:29.515
"Oh, did you get that venison

12:29.515 --> 12:34.520
And Robin is like, "Hey, erm, yeah,

12:34.520 --> 12:38.524
"My name is Robin of Locksley.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.126
This woman is like,

12:40.126 --> 12:42.995
"Oh, I've never heard of you before

12:42.995 --> 12:44.563
"My name's Maid Marian."

12:44.563 --> 12:48.067
Anyway, they've got, like,

12:48.067 --> 12:49.835
She's like, "Oh, God,

12:49.835 --> 12:53.639
I can't believe we've got so much

12:53.639 --> 12:58.711
And he says, like, "Oh, man,

12:58.711 --> 13:01.514
"But now I actually think

13:01.514 --> 13:05.718
and maybe I love you.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.953
And Marian, in her head,

13:07.953 --> 13:10.256
"That's a helluva gesture.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.359
But she knows for a fact

13:13.359 --> 13:16.929
So Marian turns and goes, "Of course

13:16.929 --> 13:20.232
So, she jumps on her horse,

13:20.232 --> 13:23.068
And Robin's only real confidant

13:23.068 --> 13:27.706
So, he says to Jeff, "Hey, Jeff,

13:27.706 --> 13:30.042
"I never thought

13:30.042 --> 13:33.112
"Ride me back as quick as you can

13:33.112 --> 13:35.414
And Jeff's like,

13:35.414 --> 13:38.884
for the fucking last ten hours.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.520
Jeff doesn't like Robin,

13:41.520 --> 13:44.590
That's one of the things you've

13:44.590 --> 13:49.094
Anyway, he jumped on the back of Jeff

13:50.129 --> 13:53.999
And let me tell ya, this is where

13:54.733 --> 13:57.770
He rocks up, all of his shit's

13:57.770 --> 13:59.104
The whole lot, everything.

13:59.104 --> 14:02.241
All his fucking nice clothes,

14:02.241 --> 14:05.411
all of his candles...

14:05.411 --> 14:08.113
Jeff's like,

14:08.113 --> 14:11.784
He's like, "Jeff, always remain

14:11.784 --> 14:13.485
Jeff's like, "Hold up for a second."

14:13.485 --> 14:15.354
"Your shit's all over

14:15.354 --> 14:19.124
"What have we got to be positive

14:19.124 --> 14:21.894
Anyway, who appears but

14:23.028 --> 14:25.431
"Hey, man, what the hell's going on?"

14:25.431 --> 14:28.801
The Sheriff of Nottingham is like,

14:28.801 --> 14:32.605
"You've not paid your friggin'

14:32.605 --> 14:35.774
Locksley is like, "Hey, wait there

14:35.774 --> 14:38.344
"Listen, I paid my taxes."

14:38.344 --> 14:40.846
This man was taking the piss

14:40.846 --> 14:43.716
It was literally coming out

14:43.716 --> 14:46.385
So, Locksley is fucked.

14:46.385 --> 14:50.155
But Robin is Robin.

14:50.155 --> 14:55.728
"You can throw out my shit,

14:55.728 --> 15:00.199
"And I will bring the vengeance

15:00.199 --> 15:03.135
Jeff's like, "That's a good idea,

15:03.135 --> 15:05.404
So Robin goes off

15:05.404 --> 15:07.806
He's gone from being an earl

15:07.806 --> 15:10.643
to a muppet with nothing.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.045
He does the only good thing

15:13.045 --> 15:17.516
He writes Marian a letter

15:17.516 --> 15:18.917
"Dear Marian,

15:18.917 --> 15:22.087
I wanted to make love to your pussy

15:22.087 --> 15:27.126
but we can't be together

15:27.126 --> 15:29.995
So, Marian gets the letter

15:29.995 --> 15:32.798
"I thought we was in love,

15:32.798 --> 15:35.267
But somewhere in her heart, right?

15:35.267 --> 15:39.772
She knew that Robin

15:39.772 --> 15:43.208
Meanwhile, in Sherwood Forest

15:43.208 --> 15:46.945
"This whole place is beautiful, man."

15:46.945 --> 15:49.748
Jeff's like,

15:50.716 --> 15:53.585
All of a sudden, this fucking lump

15:53.585 --> 15:57.823
"Listen, my name's John.

15:57.823 --> 16:01.794
And Jeff's thinking, "Fucking knock

16:01.794 --> 16:07.032
Now, Robin has learnt how to use your

16:07.032 --> 16:10.269
So, when John goes for him,

16:10.269 --> 16:11.970
One to the chest, one to the face.

16:11.970 --> 16:14.173
There's nothing worse

16:14.173 --> 16:17.943
And then Robin is like,

16:17.943 --> 16:20.946
"But you asked for a fight,

16:20.946 --> 16:24.383
"What did you say your name was?"

16:24.383 --> 16:26.652
He says,

16:26.652 --> 16:29.188
He said,

16:29.188 --> 16:32.024
He's like, "It's ironic."

16:32.024 --> 16:34.993
He never likes it, if I'm completely

16:34.993 --> 16:36.695
John stands there and goes,

16:36.695 --> 16:41.033
"You know what, come and have a fire

16:41.033 --> 16:45.003
Robin settles in with the gang.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.706
there's a fella called Friar Tuck,

16:47.706 --> 16:50.008
All of a sudden,

16:50.008 --> 16:53.245
"Listen. Listen, guys, I got a plan."

16:53.245 --> 16:57.516
"We're gonna rob from the rich

16:57.516 --> 17:01.320
It's a beautiful thing,

17:01.320 --> 17:03.255
But while all this is going on,

17:03.255 --> 17:07.726
Marian can't stop thinking about

17:07.726 --> 17:12.263
So, Marian basically gets herself

17:12.263 --> 17:16.268
She goes out to Sherwood Forest

17:16.268 --> 17:20.172
The trouble is, Robin does

17:20.172 --> 17:23.976
Now, Robin sees... From Robin's eyes,

17:23.976 --> 17:26.345
Robin's like, "Who's this?

17:26.345 --> 17:31.116
Basically, he jumps out of this bush.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.051
And she puts on a geezer's voice.

17:33.051 --> 17:39.358
"I'm a knight, and I'm a knight

17:39.358 --> 17:41.126
She was up for it.

17:41.126 --> 17:44.430
And he says,

17:44.430 --> 17:46.832
"For me, you're just easy pickings."

17:46.832 --> 17:49.067
Neither of them even know

17:49.067 --> 17:50.969
That's the fucking sorrow in it all.

17:50.969 --> 17:54.773
And they go at it. I mean,

17:56.708 --> 18:00.412
So they're just like fucking smashing

18:00.412 --> 18:03.115
And then Robin, like,

18:03.115 --> 18:04.850
It's like Bruce Lee shit, man.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.385
And he takes her out, bang.

18:06.385 --> 18:09.721
He pulls the sword up

18:09.721 --> 18:11.190
and he looks into the eyes

18:11.190 --> 18:13.692
of the person he loves

18:14.693 --> 18:17.429
She says, "It's me! You beat Marian."

18:18.597 --> 18:21.567
"Marian of Maid. Maid Marian."

18:21.567 --> 18:25.904
And he looks her in the eye,

18:25.904 --> 18:28.807
you're the woman I wanted to be with

18:29.441 --> 18:32.010
She's like, "What are you doing

18:32.010 --> 18:33.679
"What are you doing out here, Robin?"

18:34.813 --> 18:38.050
He said,

18:38.050 --> 18:41.854
"Who I am is the woods and the trees

18:41.854 --> 18:44.723
She's a bit like,

18:44.723 --> 18:46.592
She's like, "Let me join you."

18:46.592 --> 18:49.428
"Let me be one of you

18:49.428 --> 18:52.464
He's like, "I can't let you

18:52.464 --> 18:56.468
She's like, "If I'm not with you,

18:56.468 --> 19:00.205
"So, put that knife through my gullet

19:00.205 --> 19:03.475
Robin can't kill her, so he pulls

19:03.475 --> 19:05.344
"I'll let you be one of us."

19:05.344 --> 19:08.647
"But so nobody else

19:08.647 --> 19:13.118
Cos he's a bit self-conscious.

19:13.118 --> 19:16.188
Jeff's in the background, thinking,

19:16.188 --> 19:20.959
And then Friar Tuck pipes up.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.828
So, yeah,

19:22.828 --> 19:25.397
And at the end of it,

19:25.397 --> 19:30.636
"You know, I used to have

19:30.636 --> 19:34.239
"I used to think that's what made me

19:34.239 --> 19:38.710
"But all in the end I really needed

19:38.710 --> 19:42.714
Marian turns around and says,

19:44.716 --> 19:48.854
So that, my friends, is the story

19:48.854 --> 19:51.123
the best ever working class

19:51.123 --> 19:54.159
It's better than Romeo and Juliet

19:54.159 --> 19:59.731
If you wanna be with someone,

19:59.731 --> 20:01.934
Because they didn't.

20:01.934 --> 20:06.471
And they made love in a beautiful

20:11.109 --> 20:14.746
I had a green hood once. Thankfully,

20:17.215 --> 20:19.051
Well, that's the end

20:19.051 --> 20:22.254
Our comedians are off to soak up

20:22.254 --> 20:24.489
and possibly a cat. Goodnight.

21:22.948 --> 21:23.048
.
