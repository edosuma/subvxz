00:02.003 --> 00:03.618
Previously on Lost:

00:03.713 --> 00:06.750
I'm here to tell you the island
won't let you come alone.

00:06.841 --> 00:09.002
All of you have to go back.

00:09.093 --> 00:13.302
Is that what this is about?
This is insane. You guys are crazy.

00:13.389 --> 00:15.175
- Kate...
- Jack! Don't...

00:15.266 --> 00:18.133
- Where are you going?
- I don't want any part of this.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.216
lt's Jin!

00:25.401 --> 00:29.235
- How do you know he's alive?!
- There's someone...

00:30.072 --> 00:33.200
- ...someone here in Los Angeles.
- Someone? Who?

00:33.284 --> 00:36.447
The person that's gonna show us
how to get back to the island.

01:21.958 --> 01:25.291
Help! Anyone!

01:29.340 --> 01:31.331
Help!

01:32.677 --> 01:34.087
Help! Jack!

01:41.811 --> 01:44.018
Help! Anyone!

01:50.027 --> 01:51.312
Help!

01:58.995 --> 01:59.984
Help!

02:22.935 --> 02:23.970
It's OK.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.269
- It's OK. Just relax.
- Oh, God!

02:30.318 --> 02:33.606
- Oh, my God.
- We can stand.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.402
Oh, my God.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.905
It really happened.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.081
Kate?

03:10.107 --> 03:13.019
Kate, can you hear me?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.149
- Jack?
- Are you OK?

03:25.790 --> 03:29.533
- Are we...?
- Yeah. We're back.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.381
What happened?

03:59.198 --> 04:01.314
I thought I said all of them.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.493
This is all I could get on short notice.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.196
I guess it'll have to do for now.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.162
All right. Let's get started.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.552
Shall we?

05:33.918 --> 05:35.454
What is this place?

05:35.920 --> 05:40.004
The Dharma Initiative called it
The Lamp Post.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.675
This is how they found the island.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.621
Did you know about this place?

06:15.751 --> 06:18.117
No. No, I didn't.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.459
- Is he telling the truth?
- Probably not.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.557
Here we go.

06:31.559 --> 06:35.518
All right. I apologize
if this is confusing.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.767
But let's pay attention, yes?

06:41.318 --> 06:45.732
The room we're standing in
was constructed years ago

06:45.823 --> 06:49.156
over a unique pocket
of electromagnetic energy.

06:49.243 --> 06:53.407
That energy connects to
similar pockets all over the world.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.581
The people who built this room, however,
were only interested in one.

06:57.668 --> 07:01.331
- The island.
- Yes, the island.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.334
They'd gathered proof that it existed,

07:04.425 --> 07:10.170
they knew it was out there somewhere,
but they just couldn't find it.

07:11.515 --> 07:15.929
Then a very clever fellow
built this pendulum

07:16.020 --> 07:18.056
on the theoretical notion

07:18.147 --> 07:22.641
that they should stop looking for
where the island was supposed to be,

07:22.735 --> 07:26.853
and start looking for
where it was going to be.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.275
What do you mean
"Where it was going to be"?

07:32.369 --> 07:36.203
This fellow presumed,
and correctly as it turned out,

07:36.290 --> 07:39.327
that the island was always moving.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.619
Why do you think
you were never rescued?

07:43.714 --> 07:48.003
Now, while the movements
of the island seem random,

07:48.093 --> 07:52.712
this man and his team
created a series of equations...

07:54.224 --> 07:57.716
...which tell us,
with a high degree of probability,

07:57.811 --> 08:03.647
where it is going to be
at a certain point in time.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.944
Windows, as it were,

08:09.031 --> 08:13.115
that, while open, provide a route back.

08:13.952 --> 08:18.992
Unfortunately, these windows
don't stay open for very long.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.751
I'm sorry, excuse me.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.385
Am I really hearing this?
That's what this is about?

08:33.472 --> 08:35.804
You're going back
to the island willingly?

08:35.891 --> 08:39.054
Yes. Why are you here, Desmond?

08:43.148 --> 08:45.230
I came here to deliver a message.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.442
Daniel Faraday...

08:50.072 --> 08:53.360
...your son, sent me here.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.494
He wanted me to tell you that
the people on the island need your help.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.832
He said that only you could help them.
He didn't say Jack, Sun, Ben.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.786
- He said you.
- But I am helping, dear.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.798
Consider the message delivered.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.882
I'm sorry to tell you this, Desmond,
but the island isn't done with you yet.

09:19.977 --> 09:23.469
This woman cost me four years
of my life I'll never get back!

09:23.564 --> 09:27.898
Because you told me that l was
supposed to go to the island.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.976
That it was my bloody purpose.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.487
Listen to me, brother,
and listen carefully.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.783
These people, they're just using us.

09:41.874 --> 09:45.287
They're playing some kind of game,
and we're just the pieces.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.910
So whatever she tells you to do?

09:50.299 --> 09:51.379
lgnore it.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.970
You say the island's not done with me?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.922
Well, I'm done with the island.

10:14.531 --> 10:18.023
Jack, the binder in your hands

10:18.118 --> 10:21.281
shows all the air routes
that fly over the coordinates

10:21.371 --> 10:26.491
where I believe the island will be
in little more than a day from now.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.873
There's a commercial airliner
flying from LA to Guam...

10:31.590 --> 10:35.378
...that is going to go
right through our window.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.591
Ajira Airways, Flight 316.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.591
If you have any hope of the island
bringing you back,

10:43.685 --> 10:45.221
it must be that plane.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.271
You all need to be on it.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.602
It must be that flight.

10:59.034 --> 11:02.526
If you want to return,

11:03.247 --> 11:06.284
you need to recreate,
as best you can,

11:06.375 --> 11:10.664
the circumstances that brought you there
in the first place.

11:10.754 --> 11:15.589
That means as many of the same people

11:15.676 --> 11:18.292
as you are able to bring with you.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.213
And what if we can't get anyone else
to come with us?

11:22.307 --> 11:23.843
What if we're it?

11:23.934 --> 11:26.926
All I can tell you
is the result would be...

11:28.605 --> 11:32.314
- ...unpredictable.
- So that's it?

11:33.068 --> 11:37.937
We just get on that flight, and we
just hope that it works? That's all?

11:39.616 --> 11:42.107
No, that's not all, Jack.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.908
At least not for you.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.669
Come on in.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.840
- Ben and Sun...
- Heard what they needed to hear.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.967
And this does not concern them.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.136
Here we are.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.358
What's this?

12:21.450 --> 12:24.408
lt's John Locke's suicide note.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.620
- I didn't know.
- Why would you?

12:35.714 --> 12:41.459
Obituaries don't see fit to mention
when people hang themselves, Jack.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.841
Why would he kill himself?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.889
There are many reasons, I'm sure.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.691
But the only one that matters is this:

12:59.279 --> 13:02.237
He is going to help you get back.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.861
John is going to be a proxy.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.245
- A substitute.
- A substitute for who?

13:11.083 --> 13:14.450
Jack. Who do you think?

13:16.838 --> 13:19.295
You need to, as best you can,

13:19.383 --> 13:22.671
recreate the conditions
of the original flight.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.886
Which is why you need to give John
something of your father's.

13:29.977 --> 13:33.344
You have to get something
that belonged to your father,

13:33.438 --> 13:38.273
- and you need to give it to John.
- What?

13:38.860 --> 13:40.725
That's what you have to do.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.483
My father... is gone.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.829
My father has been dead for three years!

13:49.913 --> 13:51.414
You want me to...

13:52.916 --> 13:55.749
And to give it Locke? He's in a coffin!

13:57.421 --> 13:58.752
This is ridiculous!

13:58.839 --> 14:02.582
Stop thinking how ridiculous it is,

14:02.676 --> 14:06.385
and start asking yourself

14:06.471 --> 14:09.963
whether or not you believe
it's going to work.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.599
That's why it's called
a leap of faith, Jack.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.791
- Where's Sun?
- She left.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.968
And Locke?

14:49.056 --> 14:51.718
I mean, his body, the coffin.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.969
l have a friend looking after it.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.350
I'll pick it up
on my way to the airport.

15:05.155 --> 15:08.989
- What did she say to you, Jack?
- Nothing that matters.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.195
Who is she?

15:11.286 --> 15:14.744
Why is she... helping us?
How does she know all this?

15:19.169 --> 15:21.501
Thomas the Apostle.

15:24.341 --> 15:27.083
When Jesus wanted to return to Judea,

15:27.177 --> 15:30.260
knowing that he would
probably be murdered there,

15:30.347 --> 15:32.429
Thomas said to the others,

15:32.516 --> 15:35.633
"Let us also go,
that we might die with him."

15:37.813 --> 15:40.930
But Thomas was not remembered
for this bravery.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.015
His claim to fame came later...

15:44.361 --> 15:47.353
...when he refused to acknowledge
the resurrection.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.527
He just couldn't wrap
his mind around it.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.653
The story goes...

15:54.496 --> 15:59.035
...that he needed to touch
Jesus' wounds to be convinced.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.122
So was he?

16:04.214 --> 16:05.954
Of course he was.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.546
We're all convinced
sooner or later, Jack.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.724
Where are you going?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.479
I made a promise
to an old friend of mine.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.561
Just a loose end that needs tying up.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.363
See you at the airport, Jack.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.775
Hello?

17:14.951 --> 17:16.452
Yeah, this is him.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.782
He did what?

17:20.874 --> 17:23.035
This is the fourth time he's left.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.209
He's got to follow the rules
or move to our assisted facility.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.252
Yeah, I understand.

17:29.799 --> 17:35.135
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
here is my 'Fraidy Cat, Rabbit!

17:40.477 --> 17:42.968
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey, Jack.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.855
- Want to get out?
- The sooner the better.

17:47.484 --> 17:49.020
Could you please pick one?

17:50.111 --> 17:51.396
Look at it.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.487
Want to tell me
why you took off this time, Ray?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.193
Do I really need to answer that?

18:00.830 --> 18:03.446
Will you at least tell me
where the bus was headed?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.999
Doesn't matter. Anywhere I go
is somewhere better than here.

18:18.223 --> 18:20.464
- You packed a bag?
- Course I did.

18:22.978 --> 18:25.845
One of these times,
I'm actually gonna get away.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.934
And they won't ever find me, either.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.402
Take off again,
they're gonna throw you out.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.649
But what would I do
without my magic shows?

18:39.244 --> 18:41.155
Let me help you unpack, Granddad.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.198
So how are you, kiddo?
You seeing anyone special?

18:47.252 --> 18:51.120
What ever happened to the girl
you brought by with you that time?

18:51.214 --> 18:53.125
That pretty one with the freckles?

18:53.216 --> 18:56.083
- What was her name?
- Kate.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.260
We're not together anymore.

19:00.223 --> 19:05.559
Well, look at the bright side.
More time to come visit me.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.012
I'd love to, Granddad,
I really would, but...

19:10.900 --> 19:14.859
...I think I might be
going away for a while.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.896
Where's "away," exactly?

19:18.867 --> 19:22.451
- Somewhere better than here.
- Touche.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.044
Are these yours?

19:34.466 --> 19:38.129
No. Those were your father's.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.935
Your mom sent me
a box of his stuff after he died.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.229
Must have got mixed in
when I packed for a quick getaway.

19:58.281 --> 20:02.115
These shoes... Can I take them?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.488
Be my guest.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.661
Kate...

21:33.793 --> 21:35.704
What are you doing here?

21:36.546 --> 21:39.162
Are you still going back to the island?

21:40.091 --> 21:43.174
Yeah... Yeah, I think I am.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.048
Then I'm going with you.

21:50.894 --> 21:53.977
Kate, what happened?

21:54.063 --> 21:56.475
- Where's Aaron...
- Don't ask questions.

22:00.403 --> 22:02.394
If you want me to go with you...

22:04.115 --> 22:06.982
...you'll never ask me
that question again.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.318
You'll never ask me about Aaron.
Do you understand, Jack?

22:12.916 --> 22:13.905
Yes.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.292
Thank you.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.064
Morning.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.320
Morning.

22:51.454 --> 22:54.366
I made you some coffee.
And there's orange juice.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.792
You still like milk and two sugars?

23:04.509 --> 23:06.124
Yeah, sure.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.599
Those don't make much sense
for the island.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.141
You might want to consider
hiking boots.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.315
Those were my father's.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.856
When I went to pick up
his body in Sydney

23:29.951 --> 23:32.067
my dad didn't have any nice shoes.

23:32.161 --> 23:35.574
My mother wanted to have the funeral
as soon as I landed back in LA,

23:35.665 --> 23:39.032
but I thought, who the hell's
gonna see his feet?

23:39.127 --> 23:42.460
So I had these old, white tennis shoes

23:42.547 --> 23:46.039
and I said, "Use these.
Put these on him."

23:48.303 --> 23:51.261
'Cause he wasn't worth
a nice pair of shoes to me.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.635
Or the time it would take to get them.

23:55.685 --> 23:58.017
Why don't you get rid of them?

23:59.772 --> 24:02.764
Why hold on to something
that makes you feel sad?

24:11.993 --> 24:13.529
Go ahead.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.866
I'll see you at the airport, OK?

24:25.340 --> 24:27.797
- Hello.
- Hello, Jack. Are you there?

24:27.884 --> 24:31.797
- Yeah, is everything all right?
- Listen. We don't have much time.

24:31.888 --> 24:34.300
I've been... side-tracked,

24:34.390 --> 24:38.178
and I need you to pick up Locke's body
and take it to the airport.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.227
The coffin is at Simon's Butcher Shop.

24:42.315 --> 24:45.273
Corner of Grand and Hayes.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.727
- Why? What's happened to you?
- Just do it. Please.

25:10.927 --> 25:13.259
Are you Jill? Ben sent me.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.304
I know who you are, Dr. Shephard.
Come on in.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.556
What's in the bag?

25:28.486 --> 25:29.566
Sorry.

25:30.613 --> 25:33.855
Ben said to give you the van.
I gotta pull it around back.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.781
Give me about five minutes.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.892
Wherever you are, John...

26:50.526 --> 26:55.520
...you must be laughing your ass off
that I'm actually doing this.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.778
Because this...

27:01.162 --> 27:03.494
This is even crazier than you were.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.341
And, here.

27:15.176 --> 27:17.007
You can have that back.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.961
I've already heard
everything you had to say, John.

27:20.848 --> 27:23.339
You wanted me to go back,
I'm going back.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.695
Rest in peace.

27:43.746 --> 27:46.158
Mr. Shephard, if you'll
just bear with me.

27:46.249 --> 27:48.956
The reason for transporting
Mr. Bentham to Guam?

27:50.586 --> 27:53.578
These were his wishes.
He wanted to be buried there.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.834
Who will be the recipient upon arrival?

27:55.925 --> 27:59.964
- Is there a funeral home...
- It's me. I'll be escorting the body.

28:00.054 --> 28:02.420
And your relation to the deceased?

28:03.140 --> 28:04.755
He was a friend.

28:05.309 --> 28:09.302
Mr. Shephard, l have to inform you,
due to increased security measures,

28:09.397 --> 28:12.685
we are required to open the casket
and perform a screening.

28:12.775 --> 28:16.267
I assure you it's done with care.
Do you understand, Mr. Shephard?

28:17.280 --> 28:20.772
- Mr. Shephard?
- Yes. I understand.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.198
Then please sign here.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.373
Thank you for flying Ajira Air.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.496
My condolences.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.291
I'm sorry you lost your friend.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.041
Thank you.

28:43.639 --> 28:47.052
Please remove all jackets, sweaters,
jewelry and footwear.

28:47.143 --> 28:52.012
Remove all laptops and electronic
devices from your cases.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.516
Jack?

28:56.193 --> 28:57.694
Sun. Hey.

28:57.778 --> 29:01.270
- You're surprised to see me?
- | just...

29:01.824 --> 29:04.315
I thought, maybe,
you might change your mind.

29:05.703 --> 29:09.446
If there's even a chance that Jin
is alive, I have to be on that plane.

29:10.333 --> 29:14.497
Passengers, please have your tickets and
identification available for security.

29:31.270 --> 29:35.559
Preliminary boarding announcement
for Ajira Airways, flight 316,

29:35.650 --> 29:39.108
with service to Honolulu and Guam,
departing from gate 15.

29:39.195 --> 29:42.858
For those of you on the stand-by list,
we'll have seats available.

29:43.032 --> 29:47.822
We'd like to invite our pre-board, first
class passengers aboard at this time.

29:47.912 --> 29:51.279
- Stand-bys? There's no stand-bys.
- You don't need to worry.

29:51.374 --> 29:54.707
- There are 78 seats open.
- No.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.876
I bought those seats. All 78 of them.

29:57.964 --> 30:01.297
l'm Hugo Reyes. They're not open.
They're mine. Check and see.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.929
Yes, | see that. These people
want to get to their destination.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.803
Why would you not want them
to be able to travel?

30:16.857 --> 30:19.815
It doesn't matter why.
They can take the next plane.

30:21.737 --> 30:22.772
Hurley?

30:26.867 --> 30:29.279
What are you doing here?
How did you know...

30:29.370 --> 30:31.611
All that matters
is that I'm here, right?

30:35.001 --> 30:38.118
Well... I'm glad that you're here, man.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.096
OK, then...

30:49.432 --> 30:50.922
...let's do this.

30:54.687 --> 30:55.802
After you.

31:02.945 --> 31:04.481
Welcome to Ajira Air.

31:05.031 --> 31:07.613
Thank you, sir.
Row eight, on your left.

31:23.466 --> 31:25.297
You made it.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.586
Yeah. I made it.

31:54.830 --> 31:58.539
- That should be everybody.
- Hold on! Wait, please!

31:58.626 --> 32:00.617
Thank you for not closing it.

32:01.504 --> 32:04.120
- That's OK. Go right on in.
- Thanks.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.927
Wait! What's he doing here?

32:12.515 --> 32:14.551
- Hurley...
- No, no, he can't come!

32:14.975 --> 32:17.557
To get back, this is how
it's gonna have to be.

32:17.645 --> 32:21.388
- No one told me he was gonna be here!
- Who told you to be here, Hugo?

32:22.817 --> 32:24.773
Is everything OK?

32:24.860 --> 32:27.772
Yes, everything's fine. Right?

32:28.989 --> 32:30.980
Yes, Jack. I'll be fine.

32:32.034 --> 32:34.491
- Are you Jack Shephard? Seat 80?
- Yes.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.612
Security found this while
screening your cargo.

32:39.458 --> 32:43.918
If you don't mind taking your seats,
we're pushing back for takeoff.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.335
What's that, Jack?

32:50.636 --> 32:52.137
Nothing.

32:57.893 --> 33:01.135
The other people on this plane,
what's gonna happen to them?

33:02.439 --> 33:03.428
Who cares?

34:20.184 --> 34:21.344
Pretty crazy, huh?

34:23.896 --> 34:25.306
Which part?

34:25.397 --> 34:30.812
Hurley, Sayid...
being on the same plane.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.977
How did they end up here?

34:34.823 --> 34:36.859
They bought a ticket.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.156
You don't think it means something?

34:41.247 --> 34:44.614
That somehow... we're all back together?

34:45.960 --> 34:49.327
We're on the same plane, Jack.
That doesn't make us together.

34:51.090 --> 34:54.457
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
Welcome to Ajira Air.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.928
This is your captain, Frank J. Lapidus,

34:57.012 --> 34:59.298
on behalf of the crew, welcome aboard.

34:59.390 --> 35:03.429
We 're right on schedule, flying at
a very comfortable 30,000 feet.

35:03.519 --> 35:06.556
- So sit back, relax and enjoy...
- Excuse me, ma'am?

35:06.647 --> 35:08.387
Mr. Shephard. Can I help you?

35:09.692 --> 35:13.105
I need to talk to the pilot.
Frank Lapidus and l are old friends.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.277
Tell him I'm on board.
I'd appreciate it.

35:15.364 --> 35:19.482
All right. Sit down, you can't
be near the cockpit door when it's open.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.032
Sure, I understand.

35:26.709 --> 35:31.794
Captain, l have a passenger onboard.
Jack Shephard, he says he knows you.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.666
OK, sir.

35:37.261 --> 35:38.296
Well, hello, doc.

35:39.722 --> 35:41.212
Small world!

35:42.683 --> 35:47.302
- What are you doing going to Guam?
- What are you doing here?

35:47.396 --> 35:50.934
I picked this gig up eight months ago.
I fly this route all the time,

35:51.025 --> 35:54.563
sometimes I take the big birds
into New Delhi...

35:55.571 --> 35:58.404
Is that... Sayid?

35:59.908 --> 36:01.694
And Hurley?

36:06.373 --> 36:07.909
Wait a second.

36:11.128 --> 36:13.494
We're not going to Guam, are we?

36:28.896 --> 36:30.227
How can you read?

36:30.856 --> 36:32.972
My mother taught me.

36:38.405 --> 36:42.193
I can read, Jack,
because it beats what you're doing.

36:42.284 --> 36:45.026
- What's that?
- Waiting for something to happen.

36:49.792 --> 36:52.784
- What is going to happen?
- You tell me, Jack.

36:52.878 --> 36:56.211
You're the one who got to stay
after school with Ms. Hawking.

37:02.805 --> 37:04.887
Did you know Locke killed himself?

37:06.975 --> 37:09.057
No. No, I didn't.

37:19.154 --> 37:21.486
They found this stuffed in his pocket.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.192
I've been trying to get rid of it,
but it's like it's...

37:27.287 --> 37:29.323
...following me.

37:30.541 --> 37:34.784
I know it sounds crazy, but...

37:34.878 --> 37:37.540
...it feels like John
needs me to read it.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.834
Why don't you then?

37:49.268 --> 37:52.601
- Is it because you're afraid?
- Afraid of what?

37:52.688 --> 37:56.647
Afraid that he blames you.
That it's your fault he killed himself.

38:00.696 --> 38:02.186
Was it my fault?

38:04.450 --> 38:06.816
No, Jack. It wasn't your fault.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.160
Let me give you some privacy.

39:29.284 --> 39:30.865
Dude?

39:30.953 --> 39:33.114
You might wanna fasten your seatbelt.

39:35.082 --> 39:38.415
Fasten your seatbelt, ma'am.
Sir, put on your seatbelt.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.121
Seatbelts, please.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.908
Help!

40:21.003 --> 40:24.336
Anyone? Help!

40:42.024 --> 40:43.560
Kate?

40:51.033 --> 40:52.648
Kate?

40:59.416 --> 41:00.405
What happened?

41:07.215 --> 41:09.706
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.927
The plane...

41:18.644 --> 41:19.804
Where's the plane?

41:20.812 --> 41:26.307
I don't know. After that light,
I just woke up in the jungle.

41:26.401 --> 41:30.144
- So this is it? It's just us?
- I'm not sure.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.900
Do either of you remember crashing?

41:32.991 --> 41:34.492
Crashing? No.

41:34.576 --> 41:38.194
One second I'm being tossed around,
next I know I'm in the lagoon.

41:39.081 --> 41:41.117
Where is Sun and Sayid?

41:42.751 --> 41:44.707
Where's Ben?

41:44.795 --> 41:48.379
All right, let's spread out,
search the jungle.

41:49.383 --> 41:51.749
If you come across
anybody from the plane...

42:02.646 --> 42:03.635
Dude...

42:17.202 --> 42:18.783
Jin?
