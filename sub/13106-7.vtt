HE WA A HUMAN BEING.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.408
Holly:
ACTUALLY, THE TERM "HUMAN"

16:27.450 --> 16:29.008
REFERS TO OUR SPECIES
IN GENERAL,

16:29.050 --> 16:31.610
SO, DEAD OR ALIVE,
HE'S STILL HUMAN.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.151

WHO ARE YOU?

16:33.190 --> 16:35.988

NO FOOD OR DRINK
IN THE LAB.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.658
IT'S, UM,
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.464
SO, YOU'VE GOT A THUMB.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.728
YEP.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.567
THAT IS A THUMB.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.238
I'LL REHYDRATE THE TISSUE.

PLEASE DON'T USE
THAT EXPRESSION.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.341
WHAT, DID IT OFFEND YOU?

17:01.380 --> 17:03.883
NO.
IT'S JUST INACCURATE.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.117
MR., UH, GRASSI,
DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.515
NOPE. I DON'T.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.755
WELL, FOR ONE,
WE FOUND VINNY PIZZUTI

17:11.790 --> 17:13.951
HIDING IN THE BASEMENT
OF YOUR CAF.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.059

THAT YOU CAUGHT YOUR GUY.

UPON FURTHER REFLECTION,

17:30.610 --> 17:32.703
SHE DID NOT SEE
VINNY FIRE-BOMB A RESTAURANT.

17:32.750 --> 17:37.380
YOU KNOW, YEARS AGO,
I USED TO SING THAT SONG --

17:37.420 --> 17:41.459
"HOW DO YOU SOLVE A PROBLEM
LIKE MARIA?" -- FOR MY KIDS.

17:41.490 --> 17:43.355

THE LYRICS WRONG. [ CHUCKLES ]

17:46.830 --> 17:49.151

IN YOUR TRASH.

OOF! [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S GONNA BE
BAD FOR BUSINESS.

17:58.670 --> 18:01.173

WANT TO BUY CANNOLI

TO MARIO GRASSI'S SON,

20:13.170 --> 20:14.239

20:14.280 --> 20:16.578
HE GOES BY "LITTLE MARIO,"
FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

SO JUNIOR'S THUMB GETS CUT OFF
AND ENDS UP IN DAD'S TRASH?

20:21.880 --> 20:24.440
UH, NO. I DOUBT HE EVEN
KNOWS ABOUT IT.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.742

20:38.130 --> 20:39.267
YES, MA'AM.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.631
DO YOU THINK
HIS PERFORMANCE SUFFERED

20:40.670 --> 20:41.830
BECAUSE YOU WERE NEW
AT THE JOB?

20:41.870 --> 20:43.735

FROM OFFICER McNALLY.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.432

20:48.480 --> 20:50.107
I DON'T THINK
THAT WAS THE CASE.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.244
WHY NOT?

20:52.280 --> 20:54.817
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
THAT DUNCAN WAS WILLING

20:54.850 --> 20:56.818
TO LEARN FROM ME
OR ANYONE ELSE.

20:56.850 --> 20:59.114
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME?

20:59.150 --> 21:01.857
THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

21:01.890 --> 21:03.687
I DON'T THINK OFFICER MOORE

21:03.730 --> 21:07.029
EVER REALLY BOUGHT IN
TO THE ROOKIE/T.O. DYNAMIC.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.119
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT HE WAS PREPARED

21:09.160 --> 21:10.798
FOR THE STRESSES
OF THIS JOB

21:10.830 --> 21:13.799
OR WAS EVER REALLY WILLING
TO PUT HIMSELF IN HARM'S WAY.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.400
OKAY. SO NOW -- NOW
SHE'S CALLING ME A COWARD.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.135
YOU'RE JUST GONNA SIT THERE
AND JUST LET HER --

21:18.170 --> 21:19.808
IT'S HER TURN.
SHE'S JUST GIVING HER VERSION.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.569
IT'S NOT MY VERSION.
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

21:21.610 --> 21:23.544
I CALLED YOU FOR BACKUP,
AND YOU TURNED OFF YOUR RADIO.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.002
I TOLD YOU,
THE BATTERY WAS DEAD.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.870
AND I CHECKED IT, AND IT WASN'T!
I CHECKED.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.140
YOU LEFT ME HANGING, OKAY?

21:29.180 --> 21:30.716
I HAD A 12-YEAR-OLD WITNESS
IN THERE

21:30.750 --> 21:32.149
WITH AN ARMED GANG MEMBER.

21:32.190 --> 21:33.612
Helen: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
LET'S ALL JUST TAKE A BREATH.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.151
WE'LL AGREE THAT THE FACTS
ARE IN DISPUTE.

21:36.190 --> 21:39.023
THEY ARE, AS ARE MANY
OTHER "FACTS" IN THIS CASE.

21:39.060 --> 21:41.028
OFFICER McNALLY,
ARE YOU AWARE

21:41.060 --> 21:44.063
THAT THERE ARE SOME
DISCREPANCIES IN YOUR REPORTS?

21:44.100 --> 21:47.092
WE ARE AWARE, YES, THAT THERE
WERE A FEW OCCASIONS EARLY ON

21:47.130 --> 21:49.564
WHEN OFFICER McNALLY'S
PERFORMANCE REVIEWS

21:49.600 --> 21:52.068
OF OFFICER MOORE'S
WERE TOO GENEROUS, YES.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.577
AND ONCE AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO
HEAR IT FROM OFFICER McNALLY.

21:53.610 --> 21:54.975
YES, MA'AM.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.943
I WAS CONCERNED THAT DUNCAN
WOULD BE LABELED A FAILURE

22:01.980 --> 22:05.484
BEFORE HE REALLY HAD A CHANCE
TO PROVE HIMSELF.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.885
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

22:06.920 --> 22:08.979
HE HAD EVERY OPPORTUNITY
TO SUCCEED.

22:21.640 --> 22:25.269
HEY, I-I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.

22:25.310 --> 22:28.074
IT'S MY JOB.

22:28.110 --> 22:31.045
YEAH, AND IF YOU'RE NOT
BUSY LATER,

22:31.080 --> 22:34.015
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOU OUT
MAYBE FOR A DRINK

22:34.050 --> 22:37.349
AND -- I DON'T KNOW --
APOLOGIZE.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.745
YOU HAD A CHANCE
TO APOLOGIZE...

22:39.790 --> 22:43.521
THE DAY AFTER YOU WALKED OUT
ON ME OR THE WEEK AFTER...

22:43.560 --> 22:45.926
OR ANY ONE OF THE TIMES I CALLED
AND YOU DIDN'T PICK UP.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.689
I KNOW. JUST --
JUST GIVE ME A CHANCE,

22:47.730 --> 22:49.493
'CAUSE I REALLY WANT
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.540
WE MADE A LIST
OF ALL THE DISCREPANCIES,

23:11.590 --> 23:12.818
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IN NO WAY

23:12.850 --> 23:14.989
DID OFFICER McNALLY
MISLEAD ANYONE.

AS YOU KNOW, MY CLIENT'S ALREADY
GIVEN HIS WRITTEN STATEMENT

23:18.260 --> 23:19.921
ABOUT THE MATTER
OF HIS DISMISSAL.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.690

YES, THE SAME ONE WE FILED WITH
YOUR OFFICES THREE WEEKS AGO.

23:22.730 --> 23:24.129
READ IT.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.092
Sharon: I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THAT THERE'S BEEN

23:26.130 --> 23:27.791
AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT
SINCE THEN.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.728
OFFICER McNALLY SOUGHT OUT
AND SPOKE WITH MY CLIENT.

23:29.770 --> 23:30.998
I DID NOT SEEK HIM OUT.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.531
OFFICER MOORE WILL OUTLINE
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

MY TAB, AND...

23:43.950 --> 23:46.987
ANDY SAW ME AND --

23:47.020 --> 23:49.284
AND STARTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT THE CASE.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.254
DID YOU THINK
THAT WAS APPROPRIATE?

23:51.290 --> 23:53.599
NO. BUT SHE, UH --

23:53.630 --> 23:56.451
SHE WANTED TO BURY THE HATCHET,
SO I DECIDED TO LET HER TALK.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.263
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

24:02.800 --> 24:05.234
SHE ADMITTED THAT THE WHOLE
THING WAS HER FAULT.

24:05.270 --> 24:06.862
I DID NOT SAY THAT.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.879
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

24:09.910 --> 24:10.979
I-I GUESS --
I GUESS SHE JUST --

24:11.010 --> 24:12.147
SHE WANTED TO CLEAR
HER CONSCIENCE.

YOU DON'T KNOW, AND YOU GUESS.

HAVE IRREFUTABLE PROOF.

WAS NOT FORMALLY SUBMITTED,
