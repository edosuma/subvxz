WEBVTT

00:58.047 --> 01:02.886
At the centre of our existence
is a powerful dynamo.

01:05.513 --> 01:08.016
The sun.

01:08.099 --> 01:13.021
It gives us heat and light,
and drives the great engine of life.

01:47.225 --> 01:50.728
It's the food chain,
and we're all a part of it.

01:53.314 --> 01:58.153
No matter who you are,
even if you're a hardcore meat-eater,

01:58.236 --> 02:02.991
your dinner started with plants
somewhere turning sunlight into food.

02:03.075 --> 02:06.412
So we are, all of us,

02:06.871 --> 02:09.039
solar powered.

02:15.088 --> 02:19.551
Maybe the ancient Egyptians
were right to worship the sun.

02:19.593 --> 02:23.930
For four billion years,
the sun has given life to everything,

02:24.014 --> 02:26.934
on land, and in the sea.

02:44.953 --> 02:46.663
Rover One, this is Rover Two,

02:46.747 --> 02:51.960
We are at the edge of the wall
and are beginning our descent, Over,

02:52.002 --> 02:56.716
My name's Dijanna Figueroa, and I'm
a PhD student at UC Santa Barbara.

02:56.799 --> 03:00.720
- This is cool,
- Copy that. Starting descent. Over.

03:00.803 --> 03:04.265
I think I have
one of the coolest jobs in the world.

03:04.349 --> 03:07.060
Check out those
corkscrew coral down there,

03:07.143 --> 03:10.814
I'm a marine biologist.
I get to go to the bottom of the ocean

03:10.856 --> 03:14.485
and study the amazing organisms
that live there.

03:14.568 --> 03:17.905
There's nothing I'd rather be doing.

03:17.988 --> 03:21.158
Rover One, Rover One,
do you copy?

03:23.661 --> 03:26.164
This wall's pretty amazing,

03:26.247 --> 03:30.502
We're barely on the edge
of photosynthesis right here,

03:31.002 --> 03:33.505
Ambient light's really going now,

03:37.759 --> 03:42.348
You're totally reliant on
the technology that's in your little bubble

03:42.431 --> 03:46.477
to dive to that depth
where it's just a mystery down there.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.521
You never know what you're gonna see.

03:48.604 --> 03:52.150
- Look at all that krill,
- Oh, my gosh!

03:56.029 --> 04:01.118
Looks like we're in
krill heaven over here, Rover One,

04:01.201 --> 04:05.247
Yeah, roger that. Pretty incredible.

04:20.221 --> 04:23.392
Not seeing much of anything alive here,
Dijanna, What about you?

04:23.475 --> 04:27.980
Not much life at all, I think
we're pretty much out of the photic zone,

04:28.063 --> 04:30.691
It's like being on the moon, huh?

04:30.733 --> 04:32.735
Copy that,

04:35.071 --> 04:37.407
Hey, look, we got a
crinoid right down here,

04:37.490 --> 04:41.661
Hey, Dijanna, we got a crinoid here.
We finally found a citizen.

04:41.745 --> 04:44.414
Copy that,

04:44.456 --> 04:47.501
Yeah, it looks like we're getting deeper,
and most of the animals down here

04:47.584 --> 04:52.047
look like they're suspension feeders,
or particle feeders,

04:52.131 --> 04:58.054
With no light from the surface,
not much can survive down here.

04:59.055 --> 05:02.809
But there are places in the ocean
where sunlight has never reached,

05:02.892 --> 05:08.273
not since the world began,
and yet amazing life forms thrive there.

05:09.065 --> 05:13.737
So when I was invited to join the new
expedition to explore these places,

05:13.779 --> 05:16.281
I had to say yes.

05:19.785 --> 05:22.079
"Keldysh," "Keldysh,"
"Ares" bridge.

05:22.121 --> 05:24.707
Yeah, Dave, we're about to
begin dive reef right now,

05:24.791 --> 05:28.378
We got MIR One
going into the water at...

05:30.714 --> 05:34.259
Like this, so that we've got a central area
to work, Rover One is gonna stay...

05:34.301 --> 05:36.887
I'm Jim Cameron,
and here's the deal.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.931
I love this stuff.

05:39.014 --> 05:43.352
Exploration. Real honest-to-God
deep ocean exploration.

05:43.435 --> 05:48.566
This is way more exciting than
any made-up Hollywood special effects.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.278
These deep ocean expeditions
always seem like space missions to me.

05:52.320 --> 05:56.074
So, why not combine
outer space and inner space?

06:07.002 --> 06:09.004
Sure, we'll take marine biologists.

06:09.088 --> 06:14.135
But why not take astrobiologists
and space researchers?

06:14.177 --> 06:16.971
So that's how a bunch
of space scientists wound up out here,

06:17.013 --> 06:19.307
a thousand miles from the nearest land,

06:19.349 --> 06:22.060
where, right under our feet,
down in the darkness,

06:22.144 --> 06:26.773
are the most insane alien life forms
that have ever been discovered.

06:26.857 --> 06:28.776
Two ships,

06:28.859 --> 06:31.237
four manned submersibles,

06:31.320 --> 06:36.325
forty dives at ten sites
in both the Atlantic and Pacific.

06:38.119 --> 06:40.872
I like big operations,
but this one was off the hook.

06:40.955 --> 06:45.919
So we'll come down together, like this, and
we'll try to stay a couple of meters apart,

06:46.002 --> 06:47.921
because we don't want to drift off,

06:48.005 --> 06:51.091
If the communications are compromised
with the multiple subs in the water,

06:51.175 --> 06:54.637
all working on the same frequency,
some in Russian, some in English,

06:54.720 --> 06:57.056
I want to make sure
we stay on visual...

06:57.139 --> 06:59.851
The plan was to coordinate a four-sub dive,

06:59.892 --> 07:05.273
using both ships, so two MIRs and two
Rovers could rendezvous at the bottom.

07:05.356 --> 07:07.901
This would be a world first.

07:07.984 --> 07:10.612
- Hi,
- Dr, Sagalevitch,

07:10.695 --> 07:13.699
Anatoly Sagalevitch heads
the Manned Submersibles Laboratory

07:13.740 --> 07:16.243
for the Russian
Academy of Sciences.

07:16.326 --> 07:18.537
We've been working together
for almost a decade.

07:18.579 --> 07:20.289
There we are,

07:20.372 --> 07:22.583
The adventurers,

07:22.625 --> 07:26.629
It's all his fault that we're doing this,
because we did Titanic twice,

07:26.713 --> 07:29.090
in '95 and '01,
and we did Bismarck.

07:29.174 --> 07:31.926
Sometime around the middle
of Bismarck, Anatoly says:

07:32.010 --> 07:34.130
"You know, these wrecks are good,
they're interesting,

07:34.179 --> 07:36.473
but you have to do something real,"

07:36.556 --> 07:39.143
"We have to do some science,
Something real,"

07:40.018 --> 07:43.272
Genya Chernaiev
is one of the Russian MIR pilots.

07:43.314 --> 07:46.525
He's been flying submersibles
for over 20 years now.

07:46.609 --> 07:49.987
The most important thing about this boat,
of course, is the view,

07:50.071 --> 07:52.657
320 degrees unobstructed,

07:52.740 --> 07:55.076
This view makes the Rovers unique,

07:55.118 --> 07:58.997
but because of the acrylic sphere,
they can't go as deep as the MIRs.

07:59.080 --> 08:03.293
So they'd only be joining us
for the Atlantic leg of the journey.

08:04.586 --> 08:07.464
We also had Jake,
the little remotely operated 'bot

08:07.506 --> 08:11.427
we'd used to explore
the Titanic and Bismarck wrecks.

08:11.469 --> 08:15.473
Jake had been modified
to test a variety of sampling tools.

08:16.307 --> 08:20.312
My brother Mike is Jake's inventor
and our pilot on this expedition.

08:20.395 --> 08:24.775
His challenge was to steer Jake safely
around the volcanically active vent sites,

08:24.816 --> 08:27.361
and not fry our little 'bot.

08:27.444 --> 08:29.947
This would hopefully allow us
to get up close and personal

08:30.030 --> 08:32.991
with the creatures we'd come to see.

08:33.033 --> 08:36.496
We've checked the decks twice,
all the rigging looks squared away,

08:36.578 --> 08:38.998
My other brother was with us too.

08:39.039 --> 08:43.001
JD was the safety and communications
officer on board the "Ares."

08:43.044 --> 08:46.131
Or, as he called it,
"crap job number 27."

08:46.214 --> 08:50.260
Our launch procedure is as per the book,
Everything's straightforward,

08:50.344 --> 08:54.473
She's first, she's second, Recovery
is determined by Jim from the bottom,

08:54.515 --> 08:56.350
Now, recovery can go either way,

09:00.354 --> 09:04.984
We chose the "Ares"
for the giant A-frame at her stern.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.999
Its massive hydraulic cylinders
can lift the sub off the deck

09:19.041 --> 09:21.544
and out over the water with ease.

09:21.627 --> 09:26.674
It's one of the safest ways
to launch a large payload off of any ship,

09:26.716 --> 09:30.553
and we constantly tested our procedures
until we had everything dialed in

09:30.637 --> 09:33.223
for the upcoming four-sub dive.

09:36.893 --> 09:39.521
All right, let's do this,
All stations, let's do this,

09:39.563 --> 09:43.901
I'm gonna need everybody
to keep their ears open, be observant,

09:43.943 --> 09:46.612
Keep your eyes open
for the lights of the other submersibles,

09:46.696 --> 09:50.575
And, you know, it's gonna be challenging,
But I think we can pull it off,

09:50.616 --> 09:53.328
All right, here we go, Jacks up!

09:53.411 --> 09:56.748
Finally, everything was in motion.

09:59.292 --> 10:02.254
And in the middle of the North Atlantic,

10:02.337 --> 10:05.591
a thousand miles from the nearest land,

10:09.303 --> 10:12.807
our little expedition
was about to make history.

10:12.890 --> 10:15.226
We're in motion,
We're in motion,

10:22.692 --> 10:25.946
Nice and slow, blue winch,
Nice and slow,

10:25.988 --> 10:28.490
- Now we're gunnin' runnin', huh?
- Yeah,

10:28.574 --> 10:31.035
At least, that was the plan.

10:31.118 --> 10:33.496
All stop, all stop, All stop,

10:39.419 --> 10:42.005
I copy you, Lima Charlie.
The only problem we have right now

10:42.088 --> 10:44.841
is the A-frame. Over.

10:44.924 --> 10:48.303
I'll let you know
as soon as the crew gets it sorted.

10:48.345 --> 10:52.307
About an hour and 15 minutes
ago, we had a safety stop,

10:52.349 --> 10:55.644
Uh, what we know
is the A-frame went south,

10:56.145 --> 11:00.858
It's a complete breakdown of the cylinder,
It ultimately amounts to a cold stop,

11:00.942 --> 11:03.194
These bolts all shot,

11:03.277 --> 11:08.366
And all this paint that's been here forever
busts loose because of that situation,

11:08.450 --> 11:11.161
And it happened on that one as well,

11:11.661 --> 11:14.998
Yeah, right, I mean, we're in the
middle of the ocean with a broken A-frame,

11:15.040 --> 11:17.084
That's what it sounds like to me,

11:17.167 --> 11:19.253
How you gonna get that fixed up?

11:19.336 --> 11:23.174
Call A-frames "R" Us? You know,
have their little service ship come by?

11:23.257 --> 11:26.094
Thousand miles from shore?

11:27.011 --> 11:28.530
We don't have to move on it immediately,

11:28.554 --> 11:33.101
but it's at least something
we need to start processing,

11:34.811 --> 11:37.064
Well, I mean,
if they can't fix this,

11:37.147 --> 11:41.193
and we don't have an alternate way
of launching the sub, it's over,

11:41.276 --> 11:43.320
the expedition's over,

11:44.655 --> 11:46.855
If you are going to explore,
you have to accept the fact

11:46.907 --> 11:49.952
that on the one hand there's risk.
You have to stay up all night long

11:50.036 --> 11:52.765
thinking about every single factor
that's involved in what you're doing,

11:52.789 --> 11:55.041
and making sure that
you've thought of everything.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.752
'Cause if you can eliminate
all the things you can think of,

11:57.836 --> 12:01.089
you've eliminated nine-tenths
of what can go wrong,

12:01.173 --> 12:05.386
That way, when that last one-tenth
pops up, and you're in the middle of it,

12:05.427 --> 12:08.281
you don't have to worry about all the
other stuff 'cause you've dealt with that,

12:08.305 --> 12:13.978
Look, to be completely serious, your idea
about cutting that bulwark away at the side

12:14.061 --> 12:16.481
is the best idea I've heard
for an alternate plan yet,

12:16.564 --> 12:18.042
Just cut the side right out of the ship,

12:18.066 --> 12:20.276
I say we go clear that
with the captain right now,

12:20.360 --> 12:23.572
OK, Well, plan B,

12:48.724 --> 12:50.517
All right,
we can talk it through tonight,

12:50.601 --> 12:53.437
but I don't think
we should try for an all-up drill tonight,

12:53.479 --> 12:55.599
I mean, people have been up
since 4:30 in the morning,

13:06.409 --> 13:10.163
It became apparent that
the only way to get the subs off the "Ares"

13:10.247 --> 13:15.919
was to use the main crane and by sliding the
submersibles off the side of the vessel.

13:15.961 --> 13:22.259
With a crane that is 30, 40, 50 feet above
the actual pick point of the submersible,

13:22.301 --> 13:26.222
once an object starts to swing,
you can't stop it.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.601
It's called the wrecking-ball effect.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.979
Once it gets away from you,
you can't get it back.

13:36.149 --> 13:40.362
I'm guessing we've got six to eight feet of
travel here, I'm thinking we should use...

13:40.445 --> 13:44.033
It ultimately resulted
in Jim writing a 40-page manual

13:44.116 --> 13:46.952
on what he thought the best way
to launch the vessel was.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.621
This eye feeds into that...

13:48.704 --> 13:52.875
So we spent a long time
devising four separate pick points,

13:52.959 --> 13:56.171
as well as eight different points
of connection to the submersible

13:56.212 --> 13:58.214
to stop it from swaying.

14:01.677 --> 14:04.596
We would practice all night long.

14:04.680 --> 14:07.933
At dawn the following day, we were ready
to attempt it for the first time.

14:08.017 --> 14:11.687
We spent the past 24 hours rebuilding
the entire launch and recovery system,

14:11.771 --> 14:16.859
which required us to cut this wall out, rerig
every capstan, rerig every block and tackle,

14:18.945 --> 14:21.656
We've got about
20 different points of rigging,

14:21.698 --> 14:24.367
Every single point
has to be checked by me, by hand,

14:24.451 --> 14:27.120
Any single point fails, anything,

14:27.204 --> 14:30.040
from the blue winch
to the cable itself, snaps, breaks,

14:30.124 --> 14:34.170
not only do we lose the sub, but we risk
the chance of losing somebody on the deck,

14:34.253 --> 14:37.715
I'm looking at every pulley
under tension, and it's looking at me,

14:42.804 --> 14:45.432
Keldysh, be advised,
we are go for launch ops,

14:45.515 --> 14:49.186
Deck crew, be advised we have 15
minutes before we start launch operation,

14:49.269 --> 14:51.521
- Paul?
- Yeah, roger that, DP control,

14:51.563 --> 14:55.526
MIR One's going into
the water right now,

14:55.609 --> 14:58.446
Let's see the crane, guys,

15:21.679 --> 15:24.432
- Oh, yes,
- Stow that, get on the line,

15:24.473 --> 15:26.476
Bye-bye,

15:28.186 --> 15:30.271
Tim, Straps off,

15:36.403 --> 15:40.282
Keep going, keep going, keep
going, keep going, keep going, keep going,

16:04.141 --> 16:08.354
DP control to "Keldysh."
MIRs are beginning their descent. Over.

16:08.938 --> 16:12.108
Say goodbye to the surface world,

16:14.318 --> 16:16.571
I love this part,

16:17.322 --> 16:19.783
Everything is a go,
We're ready to vent,

16:19.824 --> 16:22.577
SO, SO, Rover One,

16:22.661 --> 16:24.120
Go ahead, Rover One.

16:24.162 --> 16:28.208
We are about to start
our tandem descent,

16:30.461 --> 16:33.672
OK, here we go,
And three, two, one...

16:33.714 --> 16:37.301
- Venting. Go, go, go.
- OK, we're venting now,

16:37.385 --> 16:39.387
Venting now,

16:41.639 --> 16:45.268
All right, Rock and roll, Here we go,

16:55.612 --> 16:59.367
The descent to Lost City
takes about 30 minutes,

16:59.450 --> 17:04.414
which is plenty of time
to think about what you're about to do.

17:05.455 --> 17:08.460
My name is Loretta Hidalgo,
and I'm an explorer.

17:08.542 --> 17:12.380
Copy that, Rover One, This is Rover Two,
hearing you loud and clear,

17:12.464 --> 17:17.301
My goal is to one day
explore the reaches of space.

17:20.681 --> 17:25.519
- That is the bomb, Yeah!
- We're at 840 meters,

17:25.560 --> 17:31.067
Surface, this is Rover Two, We are
at 840 meters, We are on the bottom,

17:33.653 --> 17:36.907
God, these structures are gorgeous,

17:36.990 --> 17:41.411
OK, there's the rendezvous point,
and they are right there,

17:42.246 --> 17:47.793
MIR Two, MIR Two,
this is Rover Two. Do you copy? Over.

17:49.712 --> 17:53.758
MIR Two, MIR Two,
this is Rover Two, Do you copy?

17:53.841 --> 17:59.556
That's affirmative, Rover Two.
We have a very good visual on you.

18:01.975 --> 18:05.729
We were doing something
that no humans had ever done.

18:05.771 --> 18:10.776
This was the first time that four deep
submersibles had ever dived together.

18:10.860 --> 18:15.281
The water pressure that you get
down at 3,000 feet is mind-boggling.

18:15.364 --> 18:18.826
If you've ever carried a bucket of water,
you know that's about a foot of water.

18:18.910 --> 18:22.122
Now imagine being under
3,000 feet of water.

18:22.205 --> 18:25.000
And all that weight
of all those buckets lined up on your head

18:25.083 --> 18:28.295
are all pressing down on you
and on the submarine.

18:28.337 --> 18:31.757
Definitely not something
that humans were evolved to do.

18:31.799 --> 18:36.178
OK, Loretta, can you relay to Mike
that we are in position for 'bot ops? Over,

18:36.679 --> 18:38.890
Copy,

18:38.973 --> 18:42.310
MIR Two, MIR Two,
are you go for 'bot deploy?

18:43.978 --> 18:47.232
Uh, roger that,
We'll get set for 'bot ops, Over,

18:47.649 --> 18:49.860
- OK, There it is,
- Yeah, there he is,

18:49.943 --> 18:51.320
There's Jake,

18:51.403 --> 18:54.323
Can you see his tether spinning out?

18:54.406 --> 18:57.326
It's like a spider spinning its web,

19:02.999 --> 19:06.336
I'm just gonna pull a little tether
out here, to the left, into the current,

19:06.419 --> 19:08.963
and then I'll yaw back to the right,

19:10.048 --> 19:11.408
We were really
pushing the boundary

19:11.466 --> 19:14.636
of being out in
an extreme environment.

19:15.637 --> 19:20.809
I had this incredible experience of feeling
like I'd been transported into the future.

19:20.851 --> 19:22.978
Hi, 'bot!

19:23.062 --> 19:28.818
That I was on a space mission, and
we were watching another spacecraft

19:28.860 --> 19:30.904
coming up to work with us.

19:32.989 --> 19:37.244
Hi, Mike, Get me out of here,

19:37.327 --> 19:40.038
- Affirmative,
- Affirmative,

19:49.590 --> 19:54.887
Push in a tiny bit in here, and I get
just right in as close as I can go,

19:59.142 --> 20:01.520
Oh, wow,
Are you seeing the structure?

20:01.561 --> 20:03.855
Yeah, Beautiful,

20:03.897 --> 20:09.194
OK, Mike, If you come right
about 30 degrees, and come forward,

20:09.236 --> 20:12.823
you'll come to a big fan right on
the corner of that rock, Over,

20:12.907 --> 20:15.034
Copy that.

20:17.578 --> 20:20.999
Oh, this is gorgeous,
I feel like I'm out there,

20:21.082 --> 20:24.044
- Are you liking this?
- I'm loving this,

20:26.421 --> 20:31.093
OK, I'm gonna have to come up a little bit,
Well, we're doing pretty good here,

20:31.176 --> 20:36.098
I've encountered a little
more current than I expected right here,

20:36.182 --> 20:38.100
Oh, my gosh!

20:38.142 --> 20:40.394
Hello, Mr, Big,

20:40.436 --> 20:44.732
He's like, "Don't even mess with me,"

20:44.774 --> 20:47.777
Oh! Oh, my God,

20:50.989 --> 20:52.991
Wow,

20:56.245 --> 20:58.247
Wow,

21:02.460 --> 21:05.129
Kevin Hand is one of our astrobiologists.

21:05.213 --> 21:07.257
And he's a brilliant guy.

21:07.298 --> 21:09.217
Really.

21:09.300 --> 21:12.345
That's one of the interesting things
I think about the Europan ocean,

21:12.429 --> 21:15.474
is that you can ask
two questions about life on Europa,

21:15.557 --> 21:18.727
Could life have originated on Europa?

21:18.811 --> 21:22.147
Astrobiology is
the study of life on other worlds.

21:22.189 --> 21:26.777
But since Kevin doesn't have any real
extraterrestrial specimens to analyze yet,

21:26.861 --> 21:29.405
he's out here doing
the next best thing:

21:29.489 --> 21:34.411
Looking at life in the extreme conditions
of the deep ocean.

21:35.745 --> 21:39.082
He's a theory guy
and he's never been to sea before,

21:39.166 --> 21:43.087
let alone inside a submersible
headed to the bottom of the ocean.

21:43.170 --> 21:45.923
Here we go, Into the unknown,

22:05.402 --> 22:11.367
Rover Two, MIR Two copies you
loud and clear now. Loud and clear now.

22:23.838 --> 22:28.468
Yeah, it looks like
it goes down for a long ways,

22:30.888 --> 22:33.766
MIR Two is right above us,

22:34.433 --> 22:38.854
Very few people get to see
MIR Two from this angle,

22:38.896 --> 22:41.065
That is fantastic,

22:47.948 --> 22:53.537
The scale of these things
is so much larger than I had imagined,

22:53.620 --> 22:55.789
It's just amazing,

22:57.291 --> 23:01.796
We've got this huge,
huge carbonate structure,

23:01.879 --> 23:03.881
Unbelievable,

23:04.549 --> 23:09.429
Copy that.
Right rotator going up, rotator going up.

23:12.390 --> 23:16.770
It's just the hot water just flowing up
and slowly forming stalactites,

23:16.812 --> 23:22.610
Upside-down stalactites are slowly
deposited, millennium after millennium,

23:24.528 --> 23:26.322
So what's interesting
about these

23:26.405 --> 23:29.283
is that you don't necessarily
need plate tectonics,

23:29.367 --> 23:35.206
You need some means for the water
to react with the deep mantle rock,

23:35.290 --> 23:38.585
And then you get
the serpentinization reaction

23:38.627 --> 23:43.715
which produces the heat that drives
the formation of such systems,

23:43.799 --> 23:45.259
It's absolutely phenomenal,

23:45.301 --> 23:49.513
Do you want to go ahead
and proceed to the summit? Over.

23:49.597 --> 23:51.641
Roger that,

24:14.165 --> 24:18.169
- There's warm water up here,
- Yeah,

24:20.255 --> 24:24.175
The vent fluid is just
coming right up out of here,

24:27.679 --> 24:29.681
Wow, This is just amazing,

24:30.682 --> 24:33.143
Our technology is just
at the level now

24:33.185 --> 24:36.981
where we can safely explore
the depths of our own ocean,

24:37.022 --> 24:39.567
- Kinda friable,
- Yeah,

24:40.610 --> 24:42.362
OK,

24:43.363 --> 24:45.949
Yeah! Look at that,

24:46.950 --> 24:49.661
- We got a rock,
- Hey, we got a sample,

24:55.959 --> 24:58.212
Rover One, Rover One,
this is Rover Two, Do you...

24:58.295 --> 25:00.381
- Oh, my goodness, look at that!
- Oh, Christ!

25:00.464 --> 25:01.882
Holy cow,

25:01.924 --> 25:04.385
- OK, stop it, stop it, stop it,
- Kevin. You seeing this?

25:04.469 --> 25:08.932
Look at that thing,
That is absolutely unreal,

25:09.015 --> 25:10.892
See if you can
get your lights right on it.

25:10.934 --> 25:12.978
Roger that,

25:13.061 --> 25:17.524
Oh, my goodness,
Look at that, it's just amazing,

25:19.026 --> 25:21.403
Oh, man, look at this thing,

25:21.487 --> 25:24.657
Look at this thing,
This is incredible,

25:33.041 --> 25:36.711
How can something
like that be alive?

25:36.795 --> 25:41.258
How does a creature like this work?
That is absolutely phenomenal,

25:42.843 --> 25:44.720
Beautiful,

25:45.721 --> 25:47.890
Absolutely beautiful,

25:49.767 --> 25:53.104
See the reticulation inside this thing?
Look at that,

25:53.146 --> 25:55.565
That is amazing,

25:57.901 --> 25:59.986
I have no idea what that is,

26:01.905 --> 26:03.907
- No,
- That's what I love about this stuff,

26:03.949 --> 26:08.787
Every single dive, you're gonna see
something you've never seen before,

26:08.871 --> 26:14.085
And you might even see something
that nobody's ever seen before,

26:37.485 --> 26:39.737
Are you seeing this thing?
Look at this,

26:39.820 --> 26:43.366
This is, like,
the ugliest fish in the world,

26:48.997 --> 26:54.878
Oh, he's got feet! Look, he's got feet,
He's got, like, little toe-socks,

26:59.842 --> 27:05.807
The thing about deep diving is you
always need to expect the unexpected.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.857
Oh, my God, look at that squid,

27:13.940 --> 27:16.151
Oh, it's massive,

27:17.194 --> 27:19.446
Look, look, look, Quick, look,

27:19.530 --> 27:22.157
See it?

27:22.199 --> 27:24.118
Absolutely fantastic,

28:24.391 --> 28:27.185
Look at that fish,
You see that guy?

28:51.503 --> 28:56.341
All right, we got us a Dumbo,
Been hoping for this for a while,

29:00.805 --> 29:05.601
What a beautiful animal,
What a beautiful animal, Look at that,

29:05.643 --> 29:07.645
Like a dancer,

29:15.695 --> 29:17.781
What an amazing creature,

29:32.380 --> 29:35.258
God, you could watch this guy all day,

29:35.341 --> 29:38.887
Almost looks like
he's glowing from within,

29:59.951 --> 30:03.663
MIR One, MIR One,
This is Rover Two, Do you copy?

30:03.705 --> 30:08.335
MIR One, MIR One,
do you copy? This is Rover Two.

30:08.377 --> 30:12.506
MIR One, MIR One,
This is Rover Two, Do you copy?

30:12.590 --> 30:17.053
It's intermittent, Jim,
Sometimes yes and sometimes no,

30:19.222 --> 30:21.307
Uh, roger, Mike,

30:21.391 --> 30:25.353
We're seriously low on power
and will have to leave the bottom,

30:25.437 --> 30:28.231
I cannot get ahold of Vince,

30:28.315 --> 30:30.317
We must go up,

30:33.195 --> 30:35.906
Genya, We must go up,

30:36.907 --> 30:40.202
Oh, he's trying to say something,
about...

30:40.244 --> 30:42.371
He's trying to say...
Look out the porthole,

30:42.455 --> 30:44.248
I can't see him,

30:44.290 --> 30:46.251
Can you call surface?

30:46.292 --> 30:48.878
He's saying, "Up and over"?
Might be,

30:48.962 --> 30:53.800
We need you to contact the surface
that we are ascending,

30:59.390 --> 31:02.768
Can't read it, Zoom in,
Let's see if you can read the sign,

31:06.689 --> 31:10.819
"Contact surface, must surface,"
Understood, We'll contact them right now,

31:13.488 --> 31:17.993
Ares surface comm,
Rover Two leaving the bottom

31:18.076 --> 31:24.542
at X minus 244, Y minus 25,

31:24.625 --> 31:27.962
depth 741 meters,

32:16.639 --> 32:20.601
- So, how was it, Jim?
- We got the goods, We definitely got it,

32:22.812 --> 32:26.358
Ah, that thing is phenomenal,
How you doing?

32:28.110 --> 32:32.072
- What did you see down there?
- Oh, it was just incredible, Just incredible,

32:32.155 --> 32:35.868
There was a huge, um...
Was it a jellyfish?

32:37.536 --> 32:39.956
Some type of gelatinous...

32:40.039 --> 32:41.833
Massive, Like, a meter,

32:41.874 --> 32:44.877
We think that it was feeding
off of the, uh,

32:44.919 --> 32:50.592
off the amphipods and the plankton
and the copepods that were next to...

32:50.675 --> 32:53.112
- Hanging out at the lights?
- Hanging out at the light, yeah,

32:53.136 --> 32:55.597
- How's it work?
- Man, we don't know,

32:55.681 --> 32:58.350
- But it's there, So it's working somehow,
- Exactly,

32:58.392 --> 33:01.854
- Life's pretty cool,
- Yeah, absolutely fantastic,

33:01.937 --> 33:04.357
- Welcome back, Kevin,
- Thanks,

33:05.775 --> 33:07.985
- Team Rover,
- Go team Rover!

33:14.284 --> 33:17.120
My name is Maya Tolstoy,
and I'm a marine seismologist

33:17.204 --> 33:20.457
at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.544
I study underwater volcanoes,

33:23.627 --> 33:28.007
and particularly I study the earthquakes
that these volcanoes make.

33:28.090 --> 33:31.344
And I'm trying to understand
how the Earth is made,

33:31.427 --> 33:34.848
how the surface of
the planet is formed.

33:36.224 --> 33:40.437
I'm going to be deploying
ocean-bottom seismometers.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.065
Those are instruments
that listen to earthquakes

33:43.106 --> 33:46.318
and other noises on the ocean floor.

33:49.613 --> 33:53.451
In the ocean,
the light only goes so far.

33:53.993 --> 33:58.039
And so sound allows you
to basically see the bottom of the ocean,

33:58.122 --> 34:04.254
and to see into the ocean crust, the way
that light lets you see on the surface.

34:08.425 --> 34:14.431
We put the instruments over the side of
the ship. They drop, they gather the data.

34:15.474 --> 34:19.478
Normally, I don't have to dive
in order to do my job.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.440
So it was very exciting
to finally see the environment

34:23.483 --> 34:26.110
that I've been working on
for over a decade.

34:26.194 --> 34:27.696
MIR two, copy,

34:27.779 --> 34:30.949
We have a visual on you.
We are inbound.

34:30.991 --> 34:33.659
Roger that,

34:34.453 --> 34:37.540
- Can you see them?
- Yeah, It's out my window,

34:37.623 --> 34:39.708
It looks like a spaceship,

34:43.463 --> 34:45.465
Wow,

34:45.505 --> 34:49.344
That's incredible,
That's like another planet,

34:53.724 --> 34:56.393
It's such
an incredible world down there,

34:56.476 --> 34:58.979
and it's so important
to the formation of our planet.

34:59.021 --> 35:02.608
It's where two thirds
of the surface of our world was created,

35:02.691 --> 35:05.653
and we still know so little about it.

35:07.029 --> 35:09.240
Do you see how
they're all shiny and glassy?

35:09.324 --> 35:12.911
- Oh, yeah, Look at that,
- That shows that it cooled superquickly,

35:12.994 --> 35:17.499
That's just, like, it really turns to
glass, basically, To obsidian, it's called,

35:17.541 --> 35:18.667
Look at that,

35:18.709 --> 35:21.211
And you see how there's
hardly any sediment on it?

35:21.295 --> 35:26.467
That's when it's really fresh,
This is brand-new crust we're looking at,

35:26.550 --> 35:27.468
Wow,

35:27.551 --> 35:32.181
Now, can you just imagine
being down here when this stuff erupts?

35:32.223 --> 35:35.685
Molten rock oozing out
and hitting the freezing cold water,

35:35.727 --> 35:38.438
I just can't imagine it,
It must have been insane,

35:38.521 --> 35:40.774
Must look pretty cool,

35:40.857 --> 35:44.319
For the few seconds before you die,

35:52.787 --> 35:55.206
I miss my son.

35:55.248 --> 35:57.458
He's five months old.

35:57.542 --> 36:01.755
It was such a hard decision
to make to come out here.

36:01.838 --> 36:06.259
But I think it's important to study
one of the most remarkable phenomenon

36:06.343 --> 36:09.304
we've ever discovered
in the oceans.

36:13.809 --> 36:16.812
MIR Two, just keep going
upslope on this heading,

36:16.896 --> 36:20.400
The chimneys should be
at the top of this sulfide mound, Over,

36:20.942 --> 36:23.278
Roger that,

36:34.832 --> 36:37.001
Wow,

36:37.084 --> 36:39.086
There it is,

37:00.150 --> 37:01.610
All around our world,

37:01.694 --> 37:05.156
running down the middle of the oceans
like seams on a baseball,

37:05.239 --> 37:08.284
are these cracks,
these spreading centers,

37:08.367 --> 37:12.997
where the crust of the planet
is literally ripping apart.

37:14.249 --> 37:16.751
Up above, the sea looks normal.

37:21.173 --> 37:23.759
But two miles down,
it's a violent landscape

37:23.842 --> 37:28.723
where fresh lava flows
out of the crack and freezes into rock.

37:31.350 --> 37:35.355
When the sea water seeps down to the
molten rock just beneath the new crust,

37:35.438 --> 37:38.984
it gets superheated,
far hotter than boiling.

37:39.067 --> 37:42.863
But it can't boil, because of the intense
pressure at the bottom of the ocean.

37:42.946 --> 37:46.241
So it comes roaring up
out of the sea floor.

37:47.242 --> 37:51.372
When the superheated water hits the
freezing ocean, minerals condense out,

37:51.455 --> 37:55.418
forming the chimneys,
and creating the black smoke.

38:23.823 --> 38:26.117
When you see black smoke,
what you're really seeing

38:26.201 --> 38:29.162
is a blowtorch of
superheated water.

38:33.542 --> 38:36.253
Uh, we're getting in position
to get a water sample

38:36.337 --> 38:38.631
from the top
of one of these structures, Over,

38:38.714 --> 38:41.717
Yeah, roger that.
That's good.

38:45.930 --> 38:50.310
OK, let's get in as close as we can
on this chimney, Genya,

38:50.393 --> 38:54.439
These chimneys
reach 750 degrees Fahrenheit,

38:54.523 --> 38:58.694
and that's hot enough to melt
the windows of your submersible.

38:58.777 --> 39:00.988
That's a bad thing.

39:01.071 --> 39:05.868
Mental note: Don't melt
the windows of the submersible.

39:07.578 --> 39:10.081
Guys, we're getting really close
to this black smoker here,

39:10.164 --> 39:13.460
- Close enough?
- I think this is maybe a little too close,

39:13.543 --> 39:17.339
Uh, well, we're starting
to get into the plume,

39:18.423 --> 39:20.008
Right underneath the sub,

39:20.092 --> 39:21.718
Genya, move back.
You better move back.

39:21.802 --> 39:24.888
OK, I start to move back,

39:31.312 --> 39:35.900
That's normal.
We usually drive right in 'em like that.

39:35.984 --> 39:40.322
We were right on top of it,
That was a little freaky,

39:49.582 --> 39:51.584
That's pretty cool, Kevin,

39:51.667 --> 39:56.297
The geology's fascinating.
But it's not why I came out here.

39:58.383 --> 40:02.220
Keldysh, Keldysh, MIR Two,
We are on the bottom,

40:02.303 --> 40:05.390
Depth 3526 meters,

40:05.474 --> 40:09.478
And we are at the top
of the Moose structure, Over,

40:12.690 --> 40:16.527
These sites were
first visited 25 years ago by geologists.

40:16.569 --> 40:19.363
And they weren't looking for life.

40:20.990 --> 40:23.409
But it wasn't until
they got into a submersible

40:23.493 --> 40:28.415
and went down to the bottom
to see with their own eyes...

40:28.498 --> 40:34.379
It was like, "Oh, my God. There's
life down here, and it's beautiful."

40:34.421 --> 40:36.674
It's an entire ecosystem.

40:40.177 --> 40:42.096
Wow, That's awesome,

40:46.059 --> 40:49.521
Copy that. That's what
we're imaging right now. Over.

40:50.230 --> 40:56.236
- Look at all that hot water,
- They're right in the flow,

41:00.199 --> 41:02.368
Oh, man, Check this out,

41:02.451 --> 41:08.374
It's like liquid fire, and these
guys are dancing right next to it,

41:08.416 --> 41:11.794
They are really tickling
the dragon's tail,

41:13.588 --> 41:17.217
The science community
was stunned.

41:17.300 --> 41:21.096
How could these animals
be living in these toxic chemicals,

41:21.138 --> 41:24.641
at these pressures,
around extremes of temperature

41:24.725 --> 41:28.604
from freezing to beyond boiling
in just a few inches?

41:31.357 --> 41:36.362
How could there be a whole ecosystem
living without sunlight?

41:38.656 --> 41:42.202
And not just living,
but thriving!

41:45.873 --> 41:48.000
Unbelievable,

41:48.083 --> 41:52.922
This is the most insane
amount of biomass I ever saw in my life,

41:52.963 --> 41:54.548
Wow,

41:54.632 --> 41:57.093
Holy pancakes, Batman,

42:05.185 --> 42:10.274
And they're right there in the flow,
just enjoying the hydrothermal fluid,

42:10.357 --> 42:13.611
Oh, look at 'em swarming,
They love it in the smoke,

42:13.694 --> 42:15.696
Oh, yeah,

42:16.655 --> 42:20.743
The vents
were providing the energy for life.

42:20.827 --> 42:23.621
It was coming from chemicals
dissolved in the water,

42:23.663 --> 42:26.791
coming from inside the Earth itself.

42:26.875 --> 42:30.670
Not photosynthesis,
but chemosynthesis.

42:33.924 --> 42:38.929
It was a whole new basis for life,
one that didn't need the sun,

42:39.013 --> 42:42.058
only water and heat.

42:43.226 --> 42:46.437
That party's been going on down there
in the dark for the last billion years,

42:46.521 --> 42:48.648
and it's gonna be going on
for the next billion years,

42:48.731 --> 42:51.735
They're just doing their thing,
it's got nothing to do with us,

42:51.818 --> 42:57.824
the sun could go out tomorrow and they
wouldn't know and they wouldn't care,

42:58.867 --> 43:02.454
Exploring and discovering
ecosystems like this,

43:02.538 --> 43:07.501
which may not depend
on energy from the sun,

43:07.585 --> 43:10.338
opens up all sorts
of interesting possibilities

43:10.380 --> 43:13.967
when we think about
the search for life elsewhere.

43:16.553 --> 43:21.391
Wherever we've found liquid water
on planet Earth, we've found life.

43:21.475 --> 43:23.477
That's pretty profound.

43:25.854 --> 43:31.444
If we find liquid water elsewhere in
the solar system, are we gonna find life?

43:31.527 --> 43:34.781
We won't know
unless we start searching.

43:43.665 --> 43:48.420
In fact, NASA is planning a mission
called the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter.

43:48.462 --> 43:50.381
AKA JIMO.

43:50.422 --> 43:52.925
At 120 feet long
it's gonna be several times longer

43:53.008 --> 43:55.219
than any planetary probe
ever launched,

43:55.261 --> 44:00.975
and its nuclear reactor will power
ion engines and a big science radar.

44:08.483 --> 44:10.819
The main goal of JIMO
will be to use that radar

44:10.903 --> 44:15.074
to look down through the ice
of Jupiter's three largest moons.

44:15.157 --> 44:19.120
First, it will study Callisto,
and then it'll move to Ganymede.

44:19.161 --> 44:24.000
And these are bizarre moons,
the largest of Jupiter's 61 known moons.

44:24.083 --> 44:27.587
Callisto and Ganymede
both have crusts of ancient ice and rock

44:27.629 --> 44:31.299
that may hide oceans
miles below the surface.

44:33.927 --> 44:38.974
Further in is lo,
which is a moon of fire, not ice.

44:42.103 --> 44:46.399
Io's eccentric orbit causes it
to deform as it circles Jupiter.

44:46.482 --> 44:50.111
This intense tidal pumping
pulls at the moon like taffy,

44:50.195 --> 44:53.365
generating friction at the core
which then becomes heat,

44:53.448 --> 44:58.829
and this heat drives the solar system's
largest active volcanoes.

45:01.623 --> 45:04.210
There are constant eruptions,
rivers of lava,

45:04.293 --> 45:09.132
and volcanic plumes shooting
hundreds of miles into space.

45:20.394 --> 45:26.150
But the gem of the Jovian system, at least
as far as the search for life is concerned,

45:26.191 --> 45:27.735
is Europa.

45:27.818 --> 45:32.824
It's here where fire and ice
come together in perfect harmony.

45:34.117 --> 45:36.786
The scientific community
is relatively certain

45:36.870 --> 45:42.584
that beneath the icy, chaotic shell of
Europa, there exists a liquid water ocean,

45:42.667 --> 45:47.673
with twice the volume
of all the Earth's oceans combined.

45:47.756 --> 45:53.220
So tidal heating is working here too,
keeping that water from freezing.

45:53.262 --> 45:56.724
And possibly providing
energy for life.

45:56.807 --> 46:02.522
The same kind of life that we're finding
at the deep vents here on Earth.

46:11.281 --> 46:14.910
You see all that out there,
all that yellow and white and orange?

46:14.994 --> 46:18.289
That's just a huge
colony of microbes,

46:19.749 --> 46:24.295
This is just acres and acres
of this bacterial mass,

46:24.379 --> 46:28.425
Look at that, This could be like
a little glimpse back in time,

46:28.508 --> 46:31.928
Yeah, couple of billion years ago,

46:32.012 --> 46:34.723
Hydrothermal vents
have been on planet Earth

46:34.765 --> 46:36.975
since the oceans were formed.

46:38.143 --> 46:43.357
It may have been sites like these
around which life itself began.

46:44.775 --> 46:47.445
If we can just sort of
scoop up the top area of that,

46:47.528 --> 46:50.365
maybe a little bit of
the sediment below,

46:50.448 --> 46:51.991
Excellent,

46:52.075 --> 46:54.452
Nice sample,

46:54.494 --> 47:00.042
You can see all the stringy
little filaments that make up the mat,

47:00.542 --> 47:04.755
Extremophiles are simply
life forms that thrive in the extremes

47:04.839 --> 47:09.010
of temperature and pressure
and radiation,

47:09.093 --> 47:11.971
environments that to us are deadly.

47:13.932 --> 47:20.021
These microbes go far beyond anything
which our imagination could conceive of

47:20.105 --> 47:24.735
back when we first started studying
where we might find life.

47:24.818 --> 47:28.197
Now, if we find anything on Europa,
it's probably gonna look just like this,

47:28.259 --> 47:30.428
Absolutely,

47:33.265 --> 47:36.602
So I think if we're gonna try to get
evidence for life on another planet,

47:36.643 --> 47:40.022
we've certainly gotta look
for evidence for life on our own first,

47:40.105 --> 47:41.541
It's the only sample
we've got, right?

47:41.565 --> 47:45.069
Pan Conrad. She was
one of our senior astrobiologists.

47:45.111 --> 47:47.321
She comes from
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

47:47.405 --> 47:51.910
and she's one of those valuable people
who knows how to make science fun.

47:55.121 --> 47:59.042
So you know when you were little, and you
used to play like you were in a submarine?

47:59.126 --> 48:01.086
That was this,

48:02.129 --> 48:06.258
How cool is this?
This is way better than the cardboard box,

48:19.856 --> 48:22.568
Tolya, just see
if you can ease in on this structure,

48:22.651 --> 48:25.237
Absolutely,

48:25.320 --> 48:31.118
It's just like the Mushroom Planet,
It looks exactly like a mushroom,

48:36.833 --> 48:40.628
Ah, that's gorgeous,
It's like a mirror,

48:47.094 --> 48:50.889
That's the hot water
forming a surface,

48:50.973 --> 48:53.142
That is very cool,

48:54.185 --> 48:57.104
See the bacteria growing right along
the edge, right in the hot flow?

48:57.188 --> 49:00.024
I see it,

49:00.108 --> 49:02.902
It's all bacterial mats on top,

49:04.863 --> 49:07.449
Certain molecules
found in living organisms

49:07.532 --> 49:11.745
will glow when they're hit
with an ultraviolet laser.

49:11.829 --> 49:13.831
Is that a good place
for a fluorometer reading?

49:13.914 --> 49:18.002
I think this is a great place
for a fluorometer reading,

49:18.544 --> 49:21.255
We designed
our life detection tool in such a way

49:21.339 --> 49:24.008
that we could point it
at a rock and say:

49:24.092 --> 49:27.929
"Aha! There's evidence
of life over there."

49:28.513 --> 49:30.515
Lights out,

49:31.516 --> 49:35.521
OK, I'm going to start
the measurement now, Ready...

49:35.604 --> 49:36.605
Go,

49:36.688 --> 49:39.525
OK, Lasers firing,

49:39.566 --> 49:41.902
We got a lot of signal here,

49:41.986 --> 49:45.072
Whoo, this is good, We've got,
like, 14,000 counts in ultraviolet,

49:45.156 --> 49:48.201
Very interesting, Doctor, But is it life?

49:48.242 --> 49:52.330
There's definitely organic stuff there,

49:53.498 --> 49:55.750
It's so important
to study what you can

49:55.834 --> 49:58.045
about extreme environments
on the Earth

49:58.086 --> 50:03.008
before you go out
into the solar system and look for life.

50:09.515 --> 50:11.350
MIR Two, do you copy?

50:13.353 --> 50:14.395
Go for it, Ares.

50:14.479 --> 50:19.776
My name is Kelly Snook.
I work at NASA. I'm a planetary scientist.

50:19.860 --> 50:20.944
Copy that,

50:21.027 --> 50:24.323
I study the process of exploration.

50:24.406 --> 50:26.825
Rover Two and MIR Two...

50:28.160 --> 50:30.705
What I do in my day-to-day work

50:30.788 --> 50:38.296
is learn how to use the Earth as a training
ground for going to another planet.

50:38.379 --> 50:41.091
So here
I was looking for the analogs.

50:41.174 --> 50:43.760
Baboom! You did it,

50:43.802 --> 50:46.888
- It's in the basket,
- Slam dunk,

50:46.972 --> 50:49.224
Slam dunk from the center line,

50:51.226 --> 50:55.982
These, I thought these were bacterial,
so I told Anatoly to pick some up,

50:56.023 --> 50:58.985
Most people were on a ship,
in the middle of the ocean,

50:59.026 --> 51:02.197
studying the hydrothermal vents
or making a film.

51:02.280 --> 51:03.907
I was on Mars.

51:03.990 --> 51:06.451
And the people that were
down at the bottom of the ocean,

51:06.534 --> 51:09.454
they were out on
the surface of Mars.

51:14.460 --> 51:18.839
Everything that we do in the ocean is ten
times harder than you think it's going to be,

51:18.881 --> 51:21.884
and you go in thinking
it's gonna be really hard, you know?

51:21.968 --> 51:24.345
- So I don't see Mars surface ops...
- Same with space,

51:24.429 --> 51:25.972
being any different,

51:26.014 --> 51:29.851
Yeah, hopefully we'll have time in that day
to sort of debug our comm protocols

51:29.893 --> 51:31.162
and the way we're interacting...

51:31.186 --> 51:34.564
My team included
astronaut Megan McArthur

51:34.648 --> 51:36.984
from NASA Johnson Space Center,

51:37.025 --> 51:42.239
and astrobiologist Tori Hoehler
from NASA Ames Research Center.

51:43.866 --> 51:48.287
We worked together to explore ways
in which humans and technologies

51:48.371 --> 51:53.626
can improve the science and discoveries
we'll make on the Moon and Mars.

51:55.378 --> 51:58.715
This combination
of science and technology,

51:58.757 --> 52:02.344
especially in an environment
like under the ocean,

52:02.386 --> 52:05.806
it's very similar to space exploration.

52:06.682 --> 52:09.894
The submersible is like
a pressurized rover on Mars,

52:09.977 --> 52:15.900
and so we were using this as an
opportunity to learn lessons about space.

52:15.984 --> 52:17.068
Go ahead, Roberto,

52:17.152 --> 52:22.824
If you can find any
microbial mats right near the chimney...

52:22.908 --> 52:27.287
Uh, I guess that depends on how we're
able to configure the MIRs, and how...

52:27.371 --> 52:30.374
I would talk to
the remote scientists at NASA,

52:30.416 --> 52:34.670
and I would get their requests
for particular rocks,

52:34.754 --> 52:38.424
and I would process the rocks
and prepare to take them back to Earth.

52:38.508 --> 52:40.802
I think it's probably
loaded with bacteria,

52:40.885 --> 52:45.015
I think the white stuff is most likely,
like I say, sulfur oxidizers,

52:46.266 --> 52:48.602
Analogs like this
are key to understanding

52:48.644 --> 52:53.357
how we'll do scientific exploration
on the Moon and Mars.

52:56.611 --> 53:01.240
Will we need manipulators,
like we have on the MIR? Probably.

53:01.950 --> 53:04.744
And how will we handle
the problems and technical glitches

53:04.828 --> 53:09.040
that no doubt we will have
on an extended planetary mission?

53:09.124 --> 53:11.501
Whatever you just switched off
you better switch back on,

53:11.585 --> 53:13.045
Right,

53:13.128 --> 53:14.922
Rover One and MIR One,

53:14.963 --> 53:20.594
be advised we have lost
our starboard horizontal thruster,

53:20.678 --> 53:24.223
Uh, we've lost AC
and we have lost pan and tilt,

53:24.307 --> 53:27.143
so we're probably
gonna have to abort,

53:28.144 --> 53:30.939
Every event here,
both planned and unplanned,

53:30.981 --> 53:34.609
generates data
we can apply to the future.

53:36.987 --> 53:40.491
Much of what I study is
how humans interact with the technology

53:40.574 --> 53:43.160
that allows them
to accomplish their tasks.

53:43.244 --> 53:45.413
Some of the technology
is very simple,

53:45.496 --> 53:50.209
but in space and at the bottom
of the ocean, nothing is simple.

53:51.211 --> 53:52.837
Yes!

53:52.921 --> 53:54.089
Oh...

53:56.383 --> 53:58.051
Is it gonna go? No!

53:58.135 --> 54:00.137
Ay...

54:01.221 --> 54:04.266
- You can't rotate the scoop more?
- It's on the edge of this carousel,

54:04.350 --> 54:06.352
You can put it in,

54:06.435 --> 54:08.604
- Can you rotate the scoop?
- I did, I did,

54:08.688 --> 54:11.691
- It's in?
- One piece has gone inside,

54:11.774 --> 54:15.945
Yeah? OK, good, All right, you got it,
You got it, One is out, one is in,

54:16.029 --> 54:19.157
The better we can integrate
technology like this, and robotics,

54:19.199 --> 54:21.618
into our human exploration systems,

54:21.701 --> 54:26.373
the more effectively we'll be able
to explore the solar system.

54:26.457 --> 54:28.959
- I feel like I'm in a spacecraft,
- I'm sorry?

54:29.043 --> 54:31.337
- I said, I feel like I'm in a spacecraft,
- You are,

54:31.378 --> 54:32.922
- That's right,
- You are in...

54:33.005 --> 54:37.677
- Inner space,
- the world's best spacecraft,

54:37.760 --> 54:40.346
to explore this planet,
You're in it,

54:42.098 --> 54:46.186
The experience of human beings
inside the submersible

54:46.269 --> 54:48.981
is what we're most interested in.

54:51.984 --> 54:55.362
It's Marge,
It's Marge Simpson's hairdo,

54:57.490 --> 54:59.700
It's not only
the hardware in the process,

54:59.784 --> 55:03.413
but the communications
between the people and the robots,

55:03.496 --> 55:06.625
because the scientist is
the interface between the technology

55:06.708 --> 55:08.919
and what we're trying to study.

55:09.002 --> 55:12.297
OK, guys, what I'd like you
to do is come to your right

55:12.381 --> 55:15.509
when you've had a look at that, 'cause
we're not getting much of an image here.

55:15.592 --> 55:18.095
And the current
is of course not favorable,

55:18.179 --> 55:22.517
That's OK,
It wouldn't be fun if it was easy, right?

55:25.561 --> 55:28.815
- What's that fish?
- It's a big fish. Don't be scared.

55:31.943 --> 55:34.738
If you want to take a sample
of any of these small sulfide rocks

55:34.821 --> 55:36.615
down here at the bottom,
that would be fine.

55:36.698 --> 55:39.284
It's a very
technologically difficult thing to do,

55:39.368 --> 55:41.453
to pick up a rock
at the bottom of the ocean

55:41.537 --> 55:43.873
and put it into
a sample collection device.

55:43.956 --> 55:46.018
That's really at the core
of what we're interested in.

55:46.042 --> 55:50.505
How are humans going to do these small,
easy tasks in a difficult environment?

55:50.588 --> 55:54.759
Whoa, we got currents,
Come on, gripper, Grip,

55:54.801 --> 55:56.970
It's got it.

55:59.431 --> 56:02.392
Oh! Hang onto it, baby,

56:02.810 --> 56:05.354
All right, you got it,
Barely got it, but you got it,

56:05.437 --> 56:07.606
OK, try to get it over to the carousel,

56:07.648 --> 56:09.775
Well, a task
that would take a person in the field

56:09.859 --> 56:14.155
a couple of minutes on Earth
can take hours on Mars.

56:14.238 --> 56:16.658
Every step is a new challenge.

56:17.784 --> 56:23.081
Now translate right just a little bit.
About another two inches.

56:24.499 --> 56:30.506
We can't send 150 people to Mars
right away. We would send probably six.

56:37.055 --> 56:39.349
These few people will be responsible

56:39.432 --> 56:42.352
for all the science
and exploration on the surface.

56:42.435 --> 56:45.856
Kind of like proxies for
the thousands of people back on Earth

56:45.939 --> 56:47.649
interested in the mission.

56:50.360 --> 56:53.822
Mars is the obvious first place
to look for life in the solar system,

56:53.906 --> 56:56.867
because there's evidence
that the Earth and Mars

56:56.951 --> 57:00.121
share a similar history
of abundant water.

57:00.204 --> 57:05.877
And one of the most important key
elements of life as we know it is water.

57:07.462 --> 57:13.260
Now, the Mars you see today
is dry, dusty, cold, apparently dead.

57:13.343 --> 57:18.224
But if you set the way-back machine,
it didn't look like that.

57:19.558 --> 57:22.436
If you could imagine
if life was evolving on Mars,

57:22.520 --> 57:25.106
and there was an impact great enough...

57:33.573 --> 57:36.493
based on what we know now
about extremophiles,

57:36.577 --> 57:42.291
we think that life could survive
a trip from Mars to Earth in a rock.

57:42.374 --> 57:47.713
It's possible that life
could be viable after that long of a trip.

57:51.426 --> 57:57.599
We might all be Martians. We might all
be from another solar system entirely.

57:59.685 --> 58:04.273
All right, Put up your hand if you would
sacrifice ten years of your life to go to Mars,

58:04.356 --> 58:06.358
- I'm going,
- Sure,

58:07.943 --> 58:12.115
How would you talk your husband
into letting you go to Mars?

58:12.198 --> 58:15.743
Say, "All right, honey, Now,
it's only gonna be for five years, OK?"

58:15.827 --> 58:19.289
"And I'm gonna write every day,
we'll have email,"

58:19.372 --> 58:22.584
Whoa,
That's a loaded question there,

58:22.626 --> 58:25.587
It's funny, 'cause when you asked me
the question, "Would I go to Mars?"

58:25.629 --> 58:32.553
I raised my hand without even thinking
about the consequences or life at home,

58:32.636 --> 58:35.973
My husband, my cat,
my mom and dad...

58:36.057 --> 58:38.768
My cat,

58:39.269 --> 58:42.480
That'd be hard,
I think he'd say, "Go for it," I really do,

58:42.564 --> 58:46.777
'Cause I think all of us, we're all human
and we all have that exploration bug,

58:46.860 --> 58:49.613
and if somebody that we love
has the opportunity to go out there

58:49.696 --> 58:55.619
and represent humanity and explore,
I think he'd push me and go for it,

58:58.998 --> 59:01.459
When you've been on the
"Keldysh" for almost a month,

59:01.542 --> 59:05.296
it's very easy to pretend
that you're on your way to Mars.

59:07.882 --> 59:10.427
You're far away
from everything you know,

59:10.510 --> 59:13.722
in a small environment
with the same crew,

59:13.805 --> 59:17.977
who are there for the same
professional interests that you are.

59:18.018 --> 59:20.688
They're there to explore,
they're there to do science.

59:25.610 --> 59:27.445
The Russians are very resourceful.

59:27.528 --> 59:29.381
They were showing us
some of their sampling tools,

59:29.405 --> 59:33.368
and they have a tool that can sample
just about anything you'd want to sample.

59:33.451 --> 59:36.413
Some of the things are really clever.

59:36.496 --> 59:38.665
Or as simple as the Nikolai pot,

59:38.707 --> 59:42.586
which is basically a pot
we stole from the cook, Nikolai.

59:46.215 --> 59:49.635
It's something that
I just love getting to be a part of.

59:49.719 --> 59:52.889
You know, we get to be in their culture,
and look at how they do engineering

59:52.972 --> 59:54.724
and how they do operations.

59:54.808 --> 59:58.103
It's an incredible environment
to be working in.

59:59.813 --> 01:00:02.733
I love it because of
the way it brings people together.

01:00:02.774 --> 01:00:04.360
Victor,

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:07.363
Obed?

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:09.907
Your... Your lunch?

01:00:09.991 --> 01:00:12.243
- Yeah,
- Yes, that's right,

01:00:12.326 --> 01:00:13.494
Yeah? Yay!

01:00:13.578 --> 01:00:16.873
This expedition
captured a lot of that spirit.

01:00:16.915 --> 01:00:18.541
OK, all right,

01:00:18.625 --> 01:00:21.586
The idea of doing something
that was really difficult,

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:25.716
and how people can come together
to make something like that happen.

01:00:25.799 --> 01:00:27.384
Poyehaly.

01:00:27.926 --> 01:00:30.221
The way they communicate
with each other.

01:00:30.262 --> 01:00:32.014
No, forward,

01:00:41.649 --> 01:00:43.860
Victor's been practicing,

01:00:44.819 --> 01:00:47.781
Vitka, khorosho, khorosho.

01:00:49.616 --> 01:00:51.910
One of the things
I enjoy about Russian culture

01:00:51.952 --> 01:00:54.788
is the way that
you integrate play and work.

01:00:54.872 --> 01:00:55.664
Vosem-pyaty.

01:00:55.748 --> 01:00:57.833
I mean,
I've studied Russian in college,

01:00:57.917 --> 01:01:01.838
because I always wanted to work
with the Russian space program.

01:01:01.921 --> 01:01:07.802
And the "Keldysh" is a great analog for,
you know, a space launch complex.

01:01:07.886 --> 01:01:11.181
And I understood what
all the astronauts are always saying,

01:01:11.264 --> 01:01:14.810
when they say that the technicians
and the engineers on the pad

01:01:14.893 --> 01:01:18.647
are the real heroes,
making sure that you're gonna be safe.

01:01:18.731 --> 01:01:22.735
This expedition
captured a lot of that spirit.

01:01:22.818 --> 01:01:24.779
Engines start.

01:01:29.242 --> 01:01:31.828
While we were out at sea,
two incredible explorers

01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:34.706
were already on their way to Mars.

01:01:35.916 --> 01:01:42.339
"Spirit" got there first, blazing into the
thin Martian atmosphere at over 12,000mph.

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:49.931
"Opportunity" arrived
a few weeks later.

01:01:50.723 --> 01:01:54.394
Landing for both
was a nerve-racking affair.

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:58.231
Current altitude approximately 25,000 feet.

01:01:58.315 --> 01:02:00.901
Awaiting confirmation.

01:02:00.984 --> 01:02:05.155
We're moving at a speed of 173 miles per
hour. We are near our terminal velocity.

01:02:05.197 --> 01:02:07.825
Cleaner separation of end
has been detected.

01:02:22.466 --> 01:02:23.884
No signal at the moment.

01:02:23.967 --> 01:02:30.391
Deep-space network tracking stations at
Canberra searching for primary signal.

01:02:31.767 --> 01:02:34.437
We're on Mars, everybody.

01:02:42.487 --> 01:02:45.198
Equipped with
high-resolution stereoscopic cameras,

01:02:45.282 --> 01:02:47.409
and a Swiss army knife's
worth of geological

01:02:47.492 --> 01:02:49.369
and chemical science instruments,

01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:52.748
the mission of
the Mars Exploration Rovers was clear:

01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:55.835
Find evidence of water in Mars' past,

01:02:55.918 --> 01:03:00.256
when conditions
may have been more favorable to life.

01:03:05.595 --> 01:03:09.724
You can learn a lot from a rock,
if you know how to ask.

01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:12.894
And you know where to look.

01:03:15.689 --> 01:03:20.194
Of the two rovers,
"Opportunity" really hit the jackpot.

01:03:20.277 --> 01:03:23.656
The ancient bedrock
was absolutely loaded with hematite,

01:03:23.739 --> 01:03:28.786
an iron-bearing mineral that usually
forms from interaction with liquid water.

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:30.914
Then scientists detected jarosite,

01:03:30.955 --> 01:03:34.918
a mineral that suggests the rocks may
have been soaked in acid ground water,

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:40.299
or in a hot springs environment,
like Yellowstone National Park.

01:03:43.344 --> 01:03:46.639
Other clues included
empty cavities inside rocks,

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:49.308
where salt crystals
may have dissolved away,

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.894
and rippled sediment patterns,

01:03:51.978 --> 01:03:57.442
hinting at the presence of free-flowing
water over thousands of years.

01:03:58.485 --> 01:04:02.447
And then there were the "blueberries."
Tiny spheres of hematite,

01:04:02.489 --> 01:04:06.076
eroded out of the rocks
and spilled out all over the surface.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:11.791
On Earth, spheres like this form
in the presence of water over time.

01:04:11.832 --> 01:04:16.462
Both "Spirit" and "Opportunity" helped
confirm where the water was on Mars,

01:04:16.504 --> 01:04:21.092
but they were not equipped
to tell us where the water is now.

01:04:21.176 --> 01:04:23.804
That job fell to
the Mars Odyssey Orbiter,

01:04:23.887 --> 01:04:27.599
which detected what is believed
to be massive quantities of water ice,

01:04:27.683 --> 01:04:34.148
just a few feet below the surface, with
the highest concentrations at the poles.

01:04:35.316 --> 01:04:40.572
In 2008, "Phoenix" will rise
from the ashes of the Mars Polar Lander,

01:04:40.655 --> 01:04:43.158
and, using many of that
failed mission's spare parts,

01:04:43.241 --> 01:04:46.369
will land near the Martian north pole.

01:04:48.497 --> 01:04:51.166
And, for the first time ever,

01:04:51.917 --> 01:04:56.255
a Martian probe will do more
than scratch the surface.

01:04:57.673 --> 01:05:01.052
"Phoenix" will dig deep
into the permafrost

01:05:01.135 --> 01:05:04.597
and sample Martian water
for the very first time.

01:05:06.891 --> 01:05:10.187
Everything we learn about Mars
makes the story more exciting.

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:14.107
There's evidence of past water,
there's evidence of past volcanism,

01:05:14.191 --> 01:05:15.859
the chemistry checks out.

01:05:15.943 --> 01:05:20.948
All the ingredients for life are there.
That's why we keep searching.

01:05:22.033 --> 01:05:25.870
Of course, that's not the only way
we're searching for life in the universe.

01:05:25.912 --> 01:05:27.997
- Look at this, he's computer coordinated,
- I know,

01:05:28.081 --> 01:05:32.794
It says, "SETI Institute"
on your shirt and on your laptop,

01:05:32.877 --> 01:05:35.005
- It's a little over the top,
- That's impressive,

01:05:35.088 --> 01:05:38.425
- You're putting the message out there,
- Well, you know, they gave it to me,

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:40.385
One of the groups
I'm affiliated with

01:05:40.427 --> 01:05:44.765
is the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence Institute.

01:05:44.849 --> 01:05:49.520
And what the SETI Institute does
is try to detect intelligent signals

01:05:49.604 --> 01:05:54.067
from distant civilizations
around another star.

01:05:54.108 --> 01:05:58.238
To do this, Frank Drake,
one of the founders of the SETI Institute,

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.992
wrote down just a set of factors
known as the Drake Equation.

01:06:02.075 --> 01:06:08.082
And it includes factors such as the fraction
of stars around which planets form,

01:06:08.165 --> 01:06:12.795
the fraction of habitable planets
on which life emerges,

01:06:13.796 --> 01:06:18.635
and the fraction of life
that then evolves to intelligence,

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:24.433
and eventually to becoming
tool-using civilizations

01:06:24.474 --> 01:06:28.437
that can communicate with
other civilizations in the galaxy.

01:06:35.027 --> 01:06:40.909
The last factor is the lifetime of the
intelligent communicating civilization.

01:06:40.992 --> 01:06:44.120
At the same time
that we develop the technology

01:06:44.204 --> 01:06:47.415
to communicate
with beings on a distant planet,

01:06:47.499 --> 01:06:51.712
we also develop the technology
to annihilate ourselves.

01:06:51.795 --> 01:06:57.176
And if that's standard for intelligent
civilizations in the galaxy,

01:06:57.218 --> 01:07:01.305
we're not going to have much luck
searching for life elsewhere.

01:07:03.057 --> 01:07:06.519
Let's say that my
kind of modified Drake's Equation

01:07:06.603 --> 01:07:09.856
says that life was possible on any planet,
any distance from a sun,

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.485
or not even anywhere near a sun,
or any planetarylike body,

01:07:13.527 --> 01:07:17.448
like a moon of Jupiter or whatever,
that had ice around it, OK?

01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:21.827
And had some kind of tidal pumping
from some other gravity source near it,

01:07:21.869 --> 01:07:24.163
so that it had a liquid core
and it was generating heat,

01:07:24.205 --> 01:07:28.292
and it was making heat like these
hydrothermal vents that we're seeing,

01:07:28.376 --> 01:07:33.632
If we said there were maybe ten or twenty
or fifty times as many worlds like that,

01:07:33.715 --> 01:07:39.054
isn't it logical to assume that when we get
a call from one of your buddies out there,

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:41.932
when SETI Institute
finally picks up a signal,

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:45.519
it's gonna be coming from somebody
who had to bore up through ice

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.855
and set their transmitter
out on the ice?

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:52.110
Statistically, isn't that indicated
by what we're talking about here?

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:55.780
There's a flaw in that statement,
and that is: Ice worlds are most common,

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:58.950
We have no idea
about that right now,

01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:01.328
We got one liquid water planet
in our solar system,

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:05.749
and we've already identified
three potential hydrospheres

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:09.295
- that are ice-covered and far
from the sun, - Right, But...

01:08:09.378 --> 01:08:12.298
Based on our own immediate experience,
it's a three-to-one ratio,

01:08:12.381 --> 01:08:15.551
Sure, sure,
Do we know if any of them are habitable?

01:08:15.593 --> 01:08:18.513
- We don't, but we gotta go look,
- Right,

01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:24.770
We may find that
icy little worlds like Europa

01:08:24.810 --> 01:08:29.149
are where the bulk
of liquid water exists in our galaxy.

01:08:29.233 --> 01:08:33.404
And, in fact,
that's where the bulk of life may exist.

01:08:33.444 --> 01:08:35.448
Who knows?

01:08:35.531 --> 01:08:40.453
But it is really interesting to think
about the evolution of intelligence

01:08:40.536 --> 01:08:43.581
in an icy world system.

01:08:43.622 --> 01:08:45.709
Would you evolve to intelligence?

01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:49.921
Would you wonder about
the bottom of that ice shell?

01:08:54.969 --> 01:08:58.096
Our primary focus at this site
will be for the mussels and the crabs,

01:08:58.139 --> 01:09:00.951
OK, And you need mussels and crabs, and
we're gonna do the crabs in a crab trap?

01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:02.435
We're gonna do crab traps,

01:09:02.518 --> 01:09:06.356
So we're hoping that whatever we fix
in the crab trap will trap these guys,

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:08.608
Now, do you care
where we put the crab trap?

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:11.361
Preferably where there's crabs,

01:09:14.113 --> 01:09:18.993
Yes, we're currently at
X coordinates minus 106,

01:09:19.078 --> 01:09:22.540
Y coordinates minus 76. Over.

01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:27.252
The story of the vents
is really the story of the microbes.

01:09:27.336 --> 01:09:29.339
This is it, right here,

01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:33.885
Bottom of the food chain,
Waving fields of bacteria,

01:09:38.515 --> 01:09:40.850
The vent fluid is a kind
of liquid sunshine,

01:09:40.934 --> 01:09:44.438
powering the whole
food chain down here.

01:09:45.564 --> 01:09:48.359
Some of the animals
are eating the bacteria,

01:09:48.442 --> 01:09:53.072
some of them are preying
on the ones that eat the bacteria.

01:09:55.867 --> 01:09:58.536
It's kind of ethereal, huh?

01:09:59.704 --> 01:10:04.334
Who would have thought
that bacteria could be beautiful?

01:10:11.759 --> 01:10:13.553
The animals
are eating the bacteria,

01:10:13.636 --> 01:10:16.848
but there's something else
going on here too.

01:10:16.931 --> 01:10:22.395
It's symbiosis, a dance of life
between partners of different species.

01:10:23.188 --> 01:10:25.315
Vent animals,
like the shrimp and the mussels,

01:10:25.399 --> 01:10:28.235
have formed
symbiotic relationships with microbes

01:10:28.318 --> 01:10:30.863
that can live off of
the chemicals in the vent fluid.

01:10:30.904 --> 01:10:33.032
Oh, we're near
something big, guys,

01:10:33.073 --> 01:10:36.243
Large mussel beds,
This is the jackpot,

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:42.166
I study the metabolic
and molecular physiology

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:46.004
of mussels and crabs
that live at these deep sea vents.

01:10:47.088 --> 01:10:50.717
I'm focusing on their ability
to withstand variations,

01:10:50.759 --> 01:10:53.137
large variations, in temperature.

01:10:57.933 --> 01:10:59.977
The genus Bathymodiolus

01:11:00.061 --> 01:11:03.481
is the scientific name
for the mussels that we study.

01:11:03.564 --> 01:11:06.234
We've got a mussel mound
over to the right, Genya,

01:11:06.276 --> 01:11:09.821
I think this will be a perfect spot
to do our mussel collections,

01:11:09.904 --> 01:11:12.824
- Yes,
- You see what I'm talking about?

01:11:12.908 --> 01:11:16.078
I think these are mixed sizes,
Or can you get some small ones?

01:11:16.119 --> 01:11:20.332
- We will take small and big also,
- But I need small,

01:11:20.416 --> 01:11:22.042
- Only small?
- Only small,

01:11:22.126 --> 01:11:25.296
- OK,
- Malinky. Yeah? Is that small?

01:11:25.379 --> 01:11:26.798
- Yes,
- OK,

01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:28.883
All right,

01:11:32.387 --> 01:11:34.723
Keldysh, Keldysh, MIR One,

01:11:34.806 --> 01:11:39.394
We have collected a full batch
of mussels in the clam bucket,

01:11:39.478 --> 01:11:44.942
X minus 487, Y minus 64,

01:11:48.195 --> 01:11:50.781
Oh, yeah! Bingo, baby,

01:11:58.415 --> 01:12:00.709
Looks like you got your crabs,

01:12:02.461 --> 01:12:08.467
Yes. We got crabs.
Big time. It's, like, full.

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:11.095
You did it, you did it!

01:12:19.896 --> 01:12:22.399
Bio box is closed,
We have crabbage,

01:12:23.567 --> 01:12:26.695
We have crabbage.

01:12:48.385 --> 01:12:50.512
- Wanna open that?
- Yeah,

01:12:51.638 --> 01:12:54.308
My PhD advisor is Jim Childress.

01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:56.852
He's been studying
hydrothermal vent communities

01:12:56.894 --> 01:13:00.356
since their discovery
in the late 1970s.

01:13:00.898 --> 01:13:03.818
And he has years of experience
going to sea and doing science

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:06.738
in these extreme environments.

01:13:08.406 --> 01:13:11.117
So the Childress lab
is one of the only labs in the world

01:13:11.201 --> 01:13:13.995
that's able to keep
these animals and maintain them

01:13:14.079 --> 01:13:18.208
in an environment similar
to what they come from.

01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:24.507
As fast as we can,
we take the animals that were collected

01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:25.967
and bring them into our lab,

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:30.513
where we place them
in a maintenance respirometry system.

01:13:32.182 --> 01:13:35.435
We call this thing "the condo."

01:13:35.518 --> 01:13:38.230
We put the animals in
these little condos,

01:13:38.271 --> 01:13:42.484
we repressurize them up to
the pressure that they were collected in,

01:13:42.568 --> 01:13:46.697
and we make sure that
we have them back at the temperature

01:13:46.781 --> 01:13:49.951
that is optimal for their survival.

01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:53.830
Then we pick some of the animals
to use for our experiments,

01:13:53.913 --> 01:13:56.124
and we transfer them
into another system

01:13:56.207 --> 01:13:58.627
that's called
the high-pressure respirometry system.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:14:02.214
Now, this system
is extremely unique and special,

01:14:02.297 --> 01:14:05.968
because here we can manipulate
the environmental conditions,

01:14:06.051 --> 01:14:10.181
and we look at
the metabolic rates of the animals

01:14:10.264 --> 01:14:15.144
as we vary their environmental condition,
and that's what I love to study.

01:14:16.312 --> 01:14:19.315
By looking at mussels,
you can gain a better understanding

01:14:19.399 --> 01:14:23.320
about temperature adaptation,
and that might help us in the future

01:14:23.361 --> 01:14:26.948
when it comes to
the warming of our planet.

01:14:27.991 --> 01:14:30.119
Global warming is real.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.582
It's putting our planet at risk,
life as we know it, not just species.

01:14:34.665 --> 01:14:38.336
I mean the whole food chain,
the whole ecosystem.

01:14:38.419 --> 01:14:41.631
And at some point
we're gonna have to deal with it.

01:14:44.425 --> 01:14:49.389
I think I got into the ocean
because it's mysterious to me,

01:14:49.473 --> 01:14:51.850
it's unknown.

01:14:51.892 --> 01:14:56.355
It's not explored,
it hasn't been conquered,

01:14:56.438 --> 01:15:00.401
and I appreciate it,
and I have respect for it.

01:15:00.484 --> 01:15:01.837
Did you ever think
you'd end up here?

01:15:01.861 --> 01:15:03.988
Oh, God, no.

01:15:04.530 --> 01:15:08.493
But I guess this is the path
of questions that I tried to answer,

01:15:08.535 --> 01:15:12.581
which has led me on a path
that ended up here,

01:15:12.664 --> 01:15:14.517
And so now the question
that I'm trying to answer

01:15:14.541 --> 01:15:18.545
has me taking submarines
down to the bottom of the ocean,

01:15:44.698 --> 01:15:48.577
OK, let's, uh...
Let the meeting come to order,

01:15:48.661 --> 01:15:50.788
The dive will be Snake Pit,

01:15:50.872 --> 01:15:56.878
The pilots will be Dr, Anatoly Sagalevitch,
MIR One, Genya Chernaiev, MIR Two,

01:15:58.296 --> 01:16:01.049
We find a structure
that we can work the 'bot,

01:16:01.091 --> 01:16:08.057
So we'll land at the base and we'll just
try to work up through the structure,

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.392
ideally up all the way to a chimney,

01:16:10.476 --> 01:16:14.855
There is not supposed to be
too much hot venting on the wall,

01:16:14.939 --> 01:16:16.023
some shimmering water,

01:16:16.107 --> 01:16:19.235
but I don't think the hot vents happen
until way at the top, is that correct?

01:16:19.277 --> 01:16:22.864
The best way to visualize this stuff
is wherever you see something black,

01:16:22.947 --> 01:16:24.574
that's like a blowtorch,

01:16:24.658 --> 01:16:27.619
That's, you know,
a blowtorch made out of water,

01:16:36.462 --> 01:16:38.256
OK, there's MIR One,

01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:42.969
They're coming up
with us, aren't they?

01:16:43.011 --> 01:16:45.346
You're about halfway
up the structure right now,

01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:49.434
so if you just work your way
forward along the wall.

01:16:49.476 --> 01:16:51.645
Copy that.

01:16:59.487 --> 01:17:05.368
There's an antler-shaped stone bowl
that's filled with juvenile "Rimicaris."

01:17:05.451 --> 01:17:07.328
Roger that,

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:10.123
All right, This is, I think,
the structure he was describing,

01:17:10.206 --> 01:17:13.293
and I think I can get in
a little closer to it,

01:17:13.835 --> 01:17:15.837
That's it,
You should see 'em now, Over,

01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:18.215
- Got it,
- Oh, wow,

01:17:18.298 --> 01:17:20.300
Copy that, We see it,

01:17:22.511 --> 01:17:25.181
These little shrimp are different,
Are these related?

01:17:25.264 --> 01:17:28.059
Yes, Juvenile and adults,

01:17:30.144 --> 01:17:32.772
The vent shrimp, "Rimicaris exoculata,"

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:36.610
are grazing on the bacteria
growing all around them.

01:17:36.693 --> 01:17:39.821
- Are you seeing this crab?
- I sure am,

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:46.829
Look at 'em, They're eating the bacteria
that's growing all over that crab,

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:50.082
Oh, he almost got that guy,
Look at that,

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.293
He's all covered with this bacteria,

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:56.965
He doesn't know it, he just thinks
the shrimp are picking on him,

01:17:57.966 --> 01:18:02.095
It's like crab-fu here
at the bottom of the ocean,

01:18:02.179 --> 01:18:04.032
- The shrimp colony, There you go,
- There it is,

01:18:04.056 --> 01:18:06.558
- Let's check that guy out,
- OK,

01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:13.107
- This is black smoke,
- Look at these guys,

01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:15.818
I can't believe they're
swimming in and out of it,

01:18:15.902 --> 01:18:18.863
Oops, Aah! It's hot,

01:18:18.905 --> 01:18:20.883
OK, if it's not cooking them,
it's not gonna cook me,

01:18:20.907 --> 01:18:23.368
So I'm gonna move in a little closer,

01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:25.537
Being bold,

01:18:31.919 --> 01:18:35.881
- Now let's get out, Back out,
- I've got full back command,

01:18:35.923 --> 01:18:37.550
- What the heck?
- All right,

01:18:37.591 --> 01:18:39.403
- They're attached to us,
- Let's stay away from that,

01:18:39.427 --> 01:18:41.554
- They're on us,
- They're attacking us!

01:18:41.637 --> 01:18:45.350
Lookit, the shrimp love him,
They're all over him,

01:18:45.433 --> 01:18:48.144
The shrimp are loving Jake,
Check that out,

01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:50.230
Look at that,

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:55.360
Oh, wow, Oh, my goodness,
I can't even see the fly,

01:18:55.444 --> 01:18:57.404
I just see shrimp,

01:19:00.324 --> 01:19:02.618
Yeah, looks like
we've got some piggybackers,

01:19:02.702 --> 01:19:06.122
some shrimp that are
along for the ride, Over,

01:19:07.123 --> 01:19:10.418
Wow, That's amazing,

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:12.629
I can get shrimp at Sizzler, This...

01:19:12.712 --> 01:19:15.674
You can't get this shrimp at Sizzler,

01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:29.439
"Riftia," the giant tubeworms,

01:19:29.522 --> 01:19:33.276
are hands down
the stars of the deep vent community,

01:19:33.359 --> 01:19:37.364
and also the best example
of symbiosis in action.

01:19:40.033 --> 01:19:42.494
I've got a little bit of
shimmering water here,

01:19:42.536 --> 01:19:47.291
We should be OK,
Wow, Oh, this is gorgeous,

01:19:48.501 --> 01:19:51.045
These animals don't even have a stomach.

01:19:51.128 --> 01:19:53.589
They literally can't eat.

01:19:55.425 --> 01:19:59.346
They depend completely on
a large sac of microbes inside their body,

01:19:59.429 --> 01:20:01.640
which produces their food.

01:20:04.226 --> 01:20:08.397
When you get in really close,
you can see some pretty neat stuff,

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.649
Oh, wow,

01:20:19.534 --> 01:20:23.163
You see that guy?
Can we grab him?

01:20:23.204 --> 01:20:26.750
If you want to,
You get ready, I think we're set,

01:20:27.751 --> 01:20:29.836
On your mark...

01:20:32.381 --> 01:20:35.092
- Oh, he might come to us,
- Go,

01:20:36.886 --> 01:20:38.888
Oh!

01:20:41.098 --> 01:20:43.685
Crab got away, Tell 'em nice try,

01:20:43.768 --> 01:20:45.728
Nice try, nice try,

01:20:48.898 --> 01:20:51.735
They're gorgeous underwater,

01:20:51.777 --> 01:20:55.280
The long red plume is like a gill.

01:20:55.364 --> 01:20:59.493
It takes in oxygen,
and also nutrients from the vent fluid.

01:20:59.577 --> 01:21:02.997
The worm's job
is to keep this plume in the flow,

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:07.710
sucking in nutrients
which feed the bacteria inside.

01:21:07.752 --> 01:21:13.758
And it's the bacteria's job to convert the
sulfide chemicals into food for the worm.

01:21:15.927 --> 01:21:19.890
So the question is,
do the bacteria work for the worm,

01:21:19.973 --> 01:21:23.060
or does the worm
work for the bacteria?

01:21:25.312 --> 01:21:30.401
If these animals didn't exist,
we could not have imagined them.

01:21:31.694 --> 01:21:36.741
It makes me wonder what else
is out there, waiting to be discovered.

01:21:38.285 --> 01:21:40.954
You've got a cool job, Genya,

01:21:41.038 --> 01:21:43.040
Thank you,

01:21:46.627 --> 01:21:52.425
So the real question is, could you
imagine a colony of these on Europa?

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:54.844
Where would the oxygen
be coming from, you know?

01:21:54.927 --> 01:21:58.348
If the whole idea is they don't
need sunlight to drive this ecosystem,

01:21:58.431 --> 01:22:02.102
it's just chemosynthesis,
but they need some ambient oxygen,

01:22:02.143 --> 01:22:04.646
- The oxygen in the water came from...
- Photosynthesis,

01:22:04.730 --> 01:22:06.732
Photosynthesis
a million years ago, maybe,

01:22:06.815 --> 01:22:10.069
It doesn't matter, however long
it takes for the water to turn it over,

01:22:10.152 --> 01:22:13.781
So the question becomes,
is oxygen necessary for life?

01:22:13.864 --> 01:22:15.116
- Ah, yeah, Yeah,
- OK?

01:22:15.199 --> 01:22:20.038
It may be for large animals, OK? But if
we get down to the microbial level...

01:22:20.121 --> 01:22:21.932
- But we want to see large animals,
- You want to see large animals,

01:22:21.956 --> 01:22:25.210
We want to see large animals,
We don't want to spend all this money

01:22:25.293 --> 01:22:27.254
to go out into space and find a microbe,

01:22:27.337 --> 01:22:30.591
Oh, come on, microbes are great,
You know, they're highly underrated,

01:22:30.674 --> 01:22:34.595
But they're not good conversationalists,
I mean, look, I would want to give...

01:22:34.678 --> 01:22:38.724
Here, look, let me just go forward
to one of these cool Riftia patches...

01:22:38.808 --> 01:22:41.060
What do you think
makes life here possible?

01:22:41.144 --> 01:22:43.563
These guys have this
incredible symbiosis with microbes,

01:22:43.646 --> 01:22:45.440
Yeah, they're living on the bacteria,

01:22:45.523 --> 01:22:48.193
But I'm not gonna give
a bouquet of bacteria to my mom,

01:22:48.276 --> 01:22:50.237
but I would give her
a bouquet of these Riftia.

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.990
Look at these things,
They're beautiful,

01:22:53.073 --> 01:22:55.075
So what Jim says is right.

01:22:55.158 --> 01:23:00.623
O xygen is the afterburner that fuelled the
explosion of multicellular life on our world.

01:23:00.706 --> 01:23:04.585
And even though chemosynthesis
happens beyond the light of our sun,

01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:08.715
many of the biological processes
still require some free oxygen,

01:23:08.798 --> 01:23:15.263
and this oxygen is typically supplied from
photosynthesis at the surface of the Earth.

01:23:15.347 --> 01:23:18.684
So where might oxygen
come from on Europa?

01:23:19.685 --> 01:23:23.981
Europa's orbit sits within Jupiter's
enormous magnetic field.

01:23:24.064 --> 01:23:27.568
The intense radiation
continually slams energetic particles

01:23:27.652 --> 01:23:29.070
into the Europan surface,

01:23:29.153 --> 01:23:32.323
and has the potential
to transform vast amounts of water ice

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:37.162
into things like hydrogen peroxide
and molecular oxygen.

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:41.375
Assuming those oxidants make their way
into the ocean on a regular basis,

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:44.253
through cracks
and upwellings or comet impacts,

01:23:44.336 --> 01:23:50.634
they would represent an energy jackpot
for any life forms trying to survive there.

01:23:50.718 --> 01:23:53.387
And so this is where
some of the hydrothermal samples

01:23:53.429 --> 01:23:55.848
come into play again.

01:23:55.932 --> 01:24:01.062
We're trying to replicate the Europan
surface environment in the lab.

01:24:03.231 --> 01:24:07.611
Now, these,
these are rocks from the deep ocean,

01:24:07.694 --> 01:24:10.739
So let's prep this for the chamber,

01:24:10.781 --> 01:24:14.660
- Maybe take a little piece off of here,
- OK, sure,

01:24:14.744 --> 01:24:18.748
So this is Europa in a can,

01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:21.584
This part down here
is a vacuum chamber,

01:24:21.626 --> 01:24:25.046
We've got liquid nitrogen coming in,
and we can grow ices

01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:28.216
and basically replicate
the surface environment of Europa,

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:32.012
Then, up here,
we've got a high-energy electron gun,

01:24:32.095 --> 01:24:37.601
and what this does is replicate the radiation
environment of the Jovian magnetic field,

01:24:37.643 --> 01:24:43.149
this tremendously large
and powerful magnetic field of Jupiter,

01:24:43.232 --> 01:24:47.529
What would happen to life
exposed to that environment?

01:24:50.198 --> 01:24:54.411
We're taking microbes that we found
down at the hydrothermal vents,

01:24:54.494 --> 01:24:56.330
putting them into this environment,

01:24:56.413 --> 01:24:59.750
and bombarding them, blasting them,
with this high-energy radiation,

01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:05.131
making sort of a chemical junkyard,
a biological chemical compound junkyard,

01:25:06.799 --> 01:25:11.471
And this is sort of comparable to,
say, going to a junkyard here on Earth,

01:25:11.513 --> 01:25:15.225
and you wander around the junkyard
and you see a steering wheel and a tire,

01:25:15.308 --> 01:25:18.437
and you know that at one point
there was a complete car,

01:25:19.688 --> 01:25:23.400
When we send a spacecraft to Europa,
we're going to have to understand

01:25:23.484 --> 01:25:27.738
what are the chemical and molecular
biosignatures that are left behind?

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:31.284
Are we seeing that same
kind of signature on the surface of Europa?

01:25:31.367 --> 01:25:36.998
If we do, what does that imply
for the habitability of the ocean below?

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.514
Menez Gwen's
an underwater volcano.

01:25:53.891 --> 01:25:59.230
It's this really unique place because
you have your hydrothermal vents there,

01:25:59.314 --> 01:26:02.108
and shimmering water everywhere.

01:26:07.281 --> 01:26:10.409
- Are we digging this place?
- We're digging this place big time,

01:26:10.492 --> 01:26:11.493
Big time,

01:26:19.961 --> 01:26:22.714
Really see the clear fluids,

01:26:22.755 --> 01:26:28.345
So these are a little bit cooler, 'cause
you're not getting the black smoke here,

01:26:29.429 --> 01:26:33.350
This site has an amazing dreamlike quality.

01:26:41.359 --> 01:26:47.031
The cooler, clear vent fluid
isn't as toxic as the black smokers.

01:26:47.115 --> 01:26:50.368
So you wind up
getting a lot of visitors.

01:26:50.452 --> 01:26:53.872
Including some opportunistic predators.

01:27:08.179 --> 01:27:12.642
Oh, look at all that shimmering water
coming out of that structure,

01:27:12.726 --> 01:27:17.022
If we can collect a sample down there,
that would be fantastic,

01:27:17.105 --> 01:27:19.691
MIR One, MIR One, MIR Two,

01:27:19.775 --> 01:27:21.944
This is MIR One.
Go ahead.

01:27:21.985 --> 01:27:26.365
OK, Jim, we're ready now to launch Jake,
Ready to go now,

01:27:29.076 --> 01:27:31.829
Here we go, Coming out,

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:35.291
- Everything working OK?
- Yeah, it seems OK,

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:40.714
So getting to work with Mike
and Jake is just absolutely fantastic,

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:45.344
because you can think about this thing
as the distant ancestor of a vehicle

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:48.764
that may someday
explore oceans on other worlds.

01:27:48.848 --> 01:27:51.488
OK, Mike, looking good, You should
be able to take your core sample

01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:55.104
right at the base of
that chimney, Over,

01:27:57.649 --> 01:28:00.819
- Looks pretty hot though, Kevin,
- It's just like a burning tree stump,

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:03.488
That is just incredible,

01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:06.658
OK, it looks like most of the fluid
is coming out here and here,

01:28:06.742 --> 01:28:07.993
Can we go in right there?

01:28:08.035 --> 01:28:11.080
I will do the best I can,
but I'm working really hard,

01:28:11.163 --> 01:28:14.625
We're in some kind of
convective flow here,

01:28:20.923 --> 01:28:23.718
We're in there now,
You wanted close, we're close,

01:28:23.802 --> 01:28:26.054
Be careful,

01:28:26.137 --> 01:28:29.099
Looks like he's hit a
blowtorch, doesn't it?

01:28:29.182 --> 01:28:31.184
Think he's getting hit,

01:28:31.685 --> 01:28:36.148
Mike, back up, back up, You got the top of
the 'bot is right in the vent fluid, Over,

01:28:36.232 --> 01:28:38.943
Can you see if I'm in the hot water?

01:28:39.402 --> 01:28:41.904
You really want to know?

01:28:41.988 --> 01:28:46.200
Nice, Mike,
Just be the 'bot, Mike, Be the 'bot,

01:28:46.242 --> 01:28:48.870
Stay calm, you got it,

01:28:48.953 --> 01:28:52.415
Yeah, I'm gonna
just do this as quick as I can,

01:28:54.835 --> 01:28:58.630
- Oh, yes!
- I think we got it, I think we got it,

01:28:58.714 --> 01:29:03.260
Hey, we gotta just go cap this sample,
We just poked it right into the chimney,

01:29:03.344 --> 01:29:06.639
Yeah, copy that, Congratulations,
Go back and cap it,

01:29:06.722 --> 01:29:09.058
Roger that,

01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:11.644
Coming home,

01:29:12.896 --> 01:29:14.105
- Yeah,
- Look at...

01:29:14.189 --> 01:29:16.399
Jake took some hits,

01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:20.696
Other than the damage here
and here, it looks in pretty good shape,

01:29:20.779 --> 01:29:24.366
Yeah, that was pretty fun,
Pretty intense,

01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:30.748
Diving with Mike was great fun.
He is a mastermind with the robot.

01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:33.710
I didn't realize how much
went into making that 'bot work right.

01:29:33.793 --> 01:29:36.796
All right, it needs to come up,
A little more, Pete,

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.842
The 'bot had to be small
so that it could fit on the MIR.

01:29:40.926 --> 01:29:43.929
It had to have
its own onboard power supply.

01:29:44.012 --> 01:29:46.932
Back to neutral and we're ready to go,

01:29:46.974 --> 01:29:50.436
Inside the sub,
I have a laptop and a joystick,

01:29:50.478 --> 01:29:53.481
and that's all I have inside the sub.

01:29:57.568 --> 01:29:59.445
The fiber is unique.

01:29:59.487 --> 01:30:04.159
It allows us to send a light pulse
back and forth to the vehicle.

01:30:04.242 --> 01:30:06.954
That's how we talk to the vehicle.

01:30:09.581 --> 01:30:13.127
And we can control
the little camera as well.

01:30:15.463 --> 01:30:18.549
The 'bot creates
a telepresence for us.

01:30:18.633 --> 01:30:23.763
It actually allows us to feel
like we're outside of the submarine.

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:27.309
- All right, I'm gonna get a little
bit closer, - Oh, he's beautiful,

01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:29.853
I never saw anything
like this, Look at that,

01:30:29.895 --> 01:30:32.648
Uh-oh, he sees us now,
Hey, hey, hey!

01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:34.233
He's going after you!

01:30:34.316 --> 01:30:36.610
Look, look, look,
he's grabbed the gripper,

01:30:36.694 --> 01:30:40.031
He's putting his tentacles on the gripper,
This is cool,

01:30:40.114 --> 01:30:44.535
Who's grabbing who?
That was incredible,

01:30:44.619 --> 01:30:48.331
It deliberately reached straight out
and probed the gripper,

01:30:48.373 --> 01:30:50.917
I've never had
an encounter like that with the ROV,

01:30:51.001 --> 01:30:54.838
with an animal that came right up
to us and touched the ROV like that,

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.758
It was an extraordinary encounter.

01:30:57.841 --> 01:31:01.178
It was as though
I got to shake hands with an alien.

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.139
As an underwater explorer,

01:31:03.222 --> 01:31:08.895
that was probably one of the highlights
of my whole experience underwater.

01:31:08.978 --> 01:31:12.357
It's not hard to imagine
that someday it would be possible

01:31:12.398 --> 01:31:15.193
to explore oceans on another world.

01:31:15.235 --> 01:31:17.779
So getting an idea
of what it's like to explore

01:31:17.863 --> 01:31:20.657
these extreme environments
on our own planet

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:24.620
could very well
pave the way to exploring Europa.

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.672
A mission to explore
under the ice of Europa

01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:38.051
would be the ultimate
robotic challenge.

01:31:49.063 --> 01:31:51.357
During the landing,
the team in mission control

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:54.151
would pretty much
be along for the ride.

01:32:02.786 --> 01:32:06.081
Europa is so far away,
that even at the speed of light

01:32:06.123 --> 01:32:10.294
it would take more than an hour
for a command just to reach the vehicle.

01:32:10.377 --> 01:32:13.255
It's really on its own.

01:32:13.297 --> 01:32:16.425
It has to be smart enough
to avoid terrain hazards,

01:32:16.467 --> 01:32:19.762
and to find
a good landing site on the ice.

01:32:39.492 --> 01:32:42.036
Now we have to get through the ice.

01:32:43.037 --> 01:32:48.710
You need a melt probe.
It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.

01:33:00.431 --> 01:33:04.894
The ice could be anywhere
from three to sixteen miles deep.

01:33:05.895 --> 01:33:11.901
Week after week, the melt probe will sink
of its own weight through the ancient ice.

01:33:12.902 --> 01:33:15.071
Until finally...

01:33:28.419 --> 01:33:33.716
Now, what are you gonna do when
you reach the surface of that ocean?

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:43.310
You need an AUV,
an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle.

01:33:44.353 --> 01:33:46.313
It needs to be one smart puppy,

01:33:46.396 --> 01:33:51.485
able to navigate and make decisions
on its own in an alien ocean.

01:34:14.093 --> 01:34:19.557
Europa has internal heat.
It may well have hydrothermal venting.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:22.685
If it does,
and if the chemistry is right...

01:34:38.953 --> 01:34:41.122
It will have an enormous impact on humanity

01:34:41.205 --> 01:34:44.667
if we find life
in an ocean on another world.

01:34:48.296 --> 01:34:51.299
But in order to find it,
we have to go there.

01:34:55.345 --> 01:34:59.308
And to go there,
we have to continue the journey here.

01:35:00.726 --> 01:35:06.649
Exploration is like a muscle. You have
to exercise it to make it stronger.

01:35:06.691 --> 01:35:09.444
And if water is
the common ingredient for life,

01:35:09.485 --> 01:35:12.322
we need to take what we know
about deep ocean exploration

01:35:12.405 --> 01:35:17.327
and apply it to space, giving scientists
and explorers the experience they'll need

01:35:17.410 --> 01:35:20.789
to follow the water,
wherever it might be.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.962
Discovering life at the vents
shows us that nature has more to teach us

01:35:27.004 --> 01:35:29.340
than we can possibly imagine.

01:35:30.341 --> 01:35:33.219
But I wonder,
what would it be like

01:35:33.302 --> 01:35:37.140
if we were exploring
the ocean on another world?

01:35:40.769 --> 01:35:43.146
- All stop,
- Stopping,

01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:45.816
Hold it steady here,

01:35:45.858 --> 01:35:50.779
It might completely
change our definition of life.

01:35:50.863 --> 01:35:52.823
Let's see what they do,

01:36:14.179 --> 01:36:16.140
Right on,

01:36:17.516 --> 01:36:22.438
Houston, "Endurance." We have arrived
on station at the coordinates,

01:36:22.522 --> 01:36:24.816
and we have some new friends.

01:36:47.257 --> 01:36:50.135
Who knows what's out there?

01:36:50.218 --> 01:36:52.178
So we have to go.
