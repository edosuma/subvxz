Bob Marley's "Redemption Song"
is actually in conversation

01:05.848 --> 01:07.980
with the ideals
of Marcus Garvey.

01:08.024 --> 01:12.463
So in this case, Marley's words
are a direct reference to --

01:12.507 --> 01:14.117
It's a riff on Garvey's

01:14.161 --> 01:15.988

01:46.976 --> 01:49.587
and not so much
on the mental enslavement,

freedom for the diaspora?

01:54.331 --> 01:57.465
Well, Garvey...

01:57.508 --> 02:01.033

been thus far?

-I understand.
