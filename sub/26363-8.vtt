Times change.
And these days, women are the

15:30.214 --> 15:33.773

This week Robert Mueller
released the teaser trailer

29:06.344 --> 29:11.113
"Trump: End game."
Federal prosecutors said Friday

29:11.114 --> 29:14.513
that Michael Cohen committed two
election-related crimes at the

29:14.514 --> 29:17.473
direction of a person identified
as "individual-1."

29:17.474 --> 29:20.643
Now, we don't know for sure who
individual-1 is.

29:20.644 --> 29:23.313
But let's just say things are
pretty tense right now over at

29:23.314 --> 29:28.043
individual-1 tower.
Earlier today, Trump called

29:28.044 --> 29:30.713
the Mueller report "collusion
illusion," which is also my

29:30.714 --> 29:36.573
favorite guns 'n' roses album.
And yesterday Trump tweeted --

29:36.574 --> 29:39.243
with zero context or
explanation -- "totally clears

29:39.244 --> 29:42.013
the president, thank you."
Sounds like someone's been

29:42.014 --> 29:46.643
reading "the secret."
Now, I don't blame Trump for

29:46.644 --> 29:49.813
thinking that his tweets are
powerful enough to make things

29:49.814 --> 29:52.643
go away.
I mean, just this week his

29:52.644 --> 29:57.673
tweets about China were able to
tank the entire stock market.

29:57.674 --> 30:02.043
I mean if something you does get
everybody indicted, you would

30:02.044 --> 30:07.473
think you have something to do
with it.

30:07.474 --> 30:08.713
Might not even be reliable
witnesses against him.

30:08.714 --> 30:11.213
Trump's already called Cohen a
weak man.

30:11.214 --> 30:12.673
Pretty soon he's gonna be like,
"can you really trust a guy with

30:12.674 --> 30:16.073
a name like Donald Trump Jr.?"
Trump is now calling for an

30:16.074 --> 30:17.443
end to the Mueller probe.
Which I mean, you got to admit,

30:17.444 --> 30:18.643
is worth a shot.
I mean, you don't want to go all

30:18.644 --> 30:22.743
the way to prison and then find
out you could have just called

30:22.744 --> 30:24.013
it off the whole time.
You know what's the fun thing

30:24.014 --> 30:25.413
about watching Trump be
president?

30:25.414 --> 30:26.613
It's that he tries the things
that would I try.

30:26.614 --> 30:32.273
I bet he still slaps the side of
his TV when it acts up.

30:32.274 --> 30:36.073
You better hurry up.
You only get one day on that

30:36.074 --> 30:38.113

And nothing makes you seem

30:38.114 --> 30:42.313
guilty than filing a counter
report before the report is out.

30:42.314 --> 30:47.313
It's like watching "cops" and as
soon as they pull off to the

30:47.314 --> 30:56.873
house saying, first of all,
she's lying.

Well, one of the best global

Columbus, Ohio.

32:53.344 --> 32:58.213

got aunts.

have ponytails too?

is, Michael, Michael --

33:04.574 --> 33:06.343
what?
My cousin's neighbors are

33:06.344 --> 33:12.013

Okay, Carrie, that sounds

33:12.014 --> 33:15.743
pretty specific to your family
trips.

33:15.744 --> 33:20.373
Like where can other people
travel?

33:20.374 --> 33:25.613
Try the twin freaking cities!
Yeah, where you'll go to a farm

33:25.614 --> 33:29.673
and see a really big pig and
your brother will tell you

33:29.674 --> 33:31.773
that's where ham comes from.
And then you'll sob because you

33:31.774 --> 33:36.413

33:36.414 --> 33:37.913

Might I recommend staying at my

Because Michael, Michael --

33:54.844 --> 34:01.643

She's braless on the couch!

34:10.014 --> 34:13.342
about, you know,
testing boundaries.

34:13.344 --> 34:15.543

parents were drinking daiquiris

34:15.543 --> 34:17.973

don't get it.
