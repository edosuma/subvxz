03:37.200 --> 03:39.440
- What the hell's that all about?
- Nothing.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.040
Hey, Mike, you in a hurry?

04:13.320 --> 04:15.080
What's with them?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.600
Maybe they're just tired.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.760
Sorry, boys, the kitchen's closed.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.720
We're sticking to the story.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.200
No matter how rough it gets,
understand?

04:57.320 --> 04:59.360
Whatever.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.160
Greg?

05:13.480 --> 05:18.880
Go ahead, Mike, make that phone call.
We're all with you. Go on.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.240
That's right, man.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.640
That's right, go.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.600
Working your boys kind of late tonight,
were you, Mike?

06:15.960 --> 06:18.080
<i>This is Sergeant Reynolds</i>
<i>from Criminal Investigations</i>

06:18.240 --> 06:21.160
<i>calling Lieutenant Frank Watters.</i>
<i>Are you there, lieutenant? Over.</i>

06:34.440 --> 06:37.480
- "Lieutenant, do you read me? Over."
- I'm here, sergeant.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.920
<i>I've checked with Sheriff Davis.</i>
<i>He says he'll give you all the details</i>

06:41.080 --> 06:43.000
<i>when you get to Snowflake. Over.</i>

06:44.160 --> 06:45.760
What's his problem?

06:46.440 --> 06:49.520
<i>Frank, it sounds like he's</i>
<i>in over his head on this one. Over.</i>

06:50.720 --> 06:52.320
I hear you.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.560
Police investigation. There's nothing
for you to see or to hear, so just...

07:00.720 --> 07:03.880
Everybody just go on home, now.
There's nothing to see.

07:04.040 --> 07:08.760
Get in your cars, take your kids,
take your families, go on home.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.800
Lieutenant Watters?

07:17.960 --> 07:19.880
- I'm Frank Watters.
- Sheriff Blake Davis.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.040
I know a lot about you, yes, sir,
from the papers.

07:23.240 --> 07:27.200
Sure do. About you not having any
unsolved cases here or in Montana.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.040
Nothing but a myth.
But a damn fine one.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.640
Now, why the radio silence
on bringing me here, sheriff?

07:32.840 --> 07:36.320
Well, we got a special kind
of situation here, Frank.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.240
A missing boy on our hands.
Travis Walton.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.760
About an hour ago, a deputy of mine
took a missing-persons report

07:42.920 --> 07:46.360
from a fella by the name of Rogers.
Mike Rogers.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.200
I've known him a long time.
He's a good guy, straight guy.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.240
He's been running a crew
up the Mogollon Rim

07:51.400 --> 07:53.360
near Turkey Spring
for about a month.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.520
Yep, they had a government contract
to clear out the brush.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.160
Dennis!

07:58.880 --> 08:00.560
I want you to meet my deputy.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.640
Dennis, shake hands
with Lieutenant Watters. Deputy Clay.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.600
- Hi, Dennis.
- It's an honor, lieutenant.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.200
I read about that wetback murder
you handled down Nogales way.

08:08.360 --> 08:12.880
Dennis, can you tell us who else
is in that gang besides Mike Rogers?

08:13.960 --> 08:17.520
Yeah. We got David Whitlock, 26.
Local boy, active in the church.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.400
<i>Greg Hayes, 17.</i>
<i>High school kid from Winslow.</i>

08:20.600 --> 08:24.560
<i>This one's pretty shook-up.</i>
<i>Robert Cogdill, 20, from Durango.</i>

08:24.760 --> 08:27.800
<i>Joined the crew just a week ago.</i>
<i>Allan Dallis, 25.</i>

08:27.960 --> 08:30.200
<i>A drifter,</i>
<i>on the crew just over two weeks.</i>

08:30.480 --> 08:33.559
- Bad apple, if you ask me.
- Yeah. He's got hell in his eye.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.440
Sure does.

08:36.120 --> 08:39.320
Frank, I think that...

08:40.400 --> 08:42.400
I think that maybe...

08:43.280 --> 08:45.760
Maybe you better hear this
from the horse's mouth.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.240
Lead me to the horse.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.720
- Dennis, get these folks out of here.
- Come on, folks.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.600
Give them some room.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.120
Restaurant's closed for the night.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.240
- Now, what in the hell is that thing for?
- It bother you?

09:03.960 --> 09:07.640
- Yeah, it bothers me.
- I don't want any misinterpretations.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.000
This way there's a clear record
of everything you tell us.

09:10.160 --> 09:14.280
Well, we already told that Barney Fife
of a deputy everything we know.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.280
I'll tell you, Frank,

09:17.000 --> 09:18.520
Clay wrote down everything.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.800
We'll use the recorder.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.920
A man with nothing to hide
is a man with nothing to worry about.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.040
- You're the leader, right?
- Yeah.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.720
Yeah, he's our fearless leader.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.840
Maybe I should be
talking to you instead.

09:37.960 --> 09:43.400
Oh, no. No, sir. He's the boss.
There's no doubt about that.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.880
Tell me about Travis Walton.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.440
- About what happened?
- About Travis.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.760
Start by telling me who he is.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.280
He's...

10:00.920 --> 10:03.120
He was my best friend.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.320
Wake up, Dad, wake up.
Wake up, Dad.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.800
It's the tickle monster!
It's the tickle monster.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.160
Ow, what are you doing?
Daddy just cracked his elbow.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.960
How are you? Good morning.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.280
- Good morning. What are you doing?
- Breakfast is ready!

10:36.440 --> 10:38.600
- Waking you up.
- Who told you to wake me up?

10:38.760 --> 10:40.000
- Mommy did!
- Mommy did!

10:40.200 --> 10:41.440
Why did she tell you to wake me up?

10:41.640 --> 10:43.920
Because she wants me
to tickle you again?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.440
Travis, you son of a bitch,
get off that bike!

11:10.080 --> 11:11.200
Cathy, what are you doing?

11:12.160 --> 11:13.280
Nothing, Mom.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.560
Hey, get that thing
off the sidewalk, Travis!

11:31.560 --> 11:34.760
Here you go. Coming in. There you go.
You want butter on that?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.360
- Can I have some French toast?
- Sure.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.120
I can have some?

11:43.240 --> 11:44.960
I got some for you right here.

11:45.160 --> 11:47.360
No, I gotta go.
I gotta get the truck running.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.000
Wait a sec. Let me talk to you
for a second, please.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.760
What...? The bank's gonna
call again today.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.240
- So?
- So, what should I tell them?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.040
Do we have to talk about that
right now?

11:59.240 --> 12:02.640
No, you know what? We can wait
till they throw us out of our house.

12:26.520 --> 12:27.600
Hey, Mike!

12:36.920 --> 12:37.920
Morning.

12:40.600 --> 12:41.840
What's the matter?

12:43.600 --> 12:45.000
You and Katie again?

12:46.160 --> 12:48.760
Hey, Mike, want a doughnut?

12:50.120 --> 12:51.680
Make you feel better.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.680
About time we got yours
back on the road, don't you think?

13:09.440 --> 13:12.400
Unless you got some secret plan
to let it rust and sell it for scrap.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.280
We'll start tonight.
What do you think?

13:21.480 --> 13:23.200
I gotta show you something.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.560
- What's this?
- This is our future.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.400
MT Motors.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.360
Serving all of Navajo County.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.720
Harleys, Nortons, Yamahas,
you name it.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.560
We'll do commercials like the guys
in Phoenix.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.600
"MT Motors. Our prices are so great,
our show room

13:39.800 --> 13:41.400
is almost always empty."

13:42.480 --> 13:46.920
Get it? Empty. M-T. Motors.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.240
Empty. What do you think?

13:53.480 --> 13:56.360
I think we better just concentrate
on finishing the contract.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.120
The Forest Service
won't extend the deadline.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.720
Mike, don't worry. This is the deal.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.000
Look, Travis, my mortgage
is on the line.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.400
I gotta worry. I got no choice, man.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.520
We'll get it done or we won't.

14:17.640 --> 14:18.600
Hey, where you going?

14:21.560 --> 14:22.960
Love awaits me.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.880
Look, it's Uncle Travis.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.360
- Hi, Uncle Travis.
- God. Travis, can't you use the door?

14:30.080 --> 14:31.720
- No.
- Go...

14:51.320 --> 14:53.160
- Morning.
- Good morning.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.800
Breakfast in bed.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.520
Thank you.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.800
Dana, let's get married.
I can't wait anymore.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.000
- Travis.
- Don't answer. Don't answer. Just...

15:16.200 --> 15:18.000
Just think about it.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.120
Okay.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.720
Can we get going, please?
Before I get seriously sick.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.040
- See you later.
- Okay.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.160
How you doing, fellas?

16:08.480 --> 16:09.960
- Good morning.
- Hi, guys.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.280
Bobby, every day I tell you
turn it down or turn it off.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.520
I'm not gonna tell you again.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.520
You need to listen
to some blues, man.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.320
You guys got any doughnuts
up there?

16:27.480 --> 16:29.760
Well, we did, Dallis,
but we ate them all.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.320
Hey, listen to this, man:

16:31.480 --> 16:34.040
"Lady in Borneo gives birth
to a litter of 13."

16:34.480 --> 16:36.360
- Litter?
- Yeah.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.080
- Bunch of bullshit.
- What do you mean, man?

16:38.280 --> 16:40.000
It's right here. Read it.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.120
Get out of my way.

16:42.280 --> 16:46.000
- Hey, leave him alone.
- Shut up, mind your own business.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.640
What if I make it my business?

16:50.840 --> 16:53.160
Is that what you want, dude?
You wanna make it your business?

16:53.320 --> 16:55.240
Can we have one day
without you two girls fighting,

16:55.400 --> 16:56.960
- please?
- Why don't you shut up, David.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.720
- Hey! Knock it off, man.
- You knock it off.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.480
- No, you knock it off, Dallis, now.
- No, you knock it off.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.720
Come on, man. This is a good song.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.480
Turn it down, Bobby. I mean it.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.160
All right, boys. Let's get moving.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.840
All right, listen up.
It's gonna be a long day.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.360
David and Dallis, you guys alternate
on the big saw to buck the windfall.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.280
- Bobby and Greg are on cleanup.
- Right.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.040
Let's try to get the east side
of Pine Mountain before sundown.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.400
All right? Get the water. Let's go.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.400
Another day, another dollar.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.240
Down the hill!

18:43.120 --> 18:45.080
Wide load now.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.120
Timber.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.400
All right, lunch!

19:11.960 --> 19:13.640
Not too bright!

19:15.720 --> 19:17.640
Can't hear you.

19:21.640 --> 19:24.240
Hey, knock it off, Dallis!
I said, lunch!

19:27.760 --> 19:29.320
Dallis!

20:11.880 --> 20:13.720
- Hey.
- Hey, bud.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.440
What do you say we do a little fishing
when the contract's over?

20:17.520 --> 20:18.920
When this contract's over, huh?

20:19.080 --> 20:21.360
Come on, it's what we need.
One of our camping trips.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.480
Some hunting, some fishing,
chasing bears.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.640
Oh, yeah, I remember.
You ran that bear up that tree.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.800
I was just trying to make friends.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.720
So how come you can't
make friends with Dallis?

20:34.920 --> 20:37.280
He's just jealous
I can do something he can't.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.200
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Read and write.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.320
So, what do you say, man?
A little R and R, and then MT Motors.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.240
You think I'm gonna let
a flake like you marry my little sister?

20:49.320 --> 20:51.640
A flake from Snowflake. How poetic.
I like that.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.800
Yeah, that's just my point.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.520
What's your point?

20:55.720 --> 20:59.360
You're a dreamer.
And you're not ready for marriage.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.920
Not if I gotta turn into you...

21:03.080 --> 21:04.800
...Mike.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.440
We went back to work,

21:13.240 --> 21:15.520
and we finished up
along about dusk.

21:15.720 --> 21:19.960
The day's work was done,
and the five of you left the work site.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.880
Six. There was six of us.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.480
- Travis Walton left with you?
- Of course.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.400
The rest of you boys
go along with that?

21:29.560 --> 21:31.280
Yes.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.160
How about you, Mr. Dallis?

21:37.560 --> 21:39.360
You go along with that?

21:39.960 --> 21:42.400
Oh, yeah, I go along with that.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.600
You don't sound too sure.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.600
Well, I'm sure.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.880
- What's it to you?
- Oh, it just seems like that you had

21:53.040 --> 21:54.920
the biggest ax to grind with Travis.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.280
What was that whole thing
with that chain saw?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.480
I was just having some fun.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.680
That's all.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.440
You gonna arrest me for that?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.560
What happened to your hand?

22:17.600 --> 22:19.960
I did it to myself earlier today.

22:20.560 --> 22:21.720
Just having a little fun?

22:21.880 --> 22:24.440
Yeah, that's right,
I was just having a little fun.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.960
You ought to be more careful, son.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.520
Yeah, well, I'll do my best, Daddy.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.720
I'll bet you will.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.680
Why don't you fellas
tell Lieutenant Watters what you saw.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.080
Or what you think you saw.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.120
It was Dallis that saw it first.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.880
What about it?

22:46.080 --> 22:49.400
Tell us about it. What did you see?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.400
What did it look like?

22:56.280 --> 22:58.480
It looked like...

23:00.640 --> 23:02.400
Like a fire.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.480
- You awake?
- I'm awake.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.320
What in the hell is that?

23:30.080 --> 23:31.840
That is strange.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.240
What is?
What are you guys looking at?

23:38.280 --> 23:40.640
Looks like the sunset to me.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.520
No, Greg, that's east. The sun set
behind us 20 minutes ago.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.520
Well, what do you think it is, then?

23:48.480 --> 23:52.680
Maybe a fire or maybe
a plane crash in the woods.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.880
Yeah. Yeah, a plane crash.
It could be.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.080
Christ, man.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.240
Hey, what the hell is that?

24:09.400 --> 24:11.360
Maybe we should just
turn back, huh?

24:11.720 --> 24:14.720
That's gotta be a fire.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.640
Look, it's moving.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.400
I saw it.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.200
- It isn't moving, Bobby. It isn't...
- Look, man.

24:25.400 --> 24:26.960
Is it?

24:28.040 --> 24:30.120
That's one monster forest fire there.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.760
Fire, my ass.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.840
That ain't no fire, man.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.920
What else could it be?

24:39.960 --> 24:42.400
The heck is going on here, Mike?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.320
- You screwing around?
- No.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.520
Mike, maybe we ought to do
like Greg says

24:51.720 --> 24:53.120
and just pull over for a minute.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.240
No, Mike. I wanna see what it is.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.080
There's only one road out of here,
and we're on it.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.320
If that's a fire
and we can't get around it,

25:03.480 --> 25:05.160
we're gonna be
spending the night out here.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.680
Mike?

25:17.480 --> 25:18.840
Stop, Mike! Stop the truck!

25:21.680 --> 25:25.680
- That's wild.
- Holy Christ.

25:26.920 --> 25:29.080
- Travis!
- Travis!

25:29.240 --> 25:31.000
- You son of a bitch!
- The hell you doing?

25:31.160 --> 25:33.120
Get back in the truck, asshole!

25:33.280 --> 25:34.960
What is that?

25:35.080 --> 25:38.080
- What is that thing?
- Oh, my God!

25:40.240 --> 25:41.920
Travis!

25:44.680 --> 25:45.960
The hell's he doing out there?

25:46.120 --> 25:49.280
- Get back to the truck!
- The hell is that?

25:51.560 --> 25:53.960
- Travis!
- Get back in the truck!

26:00.520 --> 26:03.120
- Get out of there.
- What is that?

26:03.280 --> 26:04.840
I don't know what that is.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.200
Hey, Mike!

26:17.360 --> 26:18.760
Travis, get out of there!

26:18.920 --> 26:21.440
Leave the son of a bitch here
if he's gonna be an asshole!

26:25.160 --> 26:28.240
Travis, get back here! Travis!

26:38.640 --> 26:40.800
Run, Travis, run!

26:43.720 --> 26:45.280
- What the hell is that?
- Do you feel that?

26:45.480 --> 26:46.680
- Crazy...
- Travis!

26:56.080 --> 26:57.640
- Travis!
- Get the hell out of here!

26:57.840 --> 27:00.240
- Get back in here! Travis!
- What the hell is that?

27:15.880 --> 27:17.720
Travis!

27:20.680 --> 27:22.120
He's...

27:22.280 --> 27:24.400
- He's...
- Go! Go!

27:24.560 --> 27:26.560
Go! Go!

27:28.360 --> 27:31.160
Mike, he's dead! He's dead!

27:32.840 --> 27:34.720
- Oh, Mike, he's gone!
- Go!

27:34.920 --> 27:36.160
- I'm not leaving him.
- He's dead!

27:36.360 --> 27:37.320
I'm not leaving him here!

27:37.520 --> 27:40.160
- Go! Get out of here! Go!
- Get the hell out of here, Mike!

27:40.360 --> 27:41.360
He's dead.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.920
What the hell you doing?
He's dead!

27:43.080 --> 27:45.760
- He's dead. He's dead.
- Come on!

27:46.040 --> 27:47.880
- Get the hell out of here!
- Let's go!

27:48.040 --> 27:50.160
Go! Go!

27:52.520 --> 27:54.960
- He's dead?
- Oh, my God!

27:55.120 --> 27:57.680
It's moving! It's coming after us, man!
It's gonna kill us.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.680
Stay down! Stay down!
Everybody stay down!

28:03.640 --> 28:05.520
Slow down, Mike!

28:09.440 --> 28:10.760
- What is that thing?
- I don't know.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.040
- What the heck was that thing?!
- I don't know!

28:13.200 --> 28:15.240
I don't know, Mike!
I don't know what it is.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.520
- What was it?
- Oh, my God!

28:17.720 --> 28:19.000
What was that?

28:22.120 --> 28:23.840
Slow down, Mike!

28:26.760 --> 28:28.320
Shit!

28:31.000 --> 28:32.360
Come on, man, you're gonna kill us.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.440
- Is it following us?
- I don't know.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.720
I can't see it. Is it following us?

28:36.920 --> 28:38.240
- I don't know!
- Shut up!

28:38.840 --> 28:40.200
- Come on!
- Look out!

28:47.600 --> 28:49.960
- Come on, man!
- Get off of me!

28:56.960 --> 28:59.040
What in the hell you stopping for?

28:59.240 --> 29:01.120
We left him there.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.360
- He's dead, jackass!
- We gotta go back.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.200
- No!
- No way. What are you talking about?

29:06.360 --> 29:09.840
No, maybe we do gotta go back.
Maybe we gotta go back!

29:10.040 --> 29:11.920
- No way! No!
- No way, man! No!

29:12.080 --> 29:13.840
We don't know that he's dead yet.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.720
- Get out of here! Let's get...!
- What are you talking about?

29:16.880 --> 29:19.120
I'm going back! I'm going back!

29:19.560 --> 29:21.440
If you don't wanna go,
get out of the car now.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.000
I'll come pick you up later.

29:23.960 --> 29:27.560
- You can't do this to us, man.
- What if you don't come back, Mike?

29:32.400 --> 29:33.840
Get out.

29:41.400 --> 29:45.120
Go, man. You gotta go. Get out.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.320
It'll be all right. You stay by the road.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.240
Son of a bitch.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.680
I...

30:21.440 --> 30:24.000
I searched the woods and...

30:24.160 --> 30:25.800
But he wasn't...

30:27.720 --> 30:29.640
There was nothing...

30:34.440 --> 30:36.520
They took him.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.240
You expect me to believe

30:49.000 --> 30:53.440
that a flying saucer came down
and took your friend away

30:53.640 --> 30:55.600
to outer space?

30:55.760 --> 30:58.440
That's the truth, mister.
That's exactly what happened.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.840
Is it?

31:00.040 --> 31:02.320
Is it? According to your story,
you never even went back

31:02.440 --> 31:05.080
to the clearing,
so you don't know, do you?

31:05.600 --> 31:06.960
I didn't have to go back.

31:07.120 --> 31:11.000
Mike Rogers says he wasn't there,
you can take it to the bank.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.000
And you know that, Blake.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.840
Why the heck aren't you
speaking up for us?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.920
Why you letting this man
talk to us like this?

31:17.120 --> 31:19.000
- David, I...
- It seems like you're not even trying

31:19.160 --> 31:21.000
to believe us.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.200
We all saw the thing.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.960
We all saw the guy get zapped.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.840
You saw something.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.080
At least, you thought you did.

31:34.120 --> 31:37.280
- And what about you, son?
- Me?

31:37.440 --> 31:38.800
Yeah. What did you see?

31:44.800 --> 31:47.560
I saw the same...

31:48.400 --> 31:50.280
Same as they saw.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.800
Well, that's quite a story.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.960
Yeah, well,

32:01.120 --> 32:04.440
I think it's about time to get out of here.
What do you boys think?

32:04.640 --> 32:07.360
You're real broken up about
your missing buddy, aren't you?

32:08.240 --> 32:10.280
Oh, that's very perceptive.

32:10.440 --> 32:13.200
- That's because he's not my friend.
- I got that.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.240
- Clearly.
- Did you?

32:16.040 --> 32:18.720
Good. Now, are you done?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.240
We'll tell you when.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.280
I don't want anybody to leave
till I get

32:23.440 --> 32:25.720
everybody's phone number
and address.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.520
- Shouldn't we try to find him?
- This is a...

32:27.720 --> 32:30.400
He's not on the mountain,
remember?

32:30.560 --> 32:32.240
They took him.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.960
Well, what do you think?
Think we ought to head up there?

32:37.160 --> 32:40.400
Too late. Not enough men.
We'll head out in the morning.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.960
Well, Dallis, you sure can talk.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.880
See, I told you he wasn't
gonna believe your damn story.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.120
Not a goddamn word of it.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.760
Looks like they were
working on it there.

33:07.960 --> 33:11.800
Boy, that truck looks like
it's been to hell and back.

33:11.960 --> 33:14.240
Well, the sun comes up
at 6 in the morning.

33:14.440 --> 33:17.920
We got 50 men, jeeps, horses, dogs.

33:18.080 --> 33:21.160
I wanna call Flagstaff
and get two helicopters.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.840
- That be enough?
- That's plenty.

33:24.040 --> 33:27.360
My hunch is, tomorrow
we'll find Travis Walton.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.960
Of course, I'd be surprised
if we found him in one piece.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.560
Yeah.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.440
You recommend a good motel,
sheriff?

33:34.600 --> 33:36.240
Yeah. Chapparal.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.800
Just after you get inside
to Snowflake,

33:38.920 --> 33:40.920
right there by the water tower.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.200
Still, you have to wonder
how those boys

33:43.360 --> 33:45.080
came up with such a crazy story.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.640
Yeah.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.240
Back on Earth,
we're dealing with a murder.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.520
Plain and simple.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.120
Good night, sheriff.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.320
Good night, Frank.

34:52.520 --> 34:55.760
<i>An Agriculture Department</i>
<i>spokesman acknowledged that...</i>

34:55.960 --> 35:00.000
It's all over the radio. They're making
it out to be a big joke or something.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.360
It's no joke.

35:02.640 --> 35:03.800
You left him there?

35:04.200 --> 35:06.000
I don't know where he is, Dana.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.760
What do you mean,
you don't know where he is?

35:09.960 --> 35:11.800
Just what I said.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.000
Well, how could you just
leave him out there?

35:20.200 --> 35:23.120
The radio was saying something
about outer space.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.040
I didn't just leave him.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.240
And, yeah, there was
something out there, Kate. I...

35:28.440 --> 35:30.840
I... I don't understand. "Out there"?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.000
Is Travis gone?

35:36.200 --> 35:39.200
They're gonna send out
a search party for him tomorrow.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.160
Where is he, Mike?

35:43.880 --> 35:48.440
Where is he, Mike?
Where is he, Mike? Mike...

35:49.480 --> 35:53.040
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.240
It'll be all right.

36:00.280 --> 36:04.440
My Father in heaven,
I humbly bow before you.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.400
I ask for your spirit to be with me.

36:09.640 --> 36:12.600
Forgive us, Father,
for what we've done.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.880
I want two-man teams on that ridge.

36:45.040 --> 36:48.600
If that boy's out here,
I wanna find him.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.720
- You got it?
- I got it.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.640
Let's get going, boys.
And God bless you.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.280
You're certain. This is the spot.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.120
I mean, it was night, but...
But, yeah.

37:01.280 --> 37:03.240
Here. It was right here.
This is exactly where he fell.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.960
You said there was
an obvious depression.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.480
That we could see it clearly.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.880
This is it, right here.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.760
Now, where the hell was it?
Was it over there, was it over here?

37:12.920 --> 37:15.320
What are we doing, playing games?

37:16.160 --> 37:17.920
I'm not sure.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.840
I see.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.200
He doesn't believe us.

37:25.360 --> 37:26.840
Where's my brother, Mike?

37:27.040 --> 37:29.400
- What'd you guys do with him?
- Look, Dan, take it easy.

37:29.600 --> 37:33.160
- Back off, Whitlock.
- Hey, we're gonna find him, Dan.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.280
Which one of you is Allan Dallis?

37:36.480 --> 37:37.880
He's not here.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.280
- What about him?
- I did some checking.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.120
Your hired hand's got himself
a nice little criminal record.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.360
Assault with a deadly weapon.

37:46.520 --> 37:51.160
Listen, Mike, if anything
happened to my baby bro,

37:51.280 --> 37:54.480
I'm holding you personally responsible.
You got that?

37:56.840 --> 37:58.440
Yeah.

38:11.760 --> 38:14.640
Give me a break. I came up here
to earn some money, man.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.120
Now I might go to prison.

38:17.480 --> 38:20.040
Well, maybe it's God's way
of punishing us, Bobby.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.440
Spare me the God talk,
okay, David?

38:21.640 --> 38:22.960
Hey, even if you don't
believe in him,

38:23.080 --> 38:24.840
you know the difference
between right and wrong.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.440
We all do. We got no excuses.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.040
What?

38:32.480 --> 38:34.240
What is that?

38:45.040 --> 38:47.760
Apache reservation starts
right up there. Right there.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.320
Hey, we got something over here!

39:00.760 --> 39:04.560
- Find anything yet?
- I don't know.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.320
Wonder what they'll find in there.

39:12.520 --> 39:14.160
You got any ideas, Mike?

39:14.960 --> 39:17.120
There's something here, sheriff.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.760
- Is it Walton?
- It's him.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.520
- I knew it.
- They killed him.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.280
What is it?

39:42.600 --> 39:44.160
Quit digging.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.040
It ain't human, Frank.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.160
Some hunter buried his dog.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.160
I thought that was him.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.880
Dana's staying over
at the Waltons' house.

40:18.320 --> 40:21.720
Some guy from the A.L.I.
Called today.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.600
They've taken you off the contract
and hired a whole new crew.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.840
You don't seem too surprised.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.280
I'm not.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.400
Well, why aren't you?

40:36.520 --> 40:39.440
What are we gonna do
for a paycheck next week?

40:39.880 --> 40:41.920
Look, I'll figure it out, all right?

40:42.080 --> 40:45.120
You know, I don't get this.
My best friend has disappeared.

40:45.320 --> 40:48.360
God knows where he is,
and all you can think about is money.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.880
I'll tell you something else.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.960
People in this town are saying
terrible things about you.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.480
- Well, I don't care what they think.
- Well, I do.

40:56.680 --> 41:00.840
We live here, our kids live here.
Of course I care, and so should you.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.520
- Mommy.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.080
You know what? Listen,
why don't you go back to bed,

41:06.200 --> 41:08.080
and I promise you
I'll read you that story.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.800
I promise, okay? Okay.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.280
Don't let those bedbugs bite.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.640
What's she gonna say, huh?

41:17.800 --> 41:20.880
When everybody says
her father's a liar or...

41:23.880 --> 41:25.080
Go on, say it.

41:26.760 --> 41:29.400
A liar or a murderer.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.720
Including you?
Are you saying that, Kate?

41:37.640 --> 41:39.040
No.

41:39.760 --> 41:43.000
No. Of course not.

41:43.160 --> 41:45.080
I just... Michael, I just want you
to tell me

41:45.280 --> 41:48.400
what really happened up there.

41:50.840 --> 41:52.640
I told you what happened.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.040
I told you all I know.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.880
You believe me, don't you, Kate?

42:00.160 --> 42:02.200
You do believe me?

42:43.600 --> 42:47.440
<i>Hello. Yes, this is 51098,</i>
<i>what is it?</i>

42:47.600 --> 42:48.800
<i>This is Western Union.</i>

42:51.280 --> 42:53.640
You know, Mike, the word's out.

42:54.800 --> 42:56.160
Well, what word
would that be, Tom?

42:56.360 --> 42:58.360
Oh, I don't know, it's just that

42:58.560 --> 43:01.360
I been getting calls all day
from here to Timbuktu.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.160
As of tomorrow, I'm all booked up.

43:03.960 --> 43:07.040
- Well, who's calling?
- Reporters, sightseers,

43:07.200 --> 43:09.520
UFO buffs and the like.

43:09.760 --> 43:12.560
Hey, Mike,
what's really going on here?

43:15.400 --> 43:18.240
- Can you keep a secret, Tom?
- You bet.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.760
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

43:27.240 --> 43:30.520
Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers.

43:31.520 --> 43:32.920
You know, I feel like asking you

43:33.160 --> 43:35.320
if it's a beautiful day
in your neighborhood.

43:37.320 --> 43:40.360
Ray Melendez,
Action News, Phoenix.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.320
- Look, I just woke up.
- Oh, that's no problem.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.880
I just need to ask you a few questions.
What do you say, huh?

43:46.080 --> 43:47.440
I've got nothing to say.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.840
Well, see, I figured that you'd wanna,
like, you know,

43:51.000 --> 43:52.720
set the record straight.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.680
What with, you know,
everything that's being said

43:54.840 --> 43:56.040
about you and all, you know...

43:56.200 --> 43:57.560
Well, you figured wrong.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.000
It's for your own...
It's for your own good, you know.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.320
Just talk to the people.
Let them know what really happened.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.320
What do you say? Come on.

44:18.600 --> 44:21.000
- Hey, you guys, I think it's him.
- Is that him?

44:21.160 --> 44:22.080
I think so.

44:22.280 --> 44:25.080
Mike Rogers. Excuse me.
Mr. Rogers.

44:25.240 --> 44:27.840
Mr. Whitlock. I'm Jarvis Powell,
from A.F.A.R.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.200
We have had a lot of experience
in these matters,

44:30.360 --> 44:33.720
and I think we might be able
to help each other out.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.520
Well, we just wanted
to let you know that

44:39.720 --> 44:42.080
there are those of us out there
who know the truth.

44:43.960 --> 44:46.440
Now he's talking to this other guy.

44:48.600 --> 44:49.880
Go on.

44:52.920 --> 44:54.920
Please, give us a call
if we can be of service.

44:55.560 --> 44:56.640
Let's go.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.600
Anytime.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.320
- How much do I owe you, Earl?
- Two dollars.

45:14.800 --> 45:17.320
<i>Seventy-one, 65...</i>

45:27.680 --> 45:28.720
Betty.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.880
Yeah, I know. These boys know more
than they're telling.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.760
What the heck's that lowlife
Buck Morton staring at?

45:42.960 --> 45:44.840
He keeps looking over here.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.600
Mike, this town's gone nuts.
Everything's crazy.

45:47.960 --> 45:49.720
Yeah, I can see that,
now that we're TV news.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.160
They're going up
to look for Travis again.

45:52.280 --> 45:53.560
They won't find anything.

45:53.720 --> 45:57.920
Watters come by at 6 in the morning,
he starts asking us all these questions.

45:58.160 --> 45:59.240
He's all over us, man.

45:59.400 --> 46:02.080
- Yeah, he said if we cooperated...
- Come on.

46:02.240 --> 46:04.000
- If we confess.
- Confess?

46:04.160 --> 46:07.480
Yeah. Yeah, if we confess,
he's gonna try to help us out.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.560
Help us.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.360
What the hell's going on
around here?

46:11.560 --> 46:14.160
You got something
you wanna say to me?

46:15.280 --> 46:16.480
Go sit down, Buck.

46:16.680 --> 46:17.720
Hot food, coming through.

46:17.880 --> 46:21.040
You boys wanna remedy this,
we can step outside right now.

46:21.920 --> 46:24.240
You gotta be kidding me,
you fat piece of shit.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.960
- You little son of a bitch.
- Get off of me! Get off!

46:28.200 --> 46:29.160
- Come on.
- Calm down!

46:29.320 --> 46:30.720
Come on, calm down.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.040
Come on.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.720
Back away there and let Miss Ida
through with that food, will you?

46:36.880 --> 46:38.200
God almighty.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.120
Get over there and drink that coffee
before it gets cold, boy.

46:41.320 --> 46:42.640
How you boys running today?

46:43.200 --> 46:46.040
- Anything, Mike?
- How's my boy?

46:46.240 --> 46:47.200
No. Thanks, Ida.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.000
Sit down, David, sit down.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.160
Cool down, fellas.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.720
Listen, fellas, I want you all to know

46:54.880 --> 46:57.840
that there's not a damn thing
personal in this.

46:59.040 --> 47:00.880
Now, where's your friend?

47:01.280 --> 47:02.960
- Which one?
- Come on, Mike.

47:03.120 --> 47:05.280
The one with the attitude.

47:06.360 --> 47:08.040
Well, if you mean Dallis,
I don't know.

47:10.600 --> 47:13.200
We got a proposition for y'all.

47:13.400 --> 47:16.120
I want you to take
a lie-detector test.

47:16.640 --> 47:20.760
If you're telling the truth,
it'll sure strengthen your cause.

47:23.720 --> 47:25.120
We'll think about it.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.760
I got a good man
right here in the state.

47:26.920 --> 47:29.520
I mean, you could take it today,
tomorrow, any time that y'all feel...

47:29.680 --> 47:31.760
I said, we'll think about it.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.400
Why don't we have a little talk,
Mike, huh?

47:37.560 --> 47:39.200
Outside.

47:54.680 --> 47:57.920
Young Greg told us the truth
about the cut on Dallis' hand.

47:59.600 --> 48:01.880
It wasn't a paper cut, was it?

48:02.400 --> 48:05.200
He had an altercation with Travis
on the day of the disappearance.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.400
Isn't that true?

48:08.720 --> 48:10.240
I guess.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.960
I think you're starting to get
a pretty good feel

48:14.120 --> 48:16.480
for who I am, Rogers.

48:16.680 --> 48:19.960
I've been at this line of work
for a long time.

48:20.200 --> 48:22.040
You know what's starting to bug me?

48:23.320 --> 48:27.560
I think maybe
you didn't kill your friend.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.040
But for the life of me,

48:30.320 --> 48:33.120
I can't figure why you're covering up.

48:41.160 --> 48:44.320
- What the heck's he want?
- I don't know. Let's go.

48:44.480 --> 48:47.680
- Where we going?
- To find Dallis.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.880
Dallis? I thought you don't know
where he is.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.680
I lied.

48:56.840 --> 49:01.360
All right, I'm gonna raise you 10
on this. I'm gonna raise you...

49:07.480 --> 49:09.640
Guys, just speak American, please.

49:12.320 --> 49:14.080
Well, fellas.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.320
Well?

49:46.440 --> 49:49.520
I heard what's been happening in
that stupid little Mormon town of yours.

49:49.680 --> 49:52.080
I told you chuckleheads that story
was never gonna work, didn't I?

49:52.280 --> 49:54.640
Yeah, well, you know they took away
our logging contract, Dallis?

49:54.840 --> 49:56.160
Do you know that, huh?

49:56.360 --> 49:58.920
Well, that figures. They're a bunch
of chickenshit assholes.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.000
Yeah, well, speaking of chickenshit,

50:01.200 --> 50:03.000
where you been?

50:03.760 --> 50:05.640
I been around.

50:06.040 --> 50:07.680
You knew where to find me,
didn't you, Mike?

50:07.840 --> 50:10.280
Davis and Watters
are looking for you, Dallis.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.160
They know about
your criminal record.

50:12.360 --> 50:14.080
They know you lied
about how you hurt your hand.

50:14.240 --> 50:16.680
- They know you're full of it...
- You're full of information today,

50:16.840 --> 50:18.920
- aren't you, choirboy?
- Well, it don't make us look good

50:19.080 --> 50:22.880
- when you don't show up. No, it don't!
- Well, that's too goddamn bad!

50:24.120 --> 50:26.240
They want us to take
a lie-detector test.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.600
I wanna know
what you think about it.

50:31.120 --> 50:33.520
You wanna know
what I think about it?

50:33.720 --> 50:35.360
That's right.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.720
I'll tell you what I think.

50:39.240 --> 50:42.160
I think those devices
are very dangerous, man.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.560
That machine says you lied,

50:43.720 --> 50:45.760
it don't matter if you
told the truth, you lied.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.040
It might clear us, though.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.200
Oh, it might clear you.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.280
You know,

50:59.480 --> 51:01.560
they don't need a body
to press murder charges,

51:01.760 --> 51:05.880
did you know that?
Did you know that, huh?

51:06.040 --> 51:08.920
And they ain't never gonna find Travis.
You know that and I know it, right?

51:09.080 --> 51:12.160
So then the pressure's gonna be on
Davis and Watters to solve the case.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.320
And who do you think
they're gonna zero in on, huh?

51:14.480 --> 51:16.720
What, you, choirboy?

51:16.840 --> 51:19.520
And God'll send
a swarm of locusts down on them.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.440
And you,
Mr. Pillar-of-the-Community?

51:21.640 --> 51:23.360
No, I don't think so.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.240
No, the question is,

51:26.400 --> 51:28.920
how long before you boys decide
to save your lily-white asses

51:29.120 --> 51:30.360
and point the finger at me?

51:30.560 --> 51:32.320
- That's a load of crud...
- No, that's exactly

51:32.480 --> 51:34.560
- the way it's gonna be!
- That's a load!

51:36.040 --> 51:39.400
If we decide to take
this lie-detector test,

51:41.200 --> 51:42.240
we all take it.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.000
Don't you point your finger at me.

51:44.200 --> 51:45.640
All right, Mike. Come on!

51:45.880 --> 51:48.760
All right! All right!

51:50.080 --> 51:51.600
All right. Go.

51:53.760 --> 51:56.720
- Get away from me.
- All right, Dallis, you just be there.

51:58.720 --> 52:01.120
That was nice, that felt good.

52:04.120 --> 52:05.720
Just be there.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.720
Be there.

52:13.960 --> 52:16.520
<i>The story has drawn</i>
<i>international attention,</i>

52:21.160 --> 52:23.520
I've had enough of this.
I'm going down there.

53:17.480 --> 53:20.200
<i>A concerned town has called</i>
<i>a meeting tonight at their church</i>

53:20.360 --> 53:22.560
<i>to discuss these very questions.</i>

53:22.760 --> 53:24.400
<i>Though they won't</i>
<i>comment publicly,</i>

53:24.880 --> 53:29.880
<i>"homicide" is a word that is heard</i>
<i>on the lips of local investigators.</i>

53:30.040 --> 53:32.320
"Ray Melendez", "Action News".

53:32.520 --> 53:34.600
<i>Thanks, Ray. In other news...</i>

53:34.840 --> 53:37.960
Sheriff, we've been
combing those woods for days now.

53:38.160 --> 53:39.920
The town's getting a bad name.

53:40.520 --> 53:43.480
My kids are scared
from all this silly UFO nonsense...

53:43.680 --> 53:46.000
...and all these strangers
wandering around asking questions.

53:46.160 --> 53:48.760
What are you
gonna do about it, sheriff?

53:48.920 --> 53:49.880
Yes, ma'am.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.640
Miss Sarah, everybody's
awful concerned about this.

53:52.840 --> 53:54.600
Nobody's more concerned
than me and my men.

53:54.760 --> 53:57.240
They're working 24 hours a day
on this matter.

53:57.800 --> 54:00.760
We wanna get back to normal
in this town, if we can.

54:00.960 --> 54:03.600
One thing I want you to know,
we've asked those young men

54:03.760 --> 54:05.840
to take a lie-detector test.

54:06.560 --> 54:07.800
And they flatly refused.

54:07.960 --> 54:09.880
What good's that gonna do,
anyhow?

54:10.080 --> 54:12.440
Now, if there's been foul play,
we need to know now

54:12.600 --> 54:14.520
that our town is safe to live in.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.040
And why haven't you made
any arrests?

54:17.240 --> 54:19.120
Come on, Nate, think it through.

54:19.520 --> 54:22.400
There's not one scintilla of evidence

54:22.600 --> 54:24.440
that a crime's even been committed.

54:24.600 --> 54:27.360
Everybody's got a pretty good idea
what really happened.

54:27.560 --> 54:30.480
Hey, hold it.
You just hold it right there.

54:39.880 --> 54:42.280
What are you people trying to say?

54:43.640 --> 54:44.800
What are you saying, George?

54:45.160 --> 54:47.160
Are you saying I killed
Travis Walton?

54:51.520 --> 54:53.680
You really disappoint me.

54:55.480 --> 54:57.240
I went to school with you, Nate.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.280
My Mary, she's at school
with your kids.

55:01.440 --> 55:04.840
Jack, Larry,

55:05.480 --> 55:07.120
Mrs. Pratt.

55:07.360 --> 55:09.120
What are you doing?

55:12.640 --> 55:14.720
I miss Travis.

55:15.680 --> 55:19.200
Just like you. I miss him bad.

55:20.360 --> 55:23.360
But I... I can't help what happened.

55:23.520 --> 55:27.160
I... I can't change what I saw.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.800
I wish I could.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.200
I wish... I wish we had him back.

55:31.360 --> 55:35.200
I... I wish I knew...
I wish I knew he was okay.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.440
But that's out of my hands.

55:39.960 --> 55:42.440
And so is what you think of me.

55:45.320 --> 55:48.960
We've been telling you the truth
since the beginning.

55:49.120 --> 55:51.480
And now we're ready to prove it.

55:51.720 --> 55:53.480
We'll take your damn
lie-detector test.

55:53.640 --> 55:56.800
You set it up, we'll be there.
You go ahead.

55:56.960 --> 56:02.520
And if any of you got anything to say
about me or my crew,

56:02.720 --> 56:06.640
you say it now,
and you say it to my face.

56:50.200 --> 56:52.120
Mike, whose idea
was the lie-detector test?

56:52.320 --> 56:53.440
Was that yours or the sheriff's?

56:53.600 --> 56:56.160
- Did you kill Travis?
- Did you really see aliens up there?

56:56.320 --> 56:59.440
- If you killed Travis Walton...
- Give him some room.

56:59.600 --> 57:04.240
Give him some room.
Back off, back off.

57:08.440 --> 57:11.720
You were told to be here at 9:00.

57:11.880 --> 57:13.880
Yeah, well, we weren't.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.400
Fellas, meet Cy Gilson.

57:15.560 --> 57:19.440
Came all the way from Phoenix
to be sure that you get a good test.

57:19.600 --> 57:20.800
Yeah, and how do we know that?

57:21.720 --> 57:23.160
I guarantee it.

57:23.360 --> 57:24.320
Words are cheap.

57:24.520 --> 57:28.000
Yeah, you say the test will be good.
How do we know it's gonna be fair?

57:28.160 --> 57:29.720
I give my word.

57:29.880 --> 57:32.080
We can't trust anyone, man.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.960
Everything we say
has been twisted all to hell.

57:35.120 --> 57:37.080
That's for sure.
This whole town wants to see us fall,

57:37.280 --> 57:38.680
Blake, you know that.

57:38.840 --> 57:41.680
Frankly, I don't care
whether you pass or not.

57:41.840 --> 57:43.680
If you're lying,
my machine will show it.

57:43.840 --> 57:46.160
If you're clean, it'll show that too.

57:46.320 --> 57:47.800
How do we know
you ain't been bought off

57:47.960 --> 57:49.800
to make us look bad?

57:49.960 --> 57:52.320
Cy Gilson is the best there is, boys.

57:52.520 --> 57:53.680
You're lucky to have him.

57:54.280 --> 57:58.720
Well, if you say so,
that's good enough for me.

58:00.400 --> 58:03.200
Point is, you can trust him.

58:03.960 --> 58:06.040
Yeah, well, I trust you, Blake.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.640
Will you give us your word
this test will be fair?

58:08.800 --> 58:11.240
That's easy. You got it.

58:17.680 --> 58:18.880
All right.

58:19.880 --> 58:22.400
Is your name
Gregory Thomas Hayes?

58:22.560 --> 58:24.320
Yes.

58:26.600 --> 58:28.960
Were you born in Corona,
New Mexico?

58:29.120 --> 58:31.000
Yes.

58:33.480 --> 58:35.760
Are you currently single?

58:35.920 --> 58:37.760
Yes.

58:37.920 --> 58:40.680
Is my shirt white?

58:43.240 --> 58:45.360
Face around front.

58:46.160 --> 58:49.560
- Some of it's white.
- Yes or no.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.640
No.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.040
Five days ago, about sundown,
on Rim Road, north of Turkey Creek,

58:58.240 --> 59:01.120
did you see an unidentified light
just above the tree line?

59:03.080 --> 59:04.240
Yes.

59:04.400 --> 59:07.240
Did you see an object hovering
above the clearing?

59:07.400 --> 59:09.040
Yes.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.800
Was it saucer-shaped?

59:13.920 --> 59:15.680
Sort of.

59:15.920 --> 59:20.000
I don't... I don't... I never seen
anything exactly like it before.

59:20.160 --> 59:21.880
Yes or no?

59:24.120 --> 59:25.360
I'd have to say no.

59:28.840 --> 59:33.040
Did you see Travis Walton
approach the object on foot?

59:33.200 --> 59:36.040
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

59:37.400 --> 59:40.720
Did you see a bolt of blue-green light
envelop Travis Walton?

59:40.920 --> 59:44.960
Yeah. Man, I told them.
It exploded all around him.

59:45.680 --> 59:48.520
Did you believe Travis was killed
by the ray of light?

59:50.000 --> 59:51.200
Now, how do I know?

59:51.720 --> 59:54.000
I just know that I didn't kill him.

59:55.040 --> 59:57.560
Did you personally dislike
Travis Walton?

59:57.720 --> 59:59.040
Now, what kind of question is that?

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.400
A simple yes or no will do.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.440
Yes.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.280
And no.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.760
Have you withheld
any pertinent information

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.240
regarding the disappearance
of Travis Walton?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.600
No.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.720
Did you create this incident
to get out of your logging contract?

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.120
No.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.840
Did you or any of your crew
murder Travis Walton?

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.640
Absolutely not.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.080
Well, what's the word?

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.920
Well, the results of one of the tests
was unusual.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.680
It was inconclusive.
We'll have to try again tomorrow.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.360
What about the other ones?
What's the word on them?

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.760
The process is still ongoing.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.480
We never discuss the results
till all the testing is complete.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.920
Sorry, fellas.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.160
Come back down here
in the morning, 9:00 sharp.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.360
- No.
- What?

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.320
I said, no.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.040
Look, we did what we said we'd do.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.080
We... We... We came in here
like guinea pigs and let you test us.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.120
But that's it. That...
We've had enough.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.840
I ain't coming back again.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.560
You're saying that you're no longer
willing to cooperate?

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.080
That's all we do, is cooperate.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.280
And all we get back
from you is grief.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.720
- Mike, we need a little bit of time...
- No!

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.440
Blake, I'm sick of this shit!

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.040
You wanna press charges?
You go ahead. You do it now!

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.200
We told you everything we know.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.600
And if that's not good enough,
that's too damn bad,

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.160
because that's all there is.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.280
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.920
Well, Dallis' chart was
all over the place.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.240
He must have been really keyed up
or scared or whatever.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.480
It's unreadable.
Completely unreadable.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.720
As for the other four, see for yourself.
They're pretty much all the same.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.960
What are you saying, Cy?

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:44.280
Well, Blake, my charts don't lie.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.080
You ask me,
those boys are telling the truth.

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.560
Do you plan on spending the night?

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.840
Yeah. I was thinking about it.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.920
Why, is that gonna be a problem?

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.360
No. Do whatever you want.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.320
Hello?

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.200
Whoever's doing this, it's not funny.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.040
I can't believe this.
Another crank call.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.760
We've been getting
two and three in the day.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.760
Now we're getting them
at all hours of the night.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.840
Now, let me get that.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.680
Yeah, who is this?

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.920
<i>I have a collect call</i>
<i>from Travis Walton.</i>

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.640
- "Will you accept the charges?"
- You know, just hang up the phone.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.600
- I'll accept it.
- "Go ahead, sir."

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.520
<i>Mike.</i>

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.000
Travis?

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.040
<i>Help me.</i>

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.240
I've been through Heber
a bunch of times.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.920
I don't remember any phone booth.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.280
Well, he said he was calling
from a gas station or something.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.640
Are you sure it was him?

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.160
What's that over there?

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.000
Mike, I think this just might be
someone's idea of a sick joke.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:34.080
Wait a minute,
there's a gas station north of here.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.120
- I don't think so, Mike.
- About eight or nine miles.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.000
I know so.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.440
Well, you were right
about the gas station at least.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.840
I know that was Travis.
It sounded just like him.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.200
Stop. Wait. What is that?

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.920
Stop, Mike. What is that?
Right there. Stop!

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.480
Pull over, Mike! Pull over!

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.360
- David, grab that flashlight.
- Got it.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.680
Travis? It's him!

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.960
- Travis! Travis, are you okay?
- Travis!

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.680
Travis?

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.720
- Travis?
- Travis, it's us.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.120
- Hey, man.
- Travis, what's wrong?

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.880
- Hey, baby bro.
- Hey, Travis, it's Mike.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.000
Hey, it's your partner,
you remember me?

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:39.040
Travis, your partner.
MT Motors. Harleys.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.120
You cold, man?

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.520
Take it easy, bro. Take it easy.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.440
Don't try to talk, man.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.640
Travis.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.880
Water! Water!
Somebody get him some water!

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:55.480
- Hey, man, it's gonna be okay.
- Water.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.240
Everything's gonna be
all right, Travis.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.560
Hey, Dana's right here.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.520
Travis. Travis.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.840
Travis, it's okay.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.920
This must be them.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.320
They're here.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.240
Mike...

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.880
Mike?

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.600
Five days, man.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.160
It's been five days.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.520
Travis, everybody's been looking
for you.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.680
- Hundreds of people.
- Come on, hurry up.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.520
I think a lot of prayers
have been answered.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.840
I can't believe we found this place.
Where is he?

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.920
We're gonna need a urine sample.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.360
Urine sample?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.520
Mike, don't let them touch him.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.000
- Back off.
- It's okay.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.480
Back off, man. He knows his stuff.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.560
It's a wise thing you called.
This is a very critical time.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.400
Hey, come on in here. Get a picture.
Get some pictures here. Pictures.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.120
Mr. Walton?

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.000
Mr. Walton, my name
is Jarvis Powell.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.399
Now, can you...? Can you tell us
how long you've been back?

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.319
- Let him.
- Here, get this thing started.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.439
Hey, we need to get him to a hospital!

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.160
- Quiet, please.
- Dan! Calm down, man.

01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:32.640
- Mr. Walton.
- Calm down, man!

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.240
Mr. Walton. Mr. Walton. Back up.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:38.080
Mr. Walton, did you make contact
with aliens?

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.600
Were you taken to another planet?
To a mother ship?

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:44.960
- How did they communicate with you?
- Just stop it! Just leave him alone.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.960
Communicate? What is this
man-in-the-moon stuff?

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.479
Okay, look, you've got two choices.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.319
You can either be quiet
or step outside.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.160
Dana, give this guy a chance.

01:08:56.319 --> 01:09:00.080
Mr. Walton, can you tell me
what they look like?

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.200
Can you tell me how many
of them there were?

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:06.080
Were you...?
Were you given food? Injections?

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.560
- All right, that's enough, mister.
- Mike.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.160
It's important the entire world
learns of your experience.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:12.720
That's enough, Mike. Come on!

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.200
Look, I am asking you...

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.319
I'm asking all of you,
just let us do our job!

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:18.240
No! You have done your thing.
He's not answering.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.640
You can't come between me
and my brother!

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.160
Get out of here! No, no...
He's seeing something!

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:26.560
He's seeing something!

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.600
Travis, what do you see?
What do you see?!

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.640
- Get him out of here!
- He sees something!

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.399
He's seeing something!

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.800
All right, here we go. Ready? Lift.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:48.240
Okay, let's go, guys.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.840
The doctor's down in ICU.
We'll page him.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:54.240
Hang in there, pal.
You're gonna be fine.

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.200
He's rolling the eyes a little bit.
Better watch him.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.000
You're gonna be okay.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.360
I wonder what happened to this one.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.480
Okay, watch the corner.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.880
Lab tech's on the way, doctor.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.080
Secure it.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:40.280
- Did he lose consciousness?
- No, he didn't.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.160
- Pulse?
- Are you okay?

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.760
Hey, can you talk to me?

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.160
Hey, man, how you doing?

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:31.120
Hey, I'm not supposed
to be in here.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.840
Your ma's out front.
She can't wait to see you.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.040
But they said we weren't
supposed to be coming in here.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.200
I guess they don't think
you're ready to see visitors yet.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.720
Boy, was I glad you showed up.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.120
I really missed you, buddy.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.080
You know, they had a search party
out for you for days.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.040
They thought...

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.040
They thought that
we had killed you, man.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.640
They were ready to lynch us.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.360
Can you imagine that?

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.720
These jerks actually thought
we killed you.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.360
Kate and I aren't doing so good.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.320
Not that we were ever doing
that great, but...

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.480
I don't think we're gonna make it.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.000
But Dana, she sure loves you.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.720
She's been a basket case.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.320
I was pretty broken up too.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:41.280
When I came back up there
and you were gone...

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.840
...I can't tell you how awful I felt.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.440
What?

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.920
When you came back?

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.080
Travis, we thought you were dead.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:15.720
I mean, it blasted you with the light.

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.440
And the guys, they got all scared,

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.480
and they started hollering
and everything and...

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.840
You left me there.

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.160
Well, come on, Travis.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.400
I mean, what did you expect
me to do?

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.680
I came right back for you.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.600
You son of a bitch.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.800
If you hadn't gotten out of the truck
in the first place,

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.200
none of this would've happened.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.960
No one is allowed in here.

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.960
Yeah, I was just leaving.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.480
You know, Travis, I believe you.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.680
And I know we'd have a lot
to talk about.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.800
Maybe one day we'll have
a two-way conversation.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.920
Just you and me.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.760
- Thanks, Dr. Cayle.
- I really mean it, Travis.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.960
If you need me, please call.
I'm here for you.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.520
You can always find me here.
Remember that.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.040
Good luck.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.120
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.480
Look, here he comes.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.960
Mr. Walton, please give me a
statement about your UFO experience.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.880
Give me a statement.
Just take some time, please.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.480
- Tell us what you saw.
- What happened up there, exactly?

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.840
Mr. Walton, is this some kind of
hoax that got out of hand?

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.200
Give us a statement.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.000
Travis, get in the car
and lock the door.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.520
Come on, why don't you come clean
about where you disappeared to.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.880
What is this rumor about drugs
being involved? Is that true?

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.120
Travis? Please.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.080
Come on, look over here.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.520
He's not answering questions today.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.040
- Travis, can we have your autograph?
- Autograph?

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.520
Yeah, you're famous.
You've been to space.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.920
- Gee, thanks.
- Cool.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.600
Autographs.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.200
You've become quite the celebrity.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.560
You enjoying it?

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:15.320
Word is, the tabloids are gonna

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.120
put up quite a hunk of cash
for your story rights.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.800
You've hit the big time.
Congratulations.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.160
Who are you?

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.080
Frank Watters,
state investigator for the CIB.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.960
I've been on the case
since you disappeared.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.480
Where you been the last five days?

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.560
L... I can't remember.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.280
Dr. Wilson over at
the hospital tells me

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.080
you went without food and water
all that time.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.400
Was it worth it?

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.280
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.280
You don't, huh?

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:55.840
Well, I can see your memory
isn't quite there yet.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.560
So, what do you say we just give it
a little more time, huh?

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.640
I'm a patient man.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.400
You decide you got
something to tell me,

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.360
I can be reached through
the sheriff's office.

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.080
Oh, welcome home, Travis.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.120
Good day, ma'am.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.120
What was that all about?

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.040
Take me home. Please.

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:38.360
- Hey, hey! Look who I found outside!
- Hey!

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:44.440
Good to see you. Good to see you.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.960
- Yeah, it's good to have you back.
- Good to see you, Travis.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.720
I'm sorry, but, well, Mike's
probably not coming.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.080
Hey, Travis, man, look at this.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.320
We made the paper.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.080
Frank Watters was on the radio
this morning.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.360
Now he's saying polygraphs
are inconclusive.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.960
He thinks we're all lying.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.400
I bet Watters still thinks we killed you.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.440
You all right, guy?

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.240
Everybody, come on, let's eat.
Everything's all ready.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.560
Let's eat.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.880
I bet you're hot and tired
of that hospital food, huh?

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.680
Let's get some food.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.400
Come on, Travis.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.160
Come on, Trav,
let's get some chow.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.480
Whoa, watch it, there!

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.880
Let me get you some fruit cocktail.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.120
Okay, Nancy, do you want
some of this?

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.320
There's turkey there and cranberries.
Get yourself in here and get some.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.800
Where's Travis?

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.720
Oh, okay. I'll talk to him.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.160
- Pretty good grub.
- Travis?

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.520
Travis?

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.200
Travis?

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.120
Honey?

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.920
Travis? Travis?

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.280
What's going on?

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.040
Travis, what's wrong? Travis?

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.960
Travis, are you okay?

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.360
Travis, what's wrong?

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.160
Travis? Travis? Travis?

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.760
Travis! Travis!

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.280
Space suits.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.920
It's Dr. Cayle, Travis.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.800
Your brother and Dana brought you
to my office. We're all here.

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:39.760
I know how difficult this has been.

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:45.280
Travis.

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:49.160
Are you okay?

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.960
I love you, honey.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.880
First unsolved case, Frank?

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.080
Oh, I wouldn't say that,
exactly, sheriff.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.960
Just waiting for the real truth
to come out.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.120
Well, that doctor
seemed to think it was real.

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:04.920
She's forgetting the fact that Travis
had five days to dream up

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.760
and rehearse
this cockamamie story of his.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.720
What are you getting at, Frank?

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:12.920
It just seems to me that this whole
thing is a very well-planned

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:15.440
- and executed hoax.
- Hoax?

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:18.240
For God's sake, why would
they wanna do that?

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:21.000
To get some attention.
Could be as simple as that.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:24.920
- Oh, I don't know, Frank. I mean...
- Yeah, well, one of these days,

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:28.480
they're gonna slip up. When they do,

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.680
I'm on my way back to Snowflake.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.480
All the way from Montana?

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.760
From the frigging North Pole
if I have to.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.640
I'll see you then, sheriff.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.640
Aren't you gonna be late for work?

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.840
What?

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.680
No. We're gonna have breakfast now.
We can't play ball anymore.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:21.160
Come on, get your legs
in there, Michael.

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.080
Okay. We'll leave the ball here.
But you have some cereal, okay?

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.240
- How's my girl?
- Okay. You gotta go to work.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.520
- Yeah. I'll see you.
- Okay.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.520
Bye, sweetheart. Want to have
some juice?

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.120
Yeah, you gotta have your juice
and cereal. Say, "Bye-bye, Daddy."

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.560
Bye-bye, Daddy.

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.400
- Bye-bye.
- Yeah.

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:28.200
Mike?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.520
Travis.

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.080
You're looking good.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.720
Hey, I heard you moved up here.

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.480
Been a long time.
What is it, two years?

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.400
It's two and a half.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.400
We gotta talk.

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.800
Well, what do we got to talk about?

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.680
Come on, Mike. Let's go for a ride.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.640
You wanna get out?

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.800
Why did you bring me here?

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.480
You know, I don't like this place much.

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:43.320
Hey, Mike...

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.960
...neither do I.

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:49.840
In fact, I haven't had
a decent night's sleep since...

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:52.920
Since I last saw you.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.440
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.280
So it bothers you too?

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.960
What do you think?

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.440
I saw your girls the other day.
They're getting big.

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:33.480
They miss you.
Everybody misses you.

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.280
You know, you're about
to be an uncle again.

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.400
Again?

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.440
You mean you never heard?

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.760
Michael's almost 2
and Dana's three months gone.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.640
Michael?

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:49.320
That's all right.

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:56.800
So why are we up here, Travis?

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:05.560
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about what happened.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:12.960
Hell, it was all my fault, Mike.
I never should've got out of the truck.

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.920
Don't be ridiculous.
What happened happened.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.120
- We can't change that.
- Well...

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:24.360
...whatever you did, it's okay.
Understand?

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.520
It's cool.

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.320
Same goes for you.

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.280
Let's get going.
You gotta go to work and...

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:48.600
And what?

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:51.520
I'd like to get the hell out of here
before they come back.

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.240
Oh, they won't be back.

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.520
I don't think they liked me.
