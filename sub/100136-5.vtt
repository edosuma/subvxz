Alyssa?

01:46.720 --> 01:48.600
Hello?

01:50.760 --> 01:52.040
Hello?

01:57.280 --> 01:58.280
Morning.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
Morning.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.560
You look nice.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.640
I'm not your nan, James.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.720
There's no one here. The guy's gone.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.560
I'm sure we can use his phone.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.200
I don't think he'd mind.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.200
Bonnie?

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
Are you awake?

03:00.520 --> 03:02.160
I'm not wearing any clothes.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.640
Okay.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.160
The mechanic's on her way.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.600
Already?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.600
Uh...

03:11.640 --> 03:13.680
Yeah. Will you be ready to leave soon?

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
Yes.

03:16.560 --> 03:20.120
I'm so sorry to ask,
but could we borrow some cash for the car?

03:21.000 --> 03:22.480
I promise we'll pay you back.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.000
- Is there someone else in there?
- Oh, my God.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.600
She had sex with the man.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.360
- What?
- The owner from last night.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.600
Thank you. Like I said...

03:59.400 --> 04:01.280
Why would she have sex with him?

04:02.240 --> 04:05.360
Her boyfriend died.
She's got low self-esteem.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.080
People do all kinds of shit
when they feel bad about themselves.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.720
You two pissed anyone off?

04:12.800 --> 04:13.920
What?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.840
That... is not an accident.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.240
Probably that guy at the car pound.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.760
Or Bonnie.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.200
- What?
- I'm joking.

04:30.600 --> 04:31.640
Where now?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.080
Um... turn left.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.240
Are you feeling okay, Bonnie?

04:45.320 --> 04:47.480
I think I drank too much last night.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.720
Where are we going?

04:51.720 --> 04:52.720
My sister's.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.080
You didn't mention your sister.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.520
You didn't ask.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.760
Where does she live?
The middle of fucking nowhere?

05:02.320 --> 05:03.560
It's, like, 20 minutes.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.640
How did you sleep?

05:09.440 --> 05:10.440
Okay.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.080
- We know what you did.
- Alyssa.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.120
- What?
- The man.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.480
The motel man.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.480
- He bought me a drink.
- You don't have to tell us.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.640
Then what?

05:23.320 --> 05:25.440
- No one's judging you.
- What?

05:25.520 --> 05:26.960
You just slept with him.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.480
I don't care. You had your reasons.
We've all done stuff we regret.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.440
I'm really hot. Can I open up the window?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.520
Why don't you take off your polo neck?

05:42.200 --> 05:43.240
I think I'm gonna be si...

05:45.560 --> 05:48.320
Jesus!
She must have had a skinful last night.

05:49.440 --> 05:50.760
<i>This was my chance.</i>

05:51.200 --> 05:52.480
<i>I had to say something.</i>

05:52.560 --> 05:53.560
Uh...

05:54.520 --> 05:55.800
Speaking of last night...

05:57.240 --> 05:58.240
What about it?

05:59.680 --> 06:02.000
Well, how do you feel?

06:04.520 --> 06:09.080
I feel like we're literally watching
a stranger be sick into a ditch.

06:10.120 --> 06:10.960
Okay.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.840
So I probably don't want
to talk about it.

06:12.920 --> 06:13.920
Okay.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.760
God! How long is she gonna take?

06:23.760 --> 06:24.880
Are we in a rush?

06:25.320 --> 06:27.680
- I need to get back today.
- What?

06:28.720 --> 06:29.720
Yeah.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.240
<i>I didn't know
I was gonna say that.</i>

06:34.040 --> 06:35.040
Well...

06:35.680 --> 06:36.920
we can't just leave her.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.400
She helped us out with the car
and everything.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.000
Okay, whatever.
I just wish that she'd hurry up.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.440
I think she's finished.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.200
Are you feeling better, Bonnie?

07:17.280 --> 07:18.680
I need to go to a chemist.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.160
Do you think it's a bit weird
she didn't mention her sister?

07:53.720 --> 07:54.720
I think it is.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.680
She could've just stayed there last night.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.120
Isn't it a bit weird...

08:01.200 --> 08:02.080
- James.
- Yeah?

08:02.160 --> 08:05.520
She's weird. She does weird things.
It's not that interesting.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.760
<i>Sometimes,
even when I'm not looking at James,</i>

08:09.840 --> 08:11.400
<i>I know what his face is doing.</i>

08:12.960 --> 08:14.960
<i>Right now, it's all anxious and sad.</i>

08:15.400 --> 08:17.880
- Alyssa.
- We should get money.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.240
For Bonnie.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.320
Yep.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.120
<i>I wondered
if Alyssa just needed some time.</i>

08:28.040 --> 08:29.040
<i>And space.</i>

08:31.320 --> 08:33.000
<i>I should never have kissed him.</i>

08:36.160 --> 08:37.960
- Morning.
- Yes.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.120
How can I help you?

08:41.440 --> 08:42.600
I need painkillers.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.280
The strongest ones.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.400
Right. Can you tell me what they're for?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Why?

08:49.840 --> 08:51.760
- Sorry?
- Why do you need to know?

08:51.840 --> 08:53.720
Because that's my job.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.840
Back pain?

08:58.360 --> 09:00.400
Yeah. It's very bad.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.160
Yeah.
There you go.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.600
Uh... no more than six in 24 hours,

09:10.680 --> 09:12.800
and you need to eat before you take them.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.480
- Fine.
- If you don't, you'll be sick.

09:16.560 --> 09:17.560
Already been sick.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.240
Are you okay?

09:22.480 --> 09:23.480
What?

09:24.520 --> 09:25.680
You're bleeding.

09:25.760 --> 09:26.760
No, I'm not.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.840
Has someone hurt you?

09:30.800 --> 09:32.040
Do you need help?

09:32.120 --> 09:33.120
What?

09:35.720 --> 09:37.360
There's a refuge near here.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.080
Can I just pay?

09:39.160 --> 09:40.200
Is he outside?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.760
Where is he? You can tell me.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.800
- He's in the motel.
- What motel?

09:49.760 --> 09:52.920
Look, I'm a feminist, okay?

10:07.880 --> 10:08.880
Thank you.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.040
Is there a toilet here?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.040
It's just...

10:50.240 --> 10:53.040
- Wonder what's going on.
- You should go and check on her.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.256
- I think she wanted to be alone.
- She's been ages.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.280
She's hungover.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.120
Probably having a flapjack or something.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.080
In a chemist?

11:01.160 --> 11:04.760
They do healthy ones made out of prunes,
and seeds, and things.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.840
Just go and check on her!

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
What?

11:10.400 --> 11:12.760
<i>I was starting to remember
what Alyssa could be like.</i>

11:19.320 --> 11:20.760
Why can't you ask nicely?

11:29.040 --> 11:31.360
<i>I think maybe
there's something wrong with me.</i>

11:44.640 --> 11:48.800
<i>♪ But what can I do? ♪</i>

11:49.360 --> 11:53.880

12:07.920 --> 12:09.080
- Morning.
- Morning.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.360
Uh, where is she?

12:12.960 --> 12:13.960
Who?

12:14.440 --> 12:17.080
The woman.
My friend, I saw her walk in here.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.240
I don't know what you're talking about.
No one's come in.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.720
- But I just saw...
- Shame on you.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.120
- What?
- Bonnie's disappeared.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.640
She's actually vanished.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.520
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.360
- Really?
- Yes.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.760
I need to eat some food.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.920
Now.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.960
- It's quite early for lunch.
- Yeah.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.000
Did you not have breakfast?

13:10.080 --> 13:12.440
Uh... no.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.400
Do you want to put the plates down?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.640
<i>I never knew
if Alyssa was aware of it,</i>

13:20.720 --> 13:23.840
<i>but she could make a room feel colder
than it actually was.</i>

13:26.080 --> 13:27.840
<i>I used to really like food.</i>

13:37.720 --> 13:39.480
This is for you.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Thank you.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.480
This is called a Lazy Susan.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.880
<i>I often found that tension
could be diffused with facts.</i>

13:52.960 --> 13:55.080
So you can pass
the food round more easily.

13:55.920 --> 13:58.320
- They're actually...
- Fuck's sake, James.

13:58.840 --> 13:59.920
<i>Not always, though.</i>

14:03.120 --> 14:04.120
What?

14:04.720 --> 14:06.880
- Look, is something up with you?
- Alyssa.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.080
You can tell us if you want.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.360
<i>And then we can all go home.</i>

14:12.440 --> 14:13.720
My boyfriend was murdered.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
Shit.

14:16.960 --> 14:17.960
Yeah.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.400
- Sorry.
- Are you?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.120
- Yeah.
- Why?

14:23.240 --> 14:25.520
Because it's what you say.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.400
When someone gets murdered?

14:27.480 --> 14:28.680
I think so.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.040
Both my parents are dead.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.200
Were they murdered?

14:37.280 --> 14:39.600
Can you stop saying
the word "murdered" please?

14:40.040 --> 14:41.040
Are you okay?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.600
I'm fine. I just need some water.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.680
- Are you coming back?
- What?

14:46.560 --> 14:47.560
Nothing.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.080
This is my dad.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.360
My parents don't speak to me anymore.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.040
<i>There's definitely
something wrong with me.</i>

15:22.840 --> 15:23.680
What's wrong?

15:23.760 --> 15:26.600
- Are we actually near your sister's?
- We're close.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.880
Can we get some takeaway boxes, please?

16:03.040 --> 16:05.560
- Alyssa, what is the matter?
- Nothing is the matter, James.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.480
- Why did you kiss me?
- What?

16:07.560 --> 16:11.040
- Is it 'cause you felt sorry for me?
- No, James, I don't wanna talk about this.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.896
Is it because of everything
that happened to me?

16:12.920 --> 16:15.520
No. For God's sake, James,
not everything is about you.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.040
Why? Because it has to be about you?

16:17.440 --> 16:20.560
You can't... You can't kiss someone
and then be mean.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.200
It's confusing.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.160
Why? Are you 12?

16:24.240 --> 16:25.680
You dumped me, James.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.480
You dumped me in a letter,
like a Victorian.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.280
- Wait. No.
- No?

16:31.360 --> 16:32.760
- No.
- That's not what happened?

16:32.840 --> 16:35.680
No, it is,
but... I didn't mean it. It's just...

16:35.760 --> 16:36.760
What?

16:38.680 --> 16:40.040
Your mum...

16:40.640 --> 16:41.640
made me.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
What?

16:46.560 --> 16:47.720
She...

16:48.760 --> 16:50.440
She came to the hospital.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.640
She made me write you a letter.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.320
Right.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.920
Looking for something?

17:14.920 --> 17:15.760
Where is it?

17:15.840 --> 17:17.240
- What's your name?
- No.

17:23.080 --> 17:26.200
My name is Kevan. With an "A".

17:27.200 --> 17:28.480
What's going on?

17:28.560 --> 17:29.560
You can tell me.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.920
Did something happen to you?

17:32.680 --> 17:35.000
I... I understand, okay?

17:35.360 --> 17:36.360
I get it.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.000
How can you get it?

17:38.080 --> 17:40.361
- I know what you're going through.
- You've never met me.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.640
I know women like you.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.240
There's no one like me.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.800
I didn't call the police because
I didn't want to get you in trouble.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.000
Give me... my gun.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.280
Okay, you listen to me.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.280
Violence is <i>not</i> the answer.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.040
What if it is?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.800
- It isn't.
- What if it is?

18:01.880 --> 18:03.120
It isn't.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.560
What if it is?

18:06.640 --> 18:08.120
Let's just calm down here.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.720
- Has anyone ever killed someone you loved?
- No.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.240
Do you ever wake up in the night
feeling like your skin's been screaming

18:15.320 --> 18:17.320
'cause it misses someone so much?

18:18.560 --> 18:19.400
I'm asking.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.640
No.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.240
Then you don't get it.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.360
- Give me... the gun.
- I...

18:26.440 --> 18:27.720
Give me the gun!

18:30.440 --> 18:31.880
What?

18:33.520 --> 18:35.240
Please can you let me say sorry?

18:38.560 --> 18:39.560
Okay.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.600
I said "okay".

18:49.440 --> 18:50.440
Say it.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.200
Go on. Say sorry.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.816
Say sorry, and then I can say
it's okay, and everything's all right.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.600
That's what you want, isn't it?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.440
<i>That was exactly what I wanted.</i>

19:02.760 --> 19:03.640
No.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.680
It's not okay. It's just how it is.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.040
- It wasn't just you.
- What's that supposed to mean?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.400
Who had a bad time.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.520
It's not a competition.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.840
- I nearly died.
- Oh, apparently, it is.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.920
I nearly died!

19:29.360 --> 19:30.360
I know.

19:31.720 --> 19:32.720
I was there.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.680
I'm not the answer, James.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.480
<i>She was right.</i>

19:45.640 --> 19:46.640
<i>It was over.</i>

19:50.440 --> 19:51.680
What about Bonnie?

19:52.360 --> 19:53.360
Fuck Bonnie.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.560
Don't call the police.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.960
If you do,
I'll come back, and I'll kill you.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.040
I won't.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.200
What happened?

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
I was scared.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.560
You're scary.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.920
Okay.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.520
Good.
