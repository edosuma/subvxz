00:07.220 --> 00:10.920
Here it comes...
Ahhh!

00:12.160 --> 00:14.130
It's almost my turn.
My turn.

00:15.260 --> 00:17.030
Ahhh!

00:17.060 --> 00:19.830
Now, me! Ahhh!

00:19.870 --> 00:22.830
Who are we kidding? This is
just blowing hot air around.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.870
When is this heat gonna end?

00:26.310 --> 00:29.070
Jerry, honey, we need an air conditioner.

00:29.110 --> 00:32.180
We don't need air conditioning.
We've got armpit ice.

00:32.210 --> 00:35.010
See, it cools... Oh!

00:36.050 --> 00:38.850
...and deodorizes.

00:45.860 --> 00:48.030
This is the hottest summer ever.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.830
I was just standing in front
of the air conditioning display

00:50.860 --> 00:53.000
at the hardware store
until Old Man Greenwald

00:53.030 --> 00:54.830
yelled at me for not buying anything.

00:55.380 --> 00:58.200
So I bought you a screwdriver.
Happy Mother's Day.

00:59.070 --> 01:00.770
Oh, thanks, honey, I...

01:00.810 --> 01:03.010
I can use it to pry open
your father's wallet

01:03.040 --> 01:05.580
and buy us an air conditioner.

01:05.610 --> 01:08.710
Dad, can we please close up
and go to the beach?

01:08.750 --> 01:11.920
No. We are gonna
take advantage of this heat.

01:11.950 --> 01:15.820
We can cook the pastrami without
even turning the oven on.

01:17.690 --> 01:18.990
Justin, you're hogging the fan.

01:19.030 --> 01:22.590
Harper, you know what this heat
and humidity does to my sinuses.

01:22.630 --> 01:25.760
OK? I have to keep them properly
ventilated or I start to snort.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.930
There it is.

01:27.970 --> 01:32.070
Hey, guys. If anyone's looking for
me, I'll be outside at the beach.

01:33.810 --> 01:35.810
Oh no, he's delirious.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.740
He must've eaten one of those pastrami
sandwiches you're cooking on the roof.

01:46.020 --> 01:48.020
From street scene to beach scene!

01:48.050 --> 01:50.660
Ah, paradise.

Oh, hey, welcome to my own private beach.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.810
It's, uh... nice,
but it's missing something.

02:08.940 --> 02:10.910
The ocean?

02:10.940 --> 02:13.610
Good point.

02:13.650 --> 02:16.880
Oceans and seas, waves and tides...

02:18.750 --> 02:22.050
Fine. We'll close up the shop
and go to the beach.

02:23.590 --> 02:26.020
Babies.

Come on, Jerry. Hurry up.

03:26.990 --> 03:28.750
I want to get a good spot at the beach.

03:31.990 --> 03:34.530
I hope I didn't forget anything from home.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.690
I know what you forgot, Dad.

03:36.730 --> 03:38.930
The shirt that matches those shorts.

03:40.730 --> 03:43.700
Oh, those college boys.

03:43.740 --> 03:46.500
They're being so obvious.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.810
- I'm married!
- To me.

03:50.740 --> 03:51.880
This is gonna be so great.

03:51.910 --> 03:54.650
I can't wait to just sit
on the beach and read my book.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.880
Alex, feel free to elbow me
if any cute guys walk by.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.850
Ow! He wasn't that cute.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.720
I'll be down by the water,
convincing Boogie boarders

04:04.760 --> 04:06.760
they should wear helmets
and protective eyewear.

04:06.790 --> 04:10.630
Hey. Hey, man, check it out.
It's a fortune teller machine.

04:10.660 --> 04:13.500
Max, no!

04:13.530 --> 04:15.630
Never get a fortune from one of these.

04:15.670 --> 04:17.800
For humans, it's a harmless arcade game,

04:17.839 --> 04:20.670
but for wizards,
the fortunes are very real.

04:21.540 --> 04:23.540
Really? Why?

04:23.580 --> 04:25.810
Because Zelzar is actually
from the wizard world.

04:25.850 --> 04:28.510
If a wizard requests a fortune from him,

04:28.550 --> 04:30.880
he's required to give them a real one.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.950
Aw! Now I want one even more.

04:33.990 --> 04:36.750
You really need to work
on your warning speeches.

04:36.790 --> 04:39.690
Listen, you might get a bad one and then,

04:39.730 --> 04:41.660
there's nothing you can do to stop it.

04:41.690 --> 04:43.530
Stay away from Zelzar.
Do you hear me?

04:43.560 --> 04:45.930
- Fine.
- OK, I got it.

04:45.970 --> 04:48.770
Well, for once a human can
do something a wizard can't.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.970
Yeah.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.570
Uh... Zelzar,

04:53.610 --> 04:55.910
one fake fortune for a human, please.

04:58.980 --> 05:00.910
Zelzar!

05:05.720 --> 05:07.720
"You are admired by many."

05:09.690 --> 05:11.560
Oh, I don't get it.
This one's true.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.630
Isn't it?

05:24.900 --> 05:27.540
Attention, Boogie boarders!

05:27.570 --> 05:29.540
You are in a rip tide!

05:29.580 --> 05:33.910
Swim parallel!
It's your only chance!

05:33.950 --> 05:35.980
Shut up, old lady!

05:37.950 --> 05:39.980
Mom, you were wrong.
This hat does not look cool.

05:46.630 --> 05:48.890
Harper, yeah, I'd like
to put the barbecue there

05:48.930 --> 05:50.860
so the smoke doesn't blow back on us.

05:50.900 --> 05:53.570
Oh, OK, I'll move. I just need
a comfy spot to read my book.

06:01.670 --> 06:04.010
Sorry, Harper, but I need
that spot for my umbrella.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.610
I'm gonna tan just my legs.

06:06.650 --> 06:08.850
OK, I'll just find another comfy spot.

07:01.870 --> 07:04.840
- Zelzar!
- Max, what are you doing?

07:04.870 --> 07:06.740
Dad told us not to get a fortune.

07:06.770 --> 07:09.640
Come on, Justin, he's just worried
about us getting bad fortunes.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.780
This one's gonna be
a good one. Watch.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.780
"You will receive
a sweet surprise."

07:15.810 --> 07:18.580
Oh, that does sound like a good one.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.820
Free ice cream?
Thank you!

07:22.860 --> 07:25.520
And it's called
"Sweet Surprise."

07:27.890 --> 07:30.500
These fortunes are
extremely well-detailed.

07:30.530 --> 07:32.530
Yeah, you should get a fortune.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.670
No, no, no, just because you got a good one
doesn't mean I'll get a good one, too.

07:35.700 --> 07:36.830
OK, suit yourself.

07:36.870 --> 07:39.870
I mean, I'd like to get a
fortune, but Dad warned us.

07:39.910 --> 07:43.680
But then again, you did get a good one,
and I'd probably get a good one, too.

07:43.710 --> 07:45.580
Probably.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.550
OK, fine, stop hounding me.
I'm doing it.

07:51.980 --> 07:53.790
Zelzar!

07:57.760 --> 08:00.830
"You will attract
the attention of a stranger."

08:01.830 --> 08:03.860
Hey, stranger.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.560
Did you see that?
She gave me the flirty fingers!

08:07.970 --> 08:10.800
- This is awesome!
- I know.

08:10.840 --> 08:13.540
What are the odds of you
meeting a girl named Stranger?

08:32.690 --> 08:33.890
OK...

08:51.980 --> 08:55.580
Harper, honey, stop playing
with the smoke. It's dangerous.

08:57.950 --> 09:01.520
Oh, the fire's going out.
Harper, give me some pages from your book.

09:01.550 --> 09:02.720
I'm still reading this.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.920
I'm talking about
the pages you already read.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.660
I haven't read anything yet!

09:08.690 --> 09:11.730
All right, that's it. I'm gonna go
read somewhere else. Come on, Alex.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.870
OK. Oh, hey, don't
bring that book, though.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.600
People will think we're nerds.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.780
Alex! The Zelzar
machine really works.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.520
Max and I got great fortunes.

09:31.550 --> 09:32.920
Yeah. It told me I was
gonna get a sweet surprise,

09:32.950 --> 09:34.690
and I got a free ice cream bar.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.760
Oh my gosh! That's
a totally lame coincidence!

09:39.830 --> 09:42.790
Yeah, but my fortune said I would
attract the attention of a stranger,

09:42.830 --> 09:45.660
and this really pretty girl waved at me.
And I even got her number.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.800
That machine didn't give you a
fortune, it gave you a miracle.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.940
- Alex, you gotta try it.
- All right, give me a quarter.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.910
No, your dad said wizards shouldn't use it.

09:54.940 --> 09:58.680
Yeah, and if he knew it could lead to
free ice cream, he'd change his tune.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.610
All right, Alex, now whatever
good stuff you get,

10:01.650 --> 10:03.680
you have to share with us
because we got you to do it.

10:06.650 --> 10:08.520
Zelzar!

10:12.230 --> 10:14.630
"Say goodbye to your life."

10:17.320 --> 10:19.180
You don't have to share that one with us.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.470
"Say goodbye to your life."

10:31.510 --> 10:34.170
This is not good.
This is really not good.

10:34.210 --> 10:37.180
Now, wait a minute.
Let's not jump to conclusions.

10:37.210 --> 10:39.610
"Say goodbye to your life"
could mean a lot of things.

10:39.650 --> 10:41.280
It could mean...

10:42.350 --> 10:43.680
...your life is ending.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.690
Or your days are numbered.

10:49.290 --> 10:51.360
You're definitely not
getting a sweet surprise.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.460
Sorry, Alex. There's
just no way to spin this

10:55.500 --> 10:57.460
in a positive manner.
What are we gonna do?

10:57.500 --> 11:00.470
Look, I'll handle it like
I handle all of life's problems.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.300
Ignore it until it goes away.

11:02.340 --> 11:04.540
OK? Now, let's get back
to our day on the beach.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.280
Well, that's a little hard to ignore.

11:15.350 --> 11:17.520
Please, Zelzar. We know
you're from the wizard world.

11:17.550 --> 11:19.250
You have to take back my fortune.

11:20.420 --> 11:22.590
I don't think he's gonna talk to us.

11:23.490 --> 11:25.490
Here, let me try.

11:27.390 --> 11:30.400
Hey, hey! Stop that.

11:34.230 --> 11:35.470
Look, young lady wizard,

11:35.500 --> 11:37.440
I'm sorry you got
a fortune you didn't like,

11:37.470 --> 11:40.240
but you know the deal, so, move along.

11:40.270 --> 11:43.140
There are some tour buses
coming through, and...

11:43.180 --> 11:45.580
...I love out-of-town quarters.

11:47.510 --> 11:50.550
OK, I made a mistake. I know
you're just doing your job,

11:50.580 --> 11:53.520
but I can't say goodbye to my life
forever like the fortune says,

11:53.550 --> 11:55.290
I'm only 17!

11:59.260 --> 12:00.530
"Boo hoo."

12:02.300 --> 12:04.260
Alex, we'd better tell your dad.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.530
No, no, Zelzar just
needs a little convincing.

12:06.570 --> 12:08.170
Max, show him the sword.

12:10.370 --> 12:14.270
Hey, Zelzar, I got
a sweet surprise for you.

12:14.310 --> 12:17.280
Alex, Max, you can't scare
a fortune-telling wizard.

12:17.310 --> 12:19.310
No?

12:19.350 --> 12:20.510
All right, all right, I'll help you!

12:22.350 --> 12:23.580
Scaredy-cat.

12:25.390 --> 12:27.250
Take back my fortune.

12:28.590 --> 12:32.430
I'm not supposed to, but maybe
we could work something out.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.460
You see, for years I've been
watching people come to the beach,

12:35.500 --> 12:38.560
laugh, eat all sorts of
delicious fried goodies,

12:38.600 --> 12:41.430
meet girls...

12:43.140 --> 12:45.470
...while I sit in this box.

12:46.540 --> 12:48.470
If you let me have some fun on the beach...

12:49.580 --> 12:51.410
...I'll take back your fortune.

12:53.650 --> 12:56.450
Well, I hope sitting quietly
on the beach and reading a book

12:56.480 --> 12:59.490
isn't on your list,
'cause that's not gonna happen.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.520
OK, you've got a deal.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.490
Why don't you grab your sun block
and loosen up your genie pants,

13:06.530 --> 13:08.360
because you're about to have
the best day of your life.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.400
One tiny problem.

13:10.430 --> 13:14.330
- I'm not allowed to leave this
machine unattended. - No problem.

13:14.370 --> 13:17.100
One of my brothers will take your place
in the machine while we're gone.

13:17.140 --> 13:19.510
Well, it's not gonna be me,
because I get claustrophobic.

13:19.540 --> 13:23.240
It's actuall..
Quite roomy in here.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.450
I'll do it. I love roomy
claustrophobic places.

13:27.380 --> 13:29.520
All right. Hello, beach.

13:29.550 --> 13:32.520
Here comes Zelzar!

13:32.550 --> 13:35.490
Vise versa.
Max and Zelzar Reverse-a.

13:40.330 --> 13:44.400
Oh, yeah!
Feels good to stretch my legs!

13:44.430 --> 13:46.500
Check it out! I have legs!

13:48.500 --> 13:51.470
Sweet! I have
a mustache and a beard!

13:51.510 --> 13:54.310
And they're itchy, just like
I always dreamed they would be!

13:56.240 --> 13:58.440
Uh, I better stay here with Max.

13:58.480 --> 14:02.550
I have a feeling his fortunes might
come out a little... Max-ish.

14:04.280 --> 14:08.320
This is so exciting. I...
I don't know what to do first.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.360
Watch out!

14:15.200 --> 14:17.530
Oh my gosh, Alex. That giant
mallet almost took your head off.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.130
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, for now.

14:20.170 --> 14:22.440
Let's just give this guy
a couple hours on the beach,

14:22.470 --> 14:24.100
so that he can take back my fortune.

14:24.140 --> 14:25.540
OK, Zelzar, what do you want to do first?

14:25.570 --> 14:31.410
Use one of these disposable cameras,
so that I can remember all of this!

15:00.410 --> 15:02.310
Maxar!

15:02.340 --> 15:04.540
Uh, excuse me, sir.
One second.

15:04.580 --> 15:09.520
I'm the fortune teller machine quality control...
inspector guy.

15:09.550 --> 15:11.450
Uh, I have to ask you to stand right there.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.160
"Mustache and beard. Jealous?"

15:20.460 --> 15:24.230
This is actually why I've been
inspecting these machines.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.360
Vague fortunes.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.070
What Zelzar is actually trying to say,

15:28.100 --> 15:33.310
is that "Jealousy is
a very hairy subject."

15:33.340 --> 15:36.380
So yeah, why don't you go take
b walk and think about that.

15:46.190 --> 15:47.520
"Ouch."

15:51.220 --> 15:55.330
Guys, the beach is so much fun!

15:56.600 --> 15:58.560
Yeah, maybe for you.
She's almost been taken out

15:58.600 --> 16:01.130
by a mallet, a corn dog, and a seagull.

16:01.170 --> 16:04.240
Yeah, and if we didn't have all those
pictures, no one would believe it.

16:04.270 --> 16:07.210
OK, Zelzar, you've had
a great time at the beach.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.210
Let's take back my bad fortune.

16:10.340 --> 16:12.110
Not so fast.

16:12.150 --> 16:15.250
I haven't talked to any beach beauties yet.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.420
What? No. You're not...

16:19.120 --> 16:22.220
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you, Harper.

16:22.260 --> 16:24.220
- That was close.
- A little too close.

16:24.260 --> 16:27.130
One of these near misses
is not going to be a near miss.

16:28.130 --> 16:29.500
Great, where did Zelzar go?

16:29.530 --> 16:32.370
Let's just spread out and find him.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.370
Nice try, Harper.
You're sticking with me.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.480
Maxar!

16:48.350 --> 16:50.280
Sir, excuse me!
I'm with the machine.

16:54.290 --> 16:56.290
"How do you like my mustache?"

16:57.320 --> 16:59.190
It's quite comical, actually.

16:59.230 --> 17:00.490
What he's trying to say is that...

17:00.530 --> 17:02.400
Maxar!

17:04.530 --> 17:07.069
"My mustache can beat up
your mustache."

17:08.339 --> 17:11.170
Don't know why I keep
reading these out loud.

17:12.369 --> 17:15.510
Well, sir, why don't
you enjoy. Move right along.

17:15.540 --> 17:19.410
There's a pack of seagulls!
There are several of them!

17:19.450 --> 17:22.250
What is your obsession with facial hair?

17:22.280 --> 17:26.150
When you become a man...
you'll know.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.060
First time at the beach?

17:38.100 --> 17:43.440
Whoo! It's my first time,
and I am enjoying the view.

17:43.470 --> 17:48.340
I'm... married.

17:50.510 --> 17:55.180
You must have seen my husband over there
barbecuing and thought he was my personal chef.

17:55.220 --> 17:56.580
I look a lot richer than I am.

17:59.220 --> 18:03.490
Great, we have to get him away from
her before my dad realizes who he is.

18:07.190 --> 18:10.130
Zelzar, OK, come on. You've
had your time at the beach

18:10.160 --> 18:14.100
and even flirted with a beach
beauty, who is my mom. So gross.

18:14.130 --> 18:16.100
It's time for you to take back my fortune.

18:16.140 --> 18:20.240
- Alex...
- You've gotta be kidding me!

18:20.270 --> 18:23.080
Come on Zelzar, it's time
to take back my fortune.

18:23.110 --> 18:26.180
Sorry!

18:27.250 --> 18:29.120
You want to tell your dad now?

18:30.320 --> 18:31.450
Daddy!

18:34.150 --> 18:37.320
I need your help. I got
a fortune from Zelzar,

18:37.360 --> 18:40.130
and he won't take it back
no matter what I do.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.060
I'm sorry, I should have listened to you.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.500
- Here's what the fortune says.
- "Say goodbye to your life."

18:45.530 --> 18:48.070
Oh, <i>mija.</i>

18:48.100 --> 18:51.370
Yeah, you might not want
to stand so close to her.

18:53.510 --> 18:56.380
Dad, Zelzar said that he
would take back my fortune

18:56.410 --> 18:59.380
if I gave him have a day at the
beach, but he keeps putting it off.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.320
Look, Zelzar.
My daughter's in danger.

19:04.350 --> 19:06.290
And it sounds like you made a promise.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.190
And you ate two of my burgers!

19:08.220 --> 19:11.120
'Cause they are delicious!

19:11.160 --> 19:13.290
Oh, thanks.

19:13.330 --> 19:16.460
The secret is the onion soup mix
is mixed into the meat...

19:16.500 --> 19:19.060
Daddy!

19:19.100 --> 19:21.430
Right! Zelzar,
take her fortune back.

19:21.470 --> 19:24.040
Yeah, about that...

19:24.070 --> 19:26.110
I'm having too much fun on the beach.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.170
I think I might wait a while before I...

19:29.510 --> 19:31.240
...get back in that box.

19:33.110 --> 19:35.250
But... that wasn't the deal!

19:39.090 --> 19:42.090
Everyone just needs
to calm down, OK? Calm down!

19:42.120 --> 19:45.220
There's no need to get upset
over a few silly fortunes.

19:45.260 --> 19:47.160
You call this a fortune?

19:47.190 --> 19:50.230
"Grow a beard
and join my beard club."

19:50.260 --> 19:54.330
- What does that even mean?
- Who knows?

19:54.370 --> 19:59.470
Look, if you want to destroy the thing,
fine, destroy it. I'm not gonna stop you.

20:01.340 --> 20:03.440
Those two are ruining
the fortune-telling business

20:03.480 --> 20:07.280
that I've built up over the last century.
I gotta get back in there.

20:07.310 --> 20:09.220
OK, I'll put you back in there,

20:09.250 --> 20:11.080
but you know what you promised to do.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.550
All right, all right.
I can't erase your fortune,

20:13.590 --> 20:17.490
but I can transfer it
to the next paying customer.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.160
I'm good with that. You?

20:21.190 --> 20:24.330
Yeah. I hope it's
that flying rat.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.470
All right, deal.
Get him back in the box.

20:27.500 --> 20:31.200
I can't do the spell,
there's too many people!

20:31.240 --> 20:33.070
Hey, look, everyone!

20:33.110 --> 20:36.210
That unattended barbecue just
set the lifeguard tower on fire!

20:36.240 --> 20:39.350
Good thinking, Harper.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.510
Actually, I'm not lying.
Your dad's grill tipped over.

20:41.550 --> 20:44.320
- My burgers!
- My book!

20:44.350 --> 20:46.390
My floppy hat!

20:51.120 --> 20:53.490
Wow, that was a blast!

20:55.560 --> 20:57.430
Wait, where's my beard and mustache?

20:59.230 --> 21:01.570
Here come the firemen.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.500
Guys, I'm married!

21:07.210 --> 21:10.140
You know what?
Let's just go home.

21:15.450 --> 21:17.450
Wait...

21:17.480 --> 21:20.520
Oh, no, that little girl's gonna get
my old fortune. This is horrible.

21:22.190 --> 21:23.490
Zelzar!

21:26.360 --> 21:28.490
Poor girl.

21:28.530 --> 21:30.330
Hang on there, little girl.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.500
I'm Hal Art, host of
<i>Random Prize Giveaway.</i>

21:33.530 --> 21:37.140
Say goodbye to your life, because
we're randomly giving you...

21:37.170 --> 21:39.100
...one million dollars!

21:40.210 --> 21:43.280
What? That's my money!
That's my money!

21:43.310 --> 21:46.190
That's my money!
It's mine!

21:49.740 --> 21:52.430
Ok here it comes .... Ahhh!

21:52.710 --> 21:56.740
- OK, my turn.
- Ohhh!

21:56.780 --> 21:58.540
Who needs air conditioning?

21:58.580 --> 22:01.380
Ah... my mustache would've
really enjoyed this.

22:01.410 --> 22:03.350
This is so much better
than a day at the beach.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.950
I'm gonna finish this book, no matter what.

22:10.070 --> 22:13.010
Oh... It's broke. It's broke. How do we fix it?

22:13.010 --> 22:14.770
Wait. I'll fix it. I'll fix it.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.320
Fix the fan, make it right.
Make it blow with all its might.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.720
Great. Thanks, Alex.

22:21.030 --> 22:22.910
- Ah! Oh!
- All right...

22:22.910 --> 22:24.180
- Whoa!
- Wait!

22:24.500 --> 22:27.200
Too much might!
Too much might!

22:27.200 --> 22:28.490
Turn it off!
