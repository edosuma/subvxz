Just pitching in, helping out.
Did I ever mention that I--?

41:14.151 --> 41:16.467
TOGETHER:
Have no life. Yeah.

41:16.567 --> 41:18.675
Paige has been great.
Quick study too.

41:18.775 --> 41:20.757
You should see all the folk
remedies the gypsies have.

41:20.857 --> 41:22.632
Some of them are even better
than Western medicine.

41:22.732 --> 41:26.046
Really? Any of them help
with my nauseousness?

41:26.146 --> 41:28.712
- Well, it's funny
you should ask.
- Where are you going?

41:28.812 --> 41:31.086
You don't want to be late
for your appointment, do you?

41:31.186 --> 41:33.750
- What appointment?
- Your appointment with Ava.

41:33.850 --> 41:35.059
Meet your new doctor.

41:36.849 --> 41:38.208
Oh.

41:38.308 --> 41:40.540
She's also gonna teach us
how to be your midwives.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.039
Midwives? No.

41:43.139 --> 41:45.746
See, because I'm not
having this thing naturally.

41:45.846 --> 41:47.828
No, I need lots and lots
of Western medicine.

41:47.928 --> 41:49.743
- Piper--
- No offense.

41:49.843 --> 41:53.741
Piper. You know, I trusted you
to carry on my heritage,

41:53.841 --> 41:56.367
now you trust me
to carry on yours.

41:56.467 --> 41:58.342
Yeah, right. You're good.
