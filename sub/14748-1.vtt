00:30.255 --> 00:31.756
Shh.

00:49.942 --> 00:53.319
Royal Tenenbaum
bought the house on Archer Avenue

00:53.403 --> 00:55.154
in the winter of his 35th year.

00:59.910 --> 01:01.369
Over the next decade

01:01.453 --> 01:03.955
he and his wife
had three children

01:04.039 --> 01:05.915
and then they separated.

01:10.087 --> 01:12.713
Are you
getting divorced?

01:12.798 --> 01:17.802
At the moment, no...
but... it doesn't look good.

01:17.886 --> 01:19.804
Do you still love us?

01:19.888 --> 01:21.138
Of course I do.

01:21.223 --> 01:22.682
Do you still love Mom?

01:22.766 --> 01:24.684
Yes, very much, but your
mother's asked me to leave

01:24.768 --> 01:26.394
and I must respect
her position on the matter.

01:26.478 --> 01:27.687
Is it our fault?

01:27.771 --> 01:29.939
No.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.191
Obviously,
we made certain sacrifices

01:32.276 --> 01:34.735
as a result of having children,
but, uh...

01:34.820 --> 01:35.778
no, Lord, no.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.989
Then why'd she ask you to leave?

01:38.073 --> 01:41.534
I don't really know anymore.

01:43.745 --> 01:47.331
Maybe, uh, I wasn't as true
to her as I could've been.

01:47.416 --> 01:48.082
Well, she said...

01:48.166 --> 01:49.166
Let's just drop it

01:49.251 --> 01:50.501
shall we, uh, Chassie?

01:50.586 --> 01:52.962
They were never legally divorced.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.213
Thank you, Pagoda.

01:54.298 --> 01:56.465
Etheline Tenenbaum kept the house

01:56.550 --> 01:57.675
and raised the children

01:57.759 --> 02:00.052
and their education was
her highest priority.

02:00.137 --> 02:02.680
Yes, I'll hold, please.

02:02.764 --> 02:04.265
Thank you.

02:04.349 --> 02:06.225
I need $187.

02:06.310 --> 02:08.227
Write yourself a check.

02:13.984 --> 02:15.860
Bene. Si.

02:15.944 --> 02:18.738
Grazie mille.

02:20.407 --> 02:23.117
She wrote a book on the subject.

02:26.455 --> 02:27.830
Chas, Chas!
Richie!

02:27.915 --> 02:30.041
Uh, the gentleman
in the blue cardigan, please.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.001
Thank you. I have
a two-part question.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.085
Go ahead.

02:35.464 --> 02:38.341
Chas Tenenbaum had,
since elementary school

02:38.425 --> 02:40.301
taken most of his meals
in his room

02:40.385 --> 02:42.762
standing up at his desk
with a cup of coffee

02:42.846 --> 02:44.931
to save time.

02:49.353 --> 02:51.938
In the sixth grade,
he went into business

02:52.022 --> 02:53.522
breeding Dalmatian mice

02:53.607 --> 02:56.567
which he sold to a pet shop
in Little Tokyo.

02:56.652 --> 02:59.570
He started buying real estate
in his early teens

02:59.655 --> 03:03.115
and seemed to have an almost
preternatural understanding

03:03.200 --> 03:05.117
of international finance.

03:05.202 --> 03:09.664
He negotiated the purchase
of his father's summer house

03:09.748 --> 03:11.666
on Eagle's Island.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.090
Hold it, Chassie.

03:19.174 --> 03:20.758
Hold it right there.

03:20.842 --> 03:22.927
What are you doing?
You're on my team.

03:24.012 --> 03:25.930
There are no teams.

03:30.686 --> 03:34.146
The BB was still
lodged between two knuckles

03:34.231 --> 03:36.607
in Chas's left hand.

03:36.692 --> 03:39.402
Margot Tenenbaum was adopted
at age two.

03:39.486 --> 03:43.114
Her father had always noted
this when introducing her.

03:43.198 --> 03:45.866
This is my adopted daughter
Margot Tenenbaum.

03:45.951 --> 03:50.663
She was a playwright,
and won a Braverman Grant of $50,000

03:50.747 --> 03:52.873
in the ninth grade.

03:57.379 --> 04:00.923
She and her brother Richie
ran away from home one winter

04:01.008 --> 04:02.591
and camped out

04:02.676 --> 04:05.970
in the African wing
of the public archives.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.224
Hi, Eli.

04:10.308 --> 04:12.143
You said I could run away, too.

04:12.227 --> 04:15.688
No, I didn't, and don't
tell anyone you saw us.

04:15.772 --> 04:17.648
They shared a sleeping bag

04:17.733 --> 04:19.817
and survived on crackers
and root beer.

04:19.901 --> 04:21.819
Four years later

04:21.903 --> 04:24.822
Margot disappeared alone
for two weeks

04:24.906 --> 04:28.159
and came back
with half a finger missing.

04:32.748 --> 04:35.916
Richie Tenenbaum had been
a champion tennis player

04:36.001 --> 04:37.501
since the third grade.

04:37.586 --> 04:39.670
Do you copy, Anonymous?

04:44.009 --> 04:45.926
He turned pro at 17

04:46.011 --> 04:49.221
and won the U.S. Nationals
three years in a row.

04:49.306 --> 04:53.059
He kept a studio
in the corner of the ballroom

04:53.143 --> 04:56.187
but had failed to develop
as a painter.

04:56.271 --> 04:59.440
Up... up...

04:59.524 --> 05:00.649
right...

05:00.734 --> 05:01.692
perfect.

05:01.777 --> 05:02.651
Pagoda?

05:02.736 --> 05:04.111
On weekends

05:04.196 --> 05:06.030
Royal took him on outings
around the city.

05:09.618 --> 05:11.452
Put it out there.

05:11.536 --> 05:12.787
These invitations

05:12.871 --> 05:14.538
were never extended
to anyone else.

05:18.627 --> 05:22.922
Richie's best friend, Eli Cash,
lived with his aunt

05:23.006 --> 05:25.883
in the building
across the street.

05:25.967 --> 05:28.719
He was a regular fixture
at family gatherings

05:28.804 --> 05:32.139
holidays, mornings before
school, and most afternoons.

05:35.644 --> 05:39.105
The three Tenenbaum children
performed Margot's first play

05:39.189 --> 05:41.232
on the night
of her 11th birthday.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.068
They had agreed

05:44.152 --> 05:48.239
to invite their father
to the party.

05:48.323 --> 05:49.740
What'd you think, Dad?

05:49.825 --> 05:52.409
Mmm... didn't seem
believable to me.

05:52.494 --> 05:53.786
Why are you wearing pajamas?

05:53.870 --> 05:54.954
Do you live here?

05:55.038 --> 05:57.164
He has permission to sleep over.

05:57.249 --> 05:58.874
Well, did you at least think

05:58.959 --> 06:01.085
the characters
were well-developed?

06:01.169 --> 06:02.086
What characters?

06:02.170 --> 06:03.921
This is a bunch
of little kids, uh

06:04.005 --> 06:05.422
dressed up in animal costumes.

06:05.507 --> 06:07.258
Good night, everyone.

06:07.342 --> 06:08.759
Well, sweetie...

06:08.844 --> 06:09.677
don't be mad at me.

06:09.761 --> 06:11.428
That's just one man's opinion.

06:14.599 --> 06:18.060
# Happy birthday to you #

06:18.145 --> 06:21.397
# Happy birthday to you... #

06:21.481 --> 06:25.609
He had not been
invited to any of their parties since.

06:25.694 --> 06:28.154
In fact, virtually all memory

06:28.238 --> 06:30.656
of the brilliance
of the young Tenenbaums

06:30.740 --> 06:31.991
had been erased

06:32.075 --> 06:36.662
by two decades of betrayal,
failure, and disaster.

06:36.746 --> 06:37.663
Go, Mordecai.

06:39.457 --> 06:42.418
# Na, na, na #

06:42.502 --> 06:48.090
# Na-na-na-na #

06:48.175 --> 06:52.094
# Hey, Jude #

06:52.179 --> 06:55.222
# Na, na, na #

06:55.307 --> 06:56.640
# Na-na-na-na... #

08:10.799 --> 08:11.799
I've been instructed

08:11.883 --> 08:14.551
to refuse any further charges
on your room account

08:14.636 --> 08:16.220
and to direct you, in writing

08:16.304 --> 08:19.265
to please vacate the premises
by the end of the month.

08:19.349 --> 08:22.226
What about Sing-Sang?

08:22.310 --> 08:25.062
I owe her $100.

08:25.146 --> 08:28.857
Royal had lived
in the Lindbergh Palace Hotel

08:28.942 --> 08:30.609
for 22 years.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.990
Can you pay her in cash?

08:36.073 --> 08:37.825
Uh-uh.

08:37.909 --> 08:41.870
He was a prominent
litigator until the mid '80s

08:41.955 --> 08:45.165
when he was disbarred
and briefly imprisoned.

08:45.250 --> 08:51.672
No one in his family had spoken
to him in three years.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.842
Read it back to me so far,
Pietro.

09:02.976 --> 09:03.851
New paragraph.

09:03.935 --> 09:05.394
Richie had retired

09:05.478 --> 09:07.104
from professional tennis at 26.

09:07.188 --> 09:10.107
His last match had been
widely discussed in the media.

09:14.195 --> 09:16.697
"Your friend Richie."
End of letter.

09:16.781 --> 09:19.533
For the past year,
he had been traveling alone

09:19.617 --> 09:21.744
on an ocean liner
called the Cote d'Ivoire

09:21.828 --> 09:24.371
and had seen both poles,
five oceans

09:24.456 --> 09:26.290
the Amazon and the Nile.

09:26.374 --> 09:28.876
"The crickets
and the rust beetles scuttled

09:28.960 --> 09:31.295
"among the nettles
of the sage thicket.

09:31.379 --> 09:33.464
"'Vamanos, amigos,'
he whispered

09:33.548 --> 09:35.966
"and threw
the busted-leather flint craw

09:36.051 --> 09:38.469
"over the loose weave
of the saddle cock

09:38.553 --> 09:41.430
and they rode on
in the friscalating dusk light."

09:43.183 --> 09:45.351
Eli was an assistant professor

09:45.435 --> 09:47.478
of English literature
at Brooks College.

09:47.562 --> 09:50.022
The recent publication
of his second novel...

09:54.110 --> 09:57.654
...had earned him a sudden,
unexpected literary celebrity.

09:57.739 --> 10:01.408
Well, everyone knows Custer
died at Little Bighorn.

10:01.493 --> 10:05.037
What this book presupposes is...
maybe he didn't.

10:05.121 --> 10:06.288
Let me ask you something.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.415
Why would a review
make the point of saying

10:08.500 --> 10:09.583
someone's not a genius?

10:09.667 --> 10:12.836
You think I'm especially
not a genius?

10:12.921 --> 10:15.422
I know w...

10:15.507 --> 10:17.925
You didn't even have
to think about it, did you?

10:18.009 --> 10:21.428
Well, I just don't use
that word lightly.

10:24.349 --> 10:27.226
I have to go, Eli.

10:29.687 --> 10:30.687
Margot?

10:30.772 --> 10:31.688
Uh-huh.

10:31.773 --> 10:34.108
May I come in, please?

10:47.997 --> 10:49.456
How are you, my darling?

10:49.541 --> 10:53.252
Margo was married
to the writer and neurologist

10:53.336 --> 10:55.629
Raleigh St. Clair.

10:57.799 --> 11:00.551
I'm fine, thank you.

11:00.635 --> 11:02.052
You need to eat something.

11:02.137 --> 11:03.554
May I make you dinner?

11:03.638 --> 11:04.471
No, thank you.

11:14.190 --> 11:16.984
She was known for her extreme secrecy.

11:17.068 --> 11:19.361
For example,
none of the Tenenbaums knew

11:19.446 --> 11:22.739
she was a smoker, which she
had been since the age of 12.

11:22.824 --> 11:25.242
Nor were they aware
of her first marriage

11:25.326 --> 11:27.995
and divorce to
a recording artist in Jamaica.

11:28.079 --> 11:31.665
She kept a private studio
in Mockingbird Heights

11:31.749 --> 11:34.418
under the name "Helen Scott."

11:34.502 --> 11:38.172
She had not completed a play
in seven years.

11:38.256 --> 11:44.678
17 October, third examination
of Dudley Heinsbergen.

11:44.762 --> 11:47.681
All right, Dudley

11:47.765 --> 11:50.184
make yours like mine.

11:51.853 --> 11:54.771
Raleigh's next book was on the subject

11:54.856 --> 11:57.983
of a condition he called
"Heinsbergen Syndrome."

11:59.444 --> 12:01.487
Where's that red one

12:01.571 --> 12:03.489
going to go?

12:05.867 --> 12:07.451
Done.

12:09.871 --> 12:11.872
Good.

12:11.956 --> 12:13.957
Very good.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.628
My goodness.

12:17.712 --> 12:20.506
How interesting. How bizarre.

12:20.590 --> 12:23.383
Dudley suffers
from a rare disorder

12:23.468 --> 12:26.053
combining symptoms
of amnesia, dyslexia

12:26.137 --> 12:28.055
and color blindness.

12:28.139 --> 12:30.516
He has a highly acute
sense of hearing.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.059
There is also evidence of...

12:32.143 --> 12:33.644
I'm not color blind, am I?

12:33.728 --> 12:36.980
I'm afraid you are.

12:52.664 --> 12:56.500
Ari, fire alarm! Let's go!

12:56.584 --> 12:57.918
Out you go!

12:58.002 --> 12:59.419
Let's go!

13:03.341 --> 13:05.425
Uzi, emergency! Let's go!

13:08.763 --> 13:11.848
Uzi... what did I just say?!

13:11.933 --> 13:13.016
Look alive!

13:13.101 --> 13:14.184
Fire!

13:14.269 --> 13:15.602
Chas's wife Rachael

13:15.687 --> 13:18.105
was killed in a plane crash
the previous summer.

13:18.189 --> 13:19.106
What about Buckley?

13:19.190 --> 13:20.607
It's too late. You forgot him.

13:20.692 --> 13:22.192
Buckley! Buckley!

13:25.613 --> 13:27.698
No elevator! There's a fire.

13:27.782 --> 13:28.949
Go, go!

13:29.033 --> 13:31.285
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

13:31.369 --> 13:34.997
Chas and their two sons,
Ari and Uzi

13:35.081 --> 13:38.125
were also on the flight
and survived

13:38.209 --> 13:40.460
as did their dog

13:40.545 --> 13:41.920
who was discovered in his cage

13:42.005 --> 13:44.715
several thousand yards
from the crash site.

13:53.474 --> 13:55.225
Four minutes, 48 seconds.

13:55.310 --> 13:57.561
We're all dead,
burnt to a crisp.

13:57.645 --> 13:59.229
Over the last six months

13:59.314 --> 14:01.982
he had become increasingly
concerned with their safety.

14:02.066 --> 14:03.984
We left Buckley.

14:04.068 --> 14:06.153
It doesn't matter.

14:12.243 --> 14:14.578
Etheline became an archaeologist

14:14.662 --> 14:16.246
and had overseen excavations

14:16.331 --> 14:19.166
for the Department of Housing
and the Transit Authority.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.168
Apropos of my question

14:21.252 --> 14:26.089
regarding I-40
slash I-9 adjustments...

14:26.174 --> 14:27.090
um...

14:28.509 --> 14:31.011
She taught a bridge class twice a week

14:31.095 --> 14:33.805
with her friend and business
manager, Henry Sherman.

14:37.894 --> 14:40.103
It would probably be
advantageous

14:40.188 --> 14:42.105
for your marital status

14:42.190 --> 14:44.691
to be legally established
as single

14:44.776 --> 14:46.109
in light of the circumstances.

14:46.194 --> 14:47.361
What do you mean?

14:47.445 --> 14:49.363
I mean for tax purposes.

14:49.447 --> 14:50.364
But I thought...

14:50.448 --> 14:52.282
- Etheline...
- Yes?

14:52.367 --> 14:53.992
Will you marry me?

14:55.953 --> 14:57.162
I...

14:57.246 --> 14:58.538
I love you, uh...

14:58.623 --> 15:00.624
Did you already know that?

15:00.708 --> 15:03.293
No, I didn't.

15:03.378 --> 15:05.545
Since her separation
from her husband

15:05.630 --> 15:07.339
she had had many suitors...

15:13.388 --> 15:17.474
...but had not considered
a single one until this moment.

15:17.558 --> 15:21.061
This isn't really
a tax issue, is it?

15:21.145 --> 15:24.231
That's true, uh...

15:24.315 --> 15:27.234
I don't know why
I put it that way.

15:29.487 --> 15:32.030
Let me think about it, Henry.

15:35.618 --> 15:39.162
Hello. Please tell Mr. Royal
this is the Pagoda.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.669
Lobby.

15:45.753 --> 15:47.921
Thank you, Dusty.

15:48.005 --> 15:49.673
You're welcome.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.093
Good morning, Jerry.

15:53.177 --> 15:54.428
Hmm...

15:54.512 --> 15:58.432
Oh, there's a call for you,
Mr. Tenenbaum.

15:58.516 --> 15:59.766
Who is it, Frederick?

15:59.851 --> 16:01.685
A Mr. Pagoda.

16:06.107 --> 16:07.524
What do you got?

16:07.608 --> 16:10.527
The black man asked her
to be his wife.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.448
No shit?

16:14.532 --> 16:16.241
What did Ethel say?

16:16.325 --> 16:18.744
She think about it.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.707
I don't like the sound of this
one damn bit, Pagoda.

16:23.791 --> 16:26.710
I mean... Lord knows

16:26.794 --> 16:30.505
I've had my share
of infidelities

16:30.590 --> 16:32.966
but she's still my wife.

16:35.136 --> 16:37.721
And no damn two-bit,
chartered accountant

16:37.805 --> 16:40.223
is going to change that.

16:48.316 --> 16:50.150
Hi.

16:53.362 --> 16:58.074
Hey, Pagoda,
give us a hand, huh?

17:11.422 --> 17:13.507
Chas?

17:15.843 --> 17:16.968
What's going on?

17:17.053 --> 17:18.595
We got locked out
of our apartment.

17:18.679 --> 17:20.931
Did you call a locksmith?

17:21.015 --> 17:23.098
Uh-huh.

17:23.184 --> 17:24.434
Well, I don't understand.

17:24.519 --> 17:26.853
Did you pack your bags
before you got locked out

17:26.938 --> 17:28.104
or how did you?

17:28.189 --> 17:30.607
It's not safe over there.

17:30.691 --> 17:33.777
Excuse me for a moment.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.781
What are you talking about?

17:37.865 --> 17:38.782
The apartment.

17:38.866 --> 17:40.700
I have to get
some new sprinklers

17:40.785 --> 17:43.036
and a backup
security system installed.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.206
But there are
no sprinklers here, either.

17:46.290 --> 17:49.376
Well, we might have
to do something about that, too.

17:52.797 --> 17:55.465
Okay.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.592
Isn't this fun, huh?

17:57.677 --> 17:58.802
Isn't this great?

17:58.886 --> 18:00.637
Feels like we're camping.

18:00.721 --> 18:02.514
When are we going home?

18:02.598 --> 18:03.473
Huh?

18:03.558 --> 18:04.474
Hey, look at this.

18:05.893 --> 18:07.978
Pretty cool, huh?

18:08.062 --> 18:10.063
# Who am I supposed to be? #

18:10.147 --> 18:11.356
Who put that in here?

18:11.440 --> 18:14.234
#... Look at me #

18:17.572 --> 18:19.155
# What am I supposed to be? #

18:19.240 --> 18:20.740
Okay.

18:20.825 --> 18:23.618
Well, I will see you boys
in the morning.

18:23.703 --> 18:24.828
- Good night.
- Good night.

18:24.912 --> 18:25.996
Good night.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.998
# Look at me #

18:28.082 --> 18:29.332
You know what?

18:29.417 --> 18:32.002
I think I'm going
to sleep in here with you.

18:32.086 --> 18:33.253
That way...

18:35.381 --> 18:37.674
...we can all be together.

18:38.926 --> 18:41.845
# Oh, my love #

18:41.929 --> 18:44.598
# Oh. #

18:53.691 --> 18:55.567
What kind of side effects
can be expected?

18:55.651 --> 18:57.527
Well, there are
a number of possibilities.

18:57.612 --> 18:59.529
Severe nausea and dizziness
are standard.

18:59.614 --> 19:02.365
A certain percentage of patients
may also experience seizure.

19:02.450 --> 19:05.285
You mean, like flopping around
on the floor and everything?

19:05.369 --> 19:07.162
In some cases.

19:09.624 --> 19:13.501
You have a visitor, my darling.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.545
Who is it?

19:15.630 --> 19:19.090
It's me, sweetie.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.729
Raleigh says you've been
spending six hours a day

19:32.813 --> 19:34.731
locked in here,
watching television

19:34.815 --> 19:36.107
and soaking in the tub.

19:36.192 --> 19:38.777
I doubt that.

19:38.861 --> 19:40.862
I don't think that's
very healthy, do you?

19:40.947 --> 19:42.656
Nor do I think
it's very intelligent

19:42.740 --> 19:45.450
to keep an electrical gadget
on the edge of the bathtub.

19:45.534 --> 19:47.327
I tie it to the radiator.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.666
Well, it can't be very good
for your eyes, anyway.

20:02.218 --> 20:04.970
Chas came home.

20:05.054 --> 20:07.389
What do you mean?

20:07.473 --> 20:09.766
He and Ari and Uzi
are going to stay

20:09.850 --> 20:12.102
with me for a little while.

20:12.186 --> 20:15.772
Why are they allowed
to do that?

20:15.856 --> 20:17.482
I don't know exactly

20:17.566 --> 20:20.360
but I think he's been
very depressed.

20:20.444 --> 20:21.987
So am I.

20:22.071 --> 20:24.447
So are you, what?

20:24.532 --> 20:26.449
But why is this necessary?

20:26.534 --> 20:29.703
'Cause I'm in a rut,
and I need a change.

20:29.787 --> 20:31.913
Hang on.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.790
(Vince Guaraldi Trio's

20:33.874 --> 20:36.292
"Christmas Time is Here"
playing)

20:36.377 --> 20:37.752
Taxi!

20:42.675 --> 20:44.759
That cab has a dent in it.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.473
You don't love me
anymore, do you?

20:50.558 --> 20:52.642
I do, kind of.

20:52.727 --> 20:54.561
I can't explain it right now.

20:54.645 --> 20:57.772
Another dent here,
and another dent here.

21:06.073 --> 21:08.825
I'll call you, okay?

21:29.263 --> 21:31.681
Hello.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.018
Hello?

21:37.271 --> 21:39.939
Hello, beautiful.

21:50.618 --> 21:51.743
Got a minute?

21:53.204 --> 21:55.038
What are you doing here?

21:55.122 --> 21:56.372
Uh, I need a favor.

21:56.457 --> 21:59.042
I want to spend some time
with you and the children.

21:59.126 --> 22:01.044
Are you crazy?

22:01.128 --> 22:02.253
Well, wait a minute, damn it!

22:02.338 --> 22:03.421
Stop following me.

22:03.506 --> 22:04.714
Well, I want my family back.

22:04.799 --> 22:06.257
Well, you can't have it.

22:06.342 --> 22:09.344
I'm sorry for you,
but it's too late.

22:09.428 --> 22:10.720
Well, listen...

22:10.805 --> 22:12.889
Baby, I'm dying.

22:14.517 --> 22:17.727
Yeah, I'm-I'm sick as a dog.

22:17.812 --> 22:20.814
I'll be dead in six weeks.

22:20.898 --> 22:23.233
I'm dying.

22:29.990 --> 22:31.991
What are you talking about?

22:37.998 --> 22:40.166
What's happening?

22:44.797 --> 22:47.132
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.510
I didn't know.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.725
Well, what'd they say?

22:57.810 --> 22:59.769
What is the prognosis?

22:59.854 --> 23:01.479
Take it easy, Ethel.

23:01.564 --> 23:03.773
Now, hold-hold on, baby,
hold on.

23:03.858 --> 23:06.776
Hold on, okay?

23:09.405 --> 23:11.573
Ethel, hold on, hold on.

23:11.657 --> 23:12.866
Where is the doctor?

23:12.950 --> 23:14.159
Don't... Well, just...

23:14.243 --> 23:15.451
W- Wait a second now.

23:15.536 --> 23:16.786
Wait a second.

23:16.871 --> 23:21.374
Okay, uh, listen,
I'm not dying...

23:21.458 --> 23:23.126
but I need some time.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.378
A month or so, okay?

23:25.462 --> 23:28.173
I want us...
I want us to-to...

23:28.257 --> 23:30.175
What's wrong with you?!

23:30.259 --> 23:31.676
Damn!

23:31.760 --> 23:32.760
Ethel.

23:32.845 --> 23:33.761
Are you crazy?!

23:33.846 --> 23:35.305
Ethel, baby...

23:35.389 --> 23:38.558
I am dying.

23:49.570 --> 23:52.071
Are you or aren't you?

23:52.156 --> 23:55.783
What? Dying?

23:55.868 --> 23:58.036
Yeah.

24:00.915 --> 24:02.415
Have you told your children?

24:02.499 --> 24:03.917
More or less.

24:04.001 --> 24:05.710
And are they all right?

24:05.794 --> 24:07.337
It's hard to say.

24:07.421 --> 24:08.713
Who's your father?

24:08.797 --> 24:10.590
His name is Royal Tenenbaum.

24:10.674 --> 24:12.342
You told us he was already dead.

24:12.426 --> 24:14.302
Yeah, well, now
he's really dying.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.220
- Ready.
- Print it.

24:15.304 --> 24:16.721
I am very sorry, Margo.

24:16.805 --> 24:17.764
That's okay.

24:17.848 --> 24:19.766
We're not actually related,
anyway.

24:20.809 --> 24:21.851
True.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.979
I'd like to send a response,
please.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.648
Yes, sir, go ahead.

24:27.524 --> 24:28.399
Dear Mom:

24:28.484 --> 24:30.151
I received your message.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.654
I'm coming home
as soon as possible.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.364
Who do I see about that?

24:34.448 --> 24:38.368
The ship's porter arranged
for Richie to disembark at Halifax

24:38.452 --> 24:40.578
and transfer
to a third-class state room

24:40.663 --> 24:42.080
on board the Queen Helena

24:42.164 --> 24:44.123
destined for
the Eastern seaboard.

24:44.208 --> 24:48.044
His trunks would not arrive
for another 11 days.

24:48.128 --> 24:50.004
Hey, Baumer.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.923
Do you mind if we get
a picture with you?

24:52.007 --> 24:53.299
Not at all.

24:55.302 --> 24:58.346
He had made a request for his usual escort

24:58.430 --> 25:00.556
the one from his days
on the circuit

25:00.641 --> 25:03.893
to meet him at the pier
by way of the Green Line bus.

25:03.978 --> 25:05.395
Hi.

25:07.481 --> 25:10.733
As always, she was late.

25:42.683 --> 25:46.936
# I've been out walking #

25:47.021 --> 25:53.776
# I don't do too much talking
these days #

25:53.861 --> 25:58.573
# These days #

25:58.657 --> 26:01.284
# These days I seem
to think a lot #

26:01.368 --> 26:06.164
# About the things
that I forgot to do... #

26:08.250 --> 26:11.794
# And other times, I... #

26:11.879 --> 26:13.629
Stand up straight.

26:13.714 --> 26:16.174
Let me get a look at you.

26:19.386 --> 26:21.721
What's so funny?

26:23.974 --> 26:27.226
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

26:36.403 --> 26:39.280
That night,
Etheline found all of her children

26:39.365 --> 26:41.157
living together under
the same roof

26:41.241 --> 26:42.825
for the first time in 17 years.

26:42.910 --> 26:44.243
Where's your dad?

26:51.627 --> 26:54.670
The next morning,
Richie woke at dawn.

26:54.755 --> 26:58.174
He had decided birds should not
be kept in cages

26:58.258 --> 27:01.886
fed Mordecai three sardines,
and set him free.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.928
I've missed the hell out of you,
my darlings.

27:44.012 --> 27:46.389
Well, you know that, though,
don't you?

27:47.641 --> 27:49.225
I hear you're dying.

27:49.309 --> 27:51.436
So they tell me.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.979
I'm sorry.

27:53.063 --> 27:55.398
Well, I've had a good run.

27:55.482 --> 27:57.608
You don't look so sick, Dad.

27:57.693 --> 27:59.360
Thank you.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.945
What have you got?

28:01.029 --> 28:02.905
I've got a pretty bad case
of cancer.

28:02.990 --> 28:05.283
How long you going to last?

28:05.367 --> 28:07.577
Not long.

28:07.661 --> 28:09.412
A month, a year?

28:09.496 --> 28:11.581
About six weeks.

28:11.665 --> 28:12.790
Let me get to the point.

28:12.875 --> 28:15.293
The three of you and your mother
are all I've got

28:15.377 --> 28:17.003
and I love you
more than anything.

28:17.087 --> 28:18.087
Ho-ho!

28:18.172 --> 28:19.505
- Ho-ho.
- Chas, let me

28:19.590 --> 28:21.507
finish here.

28:21.592 --> 28:25.344
Now, I've got six weeks
to set things right with you

28:25.429 --> 28:26.762
and I aim to do it.

28:26.847 --> 28:28.764
Will you give me a chance?

28:28.849 --> 28:29.807
No.

28:29.892 --> 28:30.683
You speak

28:30.767 --> 28:31.767
for everyone?

28:31.852 --> 28:33.144
I speak for myself.

28:33.228 --> 28:34.937
Well, you've
made your views known.

28:35.022 --> 28:37.273
Let somebody else do some of
the talking now.

28:37.357 --> 28:39.442
What do you propose to do?

28:39.526 --> 28:41.360
I can't say, really.

28:41.445 --> 28:44.947
Um, make up for lost time,
I suppose.

28:45.032 --> 28:46.449
First thing I want to do is

28:46.533 --> 28:49.285
take you out to see
your grandmother, at some point.

28:49.369 --> 28:52.038
I haven't been out there
since I was six.

28:52.122 --> 28:53.915
I haven't been out there at all.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.124
I was never invited.

28:55.209 --> 28:57.793
Well, she wasn't
your real grandmother

28:57.878 --> 29:01.714
and I never knew how much
interest you had, uh, sweetie.

29:01.798 --> 29:03.633
Anyway, you're invited now.

29:03.717 --> 29:04.800
Thanks.

29:04.885 --> 29:06.802
You know, Rachael's buried

29:06.887 --> 29:07.845
out there, too.

29:07.930 --> 29:09.180
Who?

29:09.264 --> 29:11.057
My wife.

29:11.141 --> 29:12.350
Oh, that's right, isn't it?

29:12.434 --> 29:14.644
Well, we'll have to swing
by her grave, too.

29:20.901 --> 29:23.069
Uh, I'll be right back.

29:23.153 --> 29:27.406
Chas.

29:29.117 --> 29:31.244
Can I see my grandsons?

29:31.328 --> 29:32.828
Why?

29:32.913 --> 29:36.040
Because I finally want
to meet them.

29:37.584 --> 29:39.335
Don't give me that guff.

29:41.588 --> 29:43.548
I think we'll pass.

29:50.097 --> 29:51.347
Pagoda...

29:51.431 --> 29:54.433
where's my Havelina?

29:56.436 --> 29:58.396
I'll say good-night
to you now, children.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.814
Dad.

30:03.777 --> 30:05.945
Thank you, my sweet boy.

30:09.449 --> 30:11.534
I'll contact you
in the next 12 hours

30:11.618 --> 30:13.244
with further instructions.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.212
Look at that old

30:23.297 --> 30:25.965
grizzly bear.

30:26.049 --> 30:28.175
Hello, Ethel.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.510
Good evening, sir.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.470
Hold the cab,
will you, driver?

30:31.555 --> 30:33.055
Royal, this is Henry Sherman.

30:33.140 --> 30:34.307
Hey, lay it on me, man.

30:34.391 --> 30:35.391
How do you do?

30:35.475 --> 30:37.435
Not too well. I'm dying.

30:39.479 --> 30:41.230
How's Richie?

30:41.315 --> 30:42.940
I don't know.

30:43.025 --> 30:44.734
I can't tell.

30:44.818 --> 30:46.277
Yeah, me neither.

30:46.361 --> 30:48.237
He wrote me a letter.

30:48.322 --> 30:50.573
He says he's
in love with you.

30:52.242 --> 30:54.243
What are you talking about?

30:54.328 --> 30:55.745
That's what he said.

30:55.829 --> 30:59.040
I don't know how we're
supposed to take it.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.249
Hang on.

31:07.299 --> 31:08.716
Hello.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.593
Sugar, it's Eli.

31:10.677 --> 31:12.094
Hey, baby, give me a second.

31:12.179 --> 31:13.846
What are we doing, Eli?

31:13.930 --> 31:16.223
Oh, I just got to pick
something up.

31:18.101 --> 31:20.102
Don't repeat that,
by the way.

31:20.187 --> 31:21.103
About Richie.

31:21.188 --> 31:24.649
It was told to me in
confidence, and, you know...

31:29.738 --> 31:30.946
Good.

31:31.031 --> 31:34.408
Now just remove the loose soil

31:34.493 --> 31:38.287
and note the
decomposition levels.

31:38.372 --> 31:40.289
I'm sorry to interrupt
your work.

31:40.374 --> 31:42.500
Don't be silly.

31:42.584 --> 31:44.168
Come on.

31:44.252 --> 31:46.796
I just want to apologize
for the other day

31:46.880 --> 31:48.297
when I proposed to you.

31:48.382 --> 31:49.298
Why?

31:49.383 --> 31:50.716
I thought it was
very sweet.

31:50.801 --> 31:53.511
I know I'm not as accomplished
as some of the men

31:53.595 --> 31:55.012
you've been involved with.

31:55.097 --> 31:57.807
Uh, Franklin Benedict,
General Cartwright,

31:57.891 --> 31:59.183
and your ex-husband.

31:59.267 --> 32:00.559
Oh, that's ridiculous.

32:00.644 --> 32:02.228
But, but, I feel...

32:02.312 --> 32:05.147
I can offer
just as much as them.

32:05.232 --> 32:08.818
I know I went about it
backwards, but...

32:08.902 --> 32:11.278
Henry, I have no interest
in Franklin Benedict

32:11.363 --> 32:13.155
or Doug Cartwright -
I never did -

32:13.240 --> 32:15.950
and as far as Royal's concerned,
he's the most...

32:16.034 --> 32:17.451
Henry?

32:20.580 --> 32:21.831
Henry, are you all right?

32:21.915 --> 32:23.916
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.378
Anyway, let me know
when you make up your mind.

32:27.462 --> 32:30.339
Henry, wait a second.

32:30.424 --> 32:34.343
I'm sorry, I'm very nervous.

32:34.428 --> 32:36.178
Th-That's okay.

32:39.599 --> 32:41.517
Oh, thank you.

32:41.601 --> 32:45.146
Why are you so nervous?

32:45.230 --> 32:48.065
Well, to tell you the truth

32:48.150 --> 32:52.403
I haven't slept
with a man in 18 years.

32:52.487 --> 32:54.530
# Dah-dah-dum #

32:59.035 --> 33:02.037
# Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah,
dah-dum #

33:06.209 --> 33:09.211
# Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah #

33:12.632 --> 33:15.634
# Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah... #

33:19.639 --> 33:23.309
# La-dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah... #

33:26.813 --> 33:29.648
# Lah-dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah... #

33:33.236 --> 33:36.906
# Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah... #

33:39.534 --> 33:43.204
# Dah, dah-dah-dah,
dah, dee... #

33:47.834 --> 33:54.423
# Dah, dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah-dah... #

33:54.508 --> 33:55.841
# Dah-dah, dah-dah... #

33:55.926 --> 33:58.469
That's a hell of an old
hound dog you got there.

33:58.553 --> 33:59.595
What's he go by?

33:59.679 --> 34:01.013
Buckley.

34:01.097 --> 34:02.932
Buckley, sit.

34:07.354 --> 34:08.437
You know who I am?

34:09.523 --> 34:10.438
I'm Royal.

34:10.524 --> 34:12.149
Have you heard of me?

34:14.360 --> 34:16.110
I'm very sorry for your loss.

34:16.196 --> 34:18.822
Your mother was a terribly
attractive woman.

34:18.907 --> 34:20.032
Thank you.

34:20.116 --> 34:21.951
Which one are you?

34:22.034 --> 34:23.118
Ari.

34:23.203 --> 34:24.870
Uzi, I'm your granddad.

34:24.955 --> 34:26.163
Hello.

34:26.248 --> 34:28.791
I'm sorry we haven't gotten
to know each other.

34:28.875 --> 34:30.918
I don't get invited around
very much.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.295
What do you think of that,
by the way?

34:33.380 --> 34:34.547
Oh, you...

34:34.630 --> 34:36.632
you don't have to say anything.

34:36.716 --> 34:40.010
It's kind of a "fuck you"
to the old man, I guess.

34:40.094 --> 34:41.469
How's your daddy?

34:41.554 --> 34:42.429
Fine.

34:42.514 --> 34:43.429
You think so, huh?

34:43.514 --> 34:45.306
How often has he got you
working out?

34:45.391 --> 34:47.309
16 times a week.

34:48.436 --> 34:49.311
Do me a favor.

34:49.396 --> 34:50.980
Tell him you want to meet me.

34:51.063 --> 34:52.523
But we just met.

34:52.607 --> 34:53.524
No, we didn't.

34:53.608 --> 34:56.150
Look, I'd like us to have
a relationship

34:56.235 --> 34:59.530
but we have to pull some strings
to make it happen.

34:59.614 --> 35:02.783
Now, here's what you tell him.
You say...

35:02.868 --> 35:04.952
Well,
I bet Mom would have wanted us

35:05.036 --> 35:06.495
to meet him before he died.

35:06.580 --> 35:07.538
Wouldn't she?

35:07.622 --> 35:09.164
Don't you think?

35:24.222 --> 35:26.724
She was a tough old broad,
wasn't she?

35:26.808 --> 35:29.059
I wouldn't know.

35:29.144 --> 35:30.644
Excuse me.
Come on.

35:30.729 --> 35:31.729
Oh, that's right.

35:31.813 --> 35:33.772
We've got another body
buried here, haven't we?

35:33.857 --> 35:34.857
Uh, hold on.

35:37.193 --> 35:39.153
Take some of these.

35:41.114 --> 35:42.406
Come on.

35:46.036 --> 35:48.662
So what do you think of
this big, old black buck

35:48.747 --> 35:49.747
moving in up there?

35:49.831 --> 35:51.373
Who?

35:51.458 --> 35:52.625
Henry Sherman.

35:52.709 --> 35:53.834
You know him?

35:53.919 --> 35:55.252
Yeah.

35:55.337 --> 35:57.212
Is he worth a damn?

35:58.632 --> 36:00.966
I believe so.

36:06.389 --> 36:08.223
What happened to your finger?

36:08.308 --> 36:09.141
Uzi, shh.

36:09.225 --> 36:10.184
It's okay, I'll tell you.

36:10.268 --> 36:11.769
I'm adopted. Did you know that?

36:13.313 --> 36:14.271
Well, I am.

36:14.356 --> 36:17.566
When I was 14, I went to find
my real family.

36:17.651 --> 36:18.817
They live in Indiana.

36:18.902 --> 36:21.695
All right, now, just set one
of them hickory trunks

36:21.780 --> 36:23.781
right up top there,
sister Maggie.

36:32.540 --> 36:35.084
Did you try to sew it back on?

36:35.168 --> 36:37.711
Wasn't worth it.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.096
Hell of a damn grave.

36:47.180 --> 36:50.641
Wish it were mine.

36:50.725 --> 36:51.976
It's a shame, isn't it?

36:52.060 --> 36:53.352
What?

36:53.436 --> 36:55.938
Well, you probably had another
good two or three years

36:56.022 --> 36:57.439
of competitive play in you.

36:57.524 --> 36:58.649
Probably.

36:58.733 --> 37:02.277
I had a lot riding on
that match, you know.

37:02.362 --> 37:04.571
Financially and personally.

37:04.656 --> 37:08.701
Why did you choke out
there that day, Baumer?

37:08.785 --> 37:11.829
Mr. Gandhi leads 40-15.

37:17.961 --> 37:19.795
That's 72 unforced errors

37:19.879 --> 37:21.130
for Richie Tenenbaum.

37:21.214 --> 37:23.132
He's playing the worst tennis
of his life.

37:23.216 --> 37:25.134
What's he feeling right now,
Tex Hayward?

37:25.218 --> 37:26.552
I don't know, Jim.

37:26.636 --> 37:28.679
There's obviously
something wrong with him.

37:28.763 --> 37:30.973
He's taken off his shoes
and one of his socks

37:31.057 --> 37:32.808
and... actually,
I think he's crying.

37:32.892 --> 37:34.560
I think you're right.

37:34.644 --> 37:37.146
Who's he looking at
in the friends' box, Tex?

37:37.230 --> 37:39.064
That's his sister, Margot

37:39.149 --> 37:41.150
and her new husband,
Raleigh St. Clair.

37:41.234 --> 37:43.110
They were just married
yesterday, Jim.

37:43.194 --> 37:44.737
Oh, yes.

37:49.868 --> 37:53.037
I've never seen anything like this.

37:53.121 --> 37:54.997
Neither have I.

37:55.081 --> 37:58.375
Strange day out here
at Windswept Fields.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.961
I kind of disappeared
after that, didn't I?

38:01.046 --> 38:02.963
Yeah.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.966
But I understood.

38:06.051 --> 38:09.303
I know you're not very good
with disappointment.

38:15.185 --> 38:17.102
You still got that little BB

38:17.187 --> 38:20.355
in your hand, Chassie?

38:27.072 --> 38:28.530
Why did you shoot me?

38:28.615 --> 38:30.449
It was the object
of the game, wasn't it?

38:30.533 --> 38:31.784
No.

38:31.868 --> 38:34.286
We were on the same team.

38:34.370 --> 38:36.371
Were we?

38:36.456 --> 38:39.708
Well... you sued me.

38:39.793 --> 38:41.752
Twice. Got me disbarred.

38:41.836 --> 38:44.630
I don't hold it
against you, do I?

38:44.714 --> 38:45.714
And how is it possible

38:45.799 --> 38:47.674
for Mr. Tenenbaum
to withdraw these funds

38:47.759 --> 38:49.384
without your written
authorization?

38:49.469 --> 38:50.886
Objection, Your Honor.
Damn it, I...

38:50.970 --> 38:52.971
Why don't you leave
the objections to me, Royal?

38:53.056 --> 38:55.140
Because I started the
corporation when I was a minor.

38:55.225 --> 38:56.809
So, my father
was the primary signatory

38:56.893 --> 38:58.143
on most of my accounts.

38:58.228 --> 38:59.228
He also stole bonds

38:59.312 --> 39:01.855
out of my safety deposit box
when I was 14.

39:06.194 --> 39:08.278
You think you could
start forgiving me?

39:13.451 --> 39:15.244
Why should I?

39:15.328 --> 39:17.329
Because you're hurting me.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.415
Come on.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.045
Were you in prison?

39:25.130 --> 39:26.004
Kind of.

39:26.089 --> 39:27.589
Minimum security.

39:27.674 --> 39:30.134
I got jacked by the IRS.

39:30.218 --> 39:31.426
Should we split?

39:31.511 --> 39:32.427
Yes, sir.

39:32.512 --> 39:34.138
No, call me Mr. Tenenbaum.

39:34.222 --> 39:35.430
Okay.

39:35.515 --> 39:38.142
No, I'm kidding; call me Pappy.

39:38.226 --> 39:39.768
Okay.

39:39.853 --> 39:43.480
Come on, let's shag ass.

39:43.565 --> 39:44.940
Well, just let me know

39:45.024 --> 39:47.442
if you need somebody
to talk to, okay?

39:47.527 --> 39:49.069
I like Raleigh very much.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.446
I know he's a lot older
than you are

39:51.531 --> 39:53.782
and you two are having
some problems

39:53.867 --> 39:55.909
but... anyway,
maybe I can help.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.661
Okay. Thanks.

39:57.745 --> 40:00.622
Hey, Baumer! All right!

40:00.707 --> 40:05.627
All right! Ha!
Oh, shit! Oh, Jesus.

40:05.712 --> 40:09.047
By the way, I heard about
that letter you sent to Eli.

40:12.886 --> 40:15.846
You dropped some cigarettes.

40:18.391 --> 40:20.225
Those aren't mine.

40:20.310 --> 40:22.644
They just fell
out of your pocket.

40:35.575 --> 40:37.576
Oh, my Lord, look at you.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.333
Come in.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.338
Did you tell Margot

40:49.422 --> 40:51.590
about that letter
I wrote to you?

40:51.674 --> 40:53.800
Why? Did she mention it?

40:56.471 --> 40:59.181
Yes, I did.

40:59.265 --> 41:01.975
Why would she
have repeated that, I wonder?

41:02.060 --> 41:04.811
Well, I would ask you
the same question.

41:06.898 --> 41:07.940
Rightly so.

41:15.365 --> 41:18.242
What'd you say?

41:18.326 --> 41:19.910
Hmm?

41:19.994 --> 41:21.286
What?

41:21.371 --> 41:23.705
I didn't say anything.

41:23.790 --> 41:25.916
When? Right now?

41:30.588 --> 41:32.464
I'm sorry; don't listen to me.

41:32.548 --> 41:33.799
I'm on mescaline.

41:33.883 --> 41:35.884
I've been spaced out all day.

41:37.887 --> 41:39.888
Did you say you're on mescaline?

41:39.973 --> 41:41.807
I did, indeed.

41:41.891 --> 41:44.059
Very much so.

41:44.143 --> 41:46.478
How often do you, uh?

41:46.562 --> 41:48.230
I'm worried about you, Richie.

41:48.314 --> 41:50.232
Why?

41:50.316 --> 41:53.151
Well, actually, Margot is,
for some reason.

41:53.236 --> 41:54.569
But I did find it odd

41:54.654 --> 41:57.364
when you said
you were in love with her.

42:00.743 --> 42:02.411
She's married, you know.

42:02.495 --> 42:04.204
Yeah.

42:04.289 --> 42:06.581
And she's your sister.

42:06.666 --> 42:09.084
Adopted.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.513
Where are my encyclopedias?

42:21.597 --> 42:22.931
They've been placed in storage.

42:23.016 --> 42:24.766
Well, damn you.
You're taking my encyclopedias.

42:24.851 --> 42:26.435
- Th-this is humiliating.
- I'm sorry.

42:26.519 --> 42:28.520
Would you like to make
a complaint in writing?

42:28.604 --> 42:29.646
Where am I supposed to go?

42:29.731 --> 42:31.189
You're turning me
into a damn hobo.

42:31.274 --> 42:33.108
I'd be happy to make
a reservation for you

42:33.192 --> 42:34.776
- at another hotel.
- You son of a bitch.

42:34.861 --> 42:36.153
Frederick.

42:36.237 --> 42:37.154
Hello there, Dusty.

42:37.238 --> 42:38.780
Hello.

42:38.865 --> 42:40.615
Could you spot me a quarter?

42:40.700 --> 42:42.534
Of course.

42:43.536 --> 42:45.787
Richie? Hi.

42:45.872 --> 42:47.998
It's your dad.

42:51.336 --> 42:53.295
I think he's very lonely...

42:53.379 --> 42:55.130
lonelier than he lets on

42:55.214 --> 42:58.008
maybe lonelier
than he even realizes.

42:58.092 --> 43:00.802
Have you spoken
to him about this?

43:00.887 --> 43:02.971
Briefly,
and he agreed that we...

43:03.056 --> 43:05.307
I'm sorry, maybe I'm
a little confused here.

43:05.391 --> 43:06.725
What are you suggesting?

43:06.809 --> 43:09.061
That he come here
and stay in my room.

43:09.145 --> 43:11.646
Are you out of your mind?

43:11.731 --> 43:12.981
No, I'm not.
Anyway, I think that

43:13.066 --> 43:15.317
he'd be much more comfortable
here than he would...

43:15.401 --> 43:16.234
Who gives a shit?

43:16.319 --> 43:17.903
I do.

43:17.987 --> 43:19.154
You poor sucker.

43:19.238 --> 43:21.490
You poor, washed-up papa's boy.

43:21.574 --> 43:23.033
All right,
let's not get out of hand.

43:23.117 --> 43:25.535
Please, don't get in the middle
of this, Mr. Sherman.

43:25.620 --> 43:26.745
This is a family matter.

43:26.829 --> 43:28.997
Don't talk to him like that.

43:29.082 --> 43:30.665
- Call me Henry.
- I prefer Mr. Sherman.

43:30.750 --> 43:32.334
Call him Henry.

43:32.418 --> 43:33.668
Why? I don't know him
that well.

43:33.753 --> 43:35.045
You've known him
for ten years.

43:35.129 --> 43:36.755
As your accountant,
Mr. Sherman, yes.

43:36.839 --> 43:38.131
Where are you going to sleep?

43:38.216 --> 43:39.758
I'm just going
to camp out upstairs.

43:39.842 --> 43:41.259
We brought
our sleeping bag...

43:41.344 --> 43:42.219
Uzi!

43:42.303 --> 43:43.595
We don't mind, Dad.

43:43.679 --> 43:44.638
We like him.

43:44.722 --> 43:45.680
Who, Pappy?

43:45.765 --> 43:46.681
"Pappy"?

43:46.766 --> 43:48.517
He can sleep in
the room above us.

43:48.601 --> 43:50.143
Ari, it's not your decision.

43:50.228 --> 43:51.436
Nor is it yours.

43:51.521 --> 43:53.230
Well, he's already up there.

43:55.608 --> 43:57.359
What?!

43:57.443 --> 43:58.527
I think he's asleep

43:58.611 --> 44:00.737
because of the medication
he's on

44:00.822 --> 44:04.574
but I... I guess you can
wake him up and throw him out...

44:04.659 --> 44:07.828
if Mom says it's okay.

44:14.168 --> 44:16.962
Get out.

44:17.046 --> 44:19.047
All right.

44:19.132 --> 44:21.716
Let me just collect my things.

44:23.803 --> 44:26.388
Would you mind handing me
my cane, Richie?

44:26.472 --> 44:28.181
Let me see,
where's my suitcases?

44:28.266 --> 44:29.558
I'll get 'em.

44:29.642 --> 44:30.767
Oh, thanks.

44:30.852 --> 44:32.477
Oh!

44:32.562 --> 44:33.687
Dad!

44:35.148 --> 44:36.064
Mom!

44:36.149 --> 44:38.900
Grab me a Nembutal,
will you, son?

44:38.985 --> 44:40.735
Are you okay?

44:40.820 --> 44:42.654
What the fuck you care?

44:42.738 --> 44:44.573
Oh, my goodness.

44:44.657 --> 44:46.741
Pagoda?

44:46.826 --> 44:48.201
Call Doctor McClure.

44:51.914 --> 44:53.832
Take a breath and hold it.

44:56.294 --> 44:57.169
Now cough.

45:01.382 --> 45:02.966
His condition is stable.

45:03.050 --> 45:05.427
The attack was
just a side effect.

45:05.511 --> 45:08.472
I recommend you push fluids

45:08.556 --> 45:10.891
and continue the stomach cancer
medication.

45:17.773 --> 45:19.107
Can we move him?

45:19.192 --> 45:21.026
Absolutely not.

45:21.110 --> 45:23.195
For how long?

45:23.279 --> 45:25.113
We'll have to wait and see.

45:25.198 --> 45:26.948
Is he going to be all right?

45:27.033 --> 45:28.992
That depends. Is he a fighter?

45:29.076 --> 45:30.535
Yeah.

45:30.620 --> 45:32.370
Then that's the best we've got.

45:35.917 --> 45:37.459
Pagoda's in possession

45:37.543 --> 45:39.628
of a parcel containing
my will

45:39.712 --> 45:43.006
and some instructions
for the funeral

45:43.090 --> 45:45.133
including my epitaph,
for when the time comes.

45:45.218 --> 45:46.468
Proofread it for me

45:46.552 --> 45:48.845
before they carve it
on the headstone, okay?

45:48.930 --> 45:50.555
Okay.

45:50.640 --> 45:54.059
I never did stop loving you,
by the way.

45:54.143 --> 45:55.352
Do you believe that?

45:55.436 --> 45:56.978
Not really.

45:57.063 --> 45:59.523
You look terrific.

45:59.607 --> 46:01.358
That dress is stunning.

46:01.442 --> 46:03.443
Thanks.

46:25.758 --> 46:28.510
# Tears that angels cry... #

46:30.346 --> 46:34.015
# And the dark
and all the sky... #

46:34.100 --> 46:36.351
Lights out, old man.

46:36.435 --> 46:39.938
I thought I'd read
for a while, Chas.

46:40.022 --> 46:42.774
Sorry. 11:30. Lights out.

46:42.858 --> 46:44.693
I'm right in the middle
of a sentence.

46:44.777 --> 46:48.071
Well, you'll have to finish it
in the morning.

46:48.155 --> 46:49.322
Them's the rules.

46:49.407 --> 46:51.366
Chas?

46:53.703 --> 46:55.078
Good night, my boy.

46:55.162 --> 46:58.373
# When the one you love
says good-bye #

47:00.376 --> 47:04.546
# Sing a lullaby #

47:04.630 --> 47:08.550
# Dee-dee-dee,
dee-dee, dee-dee #

47:08.634 --> 47:12.887
# Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee,
dee-dee... #

47:12.972 --> 47:15.640
Looks like you and Dad are
back together again, huh?

47:15.725 --> 47:18.643
He's your dad, too, Chas.

47:18.728 --> 47:20.228
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

47:20.313 --> 47:22.147
You really hate me,
don't you?

47:22.231 --> 47:23.773
No. I don't. I love you.

47:25.484 --> 47:27.402
Well, I don't know
what you think

47:27.486 --> 47:29.362
you're going to get out of this

47:29.447 --> 47:32.616
but believe me, whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

47:34.660 --> 47:36.911
Chas...

47:36.996 --> 47:39.080
I don't want to hurt you.

47:39.165 --> 47:41.791
I know what you and the boys
have been through.

47:41.876 --> 47:43.752
You're my brother,
and I love you.

47:43.836 --> 47:45.629
Stop saying that!

48:00.269 --> 48:03.605
What's that jackass doing?

48:07.360 --> 48:09.861
I know you, asshole!

48:20.414 --> 48:23.291
Did Eli send you that?

48:23.376 --> 48:25.126
Mm-hmm.

48:25.211 --> 48:28.129
He always sends me
his clippings.

48:28.214 --> 48:30.965
What for?

48:31.050 --> 48:33.218
I think he just likes
the encouragement.

48:33.302 --> 48:34.594
He's done it for years.

48:34.679 --> 48:36.971
He used to send me
his grades in college.

48:38.224 --> 48:39.766
That's ridiculous.

48:47.525 --> 48:50.610
How long do you intend
to stay here?

48:50.695 --> 48:52.946
I don't know.

48:53.030 --> 48:56.157
Are you ever coming home?

48:56.242 --> 48:59.953
Maybe not.

49:00.037 --> 49:02.455
You're joking.

49:02.540 --> 49:05.542
No.

49:08.003 --> 49:10.213
Well, I want to die.

49:13.884 --> 49:16.970
Raleigh, please...

49:17.054 --> 49:19.222
Have you met someone else?

49:21.392 --> 49:23.309
I couldn't even begin
to think about

49:23.394 --> 49:26.396
knowing how to answer
that question.

49:32.403 --> 49:35.071
I don't like the way you're treating Raleigh.

49:38.617 --> 49:40.160
What are you talking about?

49:40.244 --> 49:41.619
You don't even know him.

49:41.704 --> 49:43.580
Well, I've met him,
and I don't think he deserves...

49:43.664 --> 49:46.708
Stay out of it.

49:46.792 --> 49:49.794
You're two-timing him
with that bloodsucker

49:49.879 --> 49:52.714
Eli Cash.

49:52.798 --> 49:55.717
Now, that's just not right,
damn it.

49:55.801 --> 49:57.886
You used to be a genius.

50:00.639 --> 50:03.057
No, I didn't.

50:05.144 --> 50:07.937
Anyway, that's what
they used to say.

50:14.153 --> 50:16.571
Richard,
I know you're terribly close to Margot

50:16.655 --> 50:18.823
and probably understand
her better than anyone.

50:18.908 --> 50:21.826
May I confide in you?

50:25.039 --> 50:28.625
Okay.

50:28.709 --> 50:31.211
I believe
she's having an affair.

50:33.380 --> 50:34.589
I'm utterly devastated.

50:34.673 --> 50:38.301
I... don't know
where else to turn.

50:38.385 --> 50:41.471
Will you advise me?

50:41.555 --> 50:42.597
I don't know.

50:42.681 --> 50:43.932
What do you want to do?

50:44.016 --> 50:45.141
I don't know.

50:45.226 --> 50:46.267
Perhaps, uh...

50:46.352 --> 50:47.769
Find the guy and get him?

50:47.853 --> 50:49.562
Well, no,
I thought we could...

50:53.692 --> 50:55.944
Who do you think it might be?

50:56.028 --> 50:59.364
I don't know at the moment.

51:01.909 --> 51:03.827
Let's look at the actuals, okay?

51:03.911 --> 51:05.954
I agree with you
a hundred percent.

51:06.038 --> 51:08.122
That's why we have
marketing grids.

51:08.207 --> 51:09.791
Hey.

51:09.875 --> 51:11.626
What do you say
we go down to Little Tokyo

51:11.710 --> 51:13.294
and get some fireworks?

51:13.379 --> 51:15.213
What do you need?

51:15.297 --> 51:17.382
Nothing.

51:17.466 --> 51:19.843
I see you got them,
uh, crunching numbers for you.

51:19.927 --> 51:23.471
Please don't
come in this room.

51:23.556 --> 51:24.973
Chas has those boys cooped up

51:25.057 --> 51:26.933
like a pair ofjackrabbits,
Etheline.

51:27.017 --> 51:28.476
He has his reasons.

51:28.561 --> 51:29.811
Oh, I know that

51:29.895 --> 51:33.147
but you can't raise boys
to be scared of life.

51:33.232 --> 51:36.484
You got to brew
some recklessness into them.

51:36.569 --> 51:40.154
I think that's terrible advice.

51:40.239 --> 51:44.158
No, you don't.

51:44.243 --> 51:46.578
We take boxing and self-defense classes.

51:46.662 --> 51:48.663
I'm not talking
about dance lessons.

51:48.747 --> 51:50.582
I'm talking about
putting a brick

51:50.666 --> 51:52.625
through the other guy's
windshield.

51:52.710 --> 51:56.963
I'm talking about taking it out
and chopping it up.

51:57.047 --> 51:58.756
What do you mean?

51:58.841 --> 52:00.174
# The mama pajama
rolled out of bed #

52:01.427 --> 52:02.927
# And she ran
to the police station #

52:03.012 --> 52:07.015
# When the papa found out,
he began to shout #

52:07.099 --> 52:09.767
# And he started
the investigation #

52:09.852 --> 52:10.935
# It's against the law #

52:11.020 --> 52:12.020
Go!

52:12.104 --> 52:13.187
# It was against the law #

52:14.648 --> 52:17.275
# What the mama saw,
it was against the law #

52:19.528 --> 52:22.238
# The mama looked down
and spit on the ground #

52:22.323 --> 52:24.782
# Ev'ry time my name
gets mentioned #

52:24.867 --> 52:27.243
# The papa said,
"Oy, if I get that boy #

52:27.328 --> 52:30.413
# I'm gonna stick him
in the house of detention" #

52:30.497 --> 52:32.540
# Well, I'm on my way #

52:32.625 --> 52:34.959
# I don't know where I'm goin' #

52:35.044 --> 52:36.711
# I'm on my way #

52:36.795 --> 52:38.379
# I'm takin' my time #

52:38.464 --> 52:39.714
# But I don't know where #

52:39.798 --> 52:43.593
# Good-bye to Rosie,
the Queen of Corona... #

52:43.677 --> 52:45.303
Come here.

52:45.387 --> 52:46.888
- # See you, me and Julio #
- That's it! Run!

52:46.972 --> 52:48.640
# Down by the schoolyard #

52:48.724 --> 52:52.727
# See you, me and Julio
down by the schoolyard. #

53:11.372 --> 53:12.789
Whoo-hoo!

53:12.873 --> 53:14.624
Yippee!

53:16.543 --> 53:18.586
He saved my life, you know.

53:18.671 --> 53:22.298
30 years ago,
I was knifed in a bazaar in Calcutta.

53:22.383 --> 53:24.926
He carried me
to the hospital on his back.

53:26.220 --> 53:28.137
Who stabbed you?

53:28.222 --> 53:29.305
He did.

53:29.390 --> 53:31.099
Yeah, there was
a price on my head

53:31.183 --> 53:34.268
and he was a hired assassin.

53:34.353 --> 53:37.814
Stuck me right in the gut
with a shiv.

53:47.866 --> 53:49.617
Hey!

53:49.702 --> 53:51.202
What?

53:52.371 --> 53:54.122
Where have you been?

53:54.206 --> 53:56.874
Uh, we just stepped
out to get some air.

53:58.210 --> 53:59.460
What's that?

53:59.545 --> 54:00.628
Holy shit.

54:00.713 --> 54:02.130
That's not?

54:02.214 --> 54:04.465
What is that?

54:04.550 --> 54:06.926
Oh, no, no,
that's, uh, dog's blood.

54:07.011 --> 54:08.302
Come here.

54:08.387 --> 54:09.554
What?

54:14.560 --> 54:15.935
You stay away
from my children.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.311
Do you understand?

54:17.396 --> 54:19.230
My God, I haven't been
in here for years.

54:19.314 --> 54:20.815
Hey! Are you listening to me!

54:20.899 --> 54:22.316
Yes, I am!

54:22.401 --> 54:24.944
I think you've having
a nervous breakdown!

54:25.029 --> 54:26.612
I don't think you recovered

54:26.697 --> 54:27.947
from Rachael's death.

54:28.032 --> 54:29.574
I...

54:41.253 --> 54:43.212
There you are.

54:54.850 --> 54:57.143
How are you feeling?

54:57.227 --> 54:58.936
I'm having a ball.

54:59.021 --> 55:02.315
Scrapping and yelling
and mixing it up.

55:02.399 --> 55:05.026
Loving every minute
with this damn crew.

55:07.529 --> 55:09.447
I want to thank you
for raising our children

55:09.531 --> 55:11.449
by the way.

55:11.533 --> 55:13.618
Okay.

55:13.702 --> 55:15.912
I'm not kidding.

55:15.996 --> 55:17.955
You always put them first,
didn't you?

55:18.040 --> 55:19.582
I tried to.

55:19.666 --> 55:22.627
Lately I feel like maybe
I didn't do such a great job.

55:22.711 --> 55:25.171
Goddamn it,
don't do that to yourself.

55:25.255 --> 55:27.090
I'm the one that failed them.

55:27.174 --> 55:29.133
Or, anyway,
it's nobody's fault.

55:29.218 --> 55:30.593
Plus, that - it doesn't...

55:30.677 --> 55:33.596
Why didn't you give
a damn about us, Royal?

55:33.680 --> 55:36.641
Why didn't you care?

55:36.725 --> 55:37.934
I don't know.

55:38.018 --> 55:40.728
I'm ashamed of myself.

55:43.524 --> 55:46.109
I'll tell you
one thing, though...

55:46.193 --> 55:49.153
you got more grit, fire and guts

55:49.238 --> 55:52.156
than any woman
I have ever met.

55:52.241 --> 55:54.283
What... what are you
smiling about?

55:54.368 --> 55:55.743
Nothing.

55:55.828 --> 55:57.286
No, wha...
what's so funny?

55:57.371 --> 55:58.454
Nothing.

55:58.539 --> 56:00.957
It's these little
expressions of yours.

56:01.041 --> 56:03.126
I don't know
what you're talking about

56:03.210 --> 56:05.545
but I'll take it
as a compliment.

56:07.673 --> 56:09.924
You're true blue, Ethel.

56:10.008 --> 56:12.218
You really are.

56:15.180 --> 56:17.932
How's your love life?

56:18.016 --> 56:19.600
None of your business.

56:29.194 --> 56:31.112
I'd like you to talk
to Royal about us

56:31.196 --> 56:32.446
if you don't mind.

56:32.531 --> 56:36.284
I don't think the timing's right
for that, Henry.

56:36.368 --> 56:37.785
Well, I'd agree

56:37.870 --> 56:40.955
if I thought he was really
going to die in six weeks

56:41.039 --> 56:43.040
but I don't.

56:44.710 --> 56:47.044
Well, I hope you're right.

56:47.129 --> 56:52.800
Actually, I don't believe
I'll join you tonight.

56:52.885 --> 56:55.845
I'll call you in the morning.

57:03.478 --> 57:04.687
She said that?

57:07.024 --> 57:09.317
Great.

57:09.401 --> 57:13.029
Got the sucker on the ropes.

57:29.838 --> 57:32.131
Can I ask you something, Hank?

57:36.762 --> 57:38.888
Okay.

57:40.474 --> 57:42.433
Are you trying
to steal my woman?

57:43.810 --> 57:45.603
I beg your pardon?

57:45.687 --> 57:47.688
You heard me, Coltrane.

57:47.773 --> 57:49.607
Coltrane?

57:49.691 --> 57:51.359
What?

57:51.443 --> 57:53.194
Did you just call me "Coltrane"?

57:53.278 --> 57:54.445
No.

57:54.529 --> 57:55.571
You didn't?

57:55.656 --> 57:57.865
No.

57:57.950 --> 57:59.992
Okay.

58:02.120 --> 58:03.746
But if I did...

58:05.374 --> 58:08.292
you wouldn't be able to do
anything about it, would you?

58:08.377 --> 58:10.044
You don't think so?

58:10.128 --> 58:11.545
No, I don't.

58:11.630 --> 58:12.797
Listen, Royal

58:12.881 --> 58:14.382
if you think
you can march in here...

58:14.466 --> 58:15.758
You want to talk some jive?

58:15.842 --> 58:18.219
I'll talk some jive.

58:18.303 --> 58:19.887
I'll talk some jive
like you've never heard.

58:19.972 --> 58:21.264
- Oh, yeah?
- Right on!

58:21.348 --> 58:22.807
- Sit down.
- What?!

58:22.891 --> 58:23.808
Wh-what did you say?

58:23.892 --> 58:24.892
I said sit down,
goddamn it!

58:24.977 --> 58:26.686
Oh, I heard you!
I want you out of my house!

58:26.770 --> 58:27.853
This is not your house!

58:27.938 --> 58:29.230
I want your raggedy ass out!

58:29.314 --> 58:30.523
Don't talk semantics with me.

58:30.607 --> 58:31.524
Oh, this is not your...

58:31.608 --> 58:33.359
What's going on here?

58:33.443 --> 58:35.403
Nothing.

58:38.657 --> 58:41.284
Mmm.

58:59.177 --> 59:02.263
Hello, I'm calling in regards
to a Dr. McClure - yes -

59:02.347 --> 59:04.056
at Colby General.

59:04.141 --> 59:06.600
The name of the patient
is Royal Tenenbaum.

59:06.685 --> 59:08.686
Hmm...

59:08.770 --> 59:12.815
Is that a Tic-Tac?

59:22.534 --> 59:25.286
How much is he paying you?

59:25.370 --> 59:29.290
I don't know what
you're talking about.

59:29.374 --> 59:31.959
Well, I grew up with the
Tenenbaum family, you know.

59:32.044 --> 59:33.044
Right.

59:33.128 --> 59:34.211
Across the street.

59:34.296 --> 59:35.463
Mm-hmm.

59:35.547 --> 59:37.631
They've fallen on hard times
now, haven't they?

59:37.716 --> 59:39.675
I can't say no.

59:39.760 --> 59:41.344
This is bullshit.

59:41.428 --> 59:42.720
Change it, huh?

59:45.223 --> 59:47.475
What did you do to your hand?

59:47.559 --> 59:50.394
Uh, nothing.

59:52.564 --> 59:54.648
Can we get somebody over here

59:54.733 --> 59:56.776
to kill these mice for us?

59:56.860 --> 59:58.819
No. They belong to Chas.

59:58.904 --> 01:00:01.530
Or anyway, he invented them.

01:00:01.615 --> 01:00:04.033
Well, get him to stick them
in a fucking cage

01:00:04.117 --> 01:00:06.452
or something.

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:09.997
Etheline... mind coming up here
for a minute, please?

01:00:10.082 --> 01:00:12.541
What's cooking, Pops?

01:00:12.626 --> 01:00:14.835
You'll see.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.503
Now, your previous novel...

01:00:15.587 --> 01:00:16.921
Yes. Wildcat.

01:00:17.005 --> 01:00:18.005
Right.

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:20.257
Not a success.

01:00:20.342 --> 01:00:21.967
Why?

01:00:26.598 --> 01:00:30.768
Well, Wildcat was written
in a kind of obsolete

01:00:30.852 --> 01:00:32.812
vernacular...

01:00:35.982 --> 01:00:38.234
Wildcat...

01:00:38.318 --> 01:00:40.945
Wild... cat...

01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:47.910
Wildcat...

01:00:49.287 --> 01:00:51.080
I'm going to go.

01:00:51.164 --> 01:00:53.374
I'm taking this off
and I'm going.

01:00:53.458 --> 01:00:54.750
Stepping out.

01:00:54.835 --> 01:00:57.545
What the hell
kind of way to act is that?

01:00:57.629 --> 01:00:58.921
Open the door.

01:00:59.005 --> 01:01:00.047
He's on drugs.

01:01:00.132 --> 01:01:03.426
I'll be right back.

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:06.720
James Bradley...

01:01:06.805 --> 01:01:08.639
Hold on a minute, please.

01:01:08.723 --> 01:01:09.849
What's going on?

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:12.476
Pagoda has something to say.

01:01:17.065 --> 01:01:19.608
He has a cancer.

01:01:19.693 --> 01:01:21.944
No, he doesn't.

01:01:22.028 --> 01:01:23.988
I know what stomach cancer
looks like.

01:01:24.072 --> 01:01:25.656
I've seen it.

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:28.075
And you don't eat

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.620
three cheeseburgers a day
with French fries if you got it.

01:01:31.705 --> 01:01:32.955
The pain is excruciating.

01:01:33.039 --> 01:01:34.957
How would you know?

01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:37.001
My wife had it.

01:01:37.085 --> 01:01:41.338
Not only is there
no Dr. McClure at Colby General

01:01:41.423 --> 01:01:43.424
there is no Colby General.

01:01:43.508 --> 01:01:46.051
It closed in 1974.

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.636
Aw, shit, man.

01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:49.722
Oh, shit, man.

01:02:00.525 --> 01:02:01.775
Yes, can you send a taxi

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.527
to 111 Archer Avenue
right away, please?

01:02:03.612 --> 01:02:04.528
Thank you.

01:02:12.537 --> 01:02:16.123
I guess we're back out
on the street, huh, pal?

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:18.459
Were you part of this,
Pagoda?

01:02:18.543 --> 01:02:20.044
Of course he was.

01:02:20.128 --> 01:02:21.545
No, well, yeah, he was

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:23.923
but, I mean,
he wasn't that involved.

01:02:24.007 --> 01:02:26.800
Where'd you get all
these medical supplies?

01:02:26.885 --> 01:02:29.345
A guy at St. Pete's
owed me a favor.

01:02:29.429 --> 01:02:33.140
I did some malpractice work
for him.

01:02:33.225 --> 01:02:36.060
I do have
high blood pressure, though.

01:02:38.772 --> 01:02:42.149
Look, I know I'm going to be
the bad guy on this one.

01:02:42.234 --> 01:02:45.569
But I just want to say,
the last six days have been

01:02:45.654 --> 01:02:48.489
the best six days
of probably my whole life.

01:02:48.573 --> 01:02:50.866
Immediately after making this statement

01:02:50.951 --> 01:02:53.494
Royal realized
that it was true.

01:02:59.042 --> 01:03:02.002
Why'd you do this to us, Royal?

01:03:02.087 --> 01:03:05.256
What was the point?

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.508
I thought I could win you back.

01:03:07.592 --> 01:03:11.512
And then I thought I could
get rid of Henry...

01:03:11.596 --> 01:03:14.223
and at least keep
the status quo.

01:03:14.307 --> 01:03:15.891
But we hadn't spoken
in seven years.

01:03:15.976 --> 01:03:17.268
I know.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:20.938
Plus, uh...

01:03:21.022 --> 01:03:23.357
I was broke.

01:03:24.776 --> 01:03:27.152
And I got kicked out
of my hotel.

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:30.030
You're a bastard.

01:03:30.115 --> 01:03:32.741
Good-bye, Royal.

01:03:45.297 --> 01:03:48.257
Take it easy
on those boys, Chassie.

01:03:48.341 --> 01:03:51.343
I don't want this
to happen to you.

01:04:00.812 --> 01:04:03.439
You know, Richie, this illness,
this closeness to death

01:04:03.523 --> 01:04:05.441
has had a profound effect
on me.

01:04:05.525 --> 01:04:08.485
I-I feel like a different
person, I really do.

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:13.157
Dad, you were never dying.

01:04:14.993 --> 01:04:17.328
But I'm going to live.

01:04:27.547 --> 01:04:30.299
He's not your father.

01:04:30.383 --> 01:04:33.260
Neither are you.

01:05:05.418 --> 01:05:07.586
You son of a bitch!

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:09.963
God... damn...

01:05:12.717 --> 01:05:15.094
That's the last time you put
a knife in me, hear me?

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:28.857
The 375th Street Y, please.

01:05:44.332 --> 01:05:46.375
Everyone's against me.

01:05:46.459 --> 01:05:48.377
It's your fault, man.

01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:52.131
Yeah, I know, but damn it,
I want this family to love me.

01:05:52.215 --> 01:05:53.340
How much money you got?

01:05:53.425 --> 01:05:54.675
I don't have.

01:05:54.759 --> 01:05:56.468
What, you're broke?

01:05:56.553 --> 01:05:58.929
You got to be kidding me.

01:05:59.013 --> 01:06:01.140
How are we going to pay
for this room?

01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:06.395
All right,
we'll think of something.

01:06:08.314 --> 01:06:09.898
Ow.

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:31.879
I'm not in love
with you anymore.

01:06:31.963 --> 01:06:34.548
I didn't know you ever were.

01:06:34.632 --> 01:06:36.216
Let's not make this
any more difficult

01:06:36.301 --> 01:06:38.051
than it already is.

01:06:40.138 --> 01:06:42.848
Okay.

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:45.642
Okay, what?

01:06:45.727 --> 01:06:49.646
Okay, I'm not in love
with you, either.

01:06:49.731 --> 01:06:53.400
Yes, I know;
you're in love with Richie

01:06:53.485 --> 01:06:55.778
which is sick and gross.

01:06:59.741 --> 01:07:03.327
Do you send my mother
your clippings...

01:07:03.411 --> 01:07:05.662
and your grades from college?

01:07:08.166 --> 01:07:11.710
Please stop belittling me.

01:07:19.219 --> 01:07:21.261
You never gave me
the time of day

01:07:21.346 --> 01:07:23.639
till I started getting
good reviews.

01:07:23.723 --> 01:07:26.683
Your reviews aren't that good.

01:07:26.768 --> 01:07:29.102
But the sales are.

01:07:36.194 --> 01:07:40.364
Gentlemen... how much
do you already know?

01:07:40.448 --> 01:07:43.450
Very little, I'm afraid.

01:07:43.535 --> 01:07:45.452
Would you like
to examine the report?

01:07:45.537 --> 01:07:47.955
Yes.

01:07:58.883 --> 01:08:01.218
# Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt #

01:08:01.302 --> 01:08:05.806
# They both went down to Berlin,
joined the Ice Capades #

01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:07.808
# And, oh, I don't know why #

01:08:07.892 --> 01:08:10.477
# Oh, I don't know why #

01:08:10.562 --> 01:08:12.938
# Perhaps they'll die, oh, yeah #

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:14.857
# Perhaps they'll die #

01:08:14.941 --> 01:08:15.816
# Oh, yeah #

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.569
# Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah #

01:08:18.653 --> 01:08:20.988
# Perhaps they'll die, oh, yeah #

01:08:21.072 --> 01:08:24.366
# Second verse,
same as the first #

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:26.827
# Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt #

01:08:26.911 --> 01:08:30.831
# They both went down to Berlin,
joined the Ice Capades #

01:08:30.915 --> 01:08:33.667
# And, oh, I don't know why #

01:08:33.751 --> 01:08:36.002
# Oh, I don't know why #

01:08:36.087 --> 01:08:38.337
# Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah #

01:08:38.423 --> 01:08:40.173
# Perhaps they'll die #

01:08:40.258 --> 01:08:41.216
# Oh, yeah #

01:08:41.301 --> 01:08:43.551
# Perhaps
they'll die, oh, yeah #

01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:47.014
# Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah #

01:08:57.274 --> 01:09:00.234
# Third verse,
different from the first #

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:01.528
# Jackie is a punk... #

01:09:08.703 --> 01:09:10.412
She smokes.

01:09:10.496 --> 01:09:12.456
Yes.

01:09:18.337 --> 01:09:19.462
All right, well.

01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:21.673
Everything seems
to be in order.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:24.718
I'll contact you
in the next 24 hours.

01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:26.219
I appreciate that.

01:09:26.304 --> 01:09:29.598
Uh, which way are you leaning,
by the way?

01:09:29.682 --> 01:09:31.015
I'll inform you of my decision

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.142
at the appropriate time.

01:09:32.225 --> 01:09:33.560
I get it.

01:09:33.645 --> 01:09:35.979
Uh, Dusty, put in a good word
for us, will you?

01:09:36.064 --> 01:09:37.481
I already did.

01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:44.863
You want to play some word games

01:09:44.948 --> 01:09:47.658
or do some experiments
on me or anything?

01:09:47.742 --> 01:09:49.743
No.

01:09:51.996 --> 01:09:53.663
# Your hand on his arm #

01:09:53.747 --> 01:09:55.832
# Haystack charm #

01:09:55.917 --> 01:09:57.709
# Around your neck #

01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.920
# Strung out and thin #

01:10:00.004 --> 01:10:04.216
# Calling some friend,
trying to cash some check #

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.969
# He's acting dumb #

01:10:07.053 --> 01:10:10.973
# That's what you've come...
to expect #

01:10:11.057 --> 01:10:26.571
# Needle in the hay #

01:10:40.044 --> 01:10:41.920
# He's wearin' your clothes #

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:43.505
# Head down to toes #

01:10:43.589 --> 01:10:45.841
# A reaction to you #

01:10:45.925 --> 01:10:47.634
# You say you know what he did #

01:10:47.719 --> 01:10:50.012
# But you idiot kid #

01:10:50.096 --> 01:10:52.389
# You don't have a clue #

01:10:52.473 --> 01:10:54.057
# Sometimes they just #

01:10:54.142 --> 01:10:56.268
# Get caught in the eye #

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.645
# You're pulling him through #

01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:02.566
# Needle in the hay #

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.401
# Needle in the hay... #

01:11:04.485 --> 01:11:06.987
: I'm going to kill myself tomorrow.

01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:10.699
# Needle in the hay #

01:11:10.783 --> 01:11:14.161
# Needle in the hay. #

01:11:57.497 --> 01:11:59.539
Dudley, where is he?

01:12:01.334 --> 01:12:03.210
Who?

01:12:06.047 --> 01:12:08.381
He'll probably sleep
for several hours

01:12:08.466 --> 01:12:10.634
and then I'll come back
to check on him.

01:12:10.718 --> 01:12:12.052
All right?

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.600
How are you feeling?

01:12:18.684 --> 01:12:20.268
Fine, thanks.

01:12:20.353 --> 01:12:22.771
Are you in any pain?

01:12:22.855 --> 01:12:24.231
Not really.

01:12:24.315 --> 01:12:25.440
Why'd you try
to kill yourself?

01:12:25.525 --> 01:12:27.109
Don't press him right now.

01:12:27.193 --> 01:12:29.402
I wrote a suicide note.

01:12:29.487 --> 01:12:30.946
You did?

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:32.239
Yeah.

01:12:32.323 --> 01:12:35.325
Right after I regained
consciousness.

01:12:37.203 --> 01:12:38.995
Can we read it?

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.122
No.

01:12:40.206 --> 01:12:43.416
Can you paraphrase it for us?

01:12:43.501 --> 01:12:46.002
I don't think so.

01:12:46.087 --> 01:12:48.130
Is it dark?

01:12:48.214 --> 01:12:49.422
Of course it's dark.

01:12:49.507 --> 01:12:50.966
It's a suicide note.

01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:52.425
All right, that's enough.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.344
Doctor said to let him sleep.

01:12:57.765 --> 01:12:59.724
What?!

01:13:03.729 --> 01:13:05.647
Cover for us, will you, Dusty?

01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:07.440
Yes. Yes, Royal.

01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:22.122
You've made a cuckold of me.

01:13:22.206 --> 01:13:25.292
I know.

01:13:25.376 --> 01:13:28.795
Many times over.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.465
I'm sorry.

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:34.801
And you nearly killed
your poor brother.

01:13:34.886 --> 01:13:37.971
What's he talking about?

01:13:38.055 --> 01:13:40.640
It doesn't matter.

01:13:40.725 --> 01:13:43.810
She's balling Eli Cash.

01:13:43.895 --> 01:13:45.896
Oh, my goodness.

01:13:49.066 --> 01:13:51.443
May I have a cigarette?

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:54.654
What?

01:13:54.739 --> 01:13:58.158
Shall I repeat the question?

01:13:58.242 --> 01:14:00.285
You don't smoke.

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.412
I know that.

01:14:13.507 --> 01:14:16.384
And a light.

01:14:24.018 --> 01:14:26.061
Au revoir.

01:14:35.363 --> 01:14:39.115
How long have you been a smoker?

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.785
22 years.

01:14:42.787 --> 01:14:45.288
Well, I think you should quit.

01:14:54.465 --> 01:14:56.716
How can I help?

01:14:58.552 --> 01:15:01.763
Let me look at these forms.

01:15:14.235 --> 01:15:16.194
Oh, Henry.

01:15:23.661 --> 01:15:25.412
Richie Tenenbaum, please.

01:15:25.496 --> 01:15:26.663
Your name?

01:15:26.747 --> 01:15:27.789
Royal Tenenbaum.

01:15:27.873 --> 01:15:30.959
I'm afraid visiting hours
are over, sir.

01:15:31.043 --> 01:15:33.837
Wh-Wh-What does it say there -
they don't want me?

01:15:33.921 --> 01:15:35.046
I-I'm sorry.

01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:36.423
I have to refer you
to Dr. Burrows.

01:15:36.507 --> 01:15:38.800
He'll be in
tomorrow afternoon.

01:15:52.523 --> 01:15:54.441
We could shimmy up
that gutter

01:15:54.525 --> 01:15:56.443
jump over that window ledge

01:15:56.527 --> 01:15:59.612
and then, uh, pry open
that ventilator shaft.

01:15:59.697 --> 01:16:01.448
There he is.

01:16:01.532 --> 01:16:02.866
Richie!

01:16:04.618 --> 01:16:06.536
Richie.

01:16:08.706 --> 01:16:11.207
Where's he going?

01:16:12.543 --> 01:16:14.878
Richie!

01:16:25.222 --> 01:16:26.806
Well, I have to say

01:16:26.891 --> 01:16:29.809
he didn't look half bad
for a suicide.

01:16:29.894 --> 01:16:33.146
Attempted, anyway.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:34.731
Thanks.

01:16:35.775 --> 01:16:37.650
# Please #

01:16:37.735 --> 01:16:40.236
# Give me second grace #

01:16:44.241 --> 01:16:46.034
# Please #

01:16:46.118 --> 01:16:48.912
# Give me a second face #

01:16:52.625 --> 01:16:55.794
# I've fallen far down #

01:16:55.878 --> 01:17:00.090
# The first time around #

01:17:00.174 --> 01:17:04.511
# Now I just sit on the ground
in your way #

01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:15.647
# Now #

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.899
# If it's time
for recompense #

01:17:17.983 --> 01:17:19.275
# For what's done... #

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.277
Who's there?

01:17:21.362 --> 01:17:23.738
# Come #

01:17:23.823 --> 01:17:26.991
# Come sit down
on the fence in the sun... #

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:28.535
Hello?

01:17:29.453 --> 01:17:34.040
# And the clouds will roll by #

01:17:34.125 --> 01:17:36.793
# And we'll never deny - #

01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:48.054
W- What are you doing in my tent?

01:17:48.139 --> 01:17:51.307
Just listening to some records.

01:17:51.392 --> 01:17:53.977
Aren't you supposed to be
in the hospital?

01:17:54.061 --> 01:17:56.312
I checked myself out.

01:18:17.877 --> 01:18:21.713
How many stitches
did you get?

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:23.465
I don't know.

01:18:23.549 --> 01:18:25.175
You want to see?

01:18:27.261 --> 01:18:31.431
# They seem to stay
for day after day #

01:18:31.515 --> 01:18:32.599
# And won't disappear... #

01:18:32.683 --> 01:18:33.850
Jesus.

01:18:33.934 --> 01:18:35.810
# I tried every way... #

01:18:35.895 --> 01:18:39.981
Richie, that looks horrible.

01:18:40.065 --> 01:18:43.651
I heard about your ex-husband.

01:18:43.736 --> 01:18:44.611
Desmond?

01:18:44.695 --> 01:18:45.820
I guess so.

01:18:45.905 --> 01:18:47.614
I didn't get his name.

01:18:47.698 --> 01:18:49.115
Yeah.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.451
I met him in the ocean.

01:18:51.535 --> 01:18:52.702
I was swimming

01:18:52.786 --> 01:18:55.705
and he came out to me
in a canoe.

01:18:55.789 --> 01:18:57.832
We were only married
nine days.

01:18:57.917 --> 01:18:59.626
And I heard about Eli.

01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:01.044
I know.

01:19:01.128 --> 01:19:05.632
Poor Eli.

01:19:05.716 --> 01:19:09.135
Anyway, they mostly
just talked about you.

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.971
They did?

01:19:12.056 --> 01:19:14.641
Yeah.

01:19:14.725 --> 01:19:19.896
I guess that was the attraction,
if you know what I mean.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:27.028
# She smiled sweetly #

01:19:27.112 --> 01:19:29.447
# And says don't worry... #

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:31.658
I have to tell you something.

01:19:31.742 --> 01:19:33.660
What's that?

01:19:33.744 --> 01:19:36.371
I love you.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:43.211
I love you, too.

01:19:45.923 --> 01:19:49.676
# There's no use tryin' #

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.303
# You're here #

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:56.641
# Begin again #

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:59.102
# And o'er again #

01:20:01.188 --> 01:20:06.150
# That's what she said
so softly... #

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:08.778
I can't stop thinking
about you.

01:20:08.862 --> 01:20:12.073
I went away for a year,
and it only got worse

01:20:12.157 --> 01:20:14.158
and I don't know
what to do.

01:20:14.243 --> 01:20:18.288
Let's lie down for a minute.

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.711
# She smiled sweetly #

01:20:24.795 --> 01:20:27.130
# She smiled sweetly... #

01:20:27.214 --> 01:20:29.340
This is the sleeping bag

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:32.260
we took to the museum,
isn't it?

01:20:32.344 --> 01:20:35.305
Mm-hmm.

01:20:35.389 --> 01:20:37.682
# Oh, no, no, no... #

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.642
Why'd you do it?

01:20:39.727 --> 01:20:42.437
Because of me?

01:20:42.521 --> 01:20:45.732
Yeah, but it's not your fault.

01:20:50.362 --> 01:20:54.115
You're not going
to do it again, are you?

01:20:54.199 --> 01:20:55.825
I doubt it.

01:20:57.661 --> 01:21:00.330
# She would never say #

01:21:00.414 --> 01:21:03.249
# Where she came from... #

01:21:06.712 --> 01:21:10.214
# Yesterday don't matter #

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:12.550
# If it's gone #

01:21:16.597 --> 01:21:18.598
# While the sun is bright #

01:21:20.517 --> 01:21:23.353
# Or in the darkest night #

01:21:23.437 --> 01:21:25.104
# No one knows... #

01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:27.023
I think we're just going
to have to be

01:21:27.107 --> 01:21:28.691
secretly in love with each other

01:21:28.776 --> 01:21:30.360
and leave it at that, Richie.

01:21:34.698 --> 01:21:38.618
# Good-bye, Ruby Tuesday #

01:21:38.702 --> 01:21:43.289
# Who could hang a name
on you? #

01:21:43.374 --> 01:21:47.794
# When you change
with every new day #

01:21:47.878 --> 01:21:50.963
# Still I'm gonna miss you... #

01:21:51.048 --> 01:21:52.965
Lobby floor.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.220
Thank you, sir.

01:22:03.227 --> 01:22:04.977
Going up?

01:22:05.062 --> 01:22:06.312
Yeah.

01:22:06.397 --> 01:22:07.647
What floor, sir?

01:22:07.731 --> 01:22:09.732
Doesn't matter.

01:22:17.741 --> 01:22:19.158
So, you're
elevator operators now?

01:22:19.243 --> 01:22:20.326
Yeah, just started.

01:22:20.411 --> 01:22:22.328
We'll get a bump as soon
as we join the union.

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:26.290
What made you decide
to do that?

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.167
We're broke.

01:22:28.252 --> 01:22:31.212
But in answer to your question

01:22:31.296 --> 01:22:32.255
I wanted to prove

01:22:32.339 --> 01:22:33.840
I could pay my dues,
and whatnot.

01:22:33.924 --> 01:22:37.343
I just hope
somebody notices.

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:42.974
You asked me
why I choked out there that day.

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:44.475
I think I may know the answer

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.060
and I wanted your advice.

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:49.439
Sure.

01:22:56.864 --> 01:22:58.448
Margot Tenenbaum?

01:22:58.532 --> 01:22:59.449
Yeah.

01:22:59.533 --> 01:23:01.409
Well, since when?

01:23:01.493 --> 01:23:04.287
Since always.

01:23:04.371 --> 01:23:05.413
Does she know?

01:23:05.497 --> 01:23:06.956
Uh-huh.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.293
Well, what does she feel
about that?

01:23:10.377 --> 01:23:11.961
I think she feels confused.

01:23:12.045 --> 01:23:13.129
Well, I can understand that.

01:23:13.213 --> 01:23:14.672
It's probably illegal.

01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:16.048
I don't think so.

01:23:16.133 --> 01:23:18.301
We're not related by blood.

01:23:18.385 --> 01:23:20.136
That's true.

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.305
Still frowned upon.

01:23:22.389 --> 01:23:25.516
But then, what isn't
these days, right?

01:23:34.818 --> 01:23:36.235
I don't know, maybe it works.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.403
Why not, what the hell.

01:23:37.488 --> 01:23:38.946
You love each other.

01:23:39.031 --> 01:23:42.074
Nobody knows
what's going to happen, so...

01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:43.659
You know something.

01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:47.455
Don't listen to me.

01:23:47.539 --> 01:23:49.540
I never understood her myself.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.626
I never understood any of us.

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:53.252
I wish I could tell you
what to do

01:23:53.337 --> 01:23:55.505
but I just can't.

01:23:56.715 --> 01:23:58.257
That's okay.

01:23:58.342 --> 01:24:01.427
No, it's not.

01:24:01.512 --> 01:24:04.764
You still consider me
your father?

01:24:04.848 --> 01:24:08.434
Sure, I do.

01:24:08.519 --> 01:24:12.271
I wish I had more to offer
in that department.

01:24:12.356 --> 01:24:15.358
I know you do, Pop.

01:24:21.198 --> 01:24:23.074
I don't blame you, by the way.

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:25.493
Uh, she's a
great-looking girl

01:24:25.577 --> 01:24:26.953
and smart as a whip.

01:24:27.037 --> 01:24:28.454
Mordecai.

01:24:28.539 --> 01:24:36.295
# Stephanie says
that she wants to know #

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:40.800
# Why she's given
half her life #

01:24:40.884 --> 01:24:45.137
# To people she hates now... #

01:24:45.222 --> 01:24:47.306
Holy shit.

01:24:47.391 --> 01:24:50.309
You came back.

01:24:50.394 --> 01:24:51.477
Jiminy crickets.

01:24:51.562 --> 01:24:54.814
That damn bird must
have radar in its brain.

01:24:54.898 --> 01:24:56.148
Is that true, Mordecai?

01:24:56.233 --> 01:24:58.150
I-I'm not so sure
this is Mordecai.

01:24:58.235 --> 01:24:59.318
What do you mean?

01:24:59.403 --> 01:25:00.653
He flew right in here.

01:25:00.737 --> 01:25:03.072
This bird has much more
white feathers on him.

01:25:05.742 --> 01:25:08.995
Oh, the son of a bitch
must be molting.

01:25:09.079 --> 01:25:11.664
Oh. I need your help
with something else.

01:25:11.748 --> 01:25:13.332
You got it.
What's the situation?

01:25:13.417 --> 01:25:15.001
Well, um, I think Eli maybe...

01:25:15.085 --> 01:25:16.711
Hold it.

01:25:16.795 --> 01:25:19.297
Pagoda, meet me in the lobby.

01:25:19.381 --> 01:25:20.590
Let's hit it.

01:25:22.801 --> 01:25:26.012
I didn't mean right this second,
but... that's okay.

01:25:26.096 --> 01:25:28.639
I don't think it was Ramses.

01:25:28.724 --> 01:25:30.016
I believe it was Tootinkamen.

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.183
Tutankhamen.

01:25:31.268 --> 01:25:32.435
Tutankhamen?

01:25:32.519 --> 01:25:33.686
Yes. Tutankhamen.

01:25:38.525 --> 01:25:40.735
Yes?

01:25:45.115 --> 01:25:47.116
Hey, Richie.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:56.959
We want to take you
to get some help.

01:25:58.837 --> 01:26:00.880
Is it just you guys?

01:26:00.964 --> 01:26:03.132
Would you

01:26:03.216 --> 01:26:04.300
excuse us, please?

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.888
Okay.

01:26:17.314 --> 01:26:19.357
Are we still friends?

01:26:21.193 --> 01:26:22.276
What do you mean?

01:26:22.361 --> 01:26:23.444
Are we?

01:26:23.528 --> 01:26:24.612
Of course.

01:26:24.696 --> 01:26:26.656
How can you even ask me that?

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.074
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:26:28.158 --> 01:26:29.158
It doesn't matter?

01:26:29.242 --> 01:26:30.409
It does matter.

01:26:30.494 --> 01:26:32.954
I heard about you and Margot.

01:26:43.423 --> 01:26:44.632
I'm sorry.

01:26:44.716 --> 01:26:45.967
I don't know what to say.

01:26:46.051 --> 01:26:47.969
You don't have to say anything.

01:26:48.053 --> 01:26:52.598
I always wanted
to be a Tenenbaum, you know.

01:26:52.683 --> 01:26:55.184
Me, too.

01:26:55.268 --> 01:26:57.436
Course it doesn't mean

01:26:57.521 --> 01:27:00.356
what it used to though, does it?

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.900
I wish you'd done this for me
when I was a kid.

01:27:05.112 --> 01:27:07.530
But you didn't have
a drug problem then.

01:27:09.116 --> 01:27:11.659
Yeah, but it would've
meant a lot to me.

01:27:11.743 --> 01:27:13.744
Anyway, I'm glad
you're here now.

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:17.248
I recognize
that I have a problem...

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:20.793
and I want to get better.

01:27:22.921 --> 01:27:24.922
I'll just grab my stuff.

01:27:34.933 --> 01:27:36.976
There he goes.

01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.185
What?!

01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:39.186
There he goes.

01:27:39.271 --> 01:27:40.563
Tucker!

01:27:40.647 --> 01:27:42.314
Skiddly, skiddly.

01:27:49.406 --> 01:27:53.617
# Christmastime is here #

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:56.037
# Happiness and cheer... #

01:27:56.121 --> 01:27:59.498
I'd like to order some ice cream
for my daughter, please.

01:27:59.583 --> 01:28:00.833
What would you like, Margot?

01:28:00.917 --> 01:28:03.711
Nothing. I told you
I have to go in five minutes.

01:28:03.795 --> 01:28:05.796
Oh.

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:11.177
I'll have a butterscotch sundae,
I guess.

01:28:17.142 --> 01:28:19.894
Your brother's all torn up
inside.

01:28:19.978 --> 01:28:23.189
Well, so am I, but I'm not going
to discuss it with you.

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:26.817
Oh...

01:28:26.902 --> 01:28:28.778
Can't somebody be a shit
their whole life

01:28:28.862 --> 01:28:30.154
and try to repair the damage?

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:33.699
I-I mean, I think people want
to hear that.

01:28:33.784 --> 01:28:34.700
Do they?

01:28:34.785 --> 01:28:35.701
Mmm.

01:28:35.786 --> 01:28:37.536
You probably don't even know

01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:39.705
my middle name.

01:28:43.168 --> 01:28:45.711
That's a trick question.

01:28:45.796 --> 01:28:47.046
You don't have one.

01:28:47.130 --> 01:28:48.380
Helen.

01:28:48.465 --> 01:28:51.550
That was my mother's name.

01:28:51.635 --> 01:28:54.553
I know it was.

01:29:08.527 --> 01:29:11.028
Anybody interested
in grabbing a couple burgers

01:29:11.113 --> 01:29:13.155
and hitting the cemetery?

01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:37.263
I got something for you, Ethel.

01:29:37.347 --> 01:29:38.722
Actually, I made it.

01:29:38.807 --> 01:29:40.141
What's this?

01:29:40.225 --> 01:29:41.433
It's a divorce.

01:29:41.518 --> 01:29:43.269
From you?

01:29:43.353 --> 01:29:44.436
Yes.

01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:45.646
This is Sanchez.

01:29:45.730 --> 01:29:46.814
He's a notary public.

01:29:46.898 --> 01:29:47.940
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

01:29:48.024 --> 01:29:49.233
You just sign here

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:51.443
and initial here
and sign there.

01:29:53.864 --> 01:29:56.282
You own this building,
don't you, Henry?

01:29:56.366 --> 01:29:58.325
Hmm.

01:29:58.410 --> 01:30:00.953
It's magnificent.

01:30:01.037 --> 01:30:02.872
I used to be a homeowner myself

01:30:02.956 --> 01:30:05.332
until our son expropriated it
from me.

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:07.626
I got to catch my bus.

01:30:07.711 --> 01:30:08.836
Thanks, Sanchez.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.129
You're welcome.

01:30:10.213 --> 01:30:11.964
Are we divorced?

01:30:12.048 --> 01:30:13.174
Almost.

01:30:13.258 --> 01:30:15.467
Sanchez just has
to file the papers.

01:30:15.552 --> 01:30:16.969
I love you, Etheline.

01:30:17.053 --> 01:30:19.638
Congratulations
to both of you.

01:30:19.723 --> 01:30:21.599
I didn't think so much
of him at first.

01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:22.808
But now I get it.

01:30:22.893 --> 01:30:24.977
He's everything that I'm not.

01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:31.901
Take back Pagoda, will you?

01:31:05.644 --> 01:31:06.977
Uh, slightly uneven.

01:31:07.062 --> 01:31:08.896
Looks okay.
You're just nervous.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:11.899
Henry?

01:31:11.983 --> 01:31:13.025
Hello, Richie.

01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:14.235
Hi.

01:31:14.319 --> 01:31:16.278
This is my son, Walter Sherman.

01:31:16.363 --> 01:31:19.114
Hi, Walter.
Nice to meet you.

01:31:19.199 --> 01:31:20.407
Nice to meet you.

01:31:20.492 --> 01:31:21.659
Henry's your dad?

01:31:21.743 --> 01:31:24.036
Yes.

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.080
So you've been married before.

01:31:26.164 --> 01:31:28.958
Yes. I'm a widower.

01:31:29.042 --> 01:31:31.043
Oh, yeah.

01:31:31.127 --> 01:31:33.629
I forgot.

01:31:36.132 --> 01:31:38.926
You know, I'm a widower myself.

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:44.723
I know you are, Chas.

01:31:47.394 --> 01:31:49.645
What are you chewing on?

01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:51.313
My nicotine inhaler.

01:31:51.398 --> 01:31:53.357
It's supposed to help me quit.

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:55.943
Is it working?

01:31:56.027 --> 01:31:58.988
Not really.

01:32:02.534 --> 01:32:04.243
Well, of course,
I'm half Hebrew

01:32:04.327 --> 01:32:06.787
but the children are
three-quarters Mick Catholic.

01:32:06.871 --> 01:32:09.081
So they were raised
in the church?

01:32:09.165 --> 01:32:11.083
I believe so.

01:32:11.167 --> 01:32:12.960
I really don't know.

01:32:22.804 --> 01:32:24.972
Here I come.

01:32:28.393 --> 01:32:29.852
Boys!

01:32:31.438 --> 01:32:33.147
What was that?

01:32:34.357 --> 01:32:36.567
Eli just crashed his car
into the front of the house.

01:32:36.651 --> 01:32:37.985
Oh, my God.

01:32:48.204 --> 01:32:50.539
Where's my shoe?

01:32:53.710 --> 01:32:55.794
Ari, Uzi, where are you?

01:32:55.879 --> 01:32:57.129
They're okay, Chas.

01:32:57.213 --> 01:32:58.464
It's okay. They're safe.

01:32:58.548 --> 01:32:59.923
They're safe.

01:33:00.008 --> 01:33:01.091
Dad, they ran over Buckley.

01:33:01.176 --> 01:33:02.092
What?

01:33:02.177 --> 01:33:03.802
Yeah, I think we lost Buckley.

01:33:03.887 --> 01:33:05.054
He saved them.

01:33:05.138 --> 01:33:06.180
Who?

01:33:06.264 --> 01:33:08.265
Dad. He pulled them
out of the way.

01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:10.309
You did?

01:33:11.644 --> 01:33:13.187
Did I hit anyone?

01:33:13.271 --> 01:33:16.231
Is everybody okay?

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:25.699
Eli!

01:33:25.784 --> 01:33:26.950
What's going on?

01:33:35.835 --> 01:33:38.128
Eli!

01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:40.214
What?

01:33:41.424 --> 01:33:42.925
Hey, man.

01:33:43.009 --> 01:33:44.927
You should try this.
It's very tasty.

01:34:05.949 --> 01:34:07.324
Tenenbaum!

01:34:09.661 --> 01:34:11.620
Chas?

01:34:35.937 --> 01:34:38.063
Did I hit the dog?

01:34:38.148 --> 01:34:40.149
Yeah.

01:34:42.902 --> 01:34:44.903
Is he dead?

01:34:44.988 --> 01:34:47.114
Yeah.

01:34:50.326 --> 01:34:52.327
I need help.

01:34:52.412 --> 01:34:55.914
So do I.

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.672
Go around to the other side.

01:35:03.756 --> 01:35:05.048
You kids stay there.

01:35:05.133 --> 01:35:06.216
We'll be right back.

01:35:06.301 --> 01:35:08.302
Yeah.

01:35:10.096 --> 01:35:11.513
Can I say something
to you, Henry?

01:35:11.598 --> 01:35:12.723
Okay.

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:14.391
I've always been considered
an asshole

01:35:14.476 --> 01:35:15.976
for about as long
as I can remember.

01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:17.394
That's just my style.

01:35:17.479 --> 01:35:18.479
But I'd really feel blue

01:35:18.563 --> 01:35:20.606
if I didn't think
you were going to forgive me.

01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:24.067
I don't think
you're an asshole, Royal.

01:35:24.152 --> 01:35:26.945
I just think you're kind
of a son of a bitch.

01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:29.364
Well, I really
appreciate that.

01:35:31.701 --> 01:35:33.660
Could you let us
in your backyard, ma'am?

01:35:33.745 --> 01:35:35.662
We've got a couple boys
back there.

01:35:35.747 --> 01:35:37.664
I think you may
have broken an ankle.

01:35:37.749 --> 01:35:40.459
Well, that's not terribly
serious, is it?

01:35:40.543 --> 01:35:42.836
Do you have an alternate?

01:35:42.921 --> 01:35:44.087
No.

01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:45.714
Ready?

01:35:45.798 --> 01:35:47.674
Are there priests on call?

01:35:47.759 --> 01:35:49.843
Why don't you bring
the car around, Anwar.

01:35:49.928 --> 01:35:53.180
At which point, I apparently
lost control of the vehicle

01:35:53.264 --> 01:35:55.933
smashed it into the house,
and killed that poor dog.

01:35:56.017 --> 01:35:57.643
You're Eli Cash.

01:35:57.727 --> 01:35:59.311
Yes indeed, I am.

01:35:59.395 --> 01:36:00.812
I love your work.

01:36:00.897 --> 01:36:02.648
Oh, how sweet of you
to say.

01:36:02.732 --> 01:36:04.483
DISPATCHER...
78-35, Code Six.

01:36:04.567 --> 01:36:06.485
105 North Sandler...

01:36:06.569 --> 01:36:08.820
I think he's part mutt.

01:36:08.905 --> 01:36:12.407
What kind of papers
do you have for him?

01:36:12.492 --> 01:36:14.618
Spark Plug, sit, sit.

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:17.329
Good boy.

01:36:19.916 --> 01:36:22.876
Put this on.

01:36:24.963 --> 01:36:26.129
What's so funny, Dudley?

01:36:26.214 --> 01:36:28.131
You look great.

01:36:29.801 --> 01:36:31.343
Can you see out of it?

01:36:31.427 --> 01:36:32.511
Not really.

01:36:32.595 --> 01:36:34.680
Uh-huh. Minor corneal damage.

01:36:34.764 --> 01:36:37.015
Page me if it spreads
to the other eye.

01:36:38.434 --> 01:36:39.518
Who do I make it out to?

01:36:39.602 --> 01:36:41.353
Alex? Okay.

01:36:42.939 --> 01:36:45.274
But these aren't
structure-bearing elements, Dad.

01:36:45.358 --> 01:36:46.692
It doesn't matter.

01:36:46.776 --> 01:36:48.652
It's still best
to file another force majeure

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:50.028
and recoup the deductible.

01:36:55.243 --> 01:36:57.411
You boys come up here with me.

01:36:57.495 --> 01:36:59.496
But Buckley's
still under there.

01:36:59.581 --> 01:37:04.459
I know, but there's nothing
we can do for him at the moment.

01:37:04.544 --> 01:37:06.587
Come on.

01:37:10.091 --> 01:37:12.426
I got you a new dog
for the boys.

01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:14.469
I just bought him.

01:37:14.554 --> 01:37:16.722
You did?

01:37:16.806 --> 01:37:18.974
Sorry I let you down, Chas.

01:37:19.058 --> 01:37:21.059
All of you.

01:37:21.144 --> 01:37:23.729
I been trying
to make it up to you.

01:37:30.153 --> 01:37:32.154
What's his name?

01:37:32.238 --> 01:37:34.239
Spark Plug.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.036
Thank you.

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:41.163
You're welcome.

01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:45.792
I've had a rough year, Dad.

01:37:45.877 --> 01:37:48.170
I know you have, Chassie.

01:37:55.261 --> 01:37:57.304
Hey.

01:38:17.909 --> 01:38:19.159
See, now he has

01:38:19.243 --> 01:38:21.119
more white feathers
on his neck.

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:26.375
I wonder
what happened to him?

01:38:26.459 --> 01:38:27.959
I don't know.

01:38:28.044 --> 01:38:31.046
Sometimes if a person
has a traumatic experience

01:38:31.130 --> 01:38:32.673
their hair turns white.

01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.551
Well, I'm sure
he'll get over it.

01:38:53.111 --> 01:38:56.196
This was one
of my first hiding places.

01:38:59.742 --> 01:39:01.993
How old do you think those are?

01:39:03.913 --> 01:39:05.831
I'd say about ten years.

01:39:08.292 --> 01:39:10.252
Come here.

01:39:44.287 --> 01:39:47.456
Royal dug a hole for
Buckley behind the garden shed

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:49.666
and buried him
in a canvas duffel bag.

01:39:49.751 --> 01:39:51.042
All right, boys.

01:39:51.127 --> 01:39:52.252
Say a prayer.

01:39:52.336 --> 01:39:53.879
Dear Heavenly Father...

01:39:53.963 --> 01:39:55.130
I do.

01:39:55.214 --> 01:39:57.883
Etheline and Henry were married

01:39:57.967 --> 01:40:00.552
48 hours later
in judge's chambers.

01:40:00.636 --> 01:40:06.558
Margot's new play was produced
at the Cavendish Theatre.

01:40:06.642 --> 01:40:09.895
This is my adopted daughter,
Elaine Levinson.

01:40:12.482 --> 01:40:16.818
It ran for just under two weeks
and received mixed reviews.

01:40:16.903 --> 01:40:20.113
Yes, can the boy tell time?

01:40:20.198 --> 01:40:21.740
Oh, my Lord, no.

01:40:21.824 --> 01:40:23.366
No. No.

01:40:23.451 --> 01:40:25.535
Raleigh and Dudley
went on a lecture tour

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:26.661
to 11 universities

01:40:26.746 --> 01:40:28.497
in the promotion
of their new book.

01:40:32.585 --> 01:40:34.795
Eli checked himself into
a rehabilitation hospital

01:40:34.879 --> 01:40:36.463
in North Dakota.

01:40:36.547 --> 01:40:40.926
Oh, hey, this is my sponsor,
Runs With Two Horses.

01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:43.762
Wind's blowing up
a gale today.

01:40:43.846 --> 01:40:45.597
This is the grip
that Rod Laver used.

01:40:45.681 --> 01:40:47.098
Are you familiar with Laver?

01:40:47.183 --> 01:40:48.892
Richie started a program

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:52.771
teaching competitive tennis
to eight-to-12 year olds

01:40:52.855 --> 01:40:54.856
at the 375th Street Y.

01:40:54.941 --> 01:40:57.526
Game. Change sides.

01:41:07.912 --> 01:41:10.872
Royal had a heart attack
at the age of 68.

01:41:14.710 --> 01:41:16.753
Chas rode with him
in the ambulance

01:41:16.838 --> 01:41:19.714
and was the only witness
to his father's death.

01:41:23.427 --> 01:41:25.554
In his will, he stipulated

01:41:25.638 --> 01:41:28.723
that his funeral
take place at dusk.

01:42:01.799 --> 01:42:05.385
Among the few possessions
he left to his heirs

01:42:05.469 --> 01:42:08.305
was a set
of Encyclopedia Britannica

01:42:08.389 --> 01:42:11.474
in storage
at the Lindbergh Palace Hotel

01:42:11.559 --> 01:42:14.519
under the names
Ari and Uzi Tenenbaum.

01:42:14.604 --> 01:42:17.272
No one spoke at the funeral

01:42:17.356 --> 01:42:22.027
and Father Petersen's leg
had not yet mended...

01:42:22.111 --> 01:42:23.945
but it was agreed among them

01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:26.489
that Royal
would have found the event

01:42:26.574 --> 01:42:28.241
to be most satisfactory.

01:42:31.621 --> 01:42:40.629
Fire!

01:42:50.806 --> 01:42:55.226
# We shall walk again #

01:42:55.311 --> 01:42:59.856
# All along the lane #

01:42:59.941 --> 01:43:04.694
# Down the avenue #

01:43:04.779 --> 01:43:09.240
# Just like we used to #

01:43:09.325 --> 01:43:13.870
# With our heads so high #

01:43:13.955 --> 01:43:18.500
# Smile at passersby #

01:43:18.584 --> 01:43:23.171
# And we'll softly sigh #

01:43:23.255 --> 01:43:27.592
# Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi #

01:43:27.677 --> 01:43:32.097
# Everyone, everyone, everyone,
everyone #

01:43:32.181 --> 01:43:38.186
# Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone #

01:43:39.897 --> 01:43:44.901
# By the winding stream #

01:43:44.986 --> 01:43:49.364
# We shall lay and dream #

01:43:49.448 --> 01:43:53.910
# And these dreams come true #

01:43:53.995 --> 01:43:58.456
# If we want them to #

01:43:58.541 --> 01:44:03.003
# Yes, all will come #

01:44:03.087 --> 01:44:07.632
# Playing pipes and drum #

01:44:07.717 --> 01:44:12.095
# Sing a happy song #

01:44:12.179 --> 01:44:16.558
# Yeah, we'll sing along #

01:44:16.642 --> 01:44:21.062
# Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone #

01:44:21.147 --> 01:44:26.776
# Everyone, everyone, everyone,
everyone #

01:44:59.310 --> 01:45:04.439
# We shall walk again #

01:45:04.523 --> 01:45:09.235
# All along down the lane #

01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:13.448
# Down the avenue #

01:45:13.532 --> 01:45:18.369
# Just like we used to #

01:45:18.454 --> 01:45:22.707
# With our heads so high #

01:45:22.792 --> 01:45:27.337
# Smile at passersby #

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:31.925
# And we'll softly sigh #

01:45:32.009 --> 01:45:36.221
# Ai-yi-yi-yi-
yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi #

01:45:36.305 --> 01:45:40.850
# Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone #

01:45:40.935 --> 01:45:46.856
# Everyone, everyone, everyone,
everyone #

01:46:02.331 --> 01:46:07.252
# Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah. #
