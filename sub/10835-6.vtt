WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:03.128
Previously on:

00:03.253 --> 00:04.880
Where do I know you from?
Are you an actress?

00:05.005 --> 00:06.423
I'm producing
this slasher film

00:06.548 --> 00:07.925
about Beverly Hills
cheerleaders.

00:08.048 --> 00:10.344
Why don't you both come in
and audition for me.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.137
Call me tomorrow--
we'll set something up.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.807
Sam and I are going
to visit Dylan.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.142
Well, how long are
you gonna be gone?

00:17.267 --> 00:20.354
The school gave me
a two-week leave.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.105
I think it's over, E.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.106
I think you're right.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.107
Why don't I stay here?

00:24.232 --> 00:25.442
Okay.
Okay?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.277
Okay, yes, I think
you can handle it.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.112
If we find out that
you're using illegal drugs,

00:29.237 --> 00:31.448
we'll have no choice
but to expel you.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.950
CONSTANCE:
Adrianna does not use drugs.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.327
Welcome to the big
leagues, little lady.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.464
(knocking on door)

00:47.589 --> 00:48.590
Well, you know, who
needs Big Brother

00:48.716 --> 00:50.258
when you got Facebook--
Mr. Matthews?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.051
Class, this
is Kimberly McIntyre.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.429
She's transferring to West
Beverly, starting today.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.097
Please make her
feel at home.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.307
Thanks, Harry.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.560
Uh, welcome
to West Bev.

00:59.685 --> 01:00.811
You can have a seat right there.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.145
ANNIE:
Hey.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.605
Can I just say
that I was the new girl

01:04.732 --> 01:07.735
up until... right now,
so I totally know how you feel.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.486
Well, I guess you
weren't very good at it

01:09.611 --> 01:10.487
'cause now I got the job.

01:11.697 --> 01:12.698
That's cute.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.199
Uh, you want to tell us

01:14.324 --> 01:15.492
a little something
about yourself, Kimberly?

01:16.785 --> 01:17.912
Well, why don't you just take

01:18.037 --> 01:19.663
whatever the old new girl
said about herself

01:19.788 --> 01:20.622
and just make it better.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.874
(students groaning)

01:21.999 --> 01:22.958
MATTHEWS:
Well, that's tough,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.252
because the old new girl
is from Kansas,

01:25.377 --> 01:26.795
and it just doesn't get
any better than that.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.839
There's no place like home.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.340
Right.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.842
Okay...

01:31.967 --> 01:34.845
so let me just talk about myself

01:34.970 --> 01:36.638
without feeling totally awkward.

01:36.764 --> 01:37.848
Don't worry, everyone
in this class

01:37.973 --> 01:39.767
has had their awkward moments.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.435
I'm Kim.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.644
I'm from Las Vegas.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.521
I wear size eight shoes.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.190
I have three piercings,
but I won't say where.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.735
And I like tacos.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.195
Great, I also like tacos.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.530
Welcome to the school.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.198
Any piercings?

01:55.323 --> 01:57.534
Moving on.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.787
MISS WELLS:
This has always been
one of my favorite experiments.

01:59.912 --> 02:01.705
You'll be paired off
into couples,

02:01.830 --> 02:04.625
all with different
socioeconomic backgrounds.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.961
By the end of the experiment,
you'll have taken care

02:07.086 --> 02:09.630
of your Real Care baby
and also managed

02:09.755 --> 02:12.466
the family budget
that you are each given.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.718
Uh, that's women's
work-- I mean, whoever

02:14.843 --> 02:16.762
I get paired up with
better recognize.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.055
(chuckling)

02:18.179 --> 02:20.766
Mike, you'll be paired
with Navid.

02:20.891 --> 02:21.934
Ho-oh!

02:22.059 --> 02:23.811
What?
What?
That's right.

02:23.936 --> 02:27.731
You are a same sex couple,
and Navid is the breadwinner.

02:27.856 --> 02:28.816
Um, I usually go for blondes.

02:28.941 --> 02:29.942
With boobs.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.819
Annie and Ethan,
you are married.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.570
Annie works.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.614
Ethan is a
stay-at-home dad.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.532
ETHAN:
Uh...

02:37.658 --> 02:39.576
do I have, like, a hobby?

02:39.701 --> 02:41.202
Your hobby...

02:41.328 --> 02:42.579
is your baby.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.914
Oh.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.415
Your unique wireless I.D.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.584
will track your baby care.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.378
The baby must
be fed, burped, rocked

02:50.504 --> 02:51.588
and diapered
around the clock.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.508
If you shake the baby,

02:54.633 --> 02:57.845
do not support the baby's head
or mishandle it in any way.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.805
It will register as abuse,

02:59.930 --> 03:02.599
and you will fail.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.935
(bell ringing)
DIXON:
Half-birthday?

03:05.060 --> 03:07.395
Mm-hmm, it's the six-month mark
between birthdays.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.481
You know how when you're
a kid and you're all like,

03:09.606 --> 03:10.774
"Oh, I'm four
and three quarters,"

03:10.899 --> 03:12.442
or, "I'm five and a half"?

03:12.567 --> 03:15.194
It's like every single milestone
is such a big deal,

03:15.320 --> 03:17.447
and then at some point,
you just stop counting

03:17.572 --> 03:18.782
all those little
in-between markers.

03:18.907 --> 03:19.867
Yeah, not me.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.451
I will always

03:21.576 --> 03:24.371
celebrate my half-birthday.

03:24.496 --> 03:27.082
You are a very strange girl.
Yeah?

03:27.206 --> 03:28.750
Well, I'm a strange girl
who's gonna have

03:28.876 --> 03:30.002
the most rockingest
half-birthday ever.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.253
Come on-- Psycho
at a cemetery?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.923
How awesomely perfect.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.634
Okay, tell me
you're into Hitchcock.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.427
I don't do horror movies.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.304
Why? You a little scared?

03:41.429 --> 03:42.848
(chuckling)
You scared,
you scared?

03:42.973 --> 03:45.308
No. I just think
they're stupid.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.519
Okay, A) Sometimes
that's the beauty of them.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.730
And B) Clearly, you just haven't
been initiated properly.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.774
Well, uh, maybe you can
initiate me the right way.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.317
I think I can.
Hmm?

03:54.442 --> 03:57.738
Okay, um, since I am
a high-powered attorney,

03:57.863 --> 04:01.616
the teacher says
you can take the baby
during business hours.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.994
No, don't... don't
you have day care

04:04.119 --> 04:05.495
at your fancy office?

04:05.620 --> 04:06.580
No.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.123
No, I don't.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.917
So, uh, hey, how's...
how's my nephew?

04:10.042 --> 04:11.835
Your nephew is a girl.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.961
(laughs)
That's what I meant.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.629
(laughs)
Um, I think you guys

04:14.755 --> 04:16.005
have things in reverse.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.007
First, you date,
then marriage,

04:17.132 --> 04:18.800
and then a baby, but, you know,

04:18.926 --> 04:19.968
whatever works
for you.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.720
No, me and Ethan, not so much.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.304
He is in rebound city,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.265
plus I take my
relationships seriously,

04:25.390 --> 04:28.476
and from what I've seen,
clearly he does not.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.353
And I need a guy
who's dependable,

04:30.478 --> 04:31.730
who I can count on, you know?

04:31.855 --> 04:33.356
I feel you.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.357
(laughing)

04:34.482 --> 04:35.609
(bell ringing)

04:37.861 --> 04:39.029
Well, hello, stranger.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.322
Oh, hey-hey-hey,
what's up?

04:41.448 --> 04:42.991
Not much... I just

04:43.117 --> 04:44.659
haven't really talked
to you in a while.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.577
How you been?

04:45.702 --> 04:46.912
Sit.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.916
So?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.876
So, how's Mommy Dearest?

04:53.001 --> 04:56.588
You know, desperate
to be Dina Lohan

04:56.713 --> 04:58.966
and making me suffer for
every second that she's not.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.341
How you holding up?

05:00.467 --> 05:01.551
I'm fine.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.803
Yeah?

05:02.928 --> 05:03.971
Mm-hmm.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.680
There's just
a lot of...

05:05.806 --> 05:07.057
talk going around, you know?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.516
I hear this talk,

05:08.642 --> 05:09.768
and I worry
about you.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.979
Yeah, well, that's
all it is, is talk.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.605
Rumors.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.899
Good, good.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.027
The only problem
I have is her.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.029
She's the one who got me
kicked out of the play.

05:21.155 --> 05:24.407
She's the one running to
Principal Daddy with lies.

05:24.532 --> 05:25.492
Today after school,

05:25.617 --> 05:27.494
she's auditioning
against me for a movie.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.537
How messed up is that?

05:29.663 --> 05:30.664
Weird.

05:30.789 --> 05:31.790
Whatever.

05:31.915 --> 05:32.833
Okay.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.126
I just... you know,

05:34.251 --> 05:35.919
I hear things,
and I know things.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.420
And I see you
putting eye drops

05:37.545 --> 05:38.880
in your eyes, and I...

05:39.006 --> 05:40.757
All right, it's called
allergies, Naomi.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.884
Can we not do
an intervention in the quad?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.136
Seriously, I'm fine.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.971
Let's do five
minutes on you.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.515
Um, Ethan and I broke up.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.684
My parents are getting
a divorce-- my whole world

05:50.809 --> 05:52.602
is just basically
a disaster, and I don't know,

05:52.727 --> 05:54.604
I just kind of need
my best friend right now.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.734
I'm sorry.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.611
Okay, I've just been

06:01.736 --> 06:03.030
really wrapped up
in auditions.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.364
I'm here... always.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.117
How about we hang out
after school today?

06:07.242 --> 06:08.994
Pinkberry and shopping?

06:09.119 --> 06:11.079
Ragging on our parents?

06:11.205 --> 06:12.622
Good times.
Good times.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.000
(both giggling)

06:15.125 --> 06:15.917
All right, wish me luck.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.127
I need a lot of it.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.129
Good luck.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.463
Hey, in fact, it's been...

06:20.588 --> 06:21.882
it's been a while,

06:22.007 --> 06:23.717
but, um... switch?

06:23.842 --> 06:24.926
Switch.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.053
It has been a while.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.721
For luck.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.264
For luck.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.142
Now, you're definitely
gonna get it.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.894
(both laughing)

06:34.019 --> 06:36.063
WOMAN:
Great, so I'll get the
invitations printed,

06:36.188 --> 06:37.564
and I'll call you
when they're in.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.606
I think it's gonna be

06:38.732 --> 06:39.816
the best fund-raiser
we've had yet.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.859
I have no doubt.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.736
I want to thank you both
for your help.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.071
Thank you.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.447
I'll see you soon.
Mm-hmm.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.158
Talk to you soon.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.411
Harry, can I talk
to you for a second?

06:53.621 --> 06:54.497
Sure, yeah.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.666
It's about our son.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.585
I mean, you know,
do you think about him?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.087
Do you wonder
what he looks like,

07:00.212 --> 07:01.546
what his interests are...

07:03.298 --> 07:05.342
Yeah, yeah, but that...

07:05.466 --> 07:07.052
I'm just trying
to figure this all out.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.137
I mean, I'd like to know
that he's okay, but...

07:09.263 --> 07:11.056
Knowing that he's okay
isn't good enough

07:11.181 --> 07:12.682
for me,
so I've decided

07:12.807 --> 07:14.184
to do something about it.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.186
Which is?

07:16.311 --> 07:19.439
I want to hire a private
investigator to find him.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.194
Please, please don't kill me.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.863
I am so not ready to die yet.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.199
I haven't even been to prom.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.701
Oh, I... I haven't
been asked, actually,

07:31.826 --> 07:34.495
but I heard that Rick Bartley's
gonna ask me,

07:34.621 --> 07:36.539
and I... he's...
he's Rick Bartley.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.250
You... you wouldn't
want to take that away

07:38.375 --> 07:39.876
from a young girl
in her prime,

07:40.001 --> 07:41.128
now, would you?

07:41.253 --> 07:42.670
Please don't kill me.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.215
I'm not, um... (sighs)

07:45.340 --> 07:46.883
Please don't kill me,
I'm not ready to...

07:47.008 --> 07:49.719
I haven't even...
I haven't even gone to...

07:49.844 --> 07:51.138
(grunts in frustration)

07:51.263 --> 07:52.139
Okay.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.308
Damn it!

07:59.313 --> 08:01.231

Whoa, whoa.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.959
Just... time-out.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.003

the only thing

12:34.128 --> 12:36.297

Yeah.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.895
I do.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.980
I was thinking

12:53.106 --> 12:54.608

12:54.733 --> 12:56.401
register
with the adoption agency,

12:56.526 --> 12:59.195
and someday,
if he wants to find me,

12:59.320 --> 13:02.781
or us, he can.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.246

Mm-hmm.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.237
Although,

13:41.362 --> 13:42.489

when you wear

13:42.614 --> 13:43.573
your hair straight.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.700
It's so much prettier.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.828
So, is Adrianna here?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.498
She must be celebrating.
She got the movie.

13:51.623 --> 13:52.999

13:53.124 --> 13:54.334
That's incredible.
Yeah.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.544
Oh, she must be
so thrilled.
We are.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.588
Especially after she botched

13:58.713 --> 14:00.047
her last couple
auditions.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.424
Ugh!

14:01.549 --> 14:04.177

her act together. Mm.

14:04.302 --> 14:07.096
So, wait, you don't have any

14:07.221 --> 14:08.765
I was supposed to meet her
today after school.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.975
I called a few times, and
she hasn't answered the phone.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.143
I'm a little worried, so, I...

14:12.268 --> 14:14.020
Oh, she probably
just got so excited

14:14.145 --> 14:15.605
about getting the part,
she forgot.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.232
Yeah, she's just...
She's off celebrating.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.293
It's an homage to The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

14:37.418 --> 14:39.379
and the character
of Captain Spalding

14:39.504 --> 14:41.548

want to watch

15:10.493 --> 15:12.328

I'm gonna sit through three?

15:12.453 --> 15:14.205
I... I gotta,
I gotta go.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.291
I gotta go.

15:27.802 --> 15:28.762
Grandma, you
don't see me.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.388
You just forgot to
take your blue pill.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.639
Did all the blood

15:31.765 --> 15:33.683
rush away from the part
of your brain

15:33.808 --> 15:35.351
that allows you to tell time?

15:35.476 --> 15:36.352

15:36.477 --> 15:37.604
Sneaking in.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.188

15:39.313 --> 15:41.566

15:41.691 --> 15:42.817
Don't worry; I won't
tell your mom and dad.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.235
Thank-Thank you
so much, Grandma.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.363
I meant I won't tell them
if you were with a girl.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.698
They know you're not here.

and a goat.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.230

I really hope
I get the wording right

Hey, this cannot

It won't.
Where was

16:32.575 --> 16:34.076
It... It-It died.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.458

Actually, I, uh,
already started dating.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.902
Okay. That was fast.

Kind of.
But that's great.

trouble with the rents?

17:31.425 --> 17:32.677
Oh, yeah.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.512
(laughs)
They're pissed.

17:34.637 --> 17:35.805
So pissed that they insisted

17:35.930 --> 17:37.807
on going to Hollywood
Forever tonight

17:37.932 --> 17:39.266
just to make sure I make curfew.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.520
All right, well, look, um,

17:42.645 --> 17:45.398
last night, I was trying to show
you something important to me.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.859
A House of a Thousand Corpses
is important to you?

17:47.984 --> 17:49.819
I was trying to share
something that I like with you.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.196
All right, all right. I'm sorry.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.656
It wasn't intentional,
all right?

17:53.781 --> 17:54.615
ANNIE:
Yo, be careful.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.742
What? It's not real.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.326
I don't want to fail.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.746
Show me one person who's
ever gotten lower than a B

17:59.871 --> 18:01.121
in health class, and...

18:01.247 --> 18:02.832
I don't even have
to finish that sentence,

18:02.957 --> 18:04.166
because it has never happened.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.293
So, you guys are coming
tonight, right?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.295
Not only is it
the most kick-ass movie

18:08.421 --> 18:10.006
to ever show
at a cemetery,

18:10.130 --> 18:12.341
but they also have
a Johnny Ramone tribute statue

18:12.466 --> 18:13.676
that I am dying to see.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.845
Yeah, me, too.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.388
Shut up.
You're making fun of me.

18:17.513 --> 18:20.725
So, you guys want to ride
together, or just meet there?

18:20.850 --> 18:25.312
I... Uh, yeah, I suppose
we could both go,

18:25.438 --> 18:27.523
you know, as parents,
with the baby with us.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.400
Yeah, yeah.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.360
It's, uh...
It sounds like a... a plan.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.486
Great.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.529
Let's do it.

18:33.654 --> 18:34.864
Hey, Wilson, go long.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.866
Hey, no! Don't go long!
SILVER: Hey, it's a baby!

18:36.991 --> 18:38.701
I know it's a baby.
It's a football baby!
Don't go long!

18:38.826 --> 18:40.411
Ethan, come on... no!

18:40.536 --> 18:42.538
So the concept of
the totalitarian authority

18:42.663 --> 18:44.206
in Orwell's book really coined

18:44.331 --> 18:46.459
the now ever-so-popular term
"Big Brother."

18:46.584 --> 18:49.545
STUDENT:
What does totalitarian mean,
Mr. Matthews?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.756
You look wiped.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.800
Late night?
Mm. Yeah. Very.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.718
Someone knows how to party.

18:55.843 --> 18:58.471
No, I was actually on baby duty.

18:58.596 --> 18:59.722
Baby duty?

18:59.847 --> 19:01.265
MATTHEWS:
Kimberly! Once again.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.558
Am I boring you?

19:02.683 --> 19:04.852
I did see the movie.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.520
Hmm. Not the same thing.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.730
And the questions on your test

19:07.855 --> 19:09.398
will reflect the book,

19:09.523 --> 19:10.858
not the movie.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.027
So, if you'd stop wasting
my time, I could maybe...

19:13.152 --> 19:15.738
Excuse me, Mr. Matthews, but
if I'm here, and you're here,

19:15.863 --> 19:17.073
doesn't that make it...

19:17.197 --> 19:20.701
Nice reference, Spicoli,
but didn't you graduate in 1982?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.286
Thank you.
I'm here all week.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.913
And you're going
to be here at lunch, too,

19:24.038 --> 19:25.414
'cause you just got a detention.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.667
(classmates groaning)

19:29.961 --> 19:31.045
HARRY:
So, Debbie and I have talked,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.255
and we have decided
to go forward with this.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.423
Yes!

19:34.548 --> 19:35.591
Hold on a second, Trace.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.093
I'm-I'm not into the
whole P.I. thing.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.053
I mean, we're not chasing
somebody down here, so...

19:39.178 --> 19:40.847
You know, we're gonna
have to write a letter

19:40.972 --> 19:41.848
to the adoption agency...

19:41.973 --> 19:44.224
Whoa, whoa, Harry.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.726
I already hired a P.I.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.979
What? What the hell
did you do that for?

19:48.104 --> 19:49.856
Look, I've waited
for 22 years.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.565
Besides, you know,
I just kind of

19:51.691 --> 19:53.818
figured that you'd come around,
so I went ahead and did it.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.736
Come on! Tracy, that's
not what we talked about.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.279
You come on, Harry.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.322
I know you.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.116
You want to know
how he's been doing.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.993
This has been killing you.
Tell me I'm wrong.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.577
Okay, yeah, I feel bad
about the whole thing,

20:03.703 --> 20:04.787
but you should not
have done this.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.497
Now, look, Harry, I get it.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.457
This whole thing
is a shock to you,

20:08.582 --> 20:10.334
but I've been
dealing with this

20:10.459 --> 20:13.212
every day since I was 19.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.298
Yeah.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.509
I'm sorry about that.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.972
It's really nice to finally
hear you say that.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.643
(cries and mutters)
Hey, it's okay.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.478
Yeah... Good...

20:29.603 --> 20:30.813
It's okay.

20:34.525 --> 20:35.526
Whoa. Whoa!

20:35.651 --> 20:36.944
Tracy...

20:42.366 --> 20:44.869
I'm going to pretend that
that never happened.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.495
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.455
Yeah.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
I hear this is where
the party's at.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.093
Uh, that's right, so you can
sit down and pour yourself

21:00.218 --> 21:01.886
a tall glass of Shut Up And
Don't Speak For The Next Hour.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.470
Does that come in Diet?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.639
'Cause I'm kind of
watching my figure.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.768
And that ends the conversation
portion of this detention.

21:08.893 --> 21:09.769
GEORGE:
I know you love
my company,

21:09.894 --> 21:10.937
but this is getting

21:11.062 --> 21:11.938
a little old, Mr. Matthews.

21:13.898 --> 21:17.193
The fact that I made out
with you in the fifth grade

21:17.317 --> 21:19.653
makes me want to
cut my tongue off.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.363
Do you have a girlfriend?

21:21.488 --> 21:22.907
(chuckles)

21:23.032 --> 21:24.324
That's none of your business.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.659
Are you gay?

21:26.827 --> 21:28.037
You seem kind of gay.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.706
Yeah, about as gay as your dad.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.666
My dad's dead.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.878
Hmm, well, I think your dad's
about as dead as I am gay.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.881
Touché.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.967
Shh.

21:41.092 --> 21:41.842
Yeah, good luck with that.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.136
Starting to see why

21:43.261 --> 21:44.470
you got kicked out
of your last school.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.889
You two sound like my mom
and my old soccer coach.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.641
Before the unpleasantness.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.350
Mr. Matthews,
do you have a second?

21:50.476 --> 21:52.979
Yeah, I do.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.897
I'm stepping out
for 30 seconds.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.565
George, I'll give you a dollar

21:56.690 --> 21:58.442
if you keep your trap shut,
and two

21:58.567 --> 21:59.652
if you learn
how to read.

21:59.777 --> 22:00.778
I can read, Mr. Matthews.

22:00.903 --> 22:02.780
I'm ignoring you.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.827
So... detention.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.578
Bad kids,

22:09.703 --> 22:11.789
any idea where a girl can score
some party favors?

22:15.084 --> 22:17.003
I waited for you
last night.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.754
I'm happy you got
the part,

22:18.879 --> 22:20.380
but why you didn't
call me?
You heard?

22:20.506 --> 22:21.799
Isn't it awesome?

22:21.924 --> 22:23.217
I was driving over
to see you and then

22:23.342 --> 22:24.426
I got the call that
I got the part

22:24.551 --> 22:25.678
and so I had to call my mom,

22:25.803 --> 22:27.138
and then I had to go
home and celebrate,

22:27.263 --> 22:28.764
and I was just, like...
That's not true, Adrianna.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.474
I was at your house last night
and you weren't there.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.100
Why are you lying to me?

22:31.225 --> 22:32.685
Can you just take one minute

22:32.810 --> 22:34.103
and be happy for me?

22:34.228 --> 22:35.688
I got the movie!

22:35.813 --> 22:36.939
Looks like

22:37.064 --> 22:38.691
our lucky necklace
switch worked!

22:38.816 --> 22:40.776
I think you can
have it back now.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.529
(mumbling)

22:43.654 --> 22:45.531
What-- wh-wh-wh-whoa, what?

22:45.656 --> 22:48.326
Are you kidding me
with this? Really?

22:48.450 --> 22:50.786
I know this lipstick
container, Adrianna.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.039
(scoffs)

22:53.164 --> 22:54.498
Are you kidding me?
What do you care?

22:54.623 --> 22:55.541
It was yours.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.043
Was mine.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.044
Not anymore.
I experimented

22:58.169 --> 22:59.461
and I stopped.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.130
Like you
supposedly did.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.631
Give me a break, Naomi.
No!

23:02.756 --> 23:03.924
No, I won't give you
a break.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.052
Okay, I'm your friend.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.553
And I may come off
as annoying

23:07.678 --> 23:08.679
or whatever
you think I am,

23:08.804 --> 23:10.056
but I care about you.

23:10.181 --> 23:11.807
And I'm worried
about you.
I'm fine.

23:11.932 --> 23:12.975
(slams locker)
You're not fine.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.476
And don't,
don't...

23:14.601 --> 23:16.145
Don't walk away from me.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.604
I can help you, okay?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.523
I can help you deal with
this, but you gotta let me.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.858
(dog barks)
OFFICER:
Everyone...

23:20.983 --> 23:22.026
please step away from
your lockers.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.152
We're conducting a search.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.737
Oh, my God.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.864
You take the south hallway;
I'll take the north.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.742
Oh, my God!

23:29.867 --> 23:31.744
Shh. Shh.

23:31.869 --> 23:32.912
NAOMI:
Shh-shh-shh-
shh-shh.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.163
Okay, you're right.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.706
All right, I'm using,
but it's...

23:35.831 --> 23:36.916
it's not like I'm addicted.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.209
I could stop
whenever I want.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.211
I'm just like, I'm just
under so much pressure

23:40.336 --> 23:41.712
from my mom
to get a stupid job.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.421
(barking)

23:45.841 --> 23:46.884
I finally

23:47.009 --> 23:48.094
work super hard
to get something

23:48.219 --> 23:49.595
and I'm gonna
get busted.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.180
I'm gonna get kicked
out of school.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.224
I'm gonna lose the movie.
I'm gonna lose
No, no, no, no.

23:53.349 --> 23:54.058
everything!
No! No, you're not.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.142
Give it to me.
What?

23:55.268 --> 23:57.728
No!
Just give it to me.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.442
MALE OFFICER:
This your locker, son?

24:20.209 --> 24:21.794
FEMALE OFFICER:
Stop whatever you're doing
and come out.

24:21.919 --> 24:22.878
(toilet flushes)

24:32.888 --> 24:34.807
Where'd you find it?

24:34.932 --> 24:35.808
The coke was in the lipstick.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.059
We'll copy you
on the police report.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.476
What the hell, Harry?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.313
Isn't there a better way
than busting kids?

24:40.438 --> 24:41.772
It's a little extreme,
don't you think?

24:41.897 --> 24:43.023
I don't want drugs
on this campus.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.066
And neither do I.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.651
But you get one chance

24:45.776 --> 24:46.986
to earn these
kids' trust.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.113
What, are you defending
drug dealers?

24:49.238 --> 24:50.030
Not everyone is a dealer.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.615
Naomi?

24:51.740 --> 24:52.741
Please.

24:52.866 --> 24:53.993
These kids have rights.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.619
They don't have right
to bring drugs to campus.

24:55.744 --> 24:56.662
This isn't China.

24:56.787 --> 24:57.704
It's Beverly Hills, all right?

24:57.830 --> 24:58.747
This isn't cool, Harry.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.249
Not interested in being cool.

25:00.374 --> 25:02.126
Or in your opinion,
Mr. Matthews.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.799
That was brutal.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.176
Big time.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.927
Those weren't her
drugs, Ethan.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.054
I know.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.225
ETHAN:
Come on, Adrianna.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.977
Just leave me alone.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.270
Did you see her
get busted?

25:21.395 --> 25:22.980
They took her down
to book her.

25:23.105 --> 25:25.107
Yeah, well, her dad
will get her out of it.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.692
Yeah, and then what's her dad
gonna do to her?

25:26.817 --> 25:28.068
She's probably gonna get
suspended no matter what.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.611
Maybe even expelled.

25:29.736 --> 25:30.946
She shouldn't be in this
situation, Adrianna.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.656
You need to step up and admit
the drugs were yours.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.325
Says who?
ANNIE:
Says me.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.202
I saw her take the drugs
from you.

25:36.327 --> 25:37.953
Well, for your information,

25:38.078 --> 25:40.039
Naomi's the one that initiated
me into the C&amp;C Club.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.790
C&amp;C Club?

25:41.915 --> 25:44.751
Cocaine and Champagne.
Yeah, but she grew

25:44.877 --> 25:46.253
out of it, 'cause she realized
how stupid it was.

25:46.379 --> 25:49.089
You can't just let her
take the rap for you.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.257
What do you care about Naomi?

25:50.383 --> 25:51.258
You're already
practically

25:51.384 --> 25:52.968
dry-humping her boyfriend.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.178
Ex-boyfriend.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.679
And she does care.
We both care.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.889
Now, if you care about Naomi--

25:57.014 --> 25:58.057
you'll prove it.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.819
Mom, what are
you doing?

26:10.944 --> 26:12.946
I'm doing what I should have
done a long time ago.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.823
I'm acting like your mother
instead of your sister

26:14.948 --> 26:15.908
or your friend.
You kidding me?

26:16.033 --> 26:16.950
Dad, she's tearing
my room apart!

26:17.076 --> 26:18.118
If I wasn't
bailing you out,

26:18.244 --> 26:19.328
I'd be doing it
right along with her.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.289
Great, you guys!

26:22.415 --> 26:23.290
There aren't
any drugs here.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.791
I don't do drugs!

26:24.917 --> 26:26.460
Well, you just got caught
red-handed.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.128
Come on, Mom.
You know I don't do drugs.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.380
What is this?
No, I know

26:29.505 --> 26:31.215
that you dabbled
with Adrianna

26:31.340 --> 26:32.674
over a year ago.
What I don't know

26:32.799 --> 26:34.134
is if your father leaving

26:34.260 --> 26:35.886
has made you
start again.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.054
That's nice, Tracy. Why don't
we just lay off the digs

26:37.179 --> 26:38.055
and deal with the issue here?

26:38.180 --> 26:39.306
This is the issue, Charles.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.433
You don't think
there's consequences

26:40.558 --> 26:41.975
for what you did
to this family?

26:42.101 --> 26:42.935
Okay, stop!

26:43.060 --> 26:43.894
Daddy, you can fix this.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.687
You can get me out of this.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.106
Can you just make it go away?

26:47.231 --> 26:48.399
I don't think
you get how serious

26:48.524 --> 26:50.150
this is.
I may not be able to.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.235
Sit down.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.278
What?

26:52.403 --> 26:54.280
Sit down.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.826
You're doing this
to get attention?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.995
No.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.330
CHARLES:
You're doing this
'cause you think

27:03.456 --> 27:04.831
you're gonna get your mom
and me back together?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.166
NAOMI:
No.
Well, I'm not

27:06.292 --> 27:08.168

a check-- not for this.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.004
This is gonna go on your
permanent record.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.256
You're gonna have
to be drug-tested,

27:12.381 --> 27:14.925
make court
appearances.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.885
Listen, if
there's anything

27:17.010 --> 27:18.304

tell us, you should.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.180

I'm sorry.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.287

be able to get you out of it.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.289
Yeah. Me, too.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.249
Apparently he can't.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.752
Well, maybe he can figure
something out.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.254
He's got

27:52.379 --> 27:53.464

28:05.267 --> 28:06.226

that the drugs were yours.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.067
It's gonna suck.
I'm sorry.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.735

career move?

hire you or not. Seriously,

if the drugs were hers,

36:18.718 --> 36:19.761

for you to go to college,

36:34.818 --> 36:35.944
to get a job,

36:36.069 --> 36:38.279
and you may have
to go to jail,

36:38.404 --> 36:41.867
which in your case
would be juvenile detention.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.294

37:28.830 --> 37:30.790
It's not.
Yes, it is.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.584
So, because
it's a first offense,

37:32.709 --> 37:33.793
and because
of the small amount,

assume anything here,

38:10.622 --> 38:12.540

with students before,

38:12.665 --> 38:16.002
so if you're having
any kind of feelings...

38:16.128 --> 38:18.755

you're my student,

38:18.880 --> 38:19.923

after that bust today.

Wrong.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.398
We did this now

39:19.524 --> 39:20.942
