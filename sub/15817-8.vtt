06:24.452 --> 06:25.553
FOR PUTTING 'EM BOTH TOGETHER,

06:25.553 --> 06:27.455
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN JOSELINE

06:27.455 --> 06:28.722
IS WRONG, SHE NEEDS TO ADMIT

06:28.722 --> 06:29.490
SHE'S WRONG.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.525
AND THIS TIME, SHE'S DEAD WRONG.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.192
SO LOOK.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.761
SOMETHING BEEN ON MY MIND.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.262
WHAT?

06:35.262 --> 06:36.229
THAT LITTLE INCIDENT

06:36.229 --> 06:38.065
THAT HAPPENED AT THE STRIP CLUB.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.266
[bleep] THAT BITCH.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.133
LISTEN.

06:40.133 --> 06:40.801
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

06:40.801 --> 06:41.469
ABOUT ME.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.135
IT IS, BABY.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.003
YOU CAN'T BE BRINGING UP--

06:43.003 --> 06:44.505
LISTEN. LISTEN.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.839
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.940
STEVIE, IF EVERYTHING

06:46.940 --> 06:48.876
IS ABOUT ME, WHY ARE YOU

06:48.876 --> 06:49.910
SITTING ME DOWN WITH THIS

06:49.910 --> 06:51.278
RATCHET-ASS HO?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.045
IT HAPPENED.

06:52.045 --> 06:52.980
LET'S JUST CLEAN IT UP NOW.

06:52.980 --> 06:53.814
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ME

06:53.814 --> 06:54.848
SITTING DOWN WITH NOBODY.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.717
THE ONLY BITCH THAT NEEDS TO BE

06:56.717 --> 06:58.486
IN A PHOTO SHOOT, IN A STUDIO,

06:58.486 --> 06:59.352
IS JOSELINE HERNANDEZ.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.020
ALL RIGHT.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.755
I AGREE WITH YOU.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.623
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

07:02.623 --> 07:03.491
I'M LIKE, "WHATEVER HAPPENED

07:03.491 --> 07:04.124
HAPPENED."

07:04.124 --> 07:04.825
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

07:04.825 --> 07:05.493
IT WAS YOUR FAULT.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.326
SHE DIDN'T WANT THAT,

07:06.326 --> 07:07.895
SO WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT

07:07.895 --> 07:09.229
WHAT WE CAN DO TO CLEAN THAT UP.

07:09.229 --> 07:09.897
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T

07:09.897 --> 07:10.564
BE FIGHTING.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.732
I'M WRONG FOR DOING THAT.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.500
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER

07:12.500 --> 07:13.501
PUT MY HANDS ON HER.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.503
BUT...

07:17.104 --> 07:18.038
BEING FROM THE STREETS

07:18.038 --> 07:18.839
WHERE I'M FROM,

07:18.839 --> 07:20.107
YOU LEARN TO GRAB WHAT YOU WANT

07:20.107 --> 07:21.374
BEFORE IT'S TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.209
AND I SEEN THIS BITCH,

07:22.209 --> 07:22.910
CHE' MACK, TRYING TO GET

07:22.910 --> 07:24.211
IN THE STUDIO WITH MY MANAGER

07:24.211 --> 07:25.412
AND MY "SUPPOSED TO BE" MAN,

07:25.412 --> 07:27.114
AND ALL I SEEN WAS RED.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.016
I KNOW I WAS WRONG,

07:29.016 --> 07:30.417
BUT I GOT TO PROTECT MYSELF

07:30.417 --> 07:32.019
AND MY CAREER.

07:32.019 --> 07:32.786
YOU HAVE TO SIT DOWN

07:32.786 --> 07:33.521
WITH CHE'.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.288
COME ON, BE NICE.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.557
DON'T--DON'T SAY HER NAME

07:36.557 --> 07:38.992
LIKE YOU DOWN WITH HER...

07:38.992 --> 07:39.727
I'M DOWN WITH YOU.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.694
'CAUSE THEN IT'S GONNA BE--

07:40.694 --> 07:43.163
* THE PUERTO RICAN PRINCESS

07:43.163 --> 07:44.364
STEVIE, LISTEN.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.534
I WILL APOLOGIZE TO THIS GIRL,

07:46.534 --> 07:48.101
BUT I DON'T WANT NO SHENANIGANS

07:48.101 --> 07:49.069
OUT OF YOU.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.037
AND LET ME FIND OUT

07:50.037 --> 07:51.338
YOU SMASHING HER,

07:51.338 --> 07:52.105
AND I'M GONNA SMASH

07:52.105 --> 07:53.807
YOUR [bleep] HEAD OPEN.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.042
I'M SERIOUS, STEVIE.

07:55.042 --> 07:55.909
YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR [bleep]

07:55.909 --> 07:57.044
IN YOUR PANTS.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.011
IT IS.

07:58.011 --> 07:58.979
I'M ONLY APOLOGIZING

07:58.979 --> 07:59.747
'CAUSE I WAS WRONG.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.215
BE NICE.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.116
ALL RIGHT, SEE IF WE CAN GET

08:03.116 --> 08:03.951
SOME MORE OIL RIGHT HERE.

08:03.951 --> 08:04.652
YEAH.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.553
AND WE'LL BE READY TO SHOOT.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.554
OKAY, PERFECT.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.088
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.758
LET'S DO IT.

08:10.758 --> 08:13.460

08:39.853 --> 08:41.088
THE SAME WAY I ROCK WITH HER.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.089
AND I CAN'T PLAY.

08:42.089 --> 08:42.923
AND I CAN'T BE HER FRIEND

NO MORE.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.391
[camera shutter clicking]

08:44.391 --> 08:45.593
NICE.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.260

I DON'T WANT THE SAME OLD

08:48.596 --> 08:49.329
RASHEEDA LOOK.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.598
BUT IF I SAY WAIT, YOU WAIT.

08:50.598 --> 08:51.464
HOW LONG YOU WANT TO WAIT,

08:51.464 --> 08:53.466
TILL I'M A [bleep] WHALE?

09:03.243 --> 09:03.944
HELLO.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.145
[laughter]

09:05.145 --> 09:06.313
GODDAMN.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.881
HI, FIRECRACKER.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.849
WHAT UP, BABY?

09:08.849 --> 09:10.117
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK

09:10.117 --> 09:11.685
IN THE "A" AFTER ALL THE DRAMA

09:11.685 --> 09:12.620
UP NORTH.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.921
BUT IT'S BUSINESS FIRST.

09:13.921 --> 09:14.955
AND I REALLY NEED TO SIT DOWN

09:14.955 --> 09:17.124
WITH K. BECAUSE SHE GOT PHYSICAL

09:17.124 --> 09:18.291
WITH MY FRIEND

09:18.291 --> 09:19.660
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM,

09:19.660 --> 09:21.161
SO I REALLY WANTED TO STRAIGHTEN

09:21.161 --> 09:21.995
THIS [bleep] OUT.

09:21.995 --> 09:22.963
OKAY, WHAT WE GONNA DO?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.297
WE GONNA HAVE A REAL TALK.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.033
I KNEW YOU CARED.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.367
SO FOR THAT TO HAPPEN...

09:27.367 --> 09:28.035
YEAH.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.302
IT WAS LIKE,

09:29.302 --> 09:30.203
"I'M SORRY, WHAT?"

09:30.203 --> 09:31.204
LET ME JUST SAY THIS

09:31.204 --> 09:33.006
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.842
NEVER BRING SOMEONE

09:34.842 --> 09:36.877
TO MY PLACE WHERE I'M DOING

09:36.877 --> 09:37.911
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.113
NOTHING WAS GOING TO BE SOLVED

09:40.113 --> 09:41.548
THAT NIGHT WITH ME AND MIMI,

09:41.548 --> 09:42.515
PERIOD.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.084
AND I'M ALWAYS SO WORRIED

09:44.084 --> 09:45.953
ABOUT IF MIMI GOOD, MIMI GOOD.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.054
THAT WAS MY ONE NIGHT

09:47.054 --> 09:47.888
TO BE SELFISH.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.022
I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS

09:49.022 --> 09:50.290
COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT

09:50.290 --> 09:51.659
IN A MANNER TO WHERE--

09:51.659 --> 09:52.893
IT WASN'T THE TIME.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.127
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HOW MIMI

09:54.127 --> 09:54.895
WAS FEELING.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.229
I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT--

09:56.229 --> 09:57.130
WELL, DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU

09:57.130 --> 09:57.998
OWE HER AN APOLOGY FOR--

09:57.998 --> 09:59.733
I DON'T OWE HER [bleep].

09:59.733 --> 10:00.668
K., YOU SAID A LOT

10:00.668 --> 10:01.268
OF MEAN THINGS TOO.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.736
I DON'T CARE.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.204
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE SHOWED UP.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.106
BUT IF I REALLY WANTED TO FIGHT,

10:06.106 --> 10:07.007
I JUST WOULD'VE FOUGHT.

10:07.007 --> 10:07.675
NO.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.508
I BOPPED HER

10:08.508 --> 10:09.176
WITH THE FLOWERS,

10:09.176 --> 10:09.877
'CAUSE THAT WAS LIKE

10:09.877 --> 10:11.111
A "BITCH, WAKE UP" SLAP.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.012
"BITCH, STOP BEING

10:12.012 --> 10:12.746
[bleep] DRUNK.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.247
BITCH, THIS MAN IS USING YOU.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.582
BITCH, THIS WHAT IT IS."

10:15.582 --> 10:16.283
NO, NO.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.417
I'M REAL BIG ON RUN UP,

10:17.417 --> 10:18.118
GET DONE UP,

10:18.118 --> 10:19.286
TALK [bleep] TO GET HIT.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.888
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.

10:20.888 --> 10:21.955
K.MICHELLE ISN'T THE TYPE

10:21.955 --> 10:23.423
OF PERSON TO LET ANYONE

10:23.423 --> 10:24.658
DO ANYTHING TO HER,

10:24.658 --> 10:26.559
SO IF MIMI WANTS TO COME FOR ME,

10:26.559 --> 10:27.761
THEN I'MA COME FOR HER.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.461
IF SHE STARTS IT,

10:28.461 --> 10:29.529
I FINISH IT.

10:29.529 --> 10:30.530
SHE DON'T ROCK WITH ME

10:30.530 --> 10:31.732
THE SAME WAY I ROCK WITH HER.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.766
AND I CAN'T PLAY.

10:32.766 --> 10:33.533
AND I CAN'T BE HER FRIEND

10:33.533 --> 10:34.234
NO MORE.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.102
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU

10:35.102 --> 10:35.969
COULD'VE JUST HANDLED THAT

10:35.969 --> 10:36.670
DIFFERENTLY?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.405
NO, BECAUSE--WHY--THIS WHY--

10:38.405 --> 10:40.207
WITH HER, NOT NIKKO.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.041
WITH HER.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.075
DID I EVER TAKE A SHOT

10:42.075 --> 10:43.043
AT MIMI UNTIL SHE

10:43.043 --> 10:43.711
SAID SOMETHING?

10:43.711 --> 10:45.078
SHE TOOK DIRECT SHOTS AT ME.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.479
I WAS TALKING ABOUT NIKKO.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.214
YOU DIDN'T SAY

10:47.214 --> 10:47.915
ANYTHING BAD...

10:47.915 --> 10:49.382
[together] ABOUT HER.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.317
I WOULD NEVER DO HER

10:50.317 --> 10:51.018
LIKE THAT.

10:51.018 --> 10:51.752
BUT THAT'S SOMEBODY

10:51.752 --> 10:53.086
THAT SHE'S SLEEPING WITH.

10:53.086 --> 10:53.787
SLEEPING WITH?

10:53.787 --> 10:54.855
YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY "LOVE."

10:54.855 --> 10:55.756
DO YOU THINK SHE LOVE HIM?

10:55.756 --> 10:56.824
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.225
FIRST SHE GO FROM STEVIE.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.526
NOW SHE ON HIS BUS.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.128
NOW SHE ON THE PINK BUS.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.797
AND MY BELIEF IS THAT THIS MAN

11:03.797 --> 11:04.564
IS NOT RIGHT.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.265
I JUST WANT EVERYBODY

11:05.265 --> 11:06.099
TO GET ALONG.

11:06.099 --> 11:06.767
NO, WE GOOD.

11:06.767 --> 11:07.500
[growls]

11:07.500 --> 11:08.235
WE GOOD.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.369
I AIN'T GOT NO PROBLEM WITH HER.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.303
I WANT HER TO BE HAPPY.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.172
I HOPE THE BOY DO RIGHT.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.306
BUT I THANK YOU

11:13.306 --> 11:14.474
FOR BEING AT THAT SHOW,

11:14.474 --> 11:15.575
FOR BEING ABLE TO SHARE

11:15.575 --> 11:16.744
THAT MOMENT WITH ME.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.545
THAT--THAT MEANT A LOT TO FAMILY

11:18.545 --> 11:20.413
AND SUPPORTERS.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.648
YOU DID GREAT.

11:21.648 --> 11:22.649
I WILL SAY THAT.

11:22.649 --> 11:23.751
I DON'T KNOW WHY ME AND YOU

11:23.751 --> 11:24.918
CAN ALWAYS HAVE A CONVERSATION.

11:24.918 --> 11:25.786
YOU ARE THE ONE PERSON

11:25.786 --> 11:26.754
I CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.756
[laughs]

11:36.096 --> 11:37.064
I REALLY DIDN'T GET A CHANCE

11:37.064 --> 11:37.765
TO TALK TO ERICA

11:37.765 --> 11:38.665
AT THE FASHION SHOW,

11:38.665 --> 11:40.400
SO I INVITED HER ON A PLAYDATE.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.168
OUR KIDS ARE AROUND

11:41.168 --> 11:41.902
THE SAME AGE,

11:41.902 --> 11:42.770
AND SHE'S ANOTHER MOTHER

11:42.770 --> 11:44.204
I CAN TALK TO, SO THIS IS

11:44.204 --> 11:45.038
A GREAT CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW

11:45.038 --> 11:45.773
HER BETTER.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.107
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

11:47.107 --> 11:47.908
WORKING.

11:47.908 --> 11:48.641
THAT'S IT, WORKING.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.309
SAME HERE.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.110
I HEARD YOU WAS OPENING

11:50.110 --> 11:50.811
A STORE.

11:50.811 --> 11:53.213
YEAH, MYSELF AND MY SON'S

11:53.213 --> 11:54.815
FATHER, BIG DREW, WERE GONNA

11:54.815 --> 11:55.949
OPEN A SNEAKER STORE TOGETHER,

11:55.949 --> 11:57.785
BUT IT WENT TO THE LEFT,

11:57.785 --> 11:58.451
THE RIGHT.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.087
IT WENT UPSIDE DOWN, INSIDE OUT.

12:00.087 --> 12:00.888
YOU KNOW WHAT, [bleep]...

12:00.888 --> 12:01.554
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.390
LIKE, ONE OF THE PARTNERS...

12:03.390 --> 12:04.324
UH-HUH.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.127
ENDED UP BEING A CON ARTIST.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.195
YEAH, SO WE'RE DOING

12:08.195 --> 12:08.896
WHAT WE GOT TO DO

12:08.896 --> 12:09.696
TO GET THE MONEY BACK,

12:09.696 --> 12:10.597
BUT IT'S STILL HARD.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.531
AND I WAS HOPING THE STORE

12:11.531 --> 12:12.365
WOULD OPEN TO KEEP HIM HERE...

12:12.365 --> 12:13.066
MM-HMM.

12:13.066 --> 12:13.801
SO HE DIDN'T HAVE

12:13.801 --> 12:14.434
TO GO BACK ON TOUR.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.803
HE CAN, YOU KNOW, BE A DAD

12:15.803 --> 12:17.037
AND HELP ME OUT MORE.

12:17.037 --> 12:17.805
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS,

12:17.805 --> 12:18.571
KIND OF LIKE BEING A SINGLE--

12:18.571 --> 12:19.672
I FEEL LIKE A SINGLE MOTHER.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.208
'CAUSE HE'S NOT HERE.

12:21.208 --> 12:21.875
YEAH.

12:21.875 --> 12:22.542
SO WITH THE STORE

12:22.542 --> 12:24.144

12:24.144 --> 12:24.978
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO GO BACK

12:24.978 --> 12:25.946
ON THE ROAD.

12:25.946 --> 12:26.613
WHO DO I TURN TO?

12:26.613 --> 12:27.347
I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.015
I DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.182
LIKE, WHO DO YOU--

12:29.182 --> 12:29.917

12:29.917 --> 12:30.818

12:34.922 --> 12:36.423
NO, WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.257
Y'ALL WAS ENGAGED.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.326
YEAH, WE WERE ENGAGED.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.861
THE ENGAGEMENT'S OFF.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.029
AT THIS POINT, WE'RE JUST REALLY

12:42.029 --> 12:43.964
JUST TRYING TO BE FRIENDS

12:43.964 --> 12:46.033
AND JUST BE AT PEACE, YOU KNOW.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.635
I CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND

12:48.635 --> 12:49.602

12:53.640 --> 12:54.842
'CAUSE I'M IN THAT SAME

12:54.842 --> 12:55.876
SITUATION.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.277
DREW PISSES ME OFF

12:57.277 --> 12:58.311
ON A REGULAR BASIS,

12:58.311 --> 12:59.212
SO I GET IT.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.914
IT'S FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.082
HIM--WITH HIM LEAVING,

13:02.082 --> 13:03.283
THAT'S GONNA BE FRUSTRATING.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.117
GROUPIE [bleep]--

13:04.117 --> 13:05.252

13:20.633 --> 13:22.102
I KNOW THAT SHE DATED HIM

13:22.102 --> 13:23.670
OFF AND ON.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.872
I DON'T REALLY...

13:24.872 --> 13:26.506
MY ISSUE WITH HER IS,

13:26.506 --> 13:27.540
"YOU KNEW THE WHOLE TIME

13:27.540 --> 13:28.208
ABOUT ME.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.376

16:49.409 --> 16:50.510
BE A BETTER HUSBAND.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.211
BE SUPPORTIVE.

16:51.211 --> 16:51.944
I DON'T WANT TO BE

16:51.944 --> 16:53.513
A [bleep] HUSBAND RIGHT NOW.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.247
OH, YOU DON'T?

16:54.247 --> 16:55.348

WELL, THEN GET

16:56.083 --> 16:57.150

16:57.150 --> 16:58.251
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

16:58.251 --> 16:59.786
BECAUSE YOU'RE WRITING MONEY

16:59.786 --> 17:00.620

17:00.620 --> 17:02.089
IT DON'T MATTER.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.398

17:11.398 --> 17:12.599
THESE INCIDENTS

17:12.599 --> 17:14.667
ARE DIMINISHING YOUR BRAND.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.568
I DON'T WANT TO LET

17:15.568 --> 17:16.469

17:16.469 --> 17:18.271
I DON'T WANT TO LET THEM DOWN.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.128

17:42.129 --> 17:42.929
OKAY.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.231
I MADE ME SOME LOBSTER

17:44.231 --> 17:45.432
AND SOME SHRIMP.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.566
YOU WEREN'T WATCHING NO PORN?

17:46.566 --> 17:47.267
I'M JUST KIDDING.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.135
NAH, I WASN'T WATCHING--

17:48.135 --> 17:49.502

17:49.502 --> 17:51.338
I DON'T WATCH PORN BY MYSELF.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.539
YOU BETTER NOT BE.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.441
AS BAD AS I MAY BE SOMETIMES,

17:54.441 --> 17:55.508
I WAS WRONG FOR PUTTING MY HANDS

17:55.508 --> 17:56.376
ON CHE' MACK.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.744
AS LONG AS STEVIE

17:57.744 --> 17:59.045
DON'T WORK WITH CHE' MACK

17:59.045 --> 18:00.647
BEFORE FINISHING MY [bleep],

18:00.647 --> 18:01.548
I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE

18:01.548 --> 18:03.416

18:14.827 --> 18:15.595
WHEN I'M WRONG,

18:15.595 --> 18:16.329
I'M GONNA SAY I'M WRONG.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.530
AND I'M SORRY FOR DOING THAT,

18:17.530 --> 18:18.431
'CAUSE I SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.266
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

18:19.266 --> 18:20.066
I DON'T WANT NOBODY

18:20.066 --> 18:21.301
PUTTING THEIR HANDS ON ME.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.702
SO I APOLOGIZE FOR DOING THAT.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.403
THAT WAS MY BAD.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.171
I'M SORRY.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.037
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DID THAT.

18:25.037 --> 18:25.772

18:25.772 --> 18:26.673

18:26.673 --> 18:28.040

18:28.040 --> 18:29.176
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU WORK

18:29.176 --> 18:30.177
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

18:30.177 --> 18:30.877
Y'ALL GOING TO WORK

18:30.877 --> 18:31.544
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.345
LISTEN, TRUST ME.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.079
I DON'T MIND HIM WORKING

18:33.079 --> 18:33.780

18:33.780 --> 18:35.182
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

18:35.182 --> 18:36.383
THAT'S HOW HE MAKE HIS MONEY.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.185
MY THING WITH HIM WAS THAT

18:38.185 --> 18:38.985
"YOU FINISH WITH ME FIRST."

18:38.985 --> 18:39.652
DON'T I TELL YOU THIS

18:39.652 --> 18:40.320
ALL THE TIME?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.188
THAT'S WHAT BASICALLY

18:41.188 --> 18:41.821
I WAS TELLING TO HER.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.556

18:46.959 --> 18:48.961
IT'S LIKE LA COSA NOSTRA

18:48.961 --> 18:49.896
THING OF OURS.

18:49.896 --> 18:50.763
AND IF I CAN'T WORK WITH HIM

18:50.763 --> 18:51.431
BECAUSE OF YOU,

18:51.431 --> 18:52.799
THEN IT'S ALL LOVE.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.933
IT'S RESPECT, BUT I'M GONNA KEEP

18:53.933 --> 18:54.767
ON DOING WHAT I'M DOING.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.669
AND HOPEFULLY, Y'ALL COME AROUND

18:56.669 --> 18:57.770
AND SAY, "ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.905
LET'S [bleep] WITH HER ONE TIME.

18:58.905 --> 18:59.639
LET'S DO A SONG WITH HER.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.307
[bleep] IT."

19:00.307 --> 19:01.808
CAN WE MOVE PAST THIS?

19:01.808 --> 19:02.842
ASK HER. DON'T ASK ME.

19:02.842 --> 19:03.576
LISTEN.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.811
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.513
I'M LISTENING, CHE'.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.114
IF I WAS MESSING WITH HIM,

19:08.114 --> 19:09.216
I WOULD NOT BE AROUND.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.049
BUT WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING

19:18.325 --> 19:19.626

19:24.631 --> 19:25.332
OH, OKAY.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.033

20:11.744 --> 20:12.412

20:12.412 --> 20:13.680

20:13.680 --> 20:14.381
HI, LADIES.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.282

20:18.885 --> 20:20.453
I'VE BEEN TO PSYCHICS BEFORE.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.688
AND WHEN ERICA TOLD ME

20:21.688 --> 20:22.422
ABOUT THIS PRIESTESS

20:22.422 --> 20:23.390
THAT SHE KNEW ABOUT,

20:23.390 --> 20:24.657
I FIGURE, "WHAT THE HELL,

20:24.657 --> 20:25.525
LET'S GO SEE."

20:25.525 --> 20:26.993
I GOT A LOT OF STUFF

20:26.993 --> 20:27.794
GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

20:27.794 --> 20:28.961
MAYBE THIS LADY COULD GIVE ME

20:28.961 --> 20:30.963
A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.702
IN YOUR HOUSE OF FRIENDS

20:35.702 --> 20:37.103
AND FAMILY, IT'S TALKING ABOUT

20:37.103 --> 20:39.238
YOU MOVING, CHANGING YOUR JOB

20:39.238 --> 20:43.276
OR CHANGING YOUR RESIDENCE.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.577
BEFORE, YOU WAS TALKING ABOUT

20:44.577 --> 20:45.778
A LOVE AFFAIR THAT YOU MAY BE

20:45.778 --> 20:47.213
CONCERNED WITH.

20:47.213 --> 20:47.880
DO YOU KNOW WHAT

20:47.880 --> 20:50.750
I'M SPEAKING OF?

20:50.750 --> 20:51.451
YES.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.753
OKAY, SO SHE GOT ME.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.754
I DID JUST MOVE

20:54.754 --> 20:55.955
INTO MY NEW PLACE.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.524
BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BUSINESS,

20:57.524 --> 20:58.791
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.493
I'VE HAD MY DOUBTS

21:00.493 --> 21:01.928
ABOUT NIKKO A LITTLE BIT.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.396
I HAD MY EYEBROW RAISED,

21:03.396 --> 21:04.764
BUT I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE

21:04.764 --> 21:06.533
ABOUT IT, SO THERE'S NO WAY

21:06.533 --> 21:07.367
THIS LADY COULD KNOW.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.134
AND THE OUTCOME

21:08.134 --> 21:08.935
OF THE READING SAYS THAT

21:08.935 --> 21:10.136
YOU'RE TRYING TO REBUILD

21:10.136 --> 21:11.203
AN OLD RELATIONSHIP

21:11.203 --> 21:12.539
BUT IN A NEW WAY

21:12.539 --> 21:13.873
OR SOMEONE FROM THE PAST

21:13.873 --> 21:15.808
HAS RETURNED TO YOU.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.344
THIS IS A FOOLISH DECISION.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.045
[coughs]

21:19.045 --> 21:19.746
DO YOU KNOW WHAT

21:19.746 --> 21:22.349
I'M SPEAKING OF?

21:22.349 --> 21:25.985
[laughter]

21:25.985 --> 21:27.720
I SAT AND LOOKED THAT WAY.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.088
OH, MY GOSH.

21:29.088 --> 21:29.789
PHEW.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.457
YES.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.458
YES?

21:31.458 --> 21:33.360
CLEARLY.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.461
AND IT ALSO SAYS HERE

21:34.461 --> 21:35.227
THAT THIS SITUATION

21:35.227 --> 21:36.162
IS OVER FOR YOU.

21:36.162 --> 21:36.963
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET

21:36.963 --> 21:38.431
ANY FURTHER WITH IT.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.599
LET IT GO.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.467
OKAY, I'M A LITTLE

21:40.467 --> 21:41.434
UNCOMFORTABLE.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.770
[snickering]

21:43.770 --> 21:45.805
I AM READY, GOODNESS.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.940
I WANT TO ASK ABOUT

21:47.940 --> 21:49.476
MY FRIENDSHIPS.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.210
ANY PARTICULAR FRIENDS

21:51.210 --> 21:52.879
IN PARTICULAR OR JUST OVERALL?

21:52.879 --> 21:55.047
YES, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK

21:55.047 --> 21:56.248
ABOUT A GIRLFRIEND

21:56.248 --> 21:58.017
NAMED K.MICHELLE.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.185
K.MICHELLE,

21:59.185 --> 22:02.021
IN HER HEART,

22:02.021 --> 22:06.225
DOES NOT...

22:06.225 --> 22:07.394
CARE FOR YOU,

22:07.394 --> 22:09.662
ALTHOUGH,

22:09.662 --> 22:14.534
SHE ACTS EXTREMELY

22:14.534 --> 22:16.569
FRIENDLY, PERIOD.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.772
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

22:19.772 --> 22:20.440
ALL DAY.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.474
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

22:21.474 --> 22:23.910
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.545
SHE HIT A COUPLE OF HOME RUNS

22:25.545 --> 22:26.413
SO FAR.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.014
K.MICHELLE, SHE HASN'T BEEN

22:28.014 --> 22:29.015
ACTING TOO FRIENDLY WITH ME

22:29.015 --> 22:31.451
LATELY, BUT NIKKO?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.420
THIS IS REALLY FREAKING ME OUT.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.320
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

22:34.320 --> 22:35.321
MM-MM.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.923
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELVES.

22:36.923 --> 22:37.890
THANK YOU.

22:37.890 --> 22:38.825
IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

22:38.825 --> 22:39.992
ALL RIGHT.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.294
THANK YOU.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.296
OOH, GIRL.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.704
I AM SO EXCITED.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.005
I'M ON CLOUD NINE.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.907
I'VE SOLD OUT TWO SHOWS

22:54.907 --> 22:56.643
IN ONE WEEK WITH NO ALBUM,

22:56.643 --> 22:58.010
NO SINGLE.

22:58.010 --> 22:58.678
HELLO.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.345
YOU MADE IT.

22:59.345 --> 23:00.012
WHAT UP?

23:00.012 --> 23:01.448
AND MY A&R, ALASKA,

23:01.448 --> 23:03.149
CALLED ME IN BECAUSE IT'S TIME

23:03.149 --> 23:03.850
FOR US TO TALK ABOUT

23:03.850 --> 23:05.818
THE NEXT STEPS IN MY JOURNEY.

23:05.818 --> 23:06.586
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING?

23:06.586 --> 23:08.788
SO YOU KNOW,

23:08.788 --> 23:10.056
THE PROJECT'S COMING OUT,

23:10.056 --> 23:10.723
WANT TO MAKE SURE

23:10.723 --> 23:11.858
WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE MUSIC.

23:11.858 --> 23:12.525
ALL RIGHTY.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.225
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

23:13.225 --> 23:14.661
YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING ON TWITTER

23:14.661 --> 23:15.462
AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT

23:15.462 --> 23:17.096
FOCUSING ON BEEFING WITH PEOPLE.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.998
SO WE JUST WANT TO HAVE

23:18.998 --> 23:19.699
A LITTLE CONVERSATION

23:19.699 --> 23:21.100
TO SET THINGS UP.

23:21.100 --> 23:21.868
OKAY.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.002
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS YOUR

23:23.002 --> 23:24.737
PERCEPTION IN THE MEDIA OVERALL,

23:24.737 --> 23:25.538
THE DOMINANT PERCEPTION

23:25.538 --> 23:26.205
OF K.MICHELLE?

23:26.205 --> 23:26.873
I THINK PEOPLE THINK

23:26.873 --> 23:28.775
THAT I'M CRAZY.

23:28.775 --> 23:29.742
I THINK PEOPLE THINK

23:29.742 --> 23:30.877
THAT I'M A FIRECRACKER.

23:30.877 --> 23:31.644
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

23:31.644 --> 23:32.879
YEAH.

23:32.879 --> 23:33.613
[chuckles]

23:33.613 --> 23:34.481
SO MUCH OF IT

23:34.481 --> 23:35.081
IS NEGATIVE, THOUGH.

23:35.081 --> 23:35.748
I DON'T CARE.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.516
YOU DON'T CARE?

23:36.516 --> 23:37.717
'CAUSE I KNOW WHO I AM.

23:37.717 --> 23:38.751
I DON'T CARE.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.520
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MUSIC?

23:40.520 --> 23:42.154
MY MUSIC IS AMAZING.

23:42.154 --> 23:42.922
THAT WE KNOW.

23:42.922 --> 23:43.756
YOU'RE A GREAT SINGER,

23:43.756 --> 23:45.391
A TALENTED SONGWRITER.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.726
YOU HAVE A NEW LABEL

23:46.726 --> 23:48.127
SITUATION AT ATLANTIC.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.562
YOU HAVE A NEW MANAGER.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.497
YOU HAVE A LOT OF NEW

23:50.497 --> 23:52.532
SITUATIONS, BUT...

23:52.532 --> 23:53.399
THE SAME ATTITUDE.

23:53.399 --> 23:54.200
ATTITUDE.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.067
EVERYONE'S ALWAYS CHECKING

23:55.067 --> 23:56.402
OUT WHAT'S THE LATEST GOSSIP,

23:56.402 --> 23:57.236
WHAT'S THE LATEST BEEF.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.271
AND YOU AS A ARTIST, AS MUCH

23:59.271 --> 24:00.006
AS YOU SAY YOU DON'T CARE,

24:00.006 --> 24:00.973
I KNOW YOU WANT PEOPLE

24:00.973 --> 24:01.874
TO CARE ABOUT YOUR MUSIC.

24:01.874 --> 24:02.575
THEY DO.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.143
THAT'S WHY I SELL OUT SHOWS.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.845
OKAY, BUT SELLING OUT SHOWS

24:05.845 --> 24:07.780
AND SELLING--YOU HAVE A SINGLE--

24:07.780 --> 24:08.881
THEY'RE NOT COMING TO SEE ME

24:08.881 --> 24:09.882
HIT NOBODY ONSTAGE.

24:09.882 --> 24:10.783
THEY COME TO HEAR ME SING.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.619
OKAY, THESE INCIDENTS

24:12.619 --> 24:14.954
ARE DIMINISHING YOUR BRAND.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.556
AND INSTEAD OF PEOPLE FOCUSING

24:16.556 --> 24:17.757
ON YOU, THE TALENT,

24:17.757 --> 24:19.759
ALL OF THAT IS BEING SUPPRESSED

24:19.759 --> 24:21.360
BY ALL OF THIS MESS.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.228
I WANT THEM TO SEE

24:22.228 --> 24:23.530
THE CARING WOMAN

24:23.530 --> 24:24.931
WHO WANTS TO BE THE GOOD FRIEND,

24:24.931 --> 24:26.533
WHO WANTS TO BE THE CONFIDANT,

24:26.533 --> 24:27.800
WHO WANTS TO BE THE SUPPORTER.

24:27.800 --> 24:28.668
BUT IF PEOPLE GET TO SEE

24:28.668 --> 24:29.368
WHO YOU ARE AND THEY SEE

24:29.368 --> 24:30.136
THAT YOU'RE A GREAT PERSON,

24:30.136 --> 24:30.803
THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE,

24:30.803 --> 24:31.538
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:31.538 --> 24:33.540
I WANT K.MICHELLE TO WIN."

24:33.540 --> 24:34.841
I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE

24:34.841 --> 24:35.575
THE KIND OF PERSON

24:35.575 --> 24:36.543
WHO BITES THEIR TONGUE,

24:36.543 --> 24:37.844
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT ME.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.045
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

24:39.045 --> 24:40.747
IF IT HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT

24:40.747 --> 24:42.114
ON HOW PEOPLE LOOK AT ME

24:42.114 --> 24:43.550
AND THEY CAN'T PROPERLY LISTEN

24:43.550 --> 24:44.884
TO MY MUSIC RIGHT,

24:44.884 --> 24:45.952
THEN THERE'S SOME CHANGES

24:45.952 --> 24:46.886
I NEED TO MAKE.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.087
I JUST WANT TO SING.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.155
THAT'S JUST IT, LIKE--

24:49.155 --> 24:50.222
WELL, DO THAT.

24:50.222 --> 24:50.890
LET'S DO IT.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.559
I JUST DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE

24:52.559 --> 24:53.960
THAT I'VE BEEN AROUND

24:53.960 --> 24:54.827
HERE IN ATLANTA

24:54.827 --> 24:57.163
ARE WHO I NEED TO BE AROUND.

24:57.163 --> 25:01.000
I GIVE EVERYBODY EVERYTHING.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.571
AND THEN WHEN YOU GIVE EVERYBODY

25:04.571 --> 25:05.705
EVERYTHING AND THEN THEY GO

25:05.705 --> 25:06.873
AND [bleep] ON YOU,

25:06.873 --> 25:10.276
I DON'T APPRECIATE IT.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.011
SO I'LL WORK ON IT.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.815
I'LL DEAL WITH TWITTER AND--

25:15.815 --> 25:16.716
AND ALL OF THAT

25:16.716 --> 25:17.717
OR WHATEVER IT NEEDS TO BE,

25:17.717 --> 25:18.951
'CAUSE I DO WANT MY MUSIC.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.352
I DON'T WANT TO LET THE PEOPLE

25:20.352 --> 25:21.588
WHO ACTUALLY HAVE MY BACK,

25:21.588 --> 25:22.388
MY FANS OUT THERE--

25:22.388 --> 25:24.123
I DON'T WANT TO LET THEM DOWN.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.491
AND I BELIEVE THEY WANT YOU

25:25.491 --> 25:27.594
TO WIN JUST LIKE WE DO,

25:27.594 --> 25:29.596
BUT IT'S TIME FOR THE CHANGE.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.263
AND I HAVE A ALBUM TO MAKE.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.498
LET'S TAKE THE CAREER.

25:32.498 --> 25:33.733
LET'S MAKE IT STRATOSPHERIC.

25:33.733 --> 25:34.601
NEXT LEVEL.

25:34.601 --> 25:35.267
WE HAVE WORK...

25:35.267 --> 25:35.935
YES.

25:35.935 --> 25:36.603
IN OUR STUDIO.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.806
YES.

25:39.806 --> 25:40.940
I JUST DON'T EVEN WANT

25:40.940 --> 25:41.741
TO DEAL WITH HIM, DAWN,

25:41.741 --> 25:43.643
'CAUSE HE'S DOING TOO MUCH.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.611
AND I'MA BREAK UP WITH HIM,

25:44.611 --> 25:45.344
AND I'MA LET HIM KNOW

25:45.344 --> 25:46.012
FOR REAL, STRAIGHT UP,

25:46.012 --> 25:47.379
"YOU GO MAKE THAT HO A STAR.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.280
I'M GONNA GO MAKE MYSELF

25:48.280 --> 25:49.148
A STAR."

25:49.148 --> 25:50.016
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME

25:50.016 --> 25:51.283
NO IDEA AT ALL THAT YOU

25:51.283 --> 25:52.752
WAS READY TO POP THE QUESTION--

25:52.752 --> 25:53.620
YES, I DID. I DID.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.254
[bleep], I GAVE YOU A IDEA.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.455
[bleep] NO, YOU DIDN'T.

25:56.455 --> 25:57.990
WE WAS JUST [bleep] SIX DAYS

25:57.990 --> 26:00.126
BEFORE YOU PROPOSED, HOMEBOY.

26:12.504 --> 26:13.172
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

26:13.172 --> 26:14.140
SINCE THE FASHION SHOW.

26:14.140 --> 26:14.841
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:14.841 --> 26:15.541
YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING

26:15.541 --> 26:16.643
AROUND THE WORLD.

26:16.643 --> 26:17.443
I'VE BEEN KIND OF GOING

26:17.443 --> 26:18.678
THROUGH IT.

26:18.678 --> 26:19.478
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW

26:19.478 --> 26:20.713
ABOUT THE BREAKUP.

26:20.713 --> 26:21.848
SCRAPPY AND ERICA,

26:21.848 --> 26:22.915
THEY NOT TOGETHER NO MORE.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.116
RIGHT.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.284
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

26:25.284 --> 26:27.119
HE COME RUNNING TO ME.

26:27.119 --> 26:27.887
THERE'S BEEN A LOT

26:27.887 --> 26:28.688
OF COMMUNICATION.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.521
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TEXTING.

26:29.521 --> 26:30.222
WHY?

26:30.222 --> 26:30.890
I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.191
JESUS.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.660
SHAY KEEPS GOING BACK

26:33.660 --> 26:35.928
TO SCRAPPY OVER AND OVER

26:35.928 --> 26:37.229
AND OVER AGAIN.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.665
I KEEP TELLING HER,

26:38.665 --> 26:40.099
"MOVE THE [bleep] ON,"

26:40.099 --> 26:41.433
BUT SHE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.301
IF SHE WOULD TAKE MY ADVICE

26:42.301 --> 26:44.336
AND MOVE ON, SHE'LL FIND SOMEONE

26:44.336 --> 26:45.437
TO PUT A RING ON IT.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.505
SCRAPPY'S NOT PUTTING

26:46.505 --> 26:47.206
A RING ON YOU, BOO.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.675
WHEN YOU GONNA REALIZE THAT?

26:48.675 --> 26:50.476
Y'ALL BEEN HANGING OUT?

26:50.476 --> 26:52.979
WE--WE--WE HUNG OUT.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.146
YOU HUNG OUT?

26:54.146 --> 26:55.782
WE--I MEAN, A COUPLE TIMES,

26:55.782 --> 26:56.482
YEAH.

26:56.482 --> 26:57.316
OHH!

26:57.316 --> 26:58.150
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

26:58.150 --> 26:59.185
I TOLD YOU THAT [bleep]

26:59.185 --> 26:59.886
WAS GONNA--

26:59.886 --> 27:00.687
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

27:00.687 --> 27:01.353
I TOLD YOU THAT

27:01.353 --> 27:02.421
WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.089
I SAID, "HE'S GONNA GET

27:03.089 --> 27:03.756
NEAR YOU.

27:03.756 --> 27:04.423
HE'S GONNA--

27:04.423 --> 27:05.758
HE KNOWS WHAT TO TOUCH.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.393
HE KNOWS--HE KNOWS YOU."

27:07.393 --> 27:08.327
I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN THE MAN

27:08.327 --> 27:10.096
FOR FIVE FREAKING YEARS, DUDE.

27:10.096 --> 27:10.763
EXACTLY.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.264
BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS,

27:12.264 --> 27:13.532
SOMETHING DONE CAME OVER ME,

27:13.532 --> 27:14.734
AND I'M SICK OF IT.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.736
PENIS-NOTIZED, HELLO.

27:16.736 --> 27:17.403
CLEARLY.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.504
[laughs]

27:18.504 --> 27:19.505
CLEARLY, 'CAUSE I--

27:19.505 --> 27:20.406
WELL, I ALREADY TOLD YOU

27:20.406 --> 27:22.574
IT WAS GONNA--I MEAN, DAMN.

27:22.574 --> 27:23.509
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT

27:23.509 --> 27:24.944
MY SITUATION WITH SCRAPPY,

27:24.944 --> 27:26.078
THE MORE I FEEL LIKE,

27:26.078 --> 27:27.213
"WHY DID I LET THIS MAN

27:27.213 --> 27:28.514
BACK IN MY HOUSE AGAIN?"

27:28.514 --> 27:29.315
AND I GOT TO PUT SOME TYPE

27:29.315 --> 27:30.516
OF STOP TO IT BEFORE I GET

27:30.516 --> 27:32.184
TOO DEEPLY INVOLVED AND GET HURT

27:32.184 --> 27:33.585
ALL OVER AGAIN.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.387
I GOT TO SOMEHOW

27:35.387 --> 27:36.956
JUST CUT IT OFF.

27:36.956 --> 27:37.724
YOU GONNA HAVE TO SHOW ME

27:37.724 --> 27:38.324
HOW TO DO IT,

27:38.324 --> 27:39.391
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW.

27:39.391 --> 27:42.428
IT'S TIME TO TALK.

27:42.428 --> 27:43.162
GET IT OUT,

27:43.162 --> 27:44.130
AND THEN YOU'RE DONE.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.497
THAT'S CLOSURE.

27:45.497 --> 27:49.601
I'M--I'M GONNA FIND A WAY

27:49.601 --> 27:50.369
TO LET GO.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.404
I DON'T KNOW.

28:00.479 --> 28:01.914
YOU KNOW, I WAS COOL

28:01.914 --> 28:03.015
WITH APOLOGIZING

28:03.015 --> 28:03.850
WITH METAL MOUTH,

28:03.850 --> 28:06.518
BUT AFTER STEVIE SAT ME UP THERE

28:06.518 --> 28:07.453
IN FRONT OF THIS BITCH

28:07.453 --> 28:09.088
AND SHE HAD THE NERVE TO TELL ME

28:09.088 --> 28:10.890
STEVIE BOUGHT HER A TV,

28:10.890 --> 28:12.759
I WAS DONE WITH HER BITCH ASS,

28:12.759 --> 28:13.793
HIS BITCH ASS,

28:13.793 --> 28:14.761
AND THEY COULD BOTH

28:14.761 --> 28:16.662
DO BITCH-ASS THINGS TOGETHER.

28:16.662 --> 28:17.463
HEY, DAWN.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.364
HEY, HEY.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.031
WHAT'S GONNA ON?

28:19.031 --> 28:19.766
OH, MY GOD,

28:19.766 --> 28:20.532
I LOVE THOSE SHOES.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.667
OH, THANK YOU.

28:21.667 --> 28:22.401
I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:22.401 --> 28:23.669
LET ME CALL MY HOMEGIRL DAWN,

28:23.669 --> 28:24.336

28:24.336 --> 28:25.004
I NEED TO VENT.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.172
I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY

28:26.172 --> 28:27.139
ABOUT ALL THE BULL[bleep]

28:27.139 --> 28:28.574
WITH STEVIE, 'CAUSE I DON'T EVEN

28:28.574 --> 28:29.776
KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.077
HOW DID THAT MEETING GO

28:31.077 --> 28:32.144
WITH LITTLE DUSTY AND...

28:32.144 --> 28:33.312
I JUST DON'T EVEN WANT

28:33.312 --> 28:34.013
TO DEAL WITH HIM, DAWN,

28:34.013 --> 28:35.815
'CAUSE HE'S DOING TOO MUCH.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.316
YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA BE COOL

28:37.316 --> 28:38.250
WITH YOU WORKING WITH ANOTHER

28:38.250 --> 28:39.018
BITCH WHEN YOU'RE NOT DONE

28:39.018 --> 28:39.685
WITH ME.

28:39.685 --> 28:40.586
YOU GOT ME MESSED UP.

28:40.586 --> 28:41.788
WHO THE HELL YOU THINK I AM?

28:41.788 --> 28:44.556
I'M NOT GONNA DELAY MY CAREER

28:44.556 --> 28:46.192
BECAUSE OF YOUR SHENANIGANS.

28:46.192 --> 28:46.893
AND, GIRL, YOU KNOW,

28:46.893 --> 28:48.694
HE GOT THE NERVE TO TELL ME

28:48.694 --> 28:49.595
HE BOUGHT HER A TV.

28:49.595 --> 28:50.496
HE FEEL BAD.

28:50.496 --> 28:51.197
HOLD UP.

28:51.197 --> 28:51.931
[chuckles]

28:51.931 --> 28:52.698
I'M LOST FOR WORDS.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.433
THEY SUPPOSED TO BE "FRIEND."

28:54.433 --> 28:55.134
THAT AIN'T [bleep]

28:55.134 --> 28:55.802
FRIENDS DO.

28:55.802 --> 28:56.502
TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS

28:56.502 --> 28:57.169
AND HANDLE BUSINESS.

28:57.169 --> 28:57.837
YOU'RE A MANAGER.

28:57.837 --> 28:58.504
BE A MANAGER

28:58.504 --> 28:59.171
AND DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO

28:59.171 --> 28:59.839
AND PRODUCE MUSIC.

28:59.839 --> 29:00.506
BUYING A BITCH A TV,

29:00.506 --> 29:01.173
AND YOU GOT KIDS.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.008
BUT YOU GOT ALL THESE KID.

29:02.008 --> 29:02.809
WHY WOULD YOU BUY THIS BITCH

29:02.809 --> 29:03.442
A TV?

29:03.442 --> 29:04.110
THAT TV COULD HAVE WENT

29:04.110 --> 29:04.811
TO YOUR KID.

29:04.811 --> 29:05.444
YEAH.

29:05.444 --> 29:06.645
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IT IS?

29:06.645 --> 29:08.815
YOU KNOW, HE CAPTAIN SAVE-A-HO,

29:08.815 --> 29:09.816
SO HE CAN SAY,

29:09.816 --> 29:11.350
"I SAVED THAT HO."

29:11.350 --> 29:12.819
AT THE SAME RATE, YOU KNOW,

29:12.819 --> 29:13.853
WE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE

29:13.853 --> 29:15.121
WE HAVE OUR [bleep] ON POINT

29:15.121 --> 29:16.055
AND DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO

29:16.055 --> 29:16.722
A.S.A.P.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.057
TRUST ME, I'M DONE WITH IT.

29:18.057 --> 29:18.958
AND I'MA BREAK UP WITH HIM,

29:18.958 --> 29:19.826
AND I'MA LET HIM KNOW

29:19.826 --> 29:20.626
FOR REAL, STRAIGHT UP,

29:20.626 --> 29:21.828
"I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH YOU.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.529
I FEEL LIKE YOU BRING--

29:23.529 --> 29:24.563
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT BEING

29:24.563 --> 29:26.498
MINDFUL OF HOW I FEEL."

29:26.498 --> 29:28.000
SO GUESS WHAT I'MA LET HIM KNOW.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.401
"YOU GO MAKE THAT HO A STAR.

29:29.401 --> 29:30.169
I'M GONNA GO MAKE MYSELF

29:30.169 --> 29:31.037
A STAR."

29:31.037 --> 29:31.737
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:31.737 --> 29:32.839
THERE'S ONLY ONE

29:32.839 --> 29:34.006
JOSELINE HERNANDEZ.

29:34.006 --> 29:34.841
STEVIE'S NOT GONNA EVER FIND

29:34.841 --> 29:36.075
NO ONE LIKE ME.

29:36.075 --> 29:36.742
I'M JUST REALLY SICK

29:36.742 --> 29:37.409
OF EVERYTHING.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.277
HE COULD REALLY FIND SOMEBODY

29:38.277 --> 29:39.478
ELSE TO GO TREAT LIKE [bleep].

29:39.478 --> 29:40.679
I DESERVE BETTER.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.648
I'M TOO DOWN OF A CHICK FOR HIM,

29:42.648 --> 29:44.683
AND I JUST WANT MORE.

29:44.683 --> 29:45.852
"FOR REAL, [bleep], PEACE OUT.

29:45.852 --> 29:46.919
GO BE WITH A NICE BITCH.

29:46.919 --> 29:47.854
BUY HER TV.

29:47.854 --> 29:48.487
DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.155
MAKE HER A STAR.

29:49.155 --> 29:49.856
SHOOT HER A VIDEO.

29:49.856 --> 29:50.522
MAKE HER A SONG.

29:50.522 --> 29:51.523
LET ME DO ME."

29:51.523 --> 29:52.191
YEAH.

29:52.191 --> 29:52.859
AND GUESS WHAT.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.994
WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AT THE TOP.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.562
BELIEVE THAT.

29:56.562 --> 29:57.363
WE'LL SEE WHICH ONE

29:57.363 --> 29:58.230
GET THERE FIRST.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.432
MAN, LIKE, IT'S OVER.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.869
IT'S OVER.

30:02.869 --> 30:04.003
I DONE SAID SORRY

30:04.003 --> 30:05.271
A BUNCH OF MOTHER[bleep] TIMES.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.005
IT'S OVER, COOL.

30:06.005 --> 30:06.805
IF YOU DON'T GIVE A [bleep]

30:06.805 --> 30:07.907
ABOUT THAT, IT'S COOL.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.141
FINE, WE SHOULD NOT HAVE

30:09.141 --> 30:10.609
NEVER HAD SEX.

30:10.609 --> 30:11.343
SHOULD'VE, WOULD'VE,

30:11.343 --> 30:12.411
COULD'VE.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.479
WHAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO,

30:13.479 --> 30:14.380
YOU'RE NOT GONNA PLAY ME.

30:14.380 --> 30:15.147
YOU NEEDED TO BE DONE

30:15.147 --> 30:15.814
WITH MY PROJECT

30:15.814 --> 30:16.515
BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO HELP

30:16.515 --> 30:17.183
ANY OTHER PROJECT.

30:17.183 --> 30:17.850
YOUR PROJECT WAS DONE

30:17.850 --> 30:19.852
BEFORE IT STARTED.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.732
SO YOU KNOW I'M TRYING

30:33.732 --> 30:37.336
TO EXPAND MY BRAND.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.804
BUT INSTEAD OF IT BEING "MAID,"

30:38.804 --> 30:40.372
AS IN, MAID THAT CLEANS,

30:40.372 --> 30:43.275
IT'S GONNA BE "MADE" M-A-D-E.

30:43.275 --> 30:43.943
SO...

30:43.943 --> 30:44.643
DOPE.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.378
I GOT SOME IDEAS OF MY OWN.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.746
SO I'M STARTING A T-SHIRT

30:47.746 --> 30:48.881
LINE CALLED MADE,

30:48.881 --> 30:49.949
SO I'M DOING A PHOTO SHOOT

30:49.949 --> 30:51.850
NEXT WEEK FOR MY NEW BRAND.

30:51.850 --> 30:52.684
AND SINCE JOSELINE

30:52.684 --> 30:53.685
LIKES TO CALL ME A MAID,

30:53.685 --> 30:55.121
I'LL BE WEARING A MAID OUTFIT

30:55.121 --> 30:56.055
IN THE SHOOT.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.524
BUT THIS IS MY IDEA, SO, NIKKO,

30:58.524 --> 30:59.725
YOU STAY IN YOUR LANE,

30:59.725 --> 31:01.227
AND I'LL STAY IN MINE.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.462
ANYBODY THAT I'VE TOLD ABOUT IT

31:03.462 --> 31:05.831
IS JUST, YOU KNOW,

31:05.831 --> 31:07.366
EXCITED ABOUT IT, SO...

31:07.366 --> 31:09.969
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE YOU.

31:09.969 --> 31:10.636
I KNOW YOU'RE SMART.

31:10.636 --> 31:11.403
YOU'RE SMART.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.204
YOU'RE A SMART PERSON.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.172
YES, I AM.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.273
I THINK I'VE BEEN COACHING

31:14.273 --> 31:15.507
YOU AND GIVING YOU--

31:15.507 --> 31:16.475
COACHING ME?

31:16.475 --> 31:17.643
COACHING YOU IN THE SENSE

31:17.643 --> 31:18.610
WHEREAS I THINK WE'VE BEEN

31:18.610 --> 31:19.278

31:19.278 --> 31:21.981
YOU--LIKE, YOUR WORDPLAY

31:21.981 --> 31:24.550
SOMETIMES IS SO [bleep] UP.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.217
REALLY?

31:25.217 --> 31:28.620
YES, LIKE I'M A CHILD.

31:28.620 --> 31:29.688
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE

31:29.688 --> 31:31.157
SENSITIVE TO SOMETHING ELSE?

31:31.157 --> 31:31.958
NO.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.793
WELL, LET ME REPHRASE.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.795
I'M SORRY IF YOU TAKING IT

31:36.795 --> 31:38.564

31:38.564 --> 31:39.498
YOU SAID A FEW THINGS

31:39.498 --> 31:40.566
YOU NEED TO TAKE BACK.

31:40.566 --> 31:41.233

IN ONE DAY, BUT IT'S--

31:44.803 --> 31:45.972
I'M WORKING ON IT.

31:45.972 --> 31:47.306
BUT MOVING FURTHER,

31:47.306 --> 31:49.108
WE'RE BUILDING,

31:49.108 --> 31:50.742
AND I'M OUT FOR YOU.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.979
AND I HOPE YOU'RE OUT FOR ME.

31:52.979 --> 31:53.879
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN RIDING

31:53.879 --> 31:56.482
ON MY TRAIN FOR THIS LONG NOW--

31:56.482 --> 31:57.549
I'VE BEEN ON YOUR TRAIN?

31:57.549 --> 31:58.250
WE'VE BEEN RIDING--

31:58.250 --> 31:59.618
LET'S NOT GO THERE

31:59.618 --> 32:01.387
WITH THE TRAINS AND THE BUSES

32:01.387 --> 32:02.188
AND THE [bleep] JETS.

32:02.188 --> 32:02.854
OKAY.

32:02.854 --> 32:03.555
WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK--

32:03.555 --> 32:04.223
WE NOT--

32:04.223 --> 32:05.057
OKAY, THAT'S A SENSITIVE--

32:05.057 --> 32:05.857
YOU NEED TO REPHRASE THAT.

32:05.857 --> 32:06.993
LISTEN, LET ME--

32:06.993 --> 32:08.160
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO REPHRASE IT.

32:08.160 --> 32:08.827
OKAY.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.229
SO WE'VE BEEN RIDING

32:10.229 --> 32:12.831
ON EACH OTHER'S TRAIN, OKAY?

32:12.831 --> 32:13.799
OKAY.

32:13.799 --> 32:14.900
SO WHEN I FIRST STARTED

32:14.900 --> 32:16.435
DATING NIKKO, IT WAS EXCITING.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.569
IT WAS FUN.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.871
BUT NOW YOU WANT TO COACH ME?

32:19.871 --> 32:22.908
LIKE, "WHOA, COME ON, MAN.

32:22.908 --> 32:23.809
GET OUT OF HERE.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.244
I DON'T NEED ANOTHER STEVIE J.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.745
TRYING TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO

32:26.745 --> 32:28.247
IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.148
I GOT THIS."

32:29.148 --> 32:31.017
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY

32:31.017 --> 32:32.018
AND ALL, BUT YOU GOT TO FINISH

32:32.018 --> 32:32.718
THIS FOOT.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.220
THIS THE LAST ONE?

32:34.220 --> 32:35.021
I WON'T PUT YOUR FOOT

32:35.021 --> 32:36.322
TO SLEEP, THOUGH.

32:36.322 --> 32:37.323
JUST DO IT.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.325
MM.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.337
OH, MY GOD, I CANNOT BELIEVE

32:51.337 --> 32:53.372
HOW I CAN'T SAY NO TO THIS MAN.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.041
SCRAPPY, COME HERE.

32:55.041 --> 32:55.874
I MADE SOME FRUIT.

32:55.874 --> 32:57.376
YOU MADE SOME FRUIT

32:57.376 --> 32:58.744
OR YOU CUT SOME FRUIT?

32:58.744 --> 32:59.845
'CAUSE IF YOU MADE THE FRUIT,

32:59.845 --> 33:01.880
THEN YOU WOULD--

33:01.880 --> 33:03.349
YOU WOULD BE A FLOWER.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.516
SCRAPPY THINKS HE CAN COME

33:04.516 --> 33:05.617
IN AND OUT OF MY LIFE,

33:05.617 --> 33:06.685
USE AND ABUSE ME

33:06.685 --> 33:07.753
AND TREAT ME LIKE GARBAGE.

33:07.753 --> 33:08.787
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

33:08.787 --> 33:10.056
IT'S NOT FAIR TO ME,

33:10.056 --> 33:10.922
AND THIS MAN,

33:10.922 --> 33:11.923
I'M NOT LETTING HIM TREAT ME

33:11.923 --> 33:13.792
LIKE A REVOLVING DOOR.

33:13.792 --> 33:14.526
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

33:14.526 --> 33:17.463
A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE SOMETIMES

33:17.463 --> 33:19.331
I GET CONFUSED

33:19.331 --> 33:20.132
ON WHERE WE STAND.

33:20.132 --> 33:20.932
WHERE DO YOU STAND

33:20.932 --> 33:21.833
WITH ERICA RIGHT NOW?

33:21.833 --> 33:23.669
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DONE,

33:23.669 --> 33:24.903
BUT, YOU KNOW...

33:24.903 --> 33:26.338
YOU'RE DONE?

33:26.338 --> 33:27.739
YEAH.

33:27.739 --> 33:28.607
YOU SURPRISED?

33:28.607 --> 33:29.341
YEAH.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.109
WHY?

33:30.109 --> 33:31.877
'CAUSE, I MEAN, ME AND HER

33:31.877 --> 33:33.179
GOT A LITTLE BOND.

33:33.179 --> 33:33.879
YOU FEEL ME?

33:33.879 --> 33:35.581
SO I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S KIND OF

33:35.581 --> 33:37.116
HARD FOR US TO STOP

33:37.116 --> 33:38.650
EVEN [bleep] WITH EACH OTHER.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.387
BUT DO WE HAVE A BOND NOW?

33:41.387 --> 33:42.354
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN--

33:42.354 --> 33:44.256
HAVE A BOND AS A FRIENDSHIP.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.192
UH-HUH, BUT IT LED INTO MORE

33:46.192 --> 33:47.093
THAN JUST A FRIENDSHIP,

33:47.093 --> 33:48.094
AND YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.095
AND THAT'S WHAT I DON'T LIKE.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.329
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU USE

33:50.329 --> 33:51.663
THE FRIEND CARD WITH ME A LOT.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.699
WE WASN'T SEXING AS NO FRIENDS.

33:53.699 --> 33:54.733
YOU KNEW THAT.

33:54.733 --> 33:55.734
FRIENDS DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE

33:55.734 --> 33:56.468
OF EACH OTHER LIKE SCRAPPY

33:56.468 --> 33:57.136
DID WITH ME.

33:57.136 --> 33:57.803
THAT'S SOME BULL.

33:57.803 --> 33:58.970
AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T GET

33:58.970 --> 33:59.905
ON BENDED KNEE, POPPING

33:59.905 --> 34:01.173
QUESTIONS TO YOUR BABY MAMA,

34:01.173 --> 34:02.541
THE SAME BABY MAMA YOU CALLED

34:02.541 --> 34:04.176
A BUM BITCH BEFORE I DID.

34:04.176 --> 34:04.976
SERIOUSLY?

34:04.976 --> 34:06.445
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME NO IDEA

34:06.445 --> 34:07.446
AT ALL THAT YOU WAS READY

34:07.446 --> 34:08.480
TO POP THE QUESTION--

34:08.480 --> 34:09.248
YES, I DID. I DID.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.250
[bleep], I GAVE YOU A IDEA.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.451
[bleep] NO, YOU DIDN'T.

34:12.451 --> 34:13.919
WE WAS JUST [bleep] SIX DAYS

34:13.919 --> 34:15.454
BEFORE YOU PROPOSED, HOMEBOY.

34:15.454 --> 34:16.122
NO, WE WASN'T.

35:10.176 --> 35:11.777
THAT'S WHEN YOU TOLD ME.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.612
