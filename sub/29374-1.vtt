- Yo, what's good?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.117
- I've been calling you.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.485
- Yeah?

10:53.486 --> 10:54.852
- Are you gonna come
to my friend's party?

10:55.255 --> 10:56.688
- I've been busy.

10:56.690 --> 10:57.055
- Oh.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.057
- Yo fellas, this is Kelsie.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.892
- [Dunphy] Hi Kelsie.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.694
- Oh, I know you.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.796
- Yo, get out.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.564
- I wanna go with you guys.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.931
- Come on, get out,
I gotta bounce.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.205
I'll holler at you
later, alright?

11:14.207 --> 11:15.206
- Okay.

11:18.945 --> 11:19.878
Bye boys.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.664
- Bye Kelsie.

11:22.665 --> 11:23.981
- Yo, I'm watching you, bitch.

11:25.252 --> 11:28.086
- Oh.
(laughing)

11:29.122 --> 11:30.221
- Would y'all shut up,
you doofy mother fuckers?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.590
- [Dunphy] Showing
us her titties.

11:31.591 --> 11:32.958
Alright, I'm gonna get excited.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.326
- Yeah I gotta bounce.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.694
Me and Jon gotta roll somewhere.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.696
- Fuck, Grady man, you
do this shit every time.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.131
We just need to bring two cars.

11:46.039 --> 11:46.971
- Yo.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.524
We gotta go check out these
bitches down the block.

11:49.525 --> 11:52.076
And then there's some bitches
across town I gotta show you.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.311
You gonna like this.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.045
Trust me.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.715
- Sure they gonna be
all up on you, man.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.483
Girls love a guy with money.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.250
- Yeah, you know what they
like more than money, right?

12:00.253 --> 12:01.252
- What?

12:01.254 --> 12:02.020
- Dick.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.988
- What the fuck, man?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.925
- What's wrong with you?

12:06.926 --> 12:08.459
- You know I was
talking to that girl.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.894
- Talking with who?

12:11.865 --> 12:12.263
Yo, bro.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.166
I know you ain't tripping
out over no bitch.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.002
Alright.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.338
I wasn't gonna say
nothing before,

12:20.340 --> 12:23.842
but she told me how
frustrated you was making her.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.794
- What?

12:25.795 --> 12:27.745
- Yeah, said she realized
she'd been dangling that ass

12:27.748 --> 12:29.398
at a gay guy for like
a month now.

12:29.399 --> 12:31.049
- Come on man,
she wasn't saying that shit.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.151
(laughing)

12:36.089 --> 12:37.989
- Yo, you kill me, Jon.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.265
(speaking in foreign language)

12:48.201 --> 12:50.101
(dogs barking)

12:50.904 --> 12:52.053
- Grady.

12:52.054 --> 12:53.203
That's dangerous, man.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.041
Wait, okay, take the animals.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.048
And you bring strangers
into my home?

13:05.786 --> 13:09.220
- Hey Dom, this is,
it's my boy Jon.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.257
- Hey, what up?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.960
- About to fuck some bitches.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.263
Kill some snitches.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.799
You know?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.334
You know?

13:26.239 --> 13:28.206
(speaking in foreign language)

13:31.211 --> 13:33.361
- What's up, Dom?

13:33.362 --> 13:35.512
- Oye, it's like 65
degrees outside.

13:35.515 --> 13:38.433
You're wearing like
three jackets.

13:38.434 --> 13:41.352
Oye, go introduce
yourself to the girls.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.257
- Come by and talk to you,
you know.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.425
- [Dom] Well just call me.
- Yeah.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.161
- Hey, I'm Jon.
(light music)

13:50.163 --> 13:50.995
- What the fuck?

13:50.997 --> 13:53.932
- You got five fingers, right?

13:53.934 --> 13:54.950
- Yeah.

13:54.951 --> 13:55.967
- And you had a phone, right?

13:55.969 --> 13:57.727
- Yeah.

13:57.728 --> 13:59.486
- So use 'em, you know.

13:59.487 --> 14:01.245
- Okay.
- Alright.

14:01.246 --> 14:03.004
- Hey, you think I could
show Jon the garage?

14:03.577 --> 14:05.944
- Oh yeah yeah, you know
where it's at.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.046
Go.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.851
- Hey, come here man,
I wanna show you something.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.455
You see what money
could get you?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.130
Come on, man.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.867
Let's go back in the house.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.108
- That balloon ass,
has that nice ass.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.177
- Yeah.
- Why wasn't she here tonight?

14:39.179 --> 14:40.345
- Shit, I don't know man.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.447
- Showing him what you got.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.865
- Oh man, you like it?

14:43.866 --> 14:45.282
- Dude, yeah, very impressive.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.384
- Good, I like that.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.453
This is my nephew, Marciel.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.921
- Hey man.
- Marciel.

14:49.923 --> 14:50.421
Say hi to my friends.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.924
- What's up, man?
- What up?

14:52.926 --> 14:56.160
- Hey, why don't you make
them one of those drinks?

14:56.329 --> 14:58.763
- Alright.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.198
- In the meantime, Grady,
me and him gonna talk.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.300
Come on.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.537
No man, she's Brazilian.
- It will be fine.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.239
- She's Brazilian, man.
- That's bullshit.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.641
Brazilian.
(intense music)

15:09.642 --> 15:11.042
What the fuck are
you doing here now?

15:11.044 --> 15:12.343
(yelling)

15:12.946 --> 15:15.013
- Hey yo, I like that shirt.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.016
That's that new shit
right there, huh?

15:18.018 --> 15:19.484
- I'll follow the rules.
(intense music)

15:21.187 --> 15:21.819
I won't say shit.

15:21.820 --> 15:22.452
- Where you get that shit?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.455
(yelling)

15:24.457 --> 15:25.990
Business for later, you two.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.459
Come on, the
females are waiting.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.461
(eerie music)

15:30.462 --> 15:31.461
- [Grady] Get off me.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.430
You know me, Dom.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.065
Dom, you know me.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.969
- I will fucking
skin your black ass,

15:37.971 --> 15:40.038
and put it all over
my white walls.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.474
- Oh my God.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.445
- Okay.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.147
Okay.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.481
Go.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.185
(light music)

16:01.127 --> 16:03.261
That's a loyal man right there.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.196
- [Grady] You got my drink?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.100
- You'll be alright after all.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.439
(steady music)

16:19.079 --> 16:20.511
- No no no, no time for that.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.512
Let's go, come on, we're late.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.497
Seriously bro.

16:22.498 --> 16:23.481
We gotta get inside, alright?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.660
Where is this guy?

16:24.661 --> 16:25.838
What does he look like?

16:25.839 --> 16:27.016
- Old ass white dude in a suit.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.388
Well there you go.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.422
Hey, Mr. Walsh.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.725
- [Mr. Walsh] Grayson.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.159
- Hey, Mr. Walsh,
what's happening?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.593
- You are due for an
appearance in court room one

16:36.596 --> 16:37.796
at the moment.

16:37.797 --> 16:38.997
- Hey hold up, hold up, hold up.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.531
Got some money for you.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.534
- Thank you.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.835
Will you need a
receipt for that?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.136
- Don't I pay you to
know what's good for me?

16:45.138 --> 16:47.705
- I will have one mailed
to your home address.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.091
Let's get inside.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.476
- Yo, an hour of this
bullshit and it's on, alright?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.125
Just in case.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.194
(upbeat hip hop music)

17:12.165 --> 17:14.132
- Get some bitches
and calm down.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.606
Hey, yo.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.109
Where the fuck is Grady, man?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.445
- Grady got locked up.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.083
- I'm gonna be sick.

17:32.084 --> 17:32.816
- He's just punking us, man.

17:32.819 --> 17:33.768
Is he hiding out here?

17:33.769 --> 17:34.718
Where is this mother fucker at?

17:34.721 --> 17:35.887
Come on.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.054
- Hey man, I'm serious.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.661
What are you guys doing?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.196
What are you doing?

17:45.198 --> 17:47.398
- Looking for cash
and product, man.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.134
- Hey, don't rifle
through his shit, man.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.469
You can't take his stuff.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.770
- Oh.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.247
- Take that off now.

17:54.248 --> 17:55.723
- Come on, he can't
be using it in jail.

17:55.724 --> 17:57.199
You know, I wanna rock
it while it's fresh.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.675
- What would Grady do to
you if he saw you right now?

18:01.714 --> 18:03.448
Hey, get up, we gotta go.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.349
I gotta take you home.
Put your jacket on.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.318
Put your jacket on.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.487
Get your shoes on, we gotta go.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.289
- Oh.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.390
I see.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.460
Jon's gonna be taking
care of everything

18:15.462 --> 18:16.594
while Grady's gone.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.196
Nice.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.165
- Just leave his
shit alone, alright?

18:21.468 --> 18:23.301
Come on, let's go.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.636
Come on.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.206
Enjoy the room.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.607
It's paid for through the week.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.375
Compliments of
your friend Grady.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.289
I'm gonna give you Grady's keys,

18:33.290 --> 18:34.734
and I think you
should stay with us

18:34.735 --> 18:36.179
'til things settle down.
(cell phone ringing)

18:36.616 --> 18:38.149
Here, count this money for me.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.588
Hello?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.158
Yeah, okay.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.625
I'll meet you at the
PND in 30 minutes.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.527
You know where that is?

18:49.529 --> 18:52.130
Alright, I'll hit you
back on this number.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.464
How much is there?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.199
- It's,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.736
like 22,000.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.140
- You know which one
of these is two-piece?

19:03.676 --> 19:05.309
- Jon, I don't know.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.278
- I'll figure it out.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.591
- [Charlie] Hey, how's Grady?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.593
- [Jon] No word yet,
but don't worry,

19:22.594 --> 19:24.594
'cause Grady told me
to take care of you,

19:24.597 --> 19:25.229
so I'm gonna take care of you.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.431
- Tell him hello
for me, will you?

19:27.433 --> 19:28.432
- Yeah, will do.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.485
- Alright, alright.

19:30.486 --> 19:32.537
These are shrimp,
these are veggies.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.473
And that is a two piece.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.609
That there is an eight ball,

19:39.179 --> 19:41.345
and this one is an onion.

19:42.248 --> 19:45.950
And this big puppy,
that is a quarter key,

19:45.952 --> 19:47.785
and it's for me.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.754
Alright.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.856
Here you go now.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.135
- See, once this is gone,

19:53.136 --> 19:54.413
I'm sticking only
to the big stuff,

19:54.414 --> 19:55.691
because I can't be
running around man.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.211
It's peddling.

19:57.212 --> 19:58.728
- You know, if you
count it in front of me,

19:58.731 --> 19:59.997
it doesn't hurt my feelings.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.264
- Hey, you don't
have to weigh it,

20:01.267 --> 20:01.933
I don't have to count it.

20:01.934 --> 20:02.600
That's the way it should be.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.736
- [Charlie] I'd drink to
that if I was drinking.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.837

20:35.735 --> 20:39.437
¶ That nigga that you
love, that nigga ¶

20:40.306 --> 20:42.373
¶ That nigga that you
need, that nigga ¶

20:42.375 --> 20:44.442
¶ Put it in the hearse when
I beat it from the back ¶

20:44.444 --> 20:45.509
(knocking on door)

20:47.747 --> 20:50.281
(singing)

20:52.785 --> 20:54.619
(laughing)

20:55.455 --> 20:57.788
(speaking in foreign language)
(gentle music)

20:58.791 --> 21:00.591
- What the fuck are
you doing here, man?

21:00.593 --> 21:01.659
- Yo.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.895
Listen, I came to talk
about some business.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.297
(shushing)

21:06.733 --> 21:08.332
- Careful what you say.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.603
Get the leaves.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.672
Get the leaves.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.574
- There are no fucking leaves.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.575
- Yeah there are leaves.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.709
Open your eyes.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.381
- See the leaves.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.850
- Alright.
- Yeah.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.657
- So listen.

21:34.727 --> 21:35.593
(shushing)

21:35.595 --> 21:37.895
Grady--
- Don't, don't.

21:37.897 --> 21:42.667
He's taking a nice vacation
from his stupidity, I know.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.552
Okay?

21:44.553 --> 21:45.769
He's got a big mouth.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.975
- I'm taking over
for him right now, all right?

21:50.977 --> 21:51.809
I'm gonna keep him in play.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.878
I'm gonna pay his lawyer fees.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.446
- You?

21:56.849 --> 21:58.683
Listen, come here.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.692
It's better for now that
he don't feel forgotten

22:07.694 --> 22:08.592
in there, okay?

22:08.594 --> 22:13.331
So I'm gonna get Marciel
to get with you, alright?

22:14.901 --> 22:16.734
- Alright, cool.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.836
- Okay, and if you owe me money,

22:19.872 --> 22:22.606
you're gonna see me long
before you hear from me.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.643
And that's not good.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.715
Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah okay.

22:30.717 --> 22:31.816
- Okay.

22:34.087 --> 22:34.885
Now get out of here,

22:34.887 --> 22:37.488
before I make you
do something stupid.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.490
Like sweep my lawn.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.968
(cell phone ringing)

22:53.473 --> 22:54.538
- Yo.

22:55.641 --> 22:56.474
What?

22:56.476 --> 22:59.610
Yo yo yo yo, I don't mess
with anything that small.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.412
I don't fuck with
users, you feel me?

23:01.414 --> 23:02.663
I only deal with play makers.

23:02.664 --> 23:03.913
Lose this fucking number.
(phone beeping)

23:03.916 --> 23:04.982
(phone ringing)

23:05.551 --> 23:05.950
Yo Charlie.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.520
- Look at you, all dressed up.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.789
- I'm blending
into the hood, yo.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.924
I'm in camouflage.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.793
I'm coming up.

23:15.795 --> 23:16.827
- Alright.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.172
- Damn.

23:28.173 --> 23:28.838
- Charlie says he'll call you.

23:28.841 --> 23:32.410
- I'm just dropping off
Charlie's favorite movie.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.516
You got nothing to say?

23:38.918 --> 23:40.451
'Cause I ain't hearing that.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.420
- [A.J.] I know what you do.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.605
- What did I do?

23:44.606 --> 23:46.556
- I said I know what you do.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.894
And if you'd listen,
what you'll never do

23:49.896 --> 23:51.529
is standing right
in front of you.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.664
Maybe you hearing that.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.638
(phone beeping)

24:08.848 --> 24:10.281
- Who's that girl?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.715
Where did she come from,
how do you know her?

24:11.716 --> 24:13.149
- I've known her
most of her life,

24:13.152 --> 24:14.852
since she was a little girl.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.553
- Some beautiful girl is
just hanging at your place,

24:16.556 --> 24:17.788
all day all night like a cat?

24:17.790 --> 24:18.823
I mean, that's her life?

24:18.825 --> 24:20.808
What's the deal with that?

24:20.809 --> 24:22.792
- She's just been having
a hard time lately,

24:22.795 --> 24:25.729
trying to steer away
from an ex-boyfriend.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.998
I'm just trying to help her out,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.867
and let her stay
with me for now.

24:30.736 --> 24:34.772
I used to be friends
with her mother.

24:35.675 --> 24:38.075
Come by tomorrow, I
have something for you.

24:38.711 --> 24:39.944
- Alright, peace.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.085
- Were you mean to my friend?

24:49.889 --> 24:50.955
What?

24:51.791 --> 24:53.023
You don't like him?

24:53.826 --> 24:54.525
- I've got a boyfriend.

24:54.527 --> 24:57.728
- You told me you were
done with that creep.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.904
(birds chirping)

25:16.015 --> 25:17.081
- [Jon] Hey.

25:18.251 --> 25:19.783
- Oh, Jonny.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.101
Hey, how you doing?

25:21.102 --> 25:22.418
- How are you feeling?

25:22.419 --> 25:23.735
You've been outside today?
It's beautiful out there.

25:23.736 --> 25:25.052
- I haven't been
outside in a long time.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.735
- Well, you really
should get out there.

25:26.736 --> 25:28.414
It's one of the nicest
days I can remember.

25:28.415 --> 25:30.093
- I haven't been out of
the house in four years.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.531
Unless you count trips
to the emergency room.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.699
Does it count when
you're unconscious?

25:36.569 --> 25:37.818
- Are you being serious?

25:37.819 --> 25:39.068
I don't know whether
or not to believe you.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.005
- No, this is my world, man.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.006
It's where I live.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.173
It's good, it's good.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.075
But my weight exceeds the limit

25:45.077 --> 25:47.044
of the imaginary elevator.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.363
Sit down.

25:49.364 --> 25:50.613
- [Jon] No, we're going outside.

25:50.616 --> 25:51.938
- No, we're not going outside.

25:51.939 --> 25:53.261
I got a book to read.
- You're going outside,

25:53.262 --> 25:54.584
Charlie, it's ridiculous.
- Jonny.

25:54.587 --> 25:55.953
- Four years?
- Will you stop?

25:55.955 --> 25:57.154
I have a book to read.

25:57.823 --> 25:59.823
No, no no no, Jonny.

26:00.927 --> 26:01.959
- What the hell are you doing?

26:02.662 --> 26:03.561
- Going out.
- Stuff.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.207
- No, he's sick.

26:05.208 --> 26:06.619
- Well, all the more
reason to go out.

26:06.620 --> 26:08.031
You know, water,
sunshine, oxygen.

26:10.703 --> 26:11.057
Everything the body needs.

26:11.058 --> 26:11.412
Ask a plant, a
plant will tell you.

26:11.413 --> 26:11.767
- He'll die.

26:11.771 --> 26:12.937
He needs his meds.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.104
(grunting)

26:14.106 --> 26:15.573
- This ain't living.

26:15.841 --> 26:16.840
You coming?

26:16.842 --> 26:17.608
- No.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.909
Bring him back up here.

26:18.911 --> 26:22.046
- I'm not getting him back
up there now, come on.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.514
Go up.
(steady instrumental music)

26:23.515 --> 26:24.981
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

26:41.133 --> 26:45.736
¶ Oh I can't believe ¶

26:45.738 --> 26:49.006
¶ I made it here alive ¶

26:49.809 --> 26:54.111
¶ But I have survived ¶

26:56.616 --> 27:01.085
¶ I've realized ¶

27:02.622 --> 27:06.156
¶ That I've arrived ¶

27:07.660 --> 27:09.026
- Hey, you were right.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.695
The wind is great.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.231
Whoa.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.634
(laughing)

27:18.270 --> 27:19.703
- You want me to take
you up to the pier?

27:20.039 --> 27:20.938
Check out some boats?

27:20.940 --> 27:26.043
- You know, I'm just gonna
sit here for a while.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.647
- Alright, cool.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.469
- I can make it back on my own.

27:35.470 --> 27:36.753
These arms could
use the exercise.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.057
- You sure?

27:40.793 --> 27:41.825
- Yeah.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.861
Yeah, I'm good.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.232
- Alright.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.700
- Yeah, you go ahead.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.237
- Holler if you need me.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.105
- Yeah.

28:08.954 --> 28:11.088
- Look, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.059
I know none of this
would've ever happened

28:15.061 --> 28:15.959
if it wasn't for you.

28:15.961 --> 28:18.829
And I can tell
you're a good person.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.166
It's just been really
hard taking care of him,

28:22.168 --> 28:23.233
so I'm sorry if I came off--

28:23.235 --> 28:24.234
- Hey, please.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.402
He looks like he's doing good.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.975
- Well Charlie has brain cancer.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.013
And it's inoperable,
so he's terminal.

28:38.718 --> 28:39.917
I just want him to be as happy,

28:39.919 --> 28:43.721
and as comfortable as
he can be, you know?

28:49.995 --> 28:51.862
- Well, he's too
busy enjoying himself

28:51.864 --> 28:53.263
to be worrying about that now.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.734
- Yeah.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.007
- He's out cold.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.013
I wish I could take
him some place good.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.417
- He keeps talking
about the Grand Canyon.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.885
- Really?

29:14.887 --> 29:16.353
Imagine if we went
there right now.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.790
He woke up and we were
parked right in front of it.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.059
- That would be everything.

29:26.031 --> 29:27.464
- If you could go
anywhere in the world,

29:27.466 --> 29:28.899
where would you go?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.303
- Bora Bora.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.006
I saw it on TV once,

29:36.008 --> 29:38.976
and there's this little
island called Toopua,

29:39.879 --> 29:41.912
and I think you can walk
around the whole island

29:41.914 --> 29:43.814
in like 20 minutes or something.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.184
Beautiful sand, beautiful water.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.189
So clean.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.223
I imagine that nothing
bad could happen there.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.194
- Sounds great.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.331
I always tell myself
I'd buy myself

30:00.332 --> 30:02.099
a ticket out of here
once I could afford one.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.736
It's funny

30:05.737 --> 30:08.138
how every time it seems to come,

30:09.108 --> 30:12.943
I can never decide
when or where to go.

30:14.113 --> 30:18.415
I just thought maybe
Miami, or San Francisco.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.919
Brazil, I don't know.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.225
- I can tell you'll end
up somewhere special.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.195
- You can?

30:31.363 --> 30:32.896
- Yeah.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.135
- You too.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.937
- Thanks.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.238
- Yeah.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.342
(steady suspenseful music)

31:06.398 --> 31:08.131
(sirens wailing)

31:18.377 --> 31:20.143
Are you fucking kidding me?

31:28.554 --> 31:30.153
- Hey, I'm here.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.956
Yeah.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.492
Are you close?

31:39.965 --> 31:44.935
Okay, bye.
(light instrumental music)

31:48.274 --> 31:49.506
- Hi.
- [A.J.] Hey.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.441
Thank you.
- Yeah.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.612
Is that why it's not
called that anymore?

31:57.449 --> 31:58.415
They don't call 'em
pocket books anymore?

31:58.416 --> 31:59.382
Watch your step,
close your eyes.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.018
- Okay.
- Keep 'em closed.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.520
Alright.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.188
Alright?

32:06.258 --> 32:08.191
Here we go, that feels right.

32:09.929 --> 32:10.561
Oh my God, alright.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.194
- [A.J.] Okay, where are we?

32:11.196 --> 32:12.329
- [Jon] Keep 'em closed.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.097
It's kinda dark in here.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.499
- [A.J.] Okay.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.335
- This way, watch your step.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.205
Come on.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.109
Here.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.245
And sit down.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.213
- This is where you live?

32:30.482 --> 32:32.399
- Yeah.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.317
- This is like the nicest
place I've ever seen.

32:35.254 --> 32:36.253
- Not bad.

32:36.255 --> 32:38.355
You know, you're the
first person to see this.

32:38.357 --> 32:41.458
Nobody else even knows
this place exists.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.196
- Oh my God, look at you.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.099
You were so adorable.

32:49.101 --> 32:49.800
- Yes, yep.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.500
- How old were you here?

32:50.502 --> 32:54.071
- I don't know,
I think I was like five.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.239
That was my first day of school.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.345
- You did it again.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.146
- What?

33:03.649 --> 33:05.248
- You showed me you.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.752
Sometimes, you drop
all that gangster talk,

33:08.754 --> 33:10.387
and you talk like you.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.126
- I, um...

33:16.695 --> 33:18.161
I got you something.

33:18.430 --> 33:19.463
- What, really?

33:19.465 --> 33:20.497
- Yeah.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.204
I don't, I just keep
thinking about you,

33:27.206 --> 33:29.439
and thinking about
how great you are,

33:30.075 --> 33:32.109
and how much I like you.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.144
And you know how you
were talking about

33:34.146 --> 33:36.079
taking some time
away for yourself?

33:36.648 --> 33:40.283
And how you try
to break the mold.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.419
- Thanks.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.189
- Anyway, here you go.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.359
- What is this?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.429
Plane tickets?

33:53.165 --> 33:54.431
To where, it doesn't say where?

33:54.433 --> 33:57.300
- Anywhere in the
world you wanna go.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.302
Any time, any place.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.038
Those are open-ended.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.607
- Oh my God, are you serious?

34:03.609 --> 34:05.326
- [Jon] Yeah.

34:05.327 --> 34:07.044
- This is so crazy,
thank you so much.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.579
- Don't worry about it,
of course.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.112
- But I can't, I seriously
can't accept this.

34:10.114 --> 34:11.181
- [Jon] What?
No, you have to. Why not?

34:11.784 --> 34:13.382
- Because this is your dream.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.518
This is what you wanted.

34:14.518 --> 34:15.652
- Well, no, you really have to,

34:15.654 --> 34:17.821
because they are non-refundable.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.590
And that one with your name
on it is non-transferrable.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.458
So they're yours.
- And the other one?

34:22.460 --> 34:27.197
- Also non-refundable, but
that one is transferrable.

34:27.199 --> 34:28.532
So you have a little
time to figure out

34:28.534 --> 34:30.100
who you want to take with you,

34:30.101 --> 34:31.667
or if you really want, you
could just use the second one

34:32.603 --> 34:34.337
for another getaway
for yourself.

34:34.672 --> 34:36.106
- This is too much.

34:36.108 --> 34:39.208
These must have
cost you a fortune.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.510
- Ah, no.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.213
- Well,

34:43.215 --> 34:46.550
I'll just have to think about
who I want to take with.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.485
- Yeah.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.636
(gates buzzing)
(steady music)

35:16.515 --> 35:17.614
(car honking)

35:25.157 --> 35:26.123
- The fuck you doing?

35:26.125 --> 35:28.225
You know you ain't
safe right now, right?

35:28.227 --> 35:30.294
- So many people came
here to pick you up.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.362
You having trouble deciding
on who to roll with?

35:32.364 --> 35:33.780
- Shut the fuck up.

35:33.781 --> 35:35.197
- You shut the fuck
up and get in the car.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.927
- Fast food now?

35:46.928 --> 35:48.511
- Won't make you fast,
might make you rich.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.285
- Mm hmm.

35:55.754 --> 35:56.753
- [Jon] What's in the bag?

36:02.261 --> 36:02.560
- No.

36:02.561 --> 36:02.860
- Come on, dig deeper.
What's in the bag?

36:02.861 --> 36:03.160
- Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

36:03.161 --> 36:03.460
What the fuck is all this?

36:03.462 --> 36:04.494
- Oh shit.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.696
- What is all this, man?
- What, what?

36:07.399 --> 36:08.532
Are you kidding me?

36:09.234 --> 36:10.300
- Yo hold on, hold on.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.601
- Come here.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.838
Now are we back on, or what?

36:14.839 --> 36:17.473
You come pick a nigga up from
jail,
fucking cocaine and money

36:17.476 --> 36:18.642
and jewelry and shit.
- [Jon] That's how I roll.

36:25.184 --> 36:25.476
- That's how you rollin'?

36:25.477 --> 36:25.769
- Are we back or not?
I wanna hear you say it.

36:25.770 --> 36:26.062
- That's how you rollin' now?

36:26.063 --> 36:26.355
- That's how I'm rollin'.

36:26.356 --> 36:26.648
- We back on.
- My man.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.652
(upbeat hip hop music)
(laughing)

36:28.654 --> 36:29.653
- Grady.

36:29.655 --> 36:30.708
- Yo.

36:30.709 --> 36:31.762
- How you been, man?

36:31.763 --> 36:32.816
- Money can buy us, my friend.

36:32.817 --> 36:33.870
- What's this area, what's this?

36:33.871 --> 36:34.924
- Man, what does it look like?
I helped Jonny boy pick 'em out.

36:34.927 --> 36:37.227
He won't take a
day off the grind,

36:37.229 --> 36:38.779
but Grady, me and you,

36:38.780 --> 36:40.330
we just go out there.
I know the best trails, man.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.599
- [Grady] Nah, nah, Jon,
we gotta hit that up.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.202
We gots to get up
on those things.

36:46.471 --> 36:47.504
- Hey, there's somebody
I want you to meet.

36:47.506 --> 36:51.274
A.J., this is Kelsie and
Grady, my good friends.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.211
Yo, be polite.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.880
Hey, hey hey hey hey.
What the hell is this?

36:56.882 --> 36:58.549
No no, get this
shit out of here.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.217
I don't like any of this shit.
Get it out now.

37:00.352 --> 37:01.585
- Yo.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.652
- Hey.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.322
- Jonno.
- Yo.

37:05.324 --> 37:06.356
Boy man.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.758
- Yo, we need to talk.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.260
- Alright talk.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.112
- Can I holler at my man
in private for a second?

37:12.113 --> 37:13.963
- No man, we're
all friends here.

37:13.966 --> 37:14.564
It's all good.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.533
- What's up with
you and that girl?

37:16.535 --> 37:18.501
- A.J.?
She's my girl.

37:18.503 --> 37:20.670
- How long you been seeing her?

37:21.506 --> 37:22.639
- What?

37:23.575 --> 37:24.774
Oh, shit.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.677
What, you already hit
that or something?

37:27.679 --> 37:28.923
Is that what this is about?

37:28.924 --> 37:30.168
- Hell fucking no,
man, I'm serious.

37:30.169 --> 37:31.413
That bitch is a fiend.

37:31.917 --> 37:32.682
- [Jon] What?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.440
- Look, she might look good now,

37:34.441 --> 37:36.197
but a couple months ago,

37:36.198 --> 37:37.954
she was looking like fucking
Tales From The Crypt.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.314
- Alright, that's enough.
- Don't leave her in your house,
man.

37:39.315 --> 37:40.673
- That's enough.
- Where's she at right now?

37:40.674 --> 37:42.032
- Enough, alright?

37:42.033 --> 37:43.391
- Yo, you know I ain't
gonna hold my tongue.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.445
You want me to get
rid of her for you? I will.

37:45.446 --> 37:47.496
- No, wait, hey, hey.
- Where the fuck is she now?

37:50.602 --> 37:51.468
- Cristal, baby.

37:51.470 --> 37:54.537
- [Woman] One, two, three.
(camera shutter clicking)

37:54.539 --> 37:57.874
- Oh, it's such a
pretty picture.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.676
You guys look so great.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.746
Well, I got your cheers for you.

38:02.914 --> 38:03.813
To Jon.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.582
Fuck you, Jon.

38:05.884 --> 38:06.816
Fuck all you guys.

38:06.818 --> 38:10.720
That's what I got to
say to you, fuck you.

38:11.323 --> 38:11.721
You like that?

38:11.723 --> 38:13.640
Fuck you.
(glass shattering)

38:13.641 --> 38:15.558
Oh, by the way, I stole
these glasses from you.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.760
I'm fucking taking 'em.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.329
Fucking piece of shit.

38:21.667 --> 38:22.966
- Now it's a party, huh?

38:22.968 --> 38:24.467
Let's turn this shit up, huh?

38:24.469 --> 38:27.304
Come on.
(upbeat hip hop music)

38:42.721 --> 38:43.820
A.J.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.327
- Hey.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.597
- You disappeared.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.335
- Just felt like being alone.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.605
- Feeling like
being alone, huh?

39:03.342 --> 39:04.708
At her own party?

39:07.045 --> 39:08.411
Everything okay?

39:08.413 --> 39:09.412
- Yeah.

39:12.084 --> 39:13.300
The party's great.

39:13.301 --> 39:14.517
I just can't be in the
same room as that guy.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.754
How does someone like
you even know him?

39:18.623 --> 39:19.723
- Grady?

39:20.125 --> 39:23.426
I mean, we grew up together.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.765
- Just please don't believe
whatever he said about me.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.436
- You don't have to worry
about what Grady says, alright?

39:34.106 --> 39:36.673
Besides, Charlie already
told me all about you,

39:36.675 --> 39:37.907
and why you stay there.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.611
- Yeah, I take care of him.

39:44.383 --> 39:44.814
- You sure about that?

39:44.816 --> 39:46.399
It's not the other way around?

39:46.400 --> 39:47.983
'Cause I heard it was
the other way around.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.587
I heard he takes care of you.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.623
- I've always taken care of him.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.925
- Is it true you
got an ex-boyfriend

39:55.927 --> 39:57.660
who won't take fuck off
for an answer?

39:59.131 --> 40:00.364
- It's not like that.

40:00.365 --> 40:01.598
- [Jon] How is it like, then?

40:02.401 --> 40:03.433
- He's not that kinda guy.

40:03.435 --> 40:04.634
- What kinda guy is he?

40:08.140 --> 40:09.672
- I'm never afraid
of what he might do.

40:09.674 --> 40:11.741
I'm just afraid of
what I might do.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.513
- And what's that?

40:20.819 --> 40:22.018
- I don't wanna talk about.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.420
- You don't wanna talk about it?

40:23.422 --> 40:25.722
- I'm just trying to
leave my past behind.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.290
- No, hey, I get it.

40:27.291 --> 40:28.857
You just want to leave
your past behind you,

40:28.860 --> 40:30.616
you won't talk about it.

40:30.617 --> 40:32.373
It's alright, 'cause
I'll find it for myself.

40:32.374 --> 40:34.130
- Get out the way, get out of
the way.
- [A.J.] Jon, please, no, Jon,
please.

40:34.132 --> 40:35.965
- Where is it?
What are you hiding, huh?

40:36.535 --> 40:37.667
What is it?

40:39.104 --> 40:40.537
What is this?

40:48.180 --> 40:49.346
Is this for me?

40:49.347 --> 40:50.513
- I don't think I want
you to have it anymore.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.850
- Okay, listen, I'm sorry.

40:54.453 --> 40:55.852
I am so sorry.

40:57.689 --> 40:58.721
Please.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.826
- I just feel like
I don't want you

41:03.995 --> 41:05.862
to think like I'm
one of those people.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.899
- I think you are unlike anybody

41:09.901 --> 41:11.734
I have ever met before.

41:13.171 --> 41:16.039
Okay?
(gentle music)

41:16.775 --> 41:18.541
Why, I don't, why Charlie?

41:18.543 --> 41:19.742
Why do you want to be around
all that dealing and using?

41:19.744 --> 41:23.746
- I just needed a place to stay
to get away from my boyfriend.

41:28.820 --> 41:29.986
- Do you still care about him?

41:35.827 --> 41:37.060
- I care about you.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.029
He was everything to me.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.668
You can't just change
one thing in your life

41:45.670 --> 41:49.772
and expect your
whole life to change.

41:54.880 --> 41:55.829
You know?

41:55.830 --> 41:56.779
That's why I have to
change everything in mine.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.848
- Hey, hey, please.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.184
I want you to stay, okay?

42:01.186 --> 42:01.951
- I should go.

42:01.953 --> 42:04.220
- Then let me pick
you up tomorrow.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.855
Okay, let me pick you up.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.558
- Same place?

42:09.194 --> 42:10.894
- I will be there.

42:12.631 --> 42:13.763
Okay?

42:14.099 --> 42:15.732
Come here.

42:21.806 --> 42:23.006
- [A.J.] I need to go.

42:45.564 --> 42:48.131
(steady instrumental music)
(engine revving)

42:50.302 --> 42:52.001
(water splashing)

42:54.806 --> 42:55.905
- What's she like?

42:56.041 --> 42:57.557
- Huh?

42:57.558 --> 42:59.074
- Man, we all see the
way she acts around you,

42:59.077 --> 43:00.076
you lucky mother fucker.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.110
What's she like?

43:01.680 --> 43:02.245
- A.J.?

43:02.247 --> 43:03.713
- Kelsie.

43:03.848 --> 43:05.493
- What?

43:05.494 --> 43:07.139
- Just see if you
could keep up, alright?

43:07.140 --> 43:08.785
You got the fast bike,
and when you get lost,

43:08.787 --> 43:10.853
just hit me on the cell, bitch.

43:12.824 --> 43:14.591
(engine revving)

43:20.865 --> 43:22.832
(steady ominous music)

43:30.275 --> 43:32.041
(muffled speech)

43:33.912 --> 43:36.012
(machine beeping)

43:36.948 --> 43:38.181
- [Doctor] So how
are you feeling?

43:48.026 --> 43:49.692
You fractured your pelvis.

43:52.864 --> 43:55.765
There's no way we can
splint or help the injury

43:55.767 --> 43:57.867
with a cast.

43:57.868 --> 43:59.968
You're just gonna have to wait
for the bone to heal itself.

44:10.048 --> 44:10.981
- Jon, man.

44:10.982 --> 44:11.915
Jon Jon Jon Jon,
this is bad, man.

44:11.916 --> 44:12.849
Do you want me to
take off your helmet?

44:12.850 --> 44:13.783
- God no, no no no no, don't
touch me, don't touch me.

44:14.853 --> 44:16.653
- Oh fuck, we need to
get you to a hospital.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.222
- That means you are
gonna have to stay in bed

44:19.224 --> 44:21.324
until you feel
comfortable sitting up

44:21.326 --> 44:22.158
and walking around.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.094
That might mean
months of healing.

44:26.064 --> 44:27.864
I've ordered you
some pain medication,

44:28.199 --> 44:29.666
just for your comfort.

44:30.101 --> 44:31.935
- [Dunphy] I called everybody.

44:31.936 --> 44:33.770
The only one who hasn't gotten
back to me yet is Davies.

44:36.207 --> 44:37.340
- Where's my phone, man?

44:37.342 --> 44:39.042
I gotta make a phone call.

44:39.043 --> 44:40.743
- I don't know, man.
You wanna try using my phone?

44:41.179 --> 44:43.046
- No, I need my phone, man.

44:44.049 --> 44:45.866
I need the numbers, the
numbers on my phone.

44:45.867 --> 44:47.684
- We got the same numbers, Jon.
Who are you trying to call, man?

44:47.686 --> 44:48.951
- I gotta call A.J.

44:48.953 --> 44:50.186
- I got A.J.'s number.

44:50.188 --> 44:51.821
- Jon, are you okay?

44:52.223 --> 44:54.023
I got so scared when I heard.

44:54.392 --> 44:55.825
I brought you licorice.

44:55.827 --> 44:56.926
- Thanks.

44:57.395 --> 44:59.329
Put it down.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.264
- Grady wanted me to tell you--

45:01.265 --> 45:03.199
- Kelsie, can you please
have Grady call me?

45:03.201 --> 45:03.833
I need to find my phone.

45:03.835 --> 45:05.919
- I already called
your phone, Jon.

45:05.920 --> 45:08.004
If it was even close,
we would've heard it already.

45:08.006 --> 45:08.805
- Grady's in jail.

45:08.807 --> 45:12.108
They arrested him.
(light ominous music)

45:17.716 --> 45:19.816
Grady wanted me to tell you

45:19.817 --> 45:21.917
that he needs you to get
his X-Station from his car.

45:22.854 --> 45:24.754
And he really wanted
you to get it.

45:25.190 --> 45:26.789
I don't know what that means.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.960
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

45:32.197 --> 45:33.963
(cell phone ringing)

45:42.974 --> 45:43.740
- Hey.

45:43.742 --> 45:45.208
Where are you?
(light music)

45:45.210 --> 45:48.177
I called you a couple times,
I didn't leave a message.

45:49.214 --> 45:51.080
I don't want this damn
phone to take my money.

45:51.349 --> 45:52.882
(coin clinking)

45:53.151 --> 45:54.317
There it goes.

45:55.420 --> 45:56.352
Hey look.

45:56.354 --> 45:59.155
I'm really sorry
about last night.

46:01.226 --> 46:03.092
It's almost 9:00, where are you?

46:05.230 --> 46:06.896
I can't wait to see you.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.766
Okay, call me.

46:09.901 --> 46:11.067
Bye.

46:28.319 --> 46:29.786
- No no.

46:30.121 --> 46:31.220
Wrong number.

46:31.222 --> 46:32.922
Wrong number, sorry.

46:35.460 --> 46:38.394
Okay.
(steady ethereal music)

46:44.469 --> 46:47.203
(phone beeping)

46:51.342 --> 46:52.942
Is A.J. there?

46:54.445 --> 46:56.145
Is this a payphone?

46:57.949 --> 46:58.981
Hello?

47:36.955 --> 47:38.921
- Paul Bunyan
returns to his crib

47:38.923 --> 47:41.123
after taking out
trees with his body.

47:41.526 --> 47:42.859
- Don't make me laugh, man.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.260
Don't make me laugh.

47:51.870 --> 47:53.069
(door creaking)

47:53.070 --> 47:54.269
- Hey, man, you think
they're still in there?

47:54.906 --> 47:56.873
I wish I had my cap with me.

47:59.143 --> 48:00.510
- [Jon] You see anything?

48:00.511 --> 48:01.878
- [Dunphy] No, there's
nobody up here.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.246
- Oh, shit, this is real, dude.

48:03.248 --> 48:04.280
Shit just got so real.

48:05.016 --> 48:05.281
What the fuck is this?

48:05.283 --> 48:07.917
That's it, man, I'm getting a
pit bull.
I'm getting a pit bull.

48:07.918 --> 48:10.552
- Alright, just chill
the fuck out, okay?

48:10.555 --> 48:11.454
- No one's gonna come
in this fucking house again.

48:13.358 --> 48:14.891
- That's real, man.

48:15.460 --> 48:16.893
Yeah, the dog idea's good.

48:16.895 --> 48:18.294
We're gonna go on the dog idea.

48:18.897 --> 48:20.162
- This is so fucked, man.

48:20.632 --> 48:22.899
This is bullshit, it was staged.

48:24.903 --> 48:27.053
- Man, I'm just glad I was
with you when it happened

48:27.054 --> 48:29.204
'cause I don't like
being accused of shit that I
didn't do.

48:29.207 --> 48:30.607
You see what I'm saying?

48:30.608 --> 48:32.008
- It's all fucking
smoke and mirrors, man.

48:32.009 --> 48:33.409
They came in and out
of the fucking window.

48:35.146 --> 48:36.312
- Davies, man.

48:37.382 --> 48:38.347
Think about it.

48:39.017 --> 48:40.700
Fucking Davies, man.

48:40.701 --> 48:42.384
I mean, who else knows
this place, right,

48:42.387 --> 48:43.319
better than he does?

48:43.321 --> 48:44.988
And your girl...

48:44.989 --> 48:46.656
I mean, she wouldn't
steal from you because

48:46.657 --> 48:48.324
it'd be like stealing
from herself, right?

48:48.325 --> 48:49.992
I mean, you don't think
she'd steal from you, do you?

48:51.696 --> 48:53.496
I'm just gonna go
check in the back.

48:53.497 --> 48:55.297
Just chill out for just
one second, alright?

48:55.300 --> 48:56.332
- Oh fuck.

48:57.335 --> 48:59.235
(light somber music)

49:00.204 --> 49:01.270
Shit.

49:29.033 --> 49:30.266
(gasping)

49:34.505 --> 49:36.238
(urine trickling)

50:33.498 --> 50:35.231
Hey, Charlie.

50:38.302 --> 50:39.802
Charlie, Charlie.

50:39.804 --> 50:42.371
- Jonny, I've been calling.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.572
- Yeah, sorry man.

50:43.574 --> 50:44.373
I lost my phone.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.509
- Are you alright, buddy?

50:46.511 --> 50:47.643
- Mm hmm.

50:47.645 --> 50:50.780
Is A.J. here?

50:50.782 --> 50:52.481
- Well, listen, come in.

50:52.717 --> 50:53.516
What happened?

50:53.518 --> 50:55.651
You need to sit down?
- Mm mm, no.

50:58.589 --> 50:59.438
No, I can't stay,
I gotta find A.J.

50:59.439 --> 51:00.288
- Oh, I'm sorry about the place.

51:01.359 --> 51:04.093
It bothers me so much to
be seen living like this,

51:04.095 --> 51:07.229
but there's not much I
can do from this chair.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.098
- I was supposed to pick
her up days ago, man.

51:09.100 --> 51:11.333
- Whoa whoa whoa, you're hurt.

51:11.569 --> 51:12.701
Is she hurt?

51:12.703 --> 51:14.537
- No, no.

51:15.339 --> 51:16.305
She wasn't with me.

51:16.641 --> 51:17.506
But I cracked my pelvis.

51:17.508 --> 51:21.510
- Your pelvis, man, how
are you even leaning?

51:21.813 --> 51:23.079
(bottle rattling)

51:23.081 --> 51:25.581
I wouldn't lean
to much on those.

51:25.583 --> 51:29.618
- So, do you know
where she could be,

51:29.620 --> 51:31.220
where she's at, anything?

51:31.222 --> 51:35.191
- Look, you should worry
about yourself right now.

51:35.493 --> 51:36.592
You need to heal up.

51:36.594 --> 51:39.795
She's known for these
disappearing acts.

51:39.797 --> 51:41.297
She'll come around.

51:41.632 --> 51:43.299
I'm sure she's fine.

51:43.601 --> 51:44.633
She's a smart one.

51:45.369 --> 51:47.336
Hey, I love you buddy.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.173
You take care.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.377
- I love you too.

51:55.379 --> 51:57.780
I wish I could
help you clean up, man.

51:57.782 --> 51:59.482
I hate seeing you like this.

52:01.285 --> 52:06.388
- You know, I never set out
to make a mark in the world.

52:08.392 --> 52:10.626
I just don't want
to leave a stain.

52:13.331 --> 52:18.134
I'll die if anybody sees me
living in filth like this.

52:20.238 --> 52:21.270
- Hey.

52:23.541 --> 52:25.674
A.J. told me about your cancer.

52:26.844 --> 52:28.277
It's terminal.

52:30.481 --> 52:31.580
- Ah.

52:33.484 --> 52:35.518
It's all the same ending, kid.

52:37.155 --> 52:39.155
We're all terminal.

52:39.457 --> 52:41.423
(gentle music)

52:41.659 --> 52:43.259
You'll find her.

52:46.564 --> 52:48.531
- I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

53:03.481 --> 53:04.747
(knocking on door)

53:08.853 --> 53:10.686
- Get him and kill him, Rolie.

53:11.455 --> 53:13.255
(knocking on door)

53:19.330 --> 53:21.230
- [Delivery Man] China Lantern,
delivery.

53:21.732 --> 53:22.798
- [Jon] What?

53:22.800 --> 53:25.668
- [Delivery Man]
Delivery, you called.

53:27.738 --> 53:29.471
- I didn't order no delivery,
man.

53:33.744 --> 53:35.344
- [Delivery Man] China Lantern.

53:43.955 --> 53:45.487
- Hey, man.

53:48.292 --> 53:49.425
I forgot.

53:52.830 --> 53:53.862
How much do I owe you?

53:53.864 --> 53:54.897
- 29 bucks.

53:54.899 --> 53:56.498
- Okay.

54:02.240 --> 54:03.672
Here, keep the change.

54:03.841 --> 54:05.307
- Thanks.

54:09.714 --> 54:10.813
- See ya.

54:30.668 --> 54:31.600
Rolie.

54:31.602 --> 54:33.769
What kind of guard dog are you?

54:41.312 --> 54:43.545
(steady ethereal music)

54:52.690 --> 54:53.822
(sniffing)

55:28.993 --> 55:31.327
(phone ringing)

55:35.866 --> 55:37.466
- [Grady] Yo, can you hear me?

55:37.735 --> 55:38.601
It's me, Grady.

55:38.602 --> 55:39.468
What the fuck happened to you?

55:39.470 --> 55:42.604
- Man, you got to
knock it down a bit.

55:42.606 --> 55:43.706
I can't take this.

55:43.708 --> 55:44.840
- Yo, you high as hell.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.076
- I got robbed, man.

55:47.078 --> 55:48.477
They took all my product.

55:48.813 --> 55:49.845
They took all my money.

55:49.846 --> 55:50.878
- What, didn't I tell you?
Bounce that bitch?

55:50.881 --> 55:53.882
- No no, it ain't like that,
man.

55:54.418 --> 55:55.451
- Like what?

55:55.452 --> 55:56.485
Put money first or
you get hurt, boy.

55:56.487 --> 55:58.938
Yo, you better fuck
someone up quick.

55:58.939 --> 56:01.390
Anyone, or it's open
season on that ass.

56:01.392 --> 56:03.359
- We think we know who did it.

56:04.662 --> 56:05.894
I keep hearing Davies, man.

56:05.896 --> 56:08.697
I keep hearing his name.

56:08.699 --> 56:10.632
- Listen, I ain't got much time
to be talking on this phone.

56:11.602 --> 56:13.035
Yo, they trying to
extend my sentence.

56:13.037 --> 56:14.937
My lawyer ain't picking
up the damn phone.

56:14.939 --> 56:16.672
You gotta tell him
to come see me.

56:17.842 --> 56:19.441
Yo, you gotta tell him.

56:20.578 --> 56:21.844
- Tell who?

56:22.913 --> 56:23.879
Who man?

56:23.881 --> 56:25.447
Who do I tell?

56:27.051 --> 56:28.417
Hello?

56:45.669 --> 56:46.802
- Afternoon.

56:47.004 --> 56:47.970
- Hi.

56:47.971 --> 56:48.937
- How can I help ya?

56:51.542 --> 56:54.476
- Can you please
help me refill these?

56:54.645 --> 56:55.677
Thanks.

56:55.946 --> 56:57.379
- I'm sorry, sir.

56:57.380 --> 56:58.813
This prescription
refill's been satisfied.

56:58.816 --> 57:02.751
I'm not authorized to
dispense a further dosage

57:02.753 --> 57:03.819
without a new one.

57:05.556 --> 57:06.588
- But.

57:08.793 --> 57:10.726
I don't understand, man.

57:10.728 --> 57:12.044
I need to get my medication.

57:12.045 --> 57:13.361
This was prescribed to me.

57:13.362 --> 57:14.678
- [Pharmacist] Yeah, I
understand,
but there's nothing that I can
do.

57:14.679 --> 57:15.995
You're gonna have
to ask your doctor

57:16.000 --> 57:17.867
to write you a new one.

57:17.868 --> 57:19.735
- I don't know how
to contact him.

57:19.736 --> 57:21.603
He's not my personal
doctor, you know?

57:21.604 --> 57:23.471
He's, come on, man, I mean,
he's the guy at the hospital

57:23.474 --> 57:25.841
that treated me when
I fractured my bones.

57:25.843 --> 57:28.577
- Yeah, I understand sir, but
there's nothing that I can do.

57:29.747 --> 57:31.455
- Are you serious right now?

57:31.456 --> 57:33.164
That doesn't make
sense to me, man.

57:33.165 --> 57:34.873
You're supposed to help me.

57:34.874 --> 57:36.582
I'm supposed to get my
prescription
here, at the pharmacy where you
work.

57:36.587 --> 57:37.820
You're a pharmacist, correct?

57:37.822 --> 57:39.055
- Yes.

57:39.056 --> 57:40.289
- How am I supposed to
handle this then?

57:40.290 --> 57:41.523
You tell me, how do I
handle this?

57:41.525 --> 57:44.526
- Is there anything
else that I can get you?

57:47.131 --> 57:48.664
- This is bullshit.

57:49.133 --> 57:50.699
It's bullshit.

58:27.238 --> 58:29.771
(steady suspenseful music)

58:31.909 --> 58:33.509
- Fucking junkies.

58:34.545 --> 58:35.177
- Hey.

58:35.179 --> 58:36.195
- Hey what?

58:36.196 --> 58:37.212
You fucking think you know me?

58:37.214 --> 58:38.647
What do you need?

58:41.619 --> 58:44.753
- I guess like, 10,
20, how many you got?

58:45.890 --> 58:47.756
- We only got like 600 pills.

58:51.295 --> 58:52.177
I got 60s left.

58:52.178 --> 58:53.060
- Alright, just
give me all of it.

59:05.676 --> 59:06.942
- You know they're
60 bucks a piece.

59:06.944 --> 59:08.076
When do I see the rest?

59:08.879 --> 59:09.878
- Just call me Monday.

59:09.880 --> 59:10.913
- No.

59:12.750 --> 59:14.016
You know how this works, right?

59:14.752 --> 59:15.817
You call me.

59:17.988 --> 59:18.654
- Yeah, yeah we're cool.

59:18.656 --> 59:21.957
- Yeah we're fucking cool.
You'd know it if we weren't.

59:26.730 --> 59:27.763
Hey.

59:28.065 --> 59:29.798
Monday is Monday.

59:32.236 --> 59:33.702
Not Tuesday.

59:36.840 --> 59:38.774
(engine revving)

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:12.908
(steady ominous music)

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:48.677
(knocking on door)

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.153
(banging on door)

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:14.202
- [Kelsie] Jon's not here.

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:17.773
- Do you know when
he'll be back?

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:20.008
- [Kelsie] Did you
check his house?

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.913
- Why don't you just tell him
that Dakin is here to talk to
him.

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:27.349
- [Kelsie] Do you want
me to give him a message

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.850
when I see him?

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:32.087
- No, I'll just come back by
a little later.

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:35.123
You gonna be around later?

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:44.099
Hey Jonny, you better
fucking call me.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:47.703
- Yo Jon, what's up?

01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:50.172
Did you get my extension yet?

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:05.854
- You look different.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:13.261
(door slamming)

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:15.997
(steady suspenseful music)

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.906
(glass shattering)

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.334
(gasping)

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:54.202
Oh, hello!

01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:56.905
Aren't you super cute?

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.840
Where'd you come from?
(dog whimpering)

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.280
What's in here?

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.017
Is this your toy?

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:11.319
This is not a toy.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:20.796
(door slamming)

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:23.965
Is that your puppy in the room?

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:26.034
- Yeah.

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:28.069
Yeah yeah, I got a pit bull.

01:03:28.071 --> 01:03:29.304
He's gonna guard my shit.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.906
- Pit bull? He's so cute.

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:32.307
I think he's a French bull dog.

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:33.208
- No.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.811
His name's Rolie,
he's a pit bull.

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:38.246
He'll roll up on you
and fuck you up.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:40.048
- Are you okay?

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.283
- Yeah.

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:43.952
Is that Grady's?

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:46.288
- Yeah.

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.090
- Good.

01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:49.257
He's been bugging me about it.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:03:58.834
(door slamming)

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:01.269
(steady suspenseful music)

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.358
- [Davies] Oh, by the way,
I stole these glasses from you.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.477
I'm fucking taking 'em.

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:00.595
- [Grady] Yo, you better fuck
someone up quick, anyone,

01:05:00.597 --> 01:05:02.464
or it's open season on that ass.

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:05.500
- [Davies] Fuck you, Jon.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.302
(shattering)

01:05:20.217 --> 01:05:20.916
- Kelsie.

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.984
Kelsie, oh my God, Kelsie.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.153
- I don't know what happened.

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:26.454
- Are you hurt?

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:29.591
- [Kelsie] I dropped the
dinner that I made you,

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.927
and I went and broke the bowl.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:37.332
- What?

01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:39.200
- I figured you'd be hungry,

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:41.937
so I made you tomato soup.

01:05:45.409 --> 01:05:46.541
- No.

01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:48.276
No, no.

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.078
I'm not hungry.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.547
- [Kelsie] Are you
playing video games?

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:58.987
- No, no, I'm not.

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.090
- Jon, are you okay?

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:04.526
- Yeah.

01:06:04.528 --> 01:06:06.494
Yeah, you keep asking me that.

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:09.431
- Are you sure?

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.234
- No, I'm lying.
(door slamming)

01:06:14.037 --> 01:06:14.569
- [Kelsie] My mom always said,

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:19.040
"no one's a good liar unless
they're lying to themselves."

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:25.013
- I am not lying about myself,

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:27.482
to myself, okay?

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:29.384
Okay?

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:30.518
(door slamming)

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:33.488
- Are you on drugs?

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.525
- Get out.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:40.595
Get out.

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.062
Get the fuck out.
(door slamming)

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:08.023
Charlie.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:14.162
(steady somber music)

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:22.137
Charlie, buddy?

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.532
Char--

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:29.636
Charlie?

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:39.613
Charlie.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.649
(weeping)

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:15.443
(phone dialing)

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:23.251
Hello, I was wondering if
could check in on my friend?

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:30.592
It's been a few days and
I'm starting to get worried.

01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:34.362
Charlie.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.334
(ominous music)

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:27.348
(phone ringing)

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.017
- [Attendant]
Promises Rehab Center.

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.685
How can I help you?

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:32.587
- [Jon] Hi.

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:37.792
My name's Jon, and I
have a problem.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.695
- [Attendant] Well it's
really great that you called.

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:41.896
We can help you.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.967
(eerie music)
(machine beeping)

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:47.302
- [Jon] How can you help?

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:49.020
- [Attendant] We specialize in
the treatment

01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:50.737
for all types of addictions.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:51.873
What are you using?

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:56.678
- [Jon] I'm not really sure
how to pronounce it.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.617
Oxycodone.

01:12:02.619 --> 01:12:04.219
- [Attendant] I've been
sober for four years,

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:05.820
and I've dedicated my
life to helping people

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.488
with all types of addictions.

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:10.825
And that one is the only one

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.560
that feels better than love.

01:12:14.898 --> 01:12:16.531
- [Doctor] How are you feeling?

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:19.334
You fractured your pelvis.

01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:21.786
- [Attendant] Please be
very careful,

01:12:21.787 --> 01:12:23.604
'cause the side effects
include severe depression

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:25.623
and suicidal thoughts.

01:12:25.624 --> 01:12:27.641
It's important that you get
professional help immediately.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.413
(voices overlapping)

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:34.382
Jon, Jon, Jon! This is bad, man.
This is bad, man.

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:37.518
- [Jon] God no, no no no no.
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:40.588
(yelling)

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.359
- [Davies] Fuck you, Jon.

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:47.095
You like that?
(glass shattering)

01:12:47.097 --> 01:12:49.630
- [A.J.] You did it again.

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:50.498
- [Jon] What?

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:54.635
- [A.J.] You showed me you.
(voices echoing)

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.574
- [Grady] I'm watching you,
bitch.

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:02.643
(ominous music)

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:07.482
- [Charlie] I never set out
to make a mark in the world.

01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:11.786
I just don't wanna
leave a stain.

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:17.725
It's all the same ending, kid.

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:20.928
We're all terminal.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.398
(birds chirping)

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:41.682
- [A.J.] It's me, A.J.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:42.984
Look, I really need money.

01:13:42.986 --> 01:13:47.455
Okay, I'm at Grace Heights,
number 302.

01:13:47.991 --> 01:13:49.490
Bye.

01:13:57.967 --> 01:13:59.934
(steady ominous music)

01:14:20.557 --> 01:14:21.722
- A.J.?

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:27.562
Hey.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:31.766
A.J.?

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:35.970
Hey.

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:36.971
Hey hey hey.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:40.041
Hey, what's wrong, are you okay?

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:44.645
- [A.J.] You're here.

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:47.148
- Yeah, yeah I'm here.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.649
Of course I'm here.

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:52.053
How long have you been
in this room, babe?

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.722
- I can't believe it's you.

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:57.525
I called you every single day.

01:14:59.229 --> 01:15:00.895
- I looked everywhere for you.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.630
I was so worried about you.

01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:05.967
Look, come on.

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:07.201
Come on. We gotta go.

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:08.903
We gotta go, come on.

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:10.604
- No, no, no, I can't.
Can you help me, please?

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:11.973
- Of course.

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:14.642
- I just, I really need money.

01:15:14.644 --> 01:15:16.511
- No, you need to
leave with me now.

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:17.979
You need to leave with me now.
- I can't, I can't.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.446
- Come on, come on.
A.J., come with me, please.

01:15:19.447 --> 01:15:20.913
- I can't, I can't.
- [Jon] Come with me, please.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:23.017
- I can't. I can't.

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:25.853
- You have to.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:30.925
(crying)

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:40.668
I wish,

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:43.771
I wish we could
run away together.

01:15:46.009 --> 01:15:48.676
(somber music)

01:16:03.026 --> 01:16:04.592
Fuck!

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:07.662
- He gone?

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:13.134
- Stop.

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:17.838
- Baby, where is it?

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.073
Where's the money?

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:22.209
Hey, hey, you said
you could get money.

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:23.778
- I don't know.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.414
- Well, where the fuck is it?

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.582
- I don't know.
(suspenseful music)

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:38.593
(tires screeching)

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:48.286
- You wouldn't be avoiding me,
huh?

01:16:48.287 --> 01:16:49.704
Is this a convenient
time for you to talk?

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.975
You look so glad to see me.

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:55.176
Look at you.

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:57.278
You fucking junkie.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.846
You got my fucking money, right?

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:01.182
What, do you think
you're going somewhere?

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:02.683
No.

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:06.854
Open the door.

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:10.808
Open the fucking door.

01:17:10.809 --> 01:17:12.392
- Fuck you, fuck you.
- Fuck me?

01:17:12.395 --> 01:17:13.995
No, fuck you.
(pounding)

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:14.895
- Get the fuck off my car.

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:19.634
- You cock sucker, open
this God damn door.

01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:20.868
- Twenty grand!
- Fuck you!

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:23.904
(yelling)
(tires screeching)

01:17:31.914 --> 01:17:35.116
Get back here with
my fucking money.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.221
(ethereal music)

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:18.092
(gentle music)

01:18:18.394 --> 01:18:20.227
(knocking on door)

01:18:31.974 --> 01:18:33.774
(dog whimpering)

01:18:34.977 --> 01:18:36.243
- Hey, little buddy.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:37.778
Where'd you come from?

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:44.185
I got your dog.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:48.255
Let's go, Giant.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:13.047
(phone ringing)

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:14.949
Hello?

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:17.184
- [Jon] His name is Rolie.

01:19:17.186 --> 01:19:18.285
- What?

01:19:19.388 --> 01:19:20.988
- The dog.

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:24.024
Take care of him for me.

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:27.128
- Jon, fuck.

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:30.064
Dude, I'm hearing some
