00:02.127 --> 00:03.253
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:03.336 --> 00:05.422
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.757
- MORNING, LADIES.
WHAT'S UP?

00:07.841 --> 00:09.968
- ELKA'S TEACHING ME
HOW TO FLIRT.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.387
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN
A HAPPENIN' NIGHT SPOT,

00:12.470 --> 00:16.933
AND I'M DRESSED
VERY PROVOCATIVELY.

00:17.016 --> 00:20.812
- EXCUSE ME,
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

00:20.895 --> 00:25.275
- HAVE WE STARTED
OR ARE YOU REALLY ASKING?

00:25.358 --> 00:28.027
- YOU SEE
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST?

00:28.111 --> 00:29.946
- GOOD MORNING, LADIES.
- WHERE'S OSCAR?

00:30.029 --> 00:30.989
- UNPACKING.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.615
- OSCAR? WHO'S HE?

00:32.698 --> 00:34.617
- SHE.
MY DAUGHTER.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.286
AFTER I HAD EMMY AND TONY,

00:36.369 --> 00:41.082
I WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE
AN OSCAR NO MATTER WHAT.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.459
- OSCAR'S BEEN STUDYING
JOURNALISM IN LONDON

00:42.542 --> 00:43.626
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.961
NOW SHE WORKS FOR NPR.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.963
- YEAH, AND SHE'S HERE TO DO
A STORY ON ME.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.006
- ACTUALLY,
IT'S A STORY ABOUT US

00:48.089 --> 00:49.466
MOVING FROM L.A.
TO CLEVELAND.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.593
- IT'S ABOUT SECOND ACTS
IN LIFE

00:51.676 --> 00:54.012
AND HOW I MOVED HERE
AND RE-INVENTED MYSELF.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.306
-<i> WE</i> RE-INVENTED OURSELVES.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.141
- WELL, I HOPE THAT'S NOT
THE SELFISH TONE

00:58.224 --> 01:01.102
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
IN THE INTERVIEW.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.480
- HAS ANYONE SEEN MY CAR KEYS?

01:03.563 --> 01:05.940
I'M RUNNING LATE
FOR A MANICURIST APPOINTMENT.

01:06.024 --> 01:11.196
- QUESTION: DO THEY CHARGE YOU
EXTRA FOR THOSE BIG MAN-HANDS?

01:13.364 --> 01:14.824
- IGNORE HER, JOY.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.660
YOUR BIG MAN-HANDS
ARE IN PERFECT PROPORTION

01:17.744 --> 01:21.998
TO YOUR BIG MAN-FEET.

01:22.081 --> 01:24.834
- SERIOUSLY,
NO ONE'S SEEN MY KEYS?

01:24.918 --> 01:27.504
CHANCE,
HAVE YOU SEEN MY KEYS?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.297
[car keys beep]

01:30.965 --> 01:34.302
[car keys beep]

01:34.385 --> 01:36.846
UH-OH.

01:45.104 --> 01:48.817
{\an8}- OH, THERE'S MY FAVORITE CHILD.
- MOM.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.360
{\an8}- WHAT?
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING

01:50.443 --> 01:53.738
{\an8}THAT YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER
DON'T TELL THEIR THERAPISTS.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.073
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, MOM,
I THINK

01:55.156 --> 01:56.074
{\an8}IT WAS ALL
THE PRACTICE INTERVIEWS

01:56.157 --> 01:57.283
{\an8}YOU HAD ME DO AS A CHILD

01:57.367 --> 01:58.368
{\an8}THAT MADE ME WANT TO BE
A JOURNALIST.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.162
{\an8}- AWW.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.914
{\an8}SO NOW THAT YOU'RE
A REAL JOURNALIST,

02:02.997 --> 02:04.207
{\an8}WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK ME?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.875
{\an8}- WELL,
THE FOCUS OF THE PIECE

02:05.959 --> 02:07.669
{\an8}IS HOW YOU'VE CHANGED SINCE YOU
MOVED TO CLEVELAND.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.378
{\an8}- WELL, OF COURSE
THE BIGGEST CHANGE

02:09.461 --> 02:11.881
{\an8}IS THAT I'M DATING
SIR EMMET LAWSON.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.551
{\an8}- THAT'S GREAT,
BUT YOU'VE DATED ACTORS BEFORE.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.386
{\an8}WHAT I MEAN IS,
WHAT'S REALLY CHANGED?

02:16.469 --> 02:18.346
{\an8}- OH, YOU MEAN,
THE WOODY ALLEN MOVIE?

02:18.429 --> 02:20.473
{\an8}WELL, THAT IS, LIKE, HUGE.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.892
{\an8}- IT IS, BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
AN ACTRESS.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.561
{\an8}HOW HAVE YOU CHANGED
PERSONALLY?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.605
{\an8}- OH, I-I SEE WHERE
YOU'RE GOING HERE.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.191
{\an8}LIKE, UM, HOW AM I GOING
TO HANDLE

02:30.275 --> 02:33.862
{\an8}ALL THIS FAME AND FORTUNE
THAT'S COMING MY WAY?

02:33.945 --> 02:35.655
{\an8}- MAYBE WE CAN GET
MELANIE AND JOY IN ON THIS.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.073
{\an8}ARE THEY AROUND?

02:37.156 --> 02:39.242
{\an8}- NO, THE DOG ATE
JOY'S KEYS.

02:39.325 --> 02:43.746
{\an8}FOR SOME REASON,
THEY ALL WENT TO THE VET.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.248
{\an8}- SHOULDN'T WE GO WITH THEM?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.249
{\an8}- OH, NO, NO, NO.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.251
{\an8}THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE PLACE
TO INTERVIEW ME.

02:48.334 --> 02:52.463
{\an8}ALL THAT BARKING
AND MEOWING AND--

02:52.547 --> 02:53.882
{\an8}- VICTORIA CHASE--
NOT AN ANIMAL PERSON.

02:53.965 --> 02:54.883
{\an8}EXPAND LATER.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.301
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO.

02:56.384 --> 02:57.760
{\an8}YOU CAN'T SAY THAT I'M NOT
AN ANIMAL PERSON.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.470
{\an8}PEOPLE WOULD HATE ME.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.599
{\an8}NO, I MEAN,
MY CAREER COULD BE RUINED.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.809
{\an8}I KNOW NO ONE LISTENS TO NPR,

03:04.893 --> 03:07.145
BUT YOU KNOW,
IT COULD BE PICKED UP

03:07.228 --> 03:11.441
BY AN ESTABLISHED SOURCE LIKE
<i>ACCESS HOLLYWOOD</i> OR <i> TMZ LIVE.</i>

03:11.524 --> 03:12.775
YOU HAVE TO ERASE THAT.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.819
- NO, MOM.
I CAN'T.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.946
- "NO"?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.948
BUT YOU NEVER SAY NO TO ME.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.118
YOU ALWAYS DO JUST
WHAT I SAY.

03:22.201 --> 03:25.580
IT'S WHAT WE LOVE
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.457
- MOM, I HAVE TO TELL
THE TRUTH.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.167
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

03:29.250 --> 03:32.170
BECAUSE YOU NEVER LEARNED IT
FROM ME.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.130
- MOM, I LEARNED IT
IN JOURNALISM SCHOOL.

03:34.213 --> 03:37.467
THIS IS MY JOB--
TO OBSERVE AND REPORT.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.969
- WELL...

03:40.053 --> 03:43.514
IF YOU NEED TO REPORT
THE TRUTH,

03:43.598 --> 03:46.643
THERE'S NOTHING I WOULDN'T DO
FOR ANY ANIMAL ANYWHERE.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.645
- SINCE WHEN?

03:48.728 --> 03:50.480
- SINCE I MOVED TO CLEVELAND.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.690
THIS IS MY SECOND ACT.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.108
I LOVE ANIMALS.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.361
I LOVE ANIMALS
MORE THAN PEOPLE.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.112
NO, NO.
THAT'S GOING TOO FAR.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.614
OKAY, WE CAN TWEAK THIS
ON THE WAY TO THE VET.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.950
COME ON.

04:04.285 --> 04:07.538
- YOU KNOW, I RATHER LIKE
A VET'S OFFICE.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.959
I RATHER LIKE IT A LOT.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.293
- OH, JOY,
PLEASE DON'T.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.962
- WHAT IS SHE DOING?

04:14.045 --> 04:15.588
- SOMETHING HAPPENS TO JOY
WHEN SHE SEES

04:15.672 --> 04:17.048
A MAN BRINGING A PET
TO A DOCTOR.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.509
IT'S HER LOVE KRYPTONITE.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.345
- IT SHOWS THEY'RE SENSITIVE,
COMMITTED, RESPONSIBLE,

04:22.428 --> 04:25.598
YET SOMEHOW STILL MEN.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.560
I'M GOING IN.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.814
- I WISH I HAD THAT KIND
OF CONFIDENCE WITH MEN.

04:32.897 --> 04:36.651
- JUST COPY EVERYTHING
SHE DOES.

04:36.734 --> 04:40.321
- I DON'T THINK I COULD
PULL OFF THAT SKIRT.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.992
- MANY HAVE.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.954
- DON'T WORRY, I'M HERE.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.581
EXCUSE ME,
I'M HERE FOR CHANCE OSTROVSKY.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.543
PLEASE TELL ME I CAN DONATE
A KIDNEY.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.877
- HI, VICTORIA.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.879
- OH, I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.007
ARE YOU A FAN?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.884
- I'M SALLY, YOUR NEIGHBOR.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.720
- I DON'T THINK SO.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.889
- I'VE LIVED NEXT DOOR TO YOU
FOR THREE YEARS.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.349
YOU GAVE ME A MAKEOVER.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.726
YOU ONCE CALLED THE COPS

05:09.809 --> 05:11.227
'CAUSE MY KID'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
WAS TOO LOUD

05:11.310 --> 05:12.562
AND YOU HAD A HANGOVER.

05:12.645 --> 05:16.065
- IN MY DEFENSE,
WHO HAS A PARTY

05:16.149 --> 05:18.693
ON SATURDAY MORNING
AT 11:00?

05:18.776 --> 05:21.738
- CHILDREN.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.614
- OF COURSE, CHILDREN.

05:23.698 --> 05:27.910
WHOM I LOVE AS MUCH
AS IF THEY WERE ANIMALS.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.124
- UGH.
FORGET THAT GUY.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.459
- MARRIED?
- YES.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.586
AND SO CONCEITED ABOUT IT.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.921
"OH, MY WIFE, MY KIDS,
MY LAKE HOUSE."

05:39.005 --> 05:42.925
WE GET IT.
SOMEONE LOVES YOU. DROP DEAD.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.261
- SO AS PART OF YOUR SECOND ACT
IN CLEVELAND,

05:45.344 --> 05:47.597
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT APPROACHING MEN?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.767
- CLEVELAND'S DEFINITELY
GIVEN ME A NEW CONFIDENCE.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.935
NOT THAT I SUCCEED
ALL THE TIME,

05:53.019 --> 05:55.104
BUT IF I GET REJECTED HERE,

05:55.188 --> 05:56.814
I KNOW IT'S NOT BECAUSE
OF MY AGE.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.025
IT'S BECAUSE
OF MY PERSONALITY.

05:59.108 --> 06:03.279
AND THAT FEELS GOOD.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.114
- OF COURSE, I DON'T NEED
TO BE HITTING ON GUYS

06:05.198 --> 06:08.242
BECAUSE I'M DATING
SIR EMMET LAWSON.

06:08.326 --> 06:12.038
- MAMIE'S THE ONE WHO NEEDS
TO BE HITTING ON GUYS.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.290
- GO FLIRT WITH THAT RABBIT GUY
OVER THERE.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.626
- I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.294
- WELL, YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION
STARTER RIGHT THERE.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.296
ASK HIM ABOUT HIS RABBIT.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.886
- OH, ALL RIGHT.
HERE GOES NOTHING.

06:30.431 --> 06:35.561
EXCUSE ME.
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

06:35.645 --> 06:38.856
- NO.

06:42.735 --> 06:47.490
- SO, YOUR RABBIT'S EYES
ARE REALLY CRUSTED OVER.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.329
- WELL, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

06:53.412 --> 06:57.667
- I BET IT IS.

06:57.750 --> 07:01.379
I BET IT IS.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.714
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.302
WELL, I TRIED.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.179
MAYBE IT'S JUST TOO LATE
FOR ME.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.890
- OH, IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.
LOOK AT ME.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.809
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, MELANIE?
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

07:14.892 --> 07:16.519
- OH, WELL, EVER SINCE I MOVED
TO CLEVELAND,

07:16.602 --> 07:17.979
I HAVE BEEN DATING A LOT.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.190
BUT I GOT A NEW JOB
AND I FELL IN LOVE WITH MY BOSS.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.859
AND I HOPE HE FEELS
THE SAME ABOUT ME.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.528
ALTHOUGH HIS CRAZY EX-WIFE--
ALSO MY BOSS--

07:25.611 --> 07:27.989
SHE WOULD KILL ME
IF WE EVER GOT TOGETHER.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.658
OH, MY GOD, YOU CAN'T PUT THIS
ON THE RADIO.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.535
- IT'S SO INTERESTING.
IT'S LIKE A SOAP OPERA.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.204
- YOU KNOW, WHAT'S EVEN
MORE INTERESTING

07:35.288 --> 07:38.082
IS MOVING FROM A SOAP OPERA
TO A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE

07:38.166 --> 07:40.710
DIRECTED BY WOODY ALLEN.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.378
I'M TALKING ABOUT
VICTORIA CHASE.

07:42.461 --> 07:45.631
EXPAND LATER.

07:47.466 --> 07:50.511
- PIPE DOWN, VICTORIA.
I'M IN LOVE.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.391
- COOL YOUR JETS.
HE'S GAY.

07:55.474 --> 07:56.517
- ARE YOU SURE?

07:56.601 --> 08:00.062
- SKINTIGHT JEANS,
A TEACUP PIG,

08:00.146 --> 08:05.568
IF ONLY THERE HAD BEEN
SOME CLUES.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.320
- I GIVE UP.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.905
IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER
THAN A HOT GUY

08:08.988 --> 08:10.990
WITH A TEACUP PIG.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.080
- HI.

08:18.164 --> 08:19.749
I JUST RESCUED THESE PUPPIES
FROM A FIRE.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.335
- MARRY ME.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.550
- I'M SORRY ABOUT YELLING
"MARRY ME."

08:29.634 --> 08:31.219
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.179
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I GET THAT A LOT.

08:33.261 --> 08:36.432
MOSTLY FROM WOMEN IN CARS
WHEN I RUN IN THE MORNING.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.809
- OH?
WHAT ROUTE?

08:39.894 --> 08:42.897
I MEAN, BECAUSE I RUN.
I'M A RUNNER.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.775
YEAH, ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR A GOOD ROUTE.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.444
- DID YOU REALLY RESCUE THEM
FROM A BURNING BUILDING?

08:48.527 --> 08:52.949
- OF COURSE HE DID.
LOOK AT HIM, HE'S SMOLDERING.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.492
- I'M JUST GETTING THEM
CHECKED OUT.

08:54.575 --> 08:55.785
AND THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE THEM
TO A SHELTER.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.287
- OOH,
WE CAN FIND HOMES FOR THEM.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.332
- ELKA AND I VOLUNTEER
AT A RESCUE SHELTER.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.125
- OH, WELL,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.836
YOU KNOW, TO ME,
YOU GUYS ARE THE REAL HEROES.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.881
- OH, THANK YOU.

09:14.387 --> 09:19.850
STILL THANKING.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.685
- THE DOCTOR'S READY.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.353
YOU CAN TAKE
THE PUPPIES BACK NOW.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.479
[puppies whimper]

09:23.562 --> 09:25.273
- WAIT, DON'T GO.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.483
- I GOT TO MAKE SURE THESE
LITTLE GUYS ARE OKAY.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.610
- THEY'RE FINE.
I CAN TELL THEY LOOK GREAT.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.112
- THAT'S THE VET'S CALL.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.114
- DON'T YOU HAVE
SOME DEWORMING TO DO?

09:33.197 --> 09:36.033
SOME GLANDS TO EXPRESS?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.618
- WHILE WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE DOCTOR,

09:37.702 --> 09:39.829
I COULD GET THE REST
OF THAT SUIT OFF YOU.

09:39.912 --> 09:40.997
- YOU MEAN SOOT?

09:41.080 --> 09:44.375
- THAT TOO.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.218
- LOOK AT THAT STRIDE.

09:54.302 --> 09:58.306
ORIGINAL HIPS.

09:58.389 --> 10:01.309
- NO, ELKA.

10:01.392 --> 10:05.187
I'M REALIZING THAT FLIRTING
IS A YOUNG WOMAN'S GAME.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.315
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND LOOKS
AT YOU,

10:07.398 --> 10:09.191
HE STILL SEES
THE YOUNG GIRL HE MET

10:09.275 --> 10:10.359
AND FELL IN LOVE WITH.

10:10.443 --> 10:15.990
BUT NOW WHOEVER I FLIRT WITH
ONLY SEES AN OLDER WOMAN

10:16.073 --> 10:19.952
WITH A NO-FUSS HAIRCUT
AND NO GAME.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.331
- DON'T GIVE UP.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.206
LOOK AT ME.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.335
ALEC DUMPED
A HOT 20-SOMETHING FOR ME.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.919
MAYBE.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.171
- REALLY?
A HOT 20-SOMETHING?

10:30.254 --> 10:31.589
- YEAH, I BROKE
INTO HIS APARTMENT

10:31.672 --> 10:33.341
AND SHE SHOWED UP
AND SAID HE WENT

10:33.424 --> 10:34.383
ON VACATION WITHOUT HER

10:34.467 --> 10:37.511
BECAUSE HE HAD
TO THINK ABOUT STUFF.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.180
- AND YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE
THAT "STUFF."

10:39.263 --> 10:40.139
- MAYBE.

10:40.222 --> 10:43.100
AND AT LEAST "MAYBE" KEEPS ME
IN THE GAME.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.728
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S SORT
OF A NICE THEME FOR MY PIECE.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.230
THAT YOU GUYS CAME TO CLEVELAND
FOR WHAT MAY BE.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.231
- WELL, HOW CAN YOU COME UP
WITH A THEME

10:49.315 --> 10:53.027
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED
INTERVIEWING ME?

10:53.110 --> 10:54.904
- BUT I'M TRYING TO GET
AT SOMETHING REAL HERE.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.280
THE FOCUS OF THE PIECE
IS ON PEOPLE

10:56.364 --> 10:57.907
FINDING AN ACT TWO
IN THEIR LIVES.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.700
MELANIE AND JOY HAVE CHANGED

10:59.784 --> 11:01.202
AND FRANKLY, YOU HAVEN'T.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.412
- ARE YOU CALLING ME
A ONE ACT?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.373
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN
TO FESTIVALS

11:05.456 --> 11:06.582
WHERE ALL THEY SHOW
ARE ONE ACTS

11:06.665 --> 11:08.459
AND EVERYONE IS BORED.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.128
- LET'S LOOK AT THE FACTS.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.255
BACK IN L.A.,
JOY HAD GIVEN UP ON MEN.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.216
SHE WAS SUBLIMATING
HER SEXUALITY

11:15.299 --> 11:17.259
BY WAXING HAIR
OFF CELEBRITIES.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.430
SHE WAS A PATHETIC,
EMPTY SHELL OF A WOMAN.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.433
- THIS ISN'T GOING ON THE AIR,
IS IT?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.894
- OF COURSE IT IS,
BECAUSE NOW LOOK AT YOU.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.729
YOU'RE LIVING
FOR LOVE AND ADVENTURE.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.107
- I AM, AREN'T I?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.275
- AND MELANIE WAS
ALWAYS OVER AT OUR HOUSE,

11:33.359 --> 11:36.320
COMPLAINING ABOUT HER BORING
LIFE AND HER LOVELESS MARRIAGE.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.989
SHE WAS MOUSY AND DULL,
AND SOMETIMES WHEN SHE CAME BY,

11:39.073 --> 11:42.743
WE PRETENDED
WE WEREN'T HOME.

11:42.827 --> 11:47.123
- I JUST THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE ON VACATION A LOT.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.166
- LOOK AT YOU NOW,
ACTING ALL CRAZY,

11:49.250 --> 11:51.502
GOING AFTER THE BOSS,
BREAKING INTO APARTMENTS.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.463
YOU'RE LIKE SOME KIND
OF LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIE.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.589
- HELLO?

11:55.673 --> 11:57.633
I STARRED IN
A LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVE

11:57.716 --> 12:00.177
CALLED <i> ACTING ALL CRAZY.</i>

12:00.261 --> 12:03.681
I'VE CHANGED JUST AS MUCH
AS THESE TWO HAVE.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.307
- NOT FROM WHAT I CAN SEE.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.976
YOU'RE STILL
A DRAMA QUEEN

12:07.059 --> 12:09.270
OBSESSED WITH FAME
AND CONSTANTLY LYING

12:09.353 --> 12:11.397
TO PUT YOURSELF
IN THE BEST POSSIBLE LIGHT,

12:11.480 --> 12:13.149
LIKE PRETENDING YOU'RE INSANELY
IN LOVE WITH ANIMALS.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.734
- I DO LOVE ANIMALS!
ALL ANIMALS.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.321
THAT ANIMAL.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.489
WELL,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE, HUH?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.658
OW!

12:22.741 --> 12:24.326
WHAT IS THAT THING?

12:24.410 --> 12:28.581
- A SNAPPING TURTLE.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.125
YOU OKAY?
- NO, I'M NOT OKAY!

12:31.208 --> 12:34.211
I'VE BEEN SAVAGELY ATTACKED.

12:34.295 --> 12:39.300
SO THIS IS HOW IT ENDS:
TURTLE RABIES.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.510
- SEE?
DRAMA QUEEN.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.306
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY SWEET, LITTLE OSCAR?

12:45.389 --> 12:47.224
OKAY, MAYBE I HAVEN'T CHANGED,

12:47.308 --> 12:49.351
BUT YOU HAVE,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.854
- WELL, MAYBE I DON'T CARE
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

12:51.937 --> 12:55.024
I NEED SOME AIR.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.859
- WHY IS SHE DOING THIS TO ME?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.235
- OH, HONEY, IT'LL BE OKAY.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.528
COME ON, LET'S TAKE YOU
IN THE BACK,

12:59.612 --> 13:02.865
AND GET THAT LOOKED AT.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.075
- I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN HIT
ON MY FIREMAN

13:05.159 --> 13:09.038
WITH ALL THIS TENSION
IN THE AIR.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.706
[puppies whimpering]

13:10.789 --> 13:14.001
BUT DUTY CALLS.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.545
- WELL, THE DOCTOR SAYS
THEY'RE IN PERFECT HEALTH.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.380
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T MIND
FINDING THEM HOMES?

13:18.464 --> 13:21.509
- WE'VE ALREADY GOT INTERVIEWS
LINED UP FOR TODAY.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.010
- LIKE YOU SAID...

13:23.093 --> 13:27.264
[chuckles]
WE'RE HEROES.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.562
- IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU ALL.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.022
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE FIREHOUSE.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.566
- WAIT.
UM...

13:37.650 --> 13:41.529
I WAS WONDERING, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING SATURDAY NIGHT?

13:41.612 --> 13:45.866
- ACTUALLY, I HAVE A DATE
WITH A LOVELY BRUNETTE.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.370
- WHAT?
I'LL KILL HER.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.247
- SORRY, I WAS TRYING
TO BE CLEVER.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.581
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.376
- YOU ARE CLEVER.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.128
YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT'S RIGHT
WITH THE WORLD.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.421
EVERYTHING.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.091
- SMOOTH, JOY.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.260
- HERE'S MY NUMBER.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.053
- GREAT.

14:06.136 --> 14:11.267
I GUESS I WILL SEE YOU
ON SATURDAY.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.727
- LOOK AT ME.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.647
I'M DATING A FIREMAN.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.440
HEY, TOUGH LUCK, MARRIED GUY.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.067
I'M GOING OUT WITH A FIREMAN.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.236
SO GET IN YOUR STATION WAGON

14:22.319 --> 14:24.947
AND GO HOME TO YOUR
BEAUTIFUL WIFE, CLARISSA.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.282
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

14:26.365 --> 14:29.743
- I DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE ISSUES.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.787
BUT I'M SEEING A THERAPIST.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.415
AND A FIREMAN!

14:38.877 --> 14:40.796
- SO WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

14:40.879 --> 14:43.257
- TURTLE BITE.
- OOH!

14:43.340 --> 14:47.303
SORRY, I'M NOT USED
TO MY PATIENT TALKING TO ME.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.430
EXCEPT THE OCCASIONAL PARROT.

14:49.513 --> 14:50.931
AND THAT GETS OLD PRETTY FAST.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.017
YOU KNOW,
"POLLY WANT A CRACKER."

14:53.100 --> 14:55.894
WHY DO THEY
TEACH THEM THAT ANYWAY?

14:55.978 --> 14:58.105
CRACKERS ARE QUITE
BINDING.

14:58.188 --> 15:01.275
AND BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T
WANT A BACKED-UP BIRD.

15:01.358 --> 15:04.653
- I'M BLEEDING HERE.
- OOH, I SEE.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.155
- DON'T MIND HER.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.489
SHE JUST HAD A BIG FIGHT
WITH HER DAUGHTER.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.491
- HOW COULD SHE SAY THESE THINGS
TO ME?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.869
I MEAN, WHERE DID ALL
THIS REBELLION COME FROM?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.204
- WELL THE PARENT-CHILD
RELATIONSHIP

15:14.288 --> 15:16.206
CAN BE QUITE
A COMPLICATED ONE.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.499
I HAVE ANOTHER PATIENT NOW

15:17.583 --> 15:19.043
WHO'S HAVING SOME TROUBLE
WITH HER YOUNG.

15:19.126 --> 15:24.965
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
BECAUSE SHE ATE SOME OF THEM.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.176
- WHERE--WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THIS?

15:27.259 --> 15:29.178
- REBELLION CAN BE
A GOOD THING.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.347
NO PARENT,
WHETHER ANIMAL OR HUMAN,

15:31.430 --> 15:33.807
HAS DONE THE RIGHT JOB
UNLESS THEY ALLOW

15:33.891 --> 15:36.810
THEIR OFFSPRING TO GROW
AND CHANGE.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.188
- AWW, IT'S SO HARD.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.857
I MEAN, SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
MY CHEERLEADER,

15:41.940 --> 15:43.192
EVEN WHEN I WAS MISERABLE.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.986
ESPECIALLY RIGHT BEFORE
WE MOVED HERE

15:46.070 --> 15:47.655
AND MY CAREER WAS COMING
TO AN END,

15:47.738 --> 15:49.490
MY MARRIAGE WAS OVER.

15:49.573 --> 15:53.202
SOMETIMES SHE WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT HELD ME TOGETHER.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.580
AND THEN I MOVED IN
WITH YOU GUYS HERE IN CLEVELAND.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.707
AND I'M ACTUALLY HAPPY,

15:58.791 --> 16:00.584
AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE
THAT WITH HER,

16:00.668 --> 16:03.087
BUT SHE'S JUST MAKING ME
MISERABLE.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.880
- VICTORIA,
THAT'S HOW YOU'VE CHANGED.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.548
YOU'RE HAPPY NOW.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.094
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM HAPPY.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.720
I REALLY AM.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.181
BUT WHY CAN'T OSCAR SEE THAT?

16:14.264 --> 16:16.850
- YOU KNOW, WHEN A LIZARD
FIRST LOSES ITS TAIL,

16:16.934 --> 16:20.729
IT DOESN'T SEE--
- I-I-I GOT THIS.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.190
SHE DOESN'T SEE IT BECAUSE
YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.109
IT WAS OBVIOUS
THAT JOY AND I HAVE CHANGED

16:25.192 --> 16:27.736
BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE MISERABLE,
WE COULDN'T HIDE IT.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.363
BUT YOU WERE ABLE
TO ACT HAPPY.

16:29.446 --> 16:33.242
- DAMN MY TALENT.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.702
I NEED TO GO AND TALK TO HER.

16:34.785 --> 16:35.744
- YEAH.
SO WE DONE HERE?

16:35.828 --> 16:38.831
- I DON'T KNOW.
HAS SHE BEEN SPAYED?

16:45.462 --> 16:46.588
- GREAT WORK, ELKA.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.383
WE FOUND HOMES
FOR ALL BUT ONE.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.261
- I'M ACTUALLY GETTING KIND
OF ATTACHED TO THIS LITTLE GUY.

16:52.344 --> 16:56.807
- YOU DON'T GET A PUPPY
AND A FIREMAN IN THE SAME DAY.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.935
- HEY, IS MY MOM BACK YET?

17:00.018 --> 17:01.729
- I'M RIGHT HERE.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.439
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

17:03.522 --> 17:04.940
- I'M SORRY I GOT SO UPSET.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.650
- YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT
TO BE UPSET.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.986
I WAS ACTING LIKE
A COMPLETE IDIOT.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.113
AND I'M GLAD
YOU STOOD UP TO ME.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.364
- YOU ARE?

17:12.448 --> 17:14.616
- EVERYTHING YOU SAID ABOUT ME
WAS TRUE.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.952
I AM A DRAMA QUEEN
WHO'S OBSESSED

17:17.035 --> 17:21.498
WITH FAME AND SUCCESS
AND HOW I'M PERCEIVED.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.333
BUT YOU WERE WRONG
ABOUT ONE THING.

17:23.416 --> 17:26.127
I HAVE CHANGED.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.628
I'M REALLY HAPPY NOW,

17:27.713 --> 17:31.508
AND THIS MY SECOND ACT.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.470
AND IN THE SPIRIT
OF SECOND ACTS,

17:34.553 --> 17:36.930
WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU AND I START A NEW ONE?

17:37.014 --> 17:39.725
- I'D LIKE THAT.
- OH, BUT ONE THING.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.602
I REALLY DO LIKE ANIMALS,

17:41.685 --> 17:43.312
AND I'M SO SORRY
THAT YOU WEREN'T ABLE

17:43.395 --> 17:44.772
TO HAVE A PET
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.900
- ALLERGIES?
- WHITE CARPETS.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.820
I WISH I COULD
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.491
- I HAVE A PUPPY.
- OH, GOOD FOR YOU, ELKA.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.034
OH.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.536
AWW.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.956
DO YOU WANT THIS PUPPY?

18:03.040 --> 18:04.333
- IS NPR SPONSORED BY

18:04.416 --> 18:08.170
THE JOHN D. AND CATHERINE T.
MACARTHUR FOUNDATION?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.509
BOY, NOBODY LISTENS TO NPR,
DO THEY?

18:13.592 --> 18:15.302
I'D LOVE HIM.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.349
- THE DOCTOR WILL BE OUT
IN A MINUTE, BUT GREAT NEWS.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.975
CHANCE CAME THROUGH
WITH FLYING COLORS.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.477
- YAY!
- OH, THAT'S SUCH A RELIEF.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.396
- SO HOW ABOUT YOU?
HOW'D YOU DO WITH THE FIREMAN?

18:26.480 --> 18:29.024
- WE HAVE A DATE.
- I GIVE IT SIX MONTHS.

18:29.107 --> 18:32.236
- REALLY?

18:34.947 --> 18:37.658
- MAMIE SUE JOHNSON?

18:37.741 --> 18:41.787
- OH, MY GOSH.
TOMMY HILL?

18:41.870 --> 18:44.706
- WELL, I ACTUALLY GO
BY DR. TOMMY HILL NOW,

18:44.790 --> 18:47.835
BUT YEAH, IT'S ME.

18:47.918 --> 18:48.961
WOW.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.546
- YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

18:50.629 --> 18:54.132
- EXCELLENT DETECTIVE WORK,
JOY.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.054
- TOMMY SAT BEHIND ME
IN FIRST GRADE.

18:59.137 --> 19:01.348
- [laughs] I HAD
THE BIGGEST CRUSH ON HER.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.392
I ASKED MY FRIEND
WHAT HER NAME WAS.

19:03.475 --> 19:07.437
AND HE SAID, "MAMIE SUE JOHNSON.
SHE CAN READ."

19:07.521 --> 19:11.775
- SO HE GOT MY ATTENTION
BY THROWING A ROCK AT ME.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.236
- CUT HER HEAD RIGHT OPEN.

19:14.319 --> 19:18.949
- IT STILL THROBS
WHEN IT'S ABOUT TO RAIN.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.285
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
- GOOD.

19:21.368 --> 19:25.414
I WAS MARRIED.
7 KIDS, 19 GRANDKIDS.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.584
MY WIFE PASSED AWAY,
SO IT'S JUST ME NOW.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.835
AND YOU?

19:29.918 --> 19:31.169
- SIX BOYS.
- AH.

19:31.253 --> 19:35.299
- EIGHT GRANDKIDS.
AND IT'S JUST ME NOW TOO.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.224
- [mouths silently]

19:47.185 --> 19:50.564
- THERE WAS A RABBIT HERE
EARLIER

19:50.647 --> 19:54.776
WITH HIDEOUS, CRUSTY EYES.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.990
- OH, YOU SAW HIM?
WHAT A FASCINATING CASE.

20:00.073 --> 20:03.619
HAD AN UNFORTUNATE CONTUSION--

20:03.702 --> 20:05.412
OH, MAMIE.

20:05.495 --> 20:08.874
YOU WERE ALWAYS SUCH
A SHAMELESS FLIRT.

20:10.208 --> 20:13.170
MAY I BE FORWARD WITH YOU?
- PLEASE.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.505
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SATURDAY NIGHT?

20:15.589 --> 20:18.842
- I'M HAVING DINNER
WITH A TALL, HANDSOME DOCTOR.

20:18.926 --> 20:23.347
- OH.
- IT'S YOU.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.682
- IT'S ME?
- IT'S YOU.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.021
SEE, THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.
