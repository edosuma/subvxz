41:10.811 --> 41:14.114
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY SYMPATHY AT ALL, DO YOU?

41:14.114 --> 41:16.316
NO, I DON'T.

41:18.284 --> 41:20.821
VERONICA.

41:23.256 --> 41:27.193
KATHERYN.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.295
<i>NEXT ON "THE HAVES</i>
<i>AND THE HAVE NOTS"...</i>

41:29.295 --> 41:31.197
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN DAYS.

41:31.197 --> 41:34.535
WELL, YOU'RE ALSO A SOURCE
OF WHAT AGITATES HIM.

41:34.535 --> 41:35.802
I AM HIS MOTHER.

41:35.802 --> 41:37.704
SO, YOU WANT TO BE
MY PIMP?

41:37.704 --> 41:39.205
NO, I WANT TO BE
YOUR PARTNER.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.908
I NEED TO SEND
A CLEAR MESSAGE

41:41.908 --> 41:44.545
THAT THE MALONES ARE NOT
TO BE...WITH, EVER.

41:44.545 --> 41:47.981
I THINK THIS TOWN UNDERSTANDS
THAT, ROSE, ALREADY.

41:47.981 --> 41:51.251
[ Voice breaking ] GOD,
YOU GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

41:51.251 --> 41:53.587
I HAVE DONE MY BEST...

41:53.587 --> 41:55.689
TO DO MY BEST.

41:55.689 --> 41:57.190
AND WHAT GOOD IS IT?
