WEBVTT

00:57.691 --> 00:58.926
Brazil!

01:05.065 --> 01:06.433
Go, Brazil!

01:21.114 --> 01:22.549
Yeah! Go, Mexico!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.053
Brazil!

02:34.655 --> 02:38.258
The remaining finalists are here tonight.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.012
-All right, people, listen...
-Now is the time.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.449
My dear Luis, we should hold our breath.
It's about to start...

03:02.516 --> 03:05.686
Let's get going.
Nine competitors against the Beast.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.411
Brazil, damn it!

03:38.585 --> 03:40.687
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

03:41.221 --> 03:45.525
now it's Felipe Camargo's turn.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.540
-He reached the Point Thruster.
-Nice one!

04:34.575 --> 04:35.976
He did well!

04:58.599 --> 05:01.101
I can't look.

05:01.168 --> 05:04.137
Okay, I'll tell you what's happening.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.715
Let's go, Felipe!

05:14.781 --> 05:17.050
Attaboy!

05:18.886 --> 05:20.487
Did you see the fright?

06:52.379 --> 06:54.181
That's it!

07:04.624 --> 07:07.227
I passed this one, I got the bonuses.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.029
I'm happy. Let's go to the next one.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.549
The guy is 6'2" tall,

10:15.616 --> 10:18.085
weighs 198 pounds,
is American and handsome.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.054
He has to lose something in his life.
He only has wins so far.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.259
It's something words cannot explain.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.128
It's a great honor
to represent my country.

11:02.196 --> 11:04.698
I'd like to give it my all,
my strength and passion

11:04.764 --> 11:06.900
to bring glory to my country's name.

11:13.874 --> 11:18.712
Because I'm introverted,
I think people tend to underestimate me.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.713
<i>There's a lot of strength in me.</i>

11:20.780 --> 11:24.617
<i>It gets out, it gives everything,</i>
<i>and that surprises people sometimes.</i>

11:43.437 --> 11:46.907
-Come on, Roberto, brother!
-Don't scare me.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.876
-You're a brave one.
-That's it!

11:48.942 --> 11:50.610
-There you go. Easy.
-Good, Roberto!

12:09.196 --> 12:10.998
-Roberto barely made it!
-Wow...

12:11.064 --> 12:13.934
But he's still up there.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.966
-Well done, Roberto!
-Another ten points for my Roberto!

12:53.540 --> 12:55.909
-Yeah! That's it!
-My man Roberto is in!

12:55.975 --> 12:58.111
<i>Mexico, well done!</i>

13:04.083 --> 13:06.986
Well done, Roberto!
Thank you for these emotions, brother.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.324
Come on, with everything we got, Mexico!

13:32.312 --> 13:35.014
I'm the strongest
among all the contestants.

13:35.081 --> 13:41.721
<i>But having power</i>
<i>and climbing are two different things.</i>

13:41.788 --> 13:44.424
<i>But I'll do the best.</i>

13:44.490 --> 13:45.525
Go, Korea!

14:07.681 --> 14:10.217
-He grabbed it!
-He'll make it!

15:16.450 --> 15:20.220
I am highly motivated.
I will kick some ass. I did it once,

15:20.287 --> 15:22.489
and I will do it a second time.

15:25.626 --> 15:29.830
He cannot manage to reach
the Point Thruster with his foot.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.497
Shoot!

15:41.475 --> 15:44.344
He has to get
the Point Thruster this time!

15:54.721 --> 15:57.024
That was not a good jump.

15:57.089 --> 16:00.259
David Manthei fell.

16:29.957 --> 16:32.659
It feels good to compete for Germany.

16:32.726 --> 16:36.330
<i>I love my country and that gives me</i>
<i>the strength to win.</i>

17:23.276 --> 17:26.078
Phillip Meyer!

17:45.031 --> 17:48.534
-No.
-Not a good jump.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.836
I failed at the same obstacle again.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.675
I still wanted to try.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.877
<i>I just hope for the best.</i>

17:56.944 --> 17:58.879
I hope I made it to the next level.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.492
I'm proud of myself, yes.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.230
But I get to show how Korea is strong

18:16.295 --> 18:19.465
<i>to the whole world.</i>

18:20.667 --> 18:21.668
It's great.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.044
<i>I have a daughter.</i>

18:32.111 --> 18:34.947
<i>And I have one more on the way.</i>

18:35.015 --> 18:38.385
<i>My wife is 14 weeks along.</i>

18:38.851 --> 18:41.220
I'll do my best for my family.

18:41.622 --> 18:47.594
<i>My name is Heeyong Park, and I came here</i>
<i>to be the winner of </i>Ultimate Beastmaster<i>.</i>

19:22.496 --> 19:25.332
-I can't watch. It's too much.
-Me neither.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.586
-There you go!
-Yeah!

20:22.755 --> 20:25.624
Just sit back like you're at the movies.
Get comfortable.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.026
Park Heeyong!

21:07.067 --> 21:09.937
Park Heeyong!

21:11.038 --> 21:13.273
It feels great!

21:14.274 --> 21:15.275
I can do it!

23:42.422 --> 23:44.591
And both Germans are going home.

24:30.037 --> 24:32.439
And the German is out!

24:32.506 --> 24:34.274
-I can celebrate?
-Yes.

24:34.341 --> 24:36.276
-Just a little.
-Please, go ahead.

24:40.814 --> 24:43.483
The German is out.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.018
We have to pack our bags.

24:45.085 --> 24:48.188
Yes, our presenter job here is over.

25:17.484 --> 25:20.254
I just cannot believe this.

25:37.938 --> 25:39.406
Can we trust in you guys?

25:39.473 --> 25:41.708
-Felipe Camargo.
-Good!

25:41.775 --> 25:43.911
We are hereby adopting Felipe Camargo.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.813
One, two, three. Brazil!

26:01.193 --> 26:04.797
-Way to go, Park!
-Go, Park!

26:04.863 --> 26:11.770
What I'm worried about the most
is jumping to that spinning circle.

26:11.839 --> 26:14.241
<i>I'll just have to try.</i>

26:14.308 --> 26:18.345
I want to overcome that.

26:32.192 --> 26:33.961
-Good, good.
-Good.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.307
He's... up there!

26:48.308 --> 26:50.978
-Heeyong Park!
-Heeyong Park!

27:03.790 --> 27:04.791
Thanks!

28:22.970 --> 28:25.439
-A little more!
-He jumped!

29:19.092 --> 29:20.160
He scored!

30:15.380 --> 30:17.516
Let's go, Brazil!

30:27.895 --> 30:29.963
-That's great!
-Now let's go!

30:30.030 --> 30:31.865
That's great!

30:31.932 --> 30:34.334
Let's go!

30:49.883 --> 30:51.351
No...

30:51.418 --> 30:54.955
No!

30:58.358 --> 31:02.563
I'll have a heart attack.

35:43.210 --> 35:46.013
Kim Hyunho!

36:01.228 --> 36:03.864
-He grabbed it, but...
-He's climbing.

36:03.931 --> 36:07.267
-He made it!
-Incredible upper-body strength!

36:39.266 --> 36:42.302
My arms are...

36:42.734 --> 36:46.404
My body just gave out.

36:46.807 --> 36:49.343
<i>Everybody from Korea...</i>

36:49.409 --> 36:52.045
No, all the contestants worked hard
and did great.

36:52.343 --> 36:53.945
Thank you.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.320
The most complete competitor,
ranked number one as of right now.

37:23.010 --> 37:25.479
-There he goes!
-Well done!

37:25.546 --> 37:27.381
Go, Mexico!

37:59.410 --> 38:02.213
God, he jumped to the side,
my man Roberto!

38:02.280 --> 38:03.281
What happened?

38:03.348 --> 38:05.950
A bad jump, my Roberto.

38:22.836 --> 38:24.738
-Did you try too hard?
-God, yes.

38:24.805 --> 38:27.474
Well, I... I don't know,

38:27.541 --> 38:29.977
I guess I didn't measure
that jump so well.

38:30.043 --> 38:33.113
There was no way.
It was quickly turning and I...

38:33.180 --> 38:35.549
What a great run this guy showed us

38:35.613 --> 38:38.950
every time he went out there
and tried to conquer the Beast.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.653
I swear, I'm in shock.

38:41.719 --> 38:44.322
<i>I wasn't expecting that.</i>

38:44.789 --> 38:46.457
No, it's not possible.

39:41.479 --> 39:44.782
Felipe Camargo, our Brazilian,

39:44.849 --> 39:47.652
will begin Level 3.

40:25.192 --> 40:26.894
Let's go, Felipe.

40:32.599 --> 40:33.800
Let's go, Felipe.

40:34.866 --> 40:35.967
Let's go, Brazil!

41:11.502 --> 41:14.906
I don't want to see.
I'll go with the Americans.

41:34.993 --> 41:39.063
Let's go, Felipe! Let's go!

41:43.303 --> 41:47.574
Take it easy, Felipe. Take it easy.

42:57.175 --> 43:01.779
Felipe! Attaboy! It's first place!

43:03.817 --> 43:05.152
Nice one, Felipe!

43:09.122 --> 43:10.424
Brazil!

47:24.745 --> 47:28.248
Park Heeyong. A son of South Korea!

48:23.303 --> 48:25.439
Let's get in sync with Heeyong's body.

48:25.506 --> 48:26.840
Yes.

49:19.259 --> 49:21.495
Park Heeyong!

49:21.562 --> 49:22.863
Park Heeyong!

50:22.523 --> 50:24.491
-Stop!
-Save your energy!

50:57.824 --> 51:01.895
-He hooked his leg and...
-What is that?

51:17.177 --> 51:19.413
Park Heeyong!

51:21.148 --> 51:23.517
I made it! I made it!

51:54.945 --> 51:57.147
One hundred and eight athletes
were participating.

51:57.214 --> 51:58.449
All of them were great,

51:58.515 --> 52:02.019
and now there are two, the Korean and me.

52:02.486 --> 52:04.788
I know he's a great climber.

52:04.855 --> 52:07.491
<i>He's way better than me at rock climbing.</i>

52:07.591 --> 52:11.362
<i>But I'm better at ice climbing.</i>

52:11.895 --> 52:14.331
The Korean is also very good.

52:14.398 --> 52:18.135
<i>He is a climber, he was a world champion</i>
<i>in ice climbing.</i>

52:18.205 --> 52:21.008
I think it's going to be neck-and-neck.

52:21.505 --> 52:24.341
It's going to be great.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.076
Let's go. Brazil!

52:26.877 --> 52:28.045
Go, Korea Team!

52:28.115 --> 52:30.384
<i>Let's go! Let the competition begin!</i>

52:30.450 --> 52:33.053
Now is the time. Let's go, Felipe.

52:33.120 --> 52:37.090
Parkour... great comeback of a veteran!

53:07.184 --> 53:12.456
He was a little behind,
but he's closing the gap.

53:21.832 --> 53:24.201
Let's go, Felipe! Let's go!

53:24.268 --> 53:25.869
Let's go, bro!

53:47.528 --> 53:49.796
-Let's go, Felipe!
-Let's go, Felipe!

53:49.863 --> 53:51.932
-Climb, Felipe!
-Let's go, Felipe!

53:59.039 --> 54:01.175
Look at that.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.874
You can see Heeyong is way ahead.

54:04.278 --> 54:07.247
Felipe is tired.

54:16.523 --> 54:19.259
The Beastmaster...

54:19.326 --> 54:20.994
...Park Heeyong from Korea.

54:21.061 --> 54:23.030
Look at that! The opponent is tired.

54:23.096 --> 54:24.631
<i>Heeyong can take a break.</i>

54:48.622 --> 54:53.227
He has a strategy.
Once Felipe approaches...

54:53.690 --> 54:56.093
-Let's go, Felipe!
-Pull over there, Felipe!

54:56.163 --> 54:58.432
-Heeyong is...
-Now he's...

56:07.668 --> 56:09.803
-It's begun!
-It's time!

56:09.870 --> 56:12.506
-Let's go, Felipe!
-Let's go, Felipe!

56:19.743 --> 56:22.913
-It's not easy now!
-Felipe is...

56:32.890 --> 56:34.391
He was faster before.

56:50.911 --> 56:52.980
Felipe!

56:53.046 --> 56:54.815
Brazil!

57:40.460 --> 57:43.397
There was only one Brazilian
in the big final,

57:43.994 --> 57:46.129
and I managed to win this for Brazil.

57:46.800 --> 57:51.038
First edition of <i>Ultimate Beastmaster.</i>
Brazil!
