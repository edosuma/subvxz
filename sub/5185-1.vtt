MagnaVolt.
The final word in auto security.

01:05.637 --> 01:09.368
No embarrassing alarm noise,
no need to trouble the police...

01:15.683 --> 01:18.413
...and it won't even
run down your battery.

01:20.226 --> 01:21.716
<i>MagnaVolt.</i>

01:22.114 --> 01:24.674
<i>Lethal response.</i>

01:25.378 --> 01:29.678
<i>On the international scene, the Amazon
nuclear power facility has blown its stack...</i>

01:29.697 --> 01:34.225
...irradiating the world's largest rain forest.
Environmentalists call it a disaster.

01:34.241 --> 01:36.232
But don't they always?

01:36.352 --> 01:39.219
In national news,
Attorney General Marcos today...

01:39.296 --> 01:44.233
...approved the ED 209 combat unit
for deployment in five American cities...

01:44.224 --> 01:47.284
...despite widespread complaints
of malfunction.

01:47.359 --> 01:48.792
The surgeon general is dead.

01:48.926 --> 01:53.056
Gunned down 20 minutes ago by a militant
addict of the deadly designer drug Nuke.

01:53.086 --> 01:57.216
The greatest health threat
facing our nation.

02:02.014 --> 02:03.242
Nuke.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.744
The most addictive narcotic
in history.

02:06.812 --> 02:09.007
A plague that...

02:14.588 --> 02:16.556
Nuke! Nuke!

02:19.963 --> 02:23.194
This station has just received
this transmission from Cain...

02:23.226 --> 02:26.218
...convicted murderer
and leader of the Nuke cult.

02:26.266 --> 02:27.563
The people want paradise.

02:30.713 --> 02:31.975
And they will have it.

02:32.121 --> 02:35.386
<i>The assassination is the latest
act of terrorism by Cain...</i>

02:35.449 --> 02:40.079
<i>...following the bombing
of a drug treatment clinic that left five dead.</i>

02:40.088 --> 02:44.718
After the latest breakdown in negotiations,
Detroit's police returned to the picket line...

02:44.695 --> 02:48.290
...demanding better terms from
Omni Consumer Products, OCP...

02:48.343 --> 02:52.177
...the corporation contracted by the city
to run the police department.

02:52.214 --> 02:56.583
OCP cut our salaries 40 percent
and canceled our pensions.

02:56.597 --> 02:59.225
Now they refuse to even talk to us.

02:59.286 --> 03:01.481
God knows why,
but they want this strike.

03:38.193 --> 03:39.820
What happened?

04:08.365 --> 04:09.992
Get up!

04:11.149 --> 04:14.482
- Hold him!
- You put my eye out, you bitches!

04:14.541 --> 04:16.475
Shut up, you fuckhead!

04:16.908 --> 04:19.934
- You're breaking my fucking arm!
- Hurry!

04:22.316 --> 04:24.648
Look at this. What a nasty man.

04:24.747 --> 04:28.615
Night's made. Let's pay Papa
and get us what we need.

04:28.650 --> 04:30.413
Nuke me, baby!

04:31.594 --> 04:35.325
- I'll kill you bitches!
- He's up! Come on!

04:39.498 --> 04:43.195
- You're shit with a timer, man!
- Come on! Let's go!

04:52.168 --> 04:54.762
I'll take out an army with this shit!

04:56.998 --> 04:59.398
Let's load up
and get the hell out of here!

05:06.918 --> 05:09.352
Where's the bullets for this gun, man?

05:10.053 --> 05:12.248
Third drawer, bottom.

05:26.307 --> 05:28.468
We should've brought a truck!

05:35.266 --> 05:36.824
I really like this gun, man.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.429
Just take it and get out.

05:38.625 --> 05:39.853
Thanks.

05:44.001 --> 05:46.094
- I don't believe this!
- What?

05:46.208 --> 05:48.904
- It's the cops, man.
- Cops are on strike, stupid.

05:48.993 --> 05:50.961
Can't you hear that?

05:59.934 --> 06:03.097
- See. What did I tell you?
- I'll fix him.

06:14.653 --> 06:16.621
Did you see that? We got him!

06:17.020 --> 06:20.717
- Beautiful. Come on, man. Let's move it.
- No. One more!

06:22.268 --> 06:24.668
Nice shit, man.

06:25.307 --> 06:27.172
Fucking cops!

07:19.061 --> 07:20.289
Peace officer.

07:22.388 --> 07:23.616
Think it over, creep.

07:37.042 --> 07:38.634
Nuke.

07:40.082 --> 07:42.016
It's not mine, man.

07:42.482 --> 07:45.315
Where is it made?

07:45.393 --> 07:48.453
It's not mine, man. I told you! I'm clean!

07:50.576 --> 07:53.773
Where is it made?

07:54.609 --> 07:58.101
I don't know, man!
All I know is where I get it!

10:14.527 --> 10:16.222
Freeze.

10:16.319 --> 10:19.186
Nobody move. This is a bust.

10:38.492 --> 10:40.153
Ladies, stay down.

11:41.332 --> 11:44.426
Somebody! Open the fridge, damn it!

11:46.131 --> 11:47.598
Come on!

12:10.671 --> 12:12.605
Can't shoot a kid, can you, fucker?

12:21.870 --> 12:23.132
<i>Can't shoot a kid...</i>

12:24.334 --> 12:26.325
<i>Throw it home, Dad!</i>

12:36.748 --> 12:38.215
Shut up!

12:39.020 --> 12:43.548
Drop it or the little shit's dead!
I'll blow its fucking head off, man!

12:43.563 --> 12:45.224
Lewis...

12:45.323 --> 12:47.120
...hang it up.

12:54.410 --> 12:56.275
Now, no shit from either one of you!

12:56.394 --> 12:58.362
- And don't try to follow me!
- We won't.

12:58.474 --> 12:59.964
The baby's going with me!

13:00.106 --> 13:02.904
I'll kill it, man. I'll do it. I'll fucking kill it!

13:02.986 --> 13:05.181
We can't have that.

13:17.799 --> 13:19.323
Nice shooting.

13:22.567 --> 13:24.159
See you, Jimmy.

13:40.389 --> 13:41.651
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

14:15.391 --> 14:19.088
Don't do it! No! Stop... Stop it, Alex!

14:42.076 --> 14:45.273
<i>OCP defines you as a machine...</i>

14:45.980 --> 14:50.542
...that utilizes some living tissue.
You understand that.

14:50.747 --> 14:52.442
Yes.

14:53.307 --> 14:57.835
And so do you
consider yourself human?

15:00.314 --> 15:01.713
I require an answer.

15:03.418 --> 15:05.283
Stop tape.

15:07.064 --> 15:10.261
You have any idea what you're doing
to that poor woman?

15:11.385 --> 15:13.114
Take a look at her file.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.605
Go on.

15:14.937 --> 15:19.738
Officer, Mrs. Murphy
is bringing suit against OCP.

15:19.767 --> 15:22.292
My name is Tom Delaney.
I'm representing her.

15:22.391 --> 15:25.588
Up to a few months ago,
she wouldn't leave her bedroom.

15:25.655 --> 15:28.453
Then there were hypnotists
and harmonic treatments.

15:28.535 --> 15:32.437
Then you pull this shit!
Driving past her house day after day.

15:32.470 --> 15:35.962
Spying on her. Trying to make her
think her husband is still alive.

15:36.021 --> 15:38.785
She's barely started
to accept the loss.

15:38.965 --> 15:42.162
- You're ripping her to pieces.
- And for what?

15:42.773 --> 15:45.435
Do you think you could ever be
a husband to her?

15:46.484 --> 15:49.044
I mean, what can you offer her?

15:49.299 --> 15:51.164
Companionship?

15:53.108 --> 15:54.439
Love?

15:55.475 --> 15:57.443
A man's love?

16:12.465 --> 16:13.762
No.

16:15.440 --> 16:16.964
Roll tape.

16:21.712 --> 16:23.373
Are you Alex Murphy?

16:25.775 --> 16:27.208
No.

16:27.343 --> 16:28.640
Are you human?

16:29.742 --> 16:31.209
No.

16:31.631 --> 16:33.895
You are simply a machine.

16:35.310 --> 16:37.141
I am...

16:37.806 --> 16:39.296
...a machine.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.262
Nothing more.

16:41.773 --> 16:43.604
Nothing more.

16:47.148 --> 16:49.048
That'll do it. Stop tape.

16:52.524 --> 16:55.823
Now, you stay there.
All right, go get her.

16:55.884 --> 16:58.978
Let's be decent about this.
Give them some privacy.

16:59.595 --> 17:01.893
I don't have a problem with that.

17:53.636 --> 17:55.331
Alex?

17:55.651 --> 17:57.619
Don't you know me?

18:01.091 --> 18:03.116
Don't you remember me?

18:05.443 --> 18:08.537
Alex, it doesn't matter
what they've done to you...

18:09.890 --> 18:11.517
Touch me.

18:20.737 --> 18:21.965
It's cold.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.687
They made this...

18:24.800 --> 18:26.563
...to honor him.

18:29.279 --> 18:33.978
- No, I...
- Your husband is dead.

18:36.415 --> 18:37.905
I don't know you.

19:04.155 --> 19:06.146
Why is this happening?

19:21.945 --> 19:25.346
I thought all communication systems
were the same.

19:25.656 --> 19:28.523
I tried to save the company
a few bucks.

19:28.920 --> 19:33.084
It took two days to download specs
from Cleveland.

19:34.679 --> 19:36.613
I lost the account.

19:59.604 --> 20:02.664
It hardly befits my dignity
to have to come to you, Johnson.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.334
Sorry for the slight inconvenience,
Your Honor.

20:05.428 --> 20:07.658
Twenty minutes in rush hour isn't slight.

20:07.763 --> 20:09.754
Not when you're mayor of a major city!

20:09.875 --> 20:13.470
When will you start paying the cops
so they'll go back to work?

20:13.522 --> 20:15.251
We're not a charity.

20:15.378 --> 20:17.573
The city owes us over $37 million.

20:17.682 --> 20:21.140
- You'll have to cut us some slack.
- A deadline's a deadline. Sorry.

20:21.201 --> 20:23.635
How are we supposed to raise
that kind of money?

20:23.729 --> 20:25.390
You aren't.

20:25.969 --> 20:29.405
- What the hell is he talking about?
- We don't expect you to pay.

20:29.457 --> 20:31.687
Let me refer you to our contract.

20:33.391 --> 20:34.858
"In the event of default...

20:34.991 --> 20:39.690
...OCP shall have the uncontested right
of foreclosure on all city assets."

20:41.935 --> 20:43.425
You signed this.

20:43.727 --> 20:46.321
We miss one payment,
and you can foreclose?

20:46.414 --> 20:48.211
We can and we will.

20:48.494 --> 20:50.655
We're taking Detroit private.

20:50.830 --> 20:53.298
So you deliberately undermined
our credit.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.546
That was the easy part.

20:56.365 --> 20:58.765
And you engineered the police strike.

20:58.860 --> 21:01.055
You want Detroit to tear itself apart...

21:01.133 --> 21:04.102
...so you can raid it like you would
any other corporation!

21:04.139 --> 21:06.198
Do you know how many people
are dying?

21:06.315 --> 21:07.543
You're murderers!

21:07.660 --> 21:10.561
I'd advise you to say nothing further.
It might be...

21:10.603 --> 21:11.831
...actionable.

21:11.947 --> 21:13.539
It's bullshit!

21:13.867 --> 21:16.802
- Bullshit, you senile, old bastard!
- All right, calm down.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.935
- We better get out of here.
- I'm okay!

21:19.018 --> 21:21.077
- Calm down. We better leave.
- I'm calm.

21:21.194 --> 21:23.287
- Calm down. Easy.
- I'm okay.

21:23.401 --> 21:24.698
All right, good.

21:24.809 --> 21:27.801
- I'm in control. Everything is fine. It's okay.
- Relax.

21:28.169 --> 21:29.761
I'm fine.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.831
One last thing, gentlemen.

21:31.944 --> 21:33.571
We will sue your asses.

21:33.704 --> 21:35.535
Give it your best shot.

21:35.656 --> 21:39.353
Fuck you, you old, senile bastard!
This is bullshit!

21:39.400 --> 21:40.992
Fuck you!

21:41.127 --> 21:43.595
- This is bullshit!
- Calm down.

21:47.367 --> 21:51.167
I've been very patient, Johnson.
Five months.

21:51.942 --> 21:53.910
- Who's that?
- That's Dr. Juliette Faxx.

21:53.990 --> 21:56.515
Just moved up to head the
Attitude Adjustment team.

21:56.613 --> 22:00.549
Five months. Ninety million dollars!

22:02.212 --> 22:06.205
- I want to see some results.
- Yes, sir. I'll show you what we have.

22:07.747 --> 22:10.375
<i>OCP pioneered cyborg technology.</i>

22:10.468 --> 22:13.096
<i>And now we take
a quantum leap forward.</i>

22:13.187 --> 22:15.417
<i>State-of-the-art
destructive capabilities...</i>

22:15.523 --> 22:20.222
<i>...commanded by a unique combination
of software and organic systems.</i>

22:20.194 --> 22:22.594
<i>In every way,
an improvement over the original.</i>

22:22.914 --> 22:27.214
<i>It gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you, Robocop 2.</i>

22:37.536 --> 22:40.334
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

22:41.728 --> 22:43.923
<i>Stop or I'll shoot.</i>

22:44.863 --> 22:47.457
<i>Stop or I'll shoot.</i>

22:55.741 --> 22:59.905
<i>OCP is proud to present the future
of urban pacification:</i>

22:59.932 --> 23:01.559
<i>Robocop 2.</i>

23:19.259 --> 23:21.489
Ninety million.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.571
They all go crazy.

23:25.691 --> 23:28.023
Robots with emotional problems.

23:28.121 --> 23:30.555
No, sir, not robots, cyborgs.

23:30.648 --> 23:34.880
Cybernetic organisms. We use living human
tissue and that's our whole problem.

23:34.873 --> 23:37.933
The candidates were all fine men,
respected police officers.

23:37.975 --> 23:39.943
I reviewed their files myself.

23:40.056 --> 23:44.459
Sir, police officers may not be
the best candidates for our purposes.

23:44.439 --> 23:47.067
They're a physical bunch.
They're macho, body-proud.

23:47.127 --> 23:50.585
Stripped of all that it's no wonder
they become suicidal.

23:50.647 --> 23:52.808
Our one success was a cop.

23:52.919 --> 23:55.353
Well, yes, Mr. Johnson. Alex Murphy.

23:55.446 --> 23:58.381
Top of his class,
devout Irish Catholic, family man.

23:58.454 --> 24:01.582
Everything in his profile
indicates a fierce sense of duty.

24:01.621 --> 24:03.452
That's probably what kept him alive.

24:03.541 --> 24:07.272
With due respect, Dr. Faxx,
your area of expertise is psychology.

24:07.317 --> 24:08.648
Not robotics.

24:08.788 --> 24:11.848
There's no harm in hearing
the young lady out, is there?

24:11.892 --> 24:13.120
No, sir.

24:13.235 --> 24:17.194
Thank you, sir. I believe that Murphy's case
was unusual but not unique.

24:17.235 --> 24:21.672
We can find someone else, someone
to whom the prospect might even be...

24:21.682 --> 24:23.013
...desirable.

24:24.466 --> 24:27.230
I've never met anyone who wanted
to be a robot.

24:27.441 --> 24:31.241
It would require a screening process,
one I'd would be happy to supervise.

24:31.281 --> 24:32.908
The cost would be negligible.

24:34.481 --> 24:37.450
It would be a shame
to waste all the work that's been done.

24:37.488 --> 24:39.319
It certainly would.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.408
Go to it. Report to me directly.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.025
Yes, sir.

24:44.944 --> 24:47.811
You could learn a thing or two
from that girl, Johnson.

24:52.206 --> 24:54.174
- not for me!

24:54.287 --> 24:58.314
Decent pay to decent cops!

25:02.509 --> 25:06.138
Union's got a list!
We ain't forgetting who you are!

25:06.189 --> 25:07.679
One at a time!

25:10.636 --> 25:13.332
Please, one at a time.

25:16.524 --> 25:19.118
Don't you know
what's going on out here?

25:21.451 --> 25:22.816
It's the best we can do!

25:23.499 --> 25:26.195
Hello, ladies!

25:30.570 --> 25:32.902
They won't be fucking
with any more cops!

25:33.002 --> 25:35.493
They won't be fucking
with nobody, man!

26:11.269 --> 26:14.363
Hob. That's him.

26:16.453 --> 26:17.920
Thank you.

26:21.764 --> 26:23.288
Nuke me!

26:27.043 --> 26:28.977
Go ahead. Take two.

26:29.858 --> 26:31.917
There's plenty of Nuke to go around.

26:33.506 --> 26:35.030
I've lost him.

26:35.138 --> 26:36.901
You haven't been around in a while.

26:36.994 --> 26:39.155
Go ahead. This one's on me.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.631
Five degrees south-southwest.

26:42.081 --> 26:43.878
There's the little darling.

26:44.129 --> 26:45.357
Good eyes, Murphy.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.563
Good as money can buy.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.375
Ferdy, you got out.

26:49.856 --> 26:51.824
Well, I'll tell Cain, okay?

27:01.470 --> 27:04.166
Better have something
to give me this time, officer.

27:06.654 --> 27:10.351
One cop per car.
Okay, these are the routes.

27:10.845 --> 27:12.813
Three cars.

27:12.926 --> 27:14.689
- One cop per car?
- That's right.

27:14.812 --> 27:19.078
Sitting ducks. We set up three
snipers and that's all it takes.

27:20.253 --> 27:22.778
- Pay the man.
- All right.

27:22.843 --> 27:24.071
Thank you.

27:24.219 --> 27:26.312
- You didn't count it.
- That's all right.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.418
You should really count it, you know.

27:28.539 --> 27:29.870
It's okay.

27:30.010 --> 27:33.036
Give him something
to help him with his conscience.

27:36.025 --> 27:38.357
No, that's all right. I don't really want it.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.756
Come on, Duffy. I know you need it.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.253
Isn't this a school day?

28:06.102 --> 28:07.729
Cops!

28:10.294 --> 28:11.818
Oh, shit!

28:19.636 --> 28:20.625
Oh, no.

28:38.386 --> 28:39.853
Freeze!

28:40.498 --> 28:43.023
Turn around. Put your hands up.

28:57.935 --> 28:58.924
Shit.

29:12.686 --> 29:15.382
Officer Duffy, have a seat.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.952
You look a little out of breath, bitch.

29:26.668 --> 29:31.628
- You sold us out, Officer Duffy.
- What are you talking about, Murph?

29:31.596 --> 29:34.292
Where is Cain?

29:34.346 --> 29:37.008
I don't know any Cain.

29:38.954 --> 29:41.047
Where is Cain?

29:41.161 --> 29:43.493
I don't know.

29:50.185 --> 29:52.551
Where is Cain?!

29:52.649 --> 29:55.083
I told you, I don't know!

30:17.574 --> 30:19.565
Where?

30:19.653 --> 30:22.178
River Rouge. The old sludge plant.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.597
You're a rotten cop.

33:10.736 --> 33:12.203
Go.

34:20.902 --> 34:23.632
- You.
- You want me?

34:23.717 --> 34:25.344
Dead or alive.

34:27.174 --> 34:28.436
Then one of us must die.

34:29.254 --> 34:30.812
Dead, then.

34:53.603 --> 34:55.366
Jesus...

34:55.458 --> 34:57.517
...had days like this.

34:58.626 --> 35:01.288
Hounded and attacked like a criminal.

35:01.633 --> 35:04.568
But like him, I don't blame you.

35:04.641 --> 35:07.201
They program you, and you do it.

35:07.744 --> 35:12.443
- I will kill you.
- Oh, you just tried.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.090
And...

35:15.199 --> 35:16.496
...I forgive you.

36:26.167 --> 36:28.032
Why'd you stop? You got it cracked.

36:28.118 --> 36:29.346
I'm tired.

36:29.814 --> 36:32.248
They say he's got a brain.
I want to see it.

36:37.748 --> 36:40.239
You think it was me that beat you?

36:40.437 --> 36:42.268
It wasn't.

36:42.772 --> 36:44.069
It was this.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.464
It's too tough.

37:01.842 --> 37:03.969
Try here at the joint.

37:09.584 --> 37:10.812
Yeah!

37:15.056 --> 37:16.683
Look at that!

37:25.871 --> 37:27.964
Come on. Cut it out.

37:30.639 --> 37:32.664
How's it taste?

37:44.429 --> 37:45.862
What the hell's going on?!

37:46.828 --> 37:48.819
Man, just look at him.

37:50.732 --> 37:52.597
Christ, he's been stripped.

38:04.906 --> 38:08.706
Let's not get carried away here.
We're talking about a piece of equipment.

38:08.745 --> 38:10.975
Don't tell me he can't suffer.

38:11.433 --> 38:13.128
Just look at him.

38:13.545 --> 38:15.775
It's electrical.

38:15.881 --> 38:17.542
Bullshit.

38:17.832 --> 38:20.596
I know every inch of him.
Every circuit.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.614
Every living nerve.

38:22.727 --> 38:26.663
His pain centers are alive.
They're lit up like Christmas trees.

38:26.696 --> 38:29.563
The back-up generator's
just making him twitch.

38:29.639 --> 38:31.129
He's suffering.

38:31.783 --> 38:33.114
How long can he last?

38:33.255 --> 38:34.916
No way of knowing.

38:35.334 --> 38:37.666
Got him on minimal life support.

38:38.694 --> 38:41.754
Keeping the brain going
with microshocks.

38:43.045 --> 38:47.414
- It's damn tricky. He could go anytime.
- Move. Move!

38:48.836 --> 38:50.235
What's happening in here?

38:50.371 --> 38:54.831
OCP is happening. These bastards
won't lift a finger to help him.

38:54.852 --> 38:57.719
This unit needs
millions of dollars in parts.

38:57.764 --> 39:01.757
You can't expect authorization for that
kind of cash overnight. Be reasonable.

39:01.794 --> 39:03.523
If you don't fix him, it's murder.

39:03.650 --> 39:06.448
Settle down. I'm doing you
a favor by talking to you.

39:06.914 --> 39:10.077
You son of a bitch. He's in hell.

39:13.121 --> 39:14.486
Fix him!

39:15.810 --> 39:17.368
We'll be in touch.

39:24.929 --> 39:27.295
Oh, man, you guys are the greatest!

39:27.392 --> 39:29.326
Did you see their faces?

39:29.440 --> 39:32.534
"We're gonna throw away
the key, Duffy."

39:34.271 --> 39:36.569
The cops didn't give you trouble,
did they?

39:36.639 --> 39:40.370
The usual shit from Reed.
They'll never prove anything.

39:40.701 --> 39:41.963
Hey, want some?

39:42.110 --> 39:45.477
Hey, I'm a minor.
Don't want to break any laws.

39:46.365 --> 39:47.889
Here, you take it.

39:48.029 --> 39:50.293
God, I just love you guys!

39:54.717 --> 39:56.207
What happened?

39:56.924 --> 39:58.357
Hey, where we going?

39:58.939 --> 40:01.965
Hey, come on, guys.
This isn't funny, man.

40:02.044 --> 40:03.739
Oh, God, my head.

40:04.027 --> 40:06.996
My head is killing me.

40:08.026 --> 40:09.823
Hey, man. What's...?

40:09.914 --> 40:13.372
Hey, Cain! Hey, it's good to see you.

40:13.434 --> 40:14.992
Thanks for getting me out.

40:16.602 --> 40:19.002
- I can't get up.
- You noticed that one.

40:19.066 --> 40:22.593
- Cain, I don't know what the kid told you...
- You told them, Duffy.

40:22.617 --> 40:24.949
- You told them where we were.
- That's not true.

40:25.017 --> 40:29.784
- We know all about it, Duffy.
- You think you're the only cop we have?

40:32.120 --> 40:33.712
Oh, shit!

40:34.136 --> 40:36.468
Cain. Cain, come on.
Man, I'm begging you, man!

40:36.534 --> 40:38.866
Look, I'll do anything!

40:39.127 --> 40:41.925
Okay. You're kidding, right?
Yeah, you're just kidding.

40:42.230 --> 40:46.064
You scared me.
You taught me a lesson, man.

40:46.102 --> 40:49.299
I'd never fuck with you,
because I really love you guys.

40:49.333 --> 40:51.324
- I really do!
- Shut up!

40:51.445 --> 40:55.711
I've been loyal. I know shit
that I still haven't even told you, Cain!

40:57.045 --> 40:59.980
You deserve this, Duffy.
Cain might have been killed.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.351
Okay. Okay.

41:01.556 --> 41:04.150
Maybe you ought to have the kid leave.

41:04.883 --> 41:08.478
- Why?
- What do you mean, "have the kid leave"?

41:09.107 --> 41:13.134
That's a good touch. That's a good touch.
"Have the kid leave."

41:14.930 --> 41:17.558
That's good. "Have the kid leave." Why?

41:18.994 --> 41:21.622
Come on. It's over.

41:21.874 --> 41:25.105
Come on, Cain! Come on, man.
What are you doing?

41:26.577 --> 41:28.101
Come on!

41:42.319 --> 41:45.083
You said you were
just gonna scare him!

41:45.166 --> 41:47.134
Doesn't he look scared?

41:57.293 --> 41:59.090
I can't believe you'd do this.

41:59.213 --> 42:02.148
It hardly matters what you believe,
Mr. Schenk.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.984
But these are criminals.
They're maniacs.

42:05.068 --> 42:08.094
You're giving premature
value judgments.

42:09.259 --> 42:12.695
All right, it may be true.
The subjects are socially misaligned.

42:12.747 --> 42:15.682
Socially misaligned?
These are death row inmates!

42:15.722 --> 42:19.317
And of no use to society. We need a
subject who'll welcome the power...

42:19.338 --> 42:21.203
...the virtual immortality we offer.

42:21.322 --> 42:25.088
Now, I really think this is a good place
to start looking.

42:26.537 --> 42:30.633
- You're out of your mind.
- Is that your professional opinion?

42:31.113 --> 42:33.513
Yes, goddamn it, it is! Yes!

42:33.608 --> 42:37.977
And you are not using my lab to put
that kind of a brain into my cyborg.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.825
We'd dearly miss you here.

42:41.831 --> 42:44.231
You're the one that's gonna be
out of a job.

42:44.967 --> 42:47.629
I'm going to take this directly
to Johnson.

42:48.677 --> 42:52.306
He's just been waiting for an excuse
to get you fired.

43:00.069 --> 43:01.366
Good morning, sir.

43:02.533 --> 43:04.797
I'm sorry to bother you this early.

43:06.211 --> 43:07.542
You seem agitated.

43:07.683 --> 43:09.878
Frankly, I'm shocked.

43:10.276 --> 43:11.868
Mr. Schenk just called.

43:11.971 --> 43:15.600
Dr. Faxx has begun screening
candidates for the Robocop 2 project...

43:15.651 --> 43:19.314
So I understand. It's very exciting.

43:19.394 --> 43:22.329
She's screening psychotics, sir.
Murderers.

43:22.402 --> 43:25.269
We aren't planning to build a toy,
Johnson.

43:25.313 --> 43:26.746
Faxx knows what she's doing.

43:26.881 --> 43:30.612
She's keeping Robocop offline.
It's a public-relations disaster.

43:31.009 --> 43:34.501
You've got to learn to look
at the larger picture. The foreclosure.

43:34.529 --> 43:36.622
You must know how important
that is to us.

43:36.704 --> 43:40.538
With Robocop out of commission, the
chaos down there will increase...

43:40.608 --> 43:43.270
...and the odds the city will fall
into our hands.

43:43.327 --> 43:47.923
But a competent executive would find a way
to deal with the corporate image problem.

43:47.935 --> 43:50.495
Couldn't agree with you more,
Mr. Johnson.

43:51.581 --> 43:53.549
Fortunately, I have found a way.

43:53.662 --> 43:57.154
Yes, Ms. Faxx and I have
already discussed it.

43:58.205 --> 44:01.834
I know you'll help
to implement her ideas.

44:02.045 --> 44:03.740
Of course, sir. Whatever I can do.

44:03.837 --> 44:05.065
Anything else?

44:05.468 --> 44:08.266
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

44:08.380 --> 44:11.008
Don't forget your shoes
on the way out.

44:42.679 --> 44:45.204
He's my patient and critical.
I must stay with him.

44:45.272 --> 44:47.103
We'll let you know when we need you.

44:47.191 --> 44:50.251
Nobody on your staff has my experience
with him. You need me.

44:50.327 --> 44:51.794
We don't need anybody.

44:51.927 --> 44:55.158
"We." Who the hell are "we"?
You're a lawyer who knows nothing!

44:55.222 --> 44:57.918
You're exactly this far
from getting fired, babe.

44:58.454 --> 45:00.183
Shyster!

45:01.237 --> 45:02.898
He's one of mine.

45:03.510 --> 45:05.478
I want him back on his feet.

45:05.973 --> 45:09.204
Maybe he will be,
or maybe we'll just sell the parts for scrap.

45:09.269 --> 45:10.930
That's up to us.

45:11.028 --> 45:13.394
You see, Robocop's off warranty.

45:16.948 --> 45:18.540
Robocop's command program...

45:18.675 --> 45:22.042
...his set of directives...

45:22.099 --> 45:26.331
It determines his behavior.
It's time to update the program...

45:26.353 --> 45:30.016
...and I would like to hear
from each one of you.

45:31.217 --> 45:33.151
It's about time they asked us.

45:33.266 --> 45:36.292
We're getting a lot of heat
from parents' groups.

45:36.337 --> 45:38.601
Personally, I don't blame them.
I'm a parent.

45:38.992 --> 45:40.755
All that destructive behavior.

45:41.264 --> 45:43.858
He's become a role model
for our children.

45:43.952 --> 45:46.512
- Now, what are we teaching them?
- You have a point.

45:46.608 --> 45:49.839
If he talked things out with people
instead of firing that gun.

45:50.383 --> 45:53.682
Couldn't he take a little time
to address environmental issues?

45:53.711 --> 45:54.769
What was that?

45:54.894 --> 45:57.260
He could speak out
on environmental issues.

45:57.358 --> 45:58.848
Don't see any reason why not.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.548
For all the shooting he does...

46:00.653 --> 46:03.918
...I've never once seen him take the time
to do anything nice...

46:04.525 --> 46:08.325
...like visit an orphanage.
- You're absolutely right.

46:08.365 --> 46:09.889
Or help a cat out of a tree...

46:09.997 --> 46:12.659
...or go door to door collecting
for the Red Cross...

46:12.748 --> 46:17.412
...or maybe even roasting some
marshmallows with some Cub Scouts.

46:17.420 --> 46:22.722
Why, Mr. Johnson, that is wonderful.
Thank you so much.

46:27.675 --> 46:30.701
- It's no good. The program isn't uploading.
- He's resisting.

46:30.747 --> 46:31.975
There's too much data.

46:32.091 --> 46:36.255
- No, it's him. Leave him to me, Schenk.
- I can't... It's not going to work!

46:37.498 --> 46:39.159
You're wasting valuable time.

46:39.482 --> 46:42.110
- Don't resist us.
- Let me up.

46:42.681 --> 46:44.444
I must go.

46:46.168 --> 46:47.465
Go where?

46:48.504 --> 46:53.100
Do what? Go dancing? Fall in love?
What is it you think you are?

46:53.464 --> 46:55.125
Alex Murphy.

46:56.631 --> 46:57.962
That's a delusion.

46:58.359 --> 47:02.090
It's a glitch in your system.
Alex Murphy is dead.

47:02.135 --> 47:05.662
Take away the metal and wires,
you're just a couple chunks on a table.

47:05.718 --> 47:07.777
You're not even a corpse.

47:10.070 --> 47:11.367
What are you?

47:13.749 --> 47:15.080
Respond.

47:16.117 --> 47:19.644
I am Officer Alex Murphy...

47:19.700 --> 47:21.258
...Detroit Police Department.

47:21.396 --> 47:22.863
That won't do.

47:29.652 --> 47:31.313
What are you?

47:33.652 --> 47:37.486
Robocop. Crime Prevention Unit.

47:37.745 --> 47:39.144
OCP.

47:39.634 --> 47:41.898
Better. Much better.

47:45.554 --> 47:46.816
I type it. You think it.

47:47.633 --> 47:50.295
You type it. I think it.

47:50.768 --> 47:53.601
What a wonderful opportunity
you represent.

47:54.032 --> 47:56.398
Psychotherapy, it's such a...

47:57.167 --> 48:01.627
It's a slow, clumsy practice.
But with you this is so simple.

48:01.647 --> 48:03.342
Direct.

48:10.254 --> 48:11.516
You're lucky.

48:11.662 --> 48:15.530
We can do in moments with you what
would take years with a human patient.

48:16.492 --> 48:18.756
I'm really very lucky.

48:18.861 --> 48:23.093
You're free. You're free from doubt.
Free from having to make painful choices.

48:25.069 --> 48:26.696
I am free.

48:27.628 --> 48:29.255
He's ready.

48:30.539 --> 48:32.336
Uploading command program.

48:35.628 --> 48:38.825
I am so glad we had this chance
to dialogue.

48:49.737 --> 48:52.262
Look at you. It's like you're brand-new.

48:52.361 --> 48:53.726
Thank you. Thank you.

48:53.832 --> 48:55.891
You really had us worried there, Murphy.

48:55.977 --> 48:57.308
I'm touched.

48:57.448 --> 48:59.143
Get this guy.

48:59.847 --> 49:01.280
He's touched.

49:02.184 --> 49:06.177
That's enough. All of you,
back to your posts. Come on. Let's go.

49:09.639 --> 49:11.072
How you feeling, Murphy?

49:11.206 --> 49:14.733
I'm just fine, Warren.
Thank you for asking.

49:15.366 --> 49:16.924
Let's get you downstairs.

49:17.062 --> 49:20.429
I want to see what those amateurs
at OCP screwed up.

49:20.550 --> 49:23.849
Pity. It's a beautiful morning.

49:24.356 --> 49:25.948
Shame to waste it.

49:27.813 --> 49:29.974
- Ready for duty, partner?
- You betcha.

49:30.084 --> 49:32.575
- Let's go.
- Nothing I'd rather do.

49:34.532 --> 49:36.159
He sounds terrific.

49:36.291 --> 49:37.815
Something's wrong.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.218
Harder!

50:17.438 --> 50:20.305
It's Robo!
Everybody out the back door!

50:22.590 --> 50:24.717
- It's locked!
- It won't open!

50:29.085 --> 50:31.053
Murph, wake up, will you?

50:38.747 --> 50:40.510
Good morning.

50:45.371 --> 50:47.339
Come on, take him out.

50:52.281 --> 50:54.306
I think we should talk.

50:57.849 --> 51:00.010
What's with you, Murph?

51:07.064 --> 51:09.362
- Where'd they go?
- "Where'd they go?"

51:09.976 --> 51:13.673
They're still here,
the little bastards!

51:13.975 --> 51:16.808
Hands up! Let's go! Everybody up!

51:17.942 --> 51:19.739
Move it. Up against the wall.

51:20.502 --> 51:21.764
Let's go.

51:29.844 --> 51:32.574
Hands on top of your heads.
Nobody move.

51:33.045 --> 51:35.206
You are under arrest.

51:35.412 --> 51:37.642
You have the right to remain silent.

51:37.747 --> 51:41.239
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

51:41.300 --> 51:44.030
...in a court of law.
- He's dead, Murphy.

51:44.115 --> 51:47.175
- You have the right...
- You're reading Miranda to a corpse!

51:52.274 --> 51:54.799
I'm having trouble.

52:04.177 --> 52:05.644
Oh, my.

52:06.863 --> 52:09.263
This isn't very nice.

52:10.224 --> 52:13.318
Though you may think
you're having fun now...

52:13.391 --> 52:16.690
...you only hurt the one you love.

52:17.678 --> 52:19.771
Think of Mom and Dad.

52:19.886 --> 52:22.218
What kind of lesson are
you teaching them?

52:22.446 --> 52:25.540
And now, a word on nutrition.

52:25.613 --> 52:27.581
Shit! He's fucked up!

52:28.077 --> 52:31.240
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

52:31.341 --> 52:32.603
Let's go!

52:32.877 --> 52:34.276
The point is...

52:34.572 --> 52:36.767
...we all have to work.

52:37.452 --> 52:39.147
I haven't finished.

52:40.652 --> 52:42.483
Hit the gas, Murphy.

52:42.987 --> 52:45.854
The posted limit is 35.

52:45.931 --> 52:48.297
We should set an example, Anne.

52:50.986 --> 52:53.750
Your hair looks lovely that way.

52:53.962 --> 52:56.590
It's OCP. They did something to you.

52:56.906 --> 52:58.134
I'm fine.

53:02.345 --> 53:04.711
Isn't the moon wonderful tonight?

53:05.192 --> 53:06.750
It's still daytime.

53:07.336 --> 53:09.167
It's the thought that counts.

53:09.384 --> 53:13.286
Oh, Jesus, we're heading back
to the station. That's all there is to it.

53:28.230 --> 53:29.754
What the hell are you doing?!

53:29.893 --> 53:31.952
Waste makes haste...

53:32.070 --> 53:35.039
...for time is fleeting.

53:35.365 --> 53:38.994
A rolling stone is worth
two in the bush.

53:39.045 --> 53:41.240
Go fuck a refrigerator, pecker neck!

53:44.165 --> 53:46.725
Bad language makes for bad feelings.

53:47.044 --> 53:48.272
You're nuts!

53:52.643 --> 53:54.770
Murphy, come on, let's go.

53:56.258 --> 53:57.987
Come on!

54:04.449 --> 54:06.110
Back!

54:13.536 --> 54:16.130
Thank you for not smoking.

54:25.470 --> 54:27.961
Well, there it is. It's OCP.

54:28.542 --> 54:30.032
They screwed him up.

54:30.462 --> 54:32.623
He must be going out of his mind.

54:32.829 --> 54:35.161
It's not as if he can just say no.

54:35.261 --> 54:40.255
They put all this nonsense
into his brain. He has to obey.

54:40.252 --> 54:42.152
Take them out, all of them!

54:42.268 --> 54:44.759
Can't be done,
not with this equipment.

54:44.891 --> 54:47.985
Are you saying there's no way?
I can't believe that.

54:48.060 --> 54:51.188
Sure, there are ways.
You can pull his cranial circuits.

54:51.291 --> 54:53.555
Which would shut down
his life-support.

54:53.691 --> 54:56.888
You could run a few thousand volts
through him.

54:57.242 --> 54:58.971
Probably kill him.

55:49.052 --> 55:50.485
I'll get some help!

56:01.819 --> 56:03.650
- Get him inside!
- Come on, move it!

56:03.771 --> 56:05.864
- Come on!
- Don't touch him, he's hot!

56:05.979 --> 56:07.537
Use your jackets.

56:07.642 --> 56:08.870
Why'd he do that?

56:09.019 --> 56:11.783
Fried himself to get rid
of OCP's crazy commands.

56:11.962 --> 56:14.760
- Nice and easy.
- He weighs a ton.

56:21.530 --> 56:23.088
Out of the way! Move out!

56:28.025 --> 56:30.653
- Think he's alive?
- I don't know. He's pretty hot.

56:30.744 --> 56:32.006
Put me down.

56:36.759 --> 56:38.920
All right. Come on, stand him up.

56:52.341 --> 56:54.332
Are we cops?

56:54.453 --> 56:56.182
What's bugging you, Murph?

56:56.308 --> 56:57.900
Cain.

56:58.676 --> 57:00.143
Cain's bugging me.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.697
We have only just begun, my flock.

57:03.764 --> 57:06.494
Soon we will expand from city to city.

57:06.580 --> 57:09.014
The rich and poor alike
will know a paradise...

57:09.107 --> 57:12.076
...for every moment of their lives.

57:12.531 --> 57:15.295
This is a Nuke for every mood.

57:15.410 --> 57:16.968
We'll offer the opportunity...

57:17.105 --> 57:20.734
...to control every aspect
of their emotional lives.

57:20.786 --> 57:23.254
Here with the white noise
and black thunder...

57:23.345 --> 57:26.803
...and the red ramrod
and the blue velvet.

57:26.864 --> 57:29.594
Frank. The blue velvet.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.511
I think it's ready, sir.

57:36.335 --> 57:38.064
Thank you, Frank.

57:48.622 --> 57:53.753
Frank. The Benzedrine's
got my teeth wiggling.

57:53.741 --> 57:55.800
Cut it with scopolamine.

57:56.237 --> 57:58.501
- Five mils per.
- Yes, sir.

58:01.003 --> 58:02.903
Made in America.

58:03.021 --> 58:05.819
Yeah. We're gonna make that
mean something again.

58:10.700 --> 58:12.292
- Hey! Cops!
- What?

58:12.426 --> 58:13.723
Cops!

58:14.218 --> 58:17.551
And they ain't carrying
no picket signs!

58:17.930 --> 58:20.125
They're going to kick somebody's ass!

59:36.096 --> 59:38.564
Give me your hand, goddamn it!

01:00:54.646 --> 01:00:56.238
Christ!

01:00:57.941 --> 01:00:59.602
Fuck.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:02.577
Fuck!

01:01:03.189 --> 01:01:04.816
Get out!

01:01:05.173 --> 01:01:06.868
Bomb! Get down!

01:01:50.191 --> 01:01:52.352
You son of a bitch!

01:03:42.306 --> 01:03:45.867
Five hundred million in cash.
Nuke money seized by police.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:49.913
But State Attorney Sphincter won't let
the bankrupt city government touch it.

01:03:50.144 --> 01:03:54.103
Coming up next, threats from the police
union and cheers from the public...

01:03:54.143 --> 01:03:58.546
...as Metro-North cops go back to work
and apprehend the Nuke lord, Cain...

01:03:58.559 --> 01:04:00.857
...who may not live to stand trial.

01:04:04.542 --> 01:04:08.342
They say 20 seconds
in the California sunshine...

01:04:08.702 --> 01:04:11.296
...is too much these days...

01:04:11.516 --> 01:04:13.916
...ever since we lost the ozone layer.

01:04:14.013 --> 01:04:19.007
But that was before Sunblock 5000.

01:04:19.228 --> 01:04:22.220
Just apply a pint...

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.995
...to your body...

01:04:24.507 --> 01:04:27.305
...and you're good for hours.

01:04:28.827 --> 01:04:30.852
See you by the pool.

01:04:37.433 --> 01:04:39.993
<i>Sunblock 5000.</i>

01:04:40.154 --> 01:04:43.487
<i>Protection for the new age.</i>

01:04:44.056 --> 01:04:46.047
Subject is violently antisocial...

01:04:46.169 --> 01:04:49.661
...given to delusions of godhood.

01:04:49.911 --> 01:04:53.403
And he's hopelessly addicted
to narcotics.

01:04:54.392 --> 01:04:56.883
Which offers us a simple
and infallible method...

01:04:56.983 --> 01:05:00.282
...of insuring his obedience.

01:05:07.158 --> 01:05:08.523
You're perfect.

01:05:09.942 --> 01:05:11.432
I must have you.

01:05:15.317 --> 01:05:18.309
What are you talking about?
It's like you don't even care!

01:05:18.389 --> 01:05:21.324
- Just do what I say, Angie!
- He'd want us to come for him!

01:05:21.396 --> 01:05:24.957
Forget about it! It's not gonna happen!
I'm through arguing with you!

01:05:25.012 --> 01:05:29.346
I'm not asking permission! Cain is
in the hospital, and we're getting him.

01:05:29.364 --> 01:05:32.959
You've really thought this out, haven't you?
What about the cops?

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:34.443
We've got guns!

01:05:34.546 --> 01:05:37.276
- Damn it, Hob, Cain needs us!
- Fuck Cain!

01:05:39.058 --> 01:05:42.118
- He'd kill you if he heard you.
- He's not gonna kill anybody!

01:05:42.194 --> 01:05:45.288
- Shit, he's probably dead already.
- You just shut the hell up!

01:05:45.361 --> 01:05:49.127
You mouth off like that again,
and it's no more Nuke for you, bitch.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.645
Damn it, Hob, you know that's not fair.

01:05:53.905 --> 01:05:55.270
Now, come on.

01:05:55.537 --> 01:05:58.938
- It's been a bad time.
- Sure has. You're really hurting.

01:05:59.279 --> 01:06:00.712
Yeah, so I'm hurting.

01:06:00.847 --> 01:06:03.407
You're gonna get the shakes soon, Angie.

01:06:03.951 --> 01:06:05.248
You got it bad.

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:08.777
You little bastard.

01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:15.101
You just do what I tell you
from now on, Angie.

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:18.935
Start the motor and drive.

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:23.272
He'll kill you.

01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:25.125
He'll kill us both.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.687
Fuck him.

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:44.333
Oh, you're a mess.

01:06:46.889 --> 01:06:48.789
I got good news for you.

01:06:48.873 --> 01:06:52.138
You're going to have a chance
for immortality.

01:06:52.424 --> 01:06:56.087
As long as nothing happens
to that lovely brain.

01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:07.738
Dr. Weltman? It's Faxx.

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.715
I'm afraid we lost our patient.

01:07:10.247 --> 01:07:12.340
Yeah, he just expired.

01:07:12.582 --> 01:07:17.042
Contact the organ harvest team. We've got
six minutes before the brain's useless.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.852
Night.

01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:44.740
Come on. Let's move it.
We've only got five minutes.

01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:47.223
Lock it up.

01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:55.557
Move the screen in closer.
I can't read it.

01:07:57.216 --> 01:08:01.118
- How'd we get this one?
- Well, Faxx found him.

01:08:01.856 --> 01:08:03.790
He volunteered.

01:08:03.904 --> 01:08:05.633
Volunteered?

01:08:05.759 --> 01:08:07.420
Big-hearted guy.

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:10.076
Yeah, it's not the heart
we're after, though.

01:08:12.223 --> 01:08:15.590
Speaking of hearts, how's Ilene?

01:08:15.646 --> 01:08:17.841
Christ, does everybody know?

01:08:41.179 --> 01:08:43.238
All right, hold your breath.

01:08:45.883 --> 01:08:47.908
Showtime.

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:51.587
It's nice and clean in here.
There's no damage.

01:08:54.233 --> 01:08:56.029
Here we go.

01:08:56.121 --> 01:08:57.417
Easy.

01:08:59.032 --> 01:09:01.899
We got it. Here it comes.

01:09:02.072 --> 01:09:04.540
- Thing of beauty.
- Excellent.

01:09:04.633 --> 01:09:07.761
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm hungry.

01:10:22.158 --> 01:10:23.386
Thank you!

01:10:23.501 --> 01:10:24.763
Yes!

01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:26.468
Spider Baby Stalirski!

01:10:26.606 --> 01:10:30.098
He's come out for Detroit,
and now you come out for him.

01:10:30.157 --> 01:10:33.354
The lines are open,
waiting for your pledge.

01:10:33.421 --> 01:10:35.355
If you want an honest government...

01:10:35.468 --> 01:10:37.026
<i>...that works for you...</i>

01:10:38.124 --> 01:10:42.390
<i>...I'm asking you to dig deep
into your pockets.</i>

01:10:42.475 --> 01:10:45.342
<i>I'm asking you to give...</i>

01:10:45.963 --> 01:10:48.261
<i>...whatever you can spare!</i>

01:10:48.362 --> 01:10:49.989
Where does that put us?

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.574
Hi. Yes, ma'am.

01:10:56.714 --> 01:10:58.579
Hello! This is Mayor Kuzak!

01:10:58.761 --> 01:11:01.730
<i>Could you turn down your set, please?</i>

01:11:05.353 --> 01:11:07.048
Your Honor...

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:10.331
...I have some very good news for you.

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.410
I think...

01:11:12.551 --> 01:11:14.849
...the city is saved.

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.620
Now...

01:11:17.735 --> 01:11:20.499
...you listen very carefully.

01:11:21.255 --> 01:11:24.224
It's no bluff.
Someone's shown up to bail the city out.

01:11:24.294 --> 01:11:27.195
- A rival corporation.
- The mayor isn't saying.

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:30.899
And whoever it is is taking great
pains to keep their identity secret.

01:11:30.949 --> 01:11:34.749
They're paying in cash and they're not
moving the money through the banks.

01:11:34.789 --> 01:11:37.155
Thank you, councilman.

01:11:38.724 --> 01:11:40.385
That will be all.

01:11:40.837 --> 01:11:43.067
You know, once you guys take over...

01:11:43.171 --> 01:11:47.107
Your services to OCP
will be rewarded.

01:11:50.402 --> 01:11:53.894
If the city can pay,
we'll be humiliated.

01:11:53.955 --> 01:11:57.447
It's worse than that. We've shifted
80 percent of our resources...

01:11:57.506 --> 01:11:59.701
...to the urban pacification plan.

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:04.645
If we can't foreclose, public confidence
in OCP will plummet, so will our stock.

01:12:04.704 --> 01:12:05.966
Sir?

01:12:06.337 --> 01:12:07.634
If I may?

01:12:07.776 --> 01:12:09.607
There's another option.

01:12:10.464 --> 01:12:14.525
We certainly have the surveillance
capabilities to follow the mayor.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.883
It all depends how far
we're willing to go.

01:12:20.063 --> 01:12:21.655
If anything went wrong...

01:12:22.014 --> 01:12:23.709
As I said, sir...

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:26.105
...it all depends how far
we're willing to go.

01:12:26.207 --> 01:12:29.768
We have no legal recourse.

01:12:39.005 --> 01:12:41.030
There must be no witnesses.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.582
You've gone too far! Give me...

01:12:43.933 --> 01:12:45.230
Your blood pressure.

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:49.037
Get me fired if you want to.
You're not bringing illegal drugs to my lab!

01:12:49.084 --> 01:12:53.214
I'll do worse than get you fired.
Now leave me alone!

01:13:01.466 --> 01:13:03.991
Such terrible pain.

01:13:08.378 --> 01:13:10.539
You don't remember me.

01:13:11.576 --> 01:13:13.874
But you do remember this, don't you?

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:22.864
And we have it.
All the Nuke you'll ever need.

01:13:29.334 --> 01:13:31.199
Not so fast.

01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:34.248
I need you to do something
for me first.

01:13:35.094 --> 01:13:37.062
Then the pain stops.

01:13:39.573 --> 01:13:40.972
Good boy.

01:13:58.771 --> 01:14:02.400
I don't like this. I think we'd better
get out of here while we can.

01:14:02.449 --> 01:14:04.212
I know what I'm doing.

01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:36.178
If you have any cash,
put it in your shorts.

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:38.329
That's just plain rude.

01:14:50.636 --> 01:14:52.661
I wonder if any of you could help me.

01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:54.770
I'm looking for a Mr. Hob.

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:56.153
So...

01:14:56.587 --> 01:14:58.248
...how much you need?

01:14:59.211 --> 01:15:00.576
Money, I mean.

01:15:00.747 --> 01:15:03.841
Well, our current debt to OCP is...

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:08.785
$37,480,911 dollars.

01:15:09.066 --> 01:15:11.330
Guess you're in some pretty deep shit.

01:15:11.401 --> 01:15:13.528
We need all the help we can get,
young man.

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:16.271
Tell you what. Put me down for 50,
just to make sure.

01:15:16.841 --> 01:15:20.277
- 50 cents, 50 dollars. That's cute.
- Don't be a queer.

01:15:21.192 --> 01:15:22.489
Fifty million.

01:15:22.632 --> 01:15:25.123
This is bullshit.
Let's get out of here.

01:15:49.285 --> 01:15:51.150
Good God.

01:15:57.475 --> 01:15:58.965
Gentlemen?

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.995
Well, will 50 do it?

01:16:03.266 --> 01:16:06.326
Oh, yes. That'll do it.

01:16:06.402 --> 01:16:08.802
- Don't you guys think that'll do it?
- Yeah.

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:11.833
Fifty mil. That will do it.

01:16:11.970 --> 01:16:14.734
- That'll do it.
- These people are criminals!

01:16:14.817 --> 01:16:16.182
Why do you have to label people?

01:16:16.288 --> 01:16:18.518
- I hate labels!
- You shut up.

01:16:44.111 --> 01:16:47.012
We cannot capitulate
in the war on crime.

01:16:47.086 --> 01:16:50.487
I'd be voted out of office.
I don't think anyone wants that.

01:16:50.542 --> 01:16:52.510
War on crime is fine with us.

01:16:52.973 --> 01:16:55.305
It's business we're talking about here.

01:16:55.405 --> 01:16:57.737
Do you have any idea
how many people we employ?

01:16:57.837 --> 01:17:01.204
No. I never thought
about it like that.

01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:02.355
Sharp kid.

01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:03.897
So...

01:17:04.492 --> 01:17:06.016
...your war on crime...

01:17:06.156 --> 01:17:07.817
...you want to win it or what?

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:11.145
We're the only chance you have.

01:17:11.243 --> 01:17:13.006
Listen to him.

01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:14.859
He's got it all worked out.

01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:22.689
Why do people do crimes?

01:17:23.945 --> 01:17:27.711
- Why? Drugs. People do drugs.
- Because they want drugs.

01:17:27.753 --> 01:17:30.085
The kind that cost too much.

01:17:30.664 --> 01:17:33.497
Nuke gives high quality
at a cheap price.

01:17:33.577 --> 01:17:35.875
If you get off our backs,
we'll make it cheaper.

01:17:35.976 --> 01:17:36.965
And safer.

01:17:37.127 --> 01:17:39.493
We don't shove our shit
down anybody's throat.

01:17:39.592 --> 01:17:43.153
And we don't advertise it
like they do with cigarettes or booze.

01:17:43.207 --> 01:17:45.038
So leave us alone...

01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:47.957
...and anybody who wants it gets it.

01:17:50.342 --> 01:17:51.900
So no more crimes.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:55.728
You get to be the mayor
who cleaned up Detroit.

01:18:02.789 --> 01:18:04.586
He's got a point.

01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:07.330
Don't you think he's got a point?

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:09.428
Yeah, he's got a point.

01:18:14.659 --> 01:18:16.092
What the hell is that?

01:18:25.218 --> 01:18:26.913
Get out!

01:19:29.274 --> 01:19:31.208
Marv, are...?

01:21:06.926 --> 01:21:08.587
Cain.

01:21:09.101 --> 01:21:10.534
Oh, wow.

01:21:14.157 --> 01:21:15.954
You look great.

01:22:12.069 --> 01:22:14.936
It'll take some getting used to...

01:22:17.124 --> 01:22:19.649
...but it'll be great, Cain.

01:25:13.934 --> 01:25:15.162
Lie still.

01:25:20.397 --> 01:25:23.992
- I'm cold.
- You are going into shock.

01:25:24.301 --> 01:25:26.929
I will call for a medical emergency unit.

01:25:27.116 --> 01:25:29.380
Wait. No.

01:25:31.053 --> 01:25:32.816
Don't leave me.

01:25:35.435 --> 01:25:37.426
I won't leave you.

01:25:42.282 --> 01:25:44.045
Who did this?

01:25:44.171 --> 01:25:45.934
It was big.

01:25:46.473 --> 01:25:48.771
Bigger than you.

01:25:49.226 --> 01:25:50.921
It was Cain.

01:25:52.617 --> 01:25:54.585
I'm gonna die.

01:25:56.841 --> 01:25:59.332
You know what that's like, don't you?

01:26:00.359 --> 01:26:02.850
It really sucks.

01:26:08.807 --> 01:26:10.331
Yes.

01:26:30.276 --> 01:26:34.337
<i>Thirteen dead in what appears
to be a Nuke money massacre.</i>

01:26:34.372 --> 01:26:37.432
<i>Among the victims,
two city councilmen.</i>

01:26:37.507 --> 01:26:40.670
<i>Was the city trying to strike a deal
with the drug lords?</i>

01:26:40.739 --> 01:26:43.799
No comment!
I said, I have no comment!

01:26:43.874 --> 01:26:45.808
No comments on these allegations.

01:26:45.923 --> 01:26:48.915
These were men
who served this city tirelessly.

01:26:48.994 --> 01:26:53.192
However, I make a promise
to the people of Detroit City...

01:26:53.217 --> 01:26:56.414
...that no effort will be spared
to investigate this thoroughly!

01:26:56.481 --> 01:26:58.278
But, Mr. Mayor, what about...?

01:26:58.402 --> 01:27:00.893
I'm sorry. No more questions.

01:27:00.992 --> 01:27:03.017
<i>Our own Mayor Kuzak.</i>

01:27:03.136 --> 01:27:04.797
<i>Now let's go live to Jess.</i>

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:09.956
And here it is, the Civic Centrum, OCP's
100-story gift to the Motor City.

01:27:09.919 --> 01:27:12.945
While debate continues
over OCP's hostile takeover...

01:27:12.991 --> 01:27:15.585
...there's no denying
the mood down here is festive.

01:27:15.646 --> 01:27:19.138
Citizens interviewed on the scene
expressed excitement and hope...

01:27:19.198 --> 01:27:23.362
...that OCP will make good on its
promise of a better life in Detroit.

01:27:23.389 --> 01:27:25.414
- Press!
- Sorry, folks, media only.

01:27:25.501 --> 01:27:27.696
TV and press only.
You'll have to step back.

01:27:36.028 --> 01:27:37.256
There he is!

01:27:43.419 --> 01:27:45.546
Can OCP bring industry
back to Detroit?

01:27:45.659 --> 01:27:48.219
Does OCP own the city?
Will you hold elections?

01:27:48.314 --> 01:27:51.579
- Do we become OCP employees?
- Why not go to City Hall?

01:27:51.642 --> 01:27:53.132
Just a minute.

01:27:53.593 --> 01:27:55.458
I'll answer that, young lady.

01:27:55.578 --> 01:28:00.174
City Hall is the decaying symbol
of mismanagement and corruption.

01:28:00.152 --> 01:28:01.380
You get that?

01:28:01.497 --> 01:28:05.433
This magnificent structure will be the seat
of leadership for the new Detroit.

01:28:05.432 --> 01:28:08.697
And what better place
for a clean, fresh start?

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.786
And so, people of the press...

01:28:11.863 --> 01:28:13.558
...city officials...

01:28:13.686 --> 01:28:16.883
...in a few minutes
Omni Consumer Products...

01:28:16.951 --> 01:28:19.715
...and the troubled city of Detroit...

01:28:19.798 --> 01:28:23.598
...will join in a bold new venture.

01:28:23.637 --> 01:28:25.628
Now I'd like to explain...

01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:27.615
...just what this will mean.

01:28:27.733 --> 01:28:30.395
Sometimes we just
have to start over...

01:28:30.485 --> 01:28:31.816
...from scratch...

01:28:31.957 --> 01:28:33.788
...to make things right.

01:28:34.165 --> 01:28:37.532
And that's exactly
what we're going to do.

01:28:37.683 --> 01:28:40.151
We're going to build
a brand-new city...

01:28:40.244 --> 01:28:42.508
...where Detroit now stands.

01:28:42.612 --> 01:28:44.546
An example...

01:28:44.659 --> 01:28:46.286
...to the world.

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.548
My friends...

01:29:07.664 --> 01:29:10.895
...welcome to our city
as it should be.

01:29:10.992 --> 01:29:14.826
And as it will be,
in the hands of responsible...

01:29:14.863 --> 01:29:17.058
...private enterprise.

01:29:18.095 --> 01:29:20.086
And a special welcome...

01:29:20.207 --> 01:29:23.540
...to Mayor Kuzak
and the outgoing administration.

01:29:23.598 --> 01:29:25.498
We're not going anywhere.

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:27.391
Your Honor.

01:29:29.613 --> 01:29:32.707
You'll have to tear down a lot
of houses to make that.

01:29:32.781 --> 01:29:34.510
I mean, take away their homes!

01:29:34.636 --> 01:29:37.662
We're going to raise towers
of glass and steel.

01:29:37.741 --> 01:29:41.507
Every citizen will have a living unit,
safe, secure, and clean.

01:29:41.547 --> 01:29:43.014
Now, please take your seat.

01:29:43.148 --> 01:29:45.275
Won't be much room for neighborhoods.

01:29:45.387 --> 01:29:47.548
Not like the kind we all grew up in.

01:29:47.659 --> 01:29:50.651
Today neighborhoods are places
where bad things happen.

01:29:50.699 --> 01:29:51.927
Don't be nostalgic.

01:29:52.075 --> 01:29:55.135
What about democracy?
Nobody elected you.

01:29:55.211 --> 01:29:57.577
Anyone can buy OCP stock...

01:29:57.674 --> 01:30:00.234
...and own a piece of our city.

01:30:01.066 --> 01:30:03.296
What could be more democratic
than that?

01:30:03.402 --> 01:30:07.862
There's a lot of people in this town
that can't afford to buy your stock!

01:30:07.881 --> 01:30:10.042
And they won't let you
get away with this.

01:30:10.344 --> 01:30:12.312
You haven't been following the polls.

01:30:13.928 --> 01:30:15.486
Sit down.

01:30:16.615 --> 01:30:19.550
Sit down, mayor.

01:30:22.758 --> 01:30:25.352
About a year ago
we gave this city Robocop.

01:30:25.446 --> 01:30:27.744
I think he's worked out pretty well.

01:30:27.846 --> 01:30:30.144
But things have become
rougher out there.

01:30:30.245 --> 01:30:33.180
And now we need
a law enforcement unit...

01:30:33.254 --> 01:30:35.518
...able to meet the enemy
on his own ground...

01:30:35.621 --> 01:30:38.419
...and carrying enough firepower...

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.900
...to get the job done.

01:30:45.348 --> 01:30:47.407
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:30:47.523 --> 01:30:49.252
...with great pleasure...

01:30:49.507 --> 01:30:50.997
...I give you...

01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:53.301
...Robocop 2.

01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:04.825
- Those bastards are maniacs!
- What's the matter?

01:31:04.897 --> 01:31:07.798
I can't believe it.
It was them! They sent it!

01:31:07.872 --> 01:31:09.305
Sent what?

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.988
Nothing.

01:31:11.104 --> 01:31:13.504
There going to be a big call
for this unit.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.761
And we'll make him right here in Detroit.

01:31:15.871 --> 01:31:18.806
That means jobs
we can all be proud of.

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.007
And make "Made in America"...

01:31:21.119 --> 01:31:23.451
...mean something again.

01:31:26.239 --> 01:31:28.298
This single container...

01:31:28.414 --> 01:31:31.542
...holds enough Nuke
to addict a city block.

01:31:31.902 --> 01:31:34.666
A hundred of these
are produced every day...

01:31:34.717 --> 01:31:36.150
...and sent to sweatshops...

01:31:36.286 --> 01:31:39.221
...where urban slaves
prepare this poison...

01:31:39.292 --> 01:31:42.318
...for our friends, our loved ones,
our children.

01:31:42.397 --> 01:31:43.921
Now, I say...

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:47.325
...it's high time
we put an end to this plague.

01:31:47.387 --> 01:31:51.483
Robocop 2 will seek out
every laboratory...

01:31:51.516 --> 01:31:54.679
...every dealer,
and rid our city of Nuke.

01:31:58.650 --> 01:31:59.947
Yes.

01:32:00.090 --> 01:32:03.253
Things will be a lot quieter
with this boy around.

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.497
- What's wrong with him?
- It's nothing.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.091
- Nothing at all.
- Turn him off.

01:32:24.055 --> 01:32:25.283
I can't.

01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:27.694
Cain! Let's step outside.

01:32:30.263 --> 01:32:33.255
You! Get out of here!
You're obsolete!

01:32:33.335 --> 01:32:34.893
That thing is a killer!

01:32:34.998 --> 01:32:38.456
- It's not even armed! It's harmless!
- It's a killer, and I saw it!

01:32:53.811 --> 01:32:56.245
- Take her out of here! Now!
- Let me go!

01:33:16.401 --> 01:33:18.892
Behave yourselves!

01:34:04.394 --> 01:34:08.455
- What's the deal here?
- Christ knows. Sounds like a war in there.

01:35:18.977 --> 01:35:21.844
You're coming with me, Cain.

01:37:15.666 --> 01:37:17.156
There he is!

01:37:28.305 --> 01:37:31.832
- All right, get back!
- Are you jealous of the replacement?

01:38:20.170 --> 01:38:23.003
This could look bad for OCP, Johnson.

01:38:23.465 --> 01:38:26.263
Scramble the best spin team we have.

01:39:32.961 --> 01:39:35.429
Ammo! Ammo!

01:39:54.654 --> 01:39:56.144
Get down!

01:40:16.955 --> 01:40:18.183
Hold your fire!

01:40:18.715 --> 01:40:21.275
Hold your fire, damn it!

01:40:42.487 --> 01:40:43.920
Let's get him out of here.

01:40:46.071 --> 01:40:49.404
Watch his neck. He's hurt bad. Easy.

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:56.611
Shit!

01:40:58.230 --> 01:40:59.219
I gotta get back.

01:40:59.382 --> 01:41:01.407
Move it back! Move it back!

01:41:15.924 --> 01:41:18.324
Let's give him what he wants.

01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.303
Goodbye.

01:43:46.113 --> 01:43:48.445
It's serious trouble.
So many dead and wounded.

01:43:48.545 --> 01:43:50.536
There won't be trouble from the dead.

01:43:50.656 --> 01:43:52.817
They'll have relatives. They always do.

01:43:52.928 --> 01:43:55.897
- It'll be a feeding frenzy.
- It's only money.

01:43:55.967 --> 01:43:57.992
- What about criminal proceedings?
- Well...

01:43:58.111 --> 01:44:01.945
...we're looking at major indictments, sir.
Prison terms.

01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:04.578
- What about me?
- You know we'll do whatever we can.

01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:06.501
- That's not good enough.
- Sir?

01:44:06.622 --> 01:44:08.886
What if this was the work
of one individual?

01:44:08.957 --> 01:44:12.893
A person who had her own agenda, wasn't
in sync with the goals of our company?

01:44:12.925 --> 01:44:15.655
Well, that usually works.

01:44:16.029 --> 01:44:18.463
A woman who was not a team player.

01:44:18.556 --> 01:44:21.150
Who violated our trust.

01:44:22.203 --> 01:44:24.433
Easy, easy.

01:44:24.827 --> 01:44:26.317
Well...

01:44:26.459 --> 01:44:28.893
...we'd need some evidence
to support that.

01:44:28.955 --> 01:44:31.719
Sir, whether it exists or not,
I know I can find it.

01:44:31.802 --> 01:44:34.794
She did choose the brain, sir.

01:44:36.123 --> 01:44:38.353
- Good thinking.
- Sir.

01:44:38.458 --> 01:44:40.585
Thank God you're all right.

01:44:40.697 --> 01:44:43.996
I was worried. I thought
it was going to hurt you.

01:44:44.058 --> 01:44:46.117
It's over. It's all over.

01:44:47.352 --> 01:44:48.842
I failed you.

01:44:48.985 --> 01:44:52.819
Don't be hard on yourself.
Everything's going to be all right.

01:44:55.224 --> 01:44:59.320
Johnson, that business
we were talking about.

01:44:59.319 --> 01:45:01.219
Get right on it.

01:45:05.174 --> 01:45:06.641
Yes, sir.

01:45:10.965 --> 01:45:14.025
Just look at what they've done.
They are criminals.

01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:16.834
OCP won't own this city for long.
And I'll see to that.

01:45:16.917 --> 01:45:19.283
I'll take it to the streets
and the people.

01:45:19.381 --> 01:45:20.746
What has it come to?

01:45:20.885 --> 01:45:23.547
Businessmen can buy our rights
like stock?

01:45:23.636 --> 01:45:25.695
You don't realize what we're losing!

01:45:27.412 --> 01:45:29.607
- Right here, sir!
- Give us a statement!

01:45:29.715 --> 01:45:33.412
Dozens are dead.
Is this your idea of a better life?

01:45:33.459 --> 01:45:37.293
- Was this an experiment of some kind?
- He was crazy. How did it happen?

01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:41.232
- Did you build it to take control?
- How do you account for this disaster?

01:45:41.266 --> 01:45:44.429
Will OCP make reparations
to the victims?

01:45:45.042 --> 01:45:47.476
That son of a bitch
is getting away with it.

01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:49.435
We can't even touch him.

01:45:50.801 --> 01:45:52.564
Patience, Lewis.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.900
We're only human.
