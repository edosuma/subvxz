00:02.081 --> 00:04.149
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.216 --> 00:06.317
Chef Ramsay heads to music city...

00:06.418 --> 00:07.719
Nashville, Tennessee,

00:07.820 --> 00:10.755
but he is immediately forced
to deal with a sour note.

00:10.856 --> 00:12.690
What the hell are you doing?

00:12.758 --> 00:15.860
This cajun restaurant is
run by chef/owner Chappy...

00:15.961 --> 00:17.895
The guy in the big hat.

00:17.996 --> 00:19.196
Whose careless methods

00:19.297 --> 00:20.998
- have hurt his eatery...
- They hate it all.

00:21.099 --> 00:22.299
As well as his wife's confidence.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.301
Show that you care,

00:24.402 --> 00:27.470
or we have done all of this for nothing.

00:27.538 --> 00:29.272
He blames Nashville customers...

00:29.339 --> 00:32.441
- Both came back.
- That's the Nashville folks we know and love.

00:32.543 --> 00:34.577
When he should really
be taking a hard look...

00:34.679 --> 00:36.179
Oh, my God.

00:36.213 --> 00:37.580
At his less-than-appetizing food...

00:37.682 --> 00:41.017
It looks like Chappy
took a crappy in my gumbo.

00:41.118 --> 00:43.218
And his disturbing kitchen practices.

00:43.319 --> 00:45.220
See the mold on these things?

00:45.321 --> 00:47.222
And in spite of Chef Ramsay
showing him the way...

00:47.323 --> 00:48.957
You have to open your eyes.

00:49.059 --> 00:51.660
Chappy prefers his own destructive route.

00:51.761 --> 00:53.162
You don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.963
This place should be shut down.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.799
Find out if Chef Ramsay can get through

00:56.900 --> 00:58.300
to the stubborn owner...

00:58.401 --> 01:00.634
Listen to me, something
you're not very good at doing.

01:00.703 --> 01:02.603
There's nothing wrong with my food.

01:02.705 --> 01:04.638
Or will Chappy's come crashing down?

01:09.692 --> 01:10.978
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:10.979 --> 01:13.681
What is that? You're serving rotten food.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.083
- You could possibly kill them.
- Then wake up!

01:16.184 --> 01:17.383
You wake up!

01:17.484 --> 01:19.619
- Shut the place down.
- Get out of here!

01:19.653 --> 01:21.421
That is amazing.

01:21.522 --> 01:23.223
I can't take any more.

01:23.324 --> 01:25.759
Thank you, Chef.

01:30.164 --> 01:33.999
Nashville, Tennessee, the
epicenter of country music,

01:34.101 --> 01:35.400
and home to Chappy's restaurant,

01:35.435 --> 01:39.105
a cajun eatery owned
by John "Chappy" Chapman

01:39.206 --> 01:40.940
and his wife Starr.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.174
It's ready.

01:42.242 --> 01:43.743
I started when I was about 2 1/2

01:43.844 --> 01:45.745
with my mother in the kitchen.

01:45.846 --> 01:48.579
I was the one that would
put the crabs in the pot.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.281
Aah!

01:50.382 --> 01:51.883
Thank you for coming.

01:51.984 --> 01:53.985
We opened our first
Chappy's in a little town

01:54.086 --> 01:57.421
called Long Beach, Mississippi,
in 1984. Bon appétit.

01:57.522 --> 02:01.926
And it was a huge, overnight success.

02:02.027 --> 02:03.761
But in 2005,

02:03.862 --> 02:06.964
after hurricane Katrina
destroyed the restaurant,

02:07.065 --> 02:10.901
Chappy and Starr were forced
to relocate to Nashville.

02:11.002 --> 02:12.903
Chappy, my table doesn't
like the crab cakes

02:13.004 --> 02:14.204
or the turtle soup.

02:14.305 --> 02:16.606
That's the Nashville
folks we know and love.

02:16.707 --> 02:18.642
I think people in Nashville have a problem

02:18.743 --> 02:19.976
with New Orleans cuisine.

02:20.043 --> 02:22.044
They hate it all.

02:22.146 --> 02:23.746
Oh, well. These people don't know.

02:25.883 --> 02:27.984
Fine.

02:28.085 --> 02:30.086
I definitely don't think our issue is

02:30.187 --> 02:31.788
the people of Nashville.

02:31.889 --> 02:32.922
I have to send it back.

02:33.023 --> 02:35.323
It's overcooked and it tastes fishy.

02:35.424 --> 02:39.027
- The issue is more Chappy.
- Don't argue. Move on!

02:39.128 --> 02:40.762
Chappy is extremely hard-headed.

02:40.963 --> 02:42.563
- There's nothing wrong with my food.
- Chap...

02:42.665 --> 02:44.365
Both came back.

02:44.466 --> 02:47.102
If Chappy would listen to feedback,

02:47.203 --> 02:49.204
the business would be doing much better.

02:51.807 --> 02:54.842
It's a barramundi. That's
what I need working.

02:54.943 --> 02:55.943
The menu, it's like a book.

02:56.044 --> 02:57.044
I do want to let you know

02:57.145 --> 02:58.145
about some appetizers

02:58.246 --> 02:59.246
that we're featuring tonight

02:59.347 --> 03:00.647
that are not listed.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.984
Not to mention the 15, 16
things we have to recite.

03:04.085 --> 03:05.786
We have crab cakes paneer.

03:05.887 --> 03:06.886
Swordfish piccata.

03:06.987 --> 03:07.887
We also have our blackened shrimp.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.222
Two lobster tails.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.423
They're stacked on top
of one another twice.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.925
I think that's it.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.527
- That's a lot to remember.
- I said etouffée, right?

03:14.628 --> 03:17.063
I can't see how he makes any money.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.965
We do not have the volume

03:19.066 --> 03:22.368
to be able to sell all that stuff.

03:22.469 --> 03:23.768
Chappy's definitely needs an update.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.138
It's not 1984 anymore.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.506
They called, they want
their wallpaper back.

03:30.609 --> 03:33.045
Chappy, on 120, the lady did
not like the salad dressing.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.246
What was the matter with it?

03:34.347 --> 03:36.348
She said the blue cheese
dressing is too thin.

03:36.449 --> 03:37.950
- Just get her out of here.
- Yes, Chappy.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.484
Everybody thinks they know better.

03:40.585 --> 03:42.086
So it's my job to make sure

03:42.187 --> 03:43.888
it stays the way it's supposed to be.

03:43.989 --> 03:45.589
What are y'all doing? I need to know.

03:45.724 --> 03:47.424
We're taking the prime rib off of his check

03:47.525 --> 03:49.026
'cause he didn't like
it, and he returned it.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.461
He didn't like the other one either.

03:50.528 --> 03:52.129
- He sent 'em both back, the fish too.
- John, John...

03:52.231 --> 03:53.564
For Chappy's to be saved,

03:53.665 --> 03:55.298
I think we need Chappy to change.

03:55.366 --> 03:57.267
Why waste my time?

03:57.368 --> 04:00.570
And it's not about your
pride or your experience.

04:00.671 --> 04:03.006
It's about doing what you need to do

04:03.107 --> 04:05.708
to help your business evolve
and go to the next level.

04:05.809 --> 04:07.610
I don't know what's happened.

04:07.711 --> 04:10.046
Ultimately, the success of
Chappy's relies on Chappy.

04:21.491 --> 04:22.892
Wow. What is that?

04:25.528 --> 04:27.428
- Ghastly. Hello.
- Hi. Welcome.

04:27.462 --> 04:29.463
Wow, what an entrance that was.

04:29.531 --> 04:32.967
That mannequin's [Bleep]
scary, you know. Jeez!

04:33.068 --> 04:35.069
God, it spooked me.

04:35.170 --> 04:36.570
- Your first name is?
- I'm Nicole.

04:36.605 --> 04:37.471
Nice to see you. Wow.

04:37.572 --> 04:38.806
This place is like a museum in here.

04:38.908 --> 04:40.909
- Mm-hmm. Yes.
- Huh?

04:41.010 --> 04:42.910
It's got a lot of New Orleans
paraphernalia everywhere.

04:43.011 --> 04:45.512
Chappy and Starr, actually, his wife,

04:45.613 --> 04:46.846
had a restaurant on the Gulf coast.

04:46.948 --> 04:50.250
Wow, wow, wow. Is that him
there with the big chef's hat?

04:50.351 --> 04:51.952
- That is. Yeah.
- Wow. Where is the man?

04:52.053 --> 04:53.153
Uh, he is actually in the kitchen.

04:53.254 --> 04:54.788
I'd like to have a quick word with him.

04:54.889 --> 04:56.390
- Sure, let me go check.
- Thank you.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.091
I'll be right back.

04:59.793 --> 05:01.427
Oh. Wow, what's that?

05:01.528 --> 05:04.230
Looks like a costume that
Elton John would wear.

05:04.331 --> 05:08.567
Is that Chappy? Wow.

05:08.668 --> 05:11.670
Hey, Chappy, Chef Ramsay just got here.

05:11.771 --> 05:12.972
And before he sits, he wants to know

05:13.073 --> 05:14.573
if you have a second to chat with him.

05:14.674 --> 05:16.107
It'll be just a few minutes.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.508
Okay.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.812
- He is gonna be right out.
- Yeah. Excellent.

05:26.752 --> 05:30.855
Yeah, he's gonna be right out, he told me.

05:30.989 --> 05:32.789
Is he alone in the kitchen?
Does he have any assistants?

05:32.890 --> 05:35.092
No, he's got some back there. He's, uh...

05:35.193 --> 05:37.194
I think there's three
men back there with him.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.330
Let me go check and see
how he's doing, okay?

05:39.431 --> 05:40.530
- Yeah. Excellent.
- Mm-hmm.

05:40.631 --> 05:41.832
Thank you.

05:43.935 --> 05:45.836
- Are we getting close, Chappy?
- Yeah?

05:45.937 --> 05:47.670
Okay. He is right up in the front.

05:59.316 --> 06:02.151
Oh... dear.

06:02.252 --> 06:04.353
I'm gonna get a glass of water,

06:04.454 --> 06:05.553
then I'll go meet Darth Vader.

06:05.654 --> 06:07.356
Uh-huh.

06:09.592 --> 06:11.693
Wow. How are you?

06:11.794 --> 06:13.228
Gordon, nice to meet you.

06:13.296 --> 06:14.696
- Those pants are bright.
- I'm a hot pepper, brother.

06:14.797 --> 06:16.931
Wow, wow, wow. Throwback to the '80s?

06:17.033 --> 06:18.233
It's just something I've always worn.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.333
Wow, look at that thing there.

06:19.434 --> 06:21.835
That's when I was cute and young.

06:21.936 --> 06:23.537
- Cute and young? How long ago was that?
- You remember those days?

06:23.638 --> 06:25.572
I do. Just take me back to the beginning.

06:25.673 --> 06:28.809
- How long have you been here?
- Since June of '06.

06:28.977 --> 06:30.777
- Right. Mm-hmm.
- After Katrina.

06:30.879 --> 06:32.813
What's the comparison
between here and Mississippi?

06:32.914 --> 06:35.015
Mississippi was kind of never-ending,

06:35.116 --> 06:36.316
because it was 23 years.

06:36.417 --> 06:39.952
So it was a long time
in a successful business,

06:40.054 --> 06:41.154
- doing what I do.
- You're amazing.

06:41.255 --> 06:43.056
And here... talk me
through the first two years,

06:43.157 --> 06:47.494
- business-wise.
- Kind of a rough beginning here in Nashville.

06:47.594 --> 06:48.794
Of course, the new guys in town...

06:48.896 --> 06:50.096
- People are afraid of us.
- Mm-hmm.

06:50.197 --> 06:53.298
You know, we don't do
traditional Nashville food...

06:53.433 --> 06:55.534
burgers and pulled pork and chicken wings.

06:55.635 --> 06:56.735
We don't do that.

06:56.836 --> 06:58.337
No, we do the New Orleans food.

06:58.438 --> 07:00.639
So a lot of people were afraid.

07:00.740 --> 07:02.874
And this is what we're trying
to deal with still to this day.

07:03.015 --> 07:04.316
And here, you're taking a play

07:04.417 --> 07:07.218
- on fine dining?
- It's more like I'm taking a play

07:07.319 --> 07:10.054
on casual fine dining.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.655
- Look at those napkins.
- Yeah.

07:11.756 --> 07:12.856
Um, waiters' bow ties. I mean,

07:12.891 --> 07:14.492
it doesn't strike me as somewhat casual.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.060
I mean, it's quite formal, no?

07:16.161 --> 07:19.297
- Uh... no.
- Right. Okay.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.799
My God, I've been doing this a long time.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.634
I've eaten all over the
world. I see what people do.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.136
I don't think I'm so far off.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.771
And how would you rate your
food, currently, out of ten?

07:28.839 --> 07:30.440
- What would you give it?
- I wouldn't put it out

07:30.541 --> 07:32.976
- if I didn't think it was delicious.
- Just asking.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.277
So I give 'em a ten every
time I do it, you know.

07:34.378 --> 07:35.479
Okay. Well, let me sit down,

07:35.513 --> 07:36.980
have a little run at the menu,

07:37.081 --> 07:39.415
- and get up to speed with your style of cooking.
- Okay.

07:39.516 --> 07:41.817
- Thank you. Yes.
- I think they have a table over there for you.

07:41.918 --> 07:44.253
I think my food is the
best New Orleans cuisine

07:44.321 --> 07:45.721
in Nashville, hands down.

07:45.822 --> 07:49.558
So I can't figure out why
people haven't come enjoyed.

07:49.659 --> 07:51.360
All right.

07:51.461 --> 07:53.895
I was gonna put my Chappy hat on.

07:53.997 --> 07:55.497
We actually get a lot
of people that do that.

07:55.598 --> 07:57.599
- Do you?
- Uh-huh.

07:57.699 --> 07:58.833
- Little chappies.
- Right.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.636
Okay, so this is our
lunch selection right here.

08:01.737 --> 08:03.538
- Thank you. Wow, this is a big lunch menu.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:03.639 --> 08:04.739
Dinner menu's even larger.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.342
- Wow, wow, wow. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.377
Wow.

08:09.478 --> 08:10.778
Hello. How are you?

08:10.879 --> 08:12.479
- Fantastic. And yourself?
- I'm so happy to be here.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.980
Welcome to Chappy's. My name is T.J.

08:14.081 --> 08:15.182
- Nice to meet you. T.J.
- Good to see you.

08:15.283 --> 08:18.318
- We have, like, ten different specials.
- What?

08:18.419 --> 08:20.120
As well as five different appetizers.

08:20.221 --> 08:23.323
- 15 specials?
- Yes.

08:23.424 --> 08:25.159
On top of this?

08:25.260 --> 08:26.660
Yeah. And they change every day?

08:26.761 --> 08:27.960
That's a lot to take in.

08:28.061 --> 08:29.995
No, actually, it stays exactly the same.

08:30.063 --> 08:32.097
Ah. They've been the
same since I've been here.

08:32.198 --> 08:36.001
Wow. So you know this $8.95 crawfish?

08:36.102 --> 08:38.203
I saw it's on there twice.
It's the same on the lunch menu

08:38.304 --> 08:39.238
as it is on the dinner menu.

08:39.339 --> 08:40.539
- Yeah.
- Only the price changes.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.575
So for the lunch menu, the
crawfish etouffée is $8.95.

08:43.643 --> 08:44.842
How much is it for dinner on the special?

08:44.943 --> 08:45.877
Uh, $29.95.

08:45.978 --> 08:48.280
So it jumps $20. And what changes?

08:48.381 --> 08:51.583
Nothing.

08:51.684 --> 08:53.918
T.J., come on.

08:54.019 --> 08:57.322
Your price jumps 3 1/2 times
for the special on the dinner,

08:57.423 --> 08:58.823
and nothing changes?

08:58.924 --> 09:00.558
You don't even throw me an
extra couple of tails in there?

09:00.659 --> 09:02.459
Shame on you, T.J.

09:02.494 --> 09:04.461
Well, not me. I...

09:04.563 --> 09:05.762
Is that just for the... crawfish,

09:05.863 --> 09:07.064
or is that for all the specials?

09:07.199 --> 09:08.799
It pretty much... it's pretty standard.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.402
Wow.

09:11.503 --> 09:13.504
So let's start off with, please,

09:13.605 --> 09:15.005
- the fried green tomatoes, please.
- Okay.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.740
- The chicken and sausage gumbo as well, please.
- Okay.

09:17.841 --> 09:20.343
And I'll go for that
steak and lobster rocket.

09:20.444 --> 09:21.444
Very good.

09:21.545 --> 09:24.080
Thank you. Wow.

09:24.181 --> 09:26.583
- Fried green tomatoes.
- Thank you.

09:26.684 --> 09:28.484
- What?
- Fried green.

09:28.586 --> 09:33.121
The rest of his order is going in now.

09:33.223 --> 09:34.856
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

09:34.924 --> 09:36.425
- How are you?
- I'm fine, I think. How are you?

09:36.526 --> 09:37.759
Nice to meet you. Starr Chapman.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.461
Starr, nice to see you.
Please, take a seat.

09:39.562 --> 09:41.362
- Well, welcome.
- Thank you. I'm happy to be here.

09:41.463 --> 09:43.163
- My first time in Nashville.
- Really? How do you like it?

09:43.265 --> 09:44.699
Yeah, wonderful, thank you.

09:44.799 --> 09:46.800
- We're happy to have you.
- Are you involved with the business daily?

09:46.901 --> 09:49.203
- Always. Yes, hands on.
- Oh, really?

09:49.304 --> 09:52.340
- I work the front of the house, I work the office.
- Wow.

09:52.441 --> 09:54.542
- I wear many hats. Have to.
- Uh-huh.

09:54.643 --> 09:56.544
And your husband, of course, Chappy.

09:56.645 --> 09:57.944
How long have you been together?

09:58.045 --> 09:59.279
- 29 years.
- 29 years.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.981
- Yes, sir.
- Does he listen to your input?

10:02.015 --> 10:04.684
- Not always.
- Not always. Why?

10:04.785 --> 10:05.885
Because he's a hard-headed man.

10:05.986 --> 10:09.122
I think he's set in his ways.

10:09.156 --> 10:11.023
But when it's not working, you'd adapt.

10:11.125 --> 10:13.626
Exactly. Looking at our menu,

10:13.727 --> 10:15.461
I think it's too big.

10:15.562 --> 10:16.962
I think it needs to be downsized.

10:17.063 --> 10:19.064
It's too much.

10:19.165 --> 10:20.766
You've gotta be able to adapt and change.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.701
It seems like you've hit a wall.

10:22.802 --> 10:25.103
Absolutely. That's why you're here.

10:25.204 --> 10:27.906
- Mm-hmm.
- I think that's gonna be the key.

10:28.007 --> 10:30.441
I believe Chef Ramsay is the only person

10:30.542 --> 10:31.743
who could turn Chappy around.

10:31.843 --> 10:36.581
For me, it's like trying to blow
air into a balloon with a hole in it.

10:36.682 --> 10:38.683
All right, the fried
green tomato appetizer.

10:38.784 --> 10:40.985
Mm-hmm. Is that parmesan on there?

10:41.086 --> 10:43.488
It is. And crawfish tails
and hollandaise sauce.

10:43.622 --> 10:44.522
- Thanks, T.J.
- You're welcome.

10:44.623 --> 10:45.722
I'm dying to taste these

10:45.823 --> 10:46.823
- fried green tomatoes.
- Okay, good.

10:46.924 --> 10:49.025
- Well, enjoy. Bon appétit.
- Thank you.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.527
Oh, how would you rate
the food, by the way?

10:50.662 --> 10:51.961
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

10:52.062 --> 10:53.764
I just think it needs to be modernized,

10:53.864 --> 10:57.867
revamped, and "shhhp" the menu.

11:01.205 --> 11:03.205
She says it's excellent,

11:03.307 --> 11:05.408
and yet it needs to be
modernized and revamped.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.242
That doesn't sound like excellent.

11:07.344 --> 11:08.644
Because surely, if it was excellent,

11:08.745 --> 11:10.045
you wouldn't have to
do any of those things.

11:13.983 --> 11:16.619
It's bland.

11:16.687 --> 11:19.086
All right, what'd we think
of the fried green tomatoes?

11:19.188 --> 11:20.722
Uh, yeah, bland.

11:20.823 --> 11:22.424
That hollandaise sauce is almost just like

11:22.525 --> 11:24.125
a sort of... a melted butter.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.728
- Yeah, it doesn't even taste of anything.
- Sorry about that.

11:26.829 --> 11:28.763
Not your fault.

11:28.864 --> 11:30.865
Right. Next up would be the
chicken and sausage gumbo.

11:30.966 --> 11:33.967
- Gumbo? Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.607
He said your hollandaise
sauce was extremely bland.

11:40.742 --> 11:44.244
It just tastes like a strong butter sauce.

11:44.346 --> 11:46.347
It's very good.

11:46.448 --> 11:48.349
When we bring a dish back to the kitchen,

11:48.450 --> 11:50.082
he acts like it's an insult,

11:50.183 --> 11:51.484
not that there's possibly something wrong

11:51.585 --> 11:53.786
with the actual dish.

11:55.288 --> 11:57.022
Gumbo. Wow.

11:57.123 --> 12:01.828
It looks like Chappy
took a crappy in my gumbo.

12:01.928 --> 12:04.764
It's like a puddle. It's just watery.

12:04.865 --> 12:06.565
Really watery.

12:10.069 --> 12:12.303
That is [Bleep] disgusting.

12:12.405 --> 12:14.906
If this dish was done right,
it could be a game changer.

12:15.007 --> 12:16.808
But right now, it's a game ender.

12:16.909 --> 12:20.144
T.J., is there a problem in the kitchen?

12:20.246 --> 12:22.446
- It's not even hot.
- It's not hot?

12:22.547 --> 12:25.983
No. I mean, it's just,
like, lukewarm and gloopy.

12:26.084 --> 12:27.084
- See the skin?
- Yeah.

12:27.185 --> 12:29.487
Very watery. There's no flavor anywhere.

12:29.588 --> 12:31.689
- Just bland.
- Gotcha.

12:31.790 --> 12:33.624
- I'll bring the next one.
- Thank you.

12:33.725 --> 12:35.626
- Okay.
- Wow.

12:37.328 --> 12:39.529
Chappy, first of all, this is cold.

12:39.630 --> 12:41.163
Just absolutely filled with water.

12:41.265 --> 12:43.566
Filled with water?

12:43.667 --> 12:45.167
I thought I drained it pretty well.

12:48.706 --> 12:50.707
- Hi.
- Hey. He hates everything.

12:50.808 --> 12:51.908
Uh-oh.

12:52.009 --> 12:56.144
He hasn't liked anything I've done so far.

12:56.245 --> 13:00.048
All right, garnish it up.

13:00.149 --> 13:02.250
Steak and lobster rocket.

13:02.385 --> 13:06.988
- Steak and lobster rocket.
- Thank you.

13:07.089 --> 13:08.189
That's a very funny-looking lobster.

13:08.291 --> 13:11.526
Seriously. How much is this dish?

13:11.560 --> 13:13.828
$36.95.

13:13.929 --> 13:15.329
Jeez, come on. Stop.

13:15.431 --> 13:18.966
And why is the filet butterflied like that?

13:19.067 --> 13:21.168
I mean, cut like that?

13:21.269 --> 13:24.872
He cuts it off and then pounds it thin.

13:24.973 --> 13:28.007
He beats the crap out of a filet...

13:28.108 --> 13:30.811
to tenderize it, when
it's the most stunning cut?

13:30.912 --> 13:33.246
Wow.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.787
Wow.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.387
Try it?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.089
- I'll try it. No.
- Please.

13:44.190 --> 13:47.292
Come on.

13:47.393 --> 13:48.928
That is chewy.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.330
The lobster I couldn't even eat.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.932
As I was trying to bite down on it,

13:53.032 --> 13:54.032
it was bouncing back.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.969
Steak and lobster rocket.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.404
Someone needs a [Bleep] rocket
up his [Bleep] to wake up.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.474
- Oh, my God.
- I'll be right back.

14:02.608 --> 14:04.308
Don't swallow that one.

14:04.409 --> 14:06.410
You need a napkin?

14:06.512 --> 14:09.013
Maybe Chappy needs to
get on a [Bleep] rocket.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.449
A rocket back to New Orleans
to see how it's properly done.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.150
Fast.

14:14.251 --> 14:17.354
He said the dish is just a mess.

14:17.455 --> 14:18.388
I don't want to throw it down his throat

14:18.490 --> 14:19.490
if he doesn't want it.

14:19.591 --> 14:20.791
He couldn't even get through the steak.

14:20.892 --> 14:21.825
It was all gristle.

14:21.893 --> 14:23.093
- It was gristle?
- Yeah.

14:23.194 --> 14:25.996
- What do you mean "gristle"?
- Gristle and chewy.

14:26.130 --> 14:30.833
Okay, well... it's like butter.

14:30.934 --> 14:32.434
Is it not?

14:32.536 --> 14:34.470
Chef Ramsay's a dumb-ass.

14:34.571 --> 14:36.672
If there's something that
I think is absolutely wrong,

14:36.707 --> 14:37.773
he doesn't know what he's talking about,

14:37.875 --> 14:38.875
I'm gonna tell him... "You don't know

14:38.976 --> 14:40.710
what the hell you're talking about."

14:46.982 --> 14:50.084
After enduring Chappy's
flavorless cajun cuisine...

14:50.186 --> 14:51.385
Can you take me through
the kitchen, please?

14:51.486 --> 14:52.986
I sure can.

14:53.087 --> 14:54.522
Chef Ramsay heads to the kitchen,

14:54.623 --> 14:56.123
looking for an explanation.

14:56.224 --> 14:57.625
I don't know where to start.

14:57.726 --> 14:59.026
I was so excited coming here,

14:59.127 --> 15:02.363
but I'm disappointed.

15:02.464 --> 15:04.565
- Did you cook everything?
- Uh-huh.

15:04.666 --> 15:06.767
The fried green tomatoes,
what are you cooking them in?

15:06.868 --> 15:08.468
- Corn flour.
- Corn flour.

15:08.569 --> 15:11.103
A little seasoning. For
me, there was no seasoning.

15:11.205 --> 15:12.405
It was bland.

15:12.506 --> 15:16.108
And the hollandaise sauce
was just melted butter.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.545
Yeah.

15:19.847 --> 15:21.848
Steak and lobster rocket.

15:21.949 --> 15:25.484
The lobster was like rubber.

15:25.585 --> 15:27.686
And when you have a $36 entrée,

15:27.787 --> 15:29.988
you don't expect to see filet pounded.

15:32.425 --> 15:34.059
That's the last thing you ever do.

15:34.227 --> 15:36.328
I've never met a chef anywhere in the world

15:36.429 --> 15:38.230
that pounds out a filet.

15:38.331 --> 15:41.499
Why would you pound
something that is tender?

15:41.567 --> 15:43.368
Just a technique of what we do.

15:43.469 --> 15:46.604
Just shaping it so it fits, it stacks.

15:46.705 --> 15:51.809
It's not clay, it's meat.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.144
The chicken and sausage gumbo... bland.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.346
But do you know what?

15:56.447 --> 15:57.547
Forget the seasoning.

15:57.648 --> 15:58.749
It wasn't even hot. It was lukewarm.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.350
I sent it out as soon as I did it.

16:00.451 --> 16:02.519
So it was actually bubbling hot.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.287
I'm not exaggerating,
it wasn't bubbling hot.

16:05.390 --> 16:07.591
- I don't find it funny.
- Okay.

16:07.692 --> 16:10.527
Can I have a word on my
own with the owners, please?

16:10.628 --> 16:13.629
You guys get back to whatever you be doing.

16:13.730 --> 16:17.065
I'm not gonna say this
in front of your staff.

16:19.469 --> 16:22.371
You're a joke.

16:22.472 --> 16:23.406
The food was disgusting.

16:23.507 --> 16:25.908
- Everything was off?
- Everything.

16:26.009 --> 16:27.809
And that's without factoring in the prices.

16:27.910 --> 16:30.211
Going through each and every dish,

16:30.312 --> 16:32.547
there was a... a consistent pattern.

16:32.648 --> 16:36.350
It's like you've shut
shop up and gone home.

16:36.452 --> 16:40.988
Chappy is not very happy.

16:41.089 --> 16:43.391
- Are you done?
- With what?

16:43.491 --> 16:45.626
- Just cooking in general.
- No.

16:45.727 --> 16:48.629
- That's you at your best?
- Pardon?

16:48.730 --> 16:52.131
- That's you at your best?
- Kind of.

16:52.232 --> 16:53.766
Really?

16:53.867 --> 16:58.170
Uh, I've toned down some
spices for Nashville.

16:58.271 --> 17:00.706
When we first opened, people
complained on everything.

17:00.908 --> 17:03.409
- Too salty, too spicy.
- Too much heat.

17:03.510 --> 17:05.010
I'm not looking for excuses.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.546
Well, I
-... I... you know, what can I say?

17:07.646 --> 17:09.548
You asked me to help,
but I'm not gonna sit here

17:09.648 --> 17:11.450
and blow smoke up your asses
and say the food was amazing.

17:11.550 --> 17:14.886
I don't want you to blow
anything up my whatever,

17:14.987 --> 17:17.188
so let's not go here and go through this.

17:17.289 --> 17:18.589
You've said your piece, let's move on.

17:18.790 --> 17:20.892
You've given up.

17:20.893 --> 17:22.103
Given up what?

17:22.929 --> 17:24.528
Okay, I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.029
Me too.

17:27.332 --> 17:28.432
Okay.

17:28.532 --> 17:30.367
Wow.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.344
Tom, order up.

17:41.411 --> 17:42.912
Uh, Mark, how does the line work?

17:43.013 --> 17:44.948
- Fry cook...
- Fry cook. Who's frying tonight?

17:45.048 --> 17:46.449
- Grill.
- Chappy.

17:46.550 --> 17:48.050
- I'm frying tonight.
- Okay, great.

17:49.753 --> 17:51.588
Oysters. Wow.

17:51.689 --> 17:54.090
- Chappy, do they stay out like that?
- _

17:54.124 --> 17:55.048
You are kidding me, aren't you?

17:55.049 --> 17:56.172
_

17:56.173 --> 17:58.147
_

17:58.149 --> 17:59.928
Wow.

18:00.229 --> 18:01.286
_

18:02.331 --> 18:03.732
Listen, I'm not that dumb.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.433
- Now you just put ice in there to chill the temperature.
- I know.

18:05.535 --> 18:07.068
"Throw some ice in, I'll check it.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.471
I want to look good."

18:12.073 --> 18:13.407
All right, now we got the first ticket.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.711
We got a grilled grouper working.

18:16.812 --> 18:18.813
Chappy, you fry the grouper with the beef?

18:18.914 --> 18:20.948
- We blacken everything in the same pan.
- Yes.

18:21.049 --> 18:23.117
What happens if the customer
was was a pescatarian?

18:23.251 --> 18:25.653
- A pescatarian?
- Yeah, they only eat fish.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.254
And they don't expect to eat
their fish with meat juices.

18:28.355 --> 18:29.990
I've never heard of one,
to tell you the truth.

18:30.090 --> 18:33.092
My God.

18:34.595 --> 18:36.329
Wow. I can't believe that's going out.

18:36.430 --> 18:38.732
Uh, Tom, take me to that table.

18:40.635 --> 18:41.935
Thank you. Sorry for interrupting.

18:42.036 --> 18:43.769
- Are you a pescatarian?
- I am.

18:43.870 --> 18:44.870
Can I borrow you for two seconds?

18:44.971 --> 18:47.472
- Would you mind? Thank you.
- Sure. Yeah.

18:47.574 --> 18:48.507
Chappy, have you got two seconds?

18:48.675 --> 18:50.876
- This is one of your customers.
- Really?

18:50.977 --> 18:52.110
Let me explain something really important,

18:52.211 --> 18:53.045
'cause I'm not [Bleep] around now.

18:53.112 --> 18:54.312
This lady is a pescatarian.

18:54.414 --> 18:56.615
Strictly fish. What I'm trying to explain,

18:56.716 --> 18:58.751
'cause you're not
listening, is that her fish

18:58.852 --> 19:00.451
was cooked in there along with the beef.

19:00.553 --> 19:02.053
It's not a general practice.

19:02.087 --> 19:03.555
It's just something you never do.

19:03.656 --> 19:04.956
It's the golden rule, but
he's totally oblivious.

19:05.057 --> 19:07.692
- Do you get sick on meat?
- Oh, very.

19:07.793 --> 19:09.994
I'm sorry.

19:10.095 --> 19:13.932
I'll make sure that's in a pan
of its own, as it should be,

19:14.033 --> 19:15.232
and cooked properly. Okay? My apologies.

19:15.434 --> 19:17.434
- I appreciate that.
- Thank you.

19:17.535 --> 19:20.336
It's cooked in the same stuff
that the meat's been cooked in.

19:20.438 --> 19:21.672
Ooh!

19:21.773 --> 19:22.773
Oh, my gosh.

19:22.874 --> 19:25.375
And it's disgusting back there.

19:25.476 --> 19:29.312
Why is... ugh.

19:29.413 --> 19:32.114
Why is the mayonnaise that color?

19:34.117 --> 19:35.952
I thought that was a jar of mustard.

19:36.053 --> 19:38.854
What's the date on this?

19:38.956 --> 19:43.092
"Sell by 27 February 2010."

19:43.193 --> 19:46.996
Expired three years ago. My God.

19:47.097 --> 19:49.497
What's that?

19:52.534 --> 19:55.036
How old is that?

19:55.137 --> 19:57.973
Raw beef and cooked beef.

19:58.074 --> 20:00.475
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.277
As I always say, everything
you need to know about a chef

20:03.378 --> 20:04.578
is in his fridge.

20:04.679 --> 20:07.815
Shrimp. They're stuck there.

20:07.916 --> 20:11.418
Sad. Absolutely stinking.

20:11.519 --> 20:16.456
Oh, my God. Look at that.

20:16.557 --> 20:18.258
What in the [Bleep] is that?

20:18.459 --> 20:20.693
There's a shrimp hanging
down. That's all mold.

20:20.794 --> 20:22.996
Unbelievable. Bloody hell.

20:29.366 --> 20:30.766
It's dinner service at Chappy's,

20:30.867 --> 20:33.169
and Chef Ramsay has just
made a shocking discovery...

20:33.270 --> 20:35.305
Oh, my God. That's all mold.

20:35.406 --> 20:36.839
Bloody hell.

20:36.907 --> 20:39.008
What may be the filthiest fridge

20:39.110 --> 20:40.110
he has ever seen.

20:40.244 --> 20:43.346
What a mess.

20:43.447 --> 20:45.547
- Do you have a minute? Urgently, please.
- Yes, sir.

20:45.648 --> 20:46.648
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

20:46.749 --> 20:50.285
Chappy, can I have you
for a minute, please?

20:50.386 --> 20:53.088
This fridge is an absolute mess.

20:53.189 --> 20:55.690
I have never seen that, ever!

20:55.791 --> 20:58.927
Now, I want to know what
the hell are you doing?

20:59.129 --> 21:00.928
Something must have spilled.

21:01.029 --> 21:02.830
Something must have spilled?

21:02.931 --> 21:05.266
Can you stop [Bleep] for once

21:05.367 --> 21:07.168
and just try to get real?

21:07.269 --> 21:09.870
When are these from, just out of interest?

21:09.971 --> 21:12.406
- Those are fresh potatoes.
- They are fresh today?

21:12.508 --> 21:13.707
No, they're not fresh today.

21:13.808 --> 21:16.110
Oh, my good God.

21:16.210 --> 21:17.910
Just touch that. What is that?

21:18.012 --> 21:19.646
It's warm.

21:19.747 --> 21:21.981
Have you any idea what happens to sauce

21:22.049 --> 21:23.950
when it's covered and it's hot?

21:24.051 --> 21:26.085
Tomorrow morning it's what?

21:26.187 --> 21:27.687
- Sour.
- Sour. Thank you.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.088
And when is this from?

21:29.190 --> 21:31.691
- This is a cake that we...
- This is a cake.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.325
You can't even answer me now.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.528
How old is that?

21:35.629 --> 21:38.130
- I don't know.
- Oh, my good God.

21:38.231 --> 21:39.532
See the mold in these things?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.267
- Yes.
- And this one here.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.669
- Look, see that there?
- Hmm.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.371
You stop. You're not getting anything.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.573
86 it. Come here, you. Come here.

21:47.674 --> 21:50.508
- Yeah, have a look down there. What do you see?
- Mold.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.482
Mold. And you want me to let you
take something outside of here?

21:52.483 --> 21:53.105
No.

21:53.106 --> 21:54.512
- Now [Bleep] off.
- Yes, sir.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.048
Have you any idea how long

21:57.149 --> 21:59.850
a shrimp needs to stay inside a fridge

21:59.951 --> 22:02.053
to get that much mold on there?

22:02.188 --> 22:03.288
No. Is it between the...

22:03.389 --> 22:04.688
Is it between the what?

22:04.789 --> 22:05.689
I don't know what it is, where it was.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.792
All night, you're just deflecting.

22:08.893 --> 22:12.229
How about some form of honesty?

22:12.330 --> 22:14.531
He needs some help, obviously.

22:14.632 --> 22:15.532
He needs some help?

22:15.633 --> 22:18.068
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious about...

22:18.169 --> 22:20.836
You are one foot away from
that [Bleep] down there.

22:20.870 --> 22:23.872
- Which he obviously didn't know was down there.
- What?

22:23.973 --> 22:26.008
Well, do you think he would
have let it stay down there

22:26.109 --> 22:27.310
if he knew it was there?

22:27.411 --> 22:29.512
- Oh, so he couldn't see it?
- Obviously not.

22:29.613 --> 22:31.414
You have raised the bar.

22:31.515 --> 22:33.949
In fact, you, right now, are a legend.

22:34.050 --> 22:36.351
'Cause you have raised
the bar so [Bleep] high

22:36.452 --> 22:38.152
that you've taught every chef in the world

22:38.254 --> 22:39.554
how not to cook.

22:39.655 --> 22:42.591
Congratulations.

22:42.692 --> 22:44.693
I feel horrible.

22:46.195 --> 22:48.763
Seeing that fridge was beyond belief.

22:48.931 --> 22:50.432
I could not believe it.

22:50.533 --> 22:55.569
I had no idea. I just am speechless.

22:55.670 --> 22:59.072
Starr, you and me for a second.

22:59.173 --> 23:00.974
What is going on?

23:01.075 --> 23:02.276
I have no idea.

23:02.377 --> 23:03.711
I don't go in the walk-in cooler.

23:03.811 --> 23:06.313
I don't manage it. It's not my territory.

23:06.414 --> 23:08.615
I never even thought to look in it.

23:08.716 --> 23:12.552
I am mortified. I am embarrassed by that.

23:12.753 --> 23:14.654
You've got every right
to defend your husband,

23:14.755 --> 23:16.556
but I'm not here to sugarcoat.

23:16.657 --> 23:18.491
- I understand.
- And you're right to be mortified.

23:18.592 --> 23:20.192
And I don't expect you to sugarcoat it.

23:20.294 --> 23:22.194
But I need some form of understanding...

23:22.296 --> 23:24.896
you cannot perform like that.

23:24.997 --> 23:26.732
You must see the problem, surely.

23:26.832 --> 23:28.433
I surely do.

23:28.534 --> 23:30.135
What's happened to him?

23:30.236 --> 23:32.370
I don't know what's happened to him.

23:32.437 --> 23:36.173
If I knew, I could help
him work through it.

23:36.275 --> 23:40.311
I can't start to work with
someone that's given up.

23:40.412 --> 23:43.914
And right now, he's shown me everything

23:44.015 --> 23:46.116
to confirm he's done just that.

23:46.217 --> 23:49.452
And honestly, hand on heart,

23:49.553 --> 23:50.853
I think I'm too late.

23:50.954 --> 23:53.356
Oh, jeez.

23:53.457 --> 23:56.092
It doesn't seem like he cares.

23:56.193 --> 23:57.594
No, he does care.

23:57.695 --> 23:59.095
How do you know?

23:59.196 --> 24:01.798
I don't know. Let me go talk to him.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.537
What changed?

24:08.638 --> 24:10.773
What changed him

24:10.873 --> 24:13.875
from being so passionate and energetic

24:13.976 --> 24:16.378
into almost apathetic?

24:16.479 --> 24:18.614
I love you too.

24:26.054 --> 24:27.755
I know I'm ready, and whatever it takes,

24:27.856 --> 24:30.958
Chappy's gonna have to come up and meet me,

24:31.059 --> 24:32.493
and let's do this together.

24:32.594 --> 24:35.895
Wow.

24:37.097 --> 24:39.433
[Bleep] hell.

24:41.336 --> 24:43.737
- I'm totally mortified and embarrassed.
- I know.

24:43.838 --> 24:46.072
So show some life.

24:46.173 --> 24:48.375
Show that you care.

24:48.476 --> 24:50.877
Or we have done all of this for nothing.

24:51.078 --> 24:52.578
I know.

24:57.718 --> 25:00.018
I think Chef Ramsay nailed it.

25:00.119 --> 25:03.856
And I feel a little let down.

25:04.441 --> 25:06.119
_

25:06.120 --> 25:08.866
_

25:19.822 --> 25:22.256
At last night's dinner service,

25:22.357 --> 25:25.359
Chef Ramsay was horrified
at the bad practices.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.861
Sit down, please.

25:26.962 --> 25:28.863
This morning, he has gathered the staff

25:28.964 --> 25:31.700
to see if he can uncover
any other major issues

25:31.801 --> 25:33.401
with the restaurant.

25:33.502 --> 25:35.136
You know, I came here to help.

25:35.204 --> 25:37.338
But my biggest concern right now is Chappy.

25:37.439 --> 25:39.940
- Mm-hmm.
- I can't think of a more dangerous job.

25:40.041 --> 25:42.843
When you've got an owner at
the helm that doesn't care.

25:42.944 --> 25:44.178
Have you ever tried to talk to him?

25:44.279 --> 25:46.180
You even bother to ask him a question,

25:46.281 --> 25:48.683
and you are pissing him off.

25:48.783 --> 25:50.884
The other day, a guest wanted to know

25:50.985 --> 25:52.519
what was in a sauce, so I asked him.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.421
He said, "why the [Bleep]
do you want to know?"

25:54.522 --> 25:57.324
The condescending and the rudeness,

25:57.425 --> 25:59.659
and the yelling where
the customers can hear,

25:59.760 --> 26:01.361
that's really, really bad.

26:01.462 --> 26:04.163
I feel like I always get yelled at a lot,

26:04.265 --> 26:05.765
just for everything.

26:05.866 --> 26:08.601
He shuts you down, snaps at you.

26:08.702 --> 26:10.302
You're not even allowed to speak to him

26:10.403 --> 26:11.503
until he speaks to you.

26:11.605 --> 26:13.004
Is he always that condescending?

26:13.106 --> 26:14.540
- Absolutely.
- Yes. Yes.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.342
He always think everybody's
after... he thinks the waiters,

26:16.443 --> 26:18.344
all we care about is our
money, and nothing else.

26:18.445 --> 26:20.045
Everybody's stealing from him.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.980
- Everybody's against him?
- Everybody!

26:22.081 --> 26:24.282
What's it like dealing with
complaints in the kitchen?

26:24.383 --> 26:25.883
He usually gets upset.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.485
He gets angry.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.520
"There's nothing wrong
with this." He'll taste it.

26:29.622 --> 26:32.123
He blames everything on us or the guests.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.325
- Give me an example.
- I had a coconut cake

26:34.426 --> 26:36.026
that was returned to me. I
brought it back to Chappy.

26:36.128 --> 26:39.063
- He dug it out of the trashcan...
- What?

26:39.164 --> 26:41.064
Went back and asked the
guy what was wrong with it.

26:41.165 --> 26:43.567
From the trash? Not good.

26:43.668 --> 26:45.201
Is he different now that I'm here?

26:45.303 --> 26:46.803
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Definitely.

26:46.904 --> 26:48.204
- In what way?
- He's calmer.

26:48.306 --> 26:49.506
- He's calmer.
- He's calmer, yeah.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.141
I appreciate everybody's honesty.

26:51.208 --> 26:54.544
This is about getting
better, let me tell you.

26:54.579 --> 26:57.346
So as difficult as it may be on you

26:57.447 --> 27:02.485
to say what you've said to
me... to the man himself.

27:02.586 --> 27:03.986
No matter what happens, I've got your back.

27:04.087 --> 27:06.822
So be confident, be honest.

27:06.923 --> 27:08.724
For me to tell Chappy what I'm feeling

27:08.825 --> 27:11.927
and what's been going on,
it's definitely nerve-racking.

27:12.028 --> 27:13.127
Here they are.

27:13.228 --> 27:14.562
I don't know what he's gonna do.

27:14.664 --> 27:15.664
I don't know if he's gonna fire me,

27:15.765 --> 27:17.064
or how he's gonna accept it.

27:17.166 --> 27:19.668
Chappy's usually a person
who flies off the handle.

27:19.769 --> 27:21.703
They have some things to say.

27:21.804 --> 27:24.806
Susan, kick it off, please.

27:24.907 --> 27:26.641
The main thing, Chappy,
is just communicating,

27:26.709 --> 27:28.509
so we're on the same page.

27:28.643 --> 27:29.743
Russ.

27:29.844 --> 27:33.547
I want to preface what I have to say

27:33.648 --> 27:35.148
to both of you... I love you both.

27:35.249 --> 27:36.483
I love this restaurant.

27:36.584 --> 27:38.385
Russell, I love the love.

27:38.486 --> 27:40.987
Please tell me. Please tell me.

27:41.088 --> 27:47.727
Chappy, you're condescending,
you're rude, and you're abusive.

27:47.828 --> 27:50.530
Everybody feels it. I don't
think anybody wants to say it.

27:50.664 --> 27:52.665
And many times you lose your temper,

27:52.766 --> 27:55.368
and customers can hear you.

27:55.469 --> 27:58.371
It's hard for us to work in that condition.

27:58.472 --> 28:00.005
It seems to me as though

28:00.106 --> 28:02.607
you don't give a [Bleep]
about us as a team out here.

28:02.709 --> 28:05.510
That you think we're all against you,

28:05.611 --> 28:07.045
and that we don't have your back.

28:07.146 --> 28:09.280
And I want you to know
that we do have your back.

28:09.449 --> 28:11.650
We would love to have
some support back from you.

28:11.751 --> 28:13.852
It's just hard that you don't trust anyone.

28:13.953 --> 28:17.788
If you don't trust your staff,
then don't [Bleep] hire 'em.

28:17.889 --> 28:19.790
- Derek.
- When I first started working,

28:19.891 --> 28:21.925
I was selling the blackened
redfish to everybody.

28:22.026 --> 28:24.928
But I found out later that it was swai.

28:25.029 --> 28:27.431
And ethically, as a
server, you're asking me

28:27.532 --> 28:30.000
to go out and lie to
these people every night.

28:30.068 --> 28:32.969
- Is that true?
- It's true.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.170
And, you know, it's just not right.

28:34.271 --> 28:35.805
Why'd you do that?

28:35.906 --> 28:37.206
Why'd you swap that fish out and put...

28:37.307 --> 28:39.208
- I was trying to substitute.
- No, stop, stop, stop.

28:39.309 --> 28:40.410
Being dishonest with customers

28:40.511 --> 28:42.345
and putting them in the firing line...

28:42.413 --> 28:45.849
If he gets called out, it's your doing.

28:45.949 --> 28:47.450
I just wish he would, like,
listen to us a little bit.

28:47.551 --> 28:49.852
Anytime I've brought up an idea

28:49.952 --> 28:51.387
or even try to ask you a question,

28:51.488 --> 28:52.788
I'm wasting your time.

28:52.889 --> 28:54.490
Whoa. I try to have your back.

28:54.591 --> 28:56.091
You're fantastic.

28:56.192 --> 29:01.363
I'm directing this more towards Chappy.

29:04.066 --> 29:07.402
A lot of things have to change.

29:07.436 --> 29:10.304
I appreciate everything you say.

29:10.406 --> 29:13.240
And you're right on target.

29:13.341 --> 29:15.142
Chappy...

29:15.243 --> 29:17.545
do you find this kind of feedback

29:17.646 --> 29:19.580
from your team helpful?

29:25.286 --> 29:27.821
I do.

29:27.922 --> 29:29.222
It does get tough.

29:29.323 --> 29:32.225
And if I was negative to
you of a personal event,

29:32.326 --> 29:34.027
apologize. It wasn't meant to hurt.

29:34.128 --> 29:37.062
Sometimes I get off the edge too.

29:37.163 --> 29:39.865
I'm so blessed that this has happened,

29:39.966 --> 29:42.668
because nothing was gonna
change unless we went

29:42.769 --> 29:44.702
all the way down there,
put the light on it,

29:44.804 --> 29:51.043
looked at it and said,
"whoa! Let's fix this."

29:51.144 --> 29:53.645
We have slacked off for quite some time,

29:53.746 --> 29:57.149
but we'll get back to it.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.584
I hope Chappy can change.

29:59.685 --> 30:00.784
I know sometimes they say you can't

30:00.885 --> 30:02.886
teach an old dog new tricks,

30:02.988 --> 30:05.489
but I'm hoping that you can.

30:05.623 --> 30:08.725
Chef Ramsay still remains unconvinced

30:08.827 --> 30:11.028
that Chappy has seen the error of his ways.

30:11.129 --> 30:14.265
Sir, have you heard of
the restaurant Chappy's?

30:14.366 --> 30:16.466
So he has provided Chappy and
Starr with a fully equipped

30:16.567 --> 30:18.501
stakeout vehicle, so they can monitor

30:18.569 --> 30:20.170
his interaction with the locals.

30:20.271 --> 30:22.705
Hello. How are you?

30:22.806 --> 30:24.507
Nice to see you. You like cajun?

30:24.608 --> 30:26.909
- We love cajun.
- Have you heard of Chappy's?

30:27.011 --> 30:27.910
- Yes.
- You have heard of Chappy's?

30:28.012 --> 30:29.145
- Yes, we have.
- Good.

30:29.246 --> 30:30.246
Have you been there?

30:30.348 --> 30:31.948
- Yes, a couple of times.
- We have been.

30:32.048 --> 30:34.850
A couple of times. Tell
me the experience, please.

30:34.985 --> 30:37.186
Big on show. Very... wants to spend

30:37.287 --> 30:39.188
all his time and money
on promoting himself.

30:39.289 --> 30:40.990
We had the etouffée when we went

30:41.091 --> 30:43.825
and probably one of the
worst dishes you've had?

30:43.926 --> 30:44.826
Yeah, it tasted a little burnt.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.128
A little bit burnt. Wow.

30:46.229 --> 30:47.329
- I appreciate your honesty.
- Absolutely.

30:47.430 --> 30:49.930
- Thank you, my darling.
- Thank you so much.

30:50.032 --> 30:51.532
Have you heard of Chappy's, the restaurant?

30:51.666 --> 30:52.766
You haven't heard of it. Thank you.

30:52.868 --> 30:54.568
How are you? Have you heard of Chappy's?

30:54.636 --> 30:56.170
- I have.
- Good. Good, good, good.

30:56.171 --> 30:58.072
- Have you been to Chappy's?
- I have been.

30:58.173 --> 30:59.507
I didn't feel it was real authentic cajun.

30:59.574 --> 31:01.309
Looking for etouffée and andouille

31:01.310 --> 31:02.310
and good oysters and shrimp.

31:02.411 --> 31:03.777
Simple stuff, spicy.

31:04.012 --> 31:05.078
They have that kind of food there.

31:05.213 --> 31:06.513
Did you try it?

31:06.870 --> 31:08.390
What I tried was not great.

31:09.817 --> 31:12.019
I eat better cajun food
on the cajun food truck

31:12.120 --> 31:14.154
that rolls around.

31:14.255 --> 31:15.555
The food quality is sub par,

31:18.759 --> 31:21.494
I wouldn't mind to pay $30
to $40 for a good entrée

31:21.594 --> 31:23.295
but it wasn't good.

31:23.397 --> 31:25.197
It's not authentic cajun.

31:25.298 --> 31:27.099
Bad food, bad atmosphere.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.136
- Really?
- Bad hat.

31:30.237 --> 31:31.237
I'm here to help fix that restaurant.

31:31.338 --> 31:32.738
- Will you bear with me...
- Yes.

31:32.839 --> 31:33.939
- And give it one more shot?
- Yes.

31:34.041 --> 31:36.441
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- Thanks.

31:36.575 --> 31:38.476
Bye-bye.

31:43.815 --> 31:45.716
Okay, were you listening?

31:45.817 --> 31:47.118
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

31:47.219 --> 31:48.520
Tough to watch.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.321
I agree. It is tough to watch.

31:50.423 --> 31:52.656
You think you're doing
something that they want,

31:52.690 --> 31:54.658
and then they don't.

31:54.759 --> 31:56.060
So it's a good eye-awakening,

31:56.161 --> 31:58.995
an epiphany of what we need to do.

31:59.097 --> 32:00.730
Less show, more quality.

32:00.798 --> 32:03.934
- Absolutely.
- That's... that's... in a nutshell.

32:04.001 --> 32:05.802
Time to move forward. Agreed?

32:05.903 --> 32:07.637
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

32:07.738 --> 32:09.338
Well, when you hear people
talking on the street,

32:09.440 --> 32:10.639
and they don't see you listening,

32:10.740 --> 32:12.442
they'll say things that maybe

32:12.543 --> 32:13.543
they wouldn't say in front of you.

32:13.643 --> 32:16.679
It was an eye-opener.

32:16.780 --> 32:18.414
Coming up...

32:18.482 --> 32:20.383
- Chappy, listen to me.
- No.

32:20.484 --> 32:22.017
All eyes are on Chappy.

32:22.119 --> 32:24.519
I need you to step up
to the plate or go home.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.322
Will he finally lead his team
to a successful service...

32:27.423 --> 32:29.057
- How long, Chappy?
- Almost ready.

32:29.158 --> 32:31.859
Or will his customers
be disappointed again?

32:31.961 --> 32:33.861
Chappy, stop what you're doing. Stop!

32:34.063 --> 32:36.064
That's coming up on Kitchen Nightmares.

32:36.165 --> 32:38.200
That would be one pain in my ass gone.

32:46.031 --> 32:48.032
After setting Chappy, hopefully,

32:48.133 --> 32:49.233
on the path to change,

32:49.334 --> 32:52.069
Chef Ramsay and his team
work through the night

32:52.170 --> 32:54.872
on a major renovation.

32:57.909 --> 32:58.843
Good morning.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.710
Good morning.

33:00.911 --> 33:02.311
Get ready for some big changes.

33:02.412 --> 33:03.412
Let's get on with it.

33:04.514 --> 33:06.750
Please remove your blindfolds.

33:06.851 --> 33:08.251
Ah!

33:10.154 --> 33:12.155
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, man.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.489
Oh, my God.

33:13.590 --> 33:14.991
Welcome to the new Chappy's.

33:15.092 --> 33:16.992
- That's nice. Look at that.
- Awesome.

33:17.093 --> 33:19.094
How incredibly cool.

33:19.195 --> 33:22.030
Gone are those tacky, dated yellow walls.

33:22.132 --> 33:24.633
Now it's comfortable, modern.

33:24.734 --> 33:26.235
Much more warm and inviting.

33:26.335 --> 33:28.771
- Yeah.
- We got rid of a lot of the chairs

33:28.872 --> 33:30.172
and replaced them with
pews, so you get that

33:30.273 --> 33:32.173
sort of intimate, sort of family feel.

33:32.374 --> 33:34.475
So much better. I love it.

33:34.609 --> 33:36.710
- Take a look at this wall.
- Mm-hmm.

33:36.812 --> 33:39.413
We have reclaimed wood from a local bar,

33:39.514 --> 33:42.150
- and then added artistic photos.
- Uh-huh, the French Quarter.

33:42.251 --> 33:43.584
- You recognize it?
- Oh, of course.

33:43.652 --> 33:45.753
We got rid of all the
clutter from Mardi Gras,

33:45.854 --> 33:47.655
- including Miss Cleo.
- Yeah!

33:47.756 --> 33:49.289
Yeah.

33:49.356 --> 33:52.292
- It's the ambiance that Nashville wants.
- Yeah.

33:52.393 --> 33:56.096
And it still pays homage to
the home of cajun cuisine.

33:56.197 --> 33:57.330
Starr, how do you feel?

34:01.235 --> 34:03.036
- You happy, my darling?
- Absolutely.

34:03.137 --> 34:04.336
- You like it?
- Yes!

34:04.437 --> 34:05.871
Perfect.

34:05.972 --> 34:07.673
- It's absolutely perfect.
- It is absolutely stunning.

34:07.774 --> 34:10.876
I love it. Everything's so fresh.

34:10.976 --> 34:12.610
So clean, so modern.

34:12.712 --> 34:15.714
It just oozes New Orleans charm.

34:15.815 --> 34:17.817
Do we have a happy Chappy?

34:17.918 --> 34:20.150
- It's very, very nice.
- Mm-hmm.

34:20.252 --> 34:22.553
It's not my style, but
I was just gonna kinda

34:22.654 --> 34:25.255
grin, bear it, move on.

34:25.357 --> 34:26.389
Thank you, sir.

34:26.491 --> 34:28.592
Thank you.

34:28.694 --> 34:30.695
Yeah.

34:30.795 --> 34:32.763
All right, all right.

34:32.797 --> 34:35.733
Now, as big as the decor change was,

34:35.833 --> 34:37.766
the menu change is even bigger.

34:37.835 --> 34:38.936
Let's go through the
menu from top to bottom.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.237
Chef Ramsay has modernized

34:40.338 --> 34:44.875
and reduced the menu from 100 dishes to 22.

34:44.976 --> 34:46.877
First of all, that is the only page.

34:46.978 --> 34:49.646
Yes! Yes!

34:49.714 --> 34:51.815
Let's start off at the
top. Shrimp and grits,

34:51.915 --> 34:54.217
done with creole seasoning,
onions, and tomato.

34:54.318 --> 34:55.417
Delicious.

34:55.518 --> 34:57.085
Next to that,

34:57.154 --> 34:58.955
blackened redfish served with citronelle

34:59.056 --> 35:00.356
and a herb salad.

35:00.457 --> 35:02.859
And what do we do when we've
run out of redfish, Chappy?

35:02.960 --> 35:04.793
- It's 86ed.
- 86.

35:04.895 --> 35:05.895
- That's right.

35:05.996 --> 35:07.396
So don't even ask for it!

35:07.497 --> 35:10.098
Fried chicken served with apple butter.

35:10.199 --> 35:14.236
Delicious apple butter.
Absolutely delicious.

35:14.337 --> 35:17.038
Chappy, you've gone quiet.

35:17.139 --> 35:18.173
I'm thinking...

35:18.274 --> 35:20.775
how we're gonna do it.

35:20.809 --> 35:23.278
Let me tell you something.

35:23.379 --> 35:25.712
Your cooks have been here
since early this morning.

35:25.813 --> 35:27.314
They have been under the guidance

35:27.415 --> 35:29.116
of a great chef that I brought here...

35:29.217 --> 35:30.918
Chris Fox. Chris.

35:31.019 --> 35:33.153
- Good morning.
- Good morning, guys.

35:33.255 --> 35:35.189
This young man has been
cooking for over 15 years.

35:35.357 --> 35:37.424
He has the most amazing
wealth of experience.

35:37.458 --> 35:39.860
- Wonderful.
- I paid for Chris to be here

35:39.994 --> 35:41.494
to really implement these standards

35:41.595 --> 35:43.496
after I have gone.

35:43.597 --> 35:46.499
I think Chef Chris is such a blessing.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.301
Chappy's gonna get a
chance to work side by side

35:48.402 --> 35:49.936
with this gentleman.

35:50.137 --> 35:53.039
So there are no excuses. Okay?

35:53.140 --> 35:55.041
There's something else I need to bring in.

35:55.142 --> 35:57.075
- Uniforms.
- Oh, wow! Yeah!

35:58.177 --> 36:00.078
Oh, my God.

36:00.179 --> 36:03.081
The uniforms are great. Now it's casual.

36:03.182 --> 36:05.918
And this whole new image,
it's gonna be fantastic.

36:06.019 --> 36:07.719
It feels appropriate. No white shirt,

36:07.820 --> 36:09.521
no bowtie, no black pants.

36:09.622 --> 36:13.557
And, talking about pants, one more thing.

36:16.361 --> 36:19.296
When you're looking the part...

36:19.397 --> 36:20.596
There goes the party
hat and the clown pants.

36:20.697 --> 36:21.998
I love it.

36:22.099 --> 36:24.500
Listen, what I'd like you all to do now

36:24.601 --> 36:26.102
is to dig in and taste the food.

36:26.203 --> 36:28.138
Oh, my gosh.

36:28.239 --> 36:29.439
That pork chop is ridiculous.

36:29.540 --> 36:30.740
Oh, my God.

36:30.841 --> 36:32.242
There is no comparison
between Chappy's old food

36:32.343 --> 36:33.443
and Chappy's new food.

36:33.544 --> 36:35.277
The recipes are there, the flavor is there.

36:35.378 --> 36:37.579
But I'm not totally
convinced that he's happy.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.381
I think he's still, like,
got all these thoughts,

36:39.482 --> 36:40.782
like, pondering and wondering.

36:40.883 --> 36:43.118
So we'll see how that goes.

36:43.219 --> 36:45.421
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

36:53.062 --> 36:55.763
Okay, that side down. Push nice and flat.

36:55.864 --> 36:58.466
After more training on the
new menu with Chef Ramsay

36:58.500 --> 37:01.102
- and Chef Chris...
- Get it really super-charred, right?

37:01.203 --> 37:03.804
- You'll have beautiful marks. It'll look great.
- Got it.

37:03.905 --> 37:05.840
All the tools are there for Chappy

37:05.941 --> 37:07.574
to have a successful relaunch.

37:07.741 --> 37:10.643
- I think I'm gonna do the grilled Angus steak.
- Okay.

37:10.744 --> 37:11.778
Yeah, I actually want to try the crab cake.

37:11.879 --> 37:13.080
- It looks awesome.
- Crab cake?

37:13.181 --> 37:15.382
All right. Thanks, guys.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.585
Fire 114. Two pork chops, two Angus steaks.

37:18.719 --> 37:21.721
One medium, one med-rare.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.156
- Ugh!
- Uh, Chappy...

37:24.224 --> 37:26.758
- Call back, please.
- Pork chop heard.

37:26.860 --> 37:28.060
Heard. Serious, please, yeah?

37:28.161 --> 37:30.863
I got you. Chappy, Chris is expediting.

37:30.964 --> 37:33.199
He's gonna tell you what to do, just do it.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.401
How long on these steaks?

37:35.502 --> 37:37.603
- How long, Chappy?
- Almost ready.

37:37.704 --> 37:39.104
[Bleep] hell. Chris.

37:39.205 --> 37:41.039
Like, what does "almost"
mean? Like five seconds,

37:41.140 --> 37:42.540
two seconds, three seconds, one second?

37:42.641 --> 37:48.480
Give me a time, please.

37:48.580 --> 37:50.382
Chappy, I'm not asking
for the fastest kitchen,

37:50.483 --> 37:51.983
I just want a little bit of call back...

37:52.018 --> 37:53.284
"Yes, Chef, no, Chef."

37:53.386 --> 37:54.685
A little bit of liveliness
in here a little bit.

37:56.021 --> 37:57.021
[Bleep] hell.

37:57.122 --> 37:58.322
Here's your medium-rare.

37:58.423 --> 37:59.823
I needed two pork chops.

37:59.924 --> 38:01.225
Where's the pork chop, please?

38:01.326 --> 38:04.428
I need those pork chops desperately.

38:04.462 --> 38:05.962
Chappy, get in the game
a little bit, please.

38:05.997 --> 38:07.164
They're in the oven.

38:07.365 --> 38:09.166
They should have been put in
the oven a while ago, though.

38:09.267 --> 38:10.501
Yeah? They've been in.

38:10.601 --> 38:12.235
It's gotta be quicker
than that. [Bleep] me.

38:12.302 --> 38:13.903
We haven't sent anything yet.

38:14.004 --> 38:16.506
It's almost like we've gone to sleep.

38:16.606 --> 38:17.840
As Chappy struggles with the new menu,

38:17.941 --> 38:19.842
the question is is it because it's new,

38:19.943 --> 38:22.545
or is it because he's not
thrilled about serving it?

38:22.646 --> 38:24.680
I'm having such a hard time
serving a plate like that.

38:24.781 --> 38:26.115
Whatever the case may be,

38:26.183 --> 38:28.483
customers are starting to get impatient.

38:30.786 --> 38:33.522
- Let's go, I need those chops.
- We already look like jerks.

38:33.622 --> 38:35.524
- Wow.
- I need 114.

38:35.624 --> 38:37.125
I need 129.

38:37.226 --> 38:39.428
I'm also ready for 110.

38:39.562 --> 38:42.364
Oh, my God. If Chappy would listen,

38:42.465 --> 38:43.964
it would be so much better.

38:44.066 --> 38:46.267
Chappy. Chappy, listen to me.

38:46.368 --> 38:47.501
Something you're not very good at doing.

38:47.602 --> 38:49.002
Stop what you're doing. Stop!

38:57.415 --> 39:00.116
I need 114. I need 129.

39:00.217 --> 39:02.753
It's relaunch night, and
Chappy is not responding

39:02.854 --> 39:03.854
to Chef Chris.

39:03.955 --> 39:05.455
We haven't sent anything yet.

39:05.456 --> 39:07.000
_

39:06.957 --> 39:08.490
And Chef Ramsay knows

39:08.592 --> 39:11.293
he has to do something to save the service.

39:11.494 --> 39:12.494
Chappy, listen to me.

39:12.596 --> 39:14.196
Something you're not very good at doing.

39:14.297 --> 39:17.033
Come here a minute.

39:17.133 --> 39:19.435
This is it now.

39:19.536 --> 39:20.736
- I understand.
- No, no...

39:20.837 --> 39:22.971
- But if you understand, I need to hear you.
- I do.

39:23.072 --> 39:24.472
I cannot deliver any more.

39:24.574 --> 39:26.174
I need you to step up to the plate

39:26.275 --> 39:27.776
- and run your restaurant.
- Got it.

39:27.877 --> 39:28.877
Either do it or go home.

39:28.978 --> 39:30.311
- Got it.
- Let's go.

39:30.412 --> 39:33.514
Let's go.

39:33.616 --> 39:35.016
He's not good at listening, that one.

39:35.117 --> 39:36.117
Fire 110.

39:36.218 --> 39:38.251
Pork chop, shrimp and grits.

39:38.352 --> 39:41.055
Chappy, don't ignore
that ticket there, 110.

39:41.155 --> 39:42.155
[Bleep].

39:42.256 --> 39:43.657
I need those pork chops.

39:43.792 --> 39:44.892
You want me to butterfly 'em?

39:44.993 --> 39:46.794
Do not butterfly them. How long are they?

39:46.895 --> 39:47.995
Gonna be a couple minutes.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.797
At least three minutes, four minutes.

39:49.898 --> 39:53.233
I butterflied it off for you.

39:54.635 --> 39:55.935
You cannot do that!

39:56.036 --> 39:57.570
I don't want them all
butterflied like that.

39:57.638 --> 40:00.172
Those days have gone. I'm
not coming this far now

40:00.273 --> 40:01.273
to start stuffing food out.

40:01.374 --> 40:03.676
Uh, Chris, come around now, please.

40:03.777 --> 40:05.478
I don't want him bastardizing a full chop

40:05.579 --> 40:08.014
- just to get it out there.
- Yes, sir.

40:08.115 --> 40:09.615
You need to get it in the oven, okay?

40:09.716 --> 40:11.316
Guys, I got two Angus steak,
one medium-well, one medium.

40:11.417 --> 40:14.019
- 127, 128.
- 127, 128.

40:14.153 --> 40:17.155
- Excellent. Thank you.
- Make sure you're calling back, like, letting him know.

40:17.256 --> 40:20.258
I wish that Chappy would be
a little bit more open-minded

40:20.359 --> 40:21.593
to accept some of the changes.

40:21.694 --> 40:23.194
I really hope he does.

40:23.295 --> 40:25.430
[Bleep] hell.

40:25.498 --> 40:29.100
With Chef Chris switching
from expediter to head chef...

40:29.234 --> 40:30.635
Let's go. Urgently, please.

40:30.736 --> 40:32.136
Food is now making its way

40:32.237 --> 40:33.137
out to the dining room.

40:33.238 --> 40:35.239
Here's your food. Bon appétit.

40:35.340 --> 40:36.674
How hungry are you?

40:36.775 --> 40:38.275
Thank you. We love you.

40:38.376 --> 40:41.178
All the flavors complement
each other... it's very good.

40:41.279 --> 40:43.579
The mac and cheese is amazing.

40:43.681 --> 40:46.516
- Everybody's been happy with the food.
- Thank God.

40:46.617 --> 40:47.717
All your dinners are out?

40:47.818 --> 40:51.121
I got the last table.

40:51.221 --> 40:53.690
It's just wonderful.
We have a great new menu

40:53.758 --> 40:56.559
that's fresh and delivered beautifully.

40:56.661 --> 40:59.695
We just have to stick
with it, believe in it,

40:59.796 --> 41:02.297
and do everything we can to make it happen.

41:02.331 --> 41:04.900
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

41:05.001 --> 41:06.702
Everybody seemed to love everything,

41:06.803 --> 41:08.837
but I just have a hard time with it.

41:08.938 --> 41:11.439
I still think my food's great.

41:11.474 --> 41:14.142
That'll be one pain in my ass gone.

41:17.512 --> 41:21.683
Okay, Chappy, after
Chris's time is done here,

41:21.817 --> 41:25.019
you need to find and invest
in a Chef, like Chris.

41:25.120 --> 41:27.922
There should be someone
qualified in that kitchen

41:28.023 --> 41:29.223
on a daily basis.

41:29.357 --> 41:30.657
- Absolutely.
- 'Cause it's worth it.

41:30.758 --> 41:33.359
The only thing that's gonna
keep this place on the map

41:33.460 --> 41:36.063
- is the food.
- Will do.

41:36.164 --> 41:39.099
Starr, you must make me
a very serious promise.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.101
You must not let Chappy go backwards.

41:43.304 --> 41:45.938
- I promise.
- Good.

41:46.039 --> 41:47.940
I'm only telling you
this for your own good,

41:48.041 --> 41:49.241
'cause you are one stubborn man.

41:49.275 --> 41:50.542
Good luck to you both.

41:50.643 --> 41:52.144
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

41:52.245 --> 41:53.979
- Thank you.
- You heard my prayer.

41:54.081 --> 41:55.581
I don't know how you did it.

41:55.682 --> 41:57.783
Thank you so much.

41:57.884 --> 41:59.384
Come here, you. Ah.

41:59.485 --> 42:01.420
- Good luck to you both. Take care.
- Thank you.

42:01.521 --> 42:02.620
- Thank you so much.
- Good night.

42:02.722 --> 42:03.822
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:07.426 --> 42:10.561
I've got one word to describe
my time here at Chappy's,

42:10.662 --> 42:12.663
and that is "challenging."

42:12.765 --> 42:16.101
Mainly because Chappy let his
restaurant slide in so many ways.

42:16.202 --> 42:19.302
But we made a major
turnaround, and he even agreed

42:19.403 --> 42:21.605
to get rid of his ridiculous chef's hat.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.540
My only hope now is that he's gotten rid of

42:23.641 --> 42:25.843
all those bad habits, because if he hasn't,

42:25.944 --> 42:28.946
this restaurant has no chance.

42:29.047 --> 42:32.082
Wow.

42:33.618 --> 42:36.385
Not long after Chef Ramsay left,

42:36.486 --> 42:38.420
in spite of positive
feedback about the changes,

42:38.521 --> 42:41.124
Chappy went back to his old ways.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.025
You didn't do what I asked you.

42:43.127 --> 42:44.727
I should have come behind you
and babysat you, you're right.

42:44.828 --> 42:47.663
The majority of his
original dishes are back...

42:47.765 --> 42:50.065
Blackened pork chop,
blackened swordfish on the fly.

42:50.166 --> 42:52.667
And so is the uncertainty of the future

42:52.769 --> 42:55.503
of this Nashville restaurant.
