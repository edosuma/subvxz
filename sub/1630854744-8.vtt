00:01.000 --> 00:02.628
<i>Can you tell us about that moment,</i>

00:02.628 --> 00:04.922
<i>when you realized you might not come home?</i>

00:07.925 --> 00:08.926
It was...

00:11.470 --> 00:12.721
It was terrifying.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.355
Please, stop. Stop. Just leave that.

00:31.365 --> 00:35.452
My life had been so normal up until then.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.332
It was scary
how quickly everything changed.

00:40.332 --> 00:43.168
You a glutton for punishment?
Throw this shit away.

00:44.419 --> 00:47.464
Anything weird about that room to you?

00:47.464 --> 00:48.632
Like what?

00:48.632 --> 00:51.093
I don't know. Is it too perfect?

00:51.093 --> 00:53.095
It's called rich parents
and a housekeeper.

00:53.762 --> 00:54.805
Emily's home now,

00:54.805 --> 00:57.724
so focus on getting a confession
from the kidnapper. Okay?

00:58.559 --> 01:02.062
<i>Emily,
the entire nation watched and waited</i>

01:02.062 --> 01:05.147
<i>as the search
to find you seemed to run cold.</i>

01:05.147 --> 01:09.987
While you were locked in that cage,
how did you keep from losing faith?

01:11.029 --> 01:13.782
All the love I got
from people really saved me.

01:15.033 --> 01:20.122
It's like I could feel it, even though I,
like, didn't have my phone.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.503
So thank you, all of you.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.882
You were my squad.

02:49.628 --> 02:50.629
Hey.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.424
Why would Finney need
to pay a useless piece of shit

02:54.424 --> 02:55.884
like Bill Ochoa, huh?

02:57.845 --> 03:01.431
Listen, I had my team do a deep dive
into Bill's financials.

03:01.974 --> 03:05.686
Turns out old boy is a VC with investments
in all kinds of companies.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.230
- Yeah.
- So you've gotta ask yourself,

03:08.230 --> 03:11.817
which one of these would Finney need
for one of those mixer parties?

03:12.985 --> 03:15.988
OPD found hidden cameras
all over that house...

03:15.988 --> 03:17.781
- Bam.
- ...but they weren't able to trace

03:17.781 --> 03:19.491
where the security feed went.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.952
They said they'd never seen
such a complex system.

03:21.952 --> 03:26.540
So what we need to do is find the feed,
which means locating the server.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.419
Now look, I may have a contact.
Could get me closer to this shit.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.712
Well, let's go.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.464
No, no. Wait a minute, Poppy.
My guy, Frankie, he's--

03:36.258 --> 03:38.927
He's kinda off the grid, you know?
I have to go at this alone.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.346
- Oh, Markus.
- I know, I know, okay?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.514
You've seen it all before.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.558
Plus, you're Shreve's daughter,
so you know everything

03:44.558 --> 03:47.394
- about the streets and--
- Shreve is not my biological father.

03:50.898 --> 03:51.773
What?

03:51.773 --> 03:55.694
My mom was pregnant with me when they met.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.157
Holy shit.

04:00.657 --> 04:01.992
And then what's worse,

04:01.992 --> 04:07.456
she even went back to the man for a time,
when I was young.

04:07.456 --> 04:13.253
Just up and left me, Shreve
and baby Desiree.

04:14.546 --> 04:18.216
And you've been holding on
to this all on your own, huh?

04:19.218 --> 04:21.220
You're the only person I've told.

04:22.179 --> 04:28.185
I mean, I wanna tell Cydie and Desiree,
but the minute I do, I feel like...

04:31.063 --> 04:32.523
they'll treat me differently.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.571
Well, I got you...

04:41.573 --> 04:42.741
no matter what.

04:43.909 --> 04:48.247
You're one of my few day-ones,
and that shit ain't gonna change.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.790
Ever.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.083
Me, too.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.006
You better just go on off

04:58.006 --> 05:00.384
to meet your secret contact,

05:00.384 --> 05:03.846
and I am going to track Eva down.

05:03.846 --> 05:05.556
Even though she's not a day-one.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.101
I can tell something is off.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.395
All right, Pop. I'll call you later.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.479
Okay.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.495
For what it's worth,
Shreve and I have been discussing

05:28.495 --> 05:30.998
how to go about bringing more jobs
into the neighborhood.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.543
Sybil's been working
with a lot of teens in the community,

05:34.543 --> 05:39.423
so rest assured there will be interns
and employees of color on the payroll.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.300
Cheers to Sybil.

05:41.925 --> 05:42.926
To Sybil.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.180
- There you are, dear.
- Thank you.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.892
I've been meaning to ask you your role
at Questeur.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.603
I know you and Lee
started the company together.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.606
We did, but it's really his baby.

05:56.398 --> 06:00.277
I make appearances,
promote our philanthropy,

06:00.277 --> 06:04.489
stay on top of investors,
but the tech is where he shines.

06:04.489 --> 06:09.119
Well, I'll admit I doubted your commitment
to our community,

06:10.037 --> 06:14.166
but Lee really proved himself
when he unlocked that account for us.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.377
He did what?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.422
One of the members
of the trafficking ring was using Questeur

06:20.422 --> 06:21.924
for God knows what.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.052
Being able to see his activity
really helped the case.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.305
I heard about the ring,
but I had no idea about any of this.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.185
- I hope I didn't overstep.
- No, not at all.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.479
Lee and I lead very separate lives.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.564
I don't know
what he's doing half the time,

06:37.564 --> 06:41.485
but what he did needs
to be kept under wraps.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.655
If investors find out,
they're not gonna be happy.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.282
I mean, privacy is everything
in our business.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.367
Of course.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.507
What is this?

07:04.591 --> 07:07.761
- Peter, explain.
- I don't know what this is.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
- What am I looking at?
- That's you, Peter.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.392
That's you with Marv Lanelle,
Emily's kidnapper,

07:13.392 --> 07:16.812
- your coke dealer, who I spoke to earlier.
- I thought you'd stopped that.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.856
I did.

07:19.898 --> 07:24.403
After we got Marv's address,
we could pull CCTV footage from the area.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.907
That's you, Emily,
hours after you went missing.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.284
According to your testimony,

07:30.284 --> 07:33.203
you were blindfolded
and bound at this point, right?

07:37.541 --> 07:39.459
Can someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.752
They were conning you.

07:41.670 --> 07:42.880
Both of them.

07:43.380 --> 07:47.217
Peter's drug habit had him in debt
to his dealer, Marv.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.886
That added to his gambling debt.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.263
- Right, Peter?
- It wasn't much.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.598
100K? Not that much?

07:52.598 --> 07:55.267
I finally got Marv to fill in the blanks.

07:55.267 --> 07:59.104
Peter needed a way to pay it all off,
but he didn't have the money.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.690
He needed yours.
You're the one with the family money,

08:01.690 --> 08:03.275
but your accounts are separate.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.862
So he had Victor siphon funds
out of your account.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.409
Emily found out.

08:13.368 --> 08:17.331
<i>She contacted Marv
with a mutually beneficial plan.</i>

08:38.602 --> 08:40.062
- Emily.
- Shit!

08:41.438 --> 08:42.648
You scared me, asshole.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.150
This is a terrible fucking plan.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.320
We are gonna get caught.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.948
We won't. I checked. No security cameras.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.996
My car and the blood
make it look like there was a struggle.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.873
That way,
they can't dismiss me as a runaway.

09:01.667 --> 09:05.379
All right, so when I "find you," right,
there's a payout for me.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.965
Your stepdad gets a cut, right?

09:10.175 --> 09:11.260
What's in it for you?

09:12.761 --> 09:14.847
Fucking fame, dude.

09:14.847 --> 09:18.058
I never said that.
That drug dealer guy is lying.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.477
Obviously, he's just trying
to save himself.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.147
Yeah, I considered that. And then I--

09:24.147 --> 09:27.276
I looked at your Instagram feed
and I saw this--

09:27.276 --> 09:28.902
this bear in your bedroom,

09:28.902 --> 09:31.196
one that wasn't there
after you went missing.

09:31.196 --> 09:35.659
See, something bothered me
about her room, the way it was left.

09:35.659 --> 09:37.035
And then I realized what it was.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.497
There was nothing in that room
that was worn out or loved.

09:40.497 --> 09:44.793
No doll or blanket or bear.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.213
Emily, when kids go missing,

09:48.213 --> 09:50.966
they don't get the opportunity
to pack for the trip.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.594
You took it with you, didn't you?

09:53.594 --> 09:54.678
No.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.889
No, I donated that bear weeks ago.

09:59.808 --> 10:03.061
I went back to Marv's house,
and I found this...

10:05.272 --> 10:08.317
stashed between the mattress
and box spring.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.068
That's your donated bear.

10:15.616 --> 10:16.742
Emily...

10:17.451 --> 10:19.620
I just wanted people to know who I was.

10:20.120 --> 10:24.374
You know, Emily, this charade of yours,

10:24.374 --> 10:29.630
it took valuable police resources away
from people who are actually victims.

10:29.630 --> 10:30.714
You understand?

10:32.799 --> 10:36.178
Emily will take responsibility
for her actions.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.430
What about him?

10:41.141 --> 10:44.895
No, I only knew what was going on
after Marv approached me

10:44.895 --> 10:46.355
about getting the reward money up.

10:46.355 --> 10:48.815
Honey, I would never use Emily like this.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.234
You were stealing from me.

10:50.234 --> 10:53.153
And then, when you found out
that Emily wasn't actually missing,

10:53.153 --> 10:55.030
you didn't say a word.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.200
Peter.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.078
I know, I know.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.663
What can I do?

11:02.663 --> 11:04.831
I will go to rehab, okay? I promise. I--

11:04.831 --> 11:08.252
Rehab? No, no, no.
Peter, no, no, I don't think so.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.670
But where you are going,

11:09.670 --> 11:12.381
you're gonna have plenty of time
to get sober.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.446
- Frankie.
- Killebrew, it's been a while.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.157
Frankie. What's good, man?

11:39.157 --> 11:41.118
Yeah. Same old, same old.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.202
I hear that.

11:51.587 --> 11:54.173
Looks like you got more stuff
since the last time I was here.

11:54.173 --> 11:55.591
You gotta keep up with the times.

11:55.591 --> 11:59.052
Yeah, well, times are desperate,
and I need your skills.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.306
I need you to trace the feed
from a camera surveillance company.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.892
- I'm your guy.
- Good.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.439
Come on, it's a pupil-free day.
Let's go for a hike.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.278
Oh, man.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.531
I canceled a date last night
and fought through rush hour traffic

12:19.531 --> 12:22.284
to bring you Zachary's,
and your ass still didn't eat a slice.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.206
Hi, Vince.

12:27.206 --> 12:30.918
I'm here to check on Eva.
She hasn't returned any of my calls.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.670
You have no idea how hard
this has been on her,

12:33.670 --> 12:36.924
and I'm pretty sure she is not in the mood
for company right now.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.509
What are you, her guardian?

12:38.509 --> 12:39.760
Excuse me.

12:40.928 --> 12:41.929
Eva...

12:44.723 --> 12:45.766
What's going on?

12:47.434 --> 12:48.727
You tell me.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.146
Well...

12:55.526 --> 12:59.738
Aames and I found payments
implicating Finney on Questeur.

12:59.738 --> 13:02.783
We think he was paying Ochoa
for the hidden security cameras.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.410
We may be able to access the footage.

13:09.373 --> 13:10.374
Well, this--

13:11.250 --> 13:14.127
this could be the evidence needed
against the johns,

13:14.127 --> 13:16.296
and to take Finney down too.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.799
I thought my interview
was supposed to help bring down Finney.

13:20.217 --> 13:24.054
"Coming forward might help
launch an official investigation."

13:24.721 --> 13:25.973
That's what you told me.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.892
Well?
Your podcast should've been out by now.

13:28.892 --> 13:32.229
Hey, how about we take a beat?
I can warm up some pizza.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.730
Thank you.

13:36.942 --> 13:37.943
Eva...

13:38.485 --> 13:42.531
I told you after we got Sun,
we may not need your interview,

13:42.531 --> 13:44.074
and now we have this whole other--

13:44.074 --> 13:45.576
I need my interview.

13:45.576 --> 13:48.120
I need people to know
what Finney did to me.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.705
I bared my soul to you.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.790
Worst moments of my life.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.625
The least you could've done was air it.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.544
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.754
Okay.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.964
If your students--

13:58.964 --> 14:03.093
If their parents heard
that you were recruiting girls--

14:04.011 --> 14:06.680
Then what? If they heard, then what?

14:08.265 --> 14:09.558
What would they have thought of me?

14:10.809 --> 14:15.189
Eva, we have this new path to get Finney.

14:15.189 --> 14:18.025
One where you won't have
to sacrifice yourself.

14:18.025 --> 14:23.488
So I'm not airing your interview
because I'm trying to protect you.

14:23.488 --> 14:27.034
Oh, my God. Spare me
with the whole martyr bullshit.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.870
You know what I did. You know.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.914
I warned you
that I wasn't a perfect victim,

14:31.914 --> 14:34.249
so I don't understand.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.254
You enjoy this.

14:40.797 --> 14:41.840
What?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.676
You prey on people like me, like Warren.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.429
- What?
- You sent an innocent boy to prison,

14:47.429 --> 14:51.350
and then created a whole-ass show
about rescuing him.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.060
- That's so low.
- It's true.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.146
You pride yourself
on being this great truth-teller,

14:56.146 --> 14:57.523
but you refuse to be honest.

14:57.523 --> 14:59.566
- It's not true.
- It's true!

14:59.566 --> 15:01.527
- It's not true!
- It's true. It's true.

15:01.527 --> 15:05.781
Tell me what my students and my parents

15:05.781 --> 15:08.116
would think of me if they knew.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.910
- I don't know. I don't know!
- You can tell me.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.079
You can tell me because
it's the same fucking thing you think!

15:12.079 --> 15:14.498
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let us just take a step back

15:14.498 --> 15:16.333
and de-fucking-escalate.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.085
Please.

15:22.631 --> 15:27.094
I won't pretend to understand

15:27.094 --> 15:30.722
what this whole ordeal
is dredging up for you...

15:32.766 --> 15:36.728
but you do not have a monopoly on pain.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.992
Aubrey made you one
of these every time you rowed?

15:51.034 --> 15:52.536
That's some true love shit.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.289
Regattas always stressed me out,

15:55.289 --> 15:59.209
but he had a way of knowing
when I was all up in my head

15:59.209 --> 16:00.544
without me even telling him.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.171
That's what's up.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.679
Now he's so far away, though.

16:15.642 --> 16:19.021
Back in the Life, there were a couple
of times where I was, like--

16:19.021 --> 16:22.065
This dude's the one, like--
He's really feeling me,

16:22.065 --> 16:25.611
but he would get bored,

16:26.361 --> 16:29.323
or my pimp would just pass me off
to someone else.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.535
I figured most guys are just out
for themselves, you know...

16:35.621 --> 16:37.372
but totally not Aubrey.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.752
No. No, not Aubrey.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.173
Come in.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.302
- Everything okay, girls?
- All good, Ms. Killebrew.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.846
Can we go get some ice cream?

16:54.681 --> 16:55.891
Trini, honey, I don't know.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.143
Please, Mom?

16:59.978 --> 17:02.022
You wanted me to get back to normal.

17:04.525 --> 17:05.943
Take your phones. Keep them on.

17:05.943 --> 17:08.153
Of course. Thank you.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.655
- Love you.
- Love you.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.825
Hey.

17:14.910 --> 17:18.288
Did your contact come through,
or do you wish you brought me as muscle?

17:18.288 --> 17:20.374
Well, the files are populating now.

17:21.959 --> 17:22.960
Well...

17:22.960 --> 17:24.294
That's a lot of files.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.505
Yeah,
but this is not a whole security feed.

17:26.505 --> 17:28.173
These are individual videos.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.217
Look. This one is from 2019,

17:30.217 --> 17:34.179
so clearly, they've been hosting these
mixers at that house for a minute now.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.225
This file looks different from the others.

17:42.521 --> 17:43.605
What the--

17:43.605 --> 17:48.318
That looks like a young Finney
with an even younger girl.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.821
Is Finney being blackmailed too?

17:50.821 --> 17:51.738
Yeah, but by who?

17:52.614 --> 17:54.157
And to do what?

17:55.367 --> 17:57.661
- That's what I'm about to find out.
- Hold up, hold up.

17:57.661 --> 17:58.912
You wouldn't let me talk to him,

17:58.912 --> 18:01.039
but now you're just gonna
go waltz up in there?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.833
Well, now we have ammo.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.003
- Well, then I'm going with you.
- Nope.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.213
Now it's my turn to go alone.

18:08.714 --> 18:09.923
I'll see you later.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.308
Excuse me.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.437
I'm so sorry. I tried to stop her.

18:23.437 --> 18:25.022
No, it's okay, Alicia.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.232
Well, this is a surprise, Ms. Scoville.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.400
I'm sure it is.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.486
Please, sit.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.238
Thank you.

18:35.991 --> 18:38.243
- So what's on your mind?
- As you may know,

18:38.243 --> 18:41.371
I'm looking into the sex-trafficking ring
that was recently exposed.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.082
I was disappointed to hear
from my OPD contacts

18:44.082 --> 18:45.709
that a detective was involved.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.462
He certainly doesn't represent
all law enforcement.

18:48.462 --> 18:51.340
No, no. There are good cops.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.760
Detective Sun, however,
is not one of them.

18:54.760 --> 18:58.680
And I also discovered
he was reporting to someone.

19:03.560 --> 19:08.732
Well, this all sounds like great fodder
for one of your episodes,

19:08.732 --> 19:12.778
but if you'd like to hear my take
on the proliferation of crime in Oakland...

19:16.114 --> 19:17.574
you'll have to schedule an interview.

19:18.659 --> 19:19.826
I'm just swamped right now.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.085
Fine.

19:29.294 --> 19:33.799
I'll schedule something
with your campaign manager,

19:34.383 --> 19:39.096
although I'd love your initial take
on this ring.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.139
It's a scourge on the city.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.517
Indeed.

19:44.101 --> 19:45.561
And from what I've learned,

19:46.728 --> 19:50.899
traffickers prey on weaknesses, vulnerabilities.

19:50.899 --> 19:56.530
They use secrets from your past to get you
to do things you might not want to do.

19:58.782 --> 19:59.783
That's true.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.870
I've heard that as well.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.249
Please make sure Alicia gets you
on my schedule.

20:08.584 --> 20:09.751
It's good to see you again.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.430
I didn't think you ever wanted to see me.

20:21.430 --> 20:22.556
What?

20:23.807 --> 20:25.267
Aubrey, I love you.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.731
How are things in here?

20:30.731 --> 20:33.525
Believe it or not,
the Tater Tots are bomb.

20:39.656 --> 20:43.076
For real, though, how are you?

20:47.998 --> 20:49.124
I don't know.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.543
I've been thinking a lot.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.171
About what?

20:54.171 --> 20:55.422
About what happened.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.674
I just feel really bad.

21:03.597 --> 21:06.433
Did you know what was gonna happen
at the mansion?

21:07.226 --> 21:08.352
I knew about the mixer.

21:11.522 --> 21:12.689
Not everything,

21:12.689 --> 21:14.816
but I did know you were gonna go meet men.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.110
I guess I just thought

21:17.110 --> 21:19.905
if you didn't wanna do anything,
you could just say so.

21:20.656 --> 21:23.992
Like I said no to going to that party
in the first place?

21:24.785 --> 21:26.662
Or putting on that skanky-ass dress?

21:26.662 --> 21:28.622
I mean, how did that work out for me?

21:28.622 --> 21:30.749
- I'm so sorry about that, Trini.
- You said that you loved me.

21:30.749 --> 21:31.708
I do!

21:31.708 --> 21:33.669
Then how could you do this to me?

21:33.669 --> 21:35.087
I don't know. I just--

21:37.047 --> 21:38.465
I got caught up.

21:39.508 --> 21:45.055
You made me think
that I had to do that stuff for you.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.892
Trey had me thinking I needed
to make you do it for him.

21:51.645 --> 21:53.897
I'm so confused.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.232
It was fucked up.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.526
The whole thing was fucked up.

22:15.127 --> 22:15.961
You win.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.256
Fingers crossed.

22:19.256 --> 22:21.633
The election is still a few days away,
though. So...

22:21.633 --> 22:23.010
Fuck the election.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.596
I beg your pardon, I--

22:26.471 --> 22:29.099
Wait, don't I know you?

22:29.099 --> 22:30.309
You're--

22:31.351 --> 22:32.936
You're the principal at Oak Creek.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.397
Your school gave me such a warm welcome.

22:36.315 --> 22:38.025
It's not how I remember it.

22:39.067 --> 22:41.278
Do you need more supplies? More books?

22:41.278 --> 22:43.989
Just reach out to my office.
We'll get you whatever you need.

22:43.989 --> 22:46.783
The youth of Oakland
are my number one priority.

22:47.784 --> 22:48.869
Don't I know it.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.081
Thirty years ago, my name was Tamara...

22:54.917 --> 22:55.918
Ring any bells?

22:59.046 --> 23:00.422
That's back in the day...

23:04.009 --> 23:05.010
Did we party?

23:05.677 --> 23:07.012
We partied...

23:08.680 --> 23:10.140
You were in law school...

23:12.226 --> 23:13.602
I was in high school.

23:14.102 --> 23:17.272
We tore it up
at the Kennel Club that first night.

23:17.272 --> 23:20.317
I was so impressed
a white boy could dance like that.

23:20.901 --> 23:22.611
Never did make it back there, though.

23:22.611 --> 23:25.072
You were too busy taking me
to the Claremont or the Mark,

23:25.906 --> 23:30.077
introducing me to your classmates,
judges, lawyers, clerks.

23:32.454 --> 23:37.167
I was your girl, taking care of them
so they'd suck up to you.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.336
But I wasn't enough...

23:41.463 --> 23:46.844
You had me bring in Nadia, China,
and Tuesday.

23:48.846 --> 23:50.514
I bled for you.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.059
And you sold Lola up to Seattle,

23:54.059 --> 23:57.271
saying it would help my mother
get her green card.

23:58.772 --> 24:02.651
They deported her June 21st, 1994.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.445
She died the next May.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.574
I'm so sorry...

24:12.327 --> 24:13.787
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.129
You're scared I'm recording you...

24:26.341 --> 24:27.342
I'm not...

24:29.678 --> 24:31.763
but you recognize me now, don't you?

24:33.473 --> 24:34.975
You have me confused with someone else.

24:34.975 --> 24:39.188
You took everything from me.

24:40.189 --> 24:43.692
My mother, my pride, my worth.

24:46.028 --> 24:48.113
Sounds like someone really hurt you.

24:49.489 --> 24:50.657
Go to hell.

24:53.202 --> 24:54.745
Ms. Pierre,

24:54.745 --> 24:57.247
I'm sorry you're...

24:58.415 --> 25:00.125
filled with such anger...

25:02.085 --> 25:05.255
but maybe someday,
you'll be able to channel it...

25:15.182 --> 25:16.850
into something more productive.

25:35.285 --> 25:36.286
Hey.

25:40.624 --> 25:42.835
Melanie and I didn't go get ice cream.

25:44.211 --> 25:48.340
I just needed to talk to Aubrey,
so she took me to see him.

25:52.261 --> 25:54.763
I broke up with him.

25:55.472 --> 25:58.350
I'm sorry that I lied.

25:58.976 --> 26:02.062
Not just this time, but about the tape

26:02.062 --> 26:06.483
and getting in that stupid car
with Aubrey's fake cousins.

26:06.483 --> 26:08.110
All of it.

26:08.110 --> 26:10.487
You have all of my forgiveness.

26:14.283 --> 26:15.284
I just--

26:17.744 --> 26:21.665
I feel like I have no control

26:22.875 --> 26:27.546
over my body, my mind, anything.

26:28.046 --> 26:29.923
You've been through something

26:30.591 --> 26:33.802
so hard, so traumatic.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.264
But your Dad and I, we're here.

26:37.264 --> 26:38.348
We're here.

26:38.348 --> 26:40.684
Why is it so hard with him?

26:42.477 --> 26:45.147
I get that he's trying to help.

26:45.147 --> 26:47.399
But every time I see him, I just--

26:49.610 --> 26:50.903
I don't know, honey,

26:50.903 --> 26:53.530
maybe that's something
Chheng can help us figure out.

27:07.044 --> 27:08.045
Fuck.

27:52.923 --> 27:54.550
Finney seemed rattled.

27:55.217 --> 27:58.303
Damning sex tapes, bugged offices.

27:59.388 --> 28:01.431
He's not just being blackmailed.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.183
Maybe he has a boss.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.854
I'm gonna need higher ceilings.

28:08.856 --> 28:10.732
But then, who's at the top?

28:10.732 --> 28:13.527
My money would be on Ochoa.

28:13.527 --> 28:15.487
He has that security company, you know.

28:15.487 --> 28:18.740
He's definitely capable of tapping Finney.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.158
Yeah.

28:23.704 --> 28:24.705
Hey, it's Aames.

28:26.707 --> 28:28.208
Aames, you're not gonna believe this.

28:28.208 --> 28:31.795
<i>Finney's dead. He was run down
in a parking garage.</i>

28:31.795 --> 28:34.673
Looks personal too.
Driver hit him a couple of times.

28:34.673 --> 28:36.258
My God.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.219
Oh, my God.

28:41.388 --> 28:44.766
Long story... I spoke with him

28:44.766 --> 28:48.770
and it was clear he was afraid of someone.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.105
<i>So was Sun.</i>

28:50.606 --> 28:52.983
I thought Sun was afraid of Finney, but--

28:52.983 --> 28:55.068
Maybe they're afraid of the same person.

28:55.736 --> 28:59.156
Yeah, I gotta go. Just fill me in later.

29:01.450 --> 29:02.451
Yeah.

29:04.953 --> 29:05.954
Wow.

29:12.920 --> 29:16.840
Well, OPD doesn't have a Frankie,
but they'll find the videos.

29:21.094 --> 29:25.182
Even if they do,
this shit ain't gonna work out.

29:25.974 --> 29:30.312
You know why?
'Cause nothing fucking works out for me.

29:30.312 --> 29:31.647
No, no.

29:32.189 --> 29:35.359
Finney is dead, okay?

29:35.359 --> 29:37.653
Can't get answers from a corpse.

29:37.653 --> 29:38.987
Trey is shot.

29:39.738 --> 29:40.989
My little--

29:41.615 --> 29:44.201
My little girl, she got turned out
right under my own roof

29:44.201 --> 29:45.869
while I was doing what?

29:46.995 --> 29:49.998
Playing security guard after OPD shot me.

29:54.002 --> 29:57.005
Nah. My life is fuck up

29:57.005 --> 30:00.217
after fuck up after fuck up.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.473
Keep the faith.

30:08.433 --> 30:10.227
You've been down before.

30:11.436 --> 30:14.398
You fought your way through Santa Cruz

30:14.398 --> 30:17.025
and into policing a neighborhood
you loved.

30:18.277 --> 30:22.739
You started a one-man security firm
out of your garage

30:22.739 --> 30:27.828
that now employs 25 good,
hardworking people.

30:29.580 --> 30:32.040
You're anything but a fuck up, Markus.

30:35.169 --> 30:36.920
You have a huge heart...

30:38.714 --> 30:41.592
and a family that adores you.

30:45.179 --> 30:46.346
So do I.

31:02.487 --> 31:03.488
Markus.

31:05.699 --> 31:10.287
Look, everything bad started
when I fucked things up with you, Pop.

31:10.287 --> 31:12.206
Let's be real. You know that.

31:12.206 --> 31:16.043
I am going to chalk this lapse
in judgment up to you drinking again.

31:22.257 --> 31:25.010
I had my suspicions,
but I didn't wanna believe it.

31:27.179 --> 31:31.016
You're throwing away ten years
of sobriety.

31:31.934 --> 31:33.185
You're better than that.

31:35.270 --> 31:36.396
The hell I am.

31:39.775 --> 31:41.818
Please don't make me a home-wrecker.

31:43.237 --> 31:44.655
I'm not my mother.

32:12.558 --> 32:15.811
Surprise!

32:19.147 --> 32:22.442
What? It's not my birthday or Christmas.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.570
Happy New Year!

32:24.570 --> 32:26.572
Happy Halloween!

32:29.783 --> 32:32.661
You didn't get a single birthday
or holiday

32:32.661 --> 32:34.371
all those years you were in the Life.

32:34.371 --> 32:36.623
So, now we're making up for it.

32:37.666 --> 32:41.086
You people are like extra, extra.
But I love it.

32:42.129 --> 32:44.214
Well, the Scovilles do love a party now.

32:44.214 --> 32:47.301
Well, that's 'cause of Mama.
She put the X in excess.

32:48.385 --> 32:49.803
It's all right. We got you.

32:52.139 --> 32:53.432
What've we got? What've we got?

33:07.529 --> 33:08.530
Thank you.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.167
Man, your mother would have loved this.

33:25.547 --> 33:30.552
You ever wonder if Mama went
so overboard on parties

33:30.552 --> 33:32.638
because she felt guilty for leaving us?

33:35.599 --> 33:38.560
I think she wanted
to celebrate the people she loved.

33:42.731 --> 33:45.108
Come on. Talk to me, sweetheart.
Tell me how to make us right.

33:46.860 --> 33:47.861
I think--

33:52.366 --> 33:54.868
I think you know more
about Alexander than you're telling me.

33:54.868 --> 33:56.787
I told you all I know.

33:56.787 --> 34:00.958
I don't understand how one man could be
so beloved by the Parnells

34:00.958 --> 34:02.626
and so hated by Mom.

34:03.252 --> 34:06.046
Okay.

34:06.046 --> 34:07.548
Here we go.

34:07.548 --> 34:10.759
Happy birthday, Melanie!

34:13.136 --> 34:14.638
Happy birthday, Melanie.

34:18.433 --> 34:19.476
You got it.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.071
Okay. So, this song is--

34:31.071 --> 34:32.906
I guess it's an oldie now.

34:33.782 --> 34:36.201
It used to inspire me
when we were all teenagers,

34:36.201 --> 34:38.661
and I hope it does the same for you.

34:46.962 --> 34:50.924
<i>There's a hero</i>

34:50.924 --> 34:55.429
<i>If you look inside your heart</i>

34:55.429 --> 34:58.557
<i>You don't have to be afraid</i>

34:58.557 --> 35:02.477
<i>Of what you are</i>

35:02.978 --> 35:06.481
<i>There's an answer</i>

35:07.482 --> 35:11.403
<i>If you reach into your soul</i>

35:11.403 --> 35:14.740
<i>And the sorrow that you know</i>

35:14.740 --> 35:20.037
<i>Will melt away</i>

35:20.871 --> 35:25.125
<i>And then a hero comes along</i>

35:25.125 --> 35:29.463
<i>With the strength to carry on</i>

35:29.463 --> 35:33.425
<i>And you cast your fears aside</i>

35:33.425 --> 35:36.970
<i>And you know you can survive</i>

35:36.970 --> 35:41.391
<i>So when you feel like hope is gone</i>

35:41.391 --> 35:45.354
<i>Look inside you and be strong</i>

35:45.354 --> 35:49.274
<i>And you'll finally see the truth</i>

35:49.274 --> 35:55.364
<i>That a hero lies in you</i>

35:57.616 --> 36:00.077
<i>That a hero lies</i>

36:00.077 --> 36:06.166
<i>In you</i>

36:28.730 --> 36:32.776
<i>Can you ever fully know anyone?</i>

36:32.776 --> 36:35.237
It's an unanswerable question.

36:36.071 --> 36:37.906
The kind I hate to deal in.

36:38.991 --> 36:42.619
And yet it is a question
that's been plaguing me

36:44.121 --> 36:47.416
both personally and professionally.

36:48.083 --> 36:51.795
<i>So many people show only fragments
of themselves.</i>

36:51.795 --> 36:57.009
<i>The strongest, kindest,
the most accepting,</i>

36:58.010 --> 37:00.429
<i>the parts they want the world to see.</i>

37:01.680 --> 37:07.019
<i>But what happens when you dig deeper,
look closer?</i>

37:08.061 --> 37:13.442
<i>Sometimes the picture
that develops is better, richer.</i>

37:15.068 --> 37:19.740
<i>But sometimes it reveals ugly truths.</i>

37:36.298 --> 37:40.844
<i>Recognizing that someone
isn't who you thought they were is...</i>

37:42.095 --> 37:43.347
<i>never easy.</i>

37:43.931 --> 37:49.436
<i>Especially if their duplicity
hides behind a badge</i>

37:49.436 --> 37:51.271
<i>or a campaign promise.</i>

37:55.192 --> 38:00.364
<i>The ugly truth is that some
of the people we've entrusted</i>

38:00.364 --> 38:04.785
to protect and serve use their power

38:05.369 --> 38:08.413
to deceive and exploit.

38:09.414 --> 38:12.042
Still, they comprise only a fragment

38:12.042 --> 38:15.671
of what I fear will be an even larger,

38:16.213 --> 38:17.631
uglier picture.

38:23.929 --> 38:24.930
Daddy?

38:26.098 --> 38:28.851
Hey, sweetheart. You got a minute?

38:30.018 --> 38:32.229
- Yeah.
- Let's go see Uncle Bug.

38:35.232 --> 38:38.235
You two really wanna hear
about Ellie and Alexander?

38:43.282 --> 38:46.743
Leona is a lot of things,
but she isn't a liar.

38:47.786 --> 38:51.790
Alexander Michael Troy showed people
what he wanted them to see.

38:54.710 --> 38:55.919
But for Elinor,

38:57.462 --> 39:02.134
her prince turned out to be a controlling,
abusive son of a bitch.

39:02.134 --> 39:03.427
She could have told me.

39:03.427 --> 39:05.179
And risk losing you?

39:05.179 --> 39:09.433
Elinor understood
that you would kill any soul who hurt her.

39:10.642 --> 39:12.895
It took months until she accepted

39:12.895 --> 39:16.690
that what he was doing to her
wasn't all in her head, like he said.

39:18.984 --> 39:20.235
She left him.

39:21.195 --> 39:22.779
I only found out after the fact.

39:22.779 --> 39:27.326
And even then, she only told me.

39:27.326 --> 39:30.746
Shame plagues so many survivors.

39:32.664 --> 39:36.084
I mean, for months, our parents thought
she was still with Alexander.

39:36.084 --> 39:39.421
Now that ended the second she walked
through the door with you, Shreve.

39:40.923 --> 39:43.967
Oily jeans, leather coat.

39:44.801 --> 39:46.595
You didn't stand a chance.

39:48.347 --> 39:51.099
Especially when they found out
Elinor was pregnant.

39:51.725 --> 39:53.435
But Mama loved Daddy.

39:53.435 --> 39:55.604
Why would she go back
to a man that hurt her?

39:57.356 --> 40:00.317
To protect you and Desiree.

40:00.317 --> 40:04.071
Alexander showed up
outside the church playground

40:04.071 --> 40:06.323
and swore that he'd changed.

40:06.323 --> 40:07.533
She didn't believe him,

40:07.533 --> 40:10.577
but she knew
what his showing up there meant.

40:10.577 --> 40:12.120
That he could get to the girls.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.459
Bug, the food's up.

40:18.043 --> 40:21.338
Rudy's calling me over. Back soon.

40:29.721 --> 40:30.722
You okay?

40:32.516 --> 40:35.143
Is anyone who we think they are?

40:36.103 --> 40:39.565
Only God, Popsicle. Only God.

40:53.370 --> 40:56.081
Tomorrow we're gonna go to the park.
We're gonna go to the park...

40:56.081 --> 40:57.791
all day, I promise. Okay?

40:57.791 --> 41:00.419
That sounds like the good old days,
doesn't it?

41:00.419 --> 41:03.714
I'm sorry.
I thought I had the night off, all right.

41:03.714 --> 41:06.091
No, you obviously have
more important things.

41:06.091 --> 41:07.885
Look, it's better this way,

41:07.885 --> 41:11.305
because Justin wants
to spend some time with Max.

41:11.305 --> 41:13.265
Doesn't he? Bye, Billy.

41:13.265 --> 41:15.684
- Come on.
- Bye-bye.

41:16.476 --> 41:17.519
Bye, Maxie.

41:18.937 --> 41:19.938
Yeah.

41:51.470 --> 41:52.721
<i>Andrew Finney is dead.</i>

41:55.015 --> 41:57.392
He was run over.

42:00.771 --> 42:04.525
And I just wanted you to hear it from me.

42:08.820 --> 42:11.156
I know it's a lot to process.

42:13.534 --> 42:15.160
He got what he deserved.

42:20.249 --> 42:21.667
I'll be okay.

42:22.251 --> 42:23.252
Really?

42:24.378 --> 42:25.420
Yeah.

42:25.420 --> 42:27.339
I had some tough conversations with myself

42:27.339 --> 42:30.968
and realized that holding on to the past,

42:31.760 --> 42:33.303
it just hurts me,

42:33.303 --> 42:36.557
and it hurts those around me.

42:38.433 --> 42:39.518
I'm sorry about earlier.

42:40.727 --> 42:46.066
I lashed out, hoping you'd clap back
and give me what I deserve.

42:47.401 --> 42:48.402
Thank you.

42:49.570 --> 42:53.657
And I owe you an apology too.

42:53.657 --> 42:56.201
I should've told you about the podcast.

42:59.162 --> 43:02.124
And, yes,

43:03.417 --> 43:04.793
I judged you.

43:09.047 --> 43:10.507
Thank you for your honesty.

43:11.884 --> 43:12.885
Of course.

43:14.011 --> 43:15.721
And when you're ready,

43:15.721 --> 43:19.099
I'll need your help again.

43:19.933 --> 43:22.519
Finney wasn't the head
of the trafficking ring.

43:23.312 --> 43:26.190
We think he was being blackmailed

43:26.190 --> 43:31.236
into bringing girls
and johns into the operation.

43:32.237 --> 43:35.199
So, we just have to figure out
who was blackmailing him

43:35.199 --> 43:38.452
and stop them from trafficking more girls.

43:40.871 --> 43:42.164
And find his killer.

43:48.128 --> 43:49.338
Do you want some tea?

43:49.338 --> 43:52.966
I've got chamomile, mint, ginger.

43:52.966 --> 43:55.260
Yes. Thank you.
