WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.263
- <i>Previously on "The Ark"...</i>
- As of this moment,

00:02.263 --> 00:04.439
you are no longer
an officer on this ship.

00:04.439 --> 00:07.137
After what they did to me,
my only remaining loyalty
lies with you.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.487
- I have Klampkins disease.
- There'’s no cure.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.315
Brice!

00:11.315 --> 00:13.100
I knew someone
who had Klampkins.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.927
You gave him a death sentence.
It was just sex.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.886
Oh, yeah, just sex.

00:16.886 --> 00:20.672
The archives from Ark 3 might
have the cure for Klampkins.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.718
I don'’t want to die,
but I'’m going to.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.763
Our ark and Ark 3
were hit by the same substance.

00:24.763 --> 00:27.505
The chemical came from a weapon
mounted on Ark 15.

00:27.505 --> 00:31.553
How'’s the Juno Project going?

00:31.553 --> 00:33.685
Can we forget about work
just for a little while?

00:38.821 --> 00:42.346
So as you can see,
despite yesterday'’s incident,

00:42.346 --> 00:44.348
the FTL'’s negative
energy feedback

00:44.348 --> 00:46.524
regenerated enough fuel
for us to activate it again.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.613
- We get lucky.
- Extremely.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.181
And once we'’re underway,
we'’ll be in Proxima B
in no time.

00:51.181 --> 00:54.315
All right, all right.
Not so fast.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.491
First we need Eva
to give the drive a once-over.

00:56.491 --> 00:59.189
You want to check my work?

00:59.189 --> 01:02.410
I wanna throw you back
in your cryo pod, mate,

01:02.410 --> 01:04.629
- but apparently
that'’s elder abuse.
- I think it won'’t hurt

01:04.629 --> 01:06.892
having another pair of eyes
look things over.

01:06.892 --> 01:11.201
If that'’s the way
you want to use your crew'’s
valuable time, so be it.

01:11.201 --> 01:15.684
Stop, stop!
Don'’t start the drive.
I know where Ark 15 is.

01:20.297 --> 01:23.866
I studied its trajectory
as it dropped out of
light speed to attack Ark 3.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.436
That'’s Ark 15,
and that'’s Ark 3.

01:30.220 --> 01:33.049
And that'’s Ark 1
when we were attacked.

01:33.049 --> 01:36.748
- Brilliant, Miss Nevins.
- Oh, thank you.

01:36.748 --> 01:39.316
Could you explain it
for the non-navigation
wonks among us?

01:39.316 --> 01:40.317
Oh, right.

01:40.317 --> 01:43.015
Um, Ark 15 attacked us,

01:43.015 --> 01:44.713
and then it attacked Ark 3.

01:44.713 --> 01:47.237
Three points in a row
make a straight line

01:47.237 --> 01:49.413
or a course heading.
If you follow it through,

01:49.413 --> 01:51.023
- then--
- It goes straight to Proxima B.

01:51.023 --> 01:54.288
Yes. That'’s where Ark 15 went.

01:54.288 --> 01:57.639
So, if we go to Prox B,

01:57.639 --> 01:59.031
we'’re running
straight towards the ship

01:59.031 --> 01:59.989
that tried to kill us.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.884
Ark 15 already
tried to kill us once.

02:25.884 --> 02:28.887
- And they did kill Ark 3.
- And we still have no idea why?

02:28.887 --> 02:32.239
No, and it'’s unlikely
we'’ll be as lucky a second time.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.936
Not as long as they have
the Aliciaminium weapon.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.896
I'’ve given up trying
to fight it.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.637
I can'’t believe
I'’m saying this.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.639
We might have
to change course.

02:41.639 --> 02:44.120
The next inhabitable
planet is Ross 128B.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.732
We can'’t do that.
It'’ll add years to our journey.

02:47.732 --> 02:50.909
- This ship is in bad shape.
- I don'’t like it either,
but it'’s the safest--

02:50.909 --> 02:53.477
It'’s unacceptable.
We cannot allow it.

02:53.477 --> 02:57.916
Mr. and Mrs. Trust, you are
in this meeting as a courtesy.
You don'’t get a vote.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.354
A vote?
So let me get this straight.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.269
You have such little faith
in your leadership

03:02.269 --> 03:03.531
that you put things
up for a vote?

03:03.531 --> 03:05.489
It'’s called democracy, dipshit.

03:05.489 --> 03:08.275
Show them your plan, honey.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.667
Then we can end this nonsense.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.978
What is this?

03:15.978 --> 03:18.023
It looks like a design
for a shield.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.852
It uses the FTL'’s
space distortion bubble.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.376
According to this,
it would maintain the bubble

03:22.376 --> 03:25.161
upon arrival at the destination
to act as a shield.

03:25.161 --> 03:28.773
- It could work.
- Could? We don'’t know?

03:28.773 --> 03:32.473
We can'’t risk everyone's lives
on an idea that might work.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.388
I would risk my life on this.

03:34.388 --> 03:35.737
Kinda like how
you risked the lives

03:35.737 --> 03:37.304
of the entire
North Euro District

03:37.304 --> 03:38.957
when you tried
decarbonization?

03:38.957 --> 03:43.745
I did not mean to kill
or hurt anyone!

03:43.745 --> 03:45.616
William was trying
to save Earth.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.618
No one could have
foreseen Klampkins.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.969
Let'’s cut to the chase,
shall we?

03:50.969 --> 03:53.189
If it'’s a choice
between Garnet and him,

03:53.189 --> 03:55.539
I choose Garnet every time.

03:55.539 --> 03:58.150
I don'’t like the idea
of adding years to the trip,

03:58.150 --> 04:00.457
but I have faith in
Lieutenant Garnet'’s judgment.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.154
Oh, I see.

04:02.154 --> 04:05.070
It'’s not a democracy,
it'’s a popularity contest.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.290
Agreed.
You'’re acting like children.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.032
So we'’ll have to treat you
like children.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.610
- What is this?
- I'’ve locked the FTL drive.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.613
- You--
- This is no longer a debate.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.616
When you'’re ready
to go to Proxima B,
I'’ll unlock the drive.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.487
Permission to go and beat
the shit out of him?

04:30.487 --> 04:32.750
- Brice.
- We still have time until

04:32.750 --> 04:35.362
- the FTL completes charging.
- Time to do what exactly?

04:35.362 --> 04:36.885
Just give in to his demands?

04:36.885 --> 04:39.191
Maybe we should
consider his plan.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.411
We did. And rejected it.

04:48.592 --> 04:52.422
Alicia, I need you
to do something for me.

04:59.037 --> 05:02.824
Most people just
throw seeds in dirt,
then douse them with water.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.739
It'’s how I thought it was done.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.828
Well, different crops get
planted at different depths

05:06.828 --> 05:09.483
and require different
amounts of hydration.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.007
Drink up, my new friends.

05:12.007 --> 05:15.402
Believe it or not, plants
respond when we talk to them.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.273
That'’s kind of
a beautiful thing.

05:19.144 --> 05:22.365
I always thought so.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.715
So, will any of this
work on Prox B?

05:24.715 --> 05:26.587
Uh, it'’ll have different soil,

05:26.587 --> 05:29.459
which means
different vegetation.

05:29.459 --> 05:33.637
- But will it
be safe for humans?
- Maybe. Maybe not.

05:33.637 --> 05:36.379
That'’s why we need someone
who knows what they'’re doing,

05:36.379 --> 05:39.077
so we can make Prox B
support crops we can eat.

05:39.077 --> 05:43.734
So what you'’re saying is
if we have any hope
of surviving--

05:43.734 --> 05:45.997
More people need to learn
the intricate science
of agriculture.

05:45.997 --> 05:51.089
I was going to say
then you'’re the most
important man on this ship.

06:06.670 --> 06:10.935
So I figured if we can
see each other naked,

06:10.935 --> 06:15.462
then we can probably
have lunch together.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.420
I thought you were mad at me.

06:17.420 --> 06:21.555
I was, but this is me trying
to be the bigger person.

06:21.555 --> 06:25.559
This is you trying to get me
back to your bunk.

06:25.559 --> 06:26.603
Can'’t both be true?

06:31.347 --> 06:36.918
Look, I am sorry
that I stormed out.

06:36.918 --> 06:41.401
I just-- I really can'’t do
false hope again, okay?

06:43.098 --> 06:46.144
- Okay.
- And besides, you know,

06:46.144 --> 06:48.538
the last time that we, um...

06:48.538 --> 06:51.715
...enjoyed each other'’s company,

06:51.715 --> 06:53.935
- that was the last time, right?
- The very last time.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.938
Right, so now
we can just go back
to being friends,

06:56.938 --> 06:58.418
and friends eat lunch together.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.161
- Were we friends?
- Well, all right.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.206
Colleagues then.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.428
Wait, we'’re not friends?

07:08.428 --> 07:11.256
We didn'’t know each
other before launch.

07:11.256 --> 07:12.867
We barely
know each other now.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.743
I know a few things about you,
Eva Markovic.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.529
You'’re not as funny
as you think you are.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.792
I would really
like to be friends.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.405
I'’d like that, too.

07:37.587 --> 07:40.590
I assume I'’m here
because you realize the error
you almost made.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.419
- Come see for yourself.
- Everyone makes mistakes.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.769
What'’s important
is admitting when you'’re--

07:45.769 --> 07:48.076
This is a course for Ross 128B.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.428
I'’ve considered your opinion,

07:52.428 --> 07:56.519
and I won'’t risk our lives
on an untested shield theory.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.739
So you take refuge on my ark,

07:58.739 --> 08:01.132
but now you don'’t believe that
I can keep us safe at Proxima B?

08:01.132 --> 08:05.354
It'’s not your ark.
It'’s our ark.

08:05.354 --> 08:09.445
- Unlock the drive. Now.
- Or what?

08:09.445 --> 08:11.621
You'’ll get your Scottish thug
torture the codes out of me?

08:11.621 --> 08:14.537
As much as he'’d love that,
and he really would,

08:14.537 --> 08:17.366
- that'’s not how
we do things on this ship.
- So why call me here?

08:17.366 --> 08:20.195
To see if you could play ball
with the rest of us.

08:20.195 --> 08:23.154
Now I know you can'’t.
Alicia?

08:28.159 --> 08:30.031
Really?

08:30.031 --> 08:31.946
You'’re bringing a child
into this argument?

08:31.946 --> 08:33.861
- That'’s not--
- I used your backdoor code

08:33.861 --> 08:35.776
for Ark 3 as a starting point.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.995
It seemed like you were partial
to modified octal codes.

08:42.434 --> 08:43.784
And I'’m not a child.

08:47.701 --> 08:51.879
Thank you for your
assistance with
the Maddox retrofit.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.534
Your services are no longer
needed on the bridge.

09:03.978 --> 09:06.284
She used a child
to humiliate me.

09:06.284 --> 09:07.677
I don'’t agree
with how she did it,

09:07.677 --> 09:09.200
but I know she wasn'’t
trying to humiliate you.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.899
You know?

09:11.899 --> 09:14.031
Garnet does what she thinks
is best for the crew,

09:14.031 --> 09:16.860
- even when she'’s wrong.
- Bloody well right,
she'’s wrong.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.688
How many more people
will die on this ship

09:18.688 --> 09:20.864
if we spend at least
another two years here?

09:20.864 --> 09:22.562
That'’s blood on her hands.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.346
That'’s blood on all our hands.

09:24.346 --> 09:28.089
If we have the power
to stop her and we don'’t do it,

09:28.089 --> 09:29.569
doesn'’t that make us complicit?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.440
What are you saying?

09:33.485 --> 09:36.097
You'’re a good person, Will.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.099
You tried do it nice way.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.929
Now it'’s time to do it
the painful way.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.550
This is the right move.

10:00.425 --> 10:03.341
Attention all hands,
this is Garnet.

10:03.341 --> 10:07.476
<i>We have evidence to suggest
Ark 15 is at Proxima B.</i>

10:07.476 --> 10:10.435
<i>They tried to destroy us once.</i>

10:10.435 --> 10:12.307
<i>There'’s no reason to think
they won'’t try again.</i>

10:12.307 --> 10:16.006
<i>We have no reliable defense
against their weapon.</i>

10:16.006 --> 10:17.704
<i>This forces
Lieutenant Brice and me</i>

10:17.704 --> 10:19.227
<i>to make a difficult decision.</i>

10:19.227 --> 10:23.405
We are altering course
for Ross 128B.

10:23.405 --> 10:27.583
<i>Unfortunately, this will
add years to our journey.</i>

10:27.583 --> 10:30.717
<i>The risk of continuing
to Proxima is too dangerous,</i>

10:30.717 --> 10:33.720
<i>which makes
the decision simple.</i>

10:33.720 --> 10:36.897
<i>We are better safe than dead.</i>

10:36.897 --> 10:38.420
<i>Brace for jump to FTL.</i>

10:43.860 --> 10:46.646
Hey, I trust your instincts.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.741
Eva, activate FTL.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.961
- Is there problem?
- No, Lieutenant.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.250
Hey.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.647
Hey.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.872
It'’s just real now, you know?

11:40.525 --> 11:45.008
We'’re going to Ross 128,
and I'’m never make it.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.663
Why didn'’t you try
to talk Garnet out of it?

11:47.663 --> 11:51.841
No, come on.
Eva, she'’s right.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.278
And I'’m not willing
to sacrifice the crew
for my own selfish reasons.

12:00.545 --> 12:04.245
In my professional opinion,
Garnet has lost her mind.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.247
We'’ve been at light speed
for over a week,

12:06.247 --> 12:09.076
and she'’s just pretending
it'’s business as usual.

12:09.076 --> 12:12.557
- Garnet doesn'’t care that
no one wants to go to Ross.
- Aren'’t we past that?

12:12.557 --> 12:16.126
I mean, it was too dangerous
to go to Prox B.

12:16.126 --> 12:19.173
There'’s danger at every planet.

12:19.173 --> 12:22.263
At least at Prox B
we would'’ve had a shield
to protect us from Ark 15.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.786
Wait. We have a shield?

12:24.961 --> 12:26.267
We would'’ve.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.051
Designed by
William Trust himself.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.706
What will Garnet do
when we get to Ross 128

12:30.706 --> 12:31.707
and there'’s more trouble?

12:31.707 --> 12:33.230
We'’ll just change course again?

12:33.230 --> 12:35.885
The way she'’s acting?
I wouldn'’t put it past her.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.626
We may never get off this ship.

12:41.325 --> 12:44.720
- I can'’t believe this.
- What are we gonna do?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.287
Someone needs
to stand up to her.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.202
How long will we survive
on this deathtrap?

12:51.988 --> 12:54.730
- Damn it!
- Everything okay?

12:54.730 --> 12:57.864
It'’s my WD.
I can'’t get it to work.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.517
Oh, you can
just get another one.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.869
This one'’s from Ark 3.
The tech'’s more advanced.

13:02.869 --> 13:06.263
- Oh.
- Clearer audio, stronger
signal, subspace able.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.007
And it'’s the last thing
I have from there.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.923
I'’m sorry.
I didn'’t even think about that.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.796
Hey, maybe you could fix it?
You'’re so smart.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.320
Oh, well, sorry.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.758
I know how to use
one of those, not fix one.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.369
But I bet one of
the engineers could fix it.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.906
Double-checking my work?

13:39.906 --> 13:42.169
Can I help you?
I have work to do.

13:42.169 --> 13:45.781
Lane'’s been updating me
on all the challenges

13:45.781 --> 13:49.132
that you'’ve faced
since waking up.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.831
I'’m amazed at how you've
held this ark together.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.484
You'’re the best engineer
on the ship.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.705
I'’m the only one left.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.663
But now you'’re the best
engineer on the ship.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.928
My dear, I'’m the best
engineer in the galaxy.

14:07.759 --> 14:08.978
I know why you'’re here.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.809
We'’re going to Ross,
and you need to accept it.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.158
Do you accept it?

14:18.379 --> 14:20.903
For a junior level engineer,

14:20.903 --> 14:24.254
you'’ve performed miracles
by holding this ship together.

14:24.254 --> 14:29.607
But tell me, how many more
do you think you have in you?

14:29.607 --> 14:32.393
- We'’re a team. We all--
- You'’re smarter than that.

14:32.393 --> 14:35.439
This is your ship. Think.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.615
Do you honestly believe it
will last years at light speed?

14:51.499 --> 14:53.283
Please eat, dear.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.853
I'’m sorry,
it'’s just I never thought

14:57.853 --> 15:00.029
I'’d have the chance
to meet you and Mr. Trust,

15:00.029 --> 15:03.032
- let alone eat lunch with you.
- No need to apologize.

15:03.032 --> 15:06.253
I'’m flattered that you hold us
in such high esteem.

15:08.211 --> 15:11.649
- Not everyone does, you know.
- Why not?

15:11.649 --> 15:14.435
Mr. Trust is a brilliant man
trying to save the human race.

15:14.435 --> 15:17.220
Some people
still blame poor William
for Klampkins syndrome.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.353
He was trying to save Earth.

15:19.353 --> 15:22.530
If the decarbonization
had worked, they'’d have
called him a hero.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.706
Truer words.

15:30.190 --> 15:34.585
Can I ask you a question?
How is Felix?

15:38.415 --> 15:40.156
He...

15:40.156 --> 15:42.289
He asked me not to talk
about him with you.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.207
I'’m just worried about him.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.079
I knew his family.

15:52.255 --> 15:55.519
Robert and Katheryn
were such beautiful souls.

15:57.695 --> 16:02.265
- He'’s having a hard time.
- I thought so.

16:02.265 --> 16:03.353
It explains a lot.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.097
Felix is making
emotional decisions.

16:10.056 --> 16:13.494
And emotional decisions
are dangerous.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.538
Wouldn'’t you agree?

16:23.678 --> 16:26.681
Kabir has put in
a fourth request
for another set of hands.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.291
We have to reassign someone
before Dr. Kabir has--

16:28.291 --> 16:30.293
Lieutenants, rumor is Trust

16:30.293 --> 16:31.599
came up with a shield
against Ark 15.

16:31.599 --> 16:35.124
- Is this true?
- He had a theory.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.213
- There'’s no way to test it.
- But it could work?

16:37.213 --> 16:40.086
We don'’t know.
The only way to find out
is to risk all our lives.

16:40.086 --> 16:43.654
So you just gave up
and added years to
the mission? That'’s crap!

16:43.654 --> 16:46.048
Oi! You watch your tone.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.530
I understand. You'’re pissed.
Hell, I'’m pissed, too.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.923
A lot of people are wondering
if you added years to the trip

16:51.923 --> 16:54.709
because you'’ll have
to give up command
when we'’re on the planet.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.842
I think it'’s time you
go back to your station, ensign.

16:57.842 --> 17:01.846
- Most of the crew
don'’t want this.
- Too bad.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.544
My job isn'’t to give you
what you want.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.024
My job is to give you
what you need.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.244
Then maybe
you should lose your job.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.475
Security,
report to corridor 31B.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.868
We have a couple of gentlemen
cooling off waiting for you.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.132
If we don'’t get the crew
on our side,

17:26.132 --> 17:27.437
we'’re not gonna last
another two years.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.748
There'’s no sign
of a concussion.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.271
You'’re very lucky.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.796
That'’s me,
luckiest woman on Ark 1.

17:38.796 --> 17:41.582
Well, I mean,
Cat'’s rich and famous,

17:41.582 --> 17:43.801
and wasn'’t experimented on
as a child,

17:43.801 --> 17:45.412
but you'’re a close second.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.372
Sorry, but we ran out
of wound glue,

17:49.372 --> 17:51.200
so I'’ll have to sew you up
the old fashioned way.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.636
But don'’t worry, I numbed it.

17:59.382 --> 18:02.820
- Um, maybe I should do this.
- Just give me a moment.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.606
- I can--
- It'’s fine, okay?

18:05.606 --> 18:06.607
You'’re going through a lot.

18:08.957 --> 18:09.914
Thank you.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.362
How'’s recovery going?

18:22.362 --> 18:25.060
As you can see,
not fast enough.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.758
Whatever you need,
I'’m here for you.

18:27.758 --> 18:31.980
- I appreciate that.
Cat'’s been helping.
- Hmm.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.416
She'’s holding
onto the key to the meds.

18:33.416 --> 18:36.245
It helps with the temptation.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.644
But I still have
a long way to go.

18:46.995 --> 18:50.041
Hey. I heard about Garnet.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.565
I just wanted to check in.

18:51.565 --> 18:54.829
- So now you care?
- That'’s not what I meant.

18:54.829 --> 18:58.267
I was hoping the attack
might'’ve made you
reconsider Proxima B.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.096
- Mr. Trust still thinks--
- I don'’t give two shits
what that man thinks.

19:01.096 --> 19:04.882
- Yeah, but the crew--
- Don'’t get a vote,
just like Trust.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.581
Is this about
your belief in Garnet
or your hatred for Trust?

19:07.581 --> 19:12.281
- Both.
- You do know he'’s the reason
you'’re alive, right?

19:12.281 --> 19:14.283
You'’d be dead back on Earth
if it wasn'’t for Mr. Trust.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.111
You should be thanking him
for saving your life.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.722
Yeah, well, I'’ll tell that
to all the people
dying of Klampkins.

19:18.722 --> 19:21.595
That was an accident.
It doesn'’t discount
all the good he'’s done.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.684
Oh, yes, it does.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.686
And to be perfectly honest, mate,

19:25.686 --> 19:27.514
I really don'’t understand
your blind faith in him.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.953
I owe everything to Trust.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.476
I couldn'’t have
afforded the academy

19:33.476 --> 19:36.131
without a Trust Industries scholarship.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.741
He'’s the reason
I'’m in the GSA.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.051
Yeah, well,
he'’s also the reason
you'’re now a civilian.

19:53.192 --> 19:58.327
- Helena Trust asked
about you again.
- I'’m sure she did.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.024
Thank you for continuing
to look after them.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.157
She says you'’re making
emotional decisions.

20:03.941 --> 20:07.162
Yes, I'’m well known
for my histrionics.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.819
I know your relationship'’s
complicated,

20:11.819 --> 20:14.213
but as a council member,
you need to see past that.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.520
You'’re referring
to the decision
to go to Ross 128B?

20:17.520 --> 20:19.740
Mr. Trust had a plan
for Ark 15.

20:19.740 --> 20:23.222
The decision was made
and we'’re underway.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.746
Now we need to present
a united front.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.661
The first couple of weeks
will be tough, and...

20:31.186 --> 20:35.016
- Is it hot in here?
- Have more water.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.023
It'’s so hot.

20:43.894 --> 20:45.244
Where did everyone...

20:46.810 --> 20:48.203
What?

20:50.379 --> 20:53.164
- Jelena.
- I'’m really sorry, boss,

20:53.164 --> 20:54.905
but you'’re making
emotional decisions.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.385
You would'’ve gotten
in his way

20:56.385 --> 20:59.258
and maybe even
gotten hurt yourself.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.477
This way is better.

21:06.656 --> 21:10.399
Well, if that was
the actual last time

21:10.399 --> 21:13.272
then at least we, you know...

21:13.272 --> 21:17.232
...topped ourselves.

21:17.232 --> 21:21.584
Okay, that really was
the last time we do this.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.238
Right, I'’m just-- thank you.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.588
I'’m just saying, you know,

21:25.588 --> 21:28.243
if you were to ever
change your mind,

21:28.243 --> 21:32.073
then you know exactly
where to find me.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.426
After today,
you'’ll never want
to speak to me again.

21:39.733 --> 21:44.694
- Why wouldn'’t I talk to you?
- Because Trust is right.

21:44.694 --> 21:48.655
Ark 1 will never make it
to Ross 128.

21:48.655 --> 21:51.701
- You'’ll never make it.
- Eva, what the hell
are you talking about?

21:51.701 --> 21:54.704
Trust is a monster. He'’s--

21:56.663 --> 21:57.881
Eva?

22:00.101 --> 22:01.624
Eva, what the hell did you do?

22:01.624 --> 22:03.887
- You'’re just going to sleep.
- What did you do?

22:06.673 --> 22:08.675
It was the only way
to protect you.

22:15.551 --> 22:19.250
How'’s the head?

22:19.250 --> 22:23.080
It hurts.
On a lot of levels.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.343
You feel like the crew
doesn'’t have your back?

22:26.736 --> 22:29.478
I know I made
the right decision,

22:29.478 --> 22:32.699
but I also know a lot people
hate me now, so...

22:34.657 --> 22:36.137
May I offer a different view?

22:38.095 --> 22:41.142
Maybe this is so tough
because you'’re wrong.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.190
No, um, the safety
of the crew is...

22:49.455 --> 22:52.153
I don'’t feel, um--

22:52.153 --> 22:54.503
I need to go see Dr. Kabir.
I might have a concussion.

22:54.503 --> 22:56.244
Oh, no, no, no.
Sit down, sit down.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.289
I have some water.
I'’ll call Kabir.

22:58.289 --> 23:01.380
No, I should walk

23:01.380 --> 23:04.948
so I don'’t pass out.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.609
You didn'’t use enough.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.437
You should'’ve taken
into account my enhancements.

23:23.706 --> 23:24.751
I did anticipate them.

23:35.936 --> 23:36.980
I'’m really sorry.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.857
Um, I don'’t think that
they'’re supposed to be here.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.554
Take your station, Alicia.

23:49.036 --> 23:49.906
Do it.

23:55.956 --> 23:57.392
Initiating FTL recharge.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.658
Attention, Ark 1,

24:02.658 --> 24:04.399
this is Lieutenant Lane
to all hands.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.577
Due to an unfortunate
lack in judgment,

24:08.577 --> 24:12.581
Lieutenant Brice, Garnet,
and Strickland have all
been relieved of duty.

24:12.581 --> 24:15.018
- What? You can'’t--
- Shh, shh, shh,
Don'’t worry, Alicia.

24:15.018 --> 24:19.196
- Everything'’s gonna be fine.
- It is my reluctant obligation
to take command of Ark 1,

24:19.196 --> 24:22.548
and my first order is that we
resume our mission to Proxima B.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.898
Now, thanks to
Mr. Trust'’s genius,

24:24.898 --> 24:28.162
we have a plan
to shield ourselves.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.773
Once the FTL is charged,
we'’ll be underway.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.995
Lane out.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.432
If anyone has a problem,
you can be reassigned.

24:37.432 --> 24:40.043
Otherwise,
back to your stations.

24:40.043 --> 24:43.482
You made the right choice,
Lieutenant Lane.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.526
Thank you, Mr. Stein.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.139
I believe that
that chair is yours.

24:49.139 --> 24:52.447
No, I'’m just a lieutenant.

24:52.447 --> 24:55.450
- You are the captain.
- Except I'’m not.

24:55.450 --> 24:58.061
I'’m just doing
what has to be done
to keep this crew safe.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.630
Men and their pride.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.464
- It'’s just a chair.
- No one'’s sat in that chair
since Captain Lester died.

25:09.464 --> 25:12.467
Then no one will mind
if I take it.

25:19.822 --> 25:23.478
Oh. Oh, man, I feel like
I went on a bender.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.265
The headache wears off
in a minute.

25:28.265 --> 25:31.094
But the rage and sense
of betrayal will stay.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.487
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

25:32.487 --> 25:35.490
I was with--
I was with Eva and then...

25:37.448 --> 25:39.538
- Trust.
- And Lane.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.323
- He'’s taken command.
- Soon we'’ll change
course to Prox B.

25:47.633 --> 25:51.201
- Shit! No!
- Easy, Brice!

25:51.201 --> 25:53.552
We'’re all angry, but we've
gotta stay level-headed.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.684
Now everyone'’s
gonna die on this ship.
It'’s not just me.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.643
- It won'’t just be me.
- You'’re not making any sense.

25:57.643 --> 25:58.687
The sedatives are probably
still in your system.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.036
I'’ve got Klampkins!

26:02.430 --> 26:04.911
I'’m going to die
because of him.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.262
And now everyone else is, too.

26:15.095 --> 26:18.533
- I'’m so sorry about--
- It'’s okay. It's okay.

26:22.319 --> 26:26.541
- It'’s okay.
- That man has hurt us all.

26:32.329 --> 26:35.419
Tell you what,
when we get out of this,

26:35.419 --> 26:38.553
you get to be the one
to lay Trust out on his ass.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.210
Well, you just gave me
a reason to live.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.700
Amazing.
How did you get all this?

26:54.700 --> 26:56.745
You know me.
I make friends everywhere.

26:56.745 --> 27:00.749
This is like old times,
but with less champagne.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.926
I really wanted to thank you
for all your help.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.102
When William
assigned you Garnet,
I was worried.

27:06.102 --> 27:09.410
Oh, Sharon would never hurt me.
It'’s not in her nature.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.545
You know they'’re
good people, right?
Just misguided.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.765
Hmm. Of course.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.944
Once we'’re safe on Proxima,
they'’ll understand.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.425
They'’ll thank us for taking them
to the promised land.

27:25.556 --> 27:26.819
Time for a session.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.911
- A session?
- A work session

27:31.911 --> 27:34.478
to catch up on the status
of the Juno Project.

27:34.478 --> 27:37.177
- Now?
- Yes, when we arrive,

27:37.177 --> 27:40.006
I have no doubt that the crew
will start celebrating.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.964
With the loss of half the crew,
it'’s been a challenge

27:41.964 --> 27:43.618
to find everyone'’s
perfect genetic mate.

27:46.403 --> 27:52.192
All this hard work and secrecy
for glorified matchmaking?

27:52.192 --> 27:54.368
We have
a very limited gene pool.

27:54.368 --> 27:58.633
We can'’t just have
people pairing up
with whoever they want.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.027
It'’s the only way
to maintain genetic diversity.

28:01.027 --> 28:03.420
You know, to avoid
unnecessary birth defects.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.596
- Stuff like that.
- Exactly.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.555
Hey, Cat, who'’s your match?

28:07.555 --> 28:13.343
- I can'’t wait to meet him.
- He died with the command crew.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.737
- I have to find someone new.
- Aww.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.788
You do that.
You find someone new.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.026
Hey, I wanted to talk
to you earlier,

28:44.026 --> 28:45.288
but you seemed really busy.

28:47.464 --> 28:50.641
Yeah, there'’s always
some fire to put out.
What did you need?

28:50.641 --> 28:54.863
I was wondering, do you think
you could help me fix this?

28:59.041 --> 29:02.088
Ark 3 tech? Fancy.

29:03.654 --> 29:06.745
Power supply broke loose.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.746
Aren'’t you
an engineering trainee?

29:07.746 --> 29:10.705
This is first-year stuff.

29:10.705 --> 29:12.228
What can I say?
I play a lot of hooky.

29:17.277 --> 29:18.147
Fixed.

29:24.937 --> 29:28.157
It says it'’s booting up
to Ark 15'’s comm systems.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.768
I really wish
you hadn'’t seen that.

29:51.398 --> 29:54.270
Kelly to Angus.
I got my WD fixed.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.184
Where are you?

29:56.359 --> 29:58.100
Helena?

29:58.100 --> 30:00.407
Oh, no. Just me this time.

30:05.412 --> 30:09.111
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

30:09.111 --> 30:12.549
Uh, I mean,
it was too close before.

30:12.549 --> 30:16.727
She suspected. I told her
she was being ridiculous.

30:16.727 --> 30:19.861
- Then we'’re all clear.
- No.

30:19.861 --> 30:23.517
We have to stop.
We'’ll get caught.

30:23.517 --> 30:24.779
This is a mistake.

30:28.565 --> 30:31.525
There was a time
when Helena was the mistake.

30:31.525 --> 30:32.787
You almost left her.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.269
I wasn'’t in my right mind.

30:36.269 --> 30:38.967
Decarbonization, Klampkins--

30:38.967 --> 30:41.230
I pushed her away.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.580
- I was being self-destructive.
- No, no, don'’t--

30:43.580 --> 30:45.756
don'’t reduce me
to another bad choice,
like your flings.

30:45.756 --> 30:49.848
I'’m not.
You know I care for you.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.981
It'’s just with Ark 1
and Proxima, it'’s a second
chance for Helena and me.

30:52.981 --> 30:56.376
It could be
a second chance for us.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.595
Helena has just always
been there for me,

30:58.595 --> 31:00.684
even after my indiscretions.

31:08.344 --> 31:11.695
Well, I wonder if Helena
would forgive you for this one.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.309
- Are you threatening me?
- You'’re the genius.
What do you think?

31:19.442 --> 31:24.839
I think that you do not
want to ruin your lovely
friendship with my wife.

31:24.839 --> 31:27.537
I think you know
how dangerous she can be
when she turns on someone.

31:46.643 --> 31:50.125
- What are you doing?
- There'’s been a coup.

31:50.125 --> 31:52.867
- So, you'’re--
- Cutting off the food supply.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.609
Then they'’ll have to listen.

31:55.609 --> 31:58.394
I'’m serious!
We'’re going to take the ship
back for Sharon.

31:58.394 --> 32:01.093
It'’s so cute that you want
to stage a one man revolution.

32:01.093 --> 32:02.921
Well, we have to do something.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.141
We need to have faith in Trust.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.664
No!

32:07.664 --> 32:10.232
We need faith in the leader
who'’s consistently

32:10.232 --> 32:12.191
saved our lives
over the last couple months.

32:17.326 --> 32:20.503
What? What?

32:20.503 --> 32:23.463
- You trust me, don'’t you?
- Yeah, of course.

32:26.292 --> 32:29.469
I believe in Trust.

32:29.469 --> 32:32.341
- He built the ark.
- Yeah.

32:32.341 --> 32:35.301
Just give him a chance.

32:37.259 --> 32:38.434
For me.

32:46.268 --> 32:47.400
Maybe you'’re right.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.840
Maybe I should see
how this plays out before
doing anything rash.

32:55.234 --> 32:58.193
Good.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.890
Because I'’m really
looking forward

32:59.890 --> 33:00.979
to being with you on Prox B.

33:09.465 --> 33:12.860
- I'’m here! I'm here!
- Thank you.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.081
Ensign Selander
sliced open his hand
and needs a painkiller.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.953
We'’ll give it a few
minutes to take effect,

33:18.953 --> 33:20.172
then I'’ll set the arm.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.091
Thank you
for coming so quickly.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.310
Oh, don'’t give it
a second thought.

33:28.310 --> 33:29.659
It'’s my exercise for the day.

33:29.659 --> 33:30.921
I hate to keep you
on call like this,

33:30.921 --> 33:32.358
but it really does help.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.362
We'’re missing sedatives.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.582
You have the only key
to this cabinet.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.803
I'’m sorry.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.767
I-- I'’m sorry.

33:50.767 --> 33:52.813
I never considered this
might be a temptation for you.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.554
No, it'’s not that.

33:54.554 --> 33:57.470
I-- I didn'’t...

34:00.342 --> 34:02.692
I gave the sedatives to Trust.

34:02.692 --> 34:04.477
That'’s how he relieved
the command crew of duty.

34:04.477 --> 34:05.347
What?

34:07.567 --> 34:10.787
- I picked the wrong side.
- Uh, damn right, you did.

34:10.787 --> 34:13.138
- What--
- I really thought
he'’d pick me.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.574
Okay, I don'’t wanna know
what that means.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.576
Right now, we have to
find a way to help Garnet.

34:16.576 --> 34:18.578
It'’s too late for that.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.014
Eva, once people know
what Trust did, I mean--

34:20.014 --> 34:22.582
Trust isn'’t the problem.
It'’s Helena.

34:22.582 --> 34:24.801
She pulls the strings.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.499
Once they have power,
she'’ll do anything to keep it.

34:30.894 --> 34:33.506
This never would'’ve happened
to Captain Lester.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.073
You can'’t
second-guess yourself.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.641
Going to Ross 128
was the right call.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.427
- But I handled it
the wrong way.
- Mm.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.865
I gave a difficult order
and expected everybody
to blindly follow.

34:46.345 --> 34:49.174
Isn'’t that how
it'’s supposed to work?

34:49.174 --> 34:50.436
I mean,
you said it yourself.

34:50.436 --> 34:52.220
Your job is to give them
what they need.

34:54.004 --> 34:56.877
What they need
is to feel safe.

34:56.877 --> 34:59.227
All right,
once you'’re back in charge,

34:59.227 --> 35:02.230
we'’ll have a big shipwide
kumbaya drum circle, okay?

35:09.281 --> 35:12.197
FTL recharge complete.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.984
Initiate FTL.
Take us to our new home, Eva.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.774
- What the hell?
- Problem?

35:24.774 --> 35:29.388
- I'’m locked out of the FTL.
- Let me see.

35:29.388 --> 35:33.696
Is this some trick?
Some petty attempt to use
my tactics against me?

35:33.696 --> 35:36.873
Why would I do that?
I agree with going to Proxima B.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.266
Then who did this?

35:41.051 --> 35:42.270
I had nothing to do with it.

35:46.318 --> 35:47.884
You know what
you have to do, dear.

35:47.884 --> 35:49.843
Everyone on this ship
is counting on you.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.934
You'’re right.
You'’re always right.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.896
Look, I could
hack this eventually,

35:59.896 --> 36:01.681
but we'’ve already wasted
too much time.

36:01.681 --> 36:05.293
Whoever did this needs
to unlock the controls

36:05.293 --> 36:08.296
or Garnet, Brice,
and Strickland will die.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.517
I'’m purging
the holding cell'’s air.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.917
<i>Warning.
Oxygen venting.</i>

36:20.917 --> 36:24.704
- Let us out now!
- Help!

36:24.704 --> 36:28.577
We'’re losing oxygen!

36:28.577 --> 36:30.710
<i>Griff to bridge.
We'’re losing air
in the holding cell</i>

36:30.710 --> 36:32.625
and I'’m locked out.

36:32.625 --> 36:35.584
Yes, life support seals the air
when it'’s decompressing.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.151
We have people in there.

36:37.151 --> 36:40.241
Leave it.
It'’s under control.

36:40.241 --> 36:43.636
The hell with that.
I didn'’t sign up for murder.

36:43.636 --> 36:46.160
- The helmets?
- They only work with the suits.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.162
They have to register a seal.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.192
Don'’t let the prisoners'
deaths be on your hands.

37:18.192 --> 37:21.239
Mr. Trust,
you'’re better than this.
You'’ve made your point.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.590
- Turn the air back on and--
- You will sit in that chair
and do as you'’re told.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.769
How much time do we have left
until they suffocate?

37:29.769 --> 37:30.944
Probably less than a minute.

37:32.815 --> 37:35.949
Stop! It'’s done.

37:35.949 --> 37:38.343
Put the air back.

37:38.343 --> 37:39.474
Thank you, Miss Nevins.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.316
You really thought that
I would kill innocent people?

37:55.316 --> 37:56.622
Who do you think I am?

37:56.622 --> 37:58.406
I thought
you were William Trust,

37:58.406 --> 38:00.539
the genius who tried
to save the human race.

38:00.539 --> 38:04.934
But you'’re just
a power hungry monster.

38:04.934 --> 38:08.068
- What happened to you?
- William.

38:14.466 --> 38:15.989
This girl is
gonna be a problem.

38:17.817 --> 38:19.514
I think she'’s learned
her lesson.

38:19.514 --> 38:22.474
No, dear.
We need to make
an example of her.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.959
Are you okay?
- What happened?

38:29.959 --> 38:32.135
The bridge vented your oxygen.
It was Trust.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.834
- Why didn'’t you free us?
- I tried.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.488
But I was locked out
until he reversed it.

38:36.488 --> 38:39.404
Now that you know
what kind of man Trust is,

38:39.404 --> 38:42.842
are you gonna
lock us back in here?

38:42.842 --> 38:47.281
Miss Nevins,
please tell my wife

38:47.281 --> 38:49.805
that you are smart enough
to fall into line.

38:49.805 --> 38:52.634
Or what?
You threaten to murder
more people?

38:52.634 --> 38:54.375
I think we'’re
well past threats.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.072
You'’ll hack your way
out of any cell

38:56.072 --> 38:59.119
- we put you in, won'’t you?
- Damn straight, I will.

38:59.119 --> 39:02.818
Well, then you'’ve made
the decision for us.

39:02.818 --> 39:06.082
If we can'’t lock you up,
we have to send you
out the airlock.

39:06.082 --> 39:10.565
- The hell you will.
- So be it. Take them both.

39:12.088 --> 39:13.351
This has gone too far!

39:13.351 --> 39:15.570
You can shut up
or you can join them.

39:15.570 --> 39:18.138
It'’s time to stand down,
Mr. Trust.

39:21.663 --> 39:22.925
Oh, sorry!

39:40.203 --> 39:42.684
- Damn.
- What?

39:42.684 --> 39:44.120
I wish he'’d put up
more of a fight.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.122
I wanted to get
a few more punches in.

39:46.122 --> 39:50.213
Sharon-- oof!

39:50.213 --> 39:52.477
That'’s a bit harsh,
don'’t you think?

39:52.477 --> 39:54.043
He led a mutiny,
so, no, I don'’t think.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.049
I'’m so disappointed
in you, Felix.

40:01.877 --> 40:04.793
- Brice.
- No.

40:04.793 --> 40:06.621
Please, listen to me.

40:06.621 --> 40:09.319
I don'’t want to hear anything
that you have to say.

40:21.854 --> 40:24.596
I just want it on record
that Eva risked her life for me.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.556
Well, at least
she did one thing right.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.777
What she should have done
is what I understand
you did, Alicia.

40:33.213 --> 40:35.084
Lock them out of the system.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.478
Yeah, well,
that almost got you killed.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.219
I'’m so sorry about that.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.830
It was the right thing to do.
You may go.

40:48.881 --> 40:53.755
The only reason you two
aren'’t locked up right now

40:53.755 --> 40:55.540
is because you did
the right thing in the end.

40:55.540 --> 40:58.543
But that doesn'’t change the fact
that you helped with a coup.

40:58.543 --> 41:02.372
- Sharon--
- You will speak when your
commander tells you to speak.

41:03.983 --> 41:08.204
I understand the crew
were just following orders,

41:08.204 --> 41:10.076
but that'’s because you two
enabled Trust and Lane.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.908
We'’re still deciding
whether or not
to lock you up with them.

41:18.693 --> 41:21.609
So you both better choose
your next words very carefully.

41:21.609 --> 41:24.786
Now you may speak.

41:24.786 --> 41:27.702
Ark 1 will never make it
to Ross.

41:34.056 --> 41:36.015
Report!

41:36.015 --> 41:38.844
Proximity alert.
There'’s a ship is approaching.

41:38.844 --> 41:40.715
- From where?
- I don'’t know.

41:41.934 --> 41:44.806
That'’s Ark 15!

41:44.806 --> 41:47.113
Trust'’s shield,
can we fire it up?

42:00.605 --> 42:04.870
- Damn.
- It looks like Mr. Trust

42:04.870 --> 42:06.524
didn'’t calculate for the lack
of quantum tunneling

42:06.524 --> 42:08.569
- to keep the
negative energy going.
- Translation?

42:08.569 --> 42:11.398
- Trust'’s shield doesn't work!
- You see, Sharon?

42:11.398 --> 42:13.487
- You were right.
- Kinda wish I wasn'’t.

42:15.707 --> 42:17.839
We'’re in the middle
of space.

42:17.839 --> 42:19.232
How did Ark 15 find us?

42:33.812 --> 42:36.466
Someone would like
to see you, Mr. Trust.

42:38.643 --> 42:41.471
Ark 15, I have him.
