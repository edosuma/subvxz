00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.320
Dad?

00:16.320 --> 00:17.760
- Kelly.
- Dad!

00:17.760 --> 00:21.120
It was them Peckham Boys, Dad. They
got me at the lockup down the yard.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.880
Leonard, round up your cousins
and get down there!

00:23.880 --> 00:25.360
- I'm going too, Dad.
- No way.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.080
There was a time when the Lord name
counted for something.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.080
Look at you now. Light him up.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.040
No. Please!

00:33.040 --> 00:36.880
Did your uncle ever mention the name
Ernesto Alvarez to you?

00:36.880 --> 00:38.440
No. Why?

00:38.440 --> 00:40.480
They met around the time
he was killed.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.000
Hola muchacha.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.040
They're fucking Gypsies.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.640
I'll get shot of them when I want.
It's my land.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.360
Let's find these fucking deeds!

00:55.800 --> 00:58.160
See that police officer
you ran into?

00:58.160 --> 00:59.520
Yeah?

01:00.840 --> 01:02.280
He's dead, baby.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.480
It's Cindy.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.960
She's hiding something from us, Kel.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.080
She weren't for me anyway.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.200
I always knew she was a wrong 'un.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.880
It's nothing.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.280
How did you know
I was in here anyway?

Everyone knows this is all

02:22.320 --> 02:24.760
Well, it's a good thing
you're here, Barney.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.560
Opportunity knocks.
I'm off to Alabasas.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.520
Pay me what you owe
and then you can fuck off.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.360
No, no, no, you don't understand.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.240
I'm here to offer you Peckham boys
a deal of a lifetime.

- Yeah.

Yeah, I've got it. Come on, then.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.520
What's the catch?

02:59.400 --> 03:00.840
There ain't one.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.160
- How much?
- Five grand.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.000
No.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.240
Two grand.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.360
Well, that was easier than
pushing a granny over in the snow.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.880
Come to my office
and collect the readies.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.400
I'm not coming back here.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.080
State of it.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.400

Grandma sent me.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.320
You wanted a silencer, right?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.040
Yeah.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.400
You wanna know where
those bullets are headed?

04:17.400 --> 04:20.320
It's just a warning.
Yeah, it might get ugly, Kel.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.800
His name's Eddie Smith.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.240
Cindy's fella. He's just got out of
the nick and he's game.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.240
What do you mean, he's game?
I heard he ironed someone out.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.600
You know what you do
- with that, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.120
It's not my first rodeo.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.360
You've never even ridden

Adelante.

05:29.560 --> 05:33.680
Firstly... let me apologise
for the grand entrance

05:33.680 --> 05:36.040
and the flashing lights
at Club Paradiso.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.200
It really wasn't necessary.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.560
But we've never had a chance
to show off like that.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.920
You see, until you arrived,

05:43.920 --> 05:47.720
the only deaths in this part
of the Costa were the elderly.

05:47.720 --> 05:51.200
And now, well, I'm at a loss,
you know.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.920
I was hoping you could fill me in.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.160
You're the policeman.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.320
Well, it's, um...

05:58.320 --> 06:01.080
...it's clear that
your uncle was out of his depth.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.480
Now, witnesses place
you and Cindy Carter

06:05.480 --> 06:06.920
having lunch with him

06:06.920 --> 06:10.400
the day he rowed with
Ernesto Alvarez at Club Paradiso.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.640
But, from my memory,
you saw nothing.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.720
Furious, Tony went to Escobells
with a gun and confronted Ernesto.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.720
All hell broke loose.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.720
Everybody presumed dead...

06:26.800 --> 06:31.160
Until Ernesto was found alive
with a bullet in his chest.

06:31.160 --> 06:35.200
And I told Cindy that he was
recovering in hospital.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.400
Sadly, he succumbed to his injuries.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.400
But just before he died...

06:44.400 --> 06:46.080
...he had a visitor.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.240
And they left...

06:56.240 --> 06:58.840
...this earring behind.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.600
Don't cry, darling.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.840
We don't shoot our wounded
in this family.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.280
When Gene made a pledge to you...

07:26.280 --> 07:28.360
...we all did.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.720
Thanks, Ma.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.600
So why on earth do they think
Gene killed someone?

07:38.480 --> 07:40.480
The guy that murdered Tony...

07:40.480 --> 07:42.280
...Ernesto Alvarez,

07:42.280 --> 07:43.880
he died in hospital.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.520
They think Gene did it.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.480
No-good cunts. All of 'em.

07:52.560 --> 07:56.160
Just cos they eat octopus don't make
the police down here any better.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.120
My boy, a killer?

08:01.720 --> 08:03.240
Are they mad?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.080
Now, you know what I think?

08:29.240 --> 08:33.040
I think that, while you
paid respects to your uncle,

08:33.040 --> 08:35.520
Cindy took revenge for his murder

08:35.520 --> 08:38.400
and left this little souvenir behind.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.000
Tell me I'm right and you can
walk out of here a free man.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.920
Do you know what I think?

08:48.920 --> 08:51.720
Go, please, tell me, amigo.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.040
I think that if you had anything
that resembled real evidence,

08:56.040 --> 08:57.840
you'd have arrested her, and not me.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.960
As it is, you're just
shaking the tree

09:01.960 --> 09:03.880
to see if anything falls, I get it.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.720
You're sensing
I might be the weak link.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.120
The truth is, you've got nothing
and you know it.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.160
Look at you.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.640
A sheriff...

09:21.960 --> 09:24.760
...of a sleepy one-horse town
with zero crime,

09:24.760 --> 09:26.160
and then boom...

09:27.240 --> 09:29.520
...it all kicks off
when the Lords ride in.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.320
Like something out of a two-bob
airport novella, ain't it?

09:37.080 --> 09:39.640
Most of the English over here
are criminals.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.680
But not all of us.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.360
So unless you're gonna charge me...

09:50.960 --> 09:52.320
...time to salir.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.040
Tea's shit, mate.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.040
So...

10:38.040 --> 10:42.120
...looks like the apple didn't fall
so far from the tree after all.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.840
Look, I'm sorry, Dad.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.160
The man who killed Uncle Tony
died in the hospital.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.040
They was just asking me about him.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.560
What did you say?

10:53.560 --> 10:55.760
Nothing. I don't know anything.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.640
Then what you sorry about, hm?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.440
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.200
You avoiding me is embarrassing.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.000
Not coming home for Christmas...

11:10.000 --> 11:11.240
...embarrassing.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.000
But getting arrested...

11:16.680 --> 11:18.000
You drive.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.280
A-hem.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.400
- What?
- Your partner's widow,
Mrs Russo is here.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.000
- Now?
- Yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.520
For fuck's sake.
All right, bring her in.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.760
Hiya.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.600
Thanks for coming down.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.160
Do you mind?

11:54.160 --> 11:56.440
No, of course not.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.600
Been on my own with him
since his dad was murdered.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.080
There we go.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.200
Do you wanna take a seat?

12:15.680 --> 12:17.120
I, er...

12:18.360 --> 12:19.880
...I just wanted to reassure you

12:19.880 --> 12:22.680
we're doing everything we can
to find David's killers.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.680
You know, my husband thought
you were the bee's knees.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.640
The way you brought him up
- from traffic duty.
- Yeah.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.520
He rated you.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.080
He was a good lad.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.200
They're gonna pay
for what they took from you.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.520
You have my word on it.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.640
I heard they fled the country.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.840
Yeah.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.440
Unfortunately, yeah.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.320
And you let 'em escape.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.000
We're gonna find them, Amelia.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.240
I promise you, whatever it takes.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.840
Fighting talk.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.240
I like it.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
But my David is dead.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.120
And whatever comfort I may have had
in seeing justice done...

13:13.600 --> 13:15.000
...that's gone too.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.560
And it's your fucking fault... woman.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.840
'What did the police do to you?'

13:33.840 --> 13:35.240
Just digging.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.720
- They found your earrings.
- Fuck!

13:37.720 --> 13:40.520
Without the other one,
they can't prove it's yours.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.320
They've got nothing.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.760
Right?

13:43.760 --> 13:46.520
They can't pin anything on us,
we're in the clear.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.040
I promise.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.680
We're home free.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.800
No, we're not.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.840
Your brother's worked out
the land's worth 50 grand.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.120
He said he'd tell your dad
they should flip it

13:58.120 --> 13:59.840
and fuck off back to Bermondsey.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.400
Well, that's not happening.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.920
Cind, we ain't come this far
for nothing.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.440
Maybe you should tell him
about the hotel.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.720
You know, try and get him
- on the hook.
- Have you met my dad?

14:14.720 --> 14:17.760
He'd never entertain the idea
of us building on that land,

14:17.760 --> 14:19.800
because he didn't think of it himself.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.480
That's his mentality.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.640
That's why I got as far away
from him as I possibly could.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.440
Well, whether you like it or not,

14:32.440 --> 14:35.200
he owns the land now,
and we need him.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.480
Cos if they sell up and go back
to London, we're stuck here.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.480
Potless. Squatting in
someone else's house.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.560
Like Uncle fucking Tony.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.800
What's the weather like out there?
'Sunshine and blue skies.'

14:47.800 --> 14:51.720
Kids flying kites.'Typical. Sun
only comes out when you go away.'

14:51.720 --> 14:53.640
Where you at with that lock-up?

14:53.640 --> 14:56.600
'It's sorted, Dad.'Good boy.
How much d'you get?

14:57.640 --> 15:00.000
What?'You heard.'

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah, pushed him hard, Dad.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.280
He went over like a granny
in the snow.'How much?'

15:05.280 --> 15:07.840
'A few grand.'Good.
Well, get that money sharpish.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.640
We ain't got money to eat
and God knows how long it'll take

15:10.640 --> 15:12.600
to sell that land.
'Yeah, sweet, Dad.'

15:12.600 --> 15:15.680
So, what's it like there, anyway?
Nice birds?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.960
Listen, Kel.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.160
You're the only one I trust.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.960
And I need my general,
here with me. You get it?

15:21.960 --> 15:24.880
Yeah, that's cushty, Dad.
Really cushty.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.000
Hey, we'll have a nice bit of
lobster when I get out there.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.800
'Lobster? I fucking hate lobster.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.800
'You know how much
that land is worth?'

15:31.800 --> 15:34.720
£50,000 for the Lords.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.280
'Fucking hell.'Yeah, exactly.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.560
That's plenty for us
to get back in the game.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.440
We'll be back in south London
and on top before you know it.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.120
Ow! God, it stings!

15:45.120 --> 15:47.480
You should've used the Piz Buin
I gave you.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.880
- Len, ssh!
- Sorry, Dad.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.680
Kel, it's Ma.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.000
'All right, Mum?'

15:54.000 --> 15:58.200
That little thing,
I asked you to do. Any good?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.480
Yeah. Yeah.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.840
Name's Eddie Smith.
He's a right wrong 'un.

16:02.840 --> 16:06.480
He lives up on the flats
on Nelson Wa... Way.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.960
'Good boy. You gonna flop on him?'

16:09.960 --> 16:12.520
Oh! Fucking wanker!

16:12.520 --> 16:15.040
Your kid brother deserves
to know the truth.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.400
Don't you think?

16:16.400 --> 16:20.120
'It's all in hand, Ma. I got the
yogga. I'm gonna stick it on him.'

16:20.120 --> 16:21.360
That's it.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.520
All I ask is that
we look out for each other.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.760
Piss off.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.000
No.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.480
I will not sit here
and listen to you masticating.

16:57.480 --> 17:01.640
Then licking the crisp dust off your
fingertips. It's disgusting, no.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.600
What do you think he's up to?

17:09.600 --> 17:11.240
I don't know.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.160
We just need something illegal.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.760
Stolen goods, theft,
anything with a bit of jail time.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.520
That way we can get him
to roll over on the brother

17:19.520 --> 17:21.360
before he fucks off to Spain.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.560
Without Kelly, we can't get to Gene.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.320
Without Gene, we're fucked.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.600
Hello?

18:09.480 --> 18:12.680
What the fuck are you doing here?
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

18:12.680 --> 18:15.960
- Are you trying to rob me?
- No,
I'm not, I'm a friend of Cindy's.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.720
- Cindy's?
- Yeah.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.080
Cindy.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.720

Gitano community here

19:22.200 --> 19:24.160
that live on your land.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.560
Our land?

19:25.560 --> 19:27.880
Yes, and as the new landowners,

19:27.880 --> 19:31.200
my father would like to welcome you
to come over for dinner tonight.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.160
And celebrate with our people.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.400
It would be an honour
to have you as our guests.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.680
I don't fucking think so.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.320
Dad, come on.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.800
No, it would...

19:41.800 --> 19:44.600
...it would be our honour.
No, Son, no.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.160
Dad, please.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.880
We'd love to.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.160
Gracias.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.120
A gift.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.400
From your land.

19:55.400 --> 19:56.760
A tradition.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.720
Dad, what have you got to say?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.240
Gracias. Gracias.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.280
We appreciate you coming.
I'll see you out.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.680
Gypsies on our land?
Maybe they have a right to roam.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.040
Well, unless they've got 50 grand,
they can fuck off back there.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.280
- Leonard.
- Fucking hell, Dad.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.440
No, no, no, fuck off, Len.
No, no, no.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.040
Sooner we sell this land
and get home, the better.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.680
I'm going in. It's fucking hot.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.160
What the fuck are you doing
with this anyway?

20:32.160 --> 20:34.040
I heard you just got out of jail.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.160
Yeah. TDA, mate.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.840
I stole a car.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.080
Hardly crime of the fucking century.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.560
How did you wind up in the nick, then?

20:45.760 --> 20:48.040
Look at me... you fool.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.640
I'm not sure how I'm going to
break this one to Ma.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.760
Fucking hell. If the social sees
the state of this gaff...

20:59.760 --> 21:01.400
I'm 16.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.280
Socials don't give a fuck.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.600
And anyway, I'm just here
till my mum gets back.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.080
Oh, mate, she's not coming back,
is she?

21:09.080 --> 21:11.880
What you chatting about?
She killed a policeman.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.440
She's on the run in Spain
with me brother.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.840
What?

21:15.840 --> 21:19.360
- She killed Babylon?
- No, it weren't
murder. It was an accident.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.520
- Why Spain?
- Here, look.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.600
- Have that.What?
- Less you know,
the better, all right?

21:29.600 --> 21:31.400
I've already said too much.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.080
Wish I could do more for you,
but I'm leaving for Spain myself.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.800
You look after yourself, yeah?

21:43.240 --> 21:44.880
Thanks for not shooting me.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.280
Listen, Dad, I know you want to sell
up and go home, but hear me out.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.720
I found it hidden in the games room.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.520
What is it?

21:55.520 --> 21:57.680
It's a design for a resort town.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.400
Hotels, apartments, golf courses,
swimming pools.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.640
Even a cheeky little
Giorgi Armani shop.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.360
Don't you see?

22:05.360 --> 22:09.600
This is why Uncle Tony was buying up
all the land. He was gonna build it.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.840
Well, we all know
he was full of shit.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.120
That's not the point, Carl.
Dad, you own this land now.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.720
What, we're gonna build a town?

22:16.720 --> 22:19.520
Turn that shitty old bit of land
into fucking St Tropez?

22:19.520 --> 22:21.600
Do me a favour,
you fucking ice cream.

22:21.600 --> 22:25.520
- Well, why not?
- Well, what the fuck
- do we know about building?
- Yeah.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.400
Well, nothing, but the Gitanos do

22:28.400 --> 22:30.800
and that's the reason
we need to keep them sweet.

22:32.200 --> 22:36.040
Listen, Dad... you play this right
and you could be back in the game.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.680
Just imagine, how all them mugs
back in London will feel

22:39.680 --> 22:42.800
seeing you plotting up with a lardy
on your penthouse balcony.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.600
This is more than just 50 grand.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.480
Think big, Dad. That's what you do.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.760
This could blow everything out
of the water

22:48.760 --> 22:51.240
and put you right back
where you deserve to be.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.160
Right on fucking top.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.880
But to do that, we need
those Gitanos on side.

22:55.880 --> 23:00.040
You're talking bollocks, mate.
We haven't got a dollar to our name.

23:00.040 --> 23:01.920
We're totally fucking potless.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.840
Can't even afford to get back
to Bermo,

23:03.840 --> 23:06.440
and you're suggesting
we build a fucking hotel?

23:06.440 --> 23:08.480
You've got some fancy ideas, kid.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.240
Why not? Hm?

23:18.600 --> 23:20.560
You should listen to him.

23:21.640 --> 23:24.560
You're all hands, Son.
Start using your canister.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.800
OK, let's break bread
with the Gitanos.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.160
I mean...

23:31.160 --> 23:32.760
...fuck it.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.080
What's the worst that could happen?

23:36.600 --> 23:39.240
Len, bring a blade just in case.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.400
Well done, Son. Well done.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.960
Barney?

24:07.960 --> 24:09.680
Barney.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.720
Just come to pick up that cash.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.200
It's there.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.800
Feels a bit light.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.800
Mind if I, er...

24:25.800 --> 24:27.800
Go on. Knock yourself out.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.760
- A thousand pound.
- Hm?

24:34.760 --> 24:37.240
- It's a thousand pound.
- Yeah.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.000
Isn't that what we agreed?

24:41.960 --> 24:43.200
Yeah.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.800
What am I supposed to tell my dad, then?

24:45.800 --> 24:49.520
Tell him he's an irrelevant old man.
And no-one's scared of him any more.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.440
And you... you're a fucking
pretender. Look at you.

24:56.920 --> 24:57.920
Please.

24:57.920 --> 25:01.440
Now, your little brother, the one
who killed the gavver, fucking hell.

25:01.440 --> 25:04.080
I can't go back with a grand.
He's got more bollocks

25:04.080 --> 25:05.880
than the lot of you put together.

25:05.880 --> 25:09.120
Now fuck off
before I lose my patience.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.560
Empty the peter, now!

25:14.520 --> 25:15.920
OK.Yeah.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.320
I want everything in that safe.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.760
Sure.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.280
Now, move.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.680
I said move!

25:29.000 --> 25:30.960
Well, come on, then.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.440
- The whole thing, yeah?
- Yeah.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.680
Open it.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.640
- Agh!
- Fucking...!Agh!

25:52.040 --> 25:53.720
You're finished, you mug!

25:55.080 --> 25:56.480
Shit!

25:59.320 --> 26:01.160
I'll fucking get you for this.

26:04.320 --> 26:05.760
Sorry. OK?

26:06.800 --> 26:08.120
You're fucked.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.400
You're fucked!

26:48.440 --> 26:49.880
Who the fuck are you?

26:51.120 --> 26:53.320
Stay shtoom.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.000
If you wanna get out of here.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.760
Oi! Oi!

27:03.760 --> 27:05.400
Fucking hell!

27:05.400 --> 27:06.760
Who the fuck's that?

27:17.120 --> 27:19.960
It's funny seeing our boys change.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.760
One minute, they're off
gallivanting around.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.200
The next, they're back in the fold.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.160
Making moves.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.000
I'm proud of you, Alb.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.880
It was smart bringing Gene
back into the family like that.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.160
He thinks in a way
his brothers don't.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.120
It's all up there.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.000
He might open the door.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.240
But it'll be me walking through it.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.120
Truth is, Alb,...

27:49.160 --> 27:51.400
...I don't give a fuck who opens it.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.600
I just wanna be back in the room.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.320
You will be, Ma.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.000
You will be.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.120
♪ HUMAN LEAGUE: Mirror Man ♪

28:24.880 --> 28:28.000
Fucking state of this place -
it's a khazi.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.080
Welcome. We are honoured you came.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.720
This is my father, Diego.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.120
Tia Maria.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.000
It's like wine, but...
a little bit posher.

29:10.400 --> 29:14.040
Carl, babe, don't do that.
Give a shit.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.680
Look at us.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.800
Sat here with our clans,
enjoying each other's company,

29:24.800 --> 29:26.320
having a nice time.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.040
You and me...

29:31.040 --> 29:32.640
...come from nothing.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.160
But we've got...

29:34.160 --> 29:37.320
...family, freedom.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.680
You ever think about moving on?

29:45.720 --> 29:48.400
I mean... Spain's a big country.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.840
I-I'm just saying.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.560
You know, you wander.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.520
That's your game, right?

29:58.520 --> 29:59.760
Right?

30:09.760 --> 30:12.440
So this whole community
live on the land?

30:12.440 --> 30:14.360
Mostly everyone lives in town.

30:14.360 --> 30:17.000
But my father, he'll never leave.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.560
What about you guys?
What do you want?

30:20.560 --> 30:22.920
Your family owns the deeds
to this land.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.400
But we have history.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.200
So I hope we can all
get along in peace.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.200
That's why I asked you here.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.080
Look, our accents might be different

30:32.080 --> 30:34.240
but our history's closer
than you think.

30:35.280 --> 30:38.040
Me and my family have lived
on the outside all our lives,

30:38.040 --> 30:39.680
we just wanna live in peace too.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.720
Maybe even prosper together?

30:42.720 --> 30:45.120
- Salute.
- Salute.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.200
You all right, love?

30:54.200 --> 30:55.600
Hm.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.600
Funny lot, aren't they?

31:00.520 --> 31:02.280
You seem comfortable here.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.680
Good people, these.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.280
I should know.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.640
Didn't know you were Gypsy.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.080
Romany.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.800
Before I met Alb.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.960
That's why they call me Mint Ma.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.640
Used to graft the herbs
up Kings Cross.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.840
Full of surprises, me.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.040
Mm.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.520
'Her name's not Cindy Carter.
It's Mercy Wynters.'

31:29.880 --> 31:34.080
Last registered occupant of the
address you followed Kelly Lord to.

31:34.080 --> 31:37.320
Ten years for a firearms offence,
but no other arrests.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.320
Registered to the same address.

31:46.920 --> 31:49.520
That's the little shit
- who stole my car.
- Mm.

31:49.520 --> 31:51.680
Hid adoptive name is Eddie Smith.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.120
But his birth name is Wynters.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.600
He's her son.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.960
16.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.560
Just out of borstal.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.960
Have you got anything else
- on the mother?
- No.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.000
She dropped off the face of
the earth after she got released.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.640
So she changed her name
to Cindy Carter

32:12.640 --> 32:15.160
and she's on the run
with a wanted Lord boy.

32:15.160 --> 32:17.360
I mean, what the fuck's that
about, guv?

32:18.440 --> 32:20.760
Sadly, you're never gonna
get to find out.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.960
Sorry, I don't understand, sir.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.280
Unauthorised surveillance.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.080
Intimidating a witness.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.360
Putting a fellow officer's life
at risk.

32:32.360 --> 32:35.160
You want to get another one killed,
do you?

32:37.600 --> 32:38.920
And for what?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.280
Are you any closer to arresting
Gene Lord?

32:42.280 --> 32:43.640
Hm?

32:43.640 --> 32:45.200
No, sir.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.040
Kelly Lord?

32:48.960 --> 32:51.960
No, sir.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.520
Cos he's left for Spain.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.600
To meet his brother in Alabasas,

32:55.600 --> 32:57.240
where he can't be arrested.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.920
So you threw away your whole career
for nothing.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.800
No, sir.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.000
For Russo... Oh, for fuck's sake!

33:09.000 --> 33:12.120
This is what happens when you let
a woman do a man's job.

33:13.280 --> 33:16.000
You're suspended without pay
until further notice.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.640
Cunt!

33:25.280 --> 33:26.800
I used to love this place.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.240
My old man brought me in here...

33:30.240 --> 33:31.800
...just the two of us.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.680
I was allowed
one knickerbocker glory...

33:36.960 --> 33:39.560
...but had to keep it on the QT
from me brothers.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.160
Just like a little thing
between me and Dad.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.920
Where's the rest of your family, then?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.200
Well, you must have a dad.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.600
My dad died when I was a kid.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.400
It's just me and my mum.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.360
At least I thought it was.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.520
I see.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.240
Well... thanks.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.880
You know, for...

34:12.000 --> 34:13.280
...what you did.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.360
Thieving skills come in handy sometimes.

34:16.360 --> 34:17.920
No, I'm serious.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.640
If you're serious,
then take me with you.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.040
To Spain.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.480
You owe me.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.280
I just wanna see my mum.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.200
I wish I could.

34:36.360 --> 34:39.120
See, I've gotta go through the slips mate.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.640
The police'll be looking for me.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.520
Here.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.040
Go on.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.520
Mr Lord, come join me.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.480
No, you're all right, mate.
Not unless you've got any Boney M.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.680
Come on.

35:27.760 --> 35:31.480
Senora Lord, will you join me
for this dance?

35:31.480 --> 35:33.640
Carly, hold this, I'm on.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.760
All right.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.440
Ma.

35:39.440 --> 35:40.920
Looking good, Ma.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Go on, Ma.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.480
So beautiful.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.080
Enough!

36:32.320 --> 36:33.440
Gypo...

36:33.440 --> 36:35.320
...I want you off my land.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.920

36:36.920 --> 36:38.720

- Dad.

36:40.520 --> 36:44.680
You take your caravans and you
fuck off back to Rome, Pikey!

36:44.680 --> 36:46.120
Ahora metiera de la ciudad!

36:46.120 --> 36:47.200
Dad!

36:47.200 --> 36:48.600
Hey! Que, que, que?

36:50.440 --> 36:51.600
Fuck off.

36:53.560 --> 36:56.000
Leonard, the blade.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.040
Mm-mm.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.320
You come back when you're not
with your friends.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.200
Peace, you said.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.360
- Lola.
- Gene...
Lola, please... leave it.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.760
Leave it.

37:23.720 --> 37:26.280
What have you done, Dad?
You just fucked everything.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.440
He's got his hands
all over your mother!

37:28.440 --> 37:31.360
Right, let's get the fuck

I fucking checked it.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.960

You're too busy lifting weights,

42:31.280 --> 42:34.520

43:56.200 --> 43:58.200

43:59.440 --> 44:01.360
Not just your face, but...

44:01.360 --> 44:03.400
...deep inside, right here.

44:06.200 --> 44:08.000
I've always stood by you, Alb.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.040
Even when you were down.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.680
Those times you couldn't
get out of the feather.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.240
Family is everything to me.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.600
You know that.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.400
I didn't marry a man who can't stand
to see his wife have a good time...

44:26.880 --> 44:30.120
...who sits around pitying himself.

44:31.160 --> 44:34.040
Wondering why his life didn't
turn out the way he hoped.

44:35.120 --> 44:36.400
No.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.560
I married a dynamic...

44:41.720 --> 44:43.200
...a charming man.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.200
A man who saved me from hell...

44:48.280 --> 44:49.760
...who could protect me...

44:51.800 --> 44:53.560
...a man who had vision.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.640
Gene's right.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.800
There's something here for us.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.120
That place, on this land.
Call it intuition...

45:07.120 --> 45:08.920
...but I can feel it.

45:12.040 --> 45:13.720
There's a future here.

45:13.720 --> 45:15.480
A fortune too.

45:20.600 --> 45:22.480
I've given you everything, Albert.

45:23.720 --> 45:27.720
But I will not sit back and watch
this opportunity pass us by.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.360
I'm not going home.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.080
I'm staying here.

45:37.520 --> 45:40.400
And I suggest, if you want me...

45:40.400 --> 45:42.480
...if you want this family,

45:42.480 --> 45:46.200
that you do whatever it takes,
everything in your power,

45:46.200 --> 45:47.880
to make it right again.

45:49.160 --> 45:51.000
Otherwise, you'll grow old alone.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.680
Gene...

46:18.680 --> 46:20.320
...my boy.

46:22.120 --> 46:24.360
You fancy coming for a drive
with me?

46:30.360 --> 46:33.240
I didn't give the best account
of myself last night.

46:33.240 --> 46:36.600
So I was thinking that we could
go back up to the Gitanos and say...

46:37.760 --> 46:40.480
...and say, let's start again.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.880
They trust you.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.520
So do I.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.280
I need you with me.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.920
My general.

46:58.400 --> 46:59.800
Papa...

47:15.560 --> 47:17.480
We're just here to talk.

47:17.480 --> 47:19.400
We've nothing to say to you.

47:19.400 --> 47:20.920
What he did...

47:20.920 --> 47:23.120
...it's unforgiveable, I know that.

47:24.280 --> 47:27.480
But we have a lot more to gain
from friendship than war.

47:27.480 --> 47:29.440
You live on this land.

47:29.440 --> 47:31.440
We own it.

47:31.440 --> 47:34.160
So we need to find a way
to live side by side in peace.

47:37.680 --> 47:39.200
Dad?

47:40.960 --> 47:42.640
What the boy said...

47:42.640 --> 47:44.960
...we need to learn to get on.

47:48.760 --> 47:50.240
I was insulted.

47:50.240 --> 47:52.840
Where I'm from,
a man can't let that slide.

47:54.760 --> 47:56.360
I was protecting my family.

47:56.360 --> 47:57.720
You understand that.

47:59.120 --> 48:01.680
I made a rick, it was a mistake.

48:04.360 --> 48:07.240
I have met... bad men...

48:08.360 --> 48:10.640
...stupid men, arrogant men.

48:11.840 --> 48:14.480
All gentlemen, compared with you.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.520
You say you protect your family.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.560
You know nothing about family!

48:20.560 --> 48:22.760
Even your boy can see that.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.560
You're not a father...

48:25.560 --> 48:27.000
...not a husband!

48:28.480 --> 48:32.400
You'll never build your hotel
on this land.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.080
Please.
