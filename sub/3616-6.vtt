NOT A CHEF ANYMORE.

00:16.212 --> 00:18.984

BE 300 POUNDS BY NOW.

00:19.084 --> 00:21.524
MAYBE I SHOULD
MAKE ANOTHER BATCH.

00:21.624 --> 00:24.314
UM, PIPER, REMEMBER
WHEN YOU TOLD ME

00:24.414 --> 00:26.770
TO TELL YOU
WHEN YOU WERE OBSESSING?

00:26.870 --> 00:28.477
I'M NOT OBSESSING.

EVERYTHING TO BE

THINK YOU'RE DOING
ENOUGH ALREADY?

FOR GOD SAKES,
YOU'RE HOSTING
THE THING

00:37.902 --> 00:39.061

NOT EVEN CLOSE
TO WENDY ANYMORE.

00:39.070 --> 00:40.466
THAT IS PRECISELY WHY
I AM DOING ALL OF THIS.

00:40.566 --> 00:42.962

10:25.827 --> 10:27.850
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE KIDS

10:27.951 --> 10:30.016
IF I CAN'T EVEN BE
AT SOMEBODY ELSE'S
BABY SHOWER?!

10:30.116 --> 10:32.429
WHAT?

10:32.529 --> 10:34.054
NOTHING. NEVER MIND.

10:34.154 --> 10:36.425
OK, I'LL MEET YOU
OUTSIDE.

10:36.525 --> 10:37.899
THE LEAST I CAN DO
IS SAY GOOD-BYE.

10:40.814 --> 10:44.460
UH, WENDY, I'M SORRY,
I'VE GOTTA GO.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.208
SOMETHING'S COME UP.

10:47.308 --> 10:48.664
NOW?

10:48.765 --> 10:50.414
BUT WE HAVEN'T EVEN
HAD THE CAKE YET.

10:50.514 --> 10:51.829
YOU'RE GONNA MISS
THE BEST PART.

10:51.929 --> 10:53.303
YEAH, I KNOW.
STORY OF MY LIFE.

10:53.844 --> 10:57.425
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

10:59.505 --> 11:03.028
Paige: SO,
WE'VE GOT A SPELL

11:03.128 --> 11:04.027
TO VANQUISH
A CHAMELEON,

11:04.127 --> 11:05.399
BUT WE'RE NOT
GOING TO USE IT?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.190
I DON'T GET IT.

11:07.290 --> 11:08.663
WELL, YOU VANQUISH HIM
ONLY IF YOU HAVE TO.

11:10.495 --> 11:13.102
THE GOAL HERE
IS TO TRY AND
INTERROGATE HIM.

11:13.202 --> 11:15.017
FIND OUT
WHAT THE SOURCE
IS PLANNING.

11:15.117 --> 11:16.890
OK, BUT I'M THINKING
THAT THIS GUY'S

11:16.990 --> 11:18.470
NOT GONNA BE
SO EAGER TO
SPILL HIS GUTS.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.970
HE'LL SPILL.
I'LL SEE TO THAT.

11:21.070 --> 11:23.093
NO, YOU CAN'T COME.
HE SAW YOU WITH US,

11:23.193 --> 11:25.506
WHICH PROBABLY MEANS
THE SOURCE HAS
SOME BOUNTY HUNTER

11:25.606 --> 11:27.380
READY TO ATTACK YOU
OR CAPTURE YOU
OR SOMETHING.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.336
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

11:30.436 --> 11:31.513
WELL, IT DOESN'T
MAKE IT ANY LESS
DANGEROUS.

11:31.523 --> 11:33.293
SO THE QUESTION
STILL STANDS,

11:33.393 --> 11:35.581
HOW DO WE GET A DEMON
TO STOP AND CHAT WITH US?

11:35.681 --> 11:37.662
WELL...

11:37.762 --> 11:39.120
PIPER CAN FREEZE HIM
AND THEN UNFREEZE
HIS HEAD.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.826
SHE'S DONE THAT
BEFORE.

11:41.926 --> 11:43.365
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

11:43.465 --> 11:45.173
I DON'T KNOW.

11:46.796 --> 11:48.128
Cole: WHY?
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

11:49.459 --> 11:50.792
MAYBE...

11:52.084 --> 11:53.831
WE COULD TELL HIM
TO OFFER THE SOURCE
A DEAL INSTEAD.

11:56.205 --> 11:59.642
DEAL?
WHAT KIND OF A DEAL?

11:59.742 --> 12:02.349
WELL, SOMETHING
LIKE, HE STOPS
COMING AFTER US,

12:02.449 --> 12:05.387
AND WE STOP
GOING AFTER HIM.

12:05.487 --> 12:07.220
WHAT?

12:07.320 --> 12:08.479
OF COURSE, THAT WOULD
MEAN WE'D HAVE TO STOP

12:08.489 --> 12:11.091
GOING AFTER ALL
OF HIS DEMONS, TOO,

12:11.191 --> 12:13.173
WHICH WOULD
BE FINE BY ME.

12:13.273 --> 12:14.379
IT WOULD STOP ALL
THE CONSTANT ATTACKS.

12:14.479 --> 12:16.435
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO THINKS SHE'S
BUMPED HER HEAD?

12:17.144 --> 12:19.724
YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS, PIPER.

12:20.723 --> 12:22.579
ACTUALLY, I'VE NEVER
BEEN MORE SERIOUS
IN MY LIFE.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.410
THINK ABOUT IT.

12:25.510 --> 12:26.910
THIS COULD BE
AN OPPORTUNITY

12:27.010 --> 12:28.628
FOR US TO GET OUT
OF THE DEMON FIGHTING
BUSINESS ONCE AND FOR ALL.

12:28.638 --> 12:31.321
WAIT...

12:31.421 --> 12:32.457
WHAT, AND JUST
GIVE UP ON YOUR DESTINY?

12:32.467 --> 12:35.610
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WE HAVEN'T ALREADY
FULFILLED IT?

12:35.710 --> 12:38.025
I MEAN, GOD KNOWS

12:38.125 --> 12:39.233
WE'VE SAVED SCORES
OF INNOCENTS ALREADY.

12:39.333 --> 12:41.313
MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH.

12:41.413 --> 12:43.103
MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR SOME OTHER
WITCHES TO TAKE OVER

12:43.203 --> 12:46.018
AND LET US GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

12:46.118 --> 12:47.657
ISN'T IT WORTH A TRY
IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT
WE MIGHT BE GETTING?

12:48.199 --> 12:51.762
NO MORE PUTTING
THINGS ON HOLD,

12:51.862 --> 12:54.069
VACATIONS,
FRIENDS, KIDS.

12:54.526 --> 12:56.400
I CAN'T GIVE UP NOW.

12:58.107 --> 12:59.671
WE ARE SO CLOSE.

12:59.771 --> 13:01.503
WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT
THE SOURCE IF WE
CAN,

13:01.603 --> 13:04.459
AND IF NOT
JUST FOR OUR SAKE,

13:04.559 --> 13:06.290
THEN...

13:06.390 --> 13:08.056
AT LEAST FOR PRUE'S.

13:09.387 --> 13:11.095
FINE. I JUST HOPE
WE DON'T END UP
WHERE SHE DID.

13:24.832 --> 13:28.270
SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.203
WE'VE CHECKED
BOTH ALLEYS TWICE.

13:30.368 --> 13:32.783
WELL, THE CHAMELEON'S
GOTTA BE HERE SOMEWHERE,

13:34.364 --> 13:36.805
'CAUSE THE CRYSTAL
NEVER LIES.

13:36.905 --> 13:38.261
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

13:38.361 --> 13:39.635
BUT I'M GETTING
A NOT-SO-GOOD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.176
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL CHECK
ONE MORE TIME,

13:42.276 --> 13:43.965
AND THEN WE'LL
CALL IT QUITS.

13:44.065 --> 13:45.254
PHOEBE,
YOU AND PAIGE
CHECK THAT ALLEY,

13:45.354 --> 13:47.005
I'LL GO CHECK
THAT ALLEY.

13:47.105 --> 13:48.252
WAIT. SPLIT UP?

13:48.352 --> 13:49.376
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

13:49.476 --> 13:50.584
MAYBE IT'LL
LURE HIM OUT,
WHO KNOWS?

13:50.684 --> 13:53.247
IF YOU GET NERVOUS,

13:53.347 --> 13:54.580
SAY THE
VANQUISHING SPELL,

13:54.680 --> 13:55.829
AND KEEP
YOUR EYES PEELED.

13:55.929 --> 13:57.636
HE COULD
BE ANYTHING.

14:33.311 --> 14:37.000
WERE YOU EXPECTING ME
TO FREEZE?

14:37.100 --> 14:39.141
PHOEBE, PAIGE!

14:43.928 --> 14:47.298
Paige: OHH!

14:52.129 --> 14:55.192
Leo: PIPER?

14:55.292 --> 14:57.648
PIPER?

14:57.748 --> 14:59.438
PIPER, ARE YOU OK?

14:59.538 --> 15:02.894
OW...

15:02.994 --> 15:04.934
MY HEAD HURTS.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.515
I BET IT DOES.
YOU HIT IT PRETTY HARD.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.055
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:09.155 --> 15:10.278
I THINK SO.
WHAT HAPPENED?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.550
WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS

15:13.650 --> 15:14.675
WHEN YOU HAVE
ONE OF YOUR EPISODES.

15:14.775 --> 15:16.839
YOU THREW YOURSELF
AGAINST A WALL.

15:16.939 --> 15:18.796
EPISODES?

15:18.896 --> 15:21.960
I DIDN'T
THROW MYSELF.

15:22.060 --> 15:25.164
WHAT ARE
YOU WEARING?

15:25.264 --> 15:26.205
Man: BOYD
POISONED ME,

15:26.305 --> 15:27.621
I KNOW ABOUT
THE ALIENS,

15:27.721 --> 15:28.995
PART OF THE
CONSPIRACY,

15:29.095 --> 15:30.369
AND I'M GONNA
TELL THE WORLD!

15:30.469 --> 15:31.409
CHECKMATE!

15:31.509 --> 15:32.408
BOW DOWN
AND WORSHIP ME.

15:32.508 --> 15:34.323
IT'S OK,
THOSE ARE JUST
THE OTHER PATIENTS.

15:34.423 --> 15:36.154
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

15:36.254 --> 15:39.111
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

15:39.211 --> 15:40.110
YOU'RE AT
THE SANITARIUM.

15:40.210 --> 15:42.541
YOU'RE HOME.

15:47.369 --> 15:51.059
WHERE'S ALL
OUR FURNITURE?

15:51.159 --> 15:53.058
LEO, WHAT ARE
ALL THESE PEOPLE

15:53.158 --> 15:55.137
DOING IN OUR HOUSE?

15:55.237 --> 15:56.470
OUR HOUSE?

15:56.570 --> 15:57.510
PIPER,
HALLIWELL HOSPITAL

15:57.610 --> 15:58.843
IS HARDLY OUR HOUSE.

15:58.943 --> 16:00.092
ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE
LIVE HERE, TOO.

16:00.192 --> 16:01.674
HALLIWELL HOSPITAL?

16:01.774 --> 16:03.380
IS THAT SOME KIND
OF JOKE?

16:03.480 --> 16:05.005
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

16:05.105 --> 16:06.004
PLEASE CALM DOWN.

16:06.104 --> 16:08.125
NO, LEO,
I WILL NOT CALM DOWN.

16:08.225 --> 16:09.499
SOMETHING VERY STRANGE
IS GOING ON,

16:09.599 --> 16:11.122
SOMETHING DEMONICALLY
STRANGE.

16:11.222 --> 16:12.831
THE DEMON
MUST HAVE CAST A SPELL

16:12.931 --> 16:15.286
AND CHANGED THE HOUSE
AND CHANGED YOU.

16:15.386 --> 16:17.826
PHOEBE? PAIGE?

16:17.926 --> 16:20.281
EASY, LADY, RELAX.

16:20.381 --> 16:22.031
LET GO OF ME!

16:22.131 --> 16:23.571
LEO,
DON'T JUST STAND THERE!

16:23.671 --> 16:25.110
PROBLEMS, DR. WYATT?

16:25.210 --> 16:26.109
THAT'S HIM.

16:26.209 --> 16:27.775
THAT'S THE DEMON.

16:27.875 --> 16:28.983
DEMONS AGAIN?

16:29.083 --> 16:31.104
PIPER, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS
THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE.

16:31.204 --> 16:33.103
THERE ARE NO DEMONS.

16:33.203 --> 16:34.577
THEY'RE JUST FIGMENTS
OF YOUR IMAGINATION.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.182
WANT TO BET?

16:37.282 --> 16:38.557
EVIL HIDING
IN PLAIN SIGHT,

16:38.657 --> 16:40.097
I USE THIS SPELL
WITH ALL MY MIGHT

16:40.197 --> 16:42.344
TO STOP YOUR CHANGING
FORM AND SHAPE.

16:42.444 --> 16:44.235
THIS VANQUISH
SEALS YOUR FATE.

16:44.777 --> 16:46.942
DOESN'T REALLY
RHYME, DOES IT?

16:48.398 --> 16:50.921
SORRY.

16:51.021 --> 16:52.085
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.084
THAT SPELL
SHOULD'VE WORKED.

16:54.184 --> 16:55.625
PIPER, WHY DO YOU INSIST
ON DEMONIZING ME

16:55.725 --> 16:58.081
AND EVERY PSYCHIATRIST
WHO'S EVER TRIED TO HELP YOU?

16:58.181 --> 17:00.996
LET GO OF ME.
I GOT TO BLOW HIM UP.

17:01.096 --> 17:03.075
I'M GONNA
BLOW YOU UP.

17:03.175 --> 17:04.169
HER VIOLENT IMPULSES
ARE RETURNING.

17:04.178 --> 17:05.116
HEY, STRAITJACKET!
YES DOCTOR.

17:05.215 --> 17:08.238
PIPER, WHY WON'T YOU
LET DR. ALASTER HELP YOU?

17:08.338 --> 17:11.318
I DON'T NEED HIS HELP.
I NEED <i>YOUR</i> HELP.

17:11.417 --> 17:13.525
GET THIS GUY OFF OF ME
SO I CAN USE MY POWERS.

17:13.625 --> 17:16.164
PIPER, YOU DON'T
HAVE POWERS.

17:16.498 --> 17:17.954
YOU NEVER DID.

17:20.037 --> 17:21.059
WHAT?

17:21.159 --> 17:22.159
AAH!

17:23.824 --> 17:25.056
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

17:25.156 --> 17:26.888
THIS IS MY HOUSE,
TOO!

17:26.989 --> 17:28.428
PAIGE?
I CAN DO ANYTHING
I WANT!

17:28.528 --> 17:30.969
YOU'RE HURTING ME!

17:31.069 --> 17:32.716
PAIGE! PAIGE!

17:32.816 --> 17:33.966
A DEMON
TOOK OVER THE HOUSE.

17:34.066 --> 17:35.255
ORB THE HECK
OUT OF HERE!

17:35.355 --> 17:36.838
TAKE HER TO ISOLATION
SO SHE DOESN'T HURT HERSELF.

17:36.938 --> 17:38.836
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:38.936 --> 17:40.751
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:40.851 --> 17:41.750
WAIT. LEO!

17:41.850 --> 17:43.039
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

17:43.139 --> 17:44.764
Piper: WAIT A MINUTE.
HEY, HEY.

17:45.888 --> 17:47.036
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

17:47.136 --> 17:48.036
PLEASE LISTEN TO ME
FOR A SECOND.

17:48.136 --> 17:49.159
HE'S A DEMON.

17:49.259 --> 17:50.283
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE UP
ON YOU, PIPER.

17:50.383 --> 17:51.533
HA HA.

17:51.633 --> 17:52.740
WE'RE GONNA FREE YOU
OF THESE DELUSIONS.

17:52.840 --> 17:53.739
I PROMISE YOU.

17:53.839 --> 17:54.738
SHUT UP. PHOEBE! PHOEBE!

17:54.838 --> 17:57.361
I CAN GIVE YOU
EVERYTHING YOU WANT

17:57.461 --> 17:58.360
IF ONLY
YOU'LL LET ME HELP.

17:58.460 --> 17:59.901
[GRUNTING]

18:00.001 --> 18:01.774
THIS ILLNESS
HAS ALREADY CONSUMED

18:01.874 --> 18:03.188
MORE THAN 3 YEARS
OF YOUR LIFE.

18:03.288 --> 18:05.520
DON'T LET IT ROB YOU
OF ANY MORE.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.309
YOU'RE NOT A WITCH.

18:08.409 --> 18:09.950
YOU ONLY THINK YOU ARE.

18:14.071 --> 18:17.635
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:17.735 --> 18:19.174
IT'S JUST TAKING MORE MAGIC
THAN I REALIZED

18:19.274 --> 18:22.046
TO PROJECT INTO HER MIND.

18:22.146 --> 18:24.336
MORE THAN YOU HAVE,
PERHAPS?

18:24.436 --> 18:25.977
I ONLY MEAN
TO CAUTION YOU.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.457
THIS IS WEAKENING YOU,
MAKING YOU VULNERABLE.

18:29.557 --> 18:32.621
BUT THE BOUNTY I SEEK

18:32.721 --> 18:34.702
WILL MAKE ME MORE POWERFUL
THAN EVER.

18:34.802 --> 18:36.950
IF YOU CAN GET IT.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.210
NOBODY KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THE CHARMED ONES

18:38.220 --> 18:41.613
THAN I DO.

18:41.713 --> 18:43.402
I KNOW HOW TO BREAK
HER SPIRIT.

18:43.502 --> 18:46.082
I KNOW HER ACHILLES HEEL.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.163
IN HER DEEPEST HEART,
SHE NEVER WANTED TO BE A WITCH,

18:50.538 --> 18:53.059
YET SHE FEELS AN OBLIGATION
TO HER POWERS.

18:53.159 --> 18:56.849
YES, BUT YOU
SAID HER POWERS

18:56.949 --> 18:59.722
WON'T WORK
IN HER ILLUSION.

18:59.822 --> 19:01.969
THEY WON'T,

19:02.069 --> 19:04.425
AND ONCE SHE LEARNS
THAT PAINFUL LESSON,

19:04.525 --> 19:07.839
SHE'LL WILLINGLY
GIVE HERS UP.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.061
AND WITH THEM,
HER SISTERS, TOO.

19:20.135 --> 19:23.408
ANYTHING?

19:23.508 --> 19:24.947
I CAN'T SENSE PIPER
ANYWHERE.

19:25.047 --> 19:27.320
DOES THAT MEAN THAT...

19:27.420 --> 19:28.361
NO.

19:28.461 --> 19:30.042
HE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HER
IF HE WANTED HER DEAD.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.166
COLE--OH, MY GOD.

19:34.665 --> 19:35.937
Cole: I'M ALL RIGHT.
I'M ALL RIGHT.

19:36.037 --> 19:37.186
I JUST FOUND OUT

19:37.286 --> 19:38.269
THAT PIPER'S
IN THE UNDERWORLD.

19:38.369 --> 19:39.934
I THINK THE SOURCE HAS HER.

19:40.034 --> 19:40.934
Phoebe: THE SOURCE?

19:41.034 --> 19:42.141
ARE YOU SURE?
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

19:42.241 --> 19:43.807
FROM ANOTHER
CHAMELEON DEMON.

19:43.907 --> 19:45.012
I KIND OF SQUEEZED IT
OUT OF HIM.

19:45.112 --> 19:47.761
WELL,
WE'VE GOT TO FIND HER.

19:47.861 --> 19:49.050
THERE'S GOT TO BE A SPELL
IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

19:49.150 --> 19:51.942
AAH!

19:59.016 --> 20:02.081
PHOEBE?

20:02.181 --> 20:04.994
I SAW THE SOURCE

20:05.094 --> 20:06.552
STEALING THE BOOK
AND KILLING US

20:07.218 --> 20:10.615
WITH OUR POWERS.

20:10.715 --> 20:12.114
OUR POWERS?
HOW CAN HE GET OUR POWERS?

20:12.214 --> 20:14.902
MAYBE HE'S FIGURED OUT
A WAY

20:15.002 --> 20:16.900
TO GET THEM FROM PIPER.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.024
EXPLAINS WHY HE'S
KEEPING HER ALIVE.

20:18.124 --> 20:19.524
NO, BUT SHE CAN'T
GIVE THEM UP BY HERSELF.

20:19.624 --> 20:22.145
WELL, SHE CAN USING
THE RELINQUISHING SPELL
IN THE BOOK.

20:22.245 --> 20:24.520
WE BURNED THAT SPELL
3 YEARS AGO.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.267
IT DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.

20:26.367 --> 20:27.890
IT DOES IN HER MIND.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.239
THAT'S CRAZY.

20:30.322 --> 20:31.679
SHE'D NEVER SAY IT.
SHE'D NEVER GIVE UP HER POWERS.

20:31.779 --> 20:34.777
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS KIND OF
WILLING TO THIS MORNING?

20:35.983 --> 20:36.982
I'M JUST SAYING.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.920
LOOK,
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

20:41.020 --> 20:42.876
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.975
I'M SORRY.

20:45.974 --> 20:47.290
FORGET IT.

20:47.390 --> 20:48.872
MAYBE YOU AND I
SHOULD GO DOWN THERE,

20:48.972 --> 20:51.078
SEE IF I CAN SENSE HER.

20:51.178 --> 20:52.702
FOLLOW ME.

20:54.552 --> 20:56.798
OK. THERE'S A BUNCH OF
SUMMONING SPELLS WE CAN TRY.

20:57.018 --> 20:59.563
COME ON.

20:59.663 --> 21:00.701
Paige: THOUGHT YOU SAID
I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH

21:02.073 --> 21:03.678
FOR YOUR LITTLE COVEN.

21:03.778 --> 21:05.219
PAIGE, YOU ARE
UNDER A SPELL.

21:05.319 --> 21:06.923
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

21:07.023 --> 21:09.169
I TRIED
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.165
I EVEN TRIED TO PLAY
YOUR STUPID WITCHY
GAMES,

21:11.265 --> 21:13.536
BUT ALL YOU COULD DO

21:13.636 --> 21:14.575
WAS COMPLAIN ABOUT ME
AND MY STUFF,

21:14.675 --> 21:16.281
AND HOW WE
DIDN'T COMPARE
TO YOUR BELOVED PRUE.

21:16.381 --> 21:19.565
I'VE NEVER SAID THAT.

21:19.665 --> 21:21.271
HMM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

21:21.371 --> 21:22.642
IT'S OBVIOUS
THE WAY YOU TREAT ME.

21:22.742 --> 21:24.888
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE ME.

21:24.989 --> 21:26.552
PAIGE, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
WE'RE SISTERS.

21:26.652 --> 21:29.962
Dr. Alaster: YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY SISTERS.

21:30.062 --> 21:31.542
YOU'RE AN ONLY CHILD,
PIPER.

21:31.642 --> 21:33.580
YOU KNOW THAT.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.177
I'M GONNA BE SO HAPPY
WHEN I VANQUISH YOUR SORRY ASS.

21:37.299 --> 21:41.233
YOU USE IT TO EXPLAIN
THE THINGS YOU CAN'T ACCEPT,

21:41.333 --> 21:43.520
JUST LIKE YOUR BEST FRIEND
DID BEFORE SHE GOT WELL...

21:43.620 --> 21:46.349
PRUE.

21:46.449 --> 21:48.012
DON'T YOU DARE
TALK ABOUT PRUE.

21:48.112 --> 21:50.839
HERE WE GO AGAIN.
SAINT PRUE.

21:50.939 --> 21:53.916
Dr. Alaster:
YOU'VE NEVER FORGIVEN HER

21:54.016 --> 21:55.248
FOR FINALLY ACCEPTING
THAT SHE WASN'T A WITCH.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.493
YOU'VE CONVINCED YOURSELF
THAT SHE'S DEAD.

21:57.593 --> 22:00.114
SHE IS DEAD.

22:00.214 --> 22:01.568
NO, SHE'S NOT.

22:01.668 --> 22:02.916
WE RELEASED HER
3 MONTHS AGO.

22:04.081 --> 22:05.496
SHE'S RECOVERED.

22:07.574 --> 22:08.473
SHE'S FREE,

22:08.573 --> 22:10.261
JUST LIKE YOU COULD BE
IF YOU'D STOP FIGHTING IT.

22:10.361 --> 22:12.797
ACCEPT YOUR REALITY.

22:12.897 --> 22:14.087
LET ME OUT
OF THESE RESTRAINTS.

22:14.187 --> 22:15.625
I'LL SHOW YOU
SOME REALITY.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.182
I'M AFRAID YOU'D JUST
HURT YOURSELF AGAIN.

22:21.797 --> 22:25.332
I'M TRULY SORRY.

22:25.539 --> 22:26.871
LEO! LEO!

22:28.826 --> 22:30.846
AH, WOULD YOU STOP
WITH THE "LEO, LEO"?

22:30.946 --> 22:33.217
YOU'RE DRIVING ME
CRAZIER THAN
I ALREADY AM.

22:33.317 --> 22:35.420
UGH!

22:35.520 --> 22:36.585
PHOEBE.
PHOEBE, UNTIE ME.

22:36.685 --> 22:39.123
HURRY.
HURRY. HURRY.

22:39.223 --> 22:40.703
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
STOP OBSESSING.

22:40.803 --> 22:43.382
I'M NOT OBSESSING.
I'M...

22:44.213 --> 22:46.318
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

22:46.418 --> 22:47.522
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.

22:47.622 --> 22:48.812
NOT YOUR BEST.

22:48.912 --> 22:50.185
GOT MILK? OOH,
DON'T THINK SO.

22:50.285 --> 22:53.096
OK, JUST GET ME OUT
OF THESE THINGS.

22:53.196 --> 22:55.923
WE NEED TO REVERSE
THIS DEMON'S SPELL.

22:56.023 --> 22:57.378
AAH!

22:57.478 --> 22:58.918
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

22:59.018 --> 23:00.707
I SAW THE BACK
OF MY EYELIDS.

23:00.807 --> 23:02.494
WHAT'D YOU THINK I SAW?

23:02.594 --> 23:03.742
OH, NO, PHOEBE.
NOT YOU. NOT YOU, TOO.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.672
HURRY UP, LOONEY TUNES.
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

23:06.795 --> 23:08.042
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON,

23:10.870 --> 23:12.642
BUT WE GOT TO GET TO
THE <i>BOOK OF SHADOWS.</i>

23:12.742 --> 23:15.137
AND SINCE EVIL
CAN'T TOUCH IT,

23:15.237 --> 23:16.592
IT'S STILL GONNA BE
IN THE ATTIC, RIGHT?

23:16.692 --> 23:18.730
RIGHT? RIGHT?
LET'S GO.

23:21.433 --> 23:25.035
ALL RIGHT,
THE FIRST THING

23:25.135 --> 23:26.715
WE GOT TO DO IS--
WHERE'S PHOEBE?

23:27.089 --> 23:30.316
WHO CARES?

23:30.416 --> 23:33.393
SORRY, HAD TO
GRAB MY BROOM.

23:33.493 --> 23:35.431
FOR WHAT?

23:35.531 --> 23:36.429
WELL, FOR
FLYING, SILLY.

23:36.529 --> 23:38.052
[MAN YELLS IN PAIN]

23:38.152 --> 23:40.338
UH-OH.

23:40.438 --> 23:41.337
ANOTHER INNOCENT
TO SAVE!

23:41.437 --> 23:42.834
NO, PHOEBE, WAIT!

23:42.934 --> 23:44.266
[MAN YELLING]

23:46.968 --> 23:50.277
YOU CAN'T HURT ME.

23:50.377 --> 23:51.942
I'M THE MIGHTY
BELTHAZOR.

23:52.042 --> 23:54.437
Phoebe: STOP IT.

23:54.537 --> 23:56.159
HE'S NOT EVIL ANYMORE.
HE'S GOOD.

23:58.404 --> 24:02.065
WELL,
HE SURE FLEW.

24:05.349 --> 24:08.493
HI. STOP THAT.

24:08.593 --> 24:09.824
HAS ANYBODY
SEEN THE BOOK?

24:09.924 --> 24:11.072
I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

24:11.172 --> 24:12.236
I HID IT SO THE DOCTORS
WOULDN'T--

24:12.336 --> 24:13.584
I MEAN, THE DEMONS--
WOULDN'T FIND IT.

24:18.324 --> 24:21.427
WHAT...

24:21.527 --> 24:22.509
WHAT IS THIS?

24:22.609 --> 24:25.171
UGH.

24:25.271 --> 24:26.309
OH, GOD.

24:28.347 --> 24:29.537
YOU ARE NUTS.

24:29.637 --> 24:32.698
OK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW A DEMON

24:32.798 --> 24:35.733
COULD TAKE THE BOOK
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.123
UNLESS THIS ISN'T THE HOUSE.

24:38.286 --> 24:40.059
OK, I GOTTA GET YOU TWO
OUT OF HERE.

24:40.159 --> 24:42.761
MAYBE THAT'LL
BREAK THE SPELL.

24:42.861 --> 24:43.968
HOW COME THE SPELL
DIDN'T WORK ON YOU?

24:44.068 --> 24:45.714
HEY, DON'T QUESTION
THE RULES. SHH.

24:45.814 --> 24:48.726
COME ON, WE'LL GO
DOWN THE TRELLIS.

24:49.682 --> 24:51.286
Phoebe:
WHAT ABOUT COLE?

24:51.386 --> 24:52.493
I NEVER GET TO SPEND
ANY TIME WITH HIM.

24:52.593 --> 24:54.298
UH, WE'LL COME BACK
FOR HIM LATER.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.148
COME ON, COME ON.

24:58.248 --> 24:59.854
IT'LL BE FUN. HURRY.

24:59.954 --> 25:01.409
HURRY. FASTER.

25:03.238 --> 25:03.821
PIPER, DON'T.

25:13.219 --> 25:16.239
WHOO!

25:16.339 --> 25:18.111
I THINK WE LOST 'EM.

25:18.211 --> 25:19.691
WAIT A MINUTE.

25:19.791 --> 25:20.689
EVERYTHING
LOOKS NORMAL.

25:20.789 --> 25:23.100
THIS IS WRONG.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.097
WE SHOULD GO BACK AND TRY
AND GET THE DEMON TO TALK.

25:25.197 --> 25:27.302
I'M THINKING
HE'S NOT GONNA BE

25:27.402 --> 25:28.300
SO EAGER
TO SPILL HIS GUTS.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.022
Woman: HEY! HEY!

25:30.853 --> 25:31.960
HE TOOK MY PURSE!

25:32.060 --> 25:34.804
HEY!

25:37.009 --> 25:40.335
PIPER!
Paige: NO!

25:58.134 --> 26:02.126
I BELIEVE SHE'S
JUST LEARNED HER LESSON.

26:09.447 --> 26:13.297
Phoebe and Paige:
POWER OF THE WITCHES, RISE.

26:13.397 --> 26:15.667
COURSE UNSEEN
ACROSS THE SKIES.

26:15.767 --> 26:18.704
COME TO US,
WHO CALL YOU NEAR.

26:18.804 --> 26:20.783
COME TO US
AND SETTLE HERE.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.986
BLOOD TO BLOOD,
I SUMMON THEE.

26:23.086 --> 26:25.999
BLOOD TO BLOOD,
RETURN TO ME.

26:32.069 --> 26:35.713
ANY OTHER SPELLS
YOU CAN THINK OF?

26:35.813 --> 26:37.376
NO.

26:37.476 --> 26:39.123
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

26:39.223 --> 26:42.451
IF LEO AND COLE
CAN'T FIND HER...

26:42.551 --> 26:44.837
WHAT IS IT?

26:46.125 --> 26:47.123
SOMETHING THAT LEO SAID

26:49.787 --> 26:50.933
ABOUT THE POWER
RELINQUISHING SPELL

26:51.033 --> 26:52.681
BEING IN PIPER'S MIND.

26:52.781 --> 26:53.927
I TOLD YOU SHE'D
NEVER SAY IT.

26:54.027 --> 26:55.923
PAIGE,
YOU DON'T KNOW HER
AS WELL AS I DO.

26:56.023 --> 26:58.086
NO, BUT I AM
GETTING TO KNOW THE SOURCE.

26:58.186 --> 27:00.791
HE LIKES TO PLAY TRICKS
ON PEOPLE'S MINDS.

27:00.891 --> 27:02.162
I MEAN, GOD KNOWS
HE DID WITH MINE.

27:02.262 --> 27:03.908
HE ALMOST HAD ME KILL A GUY,
REMEMBER?

27:04.008 --> 27:05.864
YEAH, GO ON.

27:05.964 --> 27:07.860
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
HE'S TRYING TO DO TO PIPER--

27:07.960 --> 27:09.816
GET INTO HER MIND SOMEHOW.

27:09.916 --> 27:11.270
I MEAN, IF THAT'S
WHERE THE SPELL IS...

27:11.370 --> 27:13.225
THEN THAT'S PROBABLY
WHERE HE'S LOOKING FOR IT.

27:13.325 --> 27:16.427
AND IF HE CAN
GET INTO HER MIND,

27:16.527 --> 27:18.273
THEN WHY CAN'T WE?

27:21.974 --> 27:25.618
[GASPS]
Dr. Alaster: EASY.

27:25.718 --> 27:27.406
EASY.

27:27.506 --> 27:28.860
[GROANS]

27:28.960 --> 27:31.124
YOU'VE HAD A TERRIBLE
ACCIDENT.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.661
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

27:34.950 --> 27:36.970
YOU GOT HIT BY A CAR.

27:37.070 --> 27:40.006
THE DRIVER SAID
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TRY

27:40.106 --> 27:41.397
TO GET OUT OF THE WAY.

27:45.180 --> 27:48.657
PIPER, THIS DELUSION

27:48.757 --> 27:49.820
THAT YOU SOMEHOW
HAVE MAGICAL POWERS

27:49.920 --> 27:51.652
IS GONNA GET YOU
KILLED SOMEDAY.

27:51.752 --> 27:53.207
SHOVE IT.

27:54.247 --> 27:55.478
WHERE ARE
MY SISTERS?

27:55.578 --> 27:57.308
YOU MEAN YOUR ROOMMATES?

27:57.408 --> 27:58.886
THEY'RE SAFE DOWNSTAIRS.

27:58.986 --> 28:01.717
PIPER, HOW CAN I SAVE YOU
IF YOU WON'T SAVE YOURSELF?

28:01.817 --> 28:04.959
YOU HAVE TO WANT TO,
YOU HAVE TO WILL IT,

28:05.059 --> 28:08.161
OTHERWISE YOU'LL
JUST REMAIN LOST

28:08.261 --> 28:09.824
IN THIS FANTASY WORLD
OF YOURS.

28:09.924 --> 28:11.879
IT'S REAL,

28:12.877 --> 28:14.109
AND YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO CONFUSE ME.

28:14.209 --> 28:16.313
NO. NO,
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

28:16.413 --> 28:19.763
PIPER,
YOUR PSYCHOSIS

28:19.863 --> 28:22.177
IS BASED
IN THE FERVENT BELIEF

28:22.277 --> 28:24.215
THAT YOU'RE MAGICAL,

28:24.315 --> 28:26.002
AND YOU KNOW
THAT'S JUST AN ESCAPE.

28:26.102 --> 28:28.539
ESCAPE? WHAT ESCAPE?

28:28.639 --> 28:30.842
FROM SOME DEEP-SEATED PAIN,
SOME TERRIBLE LOSS--

28:32.424 --> 28:36.192
MOST LIKELY THE DEATH
OF YOUR GRANDMOTHER,

28:36.292 --> 28:39.725
WHICH IS, AFTER ALL,

28:39.825 --> 28:40.823
WHEN THIS SERIES
OF EPISODES BEGAN.

28:41.407 --> 28:43.070
END YOUR PAIN.

28:44.816 --> 28:46.712
YOU CAN DO IT.

28:46.812 --> 28:49.706
IN ONE OF OUR SESSIONS,

28:49.806 --> 28:51.430
YOU MENTIONED A POEM--
A SPELL YOU CALLED IT.

28:51.721 --> 28:55.447
ONE THAT RELINQUISHES
THE MAGICAL POWERS

28:55.547 --> 28:57.900
YOU THINK YOU HAVE.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.231
NO. GO AWAY.

28:59.331 --> 29:02.058
SAY THE SPELL, PIPER.

29:02.158 --> 29:04.139
IT'LL FREE YOU,
I PROMISE YOU.

29:04.239 --> 29:07.797
IT'LL YOU RELEASE YOU
FROM ALL

29:07.897 --> 29:09.129
THE CRIPPLING DELUSIONS
YOU HAVE.

29:09.229 --> 29:11.914
GET OUT.

29:12.014 --> 29:13.388
GET AWAY FROM ME.
GET OUT!

29:15.757 --> 29:16.756
YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO GIVE YOURSELF THE LIFE

29:19.709 --> 29:21.331
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

29:24.033 --> 29:27.469
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

29:27.569 --> 29:28.727
IS STOP PUTTING THE ILLUSION
OF BEING A WITCH

29:28.736 --> 29:30.481
IN FRONT OF IT.

29:31.726 --> 29:34.787
LEO.

29:34.887 --> 29:35.828
[GROANS]

29:35.928 --> 29:37.492
LEO, WHERE ARE YOU?

29:37.592 --> 29:39.588
[GROANS]

29:43.927 --> 29:47.028
LEO!

29:47.128 --> 29:48.291
SHE'S HURT.

29:50.700 --> 29:51.904
WHERE IS SHE?

29:53.609 --> 29:54.895
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T GET AN EXACT
READ ON HER.

29:58.719 --> 30:01.900
WELL, TRY HARDER.

30:02.000 --> 30:02.897
I CAN'T.

30:02.997 --> 30:04.228
THE SOURCE MUST'VE LEARNED
FROM THE LAST TIME.

30:04.328 --> 30:05.698
HE'S BLOCKING
PIPER'S SIGNAL.

30:07.818 --> 30:11.499
WELL, THEN WE HAVE
TO FIND THE SOURCE.

30:11.599 --> 30:13.202
HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

30:13.302 --> 30:15.611
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY.

30:15.711 --> 30:17.124
COLE.

30:34.988 --> 30:38.130
HEY.
