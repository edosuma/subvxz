We'll see you Thursday.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.405
Okay, bye.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.755
Are we having people over
on Thanksgiving?

00:16.799 --> 00:18.583
'Cause my butt's got
a date with this couch,

00:18.627 --> 00:20.237
and it's too late
to cancel.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.066
No, listen.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.895
I know we talked about
not doing anything for
Thanksgiving.

00:25.938 --> 00:27.549
Oh, no.

00:27.592 --> 00:28.941
That was my mom,

00:28.985 --> 00:30.856
and they really want us
to drive up this year.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.076
Allison, no,
it's not their turn.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.340
We have a system.
Respect the system.

00:36.384 --> 00:38.255
Well, your parents
aren't hosting.

00:38.299 --> 00:40.431
Yeah, because of their
Bell Biv Di-vorce.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.998
You've got to stop
calling it that.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.782
I will when it stops
being fresh.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.307
I was just so
looking forward

00:46.350 --> 00:48.048
to staying home
and doing nothing.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.571
I know you're tired,

00:49.614 --> 00:51.312
but we haven't been
up to Santa Barbara

00:51.355 --> 00:53.227
to see their new house.
It's been months.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.793
We all looked at it
on Zillow.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.926

They have avocado trees.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.321
Ken, I really want us
to go see them.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.671
It's important to me
and it's important to the kids

01:02.714 --> 01:05.108
and it should be important
to you.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.980
[SIGHS] Fine.
We'll go.

01:08.024 --> 01:12.376
I'll buckle up for a nice,
long medical chat
with your groovy dad.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.378
He's just trying
to connect with you.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.815
He's always sending me
articles to read.

did you check out

Ken, I live with you now.

and cigars and Aqua Velva.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.962
[LAUGHING]

01:34.964 --> 01:36.922
My dad's not all gruff
like that.

01:36.966 --> 01:39.099
[NORMAL VOICE] Please.
At our wedding, he gave me

01:39.142 --> 01:41.318
a "Welcome to the family"
handshake.

01:41.362 --> 01:44.060
I'd take that over one
of Jerry's full-body hugs.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.540
"Bring it in, babe.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.282

to reduce blood pressure.

And then if the drunk guy
we had bet on was able

01:57.900 --> 01:59.902
to knock the other drunk guy
unconscious,

01:59.945 --> 02:03.775
everyone in the alley
would pay my father a dollar.

02:06.996 --> 02:11.043
Clark, what's your favorite
Thanksgiving tradition?

02:11.087 --> 02:14.351
Well, you know,
mine's not quite as...
Hemingway-esque.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.527
But when I was little,
on Thanksgiving,

02:16.571 --> 02:18.050
my family would always sing

02:18.094 --> 02:20.052
that Doobie Brothers' song,
Black Water.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.185
Oh, yeah.
That funky Dixieland song.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.360
Yes.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.667
Was that song significant
in some way?

02:25.710 --> 02:27.321
Uh, yes, Allison.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.671
They sang it on
Thanksgiving. Keep up.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.195
I don't know why that song.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.589
Maybe because
our only boom box player

02:34.632 --> 02:37.374
had that tape stuck in it
for three years.

02:37.418 --> 02:40.725
Yeah. Yeah,
that's probably why.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.728
Anyway, to this day,
whenever I hear Black Water,

02:43.772 --> 02:47.036
it just takes me back
to some of the best moments
of my childhood.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.690
Oh, instead of
mashed potatoes,

02:48.733 --> 02:50.561
my mom would make
baked potatoes.

doing tomorrow?

03:04.793 --> 03:06.621
Ah, I'm just gonna see
what comes up.

03:06.664 --> 03:09.145
Does something usually
"come up" on Thanksgiving?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.625
Well, Allison,

03:10.668 --> 03:12.148
you got to live
the life you want,

03:12.192 --> 03:14.063

to serve dinner

you don't have to come.

to your sister's.

I am coming and that

what I tell him.

We've got a tree.They know.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.301
Listen.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.999
There's nothing I can say
to fix what happened.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.697
I just have to do better.

21:03.740 --> 21:07.657
And I know I can because
you always make me better,

21:07.701 --> 21:09.180
and that's why I love you.

21:09.877 --> 21:12.488
Apology accepted.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.710
