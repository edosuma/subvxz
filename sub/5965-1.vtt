<i>Edward Perriman Cole died in May.</i>

00:29.145 --> 00:34.082
<i>It was a Sunday afternoon,
and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.</i>

00:35.318 --> 00:39.448
<i>It's difficult to understand
the sum of a person's life.</i>

00:39.622 --> 00:43.581
<i>Some people will tell you it's measured
by the ones left behind.</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:47.195
<i>Some believe it can be measured
in faith.</i>

00:47.764 --> 00:49.994
<i>Some say by love.</i>

00:50.767 --> 00:54.396
<i>Other folks say life has
no meaning at all.</i>

00:54.971 --> 00:56.495
<i>Me?</i>

00:57.207 --> 00:59.038
<i>I believe that you measure yourself...</i>

00:59.209 --> 01:02.269
<i>... by the people who
measured themselves by you.</i>

01:03.179 --> 01:06.979
<i>What I can tell you for sure
is that, by any measure...</i>

01:07.150 --> 01:10.813
<i>... Edward Cole lived more in his last
days on Earth...</i>

01:10.987 --> 01:14.423
<i>... than most people manage
to wring out of a lifetime.</i>

01:15.191 --> 01:19.150
<i>I know that when he died,
his eyes were closed...</i>

01:19.329 --> 01:21.456
<i>... and his heart was open.</i>

01:28.438 --> 01:32.875
" Name the five presidents whose
last names begin with the letter H."

01:33.042 --> 01:34.509
H?

01:34.978 --> 01:39.176
Warren G. Harding,
Rutherford B. Hayes, Herbert Hoover...

01:39.382 --> 01:43.546
...and the two Harrisons,
Benjamin and William Henry.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.744
Ah.

01:44.954 --> 01:46.751
Thought I'd get you
with the double Harrisons.

01:46.956 --> 01:48.583
Ha-ha-ha.
- You're sick, you know?

01:48.758 --> 01:51.955
You think that's sick,
can you name their wives?

01:52.162 --> 01:54.562
- No.
- Neither can I.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.828
Yo, Cartey-car!
- Yo!

01:57.033 --> 01:59.228
- When they need the Camaro, man?
- Yesterday.

01:59.402 --> 02:00.426
Huh?

02:00.603 --> 02:02.833
- All right, I got one for you.
- All right.

02:03.006 --> 02:05.201
Who invented the radio?

02:06.843 --> 02:07.935
Ah.

02:08.110 --> 02:09.237
That's a hard one.

02:09.412 --> 02:11.846
- What do you know, I finally got you.
- No.

02:12.015 --> 02:14.916
I don't know if you want who
they think invented the radio...

02:15.084 --> 02:17.416
...or the person who
actually invented the radio.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.087
Well, in here it says...

02:19.289 --> 02:20.551
Marconi, right?

02:21.691 --> 02:22.715
Yeah, it ain't him?

02:22.892 --> 02:25.554
He's the one they generally think
invented the radio.

02:25.728 --> 02:30.028
In fact, he got a Nobel Prize for it
in 1909.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.962
Truth is a guy named Nikola Tesla...

02:32.135 --> 02:35.593
...patented the basic idea
for the radio in 1896.

02:35.772 --> 02:39.264
Same idea Marconi used for his patent
several years later.

02:41.945 --> 02:45.745
Tesla fought Marconi till
the day he died in 1943.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.974
Same year the Supreme Court ruled...

02:48.151 --> 02:50.483
...that Marconi's patent was invalid...

02:50.653 --> 02:53.486
...recognizing Tesla as
the inventor of the radio.

02:53.656 --> 02:54.714
Carter.

02:55.258 --> 02:56.657
You really are sick.

02:56.893 --> 02:58.793
Oh, hi, Ginnie.

02:59.329 --> 03:02.457
Well, good. About time.
What did they say?

03:07.637 --> 03:09.434
All right, what does that mean?

03:44.440 --> 03:49.173
Kopi Luwak.
The rarest beverage in the world.

03:49.579 --> 03:51.274
Take a whiff.

03:51.447 --> 03:52.675
Go ahead.

03:54.083 --> 03:57.541
Uh, Mr. Cole, the board is ready
to hear your proposal.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.779
Hold on just a second.

04:01.190 --> 04:03.158
Go ahead. Go on.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.459
Well?

04:13.036 --> 04:14.663
Really good.

04:16.372 --> 04:17.737
Really good.

04:17.906 --> 04:19.534
Mr. Cole. Sir?

04:21.411 --> 04:23.379
Do you know what a Philistine is, Jim?

04:24.147 --> 04:26.479
Sir, it's Richard.

04:26.683 --> 04:30.244
That's right, Phil.
Give them the spiel.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.557
Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
fellow supervisors.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.854
We at the Cole Group feel
the decline of the Winwood Hospital...

04:41.030 --> 04:43.897
...is a direct result of significant
fiscal mismanagement.

04:44.067 --> 04:47.400
- I beg your pardon, this hospital...
- Overhead costs are nearly double.

04:47.570 --> 04:50.334
Your lease and land costs were
similarly overbid.

04:50.506 --> 04:54.237
Donations have atrophied to the point
you've fallen far behind the curve...

04:54.410 --> 04:57.004
...in Research, Pediatrics,
Oncology and MRI.

04:57.213 --> 05:01.172
The Cole Group has privatized 15
public hospitals in seven years...

05:01.351 --> 05:03.911
...each of which now provides,
or will soon provide...

05:04.087 --> 05:07.022
...the highest standard of medical care
to their communities.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.715
- Despite being grossly understaffed?
- The better the doctor, the need...

05:10.893 --> 05:12.690
What about beds?
There are rumors...

05:12.862 --> 05:16.263
...you increased the number of patients
to the point of overpopulation.

05:16.432 --> 05:18.059
Patient density has always been...

05:18.234 --> 05:20.725
And your emergency rooms,
I mean, they are known...

05:20.937 --> 05:24.429
I run hospitals, not health spas.

05:24.674 --> 05:28.166
Two beds to a room, no exceptions.

05:28.611 --> 05:32.741
Look, I passed up a lunch
with Michelle Pfeiffer to be here...

05:32.949 --> 05:37.818
...so can we desist
from all of this inane posturing?

05:38.688 --> 05:41.714
Boys and girls, you need me.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.119
I do not need you.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.586
Now, there's a sizeable check
in this envelope...

05:47.797 --> 05:51.426
...let me know if you decide
to cash it.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.637
Mr. Cole, are you all right?

06:43.453 --> 06:44.647
What are you doing here?

06:45.388 --> 06:48.983
Oh, you know,
fighting for my life. You?

06:49.792 --> 06:51.783
Uh, no, I was just surprised...

06:51.961 --> 06:54.122
- and I don't care about the insurance!

06:54.297 --> 06:56.629
And tell Dr. Shit-for-Brains...

06:56.799 --> 07:01.395
...I wanna know everything about this
bleomycin drip he wants to get me on.

07:01.637 --> 07:03.901
I hear it eats your lungs.

07:04.140 --> 07:06.199
When I address Congress
next month...

07:06.375 --> 07:09.572
...I don't want to do it breathing
through a hole in my throat.

07:09.812 --> 07:13.009
- That's not exactly what happens.
- Who the hell is this guy?

07:13.182 --> 07:16.015
- Where's Thomas? Tom!
- In plain view, sir.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.881
- Hi, Tom.
- We're gonna move you into the bed.

07:19.055 --> 07:22.354
I can do it myself. I ain't dead yet.

07:28.331 --> 07:29.696
How about now?

07:34.337 --> 07:36.305
Have I fired you lately?

07:36.506 --> 07:38.406
Not since the Oprah incident.

07:41.177 --> 07:44.544
- That was a good one. Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah, it's good stuff.

07:52.188 --> 07:53.849
Who the hell is that?

07:54.056 --> 07:55.546
Who the hell are you?

07:56.893 --> 07:58.554
He said, "Who the hell...?"

07:58.728 --> 08:01.822
Oh, God. What am I, in the morgue?

08:02.698 --> 08:06.134
<i>That was the first time
I laid eyes on Edward Cole.</i>

08:07.069 --> 08:09.765
<i>An inauspicious beginning, to be sure.</i>

08:09.939 --> 08:12.601
Oh, spare me. Sweet Jesus.

08:12.775 --> 08:15.573
I hate these... I hate tubes!

08:18.714 --> 08:22.616
I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend the
next three weeks laying next to this guy.

08:22.785 --> 08:25.720
Zombie boy. Looks half-dead already.

08:25.888 --> 08:30.222
You can't have your own room.
It would create an enormous PR problem.

08:30.426 --> 08:33.293
I don't give a shit about PR.

08:33.462 --> 08:36.794
I want my own room.
It's my hospital, for chrissake.

08:37.133 --> 08:40.102
Don't tell me I can't have
my own room.

08:40.303 --> 08:41.895
No offense, pal.

08:42.071 --> 08:45.905
You have publicly defended this policy
countless times.

08:46.075 --> 08:50.409
You run hospitals, not health spas.
Two beds to a room, no exceptions.

08:52.515 --> 08:55.279
I've never been sick before.

08:55.451 --> 08:59.478
Okay, Dr. Eldridge will be in
in a minute to dot you up, okay?

08:59.655 --> 09:01.316
Dot me up.

09:06.896 --> 09:08.955
Jesus.

09:13.970 --> 09:14.994
Thomas...

09:16.639 --> 09:19.199
...don't let me wake up paralyzed.

09:20.109 --> 09:22.100
I'll do what I can.

09:27.917 --> 09:29.509
This really your hospital?

09:30.286 --> 09:32.811
Yeah, pretty much.

09:34.523 --> 09:37.219
Might wanna do something
about the pea soup.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.328
<i>By the morning of the surgery...</i>

09:42.498 --> 09:45.490
<i>... the cancer had spread so far
throughout Edward's body...</i>

09:45.668 --> 09:49.069
<i>... that the doctors gave him only
a 5 percent chance to survive...</i>

09:49.238 --> 09:54.175
<i>... but then, they didn't account
for how pissed off they'd made him.</i>

10:02.318 --> 10:04.047
Mm...

10:06.088 --> 10:08.556
No visitors come in to see him?

10:10.993 --> 10:14.053
He's been sleeping a lot
since they brought him back.

10:14.764 --> 10:15.822
Mm.

10:16.165 --> 10:19.066
That's another reason
I don't miss nursing.

10:19.235 --> 10:22.864
It's always so sad seeing
a patient like that, all alone...

10:23.072 --> 10:25.063
...after that kind of surgery.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.871
At least he's quiet.

10:35.351 --> 10:38.514
<i>Day after day,
out of sight, and almost out of...</i>

10:40.723 --> 10:42.350
Rachel called this morning.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.026
Really? How's she doing?

10:45.194 --> 10:50.097
She's auditioning for first violin
in next semester's symphony.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.929
That's wonderful.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.059
Need any more books?

11:19.395 --> 11:22.455
No, I'm... I'm fine.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.799
Got your meds for the night?

11:26.302 --> 11:28.236
Mm-hm. I already took them.

11:28.404 --> 11:29.666
How about pillows?

11:30.673 --> 11:33.938
I'm fine, Virginia, really. Thank you.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.413
You know, I could stay a while
if you want me to.

11:42.585 --> 11:46.851
No use both of us being useless
in the morning, right?

11:48.290 --> 11:49.757
Okay.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.184
She gone?

12:18.354 --> 12:19.787
What?

12:20.856 --> 12:24.952
As something of a
public health expert...

12:26.128 --> 12:29.962
...I believe more people die
from visitors...

12:30.599 --> 12:32.829
...than diseases.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.333
<i>"It's the Berries," for 600.</i>

12:38.541 --> 12:42.238
<i>This Swedish berry
is also known as the cowberry.</i>

12:42.478 --> 12:44.844
<i>- What is a lingonberry?
- Uh, what is a lingonberry?</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:47.710
<i>Correct!
- "It's the Berries," for 800.</i>

12:47.883 --> 12:52.252
<i>In a Top 40 hit of 1956,
this "Berry" told Beethoven to roll over.</i>

12:52.888 --> 12:54.412
Who is Chuck Berry?

12:54.623 --> 12:56.420
<i>Who is Chuck Berry?
- Yes.</i>

12:56.625 --> 12:57.717
Hey.

12:58.561 --> 12:59.892
Duke?

13:00.529 --> 13:02.224
You mind?

13:03.265 --> 13:05.699
Oh. Sorry. No.

13:05.935 --> 13:09.166
<i>- What is the Mariana Trench?
- What is the Mariana Trench?</i>

13:10.005 --> 13:11.336
Good morning, Edward.

13:12.174 --> 13:14.734
- Morning.
- How you feeling?

13:15.644 --> 13:17.271
Dumb question.

13:17.513 --> 13:19.140
How's that catheter?

13:19.348 --> 13:21.873
Don't know how I ever did without it.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.576
Ah, humor is a good sign.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.851
Kiss my ass.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.082
As is surliness.
It's one of your favorite flavors, right?

13:30.259 --> 13:33.251
- Yeah.
- Let's see what we got here.

13:33.429 --> 13:35.192
It looks good.

13:35.364 --> 13:38.629
All right, so the operation
went well, okay?

13:38.801 --> 13:40.632
All the post-op brain scans are clean.

13:40.803 --> 13:43.101
Now we go after the sarcoma
in the rest of your body.

13:43.272 --> 13:46.139
Now, unfortunately,
your blood markers are extremely high...

13:46.308 --> 13:48.970
...so I would like to begin chemo
this morning.

13:49.812 --> 13:53.111
Love the smell of chemo
in the morning.

13:53.315 --> 13:55.112
<i>Apocalypse Now, right?</i>

13:55.284 --> 13:56.911
Makes me feel like victory!

13:58.387 --> 14:00.378
- I'll check in with you later.
- All right.

14:00.556 --> 14:02.217
Say, doc? Doc?

14:02.424 --> 14:04.392
You think you could just
take a look at...?

14:04.593 --> 14:08.051
- Sorry, I'm late. Who's your doctor?
- He's Dr. Gibian.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.595
I'll let the nurse know.

14:11.133 --> 14:12.691
Appreciate it.

14:18.340 --> 14:19.500
Bitch, ain't it?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.270
<i>- What are quarks?
- What are quarks?</i>

14:25.447 --> 14:27.915
- How long you been here?
- Oh.

14:28.083 --> 14:32.520
In and out over the past few months.
Got me on an experimental treatment.

14:32.721 --> 14:36.316
<i>- What is the quadratic equation?
- What is the quadratic equation?</i>

14:36.492 --> 14:37.982
How rough is it?

14:39.361 --> 14:40.419
Chemo?

14:41.997 --> 14:43.521
Not too bad.

14:43.732 --> 14:45.927
If you don't mind
around-the-clock vomiting...

14:46.101 --> 14:48.126
...watching your veins turn black...

14:48.304 --> 14:51.501
...and feeling like your bones are
made of napalm...

14:51.674 --> 14:53.141
...it's a day at the beach.

14:53.776 --> 14:55.539
That's a relief.

14:56.679 --> 14:59.170
Of course, I hear people
react to it differently.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.008
You'll know by tonight.

15:04.687 --> 15:06.245
Tonight?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.626
Listen, um...

15:12.161 --> 15:14.254
...you don't mind my asking...

15:15.030 --> 15:17.396
...what is that contraption
you got over there?

15:17.566 --> 15:21.161
It's a siphon. Makes coffee.

15:22.471 --> 15:23.870
What else does it do?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.240
What else does it have to do?

15:34.817 --> 15:38.844
Did you know that coffee was originally
discovered by a shepherd in Ethiopia?

15:39.588 --> 15:41.488
- You don't say.
- It's true.

15:42.057 --> 15:45.356
Seems his goats were eating berries
from an unfamiliar bush.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.189
Before long, they were running
and jumping all over...

15:48.364 --> 15:49.729
...having a gay old time.

15:50.232 --> 15:53.895
So the shepherd took some of
the branches to the local monastery...

15:54.069 --> 15:56.663
...where the abbots decided
to roast them.

15:57.506 --> 15:58.939
When the berries burned...

15:59.108 --> 16:02.236
...the beans inside gave off
such a pleasant aroma...

16:02.411 --> 16:04.311
...they brewed them into a stew.

16:06.348 --> 16:08.077
Stew, huh?

16:08.250 --> 16:13.347
And over the next few hundred years,
it spread to Arabia, Europe...

16:13.822 --> 16:16.723
...even Sumatra,
like that hooch you got over there.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.258
It's called Kopi Luwak.

16:20.829 --> 16:22.626
I know what it's called.

16:23.032 --> 16:24.863
You do?

16:26.101 --> 16:28.194
Never catch me drinking that shit.

16:28.604 --> 16:30.538
Have you ever tried it?

16:31.206 --> 16:35.438
No. I'm more of a instant-coffee man.

16:35.611 --> 16:37.738
Here, here we are.

16:38.947 --> 16:42.041
- Thanks.
- No problem.

16:45.054 --> 16:46.612
There you are.

16:48.290 --> 16:51.054
You always had those freckles?

16:52.594 --> 16:54.289
Far as I know.

16:55.364 --> 16:56.797
Nice...

16:56.965 --> 16:58.592
...freckles.

16:59.935 --> 17:00.993
Hmm.

17:03.972 --> 17:08.271
Okay, we got prosciutto
and melons, some burrata mozzarella...

17:08.477 --> 17:10.444
...and a veal paillard.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.604
The folks at Toscana send their best.

17:15.017 --> 17:16.575
You sure you wanna eat all that?

17:17.786 --> 17:19.481
That's the plan.

17:22.023 --> 17:23.491
What?

17:25.027 --> 17:26.756
Oh, Uh...

17:27.396 --> 17:29.455
You want Thomas
to make you a plate?

17:29.631 --> 17:32.759
Tommy, uh, fix a plate for, uh...

17:33.402 --> 17:34.494
Carter.

17:35.270 --> 17:36.999
First name or last?

17:37.272 --> 17:38.330
First.

17:39.441 --> 17:41.705
Really? Interesting.

17:42.678 --> 17:46.546
So you want, uh...?
Might cheer you up.

17:46.782 --> 17:48.511
No, thanks, I'll pass.

17:49.118 --> 17:50.847
You sure?

17:53.722 --> 17:55.553
Mm, yum, yum.

17:55.791 --> 17:57.520
Mm-mm.

17:58.227 --> 18:00.218
Best in L.A.

18:06.635 --> 18:09.331
It ain't the best in L.A. no more.

18:40.602 --> 18:42.069
Oh, man.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.207
Maya made the honor roll again.

18:50.345 --> 18:52.210
Bet your ass she did.

18:59.855 --> 19:01.550
My God.

19:03.725 --> 19:07.684
Somewhere, some lucky guy's
having a heart attack.

19:20.943 --> 19:22.240
Fellas.

19:22.778 --> 19:24.405
Mr. Cole.

19:24.613 --> 19:29.744
Don't pay any attention
to me. I'm just, uh, talking to myself.

19:31.053 --> 19:32.543
It's from Kai.

19:33.822 --> 19:37.121
Says he wants to be a mechanic
like his granddad when he grows up.

19:37.292 --> 19:38.987
I hope you talked him out of that.

19:39.161 --> 19:40.753
Well, I tried.

19:42.030 --> 19:43.292
What do we got here?

19:43.732 --> 19:45.893
It's a Shelby 350.

19:48.637 --> 19:51.231
- I always wanted one of those.
- Yeah.

19:51.406 --> 19:53.465
- Kai remembered.
- Hmm.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.408
Um...

19:58.814 --> 20:01.647
Mom seems to think
you're not getting enough rest.

20:02.751 --> 20:04.048
Mm-hm.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.688
She loves you, Pop.

20:09.691 --> 20:10.919
Mm-hm.

20:16.164 --> 20:17.654
Okay.

20:19.067 --> 20:22.798
You'll, uh, call us when you get
your test results, huh?

20:22.971 --> 20:24.268
Mm-hm.

20:24.606 --> 20:26.437
If that day ever comes.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.602
Okay.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.145
- Take care.
- Okay.

20:42.024 --> 20:43.821
He your oldest?

20:43.992 --> 20:45.323
Yeah.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.223
What's he do?

20:47.963 --> 20:51.228
- Roger's a tax attorney.
- Oh.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.157
Here.

20:54.469 --> 20:56.528
His brother, Lee, is an engineer.

21:03.545 --> 21:05.479
Who's the pretty little lady?

21:05.681 --> 21:08.809
That's Rachel. Youngest of the three.

21:09.151 --> 21:10.516
Big age difference.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.314
Yeah, well, she was a surprise.

21:13.488 --> 21:16.980
We'd hardly gotten the boys out
of the house when she came along.

21:18.126 --> 21:20.492
She's an outstanding violinist.

21:23.398 --> 21:25.059
You got kids?

21:27.235 --> 21:28.998
Depends.

21:30.439 --> 21:33.772
- Never stayed married long enough.
- Oh, well...

21:34.009 --> 21:39.208
...don't worry, I've been married
long enough for the both of us.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.239
How's that going?

21:43.518 --> 21:45.076
It's going.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.787
That good, huh?

21:48.857 --> 21:51.724
Well, that's why they invented
light switches.

21:54.730 --> 21:59.793
Don't get me wrong, I loved
being married, been there four times.

21:59.968 --> 22:03.233
Problem is I love being single too.

22:04.272 --> 22:07.264
Hard to do them both
at the same time.

22:08.243 --> 22:11.576
Well, nobody's perfect.

22:11.780 --> 22:15.238
Only successful marriage I had
was me and my work.

22:15.617 --> 22:19.713
I started making money
when I was 16...

22:20.389 --> 22:22.448
...and that was that.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.385
Never stopped.

22:24.793 --> 22:26.488
I'll be damned.

22:28.697 --> 22:31.063
I wanted to be a history professor.

22:31.299 --> 22:32.766
Nobody's perfect.

22:35.303 --> 22:37.897
I made it through two months
of City College...

22:38.073 --> 22:40.735
...before Virginia gave me the news.

22:41.309 --> 22:43.277
And then, you know...

22:44.446 --> 22:49.509
...young, black, broke,
baby on the way...

22:51.319 --> 22:54.288
Take the first decent job
that comes along.

22:57.359 --> 22:59.452
I always meant to go back...

23:00.128 --> 23:03.461
...but 45 years goes by pretty fast.

23:04.933 --> 23:07.663
Like smoke through a keyhole.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.251
Shit!

23:42.771 --> 23:48.073
Don't give me the morphine
while I'm sleeping. It's a waste.

23:48.810 --> 23:52.576
Maybe she's trying to kill us both.
You ever think of that?

23:52.781 --> 23:54.214
Gin.

23:55.884 --> 23:57.784
What are you, the devil?

23:58.153 --> 24:00.849
What if I lost my mind already?

24:01.823 --> 24:03.484
Jesus, no.

24:03.658 --> 24:07.822
No. No, no Jesus,
this is not praying.

24:08.230 --> 24:11.256
I'm talking to myself
out loud, that's...

24:11.433 --> 24:14.163
<i>You ever think about suicide?</i>

24:14.336 --> 24:16.236
Suicide? Me?
- Yeah.

24:16.404 --> 24:18.065
Lord, no.

24:18.240 --> 24:21.300
Thought so. Stage one.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.344
What?

24:23.678 --> 24:26.374
The five stages, but...

24:26.548 --> 24:27.606
Denial.

24:27.849 --> 24:31.683
Then anger, bargaining,
depression, acceptance.

24:31.853 --> 24:35.949
So of course you're not
thinking of suicide.

24:36.324 --> 24:39.384
You're in stage one. Denial.

24:40.262 --> 24:42.093
What stage are you in?

24:43.465 --> 24:44.727
Denial.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.458
And thinking about suicide.

24:46.635 --> 24:48.728
Yeah, okay. It's just a frame of...

24:48.904 --> 24:51.566
Well, it looks like you won't be
needing this anymore.

24:51.773 --> 24:54.207
- That's it?
- Yep, fourth and final.

24:54.709 --> 24:55.733
What's next?

24:55.911 --> 24:58.709
They have to run all the tests first,
see where we stand.

24:59.047 --> 25:01.242
- Well, how long?
- Takes a while.

25:01.449 --> 25:03.781
I'll get Dr. Gibian to schedule them
when I see him.

25:03.952 --> 25:04.976
Thanks.

25:05.153 --> 25:07.212
I'm on for another hour,
anything you need?

25:08.123 --> 25:10.216
Clean bill of health if you got one.

25:10.559 --> 25:11.890
Hang in there, Carter.

25:13.061 --> 25:14.221
That's what I do.

25:18.967 --> 25:21.299
<i>And line to center, base hit...</i>

25:21.469 --> 25:24.336
<i>... Kent will have to play it
on three bounces...</i>

25:24.506 --> 25:27.270
<i>... and Alou will score.
The throw goes to the back...</i>

25:27.442 --> 25:31.742
Hit the cutoff man,
for crying out loud.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.604
You see...

25:33.982 --> 25:37.247
...that's the problem
with the game today:

25:37.419 --> 25:39.819
No fundamentals.

25:39.988 --> 25:42.115
<i>Did you ever read
The Time of Your Life?</i>

25:42.591 --> 25:44.923
- William Saroyan.
- Yeah.

25:45.126 --> 25:49.153
"No foundation.
All the way down the line."

25:49.331 --> 25:51.697
When we were growing up...
What are you doing?

25:52.701 --> 25:54.293
Nothing, scribbling.

25:55.503 --> 25:57.494
Scribbling? What?

25:58.006 --> 26:00.270
Nothing. Just scribbling.

26:03.278 --> 26:06.839
Oh, sure,
that's what you wanna do...

26:07.048 --> 26:11.109
...bounce a slider with a man on third.

26:11.453 --> 26:14.354
These kids today, they...

26:16.524 --> 26:21.223
Earphones.
I'm talking to myself, again.

26:26.534 --> 26:28.331
- Edward?
- Doc.

26:28.637 --> 26:29.934
How's it going there?

26:30.305 --> 26:32.239
Dumb question.

26:35.477 --> 26:37.138
I got the test back.

26:38.246 --> 26:39.941
I'll just lay it out, huh?

26:42.217 --> 26:43.479
Six months.

26:44.719 --> 26:46.687
A year if we're lucky.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.886
There is an experimental program
that we've been conducting...

26:51.059 --> 26:53.050
...and I don't wanna
get your hopes up...

26:53.228 --> 26:55.753
...but I think you would be
an excellent candidate...

26:55.964 --> 26:57.192
Hey, doc.

26:58.667 --> 26:59.964
Yes?

27:00.869 --> 27:03.201
You're blocking my view.

27:06.007 --> 27:07.031
Oh.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.607
Sorry.

27:11.112 --> 27:12.773
Anyway, if there's any questions...

27:13.014 --> 27:15.380
...day or night,
you know where to find me.

27:16.351 --> 27:17.909
One question.

27:18.353 --> 27:19.877
Sure, of course.

27:21.423 --> 27:25.018
Carter, you wanna
ask Dr. Hollins something?

27:25.226 --> 27:28.059
I mean, I'm not familiar
with Mr. Chambers'...

27:28.263 --> 27:30.561
Well, get familiar.

27:34.636 --> 27:35.728
Uh...

27:35.904 --> 27:38.930
I just wanted to know how I stand,
that's all.

27:39.441 --> 27:43.138
Sure. How about I'll go take a look
at your chart, okay?

27:43.912 --> 27:45.436
Thank you.

28:01.963 --> 28:03.396
Edward?

28:10.772 --> 28:12.262
Edward?

28:21.549 --> 28:23.608
<i>There was a survey once.</i>

28:24.185 --> 28:27.348
<i>A thousand people were asked,
if they could know in advance...</i>

28:27.555 --> 28:30.683
<i>... would they want to know
the exact day of their death.</i>

28:30.859 --> 28:33.953
<i>Ninety-six percent of them said no.</i>

28:35.997 --> 28:38.693
<i>I always kind of leaned toward
the other 4 percent.</i>

28:39.868 --> 28:42.428
<i>I thought it would be liberating...</i>

28:42.604 --> 28:45.698
<i>... knowing how much time
you had left to work with.</i>

28:45.874 --> 28:47.205
A year at best.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.775
<i>It turns out, it's not.</i>

28:49.944 --> 28:52.139
We're pretty much out of options.

29:18.039 --> 29:20.007
You want to play cards?

29:21.476 --> 29:23.967
Thought you'd never ask.

29:34.255 --> 29:36.120
Rise and shine.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.855
Or that.

29:52.006 --> 29:53.030
Let me see that.

29:56.644 --> 29:58.635
And, uh, Thomas...

29:58.847 --> 30:00.712
...call Marie at Christie's.

30:00.882 --> 30:04.579
Tell her I won't be bidding
this season.

30:05.453 --> 30:07.148
I understand.

30:07.789 --> 30:11.953
Uh, sir,
I don't mean to sound indelicate...

30:12.360 --> 30:15.921
...but how do you want me
to handle your?

30:16.731 --> 30:18.289
Death?

30:20.201 --> 30:22.192
Treat it as if it were your own.

30:23.271 --> 30:26.365
So leave all the money
to my assistant?

30:29.210 --> 30:32.737
Go get me one of those
almond croissants that I like.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.550
And don't buy any green bananas.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.427
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

30:58.106 --> 31:00.802
- Come on, give it back.
- What is it?

31:00.975 --> 31:02.408
Give it back.

31:03.711 --> 31:07.010
It was on the floor.
I didn't know it was a state secret.

31:10.919 --> 31:14.912
Well, my freshman
philosophy professor...

31:15.089 --> 31:18.581
...assigned this exercise
in forward thinking.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.352
He called it a "Bucket List."

31:20.962 --> 31:24.454
We were supposed to make a list
of things we wanted to do in our lives...

31:24.666 --> 31:26.657
...before we...
- Kicked the bucket.

31:26.834 --> 31:28.495
Cutesy.

31:28.670 --> 31:31.332
Anyway, I wrote things like
"make a million dollars"...

31:31.506 --> 31:35.806
..."first black president,"
you know, young man's wishes.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.878
I was gonna redo the list, but then...

31:39.113 --> 31:42.446
"Help a complete stranger
for the good."

31:43.551 --> 31:46.042
"Laugh until I cry."

31:46.688 --> 31:50.681
Not to be judgmental,
but this is extremely weak.

31:51.326 --> 31:54.352
Well, it's pointless now.

31:54.963 --> 31:59.127
I would argue the exact opposite.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.231
All right. That's it.

32:02.403 --> 32:03.461
What are you doing?

32:03.671 --> 32:06.071
A little rewrite, that's all.

32:06.474 --> 32:10.240
I mean, don't you want to go out
with some balls? Guns blazing?

32:10.411 --> 32:12.140
Have a little fun?

32:12.347 --> 32:15.976
It was not supposed to be about
guns blazing or anything like that.

32:16.150 --> 32:17.549
You're missing the point.

32:17.785 --> 32:21.312
What the hell is
"witness something majestic"?

32:22.557 --> 32:24.422
Have you ever been to the Himalayas?

32:25.827 --> 32:26.987
Eh.

32:27.161 --> 32:30.096
"Drive a Mustang Shelby." Not bad.

32:30.298 --> 32:35.395
I got one. All right.
How about skydiving?

32:36.904 --> 32:38.872
Now we're onto something.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.234
We're onto something?

32:40.408 --> 32:43.809
- Uh-huh.
- Let me see that. Come on.

32:45.246 --> 32:46.736
Fine.

32:53.454 --> 32:55.752
"Kiss the most beautiful girl
in the world"?

32:55.923 --> 32:57.447
How do you propose doing that?

32:58.126 --> 32:59.218
Volume.

33:03.831 --> 33:07.824
"Get a tattoo."
Is that the sum of your ambition?

33:08.870 --> 33:11.134
Edward, I've taken baths
deeper than you.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.767
It's easy to be deep
in freshman philosophy.

33:15.943 --> 33:17.877
What's Dr. Hollins say?

33:18.079 --> 33:20.309
We got months, right?

33:20.481 --> 33:21.778
A year, maybe.

33:21.983 --> 33:24.918
You think 45 years went by fast?

33:27.055 --> 33:28.852
We could do this.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.148
We should do this.

33:31.392 --> 33:32.416
No, I couldn't.

33:32.593 --> 33:36.393
Don't think about money.
That's all I got is money.

33:36.564 --> 33:37.792
But I don't know. l...

33:37.999 --> 33:39.261
What don't you know?

33:39.634 --> 33:41.966
It was meant to be metaphorical.

33:42.136 --> 33:45.162
- I'm just trying to get a handle on...
- Blah, blah, blah.

33:45.373 --> 33:46.499
Metaphors.

33:46.741 --> 33:50.609
You're the one crying you never
took a shot. Here's your chance.

33:50.812 --> 33:53.576
My chance to what?
Make a fool of myself?

33:54.582 --> 33:55.981
Never too late.

33:59.987 --> 34:02.421
What do you think happens now?

34:02.590 --> 34:05.184
I go back and sit around
listening to people...

34:05.393 --> 34:09.489
...talking about mezzanine financing
and subordinated debt...

34:09.697 --> 34:12.530
...pretending that I care
about dead money.

34:12.934 --> 34:16.630
You go home to some
ceremonial procession into death...

34:16.838 --> 34:19.773
...with everyone standing around
watching you die...

34:19.940 --> 34:21.533
...while you try to comfort them.

34:22.210 --> 34:26.806
Is that what you want,
to be smothered by pity and grief?

34:27.148 --> 34:28.775
Well, not me.

34:29.449 --> 34:34.649
And in your heart, Carter,
I believe not you either.

34:37.925 --> 34:41.656
We're both in the same boat.
How's that for a metaphor?

34:43.231 --> 34:46.563
We got a real opportunity here.

34:46.868 --> 34:48.529
Opportunity?

34:48.703 --> 34:51.831
That is real twisted,
even by your standards.

34:52.039 --> 34:56.476
We still feel good, right?
Energy's coming back a little bit.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.168
Asymptomatic, the doc says.

34:59.647 --> 35:02.514
The way I see it,
we can lay around here...

35:02.683 --> 35:06.551
...hoping for a miracle in
some bullshit science experiment...

35:06.721 --> 35:11.488
...or we can put some moves on.

35:21.335 --> 35:22.859
Skydiving, huh?

35:23.905 --> 35:25.202
All right.

35:27.842 --> 35:31.403
What kind of hospital is this?
There isn't an M.D. within a mile.

35:33.014 --> 35:35.574
Virginia, we have to talk.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.376
What did they say?

35:37.552 --> 35:43.115
Uh, Mrs. Chambers, I'm gonna
give you two a little quiet time.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.781
Excuse me.

35:56.204 --> 35:57.501
It's not good.

36:03.444 --> 36:05.912
I knew we should have gone to UCLA.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.241
The surgeons are better.
Post-op is better.

36:08.449 --> 36:10.610
- Wouldn't have mattered.
- You don't know that.

36:10.818 --> 36:13.582
We're not giving up.
I want another opinion.

36:13.754 --> 36:15.153
Ah, Virginia.

36:15.389 --> 36:17.653
Yes, Oncology, please.
Dr. Veteri's office.

36:17.892 --> 36:19.792
Virginia, no.

36:20.127 --> 36:21.788
Let me handle this.

36:24.398 --> 36:27.162
Dr. Veteri? Virginia Chambers.

36:27.335 --> 36:29.166
Yes, that's right...

36:43.451 --> 36:45.419
I'm going away for a while.

36:46.420 --> 36:48.115
What are you talking about?

36:48.322 --> 36:51.086
I'm talking about Edward and I
are going away.

36:51.359 --> 36:53.327
Edward and you?

36:53.828 --> 36:56.126
Going away where?

36:57.932 --> 36:59.866
I don't expect you to understand.

37:00.334 --> 37:03.497
You're damn right I don't understand.

37:03.671 --> 37:06.799
I don't understand how you can
just give up like this.

37:06.974 --> 37:09.568
How you can just quit...
Quit fighting.

37:09.777 --> 37:12.211
- Virginia.
- Why don't you tell our children that?

37:12.446 --> 37:15.847
See what they say when they find out
you've given up on them.

37:16.083 --> 37:17.846
Given up on them?

37:18.653 --> 37:20.644
Given up on them?

37:21.389 --> 37:24.358
I've got 45 years greased up
under the hood of a car...

37:24.525 --> 37:28.188
...so that they didn't want for anything,
and they didn't.

37:28.362 --> 37:30.660
I think I've earned some time
for myself.

37:30.865 --> 37:34.631
To do what?
Run off with a total stranger?

37:34.835 --> 37:36.166
He's not a stranger.

37:36.370 --> 37:37.735
I'm your wife.

37:37.972 --> 37:40.236
And I'm your husband.
And I'm their father.

37:40.408 --> 37:43.036
And I'm a grandfather.
And I'm a damn mechanic!

37:43.244 --> 37:44.404
And you're a fool.

37:44.912 --> 37:49.042
You're a fool who thinks he's figured out
a way how not to have cancer.

37:54.989 --> 37:56.684
I'm sorry.

38:07.335 --> 38:09.860
My husband is not for sale.

38:23.684 --> 38:25.652
She hates me.

38:30.658 --> 38:32.523
Do you hate me?

38:34.729 --> 38:36.287
Not yet.

38:40.701 --> 38:42.532
<i>And so it began.</i>

38:58.919 --> 39:01.387
I've always been afraid to go up
in an airplane...

39:01.589 --> 39:05.184
...now I'm gonna jump out of one
at the whim of a maniac!

39:07.194 --> 39:08.559
Wanna get it?

39:09.230 --> 39:11.596
How do you suggest we do that?

39:11.999 --> 39:13.057
Wait.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.392
Ow!

39:20.007 --> 39:21.099
Aah!

39:21.275 --> 39:22.742
Damn it.

39:28.349 --> 39:30.078
Not a word.

39:31.852 --> 39:33.945
Back to the seat, Kyle.

39:34.155 --> 39:38.922
You'll have to forgive him, Kyle.
He's worried about the little woman.

39:39.126 --> 39:41.617
This has nothing to do with my wife.

39:41.829 --> 39:43.228
Thirty seconds to drop.

39:43.431 --> 39:45.661
The Sequel was like that.

39:45.833 --> 39:48.358
She never backed me up on anything.

39:48.602 --> 39:49.728
The Sequel?

39:49.937 --> 39:52.303
The second Mrs. Edward Cole.

39:53.307 --> 39:55.775
God, that woman hated me.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.137
Maybe because you called her
The Sequel.

39:58.779 --> 40:02.943
Jeez, Kyle,
I never looked at it that way.

40:03.117 --> 40:04.982
- Fifteen seconds.
- No, no.

40:05.186 --> 40:07.780
- Wait! Wait, I can't do this.
- Sure you can.

40:07.988 --> 40:10.388
No. I can't. Really.

40:10.624 --> 40:12.489
It's not the jump you're afraid of.

40:12.693 --> 40:14.126
The hell it's not!

40:14.328 --> 40:16.660
You're just afraid
your chute won't open...

40:16.831 --> 40:21.291
...and you'll show up at
your own funeral as a Denver omelet.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.733
No, I'm pretty much just worried
the chute won't open.

40:24.905 --> 40:26.065
No, no!

40:30.044 --> 40:32.569
Man's got some lungs, huh?

40:33.147 --> 40:35.377
Let's hit the silk!

40:35.916 --> 40:39.317
Geronimo!

40:39.487 --> 40:44.015
Oh, yeah, beautiful!

40:46.527 --> 40:48.688
Aah! Aah!

40:48.863 --> 40:51.263
Pull the thing! Pull the cord!

40:51.432 --> 40:54.833
How about this, huh? This is living.

40:55.035 --> 40:57.868
I hate your rotten guts.

40:58.072 --> 41:00.666
Surrender to the void!

41:01.008 --> 41:03.238
Which one of these damn cords
do you pull?

41:03.444 --> 41:06.743
Don't touch it. We're not in the
drop zone yet. We could wind up in the...

41:08.816 --> 41:11.250
Okay. Let's deploy.

41:11.585 --> 41:15.544
<i>I got a feeling I'm falling</i>

41:15.890 --> 41:18.017
We're in the red zone. Pull the cord.

41:18.192 --> 41:21.855
<i>I got a feeling I'm falling in love</i>

41:22.029 --> 41:24.327
Pull the damn cord!

41:25.633 --> 41:27.624
I was in love once.

41:33.040 --> 41:36.476
Tommy, we live to die another day.

41:36.710 --> 41:38.302
How lucky for me.

41:38.479 --> 41:42.779
No jokes, Thomas, remember the will.
You're so close.

41:44.285 --> 41:46.480
Let me ask you something.

41:46.654 --> 41:49.088
Uh, is it Tommy or Thomas?

41:49.256 --> 41:53.124
Um, it's actually Matthew,
but he finds that too biblical.

41:53.294 --> 41:56.491
Let's eat something. Come on!

41:56.664 --> 41:58.359
Is he insane?

41:58.766 --> 42:00.165
Depends.

42:03.470 --> 42:05.267
So you decided?

42:05.439 --> 42:09.432
No, I couldn't think of anything
I wanted to be stuck with permanently.

42:09.610 --> 42:13.068
What's permanently?
We're gonna be dead in five minutes.

42:13.247 --> 42:16.148
- What?
- Figure of speech.

42:16.317 --> 42:20.947
So no Confederate flag,
no black Jesus.

42:21.155 --> 42:22.747
No, I'm gonna...

42:22.957 --> 42:24.822
Pass. Yeah, sure.

42:25.025 --> 42:27.186
Well, I never agreed
to desecrate my body.

42:27.428 --> 42:29.988
You worried they won't bury you
in a Jewish cemetery?

42:30.698 --> 42:32.188
What, the wife?

42:32.399 --> 42:33.923
It's a tattoo.

42:34.134 --> 42:36.694
It's not like you're dumping her
for another woman.

42:37.438 --> 42:39.303
I never been with another woman.

42:39.907 --> 42:40.965
Whoa.

42:42.209 --> 42:44.541
That's gotta be on the list.

42:44.778 --> 42:46.541
No, no. I don't think so.

42:46.714 --> 42:49.012
Sixty-six years?

42:49.216 --> 42:52.617
Man, oh, man.
We ought to have a big orgy.

42:52.820 --> 42:53.912
No.

42:54.121 --> 42:55.952
Orgy's not even being unfaithful.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.282
No.

42:57.491 --> 43:00.483
It's just, like, professional.

43:00.694 --> 43:01.820
No!

43:02.162 --> 43:04.221
I don't even have to be there.

43:09.536 --> 43:11.527
Hello, darling.

43:13.474 --> 43:16.500
- You gonna drive it or buy it a dress?
- Ha, ha.

43:16.844 --> 43:19.472
Just getting to know each other.

43:28.522 --> 43:30.752
You sure we're cleared for this?

43:30.991 --> 43:34.893
Of course we're cleared for it.
What if we weren't?

43:35.062 --> 43:36.689
Just checking.

43:57.217 --> 44:01.483
Come on! Tap it, baby!
Let's see what she's got.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.789
Ah, we're doing just fine.

44:04.024 --> 44:08.256
You sound like some kid
going to the junior prom.

44:09.530 --> 44:12.226
You sound like someone looking
for an ass-whupping.

44:12.700 --> 44:15.362
Ass-whupping? Ho-ho-ho-ho.

44:15.536 --> 44:17.527
- You got nothing!
- Ha, ha.

44:17.905 --> 44:21.363
Got enough for you, Sunny Jim,
dangling.

44:32.286 --> 44:34.754
Did you just make a penis reference?

44:35.322 --> 44:37.153
What if I did?

44:38.559 --> 44:41.221
Jesus! You're gonna kill us both!

44:41.428 --> 44:42.622
What if I do?

44:44.431 --> 44:45.921
Goddamn it!

44:47.968 --> 44:49.663
You're breaking evil on me.

44:49.903 --> 44:52.303
Evil? I'll show you evil.

44:52.539 --> 44:54.803
I'll show you Evel goddamn Knievel.

44:54.975 --> 44:57.535
Pick up on this, chicken man!

45:03.183 --> 45:05.413
Yee-ha!

45:11.759 --> 45:13.920
Chicken man, huh?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.696
You can run, but you cannot hide!

45:51.732 --> 45:53.495
What do you wanna do next?

45:58.639 --> 46:00.539
<i>How much money do you have anyway?</i>

46:00.707 --> 46:02.504
<i>Didn't anyone ever tell you...</i>

46:02.676 --> 46:05.509
<i>... that it's rude
to talk about someone else's money?</i>

46:05.679 --> 46:08.705
<i>I never knew anyone with enough to ask.</i>

47:08.742 --> 47:09.766
Medicinal.

47:24.191 --> 47:26.887
It's indescribably beautiful.

47:27.928 --> 47:30.920
I love flying over the polar cap.

47:31.632 --> 47:33.725
Above the desolation.

47:34.234 --> 47:36.134
The stars...

47:37.271 --> 47:40.240
...it's really one of God's good ones.

47:43.477 --> 47:48.847
So you think a being
of some sort did all this?

47:49.783 --> 47:51.216
You don't?

47:51.418 --> 47:55.411
You mean, do I believe
if I look up in the sky...

47:55.589 --> 47:57.921
...and promise this or that...

47:58.091 --> 48:01.959
...the Biggie will make all this
go away?

48:02.596 --> 48:03.620
No.

48:04.097 --> 48:06.964
Then 95 percent of the people on Earth
are wrong?

48:07.167 --> 48:09.135
If life has taught me anything...

48:09.303 --> 48:12.534
...it's that 95 percent of the people
are always wrong.

48:12.773 --> 48:14.331
It's called faith.

48:15.275 --> 48:20.110
I honestly envy people who have faith.
I just can't get my head around it.

48:20.547 --> 48:22.742
Maybe your head's in the way.

48:25.118 --> 48:28.815
Carter, we've all had hundreds
of these discussions...

48:28.989 --> 48:32.857
...and every one of them
always hits the same wall.

48:33.026 --> 48:37.895
Is there a sugarplum fairy or not?

48:38.065 --> 48:41.831
And nobody has ever gotten
over that wall.

48:42.369 --> 48:45.304
So, what do you believe?

48:47.174 --> 48:49.904
I resist all beliefs.

48:50.210 --> 48:53.907
No big bang? Random universe?

48:54.081 --> 48:55.309
We live.

48:55.515 --> 48:56.982
We die.

48:57.150 --> 49:00.677
And the wheels on the bus
go round and round.

49:03.056 --> 49:06.025
What if you're wrong?

49:07.227 --> 49:09.354
I'd love to be wrong.

49:09.529 --> 49:13.090
If I'm wrong, I win.

49:16.303 --> 49:18.931
I'm not sure it works that way.

49:20.741 --> 49:24.268
Well, you're not claiming you know
something I don't.

49:24.444 --> 49:25.843
Mm-mm.

49:26.513 --> 49:28.538
I just have faith.

49:32.119 --> 49:34.451
Hallelujah, brother...

49:34.621 --> 49:36.555
...and pass the mustard.

49:51.605 --> 49:54.233
<i>Know how they harvest caviar?
- Hit me.</i>

49:54.441 --> 49:56.773
When a female sturgeon is caught...

49:56.977 --> 50:00.378
...the fisherman has to take great care
to see she dies peacefully.

50:00.547 --> 50:03.243
- Mm-hm.
- If she feels the least bit threatened...

50:03.450 --> 50:05.918
...she secretes a sour chemical
that ruins the eggs.

50:06.086 --> 50:07.917
Sounds like my third wife.

50:09.856 --> 50:13.257
Woman thought mayonnaise
came from a plant.

50:16.129 --> 50:17.858
I could get used to this.

50:18.065 --> 50:20.363
Also sounds like my third wife.

50:26.173 --> 50:28.869
Thirty years I've been coming here.

50:29.876 --> 50:32.174
First time with a guy.

50:32.412 --> 50:33.777
Well, I'm flattered.

50:34.748 --> 50:37.478
Emily's 10th birthday
was the best, though.

50:38.185 --> 50:39.482
Who's Emily?

50:39.820 --> 50:41.481
My little, uh...

50:43.523 --> 50:46.151
Well, she's not so little anymore.

50:47.294 --> 50:48.625
You have a daughter?

50:48.829 --> 50:52.162
- But I thought you said...
- Yeah, well...

50:52.332 --> 50:54.698
...I didn't know you then.

50:59.272 --> 51:02.298
Make a long story short, uh...

51:02.976 --> 51:04.841
...I don't see her.

51:06.813 --> 51:08.110
Hmm.

51:14.121 --> 51:15.179
What are you doing?

51:15.689 --> 51:17.520
It's time.

51:18.525 --> 51:21.050
- No, no, no. Cross that off.
- Why not?

51:21.294 --> 51:23.285
- Cross it off.
- Why?

51:23.497 --> 51:24.794
Why?

51:24.998 --> 51:27.023
There is no why.

51:33.306 --> 51:35.297
- What's the matter?
- Excuse me.

51:35.675 --> 51:36.937
Where you going?

51:40.714 --> 51:42.648
Just like a broad.

51:50.056 --> 51:52.684
Look, uh, Carter...

51:53.693 --> 51:56.025
I'm sorry. I know...

51:56.897 --> 51:59.730
...sometimes I get
a little overbearing and l...

52:02.536 --> 52:04.231
Jesus Christ.

52:04.404 --> 52:06.531
- It's all right. It's okay.
- What? What?

52:06.706 --> 52:09.072
The top on the catheter came loose,
that's all.

52:09.242 --> 52:11.836
Well, maybe we should get you
to a hospital, Carter...

52:12.012 --> 52:13.946
- I just busted out of the hospital.
- Huh?

52:14.114 --> 52:17.777
It's all right. Look, it's already stopped,
see? Let's get out of here.

52:18.018 --> 52:20.612
It looks wonderful.
Uh... Uh...

52:20.787 --> 52:22.584
- Maybe I'll get the...
- Let's just go.

52:22.756 --> 52:25.247
- You go straight to the car.
- Come on. Come on.

52:25.425 --> 52:26.892
Okay, all right.

52:37.604 --> 52:40.869
- Where's...? Where's Tommy?
- In the salon, monsieur.

52:44.377 --> 52:46.106
Oh, my.

52:47.147 --> 52:49.274
How much money do you have?

52:50.550 --> 52:52.745
Well, I wouldn't bleed on the rugs.

52:55.922 --> 53:00.382
I'm gonna find someplace
where I can take a nice hot bath.

53:00.560 --> 53:01.993
Be as good as new afterwards.

53:02.395 --> 53:04.260
Uh... You... Okay.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.797
- Tom...
- Okay, we're all set, then? Okay, good.

53:06.967 --> 53:09.993
All right, it took some doing,
but, uh, I rearranged everything.

53:10.170 --> 53:14.300
Cairo tomorrow, Tanzania for two days,
then Johannesburg on Saturday.

53:14.474 --> 53:19.468
And, as previously directed,
no bullfight, no tiger hunt.

53:20.313 --> 53:25.273
Thomas, I'd really like to say
you're irreplaceable...

53:25.452 --> 53:27.317
...but I'd be lying.

53:28.054 --> 53:32.491
And I'd really like to say you're
a gracious man, and I love my job...

53:32.659 --> 53:35.355
...but I, too, would be lying.

53:35.829 --> 53:38.127
Turnabout is fair play.

53:38.298 --> 53:41.426
I believe you learned that
from the master.

53:41.801 --> 53:45.703
<i>Hey, look!
They got Jeopardy! in the bathroom!</i>

53:46.606 --> 53:48.972
<i>On the TV. Jeopardy!</i>

53:50.377 --> 53:52.868
<i>Jeopardy!? In French?</i>

53:53.780 --> 53:54.872
Hello?

53:55.448 --> 53:58.781
Mr. Cole? Virginia Chambers.

53:59.953 --> 54:03.684
Oh. Yeah. Um, hi.

54:04.724 --> 54:06.214
Let me get Carter for you.

54:06.459 --> 54:08.450
Well, actually,
I called to speak to you.

54:08.962 --> 54:10.020
Oh.

54:10.997 --> 54:13.693
Is he all right?

54:16.036 --> 54:19.164
Oh, yeah. He's... He's fine.

54:20.707 --> 54:22.197
May I ask where you are?

54:22.809 --> 54:25.676
France, actually. Uh, tomorrow...

54:25.879 --> 54:27.608
Give him back to me.

54:29.482 --> 54:32.610
Virginia. May I call you Virginia?

54:33.687 --> 54:35.746
I'm not sure that I can make...

54:35.922 --> 54:37.822
<i>I'm not asking for his sake.</i>

54:38.325 --> 54:39.849
Mr. Cole...

54:40.827 --> 54:44.319
...l've been a nurse
my entire adult life.

54:44.497 --> 54:47.557
Had a ringside seat
to more human tragedy...

54:47.734 --> 54:50.601
...than any woman should ever
have to bear.

54:50.770 --> 54:54.228
Now, I'm prepared
for my husband to die.

54:55.041 --> 54:58.943
I'm just not prepared to lose him
while he's still alive.

55:02.349 --> 55:04.408
<i>- Who is Howdy Doody?
- You got it.</i>

55:04.651 --> 55:06.744
<i>- You pick.
- "TV Puppets," for 400.</i>

55:06.920 --> 55:08.217
<i>These two Muppets...</i>

55:08.388 --> 55:10.686
<i>... are roommates on
the long-running show Sesame Street.</i>

55:10.857 --> 55:13.018
<i>- Who are Bert and Ernie?
- Who are Bert and Ernie?</i>

55:15.862 --> 55:18.057
<i>- the son of a Greek immigrant...</i>

55:18.231 --> 55:19.562
<i>... was born in Towson, Maryland.</i>

55:19.733 --> 55:21.701
Who is Spiro Agnew?

55:21.868 --> 55:24.132
<i>Who is Spiro Agnew?</i>

55:24.304 --> 55:25.362
Well...

55:25.672 --> 55:28.106
...you're looking, uh...

55:28.274 --> 55:29.935
...buoyant.

55:30.577 --> 55:33.478
This is the first time I was ever in a tub
with no corners.

55:33.713 --> 55:35.112
Really?

55:36.116 --> 55:40.314
You know, ahem, Carter,
uh, I've been thinking...

55:41.621 --> 55:44.886
...what with the catheter
and everything...

55:45.925 --> 55:48.257
...maybe we should put this on hold
for a while.

55:48.695 --> 55:51.994
Come on, now, I told you,
stop worrying. I'm fine.

55:52.198 --> 55:54.689
No, no, it's not that. It's not that.

55:54.901 --> 55:58.064
It's just, I mean, if you're worried
about letting me down...

55:58.238 --> 56:00.331
...you know, it's a lot easier for me.

56:02.142 --> 56:04.337
You talked to Virginia, didn't you?

56:08.715 --> 56:10.410
Why do you think I'm doing this?

56:11.017 --> 56:13.110
Because I talked you into it.

56:14.087 --> 56:17.989
Edward, you're strong,
but you're not that strong.

56:21.761 --> 56:23.126
No.

56:24.597 --> 56:29.091
After Rachel left for college,
there was a hole.

56:30.303 --> 56:34.672
I mean, you know, no more homework,
no more Little League...

56:35.375 --> 56:38.276
...recitals, school plays...

56:39.512 --> 56:43.346
...kids crying, fights, skinned knees.

56:46.286 --> 56:49.619
And for the first time in 40 years,
I looked at Virginia...

56:49.789 --> 56:56.126
...without all of the noise,
without all of the distractions...

56:56.796 --> 57:00.391
...and I couldn't remember
what it felt like...

57:00.633 --> 57:05.127
...when I could not walk down the street
without holding her hand.

57:11.644 --> 57:17.139
I mean, she was the same woman
I fell in love with, she hadn't changed.

57:19.552 --> 57:23.579
But somehow
everything was different.

57:25.725 --> 57:28.319
We'd lost something along the way.

57:30.363 --> 57:31.830
You know?

57:32.365 --> 57:33.525
<i>"TV Puppets," for 600.</i>

57:33.700 --> 57:38.569
<i>Ventriloquist Edgar Bergen
hosted a show named for this dummy.</i>

57:39.239 --> 57:41.867
Who is Charlie McCarthy?

57:42.075 --> 57:44.543
<i>Sandy?
- Who's Charlie McCarthy?</i>

58:15.975 --> 58:17.237
Look, look, look!

58:20.046 --> 58:21.104
Aah!

58:25.451 --> 58:27.578
<i>I was very pleased
when Edward decided...</i>

58:27.754 --> 58:30.245
<i>... to eliminate item number nine
from his list:</i>

58:30.423 --> 58:32.482
<i>"Hunt the big cat."</i>

58:32.659 --> 58:35.822
<i>Of course, he did insist on discharging
a few rounds from the big gun.</i>

58:38.431 --> 58:40.365
<i>One proved to be enough.</i>

58:45.638 --> 58:48.869
- Gin.
- Of course, gin, why not?

58:56.616 --> 58:58.379
Do you know...

58:58.585 --> 59:02.578
...that the only dog ever struck
by lightning was right here, in Egypt?

59:04.023 --> 59:06.821
I wish I'd met you
before we were dead.

59:12.599 --> 59:15.466
You know, technically...

59:17.770 --> 59:20.603
...we could cross off two items:

59:20.773 --> 59:22.934
"See the pyramids"...

59:24.611 --> 59:26.636
...and "witness something majestic."

59:27.947 --> 59:31.110
This is about as majestic as it gets.

59:32.552 --> 59:34.213
Wait till you see my mountain.

59:34.721 --> 59:36.655
Oh, yeah.

59:38.458 --> 59:40.289
Your mountain.

59:41.561 --> 59:45.520
Still, this ain't half bad.

59:45.698 --> 59:49.828
You know, the ancient Egyptians had
a beautiful belief about death.

59:50.637 --> 59:52.969
When their souls got
to the entrance to heaven...

59:53.139 --> 59:55.630
...the gods asked them two questions.

59:55.808 --> 59:59.505
Their answers determined whether
they were admitted or not.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.081
Okay, I'll bite.

01:00:05.985 --> 01:00:07.885
What were they?

01:00:09.322 --> 01:00:11.984
Have you found joy in your life?

01:00:12.392 --> 01:00:13.689
Uh-huh.

01:00:17.563 --> 01:00:19.053
Answer the question.

01:00:19.399 --> 01:00:20.764
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:00:20.967 --> 01:00:24.403
Answer the question,
"Have I found joy in my life?"

01:00:27.907 --> 01:00:29.340
Yes.

01:00:29.842 --> 01:00:32.538
Has your life brought joy to others?

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:37.481
Ah, this type of question, l...

01:00:38.584 --> 01:00:40.575
I don't know, uh...

01:00:40.753 --> 01:00:44.120
I don't think about
how other people gauge, uh...

01:00:46.359 --> 01:00:47.519
Ask them.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:49.752
I'm asking you.

01:00:53.399 --> 01:00:54.798
Fine.

01:00:55.768 --> 01:00:57.292
Fine.

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.564
Let me put it to you this way.

01:01:04.043 --> 01:01:07.638
After the breakup,
and the ensuing fleecing of the dad...

01:01:07.814 --> 01:01:09.941
...Emily went to live with her mother.

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:15.444
You know, you try to stay close,
but it gets down to holidays...

01:01:15.655 --> 01:01:19.785
...phone calls, birthday cards,
you know.

01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:21.551
Anyway...

01:01:23.229 --> 01:01:27.325
...Emily goes to college, joins one
of her "Save the Poor People"...

01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:29.797
...the animals, whatnot...

01:01:29.969 --> 01:01:32.301
...meets a guy, decides she loves him.

01:01:33.039 --> 01:01:36.304
Good-looking kid, driven, smart.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.774
But there was something about him...

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:47.283
...so when she said they were engaged
I told her I was against it...

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:50.115
...but being my daughter, naturally...

01:01:50.923 --> 01:01:53.084
...she went ahead
and married him anyway.

01:01:53.259 --> 01:01:56.490
Needless to say,
I wasn't invited to the wedding.

01:01:57.563 --> 01:01:58.928
That must have hurt.

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.262
You think?

01:02:05.938 --> 01:02:11.001
First time he hit her, she came to me.
I wanted to bash his brains in.

01:02:11.611 --> 01:02:13.135
She wouldn't let me.

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:16.975
Said she loved him, said it wasn't
his fault, he'd had a few drinks...

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.085
...she was the one picked the fight.

01:02:22.288 --> 01:02:25.849
Next time it happened,
she didn't come to me.

01:02:27.026 --> 01:02:30.393
The ex told me.
Nice to hear her voice again.

01:02:31.898 --> 01:02:33.229
What did you do?

01:02:33.466 --> 01:02:35.593
What any father would do.

01:02:36.502 --> 01:02:38.629
I took care of it.

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:44.409
I called a guy who called a guy
who handles these kinds of things.

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:47.078
I don't know what he said,
don't know what he did...

01:02:47.246 --> 01:02:49.714
...all I know is he didn't kill him...

01:02:49.882 --> 01:02:53.978
...and my daughter never
heard from him again.

01:02:55.655 --> 01:02:57.623
How did she react?

01:02:59.425 --> 01:03:03.486
Called me names you wouldn't believe,
and worse...

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:06.994
Said I was dead to her.

01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:15.238
I'm not proud of everything I did...

01:03:15.408 --> 01:03:18.070
...but I'm pretty sure
I'd do it all again...

01:03:18.244 --> 01:03:22.772
...so if they don't let me into Egyptian
heaven because my daughter hates me...

01:03:22.949 --> 01:03:26.715
...well, then I guess that's
just the way it goes.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:29.753
However you answer
your two questions.

01:03:35.294 --> 01:03:38.161
How do we get down from this tomb?

01:03:57.183 --> 01:04:01.210
The empress was the wife
of Shah Jahan, the fifth Mogul emperor.

01:04:02.121 --> 01:04:05.386
Although it was an arranged marriage,
they were deeply in love...

01:04:05.558 --> 01:04:10.586
...and remained inseparable until
she died giving birth to their 14th child.

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:15.559
Do you mind if I call you Ray?

01:04:16.636 --> 01:04:18.934
Main man Ray.

01:04:19.138 --> 01:04:21.299
Are you listening
to anything I'm saying?

01:04:21.507 --> 01:04:23.134
Absolutely.

01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:26.506
Fourteen kids. I'm with you.

01:04:30.082 --> 01:04:35.213
It took 20,000 volunteers 22 years
to complete this structure.

01:04:35.421 --> 01:04:38.481
Every square foot designed
by the shah himself.

01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:41.919
So that's true love.

01:04:42.595 --> 01:04:44.460
That's true love.

01:04:45.765 --> 01:04:47.289
Must be nice.

01:04:54.674 --> 01:05:00.237
Don't know if I buy the whole
"20,000 volunteers" business.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:06.251
<i>Funeral plans tend to confuse me.</i>

01:05:06.953 --> 01:05:09.820
<i>Specifically, buried or cremated.</i>

01:05:10.523 --> 01:05:12.184
Take buried.

01:05:12.358 --> 01:05:15.452
Now, I know it shouldn't matter,
but I'm claustrophobic.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:20.826
What if I wake up underground
and nobody can hear me?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.060
Do they still make those coffins
with the bells?

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:27.967
Uh... I don't believe they do.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:32.038
Then cremated.
What do you do with the ashes?

01:05:32.211 --> 01:05:34.975
Do you bury them, scatter them,
put them on a shelf?

01:05:35.147 --> 01:05:39.049
Float them down the Ganges
on a bed of flowers?

01:05:39.652 --> 01:05:42.280
What if I feel the flames?

01:05:43.322 --> 01:05:46.223
Well, I definitely want
to have myself cremated.

01:05:46.392 --> 01:05:50.328
Maybe we should go frozen
like Walt Disney.

01:05:51.163 --> 01:05:53.597
No. Cremated.

01:05:53.799 --> 01:05:57.235
Ashes put in a can,
buried some place with a view.

01:05:57.403 --> 01:05:58.927
A can, huh?

01:05:59.105 --> 01:06:02.905
Yeah. I never liked the sound
of the word urn.

01:06:03.075 --> 01:06:08.012
Really? Got any special feelings
about crypt?

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.114
Heh. No.

01:06:10.316 --> 01:06:14.343
No, an old Chock Full o'Nuts can
will do me just fine.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.921
Chock Full o'Nuts,
"the Heavenly Coffee."

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:20.957
Better coffee even your money
can't buy, my friend.

01:06:21.127 --> 01:06:22.389
Don't bet on it.

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:24.358
Oh, right.

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:26.395
Kopi Luwak.

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:29.534
What do you got against Kopi Luwak?

01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:33.099
Too fancy for my tastes.

01:06:33.272 --> 01:06:38.471
Oh, yeah.
Too fancy for my main man, Ray.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:46.074
Gin.
- Goddamn it.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:47.947
You get all the cards.

01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:58.053
This is China for you, baby.

01:06:58.664 --> 01:07:01.497
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

01:07:18.984 --> 01:07:21.976
Be a lot more majestic
if we could see it.

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:25.988
See that old woman?

01:07:26.759 --> 01:07:29.887
Odds are we're gonna be
dead before her.

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.291
Happy thought.

01:07:34.834 --> 01:07:37.997
Of course, she's probably got
reincarnation going for her...

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:40.468
...however that system works.

01:07:40.673 --> 01:07:43.107
Ah, the Buddhists believe
you keep coming back.

01:07:43.275 --> 01:07:46.608
Moving up or down a level,
based on how you lived your life.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.637
See, that's where they lose me.

01:07:50.282 --> 01:07:54.946
I mean, what would a snail have to do
to move up in the lineup?

01:07:55.121 --> 01:07:58.113
Lay down a perfect trail of slime?

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:00.155
So shitty news, or really shitty news?

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.985
A, the first one.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:04.963
There's a storm up there.

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:08.861
Well, thanks for the bulletin, Tom,
we can't even see the goddamn thing.

01:08:09.034 --> 01:08:11.502
They won't let us fly up
until the weather clears.

01:08:11.704 --> 01:08:13.695
Well, when do they expect it to clear?

01:08:13.873 --> 01:08:15.841
Uh, next spring, sometime.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.745
That's the really shitty news,
in case you were wondering.

01:08:29.054 --> 01:08:31.886
Well, maybe next time.

01:08:32.558 --> 01:08:33.991
Yeah.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:36.725
Next spring.

01:08:39.265 --> 01:08:40.892
So now what?

01:08:41.066 --> 01:08:45.560
Well, maybe your mountain's
trying to tell us something.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.261
What do you mean?

01:08:47.506 --> 01:08:50.339
Maybe we've been gone long enough.

01:08:50.843 --> 01:08:54.040
Gone long enough?
Gone long enough for whom?

01:08:55.915 --> 01:08:58.008
Oh. No, I get it.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:01.743
The mountain isn't telling us
it's time for us to go home.

01:09:01.921 --> 01:09:06.858
The mountain is telling you to tell me
it's time for me to go home, right?

01:09:07.026 --> 01:09:10.051
- Yeah.
- You shit.

01:09:10.261 --> 01:09:13.890
Why don't you worry about your life,
and let me worry about mine, okay?

01:09:14.099 --> 01:09:16.430
Okay, okay! You don't have to
get chippy with me.

01:09:16.868 --> 01:09:20.737
What's next?
- Next, Hong Kong.

01:09:21.607 --> 01:09:25.064
<i>Silk suits and black walnut ice cream.</i>

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:32.874
Tibetans call it Chomulungma,
"Goddess Mother of the Snows."

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:36.718
"Goddess Mother of the World,"
actually.

01:09:37.523 --> 01:09:40.252
In the traditional Tibetan translation.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.024
I stand corrected.

01:09:44.662 --> 01:09:46.392
Pinot Noir, please.

01:09:47.299 --> 01:09:49.095
I take it you've been there?

01:09:50.035 --> 01:09:52.629
Uh... Uh... Um...
I just left, actually.

01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:55.432
We tried to go up, but it wasn't...

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:57.269
You're a little late in the season.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:58.808
So they tell me.

01:09:58.978 --> 01:10:01.845
- My name's Angelica.
- Yeah, Carter.

01:10:03.749 --> 01:10:07.185
I'm sorry if this sounds terrible...

01:10:07.353 --> 01:10:11.187
...but aren't you a little developed in
years to be running up a giant mountain?

01:10:14.159 --> 01:10:17.185
"Developed," now that's certainly
one way of putting it.

01:10:17.563 --> 01:10:19.087
Well, I've been up there, you know.

01:10:19.265 --> 01:10:20.323
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:10:20.499 --> 01:10:23.627
I made it to 26,000 feet
before we had to turn back.

01:10:24.169 --> 01:10:26.000
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.834
What was it like?

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:30.669
Cold...

01:10:30.843 --> 01:10:32.708
- Mm.
...mostly.

01:10:33.178 --> 01:10:37.046
During the day,
the sky is more black than blue.

01:10:37.216 --> 01:10:39.844
There's not enough air
to reflect the sunlight.

01:10:40.619 --> 01:10:45.613
But at night,
you've never seen so many stars.

01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:51.293
Seems like they're just out of reach,
and so bright.

01:10:51.697 --> 01:10:56.600
They're like little holes
in the floor of heaven.

01:11:04.043 --> 01:11:06.841
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

01:11:08.547 --> 01:11:12.039
I read an account of a man
who made it to the summit...

01:11:12.918 --> 01:11:17.014
...and standing there
at the top of the world...

01:11:18.023 --> 01:11:21.857
...he experienced
this profound silence.

01:11:22.227 --> 01:11:25.560
It was like all sound just fell away.

01:11:26.565 --> 01:11:28.123
And that's when he heard it.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:29.660
What?

01:11:31.003 --> 01:11:33.164
The sound of the mountain.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.835
He said it was like he heard
the voice of God.

01:11:45.651 --> 01:11:47.778
I've never done this before.

01:11:49.288 --> 01:11:52.689
That sounds like such a cliché...

01:11:55.294 --> 01:11:57.888
...but I have a room upstairs.

01:12:05.037 --> 01:12:06.595
Well, that's...

01:12:09.174 --> 01:12:10.766
I mean...

01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:12.575
I...

01:12:16.382 --> 01:12:18.577
I appreciate that.

01:12:19.718 --> 01:12:21.413
But you see...

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:28.226
She's a very lucky woman.

01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:31.487
Well, I rather think I'm the lucky one.

01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:33.894
Good for you.

01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:48.511
Tom?

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:52.773
Three things to remember
when you get older:

01:12:52.951 --> 01:12:54.612
Never pass up a bathroom...

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:58.984
...never waste a hard-on,
and never trust a fart.

01:12:59.224 --> 01:13:02.990
I'll keep that in mind
as I approach decrepitude.

01:13:03.162 --> 01:13:05.357
Heh-heh. That's a good one there.

01:13:05.998 --> 01:13:07.431
Let's go home.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:08.827
Excuse me?

01:13:09.001 --> 01:13:11.265
I want to go home now.

01:13:11.437 --> 01:13:14.600
But I thought that...
What about the silk suits?

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.974
That was very clever of you, Edward.

01:13:20.345 --> 01:13:22.609
How'd you know
I wouldn't go through with it?

01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:25.643
I didn't.

01:13:35.027 --> 01:13:36.858
I'm proud of you.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:40.359
Nobody cares what you think.

01:14:03.422 --> 01:14:05.287
America.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:27.239
Hey, Tommy, this isn't
the way to Crenshaw.

01:14:28.313 --> 01:14:31.714
There's an accident on the 10.
We're taking the surface streets.

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:33.351
Uh-huh.

01:14:47.466 --> 01:14:49.434
Why are we, uh?

01:14:53.939 --> 01:14:55.804
Oh, my God.

01:14:55.974 --> 01:14:59.239
He's kept tabs on her.
Just in case you decided to...

01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:01.072
This was your idea, Tom?

01:15:01.246 --> 01:15:03.476
No, it was my idea.
I talked him into it.

01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:05.742
- Yeah, talked him into it.
- Hey.

01:15:05.951 --> 01:15:08.784
Wait a minute. Edward. Edward?
Wait a minute.

01:15:08.954 --> 01:15:11.616
Edward. What are you so afraid of?

01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:16.284
Just because I told you my story
does not invite you to be a part of it.

01:15:16.461 --> 01:15:18.088
Oh. Like the lady in the bar?

01:15:18.297 --> 01:15:20.265
- That's different.
- Tell me how.

01:15:20.866 --> 01:15:22.959
- Because it is!
- How is it different?

01:15:23.168 --> 01:15:26.569
You have no fucking idea who I am!

01:15:26.738 --> 01:15:29.673
I built a billion-dollar business
up from nothing!

01:15:29.908 --> 01:15:31.671
Presidents have asked my advice.

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:35.971
I have dined with royalty and I'm
supposed to make out like, what...

01:15:36.148 --> 01:15:38.810
...this trip was supposed to
mean something to me?

01:15:38.984 --> 01:15:41.817
Like it was gonna change me?

01:15:43.989 --> 01:15:48.085
How did you see it playing out, Carter?
I knock on the door, she answers.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.023
She's surprised and angry...

01:15:50.262 --> 01:15:53.425
...but I tell her how much I love her
and miss her.

01:15:53.599 --> 01:15:56.466
And, " Oh. By the way,
I'm gonna be dead soon...

01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:59.763
...so I'm reaching out to you
because I don't wanna die alone"?

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.530
Everyone is afraid to die alone.

01:16:01.773 --> 01:16:04.173
I'm not everyone!

01:16:06.011 --> 01:16:09.344
This was supposed to be fun.

01:16:10.449 --> 01:16:13.043
That's all it ever was.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.616
No, you don't get in. Call a cab.

01:17:55.787 --> 01:17:59.154
<i>Dear Heavenly Father,
we Just want to thank you for this day...</i>

01:17:59.391 --> 01:18:02.554
...for having our family here together,
once again.

01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:05.993
And, Lord, we just want to thank you
for returning my husband...

01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:07.893
...their father, Lord, to us.

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:12.162
Is he crying?

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:13.991
I don't know.

01:19:14.499 --> 01:19:16.524
He's usually so much fun.

01:19:22.908 --> 01:19:24.466
Oh...

01:19:28.146 --> 01:19:29.511
- Wait a minute.
- What?

01:19:29.681 --> 01:19:31.478
- I got something for us.
- Oh?

01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:34.050
I wasn't sure I'd need it.

01:19:34.219 --> 01:19:35.584
Sure.

01:19:35.754 --> 01:19:37.984
Ow!
- Heh.

01:19:39.624 --> 01:19:41.649
Okay.

01:19:52.571 --> 01:19:54.436
You know how long it's been?

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.500
Do I wanna know?

01:19:58.944 --> 01:20:00.741
Well, it's been longer than that.

01:20:22.734 --> 01:20:26.727
You know, I feel like a teenager.
Like our first time.

01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:31.205
Uh, if we were teenagers, we never
would've gotten out of that living room.

01:20:31.543 --> 01:20:33.738
I remember the first time.

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:36.608
There was no tiptoeing around.

01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:40.376
You were on me like... that.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.478
Carter?

01:20:44.923 --> 01:20:48.620
Oh, you playing hide-and-seek
now, huh? Okay.

01:20:50.128 --> 01:20:51.755
Carter!

01:20:52.197 --> 01:20:55.564
- which resulted in a 15 percent
increase in cash assets...

01:20:55.734 --> 01:20:59.431
...following the sale of the recovery
center to Phillips Medical.

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.401
Mr. Cole?

01:21:04.643 --> 01:21:06.508
Mr. Cole?

01:21:06.711 --> 01:21:09.339
<i>You ever read The Divine Comedy?</i>

01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:12.616
Excuse me, sir?

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:18.454
<i>The Divine Comedy,
Dante Alighieri's journey into hell.</i>

01:21:22.494 --> 01:21:23.927
Maybe we should take a break.

01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:25.924
We don't need a break.

01:21:26.097 --> 01:21:29.362
I'm in remission.
I'm a goddamn medical miracle.

01:21:29.534 --> 01:21:31.525
I'm simply asking...

01:21:31.736 --> 01:21:35.331
<i>...if you ever read The Divine Comedy.</i>

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.098
Sir, you have a phone call.

01:21:37.943 --> 01:21:39.877
Tommy, not now.

01:21:40.111 --> 01:21:41.840
I really think you should take this.

01:21:54.192 --> 01:21:55.557
Uh...

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.284
Hey, Edward.

01:21:57.462 --> 01:21:58.656
What's the prognosis?

01:21:58.863 --> 01:22:00.490
It's metastasized to his brain.

01:22:00.665 --> 01:22:03.634
Metast... Operable?

01:22:03.802 --> 01:22:05.997
The odds aren't what
we'd like them to be.

01:22:08.073 --> 01:22:09.904
Odds.

01:22:10.775 --> 01:22:12.072
Jesus.

01:22:32.063 --> 01:22:33.223
How's he doing?

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.031
He's doing okay.

01:22:42.874 --> 01:22:45.399
Uh, he wanted me to give you this.

01:22:45.577 --> 01:22:47.943
I was supposed to wait until after...

01:22:48.179 --> 01:22:50.841
...but then I thought...

01:22:51.016 --> 01:22:53.348
She never listened to me before.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:57.552
Why change a winning formula?

01:23:00.325 --> 01:23:02.088
You look like shit, Ray.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:04.718
Thanks.

01:23:05.697 --> 01:23:07.221
How they treating you?

01:23:09.034 --> 01:23:11.229
Pea soup still sucks.

01:23:11.636 --> 01:23:13.934
I'll have a word with the owner.

01:23:14.572 --> 01:23:16.437
You do that.

01:23:28.119 --> 01:23:30.087
Can I have some water?

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:33.656
You can't have water, but I'll get you
some of those lemon swabs, okay?

01:23:33.858 --> 01:23:34.916
All right.

01:23:50.575 --> 01:23:53.408
You still drinking that fancy coffee?

01:23:53.578 --> 01:23:55.136
What?

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:56.908
What are you, obsessed?

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:03.944
Read it.

01:24:06.391 --> 01:24:10.452
"Kopi Luwak is the world's
most expensive coffee.

01:24:10.628 --> 01:24:15.827
Though for some, it falls under
the category of 'too good to be true.'

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.026
In the Sumatran village
where the beans are grown...

01:24:19.204 --> 01:24:21.968
...lives a breed of wild tree cat.

01:24:22.173 --> 01:24:27.008
These cats eat the beans,
digest them and then...

01:24:27.178 --> 01:24:29.009
...defecate.

01:24:30.782 --> 01:24:35.310
The villagers then collect
and process the stools.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:39.890
It is the combination of the beans
and the gastric juices of the tree cat...

01:24:40.058 --> 01:24:44.495
...that give Kopi Luwak
its unique flavor...

01:24:44.662 --> 01:24:46.562
...and aroma."

01:24:47.799 --> 01:24:49.198
You're shitting me.

01:24:51.302 --> 01:24:53.702
Cats beat me to it.

01:25:13.725 --> 01:25:16.455
- You got a pen? Give me a pen.
- What?

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:18.662
What?

01:25:41.085 --> 01:25:42.279
Here.

01:25:47.892 --> 01:25:49.917
It's not finished.

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:51.927
Well...

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.528
It's not a one-man deal.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.132
I'm afraid it'll have to be.

01:26:21.559 --> 01:26:22.958
We're ready.

01:26:31.536 --> 01:26:33.231
I'll be here when you get back.

01:26:33.738 --> 01:26:35.763
Sounds good to me.

01:27:18.182 --> 01:27:22.619
<i>Dear Edward, I've gone
back and forth the last few days...</i>

01:27:22.787 --> 01:27:26.120
<i>... trying to decide whether or not
I should even write this.</i>

01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:32.118
<i>In the end, I realized
I would regret it if I didn't...</i>

01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:34.458
<i>... so here goes.</i>

01:27:35.466 --> 01:27:37.457
<i>I know the last time
we saw each other...</i>

01:27:37.635 --> 01:27:40.695
<i>... we weren't exactly hitting
the sweetest notes.</i>

01:27:40.872 --> 01:27:44.103
<i>It certainly wasn't the way
I wanted the trip to end.</i>

01:27:46.210 --> 01:27:51.238
<i>I suppose I'm responsible,
and for that I'm sorry.</i>

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:56.476
<i>But, in all honesty,
if I had the chance, I'd do it again.</i>

01:28:00.625 --> 01:28:04.618
<i>Virginia said I left a stranger
and came back a husband.</i>

01:28:05.563 --> 01:28:07.690
<i>I owe that to you.</i>

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:13.197
<i>There's no way I can repay you
for all you've done for me...</i>

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:19.173
<i>... so rather than try, I'm Just going to
ask you to do something else for me.</i>

01:28:19.944 --> 01:28:22.435
<i>Find the Joy in your life.</i>

01:28:24.682 --> 01:28:27.242
<i>You once said you're not everyone.</i>

01:28:27.418 --> 01:28:29.886
<i>Well, that's true.</i>

01:28:30.054 --> 01:28:32.522
<i>You're certainly not everyone.</i>

01:28:33.057 --> 01:28:36.857
<i>But everyone is everyone.</i>

01:28:39.597 --> 01:28:41.565
<i>My pastor always says:</i>

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.660
<i>" Our lives are streams...</i>

01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:47.037
<i>... flowing into the same river...</i>

01:28:47.205 --> 01:28:51.608
<i>... towards whatever heaven lies
in the mist beyond the falls. "</i>

01:28:51.776 --> 01:28:55.212
Hello, sweetie. Hi.

01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:58.178
<i>Find the Joy in your life, Edward.</i>

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:06.322
<i>My dear friend...</i>

01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:12.294
<i>... close your eyes
and let the waters take you home.</i>

01:29:14.999 --> 01:29:19.561
Good afternoon.
My name is Edward Cole.

01:29:22.473 --> 01:29:27.570
I don't know what most people say
at these occasions, because...

01:29:28.012 --> 01:29:30.503
...in all honesty, I...

01:29:31.816 --> 01:29:34.785
I've tried to avoid them.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:41.258
The simplest thing is...

01:29:41.426 --> 01:29:45.522
...I loved him and I miss him.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:53.930
Carter and I saw the world together.

01:29:55.673 --> 01:29:57.800
Which is amazing...

01:29:57.975 --> 01:30:00.671
...when you think that only
three months ago...

01:30:00.845 --> 01:30:03.678
...we were complete strangers.

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.651
I hope...

01:30:12.156 --> 01:30:15.557
...that it doesn't sound
selfish of me...

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:19.992
...but the last months of his life...

01:30:20.164 --> 01:30:23.463
...were the best months of mine.

01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:27.665
He saved my life.

01:30:28.706 --> 01:30:31.800
And he knew it before I did.

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:39.013
<i>I'm deeply proud that this man...</i>

01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:43.586
<i>... found it worth his while
to know me.</i>

01:30:45.323 --> 01:30:47.257
<i>In the end...</i>

01:30:47.425 --> 01:30:53.159
<i>... I think it's safe to say that we brought
some Joy to one another's lives.</i>

01:30:53.498 --> 01:30:56.524
<i>So, one day, when...</i>

01:30:57.235 --> 01:31:00.671
<i>... I go to some final resting place...</i>

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:06.033
<i>... if I happen to wake up
next to a certain wall with a gate...</i>

01:31:06.210 --> 01:31:09.407
<i>... I hope that Carter's there...</i>

01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.810
<i>... to vouch for me...</i>

01:31:12.016 --> 01:31:15.008
<i>... and show me the ropes
on the other side.</i>

01:31:21.626 --> 01:31:24.459
<i>Edward Perriman Cole died in May.</i>

01:31:25.630 --> 01:31:28.428
<i>It was a Sunday, in the afternoon...</i>

01:31:28.599 --> 01:31:31.966
<i>... and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.</i>

01:31:32.136 --> 01:31:34.229
<i>He was 81 years old.</i>

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:40.774
<i>Even now, I can't claim to understand
the measure of a life.</i>

01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.139
<i>But I can tell you this:</i>

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:49.083
<i>I know that when he died,
his eyes were closed...</i>

01:31:49.854 --> 01:31:52.414
<i>... and his heart was open.</i>

01:31:53.858 --> 01:31:58.227
<i>And I'm pretty sure he was happy
with his final resting place...</i>

01:31:58.996 --> 01:32:02.295
<i>... because he was buried
on the mountain...</i>

01:32:03.301 --> 01:32:06.099
<i>... and that was against the law.</i>

01:36:57.862 --> 01:36:59.853
