02:33.736 --> 02:36.933
You're going to love this one.
Listen up, here we go.

03:27.523 --> 03:30.492
Here you go, Pluto. What did you think?

03:30.660 --> 03:33.185
l don't know what to think, Tony.
l mean....

03:33.263 --> 03:35.026
You got a dress on....

03:35.431 --> 03:39.993
This is not a dress, it's a kilt.
Scottish tradition. Very manly, a kilt.

03:40.069 --> 03:41.229
lt's a manly dress.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.568
No, a kilt.
That's how people know who l am.

03:43.640 --> 03:48.077
People think of Anthony Frankowski,
they immediately think ''Scottish crooning.''

03:48.144 --> 03:52.478
There lies your problem. That's not even
a thing. Did you make that up?

03:52.548 --> 03:55.608
Yes, l made that up.
lt's a thing if l made it up.

03:55.752 --> 03:57.720
-lt's horrible.
-lt's my hook!

03:57.921 --> 04:01.379
You know what you need to do
if you're going to croon? Be ltalian.

04:01.557 --> 04:03.752
Be Anthony Frantucci.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.989
-You want me to change my name?
-Yeah, to something that swings.

04:07.063 --> 04:09.861
-Anthony Frandicci.
-That doesn't swing.

04:09.933 --> 04:11.025
Anthony...

04:12.035 --> 04:13.024
...Francis.

04:13.202 --> 04:14.863
-Tony Francis.
-You like that?

04:14.938 --> 04:15.996
l'm Tony Francis.

04:16.072 --> 04:18.563
That's a good name.
You're Tony Francis now.

04:18.641 --> 04:20.575
Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Francis.

04:20.642 --> 04:23.874
Absolutely. l like it.
Lose the dress, change the name.

04:24.047 --> 04:26.572
-ls your bathroom back there?
-Through the doors.

04:28.618 --> 04:29.880
Tony Francis.

04:35.825 --> 04:37.759
Am l supposed to piss in the kitchen?

04:37.927 --> 04:39.417
No, it's off to the right.

04:57.113 --> 05:02.073
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
please welcome Mr. Tony Francis!

05:03.987 --> 05:06.922
''Oh, my God! lt's Tony Francis! ''

05:09.325 --> 05:10.849
How is showbiz?

05:19.068 --> 05:19.966
Disgusting.

05:46.863 --> 05:48.125
Take a walk, hotshot.

05:48.197 --> 05:49.664
Pluto, help me!

05:50.800 --> 05:51.789
Pluto?

05:52.135 --> 05:54.729
-Pluto Nash?
-That's right!

05:54.904 --> 05:57.464
-When did you get out of the joint?
-A week ago.

06:01.044 --> 06:02.511
Congratulations.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.768
Thanks a lot.

06:03.846 --> 06:05.313
l'm Gino.

06:05.481 --> 06:09.212
This is my nephew, Larry.
Larry, say hello to Pluto Nash.

06:09.385 --> 06:10.716
What's going on?

06:10.787 --> 06:14.883
My brother was inside with you.
Angelo Sotobolo.

06:15.158 --> 06:17.058
Angelo Cheesecake is your brother?

06:17.226 --> 06:21.526
We used to play cards in his cell every
weekend. He'd have the shit catered.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.157
-He thinks the world of you.
-lt's mutual.

06:25.234 --> 06:27.168
Pluto is my best friend.

06:28.604 --> 06:31.573
What are you guys doing?
What's going on, Gino?

06:31.741 --> 06:33.902
We're cleaning out his digestive system.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.973
Gino, l can't let you do that, man.

06:42.385 --> 06:43.374
Pluto.

06:43.519 --> 06:48.456
Your pal borrowed $2.5 million
from me four years ago...

06:48.524 --> 06:51.516
-...to buy this joint.
-On an easy payment plan.

06:55.131 --> 06:57.565
Here. l think that will get it off.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.364
-How much does he owe you now?
-$2.5 million.

07:01.537 --> 07:03.596
-He didn't pay anything back?
-No.

07:03.739 --> 07:05.604
Any idiot can make money here.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.667
This guy has to do
his cockamamie act each night.

07:09.078 --> 07:10.670
lt's like a damn freak show.

07:10.746 --> 07:13.408
l seen it. You see where this shit got you?

07:13.483 --> 07:14.814
Gino, listen.

07:15.284 --> 07:18.720
l'm not in the smuggling business anymore.
l'm opening my own club.

07:18.788 --> 07:19.720
No kidding.

07:19.789 --> 07:23.691
lt's always been a lifelong dream of mine
to have my own club.

07:23.793 --> 07:24.782
Life--

07:25.962 --> 07:28.829
Dinner and dancing and nice atmosphere.

07:29.132 --> 07:30.497
Good place, hot music.

07:30.666 --> 07:35.126
Once l get it going, l'll sit back,
light up a cigar and enjoy the party.

07:35.304 --> 07:36.532
What could be better?

07:36.873 --> 07:39.433
Nothing could be better.
We could be partners.

07:40.109 --> 07:41.633
You know what?

07:42.078 --> 07:46.947
What if l pay off his debt,
take over this place, and we call it square?

07:57.093 --> 07:59.027
Let's have a drink and talk about it.

07:59.095 --> 08:00.323
Out of these glasses?

08:00.963 --> 08:04.160
-Are you crazy? Across the street.
-All right.

08:05.868 --> 08:08.496
What will you do about my friend?

08:09.038 --> 08:10.130
Anthony?

08:11.774 --> 08:13.036
My gift to you.

08:13.843 --> 08:14.969
You're a prince.

08:15.044 --> 08:18.844
l'll go across the street and have
some beers and work out the logistics.

08:19.015 --> 08:22.507
Just sit here in your skirt
and l'll see you in a minute.

08:28.991 --> 08:31.118
9:18 Lunar Grand Express...

08:31.294 --> 08:34.491
...now ready for general boarding
on platform 22.

08:53.749 --> 08:55.649
Welcome to the Moon.

08:55.818 --> 08:59.686
While you're here, be sure and visit
the Lunar Grand Resort and Casino...

08:59.855 --> 09:02.380
...only two hours away by hover shuttle.

09:02.625 --> 09:07.619
Remember, Moon Beach is the only place
in the universe where gambling is legal.

09:08.831 --> 09:12.699
The Lunar Grand.
The perfect family vacation.

09:41.764 --> 09:42.958
lncoming!

09:43.399 --> 09:44.388
Thanks, Pluto!

09:47.303 --> 09:50.636
Pace yourselves. lt's only 10:00.
This ain't a bachelor party.

09:50.706 --> 09:54.540
Yeah, it is.
Tommy here is getting divorced tomorrow.

09:54.610 --> 09:56.908
-Really? Congratulations.
-Thank you.

09:56.979 --> 10:00.608
l tell you what. Drinks are on the house
for the rest of the night.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.540
You're the best, Pluto!

10:04.253 --> 10:05.481
Excuse me a second.

10:05.554 --> 10:06.782
Thanks a lot, Pluto.

10:07.957 --> 10:09.322
He's the best!

10:09.992 --> 10:13.257
Crank it up. l'm not running a library
in here! Crank it up!

10:23.973 --> 10:24.962
All right!

10:27.843 --> 10:29.777
Keep it like that! Keep it pumping!

10:32.081 --> 10:33.412
Hey, Miguel!

10:40.089 --> 10:43.650
-Not bad for a Tuesday night.
-Not bad at all.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.717
lt's like the whole city turned out.

10:47.463 --> 10:49.192
We've come a long way, baby.

10:49.365 --> 10:51.128
Long way. All right, partner.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.100
-Look at that ass. l'll be right back.
-Oh, my goodness.

10:55.971 --> 10:57.939
Sorry, l'll get that.

11:02.111 --> 11:03.203
Sorry.

11:03.512 --> 11:05.503
lt's all right, it's okay.

11:09.018 --> 11:12.181
Could you help me?
l'm looking for the owner, Pluto Nash.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.222
Why are you looking for that lowlife?

11:14.290 --> 11:15.382
lt's personal.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.486
He doesn't even know you.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.357
-Yes, he does.
-No, l don't.

11:19.995 --> 11:21.155
You're him?

11:21.230 --> 11:24.131
Last time l checked. How can l help you?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.932
l just came all the way from Salt Lake City.

11:27.002 --> 11:27.991
Rough town.

11:28.304 --> 11:32.365
l'm a good singer. l got this gig,
they gave me a one-way ticket up here.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.773
But the guys who own the nightclub sold it.

11:34.877 --> 11:39.837
l'm dead broke. l need a job.
l want to go home. Can you help me out?

11:39.915 --> 11:41.348
Sorry, l can't help you.

11:41.417 --> 11:45.217
l'm sure there's a bunch of clubs
that can use a good singer, but we got a DJ.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.379
Take it easy.

11:46.689 --> 11:50.785
l'm sure they could,
but my Moon card expired...

11:50.860 --> 11:54.591
...and l was told you were the one person
in town who might overlook that.

11:54.663 --> 11:56.858
Who told you something foolish like that?

11:57.066 --> 11:59.296
You know my father, Nicholas Lake?

12:00.236 --> 12:01.726
Never heard of him.

12:02.338 --> 12:03.566
Nicky Sticks?

12:03.739 --> 12:05.366
That's your father?

12:06.075 --> 12:07.838
Unbelievable. That's something.

12:09.578 --> 12:13.981
Normally l don't call in favors,
but my dad did save your life back in '76.

12:14.283 --> 12:17.116
He didn't save my life, l saved his life.

12:17.286 --> 12:19.447
And l lost a fine automobile in the process.

12:19.522 --> 12:23.390
Unless you got a new Plymouth
with my name on it, l got nothing to say.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.986
So, good night.

12:25.528 --> 12:26.756
Thanks, Dad.

12:26.929 --> 12:29.227
l should have known. l'm sorry.

12:37.773 --> 12:39.138
Maybe l got something.

12:39.241 --> 12:42.938
Really? Great! Shall we say
two shows a night, five nights a week?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.503
Shall we say six nights a week
waiting tables?

12:45.614 --> 12:48.947
You can save up your tips, make
enough money to get back home. Deal?

12:51.053 --> 12:51.849
Deal.

13:13.642 --> 13:17.271
-ls it like this every night?
-Only the slow ones.

13:17.813 --> 13:19.246
Somebody is coming in.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.747
Sorry, fellows, we're closed.

13:22.418 --> 13:23.908
We're here to see Mr. Nash.

13:24.153 --> 13:25.518
ls he expecting you?

13:31.093 --> 13:34.028
$10 million is more than a fair offer,
Mr. Nash.

13:34.296 --> 13:37.663
l don't know. l own
the most successful club in Little America.

13:37.833 --> 13:42.167
l own it outright.
l'm my own boss, and l have the hottest--

13:45.474 --> 13:49.035
l got the best party in town.
Why would l want to sell this place?

13:49.845 --> 13:51.005
$10 million?

13:52.314 --> 13:54.043
Get your shit off my desk!

13:56.485 --> 13:57.611
No, boys.

13:57.786 --> 14:01.449
Please meet my friend
and bodyguard, Bruno.

14:05.628 --> 14:06.560
Gentlemen.

14:06.629 --> 14:08.062
Bruno, the boys.

14:08.964 --> 14:11.694
Looks like you're about due for a trade-in.

14:12.201 --> 14:13.498
Hey, Bruno.

14:13.802 --> 14:16.293
What are you, a '65?

14:16.505 --> 14:19.372
Model '63 Deluxe.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.466
'63? Talk about ancient.

14:21.710 --> 14:23.610
Your sister didn't seem to mind.

14:23.679 --> 14:25.044
Screw you, robot!

14:27.716 --> 14:29.445
He can be fixed, you can't.

14:31.220 --> 14:33.211
We don't mean to cause any problems.

14:33.389 --> 14:35.084
He's reaching, you know?

14:35.257 --> 14:36.724
Okay. No reaching.

14:38.193 --> 14:39.387
Mr. Nash...

14:41.230 --> 14:43.221
...this is non-negotiable.

14:45.234 --> 14:48.203
Rex Crater is buying your club.

14:49.405 --> 14:52.101
l was wondering when you all
was going to get to me.

14:53.008 --> 14:54.839
$10 million.

14:58.013 --> 15:02.143
Tell Mr. Crater, thanks, but no, thanks.
l won't sell my club.

15:02.217 --> 15:05.653
lf l have my way,
no one here will sell their place...

15:05.721 --> 15:09.555
...because we like this town the way it is.
So, if you'd be so kind, get out.

15:16.432 --> 15:19.128
Rex Crater does not like to be disappointed.

15:19.768 --> 15:22.498
l'll just have to send Mr. Crater
a case of Scotch!

15:26.408 --> 15:29.639
-Great first night, Dina.
-Thanks.

15:29.945 --> 15:34.041
Do me a favor. Run this up to Pluto.
l need to lock up the back.

15:35.618 --> 15:37.210
Thank you very much.

15:41.156 --> 15:42.316
Miguel?

15:42.891 --> 15:46.725
This isn't some send-up-the-new-girl
kind of a thing, right?

15:46.895 --> 15:50.387
No. Relax. He wouldn't do that.
You're safe, go ahead.

15:55.771 --> 15:56.965
Come on in.

16:00.676 --> 16:02.143
Perfect timing.

16:04.847 --> 16:06.747
Miguel asked me to bring it up.

16:07.116 --> 16:08.413
Perfect.

16:08.784 --> 16:10.342
Should l make it for you?

16:10.419 --> 16:13.718
No, l mix my own martinis.
But thank you, anyway.

16:13.789 --> 16:16.121
l got it down to a pretty good science.

16:29.038 --> 16:30.266
Perfect.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.967
l wanted to thank you again for the job.

16:34.276 --> 16:37.768
-Don't even mention it.
-Well, l am mentioning it. Thank you.

16:39.882 --> 16:41.315
You're very welcome.

16:41.550 --> 16:43.108
Let me get this, okay?

16:46.355 --> 16:48.050
-Hello?
-Hello, Nash.

16:48.123 --> 16:51.388
Don't call me this time of night.
What's wrong with you?

16:53.896 --> 16:55.193
You know Tony Francis?

16:55.364 --> 16:59.562
l knew him back when he was Anthony
Frankowski. We were like brothers.

16:59.635 --> 17:03.833
We grew up together. Me and Anthony
Frankowski, who would later become--

17:04.606 --> 17:07.268
l'll tell you a real funny story in a second.

17:08.210 --> 17:09.074
Hello?

17:09.144 --> 17:12.170
Just wanted to give you one last chance
to change your mind.

17:12.247 --> 17:16.148
Look, no now and no tomorrow.
No means no. Leave me alone.

17:16.518 --> 17:18.008
Now, you look--

17:18.587 --> 17:19.917
Clown.

17:20.856 --> 17:21.982
Who was that?

17:22.057 --> 17:24.582
One of Rex Crater's boys,
trying to buy me out.

17:25.027 --> 17:27.018
Why is he so set on buying your club?

17:27.096 --> 17:30.065
Because they're about to approve gambling
in this town.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.192
lf Crater gets his way,
they'll turn the Moon into a big casino.

17:33.268 --> 17:36.465
You can't sell your club till l make
enough money to get back home.

17:36.538 --> 17:40.497
l'll let him know the next time he calls
that you got to get your money first.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.319
-You all right? You okay?
-Yeah.

17:55.457 --> 17:57.482
-What happened?
-l don't know!

18:00.562 --> 18:01.859
Come on.

18:07.736 --> 18:09.033
Bruno!

18:10.239 --> 18:12.764
Bomb detonated. Evacuate.

18:13.976 --> 18:14.908
Evacuate.

18:15.377 --> 18:17.038
Bomb detonated.

18:17.312 --> 18:18.301
Evacuate.

18:21.583 --> 18:24.575
Bruno, look what they did to my place!

18:25.821 --> 18:26.981
Pluto!

18:30.492 --> 18:31.789
Damn!

18:33.862 --> 18:34.988
Let's get them.

18:35.063 --> 18:36.553
No. Stay here with her!

18:42.237 --> 18:45.604
-Bruno, l think that's one of them.
-l'll intercept the call.

18:46.441 --> 18:50.138
''Nash is alive. He took off after Jimmy,
who's headed for the Vac.

18:50.646 --> 18:51.874
''Be ready for him.''

18:52.181 --> 18:53.205
What's the Vac?

18:53.282 --> 18:56.843
The Perfect Vacuum, at the corner
of Glenn Avenue and Fifth. Why?

18:56.919 --> 18:58.682
Didn't you hear the phone call?

18:58.754 --> 19:01.587
l'm sorry, l cannot listen and hear
at the same time.

19:01.657 --> 19:04.217
You see, l'm a '63.
Only later models can do that!

19:04.293 --> 19:07.057
-Pluto's in trouble. Come on.
-Trouble?

19:08.197 --> 19:12.725
-ls that as fast as you go?
-l'm a '63! l'm at top speed!

19:28.450 --> 19:29.815
Get out of the way!

19:32.454 --> 19:36.390
Reset. Reset. Reset.

20:11.526 --> 20:14.120
You try to shake me down,
then you blow up my club?

20:14.196 --> 20:15.788
You blew up my wood barstools!

20:15.864 --> 20:18.230
You know how hard it is
to get wood on the Moon?

20:22.437 --> 20:23.131
Shit!

20:23.205 --> 20:27.505
You want to play games?
You have to shoot around your boy!

20:27.576 --> 20:29.373
lt's easier to shoot through him.

20:30.512 --> 20:31.342
Shit!

20:50.365 --> 20:52.697
-Pluto, it's a trap!
-Yeah, no kidding!

21:33.608 --> 21:35.337
Did you ever shoot a gun before?

21:49.057 --> 21:50.285
Time to go, Bruno!

21:53.695 --> 21:54.992
All clear, boss!

21:55.430 --> 21:56.226
Come on!

21:59.301 --> 22:00.962
Bruno, heel!

22:05.574 --> 22:08.236
-You are really something, you know that?
-Thank you.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.876
You walked right into a trap
any idiot could see from a mile away.

22:11.947 --> 22:14.177
l was walking right out
until you came along.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.477
-Really?
-Yes, really.

22:15.550 --> 22:18.041
You put your neck on the line,
l appreciate that.

22:18.120 --> 22:22.216
But in the future, not that there'll be
a future, if l need your help, l'll ask.

22:22.290 --> 22:24.656
Don't worry about it,
l'm getting out of here.

22:24.826 --> 22:29.354
l saved your life twice. Least you can do
is loan me enough money so l can go home.

22:29.531 --> 22:33.433
l would, but they'll be looking for you
at every bus station and shuttle launch.

22:33.502 --> 22:35.800
Me? They don't even know
what l look like.

22:35.871 --> 22:39.034
Every club in this city
has a biometric camera system.

22:39.107 --> 22:42.167
They took hundreds of pictures of you.
They know what you look like.

22:42.344 --> 22:44.869
Only way you're going home now
is in a box.

22:46.181 --> 22:48.342
That's just great. Now what?

22:49.451 --> 22:50.543
After you.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.149
Hey, Roy.

22:59.327 --> 23:01.454
Pluto! What are you doing here?

23:01.630 --> 23:06.067
My place is getting redecorated
and l need a place overnight.

23:06.234 --> 23:10.136
Sure! 3D. The code is 4-5-7.

23:10.205 --> 23:11.365
Thanks, Roy.

23:26.855 --> 23:30.757
So, this is the Garden of Paradise.

23:32.027 --> 23:32.959
My, my.

23:33.028 --> 23:35.326
lf this is too glitzy for you...

23:35.964 --> 23:38.455
...tomorrow we can get a room
at the Garden of Eden.

23:38.533 --> 23:40.626
They got a bathroom on every floor.

23:42.104 --> 23:43.332
l hate the Moon.

23:43.405 --> 23:45.703
Know why Mooners can't stand Earthlings?

23:45.774 --> 23:49.403
You think everything back Earth is better
and can't stop talking about it.

23:49.478 --> 23:52.379
l went back Earth once
and the air smelled funny.

23:52.647 --> 23:56.674
Sneezing all the time, rained every day,
bugs and shit everywhere.

23:56.751 --> 23:59.219
You know the only thing l liked about it?

23:59.287 --> 24:01.517
-You could see the Moon at night?
-Bingo.

24:06.695 --> 24:10.688
-ls something wrong with your toaster?
-He's all right. He's just recharging.

24:11.566 --> 24:12.794
Can he hear us?

24:13.201 --> 24:14.634
Not while he's charging.

24:14.703 --> 24:18.696
Shouldn't your bodyguard be able to keep
up with you on the way to a gunfight?

24:19.074 --> 24:21.304
You might want to think
about trading him in.

24:21.443 --> 24:24.469
l can't trade in Bruno.
We got a history together.

24:24.613 --> 24:27.582
l got 20 years of rill-hopping experience
wired into him.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.479
-Rill-hopping?
-Well, that's a....

24:30.919 --> 24:33.888
Smuggling. That's what l went to jail for.

24:34.656 --> 24:38.888
He ain't the fastest thing in the world,
but he got me out of lots of tight squeezes.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.552
A little smokier than usual.

24:40.629 --> 24:42.824
-He's a fire hazard.
-He's all right.

24:42.931 --> 24:44.193
Where are you going?

24:44.266 --> 24:47.099
l got to go talk to an old friend,
see what l can find out.

24:47.169 --> 24:48.636
What am l supposed to do?

24:48.703 --> 24:51.399
Make sure
Bruno don't burn the place down.

24:51.473 --> 24:54.203
-You're leaving me alone with him?
-l left.

24:54.276 --> 24:55.265
Pluto!

25:09.791 --> 25:12.089
You're getting kind of old, Rowland.

25:12.260 --> 25:16.720
You should be so lucky. Every lowlife
in town is looking to whack you.

25:16.798 --> 25:19.028
l'm a popular guy. What can l say?

25:19.201 --> 25:20.725
You want to lose some money?

25:20.802 --> 25:24.101
No, but you'll lose money.
We'll play some eight ball, regular stakes.

25:24.472 --> 25:27.168
-l will kindly empty your wallet for you.
-You're on.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.304
How is your mother?

25:33.548 --> 25:35.448
Still breaking hearts.

25:36.184 --> 25:37.481
Pizza time.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.545
She should have married me.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.748
You should have went to the gym
and lost weight.

25:41.823 --> 25:45.691
l'd have lost the weight if she married me.
Otherwise, what's the point?

25:45.760 --> 25:49.491
l really need your help.
l got to get to Rex Crater.

25:49.664 --> 25:51.427
Forget it. Nobody gets to him.

25:51.499 --> 25:54.991
-Who the hell is this guy?
-A myth, an enigma.

25:56.671 --> 25:59.504
He lives in a penthouse
above the Lunar Grand Hotel.

25:59.874 --> 26:01.273
Never comes out.

26:01.343 --> 26:03.072
You was a cop for 20 years.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.339
You got to have some kind of idea
who he is.

26:05.413 --> 26:07.278
Some people think he's a clone.

26:08.383 --> 26:11.409
There was a clone doctor
named Runa Pedanken.

26:11.853 --> 26:15.721
Made a big name for herself creating
a basketball team from one old guy.

26:16.024 --> 26:17.389
The Air Jordans.

26:18.927 --> 26:22.920
Right after cloning was outlawed
back Earth, Pedanken came up here.

26:23.164 --> 26:26.133
She was the best in her field
until she got herself murdered.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.029
That was about eight years ago.

26:31.873 --> 26:34.205
l'm going to need to hack into police files.

26:34.476 --> 26:37.104
You mean, you need me
to hack into police files.

26:37.479 --> 26:39.174
l thought you'd never ask.

26:43.918 --> 26:46.751
Pedanken, Runa. lnitiate global search.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.291
File deleted.

26:51.893 --> 26:53.656
Sorry, that's all there is.

26:54.129 --> 26:56.825
She wasn't doing this by herself.
Who worked with her?

26:56.898 --> 26:59.162
She had an assistant.

26:59.467 --> 27:02.732
We questioned her for days
about the murder. Got nothing.

27:02.871 --> 27:06.329
That's because you have no finesse.
Who is she and where do l find her?

27:06.408 --> 27:07.534
Mona Zimmer.

27:10.679 --> 27:13.978
Runs a body alteration shop
on Microsoft and Sixth.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.414
That's what l love about you.

27:15.483 --> 27:18.543
l ask you a simple question,
four hours later, l get a simple answer.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.404
Boss?

27:41.009 --> 27:42.909
Where did the boss go?

27:43.144 --> 27:46.807
l don't know. Out.
He said to wait for him here.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.143
Out?

27:48.416 --> 27:50.509
He never goes anywhere without me.

27:51.853 --> 27:54.413
And l heard that toaster crack.

27:55.423 --> 27:57.653
Bruno, give me that old badge you got.

27:59.394 --> 28:01.862
-Who are we going to arrest?
-l need your help.

28:03.765 --> 28:04.754
Sure.

28:05.834 --> 28:07.062
Where are we going?

28:07.135 --> 28:10.298
lt's just got to be the two of us.
You go next time. Promise.

28:12.807 --> 28:14.832
That's gratitude for you.

28:28.390 --> 28:32.326
We were hoping that for our anniversary
we could get a brand-new us.

28:32.994 --> 28:34.484
How romantic.

28:34.996 --> 28:36.861
You're in luck!

28:36.931 --> 28:39.957
l just happen to have a cancellation.

28:40.034 --> 28:41.160
Fantastic!

28:41.236 --> 28:45.172
Are you all original
or have you been previously improved?

28:46.508 --> 28:47.600
All original.

28:47.876 --> 28:48.774
Really?

28:48.843 --> 28:50.936
Yes, from top to bottom.

28:51.012 --> 28:54.379
Okay, then.
Well, what exactly did you have in mind?

28:54.749 --> 28:58.913
We were thinking we could start
with some ass-resculpting for her...

28:58.987 --> 29:01.387
...to get a little more bubblage--

29:01.923 --> 29:03.857
l happen to have a great ass!

29:03.925 --> 29:07.258
l'm not saying your ass isn't great.
We'd like something--

29:07.662 --> 29:10.290
Could you do something
about his big mouth?

29:10.365 --> 29:13.232
Do you have any catalogues?
Maybe we could get some ideas.

29:13.301 --> 29:16.737
Come this way,
l'll show you exactly what you want.

29:17.005 --> 29:17.994
Thank you.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.835
Come on, honey.
Look at the asses on the wall.

29:20.909 --> 29:22.433
Yeah. Don't push it.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.588
Let's start with some
of the basic body types.

29:35.657 --> 29:38.956
Here's one l think you'll really like.
The Amazon.

29:40.128 --> 29:44.087
l don't like that. That makes me
look like a big dufus, doesn't it?

29:44.265 --> 29:47.598
-Where would we buy clothes?
-l don't want to be the big dufus.

29:47.769 --> 29:49.634
Good point. Let me try again.

29:50.939 --> 29:53.772
This one l'm particularly proud of.

29:54.075 --> 29:56.236
The Venice Beach.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.484
Wait a minute.
l think you done found something there.

30:03.551 --> 30:04.779
Look at that, honey.

30:04.986 --> 30:07.147
Yeah, look at that. Look at me!

30:08.056 --> 30:09.387
This is me?

30:09.691 --> 30:10.680
lt could be.

30:11.326 --> 30:13.556
Honey, l'm looking and l'm thinking...

30:13.628 --> 30:17.758
...that you need to rethink the ass
enhancement. lt will work, it will help out.

30:18.299 --> 30:20.563
What you want is to have a.... You know?

30:21.569 --> 30:25.505
She also needs a little more of this, too,
up top. Can you fix this?

30:25.907 --> 30:29.536
lf you could spruce these up a little.
Just a little sprucier.

30:29.611 --> 30:31.476
l know that she has ample now.

30:31.546 --> 30:35.505
But l'm talking titties galore.
Let's have the titties really flowing.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.981
Yeah, like that.

30:42.290 --> 30:43.814
Look at that.

30:45.326 --> 30:47.851
Why don't we step into my office
and discuss the terms?

30:47.929 --> 30:50.762
Yes, let's go in and sign up! Look at that!

30:52.500 --> 30:57.733
Before we get started, there's a few things
l'd like to talk over with you.

30:57.805 --> 31:00.069
First of all, will you be paying in cash...

31:00.141 --> 31:03.440
...or would you like to take advantage
of our flexible financing plan?

31:03.511 --> 31:04.808
All in cash, all at once.

31:04.879 --> 31:08.576
-Excellent! Medical records?
-Right here.

31:08.650 --> 31:10.174
And police permit?

31:12.453 --> 31:14.318
Our police permits?

31:14.389 --> 31:19.486
l think you'll find
that our police permits are in order.

31:19.694 --> 31:21.389
Police permits.

31:21.829 --> 31:26.061
Sorry, no can do. Not without
a police permit. lt's Body Alteration 101 .

31:26.134 --> 31:28.432
You could be fugitives, killers, anybody.

31:28.503 --> 31:32.633
No, we're just a couple trying
to put the spark back in our relationship.

31:32.740 --> 31:35.573
The idea of revealing such personal details
to the police.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.543
Please, Dr. Zimmer?

31:37.712 --> 31:41.170
All right. Come back tonight, 8:00 sharp.

31:41.249 --> 31:43.774
But it's another $10,000 upon completion.

31:43.851 --> 31:46.012
All right. Then, doctor, you are busted.

31:46.921 --> 31:49.913
Give me a break.
What are you guys, the Health Department?

31:49.991 --> 31:53.154
You wish we were.
Listen, you got one chance.

31:53.294 --> 31:56.786
You answer some questions for me.
And l want the truth.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.659
Okay, what do you want to know?

31:59.100 --> 32:02.035
-When you worked for Runa Pedanken--
-l never heard of her.

32:02.103 --> 32:04.936
You want to play games?
Put the cuffs on her.

32:05.206 --> 32:06.400
Come on, cuff her.

32:08.242 --> 32:09.675
No! Just hold on!

32:10.078 --> 32:11.238
Hold the cuffs.

32:11.312 --> 32:15.180
Tell me everything you know
and don't play games with me, Mona.

32:15.249 --> 32:17.547
Talk to me. What do you know?
Right now.

32:19.220 --> 32:20.687
All right, all right.

32:20.989 --> 32:24.447
Towards the end, Runa was dealing
with some pretty heavy characters...

32:24.525 --> 32:28.655
...but she didn't tell me who.
And she didn't keep any records.

32:28.730 --> 32:33.224
But one day l walked into her office
as she was showing one of the guys out...

32:33.301 --> 32:35.462
...and he left his briefcase behind.

32:36.070 --> 32:38.868
The initials WZW were embossed on it...

32:39.240 --> 32:40.605
...in gold.

32:40.775 --> 32:44.973
And it was made out
of genuine alligator skin. Are you with me?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.411
Earth goods.

32:46.614 --> 32:48.673
That's all l know. l swear it.

32:50.218 --> 32:54.917
Just for the record, l have never had
one complaint about my ass.

32:55.089 --> 32:59.651
l was just playing. l said that for the lady.
lt was part of the scam.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.858
Ma, what are you doing here?

33:05.933 --> 33:07.798
Seeing that you're all right.

33:08.136 --> 33:10.104
Ma, this is Dina. Dina, my mother.

33:10.271 --> 33:11.465
You're his mother?

33:11.639 --> 33:13.607
Why, you got a problem with that?

33:13.775 --> 33:16.300
l'm surprised.
You could easily pass for his sister.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.378
Thank you.

33:17.445 --> 33:20.073
Why are you gallivanting around?
You'll wind up dead.

33:20.148 --> 33:22.776
l got to take care of those guys
that blew up my club.

33:22.850 --> 33:25.648
-You got to get your ass off the Moon!
-l don't think so.

33:25.820 --> 33:29.984
You think you're a hot-shit, ex-rill-hopping,
burned-down-club-owning guy...

33:30.058 --> 33:32.117
...but once in a while, listen to your mother.

33:32.193 --> 33:36.095
All right, l'll get off the Moon!
But can l get something to eat first?

33:36.898 --> 33:37.694
God!

33:37.765 --> 33:39.630
Bruno, get some beer and sandwiches.

33:41.302 --> 33:44.271
And you ought to be a little nicer
to your robot.

33:44.539 --> 33:46.439
Be nicer to my robot?

33:51.979 --> 33:53.970
You been in here bitching to my moms?

34:01.789 --> 34:02.813
Gentlemen.

34:03.624 --> 34:04.989
Suite with a hot tub?

34:05.059 --> 34:09.155
Which room is Nash in?
Lie to me and l will blow your head off.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.619
3D.

34:13.967 --> 34:16.163
You take the stairs.
You two, take the elevator.

34:16.237 --> 34:17.966
Let the robots take the stairs.

34:18.039 --> 34:19.438
You stay here.

34:20.675 --> 34:23.735
Pluto, this is Roy. You got company.

34:25.179 --> 34:26.737
We got to move out of here.

34:34.922 --> 34:36.321
Come on, this way!

34:39.393 --> 34:42.226
Bruno, check and see
if we can get out the window!

34:46.667 --> 34:49.261
Model DRL '84.

34:49.937 --> 34:51.699
Very nice.

34:52.239 --> 34:53.228
Bruno!

34:54.275 --> 34:55.742
Excuse me.

34:57.378 --> 34:59.073
Too high to jump!

35:03.551 --> 35:05.815
Bruno, see what you can do
with these bolts.

35:09.090 --> 35:10.717
Okay. Ready?

35:13.094 --> 35:14.083
Go!

35:26.040 --> 35:27.234
Freeze!

35:27.642 --> 35:28.870
Raise your hands!

35:31.813 --> 35:34.043
Excuse me. Can l get through here?

35:34.415 --> 35:36.110
Go back to your room, lady.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.225
-Nice shooting, Ma!
-Thanks, baby.

35:46.594 --> 35:47.959
l'll call you back.

35:48.129 --> 35:49.426
Stay here!

36:20.328 --> 36:21.522
Bruno, enough!

36:22.163 --> 36:24.154
Rowland, it's Pluto.

36:24.332 --> 36:26.493
l got to get to the Far Side.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.692
l need you to get me a spacesuit.

36:29.337 --> 36:32.602
Make that two spacesuits.
One for a female about 5'7''.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.536
l'll tell you when l get there.

36:50.825 --> 36:53.350
-This is Dina.
-Nice to meet you.

36:53.594 --> 36:54.583
Hi. Thanks.

36:54.662 --> 36:56.323
l'm getting ready to leave town.

36:56.397 --> 36:58.592
How will you get to the Far Side?
Walk there?

36:58.666 --> 37:01.635
l got that covered.
l'm arranging for some transportation.

37:02.937 --> 37:04.234
That's it.

37:07.174 --> 37:11.042
-Code generator serial number?
-8-7-4-3-5-0-8.

37:11.379 --> 37:12.573
Check.

37:23.691 --> 37:27.457
lt's not my business, but why don't we
just rent a car instead of stealing one?

37:27.561 --> 37:29.188
Because you can't rent these.

37:29.263 --> 37:33.632
-What's so special about it?
-lt's a Chrysler DeSoto S-5000.

37:33.701 --> 37:37.865
lt cruises on a 14-inch cushion of air,
hikes up to 64 inches in rough terrain.

37:37.939 --> 37:41.272
lt's heat and meteor resistant,
with a torque compressor power thrust...

37:41.342 --> 37:43.105
...and a kick-ass sound system.

37:43.878 --> 37:46.472
Trust me on this one.
Bruno, l need an ignition chip.

37:49.917 --> 37:51.441
This might do the trick.

37:52.987 --> 37:54.318
lt will work perfect.

37:54.388 --> 37:58.085
Got to love a place where your bodyguard
and car have interchangeable parts.

38:00.962 --> 38:03.430
Smart-ass. After you.

38:16.477 --> 38:20.777
Good evening, Mr. Vandervoort.
James here. Aren't you early, sir?

38:22.383 --> 38:26.547
We're surprising Mrs. Vandervoort
with some jam and scones...

38:26.620 --> 38:29.316
...and picking her up
at a spa on the Far Side.

38:29.490 --> 38:31.515
You're not Mr. Vandervoort at all.

38:31.592 --> 38:34.220
You're some hooligan
trying to steal his motorcar.

38:34.295 --> 38:35.626
l won't have it!

38:35.696 --> 38:38.028
Shut up and drive. Head for the Far Side.

38:38.099 --> 38:41.865
l'll give you to the count of three
before l alert the authorities. One.

38:41.936 --> 38:45.463
Sorry, James. You're too late.
l have disconnected your alarm relay.

38:48.909 --> 38:53.209
So get moving, Jimmy boy,
or you'll have a speech impediment.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.178
Good God, l'm being stolen!

39:24.378 --> 39:25.936
Take over for a while, James.

39:26.113 --> 39:28.843
l will not be an accomplice in this.

39:28.916 --> 39:31.578
You're not an accomplice,
you're a hostage. Do it.

39:31.652 --> 39:33.916
-l won't be intimidated.
-Do it!

39:33.988 --> 39:34.977
All right.

39:35.389 --> 39:36.686
Thank you.

39:37.992 --> 39:39.357
Nice work, James.

39:39.527 --> 39:42.121
Yeah, James. You little asshole.

39:42.396 --> 39:43.454
l heard that.

39:43.864 --> 39:46.833
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.

39:47.435 --> 39:50.199
Hey, listen,
l won't let anything happen to you.

39:50.938 --> 39:52.166
l promise.

39:56.510 --> 39:57.670
All right.

39:58.212 --> 40:00.407
How long does the night last up here?

40:00.848 --> 40:01.837
Two weeks.

40:02.216 --> 40:06.209
-That's so depressing.
-No, it's not. lt's nice. Look at this.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.288
When l was a little boy,
l used to come out here with Rowland...

40:16.363 --> 40:19.560
...look up and count the stars,
and dream about what was out there.

40:19.633 --> 40:22.500
l never heard such drivel in my life!

40:23.437 --> 40:25.769
What kind of refreshments
you got back here?

40:25.873 --> 40:28.933
Dreadfully sorry, sir.
We weren't expecting anyone.

40:29.143 --> 40:32.340
l know you got something.
You going to make me house it?

40:36.250 --> 40:38.047
Champagne and caviar!

40:38.219 --> 40:40.449
Don't touch those, they're for guests!

40:40.521 --> 40:42.580
James, we are guests.

40:47.495 --> 40:50.055
He'll get her drunk
and have his way with her.

40:50.264 --> 40:51.822
You know something?

40:56.604 --> 40:59.198
Bad luck, old boy!

41:26.800 --> 41:29.234
We were ambushed?

41:29.637 --> 41:31.264
-Ambushed?
-Yes, sir.

41:31.472 --> 41:34.839
Really? Well, they're just not playing fair.

41:35.042 --> 41:40.036
Any other excuses? Problems at home,
cold coming on, work too stressful? What?

41:40.147 --> 41:41.808
-Nothing, sir.
-Good.

41:41.982 --> 41:45.474
Because the next time l talk to Rex Crater,
l need to say Nash is dead.

41:45.553 --> 41:48.147
-That's all he wants to hear.
-lt's as good as done.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.688
Or else you are.

41:51.225 --> 41:52.419
Get out of here.

41:54.195 --> 41:55.924
We'll get right on it, sir.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.773
Where are we?

42:13.948 --> 42:16.473
Safe. lt's an old prospecting dome.

42:16.717 --> 42:19.550
We found it years back.
Nobody knows about it but me and Bruno.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.991
What's the temperature out here?

42:31.365 --> 42:33.299
lt's about 200 below.

42:33.467 --> 42:34.832
Balmy.

43:02.062 --> 43:04.496
Play's over. Get down here.

43:04.832 --> 43:05.992
Okay.

43:17.678 --> 43:19.339
That was fun.

43:33.894 --> 43:37.796
Memories.
Had a lot of memories in here, Bruno.

43:38.732 --> 43:40.290
Look at all this junk.

43:40.534 --> 43:43.697
What do you mean ''junk''?
This is called inventory.

43:44.038 --> 43:47.474
Show a little respect.
This is what's left of my life's work.

44:09.296 --> 44:11.321
Very interesting help you have around here.

44:11.398 --> 44:13.866
That's an old program l forgot to delete.

44:14.134 --> 44:17.228
Left it on ''Oops! ''
l forgot that was in there.

44:28.315 --> 44:29.646
Miss me?

44:30.084 --> 44:31.574
Guess not.

44:32.619 --> 44:37.420
She's an excellent piece
of multi-functional software.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.591
lnitiate search.

44:41.762 --> 44:45.960
Convicted organized crime,
Earthling, initials WZW.

44:46.767 --> 44:47.756
WZW.

44:49.470 --> 44:50.869
No WZW.

44:51.538 --> 44:56.271
Nothing. Thank you.
Thanks for nothing. Worthless computer.

44:56.477 --> 44:57.603
How's it going?

44:57.678 --> 44:59.475
lt's not going at all.

45:00.180 --> 45:01.613
Babette made lunch.

45:01.882 --> 45:03.975
Thank you. Thank you so much.

45:05.419 --> 45:07.284
Can l help?

45:07.521 --> 45:10.388
Computer's got no information
on our mystery man.

45:10.557 --> 45:13.788
l'm starting to think
that that Zimmer conned us.

45:14.294 --> 45:18.230
Here's your problem.
Zimmer said WZW, not MZM.

45:18.465 --> 45:20.695
You're just looking at it upside--

45:21.001 --> 45:22.559
Wait a minute.

45:25.372 --> 45:28.500
You did it! Look at you! You're a genius!

45:28.876 --> 45:31.868
Look what you did.
She saw it upside down.

45:32.479 --> 45:33.912
Watch this.

45:35.115 --> 45:39.984
lnitiate search. Convicted organized crime,
Earthling, initials MZM.

45:45.325 --> 45:48.351
Okay. You see? Now we have something.

45:48.495 --> 45:50.622
Open file 10-1 7 MM.

45:52.266 --> 45:54.700
How do you feel about your acquittal,
Mr. Marucci?

45:54.768 --> 45:58.329
Makes me proud to live in this great
country where justice is still served.

45:58.405 --> 46:01.670
With gambling to be outlawed on Earth,
will the Giovanetto syndicate...

46:01.742 --> 46:05.234
...engender a consortium to perpetuate
a new gambling coalition on the Moon?

46:05.312 --> 46:08.110
Will the what do what to the what?
Speak English, sweetheart.

46:08.182 --> 46:11.242
Will you and the other major
organized crime figures on Earth--

46:11.518 --> 46:15.352
Organized crime?
l don't know nobody in organized crime.

46:17.090 --> 46:18.421
Listen, darling...

46:18.492 --> 46:21.461
...you want to ask me a question,
let's sit down somewhere.

46:21.528 --> 46:24.361
We'll open a bottle of wine,
get to know each other better.

46:24.431 --> 46:26.626
Get a new dress, a nice pair of shoes.

46:26.700 --> 46:28.964
Be at my hotel around 7:00.

46:30.103 --> 46:32.731
What are you waiting for, a dance?

46:37.778 --> 46:39.803
l forgot the stairs were there.

46:43.283 --> 46:44.614
Back it up.

46:46.753 --> 46:49.381
Let me take it in a little closer here.

46:50.123 --> 46:52.023
And closer still.

46:52.693 --> 46:54.183
What do you see?

46:55.062 --> 46:57.758
So Mike Marucci is Rex Crater?

46:59.666 --> 47:00.894
One way to find out.

47:01.435 --> 47:03.960
That's pretty far-fetched, Pluto.

47:04.471 --> 47:06.166
But l buy it.

47:06.907 --> 47:09.535
Marucci had the bucks, he had the balls.

47:09.610 --> 47:12.135
He had the background
to build Moon Beach.

47:12.446 --> 47:15.813
Not to mention he wouldn't mind
whacking anybody who got in his way.

47:15.883 --> 47:17.214
So l noticed.

47:17.351 --> 47:21.082
Pluto, when you make an enemy,
you don't mess around.

47:21.922 --> 47:23.321
Yeah, you know me.

47:23.657 --> 47:26.683
l'm gonna see an old buddy at the FBl,
l'll get back to you.

47:26.793 --> 47:27.782
Right.

47:30.831 --> 47:34.597
Listen to that! That's Connecticut.
Listen how clear.

47:34.935 --> 47:35.924
What's this?

47:36.904 --> 47:41.500
No, don't do that! Stop!
That's a cryogenic Chihuahua!

47:42.776 --> 47:43.868
lt's a real dog?

47:43.944 --> 47:47.072
Yeah, it's very delicate.
You know it's illegal to bring pets here.

47:47.147 --> 47:50.776
But l got a friend back in Juarez
who knows how to freeze-dry these things.

47:50.851 --> 47:52.375
Look at that. lt's a girl.

47:52.786 --> 47:56.381
Pop that little bitch in the particle wave
for two minutes on defrost...

47:56.623 --> 47:58.614
...she'll be running around the room.

47:58.792 --> 48:01.420
l used to get $5,000 a pop for these things.

48:02.396 --> 48:04.296
Where'd you do your singing back Earth?

48:04.464 --> 48:07.433
Weddings, bar mitzvahs,
reincarnation rituals.

48:07.501 --> 48:10.299
The usual gigs. l hit a rut...

48:10.370 --> 48:15.103
...so l sent my tape to a club l heard about
up here. Figured, what the hell?

48:15.642 --> 48:18.372
They sent me a one-way ticket.

48:18.445 --> 48:20.777
But when l got here,
the place had been sold.

48:22.583 --> 48:26.246
l checked the water tanks.
We have enough to stay here for months.

48:26.420 --> 48:27.648
What about food?

48:27.721 --> 48:28.710
Plenty.

48:28.789 --> 48:31.883
Let's have a dinner party.
Let's change the mood in this place.

48:32.292 --> 48:33.657
All right.

48:35.562 --> 48:38.463
He seems a little.... Does he get angry?

48:38.532 --> 48:42.525
No. He has a happiness chip
l had installed. That's why he's always....

48:44.471 --> 48:47.599
-Does he mind when you make fun of him?
-No, the happiness chip.

48:47.674 --> 48:50.905
l wish l had a happiness chip
in my ass so l'd always be happy.

48:51.578 --> 48:55.344
Has one-sixth gravity been giving you
chronic back pain?

48:55.415 --> 49:00.512
We at the Lunar Lumbar Clinic specialize
in replacing the lumbar vertebrae...

49:00.587 --> 49:04.216
...with our patented
epoxy spinal substitute.

49:06.193 --> 49:09.026
You see,
once Dr. Pedanken was murdered...

49:09.229 --> 49:12.062
...there's no link
to prove a Marucci clone ever existed!

49:12.132 --> 49:16.091
-Please, after we eat, okay?
-Now l got to buy you dinner, too?

49:19.773 --> 49:21.240
l'll tell you, Jack...

49:21.308 --> 49:24.869
...detective work was a lot easier
before they invented cloning.

49:25.078 --> 49:27.638
At least you knew who your friends were.

49:40.827 --> 49:43.261
Who is that?
Nobody even has this number.

49:44.598 --> 49:46.657
-Ma!
-Pluto!

49:46.733 --> 49:49.497
Get off this line.
What if somebody is tracing this call?

49:49.569 --> 49:53.369
Pluto, Rowland is dead!
They found him murdered.

49:55.075 --> 49:58.511
How could they do this?
l can't believe this.

49:59.813 --> 50:03.579
Pluto, please get off the Moon!
They're going to kill you, too.

50:03.984 --> 50:05.178
Did you hear me?

50:05.252 --> 50:08.050
l got some business
to take care of. l'll be back in touch.

50:08.755 --> 50:09.619
Pluto.

50:09.923 --> 50:11.185
Bruno!

50:11.491 --> 50:13.857
-Come on!
-Yes, boss!

50:14.127 --> 50:15.958
They killed Rowland!

50:16.630 --> 50:21.260
You know why? We came too close
to the truth. lt's time to confront Marucci!

50:21.435 --> 50:23.995
-We better wear protection.
-You'll be safe here.

50:24.071 --> 50:25.561
You're leaving me behind?

50:26.840 --> 50:30.298
-What is that?
-Recreational vehicle approaching.

50:43.957 --> 50:46.517
Let's get it right this time, okay?

50:53.200 --> 50:55.532
Registered to Lunar Grand Hotel.

50:55.602 --> 50:58.867
-What the hell is that?
-l'd put on my spacesuit if l were you.

51:09.149 --> 51:10.878
l count five of them.

51:10.951 --> 51:15.115
Four with 43-K Magnums
and one Scorpion rocket launcher.

51:15.188 --> 51:18.180
-lnitiate countermeasures!
-There are no countermeasures.

51:18.325 --> 51:22.193
-Break out all the assault weapons!
-We sold them, remember?

51:22.496 --> 51:25.431
Where's that big-ass street sweeper
with the supercharger?

51:25.499 --> 51:27.023
lt's at your mom's.

51:27.200 --> 51:29.691
Great! What are we going to do?

51:30.403 --> 51:31.495
Bathroom!

51:31.671 --> 51:33.400
-Bathroom?
-Yeah, come on!

51:33.573 --> 51:35.871
Babette, secure yourself!

51:44.785 --> 51:46.275
Bruno, hold us down!

52:29.529 --> 52:31.520
Johnson, stay with me.

52:31.698 --> 52:34.599
You three, go in and make sure we got him.

52:38.338 --> 52:39.669
Where are you going?

52:58.992 --> 52:59.924
Get back!

53:04.731 --> 53:05.720
Come here!

53:05.899 --> 53:08.595
-What are you doing?
-Saving your ass!

53:21.047 --> 53:22.036
Shit!

53:22.415 --> 53:23.848
Johnson, behind you!

53:39.165 --> 53:40.462
Goddamn it!

53:54.481 --> 53:55.971
Stay with me!

54:13.667 --> 54:14.861
James, open up!

54:28.515 --> 54:29.504
Bruno!

54:29.582 --> 54:31.209
Bruno!

54:31.551 --> 54:32.711
Let's go!

54:57.444 --> 55:01.141
-How did they find us?
-Obviously you did something stupid.

55:22.535 --> 55:23.559
That's good.

55:25.538 --> 55:26.334
Hold it.

55:26.740 --> 55:28.002
Engage power thrust, now!

55:28.074 --> 55:30.201
Why don't you just give yourself up?

55:33.947 --> 55:37.713
-Engage the power thrust right now!
-Power thrust engaged.

55:59.806 --> 56:01.603
We lost them. We're good to go now.

56:01.674 --> 56:04.837
Who's going to pay for the damage
to the vehicle...

56:04.911 --> 56:07.209
...not to mention the caviar
and champagne?

56:07.280 --> 56:08.508
l'll send you a check.

56:13.753 --> 56:14.651
Shit!

56:19.025 --> 56:21.084
-Ram them.
-What?

56:21.161 --> 56:22.185
Ram them!

56:28.668 --> 56:29.896
Stay on them.

56:31.204 --> 56:32.136
Okay!

56:45.752 --> 56:47.049
Go, go, go!

56:58.832 --> 57:00.857
Die, die, Pluto Nash.

57:03.369 --> 57:04.734
-l'm hit!
-Quiet!

57:04.904 --> 57:05.871
l'm hit!

57:08.408 --> 57:10.273
Bruno, you see that rill right there?

57:11.044 --> 57:12.602
No rills, please!

57:12.979 --> 57:15.072
lt's a clear approach and a perfect lip!

57:15.148 --> 57:17.241
-What's a rill?
-That's a rill!

57:22.155 --> 57:23.622
Pluto.

57:24.924 --> 57:26.983
-Are you crazy?
-Hold on!

57:27.861 --> 57:29.192
Say when, Bruno!

57:29.362 --> 57:31.159
Three, two, one...

57:31.498 --> 57:32.362
...go!

57:40.874 --> 57:41.841
Stop, stop!

58:13.973 --> 58:16.567
That's why they call us rill-hoppers.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.734
l think l'm going to be sick.

58:20.647 --> 58:22.581
Evacuate! Evacuate!

58:22.715 --> 58:23.875
Put your helmet on!

58:23.950 --> 58:25.178
-Why?
-Hurry, get it on!

58:25.251 --> 58:26.377
Where are you going?

58:26.452 --> 58:28.750
-Overboard, brother.
-lt's been real, James.

58:28.821 --> 58:32.257
Great, so l'll just sit here
and blow up, shall l?

58:37.897 --> 58:40.127
-Can we go home now?
-No!

58:40.366 --> 58:41.628
Get us to the other side.

58:50.176 --> 58:51.165
All right.

58:51.978 --> 58:56.915
Even if they bailed out before the explosion,
they still couldn't survive out here, right?

59:00.186 --> 59:00.982
Let's go.

59:01.588 --> 59:04.250
Excuse me, could you give me a lift?

59:04.424 --> 59:08.190
l have some information
about the people that you're looking for.

59:09.329 --> 59:13.493
Come back here!
l can help you find them, you bastards!

59:15.768 --> 59:17.167
What do we do now?

59:17.470 --> 59:18.732
We start walking.

59:19.305 --> 59:21.102
We don't have any food or water.

59:21.374 --> 59:25.208
We'll run out of air long before
we need food and water. Trust me.

01:00:03.983 --> 01:00:07.419
-l can't breathe.
-Come on, Dina, hang in there.

01:00:11.624 --> 01:00:12.989
Hang in there.

01:00:17.497 --> 01:00:18.657
Dina.

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:20.161
Dina.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:33.345
Boss.

01:00:59.272 --> 01:01:00.603
Boss...

01:01:01.808 --> 01:01:03.639
...battery...

01:01:04.711 --> 01:01:06.201
...low.

01:01:42.315 --> 01:01:43.805
Shit!

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.697
-Stay down or you'll pass out again.
-Okay.

01:02:05.004 --> 01:02:06.767
You on a nature walk or something?

01:02:06.839 --> 01:02:10.331
No, the thrusters on my vehicle blew out.

01:02:11.844 --> 01:02:13.675
What's going on? Where are we?

01:02:13.746 --> 01:02:16.510
lt's okay. l just rescued you.
My name is Felix Laranga.

01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:19.215
Felix, l'm Pluto and that's Dina.

01:02:19.385 --> 01:02:20.374
Pluto?

01:02:20.686 --> 01:02:22.779
-Pluto Nash?
-Yeah.

01:02:23.489 --> 01:02:24.956
The Pluto Nash?

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.147
Yeah.

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:28.486
Get out of here, l'm your number one fan!

01:02:28.795 --> 01:02:31.320
You're the reason
l got into the smuggling business.

01:02:31.397 --> 01:02:35.891
Honey, let me tell you something.
This man is the Tito Puente of rill-hopping.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:38.562
Right here, this is the guy.

01:02:39.205 --> 01:02:43.301
Could you bring my robot inside?
He needs to be recharged.

01:02:46.312 --> 01:02:50.442
Well, look, l had
a really bad robot experience once.

01:02:51.217 --> 01:02:54.914
l had this fine robot mamita
and l rented her out...

01:02:55.154 --> 01:02:58.681
...took her back to my place,
we started getting busy.

01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:03.395
All of a sudden, there's a malfunction,
and bam! She does a Terminator on me.

01:03:03.896 --> 01:03:07.491
Busted a couple of my ribs,
dislocated my shoulder.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.395
l'm lucky l'm still alive.

01:03:09.735 --> 01:03:12.169
Don't worry about Bruno,
he's not going to hurt you.

01:03:12.805 --> 01:03:15.171
As long as you don't try
to get busy with him.

01:03:16.175 --> 01:03:20.373
Ordinarily, l'd say no.
But for Pluto Nash, l'll do anything.

01:03:20.713 --> 01:03:22.340
l appreciate it.

01:03:22.515 --> 01:03:25.382
You think you might be able
to give us a ride to Moon Beach?

01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:28.745
Bro, l'll take you to Miami Beach
if that's where you got to go.

01:03:28.821 --> 01:03:30.015
l'll be right back.

01:04:04.123 --> 01:04:05.920
Check it out.

01:04:06.158 --> 01:04:10.618
Lunar Grand Casino dice,
loaded and 100.%. undetectable.

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:14.256
You want a set, as a personal gift from me?

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.298
Thanks, but l'm not really a big gambler.

01:04:17.436 --> 01:04:19.870
With those dice, you ain't gambling.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:22.772
We're not going to gamble.
Thanks, but no, thanks.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:27.238
lf you're not a gambler,
why are you going to Moon Beach?

01:04:27.313 --> 01:04:30.146
-l'm going to see an old friend of mine.
-Who's that?

01:04:30.316 --> 01:04:31.442
Rex Crater.

01:04:32.251 --> 01:04:34.344
Rex Crater is a friend of yours?

01:04:34.587 --> 01:04:35.849
Yeah, sure.

01:04:36.022 --> 01:04:39.389
Can you comp me a suite
with a sunken living room bathtub...

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:42.256
...and a waterbed
with a mirror on the ceiling?

01:04:43.262 --> 01:04:44.490
Yeah, probably.

01:04:45.264 --> 01:04:46.424
Damn!

01:04:46.766 --> 01:04:49.428
Pluto Nash is down with Rex Crater.

01:05:05.785 --> 01:05:07.946
You know what, Felix?

01:05:10.356 --> 01:05:13.450
Take these Hillarys.
We appreciate your helping us out.

01:05:13.526 --> 01:05:15.756
No, you my man. You don't got to do that.

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:18.388
Take this, you helped us out.
l appreciate it.

01:05:18.564 --> 01:05:20.532
l'm all right. l'll tell you what.

01:05:20.967 --> 01:05:23.435
-Would you sign my helmet for me?
-Get out of here.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:26.437
-Come on, give me an autograph.
-Are you serious?

01:05:26.505 --> 01:05:29.599
lt's not every day l get to hang out
with Pluto Nash.

01:05:30.743 --> 01:05:32.677
-Please.
-Okay, l'll sign it.

01:05:32.912 --> 01:05:34.777
This is my first autograph.

01:05:35.047 --> 01:05:37.106
What do you want me to sign?

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.340
''To Felix...

01:05:39.418 --> 01:05:44.378
''...my buddy, who stuck with me through
thick and thin, who l'll never forget.''

01:05:46.592 --> 01:05:48.753
Bro, l just saved your life.

01:05:48.928 --> 01:05:53.092
''My buddy, who stuck with me
through thick and thin, and saved my ass.

01:05:53.466 --> 01:05:55.559
''Peace and love, Pluto Nash.''

01:05:57.269 --> 01:06:00.033
What's all that stuff you got
on the rack back there?

01:06:00.106 --> 01:06:03.405
That's a new shipment of stuff
l just smuggled in from Puerto Rico.

01:06:03.576 --> 01:06:04.702
ls that right?

01:06:04.777 --> 01:06:07.974
Top of the line, designer labels.
Why, you need something?

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:09.708
Yeah, we could use some clothes.

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:18.220
Welcome to Moon Beach
and the Lunar Grand Hotel...

01:06:18.591 --> 01:06:21.355
...where luck is always on your side.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:27.563
Welcome to Moon Beach
and the Lunar Grand Hotel...

01:06:27.933 --> 01:06:30.697
...where luck is always on your side.

01:06:36.942 --> 01:06:39.809
Bruno, lay low for a minute.
Go get a magazine or something.

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.172
Meet us over by the elevators.

01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:49.050
Hey, good-looking, how about slipping up
to your room and playing with me awhile?

01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:52.655
Don't you want to do something
exciting tonight?

01:06:52.725 --> 01:06:53.749
No!

01:06:55.728 --> 01:06:58.128
Afraid you might get lucky?

01:07:07.807 --> 01:07:08.796
Hello.

01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:10.831
Good evening. Checking in?

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:13.037
Actually, we're here to see Tony Francis.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:15.012
The early show or the late show?

01:07:15.214 --> 01:07:19.173
We're old friends. We come to see him
in person. Where's his dressing room?

01:07:19.485 --> 01:07:21.009
l can't tell you that, sir.

01:07:21.187 --> 01:07:22.484
Really?

01:07:23.189 --> 01:07:26.556
Tell you what, just give us a room
and two tickets to the early show.

01:07:27.259 --> 01:07:30.319
All set. Just give me a thumb print
for the charges.

01:07:32.598 --> 01:07:34.293
l'll pay in cash.

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:38.467
Cash is always easier.

01:07:40.506 --> 01:07:42.872
Mr. Francis' show is black tie.

01:07:43.342 --> 01:07:45.742
We have rentals available
from the concierge.

01:07:46.011 --> 01:07:48.241
All prettied up for Tony? Absolutely.

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.947
Peekaboo, l found you. Come on, big boy...

01:07:55.187 --> 01:07:58.156
...right here in the lobby! Oh, baby!

01:07:58.824 --> 01:08:00.485
You sick bastard!

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.091
Security!

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:06.764
All set.

01:08:08.033 --> 01:08:09.364
Enjoy your stay.

01:08:09.969 --> 01:08:12.130
Crazy-ass Tony!

01:08:14.807 --> 01:08:16.434
All right. So far, so good.

01:08:16.742 --> 01:08:17.731
Come with us.

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.471
-What's the problem?
-ls he with you?

01:08:20.813 --> 01:08:23.611
Yes, he's my old friend from West Virginia.
What's going on?

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:25.508
Nice try.

01:08:25.885 --> 01:08:30.015
After you've paid for the damages
to this slot machine, we'll give Earl back.

01:08:30.089 --> 01:08:32.716
-Wait a second--
-Here's your claim check.

01:08:32.792 --> 01:08:34.760
Pick your robot up when you leave.

01:08:34.993 --> 01:08:36.154
Let's go.

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:38.328
Sorry, boss.

01:08:39.564 --> 01:08:42.500
You're not a robot, you're an animal!

01:08:43.402 --> 01:08:44.868
Line it up!

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.468
Yo, baby, you love me?
'Cause l love me, too!

01:08:52.845 --> 01:08:54.278
Come here, baby!

01:08:54.613 --> 01:08:57.639
l want bottles of champagne
for those people over there....

01:09:04.023 --> 01:09:06.423
You ready? Blow!

01:09:10.162 --> 01:09:12.288
Yo, Pluto! My man, Pluto Nash!

01:09:12.363 --> 01:09:13.956
Pluto Nash, come on!

01:09:15.334 --> 01:09:18.201
Come here, Pluto.
l want to show you how to win big time!

01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:22.764
Pluto, where are you going? Come on!
They're giving away $1,000 chips!

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:24.433
Come here!

01:09:26.612 --> 01:09:29.911
Mr. Belcher, Nash just walked in the lobby.

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:33.515
Nash is alive.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.312
You idiots!

01:09:39.191 --> 01:09:40.953
All day, all day!

01:09:41.026 --> 01:09:42.720
Watch this, honey!

01:09:44.363 --> 01:09:45.921
Want a sip of champagne?

01:09:49.033 --> 01:09:49.796
Let's go.

01:09:49.868 --> 01:09:53.669
Give me those back.
Get your hands off me or l'll have you fired.

01:09:53.738 --> 01:09:56.469
You know who l am? Felix Laranga!

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:57.533
Who?

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.703
You never heard of me
'cause you're stupid.

01:10:12.157 --> 01:10:16.594
Ladies and gentlemen,
the undisputed master of the universe...

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:19.256
...Mr. Tony Francis!

01:10:48.527 --> 01:10:52.429
What an amazing act.
He's so different, so original.

01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:53.720
Yeah.

01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:01.537
What makes you so sure he'll help us out?

01:11:01.607 --> 01:11:04.440
He'll help us.
He couldn't sing a note if it weren't for me.

01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:06.535
You taught Tony Francis how to sing?

01:11:06.745 --> 01:11:10.203
No, l convinced a bookie
not to pour some acid down his throat.

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:30.561
Pack your bags,
l'm taking you home with me!

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:33.329
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:33.405 --> 01:11:36.272
Please welcome the master
of musical disaster...

01:11:36.342 --> 01:11:39.004
...Ted Jefferies
and the Ted Jefferies Orchestra.

01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:44.542
Hit it, maestro!

01:11:56.595 --> 01:11:59.155
There's a guy over there checking faces.

01:12:01.967 --> 01:12:03.332
Turn towards me.

01:12:15.381 --> 01:12:17.281
Okay, l think that worked.

01:12:21.153 --> 01:12:22.711
lt worked for me.

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:33.364
You were so wonderful, Tony.
What a great show!

01:12:33.999 --> 01:12:36.365
lt was a magnificent evening, wasn't it?

01:12:36.735 --> 01:12:38.862
ls this the refund window?

01:12:40.506 --> 01:12:44.772
Pluto Nash! My goodness, it's marvelous
to see you! How have you been?

01:12:44.843 --> 01:12:46.708
l'll tell you about it. This is Dina.

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:49.441
-l loved your show.
-Tony loves you for loving his show.

01:12:49.515 --> 01:12:51.881
l want you to meet my wives,
Gina and Filomena.

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:54.714
A pleasure to meet you, Pluto and Dina.

01:12:56.422 --> 01:12:58.583
My man, Anthony Frankowski!

01:12:58.824 --> 01:13:02.590
-lt's Francis, not Frankowski.
-Your wives don't know you're Polish?

01:13:02.694 --> 01:13:06.755
-Nobody knows. You'll blow my cover.
-All right, it's our little secret.

01:13:06.832 --> 01:13:08.459
You want to stay for dinner?

01:13:08.534 --> 01:13:13.471
We made osso buco and pork and gnocchi,
all Tony's mother's recipes.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.300
No, thanks, we ate already.

01:13:17.109 --> 01:13:19.634
-You're a freak.
-You have no idea.

01:13:20.412 --> 01:13:22.505
Can l talk to you in private?

01:13:22.748 --> 01:13:25.410
Absolutely.
Would you excuse us for a minute?

01:13:25.784 --> 01:13:26.614
Sure!

01:13:26.952 --> 01:13:28.385
You married twins?

01:13:28.454 --> 01:13:31.753
They're not twins. l met the perfect woman
and l had her cloned.

01:13:32.024 --> 01:13:34.185
-Which one is which?
-Who cares?

01:13:35.227 --> 01:13:38.754
Me and your boss, Rex Crater,
we had a little misunderstanding.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.560
What kind of misunderstanding?

01:13:40.632 --> 01:13:43.100
He tried to have me killed
and he blew up my club.

01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:45.227
-How do you know it was Crater?
-l know it.

01:13:45.304 --> 01:13:48.569
He offered to buy my club
and l wouldn't sell it, so they blew it up.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.368
Shit.

01:13:49.441 --> 01:13:51.102
You got to help me get to Crater.

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:55.044
-Babe, l'm fond of breathing, you dig?
-Just tell me how to get to him.

01:13:55.214 --> 01:13:58.445
l never even met him! He watches
my show from up in his penthouse.

01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:02.749
He sends down these messages:
''Your jokes suck. You walk like a peacock.''

01:14:02.821 --> 01:14:05.312
You wouldn't be singing
if it wasn't for me, right?

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:08.117
Come on, man.

01:14:10.162 --> 01:14:13.063
l might know a way for you
to get up into his penthouse.

01:14:13.132 --> 01:14:16.158
-After that you're on your own, Pluto.
-Thanks.

01:14:16.335 --> 01:14:19.702
Pick up Bruno and pay the damages
on that slot machine.

01:14:19.771 --> 01:14:22.899
Rent a car and wait outside
the front entrance of the hotel.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:24.736
l might have to make a fast getaway.

01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:28.143
-But what if you don't get away?
-l always get away.

01:14:28.647 --> 01:14:30.672
Come on, we'll go this way.

01:14:33.285 --> 01:14:36.345
Rex Crater's private penthouse elevator
is right next to mine.

01:14:36.421 --> 01:14:40.357
There's a way for you
to get from my elevator into his.

01:14:42.661 --> 01:14:43.525
How you doing?

01:14:43.595 --> 01:14:45.995
Trust me, you'll love this.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.636
All right, here we go.
l'll stop this so nobody bothers us.

01:15:07.686 --> 01:15:10.484
-l gotta get that later.
-Shit!

01:15:10.556 --> 01:15:13.320
That's Rex's elevator down there. See?

01:15:13.425 --> 01:15:15.985
lt only stops at the subbasement
and his penthouse.

01:15:16.061 --> 01:15:18.222
My elevator only goes as low as this floor.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:20.861
How do l get from one elevator
to the other one?

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:24.528
That's what Tony is here to help you with.
l'll tell you the whole thing.

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:29.404
Back up as far as you can go,
get a good running start, jump out across.

01:15:30.809 --> 01:15:34.802
-Jump across to what?
-The ledge! See that ledge down there?

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:38.314
Grab onto these wires
and swing down onto the ledge.

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:41.348
-You want me to grab hot wires?
-How do you know they're hot?

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.546
Look, the shit is hot!

01:15:42.721 --> 01:15:46.782
Grab the ones that aren't hot.
Swing down, get down to the ledge.

01:15:46.858 --> 01:15:51.295
Then you wait an hour and a half
till they bring Rex's late supper up to him.

01:15:51.363 --> 01:15:54.764
When the elevator goes by,
before it passes you, you jump on top.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.829
Use this casino chip to unscrew
the trapdoor on top of the elevator.

01:15:58.904 --> 01:16:02.897
Jump down inside and take out
the two robot guards, pop-pop!

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:06.741
Boom! You're alone in the elevator,
you got a meeting with Rex.

01:16:10.682 --> 01:16:12.309
What's plan B?

01:16:14.786 --> 01:16:16.378
This is Plan B.

01:16:17.456 --> 01:16:20.254
l'm here to accept Mr. Crater's offer.

01:16:20.325 --> 01:16:23.658
-ls that right?
-lt's all settled. $10 million.

01:16:25.864 --> 01:16:30.460
-We'll have to get back to you on that.
-l got to get ready for my next show.

01:16:31.436 --> 01:16:32.494
Get them out of here.

01:16:33.538 --> 01:16:36.132
Sorry, your robot remains property
of this casino...

01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:39.143
...until the damages
to our slot machines are taken care of.

01:16:39.211 --> 01:16:40.803
l'm here to pay you.

01:16:41.613 --> 01:16:43.604
Repairs hasn't sent down a bill yet.

01:16:44.716 --> 01:16:48.948
You would be a real peach
if you could get me that bill.

01:16:56.361 --> 01:16:58.625
Harry, l got a Bruno '63 Deluxe.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:01.723
Wrecked a slot machine.
Owner wants to pick him up.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:02.858
How much they owe?

01:17:02.934 --> 01:17:05.630
l haven't even looked
at the damn thing yet.

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:07.501
Have him check with us tomorrow morning.

01:17:07.572 --> 01:17:09.039
What are they saying?

01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:11.675
You'll be spending the night.

01:17:12.311 --> 01:17:14.108
lt's been fun.

01:17:21.753 --> 01:17:23.152
Excuse me.

01:17:27.259 --> 01:17:30.023
-l got to take a leak.
-Robots don't take leaks.

01:17:32.864 --> 01:17:34.525
You're absolutely right.

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:37.223
Come on.

01:17:38.370 --> 01:17:40.201
We need to get a car.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:45.399
What are you in such a hurry for?

01:17:52.718 --> 01:17:55.050
You wanted to talk to Mr. Crater?

01:17:55.687 --> 01:17:56.676
Here you are.

01:18:02.994 --> 01:18:05.554
l finally get to meet the great Rex Crater?

01:18:05.864 --> 01:18:07.456
Or is it Mike Marucci?

01:18:07.799 --> 01:18:09.426
Yeah, Mike Marucci.

01:18:09.501 --> 01:18:12.061
Thought you were so damn smart,
l figured you out.

01:18:12.404 --> 01:18:15.896
l should come over there
and put my foot in your fat grease-ball ass.

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:29.610
So you got it all figured out, huh?

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:49.634
lt is a pleasure to meet me.

01:18:50.108 --> 01:18:52.099
l'm pretty feisty, huh?

01:18:52.677 --> 01:18:54.611
What's this, a rented tuxedo?

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.346
You know, you're old enough
to own your own tuxedo.

01:18:57.416 --> 01:19:00.249
Sit down! You know,
you should be honored.

01:19:00.852 --> 01:19:04.344
Only person besides yourself
to ever come up here is Belcher over there.

01:19:06.725 --> 01:19:08.090
What's going on here?

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.652
Remember when they cut your appendix
out eight years ago in prison?

01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:15.364
Gambling had just been outlawed on Earth,
so my old boss...

01:19:15.434 --> 01:19:19.996
...Mike Marucci, commissioned
Dr. Runa Pedanken to create a clone...

01:19:20.071 --> 01:19:22.869
...of someone
who knew their way around the Moon.

01:19:23.275 --> 01:19:24.207
For what?

01:19:24.276 --> 01:19:28.508
He was starting a gambling operation
and needed someone to front for him.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.110
Someone intelligent, that he could control.

01:19:31.583 --> 01:19:32.641
A puppet.

01:19:33.518 --> 01:19:38.615
That didn't jive with my career plan
so l sent Marucci and Pedanken into orbit.

01:19:39.524 --> 01:19:43.016
Then, for sentimental reasons,
or because l'm a nice guy, l let you live.

01:19:44.329 --> 01:19:46.320
Until you got in my way.

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.895
Let's face it, why should l keep you around?

01:19:50.969 --> 01:19:54.166
For what? l got your good looks,
your charm and your wit.

01:19:54.573 --> 01:19:56.336
l even got your memories.

01:19:56.775 --> 01:19:59.642
-You got my memories?
-Yeah.

01:19:59.711 --> 01:20:03.044
Never wondered how my people knew
to look for you in your hideout?

01:20:03.114 --> 01:20:06.641
Or the Paradise Motel, which,
by the way, is a disgusting establishment.

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:09.516
l'm surprised you didn't break
into a rash after staying there.

01:20:09.588 --> 01:20:12.250
Next time l'll remember
to find better accommodations.

01:20:12.324 --> 01:20:14.315
Mr. Mogan and Mr. Kelp have arrived, sir.

01:20:14.392 --> 01:20:16.519
Yes. By all means, send them in.

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.461
Mr. Mogan and Mr. Kelp.

01:20:18.697 --> 01:20:21.131
l've been waiting for those two gentlemen.

01:20:33.845 --> 01:20:35.210
-Boss?
-Quiet.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.338
Hey, everybody!

01:20:37.215 --> 01:20:38.614
Nash.

01:20:39.017 --> 01:20:41.884
-What's Nash doing here?
-No, l'm Rex Crater.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.853
No, you're Pluto Nash.

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:47.119
No, l beg to differ. l'm Rex Crater.

01:20:47.425 --> 01:20:49.290
This is Pluto Nash.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:55.992
Oh, my God.

01:20:56.067 --> 01:20:58.228
lsn't it something? But enough about him.

01:20:58.303 --> 01:21:02.535
Mr. Mogan, l want to personally thank you
for the outstanding job you've done.

01:21:03.675 --> 01:21:05.040
Thank you, sir.

01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:07.273
lt was a pleasure and an honor.

01:21:07.379 --> 01:21:12.214
You see, when you have the experience
me and my men have, it's quite easy--

01:21:15.987 --> 01:21:17.079
Oh, shit.

01:21:17.422 --> 01:21:19.413
lncompetent jackasses.

01:21:22.494 --> 01:21:23.961
Get them out of here.

01:21:30.101 --> 01:21:33.036
l'd love to let you hang around
so you can entertain me...

01:21:33.104 --> 01:21:35.572
...but we might have a conflict of interest.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.905
But there's something l want you to see
before l say bye-bye to you.

01:21:55.226 --> 01:21:56.215
Look at that.

01:21:56.861 --> 01:22:00.888
An excellent piece of real estate, but
you never took advantage of its potential.

01:22:01.066 --> 01:22:02.192
This--

01:22:04.903 --> 01:22:06.165
This is wrong.

01:22:06.237 --> 01:22:09.331
That should say Rex's,
because this is Rex's.

01:22:09.507 --> 01:22:12.999
Little America's most exclusive new casino!

01:22:13.311 --> 01:22:15.302
Tell me, what do you think?

01:22:31.029 --> 01:22:34.226
Little America is not a gambling town
and Pluto's isn't a casino.

01:22:34.299 --> 01:22:38.167
l think you're a clown and you should
take all this stupid casino shit out.

01:22:38.236 --> 01:22:40.431
lf you get your dumb-ass name
off the front...

01:22:40.505 --> 01:22:42.837
...maybe you'll be in business
for more than a week.

01:22:44.776 --> 01:22:47.336
-Sorry, it's not wood, is it?
-Yes, and it's hand-carved!

01:22:47.412 --> 01:22:48.640
Sorry! l'm sorry!

01:22:48.713 --> 01:22:50.374
Pick that shit up!

01:22:50.815 --> 01:22:51.782
Shit.

01:23:15.206 --> 01:23:16.935
Hold it, right there, robot.

01:23:26.317 --> 01:23:27.716
Which one's Pluto?

01:23:27.886 --> 01:23:29.046
Which one's Rex?

01:24:00.819 --> 01:24:02.013
Belcher!

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.815
-Shoot him, Belcher!
-Shoot him, Belcher!

01:24:10.328 --> 01:24:11.317
Damn it!

01:24:22.273 --> 01:24:24.241
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:27.039
Don't aim at me, he's Nash! Shoot him!

01:24:27.112 --> 01:24:29.842
He's not me, l'm me! He's him!
Shoot him!

01:24:29.914 --> 01:24:32.212
Boss, which one is you?

01:24:32.283 --> 01:24:33.045
Pluto?

01:24:33.118 --> 01:24:35.279
ldiots! He's the one in the rented tuxedo!

01:24:35.353 --> 01:24:36.183
Rex!

01:24:36.287 --> 01:24:37.276
Boss?

01:24:37.889 --> 01:24:40.449
-lt's him!
-This piece of shit belongs to him!

01:24:44.529 --> 01:24:45.553
Now shoot him!

01:25:00.145 --> 01:25:03.478
-What's the matter with you guys?
-lt was hairy there for a minute.

01:25:03.548 --> 01:25:04.742
Hairy for you?

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:07.417
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

01:25:07.752 --> 01:25:09.413
Hairy, my ass.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:11.318
You sing, don't you?

01:25:11.623 --> 01:25:13.989
You're a singer, right? l got a job for you.

01:25:15.026 --> 01:25:16.687
Just kill me and get it over with.

01:25:16.761 --> 01:25:20.788
You're going to work, but not singing.
Waiting tables, six nights a week.

01:25:20.865 --> 01:25:24.232
lf you're lucky and save your tips,
maybe you'll get back to Utah.

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:31.136
Pluto.

01:25:31.943 --> 01:25:34.537
l didn't scare you, did l? You all right?

01:25:37.182 --> 01:25:38.171
Boss!

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:41.208
l was hoping it was you.

01:25:43.755 --> 01:25:46.485
Never leave home
without an undershirt, right?

01:25:47.292 --> 01:25:49.783
lsn't that what you always say?

01:25:50.195 --> 01:25:53.323
Never leave home without an undershirt.
That's rule number one.

01:25:53.832 --> 01:25:54.890
l agree!

01:26:18.556 --> 01:26:20.285
Craps, you lose!

01:26:48.019 --> 01:26:50.852
For the grand reopening of Club Pluto...

01:26:51.055 --> 01:26:54.218
...please welcome Miss Dina Lake!

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:13.808
Pluto!

01:27:15.346 --> 01:27:17.211
Pluto, baby!

01:27:17.515 --> 01:27:19.676
Fantastic club! Great joint, baby.

01:27:19.751 --> 01:27:22.379
Thanks a lot. Let me say
that the Mrs. Francis'...

01:27:22.921 --> 01:27:25.856
-...are looking lovely tonight.
-Thank you, Pluto.

01:27:25.924 --> 01:27:27.858
-Have a good time.
-All right, baby.

01:27:28.159 --> 01:27:31.356
Did l tell you ladies how l got Pluto
started in the business?

01:27:31.429 --> 01:27:32.896
Tell us, Tony.

01:27:33.031 --> 01:27:36.797
What about a ham sandwich without
the cheese? How much would that be?

01:27:37.135 --> 01:27:38.102
Free!

01:27:38.169 --> 01:27:41.969
Felix Laranga's money is no good here.
Knock yourself out, whatever you want.

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.234
Thanks, Pluto!

01:27:43.308 --> 01:27:45.970
Pluto Nash, l love that man!

01:27:46.077 --> 01:27:51.208
Honey, l tell you what: Eight steaks,
a crate of lobsters, shrimp cocktail...

01:27:51.416 --> 01:27:54.510
...onion rings, fries, a doggy bag to go....

01:28:06.064 --> 01:28:08.032
How is it going with you and Babette?

01:28:08.099 --> 01:28:11.193
Me and Babette?
l don't think it's gonna happen.

01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:15.100
l found out that l'm 1 10 volts
and she's a 220.

01:28:15.173 --> 01:28:17.334
Go to the hardware store
and get an adapter.

01:28:18.409 --> 01:28:21.537
No. That just ruins it for me.

01:28:22.246 --> 01:28:24.237
l guess it wasn't meant to be, huh?

01:28:24.782 --> 01:28:27.250
Bruno, you see my new bodyguard
running around here?

01:28:29.287 --> 01:28:33.087
-New bodyguard?
-l bought a '78, fully loaded, out the door.

01:28:34.058 --> 01:28:36.049
Shall l begin disassembling myself?.

01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:39.355
lf you do that, how will you manage
my club in 500 pieces?

01:28:39.664 --> 01:28:43.760
Manage? But no robot
has ever been in management.

01:28:43.868 --> 01:28:45.096
You want the job or not?

01:28:45.303 --> 01:28:47.066
Oh, boss!

01:28:47.338 --> 01:28:49.101
Oh, thank you, boss!

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.804
You're the best boss on the whole Moon!

01:28:53.544 --> 01:28:56.069
You almost broke my ribs.

01:28:57.048 --> 01:29:00.245
Pull up a chair. Let's sit back
and celebrate and enjoy the party.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:05.022
Sorry, no can do. We've got a pile of bills,
the payroll is tomorrow.

01:29:05.156 --> 01:29:07.920
We need a new doorman
and we're low on shrimp.

01:29:07.992 --> 01:29:09.823
l'm swamped!
