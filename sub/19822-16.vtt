00:22.790 --> 00:25.257
He said, um...

00:25.326 --> 00:28.360

parents out of the picture... no.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.962

00:30.031 --> 00:33.332

00:33.401 --> 00:35.134
"We got the parents out of the picture.

"Now, we just need to
take care of the kids

00:38.873 --> 00:40.072
Take care of us?

What's he gonna do? Boil us and eat us?

00:43.044 --> 00:45.944
What's so crazy about that? I
think I'd be pretty tasty.

nobody's gonna eat us.

You know, they can't just,

00:57.658 --> 00:59.258
There must be laws or something, right?

00:59.326 --> 01:01.560
<i>That is a very good point, Max.</i>

01:01.629 --> 01:05.898
<i>They must think they can
find a deed to the house.</i>

01:05.966 --> 01:09.902

deed owns the house.</i>

01:09.970 --> 01:11.670

I mean, don't you keep
it in a safe place?

01:13.707 --> 01:15.874

never seen the deed.</i>

family for generations.</i>

01:20.514 --> 01:23.382

All that effort for time
a little piece of paper.

What language is that even in?

13:31.578 --> 13:33.111
Definitely Latin.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.880
But I have no idea what it means.

13:35.949 --> 13:38.349
Don't you have a Latin-English

Yeah, sorry, bro. You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine. What
are you doing here?

16:15.108 --> 16:16.708
Chasing after the dude with the hood.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.443
You didn't see him? He came right here!

16:18.511 --> 16:20.111
You mean Saganash?

16:20.180 --> 16:22.914
No, his henchman. They
call him Hoodie Head.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.248
That's Saganash.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.583
What? No, it's not.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.852
That's what Bruhl called him
when they met last night.

16:27.921 --> 16:29.320
Somebody's confused.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.055
Ah, I can't believe I lost him!

16:34.361 --> 16:36.928
Are you going to a
funeral or something?

16:36.997 --> 16:40.431
No, I... bought a new suit.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.433
You like it?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.303
Yeah. (chuckles)

16:45.372 --> 16:46.771
Why'd you let Anika do your hair?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.840
I didn't. Oh.

Blind man? (chuckles)

16:50.577 --> 16:53.077
Knock it off. I'm sorry.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.379
Blind man with a lawnmower?

I'm going to cook you
such a healthy meal.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.244
I got zucchini, I got beets,

17:27.313 --> 17:30.915
I got Brussel sprouts, I got asparagus.

17:30.984 --> 17:32.617
(girl) Yay.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.685
That's the spirit. We're going to eat

nothing but clean,
healthy, all-natural food.

Why is everybody so sad when I've got

17:56.009 --> 17:57.942
the world's biggest bag of chips?

17:58.011 --> 17:59.110
Where'd you get those?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.344
From the Bruhls.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.979
The Bruhls gave you a bag of chips?

18:02.048 --> 18:05.183
Well, no. I kinda took 'em.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.818
But they're trying to quit eating them,

18:06.886 --> 18:09.020
so I kind of did them a favor.

Oh, lawnmower.

Wait, what was wrong
with the old Daniel?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.906
So, did anything happen
with the relatives?

No. Yes.

We don't know who he followed.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.811
Doesn't matter who he followed.
He got away.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.514
So, which part of your
semi-successful mission

19:09.582 --> 19:11.582
was successful?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.651
I got a lot better at skateboarding.

Well... while you were chasing people

19:32.705 --> 19:35.273
and wasting time with old folks...

19:35.341 --> 19:38.543
and getting great haircuts...

19:38.611 --> 19:40.611
I found out what Bruhl's up to.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.247
What are you talking about, Anika?

19:45.485 --> 19:47.385
Whoa, those are
architectural blueprints.

Easy, I just knocked on
the door and walked in.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.795
I guess it pays to be friendly.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.431
Not always, especially not when
we're talking about Bruhl.

I swear it works. What are
you shushing at, bro?

someone's in the house.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.610

20:47.847 --> 20:49.447
I think something came
through the tunnels.

20:49.515 --> 20:52.016
Oh, I knew we should have
barricaded that door.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.751
The only one it could be is Saganash,

20:53.820 --> 20:55.720
he's the only one that
knows about the tunnels.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.555
Except his henchman. Hoodie Head!
