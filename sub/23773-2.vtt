FILM 2

01:08.600 --> 01:12.640
<i>If I lose the battle with the demons</i>
<i>before I die,</i>

01:12.720 --> 01:14.120
<i>help us all.</i>

01:16.560 --> 01:19.040
HOT COCOA - SMOOTHIES

01:41.280 --> 01:43.840
-Sasha, what, are you following me?
-No.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.640
-I’m just here a lot.
-And I’m not.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.600
Listen, I wanted to tell you then--

01:51.680 --> 01:53.560
Sasha, I’m begging you-- don’t. All right?

01:53.640 --> 01:56.480
-You don’t even know yet!
-I can see it in your eyes.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.360
You love me. Did I guess it?

01:58.440 --> 02:02.200
So, if it’s as I suspect,
you’d really like to fuck me.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.680
Auntie, you know a little bit about life.
What, am I wrong?

02:12.640 --> 02:15.120
-That isn’t what I wanted to say.
-What is it?

02:16.440 --> 02:18.040
Because I graduated with honors,

02:18.120 --> 02:20.680
they invited me to work as an assistant
in the prosecutor’s office.

02:20.760 --> 02:24.120
I turned it down.
I’m going for investigator.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.120
-Sash…
-What?

02:27.920 --> 02:29.840
Is trampling through the mud
your kind of a hunt?

02:29.920 --> 02:32.240
That’s not you. You’re too…

02:33.040 --> 02:34.480
What? Nice, right?

02:41.480 --> 02:42.880
Esenya Andreyevna?

02:43.560 --> 02:46.160
Meglin sent me. Are you ready to go?

02:46.240 --> 02:47.640
And how do you--

02:48.400 --> 02:49.720
I’m going.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.399
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

04:20.000 --> 04:21.399
<i>I love you.</i>

04:23.000 --> 04:24.760
He talked like that, you know…

04:27.040 --> 04:28.720
Not like deaf people talk.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.640
And then it turned out
he actually was deaf.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.840
And what did he say?

04:36.400 --> 04:37.600
Sit down.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.560
<i>He asked me which I liked more--</i>
<i>coffee or tea.</i>

04:42.760 --> 04:44.640
I said, “It depends on what kind.”

04:46.240 --> 04:49.120
He said, “The tea is black.
The coffee is black too.”

04:51.320 --> 04:52.720
Go ahead, study.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.480
<i>He offered me a cheese sandwich.</i>

04:58.080 --> 05:00.040
I asked, “Is the cheese black too?”

05:01.240 --> 05:02.640
He said, “No, it’s yellow.”

05:05.200 --> 05:07.600
CRIMINAL CASE - 1970
CRIMINAL CASE - 1957

05:36.080 --> 05:39.480
Are you going to tell me
if we’ll see him today, or ever?

05:39.560 --> 05:40.960
I’m getting bored.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.360
-Is your hearing aid broken?
-Yes!

06:29.200 --> 06:30.600
You don’t have to drive me.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.760
I’m going for a walk.

06:34.600 --> 06:38.560
I’m sick of this room
and your cheese sandwiches.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.360
And I’m also sick of Meglin--

06:46.760 --> 06:47.840
Let’s go.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.440
Stop, stop.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.400
I need to use the bathroom.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.960
Wait in the car.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.160
I don’t lock it. Are you drunk?

09:36.200 --> 09:37.400
What?

09:38.600 --> 09:40.000
Nothing. Everything is fine.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.720
Can I ask you something?

09:52.960 --> 09:57.360
How did you figure out
who the guy was that killed my friend?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.160
The glasses. What do you mean “the glasses?”

10:07.640 --> 10:09.760
His glasses are expensive.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.080
But his face isn’t.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.040
So, deduction?

10:20.200 --> 10:22.960
<i>Everyone around him</i>
<i>was screaming in horror.</i>

10:24.120 --> 10:26.960
<i>And he was watching quietly.</i>
<i>He couldn’t look away.</i>

10:28.480 --> 10:31.280
<i>He wasn’t horrified. He liked it.</i>

10:33.880 --> 10:35.320
And what’s your analysis?

10:38.320 --> 10:40.080
It’s all in the eyes.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.440
His wife left him.

10:47.520 --> 10:51.120
He loved her as he should have,
but she left. Why?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.520
Because she’s beautiful.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.240
And beauty is costly.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.240
She came in and said, “Sorry darling.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.720
I’ve fallen in love with someone else,
my dear.”

11:00.800 --> 11:03.080
In tears, he says,
“How could you fall in love? The bastard!”

11:03.160 --> 11:06.040
“Volod, listen.
Let’s go our separate ways peacefully.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.880
That’s it. Good-bye. I’m leaving.”

11:07.960 --> 11:09.640
He was stressed and couldn’t sleep.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.040
That night, he came up with the idea.
In the morning, he drew the designs.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.600
He made earrings.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.080
There was poison in the crystals.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.040
He put the earrings on her,
and, within a day, she died.

11:19.120 --> 11:21.680
He showed up and gave her the gift--
a reminder.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.040
And that’s it. No more wife.
But he still couldn’t sleep.

11:25.680 --> 11:29.160
Because his head was buzzing. How can
you sleep when your head is buzzing?

11:29.240 --> 11:30.600
Who are you talking to?

11:30.760 --> 11:34.640
Then this suave guy shows up and says,
“My, what a master you are.”

11:34.720 --> 11:36.440
Frightened, he says, “How do you know?”

11:36.520 --> 11:40.240
“I know, I know.
I have a nose for talent like yours.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.520
<i>Can you make a necklace?</i>
<i>But that’s not enough.</i>

11:42.600 --> 11:44.920
<i>You have to give it to her</i>
<i>in a way that she’ll accept it.</i>

11:45.000 --> 11:48.720
<i>And not the first one you meet,</i>
<i>the one that deserves it like your ex.</i>

11:48.800 --> 11:50.280
<i>A female who can be bought.”</i>

11:50.360 --> 11:52.400
<i>“And how will I know</i>
<i>which one deserves it?”</i>

11:52.480 --> 11:54.480
<i>“I’ll tell you.</i>

11:54.560 --> 11:57.160
<i>And I’ll write out the words</i>
<i>that will convince her to accept.</i>

11:57.240 --> 12:00.600
<i>I’ll write them, and you’ll memorize them,</i>
<i>repeating them word for word.</i>

12:00.680 --> 12:05.640
<i>Because you’re like a child--</i>
<i>not fully developed, right?”</i>

12:05.720 --> 12:09.640
God knows what you’ll think of me,
but, oh, well.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.600
“You were born in Kaluga.
Your dad is a drunkard.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.520
But no worries. You’ll rehearse. You’ll
grow up a bit at the same time, right?

12:15.600 --> 12:19.200
The fact that you have tape and screws
holding your glasses together--

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
<i>no big deal.</i>

12:20.360 --> 12:23.680
<i>I’ll buy you new ones. And a new suit too.</i>

12:23.760 --> 12:27.040
<i>Flawless. I’ve thought everything out.</i>
<i>Excellent. Excellent.”</i>

12:27.920 --> 12:30.440
<i>How can anyone throw away</i>
<i>something so beautiful?</i>

12:32.880 --> 12:34.280
Please.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.360
So it turns out there were two of them?

12:50.240 --> 12:53.040
The one they caught only made the device.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.800
There was a second one
who told him when to present it

12:56.880 --> 12:59.280
and under what circumstances.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.840
An accomplice.

13:01.760 --> 13:05.320
A finger puppet and a finger--
these are accomplices?

13:05.840 --> 13:07.240
No.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.640
You didn’t catch him?

13:10.240 --> 13:12.320
And how could we?

13:12.400 --> 13:15.840
He did everything right--
with someone else’s hands, not his own.

13:17.640 --> 13:20.080
“You won’t catch me.”

13:22.120 --> 13:24.400
Good job. Good job.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.040
Now about the Lipetsk murderer.

13:27.120 --> 13:31.480
Over two years, he killed nine girls
from the ages of 14 to 20.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.560
He killed them all with a cord.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.040
He acted boldly,
sometimes in front of witnesses.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.200
TRAIN STATION

13:40.280 --> 13:42.840
LIPETSK

14:10.760 --> 14:12.920
I love train stations. Don’t you?

14:14.040 --> 14:15.240
Not me.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.160
You need to.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.440
ATTENTION! WANTED

14:23.840 --> 14:27.360
Rodion Viktorovich? Meglin? Egorov.

14:28.120 --> 14:32.000
Egorov? You’re using your walkie-talkie
as a light? What are you, crazy?

14:32.360 --> 14:34.200
-Well, what?
-Meet my assistant, Nastya.

14:34.280 --> 14:36.360
-What do you have?
-We have everything set up.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.840
-What’s set up?
-Everything is set up-- the trap.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.120
The what?

14:41.680 --> 14:44.200
-The trap.
-And you set it up, right?

14:44.280 --> 14:45.480
-Yes.
-Good job.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.760
Look around, Nastya. What do you think?

14:54.880 --> 14:58.120
Honestly, it’s not really a trap.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.680
Egorov, maybe can you put up flyers
around the station

15:02.760 --> 15:04.240
so he can turn himself in.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.800
-Maybe that’s easier.
-It isn’t?

15:06.880 --> 15:08.920
-What’s wrong?
-These two are in a taxi.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.280
-So what?
-Egorov.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.840
Two guys are in a car. So what?

15:17.240 --> 15:19.320
It’s for one person,
and there are two here.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.000
-What the hell!
-Get out of here.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.840
One of you get out.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.920
-So this is what you’re doing here?
-He’s sitting. -Why isn’t he smoking?
-It’s a public place-- I get it.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.760
Here you go, smoke.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.640
Or remove him?

15:47.440 --> 15:48.880
-You came up with this?
-I did.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.040
-By yourself?
-By myself.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.520
Great work.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.320
<i>Train 8 arrives at 2:16.</i>

15:54.400 --> 15:57.480
<i>Train 8 arrives at 2:16.</i>

15:57.560 --> 15:59.280
And why doesn’t he stink?

15:59.360 --> 16:02.000
-What?
-He should reek. Of piss!

16:02.080 --> 16:05.000
Yes-- Well, should he piss himself
or something? Pardon me.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.640
What do you think, Egorov?

16:09.200 --> 16:10.720
Lekh, Remove Genka.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.080
Well, we need to get him ready.
I’ll explain later.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.160
Understood. We’re going.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.800
What? Wait. What?
The train will be here in three minutes.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.200
THE SUNRISE

16:42.240 --> 16:43.800
What a gentleman.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.720
-My God.
-Go.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.520
All right then, guys,
this is the situation.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.119
Major Meglin couldn’t make it. He’s busy.

17:13.800 --> 17:18.200
Our country is huge,
and there are many important cases.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.079
So he sent his comrades.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.040
Here we have…

17:25.119 --> 17:26.359
Ovechkin.

17:27.359 --> 17:30.200
Gennady Nikolaevich, forensic expert.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.040
And… Elena Petrovna Matyukhina--
especially important.

17:37.880 --> 17:43.240
She works hand in hand with Meglin,
so you understand…

17:43.960 --> 17:48.960
In general, we need to use
all our strength and… catch this psycho.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.840
Or he’ll continue with his black deeds,
and the press will smear us with shit.

17:55.680 --> 17:56.720
Quiet.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.800
Pardon me. Please.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.640
We know who the killer is.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.960
It’s… Kalugin Vyecheslav.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.640
Fifty-seven years old, insane.
We’ll give you the summary.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.000
You’re free to go. What was that?

18:42.840 --> 18:44.080
What was that?

18:56.880 --> 18:58.480
Do you like me?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.720
-In general.
-In your dreams.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.000
That was, at minimum,
completely unprofessional of you.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.200
Yeah?

19:09.240 --> 19:10.840
I just thought…

19:13.040 --> 19:14.560
if your…

19:15.600 --> 19:17.560
nipples got hard… he’d like you even more.

19:20.640 --> 19:21.840
Who is “he”?

19:33.480 --> 19:35.600
Why did you decide he’s a police officer?

19:36.080 --> 19:37.480
What do you think?

19:37.920 --> 19:41.200
He’s often on the road, and it explains
why he can easily approach the victim

19:41.280 --> 19:43.040
and establish trust at a distance.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.440
-Right?
-No. He loves power.

19:46.040 --> 19:50.200
At some point, he was badly hurt,
but now he can kill whoever he wants.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.160
Even witnesses don’t bother him.
No, he’s inside the system.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.720
He’s got a good thing going.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.200
He always attacks inside the park.
But it’s huge. What are we looking for?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.920
We’re looking for someplace
where he likes to kill.

20:02.440 --> 20:06.200
Someplace where something painful was done
to him, and now he’s the one doing it.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.920
What do you see?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.160
People, trees.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.240
And you?

20:25.680 --> 20:28.480
-He’s still young. He runs good.
-An athlete?

20:32.600 --> 20:35.040
Right here! He stopped and looked around.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.200
No one around, yeah? Grab her!

20:37.280 --> 20:39.320
Come here, bitch! Come on!

20:39.400 --> 20:40.840
Come on, come here!

20:40.920 --> 20:43.080
No one will see you, right? Or hear you. But they can. People are walking by.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.960
Come here, bitch!

20:48.040 --> 20:50.560
Come here. Here! Don’t turn away.

20:50.640 --> 20:53.440
You have to humiliate me here?

20:53.520 --> 20:56.880
Quiet, bitch! All right. Now I’ll--

21:45.920 --> 21:48.600
Samsonova Utkina.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.240
Pershina Krestsova.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.720
Who are they?

21:56.240 --> 21:57.840
The ones who hurt him.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.480
Girls.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.600
Little girls.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.640
He wasn’t running.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.520
He was running away.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
What?

22:18.120 --> 22:19.320
Nothing.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.040
INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE
MOSCOW

22:29.280 --> 22:31.200
I told them a hundred times.
They don’t understand.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.720
Do everything according to the plan
and don’t listen to anyone.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.400
Sasha.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.960
-Hello, Andrei Sergeyevich.
-Hello.

22:39.760 --> 22:42.480
Something… There’s something I wanted…

22:43.920 --> 22:45.120
Let’s walk.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.040
A lot is changing
in Esenya’s life right now.

22:49.840 --> 22:54.880
We-- Our task is to support her somehow
during this difficult time.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.200
Don’t you agree?

22:56.280 --> 23:00.040
Well-- I’d love to, except she doesn’t
want anything to do with me.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.640
Be more persistent. Come see us anyways.
I’m inviting you.

23:04.840 --> 23:06.240
Thanks. I’d love to.

23:06.320 --> 23:09.840
If you ever want to discuss something,
I’ll always listen.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.000
I need to be in the loop
about what’s going on with her.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.000
See you.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.520
Well, if you must, then of course look.

23:44.600 --> 23:50.560
I just don’t understand what our school
has to do with this serial killer.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.800
Tsipunin. Zinaida Mikhailovna!

23:52.880 --> 23:56.400
-Look at this.
-Simakin. What is this? Again?

23:56.480 --> 23:58.080
Never again. Go.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.240
The class record books, if I may.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.320
As you wish.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.520
ARCHIVES

24:34.120 --> 24:35.520

24:36.120 --> 24:37.400

UTKINA

24:39.640 --> 24:41.040
OLGA UTKINA

24:44.440 --> 24:45.640
They’re here.

24:51.160 --> 24:51.960
ARTAMONOV

24:52.040 --> 24:54.560
They graduated around ’98. He’s about 30.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.520
My list has the same names
that are scratched in the wall.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.200
We’ll go over every name and check them.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.760
We’ll go over every one.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.520
Are we going to do anything else today?

25:11.440 --> 25:12.640
Understood.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.360
He really doesn’t feel sorry for anyone?

25:18.440 --> 25:20.680
He only feels sorry for himself.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.000
Then why are there such long breaks
between murders?

25:24.080 --> 25:27.560
I thought it was something
like remorse or depression,

25:27.640 --> 25:29.240
like after sex.

25:29.920 --> 25:34.240
You’re depressed after sex?
That’s something to feel sorry about.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.920
No remorse whatsoever. Absolutely none.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.760
He’s just fine and wants to do it again.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.880
Then he’s not a man but a monster.

25:44.080 --> 25:48.080
When he’s not having an episode, he’s
a normal, nice guy-- like everyone else.

25:48.600 --> 25:52.040
A family man maybe. He wears a tie.

25:52.720 --> 25:54.640
All of us are part monster, part human.

25:54.720 --> 25:58.680
Why can’t he stop then
if he’s such a good person otherwise?

25:58.760 --> 26:00.640
He doesn’t want to stop.
Do you understand?

26:00.720 --> 26:03.000
These people should be killed
not prosecuted. -Yes.
-Do you sit here all the time?

26:08.920 --> 26:09.920
Take it.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.280
-From 9:00 to 9:00.
-Got it.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.400
Sit down. I’ll draw you.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.840
I don’t have time.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.440
It’ll only take a minute.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.000
Or I’ll draw your daughter.

26:24.200 --> 26:28.160
No, my daughter is going to get cognac.
Go on.

26:28.760 --> 26:29.960
Over there. Go on.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.800
A minute you said?

26:46.400 --> 26:49.960
Marilyn Monroe! Let me kiss your knee.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.760
-One second.
-What’s with you, man?

27:01.680 --> 27:05.600
Guys, you don’t understand.
I’m not touching anyone.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.360
I’m just walking here.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.400
What do you want?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.240
You guys don’t understand!

27:22.960 --> 27:24.360
Come on, throw him in!

27:26.000 --> 27:27.200
There you go!

27:29.880 --> 27:31.520
What are you-- idiots!

27:32.240 --> 27:33.480
Are you alive? Are you alive?

27:39.160 --> 27:40.800
-I’m alive.
-Have you lost your mind?

27:49.480 --> 27:50.880
I drank too much.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.800
THE SUNRISE

30:21.800 --> 30:23.800
ATTENTION! WANTED

30:39.840 --> 30:42.360
-Go on! Try me!
-What are you-- an idiot?

30:42.440 --> 30:44.520
You’ve completely lost your mind
over this psycho!

31:38.680 --> 31:40.080
What are you drawing?

31:49.360 --> 31:50.960
JACKASS

31:52.880 --> 31:56.760
There’s one doctor I know
who specifically asks his patients

31:57.480 --> 31:59.800
to draw everything that comes to mind.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.520
He thinks
you can understand them that way.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.920
DON’T BE ANGRY

32:04.520 --> 32:06.720
You look wonderful. Here’s your change.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.560
Thanks. It’s all because of the tie.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.880
As soon as I put it on,
the beatings start.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.760
-So take it off.
-I cant.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.720
I look wonderful in it.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.640
Yes. Yes, we’re going.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.200
They found another body.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.920
She was found this morning.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.600
She was killed today

32:42.240 --> 32:46.240
between five and seven o’clock
in the morning.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.160
MEDICAL EXAMINER’S OFFICE
MORGUE No. 2

33:43.200 --> 33:45.000
-Do you see how they’re staring?
-Let them stare.

33:45.080 --> 33:48.360
They don’t know how to bury the dead,
and they won’t save the living.

33:48.440 --> 33:52.080
-I heard you enjoyed yourselves yesterday.
-From who?

33:52.160 --> 33:55.080
Seryoga saw you yesterday. At the park.

33:55.680 --> 33:56.840
We were working too.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.360
Your serial killer…

33:59.360 --> 34:00.920
is on this list of 30 names.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.720
They went to school together.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.000
-How’d you find that out?
-How do you think?

34:06.080 --> 34:07.840
It’s a breakthrough, Major. She’s asking.

34:08.719 --> 34:09.719
Grish Belykh.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.960
Run a background search
on these classmates.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.239
Will do. Wait for me here.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.920
-What about me?
-I’ll be right back.

35:13.120 --> 35:16.680
Am I bothering you? Sorry.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.360
Sergei Mokrushin.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.920
Hello. What are you doing here.

35:25.720 --> 35:26.920
Patrolling.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.480
-Well, I saw you and decided--
-You decided what?

35:31.320 --> 35:32.520
To approach you.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.400
-But if I’m bothering you--
-You aren’t bothering me.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.040
How--

35:57.040 --> 35:58.640
How do you like the city?

35:59.920 --> 36:01.320
It’s nice.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.840
It’s a pity the reason for the trip is so…

36:07.560 --> 36:09.440
It’s not a big deal.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.400
It’ll all be over soon.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.520
Why do you think that?

36:15.360 --> 36:18.880
Well… you’re here.

36:22.960 --> 36:26.120
Why are you looking at me like that?

36:27.680 --> 36:30.680
Sergei,
why did you decide to join the police?

36:32.560 --> 36:33.800
Well…

36:35.080 --> 36:38.120
I ran track.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.040
And then I needed an apartment.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.920
And they gave me one.

36:45.520 --> 36:48.920
-What else do you think you’ll do?
-I don’t know.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.440
I’ll get married.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.000
How about I read your palm?

37:08.640 --> 37:11.680
-How?
-I’ll tell you the name of your wife.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.440
So…

37:29.000 --> 37:31.280
How should I know he had an alibi.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.200
Asking wasn’t in the cards?

37:35.280 --> 37:37.520
Where were you?
You completely abandoned me. -Well, is it bearable?
-Yes.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.240
Come here.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.520
-Check this out.
-What is it?

37:47.600 --> 37:48.640
Not what, but who.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.640
It’s the guy who stayed calm
while I was harassing those girls.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.560
I asked the sketch artist to draw him
while they beat me.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.040
Don’t you recognize him?

37:56.800 --> 38:00.120
His face is familiar.
Too bad it was far away.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.840
I couldn’t get any closer.
He’d have been spooked.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.480
-Go comfort your boyfriend.
-Where are you going?

38:24.960 --> 38:26.560
I’m going this way.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.200
Hello. Hello.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.040
Can we come in?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.480
And who is “we?”

39:48.000 --> 39:49.400
Come in.

40:04.720 --> 40:05.920
What are we drinking to?

40:06.440 --> 40:07.920
To getting to know each other.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.480
Or to children?

40:42.760 --> 40:44.240
Where’s your son?

40:45.000 --> 40:47.680
-Who knows anymore?
-Well, you know.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.120
Yeah.

41:14.680 --> 41:18.240
First my wife got sick. She died.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.000
Then he got sick…

41:24.120 --> 41:25.520
from grief.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.880
He became very ill.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.520
In school, he was teased and bullied.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.840
Faster! Faster!

41:37.920 --> 41:40.200
Pick up the pace.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.640
Run, loser.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.960
-Run!
-Run faster, you wuss!

41:57.160 --> 41:58.080
Catch your breath!

42:03.000 --> 42:05.520
Idiot! Boo! You’re shit!

42:06.400 --> 42:08.880
Hey! What’s going on here?

42:34.360 --> 42:36.520
Boo! You’re shit!

42:36.600 --> 42:37.880
Boo! You’re shit!

43:15.600 --> 43:17.600
He grew up nonetheless.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.480
He became a strong person.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.640
One last question.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.080
-Do you know what he grew up to be?
-What would you have done?

43:29.840 --> 43:31.440
What I’m going to do.

45:05.760 --> 45:08.880
Actually,
your restless friend told me to tell you

45:08.960 --> 45:11.080
he’s waiting for you in the park.

47:41.280 --> 47:44.280
Hello, Elena Petrovna.
Are you out for a walk?

47:46.200 --> 47:47.600
It’s late.

47:47.880 --> 47:50.200
A serial killer is in the city
and you’re looking so nice.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.040
Are you on the job?

47:58.360 --> 48:01.640
Understood. You’re on the job.
What are you looking for?

48:03.360 --> 48:04.960
Or did you already find it?

49:21.560 --> 49:23.960
At school, he used his mother’s last name.

49:24.040 --> 49:27.120
And when she died,
he took his father’s name.

49:27.880 --> 49:30.440
So we didn’t find him on the list.

49:30.520 --> 49:33.640
Meet Grigory Belykh.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.760
The Lipetsk Strangler.

49:36.200 --> 49:39.000
The sick, bullied child

49:39.080 --> 49:42.200
who wanted little girls to love him,
right?

49:42.680 --> 49:44.880
But the little girls didn’t love you.

49:44.960 --> 49:47.800
They made fun of you, yeah? Beat you up?

49:48.280 --> 49:52.000
They didn’t give you any, did they?
They’re wretches, not little girls, right?

49:52.080 --> 49:55.720
Well, Grisha grew up,
and he joined the police.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.960
He thought the girls would give it up
to a guy with a gun. Wrong again. Another failure, yeah?

50:02.280 --> 50:03.680
They didn’t give you any.

50:09.400 --> 50:11.280
You know better than I do.
What do you say?

50:12.640 --> 50:15.360
When did you first realize
what you needed?

50:15.440 --> 50:17.040
Did you detain someone?

50:17.840 --> 50:19.200
A prostitute?

50:21.520 --> 50:23.720
You started to strangle her
and immediately came, right?

50:25.840 --> 50:29.280
Yes, your childhood was hard, Grisha.
But why all this?

50:30.720 --> 50:33.320
Ten girls. Why?

50:33.920 --> 50:35.800
You can’t live with this.

50:36.520 --> 50:38.560
And now you won’t be able to.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.960
You would’ve been the 11th.

51:00.160 --> 51:03.440
No, Grish.
You didn’t score on the soccer team.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.880
How about we stop at 10?

51:10.440 --> 51:12.240
Go and choke.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.360
<i>You’re sure</i>
<i>that the strangler attacked Meglin</i>

51:52.920 --> 51:55.040
<i>and he defended himself.</i>

51:55.640 --> 51:58.200
<i>The wounds suggest otherwise.</i>

52:00.240 --> 52:02.240
I’m telling you what I saw.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.000
We know what Meglin did.

52:06.880 --> 52:09.320
I’d like to know
what you’re feeling right now.

52:10.640 --> 52:11.840
Horror.

52:22.040 --> 52:24.080
TOWN OF VASILKOVO

52:50.160 --> 52:50.880
What?
