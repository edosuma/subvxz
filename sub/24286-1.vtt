00:13.931 --> 00:15.433
You want it?
Try and get it.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.017
Give it to me.
Come on, Dash.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.602
Fakes right,
cuts left.

00:18.602 --> 00:20.604
No one's gonna catch him!

00:20.604 --> 00:22.940
I don't need to catch you,
you Neanderthal nitwit.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.275
I know where you sleep!

00:24.275 --> 00:26.402
Ugh. Ah!

00:28.529 --> 00:30.114
Hey! Liam and Dash,

00:30.114 --> 00:31.991
could you please
stop racing through...

00:33.576 --> 00:37.288
Tiffany, would you please
turn down the music?

00:39.457 --> 00:41.959
It's called rock and roll,
people!

00:41.959 --> 00:44.503
â™ª

00:47.923 --> 00:50.634
No headphones at the table.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.762
What are you listening to?

00:52.762 --> 00:54.263
Whale mating sounds.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.185
It relaxes me.

00:59.185 --> 01:00.853
Oh, hey, guess what.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.813
I'm sending in
a patent application today.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.482
Really

01:04.482 --> 01:06.901
The Pickle Popper.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.069
- That was one of Dad's best.
- Mm-hm.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.863
If it sells like
the ButterMe Toaster,

01:10.863 --> 01:12.072
we'll be rich.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.366
Oh, honey, I wish.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.077
Uh, we sold just about enough
of these suckers

01:17.077 --> 01:19.705
to buy ourselves
a 12-year-old Astro van.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.624
The van that can.

01:21.624 --> 01:22.958
If you mean
"only start half the time

01:22.958 --> 01:24.376
and randomly honk the horn,"

01:24.376 --> 01:26.796
then yes, it definitely can.

01:29.215 --> 01:31.425
Yelp says
you're a five-star foot rubber.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.593
Let's see what you got.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.345
Nnh...

01:34.345 --> 01:36.680
Those are the feet of
a 29-year-old.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.098
Tom Jones told me that.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.099
Ah!

01:39.099 --> 01:40.768
Hey, uh, Wyatt,

01:40.768 --> 01:42.561
can you actually
help me out upstairs, huh?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.396
See what Dash broke this time.

01:44.396 --> 01:46.106
Uh. Ow.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.527
What is going on in here?

01:49.527 --> 01:51.195
- It's his fault. It's so his fault.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.613
- He just attacked me.
- He's the spaz, not me.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.490
He screwed up my game
with Ludvik.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.492
And who is Ludvik?

01:56.492 --> 01:58.035
This kid from Scrabble he's
playing online checkers with.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.578
We were playing Scrabble,
and he's from

01:59.578 --> 02:00.955
the Czech Republic,
you troglodyte.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.331
I don't know what that means,

02:02.331 --> 02:03.749
but it sounds like an insult!

02:03.749 --> 02:05.459
Hey, hey, come on.
Guys!

02:05.459 --> 02:07.127
Guys?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.294
Stop it.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.256
Ugh.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.174
- Ow.
- Hey!

02:12.174 --> 02:14.718
Family meeting,
downstairs in five.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.179
Good job.

02:18.222 --> 02:21.600
Okay, look, I know we've been
through a lot lately,

02:21.600 --> 02:24.812
and there are surely
more tough times ahead,

02:24.812 --> 02:26.856
but we're just...

02:26.856 --> 02:28.816
we're not being nice
to each other.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.401
We're not acting like a family,

02:30.401 --> 02:33.696
and I'm not mad, I'm just...

02:33.696 --> 02:35.990
I'm just disappointed.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.492
Go easy.
Look how sad they are.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.956
Give 'em up. Now.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.214
Look, you boys
go back to school on Monday,

02:52.214 --> 02:54.884
and next weekend is...

02:54.884 --> 02:56.719
well, it would've been
your father's birthday,

02:56.719 --> 03:01.056
so I... I think we should
do something.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.850
You know, your dad always made
such a big deal

03:02.850 --> 03:04.310
out of your birthdays.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.520
It seems right
that we honor his.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.730
Any ideas?

03:15.321 --> 03:20.409
Well, what if
we had some friends over, and...

03:20.409 --> 03:22.828
we showed them
a few of Dad's inventions?

03:22.828 --> 03:25.497
Well, that's an interesting
idea.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.917
I mean, your dad
loved his inventions,

03:27.917 --> 03:29.627
but they do need
a little spiffing up,

03:29.627 --> 03:33.380
so how about we all help
Wyatt with his plan, okay?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.798
What do you guys think?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.258
I don't know. I guess.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.885
Okay, could I get
a little enthusiasm?

03:37.885 --> 03:40.262
- I guess.
- I don't know!

03:40.262 --> 03:41.472
Can we go now?

03:41.472 --> 03:43.599
Yes, adjourned.

04:06.664 --> 04:07.623
Boo.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.084
I...is he going to
be okay?

04:52.084 --> 04:53.419
Little dude went down
faster

04:53.419 --> 04:54.962
than a fat guy
on a water slide.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.547
No, don't worry
about Wyatt.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.090
He's a fainter.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.508
Yeah, that happens
a lot with goats.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.592
Well, at least
the goats I knew.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.177
What?

05:02.177 --> 05:03.721
Is there something on my face?

05:03.721 --> 05:06.432
Yes.
Actually, it's the whole face.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.934
It's pretty weird.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.060
Hey.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.272
- - Hey, honey.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.690
Honey, stay with us, okay?

05:14.690 --> 05:16.400
Wyatt, Wyatt,
you remember your uncle Terry?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.068
Your father's twin.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.279
I am so sorry
I scared you, little buddy.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.406
My bad.
You know, I forgot it's been

05:22.406 --> 05:23.866
five years since I've been here.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.325
I'm still not sure why.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.327
Didn't you burn down
our tree house?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.537
That's all conjecture
and hearsay.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.164
I can't comment any further.

05:30.164 --> 05:33.042
Isn't it great to see
your dad's little brother again?

05:33.042 --> 05:34.334
Little brother?
But you and Dad

05:34.334 --> 05:36.211
are identical twins.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.505
Identical, yes, but Terry's
a good nine minutes younger.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.340
He's always been
my little baby ever since.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.926
Mom, this little baby's
done a lot of growing up.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.803
Hey, can you make me
the little smiley-face pancakes

05:44.803 --> 05:46.722
- I love

05:46.722 --> 05:48.682
Coming right up. I get to pour the syrup!

05:48.682 --> 05:49.892
Don't pour the syrup! I know, I know.

05:49.892 --> 05:52.352
Pancakes!

05:52.352 --> 05:55.439
Oh, good.
More children in the house.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.395
Quarterback pulls out.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.564
Deep pass to the right side.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.780
Dash, you, um...

06:44.780 --> 06:46.657
you think about Dad a lot?

06:51.662 --> 06:54.123
Hands it off...

06:54.123 --> 06:56.291
Mom said I have to move in
with you invertebrates.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.919
Uncle Terry's getting
the sofa bed in the living room.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.295
No way!

07:00.295 --> 07:02.214
You think I'm happy
about this?

07:02.214 --> 07:04.133
Last year, I had to give up
my room to crazy Grandma.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.051
Now I have to give up
the living room to Bizarro Dad.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.970
It's just cruel.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.179
Hey!

07:09.179 --> 07:11.265
Ah!
God!

07:11.265 --> 07:13.100
"Let the strongest live

07:13.100 --> 07:15.144
and the weakest die."
Charles Darwin.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.729
"You're a butt-face."
Dash McKenna.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.524
Are you guys gonna help me
with Dad's inventions?

07:20.524 --> 07:22.484
Chill.
We have all week.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.820
Yeah, and Uncle Terry said
he'll take care of the party.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.864
How long is Uncle Terry
gonna stay here?

07:26.864 --> 07:29.908
Until he gets arrested again,
or burns something else down.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.493
So he did burn down
the tree house?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.120
Oh, no!
Quiet, I've got to focus.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.372
Ludvik just dropped
an 80-pointer on me.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.292
Okay, I think you guys
have had--

07:38.292 --> 07:40.043
Dig, dig!
Oh, no, you don't!

07:40.043 --> 07:41.670
I know you're using an
anagram app, you Czech cheater!

07:41.670 --> 07:44.047
Penalty

07:44.047 --> 07:45.340
God. Oh, no!

07:45.340 --> 07:47.676
Hello. Yo, Mom here.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.145
No! My game stopped!

07:58.145 --> 08:00.397
What happened?

08:00.397 --> 08:02.316
- Mom, the router stopped...
- Mom, the wi-fi's off!

08:02.316 --> 08:04.109
I can't play my game
with the TV off.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.987
The wi-fi's not working.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.072
I have something here
from your dad...

08:10.782 --> 08:15.120
and he told me I'd know when
to give it to you, and...

08:15.120 --> 08:16.872
he was right.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.798
"Under the ga-nome"?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.717
What's a ga-nome?

08:30.093 --> 08:32.136
What's a ga-nome?

08:34.932 --> 08:36.892
Tree house.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.312
Purple haze.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.236
Bermuda.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.076
â™ª

09:00.165 --> 09:01.708
What's so dangerous
about a book?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.210
For you?
Trying to read it.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.883
Hey, hold on,
hold on.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.346
I also have a letter
from your dad.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.102
Want me to read it?

09:20.102 --> 09:21.561
Yeah.

09:27.651 --> 09:31.029
"Hi, kiddos.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.824
Hey, I know this
may seem weird,

09:33.824 --> 09:37.244
but I had a lot of fun
making this book for you guys.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.330
I know it must feel like
I'm not there to be with you,

09:40.330 --> 09:45.127
sharing the things that I love
with the people I love most,

09:45.127 --> 09:47.337
but I am,

09:47.337 --> 09:49.965
on every page of this book.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.178
Maybe if this book
sparks your imagination,

09:55.178 --> 09:58.223
you'll put down the gadgets
for a few minutes.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.936
I want you boys
to be dangerously good

10:02.936 --> 10:04.730
and take some chances,

10:04.730 --> 10:08.191
get lost,
try new things,

10:08.191 --> 10:09.776
be fearless.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.654
'Just do it.'

10:12.654 --> 10:14.573
Wait, no, that's Nike,

10:14.573 --> 10:18.327
and they might sue.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.872
Mine is 'You can't succeed
unless you're willing to fail.'

10:21.872 --> 10:26.501
Life's an adventure,
so go out and live it.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.712
I love you forever. Dad."

10:36.803 --> 10:37.971
Oh, get off of me.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.348
Dude, move!

10:39.348 --> 10:40.891
Okay, fine. Dash!

10:40.891 --> 10:42.476
You're gonna
break it.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.269
Submarines.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.896
Hey, hey, hey.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.732
"The first submarine
was tested in the River..."

10:51.360 --> 10:52.986
Whatever.
- Oh, look, look.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.697
Whoa. "Making a paper hat."

10:55.697 --> 10:58.033
"Imagine you're wearing
your paper hat

10:58.033 --> 11:00.535
in your paper boat."

11:00.535 --> 11:02.579
Wait, wait, wait,
I was looking at that.

11:02.579 --> 11:03.955
Great Wall of China.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.457
Oh, where's that?

11:05.457 --> 11:07.376
- China.
- Oh.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.419
Go-carts.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.962
Coin tricks.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.964
Oh, astronomy.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.174
Frogs.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.926
Frogs don't have ears.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.386
- Yes, they do.
- Yes, they do. Come on, Dash.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.471
I think Dad's wrong
on this one.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.264
Whoa, I'm not done
reading the pictures!

11:21.264 --> 11:22.682
Whoa, what's this?

11:22.682 --> 11:24.351
Pyramids.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.685
Temple of Artemis.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.271
This is so cool.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.570
Oh...wow.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.197
That's gonna take some time.

11:37.197 --> 11:41.201
Mm. This is gonna be
a killer party,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.787
and I'm not just saying that
'cause it's my birthday, too,

11:43.787 --> 11:45.330
so don't even think about
getting me a present.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.706
I'm a size large.
Whatever.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.084
Um...

11:49.084 --> 11:52.379
Look, Terry, I'm really glad
that you've come back

11:52.379 --> 11:54.881
to process everything
that's happened, you know,

11:54.881 --> 11:57.050
but at this moment,

11:57.050 --> 11:59.094
and you being you...

11:59.094 --> 12:01.346
Oh, you mean
'cause, um...

12:01.346 --> 12:03.014
'cause I look just like him,
right?

12:03.014 --> 12:06.935
Well, yeah, there's that,
but, and no offense,

12:06.935 --> 12:10.188
I'm just worried that
you might not be

12:10.188 --> 12:12.774
the greatest role model
for the kids.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.734
Oh, yeah, no, no, no.
No offense taken.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.987
Uh, and...and...

12:16.987 --> 12:19.573
you have nothing to
worry about, Beth.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.658
I've changed my ways.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.827
I'm a very different man
than I used to be.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.873
Thank you for holding.
Can I help you?

12:27.873 --> 12:29.499
Yes, hello,
it's Father O'Herlihy here

12:29.499 --> 12:30.792
from the orphanage,
calling about

12:30.792 --> 12:32.961
the deluxe fog maker.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.379
Ah, it would just warm
the cockles

12:34.379 --> 12:35.922
of the little tykes' hearts

12:35.922 --> 12:37.632
if you could find it
in your soul...

12:37.632 --> 12:39.718
45%. Great, yes.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.429
Where are you, Wyatt?
My dogs are barking!

13:03.783 --> 13:05.202
"The command module
separates from

13:05.202 --> 13:06.536
the Saturn rocket."

13:06.536 --> 13:08.246
Cool.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.457
"It rotates and docks with
the lunar module,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.751
also known as the LEM."

13:18.673 --> 13:22.135
Adventurer...

13:51.581 --> 13:53.458
Adventurer,
this is Houston.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.834
Come in.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.258
Um...

14:01.258 --> 14:02.592
hello?

14:02.592 --> 14:04.928
Wyatt, there you are.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.097
Glad to hear communication's
back up and running.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.224
Dad, is...

14:09.224 --> 14:10.308
is that you?

14:10.308 --> 14:13.687
Yep, it's me.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.522
But, uh...

14:15.522 --> 14:17.857
Listen, there are a lot of dads
around here, so...

14:17.857 --> 14:19.484
we'd best keep it official.

14:19.484 --> 14:22.862
I'm Houston,
you're Adventurer.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.824
Adventurer,
do you copy?

14:25.824 --> 14:30.036
Yeah, yeah, I copy, Dad...
Houston.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.122
Adventurer,

14:32.122 --> 14:33.748
you're a go.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.126
Go

14:36.126 --> 14:39.045
To the moon.
Where else, champ?

14:45.635 --> 14:48.138
What?
No, no, I can't.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.264
I can't do that.

14:49.264 --> 14:52.892
Are you crazy? I'm ten!

14:52.892 --> 14:54.227
There you are,
you little sneak.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.438
Mom, I'm working here.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.148
- Grandma

14:58.148 --> 15:00.775
These feet aren't gonna
massage themselves.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.238
Come on, boys,
let's go.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.823
You don't want to be late
on your first day back.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.575
This party is gonna rock.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.201
I got some great stuff
set up.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.953
Now, you're not gonna
believe this,

15:11.953 --> 15:13.580
but I once worked
as a carnie.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.081
Oh, that's not remotely
hard to believe.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.833
So I got a lead
on a tilt-a-whirl.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.044
- Wow.
- Best of all.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.503
I booked a musical act.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.755
- Yeah?
- Little band.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.214
You might have heard of them.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.717
- KISS? Ah, sweet!

15:25.717 --> 15:27.552
I can finally collect!

15:27.552 --> 15:29.638
Gene's owed me 100 bucks
since the "Love Gun" tour.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.348
Or was it Paul?

15:35.310 --> 15:37.646
Liam, remember how
Dad used to steer with his knees

15:37.646 --> 15:41.650
so he could do
a drum solo on the dashboard?

15:41.650 --> 15:45.570
Yeah, I... I kind of.
Um...

15:45.570 --> 15:48.156
Oh, look, the price of gas
went up 9/10 of a cent.

15:48.156 --> 15:50.325
The Saudis are playing hardball.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.206
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.749
What'd you honk for?

15:57.749 --> 15:59.125
No, it does it
on its own.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.919
I know.
It just does it.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.090
Hey, Sam.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.508
You weren't here,
so I finished

16:06.508 --> 16:07.842
the five food group mobile
without you.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.764
All right, quiet, everyone.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.307
Quiet.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.768
Let's welcome Wyatt
back to class.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.770
Hi, Wyatt.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.313
Now, we need to let
Wyatt know

16:20.313 --> 16:22.607
that he has support
here in this classroom,

16:22.607 --> 16:23.775
okay?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.402
Because he's hurting.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.530
Deep down inside,
right here,

16:28.530 --> 16:32.742
and it's not the kind of hurt
you can put a Band-Aid on,

16:32.742 --> 16:34.119
so we need to be kind to him.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.248
Okay? Okay.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.291
Okay, take a seat.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.211
Okay, I hope everyone
had a nice weekend.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.713
Mine was not good.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.339
I won't bore you
with the details.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.883
Okay, so these
alternate interior angles,

16:48.883 --> 16:51.136
one and three,
are created by this transversal,

16:51.136 --> 16:53.430
and one and three form
alternate interior angles,

16:53.430 --> 16:55.432
which are always...
supplementary?

16:55.432 --> 16:57.267
No, congruent.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.270
One and two are...

17:00.270 --> 17:01.646
Two, one...

17:01.646 --> 17:03.231
zero.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.483
Adventurer,
disengage the LEM

17:05.483 --> 17:06.693
from Command Module.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.237
Dad! I mean, Houston!

17:09.237 --> 17:10.530
I can't do this.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.323
I have no idea what I'm doing.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.576
You gotta believe
in yourself, Commander.

17:14.576 --> 17:17.494
I do.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.000
What's happening

17:22.000 --> 17:23.792
Okay, here's what
you have to do.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.420
Yo, Wyatt!

17:27.255 --> 17:28.798
Whoa.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.342
Check it out.
Even my puke floats.

17:31.342 --> 17:32.927
Dash!
Liam?

17:32.927 --> 17:35.013
Get off me! In space,

17:35.013 --> 17:37.098
no one can smell your farts.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.601
Stop! Moon! Crash!

17:39.601 --> 17:41.603
Houston! Don't panic.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.938
Everything will be fine
if you just...

18:15.678 --> 18:17.806
Only one that stuck with it,
huh?

18:17.806 --> 18:19.557
Dash and Liam
really like it.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.643
They just have other stuff
they have to do.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.229
Mm-hm.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.147
Hey, how's it going?

18:26.147 --> 18:28.066
- With the inventions?
- Mm-hm.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.026
Really great.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.528
How are you with Uncle Terry...

18:31.528 --> 18:32.987
Taking over the party planning?

18:34.531 --> 18:36.574
I trust he'll do
the right thing.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.076
I mean, he's out there
right now,

18:38.076 --> 18:40.119
hanging lights for his stage.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.915
- - Ugh...

18:43.915 --> 18:45.166
He keeps on shouting.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.420
Oh, God.
I'll get the first aid kit.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.686
Ah!

19:04.686 --> 19:06.396
Agh.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.912
What's shaking, kiddo?

19:22.912 --> 19:26.666
Tiffany, can you help me
with one of Dad's inventions?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.002
I can't do it alone.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.462
Uh, gosh, sweetie,
no, I can't.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.673
I'm going out
in a little while.

19:39.470 --> 19:42.307
Why won't anyone
talk about Dad?

19:44.100 --> 19:47.687
Oh, honey.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.938
There's a good reason.

19:53.943 --> 19:57.030
If we talk about Patrick now,

19:57.030 --> 20:00.158
he'll think we're calling him
back.

20:00.158 --> 20:03.870
We need to let his spirit
make its journey.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.456
So, when can we talk about him?

20:06.456 --> 20:10.919
He needs three moon cycles
to reach the celestial terminus.

20:10.919 --> 20:13.254
Hm?

20:13.254 --> 20:15.048
Hey, do me a solid.
Hand me that hairbrush.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.678
Here, oh.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.348
Oops.

20:24.807 --> 20:25.975
Oh.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.686
Adventurer.

20:28.686 --> 20:29.938
Help! Dude!

20:29.938 --> 20:30.980
Wyatt!

20:30.980 --> 20:32.231
Something's wrong!

20:32.231 --> 20:33.316
Prepare for moon landing.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.317
Stop beeping!

20:35.318 --> 20:36.277
Uh-oh.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.073
Dad!
I mean, Houston!

20:40.073 --> 20:42.241
You were going to tell me
what to do.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.410
What is it?

20:44.410 --> 20:46.579
The first thing you need to do
is calm down, son.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.331
The key to being
a good leader

20:48.331 --> 20:50.458
is controlling your emotions.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.628
I can't be a leader.
I'm just a kid.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.005
Even though you're the smallest
and you don't think

20:56.005 --> 20:57.757
you're strong enough
or brave enough,

20:57.757 --> 20:59.467
you can do it.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.469
You can be a leader.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.929
I know you can.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.062
Dash, put that fire out.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.106
Liam, plot the
landing trajectory and speed.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.363
Dash, get on those thrusters.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.490
I need you to stop
the spinning.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.783
What?
- You can do it.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.702
I know you can.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.370
It's just like a video game.
Give short trigger bursts

21:27.370 --> 21:29.497
until the needle goes under
the red line.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.541
Okay, and if
I accidentally kill us,

21:31.541 --> 21:33.334
I'll just start the level
over again, right?

21:33.334 --> 21:35.294
It's not that much
like a video game.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.337
Got it.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.929
I have coordinates
and landing specs.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.305
We're stable.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.932
Excellent.
Good work, guys.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.934
We need to get into
the lunar module.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.144
Follow me.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.689
Lunar module
has good descent.

21:54.689 --> 21:57.316
1,000 feet till touchdown.

21:57.316 --> 21:58.943
We have touchdown.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.486
They did it!
All right!

22:00.486 --> 22:02.238
- Yes!
- Well done!

22:05.199 --> 22:09.120
One small step for Man,

22:09.120 --> 22:10.663
one giant...

22:10.663 --> 22:12.623
Hunk of green cheese for me!

22:17.253 --> 22:18.838
That's not cheese.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.590
Hey, it's not cheese.

22:38.316 --> 22:41.152
Boy, this is nothing
like Pink Floyd described it.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.886
Dad?

23:06.886 --> 23:09.222
Are you still here?

23:14.477 --> 23:15.686
Always.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.033
Hey, buddy.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.493
All right, little guy.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.245
- Okay.
- Hey.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.414
You okay, sweetie?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.125
Yeah.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.751
I wanna call
a family meeting.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.964
Hey.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.884
Everyone,
living room in two.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.517
Okay, so, honey,
is this about the party?

23:54.517 --> 23:57.019
Yes.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.313
And no.

23:59.313 --> 24:02.275
I wanted us to talk about Dad.

24:02.275 --> 24:06.362
I thought everyone
could say one thing about him.

24:06.362 --> 24:07.363
Anything.

24:13.828 --> 24:16.414
I remember how Dad
tipped everybody.

24:16.414 --> 24:17.999
Not just waiters
and delivery guys,

24:17.999 --> 24:21.043
but, like, bus drivers
and doctors.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.753
I remember one time,
he stuck a 20

24:22.753 --> 24:24.297
into the dentist's pocket, said,

24:24.297 --> 24:26.007
"Thanks for the extra floss,
boss."

24:29.969 --> 24:33.014
Patrick was...

24:33.014 --> 24:34.473
Oh, gosh. He... He was a...

24:34.473 --> 24:36.893
an artist with a foot rub.

24:36.893 --> 24:40.646
He was the Michelangelo
of massage.

24:42.023 --> 24:45.526
Tiffany, is that really
what you wanted to say?

24:47.570 --> 24:51.616
No, honey, it's not.

24:51.616 --> 24:54.702
I guess
I've just been...

24:54.702 --> 24:56.662
you know, running away
from all these feelings

24:56.662 --> 24:59.749
'cause...I miss him so much.

25:02.251 --> 25:05.338
And I remember...

25:05.338 --> 25:08.049
Patrick's smile. Oh!

25:09.884 --> 25:12.887
His beautiful smile

25:12.887 --> 25:15.514
made me feel...

25:15.514 --> 25:18.017
loved.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.481
I... I never would've
graduated high school

25:23.481 --> 25:25.733
without Patty.

25:25.733 --> 25:28.736
He took a math quiz
for me once.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.696
And a history test.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.365
Science exam.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.033
Took my SATs.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.660
He broke up with three girls
for me.

25:35.660 --> 25:39.121
Man, he was...
He was a great brother.

25:41.207 --> 25:45.336
I remember how
Dad never let me quit.

25:45.336 --> 25:47.838
Like with that diorama
of the Boston Tea Party.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.590
That turned out so well.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.425
It was terrible.

25:51.425 --> 25:54.053
I left it on the radiator,
and Paul Revere melted.

25:56.180 --> 25:59.141
But, like Dad always said,

25:59.141 --> 26:02.770
you can't succeed
unless you're willing to fail.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.814
I know what he means now.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.194
Okay, Mom?

26:10.194 --> 26:13.072
Oh, okay.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.782
Well, I remember that he

26:14.782 --> 26:17.368
made up a special dance
for each of us.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.120
That's right.
Mine was the Rusty Robot.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.579
Right?

26:24.166 --> 26:25.876
That's it! That's the one.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.503
That was the
Rusty Robot. I remember.

26:27.503 --> 26:28.462
Oh! Turn it off.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.299
And we had
the high-speed hustle.

26:31.299 --> 26:32.550
Right, right.

26:32.550 --> 26:33.968
That's the one,
right.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.847
Yeah!

26:37.847 --> 26:39.223
The high-speed hustle.
- Whoo.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.267
Whenever he saw that
one of us was sad,

26:41.267 --> 26:42.935
he would do that
silly octopus dance

26:42.935 --> 26:43.936
until we laughed.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.021
The octopus dance!

26:45.021 --> 26:46.272
The octopus dance...

26:46.272 --> 26:47.606
That's ridiculous,
right?

26:58.784 --> 27:00.536
Gather round, everyone!

27:00.536 --> 27:03.080
Simply light the wick

27:03.080 --> 27:07.001
and behold Rapunzel's
sparkling hair.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.714
The wick...

27:11.714 --> 27:13.382
the wick...

27:15.176 --> 27:17.845
So, the bread goes in here.

27:17.845 --> 27:20.389
The butter is in here.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.766
Hi, everyone.

27:21.766 --> 27:23.517
I wanted to show you all

27:23.517 --> 27:25.770
my dad's favorite invention.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.319
The Dynamo Carousel.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.197
He called this
a "smile-maker."

27:36.197 --> 27:39.617
I couldn't figure out
how to make this thing go,

27:39.617 --> 27:42.036
and then I realized that
Dad wanted us all

27:42.036 --> 27:44.246
to work together on this one.

27:44.246 --> 27:47.500
Mom, Dash, Liam,

27:47.500 --> 27:49.668
come up here, please.

27:49.668 --> 27:53.589
You too, Uncle Terry.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.841
Haven't been on
one of these in a week.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.593
Hi-ho, Silver!

28:01.097 --> 28:03.265
Oh...

28:10.231 --> 28:12.024
It's working!

28:12.024 --> 28:13.818
Ho ho ho!

28:35.840 --> 28:37.425
Is there a Terry here?

28:39.927 --> 28:43.222
Minikiss?
That's why they were half-off.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.723
Awesome!
They're just like KISS,

28:44.723 --> 28:45.724
only mini-er.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.976
And KISS-ier.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.359
Mm.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.111
Your dad would've loved this.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.823
He does.
