WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.046
SOMETHING SMELLS DELICIOUS.

00:03.046 --> 00:04.526
MAMA WENT ALL OUT.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.571
DINNER'S READY.
COME AND GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.315
PEI-LING: OOH.

00:11.315 --> 00:13.317
HEY, IS SEBASTIAN COMING?

00:13.317 --> 00:14.840
UH, SAID HE
WASN'T FEELING IT.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.364
LEAVING THE RESTAURANT
HIT HIM PRETTY HARD.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.322
HE JUST NEEDS TIME.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.541
SO, BABA...
YES?

00:19.541 --> 00:21.064
HOW'S THE CAMPAIGN
GOING?

00:21.064 --> 00:23.327
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
ON THE BALLOT.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.373
AS A WRITE-IN!

00:25.373 --> 00:26.591
JIN SHEN,
CITY SUPERVISOR.

00:26.591 --> 00:27.940
HAS A NICE RING.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.203
FIRST I HAVE TO WIN.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.901
OH. GOT IT.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.511
GOT A KICKOFF MEETING
WITH MY CAMPAIGN MANAGER
TOMORROW. WHERE'S DENNIS?

00:33.511 --> 00:35.861
HE'S MEETING
HIS PARENTS IN NAPA.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.515
THEY HAVEN'T SPOKEN
FOR MONTHS,

00:37.515 --> 00:39.517
BUT I PUSHED HIM
TO MEND FENCES...

00:39.517 --> 00:42.216
UH, BO, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

00:42.216 --> 00:43.782
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH YOU.

00:43.782 --> 00:46.785
SORRY. BOSS HAS ME
WORKING DOUBLES.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.182
MEI-LI:
NICKY, WHO'S AT THE DOOR?

00:52.182 --> 00:54.271
OH, IS THIS A BAD TIME?

00:54.271 --> 00:56.273
WE WERE JUST SITTING
DOWN TO DINNER.

00:56.273 --> 00:59.102
THERE'S
PLENTY OF FOOD.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.973
YOU SURE?

01:00.973 --> 01:04.542
MAMA, BABA,
UH, THIS IS BO.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.066
HI.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.546
OH, HEY, COME ON IN.
MEI-LI: BO.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.113
HEY.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.549
THIS IS MAMA AND BABA.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.769
AND YOU REMEMBER
RYAN AND ALTHEA.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.815
UM, AND THIS IS
MY OLD FRIEND PEI-LING.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.730
HELLO. NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.298
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

01:21.298 --> 01:22.995
MEI-LI: PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.

01:31.656 --> 01:36.574
YOU'RE HERE.
SO YOU DECIDED TO SKIP
THE SHEN FAMILY DINNER?

01:36.574 --> 01:39.099
I WASN'T INVITED.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.665
EVEN I GOT...

01:40.665 --> 01:42.667
AN INVITE.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.800
SO IT'S TRUE,
YOU AND NICKY.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.584
YEAH. I LEFT.
SHE MOVED ON. WE'RE GOOD.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.760
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

01:48.760 --> 01:50.240
I WAS RUNNING DRY
ON HARVESTER LEADS.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.937
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
MIGHT'VE HAD SOME LUCK.

01:51.937 --> 01:53.939
YOU WANT TO
COLLABORATE WITH ME?

01:53.939 --> 01:56.464
WE MAY AS WELL
POOL RESOURCES.

01:56.464 --> 02:00.468
OH, WELL, UM, THE LORE
ON THE HARVESTER

02:00.468 --> 02:02.122
IS NONEXISTENT,

02:02.122 --> 02:06.474
BUT I HAVE HAD SOME
LUCK ON THE BLADES.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.128
SUPPOSEDLY
WU JIAN'S SWORDS

02:08.128 --> 02:09.694
EACH HAVE A DISTINCT FUNCTION.

02:09.694 --> 02:12.175
ONE BLADE REAPS SOULS,
CAPTURING THEM,

02:12.175 --> 02:13.785
THE OTHER CHANNELS THEM,

02:13.785 --> 02:15.831
IN THIS CASE SENDING
THEM TO XIAO.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.702
THIS IS...?

02:17.702 --> 02:19.313
BASED ON THE ETCHING
ON THE HANDLE,

02:19.313 --> 02:21.271
THIS ONE'S THE REAPER.

02:21.271 --> 02:25.536
INTERESTING, BUT IT
WON'T ACTUALLY HELP US
FIND THE BASTARD.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.018
WAIT. WHAT ARE THESE?

02:29.018 --> 02:31.151
IT'S SAID THAT THE SWORDS
ARE SO PERFECTLY ATTUNED

02:31.151 --> 02:32.978
THAT THEY CALL OUT
TO EACH OTHER WHEN
THEY'RE SEPARATED,

02:32.978 --> 02:35.590
LIKE A BEACON.

02:36.939 --> 02:40.725
HE HAS ONE BLADE,
AND WE HAVE THE OTHER.

02:43.337 --> 02:46.035
WE COULD USE IT
TO BRING HIM TO US.

02:47.297 --> 02:49.473
SO, BO,
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

02:49.473 --> 02:52.737
OH. I'M, UH, FROM
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.653
MEI-LI: AND YOUR PARENTS,
WHERE ARE THEY?

02:55.653 --> 02:59.527
THEY ARE NOT
REALLY IN THE PICTURE.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.398
OH. SORRY.

03:01.398 --> 03:05.228
HONESTLY,
MY LIFE IS PRETTY DULL,

03:05.228 --> 03:06.882
NOTHING LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER'S.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.100
HMM?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.667
BO AND I HAD THE TALK.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.234
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.236
WELL, NOT EVERYTHING.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.412
THERE ARE SOME DETAILS
THAT I'M STILL
PRETTY FUZZY ON.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.414
EH, TO BE CLEAR,
NICKY WAS PRETTY NORMAL

03:17.414 --> 03:19.938
BEFORE SHE LEFT FOR CHINA
AND MET HER SHIFU HERE.

03:21.549 --> 03:24.204
OH, THAT'S YOUR SHIFU.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.425
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SHE WAS DEAD.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.384
I CAME BACK.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.431
IT HAPPENED
RIGHT AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE.

03:34.431 --> 03:37.086
UM, I CAN EXPLAIN. UM...

03:37.086 --> 03:39.088
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LET'S TALK OVER DESSERT.

03:40.698 --> 03:42.352
PEI-LING: GOOD IDEA.

03:42.352 --> 03:45.050
YOU KNOW, I WOULD,
UH, BUT I CAN'T STAY.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.269
PEI-LING: REALLY?

03:46.269 --> 03:47.357
I--I JUST REMEMBERED,

03:47.357 --> 03:49.359
I'VE GOT AN EARLY SHIFT.

03:49.359 --> 03:51.753
I'M SORRY. THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR DINNER.

03:51.753 --> 03:52.841
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.589
EVERYTHING OK?

04:01.589 --> 04:05.723
UH, YEAH.
NO, IT'S FINE, I PROMISE.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.073
HEY, SHOULD I
COME OVER LATER?

04:08.073 --> 04:10.946
LIKE I SAID, I'VE GOT
AN EARLY SHIFT.

04:10.946 --> 04:14.428
UH, BUT ANOTHER
TIME, ALL RIGHT?

04:40.802 --> 04:42.499
BO.

04:42.499 --> 04:45.154
SHIFU.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.461
I WAS WORRIED.
YOU'VE BEEN SILENT.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.506
I WOULD NEVER ABANDON YOU.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.639
YOU RECEIVED THE SOULS
I REAPED FOR YOU?

04:51.639 --> 04:53.945
YOU SAID THEY WOULD BE
ENOUGH TO BRING YOU BACK.

04:53.945 --> 04:58.298
I FACED A MINOR
OBSTACLE--MY VESSEL.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.517
NICKY'S SHIFU--
PEI-LING.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.606
YES, MY SON.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.130
YOU GAVE ME THE POWER
I NEED,

05:05.130 --> 05:08.046
BUT I HAVE
ONE LAST TASK FOR YOU.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.613
PEI-LING IMPRISONED ME

05:09.613 --> 05:11.876
AND LEFT ME HERE TO ROT.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.139
ONLY YOU CAN HELP ME
CLAIM MY VESSEL.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.490
ONLY YOU CAN FREE ME.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.492
I CROSSED WITH NICKY
IN THE WASTELAND.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.668
WE FOUGHT.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.366
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
WE'D BE WORKING
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

05:23.366 --> 05:27.501
YOU SAID
SHE WAS IMPORTANT,
TO EARN HER TRUST.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.980
BUT I NEVER
REALIZED--

05:28.980 --> 05:30.678
I WOULD ASK YOU
TO BREAK IT?

05:32.375 --> 05:33.637
SHE'LL TRY
TO STOP ME.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.378
THEN LET HER TRY.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.163
IT IS TIME TO EXPLOIT
HER TRUST

05:38.163 --> 05:42.342
AND FREE ME AT LAST.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.387
YES, SHIFU.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.360
GOT IT.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.755
THANK YOU.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.547
IS PO PO COMING
TO VISIT?

06:13.547 --> 06:15.026
NOPE.

06:15.026 --> 06:17.420
UH-OH. SAD CLEAN. SEB?

06:17.420 --> 06:19.117
YEAH.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.685
SHE'S BEEN AVOIDING
THE RESTAURANT
SINCE HE LEFT.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.906
MAMA...

06:24.906 --> 06:26.429
PACKAGE FROM CARRIE.

06:26.429 --> 06:29.127
OOH!

06:33.262 --> 06:35.786
"MAMA SHEN'S
FROZEN DUMPLINGS."

06:35.786 --> 06:38.572
YOU ARE GOING
TO BE FAMOUS.

06:38.572 --> 06:41.966
YEAH, AS A CARTOON.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.577
EXCUSE ME.

06:43.577 --> 06:46.231
LET HER GO.

06:46.231 --> 06:49.060
CLEANING'S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES HER FEEL GOOD.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.411
SO, UH, BO LEFT IN
A HURRY LAST NIGHT.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.064
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM HIM SINCE?

06:53.064 --> 06:56.720
NOPE. MAYBE ALL THE MAGIC
STUFF FREAKED HIM OUT.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.461
HE WAS PROBABLY JUST
BUMMED YOU WEREN'T ALONE
WHEN HE SHOWED UP.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.986
OH. SEE? THAT'S
PROBABLY HIM RIGHT NOW.

07:13.607 --> 07:14.956
GOOD MORNING, ALTHEA.

07:14.956 --> 07:16.610
I GOT A COUPLE HOURS
FREE THURSDAY.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.786
I DON'T.
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT?

07:18.786 --> 07:21.136
LATE DINNER AT
OAK BRANCH?

07:21.136 --> 07:23.573
THAT SOUNDS
AMAZING, BUT...

07:23.573 --> 07:25.662
WE'RE SWAMPED HERE.

07:25.662 --> 07:30.493
SEE YOU WHEN I SEE YOU.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.153
WHAT?

07:38.153 --> 07:40.198
NOTHING, NOTHING.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.941
SANDY VASILO?

07:43.941 --> 07:45.813
HI. COME ON IN.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.207
HI, SANDY.
EVAN HARTLEY.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.601
HOW CAN WE
HELP YOU?

07:51.601 --> 07:53.473
I NEED TO GET
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.476
MY EX, I THINK
HE'S STALKING ME.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.306
WELL?

08:01.306 --> 08:02.525
I'M NOT SURE.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.179
WHY? IT'S A GOOD PLAN.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.789
USE THE BLADE TO DRAW OUT
THE HARVESTER.

08:05.789 --> 08:06.964
WE'D HAVE HOME-FIELD

08:06.964 --> 08:08.139
TAKE HIM
BY SURPRISE.

08:08.139 --> 08:09.706
NO. I GET IT. IT'S JUST--

08:09.706 --> 08:11.795
HE ONLY HAS
HALF A SWORD NOW.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.536
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE'S
TRAPPED IN THAT WASTELAND,

08:13.536 --> 08:15.973
SO HOW IS DRAWING HIM OUT
OUR PRIORITY?

08:15.973 --> 08:18.498
XIAO IS THE THREAT
TO PEI-LING.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.673
BUT SHE'S TRAPPED
RIGHT NOW.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.239
SHE'S STILL DANGEROUS.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.806
PEI-LING SAID SHE CAN
FEEL HER TRYING

08:22.806 --> 08:24.678
TO GET OUT OF HER CAGE.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.899
A WAY OUT.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.379
MAYBE THAT'S OUR PLAY.

08:32.207 --> 08:35.253
THIS SWORD IS DESIGNED
TO REAP SOULS, RIGHT?

08:35.253 --> 08:36.994
SUCK THEM OUT LIKE
A VACUUM?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.996
WE SAW IT IN ACTION
IN THE WASTELAND.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.215
IF WE CAN GET IT TO WORK...

08:40.215 --> 08:41.825
WE CAN USE IT
TO PULL XIAO OUT.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.087
AND WITHOUT THE OTHER SWORD
TO TRANSFER HER,

08:43.087 --> 08:44.654
SHE'D HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.439
SHE'D BE TRAPPED PERMANENTLY.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.578
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY,
ISN'T IT?

08:55.578 --> 08:57.580
AHH. IT'S A BEER.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.062
OH. DID YOU CALL ANY OF
THOSE RESTAURANTS?

09:01.062 --> 09:02.933
NOPE.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.678
LISTEN, SEB,
I KNOW IT SUCKS.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.680
YOU HAD A GOOD THING
GOING AT HARMONY,

09:10.680 --> 09:13.553
BUT THAT PROFILE?
YOU GOT HEAT.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.380
CHEZ HAUS HAS BEEN
BLOWING UP YOUR PHONE.

09:15.380 --> 09:18.427
GREAT. NOW I'LL FINALLY
FULFILL MY DREAM

09:18.427 --> 09:21.691
OF TWEEZING TINY FLOWERS
ON A $40 DESSERT.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.262
IT'S NICKY.
SHE NEEDS HELP.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.573
YEAH, IT'S A BIG NEW
PLAN, ACTUALLY.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.749
IT SOUNDS KIND OF DANGEROUS.

09:35.749 --> 09:39.230
COULD REALLY USE
THE EXTRA MUSCLE.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.971
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.973
IS IT WORKING?

09:44.192 --> 09:46.150
THAT'S SANDY'S APARTMENT.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.109
SHE THINKS HER EX
IS SPYING ON HER
FROM THAT WINDOW.

09:48.109 --> 09:50.590
FROM THIS TREE?
THAT'S A HELL OF A CLIMB.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.982
UH-HUH.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.811
THERE'S A CAMERA
IN THE TREE.

09:54.811 --> 09:57.422
DO YOU THINK HER EX
PUT IT UP THERE?

09:57.422 --> 10:00.904
NOT UNLESS HE'S
GOT GIRLFRIENDS ALL UP
AND DOWN THIS STREET.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.822
HMM, COMMERCIAL VAN,
NO LOGO.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.651
I NEED TO TAKE A LOOK
INSIDE. COVER ME?

10:08.651 --> 10:10.044
MM-HMM.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.269
WE'RE USING A MAGIC SWORD

10:18.269 --> 10:20.445
TO SUCK AN EVIL SPIRIT
OUT OF PEI-LING.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.491
THAT'S THE PLAN.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.841
ACCORDING TO THE LORE,
THE SWORD IS
POWERED BY ITS TWIN,

10:24.841 --> 10:26.930
SO OUR SOUL-SUCKING SWORD
IS BASICALLY DEAD.

10:26.930 --> 10:29.367
YOU MEAN WE NEED
TO FIND
A NEW POWER SOURCE.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.543
AREN'T YOU SOME
KIND OF MAGICAL GPS NOW?
CAN'T YOU FIND ONE?

10:31.543 --> 10:33.197
YEAH, IT DOESN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

10:33.197 --> 10:34.808
I GOT TO KNOW WHAT
I'M LOOKING FOR FIRST.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.026
WHAT ABOUT LIGHTNING?

10:36.026 --> 10:37.680
SO WHAT,

10:37.680 --> 10:39.639
STRAP THE SWORD TO THE ROOF
AND PRAY FOR RAIN?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.292
UH, OK. YEAH. DUMB IDEA.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.817
NO, NO, IT'S NOT.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.383
I MEAN, WHO SAYS IT
HAS TO BE MAGIC?

10:45.383 --> 10:48.038
WHAT IF WE JUST
PLUG IT IN?

10:48.038 --> 10:50.127
ENERGY IS ENERGY.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.694
WE'D HAVE TO TEST IT
BUT, OCCAM'S RAZOR,

10:51.694 --> 10:53.304
MAYBE SIMPLE IS BEST.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.350
LET'S JUST SAY THE SWORD
TAKES 120 VOLTS.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.787
THERE'S STILL A MAJOR
FLAW IN THIS PLAN.

10:57.787 --> 11:00.311
XIAO ISN'T JUST
TRAPPED INSIDE PEI-LING,

11:00.311 --> 11:03.358
SHE'S STUCK
INSIDE HER CAGE.

11:03.358 --> 11:07.971
FOR THE PLAN TO WORK, I WOULD
HAVE TO RELEASE HER FIRST.

11:07.971 --> 11:10.408
SHE'D TAKE YOU OVER
BEFORE THE REST OF YOU

11:10.408 --> 11:12.976
EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO PUT ON
YOUR "GHOSTBUSTERS" SUITS.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.499
YOU MAKE MOVIE
REFERENCES?

11:14.499 --> 11:16.153
WAIT.
YOU WATCH MOVIES?

11:16.153 --> 11:17.677
ZHILAN'S RIGHT. MAYBE
THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.504
PERHAPS NOT.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.724
THE LAST TIME XIAO
TOOK CONTROL OF MY BODY,

11:21.724 --> 11:24.727
IT WAS AS IF HER
FINGERS WERE WRAPPED
AROUND MY MIND.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.556
HOWEVER, IF I COULD
COMPLETELY CLEAR MY MIND

11:27.556 --> 11:29.689
THROUGH DEEP MEDIATION...

11:29.689 --> 11:31.342
XIAO WON'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO LATCH ONTO,

11:31.342 --> 11:32.822
BUYING US TIME
TO CATCH HER.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.998
I BELIEVE IT
WOULD WORK, NICKY.

11:34.998 --> 11:39.742
HOWEVER, THAT LEVEL OF
MEDITATION REQUIRES
COMPLETE FOCUS.

11:39.742 --> 11:43.180
I FEAR MY MIND...

11:43.180 --> 11:44.878
IT IS NOT STILL.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.402
ZHILAN.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.839
I DO NOT WANT TO PUSH,

11:49.839 --> 11:52.233
BUT SHE COULD BARELY
LOOK AT ME.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.062
WELL...

11:56.628 --> 11:58.369
SHE DID MURDER YOU.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.851
FATE HAS BROUGHT US TOGETHER,

12:01.851 --> 12:02.939
AND I BELIEVE

12:02.939 --> 12:05.028
THERE IS A REASON.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.552
UNTIL WE SPEAK...

12:07.552 --> 12:10.251
SHE'S MY SISTER, NICKY.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.732
YOU HELPED ME FIND
PEACE WITH MY FAMILY.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.516
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.609
GO.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.446
THOUGHT YOU GOT SPOOKED.

12:31.446 --> 12:34.057
WAS IT THE MAGIC TALK

12:34.057 --> 12:35.798
OR THE 6-COURSE DINNER?

12:35.798 --> 12:38.758
NONE OF THE ABOVE, PROMISE.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.977
I WAS JUST BUSY. IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU'RE PRETTY BUSY, TOO.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.588
ACTUALLY, I AM.

12:43.588 --> 12:46.243
WELL, MY SCHEDULE'S CLEAR.

12:46.243 --> 12:49.116
IF YOU NEED MY HELP,
I'M IN.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.334
REALLY?

12:50.334 --> 12:52.336
REALLY.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.685
OK.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.524
A FULL HOUSE.

13:06.524 --> 13:09.136
YOU SURE THERE'S ROOM
ON THE TEAM FOR ONE MORE?

13:10.311 --> 13:12.661
BO, HEY.
TESTING A THEORY.

13:15.882 --> 13:20.103
SEEING IF
CONVENTIONAL ELECTRICITY
CAN ACTIVATE A SWORD.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.018
UH, SHE EXPLAIN
THE SWORD TO YOU?

13:22.018 --> 13:23.367
YEAH.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.282
CAR BATTERY TEST.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.632
MY IDEA UNLESS
IT DOESN'T WORK.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.200
HOLD ONTO YOUR BUTTS.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.041
IT--IT WORKED.
MY IDEA.

13:45.041 --> 13:48.349
UH, WE'RE GONNA
NEED A LOT MORE JUICE
TO SUCK XIAO IN.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.394
WELL, IF WE TAP
INTO THE BUILDING'S
POWER SUPPLY,

13:50.394 --> 13:53.006
UP THE TRIP SETTING,
THAT COULD DO THE TRICK.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.051
FIGHTER, HACKER,
AND ELECTRICIAN?

13:55.051 --> 13:57.010
NO.
AMATEUR ELECTRICIAN.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.142
I'LL NEED SOME
HEAVY-DUTY CABLES, CLAMPS...

13:59.142 --> 14:00.752
SEB AND I CAN DO
THE HARDWARE RUN.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.189
BREAKER'S THIS WAY.

14:10.545 --> 14:13.417
UM, HELLO!

14:13.417 --> 14:16.551
THERE IS A BIRD UP THERE,
AND YOU ARE DISTURBING
ITS HABITAT.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.553
OH, YEAH? WHAT KIND?

14:18.553 --> 14:21.164
A GREEN SPECKLED...

14:21.164 --> 14:22.862
THRUSH.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.779
YOU'RE A BIRDER, TOO?

14:27.779 --> 14:29.607
UH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

14:29.607 --> 14:31.783
BIRDING IS MY PASSION.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.698
YOU GOT TO CATCH
'EM ALL. HEH!

14:37.180 --> 14:38.268
BUT ARE YOU SURE
YOU SAID GREEN?

14:38.268 --> 14:40.705
UH, DID I SAY "GREEN"?

14:40.705 --> 14:42.403
I MEANT BROWN.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.274
- BROWN?
- MM-HMM.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.189
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU SAW
A BICKNELL'S THRUSH HERE?

14:46.189 --> 14:49.889
YES, YES!
IT'S VERY EXCITING.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.461
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
UM, AHEM.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.115
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:59.115 --> 15:02.423
TO GET MY BINOCULARS.
IT COULD STILL BE NEARBY.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.381
OH. UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T BOTHER.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.906
I JUST REALIZED
IT'S A PIGEON. HA HA.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.124
SORRY. STILL A NOVICE.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.647
HAPPY BIRDING.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.222
VANDALISM?

15:19.222 --> 15:20.963
REALLY?

15:22.356 --> 15:24.227
ONE OF THE EMPEROR'S
RUNES,

15:24.227 --> 15:26.838
THE SAME ONES PEI-LING
USED TO TRAP XIAO.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.753
I'M PLACING THEM ALL
OVER THE BUILDING,

15:28.753 --> 15:30.668
A FAIL-SAFE.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.757
SO IF YOUR PLAN GOES
WRONG AND XIAO
TRIES TO ESCAPE,

15:32.757 --> 15:34.281
SHE'LL BE TRAPPED HERE.

15:34.281 --> 15:37.284
SMART...

15:37.284 --> 15:42.506
BUT MY PLAN
WON'T WORK UNLESS
YOU TALK TO YOUR SISTER.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.334
THERE'S NO POINT.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.685
FORGIVENESS
IS OFF THE TABLE.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.296
SHE'S NOT
YOUR MOTHER.

15:51.994 --> 15:53.865
SHE WON'T
REJECT YOU.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.086
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

15:57.086 --> 15:58.653
I DO.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.440
RIGHT NOW, PEI-LING
IS ON THE BRINK

16:03.440 --> 16:05.442
OF FREEING HERSELF
FROM THIS MONSTER

16:05.442 --> 16:08.706
WHO'S BEEN TORMENTING
HER FOR MONTHS,

16:08.706 --> 16:11.840
AND ALL SHE CAN
THINK ABOUT IS YOU.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.279
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING THERE?

16:16.279 --> 16:18.716
ADJUSTING THE SETTINGS
SO THE EXTRA JUICE
WON'T TRIP THE BREAKERS.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.457
AMATEUR, MY ASS.

16:20.457 --> 16:23.373
YOU COULD BE MAKING
GOOD MONEY.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.636
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SLINGING LATTES?

16:25.636 --> 16:27.812
NOT MUCH AVAILABLE
WHEN I GOT TO THE BAY,

16:27.812 --> 16:29.510
WELL, EARTHQUAKE AND ALL.

16:29.510 --> 16:32.034
SO YOU PACKED UP
AND MOVED TO A CITY

16:32.034 --> 16:34.036
THAT WAS JUST
DEVASTATED BY A BIG ONE?

16:34.036 --> 16:36.038
THAT'S SOME TIMING
YOU GOT.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.301
YEAH.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.651
WELL,
DONE WITH THE BREAKERS.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.176
NOW I JUST NEED TO RIG
THE OUTLET IN THE LIBRARY.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.220
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.700
SOUNDS GOOD.

16:58.713 --> 17:00.236
SISTER?

17:04.197 --> 17:06.503
NICKY THINKS THAT, UH...

17:06.503 --> 17:08.331
WE SHOULD TALK.

17:08.331 --> 17:11.247
BUT I KNOW WHAT I DID.

17:11.247 --> 17:14.381
I KNOW WHAT I
LET MYSELF BECOME.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.081
I AM SORRY.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.692
BUT WHAT GOOD
IS MY APOLOGY WHEN--

17:21.692 --> 17:26.262
ZHILAN, YOUR APOLOGY
IS NOT WHAT I SEEK.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.438
W--WHAT?

17:29.744 --> 17:31.615
THE NIGHT OUR FATHER DIED--

17:31.615 --> 17:33.226
DON'T TALK ABOUT--
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

17:33.226 --> 17:37.186
YES, BUT LEAVING YOU
WAS A CHOICE.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.188
I RAN AWAY...

17:39.188 --> 17:41.364
TO PROTECT YOU.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.279
BUT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
STRONGER TOGETHER.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.933
YOU ARE RIGHT, SISTER.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.805
WHAT CAME AFTER,
WHAT YOU DID...

17:47.805 --> 17:49.720
I CANNOT ABSOLVE YOU,

17:49.720 --> 17:53.594
BUT I CAN
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MY ACTIONS.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.989
I LEFT YOU.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.776
IT IS MY ONE REGRET,

18:01.776 --> 18:07.216
AND IT HAS HAUNTED ME
IN MY LIFE

18:07.216 --> 18:09.262
AND IN MY DEATH.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.441
WILL YOU FORGIVE ME?

18:17.008 --> 18:18.488
YES.

18:21.056 --> 18:22.623
SISTER.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.159
THIS CAMPAIGN IS A LONGSHOT,

18:37.159 --> 18:38.987
SO I PUT IN SOME CALLS,

18:38.987 --> 18:41.337
BOOKED YOU A SPOT ON
"THE BAY I SEE IT,"

18:41.337 --> 18:42.599
A PODCAST,

18:42.599 --> 18:44.123
HUGE LISTENER BASE
IN CHINATOWN.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.037
OH. AN INTERVIEW.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.822
MORE OF A VERBAL ASSAULT.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.041
THE HOST LOVES SKEWERING POLITICIANS.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.043
THAT'S HIS THING,
WHAT MAKES HIM SO POPULAR.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.654
OK.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.832
DON'T WORRY. I'LL PREP YOU
FOR THE SESSION TONIGHT.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.488
TONIGHT?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.146
POWER'S SET.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.365
BUILDING'S EMPTY.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.628
READY?

19:11.628 --> 19:13.848
I AM NOW.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.459
OK. WHEN WE HIT
THE POWER,

19:16.459 --> 19:18.069
THE HARVESTER'S
SWORD WILL CHARGE,

19:18.069 --> 19:20.289
PEI-LING WILL RELEASE
XIAO FROM HER CAGE,

19:20.289 --> 19:22.987
THE SWORD WILL ACTIVATE,
AND IT SHOULD PULL XIAO OUT,

19:22.987 --> 19:24.641
TRAPPING HER INSIDE.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.121
IF IT DOESN'T?

19:27.383 --> 19:28.863
THEN BE READY
FOR A FIGHT.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.226
SHIFU, LET HER OUT.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.198
IT'S WORKING.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.252
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:10.252 --> 20:11.688
OLD WIRING.
MUST'VE GIVEN OUT.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.255
CAN YOU PUT HER BACK
IN THE CAGE?

20:13.255 --> 20:15.692
IT IS TOO LATE. I DO
NOT FEEL XIAO ANYMORE.

20:15.692 --> 20:18.260
IF SHE'S NOT
IN YOU AND SHE'S NOT
IN THE SWORD, THEN...

20:18.260 --> 20:19.827
WHERE THE HELL
IS SHE?

20:27.574 --> 20:29.750
SO XIAO'S SPIRIT IS
JUST ON THE LOOSE?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.578
WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.
WE JUST HAVE TO STAY CALM.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.971
CALM? WE JUST SET
THE BIG BAD FREE.
SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

20:33.971 --> 20:37.279
NOT ANYWHERE. I CARVED
RUNES ALL OVER THE CENTER.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.889
XIAO CAN'T LEAVE.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.630
SO SHE'S TRAPPED
IN HERE WITH US?

20:40.630 --> 20:42.589
FUNNY, NOT MAKING ME
ANY LESS SCARED.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.417
SHOULD WE, UH,
LOOK FOR HER?

20:44.417 --> 20:45.766
LOOK FOR WHAT?
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
XIAO'S SOUL LOOKS LIKE.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.377
PEI-LING: XIAO
HID IN ME FOR MONTHS.

20:48.377 --> 20:49.900
I SUSPECT
IF SHE GOT FREE...

20:49.900 --> 20:51.946
SHE'S IN ONE OF US.

20:55.471 --> 20:58.126
OK, WHO WAS
CLOSEST TO PEI-LING
WHEN XIAO GOT OUT?

20:58.126 --> 20:59.823
ZHILAN WAS
RIGHT NEXT TO HER.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.303
AND WHO ELSE WAS
NEXT TO HER?

21:01.303 --> 21:02.826
RIGHT, UH, ME.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.438
HENRY, CAN YOU USE
YOUR COMPASS POWER?

21:05.438 --> 21:07.570
I'M TRYING. I CAN'T
FEEL ANYTHING.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.486
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
IF XIAO IS IN ONE OF US,

21:10.486 --> 21:12.401
THEN WE NEED TO FIND
A WAY TO SMOKE HER OUT.

21:12.401 --> 21:16.449
IN THE MEANTIME, NO ONE
LEAVES THIS BUILDING.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.974
YOU
WORKED FOR ANTHONY CHAN.

21:19.974 --> 21:21.584
WHY'D YOU LEAVE
HIS CAMPAIGN?

21:21.584 --> 21:23.586
UH...

21:23.586 --> 21:25.588
JUST STICK TO THE SCRIPT.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.938
OK.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.418
"ANTHONY AND I HAD

21:29.418 --> 21:31.333
"A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.

21:31.333 --> 21:35.598
I AM RUNNING
FOR MY COMMUNITY
AND NOT AGAINST HIM."

21:35.598 --> 21:37.992
WHAT? I'M READING THE CARD.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.994
NEXT TIME
LIKE YOU MEAN IT?

21:39.994 --> 21:41.996
OK.

21:43.476 --> 21:46.000
IF YOU CAN'T STAY LOYAL
TO YOUR OWN CANDIDATE,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.568
HOW CAN PEOPLE EXPECT YOU TO
STAY LOYAL TO THE COMMUNITY?

21:52.485 --> 21:54.443
CHINATOWN'S MY HOME.

21:54.443 --> 21:58.142
I'M NOT LOOKING TO
SACRAMENTO OR WASHINGTON.

21:58.142 --> 22:01.668
I CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE HERE.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.974
EVEN IF IT'S UNPOPULAR,

22:03.974 --> 22:07.804
I'M NOT GONNA HAND
MY STREET OVER TO SOME
PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY

22:07.804 --> 22:11.808
BECAUSE I KNOW WE DON'T NEED
EXTRALEGAL POLICING.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.681
WE NEED RESOURCES.
WE NEED HELP.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.512
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WROTE.

22:19.512 --> 22:22.384
OH, I'M SORRY, HARPER.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.212
THESE PEOPLE, THEY KNOW ME.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.736
I HAVE TO SPEAK
OFF THE CUFF

22:26.736 --> 22:29.478
AND IN MY OWN VOICE.

22:29.478 --> 22:32.568
WELL, IF THAT'S YOUR VOICE,

22:32.568 --> 22:35.266
WE MIGHT HAVE A REAL SHOT.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.485
YEAH?

22:37.747 --> 22:39.575
30 MINUTES TO SHOWTIME.
LET'S GO.

22:39.575 --> 22:40.663
OK. HA HA!

22:42.012 --> 22:45.668
WHEW!

22:45.668 --> 22:46.756
WISH ME LUCK, LAO PO.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.018
LAO GONG,

22:48.018 --> 22:50.020
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA NEED IT.

22:50.020 --> 22:53.197
YOU ARE GOING TO WIN
JUST BY BEING YOURSELF.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.939
AND THAT'S WHAT I GOT
TO DO, TOO.

22:55.939 --> 22:58.768
NO MORE CLEANING,
HIDING IN THE HOUSE.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.727
THIS IS MY RESTAURANT,

23:00.727 --> 23:03.251
AND I'M GONNA
TAKE IT BACK,
EVEN IF IT MEANS WAR.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.514
WHOA. HA HA.

23:07.037 --> 23:09.039
OK, YOU AND I HAVE
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

23:09.039 --> 23:11.259
UH, SURE, NICKY, BUT
HOW DO WE KNOW...

23:11.259 --> 23:14.523
I'M NOT XIAO?
YOU DON'T, JUST LIKE I
DON'T KNOW YOU AREN'T.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.873
GOT TO ROLL THE DICE.

23:16.873 --> 23:18.701
WHEN PEI-LING
WAS POSSESSED BY XIAO,

23:18.701 --> 23:20.224
YOU RAN TESTS, RIGHT?

23:20.224 --> 23:21.791
WAS THERE SOMETHING,
ANYTHING IN HER RESULTS--

23:21.791 --> 23:23.140
NO. LIKE I TOLD YOU,

23:23.140 --> 23:24.620
PEI-LING'S BLOODWORK
CAME BACK CLEAN.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.361
I TESTED FOR EVERYTHING.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.147
- WHAT?
- EVERYTHING MEDICAL!

23:30.147 --> 23:31.888
I NEVER TESTED
FOR MAGIC.

23:31.888 --> 23:35.109
OK, XIAO LIVED
THROUGH JYU SA.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.328
SHE USED SOURCE MAGIC
TO COME TO OUR WORLD.

23:37.328 --> 23:39.330
WE STILL HAVE
SOME OF EACH.

23:39.330 --> 23:42.638
MAYBE XIAO PLUS JYU SA
PLUS SOURCE ENERGY

23:42.638 --> 23:44.248
WILL CREATE
A DISTINCT REACTION,

23:44.248 --> 23:45.989
AND IF IT DOES,
WE THEN HAVE OUR TEST.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.252
BUT WHAT WOULD
WE EVEN USE?

23:48.252 --> 23:50.864
I STILL HAVE SOME
OF PEI-LING'S LAST
BLOOD DRAW IN THE CLINIC.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.664
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

24:13.408 --> 24:15.279
JUST LOOKING
FOR THE ELECTRICAL ROOM.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.325
I HAVE TO CHECK
ONE OF THE BREAKERS.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.764
WE SHOULD GET BACK
TO THE LIBRARY.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.592
NICKY WANTS US TO STAY
CLOSE TOGETHER.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.507
YEAH.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.352
WHY DO YOU NEED MY BLOOD?

24:44.352 --> 24:46.049
CONTROL SAMPLE,

24:46.049 --> 24:47.703
THOUGH THIS WHOLE TEST
IS THEORETICAL.

24:47.703 --> 24:50.271
PEI-LING'S BLOOD
MIGHT NOT REACT.

25:03.937 --> 25:06.200
I'D CALL THAT
A REACTION.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.691
LOOKS LIKE NO XIAO.

25:18.691 --> 25:21.041
LET'S FIND OUT WHO IS.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.524
A VAN FULL OF
CAMERAS, SECRET DOCUMENTS?

25:25.524 --> 25:27.047
COULD BE BIG.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.005
THE DOCUMENTS
ARE PRETTY CRYPTIC,

25:29.005 --> 25:32.008
BUT AN ACRONYM KEEPS
"CZI."

25:32.008 --> 25:33.532
COULD THAT BE
SOME KIND OF COMPANY?

25:33.532 --> 25:35.838
I'M HEADING HOME NOW.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.884
BUT I'LL PUT OUT
SOME FEELERS.

25:37.884 --> 25:40.234
THANKS, BUG.

25:40.234 --> 25:41.583
OK, BYE.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.673
TALKED TO SANDY.

25:44.673 --> 25:47.241
SHE'S RELIEVED TO HEAR
HER EX IS NOT SPYING ON HER.

25:49.765 --> 25:52.202
NADIA TOTALLY WANTS YOU
TO COME OVER, BY THE WAY.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.030
WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHO'S BEHIND THESE CAMERAS.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.380
I MEAN, THAT
COULD TAKE ALL NIGHT.

25:56.380 --> 26:00.210
DENNIS ASIDE, YOU'RE PROBABLY
THE BEST GUY I KNOW.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.604
WITH NICKY AND THEN SABINE,

26:02.604 --> 26:04.432
YOU DON'T EXACTLY
HAVE THE BEST LUCK,

26:04.432 --> 26:05.912
AND I JUST--

26:05.912 --> 26:07.870
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO BLOW IT.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.742
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.920
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE
YOUR ADVICE.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.313
BUT I KNOW YOU, TOO, ALTHEA.

26:16.313 --> 26:18.925
WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
YOU HAVE A TENDENCY TO
FOCUS ON YOUR FRIENDS.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.927
YOU CAN BE A BIT OF A...

26:20.927 --> 26:22.276
STICKY BEAK?

26:22.276 --> 26:24.060
HA HA! I WAS GONNA
SAY FIXER.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.588
DENNIS IS IN NAPA
VISITING HIS FAMILY

26:29.588 --> 26:31.590
FOR A POTENTIALLY
DISASTROUS REUNION,

26:31.590 --> 26:33.417
A REUNION THAT WAS
TOTALLY MY IDEA.

26:33.417 --> 26:36.464
AND...I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HIM ALL DAY.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.640
I'M SURE IT'LL BE OK.

26:41.121 --> 26:43.514
OH. NADIA FOUND
SOMETHING ON CZI.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.604
IT'S NOT A COMPANY.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.954
IT'S A NEW ORDINANCE
HEADED TO
THE MAYOR'S DESK--

26:47.954 --> 26:50.130
THE CRIME ZERO INITIATIVE.

26:51.871 --> 26:53.612
THAT WAS
THE LAST DRAW.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.964
HEY.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.749
I'M SORRY. I WANTED
TO DISTRACT YOU.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.359
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

27:02.359 --> 27:05.449
HONESTLY, IT'S BEEN
PRETTY CREEPY,

27:05.449 --> 27:07.147
BUT, UH...

27:12.369 --> 27:14.110
ARE WE DOING THIS
OR WHAT?

27:14.110 --> 27:16.286
PRETTY
DAMN DISTRACTING.

27:18.114 --> 27:21.161
UM, SORRY.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.206
OK, NICKY'S CLEAR.

27:23.206 --> 27:26.035
IT'S MY TEST,
ONLY FAIR I GO FIRST.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.350
I'M CLEAR.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.526
PEI-LING?

27:41.703 --> 27:44.271
OK, BOTH CLEAR.
ZHILAN'S TURN.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.147
NO REACTION.

27:51.147 --> 27:53.019
SEB, YOU'RE UP.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.028
SEB'S CLEAR.

28:02.028 --> 28:05.509
HENRY'S NEXT.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.381
WELL, I'M SATISFIED.

28:09.209 --> 28:11.559
I SAW HIM IN THE HALL.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.082
HE WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK
OUT ONE OF THE RUNES.

28:13.082 --> 28:15.041
I WAS JUST LOOKING.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.738
BUT, LOOK, I'M NOT THE ONE
TRYING TO SKIP MY TURN.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.000
SO...

28:18.000 --> 28:19.872
GO ON.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.049
TEST ME.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.623
BO'S CLEAR.

28:44.070 --> 28:46.855
NO.
TIE HIM UP.

28:46.855 --> 28:48.596
- NICKY.
- HENRY...

28:48.596 --> 28:49.640
WE WILL FIGURE
THIS OUT.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.641
WE'LL GET HER OUT OF YOU.

28:50.641 --> 28:51.904
SHE'S NOT IN ME.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.383
RYAN, TAKE MORE BLOOD.
DO IT AGAIN.

28:53.383 --> 28:54.776
GET OFF OF ME.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.082
HEY, MAN, CALM DOWN.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.474
NO, NO.
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

28:57.474 --> 28:58.954
THEY WERE IN ORDER.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.739
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO TOUCHED THEM.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.916
IT'S NOT HENRY. SOMEONE
SWITCHED THE LIDS.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.273
GOT ME.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.411
XIAO, LET HIM GO.

29:21.411 --> 29:23.805
WHY?

29:23.805 --> 29:26.590
SO YOU CAN TRAP ME
AGAIN?

29:26.590 --> 29:28.810
OH, BESIDES...

29:28.810 --> 29:30.551
I'M STARTING
TO LIKE THIS ONE.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.251
ZHILAN, WAIT!

29:35.251 --> 29:36.905
XIAO WILL DESTROY
THE RUNES.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.515
SHE COULD ESCAPE.
SHE NEEDS TO PAY.

29:38.515 --> 29:39.995
DON'T HURT SEB.
HE'S STILL IN THERE.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.084
OK, WHEN WE FIND XIAO,
WE SUBDUE HER.

29:42.084 --> 29:43.694
WE GOT TO GET
THE POWER BACK ON.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.609
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO TRAP
XIAO AND SAVE SEBASTIAN.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.089
I'M ON IT.
I'M COMING.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.091
NO.
IT'S SEB. I HAVE TO.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.659
THERE ARE 3 RUNES.
IF XIAO BREAKS JUST ONE
OF THEM, SHE'S GONE.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.797
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.537
WE GET THE POWER
BACK, THEN--

30:00.537 --> 30:02.626
GONNA CHARGE UP THE SWORD,

30:02.626 --> 30:05.368
THEN RIP THE SOUL-SUCKING
WITCH OUT OF SEB.

30:08.154 --> 30:11.766
OK, GO. JUST
RESET THE BREAKER.
I'LL HOLD HER BACK.

30:32.004 --> 30:35.877
SHIFU, IT'S REALLY YOU.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.619
I SUPPOSE I HAVE YOU
TO THANK.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.405
I, UH, LOWERED
THE TRIP SETTING
ON THE BREAKER BOX,

30:42.405 --> 30:44.407
MADE SURE THEIR PLAN
TO TRAP YOU WOULD FAIL.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.061
THEY ARE TRYING AGAIN.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.543
LET THEM.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.374
AND THIS VESSEL.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.985
A MEANS TO AN END.
I WON'T NEED HIM LONG.

30:56.985 --> 30:59.509
SO YOU WON'T HURT THEM?

30:59.509 --> 31:01.120
NO.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.254
SORRY, CHILD.

31:05.254 --> 31:08.649
THEY MUST BELIEVE WE FOUGHT.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.917
THIS ONE'S SAFE.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.093
BUT WHERE'S XIAO?

31:31.454 --> 31:34.588
WHEN WE LAST FOUGHT,
I WAS JUST A SPIRIT.

31:34.588 --> 31:37.634
YOU HAD THE ADVANTAGE.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.593
NOT ANYMORE.

31:55.522 --> 31:58.307
YOU ARE PULLING
YOUR PUNCHES, WARRIOR.

31:58.307 --> 32:02.833
WHAT, AFRAID YOU
MIGHT HURT YOUR CHEF?

32:04.487 --> 32:09.623
AS ALWAYS, YOUR
CONNECTIONS MAKE YOU WEAK.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.625
HYAH! HYAH!

32:18.023 --> 32:20.112
HEY. YOU GUYS OK?

32:20.112 --> 32:22.679
I FLIPPED THE BREAKER,
BUT THE POWER'S STILL OUT.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.507
THE MAIN BREAKER'S
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.074
I COULD TRY THAT.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.163
THEN WE CHARGE UP
THE SWORD, FIND XIAO.

32:28.163 --> 32:30.339
YEAH, BUT IF
SHE'S BROKEN THE RUNES,
SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

32:36.998 --> 32:39.609
WE SHOULD KEEP LOOKING
FOR XIAO.

32:39.609 --> 32:41.350
LET THE OTHERS FIND HER.

32:41.350 --> 32:44.440
WE CAN PROTECT THIS RUNE,
AND I CAN PROTECT YOU.

32:44.440 --> 32:48.140
OR, SISTER, WE COULD
STOP HER TOGETHER.

32:48.140 --> 32:51.491
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.624
IF YOU'RE HERE
TO BREAK THE RUNE...

32:54.624 --> 32:56.278
WE WILL STOP YOU.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.454
THE RUNES!

32:58.454 --> 33:01.849
THE RUNES ARE NOT
WHY I AM HERE.

33:01.849 --> 33:07.811
DID YOU THINK I WAS FINISHED
WITH YOU, PEI-LING?

33:07.811 --> 33:11.467
THIS, THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY.

33:11.467 --> 33:14.383
I STILL NEED YOU...

33:14.383 --> 33:16.516
YOUR BODY.

33:16.516 --> 33:19.693
THE SOULS OF THE WARRIORS
AND THE GUARDIANS,

33:19.693 --> 33:22.696
WHEN I CONSUMED THEM,
THEIR POWER BECAME
A PART OF US BOTH.

33:22.696 --> 33:27.005
AND I AM GOING TO NEED
ALL OF IT.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.253
YOU FORGET, GUARDIAN,

33:58.253 --> 33:59.950
I KNOW ALL OF
YOUR WEAKNESSES.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.257
HYAH! UH!

34:02.257 --> 34:04.259
- HYAH!
- UH! UH!

34:08.350 --> 34:13.094
YOUR SPINE,
ALL YOUR SURGERIES.

34:20.406 --> 34:25.889
AH, YOUR FRIENDS HAVEN'T
GIVEN UP, BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.937
I WILL KILL HER...

34:29.937 --> 34:36.378
UNLESS, HER LIFE
FOR YOUR BODY.

34:36.378 --> 34:39.555
SISTER, NO.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.905
LET HER GO, XIAO.

34:41.905 --> 34:45.692
SORRY, WARRIOR.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.392
SPARE HER.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.090
PEI-LING, NO.
PEI-LING: TAKE ME.

34:53.439 --> 34:56.094
UH! UH!

34:59.401 --> 35:00.968
NICKY!

35:15.200 --> 35:18.290
WE DID IT.
XIAO'S TRAPPED.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.030
SEB!

35:29.301 --> 35:30.519
SHE GOT YOU PRETTY GOOD.

35:30.519 --> 35:34.523
YEAH. SORRY I MISSED
ALL THE ACTION.

35:34.523 --> 35:37.657
TAKING ON XIAO
ALONE? KIND OF STUPID...

35:37.657 --> 35:40.138
BUT PRETTY BRAVE.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.704
SEB, ARE YOU OK?

35:41.704 --> 35:44.533
HE'S PRETTY WIPED.
I GOT TO GET HIM HOME.

35:46.187 --> 35:50.191
PEI-LING,
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

35:50.191 --> 35:54.064
PEI-LING:
I AM FEELING HUNGRY.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.371
MAMA'S PROBABLY
MAKING DINNER.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.504
THE MORE, THE MERRIER.

35:58.504 --> 36:01.768
ZHILAN, WILL YOU BE
JOINING US THIS TIME?

36:06.207 --> 36:08.166
SURE.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.516
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO FIRST.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.914
I'M PICKING UP
A BOTTLE OF WINE
FOR DINNER.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.916
I'M NOT A SAVAGE.

36:24.530 --> 36:27.663
AMAZING HOW THIS
LITTLE THING CAN CONTAIN

36:27.663 --> 36:29.491
SO MUCH EVIL.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.189
THE SWORD'S
POWERED UP.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.929
IT COULD START
CALLING OUT
TO ITS TWIN.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.931
IT MIGHT LEAD
THE HARVESTER
RIGHT TO US.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.498
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DESTROY IT
WITHOUT RELEASING XIAO.

36:36.498 --> 36:38.718
IN THE MEANTIME--

36:38.718 --> 36:40.676
WE GOT
TO HIDE IT
SOMEPLACE SAFE.

36:40.676 --> 36:42.678
YOU GUYS FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DESTROY IT.

36:42.678 --> 36:45.507
I'LL HIDE IT,
PROTECT IT.

36:45.507 --> 36:47.509
THIS HARVESTER GUY
HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.903
I'LL KEEP IT
ACROSS THE BAY,

36:49.903 --> 36:52.514
AWAY FROM YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY.

36:52.514 --> 36:53.950
THANK YOU.

37:00.392 --> 37:01.915
♪ WAKIN' UP FROM
MY WILDEST DREAMS... ♪

37:01.915 --> 37:03.221
THIS WAS A GREAT IDEA.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.526
WELL, YOU BROUGHT THE FOOD.

37:04.526 --> 37:06.615
HMM. IT'S NOT
ALL I BROUGHT.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.356
DUG UP A TRADEMARK
REQUEST FOR THE
CRIME ZERO INITIATIVE.

37:08.356 --> 37:10.228
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHO FILED IT.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.360
"DELTA SECURITY ENDEAVORS"?
HOW DID I NOT SEE THIS?

37:12.360 --> 37:14.057
IT'S ALL CONNECTED--

37:14.057 --> 37:16.582
CRIME WAVE,
ORDINANCE 11, THIS.

37:16.582 --> 37:17.974
NADIA, YOU--

37:20.977 --> 37:23.241
