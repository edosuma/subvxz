<i>Mac, you built a golf
course in a nature reserve?</i>

02:09.479 --> 02:11.494
<i>Our</i> nature reserve,
brother.

02:11.496 --> 02:13.831
While you were away
getting your fancy education,

02:13.833 --> 02:16.103
I was creating business
from our land.

02:16.105 --> 02:17.094
What happened
to all the wolves

02:17.096 --> 02:18.439
in this area?

02:18.441 --> 02:19.846
We built caves for them
up in the hills,

02:19.848 --> 02:21.511
<i>don't worry.</i>

02:21.513 --> 02:23.974
- <i>Fake caves?</i>
- <i>Yes, Ian.</i>

02:23.976 --> 02:26.118
<i>Some wolves are already
living in them.</i>

02:26.120 --> 02:28.646
Don't you remember what
great-grandfather warned of?

02:28.648 --> 02:31.302
Yes, yes, he said,
"Take care of your people."

02:31.304 --> 02:33.543
And now we'll get
new schools, a hospital...

02:33.545 --> 02:36.390
He also said,
"Never disturb nature.

02:36.392 --> 02:38.375
Or nature
will disturb you."

02:57.385 --> 02:59.495
You're digging up
sacred grounds too?

02:59.497 --> 03:01.094
Spirits are buried here!

03:02.185 --> 03:04.103
No, the so-called,
"spirits"

03:04.105 --> 03:05.926
are actually
dinosaur skeletons.

03:05.928 --> 03:08.359
<i>Dinosaur skeletons?</i>

03:08.361 --> 03:10.438
And I found a museum
who's willing to pay

03:10.440 --> 03:13.830
tens of millions of dollars
for these bones.

03:13.832 --> 03:15.401
We'll be very rich.

03:33.736 --> 03:36.261
Oh, no.

03:36.263 --> 03:38.503
<i>Oh, oh,
this is bad.</i>

03:38.505 --> 03:40.198
<i>What do I do?</i>

03:40.200 --> 03:42.438
<i>Okay, I gotta stop this.</i>

03:42.440 --> 03:43.623
Oh, crickets.

03:57.032 --> 03:59.623
<i>So, you two
decided to take the plunge</i>

03:59.625 --> 04:01.702
<i>and move
to Wolf-burbia?</i>

04:01.704 --> 04:03.271
<i>Well, we're considering it.</i>

04:03.273 --> 04:05.543
<i>Some wolves
love the idea.</i>

04:05.545 --> 04:07.206
<i>Others don't.</i>

04:07.208 --> 04:09.062
- <i>Humphrey...</i>
- <i>Kate...</i>

04:09.064 --> 04:11.142
Well, I hear
it's very safe here.

04:11.144 --> 04:13.830
We have a problem with
rogue wolves in our area.

04:13.832 --> 04:15.302
And with three pups
who have a tendency

04:15.304 --> 04:17.831
to get into preteen trouble.

04:17.833 --> 04:20.870
Well,
no rogue wolves here.

04:20.872 --> 04:23.590
Your pups
will be very safe.

04:23.592 --> 04:25.766
And here we go.

04:25.768 --> 04:27.302
Isn't it perfect?

04:27.304 --> 04:30.213
Oh... Yes!

04:30.215 --> 04:33.543
Too perfect.

04:36.936 --> 04:38.982
Uh, I knew it, Kate!

04:38.984 --> 04:40.966
This cave is made
of plastic?

04:40.968 --> 04:43.142
It's actually
recycled material.

04:43.144 --> 04:46.022
The unnatural
is the new natural.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.806
"The unnatural
is the new natural?"

04:48.808 --> 04:50.310
That sounds like
when my Uncle Tony

04:50.312 --> 04:52.519
came home
with a fur toupee.

04:52.521 --> 04:53.574
<i>Fore!</i>

04:53.576 --> 04:55.366
Oh! And look
at that view.

04:55.368 --> 04:59.910
<i>Oh, what a location,
location, location.</i>

04:59.912 --> 05:03.173
Why don't you
look inside?

05:03.175 --> 05:05.190
It's very high-tech.

05:05.192 --> 05:08.070
You know
the preteens and tech.

05:08.072 --> 05:10.502
Preteens wolf pups
and tech?

05:10.504 --> 05:12.616
<i>Come on, Humphrey.</i>

05:15.272 --> 05:18.117
<i>Wait a minute, did
lights just come on automatically?</i>

05:18.119 --> 05:20.518
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- Greetings.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.929
What?

05:22.983 --> 05:24.358
Birds. Out of here now.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.149
Shoo!

05:26.151 --> 05:28.134
Shoo, I have a sale
in progress.

05:28.136 --> 05:30.214
We are aware
of that, madam.

05:30.216 --> 05:32.358
That is why we're here.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.542
No, you are here

05:33.544 --> 05:35.749
to leave bird droppings
on my sidewalks.

05:37.383 --> 05:39.654
Bird droppings
on your sidewalk?

05:39.656 --> 05:41.639
How about a bird dropping
in your eye!

05:41.641 --> 05:43.562
And I just ate
a lot of fiber.

05:48.808 --> 05:52.230
You evil birds.

05:52.232 --> 05:54.086
Well done, Paddy.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.103
We English
are very precise.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.638
What's going on?

05:57.640 --> 06:00.358
Your real estate lady
wouldn't let us land.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.789
Oh, Carney
these are our friends.

06:02.791 --> 06:05.447
They're the godparents
of our three pups.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.629
They're here to give us

06:06.631 --> 06:09.253
an unbiased, uncoached,
second opinion

06:09.255 --> 06:12.934
of this hideous,
unlivable, plastic cave.

06:12.936 --> 06:14.886
Oh, well,

06:14.888 --> 06:17.734
I actually love birds.

06:17.736 --> 06:22.405
- So...
- Right back at you.

06:22.407 --> 06:24.296
<i>So, Marcel and
Paddy, what do you think?</i>

06:30.952 --> 06:33.574
It's very safe here,
no rogue wolves.

06:33.576 --> 06:35.402
Well, safety
is very important.

06:38.633 --> 06:40.742
Peck, peck.
Who's there?

06:40.744 --> 06:42.886
Oh, they don't
build them like they...

06:42.888 --> 06:45.671
Wait a minute.
Caves aren't built at all.

06:45.673 --> 06:48.490
They're just
naturally formed, madam.

06:54.535 --> 06:57.318
But you know,
it's not half bad here.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.365
Eighteen holes.
PGA designed.

06:59.367 --> 07:01.765
In fact,
I love it here.

07:01.767 --> 07:03.942
Voilà!
There you have it.

07:03.944 --> 07:05.797
Oh, I... I see.

07:05.799 --> 07:07.014
Yes, very nice.

07:07.016 --> 07:10.790
I... I concur.
Very nice green-ery.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.230
Okay, Humphrey.

07:12.232 --> 07:15.623
You now have our second
and third opinion.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.478
Do it for the pups.

07:17.480 --> 07:21.126
Ugh. I guess we're moving
to Wolf-burbia.

07:21.128 --> 07:22.313
Oh!

07:33.960 --> 07:35.462
That feels better.

07:35.464 --> 07:36.902
<i>Humphrey?</i>

07:36.904 --> 07:38.342
<i>You know, I think moving
the pups are night</i>

07:38.344 --> 07:40.039
<i>was a great idea.</i>

07:40.041 --> 07:42.181
<i>The shock would've been
too much for them.</i>

07:42.183 --> 07:44.389
And carrying our three
"Sleeping Beauties"

07:44.391 --> 07:46.439
was quite the shock
to my back.

07:46.441 --> 07:49.065
<i>Can you wake them up,
breakfast is almost ready.</i>

07:53.576 --> 07:57.094
Okay, where does
that light come from?

07:57.096 --> 08:01.254
Breakfast is ready
and I see we're...

08:01.256 --> 08:03.109
Humphrey!
They're not up?

08:03.111 --> 08:04.261
Sorry, Kate.

08:04.263 --> 08:06.021
My omega alarm clock
didn't work.

08:06.023 --> 08:09.061
Maybe your alpha one will?

08:10.024 --> 08:11.303
Where's the hunt?

08:11.305 --> 08:12.326
Caribou.

08:12.328 --> 08:15.751
I have to pee.

08:15.753 --> 08:18.053
Okay, pups.
First day in your new home.

08:18.055 --> 08:20.552
Look around.
Aren't you excited?

08:24.455 --> 08:28.101
I'm glad you carried us in
while we were sleeping.

08:28.103 --> 08:29.510
Why's that, Stinky?

08:29.512 --> 08:32.070
'Cause I would've
run away.

08:32.072 --> 08:33.383
Mom, Dad,

08:33.385 --> 08:35.780
this cave is like
a total poseur.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.126
What is this stuff?

08:37.129 --> 08:40.837
Oh, honey, it's called
recycled material.

08:40.840 --> 08:44.134
Recycled?
As in plastic bottles?

08:44.135 --> 08:47.397
I think I taste cola.

08:47.399 --> 08:50.534
Your father and I
are completely aligned

08:50.536 --> 08:54.054
that moving here is
a great idea for our family.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.936
Okay, let's tour
the new neighborhood.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.062
Dad, now that we moved
to the 'burbs,

09:09.064 --> 09:11.943
why does mom have
a constant smile on her face?

09:11.945 --> 09:13.285
I don't know, son.

09:13.287 --> 09:15.558
To balance out
my constant scowl?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.318
So, I don't get it,

09:17.320 --> 09:19.494
why are we living
in this area?

09:19.496 --> 09:21.510
Well, it's
a very safe environment.

09:21.512 --> 09:24.134
<i>Fore!</i>

09:24.136 --> 09:26.213
Heads-up!

09:30.855 --> 09:32.454
You were saying, Kate?

09:32.456 --> 09:34.375
Runt was once
kidnapped by rogues

09:34.377 --> 09:36.229
and we're a family
that's a bit prone

09:36.231 --> 09:39.206
to getting into...
situations.

09:39.208 --> 09:42.407
I'd take golf balls
over rogue wolves any day.

09:42.409 --> 09:45.158
But that's what being
a wild animal's all about,

09:45.160 --> 09:47.270
surviving the wild.

09:47.272 --> 09:49.352
Look! A lake.

09:54.793 --> 09:57.864
- I smell chlorine.
- Wait a minute.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.733
The lake is fake.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.389
Wait, are you sure?

10:18.663 --> 10:20.934
This place is very off.

10:20.936 --> 10:22.472
<i>Fore!</i>

10:23.847 --> 10:26.438
My point exactly.

10:28.424 --> 10:30.566
Well done, Marcel.

10:30.568 --> 10:34.438
Hello, wolves.
Did you just see my shot?

10:34.440 --> 10:38.309
We did.
Good job, Marcel.

10:38.311 --> 10:40.230
Pups, welcome
to your new neighborhood.

10:40.232 --> 10:41.481
How do you like it
so far?

10:44.072 --> 10:46.022
Adjusting, huh?
Oh.

10:46.024 --> 10:48.613
Well, Kate and Humphrey,
now that you're living here

10:48.615 --> 10:52.166
I insist on giving you
golf lessons.

10:52.168 --> 10:53.477
Maybe the whole family
can learn.

10:53.479 --> 10:57.510
A fun activity.
Together.

10:57.512 --> 11:00.229
Well, Paddy.
Shall we play on?

11:00.231 --> 11:02.088
Yes, back to the green.

11:09.607 --> 11:12.229
Hey, Mom, Dad,
see that forest over there?

11:12.231 --> 11:16.774
- Yes?
- We're going to hang out there.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.629
You wanna
stay with us, Runt?

11:18.631 --> 11:19.975
Nope, I have to pee

11:19.977 --> 11:21.865
and I don't wanna worry
about carpeting.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.782
Now this is more like it.

11:31.784 --> 11:34.374
I can't believe they moved
from our awesome wild home

11:34.376 --> 11:35.653
<i>to a bland community.</i>

11:35.655 --> 11:37.349
<i>I mean, we're wolves.</i>

11:37.351 --> 11:39.333
Seriously.
And did you hear Mom say

11:39.335 --> 11:41.605
that we're always
getting into trouble?

11:41.607 --> 11:44.518
As if we walk right
into situations.

11:45.896 --> 11:47.973
I smell something strange.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.086
Something really different.

11:50.088 --> 11:52.169
And your smell
is never wrong.

12:02.856 --> 12:06.245
Whoa. Claudette, Runt.
Come here, quick.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.327
Are those eyes?

12:10.183 --> 12:12.073
Let me do
my tree hugger thing.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.734
Hey there,
are you okay?

12:17.736 --> 12:18.854
I'm Runt.

12:18.856 --> 12:20.422
And below is my sister,
Claudette.

12:20.424 --> 12:21.606
And my brother, Stinky.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.917
We just moved
to the neighborhood.

12:22.919 --> 12:25.286
Are you in trouble?
Do you need help?

12:25.288 --> 12:27.494
Is it a reptile
up in a tree?

12:27.496 --> 12:29.094
I can't tell!

12:29.096 --> 12:31.174
Hey, it's kinda nice
seeing another creature.

12:31.176 --> 12:32.453
We just moved here

12:32.455 --> 12:34.310
and wanted to make friends
with the locals.

12:34.312 --> 12:36.745
We're very accepting
of all critters.

12:44.552 --> 12:46.409
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

12:51.205 --> 12:52.742
Wow, new
home, new problem.

12:52.744 --> 12:54.085
Wait!

12:54.087 --> 12:55.621
<i>You're telling me.</i>

12:55.623 --> 12:57.958
<i>Does anyone
know what that is?</i>

12:57.960 --> 12:59.974
Wait! Wait!

12:59.976 --> 13:02.182
Oh, crickets.
Dear, goodness.

13:02.184 --> 13:03.942
This is what
we evolved to?

13:03.944 --> 13:05.606
Miniature dogs?

13:05.608 --> 13:07.718
I didn't mean
to scare you!

13:07.720 --> 13:09.833
You said you liked
being helpful!

13:36.231 --> 13:38.565
Let's give this
a dust up.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.733
Oh!

13:41.735 --> 13:44.998
Now, let's all
do the spin out.

13:47.463 --> 13:49.990
Oh, crickets.

13:50.984 --> 13:52.550
Watch out for my tail!

13:52.552 --> 13:53.798
<i>Look out!</i>

14:02.375 --> 14:04.294
Wow, well, we
all wanted the wild,

14:04.296 --> 14:05.958
and that tops it.

14:07.208 --> 14:09.097
Maybe we should've gone
golfing after all.

14:10.407 --> 14:13.000
Now, get your legs
in an even stance.

14:15.335 --> 14:17.669
This is my even stance.

14:17.671 --> 14:20.102
Humphrey,
weight on your heels.

14:20.104 --> 14:21.925
It looks like you're going
to lay a turd.

14:21.927 --> 14:24.357
Hello,
I'm a four-legged creature.

14:24.359 --> 14:25.798
This isn't
natural for me.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.229
Humphrey,
listen to Marcel.

14:28.231 --> 14:30.919
And keep your head
down when you follow through.

14:34.215 --> 14:36.869
<i>Ladies?</i>

14:36.871 --> 14:39.653
<i>Can you please move?
You're in my shot.</i>

14:41.095 --> 14:43.974
I can't golf
with the two moons

14:43.976 --> 14:45.702
in my eyeline.

14:45.704 --> 14:48.169
Where's a dog cone
when you need one?

14:51.719 --> 14:53.445
<i>Focus on the ball.</i>

14:53.447 --> 14:55.493
Focus on the ball.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.872
Wha...

15:00.903 --> 15:03.173
<i>Fore!</i>

15:10.984 --> 15:13.638
- That's it.
- I'm tired of that hacker.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.782
Sorry! My bad.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.350
Easy, ladies.

15:17.352 --> 15:20.261
I think I'll take flight.

15:20.263 --> 15:22.118
Marcel, what do I do?

15:22.120 --> 15:25.705
Humphrey, think of this
as a teachable moment.

15:30.728 --> 15:32.777
Kate,
a little help here!

15:40.455 --> 15:41.958
Paddy, I think
it's time we did

15:41.960 --> 15:43.462
a quick migration
to the lake.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.381
Righty, ho!

15:45.383 --> 15:48.101
Come on, ladies.
It was an accident.

15:48.103 --> 15:50.149
<i>Talk to the antlers.</i>

15:50.151 --> 15:52.134
Hey!

15:59.846 --> 16:03.141
Humphrey is just
not suited for golf.

16:03.143 --> 16:05.189
Did you see how bad
that swing was?

16:05.191 --> 16:06.471
I heard that!

16:15.144 --> 16:16.965
Humphrey, are you okay?

16:16.967 --> 16:19.784
I told you I'd make it
on to the green.

16:22.376 --> 16:24.550
Okay, let's start
from the top.

16:24.552 --> 16:25.862
My name is Amy.

16:25.864 --> 16:27.332
And I'm a dinosaur.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.677
Hi, Amy.

16:28.679 --> 16:30.501
I was living
below the area

16:30.503 --> 16:32.069
where you're now sitting.

16:32.071 --> 16:34.309
There is someone
who dug up this hole

16:34.311 --> 16:36.453
and is trying
to sell me and Rex.

16:36.455 --> 16:38.693
But a very bad idea.

16:38.695 --> 16:39.655
Rex?

16:40.711 --> 16:44.774
A T-Rex.
Way down below.

16:44.776 --> 16:46.342
What is that?

16:46.344 --> 16:48.390
I'm a little behind
in my dinosaur knowledge.

16:48.392 --> 16:50.758
And I need
a bit more backstory, Amy.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.678
Backstory? Okay.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.565
Back... Backstory.

16:54.567 --> 16:57.926
65 million years ago,

16:57.928 --> 16:59.206
<i>my mom used to tell me,</i>

16:59.208 --> 17:01.093
<i>if I was in trouble
with predators,</i>

17:01.095 --> 17:03.302
<i>I was to run
to the sacred space.</i>

17:03.304 --> 17:05.478
<i>And look
for a circle of light.</i>

17:05.480 --> 17:08.390
<i>It was area
of protection.</i>

17:42.183 --> 17:45.030
<i>Something strange
was happening.</i>

17:48.424 --> 17:53.989
<i>So, we sort of survived.
Like my mom said we would.</i>

17:53.991 --> 17:56.549
But if they dig down
to the Rex,

17:56.551 --> 17:58.917
his spirit
will also emerge.

17:58.919 --> 18:00.613
He's huge and ruthless

18:00.615 --> 18:02.821
and will destroy everything
in his path.

18:02.823 --> 18:04.549
<i>They need
to leave this area alone</i>

18:04.551 --> 18:08.132
<i>or they will be
very sorry.</i>

18:08.134 --> 18:10.373
Oh, crickets.
I hope I didn't scare you.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.901
Not at all.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.021
Okay, they're back from lunch.
The diggers.

18:22.023 --> 18:23.622
- I gotta hide.
- Wait.

18:23.624 --> 18:24.743
We'll come too.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.950
Griffin, leave the keys
in the car.

18:30.952 --> 18:33.349
I'm not in the mood for you
losing our keys again.

18:33.351 --> 18:35.302
All right, Jethro.
I'll leave 'em inside.

18:35.304 --> 18:36.741
Ain't no one
around here anyways,

18:36.743 --> 18:37.960
except for us.

18:40.647 --> 18:42.501
Oh, no.
It's the wolf trappers.

18:42.503 --> 18:44.358
- Remember them?
- Yeah.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.021
And now they're diggers?

18:46.023 --> 18:47.589
You know them?

18:47.591 --> 18:50.629
They tried to capture us
but we outsmarted them.

18:50.631 --> 18:51.782
Mm-hmm.

18:51.784 --> 18:53.317
Basically, we kicked
their butt.

18:53.319 --> 18:54.344
Yeah, we did.

19:02.727 --> 19:03.941
No way, huh-uh.

19:03.943 --> 19:04.998
Okay.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.117
No way!

19:06.119 --> 19:07.974
Okay, Amy.
We've discussed it.

19:07.976 --> 19:09.702
We're gonna help you
stop them from digging

19:09.704 --> 19:10.918
up that hole.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.446
Thanks.
It's my home too.

19:13.448 --> 19:16.196
I can only go back
when the light shines upon it.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.574
And I need to go home.

19:17.576 --> 19:20.005
It's the only place
I can survive.

19:20.007 --> 19:21.383
How are you
gonna stop them?

19:25.128 --> 19:27.685
Whew, wow.
It's hot.

19:27.687 --> 19:29.061
Dang hot.

19:29.063 --> 19:31.044
Now this here's
a sacred burial ground.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.389
I sure hope there isn't

19:32.391 --> 19:34.533
some human skeleton
we run into.

19:34.535 --> 19:36.582
'Cause I would
lose my lunch.

19:36.584 --> 19:38.597
I paid $5 for that burrito.

19:38.599 --> 19:40.197
And we lost
a lot of money

19:40.199 --> 19:41.413
when we didn't
catch them wolves.

19:43.239 --> 19:47.012
You hear that?
Is that our truck?

19:53.928 --> 19:55.557
Sis, you got this?

19:55.559 --> 19:57.636
Yeah, don't try this
at home, right?

19:57.638 --> 20:00.293
Hey, wait!
That's our truck!

20:00.295 --> 20:02.276
Okay, wolf trappers
are in sight.

20:02.278 --> 20:03.365
They're getting close.

20:03.367 --> 20:04.264
Step on it, Stinky!

20:07.144 --> 20:08.391
Come back here!

20:11.208 --> 20:13.256
Hey! That is our truck!

20:16.230 --> 20:18.503
It's that
wolf pup again.

20:22.376 --> 20:25.607
Wow, those wolves
are something else.

20:32.423 --> 20:34.789
Humphrey,
sorry about the issue

20:34.791 --> 20:36.036
with the antlers.

20:37.768 --> 20:38.885
Oh, too soon?

20:38.887 --> 20:42.597
Not soon enough.
I want outta here.

20:42.599 --> 20:44.902
Humphrey, you're just
adjusting to this new place.

20:44.904 --> 20:46.309
Look at us.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.718
We love it here.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.798
Ah, it's like
that lake in Vegas.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.589
The one
with the fountains.

20:57.159 --> 20:59.428
What is that?
Do you hear music?

20:59.430 --> 21:01.284
I do, indeed.

21:01.286 --> 21:04.041
It's doing something to me.

21:14.278 --> 21:16.709
It's... sweeping me.

21:16.711 --> 21:18.372
Me too.

21:18.374 --> 21:19.976
Literally.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.760
You guys okay there?

22:41.126 --> 22:43.813
Humphrey, Kate,
pretend you didn't see that.

22:44.904 --> 22:47.974
Hopefully
no one else saw...

22:59.975 --> 23:01.413
There it is.

23:01.415 --> 23:04.165
Looks like someone just wanted
a joyride or something.

23:04.167 --> 23:07.556
I swear I saw
that wolf pup inside.

23:07.558 --> 23:09.796
Or maybe we're just
seeing things, brother.

23:09.798 --> 23:12.263
Hey, that looks like
the boss's truck.

23:15.431 --> 23:17.541
What are you two doing here?
Why aren't you digging?

23:17.543 --> 23:19.236
We were.

23:19.238 --> 23:22.052
But someone stole our truck
and we just found it here.

23:22.054 --> 23:23.461
We think some wolves
jumped in

23:23.463 --> 23:24.965
and drove it away.

23:24.967 --> 23:26.853
What? That is ridiculous.

23:26.855 --> 23:28.293
Are you joking with me?

23:28.295 --> 23:30.501
We lost a whole day
of digging.

23:30.503 --> 23:32.358
The museum is coming
in two days

23:32.360 --> 23:35.845
- to inspect the bones.
- Now, don't get yourself all huffy.

23:35.847 --> 23:37.477
Mac, chill out.

23:37.479 --> 23:39.430
You get back
there first thing.

23:39.432 --> 23:40.548
I'm gonna have
to find more people

23:40.550 --> 23:42.341
to help you dig that hole.

24:01.255 --> 24:02.629
Oh, you made it back.

24:02.631 --> 24:05.124
Good job with getting rid
of those diggers.

24:05.126 --> 24:08.069
Well, it's only temporary.
They'll be back tomorrow.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.861
And there will be
more of them.

24:09.863 --> 24:12.709
So, we'll have to figure out
a way to stop them.

24:12.711 --> 24:14.248
We'll want to talk to our parents.

24:18.535 --> 24:20.772
Are you looking
for something?

24:20.774 --> 24:23.749
Oh...
It's such a silly notion.

24:23.751 --> 24:25.510
Oh, crickets.

24:25.512 --> 24:27.109
What is it?

24:27.111 --> 24:30.309
Well, I wanna see
what the world looks like now

24:30.311 --> 24:33.316
This may be
my one and only time.

24:33.318 --> 24:35.910
Then you'll see the world
as we see it.

24:35.912 --> 24:38.790
Come on,
we'll show you around.

24:38.792 --> 24:40.133
You want
to ride shotgun?

24:40.135 --> 24:41.064
I'm really fast.

24:44.904 --> 24:48.549
Okay, tell me where to go.

24:48.551 --> 24:50.663
We're going
to a real lake.

24:56.072 --> 24:57.189
What is that?

24:57.191 --> 24:58.149
It's a train.

24:58.151 --> 24:59.941
Look for the open car.

24:59.943 --> 25:01.253
So, when we say, "jump."

25:01.255 --> 25:04.132
Okay?

25:04.134 --> 25:05.893
It looks fun.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.336
<i>Jump!</i>

25:28.872 --> 25:30.564
Sure was fun.

25:30.566 --> 25:31.716
Way to go, bro-bro.

25:31.718 --> 25:32.932
Yeah.

25:32.934 --> 25:34.277
I think she's
really enjoying it.

25:34.279 --> 25:36.837
Who's enjoying what?

25:36.839 --> 25:38.757
Where are your parents?

25:38.759 --> 25:41.125
- Close by.
- Hey, Rogue Wolf!

25:41.127 --> 25:43.204
Why don't you go back
to the eastern hills?

25:43.206 --> 25:46.053
Did you know pups
are one of our favorite foods?

25:52.519 --> 25:55.494
Oh, really?
We're <i>so</i> scared.

25:55.496 --> 25:57.733
Don't under estimate
these pups.

25:57.735 --> 25:59.620
I've heard
they are very tricky.

26:34.247 --> 26:35.781
Amy, where are you going?

26:35.783 --> 26:36.870
I don't know.

26:36.872 --> 26:38.373
I'm drawn
to that fountain.

26:48.199 --> 26:50.471
Look, the birds,
they're dancing.

27:15.238 --> 27:18.213
If just keep my
eyes above the golf course,

27:18.215 --> 27:20.132
it's actually
a really nice view.

27:20.134 --> 27:21.477
Look down there.

27:21.479 --> 27:23.781
- What is that?
- I think it's the pups...

27:23.783 --> 27:25.800
goodness,
what did they find?

27:28.199 --> 27:30.564
That was an amazing day.

27:30.566 --> 27:31.908
Thanks so much.

27:31.910 --> 27:33.797
Tomorrow
is gonna be rough.

27:33.799 --> 27:36.199
But I'm glad
today was great.

27:48.135 --> 27:49.348
Hi, Mom and Dad.

27:49.350 --> 27:50.789
We have a situation.

27:50.791 --> 27:52.517
You know how you always
encouraged us

27:52.519 --> 27:54.500
to mix it up
with other critters?

27:54.502 --> 27:57.351
And I never heard you
exclude dinosaurs.

27:59.783 --> 28:01.288
Oh, crickets.

28:04.487 --> 28:07.077
I think everyone over there
is in shock.

28:07.079 --> 28:08.996
Seems like everyone is.

28:08.998 --> 28:10.821
Except the crickets.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.132
Maybe them too.

28:12.134 --> 28:14.085
Okay, on the count
of three,

28:14.087 --> 28:15.589
everyone bark.

28:15.591 --> 28:17.252
One... two...

28:17.254 --> 28:19.173
Three.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.349
Oh, gosh.
It's still there.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.397
Pups, what have you found?

28:23.399 --> 28:24.773
Let us explain.

28:24.775 --> 28:26.341
Can we move this
to the cave?

28:26.343 --> 28:28.583
It's cool,
this is our friend, Amy.

28:32.231 --> 28:33.542
Okay, okay.

28:33.544 --> 28:36.228
Let's just say
everything tonight is true.

28:36.230 --> 28:37.765
Let me organize
my thoughts.

28:37.767 --> 28:39.045
According to Amy,
the dinosaur,

28:39.047 --> 28:40.196
we have to stop
the digging

28:40.198 --> 28:41.925
or there will be
a giant T-Rex unleashed.

28:41.927 --> 28:43.172
But we need to do this
in time for Amy

28:43.174 --> 28:45.348
to go back
to the sacred burial ground

28:45.350 --> 28:46.885
but it has to be timed
with a ray of light,

28:46.887 --> 28:49.220
so she can return back
to her former existence.

28:49.222 --> 28:50.565
Did I miss anything?

28:50.567 --> 28:51.781
You got it, Dad.

28:51.783 --> 28:53.988
Everything else
in this park is fake,

28:53.990 --> 28:57.221
why did a dinosaur
have to be real?

28:57.223 --> 29:00.775
Dad, Mom, may I offer
some parenting tips?

29:03.303 --> 29:05.508
You raised us
to be kind, caring,

29:05.510 --> 29:07.876
and always wanting
to help someone in need.

29:07.878 --> 29:11.813
And that is why we often
get into situations.

29:11.815 --> 29:13.316
Well, we're in one now,

29:13.318 --> 29:15.400
and Amy's
also our friend.

29:18.215 --> 29:22.213
Thanks for reminding us
what this family stands for.

29:22.215 --> 29:25.669
Come on, give it up.

29:25.671 --> 29:27.717
Hey, you guys
over there.

29:27.719 --> 29:30.053
These wolves are huggers

29:30.055 --> 29:32.069
and we birds
are not huggers.

29:33.703 --> 29:36.520
- Amy, you too.
- Come on, Amy.

30:19.078 --> 30:20.805
There are a lot
of human workers,

30:20.807 --> 30:22.277
and they have guns.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.780
And there's
no way to stop them

30:23.782 --> 30:25.575
without someone
getting injured.

30:34.087 --> 30:36.996
They are not
going to beat us.

30:36.998 --> 30:38.887
Nice to have
the old mom back.

30:53.990 --> 30:56.197
You see, brother.

30:56.199 --> 30:58.084
No problems with nature.

30:58.086 --> 30:59.844
The day is young, Mac.

30:59.846 --> 31:02.053
Ian, it's like you want
something bad to happen.

31:02.055 --> 31:03.172
Don't you know
how rich we'll become,

31:03.174 --> 31:04.548
you and I?

31:04.550 --> 31:06.116
So much for taking care
of the people.

31:12.743 --> 31:14.309
Well,
don't just stand there,

31:14.311 --> 31:18.020
Griffin, Jethro,
protect this site.

31:27.078 --> 31:30.692
It's like we're surrounded
by dang wolves.

31:30.694 --> 31:32.388
I don't like this.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.436
We're gonna be attacked
by wolves.

31:34.438 --> 31:35.460
Don't worry.

31:35.462 --> 31:38.596
It's just sounds
from nature.

31:38.598 --> 31:39.684
I am worried.

31:39.686 --> 31:41.380
It sounds like
a lot of them.

31:41.382 --> 31:43.589
This must be
their territory.

31:43.591 --> 31:45.060
Keep digging.

31:45.062 --> 31:46.501
<i>We have security here.</i>

31:46.503 --> 31:50.148
<i>Oh, they are
really reassuring.</i>

31:50.150 --> 31:51.749
I'm not gonna let
my men get attacked.

31:51.751 --> 31:53.896
Come on, guys.
Let's wait in our trucks.

31:57.671 --> 31:58.823
Whoa!

32:11.783 --> 32:14.180
- What is going on?
- It's nature fighting back.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.527
Oh, Ian,
give it a rest.

32:23.910 --> 32:25.637
They're blocking
my ground.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.135
No, it's their ground.

32:34.790 --> 32:38.086
- Okay, so far, so good.
- It's not over yet.

32:56.486 --> 32:58.756
- You pay us double?
- Yes.

32:58.758 --> 32:59.974
Dig! Dig!

33:04.806 --> 33:06.437
<i>Stop, stop, stop.</i>

33:06.439 --> 33:07.908
There's something here.

33:07.910 --> 33:10.597
Okay, switch to shovels,
and be careful.

33:10.599 --> 33:12.741
The museum needs
these bones undamaged.

33:12.743 --> 33:15.300
I think they're about to get
what they want.

33:15.302 --> 33:18.149
But not like they wanted.

33:33.095 --> 33:35.364
What the heck is that?

33:35.366 --> 33:37.223
Oh, gosh, here it come.
Crickets!

33:54.183 --> 33:55.397
What the...

33:55.399 --> 33:57.508
Is that a live dinosaur?

33:57.510 --> 33:59.492
How the heck
did that happen?

33:59.494 --> 34:00.647
Run!

34:07.879 --> 34:11.493
Well, maybe having
a T-Rex is not all bad.

34:11.495 --> 34:13.027
Run for your life!

34:52.101 --> 34:54.085
Huh?

35:31.079 --> 35:34.020
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Crickets. This is it.

35:34.022 --> 35:35.461
Mom, Dad,

35:35.463 --> 35:36.644
we've got to get him
back to the site,

35:36.646 --> 35:38.628
in time
for the ray of light.

35:38.630 --> 35:41.444
<i>We've gotta buy some
time until the clouds clear.</i>

35:41.446 --> 35:46.948
But the more time we buy,
the more Rex destroys.

35:46.950 --> 35:49.317
Oh, no.
He's at our cave.

36:01.607 --> 36:04.228
Oh, darn.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.076
Yeah... darn...

36:07.078 --> 36:09.064
Too bad.

36:14.310 --> 36:16.644
No!

36:16.646 --> 36:19.811
I have an idea.
It's sort of dangerous.

36:19.813 --> 36:21.861
Everything right now
is sort of dangerous.

36:21.863 --> 36:23.269
Runt, blurt it out.

36:23.271 --> 36:25.605
Amy, birds are
your descendents, right?

36:25.607 --> 36:28.069
Yes, but I can't
fly out of here.

36:28.071 --> 36:30.308
And is T-Rex
from the bird family too?

36:30.310 --> 36:31.877
Yes...

36:31.879 --> 36:34.116
That Rex is not my brother.

36:34.118 --> 36:37.381
We just have to get him
close to the fountain...

36:37.383 --> 36:40.005
I see.
And the music will hold him.

36:40.007 --> 36:42.116
Yes! Long enough
for the ray of light

36:42.118 --> 36:43.107
to hit that spot.

36:43.109 --> 36:44.484
But how do we know

36:44.486 --> 36:45.988
when the music
will come on again?

36:45.990 --> 36:48.645
I'll just have him
chase me till it does.

36:48.647 --> 36:51.687
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

36:56.071 --> 36:57.415
Paddy, we have
to help her.

36:59.781 --> 37:01.860
Hey, brother.
You know what they say...

37:01.862 --> 37:04.614
birds of a feather...

37:06.726 --> 37:07.880
We gotta help.

37:16.487 --> 37:17.572
Hey, Pups.

37:17.574 --> 37:19.876
Do that thing
with the dust.

37:26.119 --> 37:29.700
Okay, head to the fountain.

The light has come through.

38:17.575 --> 38:19.172
Amy! The light!

38:19.174 --> 38:22.596
I can't stop dancing.

38:22.598 --> 38:25.444
I see it.
But I got the music in me.

38:25.446 --> 38:28.420
<i>♪ Oh, baby
oh, baby... ♪</i>

38:41.030 --> 38:42.981
Why can't you
just stay with us, Amy?

38:42.983 --> 38:44.452
Because, Runt,

38:44.454 --> 38:46.468
if I don't go back
to the sacred ground,

38:46.470 --> 38:48.932
my spirit will
eventually perish.

38:48.934 --> 38:52.389
That is the only place
where I can live on.

38:52.391 --> 38:56.131
I guess, we should
start saying our good-byes then.

38:56.133 --> 39:00.323
Yes, good-bye will occur
in some form today for sure.

39:02.791 --> 39:03.944
<i>Faster, Amy!</i>

39:05.927 --> 39:07.845
Amy, remember the spin out?

39:07.847 --> 39:09.444
Where my tail hit you?

39:09.446 --> 39:11.268
Yes. Okay,
when I say now,

39:11.270 --> 39:12.355
spin out.

39:12.357 --> 39:14.694
Oh, crickets.
I'll try.

39:16.070 --> 39:17.059
<i>Now!</i>

39:17.061 --> 39:18.182
Oh!

39:32.391 --> 39:34.692
Amy, hurry!

39:34.694 --> 39:37.255
Okay, I'm ready
to go back.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.100
<i>Stinky,
Claudette, and Runt,</i>

39:48.102 --> 39:50.341
<i>thank you
for your kindness.</i>

39:50.343 --> 39:53.635
You showed me a world
I had only dreamt of seeing.

39:53.637 --> 39:56.003
You have
a wonderful family.

39:56.005 --> 39:58.660
- Good-bye, Amy.
- We'll miss you, Amy.

39:58.662 --> 40:01.348
We love you, Amy...
forever.

40:01.350 --> 40:03.046
<i>We'll come here often.</i>

40:19.398 --> 40:20.709
<i>Are they gone?</i>

40:20.711 --> 40:22.532
In here?

40:22.534 --> 40:24.485
Will you help us
fill in the ground

40:24.487 --> 40:28.133
with those
humongous antlers.

40:28.135 --> 40:29.319
Gladly.

40:45.702 --> 40:48.580
Someone is helping us
fill in the ground.

40:48.582 --> 40:50.627
Perhaps it's nature.

40:50.629 --> 40:52.196
Okay, guys.

40:52.198 --> 40:54.020
As if we've never disturbed
this area

40:54.022 --> 40:56.099
in the first place.

41:09.702 --> 41:12.871
Now, we will never disturb
nature again.

41:21.573 --> 41:23.012
Mom and Dad,

41:23.014 --> 41:25.091
I thought you said
it would be safer here.

41:25.093 --> 41:28.163
It was,
until it wasn't.

41:28.165 --> 41:29.603
No one back home

41:29.605 --> 41:31.494
will ever believe
what just happened.

41:33.414 --> 41:35.300
So, pups, your mom and I

41:35.302 --> 41:38.179
are completely aligned
on this,

41:38.181 --> 41:39.748
what do you say
we go home?

41:39.750 --> 41:43.075
Our real home.
Our natural home.

41:43.077 --> 41:44.995
Yeah! Awesome!

41:45.958 --> 41:47.301
But remember, Pups,

41:47.303 --> 41:48.772
when we get back there

41:48.774 --> 41:50.884
we'll have to watch out
for rogue wolves again.

41:50.886 --> 41:52.931
Mom, we
just took on a T-Rex.

41:52.933 --> 41:54.148
We can handle
rogue wolves.

41:54.150 --> 41:55.493
Yeah, Mom.

41:55.495 --> 41:57.572
Did you see how big
that T-Rex was?

41:57.574 --> 42:01.476
It was a pretty awesome <i>situation.</i>

42:01.478 --> 42:02.756
<i>You're right, pups.</i>

42:02.758 --> 42:04.615
<i>Let's get home.</i>
