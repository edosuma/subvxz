-DIANE: Communications notified me.

00:04.963 --> 00:07.298
Some of the details here match a homicide
I caught over in Brooklyn.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.301
Well, let's just wait before we go puttin'
this out as some serial killer.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.846
Lieutenant, if you don't mind,
my boss wanted me to run with this

00:12.971 --> 00:14.764
-along with you guys.
-We're gonna go to the bar,

00:14.848 --> 00:16.224

00:16.307 --> 00:18.685
Just so you know, the owner,
James Carlin, real pain in the ass.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.104
Now if both these women had
city bus transfers on 'em,

00:21.187 --> 00:23.356
would you turn the transit authority
upside down too?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.316
Do you know how many people
come to this hotel each day?

00:25.442 --> 00:28.695
He saw you and Kurt go in there,
a little while later, the fire started.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.489
-Kurt was there too.
-No, Kurt's mom saw him home at 10:30.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.867
-There's no way he could've been there.
-(CHUCKLES) Ah, she's lying.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.037

-Kurt's mom is behind all this?

12:05.516 --> 12:07.518
The son, Kurt,
is he through bein' stitched up?

12:07.601 --> 12:09.478
Yeah, to minutes ago.
A uniform cop's watching him.

12:09.603 --> 12:10.938
We're gonna head down there now.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.651
-Another missive.
-What is this? Junior high?

12:15.776 --> 12:17.862
-I think it's very sweet.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

12:18.738 --> 12:20.781
-Hanler's worth a closer look.
-DIANE: I'm on it.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.617
Uh, CSU got a lift
out of Ann Healy's apartment.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.411
It comes back to a Steven Debrees,

12:25.494 --> 12:27.663
-record for public urination.
-I'll get working on Hanler.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.125
ANDY: Where does Debrees live?

12:31.542 --> 12:36.046
In the same building. He's the super.
I mean, maybe it's nothing.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.924
-No, it's worth a conversation.
-ANDY: We'll head down there.

12:41.886 --> 12:45.014
-Connie, what are you doin'?
-Gettin' some coffee.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.685
This one just says, "Gramercy Park."

12:50.811 --> 12:52.354
Gettin' cuter every minute.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.402
(SIGHS) Diane,
I don't know what's goin' on,

12:58.486 --> 13:00.154
but it's startin' to be disruptive.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.114
I'm workin' the case.

13:02.740 --> 13:06.035
So is Rita, and you got
no right dismissing her.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.578
I'll apologize to her.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.706
CONNIE: How about you just tell me
what's going on?

13:10.831 --> 13:13.125
-It's got nothing to do with you.
-Yeah, it does,

13:13.250 --> 13:14.794
'cause it's gettin' between me and Andy.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.254
I'm sorry, Connie, really.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.638
(SIGHS) You're right.
There is something going on.

13:25.721 --> 13:30.351
But it's, uh, it's very difficult
to talk about, and very personal.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.187
If I talk about it, I'll lose it.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.649
-CONNIE: Well, I'm here if you need me.
-Thank you.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.320
(EXHALES)

13:58.587 --> 13:59.797
How you feeling, Kurt?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.550
-All right.
-What happened at the apartment?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.886
I was in my room,
and I heard my mom yelling.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.639
I came out to see what was up,
and the guy just shot her.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.516
-You fight him?
-KURT: I tried to,

14:10.641 --> 14:13.435
but he was much bigger than me,
and he smacked me with his gun,

14:13.519 --> 14:15.271
and I don't remember anything after that.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.439
-BALDWIN: What he look like?
-KURT: He had a mask.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.860
-Well, general size?
-He was a big guy, about as tall as you.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.946
Your sister made him shorter.
She didn't see him more than a second.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.657
How would you know that bein' knocked out?

14:27.408 --> 14:30.327
You've had a bad run lately, Kurt.
And we feel for you honestly,

14:30.411 --> 14:32.204
but, uh, there's some things here
that don't fly.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.289
Like pretty much everything.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.250
Well, maybe I didn't get as good of a look
of him as I thought I did.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.960
All right, we'll pass
a description of the perp.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.630
Let's talk about your home life,
and how things have been comin' to a boil.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.923
Everything's been fine.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.134
Did your mom ride you
pretty hard after being arrested?

14:45.342 --> 14:46.552
-No.
-BALDWIN: Was she smacking around

14:46.635 --> 14:48.387
-more than usual?
-No!

14:48.512 --> 14:51.891
Well, if she did, we could understand
how you'd lose control,

14:52.099 --> 14:53.976
and if you express it right,
a judge would too.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.603
It could keep you out of jail.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.522
And that would be adult jail.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.900
We found the gun you dumped.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.861
-Where did you get it?
-I didn't get a gun, and I didn't do it!

15:03.944 --> 15:06.196
Your street-urchin friend, Ray Spier,
you get it from him?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.490
-No!
-Well, he'll tell us if you did.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.827
-He's not as tough as you think.
-He didn't have anything to do with this!

15:12.119 --> 15:13.329
Then who?

15:14.538 --> 15:16.874
You're digging
yourself a deep hole here, Kurt.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.376
I didn't do it!

15:34.600 --> 15:37.895
-You the super, Debrees?
-STEVEN: Uh... Building manager.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.605
We got some questions for ya.
How about we take a ride

15:39.688 --> 15:41.649
-to the station house?
-I'm painting.

15:42.107 --> 15:45.569
Well, uh, we don't want the world knowin'
about your collar for dickie wavin'.

15:45.694 --> 15:49.698
What collar for "dickie waving"?
What the hell is dickie waving, anyway?

15:49.823 --> 15:52.242
What you got arrested for last June.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.161
I got arrested for pissin'
behind a dumpster.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.705
I'm not exactly hidin' in shame
because of it.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.959
-You knew the girl who got killed?
-STEVEN: Yeah, to say hello.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.002
-Decent tenant?
-A few complaints,

16:02.086 --> 16:05.255
-traffic through her place, lot of guys.
-Were you one of 'em?

16:05.506 --> 16:07.383
-No.
-How'd your prints get in her apartment?

16:07.758 --> 16:10.803
I snaked out her shower drain,
unstuck her windows.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.389
-Where were you this morning?
-Public library, I'm a volunteer.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.684
-Can anyone vouch for you?
-Celeste Villalobos, my supervisor.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.018
Can I get back to this?

16:18.435 --> 16:19.520
A girl's brutally murdered

16:19.603 --> 16:21.146
in your building,
but you're just all business?

16:21.605 --> 16:23.732
More like I'm doin' every other chore
I can think of

16:23.816 --> 16:25.567
before I have to clean up
the poor girl's blood.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.528
Young girl, pretty.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.280
You're sure you weren't one
of those guys in and out of her apartment?

16:30.406 --> 16:32.366
I might've been if I wasn't gay.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.372
-You ever go to The Time Bar?
-I don't go to breeder bars.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.625
All right, something comes to mind,
there could be some bucks in it for ya.

16:45.212 --> 16:48.048
Hey, today, you paint the left half,
tomorrow, the right half.

16:48.132 --> 16:51.635
That way people can use the steps.
Just so you know.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

17:16.243 --> 17:17.327
Ah, he made us.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.831
-Don't make me chase you, Ray.
-What?

17:21.123 --> 17:23.250
What? I'm just... I'm... swingin'.

17:24.168 --> 17:25.961
-What did I do?
-Quiet.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.212
RAY: What did I do?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.592
-What's goin' on? What is this?
-I said keep quiet.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.427
Now, sit down.

17:34.678 --> 17:38.182
You, uh, you hear
about Kurt Ackerman's mom, Ray?

17:38.265 --> 17:40.809
-She get eaten by a shark?
-No, she got shot this morning.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.936
-What do you know about it?
-Who shot her?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.522
BALDWIN: Hey, Ray, we're not talking
to you for swingin' too high.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.442
I didn't shoot anybody.
I was in detention all morning.

17:48.525 --> 17:50.027
-BALDWIN: You have anything to do with it?
-Hell no.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.155
Look, we know you encouraged Kurt
to get violent against his mom.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.282
I just told him he should show some balls.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.201
No, you told him it was time
to get rid of the problem.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.286
-It didn't mean shooting her.
-Then why'd you give him the gun?

17:59.369 --> 18:02.081
-Who said that?
-GREG: We're saying that, so cop to it,

18:02.206 --> 18:04.541
and maybe there's a chance
this will stay in juvenile court.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.086
-I didn't get Kurt a gun.
-BALDWIN: Then who did, Ray?

18:07.169 --> 18:09.922
'Cause you're Kurt's only punked-out,
street-thug friend.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.549
Maybe it was his dad's.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.427
Kurt told me his dad brought home
a rifle two days ago.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.096
-Brought it home for what?
-Ask him.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.473
Look, you understand pullin'
somethin' like this out of your ass

18:19.598 --> 18:21.391
is just gonna slow us down
and piss us off?

18:21.683 --> 18:26.105
-Ask Kurt. Ask his loser dad.
-All right, we will. Let's take a walk.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.155
TONY: Thank you very much.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.617

18:40.744 --> 18:42.955
-Steven Debrees?
-Yeah, half a twitch.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.582
He said he was volunteering
at the public library.

18:45.666 --> 18:49.169
A, uh, Celeste Villalobos can vouch.
He's still worth looking into.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.379
I'll check it out.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.590
Ron Hanler's got charges
at The Capsule Bar last week

18:53.715 --> 18:55.884
and at The Time Bar two nights ago.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.554
The night before we caught
our second DOA in the pattern.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.974
A friend of Ann Healy's said the breakup
with Ron Hanler was pretty ugly,

19:02.057 --> 19:04.476
and that he sent her
a threatening letter two days ago.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.561
Threatening to kill her?

19:05.644 --> 19:07.646
CONNIE: All the friend said
was that it freaked Healy out.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.566
I'll ask crime scene to look
for letters in Healy's apartment.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.776
Well, I did,
and they didn't find anything.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.320
All right, we'll talk to Ron Hanler again.

19:16.446 --> 19:20.159
"Gramercy Park Hotel, room 225,
noon. Be there."

19:20.659 --> 19:22.578
-A few minutes to noon.
-It'll wait.

19:24.580 --> 19:29.293
I, uh, I spoke to Diane,
and whatever she's going through, I...

19:30.502 --> 19:34.798
-I didn't mean to sound jealous.
-There's nothing to be jealous about.

-I know.

-Where's Ray Spier?
-Uh... We took him to his mom.

19:57.404 --> 20:01.033
He says that, uh, Howard Ackerman
brought home a rifle a few days ago.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.035
-For what?
-He didn't know, uh...

20:03.118 --> 20:05.621
We ran the rifle ESU.
Found outside the Ackerman apartment.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.165
Howard Ackerman bought it
in Connecticut a few days ago.

20:08.248 --> 20:11.043
Yeah, he called in. Said he wasn't gettin'
self-service in Hartford,

20:11.126 --> 20:12.753
but he was near the city
and he'll be in soon.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.922
Alright, he's got a lot to answer for.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.840
TONY: Yeah, bring up the fact
that he wasn't in Hartford

20:16.924 --> 20:18.258
for the last two days.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.844
His credit card was being used
in a motel in Jersey City.

I'm gonna go to the doctor,
if that's okay.

20:33.857 --> 20:37.819
-TONY: Fine. Then go home and rest up.
-No, I'll come back if I can.

20:43.033 --> 20:46.536
So, the first thing you oughta know
is lying to us is bad policy.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.497
(SIGHS) When did I lie?

20:48.622 --> 20:51.875
You said the last contact you had
with Ann Healy was two weeks ago.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.877
Now we hear you sent her
threatening letters!

20:53.961 --> 20:56.880
-What are you talkin' about?
-She got a letter from you two days ago.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.050
(LAUGHS) Oh, please!

21:00.592 --> 21:03.011
-I sent her a box of fish sticks.
-Why?

21:03.220 --> 21:06.348
'Cause she's a cold fish.
So I sent her fish sticks.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.726
-As a joke.
-And it's funny, really.

21:10.143 --> 21:14.773
(SIGHS) Look, last date we had,
I told her she needed to loosen up.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.484
-She walked out on me.
-The fish sticks were a little payback.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.486
She call you up laughing?

21:20.320 --> 21:21.571
-No.
-She call you at all?

21:21.697 --> 21:23.782
-No.
-When they don't respond to a joke,

21:23.865 --> 21:26.618
Ron, huh? What's next?
You stop by, press the point?

21:26.743 --> 21:29.955
I told you before
I never laid a hand on her.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.957
You're a regular
at The Capsule Bar, aren't you?

21:32.874 --> 21:35.127
-I've been there twice.
-You go there last night?

-No!
-You didn't run into Ann Healy there,

21:37.754 --> 21:40.257
and maybe ask her how funny
she thought your little joke was?

21:40.424 --> 21:41.466
No, I did not.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.677
Don't make us prove you were there
and prove that you killed her

21:43.927 --> 21:46.305
when you can come out with it now,
and save years of your life.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.973
Stop it! Just stop it!

You're wrong! This is wrong!

No, you're hammerin' at me, though,
and it's startin' to freak me out.

-But she's a very tough customer.
-(SIGHS)

23:32.202 --> 23:38.083
You may have to cuff her to the bedpost
so she knows you mean business.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.169
Babe, I can't do this right now.

23:41.336 --> 23:44.965
(SMOOCHES) Come on now. She'll flip easy.
Isn't that the term you use?

23:45.048 --> 23:46.800
Yeah. You... you got to stop.

23:46.883 --> 23:51.680
-Tell me how lying only makes it harder.
-Jen, Jen, enough already.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.225
Jeez, I've been trying to call you
to tell you that I'm busy,

23:55.308 --> 23:56.643
but you haven't been answering your phone.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.186
I'm trying to maintain a little...

23:59.146 --> 24:00.605
-Forget it.
-I'm sorry. I'm just in the middle

24:00.689 --> 24:01.731
-of a huge case.
-I got it.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.692
Okay, it's 20 minutes up here,
it's 20 minutes back.

24:03.775 --> 24:07.696
-I can't take that time right now.
-I said I got it, okay?

24:07.779 --> 24:09.739
-(HANDCUFFS CLATTERING)
-(DOOR OPENING)

24:09.865 --> 24:12.200
-Where are you goin'?
-I need to put something on.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.661
I'm a little humiliated right now.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.329
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to humiliate you.

24:16.413 --> 24:20.167
You know, I've been trying here,
new things, expanding a little.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.502
-I'm getting shut down at every turn.
-It's just bad timing.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.922
Just tell me. Are we going
where I think we're going? Like downhill?

24:26.006 --> 24:29.092
Because if we are, then let's end it now,
and spare the dragged-out pain.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.011
Wait, this has nothin' to do
with going downhill.

24:31.094 --> 24:34.431
-I am working a case.
-Just go, all right?

24:34.556 --> 24:37.684
-Jen! Come on!
-Get out now!

24:38.059 --> 24:41.062
And you need to know that when I break
something off, I don't go back on it.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.689
-It's over.
-What the hell is goin' on?

24:42.772 --> 24:45.233
-This isn't you.
-Sorry, but it is me.

24:48.403 --> 24:49.404
Bye, John.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.288
(SIGHS)

25:15.889 --> 25:18.308
Devastating. It's just devastating.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.311
Yeah. We're very sorry
about your wife, Howard.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.104
Just when things were starting
to turn around.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.272
How so?

25:25.607 --> 25:27.359
We were finally talking again.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.487
Kurt and Nancy being arrested
turned out to be a real blessing.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.490
BALDWIN: Then why'd you bring a gun
into it? The rifle that killed your wife,

25:33.740 --> 25:35.700
we found it dumped outside
your bathroom window.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.995
It was to protect the apartment.
How could it be the gun that killed Nancy?

25:39.079 --> 25:42.415
-That's why we're here talkin', Howard.
-The thief must have found the gun.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.627
No, we're off the idea of a thief.
One of your family did this.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.547
-The kids wouldn't hurt their mother.
-How about you?

25:48.838 --> 25:51.716
I was in Hartford, Connecticut
on business.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.554
We got you in a motel in Jersey City,
ten minutes away.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.807
All right, I was in Jersey City,
but I didn't kill Nancy.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.726
I was reading the paper
in an IHOP all morning.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.854
-Why did you lie?
-Sometimes I tell the family

26:04.938 --> 26:09.067
I'm going to a meeting, when I'm really...
I'm... I'm out, letting off steam.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.486
Steam from what? Your wife?

26:12.070 --> 26:13.196
Your wife at your kid's throat?

26:13.363 --> 26:16.324
Sometimes it's better
if they work things out on their own.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.034
Apparently, that's what happened
this morning.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.161
No, no, no.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.039
-GREG: Did Kurt know about the gun?
-HOWARD: Absolutely not.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.417
You didn't leave it for him
in case your wife got violent again?

26:25.500 --> 26:28.336
-Of course not!
-So, you just got it for intruders.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.504
Yes!

26:31.131 --> 26:33.133
And you can't understand
how much pain I'm in

26:33.216 --> 26:35.510
knowing it was an intruder
Who got ahold of that gun

26:35.635 --> 26:41.975
and killed my wife. (SNIFFLES)
Which I know in my heart is what happened.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.813
Can I just have a minute, please? (SOBS)

26:57.657 --> 26:58.700
(DOOR CLOSING)

26:59.784 --> 27:02.245
Tell me again how long
you've been feeling ill, Connie.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.331
-I don't know. Three weeks
-Hmm.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.251
-And how long since your last period?
-Two months.

27:08.501 --> 27:11.171
-That didn't raise any flags?
-Well, since my pregnancy at 15,

27:11.254 --> 27:13.089
it's always been kind of irregular.

27:13.214 --> 27:15.258
What did your doctor tell you
after the pregnancy?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.094
Uh... It was a C-section delivery,

27:18.303 --> 27:20.889
and that I'd gotten
peritonitis afterwards.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.099
Because of that,
my fallopian tubes had occluded,

27:23.224 --> 27:24.434
and I couldn't get pregnant again.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.480
-Are you gonna tell me I have cancer?
-No.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.442
'Cause I've always worried
with my irregular periods and scar tissue

27:32.525 --> 27:33.902
that I might be susceptible.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.530
Actually, Connie,
you're about ten weeks pregnant.

27:39.616 --> 27:40.742
That's not possible.

27:40.950 --> 27:44.079
I know that's what you were told,
but I ran the test twice. You're pregnant.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.373
So, get used to the idea
of morning sickness,

27:46.456 --> 27:49.376
'cause you'll probably be in the thick
of it for, at least, another month.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.878
-My fallopian tubes...
-Not occluded enough.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.254
You're pregnant.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.131
Congratulations.

28:04.265 --> 28:05.266
First up, Kurt...

28:05.934 --> 28:08.144
the intruder theory is out. It's gone.

28:08.395 --> 28:11.439
You're talkin' about the guy who did this
to me? What? He doesn't exist?

28:11.690 --> 28:16.861
Your dad told us he brought home a rifle
for intruders. Turns out it's the same one

28:16.986 --> 28:19.072
that was dropped out
of your apartment window.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.825
The way we're puttin' it together,
your mom was on your ass for somethin',

28:21.908 --> 28:23.993
-and it got violent.
-I was in my room and...

28:24.077 --> 28:26.329
She was on your ass.
It came to blows like before.

28:26.496 --> 28:27.914
You got scared for your life,
and went for the gun.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.583
GREG: With the history of abuse
in your house, you won't do a day,

28:30.709 --> 28:33.128
-but you gotta lay it out for us.
-I didn't do it.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.715
Kurt, you afraid of puttin' your dad
in the middle of this?

28:36.881 --> 28:40.093
-He was in Connecticut.
-(SIGHS) He was in Jersey City.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.054
Do you think he's responsible
for your mom bein' killed,

28:43.138 --> 28:45.932
-but you don't wanna get him in trouble?
-There was an intruder.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.811
Nobody brings a gun into a home like yours
unless he expects it to be used.

28:50.311 --> 28:53.940
-My dad had nothin' to do with this.
-Did he tell you where he kept the gun?

28:54.023 --> 28:55.608
I didn't know about a gun.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.111
He didn't show you
where the ammo was, or how to load it?

28:58.278 --> 28:59.571
And then skip town?

29:04.617 --> 29:05.618
I shot her.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.664
But my dad had nothing to do with it.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.501
Now, if we're gonna keep you out of jail,
we need the full truth.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.920
(SNIFFLES) I saw him hide the gun.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.923
He never showed it to me.
He never told me how to load it.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.884
All right,
so what happened at the apartment?

29:20.967 --> 29:22.802
She laid into me about the arson...

29:23.720 --> 29:26.681
about how she was going to jail,
about how ungrateful I was,

29:27.098 --> 29:31.352
and then she hit me with this paperweight.
So, I got the gun, and I shot her.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.314
-When did your sister come into it?
-She came home right after.

29:34.397 --> 29:36.691
And that's when you came up
with the intruder story?

29:37.567 --> 29:40.528
I threw the gun out the window.
I also called 911.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.781
All right, Kurt.
You're really helping yourself here.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.574
But it's not right,
you taking the blame alone.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.869
-That's how it happened.
-Just tell me if you think

29:47.952 --> 29:50.455
your dad bringin' the gun
into the apartment

29:50.538 --> 29:54.250
-had to do with more than just intruders.
-I shot my mom.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.462
That's all you need to know.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.136
We've been running this Ron Hanler
through the wringer,

30:05.220 --> 30:07.222
and he's not gettin' any better
for the homicides,

30:07.305 --> 30:08.556
but he's not getting any worse.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.350
You check with the bartenders
at The Time Bar?

30:10.558 --> 30:13.770
Yeah, they remember seein' him there,
but he's at these joints all the time.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.688
Any direct connection with the other DOAs?

30:15.897 --> 30:17.690
Nah, nothin' past them goin'
to the same bars. Still, he's got no alibi

30:17.774 --> 30:19.609
Still, he's got no alibi
for this mornin' or yesterday.

30:20.193 --> 30:21.945
Which could be on account of livin' alone,

30:22.237 --> 30:24.948
meanin', uh, he hasn't been lyin'
to us about his alibi.

30:25.031 --> 30:27.492
Personality-wise, what kinda guy
are we talking about here?

30:27.575 --> 30:29.244
Mm, wimp. He cried in the interview.

30:29.911 --> 30:33.873
Uh... The super at Ann Healy's building,
Steven Debrees, his alibi's no good.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.543
-How so?
-I just got off with Celeste Villalobos,

30:36.626 --> 30:39.879
his supervisor at the public library
where he volunteers. He wasn't there.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.048
-She's sure?
-Well, she knows she didn't see him.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.342
She asked around,
and none of the other volunteers saw him.

30:44.467 --> 30:46.761
And he wasn't on the sign-in sheet.
I also ran his description

30:46.845 --> 30:50.557
by the bartenders at The Capsule Bar.
They think they've seen him around.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.309
-Did you get in touch with Debrees?
-He wasn't in his apartment,

30:53.393 --> 30:54.394
didn't answer his cell.

30:54.477 --> 30:56.563
Crime Scene finish up
over at Healy's apartment?

30:56.646 --> 30:59.065
-An hour ago.
-He said he'd be in there cleanin' up.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.441
We'll go talk to him.

31:02.277 --> 31:05.029
-Hey, Doc.
-Lieutenant, h... how are you feeling?

31:05.196 --> 31:07.365
-Never better.
-Hey, Jen.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.908
-You got a minute?
-Yeah.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.498
(CLEARS THROAT)
You went to see the doctor?

31:16.040 --> 31:19.168
Yeah, something I ate.
Nothing to worry about.

31:26.593 --> 31:29.888
When I was 17,
I was diagnosed as manic-depressive.

31:30.513 --> 31:33.725
For a long time,
I managed it with medications.

31:33.850 --> 31:37.645
The problem is,
the medications kill my sex drive.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.565
-Jen...
-Just hear me out.

31:43.276 --> 31:44.777
Taking the meds was...

31:45.570 --> 31:48.573
fine through college,
medical school, and residency,

31:48.656 --> 31:51.451
because I had something to concentrate on.

31:52.952 --> 31:56.956
But then I met you,
and I could tell how special you were.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.959
So, I... I stopped taking the medication.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.170
And that's why you've been acting
the way you were?

32:04.589 --> 32:08.551
When I'm in a manic phase,
everything feels great.

32:08.718 --> 32:12.013
But when I feel myself sliding
into depression, I'd...

32:13.306 --> 32:15.391
Take uppers to stay up.

32:16.893 --> 32:19.187
You don't have to say anything.
I just want you to know

32:19.312 --> 32:21.356
that I'm gonna go back on my medication.

32:23.816 --> 32:26.361
-Is there anything I can do to help?
-No.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.364
I know this is a lot to lay
on you all of the sudden,

32:29.447 --> 32:31.824
and I don't have any right
to ask this, but...

32:32.700 --> 32:34.202
we'll take it a step at a time.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.998
JENNIFER: I knew I was losing you,
and I don't want to.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.875
We'll take it a step at a time.

32:49.133 --> 32:52.762
We spoke with your brother again, Alison.
He's writing a statement.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.181
-Saying what?
-He confessed to shooting your mom.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.435
Now, what you need to do
is give your own truthful statement.

32:59.686 --> 33:02.897
You do that, and we'll forget
about how you lied to us this morning.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.109
-What's going to happen to Kurt?
-He's gonna be arrested for murder.

33:08.444 --> 33:10.029
He's lying.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.824
-Kurt's lying.
-He's writing it up.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.617
If you want to help him now,
shine some light

33:14.701 --> 33:16.577
-on why your dad brought the gun home.
-No.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.497
No. I shot my mom.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.792
We appreciate you wanting to get Kurt
out of this...

33:22.875 --> 33:25.837
No, I shot her. They were fighting.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.965
She... she was beating on his head
with a paperweight.

33:29.590 --> 33:33.845
(SNIFFLES, SOBS)
She was going to kill him!

33:34.303 --> 33:37.557
So, I got the gun
out of my dad's closet...

33:39.100 --> 33:41.477
-and I shot her!
-All right, let's just calm down...

33:41.602 --> 33:43.229
No, you're not listening!

33:43.396 --> 33:45.231
You watched your brother
take a lot of beatings.

33:45.356 --> 33:48.109
You think he doesn't deserve to do time
for this. We understand.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.612
-And we will work to minimize that time.
-No, no.

33:51.821 --> 33:54.741
But throwing yourself on the grenade
is just gonna muck that up.

33:54.824 --> 34:00.580
No, I shot her! I swear to you!
(CRIES) I shot her! (SNIFFLES)

34:06.210 --> 34:07.378
Debrees, you here?

34:09.005 --> 34:10.006
(THUDDING)

34:10.882 --> 34:11.966
Debrees?

34:16.387 --> 34:17.638
These clothes weren't out before.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.682
Hello?

34:20.808 --> 34:21.809
(CLATTERING)

34:23.394 --> 34:25.271
Hey. (WHISTLING)

34:27.857 --> 34:30.026
ANDY: Come out,
or I throw a shot through the door.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.903
STEVEN: Please leave.

34:32.028 --> 34:35.239
That ain't gonna happen!
You got two seconds. One...

34:35.406 --> 34:38.534
-I'm just getting dressed.
-Put your hands up. Get out of there.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.745
-Could you give me a minute?
-Get your hands up!

34:40.828 --> 34:42.038
Fine, okay.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.211
May I please get dressed now?

35:06.979 --> 35:09.440
All right, first, let's make it clear
that you can both do time for this.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.568
If one of you is protecting the other,
now's the time to clear the air.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.654
They love their mother.
They wouldn't kill her.

35:14.821 --> 35:17.323
Mr. Ackerman,
you're here to encourage them

35:17.406 --> 35:20.660
to tell the truth,
not to lay on more bullshit.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.538
Now, if this is something
that you did together,

35:23.704 --> 35:26.124
or planned together,
that's something that we need to hear.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.292
It's the only way
the abuse comes to light.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.379
-I just got the gun, and I shot her.
-Stop it, Kurt.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.965
-You got to stop it now.
-It's my fault.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.591
What's going on here?

35:36.592 --> 35:38.344
Guys, why would you say you hurt your mom?

35:38.594 --> 35:40.888
-Just let it go, Dad.
-Kurt, was there an accident

35:41.055 --> 35:42.682
-with the gun?
-Don't answer that.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.058
-Ali...
-(ALISON SNIFFLING)

35:44.142 --> 35:46.644
...sweetie, I'm sure
Kurt appreciates you standing up for him,

35:46.769 --> 35:49.272
but if he did something wrong,
he needs to answer for it.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.399
Why should he answer
for something that's your fault?

35:51.899 --> 35:55.611
-How is it your dad's fault?
-My mom would beat on Kurt,

35:56.112 --> 35:59.240
yell at him, and call him worthless.
And what did you do about it?

35:59.490 --> 36:02.451
-Everything in my power.
-You weren't there this mornin'.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.998
You've never been there.
(SNIFFLES) Someone had to protect him!

36:08.457 --> 36:09.667
Is that what happened this morning?

36:09.959 --> 36:13.713
She was slamming the paperweight
into his head.

36:13.921 --> 36:16.632
I had to stop her before she killed him!

36:17.008 --> 36:21.637
-Is your sister telling the truth?
-Kurt, it's over now. Come on.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.392
-(SNIFFLING)
-(SIGHS)

36:30.104 --> 36:32.899

sayin' that she was gonna kill me...

36:33.149 --> 36:34.609
(ALISON SOBBING, SHUDDERING)

36:34.984 --> 36:36.569
...and Ali saved my life.

36:40.531 --> 36:43.868
-I can't believe this. I'm stunned.
-ALISON: How can you say that?

36:43.951 --> 36:45.870
It's been coming for years.

36:46.078 --> 36:48.664
Police would come,
but you wouldn't let them in.

36:48.831 --> 36:51.292
You'd say we could take care
of it ourselves.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.754
Maybe I tried to deal with things
my own way internally,

36:54.879 --> 36:57.048
but I never meant for you
to use the gun.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.133
-(SCOFFS)
-Is that true?

36:59.634 --> 37:03.095
He came home two days ago,
and said he put something in his closet,

37:03.471 --> 37:04.722
that it was off-limits,

37:04.805 --> 37:07.516
-and we weren't allowed to look in there.
-Knowin' damn well they would.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.894
-Actually, I thought they'd obey me!
-Liar.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.562
-Alison.
-Liar!

(SHUDDERS, SOBS)

37:18.819 --> 37:21.155
What were you doin'
in the dead girl's panties?

37:22.657 --> 37:26.118
I just like to wear women's things.
I was cleaning up Ann's apartment.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.620
She had nice clothes.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.332
I'm wasting my time, aren't I?

37:31.457 --> 37:33.251
Tell us about your relationship,
you and Ann.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.920
I told 'em before,
we just knew each other to say hello.

37:36.003 --> 37:38.422
And you also told us before
you were volunteering for the library.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.467
-And that wasn't true, either, was it?
-Sometimes my supervisor doesn't see me.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.637
Now, don't waste our time on that, either,
Debrees, you knew Ann Healy.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.972
You were obsessed with her.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.516
And that's the only way you wind up
in her undies after she's dead.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.810
Well, you just have
all the answers, don't you?

37:51.018 --> 37:53.396
You said before she had a lot of guys
in and out of her place.

37:53.729 --> 37:56.399
-Were you jealous of that?
-I told you I was gay.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.026
That doesn't jibe
with you wearing her clothes.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.529
That tells me
you wanted to get closer to her,

38:01.612 --> 38:04.657
-or maybe you were in love with her.
-I still say he's a fag.

38:04.824 --> 38:09.161
-You don't know anything!
-Steven, tell me. Tell me.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.164
Did you have feelings for Ann?

38:13.708 --> 38:17.420
Did you express them to her recently?
Maybe ask her out?

38:17.795 --> 38:19.422
She call you a creep? Tell you to beat it?

38:19.505 --> 38:22.133
-I don't want him talking anymore.
-You lose your mind when she said that?

38:22.258 --> 38:25.594
-Tell him to leave me alone.
-Oh, he'll back off when you're honest.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.305
Until then, I can't help you.

38:30.891 --> 38:35.354
When someone loves you, and they've been
saving up to tell you for months,

38:35.521 --> 38:37.898
you don't just shut the door
in their face.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.942
You push in on her, smack her on the head?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.987
(EXHALES) She pushed me first.

38:45.072 --> 38:47.158
I reacted, and she hit her head.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.618
-Why'd you strangle her?
-STEVEN: She was yelling.

38:50.703 --> 38:51.829
I didn't wanna hurt her.

38:55.374 --> 38:58.127
All right, Steven, uh, I need to ask you.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.922
-Was this the first time you hurt someone?
-What do you mean?

39:02.131 --> 39:05.634
Have you ever heard the names Angela Pratt
or Pam Riegert?

39:05.760 --> 39:06.927
The other girls.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.848
-Did you hurt them too?
-Yes, I did.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.353
And I want a full-page photo

39:15.436 --> 39:17.897

"Lady Killer."

39:18.064 --> 39:20.816
Yeah, all right. But right now tell us
what happened with Pam and Angela.

39:20.983 --> 39:24.070
"Lady Killer."
And I wanna do television interviews.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.160
You gotta confirm something for us,
Steven.

39:31.243 --> 39:33.245
Angela Pratt and Pam Riegert
were strangled

39:33.329 --> 39:35.164
with a very specific color rope.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.041
We didn't tell the press what that was.

And the dad was out of state at the time?

40:01.357 --> 40:03.859
-Across the river.
-Still, he wasn't in the vicinity.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.778
-He provided the weapon.
-A legal weapon,

40:05.861 --> 40:08.364
which he didn't need a carry,
or target permit for.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.241
Well, that just says he did his homework.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.451
Did you find any record
of a hunting license?

40:12.576 --> 40:13.661
He did apply for one.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.498
Then yeah, he really did do his homework,
and there's nothing to collar him for.

-I spoke to my bureau chief.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.294
She'll have to testify
in front of the grand jury,

but with the family history,

40:24.046 --> 40:27.383
and Alison fearing for her brother's life
while he was being assaulted,

40:27.466 --> 40:29.468
she may get away
with justifiable homicide.

40:29.552 --> 40:33.055

He could've stopped this a long time ago.

about the other two homicides.
