<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"... </i>

00:01.642 --> 00:03.093
<i>Ty: Okay, I didn't know
Aida was gonna be here</i>

00:03.127 --> 00:05.833
- and she's not my ex-girlfriend.
- You two never hooked up?

00:05.834 --> 00:07.608
We did, but she wasn't my girlfriend.

00:07.612 --> 00:09.413
Well, that makes it much better.

00:09.447 --> 00:11.548
If I did somehow get
myself stationed locally,

00:11.582 --> 00:12.549
I don't know what I would tell the guys.

00:12.583 --> 00:14.384
But if something were to happen to me...

00:14.419 --> 00:16.353
It might make someone grow up real fast.

00:16.387 --> 00:18.221
This is complicated for me.

00:18.256 --> 00:19.489
- (Baby crying)
- Did I do something wrong?

00:19.524 --> 00:22.075
No, no, no, it's okay. It's
okay, baby, I'm right here.

00:22.126 --> 00:23.160
She's just used to me.

00:23.194 --> 00:25.128
- That baby in there...
- Her name is Abby.

00:25.163 --> 00:27.197
- I'm her father.
- No, I'm her father... Leo and I.

00:27.231 --> 00:29.933
Did Leo and Victor just
decide to give her up?

00:29.967 --> 00:33.003
No. The judge agreed...
Abby belongs with her father.

00:33.037 --> 00:34.137
This wedding...

00:34.172 --> 00:36.840
- Don't you want it to happen?
- No.

00:36.874 --> 00:39.776
- Parker, what's wrong?
- I'm sleeping with my boss... Senator Coto.

00:39.811 --> 00:41.678
He told me his wife is
beginning to suspect.

00:41.712 --> 00:43.480
- You know Chip Coto?
- Yeah.

00:43.514 --> 00:45.449
The coffee guy and I blackmailed him.

00:45.483 --> 00:47.467
You are not going to get away with this.

00:47.502 --> 00:49.386
- Who's that?
- Chip Coto.

00:49.420 --> 00:50.520
We need to fix this, like now.

00:53.524 --> 00:54.658
Yeah, I'm watching it right now.

00:54.692 --> 00:56.576
Thanks for bringing it to my attention.

00:56.611 --> 00:59.296
<i>Nah, I'll take care of this myself.</i>

01:02.500 --> 01:04.400
<i>John: So did you and Jennice just figure</i>

01:04.435 --> 01:07.304
<i>it would be easier to convince
the kids to cancel the wedding</i>

01:07.338 --> 01:09.940
<i>after the peacocks arrived?</i>

01:09.974 --> 01:12.876
We just haven't figured out
the right time to talk to them.

01:12.910 --> 01:14.845
All right. At this point might as well wait

01:14.879 --> 01:17.080
till the minister says,
"if anyone objects... "

01:17.115 --> 01:18.882
You know, you could say something too.

01:18.916 --> 01:20.951
Oh my gosh.

01:20.985 --> 01:23.720
I thought you were
joking about the peacocks.

01:23.754 --> 01:25.655
Kathryn has a friend who raises rare birds,

01:25.690 --> 01:26.873
so how could we resist?

01:26.908 --> 01:28.792
Kathryn: What do you think?

01:28.826 --> 01:31.595
I mean, I know I said I didn't
want anything extravagant,

01:31.629 --> 01:34.498
but this is gorgeous. Thank you,

01:34.532 --> 01:35.699
all of you.

01:35.733 --> 01:38.602
Yeah, guys, this is amazing. Thank you.

01:40.371 --> 01:41.738
You're welcome.

01:41.772 --> 01:44.307
<i>- Toby: Ready-o?
- Nikki: Yeah, ready.</i>

01:44.341 --> 01:46.476
We are gonna check out this
apartment in Brookside...

01:46.511 --> 01:48.612
huge windows, washer and dryer...

01:48.646 --> 01:51.381
- And it's cheap.
- Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap.

01:51.415 --> 01:53.350
- Listen, kids...
- Oh, dad,

01:53.384 --> 01:55.318
I think this guy needs
a signature from you.

01:55.353 --> 01:57.103
Oh.

01:57.155 --> 01:58.872
All right, thanks. I'll see you guys later.

01:58.906 --> 02:00.991
Nick, Nick, can I talk to you a sec?

02:01.025 --> 02:03.176
Oh, we have an appointment
with the landlord. Can it wait?

02:06.964 --> 02:08.131
- I guess so, yeah.
- Okay.

02:12.870 --> 02:14.955
Looks like this wedding ship has sailed.

02:17.708 --> 02:18.875
(Calling)

02:18.910 --> 02:21.545
(Exhales)

02:26.851 --> 02:30.453
Well, I am definitely
gonna miss the Maui uniform.

02:30.488 --> 02:32.389
Not as much as I'm gonna miss yours.

02:32.393 --> 02:36.163
Uh, hey, do you know
where my hair thing is?

02:36.167 --> 02:37.167
Yeah.

02:41.062 --> 02:43.980
Ah, yes, the universal do-not-disturb sign.

02:44.015 --> 02:46.233
Didn't want to take any chances.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.837
I hope we get to have at least
one last pineapple freeze.

02:50.872 --> 02:52.806
Maybe.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.741
I ship out on the 15th.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.743
That's three days away.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.712
Yeah.

03:00.081 --> 03:02.015
Well, it's a good thing

03:02.049 --> 03:03.967
we have my brother's wedding to go to,

03:04.018 --> 03:06.620
because otherwise I would
not be leaving this room.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.823
Hey.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.625
It's gonna be okay.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.530
I don't know what I'm dreading more...

03:16.564 --> 03:18.465
insurgents firing at you

03:18.499 --> 03:21.434
or you and that hot medic
together for months in a tank.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.403
(Laughs)

03:23.437 --> 03:25.188
All right, relax.

03:25.223 --> 03:27.174
Aida and I will not be in a tank.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.109
We're gonna be in a Humvee.

03:29.143 --> 03:32.045
Hey, I told you,

03:32.113 --> 03:34.214
you don't have to worry
about that stuff, okay?

03:35.356 --> 03:39.159
Besides, we're only gonna be in Afghanistan

03:39.193 --> 03:41.127
for, like, three months.

03:41.162 --> 03:43.096
And then they're putting us

03:43.130 --> 03:45.832
at a base in Germany
for the rest of the time.

03:45.866 --> 03:47.767
Which is only one continent away, so yay.

03:47.802 --> 03:49.736
But it's not a war zone.

03:49.770 --> 03:51.705
I know.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.909
Can't you just go straight to
Germany and skip the war zone?

03:58.846 --> 04:01.581
Right.

04:08.322 --> 04:10.457
(Clears throat)

04:13.444 --> 04:15.395
Ivan.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.264
Hi, John.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.232
Why don't you have a seat?

04:19.267 --> 04:21.233
You want to tell me what this is all about?

04:21.269 --> 04:23.103
I filled Ivan in

04:23.137 --> 04:25.204
on what the party's freshman
Senator's been up to.

04:25.222 --> 04:28.208
And I've convinced him not
to alert the authorities,

04:28.242 --> 04:30.043
at least not for now.

04:30.077 --> 04:32.779
I know you're the one
behind those texts, John.

04:32.813 --> 04:34.748
- What texts?
- Oh, come on, John.

04:34.782 --> 04:36.816
This is gonna go a lot faster if
you don't pretend we're stupid.

04:36.851 --> 04:38.785
You know, I thought it
was just your daughter

04:38.819 --> 04:40.720
who had an axe to grind about sex ed,

04:40.755 --> 04:43.590
but breaking into my office...
both of your interns...

04:43.624 --> 04:44.958
You didn't think I'd put it together?

04:44.992 --> 04:46.760
Just back up a second, okay?

04:46.794 --> 04:48.828
(Chuckles) I have no idea

04:48.863 --> 04:50.797
what either of you are talking about.

04:50.831 --> 04:52.699
Someone broke into your office?

04:52.733 --> 04:54.401
Your daughter did,

04:54.435 --> 04:56.369
along with your future daughter-in-law.

04:58.372 --> 05:00.340
This was Friday, close to midnight.

05:00.374 --> 05:02.292
(Clicks key)

05:04.378 --> 05:07.347
Now you want to tell me what
the hell they were doing in here?

05:10.318 --> 05:12.419
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:16.290 --> 05:19.059
So you and Jace actually thought

05:19.093 --> 05:21.261
you could get away with
blackmailing a senator?

05:21.295 --> 05:24.230
We didn't think it would get this far.

05:24.265 --> 05:27.133
And why is Nikki breaking
into Coto's office with you?

05:27.168 --> 05:29.135
I thought she supported
the whole abstinence thing.

05:29.170 --> 05:32.322
She was just helping me to erase a message

05:32.356 --> 05:34.441
that I left on his answering machine.

05:34.475 --> 05:38.011
I couldn't hear it, so I
asked her to come with me.

05:38.045 --> 05:40.080
I mean, are you that desperate to make sure

05:40.114 --> 05:41.331
that kids get condoms in school?

05:41.365 --> 05:42.449
No.

05:42.483 --> 05:44.351
I mean, yes, I think they should,

05:44.385 --> 05:46.353
but it's Coto.

05:46.387 --> 05:48.338
He goes around telling people

05:48.372 --> 05:50.357
that they shouldn't have sex,

05:50.391 --> 05:53.126
and he's cheating on
his wife with his intern,

05:53.160 --> 05:55.095
and he's so smug about it all!

05:55.129 --> 05:57.130
So you thought you were gonna
what, teach him a lesson?

05:57.164 --> 05:59.165
I don't know.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:08.175 --> 06:10.143
Coto thinks

06:10.177 --> 06:13.012
that I am behind all of this,

06:13.047 --> 06:15.982
that I am somehow a mastermind

06:16.016 --> 06:17.984
who's trying to make him
look bad to the party.

06:18.018 --> 06:20.286
I'll just tell him that you
had nothing to do with it,

06:20.321 --> 06:22.355
- it was all me.
- You have done enough.

06:22.390 --> 06:25.191
I am taking over from here.

06:27.261 --> 06:30.196
I never saw this coming.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.134
Not from you.

06:41.242 --> 06:43.209
(Applause)

06:43.227 --> 06:44.377
Thank you, Felix.

06:44.395 --> 06:47.347
143 whirl-arounds without
a customer vomiting

06:47.381 --> 06:50.066
- is most certainly a record.
- (Laughter)

06:50.101 --> 06:52.385
Now in these past few months,

06:52.420 --> 06:54.354
this next employee has learned

06:54.388 --> 06:57.073
how to combine the Hawaiian aloha spirit

06:57.108 --> 07:00.193
with the work ethic of
the great state of Kansas.

07:00.227 --> 07:02.328
Come do a victory hula for us,

07:02.363 --> 07:05.064
Bay Kennish, most improved employee!

07:05.082 --> 07:08.001
(Cheering and applause)

07:08.035 --> 07:09.369
Wow.

07:09.403 --> 07:12.005
Winning this award means

07:12.039 --> 07:14.040
that I sucked when I started.

07:14.074 --> 07:16.409
But it also means

07:16.427 --> 07:18.962
that I suck just a little less now.

07:19.013 --> 07:20.246
- (Mouths)
- Whoo!

07:23.434 --> 07:25.185
<i>Mac: All right, guys,</i>

07:25.219 --> 07:27.137
let's make our last day in Maui, Kansas,

07:27.188 --> 07:29.222
a safe, happy and profitable one.

07:30.257 --> 07:33.276
Bay, are we okay?

07:33.360 --> 07:35.411
Totally. We fought. It's fine.

07:35.446 --> 07:37.163
Yeah, I feel terrible.

07:37.198 --> 07:39.165
I should have never
yelled at you like that.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.251
You were right about Ty though.

07:41.285 --> 07:43.419
I can't believe I asked
him to ditch his unit.

07:43.454 --> 07:45.488
Well, the fact that he even considered it

07:45.506 --> 07:47.490
shows how much he cares about you.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.325
Yeah.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.294
I have total faith in you guys.

07:51.328 --> 07:54.163
You two are, like, my
couple role model right now.

07:54.181 --> 07:56.115
You and Travis will carve
your own unique path.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.100
I'm very psyched for the two of you.

07:58.118 --> 07:59.235
Thanks.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.804
Shall we go kill off
the rest of the sharks?

08:01.839 --> 08:03.206
(Both chuckle)

08:03.240 --> 08:06.743
Yeah, thanks, Larry. No no, I got it.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.678
<i>Okay, I'll get back to you.</i>

08:10.080 --> 08:11.714
How bad is it?

08:11.749 --> 08:14.751
Best-case scenario, it's a
teenage prank gone wrong...

08:14.785 --> 08:16.886
misdemeanor, attempted extortion,

08:16.921 --> 08:18.788
which is community service and a fine.

08:18.822 --> 08:21.657
Do I even want to know the worst case?

08:21.675 --> 08:24.527
She used a phone to transmit a threat.

08:24.562 --> 08:27.497
That is a federal felony.
That could mean jail time.

08:27.531 --> 08:30.717
Do they seriously have nothing better to do

08:30.768 --> 08:33.602
than prosecute a teenage girl for a prank?

08:33.636 --> 08:36.139
It's a worst-case scenario.

08:36.173 --> 08:39.142
She's a deaf honor student
from east riverside.

08:39.176 --> 08:41.344
Or an entitled brat from mission hills.

08:41.378 --> 08:43.313
And then there's the whole Carlton thing.

08:43.347 --> 08:46.316
You know, the court will not look on
that as some noble victory, all right?

08:46.350 --> 08:48.317
She broke the law, and now it's a pattern.

08:48.335 --> 08:51.321
Oh, God. I should have
known something was up.

08:51.355 --> 08:53.990
This whole summer started out so well.

08:54.024 --> 08:57.060
No, Daphne's a smart kid.
She should have known better.

08:57.094 --> 08:59.028
We have to do something.

08:59.063 --> 09:02.865
Her life can't be ruined
because of one bad choice.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.701
<i>(Door opens)</i>

09:04.735 --> 09:07.503
Hey, I just wanted to let you know

09:07.538 --> 09:09.555
that I'm back and I'm all settled in.

09:14.378 --> 09:15.678
What is it?

09:18.768 --> 09:20.702
<i>Regina: What is it with
you and boys lately?</i>

09:20.736 --> 09:22.838
First you lose your head over this chef

09:22.872 --> 09:24.840
and give up a great job,

09:24.874 --> 09:26.942
and now this Jace kid
has you breaking the law?

09:26.976 --> 09:28.827
<i>Do you want to go to jail?</i>

09:28.878 --> 09:31.680
Do you think I did this
because a guy pushed me into it?

09:31.714 --> 09:32.747
I don't know.

09:32.782 --> 09:35.484
You taught me to stand up for what's right.

09:36.519 --> 09:37.652
What?

09:37.687 --> 09:39.588
I did not teach you to blackmail.

09:39.622 --> 09:43.225
Guys like Coto work the
system and trade favors

09:43.259 --> 09:45.494
so they can keep their
fancy houses and golf dates.

09:45.528 --> 09:47.395
And you know what? It makes me sick.

09:49.265 --> 09:51.266
Are you gonna start
lecturing me about racism

09:51.300 --> 09:52.501
and the death penalty, too?

09:52.535 --> 09:54.402
You think you are the first person

09:54.436 --> 09:56.271
to discover injustice in the world?

09:56.305 --> 09:58.504
All I'm saying is that I
had a really good reason

09:58.505 --> 09:59.505
for doing everything I did.

09:59.508 --> 10:02.344
Well, tell that to a
judge and see if he cares.

10:02.346 --> 10:04.080
Or she.

10:07.817 --> 10:09.951
<i>- (Knocks on door)
- (Abby crying)</i>

10:11.921 --> 10:14.689
- Thank God. Thank God.
- I come not as your mother-in-law,

10:14.724 --> 10:17.025
but as your baby nurse.
Regina sent me. What's wrong?

10:17.043 --> 10:18.994
I lost this stuffed animal.

10:19.028 --> 10:21.897
I must have left it at the park. Shh.

10:21.931 --> 10:23.865
Well, don't you have any other toys?

10:23.900 --> 10:25.734
No, no, no, she needs this one.

10:25.768 --> 10:27.552
When you squeeze it, it plays some lullaby.

10:27.587 --> 10:29.638
I don't know what it is, but
it puts her right to sleep.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.356
Well, we'll buy another.

10:31.407 --> 10:33.575
I looked everywhere. I
can't find it anywhere.

10:33.609 --> 10:35.644
Then where did it come from?

10:35.678 --> 10:38.346
- Here.
- (Speaking Spanish)

10:41.450 --> 10:44.452
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.

10:44.487 --> 10:47.222
Your daddy's gonna make everything okay.

10:47.256 --> 10:49.090
(Clicking tongue)

10:49.125 --> 10:52.160
Honey, look what I found in Toby's studio.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.362
It's thick and very official-looking.

10:54.397 --> 10:56.298
Cleaning again?

10:56.332 --> 10:58.900
I'm not pretending anymore. Just snooping.

10:58.935 --> 11:02.237
I think he got accepted
to Wash U. And it's open.

11:02.271 --> 11:04.806
Go ahead. I need some good news.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.874
Huh.

11:05.908 --> 11:07.842
Well?

11:07.877 --> 11:10.812
There's nothing about the Wash U wait list.

11:10.846 --> 11:13.615
On the upside, Toby doesn't have chlamydia.

11:13.649 --> 11:14.950
What?

11:14.984 --> 11:16.751
It's from the free clinic.

11:16.786 --> 11:19.821
Do you think he slept with
someone since he's been engaged?

11:19.855 --> 11:21.623
Or did she? I mean, what does it mean?

11:21.657 --> 11:23.792
- That we should stop reading Toby's mail.
- Yeah.

11:23.826 --> 11:25.727
Hey, guys.

11:25.761 --> 11:28.330
Look, I know stuff's been crazy,

11:28.364 --> 11:29.764
with the wedding and everything,

11:29.799 --> 11:33.201
but I really need you to sign off
on my new class schedule today.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.303
I thought we already did that.

11:35.338 --> 11:39.074
Uh, well, I'm adding a few classes.

11:39.108 --> 11:41.142
So you're taking another math class

11:41.177 --> 11:42.410
and history too?

11:42.445 --> 11:45.146
I want to graduate in December

11:45.181 --> 11:47.248
and go to art school in Berlin.

11:47.283 --> 11:49.985
Universitat Der Kunste...

11:50.019 --> 11:51.219
I'm gonna learn how to say it.

11:51.253 --> 11:54.923
It is one of the best
art schools in the world,

11:54.957 --> 11:56.725
and I don't want to wait
until next September.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.693
Oh.

11:58.728 --> 12:01.796
Any chance that Ty is going
to be stationed in Germany?

12:01.831 --> 12:04.599
Yeah, he is.

12:04.634 --> 12:07.469
But it is also an amazing school.

12:07.503 --> 12:09.671
Honey, I don't think you
should let a boy determine

12:09.705 --> 12:11.706
what school you go to again.

12:11.741 --> 12:13.341
Again?

12:13.376 --> 12:14.643
Emmett, Carlton.

12:14.677 --> 12:17.245
I did not go there because of him.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.546
And I ended up making the honor roll...

12:18.581 --> 12:21.116
something I never did at Buckner.

12:21.183 --> 12:24.419
Look, maybe Ty being there
made me look the school up,

12:24.453 --> 12:27.055
but after I read about it,

12:27.089 --> 12:29.024
I really want to go.

12:29.058 --> 12:31.326
They've got a street art program
and a political art major.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.061
Okay, okay, okay.

12:33.095 --> 12:35.030
We're gonna take a look at this

12:35.064 --> 12:37.098
- and we'll discuss it.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.800
I didn't say we agreed.

12:38.834 --> 12:41.736
I said we would discuss.

12:41.771 --> 12:43.138
Germany?

12:43.172 --> 12:45.874
She's not committing a
felony or getting married.

12:45.908 --> 12:48.943
Right now, for us, that's a win.

12:48.978 --> 12:50.912
Yeah.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.584
(Knocks)

12:56.619 --> 12:58.753
Well, look who's back.

12:58.788 --> 13:01.256
Can I come in?

13:01.290 --> 13:03.591
You leave something behind the other night?

13:07.530 --> 13:10.265
I'm sorry that I broke into your office.

13:10.299 --> 13:12.100
Who are you doing this for?

13:12.134 --> 13:14.035
Nobody.

13:14.070 --> 13:16.037
What does your father want, Daphne?

13:16.072 --> 13:18.039
John didn't know anything about this

13:18.074 --> 13:20.208
until you showed him
the video. It was all me.

13:20.242 --> 13:22.077
Oh, come on, you can't expect me to believe

13:22.111 --> 13:23.912
- you did this all on your own.
- I did.

13:23.946 --> 13:26.781
You hurt Parker and I didn't
want that bill to pass,

13:26.816 --> 13:28.783
that's all.

13:28.818 --> 13:30.719
Look, I know it's asking for a lot,

13:30.753 --> 13:33.521
but isn't there anything I could
do to make you forget about this?

13:35.825 --> 13:37.726
Please.

13:41.664 --> 13:44.666
Why don't you give your
dad a message for me?

13:47.436 --> 13:50.171
<i>(Helicopter blades whirring)</i>

13:50.189 --> 13:52.207
(People chattering)

13:57.279 --> 13:59.347
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.984
Hey, Mendoza, you hear the glorious news?

14:03.018 --> 14:06.020
- What news?
- What they got us going back over there for.

14:06.055 --> 14:09.824
- Motor pool backup.
- Nah, we're not gonna be at Camp Eggers.

14:09.859 --> 14:10.859
- We're not?
- Nope.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.811
We're gonna be out there with the grunts

14:12.862 --> 14:15.130
on the convoys, saving time
if the truck breaks down.

14:15.164 --> 14:17.665
And they've been getting
ambushed left and right...

14:17.700 --> 14:19.667
I.E.D.S, green-on-blue attacks.

14:19.702 --> 14:21.836
They said it was a redeployment to Eggers.

14:21.871 --> 14:23.738
Well, I guess they changed their minds.

14:23.773 --> 14:25.774
That's probably what Staff
Sergeant's about to tell us.

14:25.808 --> 14:27.876
I'm kind of ready to see
some action, you know?

14:27.910 --> 14:30.478
I mean, that's how you gotta look at it.

14:30.513 --> 14:32.347
Yeah yeah, for sure.

14:32.381 --> 14:35.550
I hope you got all your stuff
together with legal, you know...

14:35.584 --> 14:38.470
your will and all that.
It's heavy stuff, man.

14:40.389 --> 14:42.557
<i>Everyone get settled. Quiet down.</i>

14:42.591 --> 14:45.092
We're heading out in 72 hours

14:45.110 --> 14:47.061
and we've got a lot to go over.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.330
<i>Now for most of you this
will be a review of protocol</i>

14:49.365 --> 14:51.199
<i>that you're already more
than familiar with...</i>

14:51.233 --> 14:54.202
Hey, you got a single room, right?

14:54.236 --> 14:57.172
- Yeah.
- Think I could borrow it this week?

14:57.206 --> 14:59.774
My lady still lives with her folks,

14:59.809 --> 15:01.743
and we've got a lot of goodbye-ing to do,

15:01.777 --> 15:03.711
you know what I mean?

15:03.746 --> 15:05.747
Yeah, yeah, man. That's fine.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.699
Thanks, brother.

15:07.733 --> 15:09.684
Sure.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.189
John: This is all I need
a day before the wedding.

15:16.223 --> 15:17.624
I told you to leave this to me.

15:17.658 --> 15:19.359
But I thought I could fix it.

15:19.393 --> 15:23.096
Okay, you tell me exactly what he said.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.199
He said that if you strongly endorse

15:26.233 --> 15:28.234
his reelection campaign,

15:28.269 --> 15:31.037
that this could all just go away.

15:31.072 --> 15:33.406
So I guess you show up

15:33.441 --> 15:36.009
to his campaign events and...

15:36.043 --> 15:37.243
No no no no.

15:37.278 --> 15:39.913
He wants me to write him a check.

15:39.947 --> 15:43.116
He just said "endorse."

15:43.150 --> 15:45.051
Trust me,

15:45.086 --> 15:48.989
he wants me... to pay.

15:52.927 --> 15:55.929
$50,000? Five-zero?

15:55.963 --> 15:57.897
That's the number he thinks it will take

15:57.932 --> 15:59.899
to make the whole thing go away.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.802
Wow, if I knew there was gonna
be blackmail and break-ins,

16:02.837 --> 16:04.771
I never would have left.

16:04.805 --> 16:07.707
That's way more exciting than Maui, Kansas.

16:07.725 --> 16:10.310
You should have seen his face

16:10.344 --> 16:12.412
when he found out.

16:12.446 --> 16:14.648
Oh, I know that look. It's awful.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.582
But he gets over it.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.185
This is different.

16:19.220 --> 16:21.321
I stole money from the carwash

16:21.355 --> 16:23.556
to bail my friend out of jail,

16:23.591 --> 16:27.127
then tried to run away to
Mexico, and he forgave me.

16:27.161 --> 16:29.329
But you're his daughter.

16:31.298 --> 16:33.967
You know what I mean.

16:35.269 --> 16:37.904
He won't stay mad forever.

16:37.938 --> 16:40.940
I think he's gonna get a whole lot angrier

16:40.975 --> 16:43.143
after he writes the check.

16:43.177 --> 16:45.111
<i>John: How many people did we</i>

16:45.146 --> 16:47.797
<i>invite to this rehearsal dinner anyway?</i>

16:49.850 --> 16:51.117
Sushi, huh?

16:51.152 --> 16:54.788
You've got a looser definition
of barbecue than I do.

16:54.822 --> 16:58.591
I just wanted something that
would make me feel happy.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.894
Making small talk pretending
this makes me happy

17:00.928 --> 17:02.562
is exhausting.

17:02.596 --> 17:04.631
They're so cute together.

17:04.665 --> 17:07.500
Oh, please. In two years I'll
be paying for the divorce.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.771
Mr. Scarecrow to the rescue.

17:12.807 --> 17:14.758
Thank you. Please.

17:16.510 --> 17:18.411
I can't believe I lost it.

17:18.445 --> 17:19.645
Don't feel bad. We've all done it.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.415
That's actually the third Mr. Scarecrow.

17:22.449 --> 17:24.184
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:24.218 --> 17:26.352
My mother-in-law Adrianna. This is Leo.

17:26.369 --> 17:28.387
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.390
You have to tell me where
you get these things.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.293
My mother actually makes them.

17:33.327 --> 17:36.029
Oh, hi, baby girl.

17:36.063 --> 17:37.363
Look at how beautiful you are.

17:37.381 --> 17:39.015
Hi.

17:39.049 --> 17:41.101
<i>We talk about you every day.</i>

17:41.135 --> 17:44.037
(Chuckling) Yes, we do.

17:44.071 --> 17:47.674
Hi.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.909
Oh, sweetie, I missed you too.

17:52.012 --> 17:54.814
This was a mistake.

17:54.849 --> 17:57.951
<i>- Uh, sorry.
- (Abby crying)</i>

17:57.985 --> 17:59.919
It's fine, Leo. It's fine.

18:02.690 --> 18:06.359
Uh, I should go.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.729
Uh...

18:09.764 --> 18:11.514
Yeah, I don't want to confuse her.

18:11.565 --> 18:14.451
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

18:20.357 --> 18:22.475
Shh, shh, shh.

18:28.349 --> 18:30.349
<i>(Quiet music playing)</i>

18:34.421 --> 18:36.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.896
Do you remember that house

18:42.930 --> 18:45.031
that my mom and I wanted on Avalon Street?

18:45.065 --> 18:47.066
Brick, with a garden?

18:48.803 --> 18:51.037
I thought that place was a mansion...

18:51.071 --> 18:53.807
three bedrooms, a backyard, a dishwasher.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.609
- (Chuckles)
- Impossible dream.

18:56.644 --> 18:59.846
Regina kept hoping she'd win the lottery.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.748
Do you know how much it cost?

19:01.782 --> 19:04.417
Huh-uh.

19:04.451 --> 19:06.786
$56,000.

19:06.820 --> 19:10.690
Well, it still sounds
like a lot of money to me.

19:13.327 --> 19:15.261
Me too.

19:23.337 --> 19:26.472
We are a long way from East Riverside.

19:26.506 --> 19:28.441
Yeah, we are.

19:32.313 --> 19:34.180
You all right?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.415
No.

19:37.117 --> 19:39.052
When did she turn insufferable,

19:39.086 --> 19:42.288
acting like what she and this coffee
kid did was something courageous?

19:42.323 --> 19:44.224
I know,

19:44.258 --> 19:47.093
but I did a lot of stupid
things when I was her age.

19:47.127 --> 19:49.062
This stupid?

19:49.096 --> 19:52.098
I let my boyfriend convince
me not to use a condom

19:52.132 --> 19:54.067
more times than I care to admit.

19:54.101 --> 19:57.871
And I had this girlfriend who
drove like a complete maniac

19:57.905 --> 19:59.806
and I kept getting in her car.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.975
There was this kid I
went to high school with

20:02.009 --> 20:04.844
who got brain damage from
skateboarding without a helmet.

20:04.879 --> 20:06.579
- His mom was a nurse.
- I know.

20:06.584 --> 20:08.785
It's like their brains are lit
up with these flashing lights

20:08.786 --> 20:10.604
that say, "yes, go, faster."

20:10.638 --> 20:12.739
I'll take that. It's ok. Here.

20:17.678 --> 20:20.413
John told me what you guys

20:20.431 --> 20:22.415
were thinking about doing
to get her out of this mess.

20:22.449 --> 20:25.485
Yeah, I know. I'm embarrassed about that.

20:25.519 --> 20:27.520
If there was any other way...

20:27.555 --> 20:30.290
I was gonna thank you.

20:30.324 --> 20:32.358
If the you-know-what hit the fan on this,

20:32.393 --> 20:35.161
I had no idea how I was gonna help.

20:37.331 --> 20:40.800
Right now she is damn
lucky she's a Kennish.

20:43.771 --> 20:45.905
(Laughing, chattering)

20:45.940 --> 20:48.041
Toby: I don't think we have ever had

20:48.075 --> 20:50.727
like, a real man-to-man
conversation about this.

20:52.646 --> 20:54.664
(Dings glass)

20:57.718 --> 20:59.752
They told me that would
work on you hearies.

20:59.787 --> 21:02.622
(Laughter)

21:02.656 --> 21:04.340
Welcome.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.326
I'm Emmett,

21:06.360 --> 21:09.329
Toby's best man.

21:09.363 --> 21:11.297
I also play drums

21:11.332 --> 21:13.299
in a band with those two.

21:13.334 --> 21:15.468
We're available to play
parties, by the way.

21:15.502 --> 21:17.370
(Laughter)

21:19.340 --> 21:22.242
But sitting there, behind the drums,

21:22.276 --> 21:24.210
I saw a lot.

21:24.245 --> 21:26.112
I got to see these two

21:26.146 --> 21:28.047
really connect through music.

21:28.082 --> 21:31.050
And I also got to see them fall in love.

21:34.204 --> 21:36.189
I know some people,

21:36.223 --> 21:38.157
myself included,

21:38.192 --> 21:40.059
may have thought they
were a little too young

21:40.094 --> 21:41.995
to take this step.

21:42.029 --> 21:45.665
But when you find the
one who's right for you,

21:45.699 --> 21:48.735
you hang on tight.

21:48.769 --> 21:50.570
Because if you don't...

21:52.006 --> 21:53.973
they can slip away.

21:58.545 --> 22:00.546
To Toby and Nikki.

22:00.581 --> 22:03.416
Hang on tight and enjoy the ride.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.368
All: Cheers.

22:12.559 --> 22:14.577
I thought that went well.

22:14.628 --> 22:16.562
What's wrong?

22:16.597 --> 22:19.232
It's obvious that you're
not happy about this,

22:19.266 --> 22:21.434
but could you guys try to fake
it a little better tomorrow?

22:21.468 --> 22:24.304
Okay, your mother and I would be lying

22:24.338 --> 22:26.306
if we didn't tell you that
we're having second thoughts.

22:26.340 --> 22:29.075
Let's be honest... it's
been your only thought.

22:29.109 --> 22:31.928
We just don't want you
to make a mistake, honey.

22:31.962 --> 22:33.947
So you want me to cancel the wedding?

22:39.053 --> 22:41.921
It's, like, the hottest art
school in the world right now.

22:41.939 --> 22:43.823
And if I get in,

22:43.857 --> 22:45.825
I can be there by the
first week of January,

22:45.859 --> 22:47.627
so we're only apart for four months.

22:47.661 --> 22:49.962
You want to go to school in Berlin?

22:49.980 --> 22:51.864
<i>Ja. That's the amazing part.</i>

22:51.899 --> 22:53.700
I didn't know until I
started checking it out...

22:53.734 --> 22:55.668
Berlin is, like, the epicenter of awesome.

22:55.703 --> 22:58.438
And the I.C.E... that's the
inner city express train...

22:58.472 --> 23:00.373
can get me to Stuttgart in under two hours.

23:00.407 --> 23:02.375
You don't look amazed.

23:02.409 --> 23:04.644
I am. I just...

23:04.678 --> 23:08.398
you know, no one knows
what's gonna happen, so...

23:08.449 --> 23:10.550
I know what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna meet you in Germany.

23:10.584 --> 23:13.386
Okay, I think we should just take a beat.

23:13.420 --> 23:15.555
What does that mean?

23:18.492 --> 23:21.227
This summer has been great,

23:21.261 --> 23:23.196
but everything that's
happening right now...

23:23.230 --> 23:24.330
maybe it's best we keep it simple.

23:24.365 --> 23:27.233
We could just leave with good memories.

23:27.267 --> 23:29.869
I don't want to keep it
simple. What are you doing?

23:29.903 --> 23:31.971
This plan could work. You know it could.

23:32.006 --> 23:34.007
Hey. Sorry.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.826
I think "J" and "K" are
trying to blow up the wedding.

23:36.860 --> 23:38.878
<i>- What?
- They're in the kitchen with Toby</i>

23:38.912 --> 23:40.847
and he looks really upset,
but I'm the last person

23:40.881 --> 23:42.882
- to say anything right now.
- (Sighs)

23:42.916 --> 23:46.452
Okay, can we hit the pause button
on this for, like, five minutes?

23:46.470 --> 23:48.638
Okay, just don't go anywhere.

23:55.796 --> 23:57.497
And you were in on this too?

23:57.531 --> 23:59.298
I tried to find a time to bring it up.

23:59.333 --> 24:01.567
Well, maybe our rehearsal
dinner wasn't the best option.

24:01.602 --> 24:04.237
The point is, we've all been 18 years old.

24:04.271 --> 24:06.539
Believe it or not, we all
remember what it was like

24:06.573 --> 24:10.143
to be so sure that the way
we felt would never change.

24:10.177 --> 24:11.444
But you will change.

24:11.478 --> 24:14.230
The next 10 years of your
life are all about change.

24:14.281 --> 24:17.350
Exactly... exploring, finding yourself.

24:17.384 --> 24:19.986
What if they want to do that together?

24:20.020 --> 24:21.354
- Thank you.
- Be together,

24:21.388 --> 24:23.089
just don't make it legally binding.

24:23.123 --> 24:25.091
That way, if it doesn't
work out, no harm, no foul.

24:25.125 --> 24:27.060
Bay: God, listen to you guys.

24:27.094 --> 24:29.796
All you can see is failure.

24:29.830 --> 24:31.898
I know. I mean, what are you doing?

24:31.932 --> 24:33.900
These guys really love each other.

24:33.934 --> 24:35.968
<i>Kathryn: We're not against love.</i>

24:36.003 --> 24:39.572
We're just asking you to take some time.

24:39.606 --> 24:41.774
Well, what if there isn't time?

24:41.809 --> 24:43.726
What if now is all we have?

24:43.777 --> 24:47.497
Shouldn't we try to be
together as much as we can?

24:47.548 --> 24:48.714
How old were you when you married dad?

24:48.749 --> 24:50.683
Maybe not much older, but, you know,

24:50.717 --> 24:53.686
sometimes I wish that I
had taken some more time

24:53.720 --> 24:56.389
to really find myself.

24:56.423 --> 24:58.491
Go to Peru. Manage the car wash.

24:58.525 --> 25:00.543
He'll still be here when you get back.

25:00.577 --> 25:03.262
- Honey, go to Wash U.
- How did you know about that?

25:03.297 --> 25:05.231
You got into Wash U?

25:05.265 --> 25:08.267
Uh, I put myself back on the waiting list.

25:08.302 --> 25:10.236
Well, that's great. Why
wouldn't you tell me that?

25:10.270 --> 25:13.372
It seems like something that you
would share with your future spouse.

25:13.407 --> 25:15.341
Because I didn't get in yet.

25:15.375 --> 25:18.144
Oh, for God's sake,
could someone just say it?

25:18.178 --> 25:20.146
If you two want to have
sex, then go have sex.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.915
<i>- You're not going to hell.
- Mom.</i>

25:24.118 --> 25:25.785
<i>Jennice: Sorry.</i>

25:25.819 --> 25:27.987
Thank you, guys.

25:29.957 --> 25:30.923
<i>(Door closes)</i>

25:33.940 --> 25:35.140
Look, the application was
filed, okay? I'm sure of it.

25:35.174 --> 25:36.791
I don't know. I never saw the permit.

25:41.948 --> 25:44.633
No, they can't do that.
We just broke ground.

25:44.684 --> 25:46.050
No, I can't, not tonight. What?

25:47.987 --> 25:50.655
No, just let me know, okay?

25:50.690 --> 25:51.789
Thanks.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.827
- She's asleep.
- Yeah, for an hour.

25:55.862 --> 25:57.696
Is everything okay?

25:57.730 --> 26:00.432
The contractor for the restaurant

26:00.466 --> 26:01.700
doesn't have one of the work permits

26:01.734 --> 26:03.702
and he wants me to come down
and talk to the neighbor tonight.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.570
I would stay if I could...

26:05.605 --> 26:08.473
No, it's fine. You've been here too long.

26:08.508 --> 26:10.308
You need a break.

26:11.477 --> 26:14.212
I don't know how anyone can do this alone.

26:14.247 --> 26:16.548
They don't.

26:16.582 --> 26:18.283
You need help.

26:18.317 --> 26:20.202
And if you don't have family,

26:20.253 --> 26:22.354
you pay for the help, and that's okay.

26:22.388 --> 26:24.990
I am terrible at this.

26:25.024 --> 26:28.126
Everyone thinks that at
first. You just need time.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.061
I fought so hard to get her.

26:30.096 --> 26:31.329
And now that I got her...

26:32.865 --> 26:34.799
I don't know, maybe I'm selfish.

26:34.834 --> 26:37.035
Or too old.

26:37.069 --> 26:39.037
I don't know.

26:39.071 --> 26:42.073
Well, are you keeping her

26:42.108 --> 26:43.942
to prove something...

26:43.976 --> 26:46.811
that you're not the same man

26:46.846 --> 26:48.647
who left another daughter behind?

26:48.681 --> 26:49.714
No, I'm not.

26:49.749 --> 26:54.486
Or to prove something to yourself?

27:00.293 --> 27:01.693
You know,

27:01.727 --> 27:04.296
everyone was angry at Regina

27:04.330 --> 27:07.499
for not coming forward when
she found out about the switch.

27:07.533 --> 27:10.435
But she genuinely did

27:10.469 --> 27:14.072
what she thought was right for the girls.

27:16.175 --> 27:18.209
Yeah.

27:18.244 --> 27:20.278
Well,

27:20.313 --> 27:22.230
I'll see you at the wedding.

27:22.265 --> 27:24.215
Okay.

27:30.022 --> 27:32.023
<i>(Door opens)</i>

27:34.877 --> 27:36.828
<i>(Knocks on door)</i>

27:36.862 --> 27:39.664
- Hello. Ty.
- Hey.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.866
This is why you left
early... to do laundry?

27:41.901 --> 27:43.735
I didn't want to get into
a thing with you there.

27:43.769 --> 27:45.403
What do you mean, a thing?

27:45.438 --> 27:47.539
Why aren't you excited
about my Germany plan?

27:47.573 --> 27:50.342
Because I don't think it makes sense.

27:50.376 --> 27:52.344
(Sighs) Look...

27:53.779 --> 27:57.248
if you're worried that it's gonna
be like last time, it won't be.

27:58.684 --> 28:01.252
Those aren't mine.

28:06.392 --> 28:08.193
Oh my God.

28:08.227 --> 28:10.328
Uh, Bay...

28:10.363 --> 28:13.031
Aida?

28:14.233 --> 28:16.234
You slept with Aida?

28:17.336 --> 28:21.006
Um...

28:21.040 --> 28:24.175
maybe it's because we're shipping out,

28:24.210 --> 28:26.745
I don't know,

28:26.779 --> 28:29.047
but it just happened.

28:33.853 --> 28:35.787
I'm sorry.

28:38.658 --> 28:41.426
<i>Toby: Well, this is nice.</i>

28:44.480 --> 28:46.598
Is this your dress?

28:46.632 --> 28:48.700
It's very pretty.

28:48.734 --> 28:50.669
Yeah.

28:52.271 --> 28:55.273
You weren't supposed to see it.

28:55.307 --> 28:59.077
Do you think maybe they're right?

28:59.111 --> 29:04.082
That we're doing this just so we can... ?

29:04.116 --> 29:06.317
- Hey.
- (Exhales deeply)

29:06.352 --> 29:09.854
- Of course I want to have sex with you...
- (Both chuckle)

29:09.889 --> 29:13.224
But... I don't think we're getting married

29:13.259 --> 29:15.860
just so we can have sex.

29:15.895 --> 29:18.063
Do you?

29:18.097 --> 29:20.698
There's only one way to find out.

29:22.985 --> 29:24.652
Are you sure?

29:24.687 --> 29:25.904
Yeah.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.691
___

29:46.692 --> 29:48.626
Why do guys cheat?

29:54.820 --> 29:55.986
___

29:55.987 --> 29:58.369
Why did you cheat on me?

30:01.148 --> 30:04.229
___

30:04.230 --> 30:07.335
___

30:07.580 --> 30:10.115
How can it mean nothing?

30:10.149 --> 30:12.016
Sex is a big deal,

30:12.051 --> 30:14.085
and you don't just have
it with someone else

30:14.120 --> 30:16.054
because you're in a bad mood,

30:16.088 --> 30:17.989
or, you're in a fight with your dad

30:18.023 --> 30:20.158
or you're being sent overseas.

30:22.135 --> 30:23.645
___

30:26.298 --> 30:28.700
When you slept with Simone...

30:30.169 --> 30:32.804
I couldn't understand it.

30:32.838 --> 30:36.040
I figured it had to be
something that I didn't get

30:36.075 --> 30:38.977
because I hadn't had sex yet.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.612
But now I have...

30:43.582 --> 30:45.517
and I really don't get it.

30:45.518 --> 30:54.153
___

___

31:28.567 --> 31:32.203
<i>* Settling shapes into focus *</i>

31:36.374 --> 31:40.044
<i>* it's carrying all of the weight... *</i>

31:42.147 --> 31:44.248
Hi.

31:44.282 --> 31:46.217
I'm Toby.

31:46.251 --> 31:48.152
We met last night at the bar.

31:48.186 --> 31:51.121
That's very funny. (Giggles)

31:53.875 --> 31:56.794
(Deep sigh)

31:56.828 --> 31:59.930
Well, that happened.

31:59.965 --> 32:01.899
(Chuckles)

32:01.933 --> 32:05.603
Should we... high-five or something?

32:05.637 --> 32:07.805
I'm not gonna high-five you.

32:13.912 --> 32:15.546
Well...

32:16.581 --> 32:18.816
today is our wedding day.

32:21.419 --> 32:22.653
Or not.

32:27.392 --> 32:30.127
What do you want to do?

32:36.368 --> 32:38.269
- Hold still.
- Okay.

32:40.305 --> 32:43.274
At least now I have a legitimate
reason to hate this suit.

32:43.308 --> 32:45.342
It looks nice on you.

32:45.377 --> 32:47.878
- Where is Toby?
- (Phone chimes)

32:47.912 --> 32:49.847
It's getting kind of close to game time.

32:49.881 --> 32:51.849
Hold on a second.

32:57.188 --> 32:58.856
What?

32:58.890 --> 33:00.090
It's Toby.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.860
He says, cancel everything.
The wedding's off.

33:02.894 --> 33:05.095
Am I allowed to be happy?

33:07.065 --> 33:08.782
Thank you for coming.

33:08.817 --> 33:10.768
Of course. Is she all
right? What's going on?

33:10.802 --> 33:13.704
Abby's fine. She's napping.

33:13.738 --> 33:15.739
Then why am I here?

33:15.774 --> 33:17.775
Victor couldn't come?

33:17.809 --> 33:20.398
No, it's a three-hour drive, and frankly,

33:20.399 --> 33:21.399
he didn't want me to come either.

33:21.546 --> 33:23.681
I apologize for making you drive that long.

33:23.715 --> 33:25.749
No. We love Abby.

33:25.784 --> 33:27.718
We'll always think of her as ours.

33:27.752 --> 33:30.321
And as much as I want to come running

33:30.355 --> 33:33.457
every time I hear that
she's upset, I can't.

33:33.491 --> 33:35.492
Do you know what an open adoption is?

33:37.429 --> 33:40.130
We can't pop in and out
of her life like that,

33:40.165 --> 33:42.299
just seeing her every now
and then and getting letters.

33:42.334 --> 33:44.335
It's just... it's too hard.

33:54.913 --> 33:57.014
I mean the other way around.

34:06.091 --> 34:08.792
Would you want that?

34:10.094 --> 34:12.663
You know, with my other daughters

34:12.697 --> 34:16.033
we have a mix of biological
and other parents,

34:16.067 --> 34:19.670
and somehow it works.

34:19.704 --> 34:22.473
I think Abby will be better off

34:22.507 --> 34:23.841
with all of us in her life.

34:28.847 --> 34:31.447
Um, how... how would we do it?

34:31.483 --> 34:34.451
I will come every few weekends,

34:34.485 --> 34:36.487
birthdays, summers.

34:36.521 --> 34:38.355
Look, I don't know exactly...

34:39.524 --> 34:41.358
but I'm sure we can find an arrangement

34:41.393 --> 34:43.494
that makes everyone comfortable.

34:43.527 --> 34:45.529
(Chuckles)

34:49.501 --> 34:52.436
Oh, she's gonna have three dads.

34:52.469 --> 34:54.405
Yeah.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.157
You've got a real nice setup here.

35:17.796 --> 35:19.730
You're a lucky girl.

35:31.743 --> 35:33.660
<i>Jace: You want me to post this?</i>

35:33.711 --> 35:35.646
This would expose
Parker's affair with Coto.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.714
<i>Daphne: I got her okay.</i>

35:37.749 --> 35:39.766
You're sure about this?

35:39.818 --> 35:41.585
I could leave your name out of it.

35:41.619 --> 35:44.321
No.

35:44.355 --> 35:46.290
You're not a citizen.

35:46.324 --> 35:49.393
They'll revoke your visa
and you'll be deported.

35:49.427 --> 35:52.646
I'm not gonna let you take a fall for me

35:52.697 --> 35:55.482
when I'm the one who got us into this mess.

35:55.533 --> 35:58.469
We both did it.

35:58.503 --> 36:01.138
I'm just sorry I messed everything up.

36:01.172 --> 36:04.274
I keep telling you, you
weren't the only one.

36:04.309 --> 36:07.211
No, I mean with us.

36:07.245 --> 36:09.463
The first time I saw you

36:09.514 --> 36:12.349
fighting with Bay in sign language,

36:12.383 --> 36:14.318
I was mesmerized by you.

36:14.352 --> 36:16.987
What are you talking about?

36:17.021 --> 36:19.122
You were so mean to me after that.

36:19.157 --> 36:21.008
And it totally worked.

36:30.835 --> 36:33.187
We should have stuck to geocaching.

36:38.910 --> 36:42.746
So would you like to do the honors?

36:52.724 --> 36:55.492
- (Beeps)
- It's done.

37:04.886 --> 37:07.771
- M.B., what's up?
- What's the matter with you?

37:09.757 --> 37:12.659
- I guess she told you.
- Bay would have done anything for you.

37:12.693 --> 37:14.795
How could you sleep with someone else?

37:14.829 --> 37:16.697
How could you do that?

37:16.731 --> 37:20.484
Bay and I were a summer thing, okay?

37:20.518 --> 37:22.469
Well, I don't know who you are then,

37:22.487 --> 37:25.505
because the Ty I know would never do this.

37:25.540 --> 37:27.407
Well, I guess

37:27.425 --> 37:29.576
you don't know me that well.

37:40.221 --> 37:43.156
(Scoffs) You didn't do it.

37:45.393 --> 37:48.228
Listen, just don't worry about it, okay?

37:48.262 --> 37:50.430
Why are you lying about this?

37:52.200 --> 37:54.351
- I'm telling Bay.
- Hey, Mary Beth, no.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.204
No. Look, it's not that simple, okay?

37:58.923 --> 38:01.341
If something happens to me over there...

38:01.376 --> 38:02.919
So you're just gonna break her heart now?

38:02.920 --> 38:04.436
That doesn't make any sense.

38:04.912 --> 38:07.014
You of all people should get this.

38:07.048 --> 38:09.916
Okay, I saw what you
went through with Justin.

38:09.951 --> 38:12.986
I'm not gonna put Bay through that.

38:13.021 --> 38:16.189
I'd rather have her hate me
now and get on with her life.

38:18.076 --> 38:19.059
You can't tell her.

38:21.796 --> 38:23.714
Don't make me keep this from her.

38:23.765 --> 38:25.766
You have to, all right?

38:25.800 --> 38:27.096
I promised your brother

38:27.107 --> 38:28.662
that I would always look out for you.

38:28.663 --> 38:30.570
Now you have to promise this to me.

38:32.573 --> 38:34.675
Please.

38:40.882 --> 38:43.450

38:47.488 --> 38:49.423

38:49.457 --> 38:52.459
<i>there's a reporter from "The Star"
out here waiting to talk to you,</i>

38:52.493 --> 38:54.461
<i>a guy from "The Chicago Tribune,"</i>

38:54.495 --> 38:56.630
<i>and your wife on line one.</i>

38:56.664 --> 38:59.499
(Phone ringing)

39:16.184 --> 39:18.251
I was handling this.
What were you thinking?

39:18.286 --> 39:21.021
I'm so thankful that you
were willing to do that,

39:21.055 --> 39:23.023
but if I let you

39:23.057 --> 39:25.325
use your money and connections
to get me out of this,

39:25.359 --> 39:27.327
I wouldn't be any better than Coto.

39:27.361 --> 39:29.229
I couldn't live with myself.

39:29.263 --> 39:31.364
You could have at least given us a warning.

39:31.399 --> 39:34.167
I was afraid you'd talk me out of it.

39:34.201 --> 39:36.169
Yeah, you got that right, okay?

39:36.204 --> 39:38.371
My job is to protect you. How
am I gonna protect you now?

39:38.406 --> 39:42.175
Come on, our daughter told the truth.

39:43.978 --> 39:45.912
We can't be mad at her for that.

39:45.947 --> 39:47.914
But don't think for
one second we're not mad

39:47.949 --> 39:49.916
about everything else that you've done.

39:52.220 --> 39:55.188
So what's the next step?

39:55.223 --> 39:57.190
I call the lawyer and pray that

39:57.208 --> 39:59.960
you don't spend your senior year in prison.

No.
