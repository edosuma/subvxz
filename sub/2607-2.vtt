(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:16.995 --> 01:19.414
MITT ROMNEY: <i>This president is on track</i>
<i>to lose more jobs</i>

01:19.497 --> 01:21.875
<i>than any other president in modern history.</i>

01:21.958 --> 01:24.586
<i>We simply have to have an administration</i>

01:24.669 --> 01:27.464
<i>which has as its leader a person</i>
<i>who understands how business works.</i>

01:27.630 --> 01:29.090
(APPLAUSE)

01:29.174 --> 01:30.633
<i>And how the decisions we make</i>

01:30.717 --> 01:32.719
<i>from a tax and trade standpoint</i>

01:32.802 --> 01:34.304
<i>affect the creation of jobs.</i>

01:35.889 --> 01:36.890
Hey, Cameron.

01:37.515 --> 01:38.600
Good morning, sir.

01:38.683 --> 01:40.852
Come on, man,
you can't keep me off the bus again.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.437
According to Taliban law, I think I'm allowed

01:42.520 --> 01:45.106
to run over your face with the bus
while making your sister drink Clorox.

01:45.190 --> 01:46.649
Let's leave sisters out of this.

01:46.733 --> 01:47.734
You're right about that.

01:47.817 --> 01:48.985
- I can go on the bus?
- No, sir.

01:49.068 --> 01:50.487
You guys are running for president.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.988
You're gonna have to get used to bad press.

01:52.071 --> 01:53.782
But as a Republican campaign,

01:53.865 --> 01:55.450
what kind of experience
would we have with bad press?

01:55.533 --> 01:56.701
- Yeah...
- How would we build up

01:56.785 --> 01:57.911
that part of our immune system?

01:57.994 --> 02:01.456
Cameron, straight up, the story I file today
will be about how the governor

02:01.539 --> 02:03.541
wouldn't let an ACN reporter
on the press bus.

02:03.625 --> 02:06.127
And he'll experience
a five-point bump in the polls.

02:06.211 --> 02:07.629
- Cameron?
- Yeah?

02:07.712 --> 02:09.631
Let him on the bus.

02:09.714 --> 02:11.216
Go ahead.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.927
Thank you.

02:31.110 --> 02:32.111
Thanks.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.238
Just want to get going.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.157
I'm Jim Harper, ACN.

02:37.075 --> 02:38.868
How's Ben's ankle?

02:39.244 --> 02:40.620
It's broken.

02:48.044 --> 02:49.754
- The reporters were freed in Libya.
- MAN: We're reading it.

02:49.838 --> 02:51.339
- MAN 2: It's in <i>The Guardian.</i>
- We've all got it.

02:51.422 --> 02:54.342
Headline, "Journalists freed from Rixos Hotel
after being held by Gadhafi gunmen."

02:54.425 --> 02:57.554
- WOMAN: Stillman, we're all reading it.
- "The group were freed shortly after they..."

02:57.637 --> 02:58.680
- Seriously, Stillman!
- (ALL SHOUTING)

02:58.763 --> 03:00.223
MAN: We're reading the exact same thing
you are saying.

03:00.306 --> 03:01.975
HALA GORANI: (ON TV)
<i>These journalists who've been trapped</i>

03:02.058 --> 03:04.352
<i>for five-plus days at the Rixos Hotel</i>

03:04.435 --> 03:08.064
<i>in the five-star prison,</i>
<i>as it was known in Libya,</i>

03:08.147 --> 03:11.192
<i>are out, headed to a safer location.</i>

03:11.276 --> 03:13.444
<i>So, great news, as far as we're concerned.</i>

03:13.528 --> 03:15.446
<i>But the battle for Tripoli and...</i>

03:15.530 --> 03:16.739
It's me.

03:16.823 --> 03:18.700
- SLOAN: Are you all right?
- Sorry.

03:19.158 --> 03:20.159
Are you okay?

03:20.243 --> 03:21.369
Yes, totally.

03:22.996 --> 03:24.914
- Did you sleep here?
- I came in early this morning.

03:25.665 --> 03:27.375
It's 6:00 a.m.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.170
I'm moving back in with Lisa.

03:31.796 --> 03:34.173
I didn't really want anyone to see the bags.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.718
So would it be all right
if I kept them here till the end of the day?

03:36.801 --> 03:38.094
What happened?

03:38.177 --> 03:39.762
Don and I split up.

03:40.305 --> 03:41.347
Did he kick you out in the middle...

03:41.431 --> 03:43.391
No. No.

03:43.474 --> 03:44.559
He went to a hotel.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.728
Then I couldn't sleep,
so I just packed some stuff and came in.

03:46.811 --> 03:48.521
- You should call him. Take the...
- I've called him.

03:48.730 --> 03:49.772
I've called him a lot.

03:49.856 --> 03:50.940
He's not taking my calls.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.567
It's 6:00 a.m. He could be sleeping.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.277
If it goes to voice mail after two rings,

03:54.360 --> 03:56.112
they saw your name
and sent you to voice mail.

03:56.613 --> 03:58.072
- Really?
- Four rings, they're not there.

03:58.156 --> 04:00.450
Two rings, they don't want to talk to you.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.410
All right, I have to retrace my entire life now.

04:02.493 --> 04:03.620
But, you know, you and Don...

04:03.703 --> 04:05.705
It was all me. It was me.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.167
Is it okay if we don't talk about it?

04:09.709 --> 04:10.752
Yeah.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.712
I'm going down to the gym. You wanna come?

04:12.795 --> 04:14.255
- Uh, no.
- Yeah.

04:14.339 --> 04:15.506
Come take a shower and we'll get breakfast.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.550
The reporters are free, the ones from CNN...

04:17.634 --> 04:19.010
Yeah, I saw. Come on.

04:26.059 --> 04:27.101
(KNOCKS)

04:27.185 --> 04:29.187
- Yeah?
- I need to tell you a story

04:29.270 --> 04:31.356
Cyrus West told me last night after the panel.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.107
Cyrus West question mark?

04:33.191 --> 04:34.776
- Hmm, ellipses.
- I booked a bad guest.

04:34.859 --> 04:36.569
How long do you guys
give people shit in New York?

04:36.653 --> 04:37.612
Ask A-Rod.

04:37.695 --> 04:40.740
What story did Cyrus West tell you
after the panel?

04:40.823 --> 04:43.785
Have you ever heard anything
about a black op called Genoa?

04:43.868 --> 04:46.079
- Operation Genoa?
- Like the salami?

04:46.162 --> 04:48.706
Yeah, except it's named
for a kind of sail on a boat.

04:48.790 --> 04:53.503
- No.
- All right. Well, uh, this is gonna sound...

04:53.586 --> 04:55.630
I get that this is gonna sound crazy,

04:55.713 --> 04:57.882
but West says about a year ago,

04:57.966 --> 05:01.135
there was a MARSOC extraction
just across the border in Pakistan.

05:01.219 --> 05:03.179
Two of our guys were being held in a village

05:03.262 --> 05:05.473
along with civilians,
including women and children.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.892
And he says we used sarin gas.

05:09.060 --> 05:10.895
What made you think
that was gonna sound crazy?

05:10.979 --> 05:12.647
- I know that it's probably...
- Sarin gas?

05:12.730 --> 05:13.982
- On civilians?
- During an extraction.

05:14.065 --> 05:16.776
The first team of MARSOCs
were overrun by Taliban fighters,

05:16.859 --> 05:19.278
and a second wave of Marines
came in on a helicopter

05:19.362 --> 05:20.488
a minute later and dropped gas.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.241
- Sarin gas?
- Shh!

05:25.118 --> 05:28.329
What you're describing
would have involved about 50 people.

05:28.413 --> 05:31.040
Fifteen on the first wave,
15 on the second wave,

05:31.124 --> 05:33.001
a ground crew to load the gas on the helos.

05:33.084 --> 05:34.794
What 50 people could keep that secret?

05:34.877 --> 05:36.212
You know the name of the shooter
in Abbottabad?

05:36.295 --> 05:38.089
- No.
- Those 50 people, to start with.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.008
You think SEALs are better
at keeping a secret than MARSOCs?

05:40.091 --> 05:42.260
They're protecting the shooter's safety,
they didn't use nerve gas.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.012
I can't believe we're talking about nerve gas.

05:44.095 --> 05:45.763
- Do I have to go on?
- Mind if I ask you something?

05:45.847 --> 05:47.765
- No.
- If I was Jim, would you be paying attention?

05:49.100 --> 05:50.810
I am paying attention.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.937
J.D., you don't have to feel
competitive with Jim.

05:53.021 --> 05:55.857
Good, 'cause I was asked
to come fill in for him.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.860
I really don't want to get calls
from our DOD sources

05:58.943 --> 06:00.778
asking why we're pursuing a libelous story.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.488
Can you assume that I'm good at this?

06:02.572 --> 06:03.906
Can you assume the D.C. Bureau

06:03.990 --> 06:05.658
didn't hire a senior producer who's an idiot?

06:05.742 --> 06:08.327
- I never said...
- Can you do that?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.041
Make your calls.

06:13.458 --> 06:14.709
Thank you.

06:14.792 --> 06:18.171
'Cause on the off chance
it turns out to be true...

06:18.254 --> 06:20.256
I'll be there to see you accept your Peabody.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.549
That wasn't even close
to what I was gonna say.

06:21.632 --> 06:22.717
Lighten up, man.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.887
On the off chance it turns out to be true,
people are gonna have to resign.

06:25.970 --> 06:29.724
Jerry, you're talking
about a massive war crime.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.726
On the off chance it turns out to be true,

06:31.809 --> 06:33.895
people would have to go to prison.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.605
(KNOCKS)

06:36.481 --> 06:37.732
Will asked me to come get you.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.318
What was it supposed to be called again?

06:42.403 --> 06:44.822
You can say whatever you want
in front of anyone who works here.

06:44.906 --> 06:46.908
- That's why they work here.
- Genoa.

06:46.991 --> 06:47.992
Like the city.

06:48.076 --> 06:49.243
Like the headsail on a boat.

06:49.327 --> 06:51.412
Cool. Anything else?

06:51.496 --> 06:53.164
Nope.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.628
- Why's your hair all wet?
- They don't have blow-dryers in the gym.

06:58.711 --> 07:01.255
Do you have a minute today
when Gary and I could pitch you Africa?

07:01.339 --> 07:03.132
You can't pitch me Africa. It's a huge place.

07:03.216 --> 07:06.094
You've got to be specific.
That's what's wrong with your pitches.

07:06.177 --> 07:08.262
- Good morning.
- I'm really glad you're here.

07:08.346 --> 07:10.306
Elliot and Sloan
have been talking about closets for...

07:10.389 --> 07:12.100
We're well into our sixth minute now.

07:12.183 --> 07:14.602
My wife has always dreamed
of having a walk-in closet,

07:14.685 --> 07:16.312
so I've hired a contractor
and I'm building her one.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.522
Have you ever built an extension
on your house?

07:17.605 --> 07:18.606
Never had a house.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.690
It's like Vietnam. You can't get out.

07:19.774 --> 07:21.025
Is it going to be great?

07:21.109 --> 07:22.151
- The closet?
- Yeah.

07:22.235 --> 07:23.820
On paper, in theory, yeah.

07:23.903 --> 07:27.156
It's supposed to have
a whole shoe emporium, and a vanity

07:27.240 --> 07:28.574
and a little step stool and a sunken, uh...

07:28.658 --> 07:30.451
- Minute seven.
- Don't stop.

07:30.535 --> 07:32.662
See, this is what I'm talking about.
Women and closets.

07:32.745 --> 07:34.372
What about men and showers?

07:34.455 --> 07:36.040
I've got an awesome shower.
I love my shower.

07:36.124 --> 07:37.667
Where is she
keeping her clothes in the meantime?

07:37.750 --> 07:39.585
- My closet.
- And where are you keeping your clothes?

07:39.669 --> 07:41.212
- The shower.
- Oh, dude.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.047
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

07:43.131 --> 07:44.257
Do you want to do this or me?

07:44.340 --> 07:45.633
- Go ahead.
- Will's been...

07:45.716 --> 07:46.884
- I should tell 'em.
- What's going on?

07:46.968 --> 07:49.846
The two of you are going to anchor
the 9/11 anniversary coverage.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.055
I've been taken off.

07:52.223 --> 07:53.224
What are you talking about?

07:54.809 --> 07:56.227
- Oh, fuck that!
- No way.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.728
- Hang on.
- Reese took you off?

07:57.812 --> 07:59.689
It wasn't Reese and it wasn't Leona.

07:59.772 --> 08:01.607
It was me. It was my decision.

08:01.691 --> 08:03.651
Then we'll sit here until
we've talked you out of it.

08:03.734 --> 08:06.445
- Nobody leaves.
- That sounds like something I'd enjoy, but...

08:06.529 --> 08:08.739
- Why?
- In about an hour, I'm going to be

08:08.823 --> 08:10.324
officially condemned
on the floor of the House.

08:10.408 --> 08:12.743
We. We're going to be officially condemned.

08:12.827 --> 08:14.537
- We all did the broadcast.
- We know about that.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.247
There are boycotts and protestors,

08:16.330 --> 08:17.999
and Reese got kicked out of a SOPA meeting,

08:18.082 --> 08:21.335
and mostly there are 9/11 widows
and widowers and first responders...

08:21.419 --> 08:23.087
What, like,
seven first responders out of hundreds?

08:23.171 --> 08:25.339
- If all it is is one...
- There's always gonna be one.

08:25.423 --> 08:27.383
I'm bad news right now.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.510
When I called the Tea Party
the American Taliban,

08:29.594 --> 08:32.430
there were people who thought
I was being reductive about the Taliban,

08:32.513 --> 08:33.973
and the 9/11 anniversary isn't...

08:34.056 --> 08:35.516
How were you
being reductive about the Taliban?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.643
The Tea Party doesn't throw acid at people.

08:37.727 --> 08:39.353
- But that's not the point.
- What is the point?

08:39.437 --> 08:42.064
The point is I'm not
who I used to be right now.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.694
It's not right that
I inflict myself on a profound...

08:46.777 --> 08:48.196
- Jesus.
- ...national day of mourning.

08:48.279 --> 08:50.323
So on the 9th or 10th, I'm going to get the flu,

08:50.406 --> 08:52.533
and you guys are gonna take my desk.

08:54.619 --> 08:56.204
That's it. It's not a big deal.

08:56.287 --> 08:57.705
All right?

08:57.788 --> 09:00.625
I'll give you any help you need,
but you'll nail it.

09:02.001 --> 09:04.003
- Anything else?
- No.

09:11.469 --> 09:12.970
It wasn't your decision, it was Charlie's.

09:13.221 --> 09:14.222
I know, I was just saving...

09:14.305 --> 09:15.514
Charlie doesn't need you
to protect him from...

09:15.598 --> 09:17.391
- I wasn't protecting Charlie.
- Why didn't you just tell them?

09:17.475 --> 09:19.352
It's embarrassing.

09:23.314 --> 09:24.315
Right.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.535
JIM: Excuse me.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.704
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name before.
- Hallie.

09:38.788 --> 09:40.414
Would you mind just framing me up?

09:40.498 --> 09:41.666
Sure.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.883
- Am I good?
- Yeah, go ahead.

09:51.926 --> 09:54.679
Governor Romney began
a 36-hour campaign swing

09:54.762 --> 09:56.931
through the Granite State
here at the rec center

09:57.014 --> 09:58.140
in Keene, New Hampshire, where questions

09:58.224 --> 10:00.518
ranging from Mr. Romney's health care...

10:00.601 --> 10:02.395
That camera is pointed
nowhere near my face, right?

10:02.812 --> 10:04.188
We're competitors.

10:11.570 --> 10:12.655
(KNOCKS)

10:18.077 --> 10:19.203
Troy Davis.

10:19.829 --> 10:21.289
I think he's going to get clemency.

10:21.372 --> 10:22.623
- I don't.
- Why?

10:22.707 --> 10:24.792
He's a black guy accused
of killing a white cop in Georgia.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.419
That hardly ever goes well for the black guy.

10:26.502 --> 10:27.920
He's not accused, he's convicted.

10:28.004 --> 10:29.839
And it didn't turn out great
for the white cop, either.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.632
- He spent 20 years in a cell...
- I know.

10:31.716 --> 10:32.883
- Seven of the nine witnesses...
- I know.

10:32.967 --> 10:34.135
...have recanted their testimony,

10:34.218 --> 10:35.553
- and of the two left, one of them...
- Don.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.054
...is the primary alternate suspect.

10:37.138 --> 10:38.723
I've been covering the story, just like you.

10:38.806 --> 10:39.932
Not just like me.

10:40.016 --> 10:41.434
- You're right.
- I've been covering it for nine years.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.644
I go down there every six months.
We write letters.

10:43.728 --> 10:45.021
I know the man.

10:45.104 --> 10:46.230
There's reasonable doubt all over the place,

10:46.314 --> 10:47.565
and in three weeks, we're gonna kill him.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.192
- Unless he gets clemency.
- Unless he gets clemency.

10:50.276 --> 10:51.569
So can I suggest something?

10:51.652 --> 10:53.279
- More coverage?
- Different coverage.

10:53.362 --> 10:56.157
As a former prosecutor,
you can walk us through the trial

10:56.240 --> 10:57.700
and the appellate process like nobody else.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.702
- Pressure that was put on the DA's office...
- Listen.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.163
...for an indictment,
how that can motivate them to take the path...

11:02.246 --> 11:03.748
No.

11:05.708 --> 11:08.044
- Just no?
- He had a trial and the jury reached a verdict.

11:08.127 --> 11:09.795
Half of those jurors say
they've changed their minds.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.839
He was granted an appeal
and the upper court decided...

11:11.922 --> 11:14.216
- Burden of proof on appeal is set so high...
- I know.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.218
...that seven of the nine witnesses
recanting didn't matter.

11:16.302 --> 11:17.720
And now he gets a clemency hearing,

11:17.803 --> 11:19.597
and then he can try his luck
with the Supreme Court.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.849
He's received, and is receiving, due process.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.517
It's not right for me to re-litigate the case.

11:23.601 --> 11:25.686
That's a thin argument
when a guy's life is on the line.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.646
No, it's not. Twenty years have passed.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.357
Witnesses get fuzzy. They feel bad.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.233
They're hounded by reporters and activists

11:31.317 --> 11:33.235
and "What if I fucked up?" nightmares.

11:33.319 --> 11:35.780
And as a former prosecutor,
I'd be pissed as hell

11:35.863 --> 11:39.200
if some guy with an anchor desk and
an audience started second-guessing my...

11:39.283 --> 11:43.245
Can you imagine how little I give a shit
about the prosecutor's feelings?

11:44.205 --> 11:45.414
With the presumption of innocence,

11:45.498 --> 11:50.002
a jury of his peers reached a verdict
and found him guilty.

11:50.086 --> 11:52.546
And then they looked him in the eye
and sentenced him to death.

11:52.630 --> 11:54.340
Did Troy have
the best possible legal counsel?

11:54.423 --> 11:55.591
No, but on appeal...

11:55.674 --> 11:58.594
On appeal he was represented
by the Georgia Resource Center,

11:58.677 --> 12:00.471
which stated in an affidavit

12:00.554 --> 12:03.599
that the work that they
were doing on his behalf was akin to triage.

12:03.682 --> 12:06.060
"We were simply trying to avert total disaster

12:06.143 --> 12:10.147
"rather than provide
any kind of effective or active representation."

12:11.273 --> 12:13.984
In your file, you have a commendation

12:14.068 --> 12:15.403
from Judge Bernard Sittenfeld

12:15.486 --> 12:16.737
of the Brooklyn Criminal Court.

12:16.821 --> 12:17.947
- Mmm-hmm.
- You approached the bench

12:18.030 --> 12:19.407
and you said, "Your Honor,
I can win this case,

12:19.490 --> 12:21.117
"but only because
I can beat the public defender.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.910
"I'm no longer convinced that
the accused is guilty,

12:22.993 --> 12:24.036
"and I'm making a motion..."

12:24.120 --> 12:25.663
It was my case and my decision.

12:25.746 --> 12:29.125
Look, I get that you want a pro-death penalty
crime fighter making noise,

12:29.208 --> 12:31.293
but there's a difference
between reporting a story

12:31.377 --> 12:32.837
and advocating for a cop killer.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.005
- Alleged.
- Not alleged, convicted.

12:35.089 --> 12:37.174
- Do you see any reasonable doubt?
- I don't get a vote.

12:37.258 --> 12:40.136
- I'm just asking if you see any reasonable...
- Of course I do.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.272
Okay.

13:02.992 --> 13:05.244
- Wanna see some company history?
- What is it?

13:05.327 --> 13:07.621
Will at the anchor desk on 9/11.

13:07.705 --> 13:09.039
His first time in the chair.

13:09.123 --> 13:10.166
He picked a hell of a day.

13:10.249 --> 13:11.333
He didn't pick it.

13:11.417 --> 13:13.002
Dan Marsh was grounded in Chicago

13:13.085 --> 13:14.503
- and the other guy, Ed...
- Ed Wyatt.

13:14.587 --> 13:16.005
Wyatt couldn't cross a bridge.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.840
Julie Chen, Maria Herrera,

13:17.923 --> 13:19.800
Ryan Crosby... The bench was pretty thin.

13:19.884 --> 13:21.719
What was Will, the weekend anchor?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.929
- Legal correspondent.
- Shit.

13:24.013 --> 13:25.639
Here it is.

13:25.723 --> 13:27.766

with Charlie Skinner in his life until this day.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.619
that my roommate and I were
both into the same guy.

15:51.702 --> 15:54.622
Someone on the bus taped the whole
thing and posted it on YouTube.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.790

15:56.874 --> 15:59.126
- Shit.

Jim was on a <i>Sex and the City</i> tour bus?

16:01.086 --> 16:02.588
- Yeah.
- Why?

16:02.671 --> 16:04.131
I'm just lucky, I guess.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.468
- How many views does it have?
- 1,118 as of a half hour ago.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.720
- And Don's one of them?
- It's a Labor Day miracle.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.431
- Has Lisa seen it?
- No.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.559
I sent an e-mail trying to get it taken
down under their privacy policy,

16:15.643 --> 16:17.645
but I got an auto-response
saying it takes five days.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.522
Then I tried getting it
taken down under their copyright policy...

16:20.606 --> 16:22.733
The <i>Sex and the City</i> music and logo
can be heard and seen.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.902
- And?
- Five days.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.196
I can't think of anything else to try.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.531
- What about...
- Foursquare!

16:29.615 --> 16:31.408

"Another New Yorker Loses It."

16:36.580 --> 16:37.790
"Another New Yorker."

16:37.873 --> 16:39.917

19:58.699 --> 20:00.868
- Yeah.
- I can't believe I'm talking to you.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.578
- Well, like I said...
- I'm really curious.

20:02.661 --> 20:04.538
- Did you and your best friend make up?
- I'm sorry?

20:04.621 --> 20:07.666
You said, "I just spent my last $7
having a fight with my best friend."

20:07.749 --> 20:09.626
Yeah. We did. We did make up.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.378
And I said something in the video

20:11.461 --> 20:13.297
that would really hurt her if she saw it.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.923
That you like her boyfriend.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.720
- This is so weird.
- Yeah, it is.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.305
It's like I'm in this now.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.056
MAGGIE: Believe me,
you don't wanna be in it.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.433
And was the guy who jumped off the bus,

20:24.516 --> 20:25.893
was that the guy you were talking about?

20:25.976 --> 20:27.477
- It doesn't matter.
- Was it?

20:27.561 --> 20:29.187
I'd rather not get other people involved.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.148
You didn't know
he was on the bus when you shouted...

20:31.231 --> 20:33.233
- No. No, I didn't.
- What happened when he ran after you?

20:33.317 --> 20:34.902
It doesn't matter.
I just need the video taken down...

20:34.985 --> 20:36.904
- Are you guys together now?
- She said it doesn't matter, Erica.

20:36.987 --> 20:38.906
How far up her ass
do you need to crawl before you get...

20:38.989 --> 20:40.324
It's all right.

20:40.991 --> 20:42.075
That was really rude.

20:42.159 --> 20:44.036
She works a long day. We're all right.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.454
'Cause I don't respond to things like that.

20:45.537 --> 20:48.248
Me neither. I have a hunch we're a lot alike.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.541
You don't even know me.

20:49.625 --> 20:50.834
That's the thing,

20:50.918 --> 20:53.211
I feel like I do, from reading your blog.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.797
She writes this <i>Sex and the City</i> fan fiction,
except...

20:55.881 --> 20:57.591
- It's not fan fiction!
- That's what I was about to say.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.384
- It's not fan fiction.
- I take experiences from my life

20:59.468 --> 21:01.261
and I write them in the voice of the characters.

21:03.513 --> 21:04.514
Will you take down the video?

21:04.848 --> 21:07.351
This is the most views I've ever had,
and it links to my blog.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.227
I'm asking as a personal favor.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.480
- I don't know.
- How many Twitter followers do you have?

21:11.897 --> 21:13.106
I have over 300.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.650
I have more than that.

21:14.733 --> 21:16.610
I'm gonna give you something to tweet,
and I'll retweet it,

21:16.693 --> 21:18.528
and in exchange, you'll take down the video.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.322
- How many do you have?
- More than 300.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.907
How many?

21:21.990 --> 21:23.033
450,000.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.870
- You do not have 450,000.
- She does.

21:29.915 --> 21:30.958
Are you famous?

21:31.041 --> 21:33.043
She's very well-known
and respected in certain circles.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.127
What are you famous for?

21:34.211 --> 21:35.337
Making other people rich.

21:35.420 --> 21:36.588
Tweet this...

21:36.672 --> 21:38.674
"As China's reliance on oil increases,

21:38.757 --> 21:39.925

"to look toward Nigeria

21:43.345 --> 21:44.805
That doesn't really do anything for my blog.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.890

"A real-life Carrie Bradshaw."

Can I say Charlotte?

22:04.533 --> 22:05.742
You know what? You cannot say Charlotte.

22:05.826 --> 22:07.661
- You can say Charlotte.
- I like Charlotte.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.745
Seriously?

22:11.581 --> 22:13.583
Say Charlotte.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.469
- Cameron?
- Yeah?

22:24.553 --> 22:26.304
Any chance I can
get 30 minutes with the candidate today?

22:26.388 --> 22:27.848
No.

22:31.601 --> 22:34.104
Governor Romney continued
his campaign swing through the Granite State

22:34.187 --> 22:36.231
with a town hall-style event at the VFW Hall...

22:36.314 --> 22:38.233
For Atlantis Cable News, I'm Jim Harper

in Alexandria, New Hampshire.

22:40.152 --> 22:41.695
...in Sutton, New Hampshire...

22:41.778 --> 22:45.490
For Atlantis Cable News, I'm Jim Harper
with the Romney campaign in Gilbert.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.617
I was hoping you'd run a name
through your VA database for me.

22:47.909 --> 22:50.162
Gunnery Sergeant Eric Sweeney.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.955
- GARY: Maggie.
- Yeah, it's a very common name.

22:52.039 --> 22:54.875
I'll take anyone
who was deployed in the last 10 years.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.002
Satellite Sentinel Project
just released a report

22:57.085 --> 22:58.879
that they have evidence
that the Sudanese government

22:58.962 --> 23:00.964
is building mass civilian graves
in the Nuba Mountains.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.215
Can I get the report?

23:02.299 --> 23:03.759
- The whole thing?
- The whole thing.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.093
CAMERON: 8:30 we start
with a business roundtable

23:05.177 --> 23:06.386
where the Governor will be talking about

23:06.470 --> 23:08.388
how to fix Obama's stalled economy.

23:08.472 --> 23:11.683
Then we go to Claremont
for an 11:00 a.m. Freedom Forum

23:11.767 --> 23:14.478
where he'll talk about
Obama's stalled economy and how to fix it.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.313
Lunch is turkey sandwiches.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.398
And then at 3:00 p.m., town hall meeting

23:18.482 --> 23:20.901
where Governor Romney
will be taking questions from voters

23:20.984 --> 23:22.903
about how he's gonna fix the economy.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.237
And Jim has a question already.

23:24.321 --> 23:26.031
Yes. How's the Governor
gonna fix the economy?

23:26.114 --> 23:27.574
CAMERON: He will be talking
about that today.

23:27.657 --> 23:28.742
Any chance I can get 30 minutes?

23:28.825 --> 23:30.243
No. But keep asking.

23:30.327 --> 23:31.495
I will.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.556
A Christian group
armed with knives, machetes and guns

23:51.640 --> 23:53.767

Lieutenant Riley, my name is Jerry Dantana.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.438
I'm with ACN, and I'm trying to track down

23:58.522 --> 24:00.607
a retired Marine gunnery sergeant

24:00.690 --> 24:02.818
named Eric Sweeney, likely Special Ops.

24:02.901 --> 24:03.902
Eric Sweeney?

24:04.528 --> 24:06.446
They were armed
with knives, machetes and bows

24:06.530 --> 24:08.657
and attacked
Muslims praying during Ramadan.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.283
<i>Twenty-one people are dead.</i>

24:10.367 --> 24:11.660
Did any of them live here?

24:12.619 --> 24:13.620
No.

24:13.703 --> 24:16.123
In an historic address
to a joint session of Congress,

24:16.206 --> 24:19.543
<i>the President implored lawmakers</i>
<i>to pass the American Jobs Act.</i>

24:19.626 --> 24:22.629
The President used the phrase,
"Pass this jobs bill"

18 times during his address.

24:25.006 --> 24:27.551

She says I need to be more specific

24:53.910 --> 24:55.662

something to do with us.

24:55.954 --> 24:58.373
<i>- Give me advice.</i>
- Be specific and have it have

24:58.456 --> 25:00.542

- Okay.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.590

25:06.673 --> 25:08.216
- Jim?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

25:08.300 --> 25:10.260
I just want things

I'm normal.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.388
<i>It doesn't sound like it.</i>

25:13.471 --> 25:15.849

what the hell you're doing in New Hampshire

25:15.932 --> 25:17.184
when you're a senior producer.

25:17.267 --> 25:18.935
I'm waiting for Ben Furusho's ankle to heal.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.813

- Hey, you know what? Look who's talking.

25:23.273 --> 25:24.274
All right.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.484

25:44.169 --> 25:45.795
Yeah.

25:46.296 --> 25:47.297
Why don't you?

25:47.380 --> 25:48.965
I didn't like normal.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.346
She's someone in my newsroom.

25:54.429 --> 25:55.889

26:08.985 --> 26:10.070
Yeah.

26:11.696 --> 26:15.617
Can you think of anything about Africa
that's relevant to Americans?

26:15.700 --> 26:17.911
It's the next place
US soldiers are gonna go to die.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.689
The subject, audience retention.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.063
Mac would never allow it.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.357
Don would never allow it
if he were in the room.

29:34.441 --> 29:36.693
- Charlie.
- Don's back.

29:36.776 --> 29:37.861
I've got an off-the-record source

29:37.944 --> 29:39.112
and no second confirmation

29:39.195 --> 29:41.281
that there's been outside
lobbying on the Georgia Parole Board.

29:41.364 --> 29:44.534
- Real lobbyists or...
- Yeah, lobbyists. Professional lobbyists.

29:44.617 --> 29:47.120
That's not illegal for the parole board,
just for the lobbyists.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.455
- Which way?
- Against.

29:48.538 --> 29:50.290

29:51.791 --> 29:52.834

29:52.917 --> 29:54.085
How good's the source?

29:54.169 --> 29:56.713
- It's...
- Are they saying money changed hands?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.548
No, just they made phone calls.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.175
The pope's made phone calls for this.

30:00.258 --> 30:01.259
Well, my swing vote...

30:01.342 --> 30:03.011
The guy you think is the swing vote.

30:03.094 --> 30:04.929
Know is the swing vote,

30:05.013 --> 30:06.973
didn't listen to the pope,
he listened to the lobbyists.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.350
So I'd like to go over to dayside
and have them report

30:09.434 --> 30:11.436
- that there's been a development in the story.
- CHARLIE: No way.

30:11.519 --> 30:12.479
Get someone on the record,

30:12.562 --> 30:14.272
get confirmation, and we'll...

30:14.355 --> 30:15.940
We'll keep trying, but in the meantime,

30:16.024 --> 30:17.442
- I want to break in.
- Go with the story that...

30:17.525 --> 30:19.152
You don't have the story to break in with.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.945
- The clock is ticking.
- CHARLIE: Same rule.

30:21.029 --> 30:23.865
Call him. Say you've heard a report
and you want confirmation.

30:23.948 --> 30:26.242
When he denies it,
then I really won't be able to run it.

30:26.326 --> 30:27.869
You can't run it now.

30:27.952 --> 30:30.205
Why don't I just call him and tell him...

30:30.288 --> 30:31.289
I can just call him.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.500
I could call him and say, "I know your name.

30:33.583 --> 30:37.504
"I know your name, and if Troy Davis dies,
I'm reporting that you were the swing vote.

30:37.587 --> 30:39.839
"I'm reporting your name, your address,

30:39.923 --> 30:43.009
"and I'm gonna throw a Google Earth image
of your house up on the screen

30:43.092 --> 30:46.221
"so we have a record of what it looked like
before it was set on fire."

30:50.141 --> 30:52.685
You could put a picture
of his kids up on the screen,

30:52.769 --> 30:54.270
say where they go to school.

30:58.691 --> 31:03.029
Seven of nine witnesses,
and one of the two is a suspect.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.492
What could the lobbyist have said
to the parole board member

31:07.575 --> 31:10.537
that could possibly have been better
than what the pope said?

31:14.916 --> 31:17.043
JIM: Do you have anyone
inside the police unions?

31:36.813 --> 31:38.982
Yeah. No. Cool.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.317

Nothing, I was...

32:11.514 --> 32:13.308
I heard something was going
on with the parole board.

32:15.351 --> 32:16.936
I have a source saying
the swing vote was lobbied,

32:17.020 --> 32:17.979
and it's 3-2 against.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.397
It's against the law for lobbyists...

32:19.480 --> 32:20.481
I know it is.

32:22.650 --> 32:24.110
It's not like I'm indifferent.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.195
- It never occurred to me that you were.
- All right.

32:26.696 --> 32:27.697
I can give you cover.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.450
If you're worried about
coming out for a guy accused...

32:30.533 --> 32:31.659
I don't need cover.

32:35.997 --> 32:38.249
One of the witnesses
said Davis confessed to him in jail.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.460
- Kevin McQueen.
- Then McQueen said he made it all up.

32:40.543 --> 32:42.295
The court said
the recantation didn't mean much

32:42.378 --> 32:44.005
because McQueen was so obviously lying

32:44.088 --> 32:45.506
that the jurors
couldn't have attached much weight

32:45.590 --> 32:46.591
to his testimony in the first place.

32:46.674 --> 32:49.010
It was clear that he was lying,
so it didn't matter that he was lying?

32:49.093 --> 32:51.971
That was the ruling of the US Court
for the Southern District of Georgia, yeah.

32:52.055 --> 32:53.640
The recanting witness
who said he was coerced?

32:53.723 --> 32:56.726
Jeffrey Sapp. The court said his testimony
wasn't damaging enough to Davis,

32:56.809 --> 32:57.852
that if he'd really been coerced, his...

32:57.935 --> 32:59.896
Testimony would have been more damaging.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.357
Another recanting witness said
she saw the alternate suspect

33:02.440 --> 33:03.650
- pull the trigger.
- Harriet Murray.

33:03.733 --> 33:04.984
Why didn't she testify at the hearing?

33:05.068 --> 33:07.195
She's dead.

33:07.278 --> 33:08.488
The court won't give any weight to her claim.

33:08.571 --> 33:09.864
That's 'cause she wasn't cross-examined.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.908
- When did the burden shift?
- When he was convicted.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.660
- He shot a police officer.
- No, he didn't.

33:13.743 --> 33:15.495
The jury said he did.
The district court said he did.

34:57.096 --> 34:59.348

so she reposted it.

- Oh, Jesus Christ.

- Don't misunderstand, I was moved

was to impress upon me

35:07.648 --> 35:08.649

But Maggie just can't get the breaks.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.236
- That wasn't what...
- A minute ago, I was kind of furious.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.113
But now that
I know you went all the way to Queens

35:14.197 --> 35:16.824

well, I just can't stay mad at you.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.967
Fuck Don, fuck Lisa.

35:35.426 --> 35:37.637
We hear Jim's voice, and then
he jumps off the bus and chases you.

35:37.720 --> 35:38.763
- What happened next?
- It doesn't matter.

35:38.846 --> 35:39.847
- The whole thing...
- It matters to me.

35:40.389 --> 35:43.309
- The whole thing...
- What happened next?

35:43.392 --> 35:45.478
He came after me and we talked.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.063
What else did you do?

35:48.773 --> 35:50.691

35:52.318 --> 35:54.612
- We kissed.
- Yeah.

35:54.695 --> 35:56.781
And then I went back to Don,
and Jim went back to you.

35:56.864 --> 35:59.158
And the last few weeks, when I'd say
Jim sounded weird on the phone,

35:59.242 --> 36:01.702
you said it was "all in my head"
and I should "stop acting crazy."

36:01.786 --> 36:04.121
- I was wrong.
- Let's not rush to judgment.

36:05.706 --> 36:07.542
Why did Jim go to New Hampshire?

36:07.625 --> 36:10.127
To cover for an embed who broke his ankle.
That's legitimate.

36:10.211 --> 36:13.005
Is it common for someone
with Jim's job to take that assignment?

36:13.089 --> 36:14.507
No.

36:14.590 --> 36:17.426
He left 'cause
he didn't want to be around Don and me.

36:18.594 --> 36:20.054
- Last question.
- Lise...

36:20.137 --> 36:21.305
Why did you fix me up with Jim?

36:21.389 --> 36:22.849
I didn't. Don did.

36:22.932 --> 36:24.767
And in fairness,
I'd been telling you about my feelings...

36:24.851 --> 36:27.061
"In fairness"?
In fairness, you then turned into eHarmony

36:27.144 --> 36:29.063
and told me over and over
that you didn't have feelings.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.356
- Yeah.
- I mean, after all the breaking up

36:30.439 --> 36:33.192
and getting back together,
and you're telling me over a year of this,

36:33.276 --> 36:35.152
you didn't want him to pick you,

36:35.236 --> 36:37.822
you wanted him to pick you instead of me.

- Hold it right there.
- Right?

36:41.158 --> 36:43.119
- A little?
- You can't possibly think that.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.662
No, I can. You're seeing me do it right now.

36:44.996 --> 36:47.957
Okay, can we back up? Because one of us
is gonna say something we can't walk back.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.667
I think it's gonna be me. What do you think?

36:49.750 --> 36:51.711

for Jim when I did.

36:56.924 --> 36:57.967

36:58.050 --> 36:59.886
You parked him with me
because you thought that was safe.

36:59.969 --> 37:01.345
- No...
- Because Jim would never get serious

39:25.114 --> 39:27.491
And if there's anyone
who wants this to be a story, it's me,

39:27.575 --> 39:30.202
but this is just a dwindling local protest

39:30.286 --> 39:32.747
with a rambling list of unfocused demands

39:32.830 --> 39:36.000
that is more rambling and less focused than
when I met you four weeks ago.

39:36.083 --> 39:38.419
- Something's going on up there.
- Yeah, something's going on.

39:38.502 --> 39:42.256
CROWD: (CHANTING)
All day, all week, occupying Wall Street.

39:42.339 --> 39:44.216
All day, all week...

39:44.300 --> 39:47.720
- (ARGUING)
- CHARLIE: Hang on. Mac?

39:47.803 --> 39:49.722
We publicly demand the administration

39:49.805 --> 39:51.515
release the memorandum
authorizing the killing.

39:51.599 --> 39:52.725
By we, you mean me.

39:52.808 --> 39:55.186
He's got Fifth and Sixth
Amendment protection.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.772
Look, I'm trying real hard to care that
al-Awlaki is dead, but I don't.

39:57.855 --> 39:59.940
I don't care that he's dead.
I care that we killed him.

40:00.024 --> 40:02.693
Without a trial or anything
resembling due process.

40:02.777 --> 40:04.987
You can't switch teams,
declare your intention

40:05.071 --> 40:06.906
to kill as many Americans as possible

40:06.989 --> 40:08.908
and not expect to be treated
as an enemy of the state.

40:08.991 --> 40:11.577
And you can't be found
to be an enemy of the state without a trial.

40:11.660 --> 40:15.206
John Dillinger said the problem
with living outside the law

40:15.289 --> 40:16.916
is that you no longer have the protection of it.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.417
That doesn't sound like Dillinger.

40:18.501 --> 40:19.919
Yeah, it may have been someone else.

40:20.002 --> 40:22.797
Federal agents tried to arrest Dillinger
coming out of a movie theater.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.175
And when he pulled a gun, they shot him.
They didn't hit the theater with a rocket.

40:26.258 --> 40:29.053
al-Awlaki was the head of AQAP.
He doesn't get read Miranda.

40:29.136 --> 40:31.180
- I don't give a shit what his passport says.
- You don't?

40:31.263 --> 40:34.058
And you know all those times the two of you
ask me why I'm a Republican,

40:34.141 --> 40:35.935
as if that's something
that needs an explanation?

40:36.018 --> 40:37.269
I don't know what the hell you're on about.

40:37.353 --> 40:39.897
I never heard either of you
ask anyone why they're a Democrat.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.148
Well, it's right here.

40:41.232 --> 40:43.651
The purposeful suspension
of common sense.

40:43.734 --> 40:46.237
Treason is a crime.
You have to be found guilty of it before...

40:46.320 --> 40:48.489
The White House Counsel. The DOJ.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.282
There is a legal analysis.

40:50.366 --> 40:52.451
There's a memorandum
that allows the President to do this.

40:52.535 --> 40:54.537
Great. Can we see it?

40:54.620 --> 40:57.123
Does it have a name or is that secret, too?

40:57.206 --> 40:58.624
What's our role here, guys?

40:58.707 --> 41:00.376
Demand the memorandum be made public.

41:00.459 --> 41:02.128
You think it's gonna make our lives easier

41:02.211 --> 41:05.131
if I appear to be defending a leader
of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula?

41:05.214 --> 41:07.466
Who cares about our lives being easier?

41:07.550 --> 41:09.510
I do! And you do, too,

41:09.593 --> 41:12.221
or there wouldn't be tweets scrolling
through Elliot's show tonight.

41:12.304 --> 41:13.305
Listen to me.

41:13.389 --> 41:15.766
When I took you off the anniversary coverage,

41:15.850 --> 41:17.685
I wasn't telling you to change your clothes.

41:17.768 --> 41:21.313
It was about that particular day
and this particular moment.

41:21.397 --> 41:23.774
- They didn't know.
- What?

41:23.858 --> 41:26.318
We told the staff he took himself
off the anniversary.

41:26.402 --> 41:28.487
Did anybody believe you?

41:28.571 --> 41:29.655
Everybody.

41:29.738 --> 41:30.948
- No.
- Nobody.

41:31.782 --> 41:33.993
TAMARA: Excuse me.
CHARLIE: Give us just a second.

41:34.076 --> 41:36.245
Neal was arrested.
He's calling from the First Precinct.

41:37.913 --> 41:41.500
- Put him on speaker, Maggie.
- You're on speaker.

41:41.584 --> 41:42.668
What happened, Neal?

41:42.751 --> 41:45.171
<i>I went to an Occupy rally.</i>
<i>I did it on my lunch hour.</i>

41:45.254 --> 41:47.673
<i>The police started arresting</i>
<i>people who were wearing masks.</i>

41:47.756 --> 41:51.010
<i>There's a law in the books</i>
<i>in New York that dates back to 1845.</i>

41:51.093 --> 41:53.012
<i>Groups of people can't wear masks in public.</i>

41:53.095 --> 41:54.597
- Were you wearing a mask?
<i>- No.</i>

41:54.680 --> 41:56.432
Did you identify yourself as a reporter?

41:56.515 --> 41:58.058
<i>I did and I got some good footage</i>

41:58.142 --> 42:00.186

<i>and destroyed my phone.</i>

42:00.269 --> 42:01.270
Are you kidding me?

42:01.353 --> 42:02.521
He still got the footage.

42:02.605 --> 42:05.357
- How?
<i>- Maggie, open up Ustream.</i>

42:05.441 --> 42:07.151
SHELLY: <i>Shout out your name</i>
<i>if you're getting arrested.</i>

<i>the video back to my computer.</i>

42:11.989 --> 42:13.949

Good job, man.

42:17.119 --> 42:19.038
- I'm gonna come bail you out.
- I'm doing it.

42:19.121 --> 42:22.041
- No.
- Send the film to my phone.

42:30.174 --> 42:31.425
- Can I help you?
- You've got a dis con here

42:31.508 --> 42:32.593
named Neal Sampat.

42:32.676 --> 42:34.386
I need you to void the arrest.

42:34.470 --> 42:36.597
- You his lawyer?
- Yes.

42:37.389 --> 42:39.141
- I'm sorry, but aren't you...
- Yes.

42:39.225 --> 42:41.644
- Mr. Sampat works for me.
- Okay, well, Mr...

42:41.727 --> 42:44.021
It's gonna end in an ROR
or an ACD anyway, so...

42:44.104 --> 42:46.023
As I understand it,
he was creating a hazardous

42:46.106 --> 42:48.859
or physically offensive condition
by an act which serves no purpose.

42:48.943 --> 42:52.404
You're quoting 240-2-7,
and it's "no legitimate purpose."

42:52.488 --> 42:53.656
He was reporting on a protest.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.324
That's a legitimate purpose.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.076
- Here's how this works.
- I know how it works.

42:57.159 --> 42:59.578
Do you know the arresting officer?
Is he a friend of yours?

42:59.662 --> 43:00.996
- He is.
- Has he ever been the subject

43:01.080 --> 43:02.456
of a 1983 action?

43:02.539 --> 43:04.541
If you're not sure, then he hasn't,

43:04.625 --> 43:06.543
because it's a charge for civil rights violations

43:06.627 --> 43:10.339
that never doesn't end with badges
and service revolvers being tossed on desks.

43:10.422 --> 43:12.258
I'm sure it was a by-the-book arrest.

43:12.341 --> 43:14.385
Anwar al-Awlaki was killed today.

43:14.468 --> 43:17.054
It wasn't an accident.
There was no warrant, no arrest,

43:17.137 --> 43:19.890
no arraignment, no judge,
no jury and no appeal.

43:21.725 --> 43:23.269
- How do you spell...
- Not here.

43:23.352 --> 43:25.604
A US citizen was targeted.

43:25.688 --> 43:28.941
Another's on death row for the crime
of not being able to afford a good lawyer.

43:29.024 --> 43:32.861
And a bunch more have been
locked up for wearing Halloween masks.

43:32.945 --> 43:37.491
So obviously what I'm doing
is dealing with the easiest one.

44:54.568 --> 44:57.196
I can tell you more than three differences.
I was shot at by both of them.
