00:51.009 --> 00:52.218
-[in English] Jesus.
-It's me.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.219
[groans]

00:53.303 --> 00:55.597
Gonna give me a heart attack
one of these days.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.307
[Kiki groans]

00:57.390 --> 00:58.683
Why didn't you call?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.936
-[Kiki] What, like you couldn't sleep?
-I'm serious.

01:02.687 --> 01:06.024
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I should've called.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.903
[grunts]

01:12.405 --> 01:13.782
Who'd you piss off today?

01:16.284 --> 01:18.411
You wouldn't believe the day I just had.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.562
[sighs]

01:54.614 --> 01:56.491
[phone rings]

02:02.247 --> 02:03.748
[in English] Yeah. This is Jaime.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.333
Jaime, hey.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.919
It's-- It's Mika. Um...

02:09.129 --> 02:11.798
I'm sorry to wake you.
I know-- I know it's late.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.259
Mika? What's wrong?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.427
Have you heard from Kiki at all?

02:17.303 --> 02:21.850
I know you probably have him working late.
It's just I... [sighs]

02:21.933 --> 02:23.768
...hate when he forgets to check in.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.603
He's not with you?

02:27.897 --> 02:29.816
Hasn't been home since this morning.

02:30.525 --> 02:34.112
He mention anywhere he was headed?
After lunch?

02:38.032 --> 02:39.617
He never made it to lunch.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.874
[Rodrigo Amarante's "Tuyo" playing]

04:13.920 --> 04:16.381
[Félix in Spanish]
This is going to get uncomfortable.

04:16.881 --> 04:17.966
[sighs]

04:18.800 --> 04:23.221
We stick together until the government's
gotten what they need.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.931
You think it's that simple?

04:26.266 --> 04:29.936
You have any idea
what the Americans will do?

04:30.019 --> 04:31.145
Yeah, Neto.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.941
But... we focus on what's ahead,
not waste time with what's done.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.484
You realize what you've done?

04:37.735 --> 04:40.071
What is at risk for you?

04:41.155 --> 04:44.575
Don't you fucking understand
I did it to protect us?

04:45.493 --> 04:48.913
To take care of us because nobody
is doing anything about the American--

04:48.997 --> 04:51.124
That fucking American doesn't know shit!

04:51.749 --> 04:53.167
Nothing!

04:53.793 --> 04:57.630
With the money we were making,
we'd have planted you ten more fields!

04:58.673 --> 04:59.757
Neto...

05:00.758 --> 05:02.844
we pay the cops.

05:03.803 --> 05:08.683
We pay the fucking government who has him.
What can the Americans do?

05:08.766 --> 05:12.186
Stupid and cocky.

05:12.979 --> 05:16.482
Don't know why nobody's
put a bullet in you.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.984
Are you going to do it?

05:18.234 --> 05:20.945
Sit down, Rafael! Enough, Neto. Enough.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.613
Sit down!

05:29.370 --> 05:32.248
Don't you understand I did this for us?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.501
-[Rafa] That I did it to protect us?
-I'm the one talking, asshole!

05:36.753 --> 05:38.796
[Félix] They will turn you in, Rafa.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.382
As soon as this shit is done.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.178
They will give you
to the Americans as a gift. Got it?

05:47.305 --> 05:48.765
They used you, idiot.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.772
-What do I do?
-You disappear.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.232
For a long time.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.489
And you?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.701
We manage the business.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.330
The only thing that keeps us alive.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.004
I leave and then what?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.590
What happens next?

06:33.893 --> 06:37.397
[man in Spanish] I'm going to name
some people in the government...

06:38.398 --> 06:41.067
and I want to know
what you know about them.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.905
What about... [beep]?

06:48.032 --> 06:50.326
Was his name on the wire?

06:50.493 --> 06:51.619
No.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.330
-[electricity buzzes]
-[screams]

06:56.457 --> 06:59.627
[grunting]

06:59.710 --> 07:01.045
[panting]

07:01.129 --> 07:02.171
[man] Look at me.

07:06.801 --> 07:10.805
You don't look at me when I ask...
I'll make this hurt more.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.391
Look at me!

07:18.312 --> 07:20.606
If you talk, this all goes away.

07:23.484 --> 07:24.902
I don't know anything.

08:10.531 --> 08:13.034
[Jaime in English] No one's heard
from Kiki since yesterday, sir,

08:13.117 --> 08:13.951
uh, just after noon.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.704
He left to meet his wife
and no one's seen him since.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.956
[Ed] So he didn't meet his wife.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.212
Maybe there's someone else?
Might suggest why he's not answering.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.840
You get the direction I'm pointing?

08:27.924 --> 08:30.760
No, there's no girlfriend, sir.
There's no one else he'd be meeting.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.429
Sir, we're going on 18 hours now.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.640
I'm aware of how a clock works, Jaime.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.685
-What's his partner say?
-His partner, sir?

08:39.769 --> 08:42.855
Yeah, Jaime, his partner.
Might know where he'd be.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.565
I'm thinking a bar maybe.

08:44.649 --> 08:49.445
Butch Sears rotated home two weeks ago.
No new agents have been sent down since.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.030
There's no one else here.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.663
Look, let's not panic. Okay?

08:59.455 --> 09:01.290
You guys are coming off a big win.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.459
Been down here a while.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.296
Camarena's probably
just blowing off some steam.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.007
It's time to consider
that Kiki's been taken.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.270
[Mika] Félix Gallardo.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.940
[in English] It's who has him, isn't it?

09:28.568 --> 09:32.238
Well, we...
I mean, we don't know that for sure.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.201
Have you called the hospital?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.622
-Has someone called the morgue?
-Mika, you can't start thinking--

09:41.706 --> 09:43.541
'Cause that's where else
he'd be, isn't it?

09:47.503 --> 09:49.088
Look, Suzy called the morgue.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.632
We checked with the hospitals.
He ain't at either.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.606
Me and Kiki talked about this.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.612
You know,
if one day he wouldn't come home.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.531
So don't lie to me, Jaime.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.993
He's my husband.
I deserve to know the truth. Everything.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.747
That's all I know. You have my word.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.459
So what do we do?

10:29.503 --> 10:30.630
[sighs]

10:31.922 --> 10:33.549
You know he's not dead.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.595
Because if they wanted to kill him,
they would've done it already.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.474
And if they didn't call for a ransom,
it means they don't want money.

10:42.391 --> 10:45.936
They want something from him.
So he's only good to them alive.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.525
God damn, Mika, I guess you two
really have talked about this.

10:51.609 --> 10:56.405
Every second counts, Jaime.
So get out there and find Kiki.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.328
[narrator in English]
Time is crucial in a kidnapping.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.705
The sooner action's taken,

11:04.789 --> 11:07.166
the better your chances
of things working out...

11:08.084 --> 11:10.252
and everybody coming home in one piece.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.798
They put that in the handbook nowadays.

11:14.590 --> 11:19.887
But on February 8, 1985...
nobody knew shit.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.306
So what do you do?

11:23.599 --> 11:24.975
You fucking scramble.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.104
Start spreading the word.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.566
Of course, the trick of it was...
getting the Mex-Feds to act.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.319
What were they planning to do?

11:36.654 --> 11:37.947
As it turns out...

11:39.573 --> 11:40.574
jack shit.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.827
[in Spanish] My men are all occupied.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.206
Commander, not sure you're understanding--

11:47.289 --> 11:50.459
You know we lost one of ours in Colima.

11:50.876 --> 11:54.672
Never seems to bother you
when one of my men goes down.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.300
But I suppose yours are more important.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.722
Go to the state police.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.682
Maybe they can help you.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.706
[noise from TV]

12:47.808 --> 12:49.518
[man in Spanish]
What do you want us to do?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.811
Get out there!

12:50.895 --> 12:54.023
Fucking catch one of these guys!

12:54.356 --> 12:56.233
"Catch one"? Just like that?

12:56.901 --> 12:59.820
They've taken one of my men,
don't you understand?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.864
[in English]
You're yelling at the wrong guy.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.076
Comandante, I need your help.

13:07.369 --> 13:10.372
State police can't get involved
until an attorney signs off.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.584
-Bullshit! Since when?
-Since always, Jaime.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.544
Do you want my help?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.172
-Find an attorney to sign off.
-Sir, I--

13:18.255 --> 13:21.175
Jaime, I suggest you get moving.

13:23.969 --> 13:24.970
Fuck!

13:26.180 --> 13:28.599
[narrator] A federal attorney
in a place like Guadalajara

13:28.682 --> 13:29.809
was easy to find.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.104
But one willing
to put their ass on the line?

13:34.688 --> 13:36.148
[in Spanish] Don't bother me again.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.150
[narrator in English]
A slightly tougher ask.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.279
Not to say there weren't honest people,
those willing to help.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.156
We just had to find them.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.492
[in Spanish] Attorney Maldujano?
It's Suzy from the DEA.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.370
You think you can help me with a warrant?

13:50.162 --> 13:53.249
[in English] Yes, this is Suzy from
the DEA. I wanted to know if you have--

13:55.459 --> 13:57.711
[in Spanish] Attorney, are you available
to sign an order?

13:59.421 --> 14:00.548
Okay, thank you.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.884
-[narrator in English] That can take time.
-[elevator dings]

14:04.301 --> 14:05.553
[in Spanish] Mr. Lawyer.

14:06.053 --> 14:06.929
Sir.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.515
My name is Jaime Kuykendall.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.226
I'm with the DEA here in Guadalajara.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.562
[elevator dings]

14:16.272 --> 14:19.400
[narrator in English] Guess the wheels
of bureaucracy move at their own speed.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.443
[Jaime in Spanish] Commander!

14:23.153 --> 14:24.071
Where is Cortez?

14:24.154 --> 14:25.322
[in English] What's going on?

14:25.406 --> 14:27.032
I'm looking for Cortez.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.369
Well, he's not here.
Can I help you with something?

14:32.997 --> 14:34.248
Yeah. Uh...

14:34.498 --> 14:35.666
[narrator] Frustrating?

14:36.125 --> 14:39.670
Well, imagine your life
was hanging in the balance

14:39.753 --> 14:44.216
and the guys supposed to rescue you
are waiting in line at the fucking DMV.

14:45.092 --> 14:48.846
[comandante in English] I don't see
a missing persons complaint in this file.

14:48.929 --> 14:52.641
Needs to be filed with the MFJP
before his signature can be processed.

14:53.976 --> 14:57.646
No. They're the ones that sent me,
said you guys would help.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.774
[comandante] Well, not without that form.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.444
[Jaime] Then fucking call them!

15:03.527 --> 15:06.864
Ask them for the goddamn form!
Ask them to fax it right now!

15:08.407 --> 15:09.950
I'm afraid it's too late.

15:10.826 --> 15:11.994
Try back tomorrow.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.225
[narrator] But it can take
the unexpected, a crisis,

15:35.309 --> 15:36.769
to pull people together.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.858
That's sure as hell true of the DEA.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.361
[indistinct chatter]

15:45.444 --> 15:47.237
Where do we get started, Chief?

15:47.905 --> 15:50.199
God damn, it's good seeing your ugly face.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.704
[narrator] Suits in Washington
sent every agent that could make the trip.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.667
Twenty men in the first 24 hours.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.005
Even came bearing gifts.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.425
State-of-the-art surveillance equipment.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.221
Shit you'd only see in the movies.

16:13.222 --> 16:17.726
[man in Spanish] Hey, man, tell them
to be careful with the shipment.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.937
[narrator]
These assholes had been talking.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.064
Now, DEA was listening.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.361
[El Azul in Spanish]
The Americans have sent reinforcements.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.325
And you'll hold them off, right?

16:37.454 --> 16:38.706
Where's Rafa?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.418
Our friends may ask.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.795
Sit down, Azul.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.386
The situation's been handled.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.599
Don't think I've forgotten
the role you played.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.643
I just follow orders.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.146
Well, here are your orders...

17:03.022 --> 17:04.898
Rafa isn't to be touched.

17:05.524 --> 17:09.361
And I'm getting tired of reminding you
who you work for.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.160
[Félix] We're done here.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.830
[Mika in English] So today was a loss.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.041
We're fighting the system.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.251
And he's running out of time.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.212
We're going to keep pressing.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.758
There are people who do care.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.843
All these other agents who came from--

17:32.926 --> 17:35.637
They'll be handcuffed by the system,
exact same as you.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.223
Tell me I'm wrong.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.021
[sighs]

17:49.568 --> 17:51.070
Ed Heath, tell me about him.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.990
He should be here. Why isn't he?

17:55.449 --> 18:00.579
He's in Mexico City. He's--
I imagine he's doing the best he can.

18:01.205 --> 18:05.167
God, he's an asshole, Mika.
He's a fucking asshole.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.045
So, who knows?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.256
[Jaime sighs]

18:13.717 --> 18:15.886
I like you better when you're honest.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.310
I'm trying.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.190
Let me talk to Heath.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.610
You say he's an asshole.
I have some experience.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.282
Yeah.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.381
Fredo?

18:53.632 --> 18:54.633
Kiki?

19:02.266 --> 19:03.392
[Kiki grunts]

19:06.145 --> 19:09.273
[in English] They keep asking me things.
I don't know the answers.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.317
I'm just a pilot.
What do they think I know?

19:12.860 --> 19:16.321
You--
You just have to tell them the truth.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.408
I don't know anything.

19:20.033 --> 19:23.203
Okay. Well, then that's what you say.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.915
Whatever they want...

19:28.792 --> 19:30.377
whatever they're looking for...

19:35.048 --> 19:36.258
you don't know anything.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.344
So you can't tell them anything.

19:40.512 --> 19:46.351
Hey... if you lie to them
and you tell them what they want to hear

19:48.020 --> 19:51.315
and they find out that you're lying, it--

19:52.482 --> 19:53.609
[grunts]

19:59.489 --> 20:02.117
[Kiki grunting]

20:05.621 --> 20:07.497
If they find out that you're lying...

20:08.457 --> 20:10.292
they'll question everything you say.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.711
And then it won't stop.

20:14.004 --> 20:14.880
Okay?

20:16.673 --> 20:18.592
[man in Spanish]
What have they told you?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.469
They give you any information?

20:22.930 --> 20:25.057
Says his neighbor put up the wire.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.310
Was discovered before they got anything.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.438
Neither of them knows shit.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.024
I need names.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.318
I need names right now.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.196
[snaps fingers]

20:39.279 --> 20:40.697
Get back to work.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.412
[in English] Oh, shit.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.879
I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.927
[Ed in English] I admire your resolve.

21:02.844 --> 21:07.099
I'm sorry we have to meet
under these, uh... circumstances.

21:07.599 --> 21:11.144
[Mika] It's okay, you can say it.
Knowing my husband might die.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.314
I don't know that to be true.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.650
How much do you know?

21:17.359 --> 21:19.695
[Mika] Do you know
what these agents have been facing?

21:20.153 --> 21:22.114
The lack of support they've gotten?

21:24.908 --> 21:25.909
[Ed] Mika...

21:29.705 --> 21:31.164
What would you like me to do?

21:32.749 --> 21:36.878
For you to start listening
to the agents who work here.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.548
The ones who know how this works.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.883
Give them what they need.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.344
Because right now, Ed,

21:44.428 --> 21:47.556
it seems like they're the only ones
fighting to bring Kiki home.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.020
I've been in this country
for ten years, Mika.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.939
And while I understand your frustration,

21:56.523 --> 21:58.775
I assure you I know very well
how this works.

21:59.484 --> 22:04.239
With all due respect to Jaime here,
it works in Mexico City.

22:05.240 --> 22:09.202
And that is where I have been,
with the Attorney General of this country.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.874
I'm doing everything I can
to get us the support that we need.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.882
Armando Pavón.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.636
He's a member of the Security
Directorate's personal detail.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.306
And he'll be leading the investigation.

22:30.307 --> 22:33.143
And I've been assured
there is no one more capable.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.689
This is the best man for the job.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.865
I appreciate the support, Ed.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.911
But, um, I'm gonna be honest...

22:52.204 --> 22:54.039
I haven't heard much about this Pavón.

22:54.623 --> 22:58.377
And maybe that's okay,
you not knowing everything, Jaime.

22:59.252 --> 23:01.421
Look, Pavón comes at my recommendation.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.674
He's in charge, so fall in line.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.637
[sighs] And stop sharing intel
with the wife, huh?

23:09.429 --> 23:11.890
I'd say she's a little... emotional.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.059
No, sir. No.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.104
She's pissed.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.819
[car engine starts]

23:31.201 --> 23:33.370
-[hymnal music playing]
-[Sofia in Spanish] I hate you.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.497
You're so dramatic.

23:36.039 --> 23:40.001
Maybe you should listen to this music.
You could use more Christ in your life.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.338
-We're literally driving to church, Mom.
-Uh-huh.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.550
I like this music.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.010
-They're going to play it there.
-[music stops]

23:49.094 --> 23:50.971
-Here too.
-[music restarts]

23:51.596 --> 23:52.639
[Sofia groans]

23:57.018 --> 23:58.228
[sighs]

23:58.937 --> 24:00.647
[tires squeal]

24:07.070 --> 24:10.323
[Hombres G's
"Devuélveme a mi chica" playing]

24:10.407 --> 24:12.701
-[Sofia] Rafa?
-[Violeta] No! No! No!

24:12.784 --> 24:14.995
[Violeta panting] No!

24:15.078 --> 24:17.581
No! No! No!

24:17.664 --> 24:19.833
-Please, no!
-I've missed you.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.042
Missed you too.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.128
I have to go away for a while.
Come with me.

24:24.796 --> 24:25.839
Yes.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.593
No, Sofia! Sofia!

24:31.803 --> 24:33.346
To the end of the Earth.

24:49.070 --> 24:50.614
[man in Spanish] Attention, gentlemen.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.700
My name is Commander Pavón.

24:55.160 --> 24:59.456
What we do today, the way we do it,
it's what we'll be remembered for.

25:00.081 --> 25:04.085
I know some of you have
your old ways of doing business.

25:04.169 --> 25:09.382
Well, today will not be like that.
Today, the eyes of Mexico are on us.

25:09.549 --> 25:12.177
-Are we clear?
-[all] Yes, sir!

25:13.887 --> 25:15.472
Our friends in the DEA have provided

25:15.555 --> 25:18.808
a list of names and addresses
of the men we'll be chasing.

25:19.893 --> 25:23.230
Catching these men
is our highest priority.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.315
The sooner it's done...

25:25.774 --> 25:28.944
the sooner Agent Camarena is brought home.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.655
We begin where we can.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.866
Until the warrants come through,

25:35.450 --> 25:39.371
we'll start
where Agent Camarena was last seen.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.915
Place is called "The Camelot."

25:42.499 --> 25:45.877
Okay, gentlemen, time to work.
We don't have all day. Let's move!

25:45.961 --> 25:47.879
[indistinct chatter]

25:50.507 --> 25:52.217
[man in Spanish] Hey, Manny, come in.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.886
[Manny] What is it, man?

25:55.303 --> 25:56.972
Boss wants you at the runway.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.391
I'm outside the house in Yolando.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.309
[Manny] Is the boss leaving?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.812
-[man] Go to the airport.
-[Manny] Got it.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.022
Rafa's on the move.

26:06.856 --> 26:10.235
[in English] Warrants, sir?
I've not known this country to need them.

26:10.318 --> 26:14.573
Well, I'm sorry for your experience here
in Mexico, but I operate by the law.

26:14.656 --> 26:18.410
But interviewing cocktail waitresses
and bartenders isn't gonna do shit.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.203
-[Pavón] And my hands are tied.
-Chief!

26:21.413 --> 26:23.290
-[Knapp] Rafa's headed to the airport.
-When?

26:23.373 --> 26:24.749
-Now.
-[Jaime] Let's go.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.752
[in Spanish] Let's move, gentlemen,
what are you waiting for? Let's go!

26:29.170 --> 26:32.132
[Jaime in English] Hey!
Someone needs to radio the air tower!

26:32.215 --> 26:36.094
-Have them ground the flights!
-And risk Rafa being tipped? No way!

26:36.177 --> 26:37.387
[in Spanish] Step on it!

26:45.103 --> 26:47.063
[Sofia in Spanish]
Where are you going, baby?

26:47.147 --> 26:49.691
To see what's taking
these fucking guys so long.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.944
Every time you leave, I miss you.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.489
It'll only be two minutes, my love.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.912
Just two minutes.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.917
Cuco. What's up?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.045
Manuel, let's go.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.796
[Manny] All right, let's go!

27:12.005 --> 27:14.049
Check out what Manuel brought.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.300
Even the leftovers.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.801
[inhales]

27:16.885 --> 27:17.886
Ah.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.096
You ever smoked on a plane?

27:20.555 --> 27:23.183
-High while we're high?
-Just like birds.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.476
[both laugh]

27:24.559 --> 27:26.728
Ready. Whenever you like.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.984
Cuco. Bring the cash onboard.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.029
[Manny] Rafa!

27:41.117 --> 27:42.285
[Sofia] What's going on?

27:42.494 --> 27:43.953
Get inside!

27:44.496 --> 27:46.956
[indistinct chatter]

27:47.957 --> 27:50.168
[tires squeal]

27:50.251 --> 27:54.589
[agents yelling]

27:54.673 --> 27:55.965
[in English] Put 'em down!

27:56.049 --> 27:58.927
-[in Spanish] Calm down! Stand down!
-[in English] Put 'em down!

27:59.010 --> 28:01.137
[in Spanish] No one has to die here!

28:04.140 --> 28:05.850
No one has to die!

28:06.226 --> 28:07.060
Rafa!

28:08.186 --> 28:10.647
Doesn't have to be this way.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.357
We just want to talk.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.568
Manuel, let him pass.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.324
-[Rafa] Pat him down, Cuco.
-Turn around, asshole.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.164
He's clean.

28:36.798 --> 28:37.841
[Rafa] Get in.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.689
One million dollars.

28:54.357 --> 28:55.775
[Pavón] No bribes today.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.613
Put 'em on, this ends peacefully.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.991
I'm not going to jail.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.368
I'm going on vacation with my girl.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.130
[in English] What the fuck?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.428
[in Spanish] We have a situation.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.389
[in English] What's the move, sir?

29:27.724 --> 29:29.100
Just hold tight.

29:42.405 --> 29:43.573
[in Spanish] It's okay.

29:44.657 --> 29:45.742
You can go.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.662
-Lower your weapons.
-[sicarios laugh]

29:49.746 --> 29:51.414
We have the wrong man.

29:51.915 --> 29:55.126
[yelling in English] That is
Rafa Quintero on that fucking plane!

29:55.210 --> 29:59.464
[yelling] I'm afraid not.
That's a member of the DFS.

29:59.964 --> 30:03.802
Marcos Valenzuela.
His credentials are in order.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.104
[in Spanish] Goodbye, children!

30:15.855 --> 30:19.067
If you want to play,
next time bring better toys!

30:23.530 --> 30:25.365
[laughs]

30:36.584 --> 30:38.086
[indistinct chatter]

30:58.273 --> 31:00.108
[in English] Sending their best man?

31:01.109 --> 31:03.611
-Mika.
-Well, their best man just let Rafa go.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.905
Oh, you haven't heard.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.075
Then get off your ass
and start helping the other agents.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.077
Go find my fucking husband.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.204
Okay. Okay, okay. Just calm--

31:13.288 --> 31:15.707
Mrs. Camarena. I'm Ambassador John Gavin.

31:18.209 --> 31:21.004
This is Jack Lawn,
acting Administrator of the DEA.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.381
How can I help you?

31:24.549 --> 31:26.843
[narrator in English]
You want to get someone off their ass?

31:26.926 --> 31:28.052
Fucking embarrass them.

31:28.136 --> 31:30.471
Tonight, a new report
on the Mexican Connection.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.766
How authorities in that country
allegedly helped the kidnappers

31:33.850 --> 31:35.351
of an American drug enforcement agent--

31:35.435 --> 31:39.480
In Mexico, the suspect in the kidnapping
of a US drug agent has disappeared,

31:39.564 --> 31:43.026
and American officials are charging
that Mexican police helped in the getaway.

31:43.109 --> 31:47.155
He was stopped by Mexican police,
the judicial police,

31:47.238 --> 31:48.865
and allowed to leave.

31:48.948 --> 31:53.536
And we now learn that he had,
as protection, members of the DFS.

31:53.620 --> 31:57.373
[man] The Mexican police,
apparently on orders from Mexico City,

31:57.457 --> 31:59.834
have taken what amounts
to a three week siesta.

32:00.793 --> 32:04.172
[narrator] Wasn't subtle.
But with the American media piling on,

32:04.714 --> 32:08.426
the Mexican government had no choice
but to pull Comandante Pavón...

32:09.093 --> 32:11.095
something about alleged corruption,

32:12.972 --> 32:15.141
and assign the case to someone new.

32:15.475 --> 32:20.229
[in English] Heard you guys are looking
for an agent. Anything I can do to help?

32:22.857 --> 32:24.943
We've got a few addresses
we'd like to hit.

32:25.526 --> 32:28.237
[Jaime] Of course,
we're still waiting on the warrants.

32:28.905 --> 32:29.989
What's a warrant?

32:30.073 --> 32:31.240
[chuckles]

32:31.324 --> 32:32.492
There we go.

32:33.242 --> 32:34.786
[elevator dings]

32:49.592 --> 32:51.803
[in English]
Let's give Señor Félix a moment.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.183
[knock on door]

32:59.769 --> 33:00.937
[in Spanish] Come in!

33:01.020 --> 33:02.689
[door opens]

33:02.772 --> 33:04.357
[Tony in English] Visitor for you, sir.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.405
[Félix] Tony!

33:12.031 --> 33:16.703
[in Spanish] Tony, tell this guy
how many men you killed in Vietnam.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.246
[in English] Not enough, sir.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.498
[chuckles]

33:20.581 --> 33:21.791
[door closes]

33:21.874 --> 33:23.710
[in Spanish] He said, "Not enough."

33:23.793 --> 33:25.545
[chuckles]

33:28.715 --> 33:29.966
What's up, Azul?

33:31.175 --> 33:32.719
The situation with Rafa...

33:34.429 --> 33:36.431
it's led to some complications.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.308
They've sent Calderoni
to assist the Americans.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.186
Calderoni?

33:45.440 --> 33:47.233
And you'll hold him off?

33:49.610 --> 33:51.654
It's important you leave the hotel.

33:52.321 --> 33:53.531
The Americans have a list.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.119
If there's somewhere else you can go...

33:58.619 --> 34:01.831
Where the fuck would I go?
This is my hotel.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.171
and driving away in their trailers...

52:21.555 --> 52:22.889
...Charlotte died.

52:28.603 --> 52:30.856
The fairgrounds were soon deserted.

52:32.774 --> 52:35.485
The sheds and buildings
were empty and forlorn.

52:38.822 --> 52:41.825
The infield was littered
with bottles and trash.

52:45.162 --> 52:49.875
Nobody, of the hundreds of people
that had visited the fair,

52:50.709 --> 52:54.337
knew that a gray spider had played
the most important part of all.

53:19.821 --> 53:21.865
No one was with her when she died."
