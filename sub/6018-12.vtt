00:03.469 --> 00:06.064
Loyalty to any one sports team
is pretty hard to justify...

00:06.239 --> 00:09.037
...because the players are always
changing. The team can move.

00:09.209 --> 00:12.337
You're actually rooting for the clothes
when you get right down to it.

00:12.512 --> 00:15.072
I mean, you are standing
and cheering and yelling...

00:15.248 --> 00:18.615
...for your clothes to beat
the clothes from another city.

00:18.785 --> 00:20.548
Fans will be so in love
with a player...

00:20.720 --> 00:23.689
...but if he goes to another team,
they boo him.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.189
This is the same human being
in a different shirt.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.587
They hate him now.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.558
Boo.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.720
Different shirt.

00:31.898 --> 00:34.366
Boo.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.070
Sure you don't want the tickets?

00:39.239 --> 00:41.104
-No.
-I can't believe I'm having trouble...

00:41.274 --> 00:44.573
-...getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
-I'm telling you, skip the wedding.

00:44.744 --> 00:45.972
-Go to the game.
-I can't.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.704
The Drake put me
in the wedding party.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.281
Well, who schedules his wedding
on Super Bowl Sunday?

00:50.483 --> 00:52.974
-Maybe he didn't know.
-Let me see.

00:53.153 --> 00:56.122
I can't believe you got these for free.
What? Row F?

00:56.289 --> 00:57.517
Row F.

00:57.690 --> 01:00.215
In front of the G's.
Hobnobbing with the D's and E's.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.354
-How about Kramer or Elaine?
-Elaine laughed at me.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.394
Kramer's interested
in Canadian football.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.159
Well, wish I could help you.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.996
Come on, take them.
You could take Bonnie.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.605
You paying my hotel
and airfare to Miami?

01:13.773 --> 01:15.764
-What do you think?
-In order to use these...

01:15.942 --> 01:17.705
...I gotta spend, like, 1500 bucks.

01:17.877 --> 01:20.072
This is a bill for $1500.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.774
Plus, she'd ask about
the sleeping arrangements.

01:22.949 --> 01:25.281
I find sleeping-arrangement
conversations depressing.

01:25.452 --> 01:26.976
Yeah. Sleeping arrangements.

01:27.153 --> 01:29.087
-So you haven't--?
-Oh, no, no, no.

01:29.255 --> 01:32.452
I haven't even seen her apartment yet.
Tomorrow night's the first night.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.183
Hey, hey. Is that Tim Whatley?

01:34.661 --> 01:36.788
-The dentist?
-Is he mad at you for crashing...

01:36.963 --> 01:39.454
-...his Thanksgiving party?
-No. I explained it to him.

01:39.632 --> 01:40.997
-He was fine with it.
-Oh, good.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.964
Yeah. I blamed it on you.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.104
-Hi, Tim.
-Hey, Jerry.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.966
George.
What are you up to?

01:47.140 --> 01:50.007
Oh, just a couple gals out on the town,
shopping and gabbing.

01:50.176 --> 01:51.666
I'm getting a makeover.

01:53.012 --> 01:54.946
Hey, how'd you like
to go to the Super Bowl?

01:55.115 --> 01:58.380
-What, are you kidding?
-Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.

01:59.486 --> 02:01.977
How can I thank you?
I'll take you to dinner sometime.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.988
-You ever been to Mendy's?
-No. No, no. No dinner.

02:06.693 --> 02:09.594
Tim, you didn't have to get me
a thank-you gift.

02:09.762 --> 02:12.196
I know. It's a label maker.

02:12.365 --> 02:15.266
The Label Baby Junior.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.660
Yeah, I hear they're good.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.704
Well, label me thankful.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.539
Okay. Well, you enjoy those tickets.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.507
Bye-bye.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.508
Yeah?

02:29.682 --> 02:31.582
Come in.

02:32.952 --> 02:34.283
Hey, where can I put this?

02:34.454 --> 02:35.853
-What is it?
-It's Risk, Jerry.

02:36.022 --> 02:39.014
The game of world conquest.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.331
-All right, that's perfect.
-Kramer, why do you have to--?

02:46.032 --> 02:48.227
Hello, Newman.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.399
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it?
I gotta go to work.

02:51.571 --> 02:52.868
-Take what?
-The board, Jerry.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.872
We've been playing at Newman's
for six hours, but he's gotta go.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.840
-Why not leave it at Newman's?
-I wanted to. He won't let me.

02:59.012 --> 03:03.574
We have to put the board in a neutral
place where no one will tamper with it.

03:03.750 --> 03:07.709
-So that's here?
-Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.412
I don't wanna be Switzerland.

03:10.590 --> 03:14.526
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in
an epic struggle for world domination.

03:14.694 --> 03:18.221
It's winner take all.
People cannot be trusted.

03:18.398 --> 03:22.357
-Don't look at me.
-I'm looking right at you, big daddy.

03:23.636 --> 03:26.127
-All right, soldier boys. Let's fall out.
-Yeah.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.604
-All right, you're gonna look after it?
-Yeah, yeah.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.572
-Stay strong. Watch it good.
-Yeah. Okay.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.370
-Hey, hey.
-Hey. Hey.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.773
Hey.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.642
-Oh, is that a label maker?
-Yes, it is. I got it as a gift.

03:36.816 --> 03:39.478
It's a Label Baby Junior.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.552
Love the Label Baby, baby.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.884
You know, those things
make great gifts.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.116
I just got one for Tim Whatley
for Christmas.

03:46.793 --> 03:49.887
-Tim Whatley?
-Yeah. Who sent you that one?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.963
One Tim Whatley.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.564
No. My Tim Whatley?

03:54.734 --> 03:58.363
The same. He sent it as a thank you
for my Super Bowl tickets.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.901
I think this is the same one
I gave him.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.542
He recycled this gift.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.177
He's a re-gifter.

04:05.979 --> 04:10.643
Or maybe he liked your gift so much,
he decided to get me the same thing.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.512
Perhaps it's an homage.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.283
Yeah, perhaps.

04:14.454 --> 04:17.116
Well, how did he react
when you gave it to him?

04:17.290 --> 04:22.023
He said, "Oh, a label maker.
How about that."

04:22.195 --> 04:25.130
-He repeated the name of the gift?
-Yeah. So?

04:25.298 --> 04:28.358
Well, if you repeat the name
of the gift, you can't possibly like it.

04:28.534 --> 04:29.762
What do you mean?

04:29.936 --> 04:31.801
Like when someone
opens something and goes:

04:31.971 --> 04:34.337
"Oh, tube socks."

04:34.507 --> 04:36.168
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.708
I guess I'll just get invited
up to his apartment...

04:38.878 --> 04:42.109
-...and see if he's got a label maker.
-Why did you get him a gift?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.443
He did some dental work for me
and didn't charge.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.175
So I got him a Christmas present.

04:46.352 --> 04:49.583
Yeah, well, if you're getting him
anything for his birthday, I'm a large.

04:54.260 --> 04:57.525
Well, here we are.
This is the place.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.527
You like it?

05:00.700 --> 05:03.635
I love it. This is fantastic.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.294
Look at this couch. Is this velvet?

05:06.472 --> 05:07.700
Are you a velvet fan?

05:07.874 --> 05:09.432
A fan?

05:09.609 --> 05:13.841
I would drape myself in velvet
if it were socially acceptable.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.538
Look at this. Hardwood floors.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.316
Aren't they great?
Oh, Scott, hi.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.714
This is George.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.015
-Nice to meet you.
-This is Scott, my roommate.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.018
-Hey.
-Here. Check out this view.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.960
If you lean out this window,
you can see the river.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.070
So Scott's your roommate, huh?

05:39.972 --> 05:42.566
Yes. I'm sure I've mentioned him.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.607
No, I don't think
you mentioned him, no.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.379
He's a great guy.
You'll really like him.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.276
I'm sure I will.

05:50.983 --> 05:53.850
-Male roommate.
-Yes, a male roommate.

05:54.020 --> 05:57.183
-And this is a problem?
-It's a huge problem, Jerry.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.484
The hardest part
about having sex with a woman...

05:59.659 --> 06:03.254
...is getting her to come back
to your place. He's already got that.

06:03.429 --> 06:06.523
-Well, maybe he's--
-No, believe me, he's not.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.997
-So he's an eligible receiver.
-Right.

06:09.168 --> 06:11.159
She's confiding in him
about our dates.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.568
You always like the person you talk to
about the date more than the date.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.938
It's just a matter of time until they
realize, "Hey, we could have sex."

06:18.111 --> 06:19.339
-What's stopping them?
-Exactly.

06:19.512 --> 06:21.446
You know how they get animals
to reproduce?

06:21.614 --> 06:24.174
They just put them
in the same cage.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.112
-What does he look like?
-That's the worst part.

06:27.286 --> 06:29.277
He looks just like me.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.555
He looks like you,
and he's working from the inside?

06:32.725 --> 06:34.852
I look like me,
and I'm working from the outside.

06:35.027 --> 06:38.053
-Who is in the better position?
-Not you.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.165
This bizarre
Harrad Experiment must end.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.994
We'll take our check, please.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.465
I gotta find a way to work this out.
I love that apartment.

06:45.638 --> 06:48.072
It's so cozy.
I'm ensconced in velvet.

06:50.009 --> 06:51.874
-lf it was socially acceptable--
-I know.

06:52.044 --> 06:55.070
You would drape yourself
in velvet.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.840
-I've said that before?
-Many times.

06:57.016 --> 06:58.984
You love velvet.
You wanna live in velvet.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.086
Everything with the velvet.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.382
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.784
Guess what.

07:04.957 --> 07:07.687
-I saw Newman talking to the super.
-So what?

07:07.860 --> 07:10.192
The super has keys
to your apartment.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.853
Don't you see what's going on?

07:12.031 --> 07:14.693
Newman is planning
a sneak attack.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.528
Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.136
Yeah. All right, fine.
You sit there and you watch...

07:19.305 --> 07:22.604
...while Newman takes over the world,
but he'd be a horrible leader.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.073
And you know who's gonna suffer?
The little people.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.677
You and George.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.610
-Are you through?
-All right. Fine.

07:30.416 --> 07:31.906
I talked to Arthur Jobania.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.678
-The Drake's wedding. That's off.
-The wedding is off?

07:34.854 --> 07:36.219
-What happened?
-The Drake...

07:36.389 --> 07:40.120
...he found out that the wedding
is on the same day as the Super Bowl.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.658
So he wanted to postpone it.

07:41.828 --> 07:45.992
They got in a big argument
and...it's over.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.730
The wedding is off.
You can go to the Super Bowl.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.099
I can't call Tim
and ask for the tickets back.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.434
You just gave them to him
two days ago.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.406
He's gotta give you a grace period.

07:58.578 --> 08:02.776
Are you even vaguely familiar
with the concept of giving?

08:03.115 --> 08:05.242
There's no grace period.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.087
Well, didn't he re-gift
the label maker?

08:09.255 --> 08:11.621
-Possibly.
-Well, if he can re-gift...

08:11.791 --> 08:14.089
...why can't you de-gift?

08:15.628 --> 08:18.062
-You may have a point.
-I have a point. I have a point.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.197
-All right, I'll call him.
-Yeah.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.130
-What's that?
-Oh, it's Risk.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.031
It's a game of world domination...

08:25.204 --> 08:28.071
...being played by two guys
who can barely run their own lives.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.303
Hello, Tim?
Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.174
Hey, remember
those tickets I gave you?

08:35.347 --> 08:37.578
Well, it turns out I can use them.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.048
Oh, you do? I understand.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.049
Okay. Bye.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.155
He already made plans.
He can't change them.

08:44.323 --> 08:45.551
Well, they're his tickets.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.250
-He can do what he wants with them.
-Thanks.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.089
-I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
-What about the roommate?

08:51.264 --> 08:53.858
I gotta try and figure out a way
to switch places with him.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.866
It's like a Siegfried & Roy trick.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.560
The pickle breath is a good start.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.243
Hello, Jerry. May I come in?

09:07.413 --> 09:09.347
What do you want?

09:09.515 --> 09:11.142
Nothing.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.112
Just being neighborly.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.288
You wanna hang out?
Shoot the breeze?

09:17.456 --> 09:20.084
I won't let you cheat.
You're not getting near that board.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.386
Jerry, I'm a little insulted.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.087
You're not
a little anything, Newman.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.255
So just pack it up
and move it out of here.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.196
All right.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.802
Oh, by the way, what are you doing
for the Super Bowl?

09:31.971 --> 09:34.337
I don't know.
Watch it on TV, I guess. Why?

09:34.507 --> 09:36.441
If you watch closely,
you just might see me.

09:36.609 --> 09:39.772
I'll be the one waving to the camera
from my seat on the 40-yard line.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.607
-You're going to the Super Bowl?
-Yes.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.579
A guy on my mail route got
a couple tickets and offered me one.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.445
-What's his name?
-Tim Whatley.

09:46.619 --> 09:47.984
That's my ticket.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.054
Is it?

09:50.523 --> 09:51.751
Well, if only you'd known...

09:51.924 --> 09:56.054
...you could have saved some time
and given it directly to me.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.326
Newman.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.762
What a movie. Good choice.

10:03.936 --> 10:08.873
-Thank Scott. He recommended it.
-Oh, Scott, Scott.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.702
He's really great, isn't he?

10:10.876 --> 10:13.811
-Yes, he is.
-Yes, he is.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.972
Let me ask you something.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.451
When you come out of the shower
and put your robe on...

10:20.620 --> 10:23.111
...do you cinch it tight?
Are you concerned about that?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.484
George.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.091
Do you hold the neck together...

10:27.259 --> 10:30.251
...or are you just letting it flap
in the breeze?

10:30.930 --> 10:33.524
George, you're being ridiculous.

10:35.768 --> 10:38.328
What's the massage situation?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.402
-What do you mean?
-Is there any work being done?

10:41.574 --> 10:45.510
Is there any rubbing, touching, finger
manipulation on the other person?

10:45.678 --> 10:48.340
And if so,
who is making the request?

10:48.514 --> 10:52.280
George, would you just stop.

10:54.253 --> 10:57.484
Say you go into the bathroom
at 2:00 in the morning.

10:57.723 --> 11:01.784
What's the outfit? I mean, are you
dressing up, or is it come as you are?

11:01.961 --> 11:05.055
-George, what is wrong with you?
-I'll tell you what's wrong.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.563
A grown woman
with a male roommate.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.600
It's unnatural. It's an abomination.

11:11.771 --> 11:12.999
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.662
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.274
Do you need the bathroom?
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.241
No. Just throw my bras
out of the way.

11:23.149 --> 11:26.084
Well, this is my building.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.243
Yes, it is.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.719
-This was fun, you know?
-Yeah.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.317
So...

11:34.493 --> 11:37.121
...I guess I'll talk to you.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.594
Aren't you gonna
invite me upstairs?

11:39.765 --> 11:41.858
Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?

11:42.034 --> 11:44.298
I would love to go upstairs.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.266
Elaine, you are something else.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.307
No one could ever
put a label on you, huh?

11:51.477 --> 11:52.876
We'll see.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.944
Newman. He's going with Newman.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.881
How does Tim Whatley
even know Newman?

12:01.053 --> 12:02.543
Newman's his mailman.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.452
Who goes to the Super Bowl
with their mailman?

12:05.624 --> 12:08.058
Who goes anywhere with Newman?

12:09.028 --> 12:12.225
Well, he's merry.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.764
He is merry. I'll give him that.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.401
What's this plant for?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.561
Oh, I had a little tiff with Bonnie
about the roommate.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.406
Well, the cactus
will smooth things over.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.432
Hey. Guess what.

12:24.610 --> 12:28.410
I'm going to the Super Bowl
with Tim Whatley.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.071
-What?
-We went out for coffee...

12:30.249 --> 12:33.082
-...and he offered me a ticket.
-But what about the label maker?

12:34.353 --> 12:35.945
Well.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.556
Wait a minute. That's my ticket.
You didn't wanna go.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.089
It was totally out of the blue.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.092
We went upstairs to his apartment
to look for the label maker--

12:43.262 --> 12:45.526
How? Did you say
you had to use the bathroom?

12:45.698 --> 12:48.428
-No.
-Then how did you get up there?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.661
-I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
-And there's your ticket.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.498
-Well.
-What?

12:53.672 --> 12:55.936
That's why you're going
to the Super Bowl.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.373
-Why?
-You go out with a guy one time.

12:59.545 --> 13:03.174
You ask him to go upstairs
like you're Mae West.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.943
Of course he's gonna try
and get you alone for the weekend.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.382
You mean just because
I asked him to go upstairs...

13:08.554 --> 13:12.012
-...he thinks he's going downtown?
-Obviously.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.026
-You're crazy.
-Well, what happened upstairs?

13:15.194 --> 13:16.491
As soon as we walked in...

13:16.662 --> 13:19.631
...he got a call from one of his patients
with an impacted molar...

13:19.799 --> 13:22.359
...so he had to leave.
I didn't look for the label maker.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.799
I don't trust this guy.
I think he re-gifted...

13:24.970 --> 13:27.632
...and then de-gifted.
Now he's using an upstairs invite...

13:27.807 --> 13:30.071
...as a springboard
to a Super Bowl sex romp.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.018
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.180
-What are you doing?
-I'm watching your door.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.348
-My door?
-Yeah. From my peephole.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.323
Fisheye. Sees all.

13:56.402 --> 13:59.269
-What was that?
-Newman. Open it. Open it. Open.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.534
Damn.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.237
The bedroom.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.872
Get him.

14:10.683 --> 14:15.586
-I see you, Newman. I see you.
-I'm taking the Congo as a penalty.

14:16.388 --> 14:18.379
I've got a confession to make.

14:18.991 --> 14:22.085
-What's that?
-I've got Super Bowl fever.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.420
-Yeah. Yeah, me too.
-Yeah.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.862
-So where are we staying?
-Oh, the Ambassador.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.805
Big room?

14:35.975 --> 14:39.467
It's a regular room,
but it's right downtown.

14:39.778 --> 14:42.611
-Downtown?
-Right downtown.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.410
What do they have there?
A couple of beds?

14:48.587 --> 14:51.556
Why? You bringing someone else?

14:52.491 --> 14:54.322
No...

14:54.493 --> 14:56.620
...but don't you think
there should be two beds?

14:56.795 --> 14:58.854
There's two of us.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.600
Oh, a cactus.

15:05.771 --> 15:06.999
They don't need any water...

15:07.172 --> 15:09.834
...so you don't have to keep
taking them to the bathroom.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.807
Well...

15:13.112 --> 15:15.046
...look who's here.

15:16.181 --> 15:17.739
I asked Scott to move out.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.846
So she kicked him out
of the apartment?

15:25.024 --> 15:26.787
That's right.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.257
It's just me and her.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.623
She rearranged
her whole life for you.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.957
Yeah, I guess she did.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.661
He's gone. Now I'm the man.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.963
That's not a good role for you.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.834
No, it's not.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.305
You unwittingly made
a major commitment.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.000
That's a lot of pressure.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.409
Oh, my God.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.374
You wanted to be
ensconced in velvet.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.347
You're buried.

15:53.986 --> 15:57.012
I had the perfect situation here.
He was shouldering half the load.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.522
-He was shouldering.
-I couldn't leave well enough alone.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.126
Where you going?

16:02.294 --> 16:05.627
I gotta go help tape up all his boxes
and get them ready for shipping.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.823
Well, here.
Take Whatley's label maker.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.366
-I don't wanna see it again.
-Thanks.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.764
Yeah. I am taking over
South America...

16:14.940 --> 16:16.999
...and there ain't nothing
you can do about it.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.371
Too bad about that
Super Bowl ticket, huh, Newman?

16:19.545 --> 16:22.412
Yeah. I just hope
Tim Whatley's electric bills...

16:22.581 --> 16:25.311
...don't suddenly
get lost in the mail...

16:25.484 --> 16:28.715
...or it could be lights out for him.

16:28.887 --> 16:30.752
Okay. Thanks for
having me over, guys.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.686
Yeah.

16:34.193 --> 16:36.593
-All right, I'll see you later.
-Oh, hey, Jerry.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.696
Tim Whatley. Out scalping?

16:39.865 --> 16:42.390
See, now, I've been thinking a lot
about what happened.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.264
I feel horrible. Listen,
I wanna give you a ticket back.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.031
-Are you serious? What about Elaine?
-Oh, Elaine, yeah.

16:48.207 --> 16:51.506
Well, things just didn't work out
like I thought they would.

16:52.444 --> 16:55.106
Hey, isn't this Kramer's car?

16:55.280 --> 16:59.273
Hey, Cosmo!
They're towing your car.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.743
What?

17:03.455 --> 17:05.423
Not my car!

17:07.760 --> 17:10.661
They're towing my car.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.955
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking the board with me.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.034
Hey.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.935
Hey! Hey, wait!

17:25.144 --> 17:26.406
Wait!

17:26.578 --> 17:29.308
Hey, wait a minute!

17:29.481 --> 17:30.743
Hey!

17:30.916 --> 17:33.510
-So I guess I'll see you at the game.
-Yeah, see you there.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.619
Okay. Good.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.458
Hi, George.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.256
Where--?

17:44.430 --> 17:47.422
What happened? Where's--?
Where's all the stuff?

17:47.599 --> 17:49.590
It's gone. It was all his.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.102
Is this a label maker?

17:52.271 --> 17:57.607
But the table, the stereo, the VCR--
The velvet couch. Where's the velvet?

17:57.776 --> 17:59.334
They were his.

17:59.511 --> 18:03.038
Besides, we don't need
any of those things.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.843
We have each other.

18:10.289 --> 18:12.780
Are you sure you know
where the impound yard is?

18:12.958 --> 18:14.858
Oh, stop stalling. Come on.

18:15.027 --> 18:18.121
I-- I can't think.
There's all this noise.

18:18.297 --> 18:21.733
Or is it because I've built
a stronghold around Greenland...

18:21.900 --> 18:24.460
...I've driven you out
of Western Europe...

18:24.636 --> 18:28.595
...and I've left you teetering
on the brink of complete annihilation?

18:28.774 --> 18:32.005
I'm not beaten yet.
I still have armies in the Ukraine.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.668
Yeah? The Ukraine.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.714
You know what the Ukraine is?
It's a sitting duck.

18:37.883 --> 18:39.714
A road apple, Newman.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.716
The Ukraine is weak.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.377
It's feeble.

18:43.555 --> 18:46.353
I think it's time
to put the hurt on the Ukraine.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.858
I come from Ukraine.
You not say Ukraine weak.

18:50.028 --> 18:51.620
Yeah, we're playing
a game here, pal.

18:51.797 --> 18:56.166
Ukraine is game to you? How about
I take your little board and smash!

19:00.839 --> 19:02.830
Hello, Tim.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.670
-Elaine, hi.
-Don't worry, Tim.

19:05.844 --> 19:08.540
I didn't come by to yell at you.
I didn't come by for that.

19:08.714 --> 19:12.844
I just came by
to pick up my label maker.

19:13.018 --> 19:16.977
I gave you a label maker,
and now I would like to have it back.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.214
But you gave it to me.

19:18.390 --> 19:21.359
But you gave me a ticket
to the Super Bowl.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.552
Hand it over, Whatley.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.557
Okay.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.193
You don't have the label maker,
do you?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.831
-No.
-I knew it.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.939
-You're a re-gifter.
-Oh, yeah. Some gift.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.041
-That thing didn't work at all.
-What?

19:37.209 --> 19:40.144
You put a label on something,
10 minutes later it would peel off.

19:40.312 --> 19:43.281
It was the worst gift I ever got.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.281
Well, I bought it for you...

19:48.954 --> 19:52.583
...because you were so nice to me for
not charging me for the dental work.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.958
The way you worked on my filling,
you were so--

19:58.130 --> 20:03.090
So gentle and so caring
and so sensitive.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.967
Oh, Elaine.

20:20.452 --> 20:21.942
H...

20:22.120 --> 20:23.587
...G...

20:23.755 --> 20:27.247
...F. Seat four.

20:27.426 --> 20:32.420
One, two, three--

20:34.833 --> 20:36.733
Hello, Newman.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.063
Hello, Jerry.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.832
Tim couldn't make it. He's in love.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.906
-Isn't that wonderful?
-Oh, it's enchanting.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.515
Here's the TV.

20:53.685 --> 20:56.882
I know you wanted to watch
the Super Bowl.

21:01.727 --> 21:05.458
Do you at least have some towels
we could sit on?

21:05.631 --> 21:07.622
It's, like, a four-hour game.

21:09.067 --> 21:13.003
George, Scott's gonna drop by.
He said he never got his boxes.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.699
I'll get the towels.

21:15.874 --> 21:20.436
<i>How am I gonna get out of this?
Think, Costanza. Think!</i>

21:23.348 --> 21:26.181
-Here we are.
-Hey.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.943
Do you know, Bonnie, l--

21:29.121 --> 21:31.851
I just had a pretty wild idea.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.720
-What is it?
-Well, l--

21:34.893 --> 21:38.420
I'm not sure how you
pronounce it or anything, but l--

21:38.730 --> 21:42.393
I believe it's <i>ménage à trois</i> ?

21:42.567 --> 21:44.558
What?

21:45.370 --> 21:47.133
-Hi.
-Scott.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.501
Remember what we talked about
the other day?

21:49.675 --> 21:51.939
George is into it.

21:54.212 --> 21:56.578
Oh, really?

22:11.563 --> 22:13.963
Great streak of luck I'm having.

22:14.132 --> 22:18.364
First Kramer almost beats me at Risk,
but I narrowly escape...

22:18.537 --> 22:21.472
...and then Tim Whatley
gives me this Super Bowl ticket.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.574
Can you move over at all?

22:23.742 --> 22:26.267
And then--
Then, just as I'm about to go...

22:26.445 --> 22:31.280
...these boxes show up
at the post office with no labels.

22:31.650 --> 22:34.551
No labels, Jerry.
You know what that means?

22:34.720 --> 22:36.950
Freebies!

22:37.789 --> 22:41.919
I got this great mini TV and a VCR.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.959
-It's unbelievable.
-An inch.

22:44.129 --> 22:47.030
-Can you move over an inch?
-Oh, come on.
