WEBVTT

00:01.117 --> 00:02.717
During your weekend
here,

00:02.786 --> 00:05.280
you will explore ways
through yoga,

00:05.484 --> 00:07.929
breathing
and other mindful pratices

00:08.077 --> 00:11.226
to reconnect with yourself
and your partner.

00:11.477 --> 00:13.484
Also,
or a small donation,

00:13.601 --> 00:16.554
we have an on-site shaman
who can heal your chakras.

00:17.031 --> 00:20.007
Small donation?
Sounds like a "chakra con".

00:21.617 --> 00:22.915
You're supposed
to turn that off.

00:22.984 --> 00:24.869
- I'm sorry. It's work.
- Okay, so is a marriage.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.502
You know, we traveled all this way.
The least you could do

00:26.570 --> 00:27.470
is take this seriously.

00:27.539 --> 00:28.868
I'm sorry. You're right.

00:29.119 --> 00:32.526
Oh, my God, that... that
crappy breakfast was $55.

00:32.595 --> 00:33.800
- For flax and berries.
- Yeah.

00:33.869 --> 00:36.001
I thought this was supposed to
be one fee up front, all in.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.315
I wish <i> you</i> were all in, Mitchell.

00:37.383 --> 00:40.648
I'm sor... I am. Starting... now. Okay.

00:41.164 --> 00:42.314
That wasn't me.

00:42.383 --> 00:45.281
I have invited the Tibetan
Singing Bowl to ring,

00:45.429 --> 00:47.859
reminding us to all
turn down the volume

00:48.023 --> 00:50.512
and find the beauty in silence.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.414
That was unfortunate.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.117
My apologies. We happen to be
next door to the Royals.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.329
Oh, my God,
we just binged "The Crown".

00:59.398 --> 01:01.202
W-W-Which royals?
William and Kate?

01:01.271 --> 01:02.430
Harry and the "Suits" girl?

01:02.499 --> 01:05.421
Actually, it's the Kansas City Royals.
Spring training,

01:05.491 --> 01:07.327
their practice field is
next door.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.798
Growing up a Royals fan,
it was always my dream

01:09.867 --> 01:11.241
to see them at spring training.

01:11.308 --> 01:13.227
So, I just decided,
after the retreat was over,

01:13.296 --> 01:15.601
I'm just gonna swing by,
you know, grab an autograph,

01:15.670 --> 01:18.132
maybe whisper an opinion
in the manager's ear,

01:18.209 --> 01:20.406
be discovered
as a great baseball mind.

01:20.519 --> 01:22.126
Then the Yankees would
come calling,

01:22.195 --> 01:24.279
and then I'd have to choose
between the team I love

01:24.348 --> 01:25.921
and the... the big payout.

01:25.990 --> 01:27.852
But... I'm getting
ahead of myself.

01:28.070 --> 01:30.961
Not to worry. This is
their last day of training,

01:31.028 --> 01:32.148
and they leave tonight.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.445
- Excuse me, question.
- Yes.

01:33.514 --> 01:36.015
Yes, hi. Will we have
an opportunity to explore

01:36.084 --> 01:37.929
these... these beautiful
grounds on our own?

01:37.998 --> 01:40.140
Absolutely.
Tomorrow at sunset.

01:40.298 --> 01:41.913
After goat yoga.

01:43.519 --> 01:45.859
Oh, my God! Can it get any worse?!

01:59.349 --> 02:01.224
Arrgh! Ughh!

02:01.293 --> 02:04.607
What are you doing? I grunted less
when I was giving birth to Joe.

02:04.676 --> 02:07.552
You were pushing six and a half
pounds, I'm pushing 220.

02:08.103 --> 02:09.513
You're dressing younger.

02:09.582 --> 02:11.157
You're exercising.

02:11.505 --> 02:13.763
You only had one breakfast
this morning.

02:14.303 --> 02:16.999
- Who is she, Jay? I'll kill her.
- Relax, would ya?

02:17.068 --> 02:18.630
I'm just trying to get in shape.

02:19.343 --> 02:20.951
Okay, but hurry,
because we have to go

02:21.020 --> 02:22.795
and pick up Joe
at the birthday party.

02:23.142 --> 02:24.403
Wait a minute.

02:24.472 --> 02:26.100
Is that what
this is all about...

02:26.169 --> 02:27.521
Henry's father?

02:27.623 --> 02:29.311
I don't understand
why you're so insecure

02:29.380 --> 02:31.166
just because he's younger,

02:31.235 --> 02:33.330
stronger, and
more rugged than you are.

02:33.399 --> 02:35.927
Go easy. I'm working on
only one breakfast.

02:36.165 --> 02:38.127
Joe won't shut up about
his new friend's dad.

02:38.210 --> 02:40.459
"Henry's dad is
so tough". Who cares?

02:40.531 --> 02:42.755
He was a stunt double in
a couple of "Bourne" movies.

02:42.824 --> 02:44.959
From the first time
Joe went over there,

02:44.989 --> 02:47.427
that guy's been trying
to prove how cool he is.

02:47.740 --> 02:48.865
Joe! Let's go!

02:48.934 --> 02:50.130
Heads up!

02:52.409 --> 02:54.248
- What the hell?!
- Yeah!

02:54.334 --> 02:55.779
He's Jason Bourne!

02:55.846 --> 02:57.041
That's make-believe.

02:57.108 --> 02:59.131
Matt Damon's Jason Bourne.

02:59.433 --> 03:02.365
Growing up, I thought
my dad was the coolest.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.756
And that made me feel
good about myself.

03:04.955 --> 03:06.404
I mean, I try to stay with it.

03:06.512 --> 03:09.193
Exactly! Look at you,
you even have a smart watch.

03:09.262 --> 03:11.107
Yeah, the damn thing tells me
when to stand up,

03:11.176 --> 03:12.216
when to breathe.

03:12.329 --> 03:14.916
- <i>Your body mass index is...</i>
- Nobody asked!

03:15.799 --> 03:19.329
Which have more chromosomes,
potatoes or humans?

03:19.426 --> 03:22.020
Humans, right? Potatoes?!

03:22.997 --> 03:25.947
Oh, Krazy Kups,
what can't you teach us?

03:26.016 --> 03:28.026
Are you doing all this to
impress Haley's boyfriend?

03:28.094 --> 03:30.475
Haley's dating this genius
astrophysics professor

03:30.544 --> 03:32.037
who's somehow making her
smarter

03:32.106 --> 03:34.176
because, last week,
I called Pluto a planet

03:34.245 --> 03:35.623
and Haley laughed at me.

03:35.790 --> 03:37.045
In pity.

03:37.576 --> 03:39.383
- Haley.
- Haley.

03:39.779 --> 03:40.912
Haley.

03:41.611 --> 03:44.811
Do we think that Haley
is suited to a professor,

03:44.895 --> 03:47.217
because I more saw her
with a Gilligan type?

03:47.329 --> 03:49.076
Come on, now.
Lots of happy couples

03:49.177 --> 03:51.212
aren't the exact same level of smart.

03:51.429 --> 03:53.279
That's true.
We work.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.592
Yeah.

03:56.068 --> 03:57.967
Wait.
When you say, "We work,"

03:58.036 --> 04:00.321
do you think you're smarter
than me or I'm smarter than you?

04:00.389 --> 04:02.096
I think I'm smart enough
not to have this conversation.

04:02.164 --> 04:03.638
Oh, my God!

04:03.800 --> 04:06.968
You do! You think
you're smarter than me!

04:07.037 --> 04:09.920
Okay, hotshot.
How many patents do you have?

04:09.989 --> 04:12.030
Headscratcher TM, Aspirin Gun,

04:12.134 --> 04:14.597
Polite Car Horn that'll
put an end to road rage.

04:14.666 --> 04:16.317
Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

04:16.387 --> 04:19.060
Can we just not get into a whole
thing before this lunch?

04:19.130 --> 04:20.726
What lunch? I just ate a pie.

04:20.821 --> 04:23.557
Your sister is dating
a professor of astrophysics,

04:23.626 --> 04:25.885
and he's coming here today
to meet us.

04:25.988 --> 04:28.086
Oh, good, someone to talk to.

04:28.211 --> 04:30.782
I'm tired of dumbing it down
for you chuckle-heads.

04:31.790 --> 04:33.733
Bill, are you on your way?

04:33.837 --> 04:35.376
Stay in the car. I'll meet you outside.

04:35.444 --> 04:37.758
It was hard for me when Haley
started dating Arvin,

04:37.884 --> 04:40.286
my professor
and science hero and...

04:40.469 --> 04:42.274
okay, fine, crush.

04:42.461 --> 04:46.055
I was so upset, I went home,
and I may have overindulged...

04:46.549 --> 04:48.175
on Bagel Bites.

04:51.016 --> 04:52.205
- Hey.
- Aah!

04:52.274 --> 04:53.742
It's okay. You're safe.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.030
But I'm gonna need you to come with me.

04:55.098 --> 04:57.229
I don't really think you need... Okay.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.869
<i>He was like a superhero.</i>

04:58.938 --> 04:59.969
Is that your dad?

05:00.038 --> 05:02.680
<i>A beautiful...
not-so-smart superhero.</i>

05:02.828 --> 05:04.523
The last thing I wanted
was Professor Fennerman

05:04.590 --> 05:06.266
finding out I was dating a dummy.

05:06.641 --> 05:09.618
A sweet, chiseled dummy.

05:10.423 --> 05:14.150
Alex, you didn't mention you've
got a firefighter boyfriend.

05:14.219 --> 05:15.392
Yeah! It's great.

05:15.461 --> 05:17.119
"Take that, you fire".
We gotta go.

05:17.188 --> 05:19.238
Oh, but your parents just
invited me to stay for lunch.

05:19.306 --> 05:20.532
Score!

05:20.710 --> 05:23.196
By the way, you look way younger
than your poster.

05:23.513 --> 05:25.500
We really should get
going before we...

05:25.602 --> 05:27.627
we miss our plans and stuff,
right?

05:27.696 --> 05:28.721
- Yeah.
- Uh, yeah...

05:28.790 --> 05:30.831
Alex! I didn't know you were
joining us for lunch.

05:30.899 --> 05:32.759
Oh! No, no.

05:32.828 --> 05:36.632
My-My friend and I have some plans
we really can't get out of.

05:36.761 --> 05:39.354
Oh, no, I could totally just
show you "Backdraft" later.

05:39.432 --> 05:41.713
It's my brother's DVD.
He doesn't even know I took it.

05:41.780 --> 05:44.533
- So...
- Mom, Dad, this is Arvin.

05:44.602 --> 05:46.768
Hello, Arvin.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

05:46.852 --> 05:49.588
Yes, you are the first TED
Talkin' science superstar

05:49.665 --> 05:51.011
- we've ever had in our house.
- Mm-hmm.

05:51.079 --> 05:54.486
Well, as long as I'm a
"superstar" and not a supernova.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.531
You don't even know what
you're laughing at.

06:00.599 --> 06:01.908
- I get it.
- I got it more.

06:01.977 --> 06:05.404
I don't get it, but, uh,
you sound like Austin Powers, man.

06:09.766 --> 06:12.619
Wow. Henry's dad did
such a great job

06:12.688 --> 06:14.416
with the birthday party
for the kids, huh?

06:14.483 --> 06:15.993
"Henry's dad". "Henry's dad".

06:16.062 --> 06:18.625
I took Joe to see "African Queen"
in CinemaScope.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.278
Oh, hey.
Good to see you again, Jay.

06:20.352 --> 06:21.793
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Clay.

06:21.862 --> 06:23.845
I'd shake your hand,
but I'm a little banged up.

06:23.914 --> 06:25.955
I fell out of a five-story
building this morning,

06:26.024 --> 06:28.799
- into a net.
- He fell out of bed this morning.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.162
Hey, honey.
Come down and meet these guys.

06:31.229 --> 06:33.369
Oh, hey!

06:35.649 --> 06:38.029
Welcome. I'm Jenny, Henry's mom.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.478
Joe's parents... Jay, Gloria.

06:39.547 --> 06:40.367
- Hi.
- Gloria.

06:40.436 --> 06:43.429
Mama! Henry's mom just did
the wall so fast!

06:43.498 --> 06:44.532
You try it.

06:44.601 --> 06:47.376
Oh, I climb already into
these heels this morning.

06:47.445 --> 06:49.042
It's too much for me today.

06:49.111 --> 06:51.580
- I'm going up again!
- Okay.

06:51.649 --> 06:54.406
Oh, I used to love
wearing shoes like that.

06:54.531 --> 06:56.744
But after marching around in
combat boots for two years,

06:56.813 --> 06:59.898
I made a deal with my feet
I would never hurt them again.

07:00.110 --> 07:02.165
My beautiful wife
did two tours in Iraq.

07:02.343 --> 07:04.735
Wow, Gloria,
you're not that different.

07:04.804 --> 07:07.962
Yesterday, she did
two tours of a sales rack.

07:09.969 --> 07:12.626
- Help! I'm too high!
- Oh!

07:12.768 --> 07:14.548
Go ahead, just jump,
buddy. I'll catch ya.

07:14.617 --> 07:17.687
- But your sciatica!
- I'm on it.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.797
What is the hurry?
He's on a rope.

07:22.156 --> 07:25.018
- She's making quite a meal out of this.
- Yeah.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.182
Attaboy.

07:30.570 --> 07:33.003
Thank you, Jenny. You're so cool.

07:33.072 --> 07:36.054
Ah, look at that, Gloria. She saved him.

07:36.242 --> 07:38.025
Just like she saved America.

07:38.148 --> 07:41.025
Can I have some more cake?
Jenny made it.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.968
I used to cook for my squadron.

07:43.037 --> 07:44.517
You've done
so many great things

07:44.586 --> 07:46.182
that you keep telling us about.

07:48.313 --> 07:50.644
Here we are...
our sensory deprivation tanks

07:50.713 --> 07:52.074
will disconnect you
from the world

07:52.211 --> 07:54.020
and connect you
with yourselves.

07:54.089 --> 07:55.988
Okay, so,
this looks a little coffin-y.

07:56.057 --> 07:58.711
So, I'm not so sure...
about my husband.

07:59.086 --> 08:01.822
He had an MRI last year,
and he sort of freaked out.

08:01.891 --> 08:03.319
So, do you have anything bigger,

08:03.388 --> 08:05.729
like, an indoor pool or a family tank?

08:05.798 --> 08:07.235
Okay, Mitchell, I-I'm fine.

08:07.304 --> 08:09.422
We're here to evolve
and grow...

08:09.539 --> 08:11.407
So, the float lasts for one hour,

08:11.476 --> 08:13.584
during which most people
simply experience

08:13.691 --> 08:15.665
a deep, relaxed state.

08:15.763 --> 08:18.399
Most people? W-What about the rest?
W-What do they experience?

08:18.468 --> 08:20.568
Okay, a-are these scratches
on this lid here?

08:20.637 --> 08:23.045
Oh, come on, Mitchell.
The flower that blooms in adversity

08:23.114 --> 08:25.773
is the most rare and
beautiful of all.

08:25.844 --> 08:27.102
Very well put.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.293
He didn't make that up.
It's from "Mulan".

08:29.343 --> 08:30.963
Our daughter made us
watch it a thousand times.

08:31.031 --> 08:34.634
I... Well, I'm lashing! Okay,
maybe we should just float.

08:34.703 --> 08:37.164
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Let's just float.

08:38.501 --> 08:39.952
Okay.

08:47.813 --> 08:50.181
I tried to relax in there,
I really did.

08:50.256 --> 08:51.351
But it was difficult.

08:51.420 --> 08:53.688
I-I guess because I felt
like I was, um...

08:53.761 --> 08:55.211
Oh, what's the word?

08:55.406 --> 08:56.469
Dying.

08:56.547 --> 08:57.963
<i>But I got past that,</i>

08:58.032 --> 09:00.947
<i>only to start reliving every
mistake I have ever made,</i>

09:01.016 --> 09:03.477
<i>like when I went to
an Oscar party and I said</i>

09:03.587 --> 09:06.602
<i>"Bett" Davis in front of a room
full of vicious gays.</i>

09:06.805 --> 09:08.625
Honestly, the only thing
that kept me in there

09:08.711 --> 09:10.836
was the knowledge that Cam
was right next door.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.282
Go Royals! I-I love you!

09:13.351 --> 09:14.519
It was a solid plan...

09:14.588 --> 09:16.642
just go for a quick peek,
take some pictures,

09:16.711 --> 09:18.282
run back,
splash some water in my hair,

09:18.351 --> 09:22.070
"Oh, Mitchell, isn't floating
so relaxing?"

09:27.078 --> 09:28.822
- Got it!
- Nice catch.

09:28.891 --> 09:30.439
- Oh.
- That was good.

09:30.508 --> 09:33.353
Oh, my gosh. Uh, M-Mr. Brett.
I didn't know you would be here.

09:33.422 --> 09:34.572
Hi. Call me George.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.909
- Oh, George.
- Yeah, how are ya?

09:35.977 --> 09:38.244
- Uh, good. My name's Cameron.
- Nice to meet you, Cam.

09:38.313 --> 09:39.589
Nice to meet you. Been a fan for...

09:39.657 --> 09:41.059
Hey, do you mind if I get a picture?

09:41.127 --> 09:43.587
Not at all. Not at all.
300 bucks, how's that sound?

09:44.166 --> 09:45.267
I'm retired.

09:45.375 --> 09:46.923
- 300?
- I'm just kidding.

09:47.991 --> 09:48.991
Come on, it's free.

09:49.060 --> 09:50.352
Okay... Ow!

09:52.266 --> 09:53.601
Alright. There it is.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.623
- There they are!
- There ya go!

09:55.692 --> 09:57.299
Well, listen, I don't want to
take up too much of your time.

09:57.367 --> 09:58.660
- Thank you s...
- I got all the time in the world.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.140
I'm not playing.
I'm just coaching.

10:00.209 --> 10:01.172
- Okay.
- Yeah. Come here.

10:01.241 --> 10:03.087
Let me tell you the story
about the Pine Tar game.

10:03.155 --> 10:04.768
- Oh, wow!
- You wanna hear that?

10:04.837 --> 10:05.783
- Sure.
- Come on.

10:05.852 --> 10:07.526
- Okay.
- But first, let me tell you about...

10:07.594 --> 10:09.753
I'm gonna tell you about dinner
the night before.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.641
You must be the genius boyfriend.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.204
That is what the guys call me.

10:16.273 --> 10:17.981
They're always, like,
you know,

10:18.040 --> 10:20.760
- "Hey, genius". "Hey, guys".
- I'm like.

10:21.140 --> 10:23.258
So, tell me, are there aliens?

10:23.407 --> 10:24.758
You kidding? 100%.

10:24.827 --> 10:27.680
Oh, I knew it. Wait,
and the zombiepocalypse?

10:27.749 --> 10:29.134
Dude, I tell everyone,

10:29.203 --> 10:32.432
"Start building up an immunity
to zombie bites. Now".

10:32.555 --> 10:34.322
I'm so glad we talked.

10:34.999 --> 10:37.452
Um. Sorry for the
interruption.

10:37.523 --> 10:40.136
- Everything okay?
- Well, the short story is, yes.

10:40.205 --> 10:43.280
The long story is,
the theory on which I've based

10:43.437 --> 10:45.866
much of my career
has just been disproven.

10:46.031 --> 10:48.124
What? Your Vacuum Energy
Density Theory?

10:48.193 --> 10:49.723
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
- Me, too.

10:49.792 --> 10:52.891
That was the density theory
I thought really worked.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.917
Really, Phil,
what was your second choice?

10:55.374 --> 10:57.829
Well, that's all part of
the process, isn't it?

10:57.898 --> 11:00.929
My theory actually invalidated
someone else's.

11:01.273 --> 11:02.934
He jumped off a building...

11:03.038 --> 11:05.454
um, just very dramatic.

11:05.523 --> 11:08.882
But, well, I'm British.
So, no worries.

11:08.991 --> 11:11.155
What smells so good?

11:11.281 --> 11:12.755
Uh. Uh, it's the chicken!

11:12.824 --> 11:15.341
So, Bill, you are a firefighter?

11:15.410 --> 11:18.062
Yeah, my three favorite things
are helping people,

11:18.187 --> 11:20.392
sliding down poles,
and hanging off trucks,

11:20.461 --> 11:22.648
so I figured might as well
make a career out of it.

11:22.726 --> 11:24.110
Well, it's good that
your favorite things

11:24.178 --> 11:27.609
weren't chloroform, duct tape,
and windowless vans.

11:30.433 --> 11:32.481
Claire, the joke is
he'd be a kidnapper.

11:32.558 --> 11:33.590
I got it.

11:33.659 --> 11:36.858
You know, Phil used to think
it was "duck" tape.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.474
Like, duck.

11:38.541 --> 11:41.116
Claire didn't understand
the ending of "La La Land".

11:41.327 --> 11:43.524
Sorry. They're not
normally like this.

11:43.608 --> 11:44.846
Clearly, they're going
through something

11:44.914 --> 11:46.422
they can't even drop
for one important lunch.

11:46.490 --> 11:47.991
They're arguing over
who's smarter,

11:48.060 --> 11:49.556
and there's only one way
to settle it.

11:49.634 --> 11:51.387
Another time, in the presence
of a marriage counselor?

11:51.455 --> 11:52.894
Nope. Brain Battle.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.621
No. No, we're not doing that
right now.

11:54.690 --> 11:56.688
I'm so sorry, Arvin.
We're being silly.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.363
"How many presidents died
in office?"

11:58.432 --> 11:59.624
- Eight.
- Six.

11:59.757 --> 12:01.172
The correct answer is eight.

12:01.241 --> 12:03.405
- Ha! Ha!
- Damn it. Give me another one.

12:03.498 --> 12:05.324
Why was six afraid of seven?

12:06.484 --> 12:08.984
'Cause seven, eight, nine.

12:09.961 --> 12:11.226
Like he "ate" it.

12:11.530 --> 12:12.726
"Who wrote 'Moby Dick'?"

12:12.795 --> 12:14.655
Herman Munster.
<i>Herman</i> Munster.

12:14.724 --> 12:16.562
- Herman Melville.
- Melville!

12:16.692 --> 12:19.038
"How many moons does Jupiter have?"

12:20.005 --> 12:22.539
Oh, is it alright if I take this one?

12:22.628 --> 12:24.555
- Mm-hmm.
- 27.

12:24.624 --> 12:25.562
67.

12:25.631 --> 12:27.656
Hmm? No, that's... that's wrong.

12:27.725 --> 12:32.218
67 is Uranus and Jupiter's 27,
right, Alex?

12:32.421 --> 12:34.075
Actually, no.

12:34.414 --> 12:36.062
But it's a simple mistake, though.

12:36.148 --> 12:38.939
- You just flipped them.
- Well, this is mortifying, isn't it?

12:39.130 --> 12:42.840
I have a doctorate
in astrophysics. Idiot.

12:42.969 --> 12:46.609
First, some puffed-up Swedes
invalidate my life's work.

12:46.890 --> 12:50.539
And then I'm bested by
a little bedtime gurgle cup!

12:50.991 --> 12:53.163
I'm sorry. I'm going to need a moment.

12:53.351 --> 12:55.578
67 moons. What an idiot.

12:56.845 --> 12:58.880
Well, all's I know is

12:59.118 --> 13:00.713
the Earth only has one moon

13:00.805 --> 13:03.991
and I saw a documentary
and we didn't even land on it.

13:04.079 --> 13:06.238
Oh, my God, stop talking.

13:07.281 --> 13:09.204
You know,
you're being kind of mean.

13:09.634 --> 13:11.115
I'm gonna need a moment, too.

13:11.184 --> 13:12.634
This is why I don't bring
boyfriends home.

13:12.702 --> 13:15.291
Why didn't you ask me before
inviting him to lunch?

13:18.308 --> 13:20.702
"This Paul Newman character
had a 'cool hand'?"

13:20.788 --> 13:22.369
- Luke!
- Yep.

13:22.734 --> 13:24.680
Counts! Counts.

13:25.132 --> 13:28.655
Henry's dad climbed the wall
with one hand! It was awesome!

13:28.724 --> 13:31.595
Yeah, well, his career
rides on Matt Damon

13:31.664 --> 13:33.839
not doing any artsy,
think-y movies,

13:33.921 --> 13:35.266
so I wouldn't count on Henry

13:35.335 --> 13:37.392
going to your school much longer.

13:39.508 --> 13:41.911
What the hell?
I made that light.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.710
Oh, geez. Another ticket.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.131
Henry's mom drove a tank!

13:46.200 --> 13:48.587
"Henry's mom!" "Henry's mom!"

13:49.703 --> 13:53.101
- What are you doing, Gloria?
- I want to see Henry's mom do this!

13:57.477 --> 13:58.878
Yay! He's chasing us!

13:59.055 --> 14:00.223
This feels like a bad idea.

14:00.292 --> 14:02.120
Okay, too late, because
I'm already committed!

14:02.189 --> 14:03.497
<i>Heart rate... high.</i>

14:03.566 --> 14:05.641
- <i>Heart rate... high.</i>
- What is the plan, Gloria?

14:05.710 --> 14:06.718
We're going to the mall!

14:06.787 --> 14:08.219
You know why I tease you
about your shopping?

14:08.287 --> 14:10.346
Well, you do have a problem.

14:14.148 --> 14:16.235
Okay, get down and don't move.

14:16.632 --> 14:19.798
That's gonna be tough.
I can smell Cinnabon.

14:23.657 --> 14:24.855
Hey!

14:24.933 --> 14:26.618
- Where have you been?
- Oh, hey.

14:26.687 --> 14:28.656
I just stayed in the tank
a little... a little extra.

14:28.724 --> 14:30.093
How... What a great experience.

14:30.162 --> 14:32.454
- Just being alone with yourself...
- Oh, I was never alone.

14:32.522 --> 14:36.007
I-I saw the face of every bully,
I replayed every humiliation...

14:36.076 --> 14:37.561
Is this about "Bett" Davis again?

14:37.671 --> 14:39.568
Okay, we had just watched
"Ruthless People".

14:39.637 --> 14:41.710
You're thinking Midler.
You gotta let it go.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.257
I know. I'm... I'm gonna try.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.469
But... as scared as I was in there,

14:45.538 --> 14:46.733
I kept thinking about how

14:46.812 --> 14:48.727
you're the one person
who makes me feel safe.

14:48.796 --> 14:51.321
And it made me want to be
a better husband

14:51.390 --> 14:54.595
and to be more present,
to be more understanding, to...

14:54.905 --> 14:56.211
Why... Why's your face red?

14:56.280 --> 14:57.719
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

14:57.788 --> 14:59.573
Oh, just probably 'cause
of the toxins, you know...

14:59.641 --> 15:01.548
And your arms, too,
but only up to the...

15:01.977 --> 15:03.078
You have a farmer's tan.

15:03.147 --> 15:04.322
What have I told you
about that expression?

15:04.390 --> 15:05.891
- I can say it...
- Oh, my...

15:06.343 --> 15:09.313
T-T-That's why you're burned.
You went Royal watching!

15:09.382 --> 15:11.189
I was only gonna stay for
a second, but George Brett...

15:11.257 --> 15:12.778
George... George Brett cornered me.

15:12.847 --> 15:14.977
And you know how I am
with famous people. I can't say "No".

15:15.045 --> 15:17.344
Remember when I spent
the entire day at the pool

15:17.413 --> 15:18.328
with Downtown Julie Brown?

15:18.397 --> 15:19.899
You shamed me into coming here

15:19.968 --> 15:22.777
only to leave me soaking
in a bowl of trauma soup?

15:22.846 --> 15:24.226
Okay, whoa, whoa.
W-What happened about be...

15:24.295 --> 15:25.349
being more understanding?

15:25.418 --> 15:27.301
I can't believe you're turning
this into my fault.

15:27.370 --> 15:28.514
This is so like you, Cam.

15:28.583 --> 15:29.655
Hello, again.

15:29.761 --> 15:32.548
Please follow me
to your guided silent meditation.

15:34.214 --> 15:35.548
Before we begin,

15:35.624 --> 15:38.078
the chef has asked me
to reassure everyone

15:38.147 --> 15:40.061
that there's nothing wrong
with the tempeh.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.427
It's supposed to taste that way.

15:43.260 --> 15:44.380
Alright.

15:44.647 --> 15:46.730
Deep breath. In through the nose.

15:46.970 --> 15:48.427
Out through the mouth.

15:48.865 --> 15:52.005
Only in silence
can we be truly present.

15:52.413 --> 15:53.708
But be prepared...

15:53.882 --> 15:56.203
errant feelings may arise.

15:56.272 --> 15:59.827
Anxiety, doubt, anger...

16:00.155 --> 16:03.110
Now, take a breath
and let those feelings pass

16:03.179 --> 16:05.132
like clouds in the sky.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.163
The tension is melting away.

16:08.263 --> 16:09.343
That's it.

16:09.539 --> 16:14.600
Live in this moment of serenity
and stillness.

16:15.296 --> 16:17.570
We're so accustomed to

16:17.741 --> 16:21.839
going, going, going.
But we need to just stop.

16:22.137 --> 16:25.633
Ask yourself the important questions.

16:26.304 --> 16:29.191
Are you running away
from difficult feelings?

16:30.825 --> 16:33.881
Are you holding on to petty grievances?

16:35.452 --> 16:38.350
Are you being the best you?

16:40.124 --> 16:43.321
It's not too late to find your way back.

16:43.466 --> 16:44.533
To the light,

16:44.796 --> 16:46.916
to forgiveness,

16:47.501 --> 16:48.900
to love.

16:50.062 --> 16:51.230
It was amazing.

16:51.337 --> 16:52.531
There were no words,

16:52.610 --> 16:54.375
but I could feel Cam

16:54.444 --> 16:56.507
taking full responsibility
for our fight.

16:56.608 --> 16:59.686
Total silence,
but Mitchell's eyes said,

16:59.898 --> 17:01.051
"It's all on me".

17:01.120 --> 17:04.050
You know, "I was wrong.
What would I do without you?"

17:04.163 --> 17:05.772
It was a beautiful weekend.

17:05.842 --> 17:08.188
Plus,
George Brett signed my ball.

17:08.257 --> 17:11.008
Oh, "To Cam, all my best wishes,
George Brett.

17:11.077 --> 17:13.968
P.S. We are not done with this"?

17:14.491 --> 17:15.701
Mitchell!

17:15.770 --> 17:17.593
Did you write on my ball?!

17:19.578 --> 17:21.146
Hey, where's Bill?

17:21.271 --> 17:23.098
I don't know.
He's probably outside.

17:23.186 --> 17:25.251
When he gets agitated,
he likes to climb stuff.

17:25.448 --> 17:27.810
That lunch was insane.
Can you believe Mom and Dad?

17:27.924 --> 17:30.647
No, and, uh,
I can't believe you either.

17:30.976 --> 17:32.593
You're so mean to Bill.

17:32.662 --> 17:33.781
What do you have
against hot people?

17:33.849 --> 17:35.472
- What did we ever do to you?
- You lost me.

17:35.540 --> 17:37.272
You're gonna blow it
with that guy,

17:37.445 --> 17:38.773
and he's really nice.

17:38.842 --> 17:40.282
Why do you have to
make him feel so dumb?

17:40.350 --> 17:41.613
Okay, you don't know
what you're talking about.

17:41.681 --> 17:42.929
Oh, yes, I do.

17:43.014 --> 17:45.406
Because it's the same way
you've always treated me.

17:45.475 --> 17:47.076
It sucks.

17:47.382 --> 17:48.911
You know what Arvin never does?

17:49.007 --> 17:50.749
Makes me feel less smart
than him.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.452
So, who cares if Bill's
not a member of Menses?

17:53.554 --> 17:55.555
Look, this is the first
boyfriend you've ever had

17:55.686 --> 17:58.186
that is age appropriate,
employed,

17:58.255 --> 17:59.938
and doesn't look like
he's dying on a ship.

18:00.007 --> 18:01.602
I wouldn't say "boyfriend".

18:01.686 --> 18:03.539
He's more like a guilty pleasure.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.024
Guilty or not, that's the first
time I've ever heard you

18:06.093 --> 18:07.563
describe a guy as a "pleasure".

18:15.312 --> 18:17.181
Bill, I'm sorry!

18:17.287 --> 18:18.454
All good, babe.

18:18.523 --> 18:20.964
You're the one fire I can't put out.

18:21.303 --> 18:23.723
Well, also grease is pretty tricky.

18:25.107 --> 18:26.417
Arvin?

18:27.983 --> 18:29.120
Oh.

18:29.773 --> 18:31.485
Arvin, hi. Are you okay?

18:31.554 --> 18:32.583
Yeah. Oh, yes. Yes.

18:32.652 --> 18:33.735
Um... yes.

18:33.804 --> 18:36.612
I-I-I'm... just a-a little
embarrassed.

18:36.681 --> 18:38.547
We're the ones who should
be embarrassed.

18:38.616 --> 18:41.304
We just made lunch
so tense and weird.

18:41.373 --> 18:42.455
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm...

18:42.524 --> 18:45.733
I'm not terribly adept
at handling failure.

18:46.054 --> 18:49.093
My parents are both
overachieving academics...

18:49.167 --> 18:52.242
a doctor of philosophy
and a doctor of mathematics.

18:52.311 --> 18:54.602
- Wow!
- And Father is a doctor of medicine

18:54.671 --> 18:56.447
and doctor of economics.

18:56.781 --> 18:59.555
I-I'm sorry. I just
need to shake it off.

18:59.624 --> 19:01.436
You know, stiff-upper-lip it.

19:01.554 --> 19:02.594
Yeah, it's fine.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.218
Can we just pretend
it never happened?

19:04.295 --> 19:05.390
No.

19:05.501 --> 19:07.376
No, failure sucks.

19:08.045 --> 19:09.380
It's okay to feel bad.

19:09.491 --> 19:11.850
Yeah, wallow a little.
Eat some ice cream.

19:11.937 --> 19:14.581
Day drink, that's how you
come out the other side.

19:14.765 --> 19:17.504
You're... You're like
the inverse of my parents.

19:17.984 --> 19:19.291
Except the drinking.

19:19.443 --> 19:21.238
They're pickled most of the day.

19:21.307 --> 19:23.401
Well, you're not in their house.

19:23.936 --> 19:26.229
This is House Dunphy... We fail here.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.406
Right. I mean,
today our whole goal

19:28.475 --> 19:30.165
was to impress you.
We made fools of ourselves.

19:30.233 --> 19:32.571
I have a magic shop that's
bleeding money... thousands.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.737
- What?
- It's fine.

19:33.806 --> 19:34.954
Hey, what's all this, then?

19:35.023 --> 19:37.929
Oh, whoa. Did I get that from you?
Am I becoming Madonna?

19:37.998 --> 19:40.327
Your parents were actually
being quite lovely.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.663
Thank you for taking the time.

19:43.780 --> 19:46.750
Oh, and my parents' walls
may be adorned

19:46.819 --> 19:48.922
with nothing but
degrees and awards,

19:48.991 --> 19:53.694
but... they don't have one tenth
of your emotional intelligence.

19:53.780 --> 19:55.405
- Aww!
- Thank you.

19:55.913 --> 19:58.811
- But would you say it's an absolutel...
- If you had to pick a winner...

19:58.880 --> 20:00.740
- Okay, stop it.
- Just...

20:03.022 --> 20:04.395
That was so fun.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.063
My heart is racing.

20:06.132 --> 20:08.710
You?
My watch dialed my cardiologist.

20:08.835 --> 20:10.969
I've never run
from the cops before.

20:11.038 --> 20:12.165
Me either.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.022
Lights!

20:14.882 --> 20:18.027
I can't wait to tell everyone
how cool you guys are!

20:18.350 --> 20:19.793
We're not cool, Joe.

20:20.054 --> 20:22.399
That's not what people do
when a policeman pulls them over.

20:22.468 --> 20:24.376
In fact, there's
nothing cool about us.

20:24.445 --> 20:25.922
Well, I don't think
we should be lumped into...

20:25.990 --> 20:27.335
Lights!

20:28.025 --> 20:30.452
Joe, there are more important
things than being cool.

20:30.569 --> 20:31.976
Uh, like what?

20:32.045 --> 20:34.016
Look, the point is, Joe,
we love you too much

20:34.085 --> 20:36.776
to let you think dumb moves
like this are okay.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.929
So, what do we do now?

20:40.225 --> 20:42.220
We're gonna do the right thing.

20:47.361 --> 20:48.741
Officer!

20:49.194 --> 20:50.397
Uh...

20:55.027 --> 20:56.647
Where's Cinnabon?

20:58.499 --> 21:01.631
Sure enough, they call me out
for using too much pine tar.

21:01.708 --> 21:05.046
I run out there and just go
berserk on these umpires.

21:05.115 --> 21:06.382
- But everybody remembers...
- Ugh!

21:06.450 --> 21:07.895
- Watch out. That's a base.
- Yeah.

21:07.964 --> 21:09.180
- That's third base.
- Third base.

21:09.248 --> 21:10.587
That's where I used to play.
You remember that?

21:10.655 --> 21:12.005
Yeah. Should we do...

21:12.270 --> 21:13.905
So, when you would stand here,

21:14.100 --> 21:16.242
you would just kind of basically
be in an athletic...

21:16.311 --> 21:17.653
- I played college football...
- You would get

21:17.721 --> 21:19.166
- like this and say,
- right here

21:19.235 --> 21:20.651
"Please don't hit it to me".

21:21.033 --> 21:22.754
That's how I feel!

21:22.923 --> 21:24.686
I'm gonna get you back!
