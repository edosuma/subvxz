00:03.602 --> 00:06.137
I just love that new
Other Realm Grocery.

00:06.138 --> 00:08.206
Yeah. If there are more
than three people in line,

00:08.207 --> 00:10.008
they just clone
the cashier.

00:10.009 --> 00:11.243
What'd you
bring us?

00:11.244 --> 00:13.478
Honey Frosted Fruity
Cocoa Sugar Clumps.

00:13.479 --> 00:14.579
Made with real candy.

00:14.580 --> 00:17.048
But I asked for
something sweet.

00:17.049 --> 00:19.217
And for you:
Bubble gum?

00:19.218 --> 00:21.186
So this is all part
of a nutritious breakfast.

SALEM:
I don't believe it.

00:22.554 --> 00:24.456
Send in just 500 box tops

00:24.457 --> 00:28.360
and get a genuine replica
of the <i>Epsilon III,</i> free.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.628
Will anyone join me
in saying, "Who cares?"

00:30.629 --> 00:33.397
The <i>Epsilon III</i> was
the first spaceship ever used

00:33.398 --> 00:35.132
in an Other Realm
Earth landing.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.101
I must have that spaceship.

00:37.102 --> 00:40.272
Well, it'll take 500 boxes,
and you're a cat without a job.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.641
Then I'd better
start crunching.

00:42.642 --> 00:44.108
I've never had
Other Realm gum before.

00:44.109 --> 00:45.343
This grape
is pretty good.

00:45.344 --> 00:46.678

pretty loud.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.590
So have you come up with
any suggestions

01:32.591 --> 01:35.293
on how to spend the money
the alumni board donated?

01:35.294 --> 01:37.629
How about a candy machine
in the cafeteria?

01:37.630 --> 01:39.030
We already have one.

01:39.031 --> 01:40.398
Well, I'm good then.

01:40.399 --> 01:42.367
I suggested a poetry bash.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.002
We could have
an after-school coffee shop

01:44.003 --> 01:45.503
where kids can come
read their poetry,

01:45.504 --> 01:47.838
and we could have famous poets
come read their work.

01:47.839 --> 01:50.642
Cool.
So they're not all dead?

01:52.878 --> 01:55.713
If they can build a replica
of the <i>Epsilon III,</i>

01:55.714 --> 01:58.849
you'd think they could make
scissors a cat could use.

01:58.850 --> 02:02.086
Salem, I need your help
with a bow.

02:02.087 --> 02:04.422
Where did all this cereal
come from?

02:04.423 --> 02:07.425
The good things
in nature?

02:07.426 --> 02:09.592
Okay. I kind of told
the manufacturers

02:09.594 --> 02:11.329
I found a rat
in one of their boxes,

02:11.330 --> 02:13.564
and they sent me
ten free ones.

02:13.565 --> 02:16.033
What? Salem, no more lies.

02:16.034 --> 02:17.201
Yes'm.

Salem, these just
came for you.

to exchange gifts

02:33.653 --> 02:34.619

02:34.620 --> 02:36.354
It's for Willard.

our two-month anniversary.

Wow. It's so great
that you two

02:42.494 --> 02:44.662
have stayed together
for two whole months.

02:44.663 --> 02:46.030
I know.

02:46.031 --> 02:49.334
You know, there's a sweet, kind,
intellectual side to Willard,

02:49.335 --> 02:51.135
that he almost never shows.

02:51.136 --> 02:53.471
Yeah. Usually
he's just a big jackass.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.309
You know, Sabrina,
I've been working on a poem.

Sure.

Your suggestions on
how to spend the alumni money

03:20.966 --> 03:23.300
were surpassed
in their dullness

03:23.301 --> 03:26.571
only by their lack
of grammatical accuracy.

03:26.572 --> 03:29.674
In fact, the only one that had
any merit was the suggestion

liked "poetry bash,"
submitted by Sabrina Spellman.

how awful Willard really is.

Then she'll break up with him,
and he can get back

That's perfect.

like a polka bandleader."

Hi. Sorry to just
drop in like this,

08:40.284 --> 08:41.585
but Sabrina left school

08:41.586 --> 08:43.688
before they announced
the winner of the campaign.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.990
Oh, she won and you wanted
to congratulate her?

08:45.991 --> 08:47.325
No, sadly.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.493
She lost,
and I thought I should be

08:49.494 --> 08:50.628
the one to tell her.

08:50.629 --> 08:53.164
How thoughtful.
I'll see if she's here.

Leona Helmsley is here.

Oh, that was close.

someone's gotta tell her

that she's got mustard
on her cheek.

Mm?

Excuse me.

Can we go again?
Huh? Huh? Can we? Huh?

09:31.436 --> 09:32.537
What happened?

09:32.538 --> 09:34.739
Well, we flew up
Libby's nose

09:34.740 --> 09:37.108
and apparently
crashed in her brain.

something <i>unusual</i> happened.

Hey, look. There's Libby's eye.

10:13.045 --> 10:16.214
It's the window to whatever
she has instead of a soul.

10:16.215 --> 10:17.848
Oh, no. She's leaving.

10:17.849 --> 10:18.783
We gotta get out of here.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.453
Hey!
SALEM: I just remembered.

10:22.454 --> 10:24.121
Magic can't be
transmitted

10:24.122 --> 10:26.424
by a witch
from inside a mortal brain.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.225
How do you know that?
I saw a special about this

10:28.226 --> 10:30.227
on the Witches'
Discovery Channel.

10:30.228 --> 10:33.230
So witches get stuck
in mortal brains a lot?

10:33.231 --> 10:35.533
Not as much as
the witch media hypes it,

10:35.534 --> 10:37.568
but it does happen.

10:37.569 --> 10:39.037
Oh, Mrs. Quick.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.137
Have you seen Willard?

10:40.138 --> 10:42.440
Oh, no, but, uh,
just follow the sound

10:42.441 --> 10:44.174
of unwarranted hostility

10:44.175 --> 10:45.776
and you're sure
to find him.

10:48.213 --> 10:50.147
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

10:51.717 --> 10:53.785
Oh, Zelda.

10:53.786 --> 10:56.554
( tinny ):
<i>How wonderful to see you.</i>

10:56.555 --> 10:58.221
<i>Are you ready</i>
<i>for the rally?</i>

10:59.891 --> 11:02.360
I'm glad we arrived
in Libby's brain early.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.662
We got really good seats.

11:04.663 --> 11:07.231
Look at this. I found
a radio in the spaceship.

11:07.232 --> 11:08.732
Maybe we could call
someone for help.

11:08.733 --> 11:10.801
Do you think
Mighty Mouse is free?

11:10.802 --> 11:13.070
Oh, what am I saying?

11:13.071 --> 11:15.339
It'll only do us some good
if someone has the receiver.

11:15.340 --> 11:18.176
The receiver's probably still
in the box of cereal.

11:19.678 --> 11:22.280
Help! Somebody!

11:22.281 --> 11:23.247
<i>Anybody!</i>

11:25.417 --> 11:28.352
( breaking up ):
<i>Help! Help!</i>

11:32.224 --> 11:34.658
Hello? Hello?
<i>Aunt Hilda?</i>

11:34.659 --> 11:37.494
It's Sabrina. Salem and I
are in Libby's brain.

11:37.495 --> 11:39.530
I would have picked Aruba,
but okay.

11:39.531 --> 11:40.965
<i>No, we're trapped.</i>

11:40.966 --> 11:43.201
We were in Salem's toy spaceship
and we flew up her nose.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.602
If there had been boogers
involved,

11:44.603 --> 11:46.236
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

11:46.237 --> 11:48.605
I can't use magic to penetrate
a mortal's brain.

11:48.606 --> 11:50.074
I just saw something
about this

11:50.075 --> 11:51.475
on the Witches'
Discovery Channel.

11:51.476 --> 11:53.243
Wasn't that
a good show?

11:53.244 --> 11:55.012
Now aren't you glad
we got cable?

11:55.013 --> 11:56.814
<i>Yeah, but the Sci-fi Channel's</i>
<i>a rip-off.</i>

11:56.815 --> 11:59.016
Hey,
I'm in a brain here.

11:59.017 --> 12:00.518
Aunt Hilda,
what are we gonna do?

12:00.519 --> 12:02.820
I suggest
we send out for dim sum.

12:02.821 --> 12:04.855
<i>Don't worry, Sabrina.</i>
<i>I'll get one of Zelda's books</i>

12:04.856 --> 12:06.023
on the mortal brain.

12:06.024 --> 12:07.791
Good thing we ordered
that <i>Time-Life</i> series.

12:07.792 --> 12:08.792
Don't go anywhere.

12:08.793 --> 12:09.727
Where are we gonna go,

12:09.728 --> 12:12.129
a day trip
through the gallbladder?

12:19.304 --> 12:21.639
Hi, honey, I'd love
to stay here with you,

12:21.640 --> 12:23.841
but, uh,
I've gotta give my speech.

12:23.842 --> 12:24.842
Wish me luck.

12:24.843 --> 12:26.177
ZELDA:
<i>Try not to throw up.</i>

12:26.178 --> 12:27.678
<i>Try not to throw up!</i>

12:29.681 --> 12:31.515
Harvey,

12:31.516 --> 12:33.450
if thee worships
at mine feet,

12:33.451 --> 12:35.419
thine will buy thee
a hoagie.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.654
Have you seen Sabrina?

12:37.823 --> 12:39.957
I stopped by her house
to console her

12:39.958 --> 12:41.492
after that horrible defeat.

12:41.493 --> 12:44.195
She was wearing a housecoat
and eating Cheez Doodles.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.730
I had to look away.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.899
I don't even own
a housecoat.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.667
We have Cheez Doodles?

12:49.668 --> 12:51.368
LIBBY:
Is that new cologne?

12:51.369 --> 12:55.005
Hey! I am the only one
allowed to smell Harvey!

12:56.575 --> 12:58.208
My fault.

12:58.209 --> 13:01.045
My aftershave gives
my mom a headache too.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.013
I got it free
when I bought tires.

13:04.282 --> 13:05.615
"...trapped in belly button,

13:05.616 --> 13:07.084
bile duct..."

13:07.085 --> 13:08.752
Here we go. "Brain."

13:09.755 --> 13:11.656
Uh, breaker, breaker.

13:11.657 --> 13:13.558
This is
Kitchen Mama calling.

13:13.559 --> 13:14.825
<i>What do you want</i>
<i>your handle to be?</i>

13:14.826 --> 13:15.993
( annoyed ):
Aunt Hilda.

13:15.994 --> 13:17.595
Okay. Aunt Hilda,

13:17.596 --> 13:18.929
I found a way
for you to get out,

13:18.930 --> 13:19.963
and it's so easy.

13:19.964 --> 13:21.098
How?

13:21.099 --> 13:22.667
<i>You just go out</i>
<i>the way you came in.</i>

13:22.668 --> 13:23.734
You have to
make Libby sneeze.

13:23.735 --> 13:25.402
How?
<i>I have no idea,</i>

13:25.403 --> 13:28.005
but it's gotta be easier
than the other option:

13:28.006 --> 13:29.540
kicking a hole
through her temples.

13:29.541 --> 13:31.241
Thanks. Even though
we're basically doomed

13:31.242 --> 13:32.276
you've been a big help.

13:32.277 --> 13:33.377
<i>Well, I'll keep looking.</i>

13:33.378 --> 13:35.213
And, um,
speaking of looking,

13:35.214 --> 13:38.682
have you seen, uh,
Zelda and Willard anywhere?

13:38.683 --> 13:39.950
Hello?

13:40.952 --> 13:42.086
Okay.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.754
How can we
make Libby sneeze?

13:43.755 --> 13:44.688
Pepper?

13:44.689 --> 13:46.891
I bet dim sum
has pepper in it.

13:46.892 --> 13:47.791
Let's think, okay?

13:47.792 --> 13:49.326
We're in her brain,

13:49.327 --> 13:52.029
and the brain controls
everything a person does,

13:52.030 --> 13:53.630
so maybe
if we just stimulate

13:53.631 --> 13:55.065
the right part
of the brain tissue,

13:55.066 --> 13:56.734
we can make her sneeze!

13:57.970 --> 13:59.236
Gross, gross, gross.

13:59.237 --> 14:00.604
Or kill her.

14:00.605 --> 14:01.972
Did we do anything to her?

14:01.973 --> 14:04.141
Everything seems A-okay.

14:04.142 --> 14:06.076
( <i>tribal drum theme playing</i> )

14:11.683 --> 14:13.216
Ew. Ugh!

14:15.821 --> 14:18.289
( students applauding )

14:18.290 --> 14:19.923
So as you can see,

14:19.924 --> 14:22.626
the alumni money
was well spent.

14:22.627 --> 14:23.827
And now,

14:23.828 --> 14:25.529
the girl who puts

14:25.530 --> 14:27.365
the cheer in leader,

14:27.366 --> 14:29.900
the pep in rally...

14:29.901 --> 14:33.070
ZELDA:
<i>Lordy, love a duck,</i>
<i>what's he wearing?</i>

14:33.071 --> 14:37.341
...your queen and mine,
Libby Chessler.

14:37.342 --> 14:39.910
( applause )

14:39.911 --> 14:42.613
<i>Why is he allowed to live?</i>

14:42.614 --> 14:45.816
Ugh. I'm not touching anything
until I hear from Aunt Hilda.

14:45.817 --> 14:47.218
Then you'll want to avoid...

14:47.219 --> 14:48.151
Whoa!

14:49.421 --> 14:50.721
...that veiny thing.

14:50.722 --> 14:53.524
Help! I'm blind!

14:53.525 --> 14:55.692
What's the matter, Libby?
You don't like your new throne?

14:58.129 --> 15:00.030
ZELDA:
<i>Dear Willard,</i>
<i>I'm breaking up with you</i>

15:00.031 --> 15:02.066
<i>because you dress</i>
<i>like an imbecile.</i>

15:02.067 --> 15:04.168
<i>No. Too harsh.</i>

15:04.169 --> 15:07.337
<i>Dear Willard,</i>
<i>you repulse me.</i>

15:07.338 --> 15:08.839
Stick it back.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.040
Ugh. I'm trying.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.175
Gross, gross, gross.

15:14.579 --> 15:16.313
Thank you.
Ah!

15:16.314 --> 15:19.850
I'll never bear false witness
against Fluffy again.

15:21.119 --> 15:23.087
Oh, no.
Libby's dimming.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.956
( students laughing )

15:25.957 --> 15:27.358
Miss Chessler,

15:27.359 --> 15:30.094
are you mocking the
noble institution of homecoming?

15:30.095 --> 15:33.330
Sabrina, you might wanna
try again with the slimy thing.

15:33.331 --> 15:34.598
If we get out of this alive,

15:34.599 --> 15:36.400
you're never
having cereal again.

15:38.636 --> 15:41.038
Hey. Miss Chessler.

15:41.039 --> 15:41.939
Hey!

15:42.907 --> 15:44.908
<i>You go, girl.</i>

15:44.909 --> 15:46.376
Left! Try left!

15:48.747 --> 15:49.814
SALEM:
Too far.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.083
Mayday!
Mayday, Kitchen Mama!

15:52.084 --> 15:54.184
Okay.
I think I found something.

15:54.185 --> 15:56.887
Hurry! Libby won't stop
slapping Mr. Kraft.

15:56.888 --> 15:58.322
Really?

15:58.323 --> 15:59.556
You moved it too far.

15:59.557 --> 16:01.758
Now she's kissing him
again.

16:01.759 --> 16:03.593
Okay.
Here's what you have to do.

16:03.594 --> 16:05.062
Find the main synapse.

16:05.063 --> 16:08.231
It should be the, uh, large,
dangling, dripping thing

16:08.232 --> 16:09.299
<i>right over your head.</i>

16:09.300 --> 16:11.068
It's large, it's dangling...

16:11.069 --> 16:12.770
Yeah. That's it.
<i>Okay.</i>

16:12.771 --> 16:15.806
Now run it through
your own brain.

16:15.807 --> 16:19.476
Then you will be able to control
Libby's thoughts and actions.

16:19.477 --> 16:20.677
How's it working?

16:20.678 --> 16:24.014
Salem, it looks like
we might never leave here.

16:24.015 --> 16:26.950
Libby is twitching
like a Central Park squirrel.

16:26.951 --> 16:28.551
You have to do it.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.824
Ugh. I'll wash,
but I'll never be clean.

16:37.095 --> 16:39.330
( synapse buzzing )

16:39.331 --> 16:40.598
Did it work?

16:40.599 --> 16:41.732
Did it work?

16:41.733 --> 16:42.799
Did what work?

16:42.800 --> 16:44.601
Uh, my attempt to show

16:44.602 --> 16:45.870
how the world would be

16:45.871 --> 16:47.871
if there were no
homecoming queens.

16:47.872 --> 16:50.040
What, the whole world
would start hitting me?

16:51.076 --> 16:52.742
Libby, they're waiting
for your speech.

16:54.879 --> 16:58.415
I think you've got
to walk for the girl.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.217
( synapse whirring )

17:04.422 --> 17:06.522
Reunited with my love.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.394
How about
a little kissy-poo, hm?

17:10.395 --> 17:11.261
( kissing noises )

17:12.531 --> 17:13.797
Get away from me!

17:13.798 --> 17:14.897
Ew!

17:19.137 --> 17:20.938
Okay. Speech time.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.039
Make it a good one.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.574
I just realized something.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.176
...realized something.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.845
I hope you've got
somewhere to go from there.

17:28.846 --> 17:30.581
( synapse buzzes )

17:30.582 --> 17:31.982
I just realized
that I can make Libby

17:31.983 --> 17:33.250
say anything I want.

17:33.251 --> 17:35.386
I can make her admit
that she bought the election

17:35.387 --> 17:36.987
and that we should be having
a poetry bash

17:36.988 --> 17:38.389
instead of
a new homecoming throne.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.790
I can change her.

17:39.791 --> 17:42.393
HILDA:
<i>Sabrina, did you</i>
<i>make Libby sneeze yet?</i>

17:42.394 --> 17:45.529
Sneeze, schmeeze. I got
more important things to do.

17:45.530 --> 17:46.797
( synapse buzzes )

17:46.798 --> 17:50.301
I wanna thank everyone
who voted for me.

17:50.302 --> 17:51.902
It's really an honor.

17:51.903 --> 17:55.372
But the alumni money
really should have gone to...

17:55.373 --> 17:57.174
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )

17:58.109 --> 17:59.042
Do it.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.444
Say it and let's go home.

18:00.445 --> 18:02.446
What are you waiting for?

18:02.447 --> 18:03.614
( synapse gurgles )

18:03.615 --> 18:05.249
I can't.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.917
The change has to come
from inside Libby.

18:06.918 --> 18:09.019
We <i>are</i> inside Libby.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.354
We won't be forever.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.456
I'd just be
manipulating her.

18:12.457 --> 18:15.525
We can't change her for good
unless she wants to change.

18:17.162 --> 18:20.230
I know it's hard to do
the right thing, Libby,

18:20.231 --> 18:22.065
but we're with you.

18:22.066 --> 18:23.534
( synapse buzzes )

18:23.535 --> 18:25.569
Libby, you were
about to make

18:25.570 --> 18:28.506
a grand and
generous gesture.

18:28.507 --> 18:29.372
( scoffs )

18:29.373 --> 18:30.874
I don't think so.

18:32.643 --> 18:36.313
Okay. I know you're sad
that you can't change Libby,

18:36.314 --> 18:38.882
but I have
worse news.

18:38.883 --> 18:41.251
I have to go to
the bathroom.

18:41.252 --> 18:43.887
Let's make the girl sneeze.

18:43.888 --> 18:46.323
I have an idea.

18:46.324 --> 18:48.625
I'm betting
that this leads to the sinuses.

18:48.626 --> 18:50.761
And I hope that leads
to a point.

18:50.762 --> 18:54.131
Well, if we can just put
an irritant into the sinuses,

18:54.132 --> 18:55.866
maybe we can
make Libby sneeze.

18:55.867 --> 18:58.302
And since many people
are allergic to...

18:58.303 --> 18:59.570
No!

18:59.571 --> 19:01.338
As your queen,

19:01.339 --> 19:03.273
I promise to be...

19:03.274 --> 19:04.542
beautiful.

19:06.043 --> 19:07.010
( sniffles )

19:07.011 --> 19:10.347
No! Gross,
gross, gross.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.650
She's gonna blow!

19:12.651 --> 19:13.684
To the ship.

19:17.556 --> 19:18.889
Ah-choo!

19:18.890 --> 19:21.091
We're out.
We're in the gym.

19:21.092 --> 19:23.159
( both screaming )

19:27.732 --> 19:29.666
There goes my knee.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.370
If that's anything
like a hairball,

19:33.371 --> 19:34.638
he should eat
some grass.

19:34.639 --> 19:35.772
Bring it right up.

19:35.773 --> 19:36.973
Shh!

19:36.974 --> 19:37.841
Gmp.

19:39.310 --> 19:42.345
I think I swallowed
my gum.

19:42.346 --> 19:43.847
Was I chewing gum?

19:43.848 --> 19:46.116
Sabrina, where
have you been?

19:46.117 --> 19:47.684
I heard you
were boycotting.

19:47.685 --> 19:50.120
No, I just had to bring
my cat to Libby's brain.

19:51.389 --> 19:53.223
I mean the vet. Pfft.

19:53.224 --> 19:54.458
Gotta go.

19:54.459 --> 19:55.292
ZELDA:
Go away, Willard.

19:55.293 --> 19:56.360
KRAFT:
But, Zelda...

19:56.361 --> 19:57.294
Oh, this is sweet.

19:58.229 --> 19:59.496
You are the most
annoying man

19:59.497 --> 20:01.465
I have ever met
in my entire life.

20:01.466 --> 20:03.199
I never want
to hear you, see you,

20:03.200 --> 20:05.702
or in any way sense you,
ever again.

20:05.703 --> 20:07.137
KRAFT:
Okay.

20:07.138 --> 20:08.939
I am getting the feeling
that you are upset.

20:08.940 --> 20:09.806
Oh!

20:09.807 --> 20:12.009
Look. At least let me give you

20:12.010 --> 20:13.743
our anniversary present.

20:13.744 --> 20:16.980
But you already gave me one,
remember? The chocolates.

20:16.981 --> 20:19.449
You gave them to Hilda,
and Hilda ga--

20:19.450 --> 20:21.418
Hilda gave them to me.

20:21.419 --> 20:22.519
Gotta go.

20:24.189 --> 20:25.222
Be careful with that.

20:25.223 --> 20:26.723
It-- It was on sale.

20:26.724 --> 20:28.359
Can't return it.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.926
Why is everyone
looking at me

20:29.927 --> 20:31.428
like I'm a weirdo?

20:31.429 --> 20:33.697
I'm telling you, the throne
made me do those things.

20:33.698 --> 20:34.832
It's evil!

20:34.833 --> 20:37.234
And it's
poorly upholstered.

20:38.235 --> 20:39.803
Take it away.

20:41.373 --> 20:42.438
Well, I guess
this means

20:42.439 --> 20:44.608
you can have your
poetry bash after all.

20:44.609 --> 20:46.409
Libby's the same
mean person,

20:46.410 --> 20:48.244
but things
still worked out.

20:48.245 --> 20:49.380
Well,
this is great,

20:49.381 --> 20:50.981
'cause I wrote
a new poem.

20:50.982 --> 20:52.382
Oh, and I'd love
to hear it.

20:52.383 --> 20:53.384
( clears throat )

20:53.385 --> 20:54.384
<i>Popcorn dance--</i>

20:54.385 --> 20:55.419
( fire alarm ringing )

20:55.420 --> 20:56.787
Oh, uh, single file.

20:56.788 --> 20:59.523
Grab a buddy.

20:59.524 --> 21:02.258
We've never had a fire
drill <i>after</i> school.

21:02.259 --> 21:04.161
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

21:07.798 --> 21:09.132
<i>...where the women</i>
<i>come and go,</i>

21:09.133 --> 21:12.536
<i>talking of early-bird</i>
<i>specials at Coco's.</i>

21:12.537 --> 21:14.071
<i>O Westbridge,</i>
<i>you tempt me</i>

21:14.072 --> 21:16.039
<i>with your soft</i>
<i>spring mornings,</i>

21:16.040 --> 21:18.575
<i>your grease-saturated</i>
<i>clam cakes,</i>

21:18.576 --> 21:20.177
<i>your bread-crumb</i>
<i>coatings...</i>

21:20.178 --> 21:23.814
<i>Through love's torturous path</i>
<i>I have wandered,</i>

21:23.815 --> 21:26.150
<i>only to find</i>
<i>the happiness</i>

21:26.151 --> 21:28.018
<i>I have</i>
<i>longed for.</i>

21:28.019 --> 21:29.887
<i>I have laid bare</i>
<i>my heart...</i>

21:29.888 --> 21:30.954
STUDENT: Oh!
Hey.

21:30.955 --> 21:32.222
I saw that!

21:33.925 --> 21:35.993
Good arm,
Miss Angelou.
