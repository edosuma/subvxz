00:01.187 --> 00:03.612
Hey, Charles, can we talk in
the briefing room for a sec?

00:03.648 --> 00:05.412
- There's a question I gotta ask you.
- Mm-hmm.

00:08.243 --> 00:10.219
It's happening.

00:10.255 --> 00:11.750
Jake is gonna pop the question.

00:11.786 --> 00:13.885
- He's gonna ask me to be his BM.
- Both: No.

00:13.921 --> 00:15.816
BM, best man, is a common abbreviation.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.785
No one but you has ever used it.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.322
I am so relieved.

00:19.358 --> 00:21.394
I thought maybe he was gonna
ask one of Amy's brothers

00:21.430 --> 00:22.698
or, ugh, Sarge.

00:22.734 --> 00:24.525
- Hey, man, come on.
- Charles!

00:24.558 --> 00:27.061
[mouthing]

00:27.981 --> 00:31.199
Okay, so I know this is a lot to ask...

00:31.232 --> 00:32.500
No, it's not. I want to do it.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.086
You want to cover my shift this weekend

00:34.122 --> 00:35.472
so I can go to the White Plains Mall

00:35.508 --> 00:37.550
and meet Darryl Strawberry at the
opening of a cellphone store?

00:38.315 --> 00:39.407
Yes.

00:39.674 --> 00:41.474
It's exactly what I was hoping
you'd ask.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.644
Great. Thanks. You sure it's okay?

00:43.677 --> 00:45.446
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.776
I'm very happy about it.
It'll be fun. It'll be fun.

00:47.812 --> 00:50.165
Uh, look at my smile. Have to go now.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.321
All: Surprise!

00:53.354 --> 00:55.289
Oh, my God!

00:55.323 --> 00:57.137
- Jake!
- What do you say, bud?

00:57.173 --> 01:00.738
- Will you be my BM?
- Yes! Yes, a million times, yes!

01:01.082 --> 01:02.569
In your face, Terry!

01:02.605 --> 01:04.119
What? I'm holding a sparkler for you.

01:04.155 --> 01:05.633
I helped organize a lot of this.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.413
Well, you can stick that
sparkler up your butt.

01:07.449 --> 01:08.950
I'm the best man!

01:08.986 --> 01:11.839

01:29.524 --> 01:31.159
Captain, allow me to introduce you

01:31.192 --> 01:34.462
to major East Coast arms dealer
Dan "Daniel" Valdano.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.702
That's right, his nickname is
longer than his actual name.

01:36.738 --> 01:38.773
- Why's that, Terry?
- 'Cause he's a dick.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.700
We got a warrant to bug him,
but his house is a fortress

01:41.736 --> 01:43.270
and he never goes anywhere in public.

01:43.306 --> 01:45.259
Luckily, CI just gave us a break.

01:45.295 --> 01:47.524
Valdano's gonna actually leave his house

01:47.560 --> 01:49.810
to go to a high stakes
poker game this Friday.

01:49.846 --> 01:53.191
If we can get a seat at that table,
we can lose this watch to him.

01:53.227 --> 01:54.542
And guess what. It's...

01:54.578 --> 01:56.502
- Both: Bugged!
- Yes, it's bugged.

01:56.538 --> 01:57.654
Good guess, Captain.

01:57.690 --> 01:59.734
The plan is, we go to the club tonight,

01:59.770 --> 02:03.037
show off our poker skills, and get
an invite to the high stakes game.

02:03.073 --> 02:05.342
All we need is $15,000
to get in the door.

02:05.378 --> 02:06.872
That's a lot of money.
How are your poker skills?

02:06.908 --> 02:08.435
- [blows raspberry]
- A'ight.

02:08.471 --> 02:09.490
- Good.
- A'ight.

02:09.526 --> 02:10.531
- Hecka good.
- A'ight.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.342
- So good.
- Perhaps I should see for myself.

02:12.378 --> 02:14.566
- Oh. Do you play?
- I am...

02:14.905 --> 02:17.119
- A'ight.
- Damn, Cap.

02:17.155 --> 02:19.624
- Are you secretly cool?
- Well, poker is just math,

02:19.660 --> 02:21.175
so I guess it depends on if you consider

02:21.211 --> 02:24.657
the mathematician
Carl Friedrich Gauss cool.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.380
I do not.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.148
All right, let's play some cards.

02:28.184 --> 02:30.065
Sarge asked me to help you
guys with some filing.

02:30.101 --> 02:31.966
Holy crap, this is gonna take all day.

02:32.002 --> 02:34.105
Yup, it's what we call an all-dayer.

02:34.141 --> 02:35.599
How long did it take you two
to come up with that?

02:35.635 --> 02:38.192
- That was a two-dayer.
- Okay, well, hand me some files.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.431
You're not gonna bother
actually walking?

02:43.464 --> 02:45.426
Why should we?
We can work from down here.

02:45.462 --> 02:47.257
I'm sitting down as long as I can.

02:47.293 --> 02:49.537
I'm not getting out of the chair
till it's time to go home.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.273
- Ugh.
- Oh, typical standing elite.

02:52.497 --> 02:54.533
You couldn't sit all day if you tried.

02:54.569 --> 02:58.005
What? You don't think I could
outlast you turds in a chair?

02:58.041 --> 03:00.298
Honey, you don't have the ass for it.

03:01.396 --> 03:02.876
Let's talk terms.

03:02.912 --> 03:05.253
Both cheeks on the cushion at all times.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.692
Obviously. Bathroom breaks?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.136
Two and a half minutes
every three hours.

03:08.172 --> 03:10.054
But you gotta roll the chair
fully into the stall.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.760
- Obviously.
- Okay.

03:15.610 --> 03:17.779
- Let's do this.
- Welcome to the Buttlympics.

03:18.967 --> 03:21.313
I call to order the meeting of investors

03:21.349 --> 03:24.308
in the forthcoming Charles
Boyle owned-and-operated

03:24.344 --> 03:25.967
food truck venture.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.976
I know I'm the only investor,
but is it cool if I take minutes?

03:29.009 --> 03:31.438
Yes. Put this down: we got a truck.

03:31.474 --> 03:33.447
What? Really? That's huge.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.482
Take a look.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.984
Is that the NYPD police auction site?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.452
Yeah, that's how I found out about it.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.721
And there's our baby. Isn't she a...

03:40.754 --> 03:42.142
Murder truck?

03:42.178 --> 03:44.325
That's the truck from the
Tinga Time Taco murders!

03:44.361 --> 03:46.204
Yes, two brothers were
using a taco truck

03:46.240 --> 03:48.148
to move heroin and then were
killed by the cartel

03:48.184 --> 03:50.062
- that supplied them.
- Not just killed, Boyle.

03:50.098 --> 03:51.933
Dismembered. Right in the truck.

03:51.969 --> 03:54.848
Right in our truck. That's
why it was such bargain.

03:54.884 --> 03:58.000
Everyone else was like, "Ooh,
there's a knee in the fryer.

03:58.036 --> 04:00.126
I don't want to sell food out of this."

04:00.162 --> 04:02.730
- They found a knee in the fryer?
- Exactly. You get it.

04:02.766 --> 04:04.661
Well, now I get to go pick it up.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.515
Oh, almost forgot my hazmat suit.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.979
[chuckles]

04:09.450 --> 04:11.805
And... I win again.

04:11.841 --> 04:15.084
Which is not surprising, given
how you are both terrible.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.649
You don't even know the terminology.

04:16.685 --> 04:19.140
- What are you talking about? "Hit me."
- That is blackjack.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.264
- Snake-eyes.
- Craps.

04:20.313 --> 04:21.726
- Go Fish.
- And I believe that is

04:21.762 --> 04:22.902
- Go Fish.
- Fine.

04:22.938 --> 04:24.368
Jake stinks, but I can play.

04:24.404 --> 04:26.944
Yes, but you have a rather
unfortunate tell:

04:26.980 --> 04:28.120
your right breast.

04:28.592 --> 04:31.027
Oh, no. My cards are terrible.

04:31.225 --> 04:32.540
Sure they are.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.131
Dammit, Eugene, you sold me out!

04:34.167 --> 04:35.377
Captain, do I have a tell?

04:35.413 --> 04:36.866
No, you don't understand
the game well enough

04:36.902 --> 04:38.316
- to have a tell.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

04:38.352 --> 04:39.734
What about you? What's your tell?

04:39.770 --> 04:41.917
It is subtle. You will never discern it.

04:41.953 --> 04:44.518
Oh, really? Well, challenge accepted.

04:44.856 --> 04:46.090
Tell me a lie.

04:46.321 --> 04:47.455
You're both great at poker

04:47.488 --> 04:48.693
and I'm not gonna cancel the mission.

04:48.729 --> 04:50.464
Nope, I couldn't see it. Wait, what?

04:50.500 --> 04:51.934
You're cancelling the mission?
You can't do that.

04:51.970 --> 04:53.706
This is our only shot
at catching Valdano.

04:53.742 --> 04:55.244
It's a foolish plan.
Neither of you have any chance

04:55.280 --> 04:56.873
of making it to the VIP table.

04:56.909 --> 04:58.544
But maybe you could. What if you played?

04:58.580 --> 04:59.947
No, I don't gamble anymore.

04:59.983 --> 05:01.802
A few years back I had
a minor addiction,

05:01.835 --> 05:03.688
specifically involving...

05:04.274 --> 05:05.409
the ponies.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.808
I'd like to bet $20,000 on...

05:07.841 --> 05:11.679
Yabba Dabba Doo.

05:11.865 --> 05:13.767
Sadly, Yabba Dabba Doo stumbled

05:13.803 --> 05:15.616
and had to be put down
in front all of us.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.385
- Oh. That's fun.
- Wait.

05:17.637 --> 05:19.806
What if I never went inside the casino?

05:19.842 --> 05:21.355
I could be outside
in a surveillance van,

05:21.389 --> 05:23.457
telling Peralta what to do.

05:23.493 --> 05:25.288
Smart. That way you never
technically gamble.

05:25.324 --> 05:26.727
- Right.
- I don't know.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.762
Addiction is nothing to
fool around with.

05:28.798 --> 05:31.404
I had food issues.
I ate a crate of hams once.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.700
Yeah, and look at you now.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.104
You're like a super-jacked
He-man guy, right?

05:35.140 --> 05:37.221
It's settled; we'll go with
the captain's plan.

05:38.047 --> 05:41.281
Here's your persona: you're
Billy "Big Time" Jankowski.

05:41.317 --> 05:44.229
You wear sunglasses, headphones,
and an unwashed hoodie.

05:44.393 --> 05:46.072
You normally gamble online,

05:46.108 --> 05:47.870
from your mother's basement,
where you live.

05:47.906 --> 05:49.417
Seems unnecessary.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.419
The hoodie hides your
sunglass-camera's electronics.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.040
I more meant the living in
my mom's basement virgin vibe.

05:54.076 --> 05:57.509
You added the virgin, but I like it.
It's part of your backstory now.

05:57.545 --> 05:59.322
- But...
- You're a virgin. That's an order.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.093
But I don't want to be a virgin again.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.553
Okay, I'm approaching the table.

06:03.748 --> 06:06.178
Evening, gentlemen.
Let's play some cards.

06:06.248 --> 06:07.782
And now, Peralta, say the following...

06:07.818 --> 06:10.738
I'm coming in under the gun,
and I've 15k behind.

06:11.310 --> 06:12.522
Okay.

06:12.947 --> 06:14.282
Action's on you.

06:15.728 --> 06:17.896
Mmm, tasty. Raise it 500.

06:17.932 --> 06:19.447
Raise it 5-hundo.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.614
- Made up my own.
- What?

06:20.648 --> 06:21.889
I'm just talking to myself.

06:21.925 --> 06:23.653
I'm used to playing online,
so it's not weird.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.889
Well, well, well.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.892
You flopped the absolute nuts,
Peralta. Go all in.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.935
Are you sure?
On the first hand, Captain?

06:33.971 --> 06:35.696
It's what the math dictates.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.699
At this moment there are no two
cards that can beat Peralta.

06:38.735 --> 06:40.501
- I'm all in.
- And now they all fold

06:40.534 --> 06:42.887
like so much recently dried linen.

06:42.923 --> 06:44.291
- I'll call.
- What an idiot.

06:44.327 --> 06:45.362
Two players.

06:48.788 --> 06:50.724
- What?
- Full house wins.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.757
- Yes!
- No, he won; not you.

06:52.793 --> 06:54.150
You're out of chips.

06:54.186 --> 06:55.483
Oh, well, that sucks.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.451
Guess I'll just head back
to my mom's basement.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.519
I'm a virgin.

07:01.873 --> 07:04.558
All clear. No poopers.
Repeat: No poopers.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.959
That was a disaster.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.844
I thought Holt was supposed
to be great at this.

07:09.148 --> 07:10.850
- Any poopers?
- All clear.

07:10.886 --> 07:12.098
- What happened, Captain?
- [scoffs]

07:12.134 --> 07:13.667
That imbecile in the trucker hat

07:13.701 --> 07:16.167
hit both his runners and
sucked out on the river.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.571
Yeah, he did. What does that mean?

07:17.607 --> 07:20.774
Not to worry. The odds of that
happening again are infinitesimal.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.810
Not that it matters.
Since we're out of money.

07:22.846 --> 07:24.828
Oh, but we're not.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.987
- Where'd this come from?
- It's my money.

07:28.023 --> 07:29.657
There are 25 ATMs in this place.

07:29.693 --> 07:31.018
Even the fire exit has one.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.887
You want us to use your own money?
You sure that's a good idea?

07:33.921 --> 07:36.564
I haven't placed a bet
or touched a card.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.734
I'm fine.

07:37.776 --> 07:39.212
Technically that is true.

07:39.248 --> 07:41.248
Trust me; the math is in our favor.

07:41.467 --> 07:44.632
All right, let's get back in
there and suck out two runners

07:44.665 --> 07:45.999
down by the river.

07:46.414 --> 07:48.082
- Did I say that right?
- Not even close.

07:48.118 --> 07:49.169
Yeah, I didn't think so.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.704
Still, let's get in there
and suck 'em out.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.924
No time like the present.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.538
And no place to do it like
the men's bathroom,

07:53.574 --> 07:56.176
to leave from here to go do
what we're talking about.

07:56.735 --> 07:59.661
Ugh. Nine hours and 55 minutes.

07:59.697 --> 08:01.449
Is it? I feel like I just sat down.

08:01.485 --> 08:04.079
I have no feeling down there whatsoever.

08:05.232 --> 08:07.467
[groans] I haven't in years.

08:07.503 --> 08:09.344
I'm doing great too.
This has been a piece of ca...

08:09.380 --> 08:11.512
Oh, butt cramp. Butt cramp!

08:11.548 --> 08:12.726
That sounds painful.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.501
I bet you could use some electrolytes.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.466
- Give me that! That's mine.
- Come get it.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.866
You'll never catch me!

08:18.899 --> 08:20.124
Oh, won't I?

08:20.344 --> 08:21.479
Oh!

08:26.066 --> 08:28.175
[exhales deeply] Cramp over.

08:28.589 --> 08:30.007
And so is our shift.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.578
Ha. And you thought I couldn't...
Wait, what are you doing?

08:32.615 --> 08:34.662
You thought we were done just
because our shift was over?

08:34.698 --> 08:36.049
- Amateur.
- Oh.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.650
So you wanna take this thing
into overtime?

08:37.684 --> 08:39.693
Fine. I got no place to be.

08:39.729 --> 08:41.297
Neither do I. I never do.

08:41.332 --> 08:43.724
Then it's agreed. The games continue.

08:44.264 --> 08:46.049
And now you're going to...

08:46.797 --> 08:48.118
- Fold.
- Fold.

08:48.799 --> 08:50.534
- Fold.
- Fold.

08:50.570 --> 08:51.899
- Fold.
- Fold.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.834
Should we consider cutting our losses?

08:53.870 --> 08:56.066
Hush, Sergeant. Our cards are coming.

08:56.338 --> 08:59.671
And there she is.

08:59.707 --> 09:00.789
- You won.
- I won.

09:00.825 --> 09:02.033
- You won!
- Won again.

09:02.069 --> 09:03.435
- That's our straight.
- And again, again.

09:03.471 --> 09:04.800
Hot damn!

09:04.836 --> 09:06.219
Peralta, say "hot damn."

09:06.255 --> 09:08.017
- Hot damn!
- Now you say it.

09:08.203 --> 09:10.005
- Hot damn!
- Full house.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.051
Eights over threes.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.248
Good. Now say to the dealer...

09:13.284 --> 09:15.220
Well, this has been fun.

09:15.256 --> 09:17.057
But I'm sick of playing with...

09:17.090 --> 09:19.026
wittle wittle babies.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.236
Is there a table for people
who wear big boy pants?

09:23.557 --> 09:25.766
Actually, there's
a private game on Friday

09:25.799 --> 09:27.041
I think you might like.

09:29.576 --> 09:30.830
Much obliged.

09:32.366 --> 09:33.941
- Hey, there, bud.
- Hey.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.076
Can we talk about the murder
truck we just purchased

09:36.109 --> 09:37.881
with our very hard-earned money?

09:37.917 --> 09:40.016
Oh, Amy, wait till you see her.

09:40.052 --> 09:42.378
I spent all night pressure-washing her,

09:42.414 --> 09:44.007
and she is spotless.

09:44.043 --> 09:46.165
Yeah, it's just, what if word gets out

09:46.201 --> 09:48.303
that our food truck was
the site of a double homicide?

09:48.342 --> 09:49.640
What if word gets out?

09:49.676 --> 09:52.047
It's in the "Our Story"
section of the menu.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.545
We're calling it Murder Truck!

09:53.581 --> 09:54.803
- We are?
- Yeah!

09:54.839 --> 09:57.748
- It was your idea.
- No, it was my greatest fear.

09:57.784 --> 10:00.250
I can't believe you're leaning
into the murder thing.

10:00.286 --> 10:02.805
Well, it'll get people talking.
Check out the menu.

10:02.841 --> 10:04.851
It's printed on a crime scene photo.

10:04.887 --> 10:06.315
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:06.351 --> 10:08.225
Charles, we're gonna
lose all of our money.

10:08.261 --> 10:09.810
Are you worried?

10:10.047 --> 10:12.433
Oh, okay, I see what's happening.

10:12.469 --> 10:14.748
Starting a business is very scary.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.963
But I promise you,
once you see our truck,

10:18.266 --> 10:20.144
you'll feel a lot better. Come on.

10:21.444 --> 10:24.689
No, no, no, no, no! My truck!
My beautiful truck!

10:24.725 --> 10:25.993
Someone killed ripped her apart!

10:26.026 --> 10:27.483
Charles, please tell me you
got insurance.

10:27.519 --> 10:28.996
- I did.
- Okay, thank God.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.922
Coverage starts tomorrow.

10:32.683 --> 10:34.494
Well, Valdano's gonna be there tonight,

10:34.530 --> 10:37.098
and the recording device in
the watch is transmitting.

10:37.134 --> 10:39.168
I feel like Bond. Terry Bond.

10:39.204 --> 10:41.174
Well, technically I'm the
one wearing the watch,

10:41.210 --> 10:42.843
so that would make you Q at best.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.891
- Terry Q.
- Yeah. Way to roll with it.

10:44.927 --> 10:46.983
Come on, let's tell Holt
we're prepped for tonight.

10:47.019 --> 10:48.818
I gotta say, I was wrong about him.

10:48.854 --> 10:51.118
He had no problem
walking away last night.

10:51.545 --> 10:53.236
He left a lot of hams in that crate.

10:53.272 --> 10:54.354
Juicy.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.168
Spiral-cut, honey-sweet but salty...

10:57.204 --> 10:58.910
- Sarge, come back to me.
- What?

10:58.946 --> 11:00.429
You're the one that brought up ham.

11:00.465 --> 11:03.314
- That was you.
- Holt: Yes, yes, come to papa.

11:03.350 --> 11:06.166
Raise it a grand! Call. Raise.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.502
A pair of candy canes. I'm all in, baby.

11:08.538 --> 11:10.137
- What are you doing, sir?
- Working the case.

11:10.173 --> 11:11.803
Sharpening my poker skills for Valdano.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.875
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, and why are you watching
this children's beauty pageant?

11:14.908 --> 11:16.844
For fun, obviously.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.312
No, Jayla, don't drop the baton.

11:19.632 --> 11:22.068
No, I had so much riding on you!

11:22.104 --> 11:24.640
Oh no. He is deep in the ham crate.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.189
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.163
Captain Holt's been in his
office gambling for hours.

11:31.199 --> 11:32.879
Our only choice is to
cut off his internet.

11:32.915 --> 11:34.925
No, I mean, are you sure
you know how to do that?

11:34.961 --> 11:36.549
Of course. I just have to pull this...

11:36.585 --> 11:37.603
[zap] Oh!

11:37.639 --> 11:39.083
[glass shatters]

11:39.119 --> 11:40.611
- Gah.
- Wrong wire.

11:40.647 --> 11:42.735
Yep, we'll... we'll fix that later.

11:42.771 --> 11:44.171
And...

11:44.548 --> 11:46.555
- Holt: What the hell?
- Got it.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.518
Having trouble with your internet, sir?

11:48.554 --> 11:50.749
He's not here. Where'd he go?

11:50.785 --> 11:51.920
Roof.

11:51.956 --> 11:53.413
What are you doing?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.529
Trying to pick up a Wi-Fi
signal from across the street.

11:55.565 --> 11:58.351
I've got $8,000 riding on little Jayla.

11:58.387 --> 12:00.447
Don't you think you have
a bit of a problem here, sir?

12:00.483 --> 12:02.023
I'm in complete control.

12:02.059 --> 12:04.487
Now, Terry, come over here and dangle me
off the edge of this building.

12:04.523 --> 12:07.394
Sir, I am not going to dangle you
off the side of this building.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.829
You're fired. Peralta, let
me climb onto your shoulders.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.063
- I can't...
- You're fired.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.462
No one works here anymore.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.753
Look, we need to have a real
talk about your gambling.

12:13.789 --> 12:16.011
Relapsing is nothing to be ashamed of.

12:16.047 --> 12:18.514
A couple years ago on my
birthday I treated myself

12:18.550 --> 12:20.073
to one piece of pizza.

12:20.109 --> 12:23.718
I woke up the next morning in a
Sbarro on the Jersey Turnpike.

12:23.754 --> 12:24.937
It wasn't even open!

12:24.973 --> 12:26.346
That's not what's happening here.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.815
I'm not weak like you.
I can stop whenever I want.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.404
- Then stop.
- I don't want.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.678
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:32.714 --> 12:34.837
I'm heading to the acai
bowl internet cafÃ©.

12:34.873 --> 12:38.027
Got a lot of money riding on the NLCS,
whatever the hell that is.

12:38.063 --> 12:39.705
We can't let you do that.

12:39.741 --> 12:42.795
And how exactly will you stop me?

12:44.053 --> 12:45.517
We'll call your husband.

12:46.792 --> 12:47.945
No.

12:48.832 --> 12:51.240
No, I can't put Kevin
through this, not again.

12:51.849 --> 12:53.534
You're right. I've lost control,

12:53.806 --> 12:55.678
and I'm taking myself off this case.

12:55.912 --> 13:00.072
And I'm not going anywhere
near gambling again.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.596
- You promise?
- From the bottom of my heart.

13:04.632 --> 13:05.972
It's a dead issue.

13:06.354 --> 13:07.729
I'm proud of you, sir.

13:07.852 --> 13:09.256
So am I, Captain.

13:10.031 --> 13:12.682
So I'm sorry. Terry,
you went to Jersey for pizza?

13:12.718 --> 13:15.128
- I had a problem, man!
- Right, sorry.

13:15.457 --> 13:18.716
Ugh, how long have we been sitting?
My butt's lost track of time.

13:18.752 --> 13:21.693
- Coming up on 32 hours.
- [sighs] I miss the little things.

13:22.037 --> 13:24.371
Showers. Feeling my feet.

13:24.958 --> 13:26.893
- Standing.
- I miss my home chair.

13:26.929 --> 13:28.013
You miss a chair?

13:28.049 --> 13:30.164
I just want walk up to the
hot dog stand out front

13:30.200 --> 13:31.488
and get a fresh wiener.

13:31.524 --> 13:33.643
Oh, man. Why did you say
that? Now I want one.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.329
- So you should go get one.
- Oh, and let you win?

13:35.365 --> 13:37.003
You're just trying to get us
to stand up.

13:37.039 --> 13:39.501
No. We should all go get one...

13:39.688 --> 13:41.690
- in our chairs.
- She's right.

13:41.726 --> 13:43.961
The only thing holding us
back is society.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.460
[upbeat music]

13:47.494 --> 13:53.300
â™ª

13:53.846 --> 13:55.784
Mmm. So good.

13:56.762 --> 13:58.664
I got it. No.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.033
- My ass.
- It left the chair.

14:01.069 --> 14:02.667
I'm sorry, man.

14:02.941 --> 14:06.079
No. It was my time.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.331
It's our time too.

14:08.367 --> 14:10.941
We've been through hell together.
Now we stand together.

14:10.977 --> 14:12.598
[triumphant music]

14:12.634 --> 14:14.268
Nope. Legs are dead.

14:14.304 --> 14:15.483
Going down.

14:15.519 --> 14:16.987
- [thud]
- [groans]

14:17.384 --> 14:18.642
Charles, what are you doing?

14:18.681 --> 14:20.193
I know having our truck smashed to bits

14:20.227 --> 14:23.123
was a bit of a setback, but
don't worry; I have an idea.

14:23.159 --> 14:25.999
The truck was deconstructed so we do...

14:26.722 --> 14:28.256
Not have a business anymore?

14:28.292 --> 14:30.848
No. We do deconstructed food.

14:30.884 --> 14:33.296
For instance, a deconstructed
meatball sub:

14:33.332 --> 14:35.745
a meatball, rolled in breadcrumbs

14:35.781 --> 14:38.278
with a caramelized tomato sauce drizzle.

14:38.927 --> 14:40.309
- Taste it.
- Charles,

14:40.345 --> 14:42.532
I appreciate that you're trying
to fix this situation,

14:42.568 --> 14:43.747
but you don't have to.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.084
I have great news.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.201
I know who robbed us.

14:46.237 --> 14:48.251
The cartel who did
the taco truck murders

14:48.287 --> 14:50.991
ripped apart the truck, because
there was heroin still inside it.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.213
We found opioid traces
behind the fridge.

14:53.249 --> 14:55.397
I had forensics scour the truck for DNA

14:55.433 --> 14:58.296
and we got a match: a cartel enforcer.

14:58.453 --> 14:59.653
Do you know what this means?

14:59.689 --> 15:01.268
The truck becomes a crime scene again.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.744
Yes! It's been impounded.
We get our money back!

15:04.806 --> 15:05.847
Great.

15:05.950 --> 15:07.819
I'm glad you get your money back.

15:08.197 --> 15:11.241
You can invest it in something
you actually believe in instead of...

15:11.277 --> 15:12.747
My balls.

15:12.783 --> 15:15.353
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have 50 pounds of meat

15:15.389 --> 15:17.819
I have to return before it goes rotten.

15:18.868 --> 15:20.289
Like my dreams.

15:23.542 --> 15:25.733
There's Valdano.
The watch is transmitting.

15:25.769 --> 15:27.670
All you have to do is lose it to him.

15:27.706 --> 15:29.774
- Worst of luck to you.
- Don't worry, Terry.

15:29.810 --> 15:32.032
I'm about to crap the bed.

15:32.386 --> 15:34.738
Evening, gentlemen.
Ready for some poker?

15:34.774 --> 15:37.406
- That's why we're here.
- [laughs] Good one, stranger.

15:37.700 --> 15:38.929
I'll take 150.

15:39.301 --> 15:40.779
Holt: Hot damn!

15:40.931 --> 15:42.091
Four queens.

15:42.127 --> 15:44.921
I call this hand the Golden Girls.

15:44.957 --> 15:47.666
Damn it. Oh, you would look at that.

15:47.702 --> 15:50.562
My mom's calling me.
She's flipping her lid

15:50.598 --> 15:52.339
because she found all my
nudie mags in the basement.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.709
Anyways, BRB.

15:55.703 --> 15:58.386
What happened to not wanting
to gamble anymore for Kevin?

15:58.422 --> 16:01.144
Sir, you are spiraling. You
lied straight to our faces.

16:01.180 --> 16:02.295
Well, that's on you.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.618
If you could spot my tell,
you would've known.

16:04.654 --> 16:05.859
Fine. What's your tell?

16:05.895 --> 16:07.525
Let's just say, I'm doing it right now.

16:07.561 --> 16:09.225
I'm doing it at this very moment.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.375
- Is it standing up?
- I've just done it again.

16:11.411 --> 16:13.144
Whoops, there's another time.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.269
I don't understand.
Even if you wanted to gamble,

16:15.305 --> 16:17.032
why come here, where we'd be?

16:17.068 --> 16:19.899
I lost some money on lame little Jayla,

16:19.935 --> 16:21.998
and I realized that's because
I've been gambling

16:22.034 --> 16:25.440
instead of being down here
doing what I'm good at... math.

16:25.476 --> 16:27.911
Now go get Valdano before
you blow your covers.

16:27.947 --> 16:31.352
I'm off duty; what I do on my
own time is my own business.

16:31.388 --> 16:33.710
Unlike you two who are
still on the clock

16:33.746 --> 16:35.331
and are now being bad cops.

16:35.367 --> 16:37.989
Wow, listen to you talking all smooth.

16:38.025 --> 16:39.785
But you can't fool us, sir.

16:39.821 --> 16:41.427
You might as well face it.

16:41.482 --> 16:43.869
You're addicted to math. Robert Palmer.

16:43.905 --> 16:45.391
Come on, Sarge. Let's go.

16:50.287 --> 16:52.055
So you're a cop.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.045
[softly] There was a pooper.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.776
Sorry about that.

16:58.812 --> 17:01.054
Crisis averted: I told her
I read the magazines

17:01.088 --> 17:02.926
for the articles. She totally bought it.

17:02.962 --> 17:05.525
- Wait a sec, where are you going?
- Got called away on business.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.965
Come back next Friday; I'll
take your money from you then.

17:08.002 --> 17:09.396
[laughs]

17:09.429 --> 17:12.565
Well, we'll just see about
that, Mr. Cool Voice.

17:13.506 --> 17:15.034
His voice is really cool.

17:15.069 --> 17:17.105
[crickets chirping]

17:21.694 --> 17:23.868
So I understand you're a cop

17:23.905 --> 17:25.714
who's trying to bring me down.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.547
Why don't we take a little drive?

17:28.256 --> 17:31.418
Why did you stay at the table so long
after Valdano was already gone?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.534
It would've been suspicious
if I left right after he did,

17:33.570 --> 17:34.913
so I played a couple hands.

17:34.949 --> 17:36.507
Come on, let's grab Holt
and get out of here.

17:36.679 --> 17:38.220
Wait. Where's Holt?

17:39.468 --> 17:41.635
So what was your plan, cop?

17:41.671 --> 17:44.836
Does it matter? We failed and
now you know we're onto you.

17:44.872 --> 17:46.627
You get to come out ahead tonight,

17:46.663 --> 17:48.790
provided you don't do
anything dumb right now.

17:48.826 --> 17:50.204
[phone buzzes]

17:50.240 --> 17:53.526
My colleagues are calling,
probably wondering where I am.

17:53.562 --> 17:55.295
Then put their minds at ease.

17:57.220 --> 17:58.388
- Yes?
- Captain.

17:58.424 --> 17:59.479
We're leaving. Where are you?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.798
I've already left.
I don't enjoy being judged,

18:01.834 --> 18:04.032
so I'm on my way to Atlantic
City for the weekend.

18:04.068 --> 18:05.104
I'll be gambling.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.642
No, sir, please just come back, okay?

18:07.678 --> 18:09.218
Terry and I will keep you company.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.434
We'll go to a museum.

18:10.470 --> 18:12.336
One of the boring ones
with no dinosaurs.

18:12.372 --> 18:14.207
Forget it. I shouldn't've answered.

18:14.365 --> 18:15.566
[exhales sharply]

18:19.937 --> 18:21.671
Bye-bye "Toxic."

18:21.707 --> 18:23.578
Bye-bye "Party in the USA."

18:23.614 --> 18:25.016
Hey, Charles. What are you doing?

18:25.052 --> 18:27.749
I'm deleting all the upbeat
music off my computer.

18:27.785 --> 18:28.939
I know you're down, but...

18:28.975 --> 18:30.919
Bye-bye "Swish Swish Bish."

18:30.955 --> 18:33.223
Look, I feel really bad
about the way I treated you.

18:33.259 --> 18:34.364
Well, you shouldn't.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.778
You're the only one who saw
that my dream was stupid

18:36.814 --> 18:38.330
and then you got me all my money back.

18:38.366 --> 18:41.489
Well, after you left,
I tried one of your meatballs

18:41.525 --> 18:42.693
and then another.

18:42.729 --> 18:44.686
And another. I couldn't stop

18:44.722 --> 18:46.760
because they were so damn good.

18:46.796 --> 18:48.321
Really? You liked them?

18:48.357 --> 18:51.433
I loved them. I should have
tried them earlier.

18:51.469 --> 18:53.439
I lost track of the fact
that this whole thing

18:53.475 --> 18:55.803
was supposed to be about your food.

18:55.839 --> 18:57.310
I think we should buy
another food truck.

18:57.346 --> 18:58.647
- You do?
- Yes.

18:58.835 --> 19:00.494
But I have some conditions:

19:00.530 --> 19:02.829
1, it cannot be a crime scene;

19:02.865 --> 19:05.724
2, you have to get insurance on day one;

19:05.760 --> 19:08.869
3, you have to keep dreaming up
amazing things to cook.

19:09.279 --> 19:10.991
You're so good, Boyle.

19:11.163 --> 19:13.168
Deal! We're gonna buy a food truck!

19:13.204 --> 19:15.086
We're gonna get a food truck! Yes!

19:15.122 --> 19:16.613
Stop!

19:17.662 --> 19:19.164
I ate too many meatballs.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.193
Oh.

19:21.074 --> 19:22.952
- Where we going?
- Atlantic City.

19:22.988 --> 19:24.621
That's where you told
your friends you'd be,

19:24.657 --> 19:26.096
so that's where they'll find your body.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.357
I'm a captain in the NYPD.

19:28.393 --> 19:31.121
Yeah, and you're also
a known gambling addict.

19:31.157 --> 19:33.193
You lost all your money in A.C.

19:33.229 --> 19:35.948
and then drowned yourself in the ocean.

19:35.984 --> 19:38.411
- [tires squeal]
- [horn blares]

19:38.447 --> 19:40.889
- [all grunt]
- Stay down!

19:40.925 --> 19:42.682
Terry: NYPD! Keep your
hands on the wheel.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.796
[sighs] Hey there, Captain Holt.

19:45.832 --> 19:47.471
We just saved your big ol' butt.

19:47.507 --> 19:49.796
Hello, Dan "Daniel" Valdano.

19:49.832 --> 19:52.044
- Guess what.
- Terry: You're a dick!

19:52.396 --> 19:53.618
Yeah.

19:53.654 --> 19:54.915
How did you find me?

19:54.951 --> 19:56.945
We traced your phone
and tracked down the limo.

19:56.981 --> 19:59.451
Wait. How did you even know
I was in trouble?

19:59.487 --> 20:01.287
I figured out your tell.

20:01.358 --> 20:04.200
When you're lying, you use contractions.
Lots of 'em.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.242
I've lost control.
I'm taking myself off the case.

20:06.278 --> 20:09.503
I've just done it again.
Whoops. There's another time.

20:09.539 --> 20:11.542
I shouldn't've have answered.
Shouldn't've answered.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.679
[slo-mo] Shouldn't've...

20:12.997 --> 20:15.648
It was the "shouldn't've"
that finally tipped me off.

20:15.684 --> 20:18.270
I've never heard you use
a double contraction before.

20:18.306 --> 20:20.453
And you never will again.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.277
I was at rock bottom.

20:23.980 --> 20:26.663
I feel so embarrassed.

20:26.699 --> 20:28.389
I understand. I've been there.

20:28.425 --> 20:31.035
I once ate a box of uncooked
rice in a movie theater.

20:31.079 --> 20:32.317
Wow, really?

20:32.534 --> 20:34.029
- Jake.
- I'm sorry.

20:34.065 --> 20:37.427
I owe you two a tremendous
debt of gratitude.

20:37.970 --> 20:41.541
I was overwhelmed by my addiction
and you were there for me.

20:42.559 --> 20:45.211
Of course, sir.
We'd do anything for you.

20:45.247 --> 20:48.639
Perhaps you two would take me
to a meeting of Gambler's Anonymous.

20:48.675 --> 20:51.200
- Absolutely.
- And, Jake, before we go,

20:51.908 --> 20:54.325
- I need to admit one more thing.
- Of course, anything.

20:54.361 --> 20:56.123
When I made you tell that table

20:56.159 --> 20:57.507
that you were living
in your mother's basement,

20:57.543 --> 20:58.917
it wasn't for the case.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.798
I was just messing with you.

21:00.834 --> 21:03.155
Oh, well played, sir.

21:03.191 --> 21:04.458
But the joke's on you.

21:04.494 --> 21:06.469
My mother has a fantastic basement.

21:06.505 --> 21:07.907
Title of your sex tape. Too soon?

21:07.943 --> 21:09.001
All right, let's go.

21:10.137 --> 21:11.972
Hey, standing desk.

21:12.008 --> 21:13.645
Look who's taking care of herself.

21:13.681 --> 21:16.008
- Someone's not sitting down on the job.
- Hey.

21:16.933 --> 21:18.601
Sitting down on the job
is damned hard work,

21:18.637 --> 21:20.697
and those heroes prove it every day.

21:20.733 --> 21:22.154
Mad respect.

21:23.163 --> 21:25.585
Okay. Sorry.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.229
Seriously, you guys should
stand up once in a while.

21:28.265 --> 21:29.644
You know, for your hearts.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.549
[laughter]
