00:00.900 --> 00:03.596
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:03.630 --> 00:05.723
Team Echo was on their
second mission of the night.

00:05.770 --> 00:08.193
ERIC: They breached the
structure. Seconds later,

00:08.240 --> 00:10.299
there was an explosion.
So you're telling me that

00:10.340 --> 00:12.433
all six members of
Echo Team are dead?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.436
Aresh Kamal. Bomb maker.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.607
Kamal's strictly
mercenary, that means

00:16.650 --> 00:19.448
somebody backed up the truck
big time for the Echo job,

00:19.480 --> 00:21.311
and we want to find out
who that is.

00:21.350 --> 00:23.489
BROCK: He's got something.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.784
MANDY: You guys pulled a lot
of intel out of that house.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.186
Hoping one of the cell phones
will give us a target.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.381
Something else I
want to run by you.
Okay, what's that?

00:30.430 --> 00:31.522
What if somebody

00:31.560 --> 00:33.221
blackmailed Tariq?

00:33.260 --> 00:34.454
His relationship
with Azim

00:34.500 --> 00:36.058
would'_ve made him
a prime target.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.829
He told me to forget about
the man with a red car.

00:37.870 --> 00:39.462
Man with a red car?

00:39.500 --> 00:41.229
A man Tariq did business with.

00:41.270 --> 00:42.806
I'm Paul Mulwray.
I write for Vice.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.434
Who do you know around here
drives a red Mercedes?

00:45.470 --> 00:48.769
This part of the country,
I know of exactly one.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.607
We're gonna find
the guy behind it,

00:50.650 --> 00:52.470
and then we're gonna find
the guy behind him

00:52.520 --> 00:54.545
and the guy behind him
because that's what we do.

JASON: Mandy. Mandy.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.224
I need to talk to you. Okay?

03:24.270 --> 03:25.692
So get up. We need to talk.

03:25.730 --> 03:27.539
Come on. Let's go.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.429
It's a little early
for the after action review.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.732
Well, you know what, the AAR's
gonna be a little late

03:34.780 --> 03:36.372
for what I have
to say right now.

03:36.410 --> 03:37.672
Okay? So look,
I made some-some coffee.

03:37.710 --> 03:39.348
You want some coffee?
What's up? No.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.018
No? Here, have some coffee.
It's good for you.

03:41.050 --> 03:42.745
You're gonna like it.
Okay, so?

03:42.790 --> 03:43.916
So... So.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.918
It's been, what?
It's been a week

03:45.950 --> 03:49.454
since we rolled up on this
bomb guy, Kamal. Right?

03:49.490 --> 03:51.720
One week.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.990
Based on the intel that
we took from his place

03:54.030 --> 03:56.362
and-and the contacts
that we got off his phone,

03:56.400 --> 03:57.924
we have hit 18 targets.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.562
That's 18 targets
in seven days.

03:59.600 --> 04:00.794
And what have we come up with?

04:00.840 --> 04:03.365
What?
I don't think
you need this.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.264
What?
We always knew that
there was a possibility

04:05.310 --> 04:07.631
that Kamal's associates would
dump their old phone numbers.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.841
That's right, and now we know
for sure that they did, okay?

04:09.880 --> 04:12.314
But how does that bring us
any closer to finding the guys

04:12.350 --> 04:14.818
that hired Kamal to put a hit
on our brothers from Echo Team?

04:14.850 --> 04:17.444
We find them another way.
What way?

04:17.490 --> 04:18.741
We'll find a way.
What way?

04:18.790 --> 04:20.985
There's still Salim Hakan.
Salim Hakan the cop?

04:21.020 --> 04:22.885
Well, we know he was
linked to the guy

04:22.930 --> 04:23.954
who lead Echo to their deaths.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.458
Just find me the guy
that took out Steve Porter.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.558
That's all I care about.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.488
Once you put
that package together,

04:29.530 --> 04:31.862
we will be ready to go.
Ready to go.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.368
Man, I am tired.
I'm so tired.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.460
I got to get some sleep.
Enjoy that coffee, will you?

04:37.510 --> 04:38.807
I need rest.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.968
You know,
1-1 was sleeping.

04:42.010 --> 04:43.739
Asleep.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.945
MULWRAY: You here to give me
the scoop you owe me

04:48.980 --> 04:50.845
for the tip about
the red Mercedes?

04:50.890 --> 04:52.949
What more can you tell me
about Salim Hakan?

04:52.990 --> 04:54.389
Didn't I give you my

04:54.420 --> 04:55.956
"information is
currency" speech?

04:55.990 --> 04:58.857
I promised I'd give you some
soon as I had some to give.

04:58.890 --> 05:01.620
Okay. How about why were
you interested in the car?

05:01.660 --> 05:03.662
All you have to do is say,
"Off the record,"

05:03.700 --> 05:05.019
and we're_ in the
cone of Silence.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.436
Definitely off
the record.

05:07.470 --> 05:08.789
The man in the
red Mercedes

05:08.840 --> 05:11.559
was leaning on Tariq Jamala
before he died.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.771
Says who?
The boyfriend?

05:13.810 --> 05:15.801
I heard he'd
been talking.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.740
Don't suppose I could get
a few minutes with him?

05:17.780 --> 05:20.510
I'm sure daddy can make
another phone call.

05:20.550 --> 05:22.745
Pretty sure I told you
I don't call my father "daddy."

05:22.790 --> 05:24.519
Aanay. . .

05:24.550 --> 05:26.108
Congressman Mulwray would prefer

05:26.150 --> 05:28.755
I stop reporting
on the incident altogether.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.485
We lost six Tier One operators.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.748
Kind of thing might give people
the idea we're not winning.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.756
Can't have that.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.119
You really think
that Salim Hakan

05:36.160 --> 05:37.889
forced Tariq
to set up your guys?

05:37.930 --> 05:40.899
I really thinkI need
to know more about him.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.865
Salim's business is doing favors
for powerful people.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.002
Us included.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.928
Only way he's managed
to survive.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.538
When the asteroid hits,

05:49.580 --> 05:51.445
it'll just be Salim
and the cockroaches.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.813
Hard to see killing Americans
as a recipe for survival.

05:54.850 --> 05:56.647
Any chance he got radicalized?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.840
No. But there is a chance
that he's decided

05:58.890 --> 06:00.152
the radicals are
the horse to back.

06:00.190 --> 06:01.851
You have a relationship
with him?

06:01.890 --> 06:05.849
Salim only talks
to reporters he can buy.

06:05.890 --> 06:07.528
No matter who their fathers are.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.528
He'll talk
to you, though.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.060
Salim loves beautiful women.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.534
He'll know who
you work for,

06:13.570 --> 06:14.867
and he'll still talk to you.

06:14.900 --> 06:18.529
I work for the State Department.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.651
Cerberus...

06:45.670 --> 06:46.659
Yo, J.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.105
I'm up.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.068
JASON: It's the bomb
maker's place.

06:53.110 --> 06:54.475
BROCK:
Yeah, Kamal.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.102
Yeah, right. What am
I looking at here?

06:56.140 --> 06:58.472
It's just after
this. Watch.

06:58.510 --> 07:00.910
He's going to find
something in the wall.

07:00.950 --> 07:01.746
Right there.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.543
He doesn't sit,
so no explosives.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.889
Yeah. Originally, he was
imprinted on narcotics.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.821
Right. Good boy.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.122
Thanks to intel gleaned

07:14.160 --> 07:16.151
from the video taken
of the Aresh Kamal assault

07:16.200 --> 07:17.827
by one of our team members...

07:17.870 --> 07:19.667
Good boy!

07:19.700 --> 07:20.667
Cerberus!

07:20.700 --> 07:21.837
Get that dog a bone!

07:21.870 --> 07:23.007
MANDY: ...we were
able to task

07:23.040 --> 07:25.235
an Army daylight presence patrol

07:25.270 --> 07:27.033
with re-visiting
Kamal's workshop.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.708
They checked the spot
that drew Cerberus's interest

07:29.750 --> 07:30.842
and they found these

07:30.880 --> 07:32.939
hidden within the walls.

07:32.980 --> 07:33.912
That's heroin, boys.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.577
Yeah, no kidding.
Afghan Brown.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.019
How much you think
that's worth?

07:37.050 --> 07:38.210
Ten grand,
give or take.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.115
That's it?
CLAY: That's all
it's worth here.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.687
You get back stateside, you're
looking at high six figures.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.789
Huh. Time to shine, boys.
Let's go.

07:46.830 --> 07:48.024
Pretend I didn't hear that.

07:48.060 --> 07:48.890
SONNY:
Come on, man.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.921
So, ten grand, too little
for a dealer,

07:50.970 --> 07:52.699
too much for a user.
That's his paycheck.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.799
Saying that whoever
hired Kamal

07:54.840 --> 07:56.535
to build the bomb
that killed Echo Team

07:56.570 --> 07:57.798
paid him in heroin?

07:57.840 --> 07:59.876
Looks that way.
JASON: Huh.

07:59.910 --> 08:02.037
You sure we could trace
that heroin to the source?

08:02.080 --> 08:02.899
MANDY:
It's already done.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.770
The relative crudeness
of the product

08:04.810 --> 08:05.902
makes it easier to trace.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.271
BLACKBURN: _
The opium in these bricks

08:08.320 --> 08:12.689
came from a poppy farm
20 klicks west of Jalalabad.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.859
Two months ago,
an American task force

08:14.890 --> 08:15.959
raided that same field

08:15.990 --> 08:18.788
as part of an op designed
to attack the resources

08:18.830 --> 08:20.991
of the_ Taliban
revenue in the area.

08:21.030 --> 08:22.588
Whole lot of fields were burned.

08:22.630 --> 08:24.063
Hm. It's not
a bad motive,

08:24.100 --> 08:26.568
drug dealer gets pissed all
of his product goes up in smoke.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.692
Eh, it gets better.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.537
Echo Team did the burning.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.069
JASON:
Echo burns the fields,

08:33.110 --> 08:34.304
somebody gets mad,

08:34.340 --> 08:37.275
burns them.

08:37.310 --> 08:39.710
CLAY: How can you
be sure, though?

08:39.750 --> 08:41.741
I mean, even if this comes
from the same farm,

08:41.780 --> 08:42.986
this whole thing
could be a coincidence.

08:43.020 --> 08:46.581
Because it came from
the bomb maker's house.

08:46.620 --> 08:49.054
We all know that Afghanistan
is flooded with heroin.

08:49.090 --> 08:51.149
All right? So you can't
tie this specifically

08:51.190 --> 08:53.158
to Echo Team's actions,
is all I'm saying there, cowboy.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.952
MANDY: I asked
the same question.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.524
It's a good question.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.838
This is from Kamal's
workshop eight days ago,

08:59.870 --> 09:02.532
just before the assault.
See that truck?

09:04.010 --> 09:06.808
This is from the poppy farm
several months ago.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.875
Ah, it's the same truck.

09:07.910 --> 09:10.970
The truck directly ties
the bomb maker to the farm

09:11.010 --> 09:12.272
and Echo Team.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.914
We're a go
for tonight.

09:13.950 --> 09:15.076
Right on.

09:15.120 --> 09:15.939
All right.

09:15.980 --> 09:17.015
MANDY: These farms
are usually owned

09:17.050 --> 09:20.019
by big drug lords, so you
probably won't encounter

09:20.060 --> 09:21.914
the owner within
100 miles of here.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.086
Maybe 1,000.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.722
Still, it's progress.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.657
* ...when you come on down

09:28.700 --> 09:30.827
* Won't you come on down,
I said *

09:30.870 --> 09:33.737
* To my town...

09:33.770 --> 09:36.295
Hey, honk the horn.
It's all my fault.

09:36.340 --> 09:39.264
Why don't you get out there
and see what's going on?
Yeah.

09:39.310 --> 09:40.971
Going on?
It's a fender bender.

09:41.010 --> 09:42.944
SONNY: Ooh-wee.

09:42.980 --> 09:44.971
That's someone I'd take home
to my mother, right there.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.272
In your dreams, brother.
In your dreams.

09:46.310 --> 09:47.675
SONNY:
Look at that.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.144
She's gonna talk
her way out of it.

09:51.190 --> 09:52.179
See? There he goes.

09:55.990 --> 09:58.652
Oh, I think she's
checking you out, boy.
Oh, yeah?

10:00.000 --> 10:00.796
Ooh!
Oh, man.

10:00.830 --> 10:03.025
SONNY: She just gave you
the steel eye.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.123
*

11:01.820 --> 11:04.084
Okay, go.

11:49.070 --> 11:51.368
No movement.
It's a kariz.

11:51.410 --> 11:52.934
Ancient irrigation tunnel

11:52.980 --> 11:54.277
Thanks, Captain Obvious.

11:54.310 --> 11:55.971
You do realize this is
my ninth deployment

11:56.010 --> 11:57.102
to Afghanistan?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.778
Yeah, I heard that.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.845
I'll go first.
No, easy there.
I got this.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.416
Last thing I want
to be doing is

12:03.450 --> 12:06.214
dragging your skinny butt
out of another hole.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.717
And...

12:08.560 --> 12:09.788
In there.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.229
Hey, you sell poppies

12:11.260 --> 12:12.420
for the Taliban, huh?

12:12.460 --> 12:13.927
Ask him if he sells
poppies for the Taliban.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.997
Says he doesn't know
any Taliban.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.769
Does he own the farm?

12:24.140 --> 12:26.358
No.
Okay, ask him
who owns it.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.216
He says his cousin runs it
for the owner.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.138
He rents it directly
from him.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.384
Kamal?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.316
Aresh Kamal?

12:44.360 --> 12:45.384
That name familiar
to you?

12:45.430 --> 12:47.125
You know him?
Ask him.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.137
Says he doesn't know Kamal.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.286
Holy hell.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.208
Guy's basically
a sharecropper, brother.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.887
Grows poppies 'cause it pays him
20 times more

13:15.920 --> 13:17.353
than what he'd make
growmg wheat.

13:17.390 --> 13:20.894
Come on, look,
you blame him?
I'm saying,

13:20.930 --> 13:23.194
even if he wanted to hit Echo
Team, you really see that guy

13:23.230 --> 13:25.061
putting together
an op that clean?

13:25.100 --> 13:27.068
I'll tell you, he's
covering for something.
I know.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.239
SONNY :
Boss, we got something.

13:29.270 --> 13:31.135
What do you got?

13:31.170 --> 13:33.274
You're gonna want to
see this for yourself.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.108
Right this way.

13:45.890 --> 13:48.085
Cha-ching.
Wow.

13:54.230 --> 13:56.095
It's more than ten million.
That's not including

13:56.130 --> 13:57.097
the Afghani or the euros.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.563
Looks like Farmer John

13:58.600 --> 14:00.261
made out pretty well
for himself.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.858
That's for damn sure.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.333
Yeah, the thing I want to know
is what's a farmer doing

14:03.370 --> 14:04.860
with $10 million?

14:04.910 --> 14:06.605
Well, tell you what.
Let's find out.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.403
Bravo 2, how we doing
with that farmer?

14:08.440 --> 14:10.101
I'm working on it.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.017
Come on, brother,
money's on your land.

14:13.050 --> 14:14.517
You're telling us you don't
know who it belongs to?

14:18.690 --> 14:20.351
You're already in trouble,
you want your wife and kids

14:20.390 --> 14:21.379
to be in trouble, too?

14:27.130 --> 14:28.427
All right, I'll just
have her brought down here

14:28.460 --> 14:30.098
to ask her directly.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.427
Vanessa, could you
please bring...

14:32.700 --> 14:35.032
He will tell us.
Hold.

14:35.070 --> 14:38.198
All right, talk.

14:45.350 --> 14:46.977
After the Americans
burned the field,

14:47.020 --> 14:48.476
men came and put
the money here.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.442
What men?

14:55.960 --> 14:57.086
Says he doesn't
know their names,

14:57.130 --> 14:59.223
just knows they're hard men.
Taliban?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.695
Says he doesn't know.
They put the money down there,

15:06.730 --> 15:08.288
take it out as they need it.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.264
He's a bank.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.198
How often do they come?

15:15.180 --> 15:16.135
Most days.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.000
Have they come today?

15:19.110 --> 15:20.111
No, no.

15:35.130 --> 15:37.018
Amanda Bell.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.719
When your embassy called
to arrange for this meeting,

15:53.750 --> 15:56.241
they should have
prepared me for your beauty.

15:56.280 --> 16:01.217
That's very kind,
General Hakan.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.228
I'm glad we could
speak in private.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.251
(speaks Pashto,
snaps fingers)

16:13.340 --> 16:16.195
I'm always happy to help
the American State Department.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.605
Look at all you've
done for us.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.234
General Hakan,
I think we both know

16:20.280 --> 16:22.703
that I don't actually work
for the State Department.

16:22.740 --> 16:26.540
Always happy to help
the CIA as well.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.445
I'm looking into
what happened

16:28.480 --> 16:30.710
to our team-- the one
that was killed.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.412
Terrible thing.
And you arrived with

16:33.460 --> 16:35.257
the team that
replaced them, yes?

16:35.290 --> 16:37.588
For the last week,
you've been sending them

16:37.630 --> 16:40.997
to kick doors,
with limited results.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.719
Is that funny?

16:44.770 --> 16:48.695
I was told your
sources are excellent.

16:48.740 --> 16:52.506
As a matter of fact,
that's why I'm here.

16:52.540 --> 16:55.373
I'm hoping you can
tell me something

16:55.410 --> 16:58.174
about the man who walked
our team into that house.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.042
Tariq Jamala.

17:02.080 --> 17:02.944
Did you know him well?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.414
We've crossed paths
from time to time

17:05.450 --> 17:10.058
as two of the few man
of means in this provmce.

17:10.090 --> 17:11.819
But we did not belong
to the same social circles.

17:11.860 --> 17:15.193
Do you know of any reason
he would want to kill Americans?

17:15.230 --> 17:17.698
This is the question
that has plagued me.

17:17.730 --> 17:20.198
And my only thought
is that he may have

17:20.240 --> 17:21.468
been forced into it.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.060
A man like that,

17:24.110 --> 17:27.273
compromised with
unnatural sexual desire,

17:27.310 --> 17:29.699
is always a target
for extortion.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.208
Any idea who may
have forced him?

17:32.250 --> 17:35.344
Sadly, as you may have noticed,

17:35.380 --> 17:37.143
there are many here
who are less than grateful

17:37.190 --> 17:38.145
for our liberation.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.589
Halani Network?

17:39.620 --> 17:40.814
Top of the list,
to be sure.

17:40.860 --> 17:44.352
As I say, you will find
no shortage of groups

17:44.390 --> 17:47.257
in this area who live
to kill Americans.

17:47.300 --> 17:52.465
Well... thank you
for your time.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.491
Miss Bell.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.758
What happened to your men
should have never happened.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.859
I wish you the best
of luck in finding

17:58.910 --> 18:02.175
the evildoers responsible
and bringing them to justice.

18:12.150 --> 18:14.152
JASON:
Okay, so we got what,

18:14.190 --> 18:15.384
20 million stuffed
down that hole?

18:15.420 --> 18:16.819
Any ideas what we
want to do with it?

18:16.860 --> 18:18.623
Bitcoin.
Bitcoin?

18:18.660 --> 18:20.890
Naima's been trying to explain
that to me. Sounds volatile.

18:20.930 --> 18:23.125
No growth without
risk, my friend.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.126
Hey, look, we're not
investing the stuff, guys.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.762
Well, we can go to Vegas.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.732
You know,
I got some sweethearts there

18:27.770 --> 18:29.863
that are missing me.
Stop.

18:29.900 --> 18:30.867
I say we leave
the money where it is,

18:30.910 --> 18:31.763
wait and see who
comes to get it.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.801
Back off,
surveil the place with ISR?

18:33.840 --> 18:35.307
Yeah.

18:35.340 --> 18:38.173
That's a safe choice.
What about the family?

18:38.210 --> 18:39.541
We take 'em with us.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.377
JASON: Okay, then there's
no one here at the farm.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.149
It's dark, and the bad guys
will never show up.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.385
We can also leave them.

18:45.420 --> 18:46.819
It's too dangerous.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.386
The farmer's scared,
but he's not that scared.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.910
He could warn his buddies.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.188
Well, if they are
his buddies.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.254
If they book,
we'd never see 'em.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.655
They'd be losing
their millions.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.758
Could be pocket change
to these guys. We don't know.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.825
Deep pockets.

18:56.860 --> 18:58.725
I say we leave the money,
but we stick with it.

18:58.770 --> 19:01.739
Let's go.
Okay, stay behind.

19:01.770 --> 19:03.203
RAY: This is a transfer
p0int for funds

19:03.240 --> 19:04.400
fueling a whole mess
of nasty stuff,

19:04.440 --> 19:05.737
probably including

19:05.770 --> 19:06.907
the murder of our boys.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.373
The farmer said the bad guys

19:08.410 --> 19:09.775
haven't been by today yet.

19:09.810 --> 19:10.947
That's a whole lot
of cash down there.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.447
Somebody's gonna show up for it,

19:12.480 --> 19:14.209
and when they do,
personally, I'd love

19:14.250 --> 19:15.217
to be here to say hello.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.787
All right, so we're good.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.742
We stay behind.
RAY: Oh, yeah.

19:19.790 --> 19:21.280
TOC, it's Bravo 1.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.322
Copy, Bravo 1.
How we looking?

19:23.360 --> 19:24.918
Well, farmhouse is secure,

19:24.960 --> 19:27.292
as well as one
military-age male,

19:27.330 --> 19:29.252
one female and three kids.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.188
We're thinking that it's
a farmer and family.

19:31.230 --> 19:33.460
We also came across
a large amount of cash

19:33.500 --> 19:34.762
in an irrigation tunnel.

19:36.940 --> 19:39.704
Copy, Bravo 1. How large
a cache we talking here?

19:39.740 --> 19:41.230
Estimate about a few mil.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.271
Could be tied
to the Echo Team hit.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.801
I recommend we sit on it
and see who it belongs to.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.977
It's a smart place to stash
that amount of money.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.669
Nobody's looking
in a burnt-out farm.

19:49.720 --> 19:53.884
Bravo 1, are you proposing
staying on target

19:53.920 --> 19:55.410
until the bad guys show up?

19:55.460 --> 19:56.916
That's affirmative.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.349
Any idea when
that'll likely be?

19:59.390 --> 20:01.950
Well, farmer said
they're overdue.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.594
Yeah, well, daylight's
in less than two hours.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.621
Roger that.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.264
Bravo 1, mission approved.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.870
I'll inform Colonel Martin
that Alpha and Bravo Teams

20:13.910 --> 20:15.571
will be extending
their time on target.

20:15.610 --> 20:16.929
That's good copy, TOC.

20:16.980 --> 20:19.278
Daylight's gonna catch 'em.

20:19.310 --> 20:20.345
I don't know about that.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.439
They got company,
like, right now.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.345
That was quick.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.745
Bravo 1, this is TOC.
Go for 1.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.280
Be advised you've got
a vehicle approaching

20:28.320 --> 20:30.254
from the south-- looks like

20:30.290 --> 20:31.484
a small two-wheeler,
a moped, maybe.

20:31.530 --> 20:32.485
Just one?

20:32.530 --> 20:33.929
Yes.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.758
There's no way he fits
all that stash on one moped.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.358
Maybe he's making
multiple trips.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.867
How far out?

20:39.900 --> 20:41.868
He's gonna be to you
in less than five minutes.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.436
Copy that.

20:43.470 --> 20:45.665
Looks like you're gonna
get that hello, Ray.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.316
Don't shoot.

21:38.390 --> 21:40.927
I'm a friend.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.994
What's your name?
Uh, my name is Turan.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.769
How old are you, Turan?
Fifteen.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.471
Where do you live?

21:53.510 --> 21:55.432
Here. On the next farm.
Very close.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.833
Speak pretty good English
for a local kid.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.677
I watch a lot of American TV.

21:58.710 --> 21:59.972
You said you live on a farm?

22:00.010 --> 22:01.443
Yes, sir. With my mother

22:01.480 --> 22:02.777
and younger brothers
and sisters.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.515
To feed my family,
I must work on the fields.

22:04.550 --> 22:06.108
24/7, I work.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.981
For such a busy man,
where do you find all the time

22:08.020 --> 22:09.055
to watch all that TV?

22:09.090 --> 22:10.819
I don't sleep very much.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.384
Which brings us to this moment.

22:12.430 --> 22:13.727
Yes, it is like this.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.557
I heard a rumor in town
about the money.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.364
With so much, I thought no one
would notice if I took a little.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.459
Just this small amount will feed
my family for a year.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.559
The rumor that you heard, about
the money, where'd it come from?

22:22.600 --> 22:24.409
TURAN:
Some boys in town.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.032
JASON: They say who
the money belonged to?

22:26.070 --> 22:27.435
TURAN:
No.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.402
What do you think?

22:29.440 --> 22:30.748
If you saw those boys
on the street,

22:30.780 --> 22:31.906
would you be able
to point them out?

22:31.950 --> 22:33.008
Sure.

22:33.050 --> 22:34.608
JASON:
Do you know their names?

22:34.650 --> 22:37.380
I say we put a tracker
on the moped.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.388
Let him go, see where he lands.

22:39.420 --> 22:40.910
Except, we let him out of
our sight, he tells somebody,

22:40.960 --> 22:42.552
and nobody comes,
picks up the money.

22:42.590 --> 22:43.852
And we're at a dead end, again.

22:43.890 --> 22:44.982
Yeah, well, that's the risk.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.018
It's not one
I'm willing to take.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.388
JASON:
Kid speaks really good English.

22:51.430 --> 22:52.692
I just don't believe
a word he says.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.459
He does have a flair
for the dramatic.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.639
That boy does manual labor
every day,

22:56.670 --> 22:57.830
his hands sure don't show it.

22:57.870 --> 22:58.837
So what are we thinking?

22:58.870 --> 22:59.837
Put him on a leash.

22:59.870 --> 23:01.098
See who else shows up.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.074
Yeah?
Sounds good to me.

23:03.110 --> 23:05.442
Farmer did say he's
overdue for a visit

23:05.480 --> 23:06.469
from the cash fairies.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.409
What are you thinking?

23:16.590 --> 23:18.888
I think we put a tracker on him,
cut him loose.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.152
Yeah?
Yeah, keep ISR on him.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.098
See where else he goes.

23:23.130 --> 23:24.620
I think the risk could
be worth the reward.

23:24.670 --> 23:25.864
Okay, I buy that.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.390
Go put a tracker on the moped.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.662
Do it. Excellent call.
All right.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.759
He gets a
case of beer.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.129
Hey, TOC, this is Bravo 1.

23:34.140 --> 23:35.835
Go for TOC.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.541
Guy on the moped's
a military-aged male.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.002
He was detained
without incident.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.541
Requesting permission to release
him to see where he goes.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.218
Copy that, Bravo 1,

23:43.250 --> 23:45.480
Sounds like you're suggesting
a follow on the ground.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.885
What's your means of transport?

23:48.120 --> 23:49.985
There's a car out back.

23:50.020 --> 23:51.453
We're gonna borrow a car.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.497
Copy that.

23:55.530 --> 23:56.622
You're good to go.

24:03.570 --> 24:04.969
The signal is live.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.602
Copy that.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.239
You're free to go.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.872
You're taking me to jail?

24:16.920 --> 24:18.046
Would never do that
to your mother.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.615
As long as you understand
that none of this ever happened.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.151
You got it?
You never saw us here._
Yes. Yes, Sir. Very good, Sir.

24:23.190 --> 24:24.828
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
Scat. Go. Get out of here.

24:49.220 --> 24:52.519
He's headed East,
toward J-Bad city.

24:52.550 --> 24:53.915
JASON:
So much for the farm.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.186
All right, in 400 meters,

24:59.230 --> 25:00.697
you're gonna be crossing
the bypass road.

25:00.730 --> 25:01.822
Copy that.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.699
All right, he turned right,
100 meters.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.840
We got daylight in 40 Mikes.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.610
My granddaddy's wheelchair
is faster than this thing.

25:23.650 --> 25:25.049
Like he's got nowhere to be.

25:25.090 --> 25:28.253
Let's hope he has
somewhere important to be.

25:29.690 --> 25:30.918
He just turned right.

25:30.960 --> 25:31.858
100 meters.

25:43.370 --> 25:45.565
The target parked his moped
in an alley.

25:45.610 --> 25:49.137
Proceed 200 meters
and take a right.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.238
Heads on a swivel, boys.

25:53.850 --> 25:57.115
He entered the building
on the north side of the alley.

25:57.150 --> 25:59.186
Lost visual contact.

26:03.390 --> 26:05.722
TOC, what are we seeing?

26:05.760 --> 26:06.852
There's no movement,
far as I can tell.

26:06.890 --> 26:08.892
Let's do this.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.338
Yo, we better hurry up, man.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.304
Call to prayer is coming soon.
SONNY: Kick it or crack it?

26:22.340 --> 26:24.046
Keep it quiet.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.350
Whoa.
Yeah, looks like we jumped
the gun on that whole

26:39.390 --> 26:40.698
"military-aged male" thing.

26:40.730 --> 26:41.719
This is not one of the secrets

26:41.760 --> 26:43.250
I thought you'd be keeping.

26:51.940 --> 26:55.103
We found these in your house.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.402
We know you work
as a messenger.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.998
Who do you work for?

26:59.710 --> 27:01.314
I know you speak English.

27:01.350 --> 27:02.749
Talk to me.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.145
Where is Shahpur?

27:04.190 --> 27:05.418
Your brother?

27:05.450 --> 27:06.747
He's here.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.314
At the base.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.782
We're taking care
of him.

27:09.820 --> 27:10.889
What is the time, please?

27:10.930 --> 27:12.386
Why?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.128
I don't think
you fully understand

27:18.170 --> 27:21.765
your situation in here, Turan.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.200
What's your real name,
by the way?

27:24.240 --> 27:26.663
I'm called Dorri.

27:26.710 --> 27:28.234
Okay, Dorri.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.908
We have evidence that ties you
to terrorist activities.

27:30.950 --> 27:34.442
Specifically, money paid
to kill American soldiers.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.313
You're obviously...

27:37.350 --> 27:40.114
a smart young woman.

27:40.150 --> 27:43.449
Resourceful, and brave.

27:43.490 --> 27:47.051
If you do
the smart thing now,

27:47.090 --> 27:49.024
if you talk to me,

27:49.060 --> 27:51.858
I can help you, and Shahpur.

27:53.900 --> 27:58.166
Believe me,
it's your best option.

27:58.210 --> 28:02.203
These envelopes are all
from a man named Isaad.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.743
He's a paymaster,
a middleman.

28:04.780 --> 28:06.042
Yeah?

28:06.080 --> 28:09.072
We know he runs couriers
for the Taliban.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.486
He's_ been in here_
for questioning a few times.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.250
In October, and then
again in July.

28:14.290 --> 28:16.781
We could never hold him, 'cause
we didn't have enough evidence,

28:16.820 --> 28:19.084
but now we do,
thanks to you.

28:19.130 --> 28:22.099
How do you think he's gonna feel
about that when he finds out?

28:22.130 --> 28:25.190
You know
what his friends do, right?

28:26.770 --> 28:27.930
They kill people.

28:27.970 --> 28:29.858
That is war.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.960
There has always been a war
here, with or without Isaad.

28:33.010 --> 28:34.329
That's true.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.905
We were orphaned four years ago,

28:38.950 --> 28:41.874
me and my brother.

28:41.920 --> 28:46.311
I only work for Isaad
so I can take care of him.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.318
I dress like a boy
so I can be in the world

28:48.360 --> 28:49.816
the way a girl cannot.

28:49.860 --> 28:51.828
And where do you take
the envelopes?

28:51.860 --> 28:53.259
Different people.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.997
Is this one of the men
that you brought envelopes to?

28:59.500 --> 29:00.831
He was.

29:00.870 --> 29:01.859
He is dead, now.

29:01.900 --> 29:02.832
This man

29:02.870 --> 29:05.930
built a bomb that killed
six of our friends.

29:05.970 --> 29:07.972
We need to find
his assooates.

29:08.010 --> 29:09.875
I-I don't know what they do.

29:09.910 --> 29:12.879
I only think about
getting to tomorrow.

29:12.910 --> 29:14.844
Every week, I take
a little extra from the kariz,

29:14.880 --> 29:16.211
and I hide it.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.945
Pretty rislq, don't you think?

29:17.990 --> 29:21.380
There is no life
in Afghanistan for a woman.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.957
I want to take my brother
to America.

29:23.990 --> 29:25.981
What would you do
once you're there?

29:26.030 --> 29:27.486
I would go
to school,

29:27.530 --> 29:31.193
and get a job that is not
working for killers.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.999
What's wrong?

29:39.040 --> 29:42.203
I am to meet Isaad today
with the money.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.379
What time?

29:44.410 --> 29:47.072
Soon.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.383
So our guys are gonna be
outside the whole time.

29:51.420 --> 29:52.944
Once you get out of there,
start heading towards

29:52.990 --> 29:54.355
the spice market.

29:54.390 --> 29:55.880
Somebody's gonna be there
to pick you up,

29:55.920 --> 29:57.080
bring you back here, okay?

29:57.120 --> 29:58.348
Okay.

29:58.390 --> 29:59.823
And be sure
not to mess with that.

29:59.860 --> 30:00.929
It's gonna draw attention to it.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.192
Hope this works.
Yeah, trust me.

30:04.230 --> 30:05.822
The kid can take care
of herself.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.394
Question is, can you trust her?

30:07.430 --> 30:10.263
MANDY: She's not political,
she's just trying to survive.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.905
And I've got something
she wants more than anything.

30:12.940 --> 30:14.931
A ticket out of here.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.403
That's promising a lot.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.305
Yeah, I know.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.170
This envelope contains the same

30:21.220 --> 30:23.609
amount of money you're supposed
to give Isaad, from the kariz.

30:23.650 --> 30:26.414
Let's go over this
one more time.

30:58.490 --> 31:01.288
Now get in there
and get that information.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.898
Salaam alaikum.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.363
KHALID:
Isaad's telling her she's late.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.164
Wants to know where she's been.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.438
She is sorry.

31:20.470 --> 31:22.006
Here's the money.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.144
Please forgive her.

31:24.180 --> 31:26.045
He wants to know
where she has been.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.014
She says her motorbike died.

31:28.050 --> 31:29.074
She had to walk.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.245
KHALID: He's telling her
if she's lying, he'll kill her.

31:36.090 --> 31:37.409
KHALID: She's telling him
the Americans

31:37.460 --> 31:38.586
picked her up
outside the city.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.190
She's sorry she lied.

31:44.230 --> 31:45.527
She was afraid.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.595
He asks,
"Where did they stop you?

31:47.630 --> 31:48.995
At the farm?"

31:51.340 --> 31:53.979
No, she says.

31:54.010 --> 31:55.637
They stopped me on the road
before I reached the farm.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.206
I told them a story.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.274
They let me go.

31:59.310 --> 32:02.040
But when she did see the farmer

32:02.080 --> 32:04.116
he told her he has been hearing
more drones overhead.

32:04.150 --> 32:06.448
He believes the American
Will come soon

32:06.490 --> 32:07.980
and discover the money.

32:08.020 --> 32:10.284
He wants to know why
the farmer believes this.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.083
She says the Americans
have been raiding

32:12.130 --> 32:13.483
the neighboring farms,

32:13.530 --> 32:15.020
but only in the night

32:15.060 --> 32:16.527
because they are too cowardly

32:16.560 --> 32:18.027
to show their faces
in the daylight.

32:19.370 --> 32:21.691
He's asking her
what she's doing.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.935
Telling her
to stay right there.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.273
"Yes, it's me, brother.

32:30.310 --> 32:32.198
"You need to come_
for your payment immediately,

32:32.250 --> 32:34.138
before the American find it."

32:36.250 --> 32:37.979
"Yes, of course.
I will join you."

32:40.390 --> 32:44.349
"Once we separate your share,
you will help me move the rest."

32:44.390 --> 32:46.187
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

32:46.230 --> 32:48.255
Isaad's meeting some clients
at the farm.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.120
Sounds like these
might be our guys.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.128
We're on our way
back to the farm.

33:12.190 --> 33:13.487
Let's go.

33:25.230 --> 33:26.128
Be advised,
you have two vehicles

33:26.170 --> 33:27.159
approaching from the south.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.031
800 meters, closing at speed.

33:29.070 --> 33:31.038
JASON:
Copy that, TOC.

33:31.070 --> 33:32.298
Alpha 1, let me know
when you got visual.

33:32.340 --> 33:33.364
FULL METAL:
Rogen

33:38.380 --> 33:40.701
It'd be a lot easier if our guys
would've stayed outside.

33:40.750 --> 33:43.173
Wait for the bad guys,
drop into the tunnel.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.084
Toss a few grenades
in after 'em.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.439
MANDY:
Well, whoever
this cash belongs to

33:45.490 --> 33:48.050
bankrolled the hit on Echo Team.

33:48.090 --> 33:50.217
We kill all these guys,
won't have anybody

33:50.260 --> 33:51.727
to tell us who that is.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.580
FULL METAL:
Bravo 1, we have visual

33:53.630 --> 33:55.552
on two enemy vehicles.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.591
Estimate eight to ten men.

33:57.630 --> 33:59.188
Copy that. Here we go, boys.

33:59.230 --> 34:01.095
Remember, we want Isaad alive.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.498
FULL METAL:
Positive visual on Isaad.

34:32.530 --> 34:33.667
JASON:
Copy that.

35:33.230 --> 35:34.754
They're taking Isaad.

35:54.950 --> 35:56.372
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.217
Target secure. Ready for exfil.

35:58.250 --> 35:59.808
What about Isaad?

36:02.460 --> 36:03.654
He didn't make it.

36:03.690 --> 36:06.284
Sorry.

36:08.960 --> 36:12.168
*

36:20.470 --> 36:21.971
Are we all good?

36:22.010 --> 36:24.649
What, that thing
about tracking the girl?

36:24.680 --> 36:26.944
Yeah.

36:26.980 --> 36:30.245
Look, what'd he ask you?

36:30.280 --> 36:31.611
Jace?
Yeah.

36:31.650 --> 36:32.617
What'd he ask
you on target?

36:32.650 --> 36:34.311
He asked me
what I thought.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.351
And you told him?
Yeah.

36:36.390 --> 36:38.688
Number one thing a team
leader asks of his men:

36:38.730 --> 36:40.755
always tell him the truth.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.599
You did that.

36:42.630 --> 36:46.259
Why would I have a problem?

36:46.300 --> 36:49.394
Now...

36:49.440 --> 36:53.536
if you'd done it
to get in my business...

36:53.570 --> 36:56.232
stick your nose
up my friend's butt,

36:56.280 --> 36:58.771
push me from what you feel
is my lofty position,

36:58.810 --> 37:03.577
if this was personal, then I
would have a problem with that.

37:03.620 --> 37:06.544
But you didn't and you
weren't and it wasn't.

37:06.590 --> 37:08.751
Right?

37:08.790 --> 37:10.280
Right.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.287
So we don't.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.388
Have a problem.

37:12.430 --> 37:13.783
Right.

37:13.830 --> 37:16.424
Now, it's still my set.

37:16.460 --> 37:17.950
All right.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.422
Get it done.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.461
Yup.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.799
WOMAN: Next time.
Next time.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.808
I promise.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.442
Is this the breakfast club?

37:32.480 --> 37:33.469
Oh, yeah.

37:33.510 --> 37:36.877
Very exclusive,
as you can see.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.785
What do I have
to do to join?

37:38.820 --> 37:40.310
Oh, apparently,
you're already a member.

37:40.350 --> 37:42.284
Perfect. Amy.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.787
Nice to meet you, Amy.
Mm-hmm.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.549
So what do you do around here
to earn your bacon

37:45.590 --> 37:47.455
besides play traffic cop?

37:47.490 --> 37:50.857
I, uh, I save
the world from bad guys.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.322
I have a good time doing it.

37:52.370 --> 37:53.621
Hmm.
How about you?

37:53.670 --> 37:54.830
Gardening, mostly.

37:54.870 --> 37:56.394
Gardening?
Yeah.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.338
Tomatoes.
Tomatoes?

37:57.370 --> 37:58.268
Yeah.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.902
Would it hurt your
feelings if I told you

37:59.940 --> 38:01.430
I do not like tomatoes?

38:01.480 --> 38:02.879
They have a very thin skin.

38:02.910 --> 38:04.377
Well, you haven't
seen mine yet.

38:04.410 --> 38:07.447
So, let me guess.
You're not Army.

38:07.480 --> 38:10.677
No.
No, you're picking your teeth
there with those Air Force boys.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.915
So I'm thinking maybe
you are something special.

38:12.950 --> 38:14.656
Like you.
Just a gardener.

38:14.690 --> 38:16.658
That's right.
Just a gardener.

38:16.690 --> 38:18.658
Well, I used to be DEA, now
I do a little contracting.

38:18.690 --> 38:19.827
Keeps me out of trouble.

38:19.860 --> 38:22.021
Doubt that.

38:22.060 --> 38:23.550
So, who do
you work with?

38:23.600 --> 38:25.989
Let's see. Black Rock?
No, Rex.

38:27.970 --> 38:30.939
No. Xeon Tactical
Security.

38:30.970 --> 38:33.438
Xeon Tactical Security.

38:33.470 --> 38:34.869
Wow, you know what?
You are special.

38:34.910 --> 38:37.606
Makes two of us,
Jason Hayes.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.412
Okay, things got
a little creepy there.
No.

38:42.450 --> 38:43.712
It's not creepy.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.388
Steve Porter

38:45.420 --> 38:46.910
told me about you.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.417
Told me you'd come through
to take his place

38:48.460 --> 38:49.813
when he rotated back home.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.452
You knew Stevie.

38:51.490 --> 38:52.923
I knew all those
Echo Team guys.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.394
There's a rumor going
around that last night

38:55.430 --> 38:56.829
you and your boys
made contact

38:56.860 --> 38:58.464
with the bastards
that killed them.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.967
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.490
I'm sure you understand.
So, it's true, though?

39:01.540 --> 39:02.689
Echo Team,
they got targeted

39:02.740 --> 39:04.662
'cause they burned
that field?

39:04.710 --> 39:05.699
Again, not at liberty
to discuss.

39:05.740 --> 39:07.037
Right. I'm just saying,

39:07.070 --> 39:08.628
I'm happy that someone's
getting payback

39:08.680 --> 39:10.636
because it could have easily
been my guys out there

39:10.680 --> 39:11.840
burning that field.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.619
Hey, I've been
looking for you.

39:17.650 --> 39:18.947
Yeah, I heard.
I was just, uh...

39:18.990 --> 39:20.878
I ran the death photos
of the bad guys

39:20.920 --> 39:22.478
from last night.

39:22.520 --> 39:23.714
I got a positive ID
on seven of 'em.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.727
Let me guess. Taliban.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.886
Al-Qaeda.

39:25.930 --> 39:27.557
Oh, wait a second.
Al

39:27.590 --> 39:28.955
That doesn't make any sense.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.127
I mean, what... why is Al-Qaeda
targeting Echo Team?

39:31.160 --> 39:32.525
Steve never said anything
about that.

39:32.570 --> 39:35.038
I mean, it was never mentioned
in a single AAR.

39:35.070 --> 39:37.391
Maybe the Qaeda guys
just needed the cash,

39:37.440 --> 39:40.534
hired themselves out
as contract killers?

39:40.570 --> 39:41.571
Well, getting paid
to kill Americans--

39:41.610 --> 39:43.407
that's a jihadi's dream
come true.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.670
Still brings us back to the
problem of who was paying them?

39:45.710 --> 39:47.041
Who owns that field?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.718
Yeah, who was paying 'em?

39:48.750 --> 39:52.186
Well, whoever it is, he's got
millions down that well.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.859
Only owes the Al-Qaeda guys
a few hundred thousand

39:54.890 --> 39:56.517
for the Echo Team hit.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.425
So, why is he trusting them
with his money?

39:58.460 --> 40:00.678
How does he know they're
not just gonna take it all?

40:02.600 --> 40:05.763
Who scares a bunch
of hard

40:05.800 --> 40:09.566
That's who we're
looking for.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.478
How are they
treating you here?

40:25.520 --> 40:26.714
Everything's cool.

40:26.750 --> 40:27.887
JASON:
That's good.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.114
I want you
to understand something.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.082
What you did for us
was very brave.

40:33.130 --> 40:35.553
What happens now?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.454
Am I going to jail?

40:37.500 --> 40:40.765
No. The information you gave us
was very valuable.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.769
It'll help us in getting
our friends some justice.

40:43.800 --> 40:47.509
We're grateful to you.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.030
Here.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.972
Should help you and
your brother for a while.

40:53.010 --> 40:55.547
Maybe get you a new laptop.

40:58.550 --> 41:00.848
I can help you more.

41:02.690 --> 41:04.487
I know other men.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.986
Lots of them.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.952
I'll give them all to you.

41:07.990 --> 41:09.594
You sure?

41:09.630 --> 41:10.551
Because you do realize
what happens to you

41:10.600 --> 41:11.669
if these men catch you.

41:11.700 --> 41:12.894
DORRI:
I know what they do.

41:12.930 --> 41:14.488
I can fool them.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.565
I fooled you.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.831
Mm. She could live on the base.

41:19.870 --> 41:21.508
Come and go as a woman.

41:21.540 --> 41:25.169
Live as a girl, work as a boy.

41:25.210 --> 41:27.974
I don't want money.

41:28.010 --> 41:30.171
I want a ticket to America.

41:30.220 --> 41:33.542
Two tickets to the USA,
thats”.

41:33.590 --> 41:36.184
that's gonna be tough,
I mean, even for us.

41:36.220 --> 41:38.085
But I think we can swing it.

41:39.690 --> 41:41.089
Thank you.

41:42.930 --> 41:44.727
What about Shahpur?

41:44.770 --> 41:46.692
What about Shahpur?

41:56.310 --> 41:58.744
You can't promise her
we can get her to the States.

41:58.780 --> 42:02.147
As long as she tells me who's
behind the Echo Team hit,

42:02.180 --> 42:04.910
I can promise her
anything I want.
