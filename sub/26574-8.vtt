[Henry] <i>Previously on,</i>
Light As A Feather.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.590
You want to know about Violet?

00:07.633 --> 00:08.675
They're all dead.

00:08.675 --> 00:09.843
You're already dead, too.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.722
[Isaac] What the hell?
You're spying on them?

00:13.722 --> 00:16.099
Mack, I'm the one
that gave the pills to Jennie.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.185
[McKenna] I've been
calling you a murderer.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.186
I should have believed you.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.398
‐We have to go there tonight.
‐Go where?

00:23.398 --> 00:26.860
To Violet's. I told them
about the journal I found
when I slept over,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.946
<i>and they think we could find</i>
<i>something useful in it.</i>

00:28.946 --> 00:31.406
What the hell is that?

00:31.406 --> 00:34.326
Look, that's not
what you think it is.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.828
[McKenna] <i>Candace is</i>
<i>in trouble. They're making</i>
<i>her do water therapy.</i>

00:36.828 --> 00:38.247
Aah!

‐[door opens]
‐[Deb] You okay?

01:40.809 --> 01:42.352
I could hear you from my room.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.105
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.398
Oh!

01:48.442 --> 01:49.776
This can't be real.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.819
[crying]

01:50.819 --> 01:52.696
Candace can't be‐‐

01:52.696 --> 01:55.615
I can't even imagine what you're
going through right now.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.660
It happened really fast,

01:58.660 --> 02:03.832
and she was already
trapped under the cover
by the time I got there.

02:03.832 --> 02:07.836
And Alex and I did
everything we could, but‐‐

02:07.836 --> 02:09.921
we were too late.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.590
[Deb] I'm so sorry.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.761

[Henry] Wild guess‐‐
you didn't get much sleep.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.957
[Trey]
Try none. You?

02:45.957 --> 02:47.292
No.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.508
I just... kept thinking
about Candace.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.719
Yeah, me, too.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.389
We have to get through this.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.140
Alex and McKenna
are in trouble,

03:02.140 --> 03:03.975
and I'm not gonna let anything
happen to her.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.728
To them.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.066
I'm sorry
about me and McKenna.

03:11.066 --> 03:15.112
You sorry it happened
or sorry I found out?

03:18.532 --> 03:22.577
Look, maybe I'll kick your ass
when this is all over and done,

03:22.577 --> 03:24.955
but for now...

03:31.086 --> 03:34.089
You know, you're
not quite the douche‐bro

03:34.089 --> 03:35.382
I thought you were, Richmond.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.259
Really?

03:37.259 --> 03:39.761
'Cause you're exactly
the asshole I thought you were.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.268
Hey, I think this book's
been around for a while,

03:46.268 --> 03:48.228
'cause all the handwriting
keeps changing.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.150
Look at this page.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.747
[cell phone buzzing]

04:07.747 --> 04:10.834
[sighs]

04:18.341 --> 04:20.510
Dad, it's kind of early.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.429
[Ed]
<i>I heard about Candace.</i>

04:22.429 --> 04:23.764
<i>Are you doing okay?</i>

04:23.764 --> 04:26.975
[sighs]
What do you think?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.685
<i>Sorry, honey, you're right.</i>

04:28.685 --> 04:30.729
<i>That was a stupid thing to‐‐</i>

04:30.729 --> 04:33.315
<i>I was just hoping</i>
<i>we could talk.</i>

04:33.315 --> 04:35.776
Well, can it be a little later?

04:35.776 --> 04:39.070
<i>Well, we could, but now would</i>
<i>probably be better.</i>

04:39.070 --> 04:42.365
Right. Why, 'cause
you have patients all day?

04:42.365 --> 04:44.868
<i>No, because I'm standing</i>
<i>outside your house.</i>

04:55.754 --> 04:58.590
Wow, to come
all the way from Florida.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.467
You really must be worried.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.260
Actually, I was
at a conference in Phoenix

05:02.260 --> 05:05.472
when your mom called,
and she told me what happened.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.140
Wow, Phoenix.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.604
Hope you didn't blow
too many frequent flier
miles on that one.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.815
Fine, you're mad,

05:14.815 --> 05:17.067
and I can't fault you for that.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.944
But I'm here
for a reason, honey.

05:18.944 --> 05:21.196
I've some parental stuff
I need to do for your sake.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.406
What kind of stuff?

05:23.406 --> 05:25.283
Well, after
your friend's memorial,

05:25.283 --> 05:27.035
what would you think of coming
out to stay with me for a while?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.453
With you?

05:28.453 --> 05:31.164
Well... with us.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.459
Oh, you mean your new family,

05:34.459 --> 05:36.461
2,000 miles away

05:36.461 --> 05:39.172
in the middle
of my senior year?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.800
Yeah, Dad,
that's not happening.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.178
You can't expect me
to leave my friends or Mom.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.513
Yeah, well, your mother's
part of the problem.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.267
She's here.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.060
She stayed.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.230
She works constantly
so I don't have to.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.108
And most importantly,
she didn't marry
one of her patients

05:58.108 --> 06:00.151
a year after my sister died.

06:00.151 --> 06:04.281
You don't get to make
command decisions, Dad.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.407
You lost that right
when you left.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.328
I love you, McKenna.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.747
But we're not done talking
about this.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.791
Yeah, we are.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.426
[door opens and closes]

06:26.720 --> 06:28.972
[Deb]
So how was that,

06:28.972 --> 06:31.057
defending me to your dad
for the same things

06:31.057 --> 06:32.809
that you've been mad
at me about?

06:32.809 --> 06:37.022
Yeah. Maybe it helped me
see your side for once.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.567
No matter what happens,

06:40.567 --> 06:43.403
I'm never gonna advocate for you
to sever ties with your dad.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.654
That said,

06:45.697 --> 06:47.198
thank you.

06:47.198 --> 06:50.243
We're gonna get through this,
I promise.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.706
I'll walk you out.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.333
[Deb] Okay.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.252
I'm gonna check on you
in a few hours.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.004
I left some money
on the kitchen counter

07:01.004 --> 07:02.714
if you and Alex want
to order something for lunch.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.634
‐Okay.
‐But just do me a favor, okay?

07:05.634 --> 07:07.761
Stay in all day.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.137
Don't go anywhere.
I need to know you're safe.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.014
Yeah. I love you.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.390
I love you, too.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.151
[knock on door]

07:28.782 --> 07:30.617
Morning, Grandma.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.243
Morning, dear.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.579
I just saw the terrible news
in the paper.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.331
Did you know that poor girl?

07:36.331 --> 07:38.500
Not as well
as I would have liked.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.877
Mm. You want
to talk about it?

07:42.379 --> 07:46.466
No, not now,
but maybe later?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.259
‐Okay.
‐[soft groan]

07:49.594 --> 07:52.138
I think I'm just
gonna get in the shower.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.682
All right, dear.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.377
‐[heavy thud]
‐Nana?!

08:23.712 --> 08:25.046
Nana?

08:26.673 --> 08:27.799
Nana?

08:33.012 --> 08:34.013
<i>Nana?</i>

08:36.057 --> 08:39.561
[woman on P. A.] <i>Dr. Shelby</i>
<i>to OR. Dr. Shelby to OR.</i>

08:44.691 --> 08:46.151
It's okay, Nana.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.155
It's gonna be okay.
I'm fixing it.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.490
I promise.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.701
[tap on door]

08:57.287 --> 08:58.747
Hi.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.331
It is a good thing you called.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.833
Your grandmother's stable.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.543
We'll have the test results
back soon.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.336
Thank you, Mrs. Brady.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.796
Of course.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.049
Hey, how's McKenna
holding up?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.842
Last night was awful.

09:10.842 --> 09:14.637
I can't even begin to imagine
how she must feel.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.306
It's sweet of you to ask.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.683
She's at home.
Alex is with her.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.185
You should stop by.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.770
I'm sure they'd love
to see you.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.607
Excuse me.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.858
Sure.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.823
[blender whirring]

09:33.823 --> 09:37.660
[cell phone ringing]

09:40.789 --> 09:43.416
There is no way McKenna will
ever play that game again.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.543
<i>‐Not after‐‐</i>
‐I don't care about that.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.045
Get me my journal back.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.924
Don't play dumb.
I know one of you has it.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.093
<i>Bring it back to me, and I'll</i>
<i>release you from the game.</i>

09:53.093 --> 09:54.969
[Alex]
<i>Candace is dead.</i>

09:54.969 --> 09:56.888
You can't pretend nothing is
happening now. I can't help you!

09:58.098 --> 09:59.849
I'm hanging up.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.434
No, you're not!

10:01.434 --> 10:03.186
<i>Now, I know</i>
<i>you're at McKenna's.</i>

10:03.186 --> 10:05.355
<i>Go into her bedroom</i>
<i>and open up her laptop.</i>

10:05.355 --> 10:06.856
What? Why?

10:06.856 --> 10:08.817
Do you want to get
out of this game or not?

10:08.817 --> 10:10.401
<i>Open it.</i>

10:10.401 --> 10:11.903
And why the hell
would I believe a word you say?

10:11.903 --> 10:13.863
Because you don't
have a choice.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.949
Open the laptop,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.742
<i>and I'll let you live.</i>

10:26.292 --> 10:28.086
I've been going
through that thing all night

10:28.086 --> 10:29.587
trying to figure it out.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.964
It's like
a Light as a Feather logbook.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.882
It's full
of death predictions.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.509
There's at least
a dozen different types
of handwriting in there.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.344
People have been
passing it down.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.180
Yeah, and there's other things
like notes and drawings

10:39.180 --> 10:42.934
and little poems
scrawled in the margins
about being cursed.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.061
Check out this torn page,
right here.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.604
[Alex]
That's Violet's handwriting.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.356
I recognize it
from our shop class notes.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.316
So‐‐ wait, this is
where she takes over.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.360
She tore out her own prediction.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.654
So, what? Is it some cult?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.573
Is there some demon
making her do it?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.366
What, like Slenderman?

10:58.366 --> 10:59.742
Or like the Manson family.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.120
Maybe there's someone

11:02.120 --> 11:03.746
who we can talk to about this.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.165
Yeah, and they can tell us
how to win the game.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.292
No, we can't. There's no one.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.961
Do you remember the scrapbook
that Lena gave us?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.006
They're dead.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.091
Everyone who's played
the game is dead.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.926
What if someone survived?

11:16.926 --> 11:20.013
Yeah. We should connect
the obituaries in the scrapbook

11:20.013 --> 11:21.723
to the death predictions
in the journal.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.433
Make sure everyone died

11:23.433 --> 11:25.518
to see if somebody else
knows what's going on.

11:25.518 --> 11:29.856
Fine, but we can't
do this here, guys.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.816
My mom will freak
if she walks in my room

11:31.816 --> 11:34.569
and sees it decorated
with dead kids.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.239
Let's go to my parents' cabin.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.366
Oh, my God, she's gonna
ground me for life,

11:40.366 --> 11:42.327
but, yeah.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.204
It's a good idea, Alex.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.146
[conversing indistinctly]

12:14.192 --> 12:15.735
So...

12:15.735 --> 12:18.154
what's going on
with you and those two?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.282
I think we have

12:21.282 --> 12:23.743
more important things
to stress about.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.203
Yeah.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.957
But I feel like the universe
has been telling me lately

12:28.957 --> 12:31.000
to get things off your chest

12:32.377 --> 12:33.795
before it's too late.

12:40.510 --> 12:44.555
Henry is awesome.

12:46.057 --> 12:49.811
And yet,
I see how you look at Trey.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.814
Is it that noticeable?

12:54.691 --> 12:56.859
See, this is
what I'm talking about.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.862
Do you know how many things
Candace kept to herself?

12:59.862 --> 13:02.949
How it took Olivia dying for her
to even say them out loud,

13:02.949 --> 13:04.575
but even then it was too late?

13:05.576 --> 13:07.078
Yeah.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.289
If this doesn't end
how we want it to‐‐

13:09.289 --> 13:11.499
‐Alex, don't.
‐Yeah, I know, but...

13:13.751 --> 13:15.920
I think you should say
something...

13:17.338 --> 13:18.506
to both of them.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.680
[Alex, whispers]
Come on.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.691
[McKenna] I guess I shouldn't be
surprised no one survived.

13:36.691 --> 13:40.695
No, we're‐‐
We're gonna beat this.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.779
[McKenna] Yeah.

13:43.406 --> 13:47.410
‐But if we don't‐‐
‐We're close, okay?

13:47.410 --> 13:49.620
There's a way out of this.
I know that.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.831
‐You just‐‐
You have to trust me.
‐I know, but, Henry,

13:51.831 --> 13:56.294
I need you to listen to me
just for one second, please?

14:00.339 --> 14:02.550
I know that
this is really stupid timing,

14:04.844 --> 14:08.014
but I really need
to tell you this,

14:08.014 --> 14:10.224
because if I‐‐
if I don't tell you now, I...

14:10.224 --> 14:11.726
I might not get the chance to.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.561
[sighs]

14:15.146 --> 14:19.567
I thought you were amazing
since I was a kid.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.530
And if I knew
we'd be this close‐‐

14:24.530 --> 14:27.950
‐McKenna.
‐I love being around you.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.914
And I feel
like us being together

14:32.914 --> 14:36.542
has somehow kept
Olivia alive, but‐‐

14:36.542 --> 14:38.211
You don't feel it.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.464
No.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.300
Not exactly.

14:46.052 --> 14:49.972
‐It's just‐‐
‐Look, it's okay, McKenna.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.226
If anything, I saw it coming.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.020
Really? Because I didn't.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.816
[Henry] It's fine.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.609
I'm not gonna lie
and say it doesn't hurt,

15:03.945 --> 15:07.782
but just know
I'm there for you.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.492
Okay?

15:10.993 --> 15:12.120
I couldn't do that
for Livvy,

15:12.120 --> 15:13.746
but I can do it for you.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.839
[faint footsteps]

15:24.841 --> 15:26.676
[whispering]
Did you hear that?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.999
[Alex grunts]

15:57.999 --> 15:59.584
[gasps]

16:09.051 --> 16:10.094
Check this out.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.638
[McKenna] What is that?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.223
[Alex] It looks
like a growth on her back.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.558
We don't know that.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.153
‐Ohh!
‐[McKenna] Oh, my God.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.198
Just like the drawing.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.616
[Alex]
It looks like a cocoon.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.284
Is there something in it?

16:33.284 --> 16:34.535
‐I don't know.
‐[McKenna] But what is it?

16:34.535 --> 16:37.246
[Violet]
It's a time bomb.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.459
[McKenna]
What do you mean?

16:41.459 --> 16:44.378
[Violet] If I play the game,
it goes away for a while.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.505
If I don't, it keeps growing.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.715
[Trey] And then what?

16:47.715 --> 16:49.884
[Violet]
I don't know. I die,

16:49.884 --> 16:52.053
the world ends,
take your pick.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.347
But trust me,
if you had any idea‐‐

16:54.347 --> 16:56.015
[McKenna]
What are you?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.975
Are you possessed?
Is this a cult or something?

16:57.975 --> 16:59.477
Alex, untie me!

16:59.477 --> 17:01.687
No. We know you've been
trying to blackmail her.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.898
And we know you've been watching
McKenna on her webcam, too.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.983
Thanks for telling me
about that, by the way.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.193
You set me up.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.611
Pretty easily,
I might add.

17:08.611 --> 17:11.113
Well, fine,

17:11.113 --> 17:13.074
but you're wasting your time.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.575
You can't dodge fate, McKenna.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.953
No, there's
got to be a way out.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.664
There is.
All but one of us dies.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.707
The survivor lives
to play another day.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.042
That's the curse of the game.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.585
The curse? What do you mean?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.337
Light as a Feather.
The game is cursed.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.089
The leader predicts
the player's death,

17:28.089 --> 17:30.383
and then they die in the way
that it was predicted.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.552
So it's really only cursed
for those who die then.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.554
No, trust me.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.307
Everyone in this game
is completely screwed.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.851
Then why would you
play the game with us
if you knew that?

17:40.851 --> 17:42.562
I didn't have a choice!
I didn't want this!

17:42.562 --> 17:45.189
‐I didn't ask for this!
‐That so, Class President?

17:45.189 --> 17:47.608
Because it looks
like you swooped in
and took over our lives!

17:47.608 --> 17:49.860
‐Al, just let her explain.
‐No!

17:49.860 --> 17:52.863
My body is falling apart.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.616
This disgusting thing in me

17:55.616 --> 17:57.577
is rotting me
from the inside,

17:57.577 --> 18:00.454
and if I don't play,
people I love start to die.

18:00.454 --> 18:04.417
My grandma was taken
to the hospital today.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.628
How do you know there's
not answers in the journal?

18:07.628 --> 18:09.505
There are scribblings
all over this thing.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.382
You don't think I've gone
over that shit a million times?

18:11.382 --> 18:12.925
How about this one?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.677
"This thing came
from some distant darkness.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.304
Maybe it'll go back someday."

18:16.304 --> 18:18.556
What does that mean?

18:18.556 --> 18:20.933
‐I don't know.
‐You have to know something!

18:20.933 --> 18:22.643
If this book is so useless,

18:22.643 --> 18:24.020
then why do you want it
back so bad?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.688
Screw this‐‐ Plan B.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.315
If we can't convince
you to help us,

18:27.315 --> 18:28.816
we're gonna make you.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.443
Really?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.445
How are you gonna do that?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.906
Oh, wait, don't tell me.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.700
I want it to be a surprise.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.495
[Violet]
Ow! Careful!

18:41.495 --> 18:44.040
[grunts] Jesus!

18:46.167 --> 18:48.919
Really? The bathtub?
This is your plan?

18:48.919 --> 18:50.296
Shut up.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.259
‐Can you guys
give us a second?
‐What for?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.802
‐Just a little girl talk.
‐Whoa!

18:56.802 --> 18:57.845
Alex, wait! Damn it, Alex!

18:57.845 --> 18:58.846
[Trey] What the hell?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.306
Sorry.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.184
‐[pounding on door]
‐[McKenna] Alex?!

19:03.184 --> 19:05.519
And then Alex the badass
went rogue.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.229
I'm impressed.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.648
You have 30 seconds
to start talking.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.941
Or what?
You're gonna choke me to death?

19:10.941 --> 19:13.569
[chuckles] Oh, wait.
That's your thing.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.656
Alex, hurting her is
not gonna accomplish anything!

19:16.656 --> 19:18.449
She's right.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.285
Something tells me that's
not gonna stop you anyway.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.662
You said if I brought you
back the journal,

19:22.662 --> 19:23.913
you would release me
from the game.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.581
How were you gonna do that?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.833
Sorry,
I can't tell you that.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.251
Stop screwing around.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.920
Tell me now, or else.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.088
Or else what?

19:32.088 --> 19:34.757
Come on, you can do it.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.426
Alex, what is going on?!
This was not part of the plan!

19:37.426 --> 19:39.178
C'mon, you know you want to.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.346
Tell me how to end this!

19:40.346 --> 19:42.098
‐[McKenna] Alex!
‐Now!

19:42.098 --> 19:43.349
‐C'mon, Trey.
‐[lock clicking]

19:45.851 --> 19:47.103
[Violet]
C'mon, you can do it.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.730
Just a little bit closer.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.524
Think of it this way.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.234
If you had choked on one
of your little beloved pills

19:53.234 --> 19:55.027
and Candace was still alive,

19:55.027 --> 19:56.195
do you think she would hesitate?

19:57.279 --> 19:59.615
Kill me <i>now!</i>

19:59.615 --> 20:00.616
Come on!

20:03.953 --> 20:05.371
[screaming]

20:05.371 --> 20:07.498
[electrical current buzzing]

20:12.294 --> 20:13.921
[buzzing stops]

20:25.975 --> 20:27.935
[McKenna] Oh, my God.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.520
[Henry]
We have to call the police.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.981
‐Alex will go to jail.
‐[McKenna] No. No!

20:31.981 --> 20:33.733
Do not say that!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.860
This was just a big
misunderstanding, right, Alex?

20:37.903 --> 20:40.740
No. No, it wasn't.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.826
You were supposed
to threaten her,

20:43.826 --> 20:45.786
not kill her!

20:45.786 --> 20:47.580
She deserved it.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.417
Oh, my God.
