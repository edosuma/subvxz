Improved by: @Ivandrofly

00:48.425 --> 00:51.541
Pinewood marriage chest
with groove joinery

00:51.716 --> 00:55.415
and hand-forged hinges in
the shape of tulip buds.

00:57.509 --> 00:59.168
Walnut sideboard.

00:59.342 --> 01:01.665
16th-century French decorations

01:01.841 --> 01:04.756
of herms and
Griffin-shaped cartouches.

01:04.924 --> 01:08.006
Embellished deplorably
in the 19th century.

01:10.302 --> 01:13.915
A pair of oak veneer cabinets
in the Flemish style.

01:14.093 --> 01:15.751
Upper section with two doors,

01:15.925 --> 01:19.209
featuring carved anthropomorphic
figures and caryatids.

01:26.093 --> 01:27.798
Something wrong, Mr. Oldman?

01:48.428 --> 01:49.706
Is it important?

01:50.011 --> 01:52.878
If you were kind enough to
let me have this as a gift,

01:53.054 --> 01:55.041
I'd be delighted to accept.

01:55.384 --> 01:57.211
I don't remember that.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.341
It may look like mouldy wood,

01:59.511 --> 02:01.631
but centuries ago,
beneath the mould,

02:01.968 --> 02:04.125
there must have been a painting.

02:55.887 --> 02:58.672
- Good evening. How are you?
- Very well.

04:04.557 --> 04:06.679
The management and
staff of Styrorex

04:06.849 --> 04:09.467
would like to offer our
best wishes, Mr. Oldman.

04:09.806 --> 04:11.963
Happy Birthday, Mr. Oldman.

04:12.140 --> 04:14.973
This year, our chefs wish
to dedicate in your honour

04:15.307 --> 04:17.678
an ancient recipe of a
Renaissance dessert

04:17.850 --> 04:20.303
made of choux cream
and bitter almonds.

04:24.892 --> 04:26.088
Enjoy.

04:31.557 --> 04:34.972
- Most likely a rash.
- Lt must be that.

04:53.017 --> 04:55.092
Was it not to your
taste, Mr. Oldman?

04:55.267 --> 04:58.882
Quite the contrary, but you
see, my birthday is tomorrow.

04:59.059 --> 05:03.266
It is now 10:35pm and
I'm very superstitious.

05:03.601 --> 05:05.057
Pretend I had accepted.

05:08.518 --> 05:10.307
The day after tomorrow, then.

05:13.059 --> 05:16.425
The director of the Vatican Museum
wants you to call him back.

05:16.601 --> 05:19.303
The reliquary attributed
to Cellini, I presume.

05:19.644 --> 05:21.218
The report on this is ready.

05:21.393 --> 05:24.096
There's a pile of gifts.
What shall I do with them?

05:24.269 --> 05:26.508
Send them to my house
except the mobile.

05:26.684 --> 05:28.723
Only one this year.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.718
Good. Word's out
that I hate them.

05:30.895 --> 05:34.342
Unless you've changed your habits,
you'll have to answer that.

05:34.519 --> 05:36.556
It's the first call
on your birthday.

05:37.726 --> 05:38.888
Tradition.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.590
Hello.

05:43.768 --> 05:46.056
I have no wish to
waste your time.

05:46.394 --> 05:48.884
- Who's speaking?
- It's me, Claire Ibbetson.

05:49.061 --> 05:50.683
Please don't hang up on me.

05:50.854 --> 05:53.635
You're Mr. Oldman's
secretary, aren't you?

05:53.810 --> 05:56.380
You can speak to me. It
makes no difference.

05:56.728 --> 05:59.809
You see, I... I don't know
anybody. I'm on my own.

05:59.979 --> 06:02.680
I'm sorry, Miss lbbetson,
this is not a helpline.

06:02.854 --> 06:04.891
I'm not explaining
myself very well.

06:05.062 --> 06:07.631
I'm not in the habit of
speaking to people much.

06:07.978 --> 06:10.514
That's a considerable
stroke of good fortune.

06:10.686 --> 06:13.388
- Talking to people is perilous.
- I'm desperate...

06:13.560 --> 06:15.966
You made the call so
you're running the risk.

06:16.146 --> 06:18.681
It's about the furniture
of my parents' villa.

06:18.855 --> 06:21.887
They... about a year ago.

06:22.062 --> 06:24.183
- You see?
- I understand.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.762
An estate of great...

06:25.937 --> 06:28.473
I've always heard it
referred to as being of...

06:28.645 --> 06:30.020
Extremely valuable.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.854
Very rare pieces,
including paintings.

06:33.187 --> 06:35.723
Unfortunately, I
have no photographs.

06:35.897 --> 06:37.057
So what?

06:37.228 --> 06:40.759
To be honest, I haven't decided
yet, but I would like to have a...

06:40.937 --> 06:43.306
Oh, I'm out of my depth.
What's the word?

06:43.479 --> 06:45.516
- Valuation.
- Exactly.

06:45.687 --> 06:49.054
That is why I asked to
speak to Mr. Oldman.

06:49.397 --> 06:52.347
Does Mr. Oldman have the
pleasure of knowing you?

06:52.521 --> 06:55.223
Oh, no, not at all.
He doesn't know me.

06:55.396 --> 06:57.268
But... but I know
a lot about him.

06:58.479 --> 07:01.763
Mr. Oldman's assistants are
responsible for assessments.

07:01.939 --> 07:05.766
- I'll put you through.
- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

07:05.938 --> 07:08.059
I must speak to
Mr. Oldman in person.

07:08.229 --> 07:11.229
Mr. Oldman never presides
over early appraisals.

07:11.563 --> 07:13.354
But you see, before he died,

07:13.522 --> 07:16.140
Dad told me that if I
decided to sell everything,

07:16.313 --> 07:19.312
I should entrust the auction
sale to Mr. Virgil Oldman.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.012
- In his opinion, the best.
- Sold!

07:23.189 --> 07:27.311
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to present lot 231,

07:27.647 --> 07:32.720
a refracting elongated telescope
constructed by Galileo Galilei.

07:33.064 --> 07:35.103
It's still in perfect
working order.

07:35.437 --> 07:37.844
Can we open bidding,
please, at 1,000,000?

07:38.189 --> 07:41.271
- 1,100,000.
- 1,100,000. 1,200,000.

07:41.565 --> 07:45.144
1,300,000. 1,400,000
on the telephone.

07:45.438 --> 07:48.106
1,500,000 back in the room.
1,600,000.

07:48.399 --> 07:51.264
1,700,000. 1,800,000
in the room.

07:51.564 --> 07:55.808
1,900,000. 2,000,000.
At 2,000,000.

07:56.107 --> 07:57.600
Gesundheit. Was that a bid?

07:57.900 --> 08:02.520
At 2,000,000. 2,100,000.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.971
2,300,000 on the telephone.

08:05.273 --> 08:07.808
2,500,000. I can sell it.
2,700,000.

08:08.107 --> 08:11.438
At 2,700,000. Any more?
Are we all done?

08:11.733 --> 08:13.522
At 2,700,000.

08:14.609 --> 08:16.265
Sold. Congratulations, Sir.

08:16.565 --> 08:18.437
Lot 232.

08:18.608 --> 08:22.469
Disciple of Boris Gregorian,
Thurst. Oil on canvas, 60 x 70.

08:22.775 --> 08:24.645
This one will go
to the best offer.

08:25.816 --> 08:28.731
1,000. 2,000.

08:29.901 --> 08:33.765
3,000. 4,000. 5,000 online.

08:34.817 --> 08:38.063
6,000. 7,000.

08:38.357 --> 08:41.724
8,000. 9,000 on the telephone.

08:42.025 --> 08:44.479
10,000 back in the room.
11,000 online.

08:44.776 --> 08:48.188
12,000. 13,000 online.
14,000. 15,000.

08:48.359 --> 08:51.557
This is not doing
my neck any good.

08:51.859 --> 08:53.601
At 15,000.

08:55.693 --> 08:57.980
20,000. At 20,000.

08:58.151 --> 08:59.808
Any more? Sold!

10:13.444 --> 10:17.771
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. Very.

10:18.070 --> 10:20.819
You never miss a trick,
do you, governor?

10:24.363 --> 10:26.354
- Who is it really?
- Yansky.

10:26.656 --> 10:29.109
A Russian painter who
died in the late '30s.

10:29.405 --> 10:31.359
An outstanding
landscape painter.

10:32.737 --> 10:36.315
But among his many landscapes,
he painted three portraits.

10:37.362 --> 10:39.188
Only three in his whole life.

10:40.322 --> 10:41.861
And this is one of the three.

10:44.864 --> 10:46.570
It's double, alright?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.605
How long have we
known each other?

10:49.905 --> 10:50.982
Quite a while.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.727
We've pulled off some sharp
tricks time after time.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.523
Remember Milo Hensen?

10:56.697 --> 10:59.779
You were the only one who
knew he was going to be big.

10:59.948 --> 11:02.481
We got that portrait of
his mother for a song

11:02.780 --> 11:06.111
from under the noses of
that bunch of idiots.

11:06.405 --> 11:07.780
Must be worth a fortune now.

11:07.946 --> 11:10.351
You almost sound bitter
you didn't get more.

11:10.656 --> 11:13.227
Have we ever talked about
money, you and me?

11:13.406 --> 11:15.941
- Honestly, no.
- It's been good enough for you.

11:16.115 --> 11:18.353
It's been good enough
for me, you misery.

11:18.532 --> 11:20.688
What matters is that
you're satisfied.

11:20.990 --> 11:24.107
My only regret is never
being able to persuade you

11:24.406 --> 11:27.652
that my paintings are evidence
of a great artistic talent.

11:27.947 --> 11:30.521
A love of art and knowing
how to hold a brush

11:30.823 --> 11:32.197
doesn't make an artist.

11:32.364 --> 11:35.565
You need an inner mystery. A
knack you've never possessed.

11:35.865 --> 11:38.982
You're right. Double
wasn't enough.

13:55.661 --> 13:58.410
In my 36 years in this business,

13:58.577 --> 14:02.192
never has anyone had the gall
to keep me waiting 40 minutes.

14:02.369 --> 14:05.036
It's a disgrace. A
display of bad manners.

14:05.203 --> 14:07.444
Let me explain. I
tried to call.

14:07.621 --> 14:09.694
- There's no excuse.
- I tried to call.

14:09.870 --> 14:11.659
Never come near me again.

14:11.829 --> 14:14.695
Nobody answered and I don't
have your mobile number.

14:14.869 --> 14:16.943
I do not possess a mobile phone.

14:24.912 --> 14:27.401
It's the lbbetson
woman on the phone.

14:27.704 --> 14:30.406
- Tell her to go to hell.
- She's crying.

14:30.702 --> 14:32.029
Serves her right.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.359
She was hit by a car on
her way to meet you.

14:34.538 --> 14:37.405
So much the worse for her.
It's no concern of mine.

14:37.704 --> 14:39.113
She was left unconscious.

14:39.288 --> 14:42.488
She was lying in a pool of blood
when the ambulance arrived.

14:43.871 --> 14:46.194
Alright. Put her through.

14:52.663 --> 14:55.069
- Yes?
- Please forgive me.

14:55.372 --> 14:59.779
I had no intention to be
in any way disrespectful.

14:59.954 --> 15:01.909
Nothing too serious, I hope.

15:02.079 --> 15:05.446
No. Fortunately, they'll...
they'll let me out tomorrow.

15:05.622 --> 15:08.740
Good. I hope you make
a speedy recovery.

15:08.914 --> 15:10.950
Would you consent to
a new appointment?

15:12.079 --> 15:15.030
- Please.
- Alright.

15:15.204 --> 15:17.195
But I'm sending an assistant.

15:17.372 --> 15:20.370
I hope it's the same one
I spoke to last time.

15:23.122 --> 15:24.285
What do you mean?

15:24.456 --> 15:27.619
Well, I can't explain it, but
I understood from the outset

15:27.790 --> 15:31.284
that voice could only have
been yours, Mr. Oldman.

15:31.580 --> 15:34.116
Truly surprising,
wouldn't you say?

15:34.290 --> 15:37.074
We think we'll be able to
bring out the whole face,

15:37.247 --> 15:40.331
part of her dress and the
left side of the background.

15:40.625 --> 15:43.823
Incredible. But what made
Mr. Oldman think that?

15:44.123 --> 15:46.741
- What period is it from?
- Too soon to say.

15:46.914 --> 15:49.450
Perhaps Mr. Oldman will
be able to work this out

15:49.623 --> 15:51.744
more quickly and better than us.

15:53.665 --> 15:56.118
- It's a fake.
- How is that possible?

15:56.417 --> 15:58.572
- It's beautiful!
- I didn't say it wasn't.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.243
I said it wasn't authentic.

16:00.416 --> 16:02.784
From an analysis of the
pigments and wood,

16:03.081 --> 16:04.987
we thought it was
pre-17th century.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.701
- Even older.
- Then it must be worth something.

16:07.873 --> 16:12.412
It is a work by Valiante, the
female forger of the 16th century.

16:12.707 --> 16:14.033
She copied masterpieces,

16:14.206 --> 16:16.661
but couldn't sign them
as she was a woman,

16:16.957 --> 16:19.079
so she marked them
with a personal code

16:19.375 --> 16:21.117
hidden in the folds
of the drapery

16:21.417 --> 16:23.702
or in this case, in the
gaze of the subject.

16:23.999 --> 16:27.116
The beam of light on the
Iris is nothing if not a V.

16:27.292 --> 16:28.748
That is Valiante.

16:28.915 --> 16:33.490
It is worth something, but nothing
compared to the original.

16:55.293 --> 16:58.409
- Are you Mr. Oldman's assistant?
- Yes.

16:58.708 --> 17:00.994
I'm Fred, the caretaker.
Pleased to meet you.

17:02.876 --> 17:05.542
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

17:06.417 --> 17:07.448
And Miss lbbetson?

17:08.751 --> 17:09.994
She sends her apologies,

17:10.167 --> 17:12.738
but overnight, she was
running a temperature.

17:12.917 --> 17:16.531
She should have called me.
Spared myself a wasted trip.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.540
Well, give her my best wishes.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.377
She asked if you would
go ahead with valuation.

17:21.544 --> 17:23.700
She's instructed me
to show you around.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.454
Everything's at your disposal.
Come with me.

17:31.959 --> 17:34.580
Miss lbbetson was hoping
to meet your boss.

17:34.751 --> 17:37.833
It doesn't matter. Your
mistress didn't show up either.

17:38.002 --> 17:39.165
Fair enough.

17:39.335 --> 17:41.621
I suppose it'll get
the job done quicker.

17:48.044 --> 17:49.454
Forgive the mess.

17:50.586 --> 17:54.498
It's gone to wrack and ruin ever
since Miss lbbetson's parents died.

17:56.585 --> 17:57.829
Let's go up.

17:59.793 --> 18:01.666
How long since the owners died?

18:01.836 --> 18:04.586
By the look of it, you'd
think it was centuries ago,

18:04.753 --> 18:06.376
but it's only been one year.

18:06.669 --> 18:10.368
First Mrs. Ibbetson and then,
scarcely 45 days later,

18:10.546 --> 18:11.789
poor Mr. Ibbetson.

18:11.961 --> 18:14.628
You have a good look.
Take your time.

18:14.795 --> 18:16.750
Just getting these
curtains open.

18:18.336 --> 18:20.162
Too many windows in this room.

18:25.922 --> 18:26.998
Okay.

18:31.297 --> 18:34.164
How many brothers and sisters
does Miss lbbetson have?

18:34.337 --> 18:35.878
None. She is an only child.

18:36.173 --> 18:37.911
- Is she married?
- No.

18:38.087 --> 18:40.707
- Has she ever been?
- No, no.

18:40.878 --> 18:43.083
I don't think she
even has a boyfriend.

18:43.255 --> 18:46.586
- Grandparents, aunts, uncles?
- No, none at all.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.629
As far as I know, Miss
lbbetson is on her own.

18:53.755 --> 18:54.785
So many rooms.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.575
You know, I've never
managed to count them all.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.834
Have there been other
valuations before me?

19:17.006 --> 19:19.541
Absolutely none.
Yours is the first.

19:19.839 --> 19:22.672
Miss lbbetson is extremely
fond of this house.

19:22.839 --> 19:24.499
Maybe too fond.

19:24.674 --> 19:27.586
She'd prefer to keep everything,
but what can you do?

19:27.880 --> 19:30.713
The empire crumbles. A woman
on her own can't cope.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.089
Is she thinking of putting the
house up for sale as well?

19:35.258 --> 19:37.876
That, I don't know.
Maybe a part of it.

19:38.175 --> 19:40.080
She won't get rid
of the whole place.

19:40.381 --> 19:42.124
What kind of work does she do?

19:42.423 --> 19:45.704
I couldn't say. I only
dealt with her parents.

19:48.674 --> 19:50.960
- May I see the cellars?
- It's this way.

19:52.258 --> 19:53.797
It's a long way down.

19:59.176 --> 20:00.335
Go ahead.

20:43.925 --> 20:45.121
I honestly don't get it.

20:45.426 --> 20:48.507
In the time I've known you,
I've never seen you beaten.

20:48.801 --> 20:51.714
I've watched you produce
all manner of gadgets

20:51.883 --> 20:53.840
from most unremarkable ironwork.

20:54.133 --> 20:56.753
Optical, arithmetical
devices, water clocks...

20:57.053 --> 21:01.341
Even that hairdryer that probably dried
the locks of Jules Verne's wife.

21:01.634 --> 21:04.881
But you've nothing to say about
this curious contraption?

21:05.177 --> 21:07.924
I'm surprised that an art
connoisseur like yourself

21:08.094 --> 21:10.923
can get so carried away by
a banal piece of ironwork.

21:11.093 --> 21:13.760
It's not the object that
arouses my curiosity,

21:13.927 --> 21:15.301
but it's contradiction.

21:15.593 --> 21:18.544
- Contradiction?
- Look.

21:18.718 --> 21:22.133
I found it in this position in
contact with damp flooring,

21:22.427 --> 21:26.337
but the rust is all along the top
of the cogs, nowhere near the damp.

21:26.635 --> 21:27.747
What does this mean?

21:28.052 --> 21:30.506
The object hadn't been
there for very long.

21:30.803 --> 21:34.631
It got rusted in some other place.
Or someone turned it upside down.

21:34.804 --> 21:38.133
That's all, nothing more than a
useless exercise in deduction.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.962
Hi. Did you manage it?

21:40.136 --> 21:41.414
Did you ever doubt me?

21:41.760 --> 21:44.295
This works perfectly now.

21:45.093 --> 21:47.964
And I transcribed the
recording from the tape.

21:48.137 --> 21:50.174
You're a genius. How
much do I owe you?

21:50.346 --> 21:51.720
Oh, nothing.

21:52.054 --> 21:53.759
Maybe you'll invite me out.

21:53.928 --> 21:55.006
Count on it.

21:55.343 --> 21:57.914
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes, you can!

21:58.261 --> 21:59.422
That I am good at.

21:59.761 --> 22:01.586
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

22:01.929 --> 22:05.377
William-Adolphe Bouguereau.
The Birth Of Venus.

22:08.345 --> 22:09.375
Authentic.

22:12.763 --> 22:16.458
Umberto Veruda,
The Honest, 1890.

22:34.888 --> 22:37.671
You've been the talk
of the town lately.

22:38.013 --> 22:39.670
I hoped to see you on TV.

22:39.845 --> 22:42.678
I don't like to appear. I
prefer to remain in shadow.

22:42.847 --> 22:44.422
We're much the same that way.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.302
That doesn't mean we'll agree.

22:46.471 --> 22:48.546
My secretary's been
looking for you.

22:48.721 --> 22:51.719
How do you know that a painter
will become collectable?

22:51.889 --> 22:55.503
Intuition, which also makes
me doubt your intentions.

22:55.679 --> 22:59.720
Sorry for that impression but I've
entrusted you with my belongings.

22:59.890 --> 23:01.217
That's not how it works.

23:01.389 --> 23:04.341
There must be a signed
contract before the inventory.

23:04.514 --> 23:07.215
It takes time, and unless
you stop fooling around

23:07.388 --> 23:10.091
and decide to come out it
will never get started.

23:10.264 --> 23:12.339
Go ahead with the inventory.

23:12.514 --> 23:13.972
I'll meet you at the villa.

23:14.139 --> 23:15.763
We'll reach an agreement.

23:15.933 --> 23:17.340
You have my word.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.754
- Take these.
- Yes.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.010
Be careful!

23:21.182 --> 23:23.301
I'm not sure but it
looks German to me.

23:23.473 --> 23:25.964
Austrian. Careful with that.

23:26.142 --> 23:28.344
It's 11:00 The
appointment was 8:30.

23:28.515 --> 23:32.176
She's not answering. She said
she'll come. She'll be here.

23:32.515 --> 23:34.719
The piano doesn't
need restoration.

23:34.891 --> 23:35.921
Quite so.

23:36.099 --> 23:38.136
We have to check it
but there's no key.

23:38.306 --> 23:39.549
But here it is.

23:39.722 --> 23:41.594
Last time there was no key.

23:41.765 --> 23:42.844
Looks good.

23:43.184 --> 23:45.008
Mr. Oldman!

23:45.184 --> 23:47.137
Would you help me
with the bookcase?

23:47.473 --> 23:50.258
Italian bookcase, wood.
First half of...

23:50.432 --> 23:51.461
Who smashed this?

23:51.639 --> 23:53.964
Nobody, Mr. Oldman, it
was already broken.

23:54.140 --> 23:56.096
Is this part of the
house inhabited?

23:56.265 --> 23:57.462
Why?

23:57.639 --> 23:59.548
There have been some changes.

23:59.892 --> 24:01.089
No, no, Mr...

24:01.267 --> 24:03.341
I'm sorry, I'm not
sure of your name.

24:03.517 --> 24:04.795
I thought you were...

24:05.141 --> 24:06.598
It doesn't matter who I am.

24:06.933 --> 24:08.305
Nobody lives here.

24:08.640 --> 24:12.006
Be that as it may, if your
mistress is not here by midday

24:12.183 --> 24:15.016
I will have no option but
to suspend operations.

24:20.184 --> 24:21.262
Mr. Oldman!

24:26.099 --> 24:27.214
Miss lbbetson.

24:27.559 --> 24:29.429
Hello, Mr. Oldman?

24:29.599 --> 24:32.053
Mr. Oldman, can you hear me?

24:32.225 --> 24:35.840
Mr. Oldman, I apologise.
What must you think of me?

24:36.017 --> 24:38.802
Spare me the self-serving
justifications.

24:38.976 --> 24:40.006
Let me speak.

24:40.185 --> 24:43.550
I cannot touch your things without
a contract. Is that clear?

24:43.724 --> 24:46.593
Would you leave it on the
table in the hallway?

24:46.768 --> 24:49.256
I'll sign it. I accept
all your conditions.

24:49.435 --> 24:51.141
Yes, but I do not accept yours.

24:51.309 --> 24:54.722
I will not do business with a
silly, superficial phantom.

24:56.310 --> 24:57.803
Be careful!

24:57.978 --> 25:00.179
I understand your exasperation.

25:00.351 --> 25:03.136
But please believe me I
didn't mean anything by it.

25:03.309 --> 25:07.553
It's been a series of unfortunate,
unintentional mishaps.

25:07.894 --> 25:10.049
So what exactly happened today?

25:10.226 --> 25:14.303
My car was stolen and I had to
go to the police to report it.

25:15.061 --> 25:17.550
Which police station
did you go to?

25:17.727 --> 25:19.718
- The one in the city.
- Whereabouts?

25:20.062 --> 25:22.678
- On the main square.
- Which square?

25:22.977 --> 25:25.181
No more interrogation!

25:25.352 --> 25:27.676
No more! Who do you
think you are?

25:32.812 --> 25:34.518
Are you here, Miss lbbetson?

25:34.687 --> 25:36.925
What kind of question is that?

25:37.102 --> 25:38.298
Are you here?

25:38.476 --> 25:40.801
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

25:40.978 --> 25:43.181
- If you're here, come out now.
- Stop it!

25:43.353 --> 25:46.635
Explain the meaning of this game
which I do not find amusing.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.850
Call me tonight. I'll explain.

25:52.227 --> 25:54.136
It's the same material

25:54.311 --> 25:56.101
and the same workmanship too.

25:56.437 --> 25:58.309
These belong to the same system.

25:58.646 --> 26:01.217
There's no signature,
no inscription?

26:01.562 --> 26:07.143
I mean when I've got the rust and the
oxidisation off the other piece.

26:08.562 --> 26:09.592
There's nothing.

26:09.939 --> 26:14.890
I can do the same with these but, I
mean, right now I can't see anything.

26:18.646 --> 26:20.552
What have you found?

26:20.896 --> 26:24.096
The technique, how the cog has
been attached to it's axis.

26:24.270 --> 26:26.843
It's really old. I've
never seen it before.

26:27.022 --> 26:29.144
Here, look. Have a look.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.182
It's 18th century.

26:39.522 --> 26:41.512
We could be onto
something big here.

26:41.690 --> 26:43.559
Could you guess what it is?

26:45.022 --> 26:48.056
Three pieces of the mosaic
is not enough, Mr. Oldman.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.557
In the last few years the
old couple were unwell.

26:52.730 --> 26:55.016
The house was in a
terrible state then.

26:56.271 --> 26:59.804
Mr. lbbetson always said that
they'd have to sell something.

27:00.148 --> 27:02.103
And Miss Claire. How old is she?

27:03.940 --> 27:05.562
About 27.

27:06.941 --> 27:09.344
What else can you
tell me about her?

27:09.522 --> 27:10.850
Nothing really.

27:11.189 --> 27:14.435
I've never had much to do with
her. I don't really know her.

27:14.773 --> 27:18.932
And yet you've been in the service
of the lbbetsons for about 10 years.

27:21.190 --> 27:23.894
Well, 11 years to be exact.

27:24.273 --> 27:26.181
I don't have much
to do with her.

27:26.523 --> 27:28.809
I talk to her often
at all hours but...

27:29.148 --> 27:30.523
But?

27:30.857 --> 27:32.896
I've never seen her.

27:33.273 --> 27:36.770
- How could that be?
- It's the truth. Not once.

27:37.107 --> 27:38.648
Why?

27:40.692 --> 27:45.432
Because Miss Claire suffers
from a very strange illness.

27:46.607 --> 27:49.474
- Hello.
- Good evening. It's Oldman.

27:49.648 --> 27:51.106
I was expecting your call.

27:51.274 --> 27:54.854
I have no wish to quarrel and
I'm sorry if I was rude today.

27:55.025 --> 27:56.102
It doesn't matter.

27:56.274 --> 27:59.143
But if I confirm I am
available, at the same time

27:59.317 --> 28:02.766
I cannot permit this joke in poor
taste to continue any longer.

28:03.108 --> 28:05.726
I wish you to stop all
involvement in my affairs.

28:05.899 --> 28:07.605
I apologize for the trouble.

28:07.774 --> 28:09.730
Send me your bill. Good night.

28:17.775 --> 28:20.145
Lot 93. Valiante.
Portrait of a Lady.

28:20.317 --> 28:21.347
16th century,

28:21.525 --> 28:25.021
inspired by the Portrait of a
Young Girl by Petrus Christus.

28:25.192 --> 28:26.307
Oil on wood. 30 x 40.

28:26.651 --> 28:29.056
I have here an opening
bid of £20,000.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.937
- £22,000.
- £22,000.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.060
£24,000. £26,000
on the telephone.

28:35.234 --> 28:38.397
£28,000 in the room. £30,000.

28:38.734 --> 28:40.523
£35,000. Thank you, Sir.

28:41.318 --> 28:44.602
£40,000 on the telephone.
£45,000 in the room.

28:44.778 --> 28:46.104
£50,000.

28:46.443 --> 28:50.934
£55,000. £60,000. £65,000
on the telephone.

28:51.276 --> 28:53.896
£70,000. At £70,000.

28:54.068 --> 28:58.191
Any advance on £70,000? £75,000.

28:58.526 --> 29:00.565
£80,000 on the telephone.
Any more?

29:00.735 --> 29:02.607
All done at £80,000.

29:02.944 --> 29:04.602
All done at £80,000.

29:05.860 --> 29:08.646
£90,000. Any more?

29:09.695 --> 29:10.938
Sold.

29:12.276 --> 29:14.849
- Thank you, Sir.
- I bid £90,000 too.

29:15.195 --> 29:18.145
Mr. Oldman should have
been aware of that.

29:18.485 --> 29:22.016
I don't believe so, Mrs Derain.
Mr Whistler bid £90,000.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.643
- He was the only one.
- They bid simultaneously.

29:25.821 --> 29:28.225
She got her bid in first.
I saw it.

29:28.569 --> 29:29.942
What should we do?

29:30.111 --> 29:34.485
I'm the biggest collector of
Valiante forgeries and I'll Sue you!

29:34.821 --> 29:38.399
You were too slow, Billy! You didn't
get in with your bid in time.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.441
And you were too late. Too late.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.898
You didn't keep up with
me for God's sake!

29:43.235 --> 29:46.069
She was behind me. If I'd
seen I'd have bid again.

29:46.402 --> 29:48.276
You're losing it!

29:48.445 --> 29:49.559
Maybe you're right

29:49.736 --> 29:52.355
but it's not the first
time we've messed up.

29:52.697 --> 29:56.191
It's the way things go. Never went
into a rage like this before.

29:57.987 --> 29:59.777
That wasn't a Valiante forgery.

30:00.111 --> 30:02.565
It was the genuine one
by Petrus Christus.

30:03.402 --> 30:05.858
It'll be worth £8 million.

30:08.029 --> 30:09.689
Woe be me.

30:11.404 --> 30:13.277
I'm sorry. Honestly.

30:14.862 --> 30:17.943
But even when we lost Van
Gogh's Lady With The Fan

30:18.113 --> 30:19.937
you didn't take it this hard.

30:20.779 --> 30:22.487
What's going on, Virgil?

30:26.489 --> 30:28.361
642.

30:28.531 --> 30:30.071
729.

30:31.613 --> 30:33.982
918.

30:34.154 --> 30:36.393
1,011.

30:36.737 --> 30:40.069
1,119.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.729
1,320.

30:43.073 --> 30:45.313
1,404.

30:45.655 --> 30:47.860
- What will you have?
- 1,581.

30:48.030 --> 30:49.061
Tea, thank you.

30:52.572 --> 30:54.230
8,109.

30:54.573 --> 30:56.529
8,725.

30:56.864 --> 30:59.946
Sorry, darling, 8,625.

31:00.116 --> 31:02.684
8,725!

31:03.072 --> 31:05.146
8,725.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.360
Take a closer look, you moron.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.779
Shit! You're right, 8,725.
Well done, girl!

31:10.948 --> 31:12.405
That's it?

31:24.323 --> 31:25.864
- Bye!
- Bye!

31:28.990 --> 31:31.859
I gave them a clean with
this special fluid.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.907
And I have studied
them by the millimeter

31:35.074 --> 31:37.360
and look what's come up.

31:38.408 --> 31:39.439
Vaucanson.

31:40.991 --> 31:43.692
I can't believe it!
Jacques Vaucanson.

31:43.866 --> 31:46.022
18th century constructor
of automata.

31:46.366 --> 31:49.115
When I was a student I
did my thesis on him.

31:49.450 --> 31:51.275
That's incredible!

31:51.451 --> 31:54.614
One of his most famous
androids even managed to talk.

31:54.783 --> 31:58.031
Exactly. People would pay
to ask it questions.

31:58.200 --> 32:03.071
The android would move it's
head, bow, and give it's reply.

32:03.452 --> 32:05.320
I bet there was someone inside.

32:05.491 --> 32:06.948
You know, a dwarf maybe.

32:07.116 --> 32:10.814
Just like Edgar Allan Poe suspected
with Maelzel's Chess Player.

32:10.991 --> 32:13.196
More than likely.

32:13.368 --> 32:15.652
But the mystery that
nobody could explain

32:15.825 --> 32:18.659
was how Vaucanson's automaton
always got it right.

32:19.034 --> 32:22.317
Of course there was trickery
in making the automaton talk.

32:23.868 --> 32:25.526
Everything it said was true.

32:27.159 --> 32:28.902
You bring me all the pieces.

32:29.075 --> 32:33.152
I promise to put them back together
exactly how Vaucanson had them.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.569
I don't doubt it

32:34.742 --> 32:37.861
but I fear I've lost my chance
to get the missing pieces.

32:38.201 --> 32:40.821
They must be in the same
place you found these.

32:41.161 --> 32:43.400
And all I need is 80%
of the elements,

32:43.578 --> 32:46.443
and I can work out the rest
and rebuild it myself.

32:46.618 --> 32:48.525
It's not that easy.

32:50.117 --> 32:52.157
I'm sorry. That's my girlfriend.

32:53.412 --> 32:56.113
Hey, Sarah, this is
Mr. Virgil Oldman.

33:00.369 --> 33:01.991
Pleased to meet you, Sarah.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.194
It's a pleasure. Robert has
told me so much about you.

33:05.369 --> 33:08.367
Don't young people talk
about more exciting things?

33:08.704 --> 33:10.362
Why don't you eat with us?

33:10.537 --> 33:12.907
That's very kind. Another
time, thank you.

33:13.287 --> 33:15.739
Alright, we won't insist.
We'll promise.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.784
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

33:24.161 --> 33:27.574
Cancel New York and tell the
Alphasons to meet us here.

33:27.912 --> 33:29.569
We called the meeting.

33:29.953 --> 33:32.820
So we've changed our minds.
Is that a problem?

33:33.162 --> 33:34.359
Alright, Mr. Oldman.

33:39.412 --> 33:41.117
Claire lbbetson phoned.

33:42.330 --> 33:43.608
What does she want now?

33:43.954 --> 33:45.861
She asked you to
meet her at 2:30.

33:46.205 --> 33:47.992
Meet her where?

33:48.330 --> 33:50.236
At the lbbetson villa.

33:50.412 --> 33:51.822
Where else?

34:48.081 --> 34:52.572
I'm extremely grateful to
you for coming, Mr. Oldman.

34:54.164 --> 34:56.286
How did you know it was me?

34:56.456 --> 34:58.661
Fred has a limp. You don't.

34:58.831 --> 35:00.371
Ah.

35:01.956 --> 35:04.824
To be honest I didn't expect
you'd want to speak to me.

35:06.165 --> 35:09.827
I know you can't stand my excuses.
If I were you, I wouldn't either.

35:09.997 --> 35:12.617
In fact, your beh...
How should I put it?

35:12.790 --> 35:14.413
Speak frankly. Don't worry.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.701
I won't deny that your
whimsical little ways

35:18.873 --> 35:20.331
are getting a bit tiresome.

35:22.416 --> 35:23.957
I hope not too tiresome.

35:25.292 --> 35:29.498
But I wanted to say sorry for...
well, my behavior.

35:30.540 --> 35:34.036
Typical of a "silly, superficial
woman", as you put it.

35:34.209 --> 35:36.955
Why do you systematically
avoid meeting me?

35:37.124 --> 35:39.247
Nothing personal, believe me.

35:39.418 --> 35:41.904
Why would you want to do
business with a person

35:42.250 --> 35:44.241
who arouses such aversion in you

35:44.417 --> 35:46.987
that you can't even
look him in the face?

35:47.458 --> 35:50.410
It's hard to explain. You
won't believe me anyway.

35:50.750 --> 35:55.122
If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't
be here playing hide and seek.

35:55.293 --> 35:56.749
I don't meet many people.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.158
It's been a long time now.

36:00.335 --> 36:03.332
I see nothing serious in that.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.698
Everyone has moments

36:04.875 --> 36:07.577
when they prefer solitude
to the multitudes.

36:07.750 --> 36:10.583
I haven't left this
house since I was 15.

36:11.417 --> 36:14.581
- I don't think I understand.
- You understand perfectly.

36:14.917 --> 36:16.328
This is my room.

36:16.501 --> 36:19.120
If there's somebody in the
house or in the villa,

36:19.293 --> 36:21.331
I lock myself up in here.

36:21.502 --> 36:25.198
I've always done that, even
when my parents were here.

36:25.376 --> 36:26.997
I hardly ever saw them.

36:27.167 --> 36:28.366
I don't see anybody.

36:29.334 --> 36:30.413
But why?

36:30.585 --> 36:33.785
Why do you go around with
your hands covered by gloves?

36:33.959 --> 36:36.958
It's a question of hygiene.
I don't see the connection.

36:37.127 --> 36:38.999
You're afraid to touch others.

36:39.170 --> 36:41.455
To touch their possessions
disgusts you.

36:41.794 --> 36:44.661
I'm afraid of going to
places where others live.

36:44.834 --> 36:47.619
These seem to me very
similar personal choices.

36:48.794 --> 36:52.492
You'd like me to believe you haven't
walked a street in 12 years?

36:52.836 --> 36:54.032
I see you know my age.

36:54.377 --> 36:58.288
Being a hermit and employing
a caretaker doesn't add up.

36:58.627 --> 37:01.909
I walk about quite a bit, if
that's what you want to know,

37:02.086 --> 37:05.203
inside the villa when
there's nobody here,

37:05.378 --> 37:08.329
which is often now,
but I never go out.

37:09.503 --> 37:11.658
The very idea paralyses me.

37:14.336 --> 37:16.374
I hope you understand me now.

37:16.710 --> 37:19.995
I hope that, within the limits
of your work, you'll help me.

37:21.338 --> 37:23.293
You have my word, Miss lbbetson.

37:23.462 --> 37:26.873
As to any agreement between us, I
leave it to you to set your fee.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.324
I trust you blindly.

37:31.753 --> 37:33.626
Leave the contract on the table.

37:33.961 --> 37:35.789
You'll find it signed next time.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.540
Now, please, I'm very tired.

37:50.339 --> 37:52.626
Apart from your
fondness for my gloves,

37:52.965 --> 37:55.001
what made you decide
to call me again?

37:55.172 --> 37:56.498
I haven't been kind.

37:57.629 --> 38:01.043
I was taken by the way you were
looking at my house yesterday

38:01.214 --> 38:02.623
from the bar opposite.

38:06.463 --> 38:08.420
You found the missing pieces.

38:08.589 --> 38:12.204
In the meantime make
do with this one.

38:12.380 --> 38:14.455
How much would the
automaton be worth

38:14.631 --> 38:16.917
if we manage to make it work?

38:17.089 --> 38:18.995
Think of a really,
really high figure.

38:21.173 --> 38:23.625
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.044
You've probably
pitched it too low.

38:26.380 --> 38:29.130
You're good at talking
without saying anything.

38:29.465 --> 38:31.586
I'll take that as a compliment.

38:32.215 --> 38:34.536
Should things go the
way I trust they will,

38:34.715 --> 38:36.751
you'll be very
handsomely rewarded.

38:37.090 --> 38:41.035
I didn't mean to talk about money.
It's a real privilege for me.

38:41.214 --> 38:42.791
Where did you find these?

38:43.132 --> 38:46.332
There are very precise rules
in the world of antiques.

38:46.508 --> 38:48.794
It's forbidden to
reveal one's sources.

38:57.464 --> 39:00.380
There's a few more gears
but bigger in that corner.

39:00.549 --> 39:04.081
Gather them together. I'll take
care of the cataloguing myself.

39:04.257 --> 39:05.288
Of course.

39:06.425 --> 39:07.621
Candlesticks.

39:07.799 --> 39:10.548
- Which period?
- 17th-century. Repair.

39:12.465 --> 39:13.543
Mr. Oldman.

39:19.383 --> 39:20.662
Mr. Oldman.

39:21.842 --> 39:23.004
Yes.

39:23.174 --> 39:26.173
What have you decided about
the furniture in this wing?

39:26.343 --> 39:28.414
We're only drawing
up the inventory.

39:28.591 --> 39:30.710
Later you can tell me
what to leave out.

39:30.882 --> 39:31.961
Thank you.

39:34.092 --> 39:38.168
Listen, Miss lbbetson, I can't help
thinking about your situation.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.746
I'm sorry to have intruded
on your thoughts.

39:40.924 --> 39:42.500
That's not the point.

39:42.675 --> 39:45.295
I've been wondering how
you can live like this.

39:45.467 --> 39:47.540
I'm organized and
self-sufficient,

39:47.717 --> 39:50.549
I don't need any help but I
appreciate your concern.

39:50.717 --> 39:52.045
You're welcome.

39:54.842 --> 39:57.377
- See you soon, then.
- Have a good day.

39:59.716 --> 40:00.878
Mr. Oldman!

40:02.968 --> 40:04.341
Your contract.

40:20.259 --> 40:22.086
I read it and it
seems fine to me.

40:22.468 --> 40:24.956
I initialed every page
and signed the last.

40:25.135 --> 40:26.959
That's how it's done, isn't it?

40:27.135 --> 40:28.248
Perfect.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.712
But your personal
details are missing.

40:34.469 --> 40:35.961
Take them from my passport.

40:46.552 --> 40:48.542
But it expired quite
some time ago.

40:48.718 --> 40:52.297
- Personal details never expire.
- That's true enough, I suppose.

40:52.469 --> 40:55.337
I was just a girl then but
it'll do for your purposes.

41:10.303 --> 41:13.172
I wanted to mention that
in certain critical cases

41:13.346 --> 41:16.094
my advice is to proceed
directly to restoration.

41:16.262 --> 41:17.459
You know best.

41:17.637 --> 41:20.385
It means the whole thing
will take a little longer.

41:20.554 --> 41:22.875
We can widen the scope
of the valuation.

41:23.220 --> 41:24.333
I understand.

41:39.471 --> 41:41.544
You dye your hair.
I never noticed.

41:41.888 --> 41:45.549
I'm disgusted by people who
don't trust their own hair!

41:45.722 --> 41:48.554
I don't trust people who
think so much of themselves

41:48.722 --> 41:50.548
that they won't come outside.

41:51.972 --> 41:55.917
Ah, Sir, there'll be no more
caretaker service as from Monday.

41:56.097 --> 41:59.047
I'll just come in to bring
Miss lbbetson her shopping.

41:59.221 --> 42:02.339
- The matter is of no interest to me.
- These are the keys.

42:03.473 --> 42:07.548
- Why give them to me?
- It's what Miss lbbetson wanted.

42:07.722 --> 42:10.589
In case you needed access
for further inspection.

42:13.432 --> 42:15.503
When you come in, slam the door,

42:15.848 --> 42:18.301
otherwise she'll get
scared and panic.

42:30.724 --> 42:32.430
I'm going off my head

42:32.599 --> 42:35.347
trying to work out the
alignment of these devices,

42:35.513 --> 42:38.216
trying to figure out which
one fitted into which.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.760
- That can't be easy.
- But not impossible.

42:42.265 --> 42:44.717
You know, gearboxes
are like people.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.845
If they've been
together long enough,

42:48.015 --> 42:50.503
eventually, they take
on each other's forms.

42:51.432 --> 42:55.756
So, you believe time can make any
kind of cohabitation possible?

42:55.932 --> 42:57.507
Yeah, well, absolutely.

42:57.850 --> 43:01.096
You've reminded me of a friend
who met a much younger girl.

43:01.266 --> 43:02.807
She had agoraphobia.

43:03.141 --> 43:05.296
Fear of open spaces
and distances?

43:05.639 --> 43:09.587
Exactly. She lived for years locked
up in an apartment on her own.

43:10.807 --> 43:15.098
Recently, she gave him the keys
to her house and ever since,

43:15.266 --> 43:17.422
he's been in a state of...

43:19.016 --> 43:20.389
permanent anxiety.

43:23.183 --> 43:26.679
What did I tell you? Now he'll
be constantly worried about her.

43:27.017 --> 43:28.095
He'll be thinking,

43:28.267 --> 43:32.131
"What does she need, shampoo,
medicine, tights... yoghurt?"

43:32.475 --> 43:34.017
it's beautiful, isn't it?

43:34.891 --> 43:36.384
I'm not so sure.

43:36.724 --> 43:38.513
Tell your friend to stay calm,

43:38.683 --> 43:41.515
'cause time is already
working on their gearboxes.

43:50.557 --> 43:52.679
And there you are, Mr. Oldman.

43:57.143 --> 43:59.928
- Are you angry with me?
- Why should I be?

44:00.102 --> 44:02.672
- What I said about your hair.
- Not at all.

44:03.729 --> 44:05.054
I was just calling to ask

44:05.228 --> 44:09.385
if you wish the sale of the furniture
to be identified by your family name.

44:09.559 --> 44:11.431
Or do you prefer anonymity?

44:11.601 --> 44:14.138
- Anonymity, anonymity.
- Good.

44:15.270 --> 44:17.094
This time, I did see you.

44:17.270 --> 44:18.762
- Oh?
- On TV.

44:18.937 --> 44:21.934
I don't generally give
interviews but I was forced to.

44:22.103 --> 44:23.928
You're more intriguing this way.

44:24.103 --> 44:26.769
You'll be a great success
with the ladies.

44:27.102 --> 44:29.139
So, we go to Lot 132.

44:29.310 --> 44:31.847
Gustave Rett, Portrait
of a Woman With a Hat.

44:32.187 --> 44:37.258
1956. Oil on canvas.
80 x 100 cm.

44:37.435 --> 44:39.806
This one goes to the best offer.

44:40.144 --> 44:41.767
£10,000.

44:51.603 --> 44:55.051
Fred, any news from Miss lbbetson?
She hasn't answered in days.

44:55.229 --> 44:57.468
It's a while since
I heard from her.

44:57.645 --> 44:59.469
I've been in bed all week, ill.

44:59.812 --> 45:01.599
Who's been bringing her food?

45:09.687 --> 45:10.966
Miss lbbetson?

45:17.689 --> 45:19.228
Miss lbbetson?

45:29.647 --> 45:31.684
Miss lbbetson? Answer me!

45:35.270 --> 45:37.474
Claire?

45:39.188 --> 45:40.562
Claire, are you alright?

45:42.062 --> 45:43.852
Oh, no. Please!

45:44.022 --> 45:45.977
- No. It's me, Claire.
- Get out!

45:46.147 --> 45:48.018
- It's me, Mr. Oldman.
- Go away!

45:48.188 --> 45:50.474
- Listen to me, it's Mr. Oldman.
- Get out!

45:50.648 --> 45:53.183
There's nobody else here.
Calm down.

45:53.355 --> 45:55.393
What's wrong? Tell
me what happened.

45:56.648 --> 45:58.139
I wasn't well.

45:58.314 --> 46:00.351
I didn't know who to call.

46:00.522 --> 46:01.684
Nobody answered.

46:01.856 --> 46:04.178
And then I fell.

46:04.354 --> 46:07.306
I fell and I hit my...

46:07.647 --> 46:09.353
Open the door.

46:09.689 --> 46:11.231
You need to see a doctor.

46:11.565 --> 46:14.232
No, please! Please!

46:14.565 --> 46:16.888
Please, no!

46:19.981 --> 46:22.184
Can you fix a broken
auctioneer as well?

46:22.522 --> 46:24.311
I wouldn't know where to begin.

46:24.648 --> 46:26.970
It's good to see you
again, Mr. Oldman.

46:27.148 --> 46:30.765
Is something wrong? You seem
more preoccupied than usual.

46:30.941 --> 46:32.896
Too many woodworms
and spider webs

46:33.065 --> 46:35.304
and too few masterpieces.

46:35.480 --> 46:37.022
Could we put it that way?

46:38.315 --> 46:40.886
- So, how's our toy coming along?
- Ah.

46:41.066 --> 46:44.146
Well, I've managed to put
some sections back together.

46:46.024 --> 46:49.722
But, I mean, there's just still
too many pieces missing.

46:50.859 --> 46:52.646
The entire exterior.

46:52.983 --> 46:55.814
We can't establish what
kind of character he is.

46:56.148 --> 46:58.638
Like my friend and his
girl in the tower.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.851
Yeah, maybe, although we've
never seen our android.

47:02.024 --> 47:04.179
We're still groping
around in the dark.

47:04.524 --> 47:05.899
So is he.

47:06.315 --> 47:08.556
He speaks to her
through a closed door.

47:08.900 --> 47:10.973
- Closed door?
- Yes.

47:11.149 --> 47:15.225
If anybody moves in the house, she
barricades herself in her room.

47:15.566 --> 47:19.726
- He's never seen her face?
- Not only him, no-one has.

47:19.900 --> 47:22.899
That's like when two young
people meet on the Internet.

47:23.235 --> 47:26.350
They get to know each other,
then reveal themselves.

47:26.526 --> 47:28.231
She won't reveal herself.

47:28.568 --> 47:31.267
Maybe he hasn't got
a good strategy.

47:32.734 --> 47:36.313
So, it's more difficult for my
friend to succeed in his enterprise

47:36.484 --> 47:39.435
than for us to reconstruct
the Vaucanson automaton?

47:39.610 --> 47:43.438
Depends on the number of Rusty
pieces you're able to bring me.

47:43.776 --> 47:45.149
Well...

47:46.359 --> 47:47.899
here's one more.

47:49.900 --> 47:51.394
That's a mobile phone.

47:52.694 --> 47:53.724
This is brand new.

47:53.902 --> 47:57.183
I'm the one that's Rusty because
I don't know how to use it.

47:57.527 --> 48:00.477
Could you teach me before
your girlfriend gets here?

48:19.569 --> 48:22.058
- Hello.
- Good evening, Mr. Oldman.

48:22.236 --> 48:24.607
It's Claire Ibbetson.
Am I disturbing you?

48:24.778 --> 48:26.733
No, not at all, Miss lbbetson.

48:26.902 --> 48:30.397
I told you, from now on, you
can call me any time you like.

48:30.568 --> 48:32.109
I wanted to thank you for...

48:33.236 --> 48:34.813
everything, really.

48:34.986 --> 48:38.397
No need. All that's important
is you're feeling better now.

48:38.569 --> 48:41.569
Yes, it was just a small cut
on the head. I'm much better.

48:41.739 --> 48:44.522
I wanted to tell you, I
looked over the inventory.

48:44.862 --> 48:47.100
Oh! What do you think?

48:48.361 --> 48:50.684
You've done a great job.
Really, you have.

48:51.904 --> 48:54.060
But I'm troubled
by so many doubts.

48:54.237 --> 48:57.934
I'm not sure if it's a good idea
to sell. What would you advise?

48:58.113 --> 49:00.897
I couldn't say. I don't
know what your plans are.

49:01.237 --> 49:03.808
Why did you decide to
sell in the first place?

49:03.987 --> 49:07.851
Out of necessity in order to start
life afresh or another reason?

49:08.195 --> 49:10.150
All of the above, I suppose.

49:10.320 --> 49:13.354
I'd even sell the house.
It's too big for me now.

49:13.530 --> 49:17.191
Sometimes, I feel as though
I were in a public square.

49:17.363 --> 49:19.399
I'd like something smaller.

49:19.571 --> 49:21.479
But the idea of
having to leave here

49:21.653 --> 49:23.940
and go somewhere else
fills me with dread.

49:24.113 --> 49:25.736
How would I manage it?

49:25.905 --> 49:29.186
Wear blindfolds? Have myself
carried out while asleep?

49:29.364 --> 49:32.694
I'd get into a state and end
up putting everything off.

49:35.781 --> 49:38.730
You have all the time in the
world to make up your mind.

49:39.029 --> 49:41.981
- You think?
- Well, until the catalogue is printed.

49:42.321 --> 49:46.267
Don't torment yourself. Think
of yourself, your future.

49:46.447 --> 49:48.522
That's the biggest
torment of all.

49:48.863 --> 49:51.020
When I think about it,
I can't even work.

49:51.197 --> 49:53.603
I didn't know you were working.

49:53.781 --> 49:58.105
I write. I write novels,
stories, things like that.

49:58.449 --> 50:00.567
I'd like to read them.
I'll buy some.

50:00.904 --> 50:03.309
Luckily for us, you'll
never manage to.

50:03.655 --> 50:05.030
Why not?

50:05.197 --> 50:08.944
Because I write under a pseudonym
and I loathe what I write.

50:09.282 --> 50:12.279
Artists always loathe what
they make, Miss lbbetson.

50:12.449 --> 50:14.403
Yesterday, you called me Claire.

50:16.447 --> 50:19.400
I wasn't aware. I was
in a state of alarm.

50:19.574 --> 50:21.943
- Sorry.
- I'd like you to continue.

50:23.407 --> 50:27.403
"I'd like you to continue." She
said it to him, just like that.

50:27.575 --> 50:29.113
Well, what did he say?

50:29.282 --> 50:32.278
He was taken back but he went
along with what she wanted.

50:32.615 --> 50:34.073
What else could he do?

50:34.405 --> 50:37.488
I'd have asked her to do the
same, call me by my first name.

50:37.658 --> 50:39.150
That's not his style.

50:39.324 --> 50:42.275
Besides, I don't think my
friend intends to court her.

50:42.450 --> 50:44.854
Then he'll never get
her out of there.

50:45.031 --> 50:48.195
I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

50:48.367 --> 50:51.280
I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

50:51.450 --> 50:52.646
Horrible voice!

50:52.990 --> 50:56.238
I'd have thought he'd at least
have desired to see her face.

50:56.408 --> 50:59.240
'Desired's probably
not the right word.

50:59.409 --> 51:03.318
Curious to see her, perhaps.
Yes, I could understand that.

51:03.491 --> 51:06.573
But the chances of it happening
seem to be really remote.

51:06.742 --> 51:08.069
There might be a way.

51:08.410 --> 51:10.732
Just depends on how
brave your friend is.

51:12.033 --> 51:14.521
- The French bureau.
- Yes.

51:14.700 --> 51:18.564
- The table with the roll top.
- No, I'd like to keep that.

51:18.908 --> 51:21.658
That's it. Next time,
we'll do the paintings.

51:21.992 --> 51:23.899
- Ok.
- One last thing, Claire.

51:24.076 --> 51:27.939
You'll have to decide whether we do
the photography here or in a studio.

51:28.283 --> 51:31.235
In a studio. I don't want
many people around the house.

51:31.576 --> 51:34.242
That's the best solution.
Well, I'm off now.

51:34.409 --> 51:37.324
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Mr. Oldman.

51:38.659 --> 51:40.532
When will we next
see each other?

51:41.869 --> 51:46.526
You mean, when do you see me? Since
I am not given that privilege.

51:47.827 --> 51:49.947
- Forgive me.
- But soon.

51:51.035 --> 51:53.190
- Have a good day.
- You too.

53:29.788 --> 53:30.865
Hello?

53:56.249 --> 53:59.364
- I can't believe it.
- I couldn't sleep at night, Virgil.

53:59.539 --> 54:02.620
I had to do something
to make you forgive me.

54:02.789 --> 54:04.532
But how did you get it?

54:04.875 --> 54:07.954
I heard that Mrs. Durane
had fallen on hard times,

54:08.123 --> 54:12.828
so I persuaded her to sell
it to me for £250,000.

54:12.997 --> 54:15.204
Hmm, not exactly cheap!

54:15.374 --> 54:17.365
I thought it was a
reasonable price.

54:17.707 --> 54:19.696
You were talking
about £8 million.

54:19.873 --> 54:22.112
This way, everyone
gets a good deal.

54:23.583 --> 54:25.370
How much do you want, Billy?

54:25.539 --> 54:28.158
I don't want a Penny more
than I gave the old girl.

54:28.332 --> 54:30.369
Now you're really
losing your grip.

54:30.708 --> 54:32.864
I just want to get
back to where we were.

54:33.210 --> 54:35.957
How was your friend,
your accomplice,

54:36.291 --> 54:38.329
your trusted procurer of women?

54:39.915 --> 54:43.695
If you're doing this to win back my
trust, it's been a bad deal for you.

54:45.375 --> 54:47.413
You never lost it
in the first place.

54:47.752 --> 54:49.657
Oh!

54:51.168 --> 54:54.247
This is great. This is great!

54:54.584 --> 54:56.325
You found important stuff.

54:56.499 --> 54:58.371
Best bit is this.

55:00.665 --> 55:03.535
- An ear.
- A step forward, wouldn't you say?

55:03.875 --> 55:06.330
I'd say! I'd say we're
at a turning point.

55:06.501 --> 55:07.744
Look.

55:13.875 --> 55:15.582
- Huh?
- Excellent.

55:15.916 --> 55:18.406
The pieces are
attracting each other.

55:18.585 --> 55:19.615
So...

55:20.960 --> 55:24.207
How did things go with your...
friend?

55:26.543 --> 55:30.535
How many seconds did it take you to
realize I was talking about myself?

55:30.708 --> 55:32.534
Quite a few, to be honest.

55:32.708 --> 55:35.328
Let me confess, I didn't
follow your advice.

55:36.418 --> 55:40.459
There was something too contorted
about it, too imprudent.

55:40.626 --> 55:42.203
Yeah, Ok, I see your point.

56:03.293 --> 56:07.370
The mathematical set
of a six-day week.

56:08.628 --> 56:13.617
The mathematical set
of a 51-minute hour.

56:15.003 --> 56:17.788
- What will you have, Sir?
- Tea, please.

56:18.129 --> 56:20.085
Have you thought
of anything else?

56:20.255 --> 56:22.872
The length of a point. The
direction of a circle.

56:23.045 --> 56:25.284
Your tea's ready, Sir.

56:25.461 --> 56:29.207
The edge of a circumference.
The Centre of space.

56:31.338 --> 56:35.662
- The area of a segment.
- Amazing. Well done!

56:36.796 --> 56:39.414
The vertical position
of a sphere.

56:41.338 --> 56:44.087
I brought the furniture
and painting valuations.

56:44.254 --> 56:47.666
Look at them carefully because
you'll have to authorize them.

56:47.837 --> 56:51.784
- I don't know a thing about this.
- I know. Trust me, Miss lbbetson.

56:51.964 --> 56:54.793
You've been spending time
in the cellars recently.

56:54.962 --> 56:58.624
- Is that why you changed the locks?
- I change them every six months.

57:01.589 --> 57:04.372
And I take care to double-check,
compare and correct

57:04.712 --> 57:07.498
when dealing with odds
and ends in cellars.

57:07.671 --> 57:10.124
It's how I work. If it
upsets you, speak now.

57:10.505 --> 57:14.166
You'll find the new keys on
the table. Please take them.

57:18.589 --> 57:20.710
Thank you for your trust.

57:20.881 --> 57:23.037
Were you offended at
being locked out?

57:23.214 --> 57:24.409
No, but I was worried.

57:25.754 --> 57:28.836
You're right, I should
have told you. I'm sorry.

57:30.963 --> 57:34.543
Claire, you're ruining your life
for reasons which are beyond me.

57:34.881 --> 57:38.461
This illness of yours is so
absurd, it almost seems unreal.

57:40.131 --> 57:42.749
My mother thought I was
faking it the first time.

57:42.922 --> 57:44.297
We were abroad.

57:44.465 --> 57:47.462
I was so afraid of walking at
the foot of the Eiffel Tower

57:47.632 --> 57:49.040
that it paralyzed me.

57:49.214 --> 57:52.168
I started screaming,
fell to the ground.

57:52.341 --> 57:55.540
I was just a little girl, but
it kept happening more and more

57:55.715 --> 57:57.255
and she had to believe me.

57:57.423 --> 57:59.213
Has there ever
been an open space

57:59.381 --> 58:01.750
where you weren't
overcome by anxiety?

58:01.923 --> 58:06.664
Only one. During a school
trip to Prague. I was 14.

58:06.840 --> 58:09.127
The square with the
astronomical clock.

58:09.299 --> 58:13.293
I must have walked across it a
hundred times. It was beautiful.

58:13.633 --> 58:16.747
I remember a restaurant
with very strange decor.

58:17.966 --> 58:21.413
If there's one place in the world
I'm nostalgic for, it's that.

58:21.591 --> 58:23.048
I was really happy there.

58:24.466 --> 58:26.870
It was called Night and Day.

58:28.342 --> 58:31.292
- You've never been back?
- Never.

58:32.716 --> 58:36.496
Why not go now? I'd
be happy to take you.

58:41.634 --> 58:45.627
Well, you don't seem too
pleased. We're almost there.

58:46.841 --> 58:50.043
Our automaton is about to
emerge from the shadows.

58:50.218 --> 58:52.622
No, I'm delighted. You're
a force of nature.

58:54.926 --> 58:56.169
It's just that...

58:57.341 --> 58:59.131
this is one of those evenings

58:59.301 --> 59:01.836
when one feels like this
contraption here...

59:07.884 --> 59:09.045
incomplete.

59:10.300 --> 59:13.297
Why did you never marry?
You know, never have kids?

59:13.592 --> 59:15.086
The regard I have for women

59:15.261 --> 59:18.257
is equal to the fear I've
always had of them...

59:18.426 --> 59:20.916
and to my failure
to understand them.

59:22.051 --> 59:24.256
If that's the rule,
then Miss lbbetson

59:24.426 --> 59:27.875
gives every impression
of being the exception.

59:28.052 --> 59:29.212
I'm afraid so.

59:29.385 --> 59:32.088
Have you really never
set eyes on her?

59:32.259 --> 59:33.422
Just once.

59:34.469 --> 59:35.843
What's she like?

59:36.010 --> 59:39.671
I suppose feeling a certain
interest in a person

59:39.842 --> 59:43.423
necessarily engenders a
conviction that she's beautiful.

59:43.594 --> 59:45.252
Up to a point.

59:47.012 --> 59:50.672
It's her birthday in two days. I'd
like to get her something useful.

59:52.135 --> 59:55.088
I don't think useful is
probably your best approach.

59:55.426 --> 59:56.885
- No?
- Not the first time.

59:57.052 --> 01:00:00.050
It's better to get her
something more... traditional.

01:00:05.138 --> 01:00:06.333
Morning, Sir.

01:00:08.762 --> 01:00:10.585
Hello, Sir.

01:00:10.928 --> 01:00:13.795
Hey, Mr. Oldman. Look what
I found in the cellar.

01:00:15.053 --> 01:00:17.340
I saw you were interested
in this old junk.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.841
The supports for the
Murano chandelier.

01:00:21.179 --> 01:00:23.133
My colleagues
couldn't find them.

01:00:23.304 --> 01:00:26.503
- I can put them in your car.
- That's very kind.

01:00:28.263 --> 01:00:29.505
Wait.

01:00:31.262 --> 01:00:32.423
Oh, thanks.

01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:35.917
Morning, Mr. Oldman.

01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:40.919
I took the liberty of
remembering it's your birthday.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:42.798
Happy Birthday, Claire.

01:00:45.512 --> 01:00:48.511
I read the valuation
documents.

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:50.919
Did you manage to
understand some of it?

01:00:51.094 --> 01:00:53.133
Of course. Ridiculous
sums of money.

01:00:53.304 --> 01:00:56.303
Even a backwards child would
know she's being cheated.

01:00:56.472 --> 01:00:59.304
They need interpretation.
They're starting bids.

01:00:59.472 --> 01:01:02.553
- There'll be higher bids later.
- Suppose there aren't!

01:01:02.721 --> 01:01:05.470
Unlikely, but in that case,
we'll even things out.

01:01:05.637 --> 01:01:07.961
We'll raise the margins
on other pieces.

01:01:08.137 --> 01:01:10.757
A gamble? Where I'm the
only one that can lose?

01:01:10.931 --> 01:01:14.011
You're trying to cheat me.
It's all to your advantage.

01:01:14.181 --> 01:01:15.805
You're a fucking thief!

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:19.721
I'm willing to resign the
commission forthwith.

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:21.959
Huh!

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:27.550
I'll have them replace all your
mediocre bric-a-brac immediately.

01:01:27.723 --> 01:01:30.343
And do me the favor of
disappearing completely

01:01:30.516 --> 01:01:31.974
from the face of the earth!

01:02:16.557 --> 01:02:18.099
1984, Sir.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.097
- Hello.
- I behaved so badly.

01:02:42.184 --> 01:02:46.473
I feel so stupid. I constantly
have to offer justifications.

01:02:48.934 --> 01:02:51.471
I've never been given
flowers before.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:56.547
I don't know what
this says to me.

01:02:58.351 --> 01:03:02.012
There's no need for this display of
anguish. I'm not angry with you.

01:03:05.976 --> 01:03:08.464
My birthdays have always
been so horrible.

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:13.641
And you... Since
you came along...

01:03:14.852 --> 01:03:17.720
you've turned my
life upside down.

01:03:20.434 --> 01:03:23.184
The other day, I
went downstairs.

01:03:24.436 --> 01:03:28.429
I opened the main door and
looked out onto the garden.

01:03:30.103 --> 01:03:32.556
- Did you go out?
- No.

01:03:34.435 --> 01:03:36.225
I was afraid.

01:03:36.392 --> 01:03:37.933
I felt terrible.

01:03:39.769 --> 01:03:41.890
But I never even got
that far before.

01:03:45.937 --> 01:03:47.476
Do you want me to come over?

01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:51.016
I already know it's pointless.

01:03:51.184 --> 01:03:54.266
There are new treatments
nowadays. They might help you.

01:03:54.435 --> 01:03:56.723
I'd rather talk to you
than to some shrink.

01:03:58.186 --> 01:04:01.101
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Yes.

01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:07.340
I see you brought up the
portrait of the dancer.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.267
- It's something I want to keep.
- No great value.

01:04:10.435 --> 01:04:13.387
It's a portrait of my mother.

01:04:13.563 --> 01:04:15.767
She was about my age
when she had it done.

01:04:19.895 --> 01:04:21.304
Do you look like her?

01:04:21.479 --> 01:04:24.975
- She was prettier, I can assure you.
- I cannot judge.

01:04:34.521 --> 01:04:36.014
Alright, Claire. I'll go.

01:04:36.188 --> 01:04:39.387
Don't hesitate to call if
you need anything at all.

01:04:39.562 --> 01:04:41.638
Thank you, Mr. Oldman.
See you soon, I hope.

01:05:29.607 --> 01:05:32.519
Hello? Oh, it's you, director.

01:05:32.898 --> 01:05:35.387
No, I would've called
you, it's just that...

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:38.398
clearing the furniture
has been complicated.

01:05:39.858 --> 01:05:42.227
Yes. Oldman is dealing with it.

01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:46.886
What's he like? Not as
old as you might think.

01:05:47.273 --> 01:05:51.017
He dresses in an odd way, but
he's still a good-looking man.

01:05:51.398 --> 01:05:53.354
I know I can trust him.

01:05:53.525 --> 01:05:56.856
Why? Are you jealous?

01:05:57.483 --> 01:06:00.315
In love? No, I don't think so.

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:03.271
He's too put off by my
illness, like everybody.

01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:07.845
Oh no, it's nothing. I...
I hurt my foot.

01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:09.849
Can we talk later?

01:06:35.485 --> 01:06:36.728
Who is it?

01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:39.149
Who's there?

01:06:40.151 --> 01:06:42.685
No, get out! No,
please, get out!

01:06:43.108 --> 01:06:45.394
Go away! Get out!

01:06:45.776 --> 01:06:48.774
Get out! Please, leave me alone!

01:06:50.652 --> 01:06:52.192
Get out!

01:06:54.859 --> 01:06:56.398
Get out!

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:15.513
- Hello?
- Please, help me, please.

01:07:15.775 --> 01:07:18.347
Calm down, Claire.
What's happened?

01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:21.312
You have to help me! Help me!

01:07:21.569 --> 01:07:24.484
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Please.

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:21.612
Claire!

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:25.769
- It's me. I'm here. What's happened?
- There's somebody in the house!

01:08:25.988 --> 01:08:29.020
- Please get them out!
- Calm down. There's nobody here.

01:08:29.194 --> 01:08:31.566
- There's someone in the house!
- Calm down.

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:34.938
It was me before, Claire.
It was me.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.069
It was me.

01:08:40.823 --> 01:08:43.392
I hid in the room
so I could see you.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.362
You were spying on me?

01:08:48.488 --> 01:08:50.563
You were spying on me?

01:08:51.154 --> 01:08:52.613
Get out!

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:55.897
I want nothing more to
do with you! Get out!

01:09:06.102 --> 01:09:08.590
Please, Virgil. Don't go.

01:09:26.354 --> 01:09:29.469
Believe me, I don't normally
behave like this...

01:09:31.062 --> 01:09:32.602
Neither do I.

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:36.720
So I'm bound to make
some mistakes...

01:09:39.187 --> 01:09:42.716
but nothing in the world would
make me want to hurt you.

01:09:43.894 --> 01:09:47.176
It's just that I
can't help myself.

01:09:49.395 --> 01:09:51.268
I need to see you.

01:10:27.815 --> 01:10:29.639
You should've seen her.

01:10:31.022 --> 01:10:33.806
Pale, like a Durer etching.

01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:37.687
She had the look of some creature
terrified of the universe.

01:10:38.023 --> 01:10:40.771
And I could read my own
terror in her eyes.

01:10:41.106 --> 01:10:45.645
Every man on earth would like to be
as terrified as you at this moment.

01:10:53.775 --> 01:10:56.557
- You've worked a miracle.
- It's too soon to tell.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:00.602
And you be careful, alright?
This is when mistakes occur.

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.895
When you think you've made it,

01:11:03.273 --> 01:11:05.063
that is when you lose strategy.

01:11:05.399 --> 01:11:09.346
- And what strategy would that be?
- Never stop surprising them.

01:11:09.524 --> 01:11:14.145
Do things they couldn't have
foreseen. Take a gamble, run a risk.

01:11:14.482 --> 01:11:17.315
You're asking me to behave
in a way that isn't me.

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:19.724
That's why you have to do it.

01:11:20.524 --> 01:11:23.273
As long as you're playing
according to her rules,

01:11:23.441 --> 01:11:26.642
you're always gonna make her
feel like... like a patient.

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.222
She needs to be
treated like a woman.

01:11:59.984 --> 01:12:02.058
What do you think?
Do you like it?

01:12:05.901 --> 01:12:07.442
I don't know.

01:12:08.734 --> 01:12:10.276
What do you think?

01:12:11.276 --> 01:12:13.267
It looks marvelous
on you, Claire.

01:12:14.024 --> 01:12:15.648
Perhaps the smaller size?

01:12:16.527 --> 01:12:19.146
Yes. I think so too.

01:12:32.859 --> 01:12:35.693
It's been a long time since
I got a present like this.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.731
- Long overdue, don't you think?
- I don't know.

01:12:41.109 --> 01:12:43.859
I'm a little, you
know, taken a back.

01:12:50.903 --> 01:12:52.941
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- What?

01:12:54.859 --> 01:12:56.056
Oh, certainly.

01:12:56.943 --> 01:12:59.859
I'm sorry. I
didn't understand.

01:13:08.445 --> 01:13:11.527
I don't honestly know
if I deserve all this.

01:13:14.861 --> 01:13:17.316
Let me be the judge of that.

01:13:35.821 --> 01:13:38.488
If we don't set a date for
the Stockholm auction,

01:13:38.654 --> 01:13:40.148
they'll shoot themselves.

01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:42.808
It's too far. Let them
shoot themselves.

01:13:45.572 --> 01:13:48.734
We have to schedule the
meeting with the Hermitage

01:13:49.071 --> 01:13:51.820
and the auctions in San
Francisco and Madrid.

01:13:51.987 --> 01:13:53.446
Ditto. Too far away.

01:13:53.738 --> 01:13:57.270
- We can't abandon them.
- There are auctioneers galore.

01:13:57.447 --> 01:14:00.361
They'll find someone else
and it will cost them less.

01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:01.808
As you wish.

01:14:07.199 --> 01:14:09.318
Lambert, are you married?

01:14:10.238 --> 01:14:12.692
Yes. Nearly 30 years.

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:15.566
What's it like,
living with a woman?

01:14:15.948 --> 01:14:17.820
Like taking part in an auction.

01:14:18.488 --> 01:14:21.652
You never know if yours
will be the best offer.

01:14:48.449 --> 01:14:50.025
- This one.
- Very well, Sir.

01:14:51.782 --> 01:14:54.697
What do you think? Have
I made myself pretty?

01:14:56.489 --> 01:14:58.977
- Beautiful. You've done very well.
- Liar.

01:14:59.156 --> 01:15:01.526
- Claire.
- I haven't done this for years.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:04.864
I've forgotten how to do it.
I look like a monster.

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:07.946
Trust me. Some practice
and you'll be wonderful.

01:15:08.116 --> 01:15:10.569
And you'll take me to
one of your auctions,

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.648
and to galas with
elegant people,

01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:16.438
and to the most refined
restaurants in the world.

01:15:16.783 --> 01:15:20.777
That's the reason for your
presents, isn't it, Virgil?

01:15:21.741 --> 01:15:24.988
To help me recover little by
little, and then take me out.

01:15:25.325 --> 01:15:27.114
Isn't that right?

01:15:29.534 --> 01:15:30.990
No!

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.398
Claire. Don't be like this.
Let's talk.

01:15:37.657 --> 01:15:41.900
Maybe we did get the last moves
wrong. I was a bit rash.

01:15:42.283 --> 01:15:43.776
Don't blame yourself.

01:15:43.951 --> 01:15:47.317
It's always her who manages
to pull everything apart.

01:15:47.658 --> 01:15:49.863
Robert. My aunt's
gone missing again.

01:15:50.035 --> 01:15:51.739
- You're kidding.
- Pardon me.

01:15:52.076 --> 01:15:55.192
- We found her in Central Park.
- I'm sorry, Terry.

01:15:55.367 --> 01:15:58.282
It was no good trying
to reset this thing.

01:15:58.451 --> 01:16:01.781
It was much more easy
just to make a new one.

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:04.487
This one has a much wider range.

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:07.149
She can go off and you
won't lose touch.

01:16:07.493 --> 01:16:10.030
Just make sure you
reprogram the PC, okay?

01:16:10.202 --> 01:16:12.357
I can manage that.
You're an Angel.

01:16:13.285 --> 01:16:15.075
- Thanks, darling.
- No worries.

01:16:15.953 --> 01:16:18.784
- I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:20.953 --> 01:16:26.154
You need an idea that'll excite her
but at the same time reassure her.

01:16:26.368 --> 01:16:30.943
Yes, but she'll still see through
it as some deceitful therapy.

01:16:31.244 --> 01:16:34.609
- You should invite her to dinner.
- Yes! Noma in Copenhagen!

01:16:34.954 --> 01:16:37.487
At the climax of the
evening, by candlelight,

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:40.114
tell her that she's beautiful.

01:16:40.452 --> 01:16:42.572
And after you'll
have coffee with us?

01:16:42.911 --> 01:16:44.452
Why not?

01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:50.743
Joking apart, I'd be glad if you
did see her, hear her talk.

01:16:51.121 --> 01:16:53.951
I'm sure you'd understand
far more than I.

01:16:55.743 --> 01:16:57.782
Who said anything about joking?

01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:03.537
129,403.

01:17:03.704 --> 01:17:05.410
Your champagne.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.075
- Thank you.
- Calculate this.

01:17:08.994 --> 01:17:14.992
12,624,831.333.

01:17:17.413 --> 01:17:18.955
Unbelievable!

01:17:24.494 --> 01:17:26.070
You're radiant, Claire.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.530
You did all this?

01:17:29.704 --> 01:17:32.406
I can turn my hand to
interior decorating.

01:17:41.369 --> 01:17:44.866
You've done a wonderful
job, Virgil. Thank you.

01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:54.403
I can't tell you how long I've
wanted to spend time alone with you.

01:17:54.747 --> 01:17:58.243
Somewhere quiet, far
from the madding crowd.

01:18:03.663 --> 01:18:05.736
To your serenity, Claire.

01:18:08.331 --> 01:18:10.037
To your irony, Virgil.

01:18:16.081 --> 01:18:18.450
- Now I feel I can finally tell you.
- What?

01:18:18.789 --> 01:18:21.323
You are more beautiful
than the dancer.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.533
Dinner is served.

01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:28.404
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

01:18:28.747 --> 01:18:31.118
I warn you, as a waiter
I'm not the best.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.828
I offer no guarantees.

01:18:34.541 --> 01:18:37.656
- I'll take the risk.
- Somewhat foolhardy of you.

01:18:38.289 --> 01:18:41.324
- Why?
- If the service is not to your liking,

01:18:41.498 --> 01:18:43.655
next time I'd have to
make a reservation

01:18:43.834 --> 01:18:45.456
at the best restaurant in town.

01:18:48.124 --> 01:18:50.244
Let's not ruin this
evening, Virgil.

01:18:50.415 --> 01:18:53.864
- Please, let's not talk about me.
- Alright.

01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:56.874
Instead I'd like you to
tell me about your past.

01:18:57.249 --> 01:19:00.448
You see, there's nothing
very original about my life.

01:19:00.792 --> 01:19:03.909
A child loses his parents,
a horrible orphanage...

01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:07.661
The only point of interest is that
the nuns would punish the boy

01:19:07.832 --> 01:19:11.245
by making him work with a restorer
who had a workshop there.

01:19:11.582 --> 01:19:13.326
That's beautiful.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.705
He loved to observe
this craftsman,

01:19:16.042 --> 01:19:19.702
so the little boy got up
to all sorts of mischief

01:19:19.874 --> 01:19:22.790
to ensure he'd be punished
as often as possible.

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:24.785
So he became
acquainted with art,

01:19:25.124 --> 01:19:28.905
techniques of painting, how to
tell a forgery from an original

01:19:29.084 --> 01:19:30.874
etc., etc.

01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:36.032
In an old article of yours I
found on the Internet, you said,

01:19:36.374 --> 01:19:39.622
"There's something authentic
in every forgery."

01:19:39.959 --> 01:19:41.368
What did you mean?

01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:43.616
When simulating another's work

01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:47.913
the forger can't resist the temptation
to put in something of himself.

01:19:48.086 --> 01:19:51.199
Often it's just a trifle,
a detail of no interest.

01:19:51.541 --> 01:19:53.119
One unsuspected stroke,

01:19:53.293 --> 01:19:56.540
by which the forger inevitably
ends up betraying himself,

01:19:56.876 --> 01:20:00.159
and revealing his own, utterly
authentic sensibilities.

01:20:01.126 --> 01:20:03.367
I really love the way you talk.

01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:06.080
You couldn't have
been more convincing.

01:20:06.251 --> 01:20:08.043
Huh? A born seducer.

01:20:08.376 --> 01:20:12.417
- So you'd give me a pass?
- A+. With distinction!

01:20:12.751 --> 01:20:15.370
Sorry, you've been a
bit neglected lately.

01:20:17.169 --> 01:20:19.787
You haven't said
anything about Claire.

01:20:20.586 --> 01:20:24.247
If I didn't know about her
problems, I'd say she was normal.

01:20:24.627 --> 01:20:27.959
And she's much more beautiful
than you described.

01:20:28.294 --> 01:20:30.747
Really. I liked her.

01:20:30.918 --> 01:20:32.875
You're going to make me jealous?

01:20:33.044 --> 01:20:36.292
If you want my advice, you pray
that girl never gets better.

01:20:36.627 --> 01:20:39.199
Do you want lots 87 and
88 done separately?

01:20:39.378 --> 01:20:41.749
No, together. That's important.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.118
How can I help you?

01:20:51.836 --> 01:20:54.242
- It's about Robert.
- What's going on?

01:20:56.253 --> 01:20:57.627
Don't be afraid to tell me.

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:02.587
We're not getting on so
well, that's the problem.

01:21:02.919 --> 01:21:05.288
All those girls
hovering around him...

01:21:06.543 --> 01:21:08.086
I guess I'm just...

01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:10.294
I'm afraid of losing him.

01:21:11.378 --> 01:21:13.250
Is there anything I can do?

01:21:14.588 --> 01:21:16.129
Do you want me to talk to him?

01:21:18.254 --> 01:21:22.377
For a while now he's been talking
about someone called Claire.

01:21:24.837 --> 01:21:26.379
Claire?

01:21:27.338 --> 01:21:29.210
I don't understand.

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:33.788
With him everybody's got to be
on their guard, all the time.

01:21:34.128 --> 01:21:35.871
That goes for you, too.

01:21:38.798 --> 01:21:40.670
I feel so stupid.

01:21:43.964 --> 01:21:46.333
Promise me you won't
say a word to him.

01:21:47.421 --> 01:21:49.080
I promise.

01:21:54.214 --> 01:21:56.785
Have you been waiting long?

01:21:56.965 --> 01:21:59.715
If you'd phoned, I wouldn't
have kept you waiting.

01:21:59.882 --> 01:22:02.547
- I prefer to see you.
- Is something wrong?

01:22:02.881 --> 01:22:04.788
My assistant will come by today.

01:22:04.964 --> 01:22:07.962
Kindly hand over the
Vaucanson as it is.

01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:10.204
Alright. Whatever you want.

01:22:10.548 --> 01:22:13.038
Tell him how much you're owed.
He'll pay you.

01:22:15.048 --> 01:22:17.086
Aren't I at least
due an explanation?

01:22:17.256 --> 01:22:20.206
You're not the trustworthy
man I thought you were.

01:22:22.215 --> 01:22:25.580
It's weird seeing them so
perfect and polished up.

01:22:25.923 --> 01:22:27.379
It's as if they weren't mine.

01:22:38.591 --> 01:22:40.628
I believe nothing is missing.

01:22:41.798 --> 01:22:43.422
There is something missing.

01:23:03.966 --> 01:23:08.125
How could you have lived the
best years of your life in here?

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:12.001
I don't know. I don't know.

01:23:12.718 --> 01:23:14.257
It was just the right thing.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.291
"Was."

01:23:21.092 --> 01:23:22.634
it still is.

01:23:22.968 --> 01:23:24.508
It always will be.

01:23:25.259 --> 01:23:26.800
Always.

01:23:33.843 --> 01:23:37.539
You have to get out of here.
You have to do it by yourself.

01:23:38.551 --> 01:23:40.423
I don't have the courage.

01:23:42.594 --> 01:23:45.840
It's a spider's web that I don't
know how to break free of.

01:23:50.301 --> 01:23:52.706
It's an old collection
my father was fond of.

01:23:53.051 --> 01:23:55.172
I never did understand
what it was.

01:24:02.344 --> 01:24:05.045
Hello? Good morning, director.

01:24:06.135 --> 01:24:08.007
Yes, I'm nearly finished.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.248
But I would like to
rewrite the last chapter.

01:24:11.926 --> 01:24:14.002
A more upbeat ending.

01:24:16.095 --> 01:24:17.966
If that's all you want...

01:24:18.802 --> 01:24:21.718
Yes. Talk to you soon. Thanks.

01:24:24.053 --> 01:24:27.419
I wouldn't rule out them being
part of something valuable,

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:29.633
but exactly what I couldn't say.

01:24:29.968 --> 01:24:32.457
- I often wonder if...
- What?

01:24:32.761 --> 01:24:35.676
If you're more interested
in my furniture than in me.

01:24:37.428 --> 01:24:39.502
How could you say that?

01:24:41.344 --> 01:24:44.259
I shouldn't have let you
in here. I shouldn't have.

01:25:07.804 --> 01:25:10.257
I've found all the
missing pieces.

01:25:10.554 --> 01:25:12.841
How do you feel about
finishing the job?

01:25:13.721 --> 01:25:15.628
Well, it's your problem.

01:25:17.804 --> 01:25:19.843
Sarah came to see
me a few days ago.

01:25:20.013 --> 01:25:22.252
She was upset about
your relationship.

01:25:25.722 --> 01:25:30.128
- Are you here to advise me now?
- No, you're the expert on women.

01:25:31.471 --> 01:25:34.137
Alright. We can pick
up where we left off.

01:25:34.472 --> 01:25:35.633
On two conditions.

01:25:35.973 --> 01:25:39.635
You just stop involving
me in your private life.

01:25:40.889 --> 01:25:41.967
And the second?

01:25:47.805 --> 01:25:49.262
Is that you take this back.

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:58.297
I didn't get excited about
your Vaucanson for the money.

01:26:01.764 --> 01:26:03.672
I brought it back.
It's in the car.

01:26:04.014 --> 01:26:05.838
And the new pieces too?

01:26:06.181 --> 01:26:10.257
You'll have to be patient for those.
They're tied up with my private life.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.430
I don't know and I
don't want to know.

01:26:14.807 --> 01:26:18.931
If you were forced to choose
between Claire and the automaton,

01:26:19.263 --> 01:26:21.173
which would you take?

01:26:28.557 --> 01:26:31.922
- This one.
- An excellent choice, Mr. Oldman.

01:26:32.265 --> 01:26:33.593
If it's the wrong size,

01:26:33.766 --> 01:26:36.883
please inform the lady to
pass by whenever she wishes.

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.763
Thank you, I'll let her know.

01:26:39.099 --> 01:26:40.805
Claire? It's me.

01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:00.882
Claire! I've brought lunch.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:12.058
Claire!

01:27:13.682 --> 01:27:18.507
Claire, answer me!

01:27:20.226 --> 01:27:21.766
Claire!

01:27:23.478 --> 01:27:25.015
Claire!

01:27:26.852 --> 01:27:28.392
Claire!

01:27:34.017 --> 01:27:35.593
Are you down here?

01:27:41.101 --> 01:27:43.804
Claire!

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:21.511
Have any of you seen a woman

01:28:21.686 --> 01:28:24.602
going out the gate of the
villa across the road?

01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:26.228
No, I can't say I have.

01:28:26.561 --> 01:28:29.594
Has anybody seen someone
coming out of the villa?

01:28:29.935 --> 01:28:32.686
A young woman. Medium
height, light hair.

01:28:33.019 --> 01:28:35.509
- A bit pale.
- I think I saw her.

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:37.131
I didn't see her go out,

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:39.517
but she was walking
away from the gate.

01:28:39.855 --> 01:28:42.140
- When?
- This morning at breakfast.

01:28:42.479 --> 01:28:45.643
- What else can you tell me?
- She seemed a bit weird.

01:28:45.979 --> 01:28:50.304
- Weird? Which way did she go?
- That way. Towards the park.

01:28:50.645 --> 01:28:52.388
231.

01:28:52.729 --> 01:28:55.978
Idiot!

01:28:58.145 --> 01:29:00.351
- Hello? Virgil?
- She's gone.

01:29:00.521 --> 01:29:03.140
- Who? What's going on?
- Claire's disappeared.

01:29:03.313 --> 01:29:06.181
I've looked. They saw
her leave this morning.

01:29:06.521 --> 01:29:08.843
- Do you want me to come over?
- Please.

01:29:11.729 --> 01:29:13.271
Has this happened before?

01:29:13.438 --> 01:29:15.594
She never even appeared
at the windows.

01:29:15.771 --> 01:29:17.314
Just behind the shutters.

01:29:17.646 --> 01:29:19.886
Did she have friends
she could go to?

01:29:20.231 --> 01:29:24.519
She'd talk to people on her
computer under different names.

01:29:24.855 --> 01:29:28.434
- She can't have gone far.
- Let's hope so.

01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:30.809
I've already been
round three times.

01:29:33.439 --> 01:29:35.230
- Hello?
- Mr. Oldman.

01:29:35.398 --> 01:29:38.181
- Listen, has Miss lbbetson phoned?
- No.

01:29:38.356 --> 01:29:41.057
- If she calls, let me know.
- I will.

01:29:41.232 --> 01:29:45.010
Mr. Oldman, I wouldn't like
to think you'd forgotten.

01:29:45.187 --> 01:29:47.062
Forgotten what?

01:29:54.482 --> 01:29:57.894
- There he is. Here we go.
- Lot number one.

01:29:58.232 --> 01:30:02.271
Late Baroque, Venetian,
mid-18th-century mirror.

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.561
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,

01:30:04.898 --> 01:30:07.896
with adornments, floral
motifs and festoons.

01:30:10.105 --> 01:30:11.646
Upper frame richly...

01:30:19.898 --> 01:30:22.647
Inlaid wood with gold
leaf, with adornments,

01:30:22.815 --> 01:30:24.558
floral motifs and festoons.

01:30:24.734 --> 01:30:27.102
Upper frame richly
engraved with whirls.

01:30:27.274 --> 01:30:28.732
Can we say 130,000 Euros?

01:30:29.857 --> 01:30:31.434
140,000 Euros.

01:30:31.773 --> 01:30:34.096
150,000 Euros.
Gentleman on my left.

01:30:34.274 --> 01:30:36.313
160,000 Euros. Lady up the back.

01:30:36.692 --> 01:30:40.814
170,000 Euros. 180,000
Euros on the telephone.

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:44.729
200,000 Euros. Gentleman
on my left in the room.

01:30:44.899 --> 01:30:47.104
220,000 Euros.

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:50.392
250,000 Euros on the tele...

01:30:50.733 --> 01:30:53.767
Still nothing, Mr. Oldman.
I'll keep looking.

01:30:53.943 --> 01:30:56.561
- Robert's looking further afield.
- Alright.

01:30:56.733 --> 01:30:59.518
- I'll call you later.
- Alright.

01:31:01.899 --> 01:31:04.602
- He's gone crazy.
- 280,000.

01:31:04.941 --> 01:31:07.062
310,000. Any more?

01:31:07.942 --> 01:31:10.231
Sold!

01:31:10.567 --> 01:31:14.432
I'm doing the rounds of the
hospitals, but there's nothing.

01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:15.806
Just keep looking.

01:31:15.984 --> 01:31:18.602
- We'll find her. I'll keep in touch.
- Thanks.

01:31:19.651 --> 01:31:21.227
Lot number 2.

01:31:21.402 --> 01:31:24.315
A 17th-century
Fassadenschranke wardrobe

01:31:24.483 --> 01:31:26.310
in walnut, Maple, oak and ash.

01:31:26.485 --> 01:31:29.153
The carved frame surmounts
an inlaid stripe,

01:31:29.486 --> 01:31:32.767
and two doors engraved
with architectural motifs,

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:35.100
surrounded by carvings of fruit.

01:31:35.443 --> 01:31:38.561
Three spiraled, tapered
columns flank the doors.

01:31:38.899 --> 01:31:41.935
The lower body has two drawers.

01:31:44.944 --> 01:31:46.141
And um...

01:31:50.694 --> 01:31:53.809
There's nothing for it
but to call the police.

01:31:53.984 --> 01:31:56.853
It'll be all over the papers.
They'll drag me into it.

01:31:57.025 --> 01:31:58.485
Let's wait a bit longer.

01:31:58.819 --> 01:32:00.396
What do you hope will happen?

01:32:00.737 --> 01:32:04.065
That she'll come back...
or turn up.

01:32:05.403 --> 01:32:08.071
Or they'll find
out where she is.

01:32:08.238 --> 01:32:11.980
Someone with her problems doesn't
just disappear into thin air.

01:32:12.153 --> 01:32:14.225
Well, that depends.

01:32:14.568 --> 01:32:16.442
No matter how deeply
rooted it is,

01:32:16.611 --> 01:32:19.396
sometimes a phobia can
just disappear by itself.

01:32:19.737 --> 01:32:21.395
So, why did she run away?

01:32:21.571 --> 01:32:23.690
Maybe something
happened between you

01:32:24.027 --> 01:32:26.598
that drove her to take
that kind of decision.

01:32:26.777 --> 01:32:30.061
You know perfectly well
that's impossible.

01:32:30.237 --> 01:32:33.071
You're the only person
who knows everything

01:32:33.239 --> 01:32:34.942
that happened between us.

01:32:38.487 --> 01:32:40.727
Excuse me a minute.

01:33:00.197 --> 01:33:03.195
- Hello?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman.

01:33:03.364 --> 01:33:05.768
I've called all the
publishers in existence

01:33:05.946 --> 01:33:07.983
but none of them
knows who she is.

01:33:08.154 --> 01:33:10.394
They said that often
even they don't know

01:33:10.572 --> 01:33:13.736
the identity of authors
who use pseudonyms.

01:33:14.073 --> 01:33:16.228
I'd never have guessed that you

01:33:16.405 --> 01:33:18.858
would have ended up
in a mess like this.

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:22.811
- I don't know how I can help you.
- All you had to do was listen.

01:33:23.156 --> 01:33:25.312
Ah.

01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:29.945
Considering the lady's illness,
it seems highly unrealistic

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.106
that she's just run away.

01:33:33.406 --> 01:33:37.813
I'd say, I don't know, she'd
been abducted or something.

01:33:38.156 --> 01:33:41.072
That's not likely. I don't
think she had any enemies.

01:33:41.407 --> 01:33:44.772
It could be somebody became
so besotted with her

01:33:44.948 --> 01:33:46.524
and carried her off by force.

01:33:46.864 --> 01:33:50.278
- But who?
- I've had my doubts about Robert.

01:33:50.615 --> 01:33:51.645
The young guy?

01:33:51.989 --> 01:33:54.989
The way you describe him,
he doesn't seem the type.

01:33:55.324 --> 01:33:58.488
From the literary point of
view, he fits the bill.

01:33:59.616 --> 01:34:01.652
The young knight
rescuing the damsel

01:34:01.824 --> 01:34:05.272
from the clutches of the
old man incapable of love.

01:34:05.616 --> 01:34:08.364
Literature, exactly.

01:34:08.697 --> 01:34:10.688
Don't go overboard, Virgil.

01:34:11.032 --> 01:34:14.316
She could have had her own
reasons for disappearing.

01:34:14.657 --> 01:34:17.147
I can't imagine what reasons.

01:34:17.492 --> 01:34:20.690
Recently, she's been experiencing
emotions and feelings

01:34:20.866 --> 01:34:23.152
that are incompatible
with flight.

01:34:23.490 --> 01:34:25.481
I wouldn't be so
sure, if I were you.

01:34:25.824 --> 01:34:28.312
Human emotions are
like works of art.

01:34:28.657 --> 01:34:30.365
They can be forged.

01:34:30.533 --> 01:34:34.445
They seem just like the original,
but they're a forgery.

01:34:36.993 --> 01:34:40.937
- Forgery?
- Everything can be faked, Virgil.

01:34:41.282 --> 01:34:44.233
Joy, pain, hate.

01:34:45.783 --> 01:34:48.239
Illness, recovery.

01:34:49.783 --> 01:34:51.857
Even love.

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.443
- Hello?
- Listen.

01:35:11.617 --> 01:35:14.154
There's something that
hadn't occurred to us.

01:35:14.326 --> 01:35:18.366
Are you sure there are no other
secret rooms in the villa?

01:35:18.535 --> 01:35:20.654
I don't remember
any other doors

01:35:20.825 --> 01:35:23.031
like the one to Miss
lbbetson's room.

01:35:24.451 --> 01:35:26.692
Claire!

01:35:26.868 --> 01:35:31.573
The only place we haven't looked
at is the attic... if you want?

01:35:37.535 --> 01:35:40.368
Did you know that Miss
Claire was a writer?

01:35:40.534 --> 01:35:43.107
I heard her parents
talk about it.

01:35:43.285 --> 01:35:46.319
She used a pseudonym
for her books.

01:35:46.495 --> 01:35:50.404
I never knew that. I've
never seen the books.

01:35:50.743 --> 01:35:52.484
She never wanted them here.

01:35:52.826 --> 01:35:54.201
Claire!

01:35:55.495 --> 01:35:58.777
We're wasting time. There
are no other secret rooms.

01:35:58.954 --> 01:36:00.529
You've come back.

01:36:00.703 --> 01:36:02.528
- We should...
- Quiet!

01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:04.197
You've...

01:36:05.369 --> 01:36:06.779
You've come back.

01:36:06.953 --> 01:36:08.826
You've...

01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:12.695
You've come back.

01:36:13.035 --> 01:36:16.237
You've... Claire?

01:36:21.578 --> 01:36:25.277
Claire, I can feel you're there.
Answer me.

01:36:27.746 --> 01:36:29.238
You've come back.

01:36:32.079 --> 01:36:35.159
- You've come back.
- Of course I have.

01:36:36.496 --> 01:36:38.154
Were you afraid I wouldn't?

01:36:50.121 --> 01:36:53.072
I thought you'd abandoned me.

01:36:53.245 --> 01:36:56.742
- Like last time.
- Last time?

01:36:57.080 --> 01:36:59.913
When we got back from Prague.

01:37:03.081 --> 01:37:04.406
Claire.

01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:28.404
I will never abandon you.

01:37:31.957 --> 01:37:35.486
I'd been happy in Prague in
that very odd restaurant.

01:37:38.165 --> 01:37:41.080
I was there with my first
and only boyfriend.

01:37:43.248 --> 01:37:44.871
He was older than me.

01:37:49.748 --> 01:37:52.451
When we got back
from that excursion,

01:37:52.624 --> 01:37:55.537
one afternoon, we were
walking in the city Centre.

01:37:58.375 --> 01:38:00.448
A car crashed into us.

01:38:01.624 --> 01:38:05.369
When I came to, he
wasn't there anymore.

01:38:26.875 --> 01:38:31.249
I went back home and I
never went out again.

01:38:59.626 --> 01:39:01.783
I've never slept with a woman.

01:39:02.127 --> 01:39:05.124
In fact, I didn't close my eyes.

01:39:05.459 --> 01:39:08.956
I spent the whole night
just looking at her.

01:39:09.292 --> 01:39:13.536
- It was wonderful.
- Well, welcome to the grown-up club.

01:39:13.878 --> 01:39:16.661
You've succeeded in
making her fall in love.

01:39:18.375 --> 01:39:20.248
I had a good teacher.

01:39:22.752 --> 01:39:24.908
I understood where
the dwarf hid.

01:39:25.252 --> 01:39:28.119
Look, there must have been
a sunken pedestal here.

01:39:28.461 --> 01:39:30.085
He would crouch in there

01:39:30.253 --> 01:39:32.657
and his voice would
reverberate in the body.

01:39:32.836 --> 01:39:34.625
It must have made an impression.

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:37.081
Do you think love can be faked?

01:39:41.836 --> 01:39:44.668
In keeping with what you
say about art forgeries,

01:39:45.005 --> 01:39:47.326
I'd say it can't be
completely faked.

01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:49.707
If one could say love
is a work of art.

01:39:50.045 --> 01:39:52.532
It'd be amazing if it
were, wouldn't it?

01:39:52.711 --> 01:39:54.583
It could be sold
off at an auction.

01:39:54.919 --> 01:39:58.581
The highest bidder could relive
the greatest love stories.

01:39:58.753 --> 01:40:01.241
I hope I haven't destroyed
your love story.

01:40:01.587 --> 01:40:03.493
No problem. No problem.

01:40:03.838 --> 01:40:06.242
A new valve, two
hinges, one fuse...

01:40:06.419 --> 01:40:08.875
It'll be good as new.
Just like the first day.

01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:11.534
What do you think
you're going to do now?

01:40:13.503 --> 01:40:15.827
I want to coax her out.

01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:20.034
Yeah, I wouldn't push
too hard if I were you.

01:40:20.379 --> 01:40:22.453
She's too fragile.

01:40:22.796 --> 01:40:27.169
You'll see. When you least expect it,
things will fall into place naturally.

01:40:42.338 --> 01:40:46.247
No!

01:41:34.549 --> 01:41:38.709
Hello? Hello?

01:41:38.882 --> 01:41:41.717
Virgil? Virgil, is that you?

01:42:14.091 --> 01:42:16.759
Virgil! Virgil!

01:42:22.924 --> 01:42:24.833
Virgil?

01:42:45.465 --> 01:42:47.257
Help! Help!

01:42:48.593 --> 01:42:51.128
- Hold it up!
- It is up!

01:43:20.385 --> 01:43:23.135
Why don't you love it?

01:43:23.302 --> 01:43:27.132
I've never felt it to be a
real home. More like a hotel.

01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:29.590
You come home a night,
sleep if you can.

01:43:29.762 --> 01:43:32.131
Next morning, you're
off somewhere else.

01:43:33.469 --> 01:43:35.543
Let's go back inside.

01:43:36.926 --> 01:43:40.709
Seems to have been planned
to welcome a lot of people.

01:43:40.887 --> 01:43:44.251
Yes, but the plan
was never realized.

01:43:44.428 --> 01:43:47.094
Except for the
inaugural reception.

01:43:47.428 --> 01:43:49.383
I was so distrustful
of other people

01:43:49.553 --> 01:43:54.257
that I kept them away from the
perimeter of my personal hotel.

01:43:56.554 --> 01:43:58.424
I was a fool.

01:43:59.887 --> 01:44:01.464
Even now, I still get upset

01:44:01.638 --> 01:44:04.920
when I see the housekeeper
and the maids walking about.

01:44:05.095 --> 01:44:07.169
After dinner, I send them home.

01:44:08.721 --> 01:44:11.255
I wasn't wrong when I said
we were very similar.

01:44:11.429 --> 01:44:13.170
Yes, you were right.

01:44:14.845 --> 01:44:16.920
And thanks to you, I understood.

01:44:35.138 --> 01:44:37.757
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll soon find out.

01:44:39.972 --> 01:44:43.881
Close your eyes. I'll tell
you when you can open them.

01:44:52.473 --> 01:44:55.220
Don't be afraid.
I'll lead the way.

01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:58.670
I never liked games where
you had to close your eyes.

01:45:05.973 --> 01:45:09.503
- Mind the step.
- Gently, please.

01:45:13.722 --> 01:45:14.966
We're almost there.

01:45:16.598 --> 01:45:18.007
Stop now.

01:45:20.306 --> 01:45:22.013
Open your eyes.

01:45:29.847 --> 01:45:31.553
I don't believe it.

01:45:35.056 --> 01:45:36.550
It's overwhelming.

01:45:37.182 --> 01:45:39.507
I've been collecting
them all my life.

01:45:41.517 --> 01:45:44.596
So, I'm not the first. You
have had other women.

01:45:44.931 --> 01:45:47.301
Yes.

01:45:47.474 --> 01:45:50.045
I've loved them all and
they loved me back.

01:45:50.391 --> 01:45:52.513
They taught me to wait for you.

01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:56.175
And now that you're here,

01:45:56.351 --> 01:45:58.554
we'd like you to come
and live with us

01:45:58.725 --> 01:46:01.177
and make this beautiful
hotel your home.

01:46:02.724 --> 01:46:04.264
Oh, Virgil.

01:46:06.932 --> 01:46:09.423
If anything should
ever happen to us,

01:46:09.601 --> 01:46:11.673
I want you to know
that I do love you.

01:46:13.891 --> 01:46:15.515
I love you too.

01:46:15.683 --> 01:46:19.346
The catalogue for the sale of
the paintings and furniture

01:46:19.518 --> 01:46:21.009
of Ibbetson Villa is ready.

01:46:21.183 --> 01:46:24.632
Congratulations. It's a
lovely volume. About time!

01:46:26.308 --> 01:46:29.343
I wonder who'll buy this
wonderful stuff... Oh, sorry.

01:46:29.519 --> 01:46:32.847
I can't conceal my anxiety to
know what you think about it.

01:46:43.684 --> 01:46:45.225
Well, don't you like it?

01:46:47.934 --> 01:46:49.309
No, it's just that...

01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:54.094
ever since I decided to
come and live with you...

01:46:55.686 --> 01:46:59.382
I've been thinking I...
don't want to sell anymore.

01:47:01.769 --> 01:47:04.138
I'd like to leave
everything the way it was.

01:47:10.977 --> 01:47:12.054
I understand.

01:47:13.101 --> 01:47:14.131
Are you sure?

01:47:14.977 --> 01:47:17.512
Believe me, if I were you,
I'd do the same thing.

01:47:19.685 --> 01:47:23.051
Tomorrow, everything will
be back in it's place.

01:47:26.101 --> 01:47:27.265
Alright, Virgil!

01:47:31.979 --> 01:47:36.136
To the most tortured and most
fortunate catalogue of my career.

01:47:36.312 --> 01:47:37.970
That's saying something.

01:47:38.144 --> 01:47:40.181
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

01:47:41.770 --> 01:47:44.174
And since you've
become my family...

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:48.764
I too have an important
announcement to make.

01:47:49.605 --> 01:47:51.808
Next week, I have an
auction in London.

01:47:52.146 --> 01:47:55.510
It will be the finest of my
career and the very last.

01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:04.060
They say he's been seen
recently in female company.

01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:05.971
- Who? Virgil?
- Yes.

01:48:06.147 --> 01:48:10.271
It's finally come home to him that the
worst sexual perversion is Chastity.

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:14.098
How is it going onstage
for the last time?

01:48:14.272 --> 01:48:18.133
I've never felt better. There's a
whiff of anticipation in the air.

01:48:18.313 --> 01:48:20.600
All my colleagues have
come to see me off.

01:48:20.771 --> 01:48:22.146
That's nice of them.

01:48:22.314 --> 01:48:26.141
This affection is because they won't
have to put up with me anymore.

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:31.727
Anyhow, I'm happy, Claire.
I just wish you were here.

01:48:31.896 --> 01:48:33.355
Me too.

01:48:33.522 --> 01:48:36.970
But I'm not ready to travel yet. I
got dizzy in the car yesterday.

01:48:37.146 --> 01:48:40.678
Don't let it get to you. We have all
the time in the world to travel.

01:48:40.855 --> 01:48:43.011
- We're ready, Mr. Oldman.
- I'm coming.

01:48:43.897 --> 01:48:46.101
Have you heard from
our young friends?

01:48:46.273 --> 01:48:49.056
Constantly. I'm never
left on my own.

01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:51.269
Good. Give them my love.

01:48:52.439 --> 01:48:55.106
- I can hear you've got to go.
- Yes.

01:48:56.190 --> 01:48:59.721
- But I can't wait to get back home.
- Good luck, my darling.

01:49:00.690 --> 01:49:03.144
£12,100,000.

01:49:06.316 --> 01:49:07.723
Any more?

01:49:09.605 --> 01:49:12.011
£12,300,000.

01:49:13.316 --> 01:49:14.856
Any advance?

01:49:17.857 --> 01:49:20.346
£12,500,000 on the telephone.

01:49:21.857 --> 01:49:23.848
Any more?

01:49:24.023 --> 01:49:26.641
All done at £12,500,000.

01:49:26.982 --> 01:49:30.478
Sold for £12,500,000.

01:49:31.815 --> 01:49:35.182
Ladies and gentlemen,
I thank you.

01:49:47.526 --> 01:49:50.855
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Not a bad price.

01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:53.347
Can I say hello
to you in public?

01:49:53.524 --> 01:49:55.514
Oh, Billy.

01:49:55.857 --> 01:49:59.982
You were fantastic, my friend! I'm
happy for you. I'm going to miss you.

01:50:00.316 --> 01:50:02.521
You say it like we'll
never meet again.

01:50:02.941 --> 01:50:04.435
Of course we will.

01:50:04.608 --> 01:50:08.139
But I'm feeling nostalgic
thinking about all our exploits.

01:50:08.859 --> 01:50:10.765
- You'll get over it.
- Virgil?

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:14.685
To remind you of what a great
artist I could've been

01:50:15.025 --> 01:50:18.890
if only you'd believed in me, I've
sent you one of my paintings.

01:50:19.068 --> 01:50:20.857
I promise I won't burn it.

01:50:31.151 --> 01:50:32.691
Claire.

01:50:34.234 --> 01:50:35.776
Claire, I'm back!

01:50:37.776 --> 01:50:39.318
Hello?

01:50:42.526 --> 01:50:45.394
- Have you seen Miss Claire?
- No, Sir.

01:50:45.776 --> 01:50:47.318
Claire?

01:50:48.944 --> 01:50:50.353
Where are you?

01:50:52.112 --> 01:50:53.273
Claire?

01:50:54.486 --> 01:50:57.270
Mr. Oldman, she
must have gone out.

01:50:57.611 --> 01:50:59.068
It was the same yesterday.

01:50:59.235 --> 01:51:02.565
Sarah and Robert came to get
her, then came back for lunch.

01:51:02.735 --> 01:51:03.978
Alright.

01:52:27.446 --> 01:52:29.355
"There is always

01:52:29.531 --> 01:52:32.564
something authentic concealed
in every forgery."

01:52:32.739 --> 01:52:36.151
I couldn't agree more. That's
why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

01:52:36.321 --> 01:52:38.527
"There is always
something authentic

01:52:38.696 --> 01:52:40.486
concealed in every forgery."

01:52:40.656 --> 01:52:42.529
I couldn't agree more.

01:52:42.698 --> 01:52:45.316
That's why I'll miss
you, Mr. Oldman.

01:52:45.488 --> 01:52:47.694
"There is always
something authentic

01:52:47.865 --> 01:52:49.606
concealed in every forgery."

01:52:49.782 --> 01:52:51.654
I couldn't agree more.

01:52:51.822 --> 01:52:54.441
That's why I'll miss
you, Mr. Oldman.

01:52:54.613 --> 01:52:56.735
"There is always
something authentic

01:52:56.905 --> 01:52:58.613
concealed in every forgery."

01:52:58.948 --> 01:53:02.944
I couldn't agree more. That's
why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

01:53:03.116 --> 01:53:05.272
"There is always
something authentic

01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:07.155
concealed in every forgery."

01:53:07.324 --> 01:53:09.361
I couldn't agree more.

01:53:09.531 --> 01:53:11.568
That's why I'll miss
you, Mr. Oldman.

01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:15.188
"There is always something
authentic concealed in every..."

01:53:31.698 --> 01:53:35.693
Good morning, Mr. Oldman.
We have visitors today.

01:53:35.864 --> 01:53:38.984
Isn't this nice? Look
who's come to see you!

01:53:46.532 --> 01:53:48.690
How are you, Mr. Oldman?

01:53:53.324 --> 01:53:55.067
I've brought your mail,

01:53:55.410 --> 01:53:58.691
some newspapers and
a few magazines.

01:55:25.578 --> 01:55:29.442
A few days ago, they brought some
furniture to the villa opposite.

01:55:32.996 --> 01:55:34.158
Did you notice?

01:55:34.954 --> 01:55:37.822
I think so, but I don't
see much from in here.

01:55:38.537 --> 01:55:39.567
Ask her.

01:55:47.621 --> 01:55:49.031
Claire?

01:55:49.204 --> 01:55:51.658
Listen to what this
gentleman wants to say.

01:55:52.789 --> 01:55:53.819
Yes.

01:55:55.204 --> 01:55:56.614
And the day after,

01:55:56.789 --> 01:56:00.036
other workmen came and took
everything away again.

01:56:02.163 --> 01:56:03.703
The day after?

01:56:04.996 --> 01:56:08.943
In 18 months, three deliveries
and three removals.

01:56:11.915 --> 01:56:14.200
I was here a while ago.

01:56:15.497 --> 01:56:17.701
- Do you remember?
- Nine.

01:56:20.163 --> 01:56:24.111
- What do you mean?
- You've been here nine times.

01:56:26.165 --> 01:56:27.622
Today makes 10.

01:56:27.957 --> 01:56:31.570
I was wondering if you saw
a woman leave the villa.

01:56:32.829 --> 01:56:36.030
Medium height, light
hair, a bit pale?

01:56:37.330 --> 01:56:41.196
- Yes.
- That time was 231.

01:56:42.792 --> 01:56:44.247
Are you sure?

01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:46.240
Then another six.

01:56:47.083 --> 01:56:52.034
In a year and a half, I
saw her go out 237 times.

01:56:52.413 --> 01:56:53.824
What did I say?

01:56:53.998 --> 01:56:56.452
She's a phenomenon,
remembers everything.

01:56:58.499 --> 01:57:00.040
It's not possible.

01:57:02.581 --> 01:57:04.702
You were at the villa 63 times.

01:57:05.041 --> 01:57:08.951
36 during the day
and 27 at night,

01:57:09.290 --> 01:57:11.613
excluding the night
of the accident.

01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:16.495
- One, four, four.
- One, four, four?

01:57:16.833 --> 01:57:19.073
The telephone number
for the ambulance.

01:57:20.541 --> 01:57:22.118
The villa is free now.

01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:25.415
If you're interested,
I'll get you a good deal.

01:57:27.042 --> 01:57:29.658
- Who owns it?
- Me.

01:57:30.875 --> 01:57:32.949
But I don't know
what to do with it.

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:36.708
I often rent it out
to cinema people.

01:57:37.624 --> 01:57:38.999
Cinema people?

01:57:39.584 --> 01:57:42.534
For the past two years, it's
been taken by the engineer

01:57:42.710 --> 01:57:45.244
who does the lift that
takes me up to my house.

01:57:46.041 --> 01:57:47.748
He's really nice, that boy.

01:57:48.668 --> 01:57:50.325
He can do anything.

01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.991
There's nothing he can't fix.

01:57:53.583 --> 01:57:56.915
And he's always kissing me.

01:57:57.083 --> 01:57:58.875
Bringing me flowers.

02:00:44.214 --> 02:00:47.996
The Paris Express is now
arriving at platform seven.

02:00:49.465 --> 02:00:51.171
Your attention, please.

02:00:51.339 --> 02:00:54.173
The Berlin-Prague Arrow is
running 40 minutes late

02:00:54.339 --> 02:00:55.537
due to fog on the line.

02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:58.923
Come in, Sir.

02:01:00.257 --> 02:01:02.627
We furnished it exactly
as you requested.

02:01:04.049 --> 02:01:06.538
And tomorrow, your trunks
will be delivered.

02:01:06.716 --> 02:01:09.833
And later, I'll pass by with
a copy of your contract.

02:01:10.176 --> 02:01:13.541
If there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

02:01:20.008 --> 02:01:21.549
Oh, Virgil.

02:01:22.966 --> 02:01:27.174
If anything should happen to us, I
want you to know that I do love you.

02:03:50.972 --> 02:03:53.045
Are you on your own, Sir?

02:04:03.681 --> 02:04:06.385
No. I'm waiting for someone.
