00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.375
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.709 --> 00:10.178
sexually based offenses

00:10.178 --> 00:12.180
are considered especially
heinous.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.548
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.548 --> 00:16.250
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.250 --> 00:17.918
are members of an elite squad

00:17.918 --> 00:19.953
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.589
These are their stories.

00:39.407 --> 00:42.643
- I-I don't trust any of them,
but at least--

00:42.643 --> 00:45.379
At least he looks--
He looks honest.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.748
- I had my heart set on a place
in Bushwick last spring.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.817
Couldn't find a two-bedroom
for less than $3,500.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.919
- A month?
- Yeah.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.254
- For a two-bedroom?
- Pathetic.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.655
- In Bushwick?
- I know!

00:54.655 --> 00:56.390
- Man! Where do you get
that kind of money?

00:56.390 --> 00:59.026
Where do you get
that kind of money?

00:59.026 --> 01:00.528
You know, I don't understand
Brooklyn anymore.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.130
I really don't.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.997
- This is what men talk about
when their wives aren't around?

01:03.997 --> 01:05.966
- There's no way
that girl's 18.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.136
Hang on.
Is that Judge Wheeler?

01:08.136 --> 01:10.037
- Yeah, I see a Bronx ADA,
two assemblymen,

01:10.037 --> 01:11.805
and a councilman, too.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.142
- You think this nurse knew
what she was tipping us off to?

01:14.142 --> 01:15.509
- Maybe.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.844
She said that the girls
were scared,

01:16.844 --> 01:19.647
and she wouldn't give up
any names.

01:19.647 --> 01:25.853
*

01:25.853 --> 01:28.856
- Okay, when do we move in?
- Easy, Dodds.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.224
We gotta wait

01:30.224 --> 01:31.825
till they do something
more incriminating.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.361
- How close do you
wanna cut it?

01:33.361 --> 01:35.663
Because Judge Wheeler has
his hand up that girl's skirt.

01:35.663 --> 01:39.066
[girl coughing]

01:39.066 --> 01:40.934
Where are you going,
young lady?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.670
- I just need to use
the bathroom.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.773
- Stay a little longer.
We don't bite.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.475
- Hey, excuse me,
you need some water?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.710
- She's fine.
You'll get your turn.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.011
- What's going on here?

01:51.011 --> 01:52.946
- Nothing.
There's no problem.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.948
- Like she said, no problem.
Girl just needs a break.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.285
- Hey, Jersey,
mind your own business.

01:57.285 --> 01:58.386
- Get your hands off me.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.887
- John, come on, not tonight.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.589
- You wanna do this?
Let's go!

02:01.589 --> 02:05.025
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, you're done, pal.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.594
- That's enough!
Back off!

02:06.594 --> 02:08.962
- Gun, gun, they got a gun.
Dodds, Rollins, go.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.968
- All right, all right,
my mistake. All right--

02:14.968 --> 02:17.104
- NYPD, hands up!
- Hands up!

02:17.104 --> 02:18.806
You guys move over
where we can see you.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.441
Are you going somewhere?

02:20.441 --> 02:23.444
Get him out of here.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.314
Lieutenant Benson.
Guns down now!

02:26.314 --> 02:29.650
- We're on the job.
Vice.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.619
- SVU.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.288
- Color of the day.
- Yellow.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.224
- Son of a bitch.

02:36.224 --> 02:39.893
- Lieutenant, you just derailed
a two-year operation.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.896
[dramatic music]

02:42.896 --> 02:47.335
*

02:48.802 --> 02:51.805
[dramatic music]

03:35.316 --> 03:35.449
.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.385
- Listen, girls, I need to know
how you heard about this party.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.121
How you got there.
- From friends.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.756
- What friends?
What are--what are their names?

03:42.756 --> 03:43.957
- They weren't really friends.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.626
We met them
at a Wiz Khalifa concert.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.095
They told us about it.
- And what did they say exactly?

03:48.095 --> 03:50.364
- Lieutenant.
What fresh hell awaits?

03:50.364 --> 03:52.333
- We responded to a tip
that underage girls

03:52.333 --> 03:53.767
would be at a sex party,

03:53.767 --> 03:56.837
and in attendance
was Bronx ADA Winn,

03:56.837 --> 03:59.707
two assemblymen,
a retired D.A. investigator,

03:59.707 --> 04:03.844
a councilman, and I'm sure
that you recognize...

04:03.844 --> 04:06.914
- Judge Wheeler.
Why am I not surprised?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.716
What about the girls?
Are they talking?

04:08.716 --> 04:11.385
- Oh, no. Their pimps have them
completely under control.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.053
Haven't even bothered
to send a lawyer,

04:13.053 --> 04:15.889
and no one will admit to knowing
whose party it was,

04:15.889 --> 04:17.791
who supplied the girls--
- All par for the course.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.760
- Well, it gets worse.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.696
Detectives Russo and Jefferson,
Vice, were working the case

04:22.696 --> 04:24.332
from another angle.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.967
They pulled their guns
and badges as we made the bust.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.336
- They must know
who threw the party.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.770
- Well, if they do,
they're not saying.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.605
They claimed that we ruined
their UC operation.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.641
Don't worry,
I called their captain.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.476
- You mean he wasn't there too?

04:35.476 --> 04:38.111
Was there anybody at this party
who wasn't a public servant?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.347
- Her.

04:39.347 --> 04:42.215
Nina Kelly.
This is her only ID.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.984
- She's a nun.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.487
- Well, we're trying
to verify.

04:48.456 --> 04:51.959
Nina, so I was just talking
to our ADA,

04:51.959 --> 04:56.364
and he was wondering why a nun
would be at a sex party.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.733
- I'm not comfortable with him.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.169
- The sister would prefer
to talk to a woman.

05:02.169 --> 05:05.172
So I'm gonna take
another run at the johns.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.812
- [sighs] Thank you.
I'm--

05:11.812 --> 05:13.647
I'm not comfortable
with male cops.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.248
- Oh, I can imagine.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.651
As a madam, you've had
your share of run-ins, huh?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.587
- You know, I-I'm not a madam.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.989
- So what are you?
Waitress?

05:21.989 --> 05:24.392
- I'm a nun.

05:24.392 --> 05:27.528
Look, I-I've spent months
trying to infiltrate this ring

05:27.528 --> 05:29.397
to save the girls.

05:29.397 --> 05:32.299
You saw who was there.
Politicians, police.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.667
It's rigged.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.837
- Well, I'm...not part
of the good old boy network.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.839
So why don't you work
with me, Nina?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.408
- [sighs]

05:40.408 --> 05:44.011
- Why don't you tell me
who throws these parties,

05:44.011 --> 05:46.246
who procures these girls,

05:46.246 --> 05:49.082
and I will go after them, and
get those girls to a shelter.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.251
- No. Look, if they think
I'm cooperating,

05:51.251 --> 05:53.421
I won't be able
to save anyone else.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.855
It took a long time.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.224
I had to earn the trust
of a lot of people.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.192
- Who?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.094
Who hired you?

06:01.094 --> 06:03.130
- Why don't you ask
the johns that?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.765
- Because they haven't
been forthcoming.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.435
- Yeah. Yeah, of course
they haven't.

06:07.435 --> 06:10.003
Because they know
they'll get away with it.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.774
- Look, Dodds, right?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.108
We'd like to help you out,
man,

06:15.108 --> 06:16.544
but this is way
above our pay grade.

06:16.544 --> 06:20.514
- Mm. Well, your Captain
is on his way.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.049
Hey, out of curiosity,

06:22.049 --> 06:23.917
how were you guys
in there undercover,

06:23.917 --> 06:25.252
with badges and guns?

06:25.252 --> 06:28.155
- We're dirty cops.
That's our cover story.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.790
- Okay.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.191
- They like to have us
at the parties,

06:31.191 --> 06:32.560
to keep everybody in line.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.528
- Yeah?
They?

06:38.165 --> 06:40.534
Hey, come on, fellows.
Throw me a bone here.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.636
I mean, there's nothing
in the system about you guys

06:42.636 --> 06:44.137
being undercover there.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.039
- Our captain told us
straight up

06:46.039 --> 06:48.909
not to put this into DECS--

06:48.909 --> 06:50.878
Too many of the johns
have access.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.847
- Hey!
Hey, hey.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.282
- Captain Gerbic.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.851
I am sorry to drag you down here
in the middle of the night.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.186
- Oh, Vice never sleeps.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.655
It looks like the same
can be said for SVU.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.090
I didn't know
you were still here.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.092
Your father said
you were moving up.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.160
- Oh, my lieutenant
has a few questions.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.897
- Absolutely.
One minute, fellows.

07:09.897 --> 07:10.931
- Cap.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.637
- Ah, well, this
is a cluster, huh?

07:16.637 --> 07:18.772
- The timing was...bad.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.742
I know your guys' cover was
blown, and this is not ideal.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.511
- To say the least.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.112
We gotta get new guys
in there now.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.514
Sets us back big-time.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.281
And what were your people
doing at this party

07:28.281 --> 07:29.282
in the first place?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.018
- Actually, an anonymous tip.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.754
But I'm hoping now that
we're all in this together

07:33.754 --> 07:35.422
that we could--
- No, I wish I could help.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.857
But we're playing
the long game here.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.527
You've seen the pedigree
of your johns.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.328
Anybody talking?
- Not yet.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.630
- No, no.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.334
Ask yourself why.
Who are they protecting?

07:49.002 --> 07:51.705
This is deep UC.
I'm going out on a limb here

07:51.705 --> 07:53.874
even acknowledging this--
- And I appreciate that.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.144
But underage girls are still
being raped and trafficked.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.213
- Well, where SVU sees victims,
we see willing participants.

08:00.213 --> 08:04.284
These girls
are not exactly madonnas.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.386
Well, okay.
Never mind that.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.922
We care just as much about
these traffickers as you do.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.691
We are gonna nail these guys.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.893
- I just think that SVU is
better equipped to deal with--

08:12.893 --> 08:14.562
- I hear you,
but we're already inside.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.597
You move in now,
the carnival just picks up,

08:16.597 --> 08:17.765
goes to a different lot,

08:17.765 --> 08:20.433
and the games
keep getting played.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.603
Now, how about I get
my guys out of here?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.938
- You know what? Let me run it
by the ADA first.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.874
- Why don't you call
the Deputy Inspector?

08:26.874 --> 08:30.343
See what he says.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.587
- So that's it?
We're shut out?

08:39.587 --> 08:41.655
- They say they're deep UC.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.758
So if they are investigating
that, I mean, I get it.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.995
- Okay, so a UC investigation
that we can't investigate

08:47.995 --> 08:49.997
because of who
they're investigating.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.498
That's a Mobius strip.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.333
- Maybe my father
has some intel.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.903
- It's worth a try.
- Yeah.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.606
- So all these girls
are with Social Services?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.608
- I'll take another run
at them tomorrow.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.109
- Please.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.979
- Hey, Lieutenant, what?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.615
We'll just let
these johns go too?

09:07.615 --> 09:10.183
- For now.
I'll call Barba--or not.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.686
- Lieutenant Benson?

09:12.686 --> 09:15.322
- Sister, something the matter?
- Yeah, I don't understand.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.057
You're just gonna let
those bastards go?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.859
- Sister, that's none
of your concern.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.427
- So because they have badges,

09:20.427 --> 09:24.131
it makes it okay for them to
assault 16-year-old girls?

09:26.700 --> 09:28.101
- What are you talking about?

09:28.101 --> 09:30.671
- Multiple girls.
Multiple times.

09:30.671 --> 09:34.207
They're not cops.
They're rapists.

09:34.207 --> 09:40.280
*

09:40.280 --> 09:42.182
- Yes. That's Sister Nina.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.917
- So you know her.
- Very well.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.654
She's brought several abused and
trafficked girls to our shelter.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.088
She's doing God's work.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.890
Is Sister Nina in trouble?

09:49.890 --> 09:52.793
- [sighs]
She was picked up in a raid.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.062
We have her
in our holding cell.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.665
She claims she knows
about dirty cops

09:57.665 --> 09:59.733
who are raping teenage girls.

09:59.733 --> 10:03.971
- If Sister Nina says
it happened, it happened.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.406
- Okay, she--she gave me
one name of a girl

10:06.406 --> 10:08.408
that she brought to you,
Cara Gutierrez?

10:08.408 --> 10:09.910
- Oh, yes.
Nina brought Cara here

10:09.910 --> 10:11.645
about six months ago.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.981
Very troubled girl,
but I believe she's healing.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.616
- So would it be possible for me
to speak with her?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.052
- She won't say a word
unless Sister Nina is with her.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.454
- Of course.
I understand.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.290
Thank you.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.159
- It's good to see you again.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.627
- Ah...

10:27.627 --> 10:31.431
- How's her little boy, Noah?
You adopted him, yes?

10:31.431 --> 10:35.302
- I did.
He's, um...

10:35.302 --> 10:37.170
He's thriving.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.707
- We still say the Rosary for
Ellie every year.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.109
- Thank you.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.979
Cara:
I'm not sure.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.615
- These detectives
are on our side, Cara.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.591
- That one.
He's one of them.

10:58.591 --> 10:59.626
- Russo.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.197
What did he do, exactly?

11:05.598 --> 11:08.736
- He was...
at all the parties,

11:08.736 --> 11:11.805
always grabbing us,
touching us...

11:13.340 --> 11:15.642
Making us do stuff.

11:17.044 --> 11:20.513
His partner too.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.215
That one.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.616
- It's Jefferson.

11:25.753 --> 11:30.590
- Cara,
I know how hard this is,

11:30.590 --> 11:34.928
and I need you to tell us
exactly what happened.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.332
- Go ahead, Cara.
It's okay.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.206
- They were always there first.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.376
They'd make me and some
other girls go down on them.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.812
- They forced you...
to perform oral sex.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.213
- Mm-hmm.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.247
[sighs]

11:54.247 --> 11:57.450
We had to pretend
we liked them.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.120
My last party,
somewhere on Edgecombe Avenue,

12:00.120 --> 12:04.992
they...they got really drunk.

12:04.992 --> 12:08.328
They forced me into a room
and took turns raping me.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.866
I started crying,
but they didn't care.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.335
- Did you tell anybody
afterwards?

12:15.335 --> 12:16.804
- No.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.973
Not right away, but Sister Nina
looked out for me.

12:19.973 --> 12:23.076
- Cara was skeptical at first,
but...

12:23.076 --> 12:25.545
eventually
we established a bond.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.580
That's why she disclosed
to me that night,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.682
and I brought her to the E.R.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.184
- Did she do a rape kit?

12:31.184 --> 12:34.221
- No. Cara would run away.
We'd have lost her.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.156
- Then Sister Nina
took me here.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.926
- Cara...

12:38.926 --> 12:40.660
who took you
to these parties?

12:40.660 --> 12:42.662
- No!

12:42.662 --> 12:45.999
She's not talking about that.
That is too dangerous.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.036
[tense music]

12:54.875 --> 12:55.008
.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.576
- So you bust a sex party
and find a madam who says

12:57.978 --> 12:59.847
she's a nun?
- Which we confirmed.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.015
- And two Vice cops
who say they're undercover.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.484
- Yeah, and now we have
a teenage vic who claims

13:04.484 --> 13:05.853
that these guys raped her

13:05.853 --> 13:07.387
while they were supposedly
on the job.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.156
- I don't believe
they're undercover.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.891
They're whole story
is B.S.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.026
- But...their captain did
confirm it to me.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.528
- Yeah.
Obviously he is in on it too.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.164
I mean, did he give you details,
a target?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.899
- Easy. If they really are
investigating

13:18.899 --> 13:21.068
high level corruption, it would
be on a need-to-know basis.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.735
- And that gives them
permission to rape?

13:22.735 --> 13:25.238
- This girl did seem
credible to me.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.174
- [clicks tongue]

13:27.174 --> 13:29.442
No witnesses, no outcry,
rape kit?

13:29.442 --> 13:31.078
This isn't gonna be easy.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.380
- So you just look the other way
and I have to go back to Barba

13:33.380 --> 13:34.882
and tell him
that IAB is not investigating?

13:34.882 --> 13:36.416
- Hey, I thought
we were friends.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.551
I didn't say I'm passing
on these two.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.621
I've dealt with these
two particular cops before.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.224
Last time was about a year ago.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.294
- When were you
gonna mention that?

13:47.294 --> 13:48.495
- Well, nothing stuck,

13:48.495 --> 13:51.464
and accusations against Vice
cops are a dime a dozen.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.400
But if I get them in here,
and they are part of

13:53.400 --> 13:55.903
a high-level investigation,
they will have to give that up

13:55.903 --> 13:57.604
in order to save their shields.

14:02.142 --> 14:05.612
- How many times are we gonna
dance to this same song, Tucker?

14:05.612 --> 14:08.015
- I have allegations.
I need your side.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.151
- And who exactly is making
these allegations? Hookers?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.319
- Try high school girls.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.653
- Are you talking about
the party chicks

14:13.653 --> 14:15.288
that BX9s
have been pimping out?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.457
- That's it?
Your top secret, high level,

14:17.457 --> 14:20.260
two-year target
is a street gang?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.930
- Look, they're
the low hanging fruit.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.832
The roots of this tree
we cannot discuss.

14:25.832 --> 14:28.735
- And so this investigation is
so critical that you've allowed

14:28.735 --> 14:32.805
underage girls
to be sex trafficked?

14:32.805 --> 14:35.976
- Tragic as it may be,
yeah.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.477
That's the job.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.546
- I'm not so sure it is.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.982
- You wanna quarrel
about policy?

14:41.982 --> 14:44.417
Take it up with
Detective Russo's superiors.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.519
- Phone calls are being made.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.656
Is raping 16-year-old girls
while supposedly undercover--

14:49.656 --> 14:51.358
is that also part
of that policy?

14:51.358 --> 14:54.461
- These girls aren't dumb.
We're cops, okay?

14:54.461 --> 14:56.496
We don't engage
in the sexual activity,

14:56.496 --> 14:58.065
so they make us as cops.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.199
That's why
they're coming after us.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.601
- They're not coming after you.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.971
Our witnesses
are reluctant, scared.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.738
- Of what? That their families
are gonna find out

15:05.738 --> 15:06.974
they're living the life?

15:06.974 --> 15:08.475
- That's not the case here.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.777
- Okay, so her pimp bought her
something shiny,

15:10.777 --> 15:12.812
put her up to it--
it's preemptive.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.847
They're just trying
to create reasonable doubt

15:14.847 --> 15:16.616
since SVU busted them.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.119
- Give us names.
We'll run down that angle.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.855
- You know, if One P-P
won't give you the target,

15:22.855 --> 15:24.992
maybe that should
tell you something.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.995
[dramatic music]

15:27.995 --> 15:33.133
*

15:33.133 --> 15:36.269
- Vice claims that BX9
is pimping out these girls

15:36.269 --> 15:38.005
to cops and politicians?

15:38.005 --> 15:40.007
It doesn't sound like the M.O.
for a street gang.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.841
- I'm telling you.
These guys aren't undercover.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.011
They're the muscle, or they're
running it themselves.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.712
- Either way,
they called my bluff.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.381
These two would rather risk
a morals change than name names.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.383
- So we hit another
brick wall.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.485
- Rollins, you talked to the
girls at the party again, right?

15:52.485 --> 15:54.221
- Danielle went back
to her shelter,

15:54.221 --> 15:57.090
and Natalia and Margaret's
foster families picked them up.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.225
No one is cooperating.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.227
- So what about friends,
classmates?

16:00.227 --> 16:02.129
I mean, somebody knows
how these girls got caught up.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.630
- I mean, we can ask.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.532
Natalia and Margaret
both went to St. Fabiola's.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.799
So did Cara Gutierrez.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.735
- St. Fabiola's?

16:08.735 --> 16:10.737
- It's an all-girl's parochial
high school in the South Bronx.

16:10.737 --> 16:14.107
- Yeah, I know it--I might know
somebody who works there.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.476
My cousin Eugene--he's
a psychologist and a priest.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.145
The last I heard,
he was a counselor up there.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.047
- Last you heard?
He's your cousin.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.615
- And a priest.
Our interests diverged.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.452
- Estranged Irish relatives.
How rare.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.387
- Okay.
You mind talking to him?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.289
- I can do that.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.924
- Tucker, you never told me
that your cousin was a priest.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.626
- You never asked.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.071
- Eugene?

16:45.972 --> 16:47.407
It's been a long time.

16:47.407 --> 16:51.111
- [gasps]
Eddie Tucker in a church?

16:51.111 --> 16:54.214
Is this safe? Am I gonna be
struck by lightening?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.619
Eddie, what?
Someone died?

16:59.619 --> 17:01.154
Aunt Caroline?
- No, no.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.689
Still alive.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.724
Still smokes three packs a day.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.096
I'm here on police business.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.897
SVU picked up
two of your students

17:10.897 --> 17:12.432
during a raid
on a sex party.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.167
- Yes, horrible.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.936
I pray Natalia and Margaret
will come back to school.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.171
- So you've spoken to them?

17:18.171 --> 17:19.539
- Oh, I check in every day.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.008
I even took one
of their confessions.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.244
- Did either of them mention
anything about this?

17:24.244 --> 17:25.545
How they got involved?

17:25.545 --> 17:26.713
- Come on, Eddie.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.115
Between the seal
of the confessional,

17:28.115 --> 17:29.382
and the HIPAA laws--

17:29.382 --> 17:30.783
- Eugene,
they're being trafficked.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.519
- I know.
It's the--

17:32.519 --> 17:35.288
It's the homes.
There's no parenting.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.358
- All right, without violating
any confidentiality,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.127
have you noticed
any other troubled girls?

17:40.127 --> 17:41.228
Late for school?

17:41.228 --> 17:43.263
Falling asleep in class?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.865
- Many, unfortunately.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.568
- Do you know a student
named Cara Gutierrez?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.437
- Cara?
Yes, yes.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.905
She dropped out six months ago.
Drugs.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.307
Is she caught up in this?

17:54.307 --> 17:56.143
- Well, her name came up
in the investigation.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.611
- Ugh.
Poor soul.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.713
An addict,
in foster care.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.616
These gangs--they know
who to prey on.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.617
- Which gangs?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.186
- Oh, Father Eugene.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.720
- Oh, Monsignor.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.190
Remember my cousin,
Eddie Tucker of the NYPD.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.058
- Yes, of course.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.227
Oh, I know.
[sighs]

18:14.227 --> 18:16.463
I know why you're here,
Captain Tucker,

18:16.463 --> 18:19.166
and I want you to know
that they're good girls.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.533
- Well, I'm just
trying to find out

18:20.533 --> 18:21.801
who led them astray,
Monsignor,

18:21.801 --> 18:24.804
but my cousin here,
he's hiding behind the collar.

18:24.804 --> 18:28.175
- Oh! I betray their confidence,
they're lost to me, to us.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.943
- He's right. I'm afraid we
can't talk about our students.

18:30.943 --> 18:35.047
- How about a nun by the name
of Sister Nina Kelly?

18:35.047 --> 18:36.616
She helps these girls.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.219
Maybe she's spoken
to either of you.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.687
- I know a Sister Nina.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.189
She's never worked
at the school.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.191
I believe she's still
out on medical leave.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.259
- Do you know about
the kind of work she does?

18:46.259 --> 18:48.728
- No.
And I'm concerned to hear

18:48.728 --> 18:50.630
she's been in contact
with students.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.499
- Why's that?

18:52.499 --> 18:54.367
- [sighs]

18:54.367 --> 18:58.405
Sister Nina's medical leave
is for psychiatric reasons.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.773
The Church has learned
the hard way

19:00.773 --> 19:02.942
that we need to be proactive.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.612
We cannot sanction her
being around children.

19:05.612 --> 19:10.683
*

19:10.683 --> 19:13.019
- You think detectives from Vice
are involved in trafficking,

19:13.019 --> 19:14.421
and your key witness,
the nun from the party,

19:14.421 --> 19:16.289
has mental health issues?

19:16.289 --> 19:18.525
- Or that's the word that they
put out to discredit her.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.293
- Either way, the word is out.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.461
What about the johns--
any help from them?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.630
- You mean the Judge?
The ABA?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.432
We think someone
maybe at Vice

19:25.432 --> 19:27.033
told them
that this is going away.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.268
- And they're probably right.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.437
Russo and Jefferson
stonewalled IAB.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.239
- Okay, the johns are out,
the cops are out,

19:32.239 --> 19:33.840
the nun is out.
The girls?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.509
- There is one earlier rescued
vic, Cara Gutierrez,

19:36.509 --> 19:38.144
who was talking.

19:38.144 --> 19:41.013
She alleges that the Vice cops
raped her, but...

19:41.013 --> 19:43.015
she's way too scared
to testify.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.617
- One step at a time.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.488
Find out if she's at least
willing to come and talk to me.

19:48.488 --> 19:49.956
- Cara's been in her room
all day.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.558
She didn't even come down
for supper.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.293
- Well, our D.A. wanted us
to reach out.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.161
- I really don't think
she'll be up for this.

19:55.161 --> 19:58.265
- Well, if she tells us that,
then we'll leave, all right?

19:59.266 --> 20:01.501
- Cara.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.570
Cara!

20:06.473 --> 20:09.476
[tense music]

20:09.476 --> 20:17.083
*

20:17.083 --> 20:18.418
- This is Detective
Sonny Carisi.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.520
I'm at St. Bernad--
- We don't need a bus.

20:33.400 --> 20:33.533
.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.067
- We have any idea
how Cara got this heroin?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.871
- We're asking.
But no, no idea.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.940
Sister Ida said she was
in her room all day.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.942
- This is a halfway house,
so any one of those girls

20:42.942 --> 20:44.411
could've smuggled in drugs.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.413
- So they all swore
that they didn't.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.747
- Mechanism of death--

20:47.747 --> 20:50.082
respiratory arrest
due to pulmonary edema.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.185
- And the cause?
- Acute drug intoxication.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.721
Bad heroin.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.656
- Accident or suicide?
- You tell me.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.025
When was the last time
this girl used drugs?

20:59.025 --> 21:00.760
- She's been clean
for six months.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.330
- [sighs] Sometimes addicts,
after they're sober,

21:03.330 --> 21:04.864
go back
to their old dosage.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.500
- Is it possible somebody
gave her a hot shot?

21:07.500 --> 21:08.901
- Well, I can't prove that,

21:08.901 --> 21:10.670
but if this concentration
were going around,

21:10.670 --> 21:12.339
we'd be seeing
a lot more overdoses.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.774
- So you're leaving
the manner undetermined.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.676
- Pending your investigation,
yes.

21:16.676 --> 21:20.347
And, if it helps, it's actually
a very humane death.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.981
She would've been fast asleep

21:21.981 --> 21:24.016
by the time her lungs
filled with water.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.526
- A drug overdose?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.363
No.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.166
That couldn't have been
an accident.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.506
[crying]
I never should've
brought you to Cara.

21:48.908 --> 21:52.144
They killed her.
- Okay.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.548
You keep saying,
"They," Nina.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.417
Who are they?

21:57.417 --> 21:59.251
- I told you from the beginning

21:59.251 --> 22:01.654
that all I wanted to do
was save the girls,

22:01.654 --> 22:03.623
and you gave me your word
you would protect them.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.124
- We can't do that
if you don't tell us

22:05.124 --> 22:06.759
who to protect them from.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.799
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who knew?

22:12.799 --> 22:15.402
Who knew? Who knew Cara
was at that shelter?

22:15.402 --> 22:17.069
It had to have been
somebody in your squad.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.738
- No, no, no.
That's not possible.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.040
- Yeah? Well, someone tipped
them off, and I'm next.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.811
- Listen, you're right
to be worried.

22:27.279 --> 22:30.883
That's why...we don't think
that you should stay here.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.185
- I have nowhere else to go.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.455
And they're gonna find me
anywhere I--

22:35.455 --> 22:37.256
- I know a place

22:37.256 --> 22:39.058
where you'll be safe.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.429
- Sister, now, are you sure

22:42.429 --> 22:44.964
that Cara didn't leave
the house yesterday?

22:44.964 --> 22:46.533
- Yes, I've gone over the log.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.601
She hadn't been outside
in three days.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.037
- Okay, so when was
the last time you saw her?

22:51.037 --> 22:52.605
- Midday yesterday.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.907
She was very upset.
She wouldn't leave her room.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.877
Priest even agreed to take
her confession up there.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.812
- Hang on.
She saw a priest?

22:59.812 --> 23:01.047
- Well, yes.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.950
Every Wednesday, the priest
comes to take confessions.

23:03.950 --> 23:07.754
Cara always saw him.
Went to mass on Sundays too.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.622
- Did you see her
afterward?

23:09.622 --> 23:12.625
- I left her alone
until you arrived.

23:14.461 --> 23:15.762
- Who is the priest?

23:15.762 --> 23:18.030
- Father Akintola.
He's a lovely man.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.533
West African.
He fills in sometimes.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.368
- So he wasn't your regular guy?

23:22.368 --> 23:24.937
- Usually it's Father Riley,
but he was called away yesterday

23:24.937 --> 23:26.573
by St. Fabiola's.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.609
- Okay. Where can we find
Father Akintola?

23:32.378 --> 23:36.716
- Poor Cara.
It just breaks my heart.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.384
- You took a confession.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.920
I-I know you can't tell us
what she told you, but...

23:40.920 --> 23:42.989
how did she seem to you?

23:42.989 --> 23:45.124
- She was struggling.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.926
The rest
of her former classmates

23:46.926 --> 23:49.496
just brought it all back.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.164
- You all right, Father?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.135
- I should've never
left her alone.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.337
- Did you think
she was jonesing?

23:58.337 --> 24:00.973
- I thought she was
just anxious.

24:00.973 --> 24:04.076
- Well, did she mention
any new friends, maybe,

24:04.076 --> 24:06.579
or did you see anybody
come into her room?

24:06.579 --> 24:08.715
- Not while I was there.

24:08.715 --> 24:12.652
Ugh, but, look, Sister Ida,
she has her hands full,

24:12.652 --> 24:17.223
keeping a house full of runaways
from giving into temptation.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.526
Cara was an addict.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.594
They always find a way.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.696
- Thank you, Father.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.732
- Thank you.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.400
- Oh, if you like...
[clears throat]

24:30.202 --> 24:34.574
I can talk to the girls
and...see what they know.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.544
Now that Cara is gone,
they may want to come forward.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.379
- Yeah, that--
That'd be great, Father.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.614
Thank you.

24:46.753 --> 24:49.922
- Sister Nina told us that Cara
was in a very good place

24:49.922 --> 24:51.558
and wouldn't have started
using again.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.392
- That's not what
Father Akintola told us.

24:53.392 --> 24:54.894
- Yeah, well,
I agree with Nina.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.029
Someone gave Cara
a hot shot to shut her up.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.365
- Let's hang on, all right?
I'm all for paranoia,

24:59.365 --> 25:02.168
but who else knew that she was
cooperating, besides us?

25:02.168 --> 25:06.005
- Sister Nina, Sister Ida,
Barba and...IAB.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.007
- And the Vice cops.
I mean, they had motive

25:08.007 --> 25:09.876
and NYPD computer access.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.578
- Which is why I made sure
not to put Cara's name

25:11.578 --> 25:12.679
in the system.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.981
- So no one else at IAB
knew.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.016
- I didn't even tell
my partner.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.058
- But you did ask
your cousin about her.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.495
- Son of a bitch.

25:29.495 --> 25:32.498
[tense music]

25:32.498 --> 25:37.604
*

25:37.604 --> 25:40.673
Eugene.
- Excuse me.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.974
What did you do, Eugene?

25:41.974 --> 25:44.343
What did you do?
- What are you talking about?

25:44.343 --> 25:46.245
- Cara Gutierrez,
you remember her?

25:46.245 --> 25:47.980
You said she had it rough?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.481
Well, she got it
a whole lot worse now.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.017
She's ice cold in the morgue.
- I know.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.385
I heard.
It's horrible. These drugs--

25:53.385 --> 25:55.287
- Oh, you think
it was the drugs, huh?

25:55.287 --> 25:56.522
- Well,
what else could it be?

25:56.522 --> 25:58.224
- Well, we don't know.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.392
She may have overdosed.
She may have been murdered.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.628
- Dear God.

26:01.628 --> 26:03.229
- Oh, don't give me that,
Eugene.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.396
I've locked up better liars
than you.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.298
Who did you send after Cara?
- Eddie!

26:06.298 --> 26:07.466
You're not making
any sense.

26:07.466 --> 26:08.801
- I told you
we were talking to her,

26:08.801 --> 26:10.269
and you knew what that meant.

26:10.269 --> 26:12.639
- All I know is that you are
acting like a madman.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.140
- The Vice cops--
are you on their payroll,

26:14.140 --> 26:16.843
or are they on your payroll?
- Neither!

26:16.843 --> 26:19.378
I was Cara's
guidance counselor!

26:19.378 --> 26:21.347
How could you even
contemplate something like that?

26:21.347 --> 26:22.849
- Why don't we calm down,
Father?

26:22.849 --> 26:24.516
Step over here with me
for just a second.

26:24.516 --> 26:28.955
So, question: is it possible
that you may have inadvertently

26:28.955 --> 26:30.356
let Cara's name slip?

26:30.356 --> 26:32.659
- No, I'd never make
a mistake like that.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.661
- Why was Father Riley called
away from St. Bernadine's

26:34.661 --> 26:36.028
last Wednesday?

26:36.028 --> 26:38.197
- Because I needed as many
shoulders as I could get

26:38.197 --> 26:39.866
for the girls to cry on!

26:39.866 --> 26:43.535
You can't possibly think that
this is some sort of conspiracy.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.471
- How well do you know
Father Akintola?

26:45.471 --> 26:48.174
- He is a good man.
He's a good priest.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.676
Eddie!

26:49.676 --> 26:51.811
It's the Bronx!

26:51.811 --> 26:52.979
Cara was involved
with the gangs,

26:52.979 --> 26:54.513
if she was cooperating,
they'd find out--

26:54.513 --> 26:57.684
- The only person I mentioned
Cara's name to was you!

26:57.684 --> 26:59.886
And now she's dead.

26:59.886 --> 27:02.722
- My cousin has been
at IAB too long.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.858
He thinks everybody
is corrupt.

27:05.858 --> 27:09.395
Eddie, that reflection you see
in my eyes--that's your soul!

27:09.395 --> 27:11.097
- Father--
- Not mine!

27:11.097 --> 27:13.032
It's you who turned
your back on God, not me!

27:13.032 --> 27:15.902
- Let's go, Ed.

27:15.902 --> 27:18.905
- They've got something on you.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.107
- You're unbelievable.
And you should leave now.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.208
Please.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.910
- Let's go.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.577
Let's go--Ed!

27:28.580 --> 27:31.150
- I know it was you, Eugene.
I know it was you!

27:31.150 --> 27:33.285
- Tucker, enough.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.887
I said enough!

27:34.887 --> 27:37.323
*

27:37.323 --> 27:40.326
- You better get yourself right
with that God you love so much,

27:40.326 --> 27:41.994
because I'm coming for you.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.596
He's not gonna help.
- Let's go. Now.

27:52.772 --> 27:52.905
.

27:53.740 --> 27:54.440
- That pious little snake
is lying.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.609
- He didn't kill Cara.
He was at the school all day.

27:57.609 --> 27:59.145
- But he set her up.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.580
- Or maybe he just
let her name slip.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.083
- Not a chance; Eugene wouldn't
do that--he's a politician.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.918
Every word out of his mouth
is calculated.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.320
- You really think that he's
running a sex trafficking ring?

28:08.320 --> 28:09.856
- Or protecting it.
I don't know.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.991
I want a warrant
for his phone, his financials,

28:11.991 --> 28:14.060
his computer, everything.
I'm gonna tear into his life

28:14.060 --> 28:15.895
until I find out
what he's hiding.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.096
- No, you're not, Ed.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.497
He's your cousin,
not a cop, okay?

28:18.497 --> 28:20.366
If he is a suspect--
- He's more than a suspect.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.769
- Then let SVU pursue it.

28:22.769 --> 28:25.271
Not your case.
Not your case.

28:28.574 --> 28:31.911
I will ask Barba
for the warrants.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.346
- That nun.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.882
They're gonna be
looking for her.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.384
She needs to come inside.
- She's safe.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.386
- So was Cara.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.793
- That's so cool!

28:46.793 --> 28:48.227
- Sister Nina?

28:51.430 --> 28:54.200
There you are.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.535
- I-I fed him, 'cause he seemed
a little hungry.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.504
I hope that's all right.
- Oh, of course. Yeah.

28:58.504 --> 29:02.909
Um, Sister Nina,
this is Captain Tucker.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.511
Okay. Hi, my love.

29:05.511 --> 29:08.114
Hi, what are you playing with?

29:08.114 --> 29:09.982
[kisses]

29:09.982 --> 29:11.717
- So who is he,
and why is he here?

29:11.717 --> 29:13.820
- He's all right, Nina.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.221
Captain Tucker,
and he's investigating

29:15.221 --> 29:16.622
Russo and Jefferson.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.690
- The Vice cops
who haven't been charged?

29:18.690 --> 29:20.159
- I'm working on that,
believe me.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.328
- Nina, it's okay.

29:22.328 --> 29:25.965
Captain Tucker knows that Russo
and Jefferson are dirty cops.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.499
He wants them off the force.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.969
- And in jail.
But I need your help to do that.

29:29.969 --> 29:33.906
- Look, we already know
that most of those girls

29:33.906 --> 29:36.242
were students
at St. Fabiola's.

29:36.242 --> 29:39.078
- Is there someone at the school
we should be looking at?

29:39.078 --> 29:41.513
- I don't work there.

29:41.513 --> 29:44.083
- Please.
Please.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.123
- Okay, y-you know,

29:51.123 --> 29:53.960
sometimes the guidance
counselors at these schools

29:53.960 --> 29:57.296
have their fingers on
the pulse of what's going on.

30:03.002 --> 30:06.738
- Are you saying we should be
talking to Father Eugene?

30:06.738 --> 30:09.008
- What, you know him?

30:09.008 --> 30:14.613
- Yes, we do.
Uh, Eugene is actually, uh,

30:14.613 --> 30:17.116
he's actually Tucker's cousin.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.551
- Father Eugene
is your cousin.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.291
Hey, you need any help
with that, Noah?

30:25.291 --> 30:26.859
What are you doing?

30:26.859 --> 30:29.795
- Did any of the girls say
he may be involved?

30:32.865 --> 30:34.766
No one will know
where it came from.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.768
I promise you that.
- You know what?

30:36.768 --> 30:38.537
Let's say good-bye
to Mr. Tucker.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.706
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.709
He's gotta go.
He's gotta go right now.

30:43.709 --> 30:44.911
- Nina--
- No, no, no.

30:44.911 --> 30:47.947
She's right.
It's okay.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.448
I'll go
and let you two talk.

30:49.448 --> 30:57.423
*

30:57.423 --> 30:58.490
[door closes]

30:58.490 --> 31:01.160
- Nina,

31:01.160 --> 31:03.429
I need you to put my son down.

31:05.664 --> 31:07.199
Nina, listen to me.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.668
Look, Tucker's gone.
All right?

31:09.668 --> 31:10.937
I know you wanna help
those girls,

31:10.937 --> 31:13.339
but it's not what you think.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.641
Nina, I need you
to put my son down...

31:15.641 --> 31:17.843
right now.

31:17.843 --> 31:26.518
*

31:26.518 --> 31:27.954
Thank you.

31:32.491 --> 31:35.361
Okay. Everybody wants
to hug you.

31:35.361 --> 31:40.432
Everybody wants to hug you.
Don't they, sweet Noah?

31:40.432 --> 31:42.768
Okay, baby,
how about you and me,

31:42.768 --> 31:45.404
how about we go play
with mommy's iPad, okay?

31:45.404 --> 31:46.705
Okay?

31:50.509 --> 31:51.877
I'll be right back.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.113
Come here, baby, come here.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.353
Nina.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.355
- You know, I actually thought
you were on my side?

32:03.355 --> 32:05.257
- I am on your side.
- Father Eugene's cousin?

32:05.257 --> 32:07.026
He's in charge
of the investigation?

32:07.026 --> 32:10.296
- Yes, but listen to me.
There's no love lost there.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.730
And if Eugene is involved,

32:11.730 --> 32:14.100
then Tucker and I
will go after him.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.634
- You know, everyone said
I could trust you--

32:15.634 --> 32:18.204
Sister Ida, Jen.
I should've known that you were

32:18.204 --> 32:19.771
gonna sell me out.
- I would never do that.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.173
- Are you gonna have me
committed again, huh?

32:21.173 --> 32:22.541
- No.
- Sent for more shock treatment?

32:22.541 --> 32:24.576
I am not crazy!

32:27.013 --> 32:31.717
You bring Father Eugene's
cousin here?

32:31.717 --> 32:33.852
Either you're in on this
with them,

32:33.852 --> 32:35.787
or you're an idiot.
- Nina, listen to me.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.524
Just take a breath.
Listen to me.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.359
I can't even imagine

32:40.359 --> 32:41.793
what's going through
your mind right now.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.031
But, please,
please don't leave here.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.199
It's not safe out there.
You know that.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.668
- You wanna know what's going
through my mind?

32:49.668 --> 32:52.838
I think--I think you brought me
here to kill me.

32:52.838 --> 32:56.042
- What?
- But you don't have to.

32:56.042 --> 32:59.578
Look, I don't know anything
about your trafficking ring.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.580
And I'm not talking to anyone
about it ever again.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.082
- Stop, listen--

33:03.082 --> 33:06.185
[dramatic music]

33:18.164 --> 33:18.297
.

33:19.065 --> 33:19.565
- Thank you, Monsignor.

33:20.966 --> 33:23.769
- I know I've put a heavy burden
on you, but I have faith

33:23.769 --> 33:25.637
that the D.A.'s office
will do the right thing.

33:25.637 --> 33:29.808
- Of course.
- Please, this has to end.

33:29.808 --> 33:33.145
I want to spare these girls
any more exploitation.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.680
- We all do.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.355
- Mike Dodds.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.956
- Monsignor Mulregan.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.992
Ah, nice to see you.

33:46.992 --> 33:48.694
You know Lieutenant Benson?

33:48.694 --> 33:50.629
- I've heard
only good things.

33:50.629 --> 33:54.266
I wanna thank you
for rescuing our girls.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.535
- I'm...sorry
that we lost one.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.970
- Cara Gutierrez.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.807
I was there
when she received confirmation.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.909
Such a pretty young girl.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.118
- What's the Monsignor
doing here?

34:12.118 --> 34:13.419
- I'm still trying
to figure that out.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.886
What can I do for you?

34:14.886 --> 34:17.189
- We're waiting on warrants
for Father Eugene

34:17.189 --> 34:18.957
and Father Father Akintola.
- So am I.

34:18.957 --> 34:21.560
A lot of judges are reluctant
to hand out financial

34:21.560 --> 34:24.396
and cell records of priests.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.899
A-are we--are we making
the wrong turn here?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.568
Where's IAB on Vice?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.370
- Well, Tucker's keeping
that investigation active,

34:31.370 --> 34:33.905
but we have reason to believe
that priests are involved

34:33.905 --> 34:35.607
in Cara's death.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.376
- And you're getting all this
from Sister Nina?

34:37.376 --> 34:40.946
- Sister Nina is no longer
involved in this investigation.

34:40.946 --> 34:42.414
- Why not?
[door closes]

34:42.414 --> 34:44.150
- Because when Tucker and I
spoke to her,

34:44.150 --> 34:46.452
I mentioned that he was
Father Eugene's cousin,

34:46.452 --> 34:50.156
and let's just say that she...
had a bad reaction.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.557
- Like what?
A panic attack?

34:51.557 --> 34:53.225
- No, it was much more
than that.

34:53.225 --> 34:54.526
She became...convinced

34:54.526 --> 34:56.728
that Tucker was in
on the whole thing,

34:56.728 --> 34:59.965
that we were gonna have her
committed, have her killed.

34:59.965 --> 35:04.170
I mean, she was paranoid,
and...completely shut down.

35:04.170 --> 35:07.306
- Can you blame her?
Vice and God knows who else

35:07.306 --> 35:09.275
have been trafficking these
girls to elected officials.

35:09.275 --> 35:12.678
Somebody leaked that Cara
was cooperating.

35:12.678 --> 35:16.315
Listen, who beside Tucker
knew about Cara?

35:16.315 --> 35:21.187
- My squad, you, Sister Nina,
and...Father Eugene.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.392
- Dodds, can you give us
a minute?

35:30.429 --> 35:32.030
- Sure.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.772
- You wanna tell me
what's going on?

35:40.772 --> 35:43.209
- You sure Father Eugene knew?
- Oh, yes.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.644
Tucker told him.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.946
- What do you really know
about Tucker?

35:49.781 --> 35:51.217
- We go way back,

35:51.217 --> 35:53.051
he's a straight shooter,
intense.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.720
No nonsense.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.055
- You've never known him to--
to abuse his power,

35:57.055 --> 35:58.890
overreach, or...

35:58.890 --> 36:01.227
he almost destroyed both
of your old partners.

36:01.227 --> 36:04.029
- Yes, he arrested me too,
but we're way past that.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.531
Wh--what is this about?

36:05.531 --> 36:07.233
- [sighs]

36:07.233 --> 36:10.936
Monsignor's Mulregan's visit
was not a social call.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.471
He has made
some very serious allegations.

36:12.471 --> 36:15.507
- Yeah.
Against Father Eugene.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.244
- No. Against Tucker.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.848
- Allegations against Tucker?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.952
What did the Monsignor say,
exactly?

36:26.952 --> 36:28.254
- He said that
he and Father Eugene

36:28.254 --> 36:30.622
went to Tucker
a year ago.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.358
That they had information

36:32.358 --> 36:35.160
that Vice was running
some of their students.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.996
Father Eugene even violated
the seal of the confessional

36:37.996 --> 36:39.130
to provide evidence.

36:39.130 --> 36:40.499
- He claims that?

36:40.499 --> 36:42.734
- They also named Russo
and Jefferson.

36:42.734 --> 36:43.902
And Tucker buried it.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.272
- And he's telling you
this now?

36:46.272 --> 36:49.174
This is about protecting
Father Eugene.

36:49.174 --> 36:52.344
I was there, at that church,
when Tucker confronted him.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.380
I thought he was gonna
rip his head off.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.814
- I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, maybe that's--

36:55.814 --> 36:57.015
Maybe that's what
he wanted you to think.

36:57.015 --> 36:59.385
- No, Ed is
not capable of that.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.287
- Since when?

37:01.287 --> 37:02.921
I thought SVU hated this guy.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.323
He's gone after each
and every one of you.

37:04.323 --> 37:07.058
- That's his job.
He has to be relentless.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.495
You're wrong about him.
Trust me.

37:09.495 --> 37:12.798
- Wait.

37:12.798 --> 37:15.033
Are you involved with him?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.508
- Don't ask me that.

37:22.508 --> 37:27.713
*

37:27.713 --> 37:31.116
- When were you
gonna tell me?

37:31.116 --> 37:34.520
I am informing you
that a captain at IAB

37:34.520 --> 37:36.822
may be involved in a sex
trafficking ring,

37:36.822 --> 37:38.390
and you don't mention

37:38.390 --> 37:40.792
that the two of you
are sleeping together?

37:40.792 --> 37:42.661
- You're wrong about him.

37:44.162 --> 37:48.033
Bring him in here,
ask him yourself.

37:49.701 --> 37:52.871
- You and I are done talking.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.841
[somber music]

37:55.841 --> 38:00.346
*

38:15.894 --> 38:16.895
- Thanks for coming.

38:16.895 --> 38:18.864
- Of course.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.198
- Nobody saw you, right?

38:20.198 --> 38:22.668
- Here? No.

38:27.539 --> 38:28.940
- So what have you heard?

38:28.940 --> 38:31.276
- That Group One
is investigating you

38:31.276 --> 38:34.245
for sex trafficking,
corruption, murder?

38:34.245 --> 38:36.948
- Yeah. I've been invited to
come in early tomorrow morning.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.150
- Oh, my God.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.653
- Cousin Eugene
really set me up good.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.589
- [sighs]
- You get those warrants yet?

38:43.589 --> 38:45.290
- No, they're stalled.

38:45.290 --> 38:47.593
I don't know if it was before
or after Barba found out

38:47.593 --> 38:51.597
that I was...
biased towards you.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.767
- Oh. Okay.

38:57.403 --> 39:00.906
You know how this goes.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.508
Don't stick your neck out.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.075
It'll look like
you're covering for me.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.477
Hey.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.846
They can't prove anything,

39:07.846 --> 39:10.015
because I haven't done anything.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.151
All right?
I'm gonna be fine.

39:13.151 --> 39:16.054
- And we just let
these guys skate?

39:17.889 --> 39:21.427
- You wanna go after the church,
City Hall, and Albany

39:21.427 --> 39:22.761
for an IAB investigator

39:22.761 --> 39:24.730
who's loathed
by half of NYPD?

39:26.064 --> 39:27.566
Stay out of it.

39:27.566 --> 39:30.602
[cell phone buzzes]

39:36.274 --> 39:38.444
- Well, it just
might be too late.

39:41.179 --> 39:45.050
One-P-P wants to see me.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.752
Immediately.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.797
- Whatever's going on,
Barba wouldn't talk about it

39:58.797 --> 40:00.466
in front of me.
- Did you call your dad?

40:00.466 --> 40:02.267
- Yeah. He's not
calling me back.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.269
Someone high up the chain
must be starting to sweat.

40:04.269 --> 40:07.873
- Because we're taking on
the Catholic Church.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.208
Sorry.
- No, I get it, Rollins.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.778
Look, 99% of these priests
are good guys.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.713
The Church just
brought this on themselves.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.982
At least the Monsignor came
to Barba on his own, right?

40:16.982 --> 40:18.383
That's got to be a good sign.

40:18.383 --> 40:19.818
- Yeah, they probably realized

40:19.818 --> 40:21.987
transparency's
their only salvation.

40:21.987 --> 40:24.623
- If you say so.
- Rollins, Carisi.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.925
Get me some
evidence boxes, please.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.226
Carisi:
Uh, yeah, on it.

40:28.226 --> 40:30.428
- Dodds, a minute.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.067
- Is everything all right?

40:36.067 --> 40:39.004
- Oh, I'm fine.

40:39.004 --> 40:42.107
- Lieutenant,
what's going on?

40:42.107 --> 40:45.376
- You'd know better than me.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.912
- Did something happen?

40:46.912 --> 40:48.914
- You're telling me
that you didn't know?

40:48.914 --> 40:50.181
- Know what?

40:51.617 --> 40:54.452
- That I'm out.
Effective immediately.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.522
Uh, Carisi, Rollins,
as of now,

40:56.522 --> 41:01.192
Sergeant Dodds is acting
commander of SVU, so...
