What's the ruckus?

28:43.472 --> 28:44.932
Uh, these two.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.852
- Fighting over yours truly.
- Fighting over you?

28:47.852 --> 28:49.145
I didn't realize
you hippie chicks

28:49.145 --> 28:51.105
are tired of the same
five shriveled dicks

28:51.105 --> 28:52.774
you've had
for the last 40 years.

28:52.774 --> 28:55.234
I've hit the mother lode.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.735
Well, the grandmother lode.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.736
How's Debbie doing?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.530
You laid with Moon and Harmony?

28:59.530 --> 29:00.990
Hey, give her credit.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.827
Osteoporosis doesn't
slow her down at all.

29:03.827 --> 29:05.077
- And you were right--
- Aah!

29:05.077 --> 29:06.955
Hey, easy!

29:06.955 --> 29:09.415
What about free love and all
that "Rolling Stone" crap?

29:09.415 --> 29:10.791
Frankie is mine!

29:10.791 --> 29:12.293
Oh, Queenie,
nobody belongs to anybody!

29:12.293 --> 29:14.712
- He is mine!
- All right, stop!

29:14.712 --> 29:16.255
Stop!

29:16.255 --> 29:19.758
[chicken clucks]

29:19.758 --> 29:22.761
To the Pit.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.142
Sean?

29:28.142 --> 29:30.686
[Sean]
Upstairs.

29:32.146 --> 29:34.148
[approaching footsteps]

29:35.608 --> 29:36.943
You took down the slide.

29:36.943 --> 29:37.985
Well, that wasn't a slide.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.904
It was a death-defying
free fall.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.405
Getting rid of the bar next.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.783
So, I found
Monica's wedding dress.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.744
I'm having it altered.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.538
I think it might actually
turn out really pretty.

29:49.538 --> 29:50.789
I know this sounds crazy,

29:50.789 --> 29:53.001
but I kind of want
to get married

29:53.001 --> 29:54.877
in a church.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.503
Now we're talking.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.546
[laughs softly]

29:57.546 --> 29:59.423
St. Katherine's gets you hot?

29:59.423 --> 30:01.008
If you're in nothing but that.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.426
Don't get any ideas.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.553
I'm changing for
the bachelorette party.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.472
You got more time
before you got to go.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.224
No sex before the wedding.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.226
Ah, no, I c--

30:10.226 --> 30:11.685
couldn't possibly
have heard that right.

30:11.685 --> 30:12.811
It's tradition.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.480
Yeah, so's the bride
being a virgin.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.689
Gus and I got married

30:15.689 --> 30:17.816
after a crazy,
intense sex bender.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.236
Pretty sure I didn't
need to know that part.

30:20.236 --> 30:23.239
This time's gonna be different.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.659
But, look, if you want

30:26.659 --> 30:29.996
all the wedding hoopla,
you got it.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.873
But...

30:31.873 --> 30:32.831
our marriage is gonna be

30:32.831 --> 30:35.960
different than the other one.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.837
Because it's us.

30:40.714 --> 30:43.217
Did you say all that just 'cause
you want to get laid?

30:43.217 --> 30:46.011
No.
No, but, uh...

30:46.011 --> 30:48.055
did it improve my chances?

30:48.055 --> 30:49.933
- Yes, it did.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm!

30:49.933 --> 30:51.892
You got to be--are you...

30:51.892 --> 30:54.061

- Shittin' me?

30:58.649 --> 31:00.985
[sighs]

31:03.153 --> 31:04.906
Hi, Phillip.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.282
- I'm Yvonne.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.242
Uh, look, could we, uh,
get this over with

31:08.242 --> 31:10.202
so I can go find
someplace to live?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.079
[chuckles]

31:12.079 --> 31:15.207
Um, how often
do you drink, Phillip?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.875
Is this about the other night?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.877
You violated the school's
alcohol policy.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.505
Sorry, the school has
an alcohol policy?

31:21.505 --> 31:23.507
Yeah,
and we take it seriously.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.343
Okay, you do realize
that the majority of students

31:26.343 --> 31:27.845
on this campus drink so much

31:27.845 --> 31:29.513
they could major in beer pong?

31:29.513 --> 31:31.265
We're not talking
about everyone else.

31:31.265 --> 31:33.517
There are even houses
students can join

31:33.517 --> 31:35.769
for the express purpose
of getting shitfaced.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.896
They, uh, have Greek letters
above the door.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.565
We're here to talk
about your problem.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.442
I-I don't have a problem.

31:41.442 --> 31:42.651
You were in the ER.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.778
I overdid it.

31:44.778 --> 31:47.114
Once.

31:47.114 --> 31:50.409
Look, I-I've been drinking
since I was ten.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.577
Since you were ten?

31:51.577 --> 31:52.995
Uh, why are you
writing that down?

31:52.995 --> 31:55.205
And what drove you to drink
when you were ten?

31:55.205 --> 31:56.915
- Was it problems at home?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.834
Look, I-I have midterms
to grade, okay?

31:58.834 --> 32:01.378
Okay, when a student violates
the school alcohol policy,

32:01.378 --> 32:02.755
he is required to
attend counseling,

32:02.755 --> 32:04.048
both one-on-one
and group sessions

32:04.048 --> 32:06.425
with other student
alcohol abusers.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.926
Okay, I'll check my schedule.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.846
It's mandatory.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.765
Or what?

32:12.765 --> 32:15.768
Expulsion.

32:23.026 --> 32:25.986
Aah!
My back is killing me!

32:25.986 --> 32:27.404
How much longer?

32:27.404 --> 32:31.117
Oh, only
the Mother Goddess knows.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.826
I think this was a mistake,
coming here.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.495
Oh, nonsense.

32:34.495 --> 32:36.205
Once we get this water boiling,

32:36.205 --> 32:39.000
we can sterilize the tools.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.128
Those look a little...medieval.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.379
Uh, uh, uh--never let me down.

32:43.379 --> 32:46.132
Got my cervical dilator,

32:46.132 --> 32:48.425
my forceps,

32:48.425 --> 32:51.053
- my hook.
- Your hook?

32:51.053 --> 32:53.055
In case I need
to break your water.

32:53.055 --> 32:56.184
Is there anything we can do
to speed this up?

32:56.184 --> 32:59.395
Well, sometimes
a baby comes faster

32:59.395 --> 33:01.397
when the nipples are stimulated.

33:01.397 --> 33:02.189
[knuckles crack]

33:10.156 --> 33:11.949
Hey.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.409
I need to crash here tonight.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.577
You have the midterm grades?

33:15.577 --> 33:18.122

Can I sleep here or not?

33:18.122 --> 33:19.623
No.
It's my office.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.750
Where are my midterm grades?

33:21.750 --> 33:24.086
Look, I'm sorry I didn't have
time to finish your work.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.588
I was busy getting fired,
kicked out of my room,

33:26.588 --> 33:28.382
and forced to write
a ten-page essay

33:28.382 --> 33:30.175
on the dangers of drinking.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.970
The department pays me
to teach and grade students.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.638
Yeah, well maybe they should
be paying me,

33:34.638 --> 33:36.140
since I'm the one doing it.

33:36.140 --> 33:38.267
You're two or three advanced
degrees away from that.

33:38.267 --> 33:41.562
Give me the midterms.
I'll do it myself.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.067
Did you hear
what I just went through?

33:47.067 --> 33:49.195
Heard.
Don't care.

33:49.195 --> 33:52.030
Why are you being
such a dick?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.991
Look,
we've knocked back a few.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.659
But you've forgotten
I'm your boss.

33:55.659 --> 33:59.122
I expect you to do your job.

33:59.122 --> 34:01.082
So I should thank you
for ripping me off?

34:01.082 --> 34:02.207
Excuse me?

34:02.207 --> 34:04.751
I read the paper
you got published.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.671
Nice job stealing my ideas
about complex wave functions.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.047
[snorts]
I gave you credit.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.591
Yeah, as one of your
research assistants.

34:10.591 --> 34:13.051
When I was at Yale, I wrote
half of Jesnick's theories

34:13.051 --> 34:15.012
on non-Newtonian fluids.
It benefited both of us.

34:15.012 --> 34:16.388

a shit in my mouth

34:16.388 --> 34:18.224

- It's fucking bullshit!

speaking to the one person

in the last few hours, right?

34:24.688 --> 34:26.064
