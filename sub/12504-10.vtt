WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.441
[Payson] This season on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.475 --> 00:09.210
Kaylie, you're up two pounds.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.578
Now come on, it's crunch time.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.313
I'm re-choreographing
your routine to this.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.248
Classical's not
really my thing.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.550
Your necklace? It's from Carter.
It's an heirloom.

00:16.584 --> 00:19.420
It's for Kaylie.
I took the diamonds
out of my World Series ring

00:19.453 --> 00:20.621
and had them set in this heart.

00:20.654 --> 00:24.192
I sent some songs to a producer.
He sent me a ticket to LA.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.326
I leave next week.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.062
- I had sex with someone else.
- Don't.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.198
[Kaylie]
You slept with my boyfriend?

00:30.231 --> 00:34.068
- You are a two-faced slut.
- I bought cortisone illegally.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.304
- What?
- I don't think I can make it
through Nationals without it.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.806
I think she has the right
to know where her mother is.

00:38.839 --> 00:42.443
You know where my mother is?
When I went to the bus station
she wasn't there.

00:42.476 --> 00:46.447
There they are.
Now can we please
get this show on the road?

00:57.658 --> 01:00.328
OK, gather around, ladies.

01:02.630 --> 01:07.501
[Sasha] You are about to enter
a whole different world when
you go through those doors.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.637
Everybody will want
a piece of you.

01:09.670 --> 01:13.374
Just stay focused and remember
what we came here to do.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.344
All right. Let's go.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.581
[indistinct chattering]

01:20.614 --> 01:23.517
[woman] Payson! Payson!
Payson Keeler!

01:23.551 --> 01:25.653
You beat Kelly Parker
in Boulder, can you do it again?

01:25.686 --> 01:28.522
- You're right I can.
- [Chloe] Isn't this exciting?

01:28.556 --> 01:30.291
Yeah, my whole body
feels like a heart attack.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.360
[woman] Lauren Tanner,
how are you feeling?

01:32.393 --> 01:33.394
I'm feeling great.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.129
Are these your lovely parents?

01:35.163 --> 01:36.497
Uh, yeah, that's my dad.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.531
My mom's dead.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.569
I feel terrible encouraging
Lauren to invite her mother.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.337
I had no idea
she'd blow her off.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.639
Don't worry about it, babe.
We all make mistakes.

01:45.673 --> 01:49.543
Kaylie Cruz, let's see
what's in your gym bag.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.147
Water.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.284
Uh-huh.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.651
Lip gloss.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.556
Well, now,
this looks very special.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.426
- Is there a story here?
- No.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.296
Kaylie, um...
Excuse me.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.299
Um... Can you give the press
some love? It's important.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.434
So, I can love the press,
just not a boyfriend?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.702
I know you're still
upset about Carter...

02:14.735 --> 02:18.306
I'm not upset.
It's completely over.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.177
[phone ringing]

02:23.211 --> 02:24.278
[Damon] Tumbleina.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.580
- I thought you'd be off to LA.
- Not till tonight.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.716
Thought I'd work a shift,
make some scratch.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.718
What's up, you sound bummed?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.353
It's insane here.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.721
You got your mom
and Brian there.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.955
No.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.259
Joe of course didn't pay
for Brian to come.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.561
That's the real bummer.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.597
When I got the big time,
I just thought we'd
be together, you know?

02:43.631 --> 02:44.598
I know.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.535
- [people screaming]
- But...

02:47.568 --> 02:49.637
[woman] How are you planning
to hold on to the title?

02:51.339 --> 02:54.575
Wait. Wait.
Here's Payson Keeler.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.510
And here comes Kelly Parker.

02:56.544 --> 03:00.214
This is the face-off
everybody's waiting for.

03:00.248 --> 03:04.452
Payson, you beat Kelly
for the very first time
last week in Boulder.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.588
What was the key
that unlocked the win?

03:07.621 --> 03:08.622
Being better.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.758
- [laughter]
- Kelly Parker!

03:10.791 --> 03:12.560
[man] Kelly Parker, over here.

03:12.593 --> 03:16.330
Kelly, now, we know you've
had some tendon issues.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.298
How are you feeling?

03:17.331 --> 03:19.567
Cal, you were genius
at the ESPY'S this year.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.635
But, yeah, I have
a little ankle thing.

03:21.669 --> 03:25.739
I got it when I won Nationals,
or was that Worlds?

03:25.773 --> 03:27.275
But I'm ready to go.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.377
Drugs are OK for some people,

03:29.410 --> 03:31.612
but I just would never use them.
I'd feel weak.

03:31.645 --> 03:35.316
Over here!
Mark Aslan, Narnia Chronicle.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.651
Payson, you are so beautiful,
as beautiful as Ms. Parker here,

03:37.685 --> 03:39.787
many think more beautiful.

03:39.820 --> 03:43.657
We want to know why you don't
have your own makeup line
like she does?

03:43.691 --> 03:47.528
I don't have my own makeup line
or wear miniskirts to show off
my belly button.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.597
My dad won't let me.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.702
Whoo!

04:03.311 --> 04:04.312
[man] Miss.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.715
Do you belong here?

04:08.782 --> 04:11.719
I guess we're about to find out.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.675
[man] MJ, you're widely
considered to be the expert
on talent.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.477
So, who are the girls
to look for this year?

04:36.510 --> 04:38.579
Well, of course there's Kelly
Parker and Payson Keeler,

04:38.612 --> 04:39.513
two very strong competitors.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.449
But Kristen Henneford's
floor routine

04:41.482 --> 04:42.616
has sparked quite a buzz.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.717
[man] And let's not forget

04:43.751 --> 04:44.852
about Lauren Tanner.

04:44.885 --> 04:45.853
What about Emily Kmetko?

04:45.886 --> 04:48.356
[TV shuts off]

04:49.657 --> 04:50.624
You must be Damon.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.725
And you're Brian.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.662
We have the formalities
out of the way.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.729
Aren't you supposed
to be in LA?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.731
No. I'm supposed
to be in Boston.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.833
Emily needs us...
Well, you, at Nationals.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.669
And I'm gonna make it happen.
You in?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.704
Yeah. I mean, are you kidding?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.873
But, how are we gonna get there?

05:07.375 --> 05:08.642
We're taking the bus.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.387
A friend's taking it
to Atlanta for Radiohead.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.522
We're gonna take a little
detour through Boston.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.656
In Radiohead's bus?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.726
Did I mention awesome?

05:27.861 --> 05:29.797
Whatever distractions you
experienced the last few weeks

05:29.830 --> 05:31.699
you left them all behind
in Boulder. Are we clear?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.534
[girls] Yes.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.735
All right, then.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.904
Lauren and Kaylie,
you're in room 324.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.839
Payson and Emily, 325.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.608
I'm not rooming with Lauren.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.843
- I'm a light sleeper
and she snores.
- I do not.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.612
- I'll crash with Kaylie.
- I'll stay with Kaylie.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.583
[Lauren] Don't look at me,
and don't talk to me.

05:49.617 --> 05:52.520
And don't make me look at
that painful luggage set

05:52.553 --> 05:53.487
you got from
the dollar store.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.690
I'm nervous enough.
I don't need your crap.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.392
And if you haven't noticed,

05:58.426 --> 05:59.760
you're running short
of people to talk to,

05:59.793 --> 06:01.395
much less room with.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.496
I'd have my own suite

06:02.530 --> 06:04.398
if it weren't for team rules.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.734
But no, we have to shack up
with a roomie.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.569
- Like we're all bonded now?
- Yeah, sure.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.171
Till you lie, cheat
or sleep with my boyfriend.

06:11.204 --> 06:15.643
You know, I guess the Pizza Boy
might be worth slumming it for.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.581
Can you believe her?

06:20.614 --> 06:23.684
Talking about my back like she's
putting some voodoo hex on me?

06:23.717 --> 06:26.954
Come on Pay, you're the one
that always says don't let
the competition get to you.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.756
I've never seen her
affect you like this.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.559
It's not Kelly Parker
that's getting to me.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.726
It's just...

06:32.760 --> 06:33.894
I'm sick of the injury.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.162
I'm sick of lying about it.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.697
And I hate lying about
the cortisone.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.833
I'm starting to feel...

06:39.867 --> 06:40.901
Icky.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.870
Like I'm a fraud.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.746
OK. What are you doing?

06:53.647 --> 06:55.949
Visualizing my floor routine.

06:55.983 --> 07:00.521
I still can't get used to that
prissy music Sasha gave me.

07:17.671 --> 07:21.709
And that would be
our Team Captain.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.711
[Kaylie] For so long
it was this fun thing

07:23.744 --> 07:25.913
that Dad and I shared.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.949
You know? Just the two of us.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.819
But now it's
just not fun anymore.

07:31.852 --> 07:35.022
So much has changed.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.957
He loves you,
you know that.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.759
And I love you.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.995
So does Mom.
And so does someone else.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.597
What do you know?

07:43.631 --> 07:45.866
About you and Carter? Enough.

07:45.899 --> 07:50.003
I said that I would ask, but
that it's totally up to you.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.539
Where is he?

07:59.813 --> 08:00.881
[Carter] I'm sorry.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.518
I just had to come.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.786
I have to be here for you,
Kaylie.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.622
Like you were there for me when
you slept with my best friend?

08:08.656 --> 08:12.259
Did you really think I would
never find out it was Lauren?

08:12.292 --> 08:14.628
I made a huge mistake but...

08:14.662 --> 08:17.998
You know, the worst part isn't
even that you slept with Lauren.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.600
You lied to me.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.969
And you let me confide
in her about us.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.673
And how you were this great guy
who was fine with waiting

08:25.706 --> 08:27.541
because you loved me.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.077
God, she must have
thought I was so stupid.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.914
- Then again, so did you.
- Kaylie, please.

08:33.947 --> 08:37.685
I love you so much.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.687
Please, Kay,
you have to forgive me.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.690
You need me to forgive you.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.758
My dad needs me
to be the champion.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.560
Sasha needs me to focus.

08:46.594 --> 08:49.763
Everybody is so quick to tell
me what they need me to do.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.799
But what about me, Carter?

08:51.832 --> 08:55.803
- What about what I need?
- Of course, yes, tell me.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.607
I need to be alone.

09:16.156 --> 09:20.761
[man] Welcome to the
American Gymnastics National
Championships 2009.

09:20.794 --> 09:24.131
And leading off the parade
of teams this year

09:24.164 --> 09:26.600
the Denver Elite
Gymnastics Club.

09:26.634 --> 09:30.704
Featuring the reigning
National Champion, Kelly Parker.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.606
Now entering the arena,

09:32.640 --> 09:35.876
the Great Falls Stars led
by Captain Kristen Henneford,

09:35.909 --> 09:39.079
and coached by her dad,
Kurt Henneford.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.883
Next up...

09:42.916 --> 09:45.853
The Rocky Mountain
Gymnastics Training Center.

09:45.886 --> 09:50.724
Coached by Sasha Belov,
and captained by Emily Kmetko.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.794
Let's go, Kaylie!

09:55.863 --> 09:58.131
[woman] Today is the first day
of two days of competition.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.735
Both day's scores
will factor into the
All Around Competition.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.704
[man] By tomorrow
afternoon, we will know

10:03.737 --> 10:07.074
who has made this year's
National Gymnastics Team.

10:14.214 --> 10:17.885
I want you to forget
everything that's come
before this moment.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.187
Forget everything
that is to follow.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.389
You are the few,

10:22.422 --> 10:27.094
who have earned the right to
be at this place at this time.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.764
You know, there was a time
in each of your lives

10:30.798 --> 10:32.733
when you sought to be inspired.

10:32.766 --> 10:37.070
Today, you will inspire others.

10:37.104 --> 10:40.073
There was a time
when you dreamed dreams.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.209
Today you will live them.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.978
So, what do you say we
get this party started?

10:48.015 --> 10:50.818
- One, two, three...
- [all] Rock on.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.953
[man] First up for The Rock,
Emily Kmetko.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.422
It's hard to believe,
but at this time last year

10:55.455 --> 11:00.828
Emily Kmetko was training at
the YWCA in Fresno, California.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.830
First big-time meet.
That's a lot of pressure.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.232
Does she even have a shot
at making the National Team?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.701
[woman]
Realistically? Probably not.

11:07.735 --> 11:11.805
It's going to be all she can do
to keep her nerves in check.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.146
That's OK. No worries.
We'll get the next one.

11:19.179 --> 11:23.116
[man] Up for The Rock on beam,
Lauren Tanner.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.890
Lauren Tanner finished tenth
at last year's Nationals.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.925
A lot of people are expecting
her to medal this year.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.727
[woman]
She certainly has a shot.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.829
The judges are going
to be looking for a lot
more personality

11:35.863 --> 11:38.098
than she's showing
them right now.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.802
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.170
- She looks...
- Angry.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.772
It's my fault.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.840
I let her get her hopes
up about her mother.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.742
Hey, you didn't know.

11:48.776 --> 11:49.877
You did.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.745
I should have listened to you.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.115
Where you going?

11:55.148 --> 11:58.752
[man] Kelly Parker on bars,
Payson Keeler on deck.

11:58.786 --> 12:01.188
Is there anyone who can
seriously challenge

12:01.221 --> 12:03.824
either of them for
this year's National title?

12:03.857 --> 12:05.092
[woman] Honestly? No.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.295
I mean, I just don't see anyone
ready to step up to their level.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.899
So, I hear your back is hurting.

12:11.932 --> 12:16.069
I hear you're the new cover girl
for hemorrhoid cream. Congrats.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.104
Good luck.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.806
You, too.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.299
[Sasha] Yes!

12:46.333 --> 12:48.568
[woman] An outstanding
routine from Payson Keeler.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.338
That should be good enough
to put her in first place.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.107
[man] Still early, though.
Anything can happen.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.976
Shelby, North Carolina.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.311
A listing for Leslie Tanner?

12:58.345 --> 13:01.248
[man] Next up on the beam
for The Rock, Kaylie Cruz.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.287
[Alex] Let's go, Kaylie.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.089
This is what we've
been working for, baby.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.357
Bring us home the gold.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.359
Bring us home the gold!

13:17.965 --> 13:20.233
[woman] Now, Kaylie Cruz
is always a crowd favorite.

13:20.267 --> 13:23.871
She is one of those athletes
that know how to entertain
an audience.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.138
[man] Is that
gonna be enough?

13:25.172 --> 13:28.308
[woman] Well, you know, Kaylie
has kind of plateaued this year.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.845
If she ever dug deep enough
to get the grit to match her
glitz,

13:31.879 --> 13:33.981
she could surprise
a lot of people.

13:34.014 --> 13:34.814
[Summer] Do you have

13:34.848 --> 13:37.150
any idea how much you've
hurt Lauren?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.919
It is one thing
to disappoint her,

13:38.952 --> 13:40.187
but to raise her hopes
like you did?

13:40.220 --> 13:44.624
I mean, why did you even tell
her that you were going to...

13:44.657 --> 13:45.893
What?

13:47.627 --> 13:49.096
No, he didn't.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.433
I didn't...

13:55.035 --> 13:57.104
I didn't know that.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.643
[man] Now, here's the dismount.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.645
Payson's final skill of the day.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.414
[woman] Will her lead hold?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.883
[crowd cheering]

14:27.200 --> 14:29.937
[applause]

14:34.707 --> 14:36.944
[man] A fantastic routine
by Kelly Parker.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.380
[woman] Ooh, that will
probably knock Payson
Keeler out of the top spot.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.282
[man] There's the score...

14:42.315 --> 14:46.153
Yes, Kelly Parker will be the
leader at the end of day one.

14:46.186 --> 14:50.690
[woman] The last athlete of the
day for The Rock, Emily Kmetko.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.092
[classical music plays]

14:53.260 --> 14:54.461
[man] This
is a new routine
for Kmetko.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.429
Her coach, Sasha Belov,

14:56.463 --> 14:58.465
changed the music
on her just a week ago.

14:58.498 --> 15:02.002
[woman] And, in all honesty,
she still doesn't look
comfortable with it.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.971
[applause]

15:04.004 --> 15:07.340
[man] A disappointing day
all around for The Rock.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.675
How bad was it?

15:08.708 --> 15:10.944
Not great.
You barely made twentieth.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.280
You've got a lot of
catching up to do tomorrow.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.949
But you can do it.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.351
And so, at the conclusion
of day one,

15:18.385 --> 15:22.722
National Champ Kelly Parker
maintains a narrow lead
over Payson Keeler.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.493
And with another day of
competition there's still
time for plenty of surprises.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.996
Who will make this year's
National Team?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.472
What are you doing?

15:39.506 --> 15:41.708
I'm leaving.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.244
I thought it was Lauren
who wouldn't let me in.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.512
But it's you.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.414
What are you talking about?

15:48.415 --> 15:50.250
I used to admire you.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.519
I found your devotion
to Lauren rare.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.255
Your struggle as a
single parent commendable.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.324
But I guess that
attraction blinded me.

15:57.357 --> 16:01.094
Because what I thought
was a beautiful, loving
father-daughter relationship

16:01.128 --> 16:02.996
is actually something unhealthy.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.331
Wait. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.466
Where is all this coming from?

16:06.499 --> 16:10.537
You told Leslie not to come.
You threatened her not to come.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.205
That's not exactly true.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.773
Lauren was so excited to see her

16:13.806 --> 16:16.176
and you scared her off.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.314
Where do we go from here?

16:21.348 --> 16:23.283
I go out that door.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.318
You? You can go to...

16:34.194 --> 16:36.463
[Kaylie] I am so not
in the mood for this.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.766
[Lauren] If I see any of these
judges here I might slit their
throats.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.168
How could I not win on beam?

16:41.201 --> 16:43.303
How could Kelly Parker
be beating me?

16:43.336 --> 16:45.305
How long do we have to do this?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.440
Let's get this over with
so we get back to focusing

16:47.474 --> 16:49.442
so we can get back
into the game tomorrow.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.477
Don't let her
get to you, Pay.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.145
Don't let her get to any of us.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.580
[Kelly] Nice Jaeger
on bars today, Payson.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.582
But I saw you wince.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.584
I mean you could take
another shot of cortisone.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.120
But it taints the victory,
don't you think?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.322
Excuse me.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.191
- Well, that was easy.
- [Lauren] Yeah.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.592
You're an expert on easy,
aren't you?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.327
Really?
'Cause I thought you were.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.430
At least according to
Kaylie's boyfriend.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.465
Excuse me.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.235
Yet, he still chose her. Owie.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.108
Whoops.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.376
[Alex] It's OK.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.412
Calm down. Don't let
the pressure get to you.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.548
You don't have to win the gold
tomorrow, or any medal at all.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.217
Gee, thanks, Dad.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.153
I'm talking to you as your
agent here, not your father.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.487
With your looks
and personality,

17:34.521 --> 17:37.124
that's all you need for
the big endorsement money.

17:37.157 --> 17:40.093
So, the goal is
to do well enough.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.629
- Not to win?
- Of course I want you to win,

17:42.662 --> 17:45.098
but we have to think
realistically here.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.633
OK? It's my job
to protect your future.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.136
And isn't it a good thing that
I got you covered financially,

17:49.169 --> 17:50.537
- in case something...
- Yeah.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.273
Thanks, agent. Good thinking.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.143
There she is.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.377
Where's Summer?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.246
[chuckles] Really?

17:59.279 --> 18:01.614
You want Summer here?
That's a switch.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.650
Where is she?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.420
Summer's not here.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.655
She left.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.524
We're going through
a little bump.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.460
She left?

18:13.493 --> 18:14.661
She left us?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.529
I thought that's
what you wanted.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.331
Just the two of us again.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.600
Yeah.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.571
OK.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.344
Is it officially
Crap On Kaylie Cruz Day?

18:31.378 --> 18:34.614
Oh, is your princess shine
wearing off?

18:34.647 --> 18:36.149
Mmm... Don't start, Lauren.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.551
OK. The BS ends, now.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.253
Right here.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.688
We are tanking in there

18:41.721 --> 18:44.191
because we're all acting
like petty little bitches.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.325
So, stop it.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.161
Team Rock is crumbling.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.696
Sad. But what can you expect?

18:49.729 --> 18:51.898
I mean, look at you.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.901
Keeler over here is hurt,
and a liar.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.703
Kaylie can't hold on
to her own boyfriend.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.305
And Lauren's a tramp.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.407
I mean, who else
does that leave?

19:00.440 --> 19:01.608
Oh, right.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.710
Your Captain,
who's in twentieth.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.512
Who won't ever make
the National Team.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.946
And nobody even knows
who she is.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.748
[horn honking]

19:13.620 --> 19:17.290
Can I get a whoop, whoop
for Emily Kmetko?

19:17.324 --> 19:18.925
[all] Whoop, whoop!

19:18.958 --> 19:20.427
[Brian] I can't hear you guys!

19:20.460 --> 19:21.728
Can I get a whoop, whoop

19:21.761 --> 19:23.730
for Emily Kmetko?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.732
[all] Whoop, whoop!

19:31.671 --> 19:34.674
Brian!
What are you doing here?

19:34.707 --> 19:36.276
Hi, baby!

19:36.309 --> 19:37.577
Hi!

19:37.610 --> 19:39.246
I can't believe you're here!

19:39.279 --> 19:41.381
Come on, come on!
I'll show you everything.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.649
[Chloe] It's so neat.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.319
Hi.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.656
Come on.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.496
Talk to me.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.500
It's my big chance
and now that I'm here...

20:01.568 --> 20:03.370
I'm in over my head.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.373
- Choking.
- You got this in the bag.

20:06.406 --> 20:10.643
Every time I approach an
apparatus I close my eyes
and I see the same thing.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.279
What do you see?

20:15.282 --> 20:16.249
It's the landing.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.988
On every landing I see
myself flat on my back.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.724
The crowd boos and I can't move.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.426
Because you're hurt?

20:26.459 --> 20:27.827
Because I'm ashamed.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.399
Turn around.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.439
We're gonna try this again.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.709
From the beginning.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.714
Where are you?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.784
- I'm on the bars.
- OK.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.554
Imagine you're a cobra.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.756
You strike the bars
like a cobra. Bam!

20:56.789 --> 20:58.691
Strong and sure.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.430
And then there you go.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.565
Now you're flying.
You're sailing through it.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.667
No gravity. Tension perfect.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.835
Like a hawk.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.338
Light. Strong.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.806
Can you see it?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.611
What does it look like?

21:22.349 --> 21:25.352
I'm out of body, spinning.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.322
It's like I'm hollow.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.857
It's so fast.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.627
I land the high bar.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.729
What does it feel like?

21:36.763 --> 21:39.566
Infinite.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.635
- Like a cloud on jet fuel.
- And?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.705
I swing around...

21:45.738 --> 21:46.806
- ...about to release.
- And?

21:48.808 --> 21:50.543
I do a full-in, propelling.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.611
And you hit the mat,

21:51.644 --> 21:52.612
on your feet,

21:52.645 --> 21:54.747
ramrod straight.

21:54.781 --> 21:57.584
A huge smile on your face
because you did it.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.752
All right. The audience,
applauding and cheering.

21:59.786 --> 22:04.357
You nailed it, you deserve it.
You deserve it as much as any
other girl here.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.527
- I nail it?
- Nailed it. Bang!

22:14.667 --> 22:15.768
Bang.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.442
I can't believe you
came this far for me.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.446
What can I say?

22:26.479 --> 22:27.780
I'm a groupie.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.525
[Kaylie] If I don't kill it
tomorrow I won't medal.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.393
At least you'll make
the National Team.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.695
I have to be perfect tomorrow.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.597
And even then I might
not make the team.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.467
Are you gonna take
the cortisone?

22:47.500 --> 22:49.702
- I haven't decided yet.
- [door opens]

22:51.904 --> 22:53.540
[Payson] Where have you been?

22:53.573 --> 22:55.675
Guess whose?

22:58.711 --> 23:01.448
I got that little dweeb at the
front desk to slip me her key.

23:01.481 --> 23:04.817
Then I waited till she and
her little devil worshipers
left for dinner.

23:04.851 --> 23:07.854
[smacks lips] So?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.590
We have like, five minutes
to lights out.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.727
Then we better hurry up.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.863
- Let's go!
- Come on you two.

23:22.702 --> 23:23.703
Ladies.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.705
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.643
Might you tell me
where you're off to...

23:30.677 --> 23:33.546
...in your pajamas?

23:33.580 --> 23:36.983
We're going to the gift shop
for magazines.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.585
And toiletries.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.987
Toiletries?

23:41.020 --> 23:42.622
Tampons.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.823
I swear...

23:43.856 --> 23:47.026
...as Team Captain, I will
have us all back by lights out.

23:48.495 --> 23:49.496
OK.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.534
One more thing.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.802
What's in the bag?

23:56.969 --> 23:59.572
Kelly Parker's head.

24:00.707 --> 24:01.508
Carry on.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.644
- Nice work, Captain.
- [giggling]

24:07.847 --> 24:09.649
[knock at door]

24:11.751 --> 24:13.686
Kaylie. Good morning.
What can I do for you?

24:13.720 --> 24:15.221
I want to talk to you
about representation.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.757
I thought your father
represented you?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.826
He doesn't take me seriously.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.661
He doesn't think I'm a champion.

24:22.695 --> 24:23.863
I'd have to agree.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.899
Look, Kaylie,
I'm not trying to be unkind.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.935
But gold medals
aren't made of gold.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.939
They're made of unmitigated
desire, determination
and the will to win.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.574
And I just don't
see that in you.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.577
Well, you're wrong.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.512
I'm not who you think I am.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.814
When you look in the mirror
what do you see?

24:41.848 --> 24:43.950
What do you mean?

24:43.983 --> 24:46.018
Do you see a pretty
16-year-old girl

24:46.052 --> 24:48.688
with lots of options
and distractions?

24:48.721 --> 24:49.622
Or do you see a champion?

24:49.656 --> 24:52.525
And when you ask yourself,
"What do I want?"

24:52.559 --> 24:53.826
Do you think,
"I want a boyfriend,

24:53.860 --> 24:56.763
some new clothes, a day off?"

24:56.796 --> 24:59.632
Or do you think,
"I want to win?"

24:59.666 --> 25:01.801
Because those are
the only two answers:

25:01.834 --> 25:03.069
Who am I? I'm a champion.

25:03.102 --> 25:06.773
What do I want? I want to win.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.941
So who are you, Kaylie Cruz?

25:08.975 --> 25:10.977
And what do you want?

25:14.046 --> 25:16.048
Kelly Parker,
current National Champion.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.050
Let's see what's in
your gym bag?

25:20.920 --> 25:23.055

Is this on the JumboTron?

25:39.772 --> 25:41.808
[Kelly] Who put these in here?

25:45.745 --> 25:48.080
So, this is what losers do
instead of practice.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.650
Hope it pays off.

25:52.819 --> 25:53.786
[crowd cheering]

25:53.820 --> 25:55.755
Remember now, you're close.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.590
Just keep your routines clean,

25:57.624 --> 26:01.027
stay focused, and you'll walk
out of here with the gold. OK?

26:05.698 --> 26:08.000
Technically, Lauren, you're
the best you've ever been.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.002
But can you find
some joy in that?

26:10.036 --> 26:11.671
Let the judges see it.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.840
If you'll just give them
permission to love you,

26:13.873 --> 26:16.809
they'll find a place
for you on that podium.

26:19.011 --> 26:22.148
You do realize no one expects
you to do anything, right?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.618
- Great pep talk.
- No.

26:25.652 --> 26:27.854
It's a wonderful place to be.
Total freedom.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.923
I want you to make this
your playground.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.091
Think you can do that?

26:32.992 --> 26:34.160
Yeah.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.035
More.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.804
More strength.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.172
More desire.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.940
More will. More effort.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.943

But I gotta be
my own person now.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.293
By the way, MJ?

29:21.327 --> 29:23.529
I know who I am...

29:23.562 --> 29:26.032
...and I know what I want.

An incredible vault
by The Rock's Kaylie Cruz,

29:44.250 --> 29:46.352
scoring a 16.2.

29:46.385 --> 29:50.256
That's the highest score
awarded so far at Nationals.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.895
Here's Lauren Tanner.

29:55.928 --> 29:59.365
Can she break the top five
by the end of the day?

Another solid vault
for Lauren Tanner.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.858

- Lauren.

the easiest person to be around,

And yes, that will
be the highest score
of the day on beam.

A terrible thing.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.419
Uh, did you see her moving?

34:13.452 --> 34:15.521
[woman] No. I hate
to say this, but I didn't.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.459

well retain her title.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.495
Ironically, it's Payson's
roommate, Kaylie Cruz,

34:23.529 --> 34:25.231
who is within striking distance

34:25.264 --> 34:27.533

34:35.574 --> 34:39.511
We are all upset here.
We are all very upset.

34:39.545 --> 34:40.912
But Payson
wouldn't want you...

34:40.946 --> 34:44.483
She wouldn't want any
of you to jeopardize
your performance today.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.419
So we all need to be
focused here and professional.

34:47.453 --> 34:49.455
We need to do this.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.257

Her old music.

- I don't think I can do that.
- I know you can do it.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.894
Emily, the only reason
you're behind these others

35:28.927 --> 35:31.530
is they have been brought to
serious gyms their entire lives.

life to your gymnastics.

...may never walk again.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.844
I'm so sorry, honey.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.447
- [Payson] Oh, my God.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.382
No. [crying]

38:03.415 --> 38:05.751
Oh, my God.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.455

Kaylie Cruz,
who is showing us all

38:11.723 --> 38:14.460

some thought she was.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.529
And National Champ Kelly Parker.

38:17.563 --> 38:18.664

Now that Payson's gone,
it's all mine.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.402
You weren't going to beat
my friend Payson.

38:23.435 --> 38:24.803
And guess what?
Today,

38:24.836 --> 38:27.339

athletes of the day.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.449

tabulating the scores.

39:58.196 --> 39:59.164
[woman] Holy cow!

39:59.197 --> 40:00.432
