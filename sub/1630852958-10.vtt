WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:03.792
Previously, on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

00:03.792 --> 00:07.083
Ah! Mother----er!

00:07.083 --> 00:08.626
Pull the slack that you've
got from your left hand.

00:08.626 --> 00:10.209
I am pulling!

00:10.209 --> 00:11.667
You're not, there's slack
here, pull.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.667
Gary is obviously in
a ton of pain,

00:14.667 --> 00:19.167
unhappy with the situation.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.042
Now you're being sarcastic,
which is a ----ing idiot,

00:21.042 --> 00:22.584
so, you'd better stop it.

00:22.584 --> 00:23.709
No, I'm not being an idiot.
I'm just like...

00:23.709 --> 00:25.125
Yeah, you know what [bleep] off.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.459
I'm disappointed
in some of my behavior.

00:26.459 --> 00:29.417
I want to start fresh.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.250
Ugh. Good chat.

00:31.250 --> 00:34.584
I seriously wanna crawl into
a hole and ----ing disappear.

00:34.584 --> 00:39.125
Make me cry.

00:39.125 --> 00:42.626
The competitiveness with Ashley,
it's about being number one.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.083
Do you know if Glenn's
found somebody yet?

00:45.083 --> 00:47.083
I believe Glenn said
after this charter,

00:47.083 --> 00:48.792
so he'll probably come
tomorrow or the next day.

00:48.792 --> 00:51.000
I've secured a local villa
for you guys to use...

00:51.000 --> 00:52.375
Oh, a real day off!

00:52.375 --> 00:55.167
And have some much-deserved
down time.

00:55.167 --> 00:57.792
With the rocks that we've had
with personality differences,

00:57.792 --> 01:00.083
I feel like I've lost
some of your trust.

01:00.083 --> 01:01.459
-I want you here.
-Yeah.

01:01.459 --> 01:03.292
But you have to want to be here.

01:03.292 --> 01:26.167
I'm just so burned out.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.417
We're gonna start the bunny pad,

01:27.417 --> 01:36.375
and then start
covering up cushions.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.125
I feel so defeated.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.792
Everything's working
on the clock.

01:40.792 --> 01:43.125
It's the interpersonal parts
of this job

01:43.125 --> 01:47.584
that don't seem to be
working on this boat,

01:47.584 --> 01:49.542
and I don't know how
to make it work.

01:49.542 --> 01:55.584
[sniffles]

01:55.584 --> 01:57.042
Is that us all good,
squared away?

01:57.042 --> 01:58.375
Yep, tender's done,
cushions done.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.125
Okay, perfect.

02:00.125 --> 02:02.167
-Everything looks pretty good.
-We're done, right?

02:02.167 --> 02:03.626
-Finished.
-Good job, girls, thank you.

02:03.626 --> 02:05.167
You're welcome.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.125
All crew, all crew,
there will be water taxi

02:07.125 --> 02:09.375
waiting to take you guys to
the restaurant later tonight,

02:09.375 --> 02:11.125
but you'll come back by taxi.

02:11.125 --> 02:12.167
Okay, copy.

02:12.167 --> 02:19.125
Oh, my feet smell so bad.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.751
Oh, I'm so thirsty.

02:21.751 --> 02:24.125
You look beautiful tonight.

02:24.125 --> 02:26.375
Yo, look at those pants!

02:26.375 --> 02:34.584
Come away from me.

02:34.584 --> 02:42.292
No, yeah.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.542
We need to give her
a second chance.

02:44.542 --> 02:53.667
And she needs to give
you a second chance.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.501
I'm willing to,
I just have to...

02:55.501 --> 02:59.667
like, it's not
gonna be overnight.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.250
I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna try.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.626
I feel like I haven't
eaten much today,

03:04.626 --> 03:08.542
so I'm gonna get drunk fast.

03:08.542 --> 03:11.209
Are we going on the boat?

03:11.209 --> 03:15.584
-Hi, Sam.
-Hi, Sam, I'm Gary.

03:15.584 --> 03:18.042
-Well, cheers, guys.
-Cheers!

03:18.042 --> 03:19.626
To another exciting evening
off the PIII.

03:19.626 --> 03:21.250
Woo!

03:21.250 --> 03:26.167
And Daisy, your ass looks
good in those pants.

03:26.167 --> 03:29.125
I have realized it's easier
to flirt with Gary

03:29.125 --> 03:31.125
than it is to fight him,
so I will keep on

03:31.125 --> 03:34.042
this flirting train so
I can get what I want.

03:34.042 --> 03:36.584
I agree.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.584
Water.

03:38.584 --> 03:40.417
-Salud!
-Salud!

03:40.417 --> 03:42.375
I'm so excited for tomorrow.

03:42.375 --> 03:44.083
-Perfect day.
-Yeah.

03:44.083 --> 03:45.584
I'm gonna rip tequila
shots all day.

03:45.584 --> 03:47.250
-Yeah, same.
-Guys, are you ready?

03:47.250 --> 03:48.626
We're very ready.

03:48.626 --> 03:50.083
The mussels.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.584
[speaking Spanish]

03:52.584 --> 03:55.209
-Can I get the aubergine?
-La caldera?

03:55.209 --> 03:57.542
-Si.
-I'm so excited by our tip.

03:57.542 --> 04:00.167
The tip is 20,000.

04:00.167 --> 04:01.667
-Oh!
-What?

04:01.667 --> 04:04.501
Let's spend our money,
let's spend our money!

04:04.501 --> 04:06.167
[cackles]

04:06.167 --> 04:09.626
That's the evilest laugh
I've heard you do.

04:09.626 --> 04:13.584
I'm just kidding.

04:13.584 --> 04:15.417
Please just have sex with him.

04:15.417 --> 04:18.042
-Should we all just have sex?
-No, I'm celibate.

04:18.042 --> 04:20.042
You are not celibate.

04:20.042 --> 04:22.751
No one's hot enough for you,
Kelsie, that's the problem.

04:22.751 --> 04:27.083
Kelsie's up here;
everyone else is down here.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.792
I'll come with you, actually,
I have to go break a seal.

04:29.792 --> 04:32.083
This is, like,
the universal potty break.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.667
I know how to clear a table.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.459
[laughing]

04:35.459 --> 04:40.209
-So, how's everything?
-Everything's good.

04:40.209 --> 04:44.751
Maybe half of it's me in
my own head...

04:44.751 --> 04:46.501
Can I speak openly with you?

04:46.501 --> 04:48.792
I really would hope you can.

04:48.792 --> 04:53.334
-Happy Gabs is ----ing amazing.
-Thank you.

04:53.334 --> 04:56.292
And you're hilarious and
everyone vibes with you.

04:56.292 --> 05:00.292
-And then sometimes we get...
-Hyper-sensitive Gaby.

05:00.292 --> 05:01.375
-And...
-It's true.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.209
I don't know how else to say it.

05:03.209 --> 05:05.667
I'm going through it right now.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.375
It's a difficult situation
with Gaby,

05:07.375 --> 05:09.250
because it only takes
a few people

05:09.250 --> 05:12.250
not getting along so well, and
then the whole crew can feel it,

05:12.250 --> 05:13.667
and it's not a good vibe.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.667
Honestly, working on a
super yacht

05:15.667 --> 05:19.125
is challenging enough as it is,
so I can sympathize with her.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.626
It's been a heavy couple
of weeks for me,

05:21.626 --> 05:23.125
so I'm just trying
to reel it in right now

05:23.125 --> 05:24.584
and get to know you guys.

05:24.584 --> 05:26.292
I do appreciate you taking
the time to talk to me.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.667
To Gabriela!

05:27.667 --> 05:29.792
-Yay, yay, yay!
-[bleep]'s sake, Daisy!

05:29.792 --> 05:33.083
To new beginnings, fresh starts.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.584
That sh-- looks good.

05:35.584 --> 05:38.250
Ooh, amazing, gracias.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.292
Do you think Glenn's in
the hot tub by himself

05:40.292 --> 05:50.042
right now, just having
a ball of a time?

05:50.042 --> 05:52.501
Wow, that looks delicious,
can I have some on my plate?

05:52.501 --> 05:54.334
I'll give you
a bite if you're nice.

05:54.334 --> 06:00.334
I'm always nice.

06:00.334 --> 06:01.667
No one look at me.

06:01.667 --> 06:04.834
Are you...

06:04.834 --> 06:08.501
What are we cheersing to?

06:08.501 --> 06:11.375
[shouting]

06:11.375 --> 06:13.167
Vamanos, vamanos.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.584
Wait, wait, wait, I'm not ready,
I need to drink more.

06:14.584 --> 06:17.375
All right, Kelsie.

06:17.375 --> 06:22.334
Let's go, bitches!

06:22.334 --> 06:25.417
I'm gonna remember
this tomorrow, guys, oh!

06:25.417 --> 06:27.042
I'm so jealous.

06:27.042 --> 06:28.459
-Are we all gonna...
-I'll take your beer.

06:28.459 --> 06:30.125
Okay, guys, should we have
a threesome here?

06:30.125 --> 06:32.375
Oh, Ashley, your bum's
sticking in my face.

06:32.375 --> 06:35.959
[chattering]

06:35.959 --> 06:37.626
Kelsie and I can kiss,
and then Gary...

06:37.626 --> 06:39.292
Okay, you two kiss.

06:39.292 --> 06:41.083
No, no, no, that's a sh-- kiss.

06:41.083 --> 06:42.792
Gary, you smell like cigarettes,
so I don't like you.

06:42.792 --> 06:43.792
I don't smell like cigarettes
I've been drinking...

06:43.792 --> 06:44.792
Yes, you do.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.125
All right, vamos.

06:46.125 --> 06:47.501
Have a good night.

06:47.501 --> 06:48.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:48.959 --> 06:50.626
What's the big deal?
No big deal!

06:50.626 --> 06:54.876
The giggle kids need
to have a meeting.

06:54.876 --> 06:56.459
I'm gonna go to bed, though,
because I am...

06:56.459 --> 06:58.042
I can't.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.626
I'm getting in the Jacuzzi.

06:59.626 --> 07:02.584
Going in the hot tub!
Kelsie, let's go in the hot tub.

07:02.584 --> 07:04.167
-Nope, I'm gonna go to bed.
-Yes!

07:04.167 --> 07:05.792
I'm tired.

07:05.792 --> 07:08.834
I'm not coming to
----ing snuggle with you, Gary,

07:08.834 --> 07:12.459
I just wanna sit in
the Jacuzzi by myself.

07:12.459 --> 07:19.375
Maybe I'll go to sleep.

07:19.375 --> 07:21.167
I can't.

07:21.167 --> 07:24.417
Like, it's out of control,
how desperate she is.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.209
It's a game for her.

07:26.209 --> 07:28.334
She said that with her own
mouth to me, in those words.

07:28.334 --> 07:29.834
Are you seeing what
I'm seeing right now?

07:29.834 --> 07:37.250
Yeah, I don't wanna see it,
I'm over it.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.083
I'm also, like...

07:39.083 --> 07:41.751
I don't have no place
to ----ing say anything,

07:41.751 --> 07:44.083
because I've been out
of control as [bleep].

07:44.083 --> 07:46.584
Okay, kiss me.
No, don't kiss me.

07:46.584 --> 07:48.167
I hate you.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.667
It's, like, so weird.
Like, it's Gary.

07:49.667 --> 07:53.667
-Yeah.
-Like, not that he's...

07:53.667 --> 07:55.584
I don't mean it how it sounds,
but at the same time,

07:55.584 --> 07:57.417
it's, like, what
the [bleep] is going on?

07:57.417 --> 08:00.375
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

08:00.375 --> 08:04.792
Is she on... Oh, she's
straddling him, Jesus Christ.

08:04.792 --> 08:06.334
They're making out now.

08:06.334 --> 08:07.751
I don't think...
I don't think that...

08:07.751 --> 08:09.167
They're making out,
they just made out.

08:09.167 --> 08:10.209
I don't think...
that's fine.

08:10.209 --> 08:12.167
Like, I don't give a [bleep]...

08:12.167 --> 08:13.667
What the [bleep] is happening?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.375
It's honestly ridiculous.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.792
It's mind-boggling.

08:16.792 --> 08:19.542
It's seriously like he has
this magic wand,

08:19.542 --> 08:21.667
and he can cast a spell
on these girls.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.584
He might actually accidentally
sleep with every girl

08:24.584 --> 08:27.334
on this boat,
without even really trying.

08:27.334 --> 08:30.334
This sh-- is out of control.

08:30.334 --> 08:36.501
-We can go downstairs.
-Okay.

08:36.501 --> 08:39.417
There's naked people
in the salon.

08:39.417 --> 08:41.292
-Oh sh--!
-See?

08:41.292 --> 09:05.125
Gary's gonna regret this in
the morning, 100 percent.

09:05.125 --> 09:08.792
Gary, you've been a bad boy.

09:08.792 --> 09:10.501
[bleep]

09:10.501 --> 09:32.167
You've been a bad boy.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.792
-No, no!
-Gary!

09:33.792 --> 09:36.042
What the [bleep]
are you ----ing...

09:36.042 --> 09:37.792
Oh, dude!

09:37.792 --> 09:39.792
It's wet undies! Ah!

09:39.792 --> 09:41.250
[laughing]

09:41.250 --> 09:42.834
Get out!

09:42.834 --> 09:44.542
I'll be back in,
like, 20 minutes.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.375
-I don't believe you.
-I'll be back later.

09:46.375 --> 09:49.751
You're not gonna come back.
Shut the door.

09:49.751 --> 10:00.167
----ing...

10:00.167 --> 10:09.042
She was ready, like,
ha ha ha, mm, hmm, hmm.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.125
I went downstairs to, like,
give him a back massage.

10:12.125 --> 10:15.167
That was the intention,

10:15.167 --> 10:17.667
and other things
might have happened,

10:17.667 --> 10:20.709
but I don't wanna get into
the details of it all.

10:20.709 --> 10:26.584
Oh, my God, Gary, what are you
getting yourself into here?

10:26.584 --> 10:40.334
[belches]
Excuse me.

10:40.334 --> 10:44.375
Oh, my God, are you okay?

10:44.375 --> 10:47.292
Are you still drunk?

10:47.292 --> 10:50.125
Oh, my God!

10:50.125 --> 10:53.250
No, you're not fine.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.626
Stop, you're not fine,
you just fainted.

10:55.626 --> 10:57.042
I'm a little...

10:57.042 --> 10:58.375
Stay the [bleep] down,
just please,

10:58.375 --> 11:01.125
do me a favor, stay down.
Just stay down.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.042
Don't... just stay down.

11:03.042 --> 11:07.292
Kelsie... Kelsie.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.459
Okay, okay.

11:08.459 --> 11:13.667
Just take your time.

11:13.667 --> 11:17.667
Dear Lord, when you're
dehydrated and lacking sleep,

11:17.667 --> 11:19.667
alcohol does bite
you in the ass.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.751
It's okay, just stay there,
just don't move.

11:22.751 --> 11:24.334
No, I'm fine.

11:24.334 --> 11:27.334
I'm never drinking again.

11:27.334 --> 11:31.334
I know, it was dark.

11:31.334 --> 11:32.792
No, I'm eating my birth control.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.792
-Good, you probably need it.
-[bleep]

11:34.792 --> 11:38.542
[laughing]

11:38.542 --> 11:39.626
Mm-hmm.

11:39.626 --> 11:41.501
Oh, my God.

11:41.501 --> 11:50.459
I'm so bothered that I even
gave him any type of attention.

11:50.459 --> 11:56.250
Oops.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.417
I don't even remember getting
back to the boat last night.

11:58.417 --> 12:01.584
Ashley.
Ashley, come here quickly.

12:01.584 --> 12:03.292
What happened last night?

12:03.292 --> 12:04.792
I don't even remember
getting back to the boat.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.584
Were you that drunk?

12:06.584 --> 12:10.292
I came straight back to bed when
I got back to the boat, right?

12:10.292 --> 12:11.459
[laughing]

12:11.459 --> 12:13.667
Oh sh--.
Do you remember anything?

12:13.667 --> 12:19.250
You don't remember when
she took you downstairs?

12:19.250 --> 12:20.542
[bleep] no.

12:20.542 --> 12:21.834
I remember her giving
me a massage,

12:21.834 --> 12:23.334
and I thought
we fell asleep there.

12:23.334 --> 12:24.459
Because I feel like you're
just like,

12:24.459 --> 12:25.709
"I don't remember," you know?

12:25.709 --> 12:27.375
I hate this,
I'm not drinking again.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.709
I'm never drinking again.

12:28.709 --> 12:32.083
Oh, Gary.

12:32.083 --> 12:33.792
-How you guys doing?
-Good.

12:33.792 --> 12:36.042
Did you have fun last night?

12:36.042 --> 12:39.751
You guys look like...
you look like you had fun.

12:39.751 --> 12:41.626
I might wear
my Miami bathing suit.

12:41.626 --> 12:44.375
Yeah, you wanna go
full Miami today?

12:44.375 --> 12:46.459
We're leaving at 12:00, guys.

12:46.459 --> 12:48.083
We're gonna go have some
tequilas now, come on.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.167
-Gary, no.
-Can you make me a mimosa?

12:50.167 --> 12:52.459
You can make me
a Bloody Mary, though.

12:52.459 --> 12:55.250
Oh, my word,
you said it, you make it.

12:55.250 --> 13:05.626
Don't forget to pack
your dinner outfit.

13:05.626 --> 13:07.709
Should we go outside?

13:07.709 --> 13:09.542
Because I don't know what
happened last night.

13:09.542 --> 13:11.626
God, this rash is weird.

13:11.626 --> 13:16.209
Well, I have Neosporin and
Vaseline and coconut oil.

13:16.209 --> 13:20.167
Coconut oil's also
a very good lube.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.501
I remember kind of
getting a massage,

13:21.501 --> 13:22.792
and then I thought we
fell asleep there.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.334
-We didn't fall asleep.
-And then...

13:24.334 --> 13:25.792
We didn't fall asleep,
but we...

13:25.792 --> 13:27.792
Yeah, I think we stopped,
because...

13:27.792 --> 13:29.709
Well, because...

13:29.709 --> 13:31.167
Yeah, yeah, that was, like...
that's what I remember saying.

13:31.167 --> 13:33.000
Okay, well, that's...
oh, really?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.292
-Yeah, I don't know...
-Okay, well, that's good.

13:34.292 --> 13:35.501
-I think we agreed on that.
-Okay.

13:35.501 --> 13:36.501
And then I think that
was that.

13:36.501 --> 13:37.584
If this is gonna happen again,

13:37.584 --> 13:39.083
let's try not to be that drunk,

13:39.083 --> 13:40.375
-because I wanna be able to...
-Yeah.

13:40.375 --> 13:41.501
-Remember it and enjoy it.
-Yeah, me, too.

13:41.501 --> 13:43.709
High-five for sex, yay.

13:43.709 --> 13:45.584
-Morning, Cap.
-Morning.

13:45.584 --> 13:47.459
You guys excited about
your big day off?

13:47.459 --> 13:49.083
-I can't wait.
-So excited!

13:49.083 --> 13:50.542
Are you gonna come to the pool
with us today?

13:50.542 --> 13:53.375
I got some stuff
I wanna do here, so...

13:53.375 --> 13:54.501
-He's like, "Nah."
-Yeah.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.834
Oh, wow, okay.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.501
Okay, so that, then I
need a belt, don't I?

13:59.501 --> 14:04.709
Oh, hot mama.

14:04.709 --> 14:07.209
Time to go, guys.

14:07.209 --> 14:09.375
You guys look like
a bunch of rock stars, eh?

14:09.375 --> 14:11.375
-Yeah!
-Bye, Glenn!

14:11.375 --> 14:12.375
Thanks for our day off, Glenn.

14:12.375 --> 14:13.751
My pleasure.

14:13.751 --> 14:15.417
-Okay, you guys, have fun.
-Thank you!

14:15.417 --> 14:16.542
Bye, Glenn!

14:16.542 --> 14:19.209
I need a drink imminently.

14:19.209 --> 14:21.292
Oh [bleep] is it gonna be
the three of us again?

14:21.292 --> 14:22.792
Oh, repeat!

14:22.792 --> 14:28.167
This is where the magic happens.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.667
Me, too!

14:29.667 --> 14:31.375
-It's gonna be epic?
-I've got a feeling.

14:31.375 --> 14:32.792
[bleep] we deserve it.

14:32.792 --> 14:35.459
Every charter's gone
really ----ing good.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.042
We ran aground, but...

14:37.042 --> 14:38.375
Oh, right, forgot about that.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.375
-No.
-----ing excited!

14:40.375 --> 14:41.834
Are you ready to party?

14:41.834 --> 14:44.209
[gulping]

14:44.209 --> 14:45.667
We're here!

14:45.667 --> 14:48.792
Ooh, here we go.
Villa time!

14:48.792 --> 14:54.876
Look at the views of this place.

14:54.876 --> 14:59.709
-Me first!
-Ah, this is so cool!

14:59.709 --> 15:01.167
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah!

15:01.167 --> 15:02.167
Yeah, baby!

15:02.167 --> 15:03.876
Oh, it is beautiful.

15:03.876 --> 15:06.292
Marcos, there's a barbeque,
you can cook for us now.

15:06.292 --> 15:08.167
Yay.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.751
Oh, my gosh, this is exactly
what I ----ing need.

15:10.751 --> 15:13.417
My plan today is just to
be my own hype man,

15:13.417 --> 15:16.584
let my hair down,
and not get in my head.

15:16.584 --> 15:18.417
I'm at such a low.

15:18.417 --> 15:25.167
This really couldn't have
come at a better time.

15:25.167 --> 15:33.167
Who wants some tequila shots?

15:33.167 --> 15:35.459
-Whoa!
-Woo!

15:35.459 --> 15:43.167
Coming up...

15:43.167 --> 15:45.292
Oh, that's enough.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.209
I don't have the patience
to deal with Gaby.

15:47.209 --> 15:47.209
-I'm done.
-Say what you wanna say.

15:47.209 --> 16:07.709
-No, no!
-Gary!

16:07.709 --> 16:09.375
Today, Gabriela,
go with Marcos.

16:09.375 --> 16:10.709
You go with Colin.

16:10.709 --> 16:13.542
Uh-oh, the claws are
about to come out.

16:13.542 --> 16:14.584
Even though they
might kill each other,

16:14.584 --> 16:15.709
I just wanna have a good time.

16:15.709 --> 16:22.209
Ready? Go!

16:22.209 --> 16:25.876
Yes!

16:25.876 --> 16:29.792
They need to work it out.

16:29.792 --> 16:34.459
Oh!

16:34.459 --> 16:43.792
-Oh!
-That was funny.

16:43.792 --> 16:51.751
[laughing]

16:51.751 --> 16:53.292
I was trying to give him...

16:53.292 --> 16:54.375
Yeah, that's what I
was gonna say!

16:54.375 --> 16:56.542
Did you?

16:56.542 --> 16:58.792
Oh, wow!

16:58.792 --> 17:05.000
We didn't speak about...

17:05.000 --> 17:06.959
Yes, thank you, Jesus!

17:06.959 --> 17:10.375
I don't understand how you could
have no recollection whatsoever.

17:10.375 --> 17:17.834
Like, normally, everybody's
just ----ing obsessed with me.

17:17.834 --> 17:21.584
You've been in the marina...
um...

17:21.584 --> 17:30.626
I used to live there
for a year.

17:30.626 --> 17:32.792
Nothing, Marcos.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.584
It's hot, dude, we
can't just sit out here

17:34.584 --> 17:35.709
and ----ing get smashed today.

17:35.709 --> 17:38.918
You think it's hot?

17:38.918 --> 17:40.626
In Venezuela, where I'm from.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.334
-No, no, I was there...
-Where I from.

17:43.334 --> 17:46.667
I say...
I don't say that anymore...

17:46.667 --> 17:47.959
In Miami, where I from?

17:47.959 --> 17:49.584
-Yeah, so...
-Where I from?

17:49.584 --> 17:51.667
The heat, you can make
a ----ing egg

17:51.667 --> 17:53.501
on the ----ing street, brother.

17:53.501 --> 17:56.375
-That's true.
-I knew it.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.584
I know people like
Gabriela in the past.

17:58.584 --> 18:01.709
For me, it's getting flashback
of my ex-girlfriend poking me,

18:01.709 --> 18:03.709
poking me, and
I used to just snap.

18:03.709 --> 18:05.792
After the year,
learning the hard way,

18:05.792 --> 18:08.626
I just realized
it's useless to react.

18:08.626 --> 18:10.959
It's better to avoid it.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.626
Get my bottle of wine.
Get my bottle of wine.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.417
You get your bottle of wine.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.792
No, I'm gonna get it,
I was gonna get it anyway.

18:16.792 --> 18:19.542
Ah.

18:19.542 --> 18:24.542
Yeah.

18:24.542 --> 18:28.209
It's enough.

18:28.209 --> 18:43.209
For me, it's disrespectful.

18:43.209 --> 18:47.501
Oh, God.

18:47.501 --> 18:53.918
-Sorry, I don't mean to laugh.
-Who would wanna have...

18:53.918 --> 18:57.375
You know what I mean?

18:57.375 --> 18:58.584
I gave him an
actual back massage.

18:58.584 --> 19:00.417
With her vagina.

19:00.417 --> 19:03.959
-Oils and everything.
-That's how it starts.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.792
Yeah, but I don't remember
when he flipped over.

19:05.792 --> 19:13.417
I don't remember when the
massage ended and the sex began.

19:13.417 --> 19:16.626
Daisy got a fat ass, no one
ever said that sh-- before.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.667
Oh, my God.

19:18.667 --> 19:23.792
Yes!

19:23.792 --> 19:30.584
[squeals]

19:30.584 --> 19:35.250
Who are you calling a tramp?

19:35.250 --> 19:36.542
I got you, I got you!

19:36.542 --> 19:41.667
Help!

19:41.667 --> 19:46.918
-----ing...
-Marcos, quick!

19:46.918 --> 19:51.375
[laughing]

19:51.375 --> 19:54.501
Oh, no!

19:54.501 --> 19:58.959
Uh-oh!

19:58.959 --> 20:05.542
Marcos!

20:05.542 --> 20:07.667
-Whoa!
-Ah!

20:07.667 --> 20:16.834
Asshole.

20:16.834 --> 20:20.209
You guys are so
----ing annoying.

20:20.209 --> 20:21.959
All right, well, I'm definitely
never getting married,

20:21.959 --> 20:23.751
because if you're 40
and still acting like

20:23.751 --> 20:27.250
a ----ing stupid-ass dickhead,
I'm definitely not...

20:27.250 --> 20:28.709
-Whoa.
-Ooh!

20:28.709 --> 20:34.459
-Too far, too far!
-Listen.

20:34.459 --> 20:35.918
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-I'm gonna embarrass myself?

20:35.918 --> 20:41.709
Gabriela.

20:41.709 --> 20:45.250
Stop it, Marcos.
Stop it.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.501
No, just stop.

20:47.501 --> 20:49.167
I didn't say nothing.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.375
I haven't been picking up
on you at all today.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.542
Okay.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.709
When I'm joking around with you,

20:52.709 --> 20:53.959
if you think I'm picking on you,

20:53.959 --> 20:57.959
then that's your
problem, not mine.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.626
Just be aware what you say.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.334
Okay, I'll be aware,
but you don't have to...

21:02.334 --> 21:04.918
You have, like, 10 people on
your side, so you're good.

21:04.918 --> 21:06.459
Maybe I'm the lucky one.

21:06.459 --> 21:07.959
Go ahead, continue to
say what you wanna say.

21:07.959 --> 21:09.959
I don't have the
patience to deal with

21:09.959 --> 21:11.834
Gaby or this kind of behavior.

21:11.834 --> 21:14.375
I'm done.

21:14.375 --> 21:14.375
Ugh...

21:14.375 --> 21:19.959
Today, Gabriela,
go with Marcos.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.751
If you're 40 and still acting
like a ----ing

21:22.751 --> 21:24.751
stupid-ass dickhead,
I'm definitely not--

21:24.751 --> 21:28.709
Whoa. Gabriela.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.959
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-I'm gonna embarrass myself?

21:30.959 --> 21:32.626
That's the best thing
you [bleep].

21:32.626 --> 21:34.584
Yeah, I know, Marcos,
you ----ing weirdo.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.876
Someone call me a cab.

21:36.876 --> 21:38.584
No one gets me,
no one understands me.

21:38.584 --> 21:40.751
I'm just a real-ass bitch,

21:40.751 --> 21:45.584
and right now, my feelings
are genuinely hurt.

21:45.584 --> 21:47.501
What? Don't...
I'm not doing this right now.

21:47.501 --> 21:58.918
I'm here to get ice...

21:58.918 --> 22:03.584
Get him up, Colin,
this is ridiculous.

22:03.584 --> 22:07.667
He slept too much.

22:07.667 --> 22:10.792
Yes!

22:10.792 --> 22:28.459
Come on, buddy.

22:28.459 --> 22:31.542
Hmm.

22:31.542 --> 22:38.459
You think I was too rude,
what I say, you know?

22:38.459 --> 22:42.792
Gabriela?

22:42.792 --> 22:51.959
I just checked on Gabriela,
she's asleep.

22:51.959 --> 22:53.918
which isn't right, either.

22:53.918 --> 22:57.167
Whatever she's dealing with,
she don't have to disrespect me.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.667
To me or to anybody.

23:00.667 --> 23:02.000
I don't want
negativity around me.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.167
I lived too many years
in a dark space.

23:05.167 --> 23:07.042
Honestly, I've never
had this before.

23:07.042 --> 23:09.626
This is a huge learning
curve for me.

23:09.626 --> 23:11.959
I think I'm just constantly
trying to keep the vibe up,

23:11.959 --> 23:14.417
but you can tell that
people aren't happy.

23:14.417 --> 23:16.125
It's just frustrating
with all of them.

23:16.125 --> 23:19.042
She snap on me again,
I will just walk away.

23:19.042 --> 23:21.959
[snoring]

23:21.959 --> 23:24.959
Yeah, well, I didn't sleep well
at all last night.

23:24.959 --> 23:26.792
Sometimes I get insomnia.

23:26.792 --> 23:29.959
I think it's the dreams about
donkeys, buying donkeys.

23:29.959 --> 23:31.000
I don't know why.

23:31.000 --> 23:48.876
[laughing]

23:48.876 --> 23:50.459
I have both.

23:50.459 --> 23:53.000
Just let me go first.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.125
[laughing]

23:55.125 --> 23:59.042
Yeah, here we go, boy, come on.

23:59.042 --> 24:02.584
Ha, ha, that's funny.

24:02.584 --> 24:03.959
Hi, my name is Gaby.

24:03.959 --> 24:08.000
This one time I
went to Menorca...

24:08.000 --> 24:09.417
You smell like cigarettes.

24:09.417 --> 24:11.042
How, I've just showered?

24:11.042 --> 24:13.876
Oh, wow, look what
the cat dragged in.

24:13.876 --> 24:15.584
I'm gonna go sit outside now.

24:15.584 --> 24:20.209
Good nap?

24:20.209 --> 24:21.959
Okay.

24:21.959 --> 24:24.751
Is this a one-way thing, or...

24:24.751 --> 24:26.834
Just don't do it, and
yeah, I'm not gonna do it.

24:26.834 --> 24:29.876
It's both. Okay?

24:29.876 --> 24:35.876
Thank you for saying
that, Marcos. Thank you.

24:35.876 --> 24:37.876
I smell something cooking.

24:37.876 --> 24:38.876
Let's go over
in the corner there.

24:38.876 --> 24:40.709
Let's go get ----ed up.

24:40.709 --> 24:42.459
Do you want someone else
to sit here this night?

24:42.459 --> 24:44.083
I feel like we always
sit across from each other.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.417
Yeah, we can change,
yeah, just to change, just to...

24:47.417 --> 24:49.876
All right, I... okay.

24:49.876 --> 24:52.459
Fine, Marcos.

24:52.459 --> 24:54.083
Paella yes!

24:54.083 --> 24:55.792
Paella!

24:55.792 --> 24:57.584
-Thank you!
-Enjoy, guys.

24:57.584 --> 25:05.959
Gracias, chicos.

25:05.959 --> 25:07.542
Me first.

25:07.542 --> 25:10.584
Go ahead.

25:10.584 --> 25:11.667
Yeah. That's a lot, Gary!

25:11.667 --> 25:12.751
You'll eat it.

25:12.751 --> 25:14.792
-Oh, my.
-[bleep].

25:14.792 --> 25:16.918
Oh, this paella's quite tasty.

25:16.918 --> 25:18.918
What a day off,
guys, oh, my Lord.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.918
Best day off I've ever had.

25:20.918 --> 25:23.584
Well, I'm so happy you guys
came to my home today.

25:23.584 --> 25:25.667
I just really wanted
to gather you all together

25:25.667 --> 25:27.834
and say one thing.

25:27.834 --> 25:29.584
I wish this was my home.

25:29.584 --> 25:31.417
Excuse me, I was giving
a speech at my home.

25:31.417 --> 25:32.959
Sorry.

25:32.959 --> 25:35.792
Thank you for coming, Marcos.

25:35.792 --> 25:40.167
-Sorry, I wasn't here.
-I know, so I said your name.

25:40.167 --> 25:43.876
Thank you for contaminating my
pool that I have to drain now.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.876
I come out of my nap, like,
in a whole new person,

25:46.876 --> 25:50.000
like dah, dah, dah,
and everyone's, like...

25:50.000 --> 25:52.167
It's like, you
pissed one person off,

25:52.167 --> 25:53.959
you have five people mad at you.

25:53.959 --> 25:56.250
Like, let's move on.
The fight was, like, hours ago.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.792
-Daisy, I have a headache now.
-Do you?

25:58.792 --> 25:59.792
I think it's time
for some games.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.083
[gurgles]

26:02.083 --> 26:04.250
That was the hottest
gurgle I've ever seen.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.667
That was the funniest things
you've ever done.

26:05.667 --> 26:07.542
I can ----ing Riverdance.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.167
Come, Daisy, you show us
how to Riverdance.

26:09.167 --> 26:10.542
You want me to show you
how to Irish dance?

26:10.542 --> 26:11.918
-Yeah!
-[bleep] yeah!

26:11.918 --> 26:16.584
[humming]

26:16.584 --> 26:20.584
[cheering]

26:20.584 --> 26:23.709
-Hey!
-Hey!

26:23.709 --> 26:25.417
Whoa!

26:25.417 --> 26:26.792
[shouting]

26:26.792 --> 26:28.083
----ing hell!

26:28.083 --> 26:29.584
Why didn't you do that
as your talent?

26:29.584 --> 26:31.417
That was ----ing amazing,
thank you.

26:31.417 --> 26:33.918
Anyways, so thank you guys
again for coming to my home.

26:33.918 --> 26:36.083
I would like you
all to leave now.

26:36.083 --> 26:39.751
What the [bleep].

26:39.751 --> 26:42.501
Right, on that note,
come on, let's go.

26:42.501 --> 26:45.167
-It is time to vamanos.
-All right.

26:45.167 --> 26:48.751
-Come on.
-Everybody, let's go.

26:48.751 --> 26:53.584
Go in that one,
bring Gabby in here.

26:53.584 --> 26:58.083
[bleep] me.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.959
Am I alone here
in thinking that?

26:59.959 --> 27:05.792
It was lovely until Marcos and
Gabriela had their fight.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.501
-Oh, yeah.
-She was the problem.

27:07.501 --> 27:08.501
I'm not doing anything.
I'm done.

27:08.501 --> 27:09.876
I've done my thing.

27:09.876 --> 27:10.959
This is someone
else's problem, I can't.

27:10.959 --> 27:12.584
-No, it's not.
-No.

27:12.584 --> 27:14.167
-She's your department.
-She's your crew.

27:14.167 --> 27:16.542
Daisy, I think you should speak
to her tonight about it.

27:16.542 --> 27:17.834
No.

27:17.834 --> 27:19.167
[bleep] yeah,
because it's fresh now.

27:19.167 --> 27:22.042
-Hundred percent, yeah.
-You're insane.

27:22.042 --> 27:24.042
If you wait till tomorrow,
then everything's blown over.

27:24.042 --> 27:25.834
It's terrible advice,
but I agree with this,

27:25.834 --> 27:27.167
just for the
entertainment value.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.042
I'm not ----ing talking to her,

27:29.042 --> 27:30.792
you're ----ing crazy if you
think I'm talking to her.

27:30.792 --> 27:31.918
No, but I think tomorrow
you could talk to her.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.542
You have to talk
to her about it.

27:33.542 --> 27:35.083
[bleep] this sh--.
Why is this my ----ing problem?

27:35.083 --> 27:36.751
Because she's your crew,

27:36.751 --> 27:37.792
and this is what you do
as the head of department.

27:37.792 --> 27:39.667
-No, but this is...
-Colin--

27:39.667 --> 27:40.959
And when it's affecting you
and affecting other people,

27:40.959 --> 27:42.751
then there's a problem
about it.

27:42.751 --> 27:44.501
-It's affecting many of us.
-You know what I mean?

27:44.501 --> 27:46.167
She's obviously very sad
and sensitive and vulnerable.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.083
Yes, she's in my department,
but we're all a crew.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.584
I don't know, I don't know
what to do, I don't know.

27:50.584 --> 27:50.584
Ugh [bleep].

27:50.584 --> 27:59.167
If you're 40 and still acting
like a ----ing

27:59.167 --> 28:00.876
Everyone, we start work
at 10:00 tomorrow.

28:00.876 --> 28:02.292
Sure.

28:02.292 --> 28:04.125
Wow, remember that one
time we lived on a boat?

28:04.125 --> 28:07.792
Okay, guys, well, that was
a lovely day off, thank you.

28:07.792 --> 28:08.959
Should we go upstairs, or...

28:08.959 --> 28:11.292
I don't know where
everyone is.

28:11.292 --> 28:24.167
Whatever. Okay.

28:24.167 --> 28:28.125
I thought I'd try to be nice.

28:28.125 --> 28:33.667
What, you just ----ing
clotheslined me.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.042
Well, I'm glad we got
one good day out of her.

28:36.042 --> 28:37.918
Her and I are not gonna
be friends outside of this,

28:37.918 --> 28:41.792
so I just really, like, I
don't give a [bleep] about her.

28:41.792 --> 28:43.709
Three more weeks.

28:43.709 --> 28:46.375
Shh.

28:46.375 --> 28:47.959
Hello.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.626
Oh, my God,
I thought you were Gary.

28:49.626 --> 28:51.167
[laughing]

28:51.167 --> 28:53.292
You're starting to look
like your partner.

28:53.292 --> 29:00.375
Oh!

29:00.375 --> 29:03.125
I like wearing
sunglasses at night.

29:03.125 --> 29:04.959
Did I interrupt a
serious conversation?

29:04.959 --> 29:06.918
No, no, we're just... no.

29:06.918 --> 29:08.918
-We just sat down.
-Not at all, we just sat down.

29:08.918 --> 29:10.292
Okay, good.

29:10.292 --> 29:12.751
Colin, can you go get me
and Ashley a beer, please?

29:12.751 --> 29:15.417
-Ugh.
-I'm okay.

29:15.417 --> 29:16.959
Everyone's gone to bed.

29:16.959 --> 29:24.083
-Do you wanna...
-Do you wanna drink alone?

29:24.083 --> 29:39.751
Bye.

29:39.751 --> 29:42.417
All right, boys,
turnover day tomorrow.

29:42.417 --> 29:48.959
Good night.

29:48.959 --> 29:54.209
[alarm sounding]

29:54.209 --> 30:11.000
Hm?

30:11.000 --> 30:17.167
-Oh, thank God.
-Yeah.

30:17.167 --> 30:23.042
Buongiorno.

30:23.042 --> 30:25.792
-Where is Gabriela?
-Morning.

30:25.792 --> 30:27.209
Morning.

30:27.209 --> 30:28.292
Are we having a meeting?

30:28.292 --> 30:32.083
Oh.

30:32.083 --> 30:33.209
How's it going?

30:33.209 --> 30:34.751
Nice day off, thank you so much.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.334
My pleasure, I'm glad
you enjoyed it.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.042
What do you wanna do for...
yeah.

30:38.042 --> 30:39.667
We'll try to finish the beds

30:39.667 --> 30:41.250
and then vacuum the stairs
in the hall again.

30:41.250 --> 30:42.876
-Okay, cool.
-Yeah.

30:42.876 --> 30:44.167
Let's do this waterline.

30:44.167 --> 30:46.167
-Okay, do that first?
-Yeah.

30:46.167 --> 30:48.334
Okay.

30:48.334 --> 30:50.167
What's the plan?

30:50.167 --> 30:52.167
The reality is it's affecting
everyone on our nights off,

30:52.167 --> 30:53.792
and at the end of the day,

30:53.792 --> 30:55.959
I can't have my chef
and my stew not talking.

30:55.959 --> 30:58.792
It's just gonna get worse
and worse and worse.

30:58.792 --> 31:00.959
I am massively affected today

31:00.959 --> 31:03.375
by the talk that I need
to have with Gabriela.

31:03.375 --> 31:07.834
What's happened is
just so complicated.

31:07.834 --> 31:10.417
Yeah, I need to handle this
delicately.

31:10.417 --> 31:12.375
And I do feel awful,

31:12.375 --> 31:15.000
because when she wants
to be in a good mood,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.834
she's great to be around.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.751
And this one little thing
with Marcos,

31:18.751 --> 31:27.083
it does undo all the progress
I made on the night before.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.918
He doesn't like me, and he
doesn't have to, it's fine.

31:29.918 --> 31:38.209
I just don't feel
like I'm gonna win.

31:38.209 --> 31:42.250
Okay.

31:42.250 --> 31:45.334
Not gonna force it out of you.

31:45.334 --> 31:46.792
-Oh, morning, Daisy.
-Morning.

31:46.792 --> 31:48.834
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

31:48.834 --> 31:50.876
-Did you have fun at the villa?
-It was great.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.083
Yeah, it was beautiful.

31:52.083 --> 31:53.959
But yeah, I need
to talk to you.

31:53.959 --> 31:55.667
Oh, really?

31:55.667 --> 31:56.918
There were a few crew problems.

31:56.918 --> 31:58.709
Okay.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.876
I think it's starting
to affect everyone's

32:00.876 --> 32:03.083
time on board, but yeah.

32:03.083 --> 32:05.209
If you need me to get involved,
I'll get involved.

32:05.209 --> 32:06.626
No, for sure,
just so you're aware.

32:06.626 --> 32:08.083
But I'm gonna take care of it.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.792
-Good.
-Thanks, Glenn.

32:10.792 --> 32:12.792
[sighs]

32:12.792 --> 32:15.959
We need to install this belt
to get this door working again,

32:15.959 --> 32:17.334
so I can bend this...

32:17.334 --> 32:18.417
Oh, we have to still
bend that more?

32:18.417 --> 32:22.834
-Just a tiny bit.
-Okay.

32:22.834 --> 32:25.626
Okay, so we'll go in front,
like so...

32:25.626 --> 32:26.918
Yeah.

32:26.918 --> 32:27.959
Okay, see if you can
feed it in there.

32:27.959 --> 32:29.167
It's good, is it on the pulley?

32:29.167 --> 32:30.209
Yeah, the gear, the pulley.

32:30.209 --> 32:32.000
That's looking real good.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Yeah, papi, yeah, papi
[bleep] yeah, nice one.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.209
Daisy, Gary, and Marcos,
can you guys meet me

32:37.209 --> 32:38.876
in the crew mess for

32:38.876 --> 32:40.584
a preference sheet
meeting, please?

32:40.584 --> 32:44.042
Copy.

32:44.042 --> 32:45.792
----ing delicious.

32:45.792 --> 32:49.125
All right, so, charter number
six, Dr. Kim Nichols

32:49.125 --> 32:51.959
is a cosmetic dermatologist.

32:51.959 --> 32:54.375
Dr. Nichols has also
requested for the yacht crew

32:54.375 --> 32:57.876
to always address her
as "Dr. Nichols."

32:57.876 --> 33:01.792
Okay.

33:01.792 --> 33:04.167
Joining Dr. Kim Nichols
is her husband, Chris.

33:04.167 --> 33:07.125
Donna, Dino, Pedro, and
Adriana are looking forward

33:07.125 --> 33:09.375
to delicious drinks and
getting to see

33:09.375 --> 33:11.626
all the action of
the crew sailing.

33:11.626 --> 33:16.375
Night one, the guests would
like the chef to present...

33:16.375 --> 33:20.209
based on their
preference sh--, sh--, sh--.

33:20.209 --> 33:24.667
Just do each course is
from a different country.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.250
Cool. All right.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.834
-Thank you.
-Lovely.

33:27.834 --> 33:30.918
Why does the boat look
so dirty, Jesus Christ.

33:30.918 --> 33:32.876
Kelsie, do you wanna
have some lunch?

33:32.876 --> 33:35.000
Oh, absolutely.

33:35.000 --> 33:42.209
Anybody else want
a grilled cheese?

33:42.209 --> 33:47.292
[sighs]

33:47.292 --> 33:49.375
-Hey, Cooks.
-Hey.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.876
I am not doing well, bitch,
I am not doing well.

33:52.876 --> 33:55.042
Just, you know, trying to
get along with the crew.

33:55.042 --> 33:56.667
Some of us are just...

33:56.667 --> 34:05.876
are not vibing,
and I feel left out.

34:05.876 --> 34:08.042
Yesterday, we got
----ing wasted.

34:08.042 --> 34:09.792
The whole day was going fine,

34:09.792 --> 34:11.375
and then me and Chef got
into an argument

34:11.375 --> 34:14.000
and I hit below the belt.
I got really mean.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.792
Yeah.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.125
I don't know why it's
upsetting me so much.

34:17.125 --> 34:19.959
Like, I'm more disappointed
just in myself.

34:19.959 --> 34:22.375
I'm 33 years old, I feel
like a child right now.

34:22.375 --> 34:24.959
I'm sorry, I'm, like...

34:24.959 --> 34:26.959
Just ----ing...

34:26.959 --> 34:30.250
Just ----ing mortified.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.083
I'm so embarrassed.

34:32.083 --> 34:34.250
I feel really ----ing
like, weak.

34:34.250 --> 34:43.375
Yeah.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.334
Yeah.

34:46.334 --> 34:48.918
[sobbing]

34:48.918 --> 34:48.918
I'm not...
I'm not happy.

34:48.918 --> 34:59.334
Everyone, we start work
at 10:00 tomorrow.

34:59.334 --> 35:01.834
I'm sure everyone's worried.

35:01.834 --> 35:04.292
Like, we never know when
Gaby's gonna snap,

35:04.292 --> 35:08.334
and I don't think anyone
wants me to get to that point.

35:08.334 --> 35:10.000
I ordered chicken.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.959
You know it's like
a vicious cycle.

35:11.959 --> 35:14.501
-You need to release that.
-I
think you're right.

35:14.501 --> 35:17.959
Okay. Thank you.
I love you, bye.

35:17.959 --> 35:19.209
[sighs]

35:19.209 --> 35:20.542
No, there we go.

35:20.542 --> 35:23.167
Oh.

35:23.167 --> 35:24.584
Here's Glenn's soup.

35:24.584 --> 35:26.959
Hey, Glenn, can I talk
to you for a moment?

35:26.959 --> 35:36.501
Sure.

35:36.501 --> 35:38.959
-Thanks for your time.
-Okay.

35:38.959 --> 35:41.542
Um...

35:41.542 --> 35:45.584
I think that I'm not
in the environment

35:45.584 --> 35:48.042
that's conducive
to my mental wellbeing.

35:48.042 --> 35:49.501
Okay.

35:49.501 --> 35:51.959
I love my job, I love
what I do, you know...

35:51.959 --> 35:53.250
You're very good at what you do.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.959
Thank you, but I have
some work to do

35:55.959 --> 35:58.459
with my interpersonal
relationships

35:58.459 --> 36:02.083
while living and working on
a boat, and I know that.

36:02.083 --> 36:03.417
Mm-hmm.

36:03.417 --> 36:04.834
But I don't wanna
disappoint you...

36:04.834 --> 36:08.042
-Mm-hmm.
-Or let anybody down.

36:08.042 --> 36:09.584
I wanna be a part of the crew.

36:09.584 --> 36:13.501
I don't want them to feel
uncomfortable around me,

36:13.501 --> 36:17.167
or I don't want it to affect
them negatively, either.

36:17.167 --> 36:20.959
And I'm feeling that
it's the healthiest thing for me

36:20.959 --> 36:23.959
-to leave the boat.
-Okay.

36:23.959 --> 36:27.375
So, I don't wanna quit
right before a pickup,

36:27.375 --> 36:30.959
but I think it's the best
thing for me to do.

36:30.959 --> 36:35.417
Normally, I would probably
be disappointed.

36:35.417 --> 36:38.083
But I think under
these circumstances,

36:38.083 --> 36:39.959
you're making
the right decision.

36:39.959 --> 36:41.959
-We will cope.
- Mm-hmm.

36:41.959 --> 36:45.417
You're doing what's right
for you, and we support that.

36:45.417 --> 36:48.876
We'll figure it out.
We'll get...

36:48.876 --> 36:50.209
You know, but I think that's...

36:50.209 --> 36:53.167
I think I agree
with your decision.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.042
I think that's the best thing
for you to do

36:55.042 --> 36:58.042
to get yourself
in the right place.

36:58.042 --> 37:00.292
I don't really know
what's going on with Gabriela

37:00.292 --> 37:04.167
and the rest of the crew, but
after 22 years in the industry,

37:04.167 --> 37:08.000
I know it's so important, you
have to take care of yourself.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.584
We'll figure out from
our end how we move forward,

37:12.584 --> 37:16.959
but I think it's very important
that you take care of yourself,

37:16.959 --> 37:18.542
because I think you have
a lot of potential.

37:18.542 --> 37:20.459
I would love to work with
you again in the future.

37:20.459 --> 37:22.542
Thank you, Glenn, that really
means a lot to me.

37:22.542 --> 37:24.000
Thank you for all
your hard work.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.042
-Thank you.
-I really appreciate it.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.417
Thank you.

37:26.417 --> 37:28.834
I'll be really sad
to see Gabriela go.

37:28.834 --> 37:30.959
But you know, people know
when they're at their limit,

37:30.959 --> 37:32.918
and you've got to respect that.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.417
-Can I please have a hug?
-Of course.

37:35.417 --> 37:38.250
-Thanks, Glenn.
-Thank you.

37:38.250 --> 37:39.959
Ooh, okay, packing time.

37:39.959 --> 37:41.584
We should have put
tomato on this.

37:41.584 --> 37:43.042
Mm, yeah.

37:43.042 --> 37:45.083
I'll make another one.

37:45.083 --> 37:49.125
I hate quitting.
I don't wanna be a quitter.

37:49.125 --> 37:51.125
But I feel like
my work performance

37:51.125 --> 37:53.209
is now being affected by this,

37:53.209 --> 37:56.959
and I feel like it's gonna
continue to get worse if I stay.

37:56.959 --> 38:00.125
All right, so I've got a little
bit of news to report.

38:00.125 --> 38:02.959
I just had a word with Gabriela.

38:02.959 --> 38:05.584
She's just decided
that she's going to leave,

38:05.584 --> 38:08.167
so she's leaving tonight.

38:08.167 --> 38:10.626
I just wanna tell you guys
because I don't want you guys

38:10.626 --> 38:13.292
to find out when you see her
walk through here with a bag.

38:13.292 --> 38:16.167
I'm obviously very sad
to see her go.

38:16.167 --> 38:21.375
I feel guilty that I wasn't able
to make this situation work.

38:21.375 --> 38:22.626
You know, it's sad
that she's leaving,

38:22.626 --> 38:24.959
but we have to keep
moving forward.

38:24.959 --> 38:27.459
I'm working on getting
a replacement.

38:27.459 --> 38:29.959
The most important thing
is that we do the best job

38:29.959 --> 38:31.501
we can for our guests.

38:31.501 --> 38:33.250
Thank you for your time.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.250
Thanks, Glenn.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.417
[knocking]

38:36.417 --> 38:40.584
-Yeah?
-Just me.

38:40.584 --> 38:45.584
No, I have some issues
I need to work on.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.834
If it's the decision
you think is best for you,

38:47.834 --> 38:50.209
then I support you and
I'm happy for you.

38:50.209 --> 38:54.167
You've been so supportive to me
from literally day one,

38:54.167 --> 39:00.417
and I really appreciate that.

39:00.417 --> 39:01.918
I'm gonna miss you too.

39:01.918 --> 39:03.584
Despite her crazy antics,

39:03.584 --> 39:07.459
Gabriela is somebody
that I really bonded with

39:07.459 --> 39:08.959
and got along with.

39:08.959 --> 39:11.459
I'm hopeful that she is
able to become

39:11.459 --> 39:14.584
the better person that
I know she wants to be.

39:14.584 --> 39:17.334
Okay, I have to pack.
I need to go.

39:17.334 --> 39:20.292
-You okay?
-Yeah, I am okay.

39:20.292 --> 39:21.959
-You?
-Yeah.

39:21.959 --> 39:28.626
-Sad.
-Are you both?

39:28.626 --> 39:31.584
Jesus!

39:31.584 --> 39:34.042
Oh my gosh.

39:34.042 --> 39:35.584
Are you looking forward
to your 12 on, 12 off?

39:35.584 --> 39:37.584
I'm looking forward
to the bottom bunk.

39:37.584 --> 39:42.417
If you think about it, that
means one more big tip.

39:42.417 --> 39:45.959
Ashley has no mercy right now.

39:45.959 --> 40:01.876
Here I am, like, sad, and
then Ashley's like...

40:01.876 --> 40:03.167
For real, this time.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.459
Is Gabriela still here?

40:04.459 --> 40:06.083
Yeah, she's packing.

40:06.083 --> 40:07.792
-Let me help you.
-Thanks, Glenn.

40:07.792 --> 40:08.918
Ah!

40:08.918 --> 40:10.876
Whew, okay.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.209
I'm sad, because
I do really like her,

40:12.209 --> 40:14.501
and she's obviously
really good at her job.

40:14.501 --> 40:19.375
Hey, guys, I just wanna
say goodbye to everybody.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.542
Thank you guys for being as
supportive as you possibly can.

40:22.542 --> 40:26.375
I'm going through some stuff,
and I need to take care of it.

40:26.375 --> 40:28.042
That's it, I have to go now.

40:28.042 --> 40:29.250
Oh!

40:29.250 --> 40:30.959
But I wish you guys
the best season.

40:30.959 --> 40:33.792
It's not a goodbye,
but a see you soon.

40:33.792 --> 40:35.918
Thank you, it was
nice meeting everybody.

40:35.918 --> 40:39.375
Whatever ounce of strength
I have left needs to be

40:39.375 --> 40:42.959
to get me off this boat and
say goodbye to the crew.

40:42.959 --> 40:46.292
It's the hardest part
for me to deal with.

40:46.292 --> 40:47.876
Bye, keep in touch.

40:47.876 --> 40:49.375
Mm-hmm.

40:49.375 --> 40:50.959
Even though I know I'm
taking care of myself

40:50.959 --> 40:52.792
and I'm doing
the right thing, you know,

40:52.792 --> 40:57.584
a part of me still feels
like I ----ing blew it.

40:57.584 --> 40:58.876
-Be safe.
-Okay.

40:58.876 --> 41:00.083
-All right?
-I will.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.292
Have fun, guys.
----ing rock stars.

41:02.292 --> 41:03.417
Bye.

41:03.417 --> 41:07.083
But it's okay.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.501
That's gotta be
a lonely walk, huh?

41:08.501 --> 41:10.250
She's gotta figure
something out.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.417
But only she can do it, right?

41:11.417 --> 41:15.167
Yeah.

41:15.167 --> 41:18.167
Later this season on
"Below Deck Sailing Yacht"...

41:18.167 --> 41:20.209
We've come here today to witness
your marriage.

41:20.209 --> 41:22.042
-Woohoo!
-Yay!

41:22.042 --> 41:25.417
Yeah!

41:25.417 --> 41:28.375
-Whoa, Gary!
-Gary!

41:28.375 --> 41:30.542
I want a double bacon
Bloody Mary

41:30.542 --> 41:32.083
with two grilled shrimp,
no olives.

41:32.083 --> 41:34.792
Bacon, you need two stalks
of bacon in there.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.209
Couple espressos.

41:36.209 --> 41:38.125
Two more of these, and
a margarita with salt.

41:38.125 --> 41:39.375
You're gonna steam
everything, right?

41:39.375 --> 41:42.792
Could I get some
music and blankets?

41:42.792 --> 41:45.250
No, no, no, honestly,
I can't accept... oh...

41:45.250 --> 41:46.375
So, what do we have here?

41:46.375 --> 41:48.292
So, it's hard to concentrate

41:48.292 --> 41:50.417
when you have a nipple
saying, "Hello, Marcos."

41:50.417 --> 41:53.042
-So good.
-Nice boat.

41:53.042 --> 41:54.209
Are you the new deckhand?

41:54.209 --> 41:55.250
I am.

41:55.250 --> 41:57.083
Is that a new man I hear?

41:57.083 --> 41:59.959
Your new boyfriend?

41:59.959 --> 42:01.459
This is Scarlett, our new stew.

42:01.459 --> 42:02.459
-Hi!
-Good to meet you.

42:02.459 --> 42:03.542
Gary, nice to meet you.

42:03.542 --> 42:06.125
Oh sh--, here's trouble.

42:06.125 --> 42:10.334
I'm coming into such
a bad situation.

42:10.334 --> 42:11.918
Be careful of the consequences.

42:11.918 --> 42:14.167
Yeah.

42:14.167 --> 42:16.083
-No, I did not.
-It happened.

42:16.083 --> 42:19.959
He can deny it, but I remember
the ----ing penis in my vagina.

42:19.959 --> 42:24.042
Mm.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.584
-Vamanos!
-Go, go, go!

42:25.584 --> 42:28.000
Oh, here comes the
divine... look...

42:28.000 --> 42:30.334
look at my angle
starting to change.

42:30.334 --> 42:32.417
Oh [bleep].

42:32.417 --> 42:35.876
Oh, watch it, keep going,
keep going, woohoo!

42:35.876 --> 42:37.042
Oh sh--!

42:37.042 --> 42:39.417
-You okay?
-You all right?

42:39.417 --> 42:41.918
We've got a chain wrapped
round the anchor chain.

42:41.918 --> 42:44.125
Oh sh--, lost the windlass.

42:44.125 --> 42:45.375
We're dragging.

42:45.375 --> 42:47.417
We got a lot of little
boats around us.

42:47.417 --> 42:49.292
You're, like, balancing
on a knife edge.

42:49.292 --> 42:52.125
This is pretty much
the worst thing you can do.

42:52.125 --> 42:56.000
Oh, my God, stop, stop, stop!

42:56.000 --> 42:59.167
Oh!

42:59.167 --> 43:03.125
-Oh!
-Hey!
