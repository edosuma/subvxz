03:03.879 --> 03:07.926
True yoga is not about
the shape of your body

03:08.013 --> 03:09.319
but the shape of your life.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.674
This is such fucking bullshit.

03:30.340 --> 03:33.300

such mystical notions.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.737
They are undefinably absolute.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.130
I will take this piece
right here please.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.394
This is such fucking bullshit.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.404
Do you wanna play?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.277
Barry loves to play.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.282
Cut.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.982
That was beautiful, Ezra,
truly groundbreaking work.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.573
What's the word, Diamond?

04:29.747 --> 04:32.010
Yeah, I'm just super busy
here at the art gallery.

04:32.097 --> 04:33.447
Yeah, you're about
as busy over there

04:33.621 --> 04:34.883
selling overpriced
sheets of white paper

04:35.144 --> 04:37.407
as I am over here
practicing my Oscar speech.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.757
Daddy has given us
his jet and villa,

04:39.844 --> 04:43.979
we take off tomorrow for an
insta trip you won't forget.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.459
What?
No shit.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.156
That sounds amazing.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.158
Which one of your daddy's
houses are we going to?

04:50.028 --> 04:51.203
Phuket...

04:51.291 --> 04:53.205
Thailand!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.772
Are you sure it's safe there?

04:54.859 --> 04:57.079
Decap Ezra,
of course it's safe.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.602
Now go pack your shit.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.343
Wheels up first thing
in the morning.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.867
See y'all on a G tomorrow.
Diamond out.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.314
Welcome, ladies.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.490
Now where the fuck is Ryder?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.319
Oh, of course.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.720
Nice luggage, Ryder.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.069
Fuck off, Daisy.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.244
Oh you would
love to fuck Daisy.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.550
How do you know I haven't?

05:36.988 --> 05:38.686
Wow, welcome, ladies.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.427
I'm Jasper McDaniel.
I'll be your pilot.

05:40.514 --> 05:41.732
We have good weather,

05:41.993 --> 05:43.517
so we should be arriving
in Phuket on time.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.519
Sit back, relax,
enjoy the flight,

05:45.606 --> 05:48.217
and if you guys need
anything, I'll be up front.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.524
Oh my, I can think
of a few things

05:50.611 --> 05:52.308
that our captain can do to me.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.876
Diamond, just let
him focus on his job,

05:54.963 --> 05:56.965
which is literally making
sure we don't crash and die.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.270
Fuck off.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.534
Oh this is fucking awesome!

06:00.621 --> 06:03.537
Enough of the
chitchat, I want a shot.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.409
God, Daisy, the
sun's barely up.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.890
Well I'm sure the sun
is up in Thailand by now.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.980
And I'm just pro-actively
curing future jet lag.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.111
To sex.

06:13.198 --> 06:14.112
To drugs.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.505
To rock and roll.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.209
I think we should all
go around in a circle

06:24.296 --> 06:27.256
and collectively
set an intention

06:27.343 --> 06:29.084
for our vacay together.

06:29.171 --> 06:32.130
Oh my God, Ezra, stop being
so fucking introspective.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.741
Like, just relax.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.786
Here, take a pull.

06:36.570 --> 06:39.094
I wanna get into some
of that full moon powder

06:39.181 --> 06:41.923
and turn this beach
trip into a ski trip.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.707
Ryder, what about you?

06:43.794 --> 06:46.057
I wanna connect
with my friends,

06:46.144 --> 06:48.538
and have the experience
of a lifetime.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.497
That sounds
pretty fucking lame.

06:50.584 --> 06:55.806
I want to eat great
food, sleep long nights

06:55.893 --> 06:59.244
and fuck anyone I want.

07:01.595 --> 07:02.596
Daddy issues.

07:04.249 --> 07:07.296
My daddy has issues
with you on his plane.

07:07.383 --> 07:08.819
There is the fucking door, Ezra.

07:10.212 --> 07:13.084
Oh my God, chill out [laughs].

07:13.171 --> 07:17.088
Well, I intend to fuck on blow

07:17.698 --> 07:19.917
and have an experience
that we'll never forget.

07:20.657 --> 07:24.139
To motherfucking
Thailand, yeah!

08:00.044 --> 08:01.872
I gotta piss.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.526
Oh enjoy.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.310
I'm gonna go up front
to see if there's

08:05.397 --> 08:07.617
anything I can do
for our captain.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.708
Hey, please don't
fuck with him too much.

08:11.795 --> 08:14.058
I wanna get there in one piece.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.590
Ryder, what the fuck?

08:23.677 --> 08:25.026
I thought we could
use some alone time.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.723
Now is not the time.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.595
If not now, then when?

08:28.682 --> 08:30.597
Look, it's not easy, Ryder.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.729
I mean, life is
complicated for some of us.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.035
For some of us.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.559
What's that supposed to mean?

08:36.646 --> 08:38.343
Look, I am not you.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.390
I'm not all confident wrapped
up in this badassness.

08:43.348 --> 08:48.049
Daisy, you have more
badass in you than you know.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.399
Just go.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.803
This is a club I
thought I'd never join.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.456
The Bang Your
Best Friend Club.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.546
The Mile-High, you
asshole [laughs].

09:21.169 --> 09:22.823
Get some air in here, Dang.

09:23.824 --> 09:24.912
Knock, knock.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.001
Hello, Diamond.
Everything okay?

09:27.088 --> 09:28.742
Everything's great.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.700
Just thought you could
use some company.

09:31.483 --> 09:35.313
Uh, Dang, I'm
stretching my legs.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.619
Controls are off to you.

09:43.147 --> 09:46.150
Wow, you girls really
know how to trash a plane.

09:46.237 --> 09:49.066
Uh, yeah, I've had plenty
of years of experience.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.372
I believe it.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.374
Mm-hm.
So you know my dad?

09:53.288 --> 09:56.334
Not personally, but I
am a fan of his movies.

09:56.421 --> 09:59.337
Oh, I'm sensing a little bit
of mystery to you, Captain.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.165
Mystery? Me?

10:02.471 --> 10:03.777
My life's pretty boring.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.779
I wish I had something to hide.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.563
Married? Kids?

10:07.650 --> 10:10.479
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
I'm perpetually single.

10:10.566 --> 10:11.741
Mm.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.875
Well, we might have to do
something to change that.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.444
What about you?

10:20.402 --> 10:21.621
Me?

10:22.186 --> 10:24.711
Oh well, that's gonna take
at least a second date.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.282
Do me a favor.
Grab a seat, okay?

10:33.981 --> 10:35.547
Are we there?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.766
<i>Okay, ladies,</i>

10:36.853 --> 10:37.941
<i>we hit some inclement weather.</i>

10:38.028 --> 10:39.682
It's gonna get a
little bumpy, so

10:39.769 --> 10:41.118
if you could please
buckle your seat belts.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.990
We're gonna crash.
We're all gonna die!

10:43.077 --> 10:44.165
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
we're not gonna die.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.732
It's just a storm.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.603
Yeah, a storm we're right
in the fucking middle of.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.474
We're gonna die!

10:49.561 --> 10:51.389
Ryder, I used your toothbrush,
and I never told you.

10:51.476 --> 10:54.828
And, Daisy, I'm sorry I puked
in the back of your car.

10:54.915 --> 10:59.659
Diamond, I'm so sorry,
but I slept with your dad.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.575
You motherfucker!

11:03.663 --> 11:05.273
Technically, she's
a fatherfucker.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.927
What is the matter with it!

11:07.014 --> 11:11.061

know how much I love you.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.020
Yeah, thought you'd never ask.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.630

Daisy, you need
to be careful, okay?

Thailand with drugs,

Brokedown Palace.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.931
Oh you could say that.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.281
Well, I was wondering
if you could help me

17:01.368 --> 17:02.804
with a little something.

17:02.934 --> 17:05.589
Anything you need on the
island, we're your girls.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.983
I need some blow.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.680
We never touch
that shit anymore.

17:11.378 --> 17:12.422
Oh fuck off.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.871
Okay, Ezra, that's
our cue to leave.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.352
Hey, fatherfucker,
we're leaving!

17:29.961 --> 17:31.659
You fucked your dad!

17:31.746 --> 17:34.966
No, don't be silly.
I fucked her dad.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.664
- Oh my God.
- Oh.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.233
Do you know where Daisy is?

17:40.320 --> 17:42.322
Yeah, she went
in this direction.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.456
- Daisy.
- Daisy.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.805
- Daisy?
- Daisy?

17:48.589 --> 17:50.112
- Daisy.
- Daisy.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.506
She's gone. She's not here.

17:52.593 --> 17:53.898
Where the fuck is she?

17:53.985 --> 17:55.770
Maybe she went
back to the villa.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.947
She has no idea where the
villa is. She must be here.

17:59.034 --> 17:59.991
She's searching from coke.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.645
Ezra, shut up.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.517
Guys, let's just find
her and get outta here.

18:03.604 --> 18:04.735
I'm like done.

18:06.737 --> 18:07.869
Daisy?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.611
Hey, have you seen my friend?

18:10.698 --> 18:12.917
Pink shirt, dreads.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.877
We just saw her walk out with
two big Thai motherfuckers.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.706
You ever heard of
having a girl's back?

18:21.535 --> 18:22.623
So basically I'm
just looking for coke.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.233
Yeah, not the cheap stuff.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.540
Okay, I need the expensive
stuff for me and my friends.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.063
We're not cheap bitches.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.760
- Daisy?
- Daisy.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.066
Hey, we've been looking for you.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.546
I'm just making a
purchase from these

18:32.633 --> 18:34.635
fine gentlemen right here.

18:34.722 --> 18:37.681
That description seems to
be a slight embellishment.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.380
You girls want some party?
Want some company, uh?

18:40.467 --> 18:41.816
No, we don't wanna
fucking party,

18:41.903 --> 18:43.034
and we don't want your company.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.166
Okay, come on,
let's get a move on.

18:44.384 --> 18:45.254
Let's get the fuck outta here.

18:45.515 --> 18:46.777
But it's still
going on inside?

18:46.864 --> 18:48.388
Daisy, okay, time to go.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.347
Why you be so rude?
We just try to help you out.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.653
Oh, fuck you, assholes.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.002
You're coke dealers,
not missionaries.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.438
Let's go.

18:55.699 --> 18:58.702
Well. Well, we aren't
coke dealers neither.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.487
Now you rich bitches
are gonna give us

19:00.574 --> 19:01.923
all your fucking money.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.752
Look, sirs, you can,
you can have our money.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.536
Okay, but then just
please don't hurt us.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.059
Please don't hurt us.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.192
You guys wanna play?
Let's fucking play.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.413
What's going on here?

19:13.674 --> 19:15.154
Jasper?

19:15.328 --> 19:17.808
Get the fuck out of here!
This ain't your problem.

19:17.895 --> 19:18.983
Oh, I think it is.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.637
Hey, [speaks
foreign language].

19:20.724 --> 19:22.073
We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.205
Okay.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.468
Remember, you asked for this.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.949
Pressing your nose
where it doesn't belong.

19:32.214 --> 19:33.650
Please, don't shoot, okay.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.392
How did you do that?

19:38.264 --> 19:40.527
I guess I watched too many
of your father's movies.

19:40.614 --> 19:43.791
Well, you know,
we had this covered.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.096
Thank you.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.750
Thank you so much.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.361
Look, girls, I know you can
take care of yourselves

19:48.448 --> 19:50.537
but this island
can get dangerous,

19:50.624 --> 19:52.930
especially if you girls
are looking for trouble.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.759
You got something
I can write on?

19:55.846 --> 19:57.457
- Here.
- Okay.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.202
If you need anything,
that's where I'll be.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.640
Pen and paper? This guy is
so old school fucking cool.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.990
- Let's go.
- Okay, thank you.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.383
Oh my God.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.341
Who are you, Jasper?

20:13.995 --> 20:17.433
I'm just a lonely pilot
trying to enjoy his layover.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.305
Yeah, well you know,
I watched too many

20:19.392 --> 20:20.784
of my dad's films as well,

20:21.089 --> 20:24.310
and I tend to have a
pretty good read on people.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.616
A simple thank you will do.

20:26.703 --> 20:30.664
Jasper, I don't believe
you. But thank you.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.674
The bags arrived.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.545
Finally, I can get
out of these clothes.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.286
Why, did you like
shit your pants

20:44.373 --> 20:45.548
when your coke deal went south?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.289
Diamond, lay off her.

20:47.376 --> 20:50.684
I am so tired.
Anyone else wanna swim?

20:50.771 --> 20:52.207
Good idea.

20:52.381 --> 20:53.861
Bring the bags to the
room, put on our suits

20:53.948 --> 20:55.428
and meet you back in five.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.908
Uh uh, uh uh uh, I
wasn't fucking kidding.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.345
You're over there.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.480
Fuck
someone's dad once,

21:04.567 --> 21:07.701
it's like you're
a fucking pariah.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.797
Everybody
get out here!

21:16.884 --> 21:18.451
What the fuck?

21:20.757 --> 21:23.194
Don't even freak out
if you forgot a swimsuit.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.762
I have like 20, okay?

21:25.849 --> 21:29.549
No bikini, no
clothes, no nothing.

21:31.507 --> 21:32.421
Holy shit.

21:32.508 --> 21:33.770
Is that real?

21:33.857 --> 21:35.946
- I know one way to find out.
- Hey.

21:37.034 --> 21:39.080
This bag looks just like mine.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.560
This is nuts, right?

21:41.517 --> 21:43.171
We have to call Jasper.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.651
No, uh-uh.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.523
I'm not quite sure that's
our best move right now.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.699
Our best move?
He just saved our lives.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.484
There is something
off about him.

21:51.571 --> 21:55.183
For all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.838
You're being
paranoid, Diamond.

21:57.925 --> 21:58.839
Oh, really?

21:58.926 --> 22:00.536
New pilot, first flight,

22:00.623 --> 22:03.017
we know absolutely
nothing about him.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.672
Shows up out of nowhere at the
club when we're in trouble.

22:05.759 --> 22:06.934
I mean, he may have
been following us, guys.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.109
I'm just saying.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.067
You know what?
I say we do one.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.678
We'll have a night.
Call the cops in the morning
to pick it up,

22:11.765 --> 22:14.115
and we just sort
this shit out then.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.943
Just one?[Daisy] Yeah.

22:16.552 --> 22:18.032
Just one.

22:18.902 --> 22:21.731
No, guys, that
is not a good idea.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.298
Just one.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.003
Okay, just one.

22:33.656 --> 22:34.657
Fuck it.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.139
Okay, start it up.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.184
I'm gonna put this
somewhere safe

22:40.271 --> 22:44.450
so Miss Vacuum over there
doesn't get any ideas.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.454

24:07.663 --> 24:09.230
Morning.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.363
I literally feel like
a truck rode over me.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.974
Oh, that can be arranged.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.716
Come on, Diamond, you ever
gonna cut her some slack?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.108
You know it could've been worse.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.328
Yeah? How so?

24:20.415 --> 24:23.505
Well, your dad could have
fallen in love with her,

24:23.592 --> 24:26.552
married her and made
her your evil stepmommy.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.467
And then this
would be my house.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.556
Oh my God, you wish.

24:31.992 --> 24:36.039
Anyway, where's our little
bloodhound?

24:36.126 --> 24:37.824
Did she ever get to bed?

24:37.911 --> 24:39.608
I don't know.
I crashed first.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.132
Mm.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.612
Should we go wake her up?

24:43.830 --> 24:46.572
What is the rush, okay?
Just let her sleep.

24:46.659 --> 24:47.877
God.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.358
We have a big day planned.[Ezra] No.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.752
Daisy, we're coming for ya!

24:52.839 --> 24:54.493
Yes!

24:54.580 --> 24:55.711
Come on.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.409
Oh my, you bitch!

25:10.073 --> 25:11.901
Holy fuck!

25:11.988 --> 25:14.164
Oh my God. Oh my God,
what are we gonna do?

25:14.251 --> 25:16.384
What are we gonna do?
What is happening?
What is happening?

25:16.471 --> 25:17.516
I told you we shouldn't
have touched the bag.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.560
Fuck! Fuck!

25:18.647 --> 25:19.909
We have to do something.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.694
Diamond, Diamond,
we have to call the cops.

25:21.781 --> 25:22.869
We have to call
the cops, Diamond.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.088
Jasper, we need
- to call Jasper.
- We need to call your father.

25:25.175 --> 25:26.437
Your father would
know what to do.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.265
Your dad would definitely
- know what to do.
- Shh.

25:29.919 --> 25:32.792
If we call the cops,
she's dead.

25:33.357 --> 25:36.491
If we call my father,
she's dead.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.581
If we call anyone, she's dead.

25:40.451 --> 25:41.844
We need to handle this.

25:44.499 --> 25:45.848
- Diamond.
- We need to handle this.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.154
Diamond.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.721
How are we gonna handle this?

25:48.808 --> 25:50.679
I can't even handle it.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.848
Diamond, this isn't one of
your dad's fucking movies.

26:28.935 --> 26:30.676
This is real life.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.895
- Get serious.
- I am serious.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.637
If what I say isn't
exactly what happens,

26:35.724 --> 26:37.030
then go ahead, call the cops.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.684
What are you talking about?

26:38.771 --> 26:40.990
We're going to get
a call any minute.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.297
Ezra, you're gonna
answer the phone.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.516
Read exactly what I wrote.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.736
And then just, just hang up.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.434
This is not a fucking film.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.354
Answer it.

26:59.661 --> 27:00.706
Answer it.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.195
We have what you want.

27:14.502 --> 27:19.638
But, we also have a very
particular set of skills.

27:20.900 --> 27:24.251
Skills that we've acquired
over the years of our careers.

27:26.296 --> 27:29.517
Skills that make us a
nightmare for people like you.

27:31.171 --> 27:34.522
If you let our friend go now,
that'll be the end of it.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.611
We will not pursue you.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.005
But if you don't,

27:39.919 --> 27:41.485
we will look for you.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.749
We will find you.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.882
And we will kill you.

27:51.495 --> 27:54.368
That was fucking
awesome [laughs]!

27:55.543 --> 27:57.066
You guys believe me now?

27:57.153 --> 27:58.459
Diamond, what have we
gotten ourselves into?

27:58.546 --> 28:00.330
I know, but fuck this.

28:01.505 --> 28:02.855
We're gonna go save Daisy.

28:06.554 --> 28:07.729
Okay.

28:09.296 --> 28:12.429
Okay, let's just break
down what happened.

28:12.516 --> 28:15.606
When the plane landed, somehow
Ryder's bag got mixed up

28:15.694 --> 28:17.608
with some kind of drug shipment.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.307
Whew.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.135
Now, who could have done this?

28:22.222 --> 28:24.790
There were only two other
people than us on the plane.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.576
But Jasper saved us.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.621
No, for all we know,
he was following us

28:30.709 --> 28:32.667
to find the missing bag.

28:32.754 --> 28:36.366
We can't trust him.
We can't trust anyone.

28:39.108 --> 28:42.721
Okay, they come in last night
looking for their product.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.506
They couldn't find it, so
they take collateral, Daisy.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.815
This is seriously nuts.

28:49.902 --> 28:51.599
We have what they want.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.644
Well, they have what we want.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.255
Who is they?

28:55.342 --> 28:56.952
It's a golden triangle.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.607
What is a golden triangle?

28:59.694 --> 29:01.565
It's the area where
the borders of Laos,

29:01.652 --> 29:03.654
Myanmar and Thailand meet.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.048
One of the world's busiest
drug trafficking regions,

29:06.135 --> 29:09.530
and, guys, we've just
fucked with the balance

29:09.617 --> 29:11.488
of the Thai's drug cartel.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.577
Oh shit! Oh fuck.

29:13.664 --> 29:14.970
Oh my God.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.539
So what's our next move?

29:18.626 --> 29:20.541
They will contact us
and deliver instructions

29:20.628 --> 29:22.586
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.720
Likely somewhere in town
with lots of people around.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.289
Diamond, this is all just
like a little bit too much,

29:29.376 --> 29:31.552
but I don't think that growing
up on your dad's movie sets

29:31.639 --> 29:34.729
makes you exactly qualified
or me exactly qualified

29:34.816 --> 29:38.037
to, you know, do a
hostage rescue situation.

29:38.124 --> 29:39.995
Yeah, I'm with her.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.736
You have to believe me.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.391
I know we all love Daisy
and we need her back safe,

29:44.478 --> 29:45.740
but at this point,

29:48.134 --> 29:49.744
the only ones that
are going to be able

29:49.831 --> 29:52.312
to do this are the three of us.

29:55.924 --> 29:56.925
I do have one
question, though.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.274
Yeah, so do I.

29:58.492 --> 30:00.363
- Where's the blow?
- Where's the cocaine?

30:01.930 --> 30:03.062
Follow me.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.857
What is this?

30:15.944 --> 30:17.467
Panic room.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.730
Okay, so you tell us now
that you have a panic room?

30:20.688 --> 30:22.733
Because this is like
a totally normal thing

30:22.821 --> 30:24.823
that one has in
the house, right?

30:27.608 --> 30:28.565
What up?

30:28.652 --> 30:30.480
This is fucking awesome.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.831
That's a lot of guns.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.789
What is that?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.705
Oh, that's a Replicator.
It's a 3-D printer.

30:37.792 --> 30:40.360
This is fucking badass!

30:40.969 --> 30:42.579
Okay, why does Daddy...

30:44.625 --> 30:46.496
What does your daddy
have one of these?

30:46.583 --> 30:50.109
Uh, because he's rich and
famous and his life has value.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.198
He builds these panic
rooms for us everywhere.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.939
Like, gives him peace of mind.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.333
And here it is.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.770
No one knows about this room.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.208
There is no way of
finding it, tracking it.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.687
It's basically invisible.

31:05.733 --> 31:06.777
Diamond, what are we gonna do?

31:08.127 --> 31:10.694
We're going to town and act
as if nothing has happened.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.392
We don't alert anyone.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.872
They will find us and
deliver instructions

31:13.959 --> 31:15.438
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.701
Okay, and then what next?

31:17.788 --> 31:21.227
Then the shit, all gets real.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.971
Who fucking has one of these?

31:26.058 --> 31:27.668
I bail.

31:38.635 --> 31:39.767
There's so many people.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.856
Are you sure this
was a good idea?

31:41.943 --> 31:43.553
Three beers please.

31:43.814 --> 31:46.165
Okay, I'm with Ezra. How are
we gonna do this on our own?

31:46.252 --> 31:47.906
By staying calm.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.603
I'm so stressed out.

31:49.733 --> 31:52.867
Look, if it was just one of us,
we would be in deep shit.

31:52.954 --> 31:56.088
If it was just two of us,
we would be totally fucked.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.046
But the three of us together,

31:58.133 --> 32:01.093
we make up one pretty
fucking lethal weapon.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.703
How do you figure?

32:02.790 --> 32:06.925
We have the brains,
the body and the bimbo.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.318
Go on, yeah.

32:09.405 --> 32:12.191
I have lived every
one of my dad's films.

32:12.278 --> 32:15.498
I know these guys, what
they think, how they plan.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.631
I know their moves
before they do.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.328
I'm the brains.

32:20.286 --> 32:21.809
Ryder, you are the body.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.637
Your years of avoiding
anything in life that

32:23.724 --> 32:26.509
is actually fun and
focusing all your energy

32:26.596 --> 32:28.163
on those extreme sporty things

32:28.250 --> 32:30.339
gives you a leg up
on these cocksuckers.

32:30.426 --> 32:33.473
When we need some
physical action, it's you.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.563
Oh, so that
makes me the bimbo.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.480
And what exactly do
you mean by that?

32:40.567 --> 32:42.308
It means, you're an actor.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.832
You're our voice.

32:44.919 --> 32:47.574
The words we say need to
come convincingly from you.

32:49.619 --> 32:53.275
Yeah, I can do that but I'm
really fucking stressed out.

32:53.362 --> 32:54.581
I'm literally panicking.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.105
Chill.

33:03.764 --> 33:04.678
What did he say?

33:04.765 --> 33:06.201
Fuck do I know?

33:10.379 --> 33:13.992
The boy is saying the
daisies are in full bloom.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.515
No they're not.
They're like wilted.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.865
Buy the flowers.
Buy them now, buy them.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.301
Oh shit.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.520
Uh.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.399
What do we do?

33:30.486 --> 33:31.574
Open it.

33:31.661 --> 33:32.706
Carefully.

33:32.793 --> 33:33.924
Me?

33:34.534 --> 33:35.578
I don't want to.

33:36.666 --> 33:37.711
Could be a bomb.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.669
- Shut up.
- Just do it.

33:43.412 --> 33:44.674
What is it?

33:44.761 --> 33:46.502
Oh, shit.

33:47.590 --> 33:48.852
Come over.

33:52.987 --> 33:55.685
- Turn it on.
- No, no. No.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.601
Turn it on carefully.

34:13.181 --> 34:15.314
This here is a banana spider.

34:16.880 --> 34:20.014
It is the most venomous
spider in the world.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.625
There is no antivenom.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.019
So I suggest that
you don't move.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.895
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

34:34.115 --> 34:35.856
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

34:35.943 --> 34:36.987
<i>There we go.</i>

34:46.040 --> 34:48.564
Okay. Listen to me carefully.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.916
<i>Go to the Fountain
Circle at Old Geptown.</i>

34:53.003 --> 34:56.572
<i>There you will see
a big banyan tree.</i>

34:56.659 --> 34:59.923
<i>Be on the bench next
to it tomorrow at noon.</i>

35:00.010 --> 35:03.362
Bring the product, and
I'll bring your friend.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.112
Oh my God. Oh my God.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.678
This is so fucked up.

35:17.332 --> 35:20.596
If anything happens to Daisy,
if anything happens--

35:20.683 --> 35:22.076
She will be fine.

35:22.946 --> 35:23.947
Okay.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.559
She is really strong.

35:26.646 --> 35:29.083
Okay, we're just gonna
follow their instructions and...

35:30.171 --> 35:32.130
by this time tomorrow
Daisy will be back with us

35:32.217 --> 35:35.350
and we can get
the fuck out of here.

35:38.701 --> 35:40.050
She's right.

35:40.747 --> 35:43.228
Let's just get back to the
villa and plan for tomorrow.

35:43.315 --> 35:44.794
Oh my God, Ezra.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.753
I am sorry.
You need to be clear of mind.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.102
Come on.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.121
We need to get
ready for tomorrow.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.688
Always be prepared
for the worst.

36:09.776 --> 36:10.864
Yeah, and what's that?

36:11.734 --> 36:13.780
These guys don't
give a shit about us.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.912
As soon as they get
their stuff back,

36:15.999 --> 36:18.219
we no longer have
any value to them.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.047
We can't trust
anything they say.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.962
They will try to cheat us.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.226
And then what?

36:25.313 --> 36:26.619
Plan B.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.577
What's Plan B?

36:28.664 --> 36:31.232
That is a very good
question I don't have

36:31.319 --> 36:33.060
the answer to right now.

36:33.147 --> 36:36.585
Anyway, tomorrow, Ryder,
you will do the drop.

36:36.672 --> 36:39.022
Ezra and I will find vantage
points where we can see

36:39.109 --> 36:41.068
everything that's going on.

36:41.155 --> 36:42.591
We'll be your eyes and ears.

36:43.723 --> 36:44.941
Eyes and ears.

36:47.509 --> 36:48.554
So what next?

36:49.772 --> 36:50.947
Target practice.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.168
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:54.255 --> 36:55.691
Okay, ladies, now,

36:55.778 --> 36:58.390
the most important thing
when you're firing a gun

36:58.477 --> 37:00.783
is your breath.

37:00.870 --> 37:02.698
Control your breathing
to keep yourself steady.

37:04.657 --> 37:07.790
Take aim through here and
slowly pull the trigger.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.099
You need to be gentle.

37:12.186 --> 37:15.189
Slow. It's the foreplay
before the fuck.

37:20.194 --> 37:21.717
Why doesn't that surprise me?

37:21.804 --> 37:24.154
Years of working on
that bullshit cop show,

37:24.242 --> 37:25.895
and still nothing
to show for it.

37:25.982 --> 37:28.724
Okay, let me make
this easy for you.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.726
Hold the rifle steadily.

37:30.813 --> 37:33.860
Put the butt firmly into
the pocket of your shoulder.

37:33.947 --> 37:35.644
Relax your body.

37:35.731 --> 37:38.386
Aim that little dot where
you want the bullet to go.

37:38.473 --> 37:39.605
And fire.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.045
Okay.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.961
Are you positive that we should
be handling these things?

37:48.048 --> 37:49.963
Like what, what makes
you such an expert

37:50.050 --> 37:52.879
on this, Diamond, like
playing with your dad's toys?

37:52.966 --> 37:54.402
Dad's toys?

38:00.190 --> 38:03.759
Yeah, I suppose so.
Get some sleep, ladies.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.640
Do you think it's
gonna be hot on the roof?

38:17.425 --> 38:18.731
It's showtime.

38:18.818 --> 38:20.559
Yeah, but can we please,
like, be careful?

38:20.646 --> 38:22.952
Yeah, sure.
Whatever, Mom.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.345
What's in the bag?

38:25.868 --> 38:27.392
More toys.

38:27.479 --> 38:28.828
You ready?

38:28.915 --> 38:30.220
Let's go.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.007
She's fucking crazy.

38:59.641 --> 39:02.775
Come to Thailand,
it'll be sick.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.385
It'll be a blast.

39:04.472 --> 39:06.692
Oh Ryder, you're
doing just fine.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.215
<i>Just take a seat on the bench.</i>

39:15.396 --> 39:17.398
<i>You look great, by the way.</i>

39:29.236 --> 39:31.064
Shit, there's a phone here.

39:32.021 --> 39:33.240
What do I do?

39:33.327 --> 39:34.372
Answer it.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.591
<i>Don't speak, just listen.</i>

39:41.901 --> 39:43.076
<i>There's a black van that's</i>

39:43.163 --> 39:45.383
pulling into the
square right now.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.688
<i>Look to your left.</i>

39:52.607 --> 39:55.784
<i>Also, there's a trash
bin beyond the tree.</i>

39:57.264 --> 39:58.918
<i>Drop the duffel
bag into the bin,</i>

39:59.484 --> 40:00.833
and we'll let your friend go.

40:05.359 --> 40:06.665
Something does not feel right.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.623
Ryder, just put the
drugs in the trash bin

40:08.710 --> 40:09.798
<i>and let's get Daisy home.</i>

40:25.988 --> 40:27.381
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

40:37.304 --> 40:38.871
It's not her!

40:38.958 --> 40:40.307
Shit, run!

40:45.268 --> 40:46.313
Okay, let's go.

41:20.129 --> 41:21.609
Stop, stop, stop!

42:19.493 --> 42:21.669
Ah! Fuckers!

42:21.756 --> 42:23.236
We are in way over our heads,

42:23.323 --> 42:25.238
and we need to
call the cops now!

42:25.325 --> 42:26.718
No cops, Ezra.

42:26.805 --> 42:28.154
Diamond's right.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.156
These assholes fucked
with the wrong girls.

42:30.243 --> 42:31.853
Payback's gonna be a bitch.

42:31.984 --> 42:34.552
Okay, tough guy, one problem.
We have no leverage.

42:34.639 --> 42:37.337
They have Daisy and now
they also have the cocaine.

42:37.424 --> 42:38.991
Fuck, she's right.

42:42.603 --> 42:43.691
We're fucking screwed.

42:46.564 --> 42:47.869
Holy shit.

42:47.956 --> 42:49.741
Holy shit.

42:49.871 --> 42:52.961
Yeah, they were never going
to just hand Daisy back to us.

42:53.048 --> 42:54.963
This was always the first
step in getting her back.

42:55.050 --> 42:57.226
That's how I knew it
wasn't Daisy today.

42:57.313 --> 43:00.186
Bold move D-dog,
you gonna tell us or?

43:00.273 --> 43:02.188
I needed you guys
to be convincing.

43:02.275 --> 43:03.537
Okay, I just, I need a break.

43:03.624 --> 43:05.234
I am so stressed out right now.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.151
Wait, if the coke
was here, then--

43:09.238 --> 43:10.979
What was in the
bag I gave them?

43:11.153 --> 43:13.591
Oh, it was just filled with
Ezra's panties, bras and all.

43:15.201 --> 43:16.637
Okay, so are we even now?

43:16.724 --> 43:19.118
Not even.
But we're getting there.

43:19.684 --> 43:22.469
All right, what's next?
Plan B.

43:24.993 --> 43:26.647
What are you thinking?

43:27.039 --> 43:30.259
<i>Of the Thai drug cartel, an
avid supporter of Muay Thai</i>

43:30.346 --> 43:33.393
<i>Koon has been rumored to be
training his prizefighter</i>

43:33.480 --> 43:37.527
<i>known as Goliath in a
completely unconventional way.</i>

43:37.615 --> 43:39.878
Pause it. Pause it,
pause it, pause it.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.098
What are you thinking?

43:44.665 --> 43:46.319
Tomorrow at the fight club,

43:46.406 --> 43:48.843
we're gonna kidnap the head
of Thai's drug cartel.

43:48.930 --> 43:50.105
and trade him for Daisy.

43:50.192 --> 43:52.455
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

43:52.542 --> 43:54.544
You've lost your mind.
You've lost your mind.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.416
No, I'm down.

43:56.503 --> 43:58.287
I'll do whatever it
takes to get Daisy back.

43:58.374 --> 44:00.899
Good to know.
We've gotta start stretching.

44:00.986 --> 44:02.988
Fine, what's the plan?

44:03.075 --> 44:05.773
Ezra, are you still
shooting up that teen tox?

44:07.122 --> 44:08.210
What?

44:10.604 --> 44:11.518
Now and then.

44:11.605 --> 44:12.780
Oh.

44:14.477 --> 44:16.131
Go grab your syringes.

44:16.436 --> 44:19.657
Then go to Daisy's room and
take all of her sleeping pills.

44:19.744 --> 44:22.311
Ryder, you know how to
work that 3-D printer?

44:22.398 --> 44:24.052
Fuck yeah.

44:24.270 --> 44:27.447
Okay, it's time to kiss my
Balmain latex one-piece goodbye.

44:27.534 --> 44:29.014
Why?

44:29.101 --> 44:30.363
Trust me.

44:30.624 --> 44:32.017
Okay, let's go.

44:32.104 --> 44:33.366
Okay.

45:03.701 --> 45:07.617
<i>In our path, he will
be the next undis--</i>

45:37.604 --> 45:38.779
I really hope
you don't expect us

45:38.866 --> 45:39.911
to go out with you tonight.

45:39.998 --> 45:42.130
No. I don't want us to go out.

45:42.217 --> 45:43.479
Great, great.

45:43.566 --> 45:44.742
I'm going out.

45:44.829 --> 45:46.047
What?

45:46.134 --> 45:47.396
I'm seeing Jasper.

45:47.483 --> 45:48.702
- Oh.
- You really think tonight

45:48.789 --> 45:50.225
is the time for you

45:50.312 --> 45:52.575
to dip your butt
back to the dating pool?

45:52.662 --> 45:56.275
Well, you know, there's
something off about him.

45:56.362 --> 45:58.886
Something he's not telling us.

45:58.973 --> 46:02.324
And you're gonna use your
vagina to get it outta him?

46:04.892 --> 46:06.546
No, babe.

46:07.286 --> 46:09.114
But for all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

46:09.201 --> 46:11.420
So, you know what they say,

46:11.507 --> 46:14.032
keep your friends close but
keep your enemies closer.

46:15.033 --> 46:18.384
Yeah, you know what they
also say? Don't fuck the enemy.

46:19.646 --> 46:21.126
Focus on tomorrow.

46:21.387 --> 46:24.694
Make sure you understand
exactly what needs to be done.

46:24.782 --> 46:27.480
We mess up, we're all dead.

46:27.567 --> 46:28.873
Don't wait up.

46:48.718 --> 46:51.852
Wow.
You clean up nice.

46:51.939 --> 46:54.333
And you barely
cleaned up at all.

46:54.420 --> 46:56.639
Vodka martini,
shaken, not stirred.

47:00.905 --> 47:03.777
So, are you surprised I called?

47:04.691 --> 47:05.735
No.

47:06.475 --> 47:07.737
I'm not.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.087
I'm more surprised you called

47:09.217 --> 47:11.089
and you're not in
some kind of trouble.

47:11.654 --> 47:12.699
Funny.

47:14.483 --> 47:16.094
How's the trip going so far?

47:17.791 --> 47:20.141
Mm, could be better.
Could be worse.

47:21.142 --> 47:22.317
Right.

47:24.537 --> 47:26.017
What about Daisy?

47:27.496 --> 47:30.325
Daisy seemed a little
shaken up the other night.

47:32.110 --> 47:34.590
Daisy, you know, she's Daisy.

47:34.677 --> 47:37.245
Always seems to
get in trouble, but

47:37.332 --> 47:39.421
always finds her way out.

47:40.379 --> 47:41.380
Cheers.

47:42.076 --> 47:43.251
Right.

47:45.558 --> 47:47.734
What's your deal, Diamond?

47:48.517 --> 47:51.607
I feel like there's a lot
going on inside of you that

47:51.694 --> 47:53.609
you don't allow people to see.

47:54.480 --> 47:56.090
There's always more.

47:56.177 --> 47:57.744
Okay, go on.

47:59.920 --> 48:04.098
Look, everyone thinks
growing up in Hollywood,

48:04.185 --> 48:05.839
jumping around the world,

48:05.926 --> 48:09.321
they think this life
is a dream come true.

48:10.365 --> 48:11.714
And in so many ways it is.

48:13.107 --> 48:16.589
But, my mom left
when I was a kid.

48:18.156 --> 48:20.985
One night she just
packed up and was gone.

48:21.072 --> 48:22.638
No goodbyes, nothing.

48:24.597 --> 48:28.383
My dad took it really hard.
He struggled for years.

48:29.297 --> 48:31.691
He put all his
energy into his work,

48:31.778 --> 48:34.563
and nothing else mattered.

48:35.695 --> 48:37.175
Not even me.

48:38.872 --> 48:42.093
I guess work became his drug and

48:42.180 --> 48:45.748
then it was success,
and now it's the girls.

48:45.835 --> 48:47.794
Trying to make him
feel young again.

48:49.361 --> 48:52.668
And, in the midst of all this,

48:53.887 --> 48:55.280
I had to grow up on my own.

48:57.499 --> 49:01.547
Figure out who I really am
and what I really want and

49:02.896 --> 49:04.158
I think I'm still trying.

49:06.465 --> 49:08.641
I think you're doing
a pretty good job.

49:13.385 --> 49:14.603
You wanna take a walk?

49:16.910 --> 49:18.216
Mm-hm.

49:19.652 --> 49:22.263
So, what's your deal, Jasper?

49:22.350 --> 49:23.482
Me?

49:23.743 --> 49:25.658
Yeah, the man
with many questions

49:25.745 --> 49:27.399
and never a single answer.

49:27.921 --> 49:29.140
Um.

49:32.621 --> 49:35.276
There's not really much
glitz and glamor in my life.

49:35.363 --> 49:36.930
I mean...

49:38.062 --> 49:40.281
my parents split
up when I was young

49:40.368 --> 49:44.546
and, careful, my dad
was a New York cop.

49:44.633 --> 49:46.200
Mm?

49:46.287 --> 49:49.769
My mom took
a cushy job in LA and

49:50.465 --> 49:53.207
kinda, just like you,
was fending for my own.

49:53.294 --> 49:54.382
Right?

49:54.643 --> 49:56.471
We had enough to
make ends meet, but

49:57.690 --> 50:00.519
pretty much raised
myself, you know.

50:00.606 --> 50:04.392
Don't know if I did a good job,

50:05.306 --> 50:07.874
but yeah, flying is

50:09.223 --> 50:11.704
the only thing that
made me feel free.

50:13.227 --> 50:16.970
Flying up there, high
above my troubles.

50:19.799 --> 50:20.887
I guess we have more in common

50:20.974 --> 50:22.367
with each other than we thought.

50:22.454 --> 50:23.542
Yeah.

52:45.074 --> 52:47.860
I see what you mean about
keeping the enemies close.

52:47.947 --> 52:51.559
Did you find
anything out at least?

52:51.646 --> 52:55.302
Yeah, I found out
we can't trust Jasper.

52:55.389 --> 52:56.869
Oh, shit.

52:57.435 --> 52:59.741
You have
all the supplies?

52:59.828 --> 53:01.439
Yeah.[Diamond] You got everything?

53:01.526 --> 53:02.875
Mm-hm.
Everything.

53:03.049 --> 53:04.616
You understand exactly
what we're doing?

53:04.703 --> 53:06.922
Diamond, we're fine.

53:08.968 --> 53:11.100
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

53:12.058 --> 53:14.582
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

53:14.669 --> 53:17.194
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

53:33.993 --> 53:36.648
Another victim
falls to our Goliath.

53:36.735 --> 53:39.651
There is no obstacle
in our path.

53:39.738 --> 53:43.524
He will be the next
undisputed champion.

53:43.872 --> 53:46.092
He is unstoppable.

53:46.179 --> 53:49.661
Another day, and he's
destroyed everyone in sight.

53:52.968 --> 53:54.535
Got time for one more?

53:56.972 --> 53:58.147
A woman?

53:59.410 --> 54:01.586
Here's our buy-in.
Ryder, go get ready.

54:04.153 --> 54:06.678
You just bought a ticket
for your friend's funeral.

54:08.680 --> 54:09.681
Do you have a name?

54:09.768 --> 54:11.030
Diamond.

54:11.378 --> 54:12.292
Just Diamond?

54:12.379 --> 54:13.728
Just Diamond.

54:13.902 --> 54:15.861
And what brings you to
my country, Just Diamond?

54:15.948 --> 54:17.471
I'm here on vacation.

54:17.558 --> 54:19.386
And how has that been so far?

54:19.952 --> 54:21.780
Pretty uneventful.

54:22.389 --> 54:24.609
We'll certainly have
to change that, won't we?

54:29.091 --> 54:30.354
I'm counting on that.

54:44.106 --> 54:46.283
I'll be gracious and
keep all your money.

54:46.370 --> 54:47.675
Tell your friend to go home.

54:47.762 --> 54:49.416
She has nothing to prove.

54:49.590 --> 54:51.549
Perhaps we can get to know
each other a little better.

54:51.636 --> 54:55.509
How about I make
you that same offer?

55:18.489 --> 55:20.665
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

55:21.579 --> 55:22.536
You found it.

56:03.795 --> 56:05.362
The end is near for your friend.

56:06.406 --> 56:08.190
Shall we double the wager?

56:08.277 --> 56:12.064
Diamond, you shine
bright, but clearly flawed.

57:07.772 --> 57:09.251
I've never lost in anything.

57:15.214 --> 57:16.389
Let's fuck.

57:35.669 --> 57:37.236
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

57:37.323 --> 57:39.456
Ryder, grab your shit
and let's get out of here.

58:00.607 --> 58:02.870
Did you really think you
would leave without me?

58:02.957 --> 58:04.219
Get in.

58:08.397 --> 58:10.051
I thought you'd never ask.

58:13.359 --> 58:14.491
Let's go.

58:18.973 --> 58:20.322
Holy fuck, we did it.

58:20.888 --> 58:22.499
My heart's about to explode.

58:22.586 --> 58:24.892
Guys, this is still
so far from over.

58:24.979 --> 58:26.981
How many sleeping pills did
you shoot him up with?

59:23.211 --> 59:25.649
You just signed your death wish!

59:25.736 --> 59:27.868
Come on, we just want to talk.

59:27.955 --> 59:29.827
Shit.

59:29.914 --> 59:33.004
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

59:33.091 --> 59:35.615
Don't waste your energy.
You're tied up pretty good.

59:37.182 --> 59:38.270
Where am I?

59:38.357 --> 59:39.663
Where you are doesn't matter.

59:39.750 --> 59:42.404
Where our friend Daisy is does.

59:42.491 --> 59:43.971
What is Daisy?

59:44.058 --> 59:46.713
Daisy is our friend that
your cartel kidnapped.

59:46.800 --> 59:48.193
And I know nothing of this.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.716
You see, that I believe.

59:49.803 --> 59:51.631
But all we wanted was
to come to Phuket,

59:51.718 --> 59:53.938
have a little vacay,
maybe dance a bit,

59:54.025 --> 59:55.766
drink a bit, fuck a bit.

59:55.853 --> 59:57.985
But that just isn't
happening now.

59:58.072 --> 59:59.291
She's right.

59:59.552 --> 01:00:01.249
We get back to our
villa on our first night

01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:02.816
and my shit-for-crap duffel bag

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:04.557
is full of bricks of cocaine.

01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:07.691
Somehow your product got
mixed up with our luggage.

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:08.866
And we wake up the next morning

01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:10.824
and our friend Daisy is gone.

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:30.539
Silly bitches,
did you not think

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.498
that they would
come looking for me?

01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:35.893
Oh sweetheart,
of course we did.

01:00:42.987 --> 01:00:44.466
We're over here!

01:00:44.553 --> 01:00:45.511
Come up here!

01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:46.947
Come and get us!

01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:48.557
We've kidnapped the head
of the Thai drug cartel,

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.516
and he's being held
hostage by three...

01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:53.388
Silly, silly bitches!

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:57.349
Oh, you're basically dab
smack in the middle of nowhere.

01:00:57.436 --> 01:01:01.614
No one can hear you, and no
one is ever going to find you.

01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:06.097
See, we needed
something more valuable

01:01:06.184 --> 01:01:08.186
than coke to get her back.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.710
We needed you.

01:01:21.852 --> 01:01:23.375
Oh, your boyfriend's here.

01:01:25.856 --> 01:01:27.118
You have a boyfriend?

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.815
Sorry, man.

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.560
I'm gonna go see what he wants.

01:01:38.564 --> 01:01:40.044
Jasper?

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.177
What are you doing here?

01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:49.096
Well you left rather
quickly in the morning,

01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:50.576
so I thought I'd
just check up on you.

01:01:50.663 --> 01:01:52.317
I'm fine. I'm a big girl.

01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:54.232
I don't need anyone
checking in on me.

01:01:55.537 --> 01:01:56.974
Diamond, there's something
you should know, okay?

01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:59.150
Don't move an inch more.

01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:02.414
I will light you up, Jasper,
or whoever the fuck you are.

01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:04.024
Diamond, put the
gun down, okay?

01:02:04.111 --> 01:02:07.636
Come on. I know you're
involved in all this.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.203
I found Ryder's
bag in your room.

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:12.424
All right, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:13.860
I've been watching you girls,

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:16.036
but I know all about
the drugs, okay.

01:02:16.123 --> 01:02:17.690
Raise your hands.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:19.431
I'm with the fucking DEA.

01:02:21.912 --> 01:02:24.131
The badge is in my back pocket.

01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:26.481
Show me.

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:27.961
Slowly.

01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.195
What the fuck?

01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:52.769
They're using your
father's jet as a mule.

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.118
They've been chartering
cocaine in and out

01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:56.294
of the golden
triangle for years.

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:57.512
We've got the pilot in custody.

01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.427
He's been working
with the cartel.

01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:02.082
Is my dad involved in this?

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:05.564
No, he's not. He doesn't
know anything about it.

01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:07.174
What happened?

01:03:08.045 --> 01:03:09.786
We hit some bad air.

01:03:10.612 --> 01:03:12.745
Got there a little
bit ahead of schedule.

01:03:12.832 --> 01:03:14.486
The plan was to make
another run to the US.

01:03:14.573 --> 01:03:15.966
Look, I don't know.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.055
Honestly, I don't know
how the bags got mixed up.

01:03:18.142 --> 01:03:20.231
But you knew about Daisy
and her being kidnapped.

01:03:20.318 --> 01:03:21.710
I do.

01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:28.935
I assumed they would come back
to the villa for the bags.

01:03:29.022 --> 01:03:31.024
I didn't think they were
gonna snatch up Daisy.

01:03:31.982 --> 01:03:34.201
These are bad fucking dudes.

01:03:34.288 --> 01:03:37.248
I'm in too deep with them.
I can't blow my cover.

01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:39.206
I do have a contact at the DEA.

01:03:40.164 --> 01:03:42.122
He's gonna call the embassy.

01:03:42.209 --> 01:03:44.733
Hopefully set up a
rescue team for Daisy.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.474
No, no fucking way.

01:03:47.171 --> 01:03:48.172
What?

01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:49.608
We've got this covered.

01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:51.740
What do you got covered?

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.047
This is the Thai drug cartel.

01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:57.442
Well now that you've
been honest with me,

01:03:57.529 --> 01:03:59.357
I should probably
come clean with you.

01:04:08.801 --> 01:04:10.498
What the fuck is this?

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:13.414
That's the head of Thai cartel.

01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:14.676
Calm down.

01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:16.765
Calm down.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:20.552
D, this isn't a fucking movie.
You're not Wonder Woman.

01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:22.728
Fuck you. Because I'm
a girl, I'm Wonder Woman?

01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:24.643
No, I just don't
want you to get hurt.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.561
You actually care, don't you?

01:04:29.648 --> 01:04:31.302
Of course I care.

01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:34.435
Let's do it like this.
Just give me 24 hours.

01:04:35.088 --> 01:04:36.960
If we can't get Daisy
back on our own,

01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:38.526
do what you need to do.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.659
But, you know, best-case
scenario, we rescue Daisy,

01:04:40.746 --> 01:04:42.661
you get to keep your
cover and we all go back

01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:46.056
to our lives before
all this mess.

01:04:48.623 --> 01:04:50.712
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:54.064
You've got 24 hours, okay?

01:04:55.326 --> 01:04:56.631
Oh wait.

01:04:57.632 --> 01:04:59.852
There's one thing I'm
gonna need from you.

01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:01.419
Yeah, what's that?

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.291
Meet me here tomorrow
morning. I'll explain then.

01:05:07.338 --> 01:05:08.426
So cute.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:10.819
Anyway.

01:05:30.187 --> 01:05:31.623
Are you trying to scare me?

01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:33.842
Are you kidding me?

01:05:34.408 --> 01:05:37.194
Do you not think I've
been tortured before?

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:39.196
Oh, ye of little faith.

01:05:40.632 --> 01:05:41.676
Muzzle this fucker.

01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:47.334
Oh Ryder, what the fuck?

01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:49.032
You're not the
only one with toys.

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.338
And it's pink.

01:05:51.425 --> 01:05:52.513
Okay.

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.568
<i>You think there's a game?</i>

01:06:03.655 --> 01:06:05.700
<i>You must not value
your friend's life.</i>

01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:08.747
Well, I guess we don't.
So fucking kill her.

01:06:08.834 --> 01:06:10.575
<i>Don't push me, little girls.</i>

01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:12.142
<i>How do you know she's
not already dead?</i>

01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:14.666
Oh, because I
have what you want,

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:15.928
and the only way you're
gonna get it back

01:06:16.015 --> 01:06:17.843
is by giving me what I want.

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.889
<i>And you think you have
leverage? You don't.</i>

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.370
<i>I don't give a fuck
about the coke!</i>

01:06:23.457 --> 01:06:26.460
But, Spyder, it's not the
coke that is our leverage.

01:06:26.547 --> 01:06:28.114
It's the delivery boy.

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:34.555
<i>Jesus Fucking Christ.</i>

01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:36.949
Meet me tomorrow at the
Big Buddha Temple, same time.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:39.821
You wanna see him alive,
you do exactly as I say.

01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:45.523
Unmuzzle him.

01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:52.443
Do you think you're gonna
leave that place alive?

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:53.922
Oh, who's the fool now?

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.707
We have no intention
to ever meet there

01:06:55.794 --> 01:06:57.317
or anywhere tomorrow.

01:06:57.404 --> 01:06:59.145
Now, you're gonna
tell us where the fuck

01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:00.451
your goons are
keeping our friend.

01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:01.930
Or what?

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.541
You gonna cut off my finger?

01:07:03.628 --> 01:07:05.108
Mm, something like that.

01:07:06.805 --> 01:07:10.504
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:13.855
and welcome to the stage,

01:07:13.942 --> 01:07:19.948

Listen closely. I am the

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.062
So you're gonna tell
me where Daisy is.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.412
One chance, right now.

01:08:32.847 --> 01:08:35.633
Or I'm gonna huff,
and I'm gonna huff

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.505
and I'm gonna cut
your fucking dick off.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:40.725
Ah.

01:08:42.509 --> 01:08:45.251
You better think carefully
about your next word.

01:08:57.655 --> 01:08:59.309
There's a factory.

01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:03.922
Your friend is being held

01:09:04.618 --> 01:09:05.532
there.

01:09:05.619 --> 01:09:07.230
What else?

01:09:07.534 --> 01:09:10.668
We need location, security and
any surprises along the way.

01:09:11.495 --> 01:09:13.714
Remember, if we
don't find Daisy,

01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:18.719
no one is ever
going to find you.

01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:21.592
Snip, snip.

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:26.597
Well, finally my bag's here.

01:09:26.684 --> 01:09:29.339
At least I can get outta
these nip clips and minis.

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:30.818
No offense, guys.

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:37.825
Okay, I never, like,
literally never thought

01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:40.741
I would ever utter
these words, but, Ryder,

01:09:40.828 --> 01:09:43.744
you're gonna need to lend
Ezra and me something to wear.

01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.311
No.

01:09:45.398 --> 01:09:46.704
With pleasure.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.968
All right, what about Koon,
what are we doing with him?

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:51.752
Well for now, he
stays locked away.

01:09:51.883 --> 01:09:53.798
No one will find him until
we decide the time is right.

01:09:53.885 --> 01:09:55.974
We could still
chop his dick off.

01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:58.542
Okay, ladies, let's
get the fuck out of here

01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:00.021
and go bring Daisy home.

01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:01.197
Let me guess.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.589
No, let me.

01:10:02.676 --> 01:10:03.895

Okay, according to
Koon, we're not far.

01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:01.387
The compound should be
just up over this ridge.

01:11:02.432 --> 01:11:04.521
Okay,
let's keep it moving.

01:11:09.047 --> 01:11:10.701
Diamond?

01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:20.493
Diamond?

01:11:55.136 --> 01:11:56.268
Jesus Christ.

01:11:57.835 --> 01:11:59.315
Diamond, what have you done?

01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:06.539
Multiple countries
have tried to bring you

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:08.498
and your family down for years.

01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:11.718
Millions of dollars
in resources spent,

01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:15.722
and it's gonna be
these three girls

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:18.595
who single-handedly
dismantle the Thai cartel mafia.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:22.860
How do you feel about that?

01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:49.147
Okay, you both
understand the plan?

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:52.455
I extract, you distract.

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.108
Daisy, we're coming for ya.

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:55.414
All right, let's move.

01:13:35.759 --> 01:13:38.544
Okay, Ryder's in.
Take your position.

01:13:38.631 --> 01:13:40.633
Make sure to be ready for us.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.114
We're gonna have to fucking
hightail it out of there.

01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:45.812
Diamond, I just want
you to know that I'm sorry.

01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:49.773
Ezra, let's just cross this
first bridge for Daisy, okay?

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.122
Okay.

01:14:35.775 --> 01:14:37.951
Okay, the charge is set.

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.780
Charge is set.

01:14:40.867 --> 01:14:42.347
Charge set.

01:15:46.498 --> 01:15:48.456
Finally, we meet.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:49.719
Fuck you.

01:15:49.806 --> 01:15:51.634
Spare the
impertinence, my darling.

01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:54.114
Now, where's Tok Koon?

01:15:54.201 --> 01:15:55.551
He's safe.

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.117
Safe?

01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:59.598
You think you're so
beautiful, so smart.

01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:01.469
You think you're a bunch
of American cowgirls,

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.776
you're gonna ride in
here and save the day?

01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:05.299
I don't think so.

01:16:05.386 --> 01:16:08.346
You know why?
Because you're nothing.

01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.565
You're fucking nothing.

01:16:12.698 --> 01:16:14.482
I would think
twice about that.

01:16:20.706 --> 01:16:22.578
I got the cocksucker.

01:16:32.936 --> 01:16:34.328
- Daisy!
- Ryder!

01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:38.071
Ryder!

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:29.470
Ryder!

01:17:31.124 --> 01:17:32.169
Ryder.

01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:33.823
Are you okay?

01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.128
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:36.303
I'm fine.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:37.827
And what did I tell you?

01:17:37.914 --> 01:17:39.742
I am a fucking badass.

01:17:39.829 --> 01:17:41.134
Yes, you are.

01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:43.789
Daisy, Daisy, I love you.

01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:46.096
I fucking love you, Ryder.

01:17:52.885 --> 01:17:55.671
Now let's get outta here.
Come on.

01:18:00.284 --> 01:18:02.678
We're taking our
friend, and once we do,

01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:04.854
Koon will be let
out of our custody.

01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:06.594
Why should I believe you?

01:18:06.725 --> 01:18:08.596
You will have double-crossed
the head of the cartel,

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:11.077
and you're gonna have a lot
more to be worried about

01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:13.950
than just three cowgirls.

01:18:14.037 --> 01:18:17.257
You may walk outta here
today, thinking you've won.

01:18:17.344 --> 01:18:18.824
You haven't.

01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:22.567
'Cause it's not about the ones
who are chasing behind you.

01:18:22.654 --> 01:18:25.570
It's about the ones who are
already there ahead of you.

01:18:25.657 --> 01:18:28.138
We're gonna find you, catch you,

01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:30.009
and we're gonna kill all of you.

01:18:30.096 --> 01:18:32.969
Revenge is gonna be sweet juice

01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:34.666
that I lick off
your dead bodies.

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.364
Drink this.

01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:40.411
You asshole.

01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:41.673
No!

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:46.983
Oh my God.
Thank God, you're okay.

01:18:47.070 --> 01:18:49.289
I'm fine. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

01:18:49.376 --> 01:18:50.638
Please tell me you've
done your last line.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.640
Good to see you too, Diamond.

01:18:53.293 --> 01:18:55.208
Diamond, no!

01:19:23.628 --> 01:19:24.672
Go, go, go!

01:19:40.688 --> 01:19:44.083
I was fucking shot.
Oh, fuck!

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:45.215
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:46.433
Just keep pressure
on your wound.

01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:48.261
Diamond, I'm really
sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:49.872
Screw it.

01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:53.049
After this, you can fuck
anyone you want in my family.

01:19:57.575 --> 01:19:59.098
Hasta la vista, bitches.

01:20:15.462 --> 01:20:17.029
Did they get Ryder?

01:20:17.116 --> 01:20:18.639
No, they didn't get Ryder.

01:20:18.726 --> 01:20:20.946
That was motherfucking Ryder!

01:20:28.911 --> 01:20:29.912
Okay, we're almost there.

01:20:29.999 --> 01:20:31.043
Almost where?

01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:34.351
God, we've got company.

01:20:45.057 --> 01:20:47.538
Daisy, it's time for
a little payback.

01:20:48.408 --> 01:20:50.454
Just release the
clip, aim and fire.

01:20:51.759 --> 01:20:53.370
You got this, D.

01:21:08.776 --> 01:21:10.126
Fuck yeah!

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.435
Oh, fuck it hurts!

01:21:15.696 --> 01:21:16.872
You're gonna be fine.
I promise you're gonna be fine.

01:21:16.959 --> 01:21:18.612
Just take it easy, okay.

01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:19.570
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:20.614
It's jammed!

01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:22.268
Hold tight, ladies.

01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:55.649
Ah.

01:21:58.174 --> 01:22:00.567
You almost fucking
got away with it.

01:22:00.654 --> 01:22:02.482
You almost rode off
into the sunset.

01:22:02.569 --> 01:22:04.658
And what makes you
think we haven't?

01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:06.660
Look around you, Cowgirl.

01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:09.446
Remember?
I warned you.

01:22:10.534 --> 01:22:12.014
You sure did.

01:22:16.496 --> 01:22:18.063
Yeehaw, motherfucker.

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.377
All right, everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.946
Get down!
Move! Get down!

01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:34.340
Stay down,
motherfucker!

01:23:17.166 --> 01:23:18.602
Ladies, welcome aboard.

01:23:18.776 --> 01:23:21.257
I'll be your pilot,
Jasper McDaniel. Hm-hm.

01:23:51.722 --> 01:23:56.335
Was this like the best
girls trip ever or what?

01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:58.555
Actually, yes.

01:23:58.642 --> 01:23:59.947
By the way, when
did the two of you

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.514
start munching on each other?

01:24:02.863 --> 01:24:03.995
Diamond, shut up.
They're cute.

01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:05.649
I mean, they might be in love.

01:24:06.432 --> 01:24:07.868
You're not wrong.

01:24:08.521 --> 01:24:10.480
Seriously, for
better or worse,

01:24:10.567 --> 01:24:12.134
this is the trip
I'll never forget.

01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:14.005
I mean, Ezra just
took a fucking bullet,

01:24:14.092 --> 01:24:16.573
repaired her broken
relationship with Diamond,

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.228
and Diamond for once in her
life has actually found someone

01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:20.533
she likes more than herself.

01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:25.147
And I, for once,
can be the real me.

01:24:29.238 --> 01:24:31.109
Allow me,
just a little toast.

01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:32.632
Yes.

01:24:34.547 --> 01:24:35.983
There we go.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.466
Ladies, to an inspiring
group of heroes.

01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:42.947
Heroes? Fuck that,
we are Sheroes.

01:24:44.035 --> 01:24:46.429
