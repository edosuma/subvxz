♪ ♪

00:20.246 --> 00:22.021
Look at us, walking to school.

00:22.172 --> 00:24.023
Walking so fast.
A little too fast.

00:24.174 --> 00:25.916
-Let's slow down.
-Thank you.

00:26.009 --> 00:28.268
Sorry, I'm just so excited to
be working at your school today.

00:28.437 --> 00:30.178
Helping out in the front office.

00:30.272 --> 00:32.514
Doing my once-a-year
parent volunteering.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.108
Once a year seems like one
too many times, if you ask me.

00:35.277 --> 00:36.760
It's important to help out.

00:36.853 --> 00:39.354
And also, they make you feel
really bad if you don't do it.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.281
But I like it.
Hanging out in the office,

00:41.375 --> 00:43.267
copying, stapling, officing.

00:43.285 --> 00:44.951
Hey, we should have
a little secret code

00:45.104 --> 00:46.270
to say hi to each other.

00:46.288 --> 00:47.713
-We could wave, like this.
-Okay.

00:47.940 --> 00:50.365
Very secret.
You sure you're not CIA?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.551
Ugh, I wish Mom could be
at school all the time.

00:52.778 --> 00:54.961
Wait, Mom, how many grades
would you have to flunk

00:55.056 --> 00:56.280
to be back in my grade?

00:56.298 --> 00:59.116
-I don't know. Thirty?
-Okay, get on it.

00:59.209 --> 01:00.893
Linda, good morning.

01:01.044 --> 01:02.544
Good morning to you, Ms. Selbo.

01:02.712 --> 01:05.122
Welcome back to
the nerve center of the school.

01:05.124 --> 01:07.066
Or nerd center,
with some of these kids.

01:07.217 --> 01:09.234
-Ha! Aw, nerds.
-Yeah.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.236
Anyway, today,
I would love your help

01:11.463 --> 01:13.146
-stuffing these envelopes.
-All right.

01:13.299 --> 01:15.315
-You need me to copy anything?
-No, that's okay.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.225
The last time
you volunteered here, you--

01:17.394 --> 01:19.319
Well, you're kind of
a hard button pusher.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.062
-(banging)
-Two. Zero. Copy.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.730
Yeah, they just popped
right off.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.065
-Those buttons.
-Not really.

01:24.234 --> 01:25.417
And, of course,
if you want any coffee

01:25.494 --> 01:27.235
from the teachers' lounge,
help yourself.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.329
Before Coach Blevins
fills up his

01:29.481 --> 01:31.590
"everybody look at me"
huge thermos.

01:31.741 --> 01:33.425
Ooh, teachers' lounge coffee.

01:33.502 --> 01:34.985
-Yum.
-Well...

01:35.078 --> 01:36.762
So yeah, I'm volunteering today.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.431
-That's great. I'm not.
-(laughs nervously)

01:39.658 --> 01:40.674
(humming)

01:40.843 --> 01:43.160
MS. SELBO: And you think
Louise Belcher stole it?

01:43.178 --> 01:44.436
-What?
-FROND: Yes, I do.

01:44.588 --> 01:47.514
I can't prove she stole the toy.
I just know she did.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.182
It's so Louise to take a--
what's it called?--

01:49.276 --> 01:51.610
the thingy you mash
and it shoots up like a missile.

01:51.761 --> 01:53.112
MS. SELBO:
A mash missile?

01:53.263 --> 01:55.930
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> My Louise, a thief?</i>
<i> Not my Louise.</i>

01:56.024 --> 01:59.267
<i> Maybe my Louise.</i>
<i> No, no. Not my Louise.</i>

01:59.436 --> 02:00.935
Well, I'm off to
my counseling seminar.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.028
It's on executive function.

02:02.181 --> 02:03.363
And it's a luncheon.

02:03.515 --> 02:04.939
It's an executive
function luncheon.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.867
-Gotcha.
-But when I'm back
this afternoon,

02:07.002 --> 02:09.444
I'll skillfully question Louise,
she'll confess,

02:09.463 --> 02:11.371
and then we can move on
with our lives.

02:11.523 --> 02:13.540
-What if she doesn't confess?
-She will 'cause she did it.

02:13.692 --> 02:15.300
And if she doesn't,
she still did it.

02:15.452 --> 02:17.043
'Cause I can't file away
this incident report

02:17.138 --> 02:18.453
until I have a name.

02:18.547 --> 02:20.472
Oh, and I put the incident
report in this thing.

02:20.624 --> 02:22.699
Did you know we had these?
With the little string?

02:22.718 --> 02:24.217
They're fun.

02:24.370 --> 02:25.960
Hey, Bob, I was
at the pie place,

02:26.054 --> 02:28.480
Just One of the Pies,
and they had a promotion

02:28.649 --> 02:30.056
where people put
their business card in a bowl,

02:30.151 --> 02:32.542
and then they pick one and
the winner gets a free lunch.

02:32.636 --> 02:34.211
-You should do that.
-Uh, yeah. Maybe.

02:34.229 --> 02:35.654
I could be the first to enter.

02:35.731 --> 02:38.882
Is this your business card
that you hand out to people?

02:38.884 --> 02:40.901
Yeah, I mean...
it's a little old.

02:41.053 --> 02:42.644
You don't like it?
What's the matter with it?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.905
Well, it says "The Handy Hubby."

02:45.057 --> 02:46.481
And "Hubby" is crossed out.

02:46.558 --> 02:49.226
-So it just says "The Handy."
-Yeah, well, I was married

02:49.244 --> 02:51.411
when I had those made,
then I wasn't.

02:51.563 --> 02:53.397
And-and also, I can't read
your phone number.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.915
Yeah, 'cause I changed
my phone number

02:55.009 --> 02:57.176
and I wrote in a new one,
but the pen was smudgy.

02:57.327 --> 02:59.178
You wrote your new number
on every card?

02:59.254 --> 03:00.754
Well, I'm not gonna
get them reprinted.

03:00.906 --> 03:02.163
We're not all millionaires, Bob.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.457
I mean, Teddy, I don't think
you want a card

03:04.609 --> 03:07.519
that says "The Handy" and then
a phone number written in pen.

03:07.671 --> 03:09.930
-It may be time
to get new cards.
-It is?

03:10.006 --> 03:11.932
I think they're not
expensive nowadays.

03:12.084 --> 03:13.341
You could probably do it online.

03:13.435 --> 03:14.842
Let's do it!
You got your laptop?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.178
Oh, I didn't know
I was gonna be involved.

03:17.272 --> 03:19.105
I need you, Bob.
I need your artistic eyes.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.532
Plus you can help me
not get hacked.

03:20.609 --> 03:22.609
-Why would you get hacked?
-I don't know.

03:22.761 --> 03:24.611
Oh, wait, it's your laptop.
You'd be getting hacked.

03:24.763 --> 03:27.539
-So, are you gonna go
get it, or what?
-Oh, my God.

03:27.691 --> 03:31.025
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Frond's already decided</i>
<i> Louise stole that kid's toy.</i>

03:31.045 --> 03:32.211
<i> But did she?</i>

03:32.362 --> 03:34.287
Mmm. That is a good-tasting
envelope.

03:34.364 --> 03:36.440
Psst. Hey, Mom.
Remember? Our code?

03:36.458 --> 03:38.475
-This means
I'm saying hi to you.
-Hi, Tina.

03:38.477 --> 03:40.293
I'm going to the nurse's office
for a Band-Aid.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.554
I scraped my knee.
Skirt life, am I right?

03:42.706 --> 03:43.964
Mm-hmm. Oh.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.057
-Uh, back in a sec.
-Okay.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.299
-(quietly): Tina.
-Yeah?

03:46.393 --> 03:47.951
Listen. I got a question
about Louise.

03:47.970 --> 03:49.286
-Hey, guys.
-(shushing)

03:49.304 --> 03:50.804
Shh. We're whispering
for some reason.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.898
Fun. Need anything
from the bathroom?

03:53.125 --> 03:54.215
Up-bup-bup. Hold on.

03:54.309 --> 03:55.883
I can give you maybe 30 seconds.

03:55.961 --> 03:58.478
Do you two know anything about
a mash missile getting stolen?

03:58.630 --> 04:00.964
Oh, yeah. Jason Jeffers'
Burobu mash missile.

04:00.983 --> 04:03.483
Wait, Burobu?
Like that thing Louise is into?

04:03.560 --> 04:05.302
I thought those were only
trading cards.

04:05.395 --> 04:06.745
I think they make
different toys, too.

04:06.896 --> 04:08.472
And they might have
their own line of salsa.

04:08.565 --> 04:11.083
Oh, boy.
Do you think Louise stole it?

04:11.234 --> 04:13.810
-What? No.
-Yeah. No, right?

04:13.829 --> 04:16.146
Yeah, probably not.
But, I mean...

04:16.164 --> 04:17.981
She is a mischievous
little minx.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.833
-Yeah.
-But no. Probably.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.075
So... you haven't,

04:21.095 --> 04:23.153
like, seen her with
a mash missile

04:23.171 --> 04:25.079
or hiding a mash missile
or anything?

04:25.099 --> 04:26.581
This is definitely
past 30 seconds.

04:26.675 --> 04:28.267
I mean, this morning,
Gene and I were with Louise

04:28.435 --> 04:29.935
at her locker,
and it was pretty empty.

04:30.086 --> 04:31.103
And so was her backpack.

04:31.254 --> 04:32.771
That's good, that's good.

04:32.922 --> 04:34.273
Her backpack was really empty.

04:34.424 --> 04:36.833
Like, man, fourth graders
do not get a lot of homework.

04:36.852 --> 04:38.760
-It's coming, fourth graders.
It's coming.
-(groaning softly)

04:38.854 --> 04:41.855
-Okay. Kids, go. Gene, go.
-I already did a little.

04:42.007 --> 04:43.356
Knock, knock.

04:43.509 --> 04:45.600
Hi. I need to borrow
Louise a sec.

04:45.694 --> 04:48.361
I just need to give her
her... lucky pencil.

04:48.514 --> 04:50.514
You don't have to talk
about it this much.

04:50.607 --> 04:52.849
Let's see this
quote, unquote lucky pencil.

04:52.942 --> 04:54.200
Listen, I don't know

04:54.353 --> 04:55.852
how else to ask this,
so I'm just gonna ask.

04:55.945 --> 04:58.204
Jason Jeffers' Burobu
mash missile that went missing.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.132
-You didn't take it, did you?
-What? No.

05:00.283 --> 05:01.358
-You're sure?
-Yes.

05:01.451 --> 05:03.302
Okay. Then I... believe you.

05:03.453 --> 05:05.362
Well, you should believe me.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.638
I'm also slightly hurt
you'd think

05:06.790 --> 05:08.456
I'd do that in the first place.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.550
I mean, I'm a spunky kid,
but a thief? No, ma'am.

05:10.702 --> 05:13.645
I know, I know.
And I was also a spunky kid.

05:13.722 --> 05:16.890
I, uh, borrowed stuff
from stores, you know?

05:16.984 --> 05:18.317
I set a few fires, I get it.

05:18.544 --> 05:21.545
-Geez, Mom.
-Not big fires. Just small ones.

05:21.563 --> 05:23.380
Well, one got big.
But it started small.

05:23.473 --> 05:25.991
The point is, I understand.
You can tell me if you did it.

05:26.218 --> 05:27.717
Mom. I'm telling you
I didn't do it.

05:27.736 --> 05:30.070
Even though it was Burobu,
your favorite thing.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.313
Yeah, I love Burobu. Cards.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.407
But the Burobu mash missile
is duh-umb.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.243
It has nothing to do with
the cards or the world.

05:37.396 --> 05:39.412
Right. Okay.
Too dumb for you to steal.

05:39.565 --> 05:41.656
Wait, why are you
asking me this, Mom?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.233
Does someone think I did it?

05:43.326 --> 05:46.327
No. No. No. No. No.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.213
Okay, you just said "no"
so many times.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.240
-I love you. Goodbye.
-Hey, you're pushing.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.926
-You're pushing
-Go, go-- Hi! She's back.

05:53.078 --> 05:54.519
<i> So Louise is innocent.</i>

05:54.671 --> 05:57.414
<i> But Mr. Frond is gonna try</i>
<i> and pin it on her anyway.</i>

05:57.507 --> 05:59.340
<i> Unless...</i>
<i> I can prove she's innocent</i>

05:59.434 --> 06:01.175
<i> before Mr. Frond comes back.</i>

06:01.269 --> 06:02.602
Okay. Yeah, that could work.

06:02.754 --> 06:04.696
-You can do this.
-Thank you
for the encouragement.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.111
BOB:
So, Mr. Frond thinks Louise
stole the mash missile thing?

06:11.263 --> 06:12.429
-Yeah.
<i> -BOB: But she didn't.</i>

06:12.447 --> 06:13.521
And I'm gonna prove it.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.265
Right. You keep saying that
like that.

06:15.283 --> 06:16.875
But also,
it's definitely something

06:17.026 --> 06:18.543
she could have done, right?

06:18.695 --> 06:19.769
No.

06:19.863 --> 06:20.879
I mean, maybe?

06:21.030 --> 06:22.956
Oh, definitely maybe. But no.

06:23.108 --> 06:25.291
You said it was a Burobu thing,
right? She loves Burobu.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.277
Yeah, but she doesn't like
this Burobu thing.

06:27.295 --> 06:28.553
And Tina and Gene said

06:28.780 --> 06:30.447
that the mash missile
wasn't in her locker.

06:30.465 --> 06:32.449
And it wasn't in her backpack,
Mr. Quick to Judge.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.134
You know, we're lucky
I'm working here today.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.952
I can crack the case
from the inside.

06:35.971 --> 06:38.730
<i> -Um...</i>
-Now I just need
to get rid of Ms. Selbo.

06:38.849 --> 06:39.898
That doesn't sound good.

06:40.216 --> 06:42.308
Shh. It's fine. Love you.
We never spoke. Goodbye.

06:42.461 --> 06:44.310
Back from
the teachers' lounge again.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.296
Mmm, coffee, right? So brown.

06:46.389 --> 06:47.964
You sure are staying
caffeinated.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.408
Yeah, um, to be honest,

06:49.635 --> 06:52.244
Ms. Selbo, you're looking
a little groggy.

06:52.395 --> 06:54.562
-Oh. That's fun to hear.
-Yeah.

06:54.731 --> 06:57.307
I guess I could use
some terrible coffee.

06:57.325 --> 06:59.066
Mm-hmm.
I'll-I'll watch your desk.

06:59.161 --> 07:01.161
-Okay.
-No rush. Take your time.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.813
Drink it there.
It's a nice atmosphere.

07:03.982 --> 07:06.091
-Is it?
-Uh-huh. (tittering)

07:07.261 --> 07:08.818
Oh, this is a good envelope.

07:08.837 --> 07:12.914
"Burobu mash missile belonging
to Jason Jeffers..." Mm.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.175
"Last Tuesday, recess,
on the grass,

07:15.327 --> 07:16.768
put it down and it was gone."

07:16.920 --> 07:18.103
-GENE: Hey, Mom.
-Ah!

07:18.330 --> 07:19.271
I just found something
I wanted to give you.

07:19.422 --> 07:21.255
-Okay, what?
-(blowing kiss)

07:21.349 --> 07:23.275
Yeah, yeah. You, too.
"Possible suspects--

07:23.502 --> 07:26.019
parentheses--
the usual baddies."

07:26.113 --> 07:27.428
Some names.

07:27.506 --> 07:29.506
"Louise hearts Burobu
equals Louise did it."

07:29.599 --> 07:32.099
-Unbelievable.
-Ooh, that's gritty.

07:32.194 --> 07:33.768
-Gritty coffee.
-Crap.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.680
Oh, no (grunting)

07:36.773 --> 07:38.272
And stuff. And st--

07:38.292 --> 07:40.183
Oh, stuff. Oh, hey, you're back.

07:40.185 --> 07:42.294
Yup. Am I perky enough
for you now?

07:42.445 --> 07:43.369
Yeah, sure.

07:43.522 --> 07:45.446
<i> Okay, I've got some suspects.</i>

07:45.540 --> 07:46.965
<i> I need to start</i>
<i> eliminating some names.</i>

07:47.042 --> 07:48.300
<i> How do I do that?</i>

07:48.527 --> 07:49.468
Oh! Ms. Selbo?

07:49.619 --> 07:51.118
You know what I've always
wanted to see?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.379
Uh, the list of
who's absent and when.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.639
You want to see that?

07:54.791 --> 07:57.367
Yeah. I love all that
behind-the-scenes stuff.

07:57.460 --> 08:00.537
-This? Y-You want to see this?
-Yeah. Wow.

08:00.630 --> 08:03.464
There's that name.
And there's that name.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.483
So interesting.

08:04.634 --> 08:06.376
You're kind of
bumming me out, Linda.

08:06.394 --> 08:09.470
Have you never seen
interesting things before?

08:09.490 --> 08:10.638
Oh, this looks easy.

08:10.732 --> 08:13.325
Just got to type in my info.
Ugh, my name.

08:13.476 --> 08:15.142
I don't have
a good business card name.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.495
What do you mean
"good business card name"?

08:16.663 --> 08:19.313
You got a great business
card name. Bob Burger?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.907
It's not Bob--
(sighs) Oh, my God.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.075
Do you want to change your name?

08:22.227 --> 08:23.502
I don't know.

08:23.653 --> 08:25.245
I bet I'd get more business
if my name was, like,

08:25.397 --> 08:27.488
-Jim Thunder or something.
-I'd hire Jim Thunder.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.175
Maybe not to do my taxes.
Or do heart surgery.

08:30.326 --> 08:31.901
-But anything else.
-BOB: Mmm.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.662
Although, would Jim Thunder be
a handyman or something cooler?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.664
Like a bounty hunter.
So maybe I could be

08:36.683 --> 08:38.499
-Jim Thunder Bounty Hunter.
-(cell phone buzzing)

08:38.519 --> 08:39.851
-I don't see why not.
-Hi, Lin.

08:40.078 --> 08:42.503
The kids on Frond's incident
report that aren't Louise,

08:42.523 --> 08:44.581
they were either absent
or they have an alibi.

08:44.599 --> 08:46.599
You're allowed to look
at the incident report?

08:46.752 --> 08:48.360
Probably not.
But one kid was out sick,

08:48.436 --> 08:51.178
one kid was at a club meeting,
another kid had a sports thing.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.438
What? How do you know all that?

08:52.591 --> 08:53.439
It's all written down.

08:53.592 --> 08:55.258
Also, if Ms. Selbo
ever asks you,

08:55.277 --> 08:57.202
I really love filing systems
and lists of names.

08:57.353 --> 08:59.704
<i> -Okay...</i>
-I'm at a dead end here, Bob.

08:59.856 --> 09:02.782
Well, maybe it's somebody else
that liked Burobu?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.267
Or... it's Louise.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.785
Yes. Right, good idea.

09:05.937 --> 09:07.453
Not Louise. But yes.
Burobu people.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.530
Okay, I got to go
save our kid. Bye.

09:09.624 --> 09:11.866
All right, bye.
I'm doing important stuff, too.

09:12.702 --> 09:14.719
Slow, no bouncies,
please and thank you.

09:14.946 --> 09:16.388
(groans)
Got all of that one.

09:16.539 --> 09:18.114
-Attaboy, Rudes!
-(Rudy panting)

09:18.133 --> 09:20.392
Hi, kids.
Uh, Louise, let's, uh, talk.

09:20.543 --> 09:22.677
-Okay.
-Listen, I've been
trying to clear you,

09:22.788 --> 09:25.212
but all I'm finding is
kids with perfect alibis.

09:25.307 --> 09:26.398
Who else likes Burobu?

09:26.625 --> 09:28.215
Mom, you're asking
the wrong question.

09:28.310 --> 09:30.794
The mash missile is
offensive to Burobu fans.

09:30.854 --> 09:31.811
We hate that thing.

09:31.963 --> 09:34.221
Oh. Maybe a Burobu kid
destroyed it.

09:34.316 --> 09:36.800
Maybe they didn't want it.
They wanted to murder it.

09:36.968 --> 09:38.651
I don't know, man.
I can't think of anyone

09:38.804 --> 09:41.137
who would want to waste
their time on that cheap,

09:41.230 --> 09:42.897
stupid, sticky,
stinking hunk o' junk.

09:42.974 --> 09:45.141
-COACH BLEVINS: Louise,
you're up.
-Mom, I got to go.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.752
I have a ball to kick.
Also, I'm innocent, by the way.

09:47.904 --> 09:49.312
Oh, yeah, that is a big thermos.

09:49.331 --> 09:52.073
-What?
-Oh, nothing. Play balls!

09:52.167 --> 09:53.650
Eh, so many options.

09:53.743 --> 09:56.261
Yeah, I want to say, too many?
You know what?

09:56.430 --> 09:57.821
A mechanic gave me a card
one time.

09:57.839 --> 10:00.006
He was not a good mechanic,
but the card was great.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.583
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I think I'm gonna go get it.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.661
Okay, you want to teach me
how to cook

10:04.663 --> 10:06.253
-in case someone comes in?
-What? No.

10:06.348 --> 10:07.755
But if they say
they need food right now,

10:07.924 --> 10:09.924
-I'll go in there
and give it a shot?
-Teddy, no.

10:10.093 --> 10:11.960
Might as well give me
your apron, just in case.

10:12.095 --> 10:13.111
No. No, thank you.

10:13.262 --> 10:15.971
Ha. Got it. Mm-hmm.

10:15.973 --> 10:17.115
Hmm.

10:17.266 --> 10:18.432
Tina and Gene said
the mash missile

10:18.452 --> 10:19.767
wasn't in her locker.

10:19.861 --> 10:21.861
And it wasn't in her backpack,
Mr. Quick to Judge.

10:22.013 --> 10:23.029
<i> (Linda's voice echoing)</i>

10:23.181 --> 10:24.939
I mean, I guess
I could just peek

10:25.033 --> 10:26.607
in Louise's room since I'm here.

10:26.627 --> 10:30.945
Just tilting the door open.
Not even going in.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.446
Maybe going in a step or two.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.634
Please don't let darts
hit me in the face. Huh.

10:35.710 --> 10:38.285
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Okay, checking out</i>
<i> the incident report again.</i>

10:38.454 --> 10:39.545
Stuff, stuff, stuff.

10:42.534 --> 10:44.534

11:01.828 --> 11:03.644
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> How would she know</i>
<i> the toy was sticky?</i>

11:03.738 --> 11:05.238
-(gasps) Hi, Bob.
-Hey.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.998
So, the thing that went missing
was a Burobu

11:07.075 --> 11:08.315
-mash missile, right?
-Yeah.

11:08.484 --> 11:10.243
Well, I went into Louise's room.

11:10.395 --> 11:12.078
Did a giant ball roll down
and crush you?

11:12.230 --> 11:13.897
Surprisingly, no.

11:13.899 --> 11:15.415
<i> But on her desk was</i>
<i> a</i> Burobu Magazine,

11:15.509 --> 11:16.824
<i> and the one page</i>

11:16.902 --> 11:18.401
that was dog-eared in it

11:18.494 --> 11:19.569
<i> had a picture of</i>
<i> the Burobu mash missile.</i>

11:19.587 --> 11:21.829
Oh, crap.
And she said "sticky" to me.

11:21.907 --> 11:23.239
-Huh?
-It's a long story,

11:23.332 --> 11:25.091
-but it's bad news for Louise.
-BOTH: Crap.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.352
Hey, did you ask Linda about
the whole Jim Thunder thing?

11:27.429 --> 11:29.354
You're not a Jim Thunder, Teddy.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.009
-Crap. Crap. Crap.
-Oh, no, Linda, what's wrong?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.861
Uh, that was my husband.

11:37.013 --> 11:39.422
His... hat fell off.

11:39.441 --> 11:41.941
-Oh.
-Yeah. Husbands with their hats.

11:42.093 --> 11:43.201
Stay single, I say.

11:43.394 --> 11:45.595
Well, then.
I'm gonna eat my leftover soup.

11:45.613 --> 11:48.431
-Aw.
-It's not sad.
It's just my lunch.

11:48.524 --> 11:50.283
Oh, is it lunchtime?
For the kids, too?

11:50.452 --> 11:51.567
It is.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.360
They need to eat every day,
as it turns out.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.863
Be right back. Enjoy your
not sad leftover soup.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.031
It's just regular soup.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.125
-Hey, kids.
-Oh, hey, Mom.

11:59.294 --> 12:01.611
I have been saving
this seat for you for years.

12:01.704 --> 12:04.113
Would you guys mind
if I spoke to Louise privately?

12:04.132 --> 12:05.782
-Okay.
-(Gene and Tina grunt)

12:05.800 --> 12:06.966
-Is this good?
-A little more.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.451
-(grunts)
-She's here one day.

12:08.470 --> 12:09.619
Louise, look.

12:09.712 --> 12:11.287
Now would be a good time
to tell me the truth

12:11.380 --> 12:12.622
about taking the mash missile.

12:12.640 --> 12:13.565
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom.

12:13.716 --> 12:15.308
Why am I still being
accused of this?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.310
And also, I told you the truth.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.886
And you can tell it's the truth
because it's the truth.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.889
Well, why'd you fold over
the page in your<i> Burobu Magazine</i>

12:21.908 --> 12:23.149
with the mash missile on it?

12:23.301 --> 12:24.892
Wait, how do you know
about that?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.060
Did you search my room?

12:26.137 --> 12:27.971
-No. Your father did.
-What?

12:28.064 --> 12:29.581
-Did he get booby-trapped?
-He didn't, actually.

12:29.808 --> 12:31.416
-Must've been a malfunction.
-Wait a minute.

12:31.643 --> 12:33.810
-This is a private conversation.
-Sorry, sorry.

12:33.828 --> 12:35.253
-(both grunting)
-First of all,

12:35.404 --> 12:36.829
I'm between booby traps
right now.

12:36.982 --> 12:37.981
Second of all,

12:38.074 --> 12:39.332
I folded that page
because of an ad

12:39.426 --> 12:41.484
for the special Slug-i-cane
collector's pack.

12:41.503 --> 12:42.761
Not because of a mash missile,

12:42.988 --> 12:44.578
which I keep telling you
I didn't steal.

12:44.598 --> 12:47.265
It's getting less private,
with all the shouting.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.158
I think we're running out
of table here.

12:49.177 --> 12:50.602
-I'm half-cheeking it.
-Okay, well.

12:50.753 --> 12:53.679
When you were in PE, you said
the mash missile was sticky.

12:53.832 --> 12:55.515
Jason Jeffers ate a
peanut butter and honey sandwich

12:55.667 --> 12:57.500
before he took the toy
out of his locker.

12:57.519 --> 12:59.760
How would you know if it was
sticky unless you took it?

12:59.854 --> 13:01.595
Because his hands are
always sticky.

13:01.764 --> 13:03.172
That's his thing.

13:03.341 --> 13:05.191
Kids in our class literally
call him Sticky Sticky Jason.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.785
Louise, I can't tell
if you're lying to me,

13:06.936 --> 13:09.862
because now I'm realizing
you are really good at lying,

13:09.956 --> 13:11.105
better than I thought,

13:11.199 --> 13:12.348
and I thought you were
pretty good at it.

13:12.441 --> 13:14.017
Okay, I think we're done here.

13:14.019 --> 13:15.351
Tina, Gene, storm off with me?

13:15.370 --> 13:16.795
-Oh. Um...
-I mean, I was done anyway.

13:16.946 --> 13:19.297
Would the last few bites of
my mac 'n' cheese cheer you up?

13:19.524 --> 13:21.190
No. Yeah, maybe.

13:21.284 --> 13:23.468
Hi, Mrs. Belcher.
Mac 'n' cheesing it, huh?

13:23.619 --> 13:24.544
Uh-huh.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.471
Everything okay?
You look kind of down.

13:26.698 --> 13:27.639
Or maybe you're just
looking down

13:27.790 --> 13:29.307
-'cause I'm shorter than you.
-(sighs)

13:29.458 --> 13:30.867
They think Louise stole
the mash missile thing.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.369
-Oh, my.
-But she's a good girl, right?

13:33.371 --> 13:35.221
I mean, she's complicated.

13:35.373 --> 13:37.482
It's just if she took it,
I don't know where she put it.

13:37.633 --> 13:38.799
It's not in her room,

13:38.893 --> 13:40.301
and Tina and Gene said
it's not in her backpack

13:40.395 --> 13:41.894
-or her locker.
-Which locker?

13:42.047 --> 13:43.896
-What do you mean?
-Louise has two lockers.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.323
Louise has two lockers?

13:45.474 --> 13:47.158
Yeah, her regular one,
and then her Rudyville locker.

13:47.385 --> 13:48.827
She calls it that
because it's near mine.

13:48.978 --> 13:50.144
Number 158, I want to say?

13:50.238 --> 13:51.478
-(bell ringing)
-Ooh, I got to go.

13:51.573 --> 13:54.148
Louise, you sneaky
double-locker-haver.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.892
TEDDY:
It's okay.

13:55.910 --> 13:56.909
You built it up too much, maybe.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.061
No. It's nice.

13:58.079 --> 13:59.320
It's clean, simple.

13:59.414 --> 14:01.064
-Who wants simple?
-Everybody?

14:01.082 --> 14:02.415
No. You know
what I get from this?

14:02.567 --> 14:04.250
"I'm a boring mechanic,
and I'm dead inside."

14:04.402 --> 14:05.735
You don't get that from this.

14:05.753 --> 14:08.346

<i> LINDA:</i>
<i>Mr. Frond's gonna be back soon.</i>

14:58.139 --> 15:00.806
<i> I got to get inside Louise's</i>
<i> second secret locker.</i>

15:00.901 --> 15:02.216
<i> But how do I do that?</i>

15:02.235 --> 15:04.093
<i> Do I get a crowbar?</i>
<i> Or some dynamite?</i>

15:04.095 --> 15:05.570
<i> Oh. Or I look in there.</i>

15:05.797 --> 15:07.888
Uh, Ms. Selbo, did you know,

15:07.908 --> 15:10.241
uh, they're giving out
free batteries?

15:10.468 --> 15:12.635
In the teachers' lounge?
Uh, right now.

15:12.728 --> 15:13.745
-Batteries?
-Yup.

15:13.896 --> 15:16.155
Double-A, triple-A's,
double-D's.

15:16.307 --> 15:17.564
<i> She's buying it.</i>

15:17.584 --> 15:19.809
Seems like an odd thing
to be giving away

15:19.811 --> 15:21.068
in the teachers' lounge.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.161
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Oh, crap. She's not buying it.</i>

15:22.313 --> 15:23.646
Um, did I say batteries?

15:23.665 --> 15:26.482
I meant, uh, gift cards
for, uh, places you like.

15:26.484 --> 15:30.169
That doesn't make any sense,
but I do have to pee.

15:30.321 --> 15:32.413
Of course you do.
All that coffee?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.082
-Take your time.
-I will. Thank you, Linda.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.353
I love...
that we use volunteers.

15:40.423 --> 15:41.940
(mumbling)

15:42.167 --> 15:43.499
One-- 158!

15:43.592 --> 15:45.501
Huh. Don't be in Louise's
secret locker.

15:45.594 --> 15:47.278
Don't be in
Louise's secret locker.

15:47.430 --> 15:48.262
Oh, nuts.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.031
Louise, no. Oh, my face!

15:53.119 --> 15:55.511
-No, no, no, no.
-LOUISE: Mom?

15:55.530 --> 15:57.438
-What are you doing?
-Ah! What are you doing?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.032
Going to the bathroom.
Oh, my God.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.608
Louise, you lied to me.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.444
Oh, my Louise. Oh, my baby.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.688
What if you get suspended?
You're branded.

16:05.707 --> 16:07.448
It'll follow you everywhere.
You'll never be president.

16:07.525 --> 16:09.875
-What? Wait, what?
-Mama's gonna help you.

16:10.044 --> 16:11.210
No one's gonna know you took it

16:11.362 --> 16:12.453
and hid it
in your secret locker.

16:12.514 --> 16:14.138
I mean, yeah,
it was my secret locker.

16:14.365 --> 16:15.456
I don't use it anymore.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.383
I want to believe you,
but I don't

16:17.535 --> 16:19.368
because you're so good at lying,
so I am gonna eat it.

16:19.462 --> 16:20.979
That's what I'll do.
I'll eat it.

16:21.206 --> 16:22.463
-Ooh. Sticky.
-Mom. Mom.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.465
(shushing) Mama's here.
Mama's gonna help you.

16:24.633 --> 16:27.210
The executive function luncheon
wasn't much of luncheon.

16:27.228 --> 16:29.320
Assorted melon and hummus
is not lunch.

16:29.472 --> 16:30.637
(gasps)
Put it back, put it back.

16:30.732 --> 16:33.307
(sighs) Someone wrote
"fart" on this locker.

16:33.476 --> 16:36.235
-Yup. They do that.
-Let me see if that'll wipe off.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.312
-(all gasping)
-That's on there for good.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.314
Linda. Louise. What's going on?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.815
Louise, why aren't you in class?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.409
-I was going to the bathroom...
-I was just taking

16:43.561 --> 16:45.228
-a little walk.
-...and then I saw my mom--

16:45.321 --> 16:46.729
Phillip, I forgot.
Your mom called.

16:46.748 --> 16:50.324
She, uh, really wanted to
talk to you about... vitamins.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.734
(groans) Of course.

16:51.827 --> 16:55.013
That's all we talk about.
I guess I'll go call her back.

16:55.164 --> 16:56.347
I don't understand.

16:56.499 --> 16:58.016
-Why would you--?
-Follow me.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.500
(lock clicks)

16:59.519 --> 17:00.667
Why didn't you bust us?

17:00.836 --> 17:02.245
Even though
I'm totally innocent.

17:02.263 --> 17:03.337
Right, right. Super innocent.

17:03.431 --> 17:04.838
-No, I know.
-You know what?

17:04.858 --> 17:08.251
That Louise is innocent,
because I took the mash missile.

17:08.344 --> 17:09.510
-You took it?
-Why?

17:09.604 --> 17:11.420
I was at my nephew's
birthday party,

17:11.514 --> 17:14.757
and my nephew got that exact
same Burobu mash missile.

17:14.776 --> 17:16.259
<i> Not from me.</i>
<i> I-I got him a scented candle.</i>

17:16.427 --> 17:17.610
<i> That's a good present, right?</i>

17:17.762 --> 17:19.762
<i> -LINDA: Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i> -LOUISE: Eh, sure.</i>

17:19.781 --> 17:21.355
<i> SELBO:</i>
<i> But there is something wrong</i>
<i> with those mash missiles</i>

17:21.449 --> 17:23.023
<i> because kid after kid got hit</i>

17:23.043 --> 17:24.617
<i> in the butter beans</i>
<i> by that thing.</i>

17:24.769 --> 17:26.860
Okay, that toy's actually
starting to sound pretty fun.

17:27.029 --> 17:28.454
<i> SELBO:</i>
<i> Then, a couple days later,</i>
<i> I'm playing solitaire</i>

17:28.548 --> 17:30.456
<i> on an absolute heater,</i>
<i> when I hear</i>

17:30.608 --> 17:32.942
<i> Jason in the hall showing off</i>
<i> his new mash missile.</i>

17:33.111 --> 17:34.293
<i> I tried to warn him about it,</i>

17:34.445 --> 17:35.945
<i> and he said it was just</i>
<i> for show and tell.</i>

17:35.963 --> 17:37.797
<i> He wasn't gonna launch it.</i>
<i> But then later,</i>

17:37.965 --> 17:39.540
<i> that little punk</i>
<i> brought it to recess</i>

17:39.634 --> 17:41.300
<i> and went to gather</i>
<i> a bunch of kids.</i>

17:41.394 --> 17:43.286
<i> I was gonna yell at them</i>
<i> a little bit.</i>

17:43.304 --> 17:44.562
<i>I'm allowed to yell at the kids.</i>

17:44.789 --> 17:46.622
<i> But I broke it.</i>
<i> I sort of stepped on it.</i>

17:46.641 --> 17:48.791
<i> I might have been pumped up</i>
<i> about the yelling.</i>

17:48.810 --> 17:51.218
<i>And I thought, "He's gonna think</i>
<i> I did it on purpose,"</i>

17:51.237 --> 17:52.236
<i> so I hid it under my shirt.</i>

17:52.463 --> 17:54.572
<i> And I ran, Linda. I ran.</i>

17:54.723 --> 17:57.391
And I was like, "I just
stole a toy from a child."

17:57.485 --> 18:00.244
<i> I panicked and hid it</i>
<i> in an unassigned locker.</i>

18:00.396 --> 18:01.821
And you were just gonna
let me fry for this?

18:01.973 --> 18:03.973
No, I was gonna
move it somewhere...

18:04.066 --> 18:05.566
that I haven't figured out yet.

18:05.660 --> 18:07.401
Or make it explode? Somehow?

18:07.495 --> 18:09.087
Well, it's nice you didn't want
the kids' butter beans

18:09.238 --> 18:10.404
to get hurt, Ms. Selbo,

18:10.423 --> 18:11.923
but you got to come clean
to Mr. Frond.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.983
Hell no. I will lose my job.

18:14.076 --> 18:17.077
And I really like having a job.
They pay me money.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.171
It's somewhere to go
during the day.

18:19.248 --> 18:20.914
Wait, what if
we convinced Mr. Frond

18:20.934 --> 18:22.325
that there wasn't a crime?

18:22.343 --> 18:24.176
Because if there's no crime,
then there's no time.

18:24.253 --> 18:26.587
-I like it, I like it.
-But I broke it.

18:26.681 --> 18:27.997
Actually, it's not broken.

18:28.015 --> 18:29.849
It's just really,
really cheap and awful.

18:30.001 --> 18:33.836
Look, you just got to
click this in there.

18:33.855 --> 18:36.614
Louise, look at you.
You little non-thieving smartie.

18:36.765 --> 18:37.857
I know.

18:38.009 --> 18:40.343
Okay, I am liking this mock-up.

18:40.436 --> 18:41.677
The little hammers,
all around the outside.

18:41.770 --> 18:44.622
The cups-to-ounces
conversion chart on the back.

18:44.773 --> 18:46.290
The tic-tac-toe board
on the front.

18:46.517 --> 18:48.942
Yup. All the ideas are there.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.444
They-they all made it on there.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.321
You don't think
it's too much, do you?

18:52.373 --> 18:54.206
I do. I thought
I made it very clear

18:54.359 --> 18:55.524
that I think it's way too much.

18:55.618 --> 18:57.618
Maybe you just don't
have an artistic eye.

18:57.712 --> 19:00.138
You said you needed my artis--
You know what? Never mind.

19:00.214 --> 19:01.955
Plus a handyman does
a lot of stuff.

19:02.049 --> 19:03.457
So I need a lot of stuff.

19:03.626 --> 19:05.885
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
I'm looking for a handyman.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.386
I'd love to take
one of your cards.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.539
Oh, no! This is my disgusting
old card that I hate now.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.708
Here, uh...
imagine all this on here.

19:12.768 --> 19:14.543
Or do you want to take
a picture of the screen?

19:14.562 --> 19:17.563
(chuckles) Yeah, that's great.
I'll call you.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.489
See, Bob?

19:18.716 --> 19:20.158
Ugh. Everyone is awful.

19:20.385 --> 19:22.309
Bob, I think I know
what's going on here.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.829
You want to make your own card,
put Bob Burger on it.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.056
I mean, a little.
Not that name.

19:27.149 --> 19:28.557
Well, if I buy 500 of mine,

19:28.576 --> 19:31.151
I get a discount
on the next 500. Eh?

19:31.171 --> 19:33.337
-Uh, okay.
-Ooh. Look at that cactus.

19:33.564 --> 19:35.581
-That'd be good
for a guy who sells--
-(shushing)

19:35.733 --> 19:37.008
Yeah, it was in his locker.

19:37.235 --> 19:38.918
Right in his locker.
The whole time.

19:39.070 --> 19:40.327
Isn't that right, Jason?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.254
No. I took it out of my locker.

19:42.407 --> 19:44.015
Did you?
'Cause it was right there.

19:44.166 --> 19:47.018
Yeah, Jason, you think someone
knew your combination,

19:47.245 --> 19:48.686
opened your locker
and put it in there?

19:48.837 --> 19:51.004
'Cause the only people
who could do that are myself

19:51.024 --> 19:54.433
and Ms. Selbo, and why on earth
would we do such a thing?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.602
-Yeah.
-Jason, don't touch that. Ew.

19:56.679 --> 19:59.513
And now there's jelly
on Unpopular Parker.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.681
Well, well, well.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.608
Does someone owe someone else

20:02.760 --> 20:04.427
and their volunteer mother
an apology?

20:04.520 --> 20:07.112
-Yeah. Mr. Frond does. Oh.
-FROND: Sorry...

20:07.265 --> 20:08.948
-I accused--
-(bell ringing)

20:09.042 --> 20:10.266
Oh, oh. There's the bell.

20:10.284 --> 20:11.358
Bye-bye. Everyone go now.

20:11.452 --> 20:14.027
Well, at least
I didn't get fired.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.438
That's good. For me.

20:15.456 --> 20:17.215
And I didn't do time
for a crime I didn't commit.

20:17.366 --> 20:19.124
Can save the time
for my real crimes.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.219
-Just kidding.
-Uh-oh. End of the day.

20:21.370 --> 20:23.203
I might not have stuffed some,

20:23.297 --> 20:25.281
or most,
or any of the envelopes.

20:25.299 --> 20:26.373
No, you did not.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.784
Louise, I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

20:28.803 --> 20:30.970
And then believed you.
And then didn't believe you.

20:31.122 --> 20:32.471
It's okay.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.623
You made up for it by how far
you would have gone for me.

20:34.717 --> 20:35.958
Which does make me wonder

20:36.051 --> 20:37.626
how big of a crime
you'd commit for your kids.

20:37.645 --> 20:41.221
-Should we test it out?
-Yeah. Let's do insider trading.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.798
-No.
-Outsider trading?

20:42.933 --> 20:44.242
-Okay.
