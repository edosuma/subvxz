00:52.367 --> 00:55.100
SO, COME ON,
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

00:56.834 --> 01:00.467
SHAPELY.
SHAPELY'S GOOD.

01:00.467 --> 01:02.334
SHE'S IN THE SAME TRAIN
AS YOU EVERY MORNING,

01:02.334 --> 01:03.467
AND SHE'S SHAPELY.

01:03.467 --> 01:07.934
IT'S LIKE URSULA ANDRESS
AND PAMELA ANDERSON

01:07.934 --> 01:09.434
HAD A BABY.

01:09.434 --> 01:13.934
THE WORDS "LONG SHOT"
SOMEHOW SUGGEST THEMSELVES.

01:13.934 --> 01:15.534
PREMIUM SHAPELY--

01:15.534 --> 01:17.767
TOP-LEVEL, QUALITY SHAPELY.

01:17.767 --> 01:20.067
NOTHING WRONG
WITH SHAPELY.

01:20.067 --> 01:22.934
AND LONG.

01:22.934 --> 01:24.634
LONG?

01:24.634 --> 01:27.200
USUALLY WITH A RED SHOE.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.200
SO, LONG, SHAPELY,
WITH A RED SHOE?

01:29.200 --> 01:30.267
YEAH.

01:30.267 --> 01:31.767
JEFF?

01:31.767 --> 01:34.234
ARE YOU DESCRIBING A LEG?

01:36.033 --> 01:37.801
I'VE ONLY SEEN HER LEG.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.067
SHE GETS ON THE TRAIN
WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE,

01:42.067 --> 01:43.601
AND I NEVER SEE HER FACE.

01:43.601 --> 01:47.634
AND THEN SHE SITS DIAGONALLY
IN FRONT OF ME.

01:47.634 --> 01:50.234
I CAN ONLY SEE HER LEG.

01:50.234 --> 01:53.200
YOU'VE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH JUST A LEG?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.701
IT'S A GREAT LEG. 

01:55.701 --> 01:57.033
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS LEG.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.334
LEFT OR RIGHT?

02:00.868 --> 02:02.167
WHAT?

02:02.167 --> 02:04.000
IT'S A LEG--
WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO ASK?

02:05.234 --> 02:06.234
LEFT.

02:06.234 --> 02:08.767
NICE.

02:10.467 --> 02:11.601
AND BRUNETTE.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.200
BRUNETTE?

02:16.200 --> 02:19.267
I SAW THE BACK
OF HER HEAD ONCE.

02:19.267 --> 02:20.567
HOW WAS IT?

02:20.567 --> 02:22.534
PERT.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.501
SHE HAS A PERT HEAD?

02:25.501 --> 02:26.734
FROM THE BACK.

02:26.734 --> 02:28.667
OKAY, THERE'S ONE THING
I DON'T GET HERE.

02:28.667 --> 02:29.934
WHAT?

02:29.934 --> 02:31.801
YOU'VE SEEN THIS WOMAN
ON THE TRAIN,

02:31.801 --> 02:33.334
AND YOU FIND HER ATTRACTIVE,
RIGHT?

02:33.334 --> 02:34.601
YEAH.

02:34.601 --> 02:37.067
AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD SEX
WITH HER?
NO.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.367
YOU SEE MY PROBLEM?

02:39.367 --> 02:41.934
LET ME EXPLAIN, PATRICK.

02:41.934 --> 02:44.734
HERE, ON EARTH,
THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN

02:44.734 --> 02:47.000
SEEING SOMEONE YOU LIKE
AND HAVING SEX WITH THEM

02:47.000 --> 02:50.100
THAT WE LIKE TO CALL
"CONVERSATION."

02:50.100 --> 02:53.601
IN JEFF'S CASE, IT CAN LAST
FOR UP TO TEN YEARS.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.634
ARE YOU SAYING
I DON'T CONVERSE?

02:56.634 --> 02:58.234
I CONVERSE.
I TALK TO WOMEN.

02:58.234 --> 02:59.801
WELL, DO THE WOMEN TALK, TOO?

02:59.801 --> 03:01.934
WELL, THEY MUST DO.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.834
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE'S LIKE?

03:05.834 --> 03:10.300
IT'S AS IF YOU TOOK
NAOMI CAMPBELL
AND JENNY AGUTTER,

03:10.300 --> 03:14.434
AND MIXED THEM UP IN A BIG BOWL
WITH DAVINA McCALL'S BOTTOM.

03:16.434 --> 03:18.200
IS IT ANY WONDER
I LOVE HER?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.801
YOU DON'T LOVE HER.

03:19.801 --> 03:21.067
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
HER BOTTOM.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.100
YEAH, YOU HAVEN'T--

03:23.100 --> 03:24.567
WHAT?

03:24.567 --> 03:26.834
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE WOMAN
ON THE TRAIN'S BOTTOM,

03:26.834 --> 03:29.934
SO HOW DO YOU <i>KNOW</i>
IT'S LIKE DAVINA McCALL'S?

03:29.934 --> 03:34.734
AH, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN
DAVINA McCALL'S BOTTOM EITHER.

03:34.734 --> 03:39.067
I ADDED DAVINA'S BOTTOM
TO THE CAMPBELL-AGUTTER MIX

03:39.067 --> 03:41.367
TO LEND AN AIR OF ENIGMA.

03:41.367 --> 03:43.834
DAVINA DOES HAVE
AN ENIGMATIC BOTTOM.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.767
IS IT LUSH, IS IT PERT?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.868
UNH! THE MYSTERY CONTINUES.

03:49.501 --> 03:52.534
BUT YOU'VE ONLY SEEN HER LEG
AND THE BACK OF HER HEAD.

03:52.534 --> 03:54.300
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN HER FACE.

03:54.300 --> 03:58.968
WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE, YOU CAN
SEE PAST NOT SEEING STUFF.

03:58.968 --> 04:01.000
YOU CAN'T CALL IT "LOVE" YET.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.801
OTHERWISE, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW

04:03.801 --> 04:06.868
THE FRONT OF HER HEAD
AS WELL AS YOU KNOW THE BACK?

04:06.868 --> 04:08.834
"BREAKFAST"?

04:10.501 --> 04:14.067
YOU'VE BEEN SEEING HIM
TWO WHOLE WEEKS?

04:14.067 --> 04:16.033
THAT'S BROKEN
YOUR PREVIOUS COMMITMENT RECORD.

04:16.033 --> 04:17.868
WHICH WAS?

04:17.868 --> 04:19.399
BREAKFAST?

04:21.033 --> 04:23.868
LIAM BRYSON.
IT'S A GOOD NAME, I LIKE IT.

04:23.868 --> 04:26.400
AND HE'S A DOCTOR.
YOU GET EXTRA POINTS FOR THAT.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.434
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.000
A SURGEON.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.634
NOT A GYNECOLOGIST?
NO.

04:31.634 --> 04:33.534
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DATE A GYNECOLOGIST.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.734
I WANT TO <i>KNOW</i> I'M SPECIAL.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.734
BUT IS IT LOVE,
OR JUST THE OTHER THING?

04:40.734 --> 04:42.000
DEFINITELY LOVE.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.968
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT JUST GREAT SEX?

04:43.968 --> 04:45.501
YOU'RE HERE.

04:46.934 --> 04:50.100
MAYBE IT'S BOTH.
TELL US MORE.

04:50.100 --> 04:54.734
WELL, HE'S SIGNIFICANTLY TALLER
THAN MY LAST TWO BOYFRIENDS,

04:54.734 --> 04:57.667
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A WIFE
OR A PRISON RECORD.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.868
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

04:59.868 --> 05:02.133
HE'S KIND AND CONSIDERATE,

05:02.133 --> 05:04.767
BUT I STILL WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM!

05:04.767 --> 05:06.634
WHAT'S HE LOOK LIKE?

05:07.667 --> 05:09.501
OH, IS THAT WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HIM?

05:09.501 --> 05:11.100
OH.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.000
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HE'S GORGEOUS.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.601
HOW GORGEOUS?

05:16.601 --> 05:18.934
OKAY, I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO SAY THIS,

05:18.934 --> 05:22.033
I DIDN'T WANT TO BOAST BUT...
KNITTING PATTERN.

05:22.033 --> 05:23.801
( both gasp )

05:23.801 --> 05:27.334
KNITTING PATTERN GUY HAS COME
TO LIFE, QUALIFIED AS A DOCTOR,

05:27.334 --> 05:28.901
AND ASKED <i>YOU</i> OUT?

05:28.901 --> 05:32.267
MY PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED,
AND HE MISSED ME BY ONE WOMAN.

05:32.267 --> 05:34.701
YOU CAN PUT AWAY
YOUR KNITTING NEEDLES--

05:34.701 --> 05:36.934
HE'S OUT, AND HE'S MINE.

05:36.934 --> 05:38.467
RIGHT.

05:38.467 --> 05:40.100
SO, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HIM?

05:40.100 --> 05:41.834
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH HIM.

05:43.067 --> 05:45.701
NOTHING AT ALL.
HE'S WONDERFUL.

05:49.601 --> 05:51.801
NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING!
GOOD.
GREAT.

05:51.801 --> 05:54.033
MUCH.
AH.
AH.

05:54.033 --> 05:55.567
IT'S NOT WORTH
BOTHERING YOU WITH.

05:55.567 --> 05:56.567
IT'S NOT A BOTHER.

05:56.567 --> 05:57.968
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.

05:57.968 --> 06:01.300
WE <i>WANT</i> TO KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR HANDSOME BOYFRIEND.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.701
IT'S JUST--IT'S...

06:03.701 --> 06:07.400
IT'S JUST A STUPID, TINY,
INSIGNIFICANT, LITTLE THING.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.434
OH, THAT'S THE WORST!

06:11.634 --> 06:14.501
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE PROBLEM, JANE.

06:14.501 --> 06:17.734
DOES HE PICK HIS TEETH?
DOES HE DRINK TOO MUCH?

06:17.734 --> 06:19.501
DOES HE MOVE HOUSE
WITHOUT TELLING YOU?

06:19.501 --> 06:21.133
THAT'S THE ONE <i>I</i> HATE.

06:21.133 --> 06:23.367
WHY ARE YOU TWO
SO INTERESTED?

06:23.367 --> 06:25.667
YOU GUYS ARE JUST JEALOUS
'CAUSE I'VE GOT SOMEONE.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.567
EHH EHH EHH--
I'VE GOT SOMEONE, TOO.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.367
WHY WOULD I BE JEALOUS?
YEAH.

06:29.367 --> 06:31.334
AND I'M BEING STALKED, ACTUALLY,

06:31.334 --> 06:33.868
SO I'M PRETTY SECURE
IN MY ATTRACTIVENESS.

06:34.901 --> 06:36.300
YOU'RE BEING STALKED?

06:36.300 --> 06:39.033
IS THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?
MY GOD!

06:39.033 --> 06:41.801
EVERY DAY ON MY WAY HOME
FROM WORK, A MAN FOLLOWS ME.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.901
IT'S TRUE.
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE POLICE?

06:43.901 --> 06:46.067
THEY SAID I WAS JUST BEING
SILLY AND PARANOID.

06:46.067 --> 06:48.400
I HEARD THEM LAUGHING
AFTER I LEFT.
HOW TERRIBLE.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.667
WELL, HAVE YOU CONFRONTED
THE MAN WHO FOLLOWS YOU?

06:50.667 --> 06:52.300
WELL, THERE'S NO POINT,
IS THERE?

06:52.300 --> 06:54.434
I MEAN, IT'S NEVER
THE SAME MAN TWICE.

06:56.501 --> 06:59.934
SOMETIMES THEY SWITCH OVER
WHEN I'M HALFWAY HOME.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.601
IT'S SO WELL-ORGANIZED.

07:03.234 --> 07:05.000
OKAY, RETURNING
FROM PLANET JANE,

07:05.000 --> 07:06.767
LARGELY BECAUSE I'M SCARED,

07:06.767 --> 07:09.100
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND?

07:09.100 --> 07:10.868
IT'S NOT A BIG PROBLEM.

07:10.868 --> 07:12.267
TINY, LITTLE CHARACTER FLAW.

07:12.267 --> 07:14.300
I CAN KIND OF FORGIVE
HIM FOR IT,

07:14.300 --> 07:16.734
BUT SOMETIMES
I KIND OF CAN'T, YOU KNOW?

07:16.734 --> 07:18.367
ABSOLUTELY.
BEEN THERE.

07:18.367 --> 07:19.701
WHAT DOES HE DO?

07:19.701 --> 07:21.567
OKAY, SOMETIMES--

07:21.567 --> 07:24.868
ACTUALLY, ALL OF THE TIME,
AND IT'S SO IRRITATING--

07:24.868 --> 07:28.167
WHAT?
I CAN'T STOP CRITICIZING HIM!

07:28.167 --> 07:30.601
HONESTLY, IT'S DRIVING ME
UP THE WALL!

07:30.601 --> 07:34.133
UH, IF YOU'RE CRITICIZING HIM,
ISN'T THAT YOUR FAULT?

07:34.133 --> 07:36.634
OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
TAKE HIS SIDE.

07:37.634 --> 07:39.567
WHY DO YOU
CRITICIZE HIM?

07:39.567 --> 07:41.167
HE'S A MAN. 

07:41.167 --> 07:45.767
HE'S A WHOLE, EXCITING BUFFET
OF IMPROVABILITY.

07:45.767 --> 07:49.400
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE TO START--
HAIR, CLOTHES, HIS MOTHER.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.968
YOU SHOULDN'T TRY TO CHANGE MEN,
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

07:51.968 --> 07:54.434
THEN WHAT'S THE POINT
IN HAVING ONE?

07:55.868 --> 07:57.400
SALLY, FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,

07:57.400 --> 07:59.634
WHY NOT APPRECIATE A MAN
FOR WHAT HE IS,

07:59.634 --> 08:01.501
NOT WHAT YOU CAN MAKE HIM INTO?

08:01.501 --> 08:04.367
I'M GOING TO DO THAT.
OF COURSE I'M GOING TO DO THAT.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.567
GOOD.
SO, WHEN CAN WE MEET HIM?

08:06.567 --> 08:08.534
WHEN HE'S FINISHED.

08:10.367 --> 08:15.467
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT NEXT TUESDAY
AFTER WORK?

08:15.467 --> 08:17.234
MM-HMM.
THAT'S FINE BY ME.

08:17.234 --> 08:19.767
STEVE'S FREE, I'M SURE
WE CAN GET A HOLD OF PATRICK--

08:19.767 --> 08:20.901
THE BOYS WILL BE THERE?

08:20.901 --> 08:22.767
LIAM CAN'T MEET THAT LOT.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.267
WHAT IF THEY TALK ABOUT SEX?
WHAT IF?

08:25.267 --> 08:27.234
WHAT IF LIAM
TELLS THEM ABOUT ME?

08:27.234 --> 08:30.667
I CAN'T STAY FRIENDS WITH MEN
WHO KNOW WHAT I'M LIKE IN BED.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.333
I'D HAVE TO KILL THEM.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.501
RIGHT, SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU'VE KILLED EVERY MAN

08:34.501 --> 08:36.100
YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO BED WITH?

08:36.100 --> 08:40.299
OH, I THOUGHT
THEY JUST STOPPED PHONING.

09:07.801 --> 09:10.868
SORRY, EXCUSE ME.

09:10.868 --> 09:13.467
OH, EXCUSE ME,
IS THERE ROOM FOR ME THERE?

09:13.467 --> 09:14.968
UM, YEAH.

09:18.334 --> 09:21.200
LOOK, THERE'S A SEAT
BACK THERE, I'LL MOVE.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.234
OH. OH, NO, ARE YOU SURE?

09:23.234 --> 09:24.734
YEAH, THERE'S MORE ROOM.

09:24.734 --> 09:26.400
OH, THANKS.

09:35.868 --> 09:38.133
OH, SORRY.

09:38.133 --> 09:42.100
 ( thinking )
 <i>OKAY, THIS IS IT JEFF,</i>
 <i>LOOK AT HER.</i>

09:42.100 --> 09:44.767
 <i>JUST LOOK AT HER,</i>
 <i>YOU CAN DO IT.</i>

09:47.667 --> 09:51.801
 <i>OH, I WAS RIGHT,</i>
 <i>SHE'S GORGEOUS!</i>

09:59.601 --> 10:01.467
SORRY.

10:01.467 --> 10:03.100
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

10:03.100 --> 10:05.200
NO, NO, NOTHING.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.701
UM--

10:06.701 --> 10:10.801
 <i>SAY SOMETHING SENSIBLE,</i>
 <i>SAY SOMETHING SENSIBLE.</i>

10:10.801 --> 10:14.234
YOU--YOU LOOK JUST LIKE
THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

10:15.501 --> 10:22.334
NO! I-I'M SORRY.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST, WHAT I--

10:22.334 --> 10:24.200
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:24.200 --> 10:26.767
I'M FINE, YEAH,
I'M GREAT, THANKS.

10:26.767 --> 10:29.334
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE ALWAYS
SEEN YOU SITTING OVER THERE,

10:29.334 --> 10:31.868
AND I COULD ONLY SEE
THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD.

10:31.868 --> 10:34.934
OH, OKAY.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.834
BUT THE FRONT'S JUST AS GOOD.

10:37.834 --> 10:41.334
BETTER, IN FACT,
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A FACE.

10:42.868 --> 10:45.100
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.067
WELL, THANKS.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.534
AND--AND YOU'VE GOT A LEG.

10:52.968 --> 10:56.033
UH, I MEAN...ANOTHER LEG.

10:56.033 --> 10:57.534
WHAT?

10:57.534 --> 10:58.868
 <i>DON'T PANIC.</i>

10:58.868 --> 11:00.267
 <i>KEEP IT SENSIBLE.</i>

11:00.267 --> 11:01.868
 <i>CONCENTRATE.</i>

11:01.868 --> 11:03.767
I'M JUST SAYING IT--IT'S GREAT

11:03.767 --> 11:06.367
TO SEE YOUR LEGS TOGETHER
FOR ONCE.

11:06.367 --> 11:08.968
UH, NO, NO!

11:08.968 --> 11:14.234
WHAT I MEANT WAS, NORMALLY,
I ENJOY YOUR LEGS SEPARATELY.

11:15.534 --> 11:17.934
WELL, ONE OF YOUR LEGS ANYWAY.

11:17.934 --> 11:20.434
IT WAS SITTING OVER THERE

11:20.434 --> 11:21.968
WITH THE REST OF YOU, SO, 

11:21.968 --> 11:25.667
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'D KNOW THAT.

11:25.667 --> 11:28.133
BUT--BUT I COULD ONLY
SEE THE LEFT ONE.

11:28.133 --> 11:30.801
OKAY.

11:30.801 --> 11:33.367
( exhales loudly )

11:33.367 --> 11:36.367
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT
TO SEE THEM BOTH HERE.

11:36.367 --> 11:39.801
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, HUH?

11:39.801 --> 11:42.601
I'M NOT SAYING
I PREFERRED THEM SEPARATELY.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.868
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE BETTER
TOGETHER. I CAN SEE THAT.

11:44.868 --> 11:47.767
THEY'RE, WELL,
THEY'RE LIKE A LEG TEAM.

11:47.767 --> 11:50.467
GOOD.

11:50.467 --> 11:53.067
BELIEVE ME, I'M  NOT TRYING
TO PART YOUR LEGS.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.367
NO, NO, UH...

11:56.367 --> 11:59.634
NOT "PART" IN THE SENSE OF,
YOU KNOW, UM--

11:59.634 --> 12:01.501
I MEAN, I DON' WANT TO--

12:01.501 --> 12:02.868
WHAT?

12:02.868 --> 12:05.567
AMPUTATE ONE.

12:07.701 --> 12:08.834
I'M SORRY?

12:08.834 --> 12:12.667
I'M NOT ONE OF THESE AMPUTATORS.

12:12.667 --> 12:15.300
 <i>AMPUTATORS?!</i>

12:15.300 --> 12:17.133
AMPUTATORS?

12:17.133 --> 12:19.734
YEAH, IN CASE YOU WERE WORRYING.

12:19.734 --> 12:22.734
I'M NOT ONE.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.601
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "AMPUTATORS"?

12:24.601 --> 12:26.267
WELL...

12:26.267 --> 12:28.567
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT AMPUTATING FOR?

12:28.567 --> 12:32.400
I'M SORRY. IT'S ON MY MIND.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.434
WHY?

12:33.434 --> 12:34.734
WELL...

12:34.734 --> 12:37.100
 <i>EXPLAIN--TELL HER</i>
 <i>YOU JUST GOT LOST,</i>

12:37.100 --> 12:39.434
 <i>TELL HER THE TRUTH.</i>

12:39.434 --> 12:42.067
BECAUSE...
 <i>THE TRUTH, FOR ONCE!</i>

12:42.067 --> 12:44.000
 <i>DON'T TELL A STUPID LIE!</i>

12:46.734 --> 12:48.300
I GOT A WOODEN LEG.

12:51.300 --> 12:54.501
OH. OH, NO. REALLY?

12:54.501 --> 12:57.667
YES, I HAD
ONE OF MY LEGS AMPUTATED.

12:57.667 --> 13:00.100
BUT NEVER MIND, EH?

13:00.100 --> 13:03.234
I'M SO SORRY.

13:03.234 --> 13:05.400
WELL, NO WONDER
IT'S ON YOUR MIND.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.601
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

13:06.601 --> 13:11.100
REALLY. EASY COME, EASY GO.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.300
WHICH ONE?

13:13.300 --> 13:14.601
I'M SORRY?

13:14.601 --> 13:17.000
WHICH LEG DID YOU
HAVE AMPUTATED?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
UM--

13:18.000 --> 13:19.734
 <i>THINK, THINK!</i>

13:19.734 --> 13:21.667
 <i>WHY CAN'T I THINK?</i>

13:21.667 --> 13:25.234
SORRY, IT WAS
SUCH A LONG TIME AGO.

13:25.234 --> 13:27.100
WHAT?

13:27.100 --> 13:29.934
THE LEFT ONE.
IT WAS THE LEFT.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.734
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT?

13:31.734 --> 13:34.634
UM...

13:36.601 --> 13:40.434
WELL, IT--IT WAS RUBBISH.

13:40.434 --> 13:42.367
RUBBISH?

13:42.367 --> 13:47.767
I HAD A--A LEG...ILLNESS.

13:52.634 --> 13:55.300
WHY DO YOU GET SO NERVOUS?

13:55.300 --> 13:57.234
IS IT BECAUSE OF YOUR LEG?

13:57.234 --> 14:00.467
YEAH, IT--IT'S MY LEG'S FAULT.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.667
ARE YOU SCARED
OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK?

14:02.667 --> 14:06.167
I--I'M ALWAYS SCARED
OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL THINK.

14:06.167 --> 14:09.367
WELL, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK?
WHAT?

14:09.367 --> 14:14.400
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF EXPERIENCE WITH DISABILITY,

14:14.400 --> 14:15.834
AND I THINK...

14:15.834 --> 14:18.934
YOU'RE VERY, VERY BRAVE.

14:20.367 --> 14:21.767
OH, GOOD.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.534
HI, DARLING.

14:30.534 --> 14:32.067
SORRY I'M LATE.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.634
DAVINA McCALL'S ASS--
PERT OR LUSH?

14:34.634 --> 14:39.100
OR, TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY,
"HELLO."

14:39.100 --> 14:40.734
SO, IS SALLY HERE YET?

14:40.734 --> 14:43.000
'CAUSE SHE'S GONNA DROP BY
WITH HER NEW BLOKE.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.534
WHAT, THE SURGEON GUY?
YEAH.

14:44.534 --> 14:46.033
SALLY'S GOING OUT
WITH A SURGEON?

14:46.033 --> 14:47.200
IS THAT JEFF?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.601
Steve: OF COURSE IT'S JEFF.

14:48.601 --> 14:50.367
Susan:
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "OF COURSE"?

14:50.367 --> 14:51.534
HE'S WITH A WOMAN.

14:51.534 --> 14:52.801
THAT'S PRACTICALLY
A DISGUISE!

14:52.801 --> 14:53.834
SHH!

14:53.834 --> 14:57.801
WELL, THIS IS NICE.

14:57.801 --> 15:00.100
IT'S BRILLIANT!

15:00.100 --> 15:03.767
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE
EVEN NICER?

15:05.767 --> 15:07.367
WELL, UM--

15:07.367 --> 15:09.367
IN CASE YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN COUNTING, 

15:09.367 --> 15:12.067
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME
WE'VE BEEN OUT.

15:12.067 --> 15:15.267
OH, RIGHT. THIRD TIME, EH?

15:15.267 --> 15:16.334
DEFINITELY.

15:16.334 --> 15:18.033
I'VE BEEN ENJOYING MYSELF
SO MUCH

15:18.033 --> 15:20.200
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
THREE TIMES ALREADY.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.400
FEELS MORE LIKE...

15:22.400 --> 15:24.667
TWICE.

15:24.667 --> 15:27.934
WELL, DOESN'T TIME FLY?

15:27.934 --> 15:31.968
AND WE'RE NOT EVEN <i>REALLY</i>
ENJOYING OURSELVES YET.

15:32.968 --> 15:35.033
UM...YEAH.

15:35.033 --> 15:40.434
BEFORE WE DO
ANY MORE <i>ENJOYING,</i>

15:40.434 --> 15:43.434
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'D PROBABLY BETTER MENTION.

15:43.434 --> 15:45.701
IS THIS ABOUT YOUR LEG?

15:45.701 --> 15:48.234
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY MUCH
ABOUT MY LEG.

15:49.767 --> 15:51.467
LISTEN, I'VE TOLD YOU,

15:51.467 --> 15:54.801
I <i>KEEP ON</i> TELLING YOU,
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

15:54.801 --> 15:59.767
IN FACT, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
THAT DREW ME TO YOU WAS-- 

15:59.767 --> 16:01.767
YOU'RE SOMEONE
WHO'S HAD TO BE BRAVE.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.767
OH, UH, IT WAS--IT WAS NOTHING.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.000
LOSING YOUR LEG WAS NOTHING?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.667
WELL, WHAT'S A LEG?

16:12.667 --> 16:16.434
THERE'S
PLENTY MORE LEGS IN...

16:16.434 --> 16:19.334
THE SEA...

16:19.334 --> 16:20.934
OF LEGS.

16:20.934 --> 16:23.200
THE LEG SEA.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.334
THAT'S NOT AN ACTUAL PLACE.

16:25.334 --> 16:26.834
NO.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.868
YOU KNOW WHAT'S SWEET?

16:28.868 --> 16:31.000
YOU NEVER TRIED TO IMPRESS ME.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.534
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
THE KIND OF RUBBISH MEN SAY

16:33.534 --> 16:35.067
JUST TO GET ME INTO BED.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.767
PROBABLY GOT
A BIT OF AN IDEA.

16:37.901 --> 16:39.968
THE LIES I'VE BEEN TOLD.

16:39.968 --> 16:41.701
LIES. THOSE ARE BAD.

16:43.200 --> 16:47.934
OH, LISTEN, I HAVE TO GO
AND TALK TO SOMEONE, OKAY?

16:52.601 --> 16:54.367
MMM. STAY HOT.

17:04.032 --> 17:08.032
SO? SHE'S GORGEOUS
AND YOU'RE DEFINITELY IN.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.367
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
THIS TIME?

17:12.901 --> 17:15.000
THIS IS THE WORST ONE EVER!

17:17.133 --> 17:21.834
I--I--I CAN'T EVEN
TALK ABOUT IT!

17:21.834 --> 17:24.099
JEFF, JEFF.

17:24.099 --> 17:31.133
I KNOW ABOUT THE GIGGLE LOOP,
THE SOCK GAP, THE NUDITY BUFFER,

17:31.133 --> 17:34.167
AND WHAT YOU SAID
TO AUDREY WATKINS.

17:34.167 --> 17:37.234
BELIEVE ME, THERE IS <i>NOTHING</i>
YOU CAN POSSIBLY SAY

17:37.234 --> 17:38.801
THAT WILL SURPRISE ME.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.968
WHAT'S GONE WRONG THIS TIME?

17:41.968 --> 17:44.601
I'VE GOT TOO MANY LEGS.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.467
I'M GLAD WE CHOSE
THAT JACKET.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.968
IT REALLY SORTS OUT
YOUR SHOULDERS.

17:52.968 --> 17:55.200
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY SHOULDERS?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.534
YOU'VE GOT LOPPY SHOULDERS.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.200
AND NOW THEY'RE SYMMETRICAL.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.501
WHAT?

17:59.501 --> 18:01.334
OF COURSE,
NOW YOUR HEAD'S A BIT SMALL.

18:01.334 --> 18:02.567
TRY TO EMPHASIZE YOUR HEAD.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.868
OH, I'VE GOT A SMALL HEAD NOW.

18:04.868 --> 18:08.000
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S SMALL, LIAM.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.701
I'M JUST SAYING TRY
TO REMIND PEOPLE IT'S THERE.

18:10.701 --> 18:13.167
IT'S NOT SMALL.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.167
OF COURSE IT ISN'T.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.634
IT'S DISCREET.

18:15.634 --> 18:19.234
WHICH IS LUCKY, BECAUSE IT'S
THE TINIEST BIT OFF-CENTER.

18:20.701 --> 18:22.634
NOW, REMEMBER,
DON'T KEEP ON ABOUT YOUR WORK.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.534
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ALL THE GORY DETAILS--

18:24.534 --> 18:25.534
I KNOW, I KNOW.

18:25.534 --> 18:27.467
AND NO SEX TALK WITH THE BOYS.

18:27.467 --> 18:29.100
YOU SAID--FOUR TIMES.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.100
ONCE WITH YOUR FOOT
ON MY NECK.

18:36.267 --> 18:40.234
SO, ON YOUR FIRST MEETING
WITH THIS WOMAN,

18:40.234 --> 18:43.767
YOU ACCIDENTALLY TOLD HER
YOU HAVE...

18:43.767 --> 18:45.467
ONE LEG.

18:47.434 --> 18:49.400
IT'S PERFECT, ISN'T IT?

18:49.400 --> 18:52.400
THIS IS THE CURSE
OF JEFF MURDOCH.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.601
I MEET THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS,

18:54.601 --> 18:57.300
AND I CAN'T TAKE
MY TROUSERS OFF.

19:02.701 --> 19:04.601
THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.234
BUT WHAT ABOUT MY LEGS?

19:08.234 --> 19:10.934
WELL, SHE'S BOUND
TO COUNT THEM EVENTUALLY.

19:10.934 --> 19:12.534
STEVE.

19:12.534 --> 19:13.934
WELL, IF IT'S ANY HELP,

19:13.934 --> 19:17.067
SALLY'S NEW BOYFRIEND
IS A SURGEON.

19:20.267 --> 19:23.067
ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU COULD JUST TELL HER.

19:23.067 --> 19:25.901
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE BETTER.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.100
AND THIS IS STEVE.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.167
STEVE, THIS IS LIAM.

19:30.167 --> 19:31.701
HI. HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.

19:31.701 --> 19:33.334
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

19:33.334 --> 19:36.167
RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
I'M GETTING SO TIRED OF THIS.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.300
I'M BEING STALKED AGAIN.

19:38.300 --> 19:39.968
AND THIS IS JANE.

19:39.968 --> 19:41.667
TRY TO REMAIN CALM.

19:41.667 --> 19:44.968
THERE WAS A GUY SITTING
ON A BENCH, READING A NEWSPAPER,
AND STALKING ME.

19:44.968 --> 19:49.801
JANE, HOW CAN YOU BE STALKED
BY SOMEONE WHO ISN'T MOVING,

19:49.801 --> 19:51.400
OR, IN FACT, <i>LOOKING</i> AT YOU?

19:51.400 --> 19:54.968
OKAY, MAYBE HE WAS JUST UGLY.

19:54.968 --> 19:57.067
BUT THAT'S BAD, TOO.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.601
OH, HELLO.
HI.

19:59.601 --> 20:01.901
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.968
OF COURSE.

20:03.968 --> 20:05.834
UH, IS THIS YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND?

20:05.834 --> 20:07.868
CAN I HAVE A QUICK WORD
WITH YOU, PLEASE?

20:07.868 --> 20:09.133
BUT--
OVER HERE, PLEASE.

20:09.133 --> 20:10.167
BUT YOU SAID--

20:12.567 --> 20:15.133
BUY YOU SAID YOUR BOYFRIEND
WAS A SURGEON.

20:15.133 --> 20:16.934
HE WORKS
IN THAT GENERAL AREA, YES.

20:16.934 --> 20:20.133
HE WORKS IN MY STREET.
HE'S A BUTCHER!

20:23.534 --> 20:25.200
HE WAS DEMOTED.

20:26.634 --> 20:29.167
JEFF, I'VE GOT SOME PEOPLE
I WANT YOU TO MEET.

20:29.167 --> 20:30.167
NO. CHRISSIE, LISTEN.

20:30.167 --> 20:31.434
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

20:31.434 --> 20:33.000
CHRISSIE, PLEASE.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.734
IT'S ABOUT MY LEG.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.467
WHAT ABOUT IT?

20:37.467 --> 20:41.133
I THINK IT'S...

20:41.133 --> 20:42.834
IMPROVING.

20:46.968 --> 20:49.767
WHAT <i>ARE</i> YOU ON ABOUT?

20:49.767 --> 20:52.334
COME ON, I REALLY WANT YOU
TO MEET THESE PEOPLE.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.534
IT'S A SURPRISE.

20:53.534 --> 20:56.200
CHRISSIE, I NEED
TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.234
EXPLAIN IN A MINUTE.
DAVID--

20:58.234 --> 21:02.467
HI, YOU MUST BE JEFF.

21:02.467 --> 21:05.801
THIS IS DAVID. 
HE'S MY BROTHER.

21:05.801 --> 21:08.934
HE'S THE BEST GUY
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD,

21:08.934 --> 21:10.801
AND HE'S MY ABSOLUTE HERO.

21:10.801 --> 21:13.067
AND HE'S COME HERE TONIGHT
JUST TO MEET YOU.

21:13.067 --> 21:16.167
GREAT, FANTASTIC. HI.

21:16.167 --> 21:19.100
LISTEN, I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

21:19.100 --> 21:22.501
YEAH, WELL I ESPECIALLY WANTED
YOU TO TALK TO HIM.

21:22.501 --> 21:24.267
TELL HIM WHY, DAVID.
CHRISSIE--

21:24.267 --> 21:25.434
I LOST A LEG, TOO.

21:29.634 --> 21:32.701
I LOST MY RIGHT LEG
IN A CAR CRASH FIVE YEARS AGO.

21:33.934 --> 21:35.901
SEE, YOU REMEMBER WHEN
I TOLD YOU

21:35.901 --> 21:37.701
I HAD EXPERIENCE
WITH DISABILITY?

21:37.701 --> 21:39.734
WELL, THIS IS HIM.

21:39.734 --> 21:42.334
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
DAVID'S BEEN THROUGH.

21:43.634 --> 21:46.133
SO, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, TOO, JEFF.

21:47.467 --> 21:48.467
OH...

21:49.701 --> 21:53.200
YOU'RE MY TWO BRAVE BOYS.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.367
OH, I'M NOT <i>REALLY</i> THAT BRAVE.

21:56.367 --> 21:59.234
I'M SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU ABOUT DAVID BEFORE.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.434
I KNOW.

22:00.434 --> 22:02.467
UM--
I JUST DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FEEL,

22:02.467 --> 22:03.467
WELL, PRESSURED.

22:03.467 --> 22:05.801
LISTEN, BEFORE THIS GOES
ANY FURTHER.

22:05.801 --> 22:08.334
HANG ON A MOMENT, JEFF,
ONE MORE THING.

22:09.434 --> 22:10.868
MEET THE GUYS.

22:10.868 --> 22:12.100
All: HI, JEFF.

22:13.968 --> 22:17.868
THIS IS OUR LITTLE DISABILITY
SUPPORT GROUP.

22:17.868 --> 22:23.467
WE'VE GOT AMPUTEES,
WE'VE GOT THE LOT.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.267
NORMALLY WE MEET
ALONG THE ROAD,

22:25.267 --> 22:29.701
BUT, TONIGHT, WE WANTED
TO COME HERE AND MEET YOU.

22:29.701 --> 22:33.367
CHRISSIE TOLD ME YOU
WERE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS.

22:33.367 --> 22:35.334
GREAT.

22:35.334 --> 22:37.868
EVERYBODY,
GIVE A BIG WELCOME TO JEFF--

22:37.868 --> 22:40.567
A BRAVE, BRAVE MAN.

22:43.234 --> 22:45.801
SO, NOT A SURGEON, THEN?

22:45.801 --> 22:47.634
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY
HE WAS A BUTCHER.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.067
PEOPLE WOULD MAKE BUTCHER JOKES.

22:49.067 --> 22:52.167
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE BUTT
OF A LOT OF BUTCHER JOKES.

22:52.167 --> 22:54.334
WHAT ARE BUTCHER JOKES?

22:54.334 --> 22:57.667
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M SURE
THEY'RE OUT THERE.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.601
THEY BETTER NOT BE TALKING
ABOUT SEX.

23:01.601 --> 23:03.701
SO, HOW DID YOU MEET SALLY?

23:03.701 --> 23:04.767
UH, JUST AT WORK.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.267
AT WORK?

23:07.267 --> 23:08.968
SHE'S ONE OF MY REGULARS.

23:12.167 --> 23:13.734
YOUR REGULARS?

23:13.734 --> 23:15.033
IT'S NOT SERIOUS,
IS IT?

23:15.033 --> 23:17.300
WELL, WE'RE GETTING ON
PRETTY WELL I THINK.

23:17.300 --> 23:19.400
YEAH, BUT SALLY'S ALL RIGHT?

23:19.400 --> 23:21.000
YEAH, SHE'S GREAT.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.167
FINE.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.434
TERRIFIC.

23:23.434 --> 23:25.467
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"SHE LOOKS NICE,

23:25.467 --> 23:27.868
LET'S PUT HER STRAIGHT
TO THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE."

23:30.033 --> 23:32.934
ARE YOU REALLY
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

23:32.934 --> 23:34.767
WHO CARES?

23:34.767 --> 23:37.300
SO, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, THEN?

23:37.300 --> 23:39.100
WELL, ALMOST FIRST SIGHT.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.400
I HAD TO SORT HER OUT FIRST.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"SORT HER OUT" EXACTLY?

23:44.200 --> 23:47.267
DO YOU MEAN
IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY?

23:47.267 --> 23:49.767
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES--
A FEW CHOICE CUTS,

23:49.767 --> 23:51.667
AND YOU'VE GOT THE WOMAN
OF YOUR DREAMS.

23:56.634 --> 23:57.968
REALLY?

23:57.968 --> 24:00.000
THAT'S HANDY.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.067
IS IT STRICTLY ETHICAL?

24:02.067 --> 24:03.634
YOU'VE GOT TO SORT OUT
YOUR REGULARS.

24:03.634 --> 24:05.367
YOU SHOULD SEND SUSAN
TO ME SOMETIME.

24:09.734 --> 24:11.267
WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?

24:11.267 --> 24:13.334
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT'S YOUR SPECIALITY?

24:13.334 --> 24:16.634
I'VE GOT A NEW SECRETARY,
AND SHE COULD DO WITH SOME HELP.

24:16.634 --> 24:20.367
AH, DEFINITELY RUMP.

24:20.367 --> 24:22.601
NICE.

24:22.601 --> 24:25.033
GOOD ONE.

24:25.033 --> 24:28.267
THEY COULD BE OVER THERE
TALKING ABOUT SEX. ABOUT ME.

24:28.267 --> 24:32.133
SALLY, YOU CAN'T KEEP LYING
ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIENDS.

24:32.133 --> 24:34.467
BUT I CAN'T END UP
WITH A BUTCHER.

24:34.467 --> 24:37.400
HAVE YOU SEEN BUTCHER'S WIVES?
THEY'RE GIGANTIC!

24:37.400 --> 24:39.434
I'LL DEVELOP A DEEP,
BOOMING LAUGH

24:39.434 --> 24:41.267
AND ROWS AND ROWS
OF EXTRA BREASTS.

24:41.267 --> 24:43.167
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO ME!

24:43.167 --> 24:46.467
SO, WHAT KIND OF PROSTHETIC
DO YOU HAVE, JEFF?

24:46.467 --> 24:49.133
UH--

24:49.133 --> 24:50.634
UM--

24:50.634 --> 24:54.033
I THINK IT WAS A...

24:54.033 --> 24:55.767
FOOTMATIC.

24:57.601 --> 25:00.334
CAN I JUST BORROW
MR. SEX HERE FOR A MOMENT?

25:00.334 --> 25:02.501
SURE, YEAH.
A FOOTMATIC?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.200
IT'S VERY NEW.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.067
LISTEN, MY FLAT MATE'S
JUST GOT BACK--JEANIE.

25:09.701 --> 25:12.367
GIVE HER A WAVE.

25:12.367 --> 25:14.067
SHE THINKS YOU'RE CUTE, TOO.

25:14.067 --> 25:16.100
ANYWAY, I'VE GOT
TO GO HOME WITH HER.

25:16.100 --> 25:18.467
SHE NEEDS ME TO HELP HER OUT
WITH SOMETHING.

25:18.467 --> 25:20.033
DO YOU WANT TO COME, TOO,

25:20.033 --> 25:24.067
OR DO YOU WANT TO STAY
AND TALK TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS?

25:24.067 --> 25:27.868
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
TO SWAY YOU,

25:27.868 --> 25:30.200
BUT THIS COULD BE
YOUR LUCKY NIGHT.

25:35.767 --> 25:39.000
UH, WELL MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST TAKE THINGS A BIT--

25:39.000 --> 25:40.534
SLOWER.

25:40.534 --> 25:42.534
RELATIONSHIP-WISE.

25:42.534 --> 25:45.534
OH, RELATIONSHIP-WISE, YEAH,
WE SHOULD TAKE THINGS VERY SLOW.

25:45.534 --> 25:46.901
GOOD, YEAH.

25:46.901 --> 25:50.100
BUT LET'S GET STUCK RIGHT
INTO THE RAMPANT SEX, SHALL WE?

25:50.100 --> 25:51.701
THAT'S MUCH EASIER.

25:51.701 --> 25:56.734
YEAH, YEAH, UH, OBVIOUSLY.

25:56.734 --> 26:01.901
BUT--BUT YOU NEED TO HELP
YOUR FLAT MATE TONIGHT.

26:01.901 --> 26:04.567
OH, NO.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

26:04.567 --> 26:07.033
SHE'S THE MANAGER
OF A LINGERIE FIRM.

26:07.033 --> 26:10.167
SHE JUST LIKES US
TO TRY OUT ALL THE NEW LINES.

26:10.167 --> 26:13.868
YOU KNOW, WE JUST PRANCE
AROUND THE FLAT ALL NIGHT
IN NAUGHTY UNDERWEAR.

26:13.868 --> 26:16.901
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME
TO COME AND WATCH.

26:16.901 --> 26:19.100
WOULD YOU LIKE TO?

26:21.467 --> 26:24.033
UH, WELL,
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW.

26:24.033 --> 26:25.267
UM--

26:25.267 --> 26:27.801
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

26:27.801 --> 26:30.000
HERE'S THE KEY TO MY FLAT.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.334
JEANIE AND I WILL HEAD BACK NOW,
AND IF YOU WANT TO,

26:34.334 --> 26:37.367
YOU CAN JOIN US LATER.

26:37.367 --> 26:39.367
WE'LL TRY NOT TO START
WITHOUT YOU.

26:42.634 --> 26:45.767
JEFF? JEFF, ARE YOU CRYING?

26:45.767 --> 26:46.801
NO.

26:48.767 --> 26:51.267
NO, I'M JUST REALLY EXCITED

26:51.267 --> 26:55.601
ABOUT ALL THE UNDERWEAR
AND RAMPANT SEX.

26:55.601 --> 26:58.367
OH, DARLING.

26:58.367 --> 27:02.767
STARTING TONIGHT, THAT'S
GONNA BE YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

27:20.367 --> 27:23.000
YOU BASTARD!

27:23.000 --> 27:27.601

27:33.267 --> 27:35.834

YES.

27:35.834 --> 27:38.667
DO YOU DO LEGS?
WELL, YEAH.

27:39.834 --> 27:41.634
HOW MUCH FOR JUST THE LEFT ONE?

27:43.801 --> 27:46.734
I'M SERIOUS, YOU'D BE DOING ME
A FAVOR! TAKE MY LEG!

27:46.734 --> 27:47.734
OKAY.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.434
LET'S JUST GO
AND TALK ABOUT THIS.

27:49.434 --> 27:52.067
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, STEVE.

27:52.067 --> 27:57.467
I'VE GOT THE KEY
TO THE GATES OF PARADISE,

27:57.467 --> 27:59.734
BUT I'VE GOT TOO MANY LEGS!

28:02.868 --> 28:06.167
I'M SURE WE'VE ALL FELT
THAT WAY AT SOME TIME OR OTHER.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.834
SO, SALLY, LIAM'S CERTAINLY
BEEN DOING

28:19.834 --> 28:22.000
SOME LOVELY THINGS
TO YOUR BOTTOM.

28:27.868 --> 28:31.767

28:31.767 --> 28:34.100

28:41.234 --> 28:46.968

28:52.100 --> 28:54.734
