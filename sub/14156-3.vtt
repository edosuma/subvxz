WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:07.708
SO HOW DID YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS

00:07.708 --> 00:08.509
MEET?

00:08.509 --> 00:09.510
>> WHO DO I WRITE THE CHECK

00:09.510 --> 00:10.244
OUT TO?

00:10.244 --> 00:10.844
>> YOU'RE WILLING TO RISK ALL

00:10.844 --> 00:11.579
YOUR MONEY?

00:11.579 --> 00:13.247
I KNOW MY MONEY IS SAFE.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.316
CONGRATULATIONS, PARTNER.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.150
[laughs]

00:16.150 --> 00:17.751
>> I KNOW HE DOES NOT HAVE OUR

00:17.751 --> 00:19.287
BABY IN MY OVERNIGHT BAG.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.254
>> YOUR BABY?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.189
>> ADORABLE!

00:21.189 --> 00:22.223
>> OH, LET ME HOLD HER.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.424
>> YOU SHOULD GIVE ME ANOTHER

00:23.424 --> 00:24.292
CHANCE.

00:24.292 --> 00:27.228
>> TO DO WHAT?

00:27.228 --> 00:28.262
>> YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AT

00:28.262 --> 00:29.363
THIS VERY SPOT?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.665
>> HOW COULD I FORGET?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.134
>> YOU THINK YOU BOUGHT ME?

00:33.134 --> 00:34.268
>> AT LEAST A LITTLE PEACE AND

00:34.268 --> 00:34.802
QUIET.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.304
>> YOU GOT THE WRONG GIRL.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.438
>> YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS,

00:37.438 --> 00:38.172
KEISHA.

00:38.172 --> 00:41.475
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.177
>> * SINGLE

00:43.177 --> 00:44.545
>> * YEAH

00:44.545 --> 00:46.180
* AND YOU SAY LOVE CITY

00:46.180 --> 00:48.382
>> * LADIES

00:48.382 --> 00:49.517
>> * CRAZY

00:49.517 --> 00:51.552
>> * WHAT I WANT, UP TO ME

00:51.552 --> 00:54.255
* I CAN FOLLOW, I CAN LEAD

00:54.255 --> 00:59.227
>> * OR LOSE CONTROL

00:59.227 --> 01:01.562
>> * YOU CAN'T GET MY LOVE

01:01.562 --> 01:03.564
* I KNOW YOU WANT IT

01:03.564 --> 01:04.565
>> * OH, YEAH

01:04.565 --> 01:07.235
>> * YOU WANT IT

01:07.235 --> 01:09.703
* SINGLE LADIES

01:09.703 --> 01:10.671
>> WHERE MY SINGLE LADIES AT?

01:16.710 --> 01:18.812
>> LOOK AT HER OVER THERE.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.414
I CAN TELL BY THE WAY SHE'S

01:20.414 --> 01:21.515
SHIFTING IN HER SEAT.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.517
SHE'S SEXTING ANTONIO AGAIN.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.752
>> [giggles]

01:24.752 --> 01:30.258
>> LET'S GO SEE.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.826
>> OOH, RAQUEL, YOU NASTY.

01:32.826 --> 01:33.627
>> WHAT?

01:33.627 --> 01:35.429
I WAS TEXTING MY AUNT.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.497
>> AND YOU WANTED HER TO PUT

01:36.497 --> 01:37.565
WHAT WHERE?

01:37.565 --> 01:38.466
MM-HMM.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.567
BY THE WAY, YOU COULD'VE USED

01:39.567 --> 01:40.301
MORE ADJECTIVES.

01:40.301 --> 01:44.438
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.507
>> GIRL, YOU HAVE A GIFT.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.375
PUSH "SEND."

01:47.375 --> 01:48.342
>> I GUESS THINGS WITH YOU AND

01:48.342 --> 01:49.643
PAPI CHULO ARE GOING WELL.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.579
>> YEAH, BECAUSE THE MOST I EVER

01:51.579 --> 01:53.214
TEXTED WITH VICTOR WAS TO REMIND

01:53.214 --> 01:54.515
HIM HE HAD A DENTAL APPOINTMENT.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.217
>> CLEARLY, ANTONIO HAS AWAKENED

01:56.217 --> 01:56.817
THE DRAGON.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.286
>> BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE SEX.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.288
ANTONIO IS SO ALIVE AND INTENSE.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.489
AND HE DOESN'T HOLD BACK.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.890
HE ENCOURAGES ME TO DO THE SAME,

02:02.890 --> 02:04.692
AND IT'S LIBERATING.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.660
WHEN I'M WITH HIM, I FEEL LIKE

02:06.660 --> 02:07.561
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.696
>> FROM THESE TEXTS, IT

02:08.696 --> 02:10.498
CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.900
>> SERIOUSLY.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.168
I FEEL LIKE I CAN BUILD

02:14.168 --> 02:15.403
SOMETHING REAL WITH HIM.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.371
WHICH JUST REAFFIRMS THE CHOICE

02:17.371 --> 02:18.639
I MADE TO LEAVE VICTOR.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.874
I KNOW IT'S EARLY ON, BUT I AM

02:20.874 --> 02:22.576
SO HAPPY.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.844
>> ISN'T THIS ONE OF THE BEST

02:23.844 --> 02:24.945
PARTS OF A RELATIONSHIP?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.380
WHEN YOU'RE BOTH HIGH OFF EACH

02:26.380 --> 02:27.615
OTHER AND CAN'T STOP THINKING

02:27.615 --> 02:28.582
ABOUT EACH OTHER?

02:28.582 --> 02:29.550
YOU AREN'T EVEN LISTENING TO ME,

02:29.550 --> 02:30.384
ARE YOU?

02:30.384 --> 02:31.485
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HIM.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.321
>> [giggles]

02:33.321 --> 02:35.623
>> GO AHEAD, ENJOY.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.591
>> SO I GOT MY HAIR DONE,

02:37.591 --> 02:39.427
EYEBROWS WAXED, GOT A MANI-PEDI

02:39.427 --> 02:40.861
ALL FOR MY DATE TONIGHT.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.530
BUT GUESS WHAT.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.332
I HAVE NO DATE TONIGHT.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.799
SELFISH JERK DECIDED TO GET BACK

02:45.799 --> 02:46.800
TOGETHER WITH THE LOVE OF HIS

02:46.800 --> 02:47.535
LIFE.

02:47.535 --> 02:48.302
>> HMM.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.637
>> HOW DARE THIS GUY YOU MET

02:49.637 --> 02:50.771
IN LINE AT THE ATM FIND

02:50.771 --> 02:52.506
HAPPINESS WITHOUT YOU?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.307
>> WHATEVER.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.708
IT'S, LIKE, THE THIRD GUY IN TWO

02:54.708 --> 02:56.344
WEEKS TO BREAK PLANS WITH ME.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.312
>> OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.580
I HAVE TO BREAK OUR LUNCH PLANS

02:59.580 --> 03:00.914
FOR TOMORROW BECAUSE A BIG

03:00.914 --> 03:02.316
COMMISSION FELL THROUGH, AND I

03:02.316 --> 03:03.484
REALLY NEED TO HUSTLE UP SOME

03:03.484 --> 03:04.452
NEW LISTINGS.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.919
>> WELL, MAYBE I CAN COME WITH.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.388
ANYONE AT THE OFFICE CUTE?

03:07.388 --> 03:08.256
>> GIRL...

03:08.256 --> 03:09.723
[laughs] RELAX.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.992
IT'S ALL PART OF BEING SINGLE.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.861
SOMETIMES, THERE'S MORE FAMINE

03:13.861 --> 03:14.995
THAN FEAST.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.697
OR SO I'VE HEARD BECAUSE

03:16.697 --> 03:17.831
WHENEVER I DECIDE TO SPRINKLE

03:17.831 --> 03:19.567
OUT MY BAIT, THE FISH ALWAYS

03:19.567 --> 03:20.568
COME A-SWIMMING.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.836
>> MUST BE NICE TO HAVE OPTIONS.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.972
>> SHE DOESN'T NEED OPTIONS.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.374
SHE'S STILL IN LOVE WITH

03:26.374 --> 03:27.275
MALCOLM.

03:27.275 --> 03:28.476
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO FIND

03:28.476 --> 03:30.478
A WAY TO WORK IT OUT EVENTUALLY.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.779
>> STRANGELY, I'M ON TEAM SEAN.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.514
I USED TO HATE HIM, BUT WHEN HE

03:33.514 --> 03:34.548
DID NOT HESITATE TO COME TO

03:34.548 --> 03:35.983
YOUR RESCUE, I GOT A LITTLE SOFT

03:35.983 --> 03:36.750
SPOT FOR HIM.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.519
>> OMAR, DO YOU ALSO HAVE AN

03:38.519 --> 03:39.587
OPINION ABOUT MY LOVE LIFE THAT

03:39.587 --> 03:40.521
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE?

03:40.521 --> 03:41.322
>> OH, NO.

03:41.322 --> 03:45.326
I WAS WRITING THE NEXT TEXT.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.527
>> I WORK WITH SOME REALLY

03:46.527 --> 03:47.861
DIRTY-MINDED PEOPLE.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.464
HIT "SEND," PLEASE.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.400
>> WELL, ANYBODY ON TEAM MALCOLM

03:52.400 --> 03:53.734
JUST LOST BECAUSE AS SOON AS

03:53.734 --> 03:55.836
POSSIBLE, I'M MOVING MY STUFF

03:55.836 --> 03:57.338
OUT OF HIS PLACE.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.440
AND ANYBODY ON TEAM SEAN, KEEP

03:59.440 --> 04:01.442
DREAMING BECAUSE, HONEY, BEEN

04:01.442 --> 04:02.943
THERE, DONE THAT.

04:02.943 --> 04:03.711
>> OKAY.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.413
OFF.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.814
>> NO MORE TEXTING UNTIL I CAN

04:06.814 --> 04:08.716
FINISH FIGURING OUT THESE BOOKS.

04:08.716 --> 04:09.983
>> THINK YOU CAN FIGURE ME IN

04:09.983 --> 04:11.018
A RAISE?

04:11.018 --> 04:12.586
>> I'LL CERTAINLY TRY, BUT

04:12.586 --> 04:13.787
THERE'S A LOT I WANT TO DO

04:13.787 --> 04:14.788
AROUND HERE FIRST.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.290
I HAVE A VISION TO EXPAND THE

04:16.290 --> 04:16.824
STORE.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.758
I'M GOING TO INCREASE OUR ONLINE

04:17.758 --> 04:18.992
PRESENCE, REVAMP OUR PRINT

04:18.992 --> 04:20.561
CAMPAIGN--SO MANY THINGS.

04:20.561 --> 04:21.495
>> JEEZ.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.596
IS SOMEBODY JUST A LITTLE

04:22.596 --> 04:24.398
EXCITED ABOUT THEIR NEW JOB?

04:24.398 --> 04:25.333
TRY NOT TO MAKE THE REST OF US

04:25.333 --> 04:25.866
LOOK BAD.

04:25.866 --> 04:26.834
>> AND I PROMISE TO TRY AND

04:26.834 --> 04:27.935
WORK SOMETHING OUT BECAUSE I DO

04:27.935 --> 04:29.036
APPRECIATE HOW HARD YOU'VE BEEN

04:29.036 --> 04:29.770
WORKING.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.472
>> I'D SAY IT'S MY WORK ETHIC,

04:31.472 --> 04:32.873
BUT REALLY, I'M JUST GLAD TO BE

04:32.873 --> 04:33.607
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.942
DEREK'S PARENTS ARE IN TOWN, AND

04:34.942 --> 04:35.876
THEY'RE GIVING US THE BLUES

04:35.876 --> 04:37.678
ABOUT "LIVING IN SIN."

04:37.678 --> 04:39.480
>> I'M SORRY.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.748
IT MUST BE ROUGH HAVING TO DEAL

04:40.748 --> 04:41.915
WITH THAT KIND OF INTOLERANCE.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.317
>> OH, IF ONLY THEY WERE

04:43.317 --> 04:44.318
HOMOPHOBIC.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.786
THAT I CAN HANDLE.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.321
WHAT I CAN'T DEAL WITH IS

04:47.321 --> 04:48.389
PARENTS WHO INSIST WE GET

04:48.389 --> 04:49.790
MARRIED, PARENTS WHO WANT ME TO

04:49.790 --> 04:51.359
STOP GETTING DEREK'S MILK FOR

04:51.359 --> 04:52.326
FREE.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.594
DON'T EVEN GO THERE, KEISHA.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.329
THEIR WORDS, NOT MINE.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.697
>> I HAD SOME GOOD ONES BEHIND

04:56.697 --> 04:57.465
THAT TOO.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.599
>> SO MARRIAGE IS COMPLETELY OFF

04:58.599 --> 04:59.333
THE TABLE THEN?

04:59.333 --> 05:00.501
>> JUST BECAUSE WE CAN GET

05:00.501 --> 05:01.869
MARRIED NOW DOESN'T MEAN WE

05:01.869 --> 05:02.670
WANT TO.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.738
DEREK AND I ARE WAY TOO YOUNG

05:04.738 --> 05:06.340
AND HAPPY FOR ALL THAT.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.741
BESIDES, MARRIAGE ISN'T EVEN

05:07.741 --> 05:08.976
LEGAL IN GEORGIA.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.444
SO UNTIL WE CAN AFFORD TO BE

05:10.444 --> 05:11.779
BROKE IN NEW YORK, I DON'T SEE

05:11.779 --> 05:12.646
THE POINT.

[sultry music]

05:13.647 --> 05:19.620

05:36.604 --> 05:37.137
TONIGHT.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.572
>> JUST FOR A SEC.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.774
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.876
>> BABE, AS MUCH AS I WANT SEE

05:42.876 --> 05:45.613
THAT SOMETHING AGAIN, GOD, I'VE

05:45.613 --> 05:46.780
GOT TO WAKE UP EARLY.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.649
WE'VE GOT NEW HORSES TO BREAK.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.484

05:50.484 --> 05:52.152
LONG WITH THOSE SEXY TEXTS.

05:52.152 --> 05:52.886
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.721
I'M SORRY.

05:53.721 --> 05:54.488
[chuckles]

05:54.488 --> 05:55.623
BUT HEY, IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE

05:55.623 --> 05:56.657
TO BE ABOUT SEX, RIGHT?

05:56.657 --> 05:58.692
>> OF COURSE NOT.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.893
I GUESS I'M JUST NOT USED TO

05:59.893 --> 06:01.629
BEING SO THRILLED ABOUT SOMEONE.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.063
YOU COULD HAVE TEXTED ME ABOUT

06:03.063 --> 06:04.498
WANTING TO SHOP AT TARGET, AND

06:04.498 --> 06:06.634
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT IT WAS HOT.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.735
BECAUSE I'D BE DOING IT WITH

06:07.735 --> 06:08.836
YOU.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.848
I CAN'T STAY TONIGHT.

06:20.848 --> 06:24.418
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW, MAMI.

06:26.787 --> 06:27.921
>> OH.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.856
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.959
IT FLIPS ME OUT TO THINK I WAS

JUST SHOWING YOU AND MALCOLM

07:10.764 --> 07:11.499
I WAS W--

07:11.499 --> 07:12.933

07:12.933 --> 07:14.802
I HAD A DATE THREE NIGHTS AGO.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.904
SUPER NICE AND A FOX TO BOOT.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.038
BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY AND GET

07:18.038 --> 07:18.972
A GOOD-NIGHT KISS.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.574
>> HAS HE CALLED?

07:20.574 --> 07:21.609
>> NO.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.010
EVEN THOUGH I LEFT TWO MESSAGES

07:23.010 --> 07:24.512
AND A TEXT.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.013
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS?

07:26.013 --> 07:27.881
>> IT'S EITHER, ONE: HE'S A

07:27.881 --> 07:29.082

07:29.082 --> 07:30.651
AND THAT'S DOUBTFUL.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.952
SO MY MONEY'S ON TWO: HE'S NOT

11:36.864 --> 11:38.298
TECHNICALLY, THIS IS YOUR PLACE

11:38.298 --> 11:39.833
NOW SINCE YOU GOT THE TITLE

11:39.833 --> 11:41.401
WHEN YOU BOUGHT V, SO IF YOU

11:41.401 --> 11:43.136
CAN JUST GIVE ME A FEW WEEKS

11:43.136 --> 11:47.407

11:57.818 --> 11:58.886
BECAUSE I JUST LEFT MY MAN AND

11:58.886 --> 11:59.987
HIS MANSION?

11:59.987 --> 12:01.154
DO YOU KNOW HE HAD A DRY

12:01.154 --> 12:02.322
CLEANERS ON THE PREMISES?

12:02.322 --> 12:04.391
IT TAKES A STRONG WOMAN TO LEAVE

12:27.180 --> 12:28.315
WOMAN SITTING IN THIS ROOM

12:28.315 --> 12:29.817
PREDICTED THAT TEAM MALCOLM

12:29.817 --> 12:30.984
WOULD MAKE A COMEBACK.

12:30.984 --> 12:31.785
>> [scoffs]

12:31.785 --> 12:32.820
DON'T CALL IT A COMEBACK.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.454
JUST CALL IT EX SEX.

12:34.454 --> 12:35.488
>> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.523

12:36.523 --> 12:38.558
>> OH, SO GOOD.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.960
WHICH WAS BAD.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.328
BECAUSE THEN MALCOLM GOT ALL

12:41.328 --> 12:43.296
FULL OF HIMSELF, THINKING ALL HE

12:43.296 --> 12:44.531
HAD TO DO TO MAKE UP WITH ME WAS

12:44.531 --> 12:45.833
TO GET ME INTO BED.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.500
SO NOW WE'RE IN AN EVEN WORSE

12:47.500 --> 12:48.568
PLACE THAN WE WERE BEFORE,

12:48.568 --> 12:49.903
IF YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.171
>> I DON'T HAVE TO.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.205
YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM FOR ALL

12:52.205 --> 12:53.006
THE RIGHT REASONS.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.274
I GOTTA SAY, THIS SOUNDS LIKE

12:54.274 --> 12:55.275
A STEP BACKWARDS.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.543
>> BUT LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

12:56.543 --> 12:57.410

12:57.410 --> 12:58.946
THEY BREAK UP TO MAKE UP ALL

12:58.946 --> 13:00.347

13:00.347 --> 13:02.149
>> NO, I'M NOT DOING IT AGAIN.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.583
IT'S LIKE EATING THAT SECOND

13:04.417 --> 13:06.854

13:07.988 --> 13:09.189
ANGRY AT YOURSELF AND READY TO

13:09.189 --> 13:10.057
THROW UP.

13:10.057 --> 13:10.958
>> WELL, IF SOMETHING MAKES YOU

13:10.958 --> 13:12.159
FEEL THAT BAD, IT'S PROBABLY

13:12.159 --> 13:13.160

OH, COME ON!

14:53.660 --> 14:58.365
[moaning continues]

15:19.486 --> 15:21.188
>> POSTMODERN.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.024

15:47.214 --> 15:49.216
I'M JOE MASON.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.317
YOU WITH THE BANK?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.052
>> NO, I'M KEISHA GREENE,

15:52.052 --> 15:53.653
THE REALTOR OF THIS HOUSE.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.123
THIS VACANT HOUSE.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.524
YOU'RE TRESPASSING ON PRIVATE

15:57.524 --> 15:58.391
PROPERTY.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.160
>> I KNOW, BUT IT'S ONLY

16:00.160 --> 16:01.128
TEMPORARY.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.695
>> DOESN'T SEEM TEMPORARY TO ME.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.131
>> I PROMISE IT IS.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.398
I HAD A NASTY BREAKUP WITH MY

16:05.398 --> 16:07.200
GIRLFRIEND, AND I HAD TO MOVE

16:07.200 --> 16:08.001
OUT QUICK.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.202
HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.204
>> WELL, HERE'S A THOUGHT.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.272
HOW ABOUT AN APARTMENT?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.007
>> LOOK, I CAN'T AFFORD ONE,

16:14.007 --> 16:14.641
ALL RIGHT?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.243
I'M A PROFESSIONAL BOXER, AND

16:16.243 --> 16:17.477
I'M TRAINING FOR A REALLY

16:17.477 --> 16:18.411
IMPORTANT BOUT--

16:18.411 --> 16:20.380
A BOUT THAT I DON'T GET PAID FOR

16:20.380 --> 16:21.614
UNTIL AFTER I FIGHT.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.283
>> MY COUSIN WENT PRO YEARS AGO.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.651
HE HAD A MANAGER TAKING CARE OF

16:24.651 --> 16:25.385
HIM.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.119
HOW COME YOU DON'T?

16:26.119 --> 16:29.756
>> WELL, 'CAUSE MY MANAGER IS MY

16:29.756 --> 16:31.191
EX-GIRLFRIEND'S FATHER.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.260
SO WHEN SHE BROKE UP WITH ME,

16:33.260 --> 16:35.228
SO DID HE.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.129
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

16:36.129 --> 16:37.297
GOOGLE ME.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.699
>> DON'T THINK I WON'T.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.401
WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?

16:41.401 --> 16:44.504
>> TYPE IN "JOE 'TRAINWRECK'

16:44.504 --> 16:46.773
MASON."

16:46.773 --> 16:48.208
>> "TRAINWRECK?"

16:48.208 --> 16:51.811
>> YEAH, I HIT HARD.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.181
16 AND 4.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.348
HUH.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.183
RESPECTABLE.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.417
>> AND IF I WIN THE NEXT ONE,

16:57.417 --> 16:59.286
I'M IN TITLE CONTENTION.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.555
BUT IF I LOSE, AT MY AGE, I'M

17:02.555 --> 17:03.290
OUT OF IT.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.558
>> LOOK, I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD

17:05.558 --> 17:06.626
BREAKUPS CAN BE.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.328
AND I REALLY UNDERSTAND ABOUT

17:08.328 --> 17:09.496
TRYING TO MAKE YOUR CAREER

17:09.496 --> 17:10.297
HAPPEN.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.498
BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE

17:11.498 --> 17:12.532
RIGHT TO SQUAT IN SOMEONE

17:12.532 --> 17:13.400
ELSE'S PLACE.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.202
>> HOW IS THIS HURTING ANYBODY?

17:15.202 --> 17:16.303
I MEAN, I KEEP UP THE BASIC

17:16.303 --> 17:18.438
MAINTENANCE, TEND TO THE YARD,

17:18.438 --> 17:20.207
KEEP DRUG DEALERS AND CRACKHEADS

17:20.207 --> 17:21.208
OUT.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.509
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE HOUSE A FEW

17:22.509 --> 17:24.344
DOORS DOWN THAT'S VACANT TOO.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.678
DON'T YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE?

17:25.678 --> 17:26.546
>> YEAH, BUT--

17:26.546 --> 17:28.415
>> AND I'M WILLING TO DO EVEN

17:28.415 --> 17:29.682
MORE WORK IF YOU WANT.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.851
ANYTHING TO HELP ME KEEP MY EYES

17:31.851 --> 17:33.220
ON THE PRIZE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE

17:33.220 --> 17:35.722
OF WEEKS.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.656
>> WELL, LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE AS

17:36.656 --> 17:38.425
GOOD WITH A PAINTBRUSH AS YOU

17:38.425 --> 17:40.093
ARE WITH A PUNCHING BAG.

17:40.093 --> 17:40.827
>> THANK YOU, KEISHA.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.097
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.835
>> [softly] KEISHA, STOP STARING

17:48.835 --> 17:49.869
AT THE MAN.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.173
JUST TURN AROUND AND LEAVE.

17:53.173 --> 17:53.840
KEISHA!

17:53.840 --> 17:54.841
UH, RIGHT.

17:54.841 --> 17:55.808

17:56.809 --> 17:57.677
>> * SCREAM IF YOU WANNA GO

17:57.677 --> 17:58.811
* FASTER

17:58.811 --> 18:00.413
>> THAT IS NOT A BLANKET.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.714
RESPECT THE CASHMERE.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.150
>> I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.284
GET ME SOME HEAT, AND YOU'LL GET

18:04.284 --> 18:04.817
YOUR JACKET.

18:04.817 --> 18:08.355
STOP.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.892
[door opens]

18:12.892 --> 18:14.294
>> SO WHAT'S UP WITH THE

18:14.294 --> 18:15.595
TEMPERATURE SWINGS?

18:15.595 --> 18:16.696
IT'D BE NICE TO KNOW IF I'M

18:16.696 --> 18:17.330
STILL GOING TO HAVE FINGERS AND

18:17.330 --> 18:18.365
TOES IN THE MORNING.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.332
>> I'VE GOT TO REPLACE THE WHOLE

18:19.332 --> 18:20.667
HEATING SYSTEM.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.336
SO NO RAISE ANY TIME SOON.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.337
SORRY.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.706
>> [sighs]

18:26.706 --> 18:28.275
>> HEY.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.276
>> HEY.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.777
>> OKAY, I NEED YOU GUYS TO

18:30.777 --> 18:32.445
TASTE THESE VODKAS.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.546
>> AND I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO PUT

18:33.546 --> 18:34.581
ON SOME HOUSE MUSIC.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.149
>> WHY ARE WE DRINKING VODKA IN

18:36.149 --> 18:36.783
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.151
AND DO WE HAVE ANY CRANBERRY

18:38.151 --> 18:38.685
JUICE?

18:38.685 --> 18:39.519
>> HEY, IT'S HAPPY HOUR

18:39.519 --> 18:40.520
SOMEWHERE.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.288
>> ALL RIGHT.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.522
I WANT TO SEE IF YOU GUYS CAN

18:42.522 --> 18:43.523
TASTE THE DIFFERENCE.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.924
BECAUSE ONE OF MY VIPs AT

18:44.924 --> 18:46.493
CLUB PULSE COMPLAINED, AND WHEN

18:46.493 --> 18:47.760
I TALKED TO THE OWNER, I FOUND

18:47.760 --> 18:49.296
OUT THEY'RE PASSING OFF GENERIC

18:49.296 --> 18:50.697
VODKA FOR TOP-SHELF.

18:50.697 --> 18:51.864
>> SOUNDS PRETTY SHADY.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.300
>> WELL, NO, LET'S NOT GET HASTY

18:53.300 --> 18:53.933
WITH OUR JUDGMENTS, OMAR.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.368
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS PEOPLE

18:55.368 --> 18:56.236
USUALLY CAN'T TELL THE

18:56.236 --> 18:56.769
DIFFERENCE.

18:56.769 --> 18:57.504
>> PLEASE.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.571
YOU JUST WANT US TO MAKE YOU

18:58.571 --> 18:59.872
FEEL OKAY ABOUT RIPPING PEOPLE

18:59.872 --> 19:00.607
OFF.

19:00.607 --> 19:01.674
>> WELL, KIND OF, BUT WHEN YOU

19:01.674 --> 19:02.575
PUT IT LIKE THAT, IT SOUNDS

19:02.575 --> 19:03.310
HORRIBLE.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.477
>> WELL, ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT,

19:04.477 --> 19:06.379
BOTTLE SERVICE IS A SCAM.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.780
BUT SINCE MOST FOLKS ORDERING IT

19:07.780 --> 19:09.482
ONLY WANT TO BE SEEN, THEY DON'T

19:09.482 --> 19:10.450
CARE WHAT THEY'RE DRINKING.

19:10.450 --> 19:14.887
PASS ME A LIME.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.856
>> WELL, CAN YOU TELL WHICH IS

19:16.856 --> 19:17.557
WHICH?

19:17.557 --> 19:18.891
>> ALL I CAN TELL IS I'M WARM

19:18.891 --> 19:20.227
AND FUZZY ON THE INSIDE, AND

19:20.227 --> 19:21.561
I WANNA DANCE WITH SOMEBODY.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.795
BOTH WORK FOR ME.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.264
>> OOH.

19:24.264 --> 19:24.831
I DON'T NEED TO PUT THIS

19:24.831 --> 19:26.433
ANYWHERE NEAR MY LIPS TO KNOW

19:26.433 --> 19:27.600
THIS IS THE CHEAP STUFF.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.669
I CAN SMELL IT A MILE AWAY.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.970
>> ISN'T VODKA ODORLESS?

19:30.970 --> 19:32.439
>> YEAH, BUT CHEAPNESS AIN'T.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.740
>> IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR NOT TO

19:33.740 --> 19:35.242
GIVE SOMEBODY WHAT THEY PAY FOR.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.443
>> BUSINESSES MARK UP STUFF ALL

19:36.443 --> 19:37.244
THE TIME.

19:37.244 --> 19:37.977
YOU DO IT HERE TOO.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.912
I MEAN, NO WAY ARE THESE PUMPS

19:39.912 --> 19:41.814
REALLY WORTH $900.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.715
>> [gasps]

19:42.715 --> 19:44.251
>> AND PLENTY OF PEOPLE LIKE

19:44.251 --> 19:45.452
KNOCKOFFS.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.254
I MEAN, LOOK AT OMAR'S FAKE

19:47.254 --> 19:48.588
GUCCI LOAFERS.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.689
>> [whispers] YOU CAN TELL?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.291
>> YES, BUT MAYBE LIKE OMAR,

19:51.291 --> 19:52.359
PEOPLE JUST WANT EVERYONE TO

19:52.359 --> 19:53.326
THINK THAT THEY CAN AFFORD IT.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.994
>> AGAIN, I REFERENCE HIS

19:54.994 --> 19:56.596
SWEATER.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.697
>> LOOK.

19:57.697 --> 19:58.831
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TOUGH

19:58.831 --> 19:59.832
CHOICES AN INDEPENDENT

19:59.832 --> 20:01.301
BUSINESSWOMAN HAS TO MAKE, BUT

20:01.301 --> 20:02.369
DON'T YOU THINK IT COMES DOWN

20:02.369 --> 20:03.303
TO INTEGRITY?

20:03.303 --> 20:04.271
>> GIRL, I SAY, DON'T WORRY.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.706
TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.844
>> SO WHAT YOU THINK?

20:11.844 --> 20:13.446
>> WHEN YOU SAID "BAD BOYS,"

20:13.446 --> 20:15.615
I WAS THINKING WILL SMITH,

20:15.615 --> 20:16.783
MARTIN LAWRENCE, AND A FEW

20:16.783 --> 20:17.550
JOKES.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.886
NOT ESAI MORALES AND SEAN PENN

20:19.886 --> 20:22.255
TERRORIZING EACH OTHER IN JAIL.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.723
>> WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS WEIRD

20:23.723 --> 20:24.824
WHEN YOU SUGGESTED I BRING

20:24.824 --> 20:25.592
MY DVD.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.460
>> WELL, YOU SAID IT WAS ONE OF

20:27.460 --> 20:28.628
YOUR FAVORITES, SO I WANTED TO

20:28.628 --> 20:30.763
SHARE THE EXPERIENCE WITH YOU.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.366
>> OH, MAMI, YOU'RE SO SWEET.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.568
BUT I'M STILL NOT GOING TO WATCH

20:35.568 --> 20:37.904
THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.339
>> [laughing]

20:39.339 --> 20:42.975
>> NO WAY.

20:42.975 --> 20:46.913
YOU KNOW, THIS MEANT A LOT THAT

20:46.913 --> 20:49.582
YOU MADE THE NIGHT ALL ABOUT ME.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.652
NOW I WANT TO MAKE IT ALL ABOUT

20:52.652 --> 20:54.321
YOU.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.522
CAN I?

20:55.522 --> 20:57.524
>> [giggling]

21:04.731 --> 21:10.570

21:18.645 --> 21:20.613
>> [sighs]

21:26.619 --> 21:29.556
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:29.556 --> 21:31.858
>> I'M, UM, REMINDING MYSELF

21:31.858 --> 21:34.994
ABOUT THE 12 STEPS.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.830
>> 12 STEPS?

21:37.830 --> 21:40.467
>> [sighs]

21:40.467 --> 21:44.036
RAQUEL...

21:44.036 --> 21:46.573
I'M A SEX ADDICT.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.007
>> OH.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.609
LIKE, DIAGNOSED?

21:49.609 --> 21:50.910
>> YEAH.

21:50.910 --> 21:54.647
AND I WAS DOING SO WELL UNTIL...

21:54.647 --> 21:55.948
YOU.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.785
>> I--

21:58.785 --> 22:00.487
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND TO

22:00.487 --> 22:01.020
THIS.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.021
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A--

22:02.021 --> 22:03.523
>> YEARS.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.757
DURING THE WORST OF IT, I

22:04.757 --> 22:06.593
COULDN'T KEEP A STEADY JOB OR

22:06.593 --> 22:07.727
RELATIONSHIP.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.061
BUT I HAVE A SPONSOR NOW.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.897
AND PART OF MY TREATMENT WAS

22:10.897 --> 22:12.999
TO BE CELIBATE FOR SIX MONTHS.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.501
>> OH.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.936
SO YOUR SIX MONTHS WERE UP THAT

22:16.936 --> 22:18.438
DAY AT THE STABLE, RIGHT?

22:18.438 --> 22:19.839
>> NOPE.

22:19.839 --> 22:24.611
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DAY 152.

22:24.611 --> 22:26.846
I ONLY HAD 28 DAYS LEFT.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.981
NOW I'M BACK AT ZERO.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.950
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK IF I CAN

22:30.950 --> 22:33.720
ABSTAIN FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS,

22:33.720 --> 22:34.721
THEN MAYBE THIS COULD BE A

22:34.721 --> 22:35.955
HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP FOR ME.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.657
>> SO THAT'S THE REAL REASON WHY

22:37.657 --> 22:38.625
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE SEX THE

22:38.625 --> 22:39.459
OTHER NIGHT.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.794
ANTONIO, THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS.

22:41.794 --> 22:42.829
WE SHOULD PROBABLY PUT SOME

22:42.829 --> 22:45.798
CLOTHES ON.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.140
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING NOW?

22:54.140 --> 22:55.141
>> THAT I'M THE REASON YOU FELL

22:55.141 --> 22:55.875
OFF THE WAGON.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.109
I FEEL HORRIBLE.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.945
ALL I WANT TO DO IS BE NEXT TO

22:58.945 --> 23:01.180
YOU IN EVERY WAY.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.682
>> OH, NO, NO.

23:02.682 --> 23:03.516
IT'S NOT YOU.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.518
IT'S ME.

23:05.518 --> 23:06.786
GOD, I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU

23:06.786 --> 23:10.690
SOONER.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.959
>> WELL, I CARE ABOUT YOU, AND

23:12.959 --> 23:15.628
I WANT TO HELP.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.130
I JUST NEED YOU TO SHOW ME HOW.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.738
>> TWO CHOCOLATE CAKES, FIVE

23:25.738 --> 23:27.106
SPOONS, CAPPUCCINOS ALL AROUND.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.876
APRIL LIKES CAPPUCCINO, RIGHT?

23:29.876 --> 23:30.877
>> TONIGHT, IT'S LOOKING MORE

23:30.877 --> 23:32.211
LIKE A VANILLA LATTE.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.946
>> WELL, APRIL NEEDS TO GET BACK

23:33.946 --> 23:35.915
OVER HERE BECAUSE I HAVE AN

23:35.915 --> 23:37.016
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.551
>> OH, I'M GETTING A WAVE FROM

23:38.551 --> 23:39.151
MY FRIENDS.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.587
>> OH, OKAY.

23:40.587 --> 23:41.488
>> NO, REALLY.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.022
OTHERWISE, I WOULD STAY.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.091
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.526
CALL ME.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.194
>> OH.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.662
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.030
I'M SORRY IF I GAVE YOU MIXED

23:51.030 --> 23:51.931
SIGNALS.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.533
I'M JUST A FRIENDLY GUY.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.034
BUT I'M SURE YOU'LL MEET SOMEONE

23:55.034 --> 23:55.768
SOON.

23:55.768 --> 23:56.569
>> OH.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.136
OKAY.

23:57.136 --> 24:00.573
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.775
>> THAT'S MY--

24:02.775 --> 24:03.876
OKAY.

24:03.876 --> 24:04.911
SO HE WAS CUTE.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.112
WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING ON

24:06.112 --> 24:08.781
A DATE?

24:08.781 --> 24:11.484
>> UH-UH-UH-UH.

24:11.484 --> 24:12.018
>> UM...

24:12.018 --> 24:12.752
[clears throat]

24:12.752 --> 24:14.521
[clinking glass]

24:14.521 --> 24:18.157
SO I KNOW THAT OMAR AND I HAVE

24:18.157 --> 24:19.191
ONLY BEEN BACK TOGETHER FOR A

24:19.191 --> 24:20.092
FEW MONTHS.

24:20.092 --> 24:20.993
>> [gulping]

24:20.993 --> 24:24.096
>> BUT WHEN IT'S RIGHT,

24:24.096 --> 24:26.866
IT'S RIGHT.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.668
OMAR.

24:28.668 --> 24:33.640
I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.173
>> [gasps]

24:34.173 --> 24:36.042
>> WOULD YOU PLEASE DO ME THE

24:36.042 --> 24:41.581
HONOR OF BECOMING MY HUSBAND?

24:44.917 --> 24:47.186
>> I LOVE IT.

24:47.186 --> 24:51.791
AND YOU.

24:51.791 --> 24:52.592
YES.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.626
>> YES?

24:53.626 --> 24:56.963
>> DEREK, I WILL MARRY YOU.

25:01.801 --> 25:02.769
>> [chuckles]

25:10.610 --> 25:12.579
>> HEY, JOE.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.013
OH.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.115
I GOTTA SAY, YOU'VE DONE SOME

25:16.115 --> 25:17.283
VERY NICE WORK HERE.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.117
>> TOLD YOU.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.752
>> AH, YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAVE

25:19.752 --> 25:21.020
SOME OF THAT COCKINESS FOR THE

25:21.020 --> 25:22.188
RING, TRAINWRECK.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.289
>> YEAH, NO NEED.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.657
I GOT PLENTY TO SPARE.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.659
>> [laughs] I'M SURE YOU DO.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.094
SO IF YOU COULD BE OUT BY THE

25:28.094 --> 25:29.562
END OF THE DAY, THAT WOULD BE

25:29.562 --> 25:30.096
GREAT.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.731
I HAVE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS COMING

25:31.731 --> 25:32.865
OVER TOMORROW MORNING.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.300
>> ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA NEED

25:34.300 --> 25:35.635
A FEW MORE WEEKS.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.303
THEY MOVED THE DATE OF MY BOUT.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.639
>> I HEAR YOU, JOE, BUT THAT

25:39.639 --> 25:40.607
WASN'T OUR DEAL.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.941
>> LOOK, KEISHA, I KNOW YOU'RE

25:41.941 --> 25:43.710
JUST DOING YOUR JOB, BUT IF

25:43.710 --> 25:45.044
YOU'RE GOING TO PUSH ME, I KNOW

25:45.044 --> 25:45.912
MY RIGHTS.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.580
>> WHAT RIGHTS?

25:47.580 --> 25:49.782
>> SQUATTER'S RIGHTS.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.083
I'VE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR WEEKS,

25:51.083 --> 25:52.318
SO TECHNICALLY, THE LAW'S ON MY

25:52.318 --> 25:53.052
SIDE.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.320
YOU'LL NEED A COURT ORDER TO GET

25:54.320 --> 25:56.288
ME OUT OF HERE, AND THAT'LL TAKE

25:56.288 --> 25:56.989
MONTHS.

25:56.989 --> 25:58.090
>> SO IT'S LIKE THAT?

25:58.090 --> 25:59.291
>> YEAH.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.993
IT'S LIKE THAT.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.294
>> OKAY, JOE.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.596
YOU STAY.

26:03.596 --> 26:04.997
YOU STAY RIGHT HERE.

26:04.997 --> 26:08.601
BUT DON'T THINK THIS IS OVER.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.644
>> * SO YOUNG AND COMPLICATED

26:17.644 --> 26:19.946
* ALL SASS AND MOTIVATED

26:19.946 --> 26:21.380
>> CAN YOU HAND ME THOSE

26:21.380 --> 26:26.719
DRESSES, PLEASE?

26:26.719 --> 26:27.754
>> I DON'T GET IT.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.055
JUST THE OTHER DAY, YOU WERE

26:29.055 --> 26:30.289
VEHEMENT ABOUT NOT GETTING

26:30.289 --> 26:31.290
MARRIED.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.324
NOW YOU'RE BLINDING US WITH THAT

26:32.324 --> 26:33.059
RING.

26:33.059 --> 26:33.826
WHAT GIVES?

26:33.826 --> 26:35.327
>> OKAY, SO I STILL THINK THE

26:35.327 --> 26:36.195
WHOLE MARRIAGE THING IS

26:36.195 --> 26:37.196
UNNECESSARY.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.865
BUT DAM DEREK GIVES GOOD

26:38.865 --> 26:39.932
RING!

26:39.932 --> 26:40.833
>> [scoffs]

26:40.833 --> 26:42.301
>> I KNOW, I'M SHALLOW, BUT IT'S

26:42.301 --> 26:44.370
SO PRETTY.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.906
SO I'M THINKING I CAN CONVINCE

26:46.906 --> 26:48.675
HIM TO CONSIDER IT A PROMISE

26:48.675 --> 26:49.208
RING.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.410
LIKE, I PROMISE TO THINK ABOUT

26:51.410 --> 26:52.344
MARRIAGE ONE DAY.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.813
>> AND I PROMISE YOU DEREK WILL

26:53.813 --> 26:55.147
YANK THAT RING RIGHT OFF THAT

26:55.147 --> 26:57.149
SHALLOW LITTLE FINGER THE SECOND

26:57.149 --> 26:58.284
HE HEARS THAT BULL.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.786
>> I DON'T SEE ANYONE PUTTING

26:59.786 --> 27:01.120
ANY ROCKS ON YOUR FINGER,

27:01.120 --> 27:01.854
KEISHA.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.656
DID MALCOLM OR SEAN OR ANYONE

27:03.656 --> 27:06.392
ELSE PROPOSE TO YOU LATELY, HMM?

27:06.392 --> 27:07.760
DIDN'T THINK SO.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.427
I'M THE QUEEN, BITCH.

27:08.427 --> 27:09.328
KISS THE RING.

27:09.328 --> 27:10.162
>> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN

27:10.162 --> 27:10.930
KISS.

27:10.930 --> 27:11.664
>> OH.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.332
I GOT A CUSTOMER.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.401
>> KEISHA.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.703
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU

27:16.703 --> 27:17.336
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

27:17.336 --> 27:19.305
WEIGHING ON ME.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.306
>> YEAH.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.142
WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

27:23.142 --> 27:24.343
>> THE OTHER NIGHT I FOUND OUT

27:24.343 --> 27:25.978
ANTONIO HAS AN ADDICTION.

27:25.978 --> 27:30.382
NOT TO DRUGS, NOT TO ALCOHOL,

27:30.382 --> 27:32.218
BUT TO SEX.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.220
>> GIRL, YOU KNOW HOW MEN ARE.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.755
THEY ALL GET ADDICTED TO IT AT

27:35.755 --> 27:36.322
SOME POINT.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.824
I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.025
THE ONES WHO JONES FOR IT

27:39.025 --> 27:40.392
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT

27:40.392 --> 27:41.327
OR THE ONES WHO GOT IT AND

27:41.327 --> 27:42.094
CAN'T LET GO.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.930
>> NO, HE'S A SERIOUS,

27:43.930 --> 27:45.297
FULL-BLOWN ADDICT WITH

27:45.297 --> 27:48.334
A SPONSOR, MEETINGS, EVERYTHING.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.902
>> OH.

27:49.902 --> 27:50.803
HOW DID HE TAKE IT WHEN YOU

27:50.803 --> 27:51.938
BROKE UP WITH HIM?

27:51.938 --> 27:53.005
>> I DIDN'T.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.142
>> RAQUEL, HAVING A HEALTHY

27:56.142 --> 27:57.309
RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ADDICT IS

27:57.309 --> 27:59.211
LIKE HEARING A SONG WITHOUT

27:59.211 --> 28:00.212
LIL WAYNE ON IT.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.948
KIND OF IMPOSSIBLE.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.149
>> WHAT MAKES YOU SUCH AN EXPERT

28:03.149 --> 28:04.150
ON THE SUBJECT?

28:04.150 --> 28:06.018
>> SEX REHAB WITH DR. DREW.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.486
BUT I DID LEARN A LOT.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.823
AND THIS ISSUE ANTONIO HAS...

28:10.823 --> 28:12.124
[sighs] IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

28:12.124 --> 28:12.892
EASY.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.226
>> I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

28:14.226 --> 28:16.495
BUT I FEEL LIKE ANTONIO AND I

28:16.495 --> 28:17.363
HAVE SOMETHING.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.965
WE NEVER GOT TO EXPLORE IT WHEN

28:18.965 --> 28:21.233
WE WERE YOUNGER, BUT NOW THAT

28:21.233 --> 28:22.735
HE'S BACK IN MY LIFE, I'M NOT

28:22.735 --> 28:23.335
JUST GOING TO KICK HIM TO THE

28:23.335 --> 28:24.370
CURB BECAUSE I'M FACED WITH A

28:24.370 --> 28:25.204
CHALLENGE.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.205
>> I HAVE TO RESPECT THAT YOU'RE

28:26.205 --> 28:27.239
WILLING TO WORK WITH HIM ON

28:27.239 --> 28:27.974
THIS.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.241
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED

28:29.241 --> 28:30.376
TO DO WHEN THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.011
I JUST WISH CERTAIN PEOPLE KNEW

28:32.011 --> 28:35.047
THAT.

28:35.047 --> 28:38.017
[knocking on door]

28:40.452 --> 28:42.889
HEY, WHAT BRINGS YOU BY TONIGHT?

28:42.889 --> 28:44.523
>> WELL, NOT ONLY HAVE I CAUGHT

28:44.523 --> 28:46.192
UP ON MY EMAIL, BILLS, AND

28:46.192 --> 28:47.259
CLEANED EVERY INCH OF MY

28:47.259 --> 28:48.861
APARTMENT, I EVEN WATCHED KEN

28:48.861 --> 28:51.030
BURNS'S JAZZ DOCUMENTARY.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.765
LIKE, ALL OF IT.

28:52.765 --> 28:53.933
DO YOU WANT TO HANG OUT TONIGHT?

28:53.933 --> 28:56.102
>> OH, I WISH I COULD, BUT I

28:56.102 --> 28:57.403
HAVE A WORK MIXER WITH ANN.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.370
RAIN CHECK?

28:58.370 --> 28:59.371
>> YEAH, SURE.

28:59.371 --> 29:00.106
>> OKAY.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.374
>> WHENEVER.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.210
>> WHOA, HOLD UP.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.245
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

29:06.245 --> 29:07.880
>> MAYBE I'M BEING PARANOID AND

29:07.880 --> 29:09.081
ALL EMOTIONAL.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.249
IT'S BAD ENOUGH I CAN'T GET A

29:10.249 --> 29:11.483
DATE, BUT NOW I'M WORRIED THAT

29:11.483 --> 29:12.384
I'M NOT CONNECTING WITH MY

29:12.384 --> 29:13.119
FRIENDS EITHER.

29:13.119 --> 29:13.886
>> LIKE WHO?

29:13.886 --> 29:16.222
>> LIKE YOU.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.857
I REALLY MISS YOU, KEISH.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.225
WE DON'T HANG OUT HALF AS MUCH

29:19.225 --> 29:19.959
AS WE USED TO.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.060
AND I WONDER THAT NOW THAT VAL

29:21.060 --> 29:21.961
IS GONE AND RAQUEL'S BACK IN

29:21.961 --> 29:23.262
THE PICTURE, IF YOU EVEN WANT TO

29:23.262 --> 29:24.496
SPEND TIME WITH ME ANYMORE.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.967
>> GIRL, LET ME HUG THE SILLY

29:27.967 --> 29:29.836
OUT OF YOU.

29:29.836 --> 29:30.870
HMM.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.171
[grunts]

29:32.171 --> 29:34.540
WHEN VAL INTRODUCED US, I WAS

29:34.540 --> 29:36.508
LIKE, "WHO IS THIS KOOKY LITTLE

29:36.508 --> 29:37.910
BLONDE GIRL?"

29:37.910 --> 29:39.979
BUT YOU WERE SO SWEET, AND WE

29:39.979 --> 29:41.013
BECAME FRIENDS.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.148
AND THAT'S NEVER GOING TO

29:42.148 --> 29:43.582
CHANGE BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

29:43.582 --> 29:47.019
LET'S PLAN A GIRL DATE, JUST ME

29:47.019 --> 29:47.553
AND YOU.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.088
>> THAT IS THE BEST OFFER I'VE

29:49.088 --> 29:50.389
HAD IN WEEKS.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.891
THANKS.

29:51.891 --> 29:52.491
I LOVE YOU TOO.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.259
>> MM.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.126
MM.

29:54.126 --> 29:54.961
NOW GO ON AND GO AND LET ME

29:54.961 --> 29:56.095
FINISH GETTING READY, SO I CAN

29:56.095 --> 29:57.296
MINGLE MY WAY TO MILLIONS.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.998
THEN I'LL HAVE ALL THE FREE

REALLY THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE

34:22.094 --> 34:22.694
GOING TO SAY NO.

34:22.694 --> 34:23.562
AND THEN WHEN YOU DIDN'T--

34:23.562 --> 34:24.396
>> YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HURT MY

34:24.396 --> 34:27.366
FEELINGS?

34:31.837 --> 34:33.739
SAME HERE.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.641
>> WELL, ONE THING'S CLEAR.

34:35.641 --> 34:36.808
WE'RE NOT READY FOR THAT TYPE

34:36.808 --> 34:37.709
OF COMMITMENT.

>> WHEN I WASN'T THINKING,

34:38.810 --> 34:40.879
"WHAT A GREAT RING," I WAS

DOING SO WELL UNTIL YOU CAME

37:50.336 --> 37:51.703
INTO THE PICTURE.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.308
REMOVE MYSELF FROM ANY SITUATION

38:03.014 --> 38:05.884
>> WHY?

38:05.884 --> 38:07.419
CAN'T WE JUST BE CELIBATE?

38:07.419 --> 38:08.520
I TOLD YOU, I WOULD DO WHATEVER

38:08.520 --> 38:09.855
I COULD TO SUPPORT YOU.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.990
>> I WISH IT WAS THAT EASY.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.925
I-I THOUGHT I COULD CONTROL IT,

38:13.925 --> 38:15.627
ESPECIALLY AFTER I ADMITTED IT

38:15.627 --> 38:16.928
TO YOU.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.029
BUT IT'S LIKE ONCE I HAD A

38:18.029 --> 38:19.798
TASTE, I COULDN'T STOP.

38:19.798 --> 38:20.866
>> WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS,

38:32.444 --> 38:34.346
EX DID TO YOU.

38:34.346 --> 38:35.514
BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO END
