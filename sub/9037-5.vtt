WEBVTT

00:04.371 --> 00:06.405
- Golf again?

00:06.407 --> 00:07.506
I could walk through
here naked.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.540
You wouldn't even notice.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.011
- You're not tiger woods.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.783
21 years old.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.352
You know,
he started when he was three.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.421
- I should have
been out there when I was three.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.223
What the hell was I thinking?

00:25.658 --> 00:26.658
Unbelievable.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.227
- He's amazing.
- Oh, man.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.795
- What is that,
three wins already this year?

00:29.797 --> 00:31.263
- That's four.
That's four.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.263
- Where's he going?

00:32.265 --> 00:35.067
- Where he always goes--
to hug his father, you idiot.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.168
- All right,
take it easy.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.270
- An embrace
with his father earl.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.775
An emotional moment here.

00:46.279 --> 00:47.813
Father and son.

00:52.819 --> 00:53.819
Quite powerful.

01:02.695 --> 01:05.631
- Got to check the car.
- Yeah.

01:05.633 --> 01:06.765
Do you want a soda?
- Yeah.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.766
- All right.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.809
- Ray, did you check
michael's diaper?

01:16.811 --> 01:18.143
- I think he's okay.

01:26.586 --> 01:30.522
- Man, I don't even
think I could pass that test.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.491
- Oh, man, it's hard
to watch golf

01:32.493 --> 01:33.792
'cause I just want
to get out there and play.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.327
- I know, me too.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.628
- Hmm.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.630
- Let's go.
Let's go tomorrow.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.532
- No, no, I can't tell debra
I want to go golfing now.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.534
I just got back
from five days on the road.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.702
- Just see what she says, ray.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.738
- No, I'll get in trouble
just for asking.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.341
I'm not even gonna try.

01:49.343 --> 01:52.811
You know what we could do?

01:52.813 --> 01:54.880
If you ask me in front of her

01:54.882 --> 01:57.816
As if you're asking me
for the first time, right,

01:57.818 --> 02:00.119
And then
I'll turn you down.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.554
She'll think that
I'm being thoughtful, you know,

02:02.556 --> 02:06.325
And then we just hope
santa takes the cookies.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.393
- Oh, yeah, I like it.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.628
Let's do it.
Let's try it.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.630
- As soon as she comes down,
we'll do it.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.664
Sit.
Don't--

02:12.666 --> 02:14.266
Look normal.
Don't do anything.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.434
Are you gonna put your foot up?

02:15.436 --> 02:16.435
- I don't have to.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.203
- No, you put yours up.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.638
Put the popcorn here.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.839
Soon as she comes down.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.512
- You want me to make a noise?

02:26.514 --> 02:27.846
- What do you mean,
"make a noise"?

02:27.848 --> 02:28.847
She's not geese.

02:28.849 --> 02:29.715
Just relax.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.391
- Supposed to be nice
tomorrow, ray.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.392
- Oh, yeah?

02:40.394 --> 02:41.426
I heard.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.732
- Hey, we should go golfing.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.934
- Yeah, tomorrow?

02:48.936 --> 02:52.171
No, no, I just got back
from the road.

02:52.173 --> 02:52.771
I want to be home.

02:57.677 --> 02:58.677
[groans]

03:01.214 --> 03:02.481
Good to be home.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.485
- Come on,
we'll go to westchester.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.553
They just resodded.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.787
- Did they?
Did they resod that?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.255
- New grass.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.691
- Oh, man, sounds great,
but I can't.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.426
I can't go golfing.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.527
- No, no, no,
I'm reading that.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.528
- Oh, sorry.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.300
So I can't, kevin.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.971
Maybe some other time.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.777
- Some other time
we might not get out for free.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.480
- Free?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.420
- My buddy mike, he works down
at the pro shop.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.421
He can comp us.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.489
You know, save us 100 bucks.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.391
- It's not about the money.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.994
I've been gone for a week.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.929
Nah, I can't.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.698
- I think you should go, ray.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.899
- Nah...

03:53.901 --> 03:56.001
Yeah?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.369
I just got back
from the road.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.870
I want to--
yeah?

03:58.872 --> 04:01.773
- Well...

04:01.775 --> 04:03.408
You know, I mean,
if you guys can save 100 bucks,

04:03.410 --> 04:04.643
Then, yeah, go,

04:04.645 --> 04:06.011
But then maybe you could
lay off the golf

04:06.013 --> 04:06.912
For a while after that, okay?

04:06.914 --> 04:08.313
- Okay.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.313
- And I mean, you know,

04:09.315 --> 04:12.985
Playing golf,
golf on tv, computer golf.

04:12.987 --> 04:13.986
Dorf on golf.

04:13.988 --> 04:15.554
- Of course.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.556
Of course, I don't--

04:17.558 --> 04:18.790
Kevin.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.392
- We're in.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.394
- Yeah, but what are you doing
saying it's for free?

04:22.396 --> 04:24.796
- Ray, it wasn't working.
I had to add a little sauce.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.598
Hey, what's the difference?
We're going golfing.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.633
- We are.
I know.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.633
Told you it would work.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.369
- No, I knew it was
going to work.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.503
- You're choking me.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.410
Whoa!

04:38.412 --> 04:39.411
I got to take a shower.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.614
I smell like the winner.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.883
- I didn't have
my best game out there.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.385
- Yeah, well, that happens.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.786
You know, robert,

04:47.788 --> 04:50.489
You can't curse
that loud on a golf course.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.757
- Yep, you're right.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.425
It's just a game.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.326
You know, it's just--

04:54.328 --> 04:55.661
Come on!

05:00.700 --> 05:02.901
Sorry.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.770
- Hey, hey, you guys
want to play another nine?

05:04.772 --> 05:06.338
- I'm ready.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.572
- Let's go!

05:07.574 --> 05:08.573
- Don't you have
to go home?

05:08.575 --> 05:09.975
- Oh, I--
uh, I should.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.009
Debra's waiting.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.544
But you know what?
We're so early.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.679
If we hurry up--
we stop talking--

05:13.681 --> 05:15.380
We can get nine more in,

05:15.382 --> 05:18.417
And she won't know
the difference.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.918
- I'm gonna need some tees.
I need some tees.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.520
- Okay, I just need
five more balls.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.055
- Yeah, well, stop taking them
from my bag.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.523
- I'll give them to you.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.091
- I'm feeling, like,
flushed all of a sudden.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.492
- No, let's go.
Let's go.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.960
- No, I mean I'm, like,
a little jumpy here.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.729
- Yeah, me too. Come on.
Let's get out there.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.930
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.965
I'm not feeling right here.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.567
- Well, what is it, raymond?

05:35.569 --> 05:38.537
- I don't know.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.572
Something's going on here.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.907
- You have any tingling
in your left arm

05:41.909 --> 05:42.974
Or chest pains?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.676
- Uh-uh.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.813
- Well, it's not a heart attack.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.716
- All right,
let's get going then.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.087
- Back up a little, will you?
Back up.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.488
Come on, give me room.
Give me room.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.823
- How far do you want us to go?

05:57.825 --> 05:59.458
- I'm--I'm feeling
crowded in here.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.659
- Ray, relax.
You just got to relax.

06:00.661 --> 06:01.659
- Yeah, sit down.

06:01.661 --> 06:02.928
- Would you shut up
for a second?

06:02.930 --> 06:05.063
- Get him some water.

06:05.065 --> 06:09.768
- Make it a ginger ale!

06:09.770 --> 06:11.103
- Yeah, I'm gonna need
a dollar.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.443
- Hey, ray, have a seat.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.579
- Oh, boy.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.448
What's that supposed to mean?

06:23.450 --> 06:26.985
- It means
you're welcome to sit.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.954
Let's see.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.856
Your ekg's fine.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.425
Blood pressure is fine.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.527
Hey, did I see your brother
robert in the waiting room?

06:35.529 --> 06:36.528
- Yeah.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.629
- How are his feet doing?

06:37.631 --> 06:38.697
Have they cleared up yet?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.935
- It's been a while since
I've seen his feet, really.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.404
- I'll tell you,

06:45.406 --> 06:47.939
That was an uphill battle.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.041
Anyway, ray,
from what I see here,

06:50.043 --> 06:52.043
You're in good health.

06:52.045 --> 06:55.147
I think it was nothing more
than a little anxiety.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.748
- Oh, man, is that it?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.083
What did I have,
an anxiety attack?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.652
- I prefer to call it
an episode.

07:00.654 --> 07:05.190
Robert's feet was an attack.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.559
Ray, your mind is like,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.161
For lack of a better word,

07:09.163 --> 07:13.131
A donkey.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.600
You can only throw so many bags
on its back

07:15.602 --> 07:18.703
Before it lies down
and won't get up.

07:18.705 --> 07:19.704
- Right.

07:19.706 --> 07:20.906
- Right,

07:20.908 --> 07:23.642
So you got to relieve
some of that stress.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.143
Do things that relax you.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.579
What do you enjoy doing?

07:27.581 --> 07:29.114
- Well, I--

07:29.116 --> 07:31.016
I like to golf.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.784
- Well, then, by all means,
get out there

07:32.786 --> 07:34.719
And play as much golf
as you can.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.456
- Well, wait a minute.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.792
Wait, that's where
this episode happened.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.561
- Oh, that could have
happened anywhere.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.995
You've been on the road a lot.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.931
You've got a wife,
three kids,

07:45.933 --> 07:47.732
Parents across the street.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.900
This was a long time coming.

07:52.104 --> 07:55.006
Play some golf.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.174
- Wait, so--

07:56.176 --> 07:57.709
So I have to go home

07:57.711 --> 07:59.678
And tell my wife

07:59.680 --> 08:04.683
That I need to play more golf?

08:04.685 --> 08:05.684
- Doctor's orders.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.552
- [chuckles]

08:07.554 --> 08:11.823
Okay.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.823
Let me ask you.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.894
Would I see a podiatrist
or a proctologist

08:15.896 --> 08:17.529
To get a foot
removed from my ass?

08:27.139 --> 08:29.608
- What the hell?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.010
Who's throwing
chicken bones in here?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.745
Holy crap.

08:33.747 --> 08:34.779
- Oh...

08:34.781 --> 08:39.618
Time-out for grandpa.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.652
- Frank, do you have to curse?

08:40.654 --> 08:43.588
- Do you want it fixed?

08:43.590 --> 08:46.224
Bastard chicken bones!

08:46.226 --> 08:49.928
I need my frigging
needlenose.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.196
Bones in the garbage!

08:55.801 --> 08:56.902
- So it must have
been a good game.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.770
You're two hours late.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.572
- Yeah, well,

09:00.574 --> 09:02.574
Something strange happened.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.544
- Really.
What?

09:05.546 --> 09:07.779
- After golfing, uh,

09:07.781 --> 09:09.147
We were in the locker room,

09:09.149 --> 09:11.683
And I got this weird feeling.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.818
- Oh, ray, you are not gay.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.163
- No, I know,
you told me,

09:25.165 --> 09:26.565
But this was something else.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.169
We--

09:31.171 --> 09:32.337
You know, we just--

09:32.339 --> 09:33.772
We had finished golfing--

09:33.774 --> 09:35.206
- Raymond, are you okay?

09:35.208 --> 09:37.042
Your brother told me
what happened.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.610
- "what happened"?

09:38.612 --> 09:40.011
- Tell me
what dr. Sundram said.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.646
- Oh, now, wait a minute.
Doctor?

09:41.648 --> 09:42.881
- I went to the doctor
on the way home.

09:42.883 --> 09:43.881
He said I'm fine.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.584
He said it was nothing more
than stress.

09:45.586 --> 09:46.818
That's all.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.253
- Hey, I need some room
to work here.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.253
Will you clear out?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.723
- Frank,
raymond had an attack today.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.825
- Mom, stop,
it was nothing.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.926
It was anxiety.
That's all.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.095
- An anxiety attack?
Give me a break.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.763
Everyone's having those
nowadays.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.966
It's hip.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.734
- That's not funny, frank.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.736
Our son has mental problems.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.940
- Listen, can I just
talk to ray, please?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.809
- Hey, you tell debra
about the doctor yet?

10:10.811 --> 10:11.809
- Yeah, robert.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.079
- Yeah, you tell her
what he recommended for you?

10:14.081 --> 10:15.080
- What?

10:15.082 --> 10:17.248
- Nothing, nothing,
he just--

10:17.250 --> 10:19.250
He said--the doctor said
I need to relax.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.218
That's all.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.620
Could you go?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.021
Could you guys go,
really?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.322
- All right,
I'm hungry anyway.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.690
Come on, marie.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.691
- No, feed yourself.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.793
My son needs me.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.161
- Ah, cut the cord.

10:32.732 --> 10:33.932
- Ma, please, just go.

10:33.934 --> 10:34.933
Go with dad.

10:34.935 --> 10:35.934
It's okay.
I'm fine.

10:35.936 --> 10:36.935
- All right. All right.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.069
Only if you promise me

10:38.071 --> 10:39.671
To do exactly
what the doctor said.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.672
- I will.
Please go.

10:40.674 --> 10:41.673
- Okay, okay.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.877
- Okay, so--
so what did the doctor say?

10:45.879 --> 10:48.113
What are you
supposed to--

10:48.115 --> 10:50.015
Robert, are you staying with us
for dinner?

10:50.017 --> 10:51.783
- No, no,
amy's taking me out.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.785
Someplace called jozu.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.954
- Oh, that japanese place.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.790
- Japanese?

10:58.792 --> 10:59.924
They make you take
your shoes off?

10:59.926 --> 11:00.925
- Yes.

11:06.866 --> 11:07.966
- I got to make a call.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.805
- So he told you to relax, huh?

11:13.807 --> 11:16.074
Are you gonna listen to him?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.276
- I think so.
Yes.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.079
- So what did he
tell you to do?

11:21.081 --> 11:23.348
Like, you're supposed to
take time off from work or--

11:23.350 --> 11:26.017
- No, no, no, no.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.821
Uh, he actually said

11:29.823 --> 11:30.989
What he thought
would help me

11:30.991 --> 11:35.193
Was if I played more golf.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.697
- [laughs]

11:38.699 --> 11:42.233
Dr. Sundram said,
"play more golf"?

11:42.235 --> 11:43.702
- I have a note.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.207
- He wrote you a note.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.042
- I knew you wouldn't
believe it, so I went back,

11:51.044 --> 11:52.944
And I asked him
to write it down.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.980
- "more golf."

11:55.982 --> 11:56.980
- It's very relaxing.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.717
I mean, I could get
a second opinion.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.853
- No, no, no, uh--

12:01.855 --> 12:03.988
I think that's
what you should do.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.356
- You do?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.092
- Yeah, I mean, you know,

12:07.094 --> 12:09.227
It is really stressful
around here,

12:09.229 --> 12:11.930
And, uh, if playing golf
makes you feel better,

12:11.932 --> 12:14.065
Then play golf.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.067
- Hmm.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.068
Wow!

12:17.070 --> 12:19.170
You're very nice.

12:19.172 --> 12:23.341
- Well, honey, I mean, gosh,
I want you to be okay.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.143
Listen, I'll just take care
of the kids, all right,

12:25.145 --> 12:27.245
And you sit here
before dinner and take it easy.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.880
And guess what,
I made you some lemon chicken.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.005
- Hi, debra.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.174
- Hi, marie.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.909
- The kids in school?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.377
- Yeah, yeah,

12:59.379 --> 13:01.446
I got, like, half an hour
to get everything done

13:01.448 --> 13:02.914
Before I have
to go pick them up.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.983
- Uh-huh.
Where's ray?

13:04.985 --> 13:06.885
- Oh, he's, uh, out golfing.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.886
- Oh, that's good.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.955
- Yeah.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.957
- I'm worried about you, though.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.025
[bell dings]

13:14.027 --> 13:15.193
Are you okay, honey?

13:15.195 --> 13:17.462
I mean, you look
a little drained.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.430
- Oh, you know,
I'm just a little tired.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.498
That's all.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.900
- Well, why don't you
sit down?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.101
- Well, I really can't,

13:23.103 --> 13:24.101
'cause I've got a lot
to do before--

13:24.103 --> 13:26.471
- Yeah, you can sit right down
here for just a second.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.407
Just for a minute.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.109
- Thanks.

13:31.111 --> 13:34.479
- Listen, I know this has been
hard on you, honey,

13:34.481 --> 13:37.348
And you're doing everything
you can for raymond,

13:37.350 --> 13:39.384
But maybe the way
you can help him relax

13:39.386 --> 13:40.852
Is very simple.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.220
- What do you mean?

13:42.222 --> 13:46.090
- Well, I couldn't help
wondering, dear,

13:46.092 --> 13:47.959
Are you making yourself
available to him?

14:00.206 --> 14:01.372
You know
what I'm talking about?

14:01.374 --> 14:03.308
- Please, marie!

14:03.310 --> 14:06.244
- Listen, you know raymond
doesn't like to ask for things.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.946
- Do we have
to talk about this?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.414
- I'm just trying to help.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.982
- Marie, you know,
I didn't say anything

14:10.984 --> 14:12.617
When you told me how ray liked
his underwear folded,

14:12.619 --> 14:14.319
But this is over the line.

14:14.321 --> 14:17.322
- Well, I'm sorry,
but raymond needs your help.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.057
Debra, you--

14:19.059 --> 14:20.992
Have a glass of wine
first.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.866
- Come on, ray,
you didn't lose a bet.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.368
You paid for a lesson.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.369
Hey, way to go, robert.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.971
You didn't curse once today.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.306
- Yeah, I'm getting better.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.307
Loser!

14:40.045 --> 14:41.346
- Hey, let's play nine more.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.146
- I'm in.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.017
- No, I don't want to.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.352
- Well, what do you mean?

14:47.354 --> 14:49.220
- I just--
I don't feel like playing.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.456
- Oh, no,
you're freaking out again?

14:51.458 --> 14:53.658
- Look,
I had that anxiety attack

14:53.660 --> 14:56.160
Because I tricked debra, okay?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.629
And now I'm getting
this free ride out of it

14:57.631 --> 14:58.630
That I don't deserve.

14:58.632 --> 14:59.631
I'm going home.

14:59.633 --> 15:00.665
- Just nine more.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.066
- Don't you see me out there?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.167
I'm not enjoying the game.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.603
- You're not keeping
your head down.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.071
- Look, it's enough already.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.373
I have to talk to debra.

15:16.382 --> 15:18.016
- You want to play
just you and me?

15:18.018 --> 15:20.451
- Okay, but you got to
give me more strokes.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.519
- Why, are you tired?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.054
- Nah, think my hand's broken.

15:29.328 --> 15:30.295
- Deb, I'm home.

15:33.198 --> 15:35.333
Deb, where are you?

15:35.335 --> 15:36.668
- I'm up here.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.937
In the bedroom.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.338
- Where are the kids?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.006
- They're at linda's house.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.942
- Good.
Come down, will you?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.077
I want to talk to you.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.346
- I think you might
want to come up.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.221
- It's 3:00.

15:59.425 --> 16:00.625
This can't be sex.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.126
Come down, will you?

16:04.363 --> 16:07.231
- All right, but I'll have
to put clothes on.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.232
- Coming up.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.139
Wow!

16:15.141 --> 16:19.544
That was really,
really nice.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.147
- So, yeah, it wasn't
a bad day for you, huh?

16:23.149 --> 16:25.683
This and golf.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.752
- Oh, yeah, golf.

16:27.754 --> 16:31.556
Yeah, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about before.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.257
- Okay, so tell me now.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.594
- Okay.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.330
Uh...

16:39.332 --> 16:41.566
You know the other day
when I had that episode?

16:41.568 --> 16:43.201
- Yes, you poor baby.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.635
- Yeah.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.538
I don't think it was because
I need to play more golf.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.774
I think it was because
I was feeling guilty

16:49.776 --> 16:53.077
About tricking you
into letting me play golf.

16:53.079 --> 16:53.778
- What are you talking about?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.179
I told you to go.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.148
- No, no, no, no.

16:59.385 --> 17:02.020
No, you only thought
that you did.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.222
- Ray, come on,
I was there when I said it.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.690
- Yeah, it was...

17:08.327 --> 17:11.029
Kind of a con job.
It was funny.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.296
- What?

17:12.298 --> 17:13.531
- Yeah, well,
it was the whole

17:13.533 --> 17:15.400
Kevin asking me
in front of you,

17:15.402 --> 17:17.668
Me turning him down.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.203
We kind of played you.

17:20.639 --> 17:22.040
Sorry.

17:27.513 --> 17:30.381
- So what about
the doctor's note

17:30.383 --> 17:32.183
Where he tells you
to play golf forever?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.518
- That was real.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.654
- So when you told the doctor

17:36.656 --> 17:38.322
That you tricked me

17:38.324 --> 17:40.725
Into letting you play golf,

17:40.727 --> 17:43.194
He recommended more golf?

17:50.536 --> 17:54.472
- I might have left out
the tricking part.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.840
- Really?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.341
- I was going to tell him--
- yeah.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.543
- But then
when he prescribed golf,

17:58.545 --> 18:00.278
I kind of forgot.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.148
- You forgot.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.384
You lied to me,

18:06.386 --> 18:09.153
And then, because you
feel bad about it,

18:09.155 --> 18:11.722
I have to make sure
that you relax.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.558
- Well, I mean, I never meant
for that to happen.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.760
- You have some nerve.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.228
- I know, I know.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.098
- Oh, don't get
too overworked, ray.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.799
Oh, let ray relax.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.234
He just had an episode.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.502
- Look, I never thought that--

18:24.504 --> 18:25.503
- Oh, my god!

18:25.505 --> 18:27.605
What about me, ray, huh?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.407
When do I get
to have an episode?

18:29.409 --> 18:32.410
I think I deserve
an episode, huh?

18:32.412 --> 18:34.145
When do I get
to have my little--

18:34.147 --> 18:35.546
[flutters tongue]

18:35.548 --> 18:36.747
- Wait a minute, all right?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.182
You're making fun
of an illness now.

18:38.184 --> 18:39.183
- What else was a trick?

18:39.185 --> 18:40.818
- Nothing!

18:40.820 --> 18:43.221
- Your mother coming over here
to tell me to have sex with you?

18:43.223 --> 18:45.823
- What?

18:45.825 --> 18:47.258
- Yep.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.292
This is what
I have to put up with

18:48.294 --> 18:49.527
While you're off
playing golf.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.429
Your mother coming over here
and telling me

18:51.431 --> 18:55.299
It'll help you relax if I
make myself available to you.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.901
- Oh, my god, did you just
have sex with me

18:56.903 --> 18:58.402
Because my mother told you to?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.908
Eww!

19:03.910 --> 19:05.543
Oh, how sick is that?

19:05.545 --> 19:06.911
- Very.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.679
- I'm thinking
of my mother now!

19:08.681 --> 19:09.881
- Ewww!
- Ewww!

19:09.883 --> 19:11.516
How could you
listen to her?

19:11.518 --> 19:12.817
- Because I love you, ray.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.885
I care about you.

19:13.887 --> 19:14.885
I'm not the one running off

19:14.887 --> 19:16.587
To play golf
to get away from me.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.289
- You don't think
I care about you.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.891
Why do you think
I'm confessing?

19:19.893 --> 19:21.359
Don't you see?
I feel guilty.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.793
Guilt!
Guilt!

19:22.795 --> 19:25.530
That means love.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.531
Huh?

19:26.533 --> 19:28.232
I had to come home and confess.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.800
- Yeah, but you waited
until after we had sex.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.302
- Well,
you're very good-looking!

19:34.806 --> 19:35.940
I'm sorry.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.475
Look, I'm never gonna
play golf again.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.743
- Oh, yes, you will.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.444
- I know I will.

19:43.749 --> 19:45.783
Not as much.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.619
I promise and--

19:48.621 --> 19:51.322
Only if I know it doesn't
take anything away from us.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.492
Ever.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.794
Really.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.396
I mean it.
I'm sorry.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.397
I'm sorry.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.469
- Okay.

20:05.471 --> 20:08.206
Idiot.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.708
- I know.
I know.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.410
Look, if you ever need time
to take for yourself,

20:12.412 --> 20:13.411
I want you to do it.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.411
- You know what
we should do

20:14.413 --> 20:16.914
Is find something
fun to do together.

20:16.916 --> 20:17.914
- There you go.

20:17.916 --> 20:19.483
- You know,
we should play golf together.

20:24.623 --> 20:27.825
- Yeah.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.261
That would be relaxing.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.806
You're set, right?

20:41.808 --> 20:42.807
- Yeah. Yep.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.947
- Come on, ray,

20:49.949 --> 20:50.948
We only got two hours
till tee time.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.289
- You know it's going
to rain today, don't you?

20:58.291 --> 20:59.023
- Oh, yeah?
