You got any leftovers?

Oh, yeah.

Um, just...

02:40.327 --> 02:42.794
This apple, so...

02:45.466 --> 02:47.366

02:58.579 --> 03:00.763
G'day, madison.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.948
Like the visor
my loving brother, diggie,
sent me from down under?

03:04.485 --> 03:06.351
Diggie and i broke up
when he went to australia

03:06.353 --> 03:08.420
To be
a foreign exchange student.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.122
Why could he not have taken

03:10.124 --> 03:12.524
His jerky brother,
artie, with him?

03:12.526 --> 03:15.027
It's just a dumb visor.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.062
There is nothing dumb
about an accessory

03:17.064 --> 03:19.865
That keeps the sun off
of this porcelain skin

03:19.867 --> 03:22.501
And lets the scarlet
lettuce breathe.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.536
Wait.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.471
You-- you call
your hair lettuce?

03:26.473 --> 03:27.539
If you were older,
you'd understand.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.441
I'm older.
I don't understand.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.445
And i don't understand
why you didn't get a visor.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.480
Oh, wait.
It just came to me.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.449
Diggie never loved you!
Burn!

03:39.420 --> 03:40.852
Minions.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.421
Walkabout.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.056
(didgeridoo bellowing)

03:45.759 --> 03:48.427
I'm completely over diggie!

03:48.429 --> 03:50.495
Oh, honey...

03:50.497 --> 03:54.833
Mama the therapist smells
some unresolved
diggie issues percolating.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.703
And any day my kids
are hurting and need me,

03:57.705 --> 04:00.472
Oh, that's a good day.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.975
Don't let artie upset
you about diggie.

04:02.977 --> 04:05.477
I'm not upset about diggie!

04:05.479 --> 04:07.296
Parker:
Uh...

04:07.297 --> 04:09.114
The crushed apple
in your hand says otherwise.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.822
Well, okay,
this means nothing

04:16.824 --> 04:18.724
Other than
i really hate artie.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.628
And apparently apples.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.199
Mama won't stop
until you're better.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.070
Oh, pete.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.639
Was it the meatball sub?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.442
I need a lunch shirt.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.910
Wait.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.812
What's a lunch shirt?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.547
Oh, your mother brings
fresh shirts for me

04:42.549 --> 04:44.616
In case i spill
on myself at lunch.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.585
Which he does, daily.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.621
Well, why doesn't
someone just invent
an un-stainable shirt?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.089
They did.
He stained it.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.059
Well, they didn't
invent it properly,

04:54.061 --> 04:55.861
But dr. P will.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.530
To the laboratory!

05:02.836 --> 05:05.737
Liv rooney,
you're fantastic.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.673
I can't get enough of you.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.508
(gasps)

05:09.510 --> 05:10.776
Thank you!

05:10.778 --> 05:12.944
Oh, no. I'm not
talking about you.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.513
I'm talking about
the liv rooney burger

05:14.515 --> 05:15.614
From beef mcgravy's.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.121
Hey, liv.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.625
Holden!

05:26.627 --> 05:27.693
Hi!

05:27.695 --> 05:30.095
What are you doing here?

05:30.097 --> 05:32.698
Um... Gemma, this is

05:32.700 --> 05:37.669
My neighbor-classmate-
ex-bandmate guy friend.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.739
He's also my ex-crush
that i had to keep secret

05:40.741 --> 05:43.508
From my friend, andie,
his ex-girlfriend.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.694
(laughs nervously)

05:45.695 --> 05:47.879
But that felt a little bit tmi
for a formal introduction.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.749
I heard that <i> voltage</i>
was opening up auditions

05:50.751 --> 05:53.285
To people in stevens point
and i'm auditioning

05:53.287 --> 05:54.619
For the role of garrison.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.656

okay with you.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.024
Oh, yeah.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.593

06:06.816 --> 06:09.100

that's why we're looking
in stevens point, right?

06:09.103 --> 06:12.204
For-- for talented people
just like yourself.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.106
(laughs nervously)
yeah.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.543
You're auditioning
for the role of garrison?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.579
Look at me. Closer.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.817
I have to believe
you could love her.

06:25.819 --> 06:26.852
-Liv?
-Yeah?

06:26.854 --> 06:28.286
Look at him. Closer.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.559
Look at her.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.628
Make me believe you love her.
Look at him.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.662
Make me believe you love him.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.064
Now look at me
looking at you,

06:39.066 --> 06:40.899
Still loving this burger.

06:47.174 --> 06:50.142
Hey, parker, have
you seen maddie?

06:50.144 --> 06:51.343
Yeah. Several times.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.044
We live in the same house.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.182
But right now,

06:57.183 --> 06:59.350
I'm a little busy inventing
an un-stainable lunch shirt.

06:59.353 --> 07:02.087
Is it for dad
or joey or maddie?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.889
It's for dad.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.291
But good point.
Our family eats like animals.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.592
Yeah.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.162
Whew.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.731
Sick!

07:14.067 --> 07:17.602
Oh... Oh... Oh...

07:18.639 --> 07:21.039
Um, hey, maddie?
I need your advice.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.908
Yeah, sure. What's up?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.876
What?
You don't need my advice?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.978
I'm having major boy problems.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.680
Oh. Yeah, gross.
I'm out.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.983
-So, holden is...
-(thumping)

07:37.925 --> 07:41.726
Holden is auditioning
to play my love interest
on <i> voltage.</i>

07:41.728 --> 07:43.361
(gasps) uh-oh.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.896
Okay, right?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.932
I mean, how can the guy
who can't be my boyfriend

07:46.934 --> 07:49.367
-Play my boyfriend?
-Well...

07:49.369 --> 07:52.070
Okay. I mean... Relax.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.638
'cause it's just acting, right?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.173
-It's fake.
-Is it?

07:56.310 --> 07:57.642
Is it?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.713
I mean, the finalists
audition with me,

08:01.715 --> 08:03.849
And if he turns out
to be one of them,

08:03.851 --> 08:05.851
I have to look him
in the eyes and say...

08:05.853 --> 08:07.719
"i love you."

08:07.721 --> 08:08.987
It'll be fine.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.188
And i mean, just--

08:10.190 --> 08:11.923
Just because
holden is auditioning,

08:11.924 --> 08:13.657
Doesn't mean he's gonna,
like, get the part, right?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.127
There's gotta be
hundreds of guys
auditioning for this role.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.663
Yeah.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.764
Yeah.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.933
Yeah. (scoffs)

08:21.935 --> 08:24.703
Yeah, no, you're right.
Thank you, maddie.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.771
Yeah, and i mean,
it's not like...

08:26.773 --> 08:29.674
Holden's this, like,
super cute,

08:29.676 --> 08:32.277
Talented, charismatic...
You know what?

08:32.279 --> 08:34.779
You should probably
prepare to see him
'cause he might be there.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.454
Maddie, we need to talk.

08:42.456 --> 08:45.357
Yeah, sure.
What's in the box, mom?

08:45.359 --> 08:47.459
Painful memories.

08:47.461 --> 08:50.462
I have gathered all the stuff
that you've been holding on to

08:50.464 --> 08:52.831
To keep your relationship
with diggie alive.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.767
Mom, i love you so much
for trying to help,

08:55.769 --> 08:58.803
But i really let go
of diggie a while ago.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.455
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.106
Then why are you wearing
the sweatbands
that he gave you?

09:02.109 --> 09:05.110
Um, because i went
for a run and they keep sweat

09:05.112 --> 09:06.878
From running down
my wrists.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.246
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.348
Oh, child,
you bury things deep.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.751
No, no, we are going
to make a pot of tea

09:12.753 --> 09:15.854
And talk and talk and talk.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.024
Sounds like a blast.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.260
Oh, sweetie.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.828
Come on. Open up.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.898
This was a serious
relationship, right?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.900
Am i the only one
who remembers

09:28.902 --> 09:31.436
All the talks we had about
"are diggie and i a couple?

09:31.438 --> 09:34.206
Are we not a couple?"

09:34.207 --> 09:36.975
You know, those were some
of the best times of my li--
of your life.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.178
Oh...

09:40.180 --> 09:43.348
Okay, this was not
about me missing diggie.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.951
This was about mom
missing the two of us

09:45.953 --> 09:47.919
Talking about diggie.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.754
She needed me to need her.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.756
Time to give
mom what she needs.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.793
One of us has to be
the adult in the relationship.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.362
-Oh, you are right.
-Mm-hmm.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.331
Mom, i am...

09:59.333 --> 10:00.899
Holding on to diggie.

10:00.901 --> 10:01.866
I knew it.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.902
But i know how to fix it.

10:03.904 --> 10:08.073
We are going to have a diggie
cleansing ceremony tomorrow.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.208
-I cannot wait.
-Mm-hmm.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.876
I will bring
the tea and tissues.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.878
-I will bring
the pain and sorrow.
-Yes.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.386
You're positive
this shirt is stain-proof?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.054
Guaranteed.
Let me show you.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.423
Hey, what's with
all the tarps?

10:25.425 --> 10:26.891
I'll explain in a minute.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.793
Let's just test the shirt.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.398
What are you gonna do?
Smear a little
tomato sauce on it?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.801
That would be one way to go.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.205
This would be the other!

10:45.879 --> 10:47.112
(gasps)

10:47.114 --> 10:48.880
That seemed excessive.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.386
Huh.

10:54.388 --> 10:56.087
It's not coming clean.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.289
Why is it not working?

10:58.291 --> 11:01.126
I tried inventing
an un-stainable lunch shirt,

11:01.128 --> 11:02.861
But it did not work.

11:02.863 --> 11:07.966
So instead, i built
a spaghetti sauce catapult,

11:07.968 --> 11:09.267
That worked great!

11:13.173 --> 11:15.974
So are you ready
to read with the finalists

11:15.976 --> 11:17.942
And find your love interest?

11:17.944 --> 11:20.378
Yes. I just need
one minute to do

11:20.380 --> 11:22.147
My vocal exercises
to, you know,

11:22.149 --> 11:23.848
Be all revved up
and ready to act.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.183
Ugh, i respect your process.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.518
Get crazy, girl.

11:28.422 --> 11:32.323
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.359
Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!

11:34.361 --> 11:37.328
Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!
Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!

11:37.330 --> 11:40.632
(trilling)

11:40.634 --> 11:43.401
I know it looks
a little weird,
but it works!

11:43.403 --> 11:45.170
Okay, i know it
looks a lot of weird.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.038
Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!

11:47.040 --> 11:48.306
Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!

11:48.308 --> 11:51.142
(trilling)

11:54.014 --> 11:55.380
Hi.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.950
Oh, don't stop
because of me.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.620
I was just, um, getting
those last-minute jitters out.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.355
-I'm liv.
-Josh.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.490
Auditioning for garrison.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.476
Oh!

12:07.477 --> 12:09.461
And does that thing
you were doing actually work?

12:09.463 --> 12:11.062
'cause i'm crazy nervous.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.897
Yeah, i mean,
it-- it works

12:12.899 --> 12:14.966
If you don't mind looking
really, really stupid.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.469
Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.104
-Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!
-No, no, no, no, no.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.405
See, you've gotta get the--

12:20.407 --> 12:22.574
You've gotta hit the "hawk"
a little bit harder.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.676
So, wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!

12:24.678 --> 12:27.512
Both:
Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!
Wa-ka-cha-hawk-a-cha!

12:27.514 --> 12:28.980
Both:
(trilling)

12:32.552 --> 12:34.252
Both:
Hi.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.021
Liv, you were right.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.023
There's a lot of local
talent in stevens point.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.060
Oh! You found someone
from stevens point!

12:42.062 --> 12:44.262
Great! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.965
Please don't be holden.
Please don't be holden.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.000
Please don't be holden.
Please don't be holden, please.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.602
Silence on the set!

12:53.473 --> 12:56.107
Wow, i never
thought i would be

12:56.109 --> 12:57.275
So relieved to see artie.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.444
Artie, you're auditioning!

12:59.446 --> 13:00.945
I didn't even know
that you could act.

13:00.947 --> 13:04.549
I was blessed
with all of the talents.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.286
And there's one more finalist.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.654
Oh, there is?

13:09.656 --> 13:11.422
Please don't be holden.
Please don't be holden.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.725
Please don't be holden.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.595
Hey, liv!

13:17.597 --> 13:20.165
Oh, come on!
I said "please!"

13:20.167 --> 13:22.267
Holden!
(laughs nervously)

13:22.269 --> 13:24.335
You are a finalist...

13:24.337 --> 13:27.105
And it's for
my love interest!

13:27.107 --> 13:31.009
Oh, good for you... Pal!

13:39.019 --> 13:42.020
Okay, tess and garrison
are soul mates

13:42.022 --> 13:43.655
But haven't had
the courage to admit it.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.323
Garrison, you just
followed tess

13:45.325 --> 13:48.526
Into her secret clock tower
lair with huge news.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.994
And action!

13:52.032 --> 13:54.632
-Um...
-(clears throat)

13:54.634 --> 13:56.267
Why did you follow me?

13:56.269 --> 13:59.070
'cause you need
to know the truth.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.706
I took this picture
right as you were
struck by lightning.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.041
I enhanced it...

14:03.043 --> 14:05.076
And it wasn't lightning. Look.

14:05.078 --> 14:10.181
You were struck by energy
from some kind of ufo.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.716
Your life could be in danger.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.221
Well, now you're in
just as much danger as i am.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.391
Why would you risk
everything to tell me this?

14:21.795 --> 14:23.228
You know why.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.497
I do.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.802
I love you, too...

14:33.073 --> 14:34.739
But we can never
be together.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.210
Well, it doesn't mean
i won't wait for you.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.513
As long as it takes.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.784
Yes!

14:49.356 --> 14:50.688
Fantastic!

14:50.690 --> 14:52.657
I can see the chemistry,

14:52.659 --> 14:55.293
The undying fire
that burns between you.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.395
But there are a lot
of shades to garrison,

14:57.397 --> 14:59.130
So i need you
to look at liv

14:59.132 --> 15:01.165
Like you absolutely hate her.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.237
(yelps)

15:06.239 --> 15:07.839
Whoa. Withering.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.210
I also do a good
fancy guy impression.
(clears throat)

15:12.212 --> 15:14.812
Would you like some tea
and crumpets? Yes? Hmm-hmm.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.181
Yes. Hmm-hmm.
Yes. Hmm-hmm.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.351
Okay. Artie smalls,
are you ready?

15:21.755 --> 15:23.688
The question is
are you ready?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.123
The answer is no.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.460
Prepare for this
little red rooster

15:29.462 --> 15:31.663
To rock your world!
And action!

15:31.665 --> 15:33.598
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, sorry, buddy.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.366
I say "action."

15:35.368 --> 15:37.268
Do you?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.403
Both:
And action!

15:38.405 --> 15:39.871
(soft mellow music playing)

15:39.873 --> 15:41.172
Uh...

15:41.174 --> 15:42.573
Why did you follow me?

15:42.575 --> 15:45.476
Because you need
to know the truth, girl.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.844
Minions!

15:46.846 --> 15:48.212
Picture.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.518
Oh, wow. Is that--

15:53.520 --> 15:55.453
Uh, your life is in danger
and something about a ufo.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.554
Blah, blah, blah.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.824
Sorry.
What is going on?

15:59.826 --> 16:01.826
Just go with it!
I'm intrigued.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.196
Um, okay, uh...

16:05.198 --> 16:08.166
Why would you risk
everything to tell me this?

16:08.168 --> 16:11.302
You know why,
my blond lightning bolt.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.207
I do.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.677
I love you, too.

16:21.314 --> 16:25.616
(screeching)

16:27.754 --> 16:29.220
Whoa.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.156
Are you okay, smalls?

16:32.158 --> 16:34.826
I've just heard the words
i've always wanted to hear.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.361
Never been better!

16:37.664 --> 16:39.464
Both:
And end scene!

16:43.269 --> 16:44.335
Welcome...

16:44.337 --> 16:46.504
To the diggie
cleansing ceremony.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.308
We will place each of these
emotionally charged items

16:50.310 --> 16:51.876
Into the basket...

16:51.878 --> 16:54.212
And send it
into the universe...

16:54.214 --> 16:57.181
And then we will
talk and talk and talk.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.283
And then...

16:59.285 --> 17:01.285
Could we talk
a little more after that?

17:01.287 --> 17:02.720
(laughs)

17:02.722 --> 17:04.288
Only if you need to, sweetie.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.390
Only if you need to.

17:07.494 --> 17:10.194
And finally,
the sweatbands

17:10.196 --> 17:11.896
From the day
you first met diggie.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.701
Okay, so with the removal
of the ceremonial garden forks,

17:16.703 --> 17:20.705
We will release the lantern
and everything diggie

17:20.707 --> 17:21.973
Into the sky.

17:21.975 --> 17:25.576
Go ahead...
Say it with me.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.379
Both:
I release you.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.931
I was playing along...

17:46.933 --> 17:48.933
For my mom's
benefit before, but...

17:48.935 --> 17:52.537
When i saw
the basket float away...

17:52.539 --> 17:54.672
I wasn't faking it anymore.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.610
So you ready to talk?

18:01.347 --> 18:02.713
Yeah, i am.
(sniffles)

18:05.351 --> 18:06.401
Okay.

18:06.402 --> 18:07.452
I'll make a pot of tea
and get some tissues.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.821
You meet me on the couch
and we'll snuggle in, honey,

18:09.823 --> 18:11.289
Until you feel better.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.593
That actually
sounds really nice.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.362
-Should we brush
each other's hair?
-Don't push it, mom.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.331
Okay.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.434
Okay.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.436
Moment of truth, kid.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.438
Look at me. Closer.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.644
I really like your sweater.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.348
I thought is was
a long-sleeved tee

18:37.350 --> 18:38.916
Till i got in real tight.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.420
Thank you?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.422
Liv...

18:44.424 --> 18:48.025
Are you ready to make
this one your true love?

18:48.027 --> 18:49.560
(laughs nervously)

18:49.562 --> 18:52.563
You mean pretend true love.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.899
(laughs nervously)
'cause it's just acting.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.434
Is it?

18:56.436 --> 18:57.735
Is it?

19:00.406 --> 19:03.374
Why would you risk
everything to tell me this?

19:03.376 --> 19:04.542
You know why.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.379
I do.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.983
I love you, too...

19:14.854 --> 19:17.321
But you know that
we can never be together.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.993
That doesn't mean
i won't wait for you.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.498
As long as it takes.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.968
Get away from her!

19:30.970 --> 19:32.470
She's mine!

19:32.472 --> 19:34.789
(screams)

19:34.790 --> 19:37.107
Back off, you stunning
prep school interloper!

19:37.110 --> 19:38.643
You're out, smalls!

19:38.645 --> 19:40.478
Like, out of the building!

19:40.480 --> 19:41.646
So you'll be in touch then?

19:41.648 --> 19:43.414
Have your people
call my minions!

19:50.423 --> 19:53.357
Okay, i solved the puzzle
of the lunch shirt.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.560
Do your worst.
Slob it up!

19:58.131 --> 20:00.398
After your little
catapult incident,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.500
My instinct was
to not put this on.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.935
However...

20:03.937 --> 20:06.037
This is a very smart plaid.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.862
At least your catapult
had some flair.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.865
Oh, you want flair?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.500
I got flair.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.868
Behold.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.504
(gasps)

20:43.076 --> 20:44.408
(gasps)

20:44.410 --> 20:46.477
Whoa!

20:46.479 --> 20:48.546
I call it the drip and rip!

20:48.548 --> 20:50.081
You've got eight
layers to play with,

20:50.083 --> 20:51.649
Use them wisely.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.887
I can eat in public again!

21:00.593 --> 21:02.460
You're doing great, holden.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.061
Now i need to see your range.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.497
Show me mad.
Show me angry!

21:06.499 --> 21:08.199
You despise her.

21:08.201 --> 21:10.534
Got it!

21:10.536 --> 21:11.869
Got it. Okay.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.575
Gemma:
Uh...

21:17.577 --> 21:20.478
No, not grumpy old man.

21:24.017 --> 21:26.517
Not weird pirate.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.889
Oh... Oh, no.
Not constipated either!

21:33.493 --> 21:35.026
You hate her.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.533
You know what?

21:42.535 --> 21:43.167
I can't.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.139
I can't hate this girl.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.475
Gemma:
Sorry then.

21:51.477 --> 21:55.012
We need to see
it all from garrison.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.948
Josh, you've got the job.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.884
-Congratulations!
-Yes!

21:59.886 --> 22:02.553
-I am so excited
to work with you.
-Me, too!

22:02.555 --> 22:05.056
Hey, no hard feelings, holden?

22:05.058 --> 22:06.857
No.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.092
Not at all.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.593
Gemma:
