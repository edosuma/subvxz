<i> Attention, please. Alitalia</i>
<i>announces the immediate departure</i>

00:33.120 --> 00:38.504
<i>of flight AZ611</i>
<i>nonstop New York to Rome.</i>

00:39.251 --> 00:41.920
<i>Attenzione, prego. Ultima chiamata.</i>

00:42.080 --> 00:49.634
<i>Alitalia annuncia la partenza del volo</i>
<i>AZ611 nonstop New York-Roma.</i>

05:57.293 --> 06:01.193
<i>Signore e signori, stiamo per atterrare</i>
<i>all'aeroporto Leonardo da Vinci a Roma.</i>

06:01.400 --> 06:05.473
<i>Vi preghiamo di allacciare</i>
<i>le cinture di sicurezza e di non fumare.</i>

06:05.640 --> 06:06.834
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.709
we are now approaching
Leonardo da Vinci Airport in Rome.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.429
Please fasten your cigarettes
and extinguish your seat belts.

06:14.600 --> 06:19.071
We thank you for your patronage and
sincerely hope you enjoyed your flight.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.200
Thank you.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.360
- <i>Il suo nome, per favore.</i>
- Hm?

06:39.920 --> 06:43.959
- Your name, please.
- Armbruster. Wendell Armbruster Jr.

06:44.120 --> 06:47.908
- You are from where?
- Baltimore. It says all that right on the...

06:48.080 --> 06:50.150
- Your profession?
- Executive.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.869
If you must know, I'm vice president
of Armbruster Industries.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.713
What is purpose of your visit to Italy?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.314
- To pick up a body.
- A body.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.198
A corpse.

07:01.400 --> 07:05.188
- Whose corpse? Maybe Dr Fleischmann.
- Dr Fleischmann?

07:05.360 --> 07:10.559
- The man whose passport you are using.
- Oh, uh... Wait a minute. I can explain.

07:10.720 --> 07:15.840
He and I exchanged clothes. We forgot
to exchange passports. He must be here.

07:23.400 --> 07:27.075
I was on the golf course
when I got the bad news about my father.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.151
He was killed in a car accident in Ischia.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.949
I had 30 minutes to make funeral
arrangements if I was to catch the plane.

07:33.120 --> 07:39.036
I had no time to change, and how would it
look if I showed up here in plaid pants?

07:41.680 --> 07:45.673
<i>Quest'uomo ha un passaporto falso.</i>
<i>Portatelo via.</i> This way, Dr Fleischmann.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.310
I am not Dr Fleischmann.
I'm Mr Armbruster.

07:49.480 --> 07:53.268
I am not Mr Armbruster.
I'm Dr Fleischmann.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.635
Look. I just did this guy a favour.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.268
He tells me his father is dead.
What am I gonna do?

07:58.440 --> 08:01.512
Ah! There he is.
There he is. Dr Fleischmann!

08:02.080 --> 08:04.280
That's him.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.552
- What the hell did you get me into?
- I'm sorry.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.837
This is his passport. Here.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.309
That is mine. Hm?

08:16.920 --> 08:18.990
- OK? All clear?
- Yes.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.434
- May I go?
- No.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.160
- Why not?
- Because passport must be stamped.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.955
- Well, then, stamp it.
- You have to go back to end of line.

08:27.120 --> 08:31.193
Oh... I know you foreigners. I know
how you love to push Americans around.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.960
But my father's lying
in a morgue someplace.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.038
Listen. I've got to get a train
to Naples and a boat to Ischia.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.431
If you guys give me a bad time,
if there is the slightest hitch,

08:40.600 --> 08:43.477
if I don't get him to Baltimore
for that funeral on Tuesday

08:43.640 --> 08:46.438
there's going to be such a scandal.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.755
Eulogy, first draft.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.833
We have gathered here
to bid goodbye to a good man.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.354
A rare man. A much-beloved man.

09:25.520 --> 09:29.195
Wendell Armbruster Sr
was an old-fashioned man.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.432
I mean that
in the noblest sense of the word.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.955
In these days
of defeatism and disillusionment

09:35.120 --> 09:39.272
he was one who believed in duty
to his country, devotion to his family,

09:39.440 --> 09:42.113
and dedication to his work.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.880
Not bad.

09:45.680 --> 09:51.869
He died suddenly and tragically,
far away from his loved ones,

09:52.040 --> 09:58.149
alone in a distant land where he used
to go to rest his mind and heal his body.

10:07.160 --> 10:11.073
He was a philanthropist.
A pillar of the Church.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.556
A tireless crusader of all that is decent

10:14.720 --> 10:18.156
and an ensign in the Coast Guard
during World War II. Friends...

10:18.320 --> 10:21.073
if I may borrow... Yes?

10:21.240 --> 10:24.073
I was wondering. Are you Mr Armbruster?

10:24.200 --> 10:27.078
I'm certainly not Dr Fleischmann,
so don't you start.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.789
- Why are you shouting at me?
- My name is Armbruster. What about it?

10:30.960 --> 10:36.876
I thought that's what you'd look like,
but I didn't expect you to be so rude.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.520
What the?

10:42.240 --> 10:45.835
Friends, if I may borrow
the words of a famous poet

10:46.000 --> 10:49.231
"Lives of great men all remind us..."

11:23.400 --> 11:26.437
Excuse me, but are you following me?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.511
No, Mr Armbruster. Not really.

11:28.680 --> 11:32.434
- How come you know my name?
- I know a lot of things about you.

11:32.600 --> 11:37.037
You're 42, you live in Baltimore,
you have a wife and two children,

11:37.200 --> 11:40.510
and you're a former president
of the Junior Chamber of Commerce.

11:40.680 --> 11:45.390
Oh, you read the <i>Newsweek</i> article, right?
Huh? Business and finance.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.671
Incredible, isn't it? The weather, I mean.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.115
Especially to someone
who lives in London.

11:53.280 --> 11:57.398
Last year, summer was two days in June
and three days in August.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.279
- Have you ever been to Italy before?
- No.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.956
Neither have I. As a matter of fact,
I've never been anyplace.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.999
It's a little frightening,
first time in a strange country.

12:09.160 --> 12:13.870
In Italian, everything sounds
like it's from an opera.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.476
<i>"Non c'Ã¨ sapone nel bagno."</i>
Do you know what that means?

12:17.640 --> 12:21.394
- What?
- There's no soap in the bathroom.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.438
- How about that.
- And when you're in a <i>ristorante</i> -

12:24.600 --> 12:29.276
that's a restaurant - do you know
there are 16 different kinds of pasta?

12:29.440 --> 12:35.276
"Spaghetti, spaghettini, maccheroni,
cannelloni, rigatoni, tortellini, fettuccine,

12:35.440 --> 12:38.716
manicotti, gnocchi, linguine, ravioli..."

12:39.800 --> 12:42.792
Of course, I... I can't eat any of that.

12:42.960 --> 12:47.033
I don't know if you noticed
but... I have this weight problem.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.111
I noticed that.

12:52.680 --> 12:58.437
And in the hotel, before a maid enters
your room, she asks <i>"Permesso?"</i>

12:58.600 --> 13:03.390
And if you want her to come in,
you say <i>"Avanti."</i> Forward.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.878
You should really get yourself
this little book.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.077
I know all the Italian I need to know.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.600
<i>Ciao.</i>

13:18.760 --> 13:20.478
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

14:00.760 --> 14:03.149
- Mr Armbruster Jr.
- Yes.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.600
My name is Carlucci. Carlo Carlucci.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.797
- I am the director of the hotel.
- How do you do?

14:09.960 --> 14:13.999
I sorrow for you in your bereavement.
My deepest condolences.

14:14.160 --> 14:17.311
- And my apologies.
- What are you apologising for?

14:17.480 --> 14:22.270
That it should happen in Italy,
on an Italian road, in an Italian car.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.955
- He was a bad driver.
- No. It was a bad curve.

14:26.120 --> 14:29.430
As Verdi said <i>"La forza del destino."</i>

14:30.520 --> 14:34.035
- An act of God.
- Where did they put him? Where is he?

14:34.200 --> 14:37.033
A very nice place.
The municipal morgue.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.111
- What are we waiting for?
- Your luggage.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.191
This is it.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.992
- How far is the morgue?
- It is in the other direction.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.357
- I wanna see the old boy.
- The morgue, I'm afraid she is closed.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.990
- It is the lunch hour.
- It's 2.30.

15:25.160 --> 15:29.312
- In Italy, lunch hour is from one to four.
- Three hours for lunch?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.630
Mr Armbruster...

15:31.800 --> 15:36.271
here we do not rush to drugstore
for chicken sandwich and Coca-Cola.

15:36.440 --> 15:41.958
Here we take our time. We cook our pasta.
We sprinkle our <i>parmigiano.</i>

15:42.120 --> 15:46.989
- We drink our wine. We make our love.
- What do you do in the evening?

15:47.160 --> 15:50.152
In the evening we go home to our wives.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.280
Crazy.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.870
Exactly how did the accident happen?

16:06.040 --> 16:10.591
I don't know exactly. It was a dark night
and there was that bad curve.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.228
Maybe he did not see it.
Maybe he lost control.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.551
The car plunged straight down a vineyard.
200 metres.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.029
- They must have been killed instantly.
- They?

16:19.200 --> 16:23.716
The police came, and the fire department.
It took hours to get the corpses out.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.589
Corpses? What do you mean, corpses?
How many were there?

16:28.760 --> 16:31.069
- Just two.
- Two?

16:31.240 --> 16:35.756
You see, Mr Armbruster, your father,
he was not alone in the car.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.674
- Well, who was with him?
- Nobody, really. Just an acquaintance.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.833
Another guest at the hotel. They went
for a ride. It's beautiful up there.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.358
You can see the whole Bay of Naples,
Mount Vesuvius, and Pompeii.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.193
Ah. Here we are.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.036
Sure doesn't look like a Hilton.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.589
I accept the compliment.

17:16.040 --> 17:21.990
Ah, signore, this place will never be
the same now that your father has left us.

17:22.160 --> 17:27.393
I'm Bruno, the valet. I hope you have
a pleasant stay in Ischia, considering.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.471
Thank you.

17:39.120 --> 17:43.796
I will take you to your father's suite. It is
on the main floor because of his bad back.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.635
Sometimes he would get a spasm
and we had to carry him to the mud bath.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.076
Yeah. Poor bastard. He really suffered.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.232
It is the price
you executives pay for success.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.868
Decisions, pressures, anxieties.

17:57.040 --> 18:02.353
Naturally, the batteries wear out,
the transistors break down.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.440
121-122.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.311
If you please.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.710
Nothing has been touched.

18:38.880 --> 18:43.795
He always had this suite, for ten years.
July 15 to August 15.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.557
- You must be tired. It's a long trip.
- I'm OK.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.154
Maybe you should take some mud baths.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.436
- No, I had one on the train.
- On the train?

19:15.600 --> 19:18.512
I drank it. They call it "espresso".

19:21.440 --> 19:24.955
Your father, he certainly blossomed here.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.749
On the day he would leave, he would
put his arm around me and say "Carlo..."

19:28.920 --> 19:30.956
He always called me Carlo.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.318
"What an idiot I am to go back to that
rat race. I wish I could stay here forever."

19:35.480 --> 19:38.472
When he started coming here
I thought the place was a phoney.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.074
- A phoney?
- I mean, all this nonsense about mud

19:41.200 --> 19:44.556
and underwater massages
and radioactive springs. Come on.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.712
Mr Armbruster, you may not know it,

19:47.880 --> 19:50.633
but Ischia has been a health resort
for 2,000 years.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.360
The Emperor Tiberius came here
for the gout.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.711
And the Medici. And Caruso.
And Sophia Loren.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.189
Sophia Loren has the gout?

19:59.360 --> 20:01.715
No, no, no. Here we cure everything.

20:01.880 --> 20:05.429
Take Michelangelo.
He had trouble with his kidneys.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.275
He took the waters here and passed
three stones. They're in the museum.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.278
- <i>Permesso?</i>
- <i>Avanti.</i>

20:18.640 --> 20:22.155
- Shall I unpack for you?
- Just put it anywhere.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.231
<i>Mettila sulla scrivania.</i>

20:27.960 --> 20:31.635
Operator? I'd like to make...
You're not out to lunch, are you? Good.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.237
I'd like to make an overseas call
to the United States, Baltimore, Maryland.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.833
Maryland.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.913
M. M, as in Michelangelo.
He used to stay here.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.957
You got it?

20:44.120 --> 20:46.588
Operator? Hello, operator?

20:46.760 --> 20:48.716
- You still there?
- Bruno!

20:48.880 --> 20:55.638
- Uh, the number is 426-9956, area code...
- <i>Queste valigie vanno al 126.</i>

20:55.800 --> 20:59.793
- All right, I'll give it to you slowly. 426...
- <i>Dio mio. Che cretino che sono.</i>

20:59.960 --> 21:04.078
...9956. How are we doing so far?

21:04.200 --> 21:07.033
- Good. Area code 301.
- <i>Vai, vai, vai, vai, vai.</i>

21:07.200 --> 21:11.273
I want to speak
to Mrs Wendell Armbruster Jr.

21:13.920 --> 21:17.151
Yes, it was a great loss.
That's very kind of you.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.880
Would you call me back, please?

21:26.320 --> 21:28.993
They must have liked
my father around here.

21:29.160 --> 21:33.039
Oh, yes. When the news came,
everybody was crying.

21:33.200 --> 21:37.910
The restaurant orchestra stood round his
table and played all his favourite tunes.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.196
Is that so?

21:40.360 --> 21:44.114
As soon as the morgue opens we'll claim
the body and make arrangements...

21:44.280 --> 21:47.477
No, first there are certain formalities
we must comply with.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.916
- What formalities?
- You cannot walk into a foreign country,

21:51.080 --> 21:53.913
point to a body, say "That's Father"
and walk out with him.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.119
Why not? Do they think I go around
collecting dead fathers?

21:58.280 --> 22:00.748
You will have to fill out
some official papers.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.956
Regulations about exporting a corpse.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.873
- Everything must be in triplicate.
- Crap. Fill 'em out.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.874
Certainly. And then there is some
additional crap to be dealt with.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.640
Such as?

22:11.960 --> 22:16.033
We need a certificate that he did not die
from a contagious disease.

22:16.200 --> 22:19.795
Like what? Mumps or measles?
He died from drivin' over a cliff.

22:19.960 --> 22:23.430
We need a certificate that the body
has been properly embalmed.

22:23.600 --> 22:28.196
We need a mortuary passport. This has
to be issued by the authorities in Naples.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.715
Don't bother me with details. Just do it.

22:31.360 --> 22:36.115
You are exactly like your father. You have
to pay for the road sign he knocked over.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.396
- Bad curve ahead.
- Pay it.

22:38.560 --> 22:42.155
- You must settle with the Trotta brothers.
- Who are they?

22:42.320 --> 22:46.199
They own the vineyard where the car
went down. They want damages.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.676
- Well, settle with them.
- They are asking two million lire.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.752
- Then... How much is that?
- $3,500.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.629
$3,500 for a bunch of lousy grapes?
No, let 'em sue.

22:56.800 --> 23:01.078
I agree. They're crooks.
Then there is the problem with the coffin.

23:01.240 --> 23:05.836
- What's the problem?
- For export, a special casket is required.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.515
It must be lined with zinc.
It must be absolutely airtight.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.591
- It must be...
- Well, get one.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.796
There are none in Ischia.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.191
But fortunately,
I have located one in Amalfi.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.509
Then there's no problem, is there?

23:20.680 --> 23:25.390
I want a helicopter to take me to Rome so
there won't be a delay catching the plane.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.869
- The funeral's Tuesday.
- Tuesday?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.600
In the morning. 11.
First Presbyterian Church.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.598
Impossible. You must postpone it.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.320
I... What? What do you mean, postpone it?

23:37.400 --> 23:42.554
So many things to do. This is Saturday.
Tomorrow is Sunday. Nobody works.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.756
Somebody will work.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.480
Mr Armbruster, this is a Catholic country.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.473
Then we'll get a dispensation
from the Pope.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.117
For a Presbyterian?

23:53.280 --> 23:55.999
Come hell or high water
I am out of here by Monday

23:56.160 --> 24:01.280
because at 11 o'clock Tuesday, work at
every Armbruster plant will come to a stop

24:01.400 --> 24:04.392
so the 216,000 employees
can watch the services

24:04.560 --> 24:07.028
on closed-circuit television, in colour.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.918
Puerto Rico gets black and white.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.117
There'll be governors, senators,
congressmen, judges,

24:12.280 --> 24:16.114
the AFL-CIO, the glee club
from the Coast Guard Academy.

24:16.280 --> 24:20.114
The White House is sending Dr Kissinger,
and you want me to postpone it.

24:20.280 --> 24:21.680
No way.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.960
- <i> Permesso?</i>
- <i>Avanti.</i>

24:28.480 --> 24:30.710
Excuse me,
I'm looking for signor Carlucci.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.110
- They told me...
- I am signor Carlucci.

24:33.280 --> 24:36.158
How do you do? I'm Pamela Piggott.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.719
Piggott. Uh...

24:37.880 --> 24:40.440
You are not supposed to be here.
You are in 126.

24:40.560 --> 24:44.030
I know, but I need some help.
All these questions, all in Italian.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.590
Yes, I will be glad to help you.
But not now. I will see you later.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.273
Ow! Dammit!

24:50.800 --> 24:53.678
The faucet says cold
and I burned my hands.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.640
So did I.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.988
Then I looked it up in my book.
C stands for <i>caldo.</i>

25:01.160 --> 25:04.197
But that doesn't mean cold.
It means hot. <i>Freddo</i> means cold.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.193
- It's you again.
- Hello.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.470
- You know each other.
- No, we don't.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.632
- We do. We've been travelling together.
- Look, miss.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.270
On a train there's nothing I can do,
but when you barge into my room...

25:16.440 --> 25:19.637
I assure you, Mr Armbruster,
I'm not trying to pick you up.

25:19.800 --> 25:24.954
I'm here to pick up my mother.
They tell me I can't see her till after lunch.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.839
That's right. The place opens at four.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.635
I hate going there.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.156
I'd much rather remember her
the way she was.

25:35.320 --> 25:38.710
- But I suppose it has to be done.
- Yes, yes.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.678
Wait a minute.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.199
Your mother, uh, where is she?

25:48.360 --> 25:51.477
- In the morgue.
- What's she doing in the morgue?

25:52.560 --> 25:56.189
What do people usually do
in the morgue? She's lying there,

25:56.360 --> 25:59.113
side by side with your father, I expect.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.669
Side by side with <i>my</i> father? Why?

26:02.760 --> 26:06.116
Cos that's the way they were in the car
when the accident happened.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.350
I told you he was not alone. Remember?

26:08.520 --> 26:10.829
- My father and your mother.
- Why not?

26:11.000 --> 26:15.312
You know how it is in a resort hotel.
People meet in the dining room...

26:15.480 --> 26:19.678
- Look, I'm terribly sorry. I had no idea.
- Of course you didn't.

26:19.840 --> 26:24.436
I must have seemed like some sort
of monster. Please forgive me, Miss, uh...

26:24.600 --> 26:26.192
Piggott. Pamela Piggott.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.511
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- Yes, there is.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.831
- Could I have some Kleenex?
- I will get it.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.560
Would you like some brandy?
Or to lie down?

26:35.720 --> 26:37.756
- Don't worry.
- I don't know what to say.

26:37.920 --> 26:41.833
Somehow I feel responsible because
if my father hadn't been driving...

26:42.000 --> 26:46.755
You mustn't feel that way. If it had
to happen it was more or less ideal.

26:46.920 --> 26:47.920
Hm?

26:48.320 --> 26:52.632
Warm night, full moon,
island in the Mediterranean.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.270
At the height of the season.
What more could anyone ask?

26:56.440 --> 26:58.908
Of course,
I'm completely at your disposal.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.390
- Any difficulties, any expenses involved...
- Thank you.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.199
- Wait till you hear about all the red tape.
- I heard.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.954
For instance,
you need a coffin lined with metal.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.556
- Zinc. Better get a couple of those.
- I had trouble finding one.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.314
Come on.
You can dig up a couple of coffins.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.040
You want second-hand coffins?

27:19.480 --> 27:21.391
Is that Mrs Armbruster Sr?

27:21.560 --> 27:24.950
Yes, they would have
been married 45 years this fall.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.720
How sad.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.479
That's my wife, Emily, and the two boys.

27:31.720 --> 27:36.350
That's one thing I envy you Americans for.
You're all so thin. How do you manage it?

27:36.520 --> 27:39.751
Oh. Well, swimming,
horseback riding, golf...

27:39.920 --> 27:45.119
I've tried jogging on Hampstead Heath in
a sweat suit, but never worked up a sweat.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.352
- I just worked up an appetite.
- Oh.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.400
Worked up an appetite.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.720
What's that?

27:56.920 --> 27:58.638
It's a nightgown.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.836
- What's the meaning of that?
- Of what?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.911
- That.
- Oh, that.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.791
It's a mistake.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.509
- Here's another mistake.
- I wanna know what they're doin' in here.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.240
If I'm to get that second coffin
I'd better call...

28:16.360 --> 28:19.352
- Hold it. I want an explanation.
- An explanation.

28:19.520 --> 28:22.273
- Now, let me think.
- I'll help you.

28:22.440 --> 28:27.355
The valet forgot to pack these when he
moved my mother's cases into room 126.

28:27.520 --> 28:31.149
- Right?
- You cannot get decent help these days.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.320
Time.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.598
You mean her mother
and my father were shacked up?

28:37.760 --> 28:41.309
- I don't care for your choice of words.
- They were making it. Better?

28:41.480 --> 28:46.270
Mr Armbruster. Just because two people
are sharing the same suite or the same...

28:46.440 --> 28:49.352
that does not mean
there was anything improper going on.

28:49.520 --> 28:53.832
Now you're being insulting to my mother.
She was a very beautiful woman.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.551
She was. And a lady.
And your father was a gentleman,

28:58.720 --> 29:02.076
so no matter how bad things look,
you must believe me.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.277
I have an uncle in the College
of Cardinals. Would I lie to you?

29:05.440 --> 29:07.749
You're goddamned right.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.874
- They were making it.
- Son of a bitch!

29:16.000 --> 29:20.437
Do you know how old he was? 67.
A grandfather, with a bad back, yet.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.797
- I would be proud if my father were still...
- Aw, shut up.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.554
Your mother oughtta
be ashamed of herself.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.871
- Mother had nothing to be ashamed of.
- She was the perfect lady.

29:30.040 --> 29:33.396
Meets a rich American in the lobby.
One hour later they have drinks.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.393
Two hours later
she moves into his suite and then...

29:36.560 --> 29:42.396
- Actually, they met in the souvenir shop.
- What the hell difference does it make?

29:43.400 --> 29:45.391
That was ten years ago.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.951
Ten years?

29:52.480 --> 29:55.756
- This has been going on for ten years?
- Every summer.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.832
July 15 to August 15.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.310
All the time we thought
he was getting cured he was getting laid?

30:02.480 --> 30:06.314
Mr Armbruster,
this is neither the time nor the place.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.678
Goddamn fool.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.435
- Didn't he care what people think or say?
- It was handled discreetly.

30:12.600 --> 30:16.752
- They signed as Mr and Mrs Armbruster.
- Mr and? Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.992
Yes. What?
Am I ready to talk to Baltimore?

30:20.160 --> 30:23.038
No, I'm not ready to talk to Baltimore.
Who's calling?

30:23.200 --> 30:25.998
Oh, I'm calling. Oh, uh, put her on.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.189
Hello, Emily. I'm fine.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.920
The trip was fine.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.840
Just one of those
unfortunate accidents that...

30:37.000 --> 30:41.437
For what it's worth you can tell Mother
he didn't suffer towards the end.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.070
Hm? No, I'm workin' on it.
There's no problems, just red tape.

30:45.200 --> 30:51.514
Oh, questionnaires, permits, where do you
suddenly find two zinc-lined coffins?

30:51.680 --> 30:54.274
Two? I didn't say two.
It must be the connection.

30:54.440 --> 30:57.876
What would I do with two coffins? Huh?

30:58.040 --> 31:00.838
No. I'm sorry.
No, I didn't call the embassy.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.470
They're in Rome and I'm in Ischia.
What are they gonna do for me?

31:04.640 --> 31:09.156
How's Mother? Holdin' up? Uh-huh.
And how are the kids?

31:09.320 --> 31:11.675
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

31:11.840 --> 31:15.799
Just a minute, Miss Piggott.
Where are you going?

31:15.960 --> 31:19.111
See you at the morgue.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.480
Um... Um...

31:22.200 --> 31:25.715
How are the funeral
arrangements coming?

31:25.880 --> 31:28.075
What? Who's Miss who?

31:28.240 --> 31:30.800
Piggott. Piggott, Piggott, Piggott.

31:30.960 --> 31:34.555
Miss Piggott.
Oh, she's... in the hotel.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.631
Works here.

31:36.800 --> 31:40.554
As an interpreter.
Of course you need an interpreter.

31:40.720 --> 31:44.315
Even when you go to the bathroom.
In this country, <i>caldo</i> means hot.

31:57.120 --> 32:00.635
- This is the morgue?
- Yes, sir. 17th century.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.075
The walls are that thick.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.800
The coolest place in town.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.990
<i>Cipriani. Mattarazzo dov'Ã¨?</i>

32:23.160 --> 32:26.550
<i>Non Ã¨ venuto ancora.</i>
<i>Dovrebbe essere giÃ  qui.</i>

32:26.675 --> 32:27.675
<i>Che facciamo?</i>

32:27.775 --> 32:33.112
<i>Lo so che sono giÃ  le quattro.</i>
<i>Ma bisogna aspettare.</i>

32:33.280 --> 32:37.796
Ah. Good afternoon, Miss Piggott.
It's so nice to see you again.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.994
How do you feel?

32:42.160 --> 32:46.358
That's a silly question.
You feel the way I feel. Rotten.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.954
- We will have to wait. He is not here yet.
- Who?

32:53.120 --> 32:57.830
The... <i>giudice istruttore che inquisisce</i>
<i>sulle morti violente.</i> How do you say it?

32:58.000 --> 32:59.274
- The coroner?
- That's it.

32:59.440 --> 33:03.274
- Don't tell me he's still at lunch.
- Very likely. A coroner, he eats well.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.000
He knows all the widows.

33:07.880 --> 33:11.873
- Pretty flowers. What are they?
- In Italian they're <i>tromboncini.</i>

33:12.040 --> 33:14.918
Oh, you don't say.
What are they called in English?

33:15.080 --> 33:16.798
Daffodils.

33:22.160 --> 33:26.676
Now. Miss Piggott, when it comes
to dealing with the authorities,

33:26.840 --> 33:29.479
whatever happened between
your mother and my father,

33:29.640 --> 33:31.835
we're gonna have to be careful, aren't we?

33:32.000 --> 33:35.356
Don't worry about the hotel register.
We fixed it. No more Mr and Mrs.

33:35.520 --> 33:40.196
Let me ask you, moneywise, how you're
fixed? What do you do for a living?

33:40.440 --> 33:42.635
I work in a boutique on the King's Road.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.792
Well... I'm sure you could
use a little money.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.600
Anything within reason.
I'm pretty generous.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.951
You will keep in mind what's been
happening to the stock market?

33:52.120 --> 33:57.114
Since January, Armbruster Industries
has dropped 14 and a half points.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.591
<i>Scusate, ma il traffico era pazzesco.</i>

34:22.760 --> 34:26.514
<i>Signor Mattarazzo, le presento il signor</i>
<i>Armbruster e la signorina Piggott.</i>

34:26.679 --> 34:29.752
<i>Sua madre e suo padre</i>
<i>sono quelli dell'incidente.</i>

34:29.920 --> 34:32.753
<i>Dio agisce secondo</i>
<i>i suoi voleri misteriosi.</i>

34:32.920 --> 34:34.433
<i>E noi non siamo che fili</i>

34:34.600 --> 34:38.114
<i>guidati dalla grandiosa logica</i>
<i>del suo disegno labirintico.</i>

34:38.280 --> 34:40.032
<i>Non siamo che comuni mortali.</i>

34:40.199 --> 34:42.998
- Like music.
- <i>Fragili come gusci d'uovo.</i>

34:43.159 --> 34:48.359
<i>Minuscoli come escrementi di mosca in</i>
<i>quel gigantesco vetro che chiamiamo vita.</i>

34:48.520 --> 34:51.159
<i>Scusi, sa, ma abbiamo un po' di fretta.</i>

34:51.320 --> 34:52.320
OK.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.911
<i>I moduli, prego.</i>

35:32.440 --> 35:34.351
<i>Tutto fatto. Tutto riempito.</i>

35:40.440 --> 35:43.432
<i>Giura Wendell Armbruster Jr</i>
<i>di essere Wendell Armbruster Jr,</i>

35:43.600 --> 35:46.319
<i>e che questa Ã¨ la salma di suo padre?</i>

35:46.480 --> 35:49.677
Do you swear that you are
Wendell Armbruster Jr,

35:49.840 --> 35:54.630
and this is the body of your father,
Wendell Armbruster Sr?

36:01.640 --> 36:03.358
- I do.
- <i>Lo giura.</i>

36:03.520 --> 36:09.356
OK. <i>Giura lei, Pamela Piggott che questa</i>
<i>Ã¨ la salma di sua madre, Caterina Piggott?</i>

36:09.520 --> 36:11.954
Do you swear that you are Pamela Piggott

36:12.120 --> 36:15.635
and this the body of your mother,
Catherine Piggott?

36:27.120 --> 36:30.954
Miss Piggott, it is necessary
for you to swear.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.160
I do.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.711
- <i>Lo giura.</i>
- OK.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.400
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.839
- I'm sorry. Go right ahead.
- OK.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.469
- Any luck with the coffins?
- Yes, sir.

38:31.640 --> 38:36.031
My brother-in-law in Bologna, who is
an undertaker, has two of those caskets.

38:36.200 --> 38:40.591
- He is sending them out on the first train.
- <i> Se i signori vogliono firmare.</i>

38:40.760 --> 38:43.877
- You can sign now.
- Miss Piggott.

38:52.480 --> 38:56.439
- <i>Questo Ã¨ per lei, signorina.</i>
- <i>Grazie. Lei Ã¨ molto gentile.</i>

38:56.600 --> 38:59.160
Come on, just sign, please.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.839
<i>Signorina Piggott,</i>
<i>signor Armbruster.</i>

39:34.000 --> 39:39.552
<i>Questa triste circostanza non ha</i>
<i>diminuito il piacere di conoscervi.</i>

39:39.720 --> 39:40.994
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

39:41.160 --> 39:43.720
Not if I can help it.

40:00.760 --> 40:01.954
What happens next?

40:02.120 --> 40:04.953
The red papers go to Naples
for the export licence.

40:05.120 --> 40:09.272
The whites go to Dr Galuppo to certify
there are no communicable diseases.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.750
The green papers stay here
until we get the coffins from Bologna.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.751
- Go on.
- That's all.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.593
- But we have a problem with Naples.
- Like what?

40:17.760 --> 40:20.433
They're closed on Sunday.
But fortunately,

40:20.600 --> 40:23.194
my nephew knows an official
in the licence bureau

40:23.400 --> 40:26.836
and if he can get him to open
the office right after Mass...

40:27.000 --> 40:32.279
If you ask me, Carlucci, any foreigner
who dies in Italy is out of his friggin' skull.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.908
- May I make a suggestion?
- No.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.355
- I have a super idea, I think.
- Save it.

40:37.520 --> 40:41.991
With all this nasty business, zinc coffins,
health certificates and export licences,

40:42.160 --> 40:46.278
why subject them to that?
Why don't we bury them here?

40:46.440 --> 40:48.590
Why don't we what?

40:48.760 --> 40:52.116
There's a lovely cemetery on the hill.
They could be there together.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.191
- They'd like that.
- They would.

40:54.360 --> 40:57.511
- It would solve all the headaches.
- Absolutely.

40:57.680 --> 41:02.879
The Carlucci family. We have a large plot
up there. They would be welcome.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.430
Better yet, why don't we bury them
in the Blue Grotto at high tide?

41:06.600 --> 41:08.989
- Or in Venice, like Romeo and Juliet?
- Verona.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.993
Or we could build a shrine for them,
with an eternal flame.

41:12.160 --> 41:15.038
- It was just an idea.
- They were not the Unknown Soldier.

41:15.200 --> 41:20.115
They were the unknown lovers.
Let's just keep it that way, shall we? Hm?

41:22.760 --> 41:24.671
Let's go, Carlucci.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.673
Ask fat-ass if she wants a ride.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.669
Tell him no, thank you.

42:50.480 --> 42:56.635
<i> He died suddenly</i>
<i>and tragically, far from his loved ones,</i>

42:57.480 --> 43:03.271
<i>alone in a distant land where he used</i>
<i>to go to rest his mind and heal his body.</i>

43:03.440 --> 43:06.000
- Bullshit.
- <i>He was a philanthropist.</i>

43:06.160 --> 43:07.912
<i>A pillar of the Church.</i>

43:08.080 --> 43:13.438
<i>A tireless crusader for all that is decent,</i>
<i>and an ensign in the Coast Guard during...</i>

43:13.600 --> 43:17.718
A dirty old man, that's what he was.
Eulogy, second draft.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.831
Friends, co-workers, stockholders,

43:24.000 --> 43:27.993
we come to bury Wendell Armbruster Sr,
not to praise him.

43:28.160 --> 43:30.833
The evil men do...

43:31.000 --> 43:32.911
Ignore that.

43:34.120 --> 43:37.954
Wendell Armbruster Sr
was a man for all seasons.

43:38.120 --> 43:40.710
<i>Permesso?</i>

43:40.810 --> 43:42.316
<i>Permesso.</i> I mean <i>avanti.</i>

43:45.440 --> 43:47.715
<i>- Buonasera.</i>
- <i>Buonasera.</i>

43:47.880 --> 43:51.509
The suit, I pressed it.
The shirt, it's like new.

43:51.680 --> 43:54.194
Drip and dry. Great invention.

43:54.400 --> 43:59.315
Like electric toothbrush,
roller derby, Alka-Seltzer.

43:59.480 --> 44:01.596
I love America.

44:01.760 --> 44:03.478
That's a switch.

44:03.640 --> 44:07.394
I lived in America. Wonderful people.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.994
So friendly. So kind.

44:10.160 --> 44:14.392
When I left New York,
they took me to airport in limousine.

44:14.560 --> 44:17.996
They put me on plane.
They waved goodbye.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.958
- Who's they?
- The immigration department.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.156
- You were deported?
- Yes.

44:23.320 --> 44:28.314
But first class. In America, when they
deport you, they know how to do it.

44:28.480 --> 44:32.473
Big 747. Window seat.

44:32.640 --> 44:38.556
Beautiful blonde stewardess feeding me
with a spoon all the way across.

44:39.920 --> 44:42.388
- Handcuffs.
- Who'd you work for over there?

44:42.560 --> 44:45.632
- The Mafia? Cosa Nostra?
- Only part time.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.268
You see, by profession
I am a photographer.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.556
That's very interesting.

44:52.680 --> 44:55.672
You know,
you are exactly like your father.

44:56.560 --> 45:00.030
- Not exactly.
- I mean the size.

45:00.200 --> 45:06.196
So I thought if you wanted to change,
here are all your father's clothes.

45:06.360 --> 45:10.353
This is what he wore here, huh?
Plaids, bell-bottoms, two-tone shoes.

45:10.520 --> 45:14.399
He had one conservative suit
but he's wearing it now.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.550
He was a real sport.

45:17.720 --> 45:21.030
See this watch? He left it for me last year.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.316
Spiro Agnew.

45:23.480 --> 45:26.631
And he gave me this lighter.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.313
- Zippo.
- Uh-huh.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.959
- And a camera.
- Is that so?

45:30.120 --> 45:32.190
- A Polaroid.
- Mm-hm.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.960
Never served a nicer guy.

45:35.080 --> 45:38.834
And as for the lady, she was a pussycat.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.675
A natural blonde.
Skin like vanilla ice cream.

45:43.720 --> 45:48.919
Here they are all like black olives.
Me, I prefer vanilla ice cream.

45:50.360 --> 45:53.432
- Here. Get some ice cream. Goodbye.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

45:53.600 --> 45:55.830
They were such a swell couple.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.594
Always laughter, always wine,

45:58.760 --> 46:04.710
and always the sign outside the door - <i>non</i>
<i>disturbare.</i> They never got up until four.

46:04.880 --> 46:08.190
What was there to get up for?
Nothing's open. It's lunch time.

46:08.360 --> 46:12.273
And every night, the orchestra,
it would have to work overtime,

46:12.440 --> 46:15.477
because they would dance until dawn.

46:15.640 --> 46:18.712
- And then you know what they would do?
- No, and I don't care.

46:18.880 --> 46:23.032
When the sun came up over Mount
Vesuvius, they would go swimming.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.715
- No bathing suit, no nothing.
- No nothing?

46:26.880 --> 46:28.916
Like the man says on TV,

46:29.080 --> 46:33.392
in life you only go round once,
so grab all the gusto you can.

46:33.560 --> 46:35.516
<i>Buonanotte.</i>

46:35.680 --> 46:38.478
They were swimming naked,
right outside this hotel?

46:38.640 --> 46:40.949
- Why not?
- Oh, my...

46:44.600 --> 46:47.592
Everybody asleep, nobody watching.

46:49.880 --> 46:53.998
- Except you, I imagine.
- I always get up early to shine the shoes.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.993
And that's where the Polaroid
comes in, I guess.

46:57.160 --> 47:02.393
I couldn't help it. It was so spectacular.
The sun coming up on the Bay of Naples.

47:02.560 --> 47:06.439
- I know, yes, and Vesuvius and Pompeii...
- No, no, no, Mr Armbruster.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.275
I am not a landscape man.
Only portraits and figures.

47:10.440 --> 47:13.716
- How was your focus?
- Perfect. Colour, perfect.

47:13.880 --> 47:17.668
And the water here,
it is perfectly transparent.

47:17.840 --> 47:20.798
So are you, buddy.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.520
- Maybe you want to see the pictures.
- Maybe.

47:23.640 --> 47:26.552
- Maybe I can find them.
- I bet a hundred bucks you can.

47:26.720 --> 47:31.714
It's not a question of money. I just think
any time one American can help another...

47:35.920 --> 47:38.798
Sorry to intrude.
There are important developments.

47:38.960 --> 47:42.475
- <i>Esci da qui. Fuori, fuori.</i>
- <i>Buonanotte.</i>

47:42.640 --> 47:45.712
- What is it now?
- I have good news and I have bad news.

47:45.880 --> 47:49.714
About the coffins. There is a railroad strike
so they put them on a plane.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.791
- The airport is fogged in.
- Naturally.

47:51.960 --> 47:54.633
But it will fog out.
About the health certificate.

47:54.800 --> 47:58.634
I reached Dr Galuppo on the phone,
in the operating room. He cannot come.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.756
Why? How long's it take him to operate?

48:00.920 --> 48:04.390
You do not understand.
They are operating on him. Double hernia.

48:04.560 --> 48:07.154
So now we are trying
to get the doctor from Capri.

48:07.320 --> 48:09.914
- About the export licence...
- Go ahead, pour it on.

48:10.080 --> 48:14.835
You know my nephew in Naples? Well,
he is in Firenze, but he is going to help us.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.120
So he will take the plane from Firenze to
Naples, unless the fog moves to Firenze.

48:20.280 --> 48:22.669
All right, let's have the good news.

48:22.840 --> 48:28.710
That was the good news. The bad news
is... something mysterious has happened.

48:28.880 --> 48:29.880
What?

48:30.280 --> 48:32.396
You remember the bodies
in the mortuary?

48:32.560 --> 48:35.552
- Of course I remember them.
- Well...

48:36.360 --> 48:38.920
they're not there any more.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.033
What do you mean,
they're not there any more?

48:45.400 --> 48:50.520
They are missing. Signor Cipriani says
when he locked up the bodies were gone.

48:51.120 --> 48:53.156
Gone? Gone where?

48:53.320 --> 48:56.949
That is the mystery. When he looked in
at five the bodies were there

48:57.120 --> 48:59.509
and so was Miss Piggott.

49:00.880 --> 49:03.155
Miss Piggott?

49:03.320 --> 49:08.872
<i>Lo ho visto la signorina</i>
<i>alzare la persiana e aprire le finestre.</i>

49:09.040 --> 49:10.950
<i>Ecco.</i>

49:11.050 --> 49:13.916
He saw her pull up the shade
and open the window.

49:14.840 --> 49:16.751
That kook.

49:16.920 --> 49:19.275
That sentimental idiot.

49:19.440 --> 49:24.116
Mr Armbruster, please. You don't think
she took the bodies. That's preposterous.

49:24.280 --> 49:28.398
Preposterous to you and me. But not
to her because she's off her rocker. Hello?

49:28.560 --> 49:31.199
Get me Miss Piggott's room.
I don't know the number.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.550
- 126.
- 126. Just get her.

49:33.720 --> 49:38.191
Let us be logical. How could she manage?
A little girl like that, two bodies.

49:38.360 --> 49:40.920
She's built like
a Japanese wrestler. What?

49:41.040 --> 49:45.033
Well, try the lobby, try the souvenir shop.
How should I know? Get her paged.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.555
Cipriani will have
to report this to the police.

49:47.720 --> 49:50.154
No police.
We don't want any police or reports.

49:50.320 --> 49:53.198
We're gonna handle this.
Get yourself some ice cream.

49:53.360 --> 49:57.319
- You'd better check on that family plot.
- I don't believe it.

49:57.480 --> 49:59.755
- There must be some other explanation.
- What?

49:59.920 --> 50:03.117
Who else is gonna want those bodies?
Dr Christiaan Barnard?

50:05.040 --> 50:07.429
God damn you, Miss Piggott.

50:07.600 --> 50:11.673
Hello, Emily. How are you?
It's Baltimore. Huh?

50:11.840 --> 50:16.516
I'm sorry, no, I know. I thought
you were Miss Piggott, the interpreter.

50:16.680 --> 50:19.319
A ding-a-ling.
She keeps fouling everything up.

50:19.480 --> 50:23.871
I can't fire her. I need her. Um...
No, no, no, no problems.

50:24.040 --> 50:28.033
Just a few loose ends here and there
but I'm on top of the situation.

50:28.200 --> 50:31.510
Yes, Emily, I'm positive
there'll be no postponement.

50:31.680 --> 50:35.958
The State Department? Don't bother.
I don't need any help from them.

50:36.120 --> 50:39.590
Yes. I saw him this afternoon
at the mortuary.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.512
I haven't seen him lately.

50:41.680 --> 50:45.389
How's Mother? Mm-hm.
Well, I hope she's all right for the services.

50:45.560 --> 50:48.677
We don't want any hysterics
with television and everything.

50:48.840 --> 50:53.630
Thank God it'll be a closed casket. You
heard from Billy Graham? Good. Listen.

50:53.800 --> 50:58.237
What do you think if he did the eulogy?
Because I'm emotionally involved and...

50:58.400 --> 51:01.790
Well, ask him. What's all the noise
in the background? Oh.

51:01.960 --> 51:06.431
The kids are watching the Baltimore
Orioles. What's the score? Uh-huh.

51:06.600 --> 51:11.355
Well, um... give 'em my love,
between innings, and, uh, kiss-kiss.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.273
Where the hell is that Piggott?
Carlucci? Carlucci?

51:15.440 --> 51:18.352
- Carlucci?
- I checked with the cemetery.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.750
- No bodies. Miss Piggott...
- What about her?

51:20.920 --> 51:24.390
She is in her room. She will not
answer the telephone or open the door.

51:24.560 --> 51:26.755
Oh, she won't, huh?

51:26.920 --> 51:28.720
126, huh?

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
126. Ah...

51:31.600 --> 51:33.511
Mr Armbruster, please, no violence.

51:33.680 --> 51:35.796
- This is a first-class hotel.
- Oh, sure.

51:35.960 --> 51:40.431
If she really is a kook, one wrong move,
one push, and she will fall off that rocker.

51:40.600 --> 51:44.149
- God knows what she will do.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'd better play it cool.

51:44.320 --> 51:47.232
Watch me, huh? <i>Caldo.</i> I mean <i>freddo.</i>

51:49.400 --> 51:51.311
<i>Permesso?</i> Hm?

51:53.800 --> 51:55.313
<i>Permesso?</i>

51:55.480 --> 51:57.596
Go away, Mr Armbruster.

51:57.760 --> 52:00.991
Miss Piggott,
would you please open the door?

52:01.160 --> 52:02.673
Go away.

52:02.840 --> 52:06.310
I have this problem because
there's no <i>sapone</i> in my <i>bagno.</i>

52:06.480 --> 52:09.677
There's no soap in my bathroom. Please.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.751
- No.
- No?

52:24.320 --> 52:26.197
Cool. You promised.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.752
Miss Piggott?

52:32.920 --> 52:34.831
Where are you?

52:36.840 --> 52:39.638
Aw, did I wake you up?

52:39.800 --> 52:44.191
Mr Armbruster, if you don't leave
immediately, I shall call the concierge.

52:44.360 --> 52:47.716
I've been giving a great deal
of thought to our relationship.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.838
- Operator?
- I suspect something's wrong with it.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.993
- Operator, get me the concierge.
- We got off on the wrong foot.

52:55.160 --> 52:58.391
I've been called plump.
I've been called pudgy, and chubby.

52:58.560 --> 53:01.552
But I've never been called fat-arse.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.279
- Did I say that?
- You certainly did.

53:07.440 --> 53:09.351
Shame on me.

53:10.520 --> 53:14.229
The truth of the matter is, I kind of like
girls with a little upholstery.

53:14.400 --> 53:18.791
I think most men do. I know we have
this chemical plant in New Jersey.

53:18.960 --> 53:21.997
You know what
our fastest-moving item is, huh?

53:22.160 --> 53:24.276
Silicone for injections.

53:29.040 --> 53:32.077
Take those models in <i>Vogue,</i>
like Twiggy and all the rest.

53:32.200 --> 53:36.591
Nothin' but skin and bones. A man gets
lucky and he ends up black and blue.

53:36.760 --> 53:40.958
You could even cut yourself.
Like makin' it with a pogo stick.

53:43.480 --> 53:45.710
Are you looking for something?

53:45.880 --> 53:49.919
When you first brought up this notion
in the morgue this afternoon...

53:50.080 --> 53:53.117
- What notion?
- About havin' the two buried together.

53:53.280 --> 53:56.352
I didn't think you were really serious.

53:56.520 --> 53:59.592
I'm as sentimental as the next man,
but we're grown-ups,

53:59.760 --> 54:02.069
and if you look at this realistically...

54:02.200 --> 54:03.600
Mm-huh.

54:10.320 --> 54:12.880
Oh... What I'm trying
to say is I can take a joke.

54:13.035 --> 54:14.035
- A joke?
- But...

54:14.135 --> 54:17.192
Lovers resting side by side.
Is that your idea of a joke?

54:17.360 --> 54:20.352
All right, where are they?
What did you do with them?

54:20.520 --> 54:23.512
- I don't know what you mean.
- You do. Quit horsin' around.

54:23.680 --> 54:26.797
I'm not to be shouted at,
under orders of my psychiatrist.

54:26.960 --> 54:30.635
- You got a psychiatrist. I'm not surprised.
- Because of my weight.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.837
He has me on a diet and pills
and self-hypnosis and sleep therapy.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.719
He wants me to sleep a lot
because then you can't eat.

54:36.880 --> 54:40.509
- Sometimes I sleep around the clock.
- Right now, all I wanna know is...

54:40.680 --> 54:44.389
Right now I'm going to have my dinner.
I'm going to hypnotise myself.

54:44.560 --> 54:47.597
If you want a discussion,
come back tomorrow afternoon.

54:47.760 --> 54:51.673
Tomorrow afternoon?
Don't you understand? I'm on a schedule.

54:51.840 --> 54:54.752
You're shouting again
and in my weakened condition -

54:54.920 --> 54:58.629
an apple three times a day
and a teaspoonful of honey...

55:07.120 --> 55:11.033
- Get me the dining room.
- Please call from your own phone.

55:12.680 --> 55:17.834
I'd like to make a reservation for two.
The name is Armbruster. Armbruster Jr.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.798
Oh, really? That <i>would</i> be nice.

55:20.960 --> 55:23.679
Shall we say in about 20 minutes?

55:25.200 --> 55:28.397
- Guess what table we got.
- Just turn off the light and go.

55:28.560 --> 55:31.393
Where they had dinner.
I thought that would be nice,

55:31.560 --> 55:34.870
if we had the same table,
same wine, same music.

55:35.840 --> 55:40.072
You should have heard the maitre d'.
He had tears in his voice.

55:43.520 --> 55:46.717
Miss Piggott, this is no time
to be stubborn or selfish.

55:46.880 --> 55:51.715
This has nothing to do with you or me.
It's more like a farewell gesture to them.

55:51.880 --> 55:54.440
They would like that.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.953
Shall we say in about 20 minutes?

56:20.200 --> 56:22.760
- Ah, Mr Armbruster.
- Hm?

56:23.880 --> 56:27.316
The fog in Bologna, it has moved out.
The coffins are on the way.

56:27.480 --> 56:30.836
Great. We had bodies and no coffins.
Now coffins and no bodies.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.915
I have searched the hotel with
fine-tooth comb. Even the mud baths.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.510
- Mr Armbruster Jr.
- Mm.

56:50.680 --> 56:54.309
Of course, you must be.
Same face, same suit.

56:54.480 --> 56:56.471
- Good evening.
- The table is ready.

56:56.640 --> 57:00.030
- I'm waiting for the young lady.
- Of course. Wait at the bar.

57:00.200 --> 57:02.919
Everything has been anticipated.

57:03.080 --> 57:05.958
- Mr Armbruster, here you are.
- What's that?

57:06.120 --> 57:10.591
A whiskey sour on the sour side, and
for the lady, a Bacardi on the sweet side.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.718
- That's what they used to have?
- Always.

57:13.880 --> 57:15.280
Always.

57:48.400 --> 57:51.631
That's the Baron von Schmetterling.
He's 90 years old.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.598
Been coming here since
before World War I.

57:54.760 --> 57:57.354
Remarkable.
This place must take years off your life.

57:57.520 --> 58:03.516
It certainly does. Every year, his nurses,
they keep getting younger and younger.

58:34.280 --> 58:38.114
I'm sorry to be late.
I had trouble getting into my dress.

58:38.280 --> 58:42.398
- Actually, it's my mother's.
- That's only fair. This is my father's suit.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.676
Here's your drink.

58:46.200 --> 58:48.794
- What's this?
- Bacardi for you, whiskey sour for me.

58:48.960 --> 58:51.599
- That's what they always had.
- Oh. I don't drink.

58:51.760 --> 58:54.797
Oh, look, uh, Miss Piggott, Pamela.

58:54.960 --> 58:59.750
If this evening is to be a salute to them,
then please don't louse it up. Hm?

58:59.920 --> 59:01.876
- Of course not.
- <i>Salute.</i>

59:02.040 --> 59:03.951
- <i>Salute.</i>
- <i>Salute.</i>

59:05.480 --> 59:07.630
To Mother and Father.

59:07.800 --> 59:10.109
Wherever they may be.

59:22.560 --> 59:23.788
Uh, <i>scusi.</i>

59:23.960 --> 59:26.633
I think the captain is signalling.

59:26.800 --> 59:29.360
- Table 12.
- Oh, yes, thank you.

59:35.000 --> 59:38.754
Welcome. I welcome you.
The orchestra welcomes you.

59:38.920 --> 59:42.799
- That was their favourite tune.
- Oh, how very thoughtful.

59:44.400 --> 59:48.678
<i>~ Per dirti ancor nei baci miei ~</i>

59:51.040 --> 59:54.396
<i>~ Che cosa sei per me ~</i>

59:54.560 --> 59:56.039
No, no, no, no, no. No.

59:56.200 --> 01:00:01.797
- Madam always sat on your father's left.
- Oh, of course. That was his good ear.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.831
Now then.
Shall we start with a little pasta?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.958
We have spaghetti, spaghettini,
spaghettoni, maccheroni,

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.511
cannelloni, rigatoni, tortellini, fettuccine,
tagliolini, bucatini, agnolotti, bombolotti,

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.593
cappellotti, crosetti, fiocchetti, trenette,
pappardelle, tagliatelle, vermi...

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.955
Uh, tell me. What would they have had?

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:27.719
A few gnocchi, a few ravioli,
and some green noodles, for colour.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.791
- Perfect.
- As for the wine,

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:33.714
they would always have
a Biancolella 1961 with the pasta

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.872
and a Corvo di Salaparuta with the entrÃ©e.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.838
Oh. Uh, any special entrÃ©e that they liked?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.357
Indeed. I have taken the liberty
of ordering duck Ã  I'orange for two.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.754
Super.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.639
Not for me. I brought my dinner.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.673
In that case, I'll have the duck
Ã  I'orange for two, for one.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.920
Would madam like
a little cheese with that?

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.359
No, thank you.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.398
Shall I take it out to the kitchen
and have it peeled?

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.199
- I'll manage.
- Very good.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.670
I admire your willpower.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.118
Mr Armbruster, do you know how much
I weigh? Nine and a half stone.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:29.400
That's 133 pounds.
I'm determined to lose at least two stone.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.798
Well, you came to the right place.
Michelangelo lost three stones here.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.871
- <i>Salute.</i>
- <i>Salute.</i>

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.431
Bertram and I, we used to go
to an Italian restaurant in Soho

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.194
but it was nothing like this.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.955
The waiters were all Greek
and the cook was Chinese.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.071
Who's Bertram?

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.755
My boyfriend. We've been together now
for a year and a half.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.911
What you would call "shacked up".

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.640
Would you like to see his picture?

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.872
- Sure.
- That's Bertram. The one in the middle.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.508
- He plays lead guitar.
- Is that so?

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.229
They're a terrific group.
They call themselves The Four Apostles.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.915
- Matthew, Mark, Luke and Bertram.
- And Bertram.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:22.030
He's also a terrific composer. Right now
he's writing a rock musical called <i>Splash.</i>

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.120
Splash?

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.192
Yes. It's about the sinking of the <i>Titanic.</i>

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:50.156
You know, I must admit I feel rather guilty.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.232
Why? You're not eating.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.029
- I mean about Mother and Father.
- Really? Why? What about them?

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:02.320
Well, here we are at their table enjoying
ourselves while they're lying there...

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.074
Yeah, lying where?

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.313
On the other hand,
they would have hated tears and wailing.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.472
They weren't exactly
a conventional couple, were they?

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.030
Maybe I'll just have one ravioli.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.111
Uh, certainly.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.195
You know what they would do at dawn?

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.635
- Go swimming in the bay.
- Yes, I heard.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.756
In the bay and in the nude.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.277
Then they'd lie on a rock,
basking in the sun like two baby seals.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:38.718
Baby seals! Why, that grey-haired,
self-righteous son of a... bitch.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.112
- You keep calling him that.
- Oh, look. I have nothing against sex.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.919
Premarital, extramarital,
you name it, I'm for it.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.313
I mean, just because a man's married, that
doesn't mean that he can't have a thing,

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.471
you know, with a secretary or...

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.349
Let's say you're at a convention
in Hawaii and meet some chick. OK.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.193
You swing for a couple of nights
but then, aloha.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.148
Oh, I see. You can <i>swing</i>
with ten chicks a year.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.154
That's OK. But if you love one woman
for ten years you're a son of a bitch.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.869
Love is for filing clerks,
but not for the head of a conglomerate.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.635
- 37 companies, the man had...
- Can I have a couple of green noodles?

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.711
For colour?

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.920
<i>~ Catari ~</i>

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.070
<i>~ Catari ~</i>

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:48.890
<i>~ PecchÃ© mme dici sti parole amare? ~</i>

01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:54.850
<i>~ PecchÃ© mme parli o core, ~</i>

01:04:54.950 --> 01:05:00.410
<i>~ Mme turmiente, Catari? ~</i>

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:01.911
- Caterina.
- Hm?

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.038
It's Italian for my mother's name,
Catherine.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.800
Figures.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:11.876
Your father used to call her Kate,
and she called him Willie.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.440
Willie?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.551
- And Kate. Well, what do you know?
- I'm sorry you never met her.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:24.475
- She was a bloody marvellous woman.
- I'm sure she was. Look, Miss Piggott...

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.029
I appreciate how you feel
about your mother.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.478
If you wanna bury her in Ischia, why not.
But when it comes to Willie... my father...

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:36.316
Basically, it's a question of weather. In
England, people should be buried indoors.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.948
How's the weather in Baltimore?

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.680
- Not very good, really.
- Well, there you are.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:47.198
Here you have the sun 12 months a year.
There's no need to lie in a damp grave.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.318
It gets so cold and... so lonely.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.560
<i>~ Catari ~</i>

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.930

<i>~ PecchÃ© mme dici sti parole amare? ~</i>

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:20.070
<i>Buonasera. Da voi ci sta</i>
<i>un certo signor Armbruster?</i>

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.191
<i>- Si.</i>
<i>- Posso parlargli?</i>

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.038
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Ã una cosa importante.</i>

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.111
<i>- Le ho detto di no.</i>
<i>- E io aspetto cca'.</i>

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:42.350
<i>Io sono il direttore. Che cosa</i>
<i>desidera dal signor Armbruster?</i>

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:46.752
- Do you mind if we speak English?
- Why English?

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.071
I do not want anybody to hear this.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:53.312
- It is confidential.
- Who are you?

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.192
Let us say I am from
the lost-and-found department.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.560
From where?

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:07.156
Tell me. Mr Armbruster, is he perhaps,
by any chance, missing something?

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.233
Or should I say, two somethings,
from the morgue?

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.200
Eh?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Argh!

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.431
Look, I hate to break the spell, but
before you've lost yourself completely

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:30.275
could I ask you just
for one moment to be reasonable?

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:32.670
- I'll try.
- Now, just think.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:38.515
Come Tuesday there will be 216,000
people watching that funeral in Baltimore.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.956
What will it look like if there's no corpse?

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.635
- That would look bad.
- It would be a catastrophe.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:52.470
- Hello?
- Mr Carlucci's trying to catch your eye.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.392
Well... Look, you don't know
the people in Baltimore.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:02.031
What was a beautiful romance they'll twist
into something ugly and sordid.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.716
- Oh, we can't let that happen.
- I'm glad you can see things my way.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880
Huh?

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:12.676
- But why should there be no corpse?
- No reason, if you'll just cooperate.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.673
- But what can I do?
- Oh...

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.310
Excuse me.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.876
- What? I was getting somewhere.
- You're wasting your time.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.951
- She didn't take the bodies.
- What?

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:34.113
I kept telling you. But there is a man
in the lobby. He knows where they are.

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:36.874
He assured me
they are in excellent condition.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:39.508
He asks if you are interested
in getting them back.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.078
- Who is he?
- He won't say.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.549
He won't? He won't?

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.509
- Don't annoy him. The price will rise.
- What price?

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.470
- I don't know yet but I'm sure there is one.
- Ha. All right, you creep, where are they?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.872
- It's going to be more expensive.
- If you'd care to come with me.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.156
My car is outside.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.917
This is where the accident happened.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:51.752
We were all asleep in the house
when there was this terrible noise.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.357
So we ran to bottom of vineyard,
and the car, it is smashed.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.353
And the two, they are dead.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.318
And she is holding him like this.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.075
And the radio, it's playing "Hello, Dolly".

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.318
- I think that's very touching.
- Yeah, it sure is.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.391
This way, please.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.233
<i>O vide, San Gennaro?</i>
<i>O vide, San Gennaro?</i>

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.796
<i>Tene la mmerda a' mmano.</i>

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.795
Mr Armbruster, Signor Carlucci,
this is Alberto Trotta.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.750
Arnoldo Trotta.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.229
Alfredo Trotta.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.197
Adolfo Trotta.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.154
This is Papa Trotta and Uncle Trotta.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.153
This is Grandpapa Trotta.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.710
- And I am Armando Trotta.
- That's a lotta Trottas.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.633
You bet your sweet patootie.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.352
Arnoldo and I, we used to work
with American armed forces.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.512
- Black market.
- What's your racket now?

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.638
- Body snatching?
- Mr Armbruster,

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.191
we sit down and write you nice
business letter asking for damages,

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.354
and Signor Carlucci, he calls
on telephone and tells me to screw.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.036
I did not say "screw".

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.634
I said "sue".

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:35.672
Sue? You take bodies out of country.
We take case to court.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.550
It takes many years, and in the end,
all the money, it goes to lawyers.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.077
- So you just stole them?
- Stole? That is such an ugly word.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.313
Let us say we are keeping them
temporarily in, uh, escrow?

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.995
- Where?
- They are very comfortable.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:56.197
With candles all around, and a baby-sitter.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.833
And you will get them back
as good as new for two million lire.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.070
Two... They think I'm some sucker.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.795
Two million lire for a piece of broken wall
and some crushed grapes?

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:13.149
That's nothing. But when there has been
death in vineyard, the wine turns sour.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.112
- Who says so?
- Is old Italian proverb.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.317
- I never heard of it.
- All right, all right.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.199
Let us ask some old Italians.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.957
<i>Nne, sentite, quannde per caso succede</i>
<i>cha rint' a vigna more coccoruno...</i>

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.954
Don't believe a word they say -
Neapolitans.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.350
- Let me deal with them.
- Neapolitans?

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.910
That's bush league. I bargained
with the Teamsters Union. Watch.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.991
Hey, you, big Trotta.

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.116
- <i>Si.</i>
- <i> Si.</i>

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:46.910
- There you are. They know the proverb.
- The hell with that. I'm a very busy man.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.676
I don't want any haggling or dickering.
Here's my offer, fast, firm, non-negotiable.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.910
A million lire.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:59.600
Mr Armbruster, our family, it is big.
Our vineyard, it is small.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.711
It cannot support us.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.476
Three of our brothers,
they work in Carrara, digging for marble.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.480
With all the dust in the lungs.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.429
All right, a million and a half.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.275
Two of our sisters
are prostitutes in Milano.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.512
Other prostitutes,
they use Ferraris and Alfa Romeos.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.309
But our sisters,
they have to work on bicycles.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.512
OK, two million lire,
but not one cent more.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.833
- I could not have handled it better myself.
- Thank you.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:47.353
And now, we will have some wine and
some goat cheese, and play boccie. Yes?

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.480
All right, here you are.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.677
- $3,500.
- That's two million lire. Isn't it?

01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:00.276
- We can not take this from you.
- Why not?

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.431
You are such a good man.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.319
So warm-hearted, so <i>simpatico.</i>

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.911
- We do not want this.
- What do you mean? Come on.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.311
Oh, we want it, but not in dollars.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.393
We take Swiss francs, we take
German marks, we take Japanese yens.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.997
But with your economy sick
like a dog... no dollars.

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.638
To repeat - at noon
we meet behind the morgue.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.679
You will bring German marks,
we will bring bodies.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:49.071
We will also bring fresh flowers.
No charge.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.632
<i>Buonanotte.</i>

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.997
Do you realise I've gone
40 hours without sleep?

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.276
- I'm gonna hit the sack.
- I envy you.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.238
- When do you sleep?
- In the winter.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.391
Mr Armbruster? Your crÃªpes suzettes.
I've kept them warm.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.440
Morning, Miss Piggott.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.951
I hope you're not angry with me.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:08.911
- Angry with you?
- I ordered champagne for the gentlemen.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.629
Why not? I'm sorry I suddenly
disappeared. It was a minor crisis.

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.190
- As long as you're not too late.
- I had to straighten something out.

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.638
- You know the curve where it happened?
- You don't have a shoehorn, do you?

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.631
- What?
- Oh. Never mind.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:23.800
Oh.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.756
I've been thinking about that funeral
in Baltimore. Where's it going to be?

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:32.469
- First Presbyterian Church. Why?
- Cos I want to send a wreath.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.914
- A wreath?
- Mm.

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.278
- With ribbons and something printed on.
- Like what?

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:41.318
- I thought you might have suggestions.
- No.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.675
- What, no suggestions?
- No wreath.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.469
How about a simple <i>"Ciao,</i> Willie"?
Nobody would ever guess.

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:50.677
Miss Piggott, the family
has specifically requested...

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:54.196
Why don't you just give a contribution
to your favourite charity?

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.397
- Shall I serve the crÃªpes suzettes?
- Not now.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.994
- If we don't hurry we'll miss it.
- Miss what?

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.152
The sunrise. I don't know
why I'm bothering with these.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.437
- I'll have to take them off anyway.
- What with the sunrise?

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.512
You know. Over Vesuvius
and swimming out to the rock.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.195
- You mean you and me?
- Wasn't that the whole idea?

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.318
Fat chance. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.835
It's nothing personal, you understand.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.595
- Could you help me with my zip, please?
- Certainly.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:33.509
If you give me a minute I could
find us a couple of bathing suits.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.880
Why bother?

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:39.637
I don't want you to think
that I'm stuffy or uptight.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:43.509
I'm considered a pretty groovy cat.
You know, tuned in.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:48.117
Like when I'm business in Los Angeles
I always have lunch at a topless... place.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.236
Oh, my... Uh...

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.234
Just because I don't have the long
sideburns that doesn't mean that...

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.952
Did you ever hear of <i>Oh! Calcutta!?</i> I've
seen it twice, and <i>Carnal Knowledge,</i> too.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:05.433
The permissive society, Age of Aquarius,
sexual revolution. I'm into all of that.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.275
Take the secretaries in our office,
always wearing those hot pants.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:15.117
There's nothing wrong with that, just as
long as they're worn by consenting adults.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.909
Please keep in mind that it's Sunday
and this is a Catholic country,

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.753
and they may think it's in very poor taste.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.320
Pamela!

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.397
Miss Piggott!

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:30.791
Miss Piggott! Can you hear me?

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.360
Pamela!

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.278
Miss Piggott!

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.840
Pamela!

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.759
Miss Piggott!

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.480
Can you? Oh, my God.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.116
Miss Piggott.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.636
- Are you all right?
- I'm fantastic.

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:29.918
Uh-huh. I'll give you one minute to catch
your breath, then we gotta swim back.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.958
- Ah! What's the rush?
- No rush.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.111
It's just a little cold in the water.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:39.319
It's nice and warm here just lying
in the sun with your eyes closed.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480
Yeah?

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.676
- Are your eyes closed?
- Why?

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.150
Nothing. Just... asking.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.400
Ah.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:07.275
Well, here we are,
basking like two baby seals.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.431
Wonder what they talked about,
Willie and Kate?

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.909
I'm sure they didn't talk at all.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.116
They were just listening.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.195
To the wind and the waves and
the beat, beat, beat of their foolish hearts.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.393
Why not? When you're in love
you don't need words.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.633
A look, a touch, a sigh, you've said it all.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.753
That's not bad.
I should try that on my wife.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:46.517
Every time I come home pooped
she wants to know why I don't talk to her.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.872
Do you and, uh... uh... What's?
Uh, Bertram. Do you communicate much?

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:58.955
- We haven't talked for six months.
- Beautiful. You must really dig each other.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:02.669
The fact is we haven't seen
each other for six months.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.751
The bastard walked out on me.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.799
Stole my telly, two Picasso posters
and my hair dryer.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:10.757
There's an apostle for you.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.549
He moved in with some skinny girl
in Kensington.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.837
When I found out
I tried to commit suicide.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.230
- No.
- Yes.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.836
I took my week's salary,
bought a suitcaseful of fish and chips

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.834
and a dozen bottles of Guinness stout
and tried to eat myself to death.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.118
- Took them hours to pump my stomach.
- Was it worth it, for a guy like that?

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:36.512
- It was stupid. But I've learned my lesson.
- Good.

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.240
No more fish and chips.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.072
There is something to what it says
in the tourist guide.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.151
What does it say?

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.198
It says Italy is not a country.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:55.558
- It's an emotion.
- Well, it's certainly been an experience.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.428
Uh... um...

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:07.513
Miss Piggott, I'm afraid
that we have some sightseers.

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.196
Please, Miss Piggott.
Where's your British reserve?

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.991
<i>Veni acca'.</i>

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.640
Here. Maybe you can use these.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.951
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.751
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.918
That was quite the loveliest night
of my life. Thank you.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:31.992
You're entirely welcome. See you around.

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.996
<i>Appartamento 100-108. Presto!</i>

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.355
<i>Prima che sia troppo tardi.</i>

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.717
- What's up?
- Emergency in the baron's suite.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.440
- Hope it's not a heart attack.
- Wouldn't be surprised.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.388
No, no, no. It's not the baron.
It's one of the nurses.

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.869
Good night, Willie.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.469
Good night, Kate.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.349
- Good morning, sir. Are you all right?
- What?

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.353
They told me you asked
for two bottles of aspirin.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.672
Oh, that. I just needed the cotton.
Damn bells. Talk about noise pollution.

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:38.877
There are 68 churches in Ischia.
They all want the business.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.998
- How's that nurse? All right?
- Yes, just a slipped disk.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.628
The three of them,
they were playing frog leap.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.190
- The word is leapfrog.
- I would rather not know.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.516
- I come to give a report.
- How we doin'?

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:53.638
We are making progress.
I met with the Trotta brothers.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.678
I gave them marks.
The bodies are back in the morgue.

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.751
- Good.
- The doctor examined them.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.876
- I have the certificates.
- Coffins?

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.838
They arrived this morning,
all three of them.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.434
- Three?
- The two from Bologna,

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.558
and that first one I ordered
from Amalfi. Remember?

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:14.748
- And there is no refund, no exchange.
- Big deal. Make a lamp out of it.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:18.754
About my nephew. He got to Naples.
His friend let him into the licence bureau,

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.559
even though it's closed,
and he got the licence.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.119
- Then we're all set.
- Mm...

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.637
yes and no, because this nephew,
he gets tickets for speeding all the time

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.837
and while he was in that empty building
he got to the file,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.117
he removed ten of his traffic citations
and now he's in jail.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.840
- The licence?
- They're holding it as evidence.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.431
Not to worry. When the court opens in the
morning, I have a cousin who is a lawyer.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.559
I will get to him straight away.
He is the worst lawyer in Naples.

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.996
But fortunately, he and the judge
have the same mistress.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.118
Is that what you call Italian justice?

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.392
What about Sacco and Vanzetti?

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:59.210
<i>Permesso?</i>

01:28:59.310 --> 01:29:00.591
- <i>Permesso?</i>
- <i>Avanti.</i>

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.953
When will you people learn
how to make decent coffee?

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:16.908
You know what I have for breakfast?
Hot Pepsi-Cola.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.470
- What's that?
- Your shorts washed up on the beach.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:22.835
What makes you think they're my shorts?

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.037
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe they belong to the young lady.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:29.112
Just put 'em down, will ya?

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:33.353
About those photographs I mentioned.
Your father and his friend.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.592
I have searched
and searched and searched.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.876
- And?
- I found them.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.032
Of all places,
they were inside my mattress.

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:48.197
- The complete set?
- Absolutely.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:52.359
That's the beauty of Polaroid.
No negatives, and just one print.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.636
What was it? I owe you a hundred bucks?

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.473
- No, please.
- You want Swiss francs or marks?

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:01.349
I told you. It's not a question of money.
I don't need money.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:05.911
What I need is, uh... a visa.

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.996
- A visa?
- Yes.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:11.833
I want to go back to America
and you can help me.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.673
- How?
- You know all the big shots.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:19.391
Senators, the State Department,
Dr Kissinger. You can pull strings.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.597
- No. You've been deported as a criminal.
- A criminal?

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:27.470
I am not a criminal. I am a patriot.
You know why they deported me?

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.872
There were all these hippies
demonstrating in Washington Square,

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:36.909
calling our president filthy names
and burning the American flag.

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.596
On July 4.
With police all around doing nothing.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.035
So I got pissed off!

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:47.192
And pulled my gun out of my holster.

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.590
And what do you think happened?

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:52.877
The cops arrested <i>me.</i>

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.110
It was a bum rap.

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:59.796
- Well, give me all the details and when I...
- Mr Armbruster, this can't wait.

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:03.270
You know that maid, Anna?
With the moustache?

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.193
- What about her?
- She wants me to marry her.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.555
- Congratulations.
- God forbid.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.188
If there is one thing worse
than a Sicilian woman,

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:14.397
it's a Sicilian woman who's pregnant.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.597
- I must get out of here, fast.
- Uh-huh.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:22.880
I sympathise with you, Bruno, and I'll do
all I can, but I can't make any promises.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.072
I am counting on you, Mr Armbruster.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:32.758
Because, you see,
I have other photographs.

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.638
Taken this morning.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:39.349
Same rock, same sunrise.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.988
Different bodies.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.596
So you'd better try very hard.

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.920
Hey!

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:54.837
Wait a minute. Where are those pictures?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.116
- Not in my mattress.
- You little crook.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.556
- I'll beat the bejesus out of you.
- <i>Buongiorno.</i>

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.995
- <i>Buongiorno.</i>
- What a day. Do you believe it?

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.799
What about all those bells?
Smashing, aren't they?

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:09.475
- Smashing is right.
- If you need me, just ring.

01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:15.473
- Is it all right if I go into your bathroom?
- By all means.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:21.071
Oh! Don't let me interrupt. Finish your
breakfast. Isn't the coffee here fabulous?

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.880
What ha?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.991
Did you burn yourself?

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:36.472
I weighed myself on my own scales but
I didn't believe it so I came here to check.

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.278
- I lost three pounds.
- Really?

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:41.796
After that enormous meal,
strawberries and cream this morning,

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:46.317
and bacon and eggs, and croissant
and butter. Wait till I see Dr Shaftesbury.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.836
- They should defrock him or disbar him.
- Who's Dr Shaftesbury?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.513
- My psychiatrist.
- Oh, him.

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:54.148
He said I was unhappy
because I was overweight.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.993
Rubbish. I was overweight
because I was unhappy.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.196
- See what I mean?
- Yes, I do. I think...

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.999
- How long will it take you to get ready?
- Why?

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.357
You know those carts
with the horses with the feathers?

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.310
I thought we could take a ride and stop for
an <i>aperitivo</i> or a late lunch somewhere.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.436
- I'm starved again.
- I'd like to.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.956
But there's so many things
I have to take care of here.

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.873
- It's our last day.
- Well, there's still tonight.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:21.793
Same programme?
Dinner downstairs, sunrise and...

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:25.111
Uh, no. No, no.
No, last night, that was their thing.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:28.590
I thought tonight we'd do
something different. Our thing.

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:31.069
Surprise me. <i>Ciao.</i>

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.957
<i>Buongiorno.</i> You can do my room now.

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.110
<i>Scusi?</i>

01:35:23.210 --> 01:35:25.797
<i>PuÃ² fare la mia stanza per favore?</i>

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.871
<i>Con piacere, signorina.</i>

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.840
- <i>Permesso?</i>
- <i>Avanti.</i>

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.360
Hey!

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.199
Signorina!

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.631
<i>Oi, ci sta 'a femmina nuda!</i>

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.751
<i>Signor direttore.</i>
<i>Ã successa una cosa terribile.</i>

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:24.117
<i>Bruno Ã¨ stato trovato ucciso</i>
<i>nella stanza 126.</i>

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:28.353
<i>Tre colpi di rivoltella.</i>
<i>Povero Bruno. Una cosa spaventosa.</i>

01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.431
<i>Cosa dobbiamo fare?</i>

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.360
Otto! Otto!

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.275
<i>Bisogna chiamare la polizia</i>
<i>immediatamente.</i>

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.079
<i>- Si, signore, immediatamente.</i>
<i>- No!</i>

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.074
<i>Prima di chiamare la polizia bisogna</i>
<i>fare le valigie della signorina Piggott</i>

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.714
<i>e spostarle al 121-122.</i>

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:15.075
<i>Si, si. L'appartamento</i>
<i>del signor Armbruster?</i>

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:29.832
Mr Armbruster?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.595
Ah, here you are.
You call this a first-class hotel?

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:36.593
- If it is about the bed...
- Who cares about that?

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.320
- It's about the valet, Bruno.
- You know about it?

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:42.238
I know he's a blackmailer.
I oughtta kill that fink.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.470
- It has been taken care of.
- What has?

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:47.200
- The fink is dead.
- Dead?

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.915
Murdered. He's lying in room 126
with three bullets in his chest.

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.516
- Miss Piggott's room?
- She had no part. It was the maid, Anna.

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:58.593
- She killed him and then she ran away.
- Terrible.

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:02.036
It's a tragedy. If you lose a guest
you can always replace him,

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:04.668
but to lose a valet
and a maid mid-season...

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.516
Listen. Bruno took some photographs -
perfectly innocent, mind you.

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:12.433
- But if they fell into the wrong hands...
- Don't worry.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:15.194
They fell into the right hands.

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:21.196
I'm sorry, I had to look for a second. But
I had to make sure who they belonged to.

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.429
Thanks.

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:26.513
There is just one thing that puzzled me.
The black socks.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.319
Is it because you are in mourning?

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:36.511
<i>Va bene, va bene. Portale dentro.</i>

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.954
- What's this?
- Miss Piggott's things.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.475
We are moving them in here
as a precaution.

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:51.551
- Precaution?
- The police will arrive.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:55.759
We do not want her involved. They will
start asking all kinds of questions.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:59.879
- Who knows what may come out?
- Carlucci, what would I do without you?

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:02.759
I have often wondered about that.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:35.790
- 126, <i>prego.</i>
- I'm sorry, but you have been moved.

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.440
- Moved? Why?
- I just follow orders.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:42.120
You are now in 121-122.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.913
But I was perfectly happy...

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:47.799
- 121-122?
- Mr Armbruster's suite.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.080
Oh.

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:57.872
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.840
Don't be.

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:36.170
<i> Permesso? </i>

01:45:36.270 --> 01:45:38.629
- <i>Permesso?</i>
- <i>Avanti.</i>

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.760
- It's me, Pamela.
- Oh, hi.

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:53.872
I'm in the tub. Make yourself at home.

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.669
I must say, Mr Armbruster,
you do have some cheek.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:45:59.840
I do?

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.473
Aren't you taking rather a lot for granted?

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:08.794
Just what made you think I would have
the slightest interest in this arrangement?

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:13.158
- Uh, did you say something?
- Not that I expected subtlety from you.

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.279
After all, you're American, accustomed
to having everything your own way.

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:20.512
You see something you want
and you just grab it.

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:23.990
- Uh, come again?
- London Bridge, for instance.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:29.188
You simply took it apart, stone by stone,
and shipped it off to the Wild West.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.388
Or the <i>Queen Mary,</i> with all that tradition,
sitting there off the coast of California

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.915
reduced to a floating cafeteria.

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:41.790
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Ah, such conceit. Such arrogance.

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:47.398
You act as though you own the world.
Playing golf on the moon. Now, really.

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.918
Me? I play gold at the country club.
A 12 handicap.

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:55.995
Then you wonder why people don't like
you - because you're like spoiled children.

01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:59.274
- No manners, no consideration.
- Uh...

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:05.276
You don't just pick up the phone
and say "Move that bird in here from 126."

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.318
If I'm to have an affair with someone
I'd like to know first,

01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:11.313
and not hear about it from the concierge.

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:17.513
- Oh, my God, the bags. Uh, wait a minute.
- A girl likes to be asked.

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:20.478
- She should be given a chance to say no.
- Miss Piggott...

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:25.270
- She wants to be talked into it.
- We have a failure of communication.

01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.160
Argh!

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:36.720
It's not that I'm women's lib or anything.
I don't mind being treated as a sex object.

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:40.276
But it's like any other game.
You have to play according to the rules

01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.908
or it takes all the fun out of it.

01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:46.197
Hang on a minute
before things get outta hand.

01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:58.191
Hello? Hello?

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:03.193
Baltimore?
Yes, this is Mr Armbruster's suite.

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:07.911
Could you speak up a bit, please? I'm
sorry, Wendell can't come to the phone.

01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:11.197
He's in the bathroom. Can I help you?

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.436
This is Miss Piggott.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.558
Am I the what? The interpreter?

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.033
Whatever gave you that idea?

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.760
Hello? Hello?

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.600
Ohh!

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.840
Uh, Miss Piggott?

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.871
- This...
- You're dripping.

01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:59.670
Uh, Miss Piggott, I...
Whatever you may think of Americans

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.957
I do not consider you a "bird"
or take you for granted.

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.953
- Thank you.
- About those, there was no time to ask.

01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:09.749
You were out. Under the circumstances
it seemed practical.

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:12.115
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:15.397
Look. You were moved out of your room
for your own protection.

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.630
For ours. We have to be very careful.

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:21.190
- I said surprise me, and you certainly did.
- Mm.

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:23.920
You're taller than I thought.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.834
- Pamela, what? The bed?
- Mm-hm.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.673
- You noticed it's not been made?
- I'll do it later.

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:37.355
That's because of Anna, the maid.
She was pregnant by Bruno, the valet.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:40.796
Oh, the things that go on on this floor.

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:44.430
Yeah. She wanted to get married
but he wanted to go back to America.

01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.673
There was a problem. He'd been deported.
He wanted me to help, she found out...

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:51.308
Is this going to be a long story?

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.119
Anyway, the maid...
She's Sicilian, you know.

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:58.671
She got a gun and shot him, just like that.
Three bullets through the photographs.

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.195
That's why your bags...

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.158
- <i>Permesso?</i>
- <i>Avanti.</i>

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.199
All clear. The body has been removed,
the police have left the hotel,

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:13.115
so we can now take Miss Piggott's
luggage back to her room.

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:17.398
- I'll take care of that.
- Yes. Yes, Mr Armbruster.

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:27.357
As I was trying to tell you, the murder.
She shot him in your room.

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:31.195
We had to move you out of there fast
before the police got there.

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:36.150
Then... this was not exactly
an... invitation?

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:40.199
Not really. As a matter of fact
it was Carlucci's idea.

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.554
How stupid.

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.076
No, it wasn't. The police,
once they start asking questions...

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.794
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:50.838
It's just one of those things.
It's nobody's fault.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.515
Fortunately, I'm only half unpacked.

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:57.399
Well, these things happen. That's...

01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:02.479
I remember once I was invited
to a New Year's Eve party in New York.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:05.916
Three, East 72nd St. I had a ball.

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:08.674
Next morning I found out
I was at the wrong party.

01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:12.435
It was three, West 72nd St.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:14.591
Don't you think that's funny?

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:15.760
Uh...

01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:18.834
It's...

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Yes?

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.077
Oh, uh... Put it through. Baltimore.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:27.070
They called you before.

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:32.070
Hello? Hello, Emily. How are ya?

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.200
Huh?

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:37.190
What, is somethin' wrong?
What? What was that?

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:41.439
Wait a minute. Miss Piggott?
I told you before. She's the interpreter.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.990
Who says she isn't? She did?

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:49.636
Well, I can explain that. Uh...

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:54.268
She's English. And we're in Italy.

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:58.149
She can't get a labour permit.
Naturally, she's not gonna admit...

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.993
What do you mean,
she's in my room all the time?

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:04.914
I don't mind you gettin' jealous,
but isn't this ridiculous?

01:52:05.080 --> 01:52:07.548
I mean, that you think
that I, at a time like this...

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.278
What music?

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:12.000
OK, all right, Emily. Have it your way.

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:16.153
I've got a gypsy band up here.
Incense is burning, the booze is flowing,

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:19.596
Miss Piggott and I are playing
frog leap, bare-arsed.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:22.800
Is that any better? Huh?

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:29.873
Mrs Armbruster? Just to put your mind
at rest, you needn't be worried,

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:35.160
because if you saw me, I'm short,
I'm fat, and I'm not very attractive. OK?

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:40.874
All right, Emily. You satisfied now? Hm?

01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:45.750
Let's just forget the whole incident.
Yes, I should be outta here by tomorrow.

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:50.357
Everything's all wrapped up. One small
snag in Naples - the export licence.

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:53.318
Blodgett? JoJo Blodgett?

01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:57.393
Yes, I know he's with
the State Department. A friggin' bore.

01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:01.519
He's stationed in Paris? What?
There is no reason to contact...

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.717
All right, Emily,
if the worst comes to worst.

01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:07.599
Yeah, I'll tell her. Kiss-kiss.

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:11.640
Uh...

01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:15.110
- Mrs Armbruster said to apologise to you.
- No need.

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:17.919
- I thought you overdid it.
- Just telling the truth.

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:22.631
Come on. Stop putting yourself down. I'm
sure many men find you very attractive.

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:27.999
Oh, yes. No-good bastard Bertram
and some sex-starved sardine fishermen,

01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:33.951
and the local coroner who took me for a
scooter ride and then pinched my behind.

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:40.068
Well, if it's of any interest to you,
you know who finds you attractive? Me.

01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:43.351
- I find you attractive.
- Don't bother. I'll survive.

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:47.115
This isn't the first time
I've made a fool of myself.

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.515
- Excuse me.
- Would you consider it impertinent

01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.638
if I asked you to step on the scales?

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:02.995
- Yes, I would.
- Please.

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:06.197
- Well, I really don't care any more.
- It's not the weight.

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.271
It's the height.

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.598
<i>Permesso?</i>

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:19.593
Why don't you just make
a contribution to charity?

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:21.478
<i>Permesso?</i>

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:28.240
<i>Avanti.</i>

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:03.792
- Are you guys sure this is Ischia?
- Reasonably sure, sir.

01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:06.520
Because I don't wanna land in Africa.

01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:08.631
That would be bigger, sir.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:14.397
- Maybe it's one of those Greek islands.
- No, sir. Greece is way to the left.

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:17.552
Not as long as <i>I'm</i> with
the State Department.

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.200
No!

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:50.031
No, no, no!

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.469
Go away! Go away!

01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.760
- What the hell is the name of this place?
- Ischia. But you cannot land.

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:06.874
- What do you mean, we can't land?
- It is lunch time. Come back later.

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:09.759
My good man, do you know
to whom you're talking?

01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:15.438
- I do not talk to anybody. Lunch time.
- Let me make one thing perfectly clear.

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.355
I am Joseph J Blodgett, United States
Government State Department,

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:25.310
and I am here on an emergency mission
concerning an American citizen.

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:31.191
OK, boys. Stand by. Better clear some
seats out so we have room for the coffin.

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.079
- Got you.
- All right. Oh.

01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:38.034
Tell me, how far is this hotel?

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:40.634
The Grand Hotel Excelsior,
five kilometres.

01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:42.074
OK, OK.

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.028
- What do we do about transportation?
- No transportation.

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.918
Lunch time.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.390
What the hell is going on in this country?

01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:55.949
This wouldn't have happened
in the old days.

01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:59.317
You remember... Mussolini?

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.911
Ah, Christ.

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:09.753
- What's wrong?
- I was thinking about going home.

01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:12.480
- I hate the whole idea.
- Thank you.

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.428
After the funeral there's a directors'
meeting, probably a proxy fight.

01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:21.390
I'll have to go to Washington cos they're
investigating the Armbruster Foundation.

01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:25.553
And there's that strike at
our electronics plant in Wisconsin and...

01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:29.713
We'll probably have to recall
250,000 square feet of artificial turf

01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:33.668
because they said there's too much lead
in the green paint. Argh!

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.752
Goddamn Ralph Nader. Who asked him?

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:41.068
Guess we all have our problems.

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:44.915
I have to pick up my cat
from the vet's in Bayswater.

01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:47.833
I hope the garage will have
my Mini Morris fixed now.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.719
And I really should repaint my kitchen.

01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:54.837
- Can I have your croissant?
- Of course.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.117
You can have anything you want.

01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:03.559
Miss Piggott, about your flat. Won't you
need a new television and hair dryer?

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.518
All that stuff that your apostle ran off with?

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:10.559
Don't bother. I dry my hair in the oven
and I really don't watch the telly.

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:16.636
It's always the same. Northern Ireland and
Princess Anne and the Common Market.

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.158
Pamela, uh, my father and your mother.

01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:28.792
Now, during all those years
didn't he ever give her, uh, any...

01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:34.556
Well, I mean, he must have helped her out
from time to time. Financially.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:39.513
You want to know whether
my mother was a kept woman?

01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:43.070
Well, after all, a man likes
to show his gratitude.

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:45.515
- Maybe an occasional present.
- Oh, yes.

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:50.196
Every Christmas he'd send her a dozen
long-stemmed roses to the Savoy hotel.

01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:53.432
- Oh, your mother was well-to-do.
- No!

01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:55.795
She was making Â£15 a week in tips.

01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:59.316
On Â£15 a week
she was living at the Savoy?

01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:04.315
She wasn't living there.
She was working there. As a manicurist.

01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:10.875
Did my father know that?

01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:13.918
- She didn't want him to know.
- Why not?

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:18.358
I told you the first day.
She loved him. She didn't want any tips.

01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:28.276
<i>II telefono.</i>

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:30.351
That'll be Carlucci.

01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:36.436
I have good news. The
arrangements, they have all been made.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.440
I guess it's checking-out time.

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:49.155
- Yes.
- Did Miss Piggott enjoy her kippers?

01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:53.359
No, no, no. That's not why I called.
I called to tell you that Anna, the maid,

01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:58.036
she has been arrested by the police,
in a rowboat, trying to escape to Sicily.

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:02.034
And the bodies, they are in the coffins
and all ready for shipment.

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:06.910
There was something else. Oh, yes. The
judge in Naples has had a slight stroke.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.319
Wait. What judge?
I don't know any judge in Naples.

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:15.759
Oh, yes, you do. The one with the same
mistress as my cousin, the lawyer,

02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:20.311
who was going to get my nephew out
of jail. When she helped him too hard,

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:23.199
the judge, he always had
high blood pressure.

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.834
What are you tryin' to tell me?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.753
We have no export licence? Is that it?

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.150
More or less. Now they will have
to appoint a new judge

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:36.197
and that may take a day or two.

02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:38.834
We sure are runnin' in bad luck.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.198
Look, it's not your fault. It's the way
it goes. <i>"La forza del destino",</i> huh?

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:46.670
Don't worry about it, Carlucci.
I still like you.

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.674
- Problems?
- We may be stuck here for a few days.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.956
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:56.474
- What about the funeral?
- Oh, boy.

02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:00.394
All those people,
the closed-circuit TV, the glee club...

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:04.712
I'll just have to call Baltimore. If it has
to be postponed, it has to be postponed.

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:06.438
- I'm so sorry.
- What can I do?

02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:11.151
- You've done everything you could.
- Yeah. How about you? Your plans?

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:15.753
Well, we're not that busy in the shop.

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:21.517
I'm sure Mother won't mind. She's in no
hurry to get back to the rain and the cold.

02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:25.950
I guess Dad wouldn't mind either.

02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:30.716
They deserve another couple of days
together, don't you think?

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.039
- Thank you, thank you.
- My pleasure.

02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:00.557
<i>Si, signora, I'aliscafo per Capri</i>
<i>parte alle otto e trenta.</i>

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:02.631
<i>Grazie. A sua disposizione.</i>

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:07.394
Armbruster. Wendell Armbruster Jr.
What room's he in?

02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:11.519
Just a moment. Your name, please?

02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:16.355
Here, I'll talk to him. Wendell, boy?

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.750
JoJo Blodgett, State Department.

02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:23.118
How are you, kid? Emily called me last
night, told me about your little problem.

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:26.272
Oh, dammit. I told her not to bother you.

02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:29.796
Sorry. I realise you got more
important things to do in Paris.

02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:32.758
Sure do, that's why I grabbed
the first plane to Rome.

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.831
Borrowed a helicopter from the Navy.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.356
You're in Ischia?
Uh, where? At the airport?

02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:41.432
Better than that, kiddo.
I'm right here in the lobby.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:47.516
You're in the lobby? Well, gee, that's
great. That's what I really call service.

02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:51.958
Now, JoJo, why don't you just check in
and wash up and we'll have a drink later.

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:55.795
What drink? What later?
I got to get back to Paris tonight.

02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:00.112
I'm taking Julie and David Eisenhower
to dinner at Maxim's.

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:04.114
So we gotta get crackin'. We haven't
a minute to lose. Be right with you.

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:07.829
- What's that room number?
- 121-122.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.513
121-122.

02:03:13.840 --> 02:03:17.913
<i>Entschuldigen Sie, gnÃ¤dige Frau.</i>
<i>Excusez-moi, madame.</i>

02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:20.880
<i>Idiota.</i>

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:23.040
121-122.

02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:28.320
121-122.

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:48.432
- What are we going to do with this?
- What are we gonna do with you?

02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:51.320
121-122.

02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:55.555
Mr Blodgett, I am Carlo Carlucci,
director of the hotel.

02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:58.075
- Such a pleasure to have you here.
- Thank you.

02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:03.917
We once had another famous American
diplomat staying here, Benjamin Franklin.

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:07.311
Franklin? Oh, yes, Ben Franklin.
Good man, for his time.

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:10.199
Today I'm not sure
he could pass the security check.

02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:13.233
Would you like to see his room?

02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:15.000
Not now.

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:19.557
Excuse me. I would like your advice
about something, from the horse's mouth.

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:23.030
Do you think there will be a war
in the Middle East?

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:25.589
We don't give out that kind of information.

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:30.788
You see, I have been offered a job with
a chain of American hotels, the Sheraton.

02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:34.077
There are a couple of openings
and one is in Damascus.

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.952
Damascus.

02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:41.358
Don't quote me, but with the Russian
presence escalating in the Mediterranean,

02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:46.310
the Arabs' military posture stiffening and
Israeli first-strike capability at its peak,

02:04:46.480 --> 02:04:50.359
whole place is a powder keg. It could
blow up at any second. My advice?

02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:52.909
- Forget Damascus.
- Thank you.

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:56.072
- In that case I'd better take the other job.
- What's that?

02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.959
The Sheraton in New York.

02:04:59.120 --> 02:05:01.680
Take the one in Damascus.

02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:06.353
- One more question.
- No more questions.

02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:08.431
- Wendell?
- Mr Blodgett...

02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:11.789
Come in, come in.

02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:15.360
Well, JoJo Blodgett if I ever saw him.

02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:17.391
Hi, there, Wendell.

02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:23.996
- How are ya, huh? Been a long time.
- I haven't been to the States since '67.

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:28.392
That's it. Halloween of '67. Party at
the country club. You came as Batman.

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:31.757
Yeah. I'm sorry about
what happened to your father.

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:33.831
- Well...
- Um...

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.436
Look, Wendell,
it's two o'clock in the afternoon.

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:41.593
At 11 tomorrow morning
you have a funeral 4,000 miles away

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:44.513
and you're sitting here
getting a manicure?

02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:46.796
<i>Buongiorno, signore.</i>

02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:51.351
This is Miss, uh... Tromboncino.
She works in the barbershop.

02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:54.077
Signora. Signorina?

02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:58.397
Could you possibly speed it up a little?

02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.770
<i>Scusi?</i>

02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:03.040
She doesn't speak any English.

02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:10.111
I get that all over the world. I don't object
to foreigners speaking a foreign language.

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:14.034
I just wish they'd all speak
the same foreign language.

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:19.513
- Odd.
- What's odd?

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:22.877
Wendell, if I didn't know
how strait-laced you were,

02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:25.600
and if I didn't know
that you were in mourning,

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:28.951
- and if that dame were 20lbs lighter...
- Urgh!

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:31.031
- I would suspect...
- What?

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:33.191
Mr Blodgett, please.

02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:39.037
That dame, she is my niece. She was
brought up by the Carmelite sisters.

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:46.789
- I was only kidding.
- It is forgotten.

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.513
- How many more fingers to go?
- Relax, JoJo, will you?

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:09.435
Relax, nothing. You're screwing up my
timetable. I got a helicopter standing by...

02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.318
- Can I use your can?
- What for?

02:07:11.480 --> 02:07:13.789
- To wash my hands.
- What's the helicopter for?

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:16.758
To pick up the old boy.
We're going to fly him to Rome

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:20.913
then I'm gonna put you
on the night plane to Baltimore.

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.548
- Tonight?
- Sure.

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:27.269
This is Italy. Nothing's simple.
We're still hassling over the licence.

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:30.716
- Emily told me about that.
- We can't get out before Wednesday.

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:32.996
I was about to tell 'em to postpone.

02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:37.790
Postpone, nothing. Batman is here.
We don't need an export licence.

02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:41.032
- We're going to bypass all that bull.
- Bypass? How can you?

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:45.796
No sweat. We're appointing your father
commercial attachÃ© to the embassy.

02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:49.191
That entitles him to the rights
and immunities of a diplomat.

02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.272
- Wait. You are going to appoint him...
- Why not?

02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:56.558
- A dead man?
- Just proves that we don't discriminate

02:07:56.720 --> 02:08:00.474
for reasons of race, creed,
colour or... state of health.

02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:03.837
You mean we handle him
just like a diplomatic pouch?

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:07.197
You bet. He goes right
through customs, sealed coffin,

02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:10.597
no inspection, no formalities at either end.

02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:13.149
- That's kinda cute.
- That's nothing.

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:16.676
Someday I'll tell you
how we got Batista out of Cuba.

02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:20.069
Now then. First on the agenda...

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:23.670
- First, you wanted to go to the can.
- Can. That's right.

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:24.840
Um...

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:33.399
I'm sorry, Mr Armbruster.

02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:40.038
Mother would never forgive me. Look
at the wretched job I did on your nails.

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:55.193
Carlucci. Tell me something.
Bruno's body - what did they do with it?

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:58.193
- It is in the morgue, unclaimed. No family.
- Interesting.

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:00.715
- How?
- We may have a use for that third coffin.

02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.431
- That is very generous of you.
- Your family plot - does that offer stand?

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.673
You're suggesting we bury Bruno there?
The Carluccis would turn in their graves.

02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:12.559
- I wasn't thinking of Bruno.
- No?

02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:16.638
You were thinking of somebody else?

02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:19.360
Maybe... two somebody elses?

02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:29.916
- My ancestors, they will be honoured.
- Well, we're not there yet.

02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.833
- We'll need some transportation.
- No sweat.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.753
I will call the Trotta brothers.

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:40.196
Hey. You've got a plate
of scrambled eggs in the bathtub.

02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:42.920
- I do?
- And half a herring.

02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:46.072
Now you understand
why I want that job with Sheraton.

02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:49.357
OK, kid. Here is the game plan.

02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:54.439
Get dressed and packed.
Next we collect your father.

02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:57.068
Sure thing.
As soon as they open the morgue.

02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:59.310
I'll want some officials at that airport.

02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:03.155
- I want the mayor and what have you.
- Of course. Right after lunch.

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:05.231
- That will be four o'clock.
- Four?

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:10.349
- That's when they open the mortuary.
- Oh. That goddamn lunch time again.

02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:14.069
We pour in millions of dollars
of foreign aid,

02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:17.152
just so they can sit on their butts and...

02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:19.600
Eech!

02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:25.311
What the hell is there to do
around here for two hours?

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:28.517
- Tell him about the mud baths.
- Mud baths?

02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:31.592
World famous for rheumatism, arthritis,

02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:37.278
neuritis, phlebitis, urinary complaints,
hyperacidity... male potency.

02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.749
Is that so? Well...

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.599
Come to think of it, I have a slight acid
condition. Maybe I'll give it a whirl.

02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:48.639
- By all means.
- It is downstairs. I will show you.

02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:50.711
Be right back.

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:54.837
- Say, where do we meet?
- Let me put it all together.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.911
We'll meet at the airport.

02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:58.480
Righto.

02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:03.993
That mud business. Does it really help?

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:08.950
I assure you. After one bath
you will have the acidity of a man of 20.

02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:10.120
Hmm.

02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:21.471
Thank you.

02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:25.949
It was your idea.

02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.553
- What's the name of that orchestra here?
- Sergio... something. Why?

02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:39.078
We might as well go all the way. I'm sure
he'd enjoy it more than that glee club.

02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.912
The son of a bitch.

02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:26.237
The marble. Do you want it white or pink?

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:28.320
Pink.

02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:32.878
Very good. And the inscription?

02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:36.920
I guess... "Willie and Kate".

02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.195
"Willie and Kate." That is all?

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:46.755
We don't want any weeping angels
or hearts intertwined, do we?

02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:50.629
How about "Willie and Kate... Carlucci"?

02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:53.633
I'd go for that.

02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:56.189
You make me very happy.

02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:00.516
And there will be <i>tromboncini</i>
every Sunday.

02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:04.719
After all, we are now one big family.

02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:11.114
Hold it, boys.
My father goes on the other side.

02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:13.316
Very important. It was his good ear.

02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:16.280
<i>Posalo.</i>

02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:31.280
Damn.

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.556
What the hell took you so long?

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:50.032
Signore, in Italy when a coffin passes by
people cross themselves.

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:53.749
- They kneel down sometimes in the road.
- All right, all right.

02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:56.832
Over here, boys. Let's get this thing down.

02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:10.840
Poor Bruno. If he knew
what was happening to him...

02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.080
What do you mean, poor Bruno? This is
what he wanted - to go back to America.

02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:24.074
Come on, come on, boys. Snap it up,
will you? Come on, it's getting late.

02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:27.749
Now then, will the witnesses
please step forward?

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:37.196
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:41.831
I, Wendell Armbruster Sr,
do solemnly swear

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:47.233
that I will uphold and defend
the Constitution of the United States

02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:50.472
against all enemies, foreign and domestic,

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:56.749
and that I will perform the duties
of my office to the best of my ability,

02:14:56.920 --> 02:14:59.480
so help me, God.

02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:03.351
Congratulations, sir.

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:28.551
And salute.

02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:34.640
Hup-to!

02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:41.873
Thank you, gentlemen. That concludes
the ceremonies. All right, load her up.

02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:45.191
You'll need this.
It's your father's diplomatic passport.

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:48.432
- You don't miss a trick.
- The CIA ran it off for me last night.

02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:51.672
- The CIA?
- Never heard of them. Let's go.

02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:07.672
Well, goodbye, Pamela Piggott.

02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:10.479
Have a good flight. Don't work too hard.

02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:14.758
And suppose I do? The worst that can
happen is I'll wind up with a bad back.

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:19.630
The suite. It will be ready.
July 15 to August 15.

02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:25.920
Hey, Wendell! <i>Andiamo!</i>

02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:33.317
If we should run into each other again,
in the lobby or the souvenir shop,

02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:35.914
I promise you I'll be so thin.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:42.597
Miss Piggott, you lose one pound, just
one pound, and it's all over between us.

02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:45.511
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Carlo.

02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:04.840
