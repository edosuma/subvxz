02:32.862 --> 02:37.032
'They will say
that I have shed innocent blood.

02:38.993 --> 02:42.955
'What's blood for,
if not for shedding?

02:45.040 --> 02:47.793
'With my hook for a hand,

02:47.918 --> 02:52.173
'I'll split you from your groin
to your gullet.'

03:12.943 --> 03:16.488
'I came for you.'

03:23.537 --> 03:27.291
It's the scariest story
I have ever heard, and it's totally true.

03:28.334 --> 03:31.212
It happened a few years ago,
near Moses Lake, in Indiana.

03:31.337 --> 03:34.048
Clara was babysitting
for the Johnsons,

03:34.173 --> 03:37.468
and Billy pulls up on his motorcycle.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.386
Now, she wasn't even
going out with Billy.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.181
She was actually going out with Michael
for about six months,

03:42.306 --> 03:45.684
but she always kind of
had the hots for Billy

03:45.809 --> 03:47.853
cos he was, like, a bad boy.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.773
And Michael was just so nice.

03:51.523 --> 03:55.194
So, anyway, she decides
that tonight's the night

03:55.319 --> 03:58.030
that she's gonna give Billy
what she never gave to Michael.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.199
Have you ever heard of Candyman?

04:00.324 --> 04:01.367
No.

04:02.493 --> 04:05.287
Well, his right hand is sawn off

04:05.412 --> 04:08.290
and he has a hook jammed
in the bloody stump.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.835
And if you look in the mirror,

04:11.961 --> 04:14.713
and you say his name five times,

04:15.714 --> 04:18.926
he'll appear behind you
breathing down your neck.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.136
You wanna try it?

04:24.515 --> 04:26.141
So Billy began.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.811
He looked in the mirror and he said...

04:28.936 --> 04:30.688
Candyman.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.024
Candyman.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.736
Candyman.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.448
Candyman.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.206
No one ever got past four.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.335
Not here.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.588
Go downstairs.

04:56.714 --> 04:58.090
I have a surprise for you.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.933
She looked in the mirror,

05:08.684 --> 05:10.686
and I don't know why,

05:10.811 --> 05:13.022
but she said his name the last time.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.065
Candyman.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.608
She turned out the lights...

05:21.238 --> 05:23.741
What he saw turned his hair white
from shock.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.327
Killed her,

05:26.452 --> 05:30.664
split her open with his hook,
and then killed the baby, too.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.500
And Billy got away,

05:33.625 --> 05:36.628
but soon after he went crazy.

05:37.588 --> 05:41.300
My, er... my roommate's boyfriend
knows him.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.975
So, when did you first hear this story?

05:50.100 --> 05:53.145
My friend heard it on the radio.
It's true. Sick, huh?

05:53.270 --> 05:56.357
The babysitter just roasted the kid,
like it was a turkey or something.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.860
So, what's the deal?

05:59.985 --> 06:02.821
You guys doing a page on serial killers
or something?

06:02.946 --> 06:06.784
- Something like that.
- Well, that's it. We're done.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.911
- Alright.
- Thanks.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.454
No problem.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.039
- See ya.
- See ya.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.460
See ya.

06:17.628 --> 06:20.506
Seems like they're getting younger
every day.

06:23.092 --> 06:27.388
Does anybody remember
the craze for the pet baby alligators?

06:27.513 --> 06:29.598
When they got too large to keep,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.183
people flushed them down the toilet.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.935
They live in the sewers now.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.354
Some of them are 30-feet long.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.939
Where did this happen?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.649
In Miami.

06:38.774 --> 06:41.402
They went blind and albino
from living in the dark.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.740
Sir, it wasn't Miami,
it was New York. I read it in the paper.

06:46.865 --> 06:50.160
Oh, well, then it must be true.

06:50.285 --> 06:55.499
Why would Danny and Diane both
be suffering from the same delusion,

06:55.624 --> 06:58.335
in two cities, over 1,000 miles apart?

06:59.711 --> 07:01.755
Let's face it, folks.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.092
There are no alligators in the sewers.

07:05.217 --> 07:09.930
No, it's round the campfire,
it's bedtime stories.

07:10.556 --> 07:15.394
See, these stories
are modern, oral folklore.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.357
They are the unselfconscious
reflection of the fears of urban society.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.361
That's lunch.

07:40.377 --> 07:44.590
The primordial reptile is then transformed
into this monster, right?

07:44.715 --> 07:46.508
Why?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.387
Ouch! That's bad...

07:50.512 --> 07:53.557
- Ah, the dashing professor.
- The lovely wife.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.767
Hello.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.729
Helen, you know everybody?
The crème de la crème. Harold.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.690
- Hi.
- Diane, Daniel, Stacey.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.692
- Hi.
- Hello.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.528
So, keep up the good work.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.822
- Thank you for the contributions.
- Thanks. Bye.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.991
- Awesome lecture.
- See you.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.034
Bye.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.832
See ya.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.256
So you wanna tell me about this girl?

08:26.381 --> 08:28.091
What's her name? Stacey.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.886
She could barely look me
in the eyes, Trevor,

08:31.011 --> 08:32.261
and I swear she was blushing.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.558
Well, I guess that's because
she's madly in love with me.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.477
You know, all those bursting
adolescent hormones.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.441
- You don't really think...
- No, of course not.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.444
Good. I should hope not.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.613
So, what's the matter?

08:50.656 --> 08:52.407
Trevor,

08:52.533 --> 08:56.119
you promised you wouldn't do the
urban legends lecture until next semester.

08:56.245 --> 08:59.081
You knew that Bernadette and I
were gathering data from the freshmen,

08:59.206 --> 09:01.250
so why did you have to ruin it?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.210
Honey, you're my wife
and I love you dearly,

09:03.335 --> 09:05.087
but you can't expect me
to hold up their education

09:05.212 --> 09:07.923
while the two of you complete your thesis.
I mean, be realistic.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.758
I have a curriculum I have to follow here.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.302
- Yes, I know.
- Well?

09:12.427 --> 09:14.596
So don't be mad at me.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.353
'If you look in the mirror
and say his name five times,

09:21.478 --> 09:24.815
'he'll appear behind you
breathing down your neck.'

09:35.200 --> 09:38.412
- Can I clean the room?
- Oh, sure. Don't mind me.

09:38.537 --> 09:42.124
'So Billy began.
He looked in the mirror and he said,

09:42.249 --> 09:45.919
' "Candyman, Candyman, Candyman..."'

09:48.964 --> 09:50.048
Candyman, huh?

09:51.425 --> 09:52.759
Yes, have you heard of him?

09:52.884 --> 09:54.553
Mmm-hmm.
You doing a study on him?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.765
Yes, I am.
What have you heard?

09:59.433 --> 10:02.269
Everybody's scared of him
once it get dark.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.814
He live over at Cabrini.
My friend told me about him.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.357
Cabrini-Green?

10:07.482 --> 10:08.942
Yeah, in the projects.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.278
I live on the South Side,
so I don't know too much about it,

10:11.403 --> 10:15.324
but my friend, she know all about it.
Her cousin live at Cabrini.

10:15.449 --> 10:17.909
They say he killed a lady.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.244
Can I talk to your friend?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.912
Sure.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.754
- Kitty?
- Yeah? What do you want?

10:28.879 --> 10:31.423
Lady down here wanna talk to you.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.007
Alright.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.886
She comin'.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.476
I'm Helen Lyle.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.686
Pleased to meet you.
Henrietta Mosely.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.481
- And this is Kitty Culver.
- Hello.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.733
Tell her what you told me
about the Candyman.

10:50.400 --> 10:55.280
All I know was there was some lady
in a tub, and she heard a noise.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.948
Do you remember her name?

10:57.074 --> 10:59.576
I think her name was Ruthie Jean.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.953
And she heard this banging
and smashing,

11:02.079 --> 11:04.164
like somebody was trying
to make a hole in the wall.

11:04.289 --> 11:08.960
So Ruthie called 911 and she said, "There's
somebody comin' through the walls."

11:09.086 --> 11:11.004
And they didn't believe her.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.382
- They thought the lady was crazy, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.177
So she called 911 again,
and they still didn't believe her.

11:18.095 --> 11:21.390
And when they finally got there,
she was dead.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.516
Was she shot?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.894
No. Erm...

11:26.019 --> 11:29.022
She was killed with a hook.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.649
Yeah.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.401
It's true.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.611
Yeah, it is.
I read it in the papers.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.030
Candyman killed her.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.868
Yeah, but I don't know nothing
about that.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.013
Helen, this is sick.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.807
This isn't one of your fairytales.
A woman got killed here.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.476
Jesus.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.811
That's not the half of it.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.691
Now, that's Cabrini-Green,
not that you'd recognize it today.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.694
Yeah, no kidding.
I won't even drive past there.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.739
- Heard a kid got shot there the other day.
- Every day.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.074
OK, now look carefully
at this picture.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.827
And then this one.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.961
You spot it?

13:16.254 --> 13:17.798
No.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.341
That's not Cabrini-Green.

13:20.383 --> 13:22.677
That's this building, Lincoln Village.

13:22.803 --> 13:26.515
My apartment was built
as a housing project.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.017
- No.
- Yeah.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.770
Now take a look at this.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.532
Once it was finished,
the city soon realized

13:43.657 --> 13:46.576
that there was no barrier
between here and the Gold Coast.

13:46.701 --> 13:50.261
Unlike over there, where you got the highway
and the "L" train to keep the ghetto cut off.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.707
Exactly. So they made
some minor alterations.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.002
They covered the cinder block in plaster

13:56.127 --> 13:58.129
and they sold the lot off as condos.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.090
How much did you pay for this place?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.300
Don't ask.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.180
Now wait till you see this.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.684
Here's the proof.

14:16.356 --> 14:20.735
The killer, or killers,
they don't know which,

14:20.861 --> 14:23.446
smashed their way
through the back of this cabinet.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.323
See, there's no wall there.

14:25.448 --> 14:28.785
It's only a medicine chest separating us
from the other apartment.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.206
Hey, hey, wait! What are you doing?
There could be somebody on the toilet.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.791
No, the apartment's vacant.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.669
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.921
There.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.132
OK. Now take a look.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.554
That is amazing.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.598
What?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.266
There's somebody in there.
I saw a light go on.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.602
There's nobody there.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.688
- Psych.
- That's not funny. That was not funny.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.401
- You didn't scare me at all.
- Yeah, right.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.197
Ow.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.784
You don't believe
all that nonsense anyway, do you?

15:09.910 --> 15:12.162
I don't. Do you?

15:12.287 --> 15:13.288
No.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.667
Alright.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.045
Candyman, Candyman,

15:20.170 --> 15:22.839
Candyman, Candyman,

15:26.009 --> 15:27.928
Candyman.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.139
Oh, you chicken!

15:31.264 --> 15:33.725
You have to do it five times.
Go on. Go again.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.478
- I'm sorry...
- I did it...

15:58.416 --> 15:59.834
Trevor?

16:09.260 --> 16:11.805
- Why stop? What's the matter?
- Oh, Trevor!

16:11.930 --> 16:13.890
What? Who were you expecting?

16:14.808 --> 16:16.977
What time is it?

16:17.102 --> 16:19.396
It's late, and I'm smashed.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.525
Sorry I scared you.

16:58.143 --> 17:01.062
What's with the arsenal, Bernadette?
We're only going eight blocks.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.356
You're the one
who got us dressed up like cops.

17:03.481 --> 17:07.234
- I just said dress conservatively.
- Yeah, we look like cops.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.864
- Why are you trying to scare me?
- I'm not trying to scare you, Helen.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.656
I just want you to think, OK?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.784
The gangs hold this whole neighborhood
hostage.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.955
OK, let's just turn around then!

17:20.080 --> 17:23.001
Let's just go back, and we can
write a nice little boring thesis,

17:23.126 --> 17:25.753
regurgitating all the usual crap
about urban legend.

17:31.051 --> 17:34.179
We've got a real shot here, Bernadette.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.599
An entire community starts attributing
the daily horrors of their lives

17:37.724 --> 17:39.768
to a mythical figure.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.938
Now, if Trevor and Archie were in on this,
do you think they'd chicken out?

17:44.064 --> 17:45.648
In a second.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.233
Exactly.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.986
Alright.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.943
- Yo, G, what's up?
- What's up, man?

18:34.239 --> 18:37.117
- You wanna wait here for me?
- No.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.494
Well, then let's go.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.085
- Check them out.
- And lock the car.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.424
Hey, now. Whoo!

18:53.550 --> 18:55.301
Want somethin', baby?

18:55.426 --> 18:56.636
I got it for you.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.764
Say, yo, mama.
Come over here, baby. Come on, come on.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.475
Yo, baby.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.310
Which way you goin'?

19:04.435 --> 19:06.062
Just going inside.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.523
Yeah?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.608
- Y'all can't come up in here.
- Can't come up in here.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.735
- Excuse me, y'all can't come up in here.
- Who you lookin' for?

19:12.861 --> 19:14.195
Just going up to see a friend of ours.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.573
Sure you're not the police, huh?

19:16.698 --> 19:18.825
Look like Five-O to me.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.786
Ask blondie where she goin'.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.538
Who she goin' to see?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.915
- Who you goin' to see?
- Let's take the stairs.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.125
Come on.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.252
Where you all goin' there?

19:33.506 --> 19:37.719
Heads up, people!
Five-O comin' up the back door! Police!

19:38.678 --> 19:42.140
It's OK. They think we're cops.
They're not going to follow us.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.024
Hang on.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.798
- Look at this.
- Oh, this is great.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.346
"Sweets to..."

20:22.347 --> 20:25.391
- "To the sweet."
- "Sweets to the sweet."

20:27.060 --> 20:28.102
Hurry up, Helen.

20:29.103 --> 20:31.064
Let me just get the door.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.614
Sorry.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.324
Jesus, Helen.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.246
Here it is.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.831
- Don't go in there.
- Come on.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.210
Come on, come on.

20:55.171 --> 20:57.131
Jesus, it stinks.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.601
See, I was right.
The layout is identical.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.646
Which means
that the bathroom is over there.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.815
- Helen...
- What's the problem?

21:13.940 --> 21:16.359
A woman died in there.
Leave it.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.287
It's alright.
There's nothing to see.

21:33.459 --> 21:34.961
God.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.798
Wait a minute.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.718
- This is where he crawled through, right?
- Yeah.

21:48.725 --> 21:51.436
- Well, we found it. Let's go.
- Wait a second.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.234
OK. Hang on to this.

22:00.528 --> 22:01.779
What?

22:01.904 --> 22:03.948
I'm just gonna go through,

22:04.073 --> 22:06.659
- and when I get back, we're out of here.
- You gotta be kidding.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.745
Oh, come on.
It's just a derelict apartment.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.621
What if somebody's
packing drugs in there?

22:10.747 --> 22:13.916
You're just gonna apologize
and give them your card?

22:14.042 --> 22:15.501
Huh?

22:15.626 --> 22:17.086
Alright. Let's listen.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.178
There's nobody in there.

22:26.095 --> 22:27.347
OK.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.557
But hurry up. Be careful.

22:40.234 --> 22:43.154
- Give me the camera.
- You got five minutes.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.198
OK. Five.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.260
Dammit!

24:48.988 --> 24:50.198
Bernadette!

24:50.323 --> 24:51.323
I'm sorry.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.202
- I ran out of film. I've gotta go back.
- No way.

24:54.327 --> 24:57.330
- You can't believe what...
- No way, Helen. We're out of here.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.217
Hey, what y'all doin' in there?

25:10.176 --> 25:11.761
We're just leaving.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.472
- You here for the sweet?
- No.

25:15.056 --> 25:17.141
Er, we're not cops.

25:17.266 --> 25:20.311
- We're from the university.
- Well, you don't belong here, lady.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.460
You don't belong goin'
through people's apartments and things.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.359
My name is Helen Lyle
and this is Bernadette Walsh.

25:26.484 --> 25:27.568
We're doing a thesis,

25:27.693 --> 25:30.863
and we were wondering if we could just
talk to you for a few minutes.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.741
Here. This is my card.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.748
My baby. Come on.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.833
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.

25:47.463 --> 25:51.092
You know, whites don't ever come here,
except to cause us a problem.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.594
Believe me,
that's not what we want to do.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.561
Let's go.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.989
So you say you're doing a study?

26:14.031 --> 26:15.408
What you gonna say?

26:15.533 --> 26:17.577
That we're bad?

26:17.702 --> 26:18.744
Hmm?

26:18.869 --> 26:20.580
We steal?

26:20.705 --> 26:22.039
We gangbang?

26:22.957 --> 26:24.834
We all on drugs, right?

26:26.502 --> 26:29.046
We ain't all like them assholes
downstairs, you know?

26:30.214 --> 26:32.508
I just wanna raise my child good.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.052
He's a beautiful little boy.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.680
He's all I got.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.432
What's his name?

26:40.224 --> 26:41.684
Anthony.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.730
I'm Anne-Marie.

26:48.608 --> 26:51.444
- Anne-Marie McCoy.
- Nice to meet you.

26:51.569 --> 26:53.321
I'm sorry we disturbed you.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.114
We'll just get out of your way.

26:55.239 --> 26:56.949
It's OK. I mean...

26:57.074 --> 26:59.035
I don't mean to be rude. It's...

26:59.160 --> 27:02.038
You know, it's just...
The white folks that come round here

27:02.163 --> 27:04.624
ain't too handshakin' with us,
you know?

27:06.917 --> 27:08.919
- Hey, what you doin'?
- Let me help you.

27:09.587 --> 27:10.963
Oh.

27:11.756 --> 27:13.799
Making a mess here, huh?

27:14.842 --> 27:16.218
Thank you.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.137
Thanks.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.430
You got kids?

27:19.555 --> 27:21.682
No, but I'd love one.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.351
Hey.

27:23.476 --> 27:26.145
Got my eye on this one, big time.

27:26.270 --> 27:29.231
Yeah. They're not gonna get him.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.535
You wanna know
about Ruthie Jean?

27:43.287 --> 27:44.914
They all been here, you know?

27:45.539 --> 27:49.669
Newspapers, cops, case workers.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.962
They all wanna know.

27:54.090 --> 27:56.008
I heard her screaming.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.179
I heard her right through the walls.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.433
I dialed 911.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.102
Nobody came.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.145
Nobody came.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.731
Everybody's scared.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.527
He can come right through these walls,
you know?

28:15.444 --> 28:16.987
I'm scared.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.866
Scared for my child.

28:23.411 --> 28:25.121
They ain't never gonna catch him.

28:25.871 --> 28:26.871
Who?

28:28.416 --> 28:29.792
Candyman.

28:35.881 --> 28:39.260
If they asked for something, if they saw
something they liked, they didn't point.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.721
They thought it was rude to point.

28:43.139 --> 28:45.850
What did they do?

28:45.975 --> 28:48.686
Spat over people.
It's quite extraordinary.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.107
- Be nice.
- I am being nice. I'm being very nice.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.072
So how are the two most beautiful
graduate students getting along, then?

28:57.486 --> 29:00.906
Trevor tells me you've been dabbling
in my favorite subject.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.745
Well, I can't wait to review your data.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.748
- I think I can fit you in tomorrow morning.
- We're not ready yet.

29:10.458 --> 29:14.628
That's precisely the moment
at which I can be of greatest assistance.

29:14.754 --> 29:18.716
Before you disappear down a path
to academic Bolivia.

29:18.841 --> 29:21.051
I think I've been there.

29:22.136 --> 29:25.264
Actually, Purcell,
we're about to bury you.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.807
- Helen...
- What?

29:29.226 --> 29:31.645
I'm sure we're gonna have something
for you in a week or so.

29:31.771 --> 29:34.690
- It's just that we only went to Cabrini today...
- Ah!

29:35.649 --> 29:37.693
Cabrini-Green.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.653
Candyman country.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.948
Well, if you're after the hook man, Helen,

29:43.073 --> 29:46.535
you really must read the paper
I wrote about him ten years ago.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.246
You do know the story, don't you?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.080
No.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.592
Then how are you going to bury me?

30:05.763 --> 30:08.933
The legend first appeared in 1890.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.895
Candyman was the son of a slave.

30:14.355 --> 30:16.899
His father had amassed
a considerable fortune

30:17.024 --> 30:20.528
from designing a device
for the mass-producing of shoes

30:20.653 --> 30:22.530
after the Civil War.

30:24.073 --> 30:26.534
Candyman had been sent
to all the best schools,

30:26.659 --> 30:28.953
and had grown up in polite society.

30:31.205 --> 30:34.667
He had a prodigious talent as an artist

30:35.709 --> 30:39.755
and was much sought after
when it came to the documenting

30:39.880 --> 30:43.717
of one's wealth and position in society,
in a portrait.

30:45.511 --> 30:49.056
It was in this latter capacity

30:49.181 --> 30:51.183
that he was commissioned
by a wealthy landowner

30:51.308 --> 30:54.061
to capture his daughter's
virginal beauty.

30:56.939 --> 30:59.316
Well, of course,
they fell deeply in love,

30:59.441 --> 31:02.152
and she became pregnant.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.533
Poor Candyman.

31:11.453 --> 31:14.456
The father executed a terrible revenge.

31:16.166 --> 31:19.461
He paid a pack of brutal hooligans
to do the deed.

31:21.088 --> 31:25.426
They chased Candyman
through the town to Cabrini-Green,

31:25.551 --> 31:30.180
where they proceeded to saw off
his right hand with a rusty blade.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.810
And no one came to his aid.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.481
But this was just the beginning
of his ordeal.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.942
Nearby, there was an apiary.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.613
Dozens of hives filled with hungry bees.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.994
They smashed the hives
and stole the honeycomb,

31:52.119 --> 31:55.456
and smeared it over his prone,
naked body.

31:58.334 --> 32:01.587
Candyman was stung to death
by the bees.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.592
They burned his body on a giant pyre

32:06.717 --> 32:10.137
and then scattered his ashes
over Cabrini-Green.

32:24.485 --> 32:25.903
Hello.

32:29.490 --> 32:30.950
Anne-Marie ain't in.

32:32.785 --> 32:33.869
Are you sure?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.997
Yeah. She said you'd be back.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.674
What's your name?

32:47.549 --> 32:49.134
Jake.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.889
Well, listen, Jake,
maybe you can help me out.

32:54.014 --> 32:57.434
I wanted to find out
about that woman who got killed.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.228
Do you know anything about that?

33:00.229 --> 33:02.731
Her name was Ruthie Jean.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.191
I don't know nothing.

33:05.401 --> 33:07.069
Did anybody else talk about it?

33:10.739 --> 33:13.909
You know,
it's OK to talk to me, Jake...

33:17.788 --> 33:19.707
cos I'm not a cop.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.376
So nobody's gonna get in trouble.

33:22.501 --> 33:26.880
I can't say nothing,
or Candyman'll get me.

33:28.257 --> 33:29.842
Candyman, huh?

33:31.677 --> 33:33.762
You scared of him?

33:33.887 --> 33:36.140
I ain't scared of nobody.

33:36.265 --> 33:39.143
But you're crazy
walking here on your own.

33:39.268 --> 33:41.562
It ain't safe around here.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.480
Yeah, I know.

33:45.816 --> 33:48.527
But I don't scare too easy either, Jake.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.532
You know,
you don't have to tell me.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.118
You could just show me.

33:57.911 --> 34:01.665
And if you show me where Candyman is,
I'll make you a promise.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.460
It'll be our secret.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.550
Unless you're too scared.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.355
Somebody building a bonfire?

34:25.481 --> 34:27.775
Yeah, for the party.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.252
In there.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.505
Candyman's in there?

34:49.630 --> 34:51.005
My friend Charlie says so.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.217
A boy got killed there.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.472
Who was he?

34:58.597 --> 35:01.391
Ain't sure.
Charlie tell me he was weird.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.519
He was crazy?

35:03.644 --> 35:05.687
No, a retard.

35:05.813 --> 35:08.398
His mom was in the store.

35:10.526 --> 35:12.903
And the boy, he needed to go,
you know, to the bathroom.

35:14.571 --> 35:18.575
His mom was taking her time,
choosing this, looking at that.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.285
So the boy started moaning.

35:20.410 --> 35:24.164
His mom get mad at him,
sent him across the street.

35:24.289 --> 35:27.709
His mom was at the checkout.
She hears her boy screaming.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.545
'Mommy!

35:29.670 --> 35:30.921
'Mommy!'

35:31.713 --> 35:33.590
There's a big tough guy.

35:33.715 --> 35:35.342
He runs over to check it out.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.680
Come out of there
shaking and crying.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.516
He only been in there five seconds.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.937
Come out of there
and his hair turned white.

35:48.105 --> 35:50.649
I mean, it turned white, just like that.

35:51.567 --> 35:54.069
- Was the boy murdered?
- Worse.

35:54.194 --> 35:58.365
He's lying on the floor in a pool of blood,
holding himself.

36:00.242 --> 36:02.786
'Mommy! Mommy!'

36:04.329 --> 36:07.207
They found it floating in a toilet.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.918
Can't fix that. Better off dead.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.046
Did Candyman do this?

36:20.637 --> 36:22.306
Listen, you wait here for me, OK?

36:22.431 --> 36:23.724
OK.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.243
Hello?

37:59.403 --> 38:00.988
Candyman.

38:19.006 --> 38:20.966
Oh, excuse me.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.135
I'm done here.
I'll just get out of your way.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.555
Listen, I don't want to interfere
with your business.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.396
I'm not a cop.

38:34.521 --> 38:37.232
I'm from the University of Illinois.

38:38.358 --> 38:39.860
Erm...

38:40.736 --> 38:42.404
I'll just get out of your way.

38:42.529 --> 38:45.282
Hey, come on! Let me go!

38:45.407 --> 38:47.242
Look, you're not being very smart.

38:47.367 --> 38:50.245
My colleagues know where I am
and they're expecting me back.

38:50.370 --> 38:51.663
Now let me go!

38:55.042 --> 38:57.711
I hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.381
Well, you found him.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.859
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.486
Step back.

39:26.073 --> 39:28.742
Number four,
step forward and say the line.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.870
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.580
Step back.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.544
Number five,
step forward and say the line.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.797
We hear you're looking
for Candyman, bitch.

39:41.922 --> 39:44.466
Step back.
Take them out.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.313
He's number five.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.774
Good work.

40:04.027 --> 40:05.570
How'd you catch him?

40:05.695 --> 40:07.447
We swept the place.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.533
We start from the top floor
and work our way down.

40:09.658 --> 40:12.119
That way you can flush them all out.

40:12.244 --> 40:14.287
Whole of Cabrini's locked down now.

40:14.413 --> 40:16.998
You're very lucky to be alive, Ms. Lyle.

40:20.627 --> 40:23.797
- Did he kill Ruthie Jean?
- Oh, no question.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.424
Killed that poor kid as well.

40:25.966 --> 40:28.343
He ran the Overlords.

40:28.468 --> 40:31.012
Oh, we knew everything about him.

40:31.138 --> 40:35.183
Only reason why we didn't bring him in before
because we couldn't find anyone to testify.

40:36.101 --> 40:39.771
We can't protect them down
at Cabrini-Green, and they knew that.

40:41.148 --> 40:43.108
What about the little boy, Jake?

40:44.067 --> 40:46.987
We don't need him.
We have you.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.744
Hey, Jake.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.254
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

41:04.838 --> 41:06.214
I wanna go home.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.049
We'll get you out of here
right away, kid.

41:08.175 --> 41:09.885
You did good.

41:10.010 --> 41:12.888
You said it was our secret.
You lied.

41:13.013 --> 41:16.391
It still is, Jake.
You won't have to go to court.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.105
Candyman will get me.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.442
Candyman isn't real.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.236
He's just a story.

41:28.361 --> 41:31.490
You know, like Dracula or Frankenstein.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.828
A bad man took his name
so he could scare us.

41:36.953 --> 41:39.456
But now that he's locked up,
everything's gonna be OK.

41:41.249 --> 41:43.418
Candyman ain't real?

41:44.753 --> 41:46.171
No.

41:52.719 --> 41:53.929
Hey, dear!

41:54.054 --> 41:56.890
Whoa! Slow down!
You're supposed to be the invalid here.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.535
No, no, no, it's much better.
Look. See? It's much better today.

41:59.559 --> 42:00.685
Yeah, it looks great.

42:00.810 --> 42:02.938
Come sit down.

42:18.203 --> 42:21.289
- You haven't eaten already, have you?
- No, of course not.

42:22.207 --> 42:23.208
OK, good.

42:41.142 --> 42:42.644
Hey!

42:42.769 --> 42:44.646
Welcome back.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.773
- Thanks.
- Let me see.

42:48.316 --> 42:51.820
I'm so glad you're OK.
I would've totally freaked.

42:51.945 --> 42:54.281
Yeah, but you know
what bugs me about the whole thing?

42:54.406 --> 42:56.908
Two people get brutally murdered
and the cops do nothing.

42:57.033 --> 42:59.619
Whereas a white woman goes in there and gets
attacked, and they lock the place down.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.997
Yeah, I know,
but this was a bad guy.

43:02.122 --> 43:04.916
You got him put away.
That's all that matters.

43:06.167 --> 43:09.504
- Oh! I've got a surprise for you.
- What?

43:09.629 --> 43:11.631
You're not gonna believe it.

43:13.383 --> 43:14.467
The pictures!

43:14.593 --> 43:18.096
A friend of mine in the photography
department managed to save most of them.

43:18.888 --> 43:20.724
I'd written them off.
The camera was smashed.

43:22.309 --> 43:23.685
That's not all.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.478
I've been talking to some publishers,

43:25.604 --> 43:29.232
and there's a lot of interest
since you made the local section.

43:29.357 --> 43:30.650
We're gonna be published.

43:31.776 --> 43:34.487
Alright. So I'll come over tomorrow at
9:00, and we'll get started, right?

43:34.613 --> 43:35.614
- Yeah.
- OK.

44:16.237 --> 44:18.114
'Helen.'

44:20.116 --> 44:21.701
Yes?

44:21.826 --> 44:24.204
'Helen.'

44:31.336 --> 44:32.962
Who is that?

44:36.591 --> 44:38.218
Who is that?

44:40.720 --> 44:42.097
Helen.

44:42.222 --> 44:44.641
I came for you.

45:05.161 --> 45:06.746
Do I know you?

45:06.871 --> 45:07.997
No.

45:08.790 --> 45:12.252
No, but you doubted me.

45:13.294 --> 45:15.130
I'm sorry. I have to go.

45:15.255 --> 45:17.799
No need to leave yet.

45:22.846 --> 45:24.806
But I'm late.

45:25.473 --> 45:28.351
You are not content with the stories,

45:28.476 --> 45:31.104
so I was obliged to come.

45:38.445 --> 45:39.863
Be my victim.

45:43.867 --> 45:46.119
Be my victim.

45:49.289 --> 45:52.542
'I am the writing on the wall,

45:52.667 --> 45:55.003
'the whisper in the classroom.

45:55.754 --> 45:59.382
'Without these things,
I am nothing.

45:59.507 --> 46:03.219
'So now,
I must shed innocent blood.

46:03.887 --> 46:05.597
'Come with me.'

46:18.526 --> 46:20.069
No!

46:36.044 --> 46:37.921
Anthony!

46:38.588 --> 46:40.089
Anthony!

46:42.467 --> 46:45.470
No, no! No!

46:45.595 --> 46:47.847
No! Anthony!

46:47.972 --> 46:50.391
Anthony!

46:57.273 --> 46:59.984
Anthony! No!

47:00.109 --> 47:01.694
Anne-Marie?

47:01.820 --> 47:04.405
You bitch! You bitch!

47:04.531 --> 47:06.449
- Stay back! Stay back!
- Where's my baby?

47:06.574 --> 47:08.451
Where's my baby?

47:08.576 --> 47:09.786
My baby!

47:10.745 --> 47:12.288
You murderer!

47:12.413 --> 47:14.499
You... No!

47:15.333 --> 47:17.836
Stop!
Please, stop! Stop.

47:22.882 --> 47:24.968
Now, stop! Stop!

47:25.760 --> 47:27.470
Police! Open up!

47:28.012 --> 47:29.556
Alright, hold it right there!

47:29.681 --> 47:30.765
Back away! Now!

47:32.350 --> 47:33.810
Look out, look out!

47:52.120 --> 47:53.246
Remove your sweater.

48:01.087 --> 48:03.423
Drop it and slide it over to me.

48:07.468 --> 48:08.678
Take off your brassiere.

48:10.972 --> 48:13.349
Can I please take a shower?

48:17.729 --> 48:19.814
Oh, God.

48:21.733 --> 48:23.693
Drop it, slide it over to me.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.115
Lift up your arms.

48:32.201 --> 48:33.953
Lift your left breast.

48:35.163 --> 48:36.581
Your right.

48:41.336 --> 48:42.337
Remove your underwear.

48:43.296 --> 48:46.591
Can I please speak
with Detective Valento?

48:46.716 --> 48:48.718
Remove your underwear.

48:52.513 --> 48:54.057
Frank.

49:01.940 --> 49:05.068
Ms. Lyle, you're under arrest.
Do you understand?

49:09.948 --> 49:12.075
Please let me explain.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.077
Do you understand?

49:16.871 --> 49:19.332
- Yes, but...
- You have the right to remain silent.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.626
Do you understand?

49:22.627 --> 49:24.462
This is crazy. I was attacked.

49:24.587 --> 49:26.089
Respond to the question!

49:29.050 --> 49:30.635
I understand.

49:31.594 --> 49:33.721
At approximately 10:00pm,

49:33.846 --> 49:36.683
Anne-Marie McCoy
returned to her apartment.

49:37.892 --> 49:41.312
She discovered her dog
with its head cut off.

49:41.980 --> 49:43.564
She cried for assistance,

49:43.690 --> 49:47.151
at which point you attacked her
with a meat cleaver.

49:47.819 --> 49:50.279
You were still in possession
of this weapon

49:50.405 --> 49:53.950
when the arresting officers
came to her aid.

49:54.075 --> 49:55.743
Where's the baby?

49:58.204 --> 49:59.664
I don't know.

49:59.789 --> 50:01.124
You're sick.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.299
Before I ask
any further questions,

50:10.425 --> 50:12.844
would you like to have counsel?

50:14.053 --> 50:16.889
Yes or no?

50:18.474 --> 50:21.269
I would like
to make a phone call.

50:37.577 --> 50:39.537
'I'm sorry,
we can't take your call.

50:39.662 --> 50:41.330
'Please leave a message
after the tone.'

50:42.707 --> 50:44.917
Trevor, are you there?
Pick up.

50:47.420 --> 50:50.131
It's an emergency, Trevor.
Pick up the phone!

50:51.716 --> 50:55.845
'I've been arrested.
I'm at the 18th District.

50:55.970 --> 50:59.223
'Can you...
Can you please come pick me up?'

50:59.849 --> 51:01.601
That's it.

51:03.227 --> 51:05.271
Do you know what time it is?

51:06.105 --> 51:07.774
3:00am.

51:53.861 --> 51:54.862
Oh, God.

51:56.697 --> 51:58.491
There's gotta be
another way out of here.

51:58.616 --> 52:00.993
Cover her face.
Don't say anything.

52:01.119 --> 52:03.579
- Just have to walk to the car.
- OK? That's it.

52:03.704 --> 52:04.704
Alright. Here we go.

52:04.789 --> 52:07.959
You'll be fine. Stick with me.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.670
There she is!
There she is!

52:10.795 --> 52:12.380
Just keep your head down.

52:18.803 --> 52:21.514
Alright, people. Back off. Back off.
We have no comment.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.266
Absolutely no comment.
Nothing to say.

52:23.391 --> 52:26.144
We have absolutely nothing to say!
No comment!

52:26.269 --> 52:28.146
My client has not been charged
with a thing!

52:28.271 --> 52:30.439
'...some information has indicated

52:30.565 --> 52:33.442
'that baby Anthony was abducted
and may still be alive.

52:34.235 --> 52:35.862
'The blood
may have come from the dog.

52:35.987 --> 52:39.574
'A suspect was released this morning
after questioning,

52:39.699 --> 52:42.827
'and I guess we'll just have
to follow this one as it...'

52:43.828 --> 52:47.832
Well, at least they didn't
mention your name. That's good.

52:51.752 --> 52:55.089
Now, they haven't charged you
because they think they'll find the body.

52:55.214 --> 52:58.426
Which means, I'm afraid,
they're shooting for murder one,

52:58.551 --> 53:00.970
but I don't think they have a chance.

53:06.184 --> 53:08.019
Do you think I did it?

53:08.144 --> 53:09.687
No, nobody believes that.

53:12.148 --> 53:13.399
But it's crossed your mind?

53:18.112 --> 53:19.572
Is there anything,

53:19.697 --> 53:22.283
any detail, however small,

53:22.408 --> 53:26.829
that you can recall that would help us
substantiate your version of events?

53:26.954 --> 53:30.124
I... I blacked out. I mean, I...

53:30.249 --> 53:32.335
I don't know what happened.

53:33.085 --> 53:36.214
I just woke up in that place
and there was blood everywhere.

53:55.149 --> 53:56.400
Can I get you anything?

54:00.738 --> 54:02.657
Are you sure?

54:13.960 --> 54:16.128
Look, honey, I was supposed
to go over to the campus

54:16.254 --> 54:17.630
and pick up some work.

54:17.755 --> 54:20.424
I'm concerned about leaving you alone,
though.

54:22.885 --> 54:25.054
- I'll only be about 20 minutes.
- Trevor?

54:28.849 --> 54:30.810
Where were you last night?

54:31.560 --> 54:34.105
I was here. I was fast asleep.

54:34.230 --> 54:36.816
I thought you were with Bernadette.

54:39.652 --> 54:43.447
Look, honey,
I'm gonna stand by you.

54:44.448 --> 54:46.993
We're gonna get through this, OK?

54:48.661 --> 54:49.912
I'll be right back.

58:13.616 --> 58:15.326
Believe in me.

58:15.451 --> 58:17.036
Be my victim.

58:26.295 --> 58:28.047
Come on.

58:28.172 --> 58:29.632
Please.

58:32.927 --> 58:35.137
'Do you believe in me?'

58:35.679 --> 58:37.181
Keep away from me!

58:37.306 --> 58:39.725
'I have the child.

58:39.850 --> 58:42.853
'Allow me to take you,
or he will die in your place.'

58:45.147 --> 58:46.273
No!

58:49.151 --> 58:53.447
'Your disbelief destroyed
the faith of my congregation.

58:53.572 --> 58:56.075
'Without them, I am nothing.

58:56.200 --> 58:58.285
'So I was obliged to come.

58:59.370 --> 59:01.205
'And now I must kill you.'

59:03.624 --> 59:06.669
Your death will be a tale
to frighten children,

59:06.794 --> 59:09.922
to make lovers cling
closer in their rapture.

59:12.049 --> 59:15.010
Come with me and be immortal.

59:29.483 --> 59:30.483
Helen?

59:36.782 --> 59:38.367
Bernadette.

59:41.829 --> 59:43.497
Bernadette, go.

59:44.164 --> 59:45.666
Helen?

59:47.084 --> 59:47.918
Helen, honey, it's...

59:48.043 --> 59:49.878
Bernadette, let me in.

59:50.004 --> 59:51.672
He's here.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:04.101
Bernadette. Go!

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:06.061
Helen!

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.063
Helen?

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:10.024
Go on! Get out!

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.944
Oh!

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:16.947
Oh, no, no, no.

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:45.476
Trevor...

01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:47.853
Trevor, he's here.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:51.732
He's here. He's here.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.113
'Don't let him kill me.'

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:03.535
Trevor?

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:14.046
Trevor!

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.425
Trevor!

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:21.470
Trevor!

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:26.558
Trevor. Trevor!

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:27.976
- Hey, hey.
- Trevor! Trev...!

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:38.570
Take her outside.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:42.533
Trevor.

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.994
Hold me, Trevor, please?

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:10.811
'Why do you want to live?

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.648
'If you would learn just a little from me,

01:02:14.773 --> 01:02:17.526
'you would not beg to live.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:20.028
'I am rumor.

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:22.948
'It is a blessed condition, believe me.

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:26.452
'To be whispered about
at street corners.

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:31.373
'To live in other people's dreams,
but not to have to be.

01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:35.878
'Do you understand?'

01:03:02.863 --> 01:03:06.492
'Please, God,
don't let him kill the baby.'

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.644
Trevor!

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:37.189
Trevor?

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:41.109
Trevor!

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.961
Where are you going?

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.713
No, you can't leave me here!

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:04.716
I can't defend myself!

01:04:25.696 --> 01:04:26.947
No.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.952
'What do the good know,

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:35.080
'except what the bad teach them
by their excesses?'

01:04:35.998 --> 01:04:37.291
Murderer.

01:04:37.416 --> 01:04:40.294
Allow me at least a kiss.

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:43.630
Just one exquisite kiss.

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.508
Murderer!

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:47.926
Help!

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.095
Listen, he's under the bed!

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:54.266
Bring me 1,000 mills.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:57.728
Listen. He's here.
He's under the bed!

01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.354
No. Don't.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.753
She's coming around.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.880
Morning.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:09.549
I'd like to speak to my husband.

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:11.677
So would I.

01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:14.554
- There we go.
- What time is it?

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.641
- Where are we going?
- We're going to Disneyland.

01:06:31.238 --> 01:06:33.490
Clyde, open it up.

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:35.909
Winley? Clyde, open it up.

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:39.955
What the hell are you
all doing back there, huh? Huh?

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.707
A little reading? Huh?

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:43.875
Freak.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.257
- Dr. Burke?
- Yes.

01:06:54.428 --> 01:06:56.930
Ms. Lyle, I'm Dr. Burke.

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:08.316
I'd like to speak to my husband.

01:07:08.442 --> 01:07:10.610
I'm sure we can arrange a visit.

01:07:10.736 --> 01:07:12.612
A visit?

01:07:12.738 --> 01:07:14.114
Have I been committed?

01:07:20.412 --> 01:07:23.373
Do you really think these restraints
are necessary?

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:33.550
Helen, this is a writ of detention
from the state attorney's office.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.553
- Now, for the past month...
- Month?

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:38.430
Yes.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:41.058
We've been stabilizing you
on a heavy dosage of Thorazine.

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:45.228
You probably remember
very little, or nothing.

01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:47.814
Get me my attorney.

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:50.108
I'm working for your defense.

01:07:51.026 --> 01:07:53.779
We have to assess
your ability to stand trial.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.448
Helen,

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:59.493
you've been charged
with first-degree murder.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.879
Why don't you tell me what happened
in your apartment?

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:44.662
The night you were admitted,

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.747
did the killer appear to you?

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:49.542
'Murderer! Murderer!

01:08:50.085 --> 01:08:53.296
'Murderer! Help me!

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.801
'He's here!
He's under the bed!'

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.557
- 'Help me!'
- I don't understand.

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:06.935
'Help! Please! He's here!

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:11.273
'Help me!
Help me! Please!

01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:13.859
- That...
- 'He's under the bed. He's under the bed.'

01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:15.484
That's not possible.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:16.653
'Bring me 1,000 mills.'

01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:24.202
Bernadette.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.506
I'm not capable of that.

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:44.930
No matter what's going wrong,

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:49.978
I know one thing -
that no part of me,

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.229
no matter how hidden,

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.316
is capable of that.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.324
I can prove it.

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:03.949
How?

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:08.413
I can call him.

01:10:19.925 --> 01:10:23.261
Candyman, Candyman,

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:26.306
Candyman, Candyman,

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:38.777
Candyman.

01:11:13.228 --> 01:11:15.272
You're mine now.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:21.444
Tonight our congregation
shall witness a new miracle.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.257
Dr. Burke?

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:45.552
Dr. Burke, open the door!

01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:48.430
Dr. Burke!

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.726
Dr. Burke, please answer.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:55.937
Dr. Burke!

01:12:25.759 --> 01:12:29.012
'Code nine, ward B-5, stat.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.432
'Code nine, ward B-5, stat.'

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.145
Check the west wing!

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.940
All clear! Right!

01:12:41.066 --> 01:12:42.692
Let's go! Go, go, go!

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.699
We have a direction on this one?
Where is she?

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:12.931
Please be home, Trevor.
Please be home.

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.782
Get out of my home.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.995
Trevor!

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.206
What's the matter, sweetie pie?
Did you make another little boo-boo?

01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:24.127
What are you doing here?

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:27.422
I live here. Remember?

01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:30.049
Call the hospital.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:35.138
Don't touch the phone.

01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:51.863
What's the matter, Trevor?

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.034
Scared of something?

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.839
I hate the color scheme.

01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:18.097
What were you gonna do, Trevor?
Wait till I got out before you told me?

01:15:18.223 --> 01:15:19.516
Helen.

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:24.020
You knew I was never coming out,
didn't you?

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:27.732
I think we should call the hospital.

01:15:31.069 --> 01:15:32.529
OK.

01:15:34.906 --> 01:15:36.950
Go on.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.286
Go on.

01:15:40.954 --> 01:15:42.121
Is that what you wanna do?

01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:46.167
Call them.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.861
I'm not a murderer.

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:17.282
I'm not...

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:21.327
Trevor, you were all I had left.

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:46.060
It's over.

01:16:58.031 --> 01:17:01.534
'If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.'

01:17:22.472 --> 01:17:25.308
'They will all abandon you.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:41.074
'All you have left
is my desire for you.'

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:32.054
'Helen.

01:21:35.099 --> 01:21:37.226
'You came to me.'

01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.813
The child...

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:44.734
We had a deal.

01:21:44.859 --> 01:21:47.320
Surrender to me now,

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:50.990
and he shall be unharmed.

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:04.879
'We have a bargain.'

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:06.339
And I'm afraid.

01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:09.884
'Do you fear the pain,
or what is beyond?'

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:11.010
Both.

01:22:11.135 --> 01:22:15.264
'The pain,
I can assure you, will be exquisite.

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:18.434
'As for our deaths,
there is nothing to fear.

01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:23.731
'Our names will be written
on a thousand walls,

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:28.319
'our crimes told and retold
by our faithful believers.

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:32.949
'We shall die together
in front of their very eyes

01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:36.953
'and give them something
to be haunted by.'

01:22:38.913 --> 01:22:41.457
Come with me

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:43.542
and be immortal.

01:22:56.347 --> 01:22:58.265
No!

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.480
No!

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:09.068
No!

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.094
'You're mine now.

01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:38.931
'It's time for a new miracle.'

01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:03.933
'It was always you, Helen.

01:25:04.058 --> 01:25:05.893
'It was always you.'

01:26:23.012 --> 01:26:24.889
He's here.

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:01.508
I'm coming.

01:27:06.931 --> 01:27:07.973
It's OK.

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:09.975
Check it out, man.

01:27:13.938 --> 01:27:14.938
Yes.

01:27:17.191 --> 01:27:19.693
- What happened?
- They got Candyman out there!

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:23.822
Candyman's in there!
I saw him go in there! I saw his hook!

01:27:23.948 --> 01:27:27.576
The Candyman's in there!
I saw his hook!

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:34.875
I knew you'd come.

01:27:36.961 --> 01:27:38.128
Burn him.

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:44.510
Shh!

01:27:44.635 --> 01:27:46.720
Burn him! Burn him!

01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:49.265
Burn him! Burn him!

01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:50.808
Burn him! Burn him!

01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:56.814
Help! Help!

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:59.858
Burn him! Burn him!
Burn him! Burn him!

01:27:59.984 --> 01:28:02.319
Help! Help me!

01:28:05.656 --> 01:28:07.658
You lied to me!

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:12.121
'We must be
on our way now, you and I.

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:15.040
'Our bones will soon be ashes,

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:18.377
'and we shall never be separated again.'

01:28:19.295 --> 01:28:21.046
Let me go.

01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:25.301
'I cannot.
We are already dead.'

01:29:09.803 --> 01:29:11.722
Come back to me!

01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:25.152
Come back!

01:30:35.806 --> 01:30:37.933
We commend to Almighty God,
our sister, Helen,

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.394
and we commit her body
to the ground.

01:30:40.519 --> 01:30:44.356
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

01:30:45.232 --> 01:30:48.485
The Lord bless her and keep her
and give her peace.

01:30:49.862 --> 01:30:51.196
God of holiness and power,

01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:54.450
accept our prayers,
on behalf of your servant, Helen.

01:30:54.575 --> 01:30:56.493
Do not count her deeds against her,

01:30:56.618 --> 01:30:59.872
for in her heart she desired
to do your will.

01:30:59.997 --> 01:31:04.877
May Almighty God bless you,
the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.637
My God. Look at that.

01:31:18.265 --> 01:31:19.850
Trevor?

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:36.260
Trevor?

01:32:37.511 --> 01:32:39.012
What is it?

01:32:39.888 --> 01:32:41.682
Trevor, are you alright?

01:32:41.807 --> 01:32:43.642
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:32:45.561 --> 01:32:47.354
Aren't you hungry?

01:32:49.147 --> 01:32:51.567
No, I'm OK.
I'll eat a little bit later.

01:32:51.692 --> 01:32:54.736
I was gonna make us a nice dinner.

01:32:54.861 --> 01:32:56.572
OK. Whatever.

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:43.619
Hey, why don't you help me
make the salad?

01:33:44.578 --> 01:33:46.955
OK. I'll be there in a minute.

01:33:56.423 --> 01:33:58.342
Helen.

01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:10.312
Oh, Helen.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.943
Helen.

01:34:22.783 --> 01:34:24.409
Helen.

01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:32.000
Helen.

01:34:33.585 --> 01:34:34.836
Ow.

01:34:39.633 --> 01:34:41.343
What's the matter, Trevor?

01:34:42.386 --> 01:34:43.804
Scared of something?

01:34:54.231 --> 01:34:56.108
Trevor?

01:34:56.233 --> 01:34:57.901
My God, Trevor?

01:34:59.111 --> 01:35:00.487
Trevor?

01:35:01.697 --> 01:35:03.323
Trevor?
