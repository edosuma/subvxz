00:08.009 --> 00:10.409
D'oh.

00:29.196 --> 00:33.098
Oh, I was standing in this
line to use the bathroom,

00:33.100 --> 00:34.733
but now my license
is expired.

00:34.735 --> 00:38.804
Hey Dad, there's an arcade
across the street.

00:38.806 --> 00:42.574
And there's really no point
in all of us waiting in line.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.009
Hmm.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.551
Oh, I was invited to that party.

00:59.326 --> 01:02.261
Oh, that's good.

Woo-hoo, first in line.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.733
Brought you a gift bag.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.836
All that's left

01:10.838 --> 01:12.204
That's the worst Runt.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.806
Back of the line, stranger.
Huh?

01:13.808 --> 01:17.843
We used our last day of summer
vacation standing in this line,

01:17.845 --> 01:20.079

for our reward.

Half a cheesesteak.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.719
I'll perform at
your birthday party.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.655
Sober.
Quarter of a cheesesteak.

Hello, "Selma."

01:47.675 --> 01:50.209
I'd like to submit
a change of address.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.579

Mr. Munster?

01:53.581 --> 01:54.413
Excuse me?

01:54.415 --> 01:59.685
Dad, Aunt Selma's treating a mob
boss like an ordinary taxpayer.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.321
And we've got
front-row seats.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.890
So, you here

02:04.892 --> 02:07.159
Read this.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.528
Process my form.

02:09.530 --> 02:13.765
I'm afraid this is
the wrong form.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.600
The one you want

02:14.602 --> 02:18.237
is on that table.
And if I retrieve
that form,

02:18.239 --> 02:22.774
will I be able to maintain my
advantageous position in line?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.277

Nope.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.260
(loud rattling)

02:41.262 --> 02:43.829
Geez, we had a safe
full of gold in there

02:43.831 --> 02:45.731
and it didn't ride so low.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.902
My lick.

Hey, you licked the back.
That was my side.

Aw, brother germs!

Aw, sister spit!

03:07.621 --> 03:09.588
Hmm.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.891
Bart, this is a truffle.

03:12.893 --> 03:13.692
You're a truffle.

03:13.694 --> 03:17.396
A truffle is a fungus
that grows in tree roots.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.465
It's one of the most prized
gourmet foods in the world.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.335
Only you can make
tree poop boring.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.771
(sniffs)

03:27.875 --> 03:31.543
(gasps) Bart, you can
find them by smell.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.377
That's amazing.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.547
Restaurateurs use highly-trained
pigs to sniff these out.

03:35.549 --> 03:40.485
Come on, numb nose.
Sniff me a truffle.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.355
I don't know why
I flew you in from Italy.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.856
First class, no less.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.925
Plus you forget
to get the miles.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.560
Interested in these?

03:48.562 --> 03:51.597
Eh?
Jody Maroni.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.832
But where is
your truffle pig?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.567
You're lookin' at him.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.802
A human pig.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.571
Thank you, Lord,
for this abomination.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.505
(squealing)
Eh, eh, eh.

04:00.507 --> 04:04.476
You know-a the rule:
no truffles for truffle pigs.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.510
(dejected squeal)

04:05.512 --> 04:07.879
And now that I have him,

04:07.881 --> 04:10.249
I find a new use
for you

04:10.251 --> 04:12.351
in my kitchen.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.320
Yeah, that one's-a good.

04:15.322 --> 04:17.422
Start on these.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.591
Hey, don't run
with the knife.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.993
Ah, stupid pig.

04:20.995 --> 04:25.364
And I'll-a pay you top dollar
for any more truffles you find.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.634
And whenever you eat here,
you get the best table.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.403
Not one that goes
a-tikit-a-tikit-a-tikit-a.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.504

04:39.046 --> 04:41.613
The view was better
inside the sack.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.949
You are one tough cookie.

04:43.951 --> 04:48.820
I tell you what, I'll let
you pick which body part
I cut off first.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.789
Fine.
I choose my love handles.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.725
What?
Then my arm wattles,
my cankles,

04:53.727 --> 04:55.894
and finish off
with my excess back fat.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.463
You do not register
the level of fear,

04:58.465 --> 04:59.898
say, Louie here would.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.500
Yeah-- show some respect
for the process.

05:01.502 --> 05:05.637
You asked what I wanted cut
off, and I want lipo.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.673
Lots of lipo.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.509
Or are you not a man
of your word?

05:10.511 --> 05:12.944
(chuckles)

05:12.946 --> 05:13.845
I like you.

05:13.847 --> 05:16.348
I don't know whether to knock
you on your kisser

05:16.350 --> 05:17.382
or kiss you on your knockers.

05:17.384 --> 05:22.454
I don't know whether to
peck you on the kisser,
or kiss you on the...

05:22.456 --> 05:23.622
You shall have your lipo.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.091

who owes us a favor.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.392
Actually, we owe him a favor.

05:27.394 --> 05:32.931
Do him two favors, then remind
him that he owes us a favor.

MAN:
<i>Tony, the surgery was</i>
<i>a complete success,</i>

05:35.002 --> 05:40.439
so can I take your cousin,
the "anesthesiologist"

05:40.441 --> 05:41.640
off the payroll?

05:41.642 --> 05:42.808
You certainly may.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.077
Now where is my Selma?

05:45.079 --> 05:49.014
Here's the part
that's not in the trash.

05:49.016 --> 05:49.948
Ooh.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.918
Boys, I'd like a little
privacy with Selma.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.820
Why don't you take
the doctor out back?

05:54.822 --> 05:59.124
Should we take care of him,
or "take care of him"?

05:59.126 --> 06:01.426
Take care of him.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.527
I don't know
what that meant.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.895
Was it the first one
or the second one?

06:03.897 --> 06:06.398
I can't ask him, otherwise
he's gonna "take care of me."

06:06.400 --> 06:08.834
Now to take care of you.

06:08.836 --> 06:13.538
Take care of me or
"take care of me"?

when you've got a waist.

store asked me if I needed help.

I hope I'm not
interrupting.

06:43.103 --> 06:43.835
Um, Fat Tony.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.639
I was just complimenting
your beautiful girlfriend,

06:47.641 --> 06:49.875
while insulting
her hideous twin.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.610
I'm sorry, Fat Tony.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.045
My husband doesn't
realize what he's saying,

06:54.047 --> 06:56.548
then, five seconds
later...

06:56.550 --> 06:57.649
Oh, my God.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.751
All will be
forgiven.

06:59.753 --> 07:04.890
If you sketch a portrait of
Patty showing her inner beauty.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.126
You are cruel
but fair.

gonna propose here.

Shut up. You're
spoilin' the mood.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.802
Fat Tony!
Are you going to cut my head off

11:43.804 --> 11:45.804
and leave it in a manger scene
at Christmas,

11:45.806 --> 11:47.739
and then an old Italian nun
finds it?

11:47.741 --> 11:50.241
And she's all,
"Oh, no, no, no!

11:50.243 --> 11:52.210
(sobbing):
"Oh, no, no!

11:52.212 --> 11:55.246
He's too beautiful
to die!"

11:55.248 --> 11:57.082
(sobbing)

11:57.084 --> 11:59.517
Homer, to restore
the sisterical bond,

11:59.519 --> 12:02.821
you and Marge are invited
to spend the weekend

12:02.823 --> 12:06.157
with us at our house
down the shore.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.892
HOMER:
Mmm.

12:07.894 --> 12:08.927
(gasps)

12:08.929 --> 12:10.795
So should I bring a towel?

12:10.797 --> 12:12.097
We have towels.

12:12.099 --> 12:17.168
(whispering): Um,
I take a special size.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.002
(sniffing)

12:18.004 --> 12:20.538
Come on, Bart. We've
been out here for hours.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.407
Maybe we've found
all the truffles.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.942
The only thing
I've dug up

12:23.944 --> 12:26.111
was these
weird-looking mushrooms.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.779
I'll dispose
of those for you.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.982
<i>Koyaanisqatsi,</i>
you're about to get watched.

12:30.984 --> 12:34.786
Listen, why don't we just
stop this and divide the money?

12:34.788 --> 12:37.088
The money?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.957
The money is working for us.

12:38.959 --> 12:42.026
What's not working
is your stupid sense of smell.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.562
All I smell here
is desperation.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.397
(grunts)

12:46.399 --> 12:47.966
(gasps)

12:51.905 --> 12:56.074
Ooh. Commentary by Philip Glass.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.976
(bird squawks)

12:57.978 --> 12:59.410
(muffled mumbling)

12:59.412 --> 13:00.311
Huh?

13:00.313 --> 13:01.980
No more distractions.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.815
Find those truffles.
Mush!

13:03.817 --> 13:07.218
If you think that makes me
a better musher, you're wrong.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.120
(grunts) Wait a second.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.322
(sniffing)

13:11.324 --> 13:12.991
Huh?

13:12.993 --> 13:13.792
This is our house.

13:13.794 --> 13:19.130
There's nothing buried here
but hopes and dreams.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.832
(sniffing)

13:23.036 --> 13:25.236
The truffle's
right over here.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.575
The truffle's
in your room?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.277
I thought you'd
been selling them.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.847
Bart, I haven't
been selling the truffles.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.448
I've been eating them.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.817
Really? Why?

13:38.819 --> 13:41.286
Vegetarian food
is so boring.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.287
Pasta, soy.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.589
You know what's
a bad pizza topping?

13:44.591 --> 13:45.857
Broccoli!

13:45.859 --> 13:46.591
But I worked so hard.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.427
I've got dirt under my
fingernails I'll never get out.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.029
Not that I'm going to try.

13:51.031 --> 13:51.529
I'm sorry, Bart.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.299
Take the last truffle.
Do whatever you want.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.366
Sell it, eat it.

13:55.368 --> 13:59.304
Or give it to someone
who deserves it.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.372
You spent your life
searching for these,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.374
but you never had one.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.577
Well, this is yours.

14:05.579 --> 14:09.414
Bart, you've done a
truly kind thing.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.349
(sniffing)

14:11.351 --> 14:14.285
(squeals)

14:14.621 --> 14:17.355
(diners screaming, murmuring)

14:21.561 --> 14:24.095
(sniffs, squeals)

14:24.097 --> 14:25.330
Aah! Hey!

14:25.332 --> 14:29.300
Oh, so that's why they
don't give pigs truffles.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.169
(pig squeals)

14:31.338 --> 14:33.471
I don't think this
is a good idea at all.

14:33.473 --> 14:37.442
The only husband of Selma's
I liked was Disco Stu.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.244
He was so upbeat--

14:39.246 --> 14:42.146
till he found out
she didn't care for disco.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.481
Yeah, that's his thing.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.351
Anyway, Fat Tony and I
think this is a chance

14:46.353 --> 14:48.386
to patch things up
between you and Selma.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.322
Plus, it's a free
weekend at the beach.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.925
Hey, Louie.
Don't ask me why,

14:53.927 --> 14:57.161
but I got a funny feeling
about the new guy.

14:57.163 --> 15:00.498
Uh, let's brag
about our crimes.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.034
You first.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.471
Homer, Marge.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.972
Come meet the family.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.240
These are my nephews,

15:09.242 --> 15:12.610
Stevie B., Stevie F.
and Vincent.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.513
Yeah, but you can call us
S-Money, Jell-O Shot

15:15.515 --> 15:17.115
and The Occurrence.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.050
I will.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.251
This is my niece, Tushie.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.687
She's got two semesters
under her belt

15:22.689 --> 15:25.356
in Contemporary
Italian-American Design

15:25.358 --> 15:28.359
from Sandy Hook
Vocational Institute.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.595
Ah, shut your
face, Uncle Tone.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.132
God, you two
are super pale.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.033
But not to worry--

15:35.035 --> 15:37.702
every light in the house
is a tanning light.

15:37.704 --> 15:38.536
Ooh.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.004
Can you read by it?

15:40.006 --> 15:41.272
No one's ever tried.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.540
(techno music playing)

15:42.542 --> 15:44.742
(giggling):
Yeah!

15:44.744 --> 15:47.578
These people are always grinding
against each other,

15:47.580 --> 15:49.347
and I think they're all related.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.482
I wish we'd never come.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.951
Selma?!

15:52.953 --> 15:54.352
Va-va-va... wha...?!

15:54.354 --> 15:56.387
Why can't you
support my marriage?

15:56.389 --> 15:58.256
You've never
supported mine.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.223
You married a pig.

15:59.225 --> 16:02.260
Well, you married someone
whose first name is Fat.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.028
(both groan)

16:04.030 --> 16:06.397
I'm late for my
mani-pedi-spray-tan.

16:06.399 --> 16:10.401
(power tools grinding,
Selma grunting)

16:10.403 --> 16:12.570
(jackhammering)

16:12.572 --> 16:14.372
Ah, yeah!

16:14.374 --> 16:15.306
Huh?

16:15.308 --> 16:18.309
(indistinct chatter)

16:18.311 --> 16:19.310
(laughs) Yeah!

16:19.312 --> 16:21.245
Boo-freaking-ya!
Losers chug!

16:21.247 --> 16:24.182
(chuckling):
Well, if you insist.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.385
ALL:
Chug! Chug! Chug!

16:27.387 --> 16:29.053
Chug! Chug! Chug!

16:29.055 --> 16:32.156
Ooh, yeah. (chuckles)

16:32.592 --> 16:34.325
Mind if I join you?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.727
Look at our men, Marge.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.729
They're having a great time.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.099
You are such a
gentle kisser.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.634
You were kind of
all over the place.
Ooh!

16:43.636 --> 16:45.103
Maybe I've been
mean to Homer

16:45.105 --> 16:47.538
because I was jealous
of your happiness.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.073
Now that I'm
truly happy,

16:49.075 --> 16:52.176
maybe all four of us
can start over.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.312
Hmm.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.716
♪ Tell me,
when will you be mine? ♪

16:58.718 --> 17:02.086
♪ Tell me, quando,
quando, quando? ♪

17:02.088 --> 17:03.354
♪ Hey! ♪

17:03.356 --> 17:04.355
(sighs)

17:04.357 --> 17:06.257
The boys needed to breathe.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.592
Wouldn't they be girls?

17:07.594 --> 17:09.460
Mine are boys.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.461
Hmm.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.629
(groans)
(grunts)

17:11.631 --> 17:14.232
(moaning and groaning)

17:15.268 --> 17:18.236
(grunts) Which is
our room again?

17:18.238 --> 17:19.670
You know-- it had that painting

17:19.672 --> 17:22.507
of that lady and the monster
on the ceiling.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.076
That was a mirror.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.210
Looking good, boss.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.246
Yeah, you look
like Johnnie Handsome

17:28.248 --> 17:29.647
before we shot him
in the face.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.784
Hey, I got to look
good for my goomar.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.485
(gasps) Goomar?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.821
That's mob talk for "mistress."

17:36.823 --> 17:38.723
Fat Tony has a mistress.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.492
He's cheating on Selma?
That's crazy.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.795
Why go out for
a hamburger

17:43.797 --> 17:46.798
when you got rancid
steak at home?

17:46.800 --> 17:50.268
Uh, I'll just sit here quietly.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.569
(squeaking)

17:51.571 --> 17:52.403
Sorry.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.106
(plastic squeaking loudly)

17:58.845 --> 18:02.413
(sobbing)

18:02.415 --> 18:04.782
How could Tony
cheat on me so soon?

18:04.784 --> 18:07.185
You know, Selma,
from what I've seen here,

18:07.187 --> 18:10.455
Fat Tony has a lot
of bad influences on him.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.757
I walked
through a door last night,

18:12.759 --> 18:14.692
and they were playing cards...

18:14.694 --> 18:16.160
(whispering):
for real money.

18:16.162 --> 18:19.764
Well, Homer and I are going
to take you away right now.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.132
Oh, can't we stay one more day?

18:21.134 --> 18:24.135
The Occurrence and I are going
to the tanning salon

18:24.137 --> 18:26.771
and get oiled and broiled.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.172
(both grunt)

18:28.174 --> 18:31.409
Sorry, The Occurrence,
but to use your lingo,

18:31.411 --> 18:33.744
Homer and I have
to be "that guy."

18:33.746 --> 18:36.314
Whoa!
You don't want to be that guy.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.149
I don't want to
be that guy,

18:38.151 --> 18:41.285
but Marge is making
me be that guy.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.520
Enough!

18:43.123 --> 18:44.755
Homer, good morning.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.458
May I interest you
in a pool noodle?

18:47.460 --> 18:50.761
We also got pool ziti,
pool fusilli--

18:50.763 --> 18:56.100
or if you don't like those,
Mama will make you one special.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.905
Mother Mary herself
couldn't make

19:00.907 --> 19:03.274
a noodle big enough
to float this one.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.809
<i>In nomine patris et filli...</i>

19:04.811 --> 19:06.177
Tony, we have to leave.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.612
For the record,
I want to emphasize

19:07.614 --> 19:10.882
we're not leaving because
today is "cleanup."

19:10.884 --> 19:12.383
Leave? Why?

19:12.385 --> 19:15.153
Because you have a girlfriend!

19:15.155 --> 19:15.653
Oh.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.857
It is true,
but it is not what you think.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.895
Where is she?
Where is this other woman?

19:23.897 --> 19:25.196
You're the goomar?

19:25.198 --> 19:26.898
I'm Fat Tony's wife.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.499
You're the goomar.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.700
You're nuts.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.469
And I've got the
ring to prove it.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.905
(scoffs)
That's a goomar ring.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.407
This is a wife ring.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.909
(grunts)

19:37.911 --> 19:40.211
(gasps)
That's a wife ring?

19:40.213 --> 19:40.912
Marge, don't look.

19:40.914 --> 19:42.880
This doesn't
make any sense.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.448
There was a wedding.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.284
You exchanged vows.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.485
I can explain.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.821
<i>If you spoke Italian,</i>
<i>which I knew you did not,</i>

19:50.823 --> 19:56.427
<i>you would have known that those</i>
<i>were goomar-goombah vows.</i>

20:14.714 --> 20:18.416
Marge, if I ever tell you
I want to get married again,

20:18.418 --> 20:21.219
I want you to stick
your thumbs into my eyes.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.753
Yeah, we can show you
how to do it.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.489
The trick is, you don't stop
till you hear a pop.

20:25.491 --> 20:30.661
You missed my first open house
as a licensed real estate broker

20:30.663 --> 20:32.296
for this<i> brutta puttana?</i>

20:32.298 --> 20:34.966
(groans) I've hit on
enough pizza boys

20:34.968 --> 20:36.767
to know what
that means.

20:36.769 --> 20:37.468
(grunts)

20:37.470 --> 20:39.570
Then, bring it on,
sister!

20:39.572 --> 20:42.340
(fierce grunting)

20:42.342 --> 20:43.975
(whispering):
You were right, Marge.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.943
These people
are not for us.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.880
In a good marriage,
you never say, "I told you so."

20:49.882 --> 20:54.252
Which is lucky for me,
because you're always right.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.586
Oh.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.788
BOTH:
Mmm.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.992
("Theme from<i> Bonanza"</i> plays)

21:52.312 --> 21:53.644
Shh!
