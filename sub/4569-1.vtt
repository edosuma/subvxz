02:36.843 --> 02:40.224
<i>The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain</i>

02:40.324 --> 02:43.572
<i>The bear went over the mountain
To see what he could see</i>

02:43.672 --> 02:46.751
<i>To see what he could see
To see what he could see</i>

02:46.851 --> 02:49.581
<i>And when he got over the mountain
And when he got over the mountain</i>

02:49.681 --> 02:52.518
<i>And when he got over the mountain
What do you think he saw?</i>

02:52.618 --> 02:55.365
<i>What do you think he saw?
What do you think he saw?</i>

02:55.465 --> 02:58.237
<i>A bullet in his brain
A bullet in his brain</i>

02:58.337 --> 03:00.693
<i>A bullet in his brain</i>

03:00.793 --> 03:02.982
- Pow!
- Pow!

03:05.786 --> 03:09.056
Have you seen this? This is the video
of that cat getting flushed down a toilet.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.089
Look.

03:14.427 --> 03:16.130
Fat kid does karate.

03:16.230 --> 03:20.367
Homeless man drop-kicks pedestrian.
Have you seen this one?

03:20.867 --> 03:22.236
I don't have a phone.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.805
First graders have cell phones.
Get a phone.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.341
Cell phones emit
electromagnetic radiation.

03:27.441 --> 03:31.978
Radiation affects brainwaves,
attention levels, testosterone.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.016
I'm not worried about my testosterone.
I'm worried about you.

03:34.116 --> 03:35.733
What if somebody needs
to get in touch with you?

03:35.833 --> 03:38.118
- What somebody?
- What if there's an emergency?

03:38.218 --> 03:41.388
- What emergency?
- I'm... the emergency is hypothetical.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.991
I'm hypothesizing that at some point
you might need to get in touch

03:44.091 --> 03:48.860
- with a member of the human race.
- Nah. I have a dog.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.437
Speaking of dogs, do you remember
when we spray-painted

03:54.537 --> 03:56.822
that Cocker Spaniel
that lived next door?

03:56.922 --> 03:59.427
I remember being grounded for 17 months.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.176
One time...

04:03.276 --> 04:07.481
when the old man was changing
his carburetor on that piece of shit C10,

04:07.581 --> 04:10.851
I threw a golf ball
at a bottle of Pennzoil.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.754
Direct hit. His face was covered
in transmission fluid.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.223
You're lucky the old man
didn't choke you with the fan belt.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.089
I was lucky that you were
always there to save my ass.

04:21.726 --> 04:24.695
To my big brother. Welcome back.

04:25.998 --> 04:27.865
Are we there yet?

04:29.001 --> 04:32.005
- I have to pee.
- You're a peeing machine.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.508
You... Are you okay?
Are you experiencing kidney failure?

04:34.608 --> 04:38.612
Do you need dialysis? Seriously. Why is it
that women need to pee every 17 miles?

04:38.712 --> 04:41.148
Can we just find a gas station?

04:41.248 --> 04:43.150
Honey, we are going camping,
not antiquing.

04:43.250 --> 04:47.004
At some point, you're gonna have
to tinkle amongst the trees.

04:47.104 --> 04:49.267
Come here.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.855
I want to go antiquing.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.499
Walter, I didn't mean to leave you

05:08.599 --> 05:11.912
with your dick in your hand
with the Rothman account.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.672
Yeah, no, something came up.

05:15.772 --> 05:19.149
I'm not gonna be back
in the office till Monday.

05:21.674 --> 05:23.457
Tell Bridget...

05:23.557 --> 05:28.393
make sure Bridget confirms the conference
call and CCs me on the invoice.

05:34.612 --> 05:36.420
This too.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.519
Thanks.

05:45.711 --> 05:47.347
Oh, sorry.

05:47.447 --> 05:50.774
It'll die. Eventually.

05:50.874 --> 05:53.087
His battery? It'll run out.

05:53.187 --> 05:58.456
- I was hoping he wouldn't get reception.
- Yeah. No outlets in the woods.

05:59.291 --> 06:02.693
He'd better hope I don't feed
that phone to my dog.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.163
Can I have the bathroom key?

06:29.922 --> 06:31.691
I thought you guys said
you'd been here before.

06:31.791 --> 06:35.695
When we were kids. I guess
there's been some budget cuts.

06:35.795 --> 06:39.733
- Well, how can they close a state park?
- They can't.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.833
Little chain-link never stopped
the Neary family.

06:46.605 --> 06:49.609
Isn't there, like, a fine or something
if someone catches us?

06:49.709 --> 06:52.056
There's nobody here. The place is dead.

07:02.421 --> 07:06.059
10 years old, front tooth
is loose but won't come out.

07:06.159 --> 07:09.863
Dad hands me that model 70,
and the recoil knocks my tooth right out.

07:09.963 --> 07:13.300
From that day forward, Dad always
called this rifle the Tooth Fairy.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.202
I hate that gun.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.369
Come here. Come on.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.746
Walnut stock, mauser action.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.181
I'll take Dad's old Winny
any day of the week.

07:28.281 --> 07:32.152
Old is the operative word.
You stick with your iron sights.

07:32.252 --> 07:36.189
I'm going with an EBR-2B HD zoom radical
with a 75-yard Parallax setting

07:36.289 --> 07:38.392
and real-time ballistic calibration.

07:38.492 --> 07:42.616
That's not hunting. That's cheating.

07:47.233 --> 07:50.403
Look at that. Map says
there's a kid's museum.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.706
- Kiddie museum?
- What trail are we taking?

07:52.806 --> 07:56.076
We don't follow the trails.
We follow the animals.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.545
Well, I'll follow you.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.514
I'm directionally challenged.

08:00.614 --> 08:04.618
Don't worry, we won't get lost.
We got GPS.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.054
And so does the dog.
I got Buck a present.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.022
Come here, Buck.

08:09.122 --> 08:12.026
Real-time GPS.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.329
The red dot is Buck.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.510
He can chase down the deer.
We find Buck, we find Bambi.

08:29.241 --> 08:33.880
Hey, litterer.
What if some little kid steps on that?

08:33.980 --> 08:37.405
Then some little kid can sue me
for negligent disposal

08:37.506 --> 08:39.410
of mediocre American beer.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.354
Little kids are real litigious
these days.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.297
Let's go hunting.

08:57.069 --> 09:01.305
Alcohol and firearms.
A Neary family tradition.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.597
I don't see anything.

09:57.697 --> 10:01.134
Just 'cause you don't see 'em
doesn't mean they're not there.

10:01.234 --> 10:05.102
We're not watching them,
they're watching us.

10:09.842 --> 10:14.279
As long as we can find this dot,
we find our way back.

10:15.648 --> 10:20.584
Hansel and Gretel used breadcrumbs.
Sean prefers spray paint.

10:23.121 --> 10:25.433
It's biodegradable.

10:32.130 --> 10:35.198
Woods are the only weapon you need.

10:35.734 --> 10:39.940
Yeah, well, I need something
a little more heavy-duty.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.942
PETA must love this.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.876
All is fair in love and online shopping.

10:51.683 --> 10:54.454
A real hunter doesn't give chase.

10:54.554 --> 10:57.387
A real hunter is already there.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.870
Close your eyes.

10:59.970 --> 11:02.310
Count to three.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.412
One...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.835
two...

11:08.935 --> 11:10.950
three.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.483
Oh, God!

11:28.253 --> 11:29.665
I hate it when he does that.

11:38.263 --> 11:42.402
<i>First time hunters hesitate to kill
because their emotions interfere.</i>

11:42.502 --> 11:44.238
<i>Emotions are a mistake.</i>

11:45.438 --> 11:48.041
Watch, wait.

11:48.141 --> 11:52.176
- Be ready to pull the trigger.
- She's totally ready.

11:53.278 --> 11:56.382
She's got her game face on.

11:56.482 --> 11:59.918
I don't know if you knew this about my wife,
but she's a very competitive person.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.623
Beginner's luck.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.192
Now don't worry, honey. No pressure.

12:06.292 --> 12:10.129
I've never seen anyone
bag a buck on their first try.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.701
We'll see about that.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.524
Like I said, competitive.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.084
That dog never takes his eyes off you.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.563
That dog saved my life.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.164
Several times.

14:25.264 --> 14:28.066
Please tell me that isn't our dinner.

14:29.568 --> 14:32.505
- Tastes better than it looks.
- I'm vegan.

14:32.905 --> 14:35.272
I'll pick you some pinecones.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.145
Come here.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.728
Come take a cut.

14:40.828 --> 14:44.214
Come on. I thought you went
to med school.

14:48.253 --> 14:52.857
If you want to exsanguinate,
you cut the carotid.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.798
All right, so I guess blood
doesn't exactly bother you.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.835
My first year of residency,
I did an ER rotation.

15:01.935 --> 15:05.722
They gurneyed in a four-year-old boy with
bullet wounds from a drive-by-shooting.

15:05.822 --> 15:10.143
A bullet had ruptured his orbital plate
causing subarachnoid hemorrhaging.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.477
He bled to death in my arms.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.183
So...

15:17.283 --> 15:19.252
no.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.785
Blood doesn't bother me.

15:22.979 --> 15:27.524
I saw a 13-year-old get burned alive
outside a madrasa.

15:28.493 --> 15:31.431
Couple of PFCs got drunk,
got a can of gasoline,

15:31.531 --> 15:34.400
took a Bic lighter to her burqa.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.556
They called it "Hot Potato."

15:38.171 --> 15:41.238
Court martial called it a "thrill kill."

15:42.007 --> 15:45.178
A bear will kill because it's defensive.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.849
A lion will kill because it's hungry.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.816
Man's the only animal
that kills because it's fun.

15:53.686 --> 15:57.487
Don't get too close.
You might cut yourself.

15:58.657 --> 16:02.159
I didn't mean to interrupt the tutorial.
Please proceed.

16:04.696 --> 16:09.266
I smell like viscera. I'm going
for a swim if anyone cares to join.

16:10.402 --> 16:13.723
- No peeking, pervert.
- Scout's honor.

16:36.929 --> 16:41.198
Beware the creature
from the algae-filled cesspool!

16:48.575 --> 16:53.146
You're like a... pilot fish
that latches onto dorsals.

16:53.246 --> 16:56.279
It's a symbiotic relationship.

16:58.317 --> 17:01.754
This is totally the type of lake from which
a two-headed creature might emerge.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.924
Polycephalic creatures don't scare me.

17:05.023 --> 17:10.729
Brain-eating amoebas, on the other hand?
This lake is filled with parasites.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.794
Builds your constitution.

17:13.894 --> 17:17.303
Sean and I used to pee in the pool
every day growing up.

17:17.403 --> 17:21.240
- It was like swimming in lemonade.
- Wait, are you peeing right now?

17:21.790 --> 17:23.991
We should put in a pool.

17:26.144 --> 17:30.316
- Pools are a lot of work.
- Yeah. But it could be a lot of fun.

17:30.416 --> 17:33.854
Oh, we could have pool parties.

17:34.454 --> 17:38.057
You know, if we ever have kids.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.995
Kids scare me. They're so short.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.689
Why can't we ever have
this conversation?

17:47.232 --> 17:51.335
I'm sorry, Wit. I have a lot on my mind.
My job, my brother.

17:52.337 --> 17:55.775
You know, he's been sleeping in his car
ever since he's been back.

17:55.875 --> 18:00.046
He got a job at a construction site.
He got fired for showing up drunk.

18:00.346 --> 18:03.850
When we had that drink at the bar,
he told me that he isn't just on leave.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.018
He told me he was discharged,
but he won't tell me why.

18:06.118 --> 18:09.088
This was supposed to be our weekend.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.758
You and me making... S'mores.

18:12.858 --> 18:17.096
Making logistically-challenging love
in a sleeping bag.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.699
- He's my brother.
- I'm your wife.

18:19.799 --> 18:23.770
This is literally the longest conversation
we've had in three weeks.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.567
We need to talk, Mike.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.839
I need to talk to you.

18:31.509 --> 18:34.057
Talk to me about what?

18:38.517 --> 18:40.349
Sorry.

18:40.986 --> 18:44.325
Walter, look, indices
are down, the S&P... Yeah.

18:57.152 --> 19:02.108
A Boy Scout is trustworthy, loyal,
helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,

19:02.208 --> 19:05.912
obedient, cheerful, thrifty,
brave, and relevant.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.512
Reverent.

19:09.615 --> 19:12.185
I'm pretty sure it's relevant.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.287
How could a Boy Scout be relevant?

19:14.387 --> 19:16.990
Sean here made it
all the way to Eagle Scout.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.458
- Dad always liked you more.
- Shut up.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.494
- I bet you were cute as Boy Scouts.
- We were not cute. We were monsters.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.330
We used to push over Port-a-Potties
at the state fair.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.500
We used to stuff raw meat
into people's mufflers.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.603
We used to hotwire cars
in the shopping mall parking lot.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.092
We'd break into golf courses
and shoot at squirrels.

19:33.192 --> 19:35.808
Poster children
for the gun control lobby.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.878
Shouldn't Boy Scouts
be singing "Kumbaya"?

19:38.978 --> 19:41.981
The Neary family
is notoriously tone-deaf.

19:42.081 --> 19:45.651
Our mom used to sing us lullabies
despite the fact that she couldn't sing.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.640
At all. But no matter what...

19:48.740 --> 19:52.025
if we were having nightmares
or we were too afraid to sleep,

19:52.125 --> 19:55.161
she'd come into our room and sing
"The Bear Went Over the Mountain."

19:55.561 --> 19:58.698
Like she could protect us
from all the evil in the world.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.664
All the boogeymen under our bed.

20:02.384 --> 20:04.805
Fucking song's been stuck
in my head for 30 years.

20:06.405 --> 20:09.575
Tomorrow, we hunt the old-fashioned way.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.978
No GPS.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.929
No cheating.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.915
Fine, then. I'll give it to my wife.

20:20.285 --> 20:23.624
She's directionally challenged.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.425
This way...

20:26.525 --> 20:28.861
I can see you...

20:28.961 --> 20:31.428
if you can't keep up tomorrow.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.102
Tomorrow I think I'm just gonna
do some yoga and finish my book.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.738
That's a good idea.
We should all do some yoga.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.640
Maybe roast some tofu.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.042
Really, you don't want to go hunting?

20:43.342 --> 20:46.512
I'm not exactly the hunting type.

20:46.612 --> 20:50.049
I don't have it in me. I just...

20:50.149 --> 20:52.785
I don't think I could actually kill.

20:52.885 --> 20:58.024
I think you'd be surprised at what
you can do when it needs to be done,

20:58.124 --> 21:01.858
when it's fight or flight,
kill or be killed.

21:02.794 --> 21:05.314
Self-preservation.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.769
- You ever hear the story of Artemis?
- Greek goddess of hunting.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.805
Artemis was just a little girl
when Zeus sent her into the woods

21:12.905 --> 21:15.175
to fight the big, black bear Calisto.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.244
Artemis decided that,

21:18.344 --> 21:23.015
in order to defeat the bear,
she would have to become a bear.

21:23.115 --> 21:27.420
So she cut off all her little girl hair,

21:27.520 --> 21:32.558
she threw away
all of her little girl clothes,

21:32.658 --> 21:35.694
she tied bearskin to her own skin,

21:35.794 --> 21:38.332
she tied bear teeth to her own teeth.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.135
She learned to walk on all fours.

21:42.235 --> 21:46.606
And then one day,
she walked into the woods.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.874
And into the cave.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.877
Disguised from head to toe
in bear hides,

21:51.977 --> 21:56.479
she approached
the hibernating black bear.

21:57.349 --> 22:02.721
Calisto... believing that she was
his little cub,

22:02.821 --> 22:07.357
cradled Artemis in his arms,
went back to sleep.

22:08.593 --> 22:11.864
That's when Artemis found a rock,

22:11.964 --> 22:15.935
and, with a strength
she never knew she had,

22:16.035 --> 22:18.575
she broke his skull.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.841
Later that night,

22:21.941 --> 22:25.111
walking back to the village,

22:25.211 --> 22:28.481
bearskin tied to her own skin,

22:28.581 --> 22:32.118
bear teeth tied to her own teeth,

22:32.218 --> 22:37.991
holding in her hands the head
of the big, black bear Calisto,

22:38.591 --> 22:43.596
Artemis, it was decided,
was no longer a girl.

22:43.996 --> 22:48.231
In that village, on that night...

22:49.934 --> 22:53.688
Artemis became a god.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.377
Shit.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.214
Sorry. I have to take this.

23:06.351 --> 23:08.921
I hope a bear eats his cell phone.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.854
Walter, hey, yeah,
I'm in the middle of nowhere...

23:13.859 --> 23:16.595
Smoke inhalation.

23:16.695 --> 23:20.600
Mosquitoes. Moths.

23:21.300 --> 23:25.271
I've determined I'd much rather read
about nature than experience it.

23:25.371 --> 23:27.440
Guess you were never a Girl Scout.

23:28.474 --> 23:30.743
I had a brief stint in the Brownies.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.913
They kicked me out because I said
selling cookies was misogynist.

23:34.013 --> 23:38.114
They kicked Mike out of Boy Scouts
for eating a pair of socks.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.520
He took a game of Truth or Dare too far.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.260
Truth or Dare is a dangerous game.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.564
You wanna play?

23:49.093 --> 23:52.465
Because Walter, Walter, listen.
They are highballing the valuation.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.533
The IP will flatline.
This is not a blue chip.

23:54.633 --> 23:59.371
This is a barely liquid piece
of undercapitalized Dutch horseshit.

23:59.471 --> 24:02.408
There's blood in the water,
and the boys with the fins can smell it.

24:02.508 --> 24:06.012
This is survival of the fittest.
Sink or swim, Walter.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.251
Walter?

24:08.514 --> 24:10.116
Oh, shit.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.282
Walter?

24:43.581 --> 24:45.687
Shit.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.825
God.

24:57.512 --> 24:59.999
All right, Buck, you bastard.
We're taking a selfie.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.468
You son of a bitch.

25:02.868 --> 25:05.436
One, two, three, buddy. One, two, three.

25:08.574 --> 25:11.310
You Eagle Scouts
sure make amazing S'more.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.680
Just a minute,
I have chocolate on my face.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.683
- Wash it down.
- I'm a lightweight.

25:17.983 --> 25:19.352
Truth or Dare?

25:19.923 --> 25:21.887
Truth.

25:22.555 --> 25:25.392
Why did you get discharged?

25:31.830 --> 25:35.801
When we were kids, we used
to play war in the woods.

25:35.901 --> 25:42.541
We'd run around with our little plastic
guns and hide behind the pine trees.

25:42.641 --> 25:46.011
You'd get one point each
for every kid that you killed.

25:46.111 --> 25:49.081
And I killed every kid
in the neighborhood.

25:49.181 --> 25:52.351
They'd all fall down and play dead.

25:52.451 --> 25:57.423
The forest floor would be covered with all
these little bodies laying in the mulch.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.992
Till dinner time.

26:00.092 --> 26:03.396
Then they all got up and went home.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.628
Game over.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.637
Truth or Dare?

26:11.737 --> 26:13.639
Truth.

26:13.739 --> 26:17.198
When's the last time
you and Mike made love?

26:24.182 --> 26:25.518
Sorry...

26:25.618 --> 26:28.687
- I didn't make it to the wedding.
- It wasn't your fault.

26:28.787 --> 26:32.858
Besides, the chocolate
fountain malfunctioned.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.894
You didn't miss much.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.996
Mike sent me photos.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.866
Of you and the dress.
You looked beautiful.

26:40.966 --> 26:43.569
I looked blotchy.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.771
Irish skin.

26:45.871 --> 26:50.873
Mike's a lucky man
to find a woman like you.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.018
You got chocolate on your face.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.487
It's getting late.

27:01.587 --> 27:04.153
I'm gonna go to bed.

27:04.790 --> 27:07.893
Put this pooch on a leash, please.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.627
Let's hit the hay, little lady.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.804
Mike?

27:26.611 --> 27:28.607
Mike?

28:29.340 --> 28:31.343
Wake up.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.976
Mike, wake up.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.851
Where the hell's the tent?

28:38.951 --> 28:41.454
Somebody must have cut it.

28:41.554 --> 28:44.224
Wait. What's that?

28:45.624 --> 28:48.918
- Where's our stuff?
- I don't...

28:50.958 --> 28:54.533
- Where's Sean?
- I... don't...

28:56.008 --> 28:58.437
- Gone. Everything's gone.
- Shit.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.495
Sean?

29:01.307 --> 29:04.009
Sean! Sean!

29:04.109 --> 29:05.756
Our shoes are gone.

29:05.856 --> 29:08.007
- Someone took our shoes.
- Of course.

29:08.107 --> 29:11.383
Of course he picked this weekend
to go totally PTSD on me.

29:11.483 --> 29:14.353
Why would Sean steal our stuff?

29:14.785 --> 29:16.889
Because he stopped taking his meds?

29:16.989 --> 29:19.158
Because he's gonna become
a hermit and live off the grid?

29:19.258 --> 29:21.860
Because he's jealous of me... of us?

29:21.960 --> 29:24.329
I don't know, Wit.
I don't know why he did it.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.665
And I definitely don't know
what he's gonna do next.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.134
How do we know it was him?

29:29.234 --> 29:31.570
- Who else could it be?
- They came from the east.

29:31.670 --> 29:35.192
Down the declivity, right past me.
They cut to the left of the fire...

29:35.892 --> 29:37.576
right here. They took all our stuff.

29:37.676 --> 29:40.228
They cut your tent,
went off to the west over here.

29:40.328 --> 29:42.458
And where exactly were you
when this was happening?

29:42.558 --> 29:45.317
- I was sleeping.
- You must sleep pretty goddamn deep.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.619
I drank a fifth of whiskey.

29:46.719 --> 29:49.378
Are you telling me that somebody came,
and they took our tent, took our food,

29:49.478 --> 29:53.272
took our water, and drew X's on our heads,
and you didn't hear or see a fucking thing?

29:53.372 --> 29:56.262
- Neither did you.
- Neither did I. I had my headphones on.

29:56.362 --> 29:59.531
Sean. Buddy. Remember
when we were in high school,

29:59.631 --> 30:02.568
and we were drinking Wild Turkey,
and I woke up wearing women's underwear?

30:02.668 --> 30:05.871
If this is your idea of a practical joke,
it really isn't funny.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.084
It might've been funny when you were drunk
and you decided to fuck with us, but...

30:09.184 --> 30:13.056
this is not funny. I'm hot, I'm hung over,
and I'm not in the mood to fuck around.

30:13.156 --> 30:16.819
Where's the stuff, Sean?
Where's my cell phone? Seriously.

30:16.919 --> 30:19.368
I have e-mails I have to send,
I have conference calls I have to make.

30:19.468 --> 30:21.836
- Where is my cell phone? I need it?
- Calm down.

30:21.936 --> 30:25.524
Don't tell me to calm down.
Sean, where's my phone?

30:25.624 --> 30:28.527
- They must have taken it.
- Who is they? What... who is they?

30:28.627 --> 30:32.214
There was three of them, Mike.
Three sets of prints that aren't ours.

30:32.314 --> 30:35.400
You could have made the tracks yourself.
You could have put the X on your head.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.804
- This could all be part of your little game.
- It's not a game, Michael.

30:38.904 --> 30:41.199
They took our guns.

30:41.299 --> 30:43.812
The knives. They took my dog.

30:43.912 --> 30:46.879
- Maybe your dog just ran away.
- He didn't, okay?

30:46.979 --> 30:50.482
It doesn't make sense.
Sean, who would take our stuff?

30:50.582 --> 30:52.203
Let's not stick around
to find out, okay?

30:52.303 --> 30:54.361
Let's just get out of here
and get back to the car.

30:54.461 --> 30:58.023
- Come on, let's go.
- It's okay. I can hotwire the car.

30:58.123 --> 31:02.359
Well, how do we find the car if we didn't
take the trails and we don't have a map?

31:04.529 --> 31:07.024
The sun's our map.

31:37.194 --> 31:39.998
I really don't wanna step on a snake.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.935
I think I just stepped in poison oak.

31:43.035 --> 31:47.639
- It has to be 100 degrees.
- I'm considering drinking my own sweat.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.509
It was nice of them to steal
our entire water supply.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.876
Them? Or him.

31:55.829 --> 31:57.783
I don't think he's taking us
back to the car.

31:57.883 --> 32:00.219
Where would he be taking us?

32:00.319 --> 32:03.285
Just stay close to me.

32:07.725 --> 32:10.796
Okay. Keep heading east.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.564
When you get to the spray paint
compass point,

32:12.664 --> 32:15.667
it's gonna be three miles
past that to the east.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.973
You guys want to get there by sundown,
you need to keep going.

32:18.073 --> 32:20.222
- Are you not coming with us?
- No. I'm not.

32:20.322 --> 32:22.875
I'm not gonna leave Buck behind, Mike.
I'm not gonna leave my dog.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.209
So you want us to leave you behind.

32:24.309 --> 32:28.514
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. You guys keep
going. Just get going. Take that path.

32:28.614 --> 32:32.167
- That path is not the path we took before.
- Take my word for it, Mike.

32:32.267 --> 32:34.546
I'm not taking directions from you.
Okay, compadre?

32:34.646 --> 32:37.122
You're not exactly in the right mindset
to be giving turn-by-turn navigation.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.557
Can we just think about this
for a second?

32:38.657 --> 32:39.992
I think he's sending us
in the wrong direction.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.594
- Let's just think about it.
- He's sending us deeper into the woods.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.731
He's your brother. We have to trust him.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.963
Wait, are you telling me that you actually
believe my brother's little theory?

32:49.063 --> 32:52.410
That there's some totally
random backwoods...

32:52.510 --> 32:54.773
constitutional extremist
just randomly fucking with us?

32:54.873 --> 32:57.542
Because I believe that my brother
is suffering a psychotic breakdown,

32:57.642 --> 33:00.696
- and that's why he stole our goddamn gear.
- I didn't steal the gear.

33:00.796 --> 33:03.599
Well, I don't believe you.
Come on, Wit. Let's go.

33:03.699 --> 33:07.385
Wit, come on. I said let's go.

33:08.287 --> 33:11.790
Are we taking sides here? Is that's
what's happening? Is that what's going on?

33:11.890 --> 33:14.373
Don't think that I don't see
what's happening here.

33:14.473 --> 33:16.318
Have you seen the way that he...
he keeps looking at you,

33:16.418 --> 33:20.129
the way that he keeps touching you?
What is going on?

33:20.966 --> 33:23.635
I saw you last night!

33:23.935 --> 33:25.504
I saw my brother touching your face.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.139
- What is happening?
- Mike.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.708
The campfire, the moonlight,
looked like a real tender moment to me.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.844
I've been trying to tell you.

33:31.944 --> 33:35.807
Trying to tell me what, Wit?
That you want to fuck my brother?

33:35.907 --> 33:39.227
- Sean, do you want to fuck my wife?
- Fuck you.

33:41.486 --> 33:43.621
- Mike, stop.
- I'm pregnant.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.790
Mike!

33:48.693 --> 33:50.881
I'm pregnant.

33:58.269 --> 34:01.114
I'm gonna go find my dog.

34:20.291 --> 34:22.824
How long have you known?

34:23.761 --> 34:25.563
Last week.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.000
Kept retaking the test.

34:28.100 --> 34:32.168
Took me 10 times peeing on the stick
before I believed it.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.507
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

34:36.608 --> 34:39.543
I didn't wanna tell you over e-mail.

34:39.643 --> 34:42.313
Seemed a little informal.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.783
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

34:44.882 --> 34:47.052
Just wait, I...

34:47.152 --> 34:49.387
I'm sorry.

34:49.487 --> 34:53.891
I am... so sorry.
I should have been there.

34:53.992 --> 34:56.527
But I'm here.

34:56.628 --> 35:00.596
Now. For you. For us.

35:01.865 --> 35:05.537
You're the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.070
But this...

35:10.574 --> 35:13.142
This is even better.

35:20.751 --> 35:22.868
Let's go home.

35:38.369 --> 35:41.740
- Where the hell is the spray paint?
- Sean said it was east.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.776
Yeah, well, Sean's a little
dissociative right now.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.079
Wait... that's it.

35:47.179 --> 35:50.014
That's it. That's it.

35:50.114 --> 35:52.348
Good job.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.752
So, east.

35:57.255 --> 35:59.288
Wait.

36:13.604 --> 36:15.638
We're lost.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.610
Sean!

36:23.848 --> 36:25.900
Fuck!

38:20.964 --> 38:23.184
Hey!

39:49.853 --> 39:53.222
You killed my dog. Now I kill you.

39:56.460 --> 39:58.397
Okay.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.627
Okay, down, yeah.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.593
- All right, you all right?
- Yeah.

41:08.232 --> 41:10.081
Esther.

41:12.369 --> 41:14.973
- Elvina.
- Yeah.

41:15.073 --> 41:17.742
Elwina?

41:18.042 --> 41:22.347
- Mildred, Mildred.
- Those are grandmother names.

41:22.447 --> 41:24.549
Okay, how about...

41:24.649 --> 41:27.686
Mitch, Chuck. Hank.

41:27.786 --> 41:30.155
No, those are baseball player names.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.056
- Yeah.
- Besides,

41:32.156 --> 41:35.326
how do you even know we're having a boy?

41:35.426 --> 41:37.651
Just a feeling.

41:40.398 --> 41:42.167
I feel nauseous.

41:42.921 --> 41:45.715
Here. Sit down.

41:47.003 --> 41:49.082
Sit down.

41:52.348 --> 41:54.412
Take a... a deep breath.

41:54.512 --> 41:58.716
Careful, pregnant women
are prone to projectile vomit.

41:58.816 --> 42:01.119
Oh, really?

42:01.511 --> 42:04.355
Are they prone to...

42:04.455 --> 42:07.826
- pickle eating, is that a thing?
- No. No pickles. Not right now.

42:07.926 --> 42:10.659
All right, just breathe.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.436
- Please tell me that's not a mirage.
- What?

42:18.536 --> 42:20.438
Water!

42:21.133 --> 42:23.451
What is that?

42:32.816 --> 42:33.904
Wait.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.079
Mike.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.417
Mike!

43:27.938 --> 43:29.356
It's disconnected!

43:38.115 --> 43:40.424
Try another channel.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.854
Hello, is anyone...

43:43.154 --> 43:46.584
We're at the forest preservation...
inside the ranger station.

43:46.684 --> 43:49.959
We need medical assistance.
This is an emergency.

43:51.829 --> 43:53.331
Static.

43:53.731 --> 43:56.632
Fuck! Fuck!

43:59.169 --> 44:00.551
Okay.

44:06.810 --> 44:08.997
- You severed tendons.
- Jesus.

44:09.097 --> 44:11.830
I have to disinfect the wound.

44:16.319 --> 44:18.290
We have to find a way out of here.

44:21.315 --> 44:23.729
This is the lake. And...

44:24.829 --> 44:27.215
these are the trails.

44:27.515 --> 44:29.267
We can't take the trails.

44:29.367 --> 44:32.538
He's expecting us to take the trails.
We have to take the long way.

44:33.638 --> 44:36.071
- We have to climb that cliff.
- There's no way.

44:36.171 --> 44:38.455
- It's the only way.
- Your foot is broken.

44:38.555 --> 44:41.446
The cartilage is torn.
You're not scaling rocks.

44:42.134 --> 44:45.183
No. You are.

44:45.283 --> 44:48.004
You have to find the car, Wit.
Find help.

44:48.104 --> 44:50.788
- We don't have the keys.
- The steering panel pulls apart.

44:50.888 --> 44:53.758
The red wire is the starter.
The brown wire's the piston.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.444
- Just make the wires make a spark.
- I can't hotwire a car.

44:56.544 --> 44:59.964
I can't climb a cliff.
I can't do this alone, Mike.

45:00.064 --> 45:02.297
You're not.

45:03.967 --> 45:06.058
You're not.

45:07.338 --> 45:10.066
How can this be happening?

45:11.575 --> 45:14.078
This weekend totally sucks.

45:14.178 --> 45:16.315
- Yeah.
- I suck.

45:17.515 --> 45:21.619
I promise, first thing that we'll do
when we get home

45:22.019 --> 45:24.272
is we'll put my phone in the microwave.

45:24.372 --> 45:29.057
It'll explode like fireworks
while we make love on the kitchen floor.

45:29.926 --> 45:34.232
- I'm gonna be a good husband.
- You're gonna be a good dad.

45:34.332 --> 45:36.882
You're gonna be a great dad.

45:37.669 --> 45:41.214
- I'm not good with diapers.
- You'll be fine.

46:26.717 --> 46:28.786
All right, listen...

46:28.886 --> 46:31.656
I'm gonna walk out the door,
and I'm gonna get him to follow me, okay?

46:31.756 --> 46:34.152
You're gonna sneak out the window,
and when he starts to chase me,

46:34.252 --> 46:36.327
- you're gonna run the other way.
- No, I'm not leaving without you.

46:36.427 --> 46:39.738
- No, I... I'll be right behind you.
- We have to stay together! No!

46:39.838 --> 46:42.875
Listen to me, listen to me. Take this.

46:42.975 --> 46:45.203
- Take this.
- I'm not going without you.

46:45.303 --> 46:48.879
I will be right behind you.
Listen to me. Take these.

46:49.941 --> 46:52.076
I will meet you at the car.

46:52.176 --> 46:53.845
- Okay? I love you.
- I love you. I love you.

46:53.945 --> 46:56.612
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.

47:22.105 --> 47:24.625
Where are you?

47:32.949 --> 47:35.310
You wanna play? Let's play.

53:06.850 --> 53:09.124
Hey, Mike.

53:09.787 --> 53:13.788
Mike, I made it. I'm over the cliff.

53:16.058 --> 53:17.962
Mike?

53:18.062 --> 53:21.132
<i>Do you remember our wedding day?</i>

53:21.232 --> 53:24.268
Mike, where are you?

53:24.368 --> 53:29.273
<i>Do you remember we were dancing
on the dance floor to that horrible DJ?</i>

53:29.373 --> 53:34.545
Remember how mad you were at me because
I kept taking videos on my cell phone?

53:35.145 --> 53:37.715
<i>I wanted to take videos because...</i>

53:37.815 --> 53:40.474
<i>I wanted our children to see...</i>

53:40.574 --> 53:43.021
<i>how amazing their mother was...</i>

53:44.221 --> 53:46.891
on that night,

53:46.991 --> 53:49.561
in that dress.

53:50.161 --> 53:52.163
You looked beautiful.

53:52.263 --> 53:56.033
I looked blotchy. Irish skin.

53:56.133 --> 53:59.003
<i>Wit, listen to me.</i>

53:59.103 --> 54:02.206
<i>They're going to find you,
and they're going to kill you.</i>

54:02.306 --> 54:04.743
<i>Unless you kill them first.</i>

54:05.643 --> 54:07.278
Kill...

54:07.378 --> 54:09.125
them...

54:09.225 --> 54:11.402
all.

54:11.881 --> 54:12.899
Mike?

54:13.584 --> 54:16.987
Mike? Please tell me where you are.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.455
Tell me you're okay.

54:18.555 --> 54:22.126
I'm fine, I just need
to take a little nap.

54:22.226 --> 54:24.328
<i>Mike, listen...</i>

54:24.428 --> 54:26.096
<i>you're going into hypovolemic shock.</i>

54:26.196 --> 54:29.634
<i>You need to apply pressure
to stop the hemorrhaging.</i>

54:29.734 --> 54:31.869
I'm just a little tired.

54:31.969 --> 54:35.172
- Mike, please.
- <i>I just need to close my eyes.</i>

54:35.272 --> 54:38.976
Don't, Mike. Don't leave me.

54:39.076 --> 54:42.613
My mother used to sing us lullabies.

54:43.404 --> 54:47.098
The Neary family
is notoriously tone-deaf.

54:50.487 --> 54:53.535
<i>The bear went over the mountain</i>

54:54.032 --> 54:57.439
<i>The bear went over the mountain</i>

54:57.539 --> 55:01.281
<i>The bear went over the mountain</i>

55:03.337 --> 55:05.535
<i>To see what he could see</i>

55:06.788 --> 55:10.206
<i>To see what he could see</i>

55:11.238 --> 55:14.505
<i>To see what he could see</i>

55:15.088 --> 55:18.113
<i>The bear went over the mountain</i>

55:18.213 --> 55:21.597
<i>The bear went over the mountain</i>

55:21.997 --> 55:25.509
<i>The bear went over the mountain</i>

55:26.782 --> 55:29.788
<i>To see what he could...</i>

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:09.589
<i>Well, hey there, little kiddie.</i>

01:10:09.689 --> 01:10:12.292
<i>And welcome to the Little Kiddie Museum.</i>

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.576
<i>I'm Ranger Rowdy,</i>

01:10:14.676 --> 01:10:17.498
<i>and I'll be your tour guide today
to the wonderful forest</i>

01:10:17.598 --> 01:10:20.481
<i>filled with the wonderful animals
we've come to call friends.</i>

01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:25.926
<i>Let's get started. What do you say?</i>

01:10:29.424 --> 01:10:33.596
<i>Here at the County Forest Preservation,
the state's largest nature preserve,</i>

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:37.264
<i>wildlife feels free to run wild.</i>

01:10:43.032 --> 01:10:47.140
<i>The animals kingdom
is filled with different species.</i>

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:57.484
<i>Do you know that some birds of prey
like falcons and owls</i>

01:10:57.584 --> 01:10:59.055
<i>can see in the dark?</i>

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:02.022
<i>How cool is that nature, kids?</i>

01:11:04.392 --> 01:11:09.131
<i>Remember, little kids, the animal kingdom
is not always a nice place.</i>

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:12.902
<i>Some animals are predators,
some animals are prey.</i>

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:16.873
<i>Out there in the wild,
it's survival of the fittest.</i>

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:21.277
<i>America is bountied with beautiful
and varied species...</i>

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:27.216
<i>...we must protect Mother Nature...</i>

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:32.388
<i>..for the birds and the bears,
this is home.</i>

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:35.823
Mi casa es su casa, <i>kiddies.</i>

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:53.809
Hi, Mom. Yeah, I was just about
to call you.

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:56.679
Yeah... no...

01:16:56.779 --> 01:17:00.048
I'm good. Yeah.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:04.654
I know I have soccer practice.
I'll be home in, like, a couple hours.

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:07.657
Because, Mom, Dad was supposed
to give me a ride home from work,

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:11.225
and now I have to ride my bike, so...
yeah, I'm gonna be a little late.

01:17:12.894 --> 01:17:16.399
No, I know. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you worry.

01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:19.656
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

01:17:20.672 --> 01:17:23.539
Yeah. Yeah. I know.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:27.243
I'm just... hanging out with my friends.

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:30.813
Yeah. I'll see you at home soon.

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:32.979
I love you, too.

01:21:09.077 --> 01:21:12.875
