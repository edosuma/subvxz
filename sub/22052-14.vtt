Tristan and I have always
discussed that in August we

09:19.433 --> 09:22.333
would start trying having kids
and I would get off birth

09:22.333 --> 09:24.500
control.
I ended up getting off birth

09:24.500 --> 09:27.633
control a few months before
because I met Dr. Huang.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.467
>> DR. HUANG: There is a
possibility that you being on

09:29.467 --> 09:31.233
the pills as long as you have
has kind of suppressed your

09:31.233 --> 09:33.100
ovaries and not let me see
all the other follicles.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.967
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.
>> DR. HUANG: So get off the

09:34.967 --> 09:37.266
pills.
And if we do that, and, uh,

09:37.266 --> 09:39.767
things look great, awesome.
If things don't look good,

09:39.767 --> 09:42.367
definitely consider getting some
of these maybe in the freezer.

09:42.367 --> 09:44.867
>> KHLOE: Okay.
It's the weirdest, best,

09:44.867 --> 09:48.667
craziest just... .

this, like, just that.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.166
I'm, like, shaking, and he was
like, "What? I can't see

09:58.166 --> 10:00.433
anything."
I was like, " look at

10:00.433 --> 10:02.367
the thing!" He's like, "It says
'poor connection.'"

10:02.367 --> 10:04.767
I was like, "," 'cause
he's in Toronto.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.767

>> KHLOE: So he has no service.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.767

He was like, "Oh, my God."

10:08.767 --> 10:10.834
He's like, "Wait, are you
kidding or serious?"

10:10.834 --> 10:13.133
I was like, "No, I'm serious."
And then I started crying.

10:13.133 --> 10:15.066
He's like, "Are you crying?"
And I was like "I'm crying."

10:15.066 --> 10:17.066

happening."

This is literally her dream,
