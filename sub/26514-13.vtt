00:01.479 --> 00:03.264
Previously onDynasty...Have you checked

00:03.307 --> 00:05.396
your Instagram today?Oh, my God.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.484
Crazily, my accidental
self-love mantra

00:06.528 --> 00:09.009
is trending.So, what,

00:09.052 --> 00:11.098
you're gonna be
an influencer now?To focus on the positive,

00:11.141 --> 00:13.709
I am going to start posting
daily affirmations.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.711
There is no us.
Not anymore.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.234
FALLON: I am definitely
not in good shape.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.496
I need your help, Daddy.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.020
You had one good move

00:20.063 --> 00:21.369
that got you this job, so...

00:21.412 --> 00:23.849
well, I figure I owe
you one of my own.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.503
Oh, hell no.
Oh, hell no.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.070
BLAKE: You just
look so serene

00:27.114 --> 00:28.593
for someone who doesn't know
whose baby they're carrying.

00:28.637 --> 00:30.160
How did you...?The lab called

00:30.204 --> 00:32.075
about your paternity test.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.164
There is no
Mark Jennings in my heart.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.079
TONY: Some guy
named Mark Jennings

00:36.123 --> 00:39.039
could be
the baby daddy.Hello. Is this Mark?

00:52.182 --> 00:54.706
Whoa...Easy.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.186
BLAKE: Looks like
someone's ready

00:56.230 --> 00:58.188
for the triple crown.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.930
Hardly.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.584
I thought I was
gonna give her a workout,

01:02.627 --> 01:04.020
and I'm the one
who's exhausted.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.935
You're sure that's safe
for the baby?

01:05.978 --> 01:08.677
My mother rode horses
when she was pregnant with me,

01:08.720 --> 01:10.287
and I turned out to be fine.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.854
Well, I wouldn't say that.

01:12.855 --> 01:13.856
You turned out perfectly.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.120
Speaking of the baby...

01:17.164 --> 01:19.862
Have you gotten word on
the results from the DNA test?

01:19.905 --> 01:22.038
I don't get them till tomorrow.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.040
But when I do,

01:24.084 --> 01:26.173
have you come around to the idea

01:26.216 --> 01:29.437
that the baby I'm carrying
might not be yours?

01:29.480 --> 01:32.222
I'm not gonna lie,
it's been hard,

01:32.266 --> 01:33.615
but...

01:33.658 --> 01:36.183
not as hard
as a life without you.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.228
I love you, Cristal.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.969
And I've realized that

01:40.012 --> 01:42.841
even if this baby is Mark's,
it's gonna be yours.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.060
A part of you.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.541
And how could I
not love it, too?

01:46.584 --> 01:48.064
So whatever
the results,

01:48.108 --> 01:50.414
I will raise this child
as if it's my own.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.286
Wow.

01:54.418 --> 01:56.420
As long as we keep this
between us.

01:56.464 --> 01:58.292
I need your word

01:58.335 --> 02:02.122
that if it's not mine, we lie...

02:03.427 --> 02:04.515
...and it goes in the vault.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.475
ALEXIS: I don't know
why she lied to you,

02:07.518 --> 02:10.434
but you deserve to know.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.133
Mark, I think it is your baby.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.833
And what makes you
so sure it's mine?

02:17.876 --> 02:20.401
Because I overheard Cristal
talking to Blake about it.

02:20.444 --> 02:23.404
If I am the father, why wouldn't
Cristal talk to me about it?

02:23.447 --> 02:26.189
Clearly you don't know Blake.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.886
He's a very powerful man,

02:27.930 --> 02:29.888
and a jealous one.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.587
I believe that Cristal is afraid
of him, and she's right to be.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.676
I should know.
Cristal and I

02:34.719 --> 02:37.461
have become really good friends
over the past few months,

02:37.505 --> 02:40.421
and it pains me to see
her hurting like this.

02:40.464 --> 02:43.337
And I would intervene myself,
but I'm sure that Blake would

02:43.380 --> 02:44.816
make me pay for it.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.732
So you mustn't let them know

02:47.776 --> 02:50.126
that I have anything
to do with this.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.346
Do you understand?I got it.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.564
Don't worry.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.611
I won't, now that you're here.

02:56.654 --> 03:00.484
Now, life has a way
of working itself out.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.706
FALLON: I mean, I basically
had to spoon-feed Culhane

03:04.749 --> 03:07.317
a simple capital
expenditure report.

03:07.361 --> 03:08.797
A third grader could have
figured it out.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.364
I mean, if you care
about this new venture

03:10.407 --> 03:11.887
as much as you say you do,

03:11.930 --> 03:14.106
I would not let him near it.He managed to stack

03:14.150 --> 03:16.631
our roster with the elite,
hard-to-sign players.

03:16.674 --> 03:20.417
Which is why he's head of player
development, not an accountant.

03:20.461 --> 03:23.028
Okay, but, I mean,
I'm your little girl.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.247
I'm the one
that's gonna

03:24.291 --> 03:27.032
be there for you in the end...
in theory.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.947
Mm-hmm.
I mean,
where's your loyalty?

03:28.991 --> 03:31.254
If you mean professional
loyalty, it's with Culhane.

03:31.298 --> 03:34.083
He cannot be trusted. He lied to
me, he will do the same to you.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.520
You should dump him
before he screws you over.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.827
And you should get used
to working with him.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.482
Or, for him, technically.

03:41.525 --> 03:42.439
He is a co-owner.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.267
You asked for a job,

03:44.311 --> 03:46.530
I made you head of branding,
a critical position.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.315
Yeah, not critical enough
for a clothing allowance

03:48.358 --> 03:49.490
or a corner office.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.232
It's vital we get
the press behind us

03:52.275 --> 03:54.451
so we can build up momentum
heading into the season.

03:54.495 --> 03:57.193
Which is why we need the team
launch to be a success.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.282
Oh, it will be
wildly successful,

03:59.326 --> 04:01.937
because I have the experience
to make it so.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.810
Whereas Culhane...Enough.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.377
Just focus on your job,

04:07.421 --> 04:09.597
and leave your personal life
at home.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.817
♪ Yeah

04:12.861 --> 04:14.341
♪ Let's go,
come get a sneak peek... ♪

04:14.384 --> 04:15.820
Kirbs.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.344
What do you think? Too much?

04:17.387 --> 04:19.563
Is the diamond-studded
cummerbund

04:19.607 --> 04:20.999
crossing a line?KIRBY: No.

04:21.043 --> 04:24.351
But I also think we ran past
that line a while ago.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.178
FALLON:
Dare I ask

04:26.222 --> 04:27.310
what's going on here?

04:27.354 --> 04:28.964
KIRBY:
Smile, Bo.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.316
Uh, he's an influencer now.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.144
Are you sure you two
aren't underthe influence?

04:35.187 --> 04:37.059
I mean, what happened
to your daily affirmations?

04:37.102 --> 04:39.453
Well, I realized that I
shouldn't be affirming anything

04:39.496 --> 04:41.585
for anyone when I barely know
what I'm doing myself.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.848
And this is
you knowing what you're doing?

04:43.892 --> 04:45.415
It's the perfect way
to increase my followers.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.635
Yeah. And that's where
the real money is.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.463
I get five percent.Well...

04:49.506 --> 04:52.248
Would now be a good time
to remind you loons

04:52.292 --> 04:54.294
that Sam is married
to a billionaire?

04:54.337 --> 04:55.686
Well, this isn't
about the money.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.472
It's a chance for me to earn
my place in this family,

04:58.515 --> 05:00.387
to create
my own empire.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.345
I don't want people to think
that I'm some sort of lazy,

05:02.389 --> 05:04.478
hanger-on trophy husband.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.436
No. You're not lazy.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.698
All right, well,

05:07.742 --> 05:10.179
give PETA my best
when they call.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.185
Need the conference room?

05:16.228 --> 05:18.796
Nope, it's okay.
I'll come back later.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.711
Fallon, how long
are you gonna keep this up?

05:20.755 --> 05:22.322
Keep what up?

05:22.365 --> 05:23.932
This. Avoiding me.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.629
There's only so many offices
to hide in around here.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.805
Don't you think
it's time to grow up?

05:27.849 --> 05:30.504
Actually, I think it's time
for you to find your own

05:30.547 --> 05:33.115
family business to ruin and stay
the hell away from mine.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.509
Tell you what,

05:35.552 --> 05:38.599
I'm gonna hit the gym before the
launch meetings this morning.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.514
It's all yours.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.472
Wait.

05:42.516 --> 05:46.389
Since we are stuck together like
the Kardashians are with Kanye,

05:46.433 --> 05:48.391
I will be the bigger person.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.219
Truce?

05:50.262 --> 05:53.353
Truce? I don't have
the issue here.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.745
You do.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.007
Do you think
you can work with me?

05:56.051 --> 05:57.226
I'm a professional.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.749
Besides, we have a history.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.404
We know each other well. It'll
make working together easy.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.971
Perfect fit, really.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.713
Glad you finally see it
that way.

06:05.756 --> 06:07.410
Keep the peace?

06:07.454 --> 06:09.325
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.113
Hmm.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.466
Are things on track
for the team launch tomorrow?

06:19.509 --> 06:22.033
I believe so. As long
as Fallon and Culhane

06:22.077 --> 06:23.644
don't kill each other first.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.907
Well, let's hope the new team
has their same fighting spirit.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.909
If they have half as much,
we'll go undefeated,

06:27.952 --> 06:29.301
I guarantee you.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.781
Oh, my God.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.653
Yeah, Mark Jennings. I'm here
to see Cristal Jennings.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.785
It's Mark.Your ex-husband Mark?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.483
Are you serious?Yeah.

06:36.526 --> 06:37.484
What's he doing here?

06:37.527 --> 06:38.876
I'm not sure.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.182
ANDERS:
Wait here for a moment,

06:40.225 --> 06:41.836
Mr. Jennings,
I'll go and see
if I can find...

06:41.879 --> 06:43.098
JENNINGS:
Mark.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.622
What a surprise.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.363
Cristal.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.538
BLAKE: You must
be Mark Jennings.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.019
Let me guess:
Blake Carrington.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.673
Heard a lot about you.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.675
What brings you to Atlanta?

06:54.718 --> 06:57.460
Just some personal business.

06:57.504 --> 07:00.158
ANDERS: So would you like
me to get the staff to bring

07:00.202 --> 07:01.551
some coffee
into the drawing room?

07:01.595 --> 07:02.596
Unfortunately, we
don't have time.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.511
We were just on our way out.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.034
Hey, I get it. Won't keep you.

07:06.077 --> 07:09.211
But before I go,
I need to talk to Cristal.

07:09.254 --> 07:10.647
Alone.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.270
Mark, what are you doing here?I wanted to see you,

07:25.314 --> 07:26.707
make sure you're okay.

07:29.361 --> 07:30.493
This guy treating you well?

07:30.537 --> 07:31.668
Of course he is.

07:31.712 --> 07:32.713
You sure?

07:32.756 --> 07:34.497
Why the sudden concern?

07:34.541 --> 07:37.152
You used to like it
when I was concerned.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.589
I also used to like
when you sang in the bathtub.

07:39.633 --> 07:40.677
Things change.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.550
Yeah. I'm more
of a shower guy now.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.081
You told me
I wasn't the father.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.909
It's easy to lie
to someone in a text.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.693
Please don't do this.

07:56.737 --> 07:58.347
But I'm hoping

07:58.390 --> 08:00.697
that it's a lot harder for you
to lie to my face.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.525
Mark...

08:05.920 --> 08:08.879
Crissy...

08:08.923 --> 08:10.707
is that our baby?

08:12.970 --> 08:14.581
Rolling.Hey, guys,

08:14.624 --> 08:16.278
it's the real Sammy Jo here,

08:16.321 --> 08:18.715
coming to you live
from the Carrington Manor.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.369
So now that you

08:20.412 --> 08:23.459
are getting to know me, I want
to know what you want to see.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.288
Ooh. Lots of ideas
coming through.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.812
Mostly involving nudity,

08:28.856 --> 08:30.727
or animals.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.208
Or both.
What?

08:33.251 --> 08:34.818
Ew. People are weird.ANDERS:
This, apparently,

08:34.862 --> 08:37.081
was left anonymously at my door.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.909
Am I supposed
to have it dry-cleaned

08:38.953 --> 08:42.304
in case Bo needs it
for his next formal event?

08:42.347 --> 08:45.699
Anders, we're kind of in
the middle of something here.

08:45.742 --> 08:49.529
And yes, he'll need it
for Westminster next week.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.749
Oh, well, at least he won't
be the only one overdressed.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.360
Cut it. Yeah.

08:55.404 --> 08:58.625
Whoa. Lots of comments
about my dad.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.191
"Who's the
savage butler?"

09:00.235 --> 09:02.150
"#ButlerOrBoss"?

09:02.193 --> 09:03.325
"#AndersForever"?

09:03.368 --> 09:05.283
What?

09:05.327 --> 09:07.024
Huh?

09:07.068 --> 09:08.983
Well, the people have spoken.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.595
Welcome to the team,
Joseph Anders.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.598
You look a little out of sorts.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.513
Go away, Alexis.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.778
Who was that handsome man
that I saw enter the manor?

09:21.822 --> 09:23.171
Not that it's any
of your business,

09:23.214 --> 09:24.607
but it's Cristal's
ex-husband.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.087
Mark Jennings?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.438
So is it true?Is what true?

09:29.481 --> 09:32.397
Well, I, um, overheard
some staff scuttlebutt,

09:32.441 --> 09:33.747
and I didn't want to believe it,

09:33.790 --> 09:35.270
but is there some
sort of question

09:35.313 --> 09:37.794
as to the paternity
of Cristal's child?

09:37.838 --> 09:38.969
Just stop right there.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.841
Get your own disastrous life
in order

09:40.884 --> 09:43.452
before you stick your nose
into mine.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.585
I'm so sorry that it has
to end this way.

09:45.628 --> 09:46.760
Excuse me?

09:46.803 --> 09:48.675
Well, obviously,
you can't stay with her

09:48.718 --> 09:49.676
if you're not the father.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.765
I mean, what's
it gonna look like?

09:51.808 --> 09:55.159
"Blake Carrington raises
another man's child"?

09:55.203 --> 09:56.813
Well, it'll look
like the last 30 years.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.120
Isn't that how long you lied to
me about Steven's real father?

09:59.163 --> 10:01.165
That is different.
Is it?

10:01.209 --> 10:02.689
Look what your lies
did to Steven.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.734
He's run off to go find himself
and he hasn't come back.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.127
Who knows if we'll ever
even see him again.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.781
You know what?
Thank you.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.784
Thank you, Alexis.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.351
For once, your constant
invasion of privacy's

10:13.395 --> 10:15.658
been very helpful.
Thank you.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.188
Cristal.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.407
Blake.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.888
We need to talk, Cristal.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.672
I know the truth,
Carrington.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.543
I'm sorry. I had to tell him

10:31.587 --> 10:33.284
there's a chance
he might be the father.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.199
Please don't be upset.

10:35.243 --> 10:38.246
No. I never should've
told you to lie.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.856
Eventually, the truth
would come out,

10:39.900 --> 10:40.857
and then this child
would hate us.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.816
Good call on that.

10:44.513 --> 10:45.862
I owe you an apology.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.168
If this child

10:47.211 --> 10:49.083
turns out to be yours,
we will work out

10:49.126 --> 10:51.259
some sort of amicable
custody arrangement.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.174
You mean that?

10:53.217 --> 10:56.046
Yeah. No more lies
and no more secrets.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.658
That's all I ever wanted.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.529
I appreciate that, Blake.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.271
To prove that I'm sincere,
you are welcome to stay here

11:03.314 --> 11:05.360
at the manor until the test
results come back tomorrow.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.970
Thanks.

11:07.014 --> 11:11.105
I might just take
you up on that.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.802
I can't believe this new Blake

11:12.846 --> 11:14.978
I'm looking at.
This is gonna work out,

11:15.022 --> 11:17.981
even if we have
a blended family,

11:18.025 --> 11:19.722
you'll see.

11:19.766 --> 11:23.465
I have no doubt. Whatever comes
our way, we'll deal with it.

11:25.641 --> 11:26.773
I love you.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.895
What's up, Fallon?

12:01.938 --> 12:04.288
Sup, Kyle. Looking good.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.725
You, too.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.254
Culhane, you're here.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.778
Oh, did-did you think
I'd be late for some reason?

12:15.822 --> 12:18.520
Your trick at the gym
didn't work.

12:18.563 --> 12:21.523
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.439
But you might want to change
the combination on your locker.

12:24.482 --> 12:26.354
You've had the same code
since I've known you.

12:26.397 --> 12:29.400
So much for your truce.
I should've known better.

12:29.444 --> 12:30.793
Yes, you should've.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.795
You think a stunt like that's
gonna work on me?

12:32.839 --> 12:34.405
You're gonna have to try
a little harder.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.668
Oh, really?Where the hell were you?

12:36.712 --> 12:37.931
Right here, waiting for
the morning meeting.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.628
Which was moved up an hour.
You missed it.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.283
What? I...

12:42.326 --> 12:43.806
Look, I didn't know
about the time change.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.460
Okay, there was
a mishap at the gym.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.897
My-my phone, my clothes,
everything was stolen.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.987
Yeah, I don't want your excuses,
I want you at the meeting.

12:51.031 --> 12:54.208
We have one shot at this launch,
it has to go well.

12:56.558 --> 13:00.388
I didn't have an issue with you
before, but I do now.

13:00.431 --> 13:01.824
It's on.

13:01.868 --> 13:05.523
I do love a good challenge.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.841
Hi.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.713
Alexis. Just back
from a swim.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.280
Water's great.
You should take a dip.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.500
You seem to have
gotten quite comfortable

13:25.543 --> 13:27.632
considering you're
behind enemy lines.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.286
Yeah, it didn't go
at all like you said.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.505
Guy was pretty understanding.

13:30.548 --> 13:33.334
Kid turns out to be mine,
we share custody.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.510
Cristal called it a, uh,
a blended family.

13:35.553 --> 13:39.079
Yes, you'll be one big
Benetton ad.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.515
You know,
I just still

13:40.558 --> 13:42.560
can't help but worry.

13:42.604 --> 13:45.215
You know, Blake
and his kind gestures

13:45.259 --> 13:47.348
usually come
with an expiration date.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.872
You think he'll change his mind?He might have

13:49.916 --> 13:53.876
acted like he was understanding,
but, you know, make no mistake,

13:53.920 --> 13:55.269
he will find a way

13:55.312 --> 13:57.271
to banish you from
your child's life.

13:57.314 --> 14:00.143
It's a pain that
I know all too well.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.362
He seemed
pretty genuine.

14:01.405 --> 14:04.756
You sure this has nothing to do

14:04.800 --> 14:06.410
with your own personal grudge
with Blake?

14:08.456 --> 14:10.545
Maybe I should've
told you this earlier--

14:10.588 --> 14:12.895
she is still in love with you.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.592
What?

14:14.636 --> 14:15.855
It's true.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.726
Why wouldn't she
tell me herself?

14:17.769 --> 14:20.207
Because she's terrified
to admit it.

14:20.250 --> 14:23.123
She's afraid that Blake
will retaliate.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.081
And, well, I mean, I would've
told you this earlier,

14:25.125 --> 14:27.257
but I didn't want
to betray her trust,

14:27.301 --> 14:30.434
and quite frankly, I thought
that she'd tell you herself.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.696
Son of a bitch.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.353
Hanson will hand it off to me,

14:36.397 --> 14:38.094
I'll unveil the logo,
then Culhane

14:38.138 --> 14:39.313
will introduce
the player roster.

14:39.356 --> 14:42.098
Oh, which none of us
received, Mr. Culhane.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.970
I hope it didn't slip
through the cracks

14:44.013 --> 14:45.449
due to your busy
gym schedule.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.106
Apologies. I was hoping to close
a deal on one more player

14:50.150 --> 14:51.281
before the launch.
You'll have

14:51.325 --> 14:52.587
a roster list in the morning.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.502
Cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.808
Oh, good point, Bill.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.027
The most important part

14:58.071 --> 15:01.161
of the team launch
is the team, is it not?

15:01.204 --> 15:05.121
I'm on top of it, Fallon,
so just stay in your lane.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.776
The road is your expertise,
isn't it, Mr. Culhane?

15:07.819 --> 15:09.125
It's been brought
to my attention

15:09.169 --> 15:13.173
that you were Mr. Carrington's
driver six months ago?

15:14.783 --> 15:17.090
I've invested millions here.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.092
Why are we leaving
so much up to you?

15:22.834 --> 15:24.924
I was a driver
for Mr. Carrington.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.622
I sat in that
front seat,

15:27.665 --> 15:29.319
listened to every deal
he negotiated.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.973
And that has
helped me

15:31.017 --> 15:33.410
when it came to closing deals
with our players.

15:33.454 --> 15:37.371
And he was pivotal in helping us
sign Sterling Wells to the team.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.329
You see, the easiest
way to increase

15:39.373 --> 15:43.768
our fan base is by
securing star players.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.814
I've put together
a financial outlook

15:45.857 --> 15:47.468
based on our current
player acquisitions.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.035
Each player will have
a different impact

15:49.078 --> 15:50.993
on our economic
and social growth,

15:51.037 --> 15:52.734
which will attract
more broadcasters,

15:52.777 --> 15:54.649
which in turn will
generate more revenue.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.651
That way our GSI
continues to rise,

15:56.694 --> 15:59.175
and we all continue
to make money.

15:59.219 --> 16:01.177
Uh, there's a copy
for you, Billy.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.005
Read that, let me know
if you have any questions.

16:08.315 --> 16:11.100
You haven't eaten much of
your breakfast, have you, hmm?

16:13.146 --> 16:15.626
Ah.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.325
Now I don't want you to get used
to having caviar,

16:18.368 --> 16:20.718
you'll get a feeling
of entitlement.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.372
But you're just a dog.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.114
Yes, you are, even if you have
a very fine tuxedo.

16:25.158 --> 16:26.246
Here, try that.
Free-range...

16:26.289 --> 16:28.030
KIRBY: Oh, my God,
are you seeing this?

16:28.074 --> 16:31.251
I don't know what I'm seeing.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.862
Well, your followers
are all over it.

16:33.905 --> 16:37.213
"#TheDogButler."
"Buckhead or Barkhead."

16:37.257 --> 16:40.303
"The real
Bloodhound Gang."

16:40.347 --> 16:43.828
Oh, my God,
there's already a meme.

16:43.872 --> 16:46.309
I guess this is what
people want to see.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.964
Michael, nice work.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.053
Bill threw you a curveball
and you handled it with ease.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.402
You seriously think

16:52.446 --> 16:54.883
a Louisiana investor
who flew in here for a day

16:54.926 --> 16:57.059
just happened to know that
I used to be your driver?

16:57.103 --> 16:58.365
That curveball
was thrown by Fallon.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.715
E-Excuse me? I had nothing
to do with that.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.064
Please. How long are you
gonna continue with these

17:02.108 --> 17:03.457
childish pranks?
Because I'm here to work.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.373
Oh, as am I. And I'm telling
you, it was not me.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.592
Just like you had nothing to do
with my disappearing clothes?

17:08.636 --> 17:10.464
Oh, please, someone must have...And you took my phone.

17:10.507 --> 17:13.075
Enough!

17:13.119 --> 17:15.556
Whatever's going on with you two
needs to end.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.776
Now, or heads will roll.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.083
I am telling you,
I had nothing

17:21.127 --> 17:22.215
to do with Bill's comments.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.217
Michael, did that
lob work for you?

17:24.260 --> 17:26.132
Like a charm. Thanks, buddy.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.091
Anything to help a fellow
LSU man mark his territory.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.093
Go Tigers.

17:33.139 --> 17:37.230
I'm sorry, you set yourself up
to make it look like I did it?

17:37.273 --> 17:40.015
I admit, I'm not
usually that petty,

17:40.059 --> 17:41.495
but I know you, Fallon.

17:41.538 --> 17:44.672
The only way to get to you
is to stoop to your level.

17:51.679 --> 17:52.854
Ms. Jennings,

17:52.897 --> 17:54.203
I just came
from the stables.

17:54.247 --> 17:57.685
Patches is-is
really acting up.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.382
None of the staff
can calm him down.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.123
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

18:01.167 --> 18:03.952
Probably spooked
by a snake or something.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.041
Look, I hate to ask,

18:06.085 --> 18:08.304
but would you mind going out
and checking on him?

18:08.348 --> 18:10.741
He always seems
to settle down around you.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.048
I'll go check on him.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.186
Well done, Anthony.

18:20.229 --> 18:23.972
I don't like lying.
It makes me uncomfortable.

18:24.015 --> 18:27.149
Well, not as uncomfortable
as you'd be if Blake found out

18:27.193 --> 18:29.282
that you'd switched
the first paternity test.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.501
I knew that'd come back
to bite me in the ass.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.859
Mark?

18:41.903 --> 18:43.339
What are you
doing here?

18:43.383 --> 18:45.254
I can see why you like it here.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.952
And these barns? I mean, I can
fit my entire house in here,

18:47.996 --> 18:49.171
including the backyard.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.781
Your place has
its own charm.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.044
You're being kind, as usual.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.351
Except when you
get on a horse.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.832
You always had to win
when we went racing on the farm.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.268
It's an ugly side to you,
really.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.577
Well, I don't remember you
holding back much either.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.318
Guilty.

19:08.190 --> 19:11.498
I miss those days. I miss you.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.848
They're nice memories,
but they're in the past.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.241
We could create
new memories.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.329
Mark...Cristal,

19:16.372 --> 19:19.462
is it true?

19:19.506 --> 19:21.203
Do you still have
feelings for me?

19:21.247 --> 19:24.293
What? Why would you
think that I...

19:24.337 --> 19:26.556
Don't be mad, Alexis told me.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.256
Alexis? No.
A-Are you kidding me?

19:30.299 --> 19:31.953
Yeah, she's
a real piece of work,

19:31.996 --> 19:33.215
but it doesn't matter
what she said.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.782
All that matters is the answer.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.523
Do you still have
feelings for me?

19:39.265 --> 19:41.005
It doesn't matter
if I have feelings.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.355
We can't be together,
you know that.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.270
It's too dangerous.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.402
Our car accident
was no accident.

19:46.446 --> 19:47.708
My family tore us
apart then,

19:47.751 --> 19:49.405
and they will do it again.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.494
To hell with your family.
Things are different now.

19:51.538 --> 19:54.541
Yeah, they're different.
I moved on.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.107
I had to.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.805
And you should do it as well.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.763
If I thought you were
really happy with this guy,

19:59.807 --> 20:00.982
I would walk away.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.941
But I know you.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.595
I can see it in your eyes.

20:07.293 --> 20:09.033
Is this what you really want?

20:18.652 --> 20:21.220
Must be 7:00 if you're
home from work.

20:23.091 --> 20:25.702
Oh, dear. Well, I'm not
surprised, given the way

20:25.746 --> 20:27.617
they were looking
at each other earlier.

20:27.661 --> 20:30.185
You never really do get over
your first love.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.276
I never did.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.463
Hey, Max?Yeah?

20:47.507 --> 20:49.030
Have the new
players' deals closed?

20:49.073 --> 20:50.814
Not yet. Culhane wanted to see
the final vetting reports.

20:50.858 --> 20:51.989
So who's the front-runner?

20:52.033 --> 20:53.991
Can tell you who
it won't be: PJ Reed.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.819
Talented guy, but we
discovered a drug problem.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.474
Wow. Good catch.
I'm actually on my way

20:58.518 --> 21:01.477
to go see Culhane right now,
so I can hand those off to him.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.349
Great. I put that warning
about PJ Reed right there

21:03.392 --> 21:05.525
on top so he'd see it.Smart thinking.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.483
He can't miss it.

21:14.969 --> 21:16.144
Enjoying your
stay, I hope.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.972
What's not to like?

21:18.015 --> 21:20.366
There was a chocolate candy
on my pillow last night.

21:20.409 --> 21:22.019
By the way, you got
any more of those?

21:22.063 --> 21:23.456
Well, I'll see
what I can do.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.022
In the meantime,

21:25.066 --> 21:27.198
I have an offer for you.

21:27.242 --> 21:30.332
What kind of offer?

21:30.376 --> 21:31.855
Well, you were banned
from professional soccer

21:31.899 --> 21:33.248
for match fixing.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.077
I was framed by Cristal's
family, you know that.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.731
I am in a position
to have that ban lifted.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.125
You could work again
in the sport you love.

21:41.169 --> 21:45.521
What do I have to do in return
for such a generous favor?

21:45.565 --> 21:49.308
Whatever the test results,
you walk away.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.485
I want you out of our lives
for good.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.748
There he is.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.924
I was wondering when
the real Blake Carrington

21:56.967 --> 21:58.142
was going to reveal himself.

21:58.186 --> 21:59.361
I've heard the stories.

21:59.405 --> 22:00.536
I'm not interested
in what you've heard.

22:00.580 --> 22:01.755
I'm interested
in you leaving.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.496
So, what's it gonna
take, Jennings?

22:03.539 --> 22:05.585
You looking for
a payday as well?

22:07.674 --> 22:10.459
You're a fool if you think
there's anything

22:10.503 --> 22:13.462
that you can offer that's gonna
keep me from my kid.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.862
Or from Cristal.

22:31.567 --> 22:36.920
Mack, there's a certain
gentleman staying with me.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.400
As soon as he leaves
the property,

22:38.444 --> 22:40.968
I want you to remind him...

22:41.011 --> 22:43.884
no one crosses Blake Carrington.

22:43.927 --> 22:46.800
Hey, Insta-fam, we are live,

22:46.843 --> 22:49.498
and once again
pulling back the curtain

22:49.542 --> 22:51.152
on the secret life of Anders.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.806
Take a look.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.635
I've finally figured it out,
my canine friend.

22:55.678 --> 22:59.421
You don't like to eat alone.
And nor should you.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.641
I have to keep up an image
with the rest of the staff,

23:01.684 --> 23:04.208
so if you mention
our secret din-dins,

23:04.252 --> 23:06.559
the filet will be returned,

23:06.602 --> 23:08.169
and it's back to the kibble
for you.

23:08.212 --> 23:09.344
Shh.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.476
What are you...?

23:10.519 --> 23:12.521
Can I help you?

23:12.565 --> 23:14.349
#Busted.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.004
Turn that thing off.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.136
It's just for fun, Daddy.It's for my Insta-stories.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.486
For whatever reason,

23:20.529 --> 23:22.183
you're the most interesting
thing in my life.

23:22.226 --> 23:23.576
Well, not anymore.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.491
I'm not having people
manipulate my face

23:25.534 --> 23:27.449
with googly eyes
and devil horns

23:27.493 --> 23:28.798
just for the amusement
of strangers.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.452
That's not what this is.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.323
My fans like my stories
because they're real

23:32.367 --> 23:33.673
and truthful.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.762
No filters and no lies.

23:35.805 --> 23:38.068
And no, thank you.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.069
Are you still recording?

23:39.113 --> 23:40.462
I am sorry,

23:40.506 --> 23:42.769
but I'm shutting
this down.

23:42.812 --> 23:46.686
CROWD:
Three, two, one!

23:49.036 --> 23:53.170
CROWD :
AX! FC! AX! FC!

23:58.785 --> 24:00.743
Thank you, Atlanta.

24:00.787 --> 24:03.311
But what good is a logo

24:03.354 --> 24:04.660
without our star players
wearing it?

24:04.704 --> 24:07.228
So, here to introduce
some of our team members

24:07.271 --> 24:10.231
is head of player development,
Michael Culhane.

24:13.539 --> 24:14.975
Thanks, Blake.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.803
Today, we finalized the
contracts for the three players

24:16.846 --> 24:19.806
around whom we will build
our historic franchise.

24:19.849 --> 24:22.112
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together

24:22.156 --> 24:24.593
for Felipe Sabbaga,
Finn Jordan,

24:24.637 --> 24:26.116
and PJ Reed!

24:35.169 --> 24:37.606
And you can follow them
and all our players on social

24:37.650 --> 24:40.957
as well as AtlantixFC.com.

24:41.001 --> 24:43.003
But right now, I'll be taking
any questions you may have.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.093
Uh... right there
in the front.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.703
Thank you, Ms. Carrington.
Wondering,

24:47.747 --> 24:49.792
what kind of economic impact
do you think the team will have

24:49.836 --> 24:52.403
on the city of Atlanta?Well, I'm glad you asked.

24:52.447 --> 24:55.015
Over half of the labor force
building the stadium

24:55.058 --> 24:56.190
will be from
local neighborhoods,

24:56.233 --> 24:58.975
as well as the staff
during the games.

24:59.019 --> 25:01.717
Atlantix FC is all
about community.

25:01.761 --> 25:02.762
Question for Mr. Culhane.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.723
My sources tell me
that PJ Reed was let go

25:07.767 --> 25:10.117
from his previous team due to
a serious drug problem.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.771
Can you comment on that?

25:11.814 --> 25:13.512
Um, I'm not sure where you're
getting your information,

25:13.555 --> 25:16.558
but PJ...His previous team
covered for him.

25:16.602 --> 25:17.690
Will the Atlantix do the same?

25:17.733 --> 25:20.475
I'm sorry,
these questions...

25:20.519 --> 25:23.434
Are, uh, so relevant
in professional sports today.

25:23.478 --> 25:26.742
You see, painkiller addiction
is a serious issue

25:26.786 --> 25:28.570
among elite athletes

25:28.614 --> 25:30.703
and the Atlantix are aware
of PJ's struggles,

25:30.746 --> 25:31.660
and they fully support

25:31.704 --> 25:33.227
his recovery.
In fact,

25:33.270 --> 25:35.229
the team will be
sponsoring an Atlantix

25:35.272 --> 25:39.320
"kick-the-habit" rehab program
right here in the community.

25:39.363 --> 25:40.495
Any more questions?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.845
Actually, follow-up.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.325
Is there a link between
giving a player like PJ

25:44.368 --> 25:46.545
a second chance,
and Mr. Culhane's

25:46.588 --> 25:49.025
personal experience
with painkiller addiction?

25:51.811 --> 25:55.597
Uh, I'm sorry, today, uh,

25:55.641 --> 25:57.381
today is really about
the Atlantix team,

25:57.425 --> 25:58.644
not the personal
lives of the owners.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.341
As a top football prospect,

26:00.384 --> 26:02.299
Mr. Culhane covered up
his drug problem,

26:02.343 --> 26:04.258
and he's now doing the same
with your players.

26:04.301 --> 26:07.566
Is that the culture we can
expect from this new team?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.611
Okay, that concludes the, uh,

26:09.655 --> 26:11.700
Q and A portion
of our event today.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.702
Thank you so much.AX!

26:13.746 --> 26:15.138
FC!

26:15.182 --> 26:17.097
CROWD :
AX! FC!

26:17.140 --> 26:19.490
AX! FC!

26:21.710 --> 26:22.885
Start talking, now.

26:22.929 --> 26:23.799
They were prescribed drugs

26:23.843 --> 26:25.105
by team doctors after my injury.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.933
That's your business.
I'm talking about mine.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.587
How did you miss
PJ's drug problem?

26:28.630 --> 26:30.414
I don't know.
He was fully vetted.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.809
There were no red flags
in the report.

26:33.853 --> 26:36.769
Unless someone didn't give me
the entire report.

26:36.812 --> 26:39.162
Oh, I'm sorry, I think
you mean "thank you

26:39.206 --> 26:40.816
for stepping up and saving
this team's reputation."

26:40.860 --> 26:43.210
Fallon, is this true?

26:43.253 --> 26:45.778
No. No.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.823
Well, I mean, not entirely.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.130
You know the worst part?

26:50.173 --> 26:51.784
You used something
I told you in confidence

26:51.827 --> 26:54.308
at a time when
I cared about you,

26:54.351 --> 26:55.701
and I thought
you cared about me.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.268
Hey, I admit that I gave you
a partial report on PJ,

26:58.312 --> 26:59.618
but I mean,
I didn't know that

26:59.661 --> 27:00.793
Lois Lane was
gonna do a deep dive

27:00.836 --> 27:01.924
into your personal history.

27:01.968 --> 27:04.666
You know what? I'm
done with your lies,

27:04.710 --> 27:06.102
and I'm done with you.

27:06.146 --> 27:09.149
Look, Daddy, I swear...I've heard enough.

27:09.192 --> 27:12.456
Fallon, your petty jealousy has
put this team at risk

27:12.500 --> 27:14.284
and personally damaged
Culhane's reputation.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.200
You're fired.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.342
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

27:28.385 --> 27:31.867
You won't believe
the afternoon that I had.

27:31.911 --> 27:35.828
Exhausted from a day
full of bribery, no doubt.

27:35.871 --> 27:37.786
How could you pressure
Mark to leave town?

27:39.701 --> 27:40.659
I was just trying...

27:40.702 --> 27:41.834
Whatever you were trying to do,

27:41.877 --> 27:43.313
you did it without
discussing it with me.

27:43.357 --> 27:46.665
Blake, we promised,
no more lies between us.

27:46.708 --> 27:47.927
And then you go
behind my back

27:47.970 --> 27:49.232
and do something like that?

27:49.276 --> 27:51.844
Is this what our marriage
is gonna be like?

27:51.887 --> 27:54.020
You're right.
I'm sorry.

27:54.063 --> 27:57.327
I-I saw you and Mark at the
stables, and I got jealous.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.242
I was worried that
I was losing you.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.854
Keep it up and you just might.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.420
You know, lies are the reason
I stopped talking

28:03.464 --> 28:04.944
to my own family.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.380
I won't let history
repeat itself.

28:06.423 --> 28:07.511
I won't stand for that.

28:07.555 --> 28:08.904
Because you're such
a pillar of honesty?

28:08.948 --> 28:11.907
If memory serves, you were
the one that lied first.

28:11.951 --> 28:13.387
You were trying to keep
this whole thing a secret.

28:13.430 --> 28:15.171
I already explained everything.

28:15.215 --> 28:16.869
And if I hadn't
found out by accident,

28:16.912 --> 28:18.348
you'd probably still be
lying to me.

28:18.392 --> 28:20.002
You're upset with me
for lying?

28:20.046 --> 28:22.135
Seems to me there's
plenty of lies to go around.

28:29.838 --> 28:32.536
Oh, sorry.
This is usually

28:32.580 --> 28:34.103
mymoping spot.

28:34.147 --> 28:37.193
I'd use the study, but I'd
rather not run into my father.

28:37.237 --> 28:40.196
Don't worry, he left.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.024
We had a fight.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.812
I may be the one responsible
for putting him in a foul mood.

28:46.855 --> 28:49.902
I sort of sabotaged
our team launch,

28:49.945 --> 28:51.251
due to my own ego,

28:51.294 --> 28:52.905
while destroying
Culhane's reputation

28:52.948 --> 28:54.820
in the process.Wow.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.082
What can I say?
I'm a multitasker.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.345
Oh, you might win,
but not by much.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.695
Still got the baby-daddy blues?Ugh.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.784
Well, I'm sure Blake didn't mean
whatever stupid thing he said.

29:02.828 --> 29:05.308
That's just it.
Everything he said is true.

29:05.352 --> 29:08.311
And the worst part is, the
person we should be angry with

29:08.355 --> 29:09.922
is Alexis.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.532
Recurring theme
in our family.

29:11.575 --> 29:14.230
She used Mark like a pawn,
feeding him with lies

29:14.274 --> 29:15.579
to further her own agenda,

29:15.623 --> 29:17.930
which is, of course,
getting me out of this house.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.106
Wow, that's really awful.

29:20.149 --> 29:21.585
She would do anything
to get what she wants,

29:21.629 --> 29:24.110
and she doesn't care who
she hurts in the process.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.111
Uh-huh.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.808
She's a petty,
manipulative person

29:26.852 --> 29:29.637
who only thinks about herself.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.119
Oh, no.
I'm-I'm sorry.

29:33.162 --> 29:36.296
Fallon, I'm so sorry.
She's your mother.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.864
I shouldn't talk like this.No, it's not that.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.822
It's just that everything
you're saying is describing me.

29:40.866 --> 29:43.042
No. Don't be silly.

29:43.085 --> 29:45.000
No, it's true, I am
turning into my mother.

29:45.044 --> 29:48.090
I am gonna end up old
and alone and surrounded

29:48.134 --> 29:49.744
by paintings of dogs.No, no.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.006
You're nothing like her.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.486
For starters, you just
admitted you were wrong,

29:52.529 --> 29:54.096
and she would never
do something like that.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.968
Good point.

29:56.011 --> 29:59.798
And she would never, ever
apologize and make things right.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.496
Something you can still do.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.150
You think so?

30:04.193 --> 30:06.543
Yes, I do.

30:06.587 --> 30:09.111
Come here.

30:09.155 --> 30:10.634
God, where have you been
all my life?

30:10.678 --> 30:12.114
I bet I wouldn't even
be in this situation

30:12.158 --> 30:14.334
if I had a decent mother
like you growing up.

30:21.254 --> 30:22.559
I know,

30:22.603 --> 30:24.997
I am the last person
you want to see right now,

30:25.040 --> 30:27.347
and you have every right to
slam the door in my face,

30:27.390 --> 30:29.566
but...

30:29.610 --> 30:31.220
I come with a peace offering.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.918
Dry-cleaned.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.833
Even the shoes.

30:34.876 --> 30:37.357
Okay, look, please, Michael,
can I just have five minutes?

30:41.622 --> 30:44.712
Are you sure?

30:44.755 --> 30:47.889
Yeah, yeah,
I-I totally understand.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.413
Okay, well, thanks for calling.

30:50.457 --> 30:52.198
Bye.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.113
Can I help you, Alexis?

30:54.156 --> 30:55.462
Oh, just picking up
some fresh towels.

30:55.505 --> 30:56.593
Or were you looking for Mark?

30:56.637 --> 30:59.074
Why on earth would I be looking

30:59.118 --> 31:00.336
for one of your castoffs, dear?

31:00.380 --> 31:02.251
To see if your scheme
is working.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.775
You know, the one where you
bring Mark to Atlanta,

31:04.819 --> 31:06.821
hoping to drive Blake
and me apart.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.997
Poor, pathetic Cristal.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.304
You are as delusional
about me

31:11.347 --> 31:13.959
as you are about
your place in this manor.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.352
I'm not the one pretending
to need towels.

31:16.396 --> 31:20.139
Allow me to explain.

31:20.182 --> 31:23.098
You came here as
a temporary rebound for Blake.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.187
So that baby you're carrying

31:25.231 --> 31:27.668
is the only thing
that tethers you to him.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.278
He will do the honorable thing
and marry you,

31:29.322 --> 31:30.932
but without that baby,

31:30.976 --> 31:32.978
well, you mean nothing to him.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.588
So, if it proves to be Mark's,
it'll be...

31:34.631 --> 31:36.982
sayonara mamacita.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.071
Interesting theory.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.855
Of course, I see it differently.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.814
Blake and I are very,
very much in love.

31:43.858 --> 31:46.295
And were long before
I knew I was pregnant.

31:46.339 --> 31:48.123
That's what binds us.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.691
That and our unborn child.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.301
That's right.

31:52.345 --> 31:53.955
Did I forget to mention?

31:53.999 --> 31:55.957
I just got off the phone
with my doctor.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.350
Blake is the father of my baby.

31:57.393 --> 32:00.005
We're having a boy.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.571
Another Carrington heir.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.401
Congratulations.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.099
Not that it's all
that special.

32:07.142 --> 32:10.841
I mean, even worms
can procreate.

32:12.365 --> 32:13.409
It's pathetic
watching you hold on

32:13.453 --> 32:15.194
to your old life
long after it ended.

32:15.237 --> 32:18.284
Your family is
done with you.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.981
Steven left the country
to get away from you.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.504
Fallon fears turning into you.

32:21.548 --> 32:24.333
And Blake, Blake
only pities you.

32:24.377 --> 32:26.945
Your time at the manor is over.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.164
And the saddest part...

32:29.208 --> 32:30.949
is you know it.

32:35.910 --> 32:39.653
And despite everything
that has happened between us,

32:39.696 --> 32:41.220
I would never betray what we had

32:41.263 --> 32:42.525
by telling someone
about your past.

32:42.569 --> 32:43.918
You may not
have told the reporter,

32:43.962 --> 32:45.398
but you opened the door
for her to dig deeper.

32:45.441 --> 32:46.660
You're right.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.140
And for that, I
am deeply sorry.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.141
But you have
to believe me.

32:49.184 --> 32:50.620
I would never do
that on purpose.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.231
Truth is...

32:52.274 --> 32:54.668
that reporter could have
talked to any of my old coaches

32:54.711 --> 32:56.278
and dug up my past and...

32:56.322 --> 32:58.237
I shouldn't have went after you
at the office.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.890
But I was hurt.

32:59.934 --> 33:01.457
So I started
playing your game

33:01.501 --> 33:03.024
hoping I could
hurt you back.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.592
I deserved it; I felt like
I couldn't trust you anymore

33:05.635 --> 33:07.115
and so I lashed out.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.857
I guess we both made some
pretty bad decisions lately.

33:11.772 --> 33:15.036
Starting with my decision
to work with Ada Stone.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.124
Yeah,
I'm still waiting

33:16.168 --> 33:18.344
on an apology
for that one, by the way.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.346
You do know that I have
nothing to apologize for, right?

33:20.389 --> 33:22.565
Uh, other than the fact
that Monica was hurt,

33:22.609 --> 33:24.176
Jeff was shot
and you lied to me

33:24.219 --> 33:26.700
again and again?For the millionth time,

33:26.743 --> 33:28.180
I was protecting you.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.746
Meanwhile, you were out
chasing Liam around

33:29.790 --> 33:32.401
like a lost puppy.Oh, no. I did that for us.

33:32.445 --> 33:33.446
In the beginning.

33:33.489 --> 33:36.275
Besides, you chose
to work for Ada.

33:36.318 --> 33:37.754
You saw a get-rich-quick
opportunity.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.887
And you jumped at it.Now this is about money?

33:39.930 --> 33:41.367
Why does it always come back
to money

33:41.410 --> 33:43.064
with the Carringtons?Because money has always been

33:43.108 --> 33:44.935
the root of all of our problems.Always?

33:44.979 --> 33:46.981
Yeah, basically. I can't
remember a time when it wasn't.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.504
I wish I could.
I wish I could go back

33:48.548 --> 33:50.724
to a time when everything was
not so damn complicated.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.033
I mean, I wish I could
go back to when we were good.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.469
Why can't we go back?

34:08.481 --> 34:12.093
♪ I guess you're
just what I needed ♪

34:12.137 --> 34:15.183
♪ Just what I needed♪

34:15.227 --> 34:19.318
♪ I needed someone to feed

34:21.624 --> 34:24.540
♪ I needed someone to bleed.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.595
You okay?

34:35.638 --> 34:38.467
Yeah, I'm okay.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.628
Unless you have a round
of cookies up your sleeve,

35:08.671 --> 35:10.499
just let me wallow here
in peace.

35:10.543 --> 35:14.329
Well, according to the poll
your followers took,

35:14.373 --> 35:17.463
wallowing is
your second-worst look, so...

35:17.506 --> 35:20.205
One more reason for them
to leave me, then.

35:20.248 --> 35:21.858
Not all of them.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.905
One fan who hasn't abandoned you
has left you a video message.

35:24.948 --> 35:27.473
And I think you should watch it.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.739
Fine.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.567
But it better have
adorable puppies in it.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.484
ANDERS:
Greetings to social media.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.573
You may know me as
The Dog Butler.

35:40.616 --> 35:44.185
Or the "Savage Butler"
as my OG fans call me.

35:44.229 --> 35:47.580
But as usual, the Internet
only tells half the truth.

35:47.623 --> 35:50.365
You see, over the last year,
I have developed

35:50.409 --> 35:53.673
quite a soft spot for
"the real Sammy Jo."

35:53.716 --> 35:55.196
Technically, he's married
to my son.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.806
But even if that
weren't the case,

35:56.850 --> 35:58.895
I'd still consider him
to be family.

35:58.939 --> 36:00.680
And that being the case,
I think it's time

36:00.723 --> 36:02.551
he started to call me Dad.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.773
Or #Dad if that better suits
you millennials.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.343
I can't believe he did that.

36:11.386 --> 36:12.735
You think it'll go viral?

36:19.829 --> 36:22.615
This is the most thoughtful
thing you ever said to me.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.879
Well, feel free to post it on
TheRealSammyJo if you'd like.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.446
No.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.667
I'm going to keep this one
for myself.

36:33.103 --> 36:35.497
Some things
aren't meant to be shared.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.632
I'm glad
you're in my life, Anders.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.460
And you in mine.

36:42.939 --> 36:44.202
#Blessed.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.768
No.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.422
No one says that anymore.

36:48.467 --> 36:49.685
Oh.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.691
Hey, I was thinking
I should probably

36:55.735 --> 36:59.304
crash at a hotel until
the test results come in.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.131
Unless you already
got the results.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.005
I'm not the dad, am I?

37:05.048 --> 37:07.050
No.

37:08.530 --> 37:09.662
I'm so sorry.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.229
It's Blake's baby.

37:11.272 --> 37:12.708
Didn't realize how much

37:12.752 --> 37:14.275
I was hoping
for a different ending.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.018
But one thing's for sure.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.716
You're gonna be a great mother.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.762
Oh, Mark.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.765
One day... you'll
make a great dad.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.510
Well, I should
get going.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.773
It's good
to see you again, Cristal.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.732
Mark.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.258
Before you go...

37:42.303 --> 37:44.827
...how about one last ride?

37:44.871 --> 37:46.655
For old times' sake?

37:57.362 --> 38:00.278
I see that you're indulging
in your favorite pastime.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.673
In the interest of keeping the
cleaning staff on schedule,

38:04.717 --> 38:06.066
is there any chance
you might move

38:06.109 --> 38:09.417
your alcohol-induced
hibernation elsewhere?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.506
Like the loft?

38:11.550 --> 38:13.378
Or Iceland.

38:17.077 --> 38:18.818
Alexis.

38:18.861 --> 38:20.907
Please grace us
with your departure.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.782
You're right, Anders.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.917
It is time for me to go.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.072
Mack, hi.

38:56.116 --> 38:59.772
What we talked about earlier
is no longer necessary.

38:59.815 --> 39:02.731
Let's just abort mission,
all right?

39:02.775 --> 39:05.734
Let me know
you got this message ASAP.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.134
I hate to slut-shame, but...

39:14.177 --> 39:16.092
this looks a lot
like you just got back

39:16.136 --> 39:18.921
from some daytime debauchery.I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.620
Okay, fine.
Shut up, leave me alone.

39:21.663 --> 39:22.708
Never.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.536
Where were you?Just out.

39:24.579 --> 39:27.539
Repeating my mistakes,
wondering if I'll ever learn.

39:27.582 --> 39:30.803
And if you post that, I will
shred every fanny pack you own.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.152
Oh, relax.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.502
I'm putting the, uh,
influencer thing on hold.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.765
Why? Too many
requests for eggplant?

39:36.809 --> 39:38.985
No. Well, yes.

39:39.028 --> 39:41.857
But, turns out
it wasn't about me proving

39:41.901 --> 39:44.425
that I'm not a...
trophy husband.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.427
I was just
trying to find a...

39:46.471 --> 39:48.951
way to belong here
without Steven.

39:53.565 --> 39:54.914
Oh, my God.
It's Steven.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.438
Aw...
Must be a sign
from the universe. Hey.

39:57.482 --> 39:58.831
STEVEN:
Sam, thank God. I need...

39:58.874 --> 40:00.789
...soon as you can.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.791
Steven? Can you hear me?
You're breaking up.

40:02.835 --> 40:04.576
I need help. I was mugged...

40:04.619 --> 40:06.752
...no passport,
I have no credit card.Oh, my God, are you okay?

40:06.795 --> 40:08.231
What happened?He got mugged.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.103
Steven, we're coming
to Paraguay to get you, okay?

40:10.146 --> 40:12.235
No, I'm not in Paraguay anymore.
I'm in...

40:12.279 --> 40:13.889
Steven.

40:13.933 --> 40:15.761
Steven, can you hear me?

40:19.808 --> 40:21.810

a mistake, do you?What's that?

41:32.315 --> 41:33.839
I said, do you think

41:33.882 --> 41:35.275
