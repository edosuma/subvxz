AN END BUT RATHER A BEGINNING,

01:24.250 --> 01:26.250
IS HE KIDDING?

01:35.750 --> 01:37.041
(indistinct conversations)

01:37.083 --> 01:39.417
I AM SO GLAD
YOU GUYS ARE HERE.

01:39.458 --> 01:40.542
AND THANK YOU FOR HOSTING.

01:40.583 --> 01:42.083
OH, OF COURSE.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.041
I WOULD'VE DONE IT AT MY PLACE,
BUT, UH,

01:44.083 --> 01:46.291
THE REALTOR HAS A BUNCH OF
PEOPLE LINED UP TO SEE THE HOUSE

01:46.333 --> 01:47.917
SINCE I DROPPED THE PRICE, SO...

01:47.959 --> 01:50.083
YEAH, SHOULD YOU... I MEAN,
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA

01:50.125 --> 01:51.709
JUST, YOU KNOW... TAKE A MINUTE

01:51.750 --> 01:53.417
BEFORE YOU MAKE, UH,
ANY BIG CHANGES?

01:53.458 --> 01:54.667
I MEAN, JUST TAKE A SECOND
TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

01:54.709 --> 01:57.041
NO, NO, NO. LUCAS AND I NEED
TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.542
AND I'M GONNA LOOK AT SOME
HOUSES TOMORROW, SO...

02:00.583 --> 02:03.125
(indistinct conversations
continue)

02:03.166 --> 02:04.291
WELL...
IT'S A GOOD TURNOUT.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.667
YEAH.
YES.

02:05.709 --> 02:06.917
YEAH.
YEAH.

02:06.959 --> 02:09.333
I THINK PETE WOULD'VE
LIKED IT.

02:09.375 --> 02:12.917
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS, RIGHT?
(chuckles)

02:12.959 --> 02:15.500
(singsongy) THIS IS WHAT
THE WILL SAID HE WANTED.

02:15.542 --> 02:18.667
(normal voice) YEAH, HE WENT TO
A FUNERAL ONCE IN BALI, I GUESS,

02:18.709 --> 02:20.166
AND THE WHOLE VILLAGE
CAME OUT TO CELEBRATE.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.375
YOU KNOW, LIKE, DRESSED UP
LIKE IT WAS A PARTY,

02:22.417 --> 02:24.041
TOLD STORIES AND SANG AND...

02:24.083 --> 02:25.959
WAIT, WAIT.
ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO SING?

02:26.041 --> 02:28.041
THE--HE DID REQUEST SINGING,
YES.
(Addison) MM-HMM.

02:28.083 --> 02:29.125
MM-HMM.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
THE KARAOKE MACHINE.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.750
PERHAPS YOU COULD
GET IT STARTED?

02:30.792 --> 02:33.375
OHH. RIGHT.
I'M GONNA NEED A FEW DRINKS.
(laughs)

02:33.417 --> 02:34.625
YES.
WOULD YOU LIKE ONE?

02:34.667 --> 02:37.041
NO. NO, NO, BUT I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.208
UH... YEAH.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.959
UM...
(sets down bag)

02:43.625 --> 02:46.166
PETE GOT THIS IN INDIA
A FEW YEARS AGO.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.917
HE WAS, UH, THERE WORKING
WITH A SPIRITUAL LEADER

02:47.959 --> 02:50.417
WHO--WHO HUGS PEOPLE.
THAT'S HER THING.

02:50.458 --> 02:52.333
SHE'S HUGGED, LIKE,
30 MILLION FOLLOWERS.

02:52.375 --> 02:53.500
SHE MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

02:53.542 --> 02:55.500
AND THIS..

02:55.542 --> 02:57.959
IS FOR YOU.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.041
OH.
(sighs) WEAR IT IN GOOD HEALTH.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.000
(leather rustling)

03:07.792 --> 03:10.000
I'LL BE--I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.166
OH. HE WOKE UP?

03:13.208 --> 03:15.750
YEAH, HE WAS JUST HANGING OUT
IN HIS CRIB, GUMMIN' A RATTLE.

03:15.792 --> 03:17.250
AW. DOES HE NEED
HIS DIAPER CHANGED?

03:17.291 --> 03:18.625
UH, ALREADY TOOK CARE OF IT.

03:18.667 --> 03:21.041
(Henry fusses)
OHH. GOOD.
DOES THAT FEEL GOOD?

03:21.083 --> 03:22.834
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
VIOLET WOULD BE SAD.

03:22.875 --> 03:24.125
SHE IS SAD.

03:24.166 --> 03:27.458
THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
TO HONOR SOMEONE'S MEMORY.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.750
YEAH, BUT... THIS IS WEIRD.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.041
YEAH.

03:31.083 --> 03:34.041
I MEAN, NOT AS WEIRD
AS WATCHING THE CREMATION.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.667
AND THE KIDS COULDN'T
BE MORE BORED.

03:35.709 --> 03:37.458
WHY DON'T I TAKE THEM
TO YOUR PLACE FOR A WHILE?

03:37.500 --> 03:38.875
I DON'T DO TOO WELL

03:38.917 --> 03:41.041
IN SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE
ARE FEELING ONE WAY

03:41.083 --> 03:42.458
AND PRETENDING TO FEEL ANOTHER.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.375
I TEND TO SAY
INAPPROPRIATE THINGS.

03:44.417 --> 03:45.583
AND SHOOT UP.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.000
SO...

03:48.041 --> 03:49.083
IF ANYBODY HAS ANY DRUGS...

03:49.125 --> 03:51.083
OKAY, YEAH. (chuckles)
TOLD YOU.

03:51.125 --> 03:52.667
INAPPROPRIATE THINGS.
YEAH, GO--GO TAKE 'EM.

03:52.709 --> 03:53.875
ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST GONNA GET
HENRY'S BOTTLE.

03:53.917 --> 03:58.000
(sighs) KARAOKE? FOR REAL?
(groans and mutters)

04:02.083 --> 04:04.667
SO THEN I JOINED
THIS RUNNING GROUP,

04:04.709 --> 04:07.834
FIGURING THAT WOULD BE A GREAT
WAY TO MEET PEOPLE, BUT...

04:07.875 --> 04:09.041
BUT?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.792
UM, I LOOK AROUND AND...

04:11.834 --> 04:14.333
AND I SEE ALL THESE PEOPLE--

04:14.375 --> 04:16.917
AT WORK, IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:16.959 --> 04:19.291
I MEAN, THEY JUST...

04:19.333 --> 04:22.417
I--THEY JUST SEEM LIKE
AVERAGE JOES,

04:22.458 --> 04:23.625
YOU KNOW?
YEAH.

04:23.667 --> 04:24.834
THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE
SUPERPOWERS

04:24.875 --> 04:26.041
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.500
BUT, UM, THEY'RE HAPPY.

04:29.542 --> 04:30.750
AND I THINK,

04:30.792 --> 04:33.291
HOW DO THEY DO IT,
YOU KNOW?

04:33.333 --> 04:35.208
WHAT'S THE SECRET?

04:35.250 --> 04:36.667
WELL, THERE'S NO SECRET,
NICK.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.291
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE
MORE NATURALLY DISPOSED TO HAVE

04:38.333 --> 04:40.208
A POSITIVE OUTLOOK.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.333
BUT HAPPINESS CAN
ALSO BE DERIVED

04:42.375 --> 04:43.959
FROM INTENTIONAL ACTIVITIES,
YOU KNOW,

04:44.000 --> 04:47.250
VOLUNTEERING AND MAINTAINING
CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS.

04:47.291 --> 04:50.542
WELL, THAT'S EASIER SAID
THAN DONE.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.041
OKAY, THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD
PLACE TO START OUR NEXT SESSION.

04:56.083 --> 04:57.291
(inhales deeply) OH, SORRY.

04:57.333 --> 05:00.458
I'M, UH, I'M NOT GONNA
BE HERE NEXT WEEK.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.583
OKAY. NO PROBLEM.
WE CAN RESCHEDULE.

05:01.625 --> 05:04.041
ACTUALLY, WE CAN'T.

05:04.083 --> 05:06.000
I CAME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.959
I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF.

05:13.542 --> 05:16.542
(indistinct conversations)

05:20.333 --> 05:22.417
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT
MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER?

05:22.458 --> 05:27.000
IS IF THEY KNEW THERE WAS
A TRIO OF COOPLETS ON THE WAY.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.834
IF YOU WANNA KEEP THOSE HANDS,
GET 'EM OFF MY UTERUS.

05:29.875 --> 05:31.041
(inhales sharply)

05:31.083 --> 05:34.041
(indistinct conversations
continue)

05:35.375 --> 05:36.917
HMM.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.750
IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU'VE GOT AN APPETITE.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.291
(exhales)
WHAT I'VE GOT IS A TAPEWORM.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.500
THREE OF 'EM, ACTUALLY.

05:42.542 --> 05:43.709
COME ON, CHARLOTTE.

05:43.750 --> 05:44.959
ISN'T IT AT LEAST
A LITTLE BIT FUN

05:45.000 --> 05:47.500
TO BE ABLE TO EAT
WHATEVER YOU WANT?

05:47.542 --> 05:49.583
NO. IT'S NOT FUN.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.834
IT'S DISGUSTING.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.208
(lowered voice)
I'M HAVING A LITTER

05:53.250 --> 05:54.959
LIKE SOME KIND OF ANIMAL.

05:55.041 --> 05:56.041
OH. (chuckles)

05:56.083 --> 05:57.417
THESE BLOODSUCKING TICKS

05:57.458 --> 05:59.333
GROWING INSIDE OF ME
HAVE TAKEN OVER MY BODY,

05:59.375 --> 06:00.542
SO I'M JUST A HOST NOW.

06:00.583 --> 06:01.875
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.333
THESE ARE THE SALAD DAYS BEFORE
I START WADDLING AROUND

06:04.375 --> 06:07.959
WITH A VERITABLE
"WIDE LOAD" SIGN ACROSS MY GUT.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.125
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

06:09.166 --> 06:10.667
IS GONNA BE CRISSCROSSED
WITH SO MANY STRETCH MARKS

06:10.709 --> 06:13.250
IT'LL LOOK LIKE A TOPO MAP
OF YELLOWSTONE.

06:13.291 --> 06:16.458
I MEAN,
A MIRACLE PREGNANCY, MY ASS.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.792
MY BIG, FAT,
EVER-EXPANDING ASS.

06:19.834 --> 06:23.208
THE CAR KEPT STALLING OUT.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.041
JANIE AND I, WE WERE SAVING
EVERY CENT WE HAD FOR THE BABY,

06:26.083 --> 06:28.041
SO I PUT OFF
GETTING A TUNE-UP.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.041
BY THE TIME
WE GOT TO THE HOSPITAL,

06:30.083 --> 06:31.709
THE BABY WAS ALREADY
COMING OUT.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.625
I WAS SO RATTLED, I CRASHED INTO
THE AMBULANCE BAY.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.083
(laughs)

06:36.125 --> 06:37.291
YEAH, BUT DR. WILDER--

06:37.333 --> 06:39.291
HE ACTED LIKE HE SAW
THAT KIND OF THING EVERY DAY.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.166
HE SMILED AT JANIE,

06:41.208 --> 06:45.041
TOLD HER SHE'D HAVE
A GREAT STORY TO TELL OUR KID,

06:45.083 --> 06:47.041
AND DELIVERED OUR LITTLE MAYA
RIGHT THERE.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.583
(woman crying)
YOUR HUSBAND...

06:49.625 --> 06:54.041
HE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE
IN MY FAMILY'S LIFE.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.458
HE WAS THERE FOR US
WHEN WE NEEDED HIM.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.667
AND NOT JUST...

06:58.709 --> 07:02.041
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.709
(crying)

07:03.750 --> 07:07.041
I CALLED HIM, YOU KNOW,
THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.834
HE SOUNDED RELAXED.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.500
I WOULD'VE BEEN...

07:11.542 --> 07:13.750
SCARED AS HELL OF THAT TRIAL,
BUT...

07:13.792 --> 07:15.083
MM.

07:15.125 --> 07:18.458
PETE KEPT ON CRACKING JOKES.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.709
IF I HAD KNOWN IT WAS GONNA BE
THE LAST CONVERSATION

07:20.750 --> 07:23.959
I EVER WAS GONNA HAVE
WITH HIM...

07:24.000 --> 07:26.208
I DON'T KNOW.
I WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING ELSE.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.000
HE KNEW HE HAD YOUR SUPPORT.
I'M SURE THAT MEANT A LOT.

07:30.542 --> 07:34.041
HE DESERVED BETTER
THAN DYING IN A DITCH.

07:34.083 --> 07:37.041
I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS, BUT...

07:37.083 --> 07:38.583
YOU KNOW, ANYTHING YOU NEED,
ANYTHING.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.041
I MEAN, YOU NEED ME TO STAY
AT THE HOUSE,

07:40.083 --> 07:41.542
YOU NEED US TO TAKE LUCAS,
WE CAN DO IT.

07:41.583 --> 07:45.166
I-I NEVER KNEW THAT... PETE
WANTED THIS KIND OF CELEBRATION

07:45.208 --> 07:46.375
UNTIL I READ HIS WILL.

07:46.417 --> 07:49.542
I MEAN,
BESIDES ONE CONVERSATION

07:49.583 --> 07:51.041
WHERE HE SAID HE WANTED
TO BE CREMATED,

07:51.083 --> 07:52.542
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT DEATH,

07:52.583 --> 07:54.291
AND WE SHOULD'VE
TALKED ABOUT IT.

07:54.333 --> 07:55.291
IT'S A CONVERSATION
MOST PEOPLE PUT OFF.

07:55.333 --> 07:56.792
MAYBE.

07:56.834 --> 08:00.709
BUT I'M A SINGLE PARENT NOW,
SO I HAVE TO BE PREPARED.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.041
IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF YOU COULD TAKE LUCAS.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.709
SURE. NO PROBLEM.
WE CAN TAKE HIM TONIGHT.

08:05.750 --> 08:08.625
NO, I MEAN, IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME,

08:08.667 --> 08:10.083
I WANT YOU TO BE
HIS GUARDIAN.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.375
OH.

08:12.417 --> 08:15.125
WOW.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.208
WOW. YOU--
I KNOW--

08:19.250 --> 08:20.709
I KNOW IT'S A LOT
TO ASK FOR, BUT--BUT--

08:20.750 --> 08:22.083
BUT THEY--THEY--
THEY GET ALONG GREAT.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.792
AND--AND DON'T YOU THINK
MASON WOULD BE HAPPY

08:23.834 --> 08:25.917
TO HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER?
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.083
THEY COULD SHARE A ROOM

08:27.125 --> 08:29.041
OR YOU COULD LIVE AT MY HOUSE,
WHEREVER THAT WOULD BE.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.500
OH. VIOLET, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:30.542 --> 08:33.500
I DON'T WANNA THINK ABOUT
YOU BEING DEAD. NOT TODAY.

08:33.542 --> 08:35.709
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT.
I NEED YOU TO THINK ABOUT IT.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.917
OKAY?

08:36.959 --> 08:38.709
AND TALK TO CHARLOTTE.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.375
OKAY?

08:40.417 --> 08:41.625
OKAY.

08:44.834 --> 08:47.750
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. SHELDON.
WAIT, YOU'RE NOT COMING?

08:47.792 --> 08:48.959
No, I am coming.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.792
I-I JUST CAN'T LEAVE YET.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.333
Sheldon,
we need a shrink here.

08:52.375 --> 08:53.750
I MEAN,
VIOLET'S KEEPING IT TOGETHER,

08:53.792 --> 08:55.458
BUT WHO KNOWS HOW LONG
THAT WILL LAST?

08:55.500 --> 08:57.041
YEAH, WELL, I'LL GET THERE
AS SOON AS I CAN.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.000
OKAY.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.959
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
CONSIDERING KILLING YOURSELF?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.208
(exhales deeply)
FEELS LIKE FOREVER.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.208
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
BRING IT UP BEFORE.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.250
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D UNDERSTAND, BUT...

09:14.291 --> 09:16.375
IT REALLY IS FOR THE BEST,
DR. WALLACE.

09:16.417 --> 09:18.041
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

09:18.083 --> 09:20.917
PILLS SEEM EASIEST.

09:20.959 --> 09:25.208
THAT WAY, I'LL GO TO SLEEP
AND...

09:25.250 --> 09:28.041
IT'LL BE OVER.

09:28.083 --> 09:30.083
I'VE GOT TWO KINDS
OF SEDATIVES.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.041
OKAY, NICK.

09:32.083 --> 09:34.583
I THINK WE SHOULD GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.
NO.

09:34.625 --> 09:35.875
I CANNOT LET YOU GO HOME.

09:35.917 --> 09:37.375
I'M NOT GOING
TO THE HOSPITAL.

09:37.417 --> 09:41.041
AH, GOD, I'M SORRY.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.542
I DIDN'T MEAN TO YELL. I...

09:47.291 --> 09:49.041
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
THAT TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT?

09:49.083 --> 09:50.208
I MEAN...

09:50.250 --> 09:52.250
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

09:52.291 --> 09:53.834
I THINK YOU WANT MY HELP,
NICK.

09:53.875 --> 09:55.917
I THINK THAT'S WHY
YOU TOLD ME YOUR PLAN.

09:55.959 --> 09:59.000
BUT I CAN'T GIVE IT UNLESS
YOU'RE GONNA BE HONEST WITH ME.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.542
TRIPLE GRANDE LATTE
WITH ONE SUGAR.

10:08.583 --> 10:11.709
THAT'S GAIL'S ORDER.

10:11.750 --> 10:14.041
I SEE HER GETTING COFFEE
MOST MORNINGS.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.709
UM...

10:15.750 --> 10:19.250
LAST WEEK, SHE FORGOT
HER WALLET, SO I PAID,

10:19.291 --> 10:21.083
AND WE GOT TO TALKING.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.875
SHE WAS...

10:22.917 --> 10:26.000
SHE WAS NICE,
SO I ASKED HER OUT.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.250
W-WHAT DID SHE SAY?

10:30.291 --> 10:32.375
YES. (chuckles)

10:32.417 --> 10:34.542
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

10:34.583 --> 10:36.709
(sighs)

10:36.750 --> 10:38.667
UM, WELL, WE WENT OUT
TO DINNER

10:38.709 --> 10:41.125
AND THEN BACK TO HER PLACE,

10:41.166 --> 10:44.583
AND, UM, NEXT THING I KNEW,

10:44.625 --> 10:46.625
OUR CLOTHES WERE OFF.

10:50.041 --> 10:53.041
AND...

10:53.083 --> 10:56.041
I'VE BEEN SO LONELY.

10:56.083 --> 10:59.291
BUT LOOKING AT GAIL,

10:59.333 --> 11:01.583
I FELT NOTHING.

11:03.250 --> 11:07.583
SO...

11:07.625 --> 11:09.625
I STARTED THINKING
ABOUT STELLA,

11:09.667 --> 11:12.917
HER CREAMY SHOULDERS

11:12.959 --> 11:15.041
PEEKING OUT
FROM A TANK TOP,

11:15.083 --> 11:19.250
HER SMOOTH LITTLE COLT LEGS.
(chuckles)

11:21.125 --> 11:23.166
AND THEN IT WAS OKAY.

11:23.208 --> 11:24.375
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL

11:24.417 --> 11:26.625
FOR MEN TO THINK ABOUT
OTHER WOMEN DURING SEX.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.250
STELLA'S NOT A WOMAN.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.375
(whispers) NO. SHE...

11:32.500 --> 11:34.583
SHE'S MY GODDAUGHTER.

11:36.458 --> 11:39.000
SHE'S 8.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.250
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE PEED SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE?

11:49.291 --> 11:50.375
FIVE.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.250
FIVE TIMES.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.667
GOD, I'D SELL MY SOUL FOR
A GOOD OLD FASHIONED U.T.I.

11:54.709 --> 11:58.166
I CAN BITCH SLAP INTO SUBMISSION
WITH SOME SIMPLE ANTIBIOTICS.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.875
(Charlotte sighs)

11:59.917 --> 12:02.917
SO, UH, VIOLET ASKED ME
THIS THING.

12:02.959 --> 12:05.041
THIS, UM, FUNNY THING.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.667
CRAZY, CLEARLY,

12:06.709 --> 12:09.417
GIVEN WHAT WE'RE, UH...

12:09.458 --> 12:10.625
(object clatters)

12:10.667 --> 12:11.834
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GRIEVING,

12:11.875 --> 12:13.041
SO YOU WANNA GIVE HER
WHAT SHE WANTS.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.041
WHAT'D SHE ASK?

12:15.083 --> 12:17.875
UM... IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO HER,

12:17.917 --> 12:20.000
SHE ASKED IF WE WOULD
TAKE LUCAS.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.417
WE HAVE MASON...

12:23.458 --> 12:25.041
WHO IS AMAZING.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.041
ABOUT WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE
THREE MORE.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.208
YAY, US!

12:28.250 --> 12:30.250
AND YOU WANNA ADD
A FIFTH CHILD

12:30.291 --> 12:33.041
SO WHAT, WE CAN FIELD
OUR OWN VOLLEYBALL TEAM?

12:33.083 --> 12:35.250
OKAY, AREN'T YOU
A TEENSY BIT FLATTERED

12:35.291 --> 12:38.458
THAT SHE RECOGNIZES WHAT
AN INCREDIBLE MOTHER YOU ARE?

12:38.500 --> 12:39.917
WELL, THEN LET'S NOT
STOP THERE.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.875
HELL, WHY NOT THROW HENRY
INTO THE MIX, TOO?

12:42.917 --> 12:44.667
MAKE IT AN EVEN HALF-DOZEN,

12:44.709 --> 12:46.709
'CAUSE WHEN I SAID
I NEVER WANTED CHILDREN,

12:46.750 --> 12:48.834
WHAT I REALLY MEANT WAS,

12:48.875 --> 12:52.041
"I WANT ALL THE CHILDREN."

12:54.333 --> 12:58.041
I NEVER TALKED ABOUT THIS
BEFORE... WITH ANYONE.

12:58.083 --> 13:01.625
NICK, HAVE YOU EVER HAD
ANY SEXUAL CONTACT WITH STELLA?
NEVER.

13:01.667 --> 13:04.041
ANY PHYSICAL CONTACT THAT COULD
BE PERCEIVED AS SEXUAL

13:04.083 --> 13:05.417
WITH ANY CHILD?

13:05.458 --> 13:07.291
NO.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.041
SO YOU'VE NEVER ACTED ON
YOUR DESIRE FOR YOUNG GIRLS?

13:10.083 --> 13:12.542
NO.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.750
BUT I THINK ABOUT IT.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.583
A LOT.

13:16.625 --> 13:19.583
(sighs) I HAVE TO DRIVE PAST
THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

13:19.625 --> 13:21.041
ON THE WAY TO WORK,

13:21.083 --> 13:23.250
AND I TRY TO GET DOWN THE STREET
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE,

13:23.291 --> 13:27.083
BUT... SOMETIMES
THE CROSSING GUARD STOPS ME.

13:27.125 --> 13:31.917
SO... I SIT THERE,

13:31.959 --> 13:35.333
AND I WATCH THE KIDS WALK PAST.

13:39.709 --> 13:44.917
HAVE YOU EVER REALLY LOOKED
AT AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL?

13:46.959 --> 13:48.375
(whispers) I MEAN...

13:49.875 --> 13:53.041
MY GOD.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.000
THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.834
SO INNOCENT.

13:58.875 --> 14:02.542
AND THEIR BODIES ARE LIKE
ABSOLUTE PERFECTION.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.542
YOU THINK I'M DISGUSTING,
DON'T YOU?

14:08.583 --> 14:10.709
NO. I'M NOT HERE
TO JUDGE YOU, NICK.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.417
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND.

14:12.458 --> 14:15.041
IT'S SIMPLE.
I'M A MONSTER.

14:15.083 --> 14:18.208
AND NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY,
I CAN'T CHANGE THE WAY I FEEL.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.542
HOW--HOW DO YOU CONTROL
THESE URGES?

14:20.583 --> 14:24.041
I GO HOME AND...

14:24.083 --> 14:26.583
I, UH...

14:26.625 --> 14:28.041
I RELEASE THE TENSION.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.417
YOU MASTURBATE?

14:29.458 --> 14:30.625
YES.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.834
THAT WAY,
NO ONE GETS HURT.

14:32.875 --> 14:36.333
THAT'S A GOOD SOLUTION,
RIGHT?

14:36.375 --> 14:37.792
MY CONCERN IS THAT

14:37.834 --> 14:40.041
CONTINUAL FANTASIZING ABOUT
SEXUAL ACTS WITH YOUNG GIRLS

14:40.083 --> 14:42.417
CAN MAKE THAT SEEM NORMAL.

14:42.458 --> 14:46.041
AND ONCE THAT TABOO
IS REMOVED,

14:46.083 --> 14:49.041
SELF-RESTRAINT CAN BECOME
VERY DIFFICULT.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.083
I KNOW,

14:50.125 --> 14:54.083
WHICH IS WHY THE ONLY SOLUTION
IS FOR ME TO DIE.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.041
(woman)
I SHOULD BE DEAD.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.208
I WAS DEAD.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.542
I WAS STANDING IN MY KITCHEN,
CHOPPING GARLIC,

15:00.583 --> 15:04.041
TALKING TO MY HUSBAND,
AND THEN I STARTED CONVULSING.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.709
HE CALLS 9-1-1,

15:05.750 --> 15:07.500
AND BY THE TIME
THE PARAMEDICS GOT THERE,

15:07.542 --> 15:09.041
MY HEART HAD STOPPED.

15:09.083 --> 15:13.625
THEY SHOCKED ME THREE TIMES
AND TOOK ME TO THE E.R., AND...

15:13.667 --> 15:16.166
DR. WILDER.
HE BROUGHT ME BACK.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.417
HE DID 20 MINUTES
OF C.P.R.,

15:18.458 --> 15:20.625
SHOCKED ME
THREE MORE TIMES.

15:20.667 --> 15:23.959
HE DIDN'T GIVE UP ON ME.
HE JUST...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.041
(voice breaks) WOULDN'T.

15:26.083 --> 15:27.458
YOUR HUSBAND NEVER GAVE UP.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.542
EXCUSE ME, LADIES,
BUT I NEED TO STEAL VIOLET.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.458
HER SON'S LOOKING FOR HER.
OH. SURE.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.875
WHERE'S LUCAS?

15:32.917 --> 15:35.041
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THOUGHT
YOU NEEDED A BREAK.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.458
(indistinct conversations)

15:37.500 --> 15:40.208
HEY.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.667
JAKE SAID I SHOULD GIVE THIS
THING A TEST DRIVE, SO...

15:45.083 --> 15:47.542
SAM...

15:47.583 --> 15:50.417
I WAS PLANNING ON TELLING YOU
THAT JAKE MOVED IN.

15:50.458 --> 15:51.625
OH, THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S FINE.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.291
THIS IS ACTUALLY
REALLY GOOD ESPRESSO.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.917
I-I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BLINDSIDE YOU OR--

15:54.959 --> 15:56.041
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.917
DID JAKE TELL YOU WHERE
HE GOT THESE BEANS?

15:58.959 --> 16:00.417
NO.
NO?

16:00.458 --> 16:02.625
OH.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.583
LOOK, UM...

16:05.625 --> 16:07.250
(sets down cup)

16:07.291 --> 16:10.792
THERE ARE NO BOOKS ON THIS.
I LOOKED.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.166
WHAT?

16:12.208 --> 16:14.291
ON HOW TO STAY FRIENDS
WITH YOUR EX-WIFE'S BEST FRIEND

16:14.333 --> 16:17.166
WHO REJECTED
YOUR MARRIAGE PROPOSAL

16:17.208 --> 16:18.792
AFTER ADOPTING A CHILD...
(chuckles)

16:18.834 --> 16:22.750
AND THEN MOVING IN
WITH YOUR COWORKER.

16:22.792 --> 16:25.333
THERE ARE NO BOOKS ON IT,
SO...

16:25.375 --> 16:30.041
I FIGURED WE COULD JUST STICK TO
SMALL TALK ABOUT THE ESPRESSO.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.000
OH.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.625
ARE WE?

16:34.667 --> 16:35.834
HMM?

16:35.875 --> 16:37.000
EVER GONNA BE FRIENDS AGAIN?

16:41.333 --> 16:44.041
THE KEY TO A GOOD ESPRESSO
IS THE QUALITY OF THE GRINDER.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.792
OH.

16:45.834 --> 16:49.041
THAT IS AN INTERESTING FACT.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.583
(whispers) GRINDER.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.625
(man) OUR FATHER DIED
TWO YEARS AGO.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.917
IT PRETTY MUCH TOOK THE STARCH
OUT OF MOTHER,

16:54.959 --> 16:57.000
SO WE FIGURED SHE WAS
JUST GRIEVING.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.083
UM, SHE DIDN'T TELL US
ABOUT THE PAIN.

16:59.125 --> 17:02.083
BY THE TIME WE NOTICED IT,
WELL...

17:02.125 --> 17:05.041
WITH PANCREATIC CANCER,
THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.333
AND SHE WANTED TO
DIE AT HOME,

17:07.375 --> 17:08.750
AND SHE MADE US PROMISE.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.041
BUT THAT LAST DAY,

17:11.083 --> 17:15.792
HER BREATHING GOT SO LABORED,
AND SHE LOOKED SO SCARED,

17:15.834 --> 17:17.583
THAT I WANTED TO TAKE HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

17:17.625 --> 17:18.834
YEAH, WE BOTH DID.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.041
BUT DR. WILDER,

17:20.083 --> 17:22.458
HE SAID WE SHOULD HONOR
HER WISHES.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.875
AND WHEN HE CAME INTO THE ROOM,

17:24.917 --> 17:27.333
HE HAD SUCH A CALMING EFFECT
ON HER.

17:27.375 --> 17:30.041
SO SHE GOT TO DIE
IN HER OWN BED,

17:30.083 --> 17:32.542
LOOKING OUT AT HER GARDEN,
SURROUNDED BY HER CHILDREN...

17:32.583 --> 17:34.875
AND DOGS.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.500
AND IT WAS SO PEACEFUL.

17:36.542 --> 17:39.166
I WILL BE GRATEFUL
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE

17:39.208 --> 17:40.792
THAT SHE DIDN'T DIE ALONE.

17:40.834 --> 17:42.834
(sighs)
(sniffles)

17:42.875 --> 17:44.041
(sniffles)

17:47.500 --> 17:50.041
(exhales deeply)

17:50.083 --> 17:53.000
(indistinct conversations)

17:57.709 --> 18:00.291
(Mason)
ARE YOU GONNA HURL?

18:00.333 --> 18:01.583
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

18:01.625 --> 18:03.625
LUCAS WANTED TO WATCH
"THE MUPPETS" MOVIE,

18:03.667 --> 18:05.125
FOR, LIKE, THE BILLIONTH TIME.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.041
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

18:09.083 --> 18:10.458
I...

18:10.500 --> 18:12.333
UM...

18:14.083 --> 18:16.083
IT'S GETTING HOT IN THERE.

18:18.333 --> 18:22.625
PETE WAS NICE.
IT REALLY SUCKS THAT HE DIED.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.625
YEAH.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.959
IT DOES.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.250
HE'LL BE OKAY, THOUGH.

18:34.291 --> 18:35.458
MY MOM SAYS WHEN YOU DIE,

18:35.500 --> 18:37.041
IT'S LIKE GOING TO
A BIG REUNION.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.750
YOU GET TO HANG OUT
WITH EVERYONE YOU REALLY LOVE.

18:40.792 --> 18:43.083
OH, I BET MY MOM WILL INTRODUCE
PETE TO MY GRANDMA.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.583
GRAM'S REALLY COOL.

18:50.083 --> 18:53.709
IT'S--IT'S LONELY, THOUGH,
BEING LEFT BEHIND.

18:53.750 --> 18:57.709
I-I FELT LONELY
WHEN MY MOM DIED.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.667
ARE YOU LONELY?

19:00.709 --> 19:03.917
YEAH.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.583
YOU WANT SOME?

19:18.250 --> 19:20.375
I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC.

19:20.417 --> 19:21.583
DID I TELL YOU THAT?

19:21.625 --> 19:23.000
YEAH.

19:23.041 --> 19:26.959
YEAH, I WAS TAUGHT THAT
GOD NEVER MAKES MISTAKES.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.750
WELL...

19:28.792 --> 19:30.542
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
THAT'S NOT TRUE, HUH?

19:30.583 --> 19:32.709
(inhales deeply)

19:32.750 --> 19:35.375
HE OBVIOUSLY HAD AN OFF DAY
WITH ME.

19:35.417 --> 19:38.041
WHY COULDN'T I HAVE BEEN
A DRUG ADDICT

19:38.083 --> 19:40.166
OR AN ALCOHOLIC?

19:40.208 --> 19:42.000
I MEAN, GOD.

19:42.041 --> 19:43.375
MY LIFE WOULD'VE BEEN
SO MUCH DIFFERENT

19:43.417 --> 19:45.792
IF THE THING I COULDN'T
GET ENOUGH OF WAS BOOZE.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.208
I MEAN, I-I COULD JOIN
A 12-STEP PROGRAM.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.458
PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY
WANNA HEAR MY STORY.

19:50.500 --> 19:56.250
THEY'D TRY TO HELP ME AND SAY
HOW BRAVE I WAS TO COME CLEAN.

19:56.291 --> 19:58.041
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
SUPPORT GROUPS

19:58.083 --> 19:59.500
FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.834
I CAN'T TELL ANYONE WHAT I AM.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.041
BUT YOU TOLD ME,

20:06.083 --> 20:08.375
AND THAT'S A GOOD
FIRST STEP.

20:08.417 --> 20:10.959
AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVEN'T
ACTED ON YOUR IMPULSES,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.125
WE CAN BUILD ON THAT.

20:12.166 --> 20:15.375
DON'T PLAY ME, DR. WALLACE.

20:15.417 --> 20:16.792
I'M NOT STUPID.

20:16.834 --> 20:18.333
AS A TEENAGER,

20:18.375 --> 20:21.959
I USED TO JUST HOPE
THAT I WOULD OUTGROW THIS.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.375
BUT...

20:23.417 --> 20:24.583
(whispers) NO.

20:24.625 --> 20:26.041
(normal voice)
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

20:26.083 --> 20:30.041
RIGHT? 'CAUSE THERE'S
NO MAGIC PILLS THAT I CAN TAKE

20:30.083 --> 20:32.041
THAT MAKE ME STOP FANTASIZING
ABOUT LITTLE GIRLS.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.417
THERE'S NO SURGERY

20:34.458 --> 20:37.834
TO REMOVE THIS DEVIANT PART
OF MY BRAIN, RIGHT?

20:40.041 --> 20:42.166
RIGHT?

20:42.208 --> 20:44.000
NO, THERE ISN'T.

20:44.041 --> 20:47.375
THEN WHAT DO WE HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT?

20:47.417 --> 20:50.375
(indistinct conversations)

20:50.417 --> 20:53.834
DID PETE EVEN LIKE KARAOKE?

20:53.875 --> 20:56.500
I DON'T KNOW. I NEVER...

20:56.542 --> 20:59.208
HEARD THE MAN
SO MUCH AS WHISTLE. (chuckles)

20:59.250 --> 21:02.208
YOU DID NOT MISS MUCH.
(chuckles)

21:02.250 --> 21:04.458
I LOVED PETE.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.250
WE WEREN'T IN LOVE,
WE WEREN'T SOUL MATES,

21:07.291 --> 21:09.041
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE FIT TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE.

21:09.083 --> 21:12.041
YOU KNOW, THAT TIME THAT WE HAD
WHERE WE...

21:12.083 --> 21:13.959
TOOK CARE OF LUCAS.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.041
EVEN FOR THAT SHORT TIME
BEFORE VIOLET CAME BACK,

21:16.083 --> 21:17.917
THAT'S...
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW

21:17.959 --> 21:19.667
THAT I COULD RAISE A CHILD
ON MY OWN.

21:19.709 --> 21:21.917
PETE DID THAT FOR ME.

21:21.959 --> 21:23.041
MM.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.041
I WISH I COULD'VE
TOLD HIM THAT.

21:25.083 --> 21:28.333
YOU KNOW, VIOLET ASKED ME TO BE
LUCAS' GUARDIAN

21:28.375 --> 21:30.500
IN CASE ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO...

21:30.542 --> 21:32.375
DID YOU TELL HER ABOUT
THE TRIPLETS?

21:32.417 --> 21:33.583
IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED,

21:33.625 --> 21:35.041
CHARLOTTE'S A LITTLE SCARY
RIGHT NOW.

21:35.083 --> 21:37.333
YEAH, I GOT THAT.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.750
I MEAN, I'D LOVE TO SAY YES
FOR VIOLET,

21:39.792 --> 21:42.250
AND FOR PETE.

21:42.291 --> 21:44.583
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO CONVINCE CHARLOTTE.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.000
(chuckles)

21:47.041 --> 21:48.792
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW IF
I SHOULD CONVINCE CHARLOTTE.

21:48.834 --> 21:52.166
I MEAN,
WITH THESE BABIES COMING,

21:52.208 --> 21:54.333
MY FAMILY HAS TO BE
MY PRIORITY, RIGHT?

21:54.375 --> 21:56.917
YES.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.834
ANY ADVICE ON THAT?

22:02.792 --> 22:04.000
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK.

22:06.625 --> 22:10.041
I WAS IN THE KITCHEN LAST WEEK.
PETE WAS READING THE PAPER.

22:10.083 --> 22:12.083
TRAVEL SECTION,
ABOUT HAWAII.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.542
SAID HE WAS THINKING ABOUT
TAKING VIOLET AND LUCAS THERE

22:15.583 --> 22:16.792
ONCE THE TRIAL WAS OVER,

22:16.834 --> 22:19.583
LIKE HE WAS CERTAIN
IT WAS GONNA GO HIS WAY.

22:19.625 --> 22:20.792
HMM.

22:20.834 --> 22:23.291
SAID HE ALWAYS WANTED
TO LEARN HOW TO SURF.

22:23.333 --> 22:24.500
(chuckles)

22:24.542 --> 22:25.709
MM.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.000
I TOLD HIM, "HEY, I, UH,
I HAVE AN EXTRA BOARD.

22:27.041 --> 22:30.083
I CAN--I CAN TEACH YOU."

22:30.125 --> 22:31.709
(taps countertop)

22:31.750 --> 22:33.792
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
WE SPOKE.

22:33.834 --> 22:38.583
YEAH, HE WAS ONE OF
THE GOOD ONES.

22:38.625 --> 22:42.375
AFTER ALL THE TIME HE SPENT
MAKING DEATH EASIER FOR PEOPLE,

22:42.417 --> 22:45.041
I WISH SOMEBODY
COULD'VE DONE IT FOR HIM.

22:45.083 --> 22:48.000
YEAH. YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T DO
WHAT HE DID.

22:48.041 --> 22:50.166
I NEED TO BE AROUND PEOPLE
CREATING LIFE,

22:50.208 --> 22:52.375
HELPING THEM START A FAMILY.

22:52.417 --> 22:56.041
YOU KNOW, NO MATTER HOW HARD
THE JOURNEY IS,

22:56.083 --> 22:58.000
I'VE NEVER ONCE HAD A MOTHER
TELL ME THAT IT WASN'T WORTH IT

22:58.041 --> 22:59.625
ONCE SHE HELD HER CHILD.

22:59.667 --> 23:02.458
HAS ADDISON BEEN TALKING
TO YOU?

23:02.500 --> 23:04.291
ABOUT WHAT?

23:06.083 --> 23:10.041
(indistinct conversations)

23:10.083 --> 23:11.709
DO ME A FAVOR.
(sighs)

23:11.750 --> 23:13.083
DON'T TELL ME
ANY STORIES ABOUT PETE

23:13.125 --> 23:14.625
OR TRY TO MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

23:14.667 --> 23:17.709
HEY. I JUST WANTED A COOKIE.

23:21.667 --> 23:25.041
THAT JACKET LOOKS GOOD
ON YOU.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.583
YEAH.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.041
I FIGURED I'D GET THE MOTORCYCLE
TO GO WITH IT NEXT.

23:28.083 --> 23:31.000
(plastic rustling)

23:32.500 --> 23:34.291
OHH.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.500
UH, OR PERHAPS A LIGHTER.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.834
HOLY CRAP. I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS IN THERE.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.375
VIOLET?

23:40.417 --> 23:44.083
I'M AARON COLVIN. I WORKED
WITH PETE IN EL SALVADOR.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.500
OH. THANK YOU FOR COMING.

23:45.542 --> 23:46.709
I'M SURE THAT WOULD'VE
MEANT A LOT TO PETE.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.041
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

23:48.083 --> 23:52.041
PETE AND I,
WE HAD A FALLING OUT

23:52.083 --> 23:53.500
15 YEARS AGO.

23:53.542 --> 23:55.417
IT ENDED IN A FISTFIGHT.

23:55.458 --> 23:59.959
FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I-I CAN'T
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.083
I ALWAYS FIGURED OUR PATHS
WOULD CROSS AGAIN

24:02.125 --> 24:04.458
AND WE'D SIT DOWN
AND HAVE A BEER

24:04.500 --> 24:08.542
AND LAUGH ABOUT IT.

24:08.583 --> 24:11.834
BUT NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

24:11.875 --> 24:13.959
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WASTED ALL THIS TIME,

24:14.000 --> 24:17.750
NURSING SOME RIDICULOUS,
ANCIENT GRUDGE THAT--

24:17.792 --> 24:19.000
COULD YOU PLEASE EXCUSE ME?

24:26.083 --> 24:28.083
THERE'S A LOT THAT WE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT PEDOPHILIA,

24:28.125 --> 24:30.333
ABOUT HUMAN SEXUALITY
IN GENERAL.

24:30.375 --> 24:34.083
BUT WHAT I CAN TELL IS THAT BY
THE TIME WE'RE 8 OR 9 YEARS OLD,

24:34.125 --> 24:35.291
WE'VE BEEN DEALT A CARD,

24:35.333 --> 24:37.041
AND THAT DETERMINES
WHAT TURNS US ON.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.375
AND IN THE PERFECT WORLD,

24:39.417 --> 24:43.041
SATISFYING THOSE URGES,
IT DOESN'T HURT ANYBODY.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.500
I OBVIOUSLY DON'T LIVE
IN THAT WORLD.

24:45.542 --> 24:48.750
I'M A FREAK.
YOU CAN'T FIX ME.

24:48.792 --> 24:51.000
I CAN'T CURE YOUR
SEXUAL ATTRACTION TO CHILDREN.

24:51.041 --> 24:53.000
THAT'S TRUE.

24:53.041 --> 24:54.792
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE
INAPPROPRIATE FANTASIES,

24:54.834 --> 24:58.625
AND THE PROBLEM ONLY ARISES
WHEN THEY TRY TO ACT ON THEM.

24:58.667 --> 25:00.875
WE CAN WORK
ON YOUR IMPULSE CONTROL.

25:00.917 --> 25:03.041
IT'S NOT EASY.
IT'S A LIFELONG STRUGGLE.

25:03.083 --> 25:05.041
BUT WE CAN PROTECT
THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

25:05.083 --> 25:07.375
WAIT.

25:07.417 --> 25:08.792
YOU'RE SAYING I CAN CHANGE?

25:08.834 --> 25:12.583
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN TRY.

25:12.625 --> 25:14.375
AVOIDING MOOD SWINGS IS KEY.

25:14.417 --> 25:17.041
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE
DILIGENT ABOUT KEEPING BUSY,

25:17.083 --> 25:21.041
ABOUT MAINTAINING STRUCTURE
IN YOUR LIFE.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

25:22.792 --> 25:25.041
YOU ACTUALLY WANNA HELP ME?

25:25.083 --> 25:27.208
I'M YOUR DOCTOR.
NICK? NICK?

25:27.250 --> 25:28.417
(groans)

25:28.458 --> 25:29.583
NICK, ARE YOU OKAY?

25:29.625 --> 25:30.959
(retches)

25:31.000 --> 25:34.583
NICK, WHAT DID YOU DO?
WHAT DID YOU TAKE?
(groaning)

25:34.625 --> 25:36.041
(cell phone auto dials)
NICK?

25:36.083 --> 25:38.166
THIS IS DR. SHELDON WALLACE.

25:38.208 --> 25:40.959
I NEED AN AMBULANCE
AT 4000 OCEAN PARK.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.625
IT'S A POSSIBLE OVERDOSE.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.583
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T WANNA DIE ALONE.

25:45.625 --> 25:48.792
(grunting)

25:50.208 --> 25:51.583
VIOLET?

25:51.625 --> 25:55.041
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

25:55.083 --> 25:56.375
VIOLET, YOU'VE BEEN UP HERE
A WHILE.

25:56.417 --> 25:58.917
I'M STARTING TO GET WORRIED.

26:02.625 --> 26:04.834
OKAY, I'M COMING IN.

26:06.458 --> 26:07.667
HEY.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.667
ARE YOU...

26:10.709 --> 26:13.000
(sniffs)

26:14.417 --> 26:16.041
ARE YOU... GETTING HIGH?

26:16.083 --> 26:18.000
(coughs)

26:25.083 --> 26:26.375
(inhales deeply)

26:26.417 --> 26:28.917
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!

26:28.959 --> 26:30.375
THIS IS A REALLY BIG TUB.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.750
YOU GUYS CANNOT DO THIS. I HAVE
A--I HAVE A KID DOWNSTAIRS.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.625
OH, COME ON. WE ALL HAVE KIDS,
AND THEY'RE ALL NEXT DOOR.

26:34.667 --> 26:37.041
GET IN THE TUB, COOP.
COME ON!

26:37.083 --> 26:39.542
YOU KNOW YOU WANNA DO IT.
COME ON! GET IN THE TUB.

26:39.583 --> 26:41.041
YOU DON'T HAVE TO. I DIDN'T.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.709
YOU JUST GIVE HER A MINUTE,
SHE'LL FORGET SHE ASKED.

26:42.750 --> 26:44.500
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT HIGH?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

26:44.542 --> 26:46.542
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT SHE SHOULD BE ALONE.
(sniffs)

26:46.583 --> 26:47.875
MY HUSBAND IS DEAD.

26:47.917 --> 26:50.041
YESTERDAY, I PUSHED A BUTTON
AND WATCHED HIM BURN,

26:50.083 --> 26:51.458
SO I GET WHATEVER I WANT
TODAY.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.250
(sighs)

26:54.291 --> 26:56.041
COME ON, COOPER.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.500
I REALLY NEED SOMEONE
IN THE TUB WITH ME.

27:01.834 --> 27:03.500
NO.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO LAY DOWN
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?

27:07.041 --> 27:09.709
LET'S LIVE HERE, IN THE TUB.

27:14.083 --> 27:15.333
DRUGS ARE BAD.

27:15.375 --> 27:16.875
MM.

27:16.917 --> 27:18.041
DRUGS ARE BAD.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.667
THEY MAKE MY TONGUE FEEL
LIKE CHEESE.

27:19.709 --> 27:22.375
CHEESE? I WISH WE HAD
SOME CHEESE HERE.

27:22.417 --> 27:24.041
(gasps) ADDISON?

27:24.083 --> 27:25.250
YES?
ADDISON?

27:25.291 --> 27:26.458
WHAT?
ADDISON?

27:26.500 --> 27:27.792
STILL HERE.
CHEESE?

27:27.834 --> 27:29.041
WHERE DOES CHEESE COME?
HOW DO WE GET CHEESE?

27:29.083 --> 27:30.917
IS THERE A CHEESE MAN?
(groans)

27:30.959 --> 27:33.667
OHH!

27:33.709 --> 27:35.041
I THINK WE NEED A COW.

27:35.083 --> 27:37.250
OH, LET'S BUY A COW.
BUY A COW!
I COULD TOTALLY BUY A COW!

27:37.291 --> 27:39.500
(laughing)

27:39.542 --> 27:41.792
OR... I COULD ORDER
A PIZZA.

27:41.834 --> 27:44.625
I HAVE A PHONE. WE CAN.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.417
(sighs)

27:50.458 --> 27:52.375
CHARLOTTE'S NOT GONNA
LET YOU GET AWAY WITH THIS

27:52.417 --> 27:53.583
MUCH LONGER, COOPER.

27:53.625 --> 27:54.792
CHARLOTTE'S NOT
THE BOSS OF ME, MAN.

27:54.834 --> 27:55.834
NO.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.041
CHARLOTTE IS THE MOTHER
OF MY TRIPLETS,

27:57.083 --> 27:58.792
BUT NOT THE BOSS OF ME.
TRIPLETS? WHAT TRIPLETS?

27:58.834 --> 28:00.500
(grunts)

28:00.542 --> 28:02.000
HMM?

28:02.041 --> 28:03.041
OH! OHH!

28:03.083 --> 28:05.000
WHOO!

28:05.041 --> 28:06.041
(laughs)
OKAY.

28:06.083 --> 28:07.792
OH, MY GOD. OKAY.
(chuckles)

28:07.834 --> 28:09.333
OKAY.

28:09.375 --> 28:11.041
(laughs)
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.
I'M SORRY.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.166
I KNOW THAT IS
THE KIND OF THING

28:13.208 --> 28:14.625
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL
YOUR BEST FRIEND,

28:14.667 --> 28:16.375
BUT CHARLOTTE WOULD NOT
LET ME TELL YOU.

28:16.417 --> 28:19.000
I SO WANTED TO TELL YOU!
(gasps) TRIPLETS!

28:19.041 --> 28:22.125
AND ADDISON ONLY KNOWS
BECAUSE SHE IS HER DOCTOR.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.166
YEAH.
AND IT FELT REALLY WEIRD
TO TALK ABOUT BABIES

28:24.208 --> 28:25.166
ONCE I FOUND OUT
PETE WAS DEAD.

28:25.208 --> 28:26.375
OH, YEAH.

28:26.417 --> 28:29.041
AND ALSO,
I'M LIKE... (laughs)

28:29.083 --> 28:31.041
I'M SO HAPPY.
(laughs)

28:31.083 --> 28:34.208
(laughing) AND CHARLOTTE IS...
SO NOT HAPPY.

28:34.250 --> 28:37.250
(laughing)

28:39.250 --> 28:41.041
(inhales and exhales deeply)

28:41.083 --> 28:42.166
(coughs)

28:42.208 --> 28:46.000
(continues laughing)

28:46.041 --> 28:48.041
(doorbell rings)

28:48.083 --> 28:50.208
OH. HEY, I-I THINK YOU HAVE
THE WRONG HOUSE.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.417
HI. OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, HE DOESN'T.

28:52.458 --> 28:53.834
HERE YOU GO.
KEEP THE CHANGE.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.041
THANK YOU.

28:55.083 --> 28:56.375
WHOA, ADDISON,

28:56.417 --> 28:57.875
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT MORE THAN
ENOUGH FOOD FOR EVERYBODY.

28:57.917 --> 29:00.542
UH, NO, THIS ISN'T FOR
THE PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.041
WHO'S IT FOR?

29:02.083 --> 29:04.083
(Cooper speaks indistinctly)
OH. ARE YOU SERIOUS?

29:04.125 --> 29:06.625
CHEESE MEN. CHEESE MEN.
(gasps) HEY!

29:06.667 --> 29:08.208
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

29:08.250 --> 29:10.041
(Jake) OKAY, WE ARE GOING
TO NEED MORE PIZZAS.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.417
(speaks indistinctly)

29:11.458 --> 29:13.625
PEOPLE ARE DOWNSTAIRS,
TRYING TO PAY TRIBUTE TO PETE,

29:13.667 --> 29:15.166
AND YOU GUYS ARE UP HERE
GETTING HIGH?

29:15.208 --> 29:17.041
LIGHTEN UP, MAN.
LIGHT UP, SAM.

29:17.083 --> 29:20.041
OH, NO, HE'S NOT GONNA
DO IT. HE'S NEVER DONE THAT.

29:20.083 --> 29:21.500
(Violet, mouth full)
IS THAT TRUE?
(Cooper) REALLY?

29:21.542 --> 29:23.041
(mouth full) LIKE,
FROM A CHICKEN THING?

29:23.083 --> 29:24.041
NO, I'M NOT CHICKEN.

29:24.083 --> 29:26.041
MNH.
BOK BOK BOK.

29:26.083 --> 29:27.500
(Cooper and Violet laughing)
(Sam) DID YOU JUST CLUCK AT ME?

29:27.542 --> 29:30.458
BOK BOK BOK.
SEE--SEE, THAT'S WHY
DON'T DO IT.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.834
(Cooper and Violet clucking)
IT'S GOT YOU GUYS ACTING
LIKE IDIOTS,

29:33.875 --> 29:35.834
GROWN ADULTS MAKING
ANIMAL SOUNDS.
BOK!

29:35.875 --> 29:38.333
NOT TO MENTION IT'S ILLEGAL.
NOT WHEN MEDICALLY PRESCRIBED
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

29:38.375 --> 29:40.041
I'M A DOCTOR.

29:40.083 --> 29:41.750
VIOLET, I PRESCRIBE YOU
MARIJUANA.

29:41.792 --> 29:43.125
COOPER, I PRESCRIBE YOU
MARIJUANA.

29:43.166 --> 29:45.542
JAKE, SHALL I
PRESCRIBE YOU MARIJUANA?

29:45.583 --> 29:47.083
I'M GOOD, THANKS.
(mouth full) BESIDES,

29:47.125 --> 29:49.041
NOBODY'S GONNA TELL ME WHAT
I CAN DO IN MY OWN DAMN HOUSE.

29:49.083 --> 29:50.959
IN MY OWN DAMN HOUSE.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.667
OH. THERE EITHER. (laughs)
DOCTOR'S ORDER, SAM.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.041
I'M SORRY. I JUST CARE ABOUT
WHAT I PUT INTO MY BODY.

29:56.083 --> 29:58.041
I CARE ABOUT
MY SHORT-TERM MEMORY.

29:58.083 --> 30:01.083
MARIJUANA ABUSE HAS ALSO BEEN
TIED TO CANCER, BRAIN DAMAGE,

30:01.125 --> 30:02.792
DEPRESSION.
IT'S ALSO BEEN TIED

30:02.834 --> 30:04.709
TO RELIEVING SYMPTOMS
OF ALL THOSE THINGS, SAM.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.041
YOU'RE DEFENDING THEM
RIGHT NOW?

30:06.083 --> 30:07.500
IF YOU'RE SUCH A FAN,
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT SMOKING?

30:07.542 --> 30:09.583
BECAUSE THE ONE TIME
I SMOKED POT,

30:09.625 --> 30:11.542
I FELT LIKE MY LUNGS
WERE MELTING.

30:11.583 --> 30:13.333
(laughs)
AND I GOT SO PARANOID

30:13.375 --> 30:14.750
I HID IN THE CLOSET
FOR THREE HOURS

30:14.792 --> 30:16.125
AND I MIGHT'VE PEED MY PANTS.

30:16.166 --> 30:17.750
(Cooper and Violet laugh)

30:17.792 --> 30:19.750
(laughs)
JAKE?

30:19.792 --> 30:20.834
NOT FOR ME.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.291
YOU KNOW,
IT'S PETE'S GANJA, SAM.

30:25.333 --> 30:27.375
IT'S LIKE A SIGN.

30:27.417 --> 30:29.375
I MEAN, PETE IS THE REASON
WE'RE ALL HERE.

30:29.417 --> 30:33.834
AND WE'RE ALL HERE,
AND PETE IS GONE?

30:33.875 --> 30:37.000
THAT'S WRONG. IT--IT'S JUST
ALL KINDS OF WRONG.

30:37.041 --> 30:40.041
I DON'T KNOW.
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

30:40.083 --> 30:42.709
AND IT JUST FEELS BAD.
AND WHO WANTS TO FEEL BAD?

30:42.750 --> 30:44.834
WHO WANTS TO FEEL
WHEN FEELING FEELS THIS BAD?

30:46.875 --> 30:48.417
WHAT HE SAID.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.041
VIOLET?

30:52.041 --> 30:53.125
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO DOWNSTAIRS

30:53.166 --> 30:56.041
AND TELL THOSE PEOPLE
TO GO HOME?

30:56.083 --> 30:57.375
I CAN DO THAT.

30:57.417 --> 31:01.041
CAN WE JUST STAY HERE
A LITTLE BIT LONGER?

31:01.083 --> 31:02.125
A LITTLE BIT, ALL OF US?

31:02.166 --> 31:04.375
THEN I'LL GO BACK TO BEING
A WIDOW.

31:04.417 --> 31:06.625
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

31:12.667 --> 31:16.417
HE NEVER ATE THE CRUST
OFF HIS PIZZA.

31:16.458 --> 31:20.125
BUT HE LOVED
CHOCOLATE CHIP MINT ICE CREAM.

31:20.166 --> 31:23.583
AND HE COULDN'T PARALLEL PARK
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.041
HE HAD REALLY AWESOME HAIR.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.166
MM.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.375
(inhales and exhales deeply)

31:41.333 --> 31:42.709
(intercom beeps)

31:42.750 --> 31:46.542
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

31:50.750 --> 31:52.291
I'M ALIVE.

31:52.333 --> 31:53.500
BARELY.

31:53.542 --> 31:55.166
THE E.R. DOC SAID
THE ACETAMINOPHEN LEVEL

31:55.208 --> 31:58.166
IN YOUR BLOOD PUT YOU AT RISK
FOR LIVER FAILURE.

31:58.208 --> 32:02.041
ANOTHER FEW HOURS, YOUR LIVER
MIGHT'VE COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

32:02.083 --> 32:05.250
I SWALLOWED THE WHOLE BOTTLE
BEFORE I CAME TO SEE YOU.

32:08.083 --> 32:10.000
ARE YOU GONNA
DO THAT AGAIN, NICK?

32:12.166 --> 32:14.625
I DON'T KNOW.

32:14.667 --> 32:18.041
I STUDIED BUDDHISM
FOR A WHILE.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.041
NOT TO CONVERT.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.208
I JUST WANTED TO UNDERSTAND

32:20.250 --> 32:22.333
A RELIGION WHOSE GOAL
WAS TO END SUFFERING.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.083
YOU KNOW
THE INTERESTING THING?

32:25.125 --> 32:27.458
SUFFERING IS A GREAT TEACHER,

32:27.500 --> 32:29.458
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU MIGHT BECOME

32:29.500 --> 32:31.208
AFTER YOU WORK THROUGH IT,

32:31.250 --> 32:35.709
WHICH IS WHY EVERY LIFE
IS WORTH SAVING.

32:37.542 --> 32:39.041
EVEN MINE?

32:39.083 --> 32:40.542
YES.

32:42.375 --> 32:44.542
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN HELP ME?

32:44.583 --> 32:47.458
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

32:47.500 --> 32:52.041
BUT IF WE DO WORK TOGETHER, YOU
CANNOT KEEP ANY SECRETS FROM ME.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.959
(whispers) I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE TO KEEP.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.333
WELL, THEN I'LL BE BACK
IN THE MORNING.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.333
(mouths word)

33:09.208 --> 33:12.083
(indistinct conversations)

33:12.125 --> 33:13.500
HEY.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.792
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY.

33:15.834 --> 33:19.917
(sighs) OKAY, I'M GONNA SAY IT,
AND YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN.

33:19.959 --> 33:22.333
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS
TO VIOLET?

33:22.375 --> 33:24.583
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF PERSON

33:24.625 --> 33:27.208
WOULD LEAVE A LITTLE BOY
PARENTLESS,

33:27.250 --> 33:28.834
OUT IN THE STREET?

33:28.875 --> 33:30.750
(lowered voice)
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, COOPER.

33:30.792 --> 33:35.000
OF COURSE WE'LL TAKE LUCAS
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO VIOLET.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.750
WE WILL?

33:37.792 --> 33:40.041
MY LIFE AS I KNOW IT
IS OVER.

33:40.083 --> 33:43.709
WE'VE ALREADY GOT FOUR KIDS.
WHAT'S ONE MORE?

33:43.750 --> 33:45.959
I'M GONNA NEED SOME HELP
PARENTING THAT BROOD.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.250
I'D PREFER IT
IF YOU WEREN'T STONED.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.792
OH, CAKE.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.625
AND DR. WILDER WAS THERE FOR ME
ALL THROUGH MY CANCER.

34:04.667 --> 34:07.166
NOTHING WORKED ON THE NAUSEA
I HAD FROM THE CHEMO

34:07.208 --> 34:09.333
UNTIL HE TRIED ACUPUNCTURE.
(cell phone rings)

34:09.375 --> 34:10.959
EXCUSE ME.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.333
IT'S DEREK.

34:12.375 --> 34:15.417
HE GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.041
I'M SO GRATEFUL.

34:17.083 --> 34:20.000
STOP CRYING.
MY HUSBAND WANTED A CELEBRATION.

34:20.041 --> 34:22.250
I'M SORRY. I JUST...

34:22.291 --> 34:23.917
(sobbing)

34:25.417 --> 34:27.041
THEY, UH...

34:27.083 --> 34:30.375
THEY TOOK MARK SLOAN
OFF LIFE SUPPORT.

34:30.417 --> 34:31.583
(continues sobbing)

34:31.625 --> 34:33.208
(voice breaks) HE'S DEAD.

34:33.250 --> 34:35.792
NO, NO, NO. NO. NO.
NO, WE DON'T CRY TODAY.

34:35.834 --> 34:37.041
(continues sobbing)

34:37.083 --> 34:39.041
WE DON'T CRY TODAY.
THIS IS NOT WHAT PETE WANTED.

34:39.083 --> 34:40.792
WAS I NOT CLEAR?

34:40.834 --> 34:44.083
HE WANTED A PARTY.
HE WANTED--HE WANTED SINGING.

"MR. NEVER GIVE UP,"

35:49.792 --> 35:50.875
THAT WAS NOT PETE.

35:50.917 --> 35:52.250
HE DID GIVE UP.

35:52.291 --> 35:56.291
HE DIED BEFORE HE COULD TELL ME
WHAT WENT WRONG IN OUR MARRIAGE.

35:56.333 --> 35:59.792
HOW DARE HE LEAVE ME
TO RAISE LUCAS ON MY OWN?!

35:59.834 --> 36:02.542
HOW DARE HE DEMAND
THAT I THROW HIM A PARTY

36:02.583 --> 36:07.667

36:35.083 --> 36:37.625

36:37.667 --> 36:39.834
I'M SORRY.

36:39.875 --> 36:41.375
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

36:41.417 --> 36:43.041
BRING MY HUSBAND BACK.

36:43.083 --> 36:47.458
IF IT WERE IN MY POWER,
YOU KNOW I WOULD.

36:47.500 --> 36:50.000
TELL ME EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.125
VIOLET.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.208
JUST...

36:53.250 --> 36:55.125

37:05.709 --> 37:07.291
YOUR UNCLE PETE WON'T BE AROUND
WHEN YOU GROW UP,

37:07.333 --> 37:09.917
HE'LL STILL
BE WATCHING OUT FOR YOU.

37:09.959 --> 37:12.625
NOW YOU HAVE
YOUR VERY OWN GUARDIAN ANGEL...

37:12.667 --> 37:14.625

37:14.667 --> 37:17.083
YOU DO.

37:19.917 --> 37:23.250

OF PETE LOOKING OUT FOR HIM.

37:24.709 --> 37:28.208
THANK YOU FOR, UH,
TAKING CARE OF HIM TODAY.

37:28.250 --> 37:31.375
OF COURSE.
YOU HAD YOUR HANDS FULL.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.417
HUH?

37:33.458 --> 37:35.583
I LIED TO YOU.

37:35.625 --> 37:36.792
ABOUT WHAT?

37:36.834 --> 37:39.250
WHEN I TURNED YOU DOWN
TO BE MY SURROGATE,

37:39.291 --> 37:42.709
I TOLD YOU IT WAS BECAUSE
YOU WERE NEWLY SOBER

37:42.750 --> 37:45.041
AND YOU NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT
WHO YOU ARE,

37:45.083 --> 37:47.000
AND THAT WAS PART OF IT,
BUT...

37:48.166 --> 37:51.041
I ALSO DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE
GOOD ENOUGH.

37:51.083 --> 37:53.041
WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

37:53.083 --> 37:54.875
I WAS WRONG.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.417
YOU ARE...

37:57.458 --> 37:59.333
SUCH A GOOD THING
IN MY SON'S LIFE.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.917
HE LOVES YOU SO MUCH.

38:01.959 --> 38:05.208
