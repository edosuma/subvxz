I told you I was gonna
have to break a few rules.

27:12.375 --> 27:15.776
No, no, no, you don't
understand. This is the
least of our problems,

27:15.876 --> 27:18.359
which ought to give
you an idea how bad
our problems are.

27:18.459 --> 27:20.109
Come on, it can't be that bad.

27:20.209 --> 27:22.567
Unless I'm mistaken,
Cole has teamed up with Jeric

27:22.667 --> 27:24.526
and tricked me into
getting Paige possessed

27:24.626 --> 27:26.275
and Phoebe mummified.

27:26.375 --> 27:28.999
- What?
- I've had it with this outfit.

27:32.042 --> 27:33.734
What are you gonna do?

27:33.834 --> 27:36.651
What does it look
like I'm gonna do?

27:36.751 --> 27:38.859
I meant about
Paige and Phoebe.

27:38.959 --> 27:42.109
Well, you're gonna orb me back
there so I can kick some demon
ass.

27:42.209 --> 27:44.567
And, honey, you know,
you can change too.

27:44.667 --> 27:47.542
Felon orange
isn't exactly your color.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.317
PIPER: I should have never
gone to Cole in the first place.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.609
I don't know what
I was thinking.

27:53.709 --> 27:56.150
You were thinking about
saving Phoebe.

27:56.250 --> 27:58.109
PIPER: Yeah, that worked out
really well, didn't it?

27:58.209 --> 28:01.192
The one thing I don't understand
is why Cole sent me back here.

28:01.292 --> 28:03.609
I mean, he could have sent me to
the far reaches of the universe

28:03.709 --> 28:07.150
or worse, but he didn't.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.150
Cole sent you back?
From where?

28:09.250 --> 28:13.899
PIPER: The only thing I can
think of is that he needs me
for something.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.359
But what?

28:15.459 --> 28:16.899
Well, whatever it is,

28:16.999 --> 28:19.609
going back there,
wherever there is,

28:19.709 --> 28:21.359
would be exactly
what he wants you to do.

28:21.459 --> 28:25.484
But I'm not gonna leave my
sisters in Egypt with two
demonic perverts.

28:25.584 --> 28:26.900
I'm the reason
they're in this mess.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.609
I lost Paige because I was
trying to save Phoebe.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.651
Cole would never hurt Phoebe,
you know that.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.899
And he must need Paige
for a reason.

28:33.999 --> 28:35.651
Otherwise, why go through
the trouble to get her?

28:35.751 --> 28:37.776
So, what am I supposed to do?

28:37.876 --> 28:39.109
You're gonna do
what you do best.

28:39.209 --> 28:40.609
You're gonna go
on the offensive

28:40.709 --> 28:43.000
and you're gonna summon Cole
before he summons you.

28:43.999 --> 28:45.334
[SIGHS]

28:53.250 --> 28:55.900
PAIGE:
Oh, right there.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.899
That's perfect.

28:57.999 --> 28:59.734
Yes, you're rather tense.

28:59.834 --> 29:02.692
It's not me. It's this witch.

29:02.792 --> 29:06.359
She's overworked this body
and she doesn't deserve it.

29:06.459 --> 29:09.025
You'll have to finish
the power of three spell...

29:09.125 --> 29:10.234
...if you expect to
take it from her.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.899
I will, in a bit.

29:12.999 --> 29:15.983
You can't put it
off any longer.

29:16.083 --> 29:19.275
This witch is as powerful as the
last and she'll burn out just as
quickly.

29:19.375 --> 29:22.584
Just a minute more.

29:24.250 --> 29:26.751
Sorry. I think
you've relaxed enough.

29:27.999 --> 29:30.150
I don't.

29:30.250 --> 29:31.899
But then again...

29:31.999 --> 29:34.818
...I always have been
such a bad girl.

29:34.918 --> 29:36.292
We can be bad later.

29:38.083 --> 29:40.317
COLE: Playtime is over,
boys and girls.

29:40.417 --> 29:42.484
Do you mind?

29:42.584 --> 29:45.192
- No, I don't.
- Well, I do.

29:45.292 --> 29:47.609
COLE:
Did I ever tell you, Jeric,

29:47.709 --> 29:51.501
that I have eyes
for only one witch?

29:55.417 --> 29:58.417
- How's the spell going?
- I was just about to finish it.

30:02.834 --> 30:06.150
She can't expel the witch's soul
without the power of three.

30:06.250 --> 30:07.818
How are you gonna get it for us?

30:07.918 --> 30:10.526
Look around,
we're only one sister short.

30:10.626 --> 30:13.401
Yes, but your love is a mummy.

30:13.501 --> 30:16.899
- Yeah.
- You can't expect her
to read a spell.

30:16.999 --> 30:18.734
Well, she doesn't have to.

30:18.834 --> 30:23.109
If her spirit is trapped inside,
all her sisters have to do is
touch her,

30:23.209 --> 30:24.734
to tap into the power.

30:24.834 --> 30:26.234
And what about the third witch?

30:26.334 --> 30:28.192
I doubt she'll read
the spell willingly.

30:28.292 --> 30:30.899
Leave it to me.
I can be quite persuasive.

30:30.999 --> 30:35.692
Yes, you better be. Because Isis
is the only one that can bring
Phoebe back.

30:35.792 --> 30:40.542
If my love doesn't get what she
wants, yours will stay wrapped
up forever.

30:41.876 --> 30:45.859
It's done.
The rhyme is a tad childish,

30:45.959 --> 30:46.899
but it should work.

30:46.999 --> 30:50.876
Oh, good. All we need now is--

30:53.292 --> 30:54.859
The witch must have taken him.

30:54.959 --> 30:57.192
Oh, he'll be back.

30:57.292 --> 30:59.567
The important thing is...

30:59.667 --> 31:01.317
...we're alone.

31:01.417 --> 31:02.918
Isis.

31:10.209 --> 31:11.609
Well, I guess I should've
seen this coming.

31:11.709 --> 31:14.899
I want my sisters
back now, Cole.

31:14.999 --> 31:17.776
Or what?

31:17.876 --> 31:19.567
You got nothing, Piper.

31:19.667 --> 31:21.999
You can't even vanquish me.

31:24.209 --> 31:25.834
Doesn't mean I won't try.

31:26.999 --> 31:30.042
Okay, if that's the way
you want to play it...

31:34.042 --> 31:35.900
Ah. Impressive.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.999
Wait.

31:39.417 --> 31:41.501
[GRUNTING]

31:57.125 --> 31:59.818
Isis...

31:59.918 --> 32:02.234
...should we be doing this?

32:02.334 --> 32:04.942
It's my body now.

32:05.042 --> 32:08.334
No, I mean,
how are you feeling?

32:09.792 --> 32:12.334
I love that you care.

32:30.959 --> 32:32.651
Oh, no.

32:34.334 --> 32:36.025
Isis.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.584
Not yet.

32:46.459 --> 32:50.192
Hey. What are you guys doing?
You're both invincible.

32:50.292 --> 32:53.125
This is just pointless.

32:58.751 --> 33:01.317
The man's got a point, Piper.
The sooner we stop this,

33:01.417 --> 33:03.626
the sooner you can save
one of your sisters.

33:04.626 --> 33:06.359
What do you mean, one?

33:06.459 --> 33:09.899
I mean that you're gonna
have to choose between them,

33:09.999 --> 33:12.125
and if you don't,
they'll both die.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.900
Why? Are you gonna kill them?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.567
No, I'm not gonna do anything.

33:18.667 --> 33:19.942
The cards have
already been dealt.

33:20.042 --> 33:22.359
I'm just giving you
guys your options.

33:22.459 --> 33:26.125
You're delusional if you think
I'm gonna choose between my
sisters.

33:30.167 --> 33:34.067
Am I? Isis is the only one
who knows how to revive Phoebe.

33:34.167 --> 33:37.484
She's not gonna do that
unless you cast a spell

33:37.584 --> 33:40.776
to eject Paige's spirit
from her body.

33:40.876 --> 33:43.067
I won't do that.
Paige would die.

33:43.167 --> 33:44.526
Fine.

33:44.626 --> 33:46.776
Then eject Isis' spirit instead.

33:46.876 --> 33:49.442
But, of course, you'd be saving
Paige and killing Phoebe,

33:49.542 --> 33:51.317
because without Isis...

33:51.417 --> 33:53.900
...there's no way to revive her.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.317
LEO:
What about Jeric?

33:55.417 --> 33:57.484
He mummifies,
can't he de-mummify?

33:57.584 --> 34:00.067
He traps spirits. He doesn't
bring bodies back to life.

34:00.167 --> 34:01.709
That's Isis' job.

34:02.459 --> 34:03.899
So...

34:03.999 --> 34:07.401
...of course, as you can see,
you...

34:07.501 --> 34:09.458
...have to make a choice.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.208
You sick bastard.

34:14.501 --> 34:16.918
I can't choose, and I won't.

sister?

34:34.708 --> 34:36.275
You didn't grow up
with her or anything.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.609
You've only known her for
like a year and a half, right?

34:38.708 --> 34:40.317
So compared to Phoebe,
she's like...

34:40.417 --> 34:42.000
...a stranger.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.734
She's still my sister.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.818

34:48.918 --> 34:50.609
There is no other way.

for one, they'll both die.

both die either.

How can I be so powerful and
so helpless at the same time?

Well, Piper, your strength...

36:05.999 --> 36:08.999
...isn't in your invincibility.

have to call Cole back soon...

We're having a day of beauty.

40:34.834 --> 40:36.900
I'm showing Paige
how to pamper herself.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.651
You're beauteous.

40:38.751 --> 40:41.734
I'm getting quite good at it.
I like it. It's free.

40:41.834 --> 40:43.818
Well, I'm glad. It's about time.

40:43.918 --> 40:46.067
It is, isn't it?
I've been so long overdue,

40:46.167 --> 40:48.899
- I'm so put upon, really.
- PIPER: Wow.

40:48.999 --> 40:53.401
Turn a girl into an Egyptian
princess for a day and look what
happens.

40:53.501 --> 40:56.900
By the way, Lieutenant Morris
called to say thank you.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.899
Oh, he got his promotion.
That's so great.

41:00.999 --> 41:04.417
Apparently, he got credit for
the arrest, despite Leo's little
jailbreak.

41:05.999 --> 41:07.776
What you got there?

41:07.876 --> 41:10.526
Maternity clothes,
as if you didn't know already.

41:10.626 --> 41:13.609
- You caved.
- Yes, the time has come.

41:13.709 --> 41:15.900
But I've come to the conclusion
that if you've got it...

41:16.000 --> 41:17.899
...then you must flaunt it.

41:17.999 --> 41:21.734
- That's my niece in that belly.
- She's my niece too.

41:21.834 --> 41:25.083
Hi, niece. It's your favorite,
Aunt Phoebe.
