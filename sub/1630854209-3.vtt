00:02.903 --> 00:04.138
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...
I ain't handing over nothing.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.539
My name is Regina Haywood.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.008
<i>A German tourist
and a security guard,</i>

00:08.109 --> 00:09.577
<i>murdered in broad daylight.</i>

00:09.677 --> 00:11.779
That is totally unacceptable.

00:11.879 --> 00:13.481
Nice to meet you,
Detective Morales.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.516
This is
Detective Killian.
Nice to meet you.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.518
I've been working
in restaurants since I'm 19.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.153
I want to own that place.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.154
The joint's yours.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.991
All right, Bentley,
your first crime scene.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.494
Hey, Sandeford,
who are those guys?

00:26.594 --> 00:28.629
Chief Suarez.
He's the borough commander.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.998
You asked for Stan Yenko
to be your executive officer?

00:31.099 --> 00:33.334
I irritate people.
I know this about myself.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.369
I also want members
of the service

00:35.469 --> 00:36.870
<i>to start living near
where they work.</i>

00:36.970 --> 00:38.372
Why'd you volunteer
to do this, Quinlan?

00:38.472 --> 00:40.141
Because I think
this is a good idea.

00:40.241 --> 00:43.511
We, all together, are going to
stem this kind of violence

00:43.611 --> 00:45.546

01:20.748 --> 01:23.016

Tenants reported hearing
them drive east.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.365
What do we have?

01:37.465 --> 01:38.599
Drive-by.
Three shot, one fatality.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.900
Name's Junior Hunter.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.369
Any word on a next
of kin who can ID?

01:41.469 --> 01:42.903
We're on it.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.672
Tenants say he lived
in the Blaylock Houses alone.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.106
What about the perps?

01:46.207 --> 01:47.408
Two on a scooter.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.876
No one's ID'd them yet.
But whatever

01:48.976 --> 01:50.644
the guy was using,
sounded like a machine gun.

01:51.679 --> 01:52.680
You're not gonna do nothing.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.382
Sir, I'm trying to do something

01:54.482 --> 01:55.716
which is why I'm asking you,

01:55.816 --> 01:57.318
have you ever seen
the shooter before.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.419
Uh...

01:58.519 --> 01:59.653
Any beefs going on you know of?

01:59.753 --> 02:01.322
Any beefs?

02:01.422 --> 02:02.623
Pick one.
There's plenty of beefs.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.592
That's the nature of things.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.794
But you don't know
who it was between?
No.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.796
What about the scooter?
Can you describe the scooter?

02:08.896 --> 02:11.064
I'm gonna say Yamaha 'cause it
looked like one my nephew has.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.333
Color?

02:12.433 --> 02:13.967
Red.
With a white X on it.

02:14.067 --> 02:14.968
Did you see his face?

02:15.068 --> 02:16.036
How am I gonna see the shooter

02:16.136 --> 02:16.970
if his face is covered up?

02:17.070 --> 02:17.938
He had a mask on.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.072
How am I gonna describe him?

02:19.173 --> 02:20.441
I keep my nose clean, sir.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.376
I'm a businessman.
Oh, what kind of business?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.512
Accessory devices
for the urban lifestyle--

02:24.612 --> 02:26.414
cell phone cases,
messenger bags,

02:26.514 --> 02:28.148
repair screens,
you know, whatever.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.184
I do it all.
Now what?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.753
I found this over
by the tire tracks.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.189
Oh, that, my friends,
is a Glock switch.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.424
Why it sounded like
a machine gun.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.459
Oh, for the days of a .38.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.394
All right. I want a list of
all the tenants,

02:40.494 --> 02:41.862
any gang affiliations.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.631
Also, let's make sure we dump
security camera footage

02:43.731 --> 02:45.666
from those cameras
and whatever working...

02:45.766 --> 02:47.335
Central, get aviation over here

02:47.435 --> 02:48.702
at the Blaylock Houses.

02:48.802 --> 02:49.903
We got airmail coming off
from the roof,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.572
building 6.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.608
You got to go now, Inspector.
No, no, no.
We'll figure it out.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.211
Whoa, whoa!

02:59.012 --> 03:00.248
Everybody good?

03:00.348 --> 03:01.449
You okay, Inspector?

03:01.549 --> 03:02.616
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.951
I want to take that roof.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.653
No, no, no. You--
Let us do it. You take off.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.187
I'm not taking off!
I'm going in with my people.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.768
Which one threw the concrete?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.637
Yellow shirt.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.047
You want to kill me, son?

03:42.590 --> 03:44.224
Bring them in.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.226
Everybody goes through!

03:57.538 --> 03:59.773
♪ Oh... ♪

04:01.409 --> 04:03.644
Are you familiar with
a Glock switch, Chief?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
I am.
It's amazingly
simple, really.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.349
Takes a semiautomatic,
makes it fully automatic.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.984
Can shoot 30 rounds
in 2.3 seconds.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.386
Stan, he said
he's familiar with it.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.587
No, no, no, of course. Absolutely.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.622
I'm just always admiring

04:14.722 --> 04:16.690
the ingenuity
of the human mind.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.292
They're generally
made of metal, though.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.461
This one looks like
it's plastic.

04:20.561 --> 04:21.829
We think made in a 3D printer.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.864
In all likelihood,
that's probably why it broke.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.934
But it let them shoot up that
whole courtyard before it broke.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.902
Look, since
what they were using

04:29.002 --> 04:30.404
is basically a machine gun,

04:30.504 --> 04:32.740
and machine guns
are prohibited by federal law,

04:32.840 --> 04:34.007
this gets ATF involved.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.976
We want ATF involved?

04:36.076 --> 04:38.245
ATF comes with
federal resources--

04:38.346 --> 04:39.880
overtime, technical support.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.082
More crime, more resources.

04:42.182 --> 04:45.686
That's not exactly the way
I intended on getting them.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.987
Give us a minute, yeah?

04:47.087 --> 04:48.389
Yeah, sure.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.326
So, vertical patrols?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.127
Is that something
you're intending on

04:54.227 --> 04:55.829
making a regular
thing now, Regina?

04:55.929 --> 04:58.766
I'm glad to see you came all
the way down to check in on me.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.601
Well, it's what I do,

05:00.701 --> 05:03.036
especially when I have
a deputy inspector

05:03.136 --> 05:04.772
still move around
like she's a street cop.

05:04.872 --> 05:08.308
Is that something I can't do
as commanding officer?

05:08.409 --> 05:09.977
I'm not here to say
what you can or can't do.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.780
I just want to remind you it's
a lot tougher doing your job

05:12.880 --> 05:15.749
from a hospital bed.
I can't show the cops
and the community

05:15.849 --> 05:17.885
I care about them
from behind my desk

05:17.985 --> 05:20.020
all the time.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.323
There was an old man
who was murdered today.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.494
I don't know if the guys
on the roof are connected,

05:26.594 --> 05:30.598
but if it takes almost
getting clocked, I got to do it.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.934
Right?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.744
All right, now bag it
as we go, all right?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.145
Name.
Come on.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.482
Name!
Steven Turner.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.484
Yo, I got to pee.
When we get to do that?

05:50.584 --> 05:51.752
Yeah, as soon as
we're done here.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.086
Yo, when we get
something to eat?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.021
Same thing.
Date of birth?

05:54.121 --> 05:55.222
10-12-2002.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.390
Vouchering.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.426
Key ring, five keys,

05:58.526 --> 06:01.595
a blue plastic pen,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.330
three one-dollar bills.
Let's go.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.565
Yeah, he had a lot more
than that on him.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.299
All right. Next.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.535
These cuffs is hurting.
Quinlan, make sure

06:07.635 --> 06:08.969
they take his belt
and shoelaces.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.438
Oh, so I don't hang up?

06:10.538 --> 06:11.805
Yeah, something like that.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.373
Name.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.942
Vincent West.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.277
Date of birth.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.047
04-10-2006.
Hold on, hold on.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.549
Hey!

06:21.649 --> 06:24.251
I told you guys, settle down

06:24.351 --> 06:25.586
so we can get through this!

06:25.686 --> 06:27.054
Thank you.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.956
All right.
Date of birth.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.459
04-10-2006.
16.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.427
They get younger by the day.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.062
You have to take
my crackers, bro?
Quiet.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.097
Vouchering.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.466
Key ring, four keys on it.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.968
Do I get my crackers back?

06:41.735 --> 06:42.703
Bon appétit.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.305
All right, next.
Come on.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.775
Hey, hey. Relax.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.043
Only working camera.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.345
Barely.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.648
That's Lindsey Boston.
I interviewed her.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.450
There's Mercedes No-Last-Name.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.651
I interviewed her.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.553
Celia Malone. I interviewed her.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.755
Oh, and there's Junior Hunter.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.357
With four minutes
and 32 seconds to live.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.259
Weird.
What?

07:06.359 --> 07:08.496
I mean, at some point,

07:08.596 --> 07:11.565
we all have four minutes
and 32 seconds to live, right?

07:11.665 --> 07:13.634
That's pretty heavy, Tomas.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.003
Never mind. I'm never
saying another word. Mm.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.370
There's a motor scooter.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.640
No plates, of course.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.141
Too blurry to ID

07:21.241 --> 07:24.011
the two on it.
No tattoos we can see.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.913
Dark clothes.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.515
Hey, there's D-Flawless.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.116
You're making that up.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.450
It's what he calls himself.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.752
His real name's
Demonté Green.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.286
And he says
he's a businessman.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.622
He's coming out
of the building right here.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.156
That's when the shooting starts.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.658
Look at that.
What do you know?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.827
Maybe your D-Flawless there
was the intended target.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.630
Yet he told me he wasn't
aware of any beef.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.364
Hate to think he would've lied.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.567
Makes me fear
for the republic.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.001
Hmm.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.670
Hey, hey.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.609
Deputy Mayor Sharpe.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.078
I apologize, Inspector.
Some people have

07:58.178 --> 07:59.513
no sense of
common courtesy.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.881
My apologies, Captain Yenko,

08:00.981 --> 08:03.450
but Belle Lacey
serves as a liaison

08:03.551 --> 08:05.152
between my office and
public housing. I wanted

08:05.252 --> 08:07.420
to see to it she had the
opportunity to speak with you.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.657
She lives in the
Blaylock Houses.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.492
Did you know Mr. Hunter?

08:12.593 --> 08:15.062
Everybody knew Mr. Hunter. Devastating.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.597
Did Junior Hunter
have any family?

08:16.697 --> 08:19.933
We do want
to notify next of kin. Yeah.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.301
A sister in Shreveport.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.936
I believe she passed.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.738
All right.
We can find out.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.541
If you have any difficulty,
I'm sure my office can.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.476
Mr. Hunter was my friend.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.378
Very important living
in public housing

08:31.478 --> 08:32.713
to know who your friends are.

08:32.813 --> 08:36.083
Absolutely.
He was a friend to me.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.886
He was a friend to my grandson.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.988
Okay. Your grandson is...?

08:41.088 --> 08:42.556
Vincent... West.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.857
He's one of the kids that
was arrested this morning.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.559
He had nothing

08:45.659 --> 08:47.060
to do with what happened
to Mr. Hunter.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.163
But he did throw a chunk
of concrete at a police officer.

08:50.263 --> 08:53.801
There may have been another way
to respond to that, Inspector.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.303
Vincent has always
stayed out of trouble.

08:56.403 --> 08:59.840
If you give him a record, you
will mess up his life forever.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.611
Ms. Lacey, I suggest
you get a lawyer for Vincent.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.946
If you can't afford one...
of course I can't afford one.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.315
...one will be appointed
by the court.

09:08.415 --> 09:09.983
When my other grandson
was arrested,

09:10.083 --> 09:13.453
I was able to pick him up
from family court the same day.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.789
Did your other grandson
also try to kill cops?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.291
Oh.
This is what
we're trying to achieve

09:18.391 --> 09:20.093
with the Safe Streets Initiative.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.494
We take the energy
and anger

09:21.595 --> 09:22.830
found in these
young people,

09:22.930 --> 09:25.165
and we redirect it
into a constructive

09:25.265 --> 09:26.533
and sustaining purpose.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.135
I don't know about all of that.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.873
My grandson is not the kind
of kid you have to arrest.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.142
Well, he's about to figure out
what kind of man he wants

09:35.242 --> 09:39.847
to become because he is not
leaving here any time soon.

09:39.947 --> 09:43.550
I'm sorry, but that's about all
I can do for you today.

09:43.651 --> 09:46.119
Guilty until proven otherwise?

09:46.219 --> 09:47.855
We had every reason
to arrest him.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.757
It's up to the courts
to adjudicate

09:49.857 --> 09:52.660
whether he's guilty
or not guilty.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.965
I thought you were some kind
of different.

09:58.065 --> 10:03.403
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.608
Check back with us
this afternoon.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.343
I'll be right with you, Belle.

10:11.444 --> 10:15.148
DOAs from a modified firearm
don't look too good at COMPSTAT.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.416
I'm aware of that, Mr. Sharpe.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.085
What I wish you were aware of is

10:18.185 --> 10:19.586
that I'm an asset to you.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.121
I could help you
with the mayor,

10:21.221 --> 10:23.657
I could help you with
a variety of people.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.859
It's called
setting up for success.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.731
Captain.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.835
From now on,
nobody gets back here

10:34.935 --> 10:38.471
without clearance from
the front desk, especially him.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.210
Got it.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.389
♪ I'm good with the strangers ♪

10:56.489 --> 10:58.591
♪ I'm watching what come
with this paper ♪

10:58.692 --> 11:00.093
♪ You can love it
or hate it... ♪

11:00.193 --> 11:01.361
I'm trying to remember
at what point

11:01.461 --> 11:03.063
in my childhood dreams
did I see myself

11:03.163 --> 11:04.932
one day spending
endless nights

11:05.032 --> 11:07.267
assembling chairs.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.837
These are flat boxes, too.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.940
The flatter the boxes,
the more pieces to put together.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.208
You need to buy chairs
in chair-shaped boxes.

11:15.308 --> 11:19.079
Right.
Hey, honey, Crystal.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.681
Hey.
Thought you were
coming by after work.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.018
Yeah, I'm just, um,
dropping off these chairs.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.820
Oh, I know
it doesn't look it,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.188
but it is really
coming together.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.257
It's going to be
so great, Tommy.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.725
Yeah? Who are all
these tough guys?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.961
Oh, I hired a chef.
Those are his people.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.362
Oh. Who'd you get?

11:35.462 --> 11:37.697
Oh, he's great.
He's got his own crew

11:37.798 --> 11:39.132
and a huge following
of loyal customers

11:39.232 --> 11:41.201
that'll follow him here.
Yeah. Who is he?

11:41.301 --> 11:42.369
You know how they do
all kinds of food

11:42.469 --> 11:44.237
in McCarren Park
on the weekends?

11:44.337 --> 11:46.006
He's been doing that
and got written about.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.674
The <i>Times</i> had a thing on him.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.509
<i>The New Yorker</i>
had a thing on him.
Yeah. Yeah.

11:49.609 --> 11:50.878
Does he have a name, Corinne?

11:50.978 --> 11:52.479
George Pappas.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.650
You got any of those
write-ups on him?

11:57.751 --> 12:00.353
Yeah, on my phone,
but you know.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.389
May I see them, please?

12:05.625 --> 12:06.760
Okay.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.364
Tommy, I don't want you
doing a background check on him.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.033
I know there's things
in his past.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.941
Yeah, I don't have
to do a background check on him.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.943
I locked him up.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.677
Seriously?
Mm-hmm. Possession

12:24.778 --> 12:27.114
of Schedule A narcotics
with intent to distribute,

12:27.214 --> 12:29.349
possession of illegal firearm, burglary.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.252
He said he'd been to prison.
He didn't try to hide it.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.854
Yeah, all the people
in New York.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.755
How many people in New York now?
Yeah. Don't put me into this.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.590
This is the one guy
you could find to cook?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.226
No, this is the best guy
I could find.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.627
And you just said,
he's done his time.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.062
He's a different person
now, right?

12:42.162 --> 12:43.931
People change, Tommy.
Oh, do they?

12:44.031 --> 12:46.533
'Cause that's not my experience.
Crystal, that's your experience?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.635
I'm not even here right now.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.104
Well, they don't, okay?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.739
People are who they are.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.142
He was a skel when I locked him
up, and he's still a skel.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.110
Well, he's a skel
who works for me now,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.012
so you're just going
to have to trust

12:59.112 --> 13:01.148
that I know what I'm doing.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.116
Hmm.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.553
Yeah.

13:14.061 --> 13:16.163
<i>Inspector, you're not going
to believe this.</i>

13:16.263 --> 13:17.397
What's going on?

13:17.497 --> 13:18.665
Building maintenance
is scheduled

13:18.765 --> 13:20.333
to visit
regarding the female showers.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.735
Well, how long have the
female showers been down now?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.838
Oh, too long.
I've been saying for years,

13:24.938 --> 13:28.208
they should repurpose
the men's showers to accommodate

13:28.308 --> 13:31.011
the female officers, but
as you can imagine, it's not

13:31.111 --> 13:32.345
a very popular opinion.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.613
Like most of my opinions,

13:33.713 --> 13:35.048
it just falls
through the cracks,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.516
only to be resurrected
by someone

13:36.616 --> 13:38.318
who wants to claim them
as their own.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.420
Inspector, Captain.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.821
Uh, we have all the arrestees

13:41.922 --> 13:43.656
from the raid en route
to Central Booking.

13:43.756 --> 13:47.527
Uh, Vincent West, however,
is a minor, still in holding.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.196
Any reason why
you want to keep him?

13:49.296 --> 13:51.498
His grandmother thinks
he's a little angel.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.033
Oh, I doubt even his grandmother
thinks that.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.403
I want to give her and him
the benefit of the doubt.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.938
No, of course.
Although, that's

13:58.038 --> 14:01.208
generally left up to the
judicial branch of government.

14:02.009 --> 14:06.413
If we have the power of offering
someone another path in life,

14:06.513 --> 14:09.449
I have to be open to doing it.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.755
Mind if I, uh,
take a crack at talking to him?

14:16.890 --> 14:18.391
Not in a <i>Scared Straight!</i>
approach,

14:18.491 --> 14:19.927
but, you know, mention

14:20.027 --> 14:21.761
that his friends
aren't really ones to keep.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.763
Go ahead.

14:26.799 --> 14:30.137
♪ Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah... ♪

14:31.939 --> 14:33.440
♪ Work, work ♪

14:33.540 --> 14:36.643
♪ And go and get that bonus,
work, work... ♪

14:36.743 --> 14:39.779
Detective Killian, right?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.782
Very good.
This is Detective Morales. Welcome.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.117
Meet my girlfriend...

14:44.217 --> 14:45.852
uh, my fiancée Jasmine.

14:45.953 --> 14:47.387
We're just finishing
with lunch here.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.455
Hi.
Hey.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
Is everything okay?

14:50.490 --> 14:51.591
I thought I told you.

14:51.691 --> 14:52.892
Remember the situation
that happened?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.094
Oh, yeah.
Everything's gonna be fine.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.728
See you tonight?

14:55.828 --> 14:58.698
I'll see you later. Okay.
Okay. Bye.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.133
Bye.
Bye.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.170
So we just wanted to, uh,

15:03.270 --> 15:05.272
catch you up
on our investigation

15:05.372 --> 15:07.774
of the shooting.
Thank you, but it's unnecessary.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.409
Well, maybe.
I mean, but we had a chance

15:09.509 --> 15:11.411
to look at the security footage,

15:11.511 --> 15:13.613
and it looks like
the shooter started shooting

15:13.713 --> 15:16.316
when you came out
of the building. Mm.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.717
Was that a coincidence?

15:17.817 --> 15:20.620
Coincidence, mistaken identity.

15:20.720 --> 15:21.788
You know.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.523
It's hard to say these days.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.225
Pretty impressive
how you set yourself up in here

15:25.325 --> 15:26.726
in your little pop-up shop.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.861
Yeah, until they chase me out
of here, right?

15:28.962 --> 15:30.697
Mm.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.000
I'm impressed you learned
to repair computer screens.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.535
Did you, uh, do that
while you were locked up?

15:36.369 --> 15:38.638
Yes, I did. Mm.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.542
One of the pillars of success
is to strive for knowledge.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.677
I learned a lot of things
when I was inside.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.679
Everything except not to lie.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.381
Well, maybe lying's one
of those other pillars.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.984
Mm.
Hey, listen.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.585
I'm a businessman, not a liar.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.187
I wouldn't lie to you guys.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.189
Put yourself
in our place, Demonté.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.590
All right, these guys tried
to kill you.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.260
They still might.
Yet, you won't give 'em up.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.894
Now why would that be
the case except

16:01.995 --> 16:03.630
you got something to hide?

16:03.730 --> 16:06.733
A lot of success in business
is reputation of the brand.

16:06.833 --> 16:07.934
Now,

16:08.035 --> 16:09.202
maybe it wouldn't benefit

16:09.302 --> 16:12.872
my brand if I was seen
as a snitch.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.941
You get where
I'm going with that?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.676
I think he's sticking
with his story.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.445
Good luck, Demonté.
Hope it all works out for you.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.013
I'm sorry.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.449
What's up? Talk to me.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.284
Yeah, I can put
that order in for you

16:24.384 --> 16:25.385
as early as tonight.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.653
Uh-huh.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.355
"Demonté Green.
I do everything."

16:28.455 --> 16:30.290
Hey, Crystal.
How many units were
you looking to order?

16:30.390 --> 16:31.758
It's a 3D printer.

16:31.858 --> 16:32.892
Hey, Demonté?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.394
Leaving you
ten bucks for one

16:34.494 --> 16:36.063
of these handsome
blue phone cases.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.040
Thanks. Ask for
Officer Marvin Sandeford

16:47.140 --> 16:48.375
if you call the precinct.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.942
Any luck?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.744
No. Doctor's office only
had a neighbor listed

16:51.844 --> 16:53.513
as his emergency contact.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.415
What happens if no next of kin
claims Junior Hunter's body?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.184
Then they'll
cremate him.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.619
To grow old and alone.
Couldn't be me.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.221
Then make a plan.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.555
Oh, yeah?
What's your plan?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.157
Doesn't matter
what my plan is.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.992
What's mine
might not work for you.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.994
<i>Tell me why
I should give you this warrant.</i>

17:08.095 --> 17:10.763
We think Demonté Green
was the intended target

17:10.863 --> 17:12.832
of the shooting that
killed Junior Hunter.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.367
Being the intended target
doesn't

17:14.467 --> 17:15.735
get you probable cause
to search.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.471
Oh, that's not
what we're saying, Seth.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.872
Are you familiar
with what a Glock switch does?

17:19.972 --> 17:22.109
I know all about it.
A semiautomatic

17:22.209 --> 17:23.676
into a fully automatic weapon.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.745
Can fire off 30 rounds
in two seconds.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.347
Stan, he said
he's familiar.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.882
This was manufactured and sold

17:29.982 --> 17:31.351
by Demonté Green.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.520
Made on a 3D printer exactly
like the one in his shop.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.022
What I can see here is
that they're both blue.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.725
The same blue,
in the same material made

17:38.825 --> 17:41.027
with a polymer resin
not commonly available.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.829
But available.
And Demonté Green

17:42.929 --> 17:44.531
lives in the same apartment
building with his fiancée

17:44.631 --> 17:45.865
where the shooting occurred.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.500
And where shootings
occur weekly.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.001
Outside of which
the Glock switch was found.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.337
Come on, Seth!

17:50.437 --> 17:52.139
Judges are like toddlers.
They love the word "no."

17:52.239 --> 17:53.973
They love to argue,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.509
and the threshold
for some of them is way high.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.511
The glove compartment
was closed,

17:58.611 --> 18:00.413
so the pound and a half
of fentanyl doesn't come in.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.282
The laundry room extension
wasn't specified on the warrant,

18:02.382 --> 18:04.817
so the sawed-off shotgun
doesn't come in.
Yeah, but

18:04.917 --> 18:07.554
you bring it to the right judge,
and you take the totality

18:07.654 --> 18:09.189
of those factors
and put 'em together.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.090
I don't want maybe, Stan.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.659
I don't want close calls.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.093
I don't want to stand there

18:14.194 --> 18:15.928
and have some defense attorney
smirking at me

18:16.028 --> 18:18.631
because some
Ruth Bader Ginsburg wannabe

18:18.731 --> 18:21.768
is telling me my showing for
probable cause is insufficient,

18:21.868 --> 18:23.636
that I have been judged
and found wanting.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.205
I don't want
to go through that.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.374
So how about this
for a hypothetical?

18:27.474 --> 18:31.077
A gunman with a modified nine
millimeter rakes a schoolyard

18:31.178 --> 18:33.513
with hundreds of rounds
of ammunition?

18:33.613 --> 18:36.449
The means of modification
was easily available

18:36.549 --> 18:40.387
and known to the Kings County
District Attorney's Office,

18:40.487 --> 18:43.623
which did nothing
to prevent it.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.329
Get us the search warrant, Seth.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.097
For Green's apartment

18:51.198 --> 18:54.167
and the pop-up shop
for the Glock switches.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.668
You'll sleep better.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.540
Let's go!
♪ Stay ready ♪

19:00.640 --> 19:01.774
♪ And you ain't
gotta get ready ♪

19:01.874 --> 19:03.243
♪ While people talkin' ♪

19:04.744 --> 19:07.614
♪ Get the fetty,
never speak about it ♪

19:07.714 --> 19:09.115
♪ 'Cause you're too busy
walkin' ♪

19:09.216 --> 19:12.652
♪ Keep it steady, keep it
low step, light beat... ♪

19:12.752 --> 19:15.087
Wait a minute. What the
hell are guys doing?!

19:15.188 --> 19:16.356
That Jasmine?
Yes, it's Jasmine.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.225
Why are you wrecking my house?

19:18.325 --> 19:21.528
Let her in.
These are my clothes.
These are all of my things.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.996
Jasmine, right now, I'm going to
have to ask you to stand aside.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.998
So you just go through
all my things like this?

19:26.098 --> 19:28.768
We have a search warrant
for these premises, Jasmine.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.169
It says Demonté Green
lives here,

19:30.270 --> 19:31.338
and we can conduct a search.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.805
If you interfere
with that search,

19:32.905 --> 19:34.307
you'll be arrested.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.276
I suggest you take a seat.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.512
So you're gonna arrest me
for coming into my own house?

19:39.612 --> 19:41.381
Hey, where you going with that?
Just dump it.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.815
I'm not gonna dump it.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.251
I'm gonna go sift
through it in the kitchen.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.452
This is somebody's house.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.953
Wait. Did...?

19:47.053 --> 19:50.357
I can't believe
you guys are doing this.

19:50.457 --> 19:53.393
Self-help, philosophy,
war strategy.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.662
Quite a collection.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.665
Well, he said he got
an education in the joint.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.303
Whoa.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.376
Glock switches.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.879
Are you planning
on going to war, Jasmine?

20:20.653 --> 20:21.921
I don't know nothing
about Demonté's business.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.423
This ain't on me.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.825
The problem is,
this apartment is in your name.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.294
I know it's in my name.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.028
That's why I got to go
to Housing Authority

20:29.128 --> 20:30.463
and tell 'em why
it's all busted up.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.799
Bigger problems at the moment.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.568
It means that you're the one
that's going to get charged

20:35.668 --> 20:36.936
for those switches.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.505
That ain't right.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.106
I didn't say it was right.

20:40.206 --> 20:42.509
All right, they took down
his store, but he wasn't there.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.679
Mm. So, Jasmine,
your one shot is,

20:46.779 --> 20:48.648
you just tell us
where to find them.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.987
Mr. Businessman.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.357
He went to get his mail.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.496
You got my number, right? Okay.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.432
This is my favorite part.

21:05.532 --> 21:08.067
That flash in the eyes
when, for a second,

21:08.167 --> 21:09.669
they think about running.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.704
Oh, there he goes.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.141
It's the shoes, man.
Come on, up.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.676
It's why they don't have

21:16.776 --> 21:18.711
any foot pursuits
on Wall Street.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.515
Hey, Killian, look what came
special delivery.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.752
Resin for the printer.
Hey, I don't know
what that is. Listen.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.488
Somebody at the Seal-N-Ship
is gonna hear from me.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.022
All right, come on.
Let's go, pal.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.458
Can I get my shoe?

21:31.558 --> 21:34.527
What's up, Sarge?

21:36.429 --> 21:38.465
I don't know why I said
I'd speak to this kid.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.800
Well, sucking up to the C.O.'s
as good a reason as any.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.436
Maybe I felt like I had
something to say to him.

21:43.536 --> 21:46.172
And now?
I don't know where to start.

21:46.272 --> 21:49.241
Can I offer some suggestions?

21:49.342 --> 21:51.678
Please.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.220
Okay.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.529
Detective.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.398
You know,
I don't usually like to go back

22:11.498 --> 22:13.800
into the kitchen
of places where I eat.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.568
You know,
things you see there can just

22:15.668 --> 22:17.203
make you lose your appetite.

22:17.303 --> 22:18.605
Corinne's not here right now.

22:18.705 --> 22:21.408
Oh, Corinne? Oh, no.
I know she's not here.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.377
Yeah, um, I'm aware
of her general comings

22:24.477 --> 22:26.513
and goings
because we live together.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.848
Which is also why
I take a keen interest

22:28.948 --> 22:30.883
in her welfare
while I'm on my investigations.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.519
I understand your concern.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.955
Do you? Oh, well,
that is a huge weight off.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.924
So the menu you're preparing--

22:38.024 --> 22:40.326
is it gonna feature
Salisbury steak and fruit cup?

22:40.427 --> 22:44.030
You know, since my release,

22:44.130 --> 22:46.699
I graduated from the
Culinary Institute of America.

22:46.799 --> 22:50.136
Oh. And now you cook
at a cop bar.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.204
Corinne really...

22:52.304 --> 22:55.041
Stop... saying her name.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.876
She hired me to work here.

23:00.179 --> 23:04.083
Your boss-- my girlfriend--
she's not like most people.

23:04.183 --> 23:07.520
She's good, and the only thing
she's not smart about is

23:07.620 --> 23:09.221
thinking that
most other people are, too.

23:09.321 --> 23:12.291
But you and I--
we know different.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.193
Which is why
I'm gonna have to ask you

23:14.293 --> 23:15.795
to tender your resignation

23:15.895 --> 23:18.631
immediately... Chef.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.833
What's going on?

23:24.036 --> 23:26.105
The detective was just inquiring
about the menu.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.441
Yeah.
Demonté's gone
through processing.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.976
You should come back.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.512
Yeah, I'll be right there.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.881
Hey, sweetie. Hey.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.383
Yeah.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.857
So, Vincent,
what do you think happens

23:44.957 --> 23:47.494
when you and your friends
do stupid things?

23:47.594 --> 23:49.762
Worse thing
that happens is I go to juvie.

23:50.897 --> 23:51.998
What about after that?

23:52.098 --> 23:53.566
I was thinking Harvard.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.970
Oh, if he doesn't care,
then why should we, right?

23:58.771 --> 24:00.573
You know
what attempted murder is?

24:00.673 --> 24:01.874
I didn't try to murder no one.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.243
Yeah, but you threw that rock, right?

24:04.343 --> 24:06.045
Yeah.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.847
So you tried to murder someone.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.718
You know how juvie isn't worse

24:11.818 --> 24:14.921
than some places adults go,
like Rikers?

24:16.155 --> 24:19.025
Everyone in juvie's getting out.
Rikers?

24:20.059 --> 24:21.460
Maybe not.

24:23.996 --> 24:27.399
You want some tips...

24:27.500 --> 24:29.936
on how to make it
a little bit better?

24:30.036 --> 24:32.705
Don't look anyone
in the eye.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.174
Shower with your back to the
wall, and I bet someone told you

24:35.274 --> 24:38.310
that you have to show that
you're the baddest guy in there.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.146
Well, you know what?

24:40.246 --> 24:42.381
You better <i>be</i> the
baddest guy in there.

24:43.382 --> 24:46.653
Do you... do you think that
you're the baddest one in there?

24:46.753 --> 24:48.621
'Cause there can
only be one,

24:48.721 --> 24:50.456
and it's probably not you.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.760
Do as you are told.

24:53.860 --> 24:57.296
And I know it doesn't
come natural. Trust me.

24:57.396 --> 25:00.667
But just always do
what you are told.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.234
'Cause in school,
your teachers--

25:02.334 --> 25:04.370
they tell us to do something,
and we ignore them,

25:04.470 --> 25:06.839
'cause they can't
hurt us, but

25:06.939 --> 25:10.242
this is not that.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.945
And where you're going,

25:13.045 --> 25:15.548
your grandma can't
save your ass.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.421
Oh, is there anything
you'd like to add, Sergeant Kee?

25:24.156 --> 25:26.525
Um... bring a book?

25:26.626 --> 25:29.662
Yeah, that's good, too.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.642
This from your 3D printer?

25:42.742 --> 25:45.077
Okay.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.513
Yeah. That's what this is?

25:47.614 --> 25:49.616
Mm.
Yeah. I made this.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.184
Started off making toys
for kids.

25:52.284 --> 25:55.221
Yeah, like what?
Trucks, robots, toy guns?

25:55.321 --> 25:56.856
Parents couldn't afford
the ones at the store,

25:56.956 --> 25:59.158
so I used my machine
to copy them off,

25:59.258 --> 26:00.927
charged what
the parents can pay.

26:01.027 --> 26:03.462
Everybody wins.
That's my motto.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.664
You always use blue?
That's right.

26:04.764 --> 26:05.998
Blue's a popular color.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.900
You make anything besides toys?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.636
DEMONTÉ:
Yeah, after I did the toys,
I saw people need

26:09.736 --> 26:11.337
new phone cases for
their phone 'cause every time

26:11.437 --> 26:13.339
a new one comes out, they change
the size just a little bit.

26:13.439 --> 26:16.375
That's not right. People can't
afford that. My people

26:16.475 --> 26:17.476
can't afford that,

26:17.576 --> 26:18.577
so I fill
that need in.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.079
Yeah. Everybody wins.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.248
That's right.
What, is it a crime

26:22.348 --> 26:23.482
to make smartphone cases now?

26:23.582 --> 26:24.917
Hmm.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.886
No.

26:27.687 --> 26:31.758
But, uh, this is.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.327
What's that?

26:35.427 --> 26:37.363
You know what that is.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.031
Nah.

26:39.131 --> 26:42.401
Maybe some accoutrement
my little niece uses

26:42.501 --> 26:44.570
to make a necklace?

26:45.504 --> 26:48.775
You should have stuck to toys
and phone cases, Demonté.

26:48.875 --> 26:52.578
Because this?
Illegally modifying a firearm

26:52.679 --> 26:54.613
to make a machine gun?

26:54.714 --> 26:56.482
That's federal.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.485
Then why am I
sitting here

26:59.585 --> 27:01.220
talking to you?

27:01.320 --> 27:04.623
Because this is the last time
we see each other.

27:04.724 --> 27:08.661
Turns out federal-mandated
sentencing is 11 years...

27:08.761 --> 27:10.129
per switch.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.298
How many switches we find?

27:12.398 --> 27:13.933
25.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.268
So that's, like, 25 switches
times 11 years is, uh...

27:16.368 --> 27:17.503
What is that?

27:17.603 --> 27:18.905
I'd have to do it on paper.

27:19.005 --> 27:22.074
275 years.
Wow. He's quick.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.543
That's not even
factoring in whatever

27:24.643 --> 27:26.445
accessory to murder charges
come with the killing

27:26.545 --> 27:28.547
of that old man.
So before that happens,

27:28.647 --> 27:31.150
we need you to tell us

27:31.250 --> 27:34.186
who the guys were
that pulled the trigger.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.493
I do that, I walk?

27:41.593 --> 27:42.561
Whoa.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.696
You do it,

27:43.796 --> 27:45.364
and the D.A. might go

27:45.464 --> 27:47.233
for a reduced sentence.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.269
Substantially reduced.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.176
The guys who shot at me--
they made me

27:57.276 --> 27:59.245
make these switches
for them.
How'd they do that?

27:59.345 --> 28:01.180
They threaten you with a roll
of hundred-dollar bills?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.882
Yeah, and did they make you
do the other

28:02.982 --> 28:04.383
24 switches we found
at your apartment

28:04.483 --> 28:06.786
with your prints all over 'em?
Listen, I never wanted

28:06.886 --> 28:08.387
to be a part
of none of this, okay?

28:08.487 --> 28:09.722
I did my time.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.324
Just wanted to start a business.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.128
Help us understand
what happened, Demonté.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.998
Okay, I told 'em to use it
no more than three times.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.432
It's not metal.
A resin switch

28:20.532 --> 28:22.168
can't take
that kind of pressure.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.136
You can see the edges
are starting to melt here.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.437
They used the switch,

28:25.537 --> 28:26.873
it jammed,
one of their guys got dropped.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.075
They blamed me for it.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.176
That's ludicrous.

28:32.845 --> 28:35.347
Names and where to find them.

28:37.683 --> 28:39.786
Mario Sandoval.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.087
That's the one I know.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.755
He and his friend
Darren work

28:42.855 --> 28:44.590
at a parking garage
in downtown Brooklyn.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.092
That's where
I go to meet them.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.328
Should be one of those pillars
of success,

28:49.428 --> 28:51.831
huh, Demonté?

28:51.931 --> 28:54.867
"Get a second chance,
don't blow it"?

29:02.274 --> 29:04.710
I don't know why we have
a Twitter account.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.312
Just stirs people up.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.316
Uh, are Kee and Quinlan
with Vincent West right now?

29:10.416 --> 29:11.650
I'll find out.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.886
Listen, there's a,
uh, little memorial

29:13.986 --> 29:16.088
for Junior Hunter tonight
at Blaylock Houses.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.790
You inclined
on sending flowers or something?

29:17.890 --> 29:19.291
Send food, please,
and a lot of it.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.927
You got it. Hey.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.895
ATF is on their way
for a press conference.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.763
We're gonna lay out
what we confiscated?

29:24.864 --> 29:26.098
Uh-huh, and I want

29:26.198 --> 29:27.766
to have you up front on that.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.535
Okay? Not ATF.
Side by side--

29:29.635 --> 29:31.237
that's okay.
It's a partnership.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.839
I don't need
to read a statement, do I?

29:32.939 --> 29:34.506
I mean,
not if you don't want to.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.242
No, let ATF do that.
Is there someone

29:36.342 --> 29:38.510
who can check the array
of confiscated materials

29:38.610 --> 29:40.579
before the press office
gets here?
Well, not to toot

29:40.679 --> 29:43.015
my own horn, but I do know
what looks good on camera.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.984
You are a Renaissance man.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.685
I have been called a polymath,

29:46.785 --> 29:48.454
which, at the time, I think

29:48.554 --> 29:51.057
was complimentary.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.964
Hey.
Hey.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.966
Corrine,
what are you doing in here?

30:00.066 --> 30:02.068
I just came
to bring you dinner. Well,

30:02.168 --> 30:03.769
that's nice of you, but you
didn't have to bring it here.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.705
Tommy, look, I know
you're looking out for me.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.740
I'm lucky. I mean,
who's got their own cop, right?

30:08.841 --> 30:11.377
But you got to let me
make decisions for myself.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.113
Yeah, I make decisions, too,
Corinne. I make decisions

30:14.213 --> 30:16.983
about who people are and what
they're capable of all day long.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.484
That's what I get paid to do.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.920
Okay. Are you ever wrong?

30:21.020 --> 30:22.221
Not about this guy.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.890
He did his time.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.892
He did his parole.
He's got a slew of references.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.194
He's just trying
to make a legit living.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.395
He's trying, huh?

30:29.495 --> 30:30.829
So what? People try
all the time.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.364
We got a guy in a cell right now

30:32.464 --> 30:33.866
who came out of prison
with a whole business plan.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.301
Now he's going right back.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.404
Because the leopard
can't change its spots.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.972
You did.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.474
When?
After we met.

30:42.574 --> 30:45.044
You don't remember? I said "no"
about a hundred times.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.678
And people said I was nuts

30:46.778 --> 30:48.981
when I told them
I finally said "yes" to you.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.983
So I am asking you to trust me.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.685
And allow
for the possibility-- slim

30:53.785 --> 30:55.054
though it may be--

30:55.154 --> 30:57.323
that people can change.

30:57.423 --> 30:58.790
Just like you did.

30:58.891 --> 31:00.392
Plus, he's the only cook
I could afford.

31:00.492 --> 31:03.862
So which people said
you were nuts? Give me a name.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.798
Hey, Corinne. Hey.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.672
You got some dietary needs
I don't know about?
Stop.

31:13.772 --> 31:17.543
Come on. I got an address on
that garage where Mario works.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.811
After digging through
Mario's social media.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.880
There's even a photo
of his buddy Darren.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.316
Kids just got
to post everywhere they go.

31:24.416 --> 31:26.352

31:26.452 --> 31:28.988

31:30.556 --> 31:36.095
Afternoon. Detective Morales,
Killian from the 7-4.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.629
Anyone else working here today?

31:37.729 --> 31:39.198
No, just me.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.834
Come on.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.073
No one?
No.

31:47.173 --> 31:49.808
Mario, maybe?
No.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.843
You don't mind
if we take a look around?

32:00.119 --> 32:02.321
Hey, Mario down here?

32:03.755 --> 32:05.857
Mario!

32:08.961 --> 32:11.297
7-4 squad.
Shots fired.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.665
Parking garage,
Nassau and Bridge.
7-4 squad...

32:13.765 --> 32:15.534
Ready?
Go.

32:57.043 --> 33:00.279
Police! Don't move.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.614
Get on the ground.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.063
You said in the car
you didn't shoot anyone.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.065
'Cause I didn't.
You were on the scooter,
though, Darren.

33:19.165 --> 33:22.101
We got it all over
security camera footage.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.770
I didn't know nothing about what
Mario was going to do, though.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.105
Carrying a machine gun,

33:26.205 --> 33:27.573
you didn't know
what he was gonna do.

33:27.673 --> 33:28.707
He liked having it on him.

33:28.807 --> 33:31.677
It was like a good-luck charm.

33:31.777 --> 33:35.314
You knew he had beef
with Demonté Green.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.383
He was right to. Them switches

33:37.483 --> 33:39.418
cost $300 a piece,
two for $500.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.453
Mario gave Demonté
a rack for four.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.721
First one didn't fit.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.523
Second one gets jammed.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.459
Mario go to Demonté,
Demonté say, "Nah, man.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.628
You damaged it
if it don't fit in the gun."

33:49.728 --> 33:51.029
So, no refunds, no exchanges?

33:51.130 --> 33:52.864
And that ain't right.

33:52.964 --> 33:55.267
Then one of the boys
gets shot over it.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.535
Mario's cousin.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.104
What'd Demonté think
was gonna happen?

33:58.204 --> 34:01.340
He knew Mario wasn't going
to let that go.

34:01.440 --> 34:06.545
Too bad that old man
in the lawn chair didn't know.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.524
You want to put the divider up?

34:21.660 --> 34:23.395
Who's doing what?
Well, I figured

34:23.495 --> 34:25.731
you'd announce the confiscation,
and I'd announce the funding.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.266
So happens I have good news
about the funding.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.201
In addition to the money
from the federal government,

34:29.301 --> 34:30.502
the New Suffolk

34:30.602 --> 34:31.837
Restaurant
and Hospitality Group's

34:31.937 --> 34:33.439
kicking in a million-dollar

34:33.539 --> 34:35.040
discretionary fund.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.908
That will go a long way
towards Chief Haywood's goals

34:37.008 --> 34:39.811
of providing better community
relations in East New York.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.547
Giving credit where credit is
due, I'll be sure to mention

34:41.647 --> 34:42.948
that it's thanks in large part

34:43.048 --> 34:45.083
to the efforts
of Precinct Commander

34:45.184 --> 34:46.585
Regina Haywood.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.054
No.
What no?

34:49.155 --> 34:51.490
I don't care
what kind of deal you got

34:51.590 --> 34:52.858
with this restaurant group,
but I do not want

34:52.958 --> 34:54.793
Regina Haywood's name
connected with it.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.962
They're discretionary funds, John.

34:57.062 --> 35:00.266
She's not gonna get hurt
if she uses discretion.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.767
But you might,

35:01.867 --> 35:03.935
and she's gonna be expected
to take the hit for it.

35:04.035 --> 35:05.471
I have no such expectation.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.072
Let's leave her name out of it.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.018
What you just saw on that video

35:20.118 --> 35:22.120
is what a legal gun
is capable of

35:22.221 --> 35:24.122
when one of these parts
is attached to it.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.992
Till yesterday, if you wanted
to obtain that part, all you had

35:27.092 --> 35:30.061
to do is go and knock on the
apartment door of Demonté Green

35:30.162 --> 35:32.130
who would make one
from his 3D printer.

35:32.231 --> 35:35.701
What we have laid out on this
table here is what our officers

35:35.801 --> 35:37.236
confiscated from that apartment.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.770
So I want to thank the mayor,

35:38.870 --> 35:40.672
the assistant director
of field operations

35:40.772 --> 35:42.007
from ATF
and the police commissioner

35:42.107 --> 35:44.142
for supporting our efforts,
but I want to make

35:44.243 --> 35:46.945
special mention
to all of our friends at ATF

35:47.045 --> 35:48.747
for all of the help
that they gave us

35:48.847 --> 35:52.318
in getting that funding
to where it's most needed.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.453
Now Deputy Mayor Sharpe
has a couple of words to say

35:54.553 --> 35:56.755
on their behalf.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.459
Thank you.
This administration

36:00.559 --> 36:02.394
is committed to innovative,

36:02.494 --> 36:04.029
community-based policing.

36:04.129 --> 36:07.633
We stand behind our men
and women in blue 100%.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.869
And we believe
that a partnership between

36:10.969 --> 36:12.971
law enforcement
and the private sector is not

36:13.071 --> 36:15.140
only possible,
it's essential.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.443
It is therefore
my pleasure and privilege

36:17.543 --> 36:21.046
to introduce the Brooklyn Safe
Streets Initiative,

36:21.146 --> 36:23.515
funded both
by the federal government

36:23.615 --> 36:25.551
and with a million-dollar grant

36:25.651 --> 36:26.918
by an anonymous donor.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.721
Thank you.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.795
Thank you, Mayor.

36:44.069 --> 36:47.473
You want to see him
before family court?

36:47.573 --> 36:49.808
Let's go to my office.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.012
<i>Since you don't have a record,
I'm guessing</i>

36:54.112 --> 36:56.014
<i>this is your first time
in handcuffs?</i>

36:56.114 --> 36:57.516
Yes.

36:57.616 --> 36:58.984
When the day started,
you and me

36:59.084 --> 37:01.920
had no idea we would be
in each other's lives, did we?

37:02.020 --> 37:03.522
The end of mine almost,

37:03.622 --> 37:07.092
the end of yours
in a different way, too.

37:07.192 --> 37:08.594
And Mr. Hunter's.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.962
I liked Mr. Hunter.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.064
He gave me
a baseball glove he had.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.666
And now he's gone,

37:14.766 --> 37:17.336
and the young man
who killed him's gone,

37:17.436 --> 37:20.038
and the other young man
on the scooter's going to jail

37:20.138 --> 37:23.174
for a very long time,
and you're here in handcuffs,

37:23.275 --> 37:25.277
only 16 years old,

37:25.377 --> 37:28.814
and I'm wondering
what you make of all that.

37:32.117 --> 37:35.321
Why'd you throw that piece of
concrete off the roof, Vincent?

37:35.421 --> 37:37.188
I saw dudes throwing things.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.657
I thought
it would be funny, too.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.058
If you had hit someone,

37:40.158 --> 37:43.395
there's a good chance
you would've killed them.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.763
Would that be funny?

37:44.863 --> 37:47.098
No, ma'am.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.439
Is there anything
you want to say to me, Vincent?

37:54.806 --> 37:56.675
I'm sorry.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.009
I imagine you are.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.011
You're sorry,
and you're scared,

38:00.111 --> 38:02.414
but I need you to remember
what it feels like

38:02.514 --> 38:05.651
to be sorry and scared.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.252
You remember what it felt like

38:07.353 --> 38:09.921
when you threw that concrete
off the roof?
Yes.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.924
Was there a split second
when you wished you hadn't?

38:13.024 --> 38:16.027
When you knew
you had done something wrong,

38:16.127 --> 38:19.297
and you wished
you had that split second back?

38:27.105 --> 38:30.308
I'm going to give it
back to you, Vincent.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.958
♪ Yesterday I had nothing ♪

38:47.058 --> 38:49.728
♪ Didn't know whether

38:55.300 --> 38:56.635
You're welcome.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.738

39:03.341 --> 39:05.911
Turns out this guy
had no relatives.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.680
His sister in Shreveport
died four years ago.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.982
Sad.
What's sad?

39:11.082 --> 39:12.551
That he died, and there
was no one to notify.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.653
Well, maybe I should give you
a list of my relatives

39:14.753 --> 39:16.988
so you can notify them.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.990
I don't think
you want it to be me.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.827

♪ That was yesterday ♪

39:25.797 --> 39:28.400

So we're here to honor

39:32.738 --> 39:34.406
Mr. Junior Hunter

39:34.506 --> 39:36.174
whom we all will miss.

39:36.274 --> 39:39.310
And when the police
get through with it,

39:39.411 --> 39:41.847
I will lay claim
to his special chair,

39:41.947 --> 39:44.349
and I will sit on it,

39:44.450 --> 39:45.917
and I will remember him.

39:47.986 --> 39:48.987
I also would like to thank

39:49.087 --> 39:50.388
Police Inspector Haywood

39:50.489 --> 39:53.825
for providing
the food and drink

39:53.925 --> 39:56.127
you're enjoying here tonight.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.362
And I also would like

39:57.463 --> 40:01.332
to thank her for
getting my grandson

40:01.433 --> 40:03.268

He may not have
had any family,

40:13.344 --> 40:15.246
but he sure had
a lot of friends.

40:15.346 --> 40:17.516
What you... you trying
to make me feel better?

40:17.616 --> 40:20.986
Why would I even try
to do that, Sandeford?

40:21.086 --> 40:24.590
So I'm sure you know who
the anonymous donor is, right?

40:24.690 --> 40:25.924
Why would you think that?

40:26.024 --> 40:28.093
An instinctive grasp
of the obvious.

40:28.193 --> 40:29.695
When it comes
to Raymond O. Sharpe,

40:29.795 --> 40:32.798
one wants to maintain a certain
level of credible deniability.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.500
So, better if I don't know.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.503
He's got his own agenda, Regina.
Which is what?

40:37.603 --> 40:40.071
From what I'm hearing,
he might make a run at mayor.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.174
What does that mean for you?

40:43.274 --> 40:46.612
What it means for both of us is
that he's got a long memory.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.079
And that's gonna
determine whether

40:48.179 --> 40:49.981
he's gonna be a supporter
for all of these things

40:50.081 --> 40:52.283
that you're trying to do,
or an impediment.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.052
You've known me
a long time, Chief.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.287
You really think I want
to get involved in politics?

40:56.387 --> 40:58.824
I have known you a long time,

40:58.924 --> 41:00.892
which is why it's hard
for me to imagine

41:00.992 --> 41:04.930
that you don't think
you already are.

41:05.030 --> 41:08.667
Good night.
