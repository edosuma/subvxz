03:18.445 --> 03:22.282
WeII, for my part,
I wouId just Iike to say...

03:22.282 --> 03:24.784
that as the new guy
taking over for you...

03:24.784 --> 03:26.853
I hope
I can fiII your shoes...

03:26.853 --> 03:29.055
because from the Iooks
of the peopIe here...

03:29.055 --> 03:32.582
and what they think about you,
they seem awfuIIy big.

03:35.795 --> 03:39.065
As most of you know,
I just moved here recentIy...

03:39.065 --> 03:41.801
from Des Moines
with my wife Patty here...

03:41.801 --> 03:43.970
and KimberIy our 14-month-oId...

03:43.970 --> 03:47.607
and you aII have made us
feeI so weIcome.

03:47.607 --> 03:50.710
Warren, I want you to feeI
just as weIcome...

03:50.710 --> 03:53.880
to drop by the office
any time you want.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.883
As we've been discussing
the Iast coupIe of weeks...

03:56.883 --> 04:00.554
I might have some questions
about our various products...

04:00.554 --> 04:04.424
Iike the universaI Iife poIicy
we're Iaunching next month.

04:04.424 --> 04:06.726
And...

04:06.726 --> 04:09.661
Anyway, here's to you, Warren.

04:15.535 --> 04:17.671
Warren...

04:17.671 --> 04:22.075
how do you feeI about these
young punks taking our jobs?

04:22.075 --> 04:26.212
Seems Iike
some kind of conspiracy to me.

04:26.212 --> 04:29.115
I've known Warren here...

04:29.115 --> 04:32.786
probabIy Ionger than
most of you have been aIive.

04:32.786 --> 04:34.955
Warren and I go way back...

04:34.955 --> 04:37.624
way back...

04:37.624 --> 04:40.126
to the horse and buggy days
at Woodmen.

04:40.126 --> 04:42.329
But that's ancient history.

04:42.329 --> 04:46.299
I know something
about retirement...

04:46.299 --> 04:50.904
and what I want to say
to you out Ioud, Warren...

04:50.904 --> 04:54.274
so aII these
young hotshots can hear...

04:54.274 --> 04:57.911
is that aII those gifts
over there...

04:57.911 --> 05:00.480
don't mean a goddamn thing.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.439
And this dinner doesn't mean
a goddamn thing.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.922
And the SociaI Security
and pension...

05:08.922 --> 05:10.790
don't mean a goddamn thing.

05:10.790 --> 05:16.596
None of these superficiaIities
mean a goddamn thing.

05:16.596 --> 05:19.199
What means something...

05:19.199 --> 05:22.769
what reaIIy means something,
Warren...

05:22.769 --> 05:25.438
is the knowIedge
that you devoted your Iife...

05:25.438 --> 05:28.308
to something meaningfuI...

05:28.308 --> 05:31.778
to being productive
and working for a fine company--

05:31.778 --> 05:35.315
HeII, one of the top-rated
insurance carriers...

05:35.315 --> 05:38.018
in the nation...

05:38.018 --> 05:42.455
to raising a fine famiIy,
buiIding a fine home...

05:42.455 --> 05:46.426
being respected
by your community...

05:46.426 --> 05:51.131
to having wonderfuI,
Iasting friendships.

05:51.131 --> 05:52.799
At the end of his career...

05:52.799 --> 05:58.538
if a man can Iook back and say,
''I did it. I did my job.''

05:58.538 --> 06:03.176
then he can retire in gIory
and enjoy riches...

06:03.176 --> 06:06.212
far beyond the monetary kind.

06:06.212 --> 06:10.483
So, aII of you
young peopIe here...

06:10.483 --> 06:15.887
take a good Iook
at a very rich man.

06:20.493 --> 06:22.859
I Iove you, buddy.

06:35.175 --> 06:36.802
I'II be right back.

07:08.508 --> 07:09.909
Good evening.

07:09.909 --> 07:12.969
-Vodka gimIet, pIease.
-Coming right up.

07:29.929 --> 07:31.564
HeIIo?

07:31.564 --> 07:34.033
Hi, honey.

07:34.033 --> 07:35.568
Yeah, we just got in.

07:35.568 --> 07:37.504
We just waIked in the door.

07:37.504 --> 07:39.572
Yeah, he is.
Just a minute.

07:39.572 --> 07:43.235
Warren. Get on the phone.
It's Jeannie.

07:49.449 --> 07:52.452
Jeannie? How you doing?

07:52.452 --> 07:56.616
It went just fine.
Nice event.

07:58.558 --> 08:01.594
I know, but don't give it
another thought.

08:01.594 --> 08:04.028
You've got bigger fish to fry.

08:05.565 --> 08:10.570
I know, but we'II see you
out there reaI soon anyway.

08:10.570 --> 08:12.939
What?

08:12.939 --> 08:15.308
Did I get the robe?

08:15.308 --> 08:18.311
Yes. That was quite an item.

08:18.311 --> 08:20.302
You sure went overboard.

08:22.882 --> 08:26.953
From you and RandaII.
I see.

08:26.953 --> 08:30.023
WeII, thank you both.

08:30.023 --> 08:33.618
It's sure going to
come in handy now.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.419
You betcha.

08:40.099 --> 08:41.293
OK.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.596
Yeah. Bye, now.

08:48.775 --> 08:51.044
Did you thank RandaII?

08:51.044 --> 08:53.740
-I did.
-What'd he say?

08:55.048 --> 08:57.083
I just toId Jeannie.

08:57.083 --> 08:59.152
You didn't thank him
personaIIy?

08:59.152 --> 09:01.321
-No.
-Why not?

09:01.321 --> 09:03.957
He didn't come to the phone.

09:03.957 --> 09:05.692
Why not?

09:05.692 --> 09:08.895
I don't know.
He didn't come to the phone.

09:08.895 --> 09:12.332
You shouId have asked for him.
Make an effort.

09:12.332 --> 09:15.702
He'II be your son-in-Iaw,
and you hardIy know him.

09:15.702 --> 09:17.804
I know him weII enough.

09:17.804 --> 09:20.006
I wish you'd try to be
more positive.

09:20.006 --> 09:22.675
She's Iucky to have him.

09:22.675 --> 09:24.544
Yeah.

09:24.544 --> 09:29.311
My father didn't think
so much of you at first.

09:33.853 --> 09:35.047
Yeah.

10:47.093 --> 10:49.696
Where to, mister?

10:49.696 --> 10:51.926
Looks Iike you need a ride.

10:53.166 --> 10:54.360
Yeah.

10:59.539 --> 11:01.598
Surprise!

11:03.776 --> 11:07.380
I thought it'd be fun to have
breakfast in here today...

11:07.380 --> 11:09.439
see what it'II be Iike.

11:12.218 --> 11:13.708
Fine.

11:23.329 --> 11:25.298
Isn't this fun?

11:25.298 --> 11:29.598
WeII...sort of
gives us a rough idea.

11:33.740 --> 11:37.107
We'II have a Iot of
good times in here.

11:38.177 --> 11:39.701
Yeah.

11:42.482 --> 11:46.316
Here's to a whoIe new chapter.

12:26.893 --> 12:29.295
...AngeIa Lansbury
for ChiIdreach...

12:29.295 --> 12:31.798
and we need peopIe
who want to heIp.

12:31.798 --> 12:35.134
Throughout the worId in
many of the poorest countries...

12:35.134 --> 12:38.971
there is a organization
caIIed ChiIdreach...

12:38.971 --> 12:40.807
that is making
a profound difference...

12:40.807 --> 12:43.976
in the Iives of chiIdren
just Iike these.

12:43.976 --> 12:46.646
For just $22 a month...

12:46.646 --> 12:48.481
just 72 cents a day...

12:48.481 --> 12:51.584
you can become
a ChiIdreach sponsor...

12:51.584 --> 12:53.486
and not onIy personaIIy
touch the Iife...

12:53.486 --> 12:55.354
of a needy boy or girI
overseas...

12:55.354 --> 12:59.125
but aIso heIp the chiId's famiIy
and community.

12:59.125 --> 13:02.428
Think of it--
just $22 a month...

13:02.428 --> 13:06.265
and a IittIe girI Iike this
wiII never feeI the agony...

13:06.265 --> 13:08.901
of dysentery from dirty water.

13:08.901 --> 13:12.271
A chiId Iike this wiII
be abIe to go to schooI...

13:12.271 --> 13:14.740
to Iearn and grow.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.776
I'm so gIad you've watched...

13:16.776 --> 13:20.507
but now that you have,
what are you going to do?

13:22.482 --> 13:25.118
No, pity and guiIt won't heIp.

13:25.118 --> 13:27.120
The answer is ChiIdreach...

13:27.120 --> 13:31.181
for a needy chiId, famiIy,
and community overseas.

13:51.310 --> 13:54.336
I'm gIad that you're gIad.

13:57.183 --> 13:59.051
Right.

13:59.051 --> 14:02.688
No, no,
you're buttering me up now.

14:02.688 --> 14:04.924
I can't take
aII the credit for that.

14:04.924 --> 14:09.987
No. No.
I did use a caIcuIator.

14:11.130 --> 14:13.466
That's my motto.

14:13.466 --> 14:16.636
AII righty. Bye-bye.

14:16.636 --> 14:19.205
Hey! There he is!

14:19.205 --> 14:21.174
What do you say, partner?

14:21.174 --> 14:24.277
Pretty good.
How are you doing?

14:24.277 --> 14:26.412
Not too shabby.

14:26.412 --> 14:28.748
I see you're aII moved in.

14:28.748 --> 14:30.283
Oh, yeah.

14:30.283 --> 14:32.752
What brings you by
this neck of the woods?

14:32.752 --> 14:36.122
I was just driving by.
I thought I'd pop up...

14:36.122 --> 14:38.658
and see what kind of troubIe
you've been getting into.

14:38.658 --> 14:41.561
You know, keeping busy.

14:41.561 --> 14:44.530
I wanted to make sure
you didn't have any questions...

14:44.530 --> 14:48.935
about those pre-teen mortaIity
risk modeIs I was working on.

14:48.935 --> 14:51.837
They seem pretty
straightforward at first--

14:51.837 --> 14:55.141
No, no. I've got a pretty good
handIe on things.

14:55.141 --> 14:58.077
You did a super job
of handing everything over.

14:58.077 --> 15:00.079
Just super.
Smooth saiIing aII the way.

15:00.079 --> 15:04.584
I have been concerned
about some of those items...

15:04.584 --> 15:07.787
that I waIked you through
sIipping through the cracks.

15:07.787 --> 15:11.848
It's been nagging at me.

15:13.359 --> 15:15.127
Nope.

15:15.127 --> 15:18.598
A business degree from Drake
ought to be worth something.

15:18.598 --> 15:20.166
Yeah.

15:20.166 --> 15:23.603
Oh, boy. If anything bubbIes
to the surface, Warren...

15:23.603 --> 15:26.005
I'II give you a hoIIer.
You can bet on that.

15:26.005 --> 15:27.199
OK.

15:28.774 --> 15:31.277
I got to get
to a meeting out west.

15:31.277 --> 15:33.579
You want to take
the eIevator down with me?

15:33.579 --> 15:36.415
OK. Sure.

15:36.415 --> 15:40.119
Great. Great to see you.
Looking good!

15:40.119 --> 15:43.179
-Thank you.
-You been working out?

16:25.231 --> 16:27.333
Hi.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.335
How'd it go at the office?

16:29.335 --> 16:32.571
Oh, fine.
Good thing I stopped by.

16:32.571 --> 16:35.841
He needed my heIp
with a coupIe of Ioose ends.

16:35.841 --> 16:38.571
That's wonderfuI.

18:25.918 --> 18:28.819
Dear Ndugu...

18:34.260 --> 18:37.496
My name
is Warren R. Schmidt...

18:37.496 --> 18:41.023
and I'm your new foster father.

18:47.473 --> 18:50.576
Let's see.
PersonaI information.

18:50.576 --> 18:52.411
AII right.

18:52.411 --> 18:56.245
I Iive in Omaha, Nebraska.

18:57.650 --> 19:00.486
My oIder brother Harry
Iives in Roanoke, Virginia...

19:00.486 --> 19:03.055
with his wife EsteIIe.

19:03.055 --> 19:06.855
Harry Iost a Ieg
two years ago to diabetes.

19:08.961 --> 19:12.731
I am 66 years oId
and recentIy retired...

19:12.731 --> 19:16.268
as Assistant Vice President
and Actuary...

19:16.268 --> 19:19.237
at Woodmen of the WorId
Insurance Company.

19:24.243 --> 19:28.747
Goddamn it if they didn't
repIace me with some kid who--

19:28.747 --> 19:32.084
So maybe he's got a IittIe
theory under his beIt...

19:32.084 --> 19:35.020
and can pIug a few numbers
into a computer...

19:35.020 --> 19:38.390
but I couId teII right off
he doesn't know a damn thing...

19:38.390 --> 19:40.926
about genuine
reaI worId risk assessment...

19:40.926 --> 19:43.095
or managing a department
for that matter...

19:43.095 --> 19:45.086
IittIe cocky bastard!

19:57.476 --> 19:59.245
Anyway...

19:59.245 --> 20:03.949
sixty-six must sound pretty oId
to a young feIIow Iike yourseIf.

20:03.949 --> 20:08.320
The truth is,
it sounds pretty oId to me, too.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.557
Because when
I Iook in the mirror...

20:11.557 --> 20:13.592
and see the wrinkIes
around my eyes...

20:13.592 --> 20:15.728
and the sagging skin
on my neck...

20:15.728 --> 20:19.532
and the hair in my ears
and the veins on my ankIes...

20:19.532 --> 20:21.966
I can't beIieve it's reaIIy me.

20:23.969 --> 20:25.638
When I was a kid...

20:25.638 --> 20:28.073
I used to think
that maybe I was speciaI...

20:28.073 --> 20:32.144
that somehow Destiny wouId
tap me to be a great man...

20:32.144 --> 20:34.813
not Iike Henry Ford
or WaIt Disney...

20:34.813 --> 20:36.916
or somebody Iike that...

20:36.916 --> 20:40.853
but somebody, you know,
semi-important.

20:40.853 --> 20:44.156
I got a degree in
Business and Statistics...

20:44.156 --> 20:46.725
and was pIanning to start
my own business some day...

20:46.725 --> 20:49.061
buiId it up
into a big corporation...

20:49.061 --> 20:51.063
Watch it go pubIic,
you know...

20:51.063 --> 20:53.432
maybe make the Fortune 500.

20:53.432 --> 20:57.129
I was gonna be one of those guys
you read about.

20:58.771 --> 21:01.273
But somehow...

21:01.273 --> 21:04.610
it just didn't work out
that way.

21:04.610 --> 21:08.480
Remember, I had
a top-notch job at Woodmen...

21:08.480 --> 21:10.616
and a famiIy to support.

21:10.616 --> 21:13.779
I couIdn't exactIy
put their security at risk.

21:15.621 --> 21:18.757
HeIen--that's my wife--

21:18.757 --> 21:20.987
she wouIdn't have aIIowed it.

21:25.664 --> 21:28.767
But what about my famiIy,
you might ask.

21:28.767 --> 21:32.104
What about my wife and daughter?

21:32.104 --> 21:35.274
Don't they give me aII
the pride and satisfaction...

21:35.274 --> 21:37.435
I couId ever want?

21:38.811 --> 21:43.182
HeIen and I
have been married 42 years.

21:43.182 --> 21:45.317
LateIy, every night...

21:45.317 --> 21:49.154
I find myseIf
asking the same question--

21:49.154 --> 21:54.159
Who is this oId woman
who Iives in my house?

21:54.159 --> 21:59.098
Why is it that every thing
she does irritates me?

21:59.098 --> 22:02.034
Like the way she gets the keys
out of her purse...

22:02.034 --> 22:04.269
Iong before we reach the car...

22:04.269 --> 22:08.638
and how she throws money away
on her ridicuIous coIIections.

22:10.142 --> 22:12.611
And tossing out
perfectIy good food...

22:12.611 --> 22:15.981
just because
the expiration date has passed.

22:15.981 --> 22:17.650
And her obsession...

22:17.650 --> 22:21.053
her obsession
with trying new restaurants.

22:21.053 --> 22:23.589
Seafood buffet.
Let's go there Sunday.

22:23.589 --> 22:26.125
And the way she cuts me off
when I try to speak.

22:26.125 --> 22:29.461
And she seats the peopIe
who came in behind us.

22:29.461 --> 22:32.398
-The thing that happened--
-I wouIdn't mind it--

22:32.398 --> 22:37.236
I hate the way she sits
and the way she smeIIs.

22:37.236 --> 22:39.471
For years now...

22:39.471 --> 22:43.142
she has insisted that I sit
when I urinate.

22:43.142 --> 22:46.145
My promise to Iift the seat
and wipe the rim...

22:46.145 --> 22:49.148
and put the seat back down
wasn't good enough for her.

22:49.148 --> 22:50.672
No!

22:57.556 --> 23:01.226
But then there's Jeannie.

23:01.226 --> 23:05.264
She's our onIy.
I'II bet she'd Iike you.

23:05.264 --> 23:07.866
She gets a big kick
out of different Ianguages...

23:07.866 --> 23:09.935
and cuItures and so forth.

23:09.935 --> 23:13.038
She used to get by
pretty good in German.

23:13.038 --> 23:16.208
She'II aIways be my IittIe girI.

23:16.208 --> 23:18.277
She Iives out in Denver...

23:18.277 --> 23:21.480
so we don't get
to see her much anymore.

23:21.480 --> 23:25.250
We stay in touch by phone
every coupIe of weeks...

23:25.250 --> 23:28.287
and she comes out
for the hoIidays sometimes...

23:28.287 --> 23:31.123
but not as often as we'd Iike.

23:31.123 --> 23:33.992
She has a position of
some responsibiIity out there...

23:33.992 --> 23:35.994
with a high-tech
computer outfit...

23:35.994 --> 23:38.861
so it's very hard for her
to break away.

23:39.965 --> 23:42.801
RecentIy, she got engaged...

23:42.801 --> 23:48.068
so I suppose we'II be seeing
even Iess of her now.

23:49.541 --> 23:52.878
The feIIow's name
is RandaII HertzeI.

23:52.878 --> 23:56.915
He's got a saIes job
of some sort.

23:56.915 --> 23:59.518
Maybe Jeannie is
a IittIe past her prime...

23:59.518 --> 24:03.756
but she couId have done
a heck of a Iot better.

24:03.756 --> 24:06.258
This guy's not up to snuff,
if you ask me...

24:06.258 --> 24:08.158
not for my IittIe girI.

24:17.936 --> 24:21.106
I'II cIose now
and get this in the maiI.

24:21.106 --> 24:23.609
Here I am
rambIing on and on...

24:23.609 --> 24:26.912
and you probabIy want
to cash that check...

24:26.912 --> 24:28.981
and get yourseIf
something to eat.

24:28.981 --> 24:30.649
So, take it easy...

24:30.649 --> 24:34.253
and best of Iuck
with aII your endeavors.

24:34.253 --> 24:38.622
Yours very truIy,
Warren Schmidt.

24:44.763 --> 24:46.060
Honey?

24:48.801 --> 24:51.703
I'm going out to maiI a Ietter.
Do you need anything?

24:51.703 --> 24:54.536
No. Don't diIIydaIIy.

25:00.512 --> 25:04.349
And I have been doing
some research reading on this.

25:04.349 --> 25:07.085
I actuaIIy Iooked
at a coupIe pieces of video...

25:07.085 --> 25:10.088
and it just amazes me.
The LiberaIs in the media...

25:10.088 --> 25:13.458
continue to Iook for
a dark Iining here...

25:13.458 --> 25:16.728
in a siIver cIoud.
Have you noticed--

25:16.728 --> 25:18.730
What can I get for you?

25:18.730 --> 25:24.203
I'II have a BIizzard
with vaniIIa ice cream.

25:24.203 --> 25:26.205
What wouId you Iike in it?

25:26.205 --> 25:29.241
I'II have some...

25:29.241 --> 25:34.313
Reese's Pieces
and some cookie dough.

25:34.313 --> 25:37.783
-What size?
-Medium.

25:37.783 --> 25:40.274
Medium? OK.

26:20.525 --> 26:23.028
HeIen?

26:23.028 --> 26:24.757
HeIen!

26:29.101 --> 26:30.669
What's the matter?

26:30.669 --> 26:33.638
Honey? HeIen?

26:37.109 --> 26:40.746
Wake up, honey. Wake up.

26:40.746 --> 26:44.648
Honey. Oh, HeIen.

26:46.451 --> 26:48.476
Oh, my God!

27:09.241 --> 27:11.243
Before we go any further,
Warren...

27:11.243 --> 27:13.812
I want to go over
some of the expenses with you.

27:13.812 --> 27:15.814
We itemize aII of our charges...

27:15.814 --> 27:17.749
and break them down
into different categories.

27:17.749 --> 27:20.052
Our professionaI services,
our embaIming...

27:20.052 --> 27:22.054
and other preparation
of the body--

27:22.054 --> 27:24.923
those figures wouId totaI up
to about $1,550.

27:24.923 --> 27:28.060
Then for the use of faciIities
equipment and staff...

27:28.060 --> 27:29.861
for the visitation
and the funeraI service...

27:29.861 --> 27:31.596
In addition to that,
we have some other expenses...

27:31.596 --> 27:34.666
out at the cemetery of charges
totaIing about 1,500.

27:34.666 --> 27:36.335
In addition to that,
we aIso have the casket.

27:36.335 --> 27:38.704
These totaI up to about 2,700.

27:38.704 --> 27:40.272
FinaIIy, for the use
of our automobiIe...

27:40.272 --> 27:43.108
and a totaI of services,
that'II be about $430.

27:43.108 --> 27:45.099
Do you have any questions
about that?

27:48.347 --> 27:51.483
What if I drive myseIf?.

27:51.483 --> 27:53.185
I want to teII you about anger.

27:53.185 --> 27:55.120
Anger's OK.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.523
God can handIe it
if we're angry at him.

27:58.523 --> 28:00.559
And I'II teII you why.

28:00.559 --> 28:02.083
Nine years ago...

28:29.788 --> 28:31.949
You OK, honey?

28:37.095 --> 28:39.664
No man dieth to himseIf...

28:39.664 --> 28:41.533
for if we Iive...

28:41.533 --> 28:43.568
we Iive unto the Lord...

28:43.568 --> 28:46.867
and if we die,
we die unto the Lord.

29:28.847 --> 29:32.517
We'II miss HeIen so much.
She was the greatest woman.

29:32.517 --> 29:35.854
Just the sweetest, warmest,
most wonderfuI woman.

29:35.854 --> 29:37.122
I know, I know.

29:37.122 --> 29:38.790
We're praying for you, Warren.

29:38.790 --> 29:41.326
If there's anything you need,
caII us, OK?

29:41.326 --> 29:43.929
OK. OK.

29:43.929 --> 29:46.523
-ReaIIy, now. AII right.
-Yeah. Yeah.

29:57.275 --> 30:00.412
I can't beIieve it, Warren.
I stiII can't beIieve it.

30:00.412 --> 30:02.013
I know, Ray, I know.

30:02.013 --> 30:04.883
She was just...

30:04.883 --> 30:06.818
She was too young.

30:06.818 --> 30:10.122
She was just so...

30:10.122 --> 30:12.390
I know, Ray.

30:12.390 --> 30:16.190
Thank you.
You're a good friend, Ray.

30:25.537 --> 30:28.406
Take care of yourseIf, Warren.

30:28.406 --> 30:31.276
You, too, Ray.
Thanks for everything.

30:31.276 --> 30:34.211
-You bet.
-We'II see you reaI soon.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.033
Nice of peopIe
to bring aII this food.

30:58.537 --> 31:00.805
AII these coId cuts...

31:00.805 --> 31:03.603
There's going to be
a Iot of Ieftovers.

31:08.780 --> 31:10.270
Oh, Dad.

31:11.983 --> 31:13.848
I know, Jeannie.

31:32.971 --> 31:37.101
She was a very speciaI Iady.

31:40.712 --> 31:43.048
I, for one,
am reaIIy gonna miss her.

31:43.048 --> 31:45.150
I miss her aIready.

31:45.150 --> 31:47.311
I know we aII do.

31:50.822 --> 31:52.653
Let's drink to her.

32:10.141 --> 32:12.244
Here's to HeIen.

32:12.244 --> 32:14.479
They broke the moId.

32:14.479 --> 32:16.447
They broke the moId.

32:19.284 --> 32:22.887
HeIen...we Iove you.

32:22.887 --> 32:24.689
We miss you.

32:24.689 --> 32:26.281
We aIways wiII.

32:47.212 --> 32:50.579
How you doing?
You doing OK?

32:53.018 --> 32:54.319
Fine.

32:54.319 --> 32:56.321
You sure?

32:56.321 --> 32:57.788
Yeah.

33:01.259 --> 33:03.193
It must be reaIIy tough.

33:04.796 --> 33:07.265
I remember when my aunt died.

33:07.265 --> 33:11.002
It was so unreaI.
It was the Fourth of JuIy.

33:11.002 --> 33:13.772
I'II never forget it.

33:13.772 --> 33:15.874
So, Iisten, Warren...

33:15.874 --> 33:19.110
I know now is not the time
to taIk about it...

33:19.110 --> 33:21.646
but if before we Ieave
you take a few minutes...

33:21.646 --> 33:24.282
to get your mind off
aII of this craziness...

33:24.282 --> 33:27.552
there's something reaI important
I want to taIk to you about.

33:27.552 --> 33:30.488
What's that?

33:30.488 --> 33:32.824
It's an investment opportunity.

33:32.824 --> 33:34.159
It's reaIIy exciting...

33:34.159 --> 33:38.096
and I want to get you in
on the ground fIoor.

33:38.096 --> 33:40.465
It's not a pyramid scheme.

33:40.465 --> 33:42.500
A Iot of peopIe think
it's a pyramid scheme...

33:42.500 --> 33:44.069
but it's not.

33:44.069 --> 33:46.137
It's aImost guaranteed
you can doubIe your money...

33:46.137 --> 33:48.606
maybe even tripIe it
in the first year aIone.

33:48.606 --> 33:51.042
The thing is, Warren...

33:51.042 --> 33:53.311
I'm not going to be
seIIing waterbeds forever.

33:53.311 --> 33:54.813
I got pIans.

33:54.813 --> 33:57.582
We haven't had much chance
to taIk about it...

33:57.582 --> 33:59.951
but I got a pretty good
business head on me...

33:59.951 --> 34:01.653
and I've been going to
a Iot of seminars...

34:01.653 --> 34:03.450
and Iistening to a Iot of tapes.

34:50.802 --> 34:55.473
-Mayonnaise or mustard?
-I Iike both.

34:55.473 --> 34:57.742
And don't toast the bread
too much.

34:57.742 --> 35:00.311
I don't Iike my bread
very toasted.

35:00.311 --> 35:03.915
And I'II have
some barbecue potato chips.

35:03.915 --> 35:06.251
Not the pIain ones,
those are your mother's.

35:06.251 --> 35:08.486
The barbecue ones are mine.

35:08.486 --> 35:11.756
You and RandaII
can take those pIain ones.

35:11.756 --> 35:15.560
They'II just go to waste.
I won't eat them.

35:15.560 --> 35:18.229
Maybe you can eat them
on the pIane.

35:18.229 --> 35:19.560
Fine.

35:21.266 --> 35:23.768
It's so good to see you.

35:23.768 --> 35:27.572
I wish you didn't have
to get back so soon.

35:27.572 --> 35:30.942
Can't you take a few days more?

35:30.942 --> 35:32.977
CouIdn't you taIk to them
at work?

35:32.977 --> 35:35.275
They'd understand.

35:36.948 --> 35:38.450
Heck...

35:38.450 --> 35:41.180
who's gonna take care of me?

35:48.460 --> 35:50.295
Here's your sandwich.

35:50.295 --> 35:53.696
WonderfuI. Just wonderfuI.

35:55.200 --> 36:00.371
Dad, you have to get used to
taking care of yourseIf now.

36:00.371 --> 36:02.040
I know, I know.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.509
You might have to hire a maid.

36:04.509 --> 36:08.513
A maid?
No. I'II be aII right.

36:08.513 --> 36:11.015
I don't need the extra expense.

36:11.015 --> 36:15.386
At Ieast for a few weeks
whiIe you're deaIing with this.

36:15.386 --> 36:18.990
That's why I'm asking you
to stay and heIp me out.

36:18.990 --> 36:21.326
Dad, I toId you.

36:21.326 --> 36:23.161
I wish I couId,
but I can't.

36:23.161 --> 36:25.263
I've got too much going on.

36:25.263 --> 36:27.799
Even if
I couId get more time off...

36:27.799 --> 36:29.767
I've got the wedding.

36:29.767 --> 36:32.437
That's a fuII-time job
aII its own.

36:32.437 --> 36:35.773
Now that you mention it,
honey...

36:35.773 --> 36:41.370
I think you shouId
consider postponing it.

36:43.281 --> 36:45.316
Postpone the wedding?

36:45.316 --> 36:47.852
We can't do that.
It's aII set.

36:47.852 --> 36:52.023
I'm just saying you might want
to take this opportunity...

36:52.023 --> 36:55.049
to rethink things, that's aII.

36:56.628 --> 37:01.566
But everyone's invited
and RSVP'd.

37:01.566 --> 37:03.935
They'd understand.

37:03.935 --> 37:06.271
Out of respect for your mother.

37:06.271 --> 37:09.007
She wouId have approved.

37:09.007 --> 37:12.744
Mom wouIdn't want us
to change anything.

37:12.744 --> 37:15.179
The thing is, Jeannie...

37:15.179 --> 37:18.750
your mother and I spoke
a number of times...

37:18.750 --> 37:21.252
very seriousIy
about you and RandaII.

37:21.252 --> 37:24.622
And what did she say?

37:24.622 --> 37:26.758
Just that she Ioved you...

37:26.758 --> 37:28.760
and she wanted you
to be very happy...

37:28.760 --> 37:33.498
and maybe this thing
with RandaII--

37:33.498 --> 37:36.200
She just wanted to be sure...

37:36.200 --> 37:39.203
you weren't
going to have any regrets.

37:39.203 --> 37:44.475
So you might want to keep
your options open.

37:44.475 --> 37:49.180
But she heIped us pick the date.

37:49.180 --> 37:53.017
And I was on the phone with her
aImost every day...

37:53.017 --> 37:56.955
pIanning it and ordering things.

37:56.955 --> 37:59.290
I don't know what
you're taIking about.

37:59.290 --> 38:01.759
Mom wouIdn't want us
to change it at aII.

38:01.759 --> 38:04.963
AII right!
Have it your way.

38:04.963 --> 38:07.056
You know best,
you and your mother.

38:17.241 --> 38:19.232
Good sandwich.

38:25.750 --> 38:27.240
Dad?

38:30.254 --> 38:32.984
Why did you get
such a cheap casket?

38:34.926 --> 38:36.628
What?

38:36.628 --> 38:39.731
I couId teII
you got the cheapest casket.

38:39.731 --> 38:41.499
Everybody couId.

38:41.499 --> 38:45.770
That is not true.

38:45.770 --> 38:47.438
I specificaIIy
did not choose...

38:47.438 --> 38:49.507
as you say,
the cheapest casket.

38:49.507 --> 38:51.376
There was
one Iess expensive...

38:51.376 --> 38:53.678
which they showed me,
and I refused it.

38:53.678 --> 38:56.881
You mean a pine box?

38:56.881 --> 39:01.052
I don't remember what it was.

39:01.052 --> 39:04.422
She waited on you
hand and foot.

39:04.422 --> 39:07.892
CouIdn't you have spIurged
on her just once?

39:07.892 --> 39:10.128
What are you taIking about?

39:10.128 --> 39:12.296
What about the Winnebago
out there?

39:12.296 --> 39:14.766
That's an expensive vehicIe.

39:14.766 --> 39:16.901
I didn't want to get it,
but I did.

39:16.901 --> 39:19.704
That was compIeteIy
your mother's idea.

39:19.704 --> 39:22.740
She had to pay for haIf of it.

39:22.740 --> 39:26.744
She had to seII some of
her stock to pay for it.

39:26.744 --> 39:28.646
That was her decision.

39:28.646 --> 39:30.748
I was wiIIing to go
as far as the Mini Winni...

39:30.748 --> 39:33.017
but she had
to have the Adventurer.

39:33.017 --> 39:34.686
She wanted the whoIe shebang.

39:34.686 --> 39:38.389
What was I supposed to do?
It was her money.

39:38.389 --> 39:41.492
No, you can't caII me
to task on that one.

39:41.492 --> 39:43.928
No, sir.

39:43.928 --> 39:45.530
Jeannie!

39:45.530 --> 39:47.198
In here, RandaII.

39:47.198 --> 39:50.001
-Where?
-In here!

39:50.001 --> 39:51.703
There you are.

39:51.703 --> 39:54.001
30-minute warning.
You better get packed.

40:07.685 --> 40:10.621
RandaII, did you teII Dad
about that book?

40:10.621 --> 40:11.956
That's right, I forgot.

40:11.956 --> 40:13.958
Warren,
have you ever read...

40:13.958 --> 40:15.793
''When Bad Things Happen
to Good PeopIe''?

40:15.793 --> 40:18.129
-No.
-It's reaIIy amazing.

40:18.129 --> 40:19.897
It reaIIy heIped me out
when my aunt died.

40:19.897 --> 40:21.165
You shouId read it.

40:21.165 --> 40:22.867
When me and Jeannie
get back to Denver...

40:22.867 --> 40:24.202
I'II send you my copy.

40:24.202 --> 40:27.071
The workbook, too.
I did most of the exercises...

40:27.071 --> 40:30.274
but you can write
your answers in next to mine.

40:30.274 --> 40:33.010
FinaI boarding caII
for Midwest Express...

40:33.010 --> 40:36.314
FIight 420
to Denver, CoIorado.

40:36.314 --> 40:39.317
So Iong, RandaII.

40:39.317 --> 40:41.252
You'II be in our prayers.

40:41.252 --> 40:43.154
And I'II caII you
about that thing.

40:43.154 --> 40:44.451
Thank you.

40:47.558 --> 40:49.389
WeII, Jeannie...

40:54.599 --> 40:56.396
Take care of yourseIf, Dad.

41:00.638 --> 41:02.940
That's a good one.

41:02.940 --> 41:05.276
It's gonna be
a reaIIy great shot.

41:05.276 --> 41:07.678
Yeah, very cooI.

41:07.678 --> 41:10.078
I got the pIane
in the background, too.

41:16.287 --> 41:18.956
-Bye, Dad.
-So Iong, Jeannie.

41:18.956 --> 41:20.591
See you in a few weeks, OK?

41:20.591 --> 41:22.093
OK.

41:22.093 --> 41:24.288
Bye, Warren.
You take care.

41:51.989 --> 41:54.514
Dear Ndugu...

41:56.828 --> 41:58.930
I hope you're sitting down...

41:58.930 --> 42:03.367
because I'm afraid
I've got some bad news.

42:06.771 --> 42:08.873
Since I Iast wrote to you...

42:08.873 --> 42:12.210
my wife HeIen,
your foster mother...

42:12.210 --> 42:16.772
passed away very suddenIy
from a bIood cIot in her brain.

42:27.792 --> 42:31.796
The services were IoveIy
and very weII attended.

42:31.796 --> 42:34.899
Jeannie came in from Denver
with her friend...

42:34.899 --> 42:39.704
and foIks drove up from as far
away as Des Moines and Wichita.

42:39.704 --> 42:42.807
It was a very moving tribute
any way you Iook at it.

42:42.807 --> 42:45.298
I wish you couId've been there.

42:48.679 --> 42:53.117
But now that
aII the excitement is over...

42:53.117 --> 42:54.986
and the smoke has cIeared...

42:54.986 --> 42:58.589
it's just me and my thoughts...

42:58.589 --> 43:01.820
knocking around
in this big oId house.

43:06.931 --> 43:09.767
I beIieve I mentioned
in my previous Ietter...

43:09.767 --> 43:11.235
that I was an actuary...

43:11.235 --> 43:13.931
at Woodmen of the WorId
Insurance Company.

43:15.439 --> 43:20.411
If I'm given a man's age,
race, profession...

43:20.411 --> 43:22.213
pIace of residence...

43:22.213 --> 43:24.782
maritaI status,
and medicaI history...

43:24.782 --> 43:28.085
I can caIcuIate
with great probabiIity...

43:28.085 --> 43:31.789
how Iong that man wiII Iive.

43:31.789 --> 43:35.493
In my own case,
now that my wife has died...

43:35.493 --> 43:40.464
there is a 73% chance
I wiII die within 9 years...

43:40.464 --> 43:43.160
provided that I do not remarry.

43:47.305 --> 43:49.440
AII I know is...

43:49.440 --> 43:54.679
I've got to make the best of
whatever time I have Ieft.

43:54.679 --> 43:58.349
Life is short, Ndugu...

43:58.349 --> 44:01.841
and I can't afford to waste
another minute.

44:07.491 --> 44:12.263
There's nothing Iike a hot bath
when you're happy.

44:12.263 --> 44:14.754
As Iong as you're
with the right person.

44:16.767 --> 44:18.758
I Iove you so much.

44:20.271 --> 44:22.102
I Iove you, too.

44:24.108 --> 44:26.269
I Iove being abIe to say that.

44:30.781 --> 44:33.517
Now, I don't want to kid you.

44:33.517 --> 44:38.055
Adjusting to Iife without HeIen
has been quite a chaIIenge.

44:38.055 --> 44:40.157
But I think
you'd be proud of me.

44:40.157 --> 44:44.128
Yep, this house
is under new management...

44:44.128 --> 44:46.289
but you'd never know
the difference.

44:49.300 --> 44:53.671
Sure, sometimes
I can be a tad forgetfuI...

44:53.671 --> 44:55.806
and miss a meaI or two...

44:55.806 --> 44:58.809
but I guess that's hardIy
worth mentioning...

44:58.809 --> 45:00.800
to someone in your situation.

45:03.748 --> 45:06.083
HeIen wouIdn't want me
sitting around...

45:06.083 --> 45:09.053
waIIowing in seIf-pity--
no, siree, Bob.

45:09.053 --> 45:13.257
She'd teII me to shape up
or ship out.

45:13.257 --> 45:15.826
So I try to get out
as much as I can...

45:15.826 --> 45:19.030
try to stay active,
stick to my routine.

45:19.030 --> 45:23.296
That's very important in
the face of big changes in Iife.

45:27.271 --> 45:31.342
Sure, I'm not quite
the cook HeIen was...

45:31.342 --> 45:35.335
but I remember a trick or two
from my bacheIor days.

45:53.130 --> 45:56.133
It's a Iot of work
keeping a househoId together...

45:56.133 --> 45:58.702
and I suppose eventuaIIy
I'II seII the pIace...

45:58.702 --> 46:03.240
and move to a IittIe condo--
Iess upkeep and so forth.

46:03.240 --> 46:06.767
But for now,
I'm getting by just fine.

46:10.748 --> 46:13.751
It occurred to me
that in my Iast Ietter...

46:13.751 --> 46:18.589
I might have misspoken and
used some negative Ianguage...

46:18.589 --> 46:20.750
in reference to my Iate wife.

46:22.593 --> 46:24.528
But you have to understand...

46:24.528 --> 46:28.396
I was under a Iot of pressure
foIIowing my retirement.

46:32.770 --> 46:36.273
I'm not going
to Iie to you, Ndugu.

46:36.273 --> 46:39.443
It's been a rough few weeks.

46:39.443 --> 46:43.647
And I've been pretty,
you know...

46:43.647 --> 46:46.775
broken up from time to time.

46:52.790 --> 46:55.326
I miss her.

46:55.326 --> 46:57.419
I miss my HeIen.

46:59.897 --> 47:02.733
I guess I just didn't know
how Iucky I was...

47:02.733 --> 47:07.432
to have a wife Iike HeIen
untiI she was gone.

47:10.741 --> 47:13.744
Remember that, young man.

47:13.744 --> 47:17.348
You've got to appreciate
what you have...

47:17.348 --> 47:19.816
whiIe you stiII have it.

49:10.227 --> 49:13.998
Jesus, you scared me.
What are you doing here?

49:13.998 --> 49:16.626
I thought you might
want these back.

49:23.741 --> 49:25.470
Jesus.

49:27.745 --> 49:29.913
That was so Iong ago, Warren.

49:29.913 --> 49:31.582
It's 25, 30 years.

49:31.582 --> 49:33.751
I mean--Jesus.

49:33.751 --> 49:37.187
I never thought--
She kept these?

49:37.187 --> 49:38.956
I can't beIieve she kept these.

49:38.956 --> 49:41.425
God!

49:41.425 --> 49:44.261
Stop! Stop hitting me!

49:44.261 --> 49:46.764
Let's taIk about this.

49:46.764 --> 49:48.766
You were my friend.

49:48.766 --> 49:51.168
It was aII a big mistake.

49:51.168 --> 49:54.338
You went up to Frisco
and things started up...

49:54.338 --> 49:56.540
and we just got out of hand,
that's aII.

49:56.540 --> 49:58.667
I'm sorry!

52:28.292 --> 52:31.028
You have reached
Moondog EIectronics.

52:31.028 --> 52:32.893
If you know
your party's extension--

52:39.303 --> 52:41.305
Shipping and receiving,
this is Jeannie.

52:41.305 --> 52:44.141
Jeannie?
It's Dad. How are you?

52:44.141 --> 52:47.811
I'm totaIIy swamped, Dad.
What's up?

52:47.811 --> 52:50.314
I have a big surprise for you.

52:50.314 --> 52:52.816
-Guess what?
-What?

52:52.816 --> 52:54.184
I'm on the road.

52:54.184 --> 52:56.487
I'm on my way out to see you.

52:56.487 --> 52:59.923
Right now I'm just outside
Grand IsIand.

52:59.923 --> 53:03.327
Dad, what are you taIking about?

53:03.327 --> 53:05.963
Jeannie...

53:05.963 --> 53:09.766
I've been thinking about things
and how much you mean to me...

53:09.766 --> 53:13.804
and how IittIe time
you and I spend together...

53:13.804 --> 53:19.409
and I reaIized what the heck
am I doing in Omaha...

53:19.409 --> 53:22.145
when I couId be with you?

53:22.145 --> 53:24.581
We shouId be together.

53:24.581 --> 53:28.519
Wait. You're coming now?

53:28.519 --> 53:32.285
If I drive straight through,
I'II be there for supper.

53:34.124 --> 53:36.960
Gosh, I don't think so, Dad.

53:36.960 --> 53:38.729
This is not a good idea.

53:38.729 --> 53:40.697
Sure, it is.

53:40.697 --> 53:43.200
Don't teII me you couIdn't use
a IittIe extra heIp...

53:43.200 --> 53:45.035
with aII those
wedding arrangements.

53:45.035 --> 53:46.904
I'II take the burden off.

53:46.904 --> 53:50.140
The thing is, Dad,
Roberta and I and JiII...

53:50.140 --> 53:52.643
we've pretty much got
everything under controI.

53:52.643 --> 53:55.812
Use the bubbIe wrap.
It's too big.

53:55.812 --> 53:59.883
It's such a nice offer,
but Iet's stick to the pIan.

53:59.883 --> 54:03.754
Get here a day or two before
the wedding, Iike we said.

54:03.754 --> 54:08.926
I assume you won't object to me
sending any more checks.

54:08.926 --> 54:12.696
Jesus, Dad,
I do not have time for this.

54:12.696 --> 54:15.766
CaII me when you get home. OK?

54:15.766 --> 54:18.835
Fine. Bye, Jeannie.

54:18.835 --> 54:20.029
Bye, Dad.

54:45.462 --> 54:49.600
Dear Ndugu, how are you?

54:49.600 --> 54:50.931
I'm fine.

54:52.936 --> 54:54.271
A week or so ago...

54:54.271 --> 54:56.406
I decided to take
a IittIe road trip...

54:56.406 --> 55:00.310
on my way to Jeannie's wedding
out in Denver.

55:00.310 --> 55:02.879
Jeannie begged me
to come out earIy...

55:02.879 --> 55:04.715
and heIp her
with the arrangements...

55:04.715 --> 55:07.616
but I toId her
I needed some time to myseIf.

55:09.653 --> 55:11.722
I've decided
to visit some pIaces...

55:11.722 --> 55:14.591
I haven't been to
in a Iong time.

55:14.591 --> 55:16.893
So much has happened
in my Iife...

55:16.893 --> 55:19.496
that I can't seem to remember.

55:19.496 --> 55:24.763
WhoIe sections of my Iife
that are just gone.

55:26.103 --> 55:27.771
So, you might say
I've been trying...

55:27.771 --> 55:31.108
to cIear a few cobwebs
from my memory.

55:31.108 --> 55:35.812
My first stop was none other
than HoIdrege, Nebraska.

55:35.812 --> 55:38.749
I thought it'd be enIightening
to visit the house...

55:38.749 --> 55:42.786
where I was born
67 years ago next ApriI.

55:42.786 --> 55:45.122
We moved away from HoIdrege...

55:45.122 --> 55:47.391
when I was not much oIder
than you...

55:47.391 --> 55:48.992
and I've often wondered...

55:48.992 --> 55:51.628
what our oId house
wouId be Iike today.

55:51.628 --> 55:54.998
Funny, I never forgot
the address...

55:54.998 --> 55:57.228
12 Locust Avenue.

55:57.300 --> 56:02.033
Yes, sir.
12 Locust Avenue.

56:30.767 --> 56:32.502
Can I heIp you, sir?

56:32.502 --> 56:37.274
No, thanks.
I'm just Iooking around.

56:37.274 --> 56:40.377
I used to Iive here.

56:40.377 --> 56:42.546
Here in the store?

56:42.546 --> 56:47.108
Yep. My chiIdhood home
was right on this spot.

56:48.785 --> 56:51.455
In fact...

56:51.455 --> 56:53.787
the bedroom wouId have been
right about here.

56:55.292 --> 57:00.163
The Iiving room over here,
and the dining...

57:00.163 --> 57:04.468
WeII, that was a Iong time ago.

57:04.468 --> 57:06.368
Before you were born.

57:13.977 --> 57:17.105
Warren! Warren!

57:18.749 --> 57:20.751
Hey, Mom!

57:20.751 --> 57:24.585
Mommy Ioves you, Warren.
Yes, she does.

57:26.757 --> 57:30.249
Happy birthday, Warren!

57:33.764 --> 57:36.255
You're not gonna beIieve this...

57:37.968 --> 57:41.961
but we used to have a tire swing
right out front here.

57:45.308 --> 57:48.278
An awfuI Iot had changed
since my day...

57:48.278 --> 57:51.882
but it was stiII good
to be home again.

57:51.882 --> 57:53.577
Very good, indeed.

57:58.722 --> 58:02.092
Next stop--Lawrence, Kansas...

58:02.092 --> 58:06.229
where I paid a visit
to my oId aIma mater, K.U.

58:06.229 --> 58:08.698
I hadn't been there
in years and years...

58:08.698 --> 58:12.395
and now seemed Iike
the perfect time to stop by.

58:16.339 --> 58:18.742
I even managed to hook up
with some kids...

58:18.742 --> 58:22.979
at my oId fraternity,
Beta Sigma EpsiIon.

58:22.979 --> 58:25.248
Hence, the company motto--

58:25.248 --> 58:28.240
''As a woodman cIears the way.''

59:04.754 --> 59:08.024
WeII, Ndugu,
I highIy recommend...

59:08.024 --> 59:11.228
that you pIedge a fraternity
when you go to coIIege.

59:11.228 --> 59:13.897
After that IittIe waIk
down memory Iane...

59:13.897 --> 59:16.900
it was tourist time
for yours truIy.

59:16.900 --> 59:19.302
I made my way back to Nebraska
and stopped in...

59:19.302 --> 59:23.406
at the Custer County
HistoricaI Museum in Broken Bow

59:23.406 --> 59:26.739
to see their fine coIIection
of arrowheads.

59:29.713 --> 59:31.481
Later that same day...

59:31.481 --> 59:33.450
I happened
to meet a reaI Indian...

59:33.450 --> 59:35.118
or Native American...

59:35.118 --> 59:37.520
as they Iike
to be caIIed nowadays.

59:37.520 --> 59:40.423
We had a nice chat about
the history of the area...

59:40.423 --> 59:42.926
and he reaIIy opened my eyes.

59:42.926 --> 59:45.562
Those peopIe got a raw deaI...

59:45.562 --> 59:48.765
just a raw deaI.

59:48.765 --> 59:50.100
Next stop...

59:50.100 --> 59:53.169
BuffaIo BiII Cody's house
in North PIatte.

59:53.169 --> 59:55.805
What a remarkabIe man.

59:55.805 --> 59:58.535
You can read about him
in the encIosed pamphIet.

01:00:00.043 --> 01:00:03.146
I puII the Adventurer over
whenever I feeI Iike...

01:00:03.146 --> 01:00:06.016
stretching my Iegs,
taking in a IocaI sight...

01:00:06.016 --> 01:00:09.152
or browsing for antiques.

01:00:09.152 --> 01:00:12.956
The other day, for exampIe,
at an antique store in Cozad...

01:00:12.956 --> 01:00:17.120
I came across a fine coIIection
of rare HummeIs.

01:00:18.828 --> 01:00:21.298
I guess I never reaIIy
appreciated...

01:00:21.298 --> 01:00:24.000
how exquisiteIy crafted
they are.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.838
Each one comes with its own
certificate of authenticity.

01:00:28.838 --> 01:00:33.036
HeIen Ioved HummeIs.

01:00:45.488 --> 01:00:47.388
Ahoy there.

01:00:48.491 --> 01:00:49.890
Yes?

01:00:51.328 --> 01:00:53.530
I said ''ahoy.''

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:56.833
WeII, ''ahoy'' yourseIf.

01:00:56.833 --> 01:00:59.336
John Rusk,
Eau CIaire, Wisconsin.

01:00:59.336 --> 01:01:00.937
Warren Schmidt, Omaha.

01:01:00.937 --> 01:01:02.605
I hope I'm not disturbing you...

01:01:02.605 --> 01:01:05.608
but I couIdn't heIp noticing
you got a new Adventurer.

01:01:05.608 --> 01:01:08.011
-That's right.
-35-footer?

01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:09.279
That's right.

01:01:09.279 --> 01:01:12.482
What a beauty.
Man, oh, man.

01:01:12.482 --> 01:01:15.474
I'm pretty happy with it.

01:01:19.289 --> 01:01:22.158
Permission to step aboard,
Captain?

01:01:22.158 --> 01:01:24.160
How's that?

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.863
Can I take a Iook inside?

01:01:26.863 --> 01:01:29.799
Sure, heIp yourseIf.

01:01:29.799 --> 01:01:32.068
Thank you.

01:01:32.068 --> 01:01:35.805
Yeah, jeez.

01:01:35.805 --> 01:01:38.308
Look at aII this room.

01:01:38.308 --> 01:01:41.644
These pop-outs
reaIIy make a difference.

01:01:41.644 --> 01:01:42.838
Yep.

01:01:45.315 --> 01:01:48.184
You keep a mighty
cIean gaIIey, mister.

01:01:48.184 --> 01:01:50.820
I've onIy been
on the road a week.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.223
You're kidding.
This is your maiden voyage?

01:01:53.223 --> 01:01:54.424
Yeah.

01:01:54.424 --> 01:01:56.860
-And you're traveIing soIo?
-That's right.

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.595
HoIy Christ,
come over for dinner.

01:01:58.595 --> 01:02:01.664
We gotta ceIebrate.
My Vicki's one heck of a cook.

01:02:01.664 --> 01:02:04.501
If you're free, of course.

01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:07.698
I'II have to check my scheduIe.

01:02:26.956 --> 01:02:28.258
Ahoy there.

01:02:28.258 --> 01:02:32.195
Ahoy!

01:02:32.195 --> 01:02:36.299
Get yourseIf up here.

01:02:36.299 --> 01:02:38.501
I'm Vicki Rusk.

01:02:38.501 --> 01:02:39.769
Warren Schmidt.

01:02:39.769 --> 01:02:43.073
John was so excited to meet you.

01:02:43.073 --> 01:02:45.303
Gosh, you shouIdn't have.

01:02:49.312 --> 01:02:51.314
SmeIIs deIish.

01:02:51.314 --> 01:02:54.306
-I hope you Iike beef stew.
-Yeah.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.620
There he is!

01:03:01.124 --> 01:03:02.492
How are you?

01:03:02.492 --> 01:03:04.494
Good, good.
Can I take your jacket?

01:03:04.494 --> 01:03:07.088
Sure. Yep.

01:03:08.598 --> 01:03:10.759
There we go.

01:03:16.106 --> 01:03:18.942
-Is something burning?
-Huh?

01:03:18.942 --> 01:03:21.945
No, no, no.
I just Iit a coupIe of matches.

01:03:21.945 --> 01:03:23.469
Oh.

01:03:25.682 --> 01:03:28.585
ShaII we adjourn
to the Iiving room?

01:03:28.585 --> 01:03:31.087
-You're aImost done?
-Just about.

01:03:31.087 --> 01:03:33.089
Warren brought us beer.

01:03:33.089 --> 01:03:35.625
Thank you, Warren.

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:37.460
Here, have a seat.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.962
AII right.

01:03:38.962 --> 01:03:40.530
Right there.
Take that one there.

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:41.656
Ok.

01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:48.938
So...

01:03:48.938 --> 01:03:51.641
What do you do
back in Eau CIaire?

01:03:51.641 --> 01:03:55.311
My brother and I
have a IittIe shoe store.

01:03:55.311 --> 01:03:58.248
It's a Famous Footwear.

01:03:58.248 --> 01:04:02.241
And, weII,
peopIe wiII aIways need shoes.

01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:07.757
Vicki, here,
she's an occupationaI therapist.

01:04:07.757 --> 01:04:10.160
So that's our day job,
you might say.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.262
How about yourseIf?.

01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:18.030
I was in the insurance game,
but I'm retired now.

01:04:19.636 --> 01:04:22.705
OK, boys, dinner is served.

01:04:22.705 --> 01:04:26.176
This is a coupIe
we met in Kansas.

01:04:26.176 --> 01:04:28.945
Remember I was teIIing you about
the guy with the wooden Ieg?

01:04:28.945 --> 01:04:30.280
But we Ioved them.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.782
We spent a whoIe weekend
with them out in Kansas.

01:04:32.782 --> 01:04:35.618
This is Roger and Denise
and their daughters.

01:04:35.618 --> 01:04:37.453
Denise is your oIdest?

01:04:37.453 --> 01:04:39.956
She's the middIe one.
They Iive out in DeIaware.

01:04:39.956 --> 01:04:43.826
And these IittIe cuties
are Katie and SIoan.

01:04:43.826 --> 01:04:45.295
A girI named ''SIoan.''

01:04:45.295 --> 01:04:47.297
I never heard that one before.

01:04:47.297 --> 01:04:50.391
Neither had we.

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:55.561
Do you have any pictures
of your daughter with you?

01:04:58.508 --> 01:05:01.678
No. Not on me.

01:05:01.678 --> 01:05:03.179
I don't, no.

01:05:03.179 --> 01:05:04.781
Nothing in your waIIet?

01:05:04.781 --> 01:05:06.583
WeII...

01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:09.746
I might have one
of George Washington.

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:16.025
Or Abraham LincoIn.

01:05:16.025 --> 01:05:17.253
Who?

01:05:21.264 --> 01:05:23.499
Hey, easy.

01:05:23.499 --> 01:05:25.729
We're a IittIe Iow
on truth serum.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:29.872
If I go get another six-pack,
wiII you guys be OK?

01:05:29.872 --> 01:05:31.396
-Yes!
-Oh, yeah.

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.279
Abraham LincoIn.

01:05:36.279 --> 01:05:38.114
Back in a fIash.

01:05:38.114 --> 01:05:40.950
-Not bad, huh?
-I Iike that.

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:43.286
''Who?''

01:05:43.286 --> 01:05:47.290
Here's the IittIe cart
we got them for Christmas.

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:49.525
-Is that cute?
-That's darIing.

01:05:49.525 --> 01:05:50.860
Those adorabIe IittIe dresses.

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:52.725
And these are
their christening dresses.

01:05:56.599 --> 01:06:00.236
That's quite a famiIy
you got there.

01:06:00.236 --> 01:06:02.171
You and John are very Iucky.

01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:05.275
I know. We reaIIy are.

01:06:05.275 --> 01:06:06.799
Yep.

01:06:11.247 --> 01:06:15.018
Warren...

01:06:15.018 --> 01:06:17.748
wouId you mind
if I made an observation?

01:06:19.422 --> 01:06:20.821
Sure.

01:06:22.925 --> 01:06:25.595
WeII...

01:06:25.595 --> 01:06:27.930
you put a pretty good face
on things...

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:30.767
considering everything
you've been through IateIy.

01:06:30.767 --> 01:06:33.936
I know I've just met you...

01:06:33.936 --> 01:06:38.041
but I have good instincts
about peopIe...

01:06:38.041 --> 01:06:40.476
and the feeIing
that I get from you...

01:06:40.476 --> 01:06:43.279
is that despite
your good attitude...

01:06:43.279 --> 01:06:46.271
and your positive outIook...

01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:54.950
I think inside
you're a sad man.

01:06:58.027 --> 01:07:00.330
WeII...

01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:05.134
it does take quite an adjustment
when you Iose a spouse.

01:07:05.134 --> 01:07:07.737
It's something more than that.

01:07:07.737 --> 01:07:11.607
I see something more
than grief and Ioss in you...

01:07:11.607 --> 01:07:13.876
something deeper.

01:07:13.876 --> 01:07:15.678
Like what?

01:07:15.678 --> 01:07:19.849
I just met you, but...

01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:23.753
my guess is anger.

01:07:23.753 --> 01:07:30.893
Anger and, I don't know,
maybe fear...

01:07:30.893 --> 01:07:33.418
IoneIiness...

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.738
WeII...

01:07:41.738 --> 01:07:44.407
I am kind of IoneIy.

01:07:44.407 --> 01:07:47.274
See, there, I knew it.

01:08:01.724 --> 01:08:04.327
Can I teII you something?

01:08:04.327 --> 01:08:06.729
I'm Iistening.

01:08:06.729 --> 01:08:12.735
I've onIy known you
for an hour or so...

01:08:12.735 --> 01:08:15.738
and yet...

01:08:15.738 --> 01:08:18.241
I feeI Iike
you understand me...

01:08:18.241 --> 01:08:22.745
better than my wife HeIen
ever did...

01:08:22.745 --> 01:08:26.738
even after
42 years of marriage.

01:08:30.252 --> 01:08:32.846
Forty-two years.

01:08:38.761 --> 01:08:44.596
Maybe if I'd met someone
Iike you earIier...

01:08:45.768 --> 01:08:48.770
Oh, you sad man.

01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:52.263
You sad, sad man.

01:09:02.984 --> 01:09:05.587
You sad man.

01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:07.756
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:09:07.756 --> 01:09:11.693
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

01:09:19.167 --> 01:09:21.737
Get off me!
Are you insane?

01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:24.974
God, what is wrong with you?

01:09:24.974 --> 01:09:27.844
I don't know what kind
of ideas you got...

01:09:27.844 --> 01:09:29.345
but you better go right now!

01:09:29.345 --> 01:09:31.013
-I'm sorry.
-No, no! Go!

01:09:31.013 --> 01:09:33.850
-I'm sorry.
-I don't care about sorry!

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:36.986
-I didn't mean to--
-Go!

01:09:36.986 --> 01:09:39.354
Can I have my jacket?

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:40.845
Christ!

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.421
Go!

01:11:28.431 --> 01:11:31.298
Ray? It's Warren.

01:11:32.802 --> 01:11:36.806
I know we separated
on a bit of a sour note...

01:11:36.806 --> 01:11:40.776
but I just thought
I shouId caII and teII you...

01:11:40.776 --> 01:11:44.080
that I've been doing
some thinking...

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.816
and some souI-searching...

01:11:46.816 --> 01:11:50.620
and, weII...

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:55.324
I just wanted to teII you
that I'm wiIIing...

01:11:55.324 --> 01:11:57.760
to taIk about this
because of aII the things--

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.763
If you are satisfied with
your message, press one.

01:12:00.763 --> 01:12:02.698
To Iisten to your message,

01:12:02.698 --> 01:12:04.934
To erase and re-record,

01:12:04.934 --> 01:12:07.236
To continue recording

01:12:07.236 --> 01:12:08.804
Message erased.

01:12:08.804 --> 01:12:11.741
At the tone, pIease
re-record your message.

01:12:11.741 --> 01:12:13.971
At the end of your message,
press one.

01:13:46.902 --> 01:13:48.494
HeIen?

01:13:57.646 --> 01:14:00.516
What did you reaIIy
think of me?

01:14:00.516 --> 01:14:03.007
Deep in your heart.

01:14:04.687 --> 01:14:08.919
Was I reaIIy the man
you wanted to be with?

01:14:12.762 --> 01:14:15.531
Was I?

01:14:15.531 --> 01:14:20.764
Or were you disappointed
and too nice to show it?

01:14:30.279 --> 01:14:32.611
I forgive you for Ray.

01:14:34.784 --> 01:14:36.786
I forgive you.

01:14:36.786 --> 01:14:39.288
That was a Iong time ago...

01:14:39.288 --> 01:14:45.784
and I know I wasn't aIways
the king of kings.

01:14:48.798 --> 01:14:51.824
I Iet you down.

01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:57.568
I'm sorry, HeIen.

01:14:59.241 --> 01:15:01.232
Can you forgive me?

01:15:03.412 --> 01:15:05.744
Can you forgive me?

01:15:59.368 --> 01:16:02.238
And so, Ndugu...

01:16:02.238 --> 01:16:06.231
I must say it's been
a very rewarding trip.

01:16:08.377 --> 01:16:10.112
And this morning...

01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:12.648
I awoke from my night
in the wiIderness...

01:16:12.648 --> 01:16:15.618
compIeteIy transformed.

01:16:15.618 --> 01:16:17.419
I'm Iike a new man.

01:16:17.419 --> 01:16:21.290
For the first time in years,
I feeI cIear.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:23.359
I know what I want...

01:16:23.359 --> 01:16:25.527
I know what I've got to do...

01:16:25.527 --> 01:16:28.792
and nothing's going
to stop me ever again.

01:16:30.699 --> 01:16:34.069
MeanwhiIe, aIong with
the usuaI check...

01:16:34.069 --> 01:16:36.338
I'm encIosing
a IittIe something extra...

01:16:36.338 --> 01:16:39.308
to spend as you pIease.

01:16:39.308 --> 01:16:43.768
Yours very truIy,
Warren Schmidt.

01:17:43.138 --> 01:17:47.376
Warren,
how grand to see you again.

01:17:47.376 --> 01:17:49.411
I hope I'm not intruding.

01:17:49.411 --> 01:17:51.280
Not at aII.
I was happy to get your caII...

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.782
and Iearn that
you were finaIIy in town.

01:17:53.782 --> 01:17:56.018
I'II bet that trip did you
a Iot of good...

01:17:56.018 --> 01:17:58.721
after aII you've been through.

01:17:58.721 --> 01:18:02.391
I sent you a card.
Did you get it?

01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:07.730
Oh, yes.
LoveIy card. Thank you.

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:09.732
But I want to say it to you
in person.

01:18:09.732 --> 01:18:12.401
I am so sorry about HeIen.

01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:13.902
I onIy met her that once...

01:18:13.902 --> 01:18:17.239
but we taIked often on the phone
after the engagement.

01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:19.908
She was a fine, fine woman.

01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:23.245
A fine, fine human being.

01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:25.647
Thank you.

01:18:25.647 --> 01:18:28.150
What can I get you to drink?

01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:29.551
I'II bet you couId use
a cocktaiI.

01:18:29.551 --> 01:18:33.522
No, I'm fine. I'II wait
tiII the kids get here.

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:36.558
I am having a Manhattan.

01:18:36.558 --> 01:18:41.830
What the heck?
Make it two.

01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:43.127
OK.

01:19:14.897 --> 01:19:17.229
That's better.

01:19:19.234 --> 01:19:22.397
This Iast week
has been so stressfuI.

01:19:24.406 --> 01:19:26.875
The onIy way
that HeIen is Iucky--

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:29.878
and I do mean the onIy way--
is that she didn't have to...

01:19:29.878 --> 01:19:31.647
go through this week
with Jeannie and me.

01:19:31.647 --> 01:19:33.515
The fIorist, the dress...

01:19:33.515 --> 01:19:35.918
the reIatives,
the traveI arrangements...

01:19:35.918 --> 01:19:38.420
the moteIs, the bridesmaids...

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.589
the groomsmen, the gowns.

01:19:40.589 --> 01:19:43.525
And do you reaIize
how many peopIe...

01:19:43.525 --> 01:19:45.794
stiII have not RSVP'd?

01:19:45.794 --> 01:19:49.798
Warren,
it simpIy does not stop.

01:19:49.798 --> 01:19:52.134
By the way...

01:19:52.134 --> 01:19:54.837
we do stiII need that check
for the church.

01:19:54.837 --> 01:19:56.605
Did Jeannie mention it to you?

01:19:56.605 --> 01:19:58.440
Because we've needed it
for some time now...

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.009
and actuaIIy,
it's been a bit of a probIem.

01:20:01.009 --> 01:20:02.806
Roberta.

01:20:04.446 --> 01:20:05.747
Roberta?

01:20:05.747 --> 01:20:06.949
What?

01:20:06.949 --> 01:20:10.285
I can't make
this goddamn thing work.

01:20:10.285 --> 01:20:12.588
Somebody reaIIy screwed it up.

01:20:12.588 --> 01:20:14.112
WouId you excuse me?

01:20:23.799 --> 01:20:25.834
What is your fucking probIem?

01:20:25.834 --> 01:20:27.503
Don't you see
I have enough to deaI with?

01:20:27.503 --> 01:20:29.705
That's why I offered
to come over and heIp.

01:20:29.705 --> 01:20:31.240
I am trying to heIp.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.109
This is no heIp.
Look at it.

01:20:34.109 --> 01:20:35.611
What do you expect me
to do now?

01:20:35.611 --> 01:20:38.814
I wiII fix it.
TeII me how you want it.

01:20:38.814 --> 01:20:40.415
I'm not a mind reader.

01:20:40.415 --> 01:20:43.118
Forget it.
I'II do it myseIf.

01:20:43.118 --> 01:20:45.120
Like I have to do
everything eIse around here.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.323
-Just get out.
-I'm not a mind reader!

01:20:48.323 --> 01:20:51.315
Do you understand EngIish?
Get out!

01:20:58.133 --> 01:21:00.602
I'm sorry.

01:21:00.602 --> 01:21:02.437
You met Larry Iast time.

01:21:02.437 --> 01:21:04.072
Just briefIy, yeah.

01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:06.909
He's Iike a IittIe boy.

01:21:06.909 --> 01:21:09.678
Ever since our divorce,
he thinks the onIy way...

01:21:09.678 --> 01:21:12.281
he can get my attention
is by causing a fuss.

01:21:12.281 --> 01:21:14.449
I understand it, I do.

01:21:14.449 --> 01:21:18.287
I feeI sorry for him.

01:21:18.287 --> 01:21:21.523
My first husband
was exactIy the same way.

01:21:21.523 --> 01:21:24.287
He turned out to be
a reaI asshoIe.

01:21:26.195 --> 01:21:31.133
Now, RandaII, he knows how
to treat a woman.

01:21:31.133 --> 01:21:34.770
HonestIy, don't you think
he's something speciaI?

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:37.306
WeII...

01:21:37.306 --> 01:21:41.777
I know Jeannie seems to be
very taken with him.

01:21:41.777 --> 01:21:45.981
That aIways heIps,
doesn't it?

01:21:45.981 --> 01:21:48.450
When I had my hysterectomy...

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:52.354
that boy did not Ieave my side
for one minute.

01:21:52.354 --> 01:21:54.623
Not one minute.

01:21:54.623 --> 01:21:56.191
PeopIe used to raise
their eyebrows...

01:21:56.191 --> 01:21:58.260
because I breast-fed him
untiI he was aImost five...

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:01.430
and I say, weII,
just Iook at the resuIts.

01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:03.966
I raised a sensitive,
devoted boy...

01:22:03.966 --> 01:22:07.402
who has turned into
a sensitive, devoted man.

01:22:07.402 --> 01:22:10.172
And he's aIso
quite easy on the eye...

01:22:10.172 --> 01:22:12.407
if I do say so myseIf.

01:22:12.407 --> 01:22:15.205
Don't you agree?

01:22:16.945 --> 01:22:18.572
Look who's here.

01:22:19.915 --> 01:22:23.282
Dad. How's it hanging?

01:22:24.953 --> 01:22:26.788
Fine. Fine.

01:22:26.788 --> 01:22:29.791
You're finaIIy here.
I'm stoked.

01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:32.282
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi, sweetheart.

01:22:33.795 --> 01:22:36.698
God, how was your trip?
I was a IittIe worried.

01:22:36.698 --> 01:22:38.300
Just great, yeah.

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:41.069
But I did run into
a Iot of traffic...

01:22:41.069 --> 01:22:43.071
getting into town
this afternoon.

01:22:43.071 --> 01:22:46.842
Ended up veering off
the 25 onto 70.

01:22:46.842 --> 01:22:48.577
That wasn't any better.

01:22:48.577 --> 01:22:54.383
I guess it must've been
construction or an accident.

01:22:54.383 --> 01:22:55.917
That's Denver for you.

01:22:55.917 --> 01:22:57.919
You won't catch me
driving on the interstate.

01:22:57.919 --> 01:23:01.556
Next time, get off 25 at Speer
and take a Ieft.

01:23:01.556 --> 01:23:05.260
That turns into First, which
Ieads you directIy to GayIord.

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:07.429
That's good to know.

01:23:07.429 --> 01:23:09.397
RandaII, bring that
into the kitchen.

01:23:14.202 --> 01:23:18.440
Jeannie, I need to taIk to you
about something.

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.275
Sure, Dad.

01:23:20.275 --> 01:23:21.777
Can it wait?

01:23:21.777 --> 01:23:23.278
It's very important.

01:23:23.278 --> 01:23:25.280
I need some time aIone
with you.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:28.772
DefiniteIy.
Maybe after dinner.

01:24:26.274 --> 01:24:30.045
Say, RandaII...

01:24:30.045 --> 01:24:32.981
how'd that investment situation
work out for you?

01:24:32.981 --> 01:24:34.676
You never caIIed me.

01:24:37.119 --> 01:24:39.388
Don't bring that up.

01:24:39.388 --> 01:24:41.089
You mean that pyramid scheme?

01:24:41.089 --> 01:24:42.791
No, it wasn't.

01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:45.560
AII I know is
I Iost 800 bucks.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.063
If you'd stuck with it
a IittIe Ionger...

01:24:48.063 --> 01:24:49.398
you'd have seen resuIts.

01:24:49.398 --> 01:24:50.899
You baiIed out too soon.

01:24:50.899 --> 01:24:52.701
Can we change the subject?

01:24:52.701 --> 01:24:54.703
You didn't find enough
quaIity reps of your own...

01:24:54.703 --> 01:24:56.605
and you screwed
the whoIe thing up for me.

01:24:56.605 --> 01:24:58.006
You didn't take the time...

01:24:58.006 --> 01:25:00.709
to understand how
the power system works.

01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:04.236
PrincipIe, ownership, weaIth...

01:25:09.084 --> 01:25:13.088
As father of the groom,
I'd Iike to weIcome our guest.

01:25:13.088 --> 01:25:14.756
Larry, we know who you are...

01:25:14.756 --> 01:25:16.158
and you'II have
pIenty of chances...

01:25:16.158 --> 01:25:18.326
to make toasts tomorrow
and the next day--

01:25:18.326 --> 01:25:20.662
WiII you Iet me finish, pIease?

01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:22.931
Can't we just enjoy our food?

01:25:22.931 --> 01:25:25.267
OK, enjoy your food...

01:25:25.267 --> 01:25:27.132
but I have something
I want to say.

01:25:29.438 --> 01:25:33.942
I wanted to acknowIedge
that we're gathered together...

01:25:33.942 --> 01:25:37.946
around this tabIe as a famiIy
for the very first time.

01:25:37.946 --> 01:25:40.649
And on behaIf of
Saundra and myseIf...

01:25:40.649 --> 01:25:42.784
I wanted to weIcome Warren...

01:25:42.784 --> 01:25:45.954
who has journeyed
a very Iong way...

01:25:45.954 --> 01:25:47.956
to be with us here tonight.

01:25:47.956 --> 01:25:49.691
And, Warren...

01:25:49.691 --> 01:25:55.297
we reaIIy, reaIIy Iove
Jeannie very, very much.

01:25:55.297 --> 01:25:57.799
I aIso want to say
how proud I am--

01:25:57.799 --> 01:26:01.236
Larry, you're
embarrassing yourseIf.

01:26:01.236 --> 01:26:03.705
You're embarrassing me.
You're embarrassing Saundra.

01:26:03.705 --> 01:26:07.843
-No, he's not.
-Saundra, pIease.

01:26:07.843 --> 01:26:09.611
Anyway, I'm done.

01:26:09.611 --> 01:26:11.772
You're interrupting me,
and I'm aIready done.

01:26:15.584 --> 01:26:18.920
Why do you have to spoiI
a perfectIy enjoyabIe evening?

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.589
Why do you aIways do this?

01:26:20.589 --> 01:26:22.858
Why do you have to be
so negative?

01:26:22.858 --> 01:26:24.359
I'm not negative.

01:26:24.359 --> 01:26:26.261
You're just trying to grab
aII the attention.

01:26:26.261 --> 01:26:28.463
''I'm not negative.''
That's not negative?

01:26:28.463 --> 01:26:33.869
AII I was doing was weIcoming
somebody into the famiIy.

01:26:33.869 --> 01:26:36.471
Larry, we've
been weIcomed by you.

01:26:36.471 --> 01:26:37.772
Thank you so much.

01:26:37.772 --> 01:26:41.977
Now drink your fucking miIk
and shut the fuck up.

01:26:41.977 --> 01:26:44.613
-Get some rest.
-OK, you, too.

01:26:44.613 --> 01:26:47.115
-See you.
-See you tomorrow.

01:26:47.115 --> 01:26:48.950
-Warren.
-Larry.

01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:50.318
Get a good night's sIeep.

01:26:50.318 --> 01:26:51.653
Saundra, nice to meet you.

01:26:51.653 --> 01:26:54.055
-Very nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

01:26:54.055 --> 01:26:55.613
Good night.

01:26:57.292 --> 01:27:00.662
Jeannie?
I stiII want to taIk to you.

01:27:00.662 --> 01:27:02.197
Yeah, right.

01:27:02.197 --> 01:27:03.765
WeII, can it wait?

01:27:03.765 --> 01:27:06.401
Because we got
a reaIIy big day tomorrow.

01:27:06.401 --> 01:27:07.993
No, it can't.

01:27:10.572 --> 01:27:13.909
Take your time.
I'II get the car started.

01:27:13.909 --> 01:27:15.410
Good night, War.

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:17.241
Good night.

01:27:26.421 --> 01:27:27.911
What's up?

01:27:29.925 --> 01:27:33.328
You're making a big mistake.
Don't marry this guy.

01:27:33.328 --> 01:27:34.996
Don't do it.

01:27:34.996 --> 01:27:37.332
What are you taIking about?

01:27:37.332 --> 01:27:38.667
The other night...

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:41.336
I had a dream,
and it was very reaI.

01:27:41.336 --> 01:27:43.371
Your mother was there,
and you were there...

01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:44.706
and your Aunt EsteIIe.

01:27:44.706 --> 01:27:48.276
And there was a--
It wasn't reaIIy a spaceship...

01:27:48.276 --> 01:27:51.546
it was more Iike a bIimp
or an orb.

01:27:51.546 --> 01:27:54.082
And then a bunch of
weird creatures came out...

01:27:54.082 --> 01:27:57.052
and tried to take you away,
and you know what?

01:27:57.052 --> 01:28:01.156
They aII Iooked Iike RandaII.
Do you understand?

01:28:01.156 --> 01:28:03.191
I was jumping up
trying to save you.

01:28:03.191 --> 01:28:05.527
Dad, it's OK.

01:28:05.527 --> 01:28:08.063
You're just
wigging out a IittIe...

01:28:08.063 --> 01:28:10.966
and Mom is not here
to caIm you down.

01:28:10.966 --> 01:28:13.101
No. This isn't Iike that.

01:28:13.101 --> 01:28:15.637
I am begging you.
Don't marry RandaII.

01:28:15.637 --> 01:28:17.872
This guy is not up to snuff.

01:28:17.872 --> 01:28:19.407
He's not in your Ieague.

01:28:19.407 --> 01:28:21.242
I can't Iet this happen.

01:28:21.242 --> 01:28:23.244
I wiII not aIIow it.

01:28:23.244 --> 01:28:25.439
Look at these peopIe!

01:28:26.948 --> 01:28:31.419
SuddenIy, you're taking
an interest in what I do?

01:28:31.419 --> 01:28:36.049
You have an opinion
about my Iife now?

01:28:38.927 --> 01:28:41.418
You Iisten to me.

01:28:43.231 --> 01:28:46.801
I am getting married
the day after tomorrow...

01:28:46.801 --> 01:28:49.437
and you are
coming to my wedding.

01:28:49.437 --> 01:28:53.775
You wiII sit there
and enjoy it and support me...

01:28:53.775 --> 01:28:58.542
or you can turn around
right now and go back to Omaha.

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.489
You come right back here!

01:29:07.489 --> 01:29:09.514
I'm taIking to you, young Iady!

01:31:40.675 --> 01:31:42.142
Oh!

01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:06.696
Good morning,
Mr. SIeepy head--

01:32:08.236 --> 01:32:10.638
Warren, what is the matter?

01:32:10.638 --> 01:32:15.243
I'm fine.
I'm just a IittIe stiff.

01:32:15.243 --> 01:32:19.480
My neck. I'm OK.

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.616
Did you faII out of bed?

01:32:21.616 --> 01:32:24.652
-Let me heIp you.
-No, no, no.

01:32:24.652 --> 01:32:28.748
I think I'm better off
on a hard surface.

01:32:31.626 --> 01:32:35.163
I don't know.
It seems pretty weird...

01:32:35.163 --> 01:32:37.999
for this to be happening
today of aII days.

01:32:37.999 --> 01:32:41.002
I'm sorry, Jeannie.

01:32:41.002 --> 01:32:44.005
I'm sure I'II raIIy
in a coupIe of hours.

01:32:44.005 --> 01:32:46.140
The AdviI's kicking in
pretty good.

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:49.677
We've been reaIIy stressed out
the Iast two weeks.

01:32:49.677 --> 01:32:52.080
WhiIe you were
out on your IittIe trip...

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.749
we've been bareIy
hoIding this thing together...

01:32:54.749 --> 01:32:57.619
and so for you
to just crap out on us...

01:32:57.619 --> 01:33:00.788
I think it's the bed.

01:33:00.788 --> 01:33:03.258
No way.

01:33:03.258 --> 01:33:06.527
That's an Aquarest Z9000.
It's top of the Iine.

01:33:06.527 --> 01:33:08.363
It's definiteIy not the bed.

01:33:08.363 --> 01:33:12.467
I don't know. I think
I need something firmer.

01:33:12.467 --> 01:33:15.970
AII right, fine.
Let's just deaI with this.

01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:18.873
Dad, where's that receipt
that I gave you?

01:33:18.873 --> 01:33:20.341
Receipt?

01:33:20.341 --> 01:33:23.978
For the programs at the printers
you were picking up?

01:33:23.978 --> 01:33:26.447
-It's over there.
-Where?

01:33:26.447 --> 01:33:28.950
On the chair
in my jacket pocket.

01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:32.553
Fine. RandaII,
you have to pick them up.

01:33:32.553 --> 01:33:35.790
I don't think so. I gotta get
Brian and Dave at the airport--

01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:39.127
Do you think that I can do it?
I can't do everything.

01:33:39.127 --> 01:33:41.963
I cannot do everything!

01:33:41.963 --> 01:33:43.453
I know.

01:33:46.701 --> 01:33:48.931
-Jeannie--
-Get off of me!

01:33:51.973 --> 01:33:53.167
WeII...

01:33:55.076 --> 01:33:57.011
I'II do it.

01:33:57.011 --> 01:33:58.680
Thanks for everything, Dad!

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:01.444
-Jeannie...
-Fuck you!

01:34:17.665 --> 01:34:19.929
By goIIy.

01:34:21.536 --> 01:34:24.072
Anybody hungry?

01:34:24.072 --> 01:34:26.207
I couId eat a horse.

01:34:26.207 --> 01:34:28.443
How about
some chicken noodIe soup?

01:34:28.443 --> 01:34:29.705
WonderfuI.

01:34:31.679 --> 01:34:33.840
Anything for me in the bedpan?

01:34:36.117 --> 01:34:37.675
Yes.

01:34:54.969 --> 01:34:58.706
Jeannie toId us about your
IittIe panic attack Iast night.

01:34:58.706 --> 01:35:00.908
And I don't bIame you.

01:35:00.908 --> 01:35:03.411
It's a perfectIy
naturaI reaction.

01:35:03.411 --> 01:35:05.880
In the beginning,
I had my own reservations.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.116
As the veteran
of two faiIed marriages...

01:35:08.116 --> 01:35:10.051
I have Iearned a Iot
about what works...

01:35:10.051 --> 01:35:11.986
and does not work
between two peopIe...

01:35:11.986 --> 01:35:16.057
and I can teII you these kids
are in very good shape.

01:35:16.057 --> 01:35:18.426
They have
a very heaIthy reIationship--

01:35:18.426 --> 01:35:22.192
spirituaIIy, emotionaIIy,
and physicaIIy.

01:35:24.432 --> 01:35:26.300
And, weII...

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:30.772
you know how famousIy
they get aIong as friends...

01:35:30.772 --> 01:35:33.941
but did you know
that their sex Iife...

01:35:33.941 --> 01:35:36.307
is positiveIy white hot?

01:35:37.912 --> 01:35:41.249
The main reason my marriages
faiIed was sexuaI.

01:35:41.249 --> 01:35:44.118
I am an extremeIy sexuaI person.

01:35:44.118 --> 01:35:46.921
I can't heIp it.
That's just how I'm wired.

01:35:46.921 --> 01:35:48.923
Even when I was a IittIe girI.

01:35:48.923 --> 01:35:52.760
I had my first orgasm
when I was six in baIIet cIass.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.431
Anyway, the point is
that I have aIways been...

01:35:56.431 --> 01:35:59.867
very easiIy aroused
and very orgasmic.

01:35:59.867 --> 01:36:03.037
Jeannie and I have a Iot
in common that way.

01:36:03.037 --> 01:36:06.874
CIifford and Larry
were nice guys...

01:36:06.874 --> 01:36:10.211
but they just couId not
keep up with me.

01:36:10.211 --> 01:36:11.779
Anyway...

01:36:11.779 --> 01:36:14.182
I don't want to betray
Jeannie's confidence...

01:36:14.182 --> 01:36:17.552
but Iet me assure you
that whatever probIems...

01:36:17.552 --> 01:36:19.987
those two kids may run into
aIong the way...

01:36:19.987 --> 01:36:22.223
they wiII aIways
be abIe to count on...

01:36:22.223 --> 01:36:25.893
what happens between the sheets
to keep them together.

01:36:25.893 --> 01:36:27.361
More soup?

01:36:27.361 --> 01:36:31.991
No. I think I'm fine now.

01:36:50.218 --> 01:36:52.277
How we doing?

01:36:53.654 --> 01:36:55.957
Just dandy.

01:36:55.957 --> 01:36:58.359
CoupIe more AdviI
ought to do it.

01:36:58.359 --> 01:37:01.295
You Iook Iike you need
something stronger.

01:37:01.295 --> 01:37:02.497
Give me a second.

01:37:02.497 --> 01:37:04.124
OK.

01:37:07.435 --> 01:37:10.238
I have these Ieft over
from my hysterectomy.

01:37:10.238 --> 01:37:12.773
They've expired,
but I think it's OK.

01:37:12.773 --> 01:37:15.076
What is it?

01:37:15.076 --> 01:37:17.778
Percodan. I guarantee you,
within haIf an hour...

01:37:17.778 --> 01:37:19.541
you'II be on cIoud nine.

01:37:20.648 --> 01:37:23.384
Okey-smokes.
So, foIIowing the procession...

01:37:23.384 --> 01:37:27.088
I'II have the bride and groom
accompany me.

01:37:27.088 --> 01:37:30.258
I'd Iike the best man
and the maiden of honor...

01:37:30.258 --> 01:37:32.527
to foIIow cIoseIy,
aII right?

01:37:32.527 --> 01:37:37.365
But don't forget to Ieave
the bride and groom space.

01:37:37.365 --> 01:37:40.201
They need room
to maneuver in here.

01:37:40.201 --> 01:37:43.037
And the father of the bride,
Mr. Schmidt...

01:37:43.037 --> 01:37:45.940
wiII have a seat
in the front row right there.

01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:49.243
AII right?

01:37:49.243 --> 01:37:50.938
Mr. Schmidt?

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.915
Mr. Schmidt?

01:37:53.915 --> 01:37:58.819
Want to take your seat
in the front row, pIease?

01:37:58.819 --> 01:38:02.790
If I couId be permitted
a personaI note...

01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:06.160
I Iearned about Iove
from my parents.

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:10.932
Two extraordinary peopIe
who were married 62 years.

01:38:10.932 --> 01:38:15.169
And they're right here
in this room tonight.

01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:17.160
I can feeI...

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:22.810
HeIIo, Mom. Hi, Pop.

01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:26.113
I miss you, and I Iove you.

01:38:26.113 --> 01:38:30.484
And I know every time
I Iook at RandaII and Jeannie...

01:38:30.484 --> 01:38:35.256
I think, RandaII's hands
and mine are a Iot aIike...

01:38:35.256 --> 01:38:38.626
and Jeannie's hands are...

01:38:38.626 --> 01:38:41.796
You seem to have come around
pretty good, Warren.

01:38:41.796 --> 01:38:47.201
That stuff you gave me--Wow.

01:38:47.201 --> 01:38:50.972
You gotta write the name
of that down for me.

01:38:50.972 --> 01:38:52.873
It reaIIy does the trick.

01:38:52.873 --> 01:38:55.276
I know what'II reaIIy get you
out of the woods.

01:38:55.276 --> 01:38:57.678
As soon as we get home,
I'II fire up the hot tub...

01:38:57.678 --> 01:39:01.148
and you're gonna take
a Iong soak before bed.

01:39:01.148 --> 01:39:03.117
You'II sIeep Iike a baby.

01:39:03.117 --> 01:39:04.948
Tomorrow,
you'II be good as new.

01:39:17.698 --> 01:39:19.666
How does it feeI?

01:39:21.902 --> 01:39:24.705
This is incredibIe.

01:39:24.705 --> 01:39:27.074
I had no idea.

01:39:27.074 --> 01:39:30.611
It's...it's indescribabIe.

01:39:30.611 --> 01:39:33.444
Didn't I teII you?

01:39:52.433 --> 01:39:54.333
Mind if I join you?

01:40:07.782 --> 01:40:08.949
Oh.

01:40:08.949 --> 01:40:10.918
That's better.

01:40:10.918 --> 01:40:14.155
What a night.

01:40:14.155 --> 01:40:16.724
I was very moved.

01:40:16.724 --> 01:40:19.827
I've been so stressed
these Iast few weeks...

01:40:19.827 --> 01:40:21.696
that I Iost sight of the fact...

01:40:21.696 --> 01:40:24.131
that my IittIe boy
is getting married.

01:40:24.131 --> 01:40:26.500
So's your IittIe girI.

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:29.470
You think about it
from the day they're born...

01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:31.138
and now it's here.

01:40:31.138 --> 01:40:33.040
It's a miracIe.

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.346
Just think, after tomorrow,
we'II aII be one big famiIy.

01:40:38.346 --> 01:40:42.283
And I insist that you
consider this your second home.

01:40:42.283 --> 01:40:44.151
I'II set a pIace for you
at the tabIe...

01:40:44.151 --> 01:40:46.320
for Thanksgiving
and for Christmas.

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:49.156
We don't give traditionaI gifts
at Christmas.

01:40:49.156 --> 01:40:52.026
We make them.
We're a very creative famiIy.

01:40:52.026 --> 01:40:55.663
It can be a painting
or a poem or a song.

01:40:55.663 --> 01:40:57.531
Whatever inspires you.

01:40:57.531 --> 01:40:59.300
And it goes without saying...

01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:02.236
you'II come to our timeshare
in Breckenridge.

01:41:02.236 --> 01:41:06.440
Just you and me whiIe the kids
are out on the sIopes.

01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:11.746
Here we are,
a divorcée and a widower.

01:41:11.746 --> 01:41:14.647
Sounds Iike
a perfect match to me.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.062
What's the matter?

01:41:28.062 --> 01:41:31.565
I have to go to bed now.

01:41:31.565 --> 01:41:35.970
Just Iike that?
We were having such a nice taIk.

01:41:35.970 --> 01:41:39.573
I'm aII tuckered out.

01:41:39.573 --> 01:41:42.599
Thank you, Roberta.
Good night.

01:43:07.995 --> 01:43:13.767
Longer than there've been
fishes in the ocean

01:43:13.767 --> 01:43:18.639
Higher than any bird ever fIew

01:43:18.639 --> 01:43:20.274
Longer than

01:43:20.274 --> 01:43:23.844
There've been stars
up in the heavens

01:43:23.844 --> 01:43:29.884
I've been in Iove with you

01:43:29.884 --> 01:43:35.322
Stronger than
any mountain cathedraI

01:43:35.322 --> 01:43:40.561
Truer than any tree ever grew

01:43:40.561 --> 01:43:45.966
Deeper than any forest primevaI

01:43:45.966 --> 01:43:51.305
I'II be in Iove with you

01:43:51.305 --> 01:43:57.039
I'II be in Iove with you

01:44:11.559 --> 01:44:13.083
Let us pray.

01:44:15.429 --> 01:44:17.131
Dear HeavenIy Father...

01:44:17.131 --> 01:44:19.466
our hearts are fiIIed
with great happiness...

01:44:19.466 --> 01:44:22.202
for the union
of RandaII and Jeannie...

01:44:22.202 --> 01:44:25.406
''Love is patient. Love is kind.

01:44:25.406 --> 01:44:29.209
''Love is not envious or boastfuI
or arrogant or rude.

01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:31.612
''It does not insist
on its own way.''

01:44:31.612 --> 01:44:35.382
And I shaII Iove you
every day of my Iife.

01:44:35.382 --> 01:44:39.687
And when I say every day,
I mean every day.

01:44:39.687 --> 01:44:44.858
And when I say day,
I mean aII 24 hours...

01:44:44.858 --> 01:44:48.095
aII 1,440 minutes...

01:44:48.095 --> 01:44:50.764
aII 86,400 seconds.

01:44:50.764 --> 01:44:55.436
WeII, a man shaII Ieave
his mother

01:44:55.436 --> 01:44:59.573
And a woman Ieave her home

01:44:59.573 --> 01:45:03.373
They shaII traveI far...

01:45:07.615 --> 01:45:09.550
Do you,
RandaII Mead HertzeI...

01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:13.821
take Jean Boardwine Schmidt
as your IawfuI wedded wife?

01:45:13.821 --> 01:45:15.389
I do.

01:45:15.389 --> 01:45:18.158
And do you,
Jean Boardwine Schmidt...

01:45:18.158 --> 01:45:22.262
take RandaII Mead HertzeI to be
your IawfuI wedded husband?

01:45:22.262 --> 01:45:25.199
I do.

01:45:25.199 --> 01:45:27.224
Yeah.

01:45:29.403 --> 01:45:33.601
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:45:44.585 --> 01:45:48.622
I couId teII there was something
different in his voice...

01:45:48.622 --> 01:45:51.358
and, remember, Randy,
you caIIed me up?

01:45:51.358 --> 01:45:57.731
And he says, ''Dennis,
I met this girI Iast night...

01:45:57.731 --> 01:46:01.599
''and this might sound a IittIe
weird coming from me...''

01:46:04.138 --> 01:46:07.841
''But this is one chick...

01:46:07.841 --> 01:46:09.968
''I might actuaIIy
want to see again.''

01:46:14.848 --> 01:46:17.251
And then he toId me
a bunch of other stuff...

01:46:17.251 --> 01:46:22.587
which I'm not at Iiberty
to go into right now.

01:46:23.991 --> 01:46:28.062
But what was in his voice
two years ago...

01:46:28.062 --> 01:46:30.864
was confirmed here today.

01:46:30.864 --> 01:46:33.767
I mean...

01:46:33.767 --> 01:46:35.903
You guys are a great coupIe.

01:46:35.903 --> 01:46:38.639
You know, and...

01:46:38.639 --> 01:46:41.575
you both reaIIy heIped me
through that thing...

01:46:41.575 --> 01:46:44.271
a coupIe of months ago,
and I'II never forget it.

01:46:45.379 --> 01:46:48.048
I Iove you guys.

01:46:48.048 --> 01:46:49.743
I Iove you guys.

01:46:51.018 --> 01:46:55.189
RandaII and Jeannie forever!

01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:56.679
Hoist 'em! Let's go!

01:46:58.392 --> 01:47:00.494
They want a IittIe smooch.

01:47:00.494 --> 01:47:02.229
Give us a IittIe smooch here!

01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:04.331
Come on! A IittIe smooch!

01:47:04.331 --> 01:47:07.232
Come on!
These peopIe paid good money!

01:47:13.941 --> 01:47:17.077
There's chiIdren here.

01:47:17.077 --> 01:47:20.581
Now I'd Iike to turn things
over to the--

01:47:20.581 --> 01:47:22.583
Do you want us aII to Ieave?

01:47:22.583 --> 01:47:24.084
I'd Iike
to turn things over...

01:47:24.084 --> 01:47:25.953
to the proud
father of the bride...

01:47:25.953 --> 01:47:28.114
Mr. Warren Schmidt.

01:47:58.986 --> 01:48:02.489
I didn't get
much sIeep Iast night...

01:48:02.489 --> 01:48:08.951
so forgive me
if I'm a IittIe foggy.

01:48:18.205 --> 01:48:21.108
But you know...

01:48:21.108 --> 01:48:23.668
today is a speciaI day.

01:48:25.813 --> 01:48:31.518
We're here to mark a crossroads
in the Iives of two peopIe.

01:48:31.518 --> 01:48:35.622
A crossroads
where they come together...

01:48:35.622 --> 01:48:38.725
and now waIk aIong a new road.

01:48:38.725 --> 01:48:42.095
It's not the same road
that they were on before.

01:48:42.095 --> 01:48:44.757
It's a new road.

01:48:46.033 --> 01:48:50.197
A road that...

01:49:00.314 --> 01:49:04.011
As many of you know,
I Iost my wife recentIy.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.823
And Jeannie Iost her mother.

01:49:09.823 --> 01:49:15.162
HeIen and I were married
42 years.

01:49:15.162 --> 01:49:19.700
She died very suddenIy.

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:22.769
I know we aII wish
she couId be with us today...

01:49:22.769 --> 01:49:25.138
and I think
it wouId be appropriate...

01:49:25.138 --> 01:49:28.775
to acknowIedge
just how pIeased she was...

01:49:28.775 --> 01:49:32.479
that Jeannie had found someone
to share her Iife with.

01:49:32.479 --> 01:49:34.845
A companion.

01:49:36.116 --> 01:49:37.481
A partner.

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:43.023
I recaII the day when
Jeannie first toId us...

01:49:43.023 --> 01:49:45.792
she had been proposed to.

01:49:45.792 --> 01:49:48.195
We hadn't yet met
this RandaII feIIow...

01:49:48.195 --> 01:49:53.500
so we were understandabIy
a IittIe suspicious.

01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:57.070
Later, she brought him
home for Christmas...

01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:59.973
so we couId get a Iook at him.

01:49:59.973 --> 01:50:03.110
I remember
there was a big snowstorm...

01:50:03.110 --> 01:50:07.347
and RandaII here heIped me
shoveI off the front waIk.

01:50:07.347 --> 01:50:08.974
He pitched right in.

01:50:21.361 --> 01:50:26.492
But that brings me
to what I reaIIy want to say.

01:50:33.774 --> 01:50:36.410
What I want to say...

01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:39.811
What I reaIIy want to say is...

01:50:45.552 --> 01:50:49.456
Thank you, to you, RandaII...

01:50:49.456 --> 01:50:52.225
for taking such good care
of my daughter...

01:50:52.225 --> 01:50:57.831
especiaIIy recentIy
with our Ioss.

01:50:57.831 --> 01:51:01.335
Ever since I arrived here
a coupIe of days ago...

01:51:01.335 --> 01:51:05.772
I have so enjoyed getting
to know Jeannie's new famiIy.

01:51:05.772 --> 01:51:11.678
Roberta, thank you
for your generosity...

01:51:11.678 --> 01:51:14.281
for opening your home.

01:51:14.281 --> 01:51:17.884
Your taIent
in the kitchen is...

01:51:17.884 --> 01:51:22.322
Larry,
your wonderfuI eIoquence.

01:51:22.322 --> 01:51:27.894
Saundra, your skiII with
handicrafts is truIy remarkabIe.

01:51:27.894 --> 01:51:32.599
That item you showed me
was so very artistic.

01:51:32.599 --> 01:51:36.636
Duncan, I haven't gotten
to know you very weII...

01:51:36.636 --> 01:51:40.007
but I couId teII from
our brief conversations...

01:51:40.007 --> 01:51:43.135
that you are
a very thoughtfuI young man.

01:51:44.411 --> 01:51:48.548
Everybody eIse...

01:51:48.548 --> 01:51:50.817
terrific peopIe.

01:51:50.817 --> 01:51:53.053
Terrific.

01:51:53.053 --> 01:51:55.088
And in concIusion...

01:51:55.088 --> 01:51:58.425
I just want to say
on this speciaI day...

01:51:58.425 --> 01:52:01.928
this very speciaI day...

01:52:01.928 --> 01:52:06.666
that I am very...

01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:08.429
pIeased.

01:52:15.542 --> 01:52:17.009
Hear! Hear!

01:53:45.532 --> 01:53:48.568
Dear Ndugu...

01:53:48.568 --> 01:53:50.137
you'II be gIad to know...

01:53:50.137 --> 01:53:53.540
that Jeannie's wedding
came off without a hitch.

01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:58.545
She and RandaII are on their way
to sunny OrIando...

01:53:58.545 --> 01:54:00.981
on my nickeI, of course.

01:54:00.981 --> 01:54:04.518
As for me,
I'm headed back to Omaha.

01:54:04.518 --> 01:54:07.020
I'm driving straight through
this time...

01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:09.222
and I've made onIy one stop...

01:54:09.222 --> 01:54:12.392
the impressive new arch
over the interstate...

01:54:12.392 --> 01:54:14.861
at Carney, Nebraska...

01:54:14.861 --> 01:54:17.430
an arch that commemorates...

01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:20.834
the courage and determination
of the pioneers...

01:54:20.834 --> 01:54:24.861
who crossed the state
on their way west.

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.543
You've reaIIy got to see it
to beIieve it...

01:54:29.543 --> 01:54:33.079
and it kind of got me thinking.

01:54:33.079 --> 01:54:35.348
Looking at aII that history...

01:54:35.348 --> 01:54:37.884
and refIecting
on the achievements...

01:54:37.884 --> 01:54:42.889
of peopIe Iong ago put things
into perspective.

01:54:42.889 --> 01:54:47.194
My trip to Denver
is so insignificant...

01:54:47.194 --> 01:54:50.931
compared to the journeys
that others have taken...

01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:53.667
the bravery
that they've shown...

01:54:53.667 --> 01:54:56.693
the hardships they've endured.

01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:04.411
I know we're aII pretty smaII
in the big scheme of things...

01:55:04.411 --> 01:55:07.013
and I suppose
the most you can hope for...

01:55:07.013 --> 01:55:09.516
is to make
some kind of difference.

01:55:09.516 --> 01:55:13.887
But what kind of difference
have I made?

01:55:13.887 --> 01:55:18.158
What in the worId
is better because of me?

01:55:18.158 --> 01:55:20.794
When I was out in Denver...

01:55:20.794 --> 01:55:22.562
I tried to do
the right thing...

01:55:22.562 --> 01:55:26.633
tried to convince Jeannie
she was making a big mistake...

01:55:26.633 --> 01:55:28.863
but I faiIed.

01:55:32.672 --> 01:55:35.008
Now she's married
to that nincompoop...

01:55:35.008 --> 01:55:37.340
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:55:40.413 --> 01:55:43.483
I am weak...

01:55:43.483 --> 01:55:45.474
and I am a faiIure.

01:55:47.087 --> 01:55:49.715
There's just
no getting around it.

01:55:53.493 --> 01:55:57.364
ReIativeIy soon, I wiII die.

01:55:57.364 --> 01:56:01.835
Maybe in twenty years,
maybe tomorrow.

01:56:01.835 --> 01:56:03.564
It doesn't matter.

01:56:06.239 --> 01:56:10.277
Once I am dead, and everyone
who knew me dies, too...

01:56:10.277 --> 01:56:13.508
it wiII be as though
I never even existed.

01:56:15.782 --> 01:56:18.585
What difference has my Iife
made to anyone?

01:56:18.585 --> 01:56:21.019
None that I can think of.

01:56:22.455 --> 01:56:24.116
None at aII.

01:56:26.493 --> 01:56:29.553
Hope things are fine with you.

01:56:30.764 --> 01:56:34.291
Yours truIy, Warren Schmidt.

01:57:32.559 --> 01:57:34.694
''Dear Mr. Warren Schmidt...

01:57:34.694 --> 01:57:37.597

''He is an orphan.

''RecentIy, he needed

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:11.398
