37:38.860 --> 37:42.260
MOM, IF ANYTHING,
I DID IT BECAUSE OF<i> YOU.</i>

37:42.260 --> 37:45.860
WATCHING YOU THESE PAST
FEW MONTHS BRIDGING COMMUNITIES

37:45.860 --> 37:49.730

THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT IT.

38:22.600 --> 38:26.530
-BUT IT HELPS.
-YEAH, AND I WANT TO BE<i> HERE.</i>

38:26.530 --> 38:30.330

POINTLESS?!

AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.490

ISN'T ABOUT EDUCATION.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.830
NOT ANYMORE.
