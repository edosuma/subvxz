00:09.280 --> 00:11.070
Previously on You...

00:11.150 --> 00:12.550
Everyone just calls me Beck.

00:12.610 --> 00:14.570
And you're Joe...

00:14.660 --> 00:15.570
Goldberg.

00:15.660 --> 00:18.120
People find "the one." I believe that.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.250
I was in love once. Candace.
She broke my heart, Beck.

00:22.330 --> 00:23.460
I should've seen the signs.

00:23.540 --> 00:24.960
But we never do.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.790
Exhibit A. Claudia. Single parent.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.050
You think she knew Ron was a shitbag
when she fell in love?

00:31.130 --> 00:32.049
You're a freak.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.736
So, stay away from Paco,
because if you don't,

00:33.760 --> 00:35.866
I'll grab a steak knife
and I'll cut those freak eyes out.

00:35.890 --> 00:38.220
A guy needs to protect himself.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.390
I had to be sure you're safe.

00:40.470 --> 00:43.640
I just need to know who you really are.

00:43.730 --> 00:45.020
- You're smart.
- Shit!

00:45.100 --> 00:46.400
My phone!

00:46.480 --> 00:48.150
I must've dropped it in the subway.

00:48.230 --> 00:50.780
Except in the ways
you are really not.

00:50.860 --> 00:52.570
Like not locking your phone.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.240
And that means I'm still logged into you.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.676
Maybe we could get a drink sometime?

00:56.700 --> 00:57.700
Sure.

00:57.780 --> 01:01.580
Hell, maybe I'm just a fool in love.
It just feels right.

01:01.660 --> 01:04.250
I'm going to help you get
the life you deserve.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.890
You have questionable taste in friends.

01:06.870 --> 01:08.830
Hey, man, I'm thinking maybe...

01:10.460 --> 01:11.780
You fall for the wrong men.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.050
Get up on the fence.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.220
Beck, were you ever
sleeping with your therapist?

01:19.300 --> 01:21.470
Yes. I cheated.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.390
But it's over now.

01:23.470 --> 01:26.060
What he did to me, one of these days,
he's gonna do to you.

01:26.140 --> 01:29.310
Maybe he'll do
whatever the hell he did to Candace.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.440
I need you to tell me
what happened with Candace.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.626
Why? What does that even matter?

01:32.650 --> 01:35.400
Because there's no evidence
that she was in Italy at all.

01:35.490 --> 01:37.820
No one's heard a single word from her
since she left.

01:38.910 --> 01:39.820
I know you.

01:39.910 --> 01:42.660
You won't stop asking questions
until I do something about this.

01:43.990 --> 01:45.540
What the hell?

01:47.960 --> 01:48.960
I'll call you later.

01:49.460 --> 01:52.500
This, Beck, is between me and you.

01:59.510 --> 02:02.510
Joe! Joe!

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.410 --> 02:27.476
- Move!
- Mr. Mooney...

02:27.500 --> 02:29.266
- Move!
- I was just organizing the shelf.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.460
You think you knew my business
better than I do?

02:31.540 --> 02:35.250
Get in! And you'll stay in
until you understand.

02:35.340 --> 02:37.670
- Understand what?
- Who I am to you.

02:44.220 --> 02:45.220
Joe!

02:58.650 --> 02:59.650
Joe!

03:02.110 --> 03:03.240
Joe!

03:11.120 --> 03:12.120
I'm here.

03:17.590 --> 03:18.590
Joe...

03:24.140 --> 03:25.180
why...

03:27.390 --> 03:28.520
am I in here?

03:30.890 --> 03:32.140
That's good.

03:32.810 --> 03:34.836
Because we're talking.
We're getting it out in the open.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.320
- You hit me!
- I'm sorry.

03:38.570 --> 03:40.030
Beck, I'm sorry.

03:40.110 --> 03:42.240
I didn't want you to freak out.

03:42.320 --> 03:46.870
Joe! I am locked in a glass cage!

03:46.950 --> 03:47.990
Temporarily.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.330
- How long?
- What?

03:53.420 --> 03:58.800
How long are you gonna keep me in here?
If this is just temporary.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.630
Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead. I...

04:03.300 --> 04:06.470
I need to know that I can trust you.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.310
To see the truth.

04:09.390 --> 04:10.980
What truth is that?

04:11.520 --> 04:14.770
Everything I have done,
I have done for you.

04:16.230 --> 04:17.230
Even this?

04:18.980 --> 04:19.980
Even this.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.160
Oh, God.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.410
I wish I knew what you were thinking.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.080
Tell me.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.720
What's in the box? Tell me.

04:45.590 --> 04:47.300
Tell me I'm crazy.

04:47.970 --> 04:52.350
Tell me you didn't kill Benji.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.850
Tell me you didn't kill Peach.

04:59.230 --> 05:00.690
If you knew what I knew.

05:06.570 --> 05:09.200
Shit, Beck, that's right.
You have no idea.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.410
I promised you the truth
and I'm gonna give you that.

05:14.910 --> 05:17.290
Wait, Joe! Don't leave!

05:18.290 --> 05:22.130
I'm not. We're gonna get through this.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.880
Joe?

05:26.130 --> 05:31.430
Joe! No, Joe! Joe! Joe!

05:39.440 --> 05:41.320
That could've gone worse.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.780
I knew you'd be scared.

05:44.860 --> 05:48.070
That's why I tried to protect you
from the truth.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.120
Now I need to protect us from the world...

05:52.120 --> 05:54.370
...long enough to work this out.

05:54.450 --> 05:57.960
So business as usual is the best cover.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.800
As far as your friends are concerned,
you're going off the grid.

06:05.920 --> 06:11.390
And it wouldn't be a true social media
detox without announcing it to the world.

06:17.270 --> 06:18.866
I'll be back soon.
The basement is off-limits

06:18.890 --> 06:22.270
until I finish open-heart surgery
on a first-edition Sylvia Plath.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.820
Nice. What kinda condition she in?

06:25.570 --> 06:27.860
Fragile. Very fragile.

06:29.240 --> 06:36.040
Evidence. Evidence is all I need
to prove to you that I'm not some sicko.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.000
I'm your protector. You'll see.

06:43.090 --> 06:46.050
Let's skip the "nothing to see here,"
get straight to moving along.

06:46.130 --> 06:48.260
No, this is my building.
That's my neighbor, Claudia.

06:48.340 --> 06:49.696
- Your neighbor, huh?
- Yeah.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.656
So then you know the piece of shit
who gave her a concussion?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.140
- Yeah, his name is Ron.
- I know who he is.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.640
That's him.
Why is he not in the back of your cruiser?

06:58.730 --> 07:00.730
Victim insisted
it was an accident.

07:01.770 --> 07:04.480
She has a kid. Paco. Where is he?

07:04.570 --> 07:07.280
I didn't see any children in there.
Probably for the best.

07:13.910 --> 07:17.740
Joe.
You can't leave me in here.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.870
I'm... I'm not. I'm sorry.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.960
It's pointless to try to explain anything
to you without evidence. So...

07:23.750 --> 07:26.300
no more secrets. Ask me anything.

07:30.420 --> 07:34.010
So we both knew Benji was a dick, right?
What you didn't know...

07:37.010 --> 07:39.480
He was a murderer.
He killed an innocent kid.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.730
He's playing dead.
He's playing dead. Oh, shit.

07:44.690 --> 07:48.110
No remorse. I fully maintain
he was sociopathic and dangerous.

07:48.190 --> 07:52.320
Dangerous for you.
And Peach, she was obsessed.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.990
She was hoarding these. For years.

07:55.070 --> 07:58.200
She needed to own you,
to trap you, to make you her pet.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.120
And what happened once she was gone?

08:01.620 --> 08:03.870
You blossomed. You were published.

08:10.010 --> 08:14.430
I get why you'd be freaked.
They're all stuffed in like this.

08:14.510 --> 08:18.060
But they're just mementos, you know?
Like holding onto an old photograph.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.350
Or you wearing my shirt to sleep.

08:21.430 --> 08:24.770
You can't tell me that's so crazy.
It's the stuff of a million love songs.

08:25.560 --> 08:29.900
I know this is a lot. Honestly,
I'm terrified sharing this with you.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.110
But if we're being honest,

08:31.900 --> 08:33.426
your life has been better
since you met me.

08:33.450 --> 08:36.820
You just didn't know how or why until now.

08:38.830 --> 08:39.830
Beck, I love you.

08:40.450 --> 08:43.159
And loving someone means
you will do anything for them.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
Benji's.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.100
I had to burn his body.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.600
And Peach?

09:00.680 --> 09:03.060
She tried to kill me.
That was straight-up self-defense.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.400
- It was self-defense...
- Oh, God!

09:06.480 --> 09:07.770
No, please don't.

09:09.570 --> 09:10.996
- Please!
- No, no, no, calm down. Please.

09:11.020 --> 09:12.836
- Please don't hurt me!
- Please calm down.

09:12.860 --> 09:14.990
No, you don't understand.
Please calm down. Beck...

09:15.070 --> 09:16.256
- You killed them!
- Beck! Beck! Beck!

09:16.280 --> 09:19.070
- You're a murderer! You freak!
- No, that's not true.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.780
- Get away from me!
- No, you...

09:21.370 --> 09:22.926
- Please don't hurt me.
- You don't understand.

09:22.950 --> 09:24.660
I would never hurt someone I love.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.580
Tell that to Candace, you sick fuck!

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
You're not listening.

09:41.810 --> 09:42.810
Help!

09:43.390 --> 09:44.850
Help!

09:46.310 --> 09:48.150
Help!

09:48.810 --> 09:52.480
Help me, please! Please!

10:22.850 --> 10:23.680
Good morning.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.980
- Get away!
- Jesus! It's okay.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.230
What were you trying to do to me?

10:32.940 --> 10:34.690
I was just making it cozy. Look.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.240
You were sleeping so deep.
I didn't want to disturb you.

10:38.320 --> 10:39.320
Well...

10:40.570 --> 10:42.120
consider me disturbed.

10:47.370 --> 10:49.540
Here, I brought you breakfast.

10:50.330 --> 10:53.710
Somehow, being inches
from a bucket of my own pee has...

10:54.420 --> 10:55.960
killed my appetite.

10:56.050 --> 10:58.010
Oh, well, I emptied the bucket.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.930
In case you ever doubt
what I'm willing to do for love.

11:04.220 --> 11:09.430
And you're not gonna want to pass up
avocado toast from Dudley's.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.100
And coffee how you like it.

11:14.650 --> 11:16.690
I always wondered what that was for.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.320
Oh, yeah.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.490
Mooney claims he built it
for secure cash transactions.

11:23.370 --> 11:25.080
I never saw anybody down here but me.

11:26.330 --> 11:30.000
I spent a lot of time in here
when I was younger.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.750
I was always getting into trouble.
Mooney...

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
He...

11:36.170 --> 11:37.670
He was my Mr. Miyagi.

11:40.130 --> 11:42.220
If Miyagi was a Soviet prison guard.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.680
Who am I to you?

11:44.760 --> 11:48.220
- You're an asshole.
- Yes. But who else do you have?

11:49.140 --> 11:52.730
Your father,
who used your armpit for an ashtray?

11:52.810 --> 11:54.626
Your mother,
who never did anything to stop him?

11:54.650 --> 12:00.190
Or maybe you miss that insect-ridden
group home that drove you to my doorstep.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.150
You don't care about me.

12:03.030 --> 12:05.200
This place could be your salvation.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.370
Here, you're safe...

12:10.040 --> 12:13.250
surrounded by
the greatest works of humanity.

12:13.830 --> 12:15.670
With no choice but to absorb...

12:15.750 --> 12:19.050
...the wisdom of better men.

12:19.130 --> 12:21.260
Beck, in the end,
the cage was a good thing for me.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.300
I'm hoping it'll be the same for you.
Look, hence, typewriter, paper.

12:25.390 --> 12:26.390
No distractions.

12:29.390 --> 12:31.730
It's the low-tech writer's retreat
you always wanted.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.230
I feel bad for you, Joe.

12:42.320 --> 12:47.120
Was that pity? Disgust? Empathy?

12:48.330 --> 12:51.410
Beck, I am really
putting myself out there.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.016
The least you could do
is acknowledge that.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.580
Hey! Not today, little man.
Hey! Look at me.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.766
Are you out of your mind?
What do you think you're doing?

12:57.790 --> 12:58.670
Get your hands off him.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.606
I caught this punk trying to steal
the gun from the register!

13:00.630 --> 13:02.590
Okay, all right. It's not loaded.

13:02.670 --> 13:03.510
Oh, it's loaded.

13:03.590 --> 13:04.630
I'll handle it.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.520
Sit. This is not a toy.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.480
- I know. I'm not dumb.
- I think you are.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.060
I think only an idiot tries
what you just pulled.

13:17.150 --> 13:18.690
I know why you want a gun, Paco.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.546
Even if you don't kill yourself
with this thing first,

13:20.570 --> 13:22.860
the second you use it on Ron,
your life is over.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.200
That is the definition of dumb.

13:32.410 --> 13:33.410
I'm sorry.

13:35.790 --> 13:36.870
I know that was harsh.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.000
It's a key to my place.
You can go there. It's safe.

13:41.090 --> 13:44.880
Cool down. Crash as long as you need to.
And we'll talk about this later.

13:54.930 --> 13:57.810
I'm not thinking straight
and it's your fault.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.610
Beck, I can only buy us so much time.

14:00.690 --> 14:03.020
And my patience is wearing thin.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.206
Joe, where have you been?

14:04.230 --> 14:05.530
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:05.610 --> 14:08.490
Let's skip the small talk.
I just want to know if Beck is okay.

14:08.570 --> 14:11.830
- Wait, what do you mean "okay"?
- We had a fight. I haven't heard from her.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.310
Oh, I think it's okay to tell you
she's on a writing retreat.

14:14.370 --> 14:16.290
Yeah.

14:16.370 --> 14:18.830
It's all good, relax.
She's not texting us either.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.210
- Okay.
- I just wanna know she's safe.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.590
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:22.670 --> 14:24.170
What was the fight about?

14:24.880 --> 14:25.880
Uh...

14:28.300 --> 14:31.470
I caught her cheating.
With her therapist.

14:31.550 --> 14:33.010
- No way.
- What?

14:33.100 --> 14:35.890
- Oh, my God. No way.
- Dr. Nicky? Is she kidding?

14:35.970 --> 14:38.850
- Beck!
- Whoa. Joe, I am so sorry.

14:38.940 --> 14:41.270
- Yeah. I'm so sorry.
- So sorry.

14:41.350 --> 14:44.020
- We had no idea.
- I thought we could work through it.

14:44.110 --> 14:46.530
But then she ghosted me.

14:46.610 --> 14:49.650
Wait. When she texted,
she said that her retreat was therapeutic.

14:49.740 --> 14:53.120
- You don't think that she's still...
- I mean, yeah.

14:54.410 --> 14:55.410
Wow.

14:55.830 --> 14:57.000
Wow.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.290
I really thought you two were endgame.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.760
It just kinda shakes your faith,
you know? I don't know.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.050
Do you really believe
that Beck and I are the real deal?

15:09.130 --> 15:12.470
Joe, I've known Beck a long time,
and I have...

15:13.930 --> 15:15.390
I've never seen her happier.

15:15.470 --> 15:18.810
Or, like, more grounded or whatever.

15:20.140 --> 15:22.520
I really think that you bring out
the best in her.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.690
I think she brings out
the best in me, too.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.860
Hey, maybe it's not so bad.

15:26.940 --> 15:29.650
Maybe she's really
on a writing retreat, you know?

15:29.740 --> 15:31.860
Or maybe she's just
trying to dodge that PI

15:31.950 --> 15:33.346
'cause she doesn't feel like
talking about Peach.

15:33.370 --> 15:34.950
PI? What do you mean?

15:35.030 --> 15:37.330
Apparently a Salinger
would never commit suicide,

15:37.410 --> 15:40.160
- according to the Salingers.
- It is so messed up.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.540
They hired this guy.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.420
He's been asking Lynn and I
all of these questions.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.130
He even used the term "foul play."
Can you believe that?

15:48.760 --> 15:52.800
Joe, we both know what you did.
Why are you surprised?

15:56.350 --> 15:59.930
I'm not gonna finish these wontons.
You want 'em?

16:01.180 --> 16:02.180
Okay.

16:07.360 --> 16:08.360
Thank you.

16:10.900 --> 16:14.860
I recommend the ponzu.
The sweet-and-sour is too sour.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.410
Noted.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.580
You haven't started writing.

16:26.290 --> 16:30.460
I'm still waiting for that surge
of inspiration I was promised.

16:33.260 --> 16:37.390
You seem like you're doing
a little better.

16:40.350 --> 16:41.770
Maybe it's relative.

16:42.350 --> 16:43.350
Yeah.

16:45.850 --> 16:49.860
I caught Paco trying to steal a gun
from the register today.

16:49.940 --> 16:51.940
What? Why?

16:53.450 --> 16:55.570
Ron put Claudia in the hospital.

16:56.280 --> 17:01.580
So Paco... I tried talking to him.
I think I just made him angrier.

17:04.160 --> 17:09.210
Well, you got your girlfriend locked up
in a cage, a PI snooping around...

17:11.089 --> 17:12.849
and you're worried
about your neighbor's kid.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.380
I know. It's pretty dumb.

17:16.430 --> 17:17.550
No.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.550
It's sweet.

17:24.520 --> 17:25.520
Joe,

17:28.099 --> 17:29.360
I know...

17:30.730 --> 17:33.490
there's a good heart in there, somewhere.

17:40.330 --> 17:41.330
Joe?

17:42.580 --> 17:43.580
Yeah?

17:47.040 --> 17:48.330
I have to pee.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.380
Oh, no, tell me you're not using

17:58.470 --> 18:01.600
Henry Pelham's cartography
as a seat cover.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.100
Sorry, I couldn't find any Dan Brown.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.640
- Yeah. I'll get...
- Joe?

18:10.650 --> 18:11.650
Can I...

18:12.190 --> 18:16.490
Can I just please use the bathroom?

18:17.070 --> 18:20.320
Please. This is dehumanizing.

18:22.370 --> 18:23.700
You can trust me.

18:45.010 --> 18:49.310
Thank you. Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.210
- Joe?
- I can't.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.540
I'm sorry.

19:13.960 --> 19:14.960
Joe.

19:17.130 --> 19:18.880
Joe, please.

19:18.970 --> 19:23.640
- I'll be back in a little bit.
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.060
I am so stupid.

19:27.770 --> 19:32.020
This whole time, I was wrong.

19:33.190 --> 19:34.940
How did I not see this?

19:35.020 --> 19:38.320
If you see this place as a prison,
that's all you're gonna be, a prisoner.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.160
If you see it as an opportunity
for introspection and growth,

19:42.240 --> 19:44.570
voilà, we have a future together.

19:46.830 --> 19:50.620
You say you're a writer.
I fell in love with a writer.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.250
Maybe you should be writing.

19:54.960 --> 20:00.340
What now, Joe?
You're gonna go jerk off to my panties?

20:01.010 --> 20:04.470
Or do you need to cut someone up
before you can get hard?

20:27.950 --> 20:30.410
How the hell did you end up here?

20:33.750 --> 20:35.226
Your life has been better
since you met me.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.790
You just didn't know how or why.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.460
You paint me out to be this monster.

20:38.540 --> 20:41.670
Someone who could hurt people,
who could do terrible things.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.720
"You used to wrap yourself
In fairy tales

20:48.810 --> 20:50.010
Like a blanket

20:50.770 --> 20:52.520
But it was the cold you loved

20:53.770 --> 20:57.860
Sharp shivers as you uncovered
The corpses of Bluebeard's wives

20:59.360 --> 21:01.440
Sweeter goosebumps as Prince Charming

21:01.530 --> 21:04.450
Slid one glass slipper
Over your little toes

21:04.530 --> 21:05.530
A perfect fit

21:08.410 --> 21:12.790
But by the schoolyard, real princesses
Floated by you on fall winds

21:13.580 --> 21:15.870
You saw the gulf
Between you and the rich girls

21:15.960 --> 21:18.670
And vowed to stop believing
In fairy tales

21:20.000 --> 21:23.210
But the stories were in you
Deep as poison

21:23.720 --> 21:26.970
If Prince Charming was real
If he could save you

21:27.050 --> 21:31.010
You needed to be saved
From the unfairness of everything

21:31.970 --> 21:33.560
When would he come?

21:34.770 --> 21:38.770
The answer was a cruel shrug
In a hundred fleeting moments

21:39.440 --> 21:42.940
The sneer on Stevie Smith's face
When he called you a fat cow

21:43.740 --> 21:47.530
Uncle Jeff's hand squeezing your ass
In the Thanksgiving kitchen

21:48.110 --> 21:53.040
The accusation in your father's eyes
When you told him what happened

21:56.660 --> 22:01.000
From every boy masquerading as a man
That you let into your body, your heart

22:01.750 --> 22:06.050
You learned you didn't have
Whatever magic turns a beast into a prince

22:07.840 --> 22:11.760
You surrounded yourself
With the girls you'd always resented

22:12.720 --> 22:15.680
Hoping to share their power
And you hated yourself

22:16.310 --> 22:18.600
And that diminished you even more

22:20.060 --> 22:24.230
And then, right when you thought
You might just disappear

22:24.320 --> 22:26.610
He saw you

22:27.740 --> 22:30.320
And you knew somewhere deep
It was too good to be true

22:30.410 --> 22:32.870
But you let yourself be swept

22:32.950 --> 22:35.330
Because he was the first
Strong enough to lift you

22:36.750 --> 22:38.710
Now in his castle you understand

22:38.790 --> 22:42.170
Prince Charming and Bluebeard
Are the same man

22:42.880 --> 22:46.510
And you don't get a happy end
Unless you love both of him

22:48.170 --> 22:49.630
Didn't you want this?

22:49.720 --> 22:52.800
To be loved?
Didn't you want him to crown you?

22:52.890 --> 22:55.720
Didn't you ask for it?
Didn't you ask for it?

22:55.810 --> 22:57.930
Didn't you ask for it?

22:58.020 --> 22:59.980
So say you can live like this

23:00.060 --> 23:02.310
Say you love him Say thank you

23:02.400 --> 23:03.820
Say anything but the truth

23:04.650 --> 23:07.030
What if you can't love him back?"

23:10.570 --> 23:13.280
What if you're not the one?

23:13.870 --> 23:17.540
No, now is not the time
to abandon principles.

23:18.750 --> 23:22.330
I have to believe love conquers all,

23:22.420 --> 23:25.840
and if you love me,
it's only a matter of time.

23:27.210 --> 23:30.880
But time is not on our side.

23:33.930 --> 23:36.600
I don't want to think worst-case.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.890
I don't like having to scour your place

23:39.980 --> 23:42.560
for evidence that'd link me
to your disappearance.

23:43.650 --> 23:45.900
It's all starting to feel a little dirty.

23:46.690 --> 23:49.400
'Cause I'm not doing it for you anymore.

23:50.150 --> 23:52.450
I'm doing it for me.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.870
And I'm not a selfish person.

23:59.620 --> 24:03.210
You said you believe
I have a good heart, "somewhere."

24:03.880 --> 24:06.460
I hope you don't mind
if I take a minute to look for it.

24:07.460 --> 24:08.460
Claudia?

24:09.760 --> 24:11.760
Joe. What are you doing here?

24:11.840 --> 24:14.340
I'm looking for Paco. Is Ron around?

24:14.430 --> 24:17.850
No. And I was hoping
that Paco went to find you.

24:17.930 --> 24:19.890
I lost my cell phone when...

24:20.730 --> 24:23.640
Nurses said they tried calling
the apartment but nobody answered.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.400
So you have no idea where your son is?

24:28.020 --> 24:29.440
Jesus, Claudia.

24:30.530 --> 24:32.950
So damn easy to judge, huh?
Who the hell are you?

24:33.030 --> 24:36.450
I'm the only one in this city
who cares about your son, apparently.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.280
Why do you do this?

24:38.370 --> 24:41.410
Why do you protect the man
who does this to you over your child?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.160
Over and over? You're his mother.

24:43.250 --> 24:47.170
Mothers are supposed to protect
their children from men like him.

24:47.250 --> 24:50.170
I don't need a concerned neighbor
bursting in here

24:50.250 --> 24:52.170
and blaming me for my own concussion.

24:55.470 --> 24:58.760
Ron has connections. He's made threats.

24:58.850 --> 25:01.600
You wanna know
why he's still in the picture?

25:02.850 --> 25:06.270
I stand up to him, I lose my boy.

25:10.780 --> 25:13.360
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.920
Yeah, of course you didn't.

25:15.660 --> 25:18.280
You have no idea
what it takes to live my life.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.370
They don't write books
about women like me.

25:22.410 --> 25:23.870
No one would think to.

25:32.550 --> 25:33.550
Joe Goldberg?

25:37.130 --> 25:38.180
Hello, PI.

25:38.260 --> 25:39.140
Have we met?

25:39.220 --> 25:41.390
Hi. I work for the family
of Peach Salinger.

25:41.470 --> 25:44.640
- Just a couple quick questions.
- Okay, sure. Of course.

25:44.730 --> 25:45.890
How well did you know Peach?

25:45.980 --> 25:47.980
He's asking, but he knows already.

25:48.060 --> 25:50.820
Not well. Through my ex, Guinevere Beck.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.030
Well enough to be saddened by her passing.

25:53.110 --> 25:54.506
You been to her house in Greenwich?

25:54.530 --> 25:58.950
That's where she died, right? No, no.
I heard about it through Beck.

25:59.030 --> 26:02.540
I know that Peach was having a hard time
when they were out there. Um...

26:03.240 --> 26:05.450
Yeah. I think you should talk to Beck.

26:05.540 --> 26:07.420
I've been trying to
get ahold of Beck, actually.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.750
Yeah, well, we broke up...

26:11.840 --> 26:14.710
so I'm not really in touch.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.736
In fact, if you found me, that means
you probably found Lynn, Beck's friend.

26:17.760 --> 26:18.760
She's the one to ask.

26:18.840 --> 26:22.850
Beck, she might be out of town, writing.
She does that.

26:22.930 --> 26:25.730
So, good luck. It was nice to meet you.

26:25.810 --> 26:28.310
You spend a lot of time at her place
when she's out of town?

26:28.890 --> 26:30.310
Shit.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.310
Well, I...

26:31.400 --> 26:32.400
He saw me.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.570
I still have a key.
No, in fact, I had a key.

26:35.650 --> 26:37.070
I returned it last night.

26:40.110 --> 26:42.030
Should I be worried?
Are you following me?

26:42.120 --> 26:43.990
Your ex ever tell you
that Peach had a stalker?

26:45.370 --> 26:50.080
I mean, I know... I remember
the awful Central Park incident.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.670
Peach was attacked, right?

26:51.750 --> 26:54.186
But I wasn't aware it was anything
more than a random robbery.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.971
The same individual may have been
in the house the weekend Peach died.

26:57.720 --> 26:58.800
Seriously?

26:58.880 --> 27:01.720
Found an item.
We're testing it for DNA now.

27:02.220 --> 27:03.220
Wow.

27:06.350 --> 27:07.390
That would be crazy.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.640
I forgot the goddamn jar.

27:09.730 --> 27:12.730
Well, if it's true,
I hope you find the guy.

27:12.810 --> 27:14.520
I should've pissed myself.

27:15.230 --> 27:16.980
Let me know if there's anything I can do.

27:17.610 --> 27:20.860
Thanks, Joe. You mind calling
if you think of anything else?

27:22.240 --> 27:23.240
Yeah.

27:23.820 --> 27:25.580
And does urine even hold DNA?

27:25.660 --> 27:27.830
Will do, Ross. Yeah.

27:28.620 --> 27:31.290
One thing I learned
from my own time in a cage, Beck.

27:31.870 --> 27:34.040
Never let yourself panic.

27:34.130 --> 27:39.010
No matter how bad it is, you find a way
to stay calm and keep your wits.

27:58.860 --> 28:01.570
I've been stupid to be mad.

28:02.200 --> 28:05.910
I messed up,
and you're trying to help me do better.

28:08.370 --> 28:09.790
I know it's hard to understand,

28:11.080 --> 28:15.250
but sometimes we do difficult things
out of caring for someone.

28:22.380 --> 28:24.760
I know the demons that drive you.

28:25.720 --> 28:26.970
I have them, too.

28:28.220 --> 28:29.720
It takes discipline...

28:31.890 --> 28:33.140
to prevail.

28:34.310 --> 28:38.360
That's why I work you so hard,
why I demand perfection.

28:38.940 --> 28:41.570
My love for the books. Respect.

28:41.650 --> 28:46.160
I'm trying to teach you a code to live by
so that you don't end up like your father.

28:47.490 --> 28:50.040
And when I fail, you lock me in.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.370
Exactly.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.370
Because I love you.

28:54.870 --> 28:56.540
I only hope it'll be enough.

28:56.630 --> 28:57.630
Hey.

29:01.590 --> 29:06.680
Hey, I'm sorry
that I went a little crazy before.

29:10.060 --> 29:11.350
What's for dinner?

29:22.570 --> 29:25.650
What's wrong? What happened?

29:25.740 --> 29:28.120
You remember the PI?
He paid a visit.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.370
You should've seen him.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.950
I don't think he bought a word I said.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.300
I'm not a killer.

29:43.260 --> 29:45.050
I didn't plan this.

29:46.130 --> 29:49.970
If I was some premeditated,
cold-blooded monster,

29:50.050 --> 29:53.410
I wouldn't have missed anything that would
come back to bite me in the ass like this.

29:55.390 --> 29:56.390
What did you miss?

29:58.190 --> 29:59.060
It doesn't matter.

29:59.150 --> 30:01.830
Unless it does, in which case you'll know
because I'll go to prison.

30:02.690 --> 30:04.650
You might get exactly what you want.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.450
I'll go down for something I did for you.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.530
And you'd love that, right?
I mean, that's what you think of me.

30:14.120 --> 30:17.250
No. That's not true.

30:18.870 --> 30:24.380
You're not a monster, Joe.
I know I've said some stuff, but...

30:24.960 --> 30:28.010
Come on, you can't expect me to be chill.
I mean, look at us.

30:30.890 --> 30:32.010
For the record,

30:34.100 --> 30:35.470
I don't hate you.

30:38.690 --> 30:43.860
I am trying so hard to understand you.

30:44.940 --> 30:47.700
Can you blame me
if I need a little help getting there?

30:53.450 --> 30:54.450
What about Paco?

30:56.040 --> 30:57.080
What about Paco?

30:57.160 --> 30:59.370
If you go to jail,
the kid is screwed, right?

30:59.460 --> 31:01.170
You think that's what I want?

31:01.250 --> 31:03.960
You're the only person
who is there for him.

31:04.040 --> 31:08.760
I think about what happens to people
who don't have anyone.

31:10.590 --> 31:13.010
Joe, for Paco, okay?

31:13.760 --> 31:17.140
Let's try and figure out a way
through this so that you can...

31:21.520 --> 31:25.020
So that we can be there for him.

31:27.820 --> 31:31.490
Claudia! Just open the door. I want to...

31:31.570 --> 31:33.070
Just want to talk to you. Just...

31:35.200 --> 31:37.490
Hey, let me in. Just wanna...

31:52.720 --> 31:54.970
You little piece of shit!

32:13.570 --> 32:14.570
Paco.

32:19.290 --> 32:21.620
Paco, come here. I want to talk to you.

32:24.250 --> 32:27.130
Paco, come here. Not gonna hurt you.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.600
- Paco?
- Paco!

32:40.680 --> 32:42.430
Get over here. I wanna talk to you.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.650
Paco, come out here.

32:58.370 --> 32:59.540
You're dead.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.290
Hey, Ron.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.470
- Joe!
- Paco!

33:28.810 --> 33:33.150
Okay. This is what I need you to do
so no one finds out about this,

33:33.240 --> 33:35.200
because people are not really
gonna believe us

33:35.280 --> 33:36.610
about the way it happened, right?

33:36.700 --> 33:38.530
Okay, there's blood in the hall.

33:38.620 --> 33:42.160
You clean that up with soap and water,
and then hit those spots with bleach.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.386
Really pour it on, all right?

33:43.410 --> 33:45.290
Now, this next part
might sound a little weird,

33:45.370 --> 33:47.460
but I think it might do the trick.

33:47.540 --> 33:49.080
See this? It's Ron's phone.

33:49.170 --> 33:51.960
I'm gonna be texting your mom from it.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.720
Maybe Ron's boss, a few of his friends.

33:56.930 --> 33:58.340
So they think he's still alive.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.890
Exactly. So I'm gonna keep that going.

34:00.970 --> 34:03.390
I'm gonna take it far away
from here, get rid of it.

34:03.470 --> 34:07.310
All you have to do is say
you don't know where he is.

34:12.070 --> 34:13.070
Shit.

34:16.610 --> 34:21.449
Ron will never hurt or scare you
or your mom ever again.

34:21.530 --> 34:24.159
And I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

34:24.870 --> 34:25.870
But it's over.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.540
It's all over now, forever. Right?

34:31.880 --> 34:33.090
He was a bad man.

34:34.510 --> 34:35.510
Yeah.

34:37.420 --> 34:38.420
He was.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.760
Does that mean it was right to kill him?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.020
Sometimes...

34:47.810 --> 34:51.270
we do bad things for the people we love.

34:52.110 --> 34:55.570
Doesn't mean it's right.
It means love is more important.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.530
Hey, go home.

35:00.570 --> 35:04.120
I believe that, Beck.
Love is more important.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.870
But the world is a cruel place.

35:06.950 --> 35:11.670
If I get caught for any of this,
I doubt a jury will see it the same way.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.290
And you?

35:14.420 --> 35:15.420
Will you?

35:16.760 --> 35:18.300
There you are!

35:22.800 --> 35:23.890
Read this, Joe.

35:39.650 --> 35:42.410
A blind-verse rendition
of your love story with Dr. Nicky?

35:42.490 --> 35:44.490
Keep reading.

35:54.590 --> 35:56.920
What exactly is this?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.170
It's the story of everything that happened

36:00.340 --> 36:03.510
once I started having an affair
with my therapist.

36:04.850 --> 36:07.930
I was broken and trusting
and I needed help.

36:08.020 --> 36:12.690
And he, little did I know,
he was obsessive and very sick,

36:12.770 --> 36:15.310
and would stop at nothing
to get closer to me.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.610
And if you skip to the end,
there's this part

36:18.690 --> 36:22.700
where I talk about a box of mementos
that I found on Nicky's property.

36:22.780 --> 36:26.530
Evidence. A jar of teeth.

36:27.780 --> 36:33.330
Joe, don't you see?
Nicky is your way out, Joe.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.630
Our way out.

36:36.540 --> 36:38.170
It's perfect.

36:41.380 --> 36:43.010
I get it now.

36:43.090 --> 36:45.010
- You get what?
- You.

36:45.090 --> 36:49.430
You did everything... for me.

36:50.020 --> 36:53.440
No one has ever loved me
the way that you love me.

36:53.520 --> 36:58.190
I mean, you gave me everything.

36:59.610 --> 37:01.570
Let me give this to you.

37:03.650 --> 37:07.320
I mean it. I understand.

37:07.410 --> 37:09.490
I was scared. I could've done something...

37:10.240 --> 37:13.290
something really stupid
when I found that box.

37:13.370 --> 37:14.370
But this...

37:15.500 --> 37:18.590
This gave me time to think.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.920
I hurt you. I scared you.

37:21.670 --> 37:25.430
I understand if you hate me.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.390
I love you, actually.

37:30.760 --> 37:31.930
More than ever.

37:32.020 --> 37:36.520
And I can wait until you're ready.
It's not so bad in here.

37:38.060 --> 37:39.610
You take care of me.

37:39.690 --> 37:44.820
And no one has ever
taken care of me before.

37:45.610 --> 37:46.610
Not like you.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.870
That's all I ever wanted to do.

37:49.830 --> 37:52.910
And when you're ready,
we can take my story public,

37:53.000 --> 37:57.120
and then you and I,
we can go somewhere and start our life...

37:57.210 --> 38:00.920
And I haven't
thought beyond that.

38:01.590 --> 38:02.880
But, Joe, I...

38:04.550 --> 38:09.640
I know that I am better with you
than without you.

38:10.300 --> 38:11.300
Beck.

38:12.850 --> 38:15.850
If you were in here, this would be
our moment to kiss as, like,

38:16.390 --> 38:18.980
the music swells and everything.

38:22.980 --> 38:24.110
But I know...

38:25.570 --> 38:27.570
I know you don't trust me enough yet.

38:28.530 --> 38:29.530
I get it.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.620
We're crazy.

39:23.790 --> 39:24.840
Beck!

39:31.300 --> 39:34.720
Wait, wait, wait, please.
Wait, I know you're angry. I know.

39:34.810 --> 39:38.100
You have no idea what I am,
you fucking psychopath.

39:38.180 --> 39:39.850
I knew it was too good to be true.

39:39.940 --> 39:43.610
What, all the nice things I said to you
while I was locked in a cage?

39:44.690 --> 39:48.690
You actually believe that all of this
is somehow justified.

39:48.780 --> 39:49.610
It is.

39:49.690 --> 39:51.280
You are insane.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.620
You think that you did some bad shit
and that I did some bad shit

39:54.700 --> 39:57.040
and that this is equivalent?

39:57.950 --> 40:03.130
Yeah, I lied. I cheated.
But I didn't stalk you,

40:03.210 --> 40:08.300
I didn't hit you. I didn't kill people.
I didn't do any of this!

40:08.380 --> 40:12.630
There's not a line in the world
that I wouldn't cross for you.

40:12.720 --> 40:15.220
I didn't ask you to swoop in for me.

40:15.300 --> 40:16.536
But you did. Your life was a mess.

40:16.560 --> 40:17.680
Yes, but it was my life.

40:18.310 --> 40:23.230
And I didn't need some sociopath
on a white horse to clean house.

40:23.310 --> 40:28.070
I mean, what gives you the right?
You thought that I would be grateful?

40:31.700 --> 40:32.700
You...

40:34.160 --> 40:35.160
you are him.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.490
You are the bad thing.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.870
You are the thing
that you should have killed.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.380
If you let me out, we can just talk.

40:45.460 --> 40:49.960
You know what I think?
I think that this was all just an excuse.

40:50.550 --> 40:53.630
An excuse to justify
creeping into girls' lives

40:53.720 --> 40:55.970
and violating the shit out of them.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.720
I think you love it. The power.

40:58.810 --> 41:00.270
- You love it!
- No.

41:00.350 --> 41:02.036
- No, I don't.
- I think that this...

41:02.060 --> 41:07.860
this was the perfect excuse
to take out people like Benji and Peach,

41:07.940 --> 41:11.900
who've always looked down on you
and your whole miserable life.

41:11.990 --> 41:13.240
- God, but you...
- No.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.740
You are not special.

41:15.360 --> 41:16.410
You're broken.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.990
I could never love you.

41:21.700 --> 41:25.120
Rot in there, you psychotic asshole.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.790
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life in jail.

41:41.220 --> 41:42.220
Joe?

41:52.440 --> 41:54.030
Help!

41:54.610 --> 41:58.110
Help! Help!

42:00.330 --> 42:03.790
Paco! Paco, thank God. I need your help.
Open this door right now.

42:03.870 --> 42:06.250
Joe, he is downstairs. And he's crazy.

42:07.710 --> 42:08.710
Joe?

42:08.790 --> 42:11.960
Paco, he has killed people.
He's gonna kill me.

42:12.050 --> 42:13.380
Open this door right now.

42:14.760 --> 42:19.140
Paco, open the door!
Open the door, please!

42:19.220 --> 42:22.560
Please! Paco, no! No, Paco!

42:24.720 --> 42:25.720
No!

42:27.270 --> 42:28.650
Keys. Keys.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.330
When Mooney locked me in,
I learned a big lesson.

42:44.410 --> 42:47.000
Hide a spare key so you can get out
of the goddamn cage.

42:50.830 --> 42:53.170
- I didn't want it to be like this, Beck.
- I know.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.210
I know. Just...

42:57.800 --> 42:59.340
put me back in there.

43:47.390 --> 43:49.350
These have been
selling like crazy.

43:49.430 --> 43:50.980
Is it true she worked here?

43:51.060 --> 43:52.730
Yeah, it's true. I knew her well.

43:52.810 --> 43:55.440
I'm so sorry.
It's really tragic.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.110
It's pretty weird when someone dies

43:57.190 --> 43:59.740
and you literally can't get away
from them on the news.

44:00.650 --> 44:03.030
Enjoy the book.
She was a really good writer.

44:03.110 --> 44:05.780
You really were, Beck.

44:06.490 --> 44:09.000
I miss you so much.

44:09.620 --> 44:14.670
It's been a weird four months.
I had to do a lot for you, in the end.

44:14.750 --> 44:19.550
♪ I need my girl ♪

44:22.050 --> 44:26.890
♪ I need my girl ♪

44:28.970 --> 44:33.140
You wrote the story.
All I did was bring it to life.

44:34.350 --> 44:38.360
The story was perfect,
so everyone believed it.

44:42.740 --> 44:44.176
There he is!

44:44.200 --> 44:48.080
Doctor! Doctor!
What drove you to murder Guinevere Beck?

44:48.160 --> 44:51.290
Yes, she was definitely
having an affair with her therapist.

44:51.370 --> 44:52.370
That evil.

44:52.460 --> 44:55.670
You know, our friend Peach Salinger
was trying to get Beck to stop seeing him.

44:55.750 --> 44:58.290
So it's like,
did that psycho kill Peach, too?

44:58.380 --> 45:00.710
I received the manuscript
in the mail.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.590
It was odd, but far and away

45:02.670 --> 45:05.180
the most moving prose I'd read
since Zadie's second-to-last.

45:05.260 --> 45:07.300
It was also the most horrifying,

45:07.390 --> 45:09.600
because I came to understand

45:09.680 --> 45:13.060
that Beck was illuminating
her very own imminent murder.

45:13.810 --> 45:14.850
That's when I knew.

45:15.440 --> 45:17.940
I had to show it
to my literary agent right away.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.990
It's true, maybe not everyone
was completely convinced.

45:22.070 --> 45:23.780
Bullshit.

45:23.860 --> 45:26.990
But you know what? Doesn't matter.
The evidence was overwhelming.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.950
Thanks to your hard work...

45:30.740 --> 45:31.740
and mine.

45:32.450 --> 45:36.420
It was the last thing
we ever did together.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.500
In the end, you couldn't love me.

45:39.340 --> 45:41.090
I feel at peace with that now

45:41.170 --> 45:44.260
because I loved you
the absolute best that I could.

45:45.130 --> 45:48.340
And I gave you what you wanted.
I feel good about that.

45:48.430 --> 45:50.930
I helped you become the writer
you so wanted to be.

45:51.720 --> 45:54.980
Your lurid memoir of Dr. Nicky
was the lead,

45:55.060 --> 45:56.770
but I cobbled that manuscript together

45:56.850 --> 45:59.360
from every one of your pieces
fit to print.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.860
The book is yours, Beck,
and it made you famous.

46:03.490 --> 46:06.650
It's sad you're not here to see it.

46:07.610 --> 46:10.120
But I know you would be so happy.

46:20.380 --> 46:22.920
So, California.

46:23.510 --> 46:24.960
That's great, you know?

46:25.050 --> 46:26.760
You got the job. Paco's gonna love it.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.970
Yeah, I think so. Weather's so good.

46:31.220 --> 46:32.760
So, Ron.

46:32.850 --> 46:36.310
Disappeared into thin air. I don't get it.

46:36.390 --> 46:39.100
But, you know,
everyone knew he was a troubled guy.

46:39.190 --> 46:41.980
He had gambling debts.
Who knows? It's for the best.

46:43.650 --> 46:46.280
I know I haven't always been
the nicest about it,

46:46.360 --> 46:50.160
but thanks for always being
so good to my son.

46:52.030 --> 46:54.450
Yeah, it's nothing. Really.

46:56.370 --> 46:57.660
I'll let you say goodbye.

47:04.300 --> 47:05.300
Hey, Pac.

47:07.050 --> 47:08.050
I'll miss you.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.220
Me, too.

47:10.300 --> 47:14.140
Hey, you know,
it's okay if things are hard sometimes.

47:16.180 --> 47:17.680
You can still be a good person.

47:18.520 --> 47:21.940
And have a really good life.
That's what I want for you.

47:22.730 --> 47:25.230
This is good. A fresh start.

47:28.990 --> 47:32.450
You're gonna put
the bad things behind you.

47:32.530 --> 47:33.530
Yeah.

47:35.330 --> 47:36.330
You, too.

47:41.580 --> 47:43.630
I'm trying. I am.

47:44.250 --> 47:48.970
But I'll admit, it's getting harder
to live with so much heartbreak.

47:50.470 --> 47:54.350
And there are days
I just don't believe in love.

47:55.640 --> 47:58.520
I tell myself to keep my heart open.

47:58.600 --> 48:00.980
That in the end, I was wrong about you.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.940
Every relationship
teaches us hard lessons, right?

48:04.860 --> 48:05.730
That's their gift.

48:05.820 --> 48:10.610
To make us ready for the day when someone,
maybe the one, walks in,

48:11.200 --> 48:13.360
who could truly love us...

48:15.200 --> 48:17.160
and we could truly love them.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.080
Well...

48:22.370 --> 48:24.250
hello there.

48:25.380 --> 48:26.380
Who are you?

48:27.710 --> 48:31.380
You've got that hoodie.
You don't like to be stared at.

48:32.010 --> 48:36.680
But your legs are bare.
You like a little attention.

48:38.850 --> 48:41.430
Okay, I'll bite.

48:54.410 --> 48:56.070
Hey, Bunny.

48:57.370 --> 49:00.200
- Candace, you're...
- Alive.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.160
Yeah.

49:03.210 --> 49:07.500
So, I think we have some
unfinished business to talk about.
