WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:09.667 --> 00:11.167
Ding dong!

00:11.233 --> 00:12.800
We are back!

00:12.867 --> 00:17.733
This time things are gonna be
pure crazy!

00:21.267 --> 00:22.867
Let's get fucking mortal.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.233
Yeah!

00:27.300 --> 00:29.467
You fuck off.
Fucking divvy.

00:29.533 --> 00:30.600
Yes!

00:33.033 --> 00:36.133
We're gonna be the radgiest
we have ever been.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.100
What the hell?

00:43.600 --> 00:46.033
Oh, fucking yes.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.733
Argh!
(shouts)

00:48.800 --> 00:51.367
It's gonna be the maddest
of mad things.

00:55.067 --> 00:56.900
Oh, my God.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.567
This is amazing.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.767
One big, fucked up family.

01:03.833 --> 01:05.266
Cheers!

01:05.333 --> 01:07.933
(they laugh)

01:08.000 --> 01:09.367
I miss this.
Mm-hmm.

01:09.433 --> 01:12.100
It's just not the same
in the house without Aaron.

01:12.167 --> 01:14.800
What's going on here?
Have you missed me?

01:14.867 --> 01:16.933
I haven't got the feelings
that I did.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.033
I've always hoped me and him
could be more than friends.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.200
(shouting)

01:21.267 --> 01:23.367
It's mint to have Gaz
back in the house.

01:23.433 --> 01:26.367
I am single.
Fuck off. What?

01:26.433 --> 01:28.067
I am back and I am single.

01:28.133 --> 01:30.300
Abbie, how do you feel?
He's got a tan.

01:30.367 --> 01:32.700
He's only been here five
minutes.

01:34.567 --> 01:36.767
I wanna know how Abbie
is fitting in.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.200
Scott doesn't give a fuck
about lad code.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.533
Fucking hell, Marty, calm down!

01:47.600 --> 01:51.400
Tomorrow, it's Aaron's fight and
I
can't fucking wait to see him.

01:53.533 --> 01:55.667
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:55.733 --> 01:58.167
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:58.233 --> 02:01.000
Get me in this house
cos I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.833
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.933
I'm preened to perfection.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.233
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.167
I'm cheeky and colourful
and full of mischief.

02:11.233 --> 02:14.067
I could talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:14.133 --> 02:17.167
My quiff's pure lethal
and my banter's pure naughty.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.300
(all) Geordie Shore! Wey-aye!

02:28.667 --> 02:31.300
Last night I was a pure fucking
mess.

02:31.367 --> 02:34.433
I had a fight with Scott
and Chloe wouldn't cuddle us.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.067
I need to sort this shit clean
out.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.833
Morning glory!

02:43.900 --> 02:48.167
How are you so happy? Cos we're
going to Birmingham. Come on.

02:48.233 --> 02:52.500
Tonight is Aaron's fight
and I am literally shitting
myself.

02:52.567 --> 02:55.433
How are you feeling, Marnie,
about Aaron fighting?

02:55.500 --> 02:56.933
Didn't really sleep.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.333
I'm just feeling so nervous
about Aaron's fight.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.600
I just want him back.
I miss him so much.

03:02.667 --> 03:06.767
You're lucky Aaron was training,
cos if Aaron was here last
night...

03:08.767 --> 03:12.233
Martin massively overreacted,
as per fucking usual.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.400
I just hope
that tonight's different.

03:14.467 --> 03:17.567
Whoo-hoo!
Aaron! Aaron!

03:17.633 --> 03:19.467
Aaron!
(all) Aaron!

03:19.533 --> 03:22.733
The family need to keep together
for Aaron's fight tonight.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.767
I'm gonna meditate. Hum!

03:24.833 --> 03:28.100
Everyone keep together
for Aaron's fight. Hum!

03:28.167 --> 03:30.300
I'm going to have a shit.
(chuckles)

03:33.000 --> 03:34.233
Scott.
What?

03:34.300 --> 03:37.067
Going to see Aaron fight, man.
Wake up.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.800
I'm pure buzzing.

03:38.867 --> 03:42.500
Cos one, Gaz is here, and number
two, Aaron's got his fight
today.

03:42.567 --> 03:44.467
What a fucking belter.

03:44.533 --> 03:45.833
Where's Marty?

03:45.900 --> 03:49.733
I actually don't know.
He was smashed last night.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.333
Ended up starting a fight.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.667
Marty's not with the lads

03:53.733 --> 03:57.933
probably cos he feels awkward
about
that kick-off. The little dick.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.767
I'm gonna jump in the shower,
wash my cock.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.433
I'm hanging out.
There's nae scran in the fridge,

04:13.500 --> 04:15.467
all the more reason to get
packed

04:15.533 --> 04:17.733
and get to Birmingham
for Aaron's fight.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.166
Whoo!

04:24.767 --> 04:27.100
Ducks, do not worry.
We haven't forgot you.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.467
Anna has got a duck sitter to
check
in on you tonight.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.500
(all) Aaron! Aaron! Aaron!

04:34.567 --> 04:38.133
We've got overnight cases
packed,
all the girls are fake tanned.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.467
Let's get on that bus,
ready for fight night.

04:41.533 --> 04:43.533
It's going to be a good one.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.000
Aaron! Aaron!

04:48.067 --> 04:50.333
I know how much this means to
Aaron.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.433
He's wanted to do it for so
long.
I can't imagine him not winning.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.733
It takes balls to do what he's
doing.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.133
I'm just scared that, like,
when he gets in that ring,

05:00.200 --> 05:02.700
I hope it doesn't all, like,
come down on him

05:02.767 --> 05:05.200
where he's like,
"Fuck, I'm in a cage."

05:05.267 --> 05:07.000
I just can't wait to see Aaron.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.967
Since he hasn't been in the
house,

05:09.033 --> 05:11.467
it's made us realise how much
I care for him.

05:11.533 --> 05:13.867
Come on, Aaron!
Come on, Aaron!

05:13.933 --> 05:15.933
(indistinct shouting)

05:22.667 --> 05:26.533
We've got to Birmingham and
we've got
ourselves a fucking waxa hotel.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.533
Get in!

05:30.433 --> 05:32.133
Whoo-hoo!

05:32.200 --> 05:35.267
The hotel is amazing.
It's so fucking posh.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.200
I feel like such a princess.

05:37.267 --> 05:40.967
We've got four rooms,
two people to each room.

05:41.033 --> 05:43.800
This is big, isn't it?
This is my side of the bed.

05:43.867 --> 05:45.200
We've got an iron.

05:45.267 --> 05:48.133
Oh, my God,
it's like a proper honeymoon
suite.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.067
What is it?
(both) Mini bar!

05:51.733 --> 05:55.567
Cheers, kid. Cheers to Aaron.
What a belter.

05:55.633 --> 05:58.733
On the go! Wine time.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.333
Let's get ready!

06:01.967 --> 06:03.433
I need to look amazing.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.833
It's the first time
I've seen Aaron in ages

06:05.900 --> 06:08.967
and I wanna look me best.
Where's the toothpaste?

06:13.700 --> 06:16.367
I wanna do something
really special for Aaron

06:16.433 --> 06:18.633
and I wanna get his initials
in my braids.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.967
I want the whole arena to know
how much I've got his back.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.033
All right!

06:26.467 --> 06:28.767
Heya, kid.
All right, son.

06:28.833 --> 06:33.500
I still haven't even spoke to
Scott
about what a complete knacker

06:33.567 --> 06:37.033
I was last night. I need to sort
it
out before we go to the fight.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.400
Cos Aaron's been gone...

06:50.167 --> 06:51.867
Is that an apology Marty made?

06:51.933 --> 06:54.600
Fuck me. The kid's actually
growing some balls.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.300
Consider the bridge built,
you little fuck.

06:57.367 --> 07:00.500
Let's try and keep the fight
to the cage tonight, boys?

07:00.567 --> 07:04.133
No arguments. We're there for
Aaron
and then we have a wicked night.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.267
I don't care what happened
last night.

07:06.333 --> 07:09.600
Tonight is Aaron's night
and I won't let anybody argue.

07:09.667 --> 07:13.300
We'll do the walk.
Marty, you go first. And go.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.300
(laughs) Go on, son!

07:16.367 --> 07:22.167
It's time to go to the arena. I
am
literally shaking. He needs to
win.

07:23.400 --> 07:27.067
(Sophie) Here we go!
Boys, we're the first taxi.

07:28.133 --> 07:29.733
Watch my shoes!

07:30.467 --> 07:33.467
Back in Newcastle,
Chloe dresses like a fucking
tramp.

07:33.533 --> 07:37.900
But tonight,
she is like a gorgeous prom
queen.

07:39.867 --> 07:42.633
Well, I think we all look
fucking stunning.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.167
Gorgeous, gorgeous girls and
boys
in this car.

07:45.233 --> 07:46.700
(Nathan) Only the best.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.167
This is it.

07:50.633 --> 07:52.700
(indistinct shouting)

07:52.767 --> 07:55.400
Get to the arena, we're all
rushing
to get in there

07:55.467 --> 07:57.667
and what... the fuck?

07:57.733 --> 07:59.200
Hey!

07:59.267 --> 08:00.867
It's Joel.
How you doing?

08:00.933 --> 08:05.300
Sophie's boyfriend Joel's here.
She is gonna be buzzing about
this.

08:05.367 --> 08:08.467
Hi. What the hell? Joel's here.

08:08.533 --> 08:10.567
Tonight is gonna be even better.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.400
Let's get in the arena
and get ready for this fight.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.833
(cheering)

08:20.900 --> 08:22.933
This place is fucking bouncing.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.200
I couldn't have (indistinct)
in front of this many people.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.733
This is my first fight.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.600
And the atmosphere in the arena
is amazing.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.500
We're ring-side,
just where I like to be.

08:49.967 --> 08:53.500
I'm looking around this arena
and I'm actually frightened.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.333
What has Aaron gotten into?

08:57.467 --> 08:59.767
When he gets in there,
it's gonna be scary.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.033
Look! Oh, God!

09:02.100 --> 09:04.067
Are you scared?
I'm terrified.

09:04.133 --> 09:07.433
I don't know what I was
expecting.
I wasn't expecting this.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.067
All the fighters
look so fucking scary.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.433
I think the girls thought we
were
going to a boxing match.

09:14.500 --> 09:19.967
No, girls. This is MMA.
You can get knocked the fuck
out.

09:21.567 --> 09:24.767
Oh!
I feel so sorry for Marnie.

09:24.833 --> 09:28.600
She's just started crying. This
must mean she still cares for
Aaron.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.800
So far,
the fights have all been brutal.

09:31.867 --> 09:35.267
People are even bleeding.
I am shitting myself.

09:41.533 --> 09:44.567
The fight is round the corner.
I can literally feel it.

09:46.733 --> 09:49.967
All I wanna do is get in there
and get the job done.

09:50.033 --> 09:52.533
Go on, Aaron!
Go on, Aaron!

09:55.967 --> 09:57.733
Maaron is back.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.633
I'm not wasting nae time, me.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.167
Abbie needs to stop thinking
about Scott.

10:04.233 --> 10:06.067
He will never, ever change.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.100
(all) Geordie Shore! Wey-aye!

10:12.000 --> 10:12.200
.

10:14.700 --> 10:14.900
.

10:20.433 --> 10:23.200
(cheering)

10:23.267 --> 10:27.033
The fight is round the corner.
I can literally feel it.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.333
Looking around this arena,
and I'm actually frightened.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.100
What has Aaron gotten into?

10:32.167 --> 10:36.167
(announcer) "Ladies and
gentlemen...
(indistinct)"

10:36.233 --> 10:39.300
Aaron's fight
is finally being announced.

10:39.367 --> 10:43.233
Last time I felt this nervous,
I was getting my tash waxed.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.133
And that really fucking hurt.

10:46.467 --> 10:49.667
This guy who he's fighting
looks terrifying.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.167
(both) Boo!

10:54.300 --> 10:56.800
Who does he think he is
sticking his fingers up?

10:56.867 --> 10:59.200
I'll get in the fucking ring
and fight him.

10:59.267 --> 11:02.400
"Make some noise for
Aaron 'The Choker' Chalmers!"

11:02.467 --> 11:04.167
(cheering)

11:06.933 --> 11:08.400
I am so scared.

11:08.467 --> 11:11.967
I need to check my knickers
because I think I've shit
myself.

11:13.867 --> 11:15.700
The family are here to support
us,

11:15.767 --> 11:18.133
but I'm so focused,
I can't even look at them.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.033
All I wanna do is get in there
and get the job done.

11:23.233 --> 11:26.000
Aaron walks past us,
doesn't even look at us.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.867
I feel so nervous
that I'm getting emotional.

11:35.533 --> 11:39.167
I'm fucking hyped up as fuck.
I know he's gonna pure do the
kid.

11:39.233 --> 11:42.367
"Aaron 'The Choker' Chalmers!"

11:42.433 --> 11:44.300
(cheering)

11:47.800 --> 11:51.533
Go on!
Go on, Aaron. You can do it!

11:51.600 --> 11:54.333
My nerves have turned
to complete excitement.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.667
I'm literally screaming me head
off.

11:56.733 --> 11:59.267
Go on, Aaron!
Go on, Aaron!

12:05.400 --> 12:09.400
All of a sudden, Aaron just
changes
gear and fucking goes for it.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.633
This is unbelievable. Go on!

12:13.533 --> 12:16.067
Come on, Aaron!
Punch his fucking head in!

12:16.133 --> 12:19.033
Fucking hell.
Aaron is smashing this.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.800
He looks like Kung Fu Panda.
Ha-cha-cha!

12:24.733 --> 12:26.300
Go on, son!
Come on, Aaron!

12:28.000 --> 12:31.500
The lad can't even move.
Time to tap out, mate.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.500
(all cheer)

12:38.200 --> 12:41.000
(Gaz) Yes! Aaron has fucking
done it.

12:41.067 --> 12:44.200
He has won. I am buzzing.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.133
Yeah!

12:49.033 --> 12:52.567
I've won the fight and
it's the best feeling in the
world.

12:52.633 --> 12:56.367
I look over and the family are
bouncing around like lunatics.

12:58.467 --> 12:59.767
Aaron! Aaron!

12:59.833 --> 13:01.767
Go, Aaron! Go, Aaron!

13:01.833 --> 13:03.933
Aaron! Aaron! Aaron!

13:06.300 --> 13:11.533
"Your winner,
Aaron 'The Choker' Chalmers!"

13:17.133 --> 13:19.433
If I'm gonna get the chance
to go in that ring

13:19.500 --> 13:21.567
and give Aaron a hug.
I'm gonna take it.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.533
Open that door, I'm coming in.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.067
Marnie's come in the ring
to give us a cuddle.

13:27.567 --> 13:29.433
Now, that is very cute.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.667
Seeing Aaron in that ring,
all sweaty and muscly,

13:33.733 --> 13:37.100
was getting us so horny,
my vagina was calling his name.

13:42.767 --> 13:45.833
Marnie's just admitted
that she wants sex with Aaron.

13:45.900 --> 13:50.333
The sexual chemistry between
them
two has been going on for weeks.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.433
Maaron is back.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.200
I'm no groupie,
but we need to get backstage

13:58.267 --> 14:00.133
and see Aaron "The Champ"
Chalmers

14:00.200 --> 14:03.767
and give him
the congratulations he deserves.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.400
Fucking legend.

14:05.467 --> 14:06.600
(they cheer)

14:06.667 --> 14:08.633
All the family are running
towards us

14:08.700 --> 14:11.567
and I don't know
who's more excited, me or them.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.900
You was going akka! (indistinct)

14:14.967 --> 14:17.600
I never had any doubt for the
kid.
Do you know why?

14:17.667 --> 14:20.100
He's a Geordie,
and Geordies are hard as fuck.

14:20.167 --> 14:21.933
(indistinct)

14:22.000 --> 14:25.667
I'm so happy for him,
but he fucking stinks of sweat.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.700
Enjoy it?
You did so good.

14:27.767 --> 14:31.200
You were giving digs! I'm never
gonna argue with you again.

14:31.267 --> 14:35.333
Everyone's all over Aaron
and I feel so awkward around
him.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.433
He looks amazing.
I've got butterflies.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.967
I seen him giving you shit.
No-one talks to my family like
that.

14:43.033 --> 14:45.800
What's your plan?
I'm gonna go and get smashed.

14:45.867 --> 14:48.200
Enjoy yourself.
Get back to the house soon.

14:48.267 --> 14:50.567
Aaron's not sure
he'll make it out tonight.

14:50.633 --> 14:53.133
I understand.
Go and have fun with your team.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.900
We'll have plenty of drinks for
you.

14:55.967 --> 14:58.267
Right then, enjoy your night.
Fuck off!

14:58.333 --> 15:01.767
Don't worry. Tomorrow I'll be
back
and we'll party properly.

15:03.233 --> 15:06.200
That's the smell of a fighter.
Bye!

15:06.267 --> 15:09.967
Thank God Aaron won. I cannot
wait
to get to this club in
Birmingham.

15:10.033 --> 15:12.400
Let's just hope
it's as good as the Toon.

15:18.033 --> 15:21.633
This fight has taken it out of
us.
I didn't sleep the night before.

15:21.700 --> 15:25.467
My emotions have been up and
down,
hot and cold. I'm ready for bed.

15:29.933 --> 15:33.300
So, we just rocked up at Bamboo
in Birmingham. It's going off.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.967
Tonight is gonna be quality.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.800
Aaron fucking won, didn't he?!
(they cheer)

15:45.833 --> 15:48.200
We are still buzzing
for Aaron's win,

15:48.267 --> 15:50.667
and even though
he can't come out tonight,

15:50.733 --> 15:53.033
we're gonna celebrate for him.

15:59.133 --> 16:01.300
Marnie might not be coming out
tonight.

16:01.367 --> 16:05.100
It's been mint having Joel here.
He's made the night better for
us.

16:09.133 --> 16:11.967
I look over and Marty and Scott
are friends again.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.467
Aaron's fight
has brung everyone together.

16:22.433 --> 16:25.200
When me and Marty are happy
and having a laugh,

16:25.267 --> 16:27.567
there's no-one
I'd rather spend time with.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.500
I want him all to myself.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.633
You know what it is?
Anything can happen tonight.

16:34.700 --> 16:37.300
After watching that fight,
I'm up for owt, me.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.600
Sorry, Marns,
I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

16:48.667 --> 16:53.000
The world has got to know
that Maaron is hopefully back
on.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.600
Marnie wants to shag Aaron.
Get the fuck in.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.800
Cos his balls will be like
two planets, Mars and Jupiter.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.767
Is that even a planet?

17:17.700 --> 17:21.400
It's good that me and Scott
can chat like this, as friends.

17:21.467 --> 17:23.599
I just want to have a good
night.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.600
This club is absolutely mint.

17:29.667 --> 17:32.967
I didn't realise the clubs
in Birmingham would be this
good.

17:37.033 --> 17:38.467
I'm not wasting nae time.

17:38.533 --> 17:41.100
I've just found a fit bird
and I'm getting her in

17:41.167 --> 17:44.400
I need to blow off some naughty
steam tonight and get buckled.

17:51.433 --> 17:53.900
I know Scott can do what he
wants.

17:53.967 --> 17:58.267
But watching him neck on with a
girl
in front of us really hurts.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.333
Abbie needs to stop thinking
about Scott.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.167
He will never, ever change.
He is such a dickhead,

18:18.233 --> 18:20.233
and she could do so much better.

18:33.333 --> 18:36.767
I know that Abbie's
obviously upset over Scott.

18:36.833 --> 18:40.033
But she needs me and Gary to
tell
her exactly how it is.

18:47.100 --> 18:50.200
Abbie, did you think you and
Scott
were gonna get married?

18:50.267 --> 18:53.033
He bangs birds and fucks off.
He's a prick.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.800
Although I feel like Scotty
has ruined my night,

19:01.867 --> 19:05.067
it's nice to know that Gaz
and Sophie have comforted us

19:05.133 --> 19:07.600
and made me feel like
I am part of the family.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.700
I fucking love Birmingham, me.

19:21.767 --> 19:25.900
I swear down it's exactly the
same as
the Toon, but they talk pure
weird.

19:29.333 --> 19:32.033
I minding my own business
with this bird in the club.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.300
I'm fucking dying to take her
home.

19:38.633 --> 19:40.533
What the fuck? Joel is so
mortal,

19:40.600 --> 19:43.500
he's ended up slipping
a cheeky finger up us.

19:45.900 --> 19:48.033
At least me fanny doesn't stink.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.433
But this is definitely time
for us all to leave.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.467
All right, let's go.
Go on, then.

19:57.267 --> 20:00.667
Love ya. All right, bye.
Joel, do not go back in.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.000
I'd love Joel to come back
to the hotel,

20:03.067 --> 20:07.100
but he's got work tomorrow,
so take your finger and go home.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.400
Babe, what's your name?
Holly.

20:11.467 --> 20:13.400
Holly, my name's Chloe.

20:13.467 --> 20:17.033
Where the hell is she gonna
stay?
There's no fucking room at the
inn.

20:18.167 --> 20:19.867
Hey!

20:20.833 --> 20:22.533
Yay!

20:24.433 --> 20:26.700
I love being a third wheel.
It's mint.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.333
I'm gonna make this so
uncomfortable
for Scott

20:29.400 --> 20:31.433
for as long as I possibly can.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.500
Let's just go to bed.

20:33.567 --> 20:36.333
Scott's thinking,
"Will Gaz just fuck off?"

20:36.400 --> 20:39.000
(indistinct)
She said she wanted a threesome.

20:39.067 --> 20:43.300
Threesome? The look on Scott's
face.
Don't worry, mate. I'm joking.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.633
(indistinct) Threesome!

20:45.700 --> 20:48.367
Not to be rude,
but he's not sharing the room.

20:48.433 --> 20:51.900
And he's not sharing the bird
either. So, ta-ta.

20:55.533 --> 20:57.800
I can smell booze.
Oh, my God.

20:57.867 --> 20:59.900
I can smell it.
We all check on Marnie

20:59.967 --> 21:02.900
to see how she's feeling
while getting midnight scran.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.133
I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm good.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.133
Marnie, Scotty pulled.
Gary's now sharing with Martin.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.233
Chloe will stay with you
or come in with me and Abbie.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.967
We've just got back
and I'm still fucking rocking,
me.

21:20.033 --> 21:21.367
I wanna go on back out.

21:21.433 --> 21:23.733
Birmingham is my oyster.

21:25.300 --> 21:28.267
I getting ready for bed,
I come out the bathroom and,

21:28.333 --> 21:30.300
wait a second, where is Marty?

21:30.367 --> 21:32.900
Where has that little shit gone
now?

21:35.700 --> 21:38.900
Tonight has been pure amazing,
but it's time for Scotty T

21:38.967 --> 21:41.633
and his pocket rocket
to take off. Scotty T out.

21:45.767 --> 21:49.167
Let's get up
and get back to Newcastle. Come
on!

21:49.233 --> 21:52.233
Marty didn't come home
and Scott is nowhere to be seen.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.600
Birmingham, good luck with them
two.

21:54.667 --> 21:57.033
It's Aaron's car.
I am beyond excited.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.967
(all) Surprise!

21:59.033 --> 22:02.800
All the family have gone to so
much
effort. We're gonna pull fit
girls.

22:02.867 --> 22:05.433
There's only one girl
that I wanna pull tonight.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.633
Fuck me, it looks like a mouse.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.700
(all) Geordie Shore! Wey-aye!

22:12.433 --> 22:12.633
.

22:15.200 --> 22:15.400
.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.867
I loved it last night.
We were a team, weren't we?

22:32.933 --> 22:35.667
Yeah, we were.
We actually were a family.

22:35.733 --> 22:38.300
We've woke up this morning
in a really good mood.

22:38.367 --> 22:40.867
Everyone is buzzing
that Aaron won his fight.

22:40.933 --> 22:42.133
That was a memory.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.967
I feel so much better
after coming back to the hotel.

22:45.033 --> 22:48.467
But now I'm ready to celebrate
with Aaron tonight.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.800
I bet you can't wait
for Aaron to get back.

22:50.867 --> 22:54.033
Yeah.
You spontaneously said last
night,

22:54.100 --> 22:57.100
"I'm gonna fuck him."
Yeah. Oh, I will.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.333
(both gasp)
It'll be amazing.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.367
Last night, Aaron looked so
sexy.

23:02.433 --> 23:04.867
So I wanted to have
some sexy time with him.

23:04.933 --> 23:07.567
I think my feelings
are starting to come back,

23:07.633 --> 23:09.567
but I don't know
if he feels the same.

23:09.633 --> 23:12.500
I want him to do all that on me,
but in a sexual way.

23:12.567 --> 23:14.400
With his willy inside of us.

23:14.467 --> 23:16.933
Instead of punching,
it's the willy going...

23:17.000 --> 23:18.600
(laughs)

23:19.600 --> 23:21.900
Morning, roomie.
Hello!

23:23.000 --> 23:25.100
How you feeling?

23:25.167 --> 23:28.567
Like shit. How are you feeling
today
about Scott?

23:28.633 --> 23:32.667
I've been getting upset a lot
lately
and I want it to happen any
more.

23:32.733 --> 23:36.267
I am not letting Scott ruin
any more of my nights out.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.967
Single Abbie is making a
comeback.

23:39.033 --> 23:41.500
I've really enjoyed my time
in Birmingham.

23:41.567 --> 23:44.500
But I feel like
there's no place like home.

23:44.567 --> 23:47.133
And I can't wait
to get back to Newcastle. I
know.

23:47.200 --> 23:50.267
Right, Abbie, let's get up
and get back to Newcastle,

23:50.333 --> 23:52.833
cos tonight is gonna be a big
one.

23:52.900 --> 23:56.167
It's the return
of Aaron "The Champ" Chalmers.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.533
Birmingham has been amazing,

24:00.600 --> 24:05.100
but we need to get back to Toon
ASAP before Anna goes pure
radge.

24:07.667 --> 24:10.867
Marty didn't come home
and Scott is nowhere to be seen.

24:10.933 --> 24:13.000
Birmingham, good luck with them
two.

24:13.067 --> 24:15.567
I would help,
but I've got a bus to catch.

24:15.633 --> 24:17.833
Let's get home. Come on,

24:17.900 --> 24:21.333
In true Geordie style, it looks
like
we're late for the bus.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.600
Scott and Marty
are nowhere to be seen.

24:23.667 --> 24:25.767
They're definitely gonna miss
it.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.633
Where's Abbie?
I'm coming.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.733
Whoo!

24:37.800 --> 24:39.867
We get back
and everyone's knackered,

24:39.933 --> 24:42.067
but we haven't got time to be
tired.

24:42.133 --> 24:44.667
We need to get this place
looking amazing

24:44.733 --> 24:47.167
for Aaron to come back to the
house.

24:50.633 --> 24:52.833
All of us wanna make it special
for Aaron.

24:52.900 --> 24:56.533
We wanna show how much we
supported
him and how much we've missed
him.

24:56.600 --> 25:00.333
I'm gonna bake. Nathan, Sophie
and Chloe are gonna decorate.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.967
Do we have a measuring jug?
Nah.

25:03.033 --> 25:06.800
Well, how the fuck
am I supposed to make a cake?

25:06.867 --> 25:09.767
Gary!
Two seconds.

25:09.833 --> 25:12.267
Marnie wants my help
to bake a massive cake

25:12.333 --> 25:17.833
to celebrate Aaron coming back.
I wanna use duck eggs in the
cake.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.467
Go on.
Put some alcohol in it.

25:19.533 --> 25:23.267
I don't know where Marty and
Scott
are, so if they're not back
tonight,

25:23.333 --> 25:26.233
it'll be me and Aaron.
Which is good, Aaron's single.

25:26.300 --> 25:28.133
And I'm single.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.800
Does that scare you?
No. Really?

25:30.867 --> 25:34.333
As long as he's got time
to give me attention, then I'm
fine.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.267
I hope Aaron's as up for this as
me.

25:36.333 --> 25:40.033
But so much has happened in the
past, who knows what he's
thinking.

25:42.167 --> 25:43.900
Cuh! Ah.

25:43.967 --> 25:46.767
Me, Abbie and Nathan
have decided to make a banner.

25:46.833 --> 25:50.333
But I think it's a bad idea,
cos I can't spell.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.567
It's meant to be capital
letters.
Is that a capital? Nope.

25:53.633 --> 25:56.500
That looks like a H.
Fuck.

25:56.567 --> 25:59.667
I'm not being funny,
but Picasso has got nowt on me.

25:59.733 --> 26:02.533
How the fuck do you know
who Picasso is?

26:02.600 --> 26:06.200
This bitch knows who Picasso is,
but she can't spell her own
name?

26:07.133 --> 26:08.233
I'm shocketh.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.067
That's a very good job.
How are we that clever?

26:11.133 --> 26:13.633
My mam would be proud.
Picasso would be proud.

26:13.700 --> 26:16.900
We need to put all this stuff up
before Aaron arrives.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.867
Voila! It's Aaron,
but we're not sure how to spell
it.

26:21.933 --> 26:23.233
(laughs)

26:23.300 --> 26:26.800
Is it double A? Is it one A?
Is it double R? Is it one R?

26:26.867 --> 26:29.633
Who gives a fuck?
Let's just get all the
variations

26:29.700 --> 26:31.167
added on the balloons.

26:31.233 --> 26:34.067
Wha-hey!

26:34.133 --> 26:35.733
My cock's clean.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.300
Oh, my God!
That's so good.

26:40.367 --> 26:44.533
Everyone has worked so hard
and the house looks amazing.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.233
All we need now is Aaron.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.933
(gasps) Oh, my God.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.033
It's Aaron's car. Quick.
Positions!

26:53.100 --> 26:56.633
We can hear the car pull up,
so everybody quickly into
positions.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.833
We're gonna give him
the best surprise.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.600
Grab, grab, grab.
Girls, girls, quick.

27:01.667 --> 27:03.333
Aah!
Shh!

27:05.700 --> 27:09.100
I am beyond excited.
I just can't wait to see his
face.

27:09.167 --> 27:13.167
I hope he loves what we've done
for
him. Wait till he says
something.

27:13.967 --> 27:16.367
It's been great preparing
for my fight,

27:16.433 --> 27:19.000
but now I'm back,
I can't wait to see my family.

27:19.067 --> 27:21.200
Oi, oi! Oh, what's the
fucking...

27:21.267 --> 27:23.633
I get back to the house and
there's
a banner up

27:23.700 --> 27:25.233
saying "Congratulations",

27:25.300 --> 27:29.500
but there's no-one here. Please
tell
me they're in this fucking
house.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.167
One, two, three.

27:34.233 --> 27:36.067
(all) Surprise!

27:36.133 --> 27:37.600
Boom!

27:37.667 --> 27:39.300
Surprise!

27:40.800 --> 27:43.900
Oh, that look on his face.
Priceless.

27:46.333 --> 27:49.267
The champion has returned!

27:50.533 --> 27:52.033
(cheering)

27:52.100 --> 27:54.033
I'm just so pleased
to have him back.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.533
The last two weeks
has dragged without him.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.200
I fucking shit myself.
You all right?

27:59.267 --> 28:01.733
All the family have gone
to so much effort,

28:01.800 --> 28:04.067
but where the fuck is Scott
and Marty?

28:05.067 --> 28:08.833
Aaron, I wrote this.
"Aaron Chalmers, he's our
champ."

28:08.900 --> 28:10.867
"He gets Marnie Simpson damp."

28:10.933 --> 28:14.500
I'm a poet and I didn't know it.

28:14.567 --> 28:18.100
And I've done this.
It's for you. No more diet!

28:18.167 --> 28:22.000
Tell us what it's got in it.
It's one of your favourite
things.

28:23.833 --> 28:25.400
What's it got in it?

28:26.800 --> 28:27.967
What else?

28:29.000 --> 28:30.400
Rum!

28:32.067 --> 28:33.233
It's a rum cake.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.767
My three favourite things
are in this cake.

28:35.833 --> 28:38.000
Chocolate, rum and a bit of
Marnie.

28:38.067 --> 28:40.833
Let's go get ready,
cos it's a fucking big night.

28:40.900 --> 28:43.233
Even though Scott
and Marty are still AWOL,

28:43.300 --> 28:45.533
I'm just buzzing to have Aaron
back.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.300
Now we can celebrate
our champion tonight.

28:56.633 --> 28:59.200
Everyone is so buzzing
that Aaron's back.

28:59.267 --> 29:01.933
I know tonight is gonna be
a fucking mint one.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.200
But where the fuck is Marty?
It's a shame that he's not here.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.467
I am the contour queen.

29:07.533 --> 29:10.467
The girls are trying to make me
feel better about Scott.

29:10.533 --> 29:13.867
I've got Sophie doing my hair
and Chloe doing my make-up.

29:13.933 --> 29:16.800
These girls really know
how to look after us.

29:16.867 --> 29:19.100
I've shaved my fanny.
Let's have a look.

29:19.167 --> 29:22.867
We're all wanting to spruce up
and look amazing for tonight.

29:22.933 --> 29:25.467
And I want to put in
extra attention for Aaron.

29:25.533 --> 29:27.700
Fuck me, it looks like a mouse.

29:27.767 --> 29:31.367
Marnie's fanny is that smooth,
it looks like a dolphin's beak,

29:31.433 --> 29:35.100
and that can only mean one
thing.
Her and Aaron are having sex.

29:36.567 --> 29:39.033
Does anyone have underwear
that I can borrow?

29:39.100 --> 29:40.967
Someone must have some knickers.

29:41.033 --> 29:44.067
Scotty is still probably
dicking around in Birmingham.

29:44.133 --> 29:47.633
But the girls have made me feel
like a million dollars,

29:47.700 --> 29:50.267
so I'm gonna go out tonight
and turn some heads.

29:50.333 --> 29:52.900
Who needs Scotty fucking T?

29:55.600 --> 29:59.700
You haven't seen these, have
you?
We've now got pet ducks.

29:59.767 --> 30:03.533
I don't know what the crack was,
but guess what their names are?

30:03.600 --> 30:05.833
Squeaky and Skinny.
(both laugh)

30:05.900 --> 30:09.900
Skinny and Squeaky.
Who the fuck has chosen these
ducks?

30:09.967 --> 30:13.533
I'm single now. We haven't been
single together in fucking
years.

30:13.600 --> 30:17.800
We're gonna pull fit girls,
all right? Fit.

30:17.867 --> 30:20.167
I can't believe
me and Gaz are both single.

30:20.233 --> 30:21.900
That literally never happens.

30:21.967 --> 30:24.467
But there's only one girl
that I wanna pull.

30:24.533 --> 30:26.500
Where's your head with Marnie?

30:26.567 --> 30:29.933
Tonight, I'm trying to get
smashed.
But it'll be interesting

30:30.000 --> 30:33.767
to see how it pans out. If she
wants
to have fun with no arguments,

30:33.833 --> 30:35.733
that's fine, but this is Marnie.

30:35.800 --> 30:39.500
We are talking about the most
kick-off girl in the world.

30:39.567 --> 30:42.500
Aaron, whatever happens
with you and Marnie, happens.

30:42.567 --> 30:44.533
I'm buzzing
to have my best mate back.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.833
It's your first night back.
Let's get smashed.

30:47.900 --> 30:49.333
Let's go.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.433
Come on, Aaron.
Fuck off.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.433
All he girls on the Toon!
All the lasses!

30:56.267 --> 31:00.467
I cannot believe that Scott and
Marty still haven't turned up.

31:00.533 --> 31:02.633
But that means more drinks for
us.

31:02.700 --> 31:05.300
Aaron's night,
let's get fucking smashed.

31:05.367 --> 31:08.933
I'm well looking forward to
celebrating my win with the
family.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.833
Marnie looks pleased to see us.
Now the fight's over,

31:11.900 --> 31:14.100
it's time to concentrate
on me and her.

31:14.167 --> 31:16.867
(Chloe)
Tonight is gonna be a good one.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.467
I know tonight
is gonna be a good one.

31:23.200 --> 31:27.300
Of course it's functional and
it's
got your name written all over
it.

31:29.567 --> 31:31.100
I was not expecting that.

31:31.167 --> 31:34.467
Everyone! Hot tub!
We're all just so happy.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.967
I don't know whether to watch,
to scream...

31:39.333 --> 31:41.900
I've ended up getting with
Marnie.
I'm buzzing.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.800
(all) Geordie Shore! Wey-aye!

31:48.967 --> 31:49.167
.

31:51.667 --> 31:51.867
.

32:01.433 --> 32:03.667
We arrive at the club
and it's bouncing.

32:03.733 --> 32:06.367
I know tonight
is gonna be a good one.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.167
(they cheer)

32:28.800 --> 32:31.833
Me and Chloe are having a chat
about Scott and Marty.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.867
And we both agree it's weird
them not being here.

32:34.933 --> 32:36.367
What has happened to them?

32:43.167 --> 32:45.500
It is a bit strange
that Marty isn't here,

32:45.567 --> 32:49.800
and I have missed him a lot, cos
me
and him lately have got so
close.

33:08.033 --> 33:10.600
Marnie looks absolutely stunning
tonight.

33:10.667 --> 33:13.533
If she's gonna shag him,
tonight would be the night.

33:22.400 --> 33:27.367
Her being shy around Aaron means
she obviously has feelings for
him.

33:27.433 --> 33:31.233
Something's gonna happen between
them and I hope that it's
marriage.

33:42.500 --> 33:46.433
After Abbie's seen Scott pull,
I feel like her confidence is
down.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.433
But I wanna get it up here

33:48.500 --> 33:51.533
and make her feel
like a fully fledged family
member.

33:59.267 --> 34:01.533
Gary is being really sweet
and telling me

34:01.600 --> 34:04.000
that the girls did a good job
of my makeover.

34:04.067 --> 34:06.833
Well, you don't look so bad
yourself, Gary.

34:18.433 --> 34:21.600
I'm chatting with Aaron and
it feels so good to have him
back.

34:21.667 --> 34:23.467
I'm never gonna let him go
again.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.400
It's nice to see
how much Marnie cares.

34:36.467 --> 34:38.833
It's been so long
since we've been single.

34:38.900 --> 34:41.632
I'm starting to think something
might happen.

34:50.467 --> 34:52.300
Marns, of course it's
functional,

34:52.367 --> 34:55.433
and it's got your name
written all over it. Not
literally,

34:55.500 --> 34:57.200
but you know what I mean.

34:59.767 --> 35:01.967
(Gaz) Cheers, everyone!

35:08.567 --> 35:12.000
You know we're having a good
night
if Gaz's dancing comes out.

35:28.067 --> 35:30.100
I see Aaron and Marnie
about to kiss,

35:30.167 --> 35:33.033
but Aaron's looking at me,
back to Marnie,

35:33.100 --> 35:35.633
looking at me. OK, go on.

35:38.767 --> 35:41.100
(cheering)

35:43.033 --> 35:45.433
Whoa!

35:49.700 --> 35:52.600
Yes! Me and Aaron
are finally tashing on,

35:52.667 --> 35:56.667
and it's better than I can
ever remember. What a fucking
buzz.

36:00.767 --> 36:04.100
Tonight, I am fucking mortal.

36:04.167 --> 36:06.633
My fanny's out, my tit's out.

36:06.700 --> 36:08.300
I'm swinging me hair around.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.667
I think I'm fucking Beyonce.

36:14.833 --> 36:17.700
This is my first night out
since I won my fight.

36:17.767 --> 36:20.200
If this is a sign of things to
come,
bring it on.

36:31.533 --> 36:35.667
Nathan's just ran over to try
and
three-way kiss with me and
Marnie.

36:35.733 --> 36:38.533
No, Nathan,
Marnie is all mine tonight.

36:40.367 --> 36:44.167
I might be a little bit drunk
and
there is a lot of love in the
air,

36:44.233 --> 36:47.267
but Marnie will always be my
Marns.

36:53.100 --> 36:56.800
Everyone's getting with
everyone.
I'm single. Abbie's looking fit.

36:56.867 --> 36:59.133
Fuck it. I've decided to crack
on.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.233
This makeover is really
working a treat.

37:10.300 --> 37:11.867
Cos I was not expecting that.

37:22.267 --> 37:25.533
Gary, you may have shagged
the whole of Newcastle,

37:25.600 --> 37:29.600
but if you wanna get with me,
you've
got to try a lot harder than
that.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.467
God loves a tryer.

37:33.533 --> 37:36.233
I'm up for the challenge
when it comes to Abbie.

37:43.267 --> 37:45.467
This is how nights out
should be like.

37:45.533 --> 37:47.733
It's just us,
pissed out of our heads,

37:47.800 --> 37:51.833
enjoying each other's company.
Now it's time to head home.

37:57.300 --> 38:01.333
I can't wait to get Marns home
and
get her in that fucking shag
pad.

38:04.067 --> 38:06.800
Sometimes we get back and argue,
have a food fight,

38:06.867 --> 38:10.400
but we all haven't been in a
good
mood and in that hot tub for
ages,

38:10.467 --> 38:13.700
so first, I'm gonna get Sophie
and throw her in.

38:16.100 --> 38:19.700
# Sophie's in the hot tub
La-la, la-la

38:19.767 --> 38:21.567
# La-la-la

38:21.633 --> 38:26.000
I'm in the hot tub topless.
What has got into me tonight?

38:26.067 --> 38:27.700
It's definitely the vodka.

38:27.767 --> 38:29.800
Everyone, hot tub!

38:33.800 --> 38:37.200
Gary put Sophie in the hot tub,
but I get put in the bird bath.

38:37.267 --> 38:38.467
I am not an animal!

38:39.633 --> 38:41.333
Chloe, just get out.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.567
Thank fuck that them ducks
are asleep,

38:45.633 --> 38:49.133
because I don't want them
seeing their mam in this state.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.533
Sophie, come on!

38:50.600 --> 38:52.967
We're all naked,
we're all in the hot tub.

38:53.033 --> 38:56.067
We're all just so happy. I love
it.

38:57.233 --> 39:00.167
It's like a hot tub of Geordie
soup.

39:00.233 --> 39:02.733
It's nights like tonight
that remind us

39:02.800 --> 39:04.900
how special our family really
is.

39:05.733 --> 39:09.933
Marnie suggests we play
truth or dare, my favourite
game.

39:12.500 --> 39:15.300
Abbie, come here. (laughs)

39:15.367 --> 39:19.467
I can't turn down a dare,
so I have a little peck.

39:20.667 --> 39:21.900
That was shit!

39:21.967 --> 39:24.833
Why am I playing truth or dare
with amateurs?

39:24.900 --> 39:27.600
You better step it up
if you want me to play.

39:35.667 --> 39:38.367
He didn't even think.
He was taking it seriously.

39:38.433 --> 39:42.200
The kid was like Usain Bolt.
He couldn't wait to get in
there.

39:43.533 --> 39:46.900
Gary doesn't have to ask us
twice,
cos I'm already in the shag pad

39:46.967 --> 39:48.667
with my legs wide open.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.100
Oh, my God!

39:52.167 --> 39:56.033
I don't now whether to watch,
to scream, to hide.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.267
I think
I'm really enjoying watching.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.233
After what Nathan did,
I feel like I've got power.

40:08.300 --> 40:11.100
I haven't seen Sophie let loose
in ages.

40:11.167 --> 40:12.400
I fucking love it!

40:12.467 --> 40:14.933
(all chant) Sophie! Sophie!
Sophie!

40:15.000 --> 40:16.433
(Nathan) Go on, Sophie!

40:17.533 --> 40:19.367
Yay!

40:19.433 --> 40:22.200
I'm simulating sex, mortal,
naked.

40:22.267 --> 40:24.300
Don't even know my own fucking
name.

40:24.367 --> 40:26.767
This is the best night ever.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.000
Wow. Wow.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.833
It wouldn't be a Geordie Shore
night out, without a food fight.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.433
But this time,
it's a naked food fight.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.433
This is gonna get messy.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.300
This is getting a bit weird.

40:53.367 --> 40:56.633
I won't let anything stop me
and Aaron's night back together.

40:56.700 --> 41:00.000
I'm gonna take him to bed
and get away from this mess.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.200
(indistinct shouting)

41:07.167 --> 41:09.433
(Nathan laughs)

41:12.400 --> 41:15.367
I am covered in food.
I need to go in the shower.

41:15.433 --> 41:17.700
But I feel like everyone
wants to join us.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.500
Why are they such pervs?

41:21.300 --> 41:25.000
Do you know what it is? Let's
just
continue the love. Shower,
anyone?

41:27.267 --> 41:30.433
I walk into the bathroom and see
everyone else in the shower.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.267
I'm gonna join in.
This is one fucked-up family.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.933
This shower is so wrong.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.500
Yet it feels so right.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.833
This has been one of the best
nights
in the Geordie Shore house.

41:46.900 --> 41:49.900
I'm just gutted that Scott and
Marty
missed it.

41:49.967 --> 41:52.367
The amount of times
I fell over tonight,

41:52.433 --> 41:55.600
I need to go to bed
before I hurt myself even more.

42:06.567 --> 42:09.000
Tonight couldn't really get any
better.

42:09.067 --> 42:11.800
We've had a wicked night out,
all been in the hot tub,

42:11.867 --> 42:14.367
and now me and Marnie
are in the shag pad.

42:19.067 --> 42:21.367
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

42:21.433 --> 42:23.933
Me and Aaron
are actually having sex again.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.133
It's been so long since we did
this.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.000
But it feels so right.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.067
I come back to the house to have
fun
and enjoy myself,

42:33.133 --> 42:35.267
and I've ended up
getting with Marnie.

42:35.333 --> 42:39.267
I'm buzzing, and who knows, we
might
give this relationship another
go.

42:39.333 --> 42:41.333
Wow. I'm done.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.633
Everyone, Anna's here.

42:47.700 --> 42:50.967
I've got some good news...
and some bad news.

42:51.033 --> 42:52.533
What the fuck can it be?

42:52.600 --> 42:55.100
I am sending you... to Rome.

42:55.167 --> 42:56.433
(all cheer)

42:56.500 --> 42:58.567
I can't fucking wait.

42:58.633 --> 43:00.333
Hello, Italy!

43:00.400 --> 43:03.033
I just hope that Rome
is ready for we.

43:05.733 --> 43:08.667
It makes it even better
that it's because of me.

43:08.733 --> 43:11.967
Abbie is looking pretty fit.

43:12.033 --> 43:13.200
(shouting)

43:13.267 --> 43:16.533
Who wants to come to Newcastle?
You look like a giant turd.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.933
Oh, my God! Hi.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.467
I'm back!

43:20.533 --> 43:22.900
What the fuck happened to Abbie,
Gary?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.967
It's time to put all this graft
to work.

43:54.833 --> 43:55.033
.
