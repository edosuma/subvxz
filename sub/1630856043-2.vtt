WEBVTT

00:04.424 --> 00:07.468
Tell a bad bitch to tell another bad bitch
to meet us there.

00:07.468 --> 00:08.595
- Mwah.
- See ya.

00:10.180 --> 00:12.807
I heard a lot of y'all motherfuckers
still taking Ubers to y'all shows

00:12.807 --> 00:14.601
coming to y'all's shows in fucking Jettas.

00:14.601 --> 00:16.686
We ain't on that shit.
You see what the fuck we on.

00:16.686 --> 00:18.313
Y'all, look at y'all new home!

00:18.313 --> 00:20.106
So this is where it all goes down.

00:20.106 --> 00:22.317
- It goes down!
- And then it goes down.

00:22.942 --> 00:25.403
Okay, bitch! Kiss my ass, please!

00:27.822 --> 00:29.199
Do y'all got your own bus driver?

00:29.199 --> 00:31.367
- Ooh!
- Ay!

00:31.367 --> 00:34.329
It's the Duke of Miami.
We outside on the bus.

00:34.329 --> 00:35.830
Big bus vibe!

00:37.248 --> 00:39.000
We got a fridge
bigger than y'all apartments!

00:39.000 --> 00:40.251
Y'all broke ass.

00:40.251 --> 00:41.836
And we have Bella Reina Reign.

00:41.836 --> 00:43.296
Yes, that's my bitch.

00:43.296 --> 00:45.757
Yeah, it's about to rain on you hoes'
motherfucking parade, bitch!

00:47.592 --> 00:49.636
Hey, from the shuttle bus to the tour bus.

01:10.740 --> 01:12.575
It's our first tour stop,
they couldn't even be bothered

01:12.575 --> 01:14.077
to put our names on the marquee?

01:14.077 --> 01:16.371
It's like nine letters and a ampersand.

01:16.371 --> 01:18.456
Well, you get what you negotiate for.

01:18.456 --> 01:19.916
But what do I know?

01:21.376 --> 01:22.669
Well, I'm ready.

01:23.419 --> 01:24.587
This is fucked up.

01:24.587 --> 01:26.172
Whatever, at least we get to meet Lord AK.

01:26.172 --> 01:29.133
Yep, I'm working on it.
Y'all just kill it on stage.

01:32.470 --> 01:34.973
Hello, everyone. Look at my dressing room.

01:34.973 --> 01:36.015
You see we in here.

01:36.015 --> 01:38.059
We about to open up for Lord AK.

01:43.064 --> 01:44.023
Thank you.

01:45.483 --> 01:47.110
No, we haven't met Lord AK yet,

01:47.110 --> 01:49.154
but I have a plan
and we're gonna see him.

01:49.154 --> 01:50.321
He's gonna fall in love with me.

01:50.321 --> 01:51.739
Or us. He's gonna fall in love with us.

01:52.365 --> 01:55.535
No, no,
the apron is a costuming choice.

01:55.952 --> 01:58.663
We're all wearing them.
It's part of our aesthetic.

01:58.663 --> 01:59.831
And you know what?

01:59.831 --> 02:01.082
How 'bout just wait? Tune in.

02:01.082 --> 02:03.168
Wait till we come to your city,
you gon' find out.

02:06.671 --> 02:09.549
Damn. Okay.
Y'all coming for my whole shit.

02:09.966 --> 02:12.594
Well...

02:12.594 --> 02:15.471
Okay, first of all, I am an artist,

02:15.471 --> 02:17.515
and that means changes.

02:17.515 --> 02:21.060
And how I express that... changes.

02:21.519 --> 02:24.105
Okay? I make music
that makes people feel good

02:24.731 --> 02:27.442
and I'm really proud of how far I've come.

02:28.193 --> 02:30.570
I'm on a tour with my peers,

02:30.570 --> 02:32.071
like my peers.

02:32.780 --> 02:37.327
And I respect
all of the artists on this tour.

02:40.413 --> 02:42.040
Me and Mia don't hate each other.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.584
We are good. Mia is somewhere.

02:44.584 --> 02:46.419
She's practicing. I see her right now.

02:46.419 --> 02:47.712
She's over there dancing.

02:48.671 --> 02:50.298
And we're just getting ready.

02:50.298 --> 02:53.051
We're super excited about

02:54.010 --> 02:56.137
blowing the top off Portland, Oregon.

02:58.765 --> 03:00.600
<i>This to Mr. Underground,
Country Grammar</i>

03:00.600 --> 03:02.060
<i>Came through with a bunch of manners</i>

03:02.060 --> 03:03.895
<i>Write that off for seventy
and west flows</i>

03:03.895 --> 03:05.313
<i>And more than just a bunch of banter</i>

03:05.313 --> 03:07.106
<i>Bantu knots and a .38</i>

03:07.106 --> 03:08.233
<i>Make the world revolve around you</i>

03:08.233 --> 03:09.859
- Y'all okay?
- Mm-hmm.

03:10.819 --> 03:12.821
Good, 'cause I just walked
past Reina dressing room,

03:12.821 --> 03:14.531
and she had on a custom leotard.

03:15.907 --> 03:18.034
Wait, so she don't got on her apron?

03:18.034 --> 03:20.495
I ain't see no apron. I seen Gucci.

03:20.495 --> 03:22.747
Wait, so she got on Gucci,
and we got on...

03:23.623 --> 03:24.707
IHOP?

03:25.875 --> 03:27.752
This is officially racist.

03:27.752 --> 03:29.003
This whole shit is racist.

03:29.003 --> 03:30.296
Now, can I go say something?

03:30.296 --> 03:31.589
Please, yeah.

03:32.340 --> 03:33.716
We look like her help.

03:45.395 --> 03:46.688
Is Francois here?

03:48.606 --> 03:49.941
Hey, Francois.

03:53.570 --> 03:55.155
What up? What up?
Can I holla at you for a minute?

03:55.155 --> 03:57.365
- What's up?
- Yeah, so the girls,

03:57.365 --> 03:58.867
they don't wanna wear
them aprons on stage.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.286
Oh, my God. Why?

04:01.286 --> 04:05.081
Black women don't really feel sexy
when they got to dress like Aunt Jemima.

04:06.624 --> 04:08.042
Shawna sent you.

04:08.042 --> 04:11.921
Okay, tell Shawna
y'all are here to assist Reina's set.

04:11.921 --> 04:14.174
No, we're here to elevate Reina's set.

04:14.174 --> 04:16.301
Okay, sure. Whatever you gotta tell 'em.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.261
Man. Come on. Look, my thing is--

04:18.261 --> 04:20.013
Oh, my God. Are we still talking?

04:21.389 --> 04:23.308
I'm just trying to figure out
what you're here for

04:23.308 --> 04:26.227
but clearly you're as confused as I am.

04:33.943 --> 04:35.570
<i>Ayy, V, light 'em up</i>

04:35.570 --> 04:38.781
<i>Skinny jeans, white tee,
G Nikes, Glock</i>

04:38.781 --> 04:41.784
<i>Wanna meet Jesus? Be my opp</i>

04:41.784 --> 04:44.704
<i>She don't speak English,
she speak gawk</i>

04:44.704 --> 04:47.999
<i>Said she wasn't hungry,
still ate my cock</i>

04:47.999 --> 04:49.083
Hey.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.921
Yo. Sorry, I forgot that she
was getting out early today.

04:52.921 --> 04:54.172
How you doing, bro?

05:02.972 --> 05:04.098
You good?

05:06.851 --> 05:09.103
Think I'm gonna go back there now.
You ready?

05:09.103 --> 05:10.772
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get to it.

05:12.148 --> 05:13.233
Could you load this up for me?

05:13.233 --> 05:14.359
Got you. Alright.

05:15.109 --> 05:16.611
Can I have a snack?

05:17.946 --> 05:19.364
What, baby, they ain't feed you at school?

05:19.364 --> 05:22.659
We didn't have lunch today
because we left early.

05:22.659 --> 05:25.453
Right. Damn.
I'll just order you some nuggets.

05:25.787 --> 05:28.081
- How long will it take?
- I don't know, baby.

05:28.081 --> 05:29.958
Probably like 40 minutes.

05:29.958 --> 05:33.127
Forty minutes? Come on. Now!

05:33.127 --> 05:35.129
- Oh, okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Come on!

05:35.129 --> 05:37.090
Hey, listen, I got you, alright?

05:37.090 --> 05:38.424
Just give me a minute, alright?

05:40.885 --> 05:41.928
Melissa.

05:41.928 --> 05:44.305
You never feed me on time.

05:44.305 --> 05:46.099
I'm always hungry when I'm with you.

05:46.099 --> 05:47.809
Mom never does this to me.

05:47.809 --> 05:50.478
Melissa, hey,
do not make me start counting.

05:50.478 --> 05:52.522
Nuggets, nuggets, nuggets...

05:52.522 --> 05:53.648
- One...
- ...nuggets, nuggets!

05:53.648 --> 05:55.859
- ...two, three...
- Nuggets!

05:55.859 --> 05:57.193
Four, five, six!

05:59.612 --> 06:00.989
I can go to Wendy's.

06:01.823 --> 06:04.159
That would be good.
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

06:19.924 --> 06:21.509
Code Pink!

06:25.972 --> 06:27.140
Break it down.

06:29.392 --> 06:31.352
Oh, no, motherfucker, not today!

06:32.520 --> 06:33.646
Assume the position.

06:34.564 --> 06:36.107
<i>Yo, I know you heard about this pussy</i>

08:55.121 --> 08:56.789
We looked crazy out there.

08:56.789 --> 08:58.541
Girl, what's the problem now?

08:58.541 --> 09:00.585
The problem is
we didn't look like a group.

09:00.585 --> 09:02.045
You think that was group activities?

09:02.045 --> 09:04.631
Oh, now you see how it feels.

09:05.048 --> 09:06.716
Okay, cool, that was payback.

09:06.716 --> 09:08.301
Okay, fine. You got it out. Whatever.

09:08.301 --> 09:11.262
But just please, from now on,
we have to look like a group.

09:11.262 --> 09:13.223
Sound like to me you need to step it up.

09:13.223 --> 09:14.933
I left my baby to be here.

09:14.933 --> 09:17.185
So every night, I'ma bring it.

09:17.185 --> 09:18.645
Okay, clearly you're not listening,

09:18.645 --> 09:20.396
so do whatever the fuck you wanna do, Mia.

09:20.396 --> 09:22.816
Okay. Ain't nobody come

09:25.151 --> 09:27.403
<i>The plot thick but this bitch thicker</i>

09:27.779 --> 09:30.824
<i>The lifestyles of a real nigga, yeah</i>

<i>Growin' up, I never had a limit</i>

09:34.118 --> 09:36.788
<i>They let me down bad,

09:38.206 --> 09:39.958
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

09:39.958 --> 09:42.877
<i>They let me down bad,

09:43.545 --> 09:47.048
Yeah. Hey, look,
that shit was fire, alright?

09:47.048 --> 09:49.759
That was fire.
On this one, let's do something different.

09:49.759 --> 09:53.012
Let's be more animated.
You feel me?

09:53.012 --> 09:55.223
On your voice.
Like, be on your Kendrick shit.

09:55.223 --> 09:56.891
Let's try it. I could do that for you.
Let's do it.

09:56.891 --> 09:59.644
Alright, bet. Let me get you right here.

10:02.522 --> 10:05.150
- Yeah, baby?
- Daddy, can we go now?

10:05.150 --> 10:06.985
just give me a second, okay?

10:06.985 --> 10:08.903

11:37.826 --> 11:39.828
<i>Yes. Yeah, of course, I did.</i>

11:41.204 --> 11:42.413
How was your first show?

11:42.956 --> 11:45.625
I honestly don't even remember.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.669
I just know people were screaming.

11:47.669 --> 11:48.878
It felt like I was high

11:48.878 --> 11:50.630
and I don't even know who I was up there

11:50.630 --> 11:52.215

Knees hurt. Loss of memory.

12:01.057 --> 12:02.475
<i>Miyaki.</i>

12:02.475 --> 12:04.769

I ain't seen her in a minute.

12:04.769 --> 12:07.272
Me either, but I ain't forget about her.

12:07.689 --> 12:09.023
Anyway.

12:09.023 --> 12:11.067
So, how'd the session go?

12:11.067 --> 12:14.654
Man, I had to take Lissa with me

Nah, the group. Lord AK is a big fan.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.848
Man, he personally requested them.

14:05.974 --> 14:07.308
Well, that's none of my business.

14:07.308 --> 14:09.185
But they got all-access badges, so.

14:09.185 --> 14:11.813
- Right.
- They can come on in, but you can't.

14:11.813 --> 14:13.189
You got a staff badge.

14:13.189 --> 14:14.691
What the fuck? What you mean?

14:14.691 --> 14:16.860

Yo, yo! Hey, hey, hey, P,

and let's make this

14:49.392 --> 14:50.560
a night to remember.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.978
What up, Anaconda?

14:51.978 --> 14:54.189
How you feeling?
Ooh, with the roll on it.

Get your ass up in here. Hey!

15:01.070 --> 15:03.781
Okay, this is exactly what I expected.

15:03.781 --> 15:06.409
So are we supposed to
just wait for Lord AK to get here?

15:07.076 --> 15:08.161
I don't know.

15:08.161 --> 15:10.246
Maybe just like network or something.

15:10.246 --> 15:12.707
We just got to get past
all these little groupie hoes.

15:12.707 --> 15:14.959
I'm sure there's somebody here
that knows Lord AK

15:14.959 --> 15:17.212
or is maybe on the tour or something.

15:17.837 --> 15:19.797
Well, the only one I recognize is Gat

15:19.797 --> 15:22.050
and he ain't had a hit
since Kodak got out of jail.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.551
Yeah, yeah, okay.

15:23.551 --> 15:24.886
- Yeah.
- I mean, it doesn't matter.

15:24.886 --> 15:26.721
These niggas are all opportunities.

15:26.721 --> 15:29.265
That's Lord AK's friend, Smacc.
I'ma go talk to him.

15:30.725 --> 15:32.560
Smacc. Hi.

15:33.811 --> 15:35.438
Hey, Smacc. How's your day going?

15:36.856 --> 15:38.525
Every day the day dies.

15:43.071 --> 15:44.072
Okay.

15:45.532 --> 15:47.659
Okay, I see why you're
sitting here by yourself.

15:47.659 --> 15:50.495

We needed you.

18:47.463 --> 18:48.840
And I'm here for y'all.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.884
Lord AK got about three,
four more songs to go.

18:50.884 --> 18:53.595
And then he gonna come back here,

18:55.263 --> 18:57.390
Damn, bitch. Why y'all shoulders rocking?

18:57.390 --> 18:59.309

This a live action vision board.

This is success.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.155
You see that nigga hairline right there?

19:12.155 --> 19:13.781
Straight from Turkey. That's success.

19:13.781 --> 19:15.033
Look at that BBL right there.

19:15.033 --> 19:16.826
Look at the ass-to-thigh ratio.

19:16.826 --> 19:18.703
Goddamn, that's money.

19:18.703 --> 19:19.787
I'm thinking Colombia.

I want to bite it.

19:20.997 --> 19:22.499
Listen, here's my thing.

19:22.499 --> 19:25.335
Anytime you see this many groupies,
there gotta be some money around.

19:25.335 --> 19:26.503
You just got to follow the groupies.

19:26.503 --> 19:29.172
You just got to follow the groupies
like you following a pot of gold

19:29.172 --> 19:30.298
to the end of the rainbow.

19:30.298 --> 19:31.925
You just got to follow, follow, follow.

19:34.594 --> 19:37.597
I got to pee.

19:37.597 --> 19:39.098
I'll be back.

19:39.098 --> 19:40.683
What was up with her?

19:40.683 --> 19:43.311
Whatever she drinking,
I don't want none of that shit.

19:43.811 --> 19:44.854
What the fuck?

19:45.855 --> 19:46.815
Okay.

Alright, alright.
Come on, y'all. We got this.

27:20.435 --> 27:23.104
Look, you gotta watch

27:23.104 --> 27:25.315
You can't keep complaining

27:25.315 --> 27:27.567
Damn.
"This racist. This misogynistic."

27:27.567 --> 27:29.986
You're around a bunch
of rap niggas, Shawna.

27:30.862 --> 27:33.281
You could keep acting like
you all special and above niggas,

27:33.281 --> 27:34.824
or you could play a role

27:34.824 --> 27:36.743
and keep it pushin' like everybody else.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.252
Sorry your hair got messed up.

28:49.232 --> 28:52.902
<i>You're right behind</i>

28:53.862 --> 28:57.198
<i>Am I thinking it out loud?</i>

29:00.034 --> 29:01.494
<i>All by myself</i>

29:01.494 --> 29:04.205
<i>I never know if I'm good</i>

29:05.039 --> 29:06.166
<i>I wait</i>

29:06.166 --> 29:07.292
<i>For moments</i>

29:07.292 --> 29:08.418
<i>Debate</i>

29:08.418 --> 29:09.502
<i>And minutes</i>

29:09.502 --> 29:10.670
<i>And refrain</i>

29:10.670 --> 29:11.963
<i>And hours</i>

29:11.963 --> 29:15.175
<i>Let you say the words you say</i>

29:17.760 --> 29:19.637
<i>'Til I break away</i>

29:19.637 --> 29:22.015
<i>Until the day</i>

29:22.849 --> 29:24.058
<i>You're like the blue</i>

29:24.058 --> 29:26.394
<i>I feel alive inside it</i>

29:26.394 --> 29:28.480
<i>Feel like driving somewhere</i>

29:28.480 --> 29:30.190
<i>Someplace</i>

29:31.816 --> 29:32.901
<i>And the green</i>

29:32.901 --> 29:35.195
<i>I wanna run to my fears</i>

29:35.195 --> 29:37.530
<i>'Til I'm not afraid</i>

29:37.530 --> 29:41.117
<i>And the turquoise in my mind</i>

29:41.117 --> 29:42.410
<i>My heart</i>

29:43.161 --> 29:44.787
<i>Can confide</i>

29:45.413 --> 29:47.081
<i>In itself</i>

29:47.874 --> 29:51.544
<i>No, I don't need no one else</i>

29:51.544 --> 29:53.796
<i>You can't tell me nothing</i>

29:53.796 --> 29:55.590
<i>To show me the way</i>

29:55.590 --> 29:58.259
<i>Like a jaguar in the wild</i>

29:59.177 --> 30:00.261
<i>I wait...</i>
