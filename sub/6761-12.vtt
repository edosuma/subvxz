<i>Why don't you come over
and see me soon</i>

02:06.332 --> 02:09.334
<i>And we can have so much fun</i>

02:09.418 --> 02:12.921
<i>Two times good
And two times bad</i>

02:14.132 --> 02:15.466
<i>Two times good</i>

02:15.549 --> 02:20.263
Is this a public performance
or should I pretend I'm not listening?

02:20.971 --> 02:24.684
Sorry, I thought I was alone.

02:24.767 --> 02:27.186
- I know. So did I.
- I can leave.

02:27.686 --> 02:30.982
No, no, no, don't. I hate to eat alone.

02:31.899 --> 02:34.193
- All right.
- I'm Brandon.

02:34.986 --> 02:36.570
Hi, I'm Melissa.

02:36.653 --> 02:38.363
- Hi, Melissa.
- Hi.

02:39.365 --> 02:42.159
So are you brilliant or just a dreamer?

02:42.534 --> 02:46.121
- Actually, I'm a brilliant dreamer.
- I see.

02:47.415 --> 02:50.709
Oh, Harvard. So what do you think
your chances are?

02:51.752 --> 02:53.087
For real.

02:53.212 --> 02:54.796
Well, I have an interview this weekend.

02:54.839 --> 02:58.216
And if all goes well,
I think my chances are pretty good.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.677
- I'm impressed.
- You should be.

03:01.178 --> 03:03.514
Just don't expect a vocal scholarship.

03:05.766 --> 03:10.145
- Where are you applying?
- Nowhere, until next year.

03:10.271 --> 03:12.898
- Are you a junior?
- Yeah.

03:14.065 --> 03:16.568
Don't worry. I won't hold it against you.

03:21.949 --> 03:26.620
God, I'd love to skip class,
just hang out here all afternoon.

03:28.705 --> 03:31.458
- Sounds like a plan to me.
- Yeah, right.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.002
In my dreams.

03:35.045 --> 03:38.007
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you, too.

03:38.090 --> 03:40.926
- Enjoy the 11th grade.
- Thanks.

03:44.888 --> 03:47.391
Oh, hey, wait a minute,
you forgot something!

03:57.150 --> 03:58.318
"A+.

03:59.527 --> 04:03.115
"Caesar could have used
more speechwriters like you."

04:17.295 --> 04:19.423
Melissa Coolidge.

04:34.604 --> 04:36.147
<i>Big Toy by Confusion.</i>

04:36.231 --> 04:37.858
That's it. We've got all five.

04:37.899 --> 04:39.735
Oh, my God. Start dialing.

04:40.193 --> 04:42.487
<i>Five in a row. Five in a row,</i>

04:42.571 --> 04:45.199
<i>on KSRN 105.4!</i>

04:45.240 --> 04:47.326
<i>We'll be taking caller number seven.</i>

04:47.826 --> 04:50.746
<i>Because nothing compares
to winning on KSRN 105.4!</i>

04:50.829 --> 04:51.997
Hello?

04:52.081 --> 04:53.915
- Hello?
- You got through?

04:54.249 --> 04:57.335
- Brenda?
- Brandon! Get off the phone!

04:58.711 --> 05:02.466
Brenda, you can't keep tying up
the phone lines every afternoon.

05:02.549 --> 05:05.218
Why? Who are you
so desperate to call, anyway?

05:06.428 --> 05:07.596
Just a girl.

05:07.679 --> 05:09.681
- A girl?
- Hey! Wait a second.

05:09.764 --> 05:12.685
- You didn't say this was a date call.
- It's not.

05:13.060 --> 05:15.812
I met her at lunch,
she dropped her Latin paper.

05:16.062 --> 05:18.523
Who would wanna date a girl
who takes Latin?

05:18.649 --> 05:20.859
A bizarre concept, I realize.

05:20.943 --> 05:23.153
- So is love, come on.
- Brenda.

05:23.278 --> 05:25.405
Hey, you made me call guys before.

05:25.489 --> 05:27.032
What's her number?

05:27.157 --> 05:28.700
I don't even know what to say.

05:28.784 --> 05:30.618
<i>Try E pluribus unum.</i>

05:31.494 --> 05:34.456
- Where did you learn that?
- It's on money.

05:34.622 --> 05:35.874
Number please?

05:36.041 --> 05:38.293
555-4459.

05:38.418 --> 05:41.463
Okay, in this case, I think
you should use the surprise approach.

05:41.588 --> 05:43.131
Don't give her any small talk. Just ask.

05:43.214 --> 05:45.675
That way, she doesn't have time
to think about it.

05:45.759 --> 05:47.427
Yeah, but don't sound too cocky.

05:47.469 --> 05:50.972
- Why? A little bit of cocky is good.
- Cocky guys are jerks.

05:51.055 --> 05:53.392
- Just be confident.
- Be sweet.

05:53.475 --> 05:54.851
- But cool.
- But nice.

05:54.935 --> 05:56.144
But don't take no for an answer.

05:56.228 --> 05:58.522
Unless she says she's baby-sitting.

05:58.855 --> 06:00.356
Oldest excuse in the book.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.359
Hi, is Melissa there?

06:04.694 --> 06:06.654
- Hello?
- She's coming.

06:06.904 --> 06:09.574
Hi, Melissa? It's Brandon.

06:12.119 --> 06:14.495
Brandon. I met you under the tree
at lunch today.

06:14.579 --> 06:18.041
Cut the small talk.
You're giving her too much time to think.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.086
Look, I'm really calling you
for two reasons.

06:21.711 --> 06:24.797
Number one:
I have the Latin paper you left behind.

06:25.090 --> 06:28.635
And... No, no, don't worry.
I didn't understand a word of it.

06:29.261 --> 06:30.345
Number two:

06:30.470 --> 06:34.057
I... I wanted to know
if you're free for dinner on Friday night.

06:35.225 --> 06:37.018
Baby-sitting, huh?

06:38.437 --> 06:40.814
Well, how about Saturday night?

06:42.482 --> 06:44.317
Baby-sitting again.

06:44.651 --> 06:47.237
Hang up before you humiliate yourself
any further.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.447
Nobody baby-sits that much.

06:49.531 --> 06:52.659
Come on, Melissa,
nobody baby-sits that much.

06:52.743 --> 06:56.287
If you don't want to go out with me,
why don't you just say so?

06:56.955 --> 06:58.874
Really, you think you could?

06:59.582 --> 07:01.585
Yeah, that... That'd be great.

07:02.043 --> 07:05.213
Yeah, your...
Your address is in the student directory.

07:06.131 --> 07:09.551
Okay, how about 8:00?

07:10.886 --> 07:12.095
Great.

07:14.847 --> 07:18.810
- She said she'd find a replacement.
- You totally busted her.

07:19.728 --> 07:21.646
My brother, the stud.

07:22.647 --> 07:25.566
I don't know, guys.
Maybe she really did have to baby-sit.

07:25.692 --> 07:28.111
- Brandon...
- That makes no sense.

07:28.236 --> 07:32.573
Yeah, well, neither do the two of you.

07:59.392 --> 08:00.852
- Brandon?
- Hi.

08:00.977 --> 08:03.855
- Come on in. Melissa will be right down.
- Great. Thanks.

08:04.356 --> 08:05.815
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:07.275 --> 08:09.194
- You sure this is okay, Mom?
- Absolutely.

08:09.276 --> 08:11.696
- Go out and have a good time.
- Thanks.

08:12.030 --> 08:13.864
We won't be out late. I promise.

08:13.948 --> 08:15.617
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:22.623 --> 08:26.586
Sorry, I didn't mean to come off
like a senior snob when I met you.

08:26.669 --> 08:27.879
You did.

08:28.212 --> 08:31.091
- So why'd you call me?
- I don't know.

08:31.174 --> 08:35.595
I thought if I got real lucky, you know,
you might sing for me again.

08:37.722 --> 08:40.099
You really don't know
anything about me?

08:40.933 --> 08:43.186
- You never heard anything?
- Nope.

08:43.311 --> 08:45.647
First time I ever saw you
was three days ago,

08:45.730 --> 08:48.357
- sitting under my favorite tree.
- My favorite tree.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.359
My favorite tree.

08:50.944 --> 08:54.072
- God, this is so weird.
- What?

08:55.823 --> 08:58.576
There's a lot about me
you don't know, Brandon.

08:58.742 --> 09:00.203
Shock me.

09:02.121 --> 09:03.581
Maybe later.

09:11.130 --> 09:13.174
<i>It's Lost Her Love by Trinidad.</i>

09:13.257 --> 09:15.218
- Are you sure?
- Brenda, I lived this song.

09:15.301 --> 09:17.345
- Start dialing.
- Write it down.

09:27.105 --> 09:28.147
Who are you calling?

09:28.231 --> 09:31.317
I told a client I'd check in with him
before he left for vacation tomorrow.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.318
<i>Dad! Get off the phone!</i>

09:34.153 --> 09:35.905
Am I going to have to put in
a second line?

09:35.946 --> 09:38.199
Oh, Jim, they'll be going away to college
soon enough,

09:38.324 --> 09:39.867
you'll wish the phone was so busy.

09:39.950 --> 09:42.578
It will be, only we'll be calling them.

09:43.204 --> 09:46.582
<i>Caller number five, sorry.
Later, caller number six.</i>

09:46.665 --> 09:49.085
<i>Hello, caller number seven.
Your name please.</i>

09:49.168 --> 09:51.129
<i>Brenda. Brenda Walsh.</i>

09:51.754 --> 09:53.006
No way!

09:53.256 --> 09:55.341
- What?
- That's my sister!

09:59.845 --> 10:01.806
<i>Can't Touch This by MC Hammer.</i>

10:01.889 --> 10:03.892
<i>Right. Only one more to go.</i>

10:03.933 --> 10:05.726
<i>And Lost Her Love by Trinidad.</i>

10:05.810 --> 10:08.020
<i>Five in a row, five in a row.</i>

10:08.104 --> 10:09.897
I don't believe it.

10:13.359 --> 10:14.443
- We won?
- No.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.903
Yes, we won!

10:15.987 --> 10:17.447
We won. We won! We won!

10:18.697 --> 10:19.698
We won! We won!

10:19.782 --> 10:21.659
What is going on up there?

10:22.951 --> 10:24.119
<i>Okay, Brenda,</i>

10:24.203 --> 10:27.206
<i>let's check out the Hit Machine
and see what you've won.</i>

10:27.248 --> 10:29.333
<i>Skydiving lessons for two.</i>

10:29.416 --> 10:32.461
<i>- How does that hit you, Brenda?
- Great.</i>

10:32.545 --> 10:34.046
Skydiving?

10:34.130 --> 10:37.550
Oh, no. Brenda is scared to death
of heights.

10:46.476 --> 10:50.688
- Next time I'll let you choose the movie.
- No, tonight was really great.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.115
You know, I...

11:01.199 --> 11:04.159
I feel like I'm deceiving you
or something.

11:04.619 --> 11:06.913
I mean, I thought
everyone at school knew.

11:06.996 --> 11:08.205
Knew what?

11:09.915 --> 11:11.667
Why don't you come inside?

11:16.922 --> 11:19.466
There's someone I want you to meet.

11:22.719 --> 11:24.596
Brandon, this is Joey.

11:24.889 --> 11:26.223
Little brother.

11:26.556 --> 11:28.350
Hi, Joey. Hi.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.562
I don't get it, what's the big deal?

11:31.645 --> 11:33.564
You have to help take care of him
or something?

11:33.648 --> 11:35.524
Yeah, or something.

11:36.692 --> 11:39.445
He's not my baby brother, he's my son.

11:39.653 --> 11:41.071
Your son?

11:54.460 --> 11:57.462
I'm sorry, Brenda,
but you are not going skydiving.

11:59.048 --> 12:01.383
- Dad?
- Brenda,

12:01.508 --> 12:03.093
you won't even ride on a roller coaster.

12:03.176 --> 12:05.095
What makes you suddenly want
to jump out of a plane?

12:05.136 --> 12:06.805
Because I won something.

12:07.389 --> 12:10.225
What if you won two weeks in Siberia?

12:10.351 --> 12:12.936
I'd go. Just to see what it's like.

12:15.731 --> 12:17.149
You're home early.

12:17.191 --> 12:19.776
Brandon, you will not believe
what happened to me tonight.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.862
Let me guess.
Does it have anything to do

12:21.987 --> 12:24.156
with MC Hammer
and jumping out of an airplane?

12:24.240 --> 12:26.116
- You heard?
- Yeah.

12:26.825 --> 12:30.621
There I was, my most intimate moment,
getting ready to make my move,

12:30.662 --> 12:32.915
and who's on the radio? My sister.

12:33.165 --> 12:35.500
Yeah, everyone was listening.

12:35.584 --> 12:37.795
A city of 12 million people.

12:38.503 --> 12:40.630
I've got to claim my prize.

12:41.298 --> 12:44.217
Sounds like more of a punishment
if you ask me.

12:44.801 --> 12:46.094
- Good night.
- Good night.

12:46.177 --> 12:47.388
Good night.

12:48.430 --> 12:51.266
Bren, could I talk to you
for a minute upstairs?

12:51.767 --> 12:53.352
She has a baby?

12:53.643 --> 12:58.857
Yeah, and I'm probably the only person
in the whole school who didn't know.

13:00.025 --> 13:02.319
Make that one of the only two people.

13:04.196 --> 13:06.031
Brandon, who's the father?

13:06.115 --> 13:08.658
- Is she getting married?
- I don't know.

13:09.075 --> 13:11.912
- Well, what do her parents think?
- I don't know.

13:11.996 --> 13:14.331
I mean, how does she deal
with having a baby in high school?

13:14.414 --> 13:16.458
Brenda, I've got an idea.
Why don't you go out with her?

13:16.541 --> 13:19.169
You can ask her
all the questions you want.

13:20.421 --> 13:22.882
So are you going to ask her out again?

13:24.758 --> 13:26.051
I don't know.

13:29.429 --> 13:32.766
She was going out with this guy,
Frank Seltzer, who's also a senior.

13:32.808 --> 13:34.309
They were, like, this great couple,

13:34.351 --> 13:36.978
then bada-boom, bada-bing,
she got pregnant.

13:37.062 --> 13:38.021
Yeah?

13:38.188 --> 13:39.690
Most girls will take care
of the problem, Brandon.

13:39.773 --> 13:41.441
But Melissa decided
she wanted to keep the baby.

13:41.483 --> 13:43.402
Well, maybe to her it wasn't a problem.

13:43.485 --> 13:45.070
Maybe Frank didn't want to be a dad.

13:45.153 --> 13:48.448
Well, maybe Frank should've paid
more attention in sex education class.

13:48.532 --> 13:49.992
What are you saying? It's all his fault?

13:50.075 --> 13:52.827
I'm not saying it's anyone's fault,
Steve, it's just reality.

13:52.870 --> 13:54.454
Well, I think you need a reality check,

13:54.537 --> 13:58.541
because if you start going out with this
girl, it's gonna be nothing but problems.

13:58.584 --> 14:01.837
Thanks, Steve. This talk really helped,

14:02.170 --> 14:04.798
really put things in perspective for me.

14:05.173 --> 14:06.466
Anytime.

14:07.176 --> 14:10.804
- Hey, where are you going?
- To find Melissa.

14:10.887 --> 14:13.181
I'm gonna ask her out on Friday night.

14:17.311 --> 14:20.272
"C-? Melissa, we can do better."

14:22.190 --> 14:24.234
- Melissa.
- Hi, Amy.

14:24.276 --> 14:27.195
- Hi. How's Joey?
- Fine.

14:27.279 --> 14:31.116
I finally got him on formula, so I don't
have to run home for lunch every day.

14:31.199 --> 14:33.535
It was making me feel like a damn cow.

14:33.744 --> 14:35.454
But he's good.
You guys should come over

14:35.537 --> 14:37.705
and see him sometime. You wouldn't
believe how fast he's growing.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.374
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.752
I... I think I have a picture.

14:44.546 --> 14:46.715
This one isn't really a good one.

14:47.090 --> 14:50.177
- You're still thinking about Harvard?
- Definitely.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.429
I have an interview this weekend.

14:52.762 --> 14:55.848
- They have special housing, you know.
- That's great.

14:56.975 --> 14:59.186
Listen, we better go.
We've both got chem.

14:59.269 --> 15:00.770
- Okay.
- Bye.

15:00.854 --> 15:01.896
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.773
Look, what are you guys doing later?

15:03.856 --> 15:05.692
Hitting Melrose. You wanna come?

15:05.733 --> 15:08.403
Yeah, but, well, no, I can't with Joey.

15:08.528 --> 15:09.904
Sorry. See you later.

15:09.988 --> 15:11.406
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:11.614 --> 15:13.325
Amy, call me.

15:15.410 --> 15:18.121
Tell her to transfer to Beverly High.

15:23.585 --> 15:27.338
- Hey, where are you off to tonight?
- I have a date with Melissa.

15:27.547 --> 15:29.883
Brandon, this is getting serious.

15:29.925 --> 15:32.761
Brenda, two dates is hardly serious.

15:34.178 --> 15:35.555
I've gotta go.

15:35.597 --> 15:37.182
Where are you off to?

15:37.766 --> 15:40.852
- You swear you won't tell Mom?
- I swear.

15:44.231 --> 15:47.525
Kelly and I have
our first skydiving lesson tonight.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.986
- You're nuts!
- Maybe.

15:51.279 --> 15:52.447
Okay!

15:53.239 --> 15:55.241
Have a good time with "Mom."

15:56.785 --> 15:58.786
Why, what are we doing?

16:02.374 --> 16:04.459
Nothing, Mom. See you.

16:27.565 --> 16:30.777
This is what it's all about, folks.
Piece of cake, right?

16:31.403 --> 16:33.404
Wrong. There's a lot to know.

16:33.447 --> 16:35.407
But don't worry,
we're not going to just throw you

16:35.490 --> 16:38.493
out of a plane before giving you
a lot of on-ground-type simulation.

16:38.534 --> 16:40.745
I could simulate anything with this guy.

16:40.828 --> 16:42.831
- My name is Don.
- Yeah, he is pretty cute.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.958
Before this weekend is over,
I'm going to teach you

16:45.041 --> 16:47.919
all the skills necessary
to make your big jump on Sunday.

16:48.002 --> 16:49.880
I think I'm going to be sick.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.215
Would you relax? You're such a baby.

17:00.681 --> 17:01.975
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:02.058 --> 17:03.351
Come on in.

17:04.351 --> 17:06.645
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

17:08.647 --> 17:12.819
Do you know of any nice noisy places
to go to dinner?

17:14.487 --> 17:17.073
Sure. But why?

17:24.579 --> 17:25.790
Sorry about this.

17:25.873 --> 17:28.501
My parents went away for the weekend,
and the only baby-sitter I trust

17:28.584 --> 17:32.046
is coming over tomorrow
for the Harvard interview.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.174
Hey, it's an experience.

17:34.758 --> 17:37.927
Things must be pretty jamming
at the Coolidge household, huh?

17:38.052 --> 17:40.722
This is nothing. He's an angel tonight.

17:40.805 --> 17:42.098
Come on.

17:42.849 --> 17:45.726
So, how do your parents feel
about you being a mom?

17:45.810 --> 17:47.354
They're really supportive.

17:47.436 --> 17:51.774
When I told them that I wanted to have
the baby, they were right there for me.

17:51.857 --> 17:56.278
Hey, I'm all for it,
but what made you decide to keep him?

17:57.322 --> 18:00.449
I guess I felt I had
to take responsibility for my actions,

18:00.575 --> 18:03.327
and my parents supported my choice.

18:03.411 --> 18:05.246
- That's a big decision.
- Yeah.

18:05.330 --> 18:07.707
But, I mean, you can't let society
make the rules for you, Brandon.

18:07.791 --> 18:09.375
You know,
you've got to live by your own.

18:09.417 --> 18:10.835
Yeah, I totally agree.

18:10.918 --> 18:12.044
No one's going to tell me

18:12.127 --> 18:14.297
that just 'cause I have a baby
I can't go to Harvard.

18:14.380 --> 18:17.800
Hey, I come from a family
of overachievers, what can I say?

18:19.844 --> 18:21.179
Oh, Joey.

18:23.056 --> 18:25.266
What is this? What is this?

18:27.644 --> 18:29.979
Just what I love,
a crying baby coming in here

18:30.062 --> 18:32.065
and making a wreck of my place.

18:34.108 --> 18:36.569
Hi, how are you, tiger?

18:37.319 --> 18:39.071
Who's this? Your baby brother?

18:39.155 --> 18:40.531
Baby son.

18:41.156 --> 18:42.283
Son.

18:43.283 --> 18:44.910
Brandon, this isn't...

18:44.993 --> 18:48.789
Nat, do I look like the kind of guy
who'd keep a secret like this?

18:52.418 --> 18:54.587
He's much better looking than you.

18:56.839 --> 18:59.216
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

19:00.634 --> 19:03.846
He loves me. He's crazy about me.
Excuse me.

19:05.389 --> 19:08.184
So, what was it like when...

19:08.309 --> 19:12.730
When he just popped out
and you saw him for the first time?

19:12.813 --> 19:15.691
First of all, Brandon,
he did not just pop out.

19:15.775 --> 19:17.943
No, I guess... I guess not.

19:21.030 --> 19:23.949
You really want to know
what having a baby's like?

19:24.534 --> 19:27.245
- Yeah.
- It's like jumping off a cliff.

19:33.250 --> 19:36.920
Brandon. Hey, you look worn-out.

19:39.048 --> 19:41.801
- How did you guys ever do it?
- Do what?

19:42.634 --> 19:44.303
Have Brenda and me.

19:44.887 --> 19:48.099
Two of us at the same time.
I can't even imagine it.

19:48.182 --> 19:49.892
Where is this coming from?

19:50.393 --> 19:54.480
Oh, one thing I forgot
to tell you about Melissa.

19:55.189 --> 19:58.984
Besides being brilliant
and extremely cute, she has a baby.

19:59.360 --> 20:00.903
- What?
- What?

20:00.986 --> 20:04.657
Yeah. His name's Joey,
and he's a holy terror.

20:05.699 --> 20:08.160
I gotta get some sleep. Good night.

20:08.577 --> 20:13.082
Brandon, what do you mean,
Melissa has a baby?

20:13.582 --> 20:15.334
I mean, last year she got pregnant

20:15.417 --> 20:18.378
and instead of having an abortion
or putting the baby up for adoption,

20:18.421 --> 20:20.214
she's raising him at home.

20:21.173 --> 20:23.133
Her parents are totally supportive, Mom.

20:23.217 --> 20:25.761
And if they don't have a problem with it,
I don't see why you should.

20:25.845 --> 20:27.429
Oh, I... I don't.

20:27.555 --> 20:29.849
It just came as a surprise, that's all.

20:30.891 --> 20:32.684
It was hard enough for me in my 20s.

20:32.768 --> 20:34.770
It's hard enough for me now.

20:37.482 --> 20:40.067
I... I really like Melissa.

20:40.651 --> 20:44.488
But if I never see that kid again
it will be too soon.

20:44.572 --> 20:46.156
You know what I mean?

20:47.407 --> 20:49.368
- Good night.
- Good night, Son.

21:06.385 --> 21:08.887
Brandon? Brandon!

21:11.014 --> 21:12.641
Melissa's here.

21:18.397 --> 21:19.732
Brandon, you gotta help me.

21:19.773 --> 21:21.817
My baby-sitter called in sick
at the last minute.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.986
My Harvard interview is in a half-hour.

21:24.069 --> 21:26.363
If I cancel now I'll blow my chances.

21:26.447 --> 21:28.282
What are you going to do?

21:29.908 --> 21:33.829
I fed him this morning,
he gets his bottle at 11:00.

21:33.912 --> 21:35.080
The formula's already mixed.

21:35.164 --> 21:39.459
In this bag are his blanket,
pacifier, play toys, diapers.

21:42.587 --> 21:44.798
Thank you. You saved my life.

21:48.301 --> 21:50.220
All right, Joey, don't worry.

21:50.304 --> 21:55.059
Don't worry, everything is...
Everything is just fine.

21:55.142 --> 21:59.187
You know what I'm saying?
All right. Okay.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.606
Okay.

22:00.940 --> 22:02.774
Grab this stuff here.

22:03.651 --> 22:04.860
Just...

22:09.698 --> 22:14.119
Hey, hey, oh, no, no.
Don't, don't, hey, come...

22:15.830 --> 22:16.955
Mom!

22:19.333 --> 22:20.542
Mom!

22:26.924 --> 22:30.385
Oh, you cutesy-wutesy. Yes.

22:30.719 --> 22:32.471
What happened to Melissa?

22:33.013 --> 22:36.308
Her parents are out of town,
her baby-sitter bailed.

22:36.391 --> 22:39.186
She's got this Harvard interview today.

22:39.686 --> 22:41.230
You guys will help, right?

22:41.354 --> 22:43.190
Did I hear screams?

22:43.982 --> 22:46.443
- Come on, Cindy, we gotta go.
- Oh.

22:46.526 --> 22:49.779
- Where are you going?
- Brunch with Dad's client, remember?

22:50.280 --> 22:52.157
Oh, yeah.

22:52.865 --> 22:54.117
Oh, no.

22:54.660 --> 22:58.371
Oh, your skin's so soft
and you smell so good.

22:58.747 --> 23:00.248
Yes, you do.

23:00.708 --> 23:01.917
Hey, you know, guys,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.419
I don't want to break up
this little love-fest.

23:04.502 --> 23:06.379
So we'll go with you.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.133
I don't think that's exactly
the vocal accompaniment

23:09.216 --> 23:11.301
the Bel-Air Hotel is looking for.

23:11.426 --> 23:15.305
Get Brenda to help you.
She's a wonderful baby-sitter.

23:16.848 --> 23:18.767
Good luck, Dad.

23:26.733 --> 23:28.235
Is that Joey?

23:30.362 --> 23:31.821
I'm coming!

23:31.988 --> 23:34.199
- Where you going?
- Guess.

23:35.158 --> 23:38.370
Brenda, you can't go skydiving.
You're afraid of heights, remember?

23:38.453 --> 23:41.122
Hi. Don said
that you can't even see the ground.

23:41.164 --> 23:43.500
Think about that for a second,
just think about that.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.669
You can't see the ground. That's high!

23:45.752 --> 23:47.546
Here, take him.

23:48.255 --> 23:51.967
Now, this will make him
feel close to the womb.

23:52.967 --> 23:54.553
I'm impressed.

23:54.594 --> 23:58.390
I think you owe Joey
the knowledge of your expertise here.

24:03.645 --> 24:06.607
- Following me again?
- In your sweetest X-rated dreams.

24:06.689 --> 24:07.857
Sorry, Kel.

24:07.941 --> 24:11.152
Brandon's having some problems
adjusting to fatherhood.

24:11.236 --> 24:12.362
I'll pay you, Bren.

24:12.487 --> 24:15.198
- Brandon looks so cute with that baby.
- What's it doing here?

24:15.281 --> 24:17.200
We're supposed to be watching
the Lakers game.

24:17.284 --> 24:19.911
What if Mom and Dad find out
you went parachuting, huh?

24:19.995 --> 24:21.329
I'm only looking out for you.

24:21.412 --> 24:24.457
Brandon, I have to go through with this.
Look my fear in the eye.

24:24.541 --> 24:25.542
Actually, you don't.

24:25.625 --> 24:28.503
You stay here
and I will brave the lesson myself.

24:28.921 --> 24:30.964
You just want to hog Don.

24:31.131 --> 24:33.591
- Don. Who's Don?
- Don Juan.

24:34.509 --> 24:38.596
Can I hold? Oh, hi, there.

24:38.930 --> 24:40.015
Hi.

24:40.098 --> 24:42.559
Oh, I think our baby
would have been cuter.

24:42.642 --> 24:44.644
Oh, look at the proud parents.

24:45.604 --> 24:48.648
- Right, thank God for safe sex.
- Hallelujah.

24:48.731 --> 24:52.902
I think his diaper needs changing. Yeah.

24:53.445 --> 24:56.531
Wait a minute,
I don't know how to change a diaper.

24:56.615 --> 24:58.658
<i>Didn't you see Three Men and a Baby?</i>

24:58.742 --> 25:02.537
<i>- Did you see Three Men and a Baby?
- Yeah. We got it under control.</i>

25:03.330 --> 25:06.249
<i>Yeah, Three Men and a Baby.
We want to rent it.</i>

25:07.208 --> 25:08.376
What?

25:15.216 --> 25:16.801
You're kidding.

25:18.970 --> 25:22.098
<i>They don't have it,
but they do have the Three Amigos!</i>

25:25.143 --> 25:27.895
- What is this?
- That's a diaper, Steve.

25:35.987 --> 25:38.948
- Joey.
- Joey.

25:39.949 --> 25:42.243
This kid's gonna be a power forward.

25:42.327 --> 25:44.495
Can you imagine this for real?

25:44.579 --> 25:47.832
Yeah, maybe someday
in the far, far, far future.

25:47.915 --> 25:49.918
After I've done everything else.

25:50.001 --> 25:51.919
All right, I got this one.
Come on, come on.

25:52.003 --> 25:53.171
Ta-da!

25:58.760 --> 26:00.804
Maybe when you're really, really old,

26:00.845 --> 26:03.014
you won't mind
your social life being nuked.

26:03.139 --> 26:04.975
Yeah, maybe.

26:06.935 --> 26:08.352
When Kelly and I were going together,

26:08.436 --> 26:10.813
we used to talk about
who our baby'd look like.

26:11.356 --> 26:13.274
Of course,
she'd be the one who'd bring it up.

26:13.400 --> 26:16.610
No, Steve is the one
who fantasized about having kids.

26:16.820 --> 26:20.531
Can you imagine him as a father?
What a sick joke.

26:20.781 --> 26:24.034
You know, it's so unfair.
I mean, Melissa is already a mom,

26:24.118 --> 26:28.039
and taking care of a baby and I'm still
sneaking around for one stupid skydive.

26:28.123 --> 26:29.666
Yeah, but I bet she did her fair share

26:29.749 --> 26:32.418
of sneaking around
in order to become a mom.

26:33.294 --> 26:34.712
Oh, my God.

26:35.338 --> 26:37.340
He looks even more gorgeous today.

26:37.423 --> 26:39.884
Yeah, I'd like to sneak around with him.

26:40.676 --> 26:43.137
- Hi, Don!
- Don, wait up!

26:45.098 --> 26:48.726
- This kid needs bootie camp.
- Hey, hey, hey.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.980
Well, at least the diapers are holding.

26:52.063 --> 26:55.441
Hey, Joey, Joey.

26:56.525 --> 26:58.111
Hey, hey, hey.

27:00.363 --> 27:02.615
You gotta sing when you rock him.

27:02.740 --> 27:06.744
<i>Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree-top</i>

27:06.786 --> 27:08.496
<i>When the wind...</i>

27:08.580 --> 27:09.622
I don't blame you, Joey.

27:09.747 --> 27:12.417
Some weird guy
throwing you around like that.

27:12.959 --> 27:15.253
Can you do better, huh?

27:25.013 --> 27:27.014
Diaper rash.

27:27.098 --> 27:30.059
I think we all learnt something
from that, Mr Mom.

27:30.643 --> 27:33.729
Maybe he's hungry.
Bring him over here, sit him down.

27:36.774 --> 27:39.152
Look. Look what I got here.

27:40.027 --> 27:41.153
Yes.

27:46.158 --> 27:49.537
Delicious. Oh, look, look at this.

27:56.252 --> 27:59.005
I don't think
he shared that opinion, Brandon.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.803
Okay, Brenda, just relax now.

28:05.928 --> 28:08.889
Your chute will open automatically
after 30 seconds of free fall.

28:08.973 --> 28:11.141
In case of a problem,
there's a second backup chute.

28:11.225 --> 28:13.060
It's absolutely fail-safe.

28:13.394 --> 28:15.646
Now I want you
to hit the ground rolling, okay?

28:15.771 --> 28:17.481
But it's so high.

28:20.568 --> 28:22.194
So are the stakes.

28:22.278 --> 28:24.697
You've got to spit
in the face of fear, Brenda.

28:24.781 --> 28:27.533
The future of the Allies is in your hands.

28:28.785 --> 28:31.287
I understand. I won't let you down.

28:31.578 --> 28:33.080
And if you survive,

28:33.206 --> 28:37.793
we'll go to a nice romantic French bistro
for dinner. On me.

28:38.377 --> 28:39.670
I'm ready.

28:47.178 --> 28:49.222
That wasn't too painful, was it?

28:49.930 --> 28:52.015
No, just the re-entry.

28:52.099 --> 28:55.477
Do you need more altitude awareness
or can we go on to forward movement?

28:55.603 --> 28:57.230
She can jump with her eyes closed.

28:57.271 --> 29:00.649
But I do need a little help
with my forward movement.

29:00.733 --> 29:01.901
Okay.

29:01.983 --> 29:03.318
Step down.

29:05.529 --> 29:08.491
- Come on, let's put the game on.
- Oh, yeah.

29:12.369 --> 29:16.165
- What's wrong?
- Damn it. The cable's out again.

29:16.415 --> 29:19.877
- Don't worry. We'll watch it at my house.
- How can I?

29:20.502 --> 29:22.296
Bye, sports fans.

29:22.379 --> 29:25.215
- Hey, thanks for your help, man.
- See you, bro.

29:29.845 --> 29:32.431
Well, looks like
it's just you and me, huh?

29:32.557 --> 29:35.309
Who needs a picture?
We got sound. Right?

29:35.392 --> 29:37.728
You want some more ice cream? Joey.

29:37.811 --> 29:39.938
Joey, you want some more ice cream?

29:41.607 --> 29:44.193
How about some of this?
You want some of this? Look.

29:46.362 --> 29:48.072
Come on in, Steve.

29:52.076 --> 29:55.453
All right, you stay here, okay, Joey?
I'll be right back.

29:59.833 --> 30:01.961
Hi, come in.

30:03.296 --> 30:05.423
You can listen to the game with us.

30:08.843 --> 30:10.469
Hi, sweetheart.

30:13.889 --> 30:16.475
- Is he eating ice cream?
- Yeah.

30:18.268 --> 30:21.897
Brandon, how could you be
so irresponsible?

30:22.314 --> 30:24.441
Wait a second, you're the one
who dumped him on me

30:24.525 --> 30:26.192
at the last minute, remember?

30:26.276 --> 30:29.280
Yeah, we had some problems.
But now we're cooking.

30:31.741 --> 30:32.908
What's wrong?

30:33.325 --> 30:35.244
My interview was a complete disaster.

30:35.369 --> 30:37.496
This guy was a conservative jerk.

30:37.538 --> 30:40.749
He said he had serious doubts
I could handle Harvard with a kid.

30:40.832 --> 30:43.376
So why don't you try
for another interview?

30:43.794 --> 30:46.588
I just... I think I made a mistake
in deciding to be a mom.

30:46.629 --> 30:49.299
I just feel like a total failure at it.

30:49.383 --> 30:51.551
Yeah, you expect too much.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.513
After today,
I'm amazed you handle it so well.

30:54.596 --> 30:56.807
Well, apparently not well enough.

30:58.309 --> 31:00.185
You don't understand.

31:00.269 --> 31:02.771
My mom went to Harvard.
She expects me to go there, too.

31:02.896 --> 31:07.109
I mean, it's been my dream
since before I can remember.

31:07.192 --> 31:10.821
But if my grades keep dropping like this,
I might as well just forget it all.

31:10.862 --> 31:13.865
Hey, when I first came here,
my grades dropped.

31:13.991 --> 31:16.201
It was hard for me to adjust, but I did.

31:16.285 --> 31:18.036
Brandon, it's not the same thing.

31:18.162 --> 31:20.289
You were the new kid for a minute.

31:20.372 --> 31:22.040
I'm the new mom forever.

31:23.291 --> 31:25.085
Look, I gotta go.

31:37.389 --> 31:39.016
Melissa, wait!

31:58.243 --> 32:02.247
- I'm not even gonna ask.
- Don said to practice.

32:04.375 --> 32:07.544
I figure it'll be just like this, only more.

32:08.962 --> 32:10.672
12,000 feet more.

32:11.298 --> 32:15.969
You know, I really hate it
when you crinkle the funny pages.

32:16.553 --> 32:18.722
Gee, you're cheery today.

32:20.140 --> 32:23.351
I... I just feel so bad about Melissa.

32:24.728 --> 32:26.271
She was really upset.

32:26.688 --> 32:29.775
So how are you gonna get back
into her good graces?

32:30.192 --> 32:33.570
- Or, more importantly, Joey's?
- You know, he really liked me.

32:33.653 --> 32:36.698
Yeah, well,
babies usually like other babies.

32:38.784 --> 32:40.869
You know, I really admire Melissa.

32:41.245 --> 32:42.912
It's hard enough being a teenager.

32:42.996 --> 32:45.581
I sit here and worry
about clothes and guys.

32:45.832 --> 32:48.126
She has to think about real things.

32:48.209 --> 32:50.253
- Morning. Morning.
- Morning.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.213
- Hi, Mom.
- I have got a great idea.

32:52.339 --> 32:54.216
Let's have a family day
the way we used to.

32:54.299 --> 32:56.259
I mean, we could go to the zoo.
There's a new panda.

32:56.343 --> 32:59.512
Your mom's been in the nesting mode
since she got her hands on that baby.

32:59.596 --> 33:01.806
Well, you two guys
will be flying off so soon.

33:01.890 --> 33:03.642
Sooner than you think.

33:03.725 --> 33:05.602
I promised Kelly I'd study with her.

33:05.686 --> 33:07.813
Yeah, I gotta go
straighten something out.

33:07.937 --> 33:10.482
Mom, is it okay
if I borrow your car again?

33:10.982 --> 33:12.567
- Sure.
- Thanks.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.201
You know,
I hate lying to them about skydiving.

33:21.326 --> 33:23.453
But if I can do this, I can do anything.

33:23.536 --> 33:25.622
It's my one leap of faith.

33:25.789 --> 33:28.916
Sounds like more of a leap
of brain cells, if you ask me.

33:29.042 --> 33:31.043
- I've got it.
- Got what?

33:32.170 --> 33:34.005
How you can cheer up Melissa.

33:48.687 --> 33:50.814
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.651
I've come bearing make-up gifts.

34:04.953 --> 34:06.496
I'm sorry, too.

34:07.830 --> 34:10.708
I've got an idea.
Why don't we make up on a drive?

34:11.208 --> 34:13.168
I promise not to sing.

34:13.543 --> 34:17.255
Great. We could... We could take Joey
to the beach. Where is he?

34:17.382 --> 34:19.842
Blissfully asleep. My parents are back.

34:19.925 --> 34:22.804
I thought it could just be the two of us.

34:23.804 --> 34:26.389
Mom, Brandon and I
are gonna go for a drive.

34:26.474 --> 34:28.184
We'll be back in a little bit.

34:28.309 --> 34:30.811
Just remember your father and I
both have to work tonight.

34:30.895 --> 34:32.772
Okay. Don't worry, we won't be long.

34:32.855 --> 34:35.984
- Say hi to Joey for me!
- Will do, Brandon.

34:47.536 --> 34:49.956
We'll just grab a bite and head back.

34:51.748 --> 34:53.585
I feel so out of it.

34:56.254 --> 34:59.215
All I've been hearing are Raffi lullabies.

35:00.300 --> 35:03.344
Hey, did I tell you how basketball
calmed down Joey?

35:03.636 --> 35:05.221
It was amazing.

35:05.388 --> 35:07.807
Yeah, I used to watch a lot of basketball
with my dad

35:07.891 --> 35:09.809
when I was pregnant with Joey.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.145
Do they really remember?

35:13.688 --> 35:15.648
I wonder what it was like
for him in there.

35:15.690 --> 35:18.067
Listen, baby care is on recess, okay?

35:19.569 --> 35:20.778
Sure.

35:22.071 --> 35:25.158
I'm sorry.
I think I just really need a break.

35:28.786 --> 35:32.707
Did you ever want to make a turn,
like that one right there?

35:33.249 --> 35:35.168
I've always wanted to do that.

35:36.127 --> 35:38.212
Do it, Brandon. Let's turn there.

35:43.593 --> 35:46.595
I used to be so scared
I couldn't find my way back.

35:46.846 --> 35:48.305
Not anymore.

35:49.056 --> 35:51.559
I feel like doing something so crazy.

35:51.643 --> 35:53.269
It must be in the air.

35:53.770 --> 35:57.941
Right at this moment Kelly and Brenda
are probably jumping out of a plane.

36:07.575 --> 36:10.161
Okay, we're leveling off at 12,000 feet!

36:10.244 --> 36:12.414
You girls ready to make the jump?

36:13.957 --> 36:16.292
I almost puked off
the Empire State Building.

36:16.334 --> 36:18.627
That was 11,000 feet lower.

36:18.711 --> 36:20.921
Oh, relax. It's almost over.

36:21.464 --> 36:22.673
I don't know, Kel.

36:22.757 --> 36:25.218
This might have to be
a solo mission on your part.

36:25.301 --> 36:28.596
No way, Brenda. I'm not leaving you
up here with Don Juan.

36:28.721 --> 36:31.390
Don, you know I wanted to sign up

36:31.473 --> 36:34.394
for one of those private flights
you were talking about.

36:34.477 --> 36:36.312
Sorry, Bren, three's a crowd.

36:36.354 --> 36:38.355
You know, Kelly,
since you're so jump-crazy,

36:38.439 --> 36:41.109
why don't you jump first
and Don and I will watch you?

36:41.191 --> 36:44.862
Brenda, I couldn't do that to you.
You're my best friend.

36:44.946 --> 36:47.782
- I have to help you face your fears.
- No, Kelly, this isn't about...

36:59.460 --> 37:02.963
- This is so amazing!
- Brenda, get me down!

37:27.821 --> 37:31.367
- So, should we head back?
- No.

37:35.078 --> 37:36.747
Let's go further.

37:37.248 --> 37:39.959
Whoa! You're making it hard to drive.

37:41.210 --> 37:42.878
So stop driving.

37:53.055 --> 37:56.433
- You're not acting like yourself.
- Great.

37:56.517 --> 37:59.603
Because right now
I'd rather be anybody else.

38:12.575 --> 38:14.535
Let's get really lost.

38:15.244 --> 38:17.996
Stay up all night, watch the sun rise.

38:19.748 --> 38:21.584
Sounds like a nice fantasy.

38:22.877 --> 38:24.795
We could do it if we want to.

38:25.004 --> 38:26.421
Leave Joey?

38:27.089 --> 38:28.799
What are you, his father?

38:30.592 --> 38:32.803
Look, I feel guilty enough.

38:35.430 --> 38:39.310
I feel guilty when I'm with him,
I feel guilty when I'm not with him.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.980
Suddenly you have a baby
and nobody cares about you.

38:45.357 --> 38:49.069
Just for a second
I would like to be a teenage girl,

38:49.403 --> 38:51.655
and not a damn baby machine.

38:52.448 --> 38:54.533
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

38:54.825 --> 38:56.743
Come here, it's okay.

39:03.291 --> 39:05.001
I can handle it.

39:06.754 --> 39:09.172
Why don't you just take me home?

39:12.009 --> 39:14.261
Six-letter word for patience.

39:19.683 --> 39:21.226
Hi, honey. What's up?

39:23.562 --> 39:26.690
Mom, Dad, I have a confession.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.818
I went skydiving.

39:30.610 --> 39:33.822
- Brenda, didn't we agree?
- Dad, let me tell you,

39:34.406 --> 39:37.993
after staring at death,
copping to this is easy.

39:38.994 --> 39:41.997
I mean,
I've seen a larger meaning of life.

39:42.831 --> 39:46.168
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I feel bad having lied to you.

39:50.005 --> 39:52.424
Brenda, how was it?

39:53.675 --> 39:54.927
Great!

40:01.892 --> 40:03.102
Parent.

40:05.145 --> 40:07.230
A six-letter word for patience.

40:08.107 --> 40:10.650
I love it when you talk crossword.

40:22.996 --> 40:24.080
Hi.

40:41.098 --> 40:42.933
We had nowhere to go.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.477
Oh, God, I'm so lost.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.604
Hey, what happened?

40:48.188 --> 40:50.858
When I got home,
my parents were really mad.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.778
They said I stayed out deliberately.

40:55.195 --> 40:58.657
My mom had a meeting
with a new client and I blew it for her.

40:59.992 --> 41:01.451
More guilt.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.703
Just what you need, huh?

41:04.246 --> 41:06.581
What am I gonna do, Brandon?

41:08.208 --> 41:12.378
Hey, why don't you let me take Joey
off your hands for a couple days, huh?

41:12.462 --> 41:14.255
We'll have some fun.
We'll shoot some hoops,

41:14.339 --> 41:16.758
we'll check out the local jungle gyms.

41:17.342 --> 41:18.552
Thanks.

41:20.470 --> 41:23.932
But, as much as I don't want to,

41:25.642 --> 41:28.103
I think I'm gonna have to give him up.

41:28.937 --> 41:30.772
What are you talking about?

41:31.189 --> 41:36.903
I... I can't handle the idea of being away
from him for even a few days.

41:37.863 --> 41:41.950
But I just don't think I can make
my dreams come true with him.

41:42.034 --> 41:45.704
You know, when I see you with Joey,

41:45.787 --> 41:48.540
this amazing thing happens
to your face.

41:48.623 --> 41:49.791
I know.

41:50.750 --> 41:53.962
I know.
But I just wasn't prepared for all this.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.798
I know what you mean. I do.

41:58.425 --> 42:01.928
At first I thought
Joey was a royal pain in the butt,

42:02.262 --> 42:05.056
but now I see
that this baby stuff is amazing.

42:05.140 --> 42:08.852
- I could even see myself doing it.
- In 10 years, right?

42:12.606 --> 42:16.150
Hi. Everything okay?

42:16.401 --> 42:18.820
I'm sorry, I'm a complete mess.

42:23.783 --> 42:25.827
- Mom, could you...
- Yeah.

42:33.460 --> 42:35.962
I used to chain-read before Joey.

42:39.299 --> 42:41.342
I read about this study

42:41.468 --> 42:46.056
where two professional football players
followed toddlers around all day.

42:47.849 --> 42:51.603
The football players collapsed
and the toddlers were still going.

42:52.645 --> 42:55.314
- You mean it gets harder?
- And better.

42:55.524 --> 42:57.942
You watch them grow and achieve.

42:58.193 --> 42:59.778
They become part of your dreams.

42:59.861 --> 43:02.614
Yeah, but you weren't a mom
when you were 17.

43:03.740 --> 43:05.700
But I was young enough.

43:09.162 --> 43:13.374
Sometimes I feel
like I just have to get away from Joey.

43:13.750 --> 43:17.170
And then when I'm gone,
I can't wait to hold him again.

43:17.253 --> 43:19.547
Remember the earthquake last month?

43:20.006 --> 43:22.133
I ran into Joey's room, I grabbed him.

43:22.216 --> 43:24.928
I kept him with me all night.
It was for me.

43:25.219 --> 43:27.179
My first impulse
was to pack everybody up

43:27.305 --> 43:29.432
and take them back to Minneapolis.

43:31.350 --> 43:34.855
I guess I didn't realize
it would be so complicated.

43:35.438 --> 43:37.607
I thought I could do everything.

43:37.690 --> 43:40.402
Melissa, no one can do everything.

43:43.113 --> 43:45.698
The question is, what do you want?

43:57.293 --> 43:59.880
Hey, am I in time for the concert?

44:02.924 --> 44:05.093
- You look good.
- Yeah, right.

44:05.718 --> 44:07.387
I was up all night with Joey.

44:07.470 --> 44:10.098
- Guess what? He said "mama."
- Really?

44:10.431 --> 44:14.019
Actually it was more like "maaaa,"
but it's a start.

44:14.435 --> 44:16.645
I'm telling you, he's a brilliant kid.

44:16.729 --> 44:19.023
It's what they say when they need you.

44:19.148 --> 44:24.404
- You up for a tuna-egg combo?
- Yeah, but no. I gotta go home.

44:24.653 --> 44:27.824
- Why, is something wrong?
- No, actually, something's very right.

44:27.949 --> 44:29.241
I worked out a half-time schedule,

44:29.408 --> 44:31.869
it wasn't as hard
as I thought it was going to be.

44:31.953 --> 44:33.705
And what about Harvard?

44:33.996 --> 44:35.372
I might take an extra semester.

44:35.498 --> 44:37.082
That school's been there
hundreds of years,

44:37.166 --> 44:38.876
it can wait another six months.

44:38.918 --> 44:42.672
- So you're gonna keep Joey?
- He's a part of me.

44:43.214 --> 44:47.802
Well, how about dinner Friday night,

44:47.885 --> 44:49.178
just the three of us?

44:49.261 --> 44:50.763
Can I take a rain check?

44:50.846 --> 44:53.224
I think Joey and I
need to hang out together.

44:53.265 --> 44:54.600
You know, just the two of us.

44:54.642 --> 44:58.103
God, I've never been dumped
for such a cute guy. All right, okay.

44:58.187 --> 45:02.024
- I get visitation rights, okay?
- You bet.

45:17.748 --> 45:18.874
Bye.
