02:22.575 --> 02:24.600
Peter.

02:27.614 --> 02:30.481
You could not watch
even one hour with me?

02:31.150 --> 02:33.550
Master, what has happened to you?

02:33.653 --> 02:35.177
Should I call the others, Lord?

02:35.521 --> 02:39.651
No, John.
I don't want them to see me like this.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.553
Are you in danger?
Should we flee, Master?

02:43.162 --> 02:46.063
Stay here. Watch...

02:47.567 --> 02:48.693
...pray.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.910
What is wrong with him?

03:06.786 --> 03:08.845
He seems afraid.

03:09.289 --> 03:12.781
He had spoken about danger
while we ate...

03:13.359 --> 03:16.294
He mentioned betrayal and...

03:37.317 --> 03:38.375
Thirty.

03:38.951 --> 03:40.816
Thirty, Judas.

03:41.321 --> 03:45.724
That was the agreement
between me... and you?

03:46.359 --> 03:47.451
Yes.

04:32.271 --> 04:34.136
Where?

04:35.441 --> 04:37.705
Where is he?

05:11.677 --> 05:14.737
Hear me, Father.

05:16.916 --> 05:21.819
Rise up, defend me.

05:26.759 --> 05:31.560
Save me from the traps they set for me.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.788
Do you really believe...

05:56.189 --> 06:00.455
...that one man can bear...

06:00.560 --> 06:02.926
...the full burden of sin?

06:03.596 --> 06:05.894
Shelter me, O Lord.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.763
I trust in You.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.338
In You I take refuge.

06:20.213 --> 06:24.673
No one man can carry this burden...

06:26.052 --> 06:27.576
...I tell you.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.922
It is far too heavy.

06:31.424 --> 06:35.326
Saving their souls is too costly.

06:36.295 --> 06:39.696
No one. Ever.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.229
No.

06:43.769 --> 06:44.895
Never.

06:47.073 --> 06:51.407
Father, you can do all things.

06:54.547 --> 06:59.041
If it is possible, let this chalice
pass from me...

07:02.655 --> 07:04.782
But let Your will be done...

07:07.627 --> 07:09.561
...not mine.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.015
Who is your father?

07:45.831 --> 07:47.696
Who are you?

09:46.986 --> 09:48.317
Who are you looking for?

09:53.659 --> 09:56.127
We're looking for Jesus of Nazareth.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.324
I am he.

10:30.863 --> 10:32.524
Hail, Rabbi!

10:45.711 --> 10:47.110
Judas...

10:48.047 --> 10:52.950
...you betray the Son of Man
with a kiss?

12:53.172 --> 12:54.332
Peter!

12:57.009 --> 12:58.033
Put it down!

12:59.044 --> 13:04.004
Those who live by the sword
shall die by the sword.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.389
Put it down.

13:48.594 --> 13:51.119
Malchus! Get up!

13:51.630 --> 13:53.427
We've got him. Let's go!

14:13.485 --> 14:15.749
What, Mary? What is it?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.327
Listen...

14:24.930 --> 14:29.890
"Why is this night different
from every other night?"

14:33.939 --> 14:37.238
"Because once we were slaves...

14:37.609 --> 14:40.237
"...and we are slaves no longer..."

14:50.889 --> 14:51.913
They've seized him!

16:22.414 --> 16:26.316
Everyone you can, hear?
To the courtyard of the High Priest.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.685
Quick! Go!

17:59.278 --> 18:00.973
Halt! Not so fast.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.571
This is not your party,
you toothless vermin.

18:11.657 --> 18:12.817
Peter...

18:24.002 --> 18:27.995
Hey! What's going on here?

18:28.106 --> 18:29.869
In there! Stop them!

18:30.475 --> 18:31.999
They've arrested him!

18:32.511 --> 18:35.275
In secret! In the night!

18:35.647 --> 18:37.945
To hide their crime from you!

18:38.317 --> 18:39.409
Stop them!

18:39.818 --> 18:42.252
What are you yelling about, woman?

18:42.688 --> 18:43.950
Who have they arrested?

18:45.224 --> 18:46.418
Jesus.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.190
Jesus of Nazareth!

18:48.393 --> 18:49.690
Shut up!

18:57.202 --> 18:58.169
She's crazy.

18:58.971 --> 19:04.136
A criminal.
Brought in for questioning, that's all.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.310
Broke the temple laws.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.255
I see.

19:19.291 --> 19:23.159
Better go tell him
there's more trouble brewing.

19:23.695 --> 19:24.662
Tell who?

19:26.131 --> 19:27.689
Abenader, you idiot.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.831
Get going!

19:31.903 --> 19:32.767
Go!

20:16.114 --> 20:17.308
Jesus...

20:34.866 --> 20:35.992
Are you hungry?

20:38.970 --> 20:40.437
Yes, I am.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.672
This is certainly a tall table!

20:53.018 --> 20:53.985
Who is it for?

20:54.519 --> 20:55.816
A rich man.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.449
Does he like to eat standing up?

21:03.295 --> 21:06.822
No. He prefers to eat like... so.

21:08.266 --> 21:11.235
Tall table, tall chairs!

21:11.937 --> 21:14.428
Well, I haven't made them yet.

21:30.655 --> 21:32.589
This will never catch on!

21:33.625 --> 21:35.183
Oh, no you don't!

21:35.560 --> 21:38.927
Take off that dirty apron
before you come in.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.126
And wash your hands.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.595
It has begun, Lord.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.331
So be it.

22:50.235 --> 22:51.702
Sir, there's trouble at...

22:51.803 --> 22:54.203
What, in the middle of the night,
Abenader?

22:54.406 --> 22:55.532
I'm sorry.

22:55.674 --> 22:56.606
What's the problem?

22:57.476 --> 22:59.103
Trouble within the walls.

22:59.511 --> 23:02.674
Caiphas had some prophet arrested.

23:02.981 --> 23:03.675
Who?

23:04.883 --> 23:06.510
Some Galilean.

23:06.952 --> 23:09.546
The Pharisees apparently hate the man.

23:09.654 --> 23:12.418
A Galilean? Who are you talking about?

23:13.658 --> 23:16.422
Who is this beggar you bring to us...

23:17.329 --> 23:20.230
...chained up like a condemned man?

23:20.899 --> 23:24.357
He's Jesus, the Nazarene troublemaker.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.200
You're Jesus of Nazareth?

23:29.808 --> 23:32.800
They say you're a king.

23:33.311 --> 23:34.869
Where is this kingdom of yours?

23:35.447 --> 23:38.382
What line of kings do you descend from?

23:38.650 --> 23:39.981
Speak up!

23:41.553 --> 23:45.011
You're just the son
of some obscure carpenter, no?

23:46.958 --> 23:49.256
Some say you're Elijah.

23:50.128 --> 23:52.824
But he was carried off to heaven
in a chariot!

23:54.599 --> 23:56.931
Why don't you say something?

23:57.669 --> 24:02.197
You've been brought here
as a blasphemer!

24:03.642 --> 24:05.837
What do you say to that?

24:06.244 --> 24:08.109
Defend yourself.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.447
I have spoken openly to everyone.

24:16.888 --> 24:18.185
I've taught...

24:18.957 --> 24:23.860
...in the temple where we all gather.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.427
Ask those
who have heard what I have to say.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.724
Is that how you address the high priest?

24:32.637 --> 24:33.934
With arrogance?

24:48.353 --> 24:50.218
If I have spoken evil...

24:50.956 --> 24:53.322
...tell me what evil I have said.

24:54.793 --> 24:58.456
But if not, why do you hit me?

25:01.199 --> 25:03.861
Yes, we'll listen to those
who heard your blasphemies.

25:05.036 --> 25:06.003
Good!

25:08.807 --> 25:10.672
Let's hear them.

25:11.309 --> 25:14.244
He cures the sick by magic!

25:15.413 --> 25:17.643
With the help of devils!

25:18.850 --> 25:20.477
I've seen it.

25:21.586 --> 25:26.546
He casts out devils,
with the help of devils.

25:31.563 --> 25:36.227
He calls himself the king of the Jews!

25:38.403 --> 25:41.429
No, he calls himself the son of God!

25:41.940 --> 25:45.034
He said
he would destroy the temple...

25:45.944 --> 25:49.004
...and rebuild it in three days!

25:50.815 --> 25:52.715
Worse!

25:53.418 --> 25:56.285
He claims he's the bread of life!

25:56.788 --> 26:01.521
And if we don't eat his flesh
or drink his blood...

26:01.893 --> 26:04.453
...we won't inherit eternal life.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.159
Silence!

26:08.266 --> 26:11.827
You're all under this man's spell.

26:12.370 --> 26:16.602
Either offer proof of his wrongdoing...

26:19.210 --> 26:21.007
...or be quiet!

26:21.546 --> 26:25.710
This entire proceeding is an outrage.

26:26.384 --> 26:30.753
All I've heard from these witnesses
is mindless contradiction!

26:42.734 --> 26:44.929
Who called this meeting anyway?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.234
And at this hour of the night?

26:47.539 --> 26:51.168
Where are the other members
of the council?

26:51.710 --> 26:52.904
Get him out of here!

26:56.414 --> 26:57.438
Get out!

26:58.049 --> 27:01.780
A travesty!
That's what this is, a beastly travesty!

27:10.028 --> 27:12.462
Haven't you anything to say?

27:13.231 --> 27:14.892
No answer to these accusations?

27:17.702 --> 27:21.695
I ask you now...

27:22.674 --> 27:24.699
...Jesus of Nazareth...

27:25.910 --> 27:30.142
Tell us, are you the Messiah?

27:31.816 --> 27:35.718
The son of the living God?

27:47.499 --> 27:49.296
I AM...

27:50.368 --> 27:53.462
...and you will see the Son of Man
seated at the right hand of power...

27:54.873 --> 27:57.967
...and coming on the clouds of heaven.

28:02.413 --> 28:04.574
Blasphemy!

28:06.684 --> 28:08.652
You heard him.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.080
There's no need for witnesses!

28:13.391 --> 28:18.351
Your verdict. What is your verdict?

28:20.532 --> 28:22.591
Death!

29:15.386 --> 29:18.651
Haven't I seen you
in the company of the Galilean?

29:19.123 --> 29:21.523
Yes! You're one of his disciples!

29:22.227 --> 29:24.218
I recognize you!

29:24.629 --> 29:27.598
Quiet! I've never met the man.
I don't know him.

29:28.366 --> 29:31.233
You are Peter!
One of the disciples of Jesus.

29:36.074 --> 29:39.168
I don't know the man! You are wrong!

29:40.245 --> 29:41.371
Stop! Stop!

29:41.746 --> 29:43.043
I've seen you before!

29:43.481 --> 29:45.779
Stop him! He's one of them!

29:47.952 --> 29:50.580
You're wrong, damn you!

29:51.456 --> 29:54.357
I swear I don't know the man.

29:55.260 --> 29:58.559
I've never seen him before.

30:06.671 --> 30:09.139
Wherever you go, Lord...

30:09.841 --> 30:13.538
...I will follow.

30:16.214 --> 30:20.674
To prison, even to death.

30:24.722 --> 30:27.190
Amen, I say to you...

30:29.794 --> 30:32.763
...before the cock crows...

30:35.400 --> 30:38.335
...three times you will deny me.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.858
Peter?

31:19.711 --> 31:22.236
No, no... I am unworthy!

31:23.348 --> 31:26.840
I have denied him, Mother!

31:27.952 --> 31:31.410
Denied him three times.

31:43.835 --> 31:47.703
Let's go! You take care of it.

31:51.542 --> 31:54.739
Let him pass. He's harmless.

31:56.748 --> 31:58.545
Release him!

32:00.284 --> 32:02.184
Take back the silver.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.053
Here!

32:06.424 --> 32:10.019
I've sinned, betrayed innocent blood.

32:12.697 --> 32:17.066
Take back your silver. I don't want it!

32:17.602 --> 32:22.562
If you think you've betrayed innocent
blood, that's your affair.

32:23.808 --> 32:25.776
Take your money and go.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.601
Now go!

32:55.573 --> 32:57.268
What's wrong? Are you all right?

32:58.109 --> 33:00.134
Look at his mouth.
Hey, can we look at it?

33:00.511 --> 33:02.672
You need help? Can we help?

33:03.748 --> 33:05.409
He's bleeding! Look! Blood!

33:08.286 --> 33:11.414
Leave me alone...

33:12.423 --> 33:13.583
...you little satans!

33:14.725 --> 33:17.990
Aha! Cursing! Are you cursed?

33:18.262 --> 33:19.923
He's cursed!

33:20.231 --> 33:22.165
Yes, a curse! It's inside him, look!

33:34.745 --> 33:37.805
Watch out, it's like burning oil
from his bones!

33:42.553 --> 33:46.353
Get away from me! Leave me alone!

38:04.749 --> 38:08.082
Don't condemn this Galilean.

38:08.419 --> 38:09.784
He's holy.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.615
You will only bring trouble on yourself.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.949
Do you want to know my idea of trouble,
Claudia?

38:16.360 --> 38:20.592
This stinking outpost,
that filthy rabble out there.

39:04.442 --> 39:07.309
Do you always punish your prisoners
before they're judged?

39:07.678 --> 39:08.440
Governor...

39:08.746 --> 39:11.306
What accusations do you bring
against this man?

39:13.117 --> 39:14.379
Well...

39:15.119 --> 39:19.055
If he weren't a malefactor, we wouldn't
have brought him before you.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.048
That's not what I asked.

39:21.659 --> 39:23.991
Why don't you judge him
according to your own laws?

39:24.328 --> 39:28.059
Consul, you know it's unlawful for us...

39:28.599 --> 39:31.830
...to condemn any man to death.

39:32.636 --> 39:33.660
To death?

39:34.205 --> 39:37.504
What has this man done
to merit such a penalty?

39:37.775 --> 39:39.538
He has violated our Sabbath, Consul.

39:42.146 --> 39:43.170
Go on...

39:43.280 --> 39:45.111
He has seduced the people...

39:45.483 --> 39:48.919
...taught foul, disgusting doctrines.

39:51.088 --> 39:54.421
Isn't he the prophet you welcomed into
Jerusalem only five days ago?

39:55.159 --> 39:56.888
And now you want him dead?

39:57.628 --> 39:59.619
Can any of you explain
this madness to me?

40:09.340 --> 40:10.807
Your Excellency, please...

40:12.676 --> 40:17.739
So far the high priest hasn't told you
this man's greatest crime.

40:18.749 --> 40:22.378
He has become the leader
of a large and dangerous sect...

40:22.753 --> 40:25.551
...who hail him as the Son of David!

40:27.024 --> 40:31.154
He claims that he is the Messiah...

40:31.629 --> 40:34.257
...the king promised to the Jews.

40:35.566 --> 40:40.526
He has forbidden his followers to pay
tribute to the emperor, Consul!

40:47.545 --> 40:49.012
Bring him here!

41:21.145 --> 41:22.043
Go!

41:28.185 --> 41:29.117
Drink.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.569
Are you the king of the Jews?

41:48.072 --> 41:50.700
Does this question come from you?

41:51.208 --> 41:56.168
Or do you ask me this because others
have told you that is what I am?

41:57.915 --> 42:00.941
Why would I ask you that?

42:01.719 --> 42:03.209
Am I a Jew?

42:03.954 --> 42:08.914
Your high priests, your own people
delivered you up to me.

42:09.593 --> 42:11.254
They want me to have you executed.

42:11.629 --> 42:13.790
Why? What have you done?

42:16.800 --> 42:18.597
Are you a king?

42:22.673 --> 42:25.471
My kingdom is not of this world.

42:25.909 --> 42:27.536
If it were...

42:27.811 --> 42:32.612
...do you think my followers
would have let them hand me over?

42:34.084 --> 42:35.483
Then you are a king?

42:38.122 --> 42:40.716
That is why I was born.

42:41.625 --> 42:44.423
To give testimony to the truth.

42:45.195 --> 42:50.155
All men who hear the truth
hear my voice.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.603
Truth!

42:57.975 --> 43:00.170
What is truth?

43:26.236 --> 43:30.195
I have questioned this prisoner,
and I find no cause in him.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.676
This man is a Galilean, is he not?

43:43.987 --> 43:44.976
He is.

43:45.389 --> 43:47.653
Then he is King Herod's subject.

43:48.692 --> 43:50.284
Let Herod judge him.

43:50.627 --> 43:51.252
Governor...

43:51.562 --> 43:52.620
Hand him over.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.015
Jesus of Nazareth!

44:18.655 --> 44:19.622
Where?

44:25.062 --> 44:26.324
Where is he?

44:33.570 --> 44:35.094
This...

44:36.640 --> 44:38.073
...is Jesus of Nazareth?

44:44.448 --> 44:47.349
Is it true that you restore sight
to the blind?

44:51.088 --> 44:52.851
Raise men from the dead?

45:09.873 --> 45:14.037
Where do you get your power?

45:20.184 --> 45:25.144
Are you the one
whose birth was foretold?

45:31.862 --> 45:33.693
Answer me!

45:34.665 --> 45:36.098
Are you a king?

45:41.271 --> 45:42.898
How about me?

45:44.942 --> 45:47.638
Will you work a little miracle for me?

46:03.994 --> 46:07.623
Take this stupid fool out of my sight.

46:08.131 --> 46:11.157
He's not guilty of a crime,
he's just crazy.

46:13.136 --> 46:16.401
Give him a fool's homage...

46:38.996 --> 46:40.827
What is truth, Claudia?

46:41.498 --> 46:46.265
Do you hear it,
recognize it when it is spoken?

46:47.037 --> 46:49.232
Yes, I do.

46:51.441 --> 46:52.669
Don't you?

46:52.976 --> 46:54.603
How?

46:55.345 --> 46:57.279
Can you tell me?

47:06.523 --> 47:11.358
If you will not hear the truth,
no one can tell you.

47:13.163 --> 47:14.926
Truth...

47:16.366 --> 47:19.597
Do you want to know what my truth is,
Claudia?

47:20.737 --> 47:25.674
I've been putting down rebellions in
this rotten outpost for eleven years.

47:26.476 --> 47:28.444
If I don't condemn this man...

47:28.812 --> 47:32.612
...I know Caiphas will start a rebellion.

47:33.417 --> 47:36.853
If I do condemn him,
then his followers may.

47:37.854 --> 47:39.651
Either way, there will be bloodshed.

47:40.190 --> 47:43.489
Caesar has warned me, Claudia.
Warned me twice.

47:44.394 --> 47:48.057
He swore that the next time
the blood would be mine.

47:48.832 --> 47:50.493
That is my truth!

47:55.405 --> 48:00.365
Herod refuses to condemn the man.
They're bringing him back here.

48:01.011 --> 48:03.536
We're going to need reinforcements.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.144
I don't want to cause an uprising.

48:07.684 --> 48:09.652
There is already an uprising.

48:35.312 --> 48:38.941
King Herod found no cause in this man.

48:41.184 --> 48:43.948
Neither do I.

48:50.160 --> 48:53.323
Men! Attend to the crowd!

49:06.176 --> 49:07.541
Quiet!

49:08.011 --> 49:11.538
Have you no respect
for our Roman procurator?

49:18.889 --> 49:23.223
As you know, every year
I release a criminal back to you.

49:24.194 --> 49:27.357
We are now holding
a notorious murderer...

49:28.432 --> 49:29.865
...Barabbas.

49:46.650 --> 49:49.847
Which of the two men would you have me
release to you?

49:50.153 --> 49:52.053
The murderer Barabbas?

49:52.322 --> 49:54.222
Or Jesus, called the Messiah?

49:54.825 --> 49:59.023
He is not the Messiah!
He is an imposter! A blasphemer!

50:00.197 --> 50:02.028
Free Barabbas!

50:18.548 --> 50:23.508
Again I ask you: Which of these two men
should I release to you?

50:24.087 --> 50:26.385
Free Barabbas!

50:42.339 --> 50:43.966
Free him.

51:18.108 --> 51:21.544
What would you have me do
with Jesus the Nazarene?

51:22.612 --> 51:24.443
Have him crucified!

51:40.197 --> 51:41.221
No!

51:41.698 --> 51:43.325
I will chastise him...

51:44.100 --> 51:45.465
...but then I will set him free.

51:50.207 --> 51:52.971
See to it that the punishment
is severe, Abenader.

51:53.543 --> 51:56.706
But don't let them kill the man.

53:18.495 --> 53:20.588
My heart is ready, Father...

53:21.164 --> 53:23.132
...my heart is ready.

57:47.096 --> 57:49.121
My son...

57:50.800 --> 57:55.260
...when, where, how...

57:57.440 --> 58:01.171
...will you choose to be delivered of this?

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:25.137
If the world hates you...

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:30.968
...remember that it has hated me first.

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:40.553
Remember also that no servant
is greater than his master.

01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:47.088
If they persecuted me,
they will persecute you.

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.828
You must not be afraid.

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:54.363
The Helper will come...

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:59.871
...who reveals the truth about God...

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:05.643
...and who comes from the Father.

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.716
Stop!

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:20.829
Enough!
Your orders were to punish this man...

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:27.034
...not to scourge him to death!

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.770
Take him away.

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.044
Get going!

01:03:48.724 --> 01:03:50.214
Get him out of here!

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.680
Your majesty...

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.915
Take care of it.

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:28.256
A beautiful rose bush.

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:35.391
Look at him... king of the worms!

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:38.659
Hail, wormy king!

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:43.432
A color fit for a king!

01:07:59.808 --> 01:08:01.833
We're here to pay our respects.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.478
A leader for our brotherhood!

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.660
Behold the man.

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:03.129
Crucify him!

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:16.682
Isn't this enough? Look at him!

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.680
Crucify him!

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.602
Shall I crucify your king?

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:39.238
We have no king but Caesar!

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.709
Speak to me.

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:47.575
I have the power to crucify you,
or else to set you free.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.822
You have no power over me...

01:09:56.525 --> 01:10:01.394
...except what is given you from above.

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:06.565
Therefore,
it is he who delivered me to you...

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:12.538
...who has the greater sin.

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:17.111
If you free him, Governor...

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:21.348
...you are no friend of Caesar's.

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:25.344
You must crucify him!

01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:00.806
It is you who want to crucify him,
not I. Look you to it.

01:12:01.579 --> 01:12:04.377
I am innocent of this man's blood.

01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:24.425
Abenader...

01:12:30.141 --> 01:12:32.666
Do as they wish.

01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:08.437
I am your servant, Father.

01:13:08.546 --> 01:13:11.174
Your servant,
and the son of Your handmaid.

01:13:12.116 --> 01:13:17.076
Why do you embrace your cross, fool?

01:13:21.158 --> 01:13:23.922
All right, your highness, let's move!

01:14:59.056 --> 01:15:01.524
Help me get near him.

01:15:04.562 --> 01:15:06.860
This way.

01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:58.712
This way, Mother.

01:16:38.022 --> 01:16:39.580
Mother...

01:17:40.784 --> 01:17:42.217
Mother...

01:18:18.188 --> 01:18:20.088
I'm here...

01:18:23.594 --> 01:18:25.562
I'm here...

01:18:35.839 --> 01:18:40.299
See, mother, I make all things new.

01:19:10.908 --> 01:19:12.205
Who is that?

01:19:12.409 --> 01:19:13.137
Who?

01:19:15.546 --> 01:19:17.036
She's the Galilean's mother.

01:19:17.748 --> 01:19:18.840
Let's go.

01:19:21.418 --> 01:19:22.350
Come on!

01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:35.349
Don't fret, my daughter.

01:20:35.759 --> 01:20:37.954
Don't fret.

01:21:08.158 --> 01:21:09.523
Are you blind?

01:21:10.527 --> 01:21:13.894
Can't you see, he can't go on?

01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:19.468
Help him!

01:21:38.722 --> 01:21:40.019
You!

01:21:40.557 --> 01:21:45.085
Yes, you! Get over here!

01:21:51.668 --> 01:21:52.657
What do you want from me?

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:56.433
This criminal can't carry his cross
by himself anymore.

01:21:56.707 --> 01:21:58.937
You will help him! Now get going!

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:03.905
I can't do that. It's none of my business.
Get someone else!

01:22:04.515 --> 01:22:06.813
Help him! He is a holy man.

01:22:07.184 --> 01:22:08.981
Do as I tell you. Now move! Let's go!

01:22:13.690 --> 01:22:16.090
All right, but remember...

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.191
...I'm an innocent man, forced to carry
the cross of a condemned man.

01:22:21.565 --> 01:22:24.033
Stay here. Wait for me.

01:24:19.983 --> 01:24:22.611
Permit me, my Lord.

01:24:52.616 --> 01:24:56.211
Who do you think you are?

01:24:56.586 --> 01:24:59.054
Get away from here.

01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:02.114
Impossible people!

01:25:11.501 --> 01:25:13.628
Someone stop this!

01:25:29.152 --> 01:25:32.747
Stop! Stop!

01:25:40.163 --> 01:25:43.155
Leave him alone!

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:55.143
If you don't stop, I won't carry
that cross one more step.

01:25:55.946 --> 01:25:58.915
I don't care what you do to me!

01:26:04.087 --> 01:26:07.056
All right, all right, let's get moving.

01:26:07.591 --> 01:26:10.389
We don't have all day. Let's go!

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.627
Let's go...

01:26:19.436 --> 01:26:21.063
...Jew!

01:28:59.029 --> 01:29:00.621
Almost there.

01:29:07.237 --> 01:29:09.262
We're nearly there.

01:29:23.887 --> 01:29:25.855
Almost done.

01:29:36.433 --> 01:29:40.733
You have heard it said...

01:29:42.339 --> 01:29:45.672
...you shall love your neighbor
and hate your enemy.

01:29:47.243 --> 01:29:49.404
But I say to you...

01:29:50.513 --> 01:29:55.473
...Iove your enemies
and pray for those who persecute you...

01:29:58.254 --> 01:30:01.485
For if you love only those who love you...

01:30:05.061 --> 01:30:07.791
...what reward is there in that?

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:06.652
I am the good shepherd.

01:31:08.058 --> 01:31:10.583
I lay down my life for my sheep.

01:31:11.327 --> 01:31:14.353
No one takes my life from me...

01:31:15.131 --> 01:31:17.099
...but I lay it down of my own accord.

01:31:17.567 --> 01:31:19.694
I have power to lay it down...

01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:23.762
...and power to take it up again.

01:31:26.342 --> 01:31:28.242
This command is from my Father.

01:32:08.618 --> 01:32:13.112
Get away now, you're free to go.
Go on! Go on!

01:32:21.264 --> 01:32:24.961
You can get up now!

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.237
Get up, your majesty.

01:33:08.044 --> 01:33:10.205
Can't you get up?

01:33:11.614 --> 01:33:13.946
We haven't got all day.

01:33:23.092 --> 01:33:24.616
Come on, move! We're ready.

01:33:24.928 --> 01:33:26.759
Get up, your highness.

01:35:11.234 --> 01:35:12.758
You are my friends.

01:35:14.704 --> 01:35:19.664
There is no greater love than for a man
to lay down his life for his friends.

01:36:18.568 --> 01:36:21.093
I cannot be with you much longer,
my friends.

01:36:21.371 --> 01:36:27.003
You cannot go where I am going.

01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:30.843
My commandment to you
after I am gone is this...

01:36:32.648 --> 01:36:34.275
Love one another.

01:36:35.218 --> 01:36:37.948
As I have loved you...

01:36:38.654 --> 01:36:42.784
...so love one another.

01:37:05.915 --> 01:37:08.543
You believe in me.

01:37:12.255 --> 01:37:14.883
You know that I am the Way...

01:37:15.758 --> 01:37:20.718
...the Truth, and the Life.

01:37:22.698 --> 01:37:27.226
And no one comes to the Father
but by me.

01:37:32.141 --> 01:37:34.268
Further out...

01:37:41.150 --> 01:37:44.608
Idiots! Let me show you how to do it.

01:37:44.987 --> 01:37:46.011
Like this!

01:38:04.574 --> 01:38:09.068
There! No, get in there.
Hold the hand open like this.

01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:12.204
Father, forgive them...

01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:03.655
Father...

01:39:04.467 --> 01:39:08.369
...Father my Father... my God...

01:39:12.141 --> 01:39:15.269
They don't know... they don't know...

01:39:19.181 --> 01:39:21.274
Stupid mongrels!

01:39:21.651 --> 01:39:25.382
Turn the wood over on its face, idiots!

01:40:53.576 --> 01:40:56.306
Take this and eat.

01:40:56.846 --> 01:41:01.249
This is my body
which is given up for you.

01:42:45.721 --> 01:42:48.019
Take this and drink.

01:42:50.392 --> 01:42:53.259
This is my blood of the new covenant...

01:42:54.396 --> 01:42:58.628
...which is given for you and for many,
for the forgiveness of sins.

01:42:59.101 --> 01:43:01.069
Do this in memory of me.

01:43:30.699 --> 01:43:35.659
If you are the son of God,
why don't you save yourself?

01:43:37.706 --> 01:43:39.674
Prove to us...

01:43:41.544 --> 01:43:44.604
...you are who you say you are.

01:44:02.965 --> 01:44:06.366
You said you could destroy the temple...

01:44:06.502 --> 01:44:08.868
...and rebuild it in three days...

01:44:09.772 --> 01:44:13.674
...and yet you cannot come down
from that cross.

01:44:13.876 --> 01:44:16.401
If he is the Messiah...

01:44:17.746 --> 01:44:22.183
...I say let him come down
from the cross...

01:44:23.452 --> 01:44:25.977
...so that we may see and believe.

01:44:35.531 --> 01:44:38.591
Father, forgive them...

01:44:41.003 --> 01:44:45.064
...they know not what they do.

01:44:49.812 --> 01:44:51.780
Listen...

01:44:53.148 --> 01:44:56.345
...he prays for you.

01:45:11.233 --> 01:45:13.861
We deserve this, Gesmas...

01:45:15.004 --> 01:45:16.995
...but he does not.

01:45:19.341 --> 01:45:20.865
I have sinned...

01:45:22.244 --> 01:45:26.078
...and my punishment is just.

01:45:27.216 --> 01:45:31.175
You would be justified in condemning me.

01:45:32.588 --> 01:45:37.491
I ask only that you remember me, Lord...

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:41.557
...when you enter your kingdom.

01:45:43.532 --> 01:45:45.329
Amen, I tell you...

01:45:48.537 --> 01:45:51.165
...on this day you shall be with me...

01:45:54.209 --> 01:45:55.836
...in paradise.

01:49:10.372 --> 01:49:12.237
I thirst.

01:49:47.476 --> 01:49:49.944
Flesh of my flesh...

01:49:52.447 --> 01:49:55.439
...heart of my heart...

01:49:57.186 --> 01:50:02.146
My son, let me die with you.

01:50:05.727 --> 01:50:07.422
Woman...

01:50:08.730 --> 01:50:12.166
...behold your son.

01:50:19.408 --> 01:50:21.638
Son, behold...

01:50:27.115 --> 01:50:29.049
...your mother.

01:50:39.127 --> 01:50:42.096
There is no one left.

01:50:43.265 --> 01:50:48.134
No one, Jesus!

01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.838
My God...

01:51:14.563 --> 01:51:18.522
...why have you forsaken me?

01:51:37.219 --> 01:51:39.983
It is accomplished.

01:52:02.144 --> 01:52:05.773
Father, into your hands...

01:52:06.815 --> 01:52:11.047
...I commend... my spirit.

01:54:03.799 --> 01:54:05.858
Cassius! Hurry!

01:54:06.435 --> 01:54:07.868
He's dead!

01:54:09.638 --> 01:54:11.105
Make sure!
