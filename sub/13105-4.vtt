WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:05.088
IS THIS ENOUGH?

00:05.130 --> 00:07.234
UH, COUPLE MORE.
JUST TO BE SAFE.
REALLY?

00:07.270 --> 00:09.238
OKAY. WE'RE GONNA
NEED A BIGGER BOAT.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.362
(Dov)
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.537
(Traci) IT'LL WORK.
IT'LL WORK.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.730
WHERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS?

00:14.780 --> 00:15.769
I THINK I THREW 'EM OUT.

00:15.810 --> 00:18.472
NOT GONNA WORK.

00:18.510 --> 00:20.171
(Serena Ryder's "Stompa"
Playing)

00:20.220 --> 00:21.676
(Andy) NO.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.813
ONE BAG, GAIL.
THAT'S THE RULES.

00:23.850 --> 00:26.717
I'VE NEVER BEEN CAMPING BEFORE.
I PLEAD IGNORANCE.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.318
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?
HEY.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.089
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA
SPEND THE LONG WEEKEND

00:30.130 --> 00:33.224
IN MY BIG COMFY BED?
I'LL PUT THE SILK SHEETS ON.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.490
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS
FOR ME.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.418
I'LL PUT THIS STUFF
IN MY RUCKSACK.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.596
I GOT LOADS OF ROOM.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.097
OH, ANOTHER BENEFIT
TO HAVING A BOYFRIEND

00:40.140 --> 00:41.459
WHO'S USED
TO SLEEPING IN THE SAND.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.706
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S A LOT

00:42.740 --> 00:44.765
OF SMALL, FERTILE VALLEYS
IN AFGHANISTAN--

00:44.810 --> 00:48.507
JAR.

00:51.410 --> 00:53.378
HEY.
HEY, GUYS.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.648
SORRY I'M LATE.
I'LL, UH, START LOADING UP.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.647
UH...
(keys jangle)

00:55.680 --> 00:56.840
EVERYTHING OKAY?

00:56.890 --> 01:00.189
WHOA, WHOA.
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE NOT COMING.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.812
DENISE HAS BEEN HOME
WITH CHRISTIAN ALL WEEK.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.623
SO BRING HIM.
TRACI'S BRINGING LEO.

01:03.660 --> 01:06.629
IT'S JUST THAT...
CHRISTIAN IS ALLERGIC TO BEES

01:06.660 --> 01:10.369
AND TREES AND POLLEN
AND GRASS AND...

01:10.400 --> 01:11.594
THIS IS THE LAST CHANCE FOR US
ALL TO GET TOGETHER

01:11.630 --> 01:14.690
BEFORE YOU GO TO TIMMINS.
WELL, I...
LOOK, I'M SO SORRY.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.628
LOOK, YOU GUYS CAN STILL
USE MY TRUCK, THOUGH.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.228
(whispers) THANK YOU.

01:18.270 --> 01:19.806
IT'S OKAY.
WE DON'T NEED IT.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.330
NO, WE REALLY DO.
(door closes)

01:21.380 --> 01:23.143
CALL THE POLICE.
I CAUGHT A STALKER.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.807
THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.

01:24.850 --> 01:26.169
HOWDY.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.744
HEY.

HEY, CAN YOU HELP ME, PLEASE?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.711
I MAKE AMAZING S'MORES.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.784

01:34.820 --> 01:37.653
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.
I DID.

01:37.690 --> 01:40.295
WE'LL... WAIT OUTSIDE.

01:40.330 --> 01:41.752
**

01:41.800 --> 01:43.199
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS
GOING CAMPING?

01:43.230 --> 01:45.425
YOU CAN'T COME.
IT'S TRADITION.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.358
* STOMPA YOUR FEET

01:47.400 --> 01:48.890
OKAY.
WHOA, THAT'S IT?

01:48.940 --> 01:51.204
NO, UH, RESISTANCE?

01:51.240 --> 01:52.207
NO.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.848
BUT I HOPE YOUR SLEEPING BAG
IS WARM, 'CAUSE...

01:56.880 --> 02:00.919
MY GUESS IS THOSE GIRLS
ARE NOT BIG CUDDLERS.

02:00.950 --> 02:02.417
ME, ON THE OTHER HAND?

02:02.450 --> 02:06.284
I, UH, GIVE OFF
A LOT OF HEAT, SO...

02:06.320 --> 02:08.311
* STOMPA YOUR FEET
* WHOA-OH-OH

02:08.360 --> 02:11.557
(police radio chatter,
siren wailing)

02:11.590 --> 02:13.319
* STOMPA YOUR FEET

02:13.360 --> 02:15.499
I CAN'T DO IT. NO.
I CAN'T--I CAN'T DO IT.

02:15.530 --> 02:16.758
FOUR DAYS ALONE
IN A TENT WITH HER--

02:16.800 --> 02:18.392
NOBODY HAS THAT MUCH
SELF-CONTROL.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.692
I... I CAN'T DO IT.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.890
EXCEPT MAYBE GANDHI.

02:21.940 --> 02:23.407
THE DALAI LAMA.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.567
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.430
AND YOU, CANCELING
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.902
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.
CAN'T WE JUST GO TO A STORE,

02:28.940 --> 02:31.170
PICK UP
SOME ALLERGY MEDICATION,

02:31.210 --> 02:34.873
AND GIVE IT TO CHRISTIAN?
HE'S ALLERGIC TO THOSE, TOO.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.547
IS THERE ANYTHING
HE'S NOT ALLERGIC TO?

02:36.590 --> 02:40.686
UH... CATS.

02:40.720 --> 02:41.687
OH! PERFECT.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.518
YOU CAN SPEND THE WEEKEND
ON A CAT SANCTUARY.

02:44.560 --> 02:45.652
WHAT, IS THAT ACTUALLY
A THING?

02:45.690 --> 02:47.351
'CAUSE CHRISTIAN
WOULD TOTALLY LOVE THAT.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.731
**

02:53.770 --> 02:55.260
I DON'T LIKE CHLOE.
WHAT?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.904
OH, COME ON.
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.669
(mouth full) NO.
CHLOE DRIVES ME CRAZY.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.769
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.346
ACTUALLY, I DO KNOW WHY.
(laughs)

03:02.380 --> 03:03.870
EVERYTHING SHE THINKS,
SHE FEELS,

03:03.910 --> 03:06.947
IT JUST KINDA COMES FLYING
OUT OF HER. IT'S TOTALLY...

03:06.980 --> 03:08.709
CHARMING.
OBNOXIOUS.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.843
AND IT BRINGS OUT
THE MEAN GIRL IN ME.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.552
EVERYBODY BRINGS OUT
THE MEAN GIRL IN YOU.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.650
(siren whoops,
car doors close)

03:16.690 --> 03:17.782
(brakes squeal)

03:17.830 --> 03:21.288
OH. THAT'S... REALLY
CRAPPY TIMING.

03:21.330 --> 03:23.890
IT'S GONNA GET EASIER,
RIGHT?

03:23.930 --> 03:26.797
(siren whooping)
THANK YOU.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.968
(indistinct conversations)

03:30.010 --> 03:33.400
HEY. WELCOME BACK.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.704
(Frank)
ALL RIGHT. HERE WE ARE.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.674
ANOTHER LONG WEEKEND.

03:37.710 --> 03:39.814
PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT OF TOWN
TO PARTY AT THE COTTAGE.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.442
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.311
SPOT CHECKS.
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:43.350 --> 03:45.716
WE'RE CHECKING FOR D.U.I.s,
SEAT BELTS, BUSTED TAILLIGHTS.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.286
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.856
AS A BONUS,

03:48.890 --> 03:50.926
YOU CAN HELP DETECTIVE SWAREK

03:50.960 --> 03:52.518
WITH LAST NIGHT'S SHOOTING.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.494
(exhales deeply) 16 YEARS OLD.

03:54.530 --> 03:55.519
RICARDO SANCHEZ.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.266
TRACK STORE OVER AT RIVINGTON.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.495
LAST NIGHT, HE GOT A BULLET
IN THE NECK

03:59.540 --> 04:00.529
AT THE SKATE PARK ON RIVER.

04:00.570 --> 04:03.562
PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE.
WAS IT A GANG HIT?

04:03.610 --> 04:05.805
SANCHEZ HAS NO PRIORS,
NO AFFILIATIONS WE KNOW OF,

04:05.840 --> 04:07.273
AND HE'S NOT ON
DRUG SQUAD'S RADAR.

04:07.310 --> 04:10.040
IT'S ENTIRELY PROBABLE
HE WAS JUST A GOOD KID

04:10.080 --> 04:11.843
IN THE WRONG PLACE.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.438
TRAFFIC CAMERAS PICKED UP
THIS CAR,

04:13.480 --> 04:14.742
PULLING INTO THE PARKING LOT

04:14.780 --> 04:16.680
JUST BEFORE THE SHOTS
WERE FIRED.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.883
UH, WE GOT NO PLATES,
BUT WE KNOW IT'S AN RX-8,

04:19.920 --> 04:22.559
RED WITH A BLACK HOOD,
AFTER-MARKET SPOILER.

04:22.590 --> 04:23.750
WE FIND THIS CAR,

04:23.790 --> 04:25.621
WE MIGHT FIND OUR SHOOTER.

04:25.660 --> 04:28.493
NO OFFENSE, SIRS, BUT THIS SEEMS
LIKE KINDA A LONG SHOT.

04:28.530 --> 04:29.667
WELL, PRICE,
THAT'S 'CAUSE IT IS,

04:29.700 --> 04:31.691
BUT RIGHT NOW
IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.799
OKAY.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.831
ALL RIGHT, CAR ASSIGNMENTS
ARE ON THE BOARD. LET'S GO.

04:34.870 --> 04:35.939
UH, SIR?

04:37.840 --> 04:38.864
EPSTEIN.

04:38.910 --> 04:40.707
OFFICER CRUZ IS BACK
ON DUTY.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.674
AND?

04:42.710 --> 04:44.371
THE SHOOTING WAS
ONLY TWO WEEKS AGO.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.469
SHE SAYS SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S GOOD.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.839
(tone rings over P.A.)

04:47.880 --> 04:49.347
EPSTEIN?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.608
BOOKING. LET'S GO.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.418
(chair wheels rattle)

04:55.460 --> 04:57.382
PARTNERS TODAY?

04:57.430 --> 04:59.921
BOOYAH!

04:59.960 --> 05:01.427
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT ME DRIVING TODAY?

05:01.460 --> 05:02.927
NO.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.392
(mouths words)

05:04.430 --> 05:05.920
(laughs)

05:05.970 --> 05:07.961
OH! SORRY. SORRY.
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.969
THAT'S A NICE SHIRT.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.671
LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.
OH.

REALLY GREAT JEANS,

05:16.080 --> 05:18.071
OH. (chuckles) THANKS.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.613
HAVE A GOOD SHIFT.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:20.650 --> 05:22.345
YEAH, LET'S--WE SHOULD GO.
LET'S GO.
YEAH.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.618
WE SHOULD...
I MEANT, THANK YOU.

05:23.650 --> 05:24.878
I REALLY CAN'T WAIT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.809
JUST TEN MORE HOURS,
AND WE'LL BE POPPING TENTS...
MM-HMM.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.487
AND WE'LL BE
SLEEPING UNDER THE STARS.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.883
BEING MAULED TO DEATH
BY BEARS.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.558
(beeping)

05:36.600 --> 05:37.794
(door buzzes in distance,
telephone ringing)

05:37.830 --> 05:39.491
PRETTY SWEET NEW SYSTEM.
(beep)

05:39.540 --> 05:41.098
I MEAN, I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING CERTIFIED ON IT.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.095
(beep)

05:42.140 --> 05:43.960
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.637
I'D RATHER BE ON PATROL
THAN DOING THIS.

05:45.670 --> 05:46.739
WELL, YEAH, OF COURSE.
ME, TOO.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.702
BUT AT LEAST THIS WAY,
WE BEAT THE HEAT.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.571
I'M TELLING YA,
IT'S DISGUSTING OUT THERE.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.578
FEELS LIKE SOMEONE'S GOT
A WET TOWEL ON YOUR FACE.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.679
(beep)

05:54.720 --> 05:55.470
(beep)

05:55.520 --> 05:57.010
YOU READ ANY GOOD BOOKS
LATELY?

05:57.050 --> 05:58.039
(sighs) STOP IT.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.149
HEY, I'M JUST MAKING
SMALL TALK.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.579
(indistinct conversations)

06:02.630 --> 06:03.983
(crushes can)

06:04.030 --> 06:05.429
(can clatters)

06:08.130 --> 06:10.519
DIAZ AND I ARE GONNA BE
FIRST CONTACT.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.834
WE'RE GONNA DIRECT
ALL THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

06:12.870 --> 06:15.088
NEXT IS COLLINS AND PRICE,
AND IF THERE'S ANY OVERFLOW,

06:15.140 --> 06:16.903

06:16.940 --> 06:20.478
NOW LISTEN, GUYS, IF ANYBODY
SEES DETECTIVE SWAREK'S RX-8,

06:20.510 --> 06:22.102
YOU CALL IT IN, OKAY?

06:22.140 --> 06:23.072
ALL RIGHT, WE ALL HAVE PLANS
THIS WEEKEND,

06:23.110 --> 06:25.840
AND THOSE PLANS
DO NOT INVOLVE GETTING SHOT.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.514
SO... YOU KNOW.

06:30.550 --> 06:31.710
1-5, GO, TEAM.

06:31.750 --> 06:35.083

06:35.120 --> 06:37.020
OH, AND GET 'EM TO TO TAKE
THEIR LICENSE OUT

06:37.060 --> 06:38.027
AND HAND IT TO YOU.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.425
GIVES YOU A CHANCE
TO CHECK THEIR COORDINATION,

06:39.460 --> 06:40.950
SEE IF THEIR HANDS
ARE SHAKING.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.094
STEALTHY. I LIKE IT.
I LIKE IT.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.530
HEY, UM...

06:46.570 --> 06:48.936
THANKS FOR SHOWING ME
THE ROPES, YOU KNOW?

06:48.970 --> 06:52.007
NOT TREATING ME
WITH A LEOPARD.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.008
I THINK YOU MEAN LEPER.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.576
(radio chatter)

06:55.610 --> 06:58.044
LIKE SOMEONE WITH LEPROSY.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.447
DISEASE. CAUSES DISFIGUREMENT,
LESIONS.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.040
EW. NO, I-I MEAN,
A LEOPARD.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.580
YOU KNOW, LIKE--
LIKE A BIG JUNGLE CAT

07:05.620 --> 07:08.453
THAT PEOPLE TRY TO AVOID

07:08.490 --> 07:09.525
AH.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.495
WELL, THEN, YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:12.530 --> 07:14.657

continues)

07:14.700 --> 07:18.067

OH, JUST LIKE

07:50.300 --> 07:52.120
I'M GONNA GET YOU TO TAKE
THE KEYS OUT OF THE IGNITION.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.068
STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE.

07:53.100 --> 07:57.264
OH. OH, MY GOD.

07:59.110 --> 08:00.737
OH, THAT'S FINE.
IT'S THIS WAY.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.179

08:12.890 --> 08:14.255
WHERE YOU COMING FROM?

08:14.290 --> 08:17.020

08:17.060 --> 08:18.527
AND WHERE'S THAT?

08:18.560 --> 08:19.788
(police radio chatter)

08:19.830 --> 08:21.991
(breathing heavily)

08:22.030 --> 08:25.625
CAN I SEE YOUR LICENSE
AND REG--

08:25.670 --> 08:30.869
(tires peal)
15-09. WE'RE IN A PURSUIT
OF A GOLD SEDAN, UH...

08:30.910 --> 08:32.002
EAST ON WILSON.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.769
(tires screech)

08:33.810 --> 08:36.847
(siren wailing)

08:43.050 --> 08:46.884
(tires screech, gravel crunches)

08:46.920 --> 08:49.081
(engine turns off)

08:49.120 --> 08:52.055
(police radio chatter)

08:53.760 --> 08:54.988
I DON'T SEE HIM.

08:55.030 --> 08:57.294
15-09. WE LOST HIM.
(static crackles)

08:57.330 --> 09:00.037
EINSTEIN THOUGHT HE COULD
DRIVE THROUGH THE GATE.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.008
ANYTHING IN THE TRUNK?
(trunk creaks)

09:05.040 --> 09:08.203
UH... NOPE.
JUST A TEENAGE BOY.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.639
WHAT?

09:13.150 --> 09:14.219
HEY.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.187
OFFICERS,
IT WAS JUST A PRANK.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.084
MY FRIEND WAS JUST
MESSING AROUND.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.929
SO HE PUT YOU IN THE TRUNK
OF HIS CAR?

09:23.960 --> 09:25.086
(sighs) LOOK, OKAY,
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.792
MY NAME IS ALEX.
2 PLUS 2 EQUALS 4.

09:27.830 --> 09:29.718
GO AHEAD. ASK ANYTHING.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.226
DOES YOUR FRIEND HAVE A NAME?

09:31.270 --> 09:33.238
I DON'T REMEMBER.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

09:33.270 --> 09:34.498
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOUR LITTLE B.F.F.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.202
BLEW THROUGH OUR TRAFFIC STOP
AND ALMOST RAN OVER MY PARTNER.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.003
SO... WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
INTO THE STATION

09:39.040 --> 09:40.075
UNTIL YOU DO REMEMBER.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.840
(radio chatter)

09:42.880 --> 09:43.699
WE'RE GONNA CALL
YOUR PARENTS

09:43.750 --> 09:45.741
AS SOON AS WE GET BACK
TO THE STATION.

09:45.780 --> 09:48.749
I DON'T HAVE PARENTS.
I'M AN ORPHAN, LIKE BATMAN.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.338
LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL US ANYTHING,

09:50.390 --> 09:51.982
WE CAN'T HELP YOU.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.181
OH, JEEZ.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.756
WHAT'S WRONG?

09:55.790 --> 09:57.621
UH, NOTHING.
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.082
I JUST...

09:59.130 --> 10:01.155
UH, GAIL,
HIS NOSE IS BLEEDING.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.155
WE GOTTA GET HIM
TO A HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.623
UH, NO. NO, I'M GOOD. PLEASE.
(clicks switch)

10:04.670 --> 10:07.298
(siren wailing)
YOU'RE NOT DROPPING DEAD
IN THE BACK OF MY SQUAD CAR.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.262
(sighs)

10:09.300 --> 10:11.860
THIS IS NICE. HMM?

10:11.910 --> 10:13.798
WE'RE TRYING TO GET YOUR LAWYER
ON THE PHONE, SO JUST SIT TIGHT.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.001
OKAY, WELL,
WOULD YOU MIND VERY MUCH

10:16.040 --> 10:18.873
IF I JUST SORT OF PUT
MY FEET UP OVER HERE?

10:18.910 --> 10:21.174
FILL YOUR BOOTS.
OKAY, THANK YOU.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.314
(receiver clatters)
NO LUCK WITH THE LAWYER.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.215
HE MIGHT HAVE STARTED
HIS WEEKEND EARLY.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.285
THEN SHE'S SCREWED.
(chair wheels roll)

10:30.330 --> 10:32.992
(tone rings over P.A.,
man speaking indistinctly)

10:33.030 --> 10:34.793
HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING?

10:36.460 --> 10:37.666
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DRINK

10:37.700 --> 10:39.065
MORE THAN TWO OF THOSE
A DAY.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.706
WHAT, ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
NO, BUT IT'S WRITTEN
ON THE SIDE OF THE CAN.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.833
YEAH, WELL, WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT CAN HAPPEN?

10:44.870 --> 10:47.031
OH. OSTEOPOROSIS,
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.277
ULCERS, HEART DISEASE,
EARLY ONSET DIABETES.

10:50.310 --> 10:52.403
(can clatters)

10:52.450 --> 10:53.417
LOOK...

10:53.450 --> 10:55.338
I WAS IN THE EXACT SAME
SITUATION A YEAR AGO.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.144
I COULDN'T SLEEP.
I HAD ZERO APPETITE.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.954
(sighs) I ATE A CHEESEBURGER
FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.150
CAN WE JUST WORK?

11:02.190 --> 11:05.125
PLEASE? (clears throat)

11:05.160 --> 11:08.197
YOU BET.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.061
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.067
I'M KIND OF A BLEEDER.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.295
WELL, YOU MUST REALLY KILL IT
WITH THE LADIES.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.898
NOT REALLY.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.931
WHAT, YOU DON'T HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND?

11:16.970 --> 11:18.437
I USED TO HAVE ONE.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.437
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:19.470 --> 11:21.233
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.941
EVERYTHING WAS GOING SO GREAT,

11:22.980 --> 11:25.301
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT WAS OVER.

11:25.350 --> 11:26.476
YEAH, THAT HAPPENS
SOMETIMES.

11:26.510 --> 11:27.613
WELL, IT SHOULDN'T.

11:27.650 --> 11:30.084
WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU LOVE,
IT SHOULD BE FOREVER,

11:30.120 --> 11:32.008
NO MATTER WHAT.
I AGREE.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.085
(elevator bell dings)

11:33.120 --> 11:34.951
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
TO GET A ROOM AROUND HERE?

11:34.990 --> 11:37.151
OH, UH...

11:37.190 --> 11:38.782
ANDY, I DON'T THINK
IT'S YOUR DAY,

11:38.830 --> 11:40.195
'CAUSE THAT IS
SAM'S EX-GIRLFRIEND.

11:40.230 --> 11:44.166
WHAT? OH, COME ON.
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.361
ANDY.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.836
HEY, MONICA.
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:49.870 --> 11:51.735
WE'RE JUST PREPPING
AN EXAMINATION ROOM

11:51.770 --> 11:53.032
FOR YOUR FRIEND HERE.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.776
AWESOME. THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU. TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:55.810 --> 11:57.300
HOW'S SAM?

11:57.350 --> 12:00.046
SAM'S GOOD. UM...

12:00.080 --> 12:01.445
HE JUST MADE DETECTIVE.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.811
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNEW THAT.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.239
YOU GOT SAM SWAREK
INTO A SUIT, HUH?

12:05.290 --> 12:06.518
NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE THE DAY.

12:06.550 --> 12:07.949
WELL, YEAH, IT'S JUST MORE

12:07.990 --> 12:09.014
OF LIKE A DRESS SHIRT
AND JEANS COMBO,

12:09.060 --> 12:10.357
BUT WE BROKE UP,

12:10.390 --> 12:12.119
SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE A SAY
ON HIS CLOTHES ANYMORE.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.527
OH. SORRY. I...
I DIDN'T KNOW.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.893
THAT'S OKAY. NO, WE'RE REALLY
GOOD FRIENDS STILL.

12:18.930 --> 12:20.795
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.262
OKAY. UM...

12:22.300 --> 12:24.063
WELL, HIS ROOM SHOULD BE
READY BY NOW.

12:24.110 --> 12:25.168
THAT'S SUPER.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.906

12:27.940 --> 12:29.339

12:29.380 --> 12:30.904

over P.A.)

12:30.950 --> 12:32.247
OH, UH, HEY, YOU KNOW,

12:32.280 --> 12:35.078
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE

12:35.120 --> 12:37.042
UH, I WOULDN'T WANNA HANG OUT
WITH MY EX'S EX

12:37.090 --> 12:39.342

THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER,

12:40.590 --> 12:42.217

12:51.070 --> 12:52.389

12:52.430 --> 12:54.330
THANKS, OFFICER.

12:54.370 --> 12:56.565

12:56.600 --> 12:58.909

12:58.940 --> 13:00.168

13:00.210 --> 13:01.472

13:27.440 --> 13:29.067

13:29.100 --> 13:30.169
WE CAN FIRE UP THE 'CUE,

13:30.210 --> 13:32.462
MAYBE HEAD DOWN

13:32.510 --> 13:34.478

GONNA HAPPEN, DIAZ.

13:34.510 --> 13:36.842
(chuckles) FIRST TIME

13:36.880 --> 13:38.370
IT'LL BE THE LAST, MAN.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.517

13:46.190 --> 13:49.409
OH, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.189
RED CAR, BLACK HOOD.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.323

SWAREK'S SUSPECT.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.055
(static crackles)
COLLINS, GET PRICE

13:55.100 --> 13:56.397

(static crackles)

13:56.430 --> 13:59.069
DIAZ, YOU'RE GONNA STAY
VERY CLOSE TO ME.

13:59.100 --> 14:02.467
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP YOUR EYES

ON THE GROUND NOW.
HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

14:40.310 --> 14:42.232
WHY DON'T YOU TRY ASKING
POLITELY NEXT TIME?

14:42.280 --> 14:44.009
HEY.

14:54.960 --> 14:55.915
LET'S GO.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.552
(Chloe) DISPATCH, THIS IS 15-03.

14:57.590 --> 15:00.559
(Alex speaking indistinctly)

15:00.600 --> 15:01.726
GET AWAY FROM HIM.

15:01.760 --> 15:04.069
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
HEY, HEY! HEY, HEY!
(clattering)

15:04.100 --> 15:06.295
ALEX. WHAT'S_ GOING ON?
(panUng)

15:06.330 --> 15:08.139
I DON'T WANT HER TO TOUCH ME.
I'M NOT TAKING OFF MY CLOTHES!

15:08.170 --> 15:10.035
OKAY. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.037
CALM DOWN.

15:11.070 --> 15:13.106
(continues panting)

15:13.140 --> 15:15.506
COME ON. JUST GO SIT DOWN.

15:20.050 --> 15:23.281
ALEX WAS IN THE BATHROOM,
CHANGING.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.309
IT WAS TAKING A LONG TIME,

15:24.350 --> 15:27.148
SO I KNOCKED
AND OPENED THE DOOR.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.454
ALEX IS A GIRL.

15:29.490 --> 15:32.152
GUESS SHE DIDN'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.058
(police radio chatter)

15:41.470 --> 15:43.734
YOUTH SERVICES
WILL BE HERE SOON.

15:43.770 --> 15:45.965
(police radio chatter)
YOU MUST BE ALEX.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.137
HI. I'M DETECTIVE NASH.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.740
SO THE NURSE TELLS ME
THAT YOU HAVE A CONCUSSION...

15:50.780 --> 15:52.668
(clicks pen)
THAT YOU GOT YOUR HEAD
BANGED UP TODAY.

15:52.710 --> 15:53.745
YOU WANNA TELL ME
HOW THAT HAPPENED?

15:53.780 --> 15:55.111
NOT REALLY.

15:55.150 --> 15:57.186
DID SOMEONE HURT YOU?

15:57.220 --> 15:59.438
(chuckles)

15:59.490 --> 16:02.118
(inhales deeply)
I'M FROM A CRAPPY LITTLE TOWN

16:02.160 --> 16:03.525
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF,

16:03.560 --> 16:08.293
AND TODAY MY PARENTS JUST
KICKED ME OUT OF OUR HOUSE.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.093
(sighs)

16:10.130 --> 16:11.461
MY HAIR,
THE--THE WAY I DRESS--

16:11.500 --> 16:13.365
THEY THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A PHASE,

16:13.400 --> 16:15.231
BUT IT'S NOT.

16:15.270 --> 16:17.238
THEY COULDN'T HANDLE
THE TRUTH.

16:17.270 --> 16:21.206
JUST MADE IT ABOUT WHAT
EVERYONE ELSE WAS GONNA SAY.

16:21.240 --> 16:24.243
AND SO YOU LEFT
AND CAME HERE.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.078
THAT GIRL I TOLD YOU
ABOUT...

16:27.120 --> 16:29.008
SHE LIVES HERE.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.742
WELL,
WHO WAS DRIVING THE CAR?

16:32.790 --> 16:35.111
HER BROTHER.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.754
(inhales deeply) HE CAME HOME.
HE... SAW US TOGETHER,

16:37.790 --> 16:39.758
AND HE JUST FLIPPED OUT.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.318
AND SHE WAS MY ONLY FRIEND.

16:44.370 --> 16:48.329
WELL, THE SOCIAL WORKER
WILL BE HERE SOON.

16:48.370 --> 16:50.429
SHE'LL HELP US
FIGURE THIS OUT.

16:50.470 --> 16:53.200
MY HEAD HURTS.
CAN YOU CALL A NURSE?

16:53.240 --> 16:54.571
OF COURSE.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.771
COME CHECK ON YOU IN A BIT.

16:56.810 --> 16:58.778
(door opens)

17:04.690 --> 17:06.612
SO ALEX HAS BEEN DEALT
SOME PRETTY BAD LUCK.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.685
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO
ABOUT THAT.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.585
BUT WE CAN TRACK DOWN
THE SON OF A BITCH

17:09.620 --> 17:11.520
WHO STUFFED HIM
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.324
PLATES ARE REGISTERED
TO A HOUSE IN ETOBICOKE.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.726
GO CHECK IT OUT. I WILL WAIT
FOR THE SOCIAL WORKER.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.068
OKAY.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.095
OUR GUY IS CESAR MEDINA.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.209
HE ACTUALLY GREW UP
AROUND HERE,

17:23.240 --> 17:25.765
BUT HIS CAR'S REGISTERED
TO AN ADDRESS IN MONTREAL.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.573
WOW, THAT'S A DECENT
RAP SHEET.

17:27.610 --> 17:29.475
AFFILIATION
WITH LOS VIBORAS.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.705
NASTY CREW.
YEAH.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.571
ALL RIGHT. FORENSICS IS
FINISHED WITH THE CAR.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.111
NO SIGN OF A GUN,
BUT GUNSHOT TRAUMA WAS FOUND.

17:37.150 --> 17:38.139
THREE SEPARATE SHOTS
TO THE VEHICLE.

17:38.190 --> 17:41.159
AND WE ONLY FOUND
FOUR CASINGS ON SCENE, RIGHT?

17:41.190 --> 17:44.079
YEAH. ONE IN THE KID,
THREE IN THE CAR.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.553
HE TOOK FIRE,
BUT HE NEVER SHOT BACK.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.719
(door buzzes and beeps)

17:49.760 --> 17:51.864
HEY, CESAR.
I'M DETECTIVE SWAREK,

17:51.900 --> 17:54.789
AND, UH, I WOULD LIKE
TO BE YOUR FRIEND HERE.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.365
PFFI'.
BRO, DOES THAT EVER WORK?

17:57.410 --> 18:00.379
NOT VERY OFTEN, WHICH IS
A SHAME, BECAUSE, UH,

18:00.410 --> 18:01.502
YOU COULD USE A FRIEND
RIGHT NOW.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.371
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

18:03.410 --> 18:04.843
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO BE MY FRIEND.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.839
HIS NAME WAS
RICARDO SANCHEZ.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.583
TOOK A BULLET
IN THE NECK LAST NIGHT.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.350
(photos rustling)

18:15.390 --> 18:16.652
I'D LOVE TO KNOW
WHO SHOT HIM.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.491
THIS KID'S FAMILY'S GRIEVING,
CESAR.

18:26.530 --> 18:27.895
THEY NEED ANSWERS.

18:27.940 --> 18:28.895
I AM HIS FAMILY.
WHAT?

18:28.940 --> 18:30.498
I AM HIS FAMILY.

18:32.340 --> 18:35.207
RICHIE'S MY BABY COUSIN.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.276
AND NOW HE'S DEAD
BECAUSE OF A BULLET

18:37.310 --> 18:38.709
THAT WAS MEANT FOR YOU?

18:38.750 --> 18:41.548
DETECTIVE...

18:44.890 --> 18:46.517
EITHER WAY YOU LOOK AT IT,

18:46.550 --> 18:47.858
I GOT NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.882
(Chris) HE KNOWS WHO DID IT.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.420
I THINK HE'S TOO SCARED
TO TALK.

18:52.460 --> 18:53.757
I'M GUESSING
HE DOESN'T WANNA TELL US

18:53.800 --> 18:56.291
'CAUSE HE'S PLANNING
TO CLEAN UP HIS OWN MESS.

18:56.330 --> 18:57.592
I DON'T KNOW. BACKGROUND
ON CESAR MEDINA CHECKS OUT.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.359
MOVED FROM MONTREAL
TWO YEARS AGO,

18:59.400 --> 19:00.799
GOT A JOB,
WENT BACK TO SCHOOL.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.229
AND HE'S BEEN CLEAN
SINCE HE'S BEEN THERE.

19:03.270 --> 19:06.307
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
THAT WAS GUNS AND GANGS.

19:06.340 --> 19:07.602
TURNS OUT, ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO,

19:07.640 --> 19:10.768
VIBORAS ACTUALLY HAD A BEEF
WITH THE JAMESON BOYS.

19:10.810 --> 19:12.402
WHAT STARTED
AS A CLUB INCIDENT

19:12.450 --> 19:13.872
TURNED INTO A TURF THING.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.512
AND CESAR WAS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT?

19:15.550 --> 19:18.849
CESAR AND A GUY NAMED, UH--
JAMESON GUY NAMED SHAY BISHOP.

19:18.890 --> 19:20.710
UH... SHAY BISHOP.
SHAY BISHOP, HUH?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.409
YEAH, HE'S BEEN A HOUSEGUEST
OF OURS A FEW TIMES.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.688
SHOULDN'T BE HARD
TO GET AN ADDRESS ON HIM.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.425
RIGHT. OKAY.
YOU AND DIAZ TRACK HIM DOWN.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.951
COLLINS, PRICE, SEE IF YOU CAN
FIND A MORE RECENT CONNECTION

19:28.000 --> 19:29.797
BETWEEN CESAR AND BISHOP.

19:29.830 --> 19:30.797
ABSOLUTELY.
SURE.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.320
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

19:32.370 --> 19:33.632
I'M GONNA TALK
TO THE VICTIM'S MOM,

19:33.670 --> 19:36.935
SHE WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY
ABOUT HER NEPHEW CESAR.

19:36.970 --> 19:40.770
OKAY, SHAY BISHOP.
UH, TWO COUNTS OF POSSESSION.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.971
OOH, AND A COUNT
OF AG ASSAULT,

19:43.010 --> 19:45.672
BECAUSE HE BROKE A GUY'S JAW
WITH A BRICK.

19:45.710 --> 19:46.847
(radio chatter)

19:46.880 --> 19:49.314
NONE OF THIS STUFF HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH CESAR MEDINA.

19:49.350 --> 19:50.647
JUST KEEP LOOKING.

19:50.690 --> 19:55.855
SO, UH...
GOT ANY SCOOP ON DOV?

19:55.890 --> 19:59.428
COME ON. DON'T BE ALL LIKE
"BRO CODE" ABOUT IT.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.928
DOV AND THOSE OTHER GUYS
ARE A LOT CLOSER

20:01.960 --> 20:03.996
'CAUSE THEY ALL CAME UP
TOGETHER.

20:04.030 --> 20:05.895
I'M NOT REALLY PART
OF THE INNER SANCTUM.
(computer beeps)

20:05.930 --> 20:10.401
BUT... YOU WENT UNDERCOVER
WITH ANDY FOR, LIKE, SIX MONTHS.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.862
(tone rings over P.A.,
man Speaking indistinctly)

20:11.910 --> 20:14.708
YOU GUYS
WENT ALL U.C. NINJA.

20:14.740 --> 20:16.571
(lowered voice) YOU HELPED
CRACK A METH RING.

20:16.610 --> 20:21.479
(sighs) FINE.
BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AMAZING.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.544
IT WAS.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.389
OKAY, SO GIVE ME THE SCOOP.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.012
WHAT WAS YOUR, LIKE,
FAVORITE MEMORY?

20:26.050 --> 20:28.518
NO, NO.
YOUR MOST FUN STORY.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.654
IT'S JUST SMALL THINGS,
REALLY.

20:31.690 --> 20:32.918
YEAH?

20:32.960 --> 20:35.394
THERE WAS THIS--THIS ONE TIME
WE WERE TRACKING THESE TWO GUYS,

20:35.430 --> 20:38.922
AND WE HAD TO STAY UP FOR...
29, 30 HOURS STRAIGHT THROUGH.

20:38.970 --> 20:40.597
NICE.
PLAYING THESE LITTLE GAMES
TO KEEP OURSELVES AWAKE.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.766
YEAH.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.337
AND WE HAD THIS ONE WHERE
WE'D TUNE INTO THIS STATION

20:44.370 --> 20:46.361
THAT JUST PLAYED
OLD FRENCH MOVIES,

20:46.410 --> 20:49.629
AND WE'D PUT IT ON MUTE,
AND WE'D DUB THE OLD MOVIES...

20:49.680 --> 20:50.908
(speaks indistinctly)

20:50.950 --> 20:52.872
NO, SHE...

20:55.480 --> 20:57.414
OH, UM, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT U.C. STUFF

20:57.450 --> 20:59.543
LIKE POLICING, BUT...

20:59.590 --> 21:04.323
OH, YEAH. NO, I--
UH.... IT WAS GOOD.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.351
IT WAS FUN.
IT WAS INTENSE, BUT...

21:06.390 --> 21:07.322
IT WAS GOOD.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.554
COOL. COOL.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.589
SORRY.
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT...

21:09.630 --> 21:12.428
(typing)
(computer beeps)

21:16.840 --> 21:20.537
(dog barking in distance)

21:20.580 --> 21:22.775
(police radio chatter)

21:27.950 --> 21:30.783
AFTERNOON. HEY THERE.

21:30.820 --> 21:31.787
HOW YOU DOING TODAY?

21:31.820 --> 21:33.310
COULD BE BETTER.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.315
WHO ARE YOU PICKING UP?

21:34.360 --> 21:35.452
SOME KID NAMED TEDDY.

21:35.490 --> 21:38.459
(horn honks)

21:38.490 --> 21:39.457
COME ON. LET'S GO.

21:39.490 --> 21:42.653
HEY, TEDDY. WHERE YOU HEADED?

21:42.700 --> 21:44.725
(Gail) YOU TAKE THE BACK!

21:51.440 --> 21:52.429
AAH!

21:53.980 --> 21:55.504
(radio chatter)

21:55.540 --> 21:57.576
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU RUN.

21:57.610 --> 21:58.747
(girl) STOP!
DON'T--DON'T HURT HIM!

21:58.780 --> 22:00.577
JUST, PLEASE,
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT--

22:00.620 --> 22:01.575
WE'RE NOT GONNA HURT HIM, OKAY?
IT'S MY FAULT.
IT'S MY FAULT.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.848
JUST CALM DOWN.
WE'RE JUST GONNA TALK WITH HIM.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.347
COME WITH ME, OKAY?

22:04.390 --> 22:05.618
THIS WHOLE THING
JUST GOT SO MESSED UP.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.083
DAWN,
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.554
(sighs)

22:09.590 --> 22:12.423
I CAME HOME, AND THEY HAD
THEIR CLOTHES HALF OFF.

22:12.460 --> 22:13.688
IF I'D COME HOME ANY LATER,

22:13.730 --> 22:16.392
WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT FREAK
WOULD HAVE DONE?
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

22:16.430 --> 22:18.967
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE
INVITED ALEX HERE.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.696
I KNEW IF ANYBODY FOUND OUT,
IT WOULD BE BAD.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.709
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN ALEX CAME OVER TODAY?

22:24.740 --> 22:26.435
WE HUNG OUT IN MY ROOM.

22:26.470 --> 22:30.406
WE WATCHED SOME STUFF
ON YouTube.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.906
AND...

22:31.950 --> 22:35.647
WE... KISSED A LITTLE.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.389
BUT THAT'S ALL
UNTIL TEDDY CAME HOME.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.684
HE JUST FREAKED OUT.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.950
HE THREW ALEX UP
AGAINST THE WALL,

22:43.990 --> 22:46.982
AND I THINK
ALEX HIT HIS HEAD.

22:47.030 --> 22:48.224
IT ALL HAPPENED
REALLY FAST.

22:48.260 --> 22:51.525
THE NEXT THING I KNEW, TEDDY WAS
DRAGGING HIM OUT TO THE CAR.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.969
YOU SHOULD BE OUT THERE
LOOKING FOR THAT WEIRDO

22:53.000 --> 22:53.989
INSTEAD OF HASSLING ME.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.962
I WAS JUST PROTECTING
MY SISTER.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.809
OH, BY PUTTING ALEX
IN THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR?

22:57.840 --> 22:59.102
I WAS GONNA TAKE HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL AND DUMP HIM.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.971
MY PRIORITY WAS DAWN,

23:01.010 --> 23:03.103
NOT THE BOY-GIRL I FOUND
ON TOP OF HER.
(handcuffs clacking)

23:03.140 --> 23:04.573
TEDDY FISHER,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

23:04.610 --> 23:06.168
FOR ASSAULT
AND KIDNAPPING.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.347
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

23:07.380 --> 23:10.713
DO I NOT LOOK S--HEY!
DAWN!
I NEED TO TALK TO DAWN!

23:12.850 --> 23:14.818
LOOK WHAT YOU DID. (grunts)

23:14.860 --> 23:17.454
THEY'RE ARRESTING ME.
THIS IS YOUR_ FAULT.
(handcuffs clicking)

23:17.490 --> 23:18.559
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING,

23:18.590 --> 23:19.682
BRINGING THAT FREAK SHOW
IN OUR HOUSE?!

23:19.730 --> 23:21.550
I DON'T KNOW!

23:21.600 --> 23:22.726
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

23:22.760 --> 23:25.695
I JUST REALLY LIKED HIM!

23:28.200 --> 23:29.929
HEY, I WAS SERIOUS
ABOUT BEFORE.

23:29.970 --> 23:31.631
WE SHOULD GET OUR KIDS TOGETHER
FOR A PLAYDATE,

23:31.670 --> 23:33.103
SINCE WE'RE BOTH
STICKING AROUND THIS WEEKEND.

23:33.140 --> 23:35.631
TODDLERS AND TEENAGERS DON'T
REALLY HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.829
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

23:36.880 --> 23:38.871
(radio chatter)
CHRISTIAN'S REALLY MATURE
FOR HIS AGE.

23:38.910 --> 23:40.912
YEAH? HOW OLD IS HE?
HE'S 2 1/2.

23:40.950 --> 23:44.181
MY KID HAS BLUE HAIR
AND A NOSE RING.

23:44.220 --> 23:46.484
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.987
LOOK, I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE COULD HELP EACH OTHER OUT,

23:48.020 --> 23:50.818
BUT NEVER MIND.
WHOA. HELP EACH OTHER OUT?

23:50.860 --> 23:53.624
YOU KNOW,
WITH ZOE AND DENISE.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.754
WHAT IS WRONG WITH DENISE?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.165
(radio chatter)

23:58.200 --> 24:01.897
ALL RIGHT. S-SO DENISE
LIKES RUG HOOKING,

24:01.940 --> 24:03.567
SO I TRIED RUG HOOKING.

24:03.610 --> 24:07.239
AND SHE LIKES REALITY TV,
SO I WATCH IT WITH HER.

24:07.270 --> 24:10.478
YOU KNOW, I TELL HER SHE LOOKS
BEAUTIFUL EVERY SINGLE MORNING,

24:10.510 --> 24:14.913
EVEN WHEN HER HAIR IS WEIRD,
AND NOTHING IS WORKING.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.975
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE
IN COMMON IS CHRISTIAN.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.238
DIAZ, IS THAT WHY
YOU DIDN'T GO CAMPING?

24:19.290 --> 24:20.985
CAN'T BRING DENISE.

24:21.020 --> 24:24.126
I MEAN, EVERYONE WOULD SEE
HOW WE ARE TOGETHER.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.754
I DON'T...
I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW.

24:26.790 --> 24:29.588
(radio chatter continues)

24:29.630 --> 24:32.064
(Oliver) I THINK YOU GOTTA
KEEP TRYING THINGS WITH DENISE.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.738
YOU KNOW?
IT'S GONNA GET EASIER.

24:33.770 --> 24:36.534
OR IT'S GONNA ALL
COME CRASHING DOWN.

24:36.570 --> 24:38.561
(sighs)

24:38.610 --> 24:39.736
EITHER WAY, YOU DID
EVERYTHING YOU COULD

24:39.770 --> 24:41.829
TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK.
(door unlocks)

24:41.880 --> 24:43.973
(door creaks)

24:44.010 --> 24:46.046
OFFICERS. ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.718
YOU BY YOURSELF?

24:47.750 --> 24:50.639
OF COURSE.
YOU MIND IF WE COME IN?

24:50.690 --> 24:51.714
COME ON IN.

24:51.750 --> 24:52.944
THAN KS, SHAY.

24:52.990 --> 24:53.979
SHOULD'VE TOLD ME
YOU WERE COMING.

24:54.020 --> 24:55.749
I WOULD'VE PICKED UP
A SIX-PACK.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.257
(door closes)
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:57.290 --> 24:58.723
IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS,
RIGHT, PAL?

24:58.760 --> 24:59.988
WELL, YOU COULD SEARCH
ALL YOU WANT,

25:00.030 --> 25:01.998
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FIND ANYTHING. I'M CLEAN.

25:02.030 --> 25:03.691
OH, YOU'RE CLEAN, HUH?
MM-HMM.

25:03.730 --> 25:05.163
SO YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT A SHOOTING?

25:05.200 --> 25:07.691
(police radio chatter,
siren wailing in distance)

25:07.740 --> 25:10.038
LAST NIGHT, SKATE PARK ON RIVER.

25:10.070 --> 25:11.799
16-YEAR-OLD KID
GOT SHOT AND KILLED.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.159
OH, I'M SORRY, GENTLEMEN,

25:13.210 --> 25:16.099
BUT LAST NIGHT I WAS OVER
IN LOCKUP OVER AT 27

25:16.140 --> 25:17.744
FOR A... MISUNDERSTANDING.

25:17.780 --> 25:18.769
UH-HUH.

25:18.810 --> 25:20.778
THE KID GOT HIT BECAUSE
SOMEONE WAS TAKING SHOTS

25:20.820 --> 25:21.946
AT CESAR MEDINA.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.187
I FIGURED IT'D BE
A GOOD BET.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.917
MEDINA? THOUGHT HE WAS OUT
OR WHATEVER.

25:27.960 --> 25:28.949
MOVED AWAY.

25:28.990 --> 25:30.719
WELL, HE CAME BACK
FOR A VISIT.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.829
OOH, BAD MOVE.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.919
THAT'S A BAD MOVE?
WHY IS THAT?

25:33.960 --> 25:35.689
THOSE VIBORAS--
THEY--THEY TAKE BLOOD OATHS

25:35.730 --> 25:37.129
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.196
ONLY WAY YOU LEAVE THOSE GUYS
IS IN A BOX.

25:39.230 --> 25:41.937
SO YOU'RE SAYING IT'S HIS
OWN GUYS THAT WERE AFTER HIM?

25:41.970 --> 25:43.767
HEY, ALL I'M SAYING IS
IT WASN'T US.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.062
(radio chatter,
siren wailing in distance)

25:46.110 --> 25:48.908
(indistinct conversations)

25:48.940 --> 25:49.975
(door buzzes in distance)

25:50.010 --> 25:51.079
SO I'VE CALLED YOUR PARENTS.

25:51.110 --> 25:53.817
IT'S GONNA TAKE 'EM A FEW HOURS
TO GET BACK INTO TOWN.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.044
IN THE MEANTIME, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SEPARATE YOU TWO.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.775
OKAY, SO WHERE
DO YOU WANT HIM?

25:56.820 --> 25:57.844
TAKE HIM UP TO MY OFFICE.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.711
(radio chatter, telephone rings)

26:00.760 --> 26:02.751
ALEX IS MISSING.

26:02.790 --> 26:03.984
HE TOOK OFF
FROM THE HOSPITAL

26:04.030 --> 26:04.928
WHEN THE SOCIAL WORKER
WAS WITH HIM.

26:04.960 --> 26:07.952
NOW DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE MIGHT BE?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.252
NO. I HAVE NO IDEA.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.894
(sighs) OKAY. TAKE HER
TO THE INTERVIEW ROOM.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.892
OKAY.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.659
(door buzzes and beeps)

26:19.710 --> 26:20.699
LOOK, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DETECTIVE.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.970
I'M NOT NEW AT THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

26:23.010 --> 26:25.001
(door closes)
YOU HAVE NO CHARGES AGAINST ME,
SO YOU'VE GOT, WHAT,

26:25.050 --> 26:26.847
ABOUT ANOTHER HOUR
BEFORE YOU LET ME GO?

26:26.880 --> 26:28.745
A FEW
OF YOUR VIBORAS BROTHERS.

26:28.780 --> 26:30.008
UNH-UNH. NOT ANYMORE.

26:30.050 --> 26:31.608
NOT ANYMORE.

26:31.650 --> 26:32.719
I HEAR THEY, UH,
DON'T TAKE TOO WELL

26:32.750 --> 26:35.116
TO MEMBERS WALKING OUT ON THEM.
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

26:35.160 --> 26:37.856
I PAID MY WAY OUT.

26:37.890 --> 26:39.255
CUT MY TIES.
I MOVED AWAY.

26:39.290 --> 26:40.723
DID EXACTLY
WHAT THEY ASKED.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.749
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHY'D YOU COME BACK?

26:41.800 --> 26:43.791
I CAME BACK TO LOOK UP
ON RICHIE.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.388
YOU KNOW, DIDN'T HAVE A DAD,
TRY TO BE THERE FOR HIM.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.864
TYPICAL GHETTO STORY.
MM-HMM. RIGHT.

26:47.900 --> 26:50.391
I SPOKE TO HIS AUNT.
SHE SAID RICHIE WAS A GREAT KID,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.203
SWEET, ALWAYS SMILING.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.003
SOUNDS LIKE
HE WAS DOING FINE TO ME.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.749
I'M GONNA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.839
RICHIE LOVED SKATEBOARDING.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.017
I PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE,

27:01.050 --> 27:04.019
WANTED TO GET HIM
A CUSTOM BOARD MADE.

27:04.050 --> 27:08.157
THAT'S WHY I CAME BACK.
I WANTED TO SURPRISE HIM.

27:08.190 --> 27:09.657
(clicks teeth)

27:09.690 --> 27:12.284
CESAR...
YOU'RE GOOD WITH KIDS, RIGHT?

27:12.330 --> 27:14.753
YOU LOVE YOUR JOB.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.893
I CALLED YOUR BOSS
IN MONTREAL.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.693
HE TELLS ME YOU'RE
COUNSELING TEENAGERS NOW,

27:18.730 --> 27:21.062
HELPING 'EM
GET OUT OF THE GANGS.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.068
THEY RESPECT YOU 'CAUSE
YOU TURNED YOUR LIFE AROUND.

27:24.770 --> 27:26.169
(clicks teeth)

27:26.210 --> 27:29.008
SO?
SO? (sniffs)

27:29.040 --> 27:30.439
SO NOW YOU WANNA GO BACK?

27:30.480 --> 27:32.744
YOU GONNA GET OUTTA HERE,
GUN THOSE GUYS DOWN

27:32.780 --> 27:34.816
WHO SHOT YOUR COUSIN
AND TH ROW THAT ALL AWAY?

27:37.350 --> 27:39.910
SHOW ME WHO SHOT RICHIE.
LET ME TAKE CARE OF IT.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.680
I TOLD YOU.
I TOLD YOU ALREADY, MAN.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.324
I DID NOT SEE
THEIR FACES.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.796
LOOK, LET ME GO HOME.

27:47.830 --> 27:49.092
I PROMISE YOU
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

27:49.130 --> 27:51.189
ANYTHING COMES UP,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

27:51.230 --> 27:54.290
I PROMISE, JUST LET ME GO.
(clicks teeth)

27:54.340 --> 27:55.989
(door buzzes and beeps)

28:02.810 --> 28:04.107
IT'S A FAMILY THING.
HE AIN'T TALKING.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.243
WELL, I CAN'T KEEP HIM HERE
ANY LONGER.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.249
BEST CASE SCENARIO--HE'S BACK
ON THE STREET IN HALF AN HOUR.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.317
WE COULD CUT HIM LOOSE,
TAIL HIM.

28:12.350 --> 28:13.817
LET HIM KNOW
WE'RE WATCHING.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.112
HE'S NOT GONNA CARE.
HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.787
(sighs) WE LET THIS GUY
WALK OUTTA HERE,

28:17.830 --> 28:20.185
HE'S GONNA SPEND THE REST
OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON.

28:20.230 --> 28:21.959
(knocks)

28:22.000 --> 28:23.353
SIR--
SIR, I THINK WE FOUND
SOMETHING.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.119
I MEAN, WE DEFINITELY
FOUND SOMETHING,

28:26.170 --> 28:27.831
BUT BY SOMETHING, I--
WE JUST...

28:27.870 --> 28:29.030
COLLINS?

28:29.070 --> 28:30.037
TECH RECOVERED THESE
FROM THE VICTIM'S CELL.

28:30.070 --> 28:31.435
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
GONNA SAY.

28:31.470 --> 28:34.177
TEXT MESSAGES, ALL SENT
WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE SHOOTING.

28:34.210 --> 28:36.075
(paper rustles)

28:36.110 --> 28:39.273
(whispers) OH, MAN.

28:39.310 --> 28:43.417
GUESS CESAR CAN STOP
FEELING GUILTY.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.214
(door buzzes and beeps)

28:46.250 --> 28:47.319
BRO, I'M DONE.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.954
I JUST WANT YOU TO SEE
SOMETHING BEFORE YOU GO, CESAR.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.527
NO, I'M DONE.
I GOT NOTHING.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.187
TEXT MESSAGES FROM
YOUR COUSIN RICHIE LAST NIGHT.

28:53.230 --> 28:54.424
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.155
OKAY, I'M GONNA READ 'EM
TO YOU.

28:56.200 --> 29:02.366
(sighs) SENT 9:47 P.M.--
"HE'S BACK. ALL GOOD."

29:02.400 --> 29:06.302
RECEIVED 9:52 P.M.--
"COOL."

29:06.340 --> 29:09.468
SENT 10:23 P.M.--
BRO,
IS THIS GETTING ANYWHERE?

29:09.510 --> 29:11.444
"CRUISING AROUND."

29:11.480 --> 29:17.146
SENT 10:45 P.M.--
"HEADING TO SKATE PARK."

29:17.180 --> 29:19.216
RECEIVED 10:52 P.M.--

29:19.250 --> 29:21.980
"READY FOR YOU.
GET HIM HERE."

29:22.020 --> 29:25.421
SENT 10:53 P.M.--
"COOL."

29:32.270 --> 29:34.158
I'M SORRY, MAN.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.293
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR COUSIN RICHIE SET YOU UP.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.008
HE WOULDN'T.

29:40.040 --> 29:43.476
WHO DID YOU TELL YOU WERE
COMING BACK TO TOWN?

29:47.380 --> 29:49.041
(sniffles)

29:49.080 --> 29:51.844
I TOLD MY AUNT AND RICHIE.

29:51.890 --> 29:54.950
OKAY, AND WHOSE IDEA WAS IT
TO GO TO THE SKATE PARK?

29:57.190 --> 29:59.078
RICHIE'S.

30:05.370 --> 30:09.329
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
(sniffles)

30:09.370 --> 30:12.407
HE'S A GREAT KID.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.431
HE'S A GREAT KID.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.232
WHY WOULD HE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

30:16.280 --> 30:19.875
HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU GOT
HOOKED UP WITH LOS VIBORAS?

30:21.950 --> 30:23.042
14.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.538
I WAS 14.

30:26.590 --> 30:28.956
AND WHAT'D YOU HAVE TO DO?

30:31.290 --> 30:32.552
(sniffles)

30:38.900 --> 30:40.322
CESAR.

30:44.540 --> 30:46.633
I KNOW YOU WANNA TAKE CARE
OF THESE GUYS.

30:46.670 --> 30:50.174
I GET THAT, BELIEVE ME,

30:50.210 --> 30:52.872
BUT YOUR COUSIN
MADE A CHOICE.

30:52.910 --> 30:55.071
IF HIS BUDDIES
WERE A BETTER SHOT,

30:55.120 --> 30:58.089
YOU WOULD BE DEAD
RIGHT NOW, NOT RICHIE.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.111
(inhales and exhales deeply)

31:00.150 --> 31:01.913
CESAR, LISTEN.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.018
LISTEN.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.459
YOU GOT OUT.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.322
SO STAY OUT.

31:08.360 --> 31:13.024
LET ME DO MY JOB.
LET ME TAKE CARE OF IT.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.660
(sighs)

31:20.540 --> 31:21.575
(sniffles)

31:21.610 --> 31:23.168
(sighs)

31:25.380 --> 31:27.940
(exhales)

31:27.980 --> 31:30.517
(exhales)
PAOLO WAS THE SHOOTER.

31:36.260 --> 31:37.352
TEE HAD HIS BACK.

31:37.390 --> 31:38.584
(sniffs)

31:40.230 --> 31:41.492
(exhales)

31:45.500 --> 31:46.626
(sighs)

31:46.670 --> 31:48.069
(indistinct conversations)

31:48.100 --> 31:49.397
ALL RIGHT. THANKS. BYE.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.395
(receiver clatters)
HEY.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.464
ANY LUCK TRACKING ALEX?

31:51.510 --> 31:54.604
THAT'S A BIG FAT NEGATIVE.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.528
(buzzing)
IT'S DAWN'S. SHE LEFT IT
IN OUR SQUAD CAR,

31:56.580 --> 31:58.548
AND IT'S BEEN BUZZING
NONSTOP.

31:58.580 --> 32:01.572
(buzzing continues)

32:01.620 --> 32:04.214
(telephone ringing in distance)

32:04.250 --> 32:06.582
(buzzing continues)

32:06.620 --> 32:08.485
OPEN THE BAG.
GET YOUR PHONE OUT.

32:08.520 --> 32:09.589
(zipper whirs)

32:09.620 --> 32:11.952
(buzzing continues)

32:11.990 --> 32:14.026
IT'S ALEX.

32:14.060 --> 32:15.288
ANSWER IT.

32:15.330 --> 32:17.969
NO.
DAWN, ANSWER YOUR PHONE.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.695
(buzzing continues)
I'M SERIOUS.
ANSWER THE PHONE.

32:19.730 --> 32:21.288
HE CAME HERE TO BE WITH ME.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.398
(buzzing continues)

32:22.440 --> 32:23.964
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT
BETTER.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.331
INSTEAD I GOT HIM BEAT UP
AND THROWN AWAY

32:26.370 --> 32:27.598
LIKE A PIECE OF GARBAGE.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.733
(buttons click)

32:29.780 --> 32:32.999
ALEX? IT'S OFFICER MCNALLY.

32:33.050 --> 32:35.018
WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

32:35.050 --> 32:36.472
JUST STOP.

32:40.650 --> 32:43.187
(Gail) WHAT?

32:43.220 --> 32:45.051
I-I COULDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE WAS SAYING,

32:45.090 --> 32:49.356
BUT I THINK THAT HE WAS CALLING
TO TELL DAWN GOOD-BYE FOR GOOD.

32:52.730 --> 32:56.131
HEAD TO THE BUS STATION.
MAYBE WE'LL CATCH A BREAK,

32:56.170 --> 32:58.058
AND YOU'LL FIND ALEX WAITING
FOR A BUS HOME.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.463
YEAH, AND IF WE'RE
NOT THAT LUCKY?

32:59.510 --> 33:01.034
I'M GONNA TALK TO DAWN AGAIN.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.536
I'M HOPING SHE KNOWS
MORE THAN SHE THINKS.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.105
COME ON, ALEX.
PICK UP THE PHONE.

33:05.150 --> 33:05.969
OKAY, JUST SEND HIM A TEXT

33:06.010 --> 33:08.069
AND SAY THAT DAWN
NEEDS TO TALK TO HIM

33:08.120 --> 33:09.576
AND JUST SEE IF YOU CAN
GET HIM ON VIDEO.

33:09.620 --> 33:10.746
OKAY.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.509
(buttons clicking,
cell phone chimes)

33:12.550 --> 33:13.710
HOPE THIS WORKS.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.412
(radio chatter)

33:16.460 --> 33:19.020
(cell phone buzzes)

33:19.060 --> 33:20.288
ALEX?

33:20.330 --> 33:22.321
IT'S OFFICER MCNALLY.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.260
Where's Dawn?

33:24.300 --> 33:26.768
She said she needed--
She said she needed to see me.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.165
UH, NO, DAWN IS REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.690
SHE ASKED ME TO TALK TO YOU.

33:29.740 --> 33:32.231
ANDY, HE DOESN'T
SOUND GOOD.

33:32.270 --> 33:34.807
ALEX, YOU GOTTA TELL US
WHERE YOU ARE.

33:34.840 --> 33:38.446
Dawn, I'm so, so sorry.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.801
Everything just--
just got all screwed up.

33:40.850 --> 33:45.219
God, I have to put
the phone down now, okay?

33:45.250 --> 33:47.639
NO, NO, NO, WAIT. ALEX,
JUST--CRAP.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.356
HEY, TRACE,
WE JUST HAD HIM ON VIDEO.

33:52.390 --> 33:54.494
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS
IN A MOTEL ROOM.

33:54.530 --> 33:55.690
DID ALEX SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT A MOTEL?

33:55.730 --> 33:57.095
ANYWHERE HE MIGHT
BE STAYING?

33:57.130 --> 33:59.223
NO, HE DIDN'T.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.636
OKAY, WHAT ELSE DID YOU SEE
IN THE VIDEO?

34:01.670 --> 34:02.637
A bed.

34:02.670 --> 34:04.501
UH, A COUPLE WINDOWS.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.428
UH, THE DOORS LOOKED
BRIGHT RED.

34:06.470 --> 34:07.607
LIKE FIRE ENGINE RED?

34:07.640 --> 34:08.777
Yeah.

34:08.810 --> 34:09.708
TRY THE SILVER BEACH MOTEL.

34:09.740 --> 34:11.640
WE DID A JOHN SWEEP THERE
TWO MONTHS AGO.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.272
ALL RIGHT.
SILVER BEACH MOTEL.

34:13.310 --> 34:14.572
THAT'S PARK LAWN
AND LAKESHORE.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.645
(siren wailing)

34:16.680 --> 34:19.649
(tires screeching)

34:28.360 --> 34:29.292
(radio chatter)

34:29.330 --> 34:30.752
(Alex) HI. WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A TEENAGE BOY.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.462
BLUE AND RED STRIPED SHIRT.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.263
(man speaks indistinctly)

34:35.300 --> 34:37.439
111.

34:37.470 --> 34:38.698
IT'S AT THE END.
THAT WAY!

34:44.680 --> 34:45.772
ALEX?

34:45.810 --> 34:47.368
(pounds on door)
ALEX!

34:47.410 --> 34:48.638
OH, IT'S LOCKED.

34:48.680 --> 34:49.647
NO, WE GOTTA KICK IT IN.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.318
ONE, TWO, THREE.

34:52.720 --> 34:55.712
OH, MY GOD.
15-09.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.489
WE NEED MEDICS
TO THE SILVER BEACH MOTEL.
(static crackles)

34:57.520 --> 34:59.181
(female dispatcher)
Unit 15-09...

34:59.230 --> 35:00.652
GAIL, I NEED SOMETHING.

35:00.690 --> 35:02.294
...to your location.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.360
THANK YOU.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.492
(radio chatter)

35:07.530 --> 35:10.590
(siren wailing in distance)

35:10.640 --> 35:12.904
OH. WHAT DID YOU DO?

35:12.940 --> 35:15.408
(sirens wailing)

35:17.840 --> 35:19.444
MY PARENTS WON'T
TALK TO ME.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.447
THEY WON'T EVEN LOOK
AT ME.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.619
NOBODY WILL TALK TO ME.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.515
(sighs) YOU SHOULD'VE
JUST LEFT ME.

35:26.420 --> 35:30.481
LOOK, I-I DON'T KNOW
HOW HARD IT IS TO BE YOU.

35:30.520 --> 35:32.283
(monitor beeping steadily)

35:32.330 --> 35:34.457
BUT THAT IS NOT THE ANSWER.

35:34.500 --> 35:38.322
LOOK AT ME.

35:38.370 --> 35:41.567
YOU ARE NOT WORTHLESS.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.897
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.374
I THINK YOU JUST
KEEP GOING.

35:48.410 --> 35:51.641
AND EVERY DAY IT JUST...

35:51.680 --> 35:55.377
GETS BETTER
LITTLE BY LITTLE.

35:55.420 --> 35:56.842
(sighs) HOW DO YOU KNOW?

35:56.880 --> 35:58.939
LOOK, YOU'RE 15 YEARS OLD,

35:58.990 --> 36:00.184
AND YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

36:00.220 --> 36:04.759
I MEAN, THAT TAKES MOST PEOPLE
SUCH A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT,

36:04.790 --> 36:06.678
BELIEVE ME.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.660
I THINK
YOU'RE INCREDIBLY BRAVE.

36:11.700 --> 36:16.262
AND YOU'RE SMART
AND KIND.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.701
AND HONESTLY, THE WORLD IS
A BETTER PLACE WITH YOU IN IT.

36:19.740 --> 36:23.528
I JUST MET YOU,
AND I'M SURE OF THAT.

36:23.580 --> 36:24.547
SO...

36:24.580 --> 36:26.571
LET'S KEEP GOING.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.412
OKAY?

36:32.590 --> 36:34.410
(door opens)

36:44.700 --> 36:46.258
HI.

36:55.910 --> 36:58.344
YOU READY TO HIT
THE HIGHWAY?

36:58.380 --> 37:00.405
I'M GONNA STAY HERE
A LITTLE BIT LONGER,

37:00.450 --> 37:03.476
JUST MAKE SURE
THEY'RE OKAY.

37:03.520 --> 37:04.612
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:04.650 --> 37:05.810
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
JUST GO WITHOUT ME?

37:05.850 --> 37:07.545
OH, NO. I AM NOT GOING
WITHOUT YOU.

37:07.590 --> 37:09.512
I BARELY WANNA GO WITH YOU.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.428
YOU SURE?
YES.

37:18.930 --> 37:20.488
(sighs)

37:22.840 --> 37:24.762
WHAT KIND
OF CHEESEBURGER?

37:24.810 --> 37:26.368
PARDON?

37:26.410 --> 37:28.002
WELL, YOU SAID YOU HAD
A CHEESEBURGER FOR BREAKFAST.

37:28.040 --> 37:28.938
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT KIND.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.039
LIKE, WAS IT, UH,
STORE-BOUGHT OR HOMEMADE?

37:31.080 --> 37:32.809
BECAUSE I JUST BOUGHT A BUNCH
OF HAMBURGER PATTIES

37:32.850 --> 37:34.545
FOR THIS CAMPING TRIP
WE GO ON EVERY YEAR,

37:34.580 --> 37:36.548
AND I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE
THEY'RE THE SAME ONES.

37:36.580 --> 37:39.287
SHE DIED--
THE WOMAN I SHOT.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.685
I WENT BY THE HOSPITAL
TO SEE HOW SHE WAS DOING,

37:40.720 --> 37:42.381
AND THEY TOLD ME
SHE PASSED AWAY.

37:42.420 --> 37:44.854
SO, NO, DOV,
I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING,

37:44.890 --> 37:47.825
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TOO BUSY
GOING OVER THAT SHOOTING

37:47.860 --> 37:48.929
AGAIN AND AGAIN,

37:48.960 --> 37:51.861
WONDERING IF I COULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

37:51.900 --> 37:56.667
FOUR YEARS ON S.W.A.T., AND I
NEVER HAD TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

37:56.700 --> 38:00.636
WILDLIFE DOCUMENTARIES.

38:00.670 --> 38:02.934
TRY WATCHING 'EM
BEFORE YOU GO TO BED.

38:02.980 --> 38:04.641
THEY HELPED ME
GET THROUGH THE NIGHT.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.409
OH.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.315
AND TEEN FICTION NOVELS.

38:08.350 --> 38:10.910
I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD,
BUT TRUST ME, THEY--

38:10.950 --> 38:12.315
THEY WORK.

38:15.790 --> 38:19.749
THANKS.
HAVE A NICE WEEKEND.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.966
DAY TRIP?
YOU'LL BE BACK BY DINNER.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.638
YOU KNOW, DENISE WON'T
EVEN KNOW YOU'RE GONE.

38:31.670 --> 38:35.674
PLUS SHE CAN SPARE YOU
FOR THE DAY, RIGHT?
DOV, I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
MAN. I...

38:35.710 --> 38:38.372
COME ON. IT'S OUR LAST CHANCE
TO ALL BE TOGETHER.

38:38.410 --> 38:41.948
(closes locker door)
I'LL SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY.

38:41.980 --> 38:43.538
YOU'RE ON A LEASH.

38:43.580 --> 38:44.547
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

38:44.590 --> 38:46.945
HEY, EPSTEIN.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.048
GO EASY ON DIAZ.

38:48.090 --> 38:50.615
UH, OKAY.
I'M JUST BUSTING HIS CHOPS.

38:50.660 --> 38:54.357
UH, GOTTA BE KINDA TOUGH
THAT HE'S TAKING OFF, YEAH?

38:54.400 --> 38:56.652
YEAH, IT IS.
IT'S LIKE LOSING A BROTHER.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.565
YEAH. AND YOU'VE SAID IT
YOURSELF.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.966
HE'S THE GUY WHO WILL ALWAYS
DO THE RIGHT THING

39:01.000 --> 39:04.060
EVEN WHEN IT SUCKS.
RIGHT?

39:04.100 --> 39:07.501
SO... YOU KNOW,
GO A LITTLE EASY ON DIAZ.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.739
YOU READY
TO DO THIS THING?

39:15.780 --> 39:17.509
YOU DON'T REALLY WANNA GO
CAMPING, DO YOU?

39:17.550 --> 39:19.415
NO.
WE'RE GOING. WE'RE GOING.

39:19.450 --> 39:21.816
LEO'S BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS FOR WEEKS.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.079
I HAVE AN IDEA.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.688
(Serena Ryan)

39:30.130 --> 39:33.497

39:36.470 --> 39:38.961

39:41.070 --> 39:42.469
SHUT UP.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.977
COME ON.

39:44.010 --> 39:46.570
(sets down bag)
* OH, WHAT I WOULDN'T DO

39:46.610 --> 39:50.046
* I'LL CARRY THE WEIGHT

39:50.080 --> 39:53.743
WHOA. (laughs)
* I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU

39:53.790 --> 39:55.052

39:55.090 --> 39:57.650

IF WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

39:57.690 --> 39:59.658
(Traci) HEY, YOU.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.692

40:58.280 --> 41:02.159

41:12.530 --> 41:15.590
DO YOU MIND IF I START BY
GIVING YOU SOME FRIENDLY ADVICE?

41:28.880 --> 41:31.178
AND I THINK IT'S PATHETIC,

41:31.220 --> 41:34.849
AND I THINK IT'S DESPERATE.

41:34.890 --> 41:36.050
WELL, THAT'S NOT
VERY FRIENDLY ADVICE.

41:36.090 --> 41:38.854
