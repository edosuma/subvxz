WEBVTT

00:07.458 --> 00:08.750
He's dead! Come on!

00:08.875 --> 00:10.000
[screaming]

00:10.416 --> 00:11.833
[whooshing]

00:11.916 --> 00:12.958
What...

00:13.208 --> 00:15.041
Up she goes...

00:15.125 --> 00:16.875
[Nori] Where is it you're from, anyway?

00:16.958 --> 00:17.750
[breathing heavily]

00:19.250 --> 00:20.250
-[snaps]
-[bone crunches]

00:20.375 --> 00:21.250
[Largo groans]

00:23.291 --> 00:25.916
He wants us to help him find those stars.

00:28.208 --> 00:29.458
Nori?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
[Galadriel] Duty demanded
I return to Middle-earth.

00:35.041 --> 00:38.625
It wasn't Elves that chased me
from my homeland. It was Orcs.

00:38.708 --> 00:40.833
Was that the mark of your people's king?

00:40.916 --> 00:41.958
My people have no king.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.000
[thunder breaking]

00:51.916 --> 00:54.458
All the far outposts are being disbanded.

00:54.541 --> 00:56.000
Taking a last look?

00:56.083 --> 00:57.791
It has changed much, Watchwarden.

00:57.875 --> 00:59.625
But the Men who live here have not.

00:59.708 --> 01:03.833
The blood of those who stood with Morgoth
still darkens their veins.

01:03.916 --> 01:07.500
-Someone dug this passage.
-Something. Men did not do this.

01:08.125 --> 01:09.708
[gasping]

01:10.625 --> 01:11.625
[bubbling]

01:12.416 --> 01:13.333
[shouts]

01:16.375 --> 01:18.375
[theme music playing]

02:58.708 --> 03:00.500
[panting]

03:12.333 --> 03:13.250
[gasping]

03:13.875 --> 03:15.333
[woman screaming in distance]

03:15.416 --> 03:16.458
[grunting]

03:20.750 --> 03:23.791
[women shouting]

03:24.333 --> 03:25.375
[snarls]

03:25.458 --> 03:26.333
[shouts]

03:27.041 --> 03:28.125
[Lurka] Get to it.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.083
[man groans]

03:29.375 --> 03:30.791
-[gasping]
-[snarls]

03:30.875 --> 03:31.916
[groans]

03:33.458 --> 03:36.083
[Lurka] You there! Anchor him.

03:36.666 --> 03:38.291
Toss him out with the rest.

03:38.375 --> 03:41.958
[Vrath] You toss him out with the rest.
I had sun duty yesterday.

03:42.041 --> 03:45.666
[Lurka] You'll stay in the sun
till you're black as coal

03:45.750 --> 03:46.916
if Adar wills it.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.041
[Vrath] For Adar, then. But not for you!

03:50.333 --> 03:51.208
[groans]

03:52.083 --> 03:54.458
[panting]

03:55.083 --> 03:56.416
[snickering]

03:56.500 --> 03:58.916
For Adar.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.041
[growls]

04:01.625 --> 04:03.250
[Vrath wheezing]

04:04.125 --> 04:05.583
[clinking]

04:09.458 --> 04:11.333
[Vrath] Rest's over, slothabout.

04:11.416 --> 04:13.541
Now dig. [grunts]

04:14.333 --> 04:15.333
[groans]

04:16.125 --> 04:17.000
[gasps]

04:19.875 --> 04:21.208
[sighing]

04:37.083 --> 04:39.500
[women screaming]

04:43.416 --> 04:44.416
[whipping]

04:44.500 --> 04:46.916
[Orcs shouting]

04:47.041 --> 04:50.541
[crowds groaning, screaming]

04:50.625 --> 04:52.416
[whipping continues]

04:52.500 --> 04:53.541
[gasps]

04:58.250 --> 05:01.750
[creaking]

05:01.833 --> 05:03.666
[panting]

05:04.583 --> 05:05.625
[Halbrand] She lives.

05:15.833 --> 05:19.541
Our hosts. Saviors or captors?

05:20.166 --> 05:22.666
It's not poisoned. If that's your concern.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.166
Not for humans, anyway.

05:29.791 --> 05:33.291
[footsteps approaching]

05:33.625 --> 05:36.916
[latch opening]

05:40.541 --> 05:42.750
[waves splashing]

06:23.416 --> 06:26.833
One of the Eldar. Onboard my ship?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.541
Strange tides indeed.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.958
What vessel is this?

06:33.041 --> 06:36.541
Be at ease. I'm obliged to deliver you
safely to my betters.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.958
They will answer your questions, not I.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.666
To what port do we sail?

06:41.541 --> 06:44.375
See for yourself. We're nearly there.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.291
Nearly where?

06:51.125 --> 06:52.208
Home.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.000
[birds chirping]

07:10.041 --> 07:13.083
[scraping]

07:42.041 --> 07:45.958
[waterfall gushing]

07:46.041 --> 07:47.458
[Halbrand] What is this place?

07:48.916 --> 07:51.166
[Galadriel] There is
only one place it can be.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.916
The Land of the Star.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.458
The westernmost of all mortal realms.

07:58.125 --> 08:02.291
The Island Kingdom of Númenor.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.000
[Elendil] Harbor speed!

08:35.791 --> 08:40.083
[lively chatter]

08:57.916 --> 09:00.041
-[man] Is that an Elf?
-[man 2] See nothin'...

09:01.833 --> 09:05.041
[Galadriel] Since when did Men like me
build kingdoms such as this?

09:05.291 --> 09:07.041
[children laughing]

09:07.125 --> 09:08.958
These Men are not like you.

09:11.083 --> 09:14.791
In the Great War,
your ancestors stood with Morgoth.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.625
These Men stood with the Elves.

09:18.166 --> 09:21.041
As a reward,
the Valar granted them this island,

09:21.125 --> 09:23.125
which has changed much since then.

09:23.208 --> 09:25.500
Do I detect a note of envy?

09:26.416 --> 09:27.833
Not envy.

09:28.416 --> 09:29.541
Sorrow.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.458
Once, Elves came and went
freely from these shores.

09:33.541 --> 09:35.291
Our people were as kin.

09:36.083 --> 09:39.000
Sharing gifts, knowledge.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.708
What happened?

09:40.791 --> 09:42.750
Númenor began to turn away our ships.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.875
In time, they broke off all contact.

09:44.958 --> 09:46.041
Why?

09:47.666 --> 09:49.375
We may be about to find out.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.625
[Elendil] Keep moving.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.333
You would not want to be lost here
without an escort.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.041
[man] Put it with the others.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.500
Too hot.

10:01.708 --> 10:02.833
[clears throat]

10:26.250 --> 10:31.625
-[bell tolling]
-[lively chatter]

10:32.291 --> 10:34.375
[Pharazôn] Patience. Patience.

10:34.916 --> 10:36.916
We are men and women of Númenor.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.500
I suggest we set history aside
for the moment and show some restraint.

10:42.291 --> 10:45.000
Let's try not to antagonize these people.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.416
Captain. The Queen Regent is occupied.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.041
As is Chancellor Pharazôn.
I suggest that you...

11:03.333 --> 11:06.666
[lively chatter continuing]

11:06.750 --> 11:08.125
[crowd murmuring]

11:08.916 --> 11:10.583
[scattered shushing]

11:13.083 --> 11:15.750
[crowd silences]

11:19.416 --> 11:20.416
[whispers] Kneel.

11:20.791 --> 11:22.291
No one kneels in Númenor.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.166
[whispers] Sorry.

11:26.583 --> 11:27.541
[sighs]

11:28.708 --> 11:30.083
Speak, Elf.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.000
Name thyself.

11:37.708 --> 11:39.833
Galadriel of the Noldor.

11:40.833 --> 11:44.375
Daughter of the Golden House of Finarfin.

11:44.458 --> 11:48.500
Commander of the Northern Armies
of High King Gil-galad.

11:53.625 --> 11:54.833
Halbrand.

11:55.666 --> 11:57.541
Of the Southlands.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.416
A Man and an Elf, together?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.208
Circumstances arose that...

12:02.291 --> 12:05.416
We are companions by chance.
Met on the open sea.

12:06.250 --> 12:09.250
Your captain, here,
delivered us from certain death.

12:10.125 --> 12:14.166
All we ask is that Númenor
continue his mercy

12:14.250 --> 12:16.791
and grant us ship's passage
to Middle-earth.

12:16.875 --> 12:20.125
[crowd chattering]

12:20.208 --> 12:22.416
It's been generations
since a ship of Númenor

12:22.500 --> 12:25.375
was permitted to make such a journey
on an Elf's behalf.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.875
It is because of the Elves
that you were given this island.

12:27.958 --> 12:28.958
-[confused chatter]
-What?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.708
Surely you can spare
a few planks and a rudder.

12:32.041 --> 12:34.458
[crowd chattering]

12:35.125 --> 12:37.958
Our ancestors were not given anything.

12:39.666 --> 12:43.125
They paid for this isle
with the blood of their kin.

12:43.208 --> 12:44.458
What the Elf means...

12:44.541 --> 12:47.000
Then if blood be the price of passage,
I will pay it.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.458
[crowd exclaiming]

12:48.541 --> 12:50.500
But one way or another, I will depart.

12:51.416 --> 12:52.916
I welcome you to try.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.291
[Galadriel] I have no need
of your welcome.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.791
[Queen Míriel] And you are quickly
wearing out yours.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.541
-Guards!
-My friends.

13:00.625 --> 13:02.000
[crowd silences]

13:02.083 --> 13:06.208
It seems to me that our leaving
presents some complications.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.333
Perhaps it'd be better if we stayed...

13:09.416 --> 13:13.125
-Stayed?
-Long enough, good Queen,

13:13.208 --> 13:17.500
to give you and your advisors
adequate time to weigh our request.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.125
A few days, perhaps?

13:21.208 --> 13:24.083
[crowd murmuring]

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Three days. And the Elf
is to be restricted to palace ground.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.625
I will not be made a prisoner.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.416
I would sooner knee-cap a stallion

13:33.500 --> 13:36.666
than seek to imprison the mighty commander
of the Northern Armies.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.250
[crowd laughing]

13:38.958 --> 13:41.375
So, you shall be Númenor's guest.

13:48.666 --> 13:49.916
[Halbrand] Captain...

13:52.375 --> 13:53.375
My gratitude.

13:54.708 --> 13:55.791
[grunts]

13:59.875 --> 14:01.375
[chattering]

14:02.416 --> 14:03.791
[whispering] "Good Queen?"

14:04.833 --> 14:07.333
[sighs] The Southlands
will still be there in three days.

14:07.416 --> 14:08.583
[Galadriel] But will its people?

14:08.666 --> 14:10.708
Look around you. This is a paradise.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.208
Ripe with opportunity.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.500
You really expect me to leap with you
back into the furnace?

14:15.583 --> 14:17.833
You leapt into the sea to save one life.

14:17.916 --> 14:19.208
I seek to save many.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.250
I have been searching for my peace
for longer than you know.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.583
Please, for both our sakes,
let me keep it.

14:30.041 --> 14:31.083
[sighs]

14:31.583 --> 14:33.833
Perhaps some peace
would do you good as well.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.833
But at the very least...

14:48.458 --> 14:50.666
do try not to make any new enemies.

14:53.333 --> 14:57.833
[heavy breathing]

15:01.041 --> 15:03.416
It would be wise
to resolve this matter swiftly.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.666
She is but one Elf.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.000
[Pharazôn] An avalanche
can start with one stone.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.833
We dare not invite your father's cloud
back overhead.

15:12.958 --> 15:14.541
Tell me about this captain.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.583
His name is Elendil.

15:17.125 --> 15:21.166
Originally of a noble line,
now a Sea Guardsman with a son,

15:21.250 --> 15:24.625
if memory serves,
set to follow him into the service.

15:26.083 --> 15:27.208
[sail-master] Heave!

15:28.166 --> 15:30.625
Together now!

15:35.958 --> 15:39.291
[waves crashing]

15:40.500 --> 15:41.875
Heave!

15:43.583 --> 15:47.416
You'll have to haul a sheet faster
than that if you want a spot in my guard!

15:48.791 --> 15:51.458
-Come on, cadets!
-[cadets grunting]

15:52.208 --> 15:54.166
Together now!

16:02.875 --> 16:05.000
[woman whispering] Isildur...

16:05.083 --> 16:06.250
[Valandil] Isildur!

16:07.000 --> 16:08.083
Isildur!

16:08.750 --> 16:13.416
[sail-master] Any cadet who earns
their place in the Sea Guard

16:13.500 --> 16:17.000
becomes more than just
Númenor's protector.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.166
Not that one!

16:19.583 --> 16:21.250
[cadets exclaiming]

16:21.333 --> 16:22.750
[sail-master] Imrahil!

16:22.833 --> 16:26.208
Portside! Haul it into portside!

16:27.125 --> 16:29.208
Valandil! Ontamo!

16:32.125 --> 16:32.958
Help! Pull!

16:33.291 --> 16:34.958
[grunting]

16:36.875 --> 16:39.875
[sail-master] Co-ordination, cadets!
Back to it!

16:46.791 --> 16:48.416
[panting]

16:50.166 --> 16:53.708
There is no harsher master than the sea.

17:00.958 --> 17:05.458
[panting]

17:06.500 --> 17:10.750
-[waves splashing]
-[birds chirping]

17:24.583 --> 17:27.750
[horn blows]

17:28.166 --> 17:29.833
[panting]

17:33.083 --> 17:35.500
The sea is always right!

17:36.125 --> 17:38.125
[all] The sea is always right!

17:42.333 --> 17:43.666
[Ontamo] Poor Imrahil.

17:44.416 --> 17:47.416
His father is like to toss him out
on the stones.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.958
[Valandil] Blind luck
Isil's not joining him.

17:51.000 --> 17:51.833
Me?

17:51.916 --> 17:55.166
Your mind was in the bleeding clouds
again all day. What is it?

17:55.250 --> 17:57.458
Just eager to get out there. That's all.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.833
Nine more days. Nine more days!

18:00.916 --> 18:03.916
We pass the Sea Trial, in four years,
we'll make officers.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.833
Ten more, we'll have our own command.

18:05.958 --> 18:07.958
-Mmm. Eight more for me.
-Eighteen maybe.

18:08.041 --> 18:10.166
-[laughter]
-[cadet] Isildur! Your sister's here.

18:15.708 --> 18:16.875
There you are.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.500
[laughs] Berek, my boy.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.750
[Valandil] Look who put down
the sketchbook for once.

18:21.833 --> 18:24.500
Aw, you didn't have to come
all this way just to see me. [groans]

18:24.583 --> 18:26.958
-Isil, cantina?
-Nah, you go.

18:27.041 --> 18:29.541
Come find us later.
Don't be like your brother.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.583
Got your whole life to be an old maid.

18:31.666 --> 18:32.666
Or to be young.

18:32.791 --> 18:33.750
[laughter]

18:33.833 --> 18:36.916
What are you doing here? Where's Father?

18:43.541 --> 18:47.625
[Queen Míriel] The Faithful believe that
when the petals of the White Tree fall,

18:47.708 --> 18:49.375
it is no idle thing,

18:51.083 --> 18:54.000
but the very tears
of the Valar themselves.

18:55.666 --> 18:59.333
A living reminder that their eyes

19:00.833 --> 19:04.708
and their judgment are ever upon us.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.416
Do you believe that?

19:12.500 --> 19:15.041
In my experience,
it is unwise to live one's life

19:15.125 --> 19:17.916
guessing after signs and portents.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.500
[chuckles]

19:21.750 --> 19:25.166
"Elendil." An uncommon name.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.916
From our western shores, is it not?

19:29.250 --> 19:31.416
Mmm. It originates there.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.208
Pray tell, what does it mean?

19:34.541 --> 19:36.125
One who loves the stars.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.625
That is not its only translation, is it?

19:43.041 --> 19:45.250
In the ancient tongue of the Eldar,

19:45.958 --> 19:47.791
it can also mean "Elf-friend."

19:47.875 --> 19:51.125
And are you? An Elf-friend?

19:54.666 --> 19:57.083
I'm a loyal servant of Númenor.

19:57.166 --> 20:00.875
And yet, though Elves
have been unwelcome on our shore

20:00.958 --> 20:03.916
since the reign of my grandfather's
great grandfather,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.333
you chose to break
with that precedent. Why?

20:08.166 --> 20:10.500
It was the sea that put her in my path.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.000
And the sea is always right.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.916
The sea cannot commit treason.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.208
With respect, Queen Regent,

20:24.875 --> 20:28.541
given the circumstances, I did only
what I believed to be most prudent.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.291
If, Elendil, that is truly your wish,

20:35.541 --> 20:39.250
then I shall have to ask you
to perform a service.

20:40.750 --> 20:41.708
[scabbard clinks]

21:13.750 --> 21:15.166
[Orcs grunting]

21:15.250 --> 21:17.541
[woman screaming in distance]

21:22.666 --> 21:23.666
[grumbles]

21:25.125 --> 21:28.291
[groaning]

21:38.333 --> 21:39.208
[grunts]

21:39.541 --> 21:40.958
[woman screaming in distance]

21:42.166 --> 21:44.750
[whispering] These passages
reach all the way to Hordern.

21:46.333 --> 21:47.500
Possibly beyond.

21:48.583 --> 21:51.083
This must be how they escaped
our detection.

21:51.166 --> 21:53.583
And how they shield themselves
from sunlight.

21:53.666 --> 21:55.875
[chains clinking]

21:55.958 --> 21:56.958
[flies buzzing]

21:57.500 --> 21:59.416
They're searching for something.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.625
Some sort of weapon, perhaps?

22:02.708 --> 22:04.000
I do not know.

22:04.708 --> 22:07.041
But they ransack village after village,

22:07.750 --> 22:10.375
toiling nightly to find it
for their leader.

22:10.750 --> 22:13.500
One the Orcs speak of with near-worship,

22:13.583 --> 22:17.041
even reverence,
if Orcs were capable of such a thing.

22:17.541 --> 22:20.041
It seems Morgoth has a successor.

22:20.875 --> 22:21.875
"Adar."

22:24.333 --> 22:27.541
Why would Orcs refer to their leader
by an Elvish word?

22:27.625 --> 22:30.583
[Revion] Sauron was said to have
many names in days of old.

22:30.666 --> 22:32.333
Perhaps this is one of them.

22:32.416 --> 22:35.041
There is more at work here
than we can yet see.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.166
First opportunity either of you has

22:38.250 --> 22:40.500
to get a glimpse above this trench,
you'll take it.

22:40.833 --> 22:42.458
Locate the closest tree line,

22:42.541 --> 22:45.458
and when the sun is at its strongest,
we will make our escape.

22:45.541 --> 22:47.625
If even one of us makes it home,

22:47.708 --> 22:49.458
we can return in force

22:49.541 --> 22:51.375
and sweep the enemy from these lands

22:51.458 --> 22:53.041
-like salt from a table.
-[woman screams]

22:53.125 --> 22:57.791
-[prisoners gasping]
-Sew those lips and dig, Elf!

22:58.375 --> 23:01.000
-These roots block our path.
-[Lurka] Then rip them out.

23:01.750 --> 23:05.833
Rip the whole stinkin' tree down!

23:05.916 --> 23:09.666
Felling a tree will slow our progress.
We shall go around.

23:09.750 --> 23:13.333
Try it, Elf.
And I'll make a map of your back.

23:13.708 --> 23:14.916
[growls]

23:17.166 --> 23:20.833
This tree sprang from the earth
long before you crawled

23:20.916 --> 23:22.916
from whatever wretched place you grew.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.291
It has earned its place in these lands.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.208
[Magrot laughing maniacally]

23:30.291 --> 23:31.666
[Orcs laughing]

23:31.750 --> 23:32.916
[Magrot] Good, Elf.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.958
Very good.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.500
[breathing heavily]

23:39.583 --> 23:41.458
You showed strength.

23:42.375 --> 23:46.750
You just earned your company
a water ration.

23:49.916 --> 23:51.083
Don't be afraid.

23:52.291 --> 23:53.666
Surely you thirst.

24:24.666 --> 24:25.500
[sighs]

24:26.250 --> 24:27.458
[chuckles] There...

24:40.875 --> 24:42.083
[chuckles softly]

24:46.375 --> 24:47.666
[gulps, sighs]

24:55.625 --> 24:56.458
[growls]

24:56.541 --> 24:59.125
[Orcs laughing]

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
[coughs]

25:09.000 --> 25:11.250
[laughing maniacally]

25:24.625 --> 25:26.791
[sighs]

25:26.875 --> 25:28.416
[chuckles]

25:29.250 --> 25:30.916
Tree.

25:31.041 --> 25:33.875
[in Quenya] Húna hravan! Húna hravan!

25:33.958 --> 25:35.166
[Orcs laughing]

25:35.250 --> 25:36.541
[softly in English] I will cut it.

25:38.041 --> 25:39.375
I will cut it down!

25:39.458 --> 25:40.291
[laughter stops]

26:14.625 --> 26:16.750
[in Quenya] Ánin apsene...

26:21.166 --> 26:24.500
[Orcs cheering]

26:33.375 --> 26:35.625
[guard] You will inform Pharazôn
that she's escaped.

26:35.708 --> 26:36.958
I informed him last time.

26:37.041 --> 26:38.291
[guard] That was a dog.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.291
[idle chatter]

26:56.416 --> 26:58.750
[lively chatter]

27:00.708 --> 27:02.791
[Elendil] Be wiser to steal the half-sail.

27:04.375 --> 27:06.875
That skiff will hardly get you
out of the harbor.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.958
I assure you it's an improvement
on my prior mode of passage.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.500
[laughs] Still. Can't let you take it.

27:12.625 --> 27:14.625
I'm afraid the Queen has charged me

27:14.708 --> 27:18.208
with seeing to it that you cause
no further disturbance.

27:18.291 --> 27:20.166
I believe she saw it as a punishment.

27:20.250 --> 27:23.083
Then she and I have something
in common after all.

27:23.166 --> 27:25.333
We both wish you'd never brought me here.

27:26.833 --> 27:29.000
I will take my chances on the skiff.

27:29.541 --> 27:33.333
That would leave me little choice,
but to shout for your minders.

27:34.125 --> 27:37.083
Suppose the words never manage
to escape your throat?

27:38.791 --> 27:40.875
Supposing they did,

27:40.958 --> 27:44.916
you'd be back at the palace in chains,
even further from your destination.

27:45.000 --> 27:50.666
Who is this mortal who speaks to me
as if he has the slightest idea who I am?

27:52.416 --> 27:57.125
I have a daughter who runs fast,
and a son who runs blind.

27:58.958 --> 28:01.625
Your eyes bear
a striking resemblance to both.

28:01.708 --> 28:05.083
Where I run and how I run there
are none of your concern.

28:05.166 --> 28:08.916
Anywhere is better than here,
where I'm hated by all who see me.

28:10.083 --> 28:13.375
So call to your guards,
or get out of my way.

28:14.416 --> 28:18.541
[in Quenya]
You're not hated by all, m'lady.

28:20.291 --> 28:22.875
You speak Elvish?

28:22.958 --> 28:25.041
[in English] Where I was raised,
many speak it.

28:26.041 --> 28:28.375
It is still taught in our Hall of Lore.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.958
Still carved on statues throughout
the city, if you look closely.

28:32.041 --> 28:34.333
Your Hall of Lore, how far is that?

28:34.416 --> 28:35.958
A quarter day's ride.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.333
What is it you seek?

28:40.041 --> 28:41.291
Did you say "ride"?

29:49.083 --> 29:50.708
[hammering]

29:50.791 --> 29:54.875
There is not another man on this isle
that knows this craft better than I.

29:54.958 --> 29:58.666
I will shovel coal if need be,
I'll splinter wood,

29:58.750 --> 30:01.250
I'll shape a sea anchor for you,
free of charge,

30:01.333 --> 30:04.083
sturdier than anything you have ever seen.
How's that?

30:06.833 --> 30:08.500
I'm here to start anew.

30:10.291 --> 30:12.458
Lend me that chance. Please.

30:14.041 --> 30:15.458
And I won't forget it.

30:16.208 --> 30:17.833
You've a stout heart, lad.

30:19.166 --> 30:23.541
But until you've earned your guild crest,
you can't forge steel in Númenor.

30:24.750 --> 30:25.750
[hammering]

30:28.916 --> 30:29.791
[lively chatter]

30:29.875 --> 30:31.125
[Tamar] That's him, isn't it?

30:32.166 --> 30:34.416
The fellow who sailed in with the Elf?

30:35.791 --> 30:37.041
It's you, isn't it?

30:37.666 --> 30:39.625
Certainly appears that way.

30:40.166 --> 30:42.375
-What are you called, again?
-Depends.

30:43.916 --> 30:45.166
Depends on what?

30:46.541 --> 30:47.958
[mouthful] How close we are.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.666
And how close are you and the She-elf?

31:02.291 --> 31:04.291
You're on a lucky streak, low man.

31:04.958 --> 31:07.750
Free sail to our island, eating our food,

31:07.833 --> 31:09.375
drinking our ale...

31:10.291 --> 31:11.958
What will you take next?

31:12.583 --> 31:14.958
Our lands? Our trades?

31:15.041 --> 31:16.666
Don't forget your women.

31:19.666 --> 31:21.375
Look at the mouth on him.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.833
[Tamar] Maybe he and the She-elf
aren't so close after all.

31:29.250 --> 31:33.666
Wager she'd prefer someone
of better breeding.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.375
[mocking laughter]

31:37.375 --> 31:39.958
You're right. You're right.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.791
Here I am.

31:42.875 --> 31:44.541
I'm a guest on your island,

31:44.625 --> 31:47.750
and I haven't shown you
the faintest bit of gratitude.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.250
How 'bout this?

31:51.500 --> 31:53.291
Next few rounds on me!

31:53.375 --> 31:54.750
[all cheering]

31:54.833 --> 31:59.500
[lively chatter, laughter]

32:01.041 --> 32:03.041
You're not so bad, low man.

32:04.541 --> 32:06.625
Well, then, I best make my retreat,

32:06.708 --> 32:09.541
while you've still
got a warm opinion of me.

32:09.625 --> 32:13.208
Men, ladies, anon!

32:13.291 --> 32:17.375
[all cheering]

32:25.541 --> 32:26.416
[metal clinks]

32:27.125 --> 32:28.000
[chuckles]

32:34.125 --> 32:35.291
[Tamar] Hey, low man.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.666
Really thought I wouldn't notice?

32:45.333 --> 32:47.958
Well, I thought it was worth a try.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.791
-[men chuckle]
-Take it.

32:51.958 --> 32:53.208
I don't want any trouble.

32:53.666 --> 32:55.333
[men laughing]

32:55.416 --> 32:57.166
Bit late for that, isn't it?

32:57.791 --> 32:59.208
I believe it is.

33:02.250 --> 33:03.125
[grunts]

33:07.750 --> 33:08.875
[grunting]

33:09.750 --> 33:10.916
[men laughing]

33:12.791 --> 33:13.625
Hmm.

33:15.583 --> 33:16.666
[sighs]

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
-Please. Don't do this.
-[grunts]

33:20.083 --> 33:21.041
[grunts]

33:23.041 --> 33:25.583
-Why not? Low man!
-[groans]

33:26.916 --> 33:30.541
[men laughing]

33:30.625 --> 33:31.958
[screaming]

33:32.041 --> 33:35.750
[men groaning]

33:42.833 --> 33:45.291
-[bone snaps]
-[screaming]

33:45.375 --> 33:46.375
[Tamar] Go.

33:46.791 --> 33:47.875
[shouting]

33:48.458 --> 33:49.708
-[grunts]
-[groans]

33:51.541 --> 33:53.791
[panting] Call me Halbrand.

33:54.083 --> 33:54.958
[groans]

33:56.791 --> 33:57.625
[Tamar coughs]

33:57.708 --> 33:58.916
[man nervously] Over here.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.416
[guards panting]

34:21.666 --> 34:24.583
[Elendil] We're looking for
any information you may have on this.

34:24.666 --> 34:26.333
[loremaster] I will take a look.

34:41.625 --> 34:45.458
You didn't say the Hall of Lore
was assembled by Elros himself.

34:47.666 --> 34:48.875
It is rather remarkable.

34:49.750 --> 34:50.916
[Elendil] Of course...

34:53.375 --> 34:54.625
You knew Elros.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.250
[Galadriel] An uncommon spirit.

34:56.791 --> 34:59.208
But I was always closer with his brother.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.250
[Elendil] Remarkable.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.833
Thank you for bringing me here.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.083
Thank our last king.

35:09.041 --> 35:12.916
It was because of him
this place wasn't torn down.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.541
He was loyal to the Elves?

35:18.708 --> 35:20.250
Is loyal.

35:20.333 --> 35:22.583
We forced him from the throne for it.

35:23.416 --> 35:26.041
They say he spends his days
in the tower now.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.833
An exile in his own kingdom.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.833
There.

35:42.125 --> 35:43.541
What is this?

35:44.166 --> 35:48.750
The account of a human spy
retrieved from an enemy dungeon.

35:50.500 --> 35:53.375
He drew this.
To record the tower's location.

35:57.208 --> 35:59.875
[Galadriel] Wait a moment.
I must be blind.

36:01.750 --> 36:02.833
This is no sigil.

36:08.625 --> 36:09.583
[blazing]

36:10.791 --> 36:12.958
It is a map of the Southlands.

36:14.291 --> 36:15.916
It is as Halbrand said.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.291
And the inscription?

36:19.083 --> 36:20.541
It is the Black Speech.

36:23.916 --> 36:27.125
It speaks not only of a place, but a plan.

36:28.250 --> 36:32.416
A plan by which
to create a realm of their own,

36:33.500 --> 36:38.333
where evil
would not only endure, but thrive.

36:39.250 --> 36:42.500
A plan to be enacted
in the event of Morgoth's defeat...

36:46.000 --> 36:47.166
By his successor.

36:47.666 --> 36:48.791
Galadriel.

36:48.875 --> 36:50.875
[Galadriel] Matters are worse
than I imagined.

36:57.708 --> 37:00.375
Then the Southlands are in grave danger.

37:00.458 --> 37:03.250
If Sauron has indeed returned,

37:04.666 --> 37:08.583
the Southlands are but the beginning.

37:31.791 --> 37:35.333
[muffled laughter echoing]

37:35.416 --> 37:38.500
[rustling]

37:51.791 --> 37:53.958
[muffled laughter echoing]

38:00.250 --> 38:03.666
[muffled laughter, exclaiming]

38:06.666 --> 38:08.333
-[all chanting]
-Nobody goes off-trail.

38:08.416 --> 38:09.958
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

38:10.041 --> 38:11.041
[Sadoc] That's right.

38:11.125 --> 38:12.625
Nobody goes off-trail.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.958
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.958
Nobody goes off-trail.

38:17.041 --> 38:19.833
-Come on. [laughs]
-[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

38:19.916 --> 38:21.833
Nobody goes off-trail.

38:21.916 --> 38:23.791
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.958
Nobody goes off-trail.

38:26.041 --> 38:28.083
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

38:28.750 --> 38:30.708
[Sadoc] Nobody goes off-trail.

38:30.791 --> 38:32.250
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.625
[Sadoc] Nobody goes off-trail.

38:34.708 --> 38:37.458
-[Marigold] So it's not better.
-[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

38:37.541 --> 38:39.625
[Sadoc] Nobody goes off-trail.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.375
[Harfoots] And nobody walks alone.

38:41.458 --> 38:42.708
[Sadoc] Nobody goes off-trail.

38:43.125 --> 38:45.750
We can't carry the cart without you.

38:47.791 --> 38:50.000
We're going to be left behind.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.833
No Brandyfoot has ever been left behind.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.458
[Marigold sniffles]

39:01.958 --> 39:03.875
You know, after I lost Rose,

39:06.166 --> 39:11.000
felt like the wheels broke out
from under me.

39:14.666 --> 39:17.625
And then I saw you in the grass.

39:18.458 --> 39:19.875
Right in this clearing.

39:22.041 --> 39:24.666
-You were so beautiful that day.
-[chuckles]

39:26.083 --> 39:27.833
And in an instant,

39:28.375 --> 39:32.875
-I knew I'd grow old with you, Marigold.
-[laughs]

39:40.083 --> 39:41.791
We'll make it to the Grove.

39:43.458 --> 39:44.708
All of us?

39:46.125 --> 39:47.416
All of us.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.791
How?

39:50.250 --> 39:52.666
I'll stay at the front of the caravan.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.666
And we've got Nori.

39:55.750 --> 39:59.958
No! Look, once that girl
puts her head to somethin',

40:00.333 --> 40:01.208
[sighs]

40:01.958 --> 40:03.375
nothin' can stop her.

40:04.750 --> 40:05.666
[gasps]

40:11.958 --> 40:14.375
[panting]

40:18.958 --> 40:20.958
-[exclaims]
-You lay one paw on that book,

40:21.041 --> 40:23.708
and old Sadoc will use your hide
to make his next batch of pages!

40:23.791 --> 40:26.375
You got a better idea?
The migration's tomorrow.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.166
If you want to help him find those stars,

40:28.250 --> 40:30.166
our best hope is in that book.

40:30.250 --> 40:31.875
I don't want to help him.

40:33.583 --> 40:36.750
He's a giant with a brackish temper,
who sometimes murders fireflies.

40:36.833 --> 40:38.250
That was an accident.

40:38.333 --> 40:41.000
Now, I say the sensible thing to do
is top off his food,

40:41.083 --> 40:44.250
point him to the nearest human village,
and "Fare thee well, stranger."

40:44.333 --> 40:46.625
-That's not where he belongs.
-And where does he belong?

40:46.708 --> 40:50.333
-That's what I'm trying to find out.
-Why's it your problem?

40:51.708 --> 40:54.916
What sense is it sticking your neck out
for him any more than you already have?

40:55.000 --> 40:56.875
There's head-sense, Poppy,
and there's heart-sense.

40:56.958 --> 40:58.791
There's common sense and nonsense.

40:58.875 --> 41:01.750
And if you're all out of the first,
then you can borrow some of mine.

41:01.833 --> 41:04.333
Rather borrow some star charts
out of that book instead.

41:04.416 --> 41:07.625
And you're gonna help me.
Or would you rather I let slip to Malva

41:07.708 --> 41:09.958
it was you who put fireweed
in her toe cream?

41:11.375 --> 41:13.291
-Hmm?
-I'll keep watch.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.333
Go.

41:35.250 --> 41:38.083
[Poppy] Aren't you supposed
to do your speech now, Mr. Burrows?

41:38.166 --> 41:40.166
[Sadoc] Certainly.
I just have to fetch it from my cart.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.916
Oh, good idea. You do that.
Fetch it from your cart!

41:50.375 --> 41:51.750
[grunts]

41:54.041 --> 41:56.750
"Rested legs and full carts"?

41:57.333 --> 41:58.916
[grumbles] No...

42:00.291 --> 42:02.750
Mmm. No, no, no. [sighs]

42:12.750 --> 42:13.666
Ah-ha!

42:14.041 --> 42:15.083
[gasps]

42:15.625 --> 42:18.500
"Full carts and fuller bellies."

42:18.958 --> 42:20.125
[laughs]

42:29.125 --> 42:30.333
Mr. Burrows!

42:30.416 --> 42:31.583
[Sadoc] What is it now?

42:31.666 --> 42:34.666
Oh, no, it's just, um, everyone's waitin'.

42:35.916 --> 42:37.500
Are you all right?

42:38.291 --> 42:40.291
[Sadoc] Yes, yes. Almost done.

42:41.541 --> 42:43.333
How much have you got left?

42:44.708 --> 42:45.666
Just a little left?

42:46.250 --> 42:48.333
Just tell them I'm almost ready.

42:48.416 --> 42:51.458
Right. No! I mean left. Yes. No, I...

42:51.541 --> 42:53.791
I'll tell 'em right now, go straight now.

42:56.166 --> 42:58.958
[Sadoc] Calm yourself,
and get yourself some chestnut pie.

42:59.125 --> 43:00.041
[grunts]

43:00.500 --> 43:03.000
Strange girl, that one. [clears throat]

43:07.583 --> 43:08.958
[panting]

43:10.416 --> 43:13.416
[lively chatter]

43:19.333 --> 43:20.625
[Sadoc clears throat]

43:21.125 --> 43:25.750
Most agreeable, honorable Harfoots.

43:25.833 --> 43:29.541
[Harfoots cheering, laughing]

43:30.333 --> 43:31.291
[chuckles]

43:31.666 --> 43:34.000
Another season has passed in this glade,

43:34.791 --> 43:38.000
leaving us with full carts
and fuller bellies.

43:38.583 --> 43:40.708
Some fuller than most,
if we're being honest about it.

43:40.791 --> 43:42.958
-[exclaims]
-[all laughing]

43:43.041 --> 43:44.666
[Sadoc] Uh, what else...

43:44.750 --> 43:46.250
The Moon is very full,

43:46.333 --> 43:49.291
so be careful where you're having
your shenanigans later on.

43:49.375 --> 43:51.791
It'll be in full view of the entire camp.

43:51.875 --> 43:53.333
And nobody wants that.

43:53.416 --> 43:54.708
[Sadoc laughs]

43:55.041 --> 43:56.666
I'm only jokin' ya.

43:56.750 --> 44:00.333
And now, before we begin our next journey,

44:01.666 --> 44:04.833
we remember those from prior migrations,

44:06.791 --> 44:08.750
-who fell behind.
-[Harfoots] Hear, hear.

44:08.833 --> 44:12.583
And should any Harfoot
fall behind this migration,

44:13.291 --> 44:16.083
they likewise will be carried with us

44:16.166 --> 44:19.000
in our hearts and in our memories.

44:24.583 --> 44:27.666
In life, we could not wait for them.

44:29.625 --> 44:34.625
But here, now, we welcome to our circle...

44:43.541 --> 44:45.000
Miles Brightapple.

44:48.083 --> 44:50.583
Stuck in the snows of the mountain pass.

44:50.666 --> 44:52.166
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

44:56.750 --> 44:58.166
Chance Proudfellow.

45:00.750 --> 45:02.291
Yarrow Proudfellow.

45:04.166 --> 45:07.458
Strap, Dewis,

45:09.333 --> 45:11.041
-Linseed Proudfellow.
-[sniffling]

45:12.875 --> 45:15.541
Taken by landslide one rainy winter day.

45:16.125 --> 45:17.791
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

45:17.875 --> 45:19.125
[sniffling]

45:21.416 --> 45:25.458
[Sadoc continues incoherently]

45:28.166 --> 45:29.708
Daffodil Burrows.

45:31.750 --> 45:32.833
Wolves.

45:32.916 --> 45:35.333
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

45:38.041 --> 45:41.708
[Sadoc] Druda Bumbelly.
She ate the sunshine yellow berries.

45:41.791 --> 45:42.875
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

46:10.708 --> 46:12.291
Blovo Bolgerbuck.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.083
Bees.

46:14.166 --> 46:17.166
[all chuckling]

46:17.250 --> 46:19.583
We all loved him, but he was an ijit.

46:20.583 --> 46:21.958
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

46:24.791 --> 46:28.500
[Sadoc] Ma Hambley.
Was making a sculpture...

46:33.750 --> 46:34.708
[gasps]

46:41.708 --> 46:43.291
[Harfoots] We wait for you.

46:44.791 --> 46:45.666
[grunts]

46:47.750 --> 46:49.625
[grunting]

46:49.708 --> 46:50.916
[clattering]

46:51.000 --> 46:52.125
-[Harfoots exclaiming]
-[gasps]

46:56.958 --> 46:58.875
[Harfoots exclaiming]

47:12.041 --> 47:13.625
[shouting]

47:13.708 --> 47:15.041
[Harfoots screaming]

47:19.958 --> 47:21.916
[shouting]

47:26.833 --> 47:29.500
[panting]

47:31.958 --> 47:33.166
Nori?

47:50.916 --> 47:54.541
[Harfoots murmuring]

47:54.625 --> 47:57.208
[Sadoc] You have lied, stolen,

47:57.291 --> 47:59.916
brought a dangerous outsider
into our midst.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.125
And she lied.

48:01.208 --> 48:03.375
-He already said that.
-Well, she did.

48:03.458 --> 48:06.083
But, no, he was lost. Hurt.

48:06.166 --> 48:08.750
What was I supposed to do?
Leave him there?

48:08.833 --> 48:12.166
You must admit, Sadoc,
it's quite extraordinary.

48:12.250 --> 48:16.125
[stammers] Have you ever heard tell
of beings falling from the stars?

48:16.916 --> 48:19.791
I've heard of beings
who were turned into stars.

48:19.875 --> 48:21.458
Never the other way around.

48:22.500 --> 48:23.708
It's very troubling.

48:23.791 --> 48:25.666
But what about the stars on that page?

48:25.750 --> 48:27.125
What's it say they mean?

48:27.250 --> 48:31.333
Nothin'. The pages are all burnt up.
Why didn't you bother to read them?

48:31.416 --> 48:33.125
I thought we'd have time later.

48:33.208 --> 48:34.541
Who's "we"?

48:36.833 --> 48:40.083
No one. Just me. He's my friend.

48:40.166 --> 48:42.041
[Vilma] We don't need friends, girl.

48:42.833 --> 48:44.166
We need to survive.

48:44.250 --> 48:47.041
Without friends,
what are we surviving for?

48:47.125 --> 48:50.416
"Good little Harfoots,
stick to the path, flee every danger,"

48:50.500 --> 48:53.000
heaven forbid we explore
something new for once!

48:53.083 --> 48:54.791
Elanor Kellamark Brandyfoot!

48:55.833 --> 48:58.333
Our way has kept us alive
a thousand years.

48:59.625 --> 49:01.708
[Malva] Our laws are clear.

49:01.791 --> 49:07.541
Any Harfoot that breaks them
is to be decaravaned.

49:07.625 --> 49:10.875
[Harfoots exclaiming]

49:12.375 --> 49:16.750
Our laws are clear, indeed. But...

49:22.458 --> 49:24.083
Miss Brandyfoot is young.

49:24.708 --> 49:28.416
With as much hair still to grow
on her toes as sense between her ears.

49:29.333 --> 49:31.583
Tomorrow we depart as planned.

49:34.500 --> 49:36.708
And the Brandyfoot cart will be with us.

49:38.208 --> 49:39.083
[Harfoots murmuring]

49:39.166 --> 49:40.833
-At the back of the caravan.
-[Harfoots gasping]

49:40.916 --> 49:42.708
-At the back?
-At the back.

49:42.791 --> 49:45.291
[Largo] Wait, wait, wait a sun-sliver,
now, Sadoc.

49:45.416 --> 49:47.291
We have to talk about this.

49:47.375 --> 49:51.583
Now, you mean the back of the back,
or do you mean the middle of the back?

49:51.666 --> 49:53.416
-[Sadoc] I mean the back.
-[sighs]

49:55.375 --> 49:58.208
You may as well have stamped our name
in the book of the left-behinds.

49:58.291 --> 50:00.083
[gasping]

50:02.416 --> 50:04.333
There's a reason he came to us.

50:05.291 --> 50:06.541
Honestly, Nori.

50:08.083 --> 50:09.875
Do you see a destiny in this?

50:12.000 --> 50:15.625
Do you think the stars reached down
and touched ya, is that it?

50:15.708 --> 50:18.625
Do you think you're special?
You're just a child.

50:20.458 --> 50:22.791
I know I'm not special.

50:23.750 --> 50:27.625
I know I'm just one little Harfoot
in a grand wide world.

50:28.208 --> 50:29.875
But he is special.

50:31.625 --> 50:33.125
I can feel it.

50:36.041 --> 50:37.625
My darlin' girl.

50:39.333 --> 50:41.875
Ever has your heart been
like your father's.

50:43.041 --> 50:46.250
But the tallest milkweed gets snipped.

50:48.125 --> 50:49.541
It's time to pack.

51:05.958 --> 51:06.791
[woman] Oh, no!

51:07.000 --> 51:08.291
-[man laughs]
-[woman] Oh!

51:08.375 --> 51:10.166
-[man] You will die, Queen!
-[woman] Oh, no!

51:10.250 --> 51:13.000
-[man] Oh, no! Galadriel!
-[woman 2] I smite you!

51:13.083 --> 51:15.041
-[man] Oh, no! [groaning]
-[woman 2 laughs]

51:15.125 --> 51:16.333
[woman] Take that!

51:16.416 --> 51:17.625
[Isildur] Galadriel?

51:18.250 --> 51:20.333
The Galadriel? Scourge of the Orcs?

51:20.416 --> 51:23.625
Never mind what she's the scourge of.
Why is she in Númenor?

51:25.416 --> 51:27.583
Waiting for a ship to Middle-earth.

51:28.791 --> 51:33.125
Queen Regent's raised me to Post Captain,
to keep account of her in the meantime.

51:33.208 --> 51:35.500
You brought in an Elf,
so Míriel promoted you?

51:35.583 --> 51:37.458
Who gets to escort her back?

51:37.541 --> 51:39.541
Looking for a promotion, cadet?

51:40.500 --> 51:42.041
Nine days until the Sea Trial.

51:42.125 --> 51:43.291
-[whispers] Tell him.
-You ready?

51:43.916 --> 51:46.833
I'm afraid our northside relations
have taken the liberty

51:46.916 --> 51:49.833
of inviting themselves over
for a feast to see you off.

51:49.916 --> 51:53.125
-Trust that's all right?
-I was thinking I might defer.

51:55.458 --> 51:57.916
-Defer?
-Just for a season, perhaps.

52:00.375 --> 52:01.958
[Elendil] Did you know about this?

52:02.041 --> 52:06.083
Well, I listen to him on occasion,
so, yes, I had my suspicions.

52:06.166 --> 52:07.791
And you didn't bother
telling me about them?

52:07.875 --> 52:10.375
-I'm only thinking about it.
-I was talking to Eärien.

52:10.458 --> 52:12.958
I've been carrying a bit
on my shoulders lately, Father.

52:13.041 --> 52:15.916
Is this really so tragic?
Anárion told me you deferred twice...

52:16.000 --> 52:18.250
Anárion? What's your brother
have to do with this?

52:18.333 --> 52:20.750
-Nothing.
-Well, slightly more than nothing.

52:21.916 --> 52:23.166
Thanks.

52:26.458 --> 52:27.708
Oh, good gods.

52:31.666 --> 52:33.166
I'll tell you what I told him.

52:34.791 --> 52:37.625
There is nothing for us
on our western shores.

52:38.833 --> 52:40.666
The past is dead.

52:41.500 --> 52:44.083
We either move forward or we die with it.

52:46.291 --> 52:47.625
[scoffing]

52:47.708 --> 52:50.916
And do you think it was easy convincing
the sail-master you were up to the task?

52:51.000 --> 52:52.166
I never asked you to do that.

52:52.250 --> 52:54.750
Yes, you did when you got into a scrap
with the Queen's guards.

52:54.833 --> 52:57.166
-They started that!
-Or got thrown out of your horse training.

52:57.250 --> 52:58.458
That wasn't my fault!

52:58.541 --> 53:00.000
Actually, Isil's right, that one wasn't...

53:00.083 --> 53:02.083
-I wasn't talking to you!
-[chattering stops]

53:04.625 --> 53:06.583
-[messenger] Pardon me, Captain.
-What?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.166
Message for your daughter, Eärien.

53:21.916 --> 53:23.541
I know you've doubts, son.

53:26.291 --> 53:30.541
But... But can you not trust that I have
ever your best interest at heart?

53:32.625 --> 53:37.333
The watery part of this world has a way
of healing even the deepest of wounds.

53:38.458 --> 53:40.041
The way it's healed yours?

53:46.166 --> 53:50.250
In nine days' time, when the Sea Trial
begins and that ship launches,

53:50.333 --> 53:51.833
you will be on it.

53:51.916 --> 53:52.750
[sighs]

53:52.833 --> 53:54.875
-[Eärien] Father.
-What is it?

53:56.166 --> 53:57.375
I made apprentice.

53:57.958 --> 54:00.458
I've been accepted to the Builder's Guild.

54:00.541 --> 54:03.666
How? I thought the guild
never reconsidered.

54:03.750 --> 54:05.916
Isildur convinced me to reapply.

54:07.791 --> 54:09.416
Isildur convinced you?

54:12.125 --> 54:15.500
[crowd applauding]

54:15.583 --> 54:18.666
[crowd cheering]

54:25.750 --> 54:27.875
[Galadriel] How fares the quest for peace?

54:29.125 --> 54:30.916
Better than expected.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.291
What happened?

54:33.375 --> 54:34.833
Dispute about a woman.

54:35.458 --> 54:36.750
Halbrand.

54:36.833 --> 54:38.041
Don't start.

54:38.166 --> 54:40.166
You do not belong on this island.

54:40.250 --> 54:44.083
If there's one of us
that doesn't belong here, Elf, it's you.

54:44.208 --> 54:46.166
I'm not so sure of that anymore.

54:46.833 --> 54:48.833
But of one thing I am now certain.

54:50.583 --> 54:52.666
You are more than you claim.

54:52.750 --> 54:54.833
I found this in the Hall of Lore.

55:09.416 --> 55:12.958
That's funny. I found this on a dead man.

55:13.666 --> 55:15.500
Thought the pattern suited me.

55:18.500 --> 55:19.875
Many ages ago,

55:20.791 --> 55:22.958
a man bearing that mark

55:23.041 --> 55:26.750
united the scattered tribes
of the Southlands under one banner.

55:28.041 --> 55:30.958
The very banner that might
unite them again today.

55:31.041 --> 55:34.458
Against the evil that now seeks
to claim their lands.

55:37.125 --> 55:38.541
Your lands, Halbrand.

55:40.666 --> 55:45.166
Your people have no king, for you are him.

55:47.500 --> 55:48.541
[chuckles]

55:48.625 --> 55:51.333
That's an odd thing to say
to a man in a cage.

55:51.416 --> 55:55.666
A cage you have landed in because
you chafe under the rags of the common.

55:56.333 --> 55:59.708
And the armor that ought to rest
upon your shoulders

55:59.791 --> 56:01.208
weighs upon your soul.

56:16.708 --> 56:17.958
Be careful, Elf.

56:19.541 --> 56:22.875
The heir to this mark
is heir to more than just nobility.

56:26.291 --> 56:29.875
For it was his ancestor
who swore a blood oath to Morgoth.

56:31.958 --> 56:33.875
I am not the hero you seek.

56:36.583 --> 56:40.250
For it was my family that lost the war.

56:40.333 --> 56:42.208
And it was mine who started it.

56:43.166 --> 56:44.791
Ours was no chance meeting.

56:45.333 --> 56:47.333
Not fate, nor destiny,

56:48.083 --> 56:50.416
nor any other words Men use
to speak of the forces

56:50.500 --> 56:52.500
they lack the conviction to name.

56:53.458 --> 56:55.791
Ours was the work of something greater.

56:57.083 --> 56:58.333
You must see it.

56:58.416 --> 57:01.166
All I see is an Elf
who won't put down her sword.

57:01.625 --> 57:03.458
Come with me to Middle-earth.

57:04.583 --> 57:07.416
And together we will redeem
both our bloodlines.

57:08.291 --> 57:09.375
How?

57:10.458 --> 57:12.125
You're stuck on this island.

57:13.333 --> 57:15.000
And you're still short an army.

57:16.750 --> 57:18.625
That is all about to change.

57:56.250 --> 57:57.583
It is here, Father.

58:00.041 --> 58:01.625
The moment we feared.

58:04.541 --> 58:06.125
The Elf has arrived.

58:10.041 --> 58:11.125
[Harfoots grunting]

58:16.458 --> 58:18.916
[woman] Off we go! Push! [laughs]

58:19.000 --> 58:20.708

Go on, Poppy, you'll fall behind.

58:46.208 --> 58:47.125
[Largo coughing]

58:47.208 --> 58:50.041
Just give me a moment
to get my breath under me.

58:51.791 --> 58:52.708

58:52.791 --> 58:53.916

59:14.791 --> 59:16.208
-Hey...
-[gasps]

59:20.833 --> 59:22.000
Friend.

59:30.750 --> 59:31.875
[stammers] This is it.

59:33.166 --> 59:36.083
This is how we keep up
with the others, all of us.

59:37.750 --> 59:40.500
He helps us, and we help him.

59:42.333 --> 59:45.125
Can we, Mum? Can we bring him?
