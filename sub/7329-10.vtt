WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:05.282
We can get arrested for this.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.316
Oh, come on.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.884
It's one little Christmas tree.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.886
Why pay, when we can
just cut it down?

00:09.910 --> 00:11.688
Because this is a park.

00:11.712 --> 00:12.689
It's Christmas!

00:12.713 --> 00:14.824
It's illegal.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.327
It's what
our grandparents used to do.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.162
Hey, Lara.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.397
What?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.732
I like this whole
criminal sexy thing.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.834
Stop it!

00:24.858 --> 00:26.570
So, what's it gonna be
this Christmas, huh?

00:26.594 --> 00:28.805
A little naughty or nice?

00:28.829 --> 00:31.241
Dean, wait! Wait!

00:31.265 --> 00:33.199
- Wait.
- What?

00:35.002 --> 00:36.746
Oh, my gosh.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.381
What's he doing?

00:38.405 --> 00:39.916
Hey, mister.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.152
You all right?

00:42.176 --> 00:43.653
Must be freezing.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.907
Sir?

00:46.981 --> 00:48.846
Sir?

00:52.419 --> 00:53.419
Call the police.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.668
Merry Christmas, everybody!

01:31.692 --> 01:33.637
- Loretta, thanks for the ride.
- Bye-bye.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.381
- You drive careful now.
- Have a good time.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.215
Hey, Dad.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.250
Didn't expect you till tonight.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.519
Well, I like my pilots
caffeinated and fresh.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.787
I caught an earlier flight.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.923
Yeah, but you should
have called.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.458
I would have picked you up.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.726
No matter. I made it.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.014
Yeah, you did.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.938
Too many years
since I was here last.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.973
Yeah. Whose fault is that, huh?

02:10.997 --> 02:13.762
We gonna do this again, son?

02:16.003 --> 02:17.265
Come on in.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.684
Old place looks pretty good.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.653
Yeah, well, it could
use a coat of paint.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.202
Couldn't we all?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.230
Well, look at this.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.966
Hope you didn't get all
decked out on my account.

02:35.990 --> 02:40.437
Plenty of comfortable
hotels nearby.

02:40.461 --> 02:44.841
I'll be fine, just as long
as I have a working clicker.

02:44.865 --> 02:45.889
There's the clicker.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.311
No cable.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.770
Color?

02:51.071 --> 02:52.333
I'll manage.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.739
Okay, that's your bed.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.524
What happened to the guest room?

03:00.548 --> 03:01.810
It's not a guest room anymore.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.862
The, uh, the cupboard's
not totally empty.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.365
Maybe I'll cook us something.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.334
Long as it's not your
Stroganoff, knock yourself out.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.451
What's wrong with my Stroganoff?

03:15.629 --> 03:17.641
I'm still surprised
you came, Dad.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.844
It's good to be with family
at Christmas.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.280
Yeah.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.048
You gonna be okay here alone?

03:25.072 --> 03:26.483
I'll be fine, yeah.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.684
You go to work.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.953
Death doesn't take a holiday.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.189
I'll be fine.

03:32.213 --> 03:33.623
Okay.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.726
Leave my number
right here by the phone.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.629
You need anything,
Ericson family

03:39.653 --> 03:41.364
two doors down
same side of the street...

03:41.388 --> 03:42.399
they're always home.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.447
Leroy...

03:46.227 --> 03:48.161
I'm glad to be here.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.846
It's freezing this morning.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.248
Man up, Chilly Willy.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.750
Feel that warm blood
coursing through your veins.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.986
Get in touch with your inner
McGrizzly Adams.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.654
I got hand warmers.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.755
Give me one.

04:05.779 --> 04:06.756
No.

04:06.780 --> 04:07.958
I'm not cold at all.

04:07.982 --> 04:08.959
That's because
you're cold-blooded,

04:08.983 --> 04:11.328
David,
like a lady Komodo dragon.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.663
Ice queen, frigid and deadly.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.166
And I remembered
to wear my thermal underwear.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.000
I'll give you 50 bucks
for it right now.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.435
It wouldn't fit; You're too big.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.171
They'll stretch. Hand them over.

04:21.195 --> 04:22.205
Crime scene gloves.

04:22.229 --> 04:23.607
Triple bag for insulation.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.976
God, there's got to be
a better way to avoid frostbite.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.377
There is. Get to work.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.902
Right. On it, boss.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.017
Marine First Lieutenant
Thomas Ellis.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.586
Married, decorated,
third-generation marine.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.956
Father's a retired marine
colonel, George Ellis, who is

04:39.980 --> 04:41.324
now an ordained minister.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.559
Second career.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.094
Second calling.

04:44.118 --> 04:47.130
Well, his son experienced
the call of the wild.

04:47.154 --> 04:49.099
Going barefoot
and without gloves

04:49.123 --> 04:53.236
in this weather is
ill-conceived, to say the least.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.471
Was not a robbery.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.072
Money and credit cards
are still here.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.308
Not much in the backpack,
except for a towel

04:58.332 --> 05:00.210
and what I think is
some soapy water.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.112
Frozen soap residue
under his fingernails

05:02.136 --> 05:04.714
confirms your discovery.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.449
It's an odd place
to take a bath.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.218
Could have at least
turned around, enjoy the view.

05:08.242 --> 05:10.820
Yeah, if he had,
it might have saved his life.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.223
Recent footprints here

05:13.247 --> 05:15.147
indicate the attacker
came from this direction.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.894
Used a compass.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.829
- It's facing east.
- Why would a marine

05:19.853 --> 05:21.331
not even attempt to fight back?

05:21.355 --> 05:23.755
Lift him up, Duck.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.636
Look under his knees.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.426
Agent McGee,
if you would be so kind.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.288
It is called a sajada.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.790
An Islamic prayer rug.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.160
Well, son of a preacher man
was... Muslim.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.708
He was praying
when he was killed.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.371
As a marine,

06:02.395 --> 06:04.373
Ellis officially changed
his religious status

06:04.397 --> 06:07.009
eight months ago
from Christian to Muslim.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.278
That was clearly
not just a passing interest.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.701
Fruit of the month
might be good.

06:11.805 --> 06:12.849
Maybe a foot massager.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.351
Gee, Tony, never pegged you
as a catalog shopper.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.919
Well, that's 'cause
I'm not, Tiny Tim,

06:16.943 --> 06:19.021
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.190
Took these
from my neighbor's doorstep.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.191
You stole them?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.926
Doorstep's considered

06:23.950 --> 06:24.994
a common area.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.162
I would never steal mail.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.730
That's a federal offense.

06:27.754 --> 06:29.365
Ooh, hold the phone, Malone.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.967
Little bit of lingerie.

06:30.991 --> 06:34.303
Nice. What do you get for
the shrew who has everything?

06:34.327 --> 06:36.139
This for the, um, Secret Santa?

06:36.163 --> 06:37.774
How did I end up
with Delores Bromstead

06:37.798 --> 06:39.142
in Human Resources?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.910
She's a miserable grinch
of a woman.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.812
Can't argue with you there.
Once wished her

06:42.836 --> 06:44.814
a happy Valentine's Day,
she claimed sexual harassment.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.716
- You ever seen her smile?
- No.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.917
Stop it, both of you.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.819
She is a single, middle-aged,
lonely woman.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.087
Have some compassion.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.389
Must be tough living up there
on Mount Crumpit.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.292
Scheming to take Christmas away
from poor Cindy Lou Who.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.960
Why do I bother?

06:57.984 --> 06:59.829
Careful, or I'll take
your present back.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.631
We have a rule, remember?
No presents.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.924
But if I had gotten you one,
you'd be sorry.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.469
DiNozzo desk.

07:06.493 --> 07:07.637
- DiNozzo!
- Hey, boss.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.138
- You know where the Ellises live?
- Uh, n-no.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.239
- Find out.
- Yes.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.474
- Get there.
- I'll meet you there.

07:11.498 --> 07:13.442
- Now.
- Right away.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.278
Gibbs?

07:14.302 --> 07:17.980
Yeah, he wants me to meet him
over at Colonel Ellis's house.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.234
Don't touch my catalogs.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.321
Was it a hate crime?

07:25.345 --> 07:28.090
Don't know yet.
It's a possibility.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.459
How long were you and the
lieutenant married, Mrs. Ellis?

07:30.483 --> 07:33.196
Uh, two years.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.731
Thom had just gotten back
from his second tour,

07:35.755 --> 07:38.901
so we hadn't really spent
any real time together.

07:38.925 --> 07:41.971
Nothing tests a marriage
like the Corps.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.040
Nature of the beast.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.042
I forgot you were a marine,
Agent Gibbs.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.277
I remember you, Colonel.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.012
It's Reverend now.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.681
Why the change?

07:51.705 --> 07:55.664
When my wife died,
I wanted to be closer to God.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.721
Now he's taken my son, as well.

07:58.745 --> 08:01.257
If you don't mind my asking,
Mrs. Ellis,

08:01.281 --> 08:03.025
when did you and Thom meet?

08:03.049 --> 08:05.661
College, here in Maryland.

08:05.685 --> 08:10.366
Um, he swam,
and I played softball.

08:10.390 --> 08:14.070
After he joined the Corps,
things changed.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.538
He, uh...

08:15.562 --> 08:17.673
He started studying the Koran,

08:17.697 --> 08:20.343
and he said it would
make him a better marine.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.644
Within the first year,

08:21.668 --> 08:24.213
though, he was, he was
reciting prayers, and

08:24.237 --> 08:26.865
he was thinking
about converting.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.300
I blame myself for this.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.323
Did I push my beliefs on Thomas?

08:35.347 --> 08:38.059
Was all of this Islamic study
just to spite me?

08:38.083 --> 08:40.296
I asked a friend of mine,

08:40.320 --> 08:44.734
a Muslim Navy chaplain,
to reach out to him.

08:44.758 --> 08:48.271
Maybe he can make some sense
of all this.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.819
Merry Christmas, everyone.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.678
This is my younger son Patrick.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.214
What-What happened?

08:58.238 --> 08:59.238
What's wrong?

09:04.411 --> 09:06.689
Thomas is dead, Pat.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.558
Your brother's gone.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.573
Come here.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.332
Lieutenant, when you knelt
to commune with your maker,

09:16.356 --> 09:19.484
did you have any idea
you'd be seeing him so soon?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.204
I think not.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.541
Is it true that Muslims
pray five times a day?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.510
To be called Muslim, yes.

09:27.534 --> 09:29.879
It's one of the Five Pillars
of Islam.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.714
I don't do anything
five times a day.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.950
Salaat, as it is called,

09:33.974 --> 09:36.652
certainly takes dedication.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.688
Yeah, perhaps

09:38.712 --> 09:42.425
if humanity focused less
on what separates us

09:42.449 --> 09:43.759
from one other

09:43.783 --> 09:46.395
and more on what we could learn
from our differences,

09:46.419 --> 09:48.197
we would stop
killing one another.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.199
That is what I pray for.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.601
You're not the only one, Duck.
What do you got?

09:52.625 --> 09:55.304
Well, I'm waiting for the cleric
until I begin

09:55.328 --> 09:58.341
the autopsy proper,
but cursory examination

09:58.365 --> 10:01.844
indicates blunt force trauma
to the parietal lobe, and

10:01.868 --> 10:04.580
multiple lacerations
to his shoulders and neck.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.681
It's deep.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.483
Yeah, and oddly angled.

10:07.507 --> 10:11.487
The blow was delivered
in a downward slicing motion.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.722
Delivered with what?

10:12.746 --> 10:13.990
Ah, good question.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.025
Whatever it was was cylindrical.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.960
We found paint residue

10:17.984 --> 10:19.695
and some kind of thread
in the wound.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.430
Yeah, well, we'll have
to wait until Abby

10:21.454 --> 10:22.865
is done with her analysis.

10:22.889 --> 10:25.668
However, there is still
much to surmise.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.269
The lieutenant has

10:27.293 --> 10:30.139
minor scratches
on the soles of his feet.

10:30.163 --> 10:34.510
And due to soap traces
on his lower appendages,

10:34.534 --> 10:37.546
it appears that Lieutenant
Ellis cleansed his feet again

10:37.570 --> 10:39.081
before returning to prayer.

10:39.105 --> 10:43.019
Which means he most
likely knew his attacker.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.321
Trusted him enough
to turn his back on him, Duck.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.576
And paid for that
misplaced trust with his life.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.495
Mmm. These chocolates
are delicious.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.829
Hey, Dad.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.198
- I love chocolate.
- Stop making my team fat.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.466
- I'd really like another one.
- Gibbs, why didn't

10:57.490 --> 10:58.667
you tell us your
father was coming?

10:58.691 --> 11:01.137
I didn't think
he'd actually show.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.805
Go ahead.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.240
Have another one, bubble butt.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.642
My metabolism
is slowing with age.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.711
It's nothing a post-holiday
cleanse won't cure.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.714
Come on, it's just candy
for the holidays.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.182
Homemade.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.151
Best in Stillwater.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.853
Ms. Hannigan, huh?

11:17.877 --> 11:19.855
She's been after you
ever since Mom died.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.390
She means well.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.575
Been cooking for me lately.

11:25.985 --> 11:29.198
She does put together
a hell of a care package...

11:29.222 --> 11:30.951
when people are hurting.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.672
Our instincts were right, boss.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.607
The widow did have a fling
while the lieutenant

11:38.631 --> 11:40.743
was overseas with a banker
named James Hanlin,

11:40.767 --> 11:42.211
- from Chevy Chase, Maryland.
- Any recent contact?

11:42.235 --> 11:43.546
Uh, not that I can tell.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.299
Called it off
when the husband found out.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.718
Assalamu alikum.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.120
Wa alikum assalam.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.354
I'm Chaplain El-Sayed.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.039
I'm looking
for Special Agent Gibbs.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.259
Thank you.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.894
Most people don't know
that the marine code

11:58.918 --> 12:02.598
is not unlike the code of Islam,
as written in the Holy Koran.

12:02.622 --> 12:03.732
Honor, courage, commitment.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.102
Same three philosophies
that Islam teaches.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.536
Yet, ignorance and bigotry

12:07.560 --> 12:09.538
remain a problem
in the military.

12:09.562 --> 12:13.375
Well, ignorance isn't unique
to any one group, Agent David.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.378
All we can do is try our best
to educate and pray

12:16.402 --> 12:17.746
for acceptance as a whole.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.715
Lieutenant Ellis...
he find acceptance?

12:19.739 --> 12:24.887
Like many of the Islamic marines
I counsel, Thomas tried,

12:24.911 --> 12:27.756
but opposition
can be overwhelming.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.226
Yet, he stuck with it,
determined to become a Muslim.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.794
Because I think
he found something

12:31.818 --> 12:33.295
that was missing in his life.

12:33.319 --> 12:37.633
Thomas referred to his awakening
as a devout epiphany.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.236
That's when he became
Tareef Bashir.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.370
Yes.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.472
And how did the rest
of his unit react to

12:43.496 --> 12:44.773
his conversion?

12:44.797 --> 12:47.977
Well, some were open to it,
others not so much.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.346
They found his need
to pray multiple times a day

12:50.370 --> 12:51.747
inopportune and dangerous.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.850
Was any one marine more vocal
about it than any other?

12:54.874 --> 12:56.352
Thomas did ask me

12:56.376 --> 12:59.922
to personally speak to
a First Sergeant Louis Tibbens.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.624
Successful?

13:01.648 --> 13:05.828
Well, let's just say that
some battles can never be won.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.496
Spoke to Ellis's C.O.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.198
He was on vacation
with his family,

13:09.222 --> 13:11.033
but he did confirm
that Tibbens and Ellis

13:11.057 --> 13:12.158
did not get along.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.271
Louis Tibbens, home on leave.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.338
Athens, West Virginia.

13:16.362 --> 13:17.706
900.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.275
Bigger than Stillwater.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.043
But does it have the charm?

13:21.067 --> 13:22.978
Or the perpetual smell of coal?

13:23.002 --> 13:25.129
I always liked that smell.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.222
Keep going.

13:33.246 --> 13:34.323
Yes, uh...

13:34.347 --> 13:37.393
no criminal priors, boss,
uh, but Tibbens does have

13:37.417 --> 13:40.462
two NJPs for being disrespectful
to a superior officer.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.200
Tony, you and Ziva
find Tibbens. McGee?

13:44.224 --> 13:46.936
Look into Ellis's Muslim life.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.504
As Tareef Bashir?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.739
Let's see if two names
means he's leading two lives.

13:50.763 --> 13:54.009
How the hell can you sit
like this all day?

13:54.033 --> 13:55.144
No, I'm serious.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.512
You'd think,
after all these years,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.048
they'd give you a couple walls,
some privacy.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.716
Come on. Got a job for you.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.817
Where are we going?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.619
It's a surprise.

14:03.643 --> 14:04.887
Here.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.622
You're building toys.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.524
Wow.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.658
No.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.513
We're building toys.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.316
So, when did you get
into the spirit?

14:16.723 --> 14:19.401
Oh, I don't know.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.869
For me,
it's more about the wood.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.953
Though having that deadline
of the 24th has been good.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.400
You don't believe in Santa,
but you believe in hobbies.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.695
As long as you believe
in something, I guess.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.883
Settles my mind, Dad.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.306
Keeps my hands busy.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.356
So, you want me
to finish all this,

14:40.380 --> 14:41.790
paint it
and put it together, huh?

14:41.814 --> 14:42.891
If you want.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.193
It's up to you.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.962
If it settles my mind.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.564
You want to let those kids down

14:48.588 --> 14:50.432
at the children's hospital,
go right ahead.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.001
You're trying to Tom Sawyer me

14:52.025 --> 14:53.890
into whitewashing a fence
for you.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.139
No, not for me.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.425
With me.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.232
If you feel up to it.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.103
Go to work.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.586
There's a steak in the fridge.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.087
We'll talk when I get back.

15:12.111 --> 15:14.456
Yeah, yeah.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.505
Hey, Dad.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.963
I mean that.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.080
Okay.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.944
If Santa's looking

15:35.968 --> 15:38.402
for Rudolph,
think I know what happened.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.151
Tibbens' sister described
this place perfectly.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.486
So this is where a red throat
would hang out

15:44.510 --> 15:46.522
after being overseas for months.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.290
It's not "red throat,"
it's redneck.

15:48.314 --> 15:49.658
And I think we found

15:49.682 --> 15:51.660
the entire cast of Hee Haw.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.162
Over there.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.287
That's him.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.535
With his brother Darryl
and his other brother Darryl?

16:02.061 --> 16:03.460
First Sergeant Tibbens.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.010
Call me Tibbs.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.012
They call you Mr. Tibbs?

16:10.036 --> 16:11.180
Who the hell are you?

16:11.204 --> 16:13.215
NCIS.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.817
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.051
This is
my probationary sidekick,

16:16.075 --> 16:18.053
Agent Ziva David.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.688
What's the problem?

16:19.712 --> 16:21.290
Thomas Ellis. He's dead.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.958
Allah didn't save his ass, huh?

16:22.982 --> 16:26.628
Guess he should have gone back
to Iraq, where he belonged.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.630
Where were you at dawn
this morning?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.032
Why, do I need an alibi?

16:30.056 --> 16:31.133
Couldn't hurt.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.302
I was in a hunting blind.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.504
With these two.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.406
Can you prove it?

16:37.430 --> 16:40.843
Got a six-point buck
in the bed of my pickup.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.178
How's that for proof?

16:43.202 --> 16:45.114
But I bet a pretty little thing

16:45.138 --> 16:47.273
like you never killed
nothing before, huh?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.852
I'll never tell.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.553
Oh, boy.
Uh, you're going to have

16:51.577 --> 16:53.489
to come down to NCIS with us.
Come on.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.591
Got a better idea.

16:55.615 --> 16:59.061
How about this one comes back
to my place and...

16:59.085 --> 17:00.963
decorates my tree?

17:00.987 --> 17:01.964
Oh, no.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.198
Happy Hanukkah.

17:03.222 --> 17:04.689
Now, let's go.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.537
Ziva, no!

17:08.560 --> 17:10.050
Easy, easy. Heel.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.907
Sit down.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.544
My turn.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.227
Red throats.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.396
Rednecks.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.597
Whatever.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.680
What people believe in
is their own business.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.315
But the brass knows having

17:53.339 --> 17:57.070
a devout Muslim riding patrols
could blow up in our faces.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.289
Really? Why?

18:00.313 --> 18:02.058
Hajis think

18:02.082 --> 18:04.493
when a white marine
starts reciting the Fatiha,

18:04.517 --> 18:07.229
he's mocking them,
and they hate him for it.

18:07.253 --> 18:11.233
And they hate us even more,
so we get concerned.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.070
You get concerned...
enough to kill?

18:14.094 --> 18:15.571
Wasn't me.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.841
So, if it wasn't you,
who was it, then?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.743
He knows something.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.711
Could be anyone.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.080
Who?

18:24.104 --> 18:25.214
Look, somebody out there

18:25.238 --> 18:27.149
felt strong enough
to offer us money...

18:27.173 --> 18:31.020
good money... to get Ellis
to quit the Corps for good.

18:31.044 --> 18:35.024
So someone paid you guys
to be bigots?

18:35.048 --> 18:37.860
It was for the safety
of the unit.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.995
So somebody offered you money.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.010
Who?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.368
Don't know.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.571
Traveled word of mouth.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.440
We answered to a PO box,
got wired the money.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.455
No questions asked.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.712
Oh, my God.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.572
Remember freshman year...
Miss Santa?

19:03.143 --> 19:04.720
Abby?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.822
McGee, you're here.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.057
Hey, got any, uh, specifics

19:08.081 --> 19:09.592
on the metal we pulled
from Ellis's wound?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.393
It's, uh... mass spec's
working on it as we speak.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.695
But there's someone
you have to meet.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.163
This is one of my
very bestest friends

19:14.187 --> 19:16.332
in the whole world.
We went to college together,

19:16.356 --> 19:18.834
and she's the lab tech
over at the VA now.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.202
Carol Wilson,
Special Agent McGee.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.504
How goes it, McGee?

19:21.528 --> 19:22.654
Goes great.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.308
Much better than this guy.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.768
Santa... I don't know why he did
the LAP-BAND. I told him not to.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.947
Well, you know, Santa...

19:31.971 --> 19:33.516
can't have a LAP-BAND, you know.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.850
He's got to be...

19:34.874 --> 19:35.918
Doesn't work.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.753
- What are you drinking?
- Um, Caf-nog.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.488
It's an old family recipe.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.348
Speaking of families... tell him.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.365
This is my nephew Fisher.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.834
How cute is he?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.669
His mother, my sister,
is stationed

19:53.693 --> 19:55.538
on a naval destroyer
in the Indian Ocean.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.174
Fisher has been staying
with Carol until she gets back.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.875
I took Fisher to the mall today.

19:59.899 --> 20:03.279
Watched as kid after kid sat
on some lame-ass Santa's lap

20:03.303 --> 20:05.314
and asked for toys, video games.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.949
But not Fisher.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.184
All Fisher asked for

20:08.208 --> 20:11.120
was to see his mom
on Christmas Eve.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.988
On a destroyer?

20:13.012 --> 20:16.683
Yeah, so...
we thought you could help.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.564
Look, I sympathize, okay,

20:21.588 --> 20:23.332
but satellite feeds
to the Indian Ocean

20:23.356 --> 20:25.568
are restricted to all but

20:25.592 --> 20:26.902
the highest priority
communications.

20:26.926 --> 20:30.039
What's a higher priority
than a little boy

20:30.063 --> 20:32.122
that wants to see
his mom on Christmas?

20:32.899 --> 20:37.213
McGee... he's, like,
a miracle worker.

20:37.237 --> 20:40.149
If anyone can do this, he can.

20:40.173 --> 20:41.401
Right, McGee?

20:45.378 --> 20:47.056
Boss, I've been
running bank records

20:47.080 --> 20:48.891
on each marine in Ellis's unit.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.926
So far, only two marines,

20:50.950 --> 20:52.061
including
First Sergeant Tibbens,

20:52.085 --> 20:53.762
accepted a bribe...
four grand apiece.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.564
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.866
All the money was drawn
from the same overseas account

20:57.890 --> 20:59.368
and deposited
around the same time.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.369
It's a dummy corp.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.770
Interpol is checking into it.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.172
Tell them to check faster.

21:03.196 --> 21:04.629
You do it.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.544
Not you, boss. You.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.546
I mean, how many languages
do you speak, anyway?

21:10.570 --> 21:12.572
Including the language
of love, ten.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.984
Yeah. Gibbs.

21:15.008 --> 21:16.051
You have to come home.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.119
- Dad, I can't.
- I need you here.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.354
I almost burned your house down.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.437
You did what?!

21:25.451 --> 21:26.695
Sir, everything's okay.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.863
Hey, guys.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.732
- Thanks.
- No problem.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.568
Dad... you okay?

21:32.592 --> 21:35.237
When was the last time
you-you cleaned that flue?

21:35.261 --> 21:37.195
The damn fireplace
was all clogged.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.613
What is all this?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.127
Boxes.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.619
Decorations?

21:50.643 --> 21:51.787
They're your mom's stuff.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.989
No use leaving them at home.

21:54.013 --> 21:57.092
I had them shipped for the tree.

21:57.116 --> 22:00.029
It's a beauty, isn't it?

22:00.053 --> 22:02.865
Yeah, yeah, it's good,
it's fine.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.634
Will you please
stop patronizing me?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.837
If you don't like
what I'm doing, speak up.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.707
Dad, I am trying
to make this work.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.790
And I'm not?

22:21.282 --> 22:23.818
Will you please put that box
in another room?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.688
I don't like
being around what's in it.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.523
It's secure.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.538
It's dangerous!

22:30.983 --> 22:32.828
Why won't you do what I ask?

22:32.852 --> 22:36.899
How come everything with you
ends up in an argument?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.534
For just once,

22:38.558 --> 22:42.071
will you listen
to what I'm asking you?!

22:42.095 --> 22:43.906
All right.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.397
All right, I'll move it.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.813
I'm going for a walk.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.515
You want some company?

22:53.539 --> 22:55.274
I'm all right. I'm fine.

22:59.645 --> 23:00.723
Yeah. Gibbs.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.191
Spoke to Interpol, boss.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.360
Got the account that was paying
those guys to pressure Ellis.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.361
Got a name?

23:05.385 --> 23:07.596
Colonel George Ellis.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.952
His father?

23:25.692 --> 23:28.804
How dare you guys come in here
and accuse a decorated marine...

23:28.828 --> 23:30.472
a reverend, no less...

23:30.496 --> 23:31.940
of hurting his own son.

23:31.964 --> 23:32.941
It's a fact.

23:32.965 --> 23:34.343
It's a lie.

23:34.367 --> 23:35.477
Not according to the bank.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.179
People do things
for such misguided reasons.

23:37.203 --> 23:40.115
Well, marines aren't
just people, sir.

23:40.139 --> 23:43.118
You're right, Pat, they're not,
but they abide by the same laws.

23:43.142 --> 23:44.820
- Your father didn't.
- Tina,

23:44.844 --> 23:46.288
we need to get in touch

23:46.312 --> 23:48.123
with James Hanlin.
You have his number, right?

23:48.147 --> 23:49.525
I mean, I understand.

23:49.549 --> 23:51.694
You needed a shoulder to cry on
and he was happy to talk,

23:51.718 --> 23:52.961
among other things.

23:52.985 --> 23:54.029
Where were you the morning.

23:54.053 --> 23:55.631
- Thom was killed?
- With friends.

23:55.655 --> 23:57.232
And Patrick was at school.

23:57.256 --> 23:58.734
Why are you doing this?

23:58.758 --> 23:59.968
Because you're not
being straight with us.

23:59.992 --> 24:01.804
It's okay, Tina.

24:01.828 --> 24:04.490
They have a right
to know everything.

24:10.370 --> 24:12.047
You're correct, Agent DiNozzo,

24:12.071 --> 24:13.849
but I didn't want him
discharged.

24:13.873 --> 24:16.752
I just wanted
this Muslim nonsense to end.

24:16.776 --> 24:19.355
You paid off the men
he trusted with his life.

24:19.379 --> 24:22.358
Because I thought if Thom knew
he was putting them in danger,

24:22.382 --> 24:25.249
he would stop being selfish.

24:28.421 --> 24:33.035
What I did was wrong,
but well-intentioned.

24:33.059 --> 24:37.706
And if it led to my son's death,
then God forgive me.

24:37.730 --> 24:40.175
And Thom's God, too.

24:40.199 --> 24:42.030
One and the same, Colonel.

24:44.937 --> 24:47.583
Do you really think the colonel
was involved in his son's death?

24:47.607 --> 24:49.184
Well, he has a congregation.

24:49.208 --> 24:51.811
Humiliation can do
irrational things to people.

24:52.912 --> 24:54.189
DiNozzo.

24:54.213 --> 24:55.758
Agent DiNozzo,
this is Delores Bromstead...

24:55.782 --> 24:56.759
It's her.

24:56.783 --> 24:58.394
From Human Resources.

24:58.418 --> 24:59.528
Hi, Delores.

24:59.552 --> 25:00.696
- Is something wrong?
- No, I...

25:00.720 --> 25:02.064
I just, I have a cold.

25:02.088 --> 25:03.756
Delores.

25:04.757 --> 25:05.901
Human Resources, the grinch.

25:05.925 --> 25:07.069
Watch, watch, watch.

25:07.093 --> 25:08.704
This is gonna be really good.

25:08.728 --> 25:09.772
You crack me up. That is...

25:09.796 --> 25:11.240
- Not funny. My office...
- No, it's not...

25:11.264 --> 25:12.374
- That's not funny.
- Be there.

25:12.398 --> 25:13.475
Of course I'll be there.

25:13.499 --> 25:14.910
With bells on.

25:14.934 --> 25:16.478
- Big silver bells.
- Yeah, good-bye.

25:16.502 --> 25:18.438
Okay.

25:19.505 --> 25:20.940
Someone broke my cover.

25:22.108 --> 25:25.521
She knows I'm her Secret Santa.

25:25.545 --> 25:27.823
McGee, you wouldn't do that.

25:27.847 --> 25:29.542
Ho-ho-ho.

25:30.950 --> 25:34.163
She wants me to meet her
at 6:00 on Christmas Eve.

25:34.187 --> 25:35.264
To exchange gifts?

25:35.288 --> 25:36.999
To wrap me in a cocoon of ivy

25:37.023 --> 25:39.668
and suck the Christmas joy
out of me.

25:39.692 --> 25:41.036
Okay, I'm going
to say this again.

25:41.060 --> 25:42.104
She is probably

25:42.128 --> 25:43.839
someone who just lacks
social skills,

25:43.863 --> 25:46.141
so be nice,
get her something special,

25:46.165 --> 25:47.810
kill her with kindness.

25:47.834 --> 25:49.812
Or with a stake of holly
through the heart.

25:49.836 --> 25:51.146
What should I get her?

25:51.170 --> 25:52.281
David.

25:52.305 --> 25:54.283
Ziva, meet me in Abby's lab.

25:54.307 --> 25:56.185
All right.

25:56.209 --> 25:59.087
Any of these things could kill,
but none of them did.

25:59.111 --> 26:00.856
Any luck I.D.'ing
the murder weapon?

26:00.880 --> 26:02.825
This job is not about luck.

26:02.849 --> 26:04.259
It's about the keen eye
of science.

26:04.283 --> 26:05.761
Abby.

26:05.785 --> 26:07.596
Would I have called you down
here if I didn't have something?

26:07.620 --> 26:09.144
Hold that thought.

26:18.498 --> 26:21.310
Go ahead, taste one.

26:21.334 --> 26:23.666
I'm sorry, Abby,
I could never eat you.

26:25.004 --> 26:26.482
I'll take one to go.

26:26.506 --> 26:28.350
For my dad.

26:28.374 --> 26:30.018
- Aw.
- Abbs, I hope you have

26:30.042 --> 26:32.087
something more than
a gingerbread cookie.

26:32.111 --> 26:35.357
Yeah, I have aluminum
and titanium.

26:35.381 --> 26:37.960
I found minute particles in
Lieutenant Ellis's head wound.

26:37.984 --> 26:39.595
How about a baseball bat?

26:39.619 --> 26:40.899
That's a very good guess, Gibbs.

26:42.388 --> 26:45.667
So I used the angle of impact,
the depth of the wound

26:45.691 --> 26:47.636
and the density of bone
to work my way backwards

26:47.660 --> 26:48.804
to simulate the kill.

26:48.828 --> 26:50.305
Ho-ho-ho!

26:50.329 --> 26:51.440
What's that?

26:51.464 --> 26:52.375
- On Dasher...
- Oh.

26:52.399 --> 26:53.642
Oh, you weren't supposed to...

26:53.666 --> 26:55.811
Merry Christmas! ...See that.

26:55.835 --> 26:57.346
Um, okay, here.

26:57.370 --> 26:58.780
So check out the death blow.

26:58.804 --> 27:00.415
It's the speed
at which it impacts.

27:00.439 --> 27:02.284
Ellis's skull
that's what's impressive.

27:02.308 --> 27:04.019
Watch this.

27:04.043 --> 27:06.555
Whoever killed Lieutenant Ellis
was definitely athletic

27:06.579 --> 27:08.672
and knew how to generate
some serious momentum.

27:11.918 --> 27:14.062
Mrs. Ellis,

27:14.086 --> 27:16.732
your father-in-law said
you were here.

27:16.756 --> 27:18.433
I wanted to see
where it happened.

27:18.457 --> 27:19.768
I'm Agent David from NCIS.

27:19.792 --> 27:20.802
I hope you don't mind.

27:20.826 --> 27:22.037
Can we talk?

27:22.061 --> 27:23.338
What could you possibly ask me

27:23.362 --> 27:24.773
that your friends
don't already know?

27:24.797 --> 27:26.975
Look, I know we have
brought up some personal issues.

27:26.999 --> 27:29.611
The affair you had while
your husband was overseas...

27:29.635 --> 27:32.014
did he know about it?

27:32.038 --> 27:34.016
Eventually.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.151
He knew that James and I
were good friends.

27:36.175 --> 27:37.753
You are in excellent shape, yes?

27:37.777 --> 27:40.589
Agent David,
what is the purpose of this?

27:40.613 --> 27:43.025
Do you still play softball?

27:43.049 --> 27:44.760
- I'm sorry?
- Your husband...

27:44.784 --> 27:46.995
he was killed by a blow to
the head, possibly by a bat.

27:47.019 --> 27:49.097
The angle of the blow
was unique.

27:49.121 --> 27:51.833
And you think that I did it?

27:51.857 --> 27:54.036
Well, you returned
to the crime scene.

27:54.060 --> 27:57.406
Look... I have
a funeral to plan.

27:57.430 --> 28:00.442
A military funeral for a hero

28:00.466 --> 28:03.435
and a husband that
I loved very deeply.

28:05.104 --> 28:07.095
Now, if you'll excuse me.

28:10.710 --> 28:11.687
And by...

28:11.711 --> 28:13.088
by the time I got there,

28:13.112 --> 28:15.290
Leroy had fallen asleep

28:15.314 --> 28:18.618
and left the gate unlocked.

28:24.890 --> 28:27.120
I don't remember
what happened next.

28:28.894 --> 28:31.773
Well, I spent the next 25 hours

28:31.797 --> 28:35.277
trying to round up
26 missing sheep.

28:35.301 --> 28:36.511
That's right.

28:36.535 --> 28:38.080
- Hello, Jethro.
- That's right.

28:38.104 --> 28:42.084
Your father has been regaling me
with stories of his youth.

28:42.108 --> 28:43.619
We have a lot in common.

28:43.643 --> 28:45.287
Naive heartbreak,

28:45.311 --> 28:46.822
tales of adolescent...

28:46.846 --> 28:49.391
chivalry.

28:49.415 --> 28:52.494
Oh, oh, and fond memories

28:52.518 --> 28:55.112
of skinny-dipping as children.

28:56.122 --> 28:58.100
- Duck.
- Uh?

28:58.124 --> 29:00.102
Come on, getting late.

29:00.126 --> 29:02.137
Oh, yeah, time to go.

29:02.161 --> 29:04.139
Yes, there is
Christmas shopping to be done

29:04.163 --> 29:06.265
and a roose to be goasted.

29:07.633 --> 29:09.578
A goose to be roasted.

29:09.602 --> 29:11.713
Ah, a pleasure
to finally meet you.

29:11.737 --> 29:14.282
Pleasure is all mine.

29:14.306 --> 29:16.342
Where's my coat?

29:22.281 --> 29:23.659
Okay.

29:23.683 --> 29:25.560
What a sweet,
lovely man, Jethro,

29:25.584 --> 29:28.296
and certainly much warmer
than you depicted him.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.667
And in many ways,
more accessible than you are.

29:31.691 --> 29:33.669
Duck, please.

29:33.693 --> 29:34.703
My dad?

29:34.727 --> 29:36.238
Well, you understand
I cannot make

29:36.262 --> 29:40.776
a firm diagnosis on the basis
of such a short meeting.

29:40.800 --> 29:45.066
But... there is most
definitely something wrong.

29:46.238 --> 29:47.683
Well, how bad?

29:47.707 --> 29:49.618
That's an interesting question.

29:49.642 --> 29:54.156
I doubt what you experienced
was any kind of dementia.

29:54.180 --> 29:56.158
I mean, despite
his disorientation,

29:56.182 --> 29:57.359
your father shows

29:57.383 --> 30:00.195
no signs
of impaired recognition,

30:00.219 --> 30:02.798
has no trouble solving problems.

30:02.822 --> 30:06.034
He certainly doesn't have
any symptoms of motor aphasia.

30:06.058 --> 30:07.869
Well, what the hell
is wrong with him?

30:07.893 --> 30:11.897
Something far more
old-fashioned, I believe.

30:13.232 --> 30:15.811
Your father... is under

30:15.835 --> 30:19.247
significant emotional distress,

30:19.271 --> 30:22.551
the kind one sees when
one loses a loved one or...

30:22.575 --> 30:25.387
I mean, has he experienced
any kind of trauma recently?

30:25.411 --> 30:27.389
Well, it's nothing
personal, Jethro,

30:27.413 --> 30:29.224
but I don't think he came here

30:29.248 --> 30:31.093
for your uplifting
holiday cheer.

30:31.117 --> 30:34.062
Martha Stewart you are not.

30:34.086 --> 30:36.498
Why'd he come?

30:36.522 --> 30:39.401
Well, the answer to that
question is not in my purview.

30:39.425 --> 30:43.171
You are, when all is said
and done, the investigator.

30:43.195 --> 30:46.575
I prescribe
some phone calls back home

30:46.599 --> 30:49.377
on your father's behalf.

30:49.401 --> 30:52.859
They just might prove
enlightening.

30:56.275 --> 30:57.486
Okay, so you're telling me

30:57.510 --> 31:00.222
that Ensign Blake
cannot be reached on board?

31:00.246 --> 31:01.223
Well, you know what?

31:01.247 --> 31:02.591
This is an emergency.

31:02.615 --> 31:07.028
I have direct orders from
Admiral... Nicholas Whitebeard.

31:07.052 --> 31:09.531
Yes, yes, that is his name.

31:09.555 --> 31:12.768
He's the admiral that oversees
the Northern Polar regions.

31:12.792 --> 31:14.870
Great.

31:14.894 --> 31:16.872
Okay, get back to me
as soon as possible, please.

31:16.896 --> 31:18.240
Thank you.

31:18.264 --> 31:20.108
Misplaced tidings of joy,
McScrooge?

31:20.132 --> 31:24.479
I'm donating my time to a very,
very worthy charity this year.

31:24.503 --> 31:26.548
- How worthy?
- Very.

31:26.572 --> 31:28.483
Who are you doing
this favor for, McGee?

31:28.507 --> 31:31.820
Abby, her friend
and the big man.

31:31.844 --> 31:33.155
Gibbs?

31:33.179 --> 31:34.756
- Nope.
- Director Vance?

31:34.780 --> 31:36.615
Bigger. And rounder.

31:38.384 --> 31:39.728
DiNozzo.

31:39.752 --> 31:41.754
Yes, sir.

31:44.089 --> 31:45.886
Got it, yeah.

31:47.126 --> 31:50.172
That was Director Vance.
He just spoke with SECNAV.

31:50.196 --> 31:52.707
Colonel Ellis was visiting
his Chesapeake Bay home

31:52.731 --> 31:54.309
at the time
the lieutenant was killed.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.077
SECNAV's house?

31:56.101 --> 31:58.413
Yep.

31:58.437 --> 32:00.282
- And the daughter-in-law?
- She drove him.

32:00.306 --> 32:01.983
Thom stayed home.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.919
Well, that is an airtight alibi.

32:03.943 --> 32:05.487
So we have nothing.

32:05.511 --> 32:06.555
In a manner of speaking.

32:06.579 --> 32:08.490
All I want for Christmas
is a clue trail.

32:08.514 --> 32:10.659
I must see Special Agent Gibbs.

32:10.683 --> 32:12.494
Chaplain El-Sayed.

32:12.518 --> 32:13.695
We have a problem.

32:13.719 --> 32:15.983
I just got this in the mail.

32:31.303 --> 32:34.616
The letter came through
the military postal service.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.719
So it could have been dropped
in a box on any base.

32:37.743 --> 32:39.721
By someone who has
easy access to you.

32:39.745 --> 32:41.489
So you think the threat is real?

32:41.513 --> 32:44.326
Or a distraction,
if we're getting too close.

32:44.350 --> 32:46.318
NCIS will provide protection.

32:47.519 --> 32:48.630
That won't be necessary.

32:48.654 --> 32:50.165
You have a wife and a daughter.

32:50.189 --> 32:53.034
Whom I love very much,
but I am also a Navy chaplain,

32:53.058 --> 32:54.736
a man of honor and pride.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.304
Bullheaded stubbornness.

32:56.328 --> 32:57.472
Look, as much as I am here

32:57.496 --> 32:58.840
to pray for the injured
and the dying,

32:58.864 --> 33:02.143
I am also here
to open the minds of people.

33:02.167 --> 33:03.845
To help them
to understand the beauty

33:03.869 --> 33:05.380
and strength of Islam.

33:05.404 --> 33:07.582
You talk to teenagers, Chaplain?

33:07.606 --> 33:10.652
Yes, before society dictates for
them what is and isn't moral.

33:10.676 --> 33:12.320
You see, in the Muslim religion,

33:12.344 --> 33:15.223
the most immoral thing
a person can do is to not

33:15.247 --> 33:18.560
accept someone who lives by
the Pillars of Islamic belief.

33:18.584 --> 33:20.228
So, a while back,
Thomas asked me

33:20.252 --> 33:22.063
to speak to his brother's
prep school class.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.833
So you spoke with Patrick Ellis?

33:24.857 --> 33:26.601
I did.

33:26.625 --> 33:28.703
And let me just say,
it is amazing

33:28.727 --> 33:31.252
how two siblings can be
so very different.

33:34.366 --> 33:35.810
How fun would it be

33:35.834 --> 33:37.646
to have a totally impromptu
Christmas party,

33:37.670 --> 33:38.914
like, right now?

33:38.938 --> 33:40.582
We could decorate
my test-tube tree,

33:40.606 --> 33:43.218
we could warm up dumplings
in the incubator.

33:43.242 --> 33:44.419
Abby!

33:44.443 --> 33:46.054
I know. Typing.

33:46.078 --> 33:47.489
I feel like Scrooge
being visited

33:47.513 --> 33:48.623
by the three grumpy ghosts.

33:48.647 --> 33:50.659
You want to see
the attack again, right?

33:50.683 --> 33:52.794
The point of impact.

33:52.818 --> 33:57.098
Like I said, whoever did this
had agility, speed and power

33:57.122 --> 33:58.099
on their side.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.701
Well, if I don't mind saying so,

33:59.725 --> 34:02.103
I have many of those
qualities myself.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.939
Ha!

34:03.963 --> 34:05.941
Where's your generous
holiday spirit, probette?

34:05.965 --> 34:07.208
Bah hum-bog.

34:07.232 --> 34:09.244
Bah what?

34:09.268 --> 34:10.612
Here's another angle, Gibbs.

34:10.636 --> 34:12.313
Freeze it right there.

34:12.338 --> 34:14.716
Patrick Ellis played lacrosse?

34:14.739 --> 34:16.418
Yeah, team captain.

34:16.442 --> 34:17.619
Abby, try lacrosse.

34:17.643 --> 34:19.167
Checking.

34:21.347 --> 34:24.759
Okay, today's lacrosse sticks
are a composite of

34:24.783 --> 34:26.161
aluminum and titanium,

34:26.185 --> 34:28.463
and the head is made
out of nylon and leather mesh.

34:28.487 --> 34:31.513
The exact same breakdown
we found in the wound.

34:33.859 --> 34:35.303
Abel and Cain.

34:35.327 --> 34:37.955
He killed his own brother.

34:42.101 --> 34:43.344
Hey.

34:43.369 --> 34:45.746
What's going on?

34:45.771 --> 34:48.315
So, Patrick, we know
that you were at the park

34:48.340 --> 34:50.150
the other morning with Thomas.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.453
I was at school.

34:51.476 --> 34:52.987
What are you talking about?

34:53.012 --> 34:56.623
No. You went there to confront
him about being Muslim.

34:56.648 --> 34:59.127
You argued,
you lost your temper.

34:59.151 --> 35:00.929
Most lacrosse players like
to run with their sticks.

35:00.953 --> 35:01.953
Where's yours?

35:03.956 --> 35:06.334
Dad, I just went on a... a run.

35:06.358 --> 35:09.037
Is it broken,
or did you destroy the evidence?

35:09.061 --> 35:11.406
I like the letter
to the chaplain.

35:11.430 --> 35:13.508
The cut-and-paste letters...
very Zodiac.

35:13.532 --> 35:16.745
Dad, you got to believe me.

35:16.769 --> 35:19.014
Thom was embarrassing us.

35:19.038 --> 35:20.548
People were laughing at him.

35:20.572 --> 35:22.369
I did this for you.

35:26.011 --> 35:28.502
Thomas just wanted
to find the good in people.

35:30.282 --> 35:31.860
Yes, he found God, his God,

35:31.884 --> 35:34.462
and that humiliated me,
but he was still my son.

35:34.486 --> 35:36.831
But I'm your son, too.

35:36.855 --> 35:39.768
You taught us
to be proud, you know.

35:39.792 --> 35:41.770
Proud of this family.

35:41.794 --> 35:46.041
And when Thom changed,
everything changed,

35:46.065 --> 35:49.344
because the one thing
this family always had

35:49.368 --> 35:51.346
was honor.

35:51.370 --> 35:53.270
And he ruined that!

35:55.507 --> 35:58.544
I loved him so much,
and he turned his back on us.

36:00.546 --> 36:01.823
I don't know.

36:01.847 --> 36:03.782
Maybe we turned our back on him.

36:27.873 --> 36:29.864
Not very traditional.

36:31.310 --> 36:33.335
Yeah, it is.

36:37.416 --> 36:38.815
Let's talk.

36:44.690 --> 36:46.634
You called Betty Hannigan?

36:46.658 --> 36:48.803
She told me to call the sheriff.

36:48.827 --> 36:51.296
Ed sent you the report?

36:58.737 --> 37:02.730
How about you fill in
some of the details?

37:12.151 --> 37:14.395
He rumbled up
in an old fastback.

37:14.419 --> 37:16.631
Whole town could hear him.

37:16.655 --> 37:18.666
Yeah. Dirt-kicker
looking for trouble.

37:18.690 --> 37:20.668
I guess.

37:20.692 --> 37:23.104
The Dobson girl
was in the store.

37:23.128 --> 37:24.405
She had a friend visiting.

37:24.429 --> 37:26.420
I never got her name.

37:27.766 --> 37:29.844
He said he come there to rob me.

37:29.868 --> 37:31.859
He had a gun, Leroy.

37:33.338 --> 37:36.684
I told him to take anything
he wanted from the register,

37:36.708 --> 37:40.455
but... the girls
were in the corner,

37:40.479 --> 37:43.825
crouching, terrified.

37:43.849 --> 37:45.908
He turned after them and...

37:49.955 --> 37:52.934
Well, that's not the first time
you fired that Winchester.

37:52.958 --> 37:54.269
No.

37:54.293 --> 37:57.160
It's not the first time
I killed somebody, either.

37:58.697 --> 38:01.165
But it's the first time
I saw the face.

38:03.802 --> 38:06.270
Twenty-three.

38:07.773 --> 38:11.106
Had a kid, somebody told me.

38:14.680 --> 38:17.225
Looks different
up there in the cockpit, huh?

38:17.249 --> 38:19.027
Uh, yeah, yeah.

38:19.051 --> 38:23.164
From up there, it doesn't
look like much of anything.

38:23.188 --> 38:27.181
You pull the trigger,
feel the release, nothing.

38:28.994 --> 38:31.121
I never even
thought about it much.

38:34.132 --> 38:36.930
Now, that's all I think about.

38:40.706 --> 38:44.369
How did you do it
all these years, son?

38:45.510 --> 38:47.822
I need to know.

38:47.846 --> 38:50.592
This why you came?

38:50.616 --> 38:53.642
That and because it's Christmas.

38:56.655 --> 38:59.385
It's not supposed to be easy.

39:03.462 --> 39:05.607
Nobody said it would be, huh?

39:05.631 --> 39:08.623
No.

39:28.020 --> 39:29.954
Attention on deck!

39:40.399 --> 39:41.943
- I can't. I can't.
- Of course you can.

39:41.967 --> 39:43.745
- Please, I don't...
- Go back. Go back!

39:43.769 --> 39:45.013
- I don't want to. I don't want to.
- You... come on, Tony!

39:45.037 --> 39:46.080
- You can't make me. I...
- Go back!

39:46.104 --> 39:48.383
I don't want to do it.
I can't do it.

39:48.407 --> 39:50.718
Special Agent DiNozzo?

39:56.882 --> 39:58.760
Merry Christmas, Delores.

40:03.422 --> 40:05.366
I got this for you.

40:05.390 --> 40:07.221
I looked in your personnel file.

40:08.660 --> 40:10.805
Which is legal, 'cause I have
that security clearance.

40:10.829 --> 40:14.242
But I saw that
when you were eight years old,

40:14.266 --> 40:16.244
all the little girls
in your neighborhood...

40:16.268 --> 40:19.947
they all got
this incredible doll,

40:19.971 --> 40:22.183
the-the Knee-High
Cherry Pie doll.

40:22.207 --> 40:24.052
And you didn't get one.

40:24.076 --> 40:28.513
Uh, I guess Santa didn't
make enough that year, so...

40:30.682 --> 40:32.894
I got this for you.

41:02.047 --> 41:03.324
All right, Fisher.

41:03.348 --> 41:04.992
Right this way, my friend.

41:05.016 --> 41:07.484
Whoa. What is this place?

41:08.987 --> 41:10.965
This is a very special room

41:10.989 --> 41:12.867
that only a few people
know about.

41:12.891 --> 41:15.636
It's a magic room called MTAC.

41:15.660 --> 41:16.637
Aunt?

41:16.661 --> 41:19.607
Don't look at me.

41:19.631 --> 41:22.777
See, Santa told me

41:22.801 --> 41:25.513
very specifically
to bring you here.

41:25.537 --> 41:27.682
Why? What's gonna happen?

41:27.706 --> 41:30.251
Well, let's make
a Christmas wish

41:30.275 --> 41:32.266
and see if it comes true.

41:33.512 --> 41:34.489
How about that?

41:34.513 --> 41:35.523
Yeah.

41:35.547 --> 41:38.726
Want you to shut your eyes
good and tight.

41:38.750 --> 41:40.395
Got 'em closed?

41:40.419 --> 41:41.829
All right.

41:41.853 --> 41:43.398
Now...

41:43.422 --> 41:45.700
All right, I want you to think

41:45.724 --> 41:47.835
of the one thing
you want for Christmas

41:47.859 --> 41:50.271
more than anything else
in the entire world.

41:50.295 --> 41:51.963
You ready?

41:55.100 --> 41:57.612
Oh, Fisher, baby, is that you?

41:57.636 --> 41:59.046
Mom!

41:59.070 --> 42:00.448
Oh, I love you, sweetheart.

42:00.472 --> 42:01.616
Merry Christmas.

42:01.640 --> 42:02.750
Look at you.

42:02.774 --> 42:04.752
You are getting so big.

42:04.776 --> 42:07.789
I got all the mail you sent,
all your artwork.

42:07.813 --> 42:08.990
Your pictures.

42:09.014 --> 42:10.391
I'll make you more.

42:10.415 --> 42:12.427
I can't wait.

42:12.451 --> 42:13.861
I have told everybody here

42:13.885 --> 42:16.564
all about you,
about how proud I am of you.

42:16.588 --> 42:17.765
You know, we're going to have

42:17.789 --> 42:18.966
a big Christmas dinner
here tonight.

42:18.990 --> 42:22.737
But I'd rather be there instead.

42:22.761 --> 42:24.939
I wish you were, too.

42:24.963 --> 42:26.607
Well, not bad, huh?

42:26.631 --> 42:28.409
Pulled it off.

42:28.433 --> 42:29.977
- Would you like that?
- Yeah!

42:30.001 --> 42:32.079
This was my favorite story...

42:32.103 --> 42:34.048
You would make a great Santa.

42:34.072 --> 42:35.416
"'Twas the night before..."

42:35.440 --> 42:37.351
I guess you just got to believe.

42:37.375 --> 42:38.953
"Not a creature was stirring..."

42:38.977 --> 42:40.955
I do believe.

42:40.979 --> 42:43.391
"The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

42:43.415 --> 42:45.193
in hopes that St. Nicholas..."

42:58.029 --> 43:00.241
I'll go warm up the sleigh.
