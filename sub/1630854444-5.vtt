WEBVTT

03:26.541 --> 03:28.333
We're still in control.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.416
Even if they take the bridge.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.041
We could block the steering.

03:38.416 --> 03:40.250
As long as we hold the machine room,

03:41.208 --> 03:42.583
we're in charge.

03:43.541 --> 03:46.833
And I say we hold our course to America.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.000
How far from land are we?

03:54.458 --> 03:56.666
Four days, maybe three.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.875
What will they do with us when we arrive?

04:00.791 --> 04:02.416
Mutiny carries the death penalty.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.916
Justice is always
on the side of the survivors.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.625
The Light will always prevail.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.625
We're not going to surrender.

04:30.916 --> 04:32.625
Even if it means more sacrifices.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.833
Remember the time
when Ada bathed the piglet in the font?

05:12.333 --> 05:14.375
She was always different
from the rest of us.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.958
And she was never afraid of Mother.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.416
You know it's not true, right?

05:24.458 --> 05:25.958
You know she's sick.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.208
Mother.

05:27.958 --> 05:30.208
The voices she hears,
that's not the voice of God.

05:31.083 --> 05:32.875
She created her own world.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.583
Her own truths. We all just followed her.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.958
But hearing voices is not a sign of God.

05:40.375 --> 05:41.958
It's a sign of madness.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.125
What if she's right?

05:46.958 --> 05:49.416
Do you honestly think
all this is the will of God?

05:51.166 --> 05:52.791
After all that has happened.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.291
You helped her kill that boy.

06:05.916 --> 06:08.333
It's not like you haven't killed before.

06:18.958 --> 06:19.958
That was different.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.750
You promised me
we would leave them, together.

06:26.958 --> 06:30.625
You promised me we would leave them
as soon as we came to America. With Ada.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.416
What are you doing?

06:47.083 --> 06:49.541
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.125
Tove.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.750
Were you ever in love with me?
Even for one day?

07:29.625 --> 07:31.458
It's so easy for you.

07:32.791 --> 07:34.625
You have all you could ever need.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.791
You don't realize how hard others have
to struggle to get to where you are.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.791
So it was all a lie.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.541
You're not a lieutenant.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.958
Your father never owned any land.

07:53.916 --> 07:56.583
That uncle of yours
in Marseille doesn't even exist.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.958
You want to know
if I was ever really in love with you?

08:09.166 --> 08:11.833
Every morning, I wake up wishing I wasn't.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.833
You are a constant reminder
of what I can't have.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.291
A life.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.458
Love.

08:23.541 --> 08:24.583
You.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.375
Captain?

08:32.666 --> 08:34.291
What do we do now?

08:44.166 --> 08:48.416
Hey! Don't shoot.
Please don't shoot. I'm here to help.

08:49.083 --> 08:49.916
Okay?

08:51.666 --> 08:53.416
I'll help stop my mother.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.166
What was that? What's in there?

08:58.250 --> 08:59.458
Huh?

11:11.125 --> 11:12.375
What?

11:13.708 --> 11:14.750
Fuck.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.041
What's that noise?

11:45.083 --> 11:46.375
What's happening?

11:49.250 --> 11:51.000
Hey, please!

11:54.791 --> 11:56.083
What is this?

11:59.625 --> 12:00.916
My God, what now?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.875
This is it. We're all going to die.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.000
Hey! Stop it.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.291
Stop!

12:27.875 --> 12:29.500
You are the captain.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.500
What do you want to do?

13:06.916 --> 13:08.791
It stopped. And now?

13:12.583 --> 13:13.875
What is going on?

13:14.375 --> 13:15.916
It sounds like a clock.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.166
What is happening?

13:34.250 --> 13:35.750
What are you doing?

14:13.250 --> 14:14.333
Mom?

14:21.916 --> 14:22.916
Mom?

14:53.250 --> 14:54.416
What's going on?

14:55.458 --> 14:58.583
You are crew. You have to know
what that sound means.

15:01.583 --> 15:02.541
What?

15:05.875 --> 15:09.583
What are you looking at me for?
I don't know what it is.

15:15.791 --> 15:16.875
Krester?

15:21.250 --> 15:22.250
Krester!

15:51.333 --> 15:53.208
Where are they going?

15:53.708 --> 15:55.625
God help us.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.833
The Devil is calling them.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.750
Eugen!

16:02.500 --> 16:05.250
Stop. Halt. Stop!

16:12.333 --> 16:13.333
Eugen!

16:27.000 --> 16:28.041
Mom!

16:31.916 --> 16:33.541
What are you doing?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.083
Mom!

17:00.125 --> 17:01.125
No.

17:02.541 --> 17:03.541
Stop!

17:06.458 --> 17:07.500
Stop!

17:07.583 --> 17:09.416
No!

17:35.458 --> 17:37.208
I think that was a body!

17:42.750 --> 17:44.083
What's going on?

19:25.750 --> 19:28.416
-Lower your guns!
-First lower yours!

19:32.333 --> 19:34.333
They're jumping overboard.

19:35.458 --> 19:36.916
What are you talking about?

19:38.416 --> 19:39.458
Where is Krester?

19:41.416 --> 19:43.875
Dad. Where is Krester?

19:46.625 --> 19:47.833
He jumped.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.166
No.

19:53.250 --> 19:54.625
I couldn't save him.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.916
They're all jumping overboard!

20:03.291 --> 20:04.250
All of them!

20:04.333 --> 20:06.208
They're all killing themselves!

20:06.791 --> 20:07.916
Don't let them through!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.458
-Where are you going?
-Stop them!

20:09.541 --> 20:10.416
Stop!

20:10.500 --> 20:11.375
Please!

20:12.416 --> 20:14.416
Stop right there!

20:14.500 --> 20:18.208
Hello! Hello! Can you hear me?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.958
We'll have to tie them up.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.333
Everyone stop!

20:23.416 --> 20:24.541
Stop right there!

20:25.375 --> 20:26.750
Where are you going?

20:29.041 --> 20:30.333
Stop!

20:34.583 --> 20:35.583
Are you okay?

20:36.166 --> 20:37.541
She jumped…

20:44.833 --> 20:47.333
Stop! Stop!

25:38.375 --> 25:40.833
Ángel! Ángel, it's me, open the door!

25:41.416 --> 25:44.541
The tarara has

25:45.416 --> 25:49.916
-A wounded little finger that…
-Ángel.

25:50.541 --> 25:54.541
-No surgeon can cure
-Ángel.

26:01.708 --> 26:02.875
Stop!

26:09.041 --> 26:10.500
What are you waiting for?

26:11.041 --> 26:12.708
You'd actually be doing me a favor.

26:13.208 --> 26:14.833
Sit down.

26:18.375 --> 26:19.541
Tie him up!

26:26.208 --> 26:27.166
Your turn.

26:32.208 --> 26:35.375
What the fuck are you doing?
Kill me! Just get it over with!

26:36.958 --> 26:39.083
Why are you doing this?

26:39.708 --> 26:42.666
I didn't come here to kill you.
I'm trying to save your life.

26:51.458 --> 26:53.958
Whatever's happening out there,
I am sure it's contagious.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.500
Quickly, tie them up.

27:02.166 --> 27:03.333
He jumped.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.458
He just jumped.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.750
Mother, listen to me.

27:06.833 --> 27:09.916
-Mother, it will be all right. Mother!
-And ourselves.

27:11.458 --> 27:13.208
-Mother!
-Hey!

27:13.291 --> 27:14.375
Tove!

27:16.625 --> 27:18.416
Why doesn't he stop it?

27:22.916 --> 27:25.333
I shouldn't have let my mom come with me.

27:26.791 --> 27:28.500
It is all my fault.

27:29.791 --> 27:30.875
You will live.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.166
I promise.

27:35.083 --> 27:37.125
Come on. Come on.

37:21.291 --> 37:22.875
This is impossible.

37:23.458 --> 37:26.458
Thoughts are free

37:26.541 --> 37:29.500
Who can guess what they might be?

37:31.208 --> 37:32.541
They fly by

37:32.625 --> 37:35.458
Like shadows in the night

37:35.541 --> 37:38.500
No one can know them

37:38.583 --> 37:41.750
No hunter can shoot them

37:41.833 --> 37:47.791
And so it'll always be
Thoughts are free

38:54.250 --> 38:55.666
Thank God, you're back.

38:59.458 --> 39:01.083
They're all killing themselves.

39:01.708 --> 39:04.166
I tried to contact the ship company.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.291
And this is what they replied.

39:12.375 --> 39:15.875
The captain was right.
We must change course, return to Europe.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.416
What is that?

39:23.750 --> 39:25.666
Nothing you need
concern yourself with now.

42:01.750 --> 42:04.708
The sound. It stopped.

42:15.750 --> 42:16.875
You came back.

42:18.125 --> 42:19.375
Of course I came back.

42:29.625 --> 42:30.625
Mother.

42:31.958 --> 42:33.750
Krester. Krester.

42:38.666 --> 42:39.666
Krester.

42:47.416 --> 42:48.791
It'll be all right, Mother.

42:49.916 --> 42:51.041
It will be all right.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.125
What's going on?

43:08.583 --> 43:11.083
-I think we're safe now.
-Safe from what?

43:12.333 --> 43:13.333
Jérôme.

43:14.375 --> 43:15.458
What's going on?

44:11.708 --> 44:13.083
Is that everyone?

44:14.041 --> 44:15.416
Are we the only ones left?

44:23.458 --> 44:26.500
Captain, I think you should see this.

44:35.333 --> 44:36.708
They keep sending the same thing.
