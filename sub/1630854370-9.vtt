WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:14.000 --> 00:15.413
<i>After closing-</i>

00:15.413 --> 00:19.413
at 4 AM on April 13th,
an inferno raged-

00:19.413 --> 00:21.310
through Tropiks Nightclub.

00:21.310 --> 00:23.172
<i>Before then-</i>

00:23.172 --> 00:24.655
<i>the building was
in good shape.</i>

00:24.655 --> 00:26.034
No faulty wiring.

00:26.793 --> 00:27.448
Gas lines-

00:27.551 --> 00:29.310
<i>intact.</i>

00:29.310 --> 00:30.241
<i>No reason-</i>

00:30.241 --> 00:33.172
<i>it should erupt suddenly
and furiously-</i>

00:33.172 --> 00:35.068
unless by design.

00:35.068 --> 00:37.551
<i>The nightclub's owner,
Mr. Gene Powell here-</i>

00:37.551 --> 00:39.034
<i>stands accused
of two charges.</i>

00:39.034 --> 00:41.862
Arson for Fraudulent Purpose.

00:41.862 --> 00:43.206
Arson-

00:44.310 --> 00:46.965
with Disregard
for Human Life.

00:48.206 --> 00:50.310
I called 911 after
I saw the smoke.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.206
But before the
firefighters could arrive-

00:52.206 --> 00:53.482
Mr. Powell came out-

00:54.310 --> 00:56.482
just stood there
and watched it burn.

00:56.482 --> 00:57.689
The defendant will suggest-

00:57.689 --> 01:01.931
he is simply the victim
of a random attack.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.758
Yet-

01:03.758 --> 01:05.620
with so much
to lose-

01:05.620 --> 01:07.931
he had so
much to gain.

01:09.172 --> 01:11.103
My Financial Crimes Unit-

01:11.103 --> 01:14.172
noted frequent inconsistencies
in Mr. Powell's books-

01:14.172 --> 01:17.413
to the tune of $1.2
million in back taxes.

01:17.413 --> 01:19.689
The insurance payout
for the nightclub fire-

01:19.689 --> 01:21.551
is about double
that amount.

01:21.551 --> 01:24.482
Backed into a
corner, Mr. Powell-

01:24.482 --> 01:27.137
<i>set that
fire deliberately.</i>

01:27.137 --> 01:28.965
There is only
one victim here-

01:30.103 --> 01:33.034
the man who perished
in that inferno.

01:34.206 --> 01:37.206
And that man deserves
justice here today.

01:37.206 --> 01:38.344
<i>Dr. Truong.</i>

01:38.344 --> 01:40.758
Could you please tell the
jury what your team found-

01:40.758 --> 01:42.034
when the fire was
finally extinguished?

01:42.034 --> 01:43.827
Components of accelerant bombs-

01:43.827 --> 01:45.689
were scattered
around the nightclub.

01:45.689 --> 01:49.275
<i>A concoction of volatile
chemicals and aluminum shavings.</i>

01:50.448 --> 01:53.551
Along with some heavily
burnt human remains.

01:53.551 --> 01:56.275
Now, were you able
to identify the victim?

01:56.275 --> 01:57.896
I'm sure there's
a family out there-

01:57.896 --> 02:00.586
that would like
Mr. Powell answer-

02:00.586 --> 02:02.000
for his crime.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.517
Unfortunately I can't
provide that for them.

02:04.517 --> 02:06.103
The few uncorrupted-

02:06.103 --> 02:08.379
DNA indicators
we were able pull-

02:08.379 --> 02:10.827
<i>were insufficient to
match to any one person-</i>

02:10.827 --> 02:12.068
<i>in our DNA database.</i>

02:12.068 --> 02:13.344
And why is that,
Dr. Truong?

02:13.344 --> 02:14.000
<i>The accelerant bomb-</i>

02:14.000 --> 02:16.068
used in this blaze-

02:16.068 --> 02:18.517
was designed to burn
for as long as possible.

02:18.517 --> 02:20.586
So the body was
essentially cremated.

02:20.586 --> 02:22.965
Thank you, Dr. Truong.

02:27.482 --> 02:29.034
Your record precedes you.

02:29.034 --> 02:31.517
<i>Years of experience
as Chief of Forensics.</i>

02:31.517 --> 02:33.172
A role with the
Major Crimes Unit.

02:33.172 --> 02:34.827
Yes that's all correct.

02:34.827 --> 02:37.620
And a good working relationship
with the Crown Attorney.

02:37.620 --> 02:38.965
In fact-

02:38.965 --> 02:39.862
weren't you
at one time-

02:39.862 --> 02:41.000
involved intimately-

02:41.000 --> 02:41.655
with Mr. Billinger?

02:41.655 --> 02:43.000
Objection- relevance!

02:43.000 --> 02:44.655
Sustained.

02:45.517 --> 02:46.517
Has Mr. Billinger-

02:46.517 --> 02:48.793
ever asked you to alter
your findings, Doctor?

02:48.793 --> 02:49.862
<i>You're treading
into dangerous waters-</i>

02:49.862 --> 02:50.862
Ms. Creehan.

02:50.862 --> 02:52.172
Where are you
going with this?

02:52.172 --> 02:55.241
Just trying to establish why an
experienced forensic analyst-

02:55.241 --> 02:56.137
failed to
identify the body.

02:56.137 --> 02:57.689
Objection Your Honour!

02:58.689 --> 03:00.379
I withdraw.

03:00.379 --> 03:02.068
No further questions,
Your Honour.

03:02.068 --> 03:05.068
<i>The defense calls Dr. Reva
Warner to the stand.</i>

03:11.724 --> 03:13.310
Dr. Warner.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.620
You've been a
senior associate-

03:14.620 --> 03:17.344
at Sutherland Schmidt
Forensics for how long?

03:17.344 --> 03:19.172
Eight years and counting.

03:19.172 --> 03:20.827
<i>I appreciate
your expert insight-</i>

03:20.827 --> 03:22.344
<i>as an independent source.</i>

03:22.344 --> 03:23.931
<i>You had access
to the evidence.</i>

03:23.931 --> 03:25.517
Did you come to any
different conclusions?

03:25.517 --> 03:26.620
I can't understand-

03:26.620 --> 03:30.413
why Dr. Truong wasn't
able to identify the body.

03:31.827 --> 03:34.689
He practically walked up and
introduced himself to me.

03:36.448 --> 03:38.724
Would you mind introducing
this court to him too?

03:38.724 --> 03:39.689
Meet-

03:40.310 --> 03:41.862
David Gallo.

03:43.586 --> 03:46.275
<i>Public records state he was
recently released from prison-</i>

03:46.275 --> 03:47.379
<i>on an arson charge.</i>

03:47.379 --> 03:48.793
So at this fire-

03:48.793 --> 03:50.586
which the defendant
supposedly set-

03:51.896 --> 03:53.896
there was a master
arsonist on the scene?

03:53.896 --> 03:56.241
Well <i>master</i> is
a strong word.

03:56.241 --> 03:58.413
He did burn himself
up after all.

04:01.310 --> 04:02.034
Order.

04:21.965 --> 04:23.862
<i>Judge Costa agreed
to adjourn for the weekend.</i>

04:23.862 --> 04:25.586
But I'm still going to
need a miracle by Monday.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.206
Well what do you want
us to do about that?

04:29.206 --> 04:30.344
It's not a Major
Crimes case.

04:30.344 --> 04:31.448
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:31.448 --> 04:33.275
I thought you had Financial
Crimes handling this?

04:33.275 --> 04:34.206
<i>Yeah</i>

04:34.206 --> 04:35.310
<i>I thought they had
enough to convict.</i>

04:35.310 --> 04:37.344
But I was relying on
Sarah's testimony to seal it-

04:37.344 --> 04:40.310
before Reva's little surprise.

04:40.310 --> 04:41.448
<i>Hold on.</i>

04:41.448 --> 04:43.000
I was thorough and
by the book on this.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.827
Thorough wasn't
enough to get results.

04:44.827 --> 04:47.310
It would've been helpful
to know that we had-

04:47.310 --> 04:48.827
<i>an arsonist on our
hands ahead of time.</i>

04:48.827 --> 04:49.862
It should've been impossible-

04:49.862 --> 04:51.965
to pull uncompromised
DNA from those remains.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.448
And we tried to
identify the victim-

04:53.448 --> 04:54.931
with the Missing
Persons Database.

04:54.931 --> 04:57.482
There was nothing to tie
this to Gallo until now.

04:57.482 --> 04:58.344
<i>So even if Gallo-</i>

04:58.344 --> 04:59.862
did set the fires-

04:59.862 --> 05:02.034
how do we know that he
wasn't hired by Powell?

05:02.034 --> 05:03.862
Proving that is my only
shot at a conviction.

05:03.862 --> 05:06.034
I need Major
Crimes' fresh eyes-

05:06.034 --> 05:07.206
and Rex's nose
on this now.

05:08.689 --> 05:10.689
What if we can't
prove it by Monday?

05:11.413 --> 05:12.724
Then a guilty
man goes free.

05:20.241 --> 05:21.034
<i>Sarah.</i>

05:21.034 --> 05:22.344
You okay?

05:23.034 --> 05:23.655
Yeah.

05:23.655 --> 05:24.551
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:27.172 --> 05:28.344
Ah, you can
lie to me.

05:28.344 --> 05:29.206
You can't
lie to Rex.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.275
<i>And I mean, what
do we even know-</i>

05:31.275 --> 05:32.931
about this so-called
expert witness?

05:32.931 --> 05:33.758
Defense could
have gotten

05:33.758 --> 05:34.965
one of those
liar-for hire types.

05:34.965 --> 05:37.206
That's the part
that worries me.

05:37.206 --> 05:40.413
In my past experience,
Reva's always been credible.

05:40.413 --> 05:41.482
Warner? Reva Warner?

05:41.482 --> 05:42.655
You know her?

05:42.655 --> 05:44.137
Yeah we were in the same
graduating year at university.

05:44.137 --> 05:46.172
She and I were always neck-
in-neck for top of the class.

05:46.172 --> 05:48.241
Why does that name
sound so familiar to me?

05:48.241 --> 05:49.655
She's the best-selling
true crime author.

05:49.655 --> 05:50.758
She does those-

05:50.758 --> 05:52.724
Forensic Scientist Debunks
Hollywood Movies videos-

05:52.724 --> 05:53.379
<i>on Youtube.</i>

05:54.620 --> 05:55.965
It's pretty tacky.

05:55.965 --> 05:58.931
I mean a good
scientist maybe.

05:58.931 --> 06:01.724
But she's just always
been a real spotlight hog.

06:04.206 --> 06:04.896
Okay.

06:05.137 --> 06:05.965
Cancel your weekend plans.

06:05.965 --> 06:07.379
<i>We're taking the case.</i>

06:08.758 --> 06:09.965
With a possible ID
on the body-

06:09.965 --> 06:11.896
we have an obligation
to investigate this.

06:12.965 --> 06:13.758
Sarah.

06:14.068 --> 06:15.517
I'm sure you did
your due diligence.

06:15.517 --> 06:16.413
But still.

06:16.413 --> 06:17.586
No, it's okay.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.965
I just have to figure
out how I missed this.

06:30.103 --> 06:31.655
Superintendent Lewis.

06:31.655 --> 06:32.655
Thanks for meeting me.

06:32.655 --> 06:34.448
The pleasure's
all mine.

06:35.344 --> 06:36.620
You know, this
David Gallo thing-

06:36.620 --> 06:38.689
is really throwing a
spanner in the works.

06:38.689 --> 06:39.379
Yeah.

06:39.379 --> 06:40.241
Yeah, sure is.

06:40.241 --> 06:41.448
<i>I'm sure we can
still get Powell-</i>

06:41.448 --> 06:44.206
if we put our
heads together.

06:44.206 --> 06:45.310
I'm glad you agree.

06:45.965 --> 06:47.206
Which is why I
need your team-

06:47.206 --> 06:49.931
to send the case files to Major
Crimes as soon as possible.

06:51.379 --> 06:54.413
It'd be a lot easier if your
team came to Financial Crimes.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.206
<i>My team's already briefed.</i>

06:56.206 --> 06:57.965
Well your team
did all they could.

06:57.965 --> 06:59.517
And a great
job at that.

06:59.517 --> 07:00.793
But you know-

07:00.793 --> 07:02.482
the Crown Prosecutor's
just asked Major Crimes-

07:02.482 --> 07:04.000
to take this across
the finish line.

07:06.172 --> 07:08.517
I see what you're
doing here.

07:08.517 --> 07:09.965
And it's not
going to work.

07:11.620 --> 07:12.724
This is time sensitive.

07:13.896 --> 07:15.241
This is so Major Crimes
is better equipped-

07:15.241 --> 07:16.655
to deal with an
arson investigation.

07:16.655 --> 07:17.482
This-

07:17.482 --> 07:18.862
<i>It's not personal.</i>

07:19.448 --> 07:20.620
Of course.

07:20.620 --> 07:21.965
Purely professional.

07:23.241 --> 07:24.931
I'll have my boys
bring over the files.

07:25.689 --> 07:26.448
Best of luck.

07:32.310 --> 07:33.344
David Gallo.

07:33.344 --> 07:35.482
He spent five years
in Her Majesty's Pen-

07:35.482 --> 07:37.172
for burning down a
heritage building downtown.

07:37.172 --> 07:39.034
Yeah, I remember
that case.

07:39.034 --> 07:40.551
A developer wanted
the land cleared-

07:40.551 --> 07:41.827
and couldn't tear
it down legally.

07:41.827 --> 07:43.310
<i>I've got the Marshall's
report from that fire.</i>

07:43.310 --> 07:45.344
It's the same MO.

07:45.344 --> 07:47.275
Another aluminum
shaving accelerant bomb.

07:47.275 --> 07:49.482
How did we not catch
that connection before?

07:49.482 --> 07:52.310
Well David's name never turned
up in the initial investigation-

07:52.310 --> 07:53.931
<i>because all signs
pointed to Gene.</i>

07:53.931 --> 07:55.000
And a warrant
for his arrest-

07:55.000 --> 07:56.103
only came out
earlier this month-

07:56.103 --> 07:57.862
when he failed to check
in to his parole office.

07:57.862 --> 07:59.620
<i>Ma'am.</i>

07:59.620 --> 08:01.000
Excuse me,
what are those?

08:01.758 --> 08:03.172
Those aren't digitized.

08:06.689 --> 08:08.689
Do you have any idea how
long these are going to take-

08:08.689 --> 08:09.379
to sift through?

08:10.413 --> 08:12.000
I take it Superintendent
Lewis wasn't happy-

08:12.000 --> 08:13.103
we were taking
over her case?

08:13.103 --> 08:14.793
I think this is
her idea of a joke.

08:14.793 --> 08:16.448
What are we looking
for in here anyway?

08:17.482 --> 08:20.103
Anything that proves that Gene
paid David to set that fire.

08:20.103 --> 08:21.517
Strange cash flow.

08:21.517 --> 08:22.482
Employment records.

08:22.827 --> 08:24.000
Anything, Jesse.

08:24.586 --> 08:25.551
Anything?

08:27.137 --> 08:29.724
Yeah, I do not envy
your day today.

08:29.724 --> 08:31.344
You're not helping?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.413
Uh, wish we could.

08:32.413 --> 08:35.827
But Rex and I have a
date with a parole officer.

08:37.137 --> 08:38.413
<i>Rex, come on pal.</i>

08:40.068 --> 08:41.620
Can you bring me
something caffeinated-

08:41.620 --> 08:42.586
on your way
back please?

09:00.068 --> 09:01.793
Hello cutie.

09:01.793 --> 09:03.586
<i>You don't look like
you're checking in.</i>

09:03.586 --> 09:05.448
<i>Officer Lyddon?</i>

09:05.448 --> 09:06.241
Detective Hudson.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.103
This is my
partner Rex.

09:07.103 --> 09:09.586
We're here about
David Gallo.

09:09.586 --> 09:11.068
Oh, you mean the
son of a bitch-

09:11.068 --> 09:12.482
who got me on
the Wall of Shame?

09:12.482 --> 09:13.413
Wall of Shame?

09:15.551 --> 09:16.827
<i>He was the
first parolee-</i>

09:16.827 --> 09:18.586
to slip through
my fingers.

09:20.344 --> 09:22.068
Guess he turned
up somewhere?

09:22.896 --> 09:23.965
Unfortunately, yes.

09:23.965 --> 09:25.965
His body was
identified in a fire.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.344
<i>Do you know
if he had-</i>

09:27.344 --> 09:29.551
any associations
with Gene Powell?

09:30.689 --> 09:32.620
Or maybe with the
nightclub Tropiks?

09:33.137 --> 09:34.000
Not that
I know of.

09:35.172 --> 09:37.241
Drinking was against
the terms of his parole.

09:37.241 --> 09:38.758
<i>Well it is possible-</i>

09:38.758 --> 09:40.793
that he slipped
back into arson.

09:40.793 --> 09:45.793
<i>Was there any indication of
that in your last check-in?</i>

09:45.793 --> 09:47.482
He'd be spitting
in my face if he did.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.103
I helped him get a
job at an auto shop.

09:50.896 --> 09:52.310
Even moved him out
of the halfway house-

09:52.310 --> 09:53.275
into his own place.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.655
I'm going to
need his address.

10:02.724 --> 10:04.241
God, what
has it been?

10:04.241 --> 10:04.931
Ten years?

10:04.931 --> 10:06.103
Just about!

10:07.103 --> 10:09.310
You've done very well
for yourself since then.

10:09.689 --> 10:10.827
All luck.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.793
If I hadn't landed
that internship-

10:12.793 --> 10:15.172
at Sutherland Schmidt
right after graduation-

10:16.965 --> 10:18.586
You were up for
the same job.

10:18.586 --> 10:19.758
Weren't you?

10:20.517 --> 10:22.068
I mean it's
so long ago now.

10:22.068 --> 10:23.862
I'm not sure.

10:24.965 --> 10:26.034
Well who knows?

10:26.034 --> 10:27.586
If things had
gone differently-

10:27.586 --> 10:29.482
maybe you'd be the
one meeting me-

10:29.482 --> 10:31.379
at some outpost
city like this.

10:32.413 --> 10:35.241
Well, St. John's
is not Toronto.

10:35.241 --> 10:37.482
But it's certainly
no outpost.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.068
But your facilities
can't be great here.

10:40.068 --> 10:41.517
How do you mean?

10:41.517 --> 10:43.068
Well with better equipment-

10:43.068 --> 10:46.137
maybe you would've pulled some
workable DNA off that body.

10:47.206 --> 10:50.724
You know, that's actually
what I wanted to talk about.

10:50.724 --> 10:51.413
Um-

10:52.931 --> 10:55.896
I don't understand how
you were able to pull an ID.

10:55.896 --> 10:58.551
<i>Those bones
were fully calcined.</i>

10:58.551 --> 11:02.206
Well, when you have
tissue that damaged-

11:02.206 --> 11:02.862
the only solution-

11:02.862 --> 11:05.172
<i>is mitochondrial testing.</i>

11:05.172 --> 11:07.137
We were in the same
Forensics 402 class.

11:07.137 --> 11:08.413
Thank you.

11:08.413 --> 11:13.000
It's just that results from my
test were totally inconclusive.

11:14.551 --> 11:17.137
It must be hard to do
your best work here.

11:17.137 --> 11:19.310
Cops and lawyers always
breathing down your neck-

11:19.310 --> 11:20.655
for a conviction.

11:22.827 --> 11:24.724
Convictions don't
drive my forensics.

11:25.448 --> 11:27.724
The evidence I collect
drives the theory.

11:27.724 --> 11:29.896
Not the other
way around.

11:31.241 --> 11:34.586
Actually, I heard a dog runs
the investigations in this town.

11:34.586 --> 11:36.103
<i>I mean is
that true?</i>

11:37.275 --> 11:37.965
<i>No.</i>

11:39.103 --> 11:41.000
No, Rex is a part
of the team, yes.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.103
But he's a
highly trained-

11:42.103 --> 11:42.827
Sarah.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.344
Listen to yourself.

11:44.344 --> 11:45.379
Picking up
after a dog.

11:45.379 --> 11:46.862
It is beneath you.

11:47.655 --> 11:48.689
<i>God- what
do you use?</i>

11:48.689 --> 11:51.206
<i>Doggie bags to
collect your evidence?</i>

11:51.206 --> 11:53.137
Just tell me how you
got those results, Reva.

11:54.827 --> 11:57.000
It's not complicated.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.172
I tested what
they gave me.

11:59.172 --> 12:01.241
The science
speaks for itself-

12:01.241 --> 12:02.310
if you're thorough.

12:19.137 --> 12:19.758
<i>Good morning.</i>

12:19.758 --> 12:20.689
Good morning, Charlie.

12:21.310 --> 12:22.000
Sarah.

12:22.862 --> 12:23.827
I thought you
could use a coffee.

12:24.517 --> 12:25.448
What is all- ?

12:26.344 --> 12:27.344
Or you canhave it.

12:27.862 --> 12:28.793
What is all this?

12:28.793 --> 12:30.827
I've pulled exhibits
from the courthouse.

12:30.827 --> 12:32.551
We're testing
the remains again.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.655
Does this mean that
you believe Reva now?

12:35.655 --> 12:37.172
It means it's possible.

12:37.172 --> 12:39.000
So we're going to try
to replicate her results.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.241
Retesting a hypothesis-

12:40.241 --> 12:42.689
is a crucial part of the
scientific method, after all.

12:42.689 --> 12:43.724
Did Reva get
into your head-

12:43.724 --> 12:44.413
last night?

12:44.413 --> 12:45.896
Absolutely not.

12:55.965 --> 12:56.758
What is it pal?

12:59.448 --> 13:00.689
What?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
<i>It should just
be metal fragments-</i>

13:07.000 --> 13:08.172
<i>collected from the fire.</i>

13:16.896 --> 13:18.896
<i>Looks like some
kind of circuit board?</i>

13:18.896 --> 13:19.931
I'll take it
down to Jesse.

13:19.931 --> 13:20.965
See what he
comes up with.

13:20.965 --> 13:21.655
Okay.

13:23.379 --> 13:24.482
<i>Nice work Rex.</i>

13:33.034 --> 13:34.448
Are you okay?

13:34.448 --> 13:36.034
Yeah, I'm just um-

13:36.862 --> 13:39.413
having a tough week,
or something.

13:39.413 --> 13:40.724
Science isn't fickle.

13:41.137 --> 13:42.793
If there's something that
we missed in all of this-

13:42.793 --> 13:44.000
we'll find it now.

13:47.034 --> 13:47.965
I hope so.

13:56.862 --> 13:57.551
Jesse.

13:59.379 --> 14:00.206
Yeah.

14:00.689 --> 14:01.344
<i>Whoa.</i>

14:01.344 --> 14:02.172
<i>You doing all right?</i>

14:02.172 --> 14:03.172
I have been-

14:03.172 --> 14:05.793
<i>drowning in spreadsheets
for several hours.</i>

14:05.793 --> 14:07.827
<i>Any idea
what those are?</i>

14:09.344 --> 14:10.620
<i>Huh.</i>

14:10.620 --> 14:11.620
These are in
bad shape.

14:11.620 --> 14:12.310
<i>But-</i>

14:13.344 --> 14:15.517
they look like super-
conductor chips.

14:15.517 --> 14:17.241
You want to explain
that to the rest of us-

14:17.241 --> 14:18.275
who don't crack open
our cellphones-

14:18.275 --> 14:18.931
<i>for fun?</i>

14:18.931 --> 14:19.793
I did that
one time.

14:19.793 --> 14:20.689
And it was
very educational.

14:21.379 --> 14:22.275
These are in everything.

14:22.275 --> 14:24.172
Cellphones, minivans.

14:24.172 --> 14:25.034
Gaming consoles.

14:25.034 --> 14:26.655
Anything with computing powers.

14:26.655 --> 14:27.655
Are they valuable?

14:28.137 --> 14:29.620
Oh, they're worth
their weight in gold.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.275
I mean there's a global
shortage right now.

14:32.448 --> 14:34.344
What is a nightclub
owner doing with them?

14:34.344 --> 14:36.379
Do you have any transactions
that would explain-

14:36.379 --> 14:38.034
how Gene could've gotten
his hands on those?

14:38.034 --> 14:39.241
<i>No,
here's the thing.</i>

14:39.241 --> 14:41.241
I went through Financial
Crimes files on Gene.

14:41.241 --> 14:43.068
And I just can't make
sense of any of it.

14:43.068 --> 14:44.931
I have trouble with
Excel spreadsheets too.

14:44.931 --> 14:46.000
<i>Not that.</i>

14:46.000 --> 14:47.068
<i>For one-</i>

14:47.068 --> 14:48.931
this guy has more money
coming in than going out.

14:48.931 --> 14:49.758
Okay?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.379
There's no sign
of any withdrawal-

14:51.379 --> 14:52.448
to pay David
the arsonist-

14:52.448 --> 14:54.620
or to even buy
tech like this.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.172
So maybe he's got
a second source of income?

14:56.172 --> 14:57.379
<i>That's what I
was thinking too.</i>

14:57.379 --> 14:58.896
<i>But this is where
things get weird.</i>

14:59.482 --> 15:00.620
<i>It's like Financial Crimes-</i>

15:00.620 --> 15:02.689
<i>is running six different
investigations on this guy.</i>

15:02.689 --> 15:04.000
There are files
on cases in here-

15:04.000 --> 15:06.482
that already laid
convictions on other people.

15:06.482 --> 15:07.793
Who's this guy?

15:07.896 --> 15:09.206
<i>A known
gun smuggler.</i>

15:09.206 --> 15:12.310
There are files on a bunch of
other dealers that were nabbed.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.482
So the Tropiks is
a criminal hotspot?

15:14.482 --> 15:15.827
Well they didn't
include a guide-

15:15.827 --> 15:17.206
on how to connect
any of these files.

15:17.206 --> 15:19.275
I don't know how Gene
is mixed up in all this.

15:19.275 --> 15:20.482
<i>You know what?</i>

15:20.482 --> 15:22.862
Let me have another conversation
with Superintendent Lewis.

15:22.862 --> 15:24.896
And we'll get the answer
directly from the source.

15:29.586 --> 15:30.482
Hey!

15:30.482 --> 15:31.275
There you are.

15:31.275 --> 15:32.620
I was just coming
to see you.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.034
Solved it already?

15:34.034 --> 15:35.103
Must be a record.

15:35.103 --> 15:36.275
Pretty impressive.

15:36.275 --> 15:37.344
Yeah that's very funny.

15:38.275 --> 15:39.965
You know, almost as
funny as sending us-

15:39.965 --> 15:42.620
an entire recycling
plant's worth of paper.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.275
We can't make
heads or tails of it.

15:44.275 --> 15:45.551
Well you should
have known better.

15:45.551 --> 15:48.344
Trying to cram a year's worth of
investigation into a weekend?

15:48.344 --> 15:49.034
Ha.

15:49.034 --> 15:49.689
Come on now.

15:49.689 --> 15:50.379
Wait.

15:50.379 --> 15:51.379
Hold on, a
year's worth?

15:52.551 --> 15:54.241
This is about way
more than just a fire.

15:54.241 --> 15:55.965
What else are you
trying to nab Gene for?

15:55.965 --> 15:57.413
It's your investigation now.

15:57.413 --> 15:58.896
<i>Figure it out.</i>

15:58.896 --> 16:00.862
Vanessa, I don't
know what I've done-

16:00.862 --> 16:02.827
to warrant this
kind of hostility.

16:02.827 --> 16:04.103
Just can't we work
together here?

16:04.103 --> 16:04.862
<i>You've had
your chance.</i>

16:05.758 --> 16:07.827
But Major Crimes
needs their win, right?

16:07.827 --> 16:09.379
My team just what-?

16:09.379 --> 16:10.551
gets sidelined?

16:10.551 --> 16:12.965
All your team's work is
going to go for naught-

16:12.965 --> 16:14.758
if we can't
crack this.

16:14.758 --> 16:16.137
We just need
to know-

16:16.137 --> 16:18.068
how David Gallo
factors in.

16:18.068 --> 16:19.689
<i>Talk to somebody
who knows.</i>

16:19.689 --> 16:21.655
I've given
you all I got.

16:27.793 --> 16:28.689
This is David's place.

16:28.689 --> 16:29.965
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

16:29.965 --> 16:31.551
<i>This building has
a no pets policy.</i>

16:33.620 --> 16:34.965
Good think
he's not a pet.

16:36.275 --> 16:36.931
<i>What the- ?</i>

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
<i>Your tenant has been
dead for two months.</i>

16:40.000 --> 16:41.379
<i>You didn't notice
he wasn't here?</i>

16:41.379 --> 16:42.896
<i>Dead, alive.</i>

16:43.965 --> 16:45.310
<i>I don't care so long
so the rent comes in.</i>

16:47.551 --> 16:49.551
Looks like David didn't
get the no pet memo.

16:51.448 --> 16:52.206
Hmm.

16:53.344 --> 16:55.379
Who's been
feeding the fish?

16:55.379 --> 16:56.827
I live off-property.

16:56.827 --> 16:57.689
Couldn't tell you.

17:04.310 --> 17:05.241
Someone's expecting.

17:21.896 --> 17:22.793
What've you got, pal?

17:43.172 --> 17:44.862
<i>I've got good
news or bad news-</i>

17:44.862 --> 17:46.137
<i>depending on how
your day went.</i>

17:52.310 --> 17:53.241
Aluminum shavings.

17:53.241 --> 17:54.275
<i>Looks like it
could be a match</i>-

17:54.275 --> 17:54.965
<i>to the accelerant bomb.</i>

17:54.965 --> 17:56.655
But I'll have
to test it.

17:57.172 --> 17:58.137
You found these where?

17:58.137 --> 18:00.000
In David's apartment.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.655
<i>Looks like he is
a part of this.</i>

18:01.655 --> 18:03.689
Reva may have
been right.

18:04.724 --> 18:06.000
<i>Well, we
can't say the same.</i>

18:07.448 --> 18:09.689
Sarah and I each conducted
the DNA testing again.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.448
And results-

18:10.448 --> 18:12.413
are still inconclusive.

18:12.517 --> 18:13.379
Sorry.

18:13.379 --> 18:14.103
<i>No.</i>

18:14.103 --> 18:15.448
No, it's not
that we failed.

18:15.448 --> 18:16.689
It's literally impossible.

18:17.931 --> 18:18.620
There's no
conceivable way-

18:18.620 --> 18:20.241
that Reva pulled
David's DNA.

18:20.241 --> 18:22.275
But she presented
a DNA match.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.655
How is that possible?

18:23.655 --> 18:24.896
<i>Well-</i>

18:24.896 --> 18:27.000
the Defense was ready to
spring David on us at the trial.

18:28.206 --> 18:30.862
I wonder if Reva
lied under oath.

18:35.517 --> 18:38.000
I hope you didn't call us down
here to intimidate my client.

18:38.793 --> 18:40.034
<i>No I can
assure you not.</i>

18:41.793 --> 18:42.862
From what
emerged in court-

18:42.862 --> 18:45.379
we are now officially
looking into David Gallo.

18:45.379 --> 18:46.965
<i>Any idea why-</i>

18:46.965 --> 18:48.034
he might have targeted
your business?

18:50.551 --> 18:52.689
Well he used
to be a regular-

18:52.689 --> 18:53.655
before prison-

18:53.655 --> 18:54.551
<i>did a number
on him.</i>

18:54.551 --> 18:55.275
What do you mean?

18:55.965 --> 18:58.103
He had a
short fuse.

18:58.103 --> 18:59.896
Started picking fights.

18:59.896 --> 19:03.586
We had to ban him two
weeks before the fire.

19:03.586 --> 19:05.448
That's why he
torched the place?

19:05.448 --> 19:06.448
Well-

19:06.448 --> 19:08.275
It's not easy being
kicked out of paradise.

19:11.793 --> 19:12.896
Yeah, um-

19:12.896 --> 19:16.551
this was taken two
days before the fire.

19:16.551 --> 19:18.137
That's David Gallo, right?

19:18.137 --> 19:19.482
Detective Hudson, careful.

19:19.482 --> 19:21.068
We don't have
to be here.

19:21.068 --> 19:23.586
Just trying to establish
a timeline for our suspect.

19:24.344 --> 19:26.172
Security must have
been lax that night.

19:27.344 --> 19:28.586
Maybe he was
scoping out the place.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.793
Except those are the
<i>Employees Only</i> stairs.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.310
We checked on
the floor plan.

19:33.862 --> 19:34.655
It's the same place-

19:34.655 --> 19:36.344
where Kieran McCall,
arms dealer-

19:36.344 --> 19:37.586
<i>once headed.</i>

19:37.689 --> 19:39.275
A corrupt port authority.

19:39.275 --> 19:40.137
<i>Oh and-</i>

19:40.137 --> 19:41.586
<i>a contraband
tobacco smuggler.</i>

19:41.586 --> 19:42.413
Alright, Hudson.

19:42.413 --> 19:43.620
I don't like where
this is headed.

19:43.620 --> 19:45.862
Doesn't feel like Gallo should
be going up those stairs-

19:45.862 --> 19:46.896
unless he was
on the payroll.

19:46.896 --> 19:47.586
Does it?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.034
If you really
believe that-

19:51.206 --> 19:52.517
good luck proving it.

19:52.517 --> 19:53.793
We'll see you
on Monday.

19:54.310 --> 19:56.931
It's just not possible Reva
came to that conclusion-

19:56.931 --> 19:57.965
with her methodology.

19:59.551 --> 20:02.448
I think she was led to that
conclusion by the defense.

20:02.448 --> 20:04.000
<i>Which means
they were counting on us-</i>

20:04.000 --> 20:06.068
not being able to
connect Gallo to this fire.

20:06.068 --> 20:07.896
They had a ready-made scapegoat
prepared to throw the case.

20:08.724 --> 20:10.241
That seems far-fetched.

20:11.413 --> 20:12.965
Uh- don't say fetch.

20:12.965 --> 20:14.172
Can you prove
any of this?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.586
Or is it just
a hunch?

20:15.586 --> 20:16.655
No it is not
a hunch.

20:16.931 --> 20:18.137
It's a theory.

20:18.137 --> 20:19.275
<i>So you expect me-</i>

20:19.275 --> 20:20.206
to walk into
court tomorrow-

20:20.206 --> 20:22.310
crying collusion and
falsifying evidence?

20:22.310 --> 20:24.310
With nothing
to back it up?

20:24.310 --> 20:25.448
We are going
to prove it.

20:25.448 --> 20:26.241
Just give us time.

20:27.689 --> 20:29.379
24 hours is all
the time we have.

20:32.655 --> 20:33.896
Sorry.

20:33.896 --> 20:35.310
So how are we
going to prove it?

20:35.310 --> 20:37.413
There's no paper trail
between David and Gene.

20:37.413 --> 20:38.655
Maybe we don't
have to find one.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.551
If we can prove Reva
falsified evidence-

20:40.551 --> 20:42.586
then the case falls
apart right?

20:42.586 --> 20:45.137
Uh- leave
that with me.

20:45.137 --> 20:46.551
It's a big if Sarah.

20:46.551 --> 20:47.413
We need to
attack this-

20:47.413 --> 20:48.724
from every angle.

20:48.724 --> 20:50.448
What if we can find
someone in David's life-

20:50.448 --> 20:53.206
who can speak to
their relationship?

20:53.206 --> 20:54.310
I called the hospital-

20:54.310 --> 20:56.000
that performed that
ultrasound you found, Charlie.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.793
Here's the list of all the women
who had appointments that day.

21:00.137 --> 21:02.482
I know exactly who
we're looking for.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.620
I think we have
something of yours.

21:26.482 --> 21:28.482
Amanda.

21:28.482 --> 21:30.655
What was this doing
at David's apartment?

21:33.103 --> 21:35.724
David asked to
see the sonogram.

21:35.724 --> 21:37.793
We became pretty close
over his probation.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.482
I'd say you became
more than close.

21:39.482 --> 21:40.586
<i>He would have been-</i>

21:40.586 --> 21:43.793
the first person
to see this.

21:43.793 --> 21:45.034
He had a check-
in with you-

21:45.034 --> 21:46.862
a half an hour after
this appointment.

21:46.862 --> 21:47.827
David's the father.

21:47.827 --> 21:49.000
Isn't he?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.551
When David got out,
no one believed in him.

21:57.655 --> 22:01.068
Everyone here was just
waiting for him to reoffend.

22:01.068 --> 22:04.034
There was something tender in
him if you looked a bit deeper.

22:06.344 --> 22:07.344
<i>It's clear you
cared about him.</i>

22:09.758 --> 22:12.379
That's why I need you to
be honest with me now.

22:12.379 --> 22:14.758
<i>What else
are you hiding?</i>

22:14.758 --> 22:17.034
The day of
the ultrasound-

22:17.034 --> 22:19.655
he told me he was worried
about providing for us.

22:21.137 --> 22:22.827
And he told me
he had a job.

22:24.137 --> 22:25.689
The Tropiks fire?

22:25.689 --> 22:27.379
I didn't care to
hear the details.

22:27.379 --> 22:29.103
But I told him that if
he did anything stupid-

22:29.103 --> 22:30.517
he'd be out of
our lives for good.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.379
He may have still
taken the job.

22:32.379 --> 22:35.620
We found some material
in his apartment-

22:35.620 --> 22:37.068
that matched the
accelerant bomb.

22:37.448 --> 22:38.172
No.

22:39.241 --> 22:40.344
He told me
he'd refused-

22:40.344 --> 22:41.965
<i>to do it.</i>

22:41.965 --> 22:44.310
But that he needed to disappear
for a while to stay safe.

22:45.034 --> 22:46.862
And in the meantime,
you kept the fish fed.

22:46.862 --> 22:50.034
He promised he'd be back in
time for his next check-in.

22:50.034 --> 22:52.448
Even after we filed the
warrant for his arrest-

22:54.517 --> 22:56.379
I was hoping that
he'd come back-

22:57.551 --> 22:58.758
until yesterday.

23:05.827 --> 23:06.862
What is he doing?

23:14.172 --> 23:15.310
He's on to something.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.344
What have
you got pal?

23:31.344 --> 23:33.758
Of course you found the one
item in this office of his.

23:38.034 --> 23:40.068
He told me to keep
them safe in case-

23:40.068 --> 23:41.413
<i>he need them
for insurance.</i>

23:47.655 --> 23:50.000
We have bomb components
at David's house-

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
and proof that he was
commissioned for a crime-

23:52.000 --> 23:53.241
before the fire.

23:53.586 --> 23:55.724
So why do we not have
everything we need?

23:55.724 --> 23:57.344
We still can't prove
definitively-

23:57.344 --> 23:58.620
that Gene hired him.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.206
I wish it was
that simple.

24:01.344 --> 24:03.379
But I think I believe
Amanda too.

24:03.379 --> 24:04.586
Because he didn't
go through with it?

24:04.586 --> 24:06.896
Not after he found out
he had a baby on the way.

24:06.896 --> 24:08.310
<i>Wait, okay so-</i>

24:08.310 --> 24:09.379
if we want to
believe Reva-

24:09.379 --> 24:11.241
how did he end
up in that fire?

24:11.241 --> 24:12.896
I think he might've
been murdered.

24:14.172 --> 24:16.103
Because he backed
out of the job?

24:16.103 --> 24:17.551
Or for his silence.

24:17.551 --> 24:20.482
Amanda said that David
gave her these as insurance.

24:20.482 --> 24:22.827
Maybe it was for
leverage against Gene-

24:22.827 --> 24:24.241
for whatever he was
using them for.

24:24.344 --> 24:26.172
That won't hold up
in court Charlie.

24:26.172 --> 24:28.862
Or maybe it was for
Amanda and the baby?

24:28.862 --> 24:30.413
Because if was looking
for a payday, those chips-

24:30.413 --> 24:31.655
could be worth
a lot of money.

24:31.655 --> 24:32.862
<i>The part that
doesn't make sense-</i>

24:32.862 --> 24:34.068
is why would Jean
let them burn?

24:34.068 --> 24:35.586
<i>Well-</i>

24:36.241 --> 24:37.068
they're junk.

24:37.965 --> 24:38.689
I'm sorry?

24:38.689 --> 24:40.137
Yeah, I tested
dozens of these.

24:40.137 --> 24:41.620
None of them
have a current.

24:41.620 --> 24:42.965
They're less than worthless.

24:44.827 --> 24:48.827
Because this was never
about the nightclub.

24:52.034 --> 24:53.551
Gene was stuck
with faulty product.

24:54.655 --> 24:55.965
You think he was
selling contraband?

24:55.965 --> 24:57.103
If he's a contraband
merchant-

24:57.103 --> 24:58.551
these numbers
would make sense.

24:59.482 --> 25:00.551
Yeah.

25:00.551 --> 25:02.241
Financial Crimes have
all these large deposits-

25:02.241 --> 25:03.275
<i>highlighted on
their spreadsheets.</i>

25:03.275 --> 25:04.689
<i>I didn't know what
they were before.</i>

25:09.689 --> 25:11.000
<i>Thank you so much-</i>

25:11.000 --> 25:12.413
for coming.

25:12.413 --> 25:14.241
Oh it's my pleasure!

25:14.241 --> 25:17.793
Though do I have to remind you
that there's a case ongoing?

25:17.793 --> 25:19.862
So I can't help
you too much.

25:19.862 --> 25:23.103
Well this is for a separate
investigation on David Gallo.

25:23.103 --> 25:24.689
Getting your statement
would be very helpful-

25:24.689 --> 25:26.655
since my results
came up short.

25:29.413 --> 25:31.103
It's big of you to admit
that you were wrong.

25:31.103 --> 25:32.586
<i>I also-</i>

25:32.586 --> 25:35.379
was thinking about what
you said the other night.

25:35.379 --> 25:36.517
about this job being-

25:37.517 --> 25:38.482
you know-

25:38.482 --> 25:39.586
beneath me.

25:40.241 --> 25:43.034
Do you get to travel
for work a lot?

25:43.034 --> 25:44.379
Yeah, someone hires us.

25:44.379 --> 25:45.758
We go consult.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.000
What are you looking
to make a change?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.034
It'd just be an awfully
nice way to see the world.

25:50.034 --> 25:51.586
<i>You didn't-</i>

25:51.586 --> 25:54.379
test the evidence
out in Toronto?

25:54.379 --> 25:55.793
No, I can get
access to a lab-

25:55.793 --> 25:57.206
pretty much anywhere
in the world.

25:57.206 --> 25:58.310
<i>It's tricky here though-</i>

25:58.310 --> 25:59.793
<i>with just the
one worth using.</i>

25:59.793 --> 26:01.034
Kernwell Research Centre?

26:01.034 --> 26:02.034
No, God no.

26:02.034 --> 26:02.724
AtlanTech Labs.

26:05.448 --> 26:06.586
Oh okay.

26:06.586 --> 26:07.931
So this officer will take
you to get your statement.

26:07.931 --> 26:09.000
<i>Great.</i>

26:10.551 --> 26:13.206
And I will keep an
eye out for openings.

26:23.793 --> 26:24.448
Jesse?

26:24.448 --> 26:25.379
It's AtlanTech Labs.

26:26.206 --> 26:27.724
Get me anything
you can find.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.103
Clock's ticking.

26:38.551 --> 26:39.620
You get your
guy yet?

26:40.689 --> 26:42.413
Vanessa, Major Crimes
is trying to help you.

26:43.758 --> 26:45.931
And it's not going to reflect
well on Financial Crimes either-

26:45.931 --> 26:48.862
if this case falls
apart now.

26:48.862 --> 26:51.034
<i>But if you
get the win-</i>

26:51.034 --> 26:53.482
I doubt if you'd
share it with us.

26:53.482 --> 26:55.103
That doesn't seem
fair, does it?

26:55.965 --> 26:58.379
So let me get
this straight.

26:58.379 --> 27:00.517
It's more important
for my team to fail-

27:00.517 --> 27:01.586
than to get
Gene Powell?

27:03.068 --> 27:04.862
What exactly
is going on here?

27:04.862 --> 27:05.689
<i>Don't play dumb.</i>

27:05.689 --> 27:08.931
The Chief is
talking retirement.

27:08.931 --> 27:11.379
So your scooping
our case-

27:11.379 --> 27:13.620
is just a move to start
campaigning for the job.

27:13.620 --> 27:15.758
That's news to me.

27:15.758 --> 27:17.448
And what makes you think
I'd even want that job?

27:17.448 --> 27:18.551
Who wouldn't?

27:18.551 --> 27:20.241
Never even
crossed my mind.

27:20.965 --> 27:22.034
Mmmm.

27:24.068 --> 27:25.275
The only thing-

27:25.275 --> 27:28.586
<i>that is on my plate right
now is getting Gene Powell.</i>

27:28.586 --> 27:29.793
And I need
your help.

27:31.172 --> 27:33.000
Please.

27:34.206 --> 27:35.793
That's all
you had to say.

27:37.758 --> 27:39.517
My team has been after
Gene Powell for years.

27:39.517 --> 27:41.551
There was an influx
of contraband in town.

27:41.551 --> 27:43.965
And the merchants seemed to
have only one thing in common.

27:43.965 --> 27:45.034
They went through Tropiks.

27:45.034 --> 27:46.275
Exactly.

27:46.275 --> 27:48.448
Now we couldn't tell how Gene
was involved in the scheme.

27:48.448 --> 27:50.310
But the club was
a hub of activity.

27:50.310 --> 27:52.310
And clearly he was
getting kickbacks.

27:52.310 --> 27:55.103
I mean I couldn't trace any
of these massive deposits.

27:55.103 --> 27:56.137
So he was just
a middleman?

27:56.137 --> 27:57.103
<i>No.</i>

27:57.103 --> 27:59.000
Not with the kind of
money he had coming in.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.793
I mean that's
a healthy cut.

28:00.793 --> 28:05.413
What if he was paid
in advance by the buyer?

28:05.517 --> 28:06.517
But the chips
were faulty.

28:06.517 --> 28:07.827
Which-

28:07.827 --> 28:09.758
Which means that he'd be on the
hook for millions to somebody.

28:09.758 --> 28:11.931
Yeah, which is why
the nightclub had to go-

28:11.931 --> 28:13.206
and take the
chips with it.

28:13.206 --> 28:16.000
And if David wasn't going
to help with the problem-

28:16.000 --> 28:17.620
maybe he
needed to go too.

28:17.620 --> 28:18.965
With fatherhood
on the horizon-

28:18.965 --> 28:20.172
he could have
been threatening-

28:20.172 --> 28:21.517
to come clean
about all this stuff.

28:22.793 --> 28:24.034
Yeah, it all
makes sense.

28:24.586 --> 28:25.758
How are we
going to prove it-

28:25.758 --> 28:27.310
before the trial
resumes tomorrow?

28:28.482 --> 28:29.344
We may not
have to.

28:34.275 --> 28:35.000
Hey.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.413
You got
something for me?

28:36.413 --> 28:37.413
<i>Yeah just the CCTV-</i>

28:37.413 --> 28:39.586
from the lab where Reva
was running her tests.

28:49.413 --> 28:50.275
<i>Special delivery.</i>

28:50.275 --> 28:51.275
You were right.

28:51.275 --> 28:52.344
That doesn't look
like court evidence.

28:53.344 --> 28:54.448
But that package-

28:54.448 --> 28:57.068
doesn't exactly read David
Gallo's DNA on it either.

28:58.482 --> 29:00.586
It's not enough to prove
our collusion theory.

29:00.586 --> 29:01.827
Yeah but who's
doing the drop off?

29:01.827 --> 29:03.758
That might be of
interest to you.

29:09.655 --> 29:10.793
<i>Gene's lawyer.</i>

29:11.310 --> 29:12.551
I need to
borrow Rex.

29:23.103 --> 29:24.241
Sarah Truong.

29:25.034 --> 29:26.068
Ten years, no call.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.655
And now I hear from you
three times in a weekend.

29:29.379 --> 29:30.517
And you are-?

29:30.620 --> 29:31.551
Detective Hudson.

29:31.655 --> 29:32.827
<i>And this is
my partner.</i>

29:32.827 --> 29:33.724
Rex!

29:33.724 --> 29:34.413
<i>Yes yes!</i>

29:34.413 --> 29:35.689
<i>So I've heard.</i>

29:35.689 --> 29:39.620
We stopped by David Gallo's
apartment to get a scent sample.

29:39.620 --> 29:41.034
Reva, have
a close look.

29:41.034 --> 29:43.344
I want to show you what
picking up after a dog-

29:43.344 --> 29:45.379
<i>really looks like.</i>

29:46.310 --> 29:47.068
Track it!

29:53.620 --> 29:54.689
Oh!

29:54.689 --> 29:55.379
Yeah cute.

29:55.379 --> 29:56.103
He does tricks.

29:56.103 --> 29:56.793
Okay okay.

29:56.793 --> 29:57.827
Get him out
of my rental.

30:00.793 --> 30:02.275
Picking up the scent
of a dead man.

30:02.275 --> 30:04.000
<i>That is a pretty
cool trick.</i>

30:06.931 --> 30:08.655
We have CCTV footage-

30:09.620 --> 30:11.172
<i>of you accepting-</i>

30:11.172 --> 30:13.068
this package from
Avery Creehan.

30:13.068 --> 30:14.413
Right here.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.758
<i>We expected to find it
ditched somewhere in the area.</i>

30:15.758 --> 30:17.655
But you were kind
enough to hang on to it.

30:17.655 --> 30:18.862
What was inside?

30:18.862 --> 30:21.448
Just some papers
for my services.

30:21.448 --> 30:22.310
What are you
getting at?

30:23.413 --> 30:25.034
Reva, we can take this
back to my lab to confirm.

30:25.034 --> 30:26.379
Or you can
come clean.

30:26.379 --> 30:27.758
<i>Did the Defense
give you-</i>

30:27.758 --> 30:29.931
something of
David Gallo's to test?

30:32.172 --> 30:35.103
I think you and I need to
go somewhere private.

30:35.103 --> 30:36.310
I want to
talk this over.

30:45.896 --> 30:47.482
I knew you couldn't have
pulled David's identity-

30:47.482 --> 30:48.551
from that evidence.

30:48.551 --> 30:49.724
You lied!

30:49.724 --> 30:51.068
I didn't.

30:51.068 --> 30:54.827
I told you I tested
what they gave me.

30:54.827 --> 30:57.379
You falsified evidence
on the stand.

30:57.379 --> 30:59.724
And was David Gallo
not the man in the fire?

30:59.724 --> 31:02.137
Didn't your little dog just
confirm that that was true?

31:02.137 --> 31:03.482
But how did
he get there?

31:03.482 --> 31:05.137
<i>A criminal
is about to-</i>

31:05.137 --> 31:07.000
let an innocent man
burn for his crimes.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.034
You're okay with
letting that happen?

31:10.931 --> 31:12.034
I made a
call for you.

31:12.793 --> 31:14.344
What call?

31:14.344 --> 31:16.413
There's a senior forensic
associate position-

31:16.413 --> 31:17.827
waiting for you
in Toronto.

31:17.931 --> 31:18.862
<i>Better hours.</i>

31:18.862 --> 31:19.896
<i>Better pay.</i>

31:19.896 --> 31:21.000
<i>And best of all-</i>

31:21.000 --> 31:21.965
none of this.

31:22.344 --> 31:24.068
Once court adjourns-

31:24.068 --> 31:26.310
you don't have to take
the case home with you.

31:26.310 --> 31:27.379
<i>Sarah, what
do you think-</i>

31:27.379 --> 31:29.310
<i>is going to happen
in court tomorrow?</i>

31:29.310 --> 31:31.137
I know that you can't
prove any of this.

31:31.137 --> 31:33.068
Otherwise you wouldn't be
chasing after me right now.

31:35.448 --> 31:37.137
I guess I'll just have
to take the stand and-

31:38.551 --> 31:40.034
tell the truth.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.482
Don't you think the truth
is for the jury to decide?

31:45.655 --> 31:46.620
You're right.

31:50.103 --> 31:51.344
I'll see you
in the morning.

32:08.310 --> 32:10.241
Hey, you headed
to the trial?

32:10.241 --> 32:11.793
Yeah.

32:11.793 --> 32:13.034
Nothing more
we can do now.

32:13.034 --> 32:15.206
Yeah sometimes it's worse
to have half the story-

32:15.206 --> 32:16.241
and no way
to prove it.

32:16.241 --> 32:17.482
It's frustrating-

32:17.482 --> 32:19.655
to be stuck in limbo
after all this effort.

32:19.655 --> 32:21.586
Well I'll just have
to take the stand-

32:21.586 --> 32:25.586
and tell the jury I wasn't
able to replicate the tests.

32:31.586 --> 32:33.310
<i>What's up?</i>

32:33.310 --> 32:34.793
What is it?

32:36.862 --> 32:38.413
He's got something.

32:39.793 --> 32:40.827
He must be tracking
David's remains-

32:40.827 --> 32:42.931
from the scents
in his apartment.

32:42.931 --> 32:45.172
Charlie, this is the
debris that I sorted out-

32:45.172 --> 32:47.000
looking for bone samples
that we may have missed.

32:48.965 --> 32:50.620
There's got to
be something.

32:52.379 --> 32:53.482
Good job pal.

33:16.758 --> 33:18.275
<i>Sarah, I need
you to come with me.</i>

33:18.275 --> 33:19.172
<i>I think
there's a way-</i>

33:19.172 --> 33:20.206
to save this
case after all.

33:20.206 --> 33:20.896
Rex.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.896
That substrate definitely
looks like a match-

33:34.896 --> 33:36.275
to what we've
got in the morgue.

33:36.275 --> 33:38.068
There's also
something in there.

33:46.793 --> 33:48.275
You might need
to dig it out.

33:55.172 --> 33:55.896
<i>Oh.</i>

33:57.379 --> 33:59.620
Well I only know two men
who'd wear a ring this flashy.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.482
And I don't think it
belongs to Harry Styles.

34:01.482 --> 34:03.758
I think David was
drowned by Gene right here.

34:05.517 --> 34:07.379
That's going to
be hard to prove.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.620
I think I have an
idea where to start.

34:19.482 --> 34:20.379
<i>Your honour.</i>

34:20.379 --> 34:21.482
<i>It's not every day-</i>

34:21.482 --> 34:23.379
you get to see the rationale
for a warrant firsthand.

34:23.379 --> 34:24.827
Make it quick.

34:24.827 --> 34:27.724
So we suspect that the body
of David Gallo was transported-

34:27.724 --> 34:29.655
<i>in a vehicle
somewhere on this lot.</i>

34:29.655 --> 34:30.827
If we're right-

34:30.827 --> 34:32.448
Rex should be able to lead
us right to that vehicle.

34:32.448 --> 34:33.137
All right Rex.

34:33.137 --> 34:33.896
<i>Track it.</i>

35:04.655 --> 35:05.758
Thank you.

35:06.172 --> 35:06.862
Hey.

35:06.862 --> 35:08.413
I need you guys
down here now.

35:08.413 --> 35:09.689
Okay.

35:10.448 --> 35:11.137
What's going on here?

35:11.137 --> 35:12.000
<i>I need you
to stall-</i>

35:12.000 --> 35:13.827
for as long
as you can.

35:13.827 --> 35:14.965
Sarah, this is it.

35:14.965 --> 35:15.965
We're out of time.

35:15.965 --> 35:17.689
Look, you asked us to
get you a conviction.

35:17.689 --> 35:18.793
I can get you
the evidence.

35:19.586 --> 35:20.896
You just need
to trust me.

35:22.344 --> 35:24.034
Yeah, I trust you.

35:26.551 --> 35:27.206
Thank you.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.000
You guys better not be
hanging me out to dry.

35:48.000 --> 35:48.758
No no.

35:48.758 --> 35:49.827
Sarah knows
what she's doing.

36:07.586 --> 36:08.551
Don't hover.

36:08.551 --> 36:09.896
I'm not hovering.

36:11.482 --> 36:12.724
Rex.

36:16.482 --> 36:20.655
Science demands patience.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.620
<i>All rise!</i>

36:29.655 --> 36:30.724
Good morning.

36:31.103 --> 36:31.793
Welcome back.

36:31.793 --> 36:34.034
<i>Court is now
in session.</i>

36:34.862 --> 36:36.655
<i>Please take your seats.</i>

36:54.793 --> 36:57.310
We're not ready for
closing arguments?

36:57.310 --> 36:58.103
Your honour.

36:58.103 --> 37:00.965
In light of last
week's revelation-

37:00.965 --> 37:06.068
I motion to call
a final witness.

37:06.724 --> 37:07.620
Granted.

37:07.620 --> 37:10.758
I call Jesse Mills
to the stand.

37:10.758 --> 37:11.586
What?

37:23.551 --> 37:24.206
Find Jesse.

37:32.758 --> 37:37.482
Jesse Mills, what exactly
is your role at the SJPD?

37:37.482 --> 37:40.551
Well, I'm a Fourth
Class Constable.

37:41.620 --> 37:43.068
And Tech Analyst.

37:43.068 --> 37:44.655
Like- you know.

37:44.655 --> 37:46.413
A tech detective.

37:51.517 --> 37:53.206
A tech-tective,
I say sometimes.

37:53.206 --> 37:54.103
<i>Objection.</i>

37:54.103 --> 37:56.551
This witness has no
relevance to the case.

37:56.551 --> 37:57.793
No, let me
get to it.

37:57.793 --> 37:58.551
I'm relevant!

37:58.655 --> 37:59.551
<i>I'm relevant!</i>

38:05.551 --> 38:06.379
Okay I'll
tell you why.

38:07.689 --> 38:08.931
A team needs
a foundation.

38:08.931 --> 38:10.689
<i>And some would say-</i>

38:10.793 --> 38:12.137
<i>that analysts
are invaluable.</i>

38:12.137 --> 38:13.275
<i>People call me
lightning fingers.</i>

38:18.482 --> 38:19.793
Order!

38:21.448 --> 38:22.620
Order!

38:25.172 --> 38:26.655
Good boy.

38:26.655 --> 38:27.517
<i>Thanks.</i>

38:31.689 --> 38:35.206
Your honour, I'd like
to recall a witness.

38:35.206 --> 38:36.379
<i>Dr. Truong.</i>

38:36.379 --> 38:37.655
<i>Were you able to
generate a test-</i>

38:37.655 --> 38:39.344
that positively ID'd
David Gallo?

38:39.344 --> 38:40.344
I was.

38:40.344 --> 38:44.586
I submit the following
as Exhibit 73-B.

38:44.586 --> 38:45.862
<i>Now these results-</i>

38:45.862 --> 38:47.241
<i>did not come from
the arson site.</i>

38:48.551 --> 38:50.379
My colleague, Dr.
Karma Poole and I-

38:50.379 --> 38:53.758
both tried to replicate
Dr. Warner's results-

38:53.758 --> 38:55.137
<i>to little success.</i>

38:55.137 --> 38:56.931
<i>In fact-</i>

38:56.931 --> 38:58.275
it's impossible.

38:59.241 --> 39:01.000
<i>How do you reckon
Dr. Warner was able-</i>

39:01.000 --> 39:01.931
to present those results-

39:01.931 --> 39:04.206
to this court,
last week.

39:04.206 --> 39:06.965
She would have required a
stronger sample to test-

39:06.965 --> 39:07.931
as I had here-

39:07.931 --> 39:09.758
<i>with this sample.</i>

39:09.862 --> 39:12.620
And where did your sample
come from Dr. Truong?

39:12.620 --> 39:15.275
From the trunk of
the defendant's car-

39:15.275 --> 39:16.482
collected just this morning.

39:16.482 --> 39:17.758
<i>which was found-</i>

39:17.758 --> 39:19.206
<i>along with mineral-
enriched water-</i>

39:19.206 --> 39:20.655
<i>from the aquarium
in which-</i>

39:20.655 --> 39:21.827
David was drowned.

39:21.827 --> 39:22.517
<i>Objection!</i>

39:23.379 --> 39:24.793
Overruled.

39:24.793 --> 39:26.862
<i>David Gallo couldn't
have set that fire.</i>

39:26.862 --> 39:28.896
He wasn't alive-

39:28.896 --> 39:31.241
when he reached the
nightclub with Gene Powell.

39:37.758 --> 39:39.344
I want to see all
the attorneys-

39:39.344 --> 39:40.413
in my chamber.

39:40.413 --> 39:41.275
Now!

39:54.793 --> 39:55.655
<i>Hey.</i>

39:58.379 --> 39:59.793
You should have
seen Avery-

39:59.793 --> 40:01.172
shaking like a leaf.

40:02.310 --> 40:05.000
Unsurprisingly,
Gene change his plea.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.172
But given what's
come to light-

40:06.172 --> 40:07.896
we are pursuing first-
degree murder charges.

40:08.655 --> 40:09.275
Wow.

40:09.275 --> 40:10.413
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:10.413 --> 40:13.206
<i>I hope you'll be available
to testify then too.</i>

40:13.206 --> 40:15.586
Well that almost
sounds like an apology.

40:15.586 --> 40:16.448
<i>But it's just-</i>

40:17.413 --> 40:18.379
missing something.

40:18.379 --> 40:19.517
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

40:20.137 --> 40:21.206
Sarah.

40:21.758 --> 40:23.000
I'm sorry for
doubting you.

40:23.862 --> 40:24.551
There it is.

40:24.551 --> 40:25.482
<i>Yeah.</i>

40:27.655 --> 40:30.413
Yeah, I'll admit that-

40:30.413 --> 40:32.896
<i>it hasn't been
easy to-</i>

40:34.448 --> 40:37.344
<i>adjust to a working relationship.</i>

40:38.931 --> 40:39.896
We'll get there.

40:48.413 --> 40:50.068
I'll take the stand
whenever you need.

40:59.137 --> 41:00.068
<i>We couldn't have
solved this without you.</i>

41:00.068 --> 41:01.275
<i>Oh!</i>

41:01.275 --> 41:02.689
That's what I've been
trying to tell you all along.

41:02.689 --> 41:04.103
Nice of you
to admit it.

41:04.103 --> 41:06.034
Which is why I'm
giving the Powell case-

41:06.034 --> 41:07.413
back over to
Financial Crimes.

41:07.413 --> 41:08.793
With Major
Crimes on hand-

41:08.793 --> 41:10.586
to assist if you
need us, of course.

41:10.586 --> 41:12.517
You guys have been chasing
this guy long enough.

41:12.517 --> 41:15.137
Your team deserves to take
it across the finish line.

41:15.137 --> 41:17.379
Thank you,
Superintendent Donovan.

41:18.931 --> 41:21.344
I just hope that there
are no hard feelings-

41:21.344 --> 41:22.862
when the chief job
comes calling.

41:27.448 --> 41:29.310
Well that was the
right thing to do-

41:29.310 --> 41:30.379
taking the hit.

41:31.827 --> 41:33.689
You know what the chief
loves more than a big win?

41:34.724 --> 41:36.896
Interdepartmental collaboration.

41:38.448 --> 41:40.137
The race for the
job is not over.

41:46.724 --> 41:49.689
Well, the Judge is throwing
out my testimony-

41:49.689 --> 41:51.344
<i>after that
little display.</i>

41:51.344 --> 41:53.551
So I guess we're
even now, Truong.

41:53.655 --> 41:55.965
Uh, for what?

41:57.034 --> 41:58.965
Getting the high paying job
over you back in the day.

41:59.965 --> 42:01.137
Not that it
matters now.

42:01.137 --> 42:03.344
But since you
mentioned it-

42:03.344 --> 42:05.206
Sutherland Schmidt
offered me that internship.

42:06.344 --> 42:07.793
I turned it down.

42:08.931 --> 42:11.172
Sour grapes, Sarah.

42:11.172 --> 42:12.137
That's not a
great look.

42:13.517 --> 42:14.482
I'm serious Reva.

42:14.482 --> 42:16.275
I'm not interested
in payback.

42:17.793 --> 42:19.827
I'm a scientist-

42:19.827 --> 42:21.413
<i>which is why
I've reported you-</i>

42:21.413 --> 42:24.655
to the Society of
Canadian Forensic Analysts-

42:24.655 --> 42:27.310
for taking conclusions from
clients and falsifying reports.

42:32.275 --> 42:33.620
Okay wow!

42:34.827 --> 42:36.241
If that's how you
want to play it-

42:37.862 --> 42:39.000
I will see
you in court.

42:39.689 --> 42:40.620
Not likely!

42:42.827 --> 42:44.034
That must
have felt good.

42:44.034 --> 42:46.931
You have no idea!

42:50.310 --> 42:51.689
Thanks Rex.

42:51.689 --> 42:52.482
Hey.
