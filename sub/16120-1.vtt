00:35.600 --> 00:39.491
* My daddy
made no excuse *

00:39.540 --> 00:42.407
* I believe my lies
are truth *

00:42.440 --> 00:46.729
* Why won't you eat
what you're fed? *

00:48.580 --> 00:51.845
* 'Cause
when I touch myself *

00:51.880 --> 00:54.713
* I think of only you

00:54.750 --> 00:59.380
* And when I touch
someone else *

00:59.420 --> 01:04.289
* No one is faithful

01:04.330 --> 01:08.221
* I am weak,
I'll go astray *

01:11.700 --> 01:17.229
* Forgive me
for my ways *

01:18.640 --> 01:23.179
* No one is faithful

01:25.310 --> 01:29.815
* No one is faithful

01:29.850 --> 01:32.853
* I am weak

01:43.370 --> 01:46.362
* Can't stand
to be alone *

01:46.400 --> 01:48.698
* 'Cause emptiness

01:48.740 --> 01:52.471
* Is all
I've ever known *

01:52.510 --> 01:55.229
* Soiled by my lust

01:55.280 --> 01:58.909
* I feel no shame

01:58.950 --> 02:01.510
* No longer forsaken

02:01.550 --> 02:05.543
* When they call my name

02:05.590 --> 02:10.584
* Beautiful angels
come to my bed *

02:12.400 --> 02:14.356
* I'm satisfied

02:14.400 --> 02:16.527
* On the flesh I fed

02:16.570 --> 02:21.360
* No one is faithful

02:21.400 --> 02:26.303
* I am weak,
I'll go astray *

02:28.540 --> 02:33.614
* Forgive me
for my ways *

02:35.680 --> 02:40.219
* No one is faithful

02:42.290 --> 02:45.179
* No one is faithful...

02:49.800 --> 02:51.495
Be good.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.236
I won't tell you
the same.

02:53.270 --> 02:55.192
Hm. You know better.

03:00.780 --> 03:03.840
( children's voices
overlapping )

03:32.440 --> 03:34.579
Pop, we want
another churro.

03:34.610 --> 03:36.544
Four for a dollar,
buddy. You got
two more.

03:36.580 --> 03:37.979
Those are yours
though.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.649
Nah, you have them.
Just take it easy, okay?

03:40.680 --> 03:43.615
- Okay.
- Okay, listen to me.

03:43.650 --> 03:47.518
Listen. Now,
every time these men
finish five plays,

03:47.560 --> 03:49.926
you and Kenya
have a churro.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.622
Five plays, Blue.
See if you can be
disciplined.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.857
Didn't we talk
about discipline,
remember?

03:55.900 --> 03:57.595
Come here.

03:57.630 --> 04:00.599
Sit down.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.699
- How many plays?
- Five plays.

04:02.740 --> 04:04.503
Five plays,
then churros.

04:04.540 --> 04:06.007
That's my boy.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.531
Mm.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.639
Don't move.

04:11.780 --> 04:13.873
There's your churros.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.819
Radio DJ:
Comin' at ya, hot,
on this cool red mornin',

04:20.860 --> 04:24.023
They got us here at KCEW,
New Orleans

04:24.060 --> 04:26.426
with the best _
and newest musrc.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.759
The next song
is by a local man
in Plaquemines Parish

04:29.800 --> 04:32.735
reppin' the 985
with a fresh track.

04:32.770 --> 04:34.897
Peace and love,
New Orleans.
Check it.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.033
- ( music playing )
- Pop: All right, man.

04:37.070 --> 04:40.836
- Man: A'ight. What's up, man?
- Man #2: What's up, Ralph?

04:43.680 --> 04:46.274
( doorbell chimes )

04:48.850 --> 04:50.818
( doorbell jingles )

05:11.710 --> 05:13.302
( sighs )

05:24.590 --> 05:26.785
( cash register beeps )

05:30.130 --> 05:32.052
Give it to me.

05:32.090 --> 05:34.024
( scoffs )

05:35.460 --> 05:38.065
Bitch, I said
right now.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.863
( cash register clicks )

05:45.610 --> 05:48.431
I saw your face!

05:48.480 --> 05:49.708
Boy, what
did you do?

06:22.550 --> 06:23.869
Hi, buddy.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.708
- Hi, Pop.
- You did good.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.378
- You did so good.
- I was disciplined.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.481
Yeah?

06:33.520 --> 06:36.455
Me and Kenya
are ready to go.

06:39.530 --> 06:42.567
Yeah, let's go.
Come on.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.522
Ready to go, boy?

06:46.970 --> 06:51.009
* They can't catch me,
'cause I'm too strong... *

06:51.040 --> 06:53.076
Davis?

06:53.110 --> 06:56.773
Micah,
it's time to go.
Let's go!

06:56.810 --> 06:59.108
Micah, you heard
your mother, now.
Don't make her call you twice.

06:59.150 --> 07:01.641
Sorry, Mom,
I was on the phone.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.511
And when are you
not on the phone?

07:03.550 --> 07:04.949
( scoffs )

07:04.990 --> 07:06.958
It's like a member
of the family now,
you know.

07:06.990 --> 07:09.652
- Micah: You have two phones!
- I need two phones.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.123
You should get
his friends
to pay the bill.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.128
- You multitask.
- All right. Bye.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.924
- Have a good game,
Mr. West.
- Thanks, Roclq.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.497
Uh, good game, Dad.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.904
See you tonight,
honey.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.673
You gave him
money.

07:27.710 --> 07:30.770
How does that help
prove my point?

07:30.810 --> 07:32.516
What is the point
again?

07:32.550 --> 07:34.871
That we can't
spoon-feed him
every opportunity.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.583
He needs to work for money.
He's 15, he's gotta learn.

07:38.620 --> 07:40.781
Okay.

07:40.820 --> 07:44.221
Well, he takes after
his mother.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.694
He's the top of his class.
He's_the smartest kid
In the room.

07:46.730 --> 07:47.992
Baby, I think he's
learning just fine.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.794
I mean learning
real life, Davis.

07:50.830 --> 07:53.264
Charley,

07:53.300 --> 07:55.598
this is_
our real lIfe.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.200
- ( sighs )
- Ain't it good?

07:58.240 --> 08:00.276
Hm?

08:00.310 --> 08:02.870
Just let it be good.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.479
Come here.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.256
- Hit 'em where
it hurts, baby.
- Always.

08:18.290 --> 08:22.590
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

08:22.630 --> 08:26.691
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

08:26.740 --> 08:30.039
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

08:30.070 --> 08:32.573
* Keep the colors
in the lines-- take flight *

08:35.010 --> 08:37.672
Dreams never die *

08:42.180 --> 08:46.014
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

08:46.050 --> 08:48.951
* Keep the colors
in the lines-- take flight. *

08:50.190 --> 08:52.897
( saxophone solo
Playing )

08:55.030 --> 08:57.590
* Yeah! Every day...

08:59.840 --> 09:01.728
* I got sunshine...

09:01.770 --> 09:04.705
Yeah, somethin' tell me
you workin' on a pot
of greens down there.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.776
Somethin' tell me
you workin' on
some ribs in there.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.129
- Yeah, I am.
- You are.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.842
- What else you want?
- Cornbread.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.043
- Want some cornbread?
Cornbread.
- Collard greens.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.742
- Mm-hmm. You want
some sweet tea?
- Sweet tea?

09:16.790 --> 09:19.315
- All right, all right.
- You got the sweet tea, girl.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.284
I think_
you gettIn'
a treat. Mm-hmm.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.788
- I want me a treat.
- You want a treat?

09:23.830 --> 09:26.890
( laughing )

09:26.930 --> 09:28.795
Oh-- oh, look
at that baby.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.798
Hey, what up,
Ralph Angel?

09:30.830 --> 09:32.161
What up,
what up?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.191
Knocked out
around Route 13.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.004
Missed most
of the ride.
Here.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.338
Yeah.
Anything?

09:39.370 --> 09:42.271
Said maybe they'll
bring on new men
in fall.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.107
But not now.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.744
I... went and picked up
some money a friend
owed me, though.

09:46.780 --> 09:49.647
- Take that.
- Oh, no, chre. Uh-uh.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.341
- For keepin' Blue and stuff.
- No, chre. Uh-uh.

09:52.390 --> 09:55.086
Give it to your daddy.
He needs it more than I do.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.829
Holleood take
good care of me.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.259
Put it up.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.119
Don't fret that.
I mean, that boy
at home here.

10:05.170 --> 10:08.230
Man, I appreciate that.

10:08.270 --> 10:10.158
When are you
at the rig next?

10:10.210 --> 10:12.405
Time's up
on Tuesday, man.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.136
I'm tryin' to find me
a weekend, but man,
your aunt,

10:15.180 --> 10:17.068
she got me workin'
day a night.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.044
I ain't tryin'
to hear all that, man.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.241
I'm tryin' to tell you, man.
She got my back all
jacked up and everything.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.239
You need to find
you one, though.
Makes life sweeter.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.155
Yeah, well everybody
not like y'all.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.784
Oh, I know that!
I know that.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.421
Singer:
* I think I'm in a maze

10:38.470 --> 10:42.167
* I'm feeling conflicted
within my brain *

10:42.200 --> 10:46.773
* All these contradictions
got me feeling strange *

10:46.810 --> 10:48.732
* Is this a phase?

10:48.780 --> 10:51.078
* Or is this the way?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.948
Rapper:
* I wanna make
nonstop profit *

10:55.980 --> 10:57.686
* I wanna make it
non-profit *

10:57.720 --> 10:59.278
* Close down a store
when I go shoppIn' *

10:59.320 --> 11:01.151
* Open up the floor
for a closed topic *

11:01.190 --> 11:03.181
* A_nd relax on the beach
In remote tropics *

11:03.230 --> 11:05.084
* But grind like I'm broke
and I'm so jobless *

11:05.130 --> 11:06.825
* Feelin' like it's me
against the world *

11:06.860 --> 11:08.191
* It's the other way
around *

11:08.230 --> 11:09.959
* We polluting
and we won't stop it *

11:10.000 --> 11:11.729
* I wanna stay home
and play Xbox *

11:11.770 --> 11:13.795
* But my homies keep on
hittin' up my inbox... *

11:15.870 --> 11:20.034
I mean, there'd be
a camera here right
now filming.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.947
I don't want my life on TV.
I love it how it is.

11:22.980 --> 11:26.177
Well, that's because
your man treats you
like a frickin' queen.

11:26.210 --> 11:29.919
I mean, the pedestal,
crown, the whole nine.

11:29.950 --> 11:34.216
You guys are fancy
and you know it.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.854
And that's exactly
the type of positivity

11:36.890 --> 11:38.858
that people need
to see, Charley.

11:38.890 --> 11:42.223
I mean, we'll bring
the hair-pullin' and
the name-callin'.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.922
And you bring the class
and the romance.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.767
You know, like that
story that you told us,

11:46.800 --> 11:49.803
what was it,
about how you
and Davis met?

11:49.840 --> 11:51.865
At that fraternity
thing, right?

11:51.910 --> 11:55.073
Phi Beta Kappa
isn't a fraternity, girl,
it's an academic cl--

11:55.110 --> 11:57.078
Whatever it is, okay?
It's not the club

11:57.110 --> 11:59.078
- and it's not
outside the arena.
- Right.

11:59.110 --> 12:02.409
The bottom line is,
everyone doesn't have
a Davis West on their arm

12:02.450 --> 12:04.782
with a perfect kid.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.913
Some of us--
real talk--

12:06.960 --> 12:10.828
some of us
have to work just
as hard at this game

12:10.860 --> 12:14.227
as they do
on the court.

12:14.260 --> 12:18.060
( sighs )
We need you
on this, Charley.

12:18.100 --> 12:21.831
They want you.
You know that.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.407
( phones buzzing,
chirping )

12:32.150 --> 12:34.175
Oh, my God.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.514
They say Eddie
is on tape.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.010
And Will, and...

12:42.060 --> 12:43.880
they say Rashid.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.386
Davis isn't here.

12:45.430 --> 12:48.820
Davis isn't here,
but Felix.

12:48.860 --> 12:52.125
Unbelievable.
The whole starting
line, almost.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.229
- What does this mean?
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.932
- We gotta
get outta here.
- ( woman gasps )

12:58.910 --> 13:02.300
( sighing )

13:07.920 --> 13:10.946
Just two dabs,
no more.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.219
Oh, it real bad,
Miss Nova.

13:15.260 --> 13:17.148
You don't expect
I need more?

13:17.190 --> 13:19.249
Two dabs only,
sister.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.019
Faith fills in
the rest.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.221
Hmm.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.966
Merci, Jesus.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.239
Mais non.

13:31.270 --> 13:33.306
I won't take it.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.208
Okay, Miss Blanche,
two dabs.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.914
And a few puffs
on this...

13:45.950 --> 13:48.589
when you have pain.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.524
( chuckles )

13:53.560 --> 13:55.994
Oh, it really helped
the last time.

13:56.030 --> 14:00.194
- ( laughing )
- I know, I know.

14:02.670 --> 14:06.902
Okay, Miss Blanche.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.079
Radio reporter:
Parish alderman Haskins
has said

14:09.110 --> 14:11.203
she wants to explore
other options.

14:11.250 --> 14:15.448
The contract with
?? expires June 30th.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.482
This is New Orleans
radIo news.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.488
Reporter #2:
The New Orleans
city council today

14:19.520 --> 14:21.988
put forth a motion
that would provide...

14:22.020 --> 14:24.022
( radio fades )

14:25.690 --> 14:27.851
* Cold people...

14:31.500 --> 14:34.230
- What up, Nova?
- Wassup, Rid?

14:34.270 --> 14:36.465
Need a half of capers.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.105
No halves.
You know better.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.370
Runnin' low and I got
the hypes ready.

14:41.410 --> 14:43.298
How much you
markin' up these days?

14:43.350 --> 14:45.238
20% at the college.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.009
50% in the
business district.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.109
50%?

14:49.150 --> 14:51.380
I mean, why not?
They got it.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.559
Escalation for risk.

14:53.590 --> 14:56.650
- You'd make a killing
on Wall Street, brother.
- ( chuckles )

14:56.690 --> 15:01.320
- Third flower pot.
- * Cold, cold people...

15:05.670 --> 15:08.969
- * Shock me...
- Take It.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.436
- Come on, Nova.
- They need you
at the rally.

15:12.470 --> 15:14.529
Be in solidarity
with your brothers
and sisters.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.676
You sound like you
tryin' to lead a march
or somethin', Nova.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.076
- I went on the last one.
- Well, there's another one.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.281
And that's why, Rid,
if I don't see you
and your crew there,

15:23.320 --> 15:26.289
I'm cutting y'all off.
And you know I got the best.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.288
You'd want someone
marching for you.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.151
I can't believe I even
have to ask you, brother.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.681
You right.

15:32.730 --> 15:36.257
It just be messin'
with my head sometimes,
you know?

15:36.300 --> 15:38.097
Yeah.

15:38.130 --> 15:40.098
Yeah, I know.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.534
What your fine-ass sister
have to say about that
Gladiator shakedown?

15:48.580 --> 15:51.048
- What you mean?
- Shit, her man's team
and them

15:51.080 --> 15:53.548
been having them
5-on-1 parties
on the road.

15:53.580 --> 15:57.016
You know,
five woes, one ho?

15:57.050 --> 16:01.111
You ain't hear about it?
It's all over the news.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.481
Nah, we ain't
close like that.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.384
Sh-hh,
you ain't
gotta be.

16:05.430 --> 16:07.421
It's all over.

16:07.460 --> 16:11.328
- * Cold, cold people...
- See you.

16:14.370 --> 16:16.634
* Backstabbers

16:19.170 --> 16:21.968
* Cold, cold people...

16:24.350 --> 16:26.648
( whirring )

16:33.690 --> 16:36.158
Yeah, all right.
The ring's gleaming now,

16:36.190 --> 16:39.079
- but it's a wrap
for number five.
- Here it is, right here.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.757
"In the wake of allegations
of a 23-year-old woman,

16:40.800 --> 16:42.756
the members of
the Gladiators
basketball team

16:42.800 --> 16:44.461
- engaged in group sex
with her..."
- You lying!

16:44.500 --> 16:45.762
"on _several occasions
against her wrshes—-"

16:45.800 --> 16:48.098
Hold up, hold up.
Pause, pause.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.062
How it's gonna be
against her wishes
"on several occasions," yo?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.237
- I'm just telling you--
- I'm just telling you,

16:52.270 --> 16:54.170
if it's against
your wishes, ain't gonna
be another occasion.

16:54.210 --> 16:56.371
Come on, man,
these "thots" be
thirsty, I'm saying.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.571
- You right, you right.
- You know I'm right.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.544
That's what
I'm talkin' 'bout.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.548
Okay,
good night,
gentlemen.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.719
Both:
Night, Mr. Ernest.

17:17.830 --> 17:21.732
* I know they're fightin'
about your sugar, mama *

17:21.770 --> 17:25.399
* They're fightin'
all over town *

17:28.440 --> 17:32.570
* I know they're fightin'
about your sugar *

17:32.610 --> 17:36.046
* Fightin' all over town

17:39.790 --> 17:44.386
* You got that granulated
sugary butter *

17:44.430 --> 17:48.628
* The butter
ain't nobody got but you... *

18:02.880 --> 18:06.543
* Now, sugar mama, you
must have got your sugar *

18:06.580 --> 18:09.743
* Way down south
somewhere *

18:13.290 --> 18:17.784
* You must have got
your sugar, sugar mama *

18:17.830 --> 18:20.697
* Way down south
somewhere *

18:24.300 --> 18:26.188
- * Down Lou'siana,
Lou'siana, New Orleans... *
- ( line ringing )

18:26.230 --> 18:27.868
( ringing )

18:30.370 --> 18:31.769
West residence.

18:31.810 --> 18:35.268
This is Ernest Bordelon.
My daughter there?

18:35.310 --> 18:38.768
Mr. Bordelon,
I'll check and see
if she's here.

18:42.780 --> 18:45.340
- Hi, Daddy.
- How's my girl?

18:45.390 --> 18:47.551
I'm here.
I'm okay.

18:47.590 --> 18:49.455
( sighs )
What's this all about?

18:49.490 --> 18:51.629
Oh, I feel so bad
for him, Daddy.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.924
Yeah, well,
it's bad business.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.464
The players who got
caught with the girl
are just kids

18:57.500 --> 18:59.661
comin' straight
outta high school.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.839
No home training,
no life skills.

19:01.870 --> 19:05.931
You hand them millions
of dollars and then
say, "Good luck."

19:05.970 --> 19:08.507
They marry riffraff,
they live wild,

19:08.540 --> 19:11.247
now they're messin' up
our livelihood, you know?

19:11.280 --> 19:13.248
Hmm.
Where's Micah?

19:13.280 --> 19:15.373
He's right here,
he's fine.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.287
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hi, there, son.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.742
Davis is on
a flight back.

19:19.790 --> 19:21.712
It's just a disaster
for the team.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.888
- There goes another
championship.
- Hey. Uh-uh.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.682
Well...

19:26.730 --> 19:30.291
What's the next move, hm?
I know you got a plan.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.321
You always
have a plan.

19:32.370 --> 19:34.235
Well,
the talking points
are that

19:34.270 --> 19:38.229
private lives of players
should remain just that--
private.

19:38.270 --> 19:41.603
And that they are innocent
until this woman proves
otherwise.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.700
Apparently she didn't
go to the police
right away.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.706
The guys are all sayin'

19:46.750 --> 19:49.719
they never
laid eyes on her.
Idiots.

19:49.750 --> 19:53.459
If she has even a shred
of physical evidence,
it's a wrap.

19:53.490 --> 19:56.550
And then Davis will just
have to start again.

19:56.590 --> 19:59.559
Build and break in
a whole new team.

19:59.590 --> 20:02.798
I just, I can't--

20:02.830 --> 20:05.697
Aanay, there's
a press conference

20:05.730 --> 20:07.630
for the owners, coach,
and Davis tomorrow

20:07.670 --> 20:09.467
to properly position
the whole thing.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.468
We still have
a few cards to play.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.434
Well, it seems like,
uh...

20:14.480 --> 20:17.449
sounds like you're
really involved.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.869
I'm helping a little
with strategy.

20:19.910 --> 20:23.311
Just a little, you know.
They asked.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.989
I can understand
them asking.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.853
( phone beeps )

20:30.890 --> 20:33.290
I know, Daddy.

20:33.330 --> 20:35.855
I have plans
to come home soon.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.994
I am going to help you
deal with the farm, I am.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.737
But things are so
up in the air right now.
You understand.

20:41.770 --> 20:45.558
Oh, sure. Ijust called
to make sure y'all okay,
that's all this call's about.

20:45.610 --> 20:48.579
I'm gonna come soon
and I'll fix everything

20:48.610 --> 20:51.602
when I get down there,
okay? I promise.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.345
Can I send you anything
in the meantime?

20:53.380 --> 20:54.847
Oh, no, no, no.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.314
I'm making do
just fine.

20:57.350 --> 21:00.478
You don't have to make do,
Daddy, I can send you
what you need.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.579
No, no,
I just need

21:02.620 --> 21:04.520
a little advice,

21:04.560 --> 21:06.585
that's all,
and time.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.928
I could use
a little time.

21:11.470 --> 21:15.793
I'll come soon
and I will give you
all my time, okay?

21:15.840 --> 21:18.729
Let me just--
let me just deal
with this. Okay?

21:18.770 --> 21:22.001
Of course,
of course. Yes!

21:22.040 --> 21:23.974
Okay, Daddy.

21:24.010 --> 21:26.706
I'll talk to you
in a bit, okay?

21:26.750 --> 21:30.345
- Bye, Charley.
- Bye, Daddy.

21:33.820 --> 21:36.288
( handset clicks )

21:38.090 --> 21:41.719
( beeps )

21:41.760 --> 21:43.990
( children's voices
overlapping )

21:52.670 --> 21:55.673
Everything okay,
Mr. Bordelon?

21:55.710 --> 21:58.099
Chris and Nick.

21:58.150 --> 22:01.870
Chris and Nick
said they might not
come to my birthday.

22:01.920 --> 22:06.641
- Well, why not?
- I don't have a trampoline.

22:06.690 --> 22:10.729
Okay, okay.
It's okay.

22:12.530 --> 22:15.988
Okay. Okay, guys,
I need everybody back
in their seats, please.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.822
Come on.

22:18.870 --> 22:21.395
- And Mr. Bordelon?
- Yes, ma'am?

22:21.440 --> 22:25.706
Thank you so much for your
invitation to your soiree
this weekend.

22:25.740 --> 22:27.776
I'd be more than
happy to attend.

22:27.810 --> 22:30.449
( scattered cheering )

22:30.480 --> 22:33.415
( school bell rings )

22:34.950 --> 22:37.339
- Papa!
- ( chuckling )

22:38.520 --> 22:40.408
- Guess what?
- What, sir?

22:40.460 --> 22:43.111
- Tell me everything.
- Ijust did a test.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.823
You did?
Ah, that doesn't
surprise me.

22:46.860 --> 22:51.126
* ...Strong in my mind
today... *

22:54.940 --> 22:57.807
Ernest:
All right.
What you got there?

22:57.840 --> 22:59.535
I got over two feet
over here.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.709
Okay.
Well, I got here...

23:01.740 --> 23:06.006
* Stands in my way

23:08.750 --> 23:14.052
* It keeps me
from tryin'... *

23:15.590 --> 23:17.478
- Wassup, boy?
- Pop!

23:17.530 --> 23:22.797
- * Who am I to say?
- What's up, big guy? Huh?

23:25.230 --> 23:29.564
Oh, man, you heaw.

23:30.870 --> 23:35.000
Ralph Angel:
What's up, Pop?

23:35.040 --> 23:38.578
Pop, guess what?
Miss Velez is coming
to our house.

23:38.610 --> 23:40.646
- Who's Miss Velez?
- My teacher!

23:40.680 --> 23:43.843
These guys were
being mean about comin'
to the birthday party

23:43.890 --> 23:45.983
but_ then Miss Velez
saId she's coming

23:46.020 --> 23:48.511
so now everybody
wants to come now!

23:48.560 --> 23:52.656
Well, I told you if we
did this, we gotta keep
everything under control.

23:52.690 --> 23:54.897
Pops can't spend
a lot of money.

23:54.930 --> 23:56.750
And who was
mean to you?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.688
The balloons
I saw at the store
with Auntie Nova,

23:58.730 --> 24:00.766
not the fancy ones.

24:00.800 --> 24:04.099
I was meaning
the kind we blow up
ourselves.

24:04.140 --> 24:06.859
Well, sir,
what color balloons
do you want?

24:06.910 --> 24:11.199
Red and purple.
Maybe Mom can
come and help.

24:11.250 --> 24:15.573
What'd I say, Blue?
Now look at me.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.178
What did I say?

24:17.220 --> 24:19.108
Okay.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.951
- I'ma get on.
- Ernest: Yeah. Yeah.

24:23.990 --> 24:25.821
Okay, then.
Thanks for the
measurement.

24:25.860 --> 24:28.090
Ain't nothin'.
You need that.

24:28.130 --> 24:29.791
- It's a good tractor.
- Ernest: Yeah, well,
we'll see about it.

24:29.830 --> 24:33.266
Yeah, big as hell,
but it'll fit.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.234
All right,
Mr. Denton.

24:37.940 --> 24:41.706
Blue, take this on inside.
Get washed up, hear?

24:46.610 --> 24:48.578
Anything?

24:48.620 --> 24:50.918
They said next month,
maybe.

24:50.950 --> 24:54.078
Thanks for picking him up
so I could check on it.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.849
Yeah.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.818
Ahem.

25:00.860 --> 25:02.657
Gettin' that
tractor, Pop?

25:02.700 --> 25:06.158
Well, I'm thinkin' about it.
Gotta keep up appearances.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.874
Some money owed me
came in.

25:13.910 --> 25:16.572
Came in from where?

25:17.810 --> 25:20.278
Craps
a few months back.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.574
I been on my dude
over in the Ninth
to pay up.

25:22.620 --> 25:24.679
Finally did.

25:24.720 --> 25:30.056
Six months out of prison
and you're playing craps
in the Ninth?

25:30.090 --> 25:32.752
- Yup.
- I know it ain't enough
to nothin'--

25:32.790 --> 25:34.758
just a couple hundred

25:34.800 --> 25:37.519
help out around here
a little maybe.

25:39.330 --> 25:43.198
Maybe get that new
tractor part to fix
the old one up.

25:46.070 --> 25:49.005
Fix up the old one.

25:57.820 --> 26:00.345
I don't know why
he still asks for her.

26:00.390 --> 26:03.018
He knows how she is.

26:04.260 --> 26:07.149
Every child
wants their mother.

26:13.670 --> 26:15.661
You talk
to Charley?

26:15.700 --> 26:17.292
No, you?

26:17.340 --> 26:19.262
Yeah.

26:19.310 --> 26:21.198
Yeah,
she fine.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.800
Know she ain't
gonna let It be
nothin' but fine.

26:23.850 --> 26:27.638
Mm.
You got that right.

26:30.380 --> 26:34.259
( keys jingling )

26:34.290 --> 26:37.054
News anchor:
The unidentified woman
says the Incrdent occurred

26:37.090 --> 26:40.127
three weeks ago,
after a game against
the Oaks.

26:40.160 --> 26:43.698
The assault is reported
to involve several
L.A. Gladiators

26:43.730 --> 26:45.368
in a hotel room
registered

26:45.400 --> 26:48.665
to celebrated rookie
point guard Felix Evans.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.134
Co-anchor:
The Gladiators'
front office has launched

26:51.170 --> 26:53.934
an internal investigation
with local authorities

26:53.980 --> 26:55.504
in both Houston
and Los Angeles.

26:55.540 --> 26:59.203
While all players
in question remain active
at the moment,

26:59.250 --> 27:02.276
three-time MVP and
team captain DaVIS West

27:02.320 --> 27:05.187
faces an uphill battle
in his quest for a fifth title

27:05.220 --> 27:08.257
with a team
that's now in shambles.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.417
- All the work, baby.
- I know.

27:10.460 --> 27:13.850
But it's
not over.

27:13.900 --> 27:17.097
It is.

27:17.130 --> 27:22.158
And I got, what,
maybe three more
good years?

27:22.200 --> 27:25.328
I need a great team
behind me, sweetheart.

27:25.370 --> 27:28.669
I don't wanna have to
build this thing
from scratch.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.132
Not again.

27:30.180 --> 27:33.672
They'll gut
their contracts
and bring in new guys.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.870
Good guys.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.809
You'll be back
next season.

27:38.850 --> 27:40.784
Oh, I don't know.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.983
You're not ready
to retire, Davis.

27:47.030 --> 27:51.922
No--_ no.
No, it's--

27:51.970 --> 27:54.029
( sighs )

27:57.810 --> 28:01.906
I may be ready
to move, though.

28:01.940 --> 28:05.239
I don't know,
Oakland or Portland.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.840
I mean, we're close enough
to strong teams, baby.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.144
And that's what I need
to get five. That's what
it's gonna take to get five.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.740
I gotta have five.

28:13.820 --> 28:16.789
You know the plan.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.754
I know.

28:20.530 --> 28:22.794
Maybe--

28:22.830 --> 28:26.368
Maybe Atlanta,
or Charlotte.

28:28.270 --> 28:32.866
It would be nice
to spend some time
with your family.

28:32.910 --> 28:36.778
Get a place in the South
for two or three years,
right?

28:45.020 --> 28:48.319
( sighs )

28:48.360 --> 28:50.828
Whatever we need
to do, baby.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.195
Hey.

29:06.440 --> 29:12.174
* I'm so lost traveling down
an old dirt road *

29:13.950 --> 29:18.410
* I'm lost flying through
a blood-orange slq *

29:21.520 --> 29:26.423
* I'm lost swimmin'
amongst the coral
so far down *

29:29.260 --> 29:33.128
_ * I'm lost
in an empty room *

29:33.170 --> 29:37.800
* Without even a sound

29:37.840 --> 29:42.402
* I'ma dig myself
to an open grave... *

29:46.180 --> 29:49.217
( wind rustling )

29:49.250 --> 29:53.209
( music playing )

29:57.930 --> 30:00.819
Hi.

30:00.860 --> 30:03.124
Miss Velez:
Hey, everyone!

30:03.160 --> 30:07.119
- Kids: Hi!
- Hi, Miss Velez!

30:07.170 --> 30:08.967
How you doin'?

30:13.440 --> 30:15.078
Hollywood:
We ain't doin' it
at the same level.

30:15.110 --> 30:17.305
They into
somethin' else, now.

30:17.340 --> 30:19.570
Seems like
they havin'
a good time.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.044
Mm-hmm.
Hey, baby.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.479
You the queen
of partying.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.545
Can't you help me
get this turned up
a little?

30:25.590 --> 30:27.285
Baby, they five.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.481
Ain't not turning up
I know appropriate
for five.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.421
Just feed 'em.
Kids play, they'll
loosen up.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.155
Got some hot dogs
in there, I'm makin'
some ribs,

30:34.200 --> 30:37.192
and while you're at it,
get me another brew.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.407
Let me see.
Is that your card?

30:44.440 --> 30:48.206
Uh-huh.
How did you do that?

30:48.240 --> 30:51.846
- Miss Velez!
- Hi!

31:02.590 --> 31:04.387
Oh--!

31:08.030 --> 31:10.225
I don't believe
we've met.

31:10.260 --> 31:12.899
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:12.930 --> 31:15.398
Ralph Angel Bordelon.
Hi.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.034
My Aunt Violet
usually picks Blue up.

31:18.070 --> 31:20.209
Blue's my boy.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.674
I'm his dad.

31:22.710 --> 31:24.109
No apology needed.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.345
Is it Ralph or Angel?

31:26.380 --> 31:28.644
It's Ralph Angel.
All together.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.989
Well, can I help
with anything,
Ralph Angel?

31:31.020 --> 31:34.217
- I brought a few things.
- Wow.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.216
See, I'm not
good at this.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.455
We're gonna be
just fine.

31:38.490 --> 31:42.324
- ( lighter clicks )
- Kid: Do you know
what flavor it is?

31:45.270 --> 31:46.498
( chuckles )

31:46.530 --> 31:52.162
All:
* Happy birthday to you

31:52.210 --> 31:57.000
* Happy birthday to you

31:57.040 --> 32:03.946
- * Happy birthday,
dear Blue... *
- ( whispers )

32:03.990 --> 32:08.552
* Happy birthday to you.

32:08.590 --> 32:10.649
( whispers )
Make a wish and
blow out the candle.

32:10.690 --> 32:13.557
Kid:
Make a wish.

32:13.590 --> 32:15.455
- Kid: Yay!
- Kid #2: Yay, Blue!

32:15.500 --> 32:17.354
Yay, Blue!
You crazy, man!

32:17.400 --> 32:20.460
( cheering, clapping )

32:22.070 --> 32:23.628
Happy birthday.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.405
Adult:
Happy birthday, Blue.

32:26.440 --> 32:30.479
Kid:
Happy birthday, Blue.

32:30.510 --> 32:32.649
I have something
that my dad's worker
brought.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.217
You're supposed to hit it
and candy calls out,
he said.

32:35.250 --> 32:38.014
- It's a piata.
- A piata? Okay.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.027
Bye.

32:48.330 --> 32:51.629
Are you awake?

32:52.800 --> 32:54.734
Can you
hear me?

32:54.770 --> 32:56.397
- All right, we're
gonna be just fine.
- Girl: Somebody, help!

32:56.440 --> 32:59.500
_ - Hel I
Ralph Angeli): Pop ?

32:59.540 --> 33:02.202
She was the nationally
recognized scholar

33:02.240 --> 33:04.447
who bypassed
the trappings of fame

33:04.480 --> 33:07.040
to continue to pursue
her education.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.742
Their marriage
at a young age
was a fairy tale.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.283
America
fell in love with
the West family.

33:12.320 --> 33:16.416
We all remember when Davis
supported Charley through
business school,

33:16.460 --> 33:18.655
bringing their
adorable son, Micah.

33:18.690 --> 33:21.659
And now Charley supports
Davis as his manager,

33:21.700 --> 33:25.090
putting her MBA to savvy use
for "The Gentleman."

33:25.130 --> 33:28.167
Together they built
a family and a fortune.

33:28.200 --> 33:32.102
Although Davis West
has not been accused
of anything,

33:32.140 --> 33:34.472
as team captain,
he's standing by
his teammates

33:34.510 --> 33:36.432
who've been accused
of rape.

33:36.480 --> 33:39.449
I wanna say...

33:39.480 --> 33:42.244
I stand by my teammates.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.714
I stand by these men.

33:44.750 --> 33:47.344
Private lives
should be just that--

33:47.390 --> 33:48.789
private.

33:48.820 --> 33:51.482
And then,
Charley Bordelon-West

33:51.530 --> 33:53.179
handled herself
with class

33:53.230 --> 33:56.119
after being confronted
by a reporter.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.628
Charley!
Charley Bordelon-West!

33:58.670 --> 34:01.195
Are you okay with supporting
alleged rapists?

34:01.240 --> 34:04.732
Every family represented here
believes in this team,

34:04.770 --> 34:06.658
and in each other,

34:06.710 --> 34:09.133
and we will
stand by together

34:09.180 --> 34:11.603
while this investigation
is underway.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.504
_ News anchor:
Tonight's press conference,

34:13.550 --> 34:15.643
defending the integrity
of his teammates,

34:15.680 --> 34:18.410
was a reminder
that class and grace

34:18.450 --> 34:20.589
still exist in this game,
my friends,

34:20.620 --> 34:22.588
and that
if you work
hard enough,

34:22.620 --> 34:25.282
the good guys
can finish first.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.582
( cheering within )

34:27.630 --> 34:30.394
Oh, shoot!
They ain't ready.

34:30.430 --> 34:32.295
Man, you know they
ain't ever ready.

34:32.330 --> 34:33.820
So, what do you
want tonight?

34:33.870 --> 34:35.690
I'm gonna need
a minimum 40 points.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.696
Come on, Micah.
You _know that's
a given, man.

34:37.740 --> 34:40.300
Okay! Confident tonight,
are we?

34:40.340 --> 34:42.331
- You know it! Hey, baby.
- Hey.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.836
Any requests?

34:43.880 --> 34:45.745
Well, I'd like
an overage
of assists,

34:45.780 --> 34:47.645
so we can drive home
the whole

34:47.680 --> 34:50.114
"supporting your
teammates" narrative.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.243
Mm. Done.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.617
* Fighting over rings,
wanna be the king *

34:57.660 --> 34:59.548
* Long live the chief

34:59.590 --> 35:03.196
* Yeah, watch, pretty mama,
while I slang my cane *

35:03.230 --> 35:05.721
- * Long live the chief...

35:05.770 --> 35:08.830
- * Cockroaches

- One. Gino, one.

35:08.870 --> 35:10.690
* _Hand-me-downs
With the patches *

35:10.740 --> 35:13.208
* Mama put a little money
in the mattress *

35:13.240 --> 35:16.277
* Taught me how
to make a silver spoon
outta plastic *

35:16.310 --> 35:17.800
Come on!
Come on, come on!

35:19.810 --> 35:21.744
Go, Davis!

35:21.780 --> 35:24.317
* Now they say,
"Jidenna, why you dressin'
so classic?" *

35:24.350 --> 35:27.183
* I don't want
my best-dressed day
in a casket *

35:27.220 --> 35:29.916
* You can either lead,
follow, or get out
the way... *

35:29.960 --> 35:33.282
- Yeah!
- Go, Davis!

35:33.330 --> 35:36.219
* Got a hundred-year plan,
you just think
about today *

35:36.260 --> 35:38.797
* Always been about time
more than been about pay *

35:38.830 --> 35:43.460
* Can't rump with me,
Usain couldn't run
With me... *

35:43.500 --> 35:45.900
Pop? Pop,
can you hear me?

35:45.940 --> 35:47.567
Pop,
it's gonna be all right,
I promise.

35:47.610 --> 35:49.805
Violet:
I don't know what happened.

35:49.840 --> 35:52.900
- I want to go!
- You hear me? You hear me?
We comin'.

35:52.950 --> 35:56.772

with him. Easy.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.789
- Violet: I'm comin'.
He's gonna be fine.
- Come on, Vi.

35:59.820 --> 36:02.948
Blue:
I wanna go with Papa,
Daddy!

36:02.990 --> 36:05.686
( crowd cheering )

36:08.430 --> 36:09.829
Watch your man.
Movement.

36:11.830 --> 36:15.561

buzzing, chirping )

_ Woman: _
DaVIs, you're a rapist!

It's not a lie, man.
Look!

Woman:
He is a rapist!

( booing continues )

37:12.030 --> 37:14.555
_ Man: _
Rapist! Rapist!

37:14.600 --> 37:17.751

- No!

37:17.800 --> 37:20.360
- I want to go...
- You can't, Blue.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.992
You can't Blue,
you can't!

37:22.040 --> 37:25.567
It's gonna be okay.
Stay here with Miss Velez.
I'll be back.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.464
Daddy, I want to go!

37:27.510 --> 37:29.569

What the hell
are you doin'?

37:58.340 --> 38:00.501
- What did you do?
- Wha--?

38:00.540 --> 38:03.077
What are you
talkin' about?

38:03.110 --> 38:05.044
What...

38:05.080 --> 38:07.640
did you... do?

38:07.680 --> 38:09.875
Davis:
What are you
talking about?

38:09.920 --> 38:11.842
( screams )
What did you do?!

38:11.890 --> 38:14.017

38:20.360 --> 38:23.454
You liar_!
You're a liar!

38:23.500 --> 38:26.992
What did you do?
You're a liar, Davis!

38:39.450 --> 38:42.544
Where did Nova
learn her ways?

38:42.580 --> 38:44.980
Her mother
knew all about it.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.817
It's real.

38:46.850 --> 38:48.784
I don't doubt it.

39:22.490 --> 39:25.459
Ralph Angel?

39:25.490 --> 39:26.787
Darla, where are you?

39:26.830 --> 39:29.719
- Nasty!
- You right!

39:29.760 --> 39:32.467
- Darla, where are you?
- Ralph Angel!

39:56.220 --> 39:57.915
Woman:
Hello?

39:57.960 --> 39:59.951
Miss Velez, hi.
Is, uh, is Blue okay?

39:59.990 --> 40:02.993
He's sound asleep.
How's your father?

40:03.030 --> 40:06.158
He's got surgery
in a few hours
after some tests.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.567
- It's a stroke.
- Oh, my God.

40:09.600 --> 40:14.060
I'm sorry.
I'm just so sorry
that this is happening.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.908
I'm sure he's going
to pull through.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.840
He's got a strong
way about him.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.849
Yeah.
Yeah, he does.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.041
Listen, um...

40:24.080 --> 40:28.187
I don't have anyone
to watch Blue right now.
We all here--

40:28.220 --> 40:30.916
Don't worry,
I'll take him to school
with me this morning.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.019
( sighs )
I really appreciate it.

40:33.060 --> 40:36.120
I'll be there
right after school.
Right when the bell rings.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.196
Okay, but if you
aren't there,

40:38.230 --> 40:41.119
I'll take him home with me.
I'll text you the address.

40:41.170 --> 40:43.866
Thank you.
I-- I don't even
know what to say.

40:43.900 --> 40:47.836
This-- this is
real good of you.

40:53.550 --> 40:55.438
Come here.

- Hey, Auntie Vi.
- Hi, baby.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.093
Why aren't you all
answerin' your phone?

41:17.140 --> 41:21.736
Uh, some... things
happened here today.
It's real bad.

41:21.780 --> 41:24.101
I know. I heard.
I'm sorry.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.108
It's unthinkable.
I don't even know
what to say.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.845
We're gonna talk it all
through.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.041
I wanna hear
everything,

41:30.080 --> 41:33.208
but I need you
_to listen to me
right now, okay?

41:33.250 --> 41:36.151
- Okay.
- I need you
to take charge

41:36.190 --> 41:39.159
and get your mama here
by tomorrow.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.189
Hey, Mom?

42:24.840 --> 42:27.035
Hey, Mom...?

42:33.010 --> 42:35.911
- Ma?
- Leave me alone.

42:38.950 --> 42:40.918
The doctor
will be in soon, okay?

42:40.950 --> 42:43.009
- Violet: Thank you.
- All right.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.994
( monitor beeping )

43:00.740 --> 43:02.731
( whimpers )

43:05.350 --> 43:06.999
( whimpers )

43:20.330 --> 43:22.821
( groans )

43:22.860 --> 43:25.624
( paper rustling )

43:36.780 --> 43:38.748
( Ernest groans )

43:56.460 --> 43:59.395
He fine, Pop.
He good.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.230
I think he wants
to know where Blue is.

44:06.270 --> 44:08.158
( grunts )

44:10.210 --> 44:13.748
His teacher took him home
from school to her house.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.815
Well, she real nice.

44:27.030 --> 44:29.828
Look, I'ma--
I'ma see y'all later.

44:34.970 --> 44:37.097
( sighs )

44:38.040 --> 44:40.258
Ralph.
Ralph.

44:40.310 --> 44:42.904
Bring him here.
I'll watch him.

44:42.940 --> 44:44.339
No, I don't
want him here.

44:44.380 --> 44:46.200
But Daddy
wants to see him.

44:46.250 --> 44:49.913
Yeah, but I don't
want Blue to see him
like this.

44:49.950 --> 44:54.011
- Tubes and stuff
will scare him.
- He'll be okay.

44:54.050 --> 44:56.382
I just think
it'll help.

44:56.420 --> 44:58.854
Thanks, but...

44:58.890 --> 45:00.824
I'll see you later.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.468
TV news anchor:
And now, we have
this breaking news.

45:05.500 --> 45:09.038
The Gladiators'
troubles continue with a new
surveillance Video

45:09.070 --> 45:10.799
That has gone viral.

45:10.840 --> 45:13.809
If you haven't seen
the footage yet, here it is.

45:13.840 --> 45:17.037
Superstar Davis West,
who was not initially named

45:17.080 --> 45:19.071
in the Gladiators'
sex scandal,

45:19.110 --> 45:21.078
and immediately claimed
he wasn't involved,

45:21.110 --> 45:23.340
is seen
here with the rest
of his teammates

45:23.380 --> 45:26.349
throwing the young woman
over his shoulder,

45:26.390 --> 45:30.349
groping her,
and carrying her into
their Houston hotel room.

45:30.390 --> 45:32.950
And then we have
this incredible scene
from last night's game

45:32.990 --> 45:35.788
at the Sherik Center
in Los Angeles.
Take a look.

45:35.830 --> 45:38.492
After Davis's
well-known wife,
Charley Bordelon-West

45:38.530 --> 45:40.896
saw the footage,
she stormed onto the court

45:40.930 --> 45:43.990
and confronted Davis
in the middle of the game.

45:44.040 --> 45:45.359
You can clearly
hear her yelling,

45:45.410 --> 45:47.366
"What did you do, Davis?"
multiple times.

45:47.410 --> 45:50.868
- And he was shocked.
- ( Charley screaming )

45:59.850 --> 46:02.910
Woman:
Ralph Angel?

46:02.960 --> 46:04.928
I need to talk
to you.

46:07.930 --> 46:09.898
You out your mind?

46:09.930 --> 46:13.161
You won't
call me back.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.339
Have you actually
lost it?

46:17.040 --> 46:22.103
I need to talk to you
and you won't
call me back.

46:22.140 --> 46:24.904
What am I
supposed to do?

46:26.410 --> 46:29.413
You have the right
to be that way to me.

46:29.450 --> 46:31.441
You do.

46:31.480 --> 46:36.452
- But, please?
- My father's in there.

46:36.490 --> 46:38.048
He can't talk,

46:38.090 --> 46:40.786
can't move right.

46:42.200 --> 46:45.294
You wanna talk
about you?

46:45.330 --> 46:47.389
No.

46:47.430 --> 46:49.159
I wanna talk
about Blue.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.862
There ain't no
talkin' about Blue.

46:51.910 --> 46:55.175
I took a test
for a job--

46:55.210 --> 46:57.007
a better job.

46:57.040 --> 46:58.507
The city is hiring.

46:58.540 --> 47:02.374
Oh, the city's
hiring addicts now?

47:02.420 --> 47:05.446
There's a program,
and...

47:05.490 --> 47:08.015
if you finish it,
you can apply for
some city jobs.

47:08.050 --> 47:11.053
Why do I care, huh?

47:11.090 --> 47:13.479
I did good.

47:13.530 --> 47:16.988
I applied for this
good job at City Hall.

47:17.030 --> 47:19.066
It's_ in the new
parking structure,

47:19.100 --> 47:22.331
taking money
and giving tickets.

47:22.370 --> 47:24.861
The booth is before
you drive in, so...

47:24.910 --> 47:26.969
I'd get to work
outside.

47:27.010 --> 47:29.934
It's $15.75 an hour.

47:29.980 --> 47:33.199
Full time,
with city benefits.

47:34.380 --> 47:37.474
I don't care
what you do.

47:41.150 --> 47:43.482
You called me today.
I thought--

47:43.520 --> 47:45.329
You thought wrong.

47:45.360 --> 47:47.419
Whatever the hell
you thought,

47:47.460 --> 47:49.325
you thought wrong,
okay?

47:49.360 --> 47:51.555
_ _I can start
giVing you money
for him.

47:51.600 --> 47:54.125
Maybe I can
start seeing him?

47:54.170 --> 47:57.264
Supervised--
You could be there.

47:57.300 --> 48:00.030
Or somebody else.

48:00.070 --> 48:03.335
Oh, I could
be there?

48:03.380 --> 48:05.439
- I could be there, huh?
- I just meant--

48:05.480 --> 48:08.347
You think I'm weak
right now and you
can take advantage.

48:08.380 --> 48:12.316
- ( sneers )
- I don't think that.

48:13.250 --> 48:15.309
I wanna see him.

48:17.390 --> 48:19.654
I have a right!

48:22.400 --> 48:25.665
YouTe
forgetting things.

48:25.700 --> 48:28.123
All I can do
is make amends
and move forward.

48:28.170 --> 48:30.968
Now, I'm not gonna
let you come back in

48:31.000 --> 48:33.662
and leave him again.

48:33.710 --> 48:37.077
You see,
I didn't have a
choice back then.

48:37.110 --> 48:39.442
But I do now.

48:39.480 --> 48:42.677
You know what I see
when I look at you?

48:42.720 --> 48:46.281
- Stop.
- You know the image
in my head, right?

48:46.320 --> 48:50.484
I think my life is bad...

48:50.520 --> 48:53.284
then I think about yours.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.498
( mutters )
Get your ass on.

49:00.300 --> 49:01.369
( truck door slams )

49:04.240 --> 49:08.700
I gotta go get
this money, man.

49:08.740 --> 49:11.504
I just gotta keep
everything afloat.

49:11.540 --> 49:14.179
Or else I'd be
right here with you.

49:14.210 --> 49:16.314
You know that, right?

49:21.250 --> 49:23.957
I'll be right back,
okay?

49:31.130 --> 49:34.065
- I'm sorry, Vi.
- It's okay.

49:35.470 --> 49:37.461
This is gonna
be okay.

49:37.500 --> 49:41.231
I left a week's worth
of tips in the ice box
for you.

49:41.270 --> 49:44.068
- Hollywood--
- Listen, I don't
want you thinkin'

49:44.110 --> 49:46.203
about no work,
no shifts.

49:46.250 --> 49:47.547
None of that stuff,
all right?

49:47.580 --> 49:50.743
Just concentrate on him.
You heard me?

49:55.790 --> 49:58.679
Oh, Violet, Hollywood.
How's he doing?

49:58.720 --> 50:00.256
He's, uh--

50:00.290 --> 50:02.451
It's touch and go.
Good moments and bad.

50:02.500 --> 50:06.766
Doctor got him
on medication right now.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.563
Understood.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.091
I just wanted
to make show my face
and tell ya

50:11.140 --> 50:13.506
that if you need
anything at all,
you holler, you hear?

50:13.540 --> 50:16.179
Uh...

50:16.210 --> 50:18.678
it actually
would be a big help

50:18.710 --> 50:21.508
if y'all could
look after the farm...

50:21.550 --> 50:22.619
Yeah.

50:22.650 --> 50:25.187
while the family's here
for the next little while.

50:25.220 --> 50:27.085
If you could.

50:27.120 --> 50:31.409
Uh, Vi, you know
he don't have no crop
this season, right?

50:33.830 --> 50:35.695
What do you mean?

50:35.730 --> 50:39.029
Well, he hasn't
planted proper in
the last two years.

50:41.700 --> 50:43.691
Why not?

50:43.740 --> 50:47.403
Well, crops
have been paltry
for the last few cycles

50:47.440 --> 50:49.806
and prices
are dropping
across the board.

50:49.840 --> 50:52.673
I mean, he started
last season but he
couldn't bring it in,

50:52.710 --> 50:55.417
and this season,
the finances just
didn't add up right,

50:55.450 --> 50:57.418
so he couldn't plant.

50:57.450 --> 51:00.089
Well,
what's he been doing

51:00.120 --> 51:01.678
out there
every day, then?

51:01.720 --> 51:04.154
He--

51:05.330 --> 51:07.525
Come on.

51:10.460 --> 51:12.291
He took a job
somewhere.

51:12.330 --> 51:16.437
Now, he--
he wouldn't say where.

51:16.470 --> 51:19.303
I know it's not
on a farm.

51:19.340 --> 51:22.309
I checked around,
so, I don't know.

51:22.340 --> 51:24.308
But I do know
it wasn't easy

51:24.340 --> 51:26.843
and he didn't
do any of it lightly.

51:34.290 --> 51:36.417
Listen, you know,
he's always workin'
on a plan

51:36.460 --> 51:38.416
to get this place
up and runnin' again.

51:38.460 --> 51:41.554
And he will.

52:01.880 --> 52:03.677
( knocking on door)

52:06.550 --> 52:09.417
To what do I owe
this visit...

52:09.460 --> 52:11.553
Detective?

52:13.230 --> 52:14.720
Brew tea tonight?

52:22.400 --> 52:24.834
Why didn't you
call, Nova?

52:25.970 --> 52:28.564
It's your father.

52:28.610 --> 52:31.238
You coulda
called.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.913
I can't.

52:40.990 --> 52:43.515
And I don't want to.

52:43.560 --> 52:46.620
That's my choice.

52:46.660 --> 52:49.720
Please respect it.

52:49.760 --> 52:53.161
How many years
have I been
respectin' it?

53:18.460 --> 53:21.827
He's gonna be sleepin'.
We don't_ wanna
wake him up.

53:21.860 --> 53:24.556
He has a machine
next to him

53:24.600 --> 53:26.966
helps him
breathe good.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.790
_ Puts the air
right in his nose
with a special tube.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.263
We have to be
very quiet, okay?

53:34.310 --> 53:36.801
Or the doctors
will kick us out.
You don't want that, right?

53:36.840 --> 53:39.274
- ( whispering )
Okay, Pop.
- Okay.

53:47.620 --> 53:51.556
( monitor beeping )

53:51.590 --> 53:55.993
* Somebody wishing
on a shooting star *

53:57.930 --> 54:02.026
* A shooting star
streaming across the slq *

54:02.070 --> 54:05.665
* You know it's just
a meteorite *

54:07.810 --> 54:12.349
* People throwing pennies
in a wishing well *

54:14.710 --> 54:18.714
* Wishing well's
gonna run dry... *

54:18.750 --> 54:22.311
( whispers )
Papa, it's Blue.

54:24.760 --> 54:29.629
* Everybody talking 'bout
changing the world *

54:31.100 --> 54:35.366
* World ain't ever
gonna change *

54:35.400 --> 54:41.339
* But you can always
change it for me *

54:41.370 --> 54:47.639
* I'll shuck all the oysters
and you keep the pearls *

54:47.680 --> 54:52.640
* I do my shucking
and my jiving for free *

54:52.690 --> 54:55.955
* Free

54:55.990 --> 55:00.529
* Like walking down
the beach at night *

55:00.560 --> 55:06.396
* Throw a bunch of lines out
to the one you want *

55:06.430 --> 55:10.662
* Till you get it right

55:12.440 --> 55:16.479
* Sometimes you don't

55:16.510 --> 55:20.071
* Get it right

55:24.580 --> 55:28.482
* Sometimes you won't

55:32.690 --> 55:37.423
* Get it right

55:41.400 --> 55:44.733
* When you do

55:48.510 --> 55:52.332
* It's out of sight...

55:53.610 --> 55:57.478
( Ernest sighs, gasps )

55:57.520 --> 56:01.012
* Sometimes you do

56:05.460 --> 56:08.349
* Get it right.

56:23.780 --> 56:26.078
( murmuring )

56:28.880 --> 56:32.145
Photographers:
Charley! Charley!

56:32.180 --> 56:34.887
( man thumping )
Charley! You still
havin' sex with Davis?

56:34.920 --> 56:37.957
- * Take my hand...
- Woman: How about
your dad now, Micah?

56:37.990 --> 56:41.050
- (yelling increases )
- Man: Did you do a pre-nup?

56:41.090 --> 56:45.026
Man:
Charley, did you ever go
to any of those sex parties?

56:45.060 --> 56:46.823
Did you get
some of that too?

56:46.870 --> 56:49.634
( motorcycle buzzes )

56:49.670 --> 56:52.969
* All to be
with you tonight *

56:53.010 --> 56:58.073
* And for the time
that Will come *

56:59.680 --> 57:01.648
No,no,no!

57:01.680 --> 57:06.049
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

57:06.090 --> 57:08.809
( sobbing )

57:16.830 --> 57:19.890
( wails, sobs )

57:31.640 --> 57:33.972
( gasping sobs )

57:42.620 --> 57:45.521
* Take my hand

57:45.560 --> 57:49.121
* You _know I'll be there
if you can *

57:49.160 --> 57:54.689
* I'll cross the sky
for your love *

57:54.730 --> 57:57.699
* And I understand

57:57.740 --> 57:59.605
* These winds and tides

57:59.640 --> 58:01.608
* This change of times

58:01.640 --> 58:06.839
* Won't drag you away

58:06.880 --> 58:08.939
* Hold on

58:08.980 --> 58:12.939
* And hold on tightly

58:12.990 --> 58:15.959
* Hold on

58:15.990 --> 58:23.021
* And don't let go
of my love *

58:23.060 --> 58:25.722
- * The storms will pass...
- * The storm will pass

58:25.770 --> 58:30.537
- * It won't be long...
- * It won't be long now

58:30.570 --> 58:32.162
* His love will last

58:32.200 --> 58:37.069
_ * His love
Will last forever *

58:46.590 --> 58:49.115
* Take my hand

58:49.150 --> 58:52.756
* You _know I'll be there
if you can *

58:52.790 --> 58:57.295
* I'll cross the sky
for your love *

58:57.330 --> 59:02.290
* Give you
What I hold dear *

59:03.700 --> 59:05.759
* Hold on

59:05.810 --> 59:08.267
* And hold on tightly

59:08.310 --> 59:09.902
* Hold on

59:09.940 --> 59:13.046
* Hold on tightly
to this love *

59:13.080 --> 59:16.618
_ * This love
Will last forever... *

59:16.650 --> 59:19.118
I'm sorry, Daddy.

59:20.720 --> 59:23.018
I'll fix it.

59:24.720 --> 59:27.655
