29:58.547 --> 30:01.191
- (BOOING)
- (LAUGHING)

30:05.304 --> 30:07.823
Your friend had a hard night.

30:08.515 --> 30:12.194
Sweet whore, sour beer.

30:14.646 --> 30:18.607
You know, I'm not holding you to
this. No one's forcing you to come.

30:18.608 --> 30:22.663
When I owe a man, I pay him.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.951
MAN: How many this
week, Mr. Pierrepoint?

30:28.952 --> 30:32.413
Six men, two women and a dog.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.874
Varlets and flunkeys,
every one of 'em.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.725
And let me tell you,
the dog was a bitch.

30:40.005 --> 30:43.559
Ever take the head of someone
who was fighting back?

30:47.095 --> 30:50.399
Let me finish up here,
and I'll show you.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.159
What has your man done?

30:54.561 --> 30:56.238
Man?

30:57.064 --> 30:59.273
This here's Mary, my friend.

30:59.274 --> 31:03.486
Slit the throats of 12 men and
cut out the tongues of three.

31:03.487 --> 31:07.087
This one you don't
mess with, brother.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.919
How much?

31:14.623 --> 31:17.875
- She ain't for sale.
- Everyone has a price.

31:17.876 --> 31:21.712
Not this one. Her
head is gold to me.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.516
We have what we need.
There's nothing for us here.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.739
I'll give you two guineas.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.574
Here.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.607
- Four and she's yours.
- (CROWD GROANING)

31:41.608 --> 31:43.150
Show him some mercy.

31:43.151 --> 31:47.001
Let a man trade for
a wretched soul.

32:07.217 --> 32:09.969
I miscounted. It's five.

32:09.970 --> 32:13.180
- You said four.
- That was for her head.

32:13.181 --> 32:18.477
You want what's below it, that's
five guineas down to her toes.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.021
- You're in a murderous business, sir.
- (CHUCKLES)

32:21.022 --> 32:25.025
And what business are you three
in wanting my friend here?

32:25.026 --> 32:28.320
- We're hiring men to protect my home.
- Hmm.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.545
I see. Very nice.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.040
Pierrepoint!

32:40.041 --> 32:43.345
That's the last time I catch
you selling prisoners!

32:50.927 --> 32:54.221
- Five guineas. It's two for the price of one.
- (SCREAMING)

32:54.222 --> 32:56.616
I'm coming as well.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.895
I think he's even better
when you're fighting back.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.698
We don't want trouble with the law.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.830
I think we've already got that.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.830
And ourselves another two men.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.573
Then it's a deal.

33:12.574 --> 33:15.576
Four men and one woman.

33:15.577 --> 33:16.911
Three men,

33:16.912 --> 33:20.807
one woman and a son
of a filthy whore.

33:48.026 --> 33:51.737
So now that I'm a bought
woman, do I call you master?

33:51.738 --> 33:53.614
My name's Hubert.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.824
(CHUCKLES)

33:55.825 --> 33:57.618
Master Hubert.

33:57.619 --> 34:00.798
(LAUGHS)

34:02.624 --> 34:06.502
Your friend seems quite loyal.
Was he also at Rochester?

34:06.503 --> 34:08.920
His name is Berenger.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.672
Saved his life in a skirmish once,

34:10.674 --> 34:13.601
he's had the strange notion
that he owes me ever since.

34:14.219 --> 34:17.304
You didn't ask about Mother.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.473
I trust my aunt is well.

34:19.474 --> 34:22.016
As well as could be expected.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.143
And what of Cousin Blanche?

34:24.145 --> 34:27.188
She's still the same spoiled
princess she always was?

34:27.190 --> 34:28.107
(CHUCKLES)

34:28.108 --> 34:32.319
Worse since she returned from
schooling in France without a prince.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.321
She's eager to hear
about the rebellion.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.592
How you fought against
the king at Rochester.

34:50.045 --> 34:52.313
<i>MAN: Let's go. Hyah!</i>

35:13.236 --> 35:16.005
(SHOUTING)

35:19.367 --> 35:22.295
They're coming, boys!
Hurry to position!

35:23.371 --> 35:26.373
Here they come! Get those
rocks down here now!

35:26.374 --> 35:29.223
(SHOUTING CONTINUES)

35:33.715 --> 35:36.393
SMITH: Come on! Move it!

35:44.392 --> 35:46.060
All right, where are those rocks?

35:46.061 --> 35:47.770
(MAN SHOUTING)

35:47.771 --> 35:49.855
Whatever you've got,
I want 'em here now!

35:49.856 --> 35:51.999
(SHOUTING CONTINUES)

36:03.745 --> 36:05.954
HUBERT: They didn't waste any time.

36:05.955 --> 36:07.456
However we approach we'll be seen.

36:07.457 --> 36:10.501
- Is there a sally port?
- Yes. At the far side of the castle.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.086
GUY: Then that's our way in.

36:12.087 --> 36:15.015
- They'll get there before we do.
- Well, we came for a fight.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.217
Do your serfs have a keen eye?

36:18.218 --> 36:21.988
- Keen enough.
- Then let's go, brother.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.832
Kill them all!

36:46.329 --> 36:49.052
There are too many of them!

36:59.718 --> 37:02.020
You men, hold that section!

37:15.483 --> 37:18.582
(SHOUTING IN DISTANCE CONTINUES)

37:35.336 --> 37:36.888
Go!

37:52.020 --> 37:54.197
HUBERT: It's just on the far side!

38:05.617 --> 38:08.368
Ogre.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.262
(GRUNTS)

38:11.080 --> 38:12.456
HUBERT: Open the door!

38:12.457 --> 38:14.041
MAN: It's Master Hubert!

38:14.042 --> 38:16.185
Open the sally port!

38:18.254 --> 38:19.713
Trouble!

38:19.714 --> 38:21.687
Open the door!

38:23.885 --> 38:27.564
Open the gate! Open the sally port!

38:32.519 --> 38:35.572
- (KNOCKING)
- Open the door!

38:37.398 --> 38:38.899
Get it open!

38:38.900 --> 38:40.734
It's Master Hubert!

38:40.735 --> 38:42.708
(SHOUTING CONTINUES)

38:49.744 --> 38:52.513
- HUBERT: Hurry!
- Come on. Come on.

38:58.211 --> 39:00.388
Open the door!

39:04.759 --> 39:06.677
HUBERT: It's open!

39:06.678 --> 39:08.525
You're still mine.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.906
Get in!

39:16.729 --> 39:18.372
HUBERT: Come on!

39:31.119 --> 39:33.137
Executioner, come on!

39:35.164 --> 39:37.592
Come on! Hurry up!

39:46.175 --> 39:47.801
Secure the gate!

39:58.938 --> 40:00.911
Come on!

40:02.358 --> 40:04.160
Master Hubert!

40:05.320 --> 40:07.372
We need you on the wall!

40:23.379 --> 40:26.148
Come on, you men! Fight back!

40:36.309 --> 40:37.906
(LAUGHS)

40:39.771 --> 40:41.994
Fight them back!

41:04.045 --> 41:06.347
Come on, then!

41:07.715 --> 41:09.813
Come on!

41:21.396 --> 41:24.606
(GROANING)

41:24.607 --> 41:26.191
Ahh! Ahh!

41:26.192 --> 41:28.151
No, Father!

41:28.152 --> 41:30.862
I have to be out there.

41:30.863 --> 41:33.006
No, Father, please!

41:33.700 --> 41:35.502
Push 'em off the walls!

41:36.911 --> 41:39.204
Push 'em down!

41:39.205 --> 41:41.303
Come on, lads! Push 'em back!

41:50.591 --> 41:53.552
(LAUGHS) I'm lovin' it!

41:53.553 --> 41:55.429
Get back, you scum!

41:55.430 --> 41:57.573
There, you scum!

42:10.194 --> 42:11.903
They're on the run!

42:11.904 --> 42:13.905
The Scots are retreating!

42:13.906 --> 42:16.459
Retreat! Fall back!

43:24.268 --> 43:26.286
Well done.

43:26.813 --> 43:29.106
Smith.

43:29.107 --> 43:31.409
How's Father?

43:42.120 --> 43:44.297
Welcome home.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.040
Be gentle with him.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.093
- He needs rest.
- Yes.

43:51.879 --> 43:55.382
- Welcome, dear nephew.
- Aunt.

43:55.383 --> 43:58.552
- I found Cousin Guy.
- (SIGHS)

43:58.553 --> 44:01.026
You've done well.

44:01.931 --> 44:03.515
- You brought others?
- Three.

44:03.516 --> 44:06.059
- From the devil himself.
- (CHUCKLES)

44:06.060 --> 44:09.455
Then our enemies must beware.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.493
Come.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.738
Uncle.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.532
I'm glad you've come.

44:20.533 --> 44:24.007
Though we could have wished
for better circumstances.

44:25.621 --> 44:29.124
I'm no stranger to your
circumstances anymore.

44:29.125 --> 44:34.754
It will take more than a few mountain
men to bring this house down.

44:34.755 --> 44:38.258
It's been in my family
for three generations.

44:38.259 --> 44:41.733
And no matter what happens to me,

44:42.096 --> 44:45.115
we will not give it up.

44:45.975 --> 44:47.822
He needs to rest.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.900
I didn't like the look of Father.

44:54.901 --> 44:56.953
I've seen men come through worse.

45:07.246 --> 45:12.268
Well, well. You didn't tell me the spoiled
princess had grown into such a beauty.

45:14.086 --> 45:16.546
It's a pity the same could
not be said for my cousin.

45:16.547 --> 45:18.975
Oh, and a sharp tongue too, I see.

45:20.134 --> 45:23.313
I'm surprised my cousin
can see anything at all.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.532
Please excuse me.

45:31.812 --> 45:36.037
Don't worry. You're not the only
one she sniffs her nose at.

46:06.639 --> 46:10.364
- They fared well.
- I told you they were a hearty bunch.

46:14.355 --> 46:15.998
Cousin.

46:16.816 --> 46:20.277
Oh, this beauty I remember.

46:20.278 --> 46:24.406
Though last time I saw you, you were
playing in a field wearing leggings.

46:24.407 --> 46:27.460
You must tell me of the rebellion.
How you fought the king himself.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.843
Well another time, maybe.

46:32.790 --> 46:36.390
We need as many as we can
get back on the walls.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.013
MAN: Come on!

46:48.014 --> 46:50.056
Keep going. Keep going.

46:50.057 --> 46:52.860
(CHATTERING)

47:02.695 --> 47:05.280
You and your friend.

47:05.281 --> 47:07.424
It's good to see people
happy at their work.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.285
Well, we've had a lot of practice.

47:10.286 --> 47:13.246
(CHUCKLES)
Some don't have a taste for it.

47:13.247 --> 47:18.394
But as my dear father and his
before him used to say...

47:19.086 --> 47:20.545
"It is a trade, Son.

47:20.546 --> 47:25.602
Be proud when they
kneel before you."

47:28.095 --> 47:30.238
We didn't get around to names.

47:33.100 --> 47:35.769
Charles Montserrat de Pierrepoint.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.645
The Third.

47:37.646 --> 47:40.244
Guy de Lusignan.

47:41.776 --> 47:44.819
You are the pride of your
profession, Mr. Pierrepoint.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.542
Pleasure.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.641
We need you on the walls.

48:18.979 --> 48:21.702
Is that all my master needs?

48:34.995 --> 48:37.639
No, stop. No.

48:45.089 --> 48:47.562
- Hey!

- Ohh!
- Ohh!

MAN 3: Scum.

50:16.639 --> 50:20.767
- MAN 1: We should attack tomorrow.
- MAN 4: Tomorrow!

50:20.768 --> 50:22.894
MAN 5:
But now they have hired swords.

50:24.605 --> 50:28.274

- MAN 2: Throw them out to the hounds.
- MAN 3: Aye. Throw them out.

50:32.905 --> 50:34.739
Each one of us...

50:34.740 --> 50:38.326
feels your loss.

50:38.327 --> 50:42.121
- But we will kill them.
- MAN: Kill them all!

50:42.122 --> 50:45.250
How many sisters and
brothers are sacrificed...

50:45.251 --> 50:47.929
for one dead son?

50:50.464 --> 50:52.340
CHIEFTAIN: How many?

50:52.341 --> 50:54.268
My wife.

50:55.636 --> 50:57.637
My daughters.

50:57.638 --> 51:00.236
Raped and murdered by the English.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.828
Now my son is with them.

51:05.688 --> 51:08.189
- The last of my blood.

51:08.190 --> 51:11.835
How many of you know the same?

51:21.370 --> 51:25.290

51:25.291 --> 51:27.875
the way you fight us.

Yes, ma'am.

Master Hubert! Your
mother's asking for you.

52:12.713 --> 52:14.560
And your cousin.

There is little time.

52:37.237 --> 52:41.417
This place is not just our home.

52:42.493 --> 52:47.121
It is the shelter of
every soul within it.

52:47.122 --> 52:52.585
Built with toil and sweat...

52:52.586 --> 52:56.186
in the hope of a better life.

53:00.386 --> 53:04.263
And when God cannot give us that,

53:04.264 --> 53:06.224
these stone walls...

53:06.225 --> 53:08.027
become our shield.

53:09.061 --> 53:11.604
A sanctuary from danger.

53:11.605 --> 53:16.081
They protect us like
the steel of a sword.

53:17.152 --> 53:22.115
My grandfather was of

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.855
Water!

Give me that.

Keep that water coming!

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:13.172
We have to retreat to the keep.

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:15.976
Go. Go!

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:18.816
To the keep!

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:37.751
Come on!

Mercenary.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:21.716
Knew you would come soon enough.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.394

Smith, come on!

01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:55.867
Go!

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:16.675
English!

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:29.730
Where's Mother?

01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:32.941
Go with her. Go.

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:35.865
Quickly.

01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:51.714
Burn it.

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:57.136
Burn it! Burn it!

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:08.398
(SOBBING)

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:26.294
HUBERT: What are we to do?

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:36.232
I made a promise. I will fight for
this place until my last breath.

01:29:36.258 --> 01:29:37.910
How noble of you.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:41.709
There's nothing noble in killing.

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:45.421
Not for freedom, not for
God, not for money.

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:49.174
Somebody told me that once before.
Except without the money.

01:29:49.175 --> 01:29:52.428
The money isn't why you came. You
came because you knew it was right.

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.972
- What do you know of what is right?
- I know what is blood.

01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:58.183
- Are we not family?
- (POUNDING, CRASHING)

01:29:58.184 --> 01:29:59.686
Go. Take your sisters
to the upper chamber.

01:29:59.712 --> 01:30:01.538
- No.
- This is no time to argue.

01:30:01.564 --> 01:30:03.364
That is why you will
go with my sisters.

01:30:03.365 --> 01:30:06.268
A master defends his own castle.

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.044
Break it up.

01:30:20.206 --> 01:30:21.803
Move!

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:28.807
- What are they doing?
- We should have stayed with Hubert.

(POUNDING CONTINUES)

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.293
The thing that you saw
between me and Berenger...

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.937
Don't.

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:13.397
I shouldn't have brought you here.

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:27.532

- I want to go back to Hubert.
- No, Kate. Stay, stay, stay. Shh. Stay.

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:47.351
You and I...

01:31:48.628 --> 01:31:51.022
and our dear cousin.

01:32:10.108 --> 01:32:12.126
Go in there!

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:48.614
I didn't mean the things I said.

01:32:53.777 --> 01:32:56.079
They have Hubert!

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.207
KATE: Oh, God!

01:33:07.624 --> 01:33:09.333
Oh, God! No.

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:11.978
- (STAMMERING)
- Shh.

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:24.807
Hang her!

01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:27.702
No! No!

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:30.071
No!

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.833
No!

No!

01:34:30.248 --> 01:34:32.550
And now him.

01:34:34.377 --> 01:34:36.975
<i>GUY'S VOICE: This is my family!</i>

01:34:38.047 --> 01:34:40.816
<i>This is my family and my home!</i>

01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:45.692
<i>Fight me!</i>

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.474
<i>Fight me instead!</i>

01:34:49.475 --> 01:34:51.602
Fight me!

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:54.062
You had a son who died as you
and your men stand there!

01:34:54.063 --> 01:34:57.037
And now let no more of
them die in his name!

01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:02.171
You are a hired sword!

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:05.503
A dog who fights for coin!

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:08.336
Why are you here?

01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:10.746
Bring me the daughters of the lord,

01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:13.248
and you're free to go.

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:15.768
This is my family and my home!

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:19.396
If you have honor for your son...

01:35:20.006 --> 01:35:24.436
for your own blood, then fight me!

01:35:24.844 --> 01:35:27.112
Let us settle this alone!

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:37.953
Wait.

01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:04.877
A dog finding his way
home doesn't make a son.

01:37:05.862 --> 01:37:09.132
Nor does blood alone make a father.
