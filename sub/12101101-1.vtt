WEBVTT

02:20.993 --> 02:22.703
Hello?

02:25.539 --> 02:26.582
Are you OK in there?

02:32.213 --> 02:33.422
Fuck yeah!

02:37.385 --> 02:38.719
Hey, guys.

02:38.803 --> 02:39.845
I really gotta pee

02:39.929 --> 02:41.972
and there's two jackasses
in the bathroom

02:42.098 --> 02:44.183
- screwing around.
- That'd be Tom and Janet.

02:44.266 --> 02:46.352
Yeah, you're better off
peeing off the balcony.

02:47.353 --> 02:49.188
- Really?
- They'll be a while.

02:49.397 --> 02:51.232
- Just... great.
- There's good.

02:57.029 --> 02:58.531
So, they've done this before?

02:58.614 --> 03:00.199
Yeah, every time they come here.

03:00.658 --> 03:01.617
What?

03:01.826 --> 03:04.453
I mean, who am I to judge
a young, dating couple

03:04.537 --> 03:05.871
and their hormones, right?

03:05.955 --> 03:07.873
- They're not young.
- Yeah, and they're not dating.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.500
Are they newlyweds
or something?

03:09.625 --> 03:11.085
No, they've been together
14 years.

03:11.252 --> 03:13.337
Fuck off! Are you serious?

03:14.046 --> 03:16.132
You're trying to tell me that
a couple that's been married

03:16.215 --> 03:17.383
- for 14 years...
- Arthur!

03:17.466 --> 03:19.176
This is Tom and Janet.

03:19.260 --> 03:20.511
Oh. Arthur, is it?

03:20.594 --> 03:21.971
It is. Nice to meet you.

03:22.054 --> 03:23.806
Oh, hi. I'm Janet.
I'm his wife.

03:24.598 --> 03:26.726
- Cool.
- We've been married 14 years.

03:28.060 --> 03:29.645
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, when you walked up

03:29.729 --> 03:31.188
you were saying something
about a couple

03:31.272 --> 03:32.606
that's been married 14 years?

03:35.276 --> 03:37.027
I don't... I don't think I was

03:37.111 --> 03:38.946
actually, I was maybe misheard.

03:38.988 --> 03:41.282
- Arthur and I work together.
- Oh, really?

03:41.574 --> 03:43.200
God, that must be so much fun.

03:44.368 --> 03:46.454
Yeah. It's fun as shit.

03:46.996 --> 03:49.373
- Unfortunately, we have to go.
- Oh!

03:49.457 --> 03:51.625
Thank you for the invite.
It was a great party.

03:51.709 --> 03:52.877
- Drive safe.
- Bye, guys.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.961
Yeah.

03:54.211 --> 03:56.255
Safe drive for you.

03:56.839 --> 03:57.882
They're pod people.

03:58.007 --> 04:00.176
- They're going home for round 2.
- What?

04:04.430 --> 04:05.805
That was just the pre-fuck.

04:06.139 --> 04:07.432
- Bullshit!
- Nope.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.520
It's gotta be an act.
I don't buy it.

04:12.688 --> 04:14.565
I guarantee you,
those people are just

04:14.648 --> 04:15.858
as miserable as everybody else.

04:23.449 --> 04:25.159
I fucking love you.

04:26.077 --> 04:27.453
I fucking love you, too.

06:00.504 --> 06:02.465
Hey. Karen texted me.

06:02.798 --> 06:04.383
They wanna get dinner tonight.

06:08.637 --> 06:10.014
You OK with that?

06:12.558 --> 06:13.601
Sure.

06:16.687 --> 06:18.564
Hey, babe?
Can you make me an omelette?

06:22.985 --> 06:24.653
Sure.

07:03.192 --> 07:04.235
Hi, baby.

07:06.278 --> 07:07.947
You cleaned!

07:10.324 --> 07:12.785
And you did all the laundry.

07:13.369 --> 07:15.496
Just trying to make
things easier for my girl.

07:15.663 --> 07:16.872
Oh...

07:17.873 --> 07:19.625
- Long day?
- Ugh!

07:19.834 --> 07:21.001
Mm-hmm.

07:22.628 --> 07:23.838
I expected that.

07:31.178 --> 07:33.639
A massage for me?

07:34.724 --> 07:36.517
I didn't treat you right
this morning.

07:36.976 --> 07:38.227
Oh, that's OK.

07:38.769 --> 07:41.313
I never should have asked you
to make that omelette.

07:42.398 --> 07:43.816
I could've made that omelette.

07:44.483 --> 07:46.152
Oh, babe.

07:46.569 --> 07:48.988
Now, how about you lie down
on the bed

07:49.071 --> 07:50.489
and I'll make you feel better?

07:51.365 --> 07:55.244
Well, there's another way
you could make me feel better.

07:56.787 --> 07:58.164
And that is...?

08:03.753 --> 08:04.920
Oh, hey.

08:05.337 --> 08:06.756
Did you get any writing
done today?

08:06.839 --> 08:07.923
Oh, yeah.

08:08.174 --> 08:09.550
I finished a chapter.

08:10.217 --> 08:11.343
Oh!

08:11.469 --> 08:12.762
I'm so proud of you.

08:14.722 --> 08:16.640
Man, I'm hungry.

08:16.724 --> 08:18.559
Oh, me too.

08:19.685 --> 08:21.270
What do you wanna do for dinner?

08:22.479 --> 08:23.439
Dinner!

08:27.818 --> 08:29.487
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

08:29.570 --> 08:30.820
Sorry we're late.

08:31.947 --> 08:34.533
We lost track of time and, uh...

08:35.034 --> 08:36.952
You know how it is.

08:37.036 --> 08:38.662
Yeah. No, no, we don't.

08:38.746 --> 08:40.873
Oh! I could eat
the whole fucking menu.

08:42.083 --> 08:43.292
Some bread?

08:45.086 --> 08:47.421
Thank you. Dinner was great.

08:48.881 --> 08:50.341
We need to talk
about this weekend.

08:50.508 --> 08:52.259
Oh, yeah. We are very excited.

08:52.343 --> 08:53.594
Thank you for inviting us.

08:53.677 --> 08:55.763
It's gonna be great to get out
of town for a little bit.

08:58.391 --> 08:59.683
What is this?

08:59.767 --> 09:01.394
That is your deposit.

09:01.685 --> 09:02.812
I don't understand.

09:03.062 --> 09:06.357
Uh, it seems that's there's one
less room than we thought, so...

09:07.566 --> 09:08.526
Less rooms?

09:08.692 --> 09:10.319
Yeah.
We're just one couple over.

09:10.403 --> 09:12.196
We're really sorry
that we have to do this.

09:12.363 --> 09:14.115
Oh, no! It's no problem at all.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.659
We can... we'll sleep
on a couch or anywhere, really.

09:16.742 --> 09:18.327
- We're easy.
- No, no, no, no.

09:18.411 --> 09:20.121
You guys...
Too much money...

09:20.204 --> 09:22.998
Don't worry about the money.
We're fine.

09:23.416 --> 09:25.459
- OK, well, I think...
- Everyone hates you.

09:28.629 --> 09:29.713
What?

09:29.797 --> 09:30.965
Nobody hates us!

09:31.674 --> 09:32.842
Why would they hate us?

09:32.967 --> 09:34.468
Cos you're
a fucking nightmare.

09:38.431 --> 09:39.974
You really don't get it, do you?

09:40.725 --> 09:43.811
OK. Tom, before
they brought the food out

09:44.437 --> 09:46.147
you slipped a napkin
over to your wife.

09:47.898 --> 09:48.899
Maybe.

09:51.402 --> 09:53.195
Did you write something on it?

09:56.991 --> 09:58.159
No.

09:58.993 --> 10:01.871
Janet, you were texting
during dinner, right?

10:02.872 --> 10:04.206
I don't know, I...

10:04.290 --> 10:05.958
I would have to check.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.793
It was your husband,
wasn't it?

10:07.877 --> 10:09.628
I'm sor... Uh...
What was the question?

10:09.712 --> 10:12.506
We have tolerated
this ridiculous behaviour

10:12.673 --> 10:13.799
for so long

10:13.883 --> 10:15.426
but we can't do it anymore.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.303
Ridiculous behaviour?

10:17.386 --> 10:19.096
Oh, come on.
You never fight.

10:19.555 --> 10:21.265
You're always so happy,
always in love.

10:21.390 --> 10:23.059
You can't keep your hands off
each other

10:23.142 --> 10:25.853
for five goddamn seconds,
and it's just so weird.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.897
We love each other.

10:28.022 --> 10:30.066
I mean, isn't that what people
who love each other do?

10:31.442 --> 10:33.611
You're fucking Martians, OK?

10:37.823 --> 10:39.450
Is this how
the whole group feels?

10:39.700 --> 10:40.993
- Yes.
- 100%, yes.

10:41.077 --> 10:42.328
One thousand per cent.

10:43.329 --> 10:44.622
Two thousand per cent.

10:48.542 --> 10:49.710
Uh...

10:50.086 --> 10:52.838
I can see that you guys
are upset.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.758
But if you're unhappy

10:55.841 --> 10:58.302
or there's something wrong
with your marriage

10:59.136 --> 11:00.262
that's not on us.

11:01.097 --> 11:02.973
I love my wife.

11:03.057 --> 11:04.225
She loves me.

11:04.308 --> 11:05.393
She's my best friend.

11:05.851 --> 11:07.228
I enjoy her company.

11:07.436 --> 11:09.688
And I'm never gonna apologise
for that.

11:12.358 --> 11:13.984
We are not the weird ones.

11:19.657 --> 11:20.866
You just grabbed his dick,
didn't you?

11:20.991 --> 11:22.118
What? No.

11:22.201 --> 11:24.412
I dropped...
I dropped something.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.164
I did.

11:37.591 --> 11:40.052
Babe, we're not the weird ones.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.054
- No.
- OK? They're not happy.

11:42.138 --> 11:43.514
That has nothing to do with us.

11:43.597 --> 11:44.640
You're right. You're right.

11:44.724 --> 11:46.100
- We're cool.
- Yeah, totally.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.269
This is the way marriage
is supposed to be.

11:48.519 --> 11:50.104
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

11:51.397 --> 11:53.691
We're not... Martians.

11:53.899 --> 11:54.900
Mmm.

11:57.486 --> 11:58.738
Oh...

11:59.280 --> 12:00.531
I love you.

12:37.318 --> 12:38.736
Nicely done.

12:40.654 --> 12:41.697
And...

12:42.198 --> 12:43.240
coffee.

12:43.908 --> 12:45.367
My Martian.

12:59.215 --> 13:01.550
Maybe we could go see
a movie tonight

13:01.634 --> 13:03.010
after I get home...

13:04.178 --> 13:05.137
Uh, hello.

13:06.222 --> 13:07.223
Can I help you?

13:07.306 --> 13:09.517
Yes, ma'am.
I work for the city.

13:10.393 --> 13:11.685
Is there a problem?

13:11.769 --> 13:14.146
There's a matter
I need to discuss with you

13:14.230 --> 13:15.398
and your husband.

13:16.148 --> 13:17.983
Well...
Can we do this later?

13:18.067 --> 13:19.235
I'm on my way to work.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.403
We cannot.

13:20.486 --> 13:23.239
But I promise it will only take
a moment of your time.

13:24.865 --> 13:26.075
OK.

13:26.450 --> 13:27.660
Come on in.

13:37.128 --> 13:38.337
So, you work for the city?

13:38.504 --> 13:39.547
I do not.

13:40.423 --> 13:41.757
- Oh, but you...
- I did say that

13:41.841 --> 13:42.967
but I don't.

13:44.969 --> 13:47.638
It was the only way you'd
let me through the front door.

13:50.224 --> 13:53.728
We are prepared
to take full responsibility

13:53.811 --> 13:54.979
for our mishap.

13:56.105 --> 13:57.857
- Mishap?
- Yes.

13:58.274 --> 14:01.485
I think we're gonna need some
kind of an explanation here.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.530
You see, every few years

14:04.655 --> 14:07.241
we encounter someone with a...

14:07.908 --> 14:08.868
defect.

14:10.244 --> 14:13.873
But two people
with a malfunction

14:14.498 --> 14:15.708
that...

14:15.916 --> 14:18.836
that is what we call a rarity.

14:25.217 --> 14:26.761
The law of diminished returns

14:26.844 --> 14:29.972
is a biological
defense mechanism.

14:31.265 --> 14:35.394
Perception and enjoyment
taper off as time goes by.

14:35.686 --> 14:36.729
This is by design.

14:36.812 --> 14:39.023
It is a primary element
of your survival.

14:39.523 --> 14:40.941
- Design?
- Survival?

14:41.400 --> 14:42.359
Yes.

14:42.610 --> 14:44.403
You two, both of you, are...

14:45.071 --> 14:46.822
missing this mechanism.

14:48.949 --> 14:50.076
Bullshit.

14:51.243 --> 14:53.579
You have sex every day

14:54.121 --> 14:55.915
2.5 times a day on average.

14:57.917 --> 15:00.461
I'm talking about
traditional intercourse.

15:01.629 --> 15:03.464
I'm not even including
oral pleasure

15:03.547 --> 15:05.883
or various forms of foreplay.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.178
You rarely fight

15:09.470 --> 15:12.973
and when you do, you forgive
each other almost immediately.

15:14.058 --> 15:15.309
I could've made that omelette.

15:15.935 --> 15:18.604
And I'm talking about
actual forgiveness.

15:18.687 --> 15:20.314
No accumulated resentment.

15:20.398 --> 15:22.024
No passive-aggressive behaviour.

15:22.316 --> 15:24.026
Sir, I don't know
who the hell you are.

15:25.653 --> 15:26.695
Now.

15:29.949 --> 15:30.866
Ah.

15:34.286 --> 15:35.788
Your problems...

15:36.789 --> 15:38.290
end today.

15:41.001 --> 15:42.461
After the injections

15:43.295 --> 15:46.674
you will wake up tomorrow
just like everyone else.

15:46.757 --> 15:50.386
You'll feel exactly
like everyone else.

15:53.848 --> 15:56.225
Oh, and we are also prepared
to give you

15:56.308 --> 15:58.519
a financial compensation

15:59.353 --> 16:00.980
as a token of our apology.

16:03.441 --> 16:05.359
I'd like you to leave our house.

16:05.443 --> 16:06.527
Afraid I can't do that.

16:06.610 --> 16:08.279
Yeah, I'll throw you out
the goddamn door.

16:08.362 --> 16:10.448
- That will not work.
- Then we'll call the cops.

16:10.573 --> 16:11.866
There's nothing
they can do here.

16:11.949 --> 16:14.368
There's nothing anyone
can do here.

16:16.746 --> 16:20.207
We operate on a higher level
of authority.

16:21.584 --> 16:24.962
If you need a minute or two
to process this information

16:25.045 --> 16:27.006
that's perfectly acceptable,
but...

16:27.173 --> 16:29.049
please understand, this

16:29.925 --> 16:31.385
is a good thing.

16:32.428 --> 16:34.722
You will finally be normal.

16:35.556 --> 16:37.141
This is fucking lunacy.

16:37.349 --> 16:38.934
Are you OK, sweetie?

16:39.518 --> 16:41.270
Why don't you go get
a glass of water?

16:50.279 --> 16:52.990
I don't understand.
Do we have to take the shot?

16:53.074 --> 16:54.908
- We don't have a choice?
- No.

16:55.117 --> 16:57.286
You do not have a choice
in the matter

16:57.369 --> 16:59.955
and I'm not leaving
until I inject both of you.

17:38.494 --> 17:39.870
I didn't know what to do.

17:45.209 --> 17:46.502
I forgive you.

17:51.215 --> 17:55.636
How to get rid of a dead body...

17:57.847 --> 17:59.056
Here we go.

18:00.725 --> 18:03.561
"He became a person of interest

18:03.644 --> 18:06.188
when the police found
his search history."

18:13.571 --> 18:14.780
Number one...

18:15.239 --> 18:17.408
chopping up a body.

18:18.951 --> 18:20.661
- I don't wanna chop up a body.
- No.

18:20.745 --> 18:22.830
- Seems difficult.
- Yeah, I won't do that.

18:22.913 --> 18:24.206
OK. Number two...

18:24.832 --> 18:25.958
acid.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.294
- How would that work?
- I don't know, but remember

18:28.377 --> 18:30.504
they did it on that episode
of <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

18:34.008 --> 18:34.967
- Oh.
- Ew.

18:35.051 --> 18:36.385
- No.
- No, that was gross.

18:36.469 --> 18:37.428
Body soup.

18:37.511 --> 18:39.388
I think we're
over-complicating this.

18:52.109 --> 18:53.277
You OK?

18:57.156 --> 18:58.282
I...

18:59.492 --> 19:00.701
I did this.

19:01.327 --> 19:02.703
It was self-defense.

19:03.162 --> 19:04.330
Yeah, but it...

19:04.538 --> 19:06.874
It was self-defense.

19:09.877 --> 19:11.003
- OK.
- OK.

19:11.170 --> 19:12.254
OK.

19:20.763 --> 19:23.599
Somebody is going
to come looking for him.

19:23.724 --> 19:24.975
We don't know that.

19:25.059 --> 19:26.435
Yes, we do.

19:26.685 --> 19:28.521
And I don't want to be here
when that happens.

19:28.604 --> 19:29.730
Where do you wanna go?

19:29.814 --> 19:33.150
I don't know. Anywhere.
I mean, literally anywhere.

19:33.651 --> 19:35.528
Oh, my God.

19:38.364 --> 19:40.449
- Should I?
- Go ahead.

19:42.326 --> 19:43.661
Hi, Karen!

19:43.744 --> 19:45.788
<i>I just wanted
to call and apologise.</i>

19:45.871 --> 19:47.915
<i>I think we may have been
a little harsh last night.</i>

19:48.207 --> 19:49.333
Thanks.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.293
<i>Look, if you guys
are still interested</i>

19:51.377 --> 19:52.711
<i>in getting out of town
for the weekend</i>

19:52.795 --> 19:54.755
<i>we'd love for you to come
on the couple's trip.</i>

19:57.591 --> 20:00.386
Uh, I...
That sounds great.

20:00.469 --> 20:02.138
We would love to.

20:02.304 --> 20:03.305
<i>Perfect.</i>

20:03.389 --> 20:05.725
<i>I'll text you the address
and the code for the front gate.</i>

20:06.142 --> 20:07.476
Amazing!

20:08.477 --> 20:10.604
See you tomorrow. Bye.

20:13.107 --> 20:14.400
Is this a good idea?

20:14.734 --> 20:16.193
You said anywhere.

20:59.403 --> 21:01.614
Someone's gonna come
looking for him, right?

21:01.989 --> 21:03.824
- Yeah.
- Evidence.

21:05.117 --> 21:06.494
Oh, shit.

21:06.786 --> 21:08.287
Because he was never here.

21:23.844 --> 21:25.054
- Holy shit.
- What?

21:25.137 --> 21:26.389
What is it? What's wrong?

21:27.473 --> 21:29.308
- Holy shit.
- What?

21:31.435 --> 21:32.645
It was a prank.

21:33.646 --> 21:34.939
What was a prank?

21:35.398 --> 21:36.565
The whole thing.

21:36.649 --> 21:38.484
The guy, the briefcase.

21:38.776 --> 21:40.319
Someone was fucking with us.

21:41.487 --> 21:42.655
Think about it.

21:43.322 --> 21:44.824
One of two things happened.

21:44.990 --> 21:46.158
Option one...

21:46.492 --> 21:48.869
Some guy
from a mysterious organisation

21:48.953 --> 21:51.205
shows up to our door
with a briefcase

21:51.497 --> 21:54.834
and a big speech
about how our marriage

21:54.917 --> 21:56.377
is some kind of accident

21:56.502 --> 21:58.629
or option two...

21:59.255 --> 22:01.507
one of our friends
thought they would be funny

22:01.590 --> 22:04.510
and send some guy,
probably an actor, to our door

22:04.593 --> 22:07.763
with a ridiculous speech
about how our happiness

22:08.222 --> 22:10.099
was some kind of malfunction.

22:11.809 --> 22:13.936
I mean, which scenario
makes more sense?

22:15.855 --> 22:17.565
Oh, my God, it was a prank.

22:18.065 --> 22:20.276
- It was a fucking prank.
- Yeah.

22:24.780 --> 22:26.073
And we killed him.

22:27.950 --> 22:30.286
Holy shit. Holy fucking shit.

22:33.914 --> 22:35.875
That's why they re-invited us.

22:36.041 --> 22:37.084
He never called.

22:37.334 --> 22:39.420
And they knew
that something went wrong.

22:41.756 --> 22:43.007
What are we gonna do?

22:43.966 --> 22:46.385
We have to pretend
like nothing ever happened.

22:46.510 --> 22:47.803
We can't seem suspicious.

22:47.887 --> 22:50.222
- He never showed up to our door.
- Exactly.

22:56.353 --> 22:57.563
Who do you think it was?

22:57.813 --> 22:58.981
I don't know.

22:59.148 --> 23:00.858
It could be Val and Karen

23:01.275 --> 23:02.818
Patricia, Donald

23:03.652 --> 23:05.571
Carla and Maude, Richard.

23:05.780 --> 23:07.531
I don't...
it could be everybody.

23:11.368 --> 23:12.953
There's only one way
to find out.

23:21.253 --> 23:22.630
- Code?
- Oh, yeah.

23:23.255 --> 23:24.548
3-9-2.

23:27.009 --> 23:28.719
- And then you push pound.
- Yeah.

23:44.860 --> 23:47.655
It's just a regular
couple's weekend.

23:47.780 --> 23:48.948
- Right.
- Yeah.

23:50.658 --> 23:52.076
We're here to have a good time.

23:52.159 --> 23:53.786
Sweet good times.

24:05.923 --> 24:07.258
Someone's already here.

24:07.967 --> 24:09.885
- You recognise that car?
- No.

24:18.102 --> 24:20.187
Hey! The first couple
has arrived.

24:20.271 --> 24:21.439
- Hey!
- Well, besides me

24:21.522 --> 24:22.690
and dumbass Donald.

24:23.065 --> 24:24.817
How did we land a place so nice?

24:24.900 --> 24:26.569
Oh, five couples
is the magic number.

24:26.652 --> 24:28.320
This shit's expensive,
but we split it

24:28.404 --> 24:30.740
five ways and we get to spend
the weekend in style.

24:31.407 --> 24:33.784
- Is, uh... Is that your car?
- No.

24:33.868 --> 24:36.537
No, the Lexus is in the shop.
That's just the shitty loaner.

24:36.620 --> 24:37.872
Oh, no, I like the...

24:37.955 --> 24:39.749
- I like the... colour of it.
- Mmm.

24:40.499 --> 24:42.084
Nobody likes that colour, girl.

24:42.501 --> 24:43.794
That car is trash.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.130
Let me show you
round the nice place.

24:46.213 --> 24:47.798
Donald went for a swim.

24:48.007 --> 24:49.925
- There's a pool?
- And a hot tub.

24:50.009 --> 24:51.927
- Who wants a tour?
- Oh, I do.

24:57.683 --> 25:00.978
Here's the living
room and the fireplace

25:01.228 --> 25:04.315
and the bar where we're all
gonna get hammered later.

25:04.565 --> 25:06.609
I even saw some puzzles
if you're into that

25:06.692 --> 25:07.985
kinda nerdy thing.

25:08.569 --> 25:09.862
Look at these doors.

25:10.154 --> 25:12.281
It's like we're in a goddamn
sci-fi movie.

25:14.158 --> 25:16.660
Wait. Whatever happened
to <i>MTV Cribs?</i>

25:16.744 --> 25:18.162
I feel like I'd be great at it.

25:18.871 --> 25:20.956
<i>We are all
interested in the future</i>

25:21.040 --> 25:23.209
<i>for that is where you and I
are going to spend</i>

25:23.292 --> 25:24.752
<i>the rest of our lives.</i>

25:24.835 --> 25:26.128
And there's a screening room.

25:26.212 --> 25:27.797
- Cool!
- Wonder what movies they have?

25:27.880 --> 25:29.131
Oh, this black and white one

25:29.215 --> 25:31.550
<i>Hudson Hawk</i> and <i>The Adventures
of Ford Fairlane.</i>

25:31.675 --> 25:33.094
Here is the kitchen.

25:33.260 --> 25:34.845
- I mean, check this out.
- Wow!

25:34.929 --> 25:36.680
Built-in
espresso maker.

25:36.764 --> 25:37.723
Oh, my God.

25:37.807 --> 25:39.683
Fancy microwave.

25:40.309 --> 25:42.311
Camouflage refrigerator.

25:43.187 --> 25:44.438
Yeah, this place is great.

25:44.522 --> 25:46.857
This is the sink.
Tom can take a bath in there.

25:46.941 --> 25:48.192
- Like a bath tub.
- I mean, the stove

25:48.275 --> 25:50.569
isn't as good as the one
in my house but this'll do.

25:50.653 --> 25:52.113
Oh, maybe Val will cook for us.

25:52.196 --> 25:54.615
No, he said he doesn't wanna
"work on vacation".

25:54.907 --> 25:56.450
I was like, "Fuck you, Val.

25:56.575 --> 25:59.161
Make us something delicious,
man!" Chefs suck.

25:59.412 --> 26:02.540
Any room on this floor is yours
for the taking

26:02.623 --> 26:05.167
except for the master,
because I found this place

26:05.251 --> 26:06.669
I call dibs.
Them's the rules.

26:08.129 --> 26:10.673
- Oh, how about this one?
- Oh, no, that's not a bedroom.

26:13.759 --> 26:15.803
- What the hell?
- Oh, uh, yeah.

26:15.886 --> 26:18.389
The owner of this house
is a big game hunter.

26:21.350 --> 26:23.269
Rich people love
to shoot things.

26:23.853 --> 26:25.771
Who am I to judge
the wealthy, huh?

26:26.856 --> 26:28.983
Shall we find you guys
a real bedroom

26:29.066 --> 26:30.234
that you can sleep in?

26:31.193 --> 26:32.653
So there's a gun room?

26:33.112 --> 26:35.448
Is there a strange room
filled with guns?

26:35.531 --> 26:37.199
Yes.
Is that normal?

26:37.491 --> 26:38.534
Probably not.

26:38.617 --> 26:40.745
But let's focus on the positive,
shall we?

26:40.828 --> 26:42.621
We are in a super cool mansion.

26:42.705 --> 26:45.332
There's a pool,
there are puzzles

26:45.416 --> 26:47.168
there's automatic doors.

26:47.251 --> 26:48.836
What else could you want
in a house?

26:48.919 --> 26:50.588
We're gonna have
a killer weekend.

26:54.717 --> 26:56.510
Hella nice, am I right?

26:57.595 --> 26:59.013
Like I said, it'll do.

27:01.182 --> 27:03.309
You're telling me this
isn't the master bedroom?

27:03.434 --> 27:04.935
No, they're all this big.

27:06.479 --> 27:08.898
Hey, um, not to get too serious

27:08.981 --> 27:11.317
but I'm happy that you're here.

27:11.650 --> 27:13.235
I'm glad they changed
their minds.

27:13.652 --> 27:17.823
Oh, so... you didn't vote us
off the island?

27:18.157 --> 27:19.909
No, somebody's gotta
have your back.

27:20.034 --> 27:21.619
It wasn't a unanimous decision?

27:22.828 --> 27:25.372
You know what?
Who cares about all that drama

27:25.456 --> 27:28.042
right now, right?
Like, it's party time.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.460
It's not drama time.

27:29.752 --> 27:30.753
Hm.

27:31.170 --> 27:32.671
I'll let you two get situated.

27:33.214 --> 27:35.132
I know you need
your private time.

27:38.010 --> 27:39.929
We're not gonna have sex.

27:40.137 --> 27:41.097
Uh-huh.

27:44.475 --> 27:47.436
If it was a prank, I don't think
Patricia was a part of it.

27:47.645 --> 27:48.896
She was perfectly normal.

27:49.522 --> 27:52.316
What about me?
Was I perfectly normal?

27:53.359 --> 27:54.318
What do you mean?

27:54.402 --> 27:56.946
I mean, was it obvious
that I killed a guy

27:57.029 --> 27:58.739
and buried him in the woods
last night?

27:59.156 --> 28:01.200
You didn't give off
that vibe at all.

28:01.784 --> 28:02.910
Awesome.

28:05.746 --> 28:06.997
What about Donald?

28:08.958 --> 28:11.168
Maybe you should go
have a chat.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.338
See if he goes on
the list of suspects.

28:15.172 --> 28:16.465
I'll suit up.

28:41.198 --> 28:42.700
That's why I play percussion.

28:53.544 --> 28:55.671
Just gonna send this email
and then I will be

28:55.796 --> 28:56.922
completely ready.

28:57.423 --> 28:58.549
That's OK. I got it.

28:58.632 --> 29:00.384
Sure? You got yours?
OK. I'll grab mine.

29:01.969 --> 29:03.012
OK.

29:04.055 --> 29:05.181
It's nice.

29:05.598 --> 29:06.807
Yeah.
It's really nice.

29:08.059 --> 29:10.019
- They did good.
- Yeah. They really did.

29:16.567 --> 29:17.985
Is that their fucking car?

29:19.528 --> 29:20.863
- Hey!
- Hi.

29:20.988 --> 29:22.490
- Hey.
- Um...

29:22.573 --> 29:23.824
I thought you
uninvited them.

29:23.908 --> 29:25.951
Carla, Maude,
good to see you.

29:26.118 --> 29:27.119
- Hi!
- Hey!

29:27.203 --> 29:29.705
Oh, my God.
It's great to see you too.

29:29.872 --> 29:31.248
Oh, wow.
I'm so glad you made it.

29:31.457 --> 29:32.875
Well, I'm gonna go to the pool.

29:34.168 --> 29:36.003
Just to be clear,
it's not great to see them

29:36.087 --> 29:37.797
and I'm really not glad
they made it.

29:37.880 --> 29:38.923
That was clear.

29:47.723 --> 29:48.849
How's it going, Donald?

29:51.602 --> 29:53.104
Forgot you guys were coming out.

29:56.482 --> 29:57.566
Yeah, we made it.

29:58.025 --> 29:59.193
Enjoying the pool?

30:01.153 --> 30:02.196
Yeah.

30:08.411 --> 30:09.829
Can I have one of those beers?

30:17.962 --> 30:19.713
Can I have one of those beers,
Donald?

30:21.841 --> 30:23.259
Sorry, man. Yeah. Sure.

30:25.845 --> 30:27.054
Thanks.

30:30.641 --> 30:31.851
Psych!

30:34.603 --> 30:35.730
Good one.

30:36.647 --> 30:37.732
You got me.

30:43.863 --> 30:44.947
Oh...

30:45.823 --> 30:47.324
Your husband's in a good mood.

30:47.658 --> 30:49.535
Oh?
Was he being a shit?

30:50.327 --> 30:52.121
- You could say that.
- I'm sorry.

30:52.204 --> 30:54.123
That seems to be
his default mode lately.

30:54.665 --> 30:55.833
It's not about me?

30:57.168 --> 30:58.127
No.

30:58.252 --> 31:00.880
No. He just hates the world
and everyone in it.

31:00.963 --> 31:01.881
Trust me.

31:02.465 --> 31:03.924
You guys doing OK?

31:05.342 --> 31:06.844
Was the Hindenburg OK?

31:11.098 --> 31:12.933
Hey, Don-Don.
You enjoy the pool?

31:14.101 --> 31:15.644
Who the fuck is Don-Don?

31:16.437 --> 31:19.190
Figured I'd give everyone fun
nicknames for the weekend.

31:19.565 --> 31:20.983
Can I get a different one?

31:21.067 --> 31:22.860
I don't know if I can
deal with Don-Don.

31:25.780 --> 31:26.989
Nice tits, bro.

31:30.493 --> 31:31.827
To be continued.

31:32.953 --> 31:35.206
Something's going on
with Donald, but...

31:36.165 --> 31:38.167
I don't think
it has anything to do with us.

31:39.794 --> 31:42.129
What about Carla and Maude?

31:42.254 --> 31:43.798
Oh.

31:43.964 --> 31:45.716
I mean, they were
not happy to see me

31:45.800 --> 31:48.469
but I don't know
if that means anything or not.

31:49.136 --> 31:50.513
Is Richard here yet?

31:50.805 --> 31:53.599
Not yet. I guess
he's bringing his fiancé?

31:53.724 --> 31:54.892
Oh! That'll be nice.

31:54.975 --> 31:57.436
- I like Lucile.
- Not Lucile.

31:57.520 --> 31:59.146
I think he got a new one.

31:59.271 --> 32:00.689
Really?
When did that happen?

32:00.898 --> 32:01.899
I don't know.

32:01.982 --> 32:03.776
I guess her name is Gretel?

32:03.984 --> 32:05.319
And she's in a band.

32:06.237 --> 32:10.116
Tricia told me she has, like,
500,000 Instagram followers.

32:17.123 --> 32:18.332
Hello.

32:25.172 --> 32:26.757
We have to pretend like

32:27.049 --> 32:29.719
everything's perfectly normal,
right?

32:29.927 --> 32:32.680
Well, obviously,
it's the most important thing.

32:33.097 --> 32:37.393
Hmm. Well, we have been here
for two whole hours

32:37.476 --> 32:38.686
and we haven't fucked yet.

32:38.769 --> 32:41.355
Hmm.
Someone might get suspicious.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.908
<i>The law...</i>

32:53.409 --> 32:55.077
<i>deception... deception...</i>

32:56.495 --> 32:57.913
<i>I could've made
that omelette.</i>

32:58.247 --> 32:59.623
What if we aren't normal?

33:00.207 --> 33:01.459
Are you OK?

33:02.126 --> 33:03.169
What if...

33:03.961 --> 33:04.962
maybe...

33:05.337 --> 33:06.464
maybe this is weird.

33:06.547 --> 33:08.424
Maybe we are weird.

33:09.341 --> 33:11.761
Maybe there is something
wrong with us.

33:12.511 --> 33:13.929
There's nothing wrong with us.

33:15.431 --> 33:16.640
Do you know what this is?

33:18.184 --> 33:19.435
What? What is it?

33:20.519 --> 33:21.854
This is love, baby.

33:24.690 --> 33:25.858
Oh...

33:29.570 --> 33:30.946
Yeah, you...

33:33.365 --> 33:34.867
Remember where you left off?

33:37.078 --> 33:39.580
Think so.
Alright, my head was here

33:39.663 --> 33:41.248
and I was doing this.

35:19.138 --> 35:21.766
Hey, I was
expecting you guys hours ago.

35:22.016 --> 35:25.352
Yeah, we had some...
complications.

35:25.561 --> 35:26.937
Is everything alright?

35:27.521 --> 35:28.898
It will be.

35:31.734 --> 35:33.736
Richard. Gretel, is it?

35:34.070 --> 35:36.405
- Did you guys carpool with them?
- Yeah.

35:40.201 --> 35:42.995
Patricia, uh, there's something

35:43.746 --> 35:45.206
in the back of our car

35:45.289 --> 35:47.833
I think you're gonna find
interesting.

36:21.367 --> 36:22.827
Mother of God.

36:31.877 --> 36:34.338
Yo! Everybody's here
and Val brought

36:34.422 --> 36:36.257
some motherfucking pizza!

36:38.592 --> 36:40.803
I guess Val brought
some motherfucking pizza.

36:41.387 --> 36:43.222
Could you help me with this?

36:44.598 --> 36:45.725
Thank you.

36:49.562 --> 36:50.563
Ready?

36:50.646 --> 36:51.689
Ready.

36:52.148 --> 36:53.482
So he says to me

36:53.733 --> 36:55.484
"There's something
in the back of my car

36:55.568 --> 36:57.778
you might find interesting."

36:57.987 --> 36:59.447
- Gross.
- And yeah, I know.

36:59.530 --> 37:00.990
He's basically
taunting me, right?

37:01.073 --> 37:04.034
But I go anyway even though,
like, I have no clue

37:04.118 --> 37:05.953
what's gonna be in there,
knowing this guy

37:06.036 --> 37:08.998
it could be
a fucking python or like

37:09.081 --> 37:11.000
I don't know, a dead body maybe?

37:11.083 --> 37:12.334
Oh, stop...

37:12.501 --> 37:14.211
Let me say this
for once and for all.

37:14.295 --> 37:15.546
It was a medical cadaver

37:15.629 --> 37:17.006
it wasn't a real
dead body, OK?

37:17.089 --> 37:18.132
- It was...
- OK.

37:18.215 --> 37:20.551
Well, like, you know,
knowing Val and his antics

37:20.634 --> 37:22.136
- could be anything.
- Wait.

37:22.219 --> 37:23.888
What do you mean
fucking Val's antics?

37:23.971 --> 37:25.306
- What're you talking about?
- Are you telling me

37:25.389 --> 37:26.891
you don't know about
your husband's hobbies?

37:27.099 --> 37:28.476
- No. I don't.
- Just stop.

37:28.559 --> 37:31.979
OK. This guy basically
traumatised me in college.

37:34.857 --> 37:36.859
I may have dabbled
in a prank here and there.

37:36.942 --> 37:38.402
- Oh, gross.
- Here or there.

37:38.486 --> 37:40.696
If I were to describe you
in one sentence from back then

37:40.780 --> 37:42.823
it would be "the guy
who pranks people."

37:42.907 --> 37:44.158
You were...
you're the prankster.

37:44.241 --> 37:46.660
That was a long
time ago, OK?

37:46.744 --> 37:48.871
I have changed.
I am an adult, OK?

37:48.954 --> 37:50.998
That's not me anymore.
I don't do that.

37:51.207 --> 37:53.417
Didn't you tell me
about a time that Val

37:53.501 --> 37:56.378
had, like, an FBI agent come
to your college or something?

37:56.670 --> 37:59.965
Oh, my God!
Yes, I almost forgot about that.

38:00.132 --> 38:01.842
Wait. An FBI agent?

38:02.551 --> 38:04.887
- CIA, technically.
- Oh, technically!

38:04.970 --> 38:05.971
Yes, yes.

38:06.055 --> 38:07.556
So this guy
comes to class

38:07.640 --> 38:09.642
all official, like,
badge and everything.

38:09.725 --> 38:11.310
Yeah.
He says Val needs to help

38:11.394 --> 38:12.853
with some secret
government project.

38:12.937 --> 38:14.647
Yeah, he needs to take him
away immediately

38:14.730 --> 38:16.899
and he needs to finish
his test at a later date.

38:17.149 --> 38:18.692
There's no way that worked.

38:18.776 --> 38:20.486
Mmm. It worked.

38:20.694 --> 38:22.446
You know that might be
the only prank of yours

38:22.530 --> 38:24.031
that wasn't, like,
mean-spirited.

38:24.115 --> 38:25.783
Do you think
of yourself as a sociopath

38:25.866 --> 38:26.784
or psychopath?

38:26.867 --> 38:28.911
Are you kidding me?
Look, I didn't do anything

38:28.994 --> 38:31.414
that's mean-spirited.
That was a joke.

38:32.206 --> 38:33.666
- It's a joke.
- Val.

38:33.749 --> 38:36.627
You can't just like revisionist
history this whole thing.

38:36.710 --> 38:37.878
I was there, OK?

38:37.962 --> 38:40.548
I got PTSD from all the shit
you pulled.

38:40.714 --> 38:41.674
OK.

38:41.757 --> 38:43.634
She's exaggerating, OK?
It was not that bad.

38:43.718 --> 38:45.636
- No. I'm not exaggerating.
- It's not a big deal.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.513
Well, I'm not a fan of pranks.

38:47.596 --> 38:48.764
I think they're sadistic.

38:50.099 --> 38:51.851
Alright.
I'm gonna put some tunes on.

38:51.934 --> 38:55.062
Take this party in a less
introspective direction, OK?

38:56.397 --> 38:58.607
Can't wait to see
what kinda music he puts on.

38:58.691 --> 38:59.692
Hey, guys.

38:59.775 --> 39:00.901
He has worse taste in music

39:00.985 --> 39:02.570
than the jet
from the movie <i>Stealth.</i>

39:06.115 --> 39:08.367
<i>My friend,
we cannot keep this a secret</i>

39:08.451 --> 39:09.660
<i>any longer...</i>

39:11.036 --> 39:12.496
- Val?
- I think so.

39:12.955 --> 39:14.415
- Karen?
- I don't know.

39:14.540 --> 39:16.167
Well, maybe you should
go outside

39:16.250 --> 39:18.127
and bum a cigarette from her.

39:18.335 --> 39:19.336
I don't smoke.

39:19.712 --> 39:21.130
Desperate times, honey.

39:21.922 --> 39:23.174
Maybe you should smoke.

39:23.799 --> 39:25.134
I don't wanna smoke.

39:25.509 --> 39:27.219
- OK, I'll smoke.
- OK. Good.

39:27.303 --> 39:29.472
But just be smooth.

39:29.764 --> 39:30.765
Duh.

39:38.147 --> 39:39.857
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:39.982 --> 39:41.150
You got an extra?

39:41.901 --> 39:43.069
Since when do you smoke?

39:43.569 --> 39:44.945
Since all the time.

39:46.072 --> 39:47.198
OK.

40:05.049 --> 40:06.717
I just want you to know
there's no...

40:07.551 --> 40:09.637
hard feelings
about what was said at dinner.

40:09.804 --> 40:11.138
Oh, you mean the other night?

40:12.515 --> 40:13.724
That's awfully big of you.

40:16.227 --> 40:17.645
It's your fault, you know.

40:18.270 --> 40:19.438
What is?

40:21.065 --> 40:23.150
Things don't have to be
awkward between us.

40:23.234 --> 40:24.443
It's not awkward.

40:24.819 --> 40:26.862
We haven't had a real
conversation since Thanksgiving.

40:29.281 --> 40:30.741
She never would've known.

40:35.454 --> 40:36.831
You had to be so noble,
didn't you?

40:36.956 --> 40:38.082
I would never do that to her.

40:38.207 --> 40:40.334
- But you've done it before.
- We dated for a week

40:40.418 --> 40:42.336
when we were in our 20s.
I hadn't even met Janet.

40:42.420 --> 40:44.880
- But we had sex, didn't we?
- What's your point?

40:45.089 --> 40:46.966
My point is exes hook up
all the time.

40:47.091 --> 40:48.801
It doesn't even really count
as an affair.

40:48.884 --> 40:50.428
It does in my book.

40:51.011 --> 40:52.930
Your book is fucking stupid.

40:59.645 --> 41:01.397
Don't you ever want
something different?

41:02.273 --> 41:05.317
Don't you ever get sick
of the same pussy?

41:07.361 --> 41:08.904
You're talking about my wife.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.615
- This is not appropriate.
- Fuck appropriate.

41:12.533 --> 41:13.951
Tell me the truth.

41:14.368 --> 41:16.120
Do you really still enjoy
having sex with her?

41:16.203 --> 41:17.663
- Of course.
- How?

41:19.874 --> 41:21.250
Because she's my favourite.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.006
Barf.

42:04.043 --> 42:05.336
Look, you got stuff going on

42:05.419 --> 42:06.962
I've got stuff going on.
I got a bunch...

42:07.004 --> 42:08.380
Do you?
Do you have stuff going on?

42:08.422 --> 42:10.633
- Got a bunch of stuff I'm...
- What are you working on?

42:10.758 --> 42:12.343
It's...
Let me know if it sucks

42:12.426 --> 42:13.886
but, like, a restaurant for cats

42:13.969 --> 42:16.180
- right, and their owners.
- Right. Yeah.

42:16.263 --> 42:17.306
Purr-fect.

42:17.431 --> 42:18.891
Business seems to be good.

42:18.974 --> 42:21.560
Yeah, I mean, the expansion
was entirely Maude's idea

42:21.644 --> 42:23.396
so I can't really take
credit for that but...

42:23.479 --> 42:25.731
The restaurant with no name.

42:28.109 --> 42:29.193
And no menu.

42:30.194 --> 42:31.904
So, you... you and Richard?

42:32.321 --> 42:33.906
Seems like it's going good?

42:34.240 --> 42:36.158
No, my Richard is terrible.

42:36.242 --> 42:37.660
Oh, your fiancé Richard?

42:37.743 --> 42:39.537
Yeah, he is a terrible person.

42:39.620 --> 42:42.081
What about your relationship?
How's that going?

42:42.998 --> 42:43.916
Good.

42:43.999 --> 42:45.501
No, dude. Honestly...

42:45.584 --> 42:47.962
- that sounds like a great idea.
- Fight Club the Restaurant.

42:48.546 --> 42:50.464
First rule of Fight Club
the Restaurant?

42:51.173 --> 42:52.216
Make a reservation.

42:54.719 --> 42:55.845
You're not gonna get drunk

42:55.928 --> 42:57.638
and play your saxophone again,
are you?

42:58.931 --> 42:59.849
No.

43:54.028 --> 43:55.279
Oh, my God.

43:55.446 --> 43:56.822
What? What's wrong?

43:57.031 --> 44:00.159
This is Armageddon.
This is the end of all things.

44:00.701 --> 44:02.411
We are out of fucking booze.

44:03.162 --> 44:04.747
Oh, no.
That's not a big deal.

44:04.830 --> 44:06.832
- The fuck it isn't, Janet.
- No, it's just

44:06.916 --> 44:08.751
isn't there a store close by?

44:08.876 --> 44:10.586
Yes, but it's closing soon

44:10.669 --> 44:12.797
and none of us
are in any condition to drive.

44:15.049 --> 44:17.802
Well, I haven't had
anything to drink.

44:19.303 --> 44:20.429
You're shitting me.

44:20.638 --> 44:22.890
No, I could totally do
a quick booze run.

44:24.558 --> 44:25.559
Janet.

44:26.727 --> 44:28.020
You're a goddamn hero.

44:35.111 --> 44:36.487
Go with God, Janet.

44:37.988 --> 44:39.490
And bring back
all the booze.

44:41.033 --> 44:42.159
All of it.

44:53.838 --> 44:55.673
- Gretel?
- Yeah.

44:57.842 --> 45:00.845
Uh, I was just...
I'm gonna go on a booze run.

45:00.928 --> 45:02.138
Did you wanna come?

45:02.430 --> 45:04.390
Could I ride shotgun?

45:05.266 --> 45:06.392
Yeah, totally.

45:10.479 --> 45:11.689
Uh...

45:17.903 --> 45:19.029
You set?

45:22.241 --> 45:24.118
Hey, do you mind
if I ask a question?

45:25.077 --> 45:26.203
What's your deal?

45:26.328 --> 45:28.873
Oh, I ate a whole bag
of weed gummy bears.

45:28.956 --> 45:30.541
I'm extremely high.

45:31.167 --> 45:32.501
OK!

45:33.210 --> 45:34.253
That makes sense.

45:36.589 --> 45:38.257
What do you think?
You have a preference?

45:39.592 --> 45:41.635
- The duck one.
- Huh.

46:05.284 --> 46:07.745
<i>We operate on a higher level...</i>

46:08.496 --> 46:09.872
<i>of authority.</i>

46:15.211 --> 46:16.629
<i>We operate...</i>

46:17.421 --> 46:19.048
<i>on a higher level...</i>

46:19.465 --> 46:21.300
<i>...of authority.</i>

46:30.559 --> 46:31.644
Hey.

46:31.977 --> 46:33.562
- What are you doing?
- Oh!

46:34.021 --> 46:35.106
Uh...

46:36.315 --> 46:37.650
nothing.

46:40.945 --> 46:42.154
Everything's fine.

47:14.812 --> 47:16.397
Hey, is everything alright?

47:16.480 --> 47:17.940
- <i>I saw him.</i>
- Who?

47:18.315 --> 47:21.152
I saw the dead guy.
Our dead guy.

47:22.236 --> 47:24.071
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure as shit.

47:24.363 --> 47:25.990
And he wasn't dead?

47:26.073 --> 47:28.117
More like the exact opposite.

47:28.284 --> 47:29.827
- Where was this?
- At the store.

47:29.952 --> 47:31.787
- At the grocery store.
- Maybe it was just

47:31.871 --> 47:33.247
someone who looked like him.

47:33.330 --> 47:36.125
- It's $322.12.
- Hang on.

47:37.710 --> 47:39.503
- Here you go!
- <i>Gracias.</i>

47:40.713 --> 47:43.340
<i>Look, we buried
a guy in the woods.</i>

47:43.716 --> 47:45.509
Look, I am on your side.
I got your back.

47:45.676 --> 47:46.761
<i>You know that.</i>

47:47.261 --> 47:49.972
I'm just considering
the options.

47:54.602 --> 47:57.313
And if you say you saw

47:57.521 --> 48:00.524
a dead guy walking around
a grocery store

48:01.650 --> 48:05.154
<i>then you saw a dead guy
walking around a grocery store.</i>

48:05.488 --> 48:07.239
- <i>I believe you.</i>
- Thank you.

48:14.538 --> 48:15.915
I don't know,
maybe you're right.

48:15.998 --> 48:18.709
Maybe it is just stress.

48:55.371 --> 48:58.541
I just had what you could call
a confirmation.

48:59.250 --> 49:01.669
He's alive.
He's alive as fuck.

49:14.098 --> 49:15.766
Have you been here
the whole time?

49:16.809 --> 49:17.977
I have.

49:20.730 --> 49:23.065
- Do you know where Patricia is?
- Are you still talking to me?

49:27.486 --> 49:28.571
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:28.654 --> 49:30.030
- Have you seen Patricia?
- Why?

49:30.197 --> 49:32.158
I need to borrow her set of keys
for the house.

49:32.908 --> 49:34.326
Why do you need a set of keys?

49:34.869 --> 49:36.537
I accidentally
locked our door upstairs

49:36.620 --> 49:38.080
and I need to get something
from our room.

49:38.164 --> 49:39.540
Oh, well, I have an extra set.

49:39.623 --> 49:40.833
Oh, great.

49:41.083 --> 49:42.418
Can I borrow them?

49:47.423 --> 49:49.800
Door's not gonna unlock itself.

49:49.925 --> 49:51.510
What do you say,
you and I go upstairs

49:51.594 --> 49:53.220
- for a quick...
- Oh, great, OK.

49:54.013 --> 49:55.389
Make sure I get those back!

49:55.890 --> 49:57.266
What was that, honey?

49:57.600 --> 49:58.809
Nothing.
I wasn't talking to you.

50:08.110 --> 50:09.403
Fuck you, gun room.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.776
- Keys?
- Thanks.

50:48.901 --> 50:51.404
One of these days, we will fuck.

50:51.487 --> 50:52.405
Ah.

50:53.322 --> 50:54.448
Do you hear me?

51:26.647 --> 51:28.649
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Are you OK?

51:28.733 --> 51:31.110
- I was just worried about you.
- No. Everything's fine.

51:31.902 --> 51:33.821
- Take a deep breath.
- OK.

51:34.155 --> 51:35.448
I realised something.

51:35.740 --> 51:37.533
We've been doing this all wrong.

51:37.783 --> 51:39.326
But now I know
what we need to do.

51:39.869 --> 51:40.911
What?

51:40.995 --> 51:45.374
"When you try to avoid conflict,
you create conflict."

51:45.958 --> 51:47.251
- Who said that?
- I don't know.

51:47.334 --> 51:48.586
Bruce Lee, maybe?

51:48.711 --> 51:51.464
We've been trying to play it
cool and see who knows what

51:51.547 --> 51:53.257
but that's not
getting us anywhere.

51:53.841 --> 51:55.843
It's time for us to put
our dicks on the table.

52:00.890 --> 52:01.849
Hey!

52:02.558 --> 52:04.894
Which one of you
knows about this shit?

52:06.687 --> 52:07.897
My puzzle!

52:08.314 --> 52:09.607
Oh, sh... I'm sorry, man.

52:09.857 --> 52:12.026
I spent four hours on this thing
and you just...

52:12.526 --> 52:13.486
Fuck!

52:13.569 --> 52:14.612
Sorry, man.

52:17.073 --> 52:19.200
Does this briefcase
look familiar to anyone?

52:21.118 --> 52:22.203
Nope.

52:24.121 --> 52:25.289
No one?

52:25.623 --> 52:26.832
W-what's going on here?

52:26.957 --> 52:29.293
Oh, what?
Even Captain Prankdick

52:29.376 --> 52:30.503
over here is gonna pretend

52:30.586 --> 52:32.338
he's never seen
this briefcase before?

52:32.671 --> 52:34.173
Really? Prankdick?
Thank you.

52:34.256 --> 52:35.508
The hell is going on?

52:35.591 --> 52:36.967
Yeah, I think
we're missing some things

52:37.051 --> 52:39.178
- like, all the things.
- Mm-hmm.

52:39.553 --> 52:41.639
You're all really gonna act
like you have no idea

52:41.722 --> 52:42.890
what we're talking about?

52:44.767 --> 52:47.853
Uh, yeah.
Maybe because we really don't.

52:47.978 --> 52:49.980
Hey, here's a thought,
why don't you guys

52:50.064 --> 52:52.566
just stop being so goddamn vague
and explain yourselves?

52:55.236 --> 52:56.404
They don't know.

52:56.779 --> 53:00.032
Um, yeah. I would say
it's pretty fucking obvious

53:00.116 --> 53:01.784
we have no idea
what you're talking about.

53:01.867 --> 53:03.452
Do you wanna let us in?

53:04.370 --> 53:07.331
Well, I guess we better
tell them everything.

53:07.706 --> 53:09.500
Woohoo!
Story time!

53:09.583 --> 53:11.877
But I need a drink.
And I'm also so tired.

53:11.961 --> 53:13.629
Can we please sit down
in the living room?

53:29.270 --> 53:30.438
OK.

53:30.980 --> 53:33.899
Not fully sure why we needed
to see you act all of that out

53:33.983 --> 53:36.110
but I do think
we're all caught up.

53:36.235 --> 53:39.196
A-ha! I knew it!
No one is that happy naturally.

53:39.697 --> 53:42.491
Wait, you don't actually
believe this shit, do you?

53:42.658 --> 53:44.118
I think you guys
are full of shit.

53:44.201 --> 53:46.162
I mean, there's no way that
actually happened, right?

53:46.370 --> 53:48.372
- Come on!
- Come on, dude.

53:48.456 --> 53:50.124
Tom and Janet
are a lot of things

53:50.207 --> 53:51.709
no offense,
but they're not liars.

53:52.126 --> 53:53.419
I mean, if it happened

53:53.502 --> 53:56.255
that doesn't necessarily mean
that shit does anything.

53:56.547 --> 53:57.882
Anything could be
in those syringes.

53:57.965 --> 53:59.633
- It could be Ecto Cooler.
- Wait, you guys.

53:59.717 --> 54:01.927
You're focusing on
the wrong fucking thing here.

54:02.053 --> 54:03.554
They killed somebody.

54:03.679 --> 54:06.182
Well, I understand
how you would think that

54:06.265 --> 54:08.309
but he's not dead anymore

54:08.642 --> 54:12.563
so... I didn't really
kill anyone.

54:12.646 --> 54:14.648
Yeah, I'll be honest,
I'm feeling a little weird

54:14.732 --> 54:15.941
about the whole murder part too.

54:16.025 --> 54:17.318
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

54:17.568 --> 54:19.653
I don't know
if it's murder per se.

54:20.738 --> 54:22.406
I mean, look,
you got a weird dude

54:22.490 --> 54:24.325
he comes in your house
with, like, big needles

54:24.408 --> 54:25.618
that's a tough situation.

54:25.910 --> 54:28.204
I say it's more like
self-defense, you know?

54:28.704 --> 54:30.122
Maybe I would do the same thing.

54:31.082 --> 54:32.917
- I said "maybe."
- Alright.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.668
So, you have this briefcase

54:34.752 --> 54:36.670
with these syringes in it,
all day

54:36.796 --> 54:39.381
but you don't say anything
until now? Why?

54:40.591 --> 54:41.550
W...

54:43.177 --> 54:44.553
They thought you did it.

54:44.929 --> 54:46.722
What? No. Me?

54:46.889 --> 54:48.474
Yes!
Or somebody in this room

54:48.557 --> 54:50.684
- but most likely you.
- OK. Yeah, yeah.

54:50.768 --> 54:53.354
I, um, I sent a guy
to your house

54:53.437 --> 54:55.981
and made him give you,
like, some <i>Twilight Zone</i> speech

54:56.065 --> 54:57.942
about your sex life?
Guilty.

54:58.442 --> 55:01.278
Uh, yeah. That sounds exactly
like something you'd do, right?

55:02.029 --> 55:04.156
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

55:04.240 --> 55:05.825
- OK. Screw you, Patricia.
- Alright.

55:05.991 --> 55:07.743
Screw you, Captain Prankfuck.

55:08.077 --> 55:09.995
Well, it was Prankdick,
actually.

55:10.329 --> 55:12.915
Yes. That is much better.
Captain Prankdick!

55:13.040 --> 55:14.583
You think your friends
would do something

55:14.667 --> 55:15.793
that fucked up to you?

55:15.876 --> 55:19.422
It was made very clear
that you all have a problem

55:19.505 --> 55:21.507
with our marriage
and how we make you feel.

55:21.590 --> 55:23.175
I don't have a problem
with your marriage.

55:23.592 --> 55:25.469
Babe, I mean, don't lie.

55:25.636 --> 55:26.721
I'm not lying.

55:27.179 --> 55:29.306
We complain
about these people all the time.

55:29.473 --> 55:31.475
Yeah, everybody
talks shit about everybody.

55:31.559 --> 55:32.435
That's just life.

55:32.518 --> 55:34.979
That's just how it works
but wasn't I the only one

55:35.062 --> 55:37.440
who was upset
when you uninvited them?

55:37.815 --> 55:39.608
Yeah, OK.
Yes. That's true.

55:39.692 --> 55:40.693
See? There you go.

55:40.776 --> 55:43.320
Look. The question is,
what do we do now?

55:47.700 --> 55:48.784
OK, well...

55:49.493 --> 55:50.828
Like Donald said, I mean

55:50.911 --> 55:53.831
none of us actually know
what's in these things.

55:53.914 --> 55:55.166
Yeah.
Could be horse piss.

55:55.291 --> 55:56.792
Yeah,
it could be horse piss.

55:58.002 --> 55:59.336
I mean, how do we find out?

56:03.257 --> 56:04.925
Does anyone know a scientist?

56:08.763 --> 56:09.972
Oh, I do.

56:10.806 --> 56:11.849
You do?

56:22.985 --> 56:24.028
What do you want?

56:24.111 --> 56:25.946
<i>Jesus, Arthur,
what's with the hostility?</i>

56:26.030 --> 56:27.823
You guys seem to be
having a great time.

56:27.865 --> 56:30.076
<i>I told people not to post
pictures on social media.</i>

56:30.409 --> 56:32.203
I didn't want anyone
to feel left out.

56:32.286 --> 56:35.498
Oh, that's so great of you.
Thanks.

56:35.581 --> 56:36.582
<i>Alright. Relax.</i>

56:36.665 --> 56:38.501
<i>Listen,
it's a couple's trip, Arthur.</i>

56:38.584 --> 56:40.920
Oh, so I'm penalised
because my wife left me?

56:41.754 --> 56:43.380
You know what? Never mind.

56:43.464 --> 56:44.715
I was calling to invite you

56:44.799 --> 56:46.467
but if you're gonna have
an attitude about it...

56:46.550 --> 56:48.719
No. No, no, no. No.
I'm sorry.

56:48.969 --> 56:53.057
Um, I just got hurt feelings.
That's what happened.

56:53.224 --> 56:54.558
<i>So, I would love to come.</i>

56:54.725 --> 56:57.269
Alright. Wonderful.
I'll text you the details.

56:57.353 --> 56:59.355
Great. That means a lot.
Thank you.

56:59.438 --> 57:00.564
<i>Um, one more thing.</i>

57:01.732 --> 57:03.401
Do you have a microscope?

57:09.323 --> 57:10.616
Yeah, of course
I have a microscope.

57:10.908 --> 57:13.577
Alright. Arthur's too fucking
high to drive right now

57:13.661 --> 57:15.496
so he's gonna get up
really early in the morning

57:15.579 --> 57:16.956
and he's gonna be here
first thing.

57:17.206 --> 57:19.375
He's gonna bring his microscope
and after breakfast

57:19.458 --> 57:20.668
we're gonna look
in the syringes.

57:21.127 --> 57:24.755
Great. So, what do you say,
maybe we call it a night?

57:24.964 --> 57:26.340
Everybody get some sleep.

57:26.590 --> 57:27.925
You wanna get some sleep?

57:28.050 --> 57:31.429
There is a guy stalking you
who will not die.

57:31.887 --> 57:33.514
How are any of us
gonna get any sleep?

57:33.597 --> 57:35.891
Oh, chill out,
you friggin' baby.

57:36.100 --> 57:37.435
We're in the safest place
on Earth.

57:37.643 --> 57:39.353
This house is a fortress.

57:40.020 --> 57:43.399
Let me show you. There are
motion sensors outside.

57:43.482 --> 57:45.401
There are sensors
on all the doors.

57:45.526 --> 57:47.278
There are sensors
on the windows.

57:47.403 --> 57:49.280
<i>Alarm system activated.</i>

57:49.780 --> 57:51.198
No one
is getting in here tonight

57:51.282 --> 57:52.241
without us knowing about it.

57:52.450 --> 57:54.869
Yeah, well, I don't know
about all of you guys

57:54.994 --> 57:56.746
but I don't personally
feel comfortable

57:56.829 --> 57:59.415
sleeping in the same house
with a couple of murderers.

57:59.498 --> 58:02.126
Oh, fuck off, Carla.
Why would anyone murder you?

58:02.293 --> 58:04.086
Chill out, Patricia.
Alright, that's rude.

58:04.170 --> 58:05.171
Maybe I'm wrong.

58:05.254 --> 58:06.964
Maybe there are plenty
of reasons to murder you.

58:07.047 --> 58:09.717
If you're that worried about it,
lock your goddamn door, OK?

58:10.384 --> 58:12.386
Anybody else have any issues?

58:14.096 --> 58:16.515
Great. Then I'll see you all
tomorrow morning.

58:16.599 --> 58:17.975
Maybe Val
will make us breakfast.

58:18.476 --> 58:20.186
You can make
your special poached eggs.

58:20.269 --> 58:22.646
Actually, I don't like
to cook on vacation.

58:22.772 --> 58:24.815
- Oh, my God...
- What?

58:24.940 --> 58:25.983
For me...

58:55.679 --> 58:56.847
Are you OK?

58:58.599 --> 58:59.642
Yeah.

59:02.186 --> 59:04.397
I'm gonna go downstairs.
Do you want anything?

59:04.980 --> 59:07.149
Oh, would you get me
a glass of water?

59:18.828 --> 59:20.996
You know, it's all starting
to make sense now.

59:22.331 --> 59:24.417
All that romantic talk
and your morals

59:24.500 --> 59:26.210
it's all bullshit.

59:29.463 --> 59:31.674
- It's not bullshit.
- You're lying to yourself.

59:33.008 --> 59:35.803
You didn't turn me down
because she's your "favourite."

59:42.226 --> 59:43.477
Goodnight, Karen.

59:49.191 --> 59:50.526
Sweet dreams.

1:00:20.056 --> 1:00:21.432
We don't have to do this.

1:00:24.018 --> 1:00:25.227
What, have to?

1:00:26.604 --> 1:00:28.606
We don't have to
keep up appearances.

1:00:31.567 --> 1:00:32.610
Oh.

1:00:33.819 --> 1:00:34.987
OK.

1:00:55.508 --> 1:00:57.635
Uh, did you bring me that water?

1:00:58.677 --> 1:01:00.012
I forgot.

1:01:35.631 --> 1:01:37.258
Do you think anyone suspects us?

1:01:39.593 --> 1:01:41.053
No, I think we're in the clear.

1:01:42.430 --> 1:01:43.431
Right?

1:01:44.682 --> 1:01:45.891
Maybe.

1:02:53.167 --> 1:02:54.335
No.

1:03:08.099 --> 1:03:10.226
- Honey?
- Go back to bed, sweetie.

1:03:10.851 --> 1:03:12.895
OK, honey...

1:04:40.858 --> 1:04:43.027
- Why?
- I was curious.

1:04:44.570 --> 1:04:46.614
Why should we wait
to see what's in it?

1:04:47.406 --> 1:04:48.991
I'm not gonna cheat on my wife.

1:04:52.161 --> 1:04:53.537
Are you sure about that?

1:04:57.083 --> 1:04:58.626
Because I'm feeling
some interest.

1:06:06.527 --> 1:06:07.737
This is wrong.

1:07:57.179 --> 1:07:59.306
We don't have
to keep up appearances.

1:07:59.390 --> 1:08:00.516
Remember?

1:08:26.417 --> 1:08:28.543
- Hey, how'd you sleep?
- Not now, Karen.

1:08:32.047 --> 1:08:33.299
Sorry.

1:08:47.438 --> 1:08:49.355
That was not there yesterday.

1:08:59.283 --> 1:09:00.659
Do you know
how much sugar is in that?

1:09:00.784 --> 1:09:02.369
When is the scientist dude
getting here?

1:09:02.869 --> 1:09:04.371
- Patricia.
- We don't know.

1:09:04.497 --> 1:09:07.373
Patricia.
How did you find this house?

1:09:07.833 --> 1:09:10.293
On the internet. On Airbnb,
like everyone finds a house.

1:09:10.628 --> 1:09:12.296
Can I see
the confirmation email?

1:09:12.421 --> 1:09:14.799
- Dude, what is your problem?
- What's going on?

1:09:16.675 --> 1:09:17.885
Where did you take that?

1:09:17.967 --> 1:09:19.804
It's in the living room,
above the fireplace.

1:09:21.389 --> 1:09:23.391
- What?
- Where did you get this house?

1:09:24.391 --> 1:09:26.476
You wanna...
You wanna just tell them?

1:09:31.065 --> 1:09:31.982
Mmm.

1:09:35.610 --> 1:09:37.988
I was looking for a house

1:09:38.072 --> 1:09:39.657
for this weekend on the internet

1:09:39.782 --> 1:09:42.326
and this guy from work
saw what I was doing

1:09:42.409 --> 1:09:45.663
and he overheard that my husband
got laid off and he felt bad.

1:09:47.748 --> 1:09:49.208
Look,
I lost my job six weeks ago.

1:09:50.668 --> 1:09:51.794
We sold the Lexus.

1:09:51.877 --> 1:09:53.337
We haven't been able
to pay our mortgage

1:09:53.421 --> 1:09:55.714
now we're having what is
commonly referred to as

1:09:55.798 --> 1:09:56.966
money problems.

1:09:57.049 --> 1:09:59.468
He offered us his place.

1:09:59.593 --> 1:10:01.137
And I thought,
"What's the harm?"

1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:03.139
Like, this place is rad

1:10:03.222 --> 1:10:05.182
and you guys
all wanted to, like

1:10:05.266 --> 1:10:07.476
pay to have a good time
this weekend.

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:09.895
So what does it matter
where I got it from, y'know?

1:10:09.979 --> 1:10:11.272
You took our money though?

1:10:11.355 --> 1:10:13.399
Is this the guy?
Is this him?

1:10:13.691 --> 1:10:14.900
Yeah. So?

1:10:15.025 --> 1:10:16.694
He's the guy with the briefcase.

1:10:17.611 --> 1:10:18.904
We're in his fucking house.

1:10:19.572 --> 1:10:20.740
Oh, that's not good.

1:10:20.906 --> 1:10:23.617
Well, he's watching us, so...

1:10:23.701 --> 1:10:25.327
W-what do you mean watching us?

1:10:25.411 --> 1:10:27.079
I just... I know
he's got cameras.

1:10:27.955 --> 1:10:28.873
Where?

1:10:29.039 --> 1:10:31.876
There's definitely a good view
of that couch over there.

1:10:31.959 --> 1:10:32.877
Oh, shit.

1:10:34.879 --> 1:10:36.797
Hey, guys.
Just a quick question.

1:10:37.131 --> 1:10:39.008
Why the shit are we still here?

1:10:40.051 --> 1:10:41.093
Yeah, that's a good point.

1:10:41.177 --> 1:10:42.720
Let's discuss my fuck-up
at a later date.

1:10:42.887 --> 1:10:44.055
- Great!
- Yeah.

1:10:47.850 --> 1:10:50.061
- Hey, what about your stuff?
- Who cares?

1:10:50.144 --> 1:10:51.145
We'll buy new shit.

1:10:51.854 --> 1:10:53.647
- Maybe a little closer.
- How much closer?

1:10:53.814 --> 1:10:55.107
- Don't hit it.
- Of course not.

1:10:55.191 --> 1:10:56.233
I'm not trying to hit it.

1:10:56.317 --> 1:10:58.027
It's how close I have to be
for the sensor to work.

1:10:58.110 --> 1:10:59.737
It should be here,
like, the machine's...

1:10:59.779 --> 1:11:01.739
I'm underneath. I'm at
the gate. There's no...

1:11:01.822 --> 1:11:03.699
I can't go any further
without hitting the gate.

1:11:03.741 --> 1:11:05.659
- Just try to back up.
- Back up and move up to it?

1:11:05.785 --> 1:11:07.495
Didn't you feel
that there was just...

1:11:07.912 --> 1:11:09.163
I just got the distinct vibe

1:11:09.246 --> 1:11:11.499
there was gonna be some
weird sex game.

1:11:11.582 --> 1:11:13.584
If we stay in there
one more minute

1:11:13.667 --> 1:11:15.252
- we're seeing dicks.
- We're seeing dick.

1:11:17.129 --> 1:11:19.006
Why are they honking at us?

1:11:19.090 --> 1:11:20.800
We can't open the gate either!

1:11:20.883 --> 1:11:22.218
- Won't open!
- Guys.

1:11:22.301 --> 1:11:24.178
Gate's not working.

1:11:24.261 --> 1:11:26.263
- You gotta move forward!
- Gotta figure out the gate.

1:11:26.347 --> 1:11:28.432
We don't need to move forward

1:11:28.516 --> 1:11:30.142
- or back...
- There's a censor!

1:11:30.226 --> 1:11:31.227
I know that, Pat!

1:11:31.310 --> 1:11:32.812
I want you
to move your car back

1:11:32.895 --> 1:11:34.313
so I can move my car forward.

1:11:34.438 --> 1:11:35.856
You have to go forward

1:11:35.940 --> 1:11:37.817
- not backward.
- Is there a garage door opener

1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:39.068
in the garage we could use?

1:11:39.151 --> 1:11:40.444
That would open
the garage, dummy.

1:11:40.528 --> 1:11:41.821
- Ugh.
- I'm gonna try to reset it.

1:11:41.862 --> 1:11:42.863
Babe, don't touch it.

1:11:42.947 --> 1:11:44.240
- Ladies, ladies, ladies.
- Can you not...

1:11:44.281 --> 1:11:45.783
Ladies, ladies,
ladies, ladies...

1:11:45.908 --> 1:11:47.326
Gentleman, gentleman, gentleman!

1:11:47.410 --> 1:11:49.995
Look, sorry.
I'm gonna hop this bitch.

1:11:50.204 --> 1:11:52.248
Hey! Remember our conversation.

1:11:52.331 --> 1:11:54.208
You're not allowed
to use that word anymore.

1:11:54.291 --> 1:11:56.293
It's a special consideration
for the situation.

1:12:02.216 --> 1:12:03.551
Is he breathing?

1:12:06.762 --> 1:12:07.972
You OK?

1:12:10.683 --> 1:12:13.060
Let's go. Let's go.
OK, let's go.

1:12:14.395 --> 1:12:15.813
OK. Let's move out.

1:12:15.896 --> 1:12:16.897
Guys.

1:12:16.939 --> 1:12:18.524
- We're not getting out of here.
- What?

1:12:18.607 --> 1:12:20.484
- Why isn't the gate open?
- I...

1:12:20.568 --> 1:12:22.778
- What the hell happened?
- The gate's electrified.

1:12:22.862 --> 1:12:24.363
- What?
- Is Don-Don OK?

1:12:24.530 --> 1:12:26.532
- Who the fuck is Don-Don?
- Oh, fuck.

1:12:26.615 --> 1:12:28.743
I forgot I was giving everyone
nicknames for the weekend.

1:12:28.826 --> 1:12:30.494
I feel like I put my dick
in a socket.

1:12:34.081 --> 1:12:35.875
- Everyone, stay calm.
- Whoa, whoa.

1:12:36.041 --> 1:12:37.877
- You have a gun?
- It's not mine.

1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:39.044
Then whose is it?

1:12:39.128 --> 1:12:40.463
I got it from the gun room.

1:12:40.546 --> 1:12:41.797
There's a gun room?

1:12:41.881 --> 1:12:42.798
Yeah.

1:12:42.882 --> 1:12:45.217
There's a gun room
and an electrified fence?

1:12:45.301 --> 1:12:47.094
Patricia,
what a great vacation spot!

1:12:47.178 --> 1:12:48.929
Well done. Zero stars.

1:12:49.013 --> 1:12:50.473
OK. I made a mistake.

1:12:50.556 --> 1:12:52.224
Get off my dick. Jesus.

1:12:53.350 --> 1:12:54.977
I think we should
go back inside.

1:12:55.186 --> 1:12:57.480
Uh, yeah.
That's not happening. So...

1:13:07.656 --> 1:13:09.533
Jesus,
why would you have this?

1:13:09.784 --> 1:13:11.619
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

1:13:11.702 --> 1:13:13.287
Does anybody have a better idea?

1:13:15.164 --> 1:13:16.290
OK.

1:13:27.051 --> 1:13:28.969
Where the fuck
is all the furniture?

1:14:57.308 --> 1:14:58.267
Where's Gretel?

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:03.606
<i>The hell you been?</i>

1:15:03.689 --> 1:15:05.441
<i>The bathroom, jeez.
Hold your horses.</i>

1:15:10.112 --> 1:15:12.364
You had everybody waiting,
and it's rude.

1:15:16.410 --> 1:15:17.578
Now what?

1:15:21.707 --> 1:15:24.043
<i>You are all going to have a talk</i>

1:15:24.919 --> 1:15:27.838
<i>and then this will all be over.</i>

1:15:29.507 --> 1:15:30.549
A...

1:15:31.342 --> 1:15:32.635
a talk?

1:15:34.095 --> 1:15:37.139
Wait. We just have to talk?

1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:40.684
Yeah? Like, no weird sex shit?

1:15:41.519 --> 1:15:45.064
<i>There will be
no weird sex stuff, just a chat.</i>

1:15:46.232 --> 1:15:47.400
Well, that's good.

1:15:47.525 --> 1:15:51.070
<i>It's time for everyone
to be honest with each other.</i>

1:15:55.157 --> 1:15:56.325
I'm not going first.

1:15:56.909 --> 1:15:59.703
I feel like everybody knows
I'm broke now, so...

1:16:00.079 --> 1:16:01.914
Yeah, we don't have
any other secrets.

1:16:05.709 --> 1:16:08.129
Do you have anything
you'd like to share, Tom?

1:16:11.590 --> 1:16:12.758
Karen, how about you?

1:16:15.219 --> 1:16:16.387
Can't think of anything.

1:16:17.179 --> 1:16:19.014
Karen fucked my husband
last night.

1:16:20.391 --> 1:16:21.267
Ooh.

1:16:22.309 --> 1:16:23.227
OK.

1:16:23.769 --> 1:16:25.563
Well, at least
you're not denying it.

1:16:27.982 --> 1:16:29.066
That's not true.

1:16:33.904 --> 1:16:35.114
It's fucking true?

1:16:38.242 --> 1:16:39.869
She injected me in my sleep.

1:16:42.371 --> 1:16:43.706
What, with the horse piss?

1:16:51.881 --> 1:16:54.341
OK, I had sex
with Tom last night.

1:16:55.342 --> 1:16:56.677
Fuck it. I'll admit it, but...

1:16:57.136 --> 1:16:59.513
just to clarify, I didn't
inject you with anything.

1:17:01.057 --> 1:17:02.308
What?

1:17:03.851 --> 1:17:05.019
Who else would've done it?

1:17:05.102 --> 1:17:06.353
You have keys
to the whole house.

1:17:06.729 --> 1:17:09.356
Well, I also have a set of keys,
but I didn't touch your butt.

1:17:11.067 --> 1:17:14.111
I stabbed you in the butt
with a syringe

1:17:14.195 --> 1:17:16.739
but I didn't inject you
with that weird shit.

1:17:16.822 --> 1:17:18.282
Alright? I'm not...
I'm not evil.

1:17:25.998 --> 1:17:27.625
So, you stabbed him in the butt?

1:17:28.167 --> 1:17:30.336
And then you just took it out
and put it away?

1:17:33.339 --> 1:17:34.423
Hey, w...

1:17:36.467 --> 1:17:37.802
I would never.

1:17:37.885 --> 1:17:39.136
But you would.

1:17:39.261 --> 1:17:41.430
Clearly, because you did.

1:17:45.893 --> 1:17:46.852
How did you know?

1:17:47.103 --> 1:17:48.938
Oh, I watched the whole thing.

1:17:52.608 --> 1:17:53.984
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.

1:17:54.068 --> 1:17:55.069
Oh, fuck off, Val.

1:17:55.152 --> 1:17:56.570
"Fuck off"? Excuse me, alright?

1:17:56.654 --> 1:17:58.030
You're gay.

1:18:00.241 --> 1:18:01.992
I'm not gay.

1:18:02.451 --> 1:18:04.328
Oh, you're not?
You're not gay?

1:18:04.578 --> 1:18:06.163
Then why have you been
fucking your sous chef

1:18:06.247 --> 1:18:07.498
for the past three years?

1:18:09.291 --> 1:18:10.709
You thought no one knew?

1:18:11.794 --> 1:18:14.296
Who else here knew about Val
and his sous chef escapades?

1:18:18.426 --> 1:18:19.969
You're a bunch
of fucking assholes.

1:18:20.302 --> 1:18:22.763
- And for the record, I'm bi.
- Oh.

1:18:23.431 --> 1:18:25.433
Sexuality's complicated, man.

1:18:26.142 --> 1:18:27.226
Is it?

1:18:27.518 --> 1:18:30.563
And Patricia,
when the group decided

1:18:30.646 --> 1:18:31.981
to un-invite us
from the weekend

1:18:32.064 --> 1:18:35.234
you said you had our backs
and you voted against it.

1:18:35.317 --> 1:18:36.986
- Is that right?
- Yup.

1:18:37.820 --> 1:18:40.030
Yeah, that's right.
Because...

1:18:40.698 --> 1:18:43.117
I like you guys
and you are my friends.

1:18:44.118 --> 1:18:45.703
It was just for the money,
wasn't it?

1:18:46.662 --> 1:18:47.788
Yes.

1:18:50.833 --> 1:18:54.837
Jesus. So, everyone in this room
is just a liar, yeah?

1:18:56.714 --> 1:18:58.048
I fucked Karen.

1:18:59.008 --> 1:19:00.051
Oh, my God.

1:19:00.718 --> 1:19:02.261
Karen, you fucked my wife?

1:19:03.220 --> 1:19:04.221
A little.

1:19:05.514 --> 1:19:06.515
When did this happen?

1:19:06.849 --> 1:19:08.976
Thanksgiving. What is it?
Fucking...

1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:10.686
Fuck.

1:19:10.770 --> 1:19:13.689
Karen, you fucked my wife
on fucking Thanksgiving?

1:19:13.773 --> 1:19:15.066
It was Tom's fault.

1:19:15.441 --> 1:19:16.776
How the fuck was it Tom's fault?

1:19:16.901 --> 1:19:18.402
I tried to get him
to have an affair with me.

1:19:18.611 --> 1:19:19.820
I tried. I tried.

1:19:19.904 --> 1:19:21.238
I fucking tried
but he wouldn't do it.

1:19:21.363 --> 1:19:22.948
Oh, great.
So, I was second choice?

1:19:23.074 --> 1:19:24.992
We do not have to get
into that right now.

1:19:25.159 --> 1:19:26.744
You're the fucking worst.

1:19:27.244 --> 1:19:28.287
Agreed.

1:19:35.461 --> 1:19:37.630
Well, there's one couple
we haven't heard from yet.

1:19:40.841 --> 1:19:42.551
Well, I know why we're here.

1:19:47.598 --> 1:19:49.892
Your friend is an abusive

1:19:50.267 --> 1:19:52.144
violent piece of shit.

1:19:55.064 --> 1:19:57.650
And there's more but you can
use your imagination.

1:20:00.903 --> 1:20:03.406
I made some mistakes, OK?

1:20:03.489 --> 1:20:04.740
I'm trying to deal with it.

1:20:04.824 --> 1:20:05.825
Shut the fuck up.

1:20:05.908 --> 1:20:08.536
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. OK?

1:20:17.711 --> 1:20:19.255
This is why we're here.

1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:22.133
It's not about
what's in those syringes.

1:20:23.134 --> 1:20:26.011
<i>We're, like, mice in a cage.</i>

1:20:27.430 --> 1:20:29.557
He wants to take away
all our hope

1:20:29.640 --> 1:20:31.058
and leave us with nothing.

1:20:43.988 --> 1:20:45.656
<i>Where are the cameras in here?</i>

1:20:46.907 --> 1:20:47.992
Uh...

1:20:48.325 --> 1:20:50.703
I don't know.
I assume they're everywhere.

1:20:58.127 --> 1:21:01.297
Uh, you wanted us to talk
and we talked.

1:21:04.675 --> 1:21:06.469
<i>I cheated on my wife.</i>

1:21:09.889 --> 1:21:11.348
<i>Everyone's an asshole.</i>

1:21:13.100 --> 1:21:14.351
Patricia's a liar.

1:21:14.894 --> 1:21:16.145
Richard's a monster.

1:21:19.982 --> 1:21:21.650
<i>I think we've talked enough.</i>

1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:37.708
<i>You are done.</i>

1:21:38.084 --> 1:21:39.835
<i>You may all go home now.</i>

1:21:45.925 --> 1:21:47.385
<i>Drive safe.</i>

1:23:53.761 --> 1:23:55.638
I'd say that went pretty well.

1:23:55.805 --> 1:23:56.889
What the fuck?

1:23:56.972 --> 1:23:58.849
You guys did it in record time.

1:23:58.933 --> 1:24:00.434
- When I first started...
- Oh, what now?

1:24:00.518 --> 1:24:02.853
Are you gonna give us
an explanation for all this?

1:24:03.312 --> 1:24:04.271
Well, don't bother.

1:24:04.772 --> 1:24:05.940
Because I don't care.

1:24:06.148 --> 1:24:07.525
I don't care who you are.

1:24:07.608 --> 1:24:09.443
I don't care
if you're the devil.

1:24:09.527 --> 1:24:11.153
I don't care if you're an angel.

1:24:11.237 --> 1:24:13.531
I don't care
if you're from the future.

1:24:14.907 --> 1:24:17.868
It doesn't matter who you are
or what you're trying to do

1:24:18.119 --> 1:24:20.871
cos as far as I'm concerned,
you're just an asshole.

1:24:21.580 --> 1:24:23.624
And you can go fuck yourself.

1:24:26.752 --> 1:24:28.170
Let's go home.

1:24:39.014 --> 1:24:40.307
I'd shoot you in the face

1:24:40.391 --> 1:24:42.351
but it won't do much
of anything, will it?

1:24:43.018 --> 1:24:44.061
I'm afraid not.

1:24:44.812 --> 1:24:47.189
Feel free to cash the cheque
I gave you.

1:24:48.149 --> 1:24:49.483
It won't bounce.

1:25:32.610 --> 1:25:34.779
Hey! 14 years of marriage.

1:25:36.072 --> 1:25:37.740
Yeah. That's us.

1:25:38.199 --> 1:25:40.242
So, uh, where...
where's the party?

1:25:42.369 --> 1:25:43.704
The party's over.

1:25:45.247 --> 1:25:46.749
But I just got here though.

1:25:48.542 --> 1:25:50.419
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

1:25:51.128 --> 1:25:52.213
Shit happens.

1:25:54.381 --> 1:25:55.424
Great.

1:26:29.417 --> 1:26:30.793
Pull over. I gotta take a piss.

1:27:37.902 --> 1:27:39.320
Did you just kill Richard?

1:27:39.862 --> 1:27:40.905
Yeah.

1:27:42.531 --> 1:27:43.699
OK.

1:27:44.992 --> 1:27:46.827
Hey, have you met
our friend Arthur?

1:27:47.745 --> 1:27:48.913
I don't think so.

1:27:49.038 --> 1:27:50.915
Oh, he's a super nice guy.

1:27:51.373 --> 1:27:53.959
- Yeah, I think you'd like him.
- Oh, yeah?

1:27:58.255 --> 1:27:59.757
I can't wait to see the kids.

1:28:03.594 --> 1:28:04.762
Neither can I.

1:28:10.726 --> 1:28:11.852
I love you.

1:28:13.729 --> 1:28:14.897
Hey, it wasn't all bad.

1:28:15.648 --> 1:28:17.066
At least we got to keep
the money.

1:28:19.193 --> 1:28:20.528
I think we earned it.

1:28:22.363 --> 1:28:24.657
Hey, I talked to Maude
about a job at her company.

1:28:26.700 --> 1:28:27.743
You did?

1:29:54.622 --> 1:29:55.790
Hey.

1:29:57.750 --> 1:30:00.461
We need new friends.

1:31:25.796 --> 1:31:27.506
I'm not an alcoholic.

1:31:29.133 --> 1:31:30.301
Hello?

1:31:30.384 --> 1:31:31.927
Do you have your own home?

1:31:49.945 --> 1:31:51.363
I really like this puzzle.

1:35:26.328 --> 1:35:27.872
<i>Oh, Francesca.</i>

1:35:27.997 --> 1:35:29.623
<i>Reynaldo, my love.</i>

1:35:29.707 --> 1:35:31.125
<i>Who would've
thought we'd have</i>

1:35:31.208 --> 1:35:32.334
<i>such a happy ending?</i>

1:35:32.418 --> 1:35:33.878
<i>No one, my dear.</i>

1:35:34.086 --> 1:35:35.379
<i>No one but me.</i>
