00:17.884 --> 00:20.079
Come on. Vogue with me, baby.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.589
Look, Geoffrey. We're voguing.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.125
And what is the precise nature
of this nervous disorder?

00:31.564 --> 00:35.591
It's for people that want to look cool
but ain't really got no rhythm.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.398
You should be good at it.
Come on, strike the pose.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.899
Unhand me, you ruffian.

00:42.509 --> 00:46.969
Will, please. Don't you have anything
better to do than to annoy Geoffrey?

00:47.180 --> 00:49.205
Yeah, but Carlton ain't home yet.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.046
That's right.

00:52.118 --> 00:54.348
Do you have any idea
what he does after school?

00:54.421 --> 00:56.946
Window-shop at Randy's Short and Small?

00:58.958 --> 01:01.893
Carlton belongs
to three different after-school clubs.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.788
I belong to the home shopping club.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.193
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, love.

01:07.267 --> 01:10.327
- How was your day?
- Fine, until I ran into the man of leisure.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.338
Will doesn't think he needs
any after-school activities.

01:13.406 --> 01:17.843
If you sit around the house all afternoon
and never develop any outside interests...

01:17.911 --> 01:20.573
you'll become a very, very shallow person.

01:22.015 --> 01:25.212
And you won't get into any
of the good nightclubs.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.982
I'll never meet Lisa Bonet.

01:29.622 --> 01:30.850
That's right.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.861
You have so many talents.
Why not join an after-school club?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.829
Aunt Viv, I ain't really down...

01:37.897 --> 01:40.957
with staying at an
all-boys school after dark.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.770
All right, then.
I think you should get an after-school job.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.040
Bring on the clubs.

03:08.421 --> 03:12.858
It's officially after school.
Go find the club of your choice.

03:13.593 --> 03:18.462
If I had the club of my choice,
you'd be lying on the floor unconscious.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.225
A girl?

03:22.302 --> 03:24.327
Where did that come from?

03:24.537 --> 03:25.561
Didn't you know?

03:25.638 --> 03:29.768
We share our extra-curricular activities
with the girls from our sister school.

03:29.842 --> 03:34.108
Lead me to the sisters.
I'm ready to get extracurricular.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.505
Yo, Will. Slap me 10.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.970
<i>You know, I finally rented
the movie Glory last night.</i>

04:04.043 --> 04:06.603
Denzel was incredible.

04:07.113 --> 04:11.311
The South, man. I don't know.
We got to do something about it.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.317
- What's up, Mr. Fellows?
- Call me Ned.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.447
You need another member
of this poetry club?

04:19.524 --> 04:21.618
Will, solid.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.926
We could really use...

04:23.997 --> 04:26.898
a representative
of the Black male urban experience.

04:27.467 --> 04:31.426
More specifically, the handsome
Black male urban experience.

04:31.504 --> 04:35.463
Everyone, the meeting's about to begin.
Will you please take your seats?

04:37.710 --> 04:39.075
I'd like to open this meeting...

04:39.145 --> 04:42.546
<i>with a reading from the poem Daddy
by Sylvia Plath.</i>

04:43.483 --> 04:44.575
<i>Daddy.</i>

04:44.651 --> 04:47.279
"Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You

04:47.520 --> 04:49.488
"Every woman adores a Fascist

04:49.756 --> 04:51.121
"The boot in the face, the brute

04:51.190 --> 04:54.057
"Brute heart of a brute like you"

04:56.462 --> 04:59.727
Sylvia Plath killed herself
shortly after writing this poem.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.359
If she didn't, her daddy would have.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.334
Who are you?

05:05.171 --> 05:09.733
This is my main man Will Smith,
newest member of our poetry club.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.501
Will, Christina Johnson.
And we are so glad to have you.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.241
It's such a thrill to see a man
from Bel-Air Academy...

05:16.316 --> 05:19.217
not afraid to share our love of poetry.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.886
Thanks, Christina.
Yo, on with the love sharing.

05:23.956 --> 05:26.322
You can start by reading a poem for us.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.928
- I didn't bring one.
- What a shame.

05:30.029 --> 05:33.089
There's nothing that moves me
more than hearing a poem recited...

05:33.166 --> 05:37.193
in a deep, sensual, masculine voice.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.993
I got a poem.

05:42.542 --> 05:46.000
- Who's it by?
- He's a street poet.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.910
He's a friend of mine. His name is...

05:49.849 --> 05:53.512
Raphael de la Ghetto.

05:55.321 --> 05:58.722
Raphael de la Ghetto.
I don't think I've ever heard of him.

05:58.791 --> 05:59.985
I have.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.555
You have?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.465
I stay pretty current, bro.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.765
Isn't he one of those street poets
from south central LA?

06:10.903 --> 06:12.962
Yeah. Same guy.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.635
Will, the floor's yours.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.609
Floor's yours.
You're a poet and you don't know it.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.605
I am a poet and I do know it.

06:22.915 --> 06:25.076
Why don't you recite your poem?

06:26.886 --> 06:30.822
All right. Ladies, my poem is called...

06:35.595 --> 06:37.222
<i>Tick Tock Clock...</i>

06:38.531 --> 06:40.226
by Raphael de la Ghetto.

06:42.869 --> 06:45.463
"Tick tock clock

06:46.773 --> 06:49.241
"The clock is ticking for you

06:51.911 --> 06:54.175
"'Cause the love you said you'd give

06:54.247 --> 06:56.613
"Came up way past due

07:03.089 --> 07:05.216
"So dance to the clock rock

07:06.492 --> 07:08.960
"Stay on the floor

07:09.095 --> 07:12.087
"'Cause when the ticks turn to tocks

07:14.200 --> 07:16.464
"I'll be knocking at your door"

07:26.212 --> 07:28.407
That was incredible.

07:28.481 --> 07:30.847
And very typical of de la Ghetto's work.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.684
Listen, everybody, let's take a break
while I go fire up the cappuccino maker.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.258
That poem was brilliant.

07:39.325 --> 07:42.123
De la Ghetto uses a lot of metaphor.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.696
No, baby, he used to. He went
to the clinic. He's straight now.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.169
I'd love to hear more
of de la Ghetto's poems.

07:50.269 --> 07:54.831
As a woman, I find his work
so passionate, so raw...

07:54.974 --> 07:56.669
so exciting.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.370
When I hear those words
my body just quivers...

07:59.445 --> 08:01.913
crying out for more.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.143
Poetry is good.

08:11.924 --> 08:14.552
<i>"Love by Raphael de la Ghetto."</i>

08:18.731 --> 08:22.724
<i>"Burnin' Love by Raphael de la Ghetto."</i>

08:24.203 --> 08:28.037
Master William,
Mr. Jazz is here to see you.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.910
Yo, what up, J?

08:33.578 --> 08:36.548
What's up, man,
I got this new Ice Cube tape. It's dope!

08:36.682 --> 08:40.482
I ain't got enough time for that.
I got to finish writing this poem.

08:41.486 --> 08:45.947
Poem? Then what you going to do,
bake some cookies?

08:46.325 --> 08:47.724
Hem a dress?

08:48.494 --> 08:52.294
Shut up. I'm doing it to get this girl.

08:52.365 --> 08:56.233
Listen to what I got so far.
I just need one last line.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.871
"My love for you is like a river

09:02.241 --> 09:05.802
"Like a summer breeze
That makes my soul shiver

09:06.846 --> 09:10.441
"One look from you
Is more precious than gold"

09:11.851 --> 09:14.285
Let's go get some barbecue and get busy.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.984
What kind of line is that?

09:18.090 --> 09:19.614
It always works for me.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.958
I hear someone in this room likes poetry.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.157
Try this one on for size.

09:26.465 --> 09:28.831
"Roses are red
Violets are blue

09:28.901 --> 09:31.597
"Pansies are poets
Will, tell me it isn't true"

09:32.405 --> 09:33.429
That's funny.

09:33.506 --> 09:36.441
I got a poem for you, Carl.
Try this one on for size.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.170
"Roses are red
Violets are blue

09:39.245 --> 09:41.941
"Jazz and I are Black,
But Carlton, what are you?"

09:50.990 --> 09:52.548
Master William...

09:53.859 --> 09:56.191
I applaud your new interest.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.129
Poetry is one of my great loves.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.495
I won first prize...

10:00.566 --> 10:04.024
at the old Devonshire
poetry recital of 1963.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.538
You should have been there.

10:06.739 --> 10:10.505
The crowd rose to its feet
shouting, "Encore!"

10:11.544 --> 10:12.568
That's interesting...

10:12.645 --> 10:14.636
"Cannon to the right of them

10:14.714 --> 10:16.739
"Cannon to the left of them

10:16.816 --> 10:18.943
"Cannon in front of them

10:19.018 --> 10:21.987
"Volleyed and thundered"

10:22.054 --> 10:23.954
You need a last line for that?

10:25.524 --> 10:27.822
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

10:28.027 --> 10:30.928
So, young man,
how'd it go at school today?

10:31.230 --> 10:33.858
- I joined the poetry club.
- Excellent.

10:34.066 --> 10:36.864
I remember
when I got interested in poetry.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.494
So who's the girl?

10:39.605 --> 10:41.800
I'm starving. When do we eat here?

10:41.874 --> 10:43.466
We eat here later.

10:43.542 --> 10:45.032
You eat here never.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.777
Looks like you eat here often.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.997
Hi, Will. Where's your uncle?

11:06.065 --> 11:08.795
He's throwing Jazz out the house again.

11:09.735 --> 11:13.398
Okay. Here are those poetry books
you wanted.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.997
I used them in the Freshman Lit class
I taught last year.

11:16.075 --> 11:19.169
If you have any questions about poetry,
just ask me.

11:19.245 --> 11:20.940
Yeah, I have a question.

11:21.147 --> 11:24.947
I understand why guys get into poetry.
To get girls.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.349
But why do girls like poetry?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.752
Because girls think with their brains.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.250
Miss Christina Johnson.

11:37.096 --> 11:40.327
This is my Aunt Viv
and this is my cousin Ashley.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.390
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.732
You'll have to excuse us.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.600
Will, I've got a poem.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.207
- "Will and Christina sitting in a tree..."
- Beat it.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.411
They seem really nice.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.580
Yeah. They mean well.

11:57.850 --> 12:01.308
But the only people
I'm really comfortable with are my friends.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.377
The dead poets.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.123
- Care to sit?
- Thanks.

12:09.095 --> 12:12.462
You know, I can't get de la Ghetto's poem
off my mind.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.527
He is a genius, isn't he?

12:15.668 --> 12:17.932
Do you really, really know him?

12:18.971 --> 12:20.905
Yeah. We're like brothers.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.833
Tell me. What's he like?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.636
He's a kind of a strange guy.

12:26.712 --> 12:30.739
His girl left him back in the '60s
and he never changed his clothes.

12:30.916 --> 12:34.352
Wears the same old dashiki
and monster afro.

12:35.554 --> 12:39.422
- That's such a sad story.
- I know.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.460
When I think about poor Raphael...

12:42.628 --> 12:46.894
it makes me wonder if a woman
could ever really care about a man.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.800
I'm glad you know him so well,
because I have a favor to ask you.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.036
Anything.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.375
Could you bring Raphael to poetry night?

13:01.447 --> 13:04.780
- Excuse me?
- We have it at school once a month.

13:04.850 --> 13:07.444
Usually club members get up
and recite their poetry.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.010
I'm in charge of it this month...

13:09.088 --> 13:12.216
and I thought, "Wouldn't it be great
if we had a real poet?"

13:12.992 --> 13:16.951
I don't know.
Raphael doesn't like to leave the house.

13:17.029 --> 13:20.362
You wouldn't either if you had
the same dashiki on for 20 years.

13:20.432 --> 13:23.868
Could you just ask him, Will?
I'd be so grateful.

13:24.470 --> 13:29.407
- I could ask him, but I'm sure he'll say no.
- Please try, Will.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.636
It would mean so much to me.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.625
Yo, he'll be there.

13:56.202 --> 13:59.330
- I'm glad you're here.
- You sounded kind of clutch on the phone.

13:59.438 --> 14:00.564
I'm in big trouble.

14:00.639 --> 14:04.075
I promised Christina
I'd have a famous poet at school tonight.

14:04.243 --> 14:07.440
I'm connected,
but I don't know any famous poets.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.981
I need somebody
to pretend to be a famous poet.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.051
I'll be home about 6:00, Geoffrey.

14:13.118 --> 14:16.849
Is that your uncle?
I'm tired of those grass burns.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.690
- Good morning, Will.
- Good morning.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.251
- Better get ready for school.
- Okay.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.427
We're really looking forward
to poetry night tonight.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.263
- How did you hear about it?
- Your teacher Mr. Fellows called.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.463
He's calling all the parents
of Bel-Air Academy.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.937
No, Aunt Viv.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.903
- You guys can't go.
- But I love poetry.

14:36.976 --> 14:40.343
Wait a minute, now, Vivian.
Let's be a little sensitive here.

14:40.412 --> 14:43.643
Will only joined the poetry club
because he had a crush on Christina.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.014
If we show up, we'll cramp his style.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.985
Okay. You're right.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.049
Will, good luck tonight.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.990
- Thanks for understanding.
- Are you kidding?

14:54.059 --> 14:57.460
I just didn't want to get stuck
at some boring poetry night.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.201
Is he gone yet?

15:03.936 --> 15:05.904
Did you hear any of that?

15:05.971 --> 15:10.135
This is getting out of control.
I need a phony poet tonight.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.436
What does he have to do?

15:11.510 --> 15:14.536
He just has to have a big afro, a dashiki...

15:14.613 --> 15:17.480
and stand in front of a crowd
and read some stuff I'll write.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.278
He has to be able to read?

15:24.189 --> 15:25.816
Yes, Jazz.

15:26.725 --> 15:29.353
That'll cost you two extra Jacksons,
but I know a guy.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.158
He's a sidewalk jewelry salesman
so he has free nights.

15:32.231 --> 15:36.258
But he'll need $60 cash in advance.

15:37.670 --> 15:41.265
- $60? Are you tripping? All I got is $20.
- He'll take it.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.737
Here's an extra $10. Get me a Rolex.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.141
I just can't believe it.

15:50.215 --> 15:53.150
Raphael de la Ghetto at Bel-Air Academy.

15:53.218 --> 15:55.778
Yes. I'm looking forward
to seeing him again.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.282
Will, is Raphael here yet?

15:59.358 --> 16:02.156
No. He'll probably be a little late.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.627
He likes his audience to be a little hostile.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.460
It's okay if he's running a little late.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.695
I just wrote a new poem
and I'm anxious to share it.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.904
Will, this is our night.

16:14.006 --> 16:16.031
Bringing Raphael de la Ghetto
here tonight...

16:16.108 --> 16:18.906
is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.469
I'm feeling really close to you right now.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.116
I don't know how to thank you.

16:25.184 --> 16:27.584
You don't have to thank me.

16:27.653 --> 16:31.783
But, Will, I want to after the reading.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.322
Will's gonna get thanked!

16:40.833 --> 16:42.300
What are you guys doing here?

16:42.368 --> 16:44.427
It's after dark, Master William.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.994
I thought it wise
to drive the young ladies...

16:47.072 --> 16:49.302
to ensure that they arrived safely.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.040
Are there any women my age here?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.746
- But why did you two come?
- Are you kidding?

16:56.815 --> 16:59.409
We heard the buzz
about this event on Melrose.

16:59.485 --> 17:03.546
I cannot believe your dinky, little school
got Raphael de la Ghetto to come.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.987
Why didn't you tell me
it was poetry night?

17:07.059 --> 17:09.721
You know
what a great lover of literature I am.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.887
I've never seen you read nothing.

17:12.631 --> 17:16.067
That's right. I suppose I just get
my horoscope out of the air.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.263
Jazz, where is the poet?

17:23.342 --> 17:25.276
Locked up in the steel hotel.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.505
Cops caught him
with a fistful of toy Rolexes.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.376
Yo, let's get out of here.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.580
Jazz, I can't go.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.675
After this, I'm getting thanked.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.685
<i>Ode to Judy.</i>

17:37.356 --> 17:40.052
<i>"Unfinished Sunday Times puzzle</i>

17:40.125 --> 17:43.219
"Lying limp on the hardwood floor

17:43.295 --> 17:46.025
"The society page spread open

17:46.098 --> 17:47.565
"My coffee is cold

17:49.001 --> 17:50.400
"It seems you are engaged

17:50.469 --> 17:53.336
"To a prominent investment banker

17:53.639 --> 17:55.038
"Prominent for what?

17:55.107 --> 17:57.302
"I'd very much like to know"

17:58.510 --> 18:00.034
We better go.

18:00.112 --> 18:03.411
This crowd will get ugly
if they got to listen to much more of that.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.144
The audience is growing restless.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.586
Where is this de la Ghetto fellow?

18:11.790 --> 18:14.258
I really stepped in it this time.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.793
I don't know what I'm going to do.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.158
What's wrong?

18:17.229 --> 18:21.097
There is no Raphael de la Ghetto.
I made him up.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.327
I just wanted to impress Christina.

18:23.402 --> 18:27.532
I even had Jazz hire a phony poet to come
tonight, but the dude didn't show up.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.068
There was extenuating circumstances.

18:31.543 --> 18:35.639
I don't know what I'm gonna do, G.
Christina is a very, very nice girl.

18:35.714 --> 18:39.616
If she finds out I lied to her,
she may never even speak to me again.

18:41.053 --> 18:45.922
Everyone, I'm sorry for the delay
but the big moment has finally come.

18:45.991 --> 18:46.980
I'd like to present...

18:47.059 --> 18:49.152
the man responsible
for this evening's event...

18:49.228 --> 18:50.855
Mr. Will Smith.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.430
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Raphael de la Ghetto.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.918
"Listen

19:24.997 --> 19:27.363
"To the street beat

19:27.432 --> 19:29.627
"Hear the sound pound

19:29.935 --> 19:31.766
"Plug your ears

19:31.837 --> 19:33.737
"Mask your fears

19:33.805 --> 19:36.239
"Something weird's going down

19:37.276 --> 19:39.972
"So listen to the street beat

19:40.245 --> 19:43.112
"Listen to the box shock

19:44.516 --> 19:46.643
"Listen, or I'll kill you"

19:56.862 --> 19:59.330
That was heavy, man.
Let's have another one.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.763
Encore.

20:04.002 --> 20:06.436
"Cannon to the right of them

20:06.505 --> 20:09.235
"Cannon to the left of them

20:09.641 --> 20:11.871
"Cannon in front of them

20:11.944 --> 20:14.435
"Volleyed and thundered"

20:15.147 --> 20:18.275
- Hilary, isn't that your butler?
- Yeah.

20:18.617 --> 20:21.085
It's a good look for him.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.218
"Came through the jaws of Death"

20:26.158 --> 20:27.853
Silence, you ungrateful children.

20:27.926 --> 20:31.089
When you're ready to be quiet and listen,
I shall return.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.129
That was your butler.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.962
Look, baby, let me explain.

20:36.034 --> 20:38.434
You don't even know de la Ghetto.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.994
I can't believe anything you've said to me.

20:41.306 --> 20:42.796
You're nothing but a liar.

20:42.874 --> 20:45.069
My man Will ain't no liar.

20:45.143 --> 20:46.303
Who are you?

20:46.511 --> 20:49.446
I am Raphael de la Ghetto.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.648
Where's your afro?
And where's your dashiki?

20:58.724 --> 21:00.817
I worked all that out in therapy.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.222
I don't know who to believe anymore.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.722
How do I know
you're the real Raphael de la Ghetto?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.131
Listen.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.972
"My love for you is like a river

21:17.909 --> 21:21.310
"Like a summer breeze
That makes my soul shiver

21:22.681 --> 21:25.878
"One look from you
Is more precious than gold

21:26.852 --> 21:29.753
"Let's go get some barbecue
And get busy"

21:37.829 --> 21:39.319
Tell me more.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.125
Works every time.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.970
"Cannon to the left of them

21:54.046 --> 21:56.173
"Cannon to the right of them"

21:58.250 --> 22:00.377
I'm sorry I missed that.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.980
So Jazz went out with Christina.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.750
That's cool, though, baby.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.792
I'm a poet,
and it's a lot more ink in this pen.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.222
I think you have a talent for poetry.

22:11.296 --> 22:13.764
I was just playing around with that stuff.

22:13.865 --> 22:16.629
But the poem that you wrote
got a standing ovation.

22:16.702 --> 22:19.330
That's right, and it got me a date.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.168
The other one you wrote got Jazz a date.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.175
The one I got out of your wastebasket
got me a date.

22:27.379 --> 22:30.371
Mommy, I'd like to hear a poem.
Could you read us one?

22:30.515 --> 22:31.812
Okay.

22:31.883 --> 22:35.182
This is a poem
that your father and I especially love.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.922
It's by Amiri Baraka.

22:37.989 --> 22:41.083
<i>It's called
Three Modes of History and Culture.</i>

22:43.628 --> 22:45.425
"I think about a time

22:45.497 --> 22:47.465
"When I will be relaxed

22:47.733 --> 22:50.133
"When flames and nonspecific passion

22:50.202 --> 22:52.033
"Wear themselves away

22:52.137 --> 22:55.834
"And my eyes and hands
And mind can turn

22:55.907 --> 22:57.374
"And soften

22:57.476 --> 23:00.172
"And the songs will be softer

23:00.245 --> 23:02.270
"And weight the air"

23:04.282 --> 23:07.809
If you'd like to learn more about poetry,
you can reach us at...

23:08.186 --> 23:10.620
Psych. We just kidding. Good night, y'all.
