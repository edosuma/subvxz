[ Sighs ] All right, guys, that's it.
Pack it up!

19:02.480 --> 19:05.791
You win for today.
See you on Monday.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.872
- That's it?
- That's it.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.469
So I'll go to city hall on
Monday and see what I can do,

19:10.560 --> 19:12.517
but... you did it, Cam.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.718
No, we did it. I had to run
away, and you stepped in,

19:15.840 --> 19:18.833
and like an understudy, you
gave a brilliant performance.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.673
Yeah, but you're the star.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.194
[ Chuckles ] Oh, well.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.637
Can we stop doing this
and go home?

19:25.720 --> 19:28.189
Yes, Lily, but I want you
to remember this moment.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.521
- The day your daddies made you proud.

Turn her away, Mitchell!

Turn her away!

- Alex, what are you doing here?

19:50.640 --> 19:54.998
Learning a valuable lesson
about karma...

19:55.080 --> 19:58.039
and how wrong it is to take
pleasure in people's embarrassment.

19:58.120 --> 20:03.036
Wow. I don't know what any of that
means, but you look like hell.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.156

Who does he belong to?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.152
He's mine.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.994
It was a great ending
to an amazing day.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.079
Look. I even made the paper.

put to sleep"? Don't read that.

Listen, I called Jay about borrowing
a drill for my dresser handles.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.554
I got it right here, Cam! Oh, geez.
What's with the getup?

20:53.640 --> 20:55.632
Ay, good.
You see that too?

[ Barking, Growling ]
Stella, stop.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.797
Ay. Shh, shh.
Sorry, Cam.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.190
Oh, no, don't be. I take it
as a compliment. [ Hisses ]

till next Thursday.
