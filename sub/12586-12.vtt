WEBVTT

00:32.323 --> 00:34.701
Boy, I never thought I'd do this again.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.536
Each time you buy a wheelbarrow,

00:36.619 --> 00:38.955
you tell yourself it's the last time.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.832
-Is it 5:00 already?

00:40.915 --> 00:43.877
-I should be getting home. I have plans.

00:45.795 --> 00:48.798
Evening plans. For tonight.

00:48.882 --> 00:49.924
We all do, Bill.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.177
-We're watching Hank use his wheelbarrow.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.846
Yep, I gotta shower up before dinner.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.931
The dinner I'm having with a guest.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.516
A female guest.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.020
-Should I order oysters...

01:02.103 --> 01:03.897
-...or is that too forward?

01:04.314 --> 01:07.233
Somebody ask me about my plans!
I have a date!

01:07.317 --> 01:09.903
A date? Well all right, that's something.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.029
Where'd you two meet?

01:11.112 --> 01:13.865
Oh, I haven't met her yet,
but Sergeant Dawson,

01:13.948 --> 01:17.410
who set us up, said she's
absolutely perfect for me.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.413
A woman who is perfect for Bill?

01:20.497 --> 01:21.748
Ugh!

01:21.831 --> 01:23.333
That's a disturbing image.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.377
-

01:26.461 --> 01:28.963
-Huh. John Redcorn doesn't work here.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.884
Oh, he works here, all right.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.094
If by "work here," you mean

01:34.177 --> 01:36.513
having casual sex.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.908
Excuse me, Bill?

01:57.742 --> 01:59.035
Bill Dauterive?

01:59.869 --> 02:01.037
Wow.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.584
So, Charlene, I understand
you're new to town?

02:06.668 --> 02:09.129
Actually, I lived in Arlen during my 20s,

02:09.212 --> 02:12.298
but I moved around a lot
and haven't been back until now.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.384
I don't know what we did without you.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.636
I'm thrilled to be back,

02:16.719 --> 02:19.264
and I think my kids should be happy here.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.432
You have kids?

02:23.309 --> 02:24.602
Wow.

02:27.939 --> 02:31.985
Charlene's smart, beautiful, and
she has kids!

02:32.068 --> 02:33.570
How did I get so lucky?

02:33.653 --> 02:36.197
You got lucky <i>because</i> she has kids.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.657
You can get quite a bargain

02:37.740 --> 02:39.325
if you're willing to date a single mom.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.619
Yeah, man, talkin' 'bout dang ol'...

02:41.744 --> 02:43.538
...like slightly used merchandise, man.

02:43.621 --> 02:46.875
I'll paint their rooms
like different fairy tales.

02:46.958 --> 02:50.503
And every night at bedtime,
I'll wander in like a different creature

02:50.587 --> 02:51.963
from the forest.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.971
I have 85 channels at home,

03:00.054 --> 03:03.016
and none of them beats watching Hank
use a crescent wrench.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.524
Hi. I'm looking for 122 Milton Street.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.568
Why? That's Bill's house.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.279
Uh, Bill's place is just across the alley.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.114
So, you must be Charlene.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.825
Yes, and these are my kids, Kate and Drew.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.411
Wow, what a beautiful lawn.

03:23.494 --> 03:25.371
It looks just like a golf course.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.998
Well, thank you, Kate.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.667
Hey, man. How ya doin',
lil' ol', lil' ol' shaver?

03:29.751 --> 03:31.002
Talkie' bout got your nose.

03:31.085 --> 03:34.422
Pardon me, sir, I'm ten.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.474
Um, hi.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.685
Afternoon...

03:48.937 --> 03:49.979
Kate!

03:51.814 --> 03:53.566
Boy, what nice kids.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.485
And that Charlene's a real beauty.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.903
No, I don't like her.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.572
How could you not like her?
Charlene seems great.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.824
I'm talking about the weird one, Kate.

04:01.908 --> 04:02.825
Didn't you see it?

04:02.909 --> 04:03.785
See what?

04:03.868 --> 04:05.828
The contours of her face,

04:05.912 --> 04:07.872
the hazel deadness in her eyes.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.583
Something is severely
un-right with that child.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.377
Potential pod-person.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.878
Probable robot.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.255
Possible pod-bot.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.674
Dale, those kids were
perfectly fine. They...

04:17.757 --> 04:20.927
Hank, you'd cozy up to Mussolini
if he liked your lawn.

04:21.010 --> 04:24.681
That girl is not one of us,
and I intend to prove it.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.307
Dang it, no you won't.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.476
Bill was lucky enough to meet a nice girl,

04:28.559 --> 04:29.894
and you're not gonna mess it up.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.104
My gut says...

04:31.187 --> 04:32.772
Ignore your gut.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.608
Just let it go and be happy for Bill.

04:41.197 --> 04:43.157
<i>My weird hunches are wrong.</i>

04:43.241 --> 04:46.160
I will ignore my gut
and be happy for Bill.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.912
I will ignore my gut and...

04:48.955 --> 04:51.708
I don't trust you.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.961
Hey, who wants to play a game?

04:55.044 --> 04:56.921
We're already playing a game.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.506
This one's better.

04:58.589 --> 05:01.050
It's called "Who Can Pluck the
Longest Hair From Their Head?"

05:01.134 --> 05:02.510
Kate, you first.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.803
Uh, I don't think...

05:03.886 --> 05:05.346
You don't have to!

05:05.430 --> 05:07.098
Ow! Hey!

05:07.557 --> 05:09.976
You're the winner!

05:11.352 --> 05:13.813
I didn't get a turn.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.862
This is so great.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.948
It's like I got married at 30
and my wife never left me!

05:24.032 --> 05:26.868
Yep, heh-heh. A lazy afternoon.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.996
Just the Hill family
and the Dauterive clan.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.290
And Joseph.

05:32.373 --> 05:35.668
Wow, Kate, you sure are good
with a grenade launcher.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.128
I like hand grenades

05:37.211 --> 05:39.297
because you can shove them
in people's mouths

05:39.380 --> 05:41.883
and watch their intestines blow out.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.646
So... Bill Dauterive.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.817
How shall I say this?

05:59.942 --> 06:03.154
Peggy, in my younger days,
a set of muscular arms

06:03.237 --> 06:05.323
and a bad attitude were
all I needed in a man.

06:05.406 --> 06:07.408
But as I've matured, I've realized

06:07.492 --> 06:11.037
a sweet, stable guy is a far better catch.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.163
I see.

06:12.246 --> 06:16.793
So you're attracted to the
muscular arms <i>inside</i> Bill?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.086
Something like that.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.256
And the fifth best thing about kids

06:22.382 --> 06:23.883
is the sound of their laughter.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.938
I was right!

06:37.021 --> 06:39.065
I knew there was something weird
about Kate.

06:39.148 --> 06:42.235
Kate? Dang it, Dale, you said
you were gonna drop this.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.737
And I would have, had her DNA test

06:44.821 --> 06:47.240
not yielded such amazing results.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.866
DNA test?

06:48.950 --> 06:51.953
The printout of her genetic
markers was oddly familiar,

06:52.036 --> 06:54.872
so I compared her results with another
set in my collection

06:54.956 --> 06:58.042
and found a point-by-point
match to precisely one-half

06:58.126 --> 07:02.088
the DNA sequence of the second
individual, Joseph.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.047
What are you...

07:03.131 --> 07:05.842
Joseph and Kate share paternal DNA.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.010
They have the same father.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.721
Oh, God. Dale...

07:10.805 --> 07:12.265
So this means...

07:12.348 --> 07:16.519
Precisely. Kate is my daughter.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.854
Huh?

07:23.359 --> 07:25.236
How could Kate be your daughter?

07:25.319 --> 07:27.947
As you may recall, I learned some time ago

07:28.030 --> 07:30.950
that Joseph was conceived while
I was away from Nancy,

07:31.033 --> 07:34.537
an anomaly that can only be explained
by alien gene traders

07:34.620 --> 07:38.082
covertly planting my DNA
into my sleeping wife.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.251
Uh... right...

07:40.334 --> 07:43.921
After impregnating Nancy, the
aliens must have then left

07:44.005 --> 07:46.716
my genetic material
with Charlene in the hopes

07:46.799 --> 07:50.136
of engineering a master race,
with me as the foundation.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.013
The "how" is simple enough.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.474
It's the "why" that troubles me.

07:54.557 --> 07:58.311
Uh, well, Dale, aliens
are an unpredictable bunch,

07:58.394 --> 08:02.190
so, uh, I think your best bet
is to do nothing.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.151
Yep. Nothing.

08:08.946 --> 08:12.658
So all the while that Nancy was
cheating on Dale with John Redcorn,

08:12.742 --> 08:15.786
John Redcorn was cheating
on Nancy with Charlene?

08:15.870 --> 08:18.206
And he's the father of Joseph and Kate,

08:18.289 --> 08:20.958
while Dale thinks Joseph and Kate are his?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.376
Pretty much.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.879
Oh, my God.

08:24.962 --> 08:28.925
This is like sitting poolside
at freakin' Melrose Place!

08:29.008 --> 08:31.469
The only question is who to call first!

08:31.552 --> 08:34.138
Now hold on, Peggy,
let's not rock the boat.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.015
Bill has a girlfriend.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.643
Hank, I cannot keep this to myself!

08:38.726 --> 08:39.894
I have to tell...

08:39.977 --> 08:43.773
Oh, I can't tell Nancy. Or Charlene.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.943
And you probably shouldn't tell Bill.
Or Dale.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.862
And God knows Boomhauer
can't keep a secret.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.782
We can't tell anyone.

08:52.865 --> 08:56.035
Yep. There's not a thing we can do.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.134
Bobby, why are you not outside
with Kate and Joseph!?

09:12.218 --> 09:14.303
They're getting way too chummy.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.014
It's like they only want
to hang out with each other.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.267
Are you gonna let yourself
get squeezed out?

09:19.350 --> 09:20.768
No friend? No girlfriend?

09:20.851 --> 09:22.228
Is that what you want?

09:22.311 --> 09:23.354
No.

09:23.437 --> 09:26.399
Then get out there
and fight for your spot!

09:26.482 --> 09:29.110
Third musketeer! Go, go, go!

09:29.193 --> 09:32.071
This is how you throw a spiral.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.032
Hey, throw to me! I'm open!

09:42.707 --> 09:44.584
Aliens!

09:44.667 --> 09:48.379
I know your rubbery, glowing
hands are in this, but why?

09:48.462 --> 09:51.507
I need to take this investigation
to the front lines.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.473
Look who it is!

09:59.557 --> 10:01.684
What brings you to my favorite restaurant

10:01.767 --> 10:03.060
that I never talk about?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.186
Oh, hey, Dale.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.564
We're just sitting down for a family meal.

10:06.647 --> 10:07.857
Why don't you join us?

10:07.940 --> 10:11.277
Well... well, maybe for just a minute.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.119
Good choice on the mashed potatoes, Kate.

10:20.202 --> 10:23.831
Tasty, and a fun place to sculpt
your subconscious thoughts.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.167
Mm-hmm...

10:26.250 --> 10:28.419
Eh... hmm...

10:28.502 --> 10:33.341
Don't know what to do with that.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.350
Nancy, quick question about the
night Joseph was conceived:

10:42.433 --> 10:46.145
When the aliens teleported here
to impregnate you with my DNA,

10:46.228 --> 10:49.565
do you remember anything unusual?

10:49.649 --> 10:50.650
Excuse me?

10:50.733 --> 10:52.693
It seems I have another child.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.363
I ran a DNA test on the
daughter of Bill's girlfriend

10:55.446 --> 10:58.616
and found out she and Joseph
have the same father.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.575
I'm sorry.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.662
Did you say Joseph and this girl
have the same father?

11:02.745 --> 11:05.373
Not only that, but they were
born just a few days apart.

11:05.873 --> 11:09.293
Yep, I guess you and Charlene
were visited by the same aliens.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.003
In the same week.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.630
Maybe the same day.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.176
I need to make a call.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.431
But I never even met a Charlene!

11:24.642 --> 11:25.893
Oh, hey, Shug.

11:25.976 --> 11:26.936
You're home early.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.896
John Redcorn. Good to see you.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.190
Did Nancy tell you about Joseph's sister,

11:31.273 --> 11:32.733
i.e., my daughter?

11:32.817 --> 11:34.902
Yes. But there must be some mistake.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.487
That's not what the DNA says!

11:36.570 --> 11:37.780
Well, it's wrong!

11:37.863 --> 11:40.616
I never... I mean,
Dale never cheated on you.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.743
Of course not. The aliens--

11:42.827 --> 11:44.412
Never, John Redcorn?

11:44.495 --> 11:47.873
You're saying
Dale didn't cheat on me even once?

11:47.957 --> 11:51.043
I'm not sure why John Redcorn
would have that information,

11:51.127 --> 11:52.044
but, no, I--

11:52.128 --> 11:54.171
Okay... maybe there were
isolated incidents!

11:54.255 --> 11:56.382
But Dale always took precautions!

11:56.465 --> 11:58.342
So now it's "incidents"?

11:58.426 --> 11:59.593
Nancy, please!

11:59.677 --> 12:01.679
It's... it's very complex.

12:01.762 --> 12:02.596
Huh!

12:04.598 --> 12:08.811
John Redcorn is right,
the alien plan is far too complex!

12:08.894 --> 12:11.772
I guess we should follow
Hank's advice and do nothing.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.151
I feel better already.

12:18.487 --> 12:21.490
Uh, Hank, you were right.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.783
It feels good not trying

12:22.867 --> 12:25.411
to figure out this whole alien thing.

12:25.494 --> 12:28.330
Yep, and it's better
if you don't even talk about it.

12:28.414 --> 12:32.168
Yep. It's back to a mundane life
of drinking beer

12:32.251 --> 12:35.713
and helping my jackass friends
shop for wheelbarrows.

12:35.796 --> 12:36.881
Guys!

12:36.964 --> 12:38.674
I have great news!

12:38.758 --> 12:40.926
I asked Charlene and the kids
to move in with me...

12:41.010 --> 12:42.428
and they said yes!

12:42.511 --> 12:43.387
What?

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847
Wow, way to go, Bill.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.850
Mmm. I'm having a big party
tomorrow to welcome them.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.226
See you then!

12:49.351 --> 12:51.812
No, nuh-uh, no way!

12:51.896 --> 12:53.856
Alien masterplans are one thing,

12:53.939 --> 12:55.816
but this I cannot accept!

12:55.900 --> 12:59.278
Bill Dauterive will not raise my daughter.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.911
If you have some idea of what we
should be doing, I'm listening.

13:08.829 --> 13:09.872
All right, then.

13:12.541 --> 13:16.504
Kahn, Minh, so glad you could
be here to share our joy.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.923
We wouldn't miss it for the world!

13:19.006 --> 13:20.633
We so happy for you!

13:23.093 --> 13:25.971
Now where that bastard child
Peggy Hill tell you about?

13:26.055 --> 13:27.431
You do it.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.141
No, I want you to do it.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.060
Let's do it together.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.607
Smashin' ant hills, huh?

13:36.690 --> 13:39.819
Gosh, we all have so much fun together.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.783
So Charlene's moving in, huh?

13:45.866 --> 13:48.369
Have you told her all
about your idiosyncrasies,

13:48.452 --> 13:49.870
like your fear of floss,

13:49.954 --> 13:53.207
or how you use your loofah
for non-loofah purposes?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.629
Charlene loves me for who I am.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.339
She told me so last night.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.011
Charlene, congratulations.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.723
Say, have you seen the 1987 film
<i>The Stepfather,</i>

14:09.807 --> 14:12.643
where a seemingly loving man
cozies up to a single mother

14:12.726 --> 14:14.770
only to go nuts and kill everyone?

14:14.854 --> 14:17.982
It stars the bald guy from <i>Lost.</i>

14:27.032 --> 14:28.909
John Redcorn? Is that you?

14:28.993 --> 14:29.910
Dale.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.454
You must be wondering
why I'm hiding behind this bush.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.624
No, I just figured there was
a cool Indian reason.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.334
Is there a cool Indian reason?

14:37.418 --> 14:38.919
Yes.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.380
But I also wanted to see Joseph's sister.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.715
And her mother.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.592
That's Charlene.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.635
Candi?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.304
Sorry, I don't have any.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.599
You know, the mothers
of my children are pretty hot.

14:51.682 --> 14:55.352
The aliens seem partial to
pouty lips and an ample bosom.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.146
Yes. Yes, they do.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.480
Well, I'm leaving.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.567
Couldn't even turn a woman off Bill--
how's that for sad?

15:01.650 --> 15:04.612
I wish I had a debonair
ladies' man to seduce her.

15:04.695 --> 15:07.489
Too bad Boomhauer finds
motherhood disgusting.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.408
Well, see ya later, John...

15:09.491 --> 15:11.869
Redcorn! Of course!

15:11.952 --> 15:12.828
I'm sorry?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.122
John Redcorn, I bet <i>you </i>
could romance a woman

15:15.205 --> 15:18.000
out of a relationship with a giant doofus!

15:18.083 --> 15:21.587
Dale, are you asking me to steal
your friend's companion?

15:21.670 --> 15:24.340
I don't want my child raised by an idiot!

15:24.423 --> 15:27.968
Yes. It's very difficult to watch an
idiot raise your child.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.220
Then join me, and together,
we can strike down

15:30.304 --> 15:32.598
this perverse and unholy union!

15:32.681 --> 15:34.934
There's some sex in it for ya.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.650
Very well. I will help.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.859
Wingo!

15:44.610 --> 15:45.986
The sex will be with Charlene.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.279
You got that part, right?

15:54.662 --> 15:57.164
Bill, the kids already like you.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.583
You don't need to buy all this
junk food to win them over.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.503
Ye... Yeah, yes. Kids.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.755
Hmm, that's just what I was doing.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.091
Bill! What a relief.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.259
I dropped my keys in the
back of the meat freezer

16:09.343 --> 16:10.970
and I need someone well insulated

16:11.053 --> 16:12.429
to fish them out for me.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.140
I'm kinda the go-to guy
for stuff like this.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.350
I'll be right back.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.939
John Redcorn.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.984
Hello, Candi. It's been a long time.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.360
Yes, it has.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.570
I haven't gone by my stage name in years.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.738
It's Charlene now.

16:29.822 --> 16:34.410
Your name may have changed,
but your incredible beauty has not.

16:36.745 --> 16:40.624
So, Bill, how's life as a not-entirely
legal guardian?

16:40.708 --> 16:43.210
O-Oh, great. Just-just great.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.462
A little tiring, but so worth it.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.464
I've had a lot of quality
time with the kids

16:47.548 --> 16:50.050
since Charlene hooked up
with her old girlfriends.

16:51.135 --> 16:51.969
Oh, yeah?

16:52.052 --> 16:53.429
Nice buncha gals, are they?

16:53.512 --> 16:54.346
I haven't met them,

16:54.430 --> 16:55.889
but they seem fun.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.434
they've kept Charlene out
late every night this week.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.147
Just remembered a funny sniglet.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.440
Bill, honey!

17:04.523 --> 17:05.774
I'm meeting the girls for lunch.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.317
Can you come back to the house?

17:07.401 --> 17:10.404
Well, gotta go watch the kids.

17:11.155 --> 17:15.242
Good times.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.462
Hey, partner!

17:27.504 --> 17:29.298
Just wanted to get a status report.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.133
Phase one, infiltration,

17:31.216 --> 17:33.802
seems to have been
accomplished. Repeatedly.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.097
When do we get to phase two,
Charlene breaking up with Bill?

17:37.181 --> 17:40.059
Dale, romancing a woman
out of a relationship

17:40.142 --> 17:41.935
requires much energy.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.687
Okay, but let's not drag it out.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.230
I'd like to shatter Bill's happiness

17:45.314 --> 17:47.316
in a way that doesn't leave him all mopey.

17:49.359 --> 17:52.321
So, going out to meet
the girls, huh? Again?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.822
I'm sorry.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.075
It's just that seeing the
girls after all this time

17:56.158 --> 17:58.494
has brought back some fond memories.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.913
Do you want me to cancel
so I can watch the kids?

18:00.996 --> 18:04.458
No, no, ha-have a good time
with your girlfriends.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.836
I was gonna take the kids
to Captain Bear's Pizza.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.756
Let 'em crawl all over someone
else's furniture for a change.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.675
Oh, Bill, you're so good
with Kate and Drew.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.385
They have so much fun with you.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.429
Yeah, I do with them, too.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.515
They're... They're just a big bundle of--

18:19.598 --> 18:21.642
I'll get the fire extinguisher!

18:31.527 --> 18:33.779
Was that... John Redcorn?

18:33.862 --> 18:37.533
I know! How long does it take
to steal a woman from Bill?

18:39.576 --> 18:41.745
Perhaps I should explain.

18:41.829 --> 18:46.041
Um, you see, I've recruited
John Redcorn to seduce Charlene.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.294
Soon my daughter will be out
of that screw-up Bill's house

18:49.378 --> 18:52.881
and back in the healthy embrace
of a single-parent family.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.593
You asked John Redcorn
to break up Bill and Charlene?

18:56.677 --> 19:00.472
Ah, dang it, I tried not to get
involved, but this tears it.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.182
Let's go.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.060
Bill, Dale's got something to tell you.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.021
Hey, Bill. What's going on?

19:08.105 --> 19:10.107
Oh, just hanging laundry.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.276
Kids sure do like playing with mustard.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.735
Mustard. Heh.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.445
That's kids for ya.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.325
Bill... I have a confession.

19:20.409 --> 19:24.079
Charlene hasn't been out
with her girlfriends the past two weeks.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.165
She's been with John Redcorn.

19:26.248 --> 19:29.084
J-J-John Redcorn? How do you...

19:29.168 --> 19:30.127
I set it up.

19:30.210 --> 19:33.547
Charlene and John Redcorn...
are having an affair.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.257
Not in the face!

19:36.592 --> 19:38.385
You did hear him, right, Bill?

19:38.468 --> 19:39.678
Yeah.

19:39.761 --> 19:40.596
I'm sorry.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.972
I-I just went a little nuts

19:42.055 --> 19:44.266
when I found out you'd be
raising my daughter.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.642
What's that now?

19:45.726 --> 19:49.104
Uh, Dale tested Kate's DNA and, uh,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.565
she and Joseph have the same father.

19:54.902 --> 19:58.363
Joseph and Kate have the same father.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.448
You.

20:07.497 --> 20:09.458
Charlene and John Redcorn, huh?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.418
They seem like a good couple.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.003
So you're not filled with rage?

20:13.086 --> 20:16.423
Actually, I feel... okay.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.175
I don't think I'm cut out for parenthood.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.927
Actually, I hate kids!

20:20.010 --> 20:21.136
I mean, not all kids,

20:21.220 --> 20:23.472
but just, just the ones
that are around all the time.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.475
Dang it, Bill Cosby made it
look fun and I fell for it.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.143
We all fell for it.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.021
Plus, I had a woman
stolen by John Redcorn.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.272
That's kind of an honor.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.941
We should all be so lucky.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.240
So Charlene and the kids are moving
in with John Redcorn.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.866
Sure was nice of Redcorn

20:42.950 --> 20:45.160
to agree to raise my child for me.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.246
Can't say I'd do the same.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.506
She was like... the other half of my soul.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.216
And now she's gone.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.801
This must be what those songs

21:00.884 --> 21:03.053
by the chick with the boobs were about.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.763
I know it hurts, buddy.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.058
But on the bright side, you still got me!

21:08.141 --> 21:10.060
Yeah. Thanks.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.481
She had a lot of eyebrows
for a chick, anyway.
