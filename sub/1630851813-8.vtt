WEBVTT

00:15.972 --> 00:17.974
Trey.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.064
Cap!

00:21.108 --> 00:22.544
Cap!

00:22.587 --> 00:24.067
Cap, can you hear me?

00:24.111 --> 00:25.721
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey,

00:25.764 --> 00:26.983
just hang on tight.
I'm coming over to you,

00:27.027 --> 00:28.680
- all right?
- No, no, you stay where you are.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.378
No, that's not an option.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.171
Come on, Cap.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.800
- He get you?
- What do you mean, did he get me?

01:01.844 --> 01:03.454
You got two holes in you,
you're asking about me?

01:04.934 --> 01:06.936
We need to get you
to a hospital, Cap.

01:06.979 --> 01:09.330
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.940
<i>How we doing, Captain?</i>

01:10.983 --> 01:12.420
Oh, I'm just dandy.

01:12.463 --> 01:15.031
You sure you don't
want me to drive?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.815
Hey, I didn't catch your name.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.991
Trooper Alexis Jackson.
Call me Jack.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.428
It's good to meet you, Jack.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.212
Do you have a, uh, first aid kit
around here somewhere?

01:22.256 --> 01:23.344
Uh, try back here.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.172
Oh, you know what, uh,

01:25.215 --> 01:26.999
- this is gonna work.
- It's a good thing
you showed up early,

01:27.043 --> 01:28.914
huh, Jack?
Well, you know,
Mom always said,

01:28.958 --> 01:30.133
"If you're on time,
you're late."

01:30.177 --> 01:31.221
Didn't expect to come in
on this, though.

01:33.397 --> 01:35.965
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, what
are you doing, man? Sit back.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.794
This... this is Ranger
Captain Larry James.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.622
We need a clear path...

01:40.665 --> 01:42.406
on North Lamar.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.278
Officer down,
en route to hospital.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.106
Multiples... shots sustained.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.281
Hey, hey, whoa, Cap.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.934
You're losing
a lot of blood, man.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.505
We got to slow the bleeding.

01:54.549 --> 01:57.073
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
- whoa, whoa, whoa.
- The shooter...

01:57.117 --> 01:58.509
Lean back, all right?
Just breathe.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.511
Focus on breathing.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.078
Cap. Cap!

02:03.862 --> 02:05.995
- What's our ETA?
- Five minutes, maybe.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.127
You better make it two.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.737
Copy that.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.439
What have we got?

02:15.483 --> 02:18.181
Mid-40s, GSW to the right
outer thigh and upper chest.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.791
Lost consciousness on the way

02:19.835 --> 02:21.445
- and his pulse was thready.
- We got the captain

02:21.489 --> 02:22.751
of the Rangers here.
Unknown assailant

02:22.794 --> 02:24.100
and motive.
Gonna need to get this place

02:24.144 --> 02:25.754
- locked up tight.
- We got it from here.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.974
Tell Walker... he needs to-to...

02:48.864 --> 02:50.431
Look, Dad, I-I'm gonna
pull out the timer.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.174
Any day, now.

02:54.217 --> 02:57.177
Okay, there's no time limit
on due process.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.526
I mean, you claim
it was Mr. Green

02:58.569 --> 03:00.092
in the conservatory
with the revolver,

03:00.136 --> 03:02.138
but the time and place suggest

03:02.182 --> 03:05.010
a crime of passion.
He doesn't fit the bill.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.099
You're seriously
making me regret

03:07.143 --> 03:09.667
agreeing to amend the game
for a more

03:09.711 --> 03:11.321
layered experience.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.457
Hey, DJ's calling you.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.241
That's random.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.637
It's still your turn, Dad.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.639
One sec, bud.

03:31.820 --> 03:34.301
Trey. Hey, what's up?

03:43.788 --> 03:44.963
Trey.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.270
Hey. Is he-is he...Hey. No. No, no, no.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.098
I haven't heard anything
yet. I know they just

03:49.141 --> 03:51.013
rushed him into surgery,
but that's...

03:51.056 --> 03:52.406
- that's about it.
- Hi-His, uh,

03:52.449 --> 03:54.886
- his son called Stella.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. I-I...

03:54.930 --> 03:57.062
I got his family info from
Connie and I reached out.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.194
Are you okay?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.413
Yeah... Yeah.

03:59.456 --> 04:00.544
Yeah, yeah, no,
no, no, I'm-I'm...

04:00.588 --> 04:02.764
I'm good. I-I didn't get hit.

04:02.807 --> 04:05.506
But this whole thing just
happened so fast. I...

04:05.549 --> 04:06.768
What the hell happened?

04:06.811 --> 04:07.899
Trooper Jackson here.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.292
I responded to the scene
and was set

04:09.336 --> 04:10.902
to watch over Trey Barnett
before the incident.

04:10.946 --> 04:14.254
Yeah. Uh, HQ updated me.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.690
We have any news?

04:15.733 --> 04:16.908
From what little
your captain gave us

04:16.952 --> 04:18.432
and Mr. Barnett's account,
we're not

04:18.475 --> 04:20.434
currently able to discern
motive and target.

04:20.477 --> 04:21.870
Didn't get an ID

04:21.913 --> 04:23.611
and no one
saw the license plates.

04:24.699 --> 04:25.874
Doc.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.310
Is he okay?

04:27.354 --> 04:28.790
The family asked that
I update you all.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.400
Thankfully, the
bullets bypassed

04:30.444 --> 04:32.359
any major organs
and arteries.

04:32.402 --> 04:34.404
He'll be out for a few more
hours, but I'm positive

04:34.448 --> 04:35.884
about his prognosis.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.233
As soon as he's
in a room,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.104
I'll have someone get you.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.324
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.673
Yeah.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.196
Uh, thanks.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.506
Hey, Walker.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.379
Thought you might want this.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.884
You look like hell, Cordi.

05:19.928 --> 05:23.018
Captain. You're awake.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.802
Great. I should
tell, um...

05:24.846 --> 05:26.848
No, no, man, no.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.242
Hey, anything from the, uh...

05:31.722 --> 05:34.246
...that car we spotted
at the house?

05:34.290 --> 05:35.770
The guy that came after me--

05:35.813 --> 05:37.293
he didn't match
the registered owner.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.903
But I don't know--

05:38.947 --> 05:41.079
still could
be connected to Serano.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.081
Anything?

05:43.125 --> 05:45.649
- Uh, no, Captain.
- Not yet.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.956
Uh, but everybody's
working on this.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.740
We will find this guy.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.525
I know you will.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.265
Which is why
I'm gonna tell the D.A.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.529
that I don't want anybody else
running point on this.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.008
Right. Yeah, uh,

05:57.052 --> 05:58.358
which means...

05:59.707 --> 06:01.012
...you're gonna want this back.

06:02.318 --> 06:05.669
I need you
running point on this, Cordell.

06:05.713 --> 06:06.844
Buck's gonna
stop with you,

06:06.888 --> 06:10.282
just like it does
with me as captain.

06:10.326 --> 06:12.023
Larry, I...Listen, you know

06:12.067 --> 06:14.286
all the players,
you know the local rangers,

06:14.330 --> 06:17.072
the D.A., the city.
It's you, man.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.379
You just got to
promise me something.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.511
Of course. Anything.

06:21.555 --> 06:24.775
You know, when
one of us gets hit,

06:24.819 --> 06:27.691
things can go sideways
pretty quickly.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.041
I don't want anybody

06:30.085 --> 06:31.434
playing judge, jury

06:31.478 --> 06:34.219
or, God forbid, executioner

06:34.263 --> 06:35.743
on my behalf.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.353
No matter the intention.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.921
You got to make sure
that doesn't happen.

06:39.964 --> 06:43.403
All right.
- Yep, you got it.
- Okay.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.842
Dad. Oh, my God.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.409
Are you okay?

06:49.452 --> 06:50.758
I'm gonna give y'all
some time.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.499
Yeah.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.503
What's up, buddy?

07:01.203 --> 07:02.334
I'm good, man.

07:06.121 --> 07:09.254
All right. All right.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.473
What do we got?

07:18.220 --> 07:19.787
- Collins tosses out
- the dime. And holy smokes!
- And that's my guy.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.484
Got, like,
a million interceptions

07:21.528 --> 07:22.833
this season.
You're telling me he's not

07:22.877 --> 07:24.487
- an elite player-- please.
- Interceptions are great,

07:24.531 --> 07:26.837
but that's not what
makes an elite cornerback.

07:26.881 --> 07:27.882
You're out of your mind.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.753
Y'all are both trippin'.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.408
Just...Well, weigh in on this, Mom.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.410
I don't know why you're
entertaining an argument

07:34.454 --> 07:36.151
with the man
that drafted a quarterback

07:36.194 --> 07:38.501
in the fourth round
of our fantasy league.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.025
Oh, yeah, just
pick on the injured guy.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.287
It wasn't a head injury.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.767
Oh...

07:43.811 --> 07:45.116
That's good, Kelly.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.509
Pile it on.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.119
- Dad.
- Hey, Larry,

07:48.163 --> 07:50.208
you were just shot.
You need rest.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.733
Please, tell me you are not
about to work right now.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.868
Kelly. Hey.

08:00.697 --> 08:01.655
Good to see you.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.004
Yeah, good to see you, too.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.179
I just, uh, wanted

08:04.222 --> 08:05.441
to introduce you
to Trey.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.182
He brought
Larry in.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.314
Thank you. Seriously.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.621
Don't know what we would've
done if you weren't there.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.887
Uh, yeah, of course, uh,

08:16.931 --> 08:18.802
I was just in the right
place at the right time.

08:18.846 --> 08:21.065
I'm happy to help.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.763
And I'm glad
to see you awake, my man.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.155
Hey.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.548
Thank you.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.594
Yeah.

08:27.637 --> 08:31.119
Well, I'm, uh, I'm gonna
let you guys get to it.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.642
- Thanks, Trey.
- Of course.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.038
You look good.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.343
- Aw, thanks.
- The kids, too.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.562
Yeah.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.998
Last time I saw you was...

08:41.042 --> 08:42.130
Em's funeral.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.218
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.569
Okay, will you please

08:46.613 --> 08:49.137
tell this man that he doesn't
need to be working right now?

08:50.747 --> 08:52.314
Uh...

08:52.357 --> 08:53.837
What's the word, Walker?

08:53.881 --> 08:55.535
And here we go again.

08:55.578 --> 08:58.146
Goodbye. We are leaving.
- Good to see you.
- Goodbye.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.147
- Good to see you.
- You too.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.149
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.893
- What's up?
- Good news is that
we got a crew

09:05.936 --> 09:08.025
ready to work
around the clock at HQ.

09:08.069 --> 09:11.812
we're
still waiting on ballistics.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.596
But, as you know,

09:13.640 --> 09:15.729
that still probably won't
provide a solid lead.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.775
James, we're on a manhunt

09:18.819 --> 09:21.386
- with no idea who the man is.
- Okay.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.606
North Side Nation? You...Uh, looking into it, yeah.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.521
But everyone there
with remaining ties

09:25.565 --> 09:27.610
pretty much scattered
after Serano was busted.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.786
And the car you called in
was a no-go.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.571
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:34.791 --> 09:35.879
Hey.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.054
Yeah.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.012
You got this.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.927
Yeah. Yeah.

09:39.970 --> 09:41.276
You know how I like run an op,

09:41.319 --> 09:43.104
even though
you tend to ignore it.

09:44.671 --> 09:48.239
What's the next call?

09:48.283 --> 09:50.633
I think I may know
a potential informant

09:50.677 --> 09:52.113
who had ties to Serano.

09:52.156 --> 09:54.419
All right. Keep me up on it.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.987
Will do. All right, Cap.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.795
Hello, Cordell.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.061
Stan.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.901
Uh, news travels fast.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.990
I heard about James.
That's, uh,

10:43.033 --> 10:45.122
truly terrible.
Please send my regards.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.822
Hey, you know, you can keep
your regards to yourself, Stan.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.650
You don't get to feel
any way about that.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.303
Not after what you've done.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.001
How's your brother?

10:55.219 --> 10:59.093
I heard the Davidsons are back
and one of them took his job?

10:59.136 --> 11:01.443
Although, technically,
I guess it was my job, but...

11:01.486 --> 11:03.271
Aw...

11:03.314 --> 11:05.316
forget the election.
It's still a tough break.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.101
I'm not here to talk about Liam.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.669
Well, why are you here,
then, Cordell?

11:12.062 --> 11:14.282
You were in bed with
North Side Nation for years.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.545
I seem to recall, last
time we were together,

11:16.588 --> 11:19.374
I ended up in a sniper's
crosshairs. You did

11:19.417 --> 11:20.854
manage to warn me about Serano,

11:20.897 --> 11:23.378
though the tip could've used
a little more context.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.380
And here I thought
you'd use

11:25.423 --> 11:27.991
your investigative skills

11:28.035 --> 11:29.514
to figure it all out.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.081
Or maybe you thought

11:31.125 --> 11:33.562
I'd go digging down
the wrong hole and end up dead.

11:33.605 --> 11:36.130
Well, you're here, aren't you?

11:36.173 --> 11:37.697
Guess it all worked out.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.179
Or did it?

11:43.224 --> 11:44.442
Wait a minute.

11:44.486 --> 11:47.184
You think Serano
came after James?

11:48.229 --> 11:49.752
He definitely
has the manpower

11:49.796 --> 11:51.449
to carry out a hit
from the inside.

11:51.493 --> 11:53.843
- Which brought me here.
- No, no. Come on.

11:53.887 --> 11:56.759
You and I have seen, personally,

11:56.803 --> 11:58.282
the way he calls a hit.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.241
It's professional.

12:02.634 --> 12:04.071
And that was just for you.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.637
If it was for
a big fish like James,

12:05.681 --> 12:06.769
he'd be pulling out
all the stops.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.423
No, it-it doesn't
make any sense.

12:08.466 --> 12:09.903
And what if he was desperate?

12:09.946 --> 12:11.600
I don't know
why he would be.

12:11.643 --> 12:14.168
That little stunt that
Liam pulled? Word around here

12:14.211 --> 12:16.605
is that it could have Serano
walking on everything.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.826
Which would make
going after James extra stupid.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.349
And Serano's
a lot of things,

12:21.392 --> 12:22.785
but stupid is definitely
not one of them.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.309
But you knew all this.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.790
What do you want?
How do I come in?

12:30.140 --> 12:33.230
Okay. Uh, well...

12:33.274 --> 12:36.668
long shot. But...

12:36.712 --> 12:38.148
you know James.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.760
You know the players,
the system. Same as I do.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.762
Hell, m-maybe
even better than I do.

12:42.805 --> 12:46.635
Now, yes, you played both sides
for all those years,

12:46.678 --> 12:48.245
but you promoted James.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.725
You believed in him.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.945
I-I thought
you might know...

12:57.254 --> 13:01.215
You can never
really know someone, truly.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.043
There's always gonna be secrets.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.436
Doesn't matter
who they are.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.960
I mean, hell,
I walked around

13:07.003 --> 13:09.310
for a year
with the biggest one of all.

13:11.442 --> 13:12.922
You trying to piss me off?

13:12.966 --> 13:14.750
You and James

13:14.794 --> 13:17.492
- are nothing alike.
- James represents the best of us,

13:17.535 --> 13:19.363
you're right about that.
But I...

13:19.407 --> 13:21.844
Everyone's a hero
in their own story

13:21.888 --> 13:23.541
and a villain in someone else's,

13:23.585 --> 13:25.848
and from a distance,
sometimes it's difficult to tell

13:25.892 --> 13:26.849
which one you're looking at.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.939
You know, my viewpoint is

13:29.983 --> 13:31.811
currently somewhat limited,

13:31.854 --> 13:34.161
given my situation.

13:34.204 --> 13:37.991
But, seems to me that if you're
looking for the bad guy,

13:38.034 --> 13:39.819
you might want to try to start

13:39.862 --> 13:41.821
finding him
among the good ones.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.519
Right.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.958
Okay. Well...

13:49.002 --> 13:51.308
that's all you got to say, um...

13:53.267 --> 13:55.573
Enjoy rotting in here.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.143
Guard.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.641
Cardiotech to the ICU.
Cardiotech to the ICU.

14:19.684 --> 14:20.990
What?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.558
You've been
in a lot of hospitals.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.039
- Yeah.
- Usually just ER visits,

14:26.082 --> 14:29.085
though, you know. Concussions.
Stitches and staples.

14:29.129 --> 14:32.262
You always had to talk my mom
down from coming to check on me.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.916
She was always blowing up
my phone, talking about,

14:33.960 --> 14:35.787
"Make sure
he gets his medicine."

14:35.831 --> 14:37.746
Vapor rub and ginger ale.

14:37.789 --> 14:38.921
- Ginger ale.
- That's it.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.227
Yeah. Yeah.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.185
All those years,

14:42.229 --> 14:43.883
we never once
ended up here.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.754
Grateful we got to keep
the memories of this place clean

14:45.797 --> 14:47.712
as long as we did.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.019
Think they still have
the same artwork

14:50.063 --> 14:51.803
they had when DJ was born here?

14:51.847 --> 14:53.414
Ooh, that day.

14:53.457 --> 14:56.069
That kid put me
through the wringer.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.940
Big-headed, 11 pounds.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.637
He was a giant.

14:59.681 --> 15:00.812
And you kept
trying to say,

15:00.856 --> 15:02.205
"Oh, well, he didn't
get it from me."

15:02.249 --> 15:03.903
Like you aren't six, three.

15:04.773 --> 15:05.730
With a big head.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.299
You were so mad at me that day.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.954
Because you forgot
the hospital bag.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.260
Hey, I...N... Uh-uh. You had

15:13.303 --> 15:15.784
one job.
We talked about it for months.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.220
Okay, in my defense...Oh, no, no, shh, shh, shh.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.656
You had a newborn
in one hand,

15:18.700 --> 15:20.745
some murder case file in
the other and you were

15:20.789 --> 15:21.964
looking all goofy, remember,

15:22.008 --> 15:23.444
in that
"World's Best Grandma" shirt

15:23.487 --> 15:24.967
from the gift shop?

15:25.011 --> 15:26.273
I still have that shirt.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.883
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.451
Come a long way since then, huh?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.757
Look at us now.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.719
I never imagined

15:37.762 --> 15:40.722
that we'd end up divorced,

15:40.765 --> 15:41.723
- Kelly.
- Larry...

15:41.766 --> 15:43.464
No, I just...
This is, like,

15:43.507 --> 15:45.945
the first real conversation
we've had in...

15:45.988 --> 15:47.033
what, a year?

15:48.077 --> 15:49.252
We're only having it

15:49.296 --> 15:51.211
'cause I'm laid up
in a hospital bed again.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.782
How long you gonna
keep on like this?

15:59.523 --> 16:00.916
I don't know.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.005
I had it all laid out.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.138
I thought I knew exactly
who was gonna take my place.

16:05.181 --> 16:08.097
I mean, you know,
when the time was right,

16:08.141 --> 16:09.620
but...

16:09.664 --> 16:10.970
now, not so much.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.189
The future's a lot less clear.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.584
Maybe you should start
thinking about it.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.587
Yeah.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.780
Look at that--
already looking better.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.173
Oh, good.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.871
I'm actually, uh,
feeling a little worse.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.786
What's up?

16:44.829 --> 16:47.223
Well, uh, we've been
looking into old cases,

16:47.267 --> 16:49.008
trying to put together
a canvas of potential suspects.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.140
Uh, ones that don't
fall under the umbrella

16:51.184 --> 16:53.534
of North Side Nation and Serano.
Just covering our bases.

16:53.577 --> 16:56.232
All right.
- Anything worthwhile yet?
- No.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.060
Uh, hope soon.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.106
James, I know you.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.151
And I know right now
you're thinking every second

17:02.195 --> 17:03.544
that goes by
without finding this guy

17:03.587 --> 17:05.154
is one second closer
to him getting away.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.764
But that's not gonna happen.
We will find him.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.114
I know you will.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.855
I got to ask this
one more time.

17:10.899 --> 17:14.555
Is there anything else you
remember from the altercation?

17:14.598 --> 17:17.123
I know it's a long shot, but
- I-but I have to ask. And, uh,
- Man...

17:17.166 --> 17:19.734
by the way, we do have one lead.

17:19.777 --> 17:23.738
Or one name we can
cross off our ever-growing list.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.697
- Serano. Yeah.
- Really?

17:26.741 --> 17:28.656
Doesn't fit
his M.O.

17:28.699 --> 17:31.441
Even Stan couldn't
wrap his mind around that move.

17:33.530 --> 17:36.794
Stan... as in Stan Morrison?

17:36.838 --> 17:40.972
Yep. Okay, listen, I...No, hold up, hold up.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.670
I put you in charge

17:42.713 --> 17:45.020
and the first thing you do
is go running to Stan?

17:45.064 --> 17:48.676
His ties to Serano
made him the only access

17:48.719 --> 17:50.025
- we could connect with.
- And did you believe a damn word

17:50.069 --> 17:51.200
that came out of
that man's mouth?

17:51.244 --> 17:52.854
Walker, he's on
the outs with Serano,

17:52.897 --> 17:55.770
he's got eyes all over him.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.119
Even if he
could help,

17:57.163 --> 17:58.425
why would he?
I mean, he's... it's...

17:58.468 --> 17:59.774
it'd be a death sentence.

17:59.817 --> 18:00.862
You think I wanted
to go see him?

18:00.905 --> 18:02.777
It wasn't just about
Stan's allegiance

18:02.820 --> 18:04.474
to Serano. It was
about his connections.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.783
Look, I know I was only your
first choice on a technicality.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.306
No. Don't do that.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.568
But your first choice
ain't here.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.048
When you
put me in charge,

18:13.092 --> 18:15.659
you were putting me in charge.
Of everything.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.139
No questions asked.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.316
And I'm here now, all right?
And I'm doing my best.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.145
I'm fine. I'm-I'm...

18:25.234 --> 18:26.409
James?

18:29.586 --> 18:31.849
Help. Help!
James.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.634
He-he, uh...Check the line.

18:34.678 --> 18:35.897
O2's dropping into the 70s.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.464
Get the crash cart.

18:37.507 --> 18:38.465
Damn it.
We need to bag him.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.031
James.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.252
Clear the line.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.471
- Ambu bag.
- Code 313.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.689
Code 313.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.169
- Sir, you need to move.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.040
Pulse is thready.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.092
We're dealing with a secondary
infection that has escalated

18:57.136 --> 19:01.052
to a point it caused sepsis.
That is what we're treating now.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.053
But he's gonna be okay?

19:03.577 --> 19:05.709
It is too soon
to know for sure.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.233
We're treating him
with the best drugs

19:07.276 --> 19:09.191
we have.
It's important he avoids

19:09.235 --> 19:10.149
any unnecessary stress.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.501
The next 12 hours
will be crucial.

19:14.544 --> 19:17.895
Thank you, Doctor.
Appreciate that.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.202
I just don't understand.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.509
What the hell is sepsis?

19:22.552 --> 19:24.206
All right, uh...

19:24.250 --> 19:26.513
your immune systemis like

19:26.556 --> 19:28.428
a home security network.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.125
Usually, when you've
got an intruder,

19:30.169 --> 19:31.996
boom-- an alarm goes off

19:32.040 --> 19:33.998
and security
takes care of it for you.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.218
But sometimes,
like in sepsis,

19:36.262 --> 19:38.220
instead of
taking it out...

19:41.267 --> 19:43.834
...security burns
the whole damn house down.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.273
Yeah, uh, but

19:47.316 --> 19:49.753
that doesn't mean,
uh, that doesn't mean

19:49.797 --> 19:52.408
anything about James.
He's gonna be all right.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.236
James isn't done.
He ain't done.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.369
Not by a thousand miles.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.634
DJ.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.462
Your daddy--

20:02.505 --> 20:05.334
he's gonna get through this.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.597
There's no other, uh,

20:07.641 --> 20:09.295
outcome that
makes any sense.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.514
Meantime, we
all just need

20:11.558 --> 20:13.560
to be there for
each another.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.431
And I will do whatever it takes

20:15.475 --> 20:18.304
to make sure whoever
is responsible for this

20:18.347 --> 20:21.045
is brought to justice.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.134
You have my word.

20:29.576 --> 20:32.622
Hey. I want to help.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.581
I know you do.

20:34.624 --> 20:37.279
I appreciate that,
but you're not

20:37.323 --> 20:39.586
- an A.D.
- A anymore.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.893
And that's fine, 'cause
you can still help, all right?

20:42.937 --> 20:45.026
The best way you can help
is to be there

20:45.069 --> 20:46.897
for them. Make
sure they all know

20:46.941 --> 20:49.248
they're not alone.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.643
Okay.

20:53.687 --> 20:56.167
But... but what about you?

20:56.211 --> 20:57.734
I'm all right.

20:59.214 --> 21:00.520
I got work to do.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.227
Walker.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.274
Hey. Hey.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.841
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:20.888 --> 21:22.498
I'm just, uh...

21:22.542 --> 21:24.979
...I'm heading to, uh, HQ.

21:25.022 --> 21:27.024
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I, um...

21:28.374 --> 21:31.072
Just... I-I just...
- taking a second, you know.
- Yeah.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.422
To-to... to think about...

21:33.466 --> 21:37.078
uh, everything.

21:39.472 --> 21:41.778
I'm out of my league here, Ger.

21:43.606 --> 21:47.349
Well, you're used to
the dark and scary.

21:47.393 --> 21:50.178
You are.
Between Em

21:50.221 --> 21:52.702
and Hoyt, the Wests.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.270
I... Even Micki.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.055
You thrive in that
chaos, you just...

21:58.099 --> 22:00.493
you always second-
- guess yourself.
- Well, but...

22:00.536 --> 22:04.061
this is different, Ger.
I mean, the-the...

22:04.105 --> 22:05.715
You know, I'm always
used to having somebody

22:05.759 --> 22:07.369
by my side, you know, somebody

22:07.413 --> 22:09.240
to look to for-for guidance.
And now Micki

22:09.284 --> 22:12.243
is-is...

22:12.287 --> 22:14.245
And Captain James is

22:14.289 --> 22:16.770
in there, and-and now
I have to go talk to...

22:16.813 --> 22:18.293
all the rangers--

22:18.337 --> 22:21.122
all of his rangers--

22:21.165 --> 22:23.211
a-and tell them what's going on.

22:23.254 --> 22:26.257
And everybody's gonna
be looking to me for-for answers

22:26.301 --> 22:29.739
and-and I don't have them.
You know, I-I...

22:31.785 --> 22:33.047
I don't think I can do it.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.659
Well, you're
already doing it.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.922
And you've got more
people on your side

22:38.966 --> 22:40.663
than you even know.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.449
It just looks a little
differently than you're used to.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.015
Yeah.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.105
You ever wonder why
it's always me and you

22:48.149 --> 22:49.846
- at the end of the world?
- Uh...

22:49.890 --> 22:52.719
Oh, God.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.068
You got this, Cordi.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.939
- Yeah.
- Come here.

22:57.201 --> 22:59.769
Go get 'em, Cordi.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.425
Yeah, of course.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.427
- You got it.
- Yeah.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.479
<i>Hey, can I get you guys</i>

23:13.522 --> 23:14.697
in the bullpen, please?

23:14.741 --> 23:16.830
Thank you.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.051
All right. Excuse me.
We can turn that off.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.401
We can turn...

23:22.444 --> 23:24.228
Rangers, friends.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.753
Uh, just a moment, please.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.842
So, the further
we look into the incident

23:28.885 --> 23:31.453
with Captain James,
the more it becomes clear

23:31.497 --> 23:34.804
that this was likely personal.
A crime of passion.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.719
This wasn't random.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.418
James was the target.
So, please

23:39.461 --> 23:41.681
keep trekking down memory lane,
because every old case

23:41.724 --> 23:43.900
could hold a potential suspect.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.728
All right.

23:45.772 --> 23:46.903
Uh, actually, actually,
uh, sorry.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.427
One more thing. Um...

23:51.560 --> 23:55.303
James is in a really rough spot.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.394
I can't promise you
everything will be okay.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.529
But I did promise him

24:03.572 --> 24:05.618
that we would get this job done.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.315
James asked me

24:07.358 --> 24:08.882
to call the shots for us,

24:08.925 --> 24:10.884
which means...

24:12.015 --> 24:13.495
...now I have this.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.804
Which, uh,
doesn't feel like it means

24:17.847 --> 24:19.588
a whole hell of a lot,
because the star's

24:19.632 --> 24:22.678
only as good as the person
wearing it, right?

24:22.722 --> 24:25.246
And, right now,
the person wearing it

24:25.289 --> 24:27.640
is a little nervous.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.425
Uh... well, scared, frankly.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.514
And I imagine some of y'all
might be scared, too.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.603
But that's okay.
We can

24:34.647 --> 24:36.562
use it as fuel.

24:36.605 --> 24:39.042
I been asking myself, uh...

24:39.086 --> 24:40.653
what would James do?

24:42.959 --> 24:45.005
Right now, I think
he'd be telling us to do

24:45.048 --> 24:47.834
whatever it takes
- to find this guy,
- Ada.

24:47.877 --> 24:50.358
- and find this guy we will.
- I need you
to get me a visitor pass.

24:50.401 --> 24:51.359
And when we do

24:51.402 --> 24:53.013
find him-- whoever he is--

24:53.056 --> 24:56.233
I need you all to ask youselves

24:56.277 --> 24:58.801
what would James do?

24:58.845 --> 25:00.586
We can honor him

25:00.629 --> 25:03.676
by bringing about
justice morally.

25:07.070 --> 25:08.550
I'll be working from HQ
for the next few hours,

25:08.594 --> 25:10.334
so I'm here if you need me.

25:10.378 --> 25:12.075
However you need me.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.469
So, take care of yourselves.
We got work to do.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.731
Will do.
- Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.175
Do you guys ever just wish

25:25.219 --> 25:28.309
your dads had a regular job?

25:28.352 --> 25:29.702
I used to.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.531
But, um, no, not anymore.

25:32.574 --> 25:33.967
You know, even after
everything that's happened,

25:34.010 --> 25:35.490
it just kind of makes sense,
you know?

25:35.534 --> 25:36.491
Plus, can you imagine

25:36.535 --> 25:37.927
my dad with a briefcase?

25:37.971 --> 25:39.799
Ridiculous.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.237
Yeah. I mean, I guess I know

25:43.280 --> 25:44.717
he's where he's
supposed to be, but

25:44.760 --> 25:47.589
sometimes I just wish
I could press pause.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.637
- Ow.
- Hey, do you guys

25:51.680 --> 25:53.595
remember the sleepovers

25:53.639 --> 25:56.642
- we used to have as kids?
- Yeah. Yeah, the-the
poker nights, right?

25:56.685 --> 25:59.079
The parents
were always so loud.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.472
And you used to get us caught
by sneaking down

26:01.516 --> 26:02.778
to watch
'em play.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.084
I was just trying to learn.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.128
By blowing our cover.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.347
It was pretty smart.

26:10.090 --> 26:13.136
We didn't learn the rules,
- but we came up with our own.
- Oh, my God.

26:13.180 --> 26:14.964
Oh...We even

26:15.008 --> 26:16.487
had our own chip system.

26:16.531 --> 26:18.881
So we played
with Rainbow Snaps.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.277
I can't press

26:23.320 --> 26:25.714
pause for you.
But

26:25.758 --> 26:28.674
maybe we could pretend
for a little while.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.027
I'll get cards
from the gift shop.

26:40.250 --> 26:43.340
Liam. Hey. You hear the news?
James is awake.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.691
That's great news.
Where are you?

26:45.734 --> 26:47.040
About to leave

26:47.083 --> 26:49.390
HQ and head back
to the hospital. What's up?

26:49.433 --> 26:51.653
Well, I looked into
some of those leads,

26:51.697 --> 26:53.481
and it turns out
there is a guy--

26:53.524 --> 26:57.050
recently released-- who was
cozying up to Serano's crew.

26:57.093 --> 26:58.486
Where'd you get all this?

26:58.529 --> 27:00.662
I may be a disgraced
- former A.D.
- A,

27:00.706 --> 27:02.142
but I still have
some friends there, okay?

27:02.185 --> 27:04.405
This guy, Cole Lecher--

27:04.448 --> 27:06.842
he was booked by James
back in his trooper days.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.844
- Okay.
- He was taken

27:08.888 --> 27:12.413
to Austin General Hospital
a few hours after James.

27:12.456 --> 27:13.893
For a gunshot wound?

27:13.936 --> 27:15.285
I mean, how-how
did we miss that?

27:15.329 --> 27:16.547
Car accident.

27:16.591 --> 27:17.984
Allegedly faulty breaks.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.202
His face got
all chopped up with glass.

27:19.246 --> 27:20.856
Look, I'm not a betting man,

27:20.900 --> 27:22.771
but I'd be willing to put money
on that accident being

27:22.815 --> 27:25.687
more than just a coincidence
if we checked it out.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.254
On my way.

27:40.049 --> 27:42.269
Hey, Jack?

27:42.312 --> 27:44.271
Mind giving me a hand with this?

27:44.314 --> 27:46.316
I'm trying to suss out a theory.

27:49.232 --> 27:50.712
You can say no. I...

27:54.281 --> 27:55.369
Do I know you?

28:01.331 --> 28:03.464
Jack.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.596
Cole Lecher.
36 years old, white male,

28:05.640 --> 28:07.947
dirty-blonde hair, blue eyes.
Slim build.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.732
No idea if he's armed, but we
know damn well he's dangerous.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.560
We've got tactical teams
at the ready if we need them,

28:12.603 --> 28:14.214
but Trooper Adams
is still on guard.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.302
The Captain
should be safe.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.912
I'll pound the alarm.
Good luck.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.479
Thanks.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.394
Does a broken taillight

28:20.437 --> 28:22.744
seem worth
all this?

28:22.788 --> 28:25.442
It can't be.
I was just

28:25.486 --> 28:26.748
trying to get home
to my kid,

28:26.792 --> 28:28.271
man.

28:28.315 --> 28:31.100
Hands in the sky!
Get on your knees!

28:31.144 --> 28:33.320
Walker. Walker, stand down.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.846
We're just...
we're just catching up.

28:37.890 --> 28:40.588
- Yeah? Just catching up,
just two old pals?

28:40.631 --> 28:42.155
Cole,

28:42.198 --> 28:43.373
what happened to the guard?

28:43.417 --> 28:44.984
He'll survive.

28:45.027 --> 28:47.116
I just needed a moment
with your captain.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.727
Walker.

28:48.770 --> 28:49.989
Put it down.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.646
Cole, don't worry
about him, okay?

28:55.690 --> 28:58.519
It's just the two of us here,
all right?

28:58.562 --> 29:00.347
You said everything
was gonna be fine.

29:02.131 --> 29:03.524
You lied.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.961
I...

29:06.005 --> 29:08.311
I didn't lie.

29:08.355 --> 29:11.227
My supervisor showed up,
I had no choice.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.708
Afterwards, I talked to the
judge, I asked for leniency,

29:13.752 --> 29:15.884
but at that point, I...

29:15.928 --> 29:17.843
It was out of my hands.

29:20.584 --> 29:24.284
I was in there three months
when a guy jumped me.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.895
I fought back.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.594
Got 15 for manslaughter.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.379
Cole,

29:32.422 --> 29:33.772
for what it's worth,

29:33.815 --> 29:35.904
I'm truly sorry.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.733
What happened to you
shouldn't happen.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.735
And it made me realize

29:40.779 --> 29:42.868
that I didn't want to
do things that way.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.304
And in order to do that,

29:44.347 --> 29:46.088
I had to be the one
calling the shots.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.394
I had to be the one

29:47.437 --> 29:50.179
weighing those
decisions.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.138
Just trying to do what's right.

29:52.181 --> 29:54.009
Like how
this big Serano case

29:54.053 --> 29:56.272
brought a lot of attention
onto you.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.405
And that's what
gave me an opening.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.105
But then you survived.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.499
That's not right.

30:05.542 --> 30:06.456
Don't!

30:06.500 --> 30:07.893
- Drop your gun!
- No. Both of you,

30:07.936 --> 30:09.808
put your damn guns down!

30:09.851 --> 30:11.635
Now!

30:11.679 --> 30:13.376
Walker.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.074
You made me a promise, man.

30:15.117 --> 30:17.032
Put your gun down.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.820
Cole.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.822
I'm gonna need you
to go first, here, pal.

30:25.562 --> 30:27.608
Cole, listen to me.

30:27.651 --> 30:30.567
No one is gonna die here today.

30:30.611 --> 30:33.179
All right?

30:37.487 --> 30:41.317
Your anger's justified, it is.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.886
And I know, right
now, it seems...

31:00.771 --> 31:02.208
Why?

31:02.251 --> 31:04.950
I was just doing my job.

31:15.917 --> 31:18.180
<i>So, I know your job is to</i>

31:18.224 --> 31:20.530
take on the thing that
goes bump in the night.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.142
Like a Black Batman
or something.

31:23.185 --> 31:26.493
But I think that...

31:26.536 --> 31:29.757
we could all use a little bit
of a break from this.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.367
So...

31:31.411 --> 31:33.065
So, Idaho.

31:33.108 --> 31:35.241
Boys weekend at Boise?

31:35.284 --> 31:37.417
I like the sound of that.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.422
Come here, dude.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.471
I love you.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.517
I love you too.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.563
- Love you.
- I love you too.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.871
All right. Well,

31:56.915 --> 31:59.265
I will call
as soon as I get home.

31:59.308 --> 32:00.614
- Yes, you will.
- I promise.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.224
- All right.
- All right. Bye, baby.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.923
- Be safe.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.797
Let me walk you out.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.799
I thought I had someone

32:11.842 --> 32:14.933
who would kind of be by
my side through all this.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.326
You know, take over for me.

32:17.370 --> 32:18.588
Someone I trusted.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.025
You don't mean...No.

32:20.068 --> 32:22.375
No, no, no. I'm talking
about Micki Ramirez.

32:22.418 --> 32:24.899
She was a Ranger.
- Damn good one.
- Mm-hmm.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.641
Felt like I had the weight
of the world on my shoulders.

32:27.684 --> 32:29.643
When she arrived, I...

32:29.686 --> 32:32.254
had her take on some
of that burden too.

32:32.298 --> 32:35.257
- Who's gonna do that now?
- I don't know. That's
what I'm saying. I mean,

32:35.301 --> 32:37.607
I don't-I don't think it can
be just one or two people.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.915
I'm really trying to change
things around here, but...

32:40.959 --> 32:42.438
I'm gonna need help.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.573
The last time
that we really talked,

32:46.616 --> 32:47.922
you thought I was
leaving because

32:47.966 --> 32:49.968
you were married to the job.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.101
Yeah.

32:57.671 --> 33:01.327
My worst fear was that one
night you wouldn't come home.

33:01.370 --> 33:03.633
And it came true.

33:03.677 --> 33:06.027
You stopped coming home
a long time ago,

33:06.071 --> 33:08.160
at least in any way
that really mattered.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.596
You were so focused

33:09.639 --> 33:12.207
on protecting us
and everyone else that

33:12.251 --> 33:14.079
you forgot to
let people in.

33:14.122 --> 33:16.037
Let me in.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.561
I mean, everything I...No, no. It wasn't
always like that.

33:18.605 --> 33:21.738
Once you got on
that captain track--

33:21.782 --> 33:23.523
that's when we
started to lose you.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.484
Why didn't you say something?

33:28.528 --> 33:30.051
I did.

33:30.095 --> 33:31.835
You just couldn't hear me.

33:31.879 --> 33:34.142
- But you can now.
- And that

33:34.186 --> 33:36.666
counts for a whole
hell of a lot.

33:38.277 --> 33:41.889
Um... you know, you still have
me as your emergency contact.

33:41.932 --> 33:44.457
You don't have to
change it. But, um,

33:44.500 --> 33:47.764
maybe just try calling
when the sky isn't falling.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.637
I'll see what I can do.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.421
Okay.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.467
Bye, babe.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.526
Bye.

34:17.403 --> 34:20.797
As I told the immediate family,
after irrigating the laceration

34:20.841 --> 34:23.322
and administering vancomyacin,
there are no longer signs

34:23.365 --> 34:27.065
of infection. He should
be discharged tomorrow.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.067
I'll call Mawline
with the news.

34:31.895 --> 34:35.377
You should know, that
68 Whiskey came through.

34:35.421 --> 34:37.771
You saved the
man's life.

34:37.814 --> 34:40.295
I appreciate that, Doctor.

34:40.339 --> 34:43.037
Those instincts
just don't go away.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.647
Yeah, I guess so.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.694
You know, I haven't
seen you since, uh...

34:51.001 --> 34:52.742
Well, look, I just
wanted to apologize.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.179
I let-I let the cat
out of the bag

34:54.222 --> 34:56.398
- and it wasn't my place.
- Whoa, whoa.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.965
Ah.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.795
Nah. Look, that's...
that's not on you.

35:01.838 --> 35:05.059
Garrison was just the
tip of the iceberg.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.409
Sometimes love just
isn't enough, you know?

35:07.453 --> 35:09.150
And this stuff with James--

35:09.194 --> 35:10.847
it nailed down a lot
of things for me.

35:10.891 --> 35:13.546
I'm good in a crisis, yeah.

35:13.589 --> 35:15.200
I mean, that's
for damn sure, but...

35:15.243 --> 35:18.116
that's not the life
that I want to live.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.815
I'm on the right path now,

35:21.858 --> 35:25.688
even if the universe
keeps trying to,

35:25.732 --> 35:29.866
I don't know, test it.

35:29.910 --> 35:32.608
You know, when I returned home
from the service, I...

35:34.219 --> 35:38.048
God, I felt like I was
living a different life.

35:39.441 --> 35:42.401
Then I met Abby.
And I returned to the ranch.

35:42.444 --> 35:43.880
And there's been a lot
of ups and a lot of downs

35:43.924 --> 35:45.621
since then, but...

35:45.665 --> 35:48.711
you know, those bad things--
they're gonna happen.

35:48.755 --> 35:51.584
And for better or for worse,
going through 'em

35:51.627 --> 35:53.673
tends to bring us together.

35:53.716 --> 35:55.675
And, for that...

35:55.718 --> 35:57.633
I'm grateful.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.157
Yeah.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.942
You know, the ranch
has been a crime scene

36:01.985 --> 36:03.683
more times than I can count,

36:03.726 --> 36:07.426
but slightly less, recently,
than your house.

36:11.038 --> 36:13.780
You'll always have a place
to land if you need it.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.000
A home.

36:18.132 --> 36:19.351
Thank you.

36:20.482 --> 36:21.701
Thank you.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.703
Yes, sir.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.923
Ah...

36:26.967 --> 36:29.361
Just doing my job.

36:29.404 --> 36:31.841
Just following orders.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.279
I mean, I-I... you know,
I get it. I've said it.

36:34.322 --> 36:37.325
But... time and time again,

36:37.369 --> 36:40.241
- those words cause devastation.
- Yeah.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.983
And it's not enough
to just be in charge.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.245
Not anymore.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.856
Well, Cap...

36:48.467 --> 36:49.946
...you're doing a great job.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.514
No, I'm not. I mean,
I-I could be.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.647
Been so focused on
calling the right shots,

36:54.690 --> 36:56.431
but that's just
a piece of it.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.172
It also matters who's
receiving those orders.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.262
It's got to be someone that
can make the right choice,

37:01.306 --> 37:03.960
- regardless of protocol.
- Of course.

37:04.004 --> 37:05.614
About yesterday, I-I...No. We're not even

37:05.658 --> 37:07.225
getting into that.
You made the right call.

37:07.268 --> 37:10.271
You listened to me
over protocol,

37:10.315 --> 37:13.622
over the instincts that
have been drilled into you.

37:13.666 --> 37:16.190
I...

37:16.234 --> 37:18.105
I don't know,
I'm just saying...

37:18.148 --> 37:21.369
sometimes there are ways
to stop violence that don't

37:21.413 --> 37:24.633
bring about more violence.
More death.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.983
But it's not just
about one or two

37:27.027 --> 37:28.550
or a dozen people

37:28.594 --> 37:30.987
- understanding that.
- Cap, you...
For whatever it's worth,

37:31.031 --> 37:34.861
you got me. A-And I'm not the
same Ranger I was a year ago.

37:34.904 --> 37:36.471
I mean, hell,
I'm-I'm not-I'm not

37:36.515 --> 37:38.517
the Ranger I was a day ago.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.433
And as flattering as it was

37:41.476 --> 37:45.045
to step into your shoes
for a little bit...

37:45.088 --> 37:47.482
it-it taught me a lot.

37:47.526 --> 37:49.745
All right,
give it to me.

37:49.789 --> 37:53.445
All right. Uh...
permission to speak freely.

37:53.488 --> 37:54.968
Permission granted.

37:56.186 --> 37:59.189
those are, uh,
some big shoes to fill.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.626
Uh, pardon the pun.

38:00.669 --> 38:03.411
But, two--
and-and more importantly--

38:03.455 --> 38:04.630
um...

38:04.673 --> 38:08.373
I realized that's-that's
not what I want.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.723
Look...

38:10.766 --> 38:12.551
about before, I'm sorry. I...No, no, no, no.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.379
Don't do... Don't be sor...
You were right

38:14.422 --> 38:16.119
to say that.
You meant it. And, uh,

38:16.163 --> 38:19.514
I-I needed to hear it,
you know. I needed to get that

38:19.558 --> 38:22.212
kick in the ass.
But I know now that

38:22.256 --> 38:26.304
I don't want to be the one
calling the shots.

38:26.347 --> 38:29.481
I can't do what you do.
I...

38:29.524 --> 38:33.441
want to be the one
who answers that call.

38:33.485 --> 38:35.356
Good, 'cause I'm
gonna need you.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.923
You got me.

38:36.966 --> 38:39.621
Losing Micki has thrown
us both for a loop.

38:39.665 --> 38:40.622
I mean, you even more so.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.711
She was your
partner. But

38:42.755 --> 38:44.322
we need more Mickis.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.977
Maybe even a few
more Cordells.

38:48.021 --> 38:50.023
You sure you can handle that?

38:50.066 --> 38:51.459
A few more. A few more.

38:51.503 --> 38:54.375
I mean... gonna be hard to find.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.250
- So, what-- that's it?
- No,

39:00.294 --> 39:01.730
but it's a start.

39:01.774 --> 39:03.863
Recruit, train, retrain.

39:03.906 --> 39:06.909
Wash, rinse, repeat.

39:06.953 --> 39:09.390
- Sounds like we got work to do.
- Yeah, we do.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.610
And we'll do it.
Together.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.918
All right.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.281
Well, I take it this means

39:31.325 --> 39:33.153
I stuck my neck out
for more than

39:33.196 --> 39:36.243
- just a jailhouse rumor.
- Part of the deal, remember?

39:36.286 --> 39:38.767
Good intel, one visit.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.772
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.818
So, what do
you want?

39:49.387 --> 39:53.652
Well... I wrote you a letter.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.610
I never heard back.

39:55.654 --> 39:58.439
I wasn't in the market
for a pen pal.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.572
But you know
there's a whole demographic

40:00.615 --> 40:03.226
of people who get their
rocks off marrying murderers

40:03.270 --> 40:04.706
behind bars.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.969
Yeah, you have changed.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.233
It's hard not to.

40:10.277 --> 40:13.367
Yeah, I know.
Careful, it's a slippery slope.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.153
I'm here, you know,
if you need someone to talk to.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.721
After what you did?
It goes beyond

40:19.765 --> 40:23.421
the realm of forgiveness.

40:23.464 --> 40:25.858
After today,
you'll never see me again.

40:25.901 --> 40:28.295
If you say so.

40:28.338 --> 40:30.515
Heard about what happened
in Thalia.

40:33.039 --> 40:35.041
You know, you were right
about the Davidsons.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.915
There was always something

40:39.959 --> 40:43.005
about Gale that
didn't sit right with me.

40:43.049 --> 40:45.617
At first I thought it was just
'cause she was so nasty to Abby.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.445
But then things
started to change.

40:47.488 --> 40:50.404
There was so much loss.
This is even before Marv.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.841
Stan, if you're...

40:52.885 --> 40:54.408
doing this
to mess with my head, I...

40:54.452 --> 40:57.150
You know I represented
your family after the fire?

40:58.456 --> 41:01.633
Not the flashy stuff,
but the boring side.

41:01.676 --> 41:05.158
Land disputes and...

41:05.201 --> 41:06.594
other matters.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.861
Esme still
looks after my property.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.559
She'll let you in.

41:14.602 --> 41:17.431
There's a desk
in the living room.

41:17.475 --> 41:20.216
It has one of those
false bottoms.

41:20.260 --> 41:21.914
You'll, uh, find something

41:21.957 --> 41:24.003
you might need in those
old files there.

41:24.046 --> 41:26.135
And that would be...

41:26.179 --> 41:29.356
You'll know when you see it.

41:31.227 --> 41:32.490
And, listen...

41:33.882 --> 41:35.884
while you're rummaging
around in the past there,

41:35.928 --> 41:37.973
just keep in mind...

41:38.017 --> 41:40.541
you might not always
like what you find.
