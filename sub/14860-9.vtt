(AMPLIFIED VOICE)
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:03.629 --> 00:04.619
friends and family,

00:04.922 --> 00:06.458
pity invitees,

00:06.757 --> 00:10.295
are you ready to get
your bar mitzvah on?

00:10.594 --> 00:13.336
Well, then please join me
in welcoming to the stage,

00:13.639 --> 00:16.506
he entered a boy
but will be leaving a...

00:16.808 --> 00:18.094
"Entered a boy"
doesn't sound great.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.885
He came in a...
Still not great.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.772
Let's just welcome to the
stage, Mr. Benjamin Feldman!

00:25.067 --> 00:26.182
(CHEERING)

00:28.278 --> 00:31.316
So, Max is a
bar mitzvah emcee now?

00:31.615 --> 00:34.323
| think they prefer to be
called bar mitzvah hype guys.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.780
| believe it's pronounced
chype guys.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.070
| did not know
that this was a job.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.329
Well, Max leads the
league in having jobs

00:40.624 --> 00:41.489
you didn't know were jobs. Mmm.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.282
Remember when he was
a salad bar back?

00:43.585 --> 00:45.826
Yeah, that was right before
he was a funeral seat filler.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.210
(CRYING) Oh, Kevin.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.082
(SNIFFLES) Oh,
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.171
(SNIFFLES)

00:54.304 --> 00:55.419
(WHISPERS
INDISTINCTLY)

00:55.722 --> 00:56.962
(ORGAN PLAYING)

00:57.266 --> 00:58.222
Oh, Devin!

00:59.768 --> 01:01.554
Devin, Devin, Devin.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.140
Oh, Max is bad at
most things he does.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.646
| can't believe | gifted
him with my virginity.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.728
Oh. You know, he's
actually pretty great out there.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.813
Okay, everybody,
ready for the dreidel spin!

01:11.113 --> 01:14.481
J Tonight, tonight I

01:14.783 --> 01:16.490
Yeah!
Okay.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.526
Yes and yes
and yes and yes.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.945
(MOUTH FULL) Guys,
This food is so good.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.955
From now on,
Alex is keeping it kosh!

01:23.250 --> 01:24.661
Al, what are you doing?
Max said we could only come

01:24.960 --> 01:26.667
as long as we didn't eat
anything, talk to anyone,

01:26.962 --> 01:28.498
or flirt with the cute
rabbi who drives a Ferrari

01:28.797 --> 01:29.878
and chants
like a Jewish angel.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.538
You have done
all of those things.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.709
He drives a 'rari and
sings like a damn angel.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.925
Plus, I have always wanted
to marry a Jewish guy.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.884
They're just,
like, so cool,

01:40.183 --> 01:42.675
with their leather
jackets and their jeans

01:42.978 --> 01:44.184
and their ability to turn
jukeboxes on and off

01:44.479 --> 01:45.844
just by punching them.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.934
Okay, I'm just
describing The Fonz.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.815
You know, I always thought
I'd end up with a Jewish guy

01:50.110 --> 01:52.772
until I met
this chocolate anaconda.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.607
Ay! Oh!
Me?

01:54.906 --> 01:55.816
| think Brad's
out there.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.483
Oh! Whoa! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

01:58.785 --> 02:00.367
Whoa!
Whoa!

02:00.662 --> 02:02.869
(IMITATES HORSE BLUSTERING)

02:03.165 --> 02:04.496
You know, those two
are pretty good together.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.327
Speaking of good together, you know
what would be great with this blintz?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.243
Bacon.

02:08.544 --> 02:09.535
Al, if you're keeping it
kosh, you can't have bacon.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.044
Even on my cheat days?

02:11.340 --> 02:12.455
There are no cheat days.
Ham?

02:12.758 --> 02:14.123
Still, no.
Okay.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.383
| think I know the answer,
but what about bacon bits?

02:16.678 --> 02:17.884
It says bacon
in the name.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.887
You have
an eating disorder.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.092
Can I still stay friends
with my pig friends?

02:22.142 --> 02:24.133
Yes, of course.
Of course.

02:25.187 --> 02:25.972
Pig friends?

02:37.449 --> 02:38.735
(SCRUBBING) You and Dave
should come out with us tonight.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.571
Brad got tickets to one
of those hologram concerts.

02:41.870 --> 02:42.860
Hologram Graham Nash
is opening

02:43.163 --> 02:44.574
for Hologram Hall & Oates.

02:44.873 --> 02:45.658
Well, actually,
it's Hologram Hall,

02:45.957 --> 02:47.539
but real-live Oates.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.996
Uh, we'd love to, but we
kinda got a lot going on.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.956
Yeah.
| can see that.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.461
As a matter of fact,

02:53.757 --> 02:55.213
Dave and I have a pretty
juicy date night planned.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.715
Ooh!
Yeah.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.250
My fruit guy,
Farique, hooked us up

02:58.553 --> 02:59.884
with some next-level dates,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.841
So, we're gonna stay inside
and house those bad boys.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.715
Well, got to go dump out.

03:05.018 --> 03:05.928
(LAUGHS)

03:06.228 --> 03:06.968
Yes!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.137
So,

03:09.439 --> 03:10.520
seems like you and Dave
are getting comfortable again

03:10.816 --> 03:12.022
pretty quick. (LAUGHS)

03:12.317 --> 03:13.557
What's wrong with that?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.021
Pumpkin, I just don't
want things to end up

03:15.320 --> 03:17.027
the way they did
last time for you two.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.438
I'm worried you're falling
back into old patterns.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.697
| mean, you got to mix it up
a little, like Brad and I do.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.071
(CLICK)

03:23.370 --> 03:24.735
I'm gonna need to see
your license, registration,

03:25.038 --> 03:25.903
and proof of penis.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.537
This is outrageous.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.164
I'm writing down
your vag number.

03:29.459 --> 03:30.620
It's number one.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.034
Yeah, it is.

03:32.337 --> 03:32.917
(SIREN WHOOPING)
(LAUGHS)

03:33.213 --> 03:33.793
Ee! Oh, snap.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.376
It's the real po-po.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.506
Excuse me, miss.
Wait. Babe?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.166
Babe? Babe!
Miss?

03:39.469 --> 03:41.426
Turns out those cops
were just another couple,

03:41.722 --> 03:43.212
had their
own thing going on.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.597
Okay, I appreciate your
concern but Dave and I are fine.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.883
Okay, we've got plenty of
romance in our relationship.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.221
False alarm. (SIGHS)

03:49.521 --> 03:51.103
Oh, well. Something to
look forward to.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.480
Oh! Actually, false alarm
on the false alarm.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.106
See ya in 25 to 30.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.767
Yes!

03:58.447 --> 03:59.403
| get it. We're gross.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.280
Yeah.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.237
So you know
that super sweet guy

04:04.536 --> 04:05.822
| met at the bar mitzvah?
Mmm-hmm.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.737
Turns out he wasn't just
a little on the short side

04:08.039 --> 04:09.495
with a hipster mustache.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.998
He's 13 and actually
tall for his age.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.503
Oh, I guess 5772 isn't gonna
be the year of Penny, either.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.413
Why is he sending you
pictures of his teeth?

04:17.716 --> 04:19.172
Because he just got
his braces off.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.879
It's like, okay, Eli,
we get that you're fired up,

04:21.178 --> 04:22.168
but act like
you've been there.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.961
Mmm-hmm.
Speaking of bar mitzvahs,

04:24.264 --> 04:25.379
how awesome were
Max and I yesterday?

04:25.682 --> 04:26.843
Mmm!
(LAUGHS)

04:27.142 --> 04:29.133
| mean, people were hanging
On our every move.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.517
It was like a scene
out of Magic Mike, (LAUGHS)

04:30.812 --> 04:32.098
Not that I would know.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.353
(GASPS) Oh, my God.
| just had the best idea.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.433
Buy Magic Mike on Blu-ray?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.019
No. Well, maybe. But no.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.605
You two should team up and
hype bar mitzvahs together.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.486
(INHALES DEEPLY)
| don't know.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.896
| mean, I'd have to think
about it because I only

04:42.199 --> 04:43.564
really, really, really,
really, really wanna do it.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.403
Look, Brad,
you're a good kid,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.776
but I hype alone.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.616
Max, everyone at the party
was talking about you two.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.998
If you team up, | bet I
could get you a ton of work.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.500
You will be the hottest
mixed race dance crew

04:55.796 --> 04:56.957
since Paula Abdul
and MC Skat Kat.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.128
He was Persian.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.757
(SIGHS) Sure.
What the hell!

05:03.053 --> 05:04.669
(LAUGHS) Max!

05:04.971 --> 05:07.338
You beautiful bastard.
You will not regret it.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.302
But you are gonna
have to work.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.308
I'm talking early
mornings, late nights, Right.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.968
On-time afternoons.
Okay.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.386
You're gonna have to eat,
breathe, dream, and sleep... Right.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.020
...every single move
that I teach you,

05:16.316 --> 05:18.227
and then, even then

05:18.527 --> 05:19.392
| can't be assured
that you're gonna get it.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.395
(GRUNTS)

05:22.697 --> 05:24.438
Well, you got it.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.072
It's possible I oversold
how hard this would be.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.950
Yeah.
Oh, and check this out.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.735
I've been working on that
spin move you've been doing.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.279
Dreidel... No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:32.582 --> 05:34.164
That's my
signature move.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.575
No one does the Dreidel spin
except DJ Dikembe Mutombo.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.461
Wait. Why is your name
DJ Dikembe Mutombo?

05:39.756 --> 05:40.461
(IMITATES DIKEMBE MUTOMBO)
Because no one doesn't dance

05:40.757 --> 05:41.588
in Mutombo's house.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.337
(SIGHS)

05:44.636 --> 05:45.717
Not only do I love that,

05:46.012 --> 05:47.093
but it makes me hate
your regular voice

05:47.389 --> 05:48.049
and non-Mutombo
persona.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.214
(BOTH LAUGHING)

05:50.517 --> 05:51.052
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

05:53.353 --> 05:54.935
It's for his
older brother.

05:55.230 --> 05:55.970
The bar mitzvah
boy's older brother.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.354
What?
Ugh.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.640
Yeah. The minute
| said it, I realized,

05:59.943 --> 06:01.104
the older brother's gonna
wanna see more cleave.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.564
Um... Mmm-mmm.
Huh?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.399
BRAD: Uh...
Mmm.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.813
MAX: What is that move?
Ooh. Oh, boy.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.483
Just need the right angle.
It's all about the angle.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.652
MAX: Okay, well,
that's a rough angle.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.868
Hey, Al, I got some
pretty sick puzzles here!

06:15.166 --> 06:17.783
You wanna go with Amish
country, which is 300 pieces,

06:18.086 --> 06:20.202
or Mount Rushmore,
which is...

06:20.505 --> 06:22.416
...one piece?
| bought a place mat.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.296
Yoo-hoo.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.633
What you doing?

06:26.928 --> 06:28.669
| thought we could
repaint the room.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.758
And if that
happens to lead

06:31.057 --> 06:32.923
to us playfully flicking
paint at each other

06:33.226 --> 06:34.933
and then making passionate
love on the floor, then so be it.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.389
How long have you been
inhaling these paint fumes?

06:36.688 --> 06:37.769
Long enough.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.476
Okay. Just gonna
open a window.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.357
| think you should open
your pants window.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.234
Come on! Let's have fun!

06:44.529 --> 06:45.690
Ahhh!
(GASPS)

06:45.989 --> 06:46.649
Oh, God! It's in
my eyes! Oh! Ahhh!

06:46.948 --> 06:47.608
My lasiks!

06:48.199 --> 06:49.189
Oh!

06:49.492 --> 06:51.324
My Asics!

06:51.620 --> 06:52.735
(PAINT TRAY THUDS)
Wait! Come back!

06:53.038 --> 06:55.325
(SING-SONG) I also have
the pottery wheel from Ghost.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.035
(GROANS) Ooh.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.540
Maybe I should
open a window.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.291
Don't be shy. Daddy's
got to carbo load.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.372
WOMAN: Enjoy the
mashed potato.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.036
Maybe this
was a mistake.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.455
What if I can't
hype them up?

07:04.758 --> 07:05.748
What if they find out
I'm not Jewish?

07:06.051 --> 07:07.416
Dude, I told them
you were Ethiopian.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.802
And relax. White people
love black people.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.338
Why do you think we've been wholesale
ripping off your culture for decades?

07:13.642 --> 07:15.007
It's out of love.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.550
And greed.
But mostly love.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.433
(UNDER BREATH)
Of money.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.178

07:24.611 --> 07:25.396
It's time to put

You missed.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.958
J Tonight
(BOTH CHEERING)

07:50.261 --> 07:52.377
<i>On! Look at
that man move!</i>

07:52.681 --> 07:55.719
This is some good
material for the ol' buzz bank.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.384
You are not like other
married couples I see on TV.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.722
From the gentleman
at the bar.

08:00.021 --> 08:00.601
Ooh! (CHUCKLES)

08:01.314 --> 08:02.896
Oh! Hello.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.103
Not him. Him.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.066
Yeah, that makes
more sense.

08:11.866 --> 08:12.947
| don't get it.
What is it about me?

08:13.243 --> 08:15.359
| am like Jewish boy crack.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.778
Well, you're a goy with
vaguely Semitic looks

08:18.081 --> 08:19.617
who gives off
a real strong vibe

08:19.916 --> 08:21.748
that you know your way
around a Handrew Jackson.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.752
Jane! You're making
me blush! (LAUGHS)

08:26.047 --> 08:27.913
Ha! Yeah! (LAUGHS)
Ha! Ha! Ha!

08:28.842 --> 08:31.049
Good! Good! Good! Good!

08:31.344 --> 08:32.674
(AMPLIFIED VOICE) Ah! Ah! Good!

08:32.971 --> 08:33.551
| got a mashed
potato cramp.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.589
Oi! Oi
Ahhh!

08:36.890 --> 08:38.052
Excuse me. Party starter
coming through.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.385
BRAD: Yeah!
Phew!

08:39.686 --> 08:40.517
BRAD: Whoo!
(SIGHS)

08:41.479 --> 08:42.809
(GROANS)

08:43.106 --> 08:44.346
Okay, everybody,

08:44.649 --> 08:45.810
it's time for
the dreidel spin!

08:46.109 --> 08:47.770
Dreidel spin!

08:48.069 --> 08:49.434
Huh! Huh!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.111
Ahhh!
(CHEERING)

08:56.411 --> 08:57.492
(LAUGHS) Yes.

08:57.787 --> 08:58.618
Betrayal!

08:59.789 --> 09:01.200
Yeah! Yeah! (LAUGHS)

09:02.167 --> 09:03.407
(CHEERING CONTINUES)

09:07.547 --> 09:09.208
Hey, dude!

09:09.507 --> 09:10.747
Ooh. How are
the eyes doing?

09:11.676 --> 09:13.508
Not great.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.385
Not great, but the paint
incident did give me a chance

09:15.680 --> 09:17.296
to dust off
me old shades.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.760
Did the doctor
make you wear those?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.801
Um, yeah. Dr. Style.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.140
Okay, well, feast your
plastic covered eyes on this!

09:24.439 --> 09:26.851
| am whisking you away
for a romantic weekend.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.356
Oh, Al, I'd love to go,

09:28.651 --> 09:30.107
but tomorrow I'm getting
my goatee lined up.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.734
And right now,
I'm in the middle

09:32.030 --> 09:34.613
of responding to a bunch
of nasty reviews on Yelp.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.615
Come on, Dave, okay?
It's gonna be great.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.527
Look, I already
packed for you.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.287
Al all that's in here
is a travel Guess Who?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.368
And a terrifying
amount of condoms.

09:44.667 --> 09:45.407
They're for your penis.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.452
You didn't even
pack any clothes.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.621
Where we're going,
we don't need clothes.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.255
Actually, that's not true.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.711
Where we're going, we're
gonna need a lot of clothes

09:54.010 --> 09:55.250
'cause it's overrun
by Asian tiger mosquitoes.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.089
But we'll be together!

09:57.388 --> 09:59.425
Look, Al, I just think
we should do this

09:59.724 --> 10:01.886
when we can plan it out and
take advantage of travel deals.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.472
Oh! We could go to Florida
and stay with my nana.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.603
There is nothing sexy
about your nana.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.309
Mmm. She does all right.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.440
Ugh! Our love is dead!

10:12.946 --> 10:14.937
What's happening?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.322
What's happening is she thinks
you're falling back into your old patterns,

10:17.617 --> 10:19.654
and that the romance is already
gone from your relationship.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.409
Yeah. What am
| gonna do?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.411
Yeah! Give me
a minute to think.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.912
What are those two
talking about?

10:25.208 --> 10:26.323
| don't know. They got their
own thing going on this week.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.787
So, let me
get this straight.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.952
You want me to hype
a bar mitzvah without Max?

10:30.255 --> 10:33.589
Not me. My client, former alderman
Larry Umansky. No big deal.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.124
Really not.
In certain circles.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.964
He saw you perform
last week and he flipped.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.972
Only catch is, he just
wants you, not Max.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.928
Ooh! (EXHALES DEEPLY)

10:44.227 --> 10:45.809
Boyz || Menorah
is a team.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.469
You saw him cramp up
during the hora.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.638
And he was nowhere to be
found when Shout came on.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.557
No one could get even
the slightest bit louder,

10:51.860 --> 10:53.771
and at no point could
anyone get at all softer.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.686
It was an
even-keeled disaster.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.855
| can't hype without Max.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.490
Fine, but just in case
you change your mind,

11:00.785 --> 11:02.492
8:00.
Am Shalom temple.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.369
Destiny awaits.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.826
Destiny Umansky,
Larry's wife.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.332
She'll be your contact
on all things related

11:09.627 --> 11:11.368
to Jake's rockin'
bar mitzvah.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.332
Okay, you got to
do something big.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.871
What is some place that Alex
has always wanted to visit?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.290
Smurf village.
Real place.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.129
Paris. But honestly,
that is a distant second.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.669
| think I've got it.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.088
We do a whisk-away,

11:23.391 --> 11:25.382
but instead of whisking
Alex to Paris,

11:25.685 --> 11:29.144
we whisk Paris
to Alex. (LAUGHS)

11:29.439 --> 11:31.476
We can set up your
courtyard like a Parisian bistro.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.936
| can even make
fake plane tickets

11:34.235 --> 11:34.849
and wear
a stewardess outfit.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.234
That sounds amazing,

11:36.529 --> 11:38.361
but why would you wear
a stewardess outfit?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.146
Well, either that or I'm
gonna need to change.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.406
Um...

11:41.701 --> 11:43.032
She's the
sexy stewardess,

11:43.328 --> 11:44.944
and I'm the melancholy
frequent flyer

11:45.246 --> 11:47.237
whose entire life can fit
in an overhead compartment.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.405
(CLICK)

11:48.708 --> 11:49.823
BRAD: Ahhh!
Mmm!

11:50.126 --> 11:51.662
Should've called ahead.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.872
| did call ahead, and apparently
it did not make a difference.

11:54.172 --> 11:54.957
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

11:55.256 --> 11:56.587
Max? Can I talk to you?

11:58.301 --> 11:59.041
Um...

12:00.178 --> 12:00.963
What are you doing?

12:01.262 --> 12:02.844
(GRUNTS)

12:03.139 --> 12:04.675
I'm trying to find a dunkaroo
| dropped under the couch,

12:04.974 --> 12:06.635
and I got to get it
before the rats do,

12:06.935 --> 12:09.267
because I will not spend
another Thursday

12:09.562 --> 12:11.599
fighting a rat
for what is rightfully mine!

12:11.898 --> 12:13.605
Do you hear me, rat?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.061
Although, you'd probably
take the rat's side, wouldn't you?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.270
Well, depends on the rat.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.651
You stole my move, Brad!

12:18.947 --> 12:20.858
You knew the dreidel spin
was my thing. You did it anyway.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.397
Look, dude, I'm sorry
about the move.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.190
But I had to do something.
You weren't there.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.700
Oh, come on.
Look,

12:25.995 --> 12:27.326
if we just take it
more seriously

12:27.622 --> 12:28.987
and we're, like, a little
more professional, I think...

12:29.290 --> 12:31.406
Oh, you're gonna talk to
me about being professional?

12:31.709 --> 12:33.916
Me? The guy who took an
online class in bar mitzvah hype?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.753
That I created...

12:37.048 --> 12:38.209
And paid for
with Dave's credit card.

12:38.508 --> 12:39.714
Didn't you fail that?

12:40.009 --> 12:42.250
Those exams
are racially biased!

12:42.553 --> 12:44.965
When I met you, you
were nothin'. (SCOFFS)

12:45.265 --> 12:47.632
You were out on the street, doing
underpants stuff for soup money.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.220
| made you.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.351
Well, you know what?
I'm done.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.728
Yeah? Maybe Boyz [I Menorah
is done. Well, maybe it is!

12:54.023 --> 12:55.639
Well, then maybe we have
nothing left to talk about. Shalom!

12:57.193 --> 12:58.558
Wait. Doesn't that
also mean "Hello"?

12:58.861 --> 12:59.942
| said shalom, sir!

13:04.409 --> 13:05.820
(DIALING)

13:06.119 --> 13:07.405
Hello, Destiny?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.194
| think we have
a date tonight.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.113
Oh, no, no. Not a real date.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.032
No, it's Brad.
The bar mitzvah guy?

13:13.334 --> 13:14.495
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

13:14.794 --> 13:15.659
(DEEP VOICE) I'm in.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.293
(BEEP)

13:17.588 --> 13:19.078
Wow! This is amazing.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.255
| know. I know.

13:21.551 --> 13:22.712
The only thing
missing is Alex.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.547
She should've been
here by now.

13:24.846 --> 13:25.677
Well, maybe her store
was really busy.

13:25.972 --> 13:26.677
Mmm.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.805
(BOTH LAUGH)

13:31.644 --> 13:33.260
Oh!

13:33.563 --> 13:35.099
Just imagine it
really busy. Just try. Ah!

13:35.398 --> 13:37.264
| can't! I can't do it!
(LAUGHING)

13:37.567 --> 13:38.602
| can't! (LAUGHS)

13:38.901 --> 13:40.266
Mmm, no.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.062
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Oh! Good times.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.775
Mmm.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.109
Seriously, though,
where the hell is she?

13:46.409 --> 13:47.365
| mean, I sent that invitation
to her store hours ago.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.571
This is the invite?
Yeah.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.329
A fake plane ticket
for love airlines?

13:52.623 --> 13:54.364
Yeah. Check out
where she's sitting.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.532
Your cockpit.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.449
She's your sister.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.828
But well done.
Mmm-hmm.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.963
Wow. This looks
shockingly realistic.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.125
Well, I pride myself
on realism.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.260
You don't think Alex
saw this and thought...

14:07.555 --> 14:09.137
No. There's no way
she would actually...

14:09.432 --> 14:10.888
Well, she can
be pretty...

14:11.184 --> 14:12.345
Yeah, there was that
one time she ate that...

14:12.643 --> 14:13.508
Well, in her defense, it
did smell like a... (SIGHS)

14:13.811 --> 14:15.927
You would think
after one bite...

14:16.230 --> 14:18.892
You know, let's just say
what we're both thinking.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.148
Alex went to the airport.
Only an idiot eats a candle.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.068
And the airport thing.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.649
No biggie.
Let's just say

14:24.947 --> 14:26.062
someone went
to the airport

14:26.366 --> 14:27.197
with a fake plane ticket.
Mmm-hmm.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.948
You don't think
security would...

14:29.243 --> 14:30.404
(ZIP TIE ZIPS)
ow!

14:30.703 --> 14:31.909
Oh, but I'm being
whisked away!

14:32.205 --> 14:33.445
On love airlines!

14:33.748 --> 14:34.988
Ohhh. There it is.

14:35.958 --> 14:36.698
Shoot.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.250
(BRAKES SCREECH)

14:42.548 --> 14:44.505
Fine, Jane. I'll admit it. Taking
your car would've made more sense.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.586
We had to stop
for gas twice.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.875
Hey! You can't
park that here!

14:47.970 --> 14:49.381
Keep it.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.841
No, you're gonna
have to move it.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.505
Come on, man. It's
for love. | don't care!

14:52.809 --> 14:53.924
Come on, man, please!

14:54.227 --> 14:55.592
(GRUNTS) I'm warning you.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.602
All right, fine.
You know what?

14:57.897 --> 14:58.932
I'll move it.
I'll move it.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.518
Fake out!

15:00.817 --> 15:02.103
Stop right there! (GRUNTS) Uh!

15:02.402 --> 15:03.187
Don't worry!
| will find Alex!

15:03.486 --> 15:04.851
We got a runner!

15:05.154 --> 15:05.734
Come on, man, that
tickles! That tickles!

15:06.030 --> 15:08.192
Hold it, Miss!
(TASER CRACKLES)

15:08.491 --> 15:10.607
Ha, ha, ha! You fools!
That only makes me stronger!

15:11.577 --> 15:13.238
(TASER CRACKLES)
Ah! Ugh!

15:13.538 --> 15:15.745
Ooh. That one's
gonna sting.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.657
(AMPLIFIED VOICE) Now I got
just one commandment to y'all.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.496
Thou shalt not

15:21.796 --> 15:23.662
stop dancing!

15:23.965 --> 15:25.626
J Come here
Come here

15:25.925 --> 15:27.006
J Lay me down
Lay me down J

15:27.301 --> 15:28.666
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

15:28.970 --> 15:31.587
You know, I recently
came into a lot of

15:31.889 --> 15:33.505
savings bonds,
and, like me,

15:33.808 --> 15:35.014
they're gonna
mature fast.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.300
Oh, yeah? Fast enough
to get me three kids

15:37.603 --> 15:39.765
and a lake view
townhome before I'm 357

15:40.106 --> 15:42.268
Can you be that
for me, Jake?

15:44.402 --> 15:46.894
They get bigger but they
don't get better, Shawna.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.028
Now as y'all know, a bar
mitzvah is a special time.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.860
A time for friends,
a time for family,

about it?

a tiny tennis racket. (LAUGHS)

You know what,
Penny? You're right. Yep.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.646
There is a serious lack

Are we doomed?

Alex never made any effort

at all.

And this is traditionally a
very hard to please people.

Well, I don't care for
the way you phrased that.

getting out the game, too.

Not by choice.

officially considered a hate crime.

Yeah. I could see that.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.829
Kinda ruined that party
and screwed over Penny.

Nah, Penny's a pro. She'll
find a way to smooth things over.

to tell your parents
