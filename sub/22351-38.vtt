00:02.990 --> 00:05.989
Julie: Tonight, the final
four do battle, and by the end

00:05.990 --> 00:11.539
of the hour, only three will
have survived to make it to next
week's live finale.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.989
Welcome to "Big Brother."

00:13.990 --> 00:21.989
( Cheers and applause )
>> Previously on "Big Brother":

00:21.990 --> 00:24.409
With Steve and Johnny on the
block...

00:24.410 --> 00:27.989
I've nominated you, Steve,
and you, Johnny Mac.

00:27.990 --> 00:31.989
Vanessa's plan was to cancel
the rock star dentist's encore
tour.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.989
Johnny Mac is my main target
this week.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.999
Unfortunately I had to put Steve
on the block as well and it

00:36.000 --> 00:38.119
doesn't feel good on a personal
level.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.949
At the veto competition...
>> thank you.

00:40.950 --> 00:46.829
John ending up flozzing some
much-needed gold.

00:46.830 --> 00:48.989
I won the veto.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.989
I'm not going home this week you
people.

00:50.990 --> 00:52.989
Somebody has to go and it's not
me.

00:52.990 --> 00:53.990
So at the veto meeting.

00:53.991 --> 00:56.989
I have decided to use the
power of veto to save myself.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.989
Vanessa was forced to
nominate an Ally.

00:59.990 --> 01:01.989
Austin, please take a seat.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.989
Looking to seize the
opportunity...

01:03.990 --> 01:07.949
are we going to go down as
the dumbest people of all time

01:07.950 --> 01:10.989
in history if we don't break up
liztin.

01:10.990 --> 01:11.990
Right now, yeah.

01:11.991 --> 01:15.989
Vanessa came up with an
unexpected plan.

01:15.990 --> 01:21.989
We're like locked to make
final three if we keep Steve.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.989
Julie shocked the house with
a surprise eviction.

01:23.990 --> 01:30.989
One of you will be sent to
the jury house and we will crown
a new head of household.

01:30.990 --> 01:34.989
And Vanessa went through with
her double cross.

01:34.990 --> 01:36.989
Austin, I vote to evict you.

01:36.990 --> 01:37.990
Oh!

01:37.991 --> 01:39.989
Julie: It's official,
Austin...

01:39.990 --> 01:41.999
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.990
You are evicted from the "big
brother" house.

01:42.991 --> 01:47.999
Sending Judas to the imag
narrium.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.989
At the head of household
competition, Steve guaranteed

01:50.990 --> 01:52.699
his spot in the final three.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.289
Julie: You are the the new
h.O.H.

01:55.290 --> 01:59.829
Tonight, beast mode cowboy
returns to host the final and

01:59.830 --> 02:01.989
most important veto competition
of the season and another

02:01.990 --> 02:04.989
houseguest will be sent to jury.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.989
All this live on "Big Brother."

02:08.990 --> 02:10.989
Good luck, Austin.

02:10.990 --> 02:12.430
( Applause )
Captioning funded by CBS

02:48.830 --> 02:53.949
( cheers and applause )
Good evening.

02:53.950 --> 02:54.989
I'm Julie chen.

02:54.990 --> 02:56.699
Welcome to "Big Brother."

02:56.700 --> 03:00.989
Tonight, Steve will make the
final nominations of the summer,

03:00.990 --> 03:05.989
then Vanessa, John, Liz, and
Steve will battle in the final

03:05.990 --> 03:06.990
veto competition.

03:06.991 --> 03:13.989
He winner of that poaf will will
have the chance to change the

03:13.990 --> 03:16.989
nominations live and in the
prosthey will determine who will

03:16.990 --> 03:18.989
cast the sole vote to evict.

03:18.990 --> 03:23.289
So who will win the most
important veto of the summer and

03:23.290 --> 03:24.989
grab all the power?

03:24.990 --> 03:25.990
We'll soon find out.

03:25.991 --> 03:29.999
But first, in the wake of
blindsiding the austwins,

03:30.000 --> 03:34.989
Vanessa is left to do damage
control and plot her path to the

03:34.990 --> 03:37.289
final three.

03:37.290 --> 03:38.699
I'm sorry, Liz.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.989
I didn't want to do it like,
that but I had to do it.

03:41.990 --> 03:43.989
I know.

03:43.990 --> 03:44.990
I'm sorry.

03:44.990 --> 03:45.120
I didn't want to.

03:45.121 --> 03:46.989
I know.

03:46.990 --> 03:49.989
That was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do so far in

03:49.990 --> 03:50.990
this game.

03:50.991 --> 03:53.989
Austin was straight up the best
friend I had in the house.

03:53.990 --> 03:56.989
I know he trusted me, and that
feels so crappy.

03:56.990 --> 04:00.989
But it's just like I have to
keep telling myself that in this

04:00.990 --> 04:00.991
game, it was necessary.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.989
I mean, he was going to beat me.

04:03.990 --> 04:06.829
In the finals he was going to
beat me.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.989
I didn't want to, but you can
understand...

04:08.990 --> 04:10.289
I'm a bad person, I know.

04:10.290 --> 04:13.989
You've got tond, figet to
finals with you guys, I have to

04:13.990 --> 04:13.991
win.

04:13.991 --> 04:14.990
I know, I know.

04:14.991 --> 04:16.989
Otherwise, I'm never going.

04:16.990 --> 04:17.990
Do you understand that?

04:17.991 --> 04:20.989
Do you understand how hard it is
to play in that situation?

04:20.990 --> 04:21.990
Vanessa is crying.

04:21.991 --> 04:25.989
She's saying all these things to
me how sorry she is, and I am

04:25.990 --> 04:26.990
not even listening.

04:26.991 --> 04:28.989
I am so shocked.

04:28.990 --> 04:36.989
Vanessa completely betrayed
Austin, and now I just know that
I have to do this thing on my
own.

04:36.990 --> 04:37.990
And I'm sorry.

04:37.990 --> 04:38.990
I'm so sorry.

04:38.990 --> 04:39.990
It's okay.

04:39.991 --> 04:40.999
It's okay.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.539
Can I have a hug?

04:42.540 --> 04:43.989
I need a hug of some kind.

04:43.990 --> 04:44.990
Oh, my God.

04:44.991 --> 04:46.989
Austin was sent out the door.

04:46.990 --> 04:53.989
Liz has no idea what's going on,
but, Steve, me, and Vanessa

04:53.990 --> 05:01.990
decide to do this right before
the eviction ceremony.

05:04.990 --> 05:08.989
Okay.

05:08.990 --> 05:15.989
Okay.

05:15.990 --> 05:17.989
Come in.

05:17.990 --> 05:21.989
Hi.

05:21.990 --> 05:24.989
Trust just trust me on this one?

05:24.990 --> 05:26.989
Do you trust me, Steve?

05:26.990 --> 05:28.409
Yes.

05:28.410 --> 05:28.990
Go.

05:28.991 --> 05:30.989
It's time.

05:30.990 --> 05:33.999
This is so nerve-racking.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.990
We got this?

05:34.991 --> 05:36.989
We got it?

05:36.990 --> 05:37.990
We got it.

05:37.991 --> 05:41.989
Like a work of art, it couldn't
have come out any more

05:41.990 --> 05:43.989
beautifully, and job well done.

05:43.990 --> 05:44.990
Good work, guys.

05:44.991 --> 05:46.989
I really adore Austin.

05:46.990 --> 05:48.989
I so do.

05:48.990 --> 05:53.989
Like, I'm telling you, I adore
him.

05:53.990 --> 05:58.989
Julie: The correct answer
is 2,825 seconds.

05:58.990 --> 06:00.989
Which means, congratulations,
Steve.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.989
You are the new h.O.H.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.989
I don't believe it.

06:05.990 --> 06:11.539
I just won head of household by
nothing more than sheer dumb

06:11.540 --> 06:11.990
luck.

06:11.990 --> 06:12.950
I did the math wrong.

06:12.951 --> 06:17.989
It was supposed to be 6,001.

06:17.990 --> 06:20.989
By some freak of nature I will
never be stepping foot in the

06:20.990 --> 06:22.409
jury house, guaranteed.

06:22.410 --> 06:22.990
Thank you, by the way.

06:22.990 --> 06:23.990
You're welcome.

06:23.990 --> 06:23.991
I told you.

06:23.991 --> 06:24.990
I know.

06:24.991 --> 06:27.409
Give me a hug.

06:27.410 --> 06:29.989
Steve wins the h.O.H., and
this is a big stress off my

06:29.990 --> 06:32.409
shoulders, because if Liz had
won h.O.H., that would have been

06:32.410 --> 06:33.989
my worst-case scenario.

06:33.990 --> 06:36.989
But at the end of the day,
h.O.H.S don't mean much in the

06:36.990 --> 06:38.989
final four in "Big Brother."

06:38.990 --> 06:40.989
It all comes down it the veto.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.989
I seriously think I'm going

06:42.990 --> 06:43.990
to throw up.

06:43.990 --> 06:44.000
Go throw up.

06:44.001 --> 06:45.989
Yeah.

06:45.990 --> 06:47.289
Imented to win this
competition so bad today because

06:47.290 --> 06:47.990
I wanted to be safe for the
week.

06:47.990 --> 06:48.990
Very disappointed.

06:48.991 --> 06:51.989
Johnny Mac, 0 h.O.H.S all
season, final four.

06:51.990 --> 06:53.989
Probably going to get evicted.

06:53.990 --> 07:00.989
I have to talk to you, Liz,
afterwards, once you calm down.

07:00.990 --> 07:04.989
Words can't describe how
livid I am.

07:04.990 --> 07:08.989
Not only does Steve not go home,
but he wins head of household.

07:08.990 --> 07:12.989
I want to yank that key off his
neck so bad.

07:12.990 --> 07:14.989
Austin was my voice of reason.

07:14.990 --> 07:17.989
He was my support, and now I
don't have him.

07:17.990 --> 07:18.990
And it suction.

07:18.991 --> 07:20.829
But I gotab strong.

07:20.830 --> 07:25.119
I gotta put my game face on, and
I have to win these competitions

07:25.120 --> 07:30.540
for him and Julia.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.699
Man!

07:35.700 --> 07:36.989
Vanessa, can we talk now?

07:36.990 --> 07:38.989
Oh, my God, yeah.

07:38.990 --> 07:41.989
I was leaving you around because
I didn't know if you wanted to.

07:41.990 --> 07:44.989
I'm a wreck, just so you know.

07:44.990 --> 07:47.989
Evicting Austin was terrifying
but my biggest hurd thel week is

07:47.990 --> 07:49.989
going to be talking to Liz
because she did not see this

07:49.990 --> 07:51.989
coming and that is all my fault.

07:51.990 --> 07:54.989
I need to have a conversation
with her, and I'm just banking

07:54.990 --> 07:56.989
on the fact she doesn't totally
hate me.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.989
It was hands down the toughest
decision I've made strategically

07:59.990 --> 08:03.989
and the single most
gut-wrempingly awful feeling I

08:03.990 --> 08:05.989
had in this game in the whole
time.

08:05.990 --> 08:08.289
Only two people can make finals,
you see that, right?

08:08.290 --> 08:11.699
With the both of you, I had to
make a choice.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.989
I'm just sad about, like, the
way it happened.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.539
It's terrible upon.

08:16.540 --> 08:17.989
It was so fast.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.989
But you see there was no
other way.

08:19.990 --> 08:21.409
I couldn't kiss or cry.

08:21.410 --> 08:22.539
I was show shocked.

08:22.540 --> 08:25.989
Understand, because as much
as I loved you both, you're in a

08:25.990 --> 08:25.991
relationship and I'm not.

08:25.991 --> 08:26.990
I know.

08:26.991 --> 08:28.989
Which means if I get to
finals with you guys, as great

08:28.990 --> 08:31.989
as it would have been for you
guys, for me it's terrible.

08:31.990 --> 08:34.989
That's why they say showmances
can't go far.

08:34.990 --> 08:35.990
I have no one.

08:35.990 --> 08:36.990
I'm alone.

08:36.990 --> 08:37.990
You're not alone.

08:37.991 --> 08:40.699
I know you can't see it now,
but, Liz, this is better for

08:40.700 --> 08:40.990
your game.

08:40.991 --> 08:43.989
Right now, if you want to win
this you better switch around.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.989
You better turn on that charm
and do what you can do.

08:46.990 --> 08:47.990
I need you in this game.

08:47.991 --> 08:49.989
I never lied.

08:49.990 --> 08:50.410
That.

08:50.411 --> 08:53.989
Everything I ever said to you is
1,000% genuine.

08:53.990 --> 08:54.990
I'm not dumb.

08:54.991 --> 08:56.989
I know I just have myself in
this game.

08:56.990 --> 08:58.989
I can't stand Steve and Johnny
Mac is just whatever.

08:58.990 --> 09:02.989
As much as it sickens me I have
to work with Vanessa because

09:02.990 --> 09:04.989
she's all I got at this point.

09:04.990 --> 09:07.989
Austin came in as an individual
individual.

09:07.990 --> 09:11.989
He made it clear he loves me but
he wasn't going to sacrifice his

09:11.990 --> 09:13.989
game for me and I can't do it
for him.

09:13.990 --> 09:16.409
I don't think of it like that.

09:16.410 --> 09:18.989
I don't have any animosity
against you.

09:18.990 --> 09:21.989
I'm giving you my word on
Mel, I will take you with me.

09:21.990 --> 09:29.990
We're going to kick ass, and
you're not alone in in thing.

10:13.990 --> 10:14.990
Because Steve won the h.O.H.

10:14.991 --> 10:18.989
This week, I know I'll never end
up in the final three with both

10:18.990 --> 10:19.990
Liz and Johnny Mac.

10:19.991 --> 10:23.989
So I'm freed up to make a final
two with both of them because I

10:23.990 --> 10:26.990
won't end up in the final three
with both of them ever.

10:30.540 --> 10:31.989
Vanessa changes her mind a lot.

10:31.990 --> 10:35.989
As far as I'm concerned, I'm
making this final two deal seem

10:35.990 --> 10:39.989
as really as it can be, because
I need her to feel 100% safe

10:39.990 --> 10:40.990
with me.

10:40.991 --> 10:48.990
We got to win the veto.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.989
This is the nomination ceremony.

11:00.990 --> 11:04.949
It is my responsibility as the
head of household to nominate

11:04.950 --> 11:06.119
two houseguests for eviction.

11:06.120 --> 11:10.989
I will turn two keys to lock in
my nominations and their faces

11:10.990 --> 11:11.999
will appear on the memory wall.

11:12.000 --> 11:20.000
The first houseguest I have
nominated is...

11:25.990 --> 11:33.990
The next houseguest I have
nominated is...

11:38.540 --> 11:39.989
Sad face.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.989
We have never seen your face
pop up there.

11:42.990 --> 11:46.829
I have nominated you, Johnny
Mac, and you, Vanessa, for

11:46.830 --> 11:46.990
eviction this week.

11:46.991 --> 11:50.989
First of all, huge
congratulations, final four,

11:50.990 --> 11:54.949
final nomination ceremony of the
summer, final veto competition

11:54.950 --> 11:54.990
tomorrow.

11:54.991 --> 11:57.989
As usual, these nominations are
purely strategic.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.989
There's nothing personal to be
derived from them.

11:59.990 --> 12:01.989
This nomination ceremony is
adjourned.

12:01.990 --> 12:04.989
I need a cookie.

12:04.990 --> 12:09.989
I have had a very stressful
day, so it's a bit of a relief

12:09.990 --> 12:12.289
to not see my face pop up on the
memory wall.

12:12.290 --> 12:17.989
However, I know that this week
it actually doesn't mean a thing

12:17.990 --> 12:19.989
because it's all up to the
person that wins the veto.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.989
Number 9.

12:21.990 --> 12:23.989
Unlike most nomination
ceremonies, everyone's kind of

12:23.990 --> 12:26.989
happy and relaxed because it's
all about the veto this week.

12:26.990 --> 12:29.989
If you win the veto, not only do
you save yourself from the block

12:29.990 --> 12:33.119
but you're the soul vote to send
someone to jury, and that's

12:33.120 --> 12:33.990
pretty awesome.

12:33.991 --> 12:36.989
I love how we're just so
immediately past that.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.989
We're just, "that happened."

12:38.990 --> 12:40.989
The one person I really don't
want to win is Vanessa.

12:40.990 --> 12:43.539
I don't see myself beating her
in the final two.

12:43.540 --> 12:46.989
I think she could be a very
strong competitor for the final

12:46.990 --> 12:47.410
h.O.H.

12:47.411 --> 12:48.989
Thank you, Vanessa, for keeping
me in the house.

12:48.990 --> 12:52.999
However, I still don't trust
you.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.989
Julie: Coming up, it's the
final veto competition of the
summer.

12:57.990 --> 13:01.119
The winner not only guarantees
themselves a spot in the final

13:01.120 --> 13:09.120
three but he or she will decide
who casts the sole vote to
evict.

13:09.990 --> 13:14.409
Plus "Big Brother" legends
Rachel and Brendon stop by to
break some news live.

13:14.410 --> 13:14.990
Stay with us.

13:14.990 --> 13:15.990
( Cheers and applause )

13:35.990 --> 13:37.989
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

13:37.990 --> 13:41.989
With finale night looming, how
did the members of the jury

13:41.990 --> 13:48.989
react when two-thirds of the
austwins showed up on their
doorstep?

13:48.990 --> 13:52.989
Our next jury member is
coming in, who do you think it

13:52.990 --> 13:53.120
will be?

13:53.120 --> 13:53.990
Vanessa.

13:53.991 --> 13:56.539
I'm starting to think it
might be.

13:56.540 --> 13:57.989
And all of her hats, too.

13:57.990 --> 14:05.539
Yes.

14:05.540 --> 14:06.989
Julia!

14:06.990 --> 14:09.999
You know, being out of the
game is definitely a hard fill

14:10.000 --> 14:10.990
pillto swallow.

14:10.991 --> 14:12.829
Who were you up against?

14:12.830 --> 14:12.990
Liz.

14:12.991 --> 14:14.989
Wait, wait, say it again?

14:14.990 --> 14:16.289
You were next to Liz?

14:16.290 --> 14:16.990
Julia?

14:16.991 --> 14:18.989
I mean, sheelings the last
person I expected.

14:18.990 --> 14:21.949
I would think immediately you
would go federal Liz and take

14:21.950 --> 14:25.989
her out.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.829
One's a competition beast.

14:27.830 --> 14:27.990
Julia not so much.

14:27.991 --> 14:31.989
I shouldn't be talking.

14:31.990 --> 14:31.991
I'm aware of that.

14:31.991 --> 14:32.990
Who put you there?

14:32.990 --> 14:33.990
Steve!

14:33.991 --> 14:40.989
Let me just show you.

14:40.990 --> 14:40.991
Lawyer.

14:40.991 --> 14:42.989
Steve, you are the new head
of household!

14:42.990 --> 14:43.950
Wow.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.289
I thought I was happy with
Steve winning but that wasn't

14:46.290 --> 14:47.989
the case.

14:47.990 --> 14:55.990
Julia, who would you like to
challenge in the next bowlerina
match?

14:56.410 --> 14:57.989
Thank you, Vanessa, oh, my God.

14:57.990 --> 15:00.989
I would like to challenge
Austin.

15:00.990 --> 15:01.999
Why!

15:02.000 --> 15:02.700
Why!

15:02.701 --> 15:03.989
I started panicking.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.989
I'm like why is she telling me
this?

15:05.990 --> 15:07.989
I'm like does she know something
I don't?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.289
She literally, like, just got in
my head.

15:10.290 --> 15:11.989
Was he mad?

15:11.990 --> 15:13.989
Him and Vanessa got into a
fight.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.989
But you know what Vanessa said
to me.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.999
She was like, "Julia, I swear on
my family, on my mom, that I

15:19.000 --> 15:20.949
wasn't trying to play you.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.989
I was just trying to give you
advice in the moment.

15:22.990 --> 15:26.989
Let me tell you, I have so many
things on Austin I could tell

15:26.990 --> 15:30.989
you right now.

15:30.990 --> 15:34.989
Liz has to choose hoto cheer
for right here.

15:34.990 --> 15:38.989
You have won the golden power
of veto.

15:38.990 --> 15:39.540
Wow!

15:39.541 --> 15:44.989
I knew that me and Liz were
going on the block for sure.

15:44.990 --> 15:47.829
Julie: Jewellia, are you
evicted from the "Big Brother"

15:47.830 --> 15:48.989
house.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.989
No animosity against Steve.

15:51.990 --> 15:54.989
It would have been stupid to go
with me, Liz, and Austin.

15:54.990 --> 15:58.989
All of us have gotten this
point by their playing.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.289
Five deserving winners.

16:00.290 --> 16:00.990
I absolutely agree.

16:00.990 --> 16:01.990
Absolutely.

16:01.991 --> 16:03.989
So who you all think is
coming in today?

16:03.990 --> 16:07.989
I definitely think if Austin
or Liz win, Steve will probably

16:07.990 --> 16:08.290
be joining us soon.

16:08.290 --> 16:08.990
Yeah.

16:08.991 --> 16:10.989
Who do you think Johnny Mac
would put up?

16:10.990 --> 16:11.990
I think Austin.

16:11.991 --> 16:15.990
Austin and Liz.

16:21.990 --> 16:25.989
Well, a couple has never made
it this far in the game, so hats

16:25.990 --> 16:26.990
to them.

16:26.991 --> 16:29.989
Is that how it goes, the hats
off.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.989
Hats off?

16:32.990 --> 16:33.000
Oh!

16:33.001 --> 16:34.989
Oh, my God!

16:34.990 --> 16:35.990
Austin!

16:35.991 --> 16:37.289
What do you think happened?

16:37.290 --> 16:38.949
I'll give you one guess.

16:38.950 --> 16:39.290
Steve!

16:39.290 --> 16:39.990
No.

16:39.991 --> 16:41.829
John!

16:41.830 --> 16:42.989
Vanessa!

16:42.990 --> 16:43.830
Bingo.

16:43.830 --> 16:43.990
Vanessa?

16:43.991 --> 16:45.539
I'm scared for Liz now.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.989
She's alone in the house with a
bunch of sharks.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.989
Blindside.

16:49.990 --> 16:50.990
Judas got judassed.

16:50.990 --> 16:51.990
She got you, too.

16:51.990 --> 16:52.990
, of course.

16:52.991 --> 16:55.699
Vanessa, you're underestimating
Judas.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.989
Now he's in the jury house and
he might be determining your

16:57.990 --> 16:58.990
fate, bare foot or not.

16:58.991 --> 17:00.989
Vanessa won h.O.H.

17:00.990 --> 17:04.989
She put up Steve and Johnny Mac,
she swear to me and Liz we were

17:04.990 --> 17:07.989
safe, and then she blindsided me
at the eviction.

17:07.990 --> 17:09.989
Oh, my God!

17:09.990 --> 17:10.990
Oh!

17:10.991 --> 17:12.989
Let's watch.

17:12.990 --> 17:17.989
I have decided to use the
power of veto to save myself.

17:17.990 --> 17:20.989
So, Austin, please take a seat.

17:20.990 --> 17:23.989
I still thought Vanessa was
going to have my back.

17:23.990 --> 17:24.990
Julie: We have a tie.

17:24.990 --> 17:25.990
Oh, man!

17:25.991 --> 17:27.989
I don't want to watch this.

17:27.990 --> 17:28.000
Oh, my God.

17:28.001 --> 17:31.989
I'm sorry, Austin, I vote to
evict you.

17:31.990 --> 17:33.119
Oh, my gosh!

17:33.120 --> 17:37.289
She said it with no merc, just,
like, just cut your throat.

17:37.290 --> 17:37.990
Bam!

17:37.990 --> 17:38.990
Out of nowhere.

17:38.990 --> 17:39.950
Oh, my God.

17:39.950 --> 17:40.950
I'm so sorry.

17:40.951 --> 17:43.989
Oh, my God.

17:43.990 --> 17:44.990
He doesn't have shoes on.

17:44.991 --> 17:46.989
She didn't need to do it that
way to me.

17:46.990 --> 17:49.989
I know that you're hurt
because you got blindsided, and

17:49.990 --> 17:54.989
I feel you, but you cannot deny
what an amazing game she has

17:54.990 --> 17:57.989
played...
>> I can and I will.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.989
I don't think she played an
amazing game.

17:59.990 --> 18:00.830
Okay.

18:00.831 --> 18:03.989
I think she played a flawed
game and I can tell you a

18:03.990 --> 18:04.990
million reasons it was flawed.

18:04.991 --> 18:07.989
None of us knew it was flawed
the whole entire time.

18:07.990 --> 18:07.991
Di!

18:07.991 --> 18:12.989
Somehow, she managed to stay
in the house, even though we all

18:12.990 --> 18:13.990
knew what Vanessa was doing.

18:13.991 --> 18:16.989
Who was in the house and who is
sitting on this couch?

18:16.990 --> 18:18.119
Vanessa blindsided me.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.409
It's a mistake that I'm going to
make sure costs her the game.

18:21.410 --> 18:24.829
I did not expect this four,
that's for sure.

18:24.830 --> 18:25.989
No!

18:25.990 --> 18:28.989
I would never have guessed
that these four hodgepodge

18:28.990 --> 18:31.989
people would make it to final
four, and it's really time to

18:31.990 --> 18:33.989
start asking some really
important questions to make this

18:33.990 --> 18:34.999
big decision.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.989
Next veto has more to do with
this game than ever before.

18:37.990 --> 18:42.699
And every single one of them
are playing.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.989
Julie: Here joining us live
are two people who have

18:45.990 --> 18:48.829
experienced the "Big Brother"
jury firsthand.

18:48.830 --> 18:52.999
On season 12, they both served
on it, and on season 13, she

18:53.000 --> 18:56.989
faced the jury on finale night
and won.

18:56.990 --> 18:59.989
Please say hello to Rachel and
Brendon.

18:59.990 --> 19:03.989
( Cheers and applause )
Welcome back.

19:03.990 --> 19:05.989
Thanks, I'm so excited.

19:05.990 --> 19:07.989
Julie: Rachel, I'm going to
start with you.

19:07.990 --> 19:09.989
What has surprised you the most
about this season of "big

19:09.990 --> 19:09.991
brother"?

19:09.991 --> 19:12.539
You know that there are no
floaters at the end.

19:12.540 --> 19:13.989
It's really interesting.

19:13.990 --> 19:17.829
Normally, we see some floaters
but this season we have Vanessa,

19:17.830 --> 19:21.989
Steve, Liz, and even John, have
really played the game, in their

19:21.990 --> 19:24.989
own way, but they've really
played the game.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.989
Julie: You said, "even
John."

19:26.990 --> 19:30.289
I want to talk about John to
Brendon because you two have

19:30.290 --> 19:32.989
something in common pup were
both evictd and you both won a

19:32.990 --> 19:36.539
competition to get your way back
in the house.

19:36.540 --> 19:39.989
But unlike John, Brendon, you
were sent packing again and he

19:39.990 --> 19:41.989
made it to final four.

19:41.990 --> 19:43.989
What do you have to say about
his accomplishments?

19:43.990 --> 19:46.989
Definitely, for all the
evictees out there, I think John

19:46.990 --> 19:49.989
represented us well.

19:49.990 --> 19:50.990
He did a good job.

19:50.991 --> 19:52.989
I think he turned it on,
maneuvered his way through the

19:52.990 --> 19:54.699
game when he need to.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.989
For me right now, I have to say
John win a p. O.V..

19:57.990 --> 20:00.989
He needs to win an h.O.H., and
he has to win the final

20:00.990 --> 20:01.990
competition to be able to
convince the jury.

20:01.991 --> 20:05.989
Because I just don't know that
John has... I love j-Mac, we all

20:05.990 --> 20:10.989
love j-Mac, but we need him to
convince us he deserves to win.

20:10.990 --> 20:13.119
Julie: I want to talk about
romance in the house because the

20:13.120 --> 20:15.989
two of you met in the "big
brother" house in the summer of

20:15.990 --> 20:16.990
2010.

20:16.990 --> 20:16.991
Yeah.

20:16.991 --> 20:20.989
Julie: In the fall of 2012,
the two of you got married.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.989
You were the first two
houseguests to get married.

20:22.990 --> 20:26.989
I want to talk about Liz and
Austin.

20:26.990 --> 20:29.989
Rachel, do you think this couple
has a shot at a real

20:29.990 --> 20:30.990
relationship outside the house?

20:30.990 --> 20:31.990
You know, I do.

20:31.991 --> 20:36.989
I think that Austin is going to
give it a shot 1,000%.

20:36.990 --> 20:38.989
I think he's going to totally go
for it.

20:38.990 --> 20:42.989
And as long as Liz doesn't get
caught up in the after-b.B.

20:42.990 --> 20:45.539
World, I think they totally do
have a shot.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.989
They seem to like each other.

20:46.990 --> 20:50.989
In the "Big Brother" house you
form a really special bond.

20:50.990 --> 20:53.989
It brought Brendon and I so
close together.

20:53.990 --> 20:54.990
I'm rooting for them.

20:54.990 --> 20:55.990
I'm rooting for liztin.

20:55.991 --> 20:57.989
Julie: Brendon, do you think
they have a shot?

20:57.990 --> 21:01.539
They have a shot but they
also have a shot at winning half

21:01.540 --> 21:05.989
a million dollars and some of
them didn't do that either.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.989
Julie: You guys have come
on the show to make an

21:07.990 --> 21:09.989
announcement, so you have the
floor.

21:09.990 --> 21:10.990
Yes.

21:10.991 --> 21:14.989
Well, you know, Julie how I say
no one comes in between me and

21:14.990 --> 21:18.989
my man all the time, except a
brenchel baby!

21:18.990 --> 21:20.989
Julie: You are expecting!

21:20.990 --> 21:21.990
Congratulations!

21:21.991 --> 21:23.989
Thank you!

21:23.990 --> 21:24.990
( Cheers and applause ).

21:24.990 --> 21:25.990
Julie: Beautiful news.

21:25.991 --> 21:32.699
Well, we have a little onesie
for baby brenchel, just a little

21:32.700 --> 21:35.989
suggestion for a name
potentially.

21:35.990 --> 21:35.991
Congratulations.

21:35.991 --> 21:36.990
Thank you so much!

21:36.990 --> 21:37.990
Julie: Best of luck.

21:37.991 --> 21:39.989
This is so cute.

21:39.990 --> 21:42.999
Julie: Drink lots of water
and get lot of rest.

21:43.000 --> 21:43.990
She is, she is.

21:43.990 --> 21:44.990
Julie: So nice to see you
guys.

21:44.991 --> 21:48.989
Coming up next, the final veto
competition of the summer.

21:48.990 --> 21:54.989
They battle it out to secure a
spot in the final three.

21:54.990 --> 21:57.539
Stay with us.

21:57.540 --> 21:58.540
( Cheers and applause )

22:10.540 --> 22:13.989
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

22:13.990 --> 22:16.989
It's time for the most important
power of veto competition of the
summer.

22:16.990 --> 22:20.989
The winner not only guarantees
themselves a spot in the final
three.

22:20.990 --> 22:24.989
They decide which houseguest
will cast the sole vote to

22:24.990 --> 22:25.000
evict.

22:25.001 --> 22:27.989
Who will win the final power of
veto?

22:27.990 --> 22:35.990
It's time to find out.

22:40.700 --> 22:47.409
So we walk outside to the
backyard and see this kung fu,

22:47.410 --> 22:52.989
ninja, Asian fusion setup.

22:52.990 --> 22:54.989
( Gong ).

22:54.990 --> 22:55.410
No!

22:55.411 --> 22:59.989
Oh, my God!

22:59.990 --> 23:01.289
Beast mode!

23:01.290 --> 23:08.989
And then out of nowhere we see
Caleb... a.K.A., beast mode

23:08.990 --> 23:10.989
cowboy... from season 16, and I
am stunned.

23:10.990 --> 23:11.990
And I'm just like, dang.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.409
Austin can't even do that.

23:13.410 --> 23:15.119
He's going to be really jealous.

23:15.120 --> 23:20.989
You were the hottest ninnia
ever!

23:20.990 --> 23:22.409
Thank you.

23:22.410 --> 23:25.829
Welcome to the "Big Brother"
bojo.

23:25.830 --> 23:28.989
Today, you will need to put your
martial arts skills and brother

23:28.990 --> 23:34.119
sparts to work in a little game
I'm calling "martial smart."

23:34.120 --> 23:34.990
Whoa!

23:34.991 --> 23:36.699
I see what you did there.

23:36.700 --> 23:40.289
This karate tournament will
be played over several matches.

23:40.290 --> 23:42.989
In each match, I will read an
event that has happened in the

23:42.990 --> 23:44.949
"Big Brother" house.

23:44.950 --> 23:47.989
Your job is to figure out what
day it happened on.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.989
At the sound of the gong, run
down to your opponent and punch

23:50.990 --> 23:51.990
or kick it.

23:51.991 --> 23:55.119
You can make your counter go up
five days for a glove punch or

23:55.120 --> 23:57.989
one day for a shin blow.

23:57.990 --> 24:01.989
Once you have the day you want
on your counter, run back and

24:01.990 --> 24:02.700
ring in.

24:02.701 --> 24:05.989
If the day is correct, your
counter will flash, and you are

24:05.990 --> 24:07.989
safe for the match.

24:07.990 --> 24:10.989
Answer incorrectly, and your
counter will reset, and you will

24:10.990 --> 24:12.699
have to guess again.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.989
The last martial artist to
answer correctly in each round

24:15.990 --> 24:18.989
will get one strike against
them, two strikes you're out of

24:18.990 --> 24:19.700
the tournament.

24:19.701 --> 24:23.289
The last martial artist standing
will win the tournament and earn

24:23.290 --> 24:24.989
the power of veto.

24:24.990 --> 24:28.989
Are you ready to play martial
smart?

24:28.990 --> 24:32.699
Yes!

24:32.700 --> 24:35.949
This is the most important
competition of the entire

24:35.950 --> 24:35.990
summer.

24:35.991 --> 24:38.989
Not only am I able to lock up my
safety for final three, but

24:38.990 --> 24:41.989
fiwin power of veto, I will be
able to choose who is going to

24:41.990 --> 24:44.999
come along with me and Steve to
final three and that's a huge

24:45.000 --> 24:45.830
power.

24:45.831 --> 24:47.989
This is one of the most
important competitioning yet of

24:47.990 --> 24:49.989
the summer because it determines
who is going to join me in the

24:49.990 --> 24:50.990
final three.

24:50.991 --> 24:56.989
I can win this thing, use it on
Johnny, and send Vanessa out the

24:56.990 --> 24:57.120
door.

24:57.121 --> 25:05.121
On what day did Clay win his
only competition?

25:08.990 --> 25:14.699
Round one is on what day did
Clay win his only competition?

25:14.700 --> 25:16.829
How could I forget that.

25:16.830 --> 25:24.830
That was day 38.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.989
( Buzzer ).

25:26.990 --> 25:27.999
No!

25:28.000 --> 25:28.990
Oh, my God!

25:28.990 --> 25:29.990
I knew it.

25:29.991 --> 25:32.989
It was day 38 that Clay won
the get nutty competition.

25:32.990 --> 25:33.990
Sorry, Liz.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.989
You rang in last.

25:35.990 --> 25:41.829
That's one strike against you.

25:41.830 --> 25:46.989
( Applause ) >> Nice!

25:46.990 --> 25:53.989
On what day did Shelli
complete her 2400 swordsman

25:53.990 --> 25:59.989
training regimen?

25:59.990 --> 26:07.990
( Gong ) >> Oh, my God!

26:12.990 --> 26:15.989
The correct answer was day 46.

26:15.990 --> 26:15.991
Sorry, Liz.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.989
You rang in last.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.989
That's your second strike.

26:19.990 --> 26:27.989
You have been eliminated from
the tournament.

26:27.990 --> 26:29.989
I am beyond frustrated.

26:29.990 --> 26:33.989
I am the first person to be
chopped out of this competition,

26:33.990 --> 26:39.989
and now I have to rely on my
girl Vanessa to pull this one

26:39.989 --> 26:40.120
Oh!

26:40.121 --> 26:41.989
I got them both right too,.

26:41.990 --> 26:43.989
So Liz is the first player
eliminated.

26:43.990 --> 26:47.989
That leaves Steve, Vanessa,
myself playing in this veto

26:47.990 --> 26:48.830
competition.

26:48.830 --> 26:48.990
I'm feeling pretty good.

26:48.991 --> 26:53.989
Z is the one person that I could
not win this veto because she

26:53.990 --> 26:55.989
would probably take me out of
the game.

26:55.990 --> 26:56.990
Round three.

26:56.991 --> 27:04.989
On what day did zingbot enter
the "Big Brother" house?

27:04.990 --> 27:06.949
Oh, yeah I remember that day.

27:06.950 --> 27:09.989
It was one of the worst days
ever because I got zinged and I

27:09.990 --> 27:12.989
lost a veto that ended up
kicking me out of the house.

27:12.990 --> 27:18.989
That was day 66.

27:18.990 --> 27:26.989
( Buzzer ) ( Buzzer )

27:26.990 --> 27:29.989
( Bell prin prin ( Buzzer ).

27:29.990 --> 27:32.989
The correct answer was day 66.

27:32.990 --> 27:40.990
Sorry, Steve, that's one strike
against you.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.540
Round four.

27:44.541 --> 27:50.829
On what day was Meg put on the
block for the second time?

27:50.830 --> 27:58.830
I have nominated you, Meg,
for eviction.

27:58.990 --> 28:06.990
( Buzzer ) ( Buzzer )

28:07.990 --> 28:14.989
( Bell )
>> I can't figure out what I'm

28:14.990 --> 28:15.990
missing here.

28:15.991 --> 28:17.989
Meg's first nomination was the
week of the phone party.

28:17.990 --> 28:21.989
The second nomination was by me
on day 57.

28:21.990 --> 28:23.989
What am I missing here?

28:23.990 --> 28:24.999
( Buzzer ).

28:25.000 --> 28:28.829
What was it?

28:28.830 --> 28:29.999
First nomination...

28:30.000 --> 28:30.990
( Bell ).

28:30.991 --> 28:33.989
Yes!

28:33.990 --> 28:37.829
The correct answer was day 23.

28:37.830 --> 28:37.990
Sorry, Steve.

28:37.991 --> 28:38.999
That's your second strike.

28:39.000 --> 28:47.000
You have been eliminated from
the tournament.

28:47.290 --> 28:51.699
Meg was Shelli's replacement
nomination.

28:51.700 --> 28:54.989
She didn't play in the that
weekend.

28:54.990 --> 28:57.699
I don't think I would have made
this mistake.

28:57.700 --> 29:00.989
I think I felt too comfortable
as h.O.H. And that's I blew it.

29:00.990 --> 29:02.989
It's down to John and Vanessa.

29:02.990 --> 29:05.989
I can't believe it, but Steve
just dropped out of competition,

29:05.990 --> 29:08.989
and it's down to me and Johnny
Mac competing for the veto.

29:08.990 --> 29:11.409
I cannot overstate how important
this moment is.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.989
The veto in the final four is
everything.

29:13.990 --> 29:15.989
Steve is out of the competition!

29:15.990 --> 29:19.989
The only two people left are
Vanessa and myself.

29:19.990 --> 29:20.990
Ninja versus ninja.

29:20.991 --> 29:23.989
We're going to battle for the
final veto.

29:23.990 --> 29:24.990
( Gong ).

29:24.991 --> 29:27.989
Julie: Coming up, it's down
to Vanessa and John.

29:27.990 --> 29:31.989
The winner of this veto secures
a spot in the final three.

29:31.990 --> 29:34.989
The loser's game hangs in the
balance.

29:34.990 --> 29:38.699
The conclusion of the veto
competition is next.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.989
Stay with us.

29:40.990 --> 29:41.990
( Cheers and applause )

29:52.990 --> 29:54.989
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

29:54.990 --> 29:59.989
Tonight's live eviction lies in
the hand of either Vanessa or
j-Mac.

29:59.990 --> 30:04.949
Who will win the veto and hold
all the power?

30:04.950 --> 30:06.989
It's down to John and Vanessa.

30:06.990 --> 30:09.989
So it's me and Vanessa, but
here we are going to battle for

30:09.990 --> 30:10.990
the final veto.

30:10.991 --> 30:15.989
I have to be ninja fast to pull
it off.

30:15.990 --> 30:20.989
Round five, on what day did
Frankie Grande enter the "big

30:20.990 --> 30:22.539
brother" house?

30:22.540 --> 30:23.829
( Doorbell ).

30:23.830 --> 30:31.830
Who wants to shine bright
like a Frankie!

30:32.950 --> 30:37.989
In round five the question
is, "on what day did Frankie

30:37.990 --> 30:40.989
Grande enter the house?"
I know this is day 86, because

30:40.990 --> 30:45.989
on day 86 I was 86'd from the
"Big Brother" building and sent

30:45.990 --> 30:46.990
out to a concert.

30:46.990 --> 30:47.990
Pretty much the best day of the
summer for me.

30:47.991 --> 30:49.999
The correct answer was day 86.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.989
Sorry, John.

30:51.990 --> 30:58.989
That's jur first strike.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.989
Between Vanessa and myself,
whoever wins is going right to

31:01.990 --> 31:05.539
final three and the other person
has to stay up on the chopping

31:05.540 --> 31:05.990
block.

31:05.991 --> 31:08.949
Out of those two options, I know
which one I would rather choose

31:08.950 --> 31:09.999
for myself.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.989
Round 6, on what day was the
sixth nomination ceremony?

31:14.990 --> 31:16.989
This is the nomination ceremony.

31:16.990 --> 31:20.989
I have nominated you, Clay, and
you, Shelli.

31:20.990 --> 31:23.989
( Gong )
>> I know these days like the

31:23.990 --> 31:26.989
back of my hand, but this
thing's a race, and that's the

31:26.990 --> 31:27.990
part that's killing me.

31:27.991 --> 31:30.989
I'm going so fast, I keep
overshooting the number and

31:30.990 --> 31:31.990
messing up.

31:31.991 --> 31:39.991
( Buzzer ) ( Buzzer )

31:40.990 --> 31:48.989
( Bell )
>> The correct answer was day

31:48.990 --> 31:49.990
44.

31:49.990 --> 31:50.000
Congratulations, Vanessa.

31:50.001 --> 31:57.989
You have won the final veto of
the summer.

31:57.990 --> 31:59.989
Oh, my goodness, I just won
the veto.

31:59.990 --> 32:00.990
This is everything.

32:00.991 --> 32:02.989
I think I've repaired my
relationship with Liz, and

32:02.990 --> 32:05.989
things with Johnny Mac seem to
be on the up and up.

32:05.990 --> 32:08.829
They're both going to be looking
at me to take them to final

32:08.830 --> 32:09.989
three but I can only take one.

32:09.990 --> 32:13.989
I've got an enormous decision in
front of me.

32:13.990 --> 32:14.990
Oh, my goodness!

32:14.991 --> 32:16.989
That was awesome!

32:16.990 --> 32:16.991
That was awesome.

32:16.991 --> 32:18.949
Hot!

32:18.950 --> 32:19.999
Vanessa winning means the world
to me!

32:20.000 --> 32:21.989
I am going to final three.

32:21.990 --> 32:26.119
But I have a little bit of doubt
because I don't want to be

32:26.120 --> 32:26.990
blindsided.

32:26.991 --> 32:30.989
She did it to Austin, so whons
what she's going to do?

32:30.990 --> 32:31.990
I hope I can trust her.

32:31.990 --> 32:32.990
Congratulations.

32:32.991 --> 32:35.989
Thank you, it's been an honor.

32:35.990 --> 32:39.119
Whooo!

32:39.120 --> 32:41.289
I might be in a lot of trouble.

32:41.290 --> 32:44.989
The only hope I have in this
game is whether Vanessa feels

32:44.990 --> 32:47.989
like it's better for her game
for me to stay or for me to go.

32:47.990 --> 32:48.700
Wow.

32:48.701 --> 32:54.989
That's terrible.

32:54.990 --> 32:59.409
Julie: With the power now
securely in her hands, Vanessa

32:59.410 --> 33:01.989
will surely remove herself from
the block.

33:01.990 --> 33:08.999
But having deals with both Liz
and John, she will now be forced
to save one and betray the
other.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.999
The live veto meeting and
eviction are next.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.999
Stay with us.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
( Cheers and applause )

33:27.990 --> 33:29.989
The Big Brother houseguests
have fought hard.

33:29.990 --> 33:33.989
They've laughed, cried, and
played their hearts out.

33:33.990 --> 33:38.989
And now get to award your
favorite houseguest $25,000 in
cash.

33:38.990 --> 33:41.989
The winner of the special prize
will be announced during the

33:41.990 --> 33:45.829
live season finale of "big
brother" on Wednesday, September

33:45.830 --> 33:46.989
23.

33:46.990 --> 33:51.990
Go to CBS.Com and vote for
your favorite houseguest now.

34:10.990 --> 34:12.989
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

34:12.990 --> 34:15.829
It's now time for the live veto
meeting and eviction and the

34:15.830 --> 34:17.989
power lies entirely with
Vanessa.

34:17.990 --> 34:20.989
Who will she singlehandedly send
to the jury house?

34:20.990 --> 34:22.989
It's time to find out.

34:22.990 --> 34:23.990
Hello, houseguests.

34:23.991 --> 34:25.989
Hi, Julie!

34:25.990 --> 34:29.989
Julie: Well, you will be
very happy to hear that the live

34:29.990 --> 34:33.989
finale of "Big Brother" will
take place one week from
tonight.

34:33.990 --> 34:35.989
That's the good news.

34:35.990 --> 34:40.989
The bad news is that the game is
about to end for one of you.

34:40.990 --> 34:42.989
And it's now time for the veto
meeting.

34:42.990 --> 34:46.989
Vanessa, as the winner of the
power of veto, you may use it to

34:46.990 --> 34:50.989
save John or yourself from the
chopping block, so please stand

34:50.990 --> 34:52.989
and gave us your decision.

34:52.990 --> 34:55.989
Julie, this is my golden
ticket to the time three and I'm

34:55.990 --> 34:56.990
going to take it.

34:56.991 --> 35:00.999
I'm going to use the veto on
myself.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.989
Julie: Since, Vanessa used
the veto, Liz, you are the only

35:04.990 --> 35:05.950
possible replacement nominee.

35:05.951 --> 35:07.989
Go ahead and take a seat next to
John over there.

35:07.990 --> 35:10.989
John and Liz, the two you have
been in the "Big Brother" house

35:10.990 --> 35:12.989
for 91 days.

35:12.990 --> 35:16.289
But for one of you, this will be
your last.

35:16.290 --> 35:20.989
I'd like to give each of you one
final chance to address Vanessa

35:20.990 --> 35:24.989
before she casts the sole vote
to evict.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.989
John, you're first.

35:26.990 --> 35:28.989
All right, guys.

35:28.990 --> 35:29.990
It's been an awesome summer.

35:29.991 --> 35:33.989
I've had fun.

35:33.990 --> 35:35.539
And I know a lot about you guys.

35:35.540 --> 35:40.989
I know that some of us aren't
too good at being discreet about

35:40.990 --> 35:43.989
being excited.

35:43.990 --> 35:50.989
So with that said, if they came
to hear me beg, they will be

35:50.990 --> 35:51.830
disappointed.

35:51.831 --> 35:53.949
The arbiter.

35:53.950 --> 35:53.988
( Laughter ).

35:53.989 --> 35:54.540
Julie: Thank you, John.

35:54.540 --> 35:55.120
Liz, it's your turn.

35:55.121 --> 36:00.289
This has been such a
challenging and intense game.

36:00.290 --> 36:03.989
Although it's easier to make
enemies in "Big Brother," I can

36:03.990 --> 36:07.989
only say that I've made so many
friends, and this has been such

36:07.990 --> 36:09.989
a phenomenal experience.

36:09.990 --> 36:12.949
Vanessa, I know you're going to
do what's best for your own

36:12.950 --> 36:14.989
game, and I just want you to
know that I have always had your

36:14.990 --> 36:17.989
back, and I always will, and I
would love nothing more than to

36:17.990 --> 36:19.989
continue on this "Big Brother"
journey with you guys.

36:19.990 --> 36:22.119
Thank you.

36:22.120 --> 36:22.990
Julie: Thank you, Liz.

36:22.990 --> 36:23.990
Thank you, both.

36:23.991 --> 36:26.989
Just a reminder, the evicted
houseguest will have only a few

36:26.990 --> 36:31.289
moments to say good-bye, gather
his or her belongings, and walk

36:31.290 --> 36:33.409
out the front door.

36:33.410 --> 36:36.989
Vanessa, please stand at the
head of the living room, face

36:36.990 --> 36:40.989
the two nominees, and cast your
vote to evict.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.949
All right, Johnny, listen,
you put some very tempting

36:44.950 --> 36:45.989
offers on the table this week.

36:45.990 --> 36:49.989
However, for me to believe the
things you're promising me, it

36:49.990 --> 36:52.989
requires me believing you'ring
about lg to go back on a

36:52.990 --> 36:55.989
game-long alliance with Steve
which, "a," either isn't true,

36:55.990 --> 36:59.989
or "b," is true, and means
you're willing to go back on a

36:59.990 --> 37:00.990
game-long alliance.

37:00.991 --> 37:03.999
So how I can trust the promises
you only recently made me.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.989
Ultimately I hope you can
respect this for the game move

37:06.990 --> 37:12.949
it is andon a personal level I
adore you but I have to go for

37:12.950 --> 37:13.989
the gold on this one.

37:13.990 --> 37:17.989
So despite how much I like you,
Johnny, I vote to evict you.

37:17.990 --> 37:20.989
Julie: It's official, John,
for the second time, you have

37:20.990 --> 37:25.989
been evicted from the "big
brother" house.

37:25.990 --> 37:28.989
All right.

37:28.990 --> 37:31.989
Tell Austin I said hi.

37:31.990 --> 37:32.990
Oh, I will.

37:32.991 --> 37:34.409
Good luck, guys.

37:34.410 --> 37:35.410
Bye, Johnny.

37:35.411 --> 37:36.949
See you.

37:36.950 --> 37:37.989
Rock star!

37:37.990 --> 37:39.989
Rock star!

37:39.990 --> 37:43.989
( Applause )
( Cheers and applause )

37:43.990 --> 37:47.989
Yeah!

37:47.990 --> 37:52.989
Julie: Have a seat please.

37:52.990 --> 37:53.000
Final three.

37:53.001 --> 37:55.539
I know!

37:55.540 --> 37:55.990
Such applause.

37:55.991 --> 37:57.989
What is the arbiter?

37:57.990 --> 37:59.989
Oh, my God.

37:59.990 --> 38:00.990
He got so much applause.

38:00.991 --> 38:03.289
I am still convinced he is a
twist.

38:03.290 --> 38:03.990
What is arbiter?

38:03.991 --> 38:05.989
I didn't hear what he said.

38:05.990 --> 38:08.289
He said something about the
arbiter, and I don't know what

38:08.290 --> 38:10.989
it was.

38:10.990 --> 38:14.989
Wow.

38:14.990 --> 38:16.999
Julie: Are you surprised to
be sitting here?

38:17.000 --> 38:17.990
No.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.409
Julie: Because it looked
like... we saw you and Vanessa

38:20.410 --> 38:21.989
say you guys had a final two.

38:21.990 --> 38:24.539
Did you ever believe you had a
final two with her?

38:24.540 --> 38:25.120
Not really.

38:25.121 --> 38:28.989
I tried best I could to cover my
bases in case I lost the veto,

38:28.990 --> 38:31.989
but if I lost it, I was pretty
much going.

38:31.990 --> 38:34.999
Julie: Would you have
honored a final two with her if

38:35.000 --> 38:37.539
you weren't sitting in a
nomination chair?

38:37.540 --> 38:40.989
No, I would have evicted her.

38:40.990 --> 38:40.991
( Laughter ).

38:40.991 --> 38:45.999
Julie: So neither of you
meant it when you said it?

38:46.000 --> 38:46.830
Yeah.

38:46.830 --> 38:46.990
Julie: That's honest.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.949
Watching you play brother, it
seemed like you loved living on

38:49.950 --> 38:50.290
the edge.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.989
At times you were erratic,
illogical.

38:52.990 --> 38:53.990
Yeah.

38:53.991 --> 38:55.989
Julie: Making...
>> yeah, it happened sometimes.

38:55.990 --> 38:58.989
Julie: Was this your
strategy or were you just trying

38:58.990 --> 38:59.990
to throw people off?

38:59.991 --> 39:01.989
I think so.

39:01.990 --> 39:06.989
Like I tried just all kind of
things.

39:06.990 --> 39:08.989
I didn't really know what I was
doing the whole time.

39:08.990 --> 39:11.989
Looking back on it, I wouldn't
have done things the same.

39:11.990 --> 39:13.989
I should have gotten rid of
Steve next week and maybe she

39:13.990 --> 39:16.989
wouldn't have had a choice but
to break you want showmance.

39:16.990 --> 39:19.989
That's probably where I made my
biggest mistake.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.989
Julie: Do you live your
life like this outside the

39:21.990 --> 39:22.540
house?

39:22.541 --> 39:23.989
Yeah, a little bit.

39:23.990 --> 39:24.830
It happens.

39:24.831 --> 39:28.119
Julie: Last week, you were
part of the Austin blindside.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.989
Yes.

39:29.990 --> 39:31.119
Julie: You're about to face
him.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.989
He's a big guy.

39:32.990 --> 39:33.990
Uh-huh.

39:33.990 --> 39:34.990
Julie: Are you nervous at
all?

39:34.991 --> 39:38.989
No, he's big, but he's
probably fine.

39:38.990 --> 39:39.290
( Laughter ).

39:39.291 --> 39:42.119
Julie: Before we send you
off, final thoughts?

39:42.120 --> 39:44.989
Um, good luck to them.

39:44.990 --> 39:47.119
They've been playing hard in
there.

39:47.120 --> 39:47.990
I guess.

39:47.991 --> 39:49.699
That's pretty much it.

39:49.700 --> 39:56.699
Julie: Who do you expect to
see in the final two?

39:56.700 --> 40:00.949
Probably Vanessa and Steve?

40:00.950 --> 40:01.989
I might go with that.

40:01.990 --> 40:03.989
Julie: That would be an
interesting match-up.

40:03.990 --> 40:04.990
Yeah, I think so.

40:04.991 --> 40:06.949
Julie: Johnny Mac, thank
you so much.

40:06.950 --> 40:07.989
Thank you.

40:07.990 --> 40:08.000
Julie: Stay right there.

40:08.001 --> 40:11.119
The finally three have been
determined, and Steve, Vanessa,

40:11.120 --> 40:13.989
and Liz are headed to finale
night.

40:13.990 --> 40:17.989
But first, they must face off
for the final and most important

40:17.990 --> 40:19.699
head of household competition of
the summer.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.989
And don't forget, tune in

40:22.990 --> 40:25.989

broncos take on the Kansas City

40:25.990 --> 40:29.989

Football starts here.

40:30.991 --> 40:32.289
Stay with us.

40:32.290 --> 40:34.990
( Cheers and applause )

40:49.990 --> 40:51.289
Outspoken.

40:51.290 --> 40:53.989
The most idiotic conversation.

40:53.990 --> 40:55.999
Then stop having it.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.119
Outrageous!

40:59.120 --> 41:01.989
The search is on for the next
"Big Brother" houseguests.

41:01.990 --> 41:03.989
Oh, my God!

41:03.990 --> 41:05.989
Why is everyone so beautiful?

41:05.990 --> 41:09.699
Do you have what it takes to
move in and compete in a

41:09.700 --> 41:11.989
three-month power struggle for a
half million dollars?

41:11.990 --> 41:13.119
Yes, yes, yes!

Good night.

42:29.990 --> 42:35.989

42:40.990 --> 42:41.990
And hold on.

42:41.990 --> 42:42.990
I love this.

42:42.991 --> 42:45.989
I'm not actually going to
drink this.

Cheers.

And "Big Brother 17."

42:52.830 --> 42:54.989
Yeah!

42:54.990 --> 42:56.989
This is what I'm talking about.

42:56.990 --> 42:57.990
Have you ever had champagne?

42:57.990 --> 42:57.991
Yeah.

42:57.991 --> 42:58.999
This is really good.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.989
Every time I tasted something
in here...

43:02.990 --> 43:06.989
It's actually really good.

43:06.990 --> 43:07.990
It's better than wine.

43:07.991 --> 43:09.989
I'm sure it is.

43:09.990 --> 43:10.990
So, thank you, "Big Brother."
